[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:00:02.440 --> 00:00:06.730
FREDERIK G. PFERDT: Welcome
to a very creative afternoon

00:00:06.730 --> 00:00:08.720
and an Authors AtGoogle Talk.

00:00:08.720 --> 00:00:09.740
My name is Frederik.

00:00:09.740 --> 00:00:13.592
Please join me in welcoming
David and Tom Kelley.

00:00:13.592 --> 00:00:15.802
[APPLAUSE]

00:00:15.802 --> 00:00:20.850
FREDERIK G. PFERDT: They've
just published recently a book,

00:00:20.850 --> 00:00:24.285
"Creative Confidence: Unleashing
the Creative Potential

00:00:24.285 --> 00:00:26.610
Within Us All."

00:00:26.610 --> 00:00:30.080
And I actually had the
pleasure of having lunch

00:00:30.080 --> 00:00:31.720
with Tom and David.

00:00:31.720 --> 00:00:34.750
And David asked me, I
think the second question,

00:00:34.750 --> 00:00:37.160
so what are we going to do here?

00:00:37.160 --> 00:00:39.720
Google is already very creative.

00:00:39.720 --> 00:00:44.050
So let us come back to
that question later on.

00:00:44.050 --> 00:00:46.680
So, Tom, you published
various books

00:00:46.680 --> 00:00:49.159
around innovation, "The
Art of Innovation,"

00:00:49.159 --> 00:00:51.200
"The Ten Faces of Innovation,"
bestselling books.

00:00:51.200 --> 00:00:52.033
TOM KELLEY: Uh, huh.

00:00:52.033 --> 00:00:55.580
FREDERIK G. PFERDT: So what
motivated you to really publish

00:00:55.580 --> 00:00:57.415
this book around
creative confidence now?

00:00:57.415 --> 00:00:58.860
TOM KELLEY: Sure.

00:00:58.860 --> 00:01:01.670
So this book is actually quite
different than my other books.

00:01:01.670 --> 00:01:03.150
It focuses more
on the individual.

00:01:03.150 --> 00:01:06.260
It's more about creativity
per se and stuff like that.

00:01:06.260 --> 00:01:08.915
So it has a business
audience, but it actually

00:01:08.915 --> 00:01:10.274
speaks to a broader audience.

00:01:10.274 --> 00:01:12.690
So we're a "New York Times"
bestseller as of two days ago.

00:01:12.690 --> 00:01:14.273
And it's not in the
business category.

00:01:14.273 --> 00:01:16.770
It's in the advice category,
which is quite different.

00:01:16.770 --> 00:01:18.750
But why'd I write this book?

00:01:18.750 --> 00:01:21.090
And really, the answer is,
you know, two chairs away

00:01:21.090 --> 00:01:23.820
from me is my brother.

00:01:23.820 --> 00:01:26.740
Back in 2007, David was sick.

00:01:26.740 --> 00:01:29.520
David had throat cancer.

00:01:29.520 --> 00:01:32.790
And they only gave him a
40% chance of survival.

00:01:32.790 --> 00:01:36.400
And, wow, in that situation,
you confront a lot of demons,

00:01:36.400 --> 00:01:37.614
you know.

00:01:37.614 --> 00:01:39.780
And that was hanging over
our heads for a long time.

00:01:39.780 --> 00:01:42.550
I spent most of the
year with him in '07.

00:01:42.550 --> 00:01:47.250
And after chemo and radiation,
and eventually surgery,

00:01:47.250 --> 00:01:52.980
toward the end of the year,
at least a possibility arose,

00:01:52.980 --> 00:01:55.105
became more tangible, that
he was going to survive,

00:01:55.105 --> 00:01:57.740
And, you know, you
can see, he's there.

00:01:57.740 --> 00:02:02.610
That's the answer
six years later,

00:02:02.610 --> 00:02:06.540
And so we had talked
about the future all year.

00:02:06.540 --> 00:02:09.180
And so late in
2007, then we did.

00:02:09.180 --> 00:02:11.900
We felt like we had permission
to talk about the future.

00:02:11.900 --> 00:02:15.260
And so as we did that, we made
two promises to each other.

00:02:15.260 --> 00:02:18.310
David and I have worked
together for almost 30 years.

00:02:18.310 --> 00:02:20.810
And the two promises
were, one, that we

00:02:20.810 --> 00:02:21.970
would take a trip together.

00:02:21.970 --> 00:02:27.090
Because, oddly, we have never
traveled together as adults.

00:02:27.090 --> 00:02:29.320
Our big trip was in 1967.

00:02:29.320 --> 00:02:32.525
We drove from Ohio to
California, you know,

00:02:32.525 --> 00:02:34.670
the promised land.

00:02:34.670 --> 00:02:40.600
And so in our work
at IDEO, if one of us

00:02:40.600 --> 00:02:42.592
goes to a meeting
in Grand Rapids

00:02:42.592 --> 00:02:44.800
or wherever, the other one
doesn't have to go, right?

00:02:44.800 --> 00:02:46.133
And so we don't travel together.

00:02:46.133 --> 00:02:48.240
So promise number one is
to do a trip together.

00:02:48.240 --> 00:02:53.110
And that became this really
fun trip to Tokyo and Kyoto,

00:02:53.110 --> 00:02:54.432
two places that I really like.

00:02:54.432 --> 00:02:55.390
And, oh, I got to pick.

00:02:55.390 --> 00:02:57.475
So I picked.

00:02:57.475 --> 00:02:59.100
But then, the other
promise was that we

00:02:59.100 --> 00:03:00.170
would do a project together.

00:03:00.170 --> 00:03:01.970
David and I are not
very good at leisure.

00:03:01.970 --> 00:03:06.490
You know, we're couldn't
just hang out for some months

00:03:06.490 --> 00:03:08.480
together or play
golf or I don't know.

00:03:08.480 --> 00:03:10.651
Just not in our DNA.

00:03:10.651 --> 00:03:12.400
And so if you want to
spend time together,

00:03:12.400 --> 00:03:14.190
you got to think of something
to work on together.

00:03:14.190 --> 00:03:15.700
And so we said
we'd do a project.

00:03:15.700 --> 00:03:18.116
And at that time we didn't
know what the project would be.

00:03:18.116 --> 00:03:19.950
But the project became a book.

00:03:19.950 --> 00:03:22.116
It became the book called
"Creative Confidence" that

00:03:22.116 --> 00:03:22.780
is sitting right there.

00:03:22.780 --> 00:03:24.350
DAVID KELLEY: Yeah,
I actually highly

00:03:24.350 --> 00:03:26.620
recommend being diagnosed
with a terminal disease.

00:03:26.620 --> 00:03:27.120
Just--

00:03:27.120 --> 00:03:28.046
[LAUGHTER]

00:03:28.046 --> 00:03:29.920
DAVID KELLEY: --don't
get a terminal disease.

00:03:29.920 --> 00:03:32.660
But if you could fake
yourself into really believing

00:03:32.660 --> 00:03:34.870
that for a while, it's
kind of cathartic.

00:03:34.870 --> 00:03:36.320
It'll straighten you right up.

00:03:36.320 --> 00:03:38.598
You'll do all kinds
of different things.

00:03:38.598 --> 00:03:40.380
[LAUGHTER]

00:03:40.380 --> 00:03:42.380
FREDERIK G. PFERDT:
Speaking of different things

00:03:42.380 --> 00:03:44.720
you did in your life,
David, you founded

00:03:44.720 --> 00:03:47.800
a very successful
company called IDEO.

00:03:47.800 --> 00:03:50.850
You also started an educational
institution called the Stanford

00:03:50.850 --> 00:03:53.040
d.school.

00:03:53.040 --> 00:03:56.995
So you also started a
revolution around innovation

00:03:56.995 --> 00:04:00.140
and innovators in general
and using design thinking

00:04:00.140 --> 00:04:02.805
as a framework to really
push that forward.

00:04:02.805 --> 00:04:04.800
Can you speak a
little bit about what

00:04:04.800 --> 00:04:07.911
you have learned
throughout the years,

00:04:07.911 --> 00:04:10.160
about innovation in general
but also about innovators?

00:04:10.160 --> 00:04:11.140
DAVID KELLEY: Yeah.

00:04:11.140 --> 00:04:15.436
Well, you know, I
mean, we think of IDEO

00:04:15.436 --> 00:04:17.769
as a successful company, you
know, as this little thing.

00:04:17.769 --> 00:04:21.100
When you come here, and it
would fit in one cafeteria,

00:04:21.100 --> 00:04:23.130
it doesn't feel that big a deal.

00:04:31.630 --> 00:04:32.770
There's a couple things.

00:04:32.770 --> 00:04:35.420
So one, I'm really
proud of IDEO.

00:04:35.420 --> 00:04:37.380
You know, you get a
bunch of designers

00:04:37.380 --> 00:04:40.390
together and then give them a
really difficult problem-- you

00:04:40.390 --> 00:04:44.370
know, fix the educational
system in Peru,

00:04:44.370 --> 00:04:48.590
or improve the experience of
checking into the Mayo Clinic,

00:04:48.590 --> 00:04:52.660
or whatever-- and they come
up with really wonderful,

00:04:52.660 --> 00:04:55.620
new to the world,
viable solutions.

00:04:55.620 --> 00:04:57.480
And that feels really good.

00:04:57.480 --> 00:05:01.750
And at the d.school--
d.school's successful

00:05:01.750 --> 00:05:03.180
beyond my wildest
dreams-- and you

00:05:03.180 --> 00:05:07.180
see people flip from
thinking of themselves

00:05:07.180 --> 00:05:09.660
as not creative to thinking
of themselves as creative.

00:05:09.660 --> 00:05:12.110
And it impacts
their entire life,

00:05:12.110 --> 00:05:16.460
the number of people
that kind of come to me

00:05:16.460 --> 00:05:19.205
and say, this thing's changed
my life, as an educator,

00:05:19.205 --> 00:05:23.870
it feels great, especially
since for the first kind of 20

00:05:23.870 --> 00:05:26.890
years of my academic career,
I was the design guy.

00:05:26.890 --> 00:05:30.271
So when somebody important
in the university

00:05:30.271 --> 00:05:31.770
came to see me,
they wanted to know,

00:05:31.770 --> 00:05:35.835
where did you get those shoes,
or where I get cool glasses,

00:05:35.835 --> 00:05:36.650
you know?

00:05:36.650 --> 00:05:40.950
Now, they're coming
with strategic questions

00:05:40.950 --> 00:05:43.310
about what's the future
of higher education,

00:05:43.310 --> 00:05:44.330
and can we work on that?

00:05:44.330 --> 00:05:48.660
So I'm just saying it surprised
me and it's really exciting.

00:05:51.730 --> 00:05:53.280
We could go on
and on about that.

00:05:53.280 --> 00:05:55.860
But if you just want to think
about the highlights of what

00:05:55.860 --> 00:06:01.140
we found, the first
thing is that being

00:06:01.140 --> 00:06:04.340
human-centered results
in new innovation.

00:06:04.340 --> 00:06:07.800
So if you think that there's
lots of companies and people

00:06:07.800 --> 00:06:11.070
working on coming up
with new business ideas

00:06:11.070 --> 00:06:15.350
and then trying to understand
how people might accept them.

00:06:15.350 --> 00:06:18.570
And then, there's lots of people
coming up with technology ideas

00:06:18.570 --> 00:06:22.400
and trying to figure out how
the business side of that

00:06:22.400 --> 00:06:24.450
might work and how
people might accept that.

00:06:24.450 --> 00:06:28.010
And we found that, for
us, for design types,

00:06:28.010 --> 00:06:31.520
the best approach is to
come in from the human side,

00:06:31.520 --> 00:06:36.180
like what do people value,
what's meaningful for people,

00:06:36.180 --> 00:06:38.570
and then go out and try to
find technologies and business

00:06:38.570 --> 00:06:39.840
solutions to those problems.

00:06:39.840 --> 00:06:44.780
So that seems to be, for
us, the number one thing.

00:06:44.780 --> 00:06:52.670
This empathy for people is the
best way to lead to innovation.

00:06:52.670 --> 00:06:55.010
And the other thing
is that this is

00:06:55.010 --> 00:06:56.267
a team sport, this innovation.

00:06:56.267 --> 00:06:57.600
I mean, there's the lone genius.

00:06:57.600 --> 00:07:00.500
I mean, if you've got Leonardo
da Vinci on your team,

00:07:00.500 --> 00:07:01.420
you're set, you know.

00:07:01.420 --> 00:07:01.920
[LAUGHTER]

00:07:01.920 --> 00:07:05.270
DAVID KELLEY: But if
you don't, then it's

00:07:05.270 --> 00:07:08.520
really important to have
a team that's very diverse

00:07:08.520 --> 00:07:10.310
and that they work together.

00:07:10.310 --> 00:07:11.910
They have had
different experiences.

00:07:11.910 --> 00:07:13.576
And they have different
points of views.

00:07:13.576 --> 00:07:16.430
And then, if you can get them
to work together and build on

00:07:16.430 --> 00:07:19.904
each other's ideas rather
than just kind of show

00:07:19.904 --> 00:07:21.320
how smart you are
by saying what's

00:07:21.320 --> 00:07:22.630
wrong with the
other person's idea,

00:07:22.630 --> 00:07:23.900
if you can get to build on them.

00:07:23.900 --> 00:07:25.340
And what happened
at the d.school,

00:07:25.340 --> 00:07:27.550
I believe-- lots of things
happened at the d.school--

00:07:27.550 --> 00:07:29.422
but the thing I
believe is that we'd

00:07:29.422 --> 00:07:31.130
been trying to do
multidisciplinary stuff

00:07:31.130 --> 00:07:33.297
at the university for a
long time but, you may know,

00:07:33.297 --> 00:07:35.921
if you've been in a university,
that it's the opposite of that.

00:07:35.921 --> 00:07:36.840
It's in deep silos.

00:07:36.840 --> 00:07:38.399
And people are
winning Nobel Prizes.

00:07:38.399 --> 00:07:40.440
And I would hope that they
would keep doing that.

00:07:40.440 --> 00:07:42.490
I'm not trying to talk
people out of going deep.

00:07:42.490 --> 00:07:43.739
I think that's very important.

00:07:43.739 --> 00:07:49.070
But we kind of miss things
in between these deep silos

00:07:49.070 --> 00:07:49.710
of knowledge.

00:07:49.710 --> 00:07:54.960
And so what we found is
that by having people

00:07:54.960 --> 00:07:58.950
from different disciplines, you
get to these kind of big ideas

00:07:58.950 --> 00:08:02.850
that are between
disciplines by using methods

00:08:02.850 --> 00:08:06.321
like design thinking and
having these diverse teams that

00:08:06.321 --> 00:08:07.320
can build on each other.

00:08:07.320 --> 00:08:11.032
So that's the basic
thing that's happened.

00:08:11.032 --> 00:08:12.990
FREDERIK G. PFERDT: You
both write in your book

00:08:12.990 --> 00:08:16.400
that you want to make
the world a better place

00:08:16.400 --> 00:08:20.912
through embracing creative
confidence in our lives.

00:08:20.912 --> 00:08:23.020
At Google, we have
a similar mission

00:08:23.020 --> 00:08:26.740
on making the world a better
place through technology.

00:08:26.740 --> 00:08:29.165
So where do you
see the parallels

00:08:29.165 --> 00:08:32.434
in what you're trying
to achieve and what

00:08:32.434 --> 00:08:34.100
we're trying to achieve
with technology.

00:08:34.100 --> 00:08:34.808
TOM KELLEY: Sure.

00:08:34.808 --> 00:08:37.789
I mean, those two are not in
conflict in any way, right?

00:08:37.789 --> 00:08:43.070
What we're seeing is this
trend, this kind of maker trend,

00:08:43.070 --> 00:08:45.880
that we've experienced both
in our teams and in the world

00:08:45.880 --> 00:08:50.200
at large, in which
new technologies put

00:08:50.200 --> 00:08:52.785
creative tools in
everybody's hands.

00:08:52.785 --> 00:08:55.910
You know, there's that old line
about, in the 20th century,

00:08:55.910 --> 00:08:56.660
kids watch TV.

00:08:56.660 --> 00:08:58.077
In the 21st century,
kids make TV.

00:08:58.077 --> 00:08:59.618
I think they're
talking about YouTube

00:08:59.618 --> 00:09:00.860
when they say that, right?

00:09:00.860 --> 00:09:04.620
And so I think the
two go hand in hand.

00:09:04.620 --> 00:09:06.110
I mean, we just
maybe approach it

00:09:06.110 --> 00:09:07.850
from a slightly
different direction.

00:09:07.850 --> 00:09:11.850
But one of the things that
we've latched on to early on

00:09:11.850 --> 00:09:14.850
is a year or two ago there
was an Adobe study called

00:09:14.850 --> 00:09:17.960
"State of Create,"
in which they, you

00:09:17.960 --> 00:09:19.980
know, with an interest
not unlike yours--

00:09:19.980 --> 00:09:24.200
they want to use technology
to help people in their focus

00:09:24.200 --> 00:09:26.820
on creativity-- and so they
ask 5,000 people in five

00:09:26.820 --> 00:09:29.220
different countries
about their beliefs

00:09:29.220 --> 00:09:31.390
surrounding creativity--
one about the link

00:09:31.390 --> 00:09:33.500
between creativity and
economic development.

00:09:33.500 --> 00:09:35.910
And 80% of people
said, unlocking

00:09:35.910 --> 00:09:38.920
creativity is critical to
economic development, which

00:09:38.920 --> 00:09:40.000
we thought was great.

00:09:40.000 --> 00:09:42.970
But really interesting was
the follow-on question.

00:09:42.970 --> 00:09:45.000
And they said,
well, how about you?

00:09:45.000 --> 00:09:46.970
How about you as an individual?

00:09:46.970 --> 00:09:50.690
Do you have a chance to live
up to your creative potential?

00:09:50.690 --> 00:09:52.190
In other words, do
you have a chance

00:09:52.190 --> 00:09:53.720
to bring your
whole self to work?

00:09:53.720 --> 00:09:58.820
And across the world, only 25%
of the people said yes to that.

00:09:58.820 --> 00:10:00.840
And so we think
it's a worthy goal.

00:10:00.840 --> 00:10:04.650
I mean, it's a worthy
question, for us and for you,

00:10:04.650 --> 00:10:07.495
of how might we
unlock the creativity

00:10:07.495 --> 00:10:10.150
of the other 75%, right?

00:10:10.150 --> 00:10:12.630
And so you might
approach that question

00:10:12.630 --> 00:10:15.260
from a slightly different
direction than us.

00:10:15.260 --> 00:10:17.780
But I think we're
both quite interested

00:10:17.780 --> 00:10:20.490
in how to change the
world in that way.

00:10:20.490 --> 00:10:22.950
DAVID KELLY: You just
have 42,000 people on it.

00:10:22.950 --> 00:10:23.860
We have five.

00:10:23.860 --> 00:10:24.954
[LAUGHTER]

00:10:24.954 --> 00:10:26.370
FREDERIK G. PFERDT:
So coming back

00:10:26.370 --> 00:10:30.060
to that question, so how
would you actually recommend

00:10:30.060 --> 00:10:31.900
organizations going
about unlocking

00:10:31.900 --> 00:10:34.959
the potential of creative
people in their organizations?

00:10:34.959 --> 00:10:35.750
DAVID KELLEY: Yeah.

00:10:35.750 --> 00:10:38.120
I'm not sure this applies
to Google, as I said before,

00:10:38.120 --> 00:10:41.650
but what we find is that
you have to have support

00:10:41.650 --> 00:10:45.290
from the top of the company
that the experiments are allowed

00:10:45.290 --> 00:10:45.790
to happen.

00:10:45.790 --> 00:10:48.350
But it's all really
about small experiments.

00:10:48.350 --> 00:10:51.010
It's all about starting a
bunch of little brush fires

00:10:51.010 --> 00:10:52.800
in different places
in the company

00:10:52.800 --> 00:10:54.436
and hoping that
they kind of, you

00:10:54.436 --> 00:10:57.060
know, catch on
and grow together.

00:10:57.060 --> 00:11:01.440
So we, in all of our
exec eds at the d.school,

00:11:01.440 --> 00:11:07.790
from the minute the people
come to go through our program

00:11:07.790 --> 00:11:09.610
and learn our
methods and stuff, we

00:11:09.610 --> 00:11:11.900
focus on what are they going
to do when they get back?

00:11:11.900 --> 00:11:15.450
I mean, how do you
implement when you get back,

00:11:15.450 --> 00:11:18.830
and how are you going to
protect these ideas and stuff?

00:11:18.830 --> 00:11:21.350
Because one of the
things, and early on,

00:11:21.350 --> 00:11:24.097
is that people would have
this cathartic experience.

00:11:24.097 --> 00:11:24.930
Then they'd go back.

00:11:24.930 --> 00:11:28.240
And the mass of the place,
the habit of the place

00:11:28.240 --> 00:11:30.550
they were going to,
was just too extreme

00:11:30.550 --> 00:11:32.000
for them to catch hold, right?

00:11:32.000 --> 00:11:34.990
And so we spend a
lot of time trying

00:11:34.990 --> 00:11:39.340
to understand how
you kind of come up

00:11:39.340 --> 00:11:43.000
with these ideas in a
way that can be accepted

00:11:43.000 --> 00:11:44.797
by the rest of the organization.

00:11:44.797 --> 00:11:45.631
TOM KELLEY: Yeah.

00:11:45.631 --> 00:11:48.750
You know, in cultures there's
a really important moment we've

00:11:48.750 --> 00:11:49.510
discovered.

00:11:49.510 --> 00:11:52.360
And I personally have worked
with 1,500 clients, and David,

00:11:52.360 --> 00:11:53.910
I'm sure, a lot more.

00:11:53.910 --> 00:11:55.770
And there's a really
important moment

00:11:55.770 --> 00:12:01.370
in which a not yet perfect
idea gets put on the table.

00:12:01.370 --> 00:12:04.376
And people look
really closely to see

00:12:04.376 --> 00:12:07.716
how do leaders
especially react to that.

00:12:07.716 --> 00:12:09.590
You know, you've probably
heard those stories

00:12:09.590 --> 00:12:12.310
about the tyrant boss who, you
bring in the unfinished thing,

00:12:12.310 --> 00:12:14.290
and they say, how
would our organization

00:12:14.290 --> 00:12:16.840
be worse if you weren't
here tomorrow, you know,

00:12:16.840 --> 00:12:19.380
that kind of, like,
get out of my office,

00:12:19.380 --> 00:12:21.380
because you haven't thought
through every detail

00:12:21.380 --> 00:12:22.930
of this idea yet.

00:12:22.930 --> 00:12:25.850
But in great cultures,
in creative cultures,

00:12:25.850 --> 00:12:29.640
the first instinct is
to build on the idea.

00:12:29.640 --> 00:12:32.320
There's a skill
we call squinting,

00:12:32.320 --> 00:12:34.600
in which you ignore
the surface details

00:12:34.600 --> 00:12:36.540
and you look at the
shape of the idea

00:12:36.540 --> 00:12:38.720
and try to figure out how
could you make it better.

00:12:38.720 --> 00:12:42.330
And if the leaders of an
organization are squinters,

00:12:42.330 --> 00:12:43.830
you know, are the
kind of people who

00:12:43.830 --> 00:12:46.100
look past the
surface details, what

00:12:46.100 --> 00:12:51.447
we found is, there's a better
idea flow within the company.

00:12:51.447 --> 00:12:53.780
More ideas come up, because
you don't have to self-edit.

00:12:53.780 --> 00:12:55.863
You don't have to wait
until your idea is perfect.

00:12:55.863 --> 00:12:58.320
You bring it out in
its embryonic form

00:12:58.320 --> 00:13:00.980
and say, well, I'm thinking
about this, because you're

00:13:00.980 --> 00:13:04.130
allowed to kind of think
out loud about things.

00:13:04.130 --> 00:13:07.540
You know, here in the Valley,
ask any venture capitalist,

00:13:07.540 --> 00:13:10.400
and they will tell you that
all other things equal,

00:13:10.400 --> 00:13:12.250
the VC firm with
the better deal flow

00:13:12.250 --> 00:13:15.500
wins, right, because they're
picking from 1,000 instead

00:13:15.500 --> 00:13:18.570
of picking from
five possibilities.

00:13:18.570 --> 00:13:21.650
And so we think it's true
with companies with idea flow.

00:13:21.650 --> 00:13:24.150
If you're the kind of company--
and I know that in many ways

00:13:24.150 --> 00:13:27.180
you are-- if you're the kind
of company in which ideas get

00:13:27.180 --> 00:13:30.200
circulated all of the time--
and many fall by the wayside,

00:13:30.200 --> 00:13:34.780
because they're not yet perfect
or because they don't pan out--

00:13:34.780 --> 00:13:40.060
you still have this rich
culture of ideas to choose from.

00:13:40.060 --> 00:13:42.490
What we found is that those
are the companies that

00:13:42.490 --> 00:13:45.446
succeed and sustain
in the long run.

00:13:45.446 --> 00:13:46.820
FREDERIK G. PFERDT:
So let's move

00:13:46.820 --> 00:13:48.986
from an organizational level
to an individual level.

00:13:48.986 --> 00:13:50.984
I think that's very interesting.

00:13:50.984 --> 00:13:52.400
So what prevents,
actually, people

00:13:52.400 --> 00:13:54.066
for having those
creative breakthroughs?

00:13:54.066 --> 00:13:57.692
So is there a routine,
especially like if, maybe, you

00:13:57.692 --> 00:13:59.900
have a personal routine you
want to share about David

00:13:59.900 --> 00:14:01.316
or David wants to
share about Tom,

00:14:01.316 --> 00:14:05.890
like how you actually
train the creative muscle,

00:14:05.890 --> 00:14:07.350
if that's even possible.

00:14:07.350 --> 00:14:09.744
So some people do meditation,
and they would go work out.

00:14:09.744 --> 00:14:10.660
So what are you doing?

00:14:10.660 --> 00:14:13.360
DAVID KELLEY: Well, again--
I don't know about Google

00:14:13.360 --> 00:14:15.110
and that it makes sense
now about Google--

00:14:15.110 --> 00:14:19.625
but what's really going
on in these people that

00:14:19.625 --> 00:14:21.507
aren't confident in
their creative ability

00:14:21.507 --> 00:14:23.590
is something happened to
them when they were kids,

00:14:23.590 --> 00:14:27.160
and they opted out of thinking
of themselves as creative.

00:14:27.160 --> 00:14:29.619
They think of themselves only
as analytical, which is fine.

00:14:29.619 --> 00:14:31.160
We're not saying
don't be analytical.

00:14:31.160 --> 00:14:33.040
We're saying be
creative, as well.

00:14:33.040 --> 00:14:36.190
And so what happens
is they develop

00:14:36.190 --> 00:14:40.620
this fear of kind
of owning an idea.

00:14:40.620 --> 00:14:43.260
Like you don't want to
be the person who came up

00:14:43.260 --> 00:14:47.920
with that idea, because then
as it goes through the company,

00:14:47.920 --> 00:14:51.060
and if it doesn't work, then
you are labeled with that idea.

00:14:51.060 --> 00:14:54.080
So it's that kind of
fear of being judged.

00:14:54.080 --> 00:14:58.950
And so, I mean,
whatever it is-- I mean,

00:14:58.950 --> 00:15:01.620
I don't understand Google's
culture-- but whatever it is,

00:15:01.620 --> 00:15:05.030
there's fears that
can be alleviated

00:15:05.030 --> 00:15:09.000
by this process we
call guided mastery.

00:15:09.000 --> 00:15:10.830
And some of you may
have seen my TED Talk.

00:15:10.830 --> 00:15:13.540
I talked about this
guy that I really

00:15:13.540 --> 00:15:15.800
kind of got to
enjoy at Stanford.

00:15:15.800 --> 00:15:17.590
His name is Albert Bandura.

00:15:17.590 --> 00:15:20.260
If you're a psychology major,
you know who Albert Bandura is.

00:15:20.260 --> 00:15:24.790
He's like the most cited
psychologist in the world,

00:15:24.790 --> 00:15:26.790
living.

00:15:26.790 --> 00:15:30.740
Freud probably has more
citations somewhere.

00:15:30.740 --> 00:15:34.740
And when I met
him, he was talking

00:15:34.740 --> 00:15:37.650
about this kind
of curing phobias.

00:15:37.650 --> 00:15:40.160
Now, lots of people
that we run into

00:15:40.160 --> 00:15:42.100
have this fear of being judged.

00:15:42.100 --> 00:15:44.150
And it turns out, it's
the same deal as far as

00:15:44.150 --> 00:15:46.950
how you get around
it, how you change

00:15:46.950 --> 00:15:49.160
the way you think of
that, of yourself.

00:15:49.160 --> 00:15:52.600
And so he was curing
snakes and spiders

00:15:52.600 --> 00:15:54.810
phobias and stuff like that.

00:15:54.810 --> 00:15:57.450
And the way he did it, in this
thing called guided mastery,

00:15:57.450 --> 00:15:59.770
is he takes people through
a series of small steps,

00:15:59.770 --> 00:16:00.680
you know, baby steps.

00:16:00.680 --> 00:16:03.030
And each one, they're
successful at it.

00:16:03.030 --> 00:16:05.560
So you're looking at the
snake through the mirror.

00:16:05.560 --> 00:16:08.550
And then 15 steps
later, you're standing

00:16:08.550 --> 00:16:11.960
at the door, your
hand being held.

00:16:11.960 --> 00:16:13.780
Then you get to
a welder's glove.

00:16:13.780 --> 00:16:15.300
And eventually, you
touch the snake.

00:16:15.300 --> 00:16:20.255
But there's a guy who's got a
near 100% cure rate of people

00:16:20.255 --> 00:16:21.380
with these kind of phobias.

00:16:21.380 --> 00:16:23.780
And they've had these
phobias their whole lives,

00:16:23.780 --> 00:16:26.120
and they're not going
outside or going on a hike

00:16:26.120 --> 00:16:27.690
because there might
be a snake there.

00:16:27.690 --> 00:16:29.830
And he can cure them
through this guided mastery.

00:16:29.830 --> 00:16:32.420
So what we feel, when you
talk about the individual,

00:16:32.420 --> 00:16:35.150
we know, at the d.school
and IDEO, anyplace,

00:16:35.150 --> 00:16:40.650
if we take people who have
this fear of being judged

00:16:40.650 --> 00:16:43.500
or of failing or whatever
in the workplace,

00:16:43.500 --> 00:16:46.450
and we can take them through
a series of successes--

00:16:46.450 --> 00:16:48.789
we give them a small
project just like when

00:16:48.789 --> 00:16:49.830
you were at the d.school.

00:16:49.830 --> 00:16:53.160
You know, we have
a small project

00:16:53.160 --> 00:16:55.290
that you can be
somewhat successful at.

00:16:55.290 --> 00:16:58.240
And then we increase the
complexity and the scope

00:16:58.240 --> 00:17:00.370
and the team size and
all of that stuff.

00:17:00.370 --> 00:17:03.880
And it's not that long,
after a few projects,

00:17:03.880 --> 00:17:07.170
that you're thinking, oh, my,
god, I am a creative person.

00:17:07.170 --> 00:17:11.280
So for the book, we interviewed
100 people, most of them

00:17:11.280 --> 00:17:13.380
from the d.school,
and just talking

00:17:13.380 --> 00:17:16.290
about their extraordinary
transformation

00:17:16.290 --> 00:17:20.089
by gaining this feeling in
their bodies of being creative.

00:17:20.089 --> 00:17:25.500
And so it's pretty
amazing to watch

00:17:25.500 --> 00:17:28.270
how this can be transformative
to the individual.

00:17:30.920 --> 00:17:33.010
FREDERIK G. PFERDT:
You spoke a little bit

00:17:33.010 --> 00:17:37.880
about this beginner's
mind or child's mind,

00:17:37.880 --> 00:17:42.630
and you quoted, I
think, a lot of times,

00:17:42.630 --> 00:17:46.580
that you should really embrace
that in everything you're

00:17:46.580 --> 00:17:47.100
doing.

00:17:47.100 --> 00:17:52.300
So what would you actually
recommend for parents then?

00:17:52.300 --> 00:17:54.320
Because I saw that in
your book, you also

00:17:54.320 --> 00:17:56.204
dedicate your book
to your parents.

00:17:56.204 --> 00:17:58.370
What would you recommend--
that's the first question

00:17:58.370 --> 00:18:02.610
for you-- for parents, what
they should do with their kids?

00:18:02.610 --> 00:18:05.080
But secondly, how
did your parents

00:18:05.080 --> 00:18:08.080
influence you
throughout your lives?

00:18:08.080 --> 00:18:10.690
TOM KELLEY: Sure.

00:18:10.690 --> 00:18:12.650
You know, this
parenting thing is hard,

00:18:12.650 --> 00:18:14.210
as you've probably noticed.

00:18:14.210 --> 00:18:16.220
Those kids don't come
with instruction sets.

00:18:16.220 --> 00:18:18.470
It's sometimes hard
to know, is this

00:18:18.470 --> 00:18:19.720
where I'm supposed to be firm?

00:18:19.720 --> 00:18:22.220
Is this where I'm supposed to
be laissez-faire, or whatever?

00:18:22.220 --> 00:18:24.155
But just think
about our parents.

00:18:24.155 --> 00:18:28.260
It wasn't that they were
artists or something.

00:18:28.260 --> 00:18:31.750
It wasn't that they got out
the finger paints with us

00:18:31.750 --> 00:18:32.660
every day.

00:18:32.660 --> 00:18:35.850
It was that they give us a
lot of space to do things,

00:18:35.850 --> 00:18:37.940
that they weren't
quick to judge us

00:18:37.940 --> 00:18:40.942
or to kind of reign us in
when we got a little creative.

00:18:40.942 --> 00:18:42.650
You know, David and
I took a lot of stuff

00:18:42.650 --> 00:18:45.510
apart as kids, including
the family piano.

00:18:45.510 --> 00:18:48.159
And many of those things
never went back together.

00:18:48.159 --> 00:18:49.700
A piano, once you
take it apart, it's

00:18:49.700 --> 00:18:50.824
actually kind of beautiful.

00:18:50.824 --> 00:18:52.970
Those 88 hammers, David's
got those up on his wall.

00:18:52.970 --> 00:18:55.040
But nobody ever played
that piano afterwards.

00:18:55.040 --> 00:18:57.050
And the parents
never complained.

00:18:57.050 --> 00:19:00.040
And so I think it's
just kind of permission

00:19:00.040 --> 00:19:03.090
to misbehave a little bit,
permission to be creative.

00:19:03.090 --> 00:19:06.680
And you have this sort
of nurturing environment

00:19:06.680 --> 00:19:09.200
that says, and it's still
going to be OK, right?

00:19:09.200 --> 00:19:11.540
And so that's really what
our parents did for us.

00:19:11.540 --> 00:19:14.500
And that's what I've
tried to do for my kids.

00:19:14.500 --> 00:19:18.250
DAVID KELLEY: It could be
called benign neglect, right?

00:19:18.250 --> 00:19:21.180
So we got away with it.

00:19:21.180 --> 00:19:23.020
The one I remember
the most, or that I've

00:19:23.020 --> 00:19:26.770
been told the most it
was hardest to take, was,

00:19:26.770 --> 00:19:27.670
so, I was 12.

00:19:27.670 --> 00:19:30.606
I got a brand new
red Schwinn bicycle.

00:19:30.606 --> 00:19:32.410
You can imagine,
that's a big gift.

00:19:32.410 --> 00:19:35.800
We're, you know, relatively
not that well-heeled a family.

00:19:35.800 --> 00:19:37.520
And so a Schwinn
bike was a big deal.

00:19:37.520 --> 00:19:40.630
And somehow the next day I
took it out and sandblasted it

00:19:40.630 --> 00:19:43.446
and painted it
fluorescent green.

00:19:43.446 --> 00:19:45.320
And so, I can imagine,
that was a little hard

00:19:45.320 --> 00:19:47.007
to look the other way.

00:19:47.007 --> 00:19:49.340
TOM KELLEY: Well, speaking
of fluorescent green, so, OK,

00:19:49.340 --> 00:19:50.334
that was David's bike.

00:19:50.334 --> 00:19:52.500
And so it's kind of his to
do whatever he wanted to.

00:19:52.500 --> 00:19:55.130
But he came home from college--
he went to Carnegie Mellon

00:19:55.130 --> 00:19:57.463
as an undergrad-- and he came
home from college freshman

00:19:57.463 --> 00:20:00.440
year, and he got four
shades of green paint,

00:20:00.440 --> 00:20:03.440
including fluorescent
green, and painted a stripe,

00:20:03.440 --> 00:20:06.340
like four feet high
and 40 feet long,

00:20:06.340 --> 00:20:08.970
against the back
wall of the house.

00:20:08.970 --> 00:20:12.020
And you can imagine a parent
in a small town in Ohio

00:20:12.020 --> 00:20:13.770
being not sure
about that, right?

00:20:13.770 --> 00:20:16.750
But that green stripe's still
there all these years later.

00:20:16.750 --> 00:20:18.650
DAVID KELLEY: Yeah,
you're mostly too young.

00:20:18.650 --> 00:20:21.664
But this was the era of
super graphics, right?

00:20:21.664 --> 00:20:24.472
FREDERIK G. PFERDT: So
what changed about David?

00:20:24.472 --> 00:20:25.945
[LAUGHTER]

00:20:25.945 --> 00:20:28.077
TOM KELLEY: You can Google that.

00:20:28.077 --> 00:20:29.160
FREDERIK G. PFERDT: Great.

00:20:29.160 --> 00:20:31.970
What changed about David
over the years, then?

00:20:31.970 --> 00:20:33.390
You spoke about when he was 12.

00:20:33.390 --> 00:20:35.990
But what's really now when
you say, oh, David, that's

00:20:35.990 --> 00:20:38.572
really why you're
childlike, not childish?

00:20:38.572 --> 00:20:39.280
TOM KELLEY: Sure.

00:20:39.280 --> 00:20:41.844
So there's that great
quote from Picasso.

00:20:41.844 --> 00:20:43.260
He says, every
child is an artist,

00:20:43.260 --> 00:20:47.340
and the challenge is to remain
an artist after you grow up.

00:20:47.340 --> 00:20:50.010
So David and I were
quite different as kids.

00:20:50.010 --> 00:20:54.520
And the thing about David
is he had indication,

00:20:54.520 --> 00:20:57.110
there were tells even
as a small child,

00:20:57.110 --> 00:20:58.590
that he was going
to be creative,

00:20:58.590 --> 00:21:02.950
that he was going to become a
designer one day or something,

00:21:02.950 --> 00:21:04.710
whereas I was the opposite.

00:21:04.710 --> 00:21:06.780
You couldn't have
spotted it in me.

00:21:06.780 --> 00:21:09.423
And so I think that--
for a lot of you,

00:21:09.423 --> 00:21:12.680
you might have fit David's
pattern more as kids--

00:21:12.680 --> 00:21:15.560
but the fact that I could
cross over that line,

00:21:15.560 --> 00:21:19.160
I think is good news for lots
of people out in the business

00:21:19.160 --> 00:21:20.700
community and beyond.

00:21:20.700 --> 00:21:23.840
Because I wanted to be a
lawyer, for God's sake.

00:21:23.840 --> 00:21:24.810
What was I thinking?

00:21:24.810 --> 00:21:26.140
I'm not sure.

00:21:26.140 --> 00:21:28.380
I got the GMAT,
abandoned that, but got

00:21:28.380 --> 00:21:30.840
an MBA, worked for
an accounting firm,

00:21:30.840 --> 00:21:33.600
worked five years doing
spreadsheets-- first

00:21:33.600 --> 00:21:37.960
by hand, because we didn't have
those computer things, and then

00:21:37.960 --> 00:21:42.760
on the early laptop
machines-- and so

00:21:42.760 --> 00:21:46.760
at age 35, no
indication, right, that I

00:21:46.760 --> 00:21:49.410
was going to have a chance
to have a creative life.

00:21:49.410 --> 00:21:50.460
And so this is good news.

00:21:50.460 --> 00:21:52.450
Because you can decide today.

00:21:52.450 --> 00:21:54.550
You can change later in life.

00:21:54.550 --> 00:21:56.790
And so I just basically
immersed myself

00:21:56.790 --> 00:22:00.120
in the creative
environment at IDEO

00:22:00.120 --> 00:22:03.340
and gained creative
confidence in that process.

00:22:03.340 --> 00:22:05.810
And so, you know, yeah, you
could spot the stuff in David,

00:22:05.810 --> 00:22:11.115
but, yeah, hard to tell
in some of the rest of us.

00:22:11.115 --> 00:22:14.460
FREDERIK G. PFERDT:
So two more questions.

00:22:14.460 --> 00:22:17.350
And then, I want to open
it up for the Googlers

00:22:17.350 --> 00:22:20.230
to ask questions to you.

00:22:20.230 --> 00:22:25.520
The first one is, when you
think about what's next--

00:22:25.520 --> 00:22:27.120
so in the next
five to 10 years--

00:22:27.120 --> 00:22:29.690
I think that's a time
frame we as Googlers think,

00:22:29.690 --> 00:22:32.500
like it's way in the
future, but it's still

00:22:32.500 --> 00:22:35.130
something you can
somehow guess what's

00:22:35.130 --> 00:22:37.540
going on-- so what
are your plans?

00:22:37.540 --> 00:22:39.910
You started a
successful company.

00:22:39.910 --> 00:22:44.590
You started a successful
educational institution.

00:22:44.590 --> 00:22:47.590
You wrote various books
really successfully.

00:22:47.590 --> 00:22:49.035
So what's next?

00:22:49.035 --> 00:22:52.020
TOM KELLEY: You know, I bet
David's got his own answer.

00:22:52.020 --> 00:22:56.230
But for me, this book
is out, and it's done,

00:22:56.230 --> 00:22:57.540
and books are so hard.

00:22:57.540 --> 00:23:00.060
I'm not sure I'm
doing another one.

00:23:00.060 --> 00:23:05.370
So the idea is out
in the world now.

00:23:05.370 --> 00:23:08.600
But I feel like it's got a
pretty long run, this idea

00:23:08.600 --> 00:23:11.969
of creative confidence,
that dealing with the 75%.

00:23:11.969 --> 00:23:13.635
And so I've been
working on innovations,

00:23:13.635 --> 00:23:17.100
you know, the
products, the services,

00:23:17.100 --> 00:23:19.770
the digital experiences
for 30 years.

00:23:19.770 --> 00:23:21.700
And I was thinking,
the next decade

00:23:21.700 --> 00:23:26.460
or so, that I would focus
more, or at least as much,

00:23:26.460 --> 00:23:29.620
on innovators, on inspiring
individuals-- especially

00:23:29.620 --> 00:23:31.120
early in their
careers, because they

00:23:31.120 --> 00:23:34.435
have so much promise
coming up-- to get

00:23:34.435 --> 00:23:36.060
in touch with their
creative confidence

00:23:36.060 --> 00:23:38.910
so they can make a bigger
impact on the world

00:23:38.910 --> 00:23:41.090
and have more fun at work.

00:23:41.090 --> 00:23:42.700
You know, we did
those 100 interviews.

00:23:42.700 --> 00:23:45.790
And it is so much fun to
be around those people who

00:23:45.790 --> 00:23:47.530
have gained creative
confidence basically

00:23:47.530 --> 00:23:49.290
around the fourth
grade, a lot of them.

00:23:49.290 --> 00:23:50.930
And it happens for
kids a lot there.

00:23:50.930 --> 00:23:52.388
They decided they
weren't creative,

00:23:52.388 --> 00:23:55.020
and their world gets smaller
when they make that decision.

00:23:55.020 --> 00:23:57.110
They kind of opt out of stuff.

00:23:57.110 --> 00:23:59.982
And then, everybody we
interviewed, everybody-- and it

00:23:59.982 --> 00:24:01.690
wasn't a random sampling
of the universe.

00:24:01.690 --> 00:24:05.080
We sought them out-- but all
100 of the people we interviewed

00:24:05.080 --> 00:24:08.740
had decided at some point
that they were creative.

00:24:08.740 --> 00:24:13.429
And, wow, just the
look in their eyes.

00:24:13.429 --> 00:24:14.470
They're fun to be around.

00:24:14.470 --> 00:24:17.710
And in the process, it's
stuff isn't even limited

00:24:17.710 --> 00:24:18.490
by creativity.

00:24:18.490 --> 00:24:20.120
They are taking on
bigger challenges.

00:24:20.120 --> 00:24:23.590
They are more resilient
in the face of obstacles,

00:24:23.590 --> 00:24:25.620
more perseverance.

00:24:25.620 --> 00:24:27.360
They're just cool.

00:24:27.360 --> 00:24:29.669
I mean, they're just
fun to be around.

00:24:29.669 --> 00:24:30.460
DAVID KELLEY: Yeah.

00:24:30.460 --> 00:24:32.800
So for me, it's about
scaling this thing.

00:24:32.800 --> 00:24:35.980
So some really interesting
challenges with scaling.

00:24:35.980 --> 00:24:37.820
It seems like scaling
keeps coming up

00:24:37.820 --> 00:24:40.630
as the problem everywhere.

00:24:40.630 --> 00:24:44.250
And for us, even if I
just look at Stanford,

00:24:44.250 --> 00:24:46.869
the university would
like every student

00:24:46.869 --> 00:24:48.410
to have that as a
trait, that they're

00:24:48.410 --> 00:24:49.909
confident in their
creative ability,

00:24:49.909 --> 00:24:52.840
that Stanford is known as
a place where the kids have

00:24:52.840 --> 00:24:55.600
that confidence and they
use that tool all the time.

00:24:55.600 --> 00:24:57.760
Just that alone,
how do you know?

00:25:00.830 --> 00:25:02.300
There's a few
thousand students who

00:25:02.300 --> 00:25:03.800
go through d.school,
maybe, a year--

00:25:03.800 --> 00:25:06.176
but how do you get to
the a large percentage

00:25:06.176 --> 00:25:07.240
of a university?

00:25:07.240 --> 00:25:11.045
And it's the same way
with the relationships

00:25:11.045 --> 00:25:13.690
we have with other outside
universities and stuff.

00:25:13.690 --> 00:25:19.000
And, also, my main focus,
as a kind of a second thing,

00:25:19.000 --> 00:25:21.097
is K-12 education.

00:25:21.097 --> 00:25:22.180
And so we're doing things.

00:25:22.180 --> 00:25:25.410
Like, in Peru, we're
trying to understand

00:25:25.410 --> 00:25:29.360
how to change all of
Peru's educational system

00:25:29.360 --> 00:25:31.120
because it's particularly bad.

00:25:31.120 --> 00:25:33.250
And then, OK, how does
that apply to the US?

00:25:33.250 --> 00:25:34.950
Because the US
thing-- we've been

00:25:34.950 --> 00:25:37.250
working in K-12 for a
while-- and as I told you

00:25:37.250 --> 00:25:39.950
about the brush fire problem-- p
we got a few brush fires going,

00:25:39.950 --> 00:25:42.610
but nothing's that big a deal.

00:25:42.610 --> 00:25:46.827
And so trying to
scale by seeing what

00:25:46.827 --> 00:25:48.410
we can do as the
different experiments

00:25:48.410 --> 00:25:49.950
and then how you scale them.

00:25:49.950 --> 00:25:52.150
And so we're making progress.

00:25:52.150 --> 00:25:54.420
I mean, there's lots
of good news out there.

00:25:54.420 --> 00:25:59.990
But I don't think we've
found that kind of cleverness

00:25:59.990 --> 00:26:02.260
about what makes
something really

00:26:02.260 --> 00:26:05.984
scale, especially in K-12.

00:26:05.984 --> 00:26:08.150
FREDERIK G. PFERDT: So
Googlers in general, I think,

00:26:08.150 --> 00:26:09.630
are really passionate
about working

00:26:09.630 --> 00:26:11.820
on big, audacious goals.

00:26:11.820 --> 00:26:16.910
So what would be one big,
audacious goal or problem

00:26:16.910 --> 00:26:20.690
for you which a lot of people
should actually work on

00:26:20.690 --> 00:26:22.630
in the next three or four years?

00:26:22.630 --> 00:26:25.490
DAVID KELLEY: Well, I
don't know if you know.

00:26:25.490 --> 00:26:27.590
I've been going to TED
for 20 years or so.

00:26:27.590 --> 00:26:31.735
And the biggest, the most
watched TED Talk is Ken

00:26:31.735 --> 00:26:33.350
Robinson's.

00:26:33.350 --> 00:26:39.160
And in that, he said that
he thought in schools,

00:26:39.160 --> 00:26:42.530
creativity was as
important as literacy.

00:26:42.530 --> 00:26:44.850
And we're a long way
from believing that.

00:26:44.850 --> 00:26:52.150
But I really think that through
technology and through doing

00:26:52.150 --> 00:26:55.370
things like project-based
learning and stuff,

00:26:55.370 --> 00:26:57.200
I think that's the
audacious goal.

00:27:01.199 --> 00:27:02.740
I mean, there's
plenty of other ones.

00:27:02.740 --> 00:27:08.070
But from my perspective,
or from our perspective,

00:27:08.070 --> 00:27:09.860
and the same thing at
Stanford, how do you

00:27:09.860 --> 00:27:13.840
get creative confidence into as
many kids as you possibly can?

00:27:13.840 --> 00:27:17.450
Because when we do
succeed, you just

00:27:17.450 --> 00:27:19.510
see how it's transformative.

00:27:19.510 --> 00:27:22.850
TOM KELLY: Yeah, and for
me I would say the big goal

00:27:22.850 --> 00:27:24.890
would be cracking the
code on behavior change.

00:27:24.890 --> 00:27:27.749
You know, so much of what we
do, all of our social innovation

00:27:27.749 --> 00:27:29.790
work, and even our work
in health care and things

00:27:29.790 --> 00:27:32.000
like that, we're trying
to change behavior

00:27:32.000 --> 00:27:34.180
of the constituents
that matter to us.

00:27:34.180 --> 00:27:35.842
They're not always
customers, even.

00:27:35.842 --> 00:27:36.800
And that's really hard.

00:27:36.800 --> 00:27:38.500
People cling to
their old patterns

00:27:38.500 --> 00:27:42.430
even when their old patterns
aren't the best for them.

00:27:42.430 --> 00:27:44.600
And so, for example,
I did a work

00:27:44.600 --> 00:27:46.320
with the water in
developing countries.

00:27:46.320 --> 00:27:48.430
We're in India
trying to get people

00:27:48.430 --> 00:27:50.890
to drink the safe water,
the filtered water,

00:27:50.890 --> 00:27:53.620
the water that won't
make them sick.

00:27:53.620 --> 00:27:57.200
But they've been drinking that
other water for generations.

00:27:57.200 --> 00:28:01.610
And so the old way to do that,
the attempted behavior change

00:28:01.610 --> 00:28:04.790
approach to that, is you send a
social worker into the village,

00:28:04.790 --> 00:28:06.775
and they talk about the
germ theory of disease,

00:28:06.775 --> 00:28:08.520
you know, fascinating
stuff, right?

00:28:08.520 --> 00:28:11.080
And they're explaining
why you shouldn't really

00:28:11.080 --> 00:28:13.270
drink that water from the
well, at least untreated.

00:28:13.270 --> 00:28:16.090
You should get this other
water, which is not free, right?

00:28:16.090 --> 00:28:18.180
Now, we're talking
about families

00:28:18.180 --> 00:28:22.000
for whom any new expense means
trading off something else.

00:28:22.000 --> 00:28:24.400
They're living very
close to the Earth.

00:28:24.400 --> 00:28:28.760
And so they'll be there, really,
with their best interests

00:28:28.760 --> 00:28:31.720
at heart, trying to
convince this community

00:28:31.720 --> 00:28:33.450
to go for the safe water.

00:28:33.450 --> 00:28:35.130
And then, someone
will raise their hand.

00:28:35.130 --> 00:28:36.796
And apparently it
happens a fair amount.

00:28:36.796 --> 00:28:39.100
Someone will raise their
hand and says something like,

00:28:39.100 --> 00:28:44.180
well, you know, my mother
gave me water from that well.

00:28:44.180 --> 00:28:46.650
You're not saying my
mom is wrong, are you?

00:28:46.650 --> 00:28:49.482
And if you're that social worker
in that little village in India

00:28:49.482 --> 00:28:50.940
and that question
comes up, I would

00:28:50.940 --> 00:28:53.040
urge you to just
leave immediately.

00:28:53.040 --> 00:28:55.300
There is no beating
that question.

00:28:55.300 --> 00:28:56.825
You're not going
to change behavior

00:28:56.825 --> 00:29:00.072
in that village that day.

00:29:00.072 --> 00:29:01.530
Because we're very
conscious, we're

00:29:01.530 --> 00:29:02.988
hiring behavioral
economists, we're

00:29:02.988 --> 00:29:05.550
very interested in this
behavior change, what

00:29:05.550 --> 00:29:08.722
we do is we show up in the
village with our own generator,

00:29:08.722 --> 00:29:10.430
because you can't
trust the power supply,

00:29:10.430 --> 00:29:14.170
and a projector and a white
sheet that becomes our screen.

00:29:14.170 --> 00:29:15.920
And during the day,
we hand out pamphlets.

00:29:15.920 --> 00:29:18.480
And then we start with singing
and dancing, because you know,

00:29:18.480 --> 00:29:20.580
if you advertise germ
theory of disease,

00:29:20.580 --> 00:29:22.210
not everybody shows up, right?

00:29:22.210 --> 00:29:25.020
And so singing and
dancing, we've got a crowd.

00:29:25.020 --> 00:29:26.896
And then, with the crowd
assembled-- and it's

00:29:26.896 --> 00:29:28.895
pretty much the whole
village, because what else

00:29:28.895 --> 00:29:30.320
is going on that
night, right, you

00:29:30.320 --> 00:29:32.830
know, they're not watching
reruns of anything,

00:29:32.830 --> 00:29:35.665
because there's no
TVs, right, and so we

00:29:35.665 --> 00:29:37.790
got the attention of the
whole village-- we hook up

00:29:37.790 --> 00:29:40.790
a microscope to that projector.

00:29:40.790 --> 00:29:43.630
And we show them a
drop of the water

00:29:43.630 --> 00:29:46.157
they've been drinking
for generations.

00:29:46.157 --> 00:29:47.740
And we don't have
to check in advance.

00:29:47.740 --> 00:29:49.470
It is alive with small animals.

00:29:49.470 --> 00:29:56.050
It is really scary to see
your filthy water in that way.

00:29:56.050 --> 00:29:58.780
And then, we go to some local
supplier of the safe water,

00:29:58.780 --> 00:30:00.290
and we put a drop of that on it.

00:30:00.290 --> 00:30:01.390
And it's not always
perfect, by the way.

00:30:01.390 --> 00:30:03.098
But it's always way,
way better than this

00:30:03.098 --> 00:30:05.460
really scary looking
water with the animals

00:30:05.460 --> 00:30:07.304
in it, very small animals.

00:30:07.304 --> 00:30:08.845
And then we ask a
different question.

00:30:08.845 --> 00:30:12.300
And the behavioral economists
call this choice architecture,

00:30:12.300 --> 00:30:15.540
which is the ability to
frame the question in a way

00:30:15.540 --> 00:30:17.815
that people make answers
that are true to their belief

00:30:17.815 --> 00:30:18.315
system.

00:30:18.315 --> 00:30:22.130
And so now they've
seen the unsafe water.

00:30:22.130 --> 00:30:24.030
They've seen the safe water.

00:30:24.030 --> 00:30:26.560
And we say, never mind your mom.

00:30:26.560 --> 00:30:27.940
Your mom did the best she could.

00:30:27.940 --> 00:30:29.570
We address them as parents.

00:30:29.570 --> 00:30:33.160
And we say, OK, now that
you have seen it, now

00:30:33.160 --> 00:30:37.600
that you have seen the water
in this new way, which water

00:30:37.600 --> 00:30:39.720
do you want your
children to drink?

00:30:39.720 --> 00:30:42.530
And if you can frame that
question in that way,

00:30:42.530 --> 00:30:44.180
people will change.

00:30:44.180 --> 00:30:46.550
People will give up a
little something else

00:30:46.550 --> 00:30:49.180
in order to have the safe
water for their families.

00:30:49.180 --> 00:30:53.100
And so to do that with
diet and exercise,

00:30:53.100 --> 00:30:55.990
to do that with
planning for retirement

00:30:55.990 --> 00:31:01.110
or saving for college or the
thousand other things, energy

00:31:01.110 --> 00:31:03.750
usage, or recycling,
or other things,

00:31:03.750 --> 00:31:07.607
that's a big thing
to crack the code on.

00:31:07.607 --> 00:31:08.690
FREDERIK G. PFERDT: Right.

00:31:08.690 --> 00:31:09.190
Thank you.

00:31:09.190 --> 00:31:11.830
So we have a
microphone over here.

00:31:11.830 --> 00:31:13.590
If you want to please
start lining up

00:31:13.590 --> 00:31:17.830
and ask your questions.

00:31:17.830 --> 00:31:18.500
AUDIENCE: Hi.

00:31:18.500 --> 00:31:19.546
FREDERIK G. PFERDT: Yes.

00:31:19.546 --> 00:31:21.130
AUDIENCE: So I have a
question that's actually

00:31:21.130 --> 00:31:22.840
kind of on the opposite
end of the spectrum of what

00:31:22.840 --> 00:31:24.260
you've been talking about.

00:31:24.260 --> 00:31:26.540
And that's being overwhelmed
by the opportunity

00:31:26.540 --> 00:31:30.040
to be creative and
come up with ideas.

00:31:30.040 --> 00:31:31.540
I think I speak for
a lot of people.

00:31:31.540 --> 00:31:32.900
Perhaps I've just
been fortunate.

00:31:32.900 --> 00:31:34.566
But in my role and
experience at Google,

00:31:34.566 --> 00:31:37.050
I've been a lot of
situations where

00:31:37.050 --> 00:31:39.240
there's support for
creativity and the opportunity

00:31:39.240 --> 00:31:44.480
to create ideas creates just
an overwhelming set of options.

00:31:44.480 --> 00:31:48.400
And teams can just
spin and spin and spin

00:31:48.400 --> 00:31:51.570
coming up with ideas,
all of them great.

00:31:51.570 --> 00:31:54.650
But you run out of time and
even energy to reduce them

00:31:54.650 --> 00:31:58.560
to actual practicing get things
done from that perspective.

00:31:58.560 --> 00:32:00.290
So curious as to
what your experience

00:32:00.290 --> 00:32:03.140
in a place like the
d.school, where likely there

00:32:03.140 --> 00:32:05.610
is a lot of that going on,
is how do you stop that,

00:32:05.610 --> 00:32:10.050
and how do you just move forward
with an idea or a select set

00:32:10.050 --> 00:32:11.830
of ideas and get them working?

00:32:11.830 --> 00:32:12.580
TOM KELLEY: Right.

00:32:12.580 --> 00:32:16.360
So I totally believe you that
that's a problem at Google.

00:32:16.360 --> 00:32:19.010
And I'm going to go
on record and say

00:32:19.010 --> 00:32:22.400
in the other 99.9% of
client organizations I work

00:32:22.400 --> 00:32:24.820
with, this is not their problem.

00:32:24.820 --> 00:32:27.870
But nevertheless,
you have this issue.

00:32:27.870 --> 00:32:30.580
And so what we would
recommend in a situation

00:32:30.580 --> 00:32:34.200
like that is find the
quickest, cheapest way you

00:32:34.200 --> 00:32:37.720
can prototype the
alternative ideas.

00:32:37.720 --> 00:32:39.880
Because in the
prototype, you kind of

00:32:39.880 --> 00:32:41.740
bring them to life
a little more,

00:32:41.740 --> 00:32:45.680
so that it gets just a
little more tangible in a way

00:32:45.680 --> 00:32:48.706
that reasonable people-- that
would be customers, maybe--

00:32:48.706 --> 00:32:51.080
could look at it and say, oh,
I would totally go for that

00:32:51.080 --> 00:32:53.880
or, like, oh, no, I would
never use that, right?

00:32:53.880 --> 00:32:58.700
And so if you have
lots of ideas but you

00:32:58.700 --> 00:33:02.320
can prototype them all up
to a level in which you

00:33:02.320 --> 00:33:07.190
can get good feedback from
it, then the kind of winners

00:33:07.190 --> 00:33:08.640
will start to emerge.

00:33:08.640 --> 00:33:10.320
DAVID KELLEY: And
you probably do that.

00:33:10.320 --> 00:33:16.070
But the thing has
to do with empathy.

00:33:16.070 --> 00:33:20.960
We really believe that
even at Google, you're

00:33:20.960 --> 00:33:22.900
not deep enough
involved with the people

00:33:22.900 --> 00:33:28.336
that you're trying
to make raving fans.

00:33:28.336 --> 00:33:29.960
I mean, my experience
at the d.school--

00:33:29.960 --> 00:33:30.810
you asked about the d.school.

00:33:30.810 --> 00:33:33.030
I can tell you-- yeah,
there's tons of ideas.

00:33:33.030 --> 00:33:34.700
There's so many ideas.

00:33:34.700 --> 00:33:38.110
But we just keep going
deeper and deeper

00:33:38.110 --> 00:33:40.530
with the people we care
about, with the extreme users,

00:33:40.530 --> 00:33:43.140
with the central
personas, the stuff.

00:33:43.140 --> 00:33:48.260
And it just seems that they
just more quickly resonate

00:33:48.260 --> 00:33:50.130
with some things than
they do the others.

00:33:50.130 --> 00:33:55.290
And then, in this
prototyping way,

00:33:55.290 --> 00:33:57.672
like you take the
pulse news reader

00:33:57.672 --> 00:33:59.880
or whatever, what those guys
did it at the d.school--

00:33:59.880 --> 00:34:03.950
it's like the users will
take you in the right place.

00:34:03.950 --> 00:34:06.610
I mean, you're trying
to go to a really

00:34:06.610 --> 00:34:09.739
special place with
a group of people.

00:34:09.739 --> 00:34:15.320
And we at the d.school
just double down

00:34:15.320 --> 00:34:17.179
on trying to
understand them more.

00:34:17.179 --> 00:34:19.280
Because we have a
tendency to go back

00:34:19.280 --> 00:34:21.239
to our offices or our
teams and sit around

00:34:21.239 --> 00:34:22.690
and talk to each other.

00:34:22.690 --> 00:34:28.210
And so by being out there in
the messiness of people where

00:34:28.210 --> 00:34:29.630
they're going to
use this it seems

00:34:29.630 --> 00:34:31.159
like is the only
thing we really have.

00:34:31.159 --> 00:34:33.742
TOM KELLEY: We're doing a lot
of work with open innovation out

00:34:33.742 --> 00:34:34.930
in the world.

00:34:34.930 --> 00:34:35.980
It's called OpenIDEO.

00:34:35.980 --> 00:34:37.000
The current
challenge is actually

00:34:37.000 --> 00:34:38.150
about creative confidence.

00:34:38.150 --> 00:34:39.840
But we'll ask a question.

00:34:39.840 --> 00:34:41.097
People submit ideas.

00:34:41.097 --> 00:34:42.180
And then they participate.

00:34:42.180 --> 00:34:45.230
The open innovation
community participates,

00:34:45.230 --> 00:34:47.010
in evaluating the ideas.

00:34:47.010 --> 00:34:49.370
And we've now worked
with companies.

00:34:49.370 --> 00:34:52.949
There's other people unrelated
to us doing this internally,

00:34:52.949 --> 00:34:54.810
where it's open
innovation, but it's

00:34:54.810 --> 00:35:00.640
only open within the company in
which the collective community

00:35:00.640 --> 00:35:04.570
of the company judges and says,
wow, we really like this idea.

00:35:04.570 --> 00:35:08.450
So you've got more than
just what your boss likes.

00:35:08.450 --> 00:35:11.090
You've got what the
whole community believes

00:35:11.090 --> 00:35:13.884
has value for the future.

00:35:13.884 --> 00:35:15.300
AUDIENCE: I was
just going to ask,

00:35:15.300 --> 00:35:17.150
I think in "The Ten
Faces of Innovation"

00:35:17.150 --> 00:35:19.060
you discussed the
group of, I think,

00:35:19.060 --> 00:35:21.860
it was fifth graders that you
worked with, or five-year-olds.

00:35:21.860 --> 00:35:23.470
I forget what the number was.

00:35:23.470 --> 00:35:25.720
I was just wondering how
that's been going since then,

00:35:25.720 --> 00:35:27.366
if that's something
you guys still use?

00:35:27.366 --> 00:35:29.940
TOM KELLEY: So this is a
question about an old book.

00:35:29.940 --> 00:35:31.900
Fifth graders we worked with.

00:35:31.900 --> 00:35:32.520
Don't know.

00:35:32.520 --> 00:35:36.780
But that prompts a story,
which is one of the favorites.

00:35:36.780 --> 00:35:38.390
Of the 100 people
we interviewed,

00:35:38.390 --> 00:35:41.420
there's this teacher,
teaches the fifth grade.

00:35:41.420 --> 00:35:42.750
Her name is Marcy Barton.

00:35:42.750 --> 00:35:47.920
And she has been
teaching for 42 years.

00:35:47.920 --> 00:35:51.680
And so I'm sure you've had those
kind of teachers, 42 years in.

00:35:51.680 --> 00:35:54.560
They developed their
syllabus 41 years ago.

00:35:54.560 --> 00:35:57.180
And they've been in full
implementation/repetition mode

00:35:57.180 --> 00:35:57.810
ever since.

00:35:57.810 --> 00:36:00.110
And that doesn't
quite describe Marcy.

00:36:00.110 --> 00:36:03.980
So Marcy comes to the d.school.

00:36:03.980 --> 00:36:08.030
She comes to a two-day
program for educators.

00:36:08.030 --> 00:36:09.661
And by the way, I
am going to sound

00:36:09.661 --> 00:36:11.410
like a paid spokesperson
for the d.school.

00:36:11.410 --> 00:36:12.660
I'm not a Stanford guy at all.

00:36:12.660 --> 00:36:15.120
I'm a Berkeley guy, right?

00:36:15.120 --> 00:36:17.340
But Marcy is an amazing person.

00:36:17.340 --> 00:36:20.120
She comes to the d.school
for this two-day program.

00:36:20.120 --> 00:36:25.010
And based on that two days,
she basically changes her life.

00:36:25.010 --> 00:36:29.450
She reinvents her
curriculum from scratch

00:36:29.450 --> 00:36:32.200
after that two-day seminar.

00:36:32.200 --> 00:36:36.180
And she does all project-based
learning with her kids now.

00:36:36.180 --> 00:36:38.400
And so instead of
standing at the board

00:36:38.400 --> 00:36:41.810
and talking about
immigration in the New World,

00:36:41.810 --> 00:36:45.150
she turns the desks upside
down and puts the kids inside

00:36:45.150 --> 00:36:46.560
and wraps it with craft paper.

00:36:46.560 --> 00:36:47.580
And now they're in
they're in the ship going

00:36:47.580 --> 00:36:48.550
go into the New World.

00:36:48.550 --> 00:36:50.050
And they write
their constitution

00:36:50.050 --> 00:36:51.200
while they're in the ship.

00:36:51.200 --> 00:36:53.575
And then, when they get there,
they use their math skills

00:36:53.575 --> 00:36:55.850
and make a perfect scale
model of the community.

00:36:55.850 --> 00:36:57.980
And everything is a project.

00:36:57.980 --> 00:37:02.440
And her kids have
done remarkably well.

00:37:02.440 --> 00:37:05.510
And Marcy, at one
point in the interview,

00:37:05.510 --> 00:37:08.590
she says, my kids are
wonderfully more creative

00:37:08.590 --> 00:37:09.560
and they're engaged.

00:37:09.560 --> 00:37:12.922
And she says, and
write this down.

00:37:12.922 --> 00:37:15.130
And I'm thinking, Marcy,
we're taping this interview.

00:37:15.130 --> 00:37:17.190
But anyhow, she still
wants us to write.

00:37:17.190 --> 00:37:19.270
And she says, and
tell those parents,

00:37:19.270 --> 00:37:21.832
my kids do better on the
standardized tests, too.

00:37:21.832 --> 00:37:23.290
She says, of course,
they do better

00:37:23.290 --> 00:37:24.373
on the standardized tests.

00:37:24.373 --> 00:37:27.150
She says, my kids are
engaged every single day

00:37:27.150 --> 00:37:29.100
of the school year.

00:37:29.100 --> 00:37:31.860
And so Marcy says,
in the interview,

00:37:31.860 --> 00:37:34.710
this design thinking stuff
she picked up at the d.school,

00:37:34.710 --> 00:37:36.700
she says, this is
the cornerstone

00:37:36.700 --> 00:37:39.400
of my career and my life.

00:37:39.400 --> 00:37:40.680
And so that's Marcy story.

00:37:40.680 --> 00:37:43.540
But it's so ridiculously
unbelievable

00:37:43.540 --> 00:37:47.640
that David and I had to take
three steps back and think, OK,

00:37:47.640 --> 00:37:50.210
how are we going to
explain this to anybody?

00:37:50.210 --> 00:37:52.070
So here's our theory.

00:37:52.070 --> 00:37:54.760
There's an old saying, sometimes
attributed to Plutarch,

00:37:54.760 --> 00:37:56.760
but there's another
possible source for it,

00:37:56.760 --> 00:38:00.490
where someone once said
that education is not

00:38:00.490 --> 00:38:02.240
the filling of a vessel,
it's the lighting

00:38:02.240 --> 00:38:06.030
of a fire, which is
not entirely true.

00:38:06.030 --> 00:38:08.480
Because in the
airline magazine, when

00:38:08.480 --> 00:38:12.980
it says you can learn Mandarin
in five days, that is bull.

00:38:12.980 --> 00:38:15.075
You cannot learn
Mandarin in five days.

00:38:15.075 --> 00:38:15.700
And here's why.

00:38:15.700 --> 00:38:17.590
Because it's the
filling of a vessel.

00:38:17.590 --> 00:38:18.889
It's vocabulary.

00:38:18.889 --> 00:38:19.430
It's grammar.

00:38:19.430 --> 00:38:20.200
It's tonality.

00:38:20.200 --> 00:38:22.690
It's really, really hard.

00:38:22.690 --> 00:38:26.780
But with Marcy, at the d.school,
she didn't fill any vessels.

00:38:26.780 --> 00:38:28.180
She lit a fire.

00:38:28.180 --> 00:38:31.380
She had almost everything
she needed and just

00:38:31.380 --> 00:38:34.910
had this one more spark
that set it all off.

00:38:34.910 --> 00:38:39.040
And so, anyhow, my favorite
fifth grade teacher

00:38:39.040 --> 00:38:44.370
in the world now, even though
we met fairly recently.

00:38:44.370 --> 00:38:46.772
DAVID KELLEY: Yeah, I'll
talk to five-year-olds.

00:38:46.772 --> 00:38:48.980
Because he didn't know if
it was five or fifth grade,

00:38:48.980 --> 00:38:49.896
so he did fifth grade.

00:38:49.896 --> 00:38:51.160
I'll talk to five-year-olds.

00:38:51.160 --> 00:38:52.940
So one of the things
we really found out,

00:38:52.940 --> 00:38:56.570
that was really interesting,
is that teachers never

00:38:56.570 --> 00:38:58.400
have time to give
the same problem,

00:38:58.400 --> 00:39:00.220
even if they're
project-based learning,

00:39:00.220 --> 00:39:02.595
they don't have time to give
the same problem over again.

00:39:02.595 --> 00:39:04.810
And It turns out that
there's so much learning

00:39:04.810 --> 00:39:07.520
in becoming expert in
doing the same project over

00:39:07.520 --> 00:39:08.800
and over again.

00:39:08.800 --> 00:39:10.440
So you give them the project.

00:39:10.440 --> 00:39:13.880
And then everybody in the class
comes up with their ideas.

00:39:13.880 --> 00:39:17.520
And then you've learned so
much, you become more expert.

00:39:17.520 --> 00:39:19.859
Because you have your ideas,
and you've worked on it.

00:39:19.859 --> 00:39:22.150
And then, you have all of
the other ideas or something,

00:39:22.150 --> 00:39:23.192
and then you do it again.

00:39:23.192 --> 00:39:24.358
So we've been experimenting.

00:39:24.358 --> 00:39:26.640
We experimented with that,
where the same project is

00:39:26.640 --> 00:39:28.000
given three times.

00:39:28.000 --> 00:39:33.040
And so I'll just tell you my
favorite kindergarten class.

00:39:33.040 --> 00:39:37.510
And the problem we give them
is redesigning your bedroom.

00:39:37.510 --> 00:39:39.150
Fairly vigorous, anyway.

00:39:39.150 --> 00:39:40.859
So everybody comes back.

00:39:40.859 --> 00:39:41.650
And they come back.

00:39:41.650 --> 00:39:43.150
And they've got
their little models.

00:39:43.150 --> 00:39:45.860
And they're made out of
pipe cleaners and pieces

00:39:45.860 --> 00:39:47.524
of cardboard and stuff.

00:39:47.524 --> 00:39:48.940
I want to make a
long story short.

00:39:48.940 --> 00:39:51.982
This one little
girl has the design.

00:39:51.982 --> 00:39:52.940
They said, what's this?

00:39:52.940 --> 00:39:54.231
And she says, well, here is it.

00:39:54.231 --> 00:39:56.470
So we had them do need
finding and all this stuff.

00:39:56.470 --> 00:39:57.270
And she'd gone out.

00:39:57.270 --> 00:40:02.160
And her bedroom had a
place for the family car

00:40:02.160 --> 00:40:03.730
to pull next to her bed.

00:40:03.730 --> 00:40:07.470
Because her need was, when
we come home late at night

00:40:07.470 --> 00:40:10.970
and I'm asleep, Dad has to carry
me all the way from the garage

00:40:10.970 --> 00:40:11.840
into the bed.

00:40:11.840 --> 00:40:14.007
So in her design,
the door to the car

00:40:14.007 --> 00:40:16.090
opens-- she had a little
thing-- and she rolls out

00:40:16.090 --> 00:40:18.180
right out of the car
into the bed, right?

00:40:18.180 --> 00:40:18.680
[LAUGHTER]

00:40:18.680 --> 00:40:21.130
DAVID KELLEY: Anyway, so then
we do another round, another

00:40:21.130 --> 00:40:21.630
around.

00:40:21.630 --> 00:40:24.200
And by the end,
every kid-- that's

00:40:24.200 --> 00:40:26.430
the killer app, right--
every kid's thing

00:40:26.430 --> 00:40:30.640
has a place for the car to park
next to their particular bed.

00:40:30.640 --> 00:40:32.367
[LAUGHTER]

00:40:32.367 --> 00:40:33.450
FREDERIK G. PFERDT: Great.

00:40:33.450 --> 00:40:34.330
More questions?

00:40:34.330 --> 00:40:35.310
AUDIENCE: Was there
any difference

00:40:35.310 --> 00:40:37.601
when you did the survey across
the different countries,

00:40:37.601 --> 00:40:39.230
or that survey
you had mentioned,

00:40:39.230 --> 00:40:43.465
in terms of culturally whether
the US or any one country

00:40:43.465 --> 00:40:45.590
is really behind or
really ahead and what

00:40:45.590 --> 00:40:46.080
the driver may have been?

00:40:46.080 --> 00:40:46.788
TOM KELLEY: Sure.

00:40:46.788 --> 00:40:48.640
You gotta look at
the whole survey.

00:40:48.640 --> 00:40:50.620
I was interested in
the overall response.

00:40:50.620 --> 00:40:52.870
But when you look at the
individual country responses,

00:40:52.870 --> 00:40:53.870
it's fascinating.

00:40:53.870 --> 00:40:56.190
Because, basically,
every country

00:40:56.190 --> 00:40:58.700
thinks that they are the most
creative country in the world,

00:40:58.700 --> 00:41:00.980
right, though no one
else thinks they are.

00:41:00.980 --> 00:41:03.210
But the exception
to that is Japan.

00:41:03.210 --> 00:41:05.670
Everybody thinks that
Japan is creative

00:41:05.670 --> 00:41:07.510
except Japanese people.

00:41:07.510 --> 00:41:11.920
And so there's just this weird
kind of asymmetry to the belief

00:41:11.920 --> 00:41:15.650
systems from country to country.

00:41:15.650 --> 00:41:18.201
But that gets at this very
central theme in our book,

00:41:18.201 --> 00:41:19.700
which is that
creative confidence is

00:41:19.700 --> 00:41:23.400
the combination of
the natural ability

00:41:23.400 --> 00:41:25.780
to come up with breakthrough
ideas and the courage

00:41:25.780 --> 00:41:27.370
to act on them.

00:41:27.370 --> 00:41:29.820
And so I've spent a ton
of my life in Japan.

00:41:29.820 --> 00:41:32.860
I think it's a tremendously
creative country.

00:41:32.860 --> 00:41:37.600
And sometimes, in
modern Japan, people

00:41:37.600 --> 00:41:39.540
don't have the courage
to stand up and say,

00:41:39.540 --> 00:41:40.990
this is a good idea.

00:41:40.990 --> 00:41:43.080
They feel like they
have to self-edit,

00:41:43.080 --> 00:41:45.200
they can't express
their creativity.

00:41:45.200 --> 00:41:46.980
And so, I think, a
huge opportunity there.

00:41:46.980 --> 00:41:48.710
But, yeah, country
by country, it's

00:41:48.710 --> 00:41:50.370
quite interesting
to see how they

00:41:50.370 --> 00:41:53.940
see themselves so differently
than other countries see them.

00:41:53.940 --> 00:41:58.300
DAVID KELLEY: And we do user
research all over the world

00:41:58.300 --> 00:41:58.800
constantly.

00:41:58.800 --> 00:42:04.740
And I mean, people
are completely

00:42:04.740 --> 00:42:07.880
different in their desires.

00:42:07.880 --> 00:42:08.950
So I remember.

00:42:08.950 --> 00:42:10.730
a vacuum cleaner
company asked us

00:42:10.730 --> 00:42:13.030
to design a world
vacuum cleaner,

00:42:13.030 --> 00:42:15.839
like one vacuum cleaner that
they could sell everywhere

00:42:15.839 --> 00:42:16.380
in the world.

00:42:16.380 --> 00:42:21.450
And it was hilarious, because
you go around and talk

00:42:21.450 --> 00:42:22.950
to people about
vacuum cleaners, you

00:42:22.950 --> 00:42:25.440
realize just how different
the cultures are.

00:42:25.440 --> 00:42:27.447
You know, there
are places in Asia

00:42:27.447 --> 00:42:29.780
where they wanted a really
technical vacuum cleaner that

00:42:29.780 --> 00:42:33.540
counted dust mites and was
quiet and small and stuff.

00:42:33.540 --> 00:42:37.370
And people in the United States
want some big piece of metal

00:42:37.370 --> 00:42:39.700
that makes a loud
sucking noise, right?

00:42:39.700 --> 00:42:43.230
And so it was not possible to
do a world product, at least

00:42:43.230 --> 00:42:44.420
in this, physical things.

00:42:44.420 --> 00:42:48.035
You guys have a
better chance of that.

00:42:48.035 --> 00:42:51.000
AUDIENCE: Have you
guys had any instances

00:42:51.000 --> 00:42:54.500
where the design approach
didn't work or it failed?

00:42:54.500 --> 00:42:56.842
And then, what did
you guys do about it?

00:42:56.842 --> 00:42:57.550
TOM KELLEY: Sure.

00:42:57.550 --> 00:42:58.425
Have we had failures?

00:42:58.425 --> 00:43:00.380
Yeah, you bet we have.

00:43:00.380 --> 00:43:02.350
I mean, this is the
essence of our approach.

00:43:02.350 --> 00:43:04.460
If you're not
failing, wow, you're

00:43:04.460 --> 00:43:05.770
just not taking any risks.

00:43:05.770 --> 00:43:07.210
It's like, I want
to learn to ski,

00:43:07.210 --> 00:43:09.500
but I never want to
fall down, right?

00:43:09.500 --> 00:43:11.030
Good luck with that.

00:43:11.030 --> 00:43:13.810
And so lots of
failures along the way.

00:43:13.810 --> 00:43:16.590
We were just doing a social
innovation project in Ghana

00:43:16.590 --> 00:43:19.480
that had to do with,
let's just call it,

00:43:19.480 --> 00:43:22.530
sanitation issues so as not
to turn off the whole crowd.

00:43:22.530 --> 00:43:25.820
But anyhow, the sanitation issue
is public sanitation issues.

00:43:25.820 --> 00:43:29.030
And we had this idea
that we'd put up signs

00:43:29.030 --> 00:43:32.830
all over the
community and that we

00:43:32.830 --> 00:43:36.220
would draw maps of where the
big issues were by having people

00:43:36.220 --> 00:43:39.680
call in and say, over there,
there's a problem, over there.

00:43:39.680 --> 00:43:44.330
And so we put these signs up
all over the community, call in.

00:43:44.330 --> 00:43:47.460
And we got zero phone calls.

00:43:47.460 --> 00:43:50.140
I mean, well, in
fact, the phone rang.

00:43:50.140 --> 00:43:51.740
But nobody was ever there.

00:43:51.740 --> 00:43:53.190
It's like, what the heck?

00:43:53.190 --> 00:43:57.080
I mean, how are we going to
get data this way, right?

00:43:57.080 --> 00:43:59.440
And then, we were outsiders.

00:43:59.440 --> 00:44:01.150
We didn't fully understand.

00:44:01.150 --> 00:44:04.100
We hadn't done all of
the design research

00:44:04.100 --> 00:44:07.150
we needed to understand the
community we were working in.

00:44:07.150 --> 00:44:08.850
And it turns out--
I guess, this is

00:44:08.850 --> 00:44:12.280
true in many parts of
Africa-- an incoming phone

00:44:12.280 --> 00:44:14.970
call on your cellphone is free.

00:44:14.970 --> 00:44:18.430
An outgoing phone call is
the one you pay for, right?

00:44:18.430 --> 00:44:21.940
So nobody is going to
pay for a phone call

00:44:21.940 --> 00:44:24.320
to tell you about
sanitation issues.

00:44:24.320 --> 00:44:26.920
And so there is this
practice very common

00:44:26.920 --> 00:44:29.390
in that part of the
world called flashing.

00:44:29.390 --> 00:44:32.220
And flashing is when you
call someone just enough

00:44:32.220 --> 00:44:35.840
to make their phone ring and
record your caller ID number,

00:44:35.840 --> 00:44:36.770
and then you hang up.

00:44:36.770 --> 00:44:38.820
And if they want to talk
to you-- in other words,

00:44:38.820 --> 00:44:41.246
if they want to pay
for the phone call--

00:44:41.246 --> 00:44:42.370
then they'll call you back.

00:44:42.370 --> 00:44:45.050
And so we went and changed all
of the signs all over and said,

00:44:45.050 --> 00:44:47.140
don't call this number,
flash this number.

00:44:47.140 --> 00:44:49.100
And then, we got all
kinds of data, right?

00:44:49.100 --> 00:44:51.174
But shame on us for not
having figured it out.

00:44:51.174 --> 00:44:53.090
I mean, we could have
printed those signs once

00:44:53.090 --> 00:44:54.660
instead of twice.

00:44:54.660 --> 00:45:00.170
But we were naive just as that
outsider in the Indian village

00:45:00.170 --> 00:45:03.010
didn't fully understand
all of the things that

00:45:03.010 --> 00:45:05.700
were making those
family decisions.

00:45:05.700 --> 00:45:07.767
We didn't understand
the local community

00:45:07.767 --> 00:45:09.350
enough to get it
right the first time.

00:45:09.350 --> 00:45:11.349
DAVID KELLEY: Let me go
on record as saying IDEO

00:45:11.349 --> 00:45:13.420
doesn't fail at
the end very often.

00:45:13.420 --> 00:45:15.260
In the beginning,
it's a technique.

00:45:15.260 --> 00:45:15.860
At the end, we tend to--

00:45:15.860 --> 00:45:17.984
TOM KELLEY: Well, there
was that whole phase called

00:45:17.984 --> 00:45:20.520
pen-based computers, many of
you too young to remember.

00:45:20.520 --> 00:45:23.456
But we and all of our
clients failed in that phase.

00:45:23.456 --> 00:45:24.580
Nobody wanted those things.

00:45:24.580 --> 00:45:27.140
DAVID KELLEY: Well, one
of my favorite discussions

00:45:27.140 --> 00:45:30.730
about failure is about one of
my buddies named John Cassidy.

00:45:30.730 --> 00:45:32.679
John Cassidy is a wonderful guy.

00:45:32.679 --> 00:45:33.970
He teaches at the d.school now.

00:45:33.970 --> 00:45:36.330
But he started a company
called Klutz Press.

00:45:36.330 --> 00:45:39.850
You know, Klutz Press is books
that you see in toy stores

00:45:39.850 --> 00:45:40.760
with stuff.

00:45:40.760 --> 00:45:43.530
Well, his first
project was called

00:45:43.530 --> 00:45:46.180
"Juggling for the
Complete Klutz."

00:45:46.180 --> 00:45:48.012
And it's a long story.

00:45:48.012 --> 00:45:49.970
And he thought he was in
the juggling business.

00:45:49.970 --> 00:45:52.040
And he never came out with
a book for five more years.

00:45:52.040 --> 00:45:53.530
But then he figured he
was in the book business,

00:45:53.530 --> 00:45:54.830
and he's done very well.

00:45:54.830 --> 00:45:57.850
But he was in the juggling
business when he started.

00:45:57.850 --> 00:46:01.520
Anyway, I got this book.

00:46:01.520 --> 00:46:03.310
I didn't know Cass at the time.

00:46:03.310 --> 00:46:05.769
But seemed like a good
idea, you know, juggling.

00:46:05.769 --> 00:46:07.810
I could impress the girls
at parties or something

00:46:07.810 --> 00:46:09.740
if I could juggle.

00:46:09.740 --> 00:46:12.680
And so I want to do that.

00:46:12.680 --> 00:46:19.340
Well, the whole first half
of the book is about failing,

00:46:19.340 --> 00:46:23.830
about dropping the
ball on the floor.

00:46:23.830 --> 00:46:24.900
It's called the drop.

00:46:24.900 --> 00:46:27.577
He does nothing in this
book but desensitize you

00:46:27.577 --> 00:46:28.993
to the ball dropping
on the floor.

00:46:28.993 --> 00:46:30.284
He has lots of ways to do that.

00:46:30.284 --> 00:46:34.510
But the ball hitting the
floor is just not a big deal.

00:46:34.510 --> 00:46:37.900
It's not something that your
brain is trying to prevent,

00:46:37.900 --> 00:46:39.770
because it's so normal.

00:46:39.770 --> 00:46:41.990
And so, then, when
that happens, it's

00:46:41.990 --> 00:46:44.240
incredibly easy to
learn how to juggle,

00:46:44.240 --> 00:46:47.550
because it's just not that
mechanically difficult.

00:46:47.550 --> 00:46:49.100
But what's happening
is your brain's

00:46:49.100 --> 00:46:52.250
constantly worried about
or trying to keep you

00:46:52.250 --> 00:46:54.100
from dropping the
ball on the ground.

00:46:54.100 --> 00:46:57.400
And so it's a great example
of how you can get over

00:46:57.400 --> 00:47:00.754
that kind of fear that
you might make a mistake.

00:47:00.754 --> 00:47:02.170
And then you can
accomplish things

00:47:02.170 --> 00:47:03.970
that seem particularly
difficult.

00:47:03.970 --> 00:47:07.050
TOM KELLEY: You know, a great
microculture in the world that

00:47:07.050 --> 00:47:10.800
has got the right attitude about
failure is the gaming culture.

00:47:10.800 --> 00:47:13.240
I mean, you think about
gaming, it's about failure.

00:47:13.240 --> 00:47:15.450
I tell a story in the
book about my son Sean

00:47:15.450 --> 00:47:19.470
who, Christmas Day a few
years back, got the Tony Hawk

00:47:19.470 --> 00:47:21.015
skateboarding game.

00:47:21.015 --> 00:47:22.890
And those of you who
have played it may know,

00:47:22.890 --> 00:47:24.500
it's got a skateboard inside.

00:47:24.500 --> 00:47:26.660
It's got a full-size
skateboard that you stand on.

00:47:26.660 --> 00:47:29.830
And it controls the game.

00:47:29.830 --> 00:47:33.230
And he's there in front of three
generations of Kelleys, right,

00:47:33.230 --> 00:47:34.570
trying out his new game.

00:47:34.570 --> 00:47:38.160
And on-screen, his avatar-- you
know, his character on-screen,

00:47:38.160 --> 00:47:41.280
is smashing into the wall,
like, a couple of hundred times.

00:47:41.280 --> 00:47:43.740
And unlike some
other video games,

00:47:43.740 --> 00:47:47.230
he's also physically falling
off of the skateboard

00:47:47.230 --> 00:47:51.270
and nearly breaking
the glass coffee table

00:47:51.270 --> 00:47:52.530
and stuff like that.

00:47:52.530 --> 00:47:55.260
And I'm sitting there watching
him for, like, half an hour.

00:47:55.260 --> 00:47:58.430
And it suddenly occurs to
me, this is amazing, right?

00:47:58.430 --> 00:48:03.030
I mean, he's got the whole
family watching him fail time

00:48:03.030 --> 00:48:04.740
after time after
time, and he's not

00:48:04.740 --> 00:48:06.650
the tiniest bit embarrassed.

00:48:06.650 --> 00:48:09.420
So how is it that in
the gaming culture,

00:48:09.420 --> 00:48:11.230
you have this what
Jane McGonigal calls

00:48:11.230 --> 00:48:12.270
urgent optimism.

00:48:12.270 --> 00:48:13.600
It's like, OK, that failed.

00:48:13.600 --> 00:48:15.749
Better try again, as
opposed to, in real life,

00:48:15.749 --> 00:48:17.040
where you say, oh, that failed.

00:48:17.040 --> 00:48:18.760
I'm marked for life, right?

00:48:18.760 --> 00:48:20.760
And so, if we can
have a little bit more

00:48:20.760 --> 00:48:23.260
of the gaming culture, the best
parts of the gaming culture,

00:48:23.260 --> 00:48:27.630
out here in the physical world,
that would be a good thing.

00:48:27.630 --> 00:48:28.800
FREDERIK G. PFERDT: Great.

00:48:28.800 --> 00:48:30.670
I think that's a
great note to end on,

00:48:30.670 --> 00:48:32.905
to encourage everybody
over the weekend at least

00:48:32.905 --> 00:48:33.655
to try a game--

00:48:33.655 --> 00:48:34.155
[LAUGHTER]

00:48:34.155 --> 00:48:36.090
FREDERIK G. PFERDT:
--fail a couple of times,

00:48:36.090 --> 00:48:38.150
even if it's juggling.

00:48:38.150 --> 00:48:41.720
We have books which
David and Tom might

00:48:41.720 --> 00:48:44.460
sign the back for
a special price.

00:48:44.460 --> 00:48:45.990
And thanks,
everybody, for coming.

00:48:45.990 --> 00:48:47.170
And have a great weekend.

00:48:47.170 --> 00:48:47.470
[APPLAUSE]

00:48:47.470 --> 00:48:48.386
TOM KELLEY: All right.

00:48:48.386 --> 00:48:49.270
[APPLAUSE]

00:48:49.270 --> 00:49:18.616
[MUSIC PLAYING]
