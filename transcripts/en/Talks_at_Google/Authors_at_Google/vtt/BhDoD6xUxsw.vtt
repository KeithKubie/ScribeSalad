Super excited to have
everyone in attendance

00:00:05.970 --> 00:00:09.280
for this very special day.

00:00:09.280 --> 00:00:11.780
Talks at Google and the
Black Googler Network

00:00:11.780 --> 00:00:17.130
are super excited to be
able to welcome to the stage

00:00:17.130 --> 00:00:20.370
a man that I have
very copious notes

00:00:20.370 --> 00:00:22.670
that I need to refer
to to make sure I hit

00:00:22.670 --> 00:00:25.657
every single awesome accolade.

00:00:25.657 --> 00:00:27.240
I'm still going to
miss a ton of them.

00:00:27.240 --> 00:00:34.625
So welcome to the stage a man
with two decades of experience,

00:00:34.625 --> 00:00:37.790
of impact in the world, and
sharing his thoughts and ideas

00:00:37.790 --> 00:00:44.180
as a poet, hip hop artist,
songwriter and actor.

00:00:44.180 --> 00:00:47.600
He's released six
books and five albums

00:00:47.600 --> 00:00:51.330
and has vaulted himself onto
the list of best selling

00:00:51.330 --> 00:00:52.834
poet of all time.

00:00:52.834 --> 00:00:54.250
I'm not even sure
how you do that,

00:00:54.250 --> 00:00:57.090
but you got to be pretty amazing
to-- to make that happen.

00:00:57.090 --> 00:00:58.390
[LAUGHTER]

00:00:58.390 --> 00:01:02.000
So we're going to have
a lot of fun tonight.

Some of the
performances we're going

00:01:04.069 --> 00:01:06.480
to have are selections
from his book,

00:01:06.480 --> 00:01:10.570
"USA" and his album
"MartyrLoserKing"

00:01:10.570 --> 00:01:13.690
which my personal favorite
is "Think Like the Book Say."

00:01:13.690 --> 00:01:15.880
I've had that on
repeat all week.

00:01:15.880 --> 00:01:17.830
So we might hear
that later tonight.

00:01:17.830 --> 00:01:18.392
We'll see.

00:01:18.392 --> 00:01:19.780

and will be doing three nights
of shows here in Chicago.

00:01:39.830 --> 00:01:42.060
So I'm not sure if
there's any tickets left,

00:01:42.060 --> 00:01:45.390
but you can try and
check those out and see

00:01:45.390 --> 00:01:48.360
what might be still available.

00:01:48.360 --> 00:01:51.110

saying, we are

other than Saul Williams

continuum, the force of gravity,
whether the opposite of gravity

condition or another.

00:05:29.560 --> 00:05:30.765
Good afternoon, everyone.

00:05:30.765 --> 00:05:32.735
[APPLAUSE]

00:05:32.735 --> 00:05:33.568
You want to come up?

00:05:36.320 --> 00:05:40.740
I think that Josh and I decided
we're going to talk a bit

00:05:40.740 --> 00:05:43.920
and intersperse it with a
little bit of performance

00:05:43.920 --> 00:05:44.673
if that's cool?

00:05:44.673 --> 00:05:45.420
AUDIENCE: Yeah, sounds great.

00:05:45.420 --> 00:05:46.150
SAUL WILLIAMS: We'll
keep it moving.

00:05:46.150 --> 00:05:47.930
And maybe it'll
raise new questions.

00:05:47.930 --> 00:05:49.450
And we'll keep moving like that.

00:05:49.450 --> 00:05:51.861
So it's my pleasure
to introduce--

00:05:51.861 --> 00:05:54.266
[LAUGHTER]

00:05:55.230 --> 00:05:57.980
JOSH: Well, I just have to
say, that was really awesome.

00:05:57.980 --> 00:06:00.010
And it's so cool to have
you at Google, Saul.

00:06:00.010 --> 00:06:01.290
SAUL WILLIAMS: Thank you.

00:06:01.290 --> 00:06:03.530
Oh, oh-- OK.

00:06:03.530 --> 00:06:05.320
JOSH: It's excellent.

00:06:05.320 --> 00:06:07.280
So we have questions,
lot of questions--

00:06:07.280 --> 00:06:07.920
SAUL WILLIAMS: All right, cool.

00:06:07.920 --> 00:06:09.990
JOSH: --so many questions we had
to edit them down quite a bit.

00:06:09.990 --> 00:06:10.320
SAUL WILLIAMS: All right.

00:06:10.320 --> 00:06:12.930
JOSH: And I'd say the
first thing is your music,

00:06:12.930 --> 00:06:15.250
your poetry is infused
with social and political

00:06:15.250 --> 00:06:16.634
commentary, like nonstop.

00:06:16.634 --> 00:06:17.425
SAUL WILLIAMS: Mhm.

00:06:17.425 --> 00:06:20.057
JOSH: And technology is such
a massive factor in that.

00:06:20.057 --> 00:06:20.890
SAUL WILLIAMS: Yeah.

00:06:21.710 --> 00:06:25.540
JOSH: What is it about online
culture you find interesting?

00:06:25.540 --> 00:06:28.540
SAUL WILLIAMS: It's just what I
find interesting about culture.

00:06:28.540 --> 00:06:30.750
And art is a
reflection of culture.

00:06:30.750 --> 00:06:35.570
And if I were not-- if my work
did not reflect online culture,

00:06:35.570 --> 00:06:38.410
I don't know if I'd be
significantly reflecting

00:06:38.410 --> 00:06:39.260
culture.

00:06:39.260 --> 00:06:41.580
It's a huge part of who
we are at this point.

00:06:41.580 --> 00:06:46.820
It's a huge part of how we
operate, how we interact.

00:06:46.820 --> 00:06:52.560
And there's a lot of power
yielded through that.

00:06:52.560 --> 00:06:55.290
And then there are
the powers that be.

00:06:55.290 --> 00:06:58.960
And I'm interested in
the intersectionality

00:06:58.960 --> 00:07:03.430
between our individual
power as human beings,

00:07:03.430 --> 00:07:07.024
as communities,
and as individuals

00:07:07.024 --> 00:07:13.950
as is juxtaposed to the powers
and power structures that

00:07:13.950 --> 00:07:24.420
aim to control, diffuse
our movement or movements,

00:07:24.420 --> 00:07:26.110
for that matter.

00:07:26.110 --> 00:07:30.270
So I don't consider
myself an activist.

00:07:30.270 --> 00:07:33.520
I don't consider it a big deal
that my work reflects shit

00:07:33.520 --> 00:07:36.150
that's going on in the world.

00:07:36.150 --> 00:07:39.270
I consider it more
weird that there are so

00:07:39.270 --> 00:07:41.710
many songs about,
like, strip clubs

00:07:41.710 --> 00:07:44.090
as if there's not other
shit going on in the world.

00:07:44.090 --> 00:07:44.890
[LAUGHTER]

00:07:44.890 --> 00:07:47.730
You know, I think
my shit is normal.

00:07:47.730 --> 00:07:50.100
It's just like, OK, here
is an overview of what

00:07:50.100 --> 00:07:51.950
I see going on, you know?

00:07:51.950 --> 00:07:54.256
I don't know why there
aren't more, like, you know,

00:07:54.256 --> 00:07:56.790
Chelsea Manning anthems.

00:07:56.790 --> 00:08:01.620
You know, like, to me it
seems like, yeah, why not?

00:08:01.620 --> 00:08:02.120
So--

00:08:02.120 --> 00:08:02.620
JOSH: Yeah.

00:08:02.620 --> 00:08:06.190
So art is a big channel
for social change.

00:08:06.190 --> 00:08:08.680
So you're saying it is like
you're not seeing much of that.

00:08:08.680 --> 00:08:10.980
SAUL WILLIAMS: Uh, there's
a lot of it happening.

00:08:10.980 --> 00:08:18.540
And I think that, you know,
things move cyclically

00:08:18.540 --> 00:08:21.080
through different
artistic journalists.

00:08:21.080 --> 00:08:24.340
So that for example, you know,
if this were the '70s, maybe

00:08:24.340 --> 00:08:26.250
we'd be talking about film.

00:08:26.250 --> 00:08:29.590
And in the '90s, we'd be
talking about independent film.

00:08:29.590 --> 00:08:31.770
And today, we're
talking about series.

00:08:31.770 --> 00:08:33.890
And there's a huge
movement in visual arts

00:08:33.890 --> 00:08:35.080
that's happening right now.

00:08:35.080 --> 00:08:38.620
There's something going on
in performing arts right now.

00:08:38.620 --> 00:08:41.220
There's new avenues of digital
arts that are occurring.

00:08:41.220 --> 00:08:43.720
So that you may
not be witnessing

00:08:43.720 --> 00:08:48.400
certain things happening
let's say in popular music.

00:08:48.400 --> 00:08:50.390
But, you know, it's
also interesting

00:08:50.390 --> 00:08:57.000
that the first people to suffer
with the rise of technology,

00:08:57.000 --> 00:08:59.870
and hacker culture, and all
this were, like, musicians.

00:08:59.870 --> 00:09:02.240
And what, hackers don't
fucking like music--

00:09:02.240 --> 00:09:04.020
you know what I'm saying?

00:09:04.020 --> 00:09:06.450
But, you know,
the music industry

00:09:06.450 --> 00:09:11.170
suffered, but musicians
suffered as well, right?

00:09:11.170 --> 00:09:13.850
And so we may be
looking-- you know, like,

00:09:13.850 --> 00:09:15.767
if we look at popular
music, maybe we can say,

00:09:15.767 --> 00:09:18.183
OK, maybe you don't see a lot
of things addressed in that.

00:09:18.183 --> 00:09:19.240
But that's popular music.

00:09:19.240 --> 00:09:21.300
If you look at underground
movements in music,

00:09:21.300 --> 00:09:22.892
maybe you'll find more.

00:09:22.892 --> 00:09:24.100
And maybe it's not the music.

00:09:24.100 --> 00:09:26.350
Maybe it's in visual arts
where you're seeing it more.

00:09:26.350 --> 00:09:28.570
Maybe it's in, you know,
the world of graphic novels,

00:09:28.570 --> 00:09:31.750
for example, is blowing
up in America, you know?

00:09:31.750 --> 00:09:34.160
And there's a lot, like,
graphic artists that

00:09:34.160 --> 00:09:37.402
are approaching these
topics that we might want

00:09:37.402 --> 00:09:38.860
to hear more of in
music, but we're

00:09:38.860 --> 00:09:42.040
seeing it expressed
in a different way.

00:09:42.040 --> 00:09:43.830
JOSH: Who are some of
the artists-- like,

00:09:43.830 --> 00:09:45.700
you talk about graphic
artists and visual series.

00:09:45.700 --> 00:09:47.450
Who are some of those artists
that really inspire you?

00:09:47.450 --> 00:09:49.460
SAUL WILLIAMS: That
inspire me-- living?

00:09:49.460 --> 00:09:50.825
[LAUGHTER]

00:09:50.825 --> 00:09:52.775
I'm inspired by a
lot of dead people--

00:09:52.775 --> 00:09:56.586
[LAUGHTER] --that have been
killed by the systematic--

00:09:56.586 --> 00:09:58.826
[LAUGHTER]

00:09:59.730 --> 00:10:00.642
--seriously.

00:10:00.642 --> 00:10:03.840
[LAUGHTER]

00:10:03.840 --> 00:10:08.152
But who are people
that are inspiring me?

00:10:08.152 --> 00:10:12.520
Gosh, I always go blank when
that question is raised.

00:10:12.520 --> 00:10:13.879
There's tons of people.

00:10:13.879 --> 00:10:14.420
I don't know.

00:10:14.420 --> 00:10:16.510
On one hand, I might
say visual artists

00:10:16.510 --> 00:10:21.230
like let's say Wangechi Mutu,
or someone like Molly Crabapple,

00:10:21.230 --> 00:10:22.692
or a writer like Warren Ellis.

00:10:22.692 --> 00:10:24.150
This is-- you know,
like when we're

00:10:24.150 --> 00:10:26.900
talking about
graphic novel world,

00:10:26.900 --> 00:10:31.680
someone like Warren
Ellis, or because I really

00:10:31.680 --> 00:10:34.330
love, like, the
"Transmetropolitan" series,

00:10:34.330 --> 00:10:36.130
for example.

00:10:36.130 --> 00:10:37.890
I like filmmakers.

00:10:37.890 --> 00:10:45.980
Let's see, there
are weird people

00:10:45.980 --> 00:10:48.110
like-- I'm thinking
of dead people.

00:10:48.110 --> 00:10:51.200
But there's people like
[? Alan ?] [? Gomez. ?] If you

00:10:51.200 --> 00:10:52.262
want to help me, you can.

00:10:55.420 --> 00:11:00.240
There are people like-- I mean,
I'm still also discovering--

00:11:00.240 --> 00:11:02.830
discovering, like, roaming
through references.

00:11:02.830 --> 00:11:06.596
So there's also people like
Tarkovsky or Chris Marker,

00:11:06.596 --> 00:11:10.990
you know, that-- I think
that in the last poem, which

00:11:10.990 --> 00:11:14.640
is called "Coltan
as Cotton," I talk

00:11:14.640 --> 00:11:21.370
about the taste and the cultural
signifiers of taste, you know,

00:11:21.370 --> 00:11:25.750
and how we-- we have
our references here.

00:11:25.750 --> 00:11:27.420
Tarantino-- everybody--
oh, Tarantino--

00:11:27.420 --> 00:11:30.320
what do you think of the
latest Tarantino-- you know?

00:11:30.320 --> 00:11:33.710
Whereas maybe 20 years ago,
everybody might have been like,

00:11:33.710 --> 00:11:36.490
you know, what do you think of
the latest Cassavetes-- or not.

00:11:36.490 --> 00:11:40.310
You know, I remember going
to Amoeba Music in LA

00:11:40.310 --> 00:11:42.140
and looking in the
great directors

00:11:42.140 --> 00:11:43.410
section of their DVDs.

00:11:43.410 --> 00:11:45.524
And Cassavetes wasn't there.

00:11:45.524 --> 00:11:47.190
And I was there with
someone from France

00:11:47.190 --> 00:11:49.640
who was like, how is
Cassavetes not here when

00:11:49.640 --> 00:11:52.406
that is your greatest
director-- you know?

00:11:52.406 --> 00:11:54.330
So that we have
different references.

00:11:54.330 --> 00:11:55.180
JOSH: Right.

00:11:55.180 --> 00:11:58.090
SAUL WILLIAMS: You know-- and
ideas of what we think is great

00:11:58.090 --> 00:12:00.940
and how outsiders
look and go, no.

00:12:00.940 --> 00:12:03.820
That's what's great about
what you guys are creating

00:12:03.820 --> 00:12:04.555
or what have you.

00:12:04.555 --> 00:12:05.570
So I don't know.

00:12:05.570 --> 00:12:06.120
I don't know.

00:12:06.120 --> 00:12:07.280
But there's tons of people.

00:12:07.280 --> 00:12:09.020
But I can never think
of them when asked.

00:12:09.020 --> 00:12:09.652
[LAUGHTER]

00:12:09.652 --> 00:12:11.110
JOSH: Your story
reminds me of what

00:12:11.110 --> 00:12:13.190
we were talking about a little
bit earlier about in Chicago,

00:12:13.190 --> 00:12:14.055
the old Chess Records--

00:12:14.055 --> 00:12:14.846
SAUL WILLIAMS: Mhm.

00:12:14.846 --> 00:12:16.660
JOSH: --offices-- how
someone from France,

00:12:16.660 --> 00:12:18.934
a colleague of ours, stopped by.

00:12:18.934 --> 00:12:20.100
He wanted to see that place.

00:12:20.100 --> 00:12:22.110
And, like, for him, that was
a huge cultural reference.

00:12:22.110 --> 00:12:22.230
SAUL WILLIAMS: Yeah.

00:12:22.230 --> 00:12:23.660
JOSH: But in Chicago,
it might be overlooked.

00:12:23.660 --> 00:12:24.670
SAUL WILLIAMS: Exactly.

00:12:24.670 --> 00:12:26.430
And so, yeah.

00:12:26.430 --> 00:12:29.500
In response to that, I said,
you know, the Keith Richards

00:12:29.500 --> 00:12:32.145
book who talks about how the
Rolling Stones-- he says it

00:12:32.145 --> 00:12:34.910
in like the first chapter of
his book where he's just like,

00:12:34.910 --> 00:12:38.100
we basically sold the
blues back to Americans

00:12:38.100 --> 00:12:40.077
because they were too
racist to accept it

00:12:40.077 --> 00:12:41.660
from the black people
that created it.

00:12:41.660 --> 00:12:43.910
So we just sang blues songs
and gave it back to them.

00:12:43.910 --> 00:12:46.600
But they were like, how the
fuck are you not listening

00:12:46.600 --> 00:12:47.700
to this shit?

00:12:47.700 --> 00:12:49.810
Well, we'll just sing
their songs or, you know,

00:12:49.810 --> 00:12:51.080
rip off of their songs.

00:12:51.080 --> 00:12:52.520
Oh, and now you love it.

00:12:52.520 --> 00:12:53.420
JOSH: Yeah.

00:12:53.420 --> 00:12:56.200
SAUL WILLIAMS: Yeah, so
yeah, these references--

00:12:56.200 --> 00:12:58.410
but for them, in England,
in their schools,

00:12:58.410 --> 00:13:00.490
listening to those
Muddy Water or whatever,

00:13:00.490 --> 00:13:04.270
you know, Lightnin' Hopkins or
what have-- they-- blown away

00:13:04.270 --> 00:13:05.830
by it, blown away.

00:13:05.830 --> 00:13:07.180
And I'm also interested in that.

00:13:07.180 --> 00:13:09.670
I'm interested in the
dialogue between cultures.

00:13:09.670 --> 00:13:14.092
I'm interested in how,
you know, one blues singer

00:13:14.092 --> 00:13:15.550
named Pink and
another blues singer

00:13:15.550 --> 00:13:19.560
named Floyd can inspire some
kids, in England, you know,

00:13:19.560 --> 00:13:20.790
to come out with a band.

00:13:20.790 --> 00:13:22.630
And there's this
dialogue going on.

00:13:22.630 --> 00:13:26.250
Or you think of Fela
Kuti being in LA in '68

00:13:26.250 --> 00:13:31.330
and hearing, like, Jim Morrison,
and Sly Stone, and James Brown,

00:13:31.330 --> 00:13:35.810
and going back to Nigeria
and creating this sound.

00:13:35.810 --> 00:13:37.850
Before that, he's
making like jazz stuff--

00:13:37.850 --> 00:13:39.720
and going back and
creating this sound that

00:13:39.720 --> 00:13:45.220
is this fusion of this-- what
became Afro-pop but, you know,

00:13:45.220 --> 00:13:48.560
fused with this soul,
funk, and all this stuff.

00:13:48.560 --> 00:13:53.290
This dialogue between cultures,
which happens way more easily

00:13:53.290 --> 00:14:00.700
now with technology-- you see
it a lot with electronic artists

00:14:00.700 --> 00:14:05.922
and what have you, although not
as much as it could, you know?

00:14:05.922 --> 00:14:09.040
And I don't think there's enough
correspondence, necessarily,

00:14:09.040 --> 00:14:15.070
between-- like for
example, my current album

00:14:15.070 --> 00:14:16.050
"MartyrLoserKing."

00:14:16.050 --> 00:14:18.646
I'm really thinking
a lot about or I

00:14:18.646 --> 00:14:23.600
was listening to a lot of
traditional, like, folkways

00:14:23.600 --> 00:14:28.179
type recordings of traditional
music that some of it,

00:14:28.179 --> 00:14:29.720
let's say, comes
from the Great Lakes

00:14:29.720 --> 00:14:32.160
region of the continent
of Africa, right?

00:14:32.160 --> 00:14:33.920
And what I'm
interested in there is

00:14:33.920 --> 00:14:36.680
the minimalism and
the poly-rhythm,

00:14:36.680 --> 00:14:40.379
which juxtaposes itself
in the music in such a way

00:14:40.379 --> 00:14:42.170
so that at some point,
you feel like you're

00:14:42.170 --> 00:14:44.390
listening to digital music.

00:14:44.390 --> 00:14:45.140
It's trance music.

00:14:45.140 --> 00:14:46.639
You're like, this
is fucking trance.

00:14:46.639 --> 00:14:47.170
[LAUGHTER]

00:14:47.170 --> 00:14:50.965
And it's totally-- it
starts to feel electronic.

00:14:50.965 --> 00:14:52.950
And you're like holy shit.

00:14:52.950 --> 00:14:55.310
So that then the
question of what

00:14:55.310 --> 00:14:58.730
is actually the most
forward thinking

00:14:58.730 --> 00:15:01.320
or progressive sounding
thing, you put that

00:15:01.320 --> 00:15:03.940
alongside some like
EDM shit, and you're

00:15:03.940 --> 00:15:08.030
like those guys
are not doing shit,

00:15:08.030 --> 00:15:09.400
actually, except for the drop.

00:15:09.400 --> 00:15:11.820
[LAUGHTER]

00:15:11.820 --> 00:15:13.130
I respect the drop.

00:15:13.130 --> 00:15:15.050
JOSH: And apparently
it sounds amazing

00:15:15.050 --> 00:15:16.660
in cavernous Vegas nightclubs--

00:15:16.660 --> 00:15:17.070
SAUL WILLIAMS: Yeah.

00:15:17.070 --> 00:15:18.111
JOSH: --from what I hear.

00:15:18.111 --> 00:15:20.065
SAUL WILLIAMS: You know, yeah.

00:15:20.065 --> 00:15:22.440
JOSH: So let's talk about
"MartyrLoserKing" a little bit.

00:15:22.440 --> 00:15:23.481
SAUL WILLIAMS: All right.

00:15:23.481 --> 00:15:25.870
JOSH: Because you were talking
about the tribal drumming

00:15:25.870 --> 00:15:28.180
and those poly-rhythms
and then fusing

00:15:28.180 --> 00:15:29.590
that with digital electronics.

00:15:29.590 --> 00:15:30.381
SAUL WILLIAMS: Mhm.

00:15:30.381 --> 00:15:32.370
JOSH: It does have
that trance-like sound.

00:15:32.370 --> 00:15:34.886
But as far as the story,
it's a sprawling concept.

00:15:34.886 --> 00:15:35.860
SAUL WILLIAMS: Mhm.

00:15:35.860 --> 00:15:37.680
JOSH: Some of your
lyrics from the album

00:15:37.680 --> 00:15:38.810
are in the book "USA--"

00:15:38.810 --> 00:15:39.090
SAUL WILLIAMS: Yeah.

00:15:39.090 --> 00:15:39.750
JOSH: --like "Coltan as Cotton."

00:15:39.750 --> 00:15:41.910
SAUL WILLIAMS: I was working
on it at same time, yeah.

00:15:41.910 --> 00:15:43.618
JOSH: So tell us about
"MartyrLoserKing."

00:15:43.618 --> 00:15:44.670
What does that mean?

00:15:44.670 --> 00:15:45.900
Who is this character?

00:15:45.900 --> 00:15:48.025
SAUL WILLIAMS: "MartyrLoserKing"
is the screen name

00:15:48.025 --> 00:15:51.650
of a hacker who lives in Central
Africa, in Burundi, actually.

00:15:51.650 --> 00:15:56.170
And it's a guy who's
hiding out in Burundi.

00:15:56.170 --> 00:15:59.910
And I chose this region,
because essentially,

00:15:59.910 --> 00:16:03.000
this region, the
Congo, Rwanda, Burundi,

00:16:03.000 --> 00:16:06.630
is one of the spots where you
find the largest collection

00:16:06.630 --> 00:16:09.610
of cobalt, coltan, you know.

00:16:09.610 --> 00:16:15.620
And what I find interesting
about our reliance

00:16:15.620 --> 00:16:20.850
on these resources, the same
way we have relied on rubber,

00:16:20.850 --> 00:16:23.200
you know, like coffee, sugar.

00:16:23.200 --> 00:16:28.080
There's a long history
of mining these regions

00:16:28.080 --> 00:16:35.640
and exploitation juxtaposed
with Western comfort, right?

00:16:35.640 --> 00:16:40.830
And the irony is that
coltan is something

00:16:40.830 --> 00:16:46.760
that distributes power through
small circuitry boards, right.

00:16:46.760 --> 00:16:49.750
Distributes power-- so I'm
thinking about the distribution

00:16:49.750 --> 00:16:52.810
of power-- right-- and the
distribution of wealth,

00:16:52.810 --> 00:16:57.480
and all these things, and
the blocks along the way.

00:16:57.480 --> 00:17:01.530
And for me, I found
it interesting.

00:17:01.530 --> 00:17:05.980
And this isn't necessarily
what the story is about.

00:17:05.980 --> 00:17:08.220
But I'm saying this as an aside.

00:17:08.220 --> 00:17:10.619
What I find interesting
is that so many

00:17:10.619 --> 00:17:15.290
of our tech, digital,
virtual advances

00:17:15.290 --> 00:17:19.409
are so heavily reliant
on analog exploitation.

00:17:22.010 --> 00:17:25.890
And I'm trying to figure out
how we can make real advances.

00:17:25.890 --> 00:17:29.280
I'll count it as
real when it doesn't

00:17:29.280 --> 00:17:33.340
involve analog exploitation.

00:17:33.340 --> 00:17:35.350
What I mean by that
is just old school,

00:17:35.350 --> 00:17:37.350
commonplace exploitation.

00:17:37.350 --> 00:17:39.630
You can imagine
the story of what's

00:17:39.630 --> 00:17:43.895
happening around those mines,
who owns them, you know,

00:17:43.895 --> 00:17:47.000
and all the, like,
domino effect reactions

00:17:47.000 --> 00:17:51.850
of the bullshit surrounding
that leading to us, you know,

00:17:51.850 --> 00:17:55.570
calling the next Uber.

00:17:55.570 --> 00:17:58.295
So I have a village
of hackers who

00:17:58.295 --> 00:18:00.420
live in a place that's
called Martyr Loser Kingdom.

00:18:00.420 --> 00:18:04.030
And they built this
village at this place,

00:18:04.030 --> 00:18:05.860
not at a coltan mine, actually.

00:18:05.860 --> 00:18:07.790
It's a bunch of,
like, escapee miners

00:18:07.790 --> 00:18:09.690
who end up at a
e-waste camp, which

00:18:09.690 --> 00:18:14.670
is where all of our digital
shit, hardware goes to die.

00:18:14.670 --> 00:18:18.980
And so you have mounds of
motherboards and all this shit.

00:18:18.980 --> 00:18:22.290
But they arrived there-- one
guy arrives there like right

00:18:22.290 --> 00:18:23.997
at the cusp of rainy season.

00:18:23.997 --> 00:18:25.830
And the main thing that
he needs is shelter.

00:18:25.830 --> 00:18:27.540
And so he ends up
building this shack out

00:18:27.540 --> 00:18:29.030
of old computer parts.

00:18:29.030 --> 00:18:31.000
Other people see
what's going on end up.

00:18:31.000 --> 00:18:34.370
There's a village that's then
built of old computer parts.

00:18:34.370 --> 00:18:35.920
The story is sci-fi.

00:18:35.920 --> 00:18:39.940
So there is a character
that arrives who is a modem.

00:18:39.940 --> 00:18:45.760
And-- [LAUGHTER]-- and so it is
the story essentially of what

00:18:45.760 --> 00:18:50.320
happens when this
village connects.

00:18:50.320 --> 00:18:59.270
And it's also a story about how,
because of the sort of, like,

00:18:59.270 --> 00:19:03.270
utility aligned with
necessity and what have you,

00:19:03.270 --> 00:19:05.360
what happens when--
you know, there's

00:19:05.360 --> 00:19:09.810
a character there in the story
who creates a-- and these are

00:19:09.810 --> 00:19:12.300
taken from real stories--
but who builds a 3D printing

00:19:12.300 --> 00:19:17.830
machine, for example, you
know-- which is very necessary,

00:19:17.830 --> 00:19:21.760
because in this story, there's
all sorts of people needing

00:19:21.760 --> 00:19:22.780
all sorts of things.

00:19:22.780 --> 00:19:24.942
And so they're
providing anything

00:19:24.942 --> 00:19:26.650
from prosthetic limbs
and all this stuff.

00:19:26.650 --> 00:19:30.350
So you have this kind of
like almost cyborg community

00:19:30.350 --> 00:19:35.840
that is the most advanced
tech hub on the planet,

00:19:35.840 --> 00:19:39.120
actually, that no
one knows about.

00:19:39.120 --> 00:19:42.960
And eventually, basically, he
becomes like a virtual Banksy.

00:19:42.960 --> 00:19:45.503
At first, he's just
doing some, like, kind

00:19:45.503 --> 00:19:50.980
of gray hat sort of hacking
shit that's just kind of funny.

00:19:50.980 --> 00:19:53.233
But, you know, it
gains in popularity.

00:19:55.780 --> 00:19:59.130
And it gets a little crazy when
he starts playing around with,

00:19:59.130 --> 00:20:02.310
like, that amber alert
technology, the shit that

00:20:02.310 --> 00:20:06.500
allows him to choose a region
and send a message to a bunch

00:20:06.500 --> 00:20:07.980
of people in a region.

00:20:07.980 --> 00:20:12.010
And then it gets crazy when
they hack into a satellite.

00:20:12.010 --> 00:20:15.280
Because then it's a question
of security and defense.

00:20:15.280 --> 00:20:19.140
And so they go-- he goes from
virtual fame or notoriety

00:20:19.140 --> 00:20:22.400
to being labeled a terrorist.

00:20:22.400 --> 00:20:27.870
And what's funny is
that their community is

00:20:27.870 --> 00:20:31.280
able to exist much longer
than one would imagine,

00:20:31.280 --> 00:20:35.680
because the Western intelligence
sees the signal coming

00:20:35.680 --> 00:20:38.270
from there and is like,
well, obviously somebody

00:20:38.270 --> 00:20:39.515
is throwing their signal.

00:20:39.515 --> 00:20:41.000
[LAUGHTER]

00:20:41.000 --> 00:20:44.350
There is no fucking way that
this is coming from Burundi.

00:20:44.350 --> 00:20:45.810
And so it's also about that.

00:20:45.810 --> 00:20:46.484
[LAUGHTER]

00:20:46.484 --> 00:20:48.400
Like, you'll never find
us just because you're

00:20:48.400 --> 00:20:51.680
too arrogant to look at the
source of where this shit is

00:20:51.680 --> 00:20:53.480
coming from, you know?

00:20:53.480 --> 00:20:54.940
So it's also about that.

00:20:54.940 --> 00:20:58.140
But yeah, Martyr Loser King
starts off as an individual.

00:20:58.140 --> 00:21:00.230
But then it becomes a
title once Martyr Loser

00:21:00.230 --> 00:21:03.690
King, the first one,
is killed after being

00:21:03.690 --> 00:21:05.540
labeled a terrorist.

00:21:05.540 --> 00:21:07.810
And then there's someone,
another character

00:21:07.810 --> 00:21:11.500
named Neptune Frost, who
is the Martyr Loser King.

00:21:11.500 --> 00:21:15.190
And so it's just about
this hacker community,

00:21:15.190 --> 00:21:20.630
this anarchist group that
influences society as we know

00:21:20.630 --> 00:21:23.580
it through initially
a bunch of, like,

00:21:23.580 --> 00:21:25.710
funny hacks that's-- you
know, it's kind of like,

00:21:25.710 --> 00:21:27.350
I don't know, Guccifer.

00:21:27.350 --> 00:21:29.550
You know, you guys know
the hacker Guccifer

00:21:29.550 --> 00:21:33.260
who, like, took
George Bush's emails

00:21:33.260 --> 00:21:35.450
and showed the world
that he was painting

00:21:35.450 --> 00:21:37.080
and all this sort of stuff.

00:21:37.080 --> 00:21:42.120
And I think Guccifer--
they're using Guccifer now

00:21:42.120 --> 00:21:46.280
to try to incriminate
Hillary Clinton.

00:21:46.280 --> 00:21:48.630
Yeah, they locked up Guccifer.

00:21:48.630 --> 00:21:53.170
He was in-- I forget where he
was-- Armenia or something,

00:21:53.170 --> 00:21:57.960
Hungary-- I forget where
this guy is actually from.

00:21:57.960 --> 00:22:00.390
But yeah, he became
sort of known.

00:22:00.390 --> 00:22:01.150
He got caught.

00:22:01.150 --> 00:22:04.400
And now they're trying to say,
look, you know, they use him.

00:22:04.400 --> 00:22:06.690
He's one of the
locked up hackers who,

00:22:06.690 --> 00:22:09.310
like, makes these
deals and like, OK,

00:22:09.310 --> 00:22:13.290
you have access to a computer
if you can help us-- blah, blah,

00:22:13.290 --> 00:22:15.380
blah, blah-- you know?

00:22:15.380 --> 00:22:17.760
And so it's about
all of this stuff.

00:22:17.760 --> 00:22:20.300
It's about the whistle
blowing stuff that's going on.

00:22:20.300 --> 00:22:22.040
It's about transparency.

00:22:22.040 --> 00:22:26.380
It's about the tech
wave of the moment,

00:22:26.380 --> 00:22:31.860
but centered in the place
where-- that is dependent,

00:22:31.860 --> 00:22:35.580
that this whole thing is
dependent on, in a sense,

00:22:35.580 --> 00:22:36.340
you know?

00:22:36.340 --> 00:22:39.790
And it's really
just a way for me

00:22:39.790 --> 00:22:43.270
to dump a lot of current issues,
like, into my drum machine

00:22:43.270 --> 00:22:48.300
and talk about them with
the slight veil of fiction.

00:22:48.300 --> 00:22:49.562
JOSH: Yeah.

00:22:49.562 --> 00:22:51.520
I know one of the tracks
on the album, "Ashes,"

00:22:51.520 --> 00:22:53.669
I think you wrote that
after it was Eric Garner--

00:22:53.669 --> 00:22:54.460
SAUL WILLIAMS: Mhm.

00:22:54.460 --> 00:22:55.910
JOSH: --passed away.

00:22:55.910 --> 00:22:57.986
So there are a lot
of other factors

00:22:57.986 --> 00:22:59.360
that come into
the record, again,

00:22:59.360 --> 00:23:00.450
like you were
saying, like social.

00:23:00.450 --> 00:23:01.750
SAUL WILLIAMS: Oh,
yeah, yeah, yeah.

00:23:01.750 --> 00:23:02.510
Exactly, yeah.

00:23:02.510 --> 00:23:05.380
I mean, I'm definitely
talking about everything

00:23:05.380 --> 00:23:08.350
from-- I mean, with
a story like that--

00:23:08.350 --> 00:23:12.420
and then there's the character
Neptune Frost who's trans

00:23:12.420 --> 00:23:17.770
actually, who's from Uganda,
where the anti-gay laws brought

00:23:17.770 --> 00:23:23.620
by American evangelicals,
you know, are rampant.

00:23:23.620 --> 00:23:24.600
And so, yeah.

00:23:24.600 --> 00:23:28.800
The story allows me to talk
about everything from feelings

00:23:28.800 --> 00:23:33.350
about the police, to feelings
about the militarization

00:23:33.350 --> 00:23:36.672
of police forces, of
all of these things.

00:23:36.672 --> 00:23:38.130
Why don't I play
a song real quick?

00:23:38.130 --> 00:23:38.420
JOSH: Yeah.

00:23:38.420 --> 00:23:38.710
Sounds great.

00:23:38.710 --> 00:23:40.876
SAUL WILLIAMS: I want to
do a song called "The Noise

00:23:40.876 --> 00:23:42.557
Came From Here."

00:23:42.557 --> 00:23:43.890
I'm not going to play the video.

00:23:43.890 --> 00:23:48.130
Although I'm running software
right now that a designer

00:23:48.130 --> 00:23:50.790
friend of mine named
[? Missy ?] [? El ?] [? Leon ?]

00:23:50.790 --> 00:23:55.680
who's in Mexico but created
this software that we've taken

00:23:55.680 --> 00:23:58.780
on the road with us as we're
touring-- and basically,

00:23:58.780 --> 00:24:00.480
we're able to feed it.

00:24:00.480 --> 00:24:04.390
I'm able to feed it text,
images, which he glitches up.

00:24:04.390 --> 00:24:09.300
And it randomizes as we go so
it's happening in real time

00:24:09.300 --> 00:24:10.430
as we're on stage.

00:24:10.430 --> 00:24:13.510
But yeah, it's interesting.

00:24:13.510 --> 00:24:16.240
So anyway, I want to just do
the song called "The Noise Come

From Here."

00:24:16.740 --> 00:24:17.680

do something really quick,

00:28:18.530 --> 00:28:24.130
ignores the data-- ignores
the data-- ignores the data.

00:28:24.130 --> 00:28:27.950
But he keeps building
the wall between the poor

00:28:27.950 --> 00:28:32.000
and the rich building,
headquarters for the police

00:28:32.000 --> 00:28:35.460
worth a billion.

00:28:35.460 --> 00:28:39.170
They make a killing.

00:28:39.170 --> 00:28:42.570
Protect and serve,
your bullets won't

00:28:42.570 --> 00:28:47.815
deliver the last word, Police
of the religions as absurd.

00:28:50.670 --> 00:28:51.480
Fuck the word.

00:28:54.380 --> 00:28:56.640
Heed the feeling.

00:28:56.640 --> 00:29:00.320
The calculated
masses are appealing,

00:29:00.320 --> 00:29:02.935
the jury hung from
every museum ceiling.

00:29:08.930 --> 00:29:18.070
History tries its best
to keep us kneeling.

00:29:20.650 --> 00:29:26.550
We have come standing on
a field of bankers' dung,

00:29:26.550 --> 00:29:30.340
extinguishing the
fires of the young.

00:29:30.340 --> 00:29:32.840
We should have listened
when the sirens rung.

00:29:35.660 --> 00:29:40.395
Cause we found hem dancing
on the graves of the ones who

00:29:40.395 --> 00:29:43.110
had renowned them.

00:29:43.110 --> 00:29:44.891
And they couldn't give a fuck.

00:29:47.840 --> 00:29:52.300
All right, so check it out.

00:29:52.300 --> 00:29:53.080
Come back up here.

00:29:53.080 --> 00:29:53.580
[APPLAUSE]

00:29:53.580 --> 00:29:55.170
Thanks.

00:29:55.170 --> 00:29:57.916
One, I didn't show
the video, because I

00:29:57.916 --> 00:29:59.790
wanted you guys to see
some of this software.

00:29:59.790 --> 00:30:02.500
But we have the
director for the video

00:30:02.500 --> 00:30:05.860
from "The Noise Came From Here,"
the first song I recorded,

00:30:05.860 --> 00:30:09.860
performed here, Anisia Uzeyman.

00:30:09.860 --> 00:30:14.030
And that video,
just to show some

00:30:14.030 --> 00:30:21.480
of how we're connecting
that story to global issues

00:30:21.480 --> 00:30:24.370
and what have you, we
shot it in Ferguson.

00:30:24.370 --> 00:30:30.736
And we shot it around the area
where Michael Brown's body

00:30:30.736 --> 00:30:33.340
had laid for many hours.

00:30:33.340 --> 00:30:35.130
And there's now
a memorial there.

00:30:35.130 --> 00:30:38.740
We shot it around that
memorial-- and not simply

00:30:38.740 --> 00:30:41.780
there, as you'll see if
you check out the video.

00:30:41.780 --> 00:30:46.660
But part of-- but the song
itself uses a sample that

00:30:46.660 --> 00:30:53.440
comes from the Twa,
which is a group that's

00:30:53.440 --> 00:30:59.360
found in Rwanda in the
Great Lakes region that's

00:30:59.360 --> 00:31:06.110
kind of, you know, somewhat
disappeared in a similar way

00:31:06.110 --> 00:31:09.020
that a lot of Native Americans
have been disappeared here

00:31:09.020 --> 00:31:12.860
in the States and
in the Americas.

00:31:12.860 --> 00:31:16.140
But you see, we're
taking sounds from there,

00:31:16.140 --> 00:31:22.470
electronic sounds, ideas that
really-- that are not just

00:31:22.470 --> 00:31:22.970
here.

00:31:22.970 --> 00:31:24.975
Because when you talk
about, you know, like,

00:31:24.975 --> 00:31:30.610
there's that idea in the
song "Ashes," which followed,

00:31:30.610 --> 00:31:33.070
where as you mentioned,
it is partially

00:31:33.070 --> 00:31:35.150
a response to Eric Garner.

00:31:35.150 --> 00:31:36.750
There the lyric
that I love, which

00:31:36.750 --> 00:31:39.280
is "headquarters for the
police worth a billion."

00:31:39.280 --> 00:31:42.350
Because New York is building
this billion dollar police

00:31:42.350 --> 00:31:43.790
headquarters, you know?

00:31:43.790 --> 00:31:47.020
They make a killing
is the statement.

00:31:49.630 --> 00:31:52.410
But the thing is, it's
not just in America.

00:31:52.410 --> 00:31:54.650
There's people in
Haiti, in the Congo,

00:31:54.650 --> 00:31:56.720
around the world with
the same, like, fuck

00:31:56.720 --> 00:31:58.250
the police sentiment.

00:31:58.250 --> 00:31:59.960
I can say that in
Google offices, right?

00:31:59.960 --> 00:32:01.480
Fuck the police--
is that all right?

00:32:01.480 --> 00:32:10.070
And so-- [LAUGHTER]-- and so
what's important for me is

00:32:10.070 --> 00:32:14.320
to realize that-- because a lot
of times we get stuck in this

00:32:14.320 --> 00:32:17.130
binary sort of thinking where
we think it's black and white,

00:32:17.130 --> 00:32:17.890
it's racism.

00:32:17.890 --> 00:32:20.790
But it's a question of power.

00:32:20.790 --> 00:32:24.850
It's a question of power,
a question of authority.

00:32:24.850 --> 00:32:29.222
And of course when you talk
about these mega corporations,

00:32:29.222 --> 00:32:30.930
and [? businesses ?],
and all this stuff,

00:32:30.930 --> 00:32:35.550
and the authority that
they begin to yield.

00:32:35.550 --> 00:32:37.960
Even in a corporate-- I
mean, in a political climate

00:32:37.960 --> 00:32:41.790
in this day and age,
it's important for us

00:32:41.790 --> 00:32:46.100
as people to also
realize the power

00:32:46.100 --> 00:32:50.300
that we can wield in questioning
authority and challenging

00:32:50.300 --> 00:32:51.910
authority, you know?

00:32:51.910 --> 00:32:55.680
And so for me, I'm just
juxtaposing those worlds,

00:32:55.680 --> 00:32:57.140
trying to connect a few dots.

00:32:57.140 --> 00:33:01.490
I mean, that's pretty
much the idea--

00:33:01.490 --> 00:33:03.800
and [? is ?] [? it ?]
expressed for example,

00:33:03.800 --> 00:33:08.830
when you see protesters
in Ferguson being advised

00:33:08.830 --> 00:33:13.120
by people living in Gaza and
in Palestine and saying, oh,

00:33:13.120 --> 00:33:17.160
this is how you, you know,
respond to tear gas, you know,

00:33:17.160 --> 00:33:19.330
like the sharing
information and all that.

00:33:19.330 --> 00:33:21.560
There's beautiful
things that technology

00:33:21.560 --> 00:33:23.050
has allowed us to share.

00:33:23.050 --> 00:33:26.200
And so I'm just trying to
share some of those ideas

00:33:26.200 --> 00:33:28.190
through music, and
art, and what have you.

00:33:28.190 --> 00:33:28.690
JOSH: Yeah.

00:33:28.690 --> 00:33:29.190
Yeah.

00:33:29.190 --> 00:33:31.010
Technology can--
as you mentioned,

00:33:31.010 --> 00:33:32.850
it can be a catalyst
for social change.

00:33:32.850 --> 00:33:35.100
And you mentioned some things
in the international community.

00:33:35.100 --> 00:33:35.970
And you've lived abroad.

00:33:35.970 --> 00:33:36.390
SAUL WILLIAMS: Mhm.

00:33:36.390 --> 00:33:37.040
JOSH: You've lived in Paris.

00:33:37.040 --> 00:33:37.450
I think you've--

00:33:37.450 --> 00:33:38.206
SAUL WILLIAMS: I
lived in Brazil.

00:33:38.206 --> 00:33:38.602
JOSH: In Brazil?

00:33:38.602 --> 00:33:39.451
SAUL WILLIAMS: Yeah.

00:33:39.451 --> 00:33:40.950
JOSH: In fact, one
of our colleagues

00:33:40.950 --> 00:33:42.824
also noticed that in
one of your other songs,

00:33:42.824 --> 00:33:44.530
you actually cut
into Portuguese.

00:33:44.530 --> 00:33:46.570
SAUL WILLIAMS: Yeah,
"Think Like the Book Say."

00:33:46.570 --> 00:33:47.070
Yeah.

00:33:47.070 --> 00:33:48.902
JOSH: So having lived
abroad, how does

00:33:48.902 --> 00:33:50.110
that affect your perceptions?

00:33:50.110 --> 00:33:53.390
And how have your perceptions
as being an American changed?

00:33:53.390 --> 00:33:56.030
SAUL WILLIAMS: Well, I lived
in Brazil when I was 16.

00:33:56.030 --> 00:33:57.510
I was an exchange student.

00:33:57.510 --> 00:34:00.480
And I'm from New York,
from a small city

00:34:00.480 --> 00:34:05.020
like 60 miles outside of New
York called Newburgh, New York.

00:34:05.020 --> 00:34:06.690
And so I arrived there.

00:34:06.690 --> 00:34:07.650
I'm 16.

00:34:07.650 --> 00:34:10.810
I'm a junior in high school.

00:34:10.810 --> 00:34:13.070
I'm supposed to be
there for a year.

00:34:13.070 --> 00:34:14.730
I was there for a year.

00:34:14.730 --> 00:34:18.830
The first thing that
happens is, I-- and I

00:34:18.830 --> 00:34:21.830
talk about this in the
introduction to "USA."

00:34:21.830 --> 00:34:26.610
I talk about how I arrive
there and, well, first, school

00:34:26.610 --> 00:34:28.199
is on strike.

00:34:28.199 --> 00:34:30.322
So I find out I'm not going
to be going to school,

00:34:30.322 --> 00:34:31.780
because the teachers
are on strike.

00:34:31.780 --> 00:34:33.980
And that strike
lasted for six months.

00:34:33.980 --> 00:34:35.909
In fact, I was an exchange
student to Brazil.

00:34:35.909 --> 00:34:38.075
But I did not go to school
while I lived in Brazil--

00:34:38.075 --> 00:34:39.530
[LAUGHTER]

00:34:39.530 --> 00:34:42.360
--which was fine by me.

00:34:42.360 --> 00:34:43.880
And then the other
side of it was

00:34:43.880 --> 00:34:49.270
that if school were not on
strike, as a 16-year-old,

00:34:49.270 --> 00:34:52.130
I would have had to
go to night school.

00:34:52.130 --> 00:34:54.409
Because if you were
15 or older, it

00:34:54.409 --> 00:34:56.820
was expected that you would
be working in the fields

00:34:56.820 --> 00:34:59.690
during the day.

00:34:59.690 --> 00:35:03.570
And so high school
was only night school.

00:35:03.570 --> 00:35:05.160
And so me and my
little, you know,

00:35:05.160 --> 00:35:08.630
Public Enemy in my headphones
and all this shit was like,

00:35:08.630 --> 00:35:09.425
what?

00:35:09.425 --> 00:35:12.630
You know, like just
this crazy reaction

00:35:12.630 --> 00:35:14.930
so that suddenly, I'm
starting to realize--

00:35:14.930 --> 00:35:21.550
and so you juxtapose that with
the fact that people you know,

00:35:21.550 --> 00:35:25.020
like-- when school actually
did start, by that time

00:35:25.020 --> 00:35:27.210
I had befriended the
English teacher who was also

00:35:27.210 --> 00:35:29.570
my Capoeira instructor.

00:35:29.570 --> 00:35:33.580
And so I went as an assistant.

00:35:33.580 --> 00:35:36.330
And I only went a few times,
because whenever I would go,

00:35:36.330 --> 00:35:37.550
school would just stop.

00:35:37.550 --> 00:35:39.760
And everyone would
gather around me and just

00:35:39.760 --> 00:35:41.350
be like, we have questions.

00:35:41.350 --> 00:35:43.950
We have questions, you know?

00:35:43.950 --> 00:35:48.480
And one of the first
questions I was always

00:35:48.480 --> 00:35:52.050
asked whatever city I visited
was, is America really free?

00:35:52.050 --> 00:35:54.840
Is it free like in the movies,
like we see in the movies?

00:35:54.840 --> 00:35:56.230
Is it really free?

00:35:56.230 --> 00:35:57.210
Is it free with sex?

00:35:57.210 --> 00:35:59.430
Is it free like we
see in the movies?

00:35:59.430 --> 00:36:02.250
The other question
I'd get asked was--

00:36:02.250 --> 00:36:05.040
and this was all
the time-- what's it

00:36:05.040 --> 00:36:08.395
like to be sprayed
with a fire hose?

00:36:08.395 --> 00:36:10.220
JOSH: Mm.

00:36:10.220 --> 00:36:13.836
SAUL WILLIAMS: And I'd be
like, oh, you mean my parents.

00:36:13.836 --> 00:36:18.829
[LAUGHTER] I have no idea.
[LAUGHTER] I have no idea.

00:36:18.829 --> 00:36:20.620
But I would always get
asked this question,

00:36:20.620 --> 00:36:22.730
because the images
that were diffused

00:36:22.730 --> 00:36:26.380
through media that they
were getting were old.

00:36:26.380 --> 00:36:28.360
And so like, oh, a
black guy from America,

00:36:28.360 --> 00:36:33.160
you must know what that's--
what's that like, you know?

00:36:33.160 --> 00:36:36.330
And so what did it do to me to
be-- like, how did that shift

00:36:36.330 --> 00:36:38.720
my perspective of America?

00:36:38.720 --> 00:36:44.070
Well, the best way I
can answer that is I

00:36:44.070 --> 00:36:46.850
remember my first trip
to the supermarket.

00:36:46.850 --> 00:36:48.870
And I was told by
my host family,

00:36:48.870 --> 00:36:50.970
they're explaining to
me, like, everything

00:36:50.970 --> 00:36:54.910
that you find in the supermarket
comes from no more than like 20

00:36:54.910 --> 00:37:00.900
miles around this place.

00:37:00.900 --> 00:37:02.900
And then I'm looking
at the fruit.

00:37:02.900 --> 00:37:06.650
And there's, like-- you know,
there's black in the bananas.

00:37:06.650 --> 00:37:08.820
And the oranges
aren't as orange.

00:37:08.820 --> 00:37:11.740
And you know, I see all this
kind of discolored stuff.

00:37:11.740 --> 00:37:13.500
But I'm from the states.

00:37:13.500 --> 00:37:14.880
So I'm like, oh, wow.

00:37:14.880 --> 00:37:17.300
I expected that this
tropical-- I thought this was

00:37:17.300 --> 00:37:18.614
going to be-- and I'd taste it.

00:37:18.614 --> 00:37:19.405
And it's delicious.

00:37:19.405 --> 00:37:22.470
And I'm like, but it's
not-- he's like, ah, well,

00:37:22.470 --> 00:37:26.680
there's a farm over there that's
owned by an American company.

00:37:26.680 --> 00:37:29.460
And they use these chemicals.

00:37:29.460 --> 00:37:32.060
But we don't use those on ours.

00:37:32.060 --> 00:37:33.860
And so if you're looking
for the stuff that

00:37:33.860 --> 00:37:38.242
looks like your idea of an
orange, your idea of that,

00:37:38.242 --> 00:37:40.200
that's over there where
they use the chemicals.

00:37:40.200 --> 00:37:43.200
Here in our supermarket
is just the real shit.

00:37:43.200 --> 00:37:43.710
Taste it.

00:37:43.710 --> 00:37:45.630
I'm like, oh, it's delicious.

00:37:45.630 --> 00:37:47.880
Good enough, huh?

00:37:47.880 --> 00:37:50.770
And so those were
the sort of things

00:37:50.770 --> 00:37:53.940
that I was like, oh, oh wow.

00:37:53.940 --> 00:37:55.229
Now there's other side, right?

00:37:55.229 --> 00:37:57.520
The other side was that at
the time when I lived there,

00:37:57.520 --> 00:37:59.064
there really was
no middle class.

00:37:59.064 --> 00:38:01.230
And we hear that here with
politicians all the time.

00:38:01.230 --> 00:38:03.188
Like we're-- we're
destroying our middle class,

00:38:03.188 --> 00:38:04.400
and all the shit.

00:38:04.400 --> 00:38:07.460
But I lived with a family.

00:38:07.460 --> 00:38:11.210
This is in 1989-- 1989 to '90.

00:38:11.210 --> 00:38:14.190
I lived with a Japanese
family in Brazil.

00:38:14.190 --> 00:38:18.730
The largest demographic
of Japanese living outside

00:38:18.730 --> 00:38:19.840
of Japan is in Brazil.

00:38:19.840 --> 00:38:23.280
And it's been that way
for like 100 years.

00:38:23.280 --> 00:38:25.360
And so I lived with
a Japanese family

00:38:25.360 --> 00:38:28.490
there who owned
sugar plantations

00:38:28.490 --> 00:38:30.670
in the north of Brazil.

00:38:30.670 --> 00:38:33.780
And they were oil rich,
because at that time,

00:38:33.780 --> 00:38:37.320
most cars in Brazil
ran on ethanol, which

00:38:37.320 --> 00:38:43.090
came from sugar cane-- then.

00:38:43.090 --> 00:38:46.410
So also we have to remember,
it's not about technology

00:38:46.410 --> 00:38:47.980
half the time.

00:38:47.980 --> 00:38:50.430
It's about these
fucking lobbyists who

00:38:50.430 --> 00:38:53.700
are trying to slow
the-- you know, I mean,

00:38:53.700 --> 00:38:56.280
the first car was electric.

00:38:56.280 --> 00:38:58.400
The second one was biodiesel.

00:38:58.400 --> 00:39:03.370
You know, like it's-- for
real, it's not so much that

00:39:03.370 --> 00:39:06.380
technology has not
afforded certain--

00:39:06.380 --> 00:39:08.660
it's these corporations
that have had this--

00:39:08.660 --> 00:39:09.850
exerted this control.

00:39:09.850 --> 00:39:13.110
So yeah, I was living with a
family that was making oil,

00:39:13.110 --> 00:39:19.410
making ethanol out of sugar
cane and in this beautiful house

00:39:19.410 --> 00:39:24.932
that was next door to people
who lived with a dirt floor.

00:39:24.932 --> 00:39:26.640
And when I say there
was no middle class,

00:39:26.640 --> 00:39:28.200
that's what I mean.

00:39:28.200 --> 00:39:31.690
I mean like literally next
door, people had a dirt floor.

00:39:31.690 --> 00:39:36.260
And I'm in a house that had
a green room, a greenhouse

00:39:36.260 --> 00:39:39.880
in the middle of the
house with birds living

00:39:39.880 --> 00:39:41.700
in the wall with the
little microphones

00:39:41.700 --> 00:39:43.826
that they had little
knobs around the house.

00:39:43.826 --> 00:39:46.200
If you wanted to have the
tropical feel around the house,

00:39:46.200 --> 00:39:48.075
you could just turn up
the knob in your room.

00:39:48.574 --> 00:39:49.165
My bedroom--

00:39:49.165 --> 00:39:50.232
[LAUGHTER]

00:39:50.232 --> 00:39:51.060
It's true.

00:39:51.060 --> 00:39:54.570
My bedroom-- they
had two other kids.

00:39:54.570 --> 00:39:58.090
And so the third
bedroom was actually

00:39:58.090 --> 00:40:00.330
the house's music
room where they had

00:40:00.330 --> 00:40:03.990
a stereo built into the wall.

00:40:03.990 --> 00:40:05.140
And that was my bedroom.

00:40:05.140 --> 00:40:07.620
And that may be
why I'm here now.

00:40:07.620 --> 00:40:11.540
Because living in
that room, which

00:40:11.540 --> 00:40:15.060
was soundproof, which
I could shut the door

00:40:15.060 --> 00:40:18.220
and put on anything I want,
turn it up as loud as I want.

00:40:18.220 --> 00:40:20.270
And the sound was literally
coming from the wall.

00:40:20.270 --> 00:40:21.770
And I would be
jumping on the bed

00:40:21.770 --> 00:40:25.590
like fucking-- like--
with no school.

00:40:25.590 --> 00:40:28.260
[LAUGHTER]

00:40:29.706 --> 00:40:32.590
You know, yeah, it
was fucking crazy.

00:40:32.590 --> 00:40:38.210
But in terms of America,
I learned a lot.

00:40:38.210 --> 00:40:39.070
I learned a lot.

00:40:39.070 --> 00:40:41.930
Another big lesson
for me was traveling.

00:40:41.930 --> 00:40:45.220
At one point I traveled for two
months with 50 other exchange

00:40:45.220 --> 00:40:49.950
students from around the
world and suddenly realized

00:40:49.950 --> 00:40:51.780
how stupid I was.

00:40:51.780 --> 00:40:54.951
Because all the kids from like
Denmark, England, Australia,

00:40:54.951 --> 00:40:56.950
France, you know, they'd
be sitting there going,

00:40:56.950 --> 00:40:58.370
did you hear about what
happened in Zimbabwe?

00:40:58.370 --> 00:41:00.370
Oh my God, da-da-da, I
read about the thing that

00:41:00.370 --> 00:41:01.770
went down in Beirut, da-da-da.

00:41:01.770 --> 00:41:07.430
They'd be talking about things--
global crises-- right-- or just

00:41:07.430 --> 00:41:10.390
world events.

00:41:10.390 --> 00:41:13.135
And I was suddenly
like, where is that?

00:41:13.135 --> 00:41:15.860
Oh-- no-- uh-- and
I'm like, fuck.

00:41:15.860 --> 00:41:18.307
What are these-- and
not to mention the fact

00:41:18.307 --> 00:41:19.890
that most of them
were speaking, like,

00:41:19.890 --> 00:41:23.040
two or three different
languages and speaking

00:41:23.040 --> 00:41:28.096
in English for my sake, right?

00:41:28.096 --> 00:41:29.470
Or we could all
speak Portuguese.

00:41:32.390 --> 00:41:35.300
So I suddenly had this
insight into-- because I

00:41:35.300 --> 00:41:36.280
was a good student.

00:41:36.280 --> 00:41:38.780
But I realized that regardless
of how good of a student

00:41:38.780 --> 00:41:41.950
I was, what I was learning
in the American system

00:41:41.950 --> 00:41:43.510
was not really
preparing me to sit

00:41:43.510 --> 00:41:46.700
at a table with a bunch
of other 16-year-old kids

00:41:46.700 --> 00:41:50.960
from around the world and
not feel like a total fucking

00:41:50.960 --> 00:41:54.719
ignoramus, just
like nothing to say.

00:41:54.719 --> 00:41:56.760
You know, like, have you
heard the new Kanye yet?

00:41:56.760 --> 00:41:57.259
[LAUGHTER]

00:41:57.259 --> 00:42:01.380
Like I just-- I had nothing
to contribute, you know?

00:42:01.380 --> 00:42:04.250
I could talk about-- I--
because my family was activists,

00:42:04.250 --> 00:42:06.500
I could talk about what was
happening in South Africa.

00:42:06.500 --> 00:42:09.170
And that was funny--
not funny, but it

00:42:09.170 --> 00:42:12.740
was funny because there
was an Afrikaner kid there

00:42:12.740 --> 00:42:17.400
who was in total
denial and had no idea

00:42:17.400 --> 00:42:19.837
what was going on in the
country where he was from.

00:42:19.837 --> 00:42:21.670
And so I was like, what
about the 4,000 kids

00:42:21.670 --> 00:42:22.470
being held in detention?

00:42:22.470 --> 00:42:24.230
I knew because my
sister was an activist.

00:42:24.230 --> 00:42:25.730
And we had been
boycotting companies

00:42:25.730 --> 00:42:29.191
like Coca Cola and all the
shit in my house in New York.

00:42:29.191 --> 00:42:31.440
And he was like, there are
no kids being held in-- no,

00:42:31.440 --> 00:42:34.516
the blacks are treated
fairly in South Africa, which

00:42:34.516 --> 00:42:35.890
reminded me of a
lot of Americans

00:42:35.890 --> 00:42:38.100
I see abroad who are totally
unaware of what's actually

00:42:38.100 --> 00:42:38.725
happening here.

00:42:38.725 --> 00:42:46.399
So that's a long form
answer of what I picked up.

00:42:46.399 --> 00:42:48.815
JOSH: We could probably go a
while on that one just alone.

00:42:48.815 --> 00:42:50.630
[LAUGHTER]

00:42:50.630 --> 00:42:53.040
So as much as people were
flocking around you asking you

00:42:53.040 --> 00:42:54.700
questions when you
were in Brazil,

00:42:54.700 --> 00:42:56.140
I think there is probably
some Googlers here

00:42:56.140 --> 00:42:57.085
who might have some questions.

00:42:57.085 --> 00:42:57.550
SAUL WILLIAMS: Let's do it.

00:42:57.550 --> 00:42:59.760
JOSH: So we have some
mics here on the side

00:42:59.760 --> 00:43:00.915
if we do have any questions
from the audience--

00:43:00.915 --> 00:43:02.790
SAUL WILLIAMS: I'm going
to steal some water.

00:43:02.790 --> 00:43:04.810
JOSH: --please step up.

00:43:04.810 --> 00:43:08.030
And also, just so you're aware,
we have some books in the back.

00:43:08.030 --> 00:43:10.529
We have also a handful
of vinyl records.

00:43:10.529 --> 00:43:12.070
So if you have a
turntable and you're

00:43:12.070 --> 00:43:14.556
going to listen to the
record, please pick one up.

00:43:14.556 --> 00:43:15.392
OK.

00:43:15.392 --> 00:43:18.480
AUDIENCE: How's it going?

00:43:18.480 --> 00:43:18.980
Super.

00:43:18.980 --> 00:43:19.390
[LAUGHTER]

00:43:19.390 --> 00:43:20.473
SAUL WILLIAMS: [INAUDIBLE]

00:43:20.473 --> 00:43:23.640
AUDIENCE: So I wanted to talk
a little bit about when you--

00:43:23.640 --> 00:43:25.650
so the first time
I discovered you

00:43:25.650 --> 00:43:27.630
was from the Nike commercial.

00:43:27.630 --> 00:43:30.000
And I was like, this
is an amazing song.

00:43:30.000 --> 00:43:31.910
You know, I need to
find out who this is.

00:43:31.910 --> 00:43:33.840
And so it was
"Lists of Demands."

00:43:33.840 --> 00:43:36.290
And I'm just curious
how you feel.

00:43:36.290 --> 00:43:39.040
Like, I'm obviously getting--
I don't know you that well,

00:43:39.040 --> 00:43:41.990
but I definitely get kind of a
little bit of like a subculture

00:43:41.990 --> 00:43:44.205
and not really trying
to be mainstream--

00:43:44.205 --> 00:43:46.540
how you kind of find-- you
know, would you participate

00:43:46.540 --> 00:43:47.890
in additional commercials?

00:43:47.890 --> 00:43:51.200
How do you kind of feel
about that looking back?

00:43:51.200 --> 00:43:54.687
And just about
commercialism and, you know,

00:43:54.687 --> 00:43:56.020
how you get yourself out there--

00:43:56.020 --> 00:43:56.310
SAUL WILLIAMS: Sure.

00:43:56.310 --> 00:43:57.300
AUDIENCE: I never would
have discovered you

00:43:57.300 --> 00:43:59.424
if I hadn't heard you on
the commercial-- just kind

00:43:59.424 --> 00:44:00.590
of the juxtaposition.

00:44:00.590 --> 00:44:01.689
SAUL WILLIAMS: Well, cool.

00:44:01.689 --> 00:44:03.480
It's true that I'm
really into subcultures.

00:44:03.480 --> 00:44:07.050
It's not true that I have no
interest in the mainstream.

00:44:07.050 --> 00:44:10.904
I'm interested in shifting
what the mainstream is about.

00:44:10.904 --> 00:44:12.820
And through observation,
I realize that things

00:44:12.820 --> 00:44:14.410
go in cycles, you know?

00:44:14.410 --> 00:44:16.560
Like what's has
been of interest to

00:44:16.560 --> 00:44:20.360
me is taking periphery
ideas and periphery arts

00:44:20.360 --> 00:44:22.750
and seeing how far I can push
them into the mainstream.

00:44:22.750 --> 00:44:25.530
I mean, for example, most of you
guys have heard of slam poetry

00:44:25.530 --> 00:44:26.800
at this point.

00:44:26.800 --> 00:44:29.605
And in 1996 when I first
started participating in that

00:44:29.605 --> 00:44:31.700
and '98 when I came out
with my film "Slam,"

00:44:31.700 --> 00:44:34.300
the idea was not to
avoid the mainstream.

00:44:34.300 --> 00:44:38.880
It was to take these ideas
and these poems and say,

00:44:38.880 --> 00:44:41.860
what happens if this is
the type of shit that

00:44:41.860 --> 00:44:43.610
becomes the mainstream?

00:44:43.610 --> 00:44:46.250
So I've been more aligned
with the idea of how do

00:44:46.250 --> 00:44:49.340
we re-envision the mainstream?

00:44:49.340 --> 00:44:52.520
Because like anybody else,
I sit back and go, wow,

00:44:52.520 --> 00:44:55.530
Jimi Hendrix was
once mainstream.

00:44:55.530 --> 00:44:58.660
Bob Dylan was once mainstream.

00:44:58.660 --> 00:45:00.690
That shit was mainstream.

00:45:00.690 --> 00:45:02.670
When can that happen again?

00:45:02.670 --> 00:45:06.700
You know, so it's really about
pushing the mainstream so that

00:45:06.700 --> 00:45:09.360
basically what I
discovered early on way

00:45:09.360 --> 00:45:12.140
before the Nike
commercial-- because I

00:45:12.140 --> 00:45:13.820
wrote that song in 2004.

00:45:13.820 --> 00:45:18.350
That Nike commercial
came out in 2008--

00:45:18.350 --> 00:45:22.400
was that if I-- so
that I basically

00:45:22.400 --> 00:45:25.480
started dealing with
thinking of poetry

00:45:25.480 --> 00:45:30.670
as coding and thinking
of how could I

00:45:30.670 --> 00:45:36.410
embed my work with something
so that regardless of how

00:45:36.410 --> 00:45:41.250
you encountered it,
you would walk away

00:45:41.250 --> 00:45:44.101
with those things that made
you go look it up and go, ooh,

00:45:44.101 --> 00:45:44.850
what's that about?

00:45:44.850 --> 00:45:46.141
I want to-- da-da-da, you know?

00:45:46.141 --> 00:45:50.380
Which is why I've never had any
issues about my music appearing

00:45:50.380 --> 00:45:51.810
in any commercial or whatever.

00:45:51.810 --> 00:45:53.830
As I said at the time when
I was confronted about it,

00:45:53.830 --> 00:45:56.300
I was like, I don't really feel
like I did a Nike commercial.

00:45:56.300 --> 00:45:58.383
I feel like Nike just a
Saul Williams commercial--

00:45:58.383 --> 00:45:59.611
[LAUGHTER]

00:45:59.611 --> 00:46:00.110
--you know?

00:46:00.110 --> 00:46:00.930
[APPLAUSE]

00:46:00.930 --> 00:46:02.160
Yeah.

00:46:02.160 --> 00:46:03.250
That was the idea.

00:46:03.250 --> 00:46:05.484
Because I essentially
felt like, it's not

00:46:05.484 --> 00:46:07.400
like you watch the
commercial and you're like,

00:46:07.400 --> 00:46:10.734
oh my God, I got to get
those shoes, you know?

00:46:10.734 --> 00:46:12.150
Like good luck
selling your shoes.

00:46:12.150 --> 00:46:14.590
We all buy that
shit anyway, right?

00:46:14.590 --> 00:46:16.030
We all buy it anyway.

00:46:16.030 --> 00:46:20.890
But you would watch it
and go, what is that song?

00:46:20.890 --> 00:46:22.160
What is that?

00:46:22.160 --> 00:46:25.430
And that wormhole that that
would lead you through,

00:46:25.430 --> 00:46:30.930
through poets, other writers,
other references-- before you

00:46:30.930 --> 00:46:33.680
know it, you're
in the subculture

00:46:33.680 --> 00:46:35.830
that I've been trying
to introduce you to,

00:46:35.830 --> 00:46:38.340
which has to do with the
collection of amazing artists,

00:46:38.340 --> 00:46:40.090
and friends, and all
the things that we're

00:46:40.090 --> 00:46:42.390
talking about-- diversity,
intersectionality

00:46:42.390 --> 00:46:45.560
is the shit that was happening
in the open mics in the '90s.

00:46:45.560 --> 00:46:46.780
You're welcome.

00:46:46.780 --> 00:46:49.080
You understand what I'm saying?

00:46:49.080 --> 00:46:51.090
Essentially, that's
been the plan--

00:46:51.090 --> 00:46:56.350
is how do we embed our work
with the type of shit that makes

00:46:56.350 --> 00:46:59.080
these guys at Wieden+Kennedy
or whatever go,

00:46:59.080 --> 00:47:00.430
the song is really cool?

00:47:00.430 --> 00:47:02.520
[LAUGHTER]

00:47:02.520 --> 00:47:04.910
Glad you like it.

00:47:04.910 --> 00:47:07.840
Because also here, we need
to eat and all that shit.

00:47:07.840 --> 00:47:10.990
I mean, and my
background is in theater.

00:47:10.990 --> 00:47:13.330
I started writing poetry
when I was in the grad acting

00:47:13.330 --> 00:47:14.630
program at NYU.

00:47:14.630 --> 00:47:16.500
I've never been like,
oh my God, I don't

00:47:16.500 --> 00:47:18.425
want to be in the mainstream.

00:47:18.425 --> 00:47:20.550
I've just looked at a lot
of shit in the mainstream

00:47:20.550 --> 00:47:24.540
and been like, that's corny
as fuck, or worse yet,

00:47:24.540 --> 00:47:26.550
that's negligent.

00:47:26.550 --> 00:47:28.894
Why would you put that
message out there?

00:47:28.894 --> 00:47:29.810
Why would you do that?

00:47:29.810 --> 00:47:32.530
So when I had the opportunity
to write my first film

00:47:32.530 --> 00:47:36.500
and act in it, which was
my thesis project at NYU,

00:47:36.500 --> 00:47:40.350
the film "Slam,"
my first thought

00:47:40.350 --> 00:47:44.400
was, OK, more than
likely, this is

00:47:44.400 --> 00:47:46.010
going to reach the mainstream.

00:47:46.010 --> 00:47:48.930
What do I want to put out there?

00:47:48.930 --> 00:47:51.050
So every little
message, every idea,

00:47:51.050 --> 00:47:53.019
every t-shirt I'm
wearing, all this is like,

00:47:53.019 --> 00:47:54.560
let's put the shit
in the mainstream.

00:47:54.560 --> 00:47:56.320
Let's see if we can get
that in the mainstream.

00:47:56.320 --> 00:47:57.700
When I had the
opportunity after that

00:47:57.700 --> 00:47:59.270
to do my first album
with Rick Rubin,

00:47:59.270 --> 00:48:01.950
"Amethyst Rock Star," the
idea was the same thing.

00:48:01.950 --> 00:48:03.650
It was just like,
OK, it's Rick Rubin.

00:48:03.650 --> 00:48:05.240
This might reach the mainstream.

00:48:05.240 --> 00:48:11.170
It's never been about the idea
of, like, avoid the mainstream.

00:48:11.170 --> 00:48:16.130
Avoid conforming to
the idea of the fact

00:48:16.130 --> 00:48:18.920
that you would think that
you need to conform in order

00:48:18.920 --> 00:48:21.210
to reach it.

00:48:21.210 --> 00:48:24.210
That's what I'm
avoiding is conforming,

00:48:24.210 --> 00:48:27.830
not progressing and
evolving on ideas,

00:48:27.830 --> 00:48:32.100
but conforming for the sake
of reaching the mainstream.

00:48:32.100 --> 00:48:33.840
That is what I'm against.

00:48:33.840 --> 00:48:36.808
That's what's whacked
to me, you know?

00:48:36.808 --> 00:48:39.400
AUDIENCE: Cool.

00:48:39.400 --> 00:48:39.910
Thanks.

00:48:39.910 --> 00:48:41.493
AUDIENCE: So in a
lot of your travels,

00:48:41.493 --> 00:48:43.020
you've been throughout Europe.

00:48:43.020 --> 00:48:46.030
I know you just mentioned
you just got back.

00:48:46.030 --> 00:48:47.780
What you're starting
to see a lot of times

00:48:47.780 --> 00:48:52.800
is free speech coming
under a lot of pressure.

00:48:52.800 --> 00:48:55.610
And you see cartoonists
or journalists

00:48:55.610 --> 00:48:58.150
who are being persecuted
against or silenced.

00:48:58.150 --> 00:49:01.110
And I was wondering, have you
as an artist and an activist,

00:49:01.110 --> 00:49:03.880
have you ever been tempted
to be silenced or even

00:49:03.880 --> 00:49:07.190
successfully silenced on
a certain topic or area?

00:49:07.190 --> 00:49:10.234
And I was wondering if you could
talk a little more on that.

00:49:10.234 --> 00:49:12.650
SAUL WILLIAMS: The only is
silencing that I've experienced

00:49:12.650 --> 00:49:14.810
is whatever silencing
occurs that makes

00:49:14.810 --> 00:49:19.280
some of you in this room
not hear of me until today.

00:49:19.280 --> 00:49:20.990
My work has been in
enough platforms.

00:49:20.990 --> 00:49:23.940
But there are those who
hear my work and go,

00:49:23.940 --> 00:49:28.320
maybe not this platform--
[LAUGHTER] --you know?

00:49:28.320 --> 00:49:30.860
Otherwise, I
can't-- I mean, yes.

00:49:30.860 --> 00:49:32.960
There's always been
moments like for example,

00:49:32.960 --> 00:49:34.400
here's a funny back story.

00:49:34.400 --> 00:49:37.540
The idea for
"MartyrLoserKing" actually

00:49:37.540 --> 00:49:42.880
came about when
Nickelodeon asked me

00:49:42.880 --> 00:49:45.851
if I could write a few poems
for Black History Month.

00:49:45.851 --> 00:49:51.900
[LAUGHTER] And I wrote--
and some of those poems

00:49:51.900 --> 00:49:54.780
are in the book "USA"
actually, right?

00:49:54.780 --> 00:49:59.514
And one of the
poems I had written

00:49:59.514 --> 00:50:00.930
after hearing
someone mispronounce

00:50:00.930 --> 00:50:05.670
the name Martin Luther King,
a francophone person, was I

00:50:05.670 --> 00:50:08.204
started writing
this poem thinking

00:50:08.204 --> 00:50:10.120
about a kid who comes
home from school like, I

00:50:10.120 --> 00:50:13.100
heard about this great guy
today named Martyr Loser King,

00:50:13.100 --> 00:50:13.600
you know?

00:50:13.600 --> 00:50:18.350
And talking about-- and
he wanted to name his dog

00:50:18.350 --> 00:50:19.930
that, right?

00:50:19.930 --> 00:50:27.400
And Nickelodeon was like,
this is not going to work.

00:50:27.400 --> 00:50:30.220
[LAUGHTER]

00:50:30.220 --> 00:50:31.470
I didn't feel silenced.

00:50:31.470 --> 00:50:32.920
I knew I was pushing it anyway.

00:50:32.920 --> 00:50:33.810
That's what I meant.

00:50:33.810 --> 00:50:36.770
I'm trying to push and see,
like, well, how far can we go?

00:50:36.770 --> 00:50:37.560
JOSH: Hm.

00:50:37.560 --> 00:50:40.220
SAUL WILLIAMS: How far
can we go, you know?

00:50:40.220 --> 00:50:47.060
But I don't-- I can't say that
I have felt silenced by certain

00:50:47.060 --> 00:50:47.560
forces.

00:50:47.560 --> 00:50:50.300
But of course, you know,
there's-- I walk into tons

00:50:50.300 --> 00:50:52.390
of places that are like--
I mean, because for me,

00:50:52.390 --> 00:50:54.620
it's the most
minimalistic thing.

00:50:54.620 --> 00:50:58.630
If I'm on the radio
where I can't curse,

00:50:58.630 --> 00:51:00.641
I already feel silenced.

00:51:00.641 --> 00:51:02.390
You know, I'm already
like what the fuck--

00:51:02.390 --> 00:51:04.160
[LAUGHTER]

00:51:04.160 --> 00:51:04.900
--you know?

00:51:04.900 --> 00:51:06.230
Like what year is this?

00:51:06.230 --> 00:51:08.050
What's up with our--
you know, because you

00:51:08.050 --> 00:51:09.930
go to Europe for example.

00:51:09.930 --> 00:51:13.100
And you hear all of the songs
that's on American radio

00:51:13.100 --> 00:51:15.300
without any of the
beeps or whatever.

00:51:15.300 --> 00:51:18.144
And you're just like, oh,
that's what they're saying.

00:51:18.144 --> 00:51:19.560
I mean, you knew
it, but you never

00:51:19.560 --> 00:51:22.550
heard them say it before
unless you were in a club.

00:51:22.550 --> 00:51:24.030
But it's all on the radio there.

00:51:24.030 --> 00:51:26.620
And it's all like, nigger,
ass, ho, bitch, ba-da-ba-da-ba.

00:51:26.620 --> 00:51:28.720
And you're like, fucking hell.

00:51:28.720 --> 00:51:30.785
And the kids are like,
I love American music--

00:51:30.785 --> 00:51:31.600
[LAUGHTER]

00:51:31.600 --> 00:51:32.171
--you know?

00:51:32.171 --> 00:51:34.880
[LAUGHTER]

00:51:34.880 --> 00:51:39.090
But they don't have the same
Puritan strain as us, you know?

00:51:39.090 --> 00:51:43.970
And I think that gets in the way
of moving the dialogue forward.

00:51:43.970 --> 00:51:46.060
And I'm not the first
to have that complaint.

00:51:46.060 --> 00:51:49.290
I mean, Allen Ginsberg
said a great deal

00:51:49.290 --> 00:51:53.970
about that same sort of
censorship that he encountered.

00:51:53.970 --> 00:51:56.780
But no, I can't say
that I feel silenced.

00:51:56.780 --> 00:52:02.750
But like I said, I do feel
like some people might

00:52:02.750 --> 00:52:05.020
be afraid, or corporations,
or whatever might

00:52:05.020 --> 00:52:06.150
be afraid to work with me.

00:52:06.150 --> 00:52:09.610
But I've never been, like--
I have to make it clear.

00:52:09.610 --> 00:52:12.070
I've never really been
afraid of corporate culture.

00:52:12.070 --> 00:52:15.810
Like, "Slam" came out
through dry Trimark Cinema.

00:52:15.810 --> 00:52:19.130
I have five books that came out
through MTV Books, you know?

00:52:19.130 --> 00:52:21.260
My albums have come out
through Sony and all that.

00:52:21.260 --> 00:52:26.900
No, I'm an independent artist
here because of who I am.

00:52:26.900 --> 00:52:28.840
I'm an independent artist.

00:52:28.840 --> 00:52:31.410
But I interact with these
motherfuckers all the time.

00:52:31.410 --> 00:52:32.970
I love playing with the sharks.

00:52:32.970 --> 00:52:33.530
It's fun.

00:52:33.530 --> 00:52:34.344
[LAUGHTER]

00:52:34.344 --> 00:52:35.929
You know, it's fun.

00:52:35.929 --> 00:52:37.720
JOSH: All right, well,
speaking of silence,

00:52:37.720 --> 00:52:39.020
I think we only have just
a couple of minutes left.

00:52:39.020 --> 00:52:41.980
I think we might have time for
one more question. [INAUDIBLE]

00:52:41.980 --> 00:52:44.226
AUDIENCE: So speaking
of playing with sharks,

00:52:44.226 --> 00:52:45.350
where do you draw the line?

00:52:45.350 --> 00:52:48.760
Or is there a line for folks you
wouldn't work with, or interact

00:52:48.760 --> 00:52:49.752
with, or entities--

00:52:49.752 --> 00:52:50.180
SAUL WILLIAMS: Oh, certainly.

00:52:50.180 --> 00:52:51.180
AUDIENCE: --you woudn't?

00:52:51.180 --> 00:52:52.620
I was curious what that line is.

00:52:52.620 --> 00:52:54.380
SAUL WILLIAMS: Right.

00:52:54.380 --> 00:52:58.290
Well, you know, I'm working on
this new program with Monsanto

00:52:58.290 --> 00:52:59.010
right now.

00:52:59.010 --> 00:53:00.150
I'm joking.

00:53:00.150 --> 00:53:03.650
[LAUGHTER]

00:53:06.500 --> 00:53:08.910
You know, I'm trying to
help Whole Foods find

00:53:08.910 --> 00:53:10.080
higher pricing--

00:53:10.080 --> 00:53:12.465
[LAUGHTER]

00:53:13.420 --> 00:53:16.180
--in poorer neighborhoods.

00:53:16.180 --> 00:53:16.680
No.

00:53:16.680 --> 00:53:20.180
I mean, I kind of
take it as it comes.

00:53:20.180 --> 00:53:21.676
I'm not sure, you know?

00:53:21.676 --> 00:53:25.780
Like I said, I make my
living writing poetry.

00:53:25.780 --> 00:53:29.230
I'm excited about
prospects of actually being

00:53:29.230 --> 00:53:31.300
able to earn occasionally.

00:53:31.300 --> 00:53:33.175
You know, like I'm
paid by stanza.

00:53:38.910 --> 00:53:43.605
I think I play it by ear it.

00:53:43.605 --> 00:53:46.430
It really-- I mean, I
have drawn lines before.

00:53:46.430 --> 00:53:50.470
I remember once, years
ago, being asked-- and then

00:53:50.470 --> 00:53:52.830
the other-- well, let
me finish that idea.

00:53:52.830 --> 00:53:55.080
I remember being asked
years ago to write

00:53:55.080 --> 00:54:01.220
a poem about a new Mercedes
for a Mercedes radio campaign.

00:54:01.220 --> 00:54:04.070
And I actually never
liked Mercedes.

00:54:04.070 --> 00:54:07.340
I was always-- as a kid, it was
like Michael, Prince, Mercedes,

00:54:07.340 --> 00:54:08.360
Volvo.

00:54:08.360 --> 00:54:10.580
And I was like Volvo.

00:54:10.580 --> 00:54:13.560
The more hardcore, warm
seats-- they're-- ooh.

00:54:13.560 --> 00:54:14.990
They're square.

00:54:14.990 --> 00:54:17.044
You know, I like Volvo.

00:54:17.044 --> 00:54:17.660
I don't know.

00:54:17.660 --> 00:54:19.250
So I was like, I'm not doing it.

00:54:19.250 --> 00:54:21.160
But then I did something
for Levi's, not

00:54:21.160 --> 00:54:23.240
write for-- and then the
other thing, like, even

00:54:23.240 --> 00:54:25.050
with the Nike
thing, I was like, I

00:54:25.050 --> 00:54:26.710
don't think I could
do it if they asked

00:54:26.710 --> 00:54:28.100
me to write something for it.

00:54:28.100 --> 00:54:33.630
But if you want to take one of
my existing works and apply it,

00:54:33.630 --> 00:54:36.170
I might be open, you know?

00:54:36.170 --> 00:54:40.081
And so that's-- so it always
depends on what it is,

00:54:40.081 --> 00:54:40.580
you know?

00:54:40.580 --> 00:54:43.150
Like there was a--
at one point, I

00:54:43.150 --> 00:54:46.010
was-- this was
before the "Holler

00:54:46.010 --> 00:54:47.420
if you Hear Me" play that I did.

00:54:47.420 --> 00:54:50.000
Years before that, I
was in communication

00:54:50.000 --> 00:54:52.640
with Tupac Shakur's
mom as she was

00:54:52.640 --> 00:54:55.060
planning something that
was kind of like "American

00:54:55.060 --> 00:54:57.630
Idol" with poetry.

00:54:57.630 --> 00:54:59.670
And it was going to
go across the states.

00:54:59.670 --> 00:55:01.150
And there were going were
going to be all these poets.

00:55:01.150 --> 00:55:02.090
And it was going
to be televised.

00:55:02.090 --> 00:55:03.910
But she was teaming
with Burger King.

00:55:03.910 --> 00:55:05.590
[LAUGHTER]

00:55:06.480 --> 00:55:08.440
And they wanted
me to be the host.

00:55:08.440 --> 00:55:11.320
And I had to be open to
the possibility of my poems

00:55:11.320 --> 00:55:13.490
being on the side
of Burger King,

00:55:13.490 --> 00:55:17.060
like, drinking containers.

00:55:17.060 --> 00:55:19.780
And I was like, that's
where I draw the line.

00:55:19.780 --> 00:55:22.710
[LAUGHTER]

00:55:23.210 --> 00:55:26.620
I just coudln't-- I couldn't--
I just couldn't imagine.

00:55:26.620 --> 00:55:28.360
I was like, no,
that's just not cool.

00:55:28.360 --> 00:55:30.520
So it's just-- it depends.

00:55:30.520 --> 00:55:32.530
It really depends, you know?

00:55:32.530 --> 00:55:34.200
But I actually have
done a lot of stuff

00:55:34.200 --> 00:55:35.455
where I'm like, that's cool.

00:55:35.455 --> 00:55:37.010
You know, it works.

00:55:37.010 --> 00:55:39.260
The most surprising
thing for me and I

00:55:39.260 --> 00:55:42.430
guess the freest
form of interaction

00:55:42.430 --> 00:55:46.490
with the corporate world for me
has come in the sports world.

00:55:46.490 --> 00:55:48.280
Because as I'm making
this stuff, like,

00:55:48.280 --> 00:55:50.910
for the revolution,
other people are like,

00:55:50.910 --> 00:55:52.540
your music's really
great to run to--

00:55:52.540 --> 00:55:54.060
[LAUGHTER]

00:55:54.060 --> 00:55:54.560
--you know?

00:55:54.560 --> 00:55:56.760
It's great for working-- I
meet football players who

00:55:56.760 --> 00:55:57.640
are like, yo, man.

00:55:57.640 --> 00:55:59.010
We work out to your shit, man.

00:55:59.010 --> 00:55:59.510
[LAUGHTER]

00:55:59.510 --> 00:56:02.350
I'm like, oh, I didn't
think about that, you know?

00:56:02.350 --> 00:56:04.950
And so I've done tons
of stuff with, like,

00:56:04.950 --> 00:56:07.930
Nike, Puma, like with
Adidas, with all this shit.

00:56:07.930 --> 00:56:08.850
I'm like, oh, wow.

00:56:08.850 --> 00:56:10.210
I didn't think about sports.

00:56:10.210 --> 00:56:12.110
And I'm always open to
that shit, you know?

00:56:12.110 --> 00:56:15.336
So it depends.

00:56:15.336 --> 00:56:16.850
JOSH: Well, I think
we're over time.

00:56:16.850 --> 00:56:17.130
I think--

00:56:17.130 --> 00:56:17.680
SAUL WILLIAMS: Sorry.

00:56:17.680 --> 00:56:18.700
I knew it was going to happen.

00:56:18.700 --> 00:56:19.900
JOSH: We reached the end.

00:56:19.900 --> 00:56:21.830
But it has been a
fascinating talk.

00:56:21.830 --> 00:56:23.330
And your performance
was incredible.

00:56:23.330 --> 00:56:25.890
And we're so glad that we have
some records and some books

00:56:25.890 --> 00:56:26.990
to give out to Googlers.

00:56:26.990 --> 00:56:28.520
Would you might sticking around
just for a few minutes as well?

00:56:28.520 --> 00:56:29.210
SAUL WILLIAMS: Ah, I'm fine.

00:56:29.210 --> 00:56:29.530
I'm here.

00:56:29.530 --> 00:56:29.600
JOSH: Awesome.

00:56:29.600 --> 00:56:30.010
SAUL WILLIAMS: Cool.

00:56:30.010 --> 00:56:30.720
JOSH: All right,
aren't well again,

00:56:30.720 --> 00:56:33.075
thanks Saul Williams for
joining us at Google.

00:56:33.075 --> 00:56:34.177
[APPLAUSE]

00:56:34.177 --> 00:56:36.010
SAUL WILLIAMS: Thank
you guys for having me.
