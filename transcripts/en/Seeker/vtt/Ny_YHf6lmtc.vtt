00:00:00.320 --> 00:00:04.800
If a body is found in a field, and the cops
suspect foul play is involved, establishing

00:00:04.800 --> 00:00:07.440
the exact time of death is critical.

00:00:07.440 --> 00:00:11.049
Figuring out the deceased’s final moments
can help investigators corroborate people’s

00:00:11.049 --> 00:00:13.790
stories to ultimately hone in on the killer.

00:00:13.790 --> 00:00:14.790
But how do you do that?

00:00:14.790 --> 00:00:18.250
There are a few traditional ways to tell when
someone died.

00:00:18.250 --> 00:00:23.010
Forensic examiners can measure body temperature,
skin color, and degree of rigor mortis.

00:00:23.010 --> 00:00:27.789
Each of these changes as the body begins decomposing,
so knowing the stage of change they can work

00:00:27.789 --> 00:00:30.089
backwards to figure out the time of death.

00:00:30.089 --> 00:00:35.360
But all those methods only really work in
the first 72 hours; any longer and those factors

00:00:35.360 --> 00:00:38.720
have piqued, meaning the changes have happened
and there’s no more data to glean.

00:00:38.720 --> 00:00:43.110
So, when a body has been a corpse for more
than three days, investigators have to use

00:00:43.110 --> 00:00:47.840
other methods to determine the time of death…
one way is to look at all the different insects

00:00:47.840 --> 00:00:49.720
that feed on dead human flesh.

00:00:49.720 --> 00:00:50.879
*gross sound*

00:00:50.879 --> 00:00:55.210
Insects are drawn to the gasses and fluids
released from a decomposing body; to them,

00:00:55.210 --> 00:00:57.850
it’s fertile ground to lay their eggs and
cultivate their young.

00:00:57.850 --> 00:01:02.090
*disgust face* The first insect to reach a
corpse is usually a blowfly, which will lay

00:01:02.090 --> 00:01:04.800
eggs within two days of the person’s death.

00:01:04.800 --> 00:01:08.380
Flesh flies also move in early in the decaying
process.

00:01:08.380 --> 00:01:11.870
Decomposing body fat attracts hide beetles
and pyralid moths.

00:01:11.870 --> 00:01:16.290
As time go by and flesh breaks down, other
species of flies and beetles that have mouths

00:01:16.290 --> 00:01:20.060
to chew tougher food move in, consuming that
dead flesh.

00:01:20.060 --> 00:01:24.509
From there, the corpse becomes an ecosystem
with insects feeding on the corpse also feeding

00:01:24.509 --> 00:01:25.509
on each other.

00:01:25.509 --> 00:01:28.759
This is all super gross but super important.

00:01:28.759 --> 00:01:32.659
Entomologists know the life cycles of these
insects, specifically the all-important blowfly

00:01:32.659 --> 00:01:35.450
that lays its eggs in the dead body first.

00:01:35.450 --> 00:01:38.900
When determining time of death, they can look
at the stage of development of the blowfly

00:01:38.900 --> 00:01:43.630
— whether it’s an egg, larva, pupa, or
adult — and take into account environmental

00:01:43.630 --> 00:01:48.140
factors like heat and insect patterns to work
backwards and figure out approximately when

00:01:48.140 --> 00:01:51.350
the blowfly laid its eggs, which can tell
them the time of death.

00:01:51.350 --> 00:01:55.520
We’re really good at this, but there’s
a problem… we need to know exactly what

00:01:55.520 --> 00:01:57.250
species that larva is.

00:01:57.250 --> 00:01:59.210
And they all sort of look alike.

00:01:59.210 --> 00:02:03.520
The examiner needs to know the species for
a better estimation of development time and

00:02:03.520 --> 00:02:04.530
time of death.

00:02:04.530 --> 00:02:07.759
They can do a DNA test on an egg, but that
can be pricey.

00:02:07.759 --> 00:02:11.800
The cheaper option is to collect the egg and
let it grow to adulthood in a lab to figure

00:02:11.800 --> 00:02:13.790
out the species, and work backwards from there.

00:02:13.790 --> 00:02:17.750
Of course, if you’re trying to find out
who killed someone and left them in a field…

00:02:17.750 --> 00:02:22.170
waiting three or so days for a fly egg to
become a fully-formed insect is stressful.

00:02:22.170 --> 00:02:24.970
A criminal can flee to a new country by then!

00:02:24.970 --> 00:02:29.250
Knowing the egg-identification thing is an
issue, an organic chemist teamed up with a

00:02:29.250 --> 00:02:33.470
forensic entomologist to apply real-time mass
spectrometry to blowfly eggs.

00:02:33.470 --> 00:02:36.560
And it could be a game changer to forensic
science.

00:02:36.560 --> 00:02:40.520
Before we get to that though, they had to
learn about all these species of flies.

00:02:40.520 --> 00:02:44.790
To do that, the researchers put pork liver
in traps hidden around Manhattan.

00:02:44.790 --> 00:02:46.530
This is real science.

00:02:46.530 --> 00:02:51.630
They attracted four species of blowfly, and
trapped them before they laid their eggs.

00:02:51.630 --> 00:02:55.780
They determined their species and then put
them on a fresh liver to seed with their spawn.

00:02:55.780 --> 00:02:59.870
That way they knew what species were laying
eggs where.

00:02:59.870 --> 00:03:04.390
Then they collected the eggs and tested each
in a mass spectrometer to get a chemical fingerprint.

00:03:04.390 --> 00:03:08.850
Mass spectrometry is really complicated to
explain, but basically: a sample is ionized,

00:03:08.850 --> 00:03:13.870
the atoms are sorted by mass and charge and
it gives you a graph that looks like this.

00:03:13.870 --> 00:03:18.400
With this we can figure out what atoms something
is made of, what they call the chemical fingerprint.

00:03:18.400 --> 00:03:22.500
And since everything is made of atoms, we
can apply this technology to things like uncovering

00:03:22.500 --> 00:03:24.860
the amino acids in blowfly eggs!

00:03:24.860 --> 00:03:28.620
Knowing the species then analyzing the eggs
gave them the first ever chemically-based

00:03:28.620 --> 00:03:32.400
way to identify blowfly eggs, and it only
takes minutes to do it!

00:03:32.400 --> 00:03:36.410
Ideally, if this tech works, entomologists
can use all the data from the crime scene

00:03:36.410 --> 00:03:40.840
and a quick mass spectrometry check of the
fly larvae to find an approximate time of

00:03:40.840 --> 00:03:41.840
death.

00:03:41.840 --> 00:03:43.930
But, we can’t use this to catch criminals
yet.

00:03:43.930 --> 00:03:47.260
Scientists will need to measure the chemical
signature of more species, and then create

00:03:47.260 --> 00:03:52.150
a database against which spectra of unknown
eggs can be compared.This promises to advance

00:03:52.150 --> 00:03:56.700
forensic entomology, and by extension help
investigators act quickly when faced with

00:03:56.700 --> 00:03:58.300
a dead body in a field.

00:03:58.300 --> 00:04:02.320
But let’s say no one found the body in the
field until it was picked clean by insects…

00:04:02.320 --> 00:04:05.600
then forensic examiners have to figure out
what happened using just a skull!

00:04:05.600 --> 00:04:08.400
I talk about that in this episode right here.

00:04:08.400 --> 00:04:10.570
Did you make it through this video without
vomiting?

00:04:10.570 --> 00:04:11.830
I almost didn’t.
