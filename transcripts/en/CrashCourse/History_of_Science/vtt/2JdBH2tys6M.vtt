00:00:05.390 --> 00:00:09.790
What makes beer? Single-celled organisms.
What makes us cough and feel like sleeping

00:00:09.790 --> 00:00:15.830
for twelve straight hours Straight? Single-celled organisms. AKA microbes, germs, the tiny machines

00:00:15.830 --> 00:00:23.439
that allow us to digest—and can kill us.
“What is life?” Turns out, life is relentless,

00:00:23.440 --> 00:00:24.640
everywhere on earth!

00:00:24.640 --> 00:00:33.180
[Intro Music Plays]

00:00:33.180 --> 00:00:36.140
Microbes are invisible: they’re single cells.

00:00:36.150 --> 00:00:41.079
So to understand microbes—that is, to do
microbiology—scientists first needed to

00:00:41.079 --> 00:00:42.550
study cells.

00:00:42.550 --> 00:00:46.519
German botanist Matthias Schleiden and physiologist Theodor Schwann

00:00:46.519 --> 00:00:51.399
proposed a modern
cell theory around 1837: every living thing

00:00:51.399 --> 00:00:56.650
is made up of one or more cells. So the cell
was the fundamental unit of life, the thing

00:00:56.650 --> 00:01:02.399
that gives structure to all forms of life.
Amazingly, Schleiden—who studied plants—and

00:01:02.399 --> 00:01:07.350
Schwann—who studied animals—both noticed
tiny dots in the middles of the cells they

00:01:07.350 --> 00:01:14.460
looked at under their microscopes. These nuclei
must somehow be important to all life, they figured—correctly.

00:01:14.460 --> 00:01:17.700
Darwin’s chief public defender, Thomas Henry

00:01:17.700 --> 00:01:21.920
Huxley, also wrote a article called “The
Cell–Theory” in 1853.

00:01:21.920 --> 00:01:27.750
Where the Germans were cataloging different
microscopic forms, Huxley proposed a mechanistic

00:01:27.750 --> 00:01:32.411
model: cells are little factories with different
parts that have different functions. Their

00:01:32.411 --> 00:01:36.170
functions make the parts add up into an organic
whole.

00:01:36.170 --> 00:01:41.840
Not every scientist believed cell theory right
away, but many came around, as microscope-enabled

00:01:41.840 --> 00:01:43.040
evidence mounted.

00:01:43.040 --> 00:01:47.979
And yet, being able to observe single-celled
organisms didn’t immediately lead scientists

00:01:47.979 --> 00:01:52.100
to connect them to disease.
In fact, medicine in the early 1800s mostly

00:01:52.100 --> 00:01:57.110
worked the way it had hundreds or even a thousand
years earlier. It was still all about liquids

00:01:57.110 --> 00:02:00.409
called humors.
But some diseases were understood differently.

00:02:00.409 --> 00:02:05.780
These were caused by a kind of invisible badness
in the environment called a miasma.

00:02:05.780 --> 00:02:11.180
According to miasma theory, diseases were
caused by foul-smelling airs that came from

00:02:11.180 --> 00:02:14.720
rotting meats, swamps, and other putrefying
sources.

00:02:14.720 --> 00:02:19.610
Before you knock it, think about it: this
theory mostly works. Dangerous microbes grow

00:02:19.610 --> 00:02:25.680
on smelly, dirty stuff. The smell is a byproduct
of the microbes’ eating organic matter.

00:02:25.680 --> 00:02:30.450
But even today, we can’t see these microbes
without instruments. So following our unaided

00:02:30.450 --> 00:02:34.900
senses is still smart: don’t eat gross trash!

00:02:34.900 --> 00:02:38.940
Sniff the turkey before you eat it. And then, just eat it anyway like I did this morning.

00:02:38.960 --> 00:02:48.420
By the mid-1800s, however, a few scientific rebels were pushing a germ theory of disease.
This holds that germs, or pathogenic microorganisms,

00:02:48.440 --> 00:02:50.230
cause infectious diseases.
[Snow]

00:02:50.230 --> 00:02:53.629
Around this time, a nasty germ called Vibrio
cholerae provided

00:02:53.629 --> 00:02:58.141
an opportunity to test the theory out.h
Cholera had ravaged England since the germ

00:02:58.141 --> 00:03:02.680
started to travel widely out of south Asia
in the early 1800s, hitching rides on the

00:03:02.680 --> 00:03:08.060
expanding armada of merchant ships. Empire
had all kinds of unpredicted downsides.

00:03:08.060 --> 00:03:12.989
In 1854, a bad cholera epidemic hit Broad
Street in the Soho neighborhood of London,

00:03:12.989 --> 00:03:18.150
killing over six hundred people. One doctor
named John Snow had a hunch about what was

00:03:18.150 --> 00:03:21.010
going on.
Snow created a map of the outbreak and noted

00:03:21.010 --> 00:03:26.260
that the cases seemed to cluster around one
public well. He hypothesized that cholera

00:03:26.260 --> 00:03:31.430
microbes were rapidly multiplying in its water.
So he convinced the Soho council to remove

00:03:31.430 --> 00:03:36.409
the well’s pump handle. People went elsewhere
for water, and the cholera infections decreased.

00:03:36.409 --> 00:03:42.300
John Snow became a hero! Saving Lives! Even though, it turned out, the outbreak was already in decline when

00:03:42.300 --> 00:03:46.310
he removed the handle.
Thus proving that some John Snows, do know

00:03:46.310 --> 00:03:47.310
somethings.

00:03:47.310 --> 00:03:52.129
Snow’s quick thinking didn’t really prove
germ theory. For germs to replace miasmas

00:03:52.129 --> 00:03:57.720
in their minds, scientists would require a
better model of what germs are, and how they

00:03:57.720 --> 00:04:00.379
behave.
For that, we turn to one of the first experimental

00:04:00.379 --> 00:04:07.270
microbiologists and a dude whose name you
probably should know from milk labels: Louis Pasteur

00:04:07.270 --> 00:04:10.380
Born in France in 1822—the same year as

00:04:10.380 --> 00:04:16.079
Galton—Pasteur was a chemist, not a physician.
But he is known for his work on germs and

00:04:16.079 --> 00:04:19.310
health.
Pasteur is credited as the co-founder of microbiology

00:04:19.310 --> 00:04:24.450
and the founder of modern zymology,
the science of fermentation. Fermentation

00:04:24.450 --> 00:04:29.370
is the biological and chemical process needed
to make beer, wine, yogurt, cheese, bread,

00:04:29.370 --> 00:04:33.770
and many other foods.
ThoughtBubble, show us what that means.

00:04:33.770 --> 00:04:38.500
Chemically, fermentation is the conversion
of sugar molecules into ethanol, or alcohol,

00:04:38.500 --> 00:04:42.010
and carbon dioxide.
In food, this usually happens thanks to bacteria

00:04:42.010 --> 00:04:46.480
or yeast. Looking good, Saccharomyces!
Pasteur first connected yeast to the fermentation

00:04:46.480 --> 00:04:53.260
of wine in 1857. He observed that microscopic
yeast on grape skins makes grape juice ferment

00:04:53.260 --> 00:04:58.920
into wine. If you sterilize the skins, killing
the yeast, fermentation won’t happen.

00:04:58.920 --> 00:05:04.130
Pasteur even made the the analogy that the
microbes growing in wine and beer were similar

00:05:04.130 --> 00:05:09.380
to the microbes causing diseases in humans
and animals. He hypothesized that microbes

00:05:09.380 --> 00:05:14.970
are everywhere and must be responsible for
all kinds of phenomena, like making food spoil.

00:05:14.970 --> 00:05:20.360
So in 1865, he patented a process in which
liquids such as milk were heated to a temperature

00:05:20.360 --> 00:05:25.750
between sixty and one hundred degrees Celsius
in order to kill microbes. This became known

00:05:25.750 --> 00:05:29.580
as pasteurization.
It may sound kinda simple, but this was revolutionary!

00:05:29.580 --> 00:05:35.590
Earlier, Nicolas Appert had invented canning
to make foods safe, so Napoleon could fight

00:05:35.590 --> 00:05:41.010
wars for longer. But Pasteur’s method used
a lower temperature, thus preserving tastes

00:05:41.010 --> 00:05:43.920
and textures.
Related to this idea of killing bad germs,

00:05:43.920 --> 00:05:49.030
Pasteur also helped develop hygienic medical
practices, along with British surgeon Joseph

00:05:49.030 --> 00:05:54.280
Lister. No germs in the operating room!
Most importantly for the history of biology,

00:05:54.280 --> 00:05:59.090
Pasteur got tangled up in a debate with a
fellow scientist named Félix Pouchet

00:05:59.090 --> 00:06:04.280
who believed that living things spawn naturally
from certain environments. This widely held

00:06:04.280 --> 00:06:06.600
belief was called spontaneous generation.

00:06:06.600 --> 00:06:11.300
Pasteur, based on his observations of grapes,
reasoned that living things can only grow

00:06:11.300 --> 00:06:16.530
from other living things. So he created an
ingenious experiment to prove the theory of

00:06:16.530 --> 00:06:22.710
biogenesis, or life from life.
Pasteur showed that no germs would grow in

00:06:22.710 --> 00:06:27.810
sealed, sterilized long-necked flasks full
of beef broth. But in sterilized but open

00:06:27.810 --> 00:06:30.490
flasks, microbes would eventually show up.

00:06:30.490 --> 00:06:35.810
Thanks Thoughtbubble. After proving biogenesis,
in the 1870s, Pasteur worked on immunology

00:06:35.810 --> 00:06:40.800
and vaccination. Pasteur’s work with the
rabies and anthrax microbes supported the

00:06:40.800 --> 00:06:45.080
germ theory and its use in medicine: if you
could identify a microorganism, you could

00:06:45.080 --> 00:06:49.620
give someone a weakened version of it, or
vaccine, and the patient taking the vaccine

00:06:49.620 --> 00:06:56.380
would develop immunity to the real bug. And
in 1879, Pasteur developed the first lab-manufactured

00:06:56.380 --> 00:06:59.690
vaccine, for chicken cholera.
It was around this time that germ theory was

00:06:59.690 --> 00:07:03.100
finally widely accepted, in part due to Pasteur’s
work.

00:07:03.100 --> 00:07:07.550
But Pasteur’s ethics were questionable:
when rabies vaccines for humans rolled out,

00:07:07.550 --> 00:07:12.900
Pasteur kept his data on their effectiveness
secret. He even kept secret mortality data,

00:07:12.900 --> 00:07:17.800
or how many people his vaccines didn’t help.
So unlike today, in Pasteur’s time, it wasn’t

00:07:17.800 --> 00:07:21.520
necessarily a norm that useful medical research
should be shared publicly.

00:07:21.520 --> 00:07:23.990
But Pasteur was not the only notable germ

00:07:23.990 --> 00:07:29.050
wrangler. Born in 1843, the German physician
Robert Koch painstakingly worked

00:07:29.050 --> 00:07:33.650
at a microscope to definitively establish
the germ concept of disease.

00:07:33.650 --> 00:07:39.090
He identified different microbes, becoming
the leader of a large research team in Berlin.

00:07:39.090 --> 00:07:44.280
They founded the discipline of bacteriology,
or the study of bacteria, particularly in

00:07:44.280 --> 00:07:48.610
relation to human health.
In the late 1880s and ‘90s, Koch and his

00:07:48.610 --> 00:07:54.550
team traveled into areas experiencing epidemics,
including India and Egypt, to identify the

00:07:54.550 --> 00:08:00.750
microbes causing diseases there. By ID-ing
these microorganisms, they hoped to create

00:08:00.750 --> 00:08:03.770
vaccines.
First, Koch proved that the anthrax germ causes

00:08:03.770 --> 00:08:08.550
anthrax-the-disease. Later, he identified
the bacterium that causes tuberculosis or

00:08:08.550 --> 00:08:14.050
TB, which was a very widespread disease.
Koch also characterized cholera, vindicating

00:08:14.050 --> 00:08:18.440
the work of John Snow by showing that the
bacterium lives naturally in the small intestine

00:08:18.440 --> 00:08:24.680
of humans. Snow wasn’t just high on ether:
he’d correctly guessed how cholera spreads!

00:08:24.680 --> 00:08:28.940
Eventually, Koch’s team contributed to the
identification of the germs that causes diphtheria,

00:08:28.940 --> 00:08:34.580
typhoid, pneumonia, gonorrhea, meningitis,
whooping cough, tetanus, plague, leprosy,

00:08:34.580 --> 00:08:37.300
and syphilis.
…I would not want to borrow this dude’s

00:08:37.300 --> 00:08:38.600
lucky microscope!

00:08:38.600 --> 00:08:39.780
It's been through a lot!

00:08:39.780 --> 00:08:45.150
Through this work, Koch developed the four
postulates or steps for identifying infectious

00:08:45.150 --> 00:08:48.700
diseases.
One, the microorganism must always be present,

00:08:48.700 --> 00:08:50.540
in every case of the disease.

00:08:50.540 --> 00:08:55.130
Two, the germ must be able to be isolated
from a host containing the disease and grown

00:08:55.130 --> 00:08:59.060
in a lab, in a “culture.”
Three, samples taken from the culture must

00:08:59.060 --> 00:09:03.960
cause the same disease when introduced into
a healthy model animal like a mouse.

00:09:03.960 --> 00:09:08.590
Four, the germ must be isolated from that
new animal, meaning it is the same organism

00:09:08.590 --> 00:09:11.020
that caused the disease in the original host.

00:09:11.020 --> 00:09:16.630
So structure matters: in all infections, germs
grow out of hand, throwing the body out of

00:09:16.630 --> 00:09:22.520
whack and causing inflammation. These bad
germs, or pathogens, develop and live within

00:09:22.520 --> 00:09:25.900
us, and can kill us.
But with Pasteur’s vaccines and Koch’s

00:09:25.900 --> 00:09:31.250
scientific method of ID-ing bacteria, humans
could now develop medicines to fight jerk-sauce

00:09:31.250 --> 00:09:33.060
germs. Go team us!

00:09:33.060 --> 00:09:37.900
Back in the world of multicellular organisms,
another scientist at the intersection of biology

00:09:37.900 --> 00:09:41.750
and medicine was exploring the structure of
living things.

00:09:41.750 --> 00:09:46.240
In 1892, German-American physiologist Jacques
Loeb began his experiments

00:09:46.240 --> 00:09:52.280
on embryonic development, or how organisms
grow from single-celled embryos into whatever

00:09:52.280 --> 00:09:56.110
they’re supposed to look like.
So he started dunking sea urchin embryos into

00:09:56.110 --> 00:10:02.800
different salt solutions. And, in 1899, he
got one to give birth… just from being salty!

00:10:02.800 --> 00:10:08.990
Loeb’s artificial parthenogenesis, or birth
from the self, was mega-astounding news. It

00:10:08.990 --> 00:10:15.520
raised basic questions, such as what is sex?
Could a human one day give birth by herself…

00:10:15.520 --> 00:10:20.230
or him-self? Causing sea urchins to give virgin
births made Loeb a celebrity.

00:10:20.230 --> 00:10:25.820
But for the history of biology, it was revolutionary
that Loeb’s sense of scientific understanding

00:10:25.820 --> 00:10:31.610
of life was tied to his ability to control
it. His work with sea urchins can be seen

00:10:31.610 --> 00:10:38.070
as an early form of bioengineering, or treating
cells and tissues as machine-parts to be used

00:10:38.070 --> 00:10:42.980
constructively by a human designer.
Loeb’s notable students included the behavioral

00:10:42.980 --> 00:10:48.480
psychologists, B. F. Skinner and J. B. Watson,
and a creator of birth control, Gregory Pincus.

00:10:48.480 --> 00:10:54.460
Biology, like other scientific disciplines,
shows a historical arc from observations to

00:10:54.460 --> 00:10:59.740
experiments, and from less control to more.
From the mid-1800s to the early 1900s, scientists

00:10:59.740 --> 00:11:05.390
moved from mostly believing that living things
spontaneously appear out of nowhere to controlling

00:11:05.390 --> 00:11:09.420
fermentation on a massive scale. Cheers to
that!

00:11:09.420 --> 00:11:14.240
Next time—we’ll add the missing mechanism
to this crazy Rube Goldberg machine we call

00:11:14.240 --> 00:11:19.740
biology: it’s time for a monk named Mendel
to accidentally figure out genetic variation—in

00:11:19.740 --> 00:11:24.080
mice, men, and peas.
