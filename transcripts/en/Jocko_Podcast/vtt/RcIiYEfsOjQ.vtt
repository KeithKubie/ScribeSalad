1
00:00:00.280 --> 00:00:04.120
Is it ever okay to violate core values to achieve a goal?

2
00:00:06.270 --> 00:00:07.680
Okay.
So first of all,

3
00:00:08.400 --> 00:00:13.400
really obvious your values and your goals should be aligned.

4
00:00:14.220 --> 00:00:17.400
They should not be adversarial,
they shouldn't be counter to each other.

5
00:00:17.790 --> 00:00:20.640
And if you think about what your goals are,

6
00:00:20.641 --> 00:00:24.600
your goals should be set up in a way that they support your values and vice

7
00:00:24.601 --> 00:00:26.520
versa.
That's just the way it is.

8
00:00:26.521 --> 00:00:29.040
So I'm not sure where this is going to be an issue.

9
00:00:29.041 --> 00:00:32.070
If you're setting up goals that are contrary to your values,

10
00:00:32.071 --> 00:00:33.240
you've got some issues.
Now,

11
00:00:33.420 --> 00:00:38.420
I guess if you had the goal of winning the Blue Blue Belt Jujitsu championships,

12
00:00:41.330 --> 00:00:43.560
and in order to win you,
you cheated.

13
00:00:43.830 --> 00:00:46.740
Like you claimed someone was reaping your leg and use it.
Oh,

14
00:00:46.920 --> 00:00:49.350
you tap and you get the guide to qualified and you win.
That's,

15
00:00:49.400 --> 00:00:53.700
it could be an example right now,
do I support that?
No.
You know that's wrong.
You,

16
00:00:53.701 --> 00:00:57.990
you go win against the values of actually the values of martial arts to do that.

17
00:00:58.020 --> 00:01:00.540
So you didn't win anything and you didn't achieve your goal because you weren't

18
00:01:00.541 --> 00:01:05.280
actually the best.
Right?
So I say no on that one.
Uh,
another one,

19
00:01:06.180 --> 00:01:10.350
let's say you wanted to make a certain level of profit at your company,

20
00:01:11.820 --> 00:01:15.990
so you cheated a little bit on the quality of the manufacturing and you sold

21
00:01:15.991 --> 00:01:20.660
items that weren't quite reliable.
Do I support that?

22
00:01:20.690 --> 00:01:25.130
No.
Right.
For annual.
And why?
Let me tell you why.
Because your goal,

23
00:01:25.850 --> 00:01:28.730
your goal is not even aligned with your goal itself.

24
00:01:28.731 --> 00:01:33.560
Because when you start making substandard manufactured items,

25
00:01:33.620 --> 00:01:36.230
what's going to happen in the long run?
People are gonna say,
we don't like these.

26
00:01:36.280 --> 00:01:39.650
Yeah,
we're not going to buy him anymore.
So you didn't win.

27
00:01:40.040 --> 00:01:42.620
You might've wanted the short term,
but you didn't win in.
And again,

28
00:01:42.621 --> 00:01:43.910
you're going against your value of,

29
00:01:43.911 --> 00:01:46.040
you should have values that you don't want to.

30
00:01:47.240 --> 00:01:47.490
<v 1>Hmm.</v>

31
00:01:47.490 --> 00:01:51.300
<v 0>You know,
take profit over making good product.
And again,</v>

32
00:01:51.900 --> 00:01:55.170
in the long run,
that value is going to cost you.
Right.

33
00:01:55.200 --> 00:02:00.070
People aren't going to want to buy your product anymore.
Okay.

34
00:02:00.071 --> 00:02:01.030
Another one I could think of,

35
00:02:01.031 --> 00:02:04.990
like let's say your goal was to lose weight or to gain weight or whatever,

36
00:02:05.320 --> 00:02:10.000
some kind of positive physical change answer.
You're working hard,

37
00:02:10.001 --> 00:02:12.490
but then you decide you're going to jump on the steroids,
right?

38
00:02:12.491 --> 00:02:16.360
You're going to jump on steroids and you get that goal,
right?

39
00:02:16.361 --> 00:02:19.060
Because steroids are a huge advantage.
But again,

40
00:02:19.061 --> 00:02:22.210
I say no because if you think about what your goal is,

41
00:02:22.211 --> 00:02:25.750
like why are you trying to gain weight or lose weight?
Your goal is to be,

42
00:02:25.790 --> 00:02:29.770
is to be healthy,
right?
That's your value is you value your health.

43
00:02:30.340 --> 00:02:33.550
And so when the minute you start doing something that's countered your health,

44
00:02:34.360 --> 00:02:36.980
well that's not,
that's not helping your longterm.

45
00:02:37.350 --> 00:02:40.210
It's your value is not aligned with your goal and your goal is not aligned with

46
00:02:40.211 --> 00:02:41.860
your values.
So get them lined up.

47
00:02:42.190 --> 00:02:43.023
<v 1>Mm.</v>

48
00:02:44.910 --> 00:02:49.910
<v 0>So now might we at some point compromise our values,</v>

49
00:02:52.290 --> 00:02:54.330
compromise our values to reach a goal?

50
00:02:54.331 --> 00:02:58.020
I think that changes the answer a little bit,
right?
We might compromise.

51
00:02:58.580 --> 00:03:01.210
You remember that question that we had about the people that are snakes and how

52
00:03:01.211 --> 00:03:03.280
do you work with them?
You know,

53
00:03:03.281 --> 00:03:06.730
should you work with someone that's dishonest or backstabbing,

54
00:03:06.731 --> 00:03:11.731
but there are a cog in the machine of your team and your values,

55
00:03:12.850 --> 00:03:17.020
right?
They might beat a call a person out and say,
hey,
you're a,

56
00:03:17.080 --> 00:03:21.160
you're a backstabber and I don't want to work with you that that might be what

57
00:03:21.161 --> 00:03:25.580
your values tell you to do,
but your goal,
the end,
if you do that,

58
00:03:25.810 --> 00:03:27.400
first of all,
you don't progress.
You don't,

59
00:03:27.401 --> 00:03:30.010
your team doesn't work better together.
They work worse together.

60
00:03:30.340 --> 00:03:35.340
And so in the long run you don't win because you stuck hardcore with your

61
00:03:37.271 --> 00:03:41.500
values.
And by the way,
if you stick with your,
if you,

62
00:03:41.501 --> 00:03:42.670
if you bend your values,

63
00:03:42.671 --> 00:03:45.640
you compromise your values a little bit to get through this transitional period.

64
00:03:45.850 --> 00:03:48.490
Now you get promoted,
now you get a situation where you can fire that person.

65
00:03:48.491 --> 00:03:51.460
That's a backstabber.
So you,

66
00:03:52.020 --> 00:03:55.540
you have to compromise your values as a person a little bit.

67
00:03:58.250 --> 00:04:02.840
And you know there's the enemy of my enemy is my friend,
right?

68
00:04:02.930 --> 00:04:04.640
The enemy of my enemy is my friend.

69
00:04:04.641 --> 00:04:09.641
So you might compromise your values short term working somebody that you're not

70
00:04:09.651 --> 00:04:12.320
totally aligned with value wise.
And again,

71
00:04:12.500 --> 00:04:16.760
if you're going to get the long term strategic goal,

72
00:04:16.790 --> 00:04:20.030
well then maybe it's worth it because I'm going to put you in a position where

73
00:04:20.031 --> 00:04:24.260
you can then hold your values better.
He,
from a,

74
00:04:24.320 --> 00:04:27.260
from a senior position or from a more powerful position,

75
00:04:27.590 --> 00:04:30.380
so you might compromise them a little bit.
Again,

76
00:04:30.381 --> 00:04:33.410
these are small compromises and you should have things,
of course,

77
00:04:33.411 --> 00:04:37.610
we got things that values that you're,
you never gonna compromise on,

78
00:04:38.390 --> 00:04:41.960
right?
I'm hitting a girl.
Yeah.
Right.

79
00:04:42.890 --> 00:04:46.280
You should,
you should never hit a girl,
right.
Never hit a woman

80
00:04:47.930 --> 00:04:49.850
now.
But that being said,

81
00:04:51.200 --> 00:04:56.030
if there's a woman that's about to do something truly evil,
you know,

82
00:04:56.540 --> 00:04:59.210
kill a child or some kind of a terrorist act,

83
00:04:59.211 --> 00:05:03.830
and the only thing you have that you can stop it is to hit her.
Well,
guess what?

84
00:05:03.831 --> 00:05:06.230
She's getting hit.
You know what I mean?
So even then,

85
00:05:06.860 --> 00:05:11.510
your value of never hitting a girl can be compromised momentarily while you stop

86
00:05:12.020 --> 00:05:16.190
a child from being murdered or whatever.
Yeah.
Um,

87
00:05:17.820 --> 00:05:21.170
do you know,
we,
as we hold a value,
we always want to tell the truth.

88
00:05:21.630 --> 00:05:22.463
<v 2>Hmm.</v>

89
00:05:23.740 --> 00:05:26.140
<v 0>But if you had a,
for an extreme example,</v>

90
00:05:26.141 --> 00:05:28.930
if you had some kind of a state secret and,

91
00:05:29.650 --> 00:05:34.650
and you've got captured won't of course you might lie about that and there's

92
00:05:34.841 --> 00:05:35.261
little,

93
00:05:35.261 --> 00:05:40.261
I mean we could get into a whole like a white lie discussion on stuff like when

94
00:05:40.631 --> 00:05:44.860
your wife asks you how's the chicken and you want to tell her it's the most dry

95
00:05:45.290 --> 00:05:46.123
and

96
00:05:47.410 --> 00:05:51.190
charcoal tasting item that you've ever put in your mouth,

97
00:05:51.220 --> 00:05:54.070
that's not going to help you with long term.
No.
So I might,

98
00:05:54.520 --> 00:05:59.520
I might compromise my values of being truthful and tell her it's pretty good.

99
00:06:00.201 --> 00:06:02.420
Can I have some more ketchup over here?

100
00:06:02.900 --> 00:06:07.400
Can I get some more barbecue sauce on this ketchup on chicken and I'm going to

101
00:06:07.401 --> 00:06:09.010
go grab some more water.
Would you like to say?

102
00:06:09.350 --> 00:06:13.580
So I might compromise my values a little bit there.
Uh,

103
00:06:14.750 --> 00:06:19.520
so
I guess what I'm saying is,
and people,
this is the thing,

104
00:06:19.550 --> 00:06:24.550
people probably what they think of my persona because people will think,

105
00:06:26.120 --> 00:06:29.740
oh,
I'm just going to be this on compromising never Sentilo Lao,

106
00:06:29.750 --> 00:06:34.310
no slack kind of person.
Right?
That's what people want it want,

107
00:06:35.300 --> 00:06:37.850
you know,
want I guess want to see me as,

108
00:06:37.880 --> 00:06:42.740
but the reality is reason,
right?

109
00:06:42.741 --> 00:06:46.370
Reason and thought can,

110
00:06:46.400 --> 00:06:50.060
can override values for the right reasons.

111
00:06:51.080 --> 00:06:55.490
And that's why we can think that's why we can take,
and there's,

112
00:06:55.760 --> 00:06:56.750
there's actually times,

113
00:06:57.500 --> 00:07:02.500
there's actually times when holding your values goes against your values.

114
00:07:03.170 --> 00:07:06.590
So if yours back up your friends,
right?
You always backup your friends,

115
00:07:06.920 --> 00:07:10.610
but then your friend does something that's totally immoral and is against your

116
00:07:10.611 --> 00:07:12.440
values.
Well then you can't back up.

117
00:07:12.441 --> 00:07:14.810
You can't hold the value of backing up your friends because guess what?

118
00:07:14.811 --> 00:07:17.030
They did something immoral.
They did something that was wrong.

119
00:07:17.690 --> 00:07:21.080
And so if you held your values,
you'd be not holding your values.

120
00:07:21.470 --> 00:07:25.100
That's the dichotomy there,
right?
That's the dichotomy that,

121
00:07:25.101 --> 00:07:29.240
and the additional dichotomy is you hold your values,
right?

122
00:07:29.630 --> 00:07:32.330
You hold to those basic principles that you believe in.

123
00:07:32.990 --> 00:07:36.830
But at the same time you've got to apply logic and reason to them to make sure

124
00:07:36.831 --> 00:07:40.760
that they are supporting your longterm goal and your longterm values.

125
00:07:41.390 --> 00:07:42.320
Cause you don't wanna,

126
00:07:42.830 --> 00:07:47.830
you don't want to make a hard stand on something that costs you everything.

127
00:07:47.961 --> 00:07:51.470
We're now in the future.
You can no longer manipulate anymore situations.

128
00:07:54.920 --> 00:07:59.920
That's one of the things that makes leadership a handle and life hard is that it

129
00:08:00.231 --> 00:08:03.380
isn't black and white.
It isn't black and white.
It's gray.

130
00:08:04.490 --> 00:08:07.940
And so our decisions on these very things,

131
00:08:07.941 --> 00:08:12.500
these are the challenges of leadership
and there's,

132
00:08:13.130 --> 00:08:17.330
there's no way right or wrong answer of,
of saying if it's right or wrong,

133
00:08:17.331 --> 00:08:21.500
to violate your,
your values to achieve a goal that our initial questions,

134
00:08:21.501 --> 00:08:24.500
there's too many variables in that.
There's too many variables.

135
00:08:24.740 --> 00:08:27.740
But start with this part that I started the whole answer with.

136
00:08:27.770 --> 00:08:31.760
Align your values with your goal.
That's where you start.

137
00:08:32.030 --> 00:08:34.070
And then you use reason

138
00:08:35.870 --> 00:08:40.870
and logic and fought to determine your actions based on the situation weighed

139
00:08:41.811 --> 00:08:45.380
against your values.
You have to think,

140
00:08:46.580 --> 00:08:50.600
yeah.
So given what you're saying,
yes,

141
00:08:50.780 --> 00:08:55.160
it's still,
it's less like just values.

142
00:08:55.170 --> 00:08:56.370
Like you have a dinner

143
00:08:56.370 --> 00:09:01.350
<v 3>plate with here's my values kind of thing.
It's more of a hierarchy of values.</v>

144
00:09:01.470 --> 00:09:05.490
So you will violate your values.
If it's on,
you know,

145
00:09:05.520 --> 00:09:08.360
level two for a level four.
You know what I mean?

146
00:09:08.390 --> 00:09:10.740
Like I'll hit all knock a girl right out.

147
00:09:10.980 --> 00:09:15.720
If it's in the way of my higher value,
which is protect your family,

148
00:09:15.721 --> 00:09:19.080
protect my family,
kids,
you know,
all this stuff.
Same thing with

149
00:09:19.110 --> 00:09:22.150
<v 0>girls.
Don't mess ladies out there.
Don't mess with that.
Goes family.</v>

150
00:09:22.410 --> 00:09:23.550
Please don't come at you.

151
00:09:23.810 --> 00:09:26.850
<v 3>You know,
obviously same thing with the,
you know,
the um,</v>

152
00:09:27.810 --> 00:09:30.250
reading on your phone or backing up your friend.
You know,

153
00:09:30.280 --> 00:09:32.980
my values back into my friend.
That's level two.
You know,

154
00:09:32.981 --> 00:09:37.180
the whole air moral thing,
assaulting a girl,
I don't know,
whatever that,
you know,

155
00:09:37.810 --> 00:09:40.630
that's level four.
So sorry,
number two,
you know,

156
00:09:40.631 --> 00:09:42.270
I'm going for number four kind of.
So it's like a higher,

157
00:09:42.340 --> 00:09:44.860
<v 0>yeah,
you got a little hierarchy,
values and now there's some,
you know,</v>

158
00:09:44.861 --> 00:09:48.030
obviously there's some that I can't eat.
You know,

159
00:09:48.090 --> 00:09:52.750
you could give any of one of your highest values that you could come up with and

160
00:09:52.751 --> 00:09:53.670
you could sit here and,

161
00:09:53.710 --> 00:09:58.150
and theoretically come up with a situation where you would sacrifice that value.

162
00:09:58.470 --> 00:10:02.830
And that's fire is getting.
So that's why we're humans.

163
00:10:02.860 --> 00:10:04.180
We have the ability to think,

164
00:10:04.420 --> 00:10:08.170
we have the ability to reason and sometimes you might have to compromise your

165
00:10:08.171 --> 00:10:12.490
values a little bit to do,
we'll survive,
right?
Yeah.

166
00:10:12.550 --> 00:10:16.450
To survive and get so that you can longterm

167
00:10:18.010 --> 00:10:20.590
carry out your values to a higher degree.

168
00:10:20.660 --> 00:10:25.190
<v 3>Yeah.
Yeah.
Like the um,
and the d back to the,</v>

169
00:10:25.270 --> 00:10:27.320
uh,
people want to lose weight,
you know,

170
00:10:29.660 --> 00:10:33.950
if usually people who,
I don't know,

171
00:10:33.951 --> 00:10:37.160
I guess I would imagine that usually people who take steroids,

172
00:10:37.161 --> 00:10:39.950
their value isn't the health.
It's like,
because people don't typically,

173
00:10:39.951 --> 00:10:43.530
unless it's a medical thing,
you know,
um,
you know,
the staring thing for ally,

174
00:10:43.531 --> 00:10:48.430
it's for to win or to be cool.
Yeah.
Which is kind of strange,
but you know,

175
00:10:48.490 --> 00:10:52.790
it's usually to win a competition or something like this.
But,
um,
but nonetheless,

176
00:10:52.791 --> 00:10:54.290
I think that holds true given what you said.

177
00:10:54.410 --> 00:10:57.530
And I think it's kind of kind of coming together there.

178
00:10:57.590 --> 00:10:59.240
I think that it is like a hierarchy.

179
00:11:00.100 --> 00:11:04.360
<v 0>Yeah.
Yeah.
And if someone's going to use steroids to cheat,</v>

180
00:11:04.570 --> 00:11:08.770
that's,
I mean,
even that we could,
it's a whole nother discussion,

181
00:11:08.950 --> 00:11:11.590
but what do they really proving?
What are they really winning?

182
00:11:11.990 --> 00:11:13.980
<v 3>Right.
Yeah.
And that goes back to remember,
uh,</v>

183
00:11:14.180 --> 00:11:16.700
I forget what we were talking about.
Like some people,
like they want to,

184
00:11:17.210 --> 00:11:20.060
they want to,
they want to appear to win.
You know,

185
00:11:20.061 --> 00:11:23.060
especially now you can see it on like online that you don't spend that much time

186
00:11:23.061 --> 00:11:28.040
at Lake just cruising Facebook.
But you see,
you can see someone that,
you know,

187
00:11:28.610 --> 00:11:32.930
I don't know.
They're there.
They're about to murder each other.
Husband and wife,

188
00:11:32.931 --> 00:11:35.300
they hate each other.
They don't even sleep in the same room,

189
00:11:35.420 --> 00:11:38.420
but they went on vacation with their kids or whatever,
and they're like,
oh,

190
00:11:38.421 --> 00:11:41.510
so in love in front of the Ferris wheel or the waterfall or whatever.

191
00:11:41.720 --> 00:11:42.553
And you're like,
Bro,

192
00:11:42.710 --> 00:11:47.330
you just want people to think you when you just want to appear that you won.

193
00:11:47.360 --> 00:11:50.510
You know?
But it's not real.
That's why people cheat.
Yeah.

194
00:11:50.570 --> 00:11:53.500
That's why I liked the guy that you did to thing when they're like,
okay,

195
00:11:53.501 --> 00:11:57.430
I'm gonna.
I'm gonna say,
this guy read my leg on a tab.
Oh,
he's DQT can't do that.

196
00:11:57.431 --> 00:12:00.970
But you know,
you eat it kind of thing.
He,
his goal wasn't to win.

197
00:12:00.971 --> 00:12:05.830
It was just to get the metal.
So it's,
you know,
getting the metal is appear,

198
00:12:05.860 --> 00:12:09.670
but he's just,
he doesn't have the proper values actually be the winner.

199
00:12:09.730 --> 00:12:12.400
He needs to check his values.
He needs to check.

200
00:12:12.401 --> 00:12:14.530
His hierarchy of values is what are you do.
