00:00:06.080 --> 00:00:06.980
[APPLAUSE]

00:00:06.980 --> 00:00:08.360
– If you'd like to stand there.
And what's your name?

00:00:08.360 --> 00:00:09.560
– Olivia

00:00:09.560 --> 00:00:11.940
– Olivia, all right.
So Olivia is going to be the internet

00:00:11.940 --> 00:00:14.820
and again Andy and I
going to try to exchange keys,

00:00:14.820 --> 00:00:16.640
but this time in the electronic world.

00:00:16.640 --> 00:00:19.160
We're going to send
all our information through you

00:00:19.160 --> 00:00:22.640
and you're going to try as hard as you can
to steal our secret key.

00:00:23.380 --> 00:00:26.400
Alright so keys in the electronic world
are really numbers,

00:00:26.400 --> 00:00:28.540
but we're going to represent
numbers by colours.

00:00:28.540 --> 00:00:31.260
So each colour represents
a different number.

00:00:31.260 --> 00:00:33.900
And we're going to start with
the color blue.

00:00:33.900 --> 00:00:36.680
Now blue is not a secret colour,
everybody knows blue.

00:00:36.680 --> 00:00:38.940
So I've got some blue,
Andy's got some blue,

00:00:38.940 --> 00:00:40.560
and Olivia's got some blue.

00:00:41.660 --> 00:00:42.820
The next thing I'm going to do

00:00:42.820 --> 00:00:45.000
is I'm going to choose
a secret colour,

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:47.500
and my secret color
is going to be yellow.

00:00:47.920 --> 00:00:50.820
Now I can't just send yellow
across the internet to Andy,

00:00:50.820 --> 00:00:52.260
because it will be stolen on the way.

00:00:52.500 --> 00:00:54.640
So to keep it secret,
what I'm going to do

00:00:54.640 --> 00:00:56.880
is to mix it with the blue.

00:00:57.060 --> 00:00:59.520
If I mix yellow and blue,
I get green.

00:01:00.040 --> 00:01:02.560
And that's another example
of a one-way process.

00:01:02.560 --> 00:01:06.140
Just took a few seconds to mix
the yellow and the blue to make green,

00:01:06.680 --> 00:01:09.800
but if you had to take the green
and separate all the molecules out,

00:01:09.800 --> 00:01:11.340
to get the blue
and the yellow again

00:01:11.340 --> 00:01:13.520
it would take millions of years,
it would be very hard.

00:01:13.900 --> 00:01:17.120
Okay so I'm going to take this green
and I'm going to send it over the internet,

00:01:17.440 --> 00:01:19.460
but remember you're trying
to steal all our secrets.

00:01:19.460 --> 00:01:23.000
So what I want you to do
is to make a copy of this colour.

00:01:23.200 --> 00:01:24.520
Okay, so what I want you to do

00:01:24.520 --> 00:01:26.920
is to pour half of the liquid
into this container.

00:01:27.240 --> 00:01:29.200
If you just pour it
up to that line, that's good.

00:01:30.500 --> 00:01:32.180
And keep going a bit more...

00:01:33.640 --> 00:01:35.680
And I'd stop about there,
that's excellent.

00:01:35.680 --> 00:01:37.940
Okay and you can pass the rest
over to Andy.

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:40.680
Now Andy's going
to do something similar,

00:01:40.680 --> 00:01:42.660
he's going to dream up
a secret colour,

00:01:42.660 --> 00:01:44.840
in his case
the secret color is red.

00:01:44.980 --> 00:01:47.660
Again, he can't send the red to me
through the internet

00:01:47.660 --> 00:01:50.640
or it will be copied, so he's going to use
this one-way process

00:01:50.640 --> 00:01:52.380
he's going to mix it
with the blue.

00:01:52.960 --> 00:01:54.740
So he gets a sort of purpley colour.

00:01:55.320 --> 00:01:58.580
And now he's going to send that mixture
to me over the internet.

00:01:58.860 --> 00:02:01.439
And again, you're trying
to steal our information,

00:02:01.439 --> 00:02:03.040
yeah you've got the hang of it,
so you pour half of it

00:02:03.040 --> 00:02:06.600
into that container,
just up as far as the line.

00:02:07.620 --> 00:02:09.640
A little bit more... bit more...

00:02:09.640 --> 00:02:11.780
Excellent thank you very much,
and you give the rest to me.

00:02:12.260 --> 00:02:16.940
Okay so here I have a mixture
of red and blue.

00:02:16.940 --> 00:02:20.860
What I'm going to do is to 
add my secret colour which is yellow.

00:02:21.440 --> 00:02:24.600
So I have a mixture
of red, yellow and blue.

00:02:25.060 --> 00:02:27.920
Andy's got a mixture of yellow and blue

00:02:27.920 --> 00:02:30.420
and he's going to add his
secret colour which is red.

00:02:31.420 --> 00:02:34.740
Ao Andy now also has a mixture
of red yellow and blue.

00:02:34.740 --> 00:02:37.460
So we've managed to agree
on the same secret colour.

00:02:37.460 --> 00:02:40.080
And if we just put these together
in the middle...

00:02:40.860 --> 00:02:44.660
I hope you'll be able to see
that those are indeed the same colour.

00:02:45.040 --> 00:02:49.460
Alright, what about our internet thief,
what information do you have?

00:02:49.460 --> 00:02:51.360
Can you make this same colour?
Let's have a look.

00:02:51.640 --> 00:02:54.300
Well this colour
is a mixture of red and blue

00:02:54.300 --> 00:02:57.380
and that's definitely
a bit different.

00:02:57.380 --> 00:03:00.540
You've got some yellow in here,
mixed with some blue

00:03:00.540 --> 00:03:03.920
so you can't unmix the colours,
remember you can only mix things.

00:03:03.920 --> 00:03:08.660
So why don't you try adding this to that
 and see if you can copy our secret colour.

00:03:09.620 --> 00:03:13.920
And what we'll see is that –
that's it just pour it all in, that's good.

00:03:15.660 --> 00:03:18.280
Now this is a different
color it's a different color because

00:03:18.280 --> 00:03:22.120
this is a mixture of red plus blue,
plus yellow plus blue,

00:03:22.120 --> 00:03:24.180
so it's got twice as much
blue in it.

00:03:24.720 --> 00:03:26.240
And the only other color you
know about is blue,

00:03:26.240 --> 00:03:27.820
so if you pour that in as well...

00:03:28.180 --> 00:03:30.530
That's actually just going to
make things even worse,

00:03:30.530 --> 00:03:32.100
there's even too much blue now.

00:03:32.100 --> 00:03:33.320
You can stop there that's fine.

00:03:34.440 --> 00:03:35.980
So we've seen how Andy and I

00:03:35.980 --> 00:03:38.720
have been able to agree
on a secret colour,

00:03:38.960 --> 00:03:41.820
and in the electronic world
that means we've agreed on a secret number.

00:03:42.460 --> 00:03:45.680
So next time you see that little yellow padlock
on your web browser,

00:03:45.680 --> 00:03:49.060
you'll know that your computer
and the website computer

00:03:49.060 --> 00:03:53.470
have done a little exchange
of secret numbers just like this one.

00:03:53.470 --> 00:03:56.980
And that means it's now okay
to put your credit card information

00:03:56.980 --> 00:04:00.711
or whatever it is into that website, 
because it'll be scrambled

00:04:00.720 --> 00:04:02.360
and other people won't be able to read it.

00:04:02.360 --> 00:04:04.100
Okay thank you very much.

00:04:04.100 --> 00:04:06.100
[APPLAUSE]

00:04:06.100 --> 00:04:08.100
