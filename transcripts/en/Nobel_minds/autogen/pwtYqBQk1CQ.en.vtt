hi I'm JC from Maryland and I just want

00:00:03.980 --> 00:00:03.990
hi I'm JC from Maryland and I just want
 

00:00:03.990 --> 00:00:06.140
hi I'm JC from Maryland and I just want
to know now that we found water on the

00:00:06.140 --> 00:00:06.150
to know now that we found water on the
 

00:00:06.150 --> 00:00:08.179
to know now that we found water on the
moon how student you think we'll be able

00:00:08.179 --> 00:00:08.189
moon how student you think we'll be able
 

00:00:08.189 --> 00:00:12.169
moon how student you think we'll be able
to set up a moon base yjc yes we did

00:00:12.169 --> 00:00:12.179
to set up a moon base yjc yes we did
 

00:00:12.179 --> 00:00:14.690
to set up a moon base yjc yes we did
find water on the moon we don't know

00:00:14.690 --> 00:00:14.700
find water on the moon we don't know
 

00:00:14.700 --> 00:00:15.890
find water on the moon we don't know
whether there's enough of it to be

00:00:15.890 --> 00:00:15.900
whether there's enough of it to be
 

00:00:15.900 --> 00:00:18.080
whether there's enough of it to be
useful to us but it's definitely there

00:00:18.080 --> 00:00:18.090
useful to us but it's definitely there
 

00:00:18.090 --> 00:00:20.660
useful to us but it's definitely there
so how long would it take for us to set

00:00:20.660 --> 00:00:20.670
so how long would it take for us to set
 

00:00:20.670 --> 00:00:23.210
so how long would it take for us to set
up a moon base well it took us seven

00:00:23.210 --> 00:00:23.220
up a moon base well it took us seven
 

00:00:23.220 --> 00:00:26.240
up a moon base well it took us seven
years for the United States giving top

00:00:26.240 --> 00:00:26.250
years for the United States giving top
 

00:00:26.250 --> 00:00:28.009
years for the United States giving top
priority to getting the Apollo program

00:00:28.009 --> 00:00:28.019
priority to getting the Apollo program
 

00:00:28.019 --> 00:00:32.179
priority to getting the Apollo program
to to go and seven years from start to

00:00:32.179 --> 00:00:32.189
to to go and seven years from start to
 

00:00:32.189 --> 00:00:34.280
to to go and seven years from start to
first landing on the moon that was a

00:00:34.280 --> 00:00:34.290
first landing on the moon that was a
 

00:00:34.290 --> 00:00:35.959
first landing on the moon that was a
tremendous national effort that took

00:00:35.959 --> 00:00:35.969
tremendous national effort that took
 

00:00:35.969 --> 00:00:37.370
tremendous national effort that took
everything the United States had to

00:00:37.370 --> 00:00:37.380
everything the United States had to
 

00:00:37.380 --> 00:00:39.680
everything the United States had to
offer half a million people worked on

00:00:39.680 --> 00:00:39.690
offer half a million people worked on
 

00:00:39.690 --> 00:00:42.500
offer half a million people worked on
that project so in seven years with a

00:00:42.500 --> 00:00:42.510
that project so in seven years with a
 

00:00:42.510 --> 00:00:44.810
that project so in seven years with a
half a million people you could do it if

00:00:44.810 --> 00:00:44.820
half a million people you could do it if
 

00:00:44.820 --> 00:00:46.160
half a million people you could do it if
you don't want to put that much work

00:00:46.160 --> 00:00:46.170
you don't want to put that much work
 

00:00:46.170 --> 00:00:48.979
you don't want to put that much work
into it it'll take you longer so maybe

00:00:48.979 --> 00:00:48.989
into it it'll take you longer so maybe
 

00:00:48.989 --> 00:00:51.529
into it it'll take you longer so maybe
10 15 20 years depending on how much

00:00:51.529 --> 00:00:51.539
10 15 20 years depending on how much
 

00:00:51.539 --> 00:00:52.689
10 15 20 years depending on how much
resources would be made available

00:00:52.689 --> 00:00:52.699
resources would be made available
 

00:00:52.699 --> 00:00:56.570
resources would be made available
technically we could do it quickly
