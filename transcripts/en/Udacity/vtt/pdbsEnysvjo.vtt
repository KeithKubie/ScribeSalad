00:00:00.180 --> 00:00:03.459
So, I want you to think about how we should do modularize our search engine.

00:00:03.459 --> 00:00:07.784
Here's all the functions that we defined. Our goal is to figure out a way to

00:00:07.784 --> 00:00:11.240
group these functions into a small number of modules, that will have a narrow

00:00:11.240 --> 00:00:14.696
interface that will make sense and that will help us manage the complexity of

00:00:14.696 --> 00:00:18.868
the search engine. Let me give you a few choices. So, choice A will have two

00:00:18.868 --> 00:00:22.192
modules. The first one will contain will contain the functions get<u>next</u>target,

00:00:22.192 --> 00:00:25.864
get_all _targets, add<u>page</u>to _index, add<u>to</u>index, crawl_web, and

00:00:25.864 --> 00:00:29.436
compute_ranks. The second module will contain the lookup function, as well as

00:00:29.436 --> 00:00:33.544
lucky_search, quicksort_pages, and ordered_search. For choice B, we'll group the

00:00:33.544 --> 00:00:37.671
first six functions in one module. And we'll group the next four in another

00:00:37.671 --> 00:00:41.385
module. And for choice C, we're going to group get<u>next</u>target, get<u>all</u>links,

00:00:41.385 --> 00:00:46.293
add<u>page</u>to_index, add<u>to</u>index, and crawl_web in one module. We'll make lookup

00:00:46.293 --> 00:00:50.382
its own module. And we'll group the remaining functions in a third module. Which

00:00:50.382 --> 00:00:53.970
one of these three do you think would be best? Answering this is going to

00:00:53.970 --> 00:00:57.466
require some thought, and maybe a little speculation. And it might be possible

00:00:57.466 --> 00:01:00.720
that it would make a good case for more than one option. But I think there is

00:01:00.720 --> 00:01:03.963
one that's clearly best here and see if you can identify which one it is.
