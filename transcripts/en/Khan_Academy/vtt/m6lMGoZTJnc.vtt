00:00:00.660 --> 00:00:03.260
We've learned that
axial precession,

00:00:03.260 --> 00:00:06.180
it's not a change in the
tilt or the obliquity

00:00:06.180 --> 00:00:08.820
of our rotational axis, it's
a change in the direction.

00:00:08.820 --> 00:00:12.420
And over a long period
of time, 26,000 years,

00:00:12.420 --> 00:00:14.780
it kind of traces out a circle.

00:00:14.780 --> 00:00:16.900
And the main affect
of that is that if we

00:00:16.900 --> 00:00:20.230
wait long enough that our
rotational axis, or you could

00:00:20.230 --> 00:00:22.020
say almost the
North Pole, will be

00:00:22.020 --> 00:00:24.290
pointed in a
different direction.

00:00:24.290 --> 00:00:26.330
And so if our rotational
axis is pointed

00:00:26.330 --> 00:00:30.020
in a different direction
after a long enough time,

00:00:30.020 --> 00:00:32.299
then the absolute
point in our orbit,

00:00:32.299 --> 00:00:34.480
if we use the sun as
our frame of reference,

00:00:34.480 --> 00:00:37.400
the point in our orbit when
we are most pointed away

00:00:37.400 --> 00:00:39.880
from the sun, or when the
Northern Hemisphere is most

00:00:39.880 --> 00:00:44.310
pointed away from the sun,
will be earlier in the orbit.

00:00:44.310 --> 00:00:47.290
Now I emphasize that
that won't necessarily

00:00:47.290 --> 00:00:49.830
mean earlier in our calendar,
because our calendar,

00:00:49.830 --> 00:00:52.880
by definition, takes
into consideration,

00:00:52.880 --> 00:00:55.470
I guess, or it's
more based on when

00:00:55.470 --> 00:01:00.220
we are furthest tilted away
from the sun or furthest tilted

00:01:00.220 --> 00:01:01.410
towards the sun.

00:01:01.410 --> 00:01:06.490
So even though if we wait 1800
years, like the example I gave,

00:01:06.490 --> 00:01:09.980
we will be most tilted
away from the sun.

00:01:09.980 --> 00:01:14.280
The Northern Hemisphere
will have its winter equinox

00:01:14.280 --> 00:01:16.060
at an earlier
point in the orbit.

00:01:16.060 --> 00:01:20.630
According to our calendar, it
will still be December 22nd.

00:01:20.630 --> 00:01:22.830
If our calendar
instead was based--

00:01:22.830 --> 00:01:25.280
and it's not based on
this-- but if our calendar

00:01:25.280 --> 00:01:31.570
was based on the
exact point in orbit,

00:01:31.570 --> 00:01:37.140
then our year would be about
20, 25 minutes longer every year

00:01:37.140 --> 00:01:41.800
and then the date for
the start of winter

00:01:41.800 --> 00:01:43.729
actually would go back.

00:01:43.729 --> 00:01:45.770
1800 years later, the date
of the start of winter

00:01:45.770 --> 00:01:47.299
would be November 22nd.

00:01:47.299 --> 00:01:49.090
But that's not how we
measure our calendar.

00:01:49.090 --> 00:01:51.790
Our calendar is actually
measured from equinox

00:01:51.790 --> 00:01:52.940
to equinox.

00:01:52.940 --> 00:01:57.550
From December 22nd or 21st,
there's slight fluctuations

00:01:57.550 --> 00:02:00.200
depending on the calendar,
but that will always

00:02:00.200 --> 00:02:03.280
be the date that we are most
pointed away from the sun.

00:02:03.280 --> 00:02:09.539
That will not be necessarily
the date at this exact position

00:02:09.539 --> 00:02:11.300
relative to the sun itself.

00:02:11.300 --> 00:02:15.900
And that's why the actual
perihelion does change.

00:02:15.900 --> 00:02:18.220
Because if this is
always December 22nd,

00:02:18.220 --> 00:02:21.280
and if we, at first, assume
that the perihelion is always

00:02:21.280 --> 00:02:23.929
at the same fixed point in
space relative to the sun,

00:02:23.929 --> 00:02:25.470
although that's not
exactly the case,

00:02:25.470 --> 00:02:27.110
but if we make that
assumption, then it

00:02:27.110 --> 00:02:30.890
will be further and further
after that December 22nd,

00:02:30.890 --> 00:02:32.890
further and further
after that time,

00:02:32.890 --> 00:02:35.670
that we are most pointed
away from the sun.

00:02:35.670 --> 00:02:40.480
And that's why you have
this kind of pushing back

00:02:40.480 --> 00:02:41.720
of the perihelion.

00:02:41.720 --> 00:02:43.310
Now, what I want to
add to this video

00:02:43.310 --> 00:02:45.840
is that the perihelion
itself is also changing.

00:02:45.840 --> 00:02:50.900
So if I draw the sun
again, and right now

00:02:50.900 --> 00:02:54.460
our orbit looks
something like this,

00:02:54.460 --> 00:02:59.890
and I'm going to exaggerate
the eccentricity of it

00:02:59.890 --> 00:03:01.920
so that the perihelion
and the aphelion

00:03:01.920 --> 00:03:03.090
are a little bit clearer.

00:03:03.090 --> 00:03:04.620
So right now this
is the perihelion.

00:03:04.620 --> 00:03:06.161
This is the aphelion
based on the way

00:03:06.161 --> 00:03:08.670
I drew it right over
there in different colors.

00:03:08.670 --> 00:03:11.090
I don't want to show that's
necessarily where Earth is.

00:03:11.090 --> 00:03:13.690
Perihelion and
aphelion, there is also

00:03:13.690 --> 00:03:17.050
a rotation of this,
of the perihelion.

00:03:17.050 --> 00:03:21.650
And sometimes this is called the
precession of the perihelion,

00:03:21.650 --> 00:03:26.720
or perihelion precession,
or apsidal precession.

00:03:26.720 --> 00:03:28.380
These are all very hard to say.

00:03:28.380 --> 00:03:31.280
And so if we wait several
thousands of years

00:03:31.280 --> 00:03:35.520
our orbit might look a
little bit like this.

00:03:35.520 --> 00:03:39.210
The actual perihelion
will have rotated.

00:03:39.210 --> 00:03:41.050
So our orbit will
look like this.

00:03:41.050 --> 00:03:44.600
The actual ellipse would
have rotated a little bit.

00:03:44.600 --> 00:03:48.869
You wait a little bit longer,
it might look like this.

00:03:48.869 --> 00:03:50.410
And obviously, I'm
once again talking

00:03:50.410 --> 00:03:52.650
about over thousands
and thousands of years.

00:03:52.650 --> 00:03:55.210
From a year-to-year
basis, you really

00:03:55.210 --> 00:03:56.870
wouldn't notice the difference.

00:03:56.870 --> 00:03:58.900
But what that does
is, is we talked

00:03:58.900 --> 00:04:02.040
about the axial precession,
that this change in direction

00:04:02.040 --> 00:04:05.420
of our rotational axis,
it takes 26,000 years

00:04:05.420 --> 00:04:06.630
to complete one period.

00:04:10.850 --> 00:04:15.580
So 26,000 years from
today, our polar axis,

00:04:15.580 --> 00:04:19.180
if we don't think about
our rotational axis,

00:04:19.180 --> 00:04:22.630
if we aren't too concerned
about the actual change in tilt,

00:04:22.630 --> 00:04:25.220
which there will be some
small change in tilt,

00:04:25.220 --> 00:04:27.480
but 26,000 years
from now, our pole

00:04:27.480 --> 00:04:30.390
will roughly point in
the same direction again.

00:04:30.390 --> 00:04:32.780
We would have completed
one whole period

00:04:32.780 --> 00:04:34.780
of axial precession.

00:04:34.780 --> 00:04:39.090
However, it does not take
26,000 years for whatever

00:04:39.090 --> 00:04:40.930
our date of perihelion is today.

00:04:40.930 --> 00:04:42.049
So it's in January.

00:04:42.049 --> 00:04:43.590
I actually don't
know the exact date.

00:04:43.590 --> 00:04:44.590
You can look that up.

00:04:44.590 --> 00:04:46.275
But whatever that
data is in January,

00:04:46.275 --> 00:04:50.190
it will not take 26,000 years
for it to be that date again.

00:04:50.190 --> 00:04:55.909
And it would have taken 26,000
years if the perihelion itself

00:04:55.909 --> 00:04:58.200
were not changing, if it
always stayed fixed over here,

00:04:58.200 --> 00:05:02.690
if we did not have this
apsidal precession.

00:05:02.690 --> 00:05:04.740
But since it is
also changing, you

00:05:04.740 --> 00:05:06.750
could kind of say it
is over 1,000 years

00:05:06.750 --> 00:05:13.780
moving in that direction while
our January date is moving

00:05:13.780 --> 00:05:16.270
in that direction, they
will actually meet sooner,

00:05:16.270 --> 00:05:18.820
so that the precession will
be back on whatever date

00:05:18.820 --> 00:05:21.924
it is on January, less
than 26,000 years from now.

00:05:21.924 --> 00:05:24.590
And actually the exact time, and
I haven't done the calculation,

00:05:24.590 --> 00:05:26.260
but this is what
I've read, is that it

00:05:26.260 --> 00:05:30.910
will be 21,000 years from now.

00:05:30.910 --> 00:05:33.200
And then on top of that,
if that's enough for you

00:05:33.200 --> 00:05:36.620
that not only is the direction
of Earth's rotational axis

00:05:36.620 --> 00:05:38.480
changing and the
tilt is changing

00:05:38.480 --> 00:05:40.440
and that the perihelion
and the aphelion

00:05:40.440 --> 00:05:43.050
are also rotating around,
it's also the case

00:05:43.050 --> 00:05:46.510
that the eccentricity of the
orbit itself is changing.

00:05:46.510 --> 00:05:48.530
So over long periods
of time, Earth's orbit

00:05:48.530 --> 00:05:50.110
becomes more or less eccentric.

00:05:50.110 --> 00:05:53.140
And we've learned that
almost circular has--

00:05:53.140 --> 00:05:55.140
well if you're circular
you have no eccentricity

00:05:55.140 --> 00:05:57.140
and then you can become
more and more eccentric,

00:05:57.140 --> 00:05:59.240
which means you're
more and more of kind

00:05:59.240 --> 00:06:01.140
of this flattened out ellipse.

00:06:01.140 --> 00:06:04.700
And these cycles occur,
these eccentricities cycles

00:06:04.700 --> 00:06:09.410
occur over approximately
100,000 years.

00:06:09.410 --> 00:06:12.262
And so to revisit the
Milankovitch cycles-- and once

00:06:12.262 --> 00:06:13.220
again this is a theory.

00:06:13.220 --> 00:06:15.950
We're not sure whether this
is necessarily causing our ice

00:06:15.950 --> 00:06:17.700
ages or whether
this is necessarily

00:06:17.700 --> 00:06:20.930
a major influence over
long-term climate change,

00:06:20.930 --> 00:06:25.040
but the theory of
Milankovitch cycles

00:06:25.040 --> 00:06:26.560
is that over long
periods of time,

00:06:26.560 --> 00:06:29.230
if the eccentricity
changes enough

00:06:29.230 --> 00:06:32.540
and if it coincides with when
the perihelion and the seasons

00:06:32.540 --> 00:06:36.520
also coincide, maybe that's
enough to start an ice age.

00:06:36.520 --> 00:06:39.390
Or maybe that's enough to
take us out of an ice age.

00:06:39.390 --> 00:06:41.640
And actually, if you want
to throw something even more

00:06:41.640 --> 00:06:43.630
on that, the actual
plane of our orbit

00:06:43.630 --> 00:06:46.910
also changes over time mainly
because of interactions

00:06:46.910 --> 00:06:48.152
with the outer planets.

00:06:48.152 --> 00:06:49.360
Anyway, I'll leave you there.

00:06:49.360 --> 00:06:51.841
As you could imagine, this
is a very complex topic,

00:06:51.841 --> 00:06:53.590
but hopefully you now
have an appreciation

00:06:53.590 --> 00:06:56.509
of all the different ways our
orbit can change and maybe

00:06:56.509 --> 00:06:58.800
start to think about how that
might affect our weather.

00:06:58.800 --> 00:07:00.880
Although, we don't
necessarily know how it does

00:07:00.880 --> 00:07:03.600
or whether it even
really does affect

00:07:03.600 --> 00:07:06.670
going into or out of ice ages.
