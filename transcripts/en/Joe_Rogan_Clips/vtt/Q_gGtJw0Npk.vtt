WEBVTT

1
00:00:00.080 --> 00:00:04.510
Yeah.
And I'm in,
I'm not going to be,
because I tried,
uh,
Maria,

2
00:00:05.250 --> 00:00:07.260
Juana,
we'd weed.
Yeah.

3
00:00:07.530 --> 00:00:12.530
Once two years ago and I stayed hide for a 14 days straight to God man.

4
00:00:15.240 --> 00:00:19.120
Did you eat it 14 days?
No,
no smoke.
He wasn't a vaporizer.
Is that yeah.

5
00:00:19.330 --> 00:00:23.450
Vaporize vaporizer.
Yeah.
And I say hi for 14 days.
He says,

6
00:00:23.590 --> 00:00:27.660
and I thought he doesn't write,
he doesn't,
I wasn't high.
Right?

7
00:00:27.990 --> 00:00:29.920
Well probably it wasn't actually the second day,

8
00:00:30.780 --> 00:00:34.770
but I thought it was like disconnected from reality will sometimes that does

9
00:00:34.771 --> 00:00:39.210
happen.
And I know a story about a guy who is a straight laced guy who took some

10
00:00:39.300 --> 00:00:44.220
marijuana edibles so that he could get to sleep and he had a real problem.

11
00:00:44.430 --> 00:00:49.430
Like he got suicidal and freaked out and became just irrationally anxious.

12
00:00:50.880 --> 00:00:55.200
He had crippling anxiety in some time for some time for weeks.

13
00:00:55.620 --> 00:00:59.100
And he's a confident guy and a very handsome,

14
00:00:59.130 --> 00:01:01.470
big muscular guy.
Like he just like,

15
00:01:01.471 --> 00:01:03.630
you would never imagine this guy have any antianxiety.

16
00:01:03.900 --> 00:01:08.490
I think some people have just the chemistry of different individuals.

17
00:01:08.520 --> 00:01:11.700
I wasn't bar for death and that's what the doctor told me because I went to the

18
00:01:11.701 --> 00:01:16.440
psychiatrist.
Wow.
Psychiatry,
I swear to God,

19
00:01:16.830 --> 00:01:17.790
I'm that week,

20
00:01:18.120 --> 00:01:22.260
that week I went to the psychiatry smell and I told him no,

21
00:01:22.261 --> 00:01:25.620
I smoked that thing like 14 days ago and I still high.

22
00:01:26.340 --> 00:01:29.010
And he looked at me and he gave me some,

23
00:01:29.610 --> 00:01:34.470
some cycle one kicked me some bills and I was like,

24
00:01:34.500 --> 00:01:37.410
oh he few stay high until tomorrow.
Take this pills.

25
00:01:37.740 --> 00:01:42.740
Because what he told me something that I didn't know that it can be a trigger if

26
00:01:42.890 --> 00:01:47.890
you're has some tendencies of his schizophrenia and a psychopath or he should

27
00:01:48.981 --> 00:01:53.040
have,
which was not my case.
And he stole,
this is very rare,
but he can't happen,

28
00:01:53.250 --> 00:01:54.770
which is not your case.
And I,

29
00:01:54.771 --> 00:01:59.490
it was happy because of the setup and the next day I was okay and I felt okay

30
00:02:00.410 --> 00:02:04.350
and I did and took the pills and it was crazy,
man.
Fuck crazy.

31
00:02:04.351 --> 00:02:08.730
And I remember that I,
I decided to record about it cause I was like,
okay,
let me,

32
00:02:08.940 --> 00:02:11.250
let me record what I'm thinking.

33
00:02:11.251 --> 00:02:13.290
At least let's get some good experience out of it.

34
00:02:13.470 --> 00:02:15.990
And I remember that it started to record and I said,

35
00:02:16.350 --> 00:02:18.660
now I'm going to record everything that I'm thinking.

36
00:02:18.661 --> 00:02:23.070
And when I look at the cell phone,
it was 45 minutes,
45 minutes of talking,

37
00:02:23.490 --> 00:02:26.820
and I didn't make her realize,
I just said that I'm going to record now.

38
00:02:26.821 --> 00:02:31.440
And there was 45 minutes and when I listened like 15 days after that,
I was like,

39
00:02:31.650 --> 00:02:35.910
I'm so crazy.
I'm so crazy,
so crazy.
I'm gonna die.

40
00:02:36.120 --> 00:02:39.000
I'm never going to understand that.
My son's talking,
oh,

41
00:02:39.050 --> 00:02:43.880
is my son talking to me right now?
Wow.
That was one hit of a vapor one.

42
00:02:44.010 --> 00:02:48.420
No,
he was more than one.
A bunch of hits.
He was a bunch.
Oh,
you're too tall.

43
00:02:48.421 --> 00:02:53.400
You're big.
You're like a 250 pounds.
So fucking use it a lot.

44
00:02:53.520 --> 00:02:55.590
Also,
they were saying,
keep hitting it because you're tall.

45
00:02:55.620 --> 00:02:59.080
Because I wasn't feeling it.
Oh No.
But when I felt it,

46
00:02:59.350 --> 00:03:02.190
I felt for 14 people,

47
00:03:02.240 --> 00:03:04.990
that's one of the big problems with people in the first tries.

48
00:03:04.991 --> 00:03:07.600
They tried too much.
That's what happened.
Yeah.

49
00:03:07.601 --> 00:03:09.940
Someone just says take another hit.
It is a happy man.

50
00:03:09.970 --> 00:03:12.640
I tell people viewed thinking about try marijuana going into a little bit.

51
00:03:13.150 --> 00:03:16.830
That's it.
I don't feel anything.
Shut the fuck up.
Leave it alone.
It'll,

52
00:03:16.870 --> 00:03:19.980
you'll eventually feel something fun for.
Yeah.
It's leave it alone,
man.

53
00:03:20.030 --> 00:03:23.980
That's crazy,
man.
That's so many people selling weeds and stuff in there.

54
00:03:23.981 --> 00:03:27.040
This is not even cool anymore.
Weed's not cool.

55
00:03:28.860 --> 00:03:31.450
Yeah.
It's like people are suffering.
When I do shows,

56
00:03:31.451 --> 00:03:34.960
there's a lot of people talk,
oh,
I smoke this and I spoke.
That is like me,
man.

57
00:03:34.990 --> 00:03:38.080
It's legal now.
Yeah.
It's just like juice.

58
00:03:38.110 --> 00:03:41.470
It's not dangerous I think is good and he has to be.
There you go.
Yeah.
Whoa.

59
00:03:41.510 --> 00:03:44.860
Definitely should be.
It doesn't affect me that way for me.

60
00:03:44.870 --> 00:03:47.080
I've been smoking in a long time.
It's pretty easy.

61
00:03:47.230 --> 00:03:50.710
I just chills me out and makes me,
it actually makes me nicer.

62
00:03:51.320 --> 00:03:53.360
It makes me like a more calm person.

63
00:03:53.910 --> 00:03:55.990
Makes them a more sensitive to other people's feelings.

64
00:03:56.170 --> 00:03:59.990
Did you ever smoke because you fell that short intervals or like stressed out

65
00:04:00.160 --> 00:04:01.130
and no,

66
00:04:02.230 --> 00:04:06.340
I'm not going to perform well in this meeting or something and then was smoking?

67
00:04:06.370 --> 00:04:08.260
No,
it doesn't work like that for me.

68
00:04:08.500 --> 00:04:12.170
Like if I'm stressed out and I work out when you're stressed out,
that's,

69
00:04:12.171 --> 00:04:16.450
that's my best for alleviating that.
Marijuana is good for me for thinking,

70
00:04:16.900 --> 00:04:20.410
for contemplating and going over things and it's not,

71
00:04:20.440 --> 00:04:25.300
it's not good for me for stress.
Like for what?
If I feel like tense tension,

72
00:04:25.570 --> 00:04:28.090
I work out that that's what gets it out of me.
