00:00:00.620 --> 00:00:02.268
- [Voiceover] Currently
a local newspaper company

00:00:02.268 --> 00:00:05.542
sells print subscriptions
for $9.30 a month

00:00:05.542 --> 00:00:08.050
and has 2400 subscribers.

00:00:08.050 --> 00:00:10.685
Based on a survey conducted, they expect

00:00:10.685 --> 00:00:15.011
to lose 20 subscribers
for each 10 cent increase

00:00:15.011 --> 00:00:18.157
from the current monthly
subscription price.

00:00:18.157 --> 00:00:19.538
Alright, that's interest.

00:00:19.538 --> 00:00:21.813
What should the newspaper company charge

00:00:21.813 --> 00:00:24.692
for a monthly subscription
in order to maximize

00:00:24.692 --> 00:00:28.454
the income, in order
to maximize the income,

00:00:28.454 --> 00:00:31.745
from the print newspaper subscriptions?

00:00:31.878 --> 00:00:33.167
So let's think a little
bit about their income.

00:00:33.167 --> 00:00:34.107
It's actually their revenue,

00:00:34.107 --> 00:00:35.489
how much money they're bringing in,

00:00:35.489 --> 00:00:37.288
but I get what they're talking about.

00:00:37.288 --> 00:00:39.837
So their income, let's
just say I for income.

00:00:40.156 --> 00:00:42.547
It's going to be equal to
the number of subscribers

00:00:42.547 --> 00:00:44.393
they have, so S for subscribers,

00:00:44.393 --> 00:00:47.771
times the price per subscriber,

00:00:47.771 --> 00:00:50.180
times the price per subscriber.

00:00:50.406 --> 00:00:52.967
So that's going to be their income.

00:00:53.076 --> 00:00:56.710
Now in the problem, they tell us that

00:00:56.710 --> 00:00:58.335
the subscribers themselves are going

00:00:58.335 --> 00:00:59.926
to be a function of price,
and that makes sense.

00:00:59.926 --> 00:01:01.330
If your price goes up, you're going to

00:01:01.330 --> 00:01:03.327
have fewer subscribers.

00:01:03.327 --> 00:01:04.453
So they tell us right over here,

00:01:04.453 --> 00:01:06.729
based on a survey
conducted, they expect to

00:01:06.729 --> 00:01:11.628
lose 20 subscribers for
each 10 cent increase

00:01:11.628 --> 00:01:14.193
from the current monthly
subscription price,

00:01:14.193 --> 00:01:16.881
and the current monthly
subscription price is $9.30.

00:01:17.084 --> 00:01:19.266
So let's see if we can write our number

00:01:19.266 --> 00:01:22.198
of subscribers as a function of price.

00:01:22.854 --> 00:01:27.854
So at the current price,
we have 2400 subscribers,

00:01:27.895 --> 00:01:31.206
but we're going to lose 20 subscribers,

00:01:31.206 --> 00:01:33.423
so lose, so I'm going to
subtract 20 subscribers

00:01:33.423 --> 00:01:38.423
for every dime above $9.30.

00:01:40.203 --> 00:01:41.480
So let's multiply that.

00:01:41.480 --> 00:01:46.480
So if we just take our,
if we take P minus $9.30,

00:01:46.901 --> 00:01:49.780
this would give us the
absolute price increase,

00:01:49.780 --> 00:01:52.044
how much we've gone above $9.30,

00:01:52.044 --> 00:01:53.623
and if we wanted to
figure out how many dimes

00:01:53.623 --> 00:01:58.623
we are above $9.30, we could
just divide that by 10 cents.

00:02:00.321 --> 00:02:02.445
So this part right over
here, this tells us

00:02:02.445 --> 00:02:06.933
how many dimes above
our current price is P,

00:02:07.159 --> 00:02:08.656
and then for every one of those dimes,

00:02:08.656 --> 00:02:11.588
we're going to lose 20 subscribers.

00:02:11.860 --> 00:02:14.020
So this is probably the most interesting

00:02:14.020 --> 00:02:15.076
part of this problem.

00:02:15.076 --> 00:02:16.318
This is kind of the crux of it.

00:02:16.318 --> 00:02:20.051
How do you set up subscribers
as a function of price?

00:02:20.219 --> 00:02:21.960
Cause once you do this,
you can then substitute

00:02:21.960 --> 00:02:24.421
that in here and then you're going to have

00:02:24.421 --> 00:02:26.784
income purely as a function of price.

00:02:26.801 --> 00:02:28.275
Let me show you what I'm talking about.

00:02:28.275 --> 00:02:30.319
So before I actually even do that,

00:02:30.319 --> 00:02:32.206
let me simplify this a little bit.

00:02:32.223 --> 00:02:34.858
So subscribers is going to be equal to

00:02:34.858 --> 00:02:39.858
2400 and then let's see, 20
divided by 0.1 is gonna be

00:02:40.894 --> 00:02:45.894
200 minus 200 times P minus $9.30,

00:02:47.082 --> 00:02:49.996
and then we can distribute this 200,

00:02:49.996 --> 00:02:52.492
so subscribers is going to be equal to

00:02:52.492 --> 00:02:57.492
2400 minus 200P, and then
negative 200 times negative $9.30,

00:03:02.313 --> 00:03:06.580
let's see that's going to be
two times $9.30 is $18.60,

00:03:06.933 --> 00:03:10.939
so it's going to be $1800
and instead of $18.60,

00:03:10.939 --> 00:03:13.801
it's going to be $1860.

00:03:13.992 --> 00:03:18.992
So plus 1860, that's negative
200 times negative 9.3.

00:03:20.853 --> 00:03:22.484
And now we can add.

00:03:22.594 --> 00:03:26.779
We can add this to that
and we are going to get

00:03:27.679 --> 00:03:31.529
the subscribers are going to
be equal to 2400 plus 1860.

00:03:31.529 --> 00:03:33.595
If you add a thousand, you get to 3400,

00:03:33.595 --> 00:03:37.746
and then you add 860, you get 240, 260,

00:03:38.146 --> 00:03:43.146
so you get 4,260 minus 200P.

00:03:44.496 --> 00:03:46.992
So we now have a simplified subscribers

00:03:46.992 --> 00:03:48.989
as a function of price,

00:03:48.989 --> 00:03:52.506
and now we can substitute
this expression in for S

00:03:52.506 --> 00:03:55.937
in our original equation.

00:03:56.047 --> 00:03:58.531
So if we do that, we
get income is equal to

00:03:58.531 --> 00:04:03.531
instead of writing S, we
could write 4260 minus 200P

00:04:07.575 --> 00:04:08.939
and then times P.

00:04:11.069 --> 00:04:15.499
Now we can distribute this
P, and we're gonna get income

00:04:15.499 --> 00:04:20.499
as a function of price is
4260P minus 200P squared.

00:04:24.518 --> 00:04:27.251
So income as a function
of price is a quadratic,

00:04:27.251 --> 00:04:29.490
and I actually like to write
my highest degree terms first,

00:04:29.490 --> 00:04:32.532
so I'll just, income is equal
to, I'm just gonna swap these.

00:04:32.532 --> 00:04:37.532
Negative 200P squared, plus 4260P,

00:04:40.333 --> 00:04:41.517
so this is a quadratic.

00:04:41.517 --> 00:04:43.258
And it is a downward opening quadratic.

00:04:43.258 --> 00:04:44.593
We know that because the coefficient

00:04:44.593 --> 00:04:47.275
on the second degree term is negative.

00:04:47.275 --> 00:04:50.491
So this graph, I as a function of P,

00:04:50.491 --> 00:04:55.491
so if this is the I
axis, that's the I axis,

00:04:59.070 --> 00:05:01.798
and this is the P axis right over here.

00:05:01.798 --> 00:05:03.574
We know that it's going to be,

00:05:03.574 --> 00:05:05.315
so this is going to be the P axis,

00:05:05.315 --> 00:05:07.614
we know it's going to be a
downward opening parabola,

00:05:07.614 --> 00:05:09.657
and that's good because we
want to find the maximum point.

00:05:09.657 --> 00:05:11.271
A downward opening parabola will

00:05:11.271 --> 00:05:12.652
actually have a maximum point.

00:05:12.652 --> 00:05:13.622
If it was upward opening, you'd be

00:05:13.622 --> 00:05:14.661
able to find a minimum point,

00:05:14.661 --> 00:05:16.353
but then there's no, it wouldn't be

00:05:16.353 --> 00:05:18.152
bounded onto the up side.

00:05:18.152 --> 00:05:21.252
So we need to figure out what price

00:05:21.252 --> 00:05:23.417
gets us to this maximum point.

00:05:23.667 --> 00:05:25.988
And this price, this is
going to be the vertex,

00:05:25.988 --> 00:05:29.343
this is going to be the P coordinate

00:05:29.343 --> 00:05:31.300
of the vertex of this parabola.

00:05:32.083 --> 00:05:33.766
And let's just remind ourselves how

00:05:33.766 --> 00:05:35.508
we can find the vertex of a parabola.

00:05:35.508 --> 00:05:36.611
And there's multiple ways to do it.

00:05:36.611 --> 00:05:39.136
You can find the roots.

00:05:39.304 --> 00:05:40.825
You could find the X values that

00:05:40.825 --> 00:05:43.780
make this function equal zero,

00:05:43.785 --> 00:05:44.749
and then the vertex is going to be

00:05:44.749 --> 00:05:47.332
halfway between those points.

00:05:47.581 --> 00:05:48.661
That's one way to do it.

00:05:48.661 --> 00:05:50.182
Another way to do it is you could say,

00:05:50.182 --> 00:05:53.827
look if I have something of the form

00:05:53.827 --> 00:05:58.827
I is equal to A P squared plus B P plus C.

00:06:02.847 --> 00:06:05.529
Instead of writing Y
and X, I wrote I and P,

00:06:05.529 --> 00:06:08.245
well the vertex is going
to be the coefficient,

00:06:08.245 --> 00:06:11.519
the negative of this
coefficient, negative B,

00:06:11.519 --> 00:06:13.922
over two times A.

00:06:13.922 --> 00:06:16.691
That's going to be the P
coordinate of the vertex.

00:06:16.708 --> 00:06:19.018
P equals that is going to be when you hit

00:06:19.018 --> 00:06:20.504
the minimum or maximum point.

00:06:20.504 --> 00:06:22.832
In this case, it's going
to be the maximum point.

00:06:23.267 --> 00:06:26.262
So what's negative B?

00:06:26.262 --> 00:06:31.262
B is this right over here,
so negative B is 4260,

00:06:31.707 --> 00:06:33.483
and it's going to be over two A,

00:06:33.483 --> 00:06:36.397
over two times negative 200.

00:06:36.397 --> 00:06:38.969
So that's going be negative 400.

00:06:39.021 --> 00:06:40.124
And so what is that going to be?

00:06:40.124 --> 00:06:42.370
A negative divided by
negative is a positive.

00:06:42.538 --> 00:06:47.538
This is going to be the same
thing as 426 divided by 40,

00:06:49.643 --> 00:06:51.907
and let's see, can I simplify this?

00:06:51.907 --> 00:06:52.545
Well let me just see.

00:06:52.545 --> 00:06:57.316
This is going to be 40
goes into 426 ten times

00:06:57.316 --> 00:06:59.215
with 26 left over.

00:06:59.336 --> 00:07:03.643
So it's going to be 10 26/40,
or we could write this as,

00:07:03.643 --> 00:07:08.643
this is going to be equal to 10 13/20,

00:07:12.037 --> 00:07:14.660
and so if we wanted to write
that in terms of dollars,

00:07:14.660 --> 00:07:15.902
cause we're talking about a price,

00:07:15.902 --> 00:07:18.201
we would want to write this
in terms of hundredths,

00:07:18.201 --> 00:07:20.140
so this is, this would be
the same thing as 10 and,

00:07:20.140 --> 00:07:22.357
let's see if you multiply
the denominator by five,

00:07:22.357 --> 00:07:23.599
you multiply the numerator by five,

00:07:23.599 --> 00:07:28.599
10 65/100, which is the
same thing as $10.65.

00:07:29.764 --> 00:07:33.995
And luckily, we see that
choice right over there.

00:07:34.140 --> 00:07:35.475
Another way we could have done it is

00:07:35.475 --> 00:07:37.797
we could figure out well
what are the P values

00:07:37.797 --> 00:07:40.293
that get us to zero income,
and then the one that's

00:07:40.293 --> 00:07:41.999
halfway in between
those two is going to be

00:07:41.999 --> 00:07:43.555
where we hit our maximum.

00:07:43.555 --> 00:07:45.912
Halfway between your two roots

00:07:45.912 --> 00:07:47.908
are when you hit the maximum point,

00:07:47.908 --> 00:07:50.880
so that's another way that you
could actually tackle that.

00:07:50.880 --> 00:07:53.341
And you could do that just by
looking at this original one.

00:07:53.341 --> 00:07:55.338
You could say well when
does this thing equal zero?

00:07:55.338 --> 00:08:00.338
So you could say when does
4260P minus 200P squared

00:08:02.199 --> 00:08:05.009
equal zero and since you
have no constant term,

00:08:05.009 --> 00:08:06.436
you could just factor out a P,

00:08:06.436 --> 00:08:11.436
so you say P times 4260
minus P is equal to zero,

00:08:12.392 --> 00:08:14.214
so this is going to be
equal to zero either

00:08:14.214 --> 00:08:16.176
when P equals zero, and that makes sense,

00:08:16.176 --> 00:08:20.437
you're gonna have zero income
if you don't charge anything,

00:08:20.437 --> 00:08:25.437
or if 4260 minus P is equal
to, oh let me be careful here,

00:08:27.193 --> 00:08:32.193
I don't wanna, 4260 minus
200P is equal to zero,

00:08:34.855 --> 00:08:36.074
so that's going to be equal to zero

00:08:36.074 --> 00:08:41.074
either when P is equal to zero or when

00:08:41.078 --> 00:08:46.078
4260 minus 200P is equal to zero.

00:08:48.368 --> 00:08:49.726
This is when you don't charge anything,

00:08:49.726 --> 00:08:50.969
you're obviously gonna have no income,

00:08:50.969 --> 00:08:52.489
and this is when you charge so much

00:08:52.489 --> 00:08:54.672
you're gonna lose all your subscribers,

00:08:54.672 --> 00:08:56.576
and you'll have no income, but let's see.

00:08:56.576 --> 00:08:59.710
If you wanna solve for, if
you add 200P to both sides,

00:08:59.710 --> 00:09:04.710
you get 200P is equal to 4260.

00:09:04.714 --> 00:09:07.244
Divide both sides by
200, you get P is equal

00:09:07.244 --> 00:09:11.140
to 4260 over 200.

00:09:11.505 --> 00:09:12.585
That's this price over here.

00:09:12.585 --> 00:09:15.011
That's the price at which you
lose all your subscribers.

00:09:15.011 --> 00:09:17.147
So your maximum point is gonna be

00:09:17.147 --> 00:09:19.829
halfway in between these two,
halfway between zero and this,

00:09:19.829 --> 00:09:22.510
halfway between zero and that.

00:09:22.510 --> 00:09:24.507
Well halfway between zero and that,

00:09:24.507 --> 00:09:26.248
is just gonna be half of this,

00:09:26.248 --> 00:09:28.651
so your maximum point is going to be at

00:09:28.651 --> 00:09:33.651
4260 over 400, which is exactly
