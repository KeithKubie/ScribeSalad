00:00:00.070 --> 00:00:01.700
And three of these are rates.

00:00:01.700 --> 00:00:05.340
In each of these I can identify
the two different quantities.

00:00:05.340 --> 00:00:09.130
For example, dollars and
hours, babies and

00:00:09.130 --> 00:00:13.430
years, and ounces of Coke and calories.

00:00:13.430 --> 00:00:17.785
Which means I could write write these
rates as $12 divided by one hour,

00:00:17.785 --> 00:00:19.735
four million babies divided by one year,

00:00:19.735 --> 00:00:23.625
or two hundred sixty calories
divided by twenty ounces of coke.

00:00:23.625 --> 00:00:27.095
And notice that the word and
here actually corresponded to per,

00:00:27.095 --> 00:00:28.395
it actually meant division.

00:00:28.395 --> 00:00:31.710
And also notice that over here,
even though ounces of Coke,

00:00:31.710 --> 00:00:36.010
came first in the sentence, I decide to
put it in the denominator of my rate.

00:00:36.010 --> 00:00:38.990
And will see that with rate we
have the freedom to decide which

00:00:38.990 --> 00:00:41.320
quantity goes in the numerator and
which goes in denominator.

00:00:41.320 --> 00:00:43.140
But we'll explore that
a little bit more later.
