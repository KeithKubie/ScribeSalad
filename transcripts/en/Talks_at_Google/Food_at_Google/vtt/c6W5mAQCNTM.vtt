00:00:00.290 --> 00:00:01.780
JEFF BUCHAN: Good afternoon,
and welcome, everyone.

00:00:01.780 --> 00:00:02.860
Thanks for coming.

00:00:02.860 --> 00:00:04.690
Hello to everyone
watching on YouTube.

00:00:04.690 --> 00:00:07.189
My name is Jeff Buchan, and I
work on the Industry Relations

00:00:07.189 --> 00:00:08.310
team here at Google.

00:00:08.310 --> 00:00:09.810
Extremely excited
today to be joined

00:00:09.810 --> 00:00:13.000
by Pat Helding, owner and
creator of one of New York

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:15.370
City's most beloved
bakeries, Fat Witch Bakery,

00:00:15.370 --> 00:00:17.160
which is right here
in Chelsea Market.

00:00:17.160 --> 00:00:18.140
[APPLAUSE]

00:00:18.140 --> 00:00:19.306
PATRICIA HELDING: Thank you.

00:00:19.306 --> 00:00:21.080
Wow.

00:00:21.080 --> 00:00:23.270
JEFF BUCHAN: Pat launched
Fat Witch in 1998,

00:00:23.270 --> 00:00:27.732
and has since appeared on the
Food Network, CBS, CNN, MTV,

00:00:27.732 --> 00:00:29.690
and her mouth-watering
brownies have been named

00:00:29.690 --> 00:00:32.397
one of Oprah's favorite things.

00:00:32.397 --> 00:00:34.480
On the heels of the success
of her first cookbook,

00:00:34.480 --> 00:00:37.110
"Fat Witch Brownies,"
"Fat Witch Bake Sale,"

00:00:37.110 --> 00:00:40.380
which you see up
there, includes 67

00:00:40.380 --> 00:00:44.740
never-before-published recipes
for cakes, cookies, bars,

00:00:44.740 --> 00:00:47.490
brownies, and more from
Pat's personal collection.

00:00:47.490 --> 00:00:49.830
Pat and I actually
used to work together

00:00:49.830 --> 00:00:51.480
in the days of Google
Offers, and I'm

00:00:51.480 --> 00:00:53.040
thrilled to be speaking
with her again today.

00:00:53.040 --> 00:00:54.831
So please join me in
welcoming Pat Helding.

00:00:54.831 --> 00:00:55.680
[APPLAUSE]

00:00:55.680 --> 00:00:57.672
PATRICIA HELDING: Thank you.

00:00:57.672 --> 00:00:58.880
JEFF BUCHAN: So welcome, Pat.

00:00:58.880 --> 00:00:59.390
PATRICIA HELDING: Thank you.

00:00:59.390 --> 00:01:00.290
JEFF BUCHAN: Thanks
so much for coming in.

00:01:00.290 --> 00:01:00.970
It's great to see you.

00:01:00.970 --> 00:01:02.270
PATRICIA HELDING:
It's my pleasure.

00:01:02.270 --> 00:01:03.070
JEFF BUCHAN: I want to
start off by asking you

00:01:03.070 --> 00:01:05.610
a few questions
about your background

00:01:05.610 --> 00:01:08.090
and how Fat Witch came to be.

00:01:08.090 --> 00:01:10.320
You made a pretty interesting
and probably uncommon

00:01:10.320 --> 00:01:12.320
transition going
from Wall Street

00:01:12.320 --> 00:01:13.655
to opening your own bakery.

00:01:13.655 --> 00:01:16.030
So what made you want to leave
finance in the first place

00:01:16.030 --> 00:01:19.600
and open your own business,
and then why a bakery?

00:01:19.600 --> 00:01:21.060
PATRICIA HELDING: Good question.

00:01:21.060 --> 00:01:22.940
Normally when I'm asked
this question, Jeff,

00:01:22.940 --> 00:01:27.150
I usually give a
very upbeat answer.

00:01:27.150 --> 00:01:29.070
This time, with Google,
I'm going to tell you

00:01:29.070 --> 00:01:30.770
the down and dirty truth.

00:01:30.770 --> 00:01:31.160
JEFF BUCHAN: We get
the real answer.

00:01:31.160 --> 00:01:31.800
I like that.

00:01:31.800 --> 00:01:33.250
PATRICIA HELDING:
The real answer.

00:01:33.250 --> 00:01:37.940
I was a trader on Wall
Street, one of the first women

00:01:37.940 --> 00:01:42.920
to be a specialist
on equity options.

00:01:42.920 --> 00:01:46.260
Loved it, but I have to
say, trading finances

00:01:46.260 --> 00:01:48.090
is not the most
satisfying thing.

00:01:48.090 --> 00:01:53.020
It can be exciting, but it's
not the most satisfying.

00:01:53.020 --> 00:01:55.620
I did recognize a certain
bubble in the market,

00:01:55.620 --> 00:01:59.350
and I set up all the positions
for it and made a lot of money

00:01:59.350 --> 00:02:00.710
for the firm.

00:02:00.710 --> 00:02:02.480
And when that
money, those profits

00:02:02.480 --> 00:02:04.740
were distributed
among all the traders,

00:02:04.740 --> 00:02:08.220
I decided I was going
to run my own business.

00:02:08.220 --> 00:02:11.640
And that's when I
started Fat Witch.

00:02:11.640 --> 00:02:12.340
Why a bakery?

00:02:12.340 --> 00:02:16.220
I had a great brownie recipe,
and I put one and one together

00:02:16.220 --> 00:02:17.915
and said, this is
what I'm going to do.

00:02:17.915 --> 00:02:19.530
JEFF BUCHAN: That's great.

00:02:19.530 --> 00:02:22.540
So in opening and operating
your own business,

00:02:22.540 --> 00:02:25.680
what would you say has been
the single largest challenge

00:02:25.680 --> 00:02:27.319
in making that happen?

00:02:27.319 --> 00:02:29.360
For those of us interested
in potentially opening

00:02:29.360 --> 00:02:30.535
our own business one day.

00:02:30.535 --> 00:02:31.410
PATRICIA HELDING: OK.

00:02:31.410 --> 00:02:35.200
I think the hardest
thing is to get started.

00:02:35.200 --> 00:02:38.262
You've got to really believe
this is what you want to do.

00:02:38.262 --> 00:02:39.720
What I've seen with
people who want

00:02:39.720 --> 00:02:43.180
to open their own business,
they do a ton of research

00:02:43.180 --> 00:02:45.400
or they just plunge ahead.

00:02:45.400 --> 00:02:48.760
And you've got to get
somewhere in between.

00:02:48.760 --> 00:02:52.150
So I think that's the
advice I would give anybody.

00:02:52.150 --> 00:02:53.490
JEFF BUCHAN: Gotcha.

00:02:53.490 --> 00:02:55.240
Were you always a good cook?

00:02:55.240 --> 00:02:57.030
Is it something that
you did before you

00:02:57.030 --> 00:02:58.280
started to do it for a living?

00:02:58.280 --> 00:03:00.604
Was it something you
always had a knack for?

00:03:00.604 --> 00:03:01.520
PATRICIA HELDING: Yes.

00:03:01.520 --> 00:03:03.270
I like to cook.

00:03:03.270 --> 00:03:04.500
I will admit it.

00:03:04.500 --> 00:03:05.370
Yes, I like to cook.

00:03:05.370 --> 00:03:07.020
I like to bake.

00:03:07.020 --> 00:03:08.780
Always have.

00:03:08.780 --> 00:03:12.630
My plan B, if the brownie
business didn't work out,

00:03:12.630 --> 00:03:17.852
I was going to be a chef on
a yacht in the Caribbean.

00:03:17.852 --> 00:03:19.310
No, I'm so glad it
didn't work out,

00:03:19.310 --> 00:03:21.050
because I can't take the sun.

00:03:21.050 --> 00:03:22.449
It was a comfort.

00:03:22.449 --> 00:03:23.990
But I don't know
what I was thinking.

00:03:23.990 --> 00:03:25.197
It gave me comfort.

00:03:25.197 --> 00:03:26.280
JEFF BUCHAN: That's great.

00:03:26.280 --> 00:03:27.710
Well, I ask the question
coming from someone

00:03:27.710 --> 00:03:28.660
who is the opposite.

00:03:28.660 --> 00:03:30.720
I'm probably the worst
cook in the world.

00:03:30.720 --> 00:03:33.664
So that's where I'm coming from.

00:03:33.664 --> 00:03:34.580
PATRICIA HELDING: You?

00:03:34.580 --> 00:03:35.291
JEFF BUCHAN: Yes.

00:03:35.291 --> 00:03:35.790
Pretty bad.

00:03:35.790 --> 00:03:37.955
Pretty bad.

00:03:37.955 --> 00:03:39.830
One thing I'm really
interested in personally

00:03:39.830 --> 00:03:41.690
is how was the Fat
Witch brand born?

00:03:41.690 --> 00:03:44.530
Such a cool logo and brand.

00:03:44.530 --> 00:03:47.060
Where did the idea come from?

00:03:47.060 --> 00:03:51.310
PATRICIA HELDING: I became
fascinated with branding.

00:03:51.310 --> 00:03:56.030
Since we had no marketing
budget, no money whatsoever,

00:03:56.030 --> 00:03:57.090
I did the logo myself.

00:04:00.600 --> 00:04:02.620
Somewhere I got the
original drawing,

00:04:02.620 --> 00:04:06.200
but it's been vectored out
in all sorts of things since.

00:04:09.330 --> 00:04:12.060
Instead of reading cookbooks,
I was reading branding books.

00:04:12.060 --> 00:04:14.730
I probably read 100 or so.

00:04:14.730 --> 00:04:18.746
I would say my inspiration is
Starbucks and Howard Schultz.

00:04:18.746 --> 00:04:19.579
JEFF BUCHAN: Really?

00:04:19.579 --> 00:04:21.245
PATRICIA HELDING:
Well, you, think about

00:04:21.245 --> 00:04:24.830
it-- a cup of coffee and
what they've done with that.

00:04:24.830 --> 00:04:29.350
So that was my
inspiration to start it.

00:04:29.350 --> 00:04:31.470
And branding is much
more complicated

00:04:31.470 --> 00:04:35.620
than one would think at Google.

00:04:35.620 --> 00:04:37.120
JEFF BUCHAN: That's great.

00:04:37.120 --> 00:04:41.320
I consider myself a
dessert enthusiast.

00:04:41.320 --> 00:04:43.340
And I can honestly
say that Fat Witch

00:04:43.340 --> 00:04:45.687
brownies are my favorite
brownies in New York City.

00:04:45.687 --> 00:04:47.770
You guys have had a lot
of success over the years.

00:04:47.770 --> 00:04:49.144
Was there a certain
tipping point

00:04:49.144 --> 00:04:52.730
that you can identify where you
thought the bakery has really

00:04:52.730 --> 00:04:54.625
taken off?

00:04:54.625 --> 00:04:56.750
PATRICIA HELDING: That's
a hard question to answer.

00:04:56.750 --> 00:04:59.090
Very good question, but
it's pretty hard to answer.

00:04:59.090 --> 00:05:02.610
Because it was
really slow at first.

00:05:02.610 --> 00:05:05.660
And now you see Chelsea
Market bustling and hustling,

00:05:05.660 --> 00:05:07.840
but it was not always that way.

00:05:07.840 --> 00:05:12.470
One Sunday, we did
$43 worth of business.

00:05:12.470 --> 00:05:13.710
That was pretty scary.

00:05:13.710 --> 00:05:18.980
Now when-- I'd say probably
a number of years ago,

00:05:18.980 --> 00:05:21.150
we started, oh my goodness,
we did twice as much

00:05:21.150 --> 00:05:24.840
as we did a year ago on
that particular date.

00:05:24.840 --> 00:05:29.300
And now when I see things revert
back to maybe two years ago,

00:05:29.300 --> 00:05:30.590
I'm in the panic.

00:05:30.590 --> 00:05:33.100
So I can't really
say what success is.

00:05:33.100 --> 00:05:33.914
I don't know.

00:05:33.914 --> 00:05:35.330
JEFF BUCHAN: It's
a moving target.

00:05:35.330 --> 00:05:36.288
PATRICIA HELDING: Yeah.

00:05:36.288 --> 00:05:38.462
Perfect, yes.

00:05:38.462 --> 00:05:40.670
JEFF BUCHAN: Your store is
located conveniently close

00:05:40.670 --> 00:05:43.000
the Google office in Chelsea
Market, which we certainly

00:05:43.000 --> 00:05:45.360
love.

00:05:45.360 --> 00:05:47.500
What has it meant to you
to be part of the Chelsea

00:05:47.500 --> 00:05:50.083
community, and more specifically
the Chelsea Market community,

00:05:50.083 --> 00:05:52.190
for so many years now?

00:05:52.190 --> 00:05:55.410
PATRICIA HELDING: I'm going
to answer that question

00:05:55.410 --> 00:05:57.330
by talking about Google.

00:05:57.330 --> 00:06:01.340
Because we used to bake across
the street in Chelsea Market.

00:06:01.340 --> 00:06:04.970
And basically, we would sell
all day and bake all night.

00:06:04.970 --> 00:06:09.020
And Google was on
the second floor.

00:06:09.020 --> 00:06:10.900
We were on the first floor.

00:06:10.900 --> 00:06:14.700
And one day, this woman
came in, and she said,

00:06:14.700 --> 00:06:17.320
I'd like you to come
upstairs with me.

00:06:17.320 --> 00:06:18.330
And so I did.

00:06:18.330 --> 00:06:20.740
It was my first time at Google.

00:06:20.740 --> 00:06:26.380
And we went to this brick wall,
and it reeked of chocolate.

00:06:26.380 --> 00:06:28.460
It was just so strong.

00:06:28.460 --> 00:06:29.440
It was unbelievable.

00:06:29.440 --> 00:06:31.590
It was almost like the bakery.

00:06:31.590 --> 00:06:35.711
So that was a great moment
at Google, and I thank you.

00:06:35.711 --> 00:06:37.460
And I don't know whether
it's still there,

00:06:37.460 --> 00:06:40.490
because we no longer
bake in Chelsea Market.

00:06:40.490 --> 00:06:44.020
We have expanded
facilities uptown.

00:06:44.020 --> 00:06:48.751
But it's been a great
relationship ever since.

00:06:48.751 --> 00:06:51.250
JEFF BUCHAN: And so do you feel
a large sense of camaraderie

00:06:51.250 --> 00:06:53.892
with the other businesses
in Chelsea Market?

00:06:53.892 --> 00:06:56.100
Because you guys have been
there for a long time now.

00:06:56.100 --> 00:06:58.300
Not always the case in
the other locations.

00:06:58.300 --> 00:07:01.117
Do you coordinate a lot with
the other business owners

00:07:01.117 --> 00:07:02.950
and things like that,
or is it just everyone

00:07:02.950 --> 00:07:05.114
running their own
separate shops?

00:07:05.114 --> 00:07:06.905
PATRICIA HELDING: It's
pretty much everyone

00:07:06.905 --> 00:07:08.390
is running their own shop.

00:07:08.390 --> 00:07:14.300
I think the management really
coordinates things over there.

00:07:14.300 --> 00:07:18.000
So we try to be good neighbors.

00:07:18.000 --> 00:07:20.270
We let the flower shop
come in and use our water

00:07:20.270 --> 00:07:24.290
and take gallons of water out.

00:07:24.290 --> 00:07:27.450
But it's really management that
does most of that coordination.

00:07:27.450 --> 00:07:28.630
JEFF BUCHAN: Gotcha.

00:07:28.630 --> 00:07:32.390
Any plans to expand with any
additional Fat Witch locations

00:07:32.390 --> 00:07:33.290
potentially?

00:07:33.290 --> 00:07:35.440
PATRICIA HELDING: We
would love to expand.

00:07:35.440 --> 00:07:37.480
We have a financial
hurdle to get over,

00:07:37.480 --> 00:07:40.810
and then we hope to open
up more stores in New York

00:07:40.810 --> 00:07:41.737
pretty rapidly.

00:07:41.737 --> 00:07:42.570
JEFF BUCHAN: Gotcha.

00:07:42.570 --> 00:07:43.687
Very cool.

00:07:43.687 --> 00:07:46.270
One thing the last time we spoke
that I found very interesting

00:07:46.270 --> 00:07:49.580
is that you mentioned Fat Witch
has a very large following

00:07:49.580 --> 00:07:54.140
in Japan, which I found
surprising and really

00:07:54.140 --> 00:07:55.090
interesting.

00:07:55.090 --> 00:07:57.280
Any plans to do more
there, potentially open up

00:07:57.280 --> 00:08:00.160
a shop overseas in Japan?

00:08:00.160 --> 00:08:03.110
PATRICIA HELDING:
Thank you for asking.

00:08:03.110 --> 00:08:08.140
I just got back
from Japan, and we

00:08:08.140 --> 00:08:11.860
hope to partner-- the
final agreement has not

00:08:11.860 --> 00:08:16.870
been done-- but we hope to
partner with a butter factory

00:08:16.870 --> 00:08:20.520
and bakery in Japan.

00:08:20.520 --> 00:08:21.440
Yeah.

00:08:21.440 --> 00:08:22.220
It's fascinating.

00:08:22.220 --> 00:08:30.440
And the reason we have so many
Japanese customers from Japan

00:08:30.440 --> 00:08:34.440
is that in Japan, they
have a culture of cute.

00:08:34.440 --> 00:08:37.330
And you have to
think of Hello Kitty.

00:08:37.330 --> 00:08:43.460
Even their UPS
transportation company,

00:08:43.460 --> 00:08:47.760
their logo is a kitten
holding a baby kitten.

00:08:47.760 --> 00:08:51.090
So it's called kawaii.

00:08:51.090 --> 00:08:54.420
If you've been to Japan, you'll
see lots of kawaii around.

00:08:54.420 --> 00:08:58.420
And I think the first
five years or so, I

00:08:58.420 --> 00:09:00.060
pictured there were
lots of brownies

00:09:00.060 --> 00:09:05.020
sitting at people's bookshelves
just for kawaii sake.

00:09:05.020 --> 00:09:07.140
And I've never eaten,
but I think we're

00:09:07.140 --> 00:09:09.030
getting people to eat them now.

00:09:09.030 --> 00:09:11.877
Because chocolate is
new to Asia, by the way.

00:09:11.877 --> 00:09:13.210
JEFF BUCHAN: That's interesting.

00:09:13.210 --> 00:09:14.270
That's probably
one of those things

00:09:14.270 --> 00:09:16.069
that you could never
have anticipated

00:09:16.069 --> 00:09:17.360
when you started your business.

00:09:17.360 --> 00:09:20.140
But interesting to see
how Japanese clientele

00:09:20.140 --> 00:09:21.540
is a really big thing for you.

00:09:21.540 --> 00:09:22.706
PATRICIA HELDING: It is big.

00:09:22.706 --> 00:09:27.900
And we target some things
for that clientele.

00:09:27.900 --> 00:09:32.640
The candy that we do, those
little two-inch cube boxes,

00:09:32.640 --> 00:09:38.360
that is targeted for Japanese
from Japan so they can take

00:09:38.360 --> 00:09:42.466
omiyage back to Japan as a gift.

00:09:42.466 --> 00:09:43.704
JEFF BUCHAN: Very cool.

00:09:43.704 --> 00:09:45.370
I know from working
with you in the past

00:09:45.370 --> 00:09:46.970
that you are very tech forward.

00:09:50.790 --> 00:09:52.001
I'm saying that seriously.

00:09:52.001 --> 00:09:53.750
When you have your own
business and you're

00:09:53.750 --> 00:09:56.830
everything from the
CEO to the head cook,

00:09:56.830 --> 00:09:58.705
it's not easy to make
time for new technology

00:09:58.705 --> 00:10:00.260
and experimenting,
but I think you

00:10:00.260 --> 00:10:01.350
do a really good job with that.

00:10:01.350 --> 00:10:02.660
Can you talk a little
bit about the role

00:10:02.660 --> 00:10:04.500
that technology and
the internet has

00:10:04.500 --> 00:10:06.717
had in growing your business?

00:10:06.717 --> 00:10:08.300
PATRICIA HELDING: I
think if you don't

00:10:08.300 --> 00:10:10.290
have any technology
in your business,

00:10:10.290 --> 00:10:13.550
you really don't
have a business.

00:10:13.550 --> 00:10:18.420
I'm just laughing because I
feel we're so behind the times.

00:10:18.420 --> 00:10:21.230
And then you just told me
earlier that other people

00:10:21.230 --> 00:10:23.050
that you work with
are really behind.

00:10:23.050 --> 00:10:24.840
I thought, oh my goodness.

00:10:24.840 --> 00:10:28.080
I can't believe that
we were-- we want

00:10:28.080 --> 00:10:30.900
to get much more tech forward.

00:10:30.900 --> 00:10:33.890
I always get good ideas from
Google and participating

00:10:33.890 --> 00:10:35.950
in some of your
seminars and things.

00:10:38.920 --> 00:10:42.917
I have a vision of a production
room that's got computers,

00:10:42.917 --> 00:10:45.250
and you just type in the
recipe that you're going to do,

00:10:45.250 --> 00:10:51.210
and it comes up with visuals
of how to do it as well

00:10:51.210 --> 00:10:52.610
as a lot of stuff in the store.

00:10:52.610 --> 00:10:55.070
So we'd like to be much more.

00:10:55.070 --> 00:10:57.570
JEFF BUCHAN: When you are
baking, how much of it

00:10:57.570 --> 00:11:01.950
is a measured science versus
just an art where you're still

00:11:01.950 --> 00:11:02.680
experimenting?

00:11:02.680 --> 00:11:05.570
Is it very calculated where
everything is the same,

00:11:05.570 --> 00:11:09.000
or is it more experimentation,
trying new things?

00:11:09.000 --> 00:11:12.360
PATRICIA HELDING: Baking is
more scientific than cooking.

00:11:12.360 --> 00:11:15.310
You can mess around
with a marinara sauce

00:11:15.310 --> 00:11:18.230
far more than you
can a brownie recipe.

00:11:18.230 --> 00:11:24.760
Once you get the recipe set, it
is done by pounds and ounces.

00:11:24.760 --> 00:11:27.880
We don't take two
eggs and break them.

00:11:27.880 --> 00:11:34.230
It's eight pounds of eggs,
because we're doing 80 quarts

00:11:34.230 --> 00:11:35.490
at a time.

00:11:35.490 --> 00:11:37.820
So it has to be measured.

00:11:37.820 --> 00:11:40.095
That doesn't mean we don't
experiment with recipes.

00:11:42.850 --> 00:11:46.280
I always believe I've never
seen a recipe I can't change.

00:11:46.280 --> 00:11:50.540
But once it's set,
particularly being commercial,

00:11:50.540 --> 00:11:53.949
we have to make that
the same way each time.

00:11:53.949 --> 00:11:55.490
JEFF BUCHAN: And
coming from finance,

00:11:55.490 --> 00:11:58.031
I'm sure you're familiar with
the idea of economies of scale.

00:11:58.031 --> 00:12:02.340
It seems like baking
is a lot about that,

00:12:02.340 --> 00:12:05.050
estimating demand
and things like that.

00:12:05.050 --> 00:12:07.460
Is that difficult to do?

00:12:07.460 --> 00:12:10.000
I would assume that demand
swings from day to day and week

00:12:10.000 --> 00:12:11.160
to week.

00:12:11.160 --> 00:12:15.642
How do you go about the process
of estimating how many brownies

00:12:15.642 --> 00:12:18.100
are we going to sell today,
how many do we need to produce?

00:12:18.100 --> 00:12:20.340
PATRICIA HELDING: That
is such a good question.

00:12:20.340 --> 00:12:23.109
Now I'm going to have to
tell you another secret.

00:12:23.109 --> 00:12:23.900
JEFF BUCHAN: Uh oh.

00:12:23.900 --> 00:12:24.400
Don't tell.

00:12:24.400 --> 00:12:25.110
Nobody tell.

00:12:25.110 --> 00:12:26.550
PATRICIA HELDING: OK.

00:12:26.550 --> 00:12:28.450
This is how we do it.

00:12:28.450 --> 00:12:33.350
We bake, we let it cool
down, we cut the brownies,

00:12:33.350 --> 00:12:37.780
we wrap the brownies,
they go in the freezer,

00:12:37.780 --> 00:12:39.650
and it's stacked up.

00:12:39.650 --> 00:12:43.220
So we pull out what
we need for the day.

00:12:43.220 --> 00:12:44.800
You've never known
that those don't

00:12:44.800 --> 00:12:47.700
come directly out of the oven.

00:12:47.700 --> 00:12:50.880
The unwrapped ones
that we have do.

00:12:50.880 --> 00:12:54.000
That we juggle, and we run
out of stuff all the time.

00:12:54.000 --> 00:12:55.410
Because you're so right.

00:12:55.410 --> 00:12:56.410
JEFF BUCHAN: It's tough.

00:12:56.410 --> 00:12:58.201
PATRICIA HELDING: It's
tough thing to call.

00:12:58.201 --> 00:13:00.880
And one day, everybody
wants the vegan brownies,

00:13:00.880 --> 00:13:05.880
and the next day
it's the coffee one.

00:13:05.880 --> 00:13:07.310
It's very hard.

00:13:07.310 --> 00:13:09.280
But that's the way we do it.

00:13:09.280 --> 00:13:11.880
Even for Japan-- we're
there twice a year

00:13:11.880 --> 00:13:17.150
for food shows-- we
have it flash frozen,

00:13:17.150 --> 00:13:21.220
it gets picked up by a
truck, in a frozen truck,

00:13:21.220 --> 00:13:25.370
goes to the dock in New Jersey,
still frozen, down the Atlantic

00:13:25.370 --> 00:13:29.300
Ocean, across the Panama Canal,
across the Pacific Ocean.

00:13:29.300 --> 00:13:31.130
It takes four weeks.

00:13:31.130 --> 00:13:32.950
I've met it in Yokohama.

00:13:32.950 --> 00:13:35.010
They're fine.

00:13:35.010 --> 00:13:37.400
You would never know.

00:13:37.400 --> 00:13:39.747
We flash freeze everything
is the real truth.

00:13:39.747 --> 00:13:40.580
JEFF BUCHAN: Gotcha.

00:13:40.580 --> 00:13:41.240
I gotcha.

00:13:41.240 --> 00:13:43.210
What is the fan
favorite in the bakery,

00:13:43.210 --> 00:13:44.390
and what is your favorite?

00:13:46.627 --> 00:13:48.210
PATRICIA HELDING: I
would say probably

00:13:48.210 --> 00:13:52.260
the caramel witch is the fan--
didn't see people over there,

00:13:52.260 --> 00:13:53.809
sorry-- the fan favorite.

00:13:53.809 --> 00:13:55.350
JEFF BUCHAN: That's
my favorite, too.

00:13:55.350 --> 00:13:55.520
PATRICIA HELDING: Is it?

00:13:55.520 --> 00:13:56.206
JEFF BUCHAN: It is.

00:13:56.206 --> 00:13:57.081
PATRICIA HELDING: OK.

00:13:57.081 --> 00:13:59.580
Good to know.

00:13:59.580 --> 00:14:03.340
For me, I like whatever
we've just produced.

00:14:03.340 --> 00:14:06.700
The red velvet witch,
or we just did a witch

00:14:06.700 --> 00:14:09.910
with lavender extract in it.

00:14:12.800 --> 00:14:13.780
I'm pretty unfaithful.

00:14:16.975 --> 00:14:18.350
JEFF BUCHAN: Your
first cookbook,

00:14:18.350 --> 00:14:23.650
which came out in 2010,
you published the recipe

00:14:23.650 --> 00:14:25.370
for your famous brownies.

00:14:25.370 --> 00:14:27.735
Was that a hard
decision to publish

00:14:27.735 --> 00:14:29.610
that in a book for
everyone to see, something

00:14:29.610 --> 00:14:32.140
you struggled with, or
was that an obvious thing

00:14:32.140 --> 00:14:34.097
you knew you wanted to do?

00:14:34.097 --> 00:14:35.680
PATRICIA HELDING:
In a word, Jeff, no.

00:14:35.680 --> 00:14:37.410
It wasn't a problem.

00:14:37.410 --> 00:14:40.360
I think running a
business is-- the hook

00:14:40.360 --> 00:14:42.120
is running the business.

00:14:42.120 --> 00:14:51.200
My recipe-- with research, you
could duplicate a Fat Witch.

00:14:51.200 --> 00:14:54.640
When I was in Japan
in the butter factory,

00:14:54.640 --> 00:14:56.530
they said, oh, we've made it.

00:14:56.530 --> 00:14:58.160
We don't need your recipe.

00:14:58.160 --> 00:14:59.987
Because they can take it apart.

00:14:59.987 --> 00:15:01.570
Now, are you going
to do that at home?

00:15:01.570 --> 00:15:02.420
No.

00:15:02.420 --> 00:15:05.180
Are you going to build a
business out of brownies?

00:15:05.180 --> 00:15:06.530
Probably not.

00:15:06.530 --> 00:15:08.880
So the answer is no.

00:15:08.880 --> 00:15:09.380
It wasn't.

00:15:09.380 --> 00:15:10.720
JEFF BUCHAN: It's
more about just

00:15:10.720 --> 00:15:11.845
the brownies at this point.

00:15:11.845 --> 00:15:14.100
It's about the Fat Witch
brand and all the stuff

00:15:14.100 --> 00:15:15.636
that surrounds the brownies.

00:15:15.636 --> 00:15:16.594
PATRICIA HELDING: Yeah.

00:15:16.594 --> 00:15:18.080
JEFF BUCHAN: That's great.

00:15:18.080 --> 00:15:19.180
So now I'd like to
shift gears a little bit

00:15:19.180 --> 00:15:20.888
to talk about your
second cookbook, which

00:15:20.888 --> 00:15:21.825
we have right here.

00:15:21.825 --> 00:15:23.950
We also have these available
to purchase afterwards

00:15:23.950 --> 00:15:26.158
if you guys are interested,
which I highly recommend.

00:15:28.225 --> 00:15:29.850
What was the impetus
for this cookbook?

00:15:29.850 --> 00:15:32.300
Obviously, it was a different
focus than the first one.

00:15:32.300 --> 00:15:35.120
Where did the idea for
this cookbook come from?

00:15:35.120 --> 00:15:39.770
PATRICIA HELDING: The idea
came from my agent, which

00:15:39.770 --> 00:15:45.020
I can't believe I'm say I have
a literary agent, but I do.

00:15:45.020 --> 00:15:47.080
When she said you've got
to do another cookbook,

00:15:47.080 --> 00:15:49.270
I said, Sharon, huh?

00:15:49.270 --> 00:15:50.390
What?

00:15:50.390 --> 00:15:53.480
And I said, I told
you everything

00:15:53.480 --> 00:15:55.720
I know about baking,
about brownies.

00:15:55.720 --> 00:15:57.030
That was cookbook number one.

00:15:57.030 --> 00:16:00.160
And she said, do you
still bake at home?

00:16:00.160 --> 00:16:01.770
And I said, yeah, I do.

00:16:01.770 --> 00:16:03.230
And she said, go through that.

00:16:03.230 --> 00:16:06.310
So she came up with the
idea of "Bake Sale."

00:16:06.310 --> 00:16:10.540
And it's really my
stuff that I do at home.

00:16:10.540 --> 00:16:13.849
But we threw in lots of stuff.

00:16:13.849 --> 00:16:15.890
JEFF BUCHAN: A lot of
non-brownie items in there.

00:16:15.890 --> 00:16:17.120
PATRICIA HELDING: Yeah.

00:16:17.120 --> 00:16:18.380
We've got cake in there.

00:16:18.380 --> 00:16:20.930
It's the best chocolate cake
you're ever going to make.

00:16:24.530 --> 00:16:27.870
JEFF BUCHAN: What are some basic
ingredients that you recommend

00:16:27.870 --> 00:16:30.120
that people have on
hand just in case

00:16:30.120 --> 00:16:32.641
their children forget the
morning bake sale at the school

00:16:32.641 --> 00:16:34.890
or something like that, they
have to prepare something

00:16:34.890 --> 00:16:36.955
in a pinch.

00:16:36.955 --> 00:16:37.830
PATRICIA HELDING: OK.

00:16:37.830 --> 00:16:40.246
JEFF BUCHAN: Any must haves
that people should just always

00:16:40.246 --> 00:16:41.880
have on hand?

00:16:41.880 --> 00:16:45.100
PATRICIA HELDING:
Don't write this down.

00:16:45.100 --> 00:16:47.430
Instead of making
specifics, I'm going

00:16:47.430 --> 00:16:51.922
to give you five elements
that are good to have at home

00:16:51.922 --> 00:16:53.130
if you're ever going to bake.

00:16:53.130 --> 00:16:57.640
And you can make
a lot of things.

00:16:57.640 --> 00:17:00.192
The first is you have to have
something sweet if you're

00:17:00.192 --> 00:17:03.040
going to do a piece of pastry.

00:17:03.040 --> 00:17:05.940
And sweet doesn't have to
be white granulated sugar.

00:17:05.940 --> 00:17:07.819
It can be honey.

00:17:07.819 --> 00:17:12.140
It can be agave, which I hear
is your new sweet of choice

00:17:12.140 --> 00:17:13.720
here at Google.

00:17:13.720 --> 00:17:15.380
Wow.

00:17:15.380 --> 00:17:21.569
Brown rice syrup,
maple syrup can work.

00:17:21.569 --> 00:17:24.550
There's a lot of
things you can do.

00:17:24.550 --> 00:17:29.270
The next thing you
would need would be fat.

00:17:29.270 --> 00:17:33.210
And it doesn't
have to be butter.

00:17:33.210 --> 00:17:36.170
It can be a butter substitute.

00:17:36.170 --> 00:17:39.900
Earth Balance is a good one.

00:17:39.900 --> 00:17:44.740
I don't use margarine, but
that's an oil base fat.

00:17:44.740 --> 00:17:46.740
If you're vegan,
you probably already

00:17:46.740 --> 00:17:52.450
have a jar of coconut oil,
which I've learned to love.

00:17:52.450 --> 00:17:53.840
Amazing.

00:17:53.840 --> 00:17:56.610
And I did take a note on this.

00:17:56.610 --> 00:17:57.530
Canola oil.

00:17:57.530 --> 00:17:59.810
And there's lots of
other oils out there.

00:17:59.810 --> 00:18:01.600
You just have to
make sure-- olive oil

00:18:01.600 --> 00:18:05.270
I never use for baking, because
it has too much of a flavor.

00:18:05.270 --> 00:18:09.310
But canola is pretty neutral,
so you might want to do that.

00:18:09.310 --> 00:18:11.780
So that's two.

00:18:11.780 --> 00:18:15.440
Three would be eggs
or an egg substitute.

00:18:15.440 --> 00:18:19.700
Four would be flour.

00:18:19.700 --> 00:18:22.910
And flour is what binds
pastries together.

00:18:22.910 --> 00:18:25.510
I always thought it was eggs,
but it actually is flour.

00:18:25.510 --> 00:18:27.300
Who knew.

00:18:27.300 --> 00:18:30.800
So it can be with
gluten or gluten free.

00:18:30.800 --> 00:18:35.470
Just please make sure
if you use gluten free

00:18:35.470 --> 00:18:38.110
it's not cup for
cup substitution.

00:18:38.110 --> 00:18:42.300
You have to have a recipe
that's got gluten-free flour.

00:18:42.300 --> 00:18:46.080
Let me rephrase-- that
was specifically written

00:18:46.080 --> 00:18:49.510
for using gluten-free flour.

00:18:49.510 --> 00:18:52.790
And the last thing you need,
Jeff, to put in your cupboard

00:18:52.790 --> 00:18:54.990
is flavor.

00:18:54.990 --> 00:18:57.830
And of course, we
love chocolate.

00:18:57.830 --> 00:19:03.760
But it could be peanut butter,
strawberries, strawberry jam,

00:19:03.760 --> 00:19:05.940
whatever your flavor is.

00:19:05.940 --> 00:19:09.230
And you probably already
have things in your cupboard

00:19:09.230 --> 00:19:10.900
that would work.

00:19:10.900 --> 00:19:12.030
So it's not complicated.

00:19:12.030 --> 00:19:13.945
But just think of
those five elements.

00:19:13.945 --> 00:19:15.920
JEFF BUCHAN: That's
good to know.

00:19:15.920 --> 00:19:18.800
So this book, I think, really
has something for everyone.

00:19:18.800 --> 00:19:21.610
You break it down into
different categories--

00:19:21.610 --> 00:19:26.170
things like gluten-free recipes,
foreign recipes, kids recipes,

00:19:26.170 --> 00:19:27.149
et cetera.

00:19:27.149 --> 00:19:28.940
Are the different areas
that you broke down

00:19:28.940 --> 00:19:31.770
in the book-- are these areas
you're seeing a lot of demand

00:19:31.770 --> 00:19:33.927
from customers and that's
how you got the idea

00:19:33.927 --> 00:19:35.010
to break it down that way?

00:19:35.010 --> 00:19:37.740
Or what were you thinking there?

00:19:37.740 --> 00:19:39.240
PATRICIA HELDING:
Yes, I think there

00:19:39.240 --> 00:19:43.190
is a lot of demand for
things like gluten free.

00:19:43.190 --> 00:19:45.950
I put recipes in there,
and I do it at home

00:19:45.950 --> 00:19:49.570
even though I keep flour on
the premises, gluten flour.

00:19:49.570 --> 00:19:52.955
And please be careful
if you are a celiac

00:19:52.955 --> 00:19:56.640
or have a problem with gluten.

00:19:56.640 --> 00:19:59.380
Don't go to a bakery
that's got both.

00:19:59.380 --> 00:20:02.940
Because once it's in the air,
I don't care how many times

00:20:02.940 --> 00:20:04.090
you clean the equipment.

00:20:04.090 --> 00:20:07.750
It's major to
become gluten free.

00:20:07.750 --> 00:20:10.390
So if somebody says
they're gluten free

00:20:10.390 --> 00:20:16.411
and then they've got bread
next to it, it's probably not.

00:20:16.411 --> 00:20:19.070
But I think that's going
to get much stricter

00:20:19.070 --> 00:20:22.950
with the government soon.

00:20:22.950 --> 00:20:26.170
Vegan was new to me, and I
sort of turned up my nose,

00:20:26.170 --> 00:20:28.330
but it's fantastic.

00:20:28.330 --> 00:20:31.310
I love doing coconut oil.

00:20:31.310 --> 00:20:34.034
And you don't need
eggs for everything.

00:20:34.034 --> 00:20:36.450
JEFF BUCHAN: And you sell the
vegan brownies in your store

00:20:36.450 --> 00:20:37.130
now, right?

00:20:37.130 --> 00:20:37.620
PATRICIA HELDING: We do.

00:20:37.620 --> 00:20:39.040
JEFF BUCHAN: They're
pretty popular?

00:20:39.040 --> 00:20:39.956
PATRICIA HELDING: Yes.

00:20:39.956 --> 00:20:41.960
People are tweeting,
I got the last one.

00:20:41.960 --> 00:20:43.775
And I'm like, yay.

00:20:43.775 --> 00:20:47.030
That's great.

00:20:47.030 --> 00:20:50.780
JEFF BUCHAN: I am a very
amateur baker slash cook,

00:20:50.780 --> 00:20:53.370
and I'd say that's pretty
generous to put it that way.

00:20:53.370 --> 00:20:55.640
Are there any recipes in
this book that you recommend

00:20:55.640 --> 00:20:57.869
that even I could take on?

00:20:57.869 --> 00:20:59.910
PATRICIA HELDING: Most of
them you could take on.

00:20:59.910 --> 00:21:00.380
JEFF BUCHAN: Really?

00:21:00.380 --> 00:21:00.750
Even me?

00:21:00.750 --> 00:21:01.120
PATRICIA HELDING: Oh yeah.

00:21:01.120 --> 00:21:02.410
I promise you.

00:21:02.410 --> 00:21:05.480
There's one that's a no bake.

00:21:05.480 --> 00:21:07.420
You use rice crackers.

00:21:07.420 --> 00:21:09.960
Just dribble chocolate
on top of it.

00:21:09.960 --> 00:21:11.530
Fantastic.

00:21:11.530 --> 00:21:15.840
It's called the
toffee crunch chunks.

00:21:15.840 --> 00:21:16.532
Easy.

00:21:16.532 --> 00:21:18.490
JEFF BUCHAN: So if I were
to pick up this book,

00:21:18.490 --> 00:21:20.700
top three recommendations
for me, what would they be?

00:21:20.700 --> 00:21:26.980
PATRICIA HELDING: I'd
do the toffee crunch.

00:21:26.980 --> 00:21:28.390
I'd do vegan.

00:21:28.390 --> 00:21:29.740
Very easy.

00:21:29.740 --> 00:21:32.420
When I have a dinner
party, I never

00:21:32.420 --> 00:21:35.180
remember to bring
home brownies-- never.

00:21:35.180 --> 00:21:36.850
And I do the vegan.

00:21:36.850 --> 00:21:39.090
You can just knock it
together like that.

00:21:39.090 --> 00:21:45.410
And the third one, I don't know.

00:21:45.410 --> 00:21:49.610
Just look for something
really simple.

00:21:49.610 --> 00:21:52.074
I can't think of one
off the top of my head.

00:21:52.074 --> 00:21:54.490
JEFF BUCHAN: I think there
were some cinnamon toast crunch

00:21:54.490 --> 00:21:54.870
bars.

00:21:54.870 --> 00:21:56.040
PATRICIA HELDING: Cinnamon
toast, that's great.

00:21:56.040 --> 00:21:57.680
JEFF BUCHAN: Those
caught my eye.

00:21:57.680 --> 00:21:58.590
I might try those.

00:21:58.590 --> 00:22:00.173
PATRICIA HELDING:
That is really good.

00:22:00.173 --> 00:22:01.310
You have to like cinnamon.

00:22:01.310 --> 00:22:02.350
JEFF BUCHAN: I do.

00:22:02.350 --> 00:22:04.421
I just don't like--
baking is the issue.

00:22:04.421 --> 00:22:05.670
I'll let you know how it goes.

00:22:05.670 --> 00:22:07.170
PATRICIA HELDING:
These are easy.

00:22:07.170 --> 00:22:08.179
You'll get a test.

00:22:08.179 --> 00:22:09.220
JEFF BUCHAN: Sounds good.

00:22:09.220 --> 00:22:10.720
I want to make sure we
leave time for questions

00:22:10.720 --> 00:22:11.470
from the audience.

00:22:11.470 --> 00:22:12.990
So we have two
microphones there.

00:22:12.990 --> 00:22:15.281
You guys have any questions,
feel free to step right up

00:22:15.281 --> 00:22:17.230
and ask your question to Pat.

00:22:17.230 --> 00:22:21.419
In the meantime, I'll go
with one more from me.

00:22:21.419 --> 00:22:22.960
Any advice for people
who are looking

00:22:22.960 --> 00:22:24.779
to start their own business?

00:22:24.779 --> 00:22:26.070
We talked about the challenges.

00:22:26.070 --> 00:22:28.537
But what would your advice
be if some people are just

00:22:28.537 --> 00:22:30.120
starting to think
through that process

00:22:30.120 --> 00:22:33.370
and think it's something
they might want to pursue.

00:22:33.370 --> 00:22:36.050
PATRICIA HELDING: I think,
as I said before, it's good

00:22:36.050 --> 00:22:37.350
do some research.

00:22:37.350 --> 00:22:39.840
It's a lot easier to
do that research now

00:22:39.840 --> 00:22:46.000
than it was 15, 20 years ago.

00:22:46.000 --> 00:22:49.450
I think perhaps the
most important thing

00:22:49.450 --> 00:22:57.150
would be to have the
finished project in mind.

00:22:57.150 --> 00:22:57.980
What you want?

00:22:57.980 --> 00:22:59.290
Do you want a store?

00:22:59.290 --> 00:23:01.040
Do you want to
just do wholesale?

00:23:01.040 --> 00:23:03.440
Do you want to consult
with this person?

00:23:03.440 --> 00:23:04.300
Whatever.

00:23:04.300 --> 00:23:06.380
Have that in mind, and
then you can backtrack

00:23:06.380 --> 00:23:09.150
of what you need to get there.

00:23:09.150 --> 00:23:11.470
And then once you
have that business

00:23:11.470 --> 00:23:15.420
plan ready, be prepared
to change everything.

00:23:15.420 --> 00:23:17.240
You're going to
have to shift gears,

00:23:17.240 --> 00:23:19.470
because things are
going to change.

00:23:19.470 --> 00:23:22.730
I didn't know the Japanese from
Japan were going to come in.

00:23:22.730 --> 00:23:24.380
JEFF BUCHAN: Great.

00:23:24.380 --> 00:23:25.395
That's great.

00:23:25.395 --> 00:23:26.520
Question over there, Carly.

00:23:26.520 --> 00:23:28.830
AUDIENCE: My question
actually builds on that.

00:23:28.830 --> 00:23:32.651
How easy or hard is to start
a business in New York City?

00:23:32.651 --> 00:23:34.900
You could have done this in
a lot of different cities.

00:23:34.900 --> 00:23:37.070
It could have been
more challenging.

00:23:37.070 --> 00:23:41.370
Or maybe because of the foot
traffic of where you chose,

00:23:41.370 --> 00:23:43.630
Chelsea Market ended up being
a really smart decision.

00:23:43.630 --> 00:23:45.421
Can you tell us a little
bit about New York

00:23:45.421 --> 00:23:46.730
City versus another place?

00:23:46.730 --> 00:23:48.544
And then also, why
Chelsea Market?

00:23:48.544 --> 00:23:50.210
Because you mentioned
you were a trader,

00:23:50.210 --> 00:23:53.300
and you obviously knew
downtown, even further downtown.

00:23:53.300 --> 00:23:54.010
Why here?

00:23:54.010 --> 00:23:55.502
What was the connection?

00:23:55.502 --> 00:23:57.310
PATRICIA HELDING: Wow.

00:23:57.310 --> 00:24:00.265
I think New York is
difficult, particularly

00:24:00.265 --> 00:24:01.770
in the food business.

00:24:01.770 --> 00:24:06.210
I will tell you that from
what I hear from inspectors

00:24:06.210 --> 00:24:11.920
and also from people who deliver
our ingredients, we're cleaner,

00:24:11.920 --> 00:24:14.540
believe it or not, than
a lot of other cities,

00:24:14.540 --> 00:24:16.530
a lot of other places.

00:24:16.530 --> 00:24:22.620
The inspection is tough,
and it's thorough.

00:24:22.620 --> 00:24:28.270
So we can't have anything
on the floor, whatever.

00:24:28.270 --> 00:24:29.580
So New York is tough.

00:24:29.580 --> 00:24:32.300
It's probably the toughest
in the United States

00:24:32.300 --> 00:24:33.740
in terms of food.

00:24:33.740 --> 00:24:36.610
Rents are probably higher
than any other place

00:24:36.610 --> 00:24:40.770
except for probably
Alaska and Hawaii.

00:24:40.770 --> 00:24:44.360
But you get foot traffic here.

00:24:44.360 --> 00:24:45.470
People are on their feet.

00:24:45.470 --> 00:24:49.980
If you take Los Angeles, for
instance, people are in a car.

00:24:49.980 --> 00:24:54.280
So I just thought, well,
I know New York better.

00:24:54.280 --> 00:24:57.340
So that would be the reason.

00:24:57.340 --> 00:24:58.310
And I live here.

00:25:02.820 --> 00:25:07.890
Chelsea Market, when it first
opened, was inexpensive.

00:25:07.890 --> 00:25:12.530
And they wanted people to come
in and produce food there.

00:25:12.530 --> 00:25:17.258
So it is much,
much different now.

00:25:17.258 --> 00:25:18.950
AUDIENCE: Thank you.

00:25:18.950 --> 00:25:20.750
PATRICIA HELDING: Thank you.

00:25:20.750 --> 00:25:21.346
AUDIENCE: Hi.

00:25:21.346 --> 00:25:22.220
PATRICIA HELDING: Hi.

00:25:22.220 --> 00:25:25.310
AUDIENCE: So a follow up to
your business plan question.

00:25:25.310 --> 00:25:28.470
I know there are certain things
you couldn't account for,

00:25:28.470 --> 00:25:31.790
like your Japanese expansion.

00:25:31.790 --> 00:25:35.630
But aside from that, when
you were doing your business

00:25:35.630 --> 00:25:37.830
planning, did you make
a conscious effort,

00:25:37.830 --> 00:25:41.430
like I'm going to
keep this small

00:25:41.430 --> 00:25:44.640
and contained, or I
want global domination?

00:25:47.950 --> 00:25:50.530
PATRICIA HELDING: Very good.

00:25:50.530 --> 00:25:53.730
I don't think global
domination ever occurred to me,

00:25:53.730 --> 00:25:58.350
but I wanted to be-- I wanted
to be the brownie that you

00:25:58.350 --> 00:26:00.510
would go to.

00:26:00.510 --> 00:26:02.880
I think that those are
really good elements

00:26:02.880 --> 00:26:05.560
to put into your business plan.

00:26:05.560 --> 00:26:08.970
And then depending on
how you get your funding,

00:26:08.970 --> 00:26:12.530
that is going to affect that.

00:26:12.530 --> 00:26:14.730
What is the finished
product going to look like?

00:26:14.730 --> 00:26:17.930
We're nowhere near
our finished project.

00:26:17.930 --> 00:26:21.360
We've got stores to
build and things to do.

00:26:21.360 --> 00:26:23.360
I'm going to be back
in Japan in September

00:26:23.360 --> 00:26:27.670
and maybe Dubai with partners.

00:26:27.670 --> 00:26:32.690
So we're still a
work in progress.

00:26:32.690 --> 00:26:37.130
But I think the more you can
put those elements in early on,

00:26:37.130 --> 00:26:39.600
you're going to be shocked 10
years later at how much it's

00:26:39.600 --> 00:26:40.950
changed.

00:26:40.950 --> 00:26:44.190
But try to get them in.

00:26:44.190 --> 00:26:45.860
You want to get your
demographics in,

00:26:45.860 --> 00:26:48.950
you want to get who your
clients are going to be.

00:26:48.950 --> 00:26:50.395
And this is part of branding.

00:26:52.930 --> 00:26:56.960
You want to know what they buy.

00:26:56.960 --> 00:26:59.090
Google, you guys
are great at that.

00:26:59.090 --> 00:27:01.180
So there you are.

00:27:01.180 --> 00:27:03.570
AUDIENCE: Do you do
demographic analysis constantly

00:27:03.570 --> 00:27:07.214
just so that you understand
your changing client base?

00:27:07.214 --> 00:27:09.130
PATRICIA HELDING: Not
on a professional level.

00:27:13.390 --> 00:27:16.234
But it's really more a gut feel.

00:27:16.234 --> 00:27:18.650
JEFF BUCHAN: So anecdotally,
when people come in the door.

00:27:18.650 --> 00:27:19.280
PATRICIA HELDING: Yeah.

00:27:19.280 --> 00:27:21.060
And that's why I'm
in the bakery a lot,

00:27:21.060 --> 00:27:25.650
just to talk to people,
that kind of thing.

00:27:25.650 --> 00:27:28.010
But I don't know.

00:27:28.010 --> 00:27:31.100
I guess we've done some
surveys and things,

00:27:31.100 --> 00:27:36.290
but it's hard to
get the whole reach.

00:27:36.290 --> 00:27:40.202
For us, we're pretty tiny.

00:27:40.202 --> 00:27:41.910
JEFF BUCHAN: Another
question over there.

00:27:41.910 --> 00:27:44.012
AUDIENCE: I have two
questions if that's OK.

00:27:44.012 --> 00:27:44.970
PATRICIA HELDING: Sure.

00:27:44.970 --> 00:27:47.000
AUDIENCE: First, pretty
straightforward--

00:27:47.000 --> 00:27:49.350
what is your process for
coming up with the new recipes?

00:27:49.350 --> 00:27:51.410
Are you personally
coming up with all

00:27:51.410 --> 00:27:52.965
these new
combinations, or do you

00:27:52.965 --> 00:27:54.480
have a team of
helpers and tasters

00:27:54.480 --> 00:27:58.270
and people with their ear to
the ground on new flavors?

00:27:58.270 --> 00:28:00.770
PATRICIA HELDING: I have
a production manager,

00:28:00.770 --> 00:28:04.170
and she knows far more
about baking than I do.

00:28:04.170 --> 00:28:07.390
And this is also built
into my business plan,

00:28:07.390 --> 00:28:11.430
that I knew I have no
training in baking.

00:28:11.430 --> 00:28:15.650
I didn't know what a
commercial oven was.

00:28:15.650 --> 00:28:20.490
But that's plunge
ahead and go do it.

00:28:20.490 --> 00:28:22.480
So she knows much more.

00:28:22.480 --> 00:28:25.470
Strangely enough-- she's a
graduate of Hyde Park Culinary

00:28:25.470 --> 00:28:32.010
Institute, which is the
highest of the high in food

00:28:32.010 --> 00:28:34.150
in the United States.

00:28:34.150 --> 00:28:35.480
I'm the one with two cookbooks.

00:28:35.480 --> 00:28:36.670
Go figure.

00:28:36.670 --> 00:28:38.560
Life is strange that way.

00:28:38.560 --> 00:28:42.220
But we collaborate, and then
we test on our employees

00:28:42.220 --> 00:28:44.400
all the time.

00:28:44.400 --> 00:28:46.560
And in the bakery,
too, sometimes.

00:28:46.560 --> 00:28:48.960
JEFF BUCHAN: If you ever
need any extra testers,

00:28:48.960 --> 00:28:50.120
you know where we are.

00:28:50.120 --> 00:28:50.560
PATRICIA HELDING: OK.

00:28:50.560 --> 00:28:51.060
Good.

00:28:51.060 --> 00:28:52.070
We'll bring it over.

00:28:52.070 --> 00:28:55.210
AUDIENCE: I actually
have three questions.

00:28:55.210 --> 00:28:57.345
I came up with another one.

00:28:57.345 --> 00:28:59.220
I haven't looked at the
book yet, but I will.

00:28:59.220 --> 00:29:01.247
You have all these
different variations.

00:29:01.247 --> 00:29:03.580
And I'm just thinking that
"The New York Times" just did

00:29:03.580 --> 00:29:06.360
a thing on what makes
a sandwich a sandwich.

00:29:06.360 --> 00:29:08.150
At what point is a
brownie not a brownie?

00:29:08.150 --> 00:29:09.600
What's a brownie
versus a cookie?

00:29:09.600 --> 00:29:14.910
Is it the ingredients in it,
the shape, the squareness?

00:29:14.910 --> 00:29:18.630
PATRICIA HELDING: They think
that brownies were invented

00:29:18.630 --> 00:29:22.460
by somebody who forgot to
put baking powder or baking

00:29:22.460 --> 00:29:25.230
soda into a cake.

00:29:25.230 --> 00:29:28.310
And there's no written
history of this,

00:29:28.310 --> 00:29:30.990
but they think that it
was like a fallen cake.

00:29:30.990 --> 00:29:32.990
And it was in the
United States for sure.

00:29:32.990 --> 00:29:35.370
That's the only thing we know.

00:29:35.370 --> 00:29:39.345
And it is one of our few
American-based pastries, that

00:29:39.345 --> 00:29:40.900
and chocolate chip cookies.

00:29:40.900 --> 00:29:42.275
Because most of
our pastries here

00:29:42.275 --> 00:29:46.800
are based on either German,
Austrian, or French,

00:29:46.800 --> 00:29:48.054
and now some Japanese.

00:29:48.054 --> 00:29:48.595
AUDIENCE: OK.

00:29:48.595 --> 00:29:50.335
I'll let someone
else ask a question.

00:29:50.335 --> 00:29:51.129
Thank you.

00:29:51.129 --> 00:29:52.295
PATRICIA HELDING: Thank you.

00:29:52.295 --> 00:29:52.700
AUDIENCE: Hi.

00:29:52.700 --> 00:29:53.320
PATRICIA HELDING: Hi.

00:29:53.320 --> 00:29:54.570
AUDIENCE: I just sampled
your vegan brownie,

00:29:54.570 --> 00:29:55.514
and it was delicious.

00:29:55.514 --> 00:29:55.986
PATRICIA HELDING: Thank you.

00:29:55.986 --> 00:29:56.930
AUDIENCE: Thank you.

00:29:56.930 --> 00:29:58.759
And I am not a vegan.

00:29:58.759 --> 00:30:01.300
Question-- you were talking a
little bit about the marketing.

00:30:01.300 --> 00:30:03.850
And I'm curious how you came
up with Fat Witch, the title

00:30:03.850 --> 00:30:05.180
and the logo in general.

00:30:05.180 --> 00:30:07.440
Why a witch?

00:30:07.440 --> 00:30:09.140
PATRICIA HELDING: OK.

00:30:09.140 --> 00:30:09.800
I like witches.

00:30:14.290 --> 00:30:17.684
When I was a trader,
one of my friend traders

00:30:17.684 --> 00:30:19.475
had a laugh just like
a-- she had a cackle.

00:30:19.475 --> 00:30:20.960
It was just like a witch.

00:30:20.960 --> 00:30:24.350
And I would bring brownies
to the trading floor.

00:30:24.350 --> 00:30:26.700
And Pamela would
come over every day.

00:30:26.700 --> 00:30:30.770
And I said, Pamela, seriously,
this is a lot of butter.

00:30:30.770 --> 00:30:34.600
You're going to be a fat witch
if you keep eating these.

00:30:34.600 --> 00:30:37.260
And I just thought
it was a funny name.

00:30:37.260 --> 00:30:39.380
And as I said, I
just drew the logo,

00:30:39.380 --> 00:30:45.360
because we didn't have any
money to hire a graphics person.

00:30:45.360 --> 00:30:46.610
Now I have a graphics person.

00:30:46.610 --> 00:30:50.610
But back then, no.

00:30:50.610 --> 00:30:52.740
And one thing, some
people when we started out

00:30:52.740 --> 00:30:54.610
said, that's a terrible name.

00:30:54.610 --> 00:30:56.760
You should ever use that.

00:30:56.760 --> 00:30:58.650
But nobody forgets it.

00:30:58.650 --> 00:31:00.009
That's the trade off with it.

00:31:00.009 --> 00:31:02.050
JEFF BUCHAN: I guess the
question is, does Pamela

00:31:02.050 --> 00:31:04.844
know that she is the
inspiration for Fat Witch?

00:31:04.844 --> 00:31:05.760
PATRICIA HELDING: Yes.

00:31:05.760 --> 00:31:06.676
JEFF BUCHAN: She does?

00:31:06.676 --> 00:31:08.430
PATRICIA HELDING: She does.

00:31:08.430 --> 00:31:09.674
Good question.

00:31:09.674 --> 00:31:11.090
JEFF BUCHAN: I
think we might have

00:31:11.090 --> 00:31:13.855
time for one or two more
questions if anyone has them.

00:31:13.855 --> 00:31:14.980
PATRICIA HELDING: Go ahead.

00:31:14.980 --> 00:31:15.450
Sure, come on.

00:31:15.450 --> 00:31:16.575
JEFF BUCHAN: Step right up.

00:31:19.040 --> 00:31:21.080
AUDIENCE: You mentioned
you had dreams

00:31:21.080 --> 00:31:24.400
of one day using technology,
and it could be all automated.

00:31:24.400 --> 00:31:27.360
I guess my question is if
that could really happen

00:31:27.360 --> 00:31:31.000
and you took that step, at
what point is it too far?

00:31:31.000 --> 00:31:33.620
Would you go fully
automated if you could?

00:31:33.620 --> 00:31:35.170
Is that still
baking, or does there

00:31:35.170 --> 00:31:38.355
need to be some sort
of human element in it?

00:31:38.355 --> 00:31:39.980
And do you lose
something of your brand

00:31:39.980 --> 00:31:44.230
if it becomes too
automated in the process?

00:31:44.230 --> 00:31:46.700
PATRICIA HELDING: That is
a genius question there.

00:31:46.700 --> 00:31:48.492
AUDIENCE: Thank you.

00:31:48.492 --> 00:31:49.950
JEFF BUCHAN: Third
time is a charm.

00:31:49.950 --> 00:31:51.780
PATRICIA HELDING:
A lot of baking

00:31:51.780 --> 00:31:55.110
is pretty automated
with depositors

00:31:55.110 --> 00:31:58.470
as they go along
a conveyor belt--

00:31:58.470 --> 00:32:01.610
the dropping in so much flour,
dropping in so much stuff.

00:32:01.610 --> 00:32:03.880
You've seen it on the
Food Network and stuff.

00:32:06.940 --> 00:32:10.620
I don't think we're going to
ever be that globally dominate,

00:32:10.620 --> 00:32:12.355
but we would do that.

00:32:15.760 --> 00:32:20.730
What's nice about that is that
there aren't any mistakes.

00:32:20.730 --> 00:32:23.200
But I think you
do lose something.

00:32:23.200 --> 00:32:25.420
I can't pinpoint
what it would be,

00:32:25.420 --> 00:32:28.660
but I think it makes
you less experimental.

00:32:28.660 --> 00:32:30.430
I think a Hostess
cupcake is always going

00:32:30.430 --> 00:32:33.492
to be that Hostess cupcake.

00:32:33.492 --> 00:32:34.450
JEFF BUCHAN: All right.

00:32:34.450 --> 00:32:36.162
Time for one more question.

00:32:36.162 --> 00:32:37.870
AUDIENCE: We're like
the question people.

00:32:37.870 --> 00:32:38.960
PATRICIA HELDING: All right.

00:32:38.960 --> 00:32:39.501
AUDIENCE: OK.

00:32:39.501 --> 00:32:41.897
So we used to be based in
this building, my team,

00:32:41.897 --> 00:32:43.980
and we just recently moved
over to Chelsea Market.

00:32:43.980 --> 00:32:45.563
PATRICIA HELDING:
You used to be what?

00:32:45.563 --> 00:32:47.954
AUDIENCE: We used to be
based in this building.

00:32:47.954 --> 00:32:50.370
So we just moved over about a
month ago to Chelsea Market.

00:32:50.370 --> 00:32:51.680
And it's the bane
of my existence,

00:32:51.680 --> 00:32:53.471
because I'm walking
through bakery corridor

00:32:53.471 --> 00:32:54.750
on my way to work every day.

00:32:54.750 --> 00:32:56.320
So I have a huge sweet tooth.

00:32:56.320 --> 00:32:59.187
My question for you-- if you
weren't eating at Fat Witch,

00:32:59.187 --> 00:33:01.270
you've already had your
fill of Fat Witch-- what's

00:33:01.270 --> 00:33:02.140
your next stop?

00:33:02.140 --> 00:33:05.250
Which is your
favorite other bakery?

00:33:05.250 --> 00:33:07.040
JEFF BUCHAN: Good question.

00:33:07.040 --> 00:33:09.658
AUDIENCE: And what
would you get there?

00:33:09.658 --> 00:33:11.866
PATRICIA HELDING: I would
probably go to Sarahbeth's.

00:33:15.310 --> 00:33:19.100
I think she has
quality pastries.

00:33:19.100 --> 00:33:21.520
I do like-- she's got
an egg salad sandwich,

00:33:21.520 --> 00:33:24.500
and I think she makes the
English muffins or whatever,

00:33:24.500 --> 00:33:27.760
the biscuits she puts it on.

00:33:27.760 --> 00:33:31.060
Buying somebody else's brownies
I only do for experiment.

00:33:31.060 --> 00:33:33.400
[LAUGHTER]

00:33:33.400 --> 00:33:36.600
Cookies maybe.

00:33:36.600 --> 00:33:38.459
But I would probably
go to Sarahbeth's next.

00:33:38.459 --> 00:33:39.000
AUDIENCE: OK.

00:33:39.000 --> 00:33:41.460
So then Ruthy's versus Eleni's,
do you have a preference?

00:33:41.460 --> 00:33:43.376
PATRICIA HELDING: Ruthy's
isn't there anymore.

not there anymore?

A couple weeks ago.

00:33:50.730 --> 00:33:52.938
