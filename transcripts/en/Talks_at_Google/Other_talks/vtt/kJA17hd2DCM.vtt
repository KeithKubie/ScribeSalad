00:00:00.988 --> 00:00:04.940
[APPLAUSE]

00:00:04.940 --> 00:00:06.100
VINT CERF: Hi there.

00:00:06.100 --> 00:00:09.340
First of all, I want to tell you
that Carla LaFever and I have

00:00:09.340 --> 00:00:10.700
known Gary for a long time.

00:00:10.700 --> 00:00:13.890
We are all part of the
MCI community for awhile.

00:00:13.890 --> 00:00:17.009
And Carla really believes
in what Gary's doing.

00:00:17.009 --> 00:00:18.800
And I can prove this,
because this morning,

00:00:18.800 --> 00:00:21.590
she came into with a
giant sack of vegetables

00:00:21.590 --> 00:00:23.000
that she grew in her own garden.

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:27.214
So she's practicing
what Gary preaches.

00:00:27.214 --> 00:00:28.880
Let me tell you a
little bit about Gary.

00:00:28.880 --> 00:00:31.610
I came across Gary
Oppenheimer back

00:00:31.610 --> 00:00:35.690
in the mid 1980s, when
we were both at MCI mail.

00:00:35.690 --> 00:00:38.520
And he noticed that this was
a communication company that

00:00:38.520 --> 00:00:41.130
wasn't communicating
well with its customers.

00:00:41.130 --> 00:00:43.260
So he connected the
dots, by creating

00:00:43.260 --> 00:00:45.670
the first electronic newsletter.

00:00:45.670 --> 00:00:47.880
Well, he's done it again.

00:00:47.880 --> 00:00:50.160
Today, most people
think about hunger.

00:00:50.160 --> 00:00:53.490
But few about food waste,
that is it's cause.

00:00:53.490 --> 00:00:56.260
So we spent a great deal of time
and money to feed the hungry,

00:00:56.260 --> 00:00:59.090
without actually solving hunger.

00:00:59.090 --> 00:01:03.450
Gary identified the problem that
most people never knew existed.

00:01:03.450 --> 00:01:05.830
The food waste, by
tens of millions

00:01:05.830 --> 00:01:08.870
of growers with overly
abundant gardens,

00:01:08.870 --> 00:01:11.750
while their nearby
neighbors went hungry.

00:01:11.750 --> 00:01:17.040
His nonprofit, AmpleHarvest.org,
created a whole new supply

00:01:17.040 --> 00:01:19.710
channel, for the
American food safety net.

00:01:19.710 --> 00:01:22.020
Not by buying and
distributing food,

00:01:22.020 --> 00:01:23.870
as it had usually been done.

00:01:23.870 --> 00:01:26.940
But instead, by connecting
those dots to unleash,

00:01:26.940 --> 00:01:30.840
well, the pent up supply of
freely available, locally

00:01:30.840 --> 00:01:34.250
grown, fresh food, and
community goodwill,

00:01:34.250 --> 00:01:36.610
on a sustainable
and life long basis.

00:01:36.610 --> 00:01:40.110
And believe me, sustainable
was really important there.

00:01:40.110 --> 00:01:43.570
AmpleHarvest.org
leverages its technology,

00:01:43.570 --> 00:01:45.300
and many of the
Google resources,

00:01:45.300 --> 00:01:49.020
to pair growers with
local food pantries.

00:01:49.020 --> 00:01:53.480
It addresses both food waste as
the underlying cause of hunger,

00:01:53.480 --> 00:01:55.760
as well was hunger itself.

00:01:55.760 --> 00:01:59.170
They use the internet to bring
extreme market efficiency

00:01:59.170 --> 00:02:02.580
to what is in the past has been
a very inefficient process.

00:02:02.580 --> 00:02:06.420
It's an inherently scalable and
potentially global solution.

00:02:06.420 --> 00:02:08.630
It makes the best use
of precious resources

00:02:08.630 --> 00:02:10.190
we have today.

00:02:10.190 --> 00:02:12.690
The long term outcome
is an improvement

00:02:12.690 --> 00:02:17.330
in the future of health, and by
extension, wealth of America.

00:02:17.330 --> 00:02:20.020
All at no cost to the grower.

00:02:20.020 --> 00:02:22.840
Many individuals think they
can't make a difference today,

00:02:22.840 --> 00:02:26.270
but this whole process
proves them wrong.

00:02:26.270 --> 00:02:30.010
Gary uses technology to create
the opportunity for others

00:02:30.010 --> 00:02:31.920
to improve the
future of America,

00:02:31.920 --> 00:02:34.530
and by extension, the
rest of the world.

00:02:34.530 --> 00:02:37.280
In this multiplier
effect, the distributed

00:02:37.280 --> 00:02:40.870
disruptive technology can be
hugely impactful and extremely

00:02:40.870 --> 00:02:44.070
efficient in addressing some
of our pressing problems.

00:02:44.070 --> 00:02:48.060
Before I close, here's a little
bit of information about Gary.

00:02:48.060 --> 00:02:53.000
He is a self described
'aging geek;' a CNN hero;

00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:56.290
lecture and speaker,
including a TEDx;

00:02:56.290 --> 00:03:00.680
Points of Light Tribute
winner; Purpose Prize fellow;

00:03:00.680 --> 00:03:03.470
Huffington Post Greatest
Person of the Day;

00:03:03.470 --> 00:03:08.910
and 2011 Game Changer,
winner of the Russell Berrie

00:03:08.910 --> 00:03:11.710
Foundation's Making
a Difference Award;

00:03:11.710 --> 00:03:16.480
winner the Glenwood 2011 Wave
of the Future Award winner

00:03:16.480 --> 00:03:21.550
of the 2012 Elfenworks in
Harmony with Hope award;

00:03:21.550 --> 00:03:25.435
Echoing Green semifinalist; and
someone I recently nominated

00:03:25.435 --> 00:03:27.880
for the World Food prize.

00:03:27.880 --> 00:03:30.510
He now makes his home in the
mountains of northern New

00:03:30.510 --> 00:03:33.090
Jersey, after having
lived on a boat,

00:03:33.090 --> 00:03:37.240
on the Hudson River in
Manhattan, since 1978.

00:03:37.240 --> 00:03:41.670
He's also a master gardener;
Rutgers environmental steward;

00:03:41.670 --> 00:03:43.810
former community
garden director;

00:03:43.810 --> 00:03:46.230
a town environmental
commissioner-- I didn't even

00:03:46.230 --> 00:03:50.030
know they had such things;
a small scale farmer;

00:03:50.030 --> 00:03:53.835
a long distance cyclist; and the
founder and executive director

00:03:53.835 --> 00:03:58.140
of the nonprofit called
AmpleHarvest.org.

00:03:58.140 --> 00:04:01.770
It's not often that a
small tech based charity

00:04:01.770 --> 00:04:05.160
gets the awards and accolades,
including from the White

00:04:05.160 --> 00:04:08.440
House, and the recognition
that they have.

00:04:08.440 --> 00:04:13.580
Google's technology, including
AdWords, Map Engine, Alerts,

00:04:13.580 --> 00:04:17.000
Knowledge Grabs, Street
View, YouTube, and more,

00:04:17.000 --> 00:04:20.480
are all a part of what
makes AmpleHarvest.org

00:04:20.480 --> 00:04:21.730
work brilliantly.

00:04:21.730 --> 00:04:23.950
Google's been a proud
partner in this effort.

00:04:23.950 --> 00:04:26.130
And I hope you too
will find a way

00:04:26.130 --> 00:04:29.530
to help support
AmpleHarvest.org's work.

00:04:29.530 --> 00:04:33.370
And I give you now,
Gary Oppenheimer.

00:04:33.370 --> 00:04:37.887
[APPLAUSE]

00:04:37.887 --> 00:04:39.470
GARY OPPENHEIMER:
Thank you very much.

00:04:39.470 --> 00:04:40.640
Vint, thank you so much.

00:04:40.640 --> 00:04:41.990
I hope you're still seeing this.

00:04:41.990 --> 00:04:46.280
And I appreciate you and Carla
taking the time, and especially

00:04:46.280 --> 00:04:49.370
Vint, thank you for doing
this on your birthday.

00:04:49.370 --> 00:04:51.680
This is Vint's birthday.

00:04:51.680 --> 00:04:53.785
So--

00:04:53.785 --> 00:04:54.660
VINT CERF: Hey, Gary.

00:04:54.660 --> 00:04:55.670
I'm 71.

00:04:55.670 --> 00:04:57.585
That means I'm in my prime.

00:04:57.585 --> 00:04:59.710
GARY OPPENHEIMER: I think
you will be in your prime

00:04:59.710 --> 00:05:01.970
for a very long time.

00:05:01.970 --> 00:05:02.700
But thank you.

00:05:02.700 --> 00:05:04.970
Thank you very, very much.

00:05:04.970 --> 00:05:06.470
And I'm hoping that
for those of you

00:05:06.470 --> 00:05:09.460
choose to do any
tweeting about this talk,

00:05:09.460 --> 00:05:12.610
that you'll send this out to
your network of the people

00:05:12.610 --> 00:05:14.510
that you communicate with.

00:05:14.510 --> 00:05:17.320
We'll going to be talking about
four different topics today.

00:05:17.320 --> 00:05:21.280
Food waste, as Vint had said;
the impact of food waste;

00:05:21.280 --> 00:05:24.960
the solution; and what's
going on in the future.

00:05:24.960 --> 00:05:27.820
We're going to have this
in a three part, today.

00:05:27.820 --> 00:05:30.560
I'm going to talk
for about 15 minutes.

00:05:30.560 --> 00:05:31.060
Then Kim.

00:05:31.060 --> 00:05:33.601
And by the way, Kim, thank you
very much for setting this up.

00:05:33.601 --> 00:05:34.330
I appreciate it.

00:05:34.330 --> 00:05:36.600
But Kim's going to
do a Q&amp;A up here.

00:05:36.600 --> 00:05:39.227
And then, for about half
an hour, give or take,

00:05:39.227 --> 00:05:41.560
I'd like to open this up to
questions from the audience,

00:05:41.560 --> 00:05:42.250
from all of you.

00:05:42.250 --> 00:05:44.990
So please think about things
you want to ask about;

00:05:44.990 --> 00:05:48.877
questions, concerns, ideas-- I
really would like to hear them.

00:05:48.877 --> 00:05:50.460
Everything comes
with a tipping point.

00:05:50.460 --> 00:05:52.560
This was one of my
several tipping points.

00:05:52.560 --> 00:05:54.220
This was a photograph
in "The New York

00:05:54.220 --> 00:05:57.820
Times," 2008 by Bill Marsh.

00:05:57.820 --> 00:06:00.240
This represents
the amount of food

00:06:00.240 --> 00:06:03.080
lost in America by a
family of four, in a month.

00:06:03.080 --> 00:06:04.820
About a pound a person, a day.

00:06:04.820 --> 00:06:08.110
At that time, it was about
100 billion pounds a year.

00:06:08.110 --> 00:06:10.650
This is something that
everybody owns, from the farmer

00:06:10.650 --> 00:06:12.170
to the consumer.

00:06:12.170 --> 00:06:16.780
So this was what sort
of caught my eye.

00:06:16.780 --> 00:06:19.500
More recently on discussions
about food waste,

00:06:19.500 --> 00:06:21.130
the USDA issued this report.

00:06:21.130 --> 00:06:23.750
This is only about a
month old actually.

00:06:23.750 --> 00:06:27.350
And their look back
report, going back to 2010,

00:06:27.350 --> 00:06:29.560
is just plain frightening.

00:06:29.560 --> 00:06:35.600
In 2010, America lost $161
billion worth of food,

00:06:35.600 --> 00:06:36.210
in one year.

00:06:36.210 --> 00:06:40.240
We talk about our budget,
how it affects the economy.

00:06:40.240 --> 00:06:42.804
Imagine if somebody had
to write a check for $161

00:06:42.804 --> 00:06:43.470
billion dollars.

00:06:43.470 --> 00:06:46.810
We flush that away
in food waste.

00:06:46.810 --> 00:06:49.360
A third of our food
didn't get consumed.

00:06:49.360 --> 00:06:51.120
And that's a significant
chunk of what

00:06:51.120 --> 00:06:54.680
we could have been giving people
across America as the nutrition

00:06:54.680 --> 00:06:56.780
that they need.

00:06:56.780 --> 00:07:00.070
In 2012, the National
Resource Defense Counsel

00:07:00.070 --> 00:07:01.070
issued this report.

00:07:01.070 --> 00:07:04.880
Now although the report
came before the USDA report,

00:07:04.880 --> 00:07:06.180
it's actually using later data.

00:07:06.180 --> 00:07:08.200
So the two of them
swap a little bit.

00:07:08.200 --> 00:07:10.750
Their computations
were 40% of the food

00:07:10.750 --> 00:07:12.940
in this country is not consumed.

00:07:12.940 --> 00:07:16.940
4% of the energy American
reduces got lost.

00:07:16.940 --> 00:07:20.610
32% of the water
we have was wasted.

00:07:20.610 --> 00:07:23.080
Because water is a
huge part of our-- use

00:07:23.080 --> 00:07:24.620
of water for agriculture.

00:07:24.620 --> 00:07:27.810
And it represented about
20 pounds a person, of food

00:07:27.810 --> 00:07:29.100
a month.

00:07:29.100 --> 00:07:33.680
So this is hurting everybody
across the country.

00:07:33.680 --> 00:07:35.190
This is from that NRDC report.

00:07:35.190 --> 00:07:37.900
I'd like you to focus for
a minute on the large red

00:07:37.900 --> 00:07:39.560
and green pies on there.

00:07:39.560 --> 00:07:43.210
That's fruit and vegetables,
in billions of pounds.

00:07:43.210 --> 00:07:47.320
So looking at about 18 and
1/2 billion pounds of fruit,

00:07:47.320 --> 00:07:50.110
about 25 billion pounds of
vegetables that didn't get

00:07:50.110 --> 00:07:50.610
consumed.

00:07:53.790 --> 00:07:56.130
We all own this problem.

00:07:56.130 --> 00:07:57.760
As I said, it
starts at the farm,

00:07:57.760 --> 00:07:59.290
and it ends at
the kitchen table.

00:07:59.290 --> 00:08:02.950
Everybody has a piece
of this problem.

00:08:02.950 --> 00:08:06.530
What was not in any of
these reports however,

00:08:06.530 --> 00:08:08.470
were the people like
myself, and maybe

00:08:08.470 --> 00:08:11.820
like you, who are home
and community gardeners.

00:08:11.820 --> 00:08:14.570
No one's ever really looked at
that information in any detail,

00:08:14.570 --> 00:08:17.000
about the food that
we have, and the food

00:08:17.000 --> 00:08:18.930
that we're not actually using.

00:08:18.930 --> 00:08:20.850
The National
Gardening Association

00:08:20.850 --> 00:08:23.660
issued a report very recently.

00:08:23.660 --> 00:08:27.790
And we're now up to 42 million
people in this country growing

00:08:27.790 --> 00:08:29.267
food in home and
community gardens.

00:08:29.267 --> 00:08:31.850
That's about a little more than
a third of all the households.

00:08:31.850 --> 00:08:34.580
To 17% in the past five years.

00:08:34.580 --> 00:08:36.929
And most interestingly,
the average gardener

00:08:36.929 --> 00:08:39.630
harvests about 300
pounds of food a year.

00:08:39.630 --> 00:08:42.020
Now it's not 300 pounds
over the course of a year,

00:08:42.020 --> 00:08:44.169
because we don't grow
over the course of a year.

00:08:44.169 --> 00:08:46.080
That's compressed into
your growing season.

00:08:46.080 --> 00:08:47.860
So you're waiting for
maybe nine months.

00:08:47.860 --> 00:08:49.040
And then in three
months, you're dealing

00:08:49.040 --> 00:08:50.716
with a staggering
amount of food,

00:08:50.716 --> 00:08:52.840
which is typically more
than you can use, preserve,

00:08:52.840 --> 00:08:54.310
or you can share with friends.

00:08:54.310 --> 00:08:56.070
This is not just in the suburbs.

00:08:56.070 --> 00:08:58.070
An increasing amount of
people in urban settings

00:08:58.070 --> 00:08:59.220
are growing food.

00:08:59.220 --> 00:09:01.444
And even in the younger
generation, Millennials,

00:09:01.444 --> 00:09:02.860
it's a huge increase
in the number

00:09:02.860 --> 00:09:05.040
of people who are growing
food for themselves.

00:09:05.040 --> 00:09:06.910
The food waste on
the grower side

00:09:06.910 --> 00:09:10.379
comes from enthusiasm,
over planting,

00:09:10.379 --> 00:09:11.920
not being able to
share with friends,

00:09:11.920 --> 00:09:13.940
I've discovered personally--
there's only so many cucumbers

00:09:13.940 --> 00:09:16.106
you can give to friends and
still have them call you

00:09:16.106 --> 00:09:16.980
a friend.

00:09:16.980 --> 00:09:19.030
Choosing not to preserve in can.

00:09:19.030 --> 00:09:20.660
And just getting
bored and overwhelmed,

00:09:20.660 --> 00:09:23.370
come August and September, the
tomatoes are still producing,

00:09:23.370 --> 00:09:24.500
and you're fed up.

00:09:24.500 --> 00:09:29.310
The stuff is left to rot,
or goes into the garbage.

00:09:29.310 --> 00:09:31.360
So what's the impact
of this food waste?

00:09:34.280 --> 00:09:35.520
This is not a political map.

00:09:35.520 --> 00:09:36.780
Let me start with this.

00:09:36.780 --> 00:09:38.690
Those red states,
these 23 states,

00:09:38.690 --> 00:09:40.980
if you add the combined
population of the states,

00:09:40.980 --> 00:09:42.770
you're looking at
the number of people

00:09:42.770 --> 00:09:44.770
in this country who
are food insecure.

00:09:44.770 --> 00:09:46.610
Food insecurity, by
the way, means either

00:09:46.610 --> 00:09:49.780
that you're hungry, or you're
at real risk of being hungry.

00:09:49.780 --> 00:09:54.370
So one out of every six Americas
are considered food insecure.

00:09:54.370 --> 00:09:56.590
That's about 50 million people.

00:09:56.590 --> 00:09:59.825
One out of every four
children in this country

00:09:59.825 --> 00:10:01.450
are growing up in a
food insecure home.

00:10:01.450 --> 00:10:02.824
And in some
populations, it's one

00:10:02.824 --> 00:10:06.440
out of every three children.

00:10:06.440 --> 00:10:09.760
These kids who don't eat
well, don't do well in school.

00:10:09.760 --> 00:10:11.580
Their parents, who
don't eat well,

00:10:11.580 --> 00:10:13.580
don't do well in the workplace.

00:10:13.580 --> 00:10:17.450
So the country is hurting,
today's economy and tomorrow's

00:10:17.450 --> 00:10:19.650
economy, by not
nourishing the people

00:10:19.650 --> 00:10:22.160
that need the food the most.

00:10:22.160 --> 00:10:24.790
The impact from the health
perspective is staggering.

00:10:24.790 --> 00:10:27.850
People are arguing about
the Affordable Health Care

00:10:27.850 --> 00:10:29.270
Act, Obamacare.

00:10:29.270 --> 00:10:31.640
Really what's
coming down the pike

00:10:31.640 --> 00:10:35.460
are staggering numbers on
obesity, type 2 diabetes,

00:10:35.460 --> 00:10:37.940
hypertension, and other
food related illnesses.

00:10:37.940 --> 00:10:40.730
Things that we could
prevent and actually fix,

00:10:40.730 --> 00:10:42.414
are trending to the worst.

00:10:42.414 --> 00:10:43.830
In part because
of the food that's

00:10:43.830 --> 00:10:46.840
available to too many people.

00:10:46.840 --> 00:10:50.910
I had a brief chat with General
Clark in October, retired.

00:10:50.910 --> 00:10:52.620
Three out of four
young people who

00:10:52.620 --> 00:10:54.040
apply to the
military service are

00:10:54.040 --> 00:10:57.820
rejected, because
they're not fit to serve.

00:10:57.820 --> 00:10:59.670
How does the food
system work today?

00:10:59.670 --> 00:11:01.590
The food safety net,
the food bank system.

00:11:01.590 --> 00:11:04.256
If you look at the chart, let me
see if the pointers is working.

00:11:04.256 --> 00:11:05.440
It does, all right.

00:11:05.440 --> 00:11:08.460
The red dot in the middle
is feeding America.

00:11:08.460 --> 00:11:11.020
That is an organization
that represents

00:11:11.020 --> 00:11:14.720
and sort of coordinates 203
food banks across America.

00:11:14.720 --> 00:11:17.440
Food banks being large
warehouse type operations,

00:11:17.440 --> 00:11:19.760
that collect and
redistribute food.

00:11:19.760 --> 00:11:23.590
They connect to 33,500 food
pantries, soup Kitchens,

00:11:23.590 --> 00:11:25.620
and other similar, food
distribution agencies

00:11:25.620 --> 00:11:27.210
across the country.

00:11:27.210 --> 00:11:30.340
That system works very
nicely for processed food.

00:11:30.340 --> 00:11:32.200
You want to have
bread, corn flakes,

00:11:32.200 --> 00:11:35.900
things-- works
very, very nicely.

00:11:35.900 --> 00:11:38.780
One of the problems, is
however, the distribution cycle.

00:11:38.780 --> 00:11:41.550
If you look at that red line
on the bottom marked time,

00:11:41.550 --> 00:11:43.950
it can take days
or weeks for food

00:11:43.950 --> 00:11:48.130
to move from that food
bank to a food pantry.

00:11:48.130 --> 00:11:50.320
The result is, that while
processed canned jars,

00:11:50.320 --> 00:11:53.120
boxes work fine, fresh
food doesn't work,.

00:11:53.120 --> 00:11:56.630
Which is why, when you go to a
food drive, you're always told,

00:11:56.630 --> 00:12:00.160
jars, cans, boxes--
no fresh food.

00:12:00.160 --> 00:12:02.970
The result is that 42
million people like myself,

00:12:02.970 --> 00:12:04.530
who grow food in
home gardens often

00:12:04.530 --> 00:12:06.340
end up just tossing it away.

00:12:06.340 --> 00:12:07.590
If it's more than you can use.

00:12:07.590 --> 00:12:10.710
You either compost it, or
worse, it goes into a landfill,

00:12:10.710 --> 00:12:14.080
and creates
environmental problems.

00:12:14.080 --> 00:12:17.440
In March 2009, I had an idea.

00:12:17.440 --> 00:12:21.770
The idea was, what if we
could enable these people have

00:12:21.770 --> 00:12:24.360
too much food in
their home gardens--

00:12:24.360 --> 00:12:27.281
myself included, by the way--
to be able to donate food

00:12:27.281 --> 00:12:29.280
to the people in the
community who most need it.

00:12:29.280 --> 00:12:31.430
This came out of a discussion
I had in the community garden

00:12:31.430 --> 00:12:32.013
I was running.

00:12:32.013 --> 00:12:33.430
I said to these
people, if you're

00:12:33.430 --> 00:12:35.120
going to have an ample
harvest, the least we could do

00:12:35.120 --> 00:12:36.203
is give it away to people.

00:12:36.203 --> 00:12:37.740
It just rolled off my tongue.

00:12:37.740 --> 00:12:39.350
That was another tipping point.

00:12:39.350 --> 00:12:40.975
Because I found an
AmpleHarvest.org was

00:12:40.975 --> 00:12:43.740
an available domain,
so I grabbed it.

00:12:43.740 --> 00:12:45.380
I had spent the
$9 on that, and I

00:12:45.380 --> 00:12:46.630
couldn't let that go to waste.

00:12:46.630 --> 00:12:47.830
So that brought me to here.

00:12:50.410 --> 00:12:53.850
The idea was to enable
the food to be donated,

00:12:53.850 --> 00:12:57.560
and nobody had ever really done
that before, on a large scale.

00:12:57.560 --> 00:12:59.460
But the vision I
had, the idea was,

00:12:59.460 --> 00:13:01.414
let's bypass the
choke point, and let's

00:13:01.414 --> 00:13:02.830
get that food
directly to the food

00:13:02.830 --> 00:13:05.310
pantries in the communities.

00:13:05.310 --> 00:13:07.571
Because the food-- you can
live in northern Vermont,

00:13:07.571 --> 00:13:09.820
and be a three hour drive
from the regional food bank.

00:13:09.820 --> 00:13:11.800
Or you could go down the
street or across town,

00:13:11.800 --> 00:13:13.770
to the nearby food pantry.

00:13:13.770 --> 00:13:16.710
So that's how AmpleHarvest.org
was actually born.

00:13:16.710 --> 00:13:21.130
The idea was to both be a in the
cloud registry of food pantries

00:13:21.130 --> 00:13:23.089
across America-- an opt-in
registry by the way.

00:13:23.089 --> 00:13:24.546
This is something
where each pantry

00:13:24.546 --> 00:13:25.970
says we want to
be a part of this.

00:13:25.970 --> 00:13:27.815
And a search engine.

00:13:27.815 --> 00:13:29.567
And by the way, Google
was an inspiration

00:13:29.567 --> 00:13:31.900
from that perspective in my
mind, for how to build this.

00:13:31.900 --> 00:13:34.010
A search engine to
actually find the food

00:13:34.010 --> 00:13:35.480
pantries in your neighborhood.

00:13:35.480 --> 00:13:38.540
And then for you to actually
take the food directly

00:13:38.540 --> 00:13:39.830
to the food pantry yourself.

00:13:39.830 --> 00:13:40.750
Were not involved.

00:13:40.750 --> 00:13:42.420
So we have zero logistics.

00:13:42.420 --> 00:13:44.690
The hope and the intent was
to create a system whereby

00:13:44.690 --> 00:13:47.210
once you knew you could and
should donate the food--

00:13:47.210 --> 00:13:49.479
and we enabled it--
you would do so

00:13:49.479 --> 00:13:50.770
for the rest of gardening life.

00:13:50.770 --> 00:13:52.300
And on top of that, you
would tell your friends

00:13:52.300 --> 00:13:54.925
who are complaining that they've
grown too much food, that they

00:13:54.925 --> 00:13:59.280
had the opportunity
to donate the food.

00:13:59.280 --> 00:14:01.870
This is what AmpleHarvest.org
looks like today.

00:14:01.870 --> 00:14:03.575
It's looks very
familiar for those

00:14:03.575 --> 00:14:04.950
of you familiar
with Google Maps.

00:14:04.950 --> 00:14:06.350
It's basically a search engine.

00:14:06.350 --> 00:14:07.641
There's a database of pantries.

00:14:07.641 --> 00:14:09.380
You pick the pantry
that you want.

00:14:09.380 --> 00:14:11.150
You find the pantry,
and now you've

00:14:11.150 --> 00:14:13.660
got a direct connection
with that food pantry.

00:14:13.660 --> 00:14:16.030
One of the pantries did
something I hadn't expected.

00:14:16.030 --> 00:14:17.500
It was His Hands Food Pantry.

00:14:17.500 --> 00:14:19.120
This particular
pantry registered

00:14:19.120 --> 00:14:22.034
and they did something in their
listing I haven't expected.

00:14:22.034 --> 00:14:23.950
They talk back to the
community and said, hey,

00:14:23.950 --> 00:14:26.330
we need stuff from you.

00:14:26.330 --> 00:14:27.790
It was the first
time I saw that.

00:14:27.790 --> 00:14:29.270
And it dawned on me,
my god, these pantries

00:14:29.270 --> 00:14:30.710
are talking back
to the community.

00:14:30.710 --> 00:14:33.704
They're telling the community
what they really need.

00:14:33.704 --> 00:14:35.495
That created a whole
new market efficiency,

00:14:35.495 --> 00:14:37.825
and we're building the new
AmpleHarvest.org you'll

00:14:37.825 --> 00:14:39.950
be learning about in a few
minutes, around the idea

00:14:39.950 --> 00:14:41.366
that not only can
you donate food,

00:14:41.366 --> 00:14:43.580
but the pantries can
actually help guide you

00:14:43.580 --> 00:14:45.580
to what they most
importantly need.

00:14:45.580 --> 00:14:48.820
So the innovations are all over
the place, as it turned out.

00:14:48.820 --> 00:14:51.029
I built this and then I
looked back and said, my god,

00:14:51.029 --> 00:14:52.820
look at all these things
that are in there.

00:14:52.820 --> 00:14:54.030
The food system gets improve.

00:14:54.030 --> 00:14:55.310
Behavior gets changed.

00:14:55.310 --> 00:14:57.810
The environment is
impacted, and the impact

00:14:57.810 --> 00:14:59.460
on society as a
whole, has changed.

00:14:59.460 --> 00:15:03.010
But basically, it's a very
empowering resource for anybody

00:15:03.010 --> 00:15:05.190
to be able to go,
and to say, I can

00:15:05.190 --> 00:15:07.650
be the game changer
for my own community.

00:15:07.650 --> 00:15:10.020
For the first time, food
pantries across America,

00:15:10.020 --> 00:15:12.417
that almost never
have fresh food,

00:15:12.417 --> 00:15:14.000
suddenly began to
have the opportunity

00:15:14.000 --> 00:15:16.140
to offer fresh
food to the people

00:15:16.140 --> 00:15:17.770
in their own communities.

00:15:17.770 --> 00:15:21.410
This is in Bridgeport,
Connecticut.

00:15:21.410 --> 00:15:23.160
It's an urban city.

00:15:23.160 --> 00:15:26.950
Somebody donated food that
would have been thrown away,

00:15:26.950 --> 00:15:28.230
to a food pantry.

00:15:28.230 --> 00:15:30.000
Just imagine what
that type of change

00:15:30.000 --> 00:15:32.041
that happens, whether
you're in Bridgeport or New

00:15:32.041 --> 00:15:34.790
York, or near the city or
suburb, or rural setting.

00:15:34.790 --> 00:15:37.310
It works all over.

00:15:37.310 --> 00:15:41.200
So AmpleHarvest.org, I had
this idea in March of 2009,

00:15:41.200 --> 00:15:46.499
and it took me seven weeks from
that idea date to get it built.

00:15:46.499 --> 00:15:47.540
And to get it rolled out.

00:15:47.540 --> 00:15:49.873
And by the way, at the time
it was done by three people.

00:15:49.873 --> 00:15:53.510
A woman who donated her time
in town for the front end

00:15:53.510 --> 00:15:55.500
of the pretty part,
where it looks good.

00:15:55.500 --> 00:15:58.950
A gentleman who put together his
time for building the database.

00:15:58.950 --> 00:16:00.240
And I did the contents.

00:16:00.240 --> 00:16:02.280
So basically, if it's
pretty, Maureen did it.

00:16:02.280 --> 00:16:03.630
If it's data, Josh did it.

00:16:03.630 --> 00:16:05.330
And if you can
read it, I did it.

00:16:05.330 --> 00:16:07.770
Once it was put together
and we were at this point,

00:16:07.770 --> 00:16:09.670
the first pantry signed up.

00:16:09.670 --> 00:16:12.260
I started making heavy
use if Google Alerts,

00:16:12.260 --> 00:16:15.000
to start telling me about other
pantries and other connections,

00:16:15.000 --> 00:16:17.630
to start spreading the word.

00:16:17.630 --> 00:16:20.630
This was 100
pantries on June 20.

00:16:20.630 --> 00:16:24.400
Now what's interesting is that
I had gone to Google and said,

00:16:24.400 --> 00:16:26.450
do you guys have anything
you can help us with?

00:16:26.450 --> 00:16:28.140
I got this really cool idea.

00:16:28.140 --> 00:16:30.180
And the answer was yes.

00:16:30.180 --> 00:16:31.900
Google has an AdWords
grant program.

00:16:31.900 --> 00:16:32.530
We applied.

00:16:32.530 --> 00:16:35.000
We got fast tracked through
that system really fast,

00:16:35.000 --> 00:16:37.320
and whoever I owe
thanks to, thank you.

00:16:37.320 --> 00:16:40.400
And so in the time between
launch and this date,

00:16:40.400 --> 00:16:43.410
AmpleHarvest.org was
already up on AdWords.

00:16:43.410 --> 00:16:45.750
And I have to say, I knew
nothing about AdWords myself.

00:16:45.750 --> 00:16:47.490
It was a quick learn
I had to go through.

00:16:47.490 --> 00:16:48.948
And at this point,
AmpleHarvest.org

00:16:48.948 --> 00:16:52.680
was now a one person
operation, largely me.

00:16:52.680 --> 00:16:54.740
This is 500 pantries in August.

00:16:54.740 --> 00:16:57.300
We had 1,000 pantries
in October, 2015,

00:16:57.300 --> 00:16:59.440
which just happened
to be World Food Day.

00:16:59.440 --> 00:17:06.780
2,000 pantries, and today, we're
at nearly 7,000 food pantries.

00:17:06.780 --> 00:17:09.030
One out of every
five in America.

00:17:09.030 --> 00:17:12.349
This means that people who
live in these communities,

00:17:12.349 --> 00:17:14.900
for the first time ever,
are able to donate food

00:17:14.900 --> 00:17:18.520
to a food pantry in
their own community.

00:17:18.520 --> 00:17:22.619
Media coverage went off
the roof, it was wonderful.

00:17:22.619 --> 00:17:25.180
Instead of food going
into a waste stream,

00:17:25.180 --> 00:17:28.079
people were donating
food from home gardens

00:17:28.079 --> 00:17:29.970
Small farmers were
donating food,

00:17:29.970 --> 00:17:31.794
and it was getting
into the pantry system.

00:17:31.794 --> 00:17:33.210
And by the way,
just so everybody,

00:17:33.210 --> 00:17:34.980
knows the feedback
from the pantries

00:17:34.980 --> 00:17:37.490
has been that when the
fresh food shows up,

00:17:37.490 --> 00:17:39.542
it's the first thing
the clients go for.

00:17:39.542 --> 00:17:41.000
I mean there's been
this idea that,

00:17:41.000 --> 00:17:42.490
do people really
want fresh food?

00:17:42.490 --> 00:17:43.490
They do.

00:17:43.490 --> 00:17:46.140
And it's the first
that they go for.

00:17:46.140 --> 00:17:49.780
So for the future,
you're looking

00:17:49.780 --> 00:17:51.270
at the new AmpleHarvest.org.

00:17:51.270 --> 00:17:54.060
We're announcing it
right here, right now.

00:17:54.060 --> 00:17:56.950
AmpleHarvest.org as a
website and as a system

00:17:56.950 --> 00:17:57.990
is being rebuilt.

00:17:57.990 --> 00:17:59.020
This is our new look.

00:17:59.020 --> 00:18:00.460
This is our new logo.

00:18:00.460 --> 00:18:02.800
So I hope you like it.

00:18:02.800 --> 00:18:04.560
This is what the
new AmpleHarvest.org

00:18:04.560 --> 00:18:06.350
page is going to look like.

00:18:06.350 --> 00:18:08.704
It's built around Google
technologies, a whole lot

00:18:08.704 --> 00:18:10.120
of which I don't
know a lot about.

00:18:10.120 --> 00:18:12.120
But I've got an amazing
tech team working on it,

00:18:12.120 --> 00:18:13.800
with help from Google
engineers, which

00:18:13.800 --> 00:18:15.270
they've just been wonderful.

00:18:15.270 --> 00:18:17.010
So this is what the
new AmpleHarvest.org

00:18:17.010 --> 00:18:19.051
heart of our website is
going to be looking like.

00:18:19.051 --> 00:18:22.400
It's going to be out
in a month or so.

00:18:22.400 --> 00:18:26.260
The programs that we have in
place for AmpleHarvest.org;

00:18:26.260 --> 00:18:28.150
it's going to be using
time management push

00:18:28.150 --> 00:18:30.130
technology, a whole bunch
of new Google things.

00:18:30.130 --> 00:18:32.790
We're going to in the future be
building GleaningHarvest.org,

00:18:32.790 --> 00:18:35.390
which will be
AmpleHarvest.org on steroids.

00:18:35.390 --> 00:18:36.870
It's going to be
a resource that's

00:18:36.870 --> 00:18:38.660
not going to work with
the home gardener,

00:18:38.660 --> 00:18:43.020
but with an even larger
amount of food left behind

00:18:43.020 --> 00:18:46.450
on farms across
America, farmers harvest

00:18:46.450 --> 00:18:48.430
their stuff and a
few things happen.

00:18:48.430 --> 00:18:51.080
One of which is the machinery
leaves a lot in the ground.

00:18:51.080 --> 00:18:53.170
Another is the prices
drop, and the farmer says,

00:18:53.170 --> 00:18:54.884
I'm not even gonna
bother harvesting it.

00:18:54.884 --> 00:18:57.050
There are many different
things-- carrots, too long,

00:18:57.050 --> 00:18:57.850
too short.

00:18:57.850 --> 00:19:00.610
Cosmetically, not perfect.

00:19:00.610 --> 00:19:03.180
Leaning organizations are
going to be getting a spotlight

00:19:03.180 --> 00:19:04.530
from gleaningharvest.org.

00:19:04.530 --> 00:19:05.620
We're going to be
building this whole thing

00:19:05.620 --> 00:19:06.770
on Google technology.

00:19:06.770 --> 00:19:09.670
And for the first time, we'll
be able to connect gleaning

00:19:09.670 --> 00:19:12.280
organizations to the
farms, just like we now

00:19:12.280 --> 00:19:15.720
connect home gardeners
to the pantries.

00:19:15.720 --> 00:19:18.950
And we'll go further into
ending this scourge, really,

00:19:18.950 --> 00:19:23.429
of wasted food in the country.

00:19:23.429 --> 00:19:24.970
Let me see if I can
get this working.

00:19:24.970 --> 00:19:28.600
Because this is something
that was-- well,

00:19:28.600 --> 00:19:30.600
this is the level of
support that we've gotten--

00:19:30.600 --> 00:19:31.266
[VIDEO PLAYBACK]

00:19:31.266 --> 00:19:34.480
-The response to this initiative
has been overwhelming.

00:19:34.480 --> 00:19:37.070
All kinds of faith communities
have been stepping up.

00:19:37.070 --> 00:19:40.530
Muslim community leaders are
hosting sports tournaments,

00:19:40.530 --> 00:19:43.290
to encourage young
people to get active.

00:19:43.290 --> 00:19:45.680
The Jewish Community
Centers Association

00:19:45.680 --> 00:19:49.650
is working with JCCs around
the country to grow gardens,

00:19:49.650 --> 00:19:52.670
and to get fresh food
in under served areas.

00:19:52.670 --> 00:19:56.540
And they're creating early
child wellness programs.

00:19:56.540 --> 00:19:58.910
Groups like the National
Council of Churches

00:19:58.910 --> 00:20:02.860
have joined with an organization
called AmpleHarvest,

00:20:02.860 --> 00:20:07.270
to help gardeners donate
fresh produce to 4,700

00:20:07.270 --> 00:20:08.960
of their local food pantries.

00:20:08.960 --> 00:20:09.910
[END VIDEO PLAYBACK]

00:20:09.910 --> 00:20:11.285
GARY OPPENHEIMER:
This was a year

00:20:11.285 --> 00:20:13.080
or two-- this was
about two years ago.

00:20:13.080 --> 00:20:15.280
And Firstlady Stafford
contact me and said,

00:20:15.280 --> 00:20:17.850
you may want to
watch the speech.

00:20:17.850 --> 00:20:20.670
My wife didn't know
why I was screaming.

00:20:20.670 --> 00:20:21.960
But thanks to the White House.

00:20:21.960 --> 00:20:23.750
We've had wonderful support
from the White House,

00:20:23.750 --> 00:20:26.250
both the president's office
and the first lady's office.

00:20:26.250 --> 00:20:28.440
As of last week,
AmpleHarvest.org

00:20:28.440 --> 00:20:30.530
is now included in Feds
Feed Families, which

00:20:30.530 --> 00:20:33.420
is the US government's
own food drive.

00:20:33.420 --> 00:20:35.610
Given the size of the US
government, the largest

00:20:35.610 --> 00:20:37.860
employer in America.

00:20:37.860 --> 00:20:41.360
This means that about one
million home gardeners,

00:20:41.360 --> 00:20:44.012
if government employees
represent the average American,

00:20:44.012 --> 00:20:45.595
will be learning
about the opportunity

00:20:45.595 --> 00:20:47.350
that they can donate food.

00:20:47.350 --> 00:20:49.655
So this is a huge jump
for reducing food waste

00:20:49.655 --> 00:20:52.810
and improving the
nutrition in the country.

00:20:52.810 --> 00:20:54.700
Next month,
AmpleHarvest.org is going

00:20:54.700 --> 00:20:56.800
to be included in the
Google Economic Impact

00:20:56.800 --> 00:20:59.830
report, which is a
huge honor for us.

00:20:59.830 --> 00:21:02.240
And we're again going to
be doing Skip The Flowers.

00:21:02.240 --> 00:21:03.782
And when you are
looking to do events

00:21:03.782 --> 00:21:05.823
where you're going to have
flowers-- whether it's

00:21:05.823 --> 00:21:08.180
a holiday table or an
event, consider the idea

00:21:08.180 --> 00:21:10.704
of actually using
arrangements of whole fruits

00:21:10.704 --> 00:21:12.120
and vegetables
instead of flowers.

00:21:12.120 --> 00:21:16.830
And just donate that food the
next day to a food pantry.

00:21:16.830 --> 00:21:20.300
So what is made
AmpleHarvest.org so special?

00:21:20.300 --> 00:21:21.620
It's simple.

00:21:21.620 --> 00:21:23.880
It's a no-brainer.

00:21:23.880 --> 00:21:24.780
It's very efficient.

00:21:24.780 --> 00:21:25.890
We have no logistics.

00:21:25.890 --> 00:21:28.110
Everything is local
in the community.

00:21:28.110 --> 00:21:28.910
It universal.

00:21:28.910 --> 00:21:31.620
It works every place, and
the resources you need

00:21:31.620 --> 00:21:32.730
are every place.

00:21:32.730 --> 00:21:35.990
And most important, it fixes
some really critical problems

00:21:35.990 --> 00:21:37.827
in our country.

00:21:37.827 --> 00:21:39.660
There are some other
really important things

00:21:39.660 --> 00:21:42.050
about what makes
AmpleHarvest.org so important--

00:21:42.050 --> 00:21:42.706
so good.

00:21:42.706 --> 00:21:44.080
One of the key
things-- I'm gonna

00:21:44.080 --> 00:21:45.496
go into that more
in a moment-- is

00:21:45.496 --> 00:21:48.550
that it is so efficient
from a cost perspective.

00:21:48.550 --> 00:21:51.290
It cost so little, compared
to any other program.

00:21:51.290 --> 00:21:54.740
These have been our partners
that AmpleHarvest.org

00:21:54.740 --> 00:21:56.630
has relied-- has benefited from.

00:21:56.630 --> 00:21:58.500
Google of course, being
an immense partner.

00:21:58.500 --> 00:22:01.280
We're now a Google--
the largest grant

00:22:01.280 --> 00:22:03.710
Google has, in terms of
AdWords, $40,000 a month,

00:22:03.710 --> 00:22:05.170
so thank you all.

00:22:05.170 --> 00:22:09.160
BV, which is a wine
company out west,

00:22:09.160 --> 00:22:12.370
has been our biggest
supporter, in terms of income.

00:22:12.370 --> 00:22:15.690
There really big on pushing and
encouraging innovative ideas

00:22:15.690 --> 00:22:17.060
to deal with hunger.

00:22:17.060 --> 00:22:18.851
And as a matter of
fact, when this is over,

00:22:18.851 --> 00:22:21.250
you're going to enjoy the
fruits of their labor,

00:22:21.250 --> 00:22:24.420
in the back of the room.

00:22:24.420 --> 00:22:28.080
So now we go to this other piece
of this no good deed done goes

00:22:28.080 --> 00:22:29.360
unpunished sort of idea.

00:22:29.360 --> 00:22:30.860
And that is that,
I've discovered

00:22:30.860 --> 00:22:33.780
that in the nonprofit world,
great ideas don't receive quite

00:22:33.780 --> 00:22:36.210
the reception they receive
in the for-profit world.

00:22:36.210 --> 00:22:38.380
So what we've discovered--
it's been interesting,

00:22:38.380 --> 00:22:41.130
is that when you
have a new idea,

00:22:41.130 --> 00:22:42.600
people look it the old way.

00:22:42.600 --> 00:22:45.810
The typical food bank model
is, how many pounds of food?

00:22:45.810 --> 00:22:47.920
How many meals did you serve?

00:22:47.920 --> 00:22:49.880
That really doesn't work here.

00:22:49.880 --> 00:22:52.590
And as a matter of
fact, here, this

00:22:52.590 --> 00:22:55.060
is the questions that we
realize become really important.

00:22:55.060 --> 00:22:56.420
And I did a thought
experiment, by the way,

00:22:56.420 --> 00:22:57.420
that brought me to this.

00:22:57.420 --> 00:22:59.790
Because I originally thought
this was a hunger program.

00:22:59.790 --> 00:23:02.277
It was, the obvious thing to
me was, we're feeding people.

00:23:02.277 --> 00:23:04.110
So I have this very
quick thought experiment

00:23:04.110 --> 00:23:06.510
I want to do with all
of you for a minute.

00:23:06.510 --> 00:23:08.365
Imagine every food
pantry in America--

00:23:08.365 --> 00:23:12.430
all 33,500 are on
AmpleHarvest.org.

00:23:12.430 --> 00:23:16.130
And imagine every grower
in America-- all 42 million

00:23:16.130 --> 00:23:19.690
knew about their
opportunity to donate food.

00:23:19.690 --> 00:23:23.950
And imagine if there was
a drought or a blight,

00:23:23.950 --> 00:23:26.540
and every garden
in America died,

00:23:26.540 --> 00:23:30.870
nothing was harvested that
year, are we a success,

00:23:30.870 --> 00:23:33.470
is AmpleHarvest.org a
success or a failure?

00:23:33.470 --> 00:23:36.095
So a show of hands, how many say
AmpleHarvest.org is a success?

00:23:39.390 --> 00:23:41.790
How many say failure?

00:23:41.790 --> 00:23:44.040
All right, you had the
same idea that I had.

00:23:44.040 --> 00:23:46.230
The fact that the
food wasn't, couldn't

00:23:46.230 --> 00:23:48.090
be moved, had nothing
to do with us.

00:23:48.090 --> 00:23:51.040
We had set up the conduit
for the food to move.

00:23:51.040 --> 00:23:52.790
And that's where I
came to the realization

00:23:52.790 --> 00:23:54.206
that the heart of
AmpleHarvest.org

00:23:54.206 --> 00:23:57.070
is not so much feeding people,
but getting people fed.

00:23:57.070 --> 00:23:59.760
It's a supply side channel
for the food bank system.

00:23:59.760 --> 00:24:01.445
Once I got to that
realization-- this

00:24:01.445 --> 00:24:03.570
has been part of this
problem of being in the weeds

00:24:03.570 --> 00:24:04.920
and not being in the
forest, I started

00:24:04.920 --> 00:24:06.503
to understand the
really bigger impact

00:24:06.503 --> 00:24:07.930
of what this program
is all about.

00:24:07.930 --> 00:24:10.340
And the people who are working
on it, what we all share.

00:24:10.340 --> 00:24:12.340
That red dot in
that orange circle

00:24:12.340 --> 00:24:15.310
represents a single soup
kitchen Washington, DC.

00:24:15.310 --> 00:24:18.309
9 mile radius circle
around it, 250 square miles

00:24:18.309 --> 00:24:19.850
and the question
is, how many growers

00:24:19.850 --> 00:24:21.840
live in 250 square miles?

00:24:21.840 --> 00:24:24.430
Depends on where you are,
but you know it's not zero.

00:24:24.430 --> 00:24:26.420
We've created the
opportunity for those growers

00:24:26.420 --> 00:24:28.490
to donate food to that pantry.

00:24:28.490 --> 00:24:30.830
And then look how many dots
are on the map right now.

00:24:30.830 --> 00:24:34.080
That's the amount of opportunity
that AmpleHarvest.org now

00:24:34.080 --> 00:24:36.370
represents, and
growing, to change

00:24:36.370 --> 00:24:38.620
the future of the country.

00:24:38.620 --> 00:24:40.907
The problem was-- and
a more interesting one,

00:24:40.907 --> 00:24:42.490
from the support
perspective, in terms

00:24:42.490 --> 00:24:44.420
of getting funding
from foundations.

00:24:44.420 --> 00:24:48.970
Your typical food
funding organization,

00:24:48.970 --> 00:24:51.630
working with a food
organization, works like this.

00:24:51.630 --> 00:24:55.320
They ask for $100 thousand,
$10,000 goes operation.

00:24:55.320 --> 00:24:56.949
$90,000 goes to food.

00:24:56.949 --> 00:24:58.740
You feed the families,
you run out of food,

00:24:58.740 --> 00:24:59.470
you come back again.

00:24:59.470 --> 00:25:00.428
You ask for more money.

00:25:00.428 --> 00:25:02.154
And that loop goes
on and on and on.

00:25:02.154 --> 00:25:03.570
And your bean
counters look at it,

00:25:03.570 --> 00:25:05.520
and they say, wow,
only 10% overhead,

00:25:05.520 --> 00:25:06.910
that's really kind of cool.

00:25:06.910 --> 00:25:08.890
Go with it.

00:25:08.890 --> 00:25:11.860
Then a scrappy young nonprofit
comes along and says,

00:25:11.860 --> 00:25:14.480
well, we don't need the
$90 thousand for the food.

00:25:14.480 --> 00:25:15.980
The food's already
in the community.

00:25:15.980 --> 00:25:20.850
We do need money for staff and
technology, so $10,000 please.

00:25:20.850 --> 00:25:23.090
You look at it first,
you say $10,000

00:25:23.090 --> 00:25:25.166
to permanently fix a
system that doesn't

00:25:25.166 --> 00:25:27.290
need to be refunded over
and over and over and over

00:25:27.290 --> 00:25:27.915
and over again?

00:25:27.915 --> 00:25:29.430
And you say, really cool.

00:25:29.430 --> 00:25:31.430
And then your bean counter
comes along and says,

00:25:31.430 --> 00:25:34.630
wait a minute,
it's 100% overhead.

00:25:34.630 --> 00:25:37.440
And suddenly, the bean counter
says, we can't help you out,

00:25:37.440 --> 00:25:39.850
because you're all overhead.

00:25:39.850 --> 00:25:42.670
Innovative ideas, I've
discovered in the charity

00:25:42.670 --> 00:25:45.190
world, with innovative
models, often

00:25:45.190 --> 00:25:48.130
struggle up against the
idea that with innovation,

00:25:48.130 --> 00:25:51.370
comes a roadblock from the
old ways of doing things.

00:25:54.330 --> 00:25:56.370
This is exactly the
type of PowerPoint slide

00:25:56.370 --> 00:25:57.800
you're not supposed to do.

00:25:57.800 --> 00:25:59.110
So I did it.

00:25:59.110 --> 00:26:00.640
Scan on the left hand side.

00:26:00.640 --> 00:26:02.140
And you're just going to
pick out one or two of them.

00:26:02.140 --> 00:26:04.515
These are emails that we've
received from people who say,

00:26:04.515 --> 00:26:06.630
I need help.

00:26:06.630 --> 00:26:08.310
On the right hand
hide, those are

00:26:08.310 --> 00:26:13.430
emails from people who
say, how can I help?

00:26:13.430 --> 00:26:15.230
This is America, side by side.

00:26:15.230 --> 00:26:17.980
50 people needing, help
42 million people saying,

00:26:17.980 --> 00:26:19.990
they can help.

00:26:19.990 --> 00:26:22.110
And all that's been
separating them

00:26:22.110 --> 00:26:24.262
has been the lack of
awareness that they already

00:26:24.262 --> 00:26:26.720
could be helping each other,
which is what AmpleHarvest.org

00:26:26.720 --> 00:26:29.050
has fixed, and continues to fix.

00:26:31.700 --> 00:26:34.780
Google has been an amazing
partner for AmpleHarvest.org.

00:26:34.780 --> 00:26:37.310
We're blessed and honored.

00:26:37.310 --> 00:26:40.450
And we want to-- just to
let you know how Googlers,

00:26:40.450 --> 00:26:43.460
how people here and people
watching can also help.

00:26:43.460 --> 00:26:45.800
One of the things is
AmpleHarvest.org/local,

00:26:45.800 --> 00:26:48.520
which is something open to
anybody and everybody across

00:26:48.520 --> 00:26:49.020
the country.

00:26:49.020 --> 00:26:50.440
The idea that there
are things you

00:26:50.440 --> 00:26:53.920
can do in your own community
to cement the AmpleHarvest.org

00:26:53.920 --> 00:26:55.030
model in your community.

00:26:55.030 --> 00:26:57.310
It takes a few hours of work.

00:26:57.310 --> 00:26:59.564
And it's a step by
step type of process.

00:26:59.564 --> 00:27:01.480
The second thing is
things specific to Google,

00:27:01.480 --> 00:27:03.480
including on that
Google page there,

00:27:03.480 --> 00:27:06.150
that fact that Google now
matches all donations to Hobbes

00:27:06.150 --> 00:27:09.260
AmpleHarvest.org, up to $6,000.

00:27:09.260 --> 00:27:12.150
I do speakers, and
also, we're looking

00:27:12.150 --> 00:27:13.570
for more engagement from people.

00:27:13.570 --> 00:27:16.090
So people who want to help
out have ideas, suggestions,

00:27:16.090 --> 00:27:18.790
whatever, I hope that
it's a type of thing that

00:27:18.790 --> 00:27:22.310
will move and inspire people.

00:27:22.310 --> 00:27:24.200
The heart behind
AmpleHarvest.org

00:27:24.200 --> 00:27:27.270
is the fact that
people are able to do

00:27:27.270 --> 00:27:29.280
things they thought
they couldn't do.

00:27:29.280 --> 00:27:31.850
Everybody wants to
be somebody special.

00:27:31.850 --> 00:27:35.660
I-- as a kid, I
wanted to be Superman.

00:27:35.660 --> 00:27:39.880
I used to fly into
my parents' bed.

00:27:39.880 --> 00:27:43.140
We grow up, eventually
thinking that that's just

00:27:43.140 --> 00:27:44.110
not the way it is.

00:27:44.110 --> 00:27:45.700
We have real lives.

00:27:45.700 --> 00:27:49.130
The reality is that
AmpleHarvest.org's model

00:27:49.130 --> 00:27:50.964
is enabling anybody
to be the game

00:27:50.964 --> 00:27:52.255
changer in their own community.

00:27:52.255 --> 00:27:54.440
I was actually--
CNN had asked me

00:27:54.440 --> 00:27:56.960
at one point, what's it
feel like to be a hero?

00:27:56.960 --> 00:27:58.710
And I said, it's
really not about me.

00:27:58.710 --> 00:28:00.630
This is about 42
million people being

00:28:00.630 --> 00:28:02.290
the hero in their own community.

00:28:02.290 --> 00:28:06.630
When I was a kid, my mother
loved Leonard Bernstein,

00:28:06.630 --> 00:28:07.680
the conductor.

00:28:07.680 --> 00:28:09.590
And I never got it.

00:28:09.590 --> 00:28:12.534
I saw a guy with his back to
the audience, waving a stick.

00:28:12.534 --> 00:28:14.950
And I said to her, the musicians
are making all the music.

00:28:14.950 --> 00:28:17.560
This guy's waving a stick.

00:28:17.560 --> 00:28:19.480
AmpleHarvest.org is
waving the stick.

00:28:19.480 --> 00:28:21.620
But it's 42 million
people across the country

00:28:21.620 --> 00:28:24.590
could make the difference in
the future of the country,

00:28:24.590 --> 00:28:27.970
the health of the
children, the economy,

00:28:27.970 --> 00:28:30.299
and the welfare of the nation.

00:28:30.299 --> 00:28:32.090
So I want to thank you
all very, very much.

00:28:32.090 --> 00:28:34.380
And I think Kim and I are
gonna have a brief question

00:28:34.380 --> 00:28:34.880
and answer.

00:28:34.880 --> 00:28:37.040
And then open it up to
questions from all of you.

00:28:37.040 --> 00:28:38.336
Thank you.

00:28:38.336 --> 00:28:42.080
[APPLAUSE]

00:28:42.080 --> 00:28:43.760
KIM: Thanks, very, Gary.

00:28:43.760 --> 00:28:45.555
That was very inspiring.

00:28:45.555 --> 00:28:47.605
GARY OPPENHEIMER: Thank you.

00:28:47.605 --> 00:28:49.480
KIM: Now, I'm going to
ask you some intensely

00:28:49.480 --> 00:28:50.560
personal question.

00:28:50.560 --> 00:28:51.640
GARY OPPENHEIMER: OK.

00:28:51.640 --> 00:28:52.940
KIM: They're not really.

00:28:52.940 --> 00:28:56.720
So you are a techie, a
gardener, an environmentalist.

00:28:56.720 --> 00:29:00.720
And then you created a
hunger food waste program.

00:29:00.720 --> 00:29:03.579
How did that happen?

00:29:03.579 --> 00:29:04.870
GARY OPPENHEIMER: I hate waste.

00:29:04.870 --> 00:29:06.860
Seriously, I grew up with,
finish what's on your plate.

00:29:06.860 --> 00:29:08.260
Kids are starving in Europe.

00:29:08.260 --> 00:29:11.887
And I saw the waste, and
I like solving problems.

00:29:11.887 --> 00:29:13.470
I mean, Vint had
talked about the fact

00:29:13.470 --> 00:29:17.270
that when I was a part of
MCI, I saw a company that

00:29:17.270 --> 00:29:20.000
had produced MCI Mail, a
really wonderful email service.

00:29:20.000 --> 00:29:22.333
But they weren't communicating
with their own customers.

00:29:22.333 --> 00:29:24.680
And I said, let me send
them out a newsletter.

00:29:24.680 --> 00:29:28.200
So I created the
newsletter, which

00:29:28.200 --> 00:29:31.250
maybe means I may have been one
of the first creators of spam.

00:29:31.250 --> 00:29:32.450
So my apologies.

00:29:32.450 --> 00:29:34.980
But the point was,
I see disconnects.

00:29:34.980 --> 00:29:36.520
And this was a clear disconnect.

00:29:36.520 --> 00:29:38.111
And it was an easy
one to fix too.

00:29:38.111 --> 00:29:39.610
Because nothing you
had to be built.

00:29:39.610 --> 00:29:41.680
It was just connecting the dots.

00:29:41.680 --> 00:29:43.438
And that's what got me to here.

00:29:43.438 --> 00:29:45.390
KIM: Cool.

00:29:45.390 --> 00:29:47.910
So since you've created
AmpleHarvest.org,

00:29:47.910 --> 00:29:51.661
what's been the most surprising
thing that you've learned?

00:29:51.661 --> 00:29:53.660
GARY OPPENHEIMER: What I
was just talking about.

00:29:53.660 --> 00:29:55.870
The difficulty
innovative charities

00:29:55.870 --> 00:29:57.650
have in getting support.

00:29:57.650 --> 00:29:59.220
I've seen lots of
other charities

00:29:59.220 --> 00:30:01.760
out there, with really great
ideas in all sorts of realms,

00:30:01.760 --> 00:30:04.820
struggle up against the fact
that they're doing new things.

00:30:04.820 --> 00:30:08.740
And the old way is
what's more accepted.

00:30:08.740 --> 00:30:11.800
Imagine for a minute, if you
built a better mouse trap,

00:30:11.800 --> 00:30:13.520
and you came to a
for-profit company,

00:30:13.520 --> 00:30:15.594
and they threw money
you to market it.

00:30:15.594 --> 00:30:17.760
And in a not for profit
world, the better mousetrap,

00:30:17.760 --> 00:30:20.770
they say, that's nice,
but we fund cats.

00:30:20.770 --> 00:30:21.870
This is in the problem.

00:30:21.870 --> 00:30:25.240
And I think it holds back the
improvement of our society.

00:30:25.240 --> 00:30:27.840
Because people who
have really good ideas

00:30:27.840 --> 00:30:29.266
get stymied, by
the fact that they

00:30:29.266 --> 00:30:30.890
can't be as impactful
as they could be.

00:30:30.890 --> 00:30:33.650
Just for lack of the old system
not catching up with them.

00:30:33.650 --> 00:30:37.970
There's a funding curve that
lags behind the innovation

00:30:37.970 --> 00:30:38.960
curve.

00:30:38.960 --> 00:30:40.970
That's been very frustrating.

00:30:40.970 --> 00:30:43.060
KIM: Well, maybe you
answered my next question.

00:30:43.060 --> 00:30:45.594
Which was, what's your
biggest disappointment?

00:30:45.594 --> 00:30:48.010
GARY OPPENHEIMER: In that vein,
the biggest disappointment

00:30:48.010 --> 00:30:52.240
is, we couldn't have done
more than we've done so far.

00:30:52.240 --> 00:30:54.700
This model, and others
like it-- by the way,

00:30:54.700 --> 00:30:57.650
this model is a no-brainer
for the country.

00:30:57.650 --> 00:31:00.640
And if we had the
staff, and the resources

00:31:00.640 --> 00:31:03.770
we need, we could have--
as impactful as we've been,

00:31:03.770 --> 00:31:06.440
we could have been much more
impactful, many times over.

00:31:06.440 --> 00:31:09.010
I was actually approached at
a conference that I was at.

00:31:09.010 --> 00:31:10.760
And we went in the
room with the big boys.

00:31:10.760 --> 00:31:12.520
You know, Oxfam and Red Cross.

00:31:12.520 --> 00:31:14.930
And somebody said, how
much money do you need?

00:31:14.930 --> 00:31:16.759
And I said 500.

00:31:16.759 --> 00:31:17.800
And the guy said million?

00:31:17.800 --> 00:31:19.260
I said, no, thousand.

00:31:19.260 --> 00:31:20.910
And he just gave
me a blank stare.

00:31:20.910 --> 00:31:22.785
It was sort of like,
how can you do something

00:31:22.785 --> 00:31:25.450
like-- this-- that's been
the frustrating thing.

00:31:28.170 --> 00:31:30.162
We're going to deal with it.

00:31:30.162 --> 00:31:32.140
[DEEP EXHALE]

00:31:32.140 --> 00:31:33.720
KIM: How do you
think that changes?

00:31:33.720 --> 00:31:35.210
How do you make that change?

00:31:35.210 --> 00:31:39.342
I mean, change those minds,
to get out of that old system?

00:31:39.342 --> 00:31:41.344
GARY OPPENHEIMER: Oh, gosh.

00:31:41.344 --> 00:31:42.510
You keep banging away at it.

00:31:42.510 --> 00:31:43.490
You keep working at it.

00:31:43.490 --> 00:31:44.390
You don't give up.

00:31:44.390 --> 00:31:46.840
You keep proving that it works.

00:31:46.840 --> 00:31:48.650
You don't lose heart.

00:31:48.650 --> 00:31:53.472
And you take solace in
that you are doing good,

00:31:53.472 --> 00:31:54.930
and you're making
the world better.

00:31:54.930 --> 00:31:56.410
You're leaving the place
better than you found it,

00:31:56.410 --> 00:31:58.868
which I think is the heart of
what anybody should be doing,

00:31:58.868 --> 00:32:02.209
if they want to get
into doing good.

00:32:02.209 --> 00:32:04.000
KIM: You touched on it
a bit, in your talk.

00:32:04.000 --> 00:32:07.260
But what are your long term
hopes for AmpleHarvest.org?

00:32:07.260 --> 00:32:10.214
GARY OPPENHEIMER: I'd like
to put us out of business.

00:32:10.214 --> 00:32:12.130
It sounds the glib to
say, because you'd never

00:32:12.130 --> 00:32:13.755
hear many other
organizations say that.

00:32:13.755 --> 00:32:15.790
But when you think about
it for a moment-- when

00:32:15.790 --> 00:32:18.534
I was growing up, and
I'll be 62 in November.

00:32:18.534 --> 00:32:19.950
When I was growing
up, people were

00:32:19.950 --> 00:32:21.860
looking for money for
polio, and smallpox.

00:32:21.860 --> 00:32:24.810
Anybody here get a solicitation
for either of those lately?

00:32:24.810 --> 00:32:25.470
No.

00:32:25.470 --> 00:32:27.350
They solved the problem,
and they went home.

00:32:27.350 --> 00:32:29.510
And I think a good charity
should find a problem,

00:32:29.510 --> 00:32:30.430
solve it, and go home.

00:32:30.430 --> 00:32:31.980
Because there's
lots of other places

00:32:31.980 --> 00:32:33.830
where money and
support is needed.

00:32:33.830 --> 00:32:37.370
And find the problem,
be able to fix it,

00:32:37.370 --> 00:32:40.290
or at least severely
diminish the problem.

00:32:40.290 --> 00:32:41.460
And be done with it.

00:32:41.460 --> 00:32:44.070
I think we can get to
a point in America,

00:32:44.070 --> 00:32:46.100
where everybody
looks at excess food

00:32:46.100 --> 00:32:48.556
the same way we all look
at, for example, old coats.

00:32:48.556 --> 00:32:51.180
You get an old coat, what's the
first thing that comes to mind?

00:32:51.180 --> 00:32:53.615
The Goodwill bin or
something else down the road.

00:32:53.615 --> 00:32:55.490
You drop it off, hoping
that somebody else is

00:32:55.490 --> 00:32:57.270
going to be able to use the coat
that you don't want anymore.

00:32:57.270 --> 00:32:59.070
We should be doing that
with all of our food.

00:32:59.070 --> 00:33:01.370
If we have more food-- and it's
not just gardeners, by the way.

00:33:01.370 --> 00:33:03.760
But if we have more food than
we could then we can use,

00:33:03.760 --> 00:33:05.861
we should be finding
ways, either not

00:33:05.861 --> 00:33:08.360
to have purchased and prepared
that much in the first place;

00:33:08.360 --> 00:33:10.520
or if we have it,
especially fresh food,

00:33:10.520 --> 00:33:12.770
get it to people who
really, really need it.

00:33:12.770 --> 00:33:17.240
It is a-- it's really--
forgive the pun,

00:33:17.240 --> 00:33:19.926
it's the low hanging fruit in
solving so many of our problems

00:33:19.926 --> 00:33:20.550
in our country.

00:33:20.550 --> 00:33:21.150
It really is.

00:33:21.150 --> 00:33:24.602
You get kids eating fresh food,
instead of processed food.

00:33:24.602 --> 00:33:26.810
You get the eating potatoes,
instead of potato chips.

00:33:26.810 --> 00:33:29.143
You get them to learn that
Apple's don't come pre-sliced

00:33:29.143 --> 00:33:30.080
in cellophane.

00:33:30.080 --> 00:33:33.380
You start to change the future
of how these kids grow up.

00:33:33.380 --> 00:33:36.980
And the diabetes
and obesity problems

00:33:36.980 --> 00:33:40.960
that is going to really hurt
this country gets thwarted.

00:33:40.960 --> 00:33:42.630
It's not hard to do.

00:33:42.630 --> 00:33:45.900
And it's not expensive at all.

00:33:45.900 --> 00:33:48.540
KIM: So you are touching
the world of food, waste,

00:33:48.540 --> 00:33:52.290
and hunger all the time,
what's the most difficult story

00:33:52.290 --> 00:33:53.500
that you've come across?

00:33:53.500 --> 00:33:55.810
GARY OPPENHEIMER: Yeah.

00:33:55.810 --> 00:33:57.900
You saw that list
of emails I put up?

00:33:57.900 --> 00:33:59.110
That was a small sampling.

00:33:59.110 --> 00:34:01.526
We get emails from people all
the time saying, I'm hungry,

00:34:01.526 --> 00:34:03.214
I need help.

00:34:03.214 --> 00:34:03.880
Can you help us?

00:34:03.880 --> 00:34:04.800
And we can't actually.

00:34:04.800 --> 00:34:05.890
That's not our role.

00:34:05.890 --> 00:34:07.720
Remember, we're
fixing this pipeline,

00:34:07.720 --> 00:34:09.630
from the growers
to food pantries.

00:34:09.630 --> 00:34:11.159
We don't feed people.

00:34:11.159 --> 00:34:13.410
We're partnered with both
WhyHunger.org and the United

00:34:13.410 --> 00:34:13.909
Way.

00:34:13.909 --> 00:34:16.400
WhyHunger.org particularly,
is an amazing organization.

00:34:16.400 --> 00:34:18.969
And their job is to
connect a hungry family

00:34:18.969 --> 00:34:22.562
to food resource in
their own community.

00:34:22.562 --> 00:34:23.770
So we send them off that way.

00:34:23.770 --> 00:34:26.217
But by the way, each person
that does some of those emails

00:34:26.217 --> 00:34:28.300
gets a reply from myself
or somebody else, saying,

00:34:28.300 --> 00:34:29.550
we're really sorry.

00:34:29.550 --> 00:34:33.130
Here's where you can go.

00:34:33.130 --> 00:34:35.820
One woman wrote to me,
one of those letters.

00:34:35.820 --> 00:34:38.294
I'm having a difficult time.

00:34:38.294 --> 00:34:40.760
I can't feed my family,
my husband's ill.

00:34:40.760 --> 00:34:42.610
I don't remember
the details of it,

00:34:42.610 --> 00:34:45.920
but what blew me off was
when I saw the bottom.

00:34:45.920 --> 00:34:47.850
She was active duty US Navy.

00:34:47.850 --> 00:34:49.940
That hurt.

00:34:49.940 --> 00:34:50.810
That shouldn't be.

00:34:50.810 --> 00:34:53.699
Sorry, I get choked
up about that still.

00:34:53.699 --> 00:34:55.809
That was tough.

00:34:55.809 --> 00:34:57.100
That was the toughest probably.

00:34:59.690 --> 00:35:02.730
But that's what's going
on in the country.

00:35:02.730 --> 00:35:05.980
KIM: Can you tell us
one of the best stories?

00:35:05.980 --> 00:35:07.111
GARY OPPENHEIMER: Yeah.

00:35:07.111 --> 00:35:08.610
I actually have it
on my thing here.

00:35:08.610 --> 00:35:11.210
I want to read it, because
it's that good a story.

00:35:11.210 --> 00:35:12.920
This was an email
that I'd gotten,

00:35:12.920 --> 00:35:16.710
and I hope it's still hear.

00:35:16.710 --> 00:35:24.390
A woman who was raising a bunch
of kids, and she had let's see,

00:35:24.390 --> 00:35:26.100
here we go-- I'm
gonna just read this.

00:35:26.100 --> 00:35:27.580
So you can see what
this-- this was just

00:35:27.580 --> 00:35:28.860
a wonderful,
wonderful short story.

00:35:28.860 --> 00:35:29.859
I'm the mother of seven.

00:35:29.859 --> 00:35:32.756
15 grandchildren and
others, that I'm mom to.

00:35:32.756 --> 00:35:34.380
We have a garden,
that we plant for us.

00:35:34.380 --> 00:35:36.730
But it's not enough.

00:35:36.730 --> 00:35:38.900
She got the kids planting food.

00:35:38.900 --> 00:35:41.310
She got the kids involved
in the gardening.

00:35:41.310 --> 00:35:45.690
And the kids got really, really
excited about seeing the food

00:35:45.690 --> 00:35:46.704
growing.

00:35:46.704 --> 00:35:49.370
If you could see the garden, the
faces of the babies when they--

00:35:49.370 --> 00:35:51.940
and quote, unquote, 'babies,'--
when they go out and the food

00:35:51.940 --> 00:35:54.273
and the veggies for supper,
it was so wonderful for them

00:35:54.273 --> 00:35:55.202
to get fresh veggies.

00:35:55.202 --> 00:35:56.160
That was good for them.

00:35:56.160 --> 00:36:00.430
One of my babies last year
ate every tomato on one plant.

00:36:00.430 --> 00:36:02.560
These were his tomatoes.

00:36:02.560 --> 00:36:05.510
The mom said he hated them, but
sure enough changed her mind

00:36:05.510 --> 00:36:07.260
when he was eating them, here.

00:36:07.260 --> 00:36:10.380
We have lemon trees, pineapple
trees, et cetera, et cetera.

00:36:10.380 --> 00:36:13.260
Kids react to the
fact-- when they

00:36:13.260 --> 00:36:17.370
can taste what a real piece
of produce tastes like,

00:36:17.370 --> 00:36:18.120
it changes them.

00:36:18.120 --> 00:36:20.760
And this kid, whoever this
kid is, is changed for life.

00:36:20.760 --> 00:36:23.800
And this happens to millions
of kids across the country.

00:36:23.800 --> 00:36:24.690
That's great.

00:36:24.690 --> 00:36:27.880
That offsets the Navy lady
story, many times over.

00:36:27.880 --> 00:36:28.897
It's really nice.

00:36:28.897 --> 00:36:29.980
KIM: That's a great story.

00:36:29.980 --> 00:36:31.500
That's a good one.

00:36:31.500 --> 00:36:35.506
So what would you being doing if
you weren't doing AmpleHarvest?

00:36:35.506 --> 00:36:37.550
GARY OPPENHEIMER:
[DEEP EXHALE] The glib answer,

00:36:37.550 --> 00:36:38.397
is I'd be biking.

00:36:38.397 --> 00:36:39.480
I'm a long distance biker.

00:36:39.480 --> 00:36:39.750
KIM: I knew you were gonna--

00:36:39.750 --> 00:36:41.749
GARY OPPENHEIMER: but
flying across country, you

00:36:41.749 --> 00:36:43.640
can't really-- I
have other ideas

00:36:43.640 --> 00:36:45.390
for things I'd like to do.

00:36:45.390 --> 00:36:46.470
I've had one dream.

00:36:46.470 --> 00:36:47.614
I figured it out.

00:36:47.614 --> 00:36:49.030
I didn't even
figure it out, I was

00:36:49.030 --> 00:36:51.238
taught in first grade had
end gridlock in Washington.

00:36:51.238 --> 00:36:53.190
And it's a stupid simple idea.

00:36:53.190 --> 00:36:54.970
I'd love to find a
way to incorporate--

00:36:54.970 --> 00:36:58.130
stop having these people sit
here, and that people sit here.

00:36:58.130 --> 00:37:00.200
Make Congress sit in
alphabetical order.

00:37:00.200 --> 00:37:02.044
And I bet you problems
start to dissolve,

00:37:02.044 --> 00:37:03.460
because people
talk to each other.

00:37:03.460 --> 00:37:05.940
Things like that-- these are
not complex problems to solve.

00:37:05.940 --> 00:37:06.982
They're easy to do.

00:37:06.982 --> 00:37:08.315
And I put my energies into that.

00:37:08.315 --> 00:37:10.730
But I'd still get the
cross country bike ride in.

00:37:10.730 --> 00:37:12.865
KIM: OK.

00:37:12.865 --> 00:37:14.240
Now you said that
Google has been

00:37:14.240 --> 00:37:15.780
an immense part
of AmpleHarvest's

00:37:15.780 --> 00:37:17.355
nationwide success.

00:37:17.355 --> 00:37:18.730
GARY OPPENHEIMER:
Yeah, big time.

00:37:18.730 --> 00:37:20.410
KIM: What can
individual Googlers

00:37:20.410 --> 00:37:24.330
do to help move AmpleHarvest
to the next level?

00:37:24.330 --> 00:37:27.010
And maybe not just
Googlers, but anybody?

00:37:30.007 --> 00:37:31.340
GARY OPPENHEIMER: We love ideas.

00:37:31.340 --> 00:37:32.490
We love energy.

00:37:32.490 --> 00:37:34.240
We love people getting involved.

00:37:34.240 --> 00:37:34.740
And funding.

00:37:34.740 --> 00:37:36.656
I mean, one of the nice
things I said earlier,

00:37:36.656 --> 00:37:38.590
was that Google actually
matches donations.

00:37:38.590 --> 00:37:40.925
But this is something,
this is a viral campaign,

00:37:40.925 --> 00:37:42.500
a viral program, frankly.

00:37:42.500 --> 00:37:44.840
I mean, once you know
how to fix the problem

00:37:44.840 --> 00:37:46.706
in your own community,
you can spread it

00:37:46.706 --> 00:37:49.080
across your own community,
without having any involvement

00:37:49.080 --> 00:37:49.930
from us.

00:37:49.930 --> 00:37:52.400
So whether you're a
Googler, or whether you're

00:37:52.400 --> 00:37:57.387
anybody else in the country,
spreading the word-- taking

00:37:57.387 --> 00:37:59.470
the effort yourself not
to waste food, by the way.

00:37:59.470 --> 00:38:01.780
And there are many-- Jonathan
Bloom, by the way, who's

00:38:01.780 --> 00:38:05.270
part of our organization,
has an amazing book, called

00:38:05.270 --> 00:38:06.240
'America Wasteland.

00:38:06.240 --> 00:38:07.400
His blog is WastedFood.com.

00:38:07.400 --> 00:38:09.410
Take a look at
it, or take a look

00:38:09.410 --> 00:38:12.650
at that Tristram Stuart
Ted talk on food waste.

00:38:12.650 --> 00:38:15.070
Both of these are really
good places to look to see,

00:38:15.070 --> 00:38:17.650
what are we doing, and what
could we be doing better?

00:38:17.650 --> 00:38:20.410
So looking at how you
doing-- what you could

00:38:20.410 --> 00:38:21.610
do better about food waste.

00:38:21.610 --> 00:38:23.960
But we've had people within
Google who have stepped up

00:38:23.960 --> 00:38:25.610
and said, I'm an engineer.

00:38:25.610 --> 00:38:27.430
I do this, and I want to help.

00:38:27.430 --> 00:38:30.252
Vint Cerf; Carla LaFever,
who worked with him, these

00:38:30.252 --> 00:38:31.960
are amazing who have
stepped up and said,

00:38:31.960 --> 00:38:34.660
we want to be a part of
this and we want to help.

00:38:34.660 --> 00:38:37.570
The help-- this is a small
organization, just so you know.

00:38:37.570 --> 00:38:40.196
At this point, we're
three and a half people.

00:38:40.196 --> 00:38:41.820
I mean, think about
the national impact

00:38:41.820 --> 00:38:42.950
for three and a half people.

00:38:42.950 --> 00:38:44.230
We're supposed to
be seven people.

00:38:44.230 --> 00:38:46.390
That's where our half million
dollar budget actually openly

00:38:46.390 --> 00:38:47.720
goes to, with all the
technology and everything.

00:38:47.720 --> 00:38:50.060
It's never going to
be a big organization.

00:38:50.060 --> 00:38:52.150
That means that people
coming in and helping out,

00:38:52.150 --> 00:38:53.840
can be immensely helpful.

00:38:53.840 --> 00:38:56.960
The opportunity to be a part of
the change, to make a change,

00:38:56.960 --> 00:38:59.350
to influence a
change, is immense.

00:38:59.350 --> 00:39:02.370
And I can't think of a
better talent of pool

00:39:02.370 --> 00:39:05.690
then people like,
like what Google has.

00:39:05.690 --> 00:39:08.220
I mean, people coming in
with ideas, not afraid

00:39:08.220 --> 00:39:09.690
of innovation.

00:39:09.690 --> 00:39:12.460
Not afraid to experiment
and risk succeeding,

00:39:12.460 --> 00:39:17.740
I think is an amazing thing for
Google and AmpleHarvest.org.

00:39:17.740 --> 00:39:20.777
And of course, honestly
funding support.

00:39:20.777 --> 00:39:23.360
Any place people can find ways
to help support us financially,

00:39:23.360 --> 00:39:25.740
will help us get past the
point of asking for money,

00:39:25.740 --> 00:39:27.640
and doing more
with the money, is

00:39:27.640 --> 00:39:30.590
immensely helpful to the
future, health and wealth,

00:39:30.590 --> 00:39:33.050
as Vint put it, of America.

00:39:33.050 --> 00:39:34.090
KIM: Thanks, Gary.

00:39:34.090 --> 00:39:35.256
GARY OPPENHEIMER: Thank you.

00:39:35.256 --> 00:39:37.850
KIM: I think it's time to
turn it over to you guys.

00:39:37.850 --> 00:39:40.220
So if anyone has a question,
I can pass the mic.

00:39:44.470 --> 00:39:48.210
Or I think that's working
over there too, if you want.

00:39:48.210 --> 00:39:49.330
I'll go on this side.

00:39:49.330 --> 00:39:50.913
I'm just going to
walk back and forth.

00:39:52.984 --> 00:39:53.650
AUDIENCE: Hello.

00:39:53.650 --> 00:39:54.525
GARY OPPENHEIMER: Hi.

00:39:54.525 --> 00:39:56.530
AUDIENCE: To ask a beam
counter-y question,

00:39:56.530 --> 00:39:59.360
do you have an estimate of
the dollar value of the goods

00:39:59.360 --> 00:40:04.140
that you've facilitated, moving
from growers to the food banks?

00:40:04.140 --> 00:40:05.050
GARY OPPENHEIMER: No.

00:40:05.050 --> 00:40:06.300
That's a really good question.

00:40:06.300 --> 00:40:09.020
And I appreciate you leading
in with the bean counter type

00:40:09.020 --> 00:40:09.520
thing.

00:40:09.520 --> 00:40:13.390
But it's-- honestly, the dollar
value is not as important

00:40:13.390 --> 00:40:15.030
as the nutritional value.

00:40:15.030 --> 00:40:18.470
Because the nutritional value
represents a multiplier effect.

00:40:18.470 --> 00:40:21.640
I'm making up a number; if
I donate $100 of tomatoes,

00:40:21.640 --> 00:40:26.100
I've benefited the
community by $100, frankly.

00:40:26.100 --> 00:40:29.990
But if I donate $100 worth
of health, the long term

00:40:29.990 --> 00:40:31.350
impact of that.

00:40:31.350 --> 00:40:34.030
In terms of the reduction
of future health issues,

00:40:34.030 --> 00:40:37.060
many times magnifies that over.

00:40:37.060 --> 00:40:38.560
From a metrics
perspective, I should

00:40:38.560 --> 00:40:41.597
say that the discussion that's
always been with food has been,

00:40:41.597 --> 00:40:42.930
how many pounds, how many meals?

00:40:42.930 --> 00:40:44.790
I touched on that.

00:40:44.790 --> 00:40:47.880
In the fresh food realm,
poundage doesn't really

00:40:47.880 --> 00:40:48.860
make a lot of sense.

00:40:48.860 --> 00:40:50.443
How are you going
to compare donations

00:40:50.443 --> 00:40:51.980
of watermelon and spinach?

00:40:51.980 --> 00:40:55.630
The same weight of the two,
spinach is immensely more help,

00:40:55.630 --> 00:40:58.890
beneficial to the community and
the country then watermelon is.

00:40:58.890 --> 00:41:00.730
One of the projects
we have lined up,

00:41:00.730 --> 00:41:02.860
and the Clinton people
would like to see us do it,

00:41:02.860 --> 00:41:05.010
is the Community
Nutritional Index.

00:41:05.010 --> 00:41:07.780
The this is a model that
I have in my mind, that

00:41:07.780 --> 00:41:11.010
takes what I used to
see in PC Magazine,

00:41:11.010 --> 00:41:13.710
in my geeky days, which is
how you sort of measured

00:41:13.710 --> 00:41:16.255
the relative value of
this brand of computer,

00:41:16.255 --> 00:41:19.556
versus that brand of computer,
and apply it to fresh food.

00:41:19.556 --> 00:41:21.180
Which would then
start to get us closer

00:41:21.180 --> 00:41:22.560
to the financial
question you're asking.

00:41:22.560 --> 00:41:24.480
Because under that
scenario, we can then

00:41:24.480 --> 00:41:26.800
realize that a
pound of watermelon,

00:41:26.800 --> 00:41:28.420
is equal to this much of this.

00:41:28.420 --> 00:41:31.670
And look at the individual
macro and micro nutrient.

00:41:31.670 --> 00:41:34.840
That can then get translated
to a dollar value.

00:41:34.840 --> 00:41:37.120
One of the informal advisers
for AmpleHarvest.org

00:41:37.120 --> 00:41:38.920
is Rear Admiral Dr.
Susan Blumenthal,

00:41:38.920 --> 00:41:40.400
who is the former
Assistant Surgeon

00:41:40.400 --> 00:41:41.608
General of the United States.

00:41:41.608 --> 00:41:45.910
So we have access to a
wealth of medical input,

00:41:45.910 --> 00:41:49.490
and health ideas
along those lines.

00:41:49.490 --> 00:41:54.340
We've documented informally,
many, many tens of millions

00:41:54.340 --> 00:41:56.870
of dollars of-- tens
of millions of pounds,

00:41:56.870 --> 00:41:58.920
I'm sorry-- of food
having come in.

00:41:58.920 --> 00:42:01.510
Why can't we give
you an exact number?

00:42:01.510 --> 00:42:03.060
If you remember
that big green line

00:42:03.060 --> 00:42:05.090
that came from the
gardener to the pantry?

00:42:05.090 --> 00:42:06.594
The food doesn't
pass through us.

00:42:06.594 --> 00:42:08.510
We don't touch the food,
there's no logistics.

00:42:08.510 --> 00:42:10.470
We ask people to tell
us what you've donated.

00:42:10.470 --> 00:42:12.136
But the other side
is the food pantries,

00:42:12.136 --> 00:42:13.920
are really lousy at metrics.

00:42:13.920 --> 00:42:15.360
They don't have scales.

00:42:15.360 --> 00:42:18.310
We ask them how much
food, we get bags.

00:42:18.310 --> 00:42:19.200
We get boxes.

00:42:19.200 --> 00:42:20.190
We get bushels.

00:42:20.190 --> 00:42:24.190
We get-- one food pantry--
we did an early survey,

00:42:24.190 --> 00:42:26.495
and we said how many
pounds of food did you get,

00:42:26.495 --> 00:42:27.370
did you possibly get?

00:42:27.370 --> 00:42:30.620
This is probably in 2010, we
were less than a year old.

00:42:30.620 --> 00:42:33.500
They said 9 million pounds.

00:42:33.500 --> 00:42:35.120
We were seeing
numbers like none.

00:42:35.120 --> 00:42:36.020
500 pounds.

00:42:36.020 --> 00:42:36.690
25 pounds.

00:42:36.690 --> 00:42:37.210
9 million?

00:42:37.210 --> 00:42:40.710
I call this person up,
and said, is this a typo?

00:42:40.710 --> 00:42:41.485
They said no.

00:42:41.485 --> 00:42:41.985
No.

00:42:41.985 --> 00:42:44.070
A farmer heard about us,
through AmpleHarvest.org,

00:42:44.070 --> 00:42:45.736
and started bringing
truckloads of food.

00:42:48.200 --> 00:42:49.230
How do you measure that?

00:42:49.230 --> 00:42:51.630
Other then, it's
just-- I was stunned.

00:42:51.630 --> 00:42:52.784
I was thrilled.

00:42:52.784 --> 00:42:55.200
One other question about the
success of AmpleHarvest.org I

00:42:55.200 --> 00:42:56.910
feel like I have to point out.

00:42:56.910 --> 00:42:58.020
Because I was asked
earlier on how do you

00:42:58.020 --> 00:42:59.186
know when you're successful?

00:42:59.186 --> 00:43:01.110
And I said, this is has
been my true feeling.

00:43:01.110 --> 00:43:03.520
We're successful, when
the first gardener

00:43:03.520 --> 00:43:06.310
donates the first
delivery of food.

00:43:06.310 --> 00:43:08.560
Everything else after is
just building on the success.

00:43:08.560 --> 00:43:11.210
But the success was the
first time food was donated.

00:43:11.210 --> 00:43:14.370
I hope someday we can
give you dollar number.

00:43:14.370 --> 00:43:16.290
But I'd much rather
actually say,

00:43:16.290 --> 00:43:18.880
this many more people don't
have colorectal cancer.

00:43:18.880 --> 00:43:21.950
Or this many more people
don't have type 2 diabetes.

00:43:21.950 --> 00:43:23.446
I'll let somebody
else figure out

00:43:23.446 --> 00:43:24.820
what that's worth
to the country.

00:43:24.820 --> 00:43:27.002
I'd like to simply say
we've saved this many lives,

00:43:27.002 --> 00:43:28.460
or we've prolonged
this many lives.

00:43:28.460 --> 00:43:33.330
Or we've reduced this amount
of illness in the country, OK?

00:43:33.330 --> 00:43:34.300
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

00:43:34.300 --> 00:43:35.060
Cool.

00:43:35.060 --> 00:43:36.690
Hey, thank you,
first of all, Gary,

00:43:36.690 --> 00:43:38.094
for sharing that story with us.

00:43:38.094 --> 00:43:39.260
GARY OPPENHEIMER: Thank you.

00:43:39.260 --> 00:43:42.420
AUDIENCE: Really cool
just to hear your vision.

00:43:42.420 --> 00:43:44.500
I was really curious
to understand-- can you

00:43:44.500 --> 00:43:47.280
talk to us a little bit more
about some of the big problems

00:43:47.280 --> 00:43:48.530
and challenges that you faced?

00:43:48.530 --> 00:43:52.904
Obviously raising
money, and the old model

00:43:52.904 --> 00:43:54.570
for thinking about
success, is something

00:43:54.570 --> 00:43:55.987
that you've told us about.

00:43:55.987 --> 00:43:58.320
But what are some of the other
challenges that you face,

00:43:58.320 --> 00:43:59.950
and then maybe as
a kind of followup,

00:43:59.950 --> 00:44:02.920
talk a little bit
more about what

00:44:02.920 --> 00:44:05.780
an incremental or $500
thousand more can do for you.

00:44:05.780 --> 00:44:07.481
Obviously, hiring more people.

00:44:07.481 --> 00:44:08.980
What would those
people, maybe like,

00:44:08.980 --> 00:44:10.105
what would those people do?

00:44:12.620 --> 00:44:13.989
Why that number?

00:44:13.989 --> 00:44:15.530
Well, let's start
with the first one.

00:44:15.530 --> 00:44:15.930
GARY OPPENHEIMER: OK.

00:44:15.930 --> 00:44:17.440
AUDIENCE: The challenges.

00:44:17.440 --> 00:44:21.095
The challenges that you guys
face, outside of fundraising.

00:44:21.095 --> 00:44:21.970
GARY OPPENHEIMER: OK.

00:44:21.970 --> 00:44:25.420
The challenge-- well, in
effect-- and I alluded to this,

00:44:25.420 --> 00:44:27.710
I think, is that we spend
enough time worrying about,

00:44:27.710 --> 00:44:29.085
and chasing money,
that we're not

00:44:29.085 --> 00:44:31.140
doing all the good we
can and should be doing?

00:44:31.140 --> 00:44:32.870
And my dream scenario,
to be honest,

00:44:32.870 --> 00:44:34.453
and I've said this--
the guy who asked

00:44:34.453 --> 00:44:37.700
me the question about that 500
at the conference-- I followed

00:44:37.700 --> 00:44:39.900
up with, if we got $2
million, and you came back

00:44:39.900 --> 00:44:42.060
in four years,
we'd be able to you

00:44:42.060 --> 00:44:43.870
the magnitude of
impact on America.

00:44:43.870 --> 00:44:47.380
Because it's that cheap to
be that big as an influence.

00:44:47.380 --> 00:44:50.140
Understanding something, what
AmpleHarvest.org is doing,

00:44:50.140 --> 00:44:54.560
and what other small charities
like AmpleHarvest.org is doing,

00:44:54.560 --> 00:44:56.599
we're not moving mountains.

00:44:56.599 --> 00:44:58.140
And we don't have
to move a mountain.

00:44:58.140 --> 00:44:59.514
We've put a pebble
in somebody's,

00:44:59.514 --> 00:45:01.830
a pebble in the
shoe stops an army,

00:45:01.830 --> 00:45:03.550
that a mountain couldn't stop.

00:45:03.550 --> 00:45:06.450
So it doesn't take a lot to
redirect the way things are

00:45:06.450 --> 00:45:08.730
going, to make things
actually happen.

00:45:08.730 --> 00:45:11.680
What we would be doing with
that, is the other programs

00:45:11.680 --> 00:45:13.510
that we want to build,
gleaningharvest.org,

00:45:13.510 --> 00:45:16.790
Producepedia, and
Nutritional Index

00:45:16.790 --> 00:45:18.060
would have been built by now.

00:45:18.060 --> 00:45:21.860
Producepedia is
really very important.

00:45:21.860 --> 00:45:26.030
This sort of came on my radar
when a teacher wrote to me.

00:45:26.030 --> 00:45:27.670
We were probably
about a year old.

00:45:27.670 --> 00:45:31.620
She said she brought an
apple, a cucumber and a-- I

00:45:31.620 --> 00:45:35.130
think it was a pare or
something, into her classroom.

00:45:35.130 --> 00:45:37.269
And most the kids have no
idea what a cucumber was.

00:45:37.269 --> 00:45:39.060
And I suspect they knew
what the apple was,

00:45:39.060 --> 00:45:40.476
because they
probably had iPhones.

00:45:40.476 --> 00:45:44.290
But really people are
disconnected from the food.

00:45:44.290 --> 00:45:45.790
And so the idea
behind Producepedia,

00:45:45.790 --> 00:45:48.080
what we want to
build, is something

00:45:48.080 --> 00:45:53.400
whereby we will have a database
of all the foods people grow.

00:45:53.400 --> 00:45:56.450
And I'm not just saying apples
and carrots and oranges,

00:45:56.450 --> 00:46:00.030
I'm talking about very,
very, very granularly.

00:46:00.030 --> 00:46:01.560
I grow tomatoes.

00:46:01.560 --> 00:46:03.535
Now, we all have tomatoes.

00:46:03.535 --> 00:46:05.660
You have the red tomatoes,
and the yellow tomatoes,

00:46:05.660 --> 00:46:07.140
and the cherry tomatoes.

00:46:07.140 --> 00:46:10.030
And there are-- anybody
see an Icelandic tomato?

00:46:10.030 --> 00:46:10.530
No.

00:46:10.530 --> 00:46:11.860
They're white. krim tomatoes?

00:46:11.860 --> 00:46:12.550
Black.

00:46:12.550 --> 00:46:15.000
So if I were to bring
Icelandic tomatoes into a food

00:46:15.000 --> 00:46:17.720
pantry, or a krim one, which
is black, people would say,

00:46:17.720 --> 00:46:19.320
I don't know.

00:46:19.320 --> 00:46:22.760
The idea behind Producepedia
is to create a print out,

00:46:22.760 --> 00:46:24.490
a simple print
out, that not only

00:46:24.490 --> 00:46:27.000
says what the food is, with
a picture, inside, outside.

00:46:27.000 --> 00:46:28.750
But some basic
information about it,

00:46:28.750 --> 00:46:30.430
so that the pantry
and the people,

00:46:30.430 --> 00:46:31.570
they would know what
they're getting.

00:46:31.570 --> 00:46:32.528
And what to do with it.

00:46:32.528 --> 00:46:33.520
Do you eat it raw?

00:46:33.520 --> 00:46:34.240
Do you cook it?

00:46:34.240 --> 00:46:36.240
Or whatever.

00:46:36.240 --> 00:46:37.770
So the food wouldn't
go to waste.

00:46:37.770 --> 00:46:39.395
I grew purple carrots
one year, my wife

00:46:39.395 --> 00:46:42.300
didn't know what to
do with the stuff.

00:46:42.300 --> 00:46:45.350
So you can imagine what
it's like on a larger scale.

00:46:45.350 --> 00:46:48.830
The programs are lined
up, that I want to build.

00:46:48.830 --> 00:46:51.360
The staffing is what's
needed to actually expand

00:46:51.360 --> 00:46:54.650
AmpleHarvest.org, to its
full potential impact.

00:46:54.650 --> 00:46:56.530
Just to give you an
idea of-- the staff

00:46:56.530 --> 00:46:58.720
consists of one
person whose full time

00:46:58.720 --> 00:47:00.210
work is to work
with the pantries.

00:47:00.210 --> 00:47:03.750
And every pantry that
signs up, all 7,000,

00:47:03.750 --> 00:47:05.360
have been vetted by this person.

00:47:05.360 --> 00:47:07.065
Or by somebody in her position.

00:47:07.065 --> 00:47:08.940
We want to make sure,
when a pantry signs up,

00:47:08.940 --> 00:47:09.990
that it's really a pantry.

00:47:09.990 --> 00:47:12.365
And if it fits our criteria
of giving food away for free,

00:47:12.365 --> 00:47:13.630
and being a nonprofit.

00:47:13.630 --> 00:47:15.990
That it's not something
it shouldn't really be.

00:47:15.990 --> 00:47:17.660
So we're verifying each one.

00:47:17.660 --> 00:47:19.540
The other one, she's
involved in reaching out

00:47:19.540 --> 00:47:22.123
to the gardeners across America,
saying the solution to hunger

00:47:22.123 --> 00:47:23.550
is in your backyard.

00:47:23.550 --> 00:47:25.740
I'm there, sort of
running the whole thing,

00:47:25.740 --> 00:47:27.520
and trying to push
the message out.

00:47:27.520 --> 00:47:28.900
And we have a part time admin.

00:47:28.900 --> 00:47:32.480
We need a few more people to
do the stuff, the technology,

00:47:32.480 --> 00:47:34.630
and all the other pieces
that are in there.

00:47:34.630 --> 00:47:36.480
But Producepedia would
be the final step

00:47:36.480 --> 00:47:38.146
in making sure that
people at the pantry

00:47:38.146 --> 00:47:39.630
make the best use of the food.

00:47:39.630 --> 00:47:42.320
The gleaningharvest.org,
as I said,

00:47:42.320 --> 00:47:44.540
will dwarf
AmpleHarvest.org, in terms

00:47:44.540 --> 00:47:47.450
of the amount of food
coming into the system.

00:47:47.450 --> 00:47:50.600
If you look at the end NRDC
reports-- and if, by the way,

00:47:50.600 --> 00:47:53.160
anybody who wants to
see the presentation,

00:47:53.160 --> 00:47:55.822
if you go to
AmpleHarvest.org/googletechtalk,

00:47:55.822 --> 00:47:57.530
it'll be a PDF you
can freely downloaded.

00:47:57.530 --> 00:48:00.550
It's available right now.

00:48:00.550 --> 00:48:04.250
The gleaningharvest.org,
is going to connect people

00:48:04.250 --> 00:48:06.234
to organizations they
never we knew existed.

00:48:06.234 --> 00:48:08.150
I go into places all the
time full of foodies,

00:48:08.150 --> 00:48:10.524
and I say do you know gleaners
or gleaning organizations?

00:48:10.524 --> 00:48:11.992
Many people don't.

00:48:11.992 --> 00:48:14.200
It's in the Old Testament,
Book of Ruth, Deuteronomy,

00:48:14.200 --> 00:48:16.224
you know, leave the
food in the corners,

00:48:16.224 --> 00:48:17.390
in the edges of your fields.

00:48:17.390 --> 00:48:19.050
Don't pick up what
you drop, it's

00:48:19.050 --> 00:48:20.980
for the poor, the
widow, and the traveler.

00:48:20.980 --> 00:48:22.750
We have organizations
in this country that

00:48:22.750 --> 00:48:25.110
are volunteers, people, and
most important, insurance,

00:48:25.110 --> 00:48:28.450
who will come to farm or
your community garden,

00:48:28.450 --> 00:48:31.520
harvest the food, and get it to
the people who really need it.

00:48:31.520 --> 00:48:34.190
Except nobody knows they exist.

00:48:34.190 --> 00:48:36.424
We want to build the bridge,
built on Google Maps,

00:48:36.424 --> 00:48:37.840
that's going to
connect the people

00:48:37.840 --> 00:48:40.423
with these organizations, bring
them together, and again, once

00:48:40.423 --> 00:48:42.056
that connection's
made, its permanent.

00:48:42.056 --> 00:48:43.680
And then when after
the farmer harvests

00:48:43.680 --> 00:48:46.525
the fields, and x percent of
the celery, of the potatoes

00:48:46.525 --> 00:48:48.900
are left, or the apple orchard,
and a whole lot of apples

00:48:48.900 --> 00:48:51.020
are left down,
volunteers can come in,

00:48:51.020 --> 00:48:53.760
and that food gets
into the system.

00:48:53.760 --> 00:48:57.280
I went to visit a food bank
in Israel's assistance called

00:48:57.280 --> 00:49:00.280
Leket Israel, and I was--
they have magnificent gleaning

00:49:00.280 --> 00:49:00.780
operations.

00:49:00.780 --> 00:49:03.290
It's the gold standard
for the world.

00:49:03.290 --> 00:49:06.670
And I was stunned.

00:49:06.670 --> 00:49:12.060
Nothing in that food
bank was processed food,

00:49:12.060 --> 00:49:12.990
with one exception.

00:49:12.990 --> 00:49:16.590
Israelis have this thing about
this thick chocolate spread.

00:49:16.590 --> 00:49:18.800
But everything else
was fresh produce

00:49:18.800 --> 00:49:21.425
that have been gleaned from
farms across the country.

00:49:21.425 --> 00:49:22.800
And that's getting
into a system.

00:49:22.800 --> 00:49:24.745
And we can and should
be doing it here.

00:49:24.745 --> 00:49:25.790
And gleaningharvest.org
is exactly where

00:49:25.790 --> 00:49:27.670
I want to get that
particular thing done.

00:49:27.670 --> 00:49:30.080
Did I answer your question?

00:49:30.080 --> 00:49:31.550
I want to make sure.

00:49:31.550 --> 00:49:32.960
OK.

00:49:32.960 --> 00:49:34.150
Is there another question?

00:49:34.150 --> 00:49:36.220
AUDIENCE: Yes.

00:49:36.220 --> 00:49:36.720
Hi.

00:49:36.720 --> 00:49:37.010
GARY OPPENHEIMER: HI.

00:49:37.010 --> 00:49:38.020
AUDIENCE: Thanks
for coming today.

00:49:38.020 --> 00:49:39.880
This is really
interesting to learn.

00:49:39.880 --> 00:49:41.692
GARY OPPENHEIMER: My
pleasure, thank you.

00:49:41.692 --> 00:49:43.400
AUDIENCE: You've
clearly done a great job

00:49:43.400 --> 00:49:47.360
of getting a lot of national
attention to your organization.

00:49:47.360 --> 00:49:50.260
And as someone who works with
nonprofit outside of work,

00:49:50.260 --> 00:49:54.050
I was wondering what's your
advice for, to do that?

00:49:54.050 --> 00:49:56.940
Did any of-- was it impacted
by the first lady's agenda?

00:49:56.940 --> 00:49:59.215
Do you think that helped?

00:49:59.215 --> 00:50:01.560
GARY OPPENHEIMER: [DEEP EXHALE]
That's a great question.

00:50:01.560 --> 00:50:03.790
I will tell you in all
honesty, one of the big things

00:50:03.790 --> 00:50:07.180
was believe it or
not, Google Alerts.

00:50:07.180 --> 00:50:09.250
I would have a flood
of those coming in,

00:50:09.250 --> 00:50:13.190
and I had pre-scanned
emails ready to go, back out

00:50:13.190 --> 00:50:16.510
to reporters, news
stations, whatever saying,

00:50:16.510 --> 00:50:17.920
great story on food pantries.

00:50:17.920 --> 00:50:18.960
Great story on hunger.

00:50:18.960 --> 00:50:21.861
Great story on this,
here's a site for followup,

00:50:21.861 --> 00:50:22.610
for another story.

00:50:22.610 --> 00:50:24.524
And we have a really
good online press kit.

00:50:24.524 --> 00:50:26.440
The funny thing about
the first lady's office,

00:50:26.440 --> 00:50:30.494
is that she rolled out Let's
Move! in, I think early 2010.

00:50:30.494 --> 00:50:32.160
And I wrote a letter
to the White House,

00:50:32.160 --> 00:50:33.800
saying I got this
great new program.

00:50:33.800 --> 00:50:35.290
We'd love to partner with you.

00:50:35.290 --> 00:50:39.300
And somebody wrote back and
said, thanks, but no thanks.

00:50:39.300 --> 00:50:39.811
Fine.

00:50:39.811 --> 00:50:40.310
No problem.

00:50:43.270 --> 00:50:44.762
Christmas time,
2011, my wife and I

00:50:44.762 --> 00:50:46.970
had the privilege of being
invited to the White House

00:50:46.970 --> 00:50:49.200
to meet the president
and first lady.

00:50:49.200 --> 00:50:51.876
So it was a thing of keep
at it, keep working at it.

00:50:51.876 --> 00:50:53.500
It was actually
connections, ultimately

00:50:53.500 --> 00:50:57.330
through the USDA, that got
us into the White House.

00:50:57.330 --> 00:51:00.830
We'd been going after
the Clinton Foundation.

00:51:00.830 --> 00:51:02.997
And we were getting pushed
back, pushed back, pushed

00:51:02.997 --> 00:51:03.496
Back.

00:51:03.496 --> 00:51:05.515
This past January, I was
with President Clinton,

00:51:05.515 --> 00:51:07.732
and AmpleHarvest.org
is a strategic partner

00:51:07.732 --> 00:51:10.190
of the Clinton Foundation--
the Clinton Foundation's Health

00:51:10.190 --> 00:51:11.360
Matter Initiative.

00:51:11.360 --> 00:51:12.410
You keep at it.

00:51:12.410 --> 00:51:15.210
And honestly, if you're
not succeeding here,

00:51:15.210 --> 00:51:17.600
just go another way.

00:51:17.600 --> 00:51:19.194
The heart of
AmpleHarvest.org actually

00:51:19.194 --> 00:51:21.360
is, when you hit a roadblock,
take a different path.

00:51:21.360 --> 00:51:23.902
Which is strangely enough, the
underpinnings of the internet.

00:51:23.902 --> 00:51:25.568
I mean, when you're
sending information,

00:51:25.568 --> 00:51:27.700
if this node is down,
route it around that node.

00:51:27.700 --> 00:51:29.120
It's not really any different.

00:51:29.120 --> 00:51:32.920
The other thing is, and this
is something that the man that

00:51:32.920 --> 00:51:36.060
Vint and I both, I guess worked
under at MCI-- his saying,

00:51:36.060 --> 00:51:38.265
which I've adopted, is
to do the impossible,

00:51:38.265 --> 00:51:40.310
you must first believe it isn't.

00:51:40.310 --> 00:51:41.684
His name is Bob [INAUDIBLE].

00:51:41.684 --> 00:51:43.850
I have an ashtray with that
on there, I treasure it.

00:51:43.850 --> 00:51:46.810
It's really, really
important that if you believe

00:51:46.810 --> 00:51:48.810
in something, whether
it's in the not for profit

00:51:48.810 --> 00:51:51.300
or the for-profit
world, stick to it.

00:51:51.300 --> 00:51:52.190
Be true to it.

00:51:52.190 --> 00:51:55.520
If it's the right
thing, it'll happen.

00:51:55.520 --> 00:51:58.286
It may not happen as big or
as gloriously as you wanted.

00:51:58.286 --> 00:52:00.660
In my case, this happened far
bigger, and more gloriously

00:52:00.660 --> 00:52:01.900
than I had ever expected.

00:52:01.900 --> 00:52:03.960
I mean, I'm an aging geek.

00:52:03.960 --> 00:52:06.080
I have no background
in the nonprofit world.

00:52:06.080 --> 00:52:10.710
And I'm at a point now
where I'm talking to you.

00:52:10.710 --> 00:52:11.954
I've met two presidents.

00:52:11.954 --> 00:52:13.620
I go around the country
giving speeches.

00:52:13.620 --> 00:52:15.119
There's been a long
litany of things

00:52:15.119 --> 00:52:18.450
that six years ago, I
would've never expected.

00:52:18.450 --> 00:52:24.630
The thing to do is also to
[DEEP EXHALE] find people

00:52:24.630 --> 00:52:27.670
who believe the
same thing you do.

00:52:27.670 --> 00:52:30.214
Invite them, partner
like crazy, by the way.

00:52:30.214 --> 00:52:31.130
Stick to your mission.

00:52:31.130 --> 00:52:32.080
That's super critical.

00:52:32.080 --> 00:52:33.250
There's something
called mission creep.

00:52:33.250 --> 00:52:34.630
Never go down that path.

00:52:34.630 --> 00:52:37.270
If you believe-- if your mission
is to do this, stick to it,

00:52:37.270 --> 00:52:38.860
and find partners
to do nearby things.

00:52:38.860 --> 00:52:40.960
But don't drift
into their stuff.

00:52:40.960 --> 00:52:41.660
We've done that.

00:52:41.660 --> 00:52:44.070
We don't help people get food.

00:52:44.070 --> 00:52:47.130
We go to WhyHunger or National
Hunger Hotline, or United Way.

00:52:47.130 --> 00:52:48.440
That's their job.

00:52:48.440 --> 00:52:50.370
We don't tell
people how to grow.

00:52:50.370 --> 00:52:53.610
National Gardening Association
does a great job, as do others.

00:52:53.610 --> 00:52:57.480
We are that connector between
the food in the community,

00:52:57.480 --> 00:52:59.060
and the need in the community.

00:52:59.060 --> 00:53:00.810
And we're educating,
encouraging,

00:53:00.810 --> 00:53:03.390
and enabling millions
of growers to donate.

00:53:03.390 --> 00:53:05.880
By the result of doing
that-- I hate the expression,

00:53:05.880 --> 00:53:08.950
but we own the
space that were in.

00:53:08.950 --> 00:53:10.540
People are using
us as a resource

00:53:10.540 --> 00:53:12.000
to do their different
things, which is great.

00:53:12.000 --> 00:53:13.760
There's a new student
group in Florida

00:53:13.760 --> 00:53:14.920
that's doing a food
recovery thing,

00:53:14.920 --> 00:53:16.836
and they're using
AmpleHarvest.org's resources

00:53:16.836 --> 00:53:18.170
to help them do their stuff.

00:53:18.170 --> 00:53:19.904
And our model is now
with our systems,

00:53:19.904 --> 00:53:21.320
being replicated
around the world.

00:53:21.320 --> 00:53:25.530
I've met with people in--
well, I shouldn't say in.

00:53:25.530 --> 00:53:27.060
I've been to Greece and Israel.

00:53:27.060 --> 00:53:29.970
But all this I've either
emailed, Skype or whatever,

00:53:29.970 --> 00:53:34.860
England, Poland, the UK, South
Africa, Japan, New Zealand,

00:53:34.860 --> 00:53:37.400
Australia, I missing a few.

00:53:37.400 --> 00:53:40.140
And we're making this
information freely available.

00:53:40.140 --> 00:53:42.680
This is how it
works, in America.

00:53:42.680 --> 00:53:45.430
Make it work in your system,
in your language, your culture,

00:53:45.430 --> 00:53:47.580
whatever, in your country.

00:53:47.580 --> 00:53:49.719
The food waste issue is
not an American problem.

00:53:49.719 --> 00:53:51.760
I like the way Tristram
Stuart brilliantly shows,

00:53:51.760 --> 00:53:53.440
it is a global problem.

00:53:53.440 --> 00:53:56.060
But there's also a
global opportunity.

00:53:56.060 --> 00:53:58.750
We've got a model
that was perfectly fit

00:53:58.750 --> 00:54:00.800
for the American food
distribution network.

00:54:00.800 --> 00:54:01.780
It was built for that.

00:54:04.810 --> 00:54:07.590
And also, one other thing, and
I should've said this earlier,

00:54:07.590 --> 00:54:09.690
so I'm going to say it now.

00:54:09.690 --> 00:54:12.624
Think about other areas where
you can influence things,

00:54:12.624 --> 00:54:14.040
in the work you're
doing, that you

00:54:14.040 --> 00:54:15.020
wouldn't have thought about.

00:54:15.020 --> 00:54:17.240
I built AmpleHarvest.org
with something called 'just

00:54:17.240 --> 00:54:18.890
in time' inventory.

00:54:18.890 --> 00:54:20.724
And in manufacturing,
just in time inventory

00:54:20.724 --> 00:54:23.223
is something-- having pieces
arrive just when you need them.

00:54:23.223 --> 00:54:24.720
When Boeing's
making an airplane,

00:54:24.720 --> 00:54:26.200
they have the wings
arrive just when it's

00:54:26.200 --> 00:54:27.410
ready to be attached
to the fuselage.

00:54:27.410 --> 00:54:28.840
It's not sitting on the side.

00:54:28.840 --> 00:54:32.090
So things come just in time.

00:54:32.090 --> 00:54:34.710
AmpleHarvest.org harvest
was built in a way in which,

00:54:34.710 --> 00:54:39.180
we tell the pantries to tell
the growers when to come.

00:54:39.180 --> 00:54:40.870
And by the way, this
one little speck

00:54:40.870 --> 00:54:42.710
changes a whole bunch of things.

00:54:42.710 --> 00:54:44.460
We told the pantries,
tell the growers

00:54:44.460 --> 00:54:46.600
to come an hour or two
before the clients come

00:54:46.600 --> 00:54:48.240
to pick up the food.

00:54:48.240 --> 00:54:50.040
Now what happens as
a result of that?

00:54:50.040 --> 00:54:53.990
Well, number one is the food
comes in, stays a few hours,

00:54:53.990 --> 00:54:54.630
and goes out.

00:54:54.630 --> 00:54:56.800
We've eliminated the need for
refrigeration and storage.

00:54:56.800 --> 00:54:58.450
That was a huge
impediment for pantries

00:54:58.450 --> 00:54:59.880
nationwide to take fresh food.

00:54:59.880 --> 00:55:01.050
We have no place to store
it, we have no place

00:55:01.050 --> 00:55:01.830
to refrigerate it.

00:55:01.830 --> 00:55:05.030
In, out same day basis,
no refrigeration.

00:55:05.030 --> 00:55:07.010
But there's an ethical
component to it too.

00:55:07.010 --> 00:55:09.750
In our society,
it's entirely likely

00:55:09.750 --> 00:55:11.647
that I'm growing more
food than I can use,

00:55:11.647 --> 00:55:14.230
and you're my next door neighbor
who has fallen on hard times.

00:55:14.230 --> 00:55:15.660
And you're going
to a food pantry,

00:55:15.660 --> 00:55:17.249
you're kind of
humiliated as it is.

00:55:17.249 --> 00:55:19.540
You wish you could take care
of your own family better,

00:55:19.540 --> 00:55:20.440
and you didn't need
to use a pantry.

00:55:20.440 --> 00:55:22.370
You shouldn't feel
that way, but you do.

00:55:22.370 --> 00:55:24.120
The worst thing is for
me to be showing up

00:55:24.120 --> 00:55:26.660
with my basket of
food, you showing up

00:55:26.660 --> 00:55:28.680
to pick up your thing,
and I'm embarrassed,

00:55:28.680 --> 00:55:30.150
and you're humiliated.

00:55:30.150 --> 00:55:33.610
By separating by time,
I'm coming in a few hours

00:55:33.610 --> 00:55:35.690
before you, I know it's
going to my community,

00:55:35.690 --> 00:55:36.929
but I don't know who.

00:55:36.929 --> 00:55:38.470
You know it came
from your community,

00:55:38.470 --> 00:55:40.360
but you don't know who.

00:55:40.360 --> 00:55:42.770
The ethics in that's
really, really important.

00:55:42.770 --> 00:55:45.830
The food moves, they use
no refrigeration, storage,

00:55:45.830 --> 00:55:49.710
and our relationship has
nothing to this whole thing.

00:55:49.710 --> 00:55:51.320
You can find other ways to make.

00:55:51.320 --> 00:55:53.870
And those things alone
excite other people.

00:55:53.870 --> 00:55:57.780
That gets people informed--
wow, I can do these things too.

00:55:57.780 --> 00:56:00.170
And the last thing I would
say is, share your knowledge.

00:56:00.170 --> 00:56:03.100
I love talking at universities.

00:56:03.100 --> 00:56:05.240
Not because I like to
talk, although I do.

00:56:05.240 --> 00:56:06.590
It's because I like to listen.

00:56:06.590 --> 00:56:09.080
And the students come back to
me, some really great ideas

00:56:09.080 --> 00:56:10.538
and really, really
great questions.

00:56:10.538 --> 00:56:13.049
And some of them have
jazzed up things,

00:56:13.049 --> 00:56:14.840
and we've added things
on AmpleHarvest.org.

00:56:14.840 --> 00:56:17.240
Somebody came to us with an
idea that we never thought

00:56:17.240 --> 00:56:19.690
about, and fits, and we do it.

00:56:19.690 --> 00:56:20.730
So share the knowledge.

00:56:20.730 --> 00:56:21.440
Share the information.

00:56:21.440 --> 00:56:22.350
Share your successes.

00:56:22.350 --> 00:56:23.680
Share your failures.

00:56:23.680 --> 00:56:25.600
And I'm happy to
talk you further

00:56:25.600 --> 00:56:29.822
about it, if you want--
whatever your endeavors is.

00:56:29.822 --> 00:56:30.530
AUDIENCE: Thanks.

00:56:30.530 --> 00:56:31.730
GARY OPPENHEIMER: Thank you.

00:56:31.730 --> 00:56:35.980
[APPLAUSE]
