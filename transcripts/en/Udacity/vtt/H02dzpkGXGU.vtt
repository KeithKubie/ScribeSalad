00:00:00.570 --> 00:00:05.630
Let's look at the computation pipeline for a Video Analytics application. Let's

00:00:05.630 --> 00:00:09.840
say I'm interested in detecting and tracking some anomalous

00:00:09.840 --> 00:00:15.220
event. So I have cameras, which captures the images from a particular

00:00:15.220 --> 00:00:20.340
environment. And you're detecting for something specific.

00:00:20.340 --> 00:00:25.720
Maybe you're looking for [INAUDIBLE] in every camera frame, and once

00:00:25.720 --> 00:00:28.230
you detect, it shows face then you say

00:00:28.230 --> 00:00:30.930
it what? This guy is a suspicious individual, let's

00:00:30.930 --> 00:00:32.740
track him as he moves around. So, the

00:00:32.740 --> 00:00:37.710
tracking is taking a particular object of interest for

00:00:37.710 --> 00:00:41.970
the domain and asking the question What is

00:00:41.970 --> 00:00:44.930
happening to that object as time moves on. And

00:00:44.930 --> 00:00:48.490
in the process of tracking, you are recognizing who

00:00:48.490 --> 00:00:51.570
that person is. If there are multiple people in

00:00:51.570 --> 00:00:55.780
a particular alignment, your recognizing the specific

00:00:55.780 --> 00:00:58.400
individual that you may be interested in.

00:00:58.400 --> 00:01:01.910
And if that individual is recognized, then

00:01:01.910 --> 00:01:04.530
perhaps you want to raise an alarm. So, this

00:01:04.530 --> 00:01:10.480
is just a simple pipeline of tasks to illustrate what a domain expert may be

00:01:10.480 --> 00:01:17.310
doing in a video analytics application. So such a domain expert is an expert in

00:01:17.310 --> 00:01:21.900
writing detection algorithms, tracking algorithms, and. Recognition

00:01:21.900 --> 00:01:27.100
algorithms so that they can process the video stream in

00:01:27.100 --> 00:01:32.310
real time to generate alarms. So the objective in Situation

00:01:32.310 --> 00:01:37.980
Awareness applications is to process these streams of data

00:01:37.980 --> 00:01:42.800
for high level inference. In other words, we're not watching a

00:01:42.800 --> 00:01:47.550
YouTube video, but we're using the sensor

00:01:47.550 --> 00:01:51.440
streams to derive high level inferences to

00:01:51.440 --> 00:01:56.070
what is happening in the enlighnment. And that's what is the nature of Situation

00:01:56.070 --> 00:02:00.270
Awareness applications. As I mentioned Video Analytics

00:02:00.270 --> 00:02:02.400
is in the purview of a domain

00:02:02.400 --> 00:02:04.830
expert like a vision researcher or a

00:02:04.830 --> 00:02:08.080
developer, who knows how to write sophisticated

00:02:08.080 --> 00:02:11.480
detection, tracking, and recognition algorithms. But how

00:02:11.480 --> 00:02:13.430
do we scale that up to thousands of

00:02:13.430 --> 00:02:16.830
cameras? If an object is moving from one

00:02:16.830 --> 00:02:19.170
camera to another, these are the kinds of

00:02:19.170 --> 00:02:23.360
things that the domain expert. For Situation

00:02:23.360 --> 00:02:25.610
Awareness may have to worry about, this is

00:02:25.610 --> 00:02:29.420
where systems can come in with programming models

00:02:29.420 --> 00:02:33.290
that alleviate the pain points of a domain

00:02:33.290 --> 00:02:38.480
expert developing Situation Awareness applications. Persistent temporal

00:02:38.480 --> 00:02:41.510
streams, which is the focal point of

00:02:41.510 --> 00:02:45.460
this particular lesson. Is just one exemplar

00:02:45.460 --> 00:02:48.260
of a distributed programming system for catering

00:02:48.260 --> 00:02:54.280
to the needs of situation awareness applications. Such as, what I described

00:02:54.280 --> 00:02:58.290
to you, just now. I want to stress the fact that PTS is just an exemplar,

00:02:58.290 --> 00:03:03.510
not the last word. But it is good to look at one concrete example of

00:03:03.510 --> 00:03:06.950
a distributive programming system that can help reduce

00:03:06.950 --> 00:03:10.630
the pain points in developing Situational Awareness Applications.
