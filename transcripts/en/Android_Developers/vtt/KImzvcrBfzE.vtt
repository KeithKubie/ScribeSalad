MARC TOBIAS KUNISCH:
Android Instant Apps

00:00:01.708 --> 00:00:04.450
make it possible for users to
access your app without having

00:00:04.450 --> 00:00:06.100
to install it first.

00:00:06.100 --> 00:00:08.109
Imagine users
opening your app just

00:00:08.109 --> 00:00:11.820
by clicking on a link in
an email or a text message.

00:00:11.820 --> 00:00:13.710
We've recently made
Android Instant Apps

00:00:13.710 --> 00:00:16.320
available to all
Android developers.

00:00:16.320 --> 00:00:19.170
To take full advantage of this,
we have some best practices

00:00:19.170 --> 00:00:20.880
to help you make your
Instant Apps user

00:00:20.880 --> 00:00:23.920
experience as great as
that in your installed app,

00:00:23.920 --> 00:00:25.520
or maybe even better.

00:00:25.520 --> 00:00:28.020
You can find all this and more
at the URL in the description

00:00:28.020 --> 00:00:29.250
below.

00:00:29.250 --> 00:00:31.710
It's important to keep in
mind that by enabling your app

00:00:31.710 --> 00:00:34.320
to run instantly
without installation,

00:00:34.320 --> 00:00:36.496
you're not creating
another additional app.

00:00:36.496 --> 00:00:38.370
We're thinking of Instant
Apps as another way

00:00:38.370 --> 00:00:41.130
to use the app your users
already know and love.

00:00:41.130 --> 00:00:44.900
It's the same app, just
without installation.

00:00:44.900 --> 00:00:47.360
By adding the ability to
access your app directly

00:00:47.360 --> 00:00:50.090
from a link, a search
result, or another app,

00:00:50.090 --> 00:00:52.520
it's much easier for users
to engage with your app

00:00:52.520 --> 00:00:54.590
and get excited about it.

00:00:54.590 --> 00:00:57.500
If they decide to keep your app
on their device permanently,

00:00:57.500 --> 00:01:01.600
they can then install it right
from within the Instant App.

00:01:01.600 --> 00:01:04.390
The ability to launch an app
without having to install it

00:01:04.390 --> 00:01:06.520
provides an enormous
opportunity.

00:01:06.520 --> 00:01:08.420
For a long time,
app developers have

00:01:08.420 --> 00:01:10.600
focused on the number
of app installations

00:01:10.600 --> 00:01:14.110
as a proxy for the metrics their
business really cares about.

00:01:14.110 --> 00:01:15.700
Without installation,
users simply

00:01:15.700 --> 00:01:19.120
weren't able to engage with the
developers' offerings at all.

00:01:19.120 --> 00:01:21.496
Removing this barrier
to entry enables

00:01:21.496 --> 00:01:23.620
you to think about the
metrics your business really

00:01:23.620 --> 00:01:24.640
cares about.

00:01:24.640 --> 00:01:27.460
Your audience is now just
one tap away from engaging

00:01:27.460 --> 00:01:29.580
with your service.

00:01:29.580 --> 00:01:32.530
Your Instant App is just another
mode your app can run in,

00:01:32.530 --> 00:01:37.000
so don't branch your UI and
make any unnecessary changes

00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:40.150
regarding the layout,
interface, design, or experience

00:01:40.150 --> 00:01:41.680
of your Instant App.

00:01:41.680 --> 00:01:44.470
The transition from
instant to installed mode

00:01:44.470 --> 00:01:47.140
after installation should
be as smooth and seamless

00:01:47.140 --> 00:01:49.390
as possible.

00:01:49.390 --> 00:01:52.450
Your users should have a
rich and full app experience,

00:01:52.450 --> 00:01:54.700
even if they haven't
installed your app.

00:01:54.700 --> 00:01:57.610
Rather than thinking of Instant
Apps as a limiting factor

00:01:57.610 --> 00:01:59.830
to what your audience
can do, think of it

00:01:59.830 --> 00:02:02.980
as an opportunity to get them
to your functionality quicker

00:02:02.980 --> 00:02:06.350
and a way to foster your
relationship with them.

00:02:06.350 --> 00:02:09.380
Avoid prompting your users to
install the app when they're

00:02:09.380 --> 00:02:11.120
in the middle of a task.

00:02:11.120 --> 00:02:13.160
They'll be much more
inclined to place your app

00:02:13.160 --> 00:02:15.750
onto their device
permanently after it

00:02:15.750 --> 00:02:19.340
has had the opportunity
to prove its usefulness.

00:02:19.340 --> 00:02:21.440
Refrain from bouncing
them back and forth

00:02:21.440 --> 00:02:24.470
between your Instant App and
your mobile web offerings.

00:02:24.470 --> 00:02:27.260
You can probably tell
by now Instant Apps

00:02:27.260 --> 00:02:29.660
are all about removing
friction for your users

00:02:29.660 --> 00:02:32.000
and getting them closer
to your functionality.

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:34.580
Think about ways you can
remove further barriers

00:02:34.580 --> 00:02:35.960
for your users.

00:02:35.960 --> 00:02:38.240
For example, wait
until users can

00:02:38.240 --> 00:02:40.220
see the benefit of
making an account

00:02:40.220 --> 00:02:43.940
and signing in until the value
of doing so becomes apparent.

00:02:43.940 --> 00:02:46.460
Asking users to create an
account after installation

00:02:46.460 --> 00:02:48.650
seems like a small
additional ask

00:02:48.650 --> 00:02:50.900
when they've already gone
through the app installation

00:02:50.900 --> 00:02:53.299
flow and are only
just getting started.

00:02:53.299 --> 00:02:55.340
However, when they are
coming from a link looking

00:02:55.340 --> 00:02:57.710
for specific content
or functionality,

00:02:57.710 --> 00:03:01.290
being asked to register
can feel very disruptive.

00:03:01.290 --> 00:03:04.200
Additionally, make sure
to use available APIs

00:03:04.200 --> 00:03:07.260
to make your and your
user's life easier.

00:03:07.260 --> 00:03:09.250
Using Google's Smart
Lock, for example,

00:03:09.250 --> 00:03:11.490
makes signing up and
signing in a much simpler

00:03:11.490 --> 00:03:14.350
and straightforward experience.

00:03:14.350 --> 00:03:16.690
In summary, we really
think that Instant Apps

00:03:16.690 --> 00:03:19.660
will unlock a lot of opportunity
to engage your audience more

00:03:19.660 --> 00:03:20.980
directly.

00:03:20.980 --> 00:03:22.690
Users will be able
to focus on what

00:03:22.690 --> 00:03:24.430
it is they want to
accomplish, rather

00:03:24.430 --> 00:03:27.010
than having to spend time
maintaining and updating apps

00:03:27.010 --> 00:03:28.540
on their phone.

00:03:28.540 --> 00:03:31.800
We're super excited to
see what you come up with.

00:03:31.800 --> 00:03:33.930
Everything I talked about
here, and much more,

00:03:33.930 --> 00:03:37.140
you can find on
g.co/instantapps.

00:03:37.140 --> 00:03:38.990
Thanks for watching.
