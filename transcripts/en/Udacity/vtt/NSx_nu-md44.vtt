00:00:00.450 --> 00:00:01.270
Alright. So what do you think?

00:00:01.270 --> 00:00:04.910
&gt;&gt; I think the answer is, three. It sometimes

00:00:04.910 --> 00:00:07.500
would be left and sometimes would be right, depending upon

00:00:07.500 --> 00:00:10.340
where you randomly start. So for example if you

00:00:10.340 --> 00:00:12.990
start with your random centers on a and b. Then

00:00:12.990 --> 00:00:15.390
I think what'll happen is, d will end up

00:00:15.390 --> 00:00:19.700
on the right, as that point gets dragged over towards

00:00:19.700 --> 00:00:21.700
the weight of the right, it'll drag d with it.

00:00:21.700 --> 00:00:25.500
If you started out with both points on f and

00:00:25.500 --> 00:00:28.240
g, then I think d would get dragged to the

00:00:28.240 --> 00:00:31.650
left cluster as the left most cluster got dragged to the

00:00:31.650 --> 00:00:34.960
left. I think if you started it with a and

00:00:34.960 --> 00:00:38.700
g, then it would depend upon how you break ties. And

00:00:38.700 --> 00:00:41.500
since I always break ties lexiographically, because I like saying

00:00:41.500 --> 00:00:44.190
the word lexiographically, it would end up on the left. So

00:00:44.190 --> 00:00:47.340
I think the answer has to be the third choice. But,

00:00:47.340 --> 00:00:49.920
I'll say one thing, I wish it were the fourth choice.

00:00:50.980 --> 00:00:53.770
&gt;&gt; I would like to grant this wish by talking about the

00:00:53.770 --> 00:00:55.950
next clustering algorithm which, in particular,

00:00:55.950 --> 00:00:58.290
does soft clustering. And, soft clustering

00:00:58.290 --> 00:01:02.390
allows for the possibility that a point can be shared you know,

00:01:02.390 --> 00:01:03.930
I'm a little bit of this, I'm a little bit of that.

00:01:06.580 --> 00:01:08.103
I'm a little bit of country, I'm a little bit of rock and roll.
