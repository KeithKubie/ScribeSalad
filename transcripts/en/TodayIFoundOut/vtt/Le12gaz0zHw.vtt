00:00:00.290 --> 00:00:04.130
Hello I’m Daven Hiskey, you’re watching
the TodayIFoundOut youtube channel, in the

00:00:04.130 --> 00:00:07.950
video today, we’re looking at why Take Me
Out to the Ballgame is sung during the 7th

00:00:07.950 --> 00:00:12.650
inning stretch of major league baseball games
and when the practice of a 7th inning stretch

00:00:12.650 --> 00:00:14.360
got started.

00:00:14.360 --> 00:00:17.860
Just before we get started today, I’d like
to call your attention to a relatively new

00:00:17.860 --> 00:00:20.880
channel by one of our most prolific authors,
Karl Smallwood.

00:00:20.880 --> 00:00:25.350
Karl’s new channel, linked in the description
below, is called FactFiend and is essentially

00:00:25.350 --> 00:00:29.480
an interesting fact channel, but in a quite
different style than we do here, or really

00:00:29.480 --> 00:00:31.600
anyone does as far as I’m aware.

00:00:31.600 --> 00:00:34.750
Please do check his channel out and if you
like it don’t forget to subscribe.

00:00:34.750 --> 00:00:41.090
And now without further ado, our video on
Take Me Out to the Ballgame.

00:00:41.090 --> 00:00:44.890
You might be surprised to learn that this
staple of Major League Baseball games is actually

00:00:44.890 --> 00:00:49.560
something of a modern practice, first starting
as a regular part of the seventh inning stretch

00:00:49.560 --> 00:00:55.370
with the White Sox in the late 1970s, thanks
to Hall of Fame broadcaster Harry Carabina,

00:00:55.370 --> 00:00:57.120
better known as Harry Caray.

00:00:57.120 --> 00:01:01.230
Before this, the song had occasionally been
sung by fans at various baseball games (both

00:01:01.230 --> 00:01:06.530
amateur and in the Major Leagues), but never
as a regular thing nor at any designated time.

00:01:06.530 --> 00:01:11.010
The first known instance of this was at a
Los Angeles high school game in 1934.

00:01:11.010 --> 00:01:16.180
It was also played before one of the games
in the 1934 World Series when Pepper Martin

00:01:16.180 --> 00:01:18.580
and the St. Louis Cardinals Band played it.

00:01:18.580 --> 00:01:23.590
Harry Caray started singing the song during
the seventh inning stretch in 1971, with fans

00:01:23.590 --> 00:01:26.520
within earshot of his booth occasionally joining
in.

00:01:26.520 --> 00:01:30.229
There are conflicting accounts from those
involved (including a story that changed over

00:01:30.229 --> 00:01:35.720
time from then owner, Bill Veeck) as to how
this event transitioned to a White Sox tradition.

00:01:35.720 --> 00:01:40.880
In one account, after Caray refused to sing
over the stadium PA system, Veeck tricked

00:01:40.880 --> 00:01:44.189
Caray by switching on Caray’s microphone
while he was singing.

00:01:44.189 --> 00:01:47.880
Probably, the more likely tale is another
first-hand account that it was all planned

00:01:47.880 --> 00:01:48.880
out ahead of time.

00:01:48.880 --> 00:01:53.150
But that’s not nearly as entertaining, so
one can see why the colorful Bill Veeck might

00:01:53.150 --> 00:01:54.950
embellish the story a little.

00:01:54.950 --> 00:01:59.810
Whatever the case, in 1976, Caray started
singing the song over the stadium PA system

00:01:59.810 --> 00:02:01.689
and it became a local tradition.

00:02:01.689 --> 00:02:06.689
When Caray switched to calling games for the
Cubs in 1982, he brought this tradition with

00:02:06.689 --> 00:02:07.689
him.

00:02:07.689 --> 00:02:11.599
Thanks to the fact that WGN broadcasted the
Cubs games nationally, the masses quickly

00:02:11.599 --> 00:02:14.169
learned of Harry Caray’s seventh inning
tradition.

00:02:14.169 --> 00:02:18.879
Shortly thereafter, variations on this tradition
were adopted at other stadiums, with the song

00:02:18.879 --> 00:02:21.689
in question varying from team to team.

00:02:21.689 --> 00:02:25.459
In the end, all teams went ahead and went
with Take Me Out to the Ballgame.

00:02:25.459 --> 00:02:28.489
Despite the fact that singing Take Me Out
to the Ballgame during the seventh inning

00:02:28.489 --> 00:02:33.120
stretch is a modern practice, the song itself,
about a girl named Katie Case who wants her

00:02:33.120 --> 00:02:37.989
boyfriend to take her to a baseball game,
has been around since 1908 when it was written

00:02:37.989 --> 00:02:44.209
by famed song writer Jack Norworth (who wrote
over 2,500 songs in his lifetime, including

00:02:44.209 --> 00:02:47.269
a couple dozen that sold more than a million
copies each).

00:02:47.269 --> 00:02:50.029
The music was composed by Albert Von Tilzer.

00:02:50.029 --> 00:02:54.609
Funny enough, both of these gentlemen had
never actually been to a professional baseball

00:02:54.609 --> 00:02:56.799
game when they created the song.

00:02:56.799 --> 00:03:02.129
Norworth claimed the first Major League Baseball
game he ever went to wasn’t until June 27,

00:03:02.129 --> 00:03:04.739
1940, a Dodgers / Cubs game.

00:03:04.739 --> 00:03:08.449
So what inspired this non-baseball fan to
write a baseball song?

00:03:08.449 --> 00:03:12.931
While riding a train to Manhattan, Norworth
said he saw a sign that said “Baseball Today

00:03:12.931 --> 00:03:17.919
– Polo Grounds” and simply decided to
write a song about going to a baseball game,

00:03:17.919 --> 00:03:20.169
so he scribbled it down during his ride.

00:03:20.169 --> 00:03:24.099
Once the song was complete, Norworth’s wife,
singer-actress Nora Bayes, was the first to

00:03:24.099 --> 00:03:25.310
sing it publicly.

00:03:25.310 --> 00:03:29.680
It quickly became a hit at various vaudeville
acts and then beyond, becoming one of the

00:03:29.680 --> 00:03:32.109
most popular songs of 1908.

00:03:32.109 --> 00:03:33.109
BONUS FACT

00:03:33.109 --> 00:03:36.730
You’ll often read that the seventh inning
stretch tradition in baseball was thanks to

00:03:36.730 --> 00:03:39.629
President William Howard Taft in 1910.

00:03:39.629 --> 00:03:43.370
The general story goes that the extremely
overweight President, after throwing out the

00:03:43.370 --> 00:03:48.930
first pitch on April 14, 1910, in a game between
the Washington Senators and the Philadelphia

00:03:48.930 --> 00:03:53.559
Athletics, was uncomfortable sitting in the
small stadium seating and by the seventh inning

00:03:53.559 --> 00:03:55.749
needed to stretch, so he stood up.

00:03:55.749 --> 00:04:00.290
When he did this, those in attendance noticed
and everyone else stood up out of respect

00:04:00.290 --> 00:04:03.989
until Taft finally sat back down after thoroughly
stretching.

00:04:03.989 --> 00:04:07.599
Whether this actually happened or not, we
do know that this was not the origin of the

00:04:07.599 --> 00:04:08.849
seventh inning stretch.

00:04:08.849 --> 00:04:12.400
The first recorded instance of the seventh
inning stretch goes all the way back to the

00:04:12.400 --> 00:04:17.670
earliest days of professional baseball in
1869, where Harry Wright, who played for the

00:04:17.670 --> 00:04:22.200
Cincinnati Red Stockings at the time, wrote
in a letter, “The spectators all arise between

00:04:22.200 --> 00:04:26.820
halves of the seventh inning, extend their
legs and arms, and sometimes walk about.

00:04:26.820 --> 00:04:31.820
In so doing, they enjoy the relief afforded
by relaxation from a long posture upon hard

00:04:31.820 --> 00:04:32.820
benches.”

00:04:32.820 --> 00:04:36.070
There are also other documented instances
of the practice of the seventh inning stretch

00:04:36.070 --> 00:04:39.340
in both professional and amateur games before
Taft.

00:04:39.340 --> 00:04:43.590
So while it’s true that Taft did indeed
throw out the first pitch of the game in question,

00:04:43.590 --> 00:04:47.600
and given the seventh inning stretch was already
around, I’m even willing to buy that he

00:04:47.600 --> 00:04:49.700
stood up and stretched at the appointed time.

00:04:49.700 --> 00:04:54.750
But, it would seem the reason the masses stood
too was simply because this was already an

00:04:54.750 --> 00:04:56.320
established practice.

00:04:56.320 --> 00:04:59.560
That being said, it wasn’t specifically
called the “seventh-inning stretch” until

00:04:59.560 --> 00:05:00.560
the 1920s.
