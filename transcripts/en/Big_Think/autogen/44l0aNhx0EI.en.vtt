this pushes up the price of food and so

00:01:09.910 --> 00:01:09.920
this pushes up the price of food and so
 

00:01:09.920 --> 00:01:12.350
this pushes up the price of food and so
there's been a great interest in the

very interested in aquatic plants as a

00:01:23.929 --> 00:01:23.939
very interested in aquatic plants as a
 

00:01:23.939 --> 00:01:26.780
very interested in aquatic plants as a
possibility here and one of the most

00:01:26.780 --> 00:01:26.790
possibility here and one of the most
 

00:01:26.790 --> 00:01:29.030

point of view is common duck weed the

00:01:31.340 --> 00:01:31.350
point of view is common duck weed the
 

00:01:31.350 --> 00:01:32.569
point of view is common duck weed the
reason for this is that duck weed

00:01:32.569 --> 00:01:32.579
reason for this is that duck weed
 

00:01:32.579 --> 00:01:35.480
reason for this is that duck weed
doubles in biomass every 48 hours

00:01:35.480 --> 00:01:35.490
doubles in biomass every 48 hours
 

00:01:35.490 --> 00:01:38.420
doubles in biomass every 48 hours
sometimes even less and as a result it

00:01:38.420 --> 00:01:38.430
sometimes even less and as a result it
 

00:01:38.430 --> 00:01:41.870
sometimes even less and as a result it
has the highest per hectare increase in

00:01:41.870 --> 00:01:41.880
has the highest per hectare increase in
 

00:01:41.880 --> 00:01:44.749
has the highest per hectare increase in
biomass of any plant even though it's a

does anyone who who has a pond will know

00:01:52.550 --> 00:01:52.560
does anyone who who has a pond will know
 

00:01:52.560 --> 00:01:55.249
does anyone who who has a pond will know
especially if that pond is for example

00:01:55.249 --> 00:01:55.259
especially if that pond is for example
 

00:01:55.259 --> 00:01:56.660
especially if that pond is for example
on a golf course or something like that

00:01:56.660 --> 00:01:56.670
on a golf course or something like that
 

00:01:56.670 --> 00:01:58.550

where there's a lot of fertilizer put

00:01:58.550 --> 00:01:58.560
where there's a lot of fertilizer put
 

00:01:58.560 --> 00:02:00.020
where there's a lot of fertilizer put
into the ground the fertilizer will run

00:02:00.020 --> 00:02:00.030
into the ground the fertilizer will run
 

00:02:00.030 --> 00:02:02.719

into much cleaner water

00:02:13.640 --> 00:02:13.650
into much cleaner water
 

00:02:13.650 --> 00:02:15.259

and at the same time massively increase

00:02:15.259 --> 00:02:15.269
and at the same time massively increase
 

00:02:15.269 --> 00:02:18.199
and at the same time massively increase
in biomass so we're interested in using

00:02:18.199 --> 00:02:18.209
in biomass so we're interested in using
 

00:02:18.209 --> 00:02:22.490
in biomass so we're interested in using

which you've never imagined crops would

00:02:30.199 --> 00:02:30.209
which you've never imagined crops would
 

00:02:30.209 --> 00:02:32.289

we're taking we're taking a lesson from

00:02:35.030 --> 00:02:35.040
we're taking we're taking a lesson from
 

00:02:35.040 --> 00:02:37.789
we're taking we're taking a lesson from
the another very popular biofuel which

00:02:37.789 --> 00:02:37.799
the another very popular biofuel which
 

00:02:37.799 --> 00:02:40.929
the another very popular biofuel which
is algae green algae so a green algae

00:02:40.929 --> 00:02:40.939
is algae green algae so a green algae
 

00:02:40.939 --> 00:02:44.660
is algae green algae so a green algae
have the ability again to grow in water

00:02:44.660 --> 00:02:44.670
have the ability again to grow in water
 

00:02:44.670 --> 00:02:47.660
have the ability again to grow in water
and at very high rates but they also

00:02:47.660 --> 00:02:47.670
and at very high rates but they also
 

00:02:47.670 --> 00:02:50.830
and at very high rates but they also
have the ability to make oil directly

00:02:50.830 --> 00:02:50.840
have the ability to make oil directly
 

00:02:50.840 --> 00:02:53.599
have the ability to make oil directly
and this has been very exciting in the

00:02:53.599 --> 00:02:53.609
and this has been very exciting in the
 

00:02:53.609 --> 00:02:55.879
and this has been very exciting in the
in the biofuels community however it's

00:02:55.879 --> 00:02:55.889
in the biofuels community however it's
 

00:02:55.889 --> 00:02:58.580
in the biofuels community however it's
still energetically is not efficient to

00:02:58.580 --> 00:02:58.590
still energetically is not efficient to
 

00:02:58.590 --> 00:03:00.589
still energetically is not efficient to
make oil from algae you put more energy

00:03:00.589 --> 00:03:00.599
make oil from algae you put more energy
 

00:03:00.599 --> 00:03:04.009
make oil from algae you put more energy
in mostly from artificial light and and

00:03:04.009 --> 00:03:04.019
in mostly from artificial light and and
 

00:03:04.019 --> 00:03:06.710
in mostly from artificial light and and
and keeping things sterile and and so on

00:03:06.710 --> 00:03:06.720
and keeping things sterile and and so on
 

00:03:06.720 --> 00:03:09.949
and keeping things sterile and and so on
then you get out in the form of oil now

00:03:09.949 --> 00:03:09.959
then you get out in the form of oil now
 

00:03:09.959 --> 00:03:12.020
then you get out in the form of oil now
duckweed is much more robust organism

00:03:12.020 --> 00:03:12.030
duckweed is much more robust organism
 

00:03:12.030 --> 00:03:14.449
duckweed is much more robust organism
it's it's a real plant and so it can

00:03:14.449 --> 00:03:14.459
it's it's a real plant and so it can
 

00:03:14.459 --> 00:03:16.910
it's it's a real plant and so it can
grow outdoors it doesn't have big

00:03:16.910 --> 00:03:16.920
grow outdoors it doesn't have big
 

00:03:16.920 --> 00:03:19.460
grow outdoors it doesn't have big
pathogen problems and it could go very

00:03:19.460 --> 00:03:19.470
pathogen problems and it could go very
 

00:03:19.470 --> 00:03:22.009
pathogen problems and it could go very
very fast so if we can persuade duckweed

00:03:22.009 --> 00:03:22.019
very fast so if we can persuade duckweed
 

00:03:22.019 --> 00:03:24.830
very fast so if we can persuade duckweed
to make oil instead of starch we would

00:03:24.830 --> 00:03:24.840
to make oil instead of starch we would
 

00:03:24.840 --> 00:03:27.559
to make oil instead of starch we would
be a long way on the path to making a

be a long way on the path to making a
 

00:03:27.569 --> 00:03:29.520
be a long way on the path to making a
