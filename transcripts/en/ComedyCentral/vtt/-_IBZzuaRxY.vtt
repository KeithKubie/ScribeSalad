the word "Christ" in it.

All right.
Fair enough.

00:01:22.081 --> 00:01:23.649
Yeah, I think
it's Christmas too.

00:01:23.649 --> 00:01:25.184
I was in New York this year.

00:01:25.184 --> 00:01:26.586
It was my first time being
in New York for Christmas.

00:01:26.586 --> 00:01:27.586
I've always been in LA

00:01:27.586 --> 00:01:28.921
for, like, the Christmas season,

00:01:28.921 --> 00:01:30.122
which is the best time
of the year here,

00:01:30.122 --> 00:01:31.657
'cause everyone leaves.

00:01:31.657 --> 00:01:33.793
So this place is at, like,
30% capacity.

00:01:33.793 --> 00:01:36.295
You can find parking spots.
It's fucking wonderful.

00:01:36.295 --> 00:01:38.665
Like, oh, this is how
the city was built,

00:01:38.665 --> 00:01:40.499
for this amount of people.
It's great.

00:01:40.499 --> 00:01:41.834
But I was in New York,
and in New York,

00:01:41.834 --> 00:01:43.436
they doll up the streets.

00:01:43.436 --> 00:01:45.872
They put, like, Christmas lights
all over, and for the first time

00:01:45.872 --> 00:01:47.874
in my life
I got the Christmas spirit.

00:01:47.874 --> 00:01:49.542
Yeah,
I'd never gotten it before.

00:01:49.542 --> 00:01:52.778
As a Jew, we weren't told
what the Christmas spirit was.

00:01:52.778 --> 00:01:55.280
My dad wouldn't even say
the word "Christmas"

00:01:55.280 --> 00:01:58.017

00:01:58.017 --> 00:02:00.519
For real, he literally

00:02:00.519 --> 00:02:03.289
"Croshmere."

00:02:03.289 --> 00:02:05.625
Yeah, he wouldn't say it
with any sort of spite.

00:02:05.625 --> 00:02:08.861
He was just like, "I'm not
saying that fucking word, so...

00:02:08.861 --> 00:02:12.531
what are you guys doing for
your Chroshmere break?"

00:02:12.531 --> 00:02:14.367
[laughs]
I forgot about that.

00:02:14.367 --> 00:02:17.536
And...and so I never got
the Christmas spirit before.

00:02:17.536 --> 00:02:18.704
And listen, you guys,
Christians,

00:02:18.704 --> 00:02:20.339
you've done a lot of fucking...

00:02:20.339 --> 00:02:22.041
shady shit over the years.

00:02:22.041 --> 00:02:24.811
But Christmas spirit, I've got
no problem at all with that.

00:02:24.811 --> 00:02:26.145
That's just nice.
It's when you hold the door open

00:02:26.145 --> 00:02:27.913
for somebody and go,
"Merry Christmas."

00:02:27.913 --> 00:02:30.016
And then they go in, they go,
"Merry Christmas to you."

00:02:30.016 --> 00:02:31.917
And the first year in New York,
for the first time,

00:02:31.917 --> 00:02:33.352
I got the Christmas spirit.

00:02:33.352 --> 00:02:34.353
And I would hold the door open

00:02:34.353 --> 00:02:35.521
for everybody all the time.

00:02:35.521 --> 00:02:36.555
I'd be like, "Merry Christmas,"

00:02:36.555 --> 00:02:37.990
and they'd look at me like,

00:02:37.990 --> 00:02:41.560
"Are you s--'cause...
you're very--"

00:02:41.560 --> 00:02:42.661
I'm like, "I'm not mocking you,"

00:02:42.661 --> 00:02:44.163
and they're like, "All right,

00:02:44.163 --> 00:02:45.898
I'll go in.
You're holding the door open."

00:02:45.898 --> 00:02:48.067
Anyway, so my first year
I got the Christmas spirit,

00:02:48.067 --> 00:02:49.902
and this year was one of those
years where Hanukkah

00:02:49.902 --> 00:02:51.404
and Christmas overlapped.

00:02:51.404 --> 00:02:53.072
It was, like, Christmas fell on,
like, the fourth day

00:02:53.072 --> 00:02:55.408
of Hanukkah, and this was, like,
three or four days.

00:02:55.408 --> 00:02:58.411
The first night of Hanukkah
I was walking down my block

00:02:58.411 --> 00:03:00.913
in New York and I passed some
guy on the street,

00:03:00.913 --> 00:03:03.849
and he goes, "Hey,
can I use your cell phone?"

00:03:03.849 --> 00:03:06.752
It was, like, some Persian or
Armenian guy or something.

00:03:06.752 --> 00:03:08.021
It's got nothing to do
with the story.

00:03:08.021 --> 00:03:09.888
I don't know why--
straight racism.

00:03:09.888 --> 00:03:12.091
There's no reason to say that
at all.

00:03:12.091 --> 00:03:13.258
[laughs]

00:03:13.258 --> 00:03:15.061
It has nothing to do with it,
but anyway,

00:03:15.061 --> 00:03:16.862
he goes,
"Can I use your cell phone?"

00:03:16.862 --> 00:03:18.598
And you know when a stranger
asks you to use your cell phone,

00:03:18.598 --> 00:03:20.866
that means that's the guy who's
about to steal your cell phone.

00:03:20.866 --> 00:03:23.101
Yeah, like, sure,
guy with brand new Nikes on.

00:03:23.101 --> 00:03:24.804
I'm sure I'll give this to you.

00:03:24.804 --> 00:03:26.104
But I have a flip phone,
so I'm like,

00:03:26.104 --> 00:03:27.607
"Yeah, I'll call your bluff."

00:03:27.607 --> 00:03:29.875
[laughter]

00:03:29.875 --> 00:03:31.910
You know?
What, are you gonna risk jail

00:03:31.910 --> 00:03:33.946
and run away for
a fucking $19 piece of

00:03:33.946 --> 00:03:37.216
equipment you don't know
how to use?

00:03:37.216 --> 00:03:39.218
So I was like, "Here you go."
And so he goes--he opened it.

00:03:39.218 --> 00:03:41.086
He--like, "How do you--
how do you use this?"

00:03:41.086 --> 00:03:42.388
And I was like,
"Got to flip it open."

00:03:42.388 --> 00:03:43.789
He goes, "It opens?"

00:03:43.789 --> 00:03:45.057
I'm like, "Yeah, man.
It's great."

00:03:45.057 --> 00:03:46.959
And so he dials--
and then he goes,

00:03:46.959 --> 00:03:48.394
he dialed some number
and he goes, "Hey,

00:03:48.394 --> 00:03:49.828
"it's the delivery guy.
I'm downstairs.

00:03:49.828 --> 00:03:51.330
I got your food."

00:03:51.330 --> 00:03:52.898
He had a bag of food on him.
He was a delivery guy.

00:03:52.898 --> 00:03:54.133
I was like, "Oh, cool."

00:03:54.133 --> 00:03:55.668
And then he handed me back
the phone.

00:03:55.668 --> 00:03:56.669
He goes, "Thanks."
I was like, "Hey, man.

00:03:56.669 --> 00:03:57.970
Merry Christmas."

00:03:57.970 --> 00:03:59.605
And he goes,
"Merry Christmas to you."

00:03:59.605 --> 00:04:00.806
Felt great.

00:04:00.806 --> 00:04:03.109
I felt like
Martin Luther King, Jr.

00:04:03.109 --> 00:04:05.110
I don't want to go too far,
but about that level.

00:04:05.110 --> 00:04:08.347
And then--and then I walked away
feeling great about myself.

00:04:08.347 --> 00:04:09.815
Did a good deed for the year.

00:04:09.815 --> 00:04:12.818
And--and then I got
about three--

00:04:12.818 --> 00:04:15.287
two, three blocks away,
and my phone rang,

00:04:15.287 --> 00:04:17.657
and it was the same number,
I guess,

00:04:17.657 --> 00:04:18.657
that that guy had called.

00:04:18.657 --> 00:04:19.658
He was calling me back.

00:04:19.658 --> 00:04:21.293
And I was like,
"Hello?"

00:04:21.293 --> 00:04:24.330
And he goes--and then the guy
on it goes, "Where are you?"

00:04:24.330 --> 00:04:27.099
[scattered laughter]

00:04:27.099 --> 00:04:30.202
And I didn't want to get
involved, you know?

00:04:30.202 --> 00:04:33.472
So I was just like,
"I'm right downstairs."

00:04:33.472 --> 00:04:36.375
[laughter]

00:04:36.375 --> 00:04:38.444
And he goes, "Where?
I don't see you."

00:04:38.444 --> 00:04:40.713
And I'm like, "I don't know.
I'm right here, man."

00:04:40.713 --> 00:04:43.282
[laughter]

00:04:43.282 --> 00:04:44.683
And he's like,
"What do you look like?"

00:04:44.683 --> 00:04:46.185
I'm like, "I don't know.

00:04:46.185 --> 00:04:48.054
I'm, like, Persian or Armenian
or something."

00:04:48.054 --> 00:04:50.789

00:04:50.789 --> 00:04:52.725

00:04:54.126 --> 00:04:55.961

I don't see anybody like that."

00:04:58.364 --> 00:05:00.532
I was like, "All right, well"--
I told him like,

00:05:00.532 --> 00:05:03.235
"Listen, man, I'm not the guy."

00:05:03.235 --> 00:05:04.971
And he's like, "What?
What do you mean?"

00:05:04.971 --> 00:05:06.171
I'm like,
"I'm not the delivery guy."

00:05:06.171 --> 00:05:08.074
And he was like,
"I just talked to you."

00:05:08.074 --> 00:05:09.708
And I'm like, "You didn't.

00:05:09.708 --> 00:05:11.076

And the guy couldn't wrap
his head around it.

He's like, "What? Wait.
What?"

00:05:27.693 --> 00:05:29.262

you do, really.

"to 12th and B 'cause it's there
waiting for you,

has no cell phone,

00:05:56.956 --> 00:06:00.459
so he's not gonna
be able to contact you."

And he's like--
he was, like, real--a dick then.

00:06:02.194 --> 00:06:03.796
He's like,
"Well, I'm not paying for this."

00:06:03.796 --> 00:06:06.866
I'm like, "Yeah. As an American,
I don't think you should."

00:06:06.866 --> 00:06:08.267
He was all mad--
still mad at me,

00:06:08.267 --> 00:06:09.769
like I had something
to do with it.

00:06:09.769 --> 00:06:12.371
I'm not.
I'm just a good person.

00:06:12.371 --> 00:06:14.039
And he goes,
"Well, can you go tell him?"

00:06:14.039 --> 00:06:15.041
Like, "Nah, nah, nah.

00:06:15.041 --> 00:06:16.742
"Nah, nah, nah, nah, nah.

00:06:16.742 --> 00:06:17.877
"I'm, like, three blocks away.

00:06:17.877 --> 00:06:19.278
"You're one block away.

00:06:19.278 --> 00:06:20.612
"You're way closer,
and if you find him,

"you get a sandwich out of it.

00:06:22.048 --> 00:06:24.283
I don't get anything out of it
if I find him."

00:06:24.283 --> 00:06:26.284
And then he said
it's ridiculous.

00:06:26.284 --> 00:06:27.954
I'm like, "Yeah, sure it is."

00:06:27.954 --> 00:06:29.421
And then he made a series
of noises for the next

00:06:29.421 --> 00:06:30.256
30 or 40 seconds.

00:06:30.256 --> 00:06:32.225
Just like...

00:06:36.729 --> 00:06:39.165
Just the sound
of white injustice.

00:06:39.165 --> 00:06:40.833
[laughter]

00:06:40.833 --> 00:06:42.468
You know?

00:06:42.468 --> 00:06:43.970
It's like when they don't accept
your expired coupon.

00:06:43.970 --> 00:06:45.304
You're like,
"What the f--what--

00:06:45.304 --> 00:06:48.807
I mean,
Papa John's would take it."

00:06:48.807 --> 00:06:52.278
I don't think so, but all right.

00:06:52.278 --> 00:06:54.613
And then there was nothing else
to say, you know?

00:06:54.613 --> 00:06:56.983
There was nothing else to do,
so eventually I just told--

00:06:56.983 --> 00:06:59.684
I was like, "Okay, well"--
I was like,

00:06:59.684 --> 00:07:00.686
"I'm getting off the phone now."

00:07:00.686 --> 00:07:02.688
And he goes, "Yeah, I bet."

00:07:02.688 --> 00:07:05.123
I'm like--

00:07:05.123 --> 00:07:08.427
and I'm like,
"Well, happy Hanukkah."

00:07:08.427 --> 00:07:11.964
[laughter]

00:07:11.964 --> 00:07:14.467
And he goes, "Fuck you."

00:07:14.467 --> 00:07:15.601
[laughter]

00:07:15.601 --> 00:07:17.336
And then he hung up.

00:07:17.336 --> 00:07:19.171
And that's how I know people
like saying "merry Christmas"

00:07:19.171 --> 00:07:22.341
better than
"happy Hanukkah."
