00:00:04.350 --> 00:00:10.620
The Little Albert Experiment was a study conducted
back in 1920 by famed psychologist, “the

00:00:10.620 --> 00:00:12.670
father of behaviorism”, John B. Watson.

00:00:12.670 --> 00:00:16.600
It essentially involved conditioning a baby,
identified only as “Albert.

00:00:16.600 --> 00:00:20.740
B” to experience fear at the sight of anything
fluffy.

00:00:20.740 --> 00:00:26.620
Putting aside the egregious methodology problems
and questionable ethics exhibited during the

00:00:26.620 --> 00:00:31.210
experiment, the reported results of the study,
and its significance in the history of psychology,

00:00:31.210 --> 00:00:37.249
have seen the study become one of the most
famous and oft cited in the entire field of

00:00:37.249 --> 00:00:38.379
human psychology.

00:00:38.379 --> 00:00:40.690
So how did it all start?

00:00:40.690 --> 00:00:46.579
Watson was greatly intrigued by the work of
Russian researcher Ivan Pavlov who inadvertently

00:00:46.579 --> 00:00:50.940
stumbled upon the idea of conditioning theory
while conducting an unrelated study on the

00:00:50.940 --> 00:00:52.980
digestive system of dogs.

00:00:52.980 --> 00:00:57.629
For the uninitiated, during his research,
Pavlov made the curious observation that his

00:00:57.629 --> 00:01:02.909
fuzzy research subjects would begin salivate
before being presented with food almost as

00:01:02.909 --> 00:01:04.070
if they knew it was coming.

00:01:04.070 --> 00:01:08.531
Pavlov eventually realised that the dogs were
in fact salivating at the sight of his research

00:01:08.531 --> 00:01:14.100
assistants walking into the room and that
the dogs had come to associate them with food.

00:01:14.100 --> 00:01:18.280
After several experiments, Pavlov was able
to make the dogs salivate at the mere sound

00:01:18.280 --> 00:01:23.200
of a metronome ticking, a previously neutral
stimulus, among many other stimuli, leading

00:01:23.200 --> 00:01:28.090
him to the conclusion that responses to a
random stimulus could be conditioned given

00:01:28.090 --> 00:01:29.200
the right tools.

00:01:29.200 --> 00:01:33.240
As for Watson, he was curious about whether
humans could be conditioned in the same way

00:01:33.240 --> 00:01:37.450
(in truth, Pavlov later experimented with
orphan children wondering the same thing-

00:01:37.450 --> 00:01:43.079
see Bonus Facts below); so naturally, rather
than conduct experiments that would have no

00:01:43.079 --> 00:01:47.799
chance of being psychologically damaging in
any way to a child, Watson decided to go with

00:01:47.799 --> 00:01:48.990
terrifying a baby.

00:01:48.990 --> 00:01:53.030
The experiment was conducted on an infant
as Watson believed them to be blank slates

00:01:53.030 --> 00:01:57.020
emotionally speaking and according to the
scant amount of information left over from

00:01:57.020 --> 00:02:01.909
the experiment (Watson burned many of his
original notes prior to his death in 1958)

00:02:01.909 --> 00:02:06.759
little Albert was “chosen” from a hospital
located on the grounds of John Hopkins University

00:02:06.759 --> 00:02:09.569
at the age of 8 months and 26 days.

00:02:09.569 --> 00:02:13.380
According to the original paper, Albert was
chosen due to his remarkably calm temperament

00:02:13.380 --> 00:02:18.300
with Watson and his graduate student (and
mistress) Roslie Raynor describing him as

00:02:18.300 --> 00:02:22.880
a wholly “stolid and unemotional” infant
who very rarely cried.

00:02:22.880 --> 00:02:27.470
After being selected, Albert was given a series
of tests in Watson’s “infant laboratory”

00:02:27.470 --> 00:02:30.780
to establish his baseline reaction to a number
of stimuli.

00:02:30.780 --> 00:02:35.340
Over the course of a number of experiments,
Albert was exposed to a white lab rat, a rabbit,

00:02:35.340 --> 00:02:40.720
a monkey and for some reason burning newspaper,
none of which seemed to phase the awesomely

00:02:40.720 --> 00:02:42.190
stoic Albert.

00:02:42.190 --> 00:02:46.300
Ultimately Watson waited until Albert was
11 months and 3 days old before continuing

00:02:46.300 --> 00:02:51.700
his experiment, during which he once again
present Albert with a fluffy white lab rat.

00:02:51.700 --> 00:02:55.230
As Watson expected, Albert reached out to
pet his new fuzzy companion, at which point

00:02:55.230 --> 00:02:59.940
Watson used a hammer to strike a concealed
four foot long, 3/4 inch in diameter steel

00:02:59.940 --> 00:03:05.180
bar directly behind the baby causing a loud
ringing noise, which resulted in Albert crying.

00:03:05.180 --> 00:03:09.320
Watson repeated this experiment multiple times
until eventually just the sight of the rat

00:03:09.320 --> 00:03:13.590
caused Albert to (seemingly) become frightened
and try to crawl away.

00:03:13.590 --> 00:03:17.150
For allowing her child to participate in this
experiment, Albert’s mother was paid the

00:03:17.150 --> 00:03:21.570
princely sum of a single US dollar (about
$12 today).

00:03:21.570 --> 00:03:26.300
(It has also been noted that the mother in
question may well have only agreed to the

00:03:26.300 --> 00:03:30.010
experiment for fear of losing her job if she
did not; she is generally thought to have

00:03:30.010 --> 00:03:33.760
worked as a wet-nurse at The Harriet Lane
Home for Invalid Children affiliated with

00:03:33.760 --> 00:03:35.530
Johns Hopkins University)

00:03:35.530 --> 00:03:40.100
But making a child terrified of rats isn’t
so bad, right?

00:03:40.100 --> 00:03:44.780
I mean, there’s even small potential that
this could be beneficial at some point; nobody

00:03:44.780 --> 00:03:48.050
wants their child getting bitten by a wild
rat, for instance.

00:03:48.050 --> 00:03:53.120
The problem was that, as Watson had theorised,
Albert generalized and became terrified of

00:03:53.120 --> 00:03:58.370
anything with fur including rabbits, dogs
and even men with fluffy white beards.

00:03:58.370 --> 00:04:03.140
To make matters worse, Watson didn’t bother
to desensitize the child when Albert was ultimately

00:04:03.140 --> 00:04:04.800
released from the hospital.

00:04:04.800 --> 00:04:08.250
How did he justify this sort of experiment
on an infant?

00:04:08.250 --> 00:04:09.850
In his own words,

00:04:09.850 --> 00:04:14.200
At first there was considerable hesitation
upon our part in making the attempt to set

00:04:14.200 --> 00:04:16.120
up fear reactions experimentally.

00:04:16.120 --> 00:04:19.020
A certain responsibility attaches to such
a procedure.

00:04:19.020 --> 00:04:23.990
We decided finally to make the attempt, comforting
ourselves by the reflection that such attachments

00:04:23.990 --> 00:04:28.520
would arise anyway as soon as the child left
the sheltered environment of the nursery for

00:04:28.520 --> 00:04:31.110
the rough and tumble of the home.

00:04:31.110 --> 00:04:38.250
So did Albert grow up with a crippling phobia
of fur and beards?

00:04:38.250 --> 00:04:40.870
This isn’t known, nor is the identity of
the child.

00:04:40.870 --> 00:04:44.830
That said, researchers have come up with two
possible names based on what little information

00:04:44.830 --> 00:04:48.600
we have- Douglas Merrite and William Barger.

00:04:48.600 --> 00:04:52.090
The case for both Merrite and Barger being
Albert are very strong as they were born within

00:04:52.090 --> 00:04:56.800
a day of one another at the same hospital
whence Albert was chosen and both had mothers

00:04:56.800 --> 00:04:58.200
who were wet-nurses, of which there were only
four employed at any one time in the hospital.

00:04:58.200 --> 00:05:02.080
The name Douglas Merrite was happened upon
after an exhaustive 7 year study helmed by

00:05:02.080 --> 00:05:07.970
Hall P. Beck, his colleague Sharman Levinson
and a relative of Merrite named Gary Irons.

00:05:07.970 --> 00:05:12.940
Sadly, Merrite’s story isn’t a happy one
and if he is indeed was Albert, it casts the

00:05:12.940 --> 00:05:16.080
already controversial experiment in an even
darker light.

00:05:16.080 --> 00:05:19.830
According to Beck’s research, Merrite was
the son of a wet-nurse named Arvilla Merrite.

00:05:19.830 --> 00:05:23.090
Starkly contrasting Watson’s description
of Albert as one of “the best-developed

00:05:23.090 --> 00:05:26.800
youngsters ever brought to the hospital”,
Merrite was a very sickly baby who suffered

00:05:26.800 --> 00:05:30.750
horribly from hydrocephalus (fluid on the
brain); a condition which eventually claimed

00:05:30.750 --> 00:05:31.860
his life at the age of 6.

00:05:31.860 --> 00:05:36.580
If true, this would mean that Watson deliberately
lied in his paper and perhaps more importantly,

00:05:36.580 --> 00:05:40.660
spent a considerable amount of time tormenting
a deathly ill infant.

00:05:40.660 --> 00:05:43.890
Although Beck’s research was thorough, it
wasn’t conclusive.

00:05:43.890 --> 00:05:47.780
As a result, some researchers choose to believe
that little Albert was actually a baby named

00:05:47.780 --> 00:05:48.980
William Barger.

00:05:48.980 --> 00:05:53.650
Unlike Merrite, Barger was described as being
the picture of health as a child, which falls

00:05:53.650 --> 00:05:55.220
in line with Watson’s description.

00:05:55.220 --> 00:05:59.210
Barger’s medical records also indicate that
he was a healthy weight for a baby, whilst

00:05:59.210 --> 00:06:03.800
Merrite was underweight, the latter of which
doesn’t at all fit with the known images

00:06:03.800 --> 00:06:07.410
(and video) of Albert showing a plump, robust
infant.

00:06:07.410 --> 00:06:11.410
Finally, it was discovered that Barger’s
middle name was, in fact, Albert and that

00:06:11.410 --> 00:06:15.670
is what he always went by even into adulthood,
which would explain how Watson came up with

00:06:15.670 --> 00:06:17.540
the name “Albert B”.

00:06:17.540 --> 00:06:21.490
Barger had a considerably happier life than
Merrite, living to the ripe old age of 87

00:06:21.490 --> 00:06:25.840
and, according to friends and family, he was
a nice man who lived a fulfilling life, though

00:06:25.840 --> 00:06:30.920
he reportedly had an aversion to dogs which
his family enjoyed teasing him about (at least,

00:06:30.920 --> 00:06:33.730
according to his niece).

00:06:33.730 --> 00:06:37.710
While Pavlov today is famous for his experiments
with dogs, a little known fact seemingly left

00:06:37.710 --> 00:06:42.430
out of every text book the world over is that
the much honoured Pavlov conducted the same

00:06:42.430 --> 00:06:47.240
experiments on orphan children, including
surgically implanting the same type of saliva

00:06:47.240 --> 00:06:51.380
collectors on some of them, as you see in
the picture on the right.

00:06:51.380 --> 00:06:55.740
Further, his experiments on dogs and humans
didn’t stop at positive reinforcement; he

00:06:55.740 --> 00:07:00.080
also experimented with negative reinforcement,
such as flooding the dogs’ kennels to make

00:07:00.080 --> 00:07:04.480
them think they would drown and shocking them
instead of using metronomes or other such

00:07:04.480 --> 00:07:07.139
humane queues.

00:07:07.139 --> 00:07:11.080
Watson was forced to resign from his position
at Johns Hopkins University, not because of

00:07:11.080 --> 00:07:15.130
any experiment, but because of an affair he
had with one of his graduate students, Rosalie

00:07:15.130 --> 00:07:17.980
Rayner, who helped him on the Little Albert
experiment.

00:07:17.980 --> 00:07:21.410
After becoming suspicious, Watson’s wife
managed to sneak into Rayner’s bedroom and

00:07:21.410 --> 00:07:25.410
found love letters from her husband to Rayner,
some of which were later published in the

00:07:25.410 --> 00:07:26.410
newspaper.

00:07:26.410 --> 00:07:30.220
In the resulting very public scandal, Watson
was forced to resign, divorced his wife, almost

00:07:30.220 --> 00:07:34.420
immediately married Rayner (who would die
approximately 14 years later of dysentery),

00:07:34.420 --> 00:07:37.510
then took what ultimately turned out to be
an extremely lucrative job in advertising,

00:07:37.510 --> 00:07:42.850
including one of his very successful Maxwell
House coffee ad campaigns being credited with

00:07:42.850 --> 00:07:47.730
popularising the now ubiquitous “coffee
break”.

00:07:47.730 --> 00:07:51.470
Among his other exploits, Watson also put
significant work into the study of the best

00:07:51.470 --> 00:07:55.631
way to raise children, including writing a
popular book on the subject called, Psychological

00:07:55.631 --> 00:07:58.010
Care of Infant and Child.

00:07:58.010 --> 00:08:01.660
It advocated, among other things, making sure
mothers and fathers didn’t bestow much affection

00:08:01.660 --> 00:08:06.050
or tenderness on their children (with particular
emphasis on mothers, including a whole chapter

00:08:06.050 --> 00:08:08.090
titled Too Much Motherly Love).

00:08:08.090 --> 00:08:12.740
As for Watson’s own two children raised
with this method, both attempted suicide.

00:08:12.740 --> 00:08:13.740
One succeeded.

00:08:13.740 --> 00:08:18.750
The other claimed he and his brother’s struggles
with depression, among other emotional issues,

00:08:18.750 --> 00:08:23.220
were the result of his father’s behaviorism
parenting principles.

00:08:23.220 --> 00:08:26.600
Watson’s research certainly wasn’t all
bad, of course.

00:08:26.600 --> 00:08:31.770
His ideas on behaviorism were hugely influential
in the world of psychology, among other contributions.

00:08:31.770 --> 00:08:35.830
He was also one of those staunchly against
the idea of eugenics, which was extremely

00:08:35.830 --> 00:08:37.939
popular at the time throughout the developed
world.

00:08:37.939 --> 00:08:41.199
(This popularity would later reverse in most
countries after WWII.)

00:08:41.199 --> 00:08:44.630
Watson believed that the notion of breeding
out undesirables was fundamentally flawed

00:08:44.630 --> 00:08:48.819
and that one’s upbringing had far more of
an effect on the ultimate quality of individual

00:08:48.819 --> 00:08:49.899
than genetics.

00:08:49.899 --> 00:08:54.199
He further stated in his 1930 book, Behaviorism,
concerning his argument against eugenics,

00:08:54.199 --> 00:08:58.649
“Give me a dozen healthy infants, well-formed,
and my own specified world to bring them up

00:08:58.649 --> 00:09:02.939
in and I’ll guarantee to take any one at
random and train him to become any type of

00:09:02.939 --> 00:09:08.790
specialist I might select – doctor, lawyer,
artist, merchant-chief and, yes, even beggar-man

00:09:08.790 --> 00:09:13.790
and thief, regardless of his talents, penchants,
tendencies, abilities, vocations, and race

00:09:13.790 --> 00:09:14.790
of his ancestors.

00:09:14.790 --> 00:09:18.959
I am going beyond my facts and I admit it,
but so have the advocates of the contrary

00:09:18.959 --> 00:09:35.170
and they have been doing it for many thousands

00:09:35.170 --> 00:09:41.300
of years.”
