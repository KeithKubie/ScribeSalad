00:00:01.770 --> 00:00:02.690
Matthew?

00:00:02.690 --> 00:00:03.130
&gt;&gt; Yes?

00:00:03.130 --> 00:00:04.230
&gt;&gt; I have a surprise for you.

00:00:04.230 --> 00:00:05.100
&gt;&gt; Oh what'd you get me?

00:00:05.100 --> 00:00:06.530
&gt;&gt; My genome.

00:00:06.530 --> 00:00:09.940
&gt;&gt; Oh you got your genome's information back. What do you think?

00:00:09.940 --> 00:00:12.540
&gt;&gt; I love it. It's really exciting. I found out a lot

00:00:12.540 --> 00:00:16.710
about my traits. Including some diseases that I'm not a carrier for.

00:00:16.710 --> 00:00:17.040
&gt;&gt; Great.

00:00:17.040 --> 00:00:21.850
&gt;&gt; Which is great news. As well as my risk factor for some complex traits.

00:00:21.850 --> 00:00:24.350
&gt;&gt; Well, it's kind of like a big storybook of you, isn't it?

00:00:24.350 --> 00:00:26.780
&gt;&gt; It is, except that there's something missing that I

00:00:26.780 --> 00:00:27.850
kind of wanted to know about.

00:00:27.850 --> 00:00:28.400
&gt;&gt; What's that?

00:00:28.400 --> 00:00:31.520
&gt;&gt; I wanted to know, like, where I fit in in the grand scheme of things.

00:00:31.520 --> 00:00:34.620
&gt;&gt; Well, Lauren, when, when two people love each other very much.

00:00:34.620 --> 00:00:37.680
&gt;&gt; Okay, Matt, Matt, I know where I came from in that way.

00:00:37.680 --> 00:00:37.940
&gt;&gt; Oh.

00:00:37.940 --> 00:00:38.990
&gt;&gt; I've had that talk before.

00:00:38.990 --> 00:00:39.110
&gt;&gt; Right.

00:00:39.110 --> 00:00:42.350
&gt;&gt; I'm talking about, like, 10000 years of ancestry.

00:00:42.350 --> 00:00:43.630
I want to know where I came from like that.

00:00:43.630 --> 00:00:47.860
&gt;&gt; Well, it is true. Your genome can really reveal that information

00:00:47.860 --> 00:00:52.770
giving you close family members even answers into your deep distant past.

00:00:52.770 --> 00:00:57.510
All you need to know, is where to look. What? Where are we?

00:00:57.510 --> 00:01:00.620
&gt;&gt; Yeah, this is the genome library. And all of these

00:01:00.620 --> 00:01:04.190
books represent the genomes of thousands of people all across the world.

00:01:04.190 --> 00:01:04.569
&gt;&gt; Wow!

00:01:04.569 --> 00:01:07.950
&gt;&gt; And using this information we can make comparisons and,

00:01:07.950 --> 00:01:11.900
possibly find family relationships that you never even knew about before.

00:01:11.900 --> 00:01:14.070
&gt;&gt; Well, I mean, I know I have a brother,

00:01:14.070 --> 00:01:15.840
and I have half-brother, I have parents, I know those things.

00:01:15.840 --> 00:01:18.370
&gt;&gt; Well sure, you know these relationships.

00:01:18.370 --> 00:01:20.330
But your genome has a lot of secrets to

00:01:20.330 --> 00:01:22.180
it, and it could possibly reveal that some of

00:01:22.180 --> 00:01:24.230
the relationships you think are true may not be

00:01:24.230 --> 00:01:26.480
as true as you think. And it could reveal

00:01:26.480 --> 00:01:28.930
new relationships you never even knew about before. And

00:01:28.930 --> 00:01:31.400
don't forget, there are adopted individuals who never even

00:01:31.400 --> 00:01:33.520
had an opportunity to know who their blood relatives

00:01:33.520 --> 00:01:35.370
are, so this could be a great opportunity for them.

00:01:35.370 --> 00:01:37.180
&gt;&gt; Well they're really fortunate to have this

00:01:37.180 --> 00:01:39.220
school, I think this is an awesome opportunity for

00:01:39.220 --> 00:01:41.780
anybody. But, I am still interested in knowing

00:01:41.780 --> 00:01:43.640
where I fit in the grand scheme of things.

00:01:43.640 --> 00:01:46.340
Well, you're in luck, Lauren, because with this genomic

00:01:46.340 --> 00:01:49.280
information, we can get pretty far in answering that question.
