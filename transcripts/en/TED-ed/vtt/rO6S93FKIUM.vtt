00:00:06.703 --> 00:00:10.264
What lights up the screen 
that you're looking at right now?

00:00:10.264 --> 00:00:12.922
Trace back 
the battery chargers and power cords

00:00:12.922 --> 00:00:15.270
and you'll end up at an electrical outlet,

00:00:15.270 --> 00:00:19.182
providing easy, safe access 
to reliable electricity.

00:00:19.182 --> 00:00:22.202
But beyond that outlet, 
the picture gets messier.

00:00:22.202 --> 00:00:24.205
It takes a lot of fuel to heat our homes,

00:00:24.205 --> 00:00:25.730
preserve our food,

00:00:25.730 --> 00:00:28.334
and our power our gadgets 
around the clock.

00:00:28.334 --> 00:00:32.023
And for 40% of the world, 
that fuel is cheap, plentiful,

00:00:32.023 --> 00:00:34.470
and it's called coal.

00:00:34.470 --> 00:00:37.167
But coal also releases 
pollutants into the air,

00:00:37.167 --> 00:00:38.802
like sulfur dioxide,

00:00:38.802 --> 00:00:40.439
nitrogen oxides,

00:00:40.439 --> 00:00:41.398
soot,

00:00:41.398 --> 00:00:43.897
and toxic metals, like mercury.

00:00:43.897 --> 00:00:46.617
These cause environmental damage,
like acid rain,

00:00:46.617 --> 00:00:48.247
and serious health problems.

00:00:48.247 --> 00:00:53.439
In fact, in 1952, coal burning 
caused such heavy smog in London

00:00:53.439 --> 00:00:56.192
that pedestrians 
couldn't even see their feet,

00:00:56.192 --> 00:00:59.628
and thousands of people died
from ill health.

00:00:59.628 --> 00:01:02.295
Since then, many countries 
have deployed technology

00:01:02.295 --> 00:01:05.427
to remove most of these pollutants 
before they reach the air.

00:01:05.427 --> 00:01:08.605
But now we have a new 
air pollution problem on our hands,

00:01:08.605 --> 00:01:11.364
one that doesn't show up 
in a cloud of dark smog,

00:01:11.364 --> 00:01:12.774
but in rising seas,

00:01:12.774 --> 00:01:13.616
floods,

00:01:13.616 --> 00:01:14.965
and heat waves.

00:01:14.965 --> 00:01:16.632
It's global climate change,

00:01:16.632 --> 00:01:19.612
and again, the main culprit is coal.

00:01:19.612 --> 00:01:24.173
It's responsible for 44%
of global carbon dioxide emissions,

00:01:24.173 --> 00:01:26.911
which trap the sun's heat 
in the Earth's atmosphere,

00:01:26.911 --> 00:01:28.541
instead of letting it escape.

00:01:28.541 --> 00:01:32.924
So now the question is 
how do we remove that bad stuff as well?

00:01:32.924 --> 00:01:35.629
That's the idea behind cleaner coal.

00:01:35.629 --> 00:01:39.776
Creating cleaner coal is really about 
trying to contain its ill effects

00:01:39.776 --> 00:01:44.910
with the help of special technologies
that make the end product more acceptable.

00:01:44.910 --> 00:01:47.419
Just like the most intriguing superheroes

00:01:47.419 --> 00:01:50.086
often have their own dark powers 
to overcome,

00:01:50.086 --> 00:01:53.683
so we can try and keep 
coal's negative forces in check.

00:01:53.683 --> 00:01:56.053
But why don't we just exterminate coal

00:01:56.053 --> 00:01:58.781
if it takes that much effort
to clean it up?

00:01:58.781 --> 00:02:03.179
Simply, coal is extremely valuable to us,
and it's easy to come by.

00:02:03.179 --> 00:02:05.273
Compressed underground for ages,

00:02:05.273 --> 00:02:07.804
coal holds chemical energy from plants

00:02:07.804 --> 00:02:11.110
that were fed from by the sun 
hundreds of millions of years ago,

00:02:11.110 --> 00:02:13.420
long before humans evolved.

00:02:13.420 --> 00:02:18.369
That makes coal energy dense, 
meaning it can be burned 'round the clock.

00:02:18.369 --> 00:02:21.713
It's also cheap, 
if you ignore the pollution costs,

00:02:21.713 --> 00:02:25.276
and should last us 
through the end of the 21st century.

00:02:25.276 --> 00:02:29.285
We've already got all the infrastructure 
in place for harnessing its power,

00:02:29.285 --> 00:02:30.145
and globally,

00:02:30.145 --> 00:02:31.963
although countries are making a move

00:02:31.963 --> 00:02:35.067
towards energy from
cleaner and more renewable sources,

00:02:35.067 --> 00:02:39.010
there's no sign yet 
that coal use is slowing down.

00:02:39.010 --> 00:02:40.788
In fact, as of 2012,

00:02:40.788 --> 00:02:44.113
over 1000 new coal plants 
have been proposed,

00:02:44.113 --> 00:02:46.205
mostly in China and India.

00:02:46.205 --> 00:02:49.191
Since for the time being 
coal is here to stay,

00:02:49.191 --> 00:02:53.231
experts say that if we want to reduce 
its emissions' impact on the atmosphere,

00:02:53.231 --> 00:02:54.903
and slow down climate change,

00:02:54.903 --> 00:02:59.659
we'll have to think of creative ways 
of reducing coal's destructive power.

00:02:59.659 --> 00:03:03.318
To do that, we need 
to strip it of its foul forces,

00:03:03.318 --> 00:03:07.655
all that toxic carbon dioxide 
that causes havoc in the atmosphere.

00:03:07.655 --> 00:03:10.642
Then, we need to store 
the CO2 somewhere else.

00:03:10.642 --> 00:03:14.303
This mission is called 
carbon capture and sequestration,

00:03:14.303 --> 00:03:15.745
or CCS.

00:03:15.745 --> 00:03:20.524
And as if carbon dioxide were some 
evil genie we didn't want to escape,

00:03:20.524 --> 00:03:22.614
once it has been separated from coal,

00:03:22.614 --> 00:03:25.947
we've devised ways 
to banish it underground.

00:03:25.947 --> 00:03:28.782
We can do this by injecting it 
deep into the Earth,

00:03:28.782 --> 00:03:32.437
or by placing it deep 
under the ocean's surface.

00:03:32.437 --> 00:03:36.288
Stripping away coal's negative elements
can happen in three ways.

00:03:36.288 --> 00:03:38.083
First, and most commonly,

00:03:38.083 --> 00:03:39.160
as coal burns,

00:03:39.160 --> 00:03:43.716
the exhaust gas can be mixed 
with a compound called monoethanolamine.

00:03:43.716 --> 00:03:49.172
Like a forceful power-stripping magnet,
this compound bonds to the CO2,

00:03:49.172 --> 00:03:50.936
yanking it out of the gas stream

00:03:50.936 --> 00:03:53.947
so it can be stored 
separately underground.

00:03:53.947 --> 00:03:57.027
Another method is 
to relieve coal of its CO2

00:03:57.027 --> 00:04:01.404
before it even has a chance 
to be released as exhaust.

00:04:01.404 --> 00:04:05.348
In this process, steam and oxygen 
swoop in to the rescue

00:04:05.348 --> 00:04:09.100
to convert coal into a special 
product called syngas,

00:04:09.100 --> 00:04:13.375
made up of carbon monoxide and hydrogen
and some CO2.

00:04:13.375 --> 00:04:15.201
Zap that with some water vapor,

00:04:15.201 --> 00:04:19.258
and the carbon monoxide 
gets converted into carbon dioxide,

00:04:19.258 --> 00:04:20.885
which can be isolated.

00:04:20.885 --> 00:04:24.969
The leftover hydrogen gas is then
used as energy to generate electricity,

00:04:24.969 --> 00:04:26.954
so there's an added bonus.

00:04:26.954 --> 00:04:30.718
A third technique 
exposes coal to pure oxygen,

00:04:30.718 --> 00:04:32.729
instead of burning it in air.

00:04:32.729 --> 00:04:36.877
This creates exhaust gas with higher 
concentrations of carbon dioxide,

00:04:36.877 --> 00:04:40.916
which makes it easy to isolate 
and to banish to the chasms below.

00:04:40.916 --> 00:04:45.637
All this can reduce emissions 
at a power plant by up to 90%,

00:04:45.637 --> 00:04:48.952
but as with any superhero 
struggling with their destructive powers,

00:04:48.952 --> 00:04:52.476
it takes a lot of effort 
to switch over from the dark side.

00:04:52.476 --> 00:04:54.912
So these positive 
pollution-busting forces,

00:04:54.912 --> 00:04:56.493
although they're available,

00:04:56.493 --> 00:04:59.287
have barely been used 
in commercial power plants

00:04:59.287 --> 00:05:01.371
because they cost a lot.

00:05:01.371 --> 00:05:05.487
But ultimately, the bigger problem 
is that in most parts of the world,

00:05:05.487 --> 00:05:10.623
it's still too easy and much cheaper 
to keep emitting carbon dioxide,

00:05:10.623 --> 00:05:14.930
and that makes it tempting 
to completely ignore coal's dark side.

00:05:14.930 --> 00:05:18.995
In this case, the most powerful 
force for good is regulation,

00:05:18.995 --> 00:05:21.983
the rules that can restrict 
the amount of carbon dioxide

00:05:21.983 --> 00:05:23.601
emitted from power plants,

00:05:23.601 --> 00:05:25.680
and make energy companies 
around the world

00:05:25.680 --> 00:05:28.467
wary of what they put into the air.

00:05:28.467 --> 00:05:29.506
Until then,

00:05:29.506 --> 00:05:32.444
every time you turn on a screen 
or flick a light switch,

00:05:32.444 --> 00:05:34.504
coal is lurking in the background,

00:05:34.504 --> 00:05:37.584
carrying its dark powers with it 
wherever it goes.
