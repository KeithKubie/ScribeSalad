00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.000
So the first idea to solve this is just to replace the vote

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:09.000
with the vote concatenated with some random value selected by the voter and kept secret.

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:11.000
So the question is, does this work?

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:14.000
And we're only worried about protecting the voter's identity here.

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:17.000
We're not yet considering the problem of can C fabricate votes at the end.

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:19.000
So the answers are:  Yes.

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:24.000
Only if the eavesdropper cannot intercept messages on both this link and this link,

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:29.000
only if the interceptor can't intercept all the messages along the whole chain,

00:00:29.000 --> 99:59:59.000
and only if the eavesdropper doesn't collude with C.
