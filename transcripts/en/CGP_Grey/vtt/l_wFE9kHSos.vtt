00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.460
The main video is pulling a bit of a trick at this moment.

00:00:02.460 --> 00:00:06.020
The rate the advertisers pay per 1000 views is actually a lot higher than this

00:00:06.020 --> 00:00:09.960
and if you own a YouTube channel you can look at your analytics and you'll see a number

00:00:09.960 --> 00:00:12.220
listed that's much bigger per 1000.

00:00:12.220 --> 00:00:16.380
This is because there are lots of YouTube views where no ad is shown at all.

00:00:16.380 --> 00:00:18.620
If you find that hard to believe it's probably because you're

00:00:18.620 --> 00:00:23.580
in a prime demographic that advertisers want, so you're always seeing ads on YouTube.

00:00:23.580 --> 00:00:26.240
But there are demographics that rarely see ads.

00:00:26.240 --> 00:00:30.980
Plus, YouTube normally doesn't show someone an ad when they first arrive on the site.

00:00:31.180 --> 00:00:35.840
Channels can have 30 or 40%, or as much as 90% of their views play

00:00:35.840 --> 00:00:41.140
without an ad because viewers are in an age or location that fewer advertisers want.

00:00:41.140 --> 00:00:43.960
Or, just fewer advertisers happen to be around.

00:00:43.960 --> 00:00:46.300
But if you make a YouTube channel, the number you really care about

00:00:46.300 --> 00:00:51.140
is the one that's the size of the check that you get divided by your thousands of views.

00:00:51.140 --> 00:00:53.760
This is the number creators compare with each other,

00:00:53.760 --> 00:00:55.760
even though YouTube doesn't really want us to.
