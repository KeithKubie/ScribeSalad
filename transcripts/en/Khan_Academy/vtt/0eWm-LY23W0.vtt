00:00:00.770 --> 00:00:03.827
On your math quiz, you earn
5 points for each question

00:00:03.827 --> 00:00:04.910
that you answer correctly.

00:00:04.910 --> 00:00:08.189
In the table below, x represents
the number of questions

00:00:08.189 --> 00:00:11.337
that you answer correctly, and
y represents the total number

00:00:11.337 --> 00:00:12.920
of points that you
score on your quiz.

00:00:12.920 --> 00:00:13.527
Fair enough?

00:00:13.527 --> 00:00:15.360
The relationship between
these two variables

00:00:15.360 --> 00:00:17.193
can be expressed by the
following equation--

00:00:17.193 --> 00:00:18.540
y is equal to 5x.

00:00:18.540 --> 00:00:21.360
Graph the equation below.

00:00:21.360 --> 00:00:23.360
So you could look at a
couple of your points.

00:00:23.360 --> 00:00:25.568
You could say, well, look,
if I got 0 questions right

00:00:25.568 --> 00:00:27.260
I'm going to have 0 points.

00:00:27.260 --> 00:00:29.010
So you could literally
graph that point--

00:00:29.010 --> 00:00:32.009
if I got 0 questions
right, I get 0 points.

00:00:32.009 --> 00:00:33.550
And then if I get
one question right,

00:00:33.550 --> 00:00:35.430
and the table tells us
that, or we could logically

00:00:35.430 --> 00:00:37.430
think about it, every
question I would get right

00:00:37.430 --> 00:00:39.180
I'm going to get 5 more points.

00:00:39.180 --> 00:00:43.300
So if I get one question right,
I'm going to get 5 more points,

00:00:43.300 --> 00:00:45.170
and we saw that in
our table as well.

00:00:45.170 --> 00:00:48.132
We saw that right over here--
one question, 5 points.

00:00:48.132 --> 00:00:50.090
We could also plot it
two questions, 10 points,

00:00:50.090 --> 00:00:50.631
any of these.

00:00:50.631 --> 00:00:53.730
But you only have to do two
points to define a line.

00:00:53.730 --> 00:00:58.260
So it looks like we
are actually done here.
