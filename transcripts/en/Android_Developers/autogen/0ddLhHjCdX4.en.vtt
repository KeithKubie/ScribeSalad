00:00:00.247 --> 00:00:00.830
 I'm Sebastian. 

00:00:00.830 --> 00:00:03.210
 I work for Football Addicts, 

00:00:03.210 --> 00:00:09.010
 An application company based in Gothenburg, Sweden. 

00:00:09.010 --> 00:00:11.700
 We launched two years ago 

00:00:11.700 --> 00:00:13.830
 Forza Football is called. 

00:00:13.830 --> 00:00:17.830
 It is a consumer application for football. 

00:00:17.830 --> 00:00:20.920
 You can follow your favorite teams and patrols 

00:00:20.920 --> 00:00:23.660
 all over the world. 

00:00:23.660 --> 00:00:26.032
 This is my small agenda, 

00:00:26.032 --> 00:00:27.740
 I will move between the challenges 

00:00:27.740 --> 00:00:34.580
 Which we encountered during the design we changed. 

00:00:34.580 --> 00:00:36.740
 I will then give you some examples 

00:00:36.740 --> 00:00:41.590
 Of the different views to apply before the transfer 

00:00:41.590 --> 00:00:44.640
 To and after multidimensional design. 

00:00:44.640 --> 00:00:46.400
 Well, this is our application, 

00:00:46.400 --> 00:00:49.900
 This was a form of almost a year, 

00:00:49.900 --> 00:00:50.830
 It's a list of matches. 

00:00:50.830 --> 00:00:53.970
 Where you can see all the games that interest you, 

00:00:53.970 --> 00:00:59.710
 It's a very dedicated experience but it's very complicated now. 

00:00:59.710 --> 00:01:03.263
 The largest part of the transport process is the multidimensional design 

00:01:03.263 --> 00:01:04.769
 In the overview. 

00:01:04.769 --> 00:01:07.350
 I think it's a bit hard, 

00:01:07.350 --> 00:01:12.440
 Find results that 

00:01:12.440 --> 00:01:13.870
 Would like to get it from this offer. 

00:01:13.870 --> 00:01:17.660
 It is really hard to get a quick look 

00:01:17.660 --> 00:01:22.010
 On small things, this was 

00:01:22.010 --> 00:01:23.790
 Is what we wanted to change. 

00:01:23.790 --> 00:01:27.610
 Mobility is very important in any application 

00:01:27.610 --> 00:01:31.890
 But we have a lot of content, lots of data and information. 

00:01:31.890 --> 00:01:35.420
 So access to the information you seek 

00:01:35.420 --> 00:01:37.310
 Is important, really important. 

00:01:37.310 --> 00:01:40.050
 So we wanted to get rid of the stacked list. 

00:01:40.050 --> 00:01:42.160
 We have had a side menu for a long time, 

00:01:42.160 --> 00:01:45.800
 Then we felt that we needed to update mobility 

00:01:45.800 --> 00:01:50.290
 Make it smoother and easier to understand. 

00:01:50.290 --> 00:01:55.020
 If you click on what you want, you'll get it right away. 

00:01:55.020 --> 00:01:57.630
 Touch content, 

00:01:57.630 --> 00:02:00.250
 It's important to show the content you're interested in 

00:02:00.250 --> 00:02:04.560
 On the right when using the application. 

00:02:04.560 --> 00:02:06.730
 Well, these are some different screens 

00:02:06.730 --> 00:02:10.800
 Which we had before redesigned. 

00:02:10.800 --> 00:02:14.060
 In the middle here is the team page. 

00:02:14.060 --> 00:02:17.460
 I think it's really hard to - 

00:02:17.460 --> 00:02:21.580
 We created copies of different types of criteria 

00:02:21.580 --> 00:02:22.280
 the design. 

00:02:22.280 --> 00:02:23.910
 Here you can see two of them. 

00:02:23.910 --> 00:02:28.760
 Here we have a switch button inspired by the IOS operating system 

00:02:28.760 --> 00:02:29.700
 I think it is inappropriate. 

00:02:29.700 --> 00:02:31.520
 We have different colors, 

00:02:31.520 --> 00:02:33.420
 We used something like colors to emphasize things 

00:02:33.420 --> 00:02:37.520
 But I do not really know what that meant. 

00:02:37.520 --> 00:02:39.530
 Well, here is the image of the league 

00:02:39.530 --> 00:02:41.230
 With knowledge and everything else. 

00:02:41.230 --> 00:02:44.650
 We wanted to provide a more consistent experience, 

00:02:44.650 --> 00:02:49.320
 This is what we have reached after redesign. 

00:02:49.320 --> 00:02:51.800
 We recognize that this work is still going on, 

00:02:51.800 --> 00:02:54.050
 The redesign work never ends. 

00:02:54.050 --> 00:02:57.450
 Well, we can always improve the application, 

00:02:57.450 --> 00:02:59.540
 But if we focus on the match list, 

00:02:59.540 --> 00:03:05.760
 We strive to make every game appear as important. 

00:03:05.760 --> 00:03:08.460
 As football fans care about the results, 

00:03:08.460 --> 00:03:10.870
 The results must capture attention here. 

00:03:10.870 --> 00:03:15.290
 We tried to reduce the size - we tried to make 

00:03:15.290 --> 00:03:17.410
 Mobility is more stressed. 

00:03:17.410 --> 00:03:19.970
 The appearance of the stacked menu, 

00:03:19.970 --> 00:03:22.080
 Well, we tried everything 

00:03:22.080 --> 00:03:27.140
 Easier to understand and does not hinder you. 

00:03:27.140 --> 00:03:30.250
 And also the pages of teams and periodicals 

00:03:30.250 --> 00:03:34.480
 It's moving now and you can pass it away 

00:03:34.480 --> 00:03:36.970
 If you no longer care. 

00:03:36.970 --> 00:03:40.140
 So it's like dealing with paper pages here, 

00:03:40.140 --> 00:03:43.690
 As well as minimizing the toolbar. 

00:03:43.690 --> 00:03:47.960
 I can place an animation here if you're familiar with Google spreadsheets, 

00:03:47.960 --> 00:03:50.910
 But, I think you understand my intent. 

00:03:50.910 --> 00:03:54.630
 We showed a certain amount of basic content 

00:03:54.630 --> 00:03:56.460
 And basic information about each team. 

00:03:56.460 --> 00:04:01.750
 Thus we have created card-shaped views of everything you think 

00:04:01.750 --> 00:04:03.620
 As important. 

00:04:03.620 --> 00:04:06.280
 However, the main part of the equation, 

00:04:06.280 --> 00:04:07.910
 Is of course what users think is important. 

00:04:07.910 --> 00:04:11.630
 So we need to test this design maybe to trigger some views 

00:04:11.630 --> 00:04:13.100
 The cards are up or down. 

00:04:13.100 --> 00:04:15.850
 What I said, however, is that work is continuing, 

00:04:15.850 --> 00:04:22.070
 We try to use tests as much as possible, 

00:04:22.070 --> 00:04:23.927
 We have just started the AVA test 

00:04:23.927 --> 00:04:24.760
 And things like that. 

00:04:24.760 --> 00:04:26.620
 It is a new subject for us, 

00:04:26.620 --> 00:04:28.810
 But I really admire what 

00:04:28.810 --> 00:04:32.850
 Google is now on design libraries and more. 

00:04:32.850 --> 00:04:35.600
 For example, it took this slide and clicked the toolbar 

00:04:35.600 --> 00:04:40.060
 Two or three months of work 

00:04:40.060 --> 00:04:40.560
 As I remember. 

00:04:40.560 --> 00:04:42.561
 But now can be implemented with a five-line code 

00:04:42.561 --> 00:04:43.560
 Through the new design library. 

00:04:43.560 --> 00:04:49.678
 So thank Google, although this I missed, 

00:04:49.678 --> 00:04:50.670
 Yeah. 

00:04:50.670 --> 00:04:52.460
 I have finished.
