00:00:00.500 --> 00:00:06.950
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:00:06.950 --> 00:00:09.519
- Hello, hello.

00:00:09.519 --> 00:00:10.560
It's good to be with you.

00:00:10.560 --> 00:00:11.754
Hello, everyone.

00:00:14.480 --> 00:00:17.800
Greetings, especially, to
my comrades at Radcliffe.

00:00:17.800 --> 00:00:21.090
There are 45 of
us, give or take,

00:00:21.090 --> 00:00:27.490
from every hill and molehill
of this intellectual farm.

00:00:27.490 --> 00:00:30.400
I'm grateful to my comrades.

00:00:30.400 --> 00:00:32.000
We're like a village
here, and it's

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:34.670
good to be among other
farmers in the field

00:00:34.670 --> 00:00:37.620
of a mind on whom
we can depend, one

00:00:37.620 --> 00:00:42.010
on the other for reassurance,
and sometimes fertilizer.

00:00:44.590 --> 00:00:45.680
Now the year is ending.

00:00:45.680 --> 00:00:47.170
And the crops are high.

00:00:47.170 --> 00:00:50.680
And it's time to bring them in.

00:00:50.680 --> 00:00:53.440
Much gratitude to Radcliffe,
Dean, Associate Dean,

00:00:53.440 --> 00:00:58.210
and staff, for making us feel
supported and welcome here.

00:00:58.210 --> 00:01:00.510
We're made to feel important
beyond the evidence

00:01:00.510 --> 00:01:03.050
of our actual contribution
to the common good.

00:01:06.460 --> 00:01:11.710
Now my mother had a
soft view of the subject

00:01:11.710 --> 00:01:14.820
I want to talk about today.

00:01:14.820 --> 00:01:19.290
She said, "he was the one
with the beautiful name."

00:01:19.290 --> 00:01:30.560
Constant LeCorgne,
Polycarp Constant LeCorgne,

00:01:30.560 --> 00:01:32.925
he used his middle name
because he disliked his first.

00:01:36.620 --> 00:01:40.730
When I was a boy, I lived for
a lot of years in Louisiana,

00:01:40.730 --> 00:01:45.550
down south in New Orleans.

00:01:45.550 --> 00:01:49.250
That's the home of
my mother's family.

00:01:49.250 --> 00:01:51.270
My mother's people have
lived in New Orleans

00:01:51.270 --> 00:01:53.980
for about 200 years.

00:01:53.980 --> 00:01:57.520
My father's family are all from
Charleston, South Carolina,

00:01:57.520 --> 00:02:02.150
on the other side
of the southeast

00:02:02.150 --> 00:02:06.200
where they've lived
for about 300 years.

00:02:06.200 --> 00:02:08.110
I lived with my
family in Charleston

00:02:08.110 --> 00:02:09.500
for part of my childhood.

00:02:09.500 --> 00:02:13.116
And then something happened,
and that was my father died.

00:02:13.116 --> 00:02:16.250
And so my mother picked us up--

00:02:16.250 --> 00:02:18.600
I have one brother,
we were young,

00:02:18.600 --> 00:02:22.650
I wasn't even a teenager-- and
moved us over to New Orleans.

00:02:22.650 --> 00:02:24.150
She wanted to be
close to her people

00:02:24.150 --> 00:02:25.860
because she was alone
and thought to look

00:02:25.860 --> 00:02:27.100
for help raising her boys.

00:02:29.620 --> 00:02:31.440
My mother's family
in New Orleans

00:02:31.440 --> 00:02:33.810
have been and remain
plain people--

00:02:33.810 --> 00:02:39.850
clerks, tradesmen, school
teachers, salesmen, carpenters,

00:02:39.850 --> 00:02:46.750
nurses, nobody at all with a
higher education for 150 years

00:02:46.750 --> 00:02:50.590
until the 1970s.

00:02:50.590 --> 00:02:55.440
So when we arrived, we
moved in with my grandmother

00:02:55.440 --> 00:02:58.110
into her bungalow,
which was raised up

00:02:58.110 --> 00:02:59.945
against the floods that
plagued New Orleans.

00:03:04.470 --> 00:03:06.270
This is my mother on the left.

00:03:06.270 --> 00:03:09.980
That's me sitting on her
lap in the mid 1960s.

00:03:09.980 --> 00:03:13.520
And in the back is my mother's
mother, Edna LeCorgne.

00:03:18.040 --> 00:03:19.580
Living with my
grandmother, also,

00:03:19.580 --> 00:03:22.530
was a woman named Maude,
my grandmother's sister,

00:03:22.530 --> 00:03:23.880
Maude LeCorgne.

00:03:23.880 --> 00:03:25.880
And it was with Aunt
Maude that I first

00:03:25.880 --> 00:03:28.070
learned about the Klansmen.

00:03:31.960 --> 00:03:34.610
Aunt Maude was about 75
when I first paid attention.

00:03:34.610 --> 00:03:35.660
She was a school teacher.

00:03:35.660 --> 00:03:37.609
And she was unmarried,
never married,

00:03:37.609 --> 00:03:39.025
what used to be
called a spinster.

00:03:41.660 --> 00:03:43.460
She wore wire-rimmed glasses.

00:03:43.460 --> 00:03:47.160
She wore her long white hair,
usually, coiled up in a bun

00:03:47.160 --> 00:03:48.700
tight against the
back of her head.

00:03:48.700 --> 00:03:51.690
She had a closet full
of gingham dresses.

00:03:51.690 --> 00:03:55.100
She wore opaque
stockings with the seam

00:03:55.100 --> 00:03:57.120
down the back of the calf.

00:03:57.120 --> 00:04:02.370
She wore heavy black shoes with
a clunky two-inch square heel

00:04:02.370 --> 00:04:07.200
that clattered on the
floor of the bungalow.

00:04:07.200 --> 00:04:10.280
She had pursed lips.

00:04:10.280 --> 00:04:13.650
"Come here, boy, let me
tell you about our people."

00:04:16.950 --> 00:04:18.500
"Aunt Maude, can I
have a Coca-Cola?"

00:04:21.250 --> 00:04:23.220
Aunt Maude was the
family historian.

00:04:23.220 --> 00:04:25.370
Now in every family,
especially in the South,

00:04:25.370 --> 00:04:28.160
there is a keeper of lore.

00:04:28.160 --> 00:04:29.170
She's usually a woman.

00:04:29.170 --> 00:04:33.320
She's usually not married,
either made single

00:04:33.320 --> 00:04:38.460
by divorce, or death,
or never married.

00:04:38.460 --> 00:04:41.050
She gathers in the
stories of all those

00:04:41.050 --> 00:04:42.960
who are no longer with us.

00:04:42.960 --> 00:04:44.540
She makes family trees.

00:04:44.540 --> 00:04:45.835
She pretends to be a writer.

00:04:48.930 --> 00:04:51.890
Aunt Maude was that person.

00:04:51.890 --> 00:04:54.320
"Yes, surely you can
have a Coca-Cola.

00:04:54.320 --> 00:04:57.462
Here, let me tell you about
our people, the LeCorgnes.

00:04:57.462 --> 00:05:02.630
The first one of us to
arrive here in New Orleans

00:05:02.630 --> 00:05:07.500
was Yve LeCorgne, came
from Brittany on the west

00:05:07.500 --> 00:05:09.220
coast of France.

00:05:09.220 --> 00:05:12.170
He was a sailor in
Napoleon's navy.

00:05:15.160 --> 00:05:18.960
And Napoleon, as you may know,
as you will learn in school one

00:05:18.960 --> 00:05:21.700
day, was involved in war
from one end of the world

00:05:21.700 --> 00:05:23.770
to the other.

00:05:23.770 --> 00:05:27.590
And there was an uprising
here at Saint-Domingue.

00:05:27.590 --> 00:05:31.762
That's that place--
they now call it Haiti.

00:05:31.762 --> 00:05:34.940
And Napoleon sent a
flotilla of warships.

00:05:34.940 --> 00:05:36.290
And Yve was on one of them.

00:05:36.290 --> 00:05:38.910
And those ships arrived
in the Caribbean.

00:05:38.910 --> 00:05:42.210
And for some reason, one of the
ships came up to New Orleans.

00:05:42.210 --> 00:05:44.450
Yve got off the ship
and never got back on.

00:05:49.110 --> 00:05:50.762
Well Yve was about 28--

00:05:50.762 --> 00:05:51.720
are you listening boy--

00:05:56.070 --> 00:05:57.750
when he arrived in New Orleans.

00:05:57.750 --> 00:06:00.330
And he found a wife,
19-year-old woman

00:06:00.330 --> 00:06:03.910
named Marguerite Zeringue.

00:06:03.910 --> 00:06:08.890
The Zeringues were a
prosperous sugar planting

00:06:08.890 --> 00:06:12.496
family from Bayou Lafourche.

00:06:12.496 --> 00:06:13.870
But they weren't
that prosperous.

00:06:13.870 --> 00:06:16.590
And they were somewhat
in decline, slow decline.

00:06:16.590 --> 00:06:18.370
So they consented,
or condescended,

00:06:18.370 --> 00:06:22.460
to allow Marguerite to
marry Yve who'd washed up.

00:06:26.620 --> 00:06:29.880
And when they did marry, they
moved into that little creole

00:06:29.880 --> 00:06:34.437
cottage on Dauphine Street,
down in the French Quarter.

00:06:34.437 --> 00:06:36.770
Now they didn't call it the
French Quarter at that time,

00:06:36.770 --> 00:06:38.720
you know.

00:06:38.720 --> 00:06:42.730
It was this, merely,
le Vieux Carre.

00:06:42.730 --> 00:06:43.730
It was the Old Quarter.

00:06:43.730 --> 00:06:45.130
It was where all the
French people lived.

00:06:45.130 --> 00:06:46.338
And these people were French.

00:06:46.338 --> 00:06:49.480
Everybody's speaking French
in the LeCorgne household.

00:06:49.480 --> 00:06:52.740
We were French, you see.

00:06:52.740 --> 00:06:56.660
And despite the fact that the
Americans had bought Louisiana,

00:06:56.660 --> 00:06:58.310
we did not stop speaking French.

00:06:58.310 --> 00:07:00.528
We remained French
for another century.

00:07:05.170 --> 00:07:07.750
So they had their
five children there.

00:07:07.750 --> 00:07:09.260
And among them was
my grandfather,

00:07:09.260 --> 00:07:13.110
Constant LeCorgne,
Constant LeCorgne.

00:07:13.110 --> 00:07:15.230
He was a Redeemer.

00:07:15.230 --> 00:07:18.170
Do you know about
the Redemption?"

00:07:18.170 --> 00:07:19.970
"No, ma'am.

00:07:19.970 --> 00:07:22.307
Can I have another Coca-Cola?"

00:07:25.109 --> 00:07:28.050
"The Redemption, that
was after the Civil War,

00:07:28.050 --> 00:07:31.230
when the colored people
had taken over the state.

00:07:31.230 --> 00:07:34.120
They started businesses.

00:07:34.120 --> 00:07:37.870
They were acting as though
everything was theirs.

00:07:37.870 --> 00:07:39.430
They were voting.

00:07:39.430 --> 00:07:42.870
The Redemption was after that
time they call Reconstruction,

00:07:42.870 --> 00:07:46.330
that awful time.

00:07:46.330 --> 00:07:48.250
Now Reconstruction
was not when the South

00:07:48.250 --> 00:07:50.150
tried to build itself
up again after the war

00:07:50.150 --> 00:07:51.280
between the states.

00:07:51.280 --> 00:07:53.060
It was not when the
houses were rebuilt

00:07:53.060 --> 00:07:56.010
after the Yankees burned them.

00:07:56.010 --> 00:07:58.220
No, Reconstruction was when
they put colored people

00:07:58.220 --> 00:08:01.170
in the seat of power.

00:08:01.170 --> 00:08:08.730
The Redemption was the time
when people resisted that.

00:08:08.730 --> 00:08:12.110
And so my grandfather,
Constant, he was a Redeemer.

00:08:12.110 --> 00:08:15.460
He wanted to restore white rule.

00:08:15.460 --> 00:08:18.860
And he got tied up
that White League."

00:08:18.860 --> 00:08:23.650
"Aunt Maude, what is
The White League?"

00:08:23.650 --> 00:08:26.880
"The White League-- the only
difference between The White

00:08:26.880 --> 00:08:31.112
League and the Ku Klux is that
the Ku Klux were secretive.

00:08:31.112 --> 00:08:33.390
What the Ku Klux liked
to do in secret at night,

00:08:33.390 --> 00:08:35.740
The White League did out
in the open during the day.

00:08:38.350 --> 00:08:41.549
And thank God for
The White League

00:08:41.549 --> 00:08:44.931
because they put the Negro
out of the seat of power.

00:08:44.931 --> 00:08:49.700
Can you imagine the Negro
with authority here?"

00:08:52.940 --> 00:08:55.500
And so it was from Aunt
Maude, the spinster

00:08:55.500 --> 00:08:57.440
and family historian
that I first

00:08:57.440 --> 00:09:01.300
learned about our Klansman.

00:09:01.300 --> 00:09:01.930
I grew up.

00:09:01.930 --> 00:09:06.290
I put the story of
the Redemption away.

00:09:06.290 --> 00:09:08.780
I went to college,
finished, ended up

00:09:08.780 --> 00:09:10.050
with a path in journalism.

00:09:10.050 --> 00:09:13.250
And then I started
writing books.

00:09:13.250 --> 00:09:17.100
30 years passed
and I find myself

00:09:17.100 --> 00:09:20.480
in possession of Aunt
Maude's notebooks.

00:09:20.480 --> 00:09:24.680
She has died and I've inherited
them, her family trees,

00:09:24.680 --> 00:09:28.070
her marriage licenses, and
her death records, and wills,

00:09:28.070 --> 00:09:33.970
and stories written down about
the LeCorgnes and their people.

00:09:33.970 --> 00:09:34.750
I put them away.

00:09:34.750 --> 00:09:37.650
I don't look at them because
I'm afraid they contain

00:09:37.650 --> 00:09:38.930
toxic tales of the Ku Klux.

00:09:41.950 --> 00:09:45.960
Then comes the day
a few years ago

00:09:45.960 --> 00:09:49.390
when Trayvon Martin, a
17-year-old kid in Seminole

00:09:49.390 --> 00:09:53.270
County, Florida, was
ambushed and shot

00:09:53.270 --> 00:09:57.250
by a vigilante named
George Zimmerman.

00:09:57.250 --> 00:09:58.200
And this shakes me.

00:09:58.200 --> 00:10:01.270
And I think of the Redeemer.

00:10:01.270 --> 00:10:05.410
Then comes the day when
Michael Brown, the 18-year-old

00:10:05.410 --> 00:10:08.060
in Ferguson, Missouri, is
shot dead in the street

00:10:08.060 --> 00:10:15.390
by the police, an event that
reverberates for a year.

00:10:15.390 --> 00:10:19.550
Then comes the day when Tamir
Rice, the 12-year-old boy

00:10:19.550 --> 00:10:21.850
in Cleveland, Ohio, was
shot dead in a playground

00:10:21.850 --> 00:10:23.605
under a jungle
gym by the police.

00:10:26.700 --> 00:10:29.390
And finally comes the day
when a white supremacist

00:10:29.390 --> 00:10:34.070
named Dylann Roof, in
Charleston, South Carolina,

00:10:34.070 --> 00:10:39.040
walks into a church,
Emmanuel AME Church,

00:10:39.040 --> 00:10:41.690
and into a prayer
meeting where people

00:10:41.690 --> 00:10:45.200
are discussing the parable
of the sower from Mark.

00:10:45.200 --> 00:10:48.910
So, "as ye sow,
so shall ye reap."

00:10:48.910 --> 00:10:51.890
And he shoots nine people dead.

00:10:54.750 --> 00:10:57.150
So I open Aunt Maude's files.

00:10:57.150 --> 00:11:02.620
And I decide to look
for the Klansman, which

00:11:02.620 --> 00:11:06.360
is, at this point, merely
a slice of oral tradition.

00:11:09.050 --> 00:11:13.740
When I start, it is a story that
is unburdened by much research.

00:11:13.740 --> 00:11:16.060
But today, having
spent 18 months

00:11:16.060 --> 00:11:18.590
in and out of the
archives, I have

00:11:18.590 --> 00:11:19.940
a sense of the paper trail.

00:11:24.840 --> 00:11:28.160
The story I'm developing, here
at Harvard, is a family memoir.

00:11:28.160 --> 00:11:30.725
But it is not the
sentimental, gauzy kind.

00:11:34.120 --> 00:11:37.810
Polycarp Constant LeCorgne,
a person long dead,

00:11:37.810 --> 00:11:41.040
his life a quilt of family
lore and public records,

00:11:41.040 --> 00:11:42.990
was a man white
Southerners once cheered

00:11:42.990 --> 00:11:46.790
as a savior along with
thousands of other Redeemers

00:11:46.790 --> 00:11:49.360
in the first generation
of the Ku Klux.

00:11:49.360 --> 00:11:52.170
He was a tradesman and
father of five who became,

00:11:52.170 --> 00:11:56.290
in a way, a founding father
when he took up with Klan groups

00:11:56.290 --> 00:11:57.820
in Louisiana.

00:11:57.820 --> 00:11:59.790
LeCorgne's life
and choices helped

00:11:59.790 --> 00:12:03.790
to cement white over black
during a time, Reconstruction,

00:12:03.790 --> 00:12:06.470
when white domination
was under threat.

00:12:06.470 --> 00:12:08.560
After the Klan won
the race battles

00:12:08.560 --> 00:12:12.120
of the post Civil War South
and the Jim Crow caste system

00:12:12.120 --> 00:12:16.000
was locked down, everyone
knew that restoring whiteness

00:12:16.000 --> 00:12:18.130
to power, following
its years of retreat,

00:12:18.130 --> 00:12:21.210
was the movement's
lasting achievement.

00:12:21.210 --> 00:12:24.650
And perhaps, this marginal
man touches the fingertips

00:12:24.650 --> 00:12:27.150
of current politics.

00:12:27.150 --> 00:12:30.190
Perhaps his life makes
visible the class resentments,

00:12:30.190 --> 00:12:33.340
the desire for ethnic
purity, and the free floating

00:12:33.340 --> 00:12:37.210
fear that underlie
extremes of whiteness.

00:12:37.210 --> 00:12:39.530
It may be possible
to argue that some

00:12:39.530 --> 00:12:42.840
of the hostility of white
identity in the present

00:12:42.840 --> 00:12:47.840
can be traced to sources in
the first years of the Ku Klux.

00:12:47.840 --> 00:12:51.410
An aggressive form of
whiteness has been resurgent.

00:12:51.410 --> 00:12:54.820
It moved into the open when the
Ku Klux Klan and race speech

00:12:54.820 --> 00:12:57.315
streamed into the 2016 election.

00:12:57.315 --> 00:12:59.770
It surfaces naked
racism with the naming

00:12:59.770 --> 00:13:03.890
of the alt-right movement
and crested, perhaps,

00:13:03.890 --> 00:13:06.100
in the white-lash
that helped to sweep

00:13:06.100 --> 00:13:08.500
a new president into office.

00:13:08.500 --> 00:13:12.440
I am trying to recount the birth
hours of white supremacy using

00:13:12.440 --> 00:13:14.100
the experience of
a guerrilla fighter

00:13:14.100 --> 00:13:16.640
who battled it into the world.

00:13:16.640 --> 00:13:19.820
I am trying to decide whether
more than 100 years ago, one

00:13:19.820 --> 00:13:25.340
man and his gangs lit
fires that still burn.

00:13:25.340 --> 00:13:28.650
The Ku Klux Klan arose
throughout the South in 1867,

00:13:28.650 --> 00:13:30.710
soon after the Civil War.

00:13:30.710 --> 00:13:33.780
But in Louisiana, the
Klan used other names,

00:13:33.780 --> 00:13:36.050
the Knights of the
White Camellia,

00:13:36.050 --> 00:13:39.860
The White League, The Innocents.

00:13:39.860 --> 00:13:42.220
Constant LeCorgne fought
with the Knights of the White

00:13:42.220 --> 00:13:44.365
Camellia and The White League.

00:13:44.365 --> 00:13:47.850
The Ku Klux Klan
and their comrades

00:13:47.850 --> 00:13:51.020
are the bogeyman of
American history,

00:13:51.020 --> 00:13:55.350
everyone's first choice for
evil, ignorance, and hatred.

00:13:55.350 --> 00:13:58.880
But as with other villains,
people know them through image

00:13:58.880 --> 00:14:02.250
and legend, the torch light
rallies of hooded men--

00:14:02.250 --> 00:14:04.660
shorthand for
Southern depravity--

00:14:04.660 --> 00:14:06.410
supply the imagery.

00:14:06.410 --> 00:14:09.640
The 1915 D. W. Griffith
film about the Klan,

00:14:09.640 --> 00:14:13.280
Birth of a Nation,
provides the black legend.

00:14:13.280 --> 00:14:15.370
I want to name what
the Klan originally

00:14:15.370 --> 00:14:18.500
did through one man
that actually did it--

00:14:18.500 --> 00:14:22.510
the street battles, and night
riding, the banquet of violence

00:14:22.510 --> 00:14:25.060
that made people like my
great-great-grandfather

00:14:25.060 --> 00:14:29.710
infamous in his own lifetime.

00:14:29.710 --> 00:14:32.960
Early Klansmen, like Constant
LeCorgne, were, in their way,

00:14:32.960 --> 00:14:36.530
the original authors
of extreme whiteness.

00:14:36.530 --> 00:14:38.270
They did not write
its theory, which

00:14:38.270 --> 00:14:42.990
grew up within universities
during LeCorgne's lifetime

00:14:42.990 --> 00:14:45.580
as scientific racism.

00:14:45.580 --> 00:14:48.970
Instead, the Ku Klux
devised its practice,

00:14:48.970 --> 00:14:53.490
intimidation of non-whites,
menacing gang rallies,

00:14:53.490 --> 00:14:56.840
exclusive claims to economic
and political spoils,

00:14:56.840 --> 00:14:59.440
and targeted violence.

00:14:59.440 --> 00:15:01.390
In the aftermath of
the November elections,

00:15:01.390 --> 00:15:03.450
it is possible to see
the white vote that

00:15:03.450 --> 00:15:05.120
flooded to the
Republicans, not only

00:15:05.120 --> 00:15:08.900
as an expression of working
class insecurity, but also

00:15:08.900 --> 00:15:13.210
as a clamoring for
a kind of whiteness.

00:15:13.210 --> 00:15:15.760
And during the first months
of a new administration,

00:15:15.760 --> 00:15:18.960
it is possible to see
politics that are remotely,

00:15:18.960 --> 00:15:22.570
but persuasively, moved
by feelings of entitlement

00:15:22.570 --> 00:15:26.910
that find harmony
with some of the deeds

00:15:26.910 --> 00:15:29.240
I'm about to describe.

00:15:29.240 --> 00:15:31.650
Constant LeCorgne
was born in 1832

00:15:31.650 --> 00:15:33.510
to a French family
in New Orleans.

00:15:33.510 --> 00:15:35.470
He is the second of three sons.

00:15:35.470 --> 00:15:38.680
His parents give his older
brother the education,

00:15:38.680 --> 00:15:40.750
and Constant goes into a trade.

00:15:40.750 --> 00:15:45.130
He grows up a small, thin
man, nervous and alert,

00:15:45.130 --> 00:15:49.850
sharp features, skinny nose,
beautiful hands, an underbite,

00:15:49.850 --> 00:15:52.890
and a furrowed brow, a
long wave of dark hair,

00:15:52.890 --> 00:15:54.970
which turned white early.

00:15:54.970 --> 00:15:58.180
As a cistern maker, he
built the wooden casks

00:15:58.180 --> 00:16:01.390
that stood in the yards of
most houses in New Orleans

00:16:01.390 --> 00:16:03.690
where they held drinking water.

00:16:03.690 --> 00:16:11.060
At 24, in 1856, Constant marries
Gabrielle Duchemin, age 19,

00:16:11.060 --> 00:16:13.890
an orphan of French descent
from the Caribbean island

00:16:13.890 --> 00:16:15.290
of Martinique.

00:16:15.290 --> 00:16:18.410
In 1860, as the
Civil War approaches,

00:16:18.410 --> 00:16:21.000
Constant is a carpenter
living in a rented

00:16:21.000 --> 00:16:25.750
house with his wife, Gabrielle,
and their two children

00:16:25.750 --> 00:16:31.510
in this neighborhood, at the
time a suburb of New Orleans,

00:16:31.510 --> 00:16:33.800
called Bouligny.

00:16:33.800 --> 00:16:35.460
His parents are dead.

00:16:35.460 --> 00:16:37.410
His mother, during
her last years,

00:16:37.410 --> 00:16:41.420
had sold her rice
farm and its people--

00:16:41.420 --> 00:16:45.540
she was a slave holder with
eight enslaved people--

00:16:45.540 --> 00:16:48.450
and divided the proceeds
among her children.

00:16:48.450 --> 00:16:51.050
Constant and Gabrielle
received $500

00:16:51.050 --> 00:16:55.260
and two enslaved people,
35-year-old Ovide

00:16:55.260 --> 00:16:57.880
and 24-year-old Polly.

00:16:57.880 --> 00:17:01.240
In 1861, just before the
first shots of the Civil War,

00:17:01.240 --> 00:17:06.670
the couple sells Ovide like
real estate for $1,000.

00:17:06.670 --> 00:17:08.670
They knew Louisiana would fight.

00:17:08.670 --> 00:17:10.460
And they wanted to
liquidate their biggest

00:17:10.460 --> 00:17:13.200
asset in case
slaves became free,

00:17:13.200 --> 00:17:15.693
robbing them of their windfall.

00:17:15.693 --> 00:17:17.109
They would not
move quickly enough

00:17:17.109 --> 00:17:21.150
to sell Polly, who would,
indeed, soon become free.

00:17:21.150 --> 00:17:22.930
At the start of the
war of secession,

00:17:22.930 --> 00:17:26.000
Constant enlists in
a Confederate company

00:17:26.000 --> 00:17:27.524
and heads for Virginia.

00:17:27.524 --> 00:17:30.940
But the unit falls
apart in a mutiny.

00:17:30.940 --> 00:17:35.670
And he deserts and makes
his way home to Louisiana.

00:17:35.670 --> 00:17:38.810
When Union forces stream up
the Mississippi and occupy New

00:17:38.810 --> 00:17:41.280
Orleans, he flees,
again, leaving

00:17:41.280 --> 00:17:43.330
Gabrielle and the children.

00:17:43.330 --> 00:17:45.720
"He walked north up
the Mississippi levee

00:17:45.720 --> 00:17:48.530
some 50 miles," said my
aunt, Maude LeCorgne.

00:17:48.530 --> 00:17:51.030
When he reached
Confederate lines,

00:17:51.030 --> 00:17:55.890
he joined another unit, the
14th Trans Mississippi Regiment,

00:17:55.890 --> 00:17:59.170
and fought for the
rest of the war.

00:17:59.170 --> 00:18:03.610
In summer 1865, after the
truce, after the assassination

00:18:03.610 --> 00:18:06.850
of Lincoln, he comes home to
New Orleans sick, exhausted,

00:18:06.850 --> 00:18:08.410
and bitter.

00:18:08.410 --> 00:18:10.930
He arrived in a city
"full of carpetbaggers

00:18:10.930 --> 00:18:14.720
and with the Negroes
twice as numerous."

00:18:14.720 --> 00:18:18.440
Now with three children, he
found his livelihood wrecked.

00:18:18.440 --> 00:18:21.560
Louisiana was occupied
by the US Army.

00:18:21.560 --> 00:18:25.230
New Orleans was crowded
with black freed people.

00:18:25.230 --> 00:18:29.420
And Yankees and
thieves ran everything.

00:18:29.420 --> 00:18:35.130
He felt himself a victim, saw
the new order as anathema,

00:18:35.130 --> 00:18:37.370
and descended into resentment.

00:18:37.370 --> 00:18:41.400
The government was pro-Negro
and colored people actually

00:18:41.400 --> 00:18:45.320
held office, a bona
fide perversion.

00:18:45.320 --> 00:18:48.635
"Imagine a Negro in the White
House," said Aunt Maude.

00:18:51.810 --> 00:18:55.980
This is a guide to New Orleans
published during this time,

00:18:55.980 --> 00:18:59.040
called Zachary's Guide.

00:18:59.040 --> 00:19:00.430
Reconstruction came.

00:19:00.430 --> 00:19:03.510
Reconstruction was the
name of the first attempt

00:19:03.510 --> 00:19:07.430
to remake the US as a
racially mixed democracy.

00:19:07.430 --> 00:19:10.120
To some, not least to
four million ex-slaves,

00:19:10.120 --> 00:19:13.480
it meant power sharing with
whites, possibly even wealth

00:19:13.480 --> 00:19:17.310
sharing, and somewhere in the
distance, shared humanity.

00:19:17.310 --> 00:19:21.640
These fantastical ideas,
called Radical Reconstruction

00:19:21.640 --> 00:19:23.320
by their millions
of white opponents,

00:19:23.320 --> 00:19:28.350
met mass obstruction and
popular violence defiance.

00:19:28.350 --> 00:19:31.140
Constant took the
extreme step and joined

00:19:31.140 --> 00:19:32.570
the armed resistance.

00:19:32.570 --> 00:19:33.990
He became a
guerrilla fighter who

00:19:33.990 --> 00:19:38.860
wanted to return the
South to white rule.

00:19:38.860 --> 00:19:41.690
He became a Klansman,
one of the foot soldiers,

00:19:41.690 --> 00:19:45.970
not a Grand Dragon or a Hydra,
to use titles from the first Ku

00:19:45.970 --> 00:19:48.340
Klux precepts.

00:19:48.340 --> 00:19:52.310
The Ku Klux movement
started in Tennessee in 1866

00:19:52.310 --> 00:19:55.400
as a former Confederate
general named Nathan Bedford

00:19:55.400 --> 00:19:58.350
Forrest led the initial
night raids and terror

00:19:58.350 --> 00:20:00.610
strikes against black
people and against whites

00:20:00.610 --> 00:20:02.950
who supported Reconstruction.

00:20:02.950 --> 00:20:05.100
The tactics of these
gangs spread quickly.

00:20:05.100 --> 00:20:08.060
And by 1867, Klan
raiders were operating

00:20:08.060 --> 00:20:10.410
in most counties of the south.

00:20:10.410 --> 00:20:14.930
The name Ku Klux derives from
the Greek, kyklos, or circle,

00:20:14.930 --> 00:20:18.360
and gangs as everyone
knows sometimes dressed

00:20:18.360 --> 00:20:20.400
in costume and mask.

00:20:20.400 --> 00:20:22.410
Klansman made a
cult of disguise,

00:20:22.410 --> 00:20:25.600
wearing robes and hoods
to avoid identification

00:20:25.600 --> 00:20:27.760
by the Army occupiers.

00:20:27.760 --> 00:20:30.600
Klansman also knew their
victims personally and preferred

00:20:30.600 --> 00:20:33.150
to torment them anonymously.

00:20:33.150 --> 00:20:37.960
The first major explosion in New
Orleans occurred in July 1866.

00:20:37.960 --> 00:20:43.600
And circumstantial evidence
puts Constant LeCorgne there.

00:20:43.600 --> 00:20:46.860
At the Mechanics Institute,
a meeting hall for tradesman,

00:20:46.860 --> 00:20:49.790
during a convention to
agitate for the black vote,

00:20:49.790 --> 00:20:53.630
an assault of Klan rage
leaves 40 black people dead,

00:20:53.630 --> 00:20:56.170
perhaps many more.

00:20:56.170 --> 00:20:58.180
An early disguise of
the White Brigades

00:20:58.180 --> 00:21:00.580
was the costume of fireman.

00:21:00.580 --> 00:21:04.300
Volunteer fire companies
were overstaffed, and armed,

00:21:04.300 --> 00:21:08.320
and made up of entire
Confederate companies.

00:21:08.320 --> 00:21:11.800
Constant's was Home
Hook and Ladder,

00:21:11.800 --> 00:21:15.570
made up of his former Company
C in the 14th Regiment.

00:21:15.570 --> 00:21:17.430
Home Hook and Ladder
was on the scene

00:21:17.430 --> 00:21:19.990
to break up the meeting
about the black vote

00:21:19.990 --> 00:21:22.360
and then the shooting started.

00:21:22.360 --> 00:21:24.420
During the next
eight years, evidence

00:21:24.420 --> 00:21:27.860
shows LeCorgne and perhaps
2,000 others in the state,

00:21:27.860 --> 00:21:31.140
raided, marched,
and beat people.

00:21:31.140 --> 00:21:34.310
Some gangs assassinated
black leaders.

00:21:34.310 --> 00:21:40.050
There was night riding,
whippings, and ambush killings.

00:21:40.050 --> 00:21:42.930
According to court records,
an attempted Klan coup

00:21:42.930 --> 00:21:46.490
is among the incidents in which
my great-great-grandfather

00:21:46.490 --> 00:21:48.770
found his claim to glory.

00:21:48.770 --> 00:21:52.360
In March, 1873,
after an election,

00:21:52.360 --> 00:21:56.340
LeCorgne joined a putsch
against the state government.

00:21:56.340 --> 00:21:58.780
At home that night before
leaving for the action,

00:21:58.780 --> 00:22:02.620
he said goodbye to his wife,
Gabrielle, and their four

00:22:02.620 --> 00:22:05.230
children, all younger than
12, because he did not

00:22:05.230 --> 00:22:07.320
expect to return.

00:22:07.320 --> 00:22:10.150
In the night time attack,
LeCorgne and an armed gang

00:22:10.150 --> 00:22:14.540
of 20 surrounded a police depot
in New Orleans and shot it up,

00:22:14.540 --> 00:22:15.950
seized the building.

00:22:15.950 --> 00:22:18.870
Theirs was one fork of
a two-pronged mission.

00:22:18.870 --> 00:22:21.320
A second group stormed
the city's main armory

00:22:21.320 --> 00:22:23.620
but failed to overcome it.

00:22:23.620 --> 00:22:25.530
LeCorgne's gang
held its position.

00:22:25.530 --> 00:22:28.770
And the standoff ensued for
days with the military camped

00:22:28.770 --> 00:22:30.210
nearby.

00:22:30.210 --> 00:22:32.870
If the plan could bring down
the Louisiana government, even

00:22:32.870 --> 00:22:36.030
for a week, then the US
Army, which shored up

00:22:36.030 --> 00:22:39.510
the new and precarious civil
rights laws could be forced

00:22:39.510 --> 00:22:44.230
to withdraw from the state and
white rule might be taken back.

00:22:44.230 --> 00:22:47.100
The army stormed the
building and two were killed.

00:22:47.100 --> 00:22:48.680
LeCorgne and the
others were charged

00:22:48.680 --> 00:22:52.450
with treason and with
violating the Ku Klux Klan Act.

00:22:52.450 --> 00:22:55.000
In Washington,
Congress had hoped

00:22:55.000 --> 00:22:58.120
it's 1871 Klan Act
would stamp out

00:22:58.120 --> 00:23:00.330
the white gangs in the South.

00:23:00.330 --> 00:23:02.610
The Klan penalty was five years.

00:23:02.610 --> 00:23:05.460
The treason penalty was hanging.

00:23:05.460 --> 00:23:07.430
LeCorgne was not the
only one in the family

00:23:07.430 --> 00:23:09.060
who fought for white rule.

00:23:09.060 --> 00:23:11.640
His brother-in-law,
his nephew, and several

00:23:11.640 --> 00:23:16.180
of his French cousins played
greater or lesser roles.

00:23:16.180 --> 00:23:17.950
In the treason case,
the gallows were

00:23:17.950 --> 00:23:20.420
being discussed when a
sympathetic white judge

00:23:20.420 --> 00:23:24.390
dismissed all counts, freeing
LeCorgne and his conspirators.

00:23:24.390 --> 00:23:28.040
He returned to the
street and to the fight.

00:23:28.040 --> 00:23:31.380
Before the Klan coup, he had
belonged to a different group,

00:23:31.380 --> 00:23:33.160
the so-called
Knights of the White

00:23:33.160 --> 00:23:40.350
Camellia led by a family friend
named Alcibiades DeBlanc.

00:23:40.350 --> 00:23:42.780
The aim of the Knights
was to reverse black gains

00:23:42.780 --> 00:23:47.240
since Emancipation by
any means necessary.

00:23:47.240 --> 00:23:53.940
Between 1867 and 1869, their
attacks left 1,750 people dead

00:23:53.940 --> 00:23:57.810
or wounded in Louisiana,
90% of them black.

00:23:57.810 --> 00:24:01.620
The Knights also
generated racist dogma.

00:24:01.620 --> 00:24:03.670
LeCorgne and other
men who joined

00:24:03.670 --> 00:24:06.120
the Knights went
through an initiation

00:24:06.120 --> 00:24:08.570
held by torchlight
at night where

00:24:08.570 --> 00:24:11.310
they voiced a supremacist oath.

00:24:11.310 --> 00:24:16.520
This is a newspaper in
the Houghton Library,

00:24:16.520 --> 00:24:22.880
which has some interesting
things pertinent to this story.

00:24:22.880 --> 00:24:25.880
The oath, "I am attached
to the Order of the Knights

00:24:25.880 --> 00:24:27.460
of the White Camellia.

00:24:27.460 --> 00:24:30.380
The Order grows on the
mountain known as Caucasus.

00:24:30.380 --> 00:24:33.500
I do solemnly swear
to maintain and defend

00:24:33.500 --> 00:24:35.400
the social and
political superiority

00:24:35.400 --> 00:24:37.950
of the white race
on this continent,

00:24:37.950 --> 00:24:41.420
always and in all places to
observe a marked distinction

00:24:41.420 --> 00:24:44.030
between the white
and African races,

00:24:44.030 --> 00:24:45.870
and to protect
and defend persons

00:24:45.870 --> 00:24:48.930
of the white race in their
lives, rights, and property

00:24:48.930 --> 00:24:51.280
against the encroachments
and aggressions

00:24:51.280 --> 00:24:54.250
of an inferior race."

00:24:54.250 --> 00:24:57.040
This kind of language, taken
from one of the earliest Klan

00:24:57.040 --> 00:25:01.230
creeds, allows one to
trace a chain of ideas

00:25:01.230 --> 00:25:04.930
that reaches from 150 years
ago and stretches down

00:25:04.930 --> 00:25:06.730
through the generations.

00:25:06.730 --> 00:25:11.180
It is a genealogy that wraps
around one Klansman's life

00:25:11.180 --> 00:25:14.360
and spools out, forming
a dotted and irregular

00:25:14.360 --> 00:25:17.460
line that runs to the present.

00:25:17.460 --> 00:25:19.550
Are the activities
of The White League

00:25:19.550 --> 00:25:23.490
and the Knights of the White
Camellia relevant today?

00:25:23.490 --> 00:25:25.370
It may be possible.

00:25:25.370 --> 00:25:27.470
These were murderous militias.

00:25:27.470 --> 00:25:30.530
But occasionally, they
generated statements of purpose

00:25:30.530 --> 00:25:33.050
in which they called for
a strong and dominant

00:25:33.050 --> 00:25:35.800
white racial identity.

00:25:35.800 --> 00:25:37.460
During the past
year, we have heard

00:25:37.460 --> 00:25:39.470
on the lips of a
few in public life

00:25:39.470 --> 00:25:44.080
the explicit desire for an
ethno-state, a country made

00:25:44.080 --> 00:25:45.890
safe for the majority.

00:25:45.890 --> 00:25:48.080
And we have heard
the coded speech

00:25:48.080 --> 00:25:53.450
of some who would have us
make America white again.

00:25:53.450 --> 00:25:55.540
The Knights of the White
Camellia as well as

00:25:55.540 --> 00:25:59.820
its successor, The White
League, LeCorgne's third gang,

00:25:59.820 --> 00:26:02.060
saw themselves as
freedom fighters

00:26:02.060 --> 00:26:04.090
on the side of justice.

00:26:04.090 --> 00:26:09.900
In 1874, LeCorgne and 2,000
white league fighters--

00:26:09.900 --> 00:26:14.410
they had swelled from a fugitive
minority into a mass brigade--

00:26:14.410 --> 00:26:17.550
staged another coup,
this time successful.

00:26:17.550 --> 00:26:20.700
On September 14, in
the so-called battle

00:26:20.700 --> 00:26:24.630
of Canal Street, the Ku Klux
toppled the interracial state

00:26:24.630 --> 00:26:25.610
government.

00:26:25.610 --> 00:26:29.050
LeCorgne was badly
wounded in the clash.

00:26:29.050 --> 00:26:33.720
He had his head split open,
says family tradition.

00:26:33.720 --> 00:26:36.410
But The White League held
Louisiana's capital building

00:26:36.410 --> 00:26:37.600
for a week.

00:26:37.600 --> 00:26:40.190
Though the army
again took power,

00:26:40.190 --> 00:26:42.630
the Klansmen knew they
had lost this battle

00:26:42.630 --> 00:26:44.150
and yet won the war.

00:26:44.150 --> 00:26:46.730
US troops soon
withdrew from Louisiana

00:26:46.730 --> 00:26:48.120
and from the rest of the South.

00:26:48.120 --> 00:26:51.620
And by 1876, a white
monopoly was again

00:26:51.620 --> 00:26:53.890
taking shape in the region.

00:26:53.890 --> 00:26:57.690
It was the beginning of
100 years of Jim Crow,

00:26:57.690 --> 00:26:59.195
the system of color caste.

00:27:02.100 --> 00:27:06.285
Constant LeCorgne died
in 1886 of malaria.

00:27:06.285 --> 00:27:08.580
He left sons who
became carpenters

00:27:08.580 --> 00:27:11.620
like their father, daughters
who mothered or taught school.

00:27:11.620 --> 00:27:14.650
He left grandchildren,
including my grandmother, Edna,

00:27:14.650 --> 00:27:19.640
and her sister, Maude, proud
daughters of tradition.

00:27:19.640 --> 00:27:24.230
Six years after his death,
not far from the family house,

00:27:24.230 --> 00:27:27.640
a colored man named Homer
Plessy boarded a white train

00:27:27.640 --> 00:27:31.220
car in a staged act
of civil disobedience.

00:27:31.220 --> 00:27:33.560
Plessy and a group
of activists wanted

00:27:33.560 --> 00:27:36.190
to challenge the
barriers of segregation.

00:27:36.190 --> 00:27:37.570
He was arrested.

00:27:37.570 --> 00:27:41.080
And the Supreme Court decision
in Plessy versus Ferguson

00:27:41.080 --> 00:27:43.190
drew the bright line
of separate but equal

00:27:43.190 --> 00:27:46.110
between white and
non-white, setting in law

00:27:46.110 --> 00:27:49.070
the stratification that LeCorgne
had fought in the street

00:27:49.070 --> 00:27:51.330
to establish.

00:27:51.330 --> 00:27:53.400
After the Plessy
case, black people

00:27:53.400 --> 00:27:56.400
were not entitled to
most public space,

00:27:56.400 --> 00:28:01.540
nor most education,
nor most housing.

00:28:01.540 --> 00:28:04.010
Simultaneously, a
surge of vagrancy laws

00:28:04.010 --> 00:28:07.060
and the development
of convict leasing--

00:28:07.060 --> 00:28:10.220
a slave like prison system--
produced the first wave

00:28:10.220 --> 00:28:12.100
of black mass incarceration.

00:28:12.100 --> 00:28:14.850
Jail enforced work became
a normal experience

00:28:14.850 --> 00:28:16.410
for black men.

00:28:16.410 --> 00:28:20.580
Race strata were refined into
clear social and psychological

00:28:20.580 --> 00:28:25.210
planes with whiteness,
the Brahmin standard.

00:28:25.210 --> 00:28:29.146
Since then, the redemption
of white rule has weakened.

00:28:29.146 --> 00:28:32.440
This is a Klan march
in Washington, DC

00:28:32.440 --> 00:28:34.740
in the mid 1920s.

00:28:34.740 --> 00:28:37.850
But it has a way of
prolonging itself.

00:28:37.850 --> 00:28:41.320
A tilt toward blackness and
brownness in the race dialectic

00:28:41.320 --> 00:28:44.040
tends to be followed
by a white backlash.

00:28:44.040 --> 00:28:44.660
Backlash.

00:28:44.660 --> 00:28:47.150
Then gives way
incrementally only

00:28:47.150 --> 00:28:53.070
to yield eventually to
another success for whiteness.

00:28:56.130 --> 00:29:02.550
There is Attorney General
Jefferson Beauregard Sessions

00:29:02.550 --> 00:29:04.186
in the front--

00:29:04.186 --> 00:29:05.060
I'm kidding here.

00:29:05.060 --> 00:29:05.590
He's--

00:29:05.590 --> 00:29:15.280
[LAUGHTER]

00:29:15.280 --> 00:29:18.720
- President Barack Obama
often quoted a phrase

00:29:18.720 --> 00:29:22.160
used by Martin Luther King,
"the arc of the moral universe

00:29:22.160 --> 00:29:26.880
is long, but it bends
towards justice."

00:29:26.880 --> 00:29:31.890
Why retrieve from obscurity this
bitter and bloody Klan story?

00:29:31.890 --> 00:29:35.690
There is a personal motive,
and that is that it bothers me.

00:29:35.690 --> 00:29:40.280
It feels like finding a
corpse in the bedroom.

00:29:40.280 --> 00:29:43.410
I'm disgusted and ashamed.

00:29:43.410 --> 00:29:45.320
I had an inkling that
a great-grandfather

00:29:45.320 --> 00:29:48.710
had been a violent supremacist.

00:29:48.710 --> 00:29:53.980
But I did not see until research
just what he'd gotten up to.

00:29:53.980 --> 00:29:55.160
He was not a thoughtful man.

00:29:55.160 --> 00:29:58.370
He could write an invoice
for his carpentry work.

00:29:58.370 --> 00:30:01.230
But that's about all.

00:30:01.230 --> 00:30:04.110
And he did not develop the
idea of white entitlement

00:30:04.110 --> 00:30:08.550
that still circulates like an
odorless gas in the duct work.

00:30:08.550 --> 00:30:11.050
But God knows he put
poison in that gas.

00:30:11.050 --> 00:30:14.660
And he damaged the
lives of hundreds.

00:30:14.660 --> 00:30:16.910
But for other people
and not for me,

00:30:16.910 --> 00:30:21.940
why revive this filthy
story and bring it back?

00:30:21.940 --> 00:30:25.650
One reason is to try to harness
the tale of Constant LeCorgne,

00:30:25.650 --> 00:30:31.150
to repurpose it in some hope of
shining a small light on steps

00:30:31.150 --> 00:30:32.750
forward.

00:30:32.750 --> 00:30:35.480
50 years after the end of
the Civil Rights Movement,

00:30:35.480 --> 00:30:39.270
the white and black divide
remains caustic and fresh.

00:30:39.270 --> 00:30:45.030
That is because the US possesses
a tragic history, some of which

00:30:45.030 --> 00:30:48.210
Americans are unaware
of because much of it

00:30:48.210 --> 00:30:52.070
lies in the repressed
parts of collective memory.

00:30:52.070 --> 00:30:54.280
White supremacy of
all kinds, especially,

00:30:54.280 --> 00:30:56.950
is willfully forgotten.

00:30:56.950 --> 00:30:59.140
Here is another metaphor.

00:30:59.140 --> 00:31:01.370
Tribal whiteness is
like an infection

00:31:01.370 --> 00:31:03.990
trapped within a closed wound.

00:31:03.990 --> 00:31:07.400
To tell a story of a Klansman
is to cut into the wound

00:31:07.400 --> 00:31:10.810
and to wash it out in the
hope that it heals again

00:31:10.810 --> 00:31:14.140
with better result.

00:31:14.140 --> 00:31:16.810
One reason to summon
these harsh events

00:31:16.810 --> 00:31:18.630
is to apply a dose
of storytelling

00:31:18.630 --> 00:31:22.580
to the injuries inflicted
by supremacy, by extremist

00:31:22.580 --> 00:31:23.290
whiteness.

00:31:23.290 --> 00:31:25.540
The medicine comes late.

00:31:25.540 --> 00:31:28.210
And it is inadequate
to the wound.

00:31:28.210 --> 00:31:31.280
But we know that is needed.

00:31:31.280 --> 00:31:33.900
What are some of the
legacies of this Klansman

00:31:33.900 --> 00:31:36.230
and his Reconstruction
race wars?

00:31:36.230 --> 00:31:37.950
Here is one.

00:31:37.950 --> 00:31:40.050
Many whites find it
uncomfortable to speak

00:31:40.050 --> 00:31:42.120
about whiteness.

00:31:42.120 --> 00:31:44.060
We disliked being
labeled a member

00:31:44.060 --> 00:31:49.690
of a race, dislike acknowledging
that race is power.

00:31:49.690 --> 00:31:52.310
That is partly because
the Ku Klux and people

00:31:52.310 --> 00:31:58.100
like Constant LeCorgne made
whiteness an invisible norm.

00:31:58.100 --> 00:31:59.630
Supremacy is natural.

00:31:59.630 --> 00:32:04.970
And it was made so in part
by events in this story.

00:32:04.970 --> 00:32:06.820
The deep legacy
of the Ku Klux is

00:32:06.820 --> 00:32:09.580
the idea of whiteness,
itself, which many of us

00:32:09.580 --> 00:32:11.320
can hardly perceive.

00:32:11.320 --> 00:32:14.410
This is a monument to The White
League in New Orleans, which

00:32:14.410 --> 00:32:20.780
stood at the center of
the city for 125 years

00:32:20.780 --> 00:32:28.410
and was removed last week
under the cover of night

00:32:28.410 --> 00:32:35.410
with city workers wearing ski
masks with snipers on the roof

00:32:35.410 --> 00:32:40.560
tops of buildings
around it at 3:00 AM

00:32:40.560 --> 00:32:46.700
because city was worried that
there would be a reaction.

00:32:53.190 --> 00:32:54.750
The deep legacy
of the Ku Klux is

00:32:54.750 --> 00:32:59.020
the idea of whiteness, which
many of us can hardly perceive.

00:32:59.020 --> 00:33:01.110
I look hard to see it.

00:33:01.110 --> 00:33:03.520
The outline comes
into focus slowly,

00:33:03.520 --> 00:33:09.060
like sitting in a dark room and
waiting for the eyes to adjust.

00:33:09.060 --> 00:33:11.970
Whiteness is not just personal.

00:33:11.970 --> 00:33:17.030
It is not just a matter
of microaggressions.

00:33:17.030 --> 00:33:19.380
Whiteness, semi-consciously,
puts its hands

00:33:19.380 --> 00:33:26.282
on the levers of
politics and power,

00:33:26.282 --> 00:33:27.740
which brings us to
the White House.

00:33:31.230 --> 00:33:39.470
It is November 2016.

00:33:39.470 --> 00:33:43.560
150 years after the raids and
the victory of the Redemption,

00:33:43.560 --> 00:33:50.860
a conference takes place at
the Harvard Kennedy School.

00:33:50.860 --> 00:33:55.360
It brings together
the campaign managers

00:33:55.360 --> 00:33:58.560
for all of the
presidential campaigns--

00:33:58.560 --> 00:34:03.530
13, I think, Republican
campaigns, and the Clinton

00:34:03.530 --> 00:34:06.330
campaign, and the
Sanders campaign.

00:34:06.330 --> 00:34:09.840
I attended this conference as
a guest of a faculty member

00:34:09.840 --> 00:34:11.830
there.

00:34:11.830 --> 00:34:15.350
And in a room this
size, 200 people

00:34:15.350 --> 00:34:18.800
are arrayed around a
rectangular table in the center.

00:34:18.800 --> 00:34:23.210
And all of the campaign managers
are seated at this table.

00:34:23.210 --> 00:34:25.909
It's two weeks
after the election.

00:34:25.909 --> 00:34:29.530
And they're telling war stories.

00:34:29.530 --> 00:34:36.070
There's a guy there named Paul
Manafort, whom you may know

00:34:36.070 --> 00:34:40.340
was a manager of the
Donald Trump campaign

00:34:40.340 --> 00:34:46.820
until about April 2016,
when he was run off

00:34:46.820 --> 00:34:49.820
the campaign for malfeasance.

00:34:49.820 --> 00:34:54.350
There was a guy there named
Corey Lewandowski, whom

00:34:54.350 --> 00:34:57.380
you may remember was
the subsequent manager

00:34:57.380 --> 00:35:02.530
of the Donald Trump campaign
until he was run off

00:35:02.530 --> 00:35:05.930
of the campaign for malfeasance.

00:35:05.930 --> 00:35:10.270
There was a woman there
named Kellyanne Conway,

00:35:10.270 --> 00:35:12.850
who was the last man standing
when the election actually

00:35:12.850 --> 00:35:16.610
happened and who's now
a White House adviser.

00:35:16.610 --> 00:35:22.400
And Cory Lewandowski
is saying, "we

00:35:22.400 --> 00:35:26.100
wanted to make sure we got
the populous message across.

00:35:26.100 --> 00:35:29.080
And the way we did that
was to show the money.

00:35:29.080 --> 00:35:34.520
We made sure that the
airplane was in every TV shot.

00:35:34.520 --> 00:35:38.090
We made sure we had the most
expensive hotels, the most

00:35:38.090 --> 00:35:39.370
expensive cars.

00:35:39.370 --> 00:35:42.380
And we made every
interview on the plane.

00:35:42.380 --> 00:35:45.700
We wanted to show
that what we had

00:35:45.700 --> 00:35:49.180
was one of the very most
successful and richest men

00:35:49.180 --> 00:35:52.380
in the country because we knew
that that was the way to reach

00:35:52.380 --> 00:35:55.560
the great mass of the people.

00:35:55.560 --> 00:35:57.830
That's what they wanted."

00:35:57.830 --> 00:36:07.640
So there was a day of this
kind of gloating war stories

00:36:07.640 --> 00:36:12.320
until the end of the day
when the conference blew up

00:36:12.320 --> 00:36:17.550
and there was a disagreement
between the Clinton

00:36:17.550 --> 00:36:24.100
people and the Trump people.

00:36:24.100 --> 00:36:27.210
And here is an excerpt five
minutes long from that.

00:36:27.210 --> 00:36:28.890
- [INAUDIBLE].

00:36:28.890 --> 00:36:31.630
I mean, we can go
through the list.

00:36:31.630 --> 00:36:34.250
But it's not as though
there weren't moments

00:36:34.250 --> 00:36:36.320
in the campaign where
he created controversy

00:36:36.320 --> 00:36:39.900
having to do with race,
or gender, or religion.

00:36:39.900 --> 00:36:40.720
- But Dan, can we--

00:36:40.720 --> 00:36:42.910
- But how does that affect--

00:36:42.910 --> 00:36:44.460
your question was
about Steve Bannon.

00:36:44.460 --> 00:36:45.459
- Well, because he was--

00:36:45.929 --> 00:36:47.720
- You're trying to
dovetail the two things.

00:36:47.720 --> 00:36:50.540
So when Donald Trump said
something in January, February,

00:36:50.540 --> 00:36:52.410
March, April, whenever--

00:36:52.410 --> 00:36:57.120
had nothing to do with the
smear campaign of the left

00:36:57.120 --> 00:36:58.810
on Steve Bannon today.

00:36:58.810 --> 00:36:59.310
OK.

00:37:02.090 --> 00:37:04.230
Well it's ridiculous.

00:37:04.230 --> 00:37:06.380
And to be candid
with you, the guy

00:37:06.380 --> 00:37:09.500
is an unbelievably
brilliant strategist

00:37:09.500 --> 00:37:17.500
who is really a terrific guy
who, as Kellyanne just said,

00:37:17.500 --> 00:37:20.510
a guy who has a
Harvard pedigree and is

00:37:20.510 --> 00:37:24.860
getting attacked by people who
have no idea how many years--

00:37:24.860 --> 00:37:25.360
- Wait.

00:37:25.360 --> 00:37:26.770
Hold on, OK.

00:37:26.770 --> 00:37:27.550
No.

00:37:27.550 --> 00:37:27.770
No.

00:37:27.770 --> 00:37:28.936
- We happen to sitting here.

00:37:28.936 --> 00:37:29.630
But listen.

00:37:29.630 --> 00:37:33.404
He gets held to a standard
that none of these other folks

00:37:33.404 --> 00:37:34.070
will be held to.

00:37:34.070 --> 00:37:34.930
- Let me--

00:37:34.930 --> 00:37:39.700
- Dan, if providing a platform
for white supremacists

00:37:39.700 --> 00:37:45.240
makes me a brilliant tactician,
I am glad to have lost.

00:37:45.240 --> 00:37:47.530
And one of Hillary--
give me a minute, David.

00:37:47.530 --> 00:37:50.270
I am more proud of Hillary
Clinton's alt-right speech than

00:37:50.270 --> 00:37:53.110
any other moment on the campaign
because she had the courage

00:37:53.110 --> 00:37:54.410
to stand up--

00:37:54.410 --> 00:37:57.210
I would rather lose than
win the way you guys did.

00:37:57.210 --> 00:37:58.060
- No, you wouldn't.

00:37:58.060 --> 00:37:58.410
- Yes.

00:37:58.410 --> 00:37:58.951
- Absolutely.

00:37:58.951 --> 00:37:59.767
- Yes, yes.

00:37:59.767 --> 00:38:00.850
- That's very clear today.

00:38:00.850 --> 00:38:03.220
No, you wouldn't, respectfully.

00:38:03.220 --> 00:38:04.950
I'm sorry, how
exactly did we win?

00:38:04.950 --> 00:38:05.992
No, go for it, Jen.

00:38:05.992 --> 00:38:06.950
How exactly did we win?

00:38:06.950 --> 00:38:07.900
I'd like to know.

00:38:07.900 --> 00:38:10.400
Because I sacrificed the last
four months of my life to do--

00:38:10.400 --> 00:38:11.747
excuse me--

00:38:11.747 --> 00:38:12.330
and we did it.

00:38:12.330 --> 00:38:13.996
And we did it by
looking at the schedule

00:38:13.996 --> 00:38:16.300
and looking at, yes, the
electoral map of 270.

00:38:16.300 --> 00:38:18.200
Because that's how you
win the presidency.

00:38:18.200 --> 00:38:19.140
And we went places.

00:38:19.140 --> 00:38:21.352
And we were either
ignored or mocked roundly

00:38:21.352 --> 00:38:22.810
by most of the
people in this room.

00:38:22.810 --> 00:38:25.310
But I have a smile on
my face at all times.

00:38:25.310 --> 00:38:28.440
And we did it by focusing with
Steve Bannon and Dave Bossie

00:38:28.440 --> 00:38:30.602
and everybody you see here.

00:38:30.602 --> 00:38:32.060
They're going to
say, "oh, she just

00:38:32.060 --> 00:38:34.400
said Corey was part of the
campaign," Jeff Zucker.

00:38:34.400 --> 00:38:35.680
OK, Corey, until whatever.

00:38:35.680 --> 00:38:37.040
What was that June?

00:38:37.040 --> 00:38:39.814
And we focused on
how you would-- we

00:38:39.814 --> 00:38:40.730
connected with voters.

00:38:40.730 --> 00:38:42.190
We connected with voters.

00:38:42.190 --> 00:38:45.470
- --hiring is himself.

00:38:45.470 --> 00:38:48.760
We've already gone through
some of the examples

00:38:48.760 --> 00:38:51.880
of his own language, his
own positions that I believe

00:38:51.880 --> 00:38:54.090
are at odds with my
values as an American

00:38:54.090 --> 00:38:59.010
of embracing diversity,
inclusivity, equality,

00:38:59.010 --> 00:39:00.966
and hiring someone
like Steve Bannon--

00:39:00.966 --> 00:39:03.100
- --which is exactly
what Breitbart--

00:39:03.100 --> 00:39:05.230
- --who with Breitbart--

00:39:05.230 --> 00:39:07.713
- --if you guys you spend a
few minutes on Breitbart--

00:39:07.713 --> 00:39:09.129
- --gives these
people a platform.

00:39:09.129 --> 00:39:10.781
- You say things
doesn't make it true.

00:39:10.781 --> 00:39:12.970
- One of my proudest
moments of her,

00:39:12.970 --> 00:39:17.050
is her standing up and saying
with courage and clarity,

00:39:17.050 --> 00:39:20.960
in Steve Bannon's own words
and Donald Trump's own words,

00:39:20.960 --> 00:39:24.230
the platform that they
gave to white supremacists,

00:39:24.230 --> 00:39:27.390
white nationalists--
and it's a very,

00:39:27.390 --> 00:39:30.950
very important moment in
our history of our country.

00:39:30.950 --> 00:39:33.449
And I think as his
presidency goes forward,

00:39:33.449 --> 00:39:35.240
I'm going to be very
glad to have been part

00:39:35.240 --> 00:39:36.489
of the campaign that's tried--

00:39:36.989 --> 00:39:39.507
- Jen, do you think-- excuse
me, she said white supremacy.

00:39:39.507 --> 00:39:40.590
- Well, I would actually--

00:39:40.590 --> 00:39:41.400
- I'm sorry.

00:39:41.400 --> 00:39:42.920
I know it's mentioned a
lot on your website too.

00:39:42.920 --> 00:39:45.275
Do you think I ran a campaign
where white supremacists had

00:39:45.275 --> 00:39:45.770
a platform?

00:39:45.770 --> 00:39:47.160
You going to look me in
the face and tell me that?

00:39:47.160 --> 00:39:47.806
- It's did.

00:39:47.806 --> 00:39:48.794
Kellyanne, it did.

00:39:49.203 --> 00:39:50.286
- And that's how you lost.

00:39:50.286 --> 00:39:51.774
Do you think you could have
just had a decent message--

00:39:51.774 --> 00:39:52.766
- You guys are pathetic.

00:39:52.766 --> 00:39:54.391
- --for the white
working-class voters.

00:39:54.391 --> 00:39:55.990
You think this woman
who has nothing

00:39:55.990 --> 00:39:57.230
in common with anybody--

00:39:57.230 --> 00:39:59.271
- I'm not saying that's
how you won, but that's--

00:39:59.271 --> 00:40:02.099
- [INAUDIBLE] over 200 counties
that President Obama won

00:40:02.099 --> 00:40:03.182
and Donald Trump just won.

00:40:03.182 --> 00:40:05.166
You think that's because
of what you just said

00:40:05.166 --> 00:40:07.642
or because people aren't
ready for a woman president.

00:40:07.642 --> 00:40:08.142
Really?

00:40:08.142 --> 00:40:10.126
How about it's Hillary Clinton?

00:40:10.126 --> 00:40:11.614
She doesn't connect with people.

00:40:11.614 --> 00:40:13.598
How about they have
nothing in common with her?

00:40:13.598 --> 00:40:15.578
How about you had
no economic message?

00:40:15.578 --> 00:40:16.078
- Guys

00:40:16.078 --> 00:40:18.260
- --honest conversation
about what happened in this

00:40:18.260 --> 00:40:18.760
campaign--

00:40:18.760 --> 00:40:19.306
- We are.

00:40:19.306 --> 00:40:19.930
- --so hold on.

00:40:19.930 --> 00:40:21.930
- You guys are not.

00:40:21.930 --> 00:40:23.830
- They want this to be
about the strategists.

00:40:23.830 --> 00:40:24.260
That's right.

00:40:24.260 --> 00:40:25.500
- You guys are punching down.

00:40:25.500 --> 00:40:26.470
It's unbelievable.

00:40:26.470 --> 00:40:27.877
- Hold on.

00:40:27.877 --> 00:40:30.222
You're talking about
one Steve Bannon.

00:40:30.222 --> 00:40:33.040
[GROANING]

00:40:33.040 --> 00:40:37.040
- There's another Steve Bannon,
as the CEO of Breitbart.

00:40:37.040 --> 00:40:40.920
He, himself, has said that was
a platform for the alt-right,

00:40:40.920 --> 00:40:41.490
the platform.

00:40:41.490 --> 00:40:44.824
Now just two weeks ago--

00:40:44.824 --> 00:40:46.240
in the rise of the
at-right, which

00:40:46.240 --> 00:40:48.950
is now part of the
mainstream of our politics,

00:40:48.950 --> 00:40:50.790
America is for white people.

00:40:50.790 --> 00:40:52.230
So don't tell me.

00:40:52.230 --> 00:40:55.430
And that is the
kind of platform--

00:40:55.430 --> 00:40:56.479
there's a video of it.

00:40:56.479 --> 00:40:57.020
That is the--

00:40:57.020 --> 00:40:57.561
- No, no, no.

00:40:57.561 --> 00:40:59.441
Prove yourself of what
you just said, Karen.

00:40:59.441 --> 00:41:00.065
Prove yourself.

00:41:06.580 --> 00:41:09.721
I have the idea that there
is white supremacy on the one

00:41:09.721 --> 00:41:10.220
hand.

00:41:10.220 --> 00:41:14.020
And there is white
supremacy on the other.

00:41:14.020 --> 00:41:16.840
There's violent
supremacy and yet,

00:41:16.840 --> 00:41:21.070
all the way across the spectrum,
there's a kinder, gentler kind.

00:41:21.070 --> 00:41:24.210
It is Father's Knows
Best whiteness.

00:41:24.210 --> 00:41:25.180
It is atmospheric.

00:41:25.180 --> 00:41:29.790
And it permeates
the social common.

00:41:29.790 --> 00:41:31.370
I have the idea
that supremacy is

00:41:31.370 --> 00:41:36.510
a gas introduced in pure form
by the people I've talked about.

00:41:36.510 --> 00:41:40.300
And yet the chemical is
titrated and diluted in order

00:41:40.300 --> 00:41:43.250
to circulate invisibly.

00:41:43.250 --> 00:41:45.700
Now I don't think that we
are in the midst of a return

00:41:45.700 --> 00:41:48.380
to the barbarism of the
race wars of the Old South

00:41:48.380 --> 00:41:51.350
during Reconstruction.

00:41:51.350 --> 00:41:54.310
In my worldview, perhaps that
is what passes for optimism.

00:41:56.759 --> 00:41:58.300
Although within the
last weeks, there

00:41:58.300 --> 00:41:59.910
have been street
fights involving

00:41:59.910 --> 00:42:02.830
supremacist at Berkeley.

00:42:02.830 --> 00:42:05.420
There is little doubt,
however, that the concentration

00:42:05.420 --> 00:42:07.880
of that gas in
the air is rising.

00:42:07.880 --> 00:42:11.992
And we are in a period of rising
white anger in its ugly forms.

00:42:15.230 --> 00:42:17.420
I leave you with what
my Aunt Maude said

00:42:17.420 --> 00:42:20.160
to me, which was,
"son, we are part

00:42:20.160 --> 00:42:26.530
of the petit blanc, the petit
blanc, the little whites.

00:42:26.530 --> 00:42:28.350
That's what they callled us.

00:42:28.350 --> 00:42:30.180
Le grand blanc called us that.

00:42:30.180 --> 00:42:34.420
And the Negroes called
us that, the petit blanc.

00:42:34.420 --> 00:42:38.540
We are not grand
people, but small ones.

00:42:38.540 --> 00:42:42.410
And my grandfather, he
was trying to lift us up.

00:42:42.410 --> 00:42:45.770
It is too bad with
that White League.

00:42:45.770 --> 00:42:49.380
But they ain't nothing we can
do about it now, now is there?"

00:42:52.300 --> 00:42:53.615
Thank you very much.

00:42:53.615 --> 00:42:55.835
[APPLAUSE]
