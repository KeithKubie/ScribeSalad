00:00:00.450 --> 00:00:03.600
I'm here with Matt from Matt it's so good to have you here.

00:00:03.600 --> 00:00:04.780
&gt;&gt; It's great to be here.

00:00:04.780 --> 00:00:07.860
You know I I came here to two things.

00:00:07.860 --> 00:00:10.605
Chew bubble gum and talk about graphing and I'm all out of bubble gum.

00:00:10.605 --> 00:00:12.490
[LAUGH] So, excited to be here.

00:00:12.490 --> 00:00:18.730
&gt;&gt; Great so tell us, what is &gt;&gt; So we're a graphic and analytics platform and

00:00:18.730 --> 00:00:23.390
the idea behind it has been that we want really two things.

00:00:23.390 --> 00:00:27.500
One is for anyone at any level of tech, technical sophistication to be

00:00:27.500 --> 00:00:31.800
able to make a really pretty interactive and collaborative graph.

00:00:31.800 --> 00:00:34.230
So in the same way that you might make graphs, you know,

00:00:34.230 --> 00:00:37.910
with Google Docs, or you know, editing documents with Google docs,

00:00:37.910 --> 00:00:42.040
we want people to be able to edit and analyze data and make graphs there online.

00:00:43.060 --> 00:00:46.920
And we'd like that to be something that's useful for high schoolers and

00:00:46.920 --> 00:00:51.120
then also all the way up to folks who are working on technical and

00:00:51.120 --> 00:00:53.690
sophisticated projects that we have corporations and

00:00:53.690 --> 00:00:55.580
folks at the Washington Post who are using it too.

00:00:56.880 --> 00:01:01.330
So first part is anyone at any level making and sharing graphs.

00:01:01.330 --> 00:01:05.690
And then the second part is being able to have it be a hub for your data and

00:01:05.690 --> 00:01:08.790
your graphs and your code and your collaboration.

00:01:08.790 --> 00:01:13.710
So typically when you make a graph, you have some data and then you analyze it,

00:01:13.710 --> 00:01:17.430
and then you use either code or maybe a program like Excel or

00:01:17.430 --> 00:01:19.130
Tableau to make your graph.

00:01:19.130 --> 00:01:20.560
And then you email about it.

00:01:20.560 --> 00:01:24.411
So you have to put all of those things into an email or into you know,

00:01:24.411 --> 00:01:25.460
shared folder.

00:01:25.460 --> 00:01:28.260
And then other people kind of have to look at it locally and

00:01:28.260 --> 00:01:30.270
check out the data themselves.

00:01:30.270 --> 00:01:34.055
But for us we've tried to make it so, that all of that happens off code,

00:01:34.055 --> 00:01:37.710
graph, data, and collaboration all in one place.

00:01:37.710 --> 00:01:39.440
And it happens between languages.

00:01:39.440 --> 00:01:42.610
So you can add a graph with any language or just a web app.
