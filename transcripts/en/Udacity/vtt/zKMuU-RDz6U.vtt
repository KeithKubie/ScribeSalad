00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.610
So Dave has the same problem that Alice, Bob, and Carol also had.

00:00:03.610 --> 00:00:08.119
If he uses a simple or a naive algorithm to solve shortest tour,

00:00:08.119 --> 00:00:11.030
then this algorithm will not deliver an acceptable running time,

00:00:11.030 --> 00:00:15.010
because what a simple algorithm would do to solve shortest tour is

00:00:15.010 --> 00:00:19.560
that algorithm would simply try all possible orderings for the houses.

00:00:19.560 --> 00:00:22.740
So, what I just asked you to fill out in the last quiz,

00:00:22.740 --> 00:00:26.490
the computer would just go through all possibilities of saying

00:00:26.490 --> 00:00:29.720
this is the first house to visit, this is the second house to visit,

00:00:29.720 --> 00:00:32.720
and then go to the following house as the 3rd house, and so on.

00:00:32.720 --> 00:00:35.860
So we have not even needed to go deep into the details

00:00:35.860 --> 00:00:38.730
to see that this algorithm will quickly fail

00:00:38.730 --> 00:00:41.400
once the number of houses grows,

00:00:41.400 --> 00:00:46.270
because the number of possible orderings here will grow enormously with n

00:00:46.270 --> 00:00:47.880
where n is the number of houses.

00:00:47.880 --> 00:00:50.330
So, let's do a little quiz to make this more explicit.

00:00:50.330 --> 00:00:53.260
So, what I would like you to tell me is

00:00:53.260 --> 00:00:56.990
if we had 5 houses to visit, not counting the base we start from and get back to,

00:00:56.990 --> 00:01:00.260
but 5 houses where we can decide in which order to visit them,

00:01:00.260 --> 00:01:03.380
how many ways are there to visit 5 houses,

00:01:03.380 --> 00:01:06.700
and then how many different ways are there to visit 10 houses.

00:01:06.700 --> 00:01:11.260
You are going to need a program or calculator for figuring out at least the second one;

00:01:11.260 --> 00:01:13.010
the first one you can probably do in your head,

00:01:13.010 --> 99:59:59.000
but for this one you already need the computer to calculate the number.
