&gt;&gt; Speaker 1: From the Library
of Congress in Washington D.C.

00:00:18.110 --> 00:00:20.220
&gt;&gt; Thach Quang Nguyen:
Good morning everybody.

00:00:20.220 --> 00:00:23.010
Thank -- thank LOC for giving --

00:00:23.010 --> 00:00:27.180
giving me time to be here
to learn from all of you

00:00:27.180 --> 00:00:31.190
and to have something
from our --

00:00:31.190 --> 00:00:34.990
from me to say to all of you.

00:00:34.990 --> 00:00:37.430
When I was 17 years
old, I want to be --

00:00:37.430 --> 00:00:39.940
I wanted to be a novelist.

00:00:39.940 --> 00:00:44.050
So at that time, I set
up my life to our plight

00:00:44.050 --> 00:00:46.350
to ask capital for writing.

00:00:46.350 --> 00:00:51.640
And two years in the society
I saw lots of bad things.

00:00:51.640 --> 00:00:56.060
So I have found other way to
become a university student.

00:00:56.060 --> 00:01:00.040
And when I was 21,
I set my life target

00:01:00.040 --> 00:01:03.330
to become Prime Minister
to change Vietnam.

00:01:03.330 --> 00:01:07.970
But after one year, after a
shock, when I find a way to --

00:01:10.040 --> 00:01:14.630
to help mentor weak woman to
take her home, but I saw problem

00:01:14.630 --> 00:01:17.730
with lots of people, but
only one student help me.

00:01:17.730 --> 00:01:19.500
So I've got shock.

00:01:19.500 --> 00:01:25.480
After taking her home, I
decided to become a library --

00:01:25.480 --> 00:01:28.250
a library revolutionary
to change Vietnam.

00:01:28.250 --> 00:01:33.000
So here is -- I want to
show what I have been doing.

00:01:39.570 --> 00:01:43.410
When I -- when I decided to
become library revolutionary,

00:01:43.410 --> 00:01:50.340
I make lots of interview
and to see that, in Vietnam,

00:01:50.340 --> 00:01:54.020
rural children do not -- did
not have book for reading.

00:01:54.020 --> 00:02:02.080
And school libraries, very
poor, poorly operational.

00:02:02.080 --> 00:02:05.900
So that why we have this number.

00:02:05.900 --> 00:02:09.670
Now, there's my inter
-- my surveys.

00:02:09.670 --> 00:02:14.210
And the other is
from the government.

00:02:14.210 --> 00:02:20.550
Here is a very aftermath
of our society.

00:02:20.550 --> 00:02:22.850
So,

00:02:25.170 --> 00:02:27.520
I took 10 years to
be [Inaudible]

00:02:27.520 --> 00:02:30.730
for revolution with
my own money.

00:02:30.730 --> 00:02:35.560
And then -- then I develop a
civil library system library

00:02:35.560 --> 00:02:38.600
system, which, the first
one is a Clan library.

00:02:38.600 --> 00:02:42.100
We base on clan -- a
big family in Vietnam.

00:02:42.100 --> 00:02:44.450
Have same ancestor
to build library.

00:02:44.450 --> 00:02:47.580
And there are lots
of clan in Vietnam.

00:02:47.580 --> 00:02:54.080
And I make a model after
they see it on news on TV.

00:02:54.080 --> 00:02:58.640
And very second and very
successful model is the fund --

00:02:58.640 --> 00:03:00.290
parent-funded library.

00:03:00.290 --> 00:03:05.070
We now in Vietnam, most -- more
than 80% of the people come

00:03:05.070 --> 00:03:08.290
from rural area and
they are farmer.

00:03:08.290 --> 00:03:09.900
And they have very low income.

00:03:09.900 --> 00:03:14.930
Only 50 or 100 U.S. dollar
per month per person.

00:03:14.930 --> 00:03:17.470
So I use the most desired model

00:03:17.470 --> 00:03:20.920
that the low income parent
can contribute only two

00:03:20.920 --> 00:03:24.950
or three U.S. dollar per
year to start the library.

00:03:24.950 --> 00:03:29.990
And then their children can
read about more than 50 books.

00:03:29.990 --> 00:03:32.660
Only one -- no time for reading.

00:03:32.660 --> 00:03:36.630
But they get together
and some more money

00:03:36.630 --> 00:03:42.190
and they make big money to do
a big library in the classroom.

00:03:42.190 --> 00:03:47.170
And this model becomes very
[Inaudible] in Vietnam.

00:03:47.170 --> 00:03:49.000
Lots of social member.

00:03:49.000 --> 00:03:54.930
Children can be with
and parent be with.

00:03:54.930 --> 00:03:58.870
And [Inaudible] one parish
library we have for about,

00:03:58.870 --> 00:04:03.710
in Vietnam, have
about 7 million cities

00:04:03.710 --> 00:04:06.070
and these are religious
follower.

00:04:06.070 --> 00:04:09.920
So we build that
structure to build library.

00:04:09.920 --> 00:04:13.670
So, in coming years,
it's about --

00:04:13.670 --> 00:04:20.640
I predict about 1 million
religious children have a book

00:04:20.640 --> 00:04:24.980
because every case the
Catholic system to do that.

00:04:24.980 --> 00:04:30.100
And I also built back-front
military officer library.

00:04:30.100 --> 00:04:33.950
Because in newer area, the
military officer and police

00:04:33.950 --> 00:04:37.580
and [Inaudible] teacher
have a good, stable income.

00:04:37.580 --> 00:04:43.190
So we develop this so that
many family, they build library

00:04:43.190 --> 00:04:46.590
for your children and
villager to read it.

00:04:46.590 --> 00:04:47.890
Here, achievements.

00:04:47.890 --> 00:04:54.040
I think now it is easy --
not easy to count the number

00:04:54.040 --> 00:04:57.130
of library increase daily.

00:04:58.300 --> 00:04:59.600
And

00:04:59.600 --> 00:05:03.200
now more than 20,000
library already built.

00:05:03.200 --> 00:05:08.700
And this number is increasing
very fast -- rapidly.

00:05:08.700 --> 00:05:14.690
And about 300,000 Vietnamese
and oversee Vietnamese engaged

00:05:14.690 --> 00:05:16.940
in building and many people

00:05:16.940 --> 00:05:20.030
from America contribute
money to build it.

00:05:20.030 --> 00:05:23.950
And now, more than 1 million
rural readers have benefit

00:05:23.950 --> 00:05:25.980
from my -- our system.

00:05:25.980 --> 00:05:28.710
And here is a very
big number for me.

00:05:28.710 --> 00:05:33.480
Number of book borrowed by rural
student has increased from zero

00:05:33.480 --> 00:05:37.580
to 12.5 books per year
to 10 to 30 per year.

00:05:37.580 --> 00:05:38.970
Yeah.

00:05:38.970 --> 00:05:43.590
Because we, when the library in
the classroom, they're reading.

00:05:43.590 --> 00:05:50.190
Very easy for them to
read and to access it.

00:05:50.190 --> 00:05:53.150
And in achievements, you know,

00:05:53.150 --> 00:05:55.350
many parent in rural
area are now,

00:05:55.350 --> 00:05:59.530
they're reading books
for their children.

00:05:59.530 --> 00:06:02.030
That is never before.

00:06:02.030 --> 00:06:05.190
Two libraries model include
in the government system.

00:06:05.190 --> 00:06:07.690
Minister of Education
and Minister

00:06:07.690 --> 00:06:11.920
of Culture already got two
models into their system.

00:06:11.920 --> 00:06:18.650
So we have NGO and UNESCO
cooperate in 2009 and last year.

00:06:18.650 --> 00:06:21.520
And now we are develop
STEM education.

00:06:21.520 --> 00:06:24.110
It's an American model so it --

00:06:24.110 --> 00:06:26.800
we make recycle STEM
in rural area.

00:06:26.800 --> 00:06:29.280
[Laughter] Yeah.

00:06:29.280 --> 00:06:33.920
Here is the [Inaudible] Deputy
Prime Minister work with me

00:06:33.920 --> 00:06:37.970
and we will develop the
system faster and faster.

00:06:41.190 --> 00:06:42.490
Ongoing work.

00:06:42.490 --> 00:06:46.450
We are building a master plan
to attract 10 million children

00:06:46.450 --> 00:06:49.320
to use lucky money
to build library.

00:06:49.320 --> 00:06:54.180
And yearly about 50 million
U.S. dollar for [Inaudible]

00:06:54.180 --> 00:06:58.790
for the children in the New
Year [Inaudible] in Vietnam.

00:06:58.790 --> 00:07:00.640
And we are -- we are --

00:07:00.640 --> 00:07:04.160
I am trying to learn the
reading encouragement strategies

00:07:04.160 --> 00:07:07.570
from U.S. organizations
for adapting

00:07:07.570 --> 00:07:09.920
and applying in Vietnam.

00:07:09.920 --> 00:07:12.710
And I will also developing
reading encouragement models

00:07:12.710 --> 00:07:18.700
to apply both in college -- in
school and in the community.

00:07:18.700 --> 00:07:24.160
So it's my want -- my
desire -- my ambition again.

00:07:24.160 --> 00:07:30.290
In 2015, I go after about
4 million first step

00:07:30.290 --> 00:07:33.720
to raise awareness for
the Vietnamese people

00:07:33.720 --> 00:07:37.470
and to advocate the
policy for Vietnam.

00:07:37.470 --> 00:07:40.510
And now it is already
success -- success.

00:07:40.510 --> 00:07:47.320
So I want to use my footsteps
to power footsteps to walk

00:07:47.320 --> 00:07:52.890
around the worlds to make
a kind of global campaign

00:07:52.890 --> 00:07:56.590
for reinforcing right to
read for the world children.

00:07:56.590 --> 00:08:01.440
So I am very happy today to say
[Inaudible] from India here.

00:08:01.440 --> 00:08:03.570
So I want to organize
the country to raise fund

00:08:03.570 --> 00:08:09.820
for local library organizations
like Pratham Book classroom.

00:08:09.820 --> 00:08:12.630
Desire to devote -- I
desire to devote my --

00:08:12.630 --> 00:08:14.430
the rest of my life
to the world children.

00:08:14.430 --> 00:08:19.000
You see after 2 million children
in India cannot own a book

00:08:19.000 --> 00:08:23.040
because of the cost is a
figure of Pratham Book.

00:08:23.040 --> 00:08:27.390
So I hope that -- I have
only one, only one eye.

00:08:27.390 --> 00:08:28.710
Blind already.

00:08:28.710 --> 00:08:33.980
So I hope that before the remain
blind, I have a chance to walk

00:08:33.980 --> 00:08:39.150
around the world to raise
problem about reading --

00:08:39.150 --> 00:08:42.360
about lack of reading
for the children,

00:08:42.360 --> 00:08:44.200
lack of move forward children,

00:08:44.200 --> 00:08:49.930
and I hope that we all here
shake hands to make a change

00:08:49.930 --> 00:08:52.650
in the international scope

00:08:52.650 --> 00:08:55.110
to have all children
have a book to read.

00:08:55.110 --> 00:08:57.510
As you know, you do not go

00:08:57.510 --> 00:09:05.040
[Inaudible]

00:09:05.040 --> 00:09:12.830
about seven -- more than
750 million children,

00:09:12.830 --> 00:09:15.230
people in the world, illiterate.

00:09:15.230 --> 00:09:17.860
So we -- so shake
hands to keep it down.

00:09:17.860 --> 00:09:19.160
All right?

00:09:19.160 --> 00:09:23.100
So it is starting from building
library for the children.

00:09:23.100 --> 00:09:28.460
So I hope that next year in
2008 the Pratham Book and I,

00:09:28.460 --> 00:09:30.810
we can shake hands together.

00:09:30.810 --> 00:09:36.680
I can walk in your country
about 1 million -- no --

00:09:36.680 --> 00:09:42.510
1,000 kilometer from
[Inaudible] to raise and to call

00:09:42.510 --> 00:09:45.500
in the Indian people
to shake hands

00:09:45.500 --> 00:09:47.490
to replicate some of those.

00:09:47.490 --> 00:09:50.050
Some of those very excellent.

00:09:50.050 --> 00:09:52.790
So, thank you again.

00:09:52.790 --> 00:09:54.720
