00:00:00.157 --> 00:00:02.290
- [Instructor] Often when we think about

00:00:02.290 --> 00:00:04.622
the beginning of American history,

00:00:04.622 --> 00:00:08.543
we think 1776, with the
Declaration of Independence,

00:00:08.543 --> 00:00:13.205
or maybe 1492, when Columbus
arrived in the Americas.

00:00:13.205 --> 00:00:15.321
But the history of America really begins

00:00:15.321 --> 00:00:17.238
about 15,000 years ago,

00:00:18.643 --> 00:00:21.243
when people first arrived in the Americas.

00:00:21.243 --> 00:00:24.569
In this video, I want to
provide a very brief overview

00:00:24.569 --> 00:00:27.302
of native societies before contact

00:00:27.302 --> 00:00:29.788
to give you an idea of just how diverse

00:00:29.788 --> 00:00:31.922
and complex these societies were,

00:00:31.922 --> 00:00:34.423
as native groups adapted to

00:00:34.423 --> 00:00:36.885
and interacted with their environments.

00:00:36.885 --> 00:00:39.841
Now there's recently
been a scholarly debate

00:00:39.841 --> 00:00:41.684
about how people first arrived.

00:00:41.684 --> 00:00:44.193
We know that maybe 12,000 years ago,

00:00:44.193 --> 00:00:47.195
during an ice age, the
sea level was lower,

00:00:47.195 --> 00:00:49.862
and so a spit of land in between

00:00:50.958 --> 00:00:53.655
the Americas and Asia was exposed,

00:00:53.655 --> 00:00:55.795
over which people may have traveled.

00:00:55.795 --> 00:00:58.502
But recent archeological evidence suggests

00:00:58.502 --> 00:01:02.067
that people were perhaps
already in the Americas

00:01:02.067 --> 00:01:03.948
at the time of this ice age,

00:01:03.948 --> 00:01:05.623
so it's possible

00:01:05.623 --> 00:01:08.899
that they may have come earlier in boats.

00:01:08.899 --> 00:01:10.859
Now however it was that they arrived,

00:01:10.859 --> 00:01:13.905
they spread north and south

00:01:13.905 --> 00:01:16.428
and east throughout the Americas

00:01:16.428 --> 00:01:20.595
so that by the time that Europeans
arrived in the late 1400s

00:01:21.789 --> 00:01:23.539
there were perhaps 50

00:01:25.097 --> 00:01:26.347
million people.

00:01:27.466 --> 00:01:31.549
That's kind of a mid-range
number for the estimates,

00:01:31.549 --> 00:01:33.097
that historians have made,

00:01:33.097 --> 00:01:34.527
living in the Americas.

00:01:34.527 --> 00:01:37.277
And of those, four to six million

00:01:38.785 --> 00:01:40.673
were living in North America.

00:01:40.673 --> 00:01:42.675
So how did these societies develop?

00:01:42.675 --> 00:01:46.508
Well, a really big moment
was around 5000 BCE,

00:01:48.126 --> 00:01:51.459
when people in Mexico domesticated corn,

00:01:53.991 --> 00:01:56.158
maize, as it's also known.

00:01:57.324 --> 00:02:00.803
And domesticating maize meant that people

00:02:00.803 --> 00:02:04.386
who had originally been
hunters, gatherers,

00:02:07.738 --> 00:02:09.905
following herds of animals

00:02:12.817 --> 00:02:15.900
could partake in settled agriculture.

00:02:17.769 --> 00:02:21.936
So they could develop
villages, complex societies.

00:02:23.026 --> 00:02:26.326
This isn't to say that they
stopped hunting or gathering,

00:02:26.326 --> 00:02:29.306
but they began staying in one place.

00:02:29.306 --> 00:02:32.665
So let's zoom in a little
bit and take a look

00:02:32.665 --> 00:02:36.231
at some of the major
societies in these regions.

00:02:36.231 --> 00:02:38.882
Native American societies developed

00:02:38.882 --> 00:02:41.419
around their natural environments,

00:02:41.419 --> 00:02:44.247
using the resources that
were available to them.

00:02:44.247 --> 00:02:47.951
For example, the Southwest,
Plains and Great Basin

00:02:47.951 --> 00:02:50.200
were quite dry.

00:02:50.370 --> 00:02:51.516
A lot of desert.

00:02:51.516 --> 00:02:54.213
And so societies in these regions

00:02:54.213 --> 00:02:57.376
adapted to the dry
climate in several ways.

00:02:57.376 --> 00:02:59.392
For example, Native American groups

00:02:59.392 --> 00:03:01.450
that lived on the Great Plains

00:03:01.450 --> 00:03:05.041
continued their hunting
and gathering way of life.

00:03:05.041 --> 00:03:08.000
Hunting bison,

00:03:08.086 --> 00:03:11.374
and following the herds of animals

00:03:11.374 --> 00:03:13.400
in teepees,

00:03:13.434 --> 00:03:16.172
which were dwellings that were easy

00:03:16.172 --> 00:03:18.257
to set up and then take down.

00:03:18.257 --> 00:03:24.700
People in the Southwest, like
the Ancestral Puebloan people,

00:03:24.703 --> 00:03:26.671
dealt with this dry environment

00:03:26.671 --> 00:03:31.500
by creating very complex
irrigation projects

00:03:31.550 --> 00:03:35.038
so that they could water their maize crops

00:03:35.038 --> 00:03:37.548
using what little moisture there was.

00:03:37.548 --> 00:03:41.619
The Puebloans lived in
large cave complexes

00:03:41.619 --> 00:03:45.047
as agriculture allowed them
to grow their population.

00:03:45.047 --> 00:03:51.600
In the Northwest,
fishing in the Pacific Ocean

00:03:51.628 --> 00:03:55.686
gave Native Americans a
plentiful source of food,

00:03:55.686 --> 00:04:03.093
while farming allowed the Mississippian peoples

00:04:03.093 --> 00:04:06.988
to develop large
settlements, like Cahokia,

00:04:06.988 --> 00:04:10.355
near modern day St.
Louis, which, at its peak,

00:04:10.355 --> 00:04:16.200
may have had as many as 25,000-40,000 residents.

00:04:16.220 --> 00:04:19.898
The Mississippians and other
East Coast native peoples

00:04:19.898 --> 00:04:25.100
relied a lot on what's known
as three-sister farming,

00:04:25.162 --> 00:04:36.300
in which people would plant 
corn, beans and squash together,

00:04:36.351 --> 00:04:41.193
which was mutually beneficial
to all three plants,

00:04:41.200 --> 00:04:47.500
as the corn served as a trellis for the beans,

00:04:47.600 --> 00:04:55.640
and the squash protected the root system of the corn.

00:04:55.740 --> 00:04:58.957
All three together create
a very nutritious diet,

00:04:58.957 --> 00:05:02.013
which allowed for a relatively
high population density

00:05:02.013 --> 00:05:03.270
on the East Coast.

00:05:03.270 --> 00:05:06.347
So by the time that
Europeans began to arrive

00:05:06.347 --> 00:05:09.424
in the late 1400s and 1500s,

00:05:09.424 --> 00:05:14.285
native societies had been
evolving for over 14,000 years.

00:05:14.285 --> 00:05:18.019
But the introduction of
European people, pathogens,

00:05:18.019 --> 00:05:20.259
plants, and animals would introduce

00:05:20.259 --> 00:05:24.077
an unprecedented amount
of change in the Americas.
