00:00:00.500 --> 00:00:04.880
Let's talk a little
bit about congruence.

00:00:04.880 --> 00:00:06.510
And one way to think
about congruence,

00:00:06.510 --> 00:00:09.540
it's really a kind of
equivalence for shape.

00:00:09.540 --> 00:00:12.120
So in algebra when something
is equal to another thing,

00:00:12.120 --> 00:00:13.960
it means that their
quantities are the same.

00:00:13.960 --> 00:00:16.209
But if we're now all of a
sudden talking about shapes,

00:00:16.209 --> 00:00:22.832
and we say that those shapes
are the same size and shape,

00:00:22.832 --> 00:00:24.290
then we say that
they're congruent.

00:00:24.290 --> 00:00:26.830
And just to see a
simple example here.

00:00:26.830 --> 00:00:30.060
I have this triangle
right over there.

00:00:30.060 --> 00:00:33.700
And let's say I have this
triangle right over here.

00:00:33.700 --> 00:00:38.520
And if you are able
to shift this triangle

00:00:38.520 --> 00:00:41.120
and rotate this triangle
and flip this triangle,

00:00:41.120 --> 00:00:43.500
you can make it look
exactly like this triangle.

00:00:43.500 --> 00:00:45.520
As long as you're not
changing the lengths

00:00:45.520 --> 00:00:47.220
of any of the sides
or the angles here.

00:00:47.220 --> 00:00:52.311
But you can flip it, you
can shift it, and rotate it.

00:00:52.311 --> 00:00:53.060
Let me write this.

00:00:53.060 --> 00:00:58.360
You can shift it, you can
flip it, and you can rotate.

00:00:58.360 --> 00:01:00.800
If you can do those
three procedures to make

00:01:00.800 --> 00:01:03.360
these the exact same triangle,
to make them look exactly

00:01:03.360 --> 00:01:06.170
the same, then
they are congruent.

00:01:06.170 --> 00:01:08.290
And if you say that a
triangle is congruent--

00:01:08.290 --> 00:01:09.240
let me label these.

00:01:09.240 --> 00:01:14.090
So let's call this
triangle A, B, and C.

00:01:14.090 --> 00:01:22.180
And let's call this
X, Y, and Z. So

00:01:22.180 --> 00:01:24.340
if we were to say,
if we make the claim,

00:01:24.340 --> 00:01:26.530
that both of these
triangles are congruent,

00:01:26.530 --> 00:01:30.809
so if we say triangle
ABC is congruent--

00:01:30.809 --> 00:01:32.600
and the way you specify
it, it looks almost

00:01:32.600 --> 00:01:34.260
like an equal sign,
but it's an equal sign

00:01:34.260 --> 00:01:35.760
with this little
curly thing on top.

00:01:35.760 --> 00:01:37.640
Let me write a
little bit neater.

00:01:37.640 --> 00:01:39.600
So we would write it like this.

00:01:39.600 --> 00:01:48.070
If we know that triangle ABC
is congruent to triangle XYZ,

00:01:48.070 --> 00:01:50.860
that means that their
corresponding sides have

00:01:50.860 --> 00:01:55.270
the same length, and
their corresponding angles

00:01:55.270 --> 00:01:56.760
have the same measure.

00:01:56.760 --> 00:01:59.960
So if we make this assumption,
or if someone tells us

00:01:59.960 --> 00:02:04.270
that this is true, then
we know, for example,

00:02:04.270 --> 00:02:06.540
that AB is going
to be equal to XY.

00:02:06.540 --> 00:02:08.820
The length of
segment AB is going

00:02:08.820 --> 00:02:12.010
to be equal to the
length of segment XY.

00:02:12.010 --> 00:02:14.030
And we could denote
it like this.

00:02:14.030 --> 00:02:17.140
And I'm assuming that these
are the corresponding sides.

00:02:17.140 --> 00:02:19.220
And you can see it,
actually, by the way

00:02:19.220 --> 00:02:20.800
we've defined these triangles.

00:02:20.800 --> 00:02:24.510
A corresponds to X,
B corresponds to Y,

00:02:24.510 --> 00:02:27.440
and then C corresponds
to Z right over there.

00:02:27.440 --> 00:02:31.564
So side AB is going to have
the same length as side XY.

00:02:31.564 --> 00:02:33.730
And you can sometimes, if
you don't have the colors,

00:02:33.730 --> 00:02:35.960
you would denote
it just like that.

00:02:35.960 --> 00:02:40.830
These two line segments
have the same length.

00:02:40.830 --> 00:02:43.310
And you could actually say
this, and you don't always

00:02:43.310 --> 00:02:47.230
see it written this way, you
could also make the statement

00:02:47.230 --> 00:02:53.940
that line segment AB is
congruent to line segment XY.

00:02:53.940 --> 00:02:56.670
But congruence of
line segments really

00:02:56.670 --> 00:02:59.650
just means that their
lengths are equivalent.

00:02:59.650 --> 00:03:01.957
So these two things
mean the same thing.

00:03:01.957 --> 00:03:04.540
If one line segment is congruent
to another line segment, that

00:03:04.540 --> 00:03:06.360
just means the measure
of one line segment

00:03:06.360 --> 00:03:09.104
is equal to the measure
of the other line segment.

00:03:09.104 --> 00:03:11.270
And so we can go through
all the corresponding sides

00:03:11.270 --> 00:03:13.430
if these two characters
are congruent.

00:03:13.430 --> 00:03:23.120
We also know the length of BC
is going to be the length of YZ,

00:03:23.120 --> 00:03:25.820
assuming that those are
the corresponding sides.

00:03:25.820 --> 00:03:28.180
And we could put these double
hash marks right over here

00:03:28.180 --> 00:03:31.760
to show that these two
lengths are the same.

00:03:31.760 --> 00:03:34.160
And then if we go
to the third side,

00:03:34.160 --> 00:03:37.230
we also know that these are
going to have the same length,

00:03:37.230 --> 00:03:40.730
or the line segments themselves
are going to be congruent.

00:03:40.730 --> 00:03:44.220
So we also know that
the length of AC

00:03:44.220 --> 00:03:47.220
is going to be equal
to the length of XZ.

00:03:50.770 --> 00:03:53.767
Not only do we know that all the
corresponding sides are going

00:03:53.767 --> 00:03:55.600
to have the same length,
if someone tells us

00:03:55.600 --> 00:03:57.400
that a triangle is
congruent, we also

00:03:57.400 --> 00:03:59.120
know that all the
corresponding angles

00:03:59.120 --> 00:04:01.070
are going to have
the same measure.

00:04:01.070 --> 00:04:06.130
So for example, we also know
that this angle's measure

00:04:06.130 --> 00:04:09.710
is going to be the same as the
corresponding angle's measure.

00:04:09.710 --> 00:04:12.060
The corresponding angle
is right over here.

00:04:12.060 --> 00:04:14.290
It's between this orange
side and this blue side.

00:04:14.290 --> 00:04:16.779
Or this orange side and this
purple side, I should say.

00:04:16.779 --> 00:04:19.390
In between this orange
side and this purple side.

00:04:19.390 --> 00:04:27.680
And so it also tells us that
the measure of angle BAC

00:04:27.680 --> 00:04:34.112
is equal to the
measure of angle YXZ.

00:04:34.112 --> 00:04:36.320
Let me write that angle
symbol a little less like a--

00:04:41.570 --> 00:04:45.910
We could also write
that, as angle BAC

00:04:45.910 --> 00:04:50.180
is congruent to angle YXZ.

00:04:50.180 --> 00:04:51.970
And once again,
like line segments,

00:04:51.970 --> 00:04:55.210
if one line segment is congruent
to another line segment,

00:04:55.210 --> 00:04:57.250
it just means that
their lengths are equal.

00:04:57.250 --> 00:04:59.990
And if one angle is
congruent to another angle,

00:04:59.990 --> 00:05:02.755
it just means that their
measures are equal.

00:05:02.755 --> 00:05:04.880
So we know that those two
corresponding angles have

00:05:04.880 --> 00:05:07.000
the same measure,
they're congruent.

00:05:07.000 --> 00:05:09.260
We also know that these two
corresponding angles have

00:05:09.260 --> 00:05:11.051
the same measure, and
I'll use a double arc

00:05:11.051 --> 00:05:13.790
to specify that this has
the same measure as that.

00:05:13.790 --> 00:05:21.970
So we also know that
the measure of angle ABC

00:05:21.970 --> 00:05:24.940
is equal to the
measure of angle XYZ.

00:05:27.970 --> 00:05:33.910
And then finally, we
know that this angle,

00:05:33.910 --> 00:05:36.036
if we know that these two
characters are congruent,

00:05:36.036 --> 00:05:38.701
that this angle is going to have
the same measure as this angle,

00:05:38.701 --> 00:05:40.110
as its corresponding angle.

00:05:40.110 --> 00:05:46.280
So we know that the
measure of angle ACB

00:05:46.280 --> 00:05:49.510
is going to be equal to
the measure of angle XZY.

00:05:53.067 --> 00:05:55.400
Now what we're going to concern
ourselves a lot with, is

00:05:55.400 --> 00:05:56.681
how do we prove congruence?

00:05:56.681 --> 00:05:58.930
Because it's cool, because
if you can prove congruence

00:05:58.930 --> 00:06:00.750
of two triangles,
then all of a sudden

00:06:00.750 --> 00:06:02.960
you can make all of
these assumptions.

00:06:02.960 --> 00:06:06.280
And what we're going to find
out, and this is going to be,

00:06:06.280 --> 00:06:08.350
we're going to assume
it for the sake of kind

00:06:08.350 --> 00:06:10.020
of an introductory
geometry course

00:06:10.020 --> 00:06:12.227
that this is an axiom,
or postulate, or just

00:06:12.227 --> 00:06:13.310
something that you assume.

00:06:13.310 --> 00:06:15.410
And let me actually
just write this down.

00:06:15.410 --> 00:06:19.350
So an axiom, very fancy word.

00:06:19.350 --> 00:06:22.340
Postulate, also a
very fancy word.

00:06:22.340 --> 00:06:25.760
It really just means things that
we're going to assume are true.

00:06:25.760 --> 00:06:28.590
An axiom is sometimes, there's
a little bit of distinction

00:06:28.590 --> 00:06:31.120
sometimes, where someone will
say an axiom is something

00:06:31.120 --> 00:06:34.850
that's self-evident, or it
seems like a universal truth

00:06:34.850 --> 00:06:36.090
that is definitely true.

00:06:36.090 --> 00:06:37.423
And we just take it for granted.

00:06:37.423 --> 00:06:38.760
You can't prove an axiom.

00:06:38.760 --> 00:06:41.024
A postulate kind of
has that same role,

00:06:41.024 --> 00:06:42.440
but sometimes you
could say, well,

00:06:42.440 --> 00:06:44.410
let's just assume
this is true and see,

00:06:44.410 --> 00:06:47.070
if we assume that that's true,
what we can derive from it.

00:06:47.070 --> 00:06:49.500
What we can prove if
we assume it's true.

00:06:49.500 --> 00:06:52.210
But for the sake of a
introductory geometry class,

00:06:52.210 --> 00:06:53.680
and really in most
of mathematics

00:06:53.680 --> 00:06:55.970
today, these two words
are used interchangeably.

00:06:55.970 --> 00:06:58.820
An axiom or postulate,
just very fancy words

00:06:58.820 --> 00:07:00.550
for things that we
take as a given.

00:07:00.550 --> 00:07:02.170
Things that we just will assume.

00:07:02.170 --> 00:07:03.150
We won't prove them.

00:07:03.150 --> 00:07:05.170
We will start with
these assumptions,

00:07:05.170 --> 00:07:07.500
and then we're just going
to build up from there.

00:07:07.500 --> 00:07:09.890
And one of the core ones
that we'll see in geometry

00:07:09.890 --> 00:07:14.920
is the axiom, or the postulate,
that if all the sides are

00:07:14.920 --> 00:07:17.710
congruent, or if the lengths of
all the sides of the triangle

00:07:17.710 --> 00:07:21.120
are congruent,
then we are dealing

00:07:21.120 --> 00:07:22.740
with congruent triangles.

00:07:22.740 --> 00:07:26.040
So it's sometimes called
a side-side-side postulate

00:07:26.040 --> 00:07:27.046
or axiom.

00:07:27.046 --> 00:07:28.420
We're not going
to prove it here.

00:07:28.420 --> 00:07:29.630
We're just going to
take it as a given.

00:07:29.630 --> 00:07:31.463
So this literally stands
for side-side-side.

00:07:35.810 --> 00:07:44.286
And what it tells us is, if
we have two triangles-- and so

00:07:44.286 --> 00:07:46.160
let's say that's, and
that's another triangle

00:07:46.160 --> 00:07:49.710
right over there-- and we
know that corresponding sides

00:07:49.710 --> 00:07:50.880
are equal.

00:07:50.880 --> 00:07:54.310
So we know that this side right
over here is equal in length

00:07:54.310 --> 00:07:59.060
to that side, we know that
this side right over here

00:07:59.060 --> 00:08:02.300
is equal in length to that
side right over there,

00:08:02.300 --> 00:08:07.470
and we know that this side
over here is equal in length

00:08:07.470 --> 00:08:09.510
to this side over here.

00:08:09.510 --> 00:08:11.400
Then we know, and
we're just going

00:08:11.400 --> 00:08:15.050
to take this as an assumption,
and can build up off of this,

00:08:15.050 --> 00:08:17.030
we know that they are congruent.

00:08:17.030 --> 00:08:21.384
That these two triangles
are congruent to each other.

00:08:21.384 --> 00:08:23.800
I didn't put any labels there,
so it's kind of hard for me

00:08:23.800 --> 00:08:24.870
to refer to them.

00:08:24.870 --> 00:08:26.660
But these two are
congruent triangles.

00:08:26.660 --> 00:08:28.118
What's powerful
there is if we know

00:08:28.118 --> 00:08:30.030
all the corresponding
sides are equal,

00:08:30.030 --> 00:08:31.270
then we know they're
congruent, and then we

00:08:31.270 --> 00:08:32.978
can make all the other
assumptions, which

00:08:32.978 --> 00:08:36.240
means that the corresponding
angles are also equal.

00:08:36.240 --> 00:08:38.809
So that we know that that's
going to be congruent to that,

00:08:38.809 --> 00:08:40.190
or have the same measure.

00:08:40.190 --> 00:08:42.539
That's going to have the
same measure as that.

00:08:42.539 --> 00:08:45.460
And then that is going
to have the same measure

00:08:45.460 --> 00:08:47.370
as that right over there.

00:08:47.370 --> 00:08:52.110
And to see why that
is a reasonable axiom,

00:08:52.110 --> 00:08:54.830
or a reasonable assumption,
or a reasonable postulate

00:08:54.830 --> 00:08:59.590
to start off with, let's
start with one triangle.

00:08:59.590 --> 00:09:01.720
So let's say I have this
triangle right over here.

00:09:01.720 --> 00:09:04.980
So it has that side, and
then it has that side,

00:09:04.980 --> 00:09:07.630
and then it has that
side right over here.

00:09:07.630 --> 00:09:11.840
And what I'm going to do is see,
if I have another triangle that

00:09:11.840 --> 00:09:15.080
has the exact same side
lengths, is there any way for me

00:09:15.080 --> 00:09:18.250
to construct a triangle with
the same side lengths that

00:09:18.250 --> 00:09:21.110
is different, that can't be
translated to this triangle

00:09:21.110 --> 00:09:23.720
through flipping,
shifting, or rotating.

00:09:23.720 --> 00:09:25.870
So we assume this
other triangle's

00:09:25.870 --> 00:09:28.380
going to have a side that's
the same length as that one

00:09:28.380 --> 00:09:29.480
right over there.

00:09:29.480 --> 00:09:31.580
So I'll try to
draw it like that.

00:09:31.580 --> 00:09:33.100
Roughly the same length.

00:09:33.100 --> 00:09:38.271
We know it's going to have
a side that's that length.

00:09:38.271 --> 00:09:39.770
Let me put on this
side just to make

00:09:39.770 --> 00:09:41.970
it look a little bit
more interesting.

00:09:41.970 --> 00:09:44.760
So we know it's going to
have a side like that.

00:09:44.760 --> 00:09:46.760
So I'm going to draw it
roughly the same length,

00:09:46.760 --> 00:09:48.760
but I'm going to try to
do it a different angle.

00:09:48.760 --> 00:09:52.490
Now we know it's going to have
a side that looks like that.

00:09:55.170 --> 00:09:57.280
And so let me, I'll
put it right over here.

00:09:57.280 --> 00:09:59.447
It's about that length
right over there.

00:09:59.447 --> 00:10:01.030
And so clearly, this
isn't a triangle.

00:10:01.030 --> 00:10:02.529
In order to make
it a triangle, I'll

00:10:02.529 --> 00:10:07.250
have to connect this point to
that point right over there.

00:10:07.250 --> 00:10:09.000
And really there's
only two ways to do it.

00:10:09.000 --> 00:10:12.380
I can rotate it around that
little hinge right over there.

00:10:12.380 --> 00:10:15.690
If I connect them
over here, then I'm

00:10:15.690 --> 00:10:22.520
going to get a triangle
that looks like this, which

00:10:22.520 --> 00:10:26.020
is really just a flipped--
am I visualizing it right?

00:10:26.020 --> 00:10:27.310
Yeah, just a flipped version.

00:10:27.310 --> 00:10:29.480
You can rotate it a
little bit back this way.

00:10:29.480 --> 00:10:31.000
But then you'd have the
magenta on this side

00:10:31.000 --> 00:10:32.166
and the yellow on this side.

00:10:32.166 --> 00:10:34.300
And you could flip
it vertically,

00:10:34.300 --> 00:10:36.140
and then it would look
exactly like this.

00:10:36.140 --> 00:10:39.050
Our other option to make
these two points connect,

00:10:39.050 --> 00:10:41.930
is to rotate them out this way.

00:10:41.930 --> 00:10:46.720
And then the yellow side
is going to be here,

00:10:46.720 --> 00:10:51.300
and then the magenta side is
going to be right over here.

00:10:51.300 --> 00:10:53.120
That's not magenta.

00:10:53.120 --> 00:10:56.934
The magenta side is going
to be just like that.

00:10:56.934 --> 00:10:58.600
And if we do that,
then we actually just

00:10:58.600 --> 00:11:02.792
have to rotate it around
to get that exact triangle.

00:11:02.792 --> 00:11:04.500
So this isn't a proof,
but actually we're

00:11:04.500 --> 00:11:06.806
going to start assuming
that this is an axiom.

00:11:06.806 --> 00:11:08.930
But hopefully you see that
it's a pretty reasonable

00:11:08.930 --> 00:11:12.000
starting point, that if
all of the sides, all

00:11:12.000 --> 00:11:14.440
the corresponding sides,
of two different triangles

00:11:14.440 --> 00:11:19.260
are equal, then we know
that they are congruent.

00:11:19.260 --> 00:11:21.470
We're just going to assume,
it is an axiom that we're

00:11:21.470 --> 00:11:23.386
going to build off of,
that they're congruent.

00:11:23.386 --> 00:11:25.850
And then we also know that
all the corresponding angles

00:11:25.850 --> 00:11:27.924
are going to be equivalent.
