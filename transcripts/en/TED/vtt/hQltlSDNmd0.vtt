00:00:13.122 --> 00:00:15.663
Imagine waking up to a stranger --

00:00:15.687 --> 00:00:18.133
sometimes multiple strangers --

00:00:18.939 --> 00:00:21.777
questioning your right to existence

00:00:21.801 --> 00:00:24.121
for something that you wrote online,

00:00:25.480 --> 00:00:28.801
waking up to an angry message,

00:00:28.825 --> 00:00:31.012
scared and worried for your safety.

00:00:31.975 --> 00:00:34.658
Welcome to the world of cyberharassment.

00:00:35.344 --> 00:00:39.275
The kind of harassment that women
face in Pakistan is very serious

00:00:39.299 --> 00:00:42.327
and leads to sometimes deadly outcomes.

00:00:43.066 --> 00:00:46.390
This kind of harassment keeps women
from accessing the internet --

00:00:46.414 --> 00:00:48.191
essentially, knowledge.

00:00:48.926 --> 00:00:51.217
It's a form of oppression.

00:00:52.819 --> 00:00:56.508
Pakistan is the sixth most populous
country in the world,

00:00:56.532 --> 00:01:00.356
with 140 million people having access
to mobile technologies,

00:01:00.380 --> 00:01:03.970
and 15 percent internet penetration.

00:01:05.256 --> 00:01:09.479
And this number doesn't seem to go down
with the rise of new technologies.

00:01:10.270 --> 00:01:15.559
Pakistan is also the birthplace
of the youngest Nobel Peace Prize winner,

00:01:15.583 --> 00:01:16.942
Malala Yousafzai.

00:01:18.438 --> 00:01:21.021
But that's just one aspect of Pakistan.

00:01:21.961 --> 00:01:26.124
Another aspect is where
the twisted concept of honor

00:01:26.148 --> 00:01:29.040
is linked to women and their bodies;

00:01:29.924 --> 00:01:33.159
where men are allowed to disrespect women

00:01:33.183 --> 00:01:35.000
and even kill them sometimes

00:01:35.024 --> 00:01:37.653
in the name of so-called "family honor";

00:01:38.522 --> 00:01:43.071
where women are left to die
right outside their houses

00:01:43.095 --> 00:01:45.683
for speaking to a man on a mobile phone,

00:01:45.707 --> 00:01:47.577
in the name of "family honor."

00:01:48.158 --> 00:01:49.929
Let me say this very clearly:

00:01:50.681 --> 00:01:52.146
it's not honor;

00:01:52.170 --> 00:01:54.526
it's a cold-blooded murder.

00:01:57.551 --> 00:02:01.702
I come from a very small village
in Punjab, Pakistan,

00:02:01.726 --> 00:02:06.600
where women are not allowed
to pursue their higher education.

00:02:07.308 --> 00:02:11.022
The elders of my extended family
didn't allow their women

00:02:11.046 --> 00:02:14.908
to pursue their higher education
or their professional careers.

00:02:14.932 --> 00:02:19.058
However, unlike the other
male guardians of my family,

00:02:19.082 --> 00:02:24.566
my father was one who really
supported my ambitions.

00:02:25.941 --> 00:02:27.627
To get my law degree,

00:02:28.344 --> 00:02:32.257
of course, it was really difficult,

00:02:32.281 --> 00:02:36.494
and [there were] frowns of disapproval.

00:02:37.373 --> 00:02:40.867
But in the end, I knew
it's either me or them,

00:02:40.891 --> 00:02:42.269
and I chose myself.

00:02:44.446 --> 00:02:49.007
(Applause)

00:02:50.673 --> 00:02:53.832
My family's traditions
and expectations for a woman

00:02:53.856 --> 00:02:56.777
wouldn't allow me to own a mobile
phone until I was married.

00:02:57.544 --> 00:02:59.627
And even when I was married,

00:02:59.651 --> 00:03:03.738
this tool became a tool
for my own surveillance.

00:03:04.923 --> 00:03:09.353
When I resisted this idea
of being surveilled by my ex-husband,

00:03:09.377 --> 00:03:11.066
he really didn't approve of this

00:03:11.090 --> 00:03:13.174
and threw me out of his house,

00:03:13.198 --> 00:03:16.570
along with my six-month-old
son, Abdullah.

00:03:17.436 --> 00:03:21.755
And that was the time
when I first asked myself, "Why?

00:03:21.779 --> 00:03:25.525
Why are women not allowed
to enjoy the same equal rights

00:03:25.549 --> 00:03:27.525
enshrined in our Constitution?

00:03:28.631 --> 00:03:32.581
While the law states that a woman
has the same equal access

00:03:32.605 --> 00:03:34.034
to the information,

00:03:34.058 --> 00:03:37.837
why is it always men -- brothers,
fathers and husbands --

00:03:37.861 --> 00:03:39.900
who are granting these rights to us,

00:03:39.924 --> 00:03:42.772
effectively making the law irrelevant?"

00:03:44.801 --> 00:03:46.558
So I decided to take a step,

00:03:46.582 --> 00:03:49.549
instead of keep questioning
these patriarchal structures

00:03:49.573 --> 00:03:50.892
and societal norms.

00:03:51.656 --> 00:03:55.636
And I founded the Digital Rights
Foundation in 2012

00:03:55.660 --> 00:04:02.112
to address all the issues
and women's experiences in online spaces

00:04:02.136 --> 00:04:03.600
and cyberharassment.

00:04:04.990 --> 00:04:08.917
From lobbying for free and safe internet

00:04:08.941 --> 00:04:10.404
to convincing young women

00:04:10.428 --> 00:04:15.654
that access to the safe internet
is their fundamental, basic, human right,

00:04:15.678 --> 00:04:18.608
I'm trying to play my part
in igniting the spark

00:04:18.632 --> 00:04:22.247
to address the questions
that have bothered me all these years.

00:04:22.955 --> 00:04:24.808
With a hope in my heart,

00:04:24.832 --> 00:04:27.398
and to offer a solution to this menace,

00:04:27.422 --> 00:04:31.804
I started Pakistan's and the region's
first cyberharassment help line

00:04:31.828 --> 00:04:33.644
in December 2016 --

00:04:33.668 --> 00:04:39.409
(Applause)

00:04:40.038 --> 00:04:44.311
to extend my support to the women
who do not know who to turn to

00:04:44.335 --> 00:04:47.018
when they face serious threats online.

00:04:47.757 --> 00:04:51.767
I think of the women who do not have
the necessary support

00:04:51.791 --> 00:04:57.345
to deal with the mental trauma
when they feel unsafe in online spaces,

00:04:57.369 --> 00:04:59.452
and they go about their daily activities,

00:04:59.476 --> 00:05:02.719
thinking that there is
a rape threat in their in-box.

00:05:03.329 --> 00:05:07.491
Safe access to the internet
is an access to knowledge,

00:05:07.515 --> 00:05:09.343
and knowledge is freedom.

00:05:09.367 --> 00:05:11.485
When I fight for women's digital rights,

00:05:11.509 --> 00:05:13.381
I'm fighting for equality.

00:05:13.405 --> 00:05:14.556
Thank you.

00:05:14.580 --> 00:05:16.523
(Applause)
