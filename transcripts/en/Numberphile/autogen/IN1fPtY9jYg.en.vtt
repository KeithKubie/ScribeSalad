there was a normal Queens I want to tell

00:00:10.790 --> 00:00:10.800
there was a normal Queens I want to tell
 

00:00:10.800 --> 00:00:13.009
there was a normal Queens I want to tell
you about peaceable Queens the question

00:00:13.009 --> 00:00:13.019
you about peaceable Queens the question
 

00:00:13.019 --> 00:00:14.839
you about peaceable Queens the question
is you have a chess board of a certain

00:00:14.839 --> 00:00:14.849
is you have a chess board of a certain
 

00:00:14.849 --> 00:00:18.590
is you have a chess board of a certain
size could be 8x8 or it could be 4x4 you

00:00:18.590 --> 00:00:18.600
size could be 8x8 or it could be 4x4 you
 

00:00:18.600 --> 00:00:20.540
size could be 8x8 or it could be 4x4 you
would like to put down as many Queens as

00:00:20.540 --> 00:00:20.550
would like to put down as many Queens as
 

00:00:20.550 --> 00:00:21.140
would like to put down as many Queens as
you can

00:00:21.140 --> 00:00:21.150
you can
 

00:00:21.150 --> 00:00:23.359
you can
some black Queens and some white Queens

00:00:23.359 --> 00:00:23.369
some black Queens and some white Queens
 

00:00:23.369 --> 00:00:26.900
some black Queens and some white Queens
but they must not attack each other two

00:00:26.900 --> 00:00:26.910
but they must not attack each other two
 

00:00:26.910 --> 00:00:28.820
but they must not attack each other two
constraints in this problem equal

00:00:28.820 --> 00:00:28.830
constraints in this problem equal
 

00:00:28.830 --> 00:00:32.359
constraints in this problem equal
numbers as many as possible and they do

00:00:32.359 --> 00:00:32.369
numbers as many as possible and they do
 

00:00:32.369 --> 00:00:35.080
numbers as many as possible and they do
not attack Queens of the opposite color

00:00:35.080 --> 00:00:35.090
not attack Queens of the opposite color
 

00:00:35.090 --> 00:00:39.260
not attack Queens of the opposite color
so this is a problem that Don Knuth told

00:00:39.260 --> 00:00:39.270
so this is a problem that Don Knuth told
 

00:00:39.270 --> 00:00:43.220
so this is a problem that Don Knuth told
me about in 2014 and I like the problem

00:00:43.220 --> 00:00:43.230
me about in 2014 and I like the problem
 

00:00:43.230 --> 00:00:45.229
me about in 2014 and I like the problem
a lot because it has some lovely

00:00:45.229 --> 00:00:45.239
a lot because it has some lovely
 

00:00:45.239 --> 00:00:48.020
a lot because it has some lovely
pictures it's an easily stated problem

00:00:48.020 --> 00:00:48.030
pictures it's an easily stated problem
 

00:00:48.030 --> 00:00:50.630
pictures it's an easily stated problem
and we don't know much about it and

00:00:50.630 --> 00:00:50.640
and we don't know much about it and
 

00:00:50.640 --> 00:00:53.420
and we don't know much about it and
there's a really incredible conjecture

00:00:53.420 --> 00:00:53.430
there's a really incredible conjecture
 

00:00:53.430 --> 00:00:54.950
there's a really incredible conjecture
suppose we have a four by four

00:00:54.950 --> 00:00:54.960
suppose we have a four by four
 

00:00:54.960 --> 00:00:57.049
suppose we have a four by four
chessboard and we want to put down black

00:00:57.049 --> 00:00:57.059
chessboard and we want to put down black
 

00:00:57.059 --> 00:00:59.060
chessboard and we want to put down black
Queens and white Queens so they don't

00:00:59.060 --> 00:00:59.070
Queens and white Queens so they don't
 

00:00:59.070 --> 00:01:01.189
Queens and white Queens so they don't
attack each other so if you put two

00:01:01.189 --> 00:01:01.199
attack each other so if you put two
 

00:01:01.199 --> 00:01:03.950
attack each other so if you put two
black Queens in the two corners and two

00:01:03.950 --> 00:01:03.960
black Queens in the two corners and two
 

00:01:03.960 --> 00:01:06.080
black Queens in the two corners and two
white Queens in the two middle squares

00:01:06.080 --> 00:01:06.090
white Queens in the two middle squares
 

00:01:06.090 --> 00:01:08.899
white Queens in the two middle squares
the black Queens do not attack the white

00:01:08.899 --> 00:01:08.909
the black Queens do not attack the white
 

00:01:08.909 --> 00:01:11.120
the black Queens do not attack the white
Queens and the white Queens don't attack

00:01:11.120 --> 00:01:11.130
Queens and the white Queens don't attack
 

00:01:11.130 --> 00:01:12.890
Queens and the white Queens don't attack
the black Queens immersed you can put

00:01:12.890 --> 00:01:12.900
the black Queens immersed you can put
 

00:01:12.900 --> 00:01:15.950
the black Queens immersed you can put
down as two there's no conflict when two

00:01:15.950 --> 00:01:15.960
down as two there's no conflict when two
 

00:01:15.960 --> 00:01:18.320
down as two there's no conflict when two
white Queens can see each other here the

00:01:18.320 --> 00:01:18.330
white Queens can see each other here the
 

00:01:18.330 --> 00:01:21.050
white Queens can see each other here the
white Queens want to avoid being seen by

00:01:21.050 --> 00:01:21.060
white Queens want to avoid being seen by
 

00:01:21.060 --> 00:01:23.090
white Queens want to avoid being seen by
the black Queens and vice versa this is

00:01:23.090 --> 00:01:23.100
the black Queens and vice versa this is
 

00:01:23.100 --> 00:01:25.520
the black Queens and vice versa this is
a lovely problem because it's really

00:01:25.520 --> 00:01:25.530
a lovely problem because it's really
 

00:01:25.530 --> 00:01:29.270
a lovely problem because it's really
really hard we know very few terms so

00:01:29.270 --> 00:01:29.280
really hard we know very few terms so
 

00:01:29.280 --> 00:01:30.770
really hard we know very few terms so
let me show you what we actually know

00:01:30.770 --> 00:01:30.780
let me show you what we actually know
 

00:01:30.780 --> 00:01:34.130
let me show you what we actually know
about this so for a two by two if you

00:01:34.130 --> 00:01:34.140
about this so for a two by two if you
 

00:01:34.140 --> 00:01:35.960
about this so for a two by two if you
put a black queen here it attacks the

00:01:35.960 --> 00:01:35.970
put a black queen here it attacks the
 

00:01:35.970 --> 00:01:38.420
put a black queen here it attacks the
other squares for one by one you can't

00:01:38.420 --> 00:01:38.430
other squares for one by one you can't
 

00:01:38.430 --> 00:01:41.899
other squares for one by one you can't
do anything so what we know is that for

00:01:41.899 --> 00:01:41.909
do anything so what we know is that for
 

00:01:41.909 --> 00:01:45.800
do anything so what we know is that for
a one by one the answer is zero for a

00:01:45.800 --> 00:01:45.810
a one by one the answer is zero for a
 

00:01:45.810 --> 00:01:48.230
a one by one the answer is zero for a
two by two the answer is zero what about

00:01:48.230 --> 00:01:48.240
two by two the answer is zero what about
 

00:01:48.240 --> 00:01:51.200
two by two the answer is zero what about
a three by three if we put a black queen

00:01:51.200 --> 00:01:51.210
a three by three if we put a black queen
 

00:01:51.210 --> 00:01:54.260
a three by three if we put a black queen
here it attacks all the squares except

00:01:54.260 --> 00:01:54.270
here it attacks all the squares except
 

00:01:54.270 --> 00:01:56.719
here it attacks all the squares except
these two so we could put a white queen

00:01:56.719 --> 00:01:56.729
these two so we could put a white queen
 

00:01:56.729 --> 00:01:58.459
these two so we could put a white queen
here we can put a white queen here too

00:01:58.459 --> 00:01:58.469
here we can put a white queen here too
 

00:01:58.469 --> 00:02:00.380
here we can put a white queen here too
but we'd have two white Queens and we

00:02:00.380 --> 00:02:00.390
but we'd have two white Queens and we
 

00:02:00.390 --> 00:02:02.420
but we'd have two white Queens and we
cannot put two black Queens so the

00:02:02.420 --> 00:02:02.430
cannot put two black Queens so the
 

00:02:02.430 --> 00:02:04.429
cannot put two black Queens so the
numbers have to be equal okay

00:02:04.429 --> 00:02:04.439
numbers have to be equal okay
 

00:02:04.439 --> 00:02:07.280
numbers have to be equal okay
all you can do is one one of each color

00:02:07.280 --> 00:02:07.290
all you can do is one one of each color
 

00:02:07.290 --> 00:02:11.030
all you can do is one one of each color
the Manx for its - - is the most we can

00:02:11.030 --> 00:02:11.040
the Manx for its - - is the most we can
 

00:02:11.040 --> 00:02:13.760
the Manx for its - - is the most we can
do so what about five there are actually

00:02:13.760 --> 00:02:13.770
do so what about five there are actually
 

00:02:13.770 --> 00:02:15.650
do so what about five there are actually
a lot of solutions to the 5x5

00:02:15.650 --> 00:02:15.660
a lot of solutions to the 5x5
 

00:02:15.660 --> 00:02:18.410
a lot of solutions to the 5x5
but there's one which is overwhelmingly

00:02:18.410 --> 00:02:18.420
but there's one which is overwhelmingly
 

00:02:18.420 --> 00:02:22.100
but there's one which is overwhelmingly
nice and you put four at the corners and

00:02:22.100 --> 00:02:22.110
nice and you put four at the corners and
 

00:02:22.110 --> 00:02:25.130
nice and you put four at the corners and
you put four in the other obvious places

00:02:25.130 --> 00:02:25.140
you put four in the other obvious places
 

00:02:25.140 --> 00:02:30.590
you put four in the other obvious places
there there there and there and you see

00:02:30.590 --> 00:02:30.600
there there there and there and you see
 

00:02:30.600 --> 00:02:32.990
there there there and there and you see
they cleverly avoid each other and you

00:02:32.990 --> 00:02:33.000
they cleverly avoid each other and you
 

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:35.900
they cleverly avoid each other and you
can't do more so for five the answer is

00:02:35.900 --> 00:02:35.910
can't do more so for five the answer is
 

00:02:35.910 --> 00:02:41.030
can't do more so for five the answer is
four for six you can do five four seven

00:02:41.030 --> 00:02:41.040
four for six you can do five four seven
 

00:02:41.040 --> 00:02:44.540
four for six you can do five four seven
I think you can do seven on a regular

00:02:44.540 --> 00:02:44.550
I think you can do seven on a regular
 

00:02:44.550 --> 00:02:46.850
I think you can do seven on a regular
chess board you can do nine now in black

00:02:46.850 --> 00:02:46.860
chess board you can do nine now in black
 

00:02:46.860 --> 00:02:49.550
chess board you can do nine now in black
nine white and they don't attack each

00:02:49.550 --> 00:02:49.560
nine white and they don't attack each
 

00:02:49.560 --> 00:02:53.300
nine white and they don't attack each
other and you notice they come in clumps

00:02:53.300 --> 00:02:53.310
other and you notice they come in clumps
 

00:02:53.310 --> 00:02:56.300
other and you notice they come in clumps
and that seems to be a very good way to

00:02:56.300 --> 00:02:56.310
and that seems to be a very good way to
 

00:02:56.310 --> 00:02:58.790
and that seems to be a very good way to
do it if you go to a bigger board then

00:02:58.790 --> 00:02:58.800
do it if you go to a bigger board then
 

00:02:58.800 --> 00:03:04.120
do it if you go to a bigger board then
for nine we can do twelve ten fourteen

00:03:04.120 --> 00:03:04.130
for nine we can do twelve ten fourteen
 

00:03:04.130 --> 00:03:07.820
for nine we can do twelve ten fourteen
for an 11 by 11 board you can put 17

00:03:07.820 --> 00:03:07.830
for an 11 by 11 board you can put 17
 

00:03:07.830 --> 00:03:11.979
for an 11 by 11 board you can put 17
black Queens and 17 white Queens

black Queens and 17 white Queens
 

00:03:11.989 --> 00:03:18.830
black Queens and 17 white Queens
12:21 and 13 24 and very recently just a

couple of weeks ago someone found the

00:03:21.890 --> 00:03:21.900
couple of weeks ago someone found the
 

00:03:21.900 --> 00:03:26.570
couple of weeks ago someone found the
next term which is 28 beyond this we

00:03:26.570 --> 00:03:26.580
next term which is 28 beyond this we
 

00:03:26.580 --> 00:03:29.180
next term which is 28 beyond this we
don't know you can use things like

00:03:29.180 --> 00:03:29.190
don't know you can use things like
 

00:03:29.190 --> 00:03:33.259
don't know you can use things like
simulated annealing to run to get lower

00:03:33.259 --> 00:03:33.269
simulated annealing to run to get lower
 

00:03:33.269 --> 00:03:34.910

bounds to get things that look pretty

00:03:34.910 --> 00:03:34.920
bounds to get things that look pretty
 

00:03:34.920 --> 00:03:37.400
bounds to get things that look pretty
good and maybe optimal and you can use

00:03:37.400 --> 00:03:37.410
good and maybe optimal and you can use
 

00:03:37.410 --> 00:03:39.920
good and maybe optimal and you can use
integer programming to get upper bounds

00:03:39.920 --> 00:03:39.930
integer programming to get upper bounds
 

00:03:39.930 --> 00:03:41.720
integer programming to get upper bounds
to show that you can't get more than

00:03:41.720 --> 00:03:41.730
to show that you can't get more than
 

00:03:41.730 --> 00:03:44.600
to show that you can't get more than
such-and-such but the exact value is not

00:03:44.600 --> 00:03:44.610
such-and-such but the exact value is not
 

00:03:44.610 --> 00:03:46.699
such-and-such but the exact value is not
known beyond that point although we have

00:03:46.699 --> 00:03:46.709
known beyond that point although we have
 

00:03:46.709 --> 00:03:48.290
known beyond that point although we have
some conjectures so here is a very

00:03:48.290 --> 00:03:48.300
some conjectures so here is a very
 

00:03:48.300 --> 00:03:50.990
some conjectures so here is a very
plausible looking solution which has 58

00:03:50.990 --> 00:03:51.000
plausible looking solution which has 58
 

00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:54.110

black Queens and 58 white Queens on a

00:03:54.110 --> 00:03:54.120
black Queens and 58 white Queens on a
 

00:03:54.120 --> 00:03:56.420
black Queens and 58 white Queens on a
twenty by twenty board and this is a

00:03:56.420 --> 00:03:56.430
twenty by twenty board and this is a
 

00:03:56.430 --> 00:03:58.340
twenty by twenty board and this is a
construction which says if you

00:03:58.340 --> 00:03:58.350
construction which says if you
 

00:03:58.350 --> 00:04:01.340
construction which says if you
generalize this and put the Queen's into

00:04:01.340 --> 00:04:01.350
generalize this and put the Queen's into
 

00:04:01.350 --> 00:04:04.130
generalize this and put the Queen's into
fork five sided clumps a clump here a

00:04:04.130 --> 00:04:04.140
fork five sided clumps a clump here a
 

00:04:04.140 --> 00:04:06.020
fork five sided clumps a clump here a
clump here a clump here and a come here

00:04:06.020 --> 00:04:06.030
clump here a clump here and a come here
 

00:04:06.030 --> 00:04:09.650
clump here a clump here and a come here
