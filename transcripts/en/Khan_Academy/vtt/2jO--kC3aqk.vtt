00:00:00.480 --> 00:00:04.360
In the video on E2 reactions,
I showed you how a strong

00:00:04.360 --> 00:00:06.630
base-- and all of this happened
simultaneously-- a

00:00:06.630 --> 00:00:10.980
strong base can nab a hydrogen
off of this carbon right here.

00:00:10.980 --> 00:00:13.570
And it's just nabbing
the proton itself.

00:00:13.570 --> 00:00:16.200
It's not grabbing the hydrogen
and the electron.

00:00:16.200 --> 00:00:19.970
And then that electron goes to
this carbon right over there,

00:00:19.970 --> 00:00:22.470
and then that allows that
carbon to give away the

00:00:22.470 --> 00:00:25.660
electron that was forming a bond
with the chlorine to go

00:00:25.660 --> 00:00:26.310
with the chlorine.

00:00:26.310 --> 00:00:28.300
This all happened at once.

00:00:28.300 --> 00:00:31.140
The chloride got eliminated.

00:00:31.140 --> 00:00:35.020
Now, one thing that might pop
out in your brain is why did I

00:00:35.020 --> 00:00:36.510
pick this hydrogen?

00:00:36.510 --> 00:00:39.850
Why did I pick the hydrogen
right over here?

00:00:39.850 --> 00:00:44.550
Why couldn't I have picked
that hydrogen over there?

00:00:44.550 --> 00:00:46.010
And I'm going to introduce you
to a little bit of terminology

00:00:46.010 --> 00:00:47.750
and then I'll introduce
you to a rule.

00:00:47.750 --> 00:00:50.350
And then I'll tell you a little
bit about why people

00:00:50.350 --> 00:00:52.290
think this rule works.

00:00:52.290 --> 00:00:56.100
So in general, the carbon that
has the functional group on

00:00:56.100 --> 00:00:57.960
it, that's the alpha carbon.

00:00:57.960 --> 00:00:59.020
So let me label it.

00:00:59.020 --> 00:01:01.920
This carbon right here
is the alpha carbon.

00:01:01.920 --> 00:01:06.420
And in order to have an E2
reaction in this case, when we

00:01:06.420 --> 00:01:08.855
did the video on E2 reactions,
but actually, the rule will

00:01:08.855 --> 00:01:10.890
hold as well for E1 reactions.

00:01:10.890 --> 00:01:14.040
But in order to have the E2
reaction, the hydrogen has to

00:01:14.040 --> 00:01:16.530
get swiped off of
a beta carbon.

00:01:16.530 --> 00:01:19.280
And a beta carbon is just a
carbon that's one away from

00:01:19.280 --> 00:01:20.150
the alpha carbon.

00:01:20.150 --> 00:01:24.000
So this is a beta carbon and
this is also a beta carbon.

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:27.050
And so it's completely
reasonable one would think

00:01:27.050 --> 00:01:29.840
that, well, I could swipe it
from there or I could swipe it

00:01:29.840 --> 00:01:30.440
from there.

00:01:30.440 --> 00:01:31.770
And let's think about
this reaction.

00:01:31.770 --> 00:01:33.520
Let's just draw it out, so
you can visualize it

00:01:33.520 --> 00:01:34.650
a little bit better.

00:01:34.650 --> 00:01:36.940
So here we swiped it from
this beta carbon.

00:01:36.940 --> 00:01:40.220
Let me redraw the reaction where
we're swiping it from

00:01:40.220 --> 00:01:43.350
the other beta carbons.

00:01:43.350 --> 00:01:48.110
I want both reactions on the
screen at the same time.

00:01:48.110 --> 00:01:50.430
Let me draw our methoxide.

00:01:50.430 --> 00:01:57.050
So we have our oxygen bonded
to a CH3 to a methyl group.

00:01:57.050 --> 00:02:03.040
The oxygen has seven valence
electrons: one, two, three,

00:02:03.040 --> 00:02:06.150
four, five, six, seven.

00:02:06.150 --> 00:02:09.229
I'll do the seventh one.

00:02:09.229 --> 00:02:11.810
The one that will bond
with the hydrogen,

00:02:11.810 --> 00:02:13.260
I'll do it in green.

00:02:13.260 --> 00:02:15.550
Instead of attacking that
hydrogen or taking that

00:02:15.550 --> 00:02:17.590
proton, I should say, because
it's not taking the electron

00:02:17.590 --> 00:02:19.460
with it, it does
it to this one.

00:02:19.460 --> 00:02:24.210
So what it does is it takes this
proton or it bonds with

00:02:24.210 --> 00:02:28.850
that hydrogen proton, and then
the hydrogen protons or that

00:02:28.850 --> 00:02:33.280
hydrogen's electron can then be
taken by this molecule, so

00:02:33.280 --> 00:02:37.710
then it goes to the alpha carbon
to form a double bond

00:02:37.710 --> 00:02:40.560
between this beta carbon
and the alpha carbon.

00:02:40.560 --> 00:02:43.280
And so now, this alpha carbon
got that electron.

00:02:43.280 --> 00:02:49.460
It doesn't need the electron
that's bonded with the chloro

00:02:49.460 --> 00:02:51.640
group anymore, and so
that goes to the

00:02:51.640 --> 00:02:54.700
chlorine to form chloride.

00:02:54.700 --> 00:02:56.850
Chlorine was already way
more electronegative.

00:02:56.850 --> 00:02:57.940
It was already hogging it.

00:02:57.940 --> 00:02:59.630
Now it gets to go there.

00:02:59.630 --> 00:03:02.030
And now, when all is
said and done, our

00:03:02.030 --> 00:03:05.050
products look like this.

00:03:05.050 --> 00:03:07.650
So we still have the methanol
just like we had in the

00:03:07.650 --> 00:03:10.650
original reaction because this
grabbed this hydrogen.

00:03:10.650 --> 00:03:11.370
Let me draw it.

00:03:11.370 --> 00:03:13.175
So you have your OCH3.

00:03:15.770 --> 00:03:17.170
Let me draw all of this in.

00:03:17.170 --> 00:03:19.500
You have that pair
right over there.

00:03:19.500 --> 00:03:22.570
You have this pair
right over here.

00:03:22.570 --> 00:03:26.880
And then you have this purple
electron and now it's bonded

00:03:26.880 --> 00:03:30.690
with this green electron, which
is now on the hydrogen.

00:03:30.690 --> 00:03:35.430
So it is now bonded with this
green electron that has been

00:03:35.430 --> 00:03:37.580
given to the hydrogen.

00:03:37.580 --> 00:03:39.820
Oh, and make sure
we don't forget.

00:03:39.820 --> 00:03:42.370
This oxygen over here had seven
valence electrons, so it

00:03:42.370 --> 00:03:43.610
had a negative charge.

00:03:43.610 --> 00:03:45.440
Neutral oxygen would have six.

00:03:45.440 --> 00:03:47.340
So this had a negative charge.

00:03:47.340 --> 00:03:50.800
But now that it gave its
electron to this hydrogen, it

00:03:50.800 --> 00:03:52.140
now has a neutral charge.

00:03:52.140 --> 00:03:53.170
It is now methanol.

00:03:53.170 --> 00:03:55.800
Exactly what we saw
when we first

00:03:55.800 --> 00:03:57.510
learned about E1 reactions.

00:03:57.510 --> 00:04:00.880
We also know the chloro group,
it took that electron.

00:04:00.880 --> 00:04:03.120
It's now a chloride anion.

00:04:03.120 --> 00:04:04.500
So let me draw that.

00:04:04.500 --> 00:04:06.730
And that's exactly the
same as in the

00:04:06.730 --> 00:04:09.160
first video on E1 reactions.

00:04:09.160 --> 00:04:13.400
So it's now a chloride anion.

00:04:13.400 --> 00:04:15.100
It has grabbed this
orange electron.

00:04:18.674 --> 00:04:20.779
Let me do it in orange.

00:04:20.779 --> 00:04:24.190
It has grabbed this orange
electron, so it now has a

00:04:24.190 --> 00:04:24.930
negative charge.

00:04:24.930 --> 00:04:27.020
You can imagine that the
negative charge has been

00:04:27.020 --> 00:04:30.970
transferred from the methoxide
to the chloride anion.

00:04:30.970 --> 00:04:33.550
And now what's different this
time is that the double bond

00:04:33.550 --> 00:04:36.760
is now between the one and the
two carbon and not between the

00:04:36.760 --> 00:04:38.490
two and the three carbon.

00:04:38.490 --> 00:04:40.550
So now it's going to
look like this.

00:04:40.550 --> 00:04:44.160
So now, the result of this
product, if the reaction went

00:04:44.160 --> 00:04:45.400
this way would look like this.

00:04:45.400 --> 00:04:47.670
We have this carbon
right here.

00:04:47.670 --> 00:04:48.920
It is bonded to two hydrogens.

00:04:51.840 --> 00:04:54.520
Now, it has a double bond
with this carbon.

00:04:54.520 --> 00:04:56.750
It has a double bond, and
I'll do the second bond.

00:04:56.750 --> 00:05:01.290
I'll do the pi bond of the
double bond in purple right

00:05:01.290 --> 00:05:01.910
over there.

00:05:01.910 --> 00:05:03.440
I'll assume that that's
the pi bond.

00:05:03.440 --> 00:05:05.080
That's the new double
bond form.

00:05:05.080 --> 00:05:10.660
And now this carbon, which
was the alpha carbon,

00:05:10.660 --> 00:05:12.410
is right over here.

00:05:12.410 --> 00:05:13.530
This was the alpha carbon.

00:05:13.530 --> 00:05:15.460
It's bonded to one hydrogen.

00:05:15.460 --> 00:05:17.050
And then let me draw
everything else.

00:05:17.050 --> 00:05:19.200
So then you have a
carbon, a carbon.

00:05:19.200 --> 00:05:21.090
This guy is bonded to
three hydrogens.

00:05:21.090 --> 00:05:24.280
I could have just written
it as CH3 if I wanted.

00:05:24.280 --> 00:05:26.430
This guy's bonded to
two hydrogens.

00:05:26.430 --> 00:05:27.290
And we're done.

00:05:27.290 --> 00:05:30.140
So instead of, as we saw on
the first video on E2

00:05:30.140 --> 00:05:34.300
reactions, instead of forming
but-2-ene, we now have-- it's

00:05:34.300 --> 00:05:37.410
still one, two, three four
carbons, so it's still but-,

00:05:37.410 --> 00:05:41.380
but the double bond is
on the one carbon.

00:05:41.380 --> 00:05:45.060
We'd start one, two, three,
four, So we could call this

00:05:45.060 --> 00:05:47.690
but-1-ene or 1-butene,
either way.

00:05:47.690 --> 00:05:48.940
So let's call this but-1-ene.

00:05:52.300 --> 00:05:55.100
So the question is, which is
more likely to happen?

00:05:55.100 --> 00:05:55.940
Do both happen?

00:05:55.940 --> 00:05:59.200
Does one happen
disproportionately?

00:05:59.200 --> 00:06:02.180
And the answer is, is that,
yes, one happens

00:06:02.180 --> 00:06:03.080
disproportionately.

00:06:03.080 --> 00:06:06.320
This one, this is the
dominant product.

00:06:06.320 --> 00:06:09.660
If you were to perform this
reaction and you were to

00:06:09.660 --> 00:06:12.080
analyze in your beaker or
wherever you're performing the

00:06:12.080 --> 00:06:15.780
reaction what you see most of,
the majority product, the

00:06:15.780 --> 00:06:16.810
great majority, is
going to be the

00:06:16.810 --> 00:06:20.130
but-2-ene, not the but-1-ene.

00:06:20.130 --> 00:06:22.680
Maybe you see very, very
little of this.

00:06:22.680 --> 00:06:24.030
And the question is why?

00:06:24.030 --> 00:06:25.920
Or how would you even be
able to determine that?

00:06:25.920 --> 00:06:27.710
Or how could you have
predicted that?

00:06:27.710 --> 00:06:29.350
And to predict it,
there's something

00:06:29.350 --> 00:06:31.710
called Zaitsev's rule.

00:06:31.710 --> 00:06:34.490
And I'm sure I mispronouncing
it, but let me write it down.

00:06:34.490 --> 00:06:40.080
So Zaitsev's rule.

00:06:40.080 --> 00:06:43.010
And it's kind of analogous to
Markovnikov's rule, but for

00:06:43.010 --> 00:06:44.080
elimination reactions.

00:06:44.080 --> 00:06:45.980
If you think about it, the
addition reactions that we did

00:06:45.980 --> 00:06:48.260
many videos ago are
the opposite of

00:06:48.260 --> 00:06:49.340
the elimination reactions.

00:06:49.340 --> 00:06:51.210
In the addition reactions, we're
adding the chloro group,

00:06:51.210 --> 00:06:52.830
and in the elimination,
we're taking it off.

00:06:52.830 --> 00:06:55.840
And so Zaitsev's rule is
kind of analogous to

00:06:55.840 --> 00:06:56.920
Markovnikov's rule.

00:06:56.920 --> 00:06:58.500
Now first, I'll just tell you
the rule, then we can think a

00:06:58.500 --> 00:07:01.020
little bit about why it works.

00:07:01.020 --> 00:07:03.910
The jury's not out on this.

00:07:03.910 --> 00:07:05.350
They think they know
why it works, but

00:07:05.350 --> 00:07:06.760
they're not 100% sure.

00:07:06.760 --> 00:07:10.100
So Zaitsev's rules says the
carbon that is going to lose

00:07:10.100 --> 00:07:14.020
the hydrogen is the one that
has fewer hydrogens.

00:07:14.020 --> 00:07:18.600
So let me write it
down over here.

00:07:18.600 --> 00:07:28.250
Carbon more likely to lose
hydrogen is-- I should say the

00:07:28.250 --> 00:07:32.080
hydrogen proton because it keeps
the electron still-- is

00:07:32.080 --> 00:07:37.240
the one with fewer hydrogens.

00:07:39.940 --> 00:07:42.650
So if you were to look at this
reaction right here, we have

00:07:42.650 --> 00:07:44.080
our alpha carbon.

00:07:44.080 --> 00:07:47.300
Either this beta carbon or this
beta carbon could lose

00:07:47.300 --> 00:07:48.030
its hydrogen.

00:07:48.030 --> 00:07:50.050
This one has three
hydrogens on it.

00:07:50.050 --> 00:07:51.140
This one only has two.

00:07:51.140 --> 00:07:56.930
So Zaitsev's rule tells us that
this is the hydrogen, or

00:07:56.930 --> 00:07:59.310
actually the proton, that
is more likely to be

00:07:59.310 --> 00:08:00.760
reacted with the base.

00:08:00.760 --> 00:08:04.430
You could almost view it as it
is the more acidic proton.

00:08:04.430 --> 00:08:06.420
It is a lower-hanging
fruit for this

00:08:06.420 --> 00:08:08.950
strong base to capture.

00:08:08.950 --> 00:08:11.240
Now, a more interesting
question-- and that's a pretty

00:08:11.240 --> 00:08:12.130
easy rule to follow.

00:08:12.130 --> 00:08:14.280
And if they both have the same
number, then you'd see equal

00:08:14.280 --> 00:08:17.450
products depending on
which side it gets.

00:08:17.450 --> 00:08:22.510
Now the question is why
is this happening?

00:08:22.510 --> 00:08:24.040
And here, something called

00:08:24.040 --> 00:08:27.820
hyperconjugation comes into effect.

00:08:27.820 --> 00:08:29.410
I'm not going to go into details
in it and to the

00:08:29.410 --> 00:08:30.660
quantum mechanics of it.

00:08:35.289 --> 00:08:41.940
And hyperconjugation is the
notion that the fact-- so we

00:08:41.940 --> 00:08:44.550
said that the one with the fewer
hydrogens is the one

00:08:44.550 --> 00:08:46.160
that's less likely to lose.

00:08:46.160 --> 00:08:48.810
Or the one with fewer hydrogens
is the one more

00:08:48.810 --> 00:08:50.990
likely to lose the
hydrogen proton.

00:08:50.990 --> 00:08:53.830
But the one with fewer hydrogens
is also bonded to

00:08:53.830 --> 00:08:55.120
more carbons.

00:08:55.120 --> 00:08:57.900
This guy's bonded to
one carbon outside

00:08:57.900 --> 00:08:58.690
of the alpha carbon.

00:08:58.690 --> 00:09:01.360
He's actually bonded to two:
the alpha and this carbon.

00:09:01.360 --> 00:09:03.920
This guy right here is only
bonded to the alpha carbon.

00:09:03.920 --> 00:09:09.340
And hyperconjugation is the
notion that not the beta

00:09:09.340 --> 00:09:13.160
carbon, but the carbons one over
from that help stabilize

00:09:13.160 --> 00:09:15.220
the double bond that eventually
forms. I almost

00:09:15.220 --> 00:09:19.550
think of it you have more
electrons over here because

00:09:19.550 --> 00:09:23.760
carbons have more electrons
to offer than hydrogens.

00:09:23.760 --> 00:09:26.970
At the end of the day, this
guy is more likely able to

00:09:26.970 --> 00:09:30.120
donate electrons to form from
the right-hand side to make a

00:09:30.120 --> 00:09:32.360
double bond than from
the left-hand side.

00:09:32.360 --> 00:09:34.990
I won't go into the detail of
hyperconjugation, but it's all

00:09:34.990 --> 00:09:38.390
based on the notion that the
more stable double bond will

00:09:38.390 --> 00:09:42.730
be formed if we have other
carbons near the double bond.

00:09:42.730 --> 00:09:43.860
Now, another way to
think about is

00:09:43.860 --> 00:09:45.420
to look at the products.

00:09:45.420 --> 00:09:49.460
So we saw or Zaitsev's rule
tells us that but-2-ene is a

00:09:49.460 --> 00:09:52.130
more likely product
than but-1-ene.

00:09:52.130 --> 00:09:58.640
And if you look at but-1-ene, we
could rewrite it like this.

00:09:58.640 --> 00:10:00.960
We could draw the double
bond like this.

00:10:00.960 --> 00:10:06.590
This carbon is what was
the alpha carbon.

00:10:06.590 --> 00:10:08.360
We could draw a carbon
right here.

00:10:08.360 --> 00:10:10.740
And then it is bonded
to a hydrogen.

00:10:10.740 --> 00:10:12.390
It's bonded to this hydrogen.

00:10:12.390 --> 00:10:17.830
And then it's bonded to just
a chain of carbons.

00:10:17.830 --> 00:10:19.310
We'll just write R on that.

00:10:19.310 --> 00:10:21.100
And then this guy is just
bonded to two hydrogens.

00:10:26.350 --> 00:10:27.790
Well, this isn't necessarily
but-1-ene.

00:10:27.790 --> 00:10:29.250
I just put an R here, but
this is how it could be

00:10:29.250 --> 00:10:29.770
represented.

00:10:29.770 --> 00:10:33.760
Now, the but-2-ene, if we wanted
to draw it like this

00:10:33.760 --> 00:10:36.870
would look like this.

00:10:36.870 --> 00:10:42.556
We could call this right
here R prime.

00:10:42.556 --> 00:10:44.390
It's just a chain of carbons.

00:10:44.390 --> 00:10:52.150
And then we could call
this R prime prime.

00:10:52.150 --> 00:10:53.150
It's not even a chain.

00:10:53.150 --> 00:10:54.040
It's just one carbon.

00:10:54.040 --> 00:10:57.320
But if we call it that, then the
but-2-ene-- let me draw it

00:10:57.320 --> 00:10:59.270
down here where I have
more real estate.

00:10:59.270 --> 00:11:00.830
The but-2-ene would
look like this.

00:11:00.830 --> 00:11:02.490
You have your carbon-carbon
double bond.

00:11:05.120 --> 00:11:08.070
Now, the left-hand carbon is
bonded to a hydrogen, that

00:11:08.070 --> 00:11:12.930
hydrogen right there,
and to R prime.

00:11:12.930 --> 00:11:16.090
And the right-hand carbon
is bonded to

00:11:16.090 --> 00:11:19.100
hydrogen and R prime prime.

00:11:19.100 --> 00:11:25.470
So it's bonded to a hydrogen
and R prime prime.

00:11:25.470 --> 00:11:27.830
All I did here-- let me see if
I can fit it all on the same

00:11:27.830 --> 00:11:31.890
screen-- is I just redrew this
and I just abstracted away the

00:11:31.890 --> 00:11:34.600
chain as it goes away from
the double bond.

00:11:34.600 --> 00:11:36.500
And I did that so that we
can look at it this way.

00:11:36.500 --> 00:11:39.200
We can just have the double bond
kind of as our focus of

00:11:39.200 --> 00:11:42.230
attention and think about what's
going on around it.

00:11:42.230 --> 00:11:45.750
Over here, for the but-1-ene,
and we already said this is

00:11:45.750 --> 00:11:49.260
the lesser product, so this
is the greater product.

00:11:49.260 --> 00:11:51.780
This is the greater, or
the dominant product.

00:11:51.780 --> 00:11:56.180
In the lesser product, if we go
off of the double bond, we

00:11:56.180 --> 00:12:01.330
only have one alkyl
group right there.

00:12:01.330 --> 00:12:02.370
That R right here.

00:12:02.370 --> 00:12:04.080
Over here, we have two.

00:12:04.080 --> 00:12:07.390
And we say that this is
more substituted.

00:12:07.390 --> 00:12:09.500
And when w say substituted,
you're imagining that you're

00:12:09.500 --> 00:12:11.620
substituting hydrogens
with carbon

00:12:11.620 --> 00:12:13.500
chains, with alkyl groups.

00:12:13.500 --> 00:12:17.530
So this one right here
is more substituted.

00:12:20.230 --> 00:12:24.760
And hyperconjugation, so the
idea would have it, is that

00:12:24.760 --> 00:12:28.880
these carbon chains that are
near the double bond help

00:12:28.880 --> 00:12:30.970
stabilize it.

00:12:30.970 --> 00:12:35.280
Some of their sigma electrons
and sigma orbitals are there

00:12:35.280 --> 00:12:38.800
to somehow help stabilize
the pi orbitals.

00:12:38.800 --> 00:12:40.670
And now this is getting into
quantum mechanics and all of

00:12:40.670 --> 00:12:44.770
that, so it's a little bit-- you
know, the world isn't 100%

00:12:44.770 --> 00:12:46.710
clear whether that's definitely
the mechanism,

00:12:46.710 --> 00:12:48.930
although people have run the
experiment, and they know that

00:12:48.930 --> 00:12:53.910
the more substituted product
is what you're going to see

00:12:53.910 --> 00:12:57.000
more of as opposed to the less
substituted, and that all

00:12:57.000 --> 00:12:58.450
comes from Zaitsev's rule.

00:12:58.450 --> 00:13:00.530
So, hopefully, you at least
get Zaitsev's rule.

00:13:00.530 --> 00:13:02.900
The hyperconjugation, that's
kind of a deeper concept.

00:13:02.900 --> 00:13:04.880
You know, the jury's
not even out on it.

00:13:04.880 --> 00:13:07.380
That's a belief of why
Zaitsev's rule works.

00:13:07.380 --> 00:13:09.470
But the rule itself is pretty
straightforward.

00:13:09.470 --> 00:13:12.030
If you're trying to pick between
two beta carbons, the

00:13:12.030 --> 00:13:14.280
one that's going to lose the
hydrogen is the one that

00:13:14.280 --> 00:13:17.040
already has pure hydrogens
or the one that's

00:13:17.040 --> 00:13:19.190
bonded to more carbons.

00:13:19.190 --> 00:13:20.120
And this is true.

00:13:20.120 --> 00:13:21.010
I drew it.

00:13:21.010 --> 00:13:24.400
Everything we focused on right
now was in an E2 reaction.

00:13:24.400 --> 00:13:28.160
But it's just as true
in an E1 reaction.
