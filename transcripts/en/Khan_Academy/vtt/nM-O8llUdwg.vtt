00:00:00.710 --> 00:00:04.590
Construct a line perpendicular
to the given line.

00:00:04.590 --> 00:00:08.210
So if I can pick two
arbitrary points on this line,

00:00:08.210 --> 00:00:10.650
and if I can make a
line that is always

00:00:10.650 --> 00:00:13.010
equidistant from
those two points,

00:00:13.010 --> 00:00:14.629
then that line will
be perpendicular.

00:00:14.629 --> 00:00:16.670
And actually, it will be
a perpendicular bisector

00:00:16.670 --> 00:00:19.140
of the segment formed
by those two points.

00:00:19.140 --> 00:00:21.404
Now, they don't care whether
we're bisecting anything.

00:00:21.404 --> 00:00:23.320
But they do care about
it being perpendicular.

00:00:23.320 --> 00:00:24.250
So let's do this.

00:00:24.250 --> 00:00:27.340
So I'm going to draw a
circle with my compass.

00:00:27.340 --> 00:00:30.690
And so let's just pick that
point right over there.

00:00:30.690 --> 00:00:32.890
I could adjust the
radius if I like.

00:00:32.890 --> 00:00:35.920
But I might as well-- well, I'll
just leave it right over there.

00:00:35.920 --> 00:00:37.230
Now let me draw another circle.

00:00:37.230 --> 00:00:38.646
And this time, I'm
going to center

00:00:38.646 --> 00:00:43.530
it where the first circle
intersects with my line.

00:00:43.530 --> 00:00:46.180
And then I'm going to
adjust the radius to overlap

00:00:46.180 --> 00:00:49.480
with the first dot.

00:00:49.480 --> 00:00:52.550
And now, where these
two circles intersect,

00:00:52.550 --> 00:00:56.320
those are points that
are equidistant from both

00:00:56.320 --> 00:00:59.500
of these centers that
I just constructed.

00:00:59.500 --> 00:01:02.620
So let me draw a line
that connects those two.

00:01:02.620 --> 00:01:06.940
And that line is going
to be perpendicular

00:01:06.940 --> 00:01:10.000
to our original line.
