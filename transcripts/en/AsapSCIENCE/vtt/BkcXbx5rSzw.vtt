00:00:00.360 --> 00:00:03.290
While many search for the proverbial
fountain of youth, you might be wondering

00:00:03.290 --> 00:00:07.269
why do we age in the first place?
What is it about our bodies or cells

00:00:07.269 --> 00:00:11.410
biologically that causes us to grow old?
There is a variety of internal and

00:00:11.410 --> 00:00:15.200
external factors such as diet, exercise
or environmental stress which all

00:00:15.200 --> 00:00:18.920
contribute to cell damage and repair and
effect the rate of aging,  But the

00:00:18.920 --> 00:00:22.490
surprising truth is that apart from these, we actually have a biological

00:00:22.490 --> 00:00:27.570
clock buried within our genetic makeup.
And this clock can only run for so long,

00:00:27.570 --> 00:00:31.670
in other words we are programmed to die. Your body is made up of trillions of cells

00:00:31.670 --> 00:00:35.280
which are constantly going through cell
division and every time they divide they

00:00:35.280 --> 00:00:39.630
make a copy of their DNA as well.  This
DNA is tightly packed into structures

00:00:39.630 --> 00:00:40.910
called chromosomes

00:00:40.910 --> 00:00:45.500
of which humans have twenty three pairs.  The problem is, DNA replication isn't

00:00:45.500 --> 00:00:48.579
quite perfect and skips over the end of
each chromosome.

00:00:48.579 --> 00:00:51.879
To protect against important DNA
information being cut out we have

00:00:51.879 --> 00:00:55.339
something called telomeres on the
end of chromosomes which are essentially

00:00:55.339 --> 00:00:59.449
meaningless repeats of DNA that we can afford to lose.  But everytime

00:00:59.449 --> 00:01:03.760
our cells divide these telomeres become
shorter and shorter until eventually

00:01:03.760 --> 00:01:08.179
they've been entirely stripped away.  At
which point the cell no longer divides.

00:01:08.179 --> 00:01:12.090
Some flat worms are able to endlessly
regenerate their telomeres making them

00:01:12.090 --> 00:01:16.580
effectively biologically immortal, but
their lifespans do vary and they're

00:01:16.580 --> 00:01:20.509
still susceptible to disease further
suggesting that aging is a mix of

00:01:20.509 --> 00:01:22.570
genetic and environmental factors.

00:01:22.570 --> 00:01:26.500
But why don't our cells do this?
Ultimately this replication limit

00:01:26.500 --> 00:01:30.680
actually helps to prevent cancer which
is the uncontrollable growth of cells

00:01:30.680 --> 00:01:34.360
and evasion of cell death.  The point at
which a cell stops replicating is

00:01:34.360 --> 00:01:36.229
known as cellular senescence.

00:01:36.229 --> 00:01:40.570
In humans this replication limit is around
fifty times.  Once it is reached the cell

00:01:40.570 --> 00:01:43.810
gradually begins to lose its function
and die causing age-related

00:01:43.810 --> 00:01:47.930
characteristics.  This also helps to
explain why life expectancy is a

00:01:47.930 --> 00:01:51.390
strongly heritable trait from your
parents, because you got your initial

00:01:51.390 --> 00:01:53.650
telomere length from them.
