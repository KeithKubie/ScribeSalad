00:00:00.670 --> 00:00:02.340
So we have the same
setup here as we

00:00:02.340 --> 00:00:05.450
had in the previous problem,
in problem number 42,

00:00:05.450 --> 00:00:07.710
where p is an odd prime number.

00:00:07.710 --> 00:00:11.020
And they say, "Let T sub p
be the following set of 2

00:00:11.020 --> 00:00:13.090
by 2 matrices," where
each of those matrices

00:00:13.090 --> 00:00:16.230
have the form a's along the
diagonals and then a b there

00:00:16.230 --> 00:00:17.140
and a c there.

00:00:17.140 --> 00:00:19.470
And each of those
numbers are between 0

00:00:19.470 --> 00:00:21.260
and p minus 1 inclusive.

00:00:21.260 --> 00:00:25.000
So they can be 0, 1, 2, 3,
all the way up to p minus 1.

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:26.850
And then in number
43, they ask us,

00:00:26.850 --> 00:00:31.940
"The number of A in the set
such that the trace of A

00:00:31.940 --> 00:00:35.410
is not divisible by p,
but the determinant of A

00:00:35.410 --> 00:00:41.414
is divisible by p is?"

00:00:41.414 --> 00:00:43.330
And then, they tell us,
"The trace of a matrix

00:00:43.330 --> 00:00:45.299
is the sum of its
diagonal entries."

00:00:45.299 --> 00:00:47.090
It's actually the sum
of its main diagonal.

00:00:47.090 --> 00:00:48.130
It's not going to
be that diagonal.

00:00:48.130 --> 00:00:49.350
It's only the sum of this.

00:00:49.350 --> 00:00:53.310
So if you sum this, you're going
to get the trace of the matrix.

00:00:53.310 --> 00:00:56.120
So let's use this first
piece of information.

00:00:56.120 --> 00:00:59.940
The trace of A is
not divisible by p.

00:00:59.940 --> 00:01:03.760
So the trace of A is going
to be a plus a, or 2a.

00:01:03.760 --> 00:01:14.180
So 2a not divisible by p.

00:01:14.180 --> 00:01:17.860
So let's think of a situation
where 2a is divisible by p.

00:01:17.860 --> 00:01:22.540
So 2a could be equal
to 0, because 0

00:01:22.540 --> 00:01:27.140
is a multiple of p, in which
case a would be equal to 0.

00:01:27.140 --> 00:01:28.790
So this is a possibility.

00:01:28.790 --> 00:01:33.810
So if a is equal to 0,
then 2a is divisible by p.

00:01:33.810 --> 00:01:36.250
So one of the constraints,
from this sentence right here,

00:01:36.250 --> 00:01:38.070
is that a cannot be equal to 0.

00:01:38.070 --> 00:01:40.790
Because if a is 0, then the
trace is divisible by p.

00:01:40.790 --> 00:01:42.389
So a cannot be equal to 0.

00:01:42.389 --> 00:01:43.430
And let's think about it.

00:01:43.430 --> 00:01:45.730
Can 2a become any
other multiple of p?

00:01:45.730 --> 00:01:49.190
Can 2a equal p?

00:01:49.190 --> 00:01:52.760
Well, if 2a equaled p, then 2
and a would be factors of p,

00:01:52.760 --> 00:01:54.950
and then p would not be prime.

00:01:54.950 --> 00:01:56.810
And so we can cross that out.

00:01:56.810 --> 00:01:59.730
And then 2a can't
be equal to 2p.

00:01:59.730 --> 00:02:02.380
That would make a equal
to p, which is impossible,

00:02:02.380 --> 00:02:04.070
because a can only be p minus 1.

00:02:04.070 --> 00:02:05.990
So that's not possible.

00:02:05.990 --> 00:02:08.624
And then you can keep going
higher, higher multiples of p,

00:02:08.624 --> 00:02:12.610
not possible, because a is
going to be smaller than p.

00:02:12.610 --> 00:02:15.220
So the only constraint that we
get from this first sentence,

00:02:15.220 --> 00:02:16.920
the trace of a is
not divisible by p,

00:02:16.920 --> 00:02:19.780
tells us that a
does not equal 0.

00:02:19.780 --> 00:02:21.600
So now let's look at
the second constraint.

00:02:21.600 --> 00:02:27.340
The determinant of
A is divisible by p.

00:02:27.340 --> 00:02:29.640
So the determinant of
A-- let me write this.

00:02:29.640 --> 00:02:33.770
The determinant of A
is equal to a times

00:02:33.770 --> 00:02:37.990
a-- it's equal to a squared
minus b times c, or c times

00:02:37.990 --> 00:02:39.280
b, so minus bc.

00:02:39.280 --> 00:02:44.850
So this is going to
be divisible by p.

00:02:44.850 --> 00:02:49.900
This is going to be equal
to some integer times p.

00:02:49.900 --> 00:02:52.010
Now one thing just
looking at this,

00:02:52.010 --> 00:02:53.922
there's no obvious
simplification here.

00:02:53.922 --> 00:02:55.630
But one thing I'm
starting to appreciate,

00:02:55.630 --> 00:02:57.950
not having taken the
IIT Joint Entrance

00:02:57.950 --> 00:03:00.760
Exam when I was in high school,
not growing up in India,

00:03:00.760 --> 00:03:03.350
is that when they have
multiple choices, sometimes

00:03:03.350 --> 00:03:05.747
it might be faster to just
do the brute force method.

00:03:05.747 --> 00:03:07.330
And when I say the
brute force method,

00:03:07.330 --> 00:03:10.000
not just proving mathematically
which of these expressions

00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:13.190
are true, but just
let's try a simple p.

00:03:13.190 --> 00:03:15.760
Let's try a simple
p, and then let's

00:03:15.760 --> 00:03:20.850
find the members of the set
that would satisfy it for that p

00:03:20.850 --> 00:03:23.450
and then see which of these
expressions equal that p.

00:03:23.450 --> 00:03:24.660
Let's see what we get.

00:03:24.660 --> 00:03:26.010
So let's just simplify this.

00:03:26.010 --> 00:03:28.160
Let's just say p is equal to 3.

00:03:28.160 --> 00:03:31.710
And I pick p is equal to 3
because that's the smallest odd

00:03:31.710 --> 00:03:32.330
prime number.

00:03:32.330 --> 00:03:35.220
It's the smallest number that
satisfies this constraint

00:03:35.220 --> 00:03:36.130
up here.

00:03:36.130 --> 00:03:38.120
So let's set p is equal to 3.

00:03:38.120 --> 00:03:43.480
So if p is equal to 3,
our possibilities for a

00:03:43.480 --> 00:03:46.090
are that a could be equal
to-- a can't be equal to 0.

00:03:46.090 --> 00:03:47.350
We know that already.

00:03:47.350 --> 00:03:48.440
a cannot be equal to 0.

00:03:48.440 --> 00:03:55.730
So a could be equal to 1
or a could be equal to 2.

00:03:55.730 --> 00:04:00.500
And if a is equal to 1,
then the determinant of A

00:04:00.500 --> 00:04:05.890
is going to be equal
to 1 minus bc, which

00:04:05.890 --> 00:04:12.000
needs to be equal to some
integer multiple of 3,

00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:14.100
because we set our
p is equal to 3.

00:04:14.100 --> 00:04:16.670
It must be equal to 3k.

00:04:16.670 --> 00:04:18.709
If a is equal to 2,
then the determinant

00:04:18.709 --> 00:04:21.970
is going to be 4,
because it's a squared.

00:04:21.970 --> 00:04:24.690
So it's going to
be 4 minus bc, must

00:04:24.690 --> 00:04:28.270
be equal to some
integer multiple of 3.

00:04:28.270 --> 00:04:30.390
So let's see how many
combinations of b and c

00:04:30.390 --> 00:04:33.250
we can find in each
of these constraints.

00:04:33.250 --> 00:04:35.240
So 1 minus bc.

00:04:35.240 --> 00:04:38.430
So one possibility--
let's think about it.

00:04:38.430 --> 00:04:43.040
So one possibility is 1 minus
bc is equal to 3 times 0.

00:04:43.040 --> 00:04:44.420
That's one possibility.

00:04:44.420 --> 00:04:51.894
Maybe another possibility
is 1 minus bc is equal to 3.

00:04:51.894 --> 00:04:53.810
Actually, let's think
about this a little bit.

00:04:53.810 --> 00:04:56.630
Let me try this
possibility here, first.

00:04:56.630 --> 00:04:58.370
So if 1 minus bc is
equal to 0-- this

00:04:58.370 --> 00:05:01.500
is pretty straightforward-- bc
would have to be equal to 1.

00:05:01.500 --> 00:05:04.950
And so b would have
to be equal to 1

00:05:04.950 --> 00:05:06.820
and c would have
to be equal to 1.

00:05:06.820 --> 00:05:12.130
So we have one combination
here, a could be equal to 1,

00:05:12.130 --> 00:05:14.940
b is equal to 1,
and c is equal to 1.

00:05:14.940 --> 00:05:18.490
That is one possibility
right over there.

00:05:18.490 --> 00:05:20.910
And then another
possibility-- now,

00:05:20.910 --> 00:05:26.000
no matter what bc we pick
here, the maximum value

00:05:26.000 --> 00:05:27.210
here is going to be 1.

00:05:27.210 --> 00:05:30.350
If bc are both 0, then this
expression is going to be 1.

00:05:30.350 --> 00:05:32.910
If they're both 1, this
expression is going to be 0.

00:05:32.910 --> 00:05:35.520
If they are any other value--
and the only other values

00:05:35.520 --> 00:05:37.750
that they could be are
some combination of 1 and 2

00:05:37.750 --> 00:05:41.220
or 2 and 2-- then we're going
to get a negative number.

00:05:41.220 --> 00:05:44.720
So the question is, is
a negative multiple of 3

00:05:44.720 --> 00:05:47.280
considered to be
a multiple of 3?

00:05:47.280 --> 00:05:49.770
Now let's just figure it
out assuming that it is,

00:05:49.770 --> 00:05:52.150
and then we can see if maybe
one of these expressions

00:05:52.150 --> 00:05:52.650
makes sense.

00:05:52.650 --> 00:05:55.420
And I'm going to do that in
white just because it depends.

00:05:55.420 --> 00:05:57.790
If you considered
negative 3 divisible by 3,

00:05:57.790 --> 00:05:59.020
then we should go with that.

00:05:59.020 --> 00:06:01.600
So maybe we should
say 1 minus bc

00:06:01.600 --> 00:06:05.580
could be equal to
negative 3, which

00:06:05.580 --> 00:06:07.760
is the same thing
as bc minus 1 is

00:06:07.760 --> 00:06:10.530
equal to 3, which is the
same-- I just multiplied

00:06:10.530 --> 00:06:13.710
both sides by negative 1--
which is the same thing as bc

00:06:13.710 --> 00:06:15.979
is equal to 4.

00:06:15.979 --> 00:06:17.270
And we have to be careful here.

00:06:17.270 --> 00:06:20.310
You might be tempted to say b
is equal to 1, c is equal to 4,

00:06:20.310 --> 00:06:21.810
or b is equal to
4, c is equal to 1,

00:06:21.810 --> 00:06:23.590
but they can't be equal to 4.

00:06:23.590 --> 00:06:24.980
4 is bigger than our p.

00:06:24.980 --> 00:06:26.440
They can only be up to 2.

00:06:26.440 --> 00:06:29.860
So this constraint is
only, b is equal to 2,

00:06:29.860 --> 00:06:31.700
and c is equal to 2.

00:06:31.700 --> 00:06:33.880
And of course, a is equal to 1.

00:06:33.880 --> 00:06:37.190
So this is, if you do
consider negative 3

00:06:37.190 --> 00:06:40.380
to be divisible by 3,
which it actually is.

00:06:40.380 --> 00:06:41.600
It's negative 1 times 3.

00:06:41.600 --> 00:06:42.690
It is a multiple.

00:06:42.690 --> 00:06:44.679
So this would be
one of the cases.

00:06:44.679 --> 00:06:46.220
But I'll put that
there just in case.

00:06:46.220 --> 00:06:48.678
You never know what the test
writers are actually thinking.

00:06:48.678 --> 00:06:50.900
So I'll put that there as
kind of a contingent case.

00:06:50.900 --> 00:06:54.750
And then this last situation,
4 minus bc is equal to 3k.

00:06:54.750 --> 00:07:01.810
So 4 minus bc could
be equal to 0.

00:07:01.810 --> 00:07:04.200
Or 4 minus bc--
let's think about it.

00:07:04.200 --> 00:07:06.710
4 minus bc could be equal to 0.

00:07:06.710 --> 00:07:10.300
4 minus bc could be equal to 3.

00:07:10.300 --> 00:07:13.280
That's definitely a possibility,
because this value right here

00:07:13.280 --> 00:07:15.640
will always be less than 4.

00:07:15.640 --> 00:07:18.030
And you can't get
anything less than 0

00:07:18.030 --> 00:07:21.020
here, because the highest
value for b and c are both 2.

00:07:21.020 --> 00:07:23.820
2 times 2 is going to be 4,
so you can't get anything less

00:07:23.820 --> 00:07:24.610
than 0 here.

00:07:24.610 --> 00:07:26.350
So you won't have
a case like this.

00:07:26.350 --> 00:07:27.610
So-- and I just said it.

00:07:27.610 --> 00:07:30.980
So if you have this equation,
that means 4 is equal to bc.

00:07:30.980 --> 00:07:34.440
The only possibility with
b and c being less than 3,

00:07:34.440 --> 00:07:38.350
being 0, 1, or 2, is
that b is equal to 2,

00:07:38.350 --> 00:07:39.512
and c is equal to 2.

00:07:39.512 --> 00:07:41.220
Neither one of those
could be equal to 4,

00:07:41.220 --> 00:07:42.990
because that's
bigger than our p.

00:07:42.990 --> 00:07:48.810
And so here, we have a is
equal to 2, b is equal to 2,

00:07:48.810 --> 00:07:50.750
and c is equal to 2.

00:07:50.750 --> 00:07:53.190
And then if 4 minus
bc is equal to 3,

00:07:53.190 --> 00:07:57.340
that means that this, that
bc, has to be equal to 1,

00:07:57.340 --> 00:07:58.550
bc is equal to 1.

00:07:58.550 --> 00:08:00.810
And so the only
possibility is that-- let

00:08:00.810 --> 00:08:03.600
me scroll to the
right-- b is equal to 1,

00:08:03.600 --> 00:08:07.770
and c is equal to 1, and
of course, a is equal to 2.

00:08:10.920 --> 00:08:14.060
So we've been able to list four
distinct possibilities, four

00:08:14.060 --> 00:08:17.450
distinct matrices, for
our p is equal to 3.

00:08:17.450 --> 00:08:21.470
Now let's see if any
of these evaluate to 4

00:08:21.470 --> 00:08:23.560
when p is equal to 3.

00:08:23.560 --> 00:08:24.840
Let me put this down here.

00:08:24.840 --> 00:08:29.600
So if we have 3 minus 2--
sorry, 3 minus 1, that's 2,

00:08:29.600 --> 00:08:32.490
3 squared, 9, minus
3 is 6, plus 1 is 7.

00:08:32.490 --> 00:08:33.460
So this is 2 times 7.

00:08:33.460 --> 00:08:34.330
That's 14.

00:08:34.330 --> 00:08:37.500
That doesn't evaluate to 4.

00:08:37.500 --> 00:08:45.120
This is 27 minus 4, this is
23, also doesn't evaluate to 4.

00:08:45.120 --> 00:08:47.170
3 minus 1 squared,
that's 2 squared.

00:08:47.170 --> 00:08:48.550
This evaluates to 4.

00:08:48.550 --> 00:08:49.842
So this is looking pretty good.

00:08:49.842 --> 00:08:51.841
We just have to hope that
something else doesn't

00:08:51.841 --> 00:08:52.660
evaluate to 4.

00:08:52.660 --> 00:08:57.610
This is 2, 3 minus
1 is 2, times 7.

00:08:57.610 --> 00:08:59.650
Once again, this is also 14.

00:08:59.650 --> 00:09:00.730
Not there.

00:09:00.730 --> 00:09:01.860
So I would go with C.

00:09:01.860 --> 00:09:05.440
And so the exam writers
really did want negative 3

00:09:05.440 --> 00:09:09.190
to be a possible-- or they
really do view negative 3

00:09:09.190 --> 00:09:11.009
as being divisible
by 3, which it is.

00:09:11.009 --> 00:09:12.550
But, you know,
sometimes people think

00:09:12.550 --> 00:09:15.040
of it only as kind of
positive multiples.

00:09:15.040 --> 00:09:18.403
But it clearly is divisible
by 3, so our answer is C.
