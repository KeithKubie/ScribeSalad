00:00:00.150 --> 00:00:04.110
Just to recap and tie in some of the things we've covered earlier in

00:00:04.110 --> 00:00:09.180
this lesson, I would say that this is very much an author driven narrative.

00:00:09.180 --> 00:00:14.370
Partly because it's static, but more importantly, I as in author decided to

00:00:14.370 --> 00:00:19.270
make the red circles slightly larger and to represent the home team.

00:00:19.270 --> 00:00:23.940
So I dictated what information I wanted to draw attention to,

00:00:23.940 --> 00:00:27.260
which other information may not be as striking.

00:00:27.260 --> 00:00:30.630
And even by the simple fact of making the home team red,

00:00:30.630 --> 00:00:34.200
and every other team matches blue, as an author,

00:00:34.200 --> 00:00:38.980
I've influenced how a reader might interpret the graphic I've presented them.

00:00:38.980 --> 00:00:41.880
And in closing, I just wanted to come back to where we

00:00:41.880 --> 00:00:44.220
started before were even live coding.

00:00:44.220 --> 00:00:47.360
We're trying to communicate our insight and our message.

00:00:47.360 --> 00:00:51.290
In the case of this chart relating to the globalization of the world, and

00:00:51.290 --> 00:00:55.680
also capitalization of the gains in an effective manner.

00:00:55.680 --> 00:00:57.800
And again, just to remind you,

00:00:57.800 --> 00:01:03.810
always be aware of biases in your data, yourself, and your audience.

00:01:03.810 --> 00:01:07.400
And always consider how your audience might interpret or

00:01:07.400 --> 00:01:09.710
interact with your visualization.

00:01:09.710 --> 00:01:12.930
And I'll leave you with one last open-ended question.

00:01:12.930 --> 00:01:17.140
Have we achieved what we set out to by communicating our message?

00:01:17.140 --> 00:01:21.880
I encourage you to think about and post your thoughts in the forum about,

00:01:21.880 --> 00:01:25.660
what works about this visualization, what could be improved, and

00:01:25.660 --> 00:01:31.200
also whether the next step is an iteration on the scatter plot like this or

00:01:31.200 --> 00:01:33.420
something more drastic where we change.

00:01:33.420 --> 00:01:34.670
The complete form and

00:01:34.670 --> 00:01:38.919
structure as we take one step closer to best communicating our message.
