00:00:04.040 --> 00:00:08.240
It's easy to grow up with a sense that our feelings are reliable guides

00:00:08.240 --> 00:00:11.760
to ourselves, the people around us, and the world at large.

00:00:12.340 --> 00:00:17.060
We can call this optimistic thesis the 'clear pane' theory of the mind,

00:00:17.260 --> 00:00:20.140
iImplying that we are able to look out onto the world

00:00:20.180 --> 00:00:25.780
pretty much as if through an undistorted, and blemish-free pane of glass.

00:00:26.540 --> 00:00:31.820
Yet a long tradition in philosophy has sought to warn us of a far trickier truth.

00:00:31.820 --> 00:00:37.300
The school of thought, known as skepticism, that began in Ancient Greece in the third century B.C.

00:00:37.400 --> 00:00:42.100
proposed that a great many of our solid-seeming sensory first impressions

00:00:42.100 --> 00:00:44.500
should not be assumed to be accurate

00:00:44.500 --> 00:00:49.920
and must instead be submitted to the laborious process of rational unscrambling.

00:00:50.540 --> 00:00:55.300
Far from our minds being clear panes, they're full of scratches, blind spots and warps.

00:00:56.280 --> 00:01:00.880
To be wise, therefore, means for the skeptics to strive to be permanently vigilant

00:01:00.880 --> 00:01:04.440
no matter how much we're inclined to misunderstand reality

00:01:04.440 --> 00:01:06.740
by trusting our first feelings.

00:01:07.500 --> 00:01:12.260
One tiny instance of our distorting minds that particularly fascinated the Greeks

00:01:12.260 --> 00:01:17.040
was a strange phenomenon that occurs when a stick is partially submerged in water.

00:01:17.320 --> 00:01:23.040
It immediately seems as if the stick angles into a "V" just at the point where it meets the surface.

00:01:23.400 --> 00:01:26.800
But, if we pull the stick out, we'll see that it's of course, still straight.

00:01:27.300 --> 00:01:31.160
The skeptics took this tiny example as a gateway to a vast truth:

00:01:31.560 --> 00:01:34.140
that our senses are humbling fallible.

00:01:34.620 --> 00:01:39.760
The way things appear to us is often simply not how they, in fact, really are.

00:01:40.360 --> 00:01:45.160
Skeptical ideas were to be the leading force behind the development of modern science.

00:01:45.160 --> 00:01:49.620
In the middle of the 16th century, the Polish philosopher and astronomer Capernicus

00:01:49.640 --> 00:01:54.440
demonstrated that whatever our senses might have suggested to us for hundreds of thousands of years,

00:01:54.440 --> 00:02:00.400
according to logical reasoning, the truth is that the sun does not, in fact, revolve around the earth.

00:02:00.400 --> 00:02:05.180
But the skeptics weren't only interested in the errors we fall into when doing astronomy--

00:02:05.180 --> 00:02:10.020
they were fascinated by our tendencies to fall into error in our personal lives

00:02:10.020 --> 00:02:12.320
under the influence of our emotions.

00:02:12.340 --> 00:02:16.600
For example, our minds are seldom free of the influence of moods:

00:02:16.600 --> 00:02:20.700
a kind of emotional weather that scouts over our mental horizons

00:02:20.700 --> 00:02:25.100
normally without us having any understanding of where these moods have come from,

00:02:25.100 --> 00:02:26.500
when they might lift,

00:02:26.500 --> 00:02:28.100
or even that they exist.

00:02:28.420 --> 00:02:31.660
However, these moods can have a decisive impact on our ideas.

00:02:32.140 --> 00:02:35.060
We might in one mood consider ourselves fortunate

00:02:35.060 --> 00:02:38.700
with a bright-lit future, and feel grateful to those around us.

00:02:38.800 --> 00:02:42.840
And then, a few hours later, without anything in the outer world having changed,

00:02:42.840 --> 00:02:48.640
another mood might lead us to a whole set of re-evaluation of almost everything about us.

00:02:49.240 --> 00:02:55.500
Devilishly, part of what it means to be subject to a mood is not to realize that we are in its grip.

00:02:55.500 --> 00:02:59.680
We simply feel that our friends, who we liked quite a lot yesterday, are no good.

00:02:59.680 --> 00:03:03.140
And our job, which once offered us so much, is absurd.

00:03:03.960 --> 00:03:09.840
Tiredness can be a particularly powerful agent that silently and invisibly perverts our judgement.

00:03:09.840 --> 00:03:13.060
The 19th century skeptic, Friedrich Nietzsche, remarked,

00:03:13.060 --> 00:03:17.660
"When we are tired, we are attacked by ideas we thought we'd conquered long ago."

00:03:18.300 --> 00:03:24.060
Though crucially, it's extremely rare and counter intuitive to judge that it really might be tiredness

00:03:24.080 --> 00:03:28.060
that's affecting our outlook rather than certain objective facts in the world.

00:03:28.400 --> 00:03:32.580
We are keener to conclude that we've suddenly developed a deep resentment against humanity

00:03:32.840 --> 00:03:35.160
that we urgently need to get to bed.

00:03:36.140 --> 00:03:38.500
Lust can similarly play with our judgement,

00:03:38.500 --> 00:03:43.260
leading us to see sensitivity, kindness, and a decent alternative to our current partner.

00:03:43.820 --> 00:03:47.280
But there is, in truth, just an exceptionally beautiful profile

00:03:47.380 --> 00:03:48.500
and perhaps not much else.

00:03:49.000 --> 00:03:52.960
As the German skeptical philosopher, Arthur Schopenhauer, wryly concluded,

00:03:53.040 --> 00:03:57.120
"Immediately after population, the devil's laughter can be heard."

00:03:57.780 --> 00:04:00.140
Appreciating how flawed our minds are

00:04:00.140 --> 00:04:04.100
forms the basis upon which the story on emotional skepticism is founded.

00:04:04.160 --> 00:04:10.820
This skill, defined as a cautious awareness of the misleading power of our feelings on our judgement

00:04:11.060 --> 00:04:13.180
Having surveyed the fragilities of our minds,

00:04:13.640 --> 00:04:15.880
the Ancient Greek skeptical philosophers

00:04:15.880 --> 00:04:20.480
recommended that we learn to develop an attitude of what they called "Epoche,"

00:04:20.480 --> 00:04:24.160
translated as "reserve," or "suspension of judgement."

00:04:24.700 --> 00:04:26.560
But where of our tendencies to error

00:04:26.680 --> 00:04:28.620
we were never to rush into decisions.

00:04:28.660 --> 00:04:30.380
We were to let our ideas settle

00:04:30.380 --> 00:04:33.440
so that they could be re-evaluated at different points in time

00:04:33.920 --> 00:04:38.600
and we were to be especially vigilant about the impact of sexual excitement and tiredness

00:04:38.760 --> 00:04:40.760
on the formation of our plans.

00:04:41.180 --> 00:04:43.060
For a range of historical reasons,

00:04:43.160 --> 00:04:49.120
we've collectively been extremely reluctant to recognize the benefits of emotional skepticism.

00:04:49.580 --> 00:04:51.840
The romantic movement of the 19th century

00:04:51.880 --> 00:04:55.240
bequeathed us that beguiling would often distract solution

00:04:55.340 --> 00:04:59.520
but it's our emotions that we always find us guides to the truth.

00:05:00.080 --> 00:05:04.120
But we would've gone a long way to counteract the problems of our minds

00:05:04.120 --> 00:05:08.040
if we sometimes do ourselves the honor of not listening to our feelings.

00:05:08.660 --> 00:05:12.020
Instead, waiting for some unhelpful moods to pass

00:05:12.340 --> 00:05:16.980
and accepting that we are at heart, highly viscous bags of saline solution

00:05:17.360 --> 00:05:22.920
who stare out at reality via a highly unreliable and distorted pane of glass

00:05:23.520 --> 00:05:28.240
and must therefore frequently suspend judgement, moderate our impulses,

00:05:28.360 --> 00:05:32.880
watch over our diet, and strive to get to bed early.
