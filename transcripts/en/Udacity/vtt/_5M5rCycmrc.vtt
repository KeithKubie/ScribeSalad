00:00:00.170 --> 00:00:04.458
First, we subtract 12 from both sides to get x squared plus 6x equals negative

00:00:04.458 --> 00:00:09.308
12. The b value is positive 6, so we need to add b over 2 squared, or 9, to

00:00:09.308 --> 00:00:14.375
both sides of our equation. This allows us to rewrite the left side as a

00:00:14.375 --> 00:00:20.850
perfect square. X plus 3 squared. The right side just simplifies to negative 3.

00:00:20.850 --> 00:00:24.446
Next we take the square root of both sides of the equation to get x plus 3

00:00:24.446 --> 00:00:30.318
equals plus or minus the square root of negative 3. This square root simplifies

00:00:30.318 --> 00:00:34.874
to plus or minus i root 3. It's an imaginary root here, since this radicand is

00:00:34.874 --> 00:00:40.125
negative. Finally, we subtract 3 from both sides to get x is equal to negative

00:00:40.125 --> 00:00:45.618
3 plus or minus i times root 3. Our final answers. Excellent work if you found

00:00:45.618 --> 00:00:47.760
these two imaginary solutions.
