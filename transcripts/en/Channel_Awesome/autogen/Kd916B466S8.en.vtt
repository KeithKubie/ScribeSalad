00:02:38.560 --> 00:02:38.570 align:start position:0%
was so I think he's having kind of
 

00:02:38.570 --> 00:02:40.540 align:start position:0%
was so I think he's having kind of
pissed<00:02:38.870><c> because</c><00:02:39.050><c> when</c><00:02:39.350><c> you</c><00:02:40.010><c> bring</c><00:02:40.220><c> one</c>

00:02:40.540 --> 00:02:40.550 align:start position:0%
pissed because when you bring one
 

00:02:40.550 --> 00:02:43.810 align:start position:0%
pissed because when you bring one
episode<00:02:40.970><c> back</c><00:02:41.180><c> and</c><00:02:41.450><c> then</c><00:02:41.540><c> another</c><00:02:42.069><c> like</c><00:02:43.069><c> weeks</c>

00:02:43.810 --> 00:02:43.820 align:start position:0%
episode back and then another like weeks
 

00:02:43.820 --> 00:02:46.240 align:start position:0%
episode back and then another like weeks
later<00:02:44.060><c> yeah</c><00:02:44.480><c> it'd</c><00:02:45.110><c> be</c><00:02:45.140><c> ten</c><00:02:45.470><c> episodes</c><00:02:46.010><c> as</c>

00:02:46.240 --> 00:02:46.250 align:start position:0%
later yeah it'd be ten episodes as
 

00:02:46.250 --> 00:02:48.820 align:start position:0%
later yeah it'd be ten episodes as
opposed<00:02:46.489><c> to</c><00:02:46.550><c> the</c><00:02:46.700><c> twenty</c><00:02:47.030><c> of</c><00:02:47.180><c> the</c><00:02:47.540><c> last</c><00:02:47.750><c> one</c><00:02:47.989><c> um</c>

00:02:48.820 --> 00:02:48.830 align:start position:0%
opposed to the twenty of the last one um
 

00:02:48.830 --> 00:02:51.130 align:start position:0%
opposed to the twenty of the last one um
so<00:02:48.980><c> probably</c><00:02:49.430><c> not</c><00:02:49.730><c> so</c><00:02:50.330><c> I'm</c><00:02:50.480><c> really</c><00:02:50.780><c> looking</c>

the brother won't come through so but
 

00:04:27.039 --> 00:04:28.649 align:start position:0%
the brother won't come through so but
they<00:04:27.189><c> thought</c><00:04:27.430><c> maybe</c><00:04:27.729><c> shall</c><00:04:28.030><c> we</c><00:04:28.180><c> have</c><00:04:28.300><c> no</c><00:04:28.449><c> idea</c>

they thought maybe shall we have no idea
 

00:04:28.659 --> 00:04:31.679 align:start position:0%
they thought maybe shall we have no idea
my<00:04:28.930><c> my</c><00:04:29.289><c> guess</c><00:04:29.740><c> is</c><00:04:30.099><c> that</c><00:04:30.430><c> an</c><00:04:30.729><c> unholy</c><00:04:31.270><c> terror</c>

00:04:31.679 --> 00:04:31.689 align:start position:0%
my my guess is that an unholy terror
 

00:04:31.689 --> 00:04:33.689 align:start position:0%
my my guess is that an unholy terror
will<00:04:32.110><c> be</c><00:04:32.259><c> unleashed</c><00:04:32.590><c> because</c><00:04:33.129><c> of</c><00:04:33.279><c> this</c><00:04:33.430><c> ah</c>

00:04:33.689 --> 00:04:33.699 align:start position:0%
will be unleashed because of this ah
 

00:04:33.699 --> 00:04:35.909 align:start position:0%
will be unleashed because of this ah
like<00:04:34.180><c> so</c><00:04:34.449><c> that's</c><00:04:34.629><c> the</c><00:04:34.870><c> trade-off</c><00:04:35.139><c> he</c><00:04:35.499><c> gets</c><00:04:35.740><c> his</c>

00:04:35.909 --> 00:04:35.919 align:start position:0%
like so that's the trade-off he gets his
 

00:04:35.919 --> 00:04:39.330 align:start position:0%
like so that's the trade-off he gets his
brother<00:04:36.219><c> back</c><00:04:36.689><c> but</c><00:04:37.740><c> something</c><00:04:38.740><c> by</c><00:04:39.099><c> not</c>

00:04:39.330 --> 00:04:39.340 align:start position:0%

pressing the button and shutting it down
 

00:04:40.900 --> 00:04:43.619 align:start position:0%
pressing the button and shutting it down
