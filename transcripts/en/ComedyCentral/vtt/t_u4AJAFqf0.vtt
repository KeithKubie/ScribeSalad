It's time for The Muppets
Take Unemployment.

00:00:03.170 --> 00:00:04.705
The Muppets Take Unemployment.

00:00:04.738 --> 00:00:06.573
(cheering, applause)

00:00:06.607 --> 00:00:09.309
Wait a minute.
Hey, stop.

00:00:09.343 --> 00:00:12.012
Why are you clapping? You don't
even know what you're cla...

00:00:12.045 --> 00:00:14.982
You're clapping for the fact
that ABC canceled <i>The Muppets!</i>

00:00:15.015 --> 00:00:17.985
-(booing)
-Yeah. Yeah.

00:00:18.018 --> 00:00:21.722
Yeah, you can suck it, ABC,
unless I can work for you.

00:00:21.755 --> 00:00:24.191
But... there's one thing I know:

00:00:24.224 --> 00:00:26.326
it's that the Muppets
will be back on TV and movies

00:00:26.360 --> 00:00:28.395
and the Internet and other
future forms of entertainment

00:00:28.428 --> 00:00:30.731
that we haven't even invented
yet until the end of time.

00:00:30.764 --> 00:00:32.332
And I say that is fantastic.

00:00:32.366 --> 00:00:33.667
So let's do some brainstorming.

00:00:33.700 --> 00:00:34.935
I would like you
to give me the names

00:00:34.968 --> 00:00:37.404
of as many future
Muppet projects as you can

00:00:37.437 --> 00:00:38.906
that hopefully will get made.

00:00:38.939 --> 00:00:41.108
I'm gonna put 60 seconds
on the clock. And begin.

00:00:41.141 --> 00:00:44.444
-Kristen.
-Uh. Dr. Bunsen Honeydew

00:00:46.813 --> 00:00:48.849
All right. Points.

00:00:48.882 --> 00:00:51.985
Yes, I see it!

00:00:52.019 --> 00:00:53.987

Fozzie.

00:01:01.295 --> 00:01:04.998
Uh, an <i>Animal House</i> remake
with Animal!

00:01:05.032 --> 00:01:08.836
Yeah, points.

00:01:08.869 --> 00:01:10.370

Miss Piggy
in <i>Silence of the Hams.</i>

00:01:17.544 --> 00:01:18.779
All right, perfect.

00:01:18.812 --> 00:01:21.048
Ah.

00:01:21.081 --> 00:01:22.583
-Oh.
-Hodgman.

00:01:22.616 --> 00:01:25.586
A new HBO political comedy
called <i>Meep.</i>

00:01:25.619 --> 00:01:27.921
Oh, perfect! So good!

00:01:27.955 --> 00:01:30.123
So good. Fozzie.

00:01:30.157 --> 00:01:32.926
Um, anything,
as long as I have a job.

00:01:32.960 --> 00:01:34.795
Yeah, points. Points.

00:01:34.828 --> 00:01:34.895
-Obviously!
-Obviously, yeah.
