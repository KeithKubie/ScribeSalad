00:00:00.600 --> 00:00:03.000
Golden hot bods, coming our way.

00:00:03.140 --> 00:00:04.860
SPF1 hottie.

00:00:04.860 --> 00:00:05.740
Heeey!

00:00:06.120 --> 00:00:07.800
Hey should we head to the pool?

00:00:07.800 --> 00:00:08.560
Yeah.

00:00:08.560 --> 00:00:09.400
Cool.

00:00:12.860 --> 00:00:16.100
Oh, hey uhm sorry you forgot your cellphone.

00:00:16.100 --> 00:00:18.640
Oh, thank you.

00:00:20.040 --> 00:00:23.840
Well well well, it looks like someone has a little crushy crush.

00:00:23.840 --> 00:00:25.320
Phil, what's our smell status?

00:00:25.320 --> 00:00:28.580
Uh, she put on some degree deodorant this morning after a shower.

00:00:28.580 --> 00:00:29.500
Is it holding?

00:00:29.500 --> 00:00:31.900
Still 85% effective, we're good.

00:00:31.900 --> 00:00:32.820
Excellent.

00:00:32.980 --> 00:00:34.600
You're going to let him get away?

00:00:35.300 --> 00:00:36.100
Uhm.

00:00:36.380 --> 00:00:38.620
Give me a line, Phil.  Quick!

00:00:38.620 --> 00:00:39.120
Uh.

00:00:39.400 --> 00:00:40.520
Hey fuck you!

00:00:42.720 --> 00:00:44.040
Uh, I'm sorry?

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:50.100
For...looking so hot and...not asking me out.

00:00:50.580 --> 00:00:51.800
Oh, it was a joke.

00:00:51.800 --> 00:00:52.300
Yeah.

00:00:53.160 --> 00:00:53.820
Ok.

00:00:55.900 --> 00:00:57.260
You got lucky, Phil.

00:00:57.260 --> 00:01:00.440
Should we just text him?  Say it was nice to meet him?

00:01:00.600 --> 00:01:01.720
What did you say?

00:01:02.020 --> 00:01:03.780
I just thought we could text him first.

00:01:07.040 --> 00:01:08.820
Are you trying to destroy her, Mitch?

00:01:08.820 --> 00:01:10.580
You know sometimes I like it when a girl texts first.

00:01:11.140 --> 00:01:11.860
It's nice.

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:13.500
Ah!

00:01:13.620 --> 00:01:15.300
We don't ever text first.

00:01:15.300 --> 00:01:16.280
*text message sound*

00:01:16.280 --> 00:01:16.980
Is that what I think it is?

00:01:16.980 --> 00:01:18.020
Incoming text.

00:01:18.020 --> 00:01:18.660
Read it, Mitch!

00:01:18.660 --> 00:01:22.320
I hope you're getting this and didn't leave your phone somewhere, Megan.

00:01:22.320 --> 00:01:24.080
Hahaha, how about a drink?

00:01:24.080 --> 00:01:24.580
Yes!

00:01:24.580 --> 00:01:25.620
What should we wear?

00:01:25.620 --> 00:01:26.260
Nothing.

00:01:26.260 --> 00:01:27.540
Risky but I like it.

00:01:27.540 --> 00:01:30.020
No, nothing because we're not going.

00:01:30.020 --> 00:01:32.200
This is a late night booty call text.

00:01:32.200 --> 00:01:34.680
Ah, first date should always be lunch or dinner.

00:01:34.680 --> 00:01:35.180
Right.

00:01:35.180 --> 00:01:37.040
Respond and say that we already have plans.

00:01:37.040 --> 00:01:37.620
Copy that.

00:01:37.620 --> 00:01:38.120
New text.

00:01:38.120 --> 00:01:39.040
Read it.

00:01:39.040 --> 00:01:43.160
It says: Of course.  Sorry hope I didn't come off too forward.  Just really excited to see you again.

00:01:43.160 --> 00:01:44.280
How about dinner tomorrow night?

00:01:44.280 --> 00:01:45.000
All right!

00:01:45.540 --> 00:01:47.060
Did you already respond to that, Phil?

00:01:47.060 --> 00:01:50.880
Yeah, I just said:  Sounds good.  Added a little winky face, if that's okay.

00:01:51.520 --> 00:01:53.720
No, it's not okay.

00:01:54.760 --> 00:01:59.820
That winky face could compromise our entire operation.

00:01:59.820 --> 00:02:05.020
Everything that we have worked for.  Confirm next time, Phil.

00:02:05.020 --> 00:02:07.740
Before you execute an action.

00:02:08.120 --> 00:02:09.880
Y-yes, captain.

00:02:09.880 --> 00:02:11.240
It's probably fine.

00:02:11.240 --> 00:02:13.600
See boys, all we need is a little patience.

00:02:14.320 --> 00:02:18.300
I don't want to be too optimistic but I think this could be the one.

00:02:18.300 --> 00:02:19.160
*Text message sound*

00:02:19.860 --> 00:02:21.080
Oh shit.

00:02:24.260 --> 00:02:25.760
Dick pic?

00:02:25.760 --> 00:02:26.800
Yeah.

00:02:28.200 --> 00:02:29.480
Damn.

00:02:29.480 --> 00:02:31.640
Well, there's always tomorrow.  Huh, Captain?

00:02:31.640 --> 00:02:32.520
Yes.

00:02:33.980 --> 00:02:35.420
Tomorrow's a new day.

00:02:37.380 --> 00:02:40.500
It's a shame we had to see that...dick pic.

00:02:40.500 --> 00:02:41.860
And not in real life.

00:02:47.500 --> 00:02:51.620
I'd like to say thank you to Audible for sponsoring today's episode

00:02:51.620 --> 00:02:54.540
and someone asked me to do a chipmunk voice

00:02:54.540 --> 00:02:55.800
so here it goes:

00:02:56.660 --> 00:02:59.080
Thanks so much to Audible for sponsoring today's episode.

00:03:01.540 --> 00:03:05.220
Right now I'm listening to "Death and The City of Light" because serial killers.

00:03:05.220 --> 00:03:07.420
