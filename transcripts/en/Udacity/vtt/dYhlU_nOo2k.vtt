00:00:00.400 --> 00:00:02.210
So, how do we do this
with other decimals?

00:00:03.350 --> 00:00:07.010
Once we know how to state the number,
we can make the conversion.

00:00:07.010 --> 00:00:08.620
Let's look at these three decimals.

00:00:08.620 --> 00:00:12.240
How would we talk about these numbers?

00:00:12.240 --> 00:00:16.754
Well I'd say three-tenths,
nineteen-hundredths, and

00:00:16.754 --> 00:00:20.640
two-hundred-and-eleven-thousandths.

00:00:20.640 --> 00:00:24.130
The number written in purple
becomes the numerator, and

00:00:24.130 --> 00:00:28.840
the word written in green
becomes the denominator tenths.

00:00:28.840 --> 00:00:32.106
This becomes nineteen-hundredths and

00:00:32.106 --> 00:00:37.011
this becomes
two-hundred-and-eleven-thousandths.

00:00:37.011 --> 00:00:42.760
So what is the equivalent fraction
of eighty-one-hundredths?

00:00:42.760 --> 00:00:45.840
Write your answer here with
the numerator up on the top, and

00:00:45.840 --> 00:00:47.390
the denominator down on the bottom.
