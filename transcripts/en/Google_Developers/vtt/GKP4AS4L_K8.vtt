[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:00:05.320 --> 00:00:06.070
IDO GREEN: Hi.

00:00:06.070 --> 00:00:07.690
Welcome to our new
series of videos

00:00:07.690 --> 00:00:10.570
that will bring you news and
best practices for Actions

00:00:10.570 --> 00:00:11.870
on Google.

00:00:11.870 --> 00:00:14.920
I'm Ido Green, a developer
advocate for Actions on Google.

00:00:14.920 --> 00:00:16.884
I love to help
entrepreneurs and developers

00:00:16.884 --> 00:00:17.800
to be more productive.

00:00:17.800 --> 00:00:20.260
And in this video,
we are going to learn

00:00:20.260 --> 00:00:23.110
how to make sure your apps
for the Google Assistant

00:00:23.110 --> 00:00:25.510
will pass the review process.

00:00:25.510 --> 00:00:28.540
After you design conversation
and develop apps,

00:00:28.540 --> 00:00:31.450
you're probably ready to
share them with users.

00:00:31.450 --> 00:00:33.520
Before you make your app
available to the Google

00:00:33.520 --> 00:00:38.410
Assistant users, let's see
how to prepare for deployment.

00:00:38.410 --> 00:00:40.750
When you submit your
app for approval,

00:00:40.750 --> 00:00:42.880
Google tests and
verify that they

00:00:42.880 --> 00:00:45.430
meet the minimal set of
[INAUDIBLE] requirements

00:00:45.430 --> 00:00:47.800
before publishing them to users.

00:00:47.800 --> 00:00:50.830
Let's focus on the
top three pitfalls

00:00:50.830 --> 00:00:54.490
you need to avoid in order
to pass the review process.

00:00:54.490 --> 00:00:57.490
One, incomplete
store listing data.

00:00:57.490 --> 00:01:01.540
Two, naming, directory
listing, and pronunciation.

00:01:01.540 --> 00:01:04.660
Three, no response and no lead.

00:01:04.660 --> 00:01:06.520
Let's dive into
each of these issues

00:01:06.520 --> 00:01:08.830
and see how you could get
your app through the review

00:01:08.830 --> 00:01:11.950
process for the first time.

00:01:11.950 --> 00:01:16.127
Incomplete store listing data
when submitting for review.

00:01:16.127 --> 00:01:17.960
You could see in the
image on the right what

00:01:17.960 --> 00:01:19.970
are the top missing parts.

00:01:19.970 --> 00:01:23.450
It's the app name,
pronunciation,

00:01:23.450 --> 00:01:26.600
picking a name with a
recognizable pronunciation

00:01:26.600 --> 00:01:28.280
is critical.

00:01:28.280 --> 00:01:32.740
Invocation, how the
user will call your app.

00:01:32.740 --> 00:01:37.220
For example, OK Google,
talk to Bitcoin Info.

00:01:37.220 --> 00:01:40.320
Please make sure that the
images are in high quality

00:01:40.320 --> 00:01:43.220
and that the app
description is accurate.

00:01:43.220 --> 00:01:47.630
The large banner image
should be 1920 by 1080.

00:01:47.630 --> 00:01:54.820
And the small square
should be 192 by 192.

00:01:54.820 --> 00:01:58.030
Another important part
is your privacy policy.

00:01:58.030 --> 00:02:03.010
We frequently see example.com
for the privacy policy, which,

00:02:03.010 --> 00:02:04.330
of course, is not good.

00:02:04.330 --> 00:02:08.050
It must be public, on the
web, and related to your app.

00:02:08.050 --> 00:02:10.990
If you don't have a website
you could create one for free

00:02:10.990 --> 00:02:13.690
with Google Sites
or other services.

00:02:13.690 --> 00:02:17.160
Here is one that I've
created for our assistant app

00:02:17.160 --> 00:02:22.100
Bitcoin Info, naming directory
listing and pronunciation.

00:02:22.100 --> 00:02:24.080
All apps must have
a unique name that

00:02:24.080 --> 00:02:27.260
will allow users to trigger
the app functionality.

00:02:27.260 --> 00:02:30.050
Your directory listing must
have at least one sample

00:02:30.050 --> 00:02:33.740
of invocation, all of which
must include your app name--

00:02:33.740 --> 00:02:36.740
for example, "talk
to Bitcoin Info"--

00:02:36.740 --> 00:02:38.900
which consistently
trigger your app.

00:02:38.900 --> 00:02:42.320
A few important things
to remember about names--

00:02:42.320 --> 00:02:44.810
one-word names are not
allowed unless the name

00:02:44.810 --> 00:02:47.900
is unique to your
brand or trademark.

00:02:47.900 --> 00:02:51.450
An app name uniquely
identifies your app.

00:02:51.450 --> 00:02:54.750
So it must distinguish
itself from other apps

00:02:54.750 --> 00:02:57.650
and for features
of the assistant.

00:02:57.650 --> 00:02:59.540
You should avoid
very common phrases

00:02:59.540 --> 00:03:03.300
like thank you, good
evening, or oh my god.

00:03:03.300 --> 00:03:06.050
And don't use generic
words or phrases

00:03:06.050 --> 00:03:09.650
such as categories of
products, services, or content.

00:03:09.650 --> 00:03:11.960
For example, travel or sport.

00:03:11.960 --> 00:03:13.680
Think of it this way.

00:03:13.680 --> 00:03:16.150
If your name can describe
a category of apps

00:03:16.150 --> 00:03:19.880
rather than a specific function,
change it to be more specific.

00:03:19.880 --> 00:03:23.490
Some words and phrases are
reserved and cannot be used

00:03:23.490 --> 00:03:28.490
in names, including OK, Google,
volume, up, down, game, bot,

00:03:28.490 --> 00:03:30.350
action, and app.

00:03:30.350 --> 00:03:32.870
For example, "talk
to Bitcoin Info"

00:03:32.870 --> 00:03:35.570
is a good one because
it's specific enough.

00:03:35.570 --> 00:03:38.740
And "talk to Bitcoin" or
"talk to Cryptocurrency"

00:03:38.740 --> 00:03:41.900
is not good because it's
describing a category and not

00:03:41.900 --> 00:03:43.400
a specific action.

00:03:43.400 --> 00:03:45.890
You could test your name in
Actions on Google console

00:03:45.890 --> 00:03:49.550
to confirm it doesn't use
a reserve word or phrase.

00:03:49.550 --> 00:03:51.725
Also double-check that
your display and invocation

00:03:51.725 --> 00:03:53.005
name match.

00:03:53.005 --> 00:03:55.550
That doesn't mean that
they match verbatim,

00:03:55.550 --> 00:03:57.770
but rather match
in pronunciation.

00:03:57.770 --> 00:03:59.720
This invocation name
is what is actually

00:03:59.720 --> 00:04:01.790
listened for by the assistant.

00:04:01.790 --> 00:04:04.310
Always respond and lead.

00:04:04.310 --> 00:04:06.980
Don't leave the mic open
without an audio cue.

00:04:06.980 --> 00:04:08.990
You want to give the
users an easy way

00:04:08.990 --> 00:04:11.180
to move forward with
the conversation

00:04:11.180 --> 00:04:12.770
and reach their goal.

00:04:12.770 --> 00:04:13.820
That was it.

00:04:13.820 --> 00:04:14.960
Good luck.

00:04:14.960 --> 00:04:17.360
