00:00:00.290 --> 00:00:03.670
Now that you've learned the basics about drawing texts let's combine it all and

00:00:03.670 --> 00:00:05.390
make a simple mean generator.

00:00:05.390 --> 00:00:08.260
We've given you a head start with some basic HTML.

00:00:08.260 --> 00:00:11.120
Inside this HTML, you'll find a few things but

00:00:11.120 --> 00:00:12.470
let me point out what's important.

00:00:12.470 --> 00:00:16.520
Here in this section of HTML we're creating the top line and

00:00:16.520 --> 00:00:19.680
bottom line entries, which you can see right here.

00:00:19.680 --> 00:00:22.110
This is where a user will be able to type in text that they want to

00:00:22.110 --> 00:00:23.450
appear on the image.

00:00:23.450 --> 00:00:24.570
Inside the script tag,

00:00:24.570 --> 00:00:29.230
we'll find all the necessary components to start building the meme generator.

00:00:29.230 --> 00:00:33.120
We can see here, in this if statement, we're getting the text that was made in

00:00:33.120 --> 00:00:36.080
the top and bottom lines, and then we have this function called

00:00:36.080 --> 00:00:40.500
redraw meme where we get the canvas and select the context like we did before.

00:00:40.500 --> 00:00:42.700
After that we can see a place where your code goes.

00:00:42.700 --> 00:00:45.630
Then we've got this save file function which is going to let us use

00:00:45.630 --> 00:00:49.610
the toDataURL method to hopefully save our images.

00:00:49.610 --> 00:00:53.120
Then we've got this handleFileSelect method which will help us load a file from

00:00:53.120 --> 00:00:56.190
the disk as an image for the background.

00:00:56.190 --> 00:00:59.430
But the most important thing is that your code goes within this redraw

00:00:59.430 --> 00:01:00.360
mean function.

00:01:00.360 --> 00:01:02.690
So put together everything that you've learned so far.

00:01:02.690 --> 00:01:03.860
Use the background image and

00:01:03.860 --> 00:01:06.110
put some text over it to create this meme generator.

00:01:07.150 --> 00:01:09.690
So, now that you've got the starter code for a simple meme maker,

00:01:09.690 --> 00:01:13.490
can you use the canvas to load images with that iconic meme text?

00:01:13.490 --> 00:01:15.370
