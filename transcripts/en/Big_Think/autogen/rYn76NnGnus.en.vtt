out ninety-five percent of every living
 

00:01:58.140 --> 00:02:01.060
out ninety-five percent of every living
form on earth and that was due to a

00:02:01.060 --> 00:02:01.070
form on earth and that was due to a
 

00:02:01.070 --> 00:02:03.319

Siberia that lasted about a million
 

00:02:06.180 --> 00:02:07.429
Siberia that lasted about a million
years and came up right through the

00:02:07.429 --> 00:02:07.439
years and came up right through the
 

00:02:07.439 --> 00:02:09.949
years and came up right through the
carboniferous layer and you know so talk

00:02:09.949 --> 00:02:09.959
carboniferous layer and you know so talk
 

00:02:09.959 --> 00:02:11.210
carboniferous layer and you know so talk
about global warming that was pretty

00:02:11.210 --> 00:02:11.220
about global warming that was pretty
 

00:02:11.220 --> 00:02:13.430
about global warming that was pretty
intense and and then this asteroid hits

00:02:13.430 --> 00:02:13.440
intense and and then this asteroid hits
 

00:02:13.440 --> 00:02:13.950

apparently and you know and yet life

00:02:16.920 --> 00:02:16.930
apparently and you know and yet life
 

00:02:16.930 --> 00:02:19.110
apparently and you know and yet life
comes back and eventually it took

00:02:19.110 --> 00:02:19.120
comes back and eventually it took
 

00:02:19.120 --> 00:02:24.180
comes back and eventually it took
millions of years but it got so so

00:02:24.180 --> 00:02:24.190
millions of years but it got so so
 

00:02:24.190 --> 00:02:26.070
millions of years but it got so so
successful that we got this age of

00:02:26.070 --> 00:02:26.080
successful that we got this age of
 

00:02:26.080 --> 00:02:28.050
successful that we got this age of
dinosaurs which was rather amazing and

00:02:28.050 --> 00:02:28.060
dinosaurs which was rather amazing and
 

00:02:28.060 --> 00:02:30.090
dinosaurs which was rather amazing and
then another asteroid eventually

00:02:30.090 --> 00:02:30.100
then another asteroid eventually
 

00:02:30.100 --> 00:02:32.550
then another asteroid eventually
millions of years later knocks them

00:02:32.550 --> 00:02:32.560
millions of years later knocks them
 

00:02:32.560 --> 00:02:34.950
millions of years later knocks them
about and after another huge died back

00:02:34.950 --> 00:02:34.960
about and after another huge died back
 

00:02:34.960 --> 00:02:36.870
about and after another huge died back
then we get the age of mammals of which

00:02:36.870 --> 00:02:36.880
then we get the age of mammals of which
 

00:02:36.880 --> 00:02:38.460
then we get the age of mammals of which
we are currently apart and you know this
