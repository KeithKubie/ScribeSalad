This is a solid chunk of sodium metal this stuff is number Eleven on the periodic table of elements

00:00:05.230 --> 00:00:07.100
and it is extremely reactive

00:00:07.230 --> 00:00:08.800
if it comes in contact with water

00:00:08.800 --> 00:00:13.229
So a few months ago one of you left a comment asking me to flush a piece of sodium down a toilet

00:00:13.330 --> 00:00:20.160
Which seems like a ridiculous request, but I have got cody from cody's lab to come out here with his infamous Mercury flushing toilet

00:00:20.160 --> 00:00:25.379
So we can put that experiment to the test. This is the same toilet. I use for my flushing mercury experiment

00:00:25.380 --> 00:00:28.740
I've cleaned out all the mercury and now I've got a spare toilet

00:00:28.740 --> 00:00:32.189
So there's a pretty good use now if you take a quick look at sodium

00:00:32.189 --> 00:00:36.779
It's a very Bendy very flexible metal I kind of think it's about the hardness of Beeswax

00:00:37.390 --> 00:00:40.919
Sodium Metal is incredibly reactive it only has one electron in its outer shell

00:00:40.920 --> 00:00:47.700
And so it's actually higher in the activity series and hydrogen now most people will store sodium in a container of oil because it prevents

00:00:47.700 --> 00:00:51.089
An oxide layer from forming I just cut mine kind of in a jar

00:00:51.090 --> 00:00:53.070
So you can see it's got that crusty coating

00:00:53.070 --> 00:00:57.930
But if we take a knife, we can cut this open and for a brief second you can see that shiny metal

00:00:58.120 --> 00:01:03.570
but within seconds you can see it's]oxidizing and forms that white scaly exterior coating a

00:01:05.229 --> 00:01:09.989
Sodium metal does not like to be confined this piece is only the size a little bit bigger than a Marvel

00:01:09.990 --> 00:01:15.479
But if we throw this into the toilet, and then drop a block of wood on top it creates enough pressure enough

00:01:15.479 --> 00:01:19.769
Heat quickly the wood will get blasted back out 10 to 20 feet in the air. No problem. I

00:01:28.689 --> 00:01:31.859
Think it like bounced around and it finally landed on top of it

00:01:36.640 --> 00:01:43.919
It's like a good 30 30 feet from the flush zone if you feel this block would it's actually really slippery really slimy

00:01:44.620 --> 00:01:46.679
So check this out we rigged up this contraption

00:01:46.680 --> 00:01:50.639
It's just a long piece of PVC pipe so we can flush the toilet from about ten feet away

00:01:50.640 --> 00:01:52.500
he's going to drop this into the toilet Bowl

00:01:52.500 --> 00:01:55.529
We're going to let it fizz around for a bit, and then we're going to flush it and see what happens

00:01:57.460 --> 00:01:59.460
there you go

00:02:07.990 --> 00:02:11.820
i Can hear it crackling fizzing all right flush it okay Here we go

00:02:28.720 --> 00:02:31.470
That's what you call explosive experience on the toilets

00:02:32.530 --> 00:02:38.010
This is the biggest chunk of sodium I've ever thrown into water so a little bit nervous about this one. We're definitely

00:02:38.680 --> 00:02:43.440
Flushing this from a distance, and I think we would actually have Cody throw a heading this time go for the smoosh

00:02:53.090 --> 00:02:55.090
That reaction actually was pretty cool

00:02:57.530 --> 00:03:02.500
This time we're gonna do the same thing we're going to flush it and see if we can make it go off during the flushing

00:03:02.500 --> 00:03:06.610
Process, I'm wondering if we should go a little bit bigger just to take it to the next level

00:03:06.680 --> 00:03:10.450
This is the grand finale. we've got a whole handful of sodium here like six chunks

00:03:10.450 --> 00:03:12.640
I'm going to throw them in and at that exact moment

00:03:13.159 --> 00:03:18.369
Cody is Gonna flush, and hopefully we'll get some kind of epic reaction ready for this

00:03:40.400 --> 00:03:47.230
My goodness that's amazing check that out. It's still smoking. We got fired a little bit

00:03:49.670 --> 00:03:55.660
Right in my face dang it that was epic. Oh my gosh guys. This is insane

00:03:56.620 --> 00:04:01.959
Oh, we finally destroy the toilet that used to be a toilet now. It's a big mess that we need to clean up I

00:04:02.810 --> 00:04:07.359
Honestly have to say I wasn't expecting that to go off like when you flushed it and nothing happened

00:04:07.359 --> 00:04:10.388
I just sitting there thinking okay another fail, and then boom

00:04:14.360 --> 00:04:15.500
crazy

00:04:15.500 --> 00:04:20.799
So we broke a toilet I guess that's what happens when you flush a substantial amount of sodium down it

00:04:20.799 --> 00:04:24.159
this is not something you want [to] try at home this is for demonstrational and

00:04:24.620 --> 00:04:29.829
Educational purposes only you can see this is pretty dangerous stuff, and it is reacting with our skin right now

00:04:29.830 --> 00:04:33.490
It's probably turning my forehead into a bar of soap, but we did this for you guys

00:04:33.490 --> 00:04:35.380
Thanks for the request this is a ton of fun

00:04:35.380 --> 00:04:41.380
I've never seen a toilet explode before anyway huge thanks to my friend cody for coming down here and making this possible for

00:04:41.780 --> 00:04:46.600
Sacrificing this toilet on our behalf luckily. He's got a backup and we're going to do a video on his channel

00:04:47.180 --> 00:04:52.180
Flushing liquid nitrogen down a toilet can the ceramic Withstand liquid nitrogen?

00:04:52.180 --> 00:04:56.650
We're not sure so we're going to test that out go over to cody's channel and check them out give him a subscribe

00:04:56.650 --> 00:05:01.479
He's got some epic content. Thanks for joining us for this experiment. We'll see you the next one. Talk to you then all

00:05:02.280 --> 00:05:04.220
right let's clean up this mess

00:05:04.220 --> 00:05:07.700
i got this toilet. It's got a lifetime warranty wonder if people. Take it back
