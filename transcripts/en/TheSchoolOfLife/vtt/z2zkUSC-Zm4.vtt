00:00:03.669 --> 00:00:10.630
There are, for many of us, few people as attractive
as the avoidant; the sort that are permanently

00:00:10.630 --> 00:00:16.139
a little mysterious; who don’t speak so
much; around whom one never quite knows where

00:00:16.139 --> 00:00:22.730
one is; in whose eyes there is a faraway look,
and perhaps a certain melancholy too; in whose

00:00:22.730 --> 00:00:30.050
hearts we intuit a sadness we long to, but
never quite can, touch; people who seem to

00:00:30.050 --> 00:00:35.489
promise us intimacy and connection, and yet
who remain – however long we have been with

00:00:35.489 --> 00:00:44.769
them – mesmerisingly unreassuring. Unsurprisingly,
it is not so easy to be the lover of an avoidant

00:00:44.769 --> 00:00:51.129
person. The tendency, very often, after the
heady early days, is to give into the insecurities

00:00:51.129 --> 00:00:57.799
they end up provoking in us: do they really
care? Do they love us back? Why are they never

00:00:57.799 --> 00:01:04.989
the ones to call? Beset by such questions,
we may get cross, tearful or stern. We may

00:01:04.989 --> 00:01:11.369
accuse them of neglect and selfishness, of
betrayal or egocentricity. These sort of inquisitions

00:01:11.369 --> 00:01:18.909
can be counted on to fail. At the first signs
of critique, avoidant people pull up the drawbridge.

00:01:18.909 --> 00:01:25.920
They are experts at fleeing the messy consequences
of other people’s desire for them. They

00:01:25.920 --> 00:01:32.460
go off to play sport, abscond on a long journey
or discover new responsibilities at the office.

00:01:32.460 --> 00:01:40.130
One is left hammering in vain at the gates
of their personal citadel. On a bad day, they

00:01:40.130 --> 00:01:46.399
may also get furious back. They will deny
that we have any kind of point at all. They

00:01:46.399 --> 00:01:51.451
aren’t trying to deceive us; they genuinely
can’t see the issue. They aren’t – they

00:01:51.451 --> 00:01:57.229
assure us with mounting vehemence – distant
and cold, they are simply busy and not into

00:01:57.229 --> 00:02:03.740
certain kinds of sentimentality. It is we
– needy, weak, hysterical and over-demanding,

00:02:03.740 --> 00:02:08.520
as they put it – who are the problem. We
almost agree.

00:02:08.520 --> 00:02:13.980
To survive, we should hold on to the
idea that, despite their robust outward manner,

00:02:13.980 --> 00:02:21.280
the avoidant are, above all else, scared.
Their frostiness is the result of fear rather

00:02:21.280 --> 00:02:27.150
than indifference – and what they are afraid
of is to let down their guard and then meet

00:02:27.150 --> 00:02:34.660
with betrayal and abandonment. Their outward
strength masks a gelatinous interior. There

00:02:34.660 --> 00:02:41.430
will, inevitably, be a rather touching backstory
to their advanced subterranean fears. They

00:02:41.430 --> 00:02:48.000
were, way back, most likely let down very
badly by someone they depended on a lot when

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:53.769
they were defenceless. In response to a grave
childhood disappointment, they grew an extra

00:02:53.769 --> 00:03:00.540
thick skin and plated themselves with armour.
They vowed, in a way they may not now even

00:03:00.540 --> 00:03:07.190
recognise, never to trust anyone fully again.
Related image So they are distant and prone

00:03:07.190 --> 00:03:13.599
to put up barriers not because they don’t
care, but because being cared for with kindness

00:03:13.599 --> 00:03:19.099
generates unfamiliar and daunting feelings
for them. They skillfully undermine their

00:03:19.099 --> 00:03:25.019
chances of being close, because they have
no experience of reliable love – and are

00:03:25.019 --> 00:03:31.459
drawn to try to spoil it to prove to themselves
that it can’t be real (and that they haven’t,

00:03:31.459 --> 00:03:37.370
therefore, missed out on quite so much). We
should avoid getting stuck in cycles of claim

00:03:37.370 --> 00:03:43.750
and counter-claim; that they might be too
cold and that we might be too hot. Far better

00:03:43.750 --> 00:03:49.239
to address the fears circulating beneath the
surface. Rather than provoking their panic

00:03:49.239 --> 00:03:55.650
or denial, we should – as best we can – make
closeness feel safe. We should remember that

00:03:55.650 --> 00:04:01.400
we are dealing with someone who finds vulnerability
frightening and therefore not meet their impulse

00:04:01.400 --> 00:04:05.819
to flee with punitiveness. But more crucially,

00:04:05.819 --> 00:04:13.359
we might along the way, start to ask ourselves
a few key questions. How similar are we to

00:04:13.359 --> 00:04:18.720
them, beneath the apparent differences? It
is easy to claim that one has an uncomplicated

00:04:18.720 --> 00:04:23.900
desire to be close – so long as one isn’t
put to the test, because one has carefully

00:04:23.900 --> 00:04:30.670
picked out a person who has problems being
so. Yet in truth, how simple is closeness

00:04:30.670 --> 00:04:37.170
for us really? Might we not be as scared as
they are – but simply have passed our share

00:04:37.170 --> 00:04:42.230
of the problem on to them to hold? Shouldn’t
we be suspicious of the way that we managed

00:04:42.230 --> 00:04:49.000
to reject other warmer candidates in favour
of this distant figure? Is it really an accident

00:04:49.000 --> 00:04:55.200
that we are with them? Or isn’t it in some
way satisfying to us as well, allowing us

00:04:55.200 --> 00:05:01.910
to claim that we want intimacy without having
to bear any of its costs? Through

00:05:01.910 --> 00:05:06.980
such pointed questions, we stand to realise
that, most probably, the fear of closeness

00:05:06.980 --> 00:05:16.040
exists on both sides. It’s just that they
are directly distant and we are so by proxy.

00:05:16.040 --> 00:05:21.580
We can break away from caricatures and, as
a couple, own up to our mutual terrors of

00:05:21.580 --> 00:05:26.450
dependence. We can start to sympathise with
one another’s techniques for warding off

00:05:26.450 --> 00:05:33.550
anxiety and help each other to accept the
common risks of love. That will be the beginning

00:05:33.600 --> 00:05:37.760
of true closeness – and bravery – on both
sides.
