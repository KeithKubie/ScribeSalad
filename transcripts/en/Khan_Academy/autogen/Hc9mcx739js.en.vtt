00:00:00.480 --> 00:00:04.682
 Mike is not sure how to solve the example of 189 + 608. 

00:00:04.682 --> 00:00:06.982
 The same as the 189 + 608 operation 

00:00:06.982 --> 00:00:10.650
 Let's help Mike by choosing the collection task. 

00:00:10.650 --> 00:00:12.287
 Let's look at these choices. 

00:00:12.287 --> 00:00:15.722
 Starting with the first selection, 

00:00:15.722 --> 00:00:19.890
 in fact, all these choices begin with a hundredths, 

00:00:19.890 --> 00:00:22.340
 Each of them has one hundred, but where do we see one hundredths here? 

00:00:22.340 --> 00:00:26.125
 There are 189 numbers on the floor, 1 figure. 

00:00:26.125 --> 00:00:30.966
 This figure here is a hundred, that is, 100 units. 

00:00:30.966 --> 00:00:35.284
 In addition, all other options have six hundred. 

00:00:35.284 --> 00:00:38.894
 6 hundredths, 6 hundredths, so what do we get? 

00:00:38.894 --> 00:00:42.540
 The number 608 is 6 on the floor, 

00:00:42.540 --> 00:00:45.385
 therefore, here is 6 figures representing 6 hundredths. 

00:00:45.385 --> 00:00:48.422
 Thus, we learned that 1 hundredth and 6 hundredths have come. 

00:00:48.422 --> 00:00:51.943
 then there are 8 decimal places in each of them, 

00:00:51.943 --> 00:00:53.870
 all of them are identical. 

00:00:53.870 --> 00:00:56.564
 therefore, they have 8, 8, 8 and 8 decimal places. 

00:00:56.564 --> 00:00:57.992
 how are they 

00:00:57.992 --> 00:01:01.486
 The figure of 189 is 8 digits on the floor, 

00:01:01.486 --> 00:01:04.702
 where it refers to eighteen. 

00:01:04.702 --> 00:01:08.103
 8 decimal, and then what are you here? 

00:01:08.103 --> 00:01:09.426
 Here are some minor changes already made. 

00:01:09.427 --> 00:01:12.810
 Let's go one by one. 

00:01:12.810 --> 00:01:17.251
 The next nine are loneliness. 

00:01:17.251 --> 00:01:19.886
 9 loneliness, where do we get them? 

00:01:19.886 --> 00:01:23.822
 189, 9 digits are on the floor alone. 

00:01:23.822 --> 00:01:26.968
 in this case, it is desirable to mark 9 here. 

00:01:26.968 --> 00:01:30.509
 and finally, here 8 alone 

00:01:30.509 --> 00:01:32.228
 and 8 alone, how do we get them? 

00:01:32.228 --> 00:01:35.547
 608, 8 digits are on the solitude floor, 

00:01:35.547 --> 00:01:39.783
 where the figure is loneliness. and when it is given, everything appears in the order. 

00:01:39.784 --> 00:01:40.783
 But here you can think of a moment. 

00:01:40.783 --> 00:01:43.630
 "Well, we have all considered these figures, 

00:01:43.630 --> 00:01:45.898
 0 except why we did not take it into account. 

00:01:45.898 --> 00:01:48.744
 Why is there 0 in the field of decimal? 

00:01:48.745 --> 00:01:50.848
 Hence, 0 here simply has 0 decimal function, 

00:01:50.848 --> 00:01:53.158
 which means zero. 

00:01:53.158 --> 00:01:55.133
 it does not affect the price of anything. 

00:01:55.133 --> 00:01:57.464
 the first one is the same. 

00:01:57.465 --> 00:02:00.762
 as in the case of an initial baseline. 

00:02:00.762 --> 00:02:04.100
 if we want to know which of the other data is incorrect, 

00:02:04.100 --> 00:02:08.560
 this is 8 times twofold, but we have one ten. 

00:02:08.560 --> 00:02:10.721
 Here we have a tenth of ten, which is on the 8th floor. 

00:02:10.722 --> 00:02:13.683
 In this case, "solitude" should be written here. 

00:02:13.683 --> 00:02:17.370
 and we have eight singles. 

00:02:17.380 --> 00:02:19.360
 but here, in fact, is solitude. 

00:02:19.360 --> 00:02:21.577
 This is not a decimal, where "solitude" should be mentioned. 

00:02:21.577 --> 00:02:23.899
 That's why we will not accept these two. 

00:02:23.899 --> 00:02:27.877
 Let's solve one or more similar examples. 

00:02:27.877 --> 00:02:29.969
 Which is the collection matter 

00:02:29.969 --> 00:02:33.939
 525 + 379 operation is the same? 

00:02:33.939 --> 00:02:35.322
 Let's read: 

00:02:35.322 --> 00:02:38.898
 Here are hundreds of floors on the floor 5 figures, 

00:02:38.898 --> 00:02:41.555
 which means 500 numbers. 

00:02:41.556 --> 00:02:44.481
 then there are 3 figures on the floor floor. 

00:02:44.481 --> 00:02:48.528
 in this case + 300, 

00:02:48.528 --> 00:02:51.738
 then, there are 2 digits on the ground floor, 

00:02:51.738 --> 00:02:53.641
 ultimately, two are 10 or 20, 

00:02:53.641 --> 00:02:56.542
 After that, the figure on the floor is 7. 

00:02:56.543 --> 00:03:01.408
 in this case, + 70, and, ultimately, but not the least 

00:03:01.408 --> 00:03:05.660
 We see the figure 5 on the floor, which means 5 digits. 

00:03:05.660 --> 00:03:07.839
 then on the solitude floor 9 

00:03:07.839 --> 00:03:10.299
 Will indicate the figure 9. 

00:03:10.299 --> 00:03:11.438
 in this case, which of these data is 

00:03:11.438 --> 00:03:14.259
 is the same as what I wrote first? 

00:03:14.259 --> 00:03:19.530
 500 + 300, 500 or 300 are not marked on this first. 

00:03:19.530 --> 00:03:20.191
 in this case we do not count it. 

00:03:20.191 --> 00:03:24.920
 500 + 300 + 20 + 70 + 5 +9, 

00:03:24.920 --> 00:03:26.437
 This is exactly the same thing as I wrote a note. 

00:03:26.437 --> 00:03:30.221
 This latter is not appropriate because 9 instead of 9 is marked, 

00:03:30.221 --> 00:03:33.797
 then 5 and then 70 instead of 70. 

00:03:33.797 --> 00:03:37.859
 The figure 7 had to be marked on the floor, not on the floor alone. 

00:03:37.860 --> 00:03:41.770
 We do not just register it.
