00:00:00.350 --> 00:00:01.260
All right, munchkins.

00:00:01.260 --> 00:00:05.190
This is the wizard welcome you back
to introduction to computer vision.

00:00:05.190 --> 00:00:09.030
As you can tell, I'm, sort of,
energized and I've taken some time off,

00:00:09.030 --> 00:00:10.950
about a year or two or so.

00:00:10.950 --> 00:00:15.280
What we're going to do this time
is start working on tracking.

00:00:15.280 --> 00:00:18.660
So the last unit or
at least some previous one, hopefully,

00:00:18.660 --> 00:00:21.090
that depending upon the order
in which you're viewing these.

00:00:21.090 --> 00:00:24.600
We were looking at motion which
was sort of the change in imagery

00:00:24.600 --> 00:00:27.540
between two successive frames.

00:00:27.540 --> 00:00:32.080
And that change could be due to a change
in viewpoint multiple cameras or

00:00:32.080 --> 00:00:35.250
a change in time, you're watching
something move over awhile.

00:00:35.250 --> 00:00:40.760
This unit is going to focus on tracking,
where objects are moving over time and

00:00:40.760 --> 00:00:43.960
the computations that we're
doing are to keep track of them.

00:00:43.960 --> 00:00:48.550
And it is sort of a fundamental
part of computer vision these days.

00:00:48.550 --> 00:00:51.280
Although, a lot of what we're going to
be talking about will eventually get

00:00:51.280 --> 00:00:53.780
into things that are come
from the domain of robotics.

00:00:53.780 --> 00:00:57.380
Because there has just been a lot
of work done on sort of how you

00:00:57.380 --> 00:01:00.578
keep track of things overtime,
we'll do a lot of modelling.

00:01:00.578 --> 00:01:03.930
Also, I want to say again, a bunch of
slides adapted from Kristen Grauman,

00:01:03.930 --> 00:01:07.890
Deva Ramanan and
Svetlana Laze, Lazebnik.

00:01:07.890 --> 00:01:10.530
And I, Svetlana, if I messed
up your name, I'm, I'm sorry.
