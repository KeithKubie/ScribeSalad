00:00:02.640 --> 00:00:07.410
I think it's interesting to think about

00:00:07.410 --> 00:00:11.010
what if we started every design and

00:00:11.010 --> 00:00:14.430
technology company or every design and

00:00:14.430 --> 00:00:16.230
technology product that we're creating

00:00:16.230 --> 00:00:19.830
with three questions and the first

00:00:19.830 --> 00:00:22.410
question is what is really desirable

00:00:22.460 --> 00:00:25.409
about this thing? The second question is

00:00:25.409 --> 00:00:26.369
for whom?

00:00:26.369 --> 00:00:28.529
So who are we really designing for? And

00:00:28.529 --> 00:00:33.180
we do an okay job of asking those first

00:00:33.180 --> 00:00:35.070
two questions. But the third question is:

00:00:35.070 --> 00:00:37.770
who we are not designing for? I teach my

00:00:37.770 --> 00:00:40.739
students that design is ongoing risky

00:00:40.739 --> 00:00:43.350
decision making. And what I mean by

00:00:43.350 --> 00:00:45.359
ongoing is that you never really get to

00:00:45.359 --> 00:00:48.570
stop questioning the assumptions that

00:00:48.570 --> 00:00:50.910
you're making that are underlying what

00:00:50.910 --> 00:00:51.840
it is that you're creating, those

00:00:51.840 --> 00:00:55.050
fundamental premises. Things change, you

00:00:55.050 --> 00:00:58.890
change, the market changes and you have

00:00:58.890 --> 00:01:00.749
to like have as part of your practice

00:01:00.749 --> 00:01:04.320
an ongoing process of revisiting those

00:01:04.320 --> 00:01:06.689
fundamental assumptions. So in the

00:01:06.689 --> 00:01:07.860
academic community we have these

00:01:07.860 --> 00:01:09.720
rigorous standards for the ethical

00:01:09.720 --> 00:01:11.250
reviews that we must go through before

00:01:11.250 --> 00:01:14.430
we publish, before we even undertake

00:01:14.430 --> 00:01:18.210
research that we might publish. An

00:01:18.210 --> 00:01:20.009
example of that

00:01:20.009 --> 00:01:22.200
so if you look at like that you might

00:01:22.200 --> 00:01:24.270
have seen Facebook's emotional contagion

00:01:24.270 --> 00:01:27.780
study. And they came under a lot of

00:01:27.780 --> 00:01:30.210
criticism when people realized that they

00:01:30.210 --> 00:01:33.780
were manipulating the sort of emotional

00:01:33.780 --> 00:01:37.380
emotional tenor of people's feeds. And

00:01:37.380 --> 00:01:39.810
that is an example of a study that would

00:01:39.810 --> 00:01:43.680
have never passed academic ethical

00:01:43.680 --> 00:01:45.899
review boards. And what's really

00:01:45.899 --> 00:01:48.119
interesting is that in this professional

00:01:48.119 --> 00:01:50.159
population, the academic population, we've

00:01:50.159 --> 00:01:54.180
decided on a value system in terms of

00:01:54.180 --> 00:01:57.719
what is ethical to do to people who are

00:01:57.719 --> 00:01:59.909
active participants in the study, and

00:01:59.909 --> 00:02:02.009
people who are passive participants or

00:02:02.009 --> 00:02:04.020
non-participants of the study.

00:02:04.020 --> 00:02:07.859
And in business, and particularly in the

00:02:07.859 --> 00:02:11.099
tech community, there's a notable absence

00:02:11.099 --> 00:02:15.540
of a similar review system And these

00:02:15.540 --> 00:02:18.300
types of decisions of who we designed

00:02:18.300 --> 00:02:20.760
for and who we don't design for; these

00:02:20.760 --> 00:02:24.330
are ultimately values decisions.

00:02:24.330 --> 00:02:26.099
They're very messy, like there's no answer

00:02:26.099 --> 00:02:28.650
about who we should and should not

00:02:28.650 --> 00:02:32.010
design for. The answer is to continue to

00:02:32.010 --> 00:02:35.910
have that dialogue and continue to have

00:02:35.910 --> 00:02:38.760
the basic information that we need to

00:02:38.760 --> 00:02:44.610
have that dialogue, for designers to have that dialogue, for funders to be part

00:02:44.610 --> 00:02:48.150
of that dialogue, for you know young

00:02:48.150 --> 00:02:51.150
students fresh out of school deciding

00:02:51.150 --> 00:02:53.130
who to work for to be able to have that

00:02:53.130 --> 00:02:55.380
dialogue, for consumers to be able to

00:02:55.380 --> 00:02:59.069
have that dialogue about what

00:02:59.069 --> 00:03:01.470
value systems they want to support with

00:03:01.470 --> 00:03:04.650
their business. We need that

00:03:04.650 --> 00:03:08.220
continuous ongoing questioning of

00:03:08.220 --> 00:03:22.770
design assumptions and decisions.
