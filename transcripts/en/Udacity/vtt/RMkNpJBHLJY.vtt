00:00:00.420 --> 00:00:04.870
Okay we're down to the final idea in
our acronym, which is the letter S for

00:00:04.870 --> 00:00:06.460
Style consistently.

00:00:06.460 --> 00:00:09.080
Now, the thing to
understand about this idea

00:00:09.080 --> 00:00:12.630
is that it does not matter which
style guide a student decides to use

00:00:12.630 --> 00:00:16.930
as long as they are consistent with the
styles they use throughout their code.

00:00:16.930 --> 00:00:20.860
This means that if the student is using
the Google Python style guide and

00:00:20.860 --> 00:00:25.000
are defining a class in this manner
where the first letter of each word is

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:29.720
capitalized, they should follow that
same guide throughout their code and not

00:00:29.720 --> 00:00:34.860
do something like this, where the first
letter of each word is not capitalized.

00:00:34.860 --> 00:00:38.610
What matters here is consistency
throughout the code.

00:00:38.610 --> 00:00:40.090
Let's look at another example of this.
