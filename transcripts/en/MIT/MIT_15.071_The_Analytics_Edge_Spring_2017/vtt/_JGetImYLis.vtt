00:00:04.530 --> 00:00:07.810
Let's conclude with a word about
the status of predictive coding

00:00:07.810 --> 00:00:09.600
today.

00:00:09.600 --> 00:00:13.250
In legal systems, it's difficult
to change existing practice

00:00:13.250 --> 00:00:16.450
because of laws reliant
on past precedent, which

00:00:16.450 --> 00:00:20.850
causes current decisions to be
made on the basis of past ones.

00:00:20.850 --> 00:00:23.920
Because the types of
eDiscovery admissible in court

00:00:23.920 --> 00:00:27.070
have historically been limited
to keyword search coupled

00:00:27.070 --> 00:00:29.810
with manual review,
nearly all cases

00:00:29.810 --> 00:00:32.950
today use this
eDiscovery approach.

00:00:32.950 --> 00:00:36.610
However, this status quo seems
to be starting to change.

00:00:36.610 --> 00:00:40.540
In 2012, a US District Court
ruled that predictive coding

00:00:40.540 --> 00:00:43.060
was a legitimate
eDiscovery tool, which

00:00:43.060 --> 00:00:47.750
may pave the way for its
expanded use in coming years.
