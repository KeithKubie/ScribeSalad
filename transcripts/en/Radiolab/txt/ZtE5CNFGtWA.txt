Speaker 1:          00:00          Are we good? I think we are. Maybe you have to get in closer. Yeah. Okay. All right. Yup. We should do the thing. I'm Jad Abumrad. I'm Robert Krulwich, Radiolab, the podcast. Can you just tell us who you are? Oh, uh, well, I don't believe I'm going to reveal that and we're gonna start today's podcast with this international man of mystery. Who are you reading? No. Uh, I'm Ian Frazier. Ian is a writer for the New Yorker magazine and he's written a bunch of wonderful books. I Wilson Siberia and other books of nonfiction and humor. And we had Ian come to visit us because we were working together on a show about games, which we just aired in that show. We ended up talking about a baseball, a football, basketball, checkers, chess. But the says there was a game that we totally ignored. Tic tacs. Tic-Tac-Toe. All right. So what's the deal with you and Tic Tac toe? I mean, you, you learned it at age five, I'm assuming, like

Speaker 2:          01:00          buddy. Exactly. Like everybody else. Yeah, of course. But I mean, as you get older, it's one of the first sort of levels of sophistication that you reach is that you know how to get a draw on every tic-tac-toe game and you learn that at about age, maybe six I would say. And after that it's just formality. It's sort of a developmental milestone. Gaming. It is. It is. But when you realize you have to be sophisticatedly bored the game, right. And you go, Oh yes, I'm very good at that. So you, you each the mature age of six and achieved a certain amount of tic-tac-toe. Sophisticated. I would say I was a grandmaster.

Speaker 1:          01:35          Yeah. But the problem is when you get to that grand master point, everybody else is a grandmaster too. And so everything is a draw and the game basically dies. Right. And so like the rest of us, Ian stopped playing tic-tac-toe. But then when he was well into his middle life, you might say, oh, this would have been in, this would have been about 10 years ago. He ran into something that made him think, well, maybe tic-tac-toe can still do something for me. Right, right. What happened?

Speaker 2:          02:04          Well, I went to Russia and I traveled, uh, all over. And uh, I was in, uh, Chikota, which is the part of, uh, the Russian Far East, opposite, uh, Alaska. It's not a great distance, but it's an enormous distance in terms of culture. Uh, and at that time my Russian language was very weak and I was staying with this, uh, a young couple who had a six year old son named eager. And because of the level of my language, I got along very well with preschool children and elementary school teachers. Hello. I am a student. Right. And that didn't seem like ridiculous to a six year old. It seemed great. And he actually could speak some English. He had like about eight or 10 words. And the first thing eager said to me was,

Speaker 1:          02:55          how do you do?

Speaker 2:          03:01          He was just incredibly cute and the nice kid and his shirts, you know, red Russian kids shirts are buttoned up at the neck like that. And he was very, very serious. And, and, and so we were just hanging out and I was able to talk to him. And then on a whim, really he said, I said, well let's, let's play tic Tac toe and why did you get that idea? Yeah, cause it was just something to do with the kid. I don't even remember how we got that idea, but we were just sitting around and I explained the game to him and he had never heard of it. Really? So you drew, you drew the classic shape of the tick tech to this boy and he stares it into, so what's this like some kind of cross or what he did, he didn't know what it was.

Speaker 2:          03:39          He had no idea what it was. And I just showed him by drawing how you do this x's and o's. And he picked it up. I mean he understood what it was. And then we started playing and he very quickly got the principal, but I, to be honest, was clobbering him with doing, was there a certain kind of joy? It's just like, ah, that's not where the o goes. And then three x's foul, you're outta here and he would be quite crushed. I'm like, oh no, I lost it. But it's really fun to play tic Tac toe with someone who doesn't know how, because you're just walking all over him and just putting axes. And I was, it was okay. Technically it was not fair. I think finally we're collaborating. Are you talking like, oh, I mean James or game after game. And it didn't take very many moves for me to win. So I stayed with them before we made this trip into the Tundra and we went out into the Tundra. We were there for a week or 10 days or something. And then I came back and stayed with them again. I do not believe he had been playing tic TAC toe in my absence, but somehow he had gotten better.

Speaker 2:          04:54          And so we had very, very ordinary and frustrating games in my, for my point of view as became back. I didn't win as readily at all. I didn't lose well. But, uh, you feel a slight urge to go to the nearby school, find new, find new weather. Uh, Siberian tic-tac-toe Hustler was how in elementary schools, of course was how I, you know, paid for for several years have paid for my New York City apartment. Uh, I later checked and, uh, listeners may contradict me, but as far as I know, this game is unknown in Russia and I've asked Russian friends, unknown, completely unknown, complete like years old and up and up. I would send in eastern Russia on the site in deep Siberian or I was in deep Siberia. But, um, uh, in the cities, I have not met anybody who knows this. Moscow, you want a Straw skull? Not a Moscow. I've

Speaker 1:          05:58          asked people, I didn't go around these cities and say, do you know tic-tac-toe? I mean, what if it didn't get to a Minsk? Wha what is, so finish that sentence. How, how wide is the shadow of non tictactoe dumb. If we can establish this in eastern Russia, maybe, maybe you could go to Japan and they wouldn't know how to play it. I haven't even, I don't know. Well, it would be interesting just to find out where tictactoe is elsewhere and where it isn't. Yeah. Not that I'm going to do it myself. No, no, no. It's to be one of these. This could be one of these crowdsourcing opportunities. Why is that? Well, we can ask people to help map it for us because like what if there are whole corners of the globe that are virginal territory. So you could go to playgrounds and you could like walk in and say, Hey, kids wish them come here.

Speaker 1:          06:44          So we decided to test this proposition. After we talked to Ian, we put a call on our Facebook page asking for you people to help us make map. And we got [inaudible] bosses. Hello. I am coming to you from Kwangju, South Korea. Actually lots in the north of Iran near the Caspian Sea. Croatia hills, not in Poland, Istanbul, Turkey, Christchurch, New Zealand. I'm here in Seattle, Washington or Cedric ground. The Netherlands, Argentina, Caribbean, Namibia, Japan, Dublin, Ireland. Gotcha. In the fall, who's Denmark? Okay. A typically hot day here in Dubai and stretches are pretty simple. Grab a cell phone or whatever you got that can record. Go out. No, let's get on with our business. Take a survey. So I think we found our first victim. Who Nice people walking by in the full show. Miss you. Principal Movie Paul. Oh, hello sir. Have you heard of [inaudible] a a game called tic-tac-toe backhoe. We LMU moving their own doctor. Who here has ever heard of the game? Ticktack to tech toe kick tech. So here are the results, which may surprise you will go country by country. Everybody interviewed a lot of people. So what you will hear is representative and we'll start with Japan.

Speaker 3:          07:58          Do you know Tic Tac toe? Tic Tac toe? No. This game? No. No. No.

Speaker 1:          08:06          Japan? No. No. No. Argentina. No. It doesn't. No. No. Ireland. No. Do you know what it is or no one knows how to play Tic Tac toe? No. Maybe. Yeah. Yes sir. Nope. No. Switzerland. No. Turkey. No. Croatia. No New Zealand pick tags. Is it a dance? Now it's again. Have you so you've never played tic-tac-toe. Heavens no. No. You're on sir. It is [inaudible] so amazingly, it seemed like huge chunks of the globe. Do not know tic-tac-toe. Tictactoe hustler could clean up the key or forget hustling. Maybe you just want to believe there are still some blank spots left in the globe. We'll hear yard, yes, but just to be safe, we asked everybody to go out, not just with their cell phones, but with a pen and a paper so that when someone says no, they could draw them the grid just to be certain. Let me show you. Okay. We have x's and we have owes and things like this, this or this. So if I am ex and then that a stereotype, try to stop me and you have to get three in a row and this is when the answers change. That's awesome. Oh, so ex, Huh? Findex. Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. Well you know that, Huh?

Speaker 1:          09:35          Once people saw the grid with the x's and o's, they were like, oh yeah, we know that game. Of course, we just don't call it tic-tac-toe game has a different name in Turkish. Yes, in Turkish. It's called peace. All X, x or x in Serbia, x socks, socks, socks. Gosh. What's the name in Peru? Peru. It's Meechie in South Korea. What do you call it? Almost one more homo and in England, which one is it called? Goats and crosses, looks and crawfish knots and crosses, which is also what they call it in Ireland. And we call it noughts and crosses New Zealand now in Switzerland [inaudible] it's known. And the French language, that is what they call it in Polish. PUCO [inaudible] it's cuco extra jet. Is everybody in Poland know how to play this? Yeah. And to round things out in Argentina they call it that. The D in The Netherlands. Both kinds. And I use them Iran, no corner Croatia. And in Costa Rica. Gotcha. Gotcha.

Speaker 4:          10:32          Well let's take a little break and look at our notes. See where we stand so far,

Speaker 1:          10:37          gentlemen, I'm beginning to get this feeling. Seven people interviewed seven new, it had our dream was of glory.

Speaker 4:          10:43          I'll know what take the pill is.

Speaker 1:          10:45          Yeah. We were going to, you know, we were going to be the Gingiss cons of tic-tac-toe just may not be supported by the data.

Speaker 5:          10:55          No. Yeah,

Speaker 1:          11:01          but we got Russia, right?

Speaker 5:          11:06          [inaudible]

Speaker 1:          11:07          well, um, hi, you infringer. Hi, this is Soren and I work with rob. I don't know if we have Russia actually, because as we were conducting our international tic-tac-toe survey, I got a note from Ian. It was a, it was a, it looked like an [inaudible] note. So I called him up and he told me that shortly after we talked to him that first time,

Speaker 6:          11:26          it was maybe even the same day,

Speaker 1:          11:27          he was at a party and there were some Russians.

Speaker 6:          11:30          And I just thought, okay, let me just make sure about this. And I asked and they said, yes, of course there's tic-tac-toe. And I said, wow, everybody told me. And they said, yeah, sure, everybody knows it. A friend even told me the name of it, it's Kresky Norske, which is like processes and zero. And he said, yeah, it's well known. And the entire thing fell to the ground at that point. Um, my, my dream of Tic Tac toe conquest, so sorry, I don't, I'm sorry. I base this on insufficient data. And a, I'd say completely wrong, completely wrong, because I did encounter, you know, some people who didn't know, and this one kid who I really, I can promise you I just beat the pants off of, uh, in tic-tac-toe. He had no idea, but that was my, the limit of my contacts

Speaker 1:          12:24          last time. We got take tax. So we got [inaudible] tape. Ian Frazier is the author of travels in Siberia and Paul, bunch of wonderful books.
