00:00:05.910 --> 00:00:12.700
 Ikegawa Reiko First, I gave you this opportunity 

00:00:10.139 --> 00:00:14.170
 Thank you to Columbia University 

00:00:12.700 --> 00:00:15.030
 Yup 

00:00:14.170 --> 00:00:18.199
 I 

00:00:15.030 --> 00:00:22.770
 The focus of this presentation is 

00:00:18.199 --> 00:00:27.760
 Produced by the Manchuria Film Association in 1943 

00:00:22.770 --> 00:00:34.010
 It is a short movie called Hanayame of Aizawa 

00:00:27.760 --> 00:00:37.280
 The film was discovered about 40 years ago from a certain RIKEN farmer 

00:00:34.010 --> 00:00:43.280
 Manchuk immigrant wife with young woman 

00:00:37.280 --> 00:00:50.079
 That is propaganda Iga to be invited to Manchuria as a continental bride 

00:00:43.280 --> 00:00:50.079
 Untitled is the first female movie director in Japan 

00:01:29.770 --> 00:01:40.780
 Since the movie was imported to Japan 2 minutes at the end of the 19th century 

00:01:34.240 --> 00:01:45.549
 Developed along with the imperialistic expansion and by the end of the 1930s 

00:01:40.780 --> 00:01:50.510
 It came to be regarded as a propaganda for the execution of a total war 

00:01:45.549 --> 00:01:55.430
 And propaganda using the film is not only the first place 

00:01:50.510 --> 00:02:00.100
 It is said that it is occupied area in Taiwan Korea China mainland south coast 

00:01:55.430 --> 00:02:03.189
 Beige of elements of the Greater East Asia Co-prosperity zone concept 

00:02:00.100 --> 00:02:08.619
 Above all, it was made in northeastern China 

00:02:03.189 --> 00:02:14.920
傀儡 National Mercy Here was established here in the direction of the boom 

00:02:08.619 --> 00:02:19.819
 The Manchuria Film Association produced a stickman's propaganda 

00:02:14.920 --> 00:02:24.709
 Even if it changes to many leaves, Keikyu is accumulated from both Japan and China 

00:02:19.819 --> 00:02:29.890
 Makino defending is Manchuku immigration research and above all 

00:02:24.709 --> 00:02:37.200
 Man A has been defining from early on joining research 

00:02:29.890 --> 00:02:44.390
 This presentation is an attempt to respond to the reduction of the volume from a gender perspective 

00:02:37.200 --> 00:02:52.010
 What Is Manchurian Immigrants? What Louise Young was in the heart of the Great Japanese Empire 

00:02:44.390 --> 00:02:55.150
 It is defined that it was Manchukuo country I advance it and what was in the center of Manchukuo country is the continent 

00:02:52.010 --> 00:02:55.150
 Want to say she was a lovely bride 

00:02:55.350 --> 00:03:00.400
 Army and Seibu 

00:02:57.250 --> 00:03:03.700
 First of all, China's northeastern China 

00:03:00.400 --> 00:03:11.140
 Then know the character of economic development 

00:03:03.700 --> 00:03:18.310
 We carried out together and carried out Manzhou agriculture immigration business as national policy 

00:03:11.140 --> 00:03:20.700
 It was considered necessary to increase the population of the Yamato people for the lasting control of the Manchukuo colony 

00:03:18.310 --> 00:03:20.700
 Because 

00:03:23.890 --> 00:03:36.160
 Therefore we let single women migrate from Japan to Manchuria 

00:03:29.380 --> 00:03:41.820
 And I thought it would be a big problem of Hopper to let the children get married in the field 

00:03:36.160 --> 00:03:41.820
 From a polar point of view, the bride on the continent was a single military item 

00:03:41.950 --> 00:03:52.480
 Naizawa Naha says women film directors and women immigrants 

00:03:46.780 --> 00:03:59.489
 It is a movie that was established from the point of view where the female role under wartime crosses 

00:03:52.480 --> 00:04:01.940
 I read part of the role played by the film in the policy of aggressive expansion by reading this 

00:03:59.489 --> 00:04:03.940
 I would like to decipher 

00:04:01.940 --> 00:04:03.940
 Hmm 

00:04:04.720 --> 00:04:09.120
 This presentation is organized as follows: 

00:04:09.200 --> 00:04:16.540
 First, I would like to briefly describe the archive situation of the number of surveys 

00:04:17.329 --> 00:04:30.470
 What was marketed for domestic materials and then televised 

00:04:24.470 --> 00:04:36.340
 An exhaustive survey of what the film center holds 

00:04:30.470 --> 00:04:37.889
 Then it is a curl outside the country, but first of all a in China 

00:04:36.340 --> 00:04:41.370
 Chinese 

00:04:37.889 --> 00:04:44.699
 It's just a movie library 

00:04:41.370 --> 00:04:48.120
 There are a variety of lockers mentioned but here 

00:04:44.699 --> 00:04:52.430
 A million yen fool movies 108 

00:04:48.120 --> 00:04:58.090
 The 108 hours are held by Keimei 

00:04:52.430 --> 00:05:07.120
 However, it is not in the situation that foreign researchers can use now 

00:04:58.090 --> 00:05:12.580
 In recent years, works of colonial Korea came out from the Chinese Film Archive and took dvd 

00:05:07.120 --> 00:05:15.470
 What version will a work come out in the future? 

00:05:12.580 --> 00:05:18.530
 I want to watch the development 

00:05:15.470 --> 00:05:26.450
 Then the Russian goth cut is also at Phong 

00:05:18.530 --> 00:05:27.170
 The previous film held here was sold as a 30-can video product in 1994. 

00:05:26.450 --> 00:05:32.900
 Was 

00:05:27.170 --> 00:05:35.390
 This included whey made by Sakae Tazuko 

00:05:32.900 --> 00:05:38.990
 it is America 

00:05:35.390 --> 00:05:45.140
 North Sea Library and then official documents simply 

00:05:38.990 --> 00:05:47.300
 It is known that many wartime Japanese films have been launched upstream, especially 10,000 yen for excited letters 

00:05:45.140 --> 00:05:50.300
 At least 5 works 

00:05:47.300 --> 00:05:55.409
 It has been confirmed that it has been saved 

00:05:50.300 --> 00:06:00.080
 It is Britain but coal mine movie line to Imperial War Museum 

00:05:55.409 --> 00:06:03.710
 I have found that there are some of the ones made below 

00:06:00.080 --> 00:06:08.120
 Then it is a literature document and unfortunately it is 

00:06:03.710 --> 00:06:16.560
 Most of the contemporary materials of Man a are not extant 

00:06:08.120 --> 00:06:21.120
 For Manchuria reclamation immigrant materials, the white university q month related material archive was useful 

00:06:16.560 --> 00:06:27.570
 Then I listened to it and then investigated the remains of Sakane 

00:06:21.120 --> 00:06:34.860
 Fortunately, we can investigate the remains of Sakane, which the bereaved kept. 

00:06:27.570 --> 00:06:36.580
 Also to the survivors of my colleague in the tens of thousands yen who made a hearing together 

00:06:34.860 --> 00:06:38.360
 Do an interview 

00:06:36.580 --> 00:06:41.659
 doing 

00:06:38.360 --> 00:06:47.240
 Then it became location of feather 6 of aizawa 

00:06:41.659 --> 00:06:53.319
 It is a place called Saitama Village reclamation team which made 12 large pieces 

00:06:47.240 --> 00:06:53.319
 I was able to hear from those of you who survived 

00:06:53.529 --> 00:07:01.149
 Then I would like to talk about my retrograde life 

00:06:57.549 --> 00:07:04.880
 Sakane was born in Kyoto in 1904 

00:07:01.149 --> 00:07:12.080
 Are you an underground or sexual inventor? 

00:07:04.880 --> 00:07:16.680
 My parents grew up in a very rich and friendly environment for movies and plays 

00:07:12.080 --> 00:07:25.130
 Exceptionally high education at that time 

00:07:16.680 --> 00:07:25.130
 I will go to Doshisha Women's University, but I will marry a souvenir halfway but soon divorced 

00:07:25.879 --> 00:07:34.700
 1929 Sakane joins Kyoto Nikkatsu 

00:07:31.259 --> 00:07:42.160
 I was assigned under Mizoguchi Kenji no 

00:07:34.700 --> 00:07:42.160
 I entered the film world, and I actually cut hair and decided to a fault like this 

00:07:42.249 --> 00:07:49.149
 At the scene of the movie, it's perfect next to Mizoguchi 

00:07:46.059 --> 00:07:56.729
 Assistant director editing here 

00:07:49.149 --> 00:07:56.729
 I learned the job of record loneliness and scenario reworking 

00:07:57.780 --> 00:08:05.740
 1936 Sakane plays Han Chinese transmission at the 1st movie 

00:08:03.480 --> 00:08:13.270
 The title of the first appearance a 

00:08:05.740 --> 00:08:14.860
 Young and old typical example that we separate in the circumstances of the house while the young men and women love each other 

00:08:13.270 --> 00:08:20.009
 Referee tragedy 

00:08:14.860 --> 00:08:25.080
 The feelings of this time Sakane are well generated and left 

00:08:20.009 --> 00:08:31.649
 It was a very sassy thing to be a director to a woman's habit 

00:08:25.080 --> 00:08:33.500
 However, in foreign countries, already known as Dorothy art girl's uniform, a certain amount 亭 Zagan girls etc. 

00:08:31.649 --> 00:08:37.070
 Enters 

00:08:33.500 --> 00:08:43.640
 Women's scenario writers besides Japanese films 

00:08:37.070 --> 00:08:47.210
 If a woman's camera trouble gets into a formidable situation, I will draw with these staff in a man 

00:08:43.640 --> 00:08:53.050
 Not that I want to make a movie on women's edition 

00:08:47.210 --> 00:08:53.050
 However, Mizoguchi did not give the store a second chance 

00:08:53.480 --> 00:09:07.779
 Forty years Sakane has been independent from Mizoguchi and specializes in acupuncture film and joins a science-based film 

00:09:01.550 --> 00:09:11.230
 Here, Sakane was entrusted with the same plan of the Cabinet Information Division's performance plan. 

00:09:07.779 --> 00:09:14.649
 People of Ainu in the wartime system 

00:09:11.230 --> 00:09:21.699
 Is it the purpose to draw as a model? 

00:09:14.649 --> 00:09:23.520
 However, Sakane rather depicted the traditional film lunch of Ainu such as the Bear Festival 

00:09:21.699 --> 00:09:30.000
 I was careful 

00:09:23.520 --> 00:09:34.950
 The finished work is in danger of being presented by the company's this regulation, but it is in love 

00:09:30.000 --> 00:09:40.460
 We take figure of youth rise and are built in construction 

00:09:34.950 --> 00:09:48.530
 Next was Sakane's vision of a continental bride-themed movie 

00:09:40.460 --> 00:09:54.490
 My boss's Soichi Oya was also comfortable but Otani will move to the infestation in the autumn of 41, even on a slope 

00:09:48.530 --> 00:09:54.490
 At the end of the year, I moved to Man a by Otani's connection. 

00:09:55.370 --> 00:10:05.200
 The Manchuria Film Association, founded in 1937, consolidated films from Manchuria 

00:10:02.700 --> 00:10:09.840
 It is an organization with a huge bath pattern 

00:10:05.200 --> 00:10:16.840
 The director at the time of joining Sakai is Masahiko Amajima 

00:10:09.840 --> 00:10:21.510
 It is a person who is said to be involved in Karuta's trick behind the administration of Banshu country 

00:10:16.840 --> 00:10:29.330
 At that time Man A's film production division was divided into three 

00:10:21.510 --> 00:10:29.330
 Sakine, who is a dilapidated sleeper, joined as a director of type mummy 

00:10:30.630 --> 00:10:42.569
 Sakane creates works like the above with Man 3 

00:10:35.279 --> 00:10:44.440
 In terms of numbers, it is the first work of a Knights and a child with a sickness 

00:10:42.569 --> 00:10:48.819
 Thing 

00:10:44.440 --> 00:10:50.140
 Only the person who attached the old map Rushio has confirmed its existence 

00:10:48.819 --> 00:10:54.640
 This list mother is 

00:10:50.140 --> 00:11:00.420
 Sakane for Chinese Women and Children 

00:10:54.640 --> 00:11:00.420
 I can understand well that it was needed for 10,000 yen 

00:11:01.649 --> 00:11:13.959
 Sakane could not make a piece of work in a way that I thought was asked by a woman's niece 3 at any house 

00:11:09.459 --> 00:11:17.529
 Sakone is the first to enter a colonial film company 

00:11:13.959 --> 00:11:24.180
 It became possible to make a constant film 

00:11:17.529 --> 00:11:26.790
 However, it was a woman gendered one or more 

00:11:24.180 --> 00:11:35.910
 Food also looks nice 

00:11:26.790 --> 00:11:41.100
 Aizawa Naha Nabe depicts life in Manchuk Pioneer Village lightly, focusing on a couple of leading couples 

00:11:35.910 --> 00:11:45.230
 And finally it ends where the baby is born on the harvest festival 

00:11:41.100 --> 00:11:45.230
 It is a short film 20 minutes 

00:11:45.720 --> 00:11:52.410
 At first glance it looks like a documentary 

00:11:49.170 --> 00:11:57.839
 By the testimony of the survivors of the pioneer village 

00:11:52.410 --> 00:12:02.759
 Sakane gives the members a good different from reality 

00:11:57.839 --> 00:12:05.710
 It turned out that I took action and filmed it in a drama format 

00:12:02.759 --> 00:12:13.090
 I especially changed the water of the tube I took 

00:12:05.710 --> 00:12:20.100
 A lot of 4,000 single women in mainland plum blossom are shown in the film 

00:12:13.090 --> 00:12:20.100
 This is the students of Sakabe and the fireworks display of the mainland of Shinjuku 

00:12:20.600 --> 00:12:30.720
 The first feature of this film is the thinness of propaganda speed 

00:12:26.220 --> 00:12:38.250
 It was written for example on a day when a woman wore 

00:12:30.720 --> 00:12:41.950
 It is expressed in encrypted form such as the next book called Ichitokuichishin, but this can be understood 

00:12:38.250 --> 00:12:47.560
 I do not think there was a crowd 

00:12:41.950 --> 00:12:51.730
 Next is the relationship between male and female equal love 

00:12:47.560 --> 00:12:58.840
 For example, if you make a mistake 

00:12:51.730 --> 00:13:00.180
 There is a scene that the shot which gets water from the sand comes in, and then it gives it to the horse her husband brought 

00:12:58.840 --> 00:13:04.320
 Continue 

00:13:00.180 --> 00:13:08.970
 My husband drinks water from a well. 

00:13:04.320 --> 00:13:12.710
 And in the parlor where my wife chooses that and water 

00:13:08.970 --> 00:13:12.710
 Each shot will be transferred 

00:14:36.740 --> 00:14:48.790
 My fathers are extremely childish and take care of their children 

00:14:41.860 --> 00:14:50.080
 It is interesting to note that the children he brings up to seven are completely distracted from militarism 

00:14:48.790 --> 00:14:58.060
 is 

00:14:50.080 --> 00:15:04.180
 The glider that the whole house built is a man of May, and it lands on the nose with a soft nose. 

00:14:58.060 --> 00:15:08.089
 The scene etc. was an unbelievable contractor considering the real machine of 1943 

00:15:04.180 --> 00:15:13.560
 Why in the film world at that time? 

00:15:08.089 --> 00:15:20.279
 Because the glider was the attribute of the English black boy 

00:15:13.560 --> 00:15:23.690
 When I liked this scene for a movie, Sakane incorporated the image of a good Hansen into the movie 

00:15:20.279 --> 00:15:23.690
 I can say that I was determined 

00:15:34.040 --> 00:15:36.790
 Ah ah ah 

00:16:15.510 --> 00:16:25.590
 Lastly, it's a questionable system 

00:16:18.810 --> 00:16:27.690
 Gender equality makes the family's way and load possible rooms that can be used to ensure childcare safety too 

00:16:25.590 --> 00:16:35.500
 It is common use of life 

00:16:27.690 --> 00:16:40.560
 In the movie, the co-cooking co-career nurse's nurse seeks to finish the care with the child 

00:16:35.500 --> 00:16:48.330
 U-no processing and durability are done 

00:16:40.560 --> 00:16:51.260
 As a result, Manchuria's reclaimed land is drawn out as a man-actor ward-like utopia with a life-long peace of mind 

00:16:48.330 --> 00:16:51.260
 It became 

00:16:54.259 --> 00:17:07.539
 We will move to the examination of this slow and gradual relationship with pioneering and Manchurian immigration policy 

00:16:59.630 --> 00:17:15.279
 There was actually a harsh scene in the production background of the film depicting utopia in this way 

00:17:07.539 --> 00:17:20.709
 First of all, Manchukuo itself Manchukuo itself is positioned as a vocational base for the implementation of the Pacific War 

00:17:15.279 --> 00:17:23.799
 Flower buds will be chased by farming work to increase production 

00:17:20.709 --> 00:17:27.110
 Naturally the care of the child becomes thin 

00:17:23.799 --> 00:17:30.419
 Second mortality rate increases 

00:17:27.110 --> 00:17:35.090
 Further medical e + tree can not catch up 

00:17:30.419 --> 00:17:41.990
 Abnormal pregnancy delivery rate was extremely high 

00:17:35.090 --> 00:17:43.730
 The contradiction between the general mobilization system and the secondary insurance bond will be expressed as such clear data 

00:17:41.990 --> 00:17:47.670
 For the first time 

00:17:43.730 --> 00:17:52.530
 The measure is finally taken out from the administration 

00:17:47.670 --> 00:17:56.100
 Goat and milk talent seek for breast milk shortage measures 

00:17:52.530 --> 00:17:58.340
 Joint figures and day care establishments during the farming season 

00:17:56.100 --> 00:17:59.800
 It is insurance deployment etc. 

00:17:58.340 --> 00:18:04.870
 And 

00:17:59.800 --> 00:18:12.670
 All these were drawn into the nose and eyes of Aizawa 

00:18:04.870 --> 00:18:18.150
 But co-cooking grounds and co-nursing schools were not in the game Saitama Village. 

00:18:12.670 --> 00:18:25.470
 These facilities written were Yarase submitted 

00:18:18.150 --> 00:18:27.590
 That is, Man a works with the immigrants in this Baba movie for the florist in the continent 

00:18:25.470 --> 00:18:34.460
 We plan production 

00:18:27.590 --> 00:18:39.770
 A lot of infrastructure that has not been realized yet had to be drawn in there 

00:18:34.460 --> 00:18:42.530
 And as a director, he originally longed for the continent Naha dam theme 

00:18:39.770 --> 00:18:52.840
 That is why my reverse eye was rested 

00:18:42.530 --> 00:18:52.840
 Conversely, the ability of female immigrants to advance and regress is the key to making the women director's own desire for decay 

00:18:53.140 --> 00:19:02.179
 The situation where it is abused to the fullest to carry out the war 

00:18:57.790 --> 00:19:09.740
 I had to wait for the emergence of the situation 

00:19:02.179 --> 00:19:16.930
 The uniqueness of Sakone can be clearly understood by comparing it with a manchurian film created at the same time 

00:19:09.740 --> 00:19:18.480
 Japanese films have a national and popular desire for the vast area of ​​Manchuria 

00:19:16.930 --> 00:19:24.840
 long 

00:19:18.480 --> 00:19:27.820
 It was the media that I drew, of course the center of the film was militarized 

00:19:24.840 --> 00:19:32.950
 It was occupied by a male image 

00:19:27.820 --> 00:19:37.789
 In other words, underground video of housework child care drawn by Sakane 

00:19:32.950 --> 00:19:42.350
 And the male image that was completely separated from the war 

00:19:37.789 --> 00:19:46.190
 Both public measures in the reclamation area and the war model 

00:19:42.350 --> 00:19:49.950
 It was also separated from the gender norms required by the war system 

00:19:46.190 --> 00:19:55.200
 It was the image of Orizara Sakane 

00:19:49.950 --> 00:19:57.650
 At the end of Aizawa's flowers and fruits, they buy a horse and take off the fans 

00:19:55.200 --> 00:20:05.420
 The appearance of samba appears 

00:19:57.650 --> 00:20:09.820
 A boy corps made under the wartime is proud of Mitsuda with more achievements in the movie 

00:20:05.420 --> 00:20:14.140
 Finding a real female image is a good thing 

00:20:09.820 --> 00:20:20.080
 Now there were three birds in the Saitama Village Appraisal Countermeasures Team 

00:20:14.140 --> 00:20:21.600
 However SAKANE chooses another young woman without using her and with Japanese yen 

00:20:20.080 --> 00:20:27.320
 Put on a horse 

00:20:21.600 --> 00:20:27.320
 Because she was the only woman who made horseback riding better 

00:20:48.130 --> 00:21:04.809
 It is the second of the adventures in which the bereaved is overrun and the Japanese boy plays an active part without red sunset in a sense Manchu 

00:20:58.180 --> 00:21:10.770
 It was also a strong counter for the colonial film pair that had been 

00:21:04.809 --> 00:21:15.480
 But again, so much to visualize the relationship between the buff sugar movie and the woman 

00:21:10.770 --> 00:21:21.960
 There is no image The first thing she runs through 

00:21:15.480 --> 00:21:26.970
 It is nothing less than what I took away from here that Japanese life is born and dropped 

00:21:21.960 --> 00:21:29.190
 The rule of the country meant to be an image nation 

00:21:26.970 --> 00:21:36.300
 It is a conclusion 

00:21:29.190 --> 00:21:42.120
 Sakone slipped through the wall with women's discrimination and wartime film control 

00:21:36.300 --> 00:21:46.840
 Man A became a female director in putting himself in a colonial propaganda organization 

00:21:42.120 --> 00:21:53.380
 She was able to continue to be a filmmaker 

00:21:46.840 --> 00:21:54.909
 Perhaps Sakane has all the criticisms of the fascism and colonialism 

00:21:53.380 --> 00:21:59.229
 did not 

00:21:54.909 --> 00:22:06.060
 The target of Sakane's resistance penetrates the Japanese film world 

00:21:59.229 --> 00:22:13.920
 I was limited to the second generation central and militant values ​​there 

00:22:06.060 --> 00:22:21.800
 In order to create a world of works that is completely different from the male director, Sakane 

00:22:13.920 --> 00:22:21.800
 The trace of the ability to shake down the waterfall is clearly marked 

00:22:22.220 --> 00:22:30.250
 There is also a movie related to Manchu immigrants that even other wartime lower Japanese films never make 

00:22:29.030 --> 00:22:35.140
 It was not 

00:22:30.250 --> 00:22:39.070
 Peaceful, full of life and influenced by gender 

00:22:35.140 --> 00:22:44.350
 A male image and a female image are active 

00:22:39.070 --> 00:22:49.059
 The royal road music soil to the slogan of Mark Manchukuo countries such as the Five-City Kyowa 

00:22:44.350 --> 00:22:55.399
 Add only one idiom of gender equality 

00:22:49.059 --> 00:23:01.880
 The aim that high sound aimed at in the flower buds of measures can be agreed as such 

00:22:55.399 --> 00:23:08.690
 But it was a complete castle with other slogans 

00:23:01.880 --> 00:23:10.360
 There are few screening records of Aizawa's flower picture dream, and this film has affected how immigrant mobilization 

00:23:08.690 --> 00:23:18.280
 I do not know 

00:23:10.360 --> 00:23:19.600
 However, activities in the spread of Sakane, not limited to the nose and eyes of pioneering, can not escape historical criticism 

00:23:18.280 --> 00:23:25.799
 can not 

00:23:19.600 --> 00:23:32.700
 It would be a pleasure to give my own answer to the first proposal to protect Makino 

00:23:25.799 --> 00:23:36.160
 Sakane is a field that is unexpected for male coaches who shake pens in Manchukuo 

00:23:32.700 --> 00:23:41.410
 It played a part in the imperial aggression 

00:23:36.160 --> 00:23:43.650
 Please look at the book which seems to be no further consideration Thank you for your attention 

00:23:41.410 --> 00:23:43.650
 Yes
