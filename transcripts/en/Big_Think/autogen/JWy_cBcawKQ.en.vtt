discovered when people want more flow in

00:00:03.830 --> 00:00:03.840

their lives the number one thing we can

00:00:05.570 --> 00:00:05.580
their lives the number one thing we can
 

00:00:05.580 --> 00:00:08.059
their lives the number one thing we can
tell them is that there is a flow cycle

00:00:08.059 --> 00:00:08.069
tell them is that there is a flow cycle

so the old idea about flow was there was

00:00:10.520 --> 00:00:10.530

underpin the flow state as well you're

underpin the flow state as well you're
 

00:02:24.840 --> 00:02:27.080
underpin the flow state as well you're
in the flow state itself this is the

00:02:27.080 --> 00:02:27.090
in the flow state itself this is the
 

00:02:27.090 --> 00:02:28.430
in the flow state itself this is the
third stage of the struggle and on the

00:02:28.430 --> 00:02:28.440
third stage of the struggle and on the
 

00:02:28.440 --> 00:02:30.950
third stage of the struggle and on the
back end of the flow state there is

00:02:30.950 --> 00:02:30.960
back end of the flow state there is
 

00:02:30.960 --> 00:02:32.780
back end of the flow state there is
actually a recovery phase and this is

00:02:32.780 --> 00:02:32.790
actually a recovery phase and this is
 

00:02:32.790 --> 00:02:34.700
actually a recovery phase and this is
really really really critical so you go

00:02:34.700 --> 00:02:34.710
really really really critical so you go
 

00:02:34.710 --> 00:02:37.490
really really really critical so you go
from this amazing high flow to a very

flow state is actually very very

00:02:52.400 --> 00:02:52.410
flow state is actually very very
 

00:02:52.410 --> 00:02:54.860
flow state is actually very very
unpleasant as well and if you really

00:02:54.860 --> 00:02:54.870
unpleasant as well and if you really
 

00:02:54.870 --> 00:02:56.750
unpleasant as well and if you really
want to hack flow you need to learn how

00:02:56.750 --> 00:02:56.760
want to hack flow you need to learn how
 

00:02:56.760 --> 00:02:58.190
want to hack flow you need to learn how
to struggle better and you need how to

00:02:58.190 --> 00:02:58.200
to struggle better and you need how to
 

00:02:58.200 --> 00:03:00.200
to struggle better and you need how to
learn how to recover better and one of

learn how to recover better and one of
 

00:03:00.210 --> 00:03:02.240
learn how to recover better and one of
the most important things in recovery is

00:03:02.240 --> 00:03:02.250
the most important things in recovery is
