00:00:00.380 --> 00:00:03.160
So the answe to this question is the last

00:00:03.160 --> 00:00:06.825
three answers, all of them. Now why is that?

00:00:06.825 --> 00:00:07.090
[UNKNOWN],

00:00:07.090 --> 00:00:09.630
the first answer says there's no genetic component at

00:00:09.630 --> 00:00:12.440
all. We just saw in of the previous exercises

00:00:12.440 --> 00:00:15.920
that there is a concordance rate between Monozygotic twins

00:00:15.920 --> 00:00:19.860
indicating a genetic component. Just because we didn't find anything

00:00:19.860 --> 00:00:21.980
in the study. Doesn't actually mean there's not a

00:00:21.980 --> 00:00:25.850
genetic component. It could be that there's so many alleles.

00:00:25.850 --> 00:00:29.760
With each individual allele having a very small effect

00:00:29.760 --> 00:00:32.850
that we need even bigger studies more than just thousands.

00:00:32.850 --> 00:00:35.000
Maybe tens of thousands or hundreds of thousands of

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:37.700
people for us to identify the alleles that have the

00:00:37.700 --> 00:00:40.395
effect. We could also be looking at the wrong

00:00:40.395 --> 00:00:43.080
variations. Perhaps we need more SNV's to look at or

00:00:43.080 --> 00:00:45.280
maybe that there are bigger mutations we need to

00:00:45.280 --> 00:00:48.040
focus on like chromosomal translocations

00:00:48.040 --> 00:00:50.680
or gene duplications, deletions, insertions.

00:00:50.680 --> 00:00:53.730
These are detectable by just looking at single nucleotide

00:00:53.730 --> 00:00:58.000
changes. And there could always be more complicated hereditary processes,

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:00.790
hiding simple genetic effects. If there's anything

00:01:00.790 --> 00:01:02.670
this lesson has taught you. I hope it's

00:01:02.670 --> 00:01:06.690
a, there are many traits that are complex and they don't fit our simple rules

00:01:06.690 --> 00:01:09.200
of dominant and recessive. And while this

00:01:09.200 --> 00:01:11.320
can make it really difficult to understand or

00:01:11.320 --> 00:01:14.420
follow, it's what gives us all the beautiful

00:01:14.420 --> 00:01:16.800
uniqueness of each human being on the planet.
