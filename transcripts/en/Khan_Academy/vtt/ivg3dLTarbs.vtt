00:00:00.467 --> 00:00:02.191
Let's say we are operating...

00:00:02.191 --> 00:00:03.943
...in three dimensions.

00:00:03.943 --> 00:00:05.960
And I have a function, rho,

00:00:05.960 --> 00:00:08.192
...which is a function of (x,y,z)...

00:00:08.192 --> 00:00:10.255
...and it gives us the mass density...

00:00:10.255 --> 00:00:11.944
...at any point in three dimensions,

00:00:11.944 --> 00:00:13.050
...of some fluid.

00:00:13.050 --> 00:00:14.201
Some particular fluid.

00:00:14.201 --> 00:00:15.548
Maybe it's a gas, or a fluid,

00:00:15.548 --> 00:00:16.659
...water. Who knows what it is?

00:00:16.659 --> 00:00:18.210
Some type of substance.

00:00:18.210 --> 00:00:19.486
It gives us the mass density...

00:00:19.486 --> 00:00:21.385
...at any point in three dimensions.

00:00:21.385 --> 00:00:22.952
And let's say we have another...

00:00:22.952 --> 00:00:24.559
...function. This is a scalar function.

00:00:24.559 --> 00:00:25.776
It just gives us a number...

00:00:25.776 --> 00:00:27.282
...for any point in 3D.

00:00:27.282 --> 00:00:29.213
And then, let's say we have another function, v,

00:00:29.213 --> 00:00:30.676
...which is a vector function.

00:00:30.676 --> 00:00:32.069
It gives us a vector...

00:00:32.069 --> 00:00:33.831
...for any point in three dimensions.

00:00:33.831 --> 00:00:35.211
And this right over here tells us...

00:00:35.211 --> 00:00:37.322
...the velocity of that same...

00:00:37.322 --> 00:00:40.370
...the velocity of that same fluid or gas...

00:00:40.370 --> 00:00:42.128
...or whatever we're talking about.

00:00:42.128 --> 00:00:43.726
Now let's imagine another function.

00:00:43.726 --> 00:00:45.544
And this might all look a little bit familiar, because we did it...

00:00:45.544 --> 00:00:47.013
We went through a very similar exercise...

00:00:47.013 --> 00:00:49.226
...in two dimensions when we talked about line integrals.

00:00:49.226 --> 00:00:51.705
Now we're just extending it to three dimensions.

00:00:51.705 --> 00:00:53.411
Let's say we have a function, f.

00:00:54.119 --> 00:00:55.361
Let's say we have a function, f,

00:00:55.361 --> 00:00:57.181
...and it is equal to...

00:00:57.181 --> 00:00:58.292
...the product...

00:00:58.292 --> 00:01:00.739
...the product of rho and v.

00:01:00.739 --> 00:01:02.627
So for any point in (x,y,z)...

00:01:02.627 --> 00:01:04.167
...this will give us a vector, and then...

00:01:04.167 --> 00:01:06.666
...we'll multiply it times this scalar right over here...

00:01:06.666 --> 00:01:08.910
...for that same point in three dimensions.

00:01:08.910 --> 00:01:10.445
So it's equal to...

00:01:10.445 --> 00:01:13.055
...rho times v.

00:01:16.163 --> 00:01:17.494
Let me use the same color...

00:01:17.494 --> 00:01:19.189
...that I used for v before.

00:01:25.051 --> 00:01:27.369
And there's a couple of ways you could conceptualize this,

00:01:27.369 --> 00:01:28.441
...so you could view this as...

00:01:28.441 --> 00:01:30.845
Obviously it maintains the direction of the velocity,

00:01:30.845 --> 00:01:32.746
...but now its magnitude...

00:01:32.746 --> 00:01:33.759
One way to think about it is...

00:01:33.759 --> 00:01:35.360
...kind of the momentum density.

00:01:35.360 --> 00:01:36.514
And if that doesn't make too much sense,

00:01:36.514 --> 00:01:38.176
...you don't have to worry too much about it.

00:01:38.176 --> 00:01:40.189
Hopefully, as we use these two functions,

00:01:40.189 --> 00:01:41.662
...and we talk-- think a little bit more...

00:01:41.662 --> 00:01:42.829
...about them relative to a surface,

00:01:42.829 --> 00:01:45.522
...it'll make a little bit more conceptual sense.

00:01:45.522 --> 00:01:47.040
Now, what I want to do...

00:01:47.040 --> 00:01:48.907
...is think about what it means...

00:01:48.907 --> 00:01:50.007
...what it means...

00:01:50.007 --> 00:01:51.242
...given this function, f,

00:01:51.242 --> 00:01:54.191
...to evaluate the surface integral...

00:01:54.191 --> 00:01:56.104
...over some surface...

00:01:56.104 --> 00:01:57.823
So we're going to evaluate over some surface.

00:01:57.823 --> 00:02:00.129
We're going to evaluate f...

00:02:00.129 --> 00:02:04.403
We're going to evaluate f dot n,

00:02:04.403 --> 00:02:07.194
...where n is the unit normal vector at every--

00:02:07.194 --> 00:02:08.561
...at each point on that surface,

00:02:08.561 --> 00:02:11.786
...dS.

00:02:11.786 --> 00:02:12.829
d-surface.

00:02:12.829 --> 00:02:14.981
So let's think about what this is saying.

00:02:15.381 --> 00:02:18.216
So first, let me draw my axes.

00:02:18.216 --> 00:02:21.621
So I have my z-axis.

00:02:21.621 --> 00:02:23.085
z-axis...

00:02:23.085 --> 00:02:24.409
This could be my...

00:02:24.409 --> 00:02:25.650
Let's make that...

00:02:25.650 --> 00:02:27.707
Let's make that my x-axis.

00:02:27.707 --> 00:02:29.637
And let's say that this right over here...

00:02:29.637 --> 00:02:31.654
...is my y-axis.

00:02:31.654 --> 00:02:33.124
And let's say my surface...

00:02:33.124 --> 00:02:34.047
...I'll use that same color...

00:02:34.047 --> 00:02:36.422
My surface looks something like that.

00:02:36.422 --> 00:02:39.135
So that is my surface.

00:02:39.135 --> 00:02:41.904
That is the surface in question.

00:02:41.904 --> 00:02:43.526
That is S.

00:02:43.526 --> 00:02:44.838
Now let's think about the units,

00:02:44.838 --> 00:02:46.551
...and hopefully that'll give us conceptual understanding...

00:02:46.551 --> 00:02:48.869
...of what this thing right over here is measuring.

00:02:48.869 --> 00:02:50.094
It's completely analogous to...

00:02:50.094 --> 00:02:51.590
...what we did in the two-dimensional case...

00:02:51.590 --> 00:02:52.712
...with the line integrals.

00:02:52.712 --> 00:02:54.595
So we have a dS.

00:02:54.595 --> 00:02:56.244
A dS is a little chunk of area...

00:02:56.244 --> 00:02:57.569
...of that surface.

00:02:57.569 --> 00:02:59.524
So that is dS.

00:02:59.524 --> 00:03:01.456
So this is going to be area.

00:03:01.456 --> 00:03:02.304
And if we want to break...

00:03:02.304 --> 00:03:03.077
This is...

00:03:03.077 --> 00:03:04.404
We want to pick particular units...

00:03:04.404 --> 00:03:06.053
This could be square...

00:03:06.053 --> 00:03:07.460
This could be square meters.

00:03:07.460 --> 00:03:08.344
And I think when we do...

00:03:08.344 --> 00:03:10.137
...particular units, it starts to make...

00:03:10.137 --> 00:03:11.971
...a little bit more concrete sense.

00:03:11.971 --> 00:03:13.310
Now, the normal vector...

00:03:13.310 --> 00:03:14.546
...at that dS...

00:03:14.546 --> 00:03:15.661
The normal vector is going to...

00:03:15.661 --> 00:03:16.535
...point right out of it.

00:03:16.535 --> 00:03:18.604
It's literally normal to that plane.

00:03:18.604 --> 00:03:20.818
It's literally normal to that plane.

00:03:20.818 --> 00:03:22.374
It has a magnitude 1.

00:03:22.374 --> 00:03:24.409
So that is our unit normal vector.

00:03:24.409 --> 00:03:27.568
And f is defined throughout this three-dimensional space.

00:03:27.568 --> 00:03:28.855
You give me any (x,y,z),

00:03:28.855 --> 00:03:30.089
...I'll know its mass density,

00:03:30.089 --> 00:03:30.873
...I'll know its velocity,

00:03:30.873 --> 00:03:32.059
...and I'll get some f.

00:03:32.059 --> 00:03:34.009
I'll get some f at any point...

00:03:34.009 --> 00:03:36.723
...at any point in three-dimensional space,

00:03:36.723 --> 00:03:38.458
...including on the surface.

00:03:38.458 --> 00:03:39.908
Including right over here.

00:03:39.908 --> 00:03:41.925
So right over here, f might look...

00:03:41.925 --> 00:03:44.376
...f might look something like this.

00:03:44.376 --> 00:03:47.169
So that is f right at that point.

00:03:47.169 --> 00:03:48.161
Right at that point.

00:03:48.161 --> 00:03:49.142
So what does all of this mean?

00:03:49.142 --> 00:03:50.408
Well when you take the dot product...

00:03:50.408 --> 00:03:51.992
...of two vectors, this is essentially saying,

00:03:51.992 --> 00:03:53.694
"How much do they go together?"

00:03:53.694 --> 00:03:55.276
And since n is a unit vector,

00:03:55.276 --> 00:03:56.776
...since it has a magnitude 1,

00:03:56.776 --> 00:03:58.111
...it's-- this is essentially saying..

00:03:58.111 --> 00:03:58.895
"What is..."

00:03:58.895 --> 00:04:00.421
"What is the magnitude...

00:04:00.421 --> 00:04:01.522
...of the component of f...

00:04:01.522 --> 00:04:03.191
...that's going in the direction of n?"

00:04:03.191 --> 00:04:04.338
Or the component-- Or...

00:04:04.338 --> 00:04:05.941
"What is the magnitude of the...

00:04:05.941 --> 00:04:06.759
...component of f that is...

00:04:06.759 --> 00:04:08.740
...normal to the surface?"

00:04:08.740 --> 00:04:10.595
Or "How much of f is normal...

00:04:10.595 --> 00:04:11.311
...to the surface?"

00:04:11.311 --> 00:04:12.820
So the component of f that is...

00:04:12.820 --> 00:04:13.921
...normal to the surface...

00:04:13.921 --> 00:04:16.053
...might look something like...

00:04:16.053 --> 00:04:17.653
...might look something...

00:04:17.653 --> 00:04:19.777
...like that.

00:04:19.777 --> 00:04:21.395
Might look something like that.

00:04:21.395 --> 00:04:22.875
And this right over here...

00:04:22.875 --> 00:04:24.212
...will essentially just give...

00:04:24.212 --> 00:04:25.777
...the magnitude of that.

00:04:25.777 --> 00:04:26.730
And it's just going to...

00:04:26.730 --> 00:04:29.007
It's just going to keep the units of f.

00:04:29.007 --> 00:04:30.476
n, right over here, just specifies...

00:04:30.476 --> 00:04:32.864
...a direction. It has no units associated with it.

00:04:32.864 --> 00:04:33.944
It's dimensionless.

00:04:33.944 --> 00:04:36.093
f's units are going to be...

00:04:36.093 --> 00:04:37.875
...units of mass density,

00:04:37.875 --> 00:04:38.827
So it could be...

00:04:38.827 --> 00:04:39.928
It's going to be...

00:04:39.928 --> 00:04:41.008
Let's say it could be...

00:04:41.008 --> 00:04:44.496
...kilogram per meter-cubed.

00:04:44.496 --> 00:04:45.195
That's...

00:04:45.195 --> 00:04:46.924
Well that's actually just the rho part.

00:04:46.924 --> 00:04:48.878
So it's mass density times velocity.

00:04:48.878 --> 00:04:51.216
Times meters per second.

00:04:51.216 --> 00:04:52.271
Let me write it in those colors...

00:04:52.271 --> 00:04:52.911
...so we have...

00:04:52.911 --> 00:04:54.437
...clear what's happening here.

00:04:54.437 --> 00:04:55.604
So the units of f...

00:04:55.604 --> 00:04:57.878
...are going to be the units of rho...

00:04:57.878 --> 00:04:59.204
...which are going to be...

00:04:59.204 --> 00:05:02.372
...kilogram per cubic meter...

00:05:02.372 --> 00:05:03.579
That's mass density.

00:05:03.579 --> 00:05:05.838
...times the units of v...

00:05:05.838 --> 00:05:07.646
...which is meters per second.

00:05:07.646 --> 00:05:09.124
Meters per second.

00:05:09.124 --> 00:05:11.776
And we're going to multiply that times meters squared.

00:05:11.776 --> 00:05:12.837
So what you have is...

00:05:12.837 --> 00:05:13.557
You have a meter and then...

00:05:13.557 --> 00:05:14.894
...a meter squared in the numerator...

00:05:14.894 --> 00:05:16.512
That's meters cubed in the numerator.

00:05:16.512 --> 00:05:17.946
And meters cubed in the denominator.

00:05:17.946 --> 00:05:20.142
That, that, that cancels out.

00:05:20.142 --> 00:05:22.846
And so the units that we get for this...

00:05:22.846 --> 00:05:24.043
The units that we get for this...

00:05:24.043 --> 00:05:26.474
...are kilogram per second.

00:05:26.474 --> 00:05:27.971
And so the way to conceptualize it...

00:05:27.971 --> 00:05:29.833
Given how we've defined f...

00:05:29.833 --> 00:05:32.041
...when we say what we say f represents...

00:05:32.041 --> 00:05:33.361
The way to conceptualize this...

00:05:33.361 --> 00:05:35.576
This is saying, "How much mass..."

00:05:35.576 --> 00:05:37.399
"How much mass, given this mass density,

00:05:37.399 --> 00:05:39.704
...this velocity, is going directly...

00:05:39.704 --> 00:05:41.822
...out of this little dS,

00:05:41.822 --> 00:05:42.359
...this little...

00:05:42.359 --> 00:05:44.138
...'infinitesimally' chunk of surface...

00:05:44.138 --> 00:05:46.156
...in a given amount of time?"

00:05:46.156 --> 00:05:46.880
And then if we were to add up...

00:05:46.880 --> 00:05:48.130
...all of the dS-es,

00:05:48.130 --> 00:05:50.055
...and this is what essentially that surface integral is,

00:05:50.055 --> 00:05:52.033
...we're essentially saying,

00:05:52.033 --> 00:05:53.270
"How much mass,

00:05:53.270 --> 00:05:54.606
...in kilograms per second,

00:05:54.606 --> 00:05:55.324
...that's what we picked...

00:05:55.324 --> 00:05:56.510
How much mass...

00:05:56.510 --> 00:05:59.091
...is traveling across this surface...

00:05:59.091 --> 00:06:01.721
...at any given moment in time?"

00:06:01.721 --> 00:06:03.351
And this is really the same idea we do with...

00:06:03.351 --> 00:06:04.287
...the line integrals.

00:06:04.287 --> 00:06:07.908
This is essentially the flux through a two-dimensional surface.

00:06:07.908 --> 00:06:09.352
So this is...

00:06:09.352 --> 00:06:12.605
...the flux through a 2D surface.

00:06:18.559 --> 00:06:19.164
And this isn't like...

00:06:19.164 --> 00:06:21.582
...some crazy, abstract thing.

00:06:21.582 --> 00:06:22.762
I mean, you could imagine...

00:06:22.762 --> 00:06:24.023
You know, you could imagine...

00:06:24.023 --> 00:06:26.717
...something like water vapor in your bathroom.

00:06:26.717 --> 00:06:27.876
Water vapor in your bathroom.

00:06:27.876 --> 00:06:28.722
And I like to imagine that,

00:06:28.722 --> 00:06:29.910
...because that's actually visible,

00:06:29.910 --> 00:06:32.107
...especially when sunlight is shining through it.

00:06:32.107 --> 00:06:33.908
And we've all seen water vapor...

00:06:33.908 --> 00:06:34.579
...through a...

00:06:34.579 --> 00:06:35.725
...water vapor in our bathroom when...

00:06:35.725 --> 00:06:37.241
...you have a ray of sunlight, and you can see...

00:06:37.241 --> 00:06:38.240
...how the particles...

00:06:38.240 --> 00:06:39.791
...how the particles are traveling.

00:06:39.791 --> 00:06:41.321
And you see they have a certain density...

00:06:41.321 --> 00:06:42.228
...at different points.

00:06:42.228 --> 00:06:43.441
And so you could imagine...

00:06:43.441 --> 00:06:44.526
You could imagine...

00:06:44.526 --> 00:06:46.493
You care about the surface...

00:06:46.493 --> 00:06:48.493
...the surface of your...

00:06:48.493 --> 00:06:50.394
Maybe you have a window.

00:06:50.394 --> 00:06:52.509
Maybe you have a window in the bathroom.

00:06:52.509 --> 00:06:53.885
So you have a window.

00:06:53.885 --> 00:06:55.021
And so, if you were...

00:06:55.021 --> 00:06:57.058
If the surface was the window,

00:06:57.058 --> 00:06:57.704
...and the window...

00:06:57.704 --> 00:06:58.777
And let's say the window's open,

00:06:58.777 --> 00:06:59.639
...so it's kind of a...

00:06:59.639 --> 00:07:01.072
There's nothing physical there.

00:07:01.072 --> 00:07:02.031
It's just kind of a...

00:07:02.031 --> 00:07:03.899
...a rectangular surface that...

00:07:03.899 --> 00:07:06.331
...things can pass freely through,

00:07:06.331 --> 00:07:08.014
...if-- and f was essentially...

00:07:08.014 --> 00:07:10.128
...the mass density of the water vapor times...

00:07:10.128 --> 00:07:11.670
...the velocity of the water vapor,

00:07:11.670 --> 00:07:13.677
...then this thing right over here will essentially tell you...

00:07:13.677 --> 00:07:15.687
...the mass of water vapor that is traveling...

00:07:15.687 --> 00:07:18.341
...through that window at any given moment of time.

00:07:18.341 --> 00:07:19.774
Another way to think about it is...

00:07:19.774 --> 00:07:20.804
Imagine a...

00:07:20.804 --> 00:07:21.862
Imagine a river.

00:07:21.862 --> 00:07:23.695
And I'm going to conceptualize this river...

00:07:23.695 --> 00:07:24.606
...as kind of a...

00:07:24.606 --> 00:07:26.644
...just a section of the river.

00:07:26.644 --> 00:07:27.894
And I'm conceptualizing it...

00:07:27.894 --> 00:07:28.718
This is kind of...

00:07:28.718 --> 00:07:29.218
...a river.

00:07:29.218 --> 00:07:30.449
Obviously this would be the surface...

00:07:30.449 --> 00:07:31.573
...that we normally see.

00:07:31.573 --> 00:07:32.960
But obviously it has some depth.

00:07:32.960 --> 00:07:34.585
It's three-dimensional in nature.

00:07:34.585 --> 00:07:36.838
And so we would know the density.

00:07:36.838 --> 00:07:37.686
Maybe it's constant.

00:07:37.686 --> 00:07:40.060
You know the density, and you know the velocity...

00:07:40.060 --> 00:07:41.105
...at any point.

00:07:41.105 --> 00:07:42.786
That's what f gives us.

00:07:42.786 --> 00:07:44.558
So that tells us...

00:07:44.558 --> 00:07:46.789
As we said, we could view that as the...

00:07:46.789 --> 00:07:49.358
...momentum density at any given point in time.

00:07:49.358 --> 00:07:51.939
And maybe our surface is some type of a net.

00:07:51.939 --> 00:07:53.434
Our surface is some type of a net.

00:07:53.434 --> 00:07:55.010
And the net doesn't even have to be rectangular.

00:07:55.010 --> 00:07:56.521
It could be some weird-shaped net.

00:07:56.521 --> 00:07:57.830
But I'll do it in rectangular, just because it's...

00:07:57.830 --> 00:07:58.978
...easier to draw.

00:07:58.978 --> 00:08:02.041
It's some type of net that in no way impedes the flow...

00:08:02.041 --> 00:08:02.975
...of the fluid.

00:08:02.975 --> 00:08:04.124
Then once again,

00:08:04.124 --> 00:08:05.658
...when you evaluate this integral,

00:08:05.658 --> 00:08:08.045
...it would tell you the mass of fluid that is flowing...

00:08:08.045 --> 00:08:09.069
...through that net...

00:08:09.069 --> 00:08:11.040
...at any given moment of time.

00:08:11.040 --> 00:08:12.057
So hopefully this makes...

00:08:12.057 --> 00:08:14.194
...a little bit of conceptual sense now.

00:08:14.194 --> 00:08:15.044
In the next few videos,

00:08:15.044 --> 00:08:16.088
...we'll actually think about...

00:08:16.088 --> 00:08:16.804
...how to...

00:08:16.804 --> 00:08:18.304
...how to calculate this,

00:08:18.304 --> 00:08:20.008
...and how we can actually represent it...

00:08:20.008 --> 00:08:21.745
...in different ways.
