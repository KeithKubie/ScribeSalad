00:00:01.863 --> 00:00:03.319
- [Instructor] In this
video, let's look at

00:00:03.319 --> 00:00:06.630
the periodic trends for ionization energy.

00:00:06.630 --> 00:00:07.723
So, for this period,

00:00:07.723 --> 00:00:09.524
as we go across from lithium,

00:00:09.524 --> 00:00:11.668
all the way over to neon,

00:00:11.668 --> 00:00:15.877
so as we go this way,
across our periodic table,

00:00:15.877 --> 00:00:18.158
we can see, in general,
there's an increase

00:00:18.158 --> 00:00:20.384
in the ionization energy.

00:00:20.384 --> 00:00:24.375
So, lithium is positive
520 kilojoules per mole.

00:00:24.375 --> 00:00:27.841
Beryllium's goes up to
900 kilojoules per mole,

00:00:27.841 --> 00:00:30.628
and then again, in general,
we see this increase

00:00:30.628 --> 00:00:34.542
in ionization energies going over to neon.

00:00:34.542 --> 00:00:35.866
So, going across a period,

00:00:35.866 --> 00:00:39.427
there's an increase in
the ionization energy.

00:00:39.427 --> 00:00:40.647
And that's because,

00:00:40.647 --> 00:00:42.259
as we go across our period,

00:00:42.259 --> 00:00:46.455
there's an increase in the
effective nuclear charge.

00:00:46.455 --> 00:00:48.474
So, increase in Z effective.

00:00:48.474 --> 00:00:50.963
And remember, the formula for that is

00:00:50.963 --> 00:00:54.094
the effective nuclear charge is equal to

00:00:54.094 --> 00:00:56.923
the actual number of protons, which is Z,

00:00:56.923 --> 00:00:58.975
and from that we subtract S,

00:00:58.975 --> 00:01:01.600
which is the average
number of inner electrons

00:01:01.600 --> 00:01:04.195
shielding our outer electrons.

00:01:04.195 --> 00:01:06.698
So, let's examine this in more detail,

00:01:06.698 --> 00:01:09.756
looking at lithium and beryllium.

00:01:09.756 --> 00:01:11.732
Lithium has atomic number three,

00:01:11.732 --> 00:01:13.992
so three protons in the nucleus,

00:01:13.992 --> 00:01:16.389
so positive three charge,

00:01:16.389 --> 00:01:19.134
and lithium's electron
configuration we know

00:01:19.134 --> 00:01:21.134
is one s two, two s one.

00:01:22.192 --> 00:01:25.012
So, two electrons in our one s orbital,

00:01:25.012 --> 00:01:28.878
and one electron in the two s orbital.

00:01:28.878 --> 00:01:31.337
Beryllium has one more proton

00:01:31.337 --> 00:01:32.925
and one more electron.

00:01:32.925 --> 00:01:37.192
So one more proton in the
nucleus, so a plus 4 charge,

00:01:37.192 --> 00:01:40.528
and for beryllium, the
electron configuration is

00:01:40.528 --> 00:01:42.702
one s two, two s two.

00:01:42.702 --> 00:01:45.285
So two electrons in the one s orbital,

00:01:45.285 --> 00:01:49.650
and then two electrons
in the two s orbital.

00:01:49.650 --> 00:01:52.321
Let's calculate the
effective nuclear charge

00:01:52.321 --> 00:01:54.065
for both of these,

00:01:54.065 --> 00:01:56.570
and first, we'll start with lithium.

00:01:56.570 --> 00:01:58.183
So for lithium,

00:01:58.183 --> 00:02:01.741
lithium has a plus three
charge in the nucleus,

00:02:01.741 --> 00:02:05.880
so the effective nuclear charge
is equal to positive three,

00:02:05.880 --> 00:02:09.987
and from that we subtract
the average number of inner

00:02:09.987 --> 00:02:12.558
electrons shielding our outer electrons,

00:02:12.558 --> 00:02:14.583
in this case, we have these two inner,

00:02:14.583 --> 00:02:18.517
or core electrons, that are
shielding our outer electron,

00:02:18.517 --> 00:02:22.328
our valence electron, from this
full positive three charge.

00:02:22.328 --> 00:02:24.855
So we know that like charges repel,

00:02:24.855 --> 00:02:26.475
so this electron is going to repel

00:02:26.475 --> 00:02:28.600
this electron a little bit,

00:02:28.600 --> 00:02:31.368
and this electron repels this electron.

00:02:31.368 --> 00:02:34.523
And these two inner core
electrons of lithium

00:02:34.523 --> 00:02:35.947
have a shielding effect,

00:02:35.947 --> 00:02:37.335
they protect the outer electron

00:02:37.335 --> 00:02:39.827
from the full positive three charge.

00:02:39.827 --> 00:02:41.712
So there's two shielding electrons,

00:02:41.712 --> 00:02:45.028
so for a quick effective
nuclear charge calculation

00:02:45.028 --> 00:02:49.216
positive three minus two
gives us a value of plus one

00:02:49.216 --> 00:02:51.046
for the effective nuclear charge.

00:02:51.046 --> 00:02:53.847
So, it's like this outer
electron of lithium

00:02:53.847 --> 00:02:57.309
is feeling a nuclear charge of plus one,

00:02:57.309 --> 00:02:59.924
which pulls it toward the nucleus, right?

00:02:59.924 --> 00:03:02.506
So, there's an attractive
force between the outer

00:03:02.506 --> 00:03:04.589
electron and our nucleus.

00:03:06.647 --> 00:03:09.297
Now, the actual calculation for this um,

00:03:09.297 --> 00:03:10.130
Z is--

00:03:10.130 --> 00:03:13.089
S I should say, does not
have to be an integer,

00:03:13.089 --> 00:03:15.798
and the actual value for
lithium is approximately

00:03:15.798 --> 00:03:19.823
one point three, but our
quick, crude calculation

00:03:19.823 --> 00:03:21.579
tells us positive one.

00:03:21.579 --> 00:03:24.578
Let's do the same
calculation for beryllium,

00:03:24.578 --> 00:03:27.592
so the effective nuclear
charge for beryllium

00:03:27.592 --> 00:03:31.102
is equal to the number of protons, right,

00:03:31.102 --> 00:03:33.199
which for beryllium is positive four,

00:03:33.199 --> 00:03:37.263
and from that, we subtract
the number of inner electrons

00:03:37.263 --> 00:03:39.891
that are shielding the outer electrons.

00:03:39.891 --> 00:03:41.663
So, it's a similar situation,

00:03:41.663 --> 00:03:44.617
we have two inner electrons
that are shielding

00:03:44.617 --> 00:03:46.789
this outer electron, they're repelling

00:03:46.789 --> 00:03:48.220
this outer electron,

00:03:48.220 --> 00:03:51.275
shielding the outer electron
from the full positive

00:03:51.275 --> 00:03:53.557
four charge of the nucleus.

00:03:53.557 --> 00:03:55.866
SO we say there are two inner electrons,

00:03:55.866 --> 00:03:57.749
so the effective nuclear charge is

00:03:57.749 --> 00:03:59.862
positive four minus two,

00:03:59.862 --> 00:04:04.221
giving us an effective nuclear
charge of positive two.

00:04:04.221 --> 00:04:07.180
In reality, the effective
nuclear charge is

00:04:07.180 --> 00:04:10.422
approximately one point nine,

00:04:10.422 --> 00:04:13.103
and that's because beryllium
has another electron

00:04:13.103 --> 00:04:14.305
in its two s orbital over here,

00:04:14.305 --> 00:04:17.636
which does effect this
electron a little bit.

00:04:17.636 --> 00:04:19.227
It repels it a little bit,

00:04:19.227 --> 00:04:22.467
and so it actually deceases
the effective nuclear charge

00:04:22.467 --> 00:04:23.987
to about, one point nine.

00:04:23.987 --> 00:04:27.761
But again, for a quick
calculation, positive two works.

00:04:27.761 --> 00:04:30.232
So, the outer electron for beryllium,

00:04:30.232 --> 00:04:31.994
let's just choose this one again,

00:04:31.994 --> 00:04:34.074
is feeling an effective nuclear charge

00:04:34.074 --> 00:04:36.939
of positive two, which means that,

00:04:36.939 --> 00:04:39.874
it's going to be pulled
closer to the nucleus,

00:04:39.874 --> 00:04:43.773
there's a greater attractive
force on this outer electron

00:04:43.773 --> 00:04:46.907
for beryllium, as compared
to this outer electron

00:04:46.907 --> 00:04:48.080
for lithium.

00:04:48.080 --> 00:04:51.379
The effective nuclear
charge is only plus one

00:04:51.379 --> 00:04:53.441
for this outer electron,

00:04:53.441 --> 00:04:57.925
and because of this, the
beryllium atom is smaller, right?

00:04:57.925 --> 00:05:01.668
The two s orbital gets
smaller, and the atom itself

00:05:01.668 --> 00:05:02.501
is smaller.

00:05:02.501 --> 00:05:05.235
Beryllium is smaller than lithium.

00:05:05.235 --> 00:05:06.970
So this outer electron here,

00:05:06.970 --> 00:05:08.696
let me switch colors again,

00:05:08.696 --> 00:05:12.965
this outer electron for
beryllium is closer to

00:05:12.965 --> 00:05:16.341
the nucleus than the outer
electron for lithium.

00:05:16.341 --> 00:05:18.764
It feels a greater attractive force,

00:05:18.764 --> 00:05:20.770
and therefore it takes more energy

00:05:20.770 --> 00:05:25.451
to pull this electron away from
the neutral beryllium atom,

00:05:25.451 --> 00:05:28.560
and that's the reason for
the higher ionization energy.

00:05:28.560 --> 00:05:30.475
So beryllium has an ionization energy

00:05:30.475 --> 00:05:33.014
of positive 900 kilojoules per mole,

00:05:33.014 --> 00:05:37.674
compared to lithium's of
520 kilojoules per mole.

00:05:37.674 --> 00:05:41.954
So it has to do with the
effective nuclear charge.

00:05:41.954 --> 00:05:44.331
So far we've compared
lithium and beryllium

00:05:44.331 --> 00:05:46.706
and we saw that the ionization energy

00:05:46.706 --> 00:05:49.196
went from positive 520 kilojoules per mole

00:05:49.196 --> 00:05:51.657
to 900 kilojoules per mole,

00:05:51.657 --> 00:05:53.494
and we said that was because of the

00:05:53.494 --> 00:05:56.223
increased effective nuclear
charge for beryllium,

00:05:56.223 --> 00:05:59.172
but as we go from beryllium to boron,

00:05:59.172 --> 00:06:01.646
there's still an increased
effective nuclear charge,

00:06:01.646 --> 00:06:04.007
but notice our ionization energy goes

00:06:04.007 --> 00:06:06.856
from 900 kilojoules per mole for beryllium

00:06:06.856 --> 00:06:10.054
to only 800 kilojoules per mole for boron,

00:06:10.054 --> 00:06:13.359
so there's a slight decrease
in the ionization energy.

00:06:13.359 --> 00:06:16.346
And let's look at the electron
configuration of boron

00:06:16.346 --> 00:06:18.116
to see if we can explain that.

00:06:18.116 --> 00:06:19.848
Boron has five electrons,

00:06:19.848 --> 00:06:22.486
so the electron
configuration is one s two,

00:06:22.486 --> 00:06:24.735
two s two, and two p one.

00:06:24.735 --> 00:06:28.356
So that fifth electron
goes into a two p orbital,

00:06:28.356 --> 00:06:31.607
and the two p orbital is higher in energy

00:06:31.607 --> 00:06:33.681
than a two s orbital, which means

00:06:33.681 --> 00:06:35.950
the electron in the two p orbital

00:06:35.950 --> 00:06:38.877
is on average, further
away from the nucleus

00:06:38.877 --> 00:06:41.816
that the two electron
in the two s orbital.

00:06:41.816 --> 00:06:43.652
So if we just sketch
this out really quickly,

00:06:43.652 --> 00:06:45.378
let's say that's my two s orbital,

00:06:45.378 --> 00:06:47.279
I have two electrons in there,

00:06:47.279 --> 00:06:49.642
and this one electron in the two p orbital

00:06:49.642 --> 00:06:53.580
is on average further
away from the nucleus.

00:06:53.580 --> 00:06:57.406
So, those two electrons
in the two s orbital

00:06:57.406 --> 00:07:01.764
actually can repel this
electron in the two p orbital.

00:07:01.764 --> 00:07:04.404
So, there's a little bit
extra shielding there

00:07:04.404 --> 00:07:08.552
of the two p electron
from the full attraction

00:07:08.552 --> 00:07:10.927
of the nucleus, right?

00:07:10.927 --> 00:07:13.430
So, even though we have
five protons in the nucleus,

00:07:13.430 --> 00:07:15.901
and a positive five charge for boron,

00:07:15.901 --> 00:07:18.357
the fact that these two s electrons

00:07:18.357 --> 00:07:20.800
add a little bit of extra shielding means

00:07:20.800 --> 00:07:24.378
it's easier to pull this electron away.

00:07:24.378 --> 00:07:27.059
So, it turns out to be a
little bit easier to pull

00:07:27.059 --> 00:07:29.019
this electron in the two p orbital away

00:07:29.019 --> 00:07:31.192
due to these two s electrons.

00:07:31.192 --> 00:07:33.568
And that's the reason
for this slight decrease

00:07:33.568 --> 00:07:35.711
in ionization energy.

00:07:35.711 --> 00:07:37.456
As we go from boron to carbon,

00:07:37.456 --> 00:07:39.736
we see an increase in ionization energy,

00:07:39.736 --> 00:07:41.347
from carbon to nitrogen,

00:07:41.347 --> 00:07:43.488
an increase in ionization energy.

00:07:43.488 --> 00:07:45.603
Again, we attribute that to increased

00:07:45.603 --> 00:07:48.286
effective nuclear charge,

00:07:48.286 --> 00:07:50.560
but when we go from nitrogen to oxygen,

00:07:50.560 --> 00:07:52.471
we see a slight decrease again.

00:07:52.471 --> 00:07:54.832
From about 1400 kilojoules per mole,

00:07:54.832 --> 00:07:58.551
down to about 1300 kilojoules
per mole for oxygen.

00:07:58.551 --> 00:08:01.961
So, let's see if we can
explain that by writing out

00:08:01.961 --> 00:08:06.020
some electron configurations
for nitrogen and oxygen.

00:08:06.020 --> 00:08:10.365
Nitrogen has seven
electrons to think about.

00:08:10.365 --> 00:08:12.366
So it's electron configuration is

00:08:12.366 --> 00:08:15.533
one s two, two s two, and two p three.

00:08:18.172 --> 00:08:20.484
So that takes care of all seven electrons.

00:08:20.484 --> 00:08:23.626
For oxygen, we have another electron, so

00:08:23.626 --> 00:08:26.975
one s two, two s two, two p four

00:08:26.975 --> 00:08:29.993
is the electron configuration for oxygen.

00:08:29.993 --> 00:08:32.510
Let's just draw using orbital notation

00:08:32.510 --> 00:08:35.645
the two s orbital and the two p orbital.

00:08:35.645 --> 00:08:38.748
So for nitrogen, here's our two s orbital.

00:08:38.748 --> 00:08:40.418
We have two electrons in there,

00:08:40.418 --> 00:08:42.589
so let's draw in our two electrons.

00:08:42.589 --> 00:08:44.459
And for our two p orbitals,

00:08:44.459 --> 00:08:45.791
we have three electrons.

00:08:45.791 --> 00:08:48.360
So here are the two p orbitals,

00:08:48.360 --> 00:08:52.072
and let's draw in our three electrons

00:08:52.072 --> 00:08:53.999
using orbital notation.

00:08:53.999 --> 00:08:55.930
Let's do the same thing for oxygen.

00:08:55.930 --> 00:08:58.183
So there's the two s orbital
for oxygen, which is full,

00:08:58.183 --> 00:09:00.760
so we'll sketch in those two electrons,

00:09:00.760 --> 00:09:04.910
and we have four electrons
in the two p orbitals.

00:09:04.910 --> 00:09:06.987
So let me draw in the two p orbitals.

00:09:06.987 --> 00:09:08.137
There's one electron,

00:09:08.137 --> 00:09:10.113
there's two, there's three,

00:09:10.113 --> 00:09:13.131
and notice what happens when
we add the fourth electron.

00:09:13.131 --> 00:09:15.456
We're adding it to an orbital that already

00:09:15.456 --> 00:09:17.665
has an electron in it,

00:09:17.665 --> 00:09:21.937
so when I add that fourth
electron to the two p orbital,

00:09:21.937 --> 00:09:24.971
it's repelled by the electron
that's already there,

00:09:24.971 --> 00:09:28.478
which means it's easier to
remove one of those electrons,

00:09:28.478 --> 00:09:30.505
so electrons have like charges,

00:09:30.505 --> 00:09:32.513
and like charges repel.

00:09:32.513 --> 00:09:34.340
And so that's the reason for this

00:09:34.340 --> 00:09:37.297
slight decrease in ionization energy.

00:09:37.297 --> 00:09:40.538
So, it turns out to be a little bit easier

00:09:40.538 --> 00:09:43.052
to remove an electron from an oxygen atom,

00:09:43.052 --> 00:09:45.905
than nitrogen, due to this repulsion

00:09:45.905 --> 00:09:47.829
in this two p orbital.

00:09:47.829 --> 00:09:51.552
From there on, we see
our general trend again.

00:09:51.552 --> 00:09:55.542
The ionization energy for
fluorine is up to 1681,

00:09:55.542 --> 00:09:58.264
and then again for
neon, we see an increase

00:09:58.264 --> 00:10:00.749
in the ionization energy due to

00:10:00.749 --> 00:10:02.809
the increased effective nuclear charge.
