00:00:01.700 --> 00:00:04.520
Immanuel Kant was one of the world's greatest philosophers.

00:00:04.600 --> 00:00:11.900
The Critique of Pure Judgement, perhaps his most subtle and beguiling work, was first published in 1790.

00:00:11.920 --> 00:00:16.320
Kant says that human beings are capable of two ways of approaching the world:

00:00:16.320 --> 00:00:17.680
a subjective

00:00:17.680 --> 00:00:19.420
and an objective way.

00:00:19.480 --> 00:00:24.340
Or, as we might put it, a lower and a higher way.

00:00:24.340 --> 00:00:27.820
The subjective side of us is focused on the senses,

00:00:28.500 --> 00:00:33.780
it is self-centered, short term, amoral and largely out for itself.

00:00:35.680 --> 00:00:43.300
The objective side is based on reason, and allows us to think long-term, morally and wrthout regard for ourselves.

00:00:44.580 --> 00:00:46.240
In The Critique of Pure Judgement,

00:00:46.240 --> 00:00:48.740
Kant explores the distinction between objective

00:00:48.740 --> 00:00:51.700
and subjective in the realm of aesthetics.

00:00:51.700 --> 00:00:55.720
In other words, in our relationship to art and nature.

00:00:55.720 --> 00:00:58.940
Kant makes huge claims for art and nature.

00:00:58.940 --> 00:01:01.560
He believes that in our appreciation of these,

00:01:01.560 --> 00:01:06.600
we can develop our capacity to have a more reliably objective gaze upon existence in general.

00:01:06.600 --> 00:01:07.900
Take the example of how we feel

00:01:07.900 --> 00:01:13.020
when we’re out for a walk and are charmed by a beautiful piece of countryside.

00:01:13.020 --> 00:01:17.080
We appreciate nature without wanting anything in particular from it.

00:01:17.080 --> 00:01:21.420
We are not like a farmer, a developer, or a traveller;

00:01:21.420 --> 00:01:24.320
we’re merely delighting in it for its own sake.

00:01:25.160 --> 00:01:30.120
And this for Kant is a prime example of an objective relationship to reality.

00:01:30.120 --> 00:01:32.680
It’s also why Kant is keen to say:

00:01:32.680 --> 00:01:34.720
that whenever sexual desire

00:01:34.720 --> 00:01:37.640
enters into our connection with beautiful things,

00:01:37.640 --> 00:01:40.480
we are no longer seeing them properly.

00:01:40.800 --> 00:01:45.780
For the objective gaze is immediately clouded by the pressure of subjective impulse.

00:01:54.040 --> 00:01:59.480
Kant was especially interested in experiences in nature of what he called the sublime.

00:01:59.500 --> 00:02:07.660
Moments when we feel awed by encounters with the mightiest aspects of the natural world:

00:02:07.660 --> 00:02:13.600
the night sky, glaciers, waterfalls... ocean storms.

00:02:13.600 --> 00:02:16.620
Often the things we find beautiful bear the mark of other human hands,

00:02:16.620 --> 00:02:19.600
for example, watercolour paintings or pretty gardens.

00:02:19.600 --> 00:02:23.460
But what we find sublime is altogether more momentous;

00:02:23.460 --> 00:02:29.300
it is when we feel the presence of universal forces that have no reference whatever to anything human.

00:02:29.300 --> 00:02:31.700
In contact with the sublime aspects of nature,

00:02:31.700 --> 00:02:35.880
we are ineluctably led towards an objective apprehension of reality.

00:02:35.880 --> 00:02:38.320
The sublime corrects our egoism

00:02:38.320 --> 00:02:41.060
an gives us a visceral sense

00:02:41.060 --> 00:02:48.280
of how tiny and insignificant we are in a domain that is fundamentally alien to us.

00:02:49.580 --> 00:02:52.100
But our frailty is not the end of the story:

00:02:52.100 --> 00:02:55.340
another kind of strength is revealed,

00:02:55.720 --> 00:03:05.120
for we become propercljy noble when our minds fully appreciate their limitations an are awed by all that exceeds them.

00:03:05.200 --> 00:03:08.860
Kant wasinterested in aesthetic experience,

00:03:08.860 --> 00:03:11.520
because he viewed It as a training ground for a more moral relationship to the world.

00:03:11.520 --> 00:03:15.980
Sublime scenes were, for this great philosopher, an introduction to wisdom.

00:03:16.780 --> 00:03:19.340

00:03:20.460 --> 00:03:21.120
Thank you.

00:03:21.680 --> 00:03:22.900
See you next week.
