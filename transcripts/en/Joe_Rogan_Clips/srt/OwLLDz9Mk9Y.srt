1
00:00:00,990 --> 00:00:05,160
The Joe Rogan experience.
So you are running for something now.

2
00:00:05,161 --> 00:00:09,060
What are you doing? Um, I'm gonna
go, I've said that for nine years.

3
00:00:09,061 --> 00:00:13,590
Quite consistently. I would like to say,
uh, that I was going to run in 2020.

4
00:00:13,591 --> 00:00:18,420
We had set terms in our politics,
like you always had,

5
00:00:18,450 --> 00:00:20,610
you've had a full year.
We arrange it into a five year,

6
00:00:20,611 --> 00:00:22,230
but then we've gone
back to the old system,

7
00:00:22,530 --> 00:00:27,530
which is where the prime minister of
the country can choose when they have an

8
00:00:27,571 --> 00:00:30,390
election and it can be
anywhere up to a day, you know,

9
00:00:30,630 --> 00:00:35,360
the next day after the election or, uh, up
to five years later. So we have no idea.

10
00:00:35,361 --> 00:00:37,620
Like, so the prime minister
can decide, you know what,

11
00:00:37,650 --> 00:00:39,870
we'll have another election in two weeks.
Yeah.

12
00:00:39,871 --> 00:00:41,670
And they wouldn't do that for them.
But you know,

13
00:00:41,671 --> 00:00:43,170
like we had the general action of 15,

14
00:00:43,171 --> 00:00:48,171
2015 and then 2017 having
been in for only two years.

15
00:00:49,110 --> 00:00:51,660
Um, Theresa May was persuaded
that if you go for lecture now,

16
00:00:51,661 --> 00:00:52,321
you're going to win big.

17
00:00:52,321 --> 00:00:55,620
You can want tons of extra seats and then
we'll be able to do whatever we want.

18
00:00:55,890 --> 00:00:59,100
But in fact they lost seats
and that actually, so you know,

19
00:00:59,101 --> 00:01:03,550
sometimes they grab it sometimes. Um,
you go in there fourth, there's a,

20
00:01:03,680 --> 00:01:06,630
there's a traditional thing of going into
the fourth year because if you've got

21
00:01:06,631 --> 00:01:09,920
all the economics going,
everything's pretty good. Okay,
let's go now we've got 40,

22
00:01:09,940 --> 00:01:13,290
you've got a year to spare, but let's
go in the fourth year and we can, uh,

23
00:01:13,380 --> 00:01:16,800
cause we know we're in a good place and
then you have to allow I think six weeks

24
00:01:16,801 --> 00:01:19,950
for an election campaign.
But yeah, that's, we do that.

25
00:01:19,951 --> 00:01:23,490
I think other countries do that,
but I am sure to an American you go,

26
00:01:23,760 --> 00:01:26,850
that sounds crazy. But anyway, that's
what we've been doing for some time.

27
00:01:26,880 --> 00:01:30,570
What are you going to run for a member
of parliament for some constituency

28
00:01:30,750 --> 00:01:33,920
hopefully in England would be my
thing as opposed to, you know,

29
00:01:33,921 --> 00:01:37,050
the kingdom because there's whales
and Scotland. And is this a step,

30
00:01:37,710 --> 00:01:41,360
are you going to move further along the
line or you are going to eventually? No,

31
00:01:41,380 --> 00:01:45,030
that would be once I stand for an
NP than I would at Glen. The Jacks,

32
00:01:45,031 --> 00:01:47,540
I don't know if you know Glenda Jackson,
she did this well on in shot.

33
00:01:47,550 --> 00:01:52,050
So like you know about him cause he went
away and then came back to the creative

34
00:01:52,051 --> 00:01:56,580
work that he was doing to doing films.
But he went away for seven years.

35
00:01:56,581 --> 00:02:01,290
So I will go away for a period of time
and put my career to hibernation and just

36
00:02:01,291 --> 00:02:02,840
do partings or two poachers.

37
00:02:02,910 --> 00:02:05,550
But you have a set period of time
where you're going to do this and then

38
00:02:05,551 --> 00:02:09,750
afterwards you're gonna retire. No,
I would do it. No set period of time.

39
00:02:09,751 --> 00:02:14,150
I just got and go off and for as
long as I can, as far as I can.

40
00:02:14,151 --> 00:02:17,430
And then I come back when I choose
to come. Oh No, stand up. No nothing.

41
00:02:17,431 --> 00:02:20,310
During that time you could do stand up
if you're raising money for charity.

42
00:02:20,311 --> 00:02:23,370
If I'm raising money for the
Labour Party, I party. Um,

43
00:02:23,371 --> 00:02:25,170
I think that would be allowable.

44
00:02:25,200 --> 00:02:28,670
I think my constituency members wouldn't
mind that if I was raising money for

45
00:02:28,680 --> 00:02:30,330
constituency.
Um,

46
00:02:30,360 --> 00:02:34,920
but if I was just doing it for myself
less, well you can write books,

47
00:02:34,921 --> 00:02:37,440
you'll have to write books and
the articles, it's all a bit hazy,

48
00:02:37,441 --> 00:02:41,470
but I'm not sure if you have the same
system in. We have a similar system. Uh,

49
00:02:41,520 --> 00:02:45,840
my friend Doug Stan hope was running for
president briefly kind of as a lark and

50
00:02:45,841 --> 00:02:49,860
uh, realized that he really couldn't
do stand up because if he did stand up,

51
00:02:49,861 --> 00:02:54,000
he would have to allow equal time for
everyone else who wanted to perform,

52
00:02:54,720 --> 00:02:56,700
who also had some,

53
00:02:56,701 --> 00:03:00,790
like his stand up performances were
then thought of as political campaign

54
00:03:01,210 --> 00:03:03,970
performances,
something along those lines.

55
00:03:03,970 --> 00:03:08,200
It was like some weird bullshit that he
was going to have to navigate that he

56
00:03:08,201 --> 00:03:12,550
decided to just back out of it. Yeah,
but he was bullshitting the entire time.

57
00:03:12,970 --> 00:03:16,690
We're just doing it for fun now. I ain't
going to do it. I ain't going to go in.

58
00:03:16,840 --> 00:03:19,900
I think a lot of moderate people don't
go and I consider myself a radical model.

59
00:03:19,901 --> 00:03:24,100
I do radicle things with the model of
message and they've already done a number

60
00:03:24,101 --> 00:03:26,980
of things like that and my life.
So I'm just going to take that in.

61
00:03:27,190 --> 00:03:29,200
And what's your goal?

62
00:03:29,620 --> 00:03:34,620
My goal is to try and encourage my
country in the world to go in a positive

63
00:03:34,691 --> 00:03:36,080
direction. I think, um,

64
00:03:36,190 --> 00:03:40,210
I've been saying this politically that I
think this is our last century on earth,

65
00:03:40,300 --> 00:03:43,930
or it's our first century on it.
I think next 80 years is for everything.

66
00:03:43,931 --> 00:03:45,130
We're going to choose everything here.

67
00:03:45,130 --> 00:03:47,500
We're either gonna wipe ourselves off
the planet or we're going to make it a

68
00:03:47,501 --> 00:03:51,360
fair world for 7.5 billion people where
you have a right to have a fair old

69
00:03:51,370 --> 00:03:55,750
enough democracy and transparency,
enough money to live a life,

70
00:03:55,751 --> 00:03:56,381
to have a family.

71
00:03:56,381 --> 00:04:00,550
Not everyone know billions of people
living on $1 a day or $2 a day.

72
00:04:00,580 --> 00:04:05,580
So I think we need to get to that
because then immigration raises its head,

73
00:04:05,921 --> 00:04:07,690
your country, my country,
every country in the world.

74
00:04:07,691 --> 00:04:10,210
And that's all people moving around
because they haven't got enough money to

75
00:04:10,211 --> 00:04:13,600
live on or they haven't got of security
because there's a war civil war.

76
00:04:14,230 --> 00:04:19,120
And if we could get beyond that, then a
lot of those problems drop away. So, but,

77
00:04:19,170 --> 00:04:23,500
and going into politics and talking
about a global vision of the future in

78
00:04:23,501 --> 00:04:24,910
whatever is,
is slightly,

79
00:04:25,630 --> 00:04:28,180
it's very difficult thing to do
because people couldn't say, Oh,

80
00:04:28,181 --> 00:04:31,240
you've just asked for that. How is
that helping this, this global vision?

81
00:04:31,241 --> 00:04:36,100
But I just thought we seem to be
trying 1930s politics again and,

82
00:04:36,101 --> 00:04:38,350
uh, in political area. So I
thought, well, I ain't gonna,

83
00:04:38,590 --> 00:04:41,050
I ain't gonna look for a vision,
a positive vision of the future.

84
00:04:41,051 --> 00:04:44,200
And I know when I came out as transgender
and I'd be fine if there was no way I

85
00:04:44,201 --> 00:04:47,050
could imagine anything.
I didn't know where it was going to go.

86
00:04:47,051 --> 00:04:49,870
I just thought I can need to go
out there and need to argue those,

87
00:04:50,020 --> 00:04:54,850
discuss at least try and set up a
positive image version, you know,

88
00:04:54,880 --> 00:04:59,680
cause uh, you, I don't care
what age you are, but I think
it was 51 51. So, you know,

89
00:04:59,681 --> 00:05:04,090
I'm 57. So remember the earlier years
of our lives, it was just so out there.

90
00:05:04,091 --> 00:05:05,860
Transgender,
you didn't talk about it.

91
00:05:06,200 --> 00:05:07,910
They were gay and lesbian
people out with transgender.

92
00:05:07,910 --> 00:05:11,410
It was like crazy out there and plays
well at that. Hell are you on about,

93
00:05:12,400 --> 00:05:16,840
and that's what it was when I came in
the middle of that. Yeah. It wasn't a,

94
00:05:17,320 --> 00:05:21,670
it wasn't a, an easy thing,
but I just thought, I'm not
going to do special forces.

95
00:05:21,671 --> 00:05:25,660
I'll do this. Civilians, there's
a hilarious group of choices,

96
00:05:26,230 --> 00:05:29,230
special forces or transgender,
what I did the,

97
00:05:29,231 --> 00:05:33,540
the civilians special forces to fight
on the streets in the audio people and

98
00:05:33,541 --> 00:05:35,930
yeah, and be, and it's all
mental, isn't it? If you're,

99
00:05:35,990 --> 00:05:40,130
if you're in a isn't any way the same
because people are shooting bullets at you

100
00:05:40,131 --> 00:05:41,560
in the end,
people are dying and getting blown up.

101
00:05:41,561 --> 00:05:45,040
So I know there's a massive difference
there, but everything in the end,

102
00:05:45,041 --> 00:05:48,970
it's psychological. And, um,
if I wasn't going to do that,

103
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:52,750
I'm just gonna try and do this,
and I would take risks in these areas of,

104
00:05:53,620 --> 00:05:54,850
of,
you know,

105
00:05:55,060 --> 00:05:58,160
I'll go out and people say things in the
street or whatever they do and do that,

106
00:05:58,161 --> 00:06:02,360
and then I'll run the math as though you
were going out knowing that you might

107
00:06:02,361 --> 00:06:06,530
have to be in an altercation. Yeah. I,
I'm was sure that was going to happen.

108
00:06:07,070 --> 00:06:10,450
Teenagers at this point and screaming.
Yeah.

109
00:06:10,840 --> 00:06:11,260
Okay.
