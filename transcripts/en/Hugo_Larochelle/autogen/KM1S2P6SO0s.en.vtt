00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.929
 in this capsule we will see a case 

00:00:02.159 --> 00:00:07.740
 particular dynamic Bezier networks 

00:00:03.929 --> 00:00:09.210
 that is to say the markov chain then 

00:00:07.740 --> 00:00:11.070
 a chain of markov 

00:00:09.210 --> 00:00:13.469
 so this is a special case the 

00:00:11.070 --> 00:00:16.650
 dynamic hobbesian and in this case one 

00:00:13.469 --> 00:00:19.590
 will mobilize a single series of 

00:00:16.650 --> 00:00:22.260
 random variables is and who anchors 

00:00:19.590 --> 00:00:25.680
 have been indexed or 1.10 by a small 

00:00:22.260 --> 00:00:27.900
 so in the Bézian networks a 

00:00:25.680 --> 00:00:30.599
 dynamic we saw the formulation the 

00:00:27.900 --> 00:00:33.120
 general until now has been excited 

00:00:30.599 --> 00:00:35.489
 and ed could correspond to a set 

00:00:33.120 --> 00:00:37.110
 of several laboratories in this case 

00:00:35.489 --> 00:00:38.190
 we see only one variable 

00:00:37.110 --> 00:00:40.260
 you go discreet he'll be always 

00:00:38.190 --> 00:00:42.180
 observed so it's a bit like 

00:00:40.260 --> 00:00:45.660
 did not have excitement and that tea 

00:00:42.180 --> 00:00:49.739
 was equal only a set that 

00:00:45.660 --> 00:00:52.379
 contained sst and how to see sometimes 

00:00:49.739 --> 00:00:54.690
 have particular connectivity 

00:00:52.379 --> 00:00:56.879
 associated with a chain of markov and we're going 

00:00:54.690 --> 00:00:58.739
 focus on the body first 

00:00:56.879 --> 00:01:03.840
 rank ie is quoted va 

00:00:58.739 --> 00:01:06.510
 depend only on st - and so 

00:01:03.840 --> 00:01:08.820
 often the field of deschênes de 

00:01:06.510 --> 00:01:10.610
 markov is going to be a finite domain that is going 

00:01:08.820 --> 00:01:13.080
 correspond to a set of symbol 

00:01:10.610 --> 00:01:15.360
 so that could be all of 

00:01:13.080 --> 00:01:16.770
 characters that could be typed or 

00:01:15.360 --> 00:01:18.119
 the set of words that we could 

00:01:16.770 --> 00:01:19.560
 write in a sentence 

00:01:18.119 --> 00:01:23.250
 so that will allow us to model 

00:01:19.560 --> 00:01:25.080
 either words starting as being a 

00:01:23.250 --> 00:01:27.750
 character sequence or phrases 

00:01:25.080 --> 00:01:30.299
 as being a sequence of world then 

00:01:27.750 --> 00:01:32.610
 to model this kind of observation there 

00:01:30.299 --> 00:01:36.329
 we will need to define a distribution 

00:01:32.610 --> 00:01:38.310
 a priori or initial on the first 

00:01:36.329 --> 00:01:41.579
 symbol ie the value of a 

00:01:38.310 --> 00:01:44.040
 laboratory s1 and then two years will have 

00:01:41.579 --> 00:01:46.079
 need a table of probabilities 

00:01:44.040 --> 00:01:48.659
 conditionalities that can be seen under the 

00:01:46.079 --> 00:01:50.640
 form of a matrix in fact so who is going 

00:01:48.659 --> 00:01:52.829
 give us the probity values ​​of the 

00:01:50.640 --> 00:01:55.530
 value of the slaughterhouses share where you have some 

00:01:52.829 --> 00:01:58.590
 blue would therefore be incited +1 being 

00:01:55.530 --> 00:02:02.570
 given the variable the value of the 

00:01:58.590 --> 00:02:02.570
 variable at the time where at the instant t 

00:02:03.110 --> 00:02:08.160
 then the graphic illustration 

00:02:05.479 --> 00:02:10.800
 corresponding either here we have our 

00:02:08.160 --> 00:02:15.270
 first random variable is healthy 

00:02:10.800 --> 00:02:18.210
 who she is going to have as finally s 2 and 

00:02:15.270 --> 00:02:21.300
 so on until any 

00:02:18.210 --> 00:02:23.760
 variable is quoted is quoted from 

00:02:21.300 --> 00:02:25.230
 sites and we will ask that is quoted 

00:02:23.760 --> 00:02:26.400
 highest was generated only at 

00:02:25.230 --> 00:02:28.920
 from st 

00:02:26.400 --> 00:02:32.160
 and so on until the last 

00:02:28.920 --> 00:02:34.770
 random variable of my sequence of 

00:02:32.160 --> 00:02:36.750
 grown ground in this case 

00:02:34.770 --> 00:02:40.080
 would model for example a 

00:02:36.750 --> 00:02:42.750
 word that has a great tea character and s1 

00:02:40.080 --> 00:02:45.060
 corresponded to the first characters s2 

00:02:42.750 --> 00:02:47.010
 the second character instituted the same 

00:02:45.060 --> 00:02:48.390
 way to and model August sentences 

00:02:47.010 --> 00:02:50.430
 and that would be the length of the sentence 

00:02:48.390 --> 00:02:52.920
 and then is a it would be the first word s 

00:02:50.430 --> 00:02:54.570
 of evidence second to institutes and the 

00:02:52.920 --> 00:02:57.120
 the assumption we make is that the 

00:02:54.570 --> 00:02:59.730
 way it's carey these words where these 

00:02:57.120 --> 00:03:02.490
 sentences were generated is that the 

00:02:59.730 --> 00:03:04.740
 first his demon colt the first 

00:03:02.490 --> 00:03:06.390
 character been generated in this chosen 200th 

00:03:04.740 --> 00:03:08.280
 the second character to put in 

00:03:06.390 --> 00:03:11.640
 our not only from the first 

00:03:08.280 --> 00:03:13.200
 character next of that the third 

00:03:11.640 --> 00:03:16.050
 quarter actors were generated but just 

00:03:13.200 --> 00:03:17.910
 without considering the second character and 

00:03:16.050 --> 00:03:20.520
 so on until the last 

00:03:17.910 --> 00:03:22.140
 character of my taste so that's 

00:03:20.520 --> 00:03:23.850
 the illustration of the bezier network in the 

00:03:22.140 --> 00:03:26.570
 case one would have a finite chain of 

00:03:23.850 --> 00:03:26.570
 symbol 

00:03:27.620 --> 00:03:35.820
 and as we saw in a Bézian network 

00:03:30.900 --> 00:03:37.590
 the probability for everything but variable 

00:03:35.820 --> 00:03:39.420
 so all minors it's just the 

00:03:37.590 --> 00:03:42.709
 product to enjoy all the nodes 

00:03:39.420 --> 00:03:45.150
 his warmth by a gift for the first 

00:03:42.709 --> 00:03:46.080
 for the first one if there is no 

00:03:45.150 --> 00:03:48.720
 parents so this is a proof 

00:03:46.080 --> 00:03:51.120
 imagination and made it the 

00:03:48.720 --> 00:03:55.110
 produces variables is quoted for 

00:03:51.120 --> 00:03:57.480
 is equal to 2 up to grant and incite 

00:03:55.110 --> 00:03:58.950
 sasha are parents because if we have a 

00:03:57.480 --> 00:04:01.290
 only parent in our Beziers network 

00:03:58.950 --> 00:04:03.120
 in the chain of mark up and cst less 

00:04:01.290 --> 00:04:05.670
 well so that's for a channel 

00:04:03.120 --> 00:04:08.370
 markov of first order and if we had 

00:04:05.670 --> 00:04:12.180
 a second-order mark up chain usd 

00:04:08.370 --> 00:04:14.940
 - until st - 2 the third man whose 

00:04:12.180 --> 00:04:19.560
 success is less 1 st - 2 st - 3 

00:04:14.940 --> 00:04:22.140
 is instituted and therefore in this 

00:04:19.560 --> 00:04:23.610
 distribution the the initial distribution 

00:04:22.140 --> 00:04:26.470
 we see it here 

00:04:23.610 --> 00:04:28.030
 then the transition model that's me 

00:04:26.470 --> 00:04:35.230
 given by the same amateur of probity 

00:04:28.030 --> 00:04:37.000
 conditional that's it here another 

00:04:35.230 --> 00:04:38.470
 alternative illustration is that 

00:04:37.000 --> 00:04:42.130
 in the form of an automaton 

00:04:38.470 --> 00:04:43.450
 finished so I will not use it often 

00:04:42.130 --> 00:04:45.670
 but I ride it because sometimes 

00:04:43.450 --> 00:04:47.680
 when we are articles because we 

00:04:45.670 --> 00:04:50.560
 guard during these applications use 

00:04:47.680 --> 00:04:52.900
 Markov chains is sometimes there 

00:04:50.560 --> 00:04:55.720
 the illustration that visualization 

00:04:52.900 --> 00:04:58.810
 of a markov chain which is used 

00:04:55.720 --> 00:05:00.580
 practicing role to think in the 

00:04:58.810 --> 00:05:03.210
 influential code of symbols unleashed 

00:05:00.580 --> 00:05:06.550
 finished it's the same it loses maybe 

00:05:03.210 --> 00:05:09.160
 contradictory finish infinite 6 may 

00:05:06.550 --> 00:05:12.340
 automata finish in the direction and has 

00:05:09.160 --> 00:05:14.050
 finished ok so that is to say that my 

00:05:12.340 --> 00:05:17.770
 variable can take a number 

00:05:14.050 --> 00:05:19.510
 possible values ​​and this number of 

00:05:17.770 --> 00:05:23.050
 values ​​there the domain finally of my 

00:05:19.510 --> 00:05:26.080
 variable is quoted is over we can 

00:05:23.050 --> 00:05:27.640
 present in a matrix form that 

00:05:26.080 --> 00:05:31.180
 basically gives the table 

00:05:27.640 --> 00:05:34.450
 proof of the conditional so in fact by 

00:05:31.180 --> 00:05:39.550
 example this column ci corresponds to the 

00:05:34.450 --> 00:05:41.620
 probability of st +1 this is gala to ab 

00:05:39.550 --> 00:05:44.610
 houacine one arises if the tale to three 

00:05:41.620 --> 00:05:48.250
 possible symbols on bsi sensors 

00:05:44.610 --> 00:05:50.890
 given the value of the sites and therefore 

00:05:48.250 --> 00:05:53.440
 in this case it has projected bored if 

00:05:50.890 --> 00:05:55.900
 we suppose that it was a pain we will have the 

00:05:53.440 --> 00:05:59.260
 proof 10.7 which is his either gala to 

00:05:55.900 --> 00:06:00.970
 point of time is no longer a penny equal to 

00:05:59.260 --> 00:06:04.180
 behold point that it was more one be 

00:06:00.970 --> 00:06:05.530
 equal to 6 same thing for being given 

00:06:04.180 --> 00:06:07.930
 that they were guys the abbot was going 

00:06:05.530 --> 00:06:10.810
 take advantage of at b and c could quote +1 

00:06:07.930 --> 00:06:12.460
 institute then sometimes presents them with 

00:06:10.810 --> 00:06:14.530
 graphically in the form of 

00:06:12.460 --> 00:06:15.700
 the automaton then ends up in this case the 

00:06:14.530 --> 00:06:18.340
 was not random variables 

00:06:15.700 --> 00:06:20.590
 but it's a possible value of the 

00:06:18.340 --> 00:06:23.800
 variable is one and the cards 

00:06:20.590 --> 00:06:28.900
 corresponded sta transition is more 

00:06:23.800 --> 00:06:30.520
 so to generate my chain 

00:06:28.900 --> 00:06:33.670
 marks have done simply 

00:06:30.520 --> 00:06:36.020
 transition between states where by 

00:06:33.670 --> 00:06:37.849
 example could start at 1 

00:06:36.020 --> 00:06:39.289
 and when that indicates that the figures 

00:06:37.849 --> 00:06:41.960
 for the arrows to corresponds to the 

00:06:39.289 --> 00:06:43.789
 probability of taking this doing this 

00:06:41.960 --> 00:06:46.220
 transition the dance that if we have a 

00:06:43.789 --> 00:06:49.430
 quality 2.2 from haste to get to 

00:06:46.220 --> 00:06:53.389
 b what the probability here we have a pro 

00:06:49.430 --> 00:06:58.180
 liter 2.7 to stay at 1 what is done 

00:06:53.389 --> 00:07:03.530
 here a probity 2.1 to go to these 

00:06:58.180 --> 00:07:05.210
 who is here so in what if doing 

00:07:03.530 --> 00:07:08.240
 stochastic routes like that to 

00:07:05.210 --> 00:07:10.310
 through this automaton ends up there 

00:07:08.240 --> 00:07:11.960
 would correspond to the process of generating 

00:07:10.310 --> 00:07:14.210
 strings of my character's 

00:07:11.960 --> 00:07:17.810
 markov machines a huge youth 

00:07:14.210 --> 00:07:18.590
 oaks that could be generated cccb ppp 

00:07:17.810 --> 00:07:21.319
 is 8 

00:07:18.590 --> 00:07:23.810
 I would answer you is pretty stay pretty 

00:07:21.319 --> 00:07:26.360
 once then go down to ab stays at 

00:07:23.810 --> 00:07:30.169
 well once our fourth times 

00:07:26.360 --> 00:07:32.229
 times to those already gone to a and so of 

00:07:30.169 --> 00:07:32.229
 after
