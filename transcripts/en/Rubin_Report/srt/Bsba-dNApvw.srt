00:00:00,780 --> 00:00:03,420
What is a classical liberal,
it sounds like someone who's a liberal,

2
00:00:03,421 --> 00:00:06,300
but perhaps a bit fancier,
maybe sporting a top hat,

3
00:00:06,330 --> 00:00:09,030
a twirly mustache and a monocle to time.
Oh,

4
00:00:09,031 --> 00:00:11,220
that might be true in some specific cases.

5
00:00:11,250 --> 00:00:14,370
There's a lot more to it than that and
I bet I can convince you that there is a

6
00:00:14,371 --> 00:00:17,430
little classical liberal in
youtube in about two minutes.

7
00:00:18,810 --> 00:00:23,040
Classical liberalism is the idea that
individual freedom and limited government

8
00:00:23,041 --> 00:00:25,740
or the best way for humans
to form a free society.

9
00:00:26,070 --> 00:00:29,820
The classical liberal tradition was born
from great thinkers such as John Locke,

10
00:00:29,850 --> 00:00:32,700
Adam Smith, John Stuart
Mill, and Thomas Jefferson.

11
00:00:33,180 --> 00:00:37,080
While they off tinkered in their own way
with the ideas of classical liberalism,

12
00:00:37,290 --> 00:00:41,430
the core belief that the individual should
always be considered above the group

13
00:00:41,760 --> 00:00:42,990
always remained constant.

14
00:00:43,410 --> 00:00:48,410
Thomas Jefferson even threw in the pursuit
of happiness in the constitution to

15
00:00:48,451 --> 00:00:51,900
drive home the point that your happiness
wasn't the governments to give,

16
00:00:52,230 --> 00:00:55,440
but rather yours to take.
What do we individual above.

17
00:00:55,441 --> 00:00:58,860
The group not only empowers you
to live your life as you see fit,

18
00:00:58,920 --> 00:01:03,920
but it also neutralizes the forces of
racism and bigotry which judge people not

19
00:01:04,051 --> 00:01:07,890
on their individuality, but on their
immutable group characteristics.

20
00:01:08,120 --> 00:01:11,730
Be it color of skin, gender,
or sexuality. These days,

21
00:01:11,731 --> 00:01:15,480
liberalism has been confused
with leftism or progressivism,

22
00:01:15,481 --> 00:01:19,020
which actually has nothing to
do with classical liberalism.

23
00:01:21,720 --> 00:01:22,171
Sadly,

24
00:01:22,171 --> 00:01:26,430
the left is no longer in liberal at
all for his traded in individualism for

25
00:01:26,431 --> 00:01:27,264
collectivism.

26
00:01:27,570 --> 00:01:31,950
Thus placing us in an oppression
Olympics where victimhood is virtue.

27
00:01:32,310 --> 00:01:33,660
This postmodernism,

28
00:01:33,661 --> 00:01:38,310
this cultural Marxism or whatever you
wanna call it and can only destroy it,

29
00:01:38,311 --> 00:01:39,144
cannot create.

30
00:01:39,510 --> 00:01:43,770
If you buck the trend and dare succeed
as a member of one of these supposed

31
00:01:43,771 --> 00:01:44,850
oppressed minorities,

32
00:01:45,060 --> 00:01:50,060
you must be tossed aside because your
success is confirmation of the failure of

33
00:01:50,461 --> 00:01:53,880
this worldview.
This is what the left is offering,

34
00:01:54,270 --> 00:01:58,040
and that's not classically liberal.
It's radically illiberal.

35
00:01:58,800 --> 00:02:02,580
So it doesn't matter if you're liberal
or conservative or libertarian or an

36
00:02:02,581 --> 00:02:06,030
independent. It doesn't matter if
you're a Christian or an atheist,

37
00:02:06,031 --> 00:02:08,040
a man or a woman who are black or white.

38
00:02:08,400 --> 00:02:12,300
What matters is whether you wish to
live as a free person in a free society

39
00:02:12,301 --> 00:02:17,220
based on your own ideas and action. I
suspect that you do, and if I'm right,

40
00:02:17,430 --> 00:02:20,490
there's already a little classical
liberal in you right now.
