00:00:03.250 --> 00:00:04.130
- Good afternoon.

00:00:04.130 --> 00:00:06.070
My name is Immaculata
De Vivo, and I

00:00:06.070 --> 00:00:09.430
am the Interim Co-director for
Science Programming this year

00:00:09.430 --> 00:00:11.260
for the life sciences.

00:00:11.260 --> 00:00:14.170
And I am delighted
and privileged to be

00:00:14.170 --> 00:00:16.750
introducing our speakers today.

00:00:16.750 --> 00:00:20.950
The lecture is entitled
"Science Sounds Strange,"

00:00:20.950 --> 00:00:23.950
and it's actually the first
lecture in the Undiscovered

00:00:23.950 --> 00:00:26.050
Science Series.

00:00:26.050 --> 00:00:31.270
The Undiscovered Series,
or the actual conference,

00:00:31.270 --> 00:00:33.520
will be held on October 26.

00:00:33.520 --> 00:00:37.540
And the conference itself
showcases the critical role

00:00:37.540 --> 00:00:41.760
of unexpected or unforeseeable
discovery in science.

00:00:41.760 --> 00:00:47.570
And my co-partner, Lisa Goodman,
this was her brainchild.

00:00:47.570 --> 00:00:50.830
The goal of that day is to
gather not only scientists

00:00:50.830 --> 00:00:52.810
but educators, students,
and journalists,

00:00:52.810 --> 00:00:55.210
media producers,
and others to start

00:00:55.210 --> 00:00:58.390
a new, very public conversation
about how scientists

00:00:58.390 --> 00:01:01.090
should make discoveries.

00:01:01.090 --> 00:01:04.000
Today, I am privileged
to present Professor John

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:07.360
Huth, who is a Donner
Professor of Science

00:01:07.360 --> 00:01:10.240
in the Department of Physics
here at Harvard University.

00:01:10.240 --> 00:01:13.840
He served as the faculty
co-director of science

00:01:13.840 --> 00:01:16.540
at this Institute, at
Radcliffe, and he works mainly

00:01:16.540 --> 00:01:19.960
in the field of experimental
particle physics.

00:01:19.960 --> 00:01:25.330
I also would like to introduce
our thereminist, Dorit

00:01:25.330 --> 00:01:27.450
Chrysler, who's sitting
in the front row.

00:01:27.450 --> 00:01:29.680
She's an Austrian-born
thereminist.

00:01:29.680 --> 00:01:32.530
She's a composer,
producer, and singer.

00:01:32.530 --> 00:01:36.850
And her focus is to promote the
theremin in contemporary music.

00:01:36.850 --> 00:01:39.550
I actually did a
little research myself

00:01:39.550 --> 00:01:41.620
so that I wouldn't
sound too foolish today.

00:01:41.620 --> 00:01:43.509
And I found out
that this instrument

00:01:43.509 --> 00:01:45.550
is one of the only
instruments that can be played

00:01:45.550 --> 00:01:47.180
without actually touching it.

00:01:47.180 --> 00:01:49.270
So yes.

00:01:49.270 --> 00:01:52.060
She's also the founder of
the New York Theremin Society

00:01:52.060 --> 00:01:53.830
and started America's
first school

00:01:53.830 --> 00:01:56.920
for theremin,
KidCoolThereminSchool.

00:01:56.920 --> 00:01:59.710
She has performed with the San
Francisco Symphony Orchestra

00:01:59.710 --> 00:02:02.410
and is featured on the
soundtrack of the HBO

00:02:02.410 --> 00:02:04.890
documentary, Going Clear.

00:02:04.890 --> 00:02:08.770
She's been commissioned for
MoMA in the Venice Biennial,

00:02:08.770 --> 00:02:14.480
and she's performed at Lincoln
Center, Vienna, Coachella--

00:02:14.480 --> 00:02:18.970
just a whole variety
of different venues.

00:02:18.970 --> 00:02:23.090
And I guess,
without further ado,

00:02:23.090 --> 00:02:27.820
I'd like to present Professor
John Huth to the podium.

00:02:27.820 --> 00:02:28.766
Thank you.

00:02:28.766 --> 00:02:32.550
[APPLAUSE]

00:02:34.900 --> 00:02:35.400
- OK.

00:02:35.400 --> 00:02:36.420
Well, welcome.

00:02:36.420 --> 00:02:39.990
Actually, Dorit is the
main speaker and performer

00:02:39.990 --> 00:02:41.730
on the theremin.

00:02:41.730 --> 00:02:44.100
So the way we're going
to do it is Dorit's going

00:02:44.100 --> 00:02:47.680
to come up, explain the
theremin a little bit,

00:02:47.680 --> 00:02:52.170
perform some pieces, and also
talk about the amazing and odd

00:02:52.170 --> 00:02:54.810
life of Leo Theremin.

00:02:54.810 --> 00:02:57.120
And at some moment,
she'll ask me to come up,

00:02:57.120 --> 00:03:00.060
and I'll give you some of the
physical principles underlying

00:03:00.060 --> 00:03:04.110
the performance of the theremin
and some of the espionage work

00:03:04.110 --> 00:03:06.760
that Theremin was engaged in.

00:03:06.760 --> 00:03:07.944
So Dorit.

00:03:07.944 --> 00:03:11.840
[APPLAUSE]

00:03:17.210 --> 00:03:18.110
- Thank you, John.

00:03:18.110 --> 00:03:21.230
Thank you for having me.

00:03:21.230 --> 00:03:25.640
Some years ago, I was invited
at a friend's house in New York.

00:03:25.640 --> 00:03:29.390
And he pointed me
towards a very unassuming

00:03:29.390 --> 00:03:38.660
looking object consisting of
a wooden box with a metal rod.

00:03:38.660 --> 00:03:40.350
Some power was plugged in.

00:03:40.350 --> 00:03:44.960
And then suddenly, I heard
a really unusual and strange

00:03:44.960 --> 00:03:50.090
sound that seemed to
correlate with the slightest

00:03:50.090 --> 00:03:52.760
motion of my body.

00:03:52.760 --> 00:03:59.540
And I was instantly smitten
and surprised that I had never

00:03:59.540 --> 00:04:02.930
heard about this
device that turned out

00:04:02.930 --> 00:04:05.210
to be a music instrument.

00:04:05.210 --> 00:04:09.210
And I wanted to find
out, how does it work?

00:04:09.210 --> 00:04:11.270
How can it be played?

00:04:11.270 --> 00:04:16.380
And why is this instrument
not more popular?

00:04:16.380 --> 00:04:20.300
So this was my first
encounter with the theremin.

00:04:20.300 --> 00:04:22.370
And I would like
to know who of you

00:04:22.370 --> 00:04:25.790
here has ever played
a theremin before?

00:04:25.790 --> 00:04:27.680
OK.

00:04:27.680 --> 00:04:33.140
We have a few arms-- about
10, which is not bad.

00:04:33.140 --> 00:04:36.310
But it should be more.

00:04:36.310 --> 00:04:37.780
[LAUGHTER]

00:04:37.780 --> 00:04:40.890
- [INAUDIBLE]

00:04:40.890 --> 00:04:41.520
- OK.

00:04:41.520 --> 00:04:42.300
Yeah.

00:04:42.300 --> 00:04:47.495
The theremin really came
to life by accident.

00:04:50.250 --> 00:04:52.610
It was invented-- created--

00:04:52.610 --> 00:04:57.320
by a Russian physicist,
Lev Theremin.

00:04:57.320 --> 00:05:01.070
He was working at the time
at the Physical Technical

00:05:01.070 --> 00:05:03.440
Institute in St. Petersburg.

00:05:03.440 --> 00:05:06.380
And he was working
on the principle

00:05:06.380 --> 00:05:10.340
of one of the first
motion detector systems.

00:05:10.340 --> 00:05:13.760
And he actually
created an alarm system

00:05:13.760 --> 00:05:17.480
that was installed
at the Moscow Bank,

00:05:17.480 --> 00:05:20.480
and it's based on a principle
that, then, John later

00:05:20.480 --> 00:05:25.430
will more elaborately
explain to all of us.

00:05:25.430 --> 00:05:30.730
All I can do is demonstrate this
alarm system that he created--

00:05:30.730 --> 00:05:33.680
just basically created
the electromagnetic field

00:05:33.680 --> 00:05:34.570
and the body.

00:05:37.265 --> 00:05:41.260
[ELECTRONIC WHIRRING NOISE]

00:05:41.260 --> 00:05:43.750
Approaching a certain
distance, the body

00:05:43.750 --> 00:05:47.005
is a conductor
changing the frequency

00:05:47.005 --> 00:05:51.640
and creating a sound
in the audible range.

00:05:51.640 --> 00:05:53.860
When he worked on this
in the laboratory,

00:05:53.860 --> 00:05:56.560
strange noises emerged.

00:05:56.560 --> 00:06:00.370
And because Lev Theremin
also was a cellist,

00:06:00.370 --> 00:06:04.570
he had the idea to turn
this principle into a music

00:06:04.570 --> 00:06:08.385
instrument, hence the theremin.

00:06:11.120 --> 00:06:13.970
The theremin, of course,
is a completely different

00:06:13.970 --> 00:06:17.750
musical interface than all
the traditional instruments.

00:06:17.750 --> 00:06:19.850
And that, and for
many other reasons,

00:06:19.850 --> 00:06:23.600
it really had problems
establishing itself.

00:06:23.600 --> 00:06:27.350
It's also extremely hard
to play because it responds

00:06:27.350 --> 00:06:29.750
to the slightest
motion of the body,

00:06:29.750 --> 00:06:32.960
even when you think
you're not moving.

00:06:32.960 --> 00:06:34.940
You still are
constantly in motion,

00:06:34.940 --> 00:06:36.500
and it changes the pitch.

00:06:36.500 --> 00:06:41.930
When you play theremin, you
really dive into micro-space.

00:06:41.930 --> 00:06:46.400
Because of this invention-- it
was the era of electrification

00:06:46.400 --> 00:06:48.350
in the Soviet Union.

00:06:48.350 --> 00:06:52.670
It was 1919, meaning the
theremin is turning 100

00:06:52.670 --> 00:06:53.960
next year.

00:06:53.960 --> 00:06:58.450
And he became a prodigy of
Lenin with this instrument.

00:06:58.450 --> 00:07:00.410
There's a nice photo
where Lenin himself

00:07:00.410 --> 00:07:02.210
is playing the theremin.

00:07:02.210 --> 00:07:05.540
And he was sent across
Europe to promote

00:07:05.540 --> 00:07:10.040
the technical
achievements of Russia.

00:07:10.040 --> 00:07:13.130
And he made it all
the way to New York.

00:07:13.130 --> 00:07:17.400
And there, he had
his first review--

00:07:17.400 --> 00:07:20.960
1927-- by The New York Times.

00:07:20.960 --> 00:07:26.450
There was a headline that
said "Ether Wave Music Amazes

00:07:26.450 --> 00:07:27.740
Savants."

00:07:27.740 --> 00:07:31.150
And it featured an
interview by Lev Theremin

00:07:31.150 --> 00:07:33.230
where he quotes verbatim--

00:07:33.230 --> 00:07:37.220
very humbly-- he
says, "My apparatus

00:07:37.220 --> 00:07:43.190
will liberate the
composer of the despotism

00:07:43.190 --> 00:07:47.240
of the well-tempered
12-tone piano scale.

00:07:47.240 --> 00:07:52.910
It offers infinite tonal
possibility and literally

00:07:52.910 --> 00:07:56.710
thousands of tone colors."

00:07:56.710 --> 00:08:01.280
To give you now a possibility
to make your own impression,

00:08:01.280 --> 00:08:05.480
I will perform one of the
pieces that Lev performed

00:08:05.480 --> 00:08:08.390
that time, one of the
pieces of his repertoire,

00:08:08.390 --> 00:08:09.665
so you can hear for yourself.

00:08:23.483 --> 00:08:27.475
[MUSIC - CAMILLE SAINT SAENS,
 "THE SWAN"]

00:11:42.584 --> 00:11:46.576
[APPLAUSE]

00:11:51.860 --> 00:11:54.320
As you can see, one really
has to concentrate and hold

00:11:54.320 --> 00:11:55.520
the body very still.

00:11:55.520 --> 00:11:59.270
And just two days ago, when
we did something like this,

00:11:59.270 --> 00:12:02.120
I was criticized because people
want to know, how do you really

00:12:02.120 --> 00:12:02.620
play this?

00:12:02.620 --> 00:12:06.770
So I'm just going to give
a very fast explanation.

00:12:06.770 --> 00:12:10.140
So you might have noticed
this is the pitch antenna.

00:12:10.140 --> 00:12:12.730
So the closer my hand goes
to the pitch antenna--

00:12:12.730 --> 00:12:14.590
[ELECTRONIC NOTE PLAYING]

00:12:14.590 --> 00:12:16.270
--the higher the note.

00:12:16.270 --> 00:12:19.090
And this is the volume antenna.

00:12:19.090 --> 00:12:23.230
So the further away, the louder.

00:12:23.230 --> 00:12:26.470
And when I have my hand just
above the antenna, it's quiet.

00:12:26.470 --> 00:12:30.430
So it's an interplay
of the horizontal

00:12:30.430 --> 00:12:32.650
and the vertical fields.

00:12:32.650 --> 00:12:38.800
And each note is sculpted in
the air by the volume and tenor

00:12:38.800 --> 00:12:43.120
while I'm constantly
intonating and balancing,

00:12:43.120 --> 00:12:45.940
as if I'm buzzing
around the flower.

00:12:45.940 --> 00:12:46.790
That's the pitch.

00:12:46.790 --> 00:12:48.400
And my hand is a
bumblebee, and I'm

00:12:48.400 --> 00:12:53.170
trying to land on that
flower to get the pitch.

00:12:53.170 --> 00:12:55.867
That's the basic
approach on the theremin.

00:12:55.867 --> 00:12:57.450
I just want to talk
a little bit more.

00:12:57.450 --> 00:13:00.130
So Lev Theremin
came to New York,

00:13:00.130 --> 00:13:03.860
and he made quite a splash
with this new device.

00:13:03.860 --> 00:13:06.310
And even though the
theremin, at that time,

00:13:06.310 --> 00:13:09.130
was only applied to
classical music, which

00:13:09.130 --> 00:13:14.050
really limited its
tonal abilities,

00:13:14.050 --> 00:13:16.340
people still were very excited.

00:13:16.340 --> 00:13:20.230
And he found some sponsors
and started his laboratory

00:13:20.230 --> 00:13:21.880
in Manhattan.

00:13:21.880 --> 00:13:25.660
And he also had the
great luck to find

00:13:25.660 --> 00:13:30.520
a tremendously talented theremin
virtuoso, Clara Rockmore.

00:13:30.520 --> 00:13:33.130
She was a violinist
who injured her hand

00:13:33.130 --> 00:13:35.440
and couldn't play
the violin anymore.

00:13:35.440 --> 00:13:39.670
And she became a
proficient thereminist that

00:13:39.670 --> 00:13:42.580
really set the bar
very high of what

00:13:42.580 --> 00:13:44.830
is possible on this instrument.

00:13:44.830 --> 00:13:50.350
She then did a lot of tours
with Paul Robeson, activist

00:13:50.350 --> 00:13:51.440
and baritone.

00:13:51.440 --> 00:13:54.030
And if I could go
back in time, I

00:13:54.030 --> 00:13:58.280
would really probably choose
being at one of their concerts

00:13:58.280 --> 00:13:58.780
back then.

00:13:58.780 --> 00:14:02.830
I think that would have been
really, really exciting.

00:14:02.830 --> 00:14:07.510
Theremin sold his patent
for the theremin to RCA.

00:14:07.510 --> 00:14:13.450
So that made the theremin the
very first electric instrument

00:14:13.450 --> 00:14:16.540
that was actually
mass manufactured.

00:14:16.540 --> 00:14:21.460
So it was really the
birth of electronic music.

00:14:21.460 --> 00:14:26.740
The only problem was that
RCA marketed the theremin not

00:14:26.740 --> 00:14:32.020
really in a very successful
and realistic way.

00:14:32.020 --> 00:14:35.500
The theremin was certainly
a luxury item, price-wise.

00:14:35.500 --> 00:14:41.680
And they promoted it as a
friendly house instrument,

00:14:41.680 --> 00:14:48.850
easy to play for
the whole family,

00:14:48.850 --> 00:14:53.350
in the same note
like the home organs.

00:14:53.350 --> 00:14:58.720
And obviously, that proved
to be fatally wrong.

00:14:58.720 --> 00:15:01.380
In addition, there
was the Black Friday.

00:15:01.380 --> 00:15:04.160
The economic crashed.

00:15:04.160 --> 00:15:06.350
So that didn't help
things, either.

00:15:06.350 --> 00:15:11.620
And Theremin found himself
suddenly in tremendous debt.

00:15:11.620 --> 00:15:15.110
And he had himself
established in New York.

00:15:15.110 --> 00:15:18.040
He had married
one of the members

00:15:18.040 --> 00:15:21.620
of the first African-American
ballet troops.

00:15:21.620 --> 00:15:24.370
And suddenly, he was gone.

00:15:24.370 --> 00:15:26.330
And there are many rumors.

00:15:26.330 --> 00:15:28.900
There's one book
and one documentary,

00:15:28.900 --> 00:15:31.690
and there are different
accounts of claiming

00:15:31.690 --> 00:15:36.460
that he had been a spy
all along for Russia

00:15:36.460 --> 00:15:38.710
and chose to go back.

00:15:38.710 --> 00:15:42.940
And others say he was
kidnapped by the KGB.

00:15:42.940 --> 00:15:45.460
We don't know what happened.

00:15:45.460 --> 00:15:47.200
His wife in the
States didn't know.

00:15:47.200 --> 00:15:49.340
He was just suddenly gone.

00:15:49.340 --> 00:15:52.870
And we do know that--

00:15:52.870 --> 00:15:55.710
Stalin was in
power at that time.

00:15:55.710 --> 00:15:59.500
And he was first sent to
Siberia and then ended

00:15:59.500 --> 00:16:03.820
in one of those
notorious science camps.

00:16:03.820 --> 00:16:07.000
His whole family didn't
think he was alive anymore.

00:16:07.000 --> 00:16:12.710
And he worked on technical
devices benefiting the state.

00:16:12.710 --> 00:16:17.590
And interesting enough,
he applied the principle

00:16:17.590 --> 00:16:24.430
of this instrument also for
another new electronic device,

00:16:24.430 --> 00:16:25.925
namely the bug--

00:16:25.925 --> 00:16:26.425
"The Thing."

00:16:29.120 --> 00:16:36.150
A seal was given by children
to the American Ambassador,

00:16:36.150 --> 00:16:39.220
and he hung it right
behind his desk.

00:16:39.220 --> 00:16:43.120
And thanks to Theremin's
listening device

00:16:43.120 --> 00:16:46.620
that didn't exist until then,
the Russians could listen

00:16:46.620 --> 00:16:51.100
into all conversations for
many years until the British

00:16:51.100 --> 00:16:52.360
detected a signal.

00:16:52.360 --> 00:16:53.950
And there's a very
nice photo when

00:16:53.950 --> 00:16:56.440
the UN declared the Cold War.

00:16:56.440 --> 00:16:59.590
They're actually holding up
this very seal that contained

00:16:59.590 --> 00:17:01.750
the bug that Lev Theremin made.

00:17:01.750 --> 00:17:03.910
And so maybe at
this point, I would

00:17:03.910 --> 00:17:07.000
like to ask the esteemed
John Huth onstage

00:17:07.000 --> 00:17:11.868
to explain the technical
details of all these.

00:17:11.868 --> 00:17:12.368
- Thank you.

00:17:12.368 --> 00:17:15.812
[APPLAUSE]

00:17:17.300 --> 00:17:20.940
So Dorit will come up
and talk some more.

00:17:20.940 --> 00:17:24.530
But I'll try to explain as
best I can some of the science

00:17:24.530 --> 00:17:27.980
between both the
theremin and the bug.

00:17:27.980 --> 00:17:32.510
So most people probably
know that like charges

00:17:32.510 --> 00:17:35.785
repel in electromagnetism,
and unlike charges attract.

00:17:35.785 --> 00:17:38.030
So a plus-minus charge
will attract each other.

00:17:38.030 --> 00:17:40.790
A plus charge and a plus
charge will repel each other.

00:17:40.790 --> 00:17:44.310
And a minus charge and a minus
charge will repel each other.

00:17:44.310 --> 00:17:49.070
So in our bodies, our bodies
are, to some approximation,

00:17:49.070 --> 00:17:49.820
saline.

00:17:49.820 --> 00:17:51.450
That means it's salt water.

00:17:51.450 --> 00:17:52.880
And that means
charges can freely

00:17:52.880 --> 00:17:55.350
flow throughout our bodies.

00:17:55.350 --> 00:17:58.190
So if I take a charge
and put it on, let's say,

00:17:58.190 --> 00:18:00.680
the pitch antenna-- say I put
a bunch of positive charges

00:18:00.680 --> 00:18:02.420
on the pitch antenna--

00:18:02.420 --> 00:18:04.310
the negative charges
in my body are

00:18:04.310 --> 00:18:07.160
going to be attracted
toward the pitch antenna.

00:18:07.160 --> 00:18:09.970
And the positive charges
are going to get repelled.

00:18:09.970 --> 00:18:12.620
Because the positive charge
here repels the positive charges

00:18:12.620 --> 00:18:15.770
in my body and attracts
the negative charges.

00:18:15.770 --> 00:18:20.600
And what that does is it creates
a kind of natural device,

00:18:20.600 --> 00:18:23.180
if you like, called a capacitor.

00:18:23.180 --> 00:18:26.600
A capacitor is simply a
device that holds charge.

00:18:26.600 --> 00:18:29.480
This was done by,
among other people,

00:18:29.480 --> 00:18:32.030
Ben Franklin, who created
this in a Leyden jar, who

00:18:32.030 --> 00:18:36.620
was able to store the charge
from the base of a thundercloud

00:18:36.620 --> 00:18:39.320
with a kite to try to figure
out whether there were

00:18:39.320 --> 00:18:42.590
positive or negative charges at
the base of the thundercloud.

00:18:42.590 --> 00:18:47.300
So the circuit
that's used to get

00:18:47.300 --> 00:18:51.890
both the pitch and the volume
involves the following process.

00:18:51.890 --> 00:18:54.540
There's another device
inside here called

00:18:54.540 --> 00:18:56.390
an inductor, which
sometimes looks

00:18:56.390 --> 00:18:59.170
like a little spring wound up.

00:18:59.170 --> 00:19:04.130
And that has a property similar
to holding electric charge.

00:19:04.130 --> 00:19:07.020
It holds magnetic
fields in some way.

00:19:07.020 --> 00:19:10.560
And depending on the
distance your hand is

00:19:10.560 --> 00:19:16.610
to either the pitch antenna
or the volume antenna,

00:19:16.610 --> 00:19:19.230
you're going to get a different
amount of capacitance.

00:19:19.230 --> 00:19:21.380
Now, the way the
circuit works is,

00:19:21.380 --> 00:19:23.750
depending on the value
of the capacitance,

00:19:23.750 --> 00:19:26.690
there is a natural
frequency that emerges.

00:19:26.690 --> 00:19:29.240
And that natural
frequency is the basis

00:19:29.240 --> 00:19:33.960
for how you change the
pitch or the volume.

00:19:33.960 --> 00:19:35.640
Now, let me explain
this a little bit.

00:19:35.640 --> 00:19:39.290
There is almost identical
math in a situation which

00:19:39.290 --> 00:19:41.270
is probably more
familiar to you,

00:19:41.270 --> 00:19:43.290
which is a child's swing set.

00:19:43.290 --> 00:19:45.650
And in the child's
swing set, depending

00:19:45.650 --> 00:19:47.900
on the length of the
rope for the swing,

00:19:47.900 --> 00:19:51.170
you're going to get a different
frequency that the swing moves

00:19:51.170 --> 00:19:52.110
back and forth.

00:19:52.110 --> 00:19:57.320
So the longer the rope,
the slower the swing moves.

00:19:57.320 --> 00:20:00.740
So the capacitance basically
plays the same role

00:20:00.740 --> 00:20:08.000
as the length of the rope
that holds up the swing--

00:20:08.000 --> 00:20:11.330
the length of the rope
that holds up the swing.

00:20:11.330 --> 00:20:14.240
So that is the main
controlling factor.

00:20:14.240 --> 00:20:16.280
So you'll have a
natural frequency

00:20:16.280 --> 00:20:18.080
that then gets interrogated.

00:20:18.080 --> 00:20:23.420
Now, the big issue is that the
natural frequency associated

00:20:23.420 --> 00:20:26.390
with either the pitch or
the volume that comes out

00:20:26.390 --> 00:20:28.970
is going to be, typically,
at a radio frequency.

00:20:28.970 --> 00:20:31.410
So it's somewhere of
the order of megahertz,

00:20:31.410 --> 00:20:34.460
which is well beyond the
range of human hearing.

00:20:34.460 --> 00:20:38.000
And the real game is to,
then, take that signal

00:20:38.000 --> 00:20:40.084
and convert it into
an audio signal

00:20:40.084 --> 00:20:41.750
around the range of
human hearing, which

00:20:41.750 --> 00:20:47.340
is 30 hertz to about 20,000
hertz cycles per second.

00:20:47.340 --> 00:20:49.610
And to do that, what
Theremin did was he

00:20:49.610 --> 00:20:53.670
took a fairly recent
invention, for him,

00:20:53.670 --> 00:20:55.220
which was called heterodyning.

00:20:55.220 --> 00:20:57.140
And in heterodyning,
what you do is

00:20:57.140 --> 00:21:01.460
you introduce a frequency that's
close to the natural frequency

00:21:01.460 --> 00:21:03.890
that occurs between the
capacitance of the hand

00:21:03.890 --> 00:21:07.352
and the antenna and
the inductor inside.

00:21:07.352 --> 00:21:08.810
And then, what that
does is there's

00:21:08.810 --> 00:21:12.740
an interference between the
frequency source that you have

00:21:12.740 --> 00:21:15.740
inside here and the frequency
that you're naturally creating

00:21:15.740 --> 00:21:17.760
by having your hand near here.

00:21:17.760 --> 00:21:19.310
And the interference
between the two

00:21:19.310 --> 00:21:22.850
will then create a much
lower frequency pattern.

00:21:22.850 --> 00:21:25.040
And then, you take that
lower frequency pattern

00:21:25.040 --> 00:21:26.690
and turn that into
the sound that

00:21:26.690 --> 00:21:32.450
emerges both in controlling the
volume here and the pitch here.

00:21:32.450 --> 00:21:34.550
And that's what comes out.

00:21:34.550 --> 00:21:38.780
Heterodyning is also
used in FM radio.

00:21:38.780 --> 00:21:40.880
Frequency modulation
is probably the term

00:21:40.880 --> 00:21:43.630
that you're more familiar
with, whereas the word

00:21:43.630 --> 00:21:46.700
heterodyning is kind of
just out in left field.

00:21:46.700 --> 00:21:49.880
So more or less,
that's how this works.

00:21:49.880 --> 00:21:54.650
Now, the other thing
is how the bug works.

00:21:54.650 --> 00:21:57.500
And the bug is kind of
an inverse of the way

00:21:57.500 --> 00:21:58.870
the theremin operates.

00:21:58.870 --> 00:22:00.180
So let me explain a little bit.

00:22:00.180 --> 00:22:01.180
So what you want to do--

00:22:01.180 --> 00:22:03.330
I mean, how would you
think about how to do this?

00:22:03.330 --> 00:22:05.840
You know, Stalin handed
Theremin this problem,

00:22:05.840 --> 00:22:08.090
and he has this bag
of electrical tricks

00:22:08.090 --> 00:22:08.820
up his sleeve.

00:22:08.820 --> 00:22:11.000
And so you want to
take this plaque that

00:22:11.000 --> 00:22:14.210
was given to Averell
Harriman in 1949,

00:22:14.210 --> 00:22:16.950
and you want to be able to
listen in on the conversation.

00:22:16.950 --> 00:22:19.700
So you have, again, sound
from the human voice,

00:22:19.700 --> 00:22:23.630
which is roughly 30
hertz to 20,000 hertz.

00:22:23.630 --> 00:22:27.859
But then, you want to convert it
into a radio frequency signal.

00:22:27.859 --> 00:22:29.900
OK, so it's the inverse
of what's happening here,

00:22:29.900 --> 00:22:32.108
is you're taking something
which is a radio frequency

00:22:32.108 --> 00:22:34.430
signal electrically,
turning it into a sound.

00:22:34.430 --> 00:22:36.350
So you just invert the problem.

00:22:36.350 --> 00:22:41.750
So what Lev did was he
created a kind of circuit,

00:22:41.750 --> 00:22:43.040
again, with a capacitor.

00:22:43.040 --> 00:22:46.640
And the capacitor, in
this case, one side of it

00:22:46.640 --> 00:22:49.670
could vibrate back
and forth associated

00:22:49.670 --> 00:22:50.660
with the voice pattern.

00:22:50.660 --> 00:22:53.840
So somebody would speak, the
air molecules would vibrate,

00:22:53.840 --> 00:22:56.900
and then part of this capacitor
would vibrate back and forth.

00:22:56.900 --> 00:22:59.780
The distance between a fixed
plate and this vibrating plate

00:22:59.780 --> 00:23:01.340
would change the capacitance.

00:23:01.340 --> 00:23:04.610
And it would, again, be part of
the circuit, which is actually

00:23:04.610 --> 00:23:05.480
a passive circuit.

00:23:05.480 --> 00:23:06.920
There were no
batteries involved.

00:23:06.920 --> 00:23:10.340
Because who's going to go
into Averell Harriman's office

00:23:10.340 --> 00:23:13.630
and, hey, I got to change the
batteries on the bug, right?

00:23:13.630 --> 00:23:16.370
So it has to be
completely passive.

00:23:16.370 --> 00:23:20.570
So again, there was this
capacitive inductive circuit

00:23:20.570 --> 00:23:22.340
that had a natural frequency.

00:23:22.340 --> 00:23:24.800
And that natural frequency
would change a little bit

00:23:24.800 --> 00:23:27.290
as you vibrated it.

00:23:27.290 --> 00:23:31.120
And this is very much
like the RFID chip.

00:23:31.120 --> 00:23:33.570
So for example, in the
transponders in your car

00:23:33.570 --> 00:23:35.600
when you go past a
toll plaza, and they

00:23:35.600 --> 00:23:38.030
want to know exactly
where your car is,

00:23:38.030 --> 00:23:39.350
there are multiple frequencies.

00:23:39.350 --> 00:23:43.250
So what happens is that
they beam a radio frequency

00:23:43.250 --> 00:23:46.130
signal at your car-- always
beaming there-- but then,

00:23:46.130 --> 00:23:48.650
it comes back with a
variety of frequencies

00:23:48.650 --> 00:23:50.810
that you can then
look at and uniquely

00:23:50.810 --> 00:23:53.030
identify that that's your car.

00:23:53.030 --> 00:23:55.160
Marathon runners put these
chips in their shoes,

00:23:55.160 --> 00:23:58.900
and you track how they're
going and that sort of thing.

00:23:58.900 --> 00:24:00.590
So here, you have
this thing that's

00:24:00.590 --> 00:24:03.830
oscillating at a
certain frequency that

00:24:03.830 --> 00:24:09.410
is dependent on the capacitance
of that little thing,

00:24:09.410 --> 00:24:11.090
the capacitance changing.

00:24:11.090 --> 00:24:13.220
And so what the
Soviets then did was

00:24:13.220 --> 00:24:16.520
they beamed a radio
frequency signal

00:24:16.520 --> 00:24:18.860
towards Harriman's office.

00:24:18.860 --> 00:24:23.300
And then, that would create some
interference between the two,

00:24:23.300 --> 00:24:26.900
and then it would
naturally rebroadcast out

00:24:26.900 --> 00:24:30.800
the signal, which you could then
use to interrogate and find out

00:24:30.800 --> 00:24:33.290
what people were saying,
much the same way you

00:24:33.290 --> 00:24:36.500
are broadcasting a
signal into the radio

00:24:36.500 --> 00:24:38.810
transponder in
your car, and then

00:24:38.810 --> 00:24:41.910
you're able to get a unique
signature that's coming back.

00:24:41.910 --> 00:24:43.520
So that was the basis of this.

00:24:43.520 --> 00:24:45.470
And the way it was
found, of course,

00:24:45.470 --> 00:24:49.220
is that, ultimately, this
thing has to rebroadcast out

00:24:49.220 --> 00:24:53.090
some sort of signal, the same
way your car's RFID chip would

00:24:53.090 --> 00:24:54.690
broadcast out a signal.

00:24:54.690 --> 00:24:56.990
And so, ultimately,
people were able to detect

00:24:56.990 --> 00:24:59.660
that this radio frequency signal
was getting broadcasted out.

00:24:59.660 --> 00:25:01.659
And they knocked that out.

00:25:01.659 --> 00:25:03.950
And then people started to
look for this sort of thing.

00:25:03.950 --> 00:25:06.140
But then, spy versus
spy-- you always

00:25:06.140 --> 00:25:07.810
have to come up
with a better idea.

00:25:07.810 --> 00:25:10.370
So there was another idea
that the Soviets came up with,

00:25:10.370 --> 00:25:13.106
which was to beam a microwave
signal towards the windows,

00:25:13.106 --> 00:25:14.980
and the windows would
vibrate back and forth,

00:25:14.980 --> 00:25:18.250
and you could listen in doing
that, and on and on and on.

00:25:18.250 --> 00:25:22.450
So I could talk about
electronic espionage forever.

00:25:22.450 --> 00:25:24.280
But I'm not going to.

00:25:24.280 --> 00:25:25.640
And I'll turn it back to Dorit.

00:25:25.640 --> 00:25:27.931
But if people have questions
in the question and answer

00:25:27.931 --> 00:25:30.956
session, we can address it then.

00:25:30.956 --> 00:25:34.780
[APPLAUSE]

00:25:40.050 --> 00:25:42.860
- Yeah, so maybe we have
a little bit more time

00:25:42.860 --> 00:25:47.240
to just see what
happened to the theremin

00:25:47.240 --> 00:25:51.620
after Lev left the
States and disappeared,

00:25:51.620 --> 00:25:55.400
working on other
important devices.

00:25:55.400 --> 00:26:01.850
In the '30s, composers started
to write for the instrument,

00:26:01.850 --> 00:26:05.810
maybe most noted
Messiaen or Percy

00:26:05.810 --> 00:26:09.860
Grainger, Robert Schillinger.

00:26:09.860 --> 00:26:14.080
And Clara Rockmore did
a very good presentation

00:26:14.080 --> 00:26:18.040
as a virtuoso interpreting
the instrument.

00:26:18.040 --> 00:26:21.320
Then, in the late '40s,
the theremin, I guess,

00:26:21.320 --> 00:26:28.010
reached its most defining,
notorious popularity--

00:26:28.010 --> 00:26:29.990
up to now, hopefully--

00:26:29.990 --> 00:26:31.990
through Hollywood.

00:26:31.990 --> 00:26:34.490
That's a sound you
probably heard but didn't

00:26:34.490 --> 00:26:37.250
realize it was a theremin.

00:26:37.250 --> 00:26:43.070
It was first, I think,
started in 1947, Spellbound--

00:26:43.070 --> 00:26:47.360
Miklós Rózsa wrote
a beautiful score--

00:26:47.360 --> 00:26:48.890
the Hitchcock movie.

00:26:48.890 --> 00:26:51.200
And whenever Gregory
Peck would have

00:26:51.200 --> 00:26:57.140
his memory spells,
the sound of madness,

00:26:57.140 --> 00:26:59.600
the theremin lent itself.

00:26:59.600 --> 00:27:03.560
The eerie, almost
like a voice quality,

00:27:03.560 --> 00:27:05.540
was applied there
very effectively.

00:27:05.540 --> 00:27:06.890
And then, it went on from there.

00:27:06.890 --> 00:27:11.390
It turned into the
dramatic voice of madness

00:27:11.390 --> 00:27:12.910
in The Lost Weekend.

00:27:12.910 --> 00:27:16.730
And then, it was discovered
by science fiction and horror

00:27:16.730 --> 00:27:18.870
and represented there.

00:27:18.870 --> 00:27:22.230
And I would like to maybe
play a piece from that era

00:27:22.230 --> 00:27:26.420
by one of my favorite
composers, Bernard Herrmann.

00:27:26.420 --> 00:27:30.590
He did the score for The
Day the Earth Stood Still.

00:27:30.590 --> 00:27:33.710
And you might have
heard that one before.

00:27:45.187 --> 00:29:44.947
[MUSIC - BERNARD HERRMANN, "THE
 DAY THE EARTH STOOD STILL"]

00:29:44.947 --> 00:29:48.939
[APPLAUSE]

00:29:51.434 --> 00:29:52.610
Yeah.

00:29:52.610 --> 00:29:54.710
So, yeah.

00:29:54.710 --> 00:29:59.020
This is what the theremin is the
most well-known for, I guess.

00:29:59.020 --> 00:30:02.910
But fact is it can do
much more than that.

00:30:02.910 --> 00:30:09.160
It was then employed by
bands in the '60s and '70s,

00:30:09.160 --> 00:30:14.020
most namely the Beach
Boys or Captain Beefheart,

00:30:14.020 --> 00:30:16.180
or even Led Zeppelin.

00:30:16.180 --> 00:30:20.590
Two days ago, we met Micky
Dolenz of the Monkees.

00:30:20.590 --> 00:30:23.930
And my first question to him
was, have you ever played--

00:30:23.930 --> 00:30:25.240
do you know the theremin?

00:30:25.240 --> 00:30:26.550
And he said, yeah.

00:30:26.550 --> 00:30:32.200
I was at the Beach Boys' studio
and played the theremin there.

00:30:32.200 --> 00:30:37.150
And so obviously, it
was around at that time.

00:30:37.150 --> 00:30:40.090
It's also very interesting
that the theremin is really

00:30:40.090 --> 00:30:44.520
often referred to as the
dinosaurs of the synthesizers.

00:30:44.520 --> 00:30:49.300
Don Buchla and Bob Moog, who
both were the first people

00:30:49.300 --> 00:30:51.370
working and creating
synthesizers,

00:30:51.370 --> 00:30:56.980
they always referenced Lev
Theremin and his device.

00:30:56.980 --> 00:31:03.370
Don Buchla is quoted as saying
Lev was his big idol because he

00:31:03.370 --> 00:31:09.940
is so impressed how he created
the theremin without having

00:31:09.940 --> 00:31:14.080
an oscilloscope and
just a few waves.

00:31:14.080 --> 00:31:17.590
And Bob Moog started
his first company

00:31:17.590 --> 00:31:21.940
when he was 14 building
theremins out of Brooklyn.

00:31:21.940 --> 00:31:24.970
And he is still one of
the main producers--

00:31:24.970 --> 00:31:27.220
his company-- of theremins.

00:31:27.220 --> 00:31:32.440
This is actually a theremini,
kind of a little detour

00:31:32.440 --> 00:31:34.270
of the original theremin.

00:31:34.270 --> 00:31:37.060
But it's light and
portable, so I like it.

00:31:37.060 --> 00:31:40.720
And it's a customized
prototype here.

00:31:40.720 --> 00:31:45.040
But this instrument actually
combines the analog interface

00:31:45.040 --> 00:31:48.130
of the theremin with
digital technology

00:31:48.130 --> 00:31:50.980
by having all these
presets inside.

00:31:50.980 --> 00:31:55.780
And it even has a theremin's
worst enemy, pitch control.

00:31:55.780 --> 00:31:58.990
So why all this effort if
the pitch is controlled?

00:31:58.990 --> 00:32:03.430
But everything you hear from
me is turning all these helpers

00:32:03.430 --> 00:32:07.750
off, and I'm only playing
with the very pure [INAUDIBLE]

00:32:07.750 --> 00:32:12.940
and setting as it
originally was intended.

00:32:12.940 --> 00:32:16.960
Maybe now-- we kind of
landed in the present,

00:32:16.960 --> 00:32:19.340
and I want to play a
contemporary composition

00:32:19.340 --> 00:32:22.340
so you get a little
bit of an idea,

00:32:22.340 --> 00:32:26.740
in addition to melodic playing,
what the theremin can do.

00:32:30.732 --> 00:32:35.223
[MUSIC - DORIT CHRYSLER, "RUBIES
 AND PEARLS"]

00:35:03.925 --> 00:35:06.420
It has a very unique--

00:35:06.420 --> 00:35:09.913
[APPLAUSE]

00:35:12.660 --> 00:35:16.220
So it has a very
unique weaving quality

00:35:16.220 --> 00:35:21.460
that can be applied for a
lot of things, especially,

00:35:21.460 --> 00:35:22.400
also, soundtracks.

00:35:22.400 --> 00:35:26.090
And I really wish that
more contemporary composers

00:35:26.090 --> 00:35:27.980
would write for a theremin.

00:35:27.980 --> 00:35:30.290
It has eight octaves.

00:35:30.290 --> 00:35:33.040
One of the issues
is that it still

00:35:33.040 --> 00:35:37.160
would need a notation
language that

00:35:37.160 --> 00:35:40.430
can express all the things the
theremin can do in addition

00:35:40.430 --> 00:35:43.150
to just simple melodies.

00:35:43.150 --> 00:35:45.890
And we now have more
and more interpreters

00:35:45.890 --> 00:35:48.410
that would be capable to
play these compositions.

00:35:48.410 --> 00:35:51.110
But we do need the repertoire.

00:35:51.110 --> 00:35:52.460
Any questions?

00:36:01.270 --> 00:36:02.850
- That's gorgeous, yeah.

00:36:02.850 --> 00:36:06.090
I'm a professional musician,
so I have a couple questions.

00:36:06.090 --> 00:36:12.400
One is I am assuming that you
cannot play more than one note

00:36:12.400 --> 00:36:14.590
at a time with a theremin.

00:36:14.590 --> 00:36:17.260
However, I was wondering,
with the foot pedal,

00:36:17.260 --> 00:36:21.090
were you processing
things that you were--

00:36:21.090 --> 00:36:24.440
and that was not part of the
original theremin, correct?

00:36:24.440 --> 00:36:26.980
This is a more modern edition?

00:36:26.980 --> 00:36:29.710
And you mentioned notation.

00:36:29.710 --> 00:36:31.990
So I was very interested in it.

00:36:31.990 --> 00:36:33.680
Because you called
it a composition.

00:36:33.680 --> 00:36:36.370
So how is the notation?

00:36:36.370 --> 00:36:40.770
How does that-- like the
last piece you played.

00:36:40.770 --> 00:36:43.100
You called it a composition.

00:36:43.100 --> 00:36:45.230
Thank you.

00:36:45.230 --> 00:36:45.830
- Yeah.

00:36:45.830 --> 00:36:48.380
So that was a composition.

00:36:48.380 --> 00:36:52.070
That was my composition, so I
can take a very free approach.

00:36:52.070 --> 00:36:52.730
And that just--

00:36:52.730 --> 00:36:55.070
[SCATTERED APPLAUSE]

00:36:55.070 --> 00:36:58.719
So I just can take liberties
without a notation system,

00:36:58.719 --> 00:37:01.385
because it's my own composition,
without offending the composer.

00:37:04.910 --> 00:37:13.850
But yeah, this is one of the
issues that it would need an--

00:37:13.850 --> 00:37:16.220
the beauty of the
theremin is that I

00:37:16.220 --> 00:37:20.420
think it is a very
interesting tool of expression

00:37:20.420 --> 00:37:28.070
and exploring different
sound approaches.

00:37:28.070 --> 00:37:30.560
Because it is so physical.

00:37:30.560 --> 00:37:32.840
It's literally your
body is the instrument.

00:37:32.840 --> 00:37:36.530
And because it is still such a
young instrument, in comparison

00:37:36.530 --> 00:37:42.230
with the Greek
hydraulic water system.

00:37:42.230 --> 00:37:44.750
They took hundreds
and hundreds of years

00:37:44.750 --> 00:37:48.260
to establish themselves.

00:37:48.260 --> 00:37:52.430
The sounds that the theremin
is defined through, I think,

00:37:52.430 --> 00:37:54.060
has still not been found.

00:37:54.060 --> 00:37:56.960
And that's the challenge
and opportunity

00:37:56.960 --> 00:38:00.860
for musicians and
composers to dive into that

00:38:00.860 --> 00:38:04.430
and establish and
find that and also

00:38:04.430 --> 00:38:06.890
be able to write that down.

00:38:06.890 --> 00:38:11.160
- So what happens in a typical
theremin society in New York,

00:38:11.160 --> 00:38:14.750
and how do the neighbors
react to the noise?

00:38:14.750 --> 00:38:17.540
- No neighbor is happy when
someone starts taking up

00:38:17.540 --> 00:38:19.385
the theremin, including mine.

00:38:22.880 --> 00:38:26.030
But it is doable.

00:38:26.030 --> 00:38:29.090
And I encourage--
musicians and non-musicians

00:38:29.090 --> 00:38:33.060
have almost an equal
take because it's

00:38:33.060 --> 00:38:36.920
such a different way of
rhetorically approaching it,

00:38:36.920 --> 00:38:38.250
like any other instrument.

00:38:38.250 --> 00:38:41.540
So I think it's a fair game.

00:38:41.540 --> 00:38:43.280
The New York Theremin
Society was really

00:38:43.280 --> 00:38:46.250
founded as a community platform.

00:38:46.250 --> 00:38:51.020
And it turns out there's a
big international community.

00:38:51.020 --> 00:38:58.300
And it really tries to promote
the theremin being applied

00:38:58.300 --> 00:39:01.830
in different forms of arts.

00:39:01.830 --> 00:39:05.660
To give it a proper context,
one of the downfalls, one

00:39:05.660 --> 00:39:08.450
of the curses, of the
theremin is that I don't think

00:39:08.450 --> 00:39:11.270
there are many other instruments
that so easily can sound

00:39:11.270 --> 00:39:14.120
so terrible and unmusical--

00:39:14.120 --> 00:39:15.650
like any other instrument.

00:39:15.650 --> 00:39:18.590
And so a lot of people
might know the theremin

00:39:18.590 --> 00:39:21.860
but permanently
underestimate it and think

00:39:21.860 --> 00:39:25.280
it's only capable to kind of--

00:39:25.280 --> 00:39:27.640
so it really, the New
York Theremin Society

00:39:27.640 --> 00:39:30.380
is one of many
organizations that

00:39:30.380 --> 00:39:35.840
try to guard the context
so people really understand

00:39:35.840 --> 00:39:37.160
what the instrument can do.

00:39:37.160 --> 00:39:39.850
Because it still needs to
be explained, unfortunately.

00:39:39.850 --> 00:39:41.910
Thank you.

00:39:41.910 --> 00:39:44.790
- I have a question for you
about your playing technique.

00:39:44.790 --> 00:39:48.450
I tried a theremin
for all of one day

00:39:48.450 --> 00:39:52.080
and stopped because of
complaints from my neighbors.

00:39:52.080 --> 00:39:54.780
But like most people
who try a theremin,

00:39:54.780 --> 00:39:57.060
usually download a
book by Clara Rockmore

00:39:57.060 --> 00:39:58.860
and look at hand positions.

00:39:58.860 --> 00:40:01.940
And your technique was
totally different from hers.

00:40:01.940 --> 00:40:06.060
And I'm wondering whether you
created your own technique,

00:40:06.060 --> 00:40:10.156
whether all good thereminists
develop their own technique,

00:40:10.156 --> 00:40:12.030
or whether they all
start with Clara Rockmore

00:40:12.030 --> 00:40:13.470
and then move out from there.

00:40:13.470 --> 00:40:14.616
- That's a great question.

00:40:14.616 --> 00:40:15.990
I think the theremin
right now is

00:40:15.990 --> 00:40:20.210
in the stage where the violin
was in the 18th century, where

00:40:20.210 --> 00:40:22.860
different schools
started to sprout

00:40:22.860 --> 00:40:24.690
in different regions
of the world.

00:40:24.690 --> 00:40:28.980
And you actually recognize from
which region the students--

00:40:28.980 --> 00:40:29.910
from which teacher--

00:40:29.910 --> 00:40:31.350
the students come.

00:40:31.350 --> 00:40:34.410
So there are some
players that developed

00:40:34.410 --> 00:40:37.170
very specific techniques.

00:40:37.170 --> 00:40:39.450
And I have no technique.

00:40:39.450 --> 00:40:41.580
And I'm teaching a lot.

00:40:41.580 --> 00:40:47.810
So these techniques
of Clara Rockmore--

00:40:47.810 --> 00:40:51.250
my take is it really depends
on what you want to do,

00:40:51.250 --> 00:40:54.000
what your goal is of
what you want to achieve.

00:40:54.000 --> 00:40:59.310
If you want to play
Rachmaninoff or if you want to--

00:40:59.310 --> 00:41:01.060
so it depends on that.

00:41:01.060 --> 00:41:06.300
And I believe everyone has a
natural, stable hand position.

00:41:06.300 --> 00:41:10.410
And this instrument really
does give the opportunity

00:41:10.410 --> 00:41:12.720
to develop your own
style and get as

00:41:12.720 --> 00:41:15.760
far as you want to get with it.

00:41:15.760 --> 00:41:18.660
And if you choose to find
one of the techniques--

00:41:18.660 --> 00:41:21.060
which now can be found online--

00:41:21.060 --> 00:41:23.490
that might be right for
you, that's OK, too.

00:41:23.490 --> 00:41:25.830
So that kind of freedom
really appealed to me

00:41:25.830 --> 00:41:27.330
when I started
playing the theremin,

00:41:27.330 --> 00:41:31.250
and it might appeal
to others, too.

00:41:31.250 --> 00:41:33.644
- I was wondering,
you mentioned bands

00:41:33.644 --> 00:41:35.810
like the Beach Boys, and
the Rolling Stones, and Led

00:41:35.810 --> 00:41:37.520
Zeppelin, actually, as well.

00:41:37.520 --> 00:41:40.190
And I was wondering in
which tracks, notably,

00:41:40.190 --> 00:41:41.479
is the theremin used?

00:41:41.479 --> 00:41:43.270
Because I've listened
to these bands a lot.

00:41:43.270 --> 00:41:46.070
And they all experiment with
sound and do some weird sounds,

00:41:46.070 --> 00:41:48.990
but I can never tell if it's
guitar or something different.

00:41:48.990 --> 00:41:52.899
So in which tracks is that
the prominent feature?

00:41:52.899 --> 00:41:53.940
- That's a good question.

00:41:53.940 --> 00:41:55.740
Maybe, John, can you
help me with that?

00:41:55.740 --> 00:41:56.740
Do you know?

00:41:56.740 --> 00:41:58.740
- Well, Led Zeppelin,
"Whole Lotta Love."

00:41:58.740 --> 00:42:00.740
That's the most notable one.

00:42:00.740 --> 00:42:04.468
[INTERPOSING VOICES]

00:42:04.468 --> 00:42:06.798
- Jimmy Page played a
pitch-only theremin.

00:42:06.798 --> 00:42:11.120
- We have a Boston
theremin colleague.

00:42:11.120 --> 00:42:13.120
- Jimmy Page played a
pitch-only theremin.

00:42:13.120 --> 00:42:15.210
It was just one single antenna.

00:42:15.210 --> 00:42:19.520
By pitch-only, I mean there
was no volume control.

00:42:19.520 --> 00:42:24.260
Beach Boys, most notably,
didn't really use a theremin.

00:42:24.260 --> 00:42:26.810
Brian Wilson wanted
that theremin sound.

00:42:26.810 --> 00:42:28.340
He didn't care how he got it.

00:42:28.340 --> 00:42:32.150
So if you've seen the
theremin documentary, which

00:42:32.150 --> 00:42:34.577
Dorit alluded to it--

00:42:34.577 --> 00:42:36.410
there's a theremin
documentary that came out

00:42:36.410 --> 00:42:40.100
about 20 years ago, I guess--

00:42:40.100 --> 00:42:42.050
and they interview
Brian Wilson, and he

00:42:42.050 --> 00:42:43.460
talks about getting a theremin.

00:42:43.460 --> 00:42:46.180
But really, he just
wanted that sound.

00:42:46.180 --> 00:42:49.350
He hired somebody who
said, this is too hard

00:42:49.350 --> 00:42:50.350
to play on the theremin.

00:42:50.350 --> 00:42:54.148
And the guy invented his own
mechanically controlled--

00:42:54.148 --> 00:42:55.341
- [INAUDIBLE]

00:42:55.341 --> 00:42:55.840
- Yeah.

00:42:55.840 --> 00:42:57.239
And then-- yeah.

00:42:57.239 --> 00:42:59.530
It was later dubbed the
Tannerin because the man's name

00:42:59.530 --> 00:43:01.860
was Paul Tanner.

00:43:01.860 --> 00:43:05.920
And then, on tour, even,
the Beach Boys most recently

00:43:05.920 --> 00:43:08.830
used a ribbon-controlled
instrument, as opposed

00:43:08.830 --> 00:43:12.260
to a theremin, just because
it's easier to hit those notes.

00:43:12.260 --> 00:43:15.280
But that sound was used on
songs like "Good Vibrations"

00:43:15.280 --> 00:43:15.910
for that.

00:43:15.910 --> 00:43:19.810
[HUMMING]-- that thing.

00:43:19.810 --> 00:43:23.170
So that's Led Zeppelin
and the Beach Boys.

00:43:23.170 --> 00:43:24.640
But there have been--

00:43:24.640 --> 00:43:28.278
lots of bands today are
using the theremin, as well.

00:43:28.278 --> 00:43:32.710
- It's kind of hard to tell
these days because most likely,

00:43:32.710 --> 00:43:33.940
they're just like Portishead.

00:43:33.940 --> 00:43:38.560
They use a mock synthesizer
to simulate the theremin.

00:43:38.560 --> 00:43:41.440
- The theremin always
has some imperfections.

00:43:41.440 --> 00:43:43.641
If it sounds too good,
it's [INAUDIBLE]..

00:43:43.641 --> 00:43:44.140
- Yeah.

00:43:44.140 --> 00:43:44.639
You know.

00:43:50.540 --> 00:43:52.550
- Actually, I have two parts.

00:43:52.550 --> 00:43:57.190
Have you ever had a chance
to play one of the older

00:43:57.190 --> 00:43:59.650
original instruments?

00:43:59.650 --> 00:44:03.550
And you have a little one.

00:44:03.550 --> 00:44:05.170
Have they sampled that?

00:44:05.170 --> 00:44:06.820
- This is a great question.

00:44:06.820 --> 00:44:09.370
In fact, this is
really interesting

00:44:09.370 --> 00:44:13.240
to know for everyone
that likes the theremin.

00:44:13.240 --> 00:44:15.190
There are a few of
them floating around,

00:44:15.190 --> 00:44:18.850
and there's a
collector in Paris.

00:44:18.850 --> 00:44:21.160
And he had an original.

00:44:21.160 --> 00:44:22.870
He has all functioning
instruments,

00:44:22.870 --> 00:44:27.160
and he had an RCA from
the '20s with the speaker,

00:44:27.160 --> 00:44:32.290
and also the Vanguard--
several different theremins

00:44:32.290 --> 00:44:34.900
from the '50s that
Bob Moog built.

00:44:34.900 --> 00:44:38.925
And trying them out literally
changed my life because--

00:44:38.925 --> 00:44:42.070
and it's something I would
like to organize for next year,

00:44:42.070 --> 00:44:44.060
for the 100th birthday--

00:44:44.060 --> 00:44:48.130
these instruments
make you realize

00:44:48.130 --> 00:44:52.120
why there was such excitement
and such promise back then.

00:44:52.120 --> 00:44:55.360
Because if you listen to all
the theremin we have now,

00:44:55.360 --> 00:44:57.130
they sound like Mickey Mouse.

00:44:57.130 --> 00:45:00.730
They sound like tricycles in
comparison with these theremin.

00:45:00.730 --> 00:45:02.230
They are like big trucks.

00:45:02.230 --> 00:45:04.740
The valves-- they
sound humongous.

00:45:04.740 --> 00:45:07.390
They have a fleshy, big sound.

00:45:07.390 --> 00:45:10.090
It has, also, a lot to
do with the speakers.

00:45:10.090 --> 00:45:12.670
Because fact is,
something that no active

00:45:12.670 --> 00:45:15.740
thereminist these days
takes much in consideration,

00:45:15.740 --> 00:45:16.570
including myself--

00:45:16.570 --> 00:45:18.645
I want to change this ASAP--

00:45:18.645 --> 00:45:20.020
is that, actually,
the instrument

00:45:20.020 --> 00:45:23.800
consists of the theremin
and its speaker.

00:45:23.800 --> 00:45:26.950
And Lev, specifically, also
had the matching speakers.

00:45:26.950 --> 00:45:28.610
So that makes all
the difference.

00:45:28.610 --> 00:45:31.930
So this is also yet one of
the missing links we still

00:45:31.930 --> 00:45:33.400
have to put together.

00:45:33.400 --> 00:45:34.240
Great question.

00:45:34.240 --> 00:45:36.740
Thank you.

00:45:36.740 --> 00:45:37.310
- Hi.

00:45:37.310 --> 00:45:39.140
I was wondering if
I or anyone else

00:45:39.140 --> 00:45:42.350
here was inspired to start
learning the theremin,

00:45:42.350 --> 00:45:45.080
if you would have advice about
where to start or how to start?

00:45:48.140 --> 00:45:50.180
- Yes.

00:45:50.180 --> 00:45:53.390
Pick a song you really
like, and close your eyes,

00:45:53.390 --> 00:45:55.400
and play along to it.

00:45:55.400 --> 00:45:59.120
First lesson, learn how the
volume works to not shoot

00:45:59.120 --> 00:46:02.090
your frequency range.

00:46:02.090 --> 00:46:05.840
And go online and find
out some information.

00:46:05.840 --> 00:46:09.980
But we're trying more and more
to offer theremin lectures

00:46:09.980 --> 00:46:11.320
and theremin classes.

00:46:11.320 --> 00:46:13.400
Because all you really
need is to understand

00:46:13.400 --> 00:46:15.860
how to calibrate
a theremin, which

00:46:15.860 --> 00:46:19.060
means to set the size of the
pitch and the volume antenna

00:46:19.060 --> 00:46:21.740
and how to position yourself
in the most stable position.

00:46:21.740 --> 00:46:23.660
And then, you can
really kind of--

00:46:23.660 --> 00:46:26.390
if you master one
note perfectly,

00:46:26.390 --> 00:46:28.010
you can play the theremin.

00:46:28.010 --> 00:46:29.510
And that's a huge challenge.

00:46:29.510 --> 00:46:30.820
That might take you a year.

00:46:30.820 --> 00:46:33.500
But you're welcome to write.

00:46:33.500 --> 00:46:36.400
We're always happy to
give any kind of advice.

00:46:36.400 --> 00:46:37.720
But yeah.

00:46:37.720 --> 00:46:40.802
I hope this helps.

00:46:40.802 --> 00:46:42.510
- Thank you for a
wonderful presentation.

00:46:42.510 --> 00:46:45.030
At the beginning of your
performance of "The Day

00:46:45.030 --> 00:46:47.310
the Earth Stood Still,"
there was a section

00:46:47.310 --> 00:46:49.110
where the sound quality
went from sounding

00:46:49.110 --> 00:46:52.530
like what a theremin usually
sounds like to this almost

00:46:52.530 --> 00:46:54.290
sound cloud.

00:46:54.290 --> 00:46:55.290
What was going on there?

00:46:55.290 --> 00:46:56.370
Were you using a pedal?

00:46:56.370 --> 00:46:56.875
- Yes.

00:46:56.875 --> 00:46:57.750
- Tell me about that.

00:46:57.750 --> 00:46:58.249
- Yes.

00:46:58.249 --> 00:46:59.040
Very good ears.

00:46:59.040 --> 00:47:03.450
I was, because the sound system
here didn't allow me to add

00:47:03.450 --> 00:47:08.520
a tiny subtle reverb to kind of
widen and fatten the frequency

00:47:08.520 --> 00:47:12.240
like I usually do a little
bit-- we have a very barebone

00:47:12.240 --> 00:47:13.680
technical--

00:47:13.680 --> 00:47:16.230
but it does the job beautifully.

00:47:16.230 --> 00:47:18.690
So that's why I thought
maybe this piece would

00:47:18.690 --> 00:47:20.280
be better if I just have--

00:47:20.280 --> 00:47:23.520
I was looping it
very quickly and then

00:47:23.520 --> 00:47:26.860
realized it's too much, and I
chose to have it clean again.

00:47:26.860 --> 00:47:29.310
So I was just experimenting
in the moment of the song.

00:47:29.310 --> 00:47:31.050
- There's looping and reverb?

00:47:31.050 --> 00:47:31.910
- Yes.

00:47:31.910 --> 00:47:35.321
I was creating a very muddy
reverb by a very fast loop.

00:47:35.321 --> 00:47:35.820
- I see.

00:47:35.820 --> 00:47:36.510
I see.

00:47:36.510 --> 00:47:37.427
That was wonderful.

00:47:37.427 --> 00:47:39.510
Was that part of the
original-- when you performed

00:47:39.510 --> 00:47:41.700
that, was that also how it
was performed for the movie,

00:47:41.700 --> 00:47:42.790
or was that something
you introduced?

00:47:42.790 --> 00:47:43.260
- No.

00:47:43.260 --> 00:47:43.759
No, no, no.

00:47:43.759 --> 00:47:45.650
Back then, they really--

00:47:45.650 --> 00:47:46.860
that's the interesting thing.

00:47:46.860 --> 00:47:49.590
Like a completely
new instrument that's

00:47:49.590 --> 00:47:54.050
invented with such dramatic
new tonal possibilities,

00:47:54.050 --> 00:47:57.270
and the phenomena of
people not having the--

00:47:57.270 --> 00:48:00.930
I'm not ready to really apply
all these new possibilities.

00:48:00.930 --> 00:48:03.270
And Lev wanted his
instrument to be

00:48:03.270 --> 00:48:07.230
taken serious, understandably,
so he applied it to the most

00:48:07.230 --> 00:48:10.260
established music style.

00:48:10.260 --> 00:48:14.080
And that limited
it a little bit.

00:48:14.080 --> 00:48:16.175
And so that's why it
kind of got stuck.

00:48:16.175 --> 00:48:16.675
- Yeah.

00:48:16.675 --> 00:48:17.841
Well, that was a revelation.

00:48:17.841 --> 00:48:20.400
It was like all the other
theremin music I've heard

00:48:20.400 --> 00:48:25.590
is like watching a Lamborghini
go up and down a neighborhood

00:48:25.590 --> 00:48:26.432
street.

00:48:26.432 --> 00:48:28.890
And when you did that, it just
opened it up and took it out

00:48:28.890 --> 00:48:29.680
onto the open road.

00:48:29.680 --> 00:48:30.060
So that was really interesting.

00:48:30.060 --> 00:48:30.870
Thank you.

00:48:30.870 --> 00:48:31.380
- Thank you.

00:48:31.380 --> 00:48:32.750
I'm glad.

00:48:32.750 --> 00:48:34.400
Yeah.

00:48:34.400 --> 00:48:36.470
- So obviously, you need
to have a lot of control

00:48:36.470 --> 00:48:37.790
to play the theremin.

00:48:37.790 --> 00:48:40.820
Is it possible to play it
with your head or your arm?

00:48:40.820 --> 00:48:42.830
- Yes.

00:48:42.830 --> 00:48:44.750
So when I started
to teach children--

00:48:44.750 --> 00:48:46.430
because I believe
there's not really

00:48:46.430 --> 00:48:50.450
much electronic early
music education around,

00:48:50.450 --> 00:48:54.200
and children being familiar
with the iPad and all

00:48:54.200 --> 00:48:57.860
these interactive things, but
actually physically creating

00:48:57.860 --> 00:48:59.390
the sound to motion
and motoric--

00:48:59.390 --> 00:49:01.010
it makes so much sense.

00:49:01.010 --> 00:49:03.020
And the really little
ones, from four-year-olds,

00:49:03.020 --> 00:49:05.750
they bring their favorite
teddy bears, and I ask them,

00:49:05.750 --> 00:49:06.950
can you play it with--

00:49:06.950 --> 00:49:10.610
so you can play it with
your nose, with your butt--

00:49:10.610 --> 00:49:16.010
whichever object, whichever
part of your body is the closest

00:49:16.010 --> 00:49:18.150
and shortens the
frequencies-- so it could be--

00:49:20.910 --> 00:49:23.778
so infinite possibilities.

00:49:23.778 --> 00:49:24.278
- Hello.

00:49:24.278 --> 00:49:24.778
- Hello.

00:49:24.778 --> 00:49:29.320
- You briefly touched upon this
subject on your presentation.

00:49:29.320 --> 00:49:31.290
So the nice thing
with the theremin

00:49:31.290 --> 00:49:35.460
is that you can play all
frequencies and no notes.

00:49:35.460 --> 00:49:38.450
But this makes it,
also, very hard.

00:49:38.450 --> 00:49:44.280
So is there any
space for basically

00:49:44.280 --> 00:49:47.940
mapping different positions
to just a specific scale

00:49:47.940 --> 00:49:49.530
so that it's more
easy for somebody

00:49:49.530 --> 00:49:54.970
to play on top of a song, to
play a solo, or to make music?

00:49:54.970 --> 00:49:56.760
- You mean without
connecting the notes?

00:49:56.760 --> 00:49:58.210
Is that what you mean?

00:49:58.210 --> 00:49:59.808
If you asked me to
play more staccato?

00:49:59.808 --> 00:50:02.170
I'm trying to understand
your question.

00:50:02.170 --> 00:50:04.240
- So instead of having,
now, this antenna, which

00:50:04.240 --> 00:50:06.870
maps through all frequencies,
to say I don't know,

00:50:06.870 --> 00:50:10.260
like from this capacity
to this capacity,

00:50:10.260 --> 00:50:11.700
it's going to be this note.

00:50:11.700 --> 00:50:14.760
And I'm only going to have
a specific chromatic scale

00:50:14.760 --> 00:50:16.480
or something that
matches the music.

00:50:16.480 --> 00:50:18.990
- That is a technical question
that's very interesting.

00:50:18.990 --> 00:50:19.940
Maybe--

00:50:19.940 --> 00:50:20.550
- Oh, no.

00:50:20.550 --> 00:50:22.890
I think-- I'm sure
this can be done.

00:50:22.890 --> 00:50:26.760
But the question is if you would
be interested in doing that.

00:50:26.760 --> 00:50:29.360
Because you would
be limiting yourself

00:50:29.360 --> 00:50:32.976
to just playing specific
notes that you allow yourself.

00:50:32.976 --> 00:50:34.350
Because anything
you play will be

00:50:34.350 --> 00:50:36.350
matching this part of the song.

00:50:36.350 --> 00:50:38.765
But it would make it much
easier for any novice to play.

00:50:38.765 --> 00:50:40.890
- Well, it's really
interesting what you're saying.

00:50:40.890 --> 00:50:43.540
You should go and work for
Moog Music immediately.

00:50:43.540 --> 00:50:44.250
They want you.

00:50:44.250 --> 00:50:46.630
Because that's what
this instrument--

00:50:46.630 --> 00:50:49.200
that's actually a new
invention that this instrument

00:50:49.200 --> 00:50:50.280
brought to the market.

00:50:50.280 --> 00:50:55.260
And these thereminis,
they do exactly that.

00:50:55.260 --> 00:50:58.620
You can set the range,
and you can set the key.

00:50:58.620 --> 00:51:00.660
And when you turn
the pitch control on,

00:51:00.660 --> 00:51:02.620
you play along to a song.

00:51:02.620 --> 00:51:06.750
So I can have 10 four-year-olds
in a circle playing

00:51:06.750 --> 00:51:07.400
10 theremins.

00:51:07.400 --> 00:51:09.930
They're all on the same setting,
and they play Kraftwerk,

00:51:09.930 --> 00:51:12.600
and it sounds perfectly in key.

00:51:12.600 --> 00:51:13.710
It's a miracle.

00:51:13.710 --> 00:51:15.690
Because the wrong
notes are filtered out.

00:51:15.690 --> 00:51:17.610
It's exactly what
you're describing.

00:51:17.610 --> 00:51:18.540
That was their idea.

00:51:18.540 --> 00:51:20.190
They came up with
that two years ago.

00:51:20.190 --> 00:51:23.910
And a lot of thereminists
were really angry

00:51:23.910 --> 00:51:26.830
when this came on the market.

00:51:26.830 --> 00:51:29.130
And also, when
things are not fully

00:51:29.130 --> 00:51:32.280
established yet, a lot of
people kind of hoarding it

00:51:32.280 --> 00:51:35.640
and want it all to
themselves, like I'm the--

00:51:35.640 --> 00:51:40.470
and I really believe that we
need inclusivity and community.

00:51:40.470 --> 00:51:43.630
And the more people, the more
it can grow into a movement.

00:51:43.630 --> 00:51:45.810
And so this instrument
really makes

00:51:45.810 --> 00:51:49.570
that bridge of having
an easy result.

00:51:49.570 --> 00:51:52.480
Because it is really,
really hard to play.

00:51:52.480 --> 00:51:53.730
So it sounds good.

00:51:53.730 --> 00:51:56.670
You have the filter, the
few notes that fit, exactly,

00:51:56.670 --> 00:51:57.990
a scale.

00:51:57.990 --> 00:51:59.470
And then, if you
really go further,

00:51:59.470 --> 00:52:02.220
you can turn it
off and go on so.

00:52:02.220 --> 00:52:02.760
Yeah.

00:52:02.760 --> 00:52:03.307
Amazing.

00:52:03.307 --> 00:52:04.890
That's exactly what
they came up with.

00:52:04.890 --> 00:52:05.848
- So you approve of it?

00:52:05.848 --> 00:52:07.000
You approve of this?

00:52:07.000 --> 00:52:08.230
- Yes.

00:52:08.230 --> 00:52:09.810
I approve of it for teaching.

00:52:09.810 --> 00:52:11.291
And yes.

00:52:11.291 --> 00:52:13.290
That's really what the
Moog people came up with,

00:52:13.290 --> 00:52:14.820
and you just had the same idea.

00:52:14.820 --> 00:52:15.000
- OK.

00:52:15.000 --> 00:52:15.090
Thanks.

00:52:15.090 --> 00:52:15.630
- Excellent.

00:52:15.630 --> 00:52:18.190
Wow.

00:52:18.190 --> 00:52:19.180
- Thank you very much.

00:52:19.180 --> 00:52:21.910
I actually have a question
for your science colleague,

00:52:21.910 --> 00:52:22.881
if that's all right.

00:52:22.881 --> 00:52:23.380
- OK.

00:52:23.380 --> 00:52:23.920
You're putting me on the spot.

00:52:23.920 --> 00:52:25.910
- And it may seem a
little far afield,

00:52:25.910 --> 00:52:28.510
but listening to
your presentation,

00:52:28.510 --> 00:52:30.280
I've always been a
fan of the theremin,

00:52:30.280 --> 00:52:33.310
especially the years I
was living in Budapest.

00:52:33.310 --> 00:52:36.730
But I'm very interested in what
you said about the early use

00:52:36.730 --> 00:52:38.180
for spycraft.

00:52:38.180 --> 00:52:43.240
And thinking about the recent
microwave problems in Havana,

00:52:43.240 --> 00:52:45.280
could you please
help us understand

00:52:45.280 --> 00:52:46.660
if that's related to this?

00:52:46.660 --> 00:52:48.995
Or is there anything you
can offer to us about that?

00:52:48.995 --> 00:52:51.370
- Well, I don't know much--
let me say one thing I missed

00:52:51.370 --> 00:52:52.750
at the beginning.

00:52:52.750 --> 00:52:55.300
I just wanted to sort of fill
out what I should have said.

00:52:55.300 --> 00:52:58.450
So this alarm that
Dorit mentioned,

00:52:58.450 --> 00:53:01.660
it's a whole class of sensors
called proximity sensors.

00:53:01.660 --> 00:53:04.870
And that was the alarm
that used-- so, in a sense,

00:53:04.870 --> 00:53:07.720
you could never enter a
room without broadcasting

00:53:07.720 --> 00:53:10.570
your presence in an
electromagnetic sense.

00:53:10.570 --> 00:53:13.000
And so the idea of
these alarm systems

00:53:13.000 --> 00:53:16.420
was using the
capacitance of your body

00:53:16.420 --> 00:53:19.200
to basically set off the alarm.

00:53:19.200 --> 00:53:21.550
And so that's what got
him thinking about how

00:53:21.550 --> 00:53:23.530
to do this as a theremin.

00:53:23.530 --> 00:53:25.330
I don't know exactly--

00:53:25.330 --> 00:53:26.860
we don't know exactly--

00:53:26.860 --> 00:53:29.050
what was going on
with the embassies.

00:53:29.050 --> 00:53:32.410
But we do know that microwaves--

00:53:32.410 --> 00:53:34.960
just look at what happens
in the oven, right?

00:53:34.960 --> 00:53:37.810
You put something in
the oven, and the way

00:53:37.810 --> 00:53:42.310
a microwave oven works is that
there is a certain frequency

00:53:42.310 --> 00:53:44.170
that excites water molecules.

00:53:44.170 --> 00:53:47.290
And it's close to a certain
microwave frequency.

00:53:47.290 --> 00:53:51.280
So if you have a microwave
oscillator called a klystron,

00:53:51.280 --> 00:53:55.060
and it's tuned to the frequency
of this vibrational state

00:53:55.060 --> 00:53:57.790
in water, it'll heat it up.

00:53:57.790 --> 00:54:01.880
And so our bodies are
mostly made out of water.

00:54:01.880 --> 00:54:07.360
So if you focus a microwave
beam at that frequency

00:54:07.360 --> 00:54:10.720
and point it at somebody,
you can basically

00:54:10.720 --> 00:54:13.460
kill them, or give them
a substantial disruption.

00:54:13.460 --> 00:54:17.020
So my guess-- and I don't
know because, clearly, it's

00:54:17.020 --> 00:54:22.060
classified-- is that there was
some sort of focused microwave

00:54:22.060 --> 00:54:23.950
beam that was developed
by the Russians,

00:54:23.950 --> 00:54:27.040
and then they decided to
test drive it in Havana.

00:54:27.040 --> 00:54:28.030
That's my best guess.

00:54:28.030 --> 00:54:30.880
- The reason I raised it--
it seems very far afield--

00:54:30.880 --> 00:54:34.090
is that the first symptoms
were about ringing and hearing

00:54:34.090 --> 00:54:34.720
sounds.

00:54:34.720 --> 00:54:38.015
And I thought maybe
that was related.

00:54:38.015 --> 00:54:38.890
- Well, I don't know.

00:54:38.890 --> 00:54:40.110
It could be.

00:54:40.110 --> 00:54:42.170
Now that you mention
it, I did see that.

00:54:42.170 --> 00:54:46.140
And so I don't know.

00:54:46.140 --> 00:54:48.640
It could have been
some sort of modulation

00:54:48.640 --> 00:54:51.750
that used some sort of a
resonant frequency in the head.

00:54:51.750 --> 00:54:54.600
Like, maybe what you can do
is tune it until you get--

00:54:54.600 --> 00:54:56.210
you know, when we
produce voices,

00:54:56.210 --> 00:54:57.840
we have different vowel sounds.

00:54:57.840 --> 00:54:59.850
And the vowel sounds
get varied because we

00:54:59.850 --> 00:55:01.766
have the pharynx
as one resonance

00:55:01.766 --> 00:55:04.140
and then, depending on where
the tongue is in your mouth,

00:55:04.140 --> 00:55:05.460
we get another resonance.

00:55:05.460 --> 00:55:07.890
And then, the nasal
cavities have yet another.

00:55:07.890 --> 00:55:11.160
So it's conceivable that maybe
what they're trying to do

00:55:11.160 --> 00:55:14.990
is to make the resonances,
our body resonances,

00:55:14.990 --> 00:55:15.940
go nuts or something.

00:55:15.940 --> 00:55:16.270
- OK.

00:55:16.270 --> 00:55:16.400
Thank you.

00:55:16.400 --> 00:55:17.024
- It's a guess.

00:55:19.890 --> 00:55:24.450
- I imagine with AI,
you could probably

00:55:24.450 --> 00:55:28.590
get a lot of different
robots doing these things.

00:55:28.590 --> 00:55:34.890
And wouldn't it be
possible to visualize

00:55:34.890 --> 00:55:37.890
the function of their
systems, the function

00:55:37.890 --> 00:55:44.850
of our different systems, and
the function of the instrument?

00:55:44.850 --> 00:55:49.260
- I'm not sure exactly--
you mean trying to have

00:55:49.260 --> 00:55:52.673
a mathematical model or
a simulation of that?

00:55:52.673 --> 00:55:53.172
- Right.

00:55:53.172 --> 00:55:56.610
Plot the differences
so you can analyze it.

00:55:56.610 --> 00:55:57.764
- Oh, yeah.

00:55:57.764 --> 00:55:58.430
So I don't know.

00:55:58.430 --> 00:56:02.290
Has anybody produced a robot
who can play the theremin?

00:56:02.290 --> 00:56:03.960
- I've been
fantasizing about this

00:56:03.960 --> 00:56:06.660
and started to work
with someone on that.

00:56:06.660 --> 00:56:09.030
But it's a long-term project.

00:56:09.030 --> 00:56:09.530
But yeah.

00:56:09.530 --> 00:56:11.550
It doesn't-- not to my
knowledge that it exists,

00:56:11.550 --> 00:56:14.761
but I think it should exist.

00:56:14.761 --> 00:56:17.260
Because you could play, maybe,
really well because you would

00:56:17.260 --> 00:56:20.060
have really stable movements.

00:56:20.060 --> 00:56:20.624
- Right.

00:56:20.624 --> 00:56:21.540
So what you could do--

00:56:21.540 --> 00:56:24.260
I'm just riffing on this--
but I could imagine.

00:56:24.260 --> 00:56:26.090
- What would you do
with understanding

00:56:26.090 --> 00:56:29.220
the difference and the
functions of the system, anyway?

00:56:29.220 --> 00:56:32.400
- Well, I think that you would
get much more precise control

00:56:32.400 --> 00:56:33.090
over the sounds.

00:56:33.090 --> 00:56:35.100
Because what would
happen would be,

00:56:35.100 --> 00:56:37.470
there's a certain
feedback between--

00:56:37.470 --> 00:56:39.210
I'd have to ask a
performance artist--

00:56:39.210 --> 00:56:43.140
but I would imagine that there's
some feedback between what

00:56:43.140 --> 00:56:45.090
you're hearing and
where the hand is.

00:56:45.090 --> 00:56:47.820
And so if your hand's a
little off in frequency,

00:56:47.820 --> 00:56:50.740
you would alter it until it
hits the right frequencies.

00:56:50.740 --> 00:56:55.100
And I would imagine, perhaps,
with a robot, because their CPU

00:56:55.100 --> 00:56:59.130
cycles are so much faster, that
they could hit more precisely

00:56:59.130 --> 00:57:02.910
and more quickly that note and
might not have to fall back

00:57:02.910 --> 00:57:05.520
on vibrato to tune things.

00:57:05.520 --> 00:57:11.690
- Well, we tested it
with some automated hand,

00:57:11.690 --> 00:57:13.880
like robot machine hands.

00:57:13.880 --> 00:57:15.990
But it became
apparent very quickly

00:57:15.990 --> 00:57:21.090
that that specific model was
moving too coarse and too fast

00:57:21.090 --> 00:57:24.050
and too jagged.

00:57:24.050 --> 00:57:26.040
I'm talking European
measurements now.

00:57:26.040 --> 00:57:29.700
We're talking about
millimeter distances.

00:57:29.700 --> 00:57:32.320
So I'm sure it could be done.

00:57:32.320 --> 00:57:36.120
But when I tried it
out, that robot hand

00:57:36.120 --> 00:57:38.490
couldn't master the theremin.

00:57:38.490 --> 00:57:39.070
- Yeah.

00:57:39.070 --> 00:57:41.960
So that's an interesting
thought for the future.

00:57:41.960 --> 00:57:44.260
- Well, I was just
wondering, through that kind

00:57:44.260 --> 00:57:48.400
of creativity, could you
find any new information

00:57:48.400 --> 00:57:52.030
about creativity or physics?

00:57:52.030 --> 00:57:56.610
- Information about the
creative process, for example?

00:57:56.610 --> 00:57:57.110
Yeah.

00:57:57.110 --> 00:57:57.890
Could be.

00:57:57.890 --> 00:57:59.930
There are some interesting--

00:57:59.930 --> 00:58:02.480
I don't know it in
a musical context,

00:58:02.480 --> 00:58:08.810
but there is a deep learning
project called DeepDream

00:58:08.810 --> 00:58:11.300
that Google has.

00:58:11.300 --> 00:58:18.020
And what it does is it tries
to do pattern recognition

00:58:18.020 --> 00:58:22.130
and then impose or
reimpose on the image

00:58:22.130 --> 00:58:25.910
that it's been given new
images and twist it around.

00:58:25.910 --> 00:58:30.800
So if you actually google the
word DeepDream, what you can do

00:58:30.800 --> 00:58:33.090
is you can take an image,
deposit it, and then

00:58:33.090 --> 00:58:36.500
it'll run its algorithm and
try to do pattern recognition.

00:58:36.500 --> 00:58:39.770
And so if you take something
like a rocky cliff face

00:58:39.770 --> 00:58:43.954
or kind of the jagged
structure of a gnarly tree

00:58:43.954 --> 00:58:46.370
and you put it through there
several times, what'll emerge

00:58:46.370 --> 00:58:49.760
are the faces of birds
or dogs or reptiles.

00:58:49.760 --> 00:58:52.970
Because the training set
that's been used on that

00:58:52.970 --> 00:58:55.820
is sort of keyed in
to dogs and reptiles

00:58:55.820 --> 00:58:57.350
and that sort of thing.

00:58:57.350 --> 00:58:59.840
So you can imagine
that if you trained

00:58:59.840 --> 00:59:03.760
some sort of deep
learning project

00:59:03.760 --> 00:59:06.740
and you've perfected a robot
that actually can do it

00:59:06.740 --> 00:59:09.530
without these problems,
you could imagine

00:59:09.530 --> 00:59:12.740
that it would impose
its own aesthetic

00:59:12.740 --> 00:59:15.440
and make its own
compositions, which

00:59:15.440 --> 00:59:17.540
is sort of what the deep
learning is getting to.

00:59:17.540 --> 00:59:18.581
But it's not quite there.

00:59:18.581 --> 00:59:21.530
So I would say the robotics
is not up to the task yet.

00:59:21.530 --> 00:59:23.910
And the deep learning is
not up to the task yet.

00:59:23.910 --> 00:59:26.570
But you could imagine that,
at some point in the future,

00:59:26.570 --> 00:59:29.630
the combination of
the two could produce

00:59:29.630 --> 00:59:35.180
its own creative, non-human
way of producing music.

00:59:38.734 --> 00:59:39.400
- Last question?

00:59:42.037 --> 00:59:43.620
- Could you tell a
little more about--

00:59:43.620 --> 00:59:46.210
I understand that
he married a dancer

00:59:46.210 --> 00:59:48.520
and then tried to
see if a dancer could

00:59:48.520 --> 00:59:51.490
dance within a field.

00:59:51.490 --> 00:59:52.690
- Oh, yeah.

00:59:52.690 --> 00:59:53.380
Yeah.

00:59:53.380 --> 00:59:57.130
Lev Theremin, while
he was in New York,

00:59:57.130 --> 01:00:00.550
he also worked on
the terpsitone, which

01:00:00.550 --> 01:00:04.060
is a theremin made for dancers.

01:00:04.060 --> 01:00:08.290
And maybe it was inspired by
his wife, Lavinia Williams.

01:00:08.290 --> 01:00:13.810
But it seemed that nobody really
could control the terpsitone.

01:00:13.810 --> 01:00:16.990
Because again, the
body would just

01:00:16.990 --> 01:00:21.910
move too much to really turn
it into a melodic device.

01:00:21.910 --> 01:00:26.110
There is, right now, a
project in Paris premiering

01:00:26.110 --> 01:00:27.400
at the Pompidou.

01:00:27.400 --> 01:00:28.900
And I'm very happy about it.

01:00:28.900 --> 01:00:32.920
It features seven terpsitones
and three dancers.

01:00:32.920 --> 01:00:35.980
And I was helping with
the consultation--

01:00:35.980 --> 01:00:39.790
because they really didn't
understand it's all about

01:00:39.790 --> 01:00:46.480
calibrating the theremin, like
setting the size of the fields

01:00:46.480 --> 01:00:49.750
which you can do of the
pitch of the volume--

01:00:49.750 --> 01:00:54.390
and so help them
to understand which

01:00:54.390 --> 01:00:58.000
distances work for them and
the kind of things they can do.

01:00:58.000 --> 01:01:00.610
So it's ambitiously
being applied again.

01:01:00.610 --> 01:01:04.640
But to turn that musical
is very difficult.

01:01:04.640 --> 01:01:07.960
One of my favorite inventions
that Lev Theremin also did,

01:01:07.960 --> 01:01:09.850
aside from all the
things we mentioned,

01:01:09.850 --> 01:01:13.930
is the rhythmicon, which is
a huge, clunky rhythm machine

01:01:13.930 --> 01:01:17.200
that couldn't hold the beat.

01:01:17.200 --> 01:01:18.220
I think that's very--

01:01:18.220 --> 01:01:20.470
and it sounds like a
Frankenstein device.

01:01:20.470 --> 01:01:22.360
Anyway, any other questions?

01:01:22.360 --> 01:01:23.680
Oh, thank you.

01:01:23.680 --> 01:01:27.010
- Well, I have to
say without hyperbole

01:01:27.010 --> 01:01:28.930
that the theremin is cool.

01:01:28.930 --> 01:01:30.058
That was great.

01:01:30.058 --> 01:01:33.544
[APPLAUSE]

01:01:36.540 --> 01:01:37.920
I'd like to thank John.

01:01:37.920 --> 01:01:40.290
Thank you, John, for
being the science guy

01:01:40.290 --> 01:01:44.730
and explaining to us how this
marvelous piece of equipment--

01:01:44.730 --> 01:01:46.200
beautiful machine-- works.

01:01:46.200 --> 01:01:48.270
And Dorit, you're amazing.

01:01:48.270 --> 01:01:51.100
That was fantastic.

01:01:51.100 --> 01:01:53.032
Thank you for sharing
the theremin with us.

01:01:53.032 --> 01:01:54.240
And thank you all for coming.

01:01:54.240 --> 01:01:58.290
And make sure you register
for the other lectures

01:01:58.290 --> 01:02:00.030
in the Series for
the Undiscovered.

01:02:00.030 --> 01:02:02.520
And given the
enthusiasm today, I

01:02:02.520 --> 01:02:05.970
think it's going to be a great
year for the Radcliffe events.

01:02:05.970 --> 01:02:06.570
[APPLAUSE]

01:02:06.570 --> 01:02:10.220
