00:00:00.370 --> 00:00:03.484
Let's, let's contrast and compare a little bit here. What I find interesting is

00:00:03.484 --> 00:00:07.189
that there's the game industry where we we see that a lot, because the games

00:00:07.189 --> 00:00:11.467
out there. and there's sort of computer aided design, which is sort of a

00:00:11.467 --> 00:00:14.616
different kind of a graphics, different kind of a 3D computer graphics way of

00:00:14.616 --> 00:00:19.141
doing things. So, well for starters, what, what, what would you say is the

00:00:19.141 --> 00:00:22.609
biggest difference between sort of games programming and computer-aided design

00:00:22.609 --> 00:00:24.294
programming?

00:00:24.294 --> 00:00:29.105
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; I think the end result is, is the big difference. In that, if you were playing

00:00:29.105 --> 00:00:31.940
a game and something happened with the visuals, you know, a frame or two goes

00:00:31.940 --> 00:00:35.220
off. The worse that happens is your avatar dies.

00:00:35.220 --> 00:00:39.456
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; If you mess up in a computer aided design package, people can die. It's[LAUGH],

00:00:39.456 --> 00:00:43.173
it's just that there's, there's much more, I think I have much more invested

00:00:43.173 --> 00:00:48.118
in, in Autocad, because of the importance of the work that it does.

00:00:48.118 --> 00:00:50.575
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Well with game design, it's, it's kind of a a limited field, in a sense, in

00:00:50.575 --> 00:00:52.954
that, they're in total control over the product, and there's a whole team

00:00:52.954 --> 00:00:54.935
working on that.

00:00:54.935 --> 00:00:57.973
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Your product is different in the sense that you're selling it to people and

00:00:57.973 --> 00:01:02.700
they're using it for who knows what. Can you tell us some of the differences

00:01:02.700 --> 00:01:02.744
there?

00:01:02.744 --> 00:01:07.457
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Well, like I say, in games, the world and the behavior is fairly static. The

00:01:07.457 --> 00:01:11.115
things happen and things can move around and change, but in general, like I

00:01:11.115 --> 00:01:14.596
said, there's a lot of control that The, the game designers and the game

00:01:14.596 --> 00:01:20.819
programmers have over what's going on in the game. Whereas with the CAD system,

00:01:20.819 --> 00:01:25.219
our users can do pretty much anything. And an interesting this is that CAD

00:01:25.219 --> 00:01:30.140
systems, you can view it as a way of creating content. So people can actually

00:01:30.140 --> 00:01:33.980
write games using a CAD system to design the assests for the game And then play

00:01:33.980 --> 00:01:39.752
the game. So, they can, they can almost interact with each other that way. But

00:01:39.752 --> 00:01:43.580
you need a lot more flexibility within, your, the CAD package or what, whatever

00:01:43.580 --> 00:01:48.554
package you're using to design the assets for the game. Once you get into the

00:01:48.554 --> 00:01:51.626
game they're a lot of tricks that programmers play and artists in order to, to

00:01:51.626 --> 00:01:56.810
fake things out and for, get whatever you need done. Again, you can also deal

00:01:56.810 --> 00:01:59.900
with the fact that if you're a little bit off one frame, it won't hap, won't

00:01:59.900 --> 00:02:02.225
really matter because the action is moving quickly enough that you'll get right

00:02:02.225 --> 00:02:04.289
past it.

00:02:04.289 --> 00:02:07.300
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Right. I mean, just the fact that there's a reality to, you know, whatever

00:02:07.300 --> 00:02:10.515
you're, whatever you're building, makes sense that there's, you know, Autocad

00:02:10.515 --> 00:02:15.273
and so on. It really has sort of different kinds of constraints. well with

00:02:15.273 --> 00:02:16.925
that, for example, I mean

00:02:16.925 --> 00:02:21.700
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Are their constraints as far as precision or elements like that.

00:02:21.700 --> 00:02:24.346
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Well, definitely we, we have to deal with things like, we have this one model

00:02:24.346 --> 00:02:27.466
that we use internally for a lot of testing which is the model of the solar

00:02:27.466 --> 00:02:35.276
system. So we have to have auto cad be able to go all the way from the, looking

00:02:35.276 --> 00:02:41.396
at the entire solar system down to looking at a plaque on the moon that was

00:02:41.396 --> 00:02:47.113
left by Neil Armstrong.

00:02:47.113 --> 00:02:49.900
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; [LAUGH]

00:02:49.900 --> 00:02:52.426
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; And we need to be able to read the lettering on that plaque. So just the range

00:02:52.426 --> 00:02:53.970
of precision that we have to deal with can, can really blow away a lot of the

00:02:53.970 --> 00:02:59.094
graphics hardware, so again, there're some tricks that you have to play in

00:02:53.779 --> 00:02:54.483
order to be able to handle the all that different resolution with only single

00:02:54.483 --> 00:02:55.500
precision floating point.

00:02:55.500 --> 00:02:56.325
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Can't break it.

00:02:56.325 --> 00:02:58.957
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; The nice thing is, that we're dealing with soft, we had our software

00:02:58.957 --> 00:03:02.800
implementation. Of course we had double precision, we could deal with it much

00:03:02.800 --> 00:03:07.300
better but, when you, when your end result really requires single precision.

00:03:07.300 --> 00:03:08.790
That's where it gets tricky.
