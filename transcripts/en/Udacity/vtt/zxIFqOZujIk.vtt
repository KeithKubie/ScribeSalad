00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.000
The answer is, given the assumptions here, P must not be prime.

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:08.000
And the reason for that is P is greater than Pn.

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:11.000
And we said this set includes all prime numbers--

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:15.000
that's the assumption we started with for this proof,

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:17.000
and this number's the product of many numbers--

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:19.000
all of these are positive, adding 1 to it.

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:22.000
So the value of P must be greater that P sub N

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:26.000
and that means, according to our assumption about the limited set of all primes,

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:28.000
P must not be prime.

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:31.000
So since P is not a prime, that means it must be a composite--

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:37.000
which means it must be the product of some prime number and some other integer.

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:40.000
So that means we can write P as some prime,

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:42.000
and we've said all the primes are in this set,

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:44.000
so it's something selected from that set,

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:47.000
multiplied by some other number--we don't know what Q is

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:49.000
other than it must be an integer.

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:54.000
So now we have P, which we computed as the product of all these primes plus 1

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:59.000
which is equal to some prime from that set times Q.
