today's video is about a game you start

00:00:02.270 --> 00:00:02.280
today's video is about a game you start
 

00:00:02.280 --> 00:00:04.400
today's video is about a game you start
off with a deck of playing cards that

00:00:04.400 --> 00:00:04.410
off with a deck of playing cards that
 

00:00:04.410 --> 00:00:05.690
off with a deck of playing cards that
you actually instead of shuffling it

00:00:05.690 --> 00:00:05.700
you actually instead of shuffling it
 

00:00:05.700 --> 00:00:08.480
you actually instead of shuffling it
normally you flip a half of it over

00:00:08.480 --> 00:00:08.490
normally you flip a half of it over
 

00:00:08.490 --> 00:00:10.879
normally you flip a half of it over
every time you shuffle so that some of

00:00:10.879 --> 00:00:10.889
every time you shuffle so that some of
 

00:00:10.889 --> 00:00:12.499
every time you shuffle so that some of
the cards are going to wind up face-up

00:00:12.499 --> 00:00:12.509
the cards are going to wind up face-up
 

00:00:12.509 --> 00:00:14.539
the cards are going to wind up face-up
and some of them are gonna wind up

00:00:14.539 --> 00:00:14.549
and some of them are gonna wind up
 

00:00:14.549 --> 00:00:16.730
and some of them are gonna wind up
facedown

00:00:16.730 --> 00:00:16.740
facedown
 

00:00:16.740 --> 00:00:18.140
facedown
thank you I actually have to do it a

00:00:18.140 --> 00:00:18.150
thank you I actually have to do it a
 

00:00:18.150 --> 00:00:20.450
thank you I actually have to do it a
bunch of times because I truly want to

00:00:20.450 --> 00:00:20.460
bunch of times because I truly want to
 

00:00:20.460 --> 00:00:23.840
bunch of times because I truly want to
be randomized if it's face up or face

00:00:23.840 --> 00:00:23.850
be randomized if it's face up or face
 

00:00:23.850 --> 00:00:26.810
be randomized if it's face up or face
down so I don't want exactly 50/50 I

00:00:26.810 --> 00:00:26.820
down so I don't want exactly 50/50 I
 

00:00:26.820 --> 00:00:30.550
down so I don't want exactly 50/50 I
want them to be up or down as they may

00:00:30.550 --> 00:00:30.560
want them to be up or down as they may
 

00:00:30.560 --> 00:00:33.170
want them to be up or down as they may
then you pick a number and we're gonna

00:00:33.170 --> 00:00:33.180
then you pick a number and we're gonna
 

00:00:33.180 --> 00:00:35.569
then you pick a number and we're gonna
do it first with a small number so give

00:00:35.569 --> 00:00:35.579
do it first with a small number so give
 

00:00:35.579 --> 00:00:38.420
do it first with a small number so give
me a number between say 5 and 10 that's

00:00:38.420 --> 00:00:38.430
me a number between say 5 and 10 that's
 

00:00:38.430 --> 00:00:42.350
me a number between say 5 and 10 that's
scary 4 6 sex so you lay out 6 cards in

00:00:42.350 --> 00:00:42.360
scary 4 6 sex so you lay out 6 cards in
 

00:00:42.360 --> 00:00:46.330
scary 4 6 sex so you lay out 6 cards in
a row with the edges touching each other

00:00:46.330 --> 00:00:46.340
a row with the edges touching each other
 

00:00:46.340 --> 00:00:49.369
a row with the edges touching each other
the objective of the game is to wipe the

00:00:49.369 --> 00:00:49.379
the objective of the game is to wipe the
 

00:00:49.379 --> 00:00:50.930
the objective of the game is to wipe the
table of all the cards the way the game

00:00:50.930 --> 00:00:50.940
table of all the cards the way the game
 

00:00:50.940 --> 00:00:53.299
table of all the cards the way the game
is played is you can draw out a card

00:00:53.299 --> 00:00:53.309
is played is you can draw out a card
 

00:00:53.309 --> 00:00:56.209
is played is you can draw out a card
only when it's face up so right now I've

00:00:56.209 --> 00:00:56.219
only when it's face up so right now I've
 

00:00:56.219 --> 00:00:58.819
only when it's face up so right now I've
got 3 choices for which car that could

00:00:58.819 --> 00:00:58.829
got 3 choices for which car that could
 

00:00:58.829 --> 00:01:00.529
got 3 choices for which car that could
start by drawing out and the second rule

00:01:00.529 --> 00:01:00.539
start by drawing out and the second rule
 

00:01:00.539 --> 00:01:02.510
start by drawing out and the second rule
is that when you draw the card if it's

00:01:02.510 --> 00:01:02.520
is that when you draw the card if it's
 

00:01:02.520 --> 00:01:04.429
is that when you draw the card if it's
still touching either of its neighbors

00:01:04.429 --> 00:01:04.439
still touching either of its neighbors
 

00:01:04.439 --> 00:01:06.620
still touching either of its neighbors
if you flip over any of its remaining

00:01:06.620 --> 00:01:06.630
if you flip over any of its remaining
 

00:01:06.630 --> 00:01:07.850
if you flip over any of its remaining
neighbors so anything that's still

00:01:07.850 --> 00:01:07.860
neighbors so anything that's still
 

00:01:07.860 --> 00:01:10.010
neighbors so anything that's still
touching it gets flipped over how do you

00:01:10.010 --> 00:01:10.020
touching it gets flipped over how do you
 

00:01:10.020 --> 00:01:11.420
touching it gets flipped over how do you
choose your first card well it's kind of

00:01:11.420 --> 00:01:11.430
choose your first card well it's kind of
 

00:01:11.430 --> 00:01:13.640
choose your first card well it's kind of
like solitaire you wanna strategize so

00:01:13.640 --> 00:01:13.650
like solitaire you wanna strategize so
 

00:01:13.650 --> 00:01:17.149
like solitaire you wanna strategize so
that you win the game if you choose the

00:01:17.149 --> 00:01:17.159
that you win the game if you choose the
 

00:01:17.159 --> 00:01:18.770
that you win the game if you choose the
wrong card that's possible to mess the

00:01:18.770 --> 00:01:18.780
wrong card that's possible to mess the
 

00:01:18.780 --> 00:01:20.539
wrong card that's possible to mess the
whole thing up and winds up losing say I

00:01:20.539 --> 00:01:20.549
whole thing up and winds up losing say I
 

00:01:20.549 --> 00:01:23.420
whole thing up and winds up losing say I
choose this card right here so I draw it

00:01:23.420 --> 00:01:23.430
choose this card right here so I draw it
 

00:01:23.430 --> 00:01:26.749
choose this card right here so I draw it
out flip over both of its neighbors but

00:01:26.749 --> 00:01:26.759
out flip over both of its neighbors but
 

00:01:26.759 --> 00:01:29.090
out flip over both of its neighbors but
now this little island right here is

00:01:29.090 --> 00:01:29.100
now this little island right here is
 

00:01:29.100 --> 00:01:31.640
now this little island right here is
actually stuck no chance of either of

00:01:31.640 --> 00:01:31.650
actually stuck no chance of either of
 

00:01:31.650 --> 00:01:33.080
actually stuck no chance of either of
these cards getting flipped over I can't

00:01:33.080 --> 00:01:33.090
these cards getting flipped over I can't
 

00:01:33.090 --> 00:01:34.280
these cards getting flipped over I can't
pull them out I'm gonna lose the game if

00:01:34.280 --> 00:01:34.290
pull them out I'm gonna lose the game if
 

00:01:34.290 --> 00:01:36.679
pull them out I'm gonna lose the game if
you're going to play the game to win

00:01:36.679 --> 00:01:36.689
you're going to play the game to win
 

00:01:36.689 --> 00:01:38.210
you're going to play the game to win
you want to strategize a bit and then

00:01:38.210 --> 00:01:38.220
you want to strategize a bit and then
 

00:01:38.220 --> 00:01:40.069
you want to strategize a bit and then
let's say we start off with this Queen

00:01:40.069 --> 00:01:40.079
let's say we start off with this Queen
 

00:01:40.079 --> 00:01:42.649
let's say we start off with this Queen
we draw her out flip over the two

00:01:42.649 --> 00:01:42.659
we draw her out flip over the two
 

00:01:42.659 --> 00:01:44.389
we draw her out flip over the two
neighbors this is isolated but we can

00:01:44.389 --> 00:01:44.399
neighbors this is isolated but we can
 

00:01:44.399 --> 00:01:46.429
neighbors this is isolated but we can
draw this one out and then let's go

00:01:46.429 --> 00:01:46.439
draw this one out and then let's go
 

00:01:46.439 --> 00:01:48.950
draw this one out and then let's go
ahead and draw this end flip over this

00:01:48.950 --> 00:01:48.960
ahead and draw this end flip over this
 

00:01:48.960 --> 00:01:51.920
ahead and draw this end flip over this
two then draw this jacket flip over his

00:01:51.920 --> 00:01:51.930
two then draw this jacket flip over his
 

00:01:51.930 --> 00:01:54.469
two then draw this jacket flip over his
neighbors and we can draw out each of

00:01:54.469 --> 00:01:54.479
neighbors and we can draw out each of
 

00:01:54.479 --> 00:01:58.670
neighbors and we can draw out each of
these remaining two cards now I'm going

00:01:58.670 --> 00:01:58.680
these remaining two cards now I'm going
 

00:01:58.680 --> 00:02:01.340
these remaining two cards now I'm going
to deal out another six cards and see if

00:02:01.340 --> 00:02:01.350
to deal out another six cards and see if
 

00:02:01.350 --> 00:02:03.350
to deal out another six cards and see if
we can win the second game all right now

00:02:03.350 --> 00:02:03.360
we can win the second game all right now
 

00:02:03.360 --> 00:02:05.420
we can win the second game all right now
I can tell you right now this game is

00:02:05.420 --> 00:02:05.430
I can tell you right now this game is
 

00:02:05.430 --> 00:02:08.119
I can tell you right now this game is
not winnable even if I played with

00:02:08.119 --> 00:02:08.129
not winnable even if I played with
 

00:02:08.129 --> 00:02:10.639
not winnable even if I played with
optimum strategy nothing will work if I

00:02:10.639 --> 00:02:10.649
optimum strategy nothing will work if I
 

00:02:10.649 --> 00:02:13.460
optimum strategy nothing will work if I
try to remove this King

00:02:13.460 --> 00:02:13.470
try to remove this King
 

00:02:13.470 --> 00:02:16.040
try to remove this King
then it would flip over these two cards

00:02:16.040 --> 00:02:16.050
then it would flip over these two cards
 

00:02:16.050 --> 00:02:17.600
then it would flip over these two cards
and I can already see I've made a

00:02:17.600 --> 00:02:17.610
and I can already see I've made a
 

00:02:17.610 --> 00:02:19.910
and I can already see I've made a
mistake because this Islands over here

00:02:19.910 --> 00:02:19.920
mistake because this Islands over here
 

00:02:19.920 --> 00:02:21.440
mistake because this Islands over here
is never going to be able to be removed

00:02:21.440 --> 00:02:21.450
is never going to be able to be removed
 

00:02:21.450 --> 00:02:24.500
is never going to be able to be removed
so let me undo that if I try that say

00:02:24.500 --> 00:02:24.510
so let me undo that if I try that say
 

00:02:24.510 --> 00:02:28.340
so let me undo that if I try that say
this ten instead then I am going to be

00:02:28.340 --> 00:02:28.350
this ten instead then I am going to be
 

00:02:28.350 --> 00:02:30.140
this ten instead then I am going to be
able to remove this last card in the

00:02:30.140 --> 00:02:30.150
able to remove this last card in the
 

00:02:30.150 --> 00:02:35.300
able to remove this last card in the
islands now if I remove this club remove

00:02:35.300 --> 00:02:35.310
islands now if I remove this club remove
 

00:02:35.310 --> 00:02:37.250
islands now if I remove this club remove
the king but whichever of these two

00:02:37.250 --> 00:02:37.260
the king but whichever of these two
 

00:02:37.260 --> 00:02:40.220
the king but whichever of these two
cards I remove remove the two flip over

00:02:40.220 --> 00:02:40.230
cards I remove remove the two flip over
 

00:02:40.230 --> 00:02:43.460
cards I remove remove the two flip over
this Chaka if I remove the jack you'll

00:02:43.460 --> 00:02:43.470
this Chaka if I remove the jack you'll
 

00:02:43.470 --> 00:02:45.110
this Chaka if I remove the jack you'll
flip over this two and stuck forever

00:02:45.110 --> 00:02:45.120
flip over this two and stuck forever
 

00:02:45.120 --> 00:02:47.870
flip over this two and stuck forever
trust me you can't win this one so if

00:02:47.870 --> 00:02:47.880
trust me you can't win this one so if
 

00:02:47.880 --> 00:02:50.330
trust me you can't win this one so if
you're playing this game and you can

00:02:50.330 --> 00:02:50.340
you're playing this game and you can
 

00:02:50.340 --> 00:02:52.130
you're playing this game and you can
choose any number of cards to play with

00:02:52.130 --> 00:02:52.140
choose any number of cards to play with
 

00:02:52.140 --> 00:02:54.110
choose any number of cards to play with
what's the probability that you wind up

00:02:54.110 --> 00:02:54.120
what's the probability that you wind up
 

00:02:54.120 --> 00:02:55.610
what's the probability that you wind up
with a game that's impossible no matter

00:02:55.610 --> 00:02:55.620
with a game that's impossible no matter
 

00:02:55.620 --> 00:02:57.770
with a game that's impossible no matter
how well you play I've seen three

00:02:57.770 --> 00:02:57.780
how well you play I've seen three
 

00:02:57.780 --> 00:02:59.840
how well you play I've seen three
different beautiful proofs of us two of

00:02:59.840 --> 00:02:59.850
different beautiful proofs of us two of
 

00:02:59.850 --> 00:03:01.610
different beautiful proofs of us two of
them are very formal two of them are the

00:03:01.610 --> 00:03:01.620
them are very formal two of them are the
 

00:03:01.620 --> 00:03:03.290
them are very formal two of them are the
kinds of proof that if you're familiar

00:03:03.290 --> 00:03:03.300
kinds of proof that if you're familiar
 

00:03:03.300 --> 00:03:06.650
kinds of proof that if you're familiar
with inductive strategy proof or

00:03:06.650 --> 00:03:06.660
with inductive strategy proof or
 

00:03:06.660 --> 00:03:09.290
with inductive strategy proof or
breaking down a large game into smaller

00:03:09.290 --> 00:03:09.300
breaking down a large game into smaller
 

00:03:09.300 --> 00:03:12.800
breaking down a large game into smaller
parts you can do fairly like it formal

00:03:12.800 --> 00:03:12.810
parts you can do fairly like it formal
 

00:03:12.810 --> 00:03:14.900
parts you can do fairly like it formal
proofs that way but I'm going to show

00:03:14.900 --> 00:03:14.910
proofs that way but I'm going to show
 

00:03:14.910 --> 00:03:17.720
proofs that way but I'm going to show
you a proof that is based on jigsaw

00:03:17.720 --> 00:03:17.730
you a proof that is based on jigsaw
 

00:03:17.730 --> 00:03:20.510
you a proof that is based on jigsaw
puzzle pieces instead of the one that it

00:03:20.510 --> 00:03:20.520
puzzle pieces instead of the one that it
 

00:03:20.520 --> 00:03:22.370
puzzle pieces instead of the one that it
was the first proof I ever wrote mmm I

00:03:22.370 --> 00:03:22.380
was the first proof I ever wrote mmm I
 

00:03:22.380 --> 00:03:25.160
was the first proof I ever wrote mmm I
have some I guess nostalgia for it

00:03:25.160 --> 00:03:25.170
have some I guess nostalgia for it
 

00:03:25.170 --> 00:03:28.490
have some I guess nostalgia for it
because of that so spoiler if you play

00:03:28.490 --> 00:03:28.500
because of that so spoiler if you play
 

00:03:28.500 --> 00:03:30.080
because of that so spoiler if you play
this game a million times you'll find

00:03:30.080 --> 00:03:30.090
this game a million times you'll find
 

00:03:30.090 --> 00:03:32.360
this game a million times you'll find
that approximately half of those times

00:03:32.360 --> 00:03:32.370
that approximately half of those times
 

00:03:32.370 --> 00:03:33.979
that approximately half of those times
that you'll be able to win it playing

00:03:33.979 --> 00:03:33.989
that you'll be able to win it playing
 

00:03:33.989 --> 00:03:36.500
that you'll be able to win it playing
perfectly and half the times you'll have

00:03:36.500 --> 00:03:36.510
perfectly and half the times you'll have
 

00:03:36.510 --> 00:03:38.900
perfectly and half the times you'll have
laid out a scenario that's impossible to

laid out a scenario that's impossible to
 

00:03:38.910 --> 00:03:40.940
laid out a scenario that's impossible to
ever win can you tell by looking at it I

00:03:40.940 --> 00:03:40.950
ever win can you tell by looking at it I
 

00:03:40.950 --> 00:03:44.330
ever win can you tell by looking at it I
can I can tell just by scanning across

00:03:44.330 --> 00:03:44.340
can I can tell just by scanning across
 

00:03:44.340 --> 00:03:46.070
can I can tell just by scanning across
the cards once what are you looking for

00:03:46.070 --> 00:03:46.080
the cards once what are you looking for
 

00:03:46.080 --> 00:03:47.210
the cards once what are you looking for
what are you looking at to give it away

00:03:47.210 --> 00:03:47.220
what are you looking at to give it away
 

00:03:47.220 --> 00:03:48.830
what are you looking at to give it away
we're not telling me you're looking

00:03:48.830 --> 00:03:48.840
we're not telling me you're looking
 

00:03:48.840 --> 00:03:50.750
we're not telling me you're looking
specifically at the number of faceoff

00:03:50.750 --> 00:03:50.760
specifically at the number of faceoff
 

00:03:50.760 --> 00:03:52.580
specifically at the number of faceoff
cards and you're looking to see if

00:03:52.580 --> 00:03:52.590
cards and you're looking to see if
 

00:03:52.590 --> 00:03:54.740
cards and you're looking to see if
there's an even number of them or an odd

00:03:54.740 --> 00:03:54.750
there's an even number of them or an odd
 

00:03:54.750 --> 00:03:56.570
there's an even number of them or an odd
number of them total and if they're an

00:03:56.570 --> 00:03:56.580
number of them total and if they're an
 

00:03:56.580 --> 00:03:59.630
number of them total and if they're an
even number of them then you're very sad

00:03:59.630 --> 00:03:59.640
even number of them then you're very sad
 

00:03:59.640 --> 00:04:02.960
even number of them then you're very sad
or you say Deal again if they're an odd

00:04:02.960 --> 00:04:02.970
or you say Deal again if they're an odd
 

00:04:02.970 --> 00:04:05.120
or you say Deal again if they're an odd
number you give the green light and you

00:04:05.120 --> 00:04:05.130
number you give the green light and you
 

00:04:05.130 --> 00:04:06.920
number you give the green light and you
try to play it let's try a slightly

00:04:06.920 --> 00:04:06.930
try to play it let's try a slightly
 

00:04:06.930 --> 00:04:08.810
try to play it let's try a slightly
larger game this time can you pick a

00:04:08.810 --> 00:04:08.820
larger game this time can you pick a
 

00:04:08.820 --> 00:04:11.780
larger game this time can you pick a
number between ten and twenty thirteen

00:04:11.780 --> 00:04:11.790
number between ten and twenty thirteen
 

00:04:11.790 --> 00:04:14.030
number between ten and twenty thirteen
thirteen all right thirteen cards

00:04:14.030 --> 00:04:14.040
thirteen all right thirteen cards
 

00:04:14.040 --> 00:04:16.310
thirteen all right thirteen cards
so there's five because they're an odd

00:04:16.310 --> 00:04:16.320
so there's five because they're an odd
 

00:04:16.320 --> 00:04:18.349
so there's five because they're an odd
number of face-up cards if you play this

00:04:18.349 --> 00:04:18.359
number of face-up cards if you play this
 

00:04:18.359 --> 00:04:21.550
number of face-up cards if you play this
perfectly you'll be able to win prove it

00:04:21.550 --> 00:04:21.560
perfectly you'll be able to win prove it
 

00:04:21.560 --> 00:04:23.990
perfectly you'll be able to win prove it
excellent so I'm actually gonna do more

00:04:23.990 --> 00:04:24.000
excellent so I'm actually gonna do more
 

00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:26.540
excellent so I'm actually gonna do more
than just prove that this game is what I

00:04:26.540 --> 00:04:26.550
than just prove that this game is what I
 

00:04:26.550 --> 00:04:27.260
than just prove that this game is what I
could do that

00:04:27.260 --> 00:04:27.270
could do that
 

00:04:27.270 --> 00:04:28.969
could do that
by playing it and showing you that

00:04:28.969 --> 00:04:28.979
by playing it and showing you that
 

00:04:28.979 --> 00:04:31.129
by playing it and showing you that
Quentin instead that I'm going to show

00:04:31.129 --> 00:04:31.139
Quentin instead that I'm going to show
 

00:04:31.139 --> 00:04:33.170
Quentin instead that I'm going to show
you a way to prove that for any odd

00:04:33.170 --> 00:04:33.180
you a way to prove that for any odd
 

00:04:33.180 --> 00:04:35.600
you a way to prove that for any odd
number of face-up cards you can win that

00:04:35.600 --> 00:04:35.610
number of face-up cards you can win that
 

00:04:35.610 --> 00:04:39.140
number of face-up cards you can win that
game I could start with this card right

00:04:39.140 --> 00:04:39.150
game I could start with this card right
 

00:04:39.150 --> 00:04:41.809
game I could start with this card right
here and that would flip both of its

00:04:41.809 --> 00:04:41.819
here and that would flip both of its
 

00:04:41.819 --> 00:04:45.920
here and that would flip both of its
neighbors then this card then that would

00:04:45.920 --> 00:04:45.930
neighbors then this card then that would
 

00:04:45.930 --> 00:04:47.659
neighbors then this card then that would
flip this one over so that could be my

00:04:47.659 --> 00:04:47.669
flip this one over so that could be my
 

00:04:47.669 --> 00:04:51.499
flip this one over so that could be my
third okay say I go down here for the

00:04:51.499 --> 00:04:51.509
third okay say I go down here for the
 

00:04:51.509 --> 00:04:53.719
third okay say I go down here for the
fifth and here's something that I really

00:04:53.719 --> 00:04:53.729
fifth and here's something that I really
 

00:04:53.729 --> 00:04:55.550
fifth and here's something that I really
love is going to happen to draw this

00:04:55.550 --> 00:04:55.560
love is going to happen to draw this
 

00:04:55.560 --> 00:04:57.619
love is going to happen to draw this
card you wind up with what I think of as

00:04:57.619 --> 00:04:57.629
card you wind up with what I think of as
 

00:04:57.629 --> 00:04:59.870
card you wind up with what I think of as
a fuse going down to the left it just

00:04:59.870 --> 00:04:59.880
a fuse going down to the left it just
 

00:04:59.880 --> 00:05:02.570
a fuse going down to the left it just
kind of burns down that straight and

00:05:02.570 --> 00:05:02.580
kind of burns down that straight and
 

00:05:02.580 --> 00:05:04.399
kind of burns down that straight and
that could also burn off to the right so

00:05:04.399 --> 00:05:04.409
that could also burn off to the right so
 

00:05:04.409 --> 00:05:07.010
that could also burn off to the right so
say this is five and go ahead and call

00:05:07.010 --> 00:05:07.020
say this is five and go ahead and call
 

00:05:07.020 --> 00:05:11.149
say this is five and go ahead and call
this six seven eight then this card

00:05:11.149 --> 00:05:11.159
this six seven eight then this card
 

00:05:11.159 --> 00:05:13.700
this six seven eight then this card
right here next I'll burn down this

00:05:13.700 --> 00:05:13.710
right here next I'll burn down this
 

00:05:13.710 --> 00:05:18.020
right here next I'll burn down this
Trika ten eleven twelve thirteen I can

00:05:18.020 --> 00:05:18.030
Trika ten eleven twelve thirteen I can
 

00:05:18.030 --> 00:05:20.360
Trika ten eleven twelve thirteen I can
remove this in this order and just show

00:05:20.360 --> 00:05:20.370
remove this in this order and just show
 

00:05:20.370 --> 00:05:21.920
remove this in this order and just show
and you can like move my hands super

00:05:21.920 --> 00:05:21.930
and you can like move my hands super
 

00:05:21.930 --> 00:05:22.470
and you can like move my hands super
fast

00:05:22.470 --> 00:05:22.480

well success all right cool
let's reload it now let's look at the

00:05:42.860 --> 00:05:42.870
let's reload it now let's look at the
 

00:05:42.870 --> 00:05:46.250
let's reload it now let's look at the
proof for why any are the number of

00:05:46.250 --> 00:05:46.260
proof for why any are the number of
 

00:05:46.260 --> 00:05:48.410
proof for why any are the number of
face-up cards can be one so if you look

00:05:48.410 --> 00:05:48.420
face-up cards can be one so if you look
 

00:05:48.420 --> 00:05:50.780
face-up cards can be one so if you look
at this particular sequence you can see

00:05:50.780 --> 00:05:50.790
at this particular sequence you can see
 

00:05:50.790 --> 00:05:53.210
at this particular sequence you can see
that follows two rules that match the

00:05:53.210 --> 00:05:53.220
that follows two rules that match the
 

00:05:53.220 --> 00:05:55.730
that follows two rules that match the
rules of the game mainly that if I've

00:05:55.730 --> 00:05:55.740
rules of the game mainly that if I've
 

00:05:55.740 --> 00:05:59.180
rules of the game mainly that if I've
got a face-up card then I can draw that

00:05:59.180 --> 00:05:59.190
got a face-up card then I can draw that
 

00:05:59.190 --> 00:06:02.000
got a face-up card then I can draw that
before either of its neighbors or I can

00:06:02.000 --> 00:06:02.010
before either of its neighbors or I can
 

00:06:02.010 --> 00:06:04.190
before either of its neighbors or I can
draw that after both of its neighbors

00:06:04.190 --> 00:06:04.200
draw that after both of its neighbors
 

00:06:04.200 --> 00:06:06.350
draw that after both of its neighbors
but if I've drawn out one of its

00:06:06.350 --> 00:06:06.360
but if I've drawn out one of its
 

00:06:06.360 --> 00:06:07.310
but if I've drawn out one of its
neighbors and not the other

00:06:07.310 --> 00:06:07.320
neighbors and not the other
 

00:06:07.320 --> 00:06:10.370
neighbors and not the other
it'll be flipped over and it's taka so 5

00:06:10.370 --> 00:06:10.380
it'll be flipped over and it's taka so 5
 

00:06:10.380 --> 00:06:13.340
it'll be flipped over and it's taka so 5
is less than both 10 and 6 because of

00:06:13.340 --> 00:06:13.350
is less than both 10 and 6 because of
 

00:06:13.350 --> 00:06:16.190
is less than both 10 and 6 because of
this if a card is face down then it's

00:06:16.190 --> 00:06:16.200
this if a card is face down then it's
 

00:06:16.200 --> 00:06:18.920
this if a card is face down then it's
stuck initially but if I draw one of its

00:06:18.920 --> 00:06:18.930
stuck initially but if I draw one of its
 

00:06:18.930 --> 00:06:20.930
stuck initially but if I draw one of its
two neighbors either one in this case

00:06:20.930 --> 00:06:20.940
two neighbors either one in this case
 

00:06:20.940 --> 00:06:23.690
two neighbors either one in this case
this card gets drawn out first it'll

00:06:23.690 --> 00:06:23.700
this card gets drawn out first it'll
 

00:06:23.700 --> 00:06:25.640
this card gets drawn out first it'll
flip over and I'll be able to draw it

00:06:25.640 --> 00:06:25.650
flip over and I'll be able to draw it
 

00:06:25.650 --> 00:06:28.010
flip over and I'll be able to draw it
out as long as I don't also draw out the

00:06:28.010 --> 00:06:28.020
out as long as I don't also draw out the
 

00:06:28.020 --> 00:06:29.960
out as long as I don't also draw out the
card to the other side of it so it has

00:06:29.960 --> 00:06:29.970
card to the other side of it so it has
 

00:06:29.970 --> 00:06:31.850
card to the other side of it so it has
to be before one of its neighbors and

00:06:31.850 --> 00:06:31.860
to be before one of its neighbors and
 

00:06:31.860 --> 00:06:34.640
to be before one of its neighbors and
after the other so face up cards are

00:06:34.640 --> 00:06:34.650
after the other so face up cards are
 

00:06:34.650 --> 00:06:36.590
after the other so face up cards are
either going to have to be less than

00:06:36.590 --> 00:06:36.600
either going to have to be less than
 

00:06:36.600 --> 00:06:39.470
either going to have to be less than
both of the neighbors or greater than

00:06:39.470 --> 00:06:39.480
both of the neighbors or greater than
 

00:06:39.480 --> 00:06:41.840
both of the neighbors or greater than
both of the neighbors so this one this

00:06:41.840 --> 00:06:41.850
both of the neighbors so this one this
 

00:06:41.850 --> 00:06:44.960
both of the neighbors so this one this
one is less than both this 4 is greater

00:06:44.960 --> 00:06:44.970
one is less than both this 4 is greater
 

00:06:44.970 --> 00:06:48.350
one is less than both this 4 is greater
than both now this 3 is face down 3 it

00:06:48.350 --> 00:06:48.360
than both now this 3 is face down 3 it
 

00:06:48.360 --> 00:06:51.530
than both now this 3 is face down 3 it
has to be greater than one neighbor and

00:06:51.530 --> 00:06:51.540
has to be greater than one neighbor and
 

00:06:51.540 --> 00:06:53.120
has to be greater than one neighbor and
less than the other so that's been

00:06:53.120 --> 00:06:53.130
less than the other so that's been
 

00:06:53.130 --> 00:06:54.770
less than the other so that's been
flipped over exactly once and we can

00:06:54.770 --> 00:06:54.780
flipped over exactly once and we can
 

00:06:54.780 --> 00:06:58.490
flipped over exactly once and we can
draw that 3 is greater than 2 at the end

00:06:58.490 --> 00:06:58.500
draw that 3 is greater than 2 at the end
 

00:06:58.500 --> 00:07:00.470
draw that 3 is greater than 2 at the end
here nothing to the right of that so

00:07:00.470 --> 00:07:00.480
here nothing to the right of that so
 

00:07:00.480 --> 00:07:02.360
here nothing to the right of that so
this card because it's face up but

00:07:02.360 --> 00:07:02.370
this card because it's face up but
 

00:07:02.370 --> 00:07:04.610
this card because it's face up but
absolutely has to be drawn up before its

00:07:04.610 --> 00:07:04.620
absolutely has to be drawn up before its
 

00:07:04.620 --> 00:07:06.290
absolutely has to be drawn up before its
neighbor if this car were drawn out

00:07:06.290 --> 00:07:06.300
neighbor if this car were drawn out
 

00:07:06.300 --> 00:07:08.270
neighbor if this car were drawn out
first this would be stuck forever long

00:07:08.270 --> 00:07:08.280
first this would be stuck forever long
 

00:07:08.280 --> 00:07:12.110
first this would be stuck forever long
dis son 10 is less than 11 which is less

00:07:12.110 --> 00:07:12.120
dis son 10 is less than 11 which is less
 

00:07:12.120 --> 00:07:14.450
dis son 10 is less than 11 which is less
than 12 which is less than 13 right here

00:07:14.450 --> 00:07:14.460
than 12 which is less than 13 right here
 

00:07:14.460 --> 00:07:18.050
than 12 which is less than 13 right here
in the centre 6 a is less than 7 just

00:07:18.050 --> 00:07:18.060
in the centre 6 a is less than 7 just
 

00:07:18.060 --> 00:07:20.510
in the centre 6 a is less than 7 just
less than 8 so I played a bunch of games

00:07:20.510 --> 00:07:20.520
less than 8 so I played a bunch of games
 

00:07:20.520 --> 00:07:22.220
less than 8 so I played a bunch of games
when I was trying to figure out how the

00:07:22.220 --> 00:07:22.230
when I was trying to figure out how the
 

00:07:22.230 --> 00:07:25.610
when I was trying to figure out how the
pair of us then I looked at this sort of

00:07:25.610 --> 00:07:25.620
pair of us then I looked at this sort of
 

00:07:25.620 --> 00:07:27.950
pair of us then I looked at this sort of
greater-than less-than sequence and it

00:07:27.950 --> 00:07:27.960
greater-than less-than sequence and it
 

00:07:27.960 --> 00:07:29.570
greater-than less-than sequence and it
started to look a lot like a jigsaw

00:07:29.570 --> 00:07:29.580
started to look a lot like a jigsaw
 

00:07:29.580 --> 00:07:31.790
started to look a lot like a jigsaw
puzzle to me and I realized that all the

00:07:31.790 --> 00:07:31.800
puzzle to me and I realized that all the
 

00:07:31.800 --> 00:07:34.070
puzzle to me and I realized that all the
face-up cards it looked like one of two

00:07:34.070 --> 00:07:34.080
face-up cards it looked like one of two
 

00:07:34.080 --> 00:07:36.830
face-up cards it looked like one of two
kinds of pieces they either looked like

00:07:36.830 --> 00:07:36.840
kinds of pieces they either looked like
 

00:07:36.840 --> 00:07:39.650
kinds of pieces they either looked like
these sort of diamond shades pieces or

00:07:39.650 --> 00:07:39.660
these sort of diamond shades pieces or
 

00:07:39.660 --> 00:07:42.380
these sort of diamond shades pieces or
they looked like these kind of concave

00:07:42.380 --> 00:07:42.390
they looked like these kind of concave
 

00:07:42.390 --> 00:07:43.520
they looked like these kind of concave
pieces

00:07:43.520 --> 00:07:43.530
pieces
 

00:07:43.530 --> 00:07:46.010
pieces
this one here in the center connecting

00:07:46.010 --> 00:07:46.020
this one here in the center connecting
 

00:07:46.020 --> 00:07:48.890
this one here in the center connecting
the nine and the four piece and then for

00:07:48.890 --> 00:07:48.900
the nine and the four piece and then for
 

00:07:48.900 --> 00:07:52.340
the nine and the four piece and then for
all of the facedown cards every single

00:07:52.340 --> 00:07:52.350
all of the facedown cards every single
 

00:07:52.350 --> 00:07:54.590
all of the facedown cards every single
piece looks exactly the same double to

00:07:54.590 --> 00:07:54.600
piece looks exactly the same double to
 

00:07:54.600 --> 00:07:57.470
piece looks exactly the same double to
the left or double to the right so so I

00:07:57.470 --> 00:07:57.480
the left or double to the right so so I
 

00:07:57.480 --> 00:08:01.070
the left or double to the right so so I
just made one kind for that and started

00:08:01.070 --> 00:08:01.080
just made one kind for that and started
 

00:08:01.080 --> 00:08:02.960
just made one kind for that and started
putting them in the either moving to the

00:08:02.960 --> 00:08:02.970
putting them in the either moving to the
 

00:08:02.970 --> 00:08:12.740
putting them in the either moving to the
right or to the left and then the two

00:08:12.740 --> 00:08:12.750
right or to the left and then the two
 

00:08:12.750 --> 00:08:15.440
right or to the left and then the two
ends are something special the two ends

00:08:15.440 --> 00:08:15.450
ends are something special the two ends
 

00:08:15.450 --> 00:08:18.500
ends are something special the two ends
are completely forced to based on if

00:08:18.500 --> 00:08:18.510
are completely forced to based on if
 

00:08:18.510 --> 00:08:21.020
are completely forced to based on if
it's face up or face down if it's face

00:08:21.020 --> 00:08:21.030
it's face up or face down if it's face
 

00:08:21.030 --> 00:08:23.740
it's face up or face down if it's face
down then it absolutely has to be drawn

00:08:23.740 --> 00:08:23.750
down then it absolutely has to be drawn
 

00:08:23.750 --> 00:08:26.690
down then it absolutely has to be drawn
after its neighbor because it's stuck to

00:08:26.690 --> 00:08:26.700
after its neighbor because it's stuck to
 

00:08:26.700 --> 00:08:29.900
after its neighbor because it's stuck to
begin with so greater then makes the

00:08:29.900 --> 00:08:29.910
begin with so greater then makes the
 

00:08:29.910 --> 00:08:32.149
begin with so greater then makes the
piece look like this on the other hand

00:08:32.149 --> 00:08:32.159
piece look like this on the other hand
 

00:08:32.159 --> 00:08:34.610
piece look like this on the other hand
if it's face up then it absolutely has

00:08:34.610 --> 00:08:34.620
if it's face up then it absolutely has
 

00:08:34.620 --> 00:08:36.860
if it's face up then it absolutely has
to be drawn before its neighbor if I

00:08:36.860 --> 00:08:36.870
to be drawn before its neighbor if I
 

00:08:36.870 --> 00:08:39.890
to be drawn before its neighbor if I
drew out this card first this one we get

00:08:39.890 --> 00:08:39.900
drew out this card first this one we get
 

00:08:39.900 --> 00:08:43.240
drew out this card first this one we get
stuck so I better had gone that out

00:08:43.240 --> 00:08:43.250
stuck so I better had gone that out
 

00:08:43.250 --> 00:08:46.460
stuck so I better had gone that out
before the card next to it so I created

00:08:46.460 --> 00:08:46.470
before the card next to it so I created
 

00:08:46.470 --> 00:08:48.770
before the card next to it so I created
these two pieces for the possibilities

00:08:48.770 --> 00:08:48.780
these two pieces for the possibilities
 

00:08:48.780 --> 00:08:56.360
these two pieces for the possibilities
of the ends

00:08:56.360 --> 00:08:56.370
 
 

00:08:56.370 --> 00:08:59.329
 
all right so again we've drawn that one

00:08:59.329 --> 00:08:59.339
all right so again we've drawn that one
 

00:08:59.339 --> 00:09:01.550
all right so again we've drawn that one
that has five face up cards so this is

00:09:01.550 --> 00:09:01.560
that has five face up cards so this is
 

00:09:01.560 --> 00:09:03.980
that has five face up cards so this is
going to be solvable but have no clue

00:09:03.980 --> 00:09:03.990
going to be solvable but have no clue
 

00:09:03.990 --> 00:09:05.450
going to be solvable but have no clue
what were there will work and I'll show

00:09:05.450 --> 00:09:05.460
what were there will work and I'll show
 

00:09:05.460 --> 00:09:07.550
what were there will work and I'll show
you how to use the pieces to both see

00:09:07.550 --> 00:09:07.560
you how to use the pieces to both see
 

00:09:07.560 --> 00:09:09.470
you how to use the pieces to both see
that it's solvable and see what wearing

00:09:09.470 --> 00:09:09.480
that it's solvable and see what wearing
 

00:09:09.480 --> 00:09:12.019
that it's solvable and see what wearing
will work so starting from the left

00:09:12.019 --> 00:09:12.029
will work so starting from the left
 

00:09:12.029 --> 00:09:15.530
will work so starting from the left
because this card is face up it has to

00:09:15.530 --> 00:09:15.540
because this card is face up it has to
 

00:09:15.540 --> 00:09:18.170
because this card is face up it has to
be drawn out earlier so with an order

00:09:18.170 --> 00:09:18.180
be drawn out earlier so with an order
 

00:09:18.180 --> 00:09:21.500
be drawn out earlier so with an order
that's a less than its neighbor in this

00:09:21.500 --> 00:09:21.510
that's a less than its neighbor in this
 

00:09:21.510 --> 00:09:23.720
that's a less than its neighbor in this
card being face up means that I have a

00:09:23.720 --> 00:09:23.730
card being face up means that I have a
 

00:09:23.730 --> 00:09:27.019
card being face up means that I have a
choice either after both of its

00:09:27.019 --> 00:09:27.029
choice either after both of its
 

00:09:27.029 --> 00:09:30.290
choice either after both of its
neighbors or before so this is after or

00:09:30.290 --> 00:09:30.300
neighbors or before so this is after or
 

00:09:30.300 --> 00:09:33.380
neighbors or before so this is after or
there is a number on this card that's

00:09:33.380 --> 00:09:33.390
there is a number on this card that's
 

00:09:33.390 --> 00:09:35.390
there is a number on this card that's
greater than both of its neighbors and

00:09:35.390 --> 00:09:35.400
greater than both of its neighbors and
 

00:09:35.400 --> 00:09:36.920
greater than both of its neighbors and
this one would be before both of its

00:09:36.920 --> 00:09:36.930
this one would be before both of its
 

00:09:36.930 --> 00:09:39.740
this one would be before both of its
neighbors and well I'm choosing between

00:09:39.740 --> 00:09:39.750
neighbors and well I'm choosing between
 

00:09:39.750 --> 00:09:43.280
neighbors and well I'm choosing between
these but only one of them agree is with

00:09:43.280 --> 00:09:43.290
these but only one of them agree is with
 

00:09:43.290 --> 00:09:45.200
these but only one of them agree is with
the card to the left of it so the choice

00:09:45.200 --> 00:09:45.210
the card to the left of it so the choice
 

00:09:45.210 --> 00:09:47.000
the card to the left of it so the choice
is actually completely forced I have to

00:09:47.000 --> 00:09:47.010
is actually completely forced I have to
 

00:09:47.010 --> 00:09:50.900
is actually completely forced I have to
put down this one so then moving on this

00:09:50.900 --> 00:09:50.910
put down this one so then moving on this
 

00:09:50.910 --> 00:09:53.110
put down this one so then moving on this
one's face down that means it has to be

00:09:53.110 --> 00:09:53.120
one's face down that means it has to be
 

00:09:53.120 --> 00:09:55.340
one's face down that means it has to be
earlier than one neighbor and less than

00:09:55.340 --> 00:09:55.350
earlier than one neighbor and less than
 

00:09:55.350 --> 00:09:57.079
earlier than one neighbor and less than
the other but we already know that it's

00:09:57.079 --> 00:09:57.089
the other but we already know that it's
 

00:09:57.089 --> 00:09:58.490
the other but we already know that it's
going to be earlier than this one which

00:09:58.490 --> 00:09:58.500
going to be earlier than this one which
 

00:09:58.500 --> 00:10:01.730
going to be earlier than this one which
means it has to be earlier and then less

00:10:01.730 --> 00:10:01.740
means it has to be earlier and then less
 

00:10:01.740 --> 00:10:03.620
means it has to be earlier and then less
than its right neighbor I'm just going

00:10:03.620 --> 00:10:03.630
than its right neighbor I'm just going
 

00:10:03.630 --> 00:10:05.780
than its right neighbor I'm just going
to keep going down and for every

00:10:05.780 --> 00:10:05.790
to keep going down and for every
 

00:10:05.790 --> 00:10:08.900
to keep going down and for every
facedown card this is the shape that has

00:10:08.900 --> 00:10:08.910
facedown card this is the shape that has
 

00:10:08.910 --> 00:10:10.190
facedown card this is the shape that has
to be it's either going to be to the

00:10:10.190 --> 00:10:10.200
to be it's either going to be to the
 

00:10:10.200 --> 00:10:11.900
to be it's either going to be to the
left or to the right but it's always

00:10:11.900 --> 00:10:11.910
left or to the right but it's always
 

00:10:11.910 --> 00:10:13.370
left or to the right but it's always
going to be forced by what came before

00:10:13.370 --> 00:10:13.380
going to be forced by what came before
 

00:10:13.380 --> 00:10:16.340
going to be forced by what came before
it for face-up cards I have to put down

00:10:16.340 --> 00:10:16.350
it for face-up cards I have to put down
 

00:10:16.350 --> 00:10:18.680
it for face-up cards I have to put down
that the one that fits next to it's a

00:10:18.680 --> 00:10:18.690
that the one that fits next to it's a
 

00:10:18.690 --> 00:10:24.970
that the one that fits next to it's a
blue piece just laid so let's fill it up

00:10:24.970 --> 00:10:24.980
 
 

00:10:24.980 --> 00:10:27.740
 
now it's the moment of truth we've got

00:10:27.740 --> 00:10:27.750
now it's the moment of truth we've got
 

00:10:27.750 --> 00:10:30.650
now it's the moment of truth we've got
one card at the end and two possible

00:10:30.650 --> 00:10:30.660
one card at the end and two possible
 

00:10:30.660 --> 00:10:33.769
one card at the end and two possible
pieces for this facedown card though it

00:10:33.769 --> 00:10:33.779
pieces for this facedown card though it
 

00:10:33.779 --> 00:10:36.410
pieces for this facedown card though it
has to be drawn out after its neighbor

00:10:36.410 --> 00:10:36.420
has to be drawn out after its neighbor
 

00:10:36.420 --> 00:10:40.280
has to be drawn out after its neighbor
no choice there so we'd better hope that

00:10:40.280 --> 00:10:40.290
no choice there so we'd better hope that
 

00:10:40.290 --> 00:10:42.160
no choice there so we'd better hope that
it's number that the number of its order

00:10:42.160 --> 00:10:42.170
it's number that the number of its order
 

00:10:42.170 --> 00:10:45.760
it's number that the number of its order
we'd better hope that the order is

00:10:45.760 --> 00:10:45.770
we'd better hope that the order is
 

00:10:45.770 --> 00:10:49.040
we'd better hope that the order is
larger than the card next to it in this

00:10:49.040 --> 00:10:49.050
larger than the card next to it in this
 

00:10:49.050 --> 00:10:51.400
larger than the card next to it in this
case it can be this sign right here

00:10:51.400 --> 00:10:51.410
case it can be this sign right here
 

00:10:51.410 --> 00:10:54.500
case it can be this sign right here
saying that this number can be larger

00:10:54.500 --> 00:10:54.510
saying that this number can be larger
 

00:10:54.510 --> 00:10:57.290
saying that this number can be larger
than this number therefore this is the

00:10:57.290 --> 00:10:57.300
than this number therefore this is the
 

00:10:57.300 --> 00:10:59.720
than this number therefore this is the
piece that fits that's good the green

00:10:59.720 --> 00:10:59.730
piece that fits that's good the green
 

00:10:59.730 --> 00:11:01.790
piece that fits that's good the green
pieces are the ones that go with a

00:11:01.790 --> 00:11:01.800
pieces are the ones that go with a
 

00:11:01.800 --> 00:11:04.550
pieces are the ones that go with a
facedown card on the edge so it except

00:11:04.550 --> 00:11:04.560
facedown card on the edge so it except
 

00:11:04.560 --> 00:11:06.260
facedown card on the edge so it except
when luckily luckily it accepts that

00:11:06.260 --> 00:11:06.270
when luckily luckily it accepts that
 

00:11:06.270 --> 00:11:08.780
when luckily luckily it accepts that
it's receiving it exactly and if it had

00:11:08.780 --> 00:11:08.790
it's receiving it exactly and if it had
 

00:11:08.790 --> 00:11:09.440
it's receiving it exactly and if it had
happened

00:11:09.440 --> 00:11:09.450
happened
 

00:11:09.450 --> 00:11:12.320
happened
to be a faceoff card here on the edge

00:11:12.320 --> 00:11:12.330
to be a faceoff card here on the edge
 

00:11:12.330 --> 00:11:14.720
to be a faceoff card here on the edge
meaning that there are six total face-up

00:11:14.720 --> 00:11:14.730
meaning that there are six total face-up
 

00:11:14.730 --> 00:11:17.840
meaning that there are six total face-up
cards a this wouldn't have worked this

00:11:17.840 --> 00:11:17.850
cards a this wouldn't have worked this
 

00:11:17.850 --> 00:11:20.570
cards a this wouldn't have worked this
would have had to be drawn out before

00:11:20.570 --> 00:11:20.580
would have had to be drawn out before
 

00:11:20.580 --> 00:11:21.770
would have had to be drawn out before
its neighbor it would have been stuck

00:11:21.770 --> 00:11:21.780
its neighbor it would have been stuck
 

00:11:21.780 --> 00:11:23.750
its neighbor it would have been stuck
there forever meaning that it would need

00:11:23.750 --> 00:11:23.760
there forever meaning that it would need
 

00:11:23.760 --> 00:11:25.580
there forever meaning that it would need
this piece under it but this piece

00:11:25.580 --> 00:11:25.590
this piece under it but this piece
 

00:11:25.590 --> 00:11:29.300
this piece under it but this piece
doesn't fit so I'm very happy that we've

00:11:29.300 --> 00:11:29.310
doesn't fit so I'm very happy that we've
 

00:11:29.310 --> 00:11:34.250
doesn't fit so I'm very happy that we've
got facedown card on the edge we

00:11:34.250 --> 00:11:34.260
got facedown card on the edge we
 

00:11:34.260 --> 00:11:36.860
got facedown card on the edge we
actually can actually use this to see

00:11:36.860 --> 00:11:36.870
actually can actually use this to see
 

00:11:36.870 --> 00:11:39.350
actually can actually use this to see
how to win the game in particular we can

00:11:39.350 --> 00:11:39.360
how to win the game in particular we can
 

00:11:39.360 --> 00:11:40.790
how to win the game in particular we can
see that the cards that need to be drawn

00:11:40.790 --> 00:11:40.800
see that the cards that need to be drawn
 

00:11:40.800 --> 00:11:42.500
see that the cards that need to be drawn
out early are the cards that have the

00:11:42.500 --> 00:11:42.510
out early are the cards that have the
 

00:11:42.510 --> 00:11:44.750
out early are the cards that have the
smallest values theirs are going to be

00:11:44.750 --> 00:11:44.760
smallest values theirs are going to be
 

00:11:44.760 --> 00:11:47.000
smallest values theirs are going to be
the yellow cards you can draw those out

00:11:47.000 --> 00:11:47.010
the yellow cards you can draw those out
 

00:11:47.010 --> 00:11:49.430
the yellow cards you can draw those out
in either order you can do this whole

00:11:49.430 --> 00:11:49.440
in either order you can do this whole
 

00:11:49.440 --> 00:11:51.170
in either order you can do this whole
side of the game before this side of the

00:11:51.170 --> 00:11:51.180
side of the game before this side of the
 

00:11:51.180 --> 00:11:53.690
side of the game before this side of the
game but this card has to be drawn out

game but this card has to be drawn out
 

00:11:53.700 --> 00:11:56.120
game but this card has to be drawn out
before both of its neighbors in fact

00:11:56.120 --> 00:11:56.130
before both of its neighbors in fact
 

00:11:56.130 --> 00:11:58.700
before both of its neighbors in fact
that any sequence of removing that the

hedgehog oh what's his name you want me
 

00:12:23.670 --> 00:12:29.330
hedgehog oh what's his name you want me
to name him Calvin the Hedgehog Calvin

00:12:29.330 --> 00:12:29.340
to name him Calvin the Hedgehog Calvin
 

00:12:29.340 --> 00:12:32.270
to name him Calvin the Hedgehog Calvin
the Hedgehog is a bit fussy in

00:12:32.270 --> 00:12:32.280
the Hedgehog is a bit fussy in
 

00:12:32.280 --> 00:12:34.940
the Hedgehog is a bit fussy in
particular he likes to go on walks oh

00:12:34.940 --> 00:12:34.950
particular he likes to go on walks oh
 

00:12:34.950 --> 00:12:38.300
particular he likes to go on walks oh
but whenever he reaches an arrow he has

00:12:38.300 --> 00:12:38.310
but whenever he reaches an arrow he has
 

00:12:38.310 --> 00:12:39.560
but whenever he reaches an arrow he has
to go over it in the way that's aligned

00:12:39.560 --> 00:12:39.570
to go over it in the way that's aligned
 

00:12:39.570 --> 00:12:41.420
to go over it in the way that's aligned
with his nose so if he's reaching an

00:12:41.420 --> 00:12:41.430
with his nose so if he's reaching an
 

00:12:41.430 --> 00:12:43.370
with his nose so if he's reaching an
arrow that points to the left he

00:12:43.370 --> 00:12:43.380
arrow that points to the left he
 

00:12:43.380 --> 00:12:45.800
arrow that points to the left he
actually is going to turn around and

00:12:45.800 --> 00:12:45.810
actually is going to turn around and
 

00:12:45.810 --> 00:12:48.050
actually is going to turn around and
start going backwards until he reaches

00:12:48.050 --> 00:12:48.060
start going backwards until he reaches
 

00:12:48.060 --> 00:12:50.240
start going backwards until he reaches
an arrow that faces to the right again

00:12:50.240 --> 00:12:50.250
an arrow that faces to the right again
 

00:12:50.250 --> 00:12:53.570
an arrow that faces to the right again
he's gonna swish it and keep going he

00:12:53.570 --> 00:12:53.580
he's gonna swish it and keep going he
 

00:12:53.580 --> 00:12:55.370
he's gonna swish it and keep going he
can get to the end both him first he

00:12:55.370 --> 00:12:55.380
can get to the end both him first he
 

00:12:55.380 --> 00:12:57.710
can get to the end both him first he
just has to get yes he can get to the

00:12:57.710 --> 00:12:57.720
just has to get yes he can get to the
 

00:12:57.720 --> 00:13:02.270
just has to get yes he can get to the
end but first bottom bottom he can get

00:13:02.270 --> 00:13:02.280
end but first bottom bottom he can get
 

00:13:02.280 --> 00:13:05.030
end but first bottom bottom he can get
to the end bottom first but he has to

00:13:05.030 --> 00:13:05.040
to the end bottom first but he has to
 

00:13:05.040 --> 00:13:06.830
to the end bottom first but he has to
reach all the way from the left side

00:13:06.830 --> 00:13:06.840
reach all the way from the left side
 

00:13:06.840 --> 00:13:09.250
reach all the way from the left side
that's the right side and he is

00:13:09.250 --> 00:13:09.260
that's the right side and he is
 

00:13:09.260 --> 00:13:11.810
that's the right side and he is
incredibly fussy so if he ever has to

00:13:11.810 --> 00:13:11.820
incredibly fussy so if he ever has to
 

00:13:11.820 --> 00:13:12.950
incredibly fussy so if he ever has to
break the rules he's not willing to

00:13:12.950 --> 00:13:12.960
break the rules he's not willing to
 

00:13:12.960 --> 00:13:17.060
break the rules he's not willing to
proceed so you asked me why an even

00:13:17.060 --> 00:13:17.070
proceed so you asked me why an even
 

00:13:17.070 --> 00:13:18.800
proceed so you asked me why an even
number of face-up cards wouldn't work

00:13:18.800 --> 00:13:18.810
number of face-up cards wouldn't work
 

00:13:18.810 --> 00:13:21.770
number of face-up cards wouldn't work
and the answer is if you imagine Calvin

00:13:21.770 --> 00:13:21.780
and the answer is if you imagine Calvin
 

00:13:21.780 --> 00:13:23.240
and the answer is if you imagine Calvin
starting at the begin

00:13:23.240 --> 00:13:23.250
starting at the begin
 

00:13:23.250 --> 00:13:26.119
starting at the begin
going over the cards every time there's

00:13:26.119 --> 00:13:26.129
going over the cards every time there's
 

00:13:26.129 --> 00:13:27.949
going over the cards every time there's
a face-up card including at the very

00:13:27.949 --> 00:13:27.959
a face-up card including at the very
 

00:13:27.959 --> 00:13:36.510
a face-up card including at the very
beginning it causes Calvin to turn

00:13:36.510 --> 00:13:36.520
 
 

00:13:36.520 --> 00:13:39.520
 
[Music]

00:13:39.520 --> 00:13:39.530
[Music]
 

00:13:39.530 --> 00:13:42.490
[Music]
now at the end here we can actually

00:13:42.490 --> 00:13:42.500
now at the end here we can actually
 

00:13:42.500 --> 00:13:45.160
now at the end here we can actually
figure out which direction he's facing

00:13:45.160 --> 00:13:45.170
figure out which direction he's facing
 

00:13:45.170 --> 00:13:48.190
figure out which direction he's facing
just by looking at how many face-up

00:13:48.190 --> 00:13:48.200
just by looking at how many face-up
 

00:13:48.200 --> 00:13:49.540
just by looking at how many face-up
cards there were because those are the

00:13:49.540 --> 00:13:49.550
cards there were because those are the
 

00:13:49.550 --> 00:13:51.820
cards there were because those are the
only points when he turned and if he's

00:13:51.820 --> 00:13:51.830
only points when he turned and if he's
 

00:13:51.830 --> 00:13:55.090
only points when he turned and if he's
turned around a even number of times so

00:13:55.090 --> 00:13:55.100
turned around a even number of times so
 

00:13:55.100 --> 00:13:57.040
turned around a even number of times so
if he starts off going ahead and then

00:13:57.040 --> 00:13:57.050
if he starts off going ahead and then
 

00:13:57.050 --> 00:13:58.960
if he starts off going ahead and then
turns one two

00:13:58.960 --> 00:13:58.970
turns one two
 

00:13:58.970 --> 00:14:01.450
turns one two
he's back to forward three four back to

00:14:01.450 --> 00:14:01.460
he's back to forward three four back to
 

00:14:01.460 --> 00:14:03.460
he's back to forward three four back to
forward if he turns an even number of

00:14:03.460 --> 00:14:03.470
forward if he turns an even number of
 

00:14:03.470 --> 00:14:05.290
forward if he turns an even number of
times if they're an even number face-up

00:14:05.290 --> 00:14:05.300
times if they're an even number face-up
 

00:14:05.300 --> 00:14:06.880
times if they're an even number face-up
cards and he's going to be going the

00:14:06.880 --> 00:14:06.890
cards and he's going to be going the
 

00:14:06.890 --> 00:14:08.650
cards and he's going to be going the
same direction as he started if he

00:14:08.650 --> 00:14:08.660
same direction as he started if he
 

00:14:08.660 --> 00:14:10.600
same direction as he started if he
starts on the picture card then he has

00:14:10.600 --> 00:14:10.610
starts on the picture card then he has
 

00:14:10.610 --> 00:14:12.370
starts on the picture card then he has
to start off pointing to the left so

00:14:12.370 --> 00:14:12.380
to start off pointing to the left so
 

00:14:12.380 --> 00:14:15.580
to start off pointing to the left so
walking but first and then every time he

00:14:15.580 --> 00:14:15.590
walking but first and then every time he
 

00:14:15.590 --> 00:14:18.010
walking but first and then every time he
reaches a face-up card he'll turn around

00:14:18.010 --> 00:14:18.020
reaches a face-up card he'll turn around
 

00:14:18.020 --> 00:14:20.650
reaches a face-up card he'll turn around
this means that if there are an even

00:14:20.650 --> 00:14:20.660
this means that if there are an even
 

00:14:20.660 --> 00:14:22.990
this means that if there are an even
number of face-up cards after this first

00:14:22.990 --> 00:14:23.000
number of face-up cards after this first
 

00:14:23.000 --> 00:14:25.170
number of face-up cards after this first
one which means an odd number total

00:14:25.170 --> 00:14:25.180
one which means an odd number total
 

00:14:25.180 --> 00:14:28.570
one which means an odd number total
he'll wind up facing backwards at the

00:14:28.570 --> 00:14:28.580
he'll wind up facing backwards at the
 

00:14:28.580 --> 00:14:31.180
he'll wind up facing backwards at the
very end and if he's facing backwards at

00:14:31.180 --> 00:14:31.190
very end and if he's facing backwards at
 

00:14:31.190 --> 00:14:33.510
very end and if he's facing backwards at
the very end then the last car that

00:14:33.510 --> 00:14:33.520
the very end then the last car that
 

00:14:33.520 --> 00:14:36.730
the very end then the last car that
absolutely has to be one that fits in

00:14:36.730 --> 00:14:36.740
absolutely has to be one that fits in
 

00:14:36.740 --> 00:14:38.920
absolutely has to be one that fits in
with this arrow an arrow pointing left I

00:14:38.920 --> 00:14:38.930
with this arrow an arrow pointing left I
 

00:14:38.930 --> 00:14:40.450
with this arrow an arrow pointing left I
mean that absolutely has to be a

00:14:40.450 --> 00:14:40.460
mean that absolutely has to be a
 

00:14:40.460 --> 00:14:43.510
mean that absolutely has to be a
facedown card so in total you'll have an

00:14:43.510 --> 00:14:43.520
facedown card so in total you'll have an
 

00:14:43.520 --> 00:14:46.750
facedown card so in total you'll have an
odd number of face-up cards if at the

00:14:46.750 --> 00:14:46.760
odd number of face-up cards if at the
 

00:14:46.760 --> 00:14:49.510
odd number of face-up cards if at the
beginning your first card is face down

00:14:49.510 --> 00:14:49.520
beginning your first card is face down
 

00:14:49.520 --> 00:14:51.670
beginning your first card is face down
well that changes the entire puzzle

00:14:51.670 --> 00:14:51.680
well that changes the entire puzzle
 

00:14:51.680 --> 00:14:54.730
well that changes the entire puzzle
sequence all the way across and you'll

00:14:54.730 --> 00:14:54.740
sequence all the way across and you'll
 

00:14:54.740 --> 00:14:56.530
sequence all the way across and you'll
have a Hedgehog that gets to start going

00:14:56.530 --> 00:14:56.540
have a Hedgehog that gets to start going
 

00:14:56.540 --> 00:15:00.070
have a Hedgehog that gets to start going
forward and then if it passes over an

00:15:00.070 --> 00:15:00.080
forward and then if it passes over an
 

00:15:00.080 --> 00:15:02.650
forward and then if it passes over an
odd number face-up cards it will have

00:15:02.650 --> 00:15:02.660
odd number face-up cards it will have
 

00:15:02.660 --> 00:15:04.630
odd number face-up cards it will have
turned around backwards if it passes

00:15:04.630 --> 00:15:04.640
turned around backwards if it passes
 

00:15:04.640 --> 00:15:07.270
turned around backwards if it passes
over an even number of face-up cards it

00:15:07.270 --> 00:15:07.280
over an even number of face-up cards it
 

00:15:07.280 --> 00:15:08.829
over an even number of face-up cards it
will have turned around so that it's a

00:15:08.829 --> 00:15:08.839
will have turned around so that it's a
 

00:15:08.839 --> 00:15:10.270
will have turned around so that it's a
you know backwards forwards backwards

00:15:10.270 --> 00:15:10.280
you know backwards forwards backwards
 

00:15:10.280 --> 00:15:11.650
you know backwards forwards backwards
turns around until it's facing

00:15:11.650 --> 00:15:11.660
turns around until it's facing
 

00:15:11.660 --> 00:15:14.740
turns around until it's facing
ultimately forwards again so replacing

00:15:14.740 --> 00:15:14.750
ultimately forwards again so replacing
 

00:15:14.750 --> 00:15:18.070
ultimately forwards again so replacing
this card here with a reverse every

00:15:18.070 --> 00:15:18.080
this card here with a reverse every
 

00:15:18.080 --> 00:15:20.800
this card here with a reverse every
single piece in the row every red block

00:15:20.800 --> 00:15:20.810
single piece in the row every red block
 

00:15:20.810 --> 00:15:22.750
single piece in the row every red block
would become yellow and every blue block

00:15:22.750 --> 00:15:22.760
would become yellow and every blue block
 

00:15:22.760 --> 00:15:24.790
would become yellow and every blue block
would have to change directions and by

00:15:24.790 --> 00:15:24.800
would have to change directions and by
 

00:15:24.800 --> 00:15:26.710
would have to change directions and by
the time you get to the end you'd need

00:15:26.710 --> 00:15:26.720
the time you get to the end you'd need
 

00:15:26.720 --> 00:15:28.870
the time you get to the end you'd need
the opposite kind of card in order to

00:15:28.870 --> 00:15:28.880
the opposite kind of card in order to
 

00:15:28.880 --> 00:15:31.660
the opposite kind of card in order to
complete it so ultimately if this one

00:15:31.660 --> 00:15:31.670
complete it so ultimately if this one
 

00:15:31.670 --> 00:15:34.540
complete it so ultimately if this one
winds up face-up and has to be down this

00:15:34.540 --> 00:15:34.550
winds up face-up and has to be down this
 

00:15:34.550 --> 00:15:37.660
winds up face-up and has to be down this
one down ends up and that's based on the

00:15:37.660 --> 00:15:37.670
one down ends up and that's based on the
 

00:15:37.670 --> 00:15:39.730
one down ends up and that's based on the
number in the middle if the number in

00:15:39.730 --> 00:15:39.740
number in the middle if the number in
 

00:15:39.740 --> 00:15:42.160
number in the middle if the number in
the middle is odd then the ends have to

00:15:42.160 --> 00:15:42.170
the middle is odd then the ends have to
 

00:15:42.170 --> 00:15:44.350
the middle is odd then the ends have to
match if the number in the middle is

00:15:44.350 --> 00:15:44.360
match if the number in the middle is
 

00:15:44.360 --> 00:15:46.270
match if the number in the middle is
even then the ends have to be different

00:15:46.270 --> 00:15:46.280
even then the ends have to be different
 

00:15:46.280 --> 00:15:48.010
even then the ends have to be different
do you ever play this game anymore or

00:15:48.010 --> 00:15:48.020
do you ever play this game anymore or
 

00:15:48.020 --> 00:15:49.329
do you ever play this game anymore or
was playing this game boring because you

00:15:49.329 --> 00:15:49.339
was playing this game boring because you
 

00:15:49.339 --> 00:15:50.470
was playing this game boring because you
because you always know that was over

00:15:50.470 --> 00:15:50.480
because you always know that was over
 

00:15:50.480 --> 00:15:52.540
because you always know that was over
now I like to play this game with people

00:15:52.540 --> 00:15:52.550
now I like to play this game with people
 

00:15:52.550 --> 00:15:53.300
now I like to play this game with people
who have never played

00:15:53.300 --> 00:15:53.310
who have never played
 

00:15:53.310 --> 00:15:54.889
who have never played
before because if you give them a long

00:15:54.889 --> 00:15:54.899
before because if you give them a long
 

00:15:54.899 --> 00:15:57.530
before because if you give them a long
sequence of cards even though it might

00:15:57.530 --> 00:15:57.540
sequence of cards even though it might
 

00:15:57.540 --> 00:15:59.329
sequence of cards even though it might
be possible to win it you might know how

00:15:59.329 --> 00:15:59.339
be possible to win it you might know how
 

00:15:59.339 --> 00:16:00.980
be possible to win it you might know how
if they're an odd number of face-up

00:16:00.980 --> 00:16:00.990
if they're an odd number of face-up
 

00:16:00.990 --> 00:16:03.079
if they're an odd number of face-up
cards in the middle if they pick the

00:16:03.079 --> 00:16:03.089
cards in the middle if they pick the
 

00:16:03.089 --> 00:16:05.660
cards in the middle if they pick the
wrong ones and the wrong order then they

00:16:05.660 --> 00:16:05.670
wrong ones and the wrong order then they
 

00:16:05.670 --> 00:16:08.239
wrong ones and the wrong order then they
can still lose the game mm-hmm so

00:16:08.239 --> 00:16:08.249
can still lose the game mm-hmm so
 

00:16:08.249 --> 00:16:10.069
can still lose the game mm-hmm so
they're still you know some strategy

00:16:10.069 --> 00:16:10.079
they're still you know some strategy
 

00:16:10.079 --> 00:16:11.780
they're still you know some strategy
involved and that moment where you

00:16:11.780 --> 00:16:11.790
involved and that moment where you
 

00:16:11.790 --> 00:16:13.639
involved and that moment where you
realize oh they just flipped over that

00:16:13.639 --> 00:16:13.649
realize oh they just flipped over that
 

00:16:13.649 --> 00:16:15.170
realize oh they just flipped over that
card and I know they're doomed they

00:16:15.170 --> 00:16:15.180
card and I know they're doomed they
 

00:16:15.180 --> 00:16:16.460
card and I know they're doomed they
don't see it yet but I know they're

00:16:16.460 --> 00:16:16.470
don't see it yet but I know they're
 

00:16:16.470 --> 00:16:19.929
don't see it yet but I know they're
doomed and I guess I like that moment

00:16:19.929 --> 00:16:19.939
doomed and I guess I like that moment
 

00:16:19.939 --> 00:16:22.160
doomed and I guess I like that moment
all right I'm going to ask you to pick a

00:16:22.160 --> 00:16:22.170
all right I'm going to ask you to pick a
 

00:16:22.170 --> 00:16:25.040
all right I'm going to ask you to pick a
number between 10 and 20 and you're

00:16:25.040 --> 00:16:25.050
number between 10 and 20 and you're
 

00:16:25.050 --> 00:16:29.030
number between 10 and 20 and you're
going to say 13 all right now let's try

00:16:29.030 --> 00:16:29.040
going to say 13 all right now let's try
 

00:16:29.040 --> 00:16:31.579
going to say 13 all right now let's try
playing a longer game pick a number

00:16:31.579 --> 00:16:31.589
playing a longer game pick a number
 

00:16:31.589 --> 00:16:33.470
playing a longer game pick a number
between 10 and 20 this time

00:16:33.470 --> 00:16:33.480
between 10 and 20 this time
 

00:16:33.480 --> 00:16:35.100
between 10 and 20 this time
14

00:16:35.100 --> 00:16:35.110
14
 

00:16:35.110 --> 00:16:48.649
14
