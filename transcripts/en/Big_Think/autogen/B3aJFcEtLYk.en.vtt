central concern didn't get as much
 

00:01:50.710 --> 00:01:52.800
central concern didn't get as much
attention as I'd hoped and so I guess I

attention as I'd hoped and so I guess I
 

00:01:52.810 --> 00:01:55.770

and I've got young kids and III think of
 

00:03:17.560 --> 00:03:20.039
and I've got young kids and III think of
it in those terms people really ought to

00:03:20.039 --> 00:03:20.049
it in those terms people really ought to
 

00:03:20.049 --> 00:03:23.340
it in those terms people really ought to
think about it in that context the the

00:03:23.340 --> 00:03:23.350
think about it in that context the the
 

00:03:23.350 --> 00:03:24.810
think about it in that context the the

choose you become a prominent widely

00:03:30.870 --> 00:03:30.880
choose you become a prominent widely
 

00:03:30.880 --> 00:03:33.420
choose you become a prominent widely
publicized athlete you become a role

00:03:33.420 --> 00:03:33.430

they do they follow this very closely
that's the part of it that

00:03:43.580 --> 00:03:43.590
that's the part of it that
 

00:03:43.590 --> 00:03:50.160
that's the part of it that
I think deserves more attention

00:03:50.160 --> 00:03:50.170
 

00:03:50.170 --> 00:03:53.220
well I think that's that's a tenuous and

00:03:53.220 --> 00:03:53.230
well I think that's that's a tenuous and
 

00:03:53.230 --> 00:03:57.060
well I think that's that's a tenuous and

between $100,000 a year job and a
 

00:04:13.780 --> 00:04:15.780
between $100,000 a year job and a
$200,000 a year job it's a choice

00:04:15.780 --> 00:04:15.790
$200,000 a year job it's a choice
 

00:04:15.790 --> 00:04:18.780
$200,000 a year job it's a choice
between possibly unemployment very

00:04:18.780 --> 00:04:18.790
between possibly unemployment very
 

00:04:18.790 --> 00:04:21.509
between possibly unemployment very
difficult circumstances and five or ten

00:04:21.509 --> 00:04:21.519
difficult circumstances and five or ten
 

00:04:21.519 --> 00:04:24.180
difficult circumstances and five or ten
million dollars here and so obviously

00:04:24.180 --> 00:04:24.190
million dollars here and so obviously
 

00:04:24.190 --> 00:04:25.500

that's a factor I mean it affects

00:04:25.500 --> 00:04:25.510
that's a factor I mean it affects
 

00:04:25.510 --> 00:04:27.510
that's a factor I mean it affects
everybody else in life why should it not

00:04:27.510 --> 00:04:27.520
everybody else in life why should it not
 

00:04:27.520 --> 00:04:29.490
everybody else in life why should it not
affect athletes I mean you see again I

00:04:29.490 --> 00:04:29.500
affect athletes I mean you see again I
 

00:04:29.500 --> 00:04:31.980
affect athletes I mean you see again I
think it's a mistake to single out
