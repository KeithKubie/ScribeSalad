00:00:00.250 --> 00:00:02.607
- What we have here is a zoom-in

00:00:02.607 --> 00:00:04.820
of the surface of water.

00:00:04.820 --> 00:00:08.120
So up here you have the
air, this is the air,

00:00:08.120 --> 00:00:09.350
these are some air molecules,

00:00:09.350 --> 00:00:10.790
maybe they're nitrogen molecules.

00:00:10.790 --> 00:00:12.310
They're fairly far apart,
in fact, in reality,

00:00:12.310 --> 00:00:14.720
they would be even more
far apart than this.

00:00:14.720 --> 00:00:16.920
And then over here you
have water molecules.

00:00:16.920 --> 00:00:18.050
We've seen this many times.

00:00:18.050 --> 00:00:20.250
You have the oxygen atom and it's bonded

00:00:20.250 --> 00:00:22.950
to two hydrogen atoms, and the oxygen atom

00:00:22.950 --> 00:00:24.510
likes to hog the electrons more.

00:00:24.510 --> 00:00:25.820
It's more electronegative, so you have

00:00:25.820 --> 00:00:27.650
a partially negative charge at this end

00:00:27.650 --> 00:00:29.590
and partially positive ends at this end.

00:00:29.590 --> 00:00:31.050
And that attraction between the

00:00:31.050 --> 00:00:33.420
partially positive ends and
the partially negative ends,

00:00:33.420 --> 00:00:36.490
that's what gives water all
sorts of neat properties.

00:00:36.490 --> 00:00:38.490
Those are the hydrogen bonds.

00:00:38.490 --> 00:00:41.090
Those are the hydrogen
bonds that give water

00:00:41.090 --> 00:00:43.720
all sorts of neat properties and keep it

00:00:43.720 --> 00:00:45.550
in its liquid state at a standard

00:00:45.550 --> 00:00:47.550
temperature and pressure.

00:00:47.550 --> 00:00:48.723
Now what I want to think about

00:00:48.723 --> 00:00:51.090
is the surface in particular.

00:00:51.090 --> 00:00:52.780
And if you look at the surface of water,

00:00:52.780 --> 00:00:54.250
it might look completely smooth.

00:00:54.250 --> 00:00:55.920
But if you were to zoom
in on a molecular level,

00:00:55.920 --> 00:00:58.200
you'll see that, well, it's
just made up of these molecules.

00:00:58.200 --> 00:01:00.490
But roughly speaking, roughly speaking,

00:01:00.490 --> 00:01:02.020
let's just say that this is roughly

00:01:02.020 --> 00:01:05.593
the surface, the surface of the water.

00:01:05.593 --> 00:01:07.950
The surface of the water.

00:01:07.950 --> 00:01:09.620
Now, what's going on at the surface?

00:01:09.620 --> 00:01:10.690
Well, all these molecules

00:01:10.690 --> 00:01:12.590
are interacting through hydrogen bonds.

00:01:12.590 --> 00:01:14.190
Let's say this molecule right over here,

00:01:14.190 --> 00:01:17.510
it has hydrogen bonds
pulling on it upwards,

00:01:17.510 --> 00:01:19.390
up to this one, pulling it this way,

00:01:19.390 --> 00:01:21.420
pulling it downwards,
pulling it in really,

00:01:21.420 --> 00:01:25.620
really, to some degree,
almost every direction.

00:01:25.620 --> 00:01:27.190
And they all have their kinetic energy

00:01:27.190 --> 00:01:28.320
and they're bumping around, but they're

00:01:28.320 --> 00:01:29.450
flowing past each other.

00:01:29.450 --> 00:01:32.610
The hydrogen bonds are
giving that cohesiveness.

00:01:32.610 --> 00:01:34.670
The molecules are attracted to each other.

00:01:34.670 --> 00:01:37.420
But if you look at the
molecules on the surface,

00:01:37.420 --> 00:01:38.750
if you look at the ones on the surface,

00:01:38.750 --> 00:01:41.150
sure, they might have
stuff pulling down on them,

00:01:41.150 --> 00:01:44.620
they might have stuff
pulling them to the side,

00:01:44.620 --> 00:01:48.220
but they don't have anything
pulling on them from above.

00:01:48.220 --> 00:01:50.120
And because of this, you could imagine

00:01:50.120 --> 00:01:52.790
that they're able to get a
little bit more densely packed,

00:01:52.790 --> 00:01:55.420
that they're able to get a
little closer to their neighbors.

00:01:55.420 --> 00:01:57.690
And this is what allows
them to actually have

00:01:57.690 --> 00:02:01.120
a stronger, I guess you could
say, intermolecular force

00:02:01.120 --> 00:02:04.110
at the surface than you
have within the body,

00:02:04.110 --> 00:02:08.090
and that causes a phenomenon
known as surface tension.

00:02:08.090 --> 00:02:12.800
So you have stronger, you
have kind of a deeper,

00:02:12.800 --> 00:02:14.450
and this is still just hydrogen bonds,

00:02:14.450 --> 00:02:15.450
but since they're not being pulled

00:02:15.450 --> 00:02:17.590
in other directions
by, upwards by the air,

00:02:17.590 --> 00:02:20.020
they're able to get a little
bit more closely packed,

00:02:20.020 --> 00:02:21.950
a little bit tighter, and this we refer to

00:02:21.950 --> 00:02:26.950
as surface tension, surface tension.

00:02:27.090 --> 00:02:29.820
And you have probably
observed surface tension

00:02:29.820 --> 00:02:32.150
many, many, many times in your life

00:02:32.150 --> 00:02:35.320
in the form of, say, a water droplet.

00:02:35.320 --> 00:02:40.320
A water droplet, it's able to
have this roughly round shape

00:02:40.450 --> 00:02:42.350
because all the little water molecules

00:02:42.350 --> 00:02:44.790
on the surface of the water droplet,

00:02:44.790 --> 00:02:46.090
and here the surface might even be

00:02:46.090 --> 00:02:47.520
on the bottom of the water droplet.

00:02:47.520 --> 00:02:48.820
They are more attracted to each other

00:02:48.820 --> 00:02:50.820
than they are to the surrounding air,

00:02:50.820 --> 00:02:53.220
so they're able to form
this type of a shape.

00:02:53.220 --> 00:02:55.190
You might've seen it if you go to a pond

00:02:55.190 --> 00:02:57.950
or a stream sometimes, so
you see some still water.

00:02:57.950 --> 00:03:00.550
And let's say, let me do this in blue.

00:03:00.550 --> 00:03:03.350
So let's say that this is the surface

00:03:03.350 --> 00:03:05.550
of the water right over here.

00:03:05.550 --> 00:03:07.850
You might have seen
insects that are able to

00:03:07.850 --> 00:03:09.880
walk on the surface of the water.

00:03:09.880 --> 00:03:11.520
And I'm not doing a great
job at drawing the insects.

00:03:11.520 --> 00:03:12.950
They don't look exactly like that.

00:03:12.950 --> 00:03:14.790
But they can walk on the
surface of the water.

00:03:14.790 --> 00:03:17.020
You might've seen or
you might've even tried

00:03:17.020 --> 00:03:19.050
to do something like put
a paperclip on the water.

00:03:19.050 --> 00:03:20.820
And even though this thing
is actually more dense

00:03:20.820 --> 00:03:22.690
than the water and you
might expect it to sink,

00:03:22.690 --> 00:03:24.320
but because of the surface tension,

00:03:24.320 --> 00:03:27.390
which really forms something
of a film on top of the water,

00:03:27.390 --> 00:03:29.490
the thing won't penetrate the surface,

00:03:29.490 --> 00:03:32.220
so the paperclip will
float, unless you were to

00:03:32.220 --> 00:03:34.120
push on it a little bit and it allow it

00:03:34.120 --> 00:03:35.850
to puncture the surface, and then

00:03:35.850 --> 00:03:38.050
it would actually sink, which
is what you would expect

00:03:38.050 --> 00:03:40.580
because it is actually denser.

00:03:40.580 --> 00:03:43.390
You'd even see this if
you were to take a cup,

00:03:43.390 --> 00:03:46.510
if you were to take a cup
and you were to fill it

00:03:46.510 --> 00:03:49.190
all the way up to the rim
and then a little bit higher,

00:03:49.190 --> 00:03:51.150
it won't immediately overflow.

00:03:51.150 --> 00:03:52.320
It won't immediately overflow.

00:03:52.320 --> 00:03:53.450
If you're very careful, you'll see

00:03:53.450 --> 00:03:54.990
that you form a bulge here.

00:03:54.990 --> 00:03:57.480
And that bulges because those
individual water molecules

00:03:57.480 --> 00:03:59.690
are more attracted to each other

00:03:59.690 --> 00:04:02.020
than they are to the surrounding air.

00:04:02.020 --> 00:04:04.610
So that allows for
something of a little bulge.

00:04:04.610 --> 00:04:06.200
Obviously if you keep
pouring water, at some point,

00:04:06.200 --> 00:04:07.790
they're just gonna start overflowing

00:04:07.790 --> 00:04:09.310
because gravity's gonna take over there.

00:04:09.310 --> 00:04:11.880
Gravity's gonna overwhelm
the surface tension.

00:04:11.880 --> 00:04:16.220
But this bulge will actually form.

00:04:16.220 --> 00:04:18.390
So surface tension, it is really due to

00:04:18.390 --> 00:04:20.170
the cohesion of the water.

00:04:20.170 --> 00:04:21.650
Remember, cohesion is when the molecules

00:04:21.650 --> 00:04:23.490
are attracted to each other.

00:04:23.490 --> 00:04:25.190
And it definitely, and
especially because they're

00:04:25.190 --> 00:04:29.090
more attracted to each other
than the surrounding air.
