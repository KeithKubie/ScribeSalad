[NC]: Halloweentown high

00:00:16.580 --> 00:00:19.640
Yeah, okay... They made so many of these movies,

00:00:19.640 --> 00:00:24.260
I'm surprised there's not a "Halloweentown Surfs Up" or "How to Cook with Halloweentown"

00:00:24.260 --> 00:00:26.560
I mean the possibilities are endless aren't they?

00:00:27.140 --> 00:00:29.940
The first one I couldn't really get into aside from the makeup and the second one

00:00:29.940 --> 00:00:36.500
I thought was legitimately enjoyable even though they were bound to just a few locations the third one falls somewhere in between

00:00:36.980 --> 00:00:44.000
It pretty much just jumps right in there as we see our favorite family is toying with the idea of maybe having kids from Halloweentown go to school

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:46.920
In the real world. In literally a flash, the eldest daughter

00:00:47.400 --> 00:00:52.860
(Who is actually the only daughter now the youngest one seems to have just disappeared).. Yeah, Honestly no big loss

00:00:53.060 --> 00:00:57.120
Is in front of the Halloween Town Council as willing to put her idea to the test except

00:00:57.129 --> 00:01:00.399
well her magic is on the line as well as the magic of her entire family.

00:01:00.670 --> 00:01:06.970
Oops.. So the kids from Halloween town are in disguise as Canadians. (Yeah for an exchange there,

00:01:06.970 --> 00:01:08.620
that's really gonna be a culture shock.)

00:01:08.980 --> 00:01:13.000
Who are dressed up as humans and are trying to be shown that monsters and humans can get along.

00:01:13.400 --> 00:01:16.240
But unfortunately this evil organization known as the Knights.

00:01:16.420 --> 00:01:21.960
Wants to keep these two groups separate because they still think humans are evil, not tolerant and are just gonna be awful for them.

00:01:21.960 --> 00:01:25.740
And as we discover, they're willing to do anything to keep them apart.

00:01:26.340 --> 00:01:32.560
I'm not gonna lie when I heard Halloweentown High the first thing that came in my head is "oh cool a school in Halloweentown!"

00:01:33.180 --> 00:01:34.920
seeing a bunch of ghouls and monsters

00:01:34.920 --> 00:01:40.960
learn all sorts of creative things. It's kind of a letdown knowing not only is it monsters going to the real world school.

00:01:40.960 --> 00:01:46.029
But it's monsters that aren't even allowed to be monsters. They have to be in disguise looking like real kids.

00:01:46.029 --> 00:01:47.460
That's not much fun.

00:01:47.720 --> 00:01:52.260
Because of this we don't really get that much in terms of visuals and weird makeup and such.

00:01:52.400 --> 00:01:54.660
Every once in a whilethere's something cool like

00:01:54.660 --> 00:01:57.720
marshmallow spiders, a bag that walks and eats people.

00:01:57.920 --> 00:02:01.299
And even the Halloween kids are allowed to take off their disguises once in a while

00:02:01.299 --> 00:02:05.498
And is it me or did Dreamworks Trolls totally ripped us off?

00:02:05.500 --> 00:02:10.740
Thankfully though the movie mostly makes up with this with some okay writing and some genuinely good performances.

00:02:10.740 --> 00:02:14.960
I mean for a Disney Channel movie. I think we know we're not gonna get anything spectacular here.

00:02:15.080 --> 00:02:21.060
It's funny seeing these actors who are just so uncomfortable and awkward in the first film suddenly seem very

00:02:21.100 --> 00:02:27.540
natural and very interested in what they're saying as any good actor should be. Any weird strange stuff

00:02:27.540 --> 00:02:33.920
they have to say they really try their hardest to make sound like this is just an everyday thing. And even the humans reacting to

00:02:33.920 --> 00:02:39.440
Their odd ways get a few laughs. I especially love this boy's reaction when all the kids suddenly disappear into one car

00:02:40.920 --> 00:02:43.460
[Cody]: Why does none of this surprise me?

00:02:43.740 --> 00:02:46.220
[NC]: That seems so believable to me.

00:02:46.920 --> 00:02:50.060
The message is made pretty clear as the villains once they're revealed

00:02:50.060 --> 00:02:54.220
are trying to make a whole group of people look bad based on the actions of only a few.

00:02:54.560 --> 00:03:02.120
And I'm not gonna lie while I'm recording this and watching the news, this message does hold a lot more relevance now than it probably did back then.

00:03:02.540 --> 00:03:06.420
It's kind of like Zootopia what I thought was a little too obvious and in-your-face.

00:03:06.420 --> 00:03:09.220
Sadly it turns out is very very needed nowadays.

00:03:09.420 --> 00:03:13.020
So I guess even it's very simple message has a lot more relevance.

00:03:13.520 --> 00:03:18.580
The only thing that was starting to get on my nerves a little bit the performance of the brother. I don't know.

00:03:18.580 --> 00:03:25.340
He's seeming a little too one-note to me just always complaining always whining making fun of everything. Don't get me wrong

00:03:25.340 --> 00:03:27.380
this is very hard dialogue to make sound

00:03:27.400 --> 00:03:33.400
likable. And gets even stranger when he starts dating one of the kids from Halloweentown until he sees what she really looks like and

00:03:33.400 --> 00:03:38.579
suddenly he's disgusted. It's given a little bit of a spin we discover. She thinks he's disgusting too.

00:03:38.650 --> 00:03:43.079
It's kind of an interesting point of view for kids the gross monster sees us as gross monsters.

00:03:43.120 --> 00:03:45.720
But in the end when it looks like they're gonna see past it

00:03:45.720 --> 00:03:51.100
they still say that they find each other gross, and they just decided to be friends. What a confusing message.

00:03:51.460 --> 00:03:55.560
So yeah where there are a lot of possibilities that should have been taken advantage of? Yes.

00:03:55.560 --> 00:03:58.420
Are there a lot more creative elements that should have been here? Absolutely.

00:03:58.940 --> 00:04:02.740
But for what it is it kept my interest I wanted to know what was gonna happen

00:04:02.829 --> 00:04:05.399
I want to know how they're gonna get out of the predicament.

00:04:05.400 --> 00:04:11.189
I enjoy the monsters point of view as well as the humans point of view and when they did have those creative elements they were

00:04:11.189 --> 00:04:16.258
a lot of fun. I guess if you're curious to see it just to say you've seen all the Halloweentown movies

00:04:16.260 --> 00:04:17.860
It's not bad to check out.

00:04:18.140 --> 00:04:24.180
It's not gonna take anything to new levels or anything, but that's totally ok. Nothing while worthy, but passable enough.

00:04:39.400 --> 00:04:41.400
