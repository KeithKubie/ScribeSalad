ANJALI JOSHI: So welcome
everybody to Google.

00:00:11.480 --> 00:00:12.310
My name is Anjali.

00:00:12.310 --> 00:00:15.940
And I'm a VP in the Next
Billion User team at Google,

00:00:15.940 --> 00:00:18.190
focused on India products.

00:00:18.190 --> 00:00:20.170
Today, I have the
immense pleasure

00:00:20.170 --> 00:00:22.960
of welcoming a living
legend, the very

00:00:22.960 --> 00:00:28.490
talented and internationally
renowned Asha Bhosleji.

00:00:28.490 --> 00:00:31.060
Ashaji is perhaps the most
senior artist in Hindi films

00:00:31.060 --> 00:00:32.500
who is still performing.

00:00:32.500 --> 00:00:36.940
She started her career in 1943,
in pre-independence British

00:00:36.940 --> 00:00:39.070
India, and is
still going strong.

00:00:39.070 --> 00:00:41.800

grown up on her songs,

00:00:41.800 --> 00:00:43.330
your grandparents have as well.

00:00:48.150 --> 00:00:50.890
Her first song was
recorded at the age of 10.

00:00:50.890 --> 00:00:53.210
And today, she is still singing.

00:00:53.210 --> 00:00:57.460
She's done over a
thousand Bollywood movies.

00:00:57.460 --> 00:00:59.770
In addition, she's recorded
several private albums

00:00:59.770 --> 00:01:01.450
with many other stars.

00:01:01.450 --> 00:01:05.710
And she has sung
over 12,000 songs

00:01:05.710 --> 00:01:07.690
and is in "The Guinness
Book of World Records."

then there's no point.
