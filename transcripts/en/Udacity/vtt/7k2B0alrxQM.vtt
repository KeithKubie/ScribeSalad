00:00:00.150 --> 00:00:03.940
The percentage relationship you have with any given relative or

00:00:03.940 --> 00:00:06.520
one of your family members is what we call Identity

00:00:06.520 --> 00:00:10.640
by Descent or IBD. This is a number that's assigned

00:00:10.640 --> 00:00:14.010
to each family member that indicates the percentage of a genome

00:00:14.010 --> 00:00:15.750
that you would share with them based on your common

00:00:15.750 --> 00:00:18.360
ancesters. In the same way that we have an IBS

00:00:18.360 --> 00:00:22.050
score. We have an IBD score and they're both measured

00:00:22.050 --> 00:00:25.340
from a range of zero to 100%. But in the case

00:00:25.340 --> 00:00:28.440
of the IBS score, we generally go from a range

00:00:28.440 --> 00:00:32.800
of about 70% to 100%. Right? And that's sampling SNVs

00:00:32.800 --> 00:00:36.310
across the whole genome. But an IBD score can get

00:00:36.310 --> 00:00:40.110
down pretty close to zero. It's almost never completely 0%. Remember,

00:00:40.110 --> 00:00:43.460
we're all related through common ancestors at some point. So

00:00:43.460 --> 00:00:45.820
we share some relations, but it gets to a very

00:00:45.820 --> 00:00:48.080
low percentage at some point. And we can be all

00:00:48.080 --> 00:00:50.370
the way up to 100% obviously if you compare it to

00:00:50.370 --> 00:00:53.150
your own genome or if you have an identical twin.

00:00:53.150 --> 00:00:55.080
So, in a way, what we're looking for is to see

00:00:55.080 --> 00:00:59.010
where you're closest genetic relatives are to your furthest genetic

00:00:59.010 --> 00:01:02.710
relatives. You may remember from lesson 5 when I introduced the

00:01:02.710 --> 00:01:05.349
idea of the family rainbow right instead of the family

00:01:05.349 --> 00:01:07.530
tree. And what it allows us to do is sort of

00:01:07.530 --> 00:01:09.580
do these categories, this hierarchical

00:01:09.580 --> 00:01:13.010
relationships using this different colors.

00:01:13.010 --> 00:01:15.740
We can fill in each tier here, right, you 100% related

00:01:15.740 --> 00:01:18.680
to you. Your siblings and your parents,

00:01:18.680 --> 00:01:22.370
your 50% related to. Your half siblings, grandparents,

00:01:22.370 --> 00:01:24.990
aunts, uncles, you're 25%. And then it

00:01:24.990 --> 00:01:28.430
gets pretty complicated quickly, 12.5% related to your

00:01:28.430 --> 00:01:31.469
first cousins, grand uncles, great grandparents. And

00:01:31.469 --> 00:01:35.240
then 6.25% related to your first cousin once

00:01:35.240 --> 00:01:38.610
removed, great grand aunt, great-great grandparents. And all

00:01:38.610 --> 00:01:40.910
kinds of other shrubby like things coming off

00:01:40.910 --> 00:01:43.570
this tree, or our family rainbow. And we can keep

00:01:43.570 --> 00:01:46.660
going out. But what I like about the family rainbow

00:01:46.660 --> 00:01:49.650
is it allows us to organize our relatives in a

00:01:49.650 --> 00:01:53.160
way that allows us to easily visualize these tiers of genetic

00:01:53.160 --> 00:01:56.330
relatedness to each other. Now this is all well and

00:01:56.330 --> 00:01:59.140
good if we know our relationship with our family members already.

00:01:59.140 --> 00:02:01.940
But, how do we calculate this percentage. Which is equal

00:02:01.940 --> 00:02:06.560
to the IBD, the Identity by Descent score for unknown relations.

00:02:06.560 --> 00:02:10.199
Let's actually go talk to somebody about how this IBD score is determined.
