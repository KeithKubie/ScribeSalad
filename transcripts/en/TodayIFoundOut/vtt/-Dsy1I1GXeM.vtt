00:00:04.040 --> 00:00:10.180
The 525-foot skyscraper at 20 Fenchurch Street
in London, England earned the nickname “Walkie

00:00:10.180 --> 00:00:12.000
Talkie” thanks to its unique design.

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:16.640
Slim at the bottom and wider at the top, locals
could not help noticing its similarities to

00:00:16.640 --> 00:00:18.840
a handheld, two-way radio.

00:00:18.840 --> 00:00:24.270
However the Walkie Talkie also has another
nickname- Walkie Scorchie.

00:00:24.270 --> 00:00:29.680
Construction began on the skyscraper in 2011
amidst controversy surrounding its appearance;

00:00:29.680 --> 00:00:34.700
it was complete enough for its first tenant
to take up residence in May of 2014.

00:00:34.700 --> 00:00:36.980
Construction finished in August of that same
year.

00:00:36.980 --> 00:00:42.950
However, long before completion, in September
of 2013, the director of Moderna Contracts,

00:00:42.950 --> 00:00:48.080
Martin Lindsay, parked his car across the
street from the south side of the Walkie Talkie

00:00:48.080 --> 00:00:49.080
building.

00:00:49.080 --> 00:00:53.930
His Jaguar XJ was in a parking space there
for an hour or two before he returned to find

00:00:53.930 --> 00:01:00.340
the plastic mirror, Jaguar emblem, and other
parts of his car had been melted by sunlight

00:01:00.340 --> 00:01:02.399
reflected from the Walkie Talkie.

00:01:02.399 --> 00:01:06.470
Lindasy told the BBC about his experience
returning to his car that day: “I was walking

00:01:06.470 --> 00:01:11.000
down the road and saw a photographer taking
photos and asked, ‘what’s happening?’

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:13.010
The photographer asked me ‘have you seen
that car?

00:01:13.010 --> 00:01:14.010
The owner won’t be happy.’

00:01:14.010 --> 00:01:16.080
I said ‘I am the owner.

00:01:16.080 --> 00:01:17.890
Crikey, that’s awful.’”

00:01:17.890 --> 00:01:21.580
Fortunately for Lindsay, the construction
company owned up to the damage and left a

00:01:21.580 --> 00:01:24.640
note on his windshield asking for him to give
them a call.

00:01:24.640 --> 00:01:28.620
They paid for the repairs, costing £946,
or about $1,400.

00:01:28.620 --> 00:01:34.640
But Lindsay’s luxury Jaguar was not the
only casualty of the Walkie Talkie’s so-called

00:01:34.640 --> 00:01:35.640
‘death ray.’

00:01:35.640 --> 00:01:40.260
A van owned by heating and air conditioning
engineer Eddie Cannon received similar treatment.

00:01:40.260 --> 00:01:42.620
He stated of the inside of his van“…

00:01:42.620 --> 00:01:47.049
every bit of plastic on the left hand side
and everything on the dashboard has melted,

00:01:47.049 --> 00:01:50.490
including a bottle… that looks like it has
been baked.”

00:01:50.490 --> 00:01:54.750
Certain businesses on the southern side of
the skyscraper also sustained heat damage,

00:01:54.750 --> 00:01:57.640
including cracked tiles and singed carpets.

00:01:57.640 --> 00:02:10.259
One business owner even 
fried an egg and toasted a baguette in the

00:02:10.259 --> 00:02:11.870
light from the building.

00:02:11.870 --> 00:02:13.379
So what’s going on here?

00:02:13.379 --> 00:02:18.219
The south side of the Walkie Talkie curves
into a concave shape, resulting in light reflected

00:02:18.219 --> 00:02:22.370
from a large area being concentrated into
a small one.

00:02:22.370 --> 00:02:26.159
Architect Rafael Viñoly designed the building,
knowing that the concave on the south side

00:02:26.159 --> 00:02:27.159
would have this problem.

00:02:27.159 --> 00:02:28.159
(In fact, another building he designed in
Las Vegas has a very similar problem scorching

00:02:28.159 --> 00:02:29.159
hotel guests, more on this in the Bonus Facts
below.)

00:02:29.159 --> 00:02:31.800
But he and his team did not expect the building
to produce nearly as much heat as it does

00:02:31.800 --> 00:02:33.319
at certain times on sunny days.

00:02:33.319 --> 00:02:37.650
Viñoly told the Guardian: “When it [the
problem] was spotted on a second design iteration,

00:02:37.650 --> 00:02:40.680
we judged the temperature was going to be
about 36 degrees [Celsius]…

00:02:40.680 --> 00:02:45.360
But it’s turned out to be more like 72 degrees
[Celsius].”

00:02:45.360 --> 00:02:50.040
(That would be about 161 degrees Fahrenheit.)

00:02:50.040 --> 00:02:53.270
After paying to fix the damages done by their
building, the owners of the Walkie Talkie

00:02:53.270 --> 00:02:56.889
installed a temporary sunshade in early 2014.

00:02:56.889 --> 00:03:01.200
This device consisted of a dark screen that
prevented the reflected sunlight from causing

00:03:01.200 --> 00:03:02.200
damage.

00:03:02.200 --> 00:03:05.950
The permanent fix consisted of installing
horizontal aluminum fins throughout the offending

00:03:05.950 --> 00:03:10.549
south side, which diminished the view a bit
from inside the building, but also killed

00:03:10.549 --> 00:03:11.549
the “death ray”.

00:03:11.549 --> 00:03:16.120
As mentioned, this isn’t the only time world
renowned architect Rafael Viñoly has dealt

00:03:16.120 --> 00:03:19.379
with the consequences of the Sun reflecting
off one of his buildings.

00:03:19.379 --> 00:03:24.150
He designed the Vdara hotel in Las Vegas which
similarly has a so-called “death ray”

00:03:24.150 --> 00:03:25.439
due to the concave shape.

00:03:25.439 --> 00:03:30.069
In this case, different areas on the pool
deck get affected throughout the day.

00:03:30.069 --> 00:03:34.819
In one reported instance, hotel guest Bill
Pintas had his hair singed while he was lounging

00:03:34.819 --> 00:03:37.139
by the pool and the “death ray” moved
over him.

00:03:37.139 --> 00:03:41.360
He ran from the area as it began burning him
and when he got back after the heat ray had

00:03:41.360 --> 00:03:45.699
moved on, a plastic bag holding a newspaper
next to where he’d been sitting had partially

00:03:45.699 --> 00:03:48.159
melted, which he took a picture of for documentation.

00:03:48.159 --> 00:03:53.109
He was told by hotel workers nearby that they’d
even seen disposable drink containers melt

00:03:53.109 --> 00:04:10.680
under the power of 
this reflection.
