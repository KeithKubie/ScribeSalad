ADAM LEONARD: My name is
Adam Leonard from the People

00:00:04.240 --> 00:00:05.910
Development Departments.

00:00:05.910 --> 00:00:09.590
And I'm so excited to welcome
one of my good friends, who

00:00:09.590 --> 00:00:12.670
I've known for about
10 years now or so--

00:00:12.670 --> 00:00:15.120
Diane Hamilton, who
is here with us today.

00:00:15.120 --> 00:00:17.080
So Diane is an author.

00:00:17.080 --> 00:00:20.460
She's a meditation teacher,
and a professional mediator

00:00:20.460 --> 00:00:21.420
as well.

00:00:21.420 --> 00:00:24.380
And I can't wait to
see what she shares.

00:00:24.380 --> 00:00:26.637
So Diane, let me invite you up.

00:00:26.637 --> 00:00:28.095
DIANE MUSHO HAMILTON:
Thanks, Adam.

00:00:28.095 --> 00:00:29.045
[APPLAUSE]

00:00:29.045 --> 00:00:29.995
Thanks, everybody.

00:00:32.845 --> 00:00:34.221
Sounds like my mic is on.

00:00:34.221 --> 00:00:34.720
Yeah?

00:00:34.720 --> 00:00:36.110
You can hear me OK?

00:00:36.110 --> 00:00:39.090
Well, first of all, thank
you, Adam, for having me.

00:00:39.090 --> 00:00:40.100
It's such a pleasure.

00:00:40.100 --> 00:00:42.900
And I told him that I've
been on the Google campus

00:00:42.900 --> 00:00:43.810
now for two days.

00:00:43.810 --> 00:00:46.760
We did some training
work two days ago.

00:00:46.760 --> 00:00:49.630
I facilitated a team
meeting all day yesterday.

00:00:49.630 --> 00:00:52.434
And I've decided that
Google is the mecca.

00:00:52.434 --> 00:00:53.850
People need to
come to Google just

00:00:53.850 --> 00:00:56.990
to find out in what domain
you need to upgrade your life.

00:00:56.990 --> 00:00:58.680
You can figure
out what foods you

00:00:58.680 --> 00:01:02.650
should be eating, what physical
practices you should have,

00:01:02.650 --> 00:01:04.500
what kinds of
technology is available.

00:01:04.500 --> 00:01:08.330
It's so exciting and wondrous,
from one point of view.

00:01:08.330 --> 00:01:10.100
I mean, it's really
kind of miraculous

00:01:10.100 --> 00:01:13.600
how many movements and
culture, like different kinds

00:01:13.600 --> 00:01:16.770
of movements have found
their home here and held

00:01:16.770 --> 00:01:19.980
in what used to be considered
a corporate setting.

00:01:19.980 --> 00:01:21.860
I think it would be
hard to call it that.

00:01:21.860 --> 00:01:24.860
I'm not quite sure what the new
language is, but just the sense

00:01:24.860 --> 00:01:26.870
that you're actually
really integrated and alive

00:01:26.870 --> 00:01:31.070
and enjoying being
a human being.

00:01:31.070 --> 00:01:32.570
So I wrote a book.

00:01:32.570 --> 00:01:34.580
And my book was
published last December.

00:01:34.580 --> 00:01:36.746
And I think there were going
to be some copies here.

00:01:36.746 --> 00:01:38.060
They may still be arriving.

00:01:38.060 --> 00:01:40.450
The book is called
"Everything is Workable."

00:01:40.450 --> 00:01:44.250
And there's a really beautiful
publisher out of Boston

00:01:44.250 --> 00:01:46.220
called Shambhala Publications.

00:01:46.220 --> 00:01:47.850
Do any of you know
Shambhala Books?

00:01:47.850 --> 00:01:48.350
Yeah.

00:01:48.350 --> 00:01:50.780
So Shambhala is
interesting, because they

00:01:50.780 --> 00:01:53.900
were one of the first
companies way back in, I think,

00:01:53.900 --> 00:01:57.180
the early '60s or
'70s to really want

00:01:57.180 --> 00:02:00.560
to bring the wisdom of
the East to the West.

00:02:00.560 --> 00:02:04.490
And so they were
devoted to Zen texts.

00:02:04.490 --> 00:02:07.970
They were devoted to
sort of Asian wisdom.

00:02:07.970 --> 00:02:10.349
And there was also a book
that really made the company.

00:02:10.349 --> 00:02:11.640
I don't know if you know of it.

00:02:11.640 --> 00:02:15.100
The book was called "The
Art of War" by Sun Tzu.

00:02:15.100 --> 00:02:17.940
So that book was translated
and published in English

00:02:17.940 --> 00:02:19.260
first by Shambhala.

00:02:19.260 --> 00:02:22.970
And basically, as
I understand it,

00:02:22.970 --> 00:02:25.600
was the financial success
point for that company.

00:02:25.600 --> 00:02:28.010
So I was really privileged
to be approached by Shambhala

00:02:28.010 --> 00:02:32.460
and asked as a meditation
teacher, Zen practitioner,

00:02:32.460 --> 00:02:35.890
and also a mediator, whether
I was interested in working

00:02:35.890 --> 00:02:38.060
with them to bring
something into print.

00:02:38.060 --> 00:02:42.290
So really, if you think
about the word "meditation,"

00:02:42.290 --> 00:02:47.380
the word "meditation" has that
root, "med-" in it, I think,

00:02:47.380 --> 00:02:48.770
which is probably Latin.

00:02:48.770 --> 00:02:51.790
Does anybody know actually how
it translates from the Latin?

00:02:51.790 --> 00:02:53.360
I don't know exactly.

00:02:53.360 --> 00:02:57.070
But "meditate" and
"mediate" both literally

00:02:57.070 --> 00:02:59.950
mean "to bring two into one."

00:02:59.950 --> 00:03:03.780
So with meditation, when
you sit down on the cushion,

00:03:03.780 --> 00:03:05.980
you're bringing your
body, speech, and mind

00:03:05.980 --> 00:03:07.190
into one moment.

00:03:07.190 --> 00:03:09.560
And you're creating
coherence with your life.

00:03:09.560 --> 00:03:12.490
So you could say meditation
is a way of becoming one

00:03:12.490 --> 00:03:15.170
with your life,
whereas mediation

00:03:15.170 --> 00:03:17.980
is about bringing two
differing points of view

00:03:17.980 --> 00:03:21.300
or two different sets of
interests or a conflict

00:03:21.300 --> 00:03:24.500
in which there are many
parties into one solution.

00:03:24.500 --> 00:03:27.180
So the impulse of
meditation and of mediation

00:03:27.180 --> 00:03:28.970
are really the same impulse.

00:03:28.970 --> 00:03:33.010
And so I gave a lot of thought
to both internal conflict

00:03:33.010 --> 00:03:35.350
and also the conflict
that we experience,

00:03:35.350 --> 00:03:38.850
both in our personal
lives and also culturally,

00:03:38.850 --> 00:03:42.300
and you might even
say on a global scale,

00:03:42.300 --> 00:03:45.210
and gave a lot of consideration
to how we work with conflict,

00:03:45.210 --> 00:03:47.820
both within ourselves
and outside of ourselves.

00:03:47.820 --> 00:03:51.610
And I wanted to make
the point that conflict,

00:03:51.610 --> 00:03:55.380
while it is
uncomfortable, is actually

00:03:55.380 --> 00:03:58.550
an incredible developmental
opportunity, that there

00:03:58.550 --> 00:04:01.080
are things that can come
from conflict when you work

00:04:01.080 --> 00:04:03.280
with it in an innovative way.

00:04:03.280 --> 00:04:06.610
And because you are really
a culture of innovators,

00:04:06.610 --> 00:04:10.360
that working with conflict
from a creative point of view

00:04:10.360 --> 00:04:12.770
is-- there's an incredible
amount of growth,

00:04:12.770 --> 00:04:14.490
possibility, and
new solutions that

00:04:14.490 --> 00:04:18.390
can come from it when we
include it as potential.

00:04:18.390 --> 00:04:20.329
The issue that we
have with conflict

00:04:20.329 --> 00:04:23.630
is that the old
hardware, if you will--

00:04:23.630 --> 00:04:25.790
I'm going to try to use
some of your language

00:04:25.790 --> 00:04:29.480
and it's going to be kind of
pathetic, so just work with me.

00:04:29.480 --> 00:04:32.880
So the old evolutionary
hardware does not

00:04:32.880 --> 00:04:35.010
give you the
sensation in your body

00:04:35.010 --> 00:04:37.630
that this is a creative
opportunity, right?

00:04:37.630 --> 00:04:41.169
When the tri-brain-- we
have the reptilian brain,

00:04:41.169 --> 00:04:42.960
the mammalian brain,
and the primate brain.

00:04:42.960 --> 00:04:45.964
And when the reptilian brain
senses a threat-- which

00:04:45.964 --> 00:04:47.880
whenever there's a
conflict, there's a threat.

00:04:47.880 --> 00:04:49.990
There's a threat to our
resources, our identity,

00:04:49.990 --> 00:04:54.910
our physical well-being,
the stability of our life.

00:04:54.910 --> 00:04:59.070
Conflict is, by its nature,
threatening to the status quo.

00:04:59.070 --> 00:05:01.150
So because it's
threatening, what happens

00:05:01.150 --> 00:05:03.700
is that these chemical--
that the reptilian brain

00:05:03.700 --> 00:05:05.350
stimulates the amygdala.

00:05:05.350 --> 00:05:09.420
And the amygdala is
the signal function

00:05:09.420 --> 00:05:13.120
behind the eyes that
stimulates the rest of the body

00:05:13.120 --> 00:05:14.860
to fight or flight or freeze.

00:05:14.860 --> 00:05:19.280
So you get this chemical dump
of cortisol, of adrenaline.

00:05:19.280 --> 00:05:22.710
And so your later
brain can say, oh

00:05:22.710 --> 00:05:25.430
great-- creative opportunity.

00:05:25.430 --> 00:05:28.450
But your body is saying, I'm
getting out of here, right?

00:05:28.450 --> 00:05:31.770
I'm going to fight, flight, or
disappear-- one or the other.

00:05:31.770 --> 00:05:33.800
And so we have this problem.

00:05:33.800 --> 00:05:38.010
We have this problem that
the sensation of conflict

00:05:38.010 --> 00:05:40.670
does not support this notion
that it's an opportunity,

00:05:40.670 --> 00:05:42.360
that it's a creative
possibility.

00:05:42.360 --> 00:05:45.940
Because everything in our body
wants to get away from it.

00:05:45.940 --> 00:05:49.040
The sensations of conflict,
no matter what you do,

00:05:49.040 --> 00:05:50.740
do not feel good.

00:05:50.740 --> 00:05:54.660
And so with enough practice,
you can override that sensation.

00:05:54.660 --> 00:05:56.870
You can start to
wire, if you will,

00:05:56.870 --> 00:06:00.330
the reptilian response to
these higher functions of mind.

00:06:00.330 --> 00:06:03.650
And you can habituate
yourself to reinterpreting it.

00:06:03.650 --> 00:06:05.870
And you can do a
counter-intuitive

00:06:05.870 --> 00:06:07.725
starting to move towards it.

00:06:07.725 --> 00:06:09.100
But there's so
much that you have

00:06:09.100 --> 00:06:12.210
to kind of be able to
master in your own body

00:06:12.210 --> 00:06:13.730
and also in your thoughts.

00:06:13.730 --> 00:06:15.110
Because generally,
as soon as you

00:06:15.110 --> 00:06:19.340
start to have the negative
sensations of adrenaline

00:06:19.340 --> 00:06:22.174
and cortisol, usually
the cognitions follow.

00:06:22.174 --> 00:06:23.840
In other words, your
thoughts are, like,

00:06:23.840 --> 00:06:26.190
ooh, I don't want to be
here, why is this happening,

00:06:26.190 --> 00:06:28.580
that person is wrong,
this should stop.

00:06:28.580 --> 00:06:31.180
So generally, your
thoughts and your body

00:06:31.180 --> 00:06:33.380
both wire to get you
out of the situation.

00:06:33.380 --> 00:06:35.090
Does that make
sense to everybody,

00:06:35.090 --> 00:06:36.240
what it is I'm saying?

00:06:36.240 --> 00:06:36.370
Yeah?

00:06:36.370 --> 00:06:37.870
AUDIENCE: Does the
reverse also hold

00:06:37.870 --> 00:06:40.495
true, where your thoughts
can then [INAUDIBLE]?

00:06:40.495 --> 00:06:41.870
DIANE MUSHO
HAMILTON: Absolutely.

00:06:41.870 --> 00:06:43.620
And that's really what
we're working with,

00:06:43.620 --> 00:06:46.630
is that what happens is you
enter into a feedback loop.

00:06:46.630 --> 00:06:48.640
So when you work with
people with conflict,

00:06:48.640 --> 00:06:51.870
one of the things that you have
to do is you have to-- well,

00:06:51.870 --> 00:06:53.370
I'll give you an
example that's more

00:06:53.370 --> 00:06:54.720
related to my own experience.

00:06:54.720 --> 00:06:56.530
So there's a chapter in my book.

00:06:56.530 --> 00:06:59.680
I was remarried, oh,
it's been now 15 years.

00:06:59.680 --> 00:07:03.360
And I remarried a man
who had three daughters,

00:07:03.360 --> 00:07:04.860
and their mother had died.

00:07:04.860 --> 00:07:07.920
And I had one-- I have one son.

00:07:07.920 --> 00:07:09.340
My son also has Down syndrome.

00:07:09.340 --> 00:07:12.560
He's a genius.

00:07:12.560 --> 00:07:16.770
And so we came together, and it
was incredibly intense for me,

00:07:16.770 --> 00:07:19.820
because they hadn't had a female
in the household for five years

00:07:19.820 --> 00:07:21.150
since their mother died.

00:07:21.150 --> 00:07:24.420
They were all at different
ages-- 16, 13, 9.

00:07:24.420 --> 00:07:27.090
It was really challenging
emotionally for me,

00:07:27.090 --> 00:07:30.790
both to merge into the culture
but also to kind of create

00:07:30.790 --> 00:07:33.020
certain kinds of
organization and patterning

00:07:33.020 --> 00:07:35.020
that would work for
everyone, including me.

00:07:35.020 --> 00:07:36.670
Mostly, that wasn't happening.

00:07:36.670 --> 00:07:40.050
So I would just feel
overwhelmed, irritable.

00:07:40.050 --> 00:07:41.820
I was losing my temper.

00:07:41.820 --> 00:07:44.400
I just was starting,
really, to experience myself

00:07:44.400 --> 00:07:47.680
in a way that was just
really not acceptable.

00:07:47.680 --> 00:07:49.530
So I developed a
practice that when

00:07:49.530 --> 00:07:52.150
I started to feel really
tense and really stressed,

00:07:52.150 --> 00:07:54.830
and that amygdala hijack
started to happen,

00:07:54.830 --> 00:07:56.940
that I would immediately
go upstairs to my room,

00:07:56.940 --> 00:07:58.330
and I would sit down.

00:07:58.330 --> 00:08:01.840
And the first thing I would
do is quiet my thinking mind

00:08:01.840 --> 00:08:04.560
and just sit with the
intensity of the sensation.

00:08:04.560 --> 00:08:06.120
Like where was I feeling this?

00:08:06.120 --> 00:08:08.210
I could feel the increase
in my heart rate.

00:08:08.210 --> 00:08:09.960
I would feel heat in my neck.

00:08:09.960 --> 00:08:13.030
When we're in a conflict,
our primate history,

00:08:13.030 --> 00:08:15.850
we tend to tighten the back
of our neck and our jaw

00:08:15.850 --> 00:08:17.020
and hunch our shoulders.

00:08:17.020 --> 00:08:19.110
And I could feel all
of that in my body.

00:08:19.110 --> 00:08:21.700
My solar plexus felt
like they were on fire.

00:08:21.700 --> 00:08:23.770
There could be a
sensation of nausea.

00:08:23.770 --> 00:08:26.642
And the whole time, my thoughts
are saying, this isn't OK.

00:08:26.642 --> 00:08:28.350
Why are these people
not listening to me?

00:08:28.350 --> 00:08:29.391
What is the problem here?

00:08:29.391 --> 00:08:30.370
They're all insane.

00:08:30.370 --> 00:08:31.537
I'm living in a madhouse.

00:08:31.537 --> 00:08:32.620
I don't like these people.

00:08:32.620 --> 00:08:33.900
I don't want to be with them.

00:08:33.900 --> 00:08:36.110
Now some tiny-- why
are you laughing?

00:08:36.110 --> 00:08:37.226
[LAUGHTER]

00:08:37.226 --> 00:08:38.309
Because you've been there.

00:08:38.309 --> 00:08:44.410
You know this demented voice
that just takes over, right?

00:08:44.410 --> 00:08:46.710
So my first thing
would be to just commit

00:08:46.710 --> 00:08:48.280
to experiencing the sensation.

00:08:48.280 --> 00:08:49.800
Stop the thoughts.

00:08:49.800 --> 00:08:51.240
Experience the sensation.

00:08:51.240 --> 00:08:52.550
Literally receive them.

00:08:52.550 --> 00:08:53.510
Get to know them.

00:08:53.510 --> 00:08:56.580
This is what this really
intelligent, evolutionary

00:08:56.580 --> 00:08:58.342
hardware is telling me.

00:08:58.342 --> 00:08:59.550
Like, what does it feel like?

00:08:59.550 --> 00:09:03.440
It's really organizing
me to get the hell out

00:09:03.440 --> 00:09:04.770
of here, basically.

00:09:04.770 --> 00:09:08.820
So once I could pace that a
little bit, and the sensations

00:09:08.820 --> 00:09:11.270
would start to calm down,
then I could pay attention

00:09:11.270 --> 00:09:12.560
to my thoughts.

00:09:12.560 --> 00:09:19.249
But even with the slightest kind
of attention-- it's amazing.

00:09:19.249 --> 00:09:20.790
What I'm trying to
say is how quickly

00:09:20.790 --> 00:09:22.450
the thoughts
reassert themselves.

00:09:22.450 --> 00:09:23.945
So I would quiet my thoughts.

00:09:23.945 --> 00:09:24.820
I'd be with the body.

00:09:24.820 --> 00:09:27.310
And as soon as I'd turn my
attention back to my thoughts,

00:09:27.310 --> 00:09:29.910
guess who was speaking again?

00:09:29.910 --> 00:09:32.742
Yeah, the demented, insane
person would start speaking.

00:09:32.742 --> 00:09:34.700
And so then I would just
pay attention to that,

00:09:34.700 --> 00:09:38.790
and I would say, OK, what
is the wisdom in this?

00:09:38.790 --> 00:09:41.650
What is actually right
about what I'm thinking?

00:09:41.650 --> 00:09:43.170
Because we have a
tendency when we

00:09:43.170 --> 00:09:46.670
get hijacked like that
to either be completely

00:09:46.670 --> 00:09:50.060
under the spell of the
insanity or completely,

00:09:50.060 --> 00:09:51.119
oh no, it's all fine.

00:09:51.119 --> 00:09:51.910
Well, actually, no.

00:09:51.910 --> 00:09:52.860
That's not the case.

00:09:52.860 --> 00:09:57.480
How do you find this middle way
where you receive the wisdom?

00:09:57.480 --> 00:09:59.780
So I would say, we
need more structure.

00:09:59.780 --> 00:10:01.752
We need to create
some patterns when

00:10:01.752 --> 00:10:02.960
we're having dinner together.

00:10:02.960 --> 00:10:06.030
We need to actually listen
to one another and exchange.

00:10:06.030 --> 00:10:09.400
So I really could
receive the wisdom

00:10:09.400 --> 00:10:11.140
from what I was upset about.

00:10:11.140 --> 00:10:14.410
And then when the thoughts are
now clarified, if you will,

00:10:14.410 --> 00:10:16.760
you receive and
clarify the thoughts,

00:10:16.760 --> 00:10:18.830
those thoughts
start to discipline

00:10:18.830 --> 00:10:20.780
the physiological responses.

00:10:20.780 --> 00:10:23.810
So then it's possible to go
back into the conversation.

00:10:23.810 --> 00:10:25.850
And even if you start
to feel the contraction

00:10:25.850 --> 00:10:27.560
or whatever those
are, you can sort of

00:10:27.560 --> 00:10:29.545
breathe that out
and still assert

00:10:29.545 --> 00:10:32.800
what is it that's important
around what I have to say

00:10:32.800 --> 00:10:37.230
and this whole body of
conflict resolution skills.

00:10:37.230 --> 00:10:39.740
So what I really want
to do is, in the book,

00:10:39.740 --> 00:10:41.850
give you an
opportunity to consider

00:10:41.850 --> 00:10:44.580
the evolution of
the body, consider

00:10:44.580 --> 00:10:47.690
how to work with the benefits
of meditation practice.

00:10:47.690 --> 00:10:49.270
And if you think
about meditation,

00:10:49.270 --> 00:10:51.870
really, as an inner
technology-- that's

00:10:51.870 --> 00:10:54.690
what it is, because you're
used to thinking in terms

00:10:54.690 --> 00:10:57.200
of the innovations--
well, meditation

00:10:57.200 --> 00:11:01.030
is one of the great ways that we
have of navigating our interior

00:11:01.030 --> 00:11:03.720
and heightening the
discipline, if you will,

00:11:03.720 --> 00:11:05.300
of how we perceive.

00:11:05.300 --> 00:11:12.160
And then I wanted to also, for
the-- meditative communities

00:11:12.160 --> 00:11:14.290
don't seem to have great
conflict resolution

00:11:14.290 --> 00:11:19.720
skills, because they don't want
to feel "the conflict," she

00:11:19.720 --> 00:11:22.525
whispered. (WHISPERS)
"The conflict."

00:11:22.525 --> 00:11:25.240
There is no conflict, right?

00:11:25.240 --> 00:11:28.230
So it all becomes kind of
passive-aggressive, right?

00:11:28.230 --> 00:11:32.000
So bringing conflict out
directly for the meditators,

00:11:32.000 --> 00:11:34.150
and for the mediators
to actually see

00:11:34.150 --> 00:11:37.240
how much meditation really
supports the mediation

00:11:37.240 --> 00:11:38.010
practice.

00:11:38.010 --> 00:11:40.970
So those were the two
sets of technologies

00:11:40.970 --> 00:11:43.550
that I was interested in
exchanging in the book.

00:11:43.550 --> 00:11:46.030
But as I got into
writing it, I also

00:11:46.030 --> 00:11:48.720
came to understand that there's
a third perspective that I

00:11:48.720 --> 00:11:51.520
think is really, really helpful
when it comes to really giving

00:11:51.520 --> 00:11:53.140
ourselves an
upgrade, if you will,

00:11:53.140 --> 00:11:56.890
or what do you call it when
you go from 2.0 to 3.0?

00:11:56.890 --> 00:11:58.100
Or where are you at now?

00:11:58.100 --> 00:12:01.030
I don't know,
Google-- what is that

00:12:01.030 --> 00:12:03.050
called when you go from
one level to another?

00:12:03.050 --> 00:12:04.180
Is that an upgrade?

00:12:04.180 --> 00:12:05.060
AUDIENCE: A release.

00:12:05.060 --> 00:12:06.393
DIANE MUSHO HAMILTON: A release?

00:12:06.393 --> 00:12:06.908
OK.

00:12:06.908 --> 00:12:07.804
All right.

00:12:07.804 --> 00:12:08.700
Nice.

00:12:08.700 --> 00:12:10.490
I like that.

00:12:10.490 --> 00:12:15.280
So I realized that it was a
very incomplete discussion

00:12:15.280 --> 00:12:17.630
if I didn't also
include something

00:12:17.630 --> 00:12:20.500
about developmental theory,
meaning that there's

00:12:20.500 --> 00:12:22.620
a whole body of
research out there

00:12:22.620 --> 00:12:25.910
about how adult humans
grow and develop.

00:12:25.910 --> 00:12:27.350
We all know that children do.

00:12:27.350 --> 00:12:30.610
We all know that there are
certain developmental tasks

00:12:30.610 --> 00:12:32.650
that get accomplished
at certain ages.

00:12:32.650 --> 00:12:33.980
But the same is true of adults.

00:12:33.980 --> 00:12:37.700
We also can expand and
grow our perspectives.

00:12:37.700 --> 00:12:39.180
And the reason
that I got thinking

00:12:39.180 --> 00:12:41.700
about developmental
theory is because I

00:12:41.700 --> 00:12:45.330
was the director of dispute
resolution for the state

00:12:45.330 --> 00:12:46.790
judiciary in Utah.

00:12:46.790 --> 00:12:48.530
In other words, I
was responsible,

00:12:48.530 --> 00:12:51.810
back in the '80s, for creating
mediation programs in the court

00:12:51.810 --> 00:12:52.950
system.

00:12:52.950 --> 00:13:00.590
And I was a very
naive and Pollyanna

00:13:00.590 --> 00:13:05.860
and maybe "dumb" is just a good
word, in the sense that I sort

00:13:05.860 --> 00:13:08.230
of was under the impression
that if I just set up

00:13:08.230 --> 00:13:13.970
a nice environment, put some
tea and cookies on the table,

00:13:13.970 --> 00:13:15.530
that people could
come into the room

00:13:15.530 --> 00:13:17.290
and we could work
out the situation,

00:13:17.290 --> 00:13:19.430
whether it was a
barking dog dispute

00:13:19.430 --> 00:13:22.970
or whether it was a conflict
in a team, in an organization,

00:13:22.970 --> 00:13:25.190
or whether it was a
transactional dispute

00:13:25.190 --> 00:13:28.870
over land, a big land exchange
involving federal agencies.

00:13:28.870 --> 00:13:31.640
I assumed with enough goodwill
and the right structures

00:13:31.640 --> 00:13:33.260
and the right
conversation that we

00:13:33.260 --> 00:13:35.480
could get the problem solved.

00:13:35.480 --> 00:13:37.522
And guess what I discovered?

00:13:37.522 --> 00:13:39.990
That it wasn't
really quite true.

00:13:39.990 --> 00:13:41.900
And what seemed to be
at the heart of this

00:13:41.900 --> 00:13:44.650
for me was that I
started to see that there

00:13:44.650 --> 00:13:48.120
were limits to capacity.

00:13:48.120 --> 00:13:50.270
And the capacity that
I started to notice

00:13:50.270 --> 00:13:53.000
was the capacity to
take perspectives.

00:13:53.000 --> 00:13:55.375
And it wasn't
necessarily pathology.

00:13:55.375 --> 00:13:58.690
You know, I wasn't seeing
people who were sick and wrong

00:13:58.690 --> 00:14:01.470
or people who would
have a DSM-III diagnosis

00:14:01.470 --> 00:14:02.860
in the psychological world.

00:14:02.860 --> 00:14:04.600
What I was seeing was
just a whole range

00:14:04.600 --> 00:14:07.440
of people who had
different capacity

00:14:07.440 --> 00:14:09.030
to take different
points of view.

00:14:09.030 --> 00:14:12.190
So I worked with people who
came to me as a mediator who

00:14:12.190 --> 00:14:15.230
literally could not take
their own perspective,

00:14:15.230 --> 00:14:16.260
for whatever reason.

00:14:16.260 --> 00:14:18.690
Maybe they were in an
abusive relationship

00:14:18.690 --> 00:14:21.040
and it had been so long since
someone really asked them

00:14:21.040 --> 00:14:22.320
what they thought.

00:14:22.320 --> 00:14:25.000
I saw people who
were in a culture

00:14:25.000 --> 00:14:28.190
where because they were young,
maybe their opinion didn't

00:14:28.190 --> 00:14:31.370
matter, so they didn't
feel free to speak up.

00:14:31.370 --> 00:14:33.860
There were just some
people who simply had not

00:14:33.860 --> 00:14:36.820
been valued fully enough
to actually realize

00:14:36.820 --> 00:14:39.210
that they had their
own point of view.

00:14:39.210 --> 00:14:41.140
So I would work with
people all the time

00:14:41.140 --> 00:14:44.040
under the assumption that
I was facilitating people

00:14:44.040 --> 00:14:46.206
into agreement, but
there was one person

00:14:46.206 --> 00:14:48.080
who was incredibly
disadvantaged because they

00:14:48.080 --> 00:14:49.580
couldn't advocate
for themselves.

00:14:49.580 --> 00:14:51.100
Does that makes sense?

00:14:51.100 --> 00:14:54.540
So like I say, it started
to look developmental to me.

00:14:54.540 --> 00:14:56.880
I didn't want to
pathologize these people.

00:14:56.880 --> 00:14:59.340
It was a capacity that
wasn't quite online.

00:14:59.340 --> 00:15:00.527
Does that make sense?

00:15:00.527 --> 00:15:02.110
Then there was a
whole slew of people,

00:15:02.110 --> 00:15:04.137
of course, who could
come into mediation,

00:15:04.137 --> 00:15:05.720
they could take their
own perspective,

00:15:05.720 --> 00:15:08.800
but whose couldn't they take?

00:15:08.800 --> 00:15:10.530
Person on the other side.

00:15:10.530 --> 00:15:12.790
Like even to try
it on for a moment.

00:15:12.790 --> 00:15:15.470
There was no
bandwidth, if you will,

00:15:15.470 --> 00:15:17.520
to hold another perspective.

00:15:17.520 --> 00:15:19.990
Because as soon as we
have my perspective

00:15:19.990 --> 00:15:22.670
and I'm considering
yours, what happens

00:15:22.670 --> 00:15:26.536
in the body and the mind when
there are two perspectives?

00:15:26.536 --> 00:15:28.160
What happens when
there are two-- maybe

00:15:28.160 --> 00:15:29.076
engineers can help me.

00:15:29.076 --> 00:15:32.570
If there are two
oppositional qualities, what?

00:15:32.570 --> 00:15:33.890
AUDIENCE: Cognitive dissonance.

00:15:33.890 --> 00:15:36.510
DIANE MUSHO HAMILTON: There's
cognitive dissonance, right?

00:15:36.510 --> 00:15:40.320
There's also an
energetic disequilibrium.

00:15:40.320 --> 00:15:44.410
There's actually a pole in which
energy can run between the two

00:15:44.410 --> 00:15:47.100
and disrupt or upset the system.

00:15:47.100 --> 00:15:48.940
Now, I'm kind of
trying to present

00:15:48.940 --> 00:15:51.340
that that's a good
thing, right, to be

00:15:51.340 --> 00:15:53.180
able to feel that
cognitive dissonance

00:15:53.180 --> 00:15:55.530
or feel that-- I don't know.

00:15:55.530 --> 00:15:57.520
I want you to help me
because you're actually

00:15:57.520 --> 00:16:01.240
trained in physics, and I'm not.

00:16:01.240 --> 00:16:04.010
But whatever that is, if
you have two coexisting

00:16:04.010 --> 00:16:06.070
truths in your head
at any one time,

00:16:06.070 --> 00:16:09.040
you literally have to deal with
the disruption in your body.

00:16:09.040 --> 00:16:10.820
So what do we tend to do?

00:16:10.820 --> 00:16:13.200
We tend to push one
out right away, right?

00:16:13.200 --> 00:16:15.100
Now, if you look at
your average news

00:16:15.100 --> 00:16:17.940
channel on a daily basis,
how many points of view

00:16:17.940 --> 00:16:20.009
are they able to hold?

00:16:20.009 --> 00:16:22.550
They set it up as though they're
going to hold multiple ones.

00:16:22.550 --> 00:16:25.790
And certain facilitator-type
newscasters will.

00:16:25.790 --> 00:16:28.880
But lots of time what you get
is a collapse of perspectives.

00:16:28.880 --> 00:16:31.800
And you get one sound bite
that just can be repeated again

00:16:31.800 --> 00:16:34.520
and again and again,
because we find security,

00:16:34.520 --> 00:16:36.300
because it's a single
truth, because it

00:16:36.300 --> 00:16:37.950
doesn't create ambiguity.

00:16:37.950 --> 00:16:40.000
And I saw lots
and lots of people

00:16:40.000 --> 00:16:41.390
who were capable of that.

00:16:41.390 --> 00:16:44.450
They could hold one truth,
but they couldn't hold two.

00:16:44.450 --> 00:16:45.400
Right?

00:16:45.400 --> 00:16:48.030
Then I started to
see these other kind

00:16:48.030 --> 00:16:49.390
of qualities in people.

00:16:49.390 --> 00:16:52.160
I would see people who
could have no point of view

00:16:52.160 --> 00:16:54.200
for a long period
and be really quiet,

00:16:54.200 --> 00:16:58.310
then I could see them really
very effectively advocate

00:16:58.310 --> 00:16:59.350
for themselves.

00:16:59.350 --> 00:17:01.950
And then I could see them
actually drop their position

00:17:01.950 --> 00:17:04.470
and listen to what
someone else had to say,

00:17:04.470 --> 00:17:06.310
and not simply listen
to it, but actually

00:17:06.310 --> 00:17:08.700
identify with it for
a period of time.

00:17:08.700 --> 00:17:12.180
And then I saw people who
could do even a greater trick.

00:17:12.180 --> 00:17:14.450
They could take a third
person perspective.

00:17:14.450 --> 00:17:18.680
So I, you, it-- they could think
about what a court would do.

00:17:18.680 --> 00:17:21.390
They could think about what
a legal interpretation might

00:17:21.390 --> 00:17:22.280
bring to it.

00:17:22.280 --> 00:17:25.187
They could think about a
social impact on the problem.

00:17:25.187 --> 00:17:27.270
And then, suddenly, there
was a much smaller group

00:17:27.270 --> 00:17:28.960
of people who not
only could they

00:17:28.960 --> 00:17:33.570
hold one, two, perhaps three,
they could hold four, five, six

00:17:33.570 --> 00:17:34.830
perspectives at once.

00:17:34.830 --> 00:17:36.937
They could take a
perspective on the process.

00:17:36.937 --> 00:17:39.020
They could think about how
the process had evolved

00:17:39.020 --> 00:17:41.150
from the past and where
it might go in the future.

00:17:41.150 --> 00:17:43.524
They could think about what
the impact of the facilitator

00:17:43.524 --> 00:17:44.640
was on the process.

00:17:44.640 --> 00:17:47.170
And I started to
say, oh my gosh.

00:17:47.170 --> 00:17:49.650
This is really important.

00:17:49.650 --> 00:17:54.470
This perspective taking, and the
capacity to take perspectives,

00:17:54.470 --> 00:17:58.700
changes the heart of negotiation
at such a fundamental level.

00:17:58.700 --> 00:18:02.390
And we as mediators aren't
even taking it into account.

00:18:02.390 --> 00:18:05.270
We don't even screen for the
number of perspectives somebody

00:18:05.270 --> 00:18:06.210
can take.

00:18:06.210 --> 00:18:08.450
Now I'm assuming
that in your teams,

00:18:08.450 --> 00:18:10.740
that you're pretty good at
throwing the ball around.

00:18:10.740 --> 00:18:12.880
Is that fair?

00:18:12.880 --> 00:18:13.380
Uh-oh.

00:18:16.090 --> 00:18:18.270
I'm projecting a lot of
idealism on your culture,

00:18:18.270 --> 00:18:20.240
so just say yes.

00:18:20.240 --> 00:18:22.330
Say, we're really good at it.

00:18:22.330 --> 00:18:26.070
And then, even more complex,
once you open up the field

00:18:26.070 --> 00:18:28.330
and can hold multiple
perspectives,

00:18:28.330 --> 00:18:31.680
you can hear different cultural
views on the same problem,

00:18:31.680 --> 00:18:33.750
you can see it from
many different angles,

00:18:33.750 --> 00:18:37.380
the further task is how then
do you privilege a perspective?

00:18:37.380 --> 00:18:39.670
What criteria do you
use to privilege?

00:18:39.670 --> 00:18:42.010
And then I'd see these
people that very seamlessly

00:18:42.010 --> 00:18:43.710
could privilege perspectives.

00:18:43.710 --> 00:18:46.740
And so I started to think
in terms of development.

00:18:46.740 --> 00:18:48.930
And shortly thereafter,
I was introduced

00:18:48.930 --> 00:18:53.590
to an American philosopher and
writer and amazing thinker who

00:18:53.590 --> 00:18:56.260
really has included a lot
of developmental theory

00:18:56.260 --> 00:18:57.250
in his work.

00:18:57.250 --> 00:18:59.450
And it really changed
my orientation

00:18:59.450 --> 00:19:02.140
to how I do mediation.

00:19:02.140 --> 00:19:04.950
Because I don't just assume
that everybody's capacity

00:19:04.950 --> 00:19:05.860
is the same.

00:19:05.860 --> 00:19:08.300
I assume that there are
differences in capacity

00:19:08.300 --> 00:19:10.650
and that I have to
take that into account.

00:19:10.650 --> 00:19:13.950
One of the really strange
sort of side effects

00:19:13.950 --> 00:19:15.820
of this difference
is that you would

00:19:15.820 --> 00:19:19.500
find people who were more
fluid with perspectives getting

00:19:19.500 --> 00:19:22.540
the short end of the stick,
in terms of the deal.

00:19:22.540 --> 00:19:23.129
Right?

00:19:23.129 --> 00:19:25.170
Can you think about what
I'm saying for a minute?

00:19:25.170 --> 00:19:29.320
Precisely because they could
hold more, they gave away more.

00:19:29.320 --> 00:19:31.090
And I started to think
there are actually

00:19:31.090 --> 00:19:33.280
ethical implications
to this issue.

00:19:33.280 --> 00:19:37.200
It isn't simply that you're not
able to hold my point of view.

00:19:37.200 --> 00:19:39.050
It's that when we
reach an outcome

00:19:39.050 --> 00:19:41.237
and it involves money, that
you walk away with more

00:19:41.237 --> 00:19:43.320
because you've been so
stubborn and you won't even

00:19:43.320 --> 00:19:45.770
pick up my perspective
on this whole thing.

00:19:45.770 --> 00:19:48.800
So I started to really feel like
there were lots of implications

00:19:48.800 --> 00:19:51.810
to this that I really
needed to consider.

00:19:51.810 --> 00:19:53.840
So if you're interested
in this book,

00:19:53.840 --> 00:19:57.390
you'll find some chapters that
talk about this innate capacity

00:19:57.390 --> 00:20:01.780
and also our ability to work
with complexity, which I know.

00:20:01.780 --> 00:20:04.290
And the more complex
our situation

00:20:04.290 --> 00:20:07.120
and the capacity for
working with complexity

00:20:07.120 --> 00:20:09.580
from developmental
theory, you could say,

00:20:09.580 --> 00:20:13.329
is one of the characteristics
of higher levels of development,

00:20:13.329 --> 00:20:14.620
if you want to put it that way.

00:20:14.620 --> 00:20:17.170
Now don't think about
higher levels of development

00:20:17.170 --> 00:20:20.030
in terms of social
dominator hierarchies.

00:20:20.030 --> 00:20:21.080
That's not the point.

00:20:21.080 --> 00:20:24.860
It's more like the way in which
an atom becomes a molecule

00:20:24.860 --> 00:20:26.280
and becomes more complex.

00:20:26.280 --> 00:20:28.800
And then a molecule
becomes a cell,

00:20:28.800 --> 00:20:30.400
and that becomes more complex.

00:20:30.400 --> 00:20:32.880
So holding perspectives
is like that.

00:20:32.880 --> 00:20:33.574
It's holonic.

00:20:33.574 --> 00:20:35.240
It's not just simply
that you're somehow

00:20:35.240 --> 00:20:36.780
better than the other person.

00:20:36.780 --> 00:20:38.170
That's not the point.

00:20:38.170 --> 00:20:39.210
OK?

00:20:39.210 --> 00:20:42.980
So are you interested in maybe
just tasting a little bit

00:20:42.980 --> 00:20:45.330
about how your perspectives
may have evolved?

00:20:45.330 --> 00:20:47.780
I could take you through
a series of perspectives

00:20:47.780 --> 00:20:49.610
that you could try on.

00:20:49.610 --> 00:20:50.211
OK.

00:20:50.211 --> 00:20:50.710
All right.

00:20:50.710 --> 00:20:53.899
So let me just present it.

00:20:53.899 --> 00:20:55.440
And for those of
you who are actually

00:20:55.440 --> 00:20:58.830
watching the live stream,
if you have a piece of paper

00:20:58.830 --> 00:21:00.250
and maybe a pencil,
and you might

00:21:00.250 --> 00:21:02.250
want to write this down
and just explore this

00:21:02.250 --> 00:21:03.430
while you're by yourselves.

00:21:03.430 --> 00:21:05.971
But maybe you could circle up
with the person who's near you.

00:21:05.971 --> 00:21:08.050
And I could just
invite you to try

00:21:08.050 --> 00:21:10.650
on a perspective,
exchange with each other.

00:21:10.650 --> 00:21:13.000
And then I'll say
"stop," and then we'll

00:21:13.000 --> 00:21:14.060
go to the next level.

00:21:14.060 --> 00:21:16.415
And you'll feel your
perspectives expand.

00:21:16.415 --> 00:21:18.040
And then we'll get
a little bit bigger,

00:21:18.040 --> 00:21:19.390
and then we'll get even bigger.

00:21:19.390 --> 00:21:21.770
So we'll do four
rounds of perspectives.

00:21:21.770 --> 00:21:23.610
Is that interesting to you?

00:21:23.610 --> 00:21:25.670
Do you like the person
you're sitting next to?

00:21:25.670 --> 00:21:28.700
[LAUGHTER]

00:21:28.700 --> 00:21:29.200
All right.

00:21:29.200 --> 00:21:32.060
I'm not going to try
to solve that problem.

00:21:32.060 --> 00:21:33.460
I'm going to leave that to you.

00:21:33.460 --> 00:21:35.970
Adam tells me you're
very capable here.

00:21:35.970 --> 00:21:40.840
So let's think for a
moment about the boundary

00:21:40.840 --> 00:21:41.615
around identity.

00:21:41.615 --> 00:21:43.240
So we're going to
think about identity.

00:21:43.240 --> 00:21:46.070
And we're going to
think of identity

00:21:46.070 --> 00:21:49.240
for a moment as a
set of perspectives

00:21:49.240 --> 00:21:52.450
so that who I am as Diane is
actually a set of perspectives.

00:21:52.450 --> 00:21:53.950
It's a set of memories.

00:21:53.950 --> 00:21:56.670
It's a relationship that
I have to this form.

00:21:56.670 --> 00:21:59.410
It's a set of relationships,
some of which have persisted,

00:21:59.410 --> 00:22:01.330
some of which have changed.

00:22:01.330 --> 00:22:02.860
It's a set of values.

00:22:02.860 --> 00:22:04.440
But those values
have also changed.

00:22:04.440 --> 00:22:07.030
So all those perspectives,
from one point of view,

00:22:07.030 --> 00:22:09.610
make up who I think I am.

00:22:09.610 --> 00:22:11.190
So I'm going to
ask you to explore

00:22:11.190 --> 00:22:13.114
the egocentric perspective.

00:22:13.114 --> 00:22:15.280
But I don't want you to do
it from the point of view

00:22:15.280 --> 00:22:17.410
that the ego is a bad thing.

00:22:17.410 --> 00:22:18.890
Do you get what I'm saying?

00:22:18.890 --> 00:22:22.510
Because lots of times, either
in our religious traditions

00:22:22.510 --> 00:22:25.900
or-- we think of the
ego as somehow bad.

00:22:25.900 --> 00:22:28.060
Why do we think
of the ego as bad?

00:22:28.060 --> 00:22:30.039
Can anyone help me with this?

00:22:30.039 --> 00:22:31.580
AUDIENCE: 'Cause
when it's in charge,

00:22:31.580 --> 00:22:34.134
it kind of makes people shitty?

00:22:34.134 --> 00:22:35.550
DIANE MUSHO HAMILTON:
Yeah, people

00:22:35.550 --> 00:22:38.082
get-- there's just
something quite

00:22:38.082 --> 00:22:39.290
beautiful about what he said.

00:22:39.290 --> 00:22:41.430
When the ego's in charge,
people are shitty.

00:22:41.430 --> 00:22:43.650
That's the long and the short.

00:22:43.650 --> 00:22:46.200
So the ego is not bad.

00:22:46.200 --> 00:22:48.560
The ego is limited.

00:22:48.560 --> 00:22:52.060
The ego is oriented
toward self-sustaining.

00:22:52.060 --> 00:22:54.520
But there is such a
thing as a healthy ego.

00:22:54.520 --> 00:22:57.550
There's a healthy sort
of ecosystem of self,

00:22:57.550 --> 00:23:00.960
which is permeable, and which
can take inputs and give out

00:23:00.960 --> 00:23:01.720
inputs.

00:23:01.720 --> 00:23:04.490
And then the perspective
can shift to include more.

00:23:04.490 --> 00:23:08.880
So an ego becomes bad
when an ego is exclusive.

00:23:08.880 --> 00:23:10.136
Does everybody get that?

00:23:10.136 --> 00:23:11.510
So that's the
thing I want to do.

00:23:11.510 --> 00:23:14.300
A healthy ego is one that
has permeability and is

00:23:14.300 --> 00:23:16.210
able to sort of drop
its reference points

00:23:16.210 --> 00:23:17.620
and expand awareness.

00:23:17.620 --> 00:23:19.950
But it isn't, by its
nature, bad and wrong.

00:23:19.950 --> 00:23:21.850
It's only by its
nature bad and wrong

00:23:21.850 --> 00:23:25.394
when it's exclusive and stops
taking in information or starts

00:23:25.394 --> 00:23:26.310
thinking about others.

00:23:26.310 --> 00:23:27.400
Is that fair?

00:23:27.400 --> 00:23:29.670
Can we work with
that definition?

00:23:29.670 --> 00:23:34.030
So all we're going to do is
just discover, for a moment, who

00:23:34.030 --> 00:23:36.260
I think I am, or what
are the things I notice?

00:23:36.260 --> 00:23:38.300
So I'm going to have
you complete a sentence

00:23:38.300 --> 00:23:41.310
and just go around two or
three times in your group.

00:23:41.310 --> 00:23:45.300
And all I want you to do is say,
as the egocentric self, what

00:23:45.300 --> 00:23:47.560
I notice is-- OK?

00:23:47.560 --> 00:23:49.490
So as the egocentric
self, what I notice

00:23:49.490 --> 00:23:51.870
is I'm a visitor to
a culture and that I

00:23:51.870 --> 00:23:53.530
feel incredibly excited.

00:23:53.530 --> 00:23:55.070
And at the same
time, maybe I might

00:23:55.070 --> 00:23:57.360
be even a little
apprehensive or afraid.

00:23:57.360 --> 00:23:59.000
Just notice what
comes up when you

00:23:59.000 --> 00:24:01.890
identify with the
egocentric self.

00:24:01.890 --> 00:24:03.709
So if you're watching
the live stream,

00:24:03.709 --> 00:24:06.000
just take a minute to jot it
down or think to yourself,

00:24:06.000 --> 00:24:07.030
what do I notice?

00:24:07.030 --> 00:24:10.100
And then we're going to watch
these perspectives grow.

00:24:10.100 --> 00:24:10.600
Here we go.

00:24:10.600 --> 00:24:11.890
I'll give you just,
like, two minutes.

00:24:11.890 --> 00:24:12.850
Two and a half minutes.

00:24:12.850 --> 00:24:15.298
Here we go.

[INTERPOSING VOICES]

00:24:30.600 --> 00:24:33.230
So did we get a
little sample of what

00:24:33.230 --> 00:24:35.741
the perspectives are
like for the ego?

00:24:35.741 --> 00:24:37.240
What are some of
the things that you

00:24:37.240 --> 00:24:39.270
noticed as the egocentric self?

00:24:39.270 --> 00:24:41.406
First of all, what are
you most concerned with?

00:24:41.406 --> 00:24:41.892
AUDIENCE: Yourself.

00:24:41.892 --> 00:24:42.864
AUDIENCE: Things in my day.

00:24:42.864 --> 00:24:44.030
DIANE MUSHO HAMILTON: Hello?

00:24:44.030 --> 00:24:45.160
The self.

00:24:45.160 --> 00:24:45.980
Things in my day.

00:24:45.980 --> 00:24:46.950
What's on my calendar.

00:24:46.950 --> 00:24:47.790
Good.

What else?

00:24:48.535 --> 00:24:50.410
AUDIENCE: How do I fit
into this environment?

00:24:50.410 --> 00:24:52.580
DIANE MUSHO HAMILTON: Yeah,
as the egocentric self,

00:24:52.580 --> 00:24:54.650
how do I fit into this culture?

00:24:54.650 --> 00:24:56.700
How do I fit into
this environment?

00:24:56.700 --> 00:24:58.930
Who am I in the context
that I exist in?

00:24:58.930 --> 00:25:00.480
That's a question
that's persistent.

00:25:00.480 --> 00:25:00.980
Good.

00:25:00.980 --> 00:25:02.100
What else did you notice?

00:25:02.100 --> 00:25:04.184
And by the way, we're all
the same in this regard.

00:25:04.184 --> 00:25:05.766
Even though we're
all different, we're

00:25:05.766 --> 00:25:08.710
the same in that we're concerned
about similar kinds of things

00:25:08.710 --> 00:25:10.320
from this point of view.

00:25:10.320 --> 00:25:10.820
Please.

00:25:10.820 --> 00:25:12.131
AUDIENCE: Physical sensations?

00:25:12.131 --> 00:25:14.380
DIANE MUSHO HAMILTON: Totally
aware of my body, right?

00:25:14.380 --> 00:25:16.950
I'm aware when I feel
comfortable or uncomfortable.

00:25:16.950 --> 00:25:19.040
I can feel anxiety in the body.

00:25:19.040 --> 00:25:20.770
I feel sensations of pleasure.

00:25:20.770 --> 00:25:22.740
And I also have a
very strong sense

00:25:22.740 --> 00:25:25.795
of where I end and
everything else begins.

00:25:25.795 --> 00:25:27.420
You can have an
experience when someone

00:25:27.420 --> 00:25:29.590
crosses your boundaries,
for instance.

00:25:29.590 --> 00:25:31.860
And you just feel
that, like, ooh,

00:25:31.860 --> 00:25:33.160
that didn't feel good to me.

00:25:33.160 --> 00:25:35.760
Or somebody says something that
feels aggressive in a meeting.

00:25:35.760 --> 00:25:38.880
You're like, oh, I
feel offended by that.

00:25:38.880 --> 00:25:40.060
What else do you notice?

00:25:40.060 --> 00:25:40.560
Yeah.

00:25:40.560 --> 00:25:42.519
AUDIENCE: I'm watching,
or I'm paying attention

00:25:42.519 --> 00:25:44.059
to what I'm getting
out of this talk,

00:25:44.059 --> 00:25:46.040
and I'm evaluating
you as a presenter.

00:25:46.040 --> 00:25:46.790
DIANE MUSHO HAMILTON: Damn it.

00:25:46.790 --> 00:25:47.706
Did you hear what he--

00:25:47.706 --> 00:25:49.390
[LAUGHTER]

00:25:49.390 --> 00:25:49.890
Right.

00:25:49.890 --> 00:25:52.120
So wherever there's
an egocentric self,

00:25:52.120 --> 00:25:55.670
there's a sense of the other,
so there's self and other.

00:25:55.670 --> 00:25:56.920
So I am here.

00:25:56.920 --> 00:25:58.410
I'm here to receive something.

00:25:58.410 --> 00:26:00.320
I'm evaluating you
as the presenter

00:26:00.320 --> 00:26:02.020
and whether or not
what you're doing

00:26:02.020 --> 00:26:03.240
is actually valuable to me.

00:26:03.240 --> 00:26:05.550
And that's an evaluation
that's happening all the time.

00:26:05.550 --> 00:26:06.130
Great.

00:26:06.130 --> 00:26:06.630
Good.

00:26:06.630 --> 00:26:09.240
What other things do you notice?

00:26:09.240 --> 00:26:11.794
Any egos feel stressed out?

00:26:11.794 --> 00:26:12.610
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

00:26:12.610 --> 00:26:13.735
DIANE MUSHO HAMILTON: Yeah?

00:26:13.735 --> 00:26:14.530
Say more, yeah.

00:26:14.530 --> 00:26:15.793
How are you stressed out?

00:26:15.793 --> 00:26:16.751
AUDIENCE: Next meeting.

00:26:16.751 --> 00:26:17.713
Need to get ready.

00:26:17.713 --> 00:26:18.836
Probably [INAUDIBLE].

00:26:18.836 --> 00:26:19.960
DIANE MUSHO HAMILTON: Yeah.

00:26:19.960 --> 00:26:21.950
Have to duck out a
little bit early?

00:26:21.950 --> 00:26:22.730
OK, good.

00:26:22.730 --> 00:26:25.800
So one of the conditions
that we want to pay attention

00:26:25.800 --> 00:26:28.810
to whenever we're
identifying as the ego

00:26:28.810 --> 00:26:31.450
is that there's a
sense of separation.

00:26:31.450 --> 00:26:35.310
And because there's a sense
of separation, there's stress.

00:26:35.310 --> 00:26:37.380
That is just the
fundamental situation,

00:26:37.380 --> 00:26:39.940
is that we're always kind
of maintaining our image.

00:26:39.940 --> 00:26:41.832
We're maintaining
our sense of safety.

00:26:41.832 --> 00:26:43.540
We're maintaining our
sense of belonging.

00:26:43.540 --> 00:26:45.660
So there's a constant
sense when I'm

00:26:45.660 --> 00:26:48.660
identified that I have to
actually take care of that.

00:26:48.660 --> 00:26:52.220
Now when you lose that
identification in a project,

00:26:52.220 --> 00:26:54.960
or in a piece of music,
or you enter a flow state,

00:26:54.960 --> 00:26:58.280
or you go to the gym, and you're
just basically washing yourself

00:26:58.280 --> 00:27:03.400
in serotonin or dopamine, then
that sense of self dissolves,

00:27:03.400 --> 00:27:05.610
and you don't feel
that stress anymore.

00:27:05.610 --> 00:27:07.750
So there's almost
always, whenever

00:27:07.750 --> 00:27:10.480
we're identified as
an ego, almost always

00:27:10.480 --> 00:27:12.420
there's a situation of stress.

00:27:12.420 --> 00:27:13.740
Does that make sense to you?

00:27:13.740 --> 00:27:14.431
OK, cool.

00:27:14.431 --> 00:27:14.930
All right.

00:27:14.930 --> 00:27:16.900
So we're going to
grow our perspectives.

00:27:16.900 --> 00:27:18.580
Are you ready?

00:27:18.580 --> 00:27:23.090
So where do you think we
naturally grow, from the self

00:27:23.090 --> 00:27:27.100
to the-- to our group.

00:27:27.100 --> 00:27:27.700
Right?

00:27:27.700 --> 00:27:28.500
To our group.

00:27:28.500 --> 00:27:30.650
So what we're going
to do in this round

00:27:30.650 --> 00:27:32.260
is I'm going to
ask you to identify

00:27:32.260 --> 00:27:34.950
as the ethnocentric self.

00:27:34.950 --> 00:27:37.620
Now this can be really tricky,
because if the ego feels

00:27:37.620 --> 00:27:41.170
stressed, the ethnocentric
self feels safe in my group,

00:27:41.170 --> 00:27:44.230
but your group can sometimes
feel threatening to me.

00:27:44.230 --> 00:27:45.910
Do you get what
I'm talking about?

00:27:45.910 --> 00:27:47.326
So what I'm going
to ask you to do

00:27:47.326 --> 00:27:50.840
is identify with the
groups of your upbringing,

00:27:50.840 --> 00:27:52.260
like where you grew up.

00:27:52.260 --> 00:27:54.527
So as the ethnocentric
self, let's do it.

00:27:54.527 --> 00:27:56.610
Let's the four of us just
model this for a moment.

00:27:56.610 --> 00:27:59.740
So as the ethnocentric self, I
grew up in the desert of Utah,

00:27:59.740 --> 00:28:01.820
and I spent a lot
of time in nature.

00:28:01.820 --> 00:28:05.730
And I can say negative
things about my brothers,

00:28:05.730 --> 00:28:07.700
but don't you.

00:28:07.700 --> 00:28:11.430
Do you see that boundary around
the people that I grew up with?

00:28:11.430 --> 00:28:12.480
So go ahead, Adam.

00:28:12.480 --> 00:28:16.730
ADAM LEONARD: So I grew
up in Madison, Wisconsin,

00:28:16.730 --> 00:28:18.980
and so identified more with
the Midwest in that sense.

00:28:18.980 --> 00:28:20.271
DIANE MUSHO HAMILTON: OK, good.

00:28:20.271 --> 00:28:21.920
So what were some
values in the Midwest

00:28:21.920 --> 00:28:23.310
as your ethnocentric self?

00:28:23.310 --> 00:28:25.390
What did all your
people agree to?

00:28:25.390 --> 00:28:27.350
ADAM LEONARD: Mhm.

00:28:27.350 --> 00:28:28.400
Agreements?

00:28:28.400 --> 00:28:31.110
There was kind of an
easy-goingness and niceness.

00:28:31.110 --> 00:28:33.080
DIANE MUSHO HAMILTON:
We like to be nice.

00:28:33.080 --> 00:28:34.770
If I'm from the
Midwest, we're nice.

00:28:34.770 --> 00:28:35.610
OK, people?

00:28:35.610 --> 00:28:37.070
You're mean-- we're not.

00:28:37.070 --> 00:28:38.360
OK, good.

00:28:38.360 --> 00:28:39.712
OK?

00:28:39.712 --> 00:28:42.780
AUDIENCE: As the ethnocentric
self growing up in Canada,

00:28:42.780 --> 00:28:45.004
I would say we were
nicer than you,

00:28:45.004 --> 00:28:46.170
but we would never say that.

00:28:46.170 --> 00:28:47.770
[LAUGHTER]

00:28:47.770 --> 00:28:49.640
DIANE MUSHO HAMILTON:
So as a Canadian,

00:28:49.640 --> 00:28:52.746
we're nicer than Midwesterners,
and we wouldn't say it.

00:28:52.746 --> 00:28:53.474
Hello.

00:28:53.474 --> 00:28:54.140
All right, good.

00:28:54.140 --> 00:28:55.256
Go ahead.

00:28:55.256 --> 00:28:58.040
AUDIENCE: I grew up
in Montreal, Canada,

00:28:58.040 --> 00:29:00.370
in a French and
English community.

00:29:00.370 --> 00:29:02.000
So there was a
very clear division

00:29:02.000 --> 00:29:05.550
between the English, who
were also Protestant,

00:29:05.550 --> 00:29:07.170
and the French,
who were Catholic.

00:29:07.170 --> 00:29:10.160
So we passed each other on
opposite sides of the street

00:29:10.160 --> 00:29:12.050
going to school,
going to church,

00:29:12.050 --> 00:29:13.680
where we shopped for groceries.

00:29:13.680 --> 00:29:14.470
Very divided.

00:29:14.470 --> 00:29:15.636
DIANE MUSHO HAMILTON: Great.

00:29:15.636 --> 00:29:19.180
So notice your identity grow
and notice yourself belong.

00:29:19.180 --> 00:29:22.140
Now some of you may not be
able to connect very well

00:29:22.140 --> 00:29:23.830
to the place you came from.

00:29:23.830 --> 00:29:25.242
But just do it for fun.

00:29:25.242 --> 00:29:26.700
And then I'll help
you a little bit

00:29:26.700 --> 00:29:28.910
with why it could
be useful to you

00:29:28.910 --> 00:29:31.430
to integrate that part
of yourself a little bit.

00:29:31.430 --> 00:29:31.930
OK.

00:29:31.930 --> 00:29:35.400
So the sentence is, as the
ethnocentric self, here's

00:29:35.400 --> 00:29:36.540
what I notice.

00:29:36.540 --> 00:29:37.182
OK?

00:29:37.182 --> 00:29:38.140
Two and a half minutes.

00:29:38.140 --> 00:29:40.940
Go ahead.

[INTERPOSING VOICES]

00:29:56.220 --> 00:29:58.650
Were you able to kind
of expand your identity

00:29:58.650 --> 00:30:00.265
to include your group?

00:30:00.265 --> 00:30:00.890
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

DIANE MUSHO HAMILTON: Yeah?

00:30:01.370 --> 00:30:01.870
Good.

00:30:01.870 --> 00:30:04.650
And what did you notice about
expanding your identity?

00:30:04.650 --> 00:30:06.590
What things came into
your mind, let's say,

00:30:06.590 --> 00:30:09.280
that weren't there when you
were just identified as the ego?

00:30:09.280 --> 00:30:10.370
What did you notice?

00:30:10.370 --> 00:30:11.246
AUDIENCE: Had values.

00:30:11.246 --> 00:30:12.745
DIANE MUSHO HAMILTON:
I have values.

00:30:12.745 --> 00:30:13.650
Absolutely.

00:30:13.650 --> 00:30:15.960
And the values were
the ones of the people,

00:30:15.960 --> 00:30:17.720
my tribe, the people
I belonged with.

00:30:17.720 --> 00:30:18.570
Very good.

00:30:18.570 --> 00:30:19.926
What else did you notice?

AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:30:24.167 --> 00:30:25.250
DIANE MUSHO HAMILTON: Yes.

00:30:25.250 --> 00:30:29.250
We come from different countries
with opposite sensations--

00:30:29.250 --> 00:30:32.534
I mean, opposite qualities.

00:30:32.534 --> 00:30:34.700
And there were things that
we actually agreed about.

00:30:34.700 --> 00:30:36.290
So in a way, what
you're already doing

00:30:36.290 --> 00:30:38.920
is anticipating the
world-centric step.

00:30:38.920 --> 00:30:40.540
Because my guess
is there are people

00:30:40.540 --> 00:30:43.810
from all of your
hometowns who don't

00:30:43.810 --> 00:30:46.506
move to a world-centric
level very easily.

00:30:46.506 --> 00:30:47.380
Does that make sense?

00:30:47.380 --> 00:30:49.050
Like, they're very
deeply embedded

00:30:49.050 --> 00:30:52.080
in the ethos of
what you grew up in.

00:30:52.080 --> 00:30:55.370
And the other is still
an other to them.

00:30:55.370 --> 00:30:55.870
Right?

00:30:55.870 --> 00:30:56.830
Does that make sense?

00:30:56.830 --> 00:30:59.560
So whereas the ego,
there's self and other,

00:30:59.560 --> 00:31:01.650
at the ethnocentric
level of development,

00:31:01.650 --> 00:31:03.734
what is there, very strongly?

00:31:03.734 --> 00:31:04.650
AUDIENCE: Us and them?

00:31:04.650 --> 00:31:06.250
DIANE MUSHO HAMILTON:
Us and them.

00:31:06.250 --> 00:31:06.750
Us and them.

00:31:06.750 --> 00:31:07.700
It's really strong.

00:31:07.700 --> 00:31:10.700
So if you can cross that
barrier of us and them,

00:31:10.700 --> 00:31:12.605
you're already
established at what

00:31:12.605 --> 00:31:14.730
we would call a world-centric
level of development.

00:31:14.730 --> 00:31:17.020
We'll explore that
in just a moment.

00:31:17.020 --> 00:31:18.690
So what else about
ethnocentrism?

00:31:18.690 --> 00:31:21.130
Did anybody feel some
sense of belonging?

00:31:21.130 --> 00:31:22.690
Like, you felt
safe in your group?

00:31:22.690 --> 00:31:22.940
Yeah.

00:31:22.940 --> 00:31:23.490
Say something.

00:31:23.490 --> 00:31:24.710
AUDIENCE: I was going to
say that very same thing.

00:31:24.710 --> 00:31:25.535
[INAUDIBLE] us and them.

00:31:25.535 --> 00:31:26.380
DIANE MUSHO HAMILTON: Totally.

00:31:26.380 --> 00:31:28.270
In fact, here's something
for you to try on.

00:31:28.270 --> 00:31:30.010
I don't know if this
makes sense to you.

00:31:30.010 --> 00:31:33.130
So guess what often
drives development?

00:31:33.130 --> 00:31:35.450
Guess why we actually
grow in our identity,

00:31:35.450 --> 00:31:37.770
or why we take on
more perspectives?

00:31:37.770 --> 00:31:39.640
We call it the shadow.

00:31:39.640 --> 00:31:44.069
Because I start to see that
this little point of view is,

00:31:44.069 --> 00:31:46.610
what were some of the dark sides
that you were talking about?

00:31:46.610 --> 00:31:49.137
AUDIENCE: Exclusionary type
of thinking and thinking

00:31:49.137 --> 00:31:49.970
that you're special.

00:31:49.970 --> 00:31:55.580
DIANE MUSHO HAMILTON: Too much
prejudice, too much homophobia,

00:31:55.580 --> 00:31:59.240
too much arrogance, too much
our way is the only way.

00:31:59.240 --> 00:32:01.310
That starts to feel too tight.

00:32:01.310 --> 00:32:04.126
Like, I can't just live
in that-- you know,

00:32:04.126 --> 00:32:06.550
it's like I really feel
safe, and I feel comfortable,

00:32:06.550 --> 00:32:07.260
and I'm at home.

00:32:07.260 --> 00:32:10.120
But there's just something
over the next horizon

00:32:10.120 --> 00:32:12.860
that I feel I want to
step into because this

00:32:12.860 --> 00:32:14.710
starts to feel too small.

00:32:14.710 --> 00:32:18.340
In the same way the ego is too
small, then all of a sudden, so

00:32:18.340 --> 00:32:20.010
is my ethnocentric identity.

00:32:20.010 --> 00:32:21.414
It's just too small.

00:32:21.414 --> 00:32:22.330
Does that makes sense?

00:32:22.330 --> 00:32:24.770
Or maybe I traveled, and I
had another point of view.

00:32:24.770 --> 00:32:26.080
Or maybe I immigrated.

00:32:26.080 --> 00:32:27.800
Or maybe somebody
immigrated who's

00:32:27.800 --> 00:32:31.230
living next to me, and now all
of a sudden that little secure

00:32:31.230 --> 00:32:33.440
sense I have about
how the world is,

00:32:33.440 --> 00:32:36.490
suddenly I start to feel
like, oh, there's difference.

00:32:36.490 --> 00:32:38.670
And guess what the bright
line in development

00:32:38.670 --> 00:32:41.330
is between ethnocentrism
and world-centrism?

00:32:41.330 --> 00:32:42.240
Guess what it is?

00:32:42.240 --> 00:32:44.802
There are a few, but there's
one really significant one.

00:32:44.802 --> 00:32:46.166
AUDIENCE: Contact.

00:32:46.166 --> 00:32:47.540
DIANE MUSHO
HAMILTON: Difference.

00:32:47.540 --> 00:32:49.810
At world-centric,
difference is embraced.

00:32:49.810 --> 00:32:53.130
At ethnocentric,
difference is threatening.

00:32:53.130 --> 00:32:55.570
Does everybody see that?

00:32:55.570 --> 00:32:59.770
So you can almost-- it
would be inaccurate to do,

00:32:59.770 --> 00:33:04.000
but you can almost kind of
feel a culture, in terms

00:33:04.000 --> 00:33:06.780
of how many perspectives
this can take,

00:33:06.780 --> 00:33:09.030
on what its relationship
to diversity is.

00:33:09.030 --> 00:33:10.830
Does that make sense?

00:33:10.830 --> 00:33:11.330
Yeah?

00:33:11.330 --> 00:33:12.955
AUDIENCE: What did
you mean by the term

00:33:12.955 --> 00:33:15.194
"shadow," in terms
of the ethnocentric?

00:33:15.194 --> 00:33:18.800
DIANE MUSHO HAMILTON: So in
order to maintain an identity,

00:33:18.800 --> 00:33:21.920
there are things that I
have to keep out of it.

00:33:21.920 --> 00:33:23.230
Does that make sense?

00:33:23.230 --> 00:33:27.350
So Jung referred to the shadow
as anything that I cannot bring

00:33:27.350 --> 00:33:29.930
into my identity as me.

00:33:29.930 --> 00:33:33.730
So I used to do lots of
conversations on race.

00:33:33.730 --> 00:33:37.460
Race and race
relations, just issues

00:33:37.460 --> 00:33:39.280
related to ethnic identity.

00:33:39.280 --> 00:33:43.730
And when the identity is
strong, necessarily there

00:33:43.730 --> 00:33:46.460
are things that are
left outside of it.

00:33:46.460 --> 00:33:49.280
So as Diane, I'm
doing a mediation.

00:33:49.280 --> 00:33:50.630
A woman gets upset.

00:33:50.630 --> 00:33:52.370
She tells me that
she's upset with me

00:33:52.370 --> 00:33:54.760
because I'm flirting
with her husband.

00:33:54.760 --> 00:33:57.500
And what is my first response?

00:33:57.500 --> 00:34:00.050
I'm not a flirt.

00:34:00.050 --> 00:34:01.550
I would never do that, right?

00:34:01.550 --> 00:34:02.520
Not me.

00:34:02.520 --> 00:34:04.030
It's the not me.

00:34:04.030 --> 00:34:07.299
So what happens is the
not me starts to encroach.

00:34:07.299 --> 00:34:09.840
The not me start-- and you start
saying, well, wait a minute.

00:34:09.840 --> 00:34:11.730
Is that really not me?

00:34:11.730 --> 00:34:14.500
Maybe there's more of me
than I thought there was.

00:34:14.500 --> 00:34:16.080
Maybe I am a flirt.

00:34:16.080 --> 00:34:16.850
You're right.

00:34:16.850 --> 00:34:17.380
It's true.

00:34:17.380 --> 00:34:19.460
I want to marry your
soon-to-be ex-husband.

00:34:19.460 --> 00:34:22.892
No, that's not [INAUDIBLE].

00:34:22.892 --> 00:34:24.600
I said, you're the
fool that married him,

00:34:24.600 --> 00:34:26.224
and now I have to
mediate your divorce.

00:34:26.224 --> 00:34:28.789
Leave me alone.

00:34:28.789 --> 00:34:30.330
But it's just
basically anything that

00:34:30.330 --> 00:34:33.590
comes in that we can't
hold as I. It's not me.

00:34:33.590 --> 00:34:36.159
It's a very famous thing
that we say that when

00:34:36.159 --> 00:34:38.080
human beings go to
war with each other,

00:34:38.080 --> 00:34:41.380
that one of the first things
we do is dehumanize the enemy.

00:34:41.380 --> 00:34:43.650
Because the enemy
has to become not me.

00:34:43.650 --> 00:34:45.530
If it's not me, then
I can abuse you.

00:34:45.530 --> 00:34:46.290
I can kill you.

00:34:46.290 --> 00:34:47.429
I can destroy you.

00:34:47.429 --> 00:34:51.510
But as soon as you're like
me, I no longer can do that.

00:34:51.510 --> 00:34:53.570
So that boundary
around what's me

00:34:53.570 --> 00:34:57.720
and what's not me at
ethnocentric is strong.

00:34:57.720 --> 00:35:02.430
And it can be kind of
confusing to suddenly start

00:35:02.430 --> 00:35:04.330
to want to move,
or naturally move,

00:35:04.330 --> 00:35:06.290
to a world-centric
level of development,

00:35:06.290 --> 00:35:08.870
because you don't want
to necessarily push away

00:35:08.870 --> 00:35:09.540
your culture.

00:35:09.540 --> 00:35:11.429
But you don't
quite-- it's awkward.

00:35:11.429 --> 00:35:12.720
Have any of you ever felt that?

00:35:12.720 --> 00:35:15.096
Like, there's an awkwardness
in terms of that transition?

00:35:15.096 --> 00:35:16.553
And I'll tell you
a little bit more

00:35:16.553 --> 00:35:18.900
about that in just a moment
and how to work with that.

00:35:18.900 --> 00:35:22.290
So the shadow is really
the pressing in of things

00:35:22.290 --> 00:35:23.840
that we don't want to be me.

00:35:23.840 --> 00:35:26.700
So another example
would be, it might

00:35:26.700 --> 00:35:34.780
be that, traditionally,
being gay is not me, right?

00:35:34.780 --> 00:35:38.050
And then all of a
sudden, my brother's gay.

00:35:38.050 --> 00:35:40.170
And all of a sudden, my son is.

00:35:40.170 --> 00:35:43.240
And all of a sudden, all
the not me is now me.

00:35:43.240 --> 00:35:46.200
But the culture I'm in is
still saying it's not me.

00:35:46.200 --> 00:35:49.141
That's an interesting way
just to think about it.

00:35:49.141 --> 00:35:49.640
All right.

00:35:49.640 --> 00:35:51.650
So do you want to grow
now in your perspective,

00:35:51.650 --> 00:35:53.210
just get a little bit bigger?

00:35:53.210 --> 00:35:55.590
So this round, you're
going to identify

00:35:55.590 --> 00:35:58.430
as the world-centric self.

00:35:58.430 --> 00:35:59.930
And you're going
to feel, well, what

00:35:59.930 --> 00:36:01.880
does it mean to
be world-centric?

00:36:01.880 --> 00:36:04.810
In fact, we were down
in the juice bar,

00:36:04.810 --> 00:36:08.870
in the Wellness Center, and
I got a nice cup of juice.

00:36:08.870 --> 00:36:13.910
And guess what the name of the
label on the plastic cup was?

00:36:13.910 --> 00:36:15.195
World-centric.

00:36:15.195 --> 00:36:17.320
That's what it said.

00:36:17.320 --> 00:36:19.850
So you can identify as
the world-centric self

00:36:19.850 --> 00:36:21.760
and see what comes
into awareness.

00:36:21.760 --> 00:36:25.230
Just identify and let your
awareness do the work.

00:36:25.230 --> 00:36:27.242
What does it mean
to be world-centric?

00:36:27.242 --> 00:36:28.200
Two and a half minutes.

00:36:28.200 --> 00:36:28.908
Let's explore it.

00:36:28.908 --> 00:36:32.278
[INTERPOSING VOICES]

00:36:44.660 --> 00:36:49.370
So just as an interesting
form of exploration,

00:36:49.370 --> 00:36:52.100
as you identified as
the world-centric self,

00:36:52.100 --> 00:36:55.240
what came into awareness that
wasn't there when you were

00:36:55.240 --> 00:36:56.984
at an ethnocentric--
when you had

00:36:56.984 --> 00:36:58.150
another set of perspectives?

00:36:58.150 --> 00:37:00.950
What perspectives
suddenly came online?

00:37:00.950 --> 00:37:03.900
How about you guys in the back?

00:37:03.900 --> 00:37:05.300
Yeah?

00:37:05.300 --> 00:37:06.830
AUDIENCE: Scale.

00:37:06.830 --> 00:37:11.018
Often enough, I kind
of go back and forth

00:37:11.018 --> 00:37:14.477
between ego and ethno
[INAUDIBLE] communal, but not

00:37:14.477 --> 00:37:15.210
world.

00:37:15.210 --> 00:37:17.150
DIANE MUSHO HAMILTON:
Right, right, right.

00:37:17.150 --> 00:37:17.650
Yeah.

00:37:17.650 --> 00:37:19.870
And yet I think it's
fair to say Google

00:37:19.870 --> 00:37:23.260
is a world-centric company,
in terms of its reach.

00:37:23.260 --> 00:37:24.394
Is that fair?

00:37:24.394 --> 00:37:25.170
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

00:37:25.170 --> 00:37:26.020
DIANE MUSHO HAMILTON:
Yeah, I think so.

00:37:26.020 --> 00:37:26.520
Yeah?

00:37:26.520 --> 00:37:28.380
AUDIENCE: Well, in
my case, I feel--

00:37:28.380 --> 00:37:29.713
DIANE MUSHO HAMILTON: Very good.

00:37:29.713 --> 00:37:33.380
So actually, my capacity to
identify with all of humanity

00:37:33.380 --> 00:37:35.410
and to really enjoy
the differences

00:37:35.410 --> 00:37:38.300
and to appreciate the
differences is fully online.

00:37:38.300 --> 00:37:40.540
One of the dilemmas
of being world-centric

00:37:40.540 --> 00:37:43.600
is that when you try to
speak world-centric language

00:37:43.600 --> 00:37:47.080
to people who are genuinely
embedded at ethnocentric,

00:37:47.080 --> 00:37:48.850
it's a developmental thing.

00:37:48.850 --> 00:37:49.940
It's not a moral thing.

00:37:49.940 --> 00:37:51.565
It's like telling a
toddler they should

00:37:51.565 --> 00:37:53.340
be able to run
better than they are.

00:37:53.340 --> 00:37:55.530
Now you have to kind of
try that on a little.

00:37:55.530 --> 00:37:57.070
Again, think about atoms.

00:37:57.070 --> 00:38:01.220
Think about complexity more than
about dominator hierarchies.

00:38:01.220 --> 00:38:03.000
But it is true that
what can happen

00:38:03.000 --> 00:38:06.420
is you are filled with this
expansive sense of look

00:38:06.420 --> 00:38:09.730
at-- identify with the
ecosystems and lots of species

00:38:09.730 --> 00:38:11.460
and what's happening
around the planet.

00:38:11.460 --> 00:38:13.450
And I want you to do the same.

00:38:13.450 --> 00:38:16.690
And when you don't, I overbear
on you in that kind of way,

00:38:16.690 --> 00:38:20.510
where then I become sort of
bigoted in a world-centric way.

00:38:20.510 --> 00:38:23.690
It's like I'm bigoted, but
with my own set of values.

00:38:23.690 --> 00:38:25.910
Is that resonating with people?

00:38:25.910 --> 00:38:27.950
That's one of the
tricky parts of it.

00:38:27.950 --> 00:38:30.260
Now, it is possible
when you start

00:38:30.260 --> 00:38:31.910
to look at these,
how does somebody

00:38:31.910 --> 00:38:33.090
work with perspectives?

00:38:33.090 --> 00:38:36.480
How many perspectives are
available in this conversation?

00:38:36.480 --> 00:38:39.520
You can sort of start to go,
like, how many perspectives can

00:38:39.520 --> 00:38:40.420
we get on the table?

00:38:40.420 --> 00:38:42.610
And we'll maybe go to the
limit of what's possible.

00:38:42.610 --> 00:38:45.010
And then kind of adapt
to working with that,

00:38:45.010 --> 00:38:48.610
instead of pressuring people
to take on perspectives they

00:38:48.610 --> 00:38:49.570
literally can't.

00:38:49.570 --> 00:38:53.000
They literally don't
come up, so to speak.

00:38:53.000 --> 00:38:55.850
And one of the questions
that psychologists

00:38:55.850 --> 00:38:58.420
are working with is,
why is it that people

00:38:58.420 --> 00:39:01.470
move to a world-centric
level, and why don't they?

00:39:01.470 --> 00:39:04.150
And why is it that 70%
of the world's population

00:39:04.150 --> 00:39:06.435
seems to be at more of
an ethnocentric level

00:39:06.435 --> 00:39:07.140
of development?

00:39:07.140 --> 00:39:09.181
In other words, a whole
other set of perspectives

00:39:09.181 --> 00:39:10.460
are not really online.

00:39:10.460 --> 00:39:13.450
And how can we include
that without devaluing it?

00:39:13.450 --> 00:39:18.600
Like, do we have to jettison
the whole developmental lens

00:39:18.600 --> 00:39:20.880
in order to treat
everyone equally?

00:39:20.880 --> 00:39:24.180
So there's this real kind of
complex developmental challenge

00:39:24.180 --> 00:39:26.600
that's in this body of work.

00:39:26.600 --> 00:39:29.480
And when I go back to
revisiting the naive mediator,

00:39:29.480 --> 00:39:31.759
she just wants everyone to
be the same and be equal.

00:39:31.759 --> 00:39:33.300
But she has to be
honest with herself

00:39:33.300 --> 00:39:36.480
that the capacity for taking
perspectives is not the same

00:39:36.480 --> 00:39:39.420
and that she's kind of up in the
night if she doesn't know that.

00:39:39.420 --> 00:39:41.200
Does that answer your question?

00:39:41.200 --> 00:39:43.250
If you'll bear with
me for a moment,

00:39:43.250 --> 00:39:47.622
I'm going to make an
assumption that the overriding

00:39:47.622 --> 00:39:49.080
number of people
at Google are sort

00:39:49.080 --> 00:39:50.770
of ethnocentric in
their sensibilities.

00:39:50.770 --> 00:39:51.326
Is that fair?

00:39:51.326 --> 00:39:53.700
In other words, you can take
an egocentric point of view,

00:39:53.700 --> 00:39:56.241
an ethnocentric point of view,
a world-centric point of view.

00:39:56.241 --> 00:39:59.770
And then you can
identify as a Googler.

00:39:59.770 --> 00:40:03.220
And as a Googler, is that
an ethnocentric identity?

00:40:03.220 --> 00:40:05.316
AUDIENCE: Yes.

00:40:05.316 --> 00:40:06.440
DIANE MUSHO HAMILTON: Yeah.

00:40:06.440 --> 00:40:08.064
Well, that's what's
interesting, right?

00:40:08.064 --> 00:40:11.020
Because it has the qualities
of, well, this is my company,

00:40:11.020 --> 00:40:12.330
and I'm not that company.

00:40:12.330 --> 00:40:14.290
Or this is the
lifestyle I prefer.

00:40:14.290 --> 00:40:17.950
And then it has all the traits
of more of ethnocentrism.

00:40:17.950 --> 00:40:19.830
It doesn't have
the expansiveness

00:40:19.830 --> 00:40:22.350
that a genuine world-centric
perspective has.

00:40:22.350 --> 00:40:24.620
So in a way, what I
would invite you to do

00:40:24.620 --> 00:40:27.120
is just work with this
as a very loose framework

00:40:27.120 --> 00:40:29.810
to help you make some
distinctions but at no point

00:40:29.810 --> 00:40:31.680
regard this as truth.

00:40:31.680 --> 00:40:34.140
Because that starts to
limit, actually, the nuance

00:40:34.140 --> 00:40:37.010
and just the open
question that we

00:40:37.010 --> 00:40:40.570
have about how are
perspectives at play.

00:40:40.570 --> 00:40:43.777
So would you like to
go one more level?

00:40:43.777 --> 00:40:45.360
So I'm going to lead
you through this.

00:40:45.360 --> 00:40:47.244
I'm not going to have
you talk to each other.

00:40:47.244 --> 00:40:48.660
But I'm going to
actually lead it,

00:40:48.660 --> 00:40:51.850
and I'm going to touch into a
quality of mind and identity

00:40:51.850 --> 00:40:53.814
that maybe I'm going
to put a label on,

00:40:53.814 --> 00:40:54.980
and then we'll work with it.

00:40:54.980 --> 00:40:57.040
So what I'd like
you do is I'd like

00:40:57.040 --> 00:41:01.150
you to identify as the
cosmic-centric self.

00:41:01.150 --> 00:41:03.670
We're going to actually
transcend world-centric,

00:41:03.670 --> 00:41:07.330
and you're going to
become cosmic-centric.

00:41:07.330 --> 00:41:10.640
Now keep in mind,
cosmic-centric includes world.

00:41:10.640 --> 00:41:12.410
It includes healthy
ethnocentrism--

00:41:12.410 --> 00:41:16.400
healthy-- and
healthy egocentric.

00:41:16.400 --> 00:41:17.580
So who am I speaking to?

00:41:17.580 --> 00:41:19.119
Who are you?

00:41:19.119 --> 00:41:20.160
AUDIENCE: Cosmic-centric.

00:41:20.160 --> 00:41:22.243
DIANE MUSHO HAMILTON: I'm
the cosmic-centric self.

00:41:22.243 --> 00:41:24.450
So just identify as the
cosmic-centric self.

00:41:24.450 --> 00:41:26.660
And can I ask you a question?

00:41:26.660 --> 00:41:31.620
As the cosmic-centric
self, how big are you?

00:41:31.620 --> 00:41:34.380
Where is that
boundary of identity?

00:41:34.380 --> 00:41:37.070
You're limitless.

00:41:37.070 --> 00:41:38.260
So you said limitless.

00:41:38.260 --> 00:41:38.870
Anyone else?

00:41:38.870 --> 00:41:39.620
AUDIENCE: Endless.

00:41:39.620 --> 00:41:41.578
DIANE MUSHO HAMILTON:
"Endless" is a good word.

00:41:41.578 --> 00:41:42.900
"Vast" is a good word.

00:41:42.900 --> 00:41:44.170
Just, whoa!

00:41:44.170 --> 00:41:47.900
But keep in mind, to the ego,
that feels very overwhelming.

00:41:47.900 --> 00:41:52.030
Because the ego
wants its boundaries.

00:41:52.030 --> 00:41:52.530
All right.

00:41:52.530 --> 00:41:57.010
So as the cosmic-centric
self, when were you born?

00:41:57.010 --> 00:41:59.240
13-- you guys keep
changing the number.

00:41:59.240 --> 00:42:03.460
13.5, 13.7, 13.8.

00:42:03.460 --> 00:42:05.860
Could you even say-- and
this is for you-- could

00:42:05.860 --> 00:42:08.020
you even say if we
just looked at space,

00:42:08.020 --> 00:42:13.370
and we said, I'm
limitless space actually--

00:42:13.370 --> 00:42:16.120
I can't quite identify
the boundaries of space.

00:42:16.120 --> 00:42:19.210
Can I also, as the
cosmic-centric self,

00:42:19.210 --> 00:42:21.931
feel beyond time?

00:42:21.931 --> 00:42:23.290
Yeah, can you feel that?

00:42:23.290 --> 00:42:24.420
Yeah.

00:42:24.420 --> 00:42:25.050
Good.

00:42:25.050 --> 00:42:26.340
AUDIENCE: I just want
to say, I feel like,

00:42:26.340 --> 00:42:27.200
as the cosmic-centric--

00:42:27.200 --> 00:42:27.920
DIANE MUSHO HAMILTON: OK.

00:42:27.920 --> 00:42:29.680
He says, as the
cosmic-centric self,

00:42:29.680 --> 00:42:31.940
because I let down
my boundaries,

00:42:31.940 --> 00:42:33.960
I feel connected
with everything.

00:42:33.960 --> 00:42:35.880
And I notice there's
a sense of happiness.

00:42:35.880 --> 00:42:38.250
Nothing really feels
threatening to me.

00:42:38.250 --> 00:42:41.080
It's because identity
itself has dissolved.

00:42:41.080 --> 00:42:44.720
And when identity itself
dissolves, I'm completely open.

00:42:44.720 --> 00:42:48.720
And I'm relaxed in a way
that's really fundamental.

00:42:48.720 --> 00:42:50.930
I feel really at home.

00:42:50.930 --> 00:42:53.880
What is the practice
that we use to cultivate

00:42:53.880 --> 00:42:56.000
this quality of awareness?

00:42:56.000 --> 00:42:57.660
Meditation.

00:42:57.660 --> 00:43:00.440
So we don't give it that label,
because that label creates

00:43:00.440 --> 00:43:00.940
something.

00:43:00.940 --> 00:43:05.230
We actually just continually
drop identification.

00:43:05.230 --> 00:43:08.980
So as the cosmic-centric self,
what are your preferences?

00:43:08.980 --> 00:43:10.934
What do you prefer?

00:43:10.934 --> 00:43:12.350
AUDIENCE: Whatever happens.

00:43:12.350 --> 00:43:15.920
DIANE MUSHO HAMILTON: I
prefer whatever's happening.

00:43:15.920 --> 00:43:18.720
That's awesome.

00:43:18.720 --> 00:43:20.825
Thich Nhat Hanh would be
very proud of this group

00:43:20.825 --> 00:43:23.930
if he were here right now.

00:43:23.930 --> 00:43:24.430
Yeah.

00:43:24.430 --> 00:43:25.301
Please.

00:43:25.301 --> 00:43:27.947
AUDIENCE: Present moment
awareness and objectivity.

00:43:27.947 --> 00:43:30.390
DIANE MUSHO HAMILTON:
So because time changes,

00:43:30.390 --> 00:43:33.170
I no longer am referencing
past and future.

00:43:33.170 --> 00:43:36.170
I'm completely in the
here and now, right?

00:43:36.170 --> 00:43:38.190
And my awareness is wide open.

00:43:38.190 --> 00:43:39.540
There's no sense of limit.

00:43:39.540 --> 00:43:44.260
I'm not organizing awareness
around me or around you and not

00:43:44.260 --> 00:43:45.220
you, right?

00:43:45.220 --> 00:43:46.980
But my awareness
is just wide open,

00:43:46.980 --> 00:43:48.940
and I'm very present
in the here and now.

00:43:48.940 --> 00:43:50.760
Excellent.

00:43:50.760 --> 00:43:51.260
Yeah.

00:43:51.260 --> 00:43:54.250
He's saying I have a
preference for expansiveness

00:43:54.250 --> 00:43:55.870
over contraction.

00:43:55.870 --> 00:43:59.450
I have a preference for
emptiness over density.

00:43:59.450 --> 00:44:01.540
But actually, if I
really sit with it,

00:44:01.540 --> 00:44:04.470
I see that I am both of those.

00:44:04.470 --> 00:44:06.650
There's nothing that
is beyond what I am.

00:44:06.650 --> 00:44:09.790
So I'm simply embedded in
the breadth of all things,

00:44:09.790 --> 00:44:12.630
in the coming and the going,
in the up and the down-- and in

00:44:12.630 --> 00:44:14.862
the peace, but also
in the struggle.

00:44:14.862 --> 00:44:16.820
And that's really one of
the points of my book,

00:44:16.820 --> 00:44:19.210
is that when you really
do practice and learn

00:44:19.210 --> 00:44:21.970
to identify that
you can find peace,

00:44:21.970 --> 00:44:23.600
you can find that
quality of happiness

00:44:23.600 --> 00:44:26.400
that he's talking about, even
in the midst of challenge

00:44:26.400 --> 00:44:27.190
and struggle.

00:44:27.190 --> 00:44:31.610
So you become identified, if you
will, with your truest nature.

00:44:31.610 --> 00:44:34.510
So that's kind of
really the short course.

00:44:34.510 --> 00:44:36.920
And I'd be happy to take
two or three questions

00:44:36.920 --> 00:44:38.400
before we finish.

00:44:38.400 --> 00:44:40.090
AUDIENCE: Earlier
on, you mentioned

00:44:40.090 --> 00:44:41.970
being influenced by a
philosopher and writer.

00:44:41.970 --> 00:44:46.157
And I was curious if you
could share the identity

00:44:46.157 --> 00:44:47.240
and how that impacted you.

00:44:47.240 --> 00:44:48.365
DIANE MUSHO HAMILTON: Yeah.

00:44:48.365 --> 00:44:49.340
His name is Ken Wilber.

00:44:49.340 --> 00:44:50.834
He's written about 30 books.

00:44:50.834 --> 00:44:53.000
They've been translated
into 30 different languages.

00:44:53.000 --> 00:44:54.280
They're all still in print.

00:44:54.280 --> 00:44:57.190
And you might want to call him
a meta-philosopher, that he

00:44:57.190 --> 00:44:59.870
was both, as a
young man, training

00:44:59.870 --> 00:45:01.910
to be a doctor and very
interested in science,

00:45:01.910 --> 00:45:04.030
but he had a deep
spiritual inclination.

00:45:04.030 --> 00:45:05.820
And his whole work
has been about trying

00:45:05.820 --> 00:45:08.130
to get those two things
to work together.

00:45:08.130 --> 00:45:12.530
So the largest book
he wrote on trying

00:45:12.530 --> 00:45:15.380
to create these connections
between the interior world

00:45:15.380 --> 00:45:19.420
and the exterior world
is called "Sex, Ecology,

00:45:19.420 --> 00:45:20.660
and Spirituality."

00:45:20.660 --> 00:45:22.250
It's a very big book, 850.

00:45:22.250 --> 00:45:25.800
But what he's trying to do is
name the challenges of our time

00:45:25.800 --> 00:45:30.750
and create the
links between, say,

00:45:30.750 --> 00:45:32.810
how we work with the
interior of the mind--

00:45:32.810 --> 00:45:34.720
awareness, psychology,
phenomenology--

00:45:34.720 --> 00:45:38.630
and how we work with
neurochemistry and the body.

00:45:38.630 --> 00:45:41.100
And so he's really
trying to create

00:45:41.100 --> 00:45:44.470
what we call an integral
inclusion of subject matter.

00:45:44.470 --> 00:45:47.177
AUDIENCE: And then are you also
drawing upon spiral dynamics?

00:45:47.177 --> 00:45:48.260
DIANE MUSHO HAMILTON: Yes.

00:45:48.260 --> 00:45:51.145
I'm drawing on Clare Graves'
work, which I did through Ken.

00:45:51.145 --> 00:45:52.270
AUDIENCE: Great, thank you.

00:45:52.270 --> 00:45:53.170
DIANE MUSHO HAMILTON:
You're very welcome.

00:45:53.170 --> 00:45:53.710
Yes, please?

00:45:53.710 --> 00:45:55.626
AUDIENCE: As someone who
did not grow up here,

00:45:55.626 --> 00:45:57.250
I feel terribly
advantaged in the fact

00:45:57.250 --> 00:46:00.140
that I have knowledge of
two different cultures.

00:46:00.140 --> 00:46:02.240
And I can pick from
two different places

00:46:02.240 --> 00:46:04.330
and select the best
of both the worlds.

00:46:04.330 --> 00:46:07.180
Having said that, at times I
feel disadvantaged in the fact

00:46:07.180 --> 00:46:10.700
that my ability to relate
with folks from back home

00:46:10.700 --> 00:46:12.580
and here is limited.

00:46:12.580 --> 00:46:15.100
DIANE MUSHO HAMILTON: It opens,
but it also creates limits.

00:46:15.100 --> 00:46:15.750
Yeah.

00:46:15.750 --> 00:46:17.940
Other people in the room
who feel that way as well?

00:46:17.940 --> 00:46:20.190
That you feel like you've
got this flexibility,

00:46:20.190 --> 00:46:22.720
but now you can't relate
to either world fully.

00:46:22.720 --> 00:46:23.220
Yeah.

00:46:23.220 --> 00:46:24.120
I agree.

00:46:24.120 --> 00:46:26.550
AUDIENCE: So this is
more a practical one.

00:46:26.550 --> 00:46:29.350
Before, you were
saying about how

00:46:29.350 --> 00:46:31.650
we need to become
comfortable with conflict

00:46:31.650 --> 00:46:33.220
and become trained in that.

00:46:33.220 --> 00:46:35.512
And as a software engineer,
every code review,

00:46:35.512 --> 00:46:36.970
every piece of code
that I check in

00:46:36.970 --> 00:46:38.178
is reviewed by somebody else.

00:46:38.178 --> 00:46:39.547
And so I get that a lot.

00:46:39.547 --> 00:46:41.630
There's always this, oh,
no, you've done it wrong.

00:46:41.630 --> 00:46:42.210
This is horrible.

00:46:42.210 --> 00:46:42.793
This is awful.

00:46:42.793 --> 00:46:45.329
[LAUGHTER]

00:46:45.329 --> 00:46:46.370
DIANE MUSHO HAMILTON: Ow.

00:46:46.370 --> 00:46:47.720
AUDIENCE: No, this is
a fact of life here.

00:46:47.720 --> 00:46:49.510
Everybody's good, and
everybody's picky.

00:46:49.510 --> 00:46:50.530
DIANE MUSHO HAMILTON:
Just do like my son does.

00:46:50.530 --> 00:46:52.196
My son has Down
Syndrome, and he'll just

00:46:52.196 --> 00:46:54.780
go, "Ow," whenever I
complain or criticize.

00:46:54.780 --> 00:46:57.670
AUDIENCE: So just as
a practical matter,

00:46:57.670 --> 00:47:01.270
how would you
suggest somebody get

00:47:01.270 --> 00:47:03.360
skilled in this who doesn't
have this opportunity?

00:47:03.360 --> 00:47:05.072
You can't just say
to your brother,

00:47:05.072 --> 00:47:07.280
oh, jump out at me with an
axe every once in a while.

00:47:07.280 --> 00:47:08.363
DIANE MUSHO HAMILTON: Yes.

00:47:08.363 --> 00:47:11.179
Well, this is one of the things
that I address in the book,

00:47:11.179 --> 00:47:12.970
is that basically what
you're talking about

00:47:12.970 --> 00:47:15.011
is you're talking about
a third person discourse.

00:47:15.011 --> 00:47:20.330
You're talking about an
empiric, engineering issue.

00:47:20.330 --> 00:47:21.790
But what's not
being addressed is

00:47:21.790 --> 00:47:23.740
what's happening in the
second person, what's

00:47:23.740 --> 00:47:25.830
happening in the relational
domain between you

00:47:25.830 --> 00:47:28.145
and me when you're giving
me feedback about the work

00:47:28.145 --> 00:47:28.770
that I've done.

00:47:28.770 --> 00:47:31.560
So great, even if
you're 100% right,

00:47:31.560 --> 00:47:33.460
is there a way we can
do that where I just

00:47:33.460 --> 00:47:35.280
don't feel kind of
accosted but rather I

00:47:35.280 --> 00:47:37.472
feel really supported
and included.

00:47:37.472 --> 00:47:38.930
And I think with
that, what I'll do

00:47:38.930 --> 00:47:41.480
is I'll give it back to Adam,
because Adam works in People

00:47:41.480 --> 00:47:43.720
Dev, and he can actually
answer that question

00:47:43.720 --> 00:47:47.521
about how we can bring more
of that quality to your team.

00:47:47.521 --> 00:47:48.520
So thank you, everybody.

00:47:48.520 --> 00:47:49.340
And here's Adam.

00:47:49.340 --> 00:47:50.100
Thanks so much.

00:47:50.100 --> 00:47:53.750
