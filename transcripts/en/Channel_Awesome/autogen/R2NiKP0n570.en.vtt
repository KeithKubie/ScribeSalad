know the waterbending wasn't taught to
 

00:01:46.079 --> 00:01:49.249
know the waterbending wasn't taught to
women or whatever just because um that

00:01:49.249 --> 00:01:49.259
women or whatever just because um that
 

00:01:49.259 --> 00:01:50.630
women or whatever just because um that
was something I felt like even though

00:01:50.630 --> 00:01:50.640
was something I felt like even though
 

00:01:50.640 --> 00:01:53.660
was something I felt like even though
it's true of our history that this kind

00:01:53.660 --> 00:01:53.670
it's true of our history that this kind
 

00:01:53.670 --> 00:01:55.130
it's true of our history that this kind
of stuff has been done and stuff hasn't

00:01:55.130 --> 00:01:55.140
of stuff has been done and stuff hasn't
 

00:01:55.140 --> 00:01:58.039
of stuff has been done and stuff hasn't
been taught to women it was a little too

00:01:58.039 --> 00:01:58.049
been taught to women it was a little too
 

00:01:58.049 --> 00:02:01.010
been taught to women it was a little too
close to home like wow okay this is I've

00:02:01.010 --> 00:02:01.020
close to home like wow okay this is I've
 

00:02:01.020 --> 00:02:02.539
close to home like wow okay this is I've
seen this before not too close like you

00:02:02.539 --> 00:02:02.549
seen this before not too close like you
 

00:02:02.549 --> 00:02:05.209
seen this before not too close like you
know uncomfortable but like just I kind

00:02:05.209 --> 00:02:05.219
know uncomfortable but like just I kind
 

00:02:05.219 --> 00:02:06.859
know uncomfortable but like just I kind
of felt like I've heard this lesson a

00:02:06.859 --> 00:02:06.869
of felt like I've heard this lesson a
 

00:02:06.869 --> 00:02:09.199
of felt like I've heard this lesson a
lot before where with this one's a

00:02:09.199 --> 00:02:09.209
lot before where with this one's a
 

00:02:09.209 --> 00:02:10.729
lot before where with this one's a
little bit more interesting because

00:02:10.729 --> 00:02:10.739
little bit more interesting because
 

00:02:10.739 --> 00:02:13.730
little bit more interesting because
they're their stones and there's some

00:02:13.730 --> 00:02:13.740
they're their stones and there's some
 

00:02:13.740 --> 00:02:15.200
they're their stones and there's some
think about like how do these stones

00:02:15.200 --> 00:02:15.210
think about like how do these stones
 

00:02:15.210 --> 00:02:17.510
think about like how do these stones
work and in this other world it seems

00:02:17.510 --> 00:02:17.520
work and in this other world it seems
 

00:02:17.520 --> 00:02:20.660
work and in this other world it seems
like there's it's more class and I don't

00:02:20.660 --> 00:02:20.670
like there's it's more class and I don't
 

00:02:20.670 --> 00:02:23.720
like there's it's more class and I don't
know that seems to I guess that's never

00:02:23.720 --> 00:02:23.730
know that seems to I guess that's never
 

00:02:23.730 --> 00:02:25.520
know that seems to I guess that's never
not going to be a fame on either a

00:02:25.520 --> 00:02:25.530
not going to be a fame on either a
 

00:02:25.530 --> 00:02:27.290
not going to be a fame on either a
sexism or racism or any of that stuff

00:02:27.290 --> 00:02:27.300
sexism or racism or any of that stuff
 

00:02:27.300 --> 00:02:29.300
sexism or racism or any of that stuff
but there's something about something

00:02:29.300 --> 00:02:29.310
but there's something about something
 

00:02:29.310 --> 00:02:30.710
but there's something about something
about the way they did here I found more

00:02:30.710 --> 00:02:30.720
about the way they did here I found more
 

00:02:30.720 --> 00:02:33.200
about the way they did here I found more
interesting I think when you find kind

00:02:33.200 --> 00:02:33.210
interesting I think when you find kind
 

00:02:33.210 --> 00:02:35.420
interesting I think when you find kind
of a different point of view it suddenly

00:02:35.420 --> 00:02:35.430
of a different point of view it suddenly
 

00:02:35.430 --> 00:02:37.310
of a different point of view it suddenly
becomes more fascinating that's well the

00:02:37.310 --> 00:02:37.320
becomes more fascinating that's well the
 

00:02:37.320 --> 00:02:38.540
becomes more fascinating that's well the
reasons I love to kill a mockingbird

00:02:38.540 --> 00:02:38.550
reasons I love to kill a mockingbird
 

00:02:38.550 --> 00:02:40.580
reasons I love to kill a mockingbird
because you know we've heard that kind

00:02:40.580 --> 00:02:40.590
because you know we've heard that kind
 

00:02:40.590 --> 00:02:43.010
because you know we've heard that kind
of story or over and over uh but not

00:02:43.010 --> 00:02:43.020
of story or over and over uh but not
 

00:02:43.020 --> 00:02:45.160
of story or over and over uh but not
from a child's point of view watching it

00:02:45.160 --> 00:02:45.170
from a child's point of view watching it
 

00:02:45.170 --> 00:02:47.930
from a child's point of view watching it
and that character was so interesting

00:02:47.930 --> 00:02:47.940
and that character was so interesting
 

00:02:47.940 --> 00:02:49.450
and that character was so interesting
it's the same thing here it's these

00:02:49.450 --> 00:02:49.460
it's the same thing here it's these
 

00:02:49.460 --> 00:02:52.100
it's the same thing here it's these
characters that suddenly become even

00:02:52.100 --> 00:02:52.110
characters that suddenly become even
 

00:02:52.110 --> 00:02:55.340
characters that suddenly become even
more interesting learning this because I

00:02:55.340 --> 00:02:55.350
more interesting learning this because I
 

00:02:55.350 --> 00:02:58.100
more interesting learning this because I
think especially with Perl it kind of

00:02:58.100 --> 00:02:58.110
think especially with Perl it kind of
 

00:02:58.110 --> 00:03:00.140
think especially with Perl it kind of
makes more sense now why she's such a

00:03:00.140 --> 00:03:00.150
makes more sense now why she's such a
 

00:03:00.150 --> 00:03:02.390
makes more sense now why she's such a
control freak and why she wants all the

00:03:02.390 --> 00:03:02.400
control freak and why she wants all the
 

00:03:02.400 --> 00:03:03.770
control freak and why she wants all the
details and why she wants to be on top

00:03:03.770 --> 00:03:03.780
details and why she wants to be on top
 

00:03:03.780 --> 00:03:06.110
details and why she wants to be on top
of everything and stuff because she's

00:03:06.110 --> 00:03:06.120
of everything and stuff because she's
 

00:03:06.120 --> 00:03:08.120
of everything and stuff because she's
coming from a background where she's not

00:03:08.120 --> 00:03:08.130
coming from a background where she's not
 

00:03:08.130 --> 00:03:09.800
coming from a background where she's not
supposed to do that and she's supposed

00:03:09.800 --> 00:03:09.810
supposed to do that and she's supposed
 

00:03:09.810 --> 00:03:11.540
supposed to do that and she's supposed
to be what sounds like a second-class

00:03:11.540 --> 00:03:11.550
to be what sounds like a second-class
 

00:03:11.550 --> 00:03:14.690
to be what sounds like a second-class
citizen so makes sense that not only

00:03:14.690 --> 00:03:14.700
citizen so makes sense that not only
 

00:03:14.700 --> 00:03:17.390
citizen so makes sense that not only
would she want to be in control but

00:03:17.390 --> 00:03:17.400
would she want to be in control but
 

00:03:17.400 --> 00:03:20.390
would she want to be in control but
she's also compensating for the lack of

00:03:20.390 --> 00:03:20.400
she's also compensating for the lack of
 

00:03:20.400 --> 00:03:23.180
she's also compensating for the lack of
control that's not only has she has been

00:03:23.180 --> 00:03:23.190
control that's not only has she has been
 

00:03:23.190 --> 00:03:25.910
control that's not only has she has been
forced upon her so that was very

00:03:25.910 --> 00:03:25.920
forced upon her so that was very
 

00:03:25.920 --> 00:03:28.370
forced upon her so that was very
interesting and that it kind of adds up

00:03:28.370 --> 00:03:28.380
interesting and that it kind of adds up
 

00:03:28.380 --> 00:03:30.200
interesting and that it kind of adds up
even more to the character all this

00:03:30.200 --> 00:03:30.210
even more to the character all this
 

00:03:30.210 --> 00:03:32.660
even more to the character all this
stuff it's not like what's interesting

00:03:32.660 --> 00:03:32.670
