00:00:05.690 --> 00:00:07.480
Hello, and welcome back.

00:00:07.480 --> 00:00:10.870
So, in our last lesson, we added
this lovely view leaderboards

00:00:10.870 --> 00:00:13.490
controller that
doesn't show anything,

00:00:13.490 --> 00:00:15.090
because we have no leaderboards.

00:00:15.090 --> 00:00:17.130
So let's think
about adding some.

00:00:17.130 --> 00:00:19.310
Now, we have three difficulty
levels in our game,

00:00:19.310 --> 00:00:20.570
easy, medium and hard.

00:00:20.570 --> 00:00:23.390
Probably makes sense for each
one have its own leaderboard.

00:00:23.390 --> 00:00:25.530
So let's go ahead and do that.

00:00:25.530 --> 00:00:32.710
I'm going to pop over to Chrome
here, and trick this a bit.

00:00:32.710 --> 00:00:37.150
And I'm going to go to
play.google.com/apps/publish,

00:00:37.150 --> 00:00:42.080
the developer console, and
check out our game services.

00:00:42.080 --> 00:00:45.720
And let's go in to
Guess My Number.

00:00:45.720 --> 00:00:47.940
So we can go into
a leaderboards.

00:00:47.940 --> 00:00:51.490
and the process here is fairly
similar to adding achievements.

00:00:51.490 --> 00:00:53.580
We fill out all the
various information

00:00:53.580 --> 00:00:54.820
that we need in a form.

00:00:54.820 --> 00:00:57.590
And then the system
generates a unique ID for us

00:00:57.590 --> 00:01:00.860
that we can use later to
refer to this leaderboard.

00:01:00.860 --> 00:01:02.330
So let's do that.

00:01:02.330 --> 00:01:05.250
I'm going to click
on Add Leaderboard.

00:01:05.250 --> 00:01:09.360
And for this one, our
name is going to be Easy.

00:01:09.360 --> 00:01:12.870
And this will be the leaderboard
for an easy difficulty level.

00:01:12.870 --> 00:01:14.630
We have some options
for score formatting.

00:01:14.630 --> 00:01:16.180
It can be numeric,
which would be

00:01:16.180 --> 00:01:18.210
like an integer, or
a floating point.

00:01:18.210 --> 00:01:20.570
We also have options
for currency and time.

00:01:20.570 --> 00:01:23.080
And maybe if we
wanted to do a fastest

00:01:23.080 --> 00:01:25.420
time to guess the answer
type of leaderboard,

00:01:25.420 --> 00:01:27.590
we can use time for that.

00:01:27.590 --> 00:01:28.810
We have an icon.

00:01:28.810 --> 00:01:29.980
This is optional.

00:01:29.980 --> 00:01:34.020
I do recommend using icons
if you want to create, say,

00:01:34.020 --> 00:01:38.540
actual games that you want
people to download and buy.

00:01:38.540 --> 00:01:42.700
The reason is that in the Play
Game standalone application,

00:01:42.700 --> 00:01:45.690
your leaderboard icons do
show up fairly prominently.

00:01:45.690 --> 00:01:47.882
Someone looks at your game,
one of the three screens

00:01:47.882 --> 00:01:49.590
that they're going to
see about your game

00:01:49.590 --> 00:01:51.030
are going to be
your leaderboards.

00:01:51.030 --> 00:01:53.250
And in those cases, it's
nice to have leaderboard

00:01:53.250 --> 00:01:55.860
icons that look interesting.

00:01:55.860 --> 00:01:58.490
In our case, we're going
to stick with the default

00:01:58.490 --> 00:02:01.290
leaderboard icon, as provided
by Play Game Services, which

00:02:01.290 --> 00:02:03.560
is like a little crown thing.

00:02:03.560 --> 00:02:05.490
Ordering here, we can
choose whether larger

00:02:05.490 --> 00:02:07.300
is better, or smaller is better.

00:02:07.300 --> 00:02:08.930
In this case, our
leaderboard is going

00:02:08.930 --> 00:02:10.889
to be based on the
number of guesses.

00:02:10.889 --> 00:02:14.090
So how many guesses did it
take to get the magic number?

00:02:14.090 --> 00:02:15.840
So in this case,
smaller is better.

00:02:15.840 --> 00:02:17.410
I do want to take
a moment to add,

00:02:17.410 --> 00:02:20.230
this is my favorite feature
of this developer console.

00:02:20.230 --> 00:02:22.052
Rather than having
ascending or descending,

00:02:22.052 --> 00:02:23.760
and then you have to
stop and think, well

00:02:23.760 --> 00:02:24.968
what does that actually mean?

00:02:24.968 --> 00:02:26.190
Like, smaller is better.

00:02:26.190 --> 00:02:27.340
So much clearer.

00:02:27.340 --> 00:02:28.280
Love it.

00:02:28.280 --> 00:02:31.570
Anyway, then we have limits,
and these are basically

00:02:31.570 --> 00:02:34.170
the upper and lower
bounds of any score that

00:02:34.170 --> 00:02:35.970
gets submitted to
this leaderboard.

00:02:35.970 --> 00:02:38.860
So I suppose we want
to say that we don't

00:02:38.860 --> 00:02:40.620
want to allow scores
lower than one.

00:02:40.620 --> 00:02:41.240
Makes sense.

00:02:41.240 --> 00:02:44.940
You can't actually make
a guess in zero guesses.

00:02:44.940 --> 00:02:48.920
And maybe for the small
leaderboard, we want to say,

00:02:48.920 --> 00:02:52.330
you know what, let's not
allow scores greater than 100.

00:02:52.330 --> 00:02:54.560
In theory, someone could
make the same wrong guess

00:02:54.560 --> 00:02:56.730
over and over and
over and over again,

00:02:56.730 --> 00:02:58.940
and maybe our players
are going to have

00:02:58.940 --> 00:03:01.450
some fun, perverse, hey, let's
see who can get the worst

00:03:01.450 --> 00:03:04.140
score in our Guess Our
Number game contest.

00:03:04.140 --> 00:03:06.730
Maybe that's something you
want to encourage your players

00:03:06.730 --> 00:03:08.800
to do, but in my case,
I'm going to say, no,

00:03:08.800 --> 00:03:10.600
let's not encourage
that behavior.

00:03:10.600 --> 00:03:13.376
We're just going to cap
our lower bounds, or, I

00:03:13.376 --> 00:03:15.640
guess our upper
bounds here, at 100.

00:03:15.640 --> 00:03:17.530
And list order means
that if you were

00:03:17.530 --> 00:03:20.750
to view your leaderboards, where
would this appear on the list?

00:03:20.750 --> 00:03:22.560
And we'll have it appear first.

00:03:22.560 --> 00:03:24.470
So there we go, this is done.

00:03:24.470 --> 00:03:28.560
I'm going to hit Save and
add another leaderboard.

00:03:28.560 --> 00:03:30.880
We'll create another
one for medium.

00:03:30.880 --> 00:03:32.230
This should be pretty easy.

00:03:32.230 --> 00:03:38.420
Smaller is better, and let's
allow scores of 1 and 1,000.

00:03:38.420 --> 00:03:40.470
Save and add
another leaderboard,

00:03:40.470 --> 00:03:48.610
and hard, smaller is
better, and 1 and 10,000.

00:03:48.610 --> 00:03:51.110
Let's save.

00:03:51.110 --> 00:03:52.410
And we're done, look at that.

00:03:52.410 --> 00:03:54.130
We've got three leaderboards.

00:03:54.130 --> 00:03:57.730
We have unique IDs associated
with each one of them.

00:03:57.730 --> 00:03:59.970
And they should be
ready to publish.

00:03:59.970 --> 00:04:01.430
We've actually
done everything we

00:04:01.430 --> 00:04:03.710
need to do to get a
leaderboard into our game.

00:04:03.710 --> 00:04:06.470
So let's go back to our
application and try it out.

00:04:06.470 --> 00:04:09.650
If I were to hit leaderboards
right now, I'd probably-- yeah,

00:04:09.650 --> 00:04:11.900
I'd get the cached version.

00:04:11.900 --> 00:04:14.190
So one quick way
to fix this would

00:04:14.190 --> 00:04:17.890
be to sign out and sign back in,
or you could just stop, and run

00:04:17.890 --> 00:04:19.589
our application again.

00:04:19.589 --> 00:04:22.019
And now it'll kind
of force our game

00:04:22.019 --> 00:04:24.700
to go out and grab
the latest data.

00:04:24.700 --> 00:04:26.660
So now when I
click leaderboards,

00:04:26.660 --> 00:04:30.760
I now have three entries,
easy, medium and hard.

00:04:30.760 --> 00:04:33.780
Now, if I were to
click on this easy one,

00:04:33.780 --> 00:04:35.785
I'm taken to my individual
leaderboard, where

00:04:35.785 --> 00:04:38.960
I can see entries for
public submissions

00:04:38.960 --> 00:04:41.630
this leaderboard, and
anybody from my circles

00:04:41.630 --> 00:04:43.700
that has submitted a
score to this leaderboard.

00:04:43.700 --> 00:04:46.030
In this case, this is a
brand new leaderboard,

00:04:46.030 --> 00:04:49.300
nobody has submitted anything,
so all these entries are blank.

00:04:49.300 --> 00:04:51.290
That's kind of too bad
and kind of boring.

00:04:51.290 --> 00:04:54.150
But that's OK because
in the next lesson,

00:04:54.150 --> 00:04:56.530
we'll start submitting
scores to these leaderboards.

00:04:56.530 --> 00:04:59.850
So stay tuned, and
I'll see you soon.
