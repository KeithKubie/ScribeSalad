00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.720
It's fan appreciation month at Screen Junkies,

00:00:02.720 --> 00:00:04.700
and to reward our awesome fans,

00:00:04.700 --> 00:00:07.320
we're making the Honest Trailers that YOU voted for!

00:00:07.700 --> 00:00:09.680
Here's your #3 choice:

00:00:13.720 --> 00:00:15.480
Based on a sneaker commercial,

00:00:15.480 --> 00:00:17.780
comes a film that got the rights to Michael Jordan

00:00:17.780 --> 00:00:19.020
and the Looney Tunes,

00:00:19.020 --> 00:00:20.200
then said "Screw it".

00:00:20.200 --> 00:00:21.920
That's all the work we're gonna put into this one."

00:00:21.940 --> 00:00:23.140
It's money time!"

00:00:23.460 --> 00:00:24.460
Space Jam.

00:00:25.020 --> 00:00:26.820
Experience the Citizen Kane

00:00:26.820 --> 00:00:28.400
of live-action, animated, hybrid

00:00:28.400 --> 00:00:29.600
basketball movies.

00:00:29.600 --> 00:00:31.120
Full of bright colors,

00:00:31.120 --> 00:00:32.360
cartoon violence,

00:00:32.360 --> 00:00:33.960
"Someone's killing someone."

00:00:34.060 --> 00:00:36.640
And second- tier, mid-nineties NBA stars

00:00:36.640 --> 00:00:39.480
that blew the tiny mind of every kid who saw it,

00:00:39.480 --> 00:00:42.520
and permanently blinded them to its many many flaws.

00:00:42.520 --> 00:00:44.480
Look millennials, I know you're just getting old enough

00:00:44.480 --> 00:00:46.020
to feel nostalgia for the first time,

00:00:46.020 --> 00:00:47.780
but trust me, this one sucks.

00:00:48.740 --> 00:00:50.460
Journey to the center of the earth

00:00:50.460 --> 00:00:52.720
where all the Looney Tunes live, apparently.

00:00:52.720 --> 00:00:54.180
For a story about aliens

00:00:54.180 --> 00:00:56.220
stealing the talent of basketball players,

00:00:56.220 --> 00:00:58.160
to win a game against Bugs Bunny,

00:00:58.160 --> 00:01:00.140
to rescue a failing amusement park

00:01:00.780 --> 00:01:02.640
that's so lazily told.

00:01:02.640 --> 00:01:05.260
No one even cares that Michael Jordan got kidnapped.

00:01:05.420 --> 00:01:07.920
You think Michael's all right?  
Boy, I'd hate to leave him like this.

00:01:08.080 --> 00:01:08.940
Oh, I'm sure he's fine.

00:01:09.140 --> 00:01:09.640
Cartoons are real.

00:01:09.640 --> 00:01:12.380
"You know that your friends are cartoon characters?"

00:01:12.460 --> 00:01:13.700
"Yeah, so?"

00:01:13.700 --> 00:01:16.100
Or that Bill Murray can travel between dimensions.

00:01:16.100 --> 00:01:18.140
"How did you get here, anyway?"

00:01:18.140 --> 00:01:19.740
"Producer's a friend of mine.

00:01:19.740 --> 00:01:21.200
Just had a teamster come and drop me off."

00:01:21.200 --> 00:01:22.900
I mean, I'm not mad that he's in this,

00:01:22.900 --> 00:01:25.300
just, try even a little bit next time?

00:01:25.300 --> 00:01:27.200
The movie doesn't even take place in space.

00:01:27.240 --> 00:01:28.940
It's called Space Jam!

00:01:29.380 --> 00:01:32.380
Return to Michael Jordan's weird baseball era

00:01:32.380 --> 00:01:35.760
that conspiracy theorists think was a 
secret suspension for gambling.

00:01:35.760 --> 00:01:38.820
"If we win, you give the NBA players their talent back.

00:01:38.860 --> 00:01:40.700
If you win, you get me."

00:01:40.760 --> 00:01:41.580
Hmm.

00:01:41.740 --> 00:01:44.060
Then cringe as your childhood hero

00:01:44.060 --> 00:01:47.040
shows off the limitations of his non-basketball skills,

00:01:47.180 --> 00:01:48.780
like, acting:

00:01:48.780 --> 00:01:50.540
"You're a cartoon; you're not real."

00:01:50.600 --> 00:01:51.320
Coaching:

00:01:51.320 --> 00:01:52.520
"Let's just go out and have fun."

00:01:52.520 --> 00:01:53.020
Yeah!

00:01:53.020 --> 00:01:54.360
Being a good teammate:

00:01:54.360 --> 00:01:56.520
"Somebody steal the ball, get it to me."

00:01:56.520 --> 00:01:57.800
Being a good friend:

00:01:57.800 --> 00:01:59.780
"Just face it, you guys stink."

00:01:59.780 --> 00:02:01.660
Wearing appropriate-sized khakis,

00:02:01.940 --> 00:02:03.460
and being a role model:

00:02:03.460 --> 00:02:06.480
"This goes against everything they 
taught me in health class."

00:02:06.700 --> 00:02:07.920
"Do you want to win or not?"

00:02:07.920 --> 00:02:11.640
Yikes, unless you're dunking on somebody, 
don't be like Mike, kids.

00:02:12.520 --> 00:02:15.580
Cling to your fleeting innocence with all your favorite loony tunes

00:02:16.040 --> 00:02:18.680
...or at least these bootleg sound-alikes, now that Mel Blanc is dead.

00:02:19.400 --> 00:02:20.840
"What's up doc?"

00:02:20.840 --> 00:02:23.260
...and rev your engines for the debut of Lola Bunny

00:02:23.640 --> 00:02:25.240
Oh yeah...

00:02:25.240 --> 00:02:28.440
Who gave boys a weird rabbit fetish long before Judy Hopps.

00:02:28.440 --> 00:02:31.380
As you laugh along with all their classic cartoon hijinks,

00:02:31.580 --> 00:02:34.100
and convieniently forget that must of this movies run-time

00:02:34.100 --> 00:02:36.260
...is dedicated to Newman trying not to get fired.

00:02:36.260 --> 00:02:38.260
"You're all right, you're all right!"

00:02:41.520 --> 00:02:44.580
Thrill at one of the worst referee games in basketball,

00:02:44.580 --> 00:02:46.840
since the ref in Airbud let a dog in the court.

00:02:47.140 --> 00:02:50.360
"He's right, ain't no rule said the dog can't play basketball."

00:02:50.360 --> 00:02:52.740
With dozens of flagrant fouls,

00:02:57.040 --> 00:02:58.460
Shady score-keeping,

00:02:58.460 --> 00:03:00.560
and a blatant disregard for solid fundamentals.

00:03:01.180 --> 00:03:03.340
"But if you don't find a 5th player,

00:03:03.340 --> 00:03:05.100
your team will forfeit the game."

00:03:05.540 --> 00:03:07.540
Oh NOW you care about the rules!

00:03:07.680 --> 00:03:11.080
Where were you when the two players in the tune-squad shot a monster in the face?!

00:03:12.200 --> 00:03:14.560
So enjoy a 90 minute long commercial.

00:03:14.560 --> 00:03:15.400
"Get your Hanes on,

00:03:15.400 --> 00:03:16.420
lace up your Nike',

00:03:16.420 --> 00:03:17.860
gran your Wheaties and your Gatorade,

00:03:17.860 --> 00:03:19.640
and we'll pick up a Big Mac on the way to the ballpark."

00:03:19.640 --> 00:03:20.660
That in retrospect,

00:03:20.660 --> 00:03:22.280
only exist to sell Looney Tunes' toys,

00:03:22.280 --> 00:03:23.420
and Air Jordans.

00:03:23.420 --> 00:03:25.100
"Cool shoes..."

00:03:25.100 --> 00:03:27.760
But sadly is still the best movie starring an NBA player.

00:03:28.060 --> 00:03:29.060
"You realize who I am?

00:03:30.080 --> 00:03:30.960
I'm your Genie!"

00:03:30.960 --> 00:03:31.680
...Euh

00:03:31.680 --> 00:03:33.680
Space jam 2 with Lebron it is.

00:03:34.380 --> 00:03:35.420
Starring:

00:03:35.420 --> 00:03:38.260
"A soundtrack that totally makes up for the mediocre movie"

00:03:38.260 --> 00:03:40.560
"Seal's version of 'Fly Like An Eagle"

00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:42.020
"Salt-N-Pepa"

00:03:42.020 --> 00:03:44.600
"R.Kelly's 'I Believe I Can Fly"

00:03:44.600 --> 00:03:47.040
"A duet between Chris Rock and Barry White"

00:03:47.180 --> 00:03:48.860
"More R.Kelly"

00:03:48.860 --> 00:03:50.660
"And that Quad City DJ's song, that's all

00:03:50.660 --> 00:03:51.840
'Come on and slam

00:03:51.840 --> 00:03:53.240
and welcome to the jam"

00:03:53.240 --> 00:03:53.740
Y'know,

00:03:53.740 --> 00:03:54.900
so good.

00:03:55.240 --> 00:03:56.280
"NBA Jam

00:03:56.280 --> 00:03:57.820
"NBA Jam, Toonament Edition"

00:03:59.320 --> 00:04:00.940
Y'know what else is better than the movie?

00:04:00.940 --> 00:04:01.800
The original website,

00:04:01.800 --> 00:04:04.600
that Warner Brothers hasn't changed since 1996.

from "xXx Return of Xander Cage."

00:04:27.880 --> 00:04:29.440
"I believe I can fly!

00:04:29.620 --> 00:04:31.620
I believe I can touch the sky!"

00:04:32.140 --> 00:04:33.900
"The entire bee movie script."

00:04:34.500 --> 00:04:35.880
"Call Kenny Loggins,

00:04:35.880 --> 00:04:37.780
'cause you're in the danger zone."

00:04:38.280 --> 00:04:39.380
"Goishey sloishey."

00:04:40.200 --> 00:04:41.600
"You're not my brother!

00:04:41.680 --> 00:04:43.840
You're just a pet who grew legs!"

00:04:44.240 --> 00:04:45.600
"He's got you in shrekmate,

00:04:45.680 --> 00:04:47.280
