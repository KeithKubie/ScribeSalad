&gt;&gt; Dan Rothstein is co-Director of the
Right Question Institute and co-Author

00:00:19.280 --> 00:00:25.220 position:66%
with Luz Santana of Make Just One Change,
teach students to ask their own questions.

00:00:25.220 --> 00:00:30.490
A former community organizer, urban
planner, and Fulbright Scholar,

00:00:30.490 --> 00:00:36.260 position:75%
he has a BA from Harvard College and a doctorate
from the Harvard Graduate School of Education.

00:00:36.260 --> 00:00:40.130
Dan is currently working with
the creators of the C-3 framework

00:00:40.130 --> 00:00:45.390 position:58%
to integrate the question formulation
technique into the inquiry arc.

00:00:45.390 --> 00:00:49.180
And I am going to mute myself
and say, welcome Dan,

00:00:49.180 --> 00:00:53.780 position:70%
we are glad to have you with us this evening.

00:00:53.780 --> 00:00:54.890
&gt;&gt; Well, welcome everybody.

00:00:54.890 --> 00:00:56.030
It's great to be with you.

00:00:56.030 --> 00:01:02.390 position:75%
I'm excited and honored to be able to
participate in this inaugural online conference.

00:01:02.390 --> 00:01:08.860 position:73%
I'm going to give you a quick look at the
question formulation technique and how teachers

00:01:08.860 --> 00:01:11.300
around the country at different
levels have used it,

00:01:11.300 --> 00:01:16.760 position:64%
have used it so their students can engage
more effectively with primary sources.

00:01:16.760 --> 00:01:20.950 position:70%
So I'm going to launch right into the process
and we'll have some opportunities for you

00:01:20.950 --> 00:01:24.440
to participate and lots of
opportunities to talk at the end.

00:01:24.440 --> 00:01:34.890 position:67%
So, I just wanted to let you know that we
do have a lot of materials available online

00:01:34.890 --> 00:01:39.180 position:70%
on our educator network at RightQuestion.org.

00:01:39.180 --> 00:01:43.540
And of course, this one will be
recorded, as you've seen before,

00:01:43.540 --> 00:01:47.490
and it will be on the Library
of Congress website.

00:01:47.490 --> 00:01:49.420
Okay, we're going to look
at question formulation

00:01:49.420 --> 00:01:52.390 position:67%
as a foundational and transformative skill.

00:01:52.390 --> 00:01:55.980 position:69%
We're going to look first at the development

00:01:55.980 --> 00:01:58.930
of the question formulation
technique, how it developed.

00:01:58.930 --> 00:02:02.260
We began in 1990.

00:02:02.260 --> 00:02:06.840 position:58%
My co-author, Lose Santana, and I
and several other people were working

00:02:06.840 --> 00:02:10.310
on a dropout prevention program
in Lawrence, Massachusetts.

00:02:10.310 --> 00:02:11.460
And we heard from parents.

00:02:11.460 --> 00:02:13.240
It was a low-income community.

00:02:13.240 --> 00:02:15.480
Parents weren't participating
in the children's education.

00:02:15.480 --> 00:02:18.100
We heard from them that they
weren't participating

00:02:18.100 --> 00:02:20.640 position:66%
because they didn't even know what to ask.

00:02:20.640 --> 00:02:22.960 position:73%
So we thought, okay, we can solve that problem.

00:02:22.960 --> 00:02:24.540 position:59%
And of course, we did the wrong thing.

00:02:24.540 --> 00:02:29.350 position:70%
We gave them a list of questions and realized
that that only created more dependency on us

00:02:29.350 --> 00:02:31.520 position:63%
to keep on coming up with the questions.

00:02:31.520 --> 00:02:36.690 position:75%
So we went to work at figuring out how you
teach what is really a very sophisticated skill,

00:02:36.690 --> 00:02:38.880 position:70%
that very often is learned only through years

00:02:38.880 --> 00:02:43.140
of professional training
and practice, to all people.

00:02:43.140 --> 00:02:47.190 position:70%
And it was a long process of trial and error.

00:02:47.190 --> 00:02:51.880
Eventually, we came upon a process,
the question formulation technique,

00:02:51.880 --> 00:02:54.410 position:56%
that's been used in multiple fields.

00:02:54.410 --> 00:03:00.340 position:58%
There's been research done on it and
its application to family engagement.

00:03:00.340 --> 00:03:04.140 position:58%
There's been a lot of work and
researched done its use in healthcare

00:03:04.140 --> 00:03:06.950
with the National Institutes of
Health Study showing the doubling

00:03:06.950 --> 00:03:09.450 position:59%
and tripling of patient participation.

00:03:09.450 --> 00:03:13.850
And there's been a lot of interest
in the private sector recently,

00:03:13.850 --> 00:03:19.400 position:75%
thanks to Warner Burgers book, "A More Beautiful
Question," where he featured our work as,

00:03:19.400 --> 00:03:21.400
if you want people to learn
how to ask questions,

00:03:21.400 --> 00:03:24.240 position:66%
here's an effective strategy for doing it.

00:03:24.240 --> 00:03:26.930
So it's been used in many places.

00:03:26.930 --> 00:03:30.880 position:73%
And of course, it's been used in the classroom.

00:03:30.880 --> 00:03:34.800 position:64%
When we published our book a few years
ago, we didn't know quite what to expect.

00:03:34.800 --> 00:03:40.150 position:73%
But what we've seen is an educator-led
movement, teachers and educators at all levels,

00:03:40.150 --> 00:03:43.350
who have embraced the question
formulation technique.

00:03:43.350 --> 00:03:46.860
More than 100,000 educators
around the world are using it.

00:03:46.860 --> 00:03:50.940 position:56%
And using it not that it's
required or mandated in any setting,

00:03:50.940 --> 00:03:54.850
but because it addresses a
problem that they recognize.

00:03:54.850 --> 00:03:58.810 position:69%
And that's, you know, part of the reason why

00:03:58.810 --> 00:04:04.100
that they're using it is
perhaps captured in these charts.

00:04:04.100 --> 00:04:10.880 position:73%
You can see in this chart, a basic skill
attainment, that shows a generally upward slope

00:04:10.880 --> 00:04:13.540 position:58%
of reading skills and writing skills.

00:04:13.540 --> 00:04:17.310
And then if you look at this chart,
you see the yellow line going down,

00:04:17.310 --> 00:04:21.230 position:64%
and that's the slope of asking questions.

00:04:21.230 --> 00:04:28.560 position:56%
And you see a sharp drop off from
4-year-olds going reaching the peak,

00:04:28.560 --> 00:04:31.280 position:58%
and then a sharp drop-off after that.

00:04:31.280 --> 00:04:36.650 position:75%
Now, part of the reason for that is because, as
you all know, there's a lot of pressure to focus

00:04:36.650 --> 00:04:41.570
on answers, answers to tests and
exams, getting the right answers.

00:04:41.570 --> 00:04:48.910 position:75%
And certainly getting the right answers is a
good goal, but there's also a role for the skill

00:04:48.910 --> 00:04:53.690 position:67%
of question formulation and developing that
skill in order to get to better answers.

00:04:53.690 --> 00:04:57.410 position:59%
And I think that that's being
recognized today because, for example,

00:04:57.410 --> 00:05:02.120 position:73%
there's a strong movement towards inquiry-based
learning, the Common Core state standards,

00:05:02.120 --> 00:05:06.040
Next-Generation of Science
standards, college, and of course,

00:05:06.040 --> 00:05:09.080 position:56%
the C-3 framework for social studies
where they've done a great job

00:05:09.080 --> 00:05:12.850 position:72%
at building inquiry right through the process.

00:05:12.850 --> 00:05:14.890 position:70%
And we're excited now to be working with them

00:05:14.890 --> 00:05:20.650 position:61%
and how to use the question formulation
technique as part of that process.

00:05:20.650 --> 00:05:24.100
So we are looking at how
to accelerate the movement

00:05:24.100 --> 00:05:27.450 position:69%
from teacher questions to student questions.

00:05:27.450 --> 00:05:32.550 position:69%
When students ask questions, their questions
become a catalyst for greater curiosity,

00:05:32.550 --> 00:05:35.960
for engagement, for ownership,
and for deeper learning.

00:05:35.960 --> 00:05:38.920
And so I'm going to give
you a quick introduction now

00:05:38.920 --> 00:05:41.970
to how the question formulation
technique does that.

00:05:41.970 --> 00:05:47.600 position:72%
It basically helps accelerate the shift, in
that one shift, from teachers asking questions

00:05:47.600 --> 00:05:51.020
of students to students asking
their own questions.

00:05:51.020 --> 00:05:55.650 position:63%
It distills some of the best pedagogical
practices into a very simple teaching

00:05:55.650 --> 00:06:01.460 position:70%
and learning process that makes it assessable
for all teachers, novices and veterans alike.

00:06:01.460 --> 00:06:07.050 position:67%
And it offers a shortcut to student
engagement, ownership, and deeper learning.

00:06:07.050 --> 00:06:13.520 position:61%
So any -- when the question formulation
technique is used in the classroom,

00:06:13.520 --> 00:06:17.720 position:59%
students learn to work with their
questions, and that specifically means

00:06:17.720 --> 00:06:21.880 position:67%
that they're producing their own
questions, which is significant on its own.

00:06:21.880 --> 00:06:25.220 position:58%
They're actually working with their
questions to improve their questions.

00:06:25.220 --> 00:06:28.260 position:72%
They strategize on how to use their questions.

00:06:28.260 --> 00:06:35.670 position:73%
And as part of the process, they reflect on
what they have learned and how they learned it.

00:06:35.670 --> 00:06:40.800 position:64%
So now, let's take a look at the question
formulation technique in practice,

00:06:40.800 --> 00:06:45.200
and give you an opportunity
to ask some questions.

00:06:45.200 --> 00:06:52.270 position:61%
So let's look at this set of rules that
we've created for producing questions.

00:06:52.270 --> 00:06:54.520
There are 4 rules here.

00:06:54.520 --> 00:07:00.310 position:59%
I want you to know that it took us
about 8 years to create those 4 rules.

00:07:00.310 --> 00:07:04.970 position:73%
Now, I'm sure you're all doing the math there
and figuring that we've done 1/2 a rule a year.

00:07:04.970 --> 00:07:11.320 position:73%
Actually, what we had to do is we had to figure
out how not to create a list of a hundred rules

00:07:11.320 --> 00:07:14.920
on how to get students who were
not accustomed to asking questions

00:07:14.920 --> 00:07:16.550 position:59%
to actually start producing questions.

00:07:16.550 --> 00:07:20.130
And we tried to look at what's
the simplest way to do that.

00:07:20.130 --> 00:07:21.740
And here are the 4 rules.

00:07:21.740 --> 00:07:24.460 position:67%
Number 1, ask as many questions as you can.

00:07:24.460 --> 00:07:27.920 position:72%
Two, do not stop to answer, judge, or discuss.

00:07:27.920 --> 00:07:31.790
Three, write down every question
exactly as stated.

00:07:31.790 --> 00:07:34.790 position:69%
And 4, change any statements into questions.

00:07:34.790 --> 00:07:38.900 position:59%
Of course, we would like the first
one, ask as many questions as you can,

00:07:38.900 --> 00:07:42.130 position:69%
to be sufficient, but as you know, it's not.

00:07:42.130 --> 00:07:46.690 position:56%
There's a need to create a structure
and a safe space for doing that.

00:07:46.690 --> 00:07:50.090 position:66%
So take a moment, look at those questions,
and think about what might be difficult

00:07:50.090 --> 00:07:54.280
for you in following these rules.

00:07:57.180 --> 00:08:01.440 position:58%
Which of the rules do you think might
be most difficult for you to follow?

00:08:04.270 --> 00:08:09.410 position:56%
So we're going to now take a look at
an example, and you're going to get

00:08:09.410 --> 00:08:14.040 position:66%
to use these rules and ask some questions.

00:08:14.040 --> 00:08:18.170
So I'm going to show you now
what we call a question focus,

00:08:18.170 --> 00:08:22.140
which is meant to be the
catalyst for student questions.

00:08:22.140 --> 00:08:25.530
So it's not a question from
the teacher of the students,

00:08:25.530 --> 00:08:32.360 position:67%
but rather it's a teacher designed selected
focus for them to start asking questions.

00:08:32.360 --> 00:08:35.550 position:69%
So here, take a look at this question focus.

00:08:35.550 --> 00:08:39.640
Take a moment there.

00:08:41.160 --> 00:08:48.470
That's the caning of sumner, and
it may be familiar to you all.

00:08:48.470 --> 00:08:53.680 position:64%
And it happened in the US Senate in 1856.

00:08:53.680 --> 00:08:58.370 position:73%
So you're now going to get a chance to look at
some student questions, but before you do that,

00:08:58.370 --> 00:09:05.190 position:56%
what are some questions that you
might ask about this question focus?

00:09:10.840 --> 00:09:15.450
Remember not to edit yourselves.

00:09:15.450 --> 00:09:18.260
Write down a few questions
as quickly as you can.

00:09:18.260 --> 00:09:32.080 position:72%
Okay, I would love for you to be able to keep
on asking questions, but I'm going to take you

00:09:32.080 --> 00:09:33.880 position:73%
through the whole process to take a look at it.

00:09:33.880 --> 00:09:37.420 position:75%
And I seen in a lot of the questions in the chat

00:09:37.420 --> 00:09:43.270 position:67%
that you'll enjoy seeing the sixth-graders'
questions as I present them to you now.

00:09:43.270 --> 00:09:47.370
So this was a teacher here in
the Boston, Massachusetts, area,

00:09:47.370 --> 00:09:49.650
teaching a unit on the Civil War.

00:09:49.650 --> 00:09:52.900
And she used the question focus and
the question formulation technique

00:09:52.900 --> 00:09:56.290
as a pre-reading activity
to engage the students.

00:09:56.290 --> 00:09:59.320 position:58%
So now let's look at their questions.

00:09:59.320 --> 00:10:00.520
Why are they fighting?

00:10:00.520 --> 00:10:01.530
Are they fighting?

00:10:01.530 --> 00:10:03.250
Are they part of the government?

00:10:03.250 --> 00:10:04.370
Where were they?

00:10:04.370 --> 00:10:09.130
Very key question that they
asking right up front there.

00:10:09.130 --> 00:10:10.360
What started the fight?

00:10:10.360 --> 00:10:11.150
Who are they?

00:10:11.150 --> 00:10:12.430
Were they signing anything?

00:10:12.430 --> 00:10:13.400
Who else was there?

00:10:13.400 --> 00:10:14.530
Why are you hitting him?

00:10:14.530 --> 00:10:17.590
Which, of course, is a great
middle school question too.

00:10:17.590 --> 00:10:22.040
And then, why didn't they call 911?

00:10:22.040 --> 00:10:26.010
So that's one to enjoy there
in the middle of this list.

00:10:26.010 --> 00:10:28.100
But look at the very next question.

00:10:28.100 --> 00:10:30.350
Was this related to slavery?

00:10:30.350 --> 00:10:33.950 position:69%
And it moves all the way through to the end.

00:10:33.950 --> 00:10:36.580
Why are they smiling?

00:10:36.580 --> 00:10:40.320 position:63%
And I notice from the chat that somebody
asked a question about that as well.

00:10:40.320 --> 00:10:43.230 position:70%
Somebody else asked a question about the end.

00:10:43.230 --> 00:10:47.870 position:73%
So you'll see that you had questions that were
similar to the questions that they were asking.

00:10:47.870 --> 00:10:49.790
I love number 15 as well.

00:10:49.790 --> 00:10:50.600
Who hit who first?

00:10:50.600 --> 00:10:53.410 position:72%
Which is truly a great middle school question.

00:10:53.410 --> 00:10:56.540
So there you see what happens
when students get a chance

00:10:56.540 --> 00:11:00.140
to produce their own questions
following those rules.

00:11:00.140 --> 00:11:03.380
If you look at question number
18, why are they smiling,

00:11:03.380 --> 00:11:06.300 position:69%
that's a detail that I certainly had missed.

00:11:06.300 --> 00:11:08.500 position:66%
I know that some of you had not missed it.

00:11:08.500 --> 00:11:14.480 position:75%
And it's a really interesting thing for them to
be observing, that shows the level of engagement

00:11:14.480 --> 00:11:18.180
with the primary source of how
carefully they are looking at it.

00:11:18.180 --> 00:11:23.220 position:59%
So now, let's look at the next step
in the question formulation technique.

00:11:23.220 --> 00:11:29.210 position:75%
And that's where we have students think about
open-ended questions and closed-ended questions.

00:11:29.210 --> 00:11:32.500
We use a simple definition of
close-ended as being able to answer

00:11:32.500 --> 00:11:34.760 position:59%
with a yes or no or a one-word answer.

00:11:34.760 --> 00:11:38.360
And open-ended questions
requiring more explanation.

00:11:38.360 --> 00:11:41.800
And in the process, we would have
students identify the questions

00:11:41.800 --> 00:11:43.380
as close-ended or open-ended.

00:11:43.380 --> 00:11:48.040 position:73%
And it's always very interesting to see them do
this work, find that there are some questions

00:11:48.040 --> 00:11:51.480
that are kind of in the gray area,
they're not quite sure what to do.

00:11:51.480 --> 00:11:55.530 position:72%
But they're becoming more sophisticated as
they're actually working with their questions.

00:11:55.530 --> 00:11:59.270 position:75%
And at that point, we asked them to think about,

00:11:59.270 --> 00:12:03.050
what are some of the advantages
of close-ended questions.

00:12:03.050 --> 00:12:06.720 position:63%
And that sometimes is a bit of a shock
because they might've gotten the message

00:12:06.720 --> 00:12:10.810 position:66%
that open-ended questions are better than
close-ended questions, so they first start

00:12:10.810 --> 00:12:15.150 position:58%
to have to think about, what are some
advantages of a close-ended question.

00:12:15.150 --> 00:12:18.300 position:58%
So as you think about that, what are
some things that come to mind for you

00:12:18.300 --> 00:12:21.970 position:75%
about some advantages to a close-ended question?

00:12:24.510 --> 00:12:28.520
Then we have them move on
to look at disadvantages.

00:12:28.520 --> 00:12:31.740
What are some disadvantages
of close-ended question?

00:12:31.740 --> 00:12:36.340 position:73%
So in the advantages, they very often will
talk about, it's quick, you get a quick answer,

00:12:36.340 --> 00:12:42.240
you can focus on the next question
that you need to be asking.

00:12:42.240 --> 00:12:46.190 position:59%
The disadvantages sometimes, it
limits the information you're getting,

00:12:46.190 --> 00:12:47.690
it cuts off discussion.

00:12:47.690 --> 00:12:51.350
So then we have them move on to
look at open-ended questions.

00:12:51.350 --> 00:12:55.310
And ask them to think about the
advantages of open-ended questions.

00:12:55.310 --> 00:12:57.050 position:66%
And they come up with comments that are --

00:12:57.050 --> 00:13:00.580
would be familiar to you in
terms of invites discussion,

00:13:00.580 --> 00:13:03.400
allows for further explanation,
more exploration.

00:13:03.400 --> 00:13:09.250 position:70%
And then when they think about disadvantages,
they also identify some of the challenges.

00:13:09.250 --> 00:13:13.300 position:73%
Sometimes you can get an answer that overwhelms
you, that you don't quite know what to do

00:13:13.300 --> 00:13:16.550
with it, you're not clear
about what the answer is.

00:13:16.550 --> 00:13:21.660
So they realize that there's
advantages and disadvantages

00:13:21.660 --> 00:13:25.960 position:63%
to both closed and open-ended questions.

00:13:25.960 --> 00:13:29.990
The important thing is to be able
to ask different kinds of questions

00:13:29.990 --> 00:13:34.870 position:70%
and to have the ability to take an open-ended
question and change it to a closed to see

00:13:34.870 --> 00:13:40.160 position:75%
if that helps you with your work, or vice versa,
to take a closed and change it to an open.

00:13:40.160 --> 00:13:46.890 position:63%
So let's look at how one class did this.

00:13:46.890 --> 00:13:51.950 position:69%
So in taking the close-ended and changing it
to open and taking an open-ended to a close,

00:13:51.950 --> 00:13:55.120
I bring you this example from
Lexington, Massachusetts,

00:13:55.120 --> 00:13:57.150 position:61%
Maureen Bennett, a third-grade teacher.

00:13:57.150 --> 00:14:01.620
And she was introducing unit
on the Mayflower Compact.

00:14:01.620 --> 00:14:06.430
And the question focus was very
simply, the Mayflower Compact.

00:14:06.430 --> 00:14:10.350 position:75%
The students viewed the primary source on iPads.

00:14:10.350 --> 00:14:13.920
So take a look at it, that's
the Mayflower Compact.

00:14:13.920 --> 00:14:20.090 position:72%
The students were looking at it, and their job
was to follow those rules that we introduced

00:14:20.090 --> 00:14:24.470
to you earlier and ask questions.

00:14:24.470 --> 00:14:27.660
So now, when I'm going to show
you here, and this part is not --

00:14:27.660 --> 00:14:30.950 position:73%
we're not going to look at all their questions,
we're just going to zero in on the ones

00:14:30.950 --> 00:14:37.530 position:75%
that they changed from open to closed and closed
to open, so you can see how that process works.

00:14:37.530 --> 00:14:39.960 position:70%
So their student questions, look at number 5.

00:14:39.960 --> 00:14:42.550
Did the Indians sign it?

00:14:42.550 --> 00:14:45.510
And understood that that
was a close-ended question,

00:14:45.510 --> 00:14:47.960
and they want to move it
to an open-ended question.

00:14:47.960 --> 00:14:50.090 position:64%
So they asked how many Indians signed it,

00:14:50.090 --> 00:14:54.130
which is very interesting thinking
about trying to open that up.

00:14:54.130 --> 00:14:57.300
And again, they could see
advantages and disadvantages,

00:14:57.300 --> 00:15:01.940 position:72%
where they could see the advantages of getting
a definitive answer to their first question.

00:15:01.940 --> 00:15:06.550 position:70%
But it was good for them to practice changing
the question, thinking about it some more.

00:15:06.550 --> 00:15:10.150
And the question right after that
is, did the Pilgrims sign it?

00:15:10.150 --> 00:15:12.800 position:64%
And then opening it up to, who signed it?

00:15:12.800 --> 00:15:17.910
Where they wanted to explore
who might have signed it,

00:15:17.910 --> 00:15:21.280
maybe who didn't sign it, who
was included in the signing.

00:15:21.280 --> 00:15:24.740
So it allowed them an opportunity
to expand their horizons.

00:15:24.740 --> 00:15:28.700
And then their last question
there, who is Lord James.

00:15:28.700 --> 00:15:33.630 position:58%
And that got them thinking about text
that they're reading in the compact,

00:15:33.630 --> 00:15:38.650
and they wanted to know was Lord
James asking what is furtherance.

00:15:38.650 --> 00:15:44.000 position:66%
So they were grappling with a very
difficult text, asking questions about it,

00:15:44.000 --> 00:15:48.910 position:73%
practicing changing their questions from closed
to open and open to closed and discovering

00:15:48.910 --> 00:15:53.220 position:56%
that they had more questions to ask.

00:15:53.220 --> 00:15:57.380
So now, let's take a look at
the next step in the process

00:15:57.380 --> 00:16:00.080 position:59%
of the question formulation technique.

00:16:00.080 --> 00:16:01.920
Prioritizing questions.

00:16:01.920 --> 00:16:05.780 position:66%
So students have produced their questions,
they've done some work on open and closed,

00:16:05.780 --> 00:16:09.130 position:72%
they've changed them, they've identified them.

00:16:09.130 --> 00:16:12.360 position:69%
And now we want students to be prioritizing.

00:16:12.360 --> 00:16:17.130 position:73%
Prioritization instructions should be connected
to your teaching and learning objectives

00:16:17.130 --> 00:16:20.050
and to your plan for using
the student questions.

00:16:20.050 --> 00:16:25.070 position:67%
So here are some examples of prioritization
instructions that you could give.

00:16:25.070 --> 00:16:28.980
Choose 3 questions that you
consider most important.

00:16:28.980 --> 00:16:33.420
That instruction gets them thinking
about what's important to them.

00:16:33.420 --> 00:16:35.700
And that's a wide-open invitation.

00:16:35.700 --> 00:16:42.440 position:72%
It is a very open-ended invitation for them to
do thinking and for them to prioritize based

00:16:42.440 --> 00:16:46.230
on what interests them or
they consider most important.

00:16:46.230 --> 00:16:49.520 position:72%
Then there's a different kind of
prioritization instructions where you're going

00:16:49.520 --> 00:16:53.660 position:67%
to have them do research and you want them
to start thinking about research questions.

00:16:53.660 --> 00:16:57.350
So you want them to choose 3 that
will help them with their research.

00:16:57.350 --> 00:17:02.460 position:72%
Then maybe in a different setting, you might
want to use the question formulation technique

00:17:02.460 --> 00:17:05.570 position:66%
for a specific reading assignment purpose.

00:17:05.570 --> 00:17:10.040 position:64%
So you might give them the prioritization
instruction of choose 3 questions

00:17:10.040 --> 00:17:11.510
that can be answered as you read.

00:17:11.510 --> 00:17:18.930 position:70%
And as you look at the last one, you can give
an instruction that, if you think about it,

00:17:18.930 --> 00:17:22.200
it's similar to what the Stanford
History Education Group's reading,

00:17:22.200 --> 00:17:26.840
like a historian emphasizes about
the importance of students thinking

00:17:26.840 --> 00:17:28.250
about the author's point of view.

00:17:28.250 --> 00:17:34.250 position:61%
So you could give instructions that say
choose 3 questions that will help you

00:17:34.250 --> 00:17:36.500 position:59%
to explore the author's point of view.

00:17:36.500 --> 00:17:43.690 position:67%
So it's a robust model that allows you with
your teaching goals and specific content

00:17:43.690 --> 00:17:49.470 position:72%
that you're teaching, specific objectives, for
you to be able to get the students thinking

00:17:49.470 --> 00:17:51.640
on their own about the key issues.

00:17:51.640 --> 00:17:55.660
So let's look at an example
of that prioritization.

00:17:55.660 --> 00:18:02.950 position:67%
This is a eighth-grade classroom in a rural
New Hampshire town, taught by Joshua Bier.

00:18:02.950 --> 00:18:08.080
And he had just done a unit
on American imperialism.

00:18:08.080 --> 00:18:12.940 position:69%
And so he's using the question formulation
technique for summative assessment purposes.

00:18:12.940 --> 00:18:16.910 position:58%
And if you think about that, you had
just looked at 2 examples of teachers

00:18:16.910 --> 00:18:19.430 position:73%
who were using it at the beginning of the unit.

00:18:19.430 --> 00:18:22.620
Here, Josh Bier is using
it at the end of the unit.

00:18:22.620 --> 00:18:27.480 position:56%
And here was his queue focus, that's
what we call the question focus.

00:18:27.480 --> 00:18:29.070
It's very simple.

00:18:29.070 --> 00:18:37.710 position:70%
Questions that should be asked about American
imperialism at the turn of the 20th century.

00:18:38.990 --> 00:18:42.770 position:66%
So they've just studied American
imperialism at the turn of the 20 century,

00:18:42.770 --> 00:18:49.780 position:70%
and he wants them to come up with a list of
questions that can be used on the final exam.

00:18:49.780 --> 00:18:53.870
So their job is to come up with
questions that should be asked

00:18:53.870 --> 00:18:57.600
about American imperialism at
the turn of the 20th century.

00:18:57.600 --> 00:19:02.610 position:59%
So let's take a look at what they did.

00:19:02.610 --> 00:19:04.780 position:58%
They came up with a lot of questions.

00:19:04.780 --> 00:19:09.210
I'm just showing you here just
one group's set of questions.

00:19:09.210 --> 00:19:11.430
They were working in small
groups, there were different groups

00:19:11.430 --> 00:19:13.370
with different sets of questions.

00:19:13.370 --> 00:19:16.930
And this group chose as their
3 priority questions.

00:19:16.930 --> 00:19:23.640 position:63%
Why did the Hawaiian natives in Quin not
want the United States to annex Hawaii?

00:19:23.640 --> 00:19:29.980 position:70%
So there you see the level of specificity and
specific situation they wanted to know about,

00:19:29.980 --> 00:19:33.030
and they felt that that is a
question that should be answered

00:19:33.030 --> 00:19:36.250
about American imperialism at
the turn of the 20th century.

00:19:36.250 --> 00:19:39.080 position:56%
Then you leap to question number 10.

00:19:39.080 --> 00:19:43.670
How does the Spanish-American
war effect America?

00:19:43.670 --> 00:19:48.550 position:58%
So there's a global question, a
large question, with an understanding

00:19:48.550 --> 00:19:53.020 position:72%
of policy implications and changes in society.

00:19:53.020 --> 00:19:58.230 position:67%
And then you look at number 12, which
actually didn't exist on the original list.

00:19:58.230 --> 00:20:01.140 position:56%
It was originally question number 6.

00:20:01.140 --> 00:20:05.320
Which was, what was Alfred Their
Mann's stance on imperialism?

00:20:05.320 --> 00:20:11.640 position:75%
And they changed it to, why did Alfred Their
Mann have the stance that he did on imperialism?

00:20:11.640 --> 00:20:15.920
So there you've got them working
on the author's perspective

00:20:15.920 --> 00:20:20.600 position:66%
on a significant influence on imperialism.

00:20:20.600 --> 00:20:23.670
And look at the very next
question that they asked.

00:20:23.670 --> 00:20:27.090
Did Alfred Their Mann's book
influence imperialism?

00:20:27.090 --> 00:20:29.230
So there you see they prioritized.

00:20:29.230 --> 00:20:35.440 position:69%
And it's really interesting when you look at
this example, that you can actually see this

00:20:35.440 --> 00:20:40.470 position:61%
on our website, there is the full video
of them using this in a classroom.

00:20:40.470 --> 00:20:44.730
I'm going to show you now a very
quick trailer from that video

00:20:44.730 --> 00:20:49.510 position:63%
so you can see them doing this work
with the question formulation technique.

00:20:53.540 --> 00:20:55.580
&gt;&gt; What country developed the most?

00:20:55.580 --> 00:20:59.110
&gt;&gt; Why did the United States
want to annex Hawaii?

00:20:59.110 --> 00:21:04.350
&gt;&gt; [inaudible] Panama Canal?

00:21:04.350 --> 00:21:07.150 position:61%
&gt;&gt; The purpose is to get them thinking,

00:21:07.150 --> 00:21:10.440
to get them questioning what
do I know about this subject.

00:21:10.440 --> 00:21:14.890 position:67%
And the great thing about working in groups
is that if you come up with a question,

00:21:14.890 --> 00:21:20.670 position:72%
that may generate a whole new line of thinking
for me, then I can add an additional question

00:21:20.670 --> 00:21:23.030
that may generate another line
of thinking from somebody else.

00:21:23.030 --> 00:21:24.970 position:63%
&gt;&gt; Who was the biggest anti-imperialist?

00:21:24.970 --> 00:21:27.860 position:75%
&gt;&gt; [inaudible] All of these could go either way.

00:21:27.860 --> 00:21:33.720 position:56%
&gt;&gt; Why is it so important for
America to have overseas bases open?

00:21:33.720 --> 00:21:41.660
&gt;&gt; It covers a wide variety of what
happened in the imperialistic era.

00:21:41.660 --> 00:21:46.310 position:64%
&gt;&gt; You could ask one main question and
then build questions off of that question

00:21:46.310 --> 00:21:49.760 position:58%
and it makes me think more and you
have to pull stuff out of your brain.

00:21:49.760 --> 00:21:52.500
And when you do that, you
have to remember it again.

00:21:52.500 --> 00:21:57.810 position:69%
And the more you take it out and remember
it again, the deeper it gets into your brain

00:21:57.810 --> 00:21:59.610 position:59%
and the more easier it is to remember.

00:21:59.610 --> 00:22:02.790 position:59%
&gt;&gt; You never really know what you know
about the subject until you see it

00:22:02.790 --> 00:22:05.310 position:61%
from others and your own point of view.

00:22:05.310 --> 00:22:10.280 position:73%
&gt;&gt; I think that's one of the great things about
using the question formulation technique is,

00:22:10.280 --> 00:22:13.770 position:67%
it's automatic engagement for the
students, because they're interested in it,

00:22:13.770 --> 00:22:19.530 position:72%
they get to view their voice, their
opinions, their thoughts, and their questions.

00:22:19.530 --> 00:22:24.700 position:67%
&gt;&gt; So I hope you enjoyed that trailer, and
you can see the whole video on our website.

00:22:24.700 --> 00:22:30.960 position:56%
So let's take a look at the next
step of students sharing their work.

00:22:30.960 --> 00:22:33.560 position:72%
They can share the questions that they change.

00:22:33.560 --> 00:22:36.890
They learn from each other about
how they change the questions.

00:22:36.890 --> 00:22:40.040 position:56%
They share their priority questions.

00:22:40.040 --> 00:22:42.960 position:63%
And also they share the numbers of where

00:22:42.960 --> 00:22:47.380 position:56%
in their sequence original questions
did their priority questions fall.

00:22:47.380 --> 00:22:52.450 position:67%
So it's very interesting when they see
that, and I'll talk about that in a moment.

00:22:52.450 --> 00:22:57.280 position:63%
And then they share their rationale for
why they chose those priority questions.

00:22:57.280 --> 00:23:03.690 position:64%
And they can discuss and share their next
steps for working with their questions.

00:23:03.690 --> 00:23:06.470 position:64%
So then they go through all that process.

00:23:06.470 --> 00:23:11.540
And at the very end, there is
a piece, a part for reflection,

00:23:11.540 --> 00:23:15.650
where the students are asked,
what did you learn?

00:23:17.990 --> 00:23:22.450
How did you learn it?

00:23:22.450 --> 00:23:26.710
And what do you understand
differently now for you

00:23:26.710 --> 00:23:28.910
about students learning to
ask their own questions?

00:23:28.910 --> 00:23:31.710 position:64%
So that's a question that I have for you.

00:23:31.710 --> 00:23:40.290 position:70%
What do you understand differently now about
students learning to ask their own questions?

00:23:40.290 --> 00:23:46.100 position:72%
Take a moment and think about that, and then
I want to share with you some specific aspects

00:23:46.100 --> 00:23:57.310 position:58%
of the why and how the QFT the
question formulation technique works.

00:24:08.400 --> 00:24:14.970
Okay, let's take a look at some
specific aspects of the process.

00:24:14.970 --> 00:24:24.580 position:66%
We'll unpack the process and the outcomes.

00:24:24.580 --> 00:24:30.540 position:75%
In the question formulation technique, there are
actually 3 thinking abilities that are embedded

00:24:30.540 --> 00:24:36.090 position:73%
into one process, and this is part of the rigor
that is in the question formulation technique.

00:24:36.090 --> 00:24:43.530 position:69%
They're doing rigorous thinking, rigorous
work as they go through the different steps.

00:24:43.530 --> 00:24:49.540 position:75%
And they're not all blended together, they are
purposely separated so that they're able to work

00:24:49.540 --> 00:24:53.350
on each of these thinking
abilities at a specific time.

00:24:53.350 --> 00:24:54.950
So let's look at the first one.

00:24:54.950 --> 00:24:57.960
The students begin to think
in many different directions.

00:24:57.960 --> 00:24:59.370
They do divergent thinking.

00:24:59.370 --> 00:25:05.090 position:73%
So the 4 rules that we came up with, that we
told you took us 8 years to come up with them ,

00:25:05.090 --> 00:25:10.200 position:63%
are really trying to create that space
and the structure and the rigor for them

00:25:10.200 --> 00:25:13.740
to do more than, I've got
one question and no more.

00:25:13.740 --> 00:25:18.300 position:63%
And I'm sure many of you have seen this,
many teachers have talked about trying

00:25:18.300 --> 00:25:22.700 position:66%
to invite questions and get questions
from students can feel like pulling teeth.

00:25:22.700 --> 00:25:26.980
Or they'll get questions
from 1 or 2 or 3 students,

00:25:26.980 --> 00:25:29.570 position:64%
but they'll not hear from other students.

00:25:29.570 --> 00:25:33.370
So the idea of using those
rules is to create the structure

00:25:33.370 --> 00:25:35.640 position:59%
for students to do divergent thinking.

00:25:35.640 --> 00:25:42.660 position:73%
It's hard to do divergent thinking if you don't
have a process and a structure for doing that.

00:25:42.660 --> 00:25:46.440 position:59%
Then they move to a different kind of
thinking, narrowing down and focusing,

00:25:46.440 --> 00:25:49.030 position:58%
they begin to do convergent thinking.

00:25:49.030 --> 00:25:53.080 position:75%
And they do convergent thinking as they begin to
look at their open and closed-ended questions.

00:25:53.080 --> 00:25:55.140 position:58%
They begin to practice changing them.

00:25:55.140 --> 00:25:58.840
They are looking more carefully,
more closely at their questions.

00:25:58.840 --> 00:26:01.180 position:64%
And then they prioritize their questions.

00:26:01.180 --> 00:26:05.880 position:69%
And when they're prioritizing their
questions, they are continuing with the kind

00:26:05.880 --> 00:26:12.060 position:64%
of sophisticated convergent thinking that
should come after divergent thinking.

00:26:12.060 --> 00:26:14.150
So there's a sequence here.

00:26:14.150 --> 00:26:19.340 position:75%
Now there's one more thinking ability, that's a
very sophisticated thinking ability that's built

00:26:19.340 --> 00:26:22.620 position:63%
into the question formulation technique.

00:26:22.620 --> 00:26:26.810
And it's thinking about thinking,
metacognitive thinking.

00:26:26.810 --> 00:26:31.600 position:75%
And there are several steps in that process
that students are thinking about their thinking.

00:26:31.600 --> 00:26:34.940
Beginning with when they're
asked, what might be different

00:26:34.940 --> 00:26:37.480
about following the 4 rules
for producing questions.

00:26:37.480 --> 00:26:40.990 position:69%
They have to think about how do they usually
operate, and what's different about it,

00:26:40.990 --> 00:26:44.930 position:58%
what are the rules require of them in
their thinking and working process.

00:26:44.930 --> 00:26:47.610
They have to think about
advantages and disadvantages

00:26:47.610 --> 00:26:49.410
of open and closed-ended questions.

00:26:49.410 --> 00:26:53.900
They have to think about why they
chose their priority questions,

00:26:53.900 --> 00:26:55.980
what's their rationale for that.

00:26:55.980 --> 00:26:59.610
And then, even when they see
the sequence of questions,

00:26:59.610 --> 00:27:03.650 position:66%
very often they notice they might have a
priority question from the first grouping,

00:27:03.650 --> 00:27:05.370
something from the middle,
something from the end.

00:27:05.370 --> 00:27:09.640 position:67%
And they realize that one of their priority
questions didn't come until the end.

00:27:09.640 --> 00:27:15.870 position:75%
And so they got to see the value of working with
their questions to advance their own thinking.

00:27:15.870 --> 00:27:21.630 position:64%
So what happens, what do the teachers see
when students go through this process?

00:27:21.630 --> 00:27:24.800
They see students who are
more curious and engaged.

00:27:24.800 --> 00:27:31.080 position:61%
We take greater ownership and are more
confident working with primary sources.

00:27:31.080 --> 00:27:36.850 position:73%
Which, instead of it being intimidating,
unfamiliar, and difficult, it becomes something

00:27:36.850 --> 00:27:41.040 position:59%
that they are looking at very, very
carefully, and they have their own set

00:27:41.040 --> 00:27:43.780
of questions now to look at that.

00:27:43.780 --> 00:27:45.840
And what do students say?

00:27:45.840 --> 00:27:52.870 position:63%
Students say many different things about
how they are learning this process.

00:27:52.870 --> 00:27:56.050
Here's a sixth grader in Palo
Alto, California, who said,

00:27:56.050 --> 00:27:59.500 position:59%
just when you think you know all you
need to know, you ask another question

00:27:59.500 --> 00:28:03.850 position:70%
and discover how much more there is to learn.

00:28:03.850 --> 00:28:10.120 position:66%
And then think about this statement from
a high school student in Boston, who said,

00:28:10.120 --> 00:28:14.270 position:58%
when you ask the question, you feel
like it's your job to get the answer.

00:28:14.270 --> 00:28:16.760
Just think about that, think
about the feeling for you,

00:28:16.760 --> 00:28:18.570 position:64%
think about the feeling for that student.

00:28:18.570 --> 00:28:24.460 position:70%
It's not their job to give you the answer to
your question, they've set a learning agenda,

00:28:24.460 --> 00:28:30.100 position:75%
they feel like it's their job to get the answer.

00:28:30.100 --> 00:28:32.260 position:70%
And look at this one last student reflection.

00:28:32.260 --> 00:28:34.480 position:58%
This is a ninth grade student who was

00:28:34.480 --> 00:28:38.560
in a remedial summer school
program at risk of being held back.

00:28:38.560 --> 00:28:45.000 position:56%
And when asked what he had learned
by learning to ask his own questions

00:28:45.000 --> 00:28:49.470
in the summer school program, said,
the way it made me feel was smart,

00:28:49.470 --> 00:28:53.450
because I was asking good
questions and giving good answers.

00:28:53.450 --> 00:28:58.590 position:59%
So if you think back to those charts
at the beginning of this presentation,

00:28:58.590 --> 00:29:04.350 position:67%
and you think about what we talked about
in terms of the pressure to get to answers,

00:29:04.350 --> 00:29:09.280
the students discover that by
learning to ask good questions,

00:29:09.280 --> 00:29:11.420 position:61%
by learning to ask their own questions,

00:29:11.420 --> 00:29:15.940 position:56%
by working with their own questions,
they can get to good answers.

00:29:15.940 --> 00:29:22.250 position:67%
And that adjective that he used to describe
himself, smart, is a very significant one

00:29:22.250 --> 00:29:26.930
for a student who was in the summer
school program that he was in.

00:29:26.930 --> 00:29:30.420
So those are the kinds of
changes that you see in students.

00:29:30.420 --> 00:29:31.980
Here's a reflection from a teacher.

00:29:31.980 --> 00:29:36.570 position:72%
This is the third grade teacher, Maureen
Bennet, in Lexington, Massachusetts, who said,

00:29:36.570 --> 00:29:40.390
the question formulation technique
was a great segueway into the unit.

00:29:40.390 --> 00:29:43.950 position:59%
I noticed that the students were fully
engaged and excited to try to figure

00:29:43.950 --> 00:29:46.630 position:58%
out what this document was all about.

00:29:46.630 --> 00:29:49.790 position:56%
Having them generate their own
questions about this made the lesson

00:29:49.790 --> 00:29:53.540 position:61%
so much more powerful than ever before.

00:29:54.790 --> 00:30:01.060
So let's take a final look at the
question formulation technique

00:30:01.060 --> 00:30:09.060 position:73%
and its universal relevance across disciplines,
grade levels, subject areas, and communities.

00:30:09.060 --> 00:30:13.390
So the research confirms the
importance of student questioning.

00:30:13.390 --> 00:30:17.710 position:61%
John Haddi talks about self-questioning
as the metacognitive strategy,

00:30:17.710 --> 00:30:19.840
that students formulating
their own questions prove

00:30:19.840 --> 00:30:23.110
to be one the most effective
metacognitive strategies.

00:30:23.110 --> 00:30:30.090 position:75%
Engaging in pre-lesson self-questioning improves
student's rate of learning by nearly 50%.

00:30:30.090 --> 00:30:33.740 position:56%
And here's this wonderful quote from
the historian David Hackett Fischer.

00:30:33.740 --> 00:30:40.450 position:67%
We talked about how questions are the
engines of intellect, the cerebral machines

00:30:40.450 --> 00:30:45.610
which convert energy to motion,
and curiosity to control inquiry.

00:30:45.610 --> 00:30:49.100
He wrote this way back in 1971.

00:30:49.100 --> 00:30:54.840 position:63%
And I love how it captures what students
are now doing all around the country

00:30:54.840 --> 00:30:58.640
and all around the world as they're
converting that energy into motion,

00:30:58.640 --> 00:31:01.080 position:56%
into action, into a research agenda.

00:31:01.080 --> 00:31:07.620 position:67%
They're converting that curiosity to a very
disciplined rigorous controlled inquiry.

00:31:07.620 --> 00:31:11.490
So I love how that quote
in a sense anticipates much

00:31:11.490 --> 00:31:17.390 position:58%
of what we're now seeing all students
being able to do on their own.

00:31:17.390 --> 00:31:21.110
Now, let's take a moment
and look at the importance

00:31:21.110 --> 00:31:23.880 position:70%
of students working with their own questions.

00:31:23.880 --> 00:31:26.110
So there's a little note
there about at the bottom,

00:31:26.110 --> 00:31:30.420
this was a subliminal message
that I'm making explicit now.

00:31:30.420 --> 00:31:36.010
This was a photo shot that I used
at the beginning of the process

00:31:36.010 --> 00:31:40.070 position:59%
of the question formulation
technique, and you see a student there

00:31:40.070 --> 00:31:43.790 position:64%
with marker in hand, writing and working.

00:31:43.790 --> 00:31:49.060
Another student looking at the list
and pointing, making discussions.

00:31:49.060 --> 00:31:53.480
You can see where they've marked
some questions with an O for open.

00:31:53.480 --> 00:31:59.510 position:66%
So you see that kind of work, it's
students working with their own questions.

00:31:59.510 --> 00:32:03.630
And when they do that, it
becomes a transformative skill.

00:32:03.630 --> 00:32:08.440 position:59%
We believe it's a foundational skill
that should be taught to all students,

00:32:08.440 --> 00:32:11.930 position:59%
and it is also a transformative skill.

00:32:11.930 --> 00:32:15.930
Allow students to go from confusion
to a clear learning agenda.

00:32:15.930 --> 00:32:18.590 position:72%
It allows them to move towards better answers.

00:32:18.590 --> 00:32:26.870 position:69%
It increases engagement and ownership, and
allows for genuine inquiry in the classroom.

00:32:26.870 --> 00:32:32.120 position:75%
And not to be forgotten is what teachers report,

00:32:32.120 --> 00:32:36.640
is that it provides a little more
joy in a very demanding profession.

00:32:36.640 --> 00:32:43.700 position:73%
When you see your students really excited about
their own questions and their learning agenda.

00:32:43.700 --> 00:32:47.500
And then is one more reason for
us to think about the importance

00:32:47.500 --> 00:32:50.390 position:67%
of teaching the skill question formulation.

00:32:53.020 --> 00:32:53.660
Democracy.

00:32:53.660 --> 00:33:00.680 position:64%
The woman seated in the center of the
picture there, seated at the table there,

00:33:00.680 --> 00:33:04.540
is Septima Clark, one of the great
educators of the 20th century,

00:33:04.540 --> 00:33:08.500
great relatively unknown
educators of the 20th century.

00:33:08.500 --> 00:33:15.240 position:73%
Who in 1955, was fired by the Charleston, South
Carolina Board of Education after 18 years

00:33:15.240 --> 00:33:20.070
of teaching because she was
a member of the NAACP.

00:33:20.070 --> 00:33:24.620 position:63%
So she and her cousin, Bernice Robinson,
who is standing behind her there,

00:33:24.620 --> 00:33:29.870 position:56%
organized citizenship schools, in
which they organized to teach adults

00:33:29.870 --> 00:33:34.690 position:61%
in the community basic literacy skills
so they could learn to help themselves,

00:33:34.690 --> 00:33:39.580
not get cheated out of wages,
and begin to prepare

00:33:39.580 --> 00:33:44.050 position:56%
for a larger agenda of participating
in democracy.

00:33:44.050 --> 00:33:49.370
And that's really the opportunity
that we all have when we're sharing

00:33:49.370 --> 00:33:54.480 position:70%
and teaching the skill question
formulation, is we're building civic capacity

00:33:54.480 --> 00:33:58.040 position:63%
through a foundational democratic skill.

00:33:58.040 --> 00:34:02.330
It's possible to imagine a
dictatorship without questions,

00:34:02.330 --> 00:34:05.010 position:70%
without citizens being able to ask questions.

00:34:05.010 --> 00:34:09.140
But it's not possible to imagine
a democracy without questions.

00:34:09.140 --> 00:34:14.670
And so we are delighted to share
the question formulation technique.

00:34:14.670 --> 00:34:19.760 position:69%
Delighted the opportunity we've had to work
with teaching primary sources at the Library

00:34:19.760 --> 00:34:24.580
of Congress with our partners at C3
and the social studies framework,

00:34:24.580 --> 00:34:28.370
to be working with teachers
and educators in all areas

00:34:28.370 --> 00:34:32.370 position:61%
to help build this fundamental learning
skill, this fundamental thinking skill,

00:34:32.370 --> 00:34:37.430
a fundamental life skill, and
a fundamental democratic skill.

00:34:37.430 --> 00:34:42.130
So thank you all very much, and
I look forward to our discussion.

00:34:42.130 --> 00:34:49.060 position:70%
Keep in mind Septima Clark's words, we need
to be taught to study rather than to believe,

00:34:49.060 --> 00:34:53.360
to inquire rather than to affirm.

00:34:53.360 --> 00:34:59.080 position:73%
And I want to thank Josh Bier and his class,
at the Goshen-Lempster School in New Hampshire.

00:34:59.080 --> 00:35:05.430 position:70%
You can see an educational leadership article
that has more about his work and teachers

00:35:05.430 --> 00:35:09.800 position:72%
in other parts of the country, and you can
access the full video that was previewed here.

00:35:09.800 --> 00:35:13.790
And thank you to our team here
at the Right Question Institute

00:35:13.790 --> 00:35:17.470 position:59%
who helped make this session possible.

00:35:17.470 --> 00:35:21.030
And as I mentioned earlier, there
are more resources available

00:35:21.030 --> 00:35:24.920
on the question formulation
technique at the RightQuestion.org.

00:35:24.920 --> 00:35:29.210
So I look forward to your
questions and the discussion.

00:35:31.690 --> 00:35:33.000
&gt;&gt; Fantastic, Dan.

00:35:33.000 --> 00:35:34.060
This is Cheryl again.

00:35:34.060 --> 00:35:36.230
I've been harvesting questions.

00:35:36.230 --> 00:35:48.200 position:73%
And the first one has to do with how teachers
manage the time that this technique might take.

00:35:48.200 --> 00:35:53.430 position:75%
&gt;&gt; Okay, that's a common question and a concern.

00:35:53.430 --> 00:35:58.890
The very first time that you use
the question formulation technique,

00:35:58.890 --> 00:36:02.680 position:59%
it is something where you actually are
having the students discuss the rules,

00:36:02.680 --> 00:36:05.980
think about them, discuss
advantages and disadvantages.

00:36:05.980 --> 00:36:11.080
So if you give them -- you
can do this in 35, 40 minutes.

00:36:11.080 --> 00:36:16.150 position:64%
You can do this in a class in one class
hour, depending on how much time you want

00:36:16.150 --> 00:36:18.580 position:63%
to give them doing work in small groups.

00:36:18.580 --> 00:36:25.610 position:72%
But once they learn this, it becomes something
that becomes part of second nature for them.

00:36:25.610 --> 00:36:28.560 position:66%
They know they're able to do this quickly.

00:36:28.560 --> 00:36:30.550
You can get it done in 10 minutes.

00:36:30.550 --> 00:36:36.540 position:75%
You can get it done as a do now at the beginning
of a class, where you present a question focus

00:36:36.540 --> 00:36:40.260 position:63%
and the students at the beginning are
actually generating their own questions.

00:36:40.260 --> 00:36:41.930 position:61%
You can do it as a homework assignment.

00:36:41.930 --> 00:36:43.850 position:67%
Students learn how to do this on their own.

00:36:43.850 --> 00:36:49.570 position:61%
So you are developing the skill, you're
giving them different opportunities

00:36:49.570 --> 00:36:51.830
to continue to practice the skill.

00:36:51.830 --> 00:36:54.160
And like any skill, it's
something that you get better

00:36:54.160 --> 00:36:56.650
at the more you practice, and
you can do it more quickly.

00:36:56.650 --> 00:37:03.040 position:69%
So yes, there is a commitment the very first
time did you do it, but then you modify it

00:37:03.040 --> 00:37:07.480 position:66%
so that you don't have full discussions of
all the different aspects of the process,

00:37:07.480 --> 00:37:12.950 position:64%
and they just get to work on asking their
questions, changing them, prioritizing,

00:37:12.950 --> 00:37:16.520
and planning on next steps
what they're going to do.

00:37:18.020 --> 00:37:20.550 position:70%
&gt;&gt; Thank you, that's a really helpful answer.

00:37:20.550 --> 00:37:26.720
Along the same lines, somebody
asked how she can meet her goals

00:37:26.720 --> 00:37:29.050 position:69%
when the students are forming the questions.

00:37:29.050 --> 00:37:33.350 position:72%
What are your experiences around that, please?

00:37:33.350 --> 00:37:36.830 position:75%
&gt;&gt; Right, that's also very important to address.

00:37:36.830 --> 00:37:40.320
Which is, we weren't able
to fully get into this year.

00:37:40.320 --> 00:37:45.040
But when you design the question
focus, you're designing it

00:37:45.040 --> 00:37:49.470 position:75%
with the content that you need to teach in mind.

00:37:49.470 --> 00:37:55.560 position:73%
When you are designing the prioritization
instructions, you're doing it with the teaching

00:37:55.560 --> 00:37:57.580 position:64%
and learning goals that you have in mind,

00:37:57.580 --> 00:38:00.040
including the specific things
the students will be doing.

00:38:00.040 --> 00:38:05.620 position:70%
So that's why if you think about the teachers
chose a question focus that was related

00:38:05.620 --> 00:38:09.830
to what they needed to teach,
what needed to be covered.

00:38:09.830 --> 00:38:12.290 position:56%
When they chose their prioritization
instructions,

00:38:12.290 --> 00:38:17.080 position:64%
it was based on what do they now want
students after they've done this thinking

00:38:17.080 --> 00:38:23.760 position:73%
about this topic, what do we want to be zeroing
in on to be prioritizing so that when they move

00:38:23.760 --> 00:38:27.630 position:69%
into the next steps, it's going to be
connected to what I'm teaching and learning.

00:38:27.630 --> 00:38:33.330 position:66%
So it's not disconnected from that, it's
actually shaped by what you need to teach.

00:38:36.570 --> 00:38:37.860
&gt;&gt; Terrific.

00:38:37.860 --> 00:38:44.210 position:66%
So along the same lines, Dan, I'm
wondering what you've encountered in terms

00:38:44.210 --> 00:38:49.630 position:56%
of teachers regarding this is a
shift in practice, and particularly,

00:38:49.630 --> 00:38:53.920 position:61%
I've been wondering how it differs from
other approaches to student questioning

00:38:53.920 --> 00:39:00.520 position:67%
where teachers might provide question
stems and really shape that more carefully.

00:39:00.520 --> 00:39:02.920 position:56%
This technique seems much more open.

00:39:02.920 --> 00:39:06.180 position:59%
&gt;&gt; Right, well, it's very interesting.

00:39:06.180 --> 00:39:13.180 position:61%
This is a deceptively simple technique,
and it's also deceptively open.

00:39:13.180 --> 00:39:18.260 position:58%
Because there's actually a very
rigorous structure here that you work

00:39:18.260 --> 00:39:23.040
with that structure, in a sense,
there's the art and the science

00:39:23.040 --> 00:39:24.810 position:59%
of the question formulation technique.

00:39:24.810 --> 00:39:31.530 position:75%
Not saying that we discuss at length in our book
make just one change, but the shorthand version

00:39:31.530 --> 00:39:41.850 position:59%
of it here is that you are able to
basically take what you need to cover,

00:39:41.850 --> 00:39:48.960 position:66%
and you design it in a way so that they're
able to zero in on the on the key topics

00:39:48.960 --> 00:39:52.390 position:67%
and on what they need to be thinking about.

00:39:52.390 --> 00:39:56.800 position:73%
So I'm not sure if that answered your question.

00:40:00.250 --> 00:40:03.790 position:59%
&gt;&gt; It certainly gives me lots to think
about, and I'm going to turn this

00:40:03.790 --> 00:40:07.940 position:69%
out to the participants and say, if you have
questions around this, go ahead and put them

00:40:07.940 --> 00:40:12.150
in the chat box and we'll
catch as many as we can.

00:40:12.150 --> 00:40:21.800 position:67%
So, Dan, how widely has this technique been
implemented if I'm not necessarily looking

00:40:21.800 --> 00:40:27.190
for an exact number, but
how widely is it being used?

00:40:27.190 --> 00:40:33.590 position:61%
And did you have any surprises when you
took it into a school or a district?

00:40:34.650 --> 00:40:40.610 position:69%
&gt;&gt; Well, I think that we've been inspired
by just seeing how teachers have been hungry

00:40:40.610 --> 00:40:46.370 position:70%
for this, this is the dream of many teachers
to see their students working with questions,

00:40:46.370 --> 00:40:49.480 position:69%
asking questions, engaged, taking ownership.

00:40:49.480 --> 00:40:51.990 position:58%
So it's been a very exciting process.

00:40:51.990 --> 00:40:56.100
I have to share with you
all a little kind of secret.

00:40:56.100 --> 00:40:59.780 position:58%
That when we were asked to write the
book because there were some examples

00:40:59.780 --> 00:41:04.500
of teachers using it, we barely
had 5 stories, full stories,

00:41:04.500 --> 00:41:08.250 position:75%
of teachers around the country using the
question formulation technique in the classroom,

00:41:08.250 --> 00:41:14.340 position:69%
and one of whom was my daughter, who was in
her first year of teaching in New York City.

00:41:14.340 --> 00:41:18.260 position:73%
So maybe that invalidated the pool even
further, I'm not sure, although some people say

00:41:18.260 --> 00:41:23.100 position:67%
that might've actually validated the
technique even more, don't know about that.

00:41:23.100 --> 00:41:26.820 position:69%
But we were able to put the stories together

00:41:26.820 --> 00:41:31.290 position:66%
and illustrate how do you use the question
formulation technique, and since then,

00:41:31.290 --> 00:41:34.120 position:59%
it's been an educator-driven movement.

00:41:34.120 --> 00:41:38.090
And that's what's really been
one surprising and wonderful.

00:41:38.090 --> 00:41:42.860 position:58%
And we've seen the kind of initiative
that's been taken by people who pick

00:41:42.860 --> 00:41:45.340 position:66%
up on this and find ways to bring this in.

00:41:45.340 --> 00:41:50.570 position:70%
So with teaching of primary sources, you have
Mary Johnson's work, who tweeted about this,

00:41:50.570 --> 00:41:51.930
and we connected through twitter.

00:41:51.930 --> 00:41:54.510 position:72%
And the next thing we know, we were doing work

00:41:54.510 --> 00:41:56.870
with the Western region of
teaching the primary sources.

00:41:56.870 --> 00:41:59.220
And since then, they've brought
it to more people

00:41:59.220 --> 00:42:02.210 position:67%
within your network and around the country.

00:42:02.210 --> 00:42:05.140
And that's what we see community
after community.

00:42:05.140 --> 00:42:11.040 position:69%
And what's also really exciting is that it's
being used across all kinds of communities,

00:42:11.040 --> 00:42:15.720
urban, suburban, rural, elementary,
middle, high school, and higher ed.

00:42:15.720 --> 00:42:20.370
I just came back from a meeting
today at Harvard Medical School,

00:42:20.370 --> 00:42:27.680 position:73%
where I gave a keynote address last year on
the art and science of asking better questions.

00:42:27.680 --> 00:42:31.190 position:63%
And there's a recognition at the medical
school that their students are very good

00:42:31.190 --> 00:42:36.650 position:64%
at answering questions, but they need to
get better at asking their own questions.

00:42:36.650 --> 00:42:42.560 position:66%
So there's just a lot of excitement among
educators that inspires us to keep moving.

00:42:42.560 --> 00:42:50.480 position:73%
&gt;&gt; Sounds like this has huge ramifications, and
I'm seeing a lot of excitement in the chat too.

00:42:50.480 --> 00:42:55.540 position:63%
One of the questions that just came in,
and Andrew nodded toward it in the chat,

00:42:55.540 --> 00:42:58.720
but maybe you can expand
on this just a little bit.

00:42:58.720 --> 00:43:05.110 position:69%
And we we're running close on time, so
we'll see if we get any questions past this.

00:43:05.110 --> 00:43:08.760
Do you have any research or
examples of kindergartners

00:43:08.760 --> 00:43:12.790 position:59%
or first-graders using this technique?

00:43:12.790 --> 00:43:20.170 position:56%
&gt;&gt; yes. And there are some wonderful
examples of teachers using it.

00:43:20.170 --> 00:43:26.000 position:67%
And actually, on our blog post, which I
think our blog, which Andrew just mentioned

00:43:26.000 --> 00:43:30.910
in the chat, there are examples
of a first-grade teacher who wrote

00:43:30.910 --> 00:43:36.110 position:70%
about using the question formulation
technique in his class with examples of that.

00:43:36.110 --> 00:43:39.290 position:64%
There are teachers around the country who
are doing that who are tweeting about it.

00:43:39.290 --> 00:43:42.050 position:61%
So there are a lot of examples of that.

00:43:42.050 --> 00:43:45.630 position:63%
&gt;&gt; I will get that link to the blog out.

00:43:45.630 --> 00:43:46.900
We're working on that.

00:43:46.900 --> 00:43:51.440 position:73%
So we want to move into the wrapping up pieces.

00:43:51.440 --> 00:43:55.790
Thanks, Andrew, for putting
that link to the blog.

00:43:55.790 --> 00:44:00.000 position:66%
We want to thank everybody for joining us.

00:44:00.000 --> 00:44:06.000 position:59%
We will be in communication via email
within 5 business days with directions

00:44:06.000 --> 00:44:08.800
on how to access your certificate.

00:44:08.800 --> 00:44:14.390
I want to thank you all so much
for participating, for joining,

00:44:14.390 --> 00:44:18.500
for your energy, your enthusiasm,
your questions.

00:44:18.500 --> 00:44:24.480
And we are going to end the
recording and the session now.

00:44:24.480 --> 00:44:25.750
Thank you so much.

00:44:25.750 --> 00:44:31.570
&gt;&gt; This has been a presentation
of the Library of Congress.
