00:00:00.747 --> 00:00:02.176
- [Instructor] What we're
going to do in this video

00:00:02.176 --> 00:00:06.793
is get some practice evaluating
exponents of decimals.

00:00:06.793 --> 00:00:10.793
So let's say that I have
0.2 to the third power.

00:00:13.316 --> 00:00:14.698
Pause this video, see
if you can figure out

00:00:14.698 --> 00:00:17.206
what that is going to be.

00:00:17.206 --> 00:00:19.376
Well, this would just mean
that if I take something

00:00:19.376 --> 00:00:22.118
to the third power, that means
I take three of that number

00:00:22.118 --> 00:00:23.771
and I multiply them together.

00:00:23.771 --> 00:00:26.438
So it's 0.2 times 0.2 times 0.2.

00:00:31.213 --> 00:00:33.376
Well, what is this going to be equal to?

00:00:33.376 --> 00:00:37.543
Well, if I take 0.2 times
0.2, that is going to be 0.04.

00:00:41.068 --> 00:00:44.243
One way to think about
it, two times two is four

00:00:44.243 --> 00:00:46.723
and then I have one
number behind the decimal

00:00:46.723 --> 00:00:47.781
to the right of the decimal here.

00:00:47.781 --> 00:00:49.782
I have another digit to
the right of the decimal

00:00:49.782 --> 00:00:53.316
right over here, so my product
is going to have two digits

00:00:53.316 --> 00:00:56.518
to the right of the
decimal, so it'd be 0.04.

00:00:56.518 --> 00:01:00.653
And then if I were to
multiply that times 0.2,

00:01:00.653 --> 00:01:02.751
so if I were to multiply that together

00:01:02.751 --> 00:01:04.172
what is that going to be equal to?

00:01:04.172 --> 00:01:07.339
Well, four times two is equal to eight

00:01:08.256 --> 00:01:11.423
and now I have one, two, three numbers

00:01:12.625 --> 00:01:14.243
to the right of the decimal point,

00:01:14.243 --> 00:01:18.853
so my product is going to
have one, two, three numbers

00:01:18.853 --> 00:01:21.448
to the right of the decimal point.

00:01:21.448 --> 00:01:23.831
So now that we've had a little
bit of practice with that,

00:01:23.831 --> 00:01:26.077
let's do another example.

00:01:26.077 --> 00:01:30.244
So let's say that I were to
ask you, what is 0.9 squared?

00:01:36.464 --> 00:01:40.279
Pause this video and see
if you can figure that out.

00:01:40.279 --> 00:01:44.446
All right, well this is just
going to be 0.9 times 0.9.

00:01:46.688 --> 00:01:48.533
And what's that going to be equal to?

00:01:48.533 --> 00:01:51.176
Well, you could just say nine times nine

00:01:51.176 --> 00:01:55.412
is going to be equal to
81, and so, let's see,

00:01:55.412 --> 00:01:57.401
in the two numbers that I'm multiplying

00:01:57.401 --> 00:02:01.277
I have a total of one, two
numbers, or two digits,

00:02:01.277 --> 00:02:03.059
to the right of the decimal point

00:02:03.059 --> 00:02:06.279
so my answer's going
to have one, two digits

00:02:06.279 --> 00:02:07.678
to the right of the decimal point.

00:02:07.678 --> 00:02:09.518
So put the decimal right over there

00:02:09.518 --> 00:02:11.904
and I'll put the zero, so 0.81.

00:02:11.904 --> 00:02:15.139
Another way to think about it
is nine-tenths of nine-tenths

00:02:15.139 --> 00:02:18.812
is 81 hundredths, but there you go.

00:02:18.812 --> 00:02:22.612
Using exponents, or taking
exponents of decimals

00:02:22.612 --> 00:02:25.141
is the same as when we're
taking it of integers.

00:02:25.141 --> 00:02:27.188
It's just in this case you just have to

00:02:27.188 --> 00:02:30.345
do a little bit of decimal multiplication.
