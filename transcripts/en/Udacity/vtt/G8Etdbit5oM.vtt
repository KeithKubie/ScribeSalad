00:00:00.120 --> 00:00:00.990
What do you think, David?

00:00:00.990 --> 00:00:02.235
This is provable.

00:00:02.235 --> 00:00:02.830
&gt;&gt; Some said that no,

00:00:02.830 --> 00:00:05.870
based on the knowledge that we're
given here about the mug, a pot, and

00:00:05.870 --> 00:00:08.590
an object, and
the things that we know from the past,

00:00:08.590 --> 00:00:11.400
we can't actually prove
that this object is a mug.

00:00:11.400 --> 00:00:13.710
We can prove that the object is stable,
and

00:00:13.710 --> 00:00:16.910
enables drinking based on what we
saw with the proof of the cup.

00:00:16.910 --> 00:00:18.250
The object we're dealing with here,

00:00:18.250 --> 00:00:22.170
had all the same criteria as our object
in the other example in addition.

00:00:22.170 --> 00:00:24.530
To these thick sides,
and being made of clay.

00:00:24.530 --> 00:00:25.690
So because we had everything else,

00:00:25.690 --> 00:00:29.570
we were able to easily prove that
it's stable and enables drinking.

00:00:29.570 --> 00:00:33.000
But what we can't do is we
can't link protecting its heat

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:34.620
to limiting heat transfer.

00:00:34.620 --> 00:00:37.500
Nothing in my definition of pot
actually tells me that the fact that it

00:00:37.500 --> 00:00:39.960
limits heat transfer actually
protects against heat.

00:00:39.960 --> 00:00:43.450
So, while for my definition of
pot I can abstract that because

00:00:43.450 --> 00:00:47.590
my new object has thick sides and is
made of clay, it limits heat transfer,

00:00:47.590 --> 00:00:50.910
I can't make that last connection
to protecting against heat.

00:00:50.910 --> 00:00:52.170
&gt;&gt; That is good David.

00:00:52.170 --> 00:00:55.180
Now let's make sure that we understand
the processing that David did.

00:00:55.180 --> 00:00:57.180
He wanted to show that
the object is a mug.

00:00:57.180 --> 00:00:59.820
So he looked at the conditions,
the open conditions of

00:00:59.820 --> 00:01:02.770
proving that the object is a mug,
and there were three of them.

00:01:02.770 --> 00:01:05.040
For each of them,
he tried to build a proof.

00:01:05.040 --> 00:01:08.920
He could do so for the first two,
but this was the open one.

00:01:08.920 --> 00:01:11.560
So he came up with the closest example,
that was the pot.

00:01:11.560 --> 00:01:14.850
And he did the abstraction here, but
he was unable to link these two,

00:01:14.850 --> 00:01:17.690
because there is no knowledge which
links these two at the present time.
