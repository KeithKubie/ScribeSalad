(wind rushing)
(mouse clicking)

00:00:01.216 --> 00:00:04.383
(electronics beeping)

00:00:09.110 --> 00:00:11.630
- Special education services
in the San Francisco

00:00:12.650 --> 00:00:14.910
Unified School District.

00:00:14.910 --> 00:00:17.460
She brings much expertise as a principal

00:00:17.460 --> 00:00:20.850
as well as the central
office administrator

00:00:20.850 --> 00:00:23.690
in the role of special
education supervisor.

00:00:23.690 --> 00:00:26.870
And we're looking forward
to hearing Jean's talk.

00:00:26.870 --> 00:00:31.500
Thank you, Jean.
(audience applauding)

00:00:31.500 --> 00:00:33.633
- Hi everybody, wow.

00:00:35.120 --> 00:00:36.455
I loved your talk.

00:00:36.455 --> 00:00:38.860
I think I could have sat
and listened to it all day

00:00:38.860 --> 00:00:43.860
because there are so many things
that we're doing together.

00:00:45.400 --> 00:00:47.840
Although my office is
way out at the beach.

00:00:47.840 --> 00:00:50.770
I'm at Santiago and 42nd, but we're doing

00:00:50.770 --> 00:00:54.150
a lot of similar work for
the city of San Francisco,

00:00:54.150 --> 00:00:55.540
which is exciting.

00:00:55.540 --> 00:00:59.830
So this is my very first
keynote ever in my whole life.

00:00:59.830 --> 00:01:02.000
I want you to know that.

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:05.760
So you're going to have
to bear with me, OK?

00:01:05.760 --> 00:01:08.990
So my talk this morning is starting

00:01:08.990 --> 00:01:10.190
with special education.

00:01:10.190 --> 00:01:14.160
I was asked to come here
and basically give you

00:01:14.160 --> 00:01:17.960
special education 101, sort
of what we can do together

00:01:17.960 --> 00:01:21.520
and how you can access
and help your patients

00:01:21.520 --> 00:01:23.440
access special education.

00:01:23.440 --> 00:01:25.150
So I don't have videos.

00:01:25.150 --> 00:01:27.800
I have a little bit of story telling,

00:01:27.800 --> 00:01:30.020
but it's going to be somewhat basic

00:01:30.020 --> 00:01:32.100
because that's what I was asked to do.

00:01:32.100 --> 00:01:34.700
I would be happy to come back another time

00:01:34.700 --> 00:01:39.700
and really let 'er rip from
my experiences in my career

00:01:40.900 --> 00:01:43.210
in working with kids with special needs.

00:01:43.210 --> 00:01:44.900
So we're starting with special education.

00:01:44.900 --> 00:01:49.010
My name is Jean Roberson, I
am the relatively new chief

00:01:49.010 --> 00:01:51.290
of special education.

00:01:51.290 --> 00:01:55.000
I just had my one-year
anniversary two weeks ago.

00:01:55.000 --> 00:01:58.770
And my entire career has
been here in San Francisco.

00:01:58.770 --> 00:02:03.480
And I have had 20, I think,
oh gosh, I don't know,

00:02:03.480 --> 00:02:07.163
26 years in San Francisco
Unified School district.

00:02:08.730 --> 00:02:12.860
The disclosure page, yeah,
I'm just skip over this

00:02:12.860 --> 00:02:14.790
if that's OK with you.

00:02:14.790 --> 00:02:18.330
I did what they told me to do.
(audience laughing)

00:02:18.330 --> 00:02:21.080
All right, moving on to my overview.

00:02:21.080 --> 00:02:23.640
So what I did for the overview is just

00:02:23.640 --> 00:02:28.640
to capture San Francisco's
overall vision and mission,

00:02:28.810 --> 00:02:33.280
which this is actually our
Special Education Department's

00:02:33.280 --> 00:02:36.130
vision where we provide
services and support

00:02:36.130 --> 00:02:39.700
for our students with
disabilities and their families

00:02:39.700 --> 00:02:43.070
that are characterized by quality, equity,

00:02:43.070 --> 00:02:46.560
positive in-school and
post-school outcomes.

00:02:46.560 --> 00:02:49.340
The department is led by me, the chief,

00:02:49.340 --> 00:02:51.900
and is responsible for early intervention

00:02:51.900 --> 00:02:55.360
for infants and toddlers,
pre-school for students

00:02:55.360 --> 00:02:58.339
starting at age three, services
for school age children

00:02:58.339 --> 00:03:02.170
in grades K through 12,
and transition services

00:03:02.170 --> 00:03:05.537
for eligible students up to the age of 22.

00:03:05.537 --> 00:03:08.230
And Chief Scott just told
me that his son graduated

00:03:08.230 --> 00:03:11.660
from the access program
just at midyear this year,

00:03:11.660 --> 00:03:15.030
so congratulations to your graduate.

00:03:15.030 --> 00:03:16.640
So our learning objectives today.

00:03:16.640 --> 00:03:17.630
I had to think good and hard

00:03:17.630 --> 00:03:19.830
about what I wanted you to leave with.

00:03:19.830 --> 00:03:23.420
And so I decided that the brief
description was important.

00:03:23.420 --> 00:03:27.410
And it's vital that we
each understand our role

00:03:27.410 --> 00:03:32.370
in Child Find, what the
assessment process is,

00:03:32.370 --> 00:03:36.250
what an IEP really looks
like, and when things

00:03:36.250 --> 00:03:37.980
when we're a little bit in disagreement

00:03:37.980 --> 00:03:42.980
what the alternatives are to come together

00:03:43.050 --> 00:03:44.850
and get through our disputes.

00:03:44.850 --> 00:03:46.800
And so we call it the ADR,

00:03:46.800 --> 00:03:49.140
the Alternative Dispute Resolution.

00:03:49.140 --> 00:03:52.640
And that's prior to the smackdown

00:03:52.640 --> 00:03:54.680
when you have to go to
the California Department

00:03:54.680 --> 00:03:56.940
of Education or make an OCR complaint,

00:03:56.940 --> 00:03:58.810
which is the Office of Civil Rights

00:03:58.810 --> 00:04:03.420
if your child's or your patient's
rights are being denied.

00:04:03.420 --> 00:04:05.919
I would hope that we could
come together before that

00:04:05.919 --> 00:04:09.090
and work through whatever
the issues are together.

00:04:09.090 --> 00:04:11.330
That's always been my goal, anyway.

00:04:11.330 --> 00:04:13.130
I want you to understand
the lay of the land

00:04:13.130 --> 00:04:15.370
of what's happening at
the school site level.

00:04:15.370 --> 00:04:17.723
We have over 120 schools
in the school district,

00:04:17.723 --> 00:04:21.620
and the schools are at different
levels of understanding

00:04:21.620 --> 00:04:25.250
and implementation of the
laws around special education,

00:04:25.250 --> 00:04:28.360
and it has to do with how
I like to use the word woke

00:04:28.360 --> 00:04:30.668
our principals are, the
principals are in charge

00:04:30.668 --> 00:04:33.610
of all things at their schools.

00:04:33.610 --> 00:04:36.960
And if they're not woke
and fully understand

00:04:36.960 --> 00:04:39.440
what's in front of them around special ed,

00:04:39.440 --> 00:04:43.030
then we can run into a lot
of problems as a district.

00:04:43.030 --> 00:04:46.900
So that training piece that
Chief Scott was talking about

00:04:46.900 --> 00:04:49.960
is absolutely, it's
vital in the same thing

00:04:49.960 --> 00:04:51.460
in our schools as well.

00:04:51.460 --> 00:04:55.040
And I'm saddled with that responsibility.

00:04:55.040 --> 00:04:57.800
We're also going to talk
about best practices

00:04:57.800 --> 00:05:02.680
in collaboration together,
meaning us me and you

00:05:03.550 --> 00:05:08.010
and the police of course as
well and all city agencies.

00:05:08.010 --> 00:05:10.280
All right, so this is me.

00:05:10.280 --> 00:05:15.280
I wanted you to understand
why I'm here and what I do.

00:05:17.360 --> 00:05:20.910
The photo on the left is me as a teacher

00:05:20.910 --> 00:05:22.420
at James Lick Middle School.

00:05:22.420 --> 00:05:27.303
It was probably 1997 maybe.

00:05:29.700 --> 00:05:31.210
That was about my third job.

00:05:31.210 --> 00:05:35.570
I started out as a first grade
teacher here in the city.

00:05:35.570 --> 00:05:37.370
I couldn't get a job
in the school district.

00:05:37.370 --> 00:05:39.650
They weren't hiring at that
time, so I went private.

00:05:39.650 --> 00:05:41.550
I worked at Discovery Center School.

00:05:41.550 --> 00:05:45.873
It was the old Safeway
on Ocean and Alemany.

00:05:47.488 --> 00:05:49.860
It was a very kind of
working class private school.

00:05:49.860 --> 00:05:52.970
A lot of families weren't
doing public schools

00:05:52.970 --> 00:05:55.410
back in the day, it was
a very diverse school.

00:05:55.410 --> 00:05:57.380
It was the cheapest one in the district.

00:05:57.380 --> 00:06:01.040
So I actually was exposed
to a lot of diversity

00:06:01.040 --> 00:06:03.920
and working class families,
and it was a good place

00:06:03.920 --> 00:06:04.830
for me to cut my teeth.

00:06:04.830 --> 00:06:07.580
I taught first grade and I really learned

00:06:07.580 --> 00:06:09.160
how to teach kids to read.

00:06:09.160 --> 00:06:12.040
I was using a research-based
reading curriculum

00:06:12.040 --> 00:06:15.070
and that was a wonderful
foundation for me.

00:06:15.070 --> 00:06:16.700
I needed to clear my credential.

00:06:16.700 --> 00:06:19.700
I cried, I had a baby, I
had to go back to college.

00:06:19.700 --> 00:06:20.950
I couldn't believe it.

00:06:20.950 --> 00:06:22.583
I thought, I can't do this.

00:06:24.125 --> 00:06:27.130
And my principal at the
time handed me a paper

00:06:27.130 --> 00:06:30.550
that spelled out a program at SF State

00:06:30.550 --> 00:06:32.140
and said, "Go do this."

00:06:32.140 --> 00:06:33.740
I said, "What is this?"

00:06:33.740 --> 00:06:36.210
She said it's a program
for master's degree

00:06:36.210 --> 00:06:37.810
in an administrator's credential.

00:06:37.810 --> 00:06:39.560
I said, "I'm not doing that."

00:06:39.560 --> 00:06:40.557
She said, "Do it!

00:06:40.557 --> 00:06:42.680
"You're gonna lose your
credential if you don't."

00:06:42.680 --> 00:06:45.090
So I said, "All right, how much is it?"

00:06:45.090 --> 00:06:46.460
So I asked my mom.

00:06:46.460 --> 00:06:48.800
My parents didn't pay
for much of my education.

00:06:48.800 --> 00:06:52.250
I went to a college in
Rhode Island where I'm from

00:06:52.250 --> 00:06:54.230
and commuted, I didn't live on campus.

00:06:54.230 --> 00:06:57.688
I went on the cheap, that's how we were.

00:06:57.688 --> 00:07:00.350
So I was their cheapest
kid, and when it came

00:07:00.350 --> 00:07:02.370
to getting a master's they
were sort of into that,

00:07:02.370 --> 00:07:04.780
so they helped me out a little bit

00:07:04.780 --> 00:07:07.320
and got me through that master's program.

00:07:07.320 --> 00:07:10.900
So at this job at James
Lick when that principal

00:07:10.900 --> 00:07:14.400
encouraged me to go higher,
I was teaching seventh

00:07:14.400 --> 00:07:16.150
and eighth grade, I was
a resource specialist.

00:07:16.150 --> 00:07:17.760
I did have a special ed credential.

00:07:17.760 --> 00:07:20.570
I always wanted to be a
special education teacher.

00:07:20.570 --> 00:07:23.030
I was drawn to kids who
learned differently.

00:07:23.030 --> 00:07:25.020
I was fascinated by them.

00:07:25.020 --> 00:07:27.440
I found them mysterious and exciting,

00:07:27.440 --> 00:07:28.970
and I wanted to get in their world.

00:07:28.970 --> 00:07:32.040
And more than anything
I wanted to help them.

00:07:32.040 --> 00:07:33.573
I was that kid.

00:07:34.698 --> 00:07:36.260
So that was a wonderful job.

00:07:36.260 --> 00:07:38.730
You can see I was thrilled and happy.

00:07:38.730 --> 00:07:42.210
Most of my career I've
been thrilled and happy.

00:07:42.210 --> 00:07:44.960
So after I got my master's
I also had another baby

00:07:44.960 --> 00:07:47.750
in that time, so I have two girls.

00:07:47.750 --> 00:07:52.460
So in 1999 I got my master's
I had my second baby.

00:07:52.460 --> 00:07:57.310
(coughs) Soon after that
they made me be a principal

00:07:57.310 --> 00:08:00.010
because we needed principals at the time.

00:08:00.010 --> 00:08:02.460
My husband said, "You can
do it, I encourage you!"

00:08:02.460 --> 00:08:03.293
I said, "I can't do it.

00:08:03.293 --> 00:08:05.020
"I don't know the first thing
about being a principal."

00:08:05.020 --> 00:08:06.750
He said, "You can do it, do it."

00:08:06.750 --> 00:08:08.680
So he said, "I'll support
you the whole way."

00:08:08.680 --> 00:08:12.150
So I took a job at
Grattan Elementary School

00:08:12.150 --> 00:08:13.900
in the year 2000.

00:08:13.900 --> 00:08:18.150
I had an 11-month-old baby
and a six-year-old daughter

00:08:18.150 --> 00:08:21.010
at Harvey Milk Civil
Rights Academy at the time.

00:08:21.010 --> 00:08:22.270
And I had a supportive husband.

00:08:22.270 --> 00:08:25.120
And there's me on the first
day of school as a principal.

00:08:26.630 --> 00:08:28.790
I stayed at Grattan, Grattan at that time

00:08:28.790 --> 00:08:30.190
had five empty classrooms.

00:08:30.190 --> 00:08:32.420
People didn't want to go to that school

00:08:32.420 --> 00:08:36.950
and I love a challenge, I love
a fight, I always want to win

00:08:36.950 --> 00:08:39.120
and I said, I'm gonna fix this.

00:08:39.120 --> 00:08:43.450
And over the course of a decade,
I was there for 11 years,

00:08:43.450 --> 00:08:46.580
that school went cray
cray, it went off the map.

00:08:46.580 --> 00:08:48.360
People just came in droves.

00:08:48.360 --> 00:08:50.260
They just wanted to be at that school.

00:08:50.260 --> 00:08:52.083
And basically what we did,

00:08:53.760 --> 00:08:56.060
we were just so accepting of everybody.

00:08:56.060 --> 00:08:58.237
They asked me at that time
at that school, they said,

00:08:58.237 --> 00:09:02.797
"Will you have a class for
kids with special needs?

00:09:02.797 --> 00:09:04.807
"Autism is on the rise, we need a school

00:09:04.807 --> 00:09:07.340
"to host autism classes."

00:09:07.340 --> 00:09:09.200
And remember, I had five empty classrooms.

00:09:09.200 --> 00:09:11.380
I was the special ed principal.

00:09:11.380 --> 00:09:13.860
I said, "Of course I'll
take autism at my school."

00:09:13.860 --> 00:09:18.860
And so that was the beginning
of a beautiful journey.

00:09:19.560 --> 00:09:23.570
I have so many stories and
some of them involve police.

00:09:23.570 --> 00:09:25.390
When our,
(audience laughing)

00:09:25.390 --> 00:09:28.460
so it's making me think
about all the crossovers

00:09:28.460 --> 00:09:31.300
that we have together, you
know, I had one kid with autism

00:09:31.300 --> 00:09:35.250
who was attracted to Sutro Tower.

00:09:35.250 --> 00:09:37.860
If you know where Grattan
is, it's down in Cole Valley

00:09:37.860 --> 00:09:40.507
and Sutro is right up
the hill on Tank Hill.

00:09:40.507 --> 00:09:44.360
And this kid was determined
to go to Tank Hill.

00:09:44.360 --> 00:09:47.790
And so we had to put
the school on lockdown.

00:09:47.790 --> 00:09:51.800
And well, one day he escaped.

00:09:51.800 --> 00:09:54.040
And we knew he was missing,

00:09:54.040 --> 00:09:56.000
so I always had the five-minute rule

00:09:56.000 --> 00:09:57.599
'cause sometimes they're in therapy,

00:09:57.599 --> 00:10:02.130
sometimes, 99% of the time
they're in the building,

00:10:02.130 --> 00:10:04.940
just so you know, but every
once in a while they're not.

00:10:04.940 --> 00:10:06.420
And so I have a five-minute rule,

00:10:06.420 --> 00:10:07.840
and if we can't find him in five minutes

00:10:07.840 --> 00:10:10.290
we have to call the cops, and so we did.

00:10:10.290 --> 00:10:12.740
We ran around, well, we had
to call the cops that day

00:10:12.740 --> 00:10:17.080
and they found him up on Rivoli,
just two blocks up alone.

00:10:17.080 --> 00:10:20.310
A kid with autism tiptoeing and flapping

00:10:20.310 --> 00:10:22.600
and looking for Sutro Tower.

00:10:22.600 --> 00:10:27.280
So I just want to say thank
you to your police officers.

00:10:27.280 --> 00:10:30.850
I've had three kids escape
in my 18 years as a principal

00:10:30.850 --> 00:10:35.150
and two involved the
police, one I got myself.

00:10:35.150 --> 00:10:37.750
But it's real, that's real.

00:10:37.750 --> 00:10:40.730
And I'm not proud that kids
escaped, but they do escape.

00:10:40.730 --> 00:10:43.941
If any of you have any experience
with kids on the spectrum,

00:10:43.941 --> 00:10:48.930
(coughs) that notion of
finding that happy place

00:10:48.930 --> 00:10:50.490
or that balance is very real.

00:10:50.490 --> 00:10:53.360
And they'll do whatever
they can to get there.

00:10:53.360 --> 00:10:56.460
So anyway, after my 11 years
there I sent to special ed

00:10:56.460 --> 00:10:58.010
for a year because I got recruited

00:10:58.010 --> 00:10:59.670
because I was the special ed principal.

00:10:59.670 --> 00:11:01.350
And they said, Jean, we
want you to come over here

00:11:01.350 --> 00:11:03.920
and do this supervisor job.

00:11:03.920 --> 00:11:06.630
I did it for one year, there
were 21 schools under my

00:11:07.800 --> 00:11:11.030
supervisorial genius I guess,
whatever you want to call it.

00:11:11.030 --> 00:11:14.080
It was nuts, one of the
schools in that time

00:11:14.080 --> 00:11:18.070
was Glen Park School, who had
had a principal for 29 years,

00:11:18.070 --> 00:11:19.920
and they had two special day classes

00:11:19.920 --> 00:11:23.100
and when I went to that school
and I saw the conditions

00:11:23.100 --> 00:11:26.750
at Glen Park School
compared to the conditions

00:11:26.750 --> 00:11:31.750
at Grattan school I just
felt such a compelling draw

00:11:32.400 --> 00:11:36.320
to go back to a school and
help that community build

00:11:36.320 --> 00:11:41.320
and grow a program that is
noteworthy in a positive way.

00:11:41.510 --> 00:11:42.960
And I wanted to be with the kids

00:11:42.960 --> 00:11:46.520
in building a community,
so I went back to a school

00:11:46.520 --> 00:11:49.420
and I stayed at Glen Park for six years

00:11:49.420 --> 00:11:54.420
until Dr. Matthews started
as our superintendent.

00:11:54.928 --> 00:11:58.770
(coughs) And he asked me
to apply to be the chief

00:11:59.670 --> 00:12:04.670
of special ed because he
felt I was right for it

00:12:04.810 --> 00:12:06.990
for the reasons that I, whatever,

00:12:06.990 --> 00:12:07.870
I'm not gonna get into that.

00:12:07.870 --> 00:12:11.920
He worked on me and I said
no, who would do that job?

00:12:11.920 --> 00:12:14.530
That's an awful job, that's
the worst job in the district.

00:12:14.530 --> 00:12:16.980
Being the chief of special ed is seriously

00:12:16.980 --> 00:12:20.960
an incredibly difficult place to be

00:12:20.960 --> 00:12:24.303
because we're not at
our best in our schools.

00:12:26.040 --> 00:12:28.460
We're not always doing great.

00:12:28.460 --> 00:12:31.360
We do do great things,
but we have problems.

00:12:31.360 --> 00:12:34.430
We have a lot of pockets of
problems in our district as well

00:12:35.440 --> 00:12:37.180
and it's a huge endeavor.

00:12:37.180 --> 00:12:38.730
Remember, I told you I wanted to win

00:12:38.730 --> 00:12:41.210
and I wanted to make things great.

00:12:41.210 --> 00:12:43.830
Well, I felt this might
be a little bigger than me

00:12:43.830 --> 00:12:45.880
and I might not be up to it.

00:12:45.880 --> 00:12:47.380
Anyway, they worked on me for six months

00:12:47.380 --> 00:12:49.860
and I finally said yes, so here I am,

00:12:49.860 --> 00:12:53.370
chief of special education
and I'm determined

00:12:53.370 --> 00:12:55.640
to better the conditions in our schools

00:12:55.640 --> 00:12:57.510
and in our city for
kids with special needs.

00:12:57.510 --> 00:13:00.410
So I'm in for the long haul
as long as the Board of Ed

00:13:00.410 --> 00:13:01.603
doesn't fire me.

00:13:03.000 --> 00:13:07.040
So, as I said, my career
has been in San Francisco.

00:13:07.040 --> 00:13:09.890
We are guided by these core values

00:13:09.890 --> 00:13:13.033
and they absolutely speak to me.

00:13:14.300 --> 00:13:16.030
Just seeing if there's anything else here.

00:13:16.030 --> 00:13:20.030
No, we're gonna move on 'cause
we're making up some time.

00:13:20.030 --> 00:13:22.460
Our mission is that
every day we provide each

00:13:22.460 --> 00:13:24.760
and every student the quality instruction

00:13:24.760 --> 00:13:26.460
and equitable support required

00:13:26.460 --> 00:13:28.860
to thrive in the 21st century.

00:13:28.860 --> 00:13:31.470
If any of you write me
an email and I respond,

00:13:31.470 --> 00:13:34.903
my little tagline at the
bottom is whatever it takes.

00:13:36.610 --> 00:13:38.010
Wholly committed to whatever it takes

00:13:38.010 --> 00:13:39.150
in the life of a child.

00:13:39.150 --> 00:13:43.270
So this sort of captures
that a little bit as well,

00:13:43.270 --> 00:13:45.023
this notion of equitable support.

00:13:49.840 --> 00:13:52.370
We are very committed to
equity in our district

00:13:52.370 --> 00:13:53.370
because we have problems,

00:13:53.370 --> 00:13:55.820
we have huge disproportionality problems,

00:13:55.820 --> 00:13:58.850
and so this has bubbled up always.

00:13:58.850 --> 00:14:02.820
And recently I was at a
superintendent meeting

00:14:02.820 --> 00:14:05.540
and I noticed that in
this equity definition

00:14:05.540 --> 00:14:07.270
that they were putting up, they put it up

00:14:07.270 --> 00:14:09.850
in front of us every time there was a word

00:14:09.850 --> 00:14:12.880
that was missing, and I was very upset.

00:14:12.880 --> 00:14:14.810
And so I'm gonna read this to you

00:14:14.810 --> 00:14:16.770
and then I want you to just think

00:14:16.770 --> 00:14:19.870
what word may have been
missing that really upset me.

00:14:19.870 --> 00:14:23.360
The work of eliminating
oppression, ending biases,

00:14:23.360 --> 00:14:27.300
and ensuring equally high
outcomes for all participants

00:14:27.300 --> 00:14:31.640
through the creation of
multicultural, multiable,

00:14:31.640 --> 00:14:35.830
multilingual, multiethnic,
multiracial practices

00:14:35.830 --> 00:14:39.410
and conditions; removing the
predictability of success

00:14:39.410 --> 00:14:41.350
or failure that currently correlates

00:14:41.350 --> 00:14:44.523
with any social or cultural factor.

00:14:46.660 --> 00:14:48.210
Do you think you know the word?

00:14:49.260 --> 00:14:50.507
It was multiable.

00:14:51.530 --> 00:14:53.290
First of all, I don't even know

00:14:53.290 --> 00:14:56.170
if I'd seen that word in print
prior to this definition,

00:14:56.170 --> 00:14:58.110
but when I did see it it spoke to me.

00:14:58.110 --> 00:15:00.930
I thought, wow, they
really, they called it out.

00:15:00.930 --> 00:15:04.740
Ability awareness is so incredibly huge,

00:15:04.740 --> 00:15:06.460
and what you were talking
about, Chief Scott,

00:15:06.460 --> 00:15:10.960
is ability awareness on your police force.

00:15:10.960 --> 00:15:15.233
Well, my school force,
whatever you want to call it,

00:15:17.080 --> 00:15:19.500
that's the vital work that I have to do

00:15:19.500 --> 00:15:22.620
is because there are
teachers of different levels

00:15:22.620 --> 00:15:25.200
of understanding around ability awareness.

00:15:25.200 --> 00:15:28.720
So that's part of my vision

00:15:28.720 --> 00:15:30.370
in the work that I'm gonna continue to do

00:15:30.370 --> 00:15:32.623
over the course of the next several years.

00:15:34.930 --> 00:15:38.090
Vision 2025 is re-imagining
public education

00:15:38.090 --> 00:15:39.960
in San Francisco for a new generation.

00:15:39.960 --> 00:15:41.753
This is a document, it's
more than a document,

00:15:41.753 --> 00:15:43.630
I mean, it's captured in a document,

00:15:43.630 --> 00:15:45.920
but this was a process that took place

00:15:45.920 --> 00:15:48.140
under the direction of Richard Carranza,

00:15:48.140 --> 00:15:51.710
who was our superintendent
several years ago.

00:15:51.710 --> 00:15:55.850
I loved Richard, I love most
people, I'm one of those people

00:15:55.850 --> 00:15:58.620
I get fired up and inspired.

00:15:58.620 --> 00:16:02.160
I loved the work in Vision
2025, and there's a lot in it.

00:16:02.160 --> 00:16:04.370
And I was going to sort of bust out

00:16:04.370 --> 00:16:06.780
some of what's great in it today,

00:16:06.780 --> 00:16:09.560
but I need to cut back
a little bit on time,

00:16:09.560 --> 00:16:10.840
so I'm not gonna go too into it.

00:16:10.840 --> 00:16:13.520
I think that you're gonna have
these slides available to you

00:16:13.520 --> 00:16:16.910
so I encourage you to
look into Vision 2025,

00:16:16.910 --> 00:16:19.970
but basically what it
is, is truly re-imagining

00:16:19.970 --> 00:16:23.470
what schools look like and
how we educate our kids.

00:16:23.470 --> 00:16:26.610
I'll just pop this out for an example.

00:16:26.610 --> 00:16:31.420
You're doctors and
clinicians, you know so much.

00:16:31.420 --> 00:16:33.360
When you think about a middle school kid

00:16:33.360 --> 00:16:36.190
and sort of what's happening
in their body around

00:16:36.190 --> 00:16:39.040
not only hormones, but
their sleep patterns,

00:16:39.040 --> 00:16:41.470
I have to question, beg the question

00:16:41.470 --> 00:16:44.690
why do we make middle
school kids go to school

00:16:44.690 --> 00:16:47.210
at 7:00 and 8:00 o'clock in the morning

00:16:47.210 --> 00:16:50.220
when their bodies are so
completely upside down

00:16:50.220 --> 00:16:52.520
and they don't really
settle down and go to sleep

00:16:52.520 --> 00:16:54.540
until midnight or 1:00 in the morning.

00:16:54.540 --> 00:16:57.080
Like, that's their rhythm in their bodies,

00:16:57.080 --> 00:17:01.940
so I would hope that as
we go towards Vision 2025

00:17:02.910 --> 00:17:07.260
that we're thinking about not
only imagining environmental

00:17:07.260 --> 00:17:12.110
space, our time limits
on kids, how we get kids

00:17:12.110 --> 00:17:16.050
to show what they know, why
we're still bubbling in bubbles

00:17:16.050 --> 00:17:21.050
on norm-referenced
tests is just beyond me.

00:17:21.300 --> 00:17:23.820
Kids have multiple
intelligences and it's important

00:17:23.820 --> 00:17:27.460
that we capture their
genius and their brilliance

00:17:27.460 --> 00:17:30.870
in a way that they're comfortable
and what's right for them

00:17:30.870 --> 00:17:33.400
in sharing their brilliance and genius.

00:17:33.400 --> 00:17:35.443
So I'm gonna move on from that.

00:17:37.100 --> 00:17:41.320
Part of the Vision 2025
is the Graduate Profile.

00:17:41.320 --> 00:17:43.190
So I'm just gonna leave
this up here for a minute

00:17:43.190 --> 00:17:45.203
and let you take a quick look.

00:17:46.670 --> 00:17:50.830
This is what we're hoping
that our graduates will have

00:17:51.800 --> 00:17:53.443
at the end of their tenure.

00:17:57.190 --> 00:17:58.963
I love the creativity piece.

00:18:00.210 --> 00:18:02.710
If that was valued when I was growing up

00:18:04.210 --> 00:18:08.530
I would have been a genius.
(audience laughing)

00:18:08.530 --> 00:18:13.270
OK, the next slide, these are
my friends just so you know.

00:18:13.270 --> 00:18:17.260
These are my kids, and I have
so many beautiful pictures

00:18:17.260 --> 00:18:21.560
that capture 18 years of
running a show in the district,

00:18:21.560 --> 00:18:26.040
but I had to be really
mindful of privacy laws.

00:18:26.040 --> 00:18:28.430
But this is Mr. Scott and his crew,

00:18:28.430 --> 00:18:31.280
and I thought I'd just throw
one little slide in there

00:18:31.280 --> 00:18:33.910
to give you a glimpse of the beauty

00:18:33.910 --> 00:18:36.400
that I get to spend my days with everyday.

00:18:36.400 --> 00:18:39.140
So you pretty much know what
developmental disabilities are

00:18:39.140 --> 00:18:44.120
I would hope, but I did
capture a quick definition

00:18:44.120 --> 00:18:48.633
from the Centers of Disease
Control and Prevention.

00:18:50.300 --> 00:18:51.483
And I'm gonna move on.

00:18:52.990 --> 00:18:55.000
And you know who is affected.

00:18:55.000 --> 00:18:58.840
Developmental disabilities
occur among all racial, ethnic,

00:18:58.840 --> 00:19:00.840
and socioeconomic groups.

00:19:00.840 --> 00:19:04.360
It's an equal opportunity condition.

00:19:04.360 --> 00:19:06.170
Recent estimates in the United States

00:19:06.170 --> 00:19:09.280
show that about one in six,
or about 15% of children

00:19:09.280 --> 00:19:11.840
aged three through 17 years have one

00:19:11.840 --> 00:19:14.048
or more developmental disabilities.

00:19:14.048 --> 00:19:16.203
And these are some of them listed here.

00:19:22.210 --> 00:19:26.170
So, in my world it all starts
with the federal mandate

00:19:26.170 --> 00:19:29.490
of IDEA, the Individuals
with Disabilities Act.

00:19:29.490 --> 00:19:34.313
It's the law, I love saying it's the law.

00:19:35.330 --> 00:19:39.170
My teachers when they would
try to sneak out of something

00:19:39.170 --> 00:19:41.970
or come up with a new
idea that wasn't quite

00:19:41.970 --> 00:19:45.530
within the parameters of the
law I would always just say,

00:19:45.530 --> 00:19:47.780
it's the law like it's non-negotiable.

00:19:47.780 --> 00:19:51.320
And then not only just
saying it's the law,

00:19:51.320 --> 00:19:54.800
but we say it's what is right for kids.

00:19:54.800 --> 00:19:56.310
We always followed it up with,

00:19:56.310 --> 00:19:57.870
this is what is right for kids.

00:19:57.870 --> 00:19:59.423
It's a law for a reason.

00:20:02.150 --> 00:20:06.320
So the primary purposes of
IDEA are to provide a free

00:20:06.320 --> 00:20:10.970
appropriate public education
to children with disabilities.

00:20:10.970 --> 00:20:12.680
We call it FAPE.

00:20:12.680 --> 00:20:16.870
You know we're the acronym
capital of the world, OK.

00:20:16.870 --> 00:20:21.760
IDEA requires schools to
find and evaluate students

00:20:21.760 --> 00:20:25.940
suspected of having disabilities
at no cost to the parents.

00:20:25.940 --> 00:20:28.180
Once kids are identified
as having a disability

00:20:28.180 --> 00:20:30.748
schools much provide them
with special education

00:20:30.748 --> 00:20:34.290
and related services like
speech therapy and counseling

00:20:34.290 --> 00:20:36.240
to meet their unique needs.

00:20:36.240 --> 00:20:41.240
The goal is to help students
make progress in school.

00:20:42.830 --> 00:20:45.340
This progress thing is very real,

00:20:45.340 --> 00:20:48.880
and I could do another whole
20 slides just on progress,

00:20:48.880 --> 00:20:51.720
progress monitoring, how
often we get in trouble

00:20:51.720 --> 00:20:53.610
for not progress monitoring.

00:20:53.610 --> 00:20:58.450
That is a big, big litigation
issue in our district.

00:20:58.450 --> 00:21:02.820
And I imagine it is in many
districts, but this is key.

00:21:02.820 --> 00:21:05.050
We have to write
appropriate goals for kids

00:21:05.050 --> 00:21:07.360
and then we have to watch them.

00:21:07.360 --> 00:21:10.740
And we have to collect data
and map, how are they doing

00:21:10.740 --> 00:21:13.570
just like you do in your work.

00:21:13.570 --> 00:21:16.600
I imagine you're looking to
see how kids are developing.

00:21:16.600 --> 00:21:20.420
And you have your little
charts and percentiles.

00:21:20.420 --> 00:21:22.470
I know you do, I have two kids, remember.

00:21:26.290 --> 00:21:28.370
It is also to give parents a voice

00:21:28.370 --> 00:21:30.870
in their child's education.

00:21:30.870 --> 00:21:35.020
So I have a little anecdote on this one.

00:21:35.020 --> 00:21:38.470
Remember that first slide
when I was in my 20s

00:21:38.470 --> 00:21:40.380
at James Lick Middle School

00:21:40.380 --> 00:21:43.060
is when I really first
started writing IEPs.

00:21:43.060 --> 00:21:45.370
Prior to that I had just
been a college student

00:21:45.370 --> 00:21:48.550
and did practice IEPs,
and then I taught gen-ed

00:21:48.550 --> 00:21:50.640
for six years in the first grade.

00:21:50.640 --> 00:21:52.000
So when I went to the middle school

00:21:52.000 --> 00:21:53.850
I had to start writing IEPs.

00:21:53.850 --> 00:21:57.730
And oh, I thought I was great at IEPs.

00:21:57.730 --> 00:22:01.300
You know, I'd sit there
and connect with the family

00:22:01.300 --> 00:22:05.410
and talk about the kid and after one IEP

00:22:05.410 --> 00:22:08.190
my partner at the school counselor Palel.

00:22:08.190 --> 00:22:10.540
I'll never forget him, he's a good guy.

00:22:10.540 --> 00:22:13.230
He was so kind, I'm so blessed

00:22:13.230 --> 00:22:15.840
that I've had kind people around me.

00:22:15.840 --> 00:22:17.620
I've had maybe not so kind people,

00:22:17.620 --> 00:22:19.060
but the kind people are the ones

00:22:19.060 --> 00:22:21.410
that shaped my behavior as an educator.

00:22:21.410 --> 00:22:23.810
And he put his hand on mine and he said,

00:22:23.810 --> 00:22:25.520
I said, "How did I do, how was that?"

00:22:25.520 --> 00:22:27.240
He's like, "That was great."

00:22:27.240 --> 00:22:30.917
He said, "But, you really
never let the parents speak.

00:22:30.917 --> 00:22:33.220
"You did almost all of the talking."

00:22:33.220 --> 00:22:37.000
And I remember it was like a gut punch

00:22:37.000 --> 00:22:38.530
'cause I thought I did great, you know,

00:22:38.530 --> 00:22:40.160
here I am like, woo-hoo!

00:22:40.160 --> 00:22:43.920
He's like, you never
really let the parent share

00:22:43.920 --> 00:22:46.240
what they needed to
share about their parent.

00:22:46.240 --> 00:22:48.500
And luckily, I can honestly say this,

00:22:48.500 --> 00:22:51.910
luckily that happened very
early in my special ed career

00:22:51.910 --> 00:22:55.496
so I was mindful of that
forever on afterwards

00:22:55.496 --> 00:22:59.300
that that parent's voice and input,

00:22:59.300 --> 00:23:02.820
they are the expert of
their child hands down.

00:23:02.820 --> 00:23:04.551
They know their kid better than anybody.

00:23:04.551 --> 00:23:06.540
I was an expert of 28 kids.

00:23:06.540 --> 00:23:10.440
I had a caseload of 28
kids, so I had my case load.

00:23:10.440 --> 00:23:13.470
I always say, the
principal's an expert of 350

00:23:13.470 --> 00:23:15.770
or 400, whatever their world is,

00:23:15.770 --> 00:23:19.690
but that parent has the most information

00:23:19.690 --> 00:23:23.010
from a really unique standpoint.

00:23:23.010 --> 00:23:25.473
And I hope that you always were valued

00:23:25.473 --> 00:23:29.060
and had good input in
your IEPs for your son.

00:23:29.060 --> 00:23:31.800
And that is something that I will focus on

00:23:31.800 --> 00:23:35.510
very strongly and carefully
in my new role as chief

00:23:35.510 --> 00:23:39.280
is to get schools and my
people who support the schools,

00:23:39.280 --> 00:23:42.170
I have a whole staff that
support the 121 schools

00:23:43.160 --> 00:23:45.990
to really value, and
not act like a big shot

00:23:45.990 --> 00:23:49.730
like we're know-it-alls
'cause we're not know-it-alls.

00:23:49.730 --> 00:23:51.663
So that's another part of IDEA.

00:23:53.739 --> 00:23:55.570
The third part I wanted to mention

00:23:55.570 --> 00:24:00.570
is the IDEA covers children
from birth through 21 or 22

00:24:00.890 --> 00:24:03.130
depending on where their birthday falls

00:24:03.130 --> 00:24:04.760
and it provides early intervention

00:24:04.760 --> 00:24:09.570
which we all know is key through age three

00:24:09.570 --> 00:24:11.560
into the public schools.

00:24:11.560 --> 00:24:15.573
And we also have to support
kids in charter schools.

00:24:17.630 --> 00:24:21.782
We even support some kids in
the private school sector.

00:24:21.782 --> 00:24:25.050
That's another 20-slide presentation

00:24:25.050 --> 00:24:29.170
about how vast our commitments
are as a public school

00:24:30.140 --> 00:24:31.890
Department of Special Education.

00:24:31.890 --> 00:24:36.490
It's not just the 121 schools
in the comprehensive system,

00:24:36.490 --> 00:24:39.630
but it's also throughout this entire city.

00:24:39.630 --> 00:24:42.123
We are the city and
County of San Francisco,

00:24:43.204 --> 00:24:44.920
so we're our own SELPA,

00:24:44.920 --> 00:24:48.320
which stands for the Special
Education Local Plan Area.

00:24:48.320 --> 00:24:49.700
Oftentimes it's county-wise

00:24:49.700 --> 00:24:51.880
and there's lots of districts in a SELPA

00:24:51.880 --> 00:24:53.150
and then they support each other

00:24:53.150 --> 00:24:54.720
and they get funding that way.

00:24:54.720 --> 00:24:56.570
So I'm also the SELPA director.

00:24:56.570 --> 00:24:58.290
Not only am I the, see, I told you

00:24:58.290 --> 00:24:59.967
this was the hardest job in the district.

00:24:59.967 --> 00:25:02.060
I'm the chief and the SELPA director,

00:25:02.060 --> 00:25:04.053
so it's the entire city.

00:25:05.820 --> 00:25:07.023
So it's nuts.

00:25:08.700 --> 00:25:11.360
But I'm here basically to tell you today

00:25:11.360 --> 00:25:12.900
that teamwork makes the dream work.

00:25:12.900 --> 00:25:16.580
Now, this sounds dorky and
I've been known to say it

00:25:16.580 --> 00:25:20.310
on a daily basis, and we
used to laugh at each other

00:25:20.310 --> 00:25:23.910
at the school site, and
when I went up to the beach,

00:25:23.910 --> 00:25:26.680
the Santiago Special Ed Department

00:25:26.680 --> 00:25:28.490
I started saying it there.

00:25:28.490 --> 00:25:31.777
I actually got pushback from
one of my people who said,

00:25:31.777 --> 00:25:33.030
"You know, why do you say that?"

00:25:33.030 --> 00:25:34.920
That's just, you know, she didn't like it.

00:25:34.920 --> 00:25:37.600
And she's like, I have
my team, this is my team.

00:25:37.600 --> 00:25:39.740
So she's got a division of special ed.

00:25:39.740 --> 00:25:42.450
And she talks to her team, and so we had

00:25:42.450 --> 00:25:44.640
to kind of have a little
bit of a smackdown

00:25:44.640 --> 00:25:49.640
on why we're gonna say this,
and you have to buy into this.

00:25:50.400 --> 00:25:51.633
We're in this together.

00:25:52.800 --> 00:25:54.400
But I'm also here to tell you today

00:25:54.400 --> 00:25:57.340
that I'm in this with you as well.

00:25:57.340 --> 00:26:00.500
And basically I think that's
why I was invited here today.

00:26:00.500 --> 00:26:03.030
I want to give you a glimpse into my world

00:26:03.030 --> 00:26:07.152
and I want to let you know
where we can cross over

00:26:07.152 --> 00:26:10.760
and do this work together
and hopefully by the end,

00:26:10.760 --> 00:26:14.000
and I'm watching this clock,
and we can do some Q and A,

00:26:14.000 --> 00:26:18.070
but some of my greatest,
and I'm most proud of work

00:26:18.070 --> 00:26:20.880
is the work that I've done when I was able

00:26:20.880 --> 00:26:25.880
to cross over with the medical
professionals in this city.

00:26:26.060 --> 00:26:30.850
That's when we did our greatest
work, so, here you are.

00:26:30.850 --> 00:26:33.260
Early intervention is vital.

00:26:33.260 --> 00:26:34.720
The parents are on the front line,

00:26:34.720 --> 00:26:36.460
so they get a little
inkling when something

00:26:36.460 --> 00:26:38.090
might not be OK with their kid.

00:26:38.090 --> 00:26:39.870
Where if any of you are parents

00:26:39.870 --> 00:26:42.660
you know what your gut is
telling you on any given day.

00:26:42.660 --> 00:26:45.560
I have a kid, I had a kid on an IEP.

00:26:45.560 --> 00:26:48.160
I cried like a baby on the day

00:26:48.160 --> 00:26:50.347
that her teacher came to me and he said,

00:26:50.347 --> 00:26:52.340
"I think we should do an assessment,"

00:26:52.340 --> 00:26:55.733
'cause I knew in my
heart that my kid wasn't,

00:26:56.830 --> 00:27:00.240
I don't want to say normal,
she was broken, she was not OK.

00:27:00.240 --> 00:27:03.530
My daughter was not OK, and
she was really struggling.

00:27:03.530 --> 00:27:07.110
And we're Kaiser, we were a Kaiser family,

00:27:07.110 --> 00:27:09.400
and God bless her pediatrician.

00:27:09.400 --> 00:27:11.670
She was my greatest, greatest partner

00:27:11.670 --> 00:27:13.090
in the work with my daughter.

00:27:13.090 --> 00:27:15.840
My daughter's great,
she's a self-advocate.

00:27:15.840 --> 00:27:19.400
She's 19, she's a sophomore
at Portland State.

00:27:19.400 --> 00:27:24.100
She wants to cure cancer,
she's a math nerd scientist.

00:27:24.100 --> 00:27:26.063
She wants to wear a lab coat.

00:27:27.870 --> 00:27:29.540
She doesn't really want
to deal with people.

00:27:29.540 --> 00:27:33.790
She wants to work with test
tubes and Petri dishes I think,

00:27:33.790 --> 00:27:36.670
but she wasn't OK as a little girl.

00:27:36.670 --> 00:27:39.123
She had the wigglies, we
called it, the wiggles.

00:27:40.030 --> 00:27:44.253
She had some repetitive behaviors,
some OCD stuff going on.

00:27:45.780 --> 00:27:50.780
High anxiety, wouldn't
transition, just nightmarish.

00:27:51.300 --> 00:27:54.630
Working mom, you know, the
kid that wouldn't leave school

00:27:54.630 --> 00:27:56.750
at the end of the, I
mean, that was just awful.

00:27:56.750 --> 00:28:01.260
It was horrible, anyway,
I cried because I knew,

00:28:01.260 --> 00:28:04.020
I knew, I knew, so we got her assessed

00:28:04.020 --> 00:28:06.950
and plugged her into a resource program

00:28:06.950 --> 00:28:09.770
where she had an advocate
and she got a lot of help

00:28:09.770 --> 00:28:12.530
with her executive functioning.

00:28:12.530 --> 00:28:16.630
And I didn't have to do it.

00:28:16.630 --> 00:28:18.970
My parenting stopped
basically at that point

00:28:18.970 --> 00:28:20.560
and she took off on her own

00:28:20.560 --> 00:28:22.970
once she knew what her conditions were.

00:28:22.970 --> 00:28:25.440
I remember the day, too, she
said, "I need a therapist."

00:28:25.440 --> 00:28:26.640
I said, "Go to the Wellness Center."

00:28:26.640 --> 00:28:28.120
She went to Mission High.

00:28:28.120 --> 00:28:30.150
I said, "They have a
great Wellness Center."

00:28:30.150 --> 00:28:32.617
She said, "I don't need a counselor Mom,

00:28:32.617 --> 00:28:35.950
"I need a therapist."
(audience laughing)

00:28:35.950 --> 00:28:37.530
I was like, oh.

00:28:37.530 --> 00:28:39.650
I said, "Well, go call one."

00:28:39.650 --> 00:28:42.880
You know, I was like,
I work all day, sister.

00:28:42.880 --> 00:28:47.010
Anyway, she's doing
great, but it wasn't easy.

00:28:47.010 --> 00:28:50.913
So I put this slide up just because,

00:28:52.600 --> 00:28:54.610
honestly because I'm here with you today

00:28:54.610 --> 00:28:58.300
but also my experience is absolutely

00:28:58.300 --> 00:29:02.733
a firm, strong partnership with
her pediatrician, big time.

00:29:05.545 --> 00:29:07.530
So I wanna tell you quickly a little bit

00:29:07.530 --> 00:29:10.660
about who we are in
special ed and what we do.

00:29:10.660 --> 00:29:14.253
So, I have data, just a little bit.

00:29:15.220 --> 00:29:16.770
This, can you read this?

00:29:16.770 --> 00:29:19.070
The numbers, is the font big enough?

00:29:19.070 --> 00:29:24.070
OK, try to, when I asked my
statistician guy to do this

00:29:24.670 --> 00:29:28.450
it was tiny, I said they're
never gonna be able to read this

00:29:28.450 --> 00:29:30.240
but basically this is a pie chart

00:29:30.240 --> 00:29:35.037
showing all of our 7,590 kids on IEPs

00:29:36.440 --> 00:29:38.093
and what their breakdown is.

00:29:40.100 --> 00:29:42.100
And I don't know why it
says category name, value

00:29:42.100 --> 00:29:43.840
up at the top, that's fascinating.

00:29:43.840 --> 00:29:45.720
Oh my God, they're all different.

00:29:45.720 --> 00:29:48.330
That's not what it says on mine.

00:29:48.330 --> 00:29:50.800
So let me just tell you.
(audience laughing)

00:29:50.800 --> 00:29:52.760
It didn't transfer correctly.

00:29:52.760 --> 00:29:57.660
So the big part of the pie is
specific learning disability.

00:29:57.660 --> 00:30:01.010
The second going down is
speech and language impairment

00:30:01.010 --> 00:30:06.010
is 18.2%, autism is 15.8%,
other health impaired is 14.6%.

00:30:09.230 --> 00:30:12.510
Intellectual disability
is the yellow, that's 5%.

00:30:13.680 --> 00:30:18.680
Emotional disturbance is
the gray, and that is 4.7%.

00:30:18.990 --> 00:30:23.323
Low incidence is 2.9% and
hard of hearing is 2.3.

00:30:25.950 --> 00:30:30.140
The emotional disturbance
one I always take issue with

00:30:30.140 --> 00:30:34.810
because our kids who have many ACEs,

00:30:34.810 --> 00:30:36.350
are you familiar with the term ACEs,

00:30:36.350 --> 00:30:38.680
adverse childhood experiences?

00:30:38.680 --> 00:30:41.420
Yes, OK, good, I figured you were.

00:30:43.990 --> 00:30:48.990
Our kids who have trauma
and ACEs often get captured

00:30:49.680 --> 00:30:52.110
and identified in that category.

00:30:52.110 --> 00:30:55.310
I struggle with that greatly
because there's a predominance

00:30:55.310 --> 00:30:57.540
of Black children in that category

00:30:58.400 --> 00:31:03.400
that come from poverty areas in the city

00:31:04.210 --> 00:31:09.210
and I have to question
whether or not our conditions

00:31:10.450 --> 00:31:12.880
on the general ed side in the Safe

00:31:12.880 --> 00:31:16.490
and Supportive Schools side,
the work of my dear friend

00:31:16.490 --> 00:31:20.620
and partner Kevin Truitt, if
we're not doing enough there.

00:31:20.620 --> 00:31:24.080
If we did a better job on the front end

00:31:24.080 --> 00:31:28.280
creating conditions to
address ACEs in our schools

00:31:28.280 --> 00:31:30.400
then I have a funny feeling that

00:31:30.400 --> 00:31:33.250
that data point would be less.

00:31:33.250 --> 00:31:36.480
So that's something
that I'm very mindful of

00:31:36.480 --> 00:31:39.170
and I'm going to be working on.

00:31:39.170 --> 00:31:42.080
Unfortunately Kevin tells
me he's retiring soon

00:31:42.080 --> 00:31:45.760
and I'm very sad about that
because we have a lot of work

00:31:45.760 --> 00:31:46.973
to do together still.

00:31:48.020 --> 00:31:50.130
All right, moving on to the next slide.

00:31:50.130 --> 00:31:54.037
Educational setting, so now
you know we have 7,590 kids

00:31:55.400 --> 00:31:59.290
on IEPs, and in the big gray space here

00:31:59.290 --> 00:32:03.420
is the RSP program, so
about 60% of our kids

00:32:03.420 --> 00:32:06.629
are in the RSP program
and in the yellow 17,

00:32:06.629 --> 00:32:09.540
almost 18% are speech and language only.

00:32:09.540 --> 00:32:13.580
So about 75% of our
kids are all general ed.

00:32:13.580 --> 00:32:15.940
We consider them general ed kids.

00:32:15.940 --> 00:32:17.750
The orange is special day class,

00:32:17.750 --> 00:32:21.773
and the blue are kids
in non-public schools.

00:32:23.080 --> 00:32:24.610
That's another conversation.

00:32:24.610 --> 00:32:28.430
There's a lot going on with
our kids in non-public schools.

00:32:28.430 --> 00:32:32.150
And it's actually, well,
that's 20 more slides.

00:32:32.150 --> 00:32:34.700
I'll come back next year
and we'll talk about that.

00:32:35.970 --> 00:32:38.210
Kids on the autism spectrum.

00:32:38.210 --> 00:32:41.190
So at the bottom of this
on the left hand side

00:32:41.190 --> 00:32:44.560
is the year 2000, which
is the year I started

00:32:44.560 --> 00:32:47.400
at Grattan Elementary School.

00:32:47.400 --> 00:32:51.870
And I believe in about 2004
is when we got our first class

00:32:51.870 --> 00:32:55.060
for kids with autism that
was specifically for kids

00:32:55.060 --> 00:32:56.610
on the spectrum was at Grattan.

00:32:58.430 --> 00:33:01.940
And here we are today at 1,241 kids.

00:33:01.940 --> 00:33:04.570
And we have autism-focused classes

00:33:04.570 --> 00:33:06.700
throughout the district now.

00:33:06.700 --> 00:33:09.080
It's on the rise, and
it's not just because

00:33:09.080 --> 00:33:11.270
we're better at diagnosing, trust me.

00:33:11.270 --> 00:33:14.240
I've spent the last 18 years of my life

00:33:14.240 --> 00:33:18.070
immersed in a K5 educational setting

00:33:18.070 --> 00:33:22.603
and I can tell you that Asperger's
and autism is increasing.

00:33:23.590 --> 00:33:25.313
Firsthand experience.

00:33:27.210 --> 00:33:30.800
Don't even argue with me.
(audience laughing)

00:33:30.800 --> 00:33:32.860
All right, the ethnicity of our students.

00:33:32.860 --> 00:33:36.090
And I had to put this in
because of my concerns

00:33:36.090 --> 00:33:38.420
around disproportionality.

00:33:38.420 --> 00:33:41.210
Back to the emotional
disturbed and the ACEs

00:33:41.210 --> 00:33:45.450
and we are just
overidentifying kids of color,

00:33:45.450 --> 00:33:48.110
and it's a problem in our district.

00:33:48.110 --> 00:33:51.980
At the same time, we can miss kids

00:33:51.980 --> 00:33:54.670
with discrete learning disabilities

00:33:54.670 --> 00:33:57.330
because we don't want to overidentify.

00:33:57.330 --> 00:33:59.008
We have a lot of work to do

00:33:59.008 --> 00:34:01.260
in the area of disproportionality.

00:34:01.260 --> 00:34:06.260
We're being watched by the
state, and we do a lot of work

00:34:06.260 --> 00:34:09.510
cross-departmentally to address this.

00:34:09.510 --> 00:34:10.990
Have we banged it home yet?

00:34:10.990 --> 00:34:13.713
No, I'm still in the game.

00:34:14.700 --> 00:34:17.146
There's a lot of people
who are focused on this,

00:34:17.146 --> 00:34:19.683
and we will continue to take it on.

00:34:22.720 --> 00:34:27.010
So, now that parents know
that they may have a kid

00:34:27.010 --> 00:34:30.370
who has been identified,
they have to enter

00:34:30.370 --> 00:34:33.500
into the world of special education.

00:34:33.500 --> 00:34:37.140
Our reputation is not
stellar, let's all face it.

00:34:37.140 --> 00:34:40.133
People talk about special
ed, I know they do.

00:34:41.122 --> 00:34:43.210
And so this is where I'm going to appeal

00:34:43.210 --> 00:34:44.543
to all of you today.

00:34:46.720 --> 00:34:50.270
Child Find, it's a
process that requires us

00:34:50.270 --> 00:34:53.020
to identify, locate, and
evaluate our children

00:34:53.020 --> 00:34:55.960
with disabilities residing
in our jurisdiction.

00:34:55.960 --> 00:34:58.180
The obligation includes all students

00:34:58.180 --> 00:35:00.850
who attend private
including religious schools,

00:35:00.850 --> 00:35:04.860
migrant or homeless students
who are wards of the State,

00:35:04.860 --> 00:35:06.860
and students with suspected disabilities

00:35:06.860 --> 00:35:09.383
who are still advancing in grade levels.

00:35:11.850 --> 00:35:15.680
I think it's worthy to note
that you're on the front lines.

00:35:15.680 --> 00:35:17.750
We went, that slide in the back,

00:35:17.750 --> 00:35:21.010
if you have even an inkling
of suspicion you should bust

00:35:21.010 --> 00:35:23.230
it out and you should write
a letter to the principal.

00:35:23.230 --> 00:35:27.743
You should encourage the
parents to get into the schools.

00:35:28.720 --> 00:35:31.930
Not every principal receives
those letters from doctors

00:35:31.930 --> 00:35:34.480
or parents in a way that's lawful

00:35:34.480 --> 00:35:37.510
because they're not schooled
correctly in the law.

00:35:37.510 --> 00:35:40.610
That's my job, it doesn't
mean that you don't do it

00:35:40.610 --> 00:35:43.633
or you get frustrated in the process.

00:35:44.740 --> 00:35:46.900
And later on in a couple more slides

00:35:46.900 --> 00:35:51.900
I'm gonna show you some
resources in the city

00:35:52.940 --> 00:35:55.460
that you should have on your Rolodex

00:35:55.460 --> 00:35:57.190
so that if a parent comes back to you

00:35:57.190 --> 00:35:59.410
and says they hit a snag
or they hit a roadblock

00:35:59.410 --> 00:36:01.700
or something didn't
happen, then you need to go

00:36:01.700 --> 00:36:06.323
to the next step and just
push and push and push.

00:36:07.340 --> 00:36:08.950
When we get a letter from a doctor

00:36:08.950 --> 00:36:11.510
that says do an assessment on this kid,

00:36:11.510 --> 00:36:13.330
more often than not,
I'll be honest with you,

00:36:13.330 --> 00:36:16.500
when you wrote letters to me
and told me about your patient

00:36:16.500 --> 00:36:18.750
and it was my kid I was like, mm-hmm.

00:36:18.750 --> 00:36:21.080
More than likely we had already
had a couple of meetings

00:36:21.080 --> 00:36:26.080
on the books and we were maybe
in process or ready to go.

00:36:26.710 --> 00:36:28.930
We're in cahoots, in other words.

00:36:28.930 --> 00:36:31.400
Very seldom does something
come out of left field,

00:36:31.400 --> 00:36:34.610
and I'm like, yeah, no, that's ridiculous.

00:36:34.610 --> 00:36:37.440
But if we did have that
feeling of, that's ridiculous

00:36:37.440 --> 00:36:40.889
we still by law have to
write that parent a letter

00:36:40.889 --> 00:36:44.580
saying this isn't going
to happen and this is why.

00:36:44.580 --> 00:36:45.990
And then of course we would go

00:36:45.990 --> 00:36:47.870
to the Alternative Dispute Resolution

00:36:47.870 --> 00:36:50.270
'cause the parent would say,
yes, I want this to happen.

00:36:50.270 --> 00:36:52.973
And eventually more than
likely it would happen.

00:36:58.251 --> 00:37:00.130
(coughs) Excuse me.

00:37:00.130 --> 00:37:02.870
So the referral, we just talked

00:37:02.870 --> 00:37:04.020
a little bit about the referral.

00:37:04.020 --> 00:37:07.460
Basically make the
referral, don't hold back.

00:37:07.460 --> 00:37:09.880
I'm moving a little quickly
because I want to make sure

00:37:09.880 --> 00:37:11.430
we have time for Q and A.

00:37:12.830 --> 00:37:15.210
Navigation is key, and this is, again,

00:37:15.210 --> 00:37:19.800
you're going to need a
support person along the way.

00:37:19.800 --> 00:37:24.300
So it's important that
you have those resources

00:37:24.300 --> 00:37:26.230
to direct parents accordingly.

00:37:26.230 --> 00:37:28.880
And I'm going to give you
some before we leave today.

00:37:30.100 --> 00:37:32.280
Anybody basically can
ask for an assessment.

00:37:32.280 --> 00:37:37.280
Obviously the parent,
a caregiver, a teacher,

00:37:37.860 --> 00:37:41.353
the principal, the doctor, all of that.

00:37:43.230 --> 00:37:46.220
A child, you know this, I
hope you know this already,

00:37:46.220 --> 00:37:48.810
but a child with a
disability may be eligible

00:37:48.810 --> 00:37:52.910
for special education if
they meet the criteria

00:37:52.910 --> 00:37:55.323
under one of these 13 disabilities.

00:38:00.040 --> 00:38:03.750
The IEP, the IEP.

00:38:03.750 --> 00:38:05.470
The bottom line is the IEP's the meeting

00:38:05.470 --> 00:38:07.070
where you all come to the table.

00:38:08.870 --> 00:38:10.980
Obviously I can't say that I've ever had

00:38:10.980 --> 00:38:13.860
a medical professional at the table.

00:38:13.860 --> 00:38:16.100
I have absolutely called a doctor.

00:38:16.100 --> 00:38:18.000
If I get a release of information,

00:38:18.000 --> 00:38:21.270
we'll skip over that slide,
it's a few more ahead.

00:38:21.270 --> 00:38:22.720
If I get the release of information,

00:38:22.720 --> 00:38:24.860
if a parent wants us
to talk to one another

00:38:24.860 --> 00:38:27.970
we absolutely will and we should.

00:38:27.970 --> 00:38:31.160
And all of your great
information will be considered

00:38:31.160 --> 00:38:33.320
and brought to the table
when we're creating

00:38:33.320 --> 00:38:35.440
a program for a child.

00:38:35.440 --> 00:38:38.350
An IEP is not just a
meeting, it's a process.

00:38:38.350 --> 00:38:41.220
Anybody on the team can
say it's time to meet again

00:38:41.220 --> 00:38:43.310
or I have some concerns or I'm not sure

00:38:43.310 --> 00:38:44.933
if that's an appropriate goal.

00:38:46.670 --> 00:38:49.840
So we try to consistently
bring the team together

00:38:52.320 --> 00:38:54.530
for what's right for a kid.

00:38:54.530 --> 00:38:57.370
So sometimes it can get nutty.

00:38:57.370 --> 00:38:59.500
People want part six, part seven.

00:38:59.500 --> 00:39:02.070
That's when we start to not get along

00:39:02.070 --> 00:39:03.230
very well with each other.

00:39:03.230 --> 00:39:05.090
There's a sweet spot in there.

00:39:05.090 --> 00:39:09.320
I would encourage parents
and educators to find

00:39:09.320 --> 00:39:13.903
the sweet spot so that we're
not burning each other out.

00:39:15.730 --> 00:39:19.640
Services, an IEP may include specialized

00:39:19.640 --> 00:39:21.960
academic instruction, related services,

00:39:21.960 --> 00:39:24.790
the use of supplementary
aids and services,

00:39:24.790 --> 00:39:28.330
curriculum accommodations and
modifications, which is huge

00:39:28.330 --> 00:39:30.916
and has been underutilized in my opinion.

00:39:30.916 --> 00:39:34.350
I want the teachers and the
principals at the schools

00:39:34.350 --> 00:39:38.920
to get more creative with
accommodations in the classroom.

00:39:38.920 --> 00:39:41.770
And a range of other services
individually designed

00:39:41.770 --> 00:39:43.903
to provide educational benefit.

00:39:46.350 --> 00:39:48.130
The least restrictive environment

00:39:48.130 --> 00:39:50.790
is the general education setting.

00:39:50.790 --> 00:39:54.683
We try, I think the next slide
sort of has a picture here.

00:39:56.490 --> 00:39:59.800
So the least restrictive is
gen ed with some supports,

00:39:59.800 --> 00:40:01.920
and then it's gen ed with some push-in

00:40:01.920 --> 00:40:05.720
with a special ed teacher
in the room helping out.

00:40:05.720 --> 00:40:08.530
The next level is general
ed where you get pulled out

00:40:08.530 --> 00:40:10.350
for some intervention, so maybe

00:40:10.350 --> 00:40:13.740
some daily reading intervention
to bolster your reading.

00:40:13.740 --> 00:40:15.360
We have self-contained classrooms

00:40:15.360 --> 00:40:17.750
where kids spend more
than 50% of their day

00:40:17.750 --> 00:40:20.960
in a special class, but we always should

00:40:20.960 --> 00:40:23.780
be pulling them out to the
greatest extent possible

00:40:23.780 --> 00:40:25.903
to be with their peers on the other end.

00:40:27.830 --> 00:40:29.860
There are special day schools.

00:40:29.860 --> 00:40:33.000
We don't have any
necessarily in our district

00:40:33.000 --> 00:40:36.940
but they are in the non-public range.

00:40:36.940 --> 00:40:38.740
That's our non-public schools.

00:40:38.740 --> 00:40:42.360
Some kids have to go to
residential treatment centers.

00:40:42.360 --> 00:40:45.250
I don't even want to discuss
detention facilities.

00:40:45.250 --> 00:40:50.220
I have had students go to
the Juvenile Justice Center.

00:40:50.220 --> 00:40:51.150
It breaks my heart.

00:40:51.150 --> 00:40:52.410
Luckily I'm a street soldier

00:40:52.410 --> 00:40:53.930
having worked with Joseph Marshall.

00:40:53.930 --> 00:40:55.260
Do you know Joe?

00:40:55.260 --> 00:40:57.140
Thank you, Street Soldier.

00:40:57.140 --> 00:41:00.360
Back in the day, that was
the best training I ever had.

00:41:00.360 --> 00:41:04.000
Training, I'm telling you
it's real, you know that.

00:41:04.000 --> 00:41:07.630
And lastly is hospital and homebound.

00:41:07.630 --> 00:41:09.050
And we work, when I was at Grattan

00:41:09.050 --> 00:41:11.970
we had a ton of kids up at UC up the hill

00:41:11.970 --> 00:41:15.240
in the oncology ward
where had siblings of kids

00:41:15.240 --> 00:41:18.980
in the oncology ward and we'd
hold spaces at Grattan school

00:41:18.980 --> 00:41:20.650
so the families could have access

00:41:20.650 --> 00:41:22.660
to a little neighborhood school.

00:41:22.660 --> 00:41:25.500
And so we did some great
work crossing over.

00:41:25.500 --> 00:41:28.593
I learned a lot about
what that's all about.

00:41:31.890 --> 00:41:33.920
So this just sort of spells out

00:41:33.920 --> 00:41:37.620
the greatest access to general ed.

00:41:37.620 --> 00:41:39.983
I'm gonna move on 'cause
we're almost done.

00:41:41.390 --> 00:41:44.010
All right, you guys need to know this.

00:41:44.010 --> 00:41:46.900
This is important for you
because you're on the front line

00:41:46.900 --> 00:41:50.120
with the parents, they
have to have meaningful

00:41:50.120 --> 00:41:53.500
parent participation, so you
need to school them on that

00:41:53.500 --> 00:41:56.370
and remind them that if
they're going into an IEP,

00:41:56.370 --> 00:41:59.610
remember my story when I talked too much.

00:41:59.610 --> 00:42:02.070
There are teachers out there
who are still talking too much

00:42:02.070 --> 00:42:04.680
'cause I haven't trained them yet.

00:42:04.680 --> 00:42:07.260
Parents trained me, I want
to be honest with you,

00:42:07.260 --> 00:42:09.020
the parents in this city have schooled me

00:42:09.020 --> 00:42:11.823
on so, so, so, so much in my career.

00:42:13.020 --> 00:42:16.230
So the parents can be
their own best advocate

00:42:16.230 --> 00:42:18.090
and say, it's my turn to talk,

00:42:18.090 --> 00:42:20.040
or you need to consider my input

00:42:20.893 --> 00:42:23.620
and kind of advocate for themselves.

00:42:23.620 --> 00:42:26.140
The next parent right
is prior written notice.

00:42:26.140 --> 00:42:30.990
If they ask for something we
need to write back to them.

00:42:30.990 --> 00:42:32.990
So for instance, that referral.

00:42:32.990 --> 00:42:34.600
If they want a referral and the school

00:42:34.600 --> 00:42:37.350
absolutely thinks there's
no referral necessary

00:42:37.350 --> 00:42:40.290
we don't just say no, we
have to write back to them

00:42:40.290 --> 00:42:45.290
officially and tell them why
we don't think it's necessary.

00:42:45.350 --> 00:42:48.040
If they ask for their own iPad

00:42:48.040 --> 00:42:50.060
and we don't think they
need their own iPad,

00:42:50.060 --> 00:42:52.550
which by the way, that's
not even an issue anymore

00:42:52.550 --> 00:42:54.100
'cause almost all kids have access

00:42:54.100 --> 00:42:56.640
to iPads all day now anyway.

00:42:56.640 --> 00:42:58.670
Anyway, we would write back to them.

00:42:58.670 --> 00:43:00.650
So prior written notice,

00:43:00.650 --> 00:43:02.883
they have to get
everything back in writing.

00:43:05.230 --> 00:43:07.400
And when there's a disagreement

00:43:07.400 --> 00:43:10.610
there is an absolute
avenue for them to take.

00:43:10.610 --> 00:43:13.903
It's called ADR, Alternative
Dispute Resolution.

00:43:17.310 --> 00:43:19.690
Progress monitoring, we already talked

00:43:19.690 --> 00:43:21.030
about the importance of that,

00:43:21.030 --> 00:43:23.280
so I'm not going to read that slide.

00:43:23.280 --> 00:43:26.467
You know that our job is
to monitor their progress

00:43:26.467 --> 00:43:29.450
and to readjust as necessary.

00:43:29.450 --> 00:43:33.230
If we're not progress monitoring
then we're breaking the law

00:43:33.230 --> 00:43:36.010
and you need to tell the
parent to call us out on that

00:43:36.010 --> 00:43:38.270
and then we're going
to come to an agreement

00:43:38.270 --> 00:43:39.993
of how to move forward together.

00:43:41.280 --> 00:43:44.980
Release of information can
go both ways obviously.

00:43:44.980 --> 00:43:47.190
So that needs to be a
thoughtful discussion

00:43:47.190 --> 00:43:49.410
with the parent as to whether or not

00:43:49.410 --> 00:43:51.223
you want to sign off on that.

00:43:53.100 --> 00:43:56.530
It has to do with trust, in my opinion.

00:43:56.530 --> 00:43:59.060
So if a family is feeling
that there's some trust

00:43:59.060 --> 00:44:02.630
on the other side at
the school, as I said,

00:44:02.630 --> 00:44:04.390
I was that special ed principal.

00:44:04.390 --> 00:44:07.020
I think I did gain the
trust of many of my families

00:44:07.020 --> 00:44:08.840
or if not, most of my families

00:44:08.840 --> 00:44:11.560
and we were able to do
great, great things together

00:44:11.560 --> 00:44:13.940
for their kids because
we trusted each other,

00:44:13.940 --> 00:44:15.240
but I don't take for granted

00:44:15.240 --> 00:44:17.110
that that isn't always the case.

00:44:17.110 --> 00:44:18.823
Just know that that's out there.

00:44:20.030 --> 00:44:22.160
I have three final slides.

00:44:22.160 --> 00:44:24.970
I'm part of Our Children
Our Families Council

00:44:24.970 --> 00:44:27.140
in San Francisco, are
you familiar with that

00:44:27.140 --> 00:44:29.560
at all Chief Scott?

00:44:29.560 --> 00:44:32.640
It's a coming together of city agencies.

00:44:32.640 --> 00:44:35.580
It's basically the major
and the superintendent,

00:44:35.580 --> 00:44:39.120
and we're popping out certain issues

00:44:39.120 --> 00:44:42.920
and we're wrapping around
it as a city together.

00:44:42.920 --> 00:44:46.550
We've been looking at attendance
since I've been chief.

00:44:46.550 --> 00:44:48.360
That's another 20-slide presentation.

00:44:48.360 --> 00:44:51.510
We have a huge attendance
issue in this school district

00:44:51.510 --> 00:44:54.210
predominantly among
children with disabilities

00:44:54.210 --> 00:44:56.950
and children of color, it's not OK.

00:44:56.950 --> 00:44:58.950
We can't teach 'em if they're not there.

00:45:00.690 --> 00:45:05.230
This is me, Special Education Department.

00:45:05.230 --> 00:45:06.910
That is the main phone number.

00:45:06.910 --> 00:45:09.380
For years when you called
that number nobody answered

00:45:09.380 --> 00:45:14.380
or it went into some
byzantine, horrible place.

00:45:14.520 --> 00:45:17.230
I actually should've put
my cell phone down there.

00:45:17.230 --> 00:45:19.010
I would've done that
'cause I don't answer it.

00:45:19.010 --> 00:45:23.430
I always just retrieve
messages unless a name pops up.

00:45:23.430 --> 00:45:27.523
I hate ringing phones, it's my ADHD.

00:45:28.730 --> 00:45:33.730
Anyway, we're on the website,
RobertsonJ1 is my email,

00:45:34.920 --> 00:45:39.920
RobertsonJ1@sfusd.edu, we
can talk about that more.

00:45:41.620 --> 00:45:43.763
This is the slide that you need to have.

00:45:45.830 --> 00:45:48.650
This is an absolute must.

00:45:48.650 --> 00:45:51.423
And our Support For Families
partners are in the house.

00:45:52.342 --> 00:45:55.260
Woo-hoo!

00:45:55.260 --> 00:45:57.700
Yep, they do deserve.
(audience clapping)

00:45:57.700 --> 00:45:59.460
They are the hardest working people.

00:45:59.460 --> 00:46:02.590
And I love, it doesn't say
hotline, it says warmline

00:46:02.590 --> 00:46:04.090
because they are warm demanders.

00:46:04.090 --> 00:46:06.960
They're so forgiving, but
they're fierce advocates

00:46:06.960 --> 00:46:09.380
at the same time, that's a
dance, that's a fine line

00:46:09.380 --> 00:46:10.417
and they're great at it.

00:46:10.417 --> 00:46:11.630
And this is who you call

00:46:11.630 --> 00:46:14.111
when you don't get answers from us, OK.

00:46:14.111 --> 00:46:15.916
- [Woman] And also parents of--

00:46:15.916 --> 00:46:19.100
(shuffling papers drowns out speaker)

00:46:19.100 --> 00:46:21.450
- And so this is my final slide.

00:46:21.450 --> 00:46:22.283
- [Woman] That's good.

00:46:22.283 --> 00:46:24.130
- Your timing is perfect.

00:46:24.130 --> 00:46:26.690
So I just want you to
know that this little guy

00:46:26.690 --> 00:46:31.530
is doing a time out, and
he is chewing a chew stick

00:46:31.530 --> 00:46:35.690
as you can see, and he's
absolutely fine and happy

00:46:35.690 --> 00:46:38.130
and got right back into the class,

00:46:38.130 --> 00:46:40.940
but this isn't acceptable
on so many levels

00:46:40.940 --> 00:46:44.820
and in so many schools, and
so it needs to be acceptable

00:46:44.820 --> 00:46:46.600
because that's what he
needed in the moment.

00:46:46.600 --> 00:46:49.610
His time out needed to be
upside down with a chew stick.

00:46:49.610 --> 00:46:52.980
So just remember, accommodations are key.

00:46:52.980 --> 00:46:55.210
I'm sorry I had to go a
little fast at the end,

00:46:55.210 --> 00:46:57.290
but I want to thank you for your attention

00:46:57.290 --> 00:46:59.287
and I'm happy to be a partner
with you in this work.

00:46:59.287 --> 00:47:02.454
(audience applauding)
