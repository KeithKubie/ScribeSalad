[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:00:06.049 --> 00:00:07.340
ANDREW BROGDON: Hey, everybody.

00:00:07.340 --> 00:00:09.730
We're back and we're here
with Eric Seidel, one

00:00:09.730 --> 00:00:12.010
of the leaders for
the Flutter project,

00:00:12.010 --> 00:00:13.750
one of the founders
of the project,

00:00:13.750 --> 00:00:15.000
here to answer some questions.

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:16.958
And I have a few [INAUDIBLE]
questions already.

00:00:16.958 --> 00:00:19.390
Wm is still taking a
look at the stream.

00:00:19.390 --> 00:00:21.226
And so let's start off.

00:00:21.226 --> 00:00:22.600
Can you tell us
a little bit more

00:00:22.600 --> 00:00:24.190
about the Flutter origin story?

00:00:24.190 --> 00:00:27.160
Because I've told it to people,
Flutter started as a quest

00:00:27.160 --> 00:00:30.466
for speed, and I'd love to
know that I'm not lying.

00:00:30.466 --> 00:00:32.049
ERIC SEIDEL: No,
that's totally right.

00:00:32.049 --> 00:00:34.210
Flutter did start as
a quest for speed.

00:00:34.210 --> 00:00:37.180
So Flutter, in its very
earliest incarnation,

00:00:37.180 --> 00:00:40.180
was just a very cut
down version of Chrome.

00:00:40.180 --> 00:00:42.850
We took Chrome and we
just allowed ourselves

00:00:42.850 --> 00:00:46.912
to break compatibility with the
web and chop out lots of stuff

00:00:46.912 --> 00:00:48.370
and see how fast
we can make it go.

00:00:48.370 --> 00:00:49.120
ANDREW BROGDON: Things
that were in there

00:00:49.120 --> 00:00:50.770
for older standards,
compatibility

00:00:50.770 --> 00:00:51.520
with older things?

00:00:51.520 --> 00:00:53.230
ERIC SEIDEL: Just
all sorts of things.

00:00:53.230 --> 00:00:57.410
The thing that we built wasn't
able to render any web pages,

00:00:57.410 --> 00:00:58.960
but it could run our benchmarks.

00:00:58.960 --> 00:01:02.240
And when we ran our benchmarks,
they were 20 times faster,

00:01:02.240 --> 00:01:05.185
and so we knew we
had something there.

00:01:05.185 --> 00:01:07.060
ANDREW BROGDON: So you
had a rendering engine

00:01:07.060 --> 00:01:08.440
and then I've
heard that was sort

00:01:08.440 --> 00:01:11.365
of a search for a
language at that point.

00:01:11.365 --> 00:01:12.490
Can you tell us about that?

00:01:12.490 --> 00:01:14.200
At one point, Flutter was
written in JavaScript,

00:01:14.200 --> 00:01:14.900
is that right?

00:01:14.900 --> 00:01:15.983
ERIC SEIDEL: That's right.

00:01:15.983 --> 00:01:18.310
So we actually went
through several iterations.

00:01:18.310 --> 00:01:19.780
We did have a rendering engine.

00:01:19.780 --> 00:01:22.690
It was all in C++ originally,
and then we started writing

00:01:22.690 --> 00:01:24.437
more and more JavaScript code.

00:01:24.437 --> 00:01:26.770
Eventually, we had some trouble
with the JavaScript code

00:01:26.770 --> 00:01:30.040
and so we went searching for
another language, and then,

00:01:30.040 --> 00:01:33.440
eventually, all the C++
died away, or most of it.

00:01:33.440 --> 00:01:36.730
And once we found Dart, and
that worked so well for us,

00:01:36.730 --> 00:01:38.948
we just wrote more and
more and more Dart code.

00:01:38.948 --> 00:01:40.660
ANDREW BROGDON: OK, cool.

00:01:40.660 --> 00:01:43.796
And where did Flutter,
the name, come from?

00:01:43.796 --> 00:01:45.170
I saw that in the
stream earlier.

00:01:45.170 --> 00:01:46.660
Where did the name
Flutter come from?

00:01:46.660 --> 00:01:48.868
WM LELER: And we've actually
heard this story before,

00:01:48.868 --> 00:01:51.100
but it's so good, we
have to hear it again.

00:01:51.100 --> 00:01:54.980
ERIC SEIDEL: So it turns
out, naming is really hard.

00:01:54.980 --> 00:01:58.090
So we did these things called
trademark searches, where

00:01:58.090 --> 00:02:01.630
you make sure that you can use
the name in various countries,

00:02:01.630 --> 00:02:03.200
and all that.

00:02:03.200 --> 00:02:05.950
And they're not cheap and
they take a long time.

00:02:05.950 --> 00:02:07.600
And we did a bunch
of them and we

00:02:07.600 --> 00:02:11.500
didn't find any names that
we liked that you could use.

00:02:11.500 --> 00:02:13.440
And so we got a
little desperate.

00:02:13.440 --> 00:02:17.800
But it turns out that
Google has a cache of names

00:02:17.800 --> 00:02:20.410
from companies that they
bought and they're not using.

00:02:20.410 --> 00:02:21.650
ANDREW BROGDON: Previously
acquired companies.

00:02:21.650 --> 00:02:22.870
ERIC SEIDEL: Yeah, or
they turned down a name,

00:02:22.870 --> 00:02:23.872
for whatever reason.

00:02:23.872 --> 00:02:25.330
And that's where
Flutter came from.

00:02:25.330 --> 00:02:28.660
It was a small startup
that they had bought.

00:02:28.660 --> 00:02:32.420
And the product had turned down
but the name was still there,

00:02:32.420 --> 00:02:34.730
and that's how we
ended up being Flutter.

00:02:34.730 --> 00:02:36.640
WM LELER: That is wild.

00:02:36.640 --> 00:02:40.790
ANDREW BROGDON: All right,
we've got another question here.

00:02:40.790 --> 00:02:42.230
This one comes from Twitter.

00:02:42.230 --> 00:02:46.630
The account is [INAUDIBLE]
from [INAUDIBLE] in Romania.

00:02:46.630 --> 00:02:49.670
So [SPEAKING ROMANIAN].

00:02:49.670 --> 00:02:52.060
Can you talk a little bit
about the evolution of Dart

00:02:52.060 --> 00:02:53.890
and how Flutter
influenced, perhaps,

00:02:53.890 --> 00:02:56.277
some of the features
that were in Dart 2.0?

00:02:56.277 --> 00:02:58.360
So were there things that
Flutter needed from Dart

00:02:58.360 --> 00:03:01.010
that the Dart team then
came back and said,

00:03:01.010 --> 00:03:03.409
yeah, we can put those
in the language for you.

00:03:03.409 --> 00:03:04.450
ERIC SEIDEL: Oh, totally.

00:03:04.450 --> 00:03:06.520
There's so much
that's been added

00:03:06.520 --> 00:03:09.190
to Dart in the last
few years, specifically

00:03:09.190 --> 00:03:13.600
for Flutter, the trailing
comments for the formatting,

00:03:13.600 --> 00:03:17.470
the [? intadouble, ?] the
EOT support, in general.

00:03:17.470 --> 00:03:19.060
That was a huge
feature that was done

00:03:19.060 --> 00:03:22.330
by the Dart team for Flutter.

00:03:22.330 --> 00:03:26.860
Lots of Flutter-specific
performance enhancements.

00:03:26.860 --> 00:03:31.060
Yeah, just lots and lots of work
that's gone into Dart to make

00:03:31.060 --> 00:03:33.289
Flutter an awesome.

00:03:33.289 --> 00:03:34.080
ANDREW BROGDON: OK.

00:03:34.080 --> 00:03:35.520
Let's see.

00:03:35.520 --> 00:03:37.220
So this one comes
also from Twitter.

00:03:37.220 --> 00:03:40.490
This is from Tara
[? Fuelles ?] 30.

00:03:40.490 --> 00:03:44.720
Will Google introduce a
Flutter certification program,

00:03:44.720 --> 00:03:48.479
similar to ones that
exist for Android?

00:03:48.479 --> 00:03:50.020
ERIC SEIDEL: So I've
heard that there

00:03:50.020 --> 00:03:52.050
are these other
certification programs

00:03:52.050 --> 00:03:54.699
for the other products,
which is awesome.

00:03:54.699 --> 00:03:56.740
I think that those are
things that we would think

00:03:56.740 --> 00:03:58.280
about a little bit later on.

00:03:58.280 --> 00:04:01.070
I mean, we just hit 1.0 today.

00:04:01.070 --> 00:04:02.590
So I think it's a
good idea, but I

00:04:02.590 --> 00:04:04.836
think that's probably going
to take a little while.

00:04:04.836 --> 00:04:05.627
ANDREW BROGDON: OK.

00:04:05.627 --> 00:04:07.000
Cool.

00:04:07.000 --> 00:04:10.090
And this is one last one,
sort of a general question

00:04:10.090 --> 00:04:13.150
for a lot of people watching.

00:04:13.150 --> 00:04:16.110
How can someone looking
to contribute to Flutter

00:04:16.110 --> 00:04:17.180
best make an impact?

00:04:17.180 --> 00:04:18.610
So if you're watching
this and you're like,

00:04:18.610 --> 00:04:19.526
I really like Flutter.

00:04:19.526 --> 00:04:20.839
I like this community.

00:04:20.839 --> 00:04:23.150
I would like to be part
of it as a contributor.

00:04:23.150 --> 00:04:26.610
What are some of the
best ways to do that?

00:04:26.610 --> 00:04:29.426
WM LELER: Other than the fact
that you're hiring, right?

00:04:29.426 --> 00:04:31.030
ERIC SEIDEL: And it's true.

00:04:31.030 --> 00:04:32.620
We are always hiring.

00:04:32.620 --> 00:04:35.794
We have tons of open positions.

00:04:35.794 --> 00:04:37.210
To contribute to
Flutter, so we do

00:04:37.210 --> 00:04:40.960
have a bunch of documentation
on GitHub about exactly this.

00:04:40.960 --> 00:04:42.820
And there are lots
of ways to contribute

00:04:42.820 --> 00:04:45.010
beyond just human engineering.

00:04:45.010 --> 00:04:47.500
There's tons of triage to do.

00:04:47.500 --> 00:04:49.440
All these people who
are running events today

00:04:49.440 --> 00:04:50.560
in support of Flutter.

00:04:50.560 --> 00:04:54.040
That's contributing
to the system, right?

00:04:54.040 --> 00:04:57.160
So yeah, there's lots of
engineering-specific tasks

00:04:57.160 --> 00:04:58.635
that are listed on GitHub.

00:04:58.635 --> 00:04:59.520
Bugs are fixed.

00:04:59.520 --> 00:05:02.420
We even have an easy fix
label, helping with early bugs.

00:05:02.420 --> 00:05:05.470
There's these contributing
docs on both the engine side,

00:05:05.470 --> 00:05:11.560
for those who like C++, as well
as the Flutter framework side,

00:05:11.560 --> 00:05:13.060
for those who like Dart.

00:05:13.060 --> 00:05:15.480
There's lots of docs up on
GitHub about exactly this.

00:05:15.480 --> 00:05:16.180
ANDREW BROGDON: OK, great.

00:05:16.180 --> 00:05:16.450
Yeah.

00:05:16.450 --> 00:05:18.325
And of course, we have
the package ecosystem,

00:05:18.325 --> 00:05:19.610
and all sorts of stuff, right?

00:05:19.610 --> 00:05:20.040
ERIC SEIDEL: Exactly.

00:05:20.040 --> 00:05:20.920
ANDREW BROGDON: OK.

00:05:20.920 --> 00:05:22.270
Excellent.

00:05:22.270 --> 00:05:24.065
So that's about all
of our time, I think.

00:05:24.065 --> 00:05:25.690
Do we have any other
questions for Eric

00:05:25.690 --> 00:05:26.390
that we wanted to touch on?

00:05:26.390 --> 00:05:28.270
WM LELER: That's all the
questions I wanted to ask.

00:05:28.270 --> 00:05:30.353
ANDREW BROGDON: We've
pretty much run out of time.

00:05:30.353 --> 00:05:32.350
Thank you so much for
joining us and talking

00:05:32.350 --> 00:05:35.640
to everybody on our screen, and
enjoy the rest of Flutter Live.

00:05:35.640 --> 00:05:37.140
ERIC SEIDEL: Thanks
for inviting me.

00:05:37.140 --> 00:05:38.250
WM LELER: [INAUDIBLE].

00:05:38.250 --> 00:05:40.000
ANDREW BROGDON: You
can take that with you

00:05:40.000 --> 00:05:41.680
and exit right out there.

00:05:41.680 --> 00:05:42.430
Thank you so much.

00:05:44.932 --> 00:05:45.515
That was cool.

00:05:45.515 --> 00:05:47.830
WM LELER: Well, I've got
a couple of questions.

00:05:47.830 --> 00:05:49.950
ANDREW BROGDON: What
else do we have?

00:05:49.950 --> 00:05:52.190
WM LELER: Well, let
me ask this one.

00:05:52.190 --> 00:05:54.365
This is a question.

00:05:54.365 --> 00:05:57.110
It says, "can we
design and develop

00:05:57.110 --> 00:06:01.430
apps for e-commerce
businesses with Flutter?

00:06:01.430 --> 00:06:03.390
This is one of those
questions where

00:06:03.390 --> 00:06:06.490
I didn't have to pay the person
to ask this, but I would have.

00:06:06.490 --> 00:06:09.010
ANDREW BROGDON: The answer is
people are already doing it,

00:06:09.010 --> 00:06:09.270
right?

00:06:09.270 --> 00:06:10.228
WM LELER: That's right.

00:06:10.228 --> 00:06:11.938
ANDREW BROGDON:
You know Alibaba.

00:06:11.938 --> 00:06:14.250
WM LELER: Yeah, Alibaba
is one of the largest

00:06:14.250 --> 00:06:15.764
e-commerce companies
in the world

00:06:15.764 --> 00:06:17.430
and they're using
Flutter for their app.

00:06:17.430 --> 00:06:19.380
ANDREW BROGDON: Absolutely.

00:06:19.380 --> 00:06:20.760
We have a sample [INAUDIBLE].

00:06:20.760 --> 00:06:21.718
WM LELER: That's right.

00:06:21.718 --> 00:06:23.177
ANDREW BROGDON: OK.

00:06:23.177 --> 00:06:24.260
WM LELER: Can we see that?

00:06:24.260 --> 00:06:25.251
ANDREW BROGDON: Yes.

00:06:25.251 --> 00:06:27.750
If you watched the keynote, you
already saw it a little bit.

00:06:27.750 --> 00:06:29.280
Let me go ahead and pull up--

00:06:29.280 --> 00:06:30.238
WM LELER: That's right.

00:06:30.238 --> 00:06:32.610
When Will got up and talked
about Material Design.

00:06:32.610 --> 00:06:34.860
ANDREW BROGDON: Let me get
this zoomed in so everybody

00:06:34.860 --> 00:06:35.530
can see it.

00:06:35.530 --> 00:06:39.810
WM LELER: And it has
e-commerce app built into it.

00:06:39.810 --> 00:06:42.660
ANDREW BROGDON: The Material
team built several samples

00:06:42.660 --> 00:06:45.220
to show off what Material could
do, the new stuff launching

00:06:45.220 --> 00:06:48.750
IOAT and how well you can
put it to work in Flutter.

00:06:48.750 --> 00:06:50.980
And one of their
demos is Shrine,

00:06:50.980 --> 00:06:52.770
which is a shopping app.

00:06:52.770 --> 00:06:55.030
And so we took the work that
they did and we're like,

00:06:55.030 --> 00:06:57.280
hey, let's put a little
state management into this.

00:06:57.280 --> 00:06:59.380
And we made a new
scoped_model with it

00:06:59.380 --> 00:07:02.160
and put a shopping
cart into it and put it

00:07:02.160 --> 00:07:03.650
on the DevRel samples repo.

00:07:03.650 --> 00:07:06.845
So it's up at flutter/samples,
samples, so look for Shrine

00:07:06.845 --> 00:07:09.160
and you could download
that right now.

00:07:09.160 --> 00:07:12.520
And if we go to my
left-- here we go.

00:07:12.520 --> 00:07:15.020
Gradle's just about done.

00:07:15.020 --> 00:07:19.150
This is an example
of an e-commerce app.

00:07:19.150 --> 00:07:21.305
So I could just click
through Next here.

00:07:21.305 --> 00:07:22.350
You get right on.

00:07:22.350 --> 00:07:26.210
So we have a list of products,
just like you would expect.

00:07:26.210 --> 00:07:28.260
I think Will is himself.

00:07:28.260 --> 00:07:31.072
Yes, he is in here
himself as a model.

00:07:31.072 --> 00:07:32.530
Because we needed
a model that day,

00:07:32.530 --> 00:07:34.699
I guess, for the photos team.

00:07:34.699 --> 00:07:36.490
And so you can click
on things and add them

00:07:36.490 --> 00:07:37.360
to your shopping cart.

00:07:37.360 --> 00:07:38.860
And you can see the
Material team, of course,

00:07:38.860 --> 00:07:40.480
has put a lot of time into this.

00:07:40.480 --> 00:07:42.899
The expanding bottom
sheet, for the preview

00:07:42.899 --> 00:07:44.440
of what's in the
cart, I know they're

00:07:44.440 --> 00:07:47.027
very proud of because
it looks so cool.

00:07:47.027 --> 00:07:48.610
But you can add
things just like that.

00:07:48.610 --> 00:07:52.166
I can click on the bottom sheets
and it expands into the carts.

00:07:52.166 --> 00:07:54.040
I can come in here and
take things out of it.

00:07:54.040 --> 00:07:56.970
There's a model, managing the
state of what's in the cart,

00:07:56.970 --> 00:07:59.410
tallying up things.

00:07:59.410 --> 00:08:01.660
But yeah, obviously,
e-commerce is a huge sector

00:08:01.660 --> 00:08:03.757
of the mobile app ecosystem.

00:08:03.757 --> 00:08:04.590
It's very important.

00:08:04.590 --> 00:08:08.200
So certainly, Flutter,
the team had that mind

00:08:08.200 --> 00:08:11.090
as they were building
everything out for Flutter.

00:08:11.090 --> 00:08:12.520
Yeah, works great.

00:08:15.290 --> 00:08:16.960
What else we got?

00:08:16.960 --> 00:08:18.790
WM LELER: I've got
some live questions.

00:08:18.790 --> 00:08:19.700
ANDREW BROGDON: OK.

00:08:19.700 --> 00:08:20.783
WM LELER: Let me pick one.

00:08:23.710 --> 00:08:27.310
Is there a way to
embed native UI?

00:08:27.310 --> 00:08:30.940
And the example they use, can
I put Apple Pay into an app

00:08:30.940 --> 00:08:34.695
and have a Flutter button
that invokes Apple Pay?

00:08:34.695 --> 00:08:35.570
ANDREW BROGDON: Sure.

00:08:35.570 --> 00:08:37.319
Yeah, we can talk a
little bit about that.

00:08:37.319 --> 00:08:39.520
So the Google Maps
plugin, you already

00:08:39.520 --> 00:08:41.740
saw that Phil had demonstrated.

00:08:41.740 --> 00:08:45.460
That's using under the hood
something called PlatformView.

00:08:45.460 --> 00:08:48.580
And so PlatformView,
there is an Android view.

00:08:48.580 --> 00:08:50.110
And there's a UIKit view.

00:08:50.110 --> 00:08:53.200
And these are the widgets
that sort of manage

00:08:53.200 --> 00:08:55.420
a platform, a
native PlatformView,

00:08:55.420 --> 00:08:57.670
and fit it into the
world of Flutter.

00:08:57.670 --> 00:08:59.830
And so those are available.

00:08:59.830 --> 00:09:02.620
You could do it and try
them out on your view

00:09:02.620 --> 00:09:04.360
and see how that goes.

00:09:04.360 --> 00:09:06.310
There's a bit of a
cost to the work they

00:09:06.310 --> 00:09:08.590
have to do under the
hood, so I wouldn't just

00:09:08.590 --> 00:09:10.800
start throwing 30 of them
into every Flutter screen

00:09:10.800 --> 00:09:11.985
that you have that.

00:09:11.985 --> 00:09:13.610
That wouldn't be a
good implementation.

00:09:13.610 --> 00:09:15.651
But if you have one specific
view that you really

00:09:15.651 --> 00:09:18.370
need to have, like a
control that you've

00:09:18.370 --> 00:09:19.900
invested a lot of
time in building,

00:09:19.900 --> 00:09:22.030
or something for the
platform, you really

00:09:22.030 --> 00:09:24.646
need a particular piece
of the platform live,

00:09:24.646 --> 00:09:26.020
those have been
added now and you

00:09:26.020 --> 00:09:30.360
can start putting them to
work in your Flutter apps,

00:09:30.360 --> 00:09:32.534
PlatformViews.

00:09:32.534 --> 00:09:33.950
WM LELER: I have
another question.

00:09:33.950 --> 00:09:35.459
This is from Seattle.

00:09:35.459 --> 00:09:36.250
ANDREW BROGDON: Oh.

00:09:36.250 --> 00:09:38.680
WM LELER: So another
question from the US.

00:09:38.680 --> 00:09:42.910
They're wondering if there
are any continuous integration

00:09:42.910 --> 00:09:45.640
and continuous deployment
options for Flutter apps.

00:09:45.640 --> 00:09:47.015
ANDREW BROGDON:
So I think we got

00:09:47.015 --> 00:09:49.600
scooped a little bit
by the keynote, right?

00:09:49.600 --> 00:09:51.640
So yeah, obviously,
[INAUDIBLE] code.

00:09:51.640 --> 00:09:54.097
In the keynote, you saw
their solution for this.

00:09:54.097 --> 00:09:55.180
They partnered with this--

00:09:55.180 --> 00:09:57.130
WM LELER: This actually
came in after the keynote.

00:09:57.130 --> 00:09:57.610
ANDREW BROGDON:
Maybe they wanted

00:09:57.610 --> 00:09:59.151
to know what the
whole landscape was.

00:09:59.151 --> 00:10:00.370
WM LELER: Yeah, OK.

00:10:00.370 --> 00:10:01.720
ANDREW BROGDON: There are more.

00:10:01.720 --> 00:10:03.219
For our DevRel
samples, for example,

00:10:03.219 --> 00:10:08.290
we use Travis, because it's
free, for open-source projects.

00:10:08.290 --> 00:10:09.910
And it works great with Flutter.

00:10:09.910 --> 00:10:11.620
There's also
[? Sirius, ?] I believe,

00:10:11.620 --> 00:10:14.650
the engineering team
uses for the SDK itself.

00:10:14.650 --> 00:10:18.160
They have some really intense
use cases for advanced testing,

00:10:18.160 --> 00:10:21.800
and they have found that
fits their particular needs.

00:10:21.800 --> 00:10:24.910
But yeah, I mean, the tools
for Flutter, they run on Linux.

00:10:24.910 --> 00:10:26.210
They run on the command line.

00:10:26.210 --> 00:10:28.910
You can run tests from the
command line very easily.

00:10:28.910 --> 00:10:33.574
So they fit very well
into the CI/CD systems.

00:10:33.574 --> 00:10:34.240
WM LELER: Right.

00:10:34.240 --> 00:10:36.330
But I don't think
that's a problem at all.

00:10:36.330 --> 00:10:39.280
And I'm sure there's going
to be additional runs.

00:10:39.280 --> 00:10:41.440
One thing that we keep
wanting to point out

00:10:41.440 --> 00:10:45.820
is that if there's something you
want that is not available yet,

00:10:45.820 --> 00:10:48.850
you can actually go in and
file an issue for Flutter.

00:10:48.850 --> 00:10:50.760
ANDREW BROGDON:
That is true, yeah.

00:10:50.760 --> 00:10:53.212
It's not only is Flutter
open, in terms of the code

00:10:53.212 --> 00:10:55.420
and being able to see it,
it's developed in the open.

00:10:55.420 --> 00:10:57.759
So you can actually
go in and take a look

00:10:57.759 --> 00:10:59.050
at what the team is working on.

00:10:59.050 --> 00:10:59.110
WM LELER: That's right.

00:10:59.110 --> 00:11:00.480
You can do it yourself.

00:11:00.480 --> 00:11:02.021
ANDREW BROGDON: You
can also do that.

00:11:02.021 --> 00:11:04.220
WM LELER: Yeah, that's good.

00:11:04.220 --> 00:11:06.190
Well, here's a short one.

00:11:06.190 --> 00:11:08.305
How about Dart on
the server side?

00:11:08.305 --> 00:11:10.430
ANDREW BROGDON: We kind of
already touched on that.

00:11:10.430 --> 00:11:12.305
WM LELER: I know, we
already touched on that.

00:11:12.305 --> 00:11:15.660
But yes, and you can see that--

00:11:15.660 --> 00:11:17.740
I said that question
just because I

00:11:17.740 --> 00:11:21.080
wanted to emphasize that Dart
is a general purpose programming

00:11:21.080 --> 00:11:23.290
language.

00:11:23.290 --> 00:11:27.730
I mean, as you said earlier,
we are focusing on mobile apps

00:11:27.730 --> 00:11:29.350
right now, but
there are people who

00:11:29.350 --> 00:11:33.710
use Dart, including us, on the
server who use it for web apps,

00:11:33.710 --> 00:11:34.360
and so forth.

00:11:34.360 --> 00:11:36.610
And you've seen some of
that come out this time,

00:11:36.610 --> 00:11:38.480
and I think it's only
going to get better.

00:11:38.480 --> 00:11:40.270
And in fact, you're
going to start

00:11:40.270 --> 00:11:42.590
seeing it on more and
more devices as well.

00:11:46.730 --> 00:11:48.760
In fact, let me
continue with this one.

00:11:48.760 --> 00:11:50.560
Here's a question from India.

00:11:50.560 --> 00:11:52.660
It says, what are
the new widgets that

00:11:52.660 --> 00:11:55.360
are about to come out in
the next Flutter update?

00:11:55.360 --> 00:11:56.050
I love that.

00:11:56.050 --> 00:11:56.925
ANDREW BROGDON: Sure.

00:11:56.925 --> 00:11:58.876
Let's touch on this.

00:11:58.876 --> 00:12:01.776
Let me go into our--

00:12:01.776 --> 00:12:03.650
so the easiest way to
know what the Flutter--

00:12:03.650 --> 00:12:05.350
because we get this a lot,
what's the team working on?

00:12:05.350 --> 00:12:06.480
What's coming out soon?

00:12:06.480 --> 00:12:10.450
And the easiest way is to bypass
us and go straight to the team

00:12:10.450 --> 00:12:11.560
itself through GitHub.

00:12:11.560 --> 00:12:17.350
So if I go to the main
Flutter repo here,

00:12:17.350 --> 00:12:20.530
you'll notice open issues for
feature requests and bug fixes.

00:12:20.530 --> 00:12:22.700
You can take a look at those.

00:12:22.700 --> 00:12:25.360
But there's also the projects
tab, which the team uses.

00:12:25.360 --> 00:12:29.050
So you can see what they're
working on in real time.

00:12:29.050 --> 00:12:31.545
The IAP plugin you can see here.

00:12:31.545 --> 00:12:32.920
There's a lot of
stuff being done

00:12:32.920 --> 00:12:37.330
with Cupertino by Joe and Matt,
the engineers working on that.

00:12:37.330 --> 00:12:39.480
Add2App, you can see
the work on that.

00:12:39.480 --> 00:12:41.244
It's nearing the
end of its sprint.

00:12:41.244 --> 00:12:42.160
And some other things.

00:12:42.160 --> 00:12:43.417
You can come in here.

00:12:43.417 --> 00:12:46.000
You yourself can come in, just
see what the team is working on

00:12:46.000 --> 00:12:47.770
and that might well
answer your question.

00:12:47.770 --> 00:12:51.860
If you don't see the thing that
you think is really important,

00:12:51.860 --> 00:12:53.780
there's likely an issue
open for it already.

00:12:53.780 --> 00:12:55.000
If not, you can create one.

00:12:55.000 --> 00:12:57.367
If there is one, go in and
put a comment on it and say,

00:12:57.367 --> 00:12:58.450
I'm building with Flutter.

00:12:58.450 --> 00:13:02.020
This is important to me because
I need it for this use case.

00:13:02.020 --> 00:13:03.370
You can put a thumb up on it.

00:13:03.370 --> 00:13:05.646
The team really
loves that feedback.

00:13:05.646 --> 00:13:07.270
They really like
getting that and being

00:13:07.270 --> 00:13:09.228
able to feel like they're
staying close to what

00:13:09.228 --> 00:13:10.220
the community needs.

00:13:10.220 --> 00:13:11.599
So it's very valuable for them.

00:13:11.599 --> 00:13:13.390
WM LELER: So I'm going
to change gears just

00:13:13.390 --> 00:13:15.730
a little bit because
I just noticed

00:13:15.730 --> 00:13:16.772
somebody standing nearby.

00:13:16.772 --> 00:13:17.563
ANDREW BROGDON: OK.

00:13:17.563 --> 00:13:18.370
Who have we got?

00:13:18.370 --> 00:13:19.450
WM LELER: Let me read
the question first.

00:13:19.450 --> 00:13:20.533
ANDREW BROGDON: All right.

00:13:20.533 --> 00:13:22.060
WM LELER: So the
question is, what

00:13:22.060 --> 00:13:26.130
is the best way to achieve state
management in a Flutter app?

00:13:26.130 --> 00:13:27.570
ANDREW BROGDON: That's Filip.

00:13:27.570 --> 00:13:29.361
WM LELER: Well, let me
finish the question.

00:13:29.361 --> 00:13:31.470
It says, they're currently
using scoped_model,

00:13:31.470 --> 00:13:34.857
but it seems like it is maybe
not the best fit for their app.

00:13:34.857 --> 00:13:36.940
So they want to know what's
the right thing to do.

00:13:36.940 --> 00:13:38.070
ANDREW BROGDON: Filip,
come and join us.

00:13:38.070 --> 00:13:38.850
WM LELER: Yeah, Mr.--

00:13:38.850 --> 00:13:41.183
ANDREW BROGDON: You are the
perfect person for this one.

00:13:41.183 --> 00:13:42.480
WM LELER: We have Filip here.

00:13:42.480 --> 00:13:43.020
FILIP HRACEK: Hey.

00:13:43.020 --> 00:13:44.640
ANDREW BROGDON: Fresh from
the keynote, this is Filip,

00:13:44.640 --> 00:13:46.520
everybody, one of our
DevRel compatriates.

00:13:46.520 --> 00:13:48.870
WM LELER: I think they
already known him.

00:13:48.870 --> 00:13:49.380
ANDREW BROGDON: Careful there.

00:13:49.380 --> 00:13:51.500
I think you might have kicked
a video cable for a second.

00:13:51.500 --> 00:13:53.560
You're going to make all the
guys in the back go nuts.

00:13:53.560 --> 00:13:54.450
So careful there.

00:13:54.450 --> 00:13:56.560
Actually, I think it
did just disconnect.

00:13:56.560 --> 00:13:58.350
WM LELER: So the
question was somebody

00:13:58.350 --> 00:13:59.910
who was using
scoped_model, but they

00:13:59.910 --> 00:14:02.649
said it's maybe not the right
fit for their app right now.

00:14:02.649 --> 00:14:04.440
ANDREW BROGDON: And I
know state management

00:14:04.440 --> 00:14:05.930
is a mission of yours.

00:14:05.930 --> 00:14:07.030
FILIP HRACEK: Yes.

00:14:07.030 --> 00:14:07.720
ANDREW BROGDON:
So how do you get

00:14:07.720 --> 00:14:09.761
to scoped_model in the
first place, and then what

00:14:09.761 --> 00:14:11.417
might you go on to after that?

00:14:11.417 --> 00:14:12.250
FILIP HRACEK: Right.

00:14:12.250 --> 00:14:16.590
So yeah, a lot of people are
asking about state management

00:14:16.590 --> 00:14:19.390
all the time, and that's
a really good question.

00:14:19.390 --> 00:14:22.470
I don't there's one
answer to everyone.

00:14:22.470 --> 00:14:24.904
It always depends
on many things.

00:14:24.904 --> 00:14:25.820
It depends on the app.

00:14:25.820 --> 00:14:30.460
It depends on the team
and previous experience,

00:14:30.460 --> 00:14:31.230
and all that.

00:14:34.575 --> 00:14:37.680
I think scoped_model
is a really good start,

00:14:37.680 --> 00:14:40.650
and for many people,
it is what they need.

00:14:40.650 --> 00:14:44.640
Because I think it's pretty
simple to understand.

00:14:44.640 --> 00:14:47.700
It gives you all the
things that you want.

00:14:47.700 --> 00:14:51.330
It is a little less reactive
than maybe some people

00:14:51.330 --> 00:14:52.320
would want.

00:14:52.320 --> 00:14:56.010
So a lot of people
will use something

00:14:56.010 --> 00:14:58.590
like practice extensions.

00:14:58.590 --> 00:15:01.920
Maybe some people are
just super into redox.

00:15:01.920 --> 00:15:07.690
Then you have a flood
of redox package build.

00:15:07.690 --> 00:15:11.800
So I mean, it depends
on what you want,

00:15:11.800 --> 00:15:14.820
what your inputs, are
and stuff like that.

00:15:14.820 --> 00:15:16.510
It's not really better.

00:15:16.510 --> 00:15:17.050
ANDREW BROGDON:
I think it really

00:15:17.050 --> 00:15:19.450
just depends on what are the
patterns you've used before

00:15:19.450 --> 00:15:20.320
and enjoy.

00:15:20.320 --> 00:15:22.150
I think that is one of
the biggest factors.

00:15:22.150 --> 00:15:24.670
If you've used redox in the
past and really loved it,

00:15:24.670 --> 00:15:26.270
there's nothing
wrong with redox.

00:15:26.270 --> 00:15:29.160
It works great with Flutter.

00:15:29.160 --> 00:15:31.030
If you're used to
streams that block things

00:15:31.030 --> 00:15:33.822
like that are very good.

00:15:33.822 --> 00:15:34.780
FILIP HRACEK: Yes, yes.

00:15:34.780 --> 00:15:37.600
And also, I would be
really interested to know

00:15:37.600 --> 00:15:42.490
what are the limitations
that this person sees.

00:15:42.490 --> 00:15:46.840
Because obviously, there
are things that could--

00:15:46.840 --> 00:15:49.120
for example, scoped_model
doesn't really

00:15:49.120 --> 00:15:53.445
work that well with
streams, I guess.

00:15:53.445 --> 00:15:55.570
ANDREW BROGDON: It rebuilds
widgets in its own way,

00:15:55.570 --> 00:15:58.159
rather than providing
streams the way block would,

00:15:58.159 --> 00:15:59.200
or something else, right?

00:15:59.200 --> 00:16:00.880
FILIP HRACEK: So you
can still use it,

00:16:00.880 --> 00:16:04.840
but it kind of feels dirty to
be like listening to a stream

00:16:04.840 --> 00:16:07.520
and then notifying listeners.

00:16:07.520 --> 00:16:10.180
So anything is possible.

00:16:10.180 --> 00:16:10.690
Yeah.

00:16:10.690 --> 00:16:13.690
I guess I don't have a
single answer to that.

00:16:13.690 --> 00:16:15.010
ANDREW BROGDON: Which is fine.

00:16:15.010 --> 00:16:16.801
WM LELER: Do you think
that, in the future,

00:16:16.801 --> 00:16:19.000
there might be different
ways of managing state

00:16:19.000 --> 00:16:20.620
that we don't even know about?

00:16:20.620 --> 00:16:21.320
FILIP HRACEK: Oh yeah, sure.

00:16:21.320 --> 00:16:21.819
Sure.

00:16:21.819 --> 00:16:23.080
I was actually researching--

00:16:23.080 --> 00:16:24.940
I'm always researching.

00:16:24.940 --> 00:16:28.990
And last week, I found out that
there is a new thing that's

00:16:28.990 --> 00:16:30.140
pretty impressive.

00:16:30.140 --> 00:16:34.850
It's not completely baked yet,
but it's always something new.

00:16:34.850 --> 00:16:38.230
And I think Flutter
is very young

00:16:38.230 --> 00:16:46.600
so it will have a plethora of
different ways to manage state.

00:16:46.600 --> 00:16:50.650
And in the end, many people
will tell you state management

00:16:50.650 --> 00:16:54.270
is building your app.

00:16:54.270 --> 00:16:56.020
I [? assure ?] you
will build your layout,

00:16:56.020 --> 00:16:57.040
and stuff like this.

00:16:57.040 --> 00:17:02.940
But after that, it's how do I
manage the state of the app?

00:17:02.940 --> 00:17:07.450
And so you could go
all the way from just

00:17:07.450 --> 00:17:10.510
using state and stateful
widgets, which I don't

00:17:10.510 --> 00:17:12.339
recommend, but it can be--

00:17:12.339 --> 00:17:13.880
ANDREW BROGDON: You
can go a long way

00:17:13.880 --> 00:17:16.420
just with stateful widgets,
instead of rolling your own--

00:17:16.420 --> 00:17:19.089
that's not necessarily a bad
way to go for a lot of people

00:17:19.089 --> 00:17:21.439
coming, onboarding
themselves with Flutter.

00:17:21.439 --> 00:17:22.480
FILIP HRACEK: Yeah, yeah.

00:17:22.480 --> 00:17:26.050
I think what we are not
doing a really good job at

00:17:26.050 --> 00:17:29.290
is that many people
will just start Flutter.

00:17:29.290 --> 00:17:32.560
They will see the
clicking gab where you're

00:17:32.560 --> 00:17:34.030
incrementing the counter.

00:17:34.030 --> 00:17:38.680
And they think, oh, this is
the way you manage state.

00:17:38.680 --> 00:17:41.590
And that's true for
a single widget,

00:17:41.590 --> 00:17:44.770
but it's often not
true for the app.

00:17:44.770 --> 00:17:47.920
And we're not really
doing much to tell people,

00:17:47.920 --> 00:17:50.980
yeah, maybe at least do
something with scoped_model.

00:17:50.980 --> 00:17:53.230
WM LELER: Yeah, and I was
actually talking to somebody

00:17:53.230 --> 00:17:58.300
earlier and they made a point,
and I think I agree with them,

00:17:58.300 --> 00:18:00.080
but I wanted your opinion on it.

00:18:00.080 --> 00:18:03.010
They said that Flutter
sort of takes things

00:18:03.010 --> 00:18:06.460
far enough that we can actually
invent new types of state

00:18:06.460 --> 00:18:11.290
management that are specific
to Flutter and to Dart because

00:18:11.290 --> 00:18:14.352
of the characteristics
of Dart being functional

00:18:14.352 --> 00:18:16.060
and having streams,
and things like that.

00:18:19.070 --> 00:18:21.040
FILIP HRACEK: I was
recently, last week,

00:18:21.040 --> 00:18:25.210
talking to a person
who came from Android.

00:18:25.210 --> 00:18:28.240
And for many people like that--

00:18:28.240 --> 00:18:33.940
for me, when I came to Flutter
first to reactive programming,

00:18:33.940 --> 00:18:37.600
it is kind of a
change of mindset.

00:18:37.600 --> 00:18:45.770
And so again, we probably should
be more better at explaining.

00:18:45.770 --> 00:18:49.030
OK, so for example
it's not a big deal

00:18:49.030 --> 00:18:52.810
if you rebuild the whole
app once in a while.

00:18:52.810 --> 00:18:56.140
For an Android
person, for example,

00:18:56.140 --> 00:18:58.540
like me many years ago--

00:18:58.540 --> 00:19:01.470
ANDREW BROGDON: [INAUDIBLE].

00:19:01.470 --> 00:19:04.540
FILIP HRACEK: They
would be like, I

00:19:04.540 --> 00:19:08.600
hope that you're not recreating
the whole UI from scratch.

00:19:08.600 --> 00:19:10.540
But in Flutter, sure, why not?

00:19:10.540 --> 00:19:13.240
That's what you do all the time.

00:19:13.240 --> 00:19:15.080
ANDREW BROGDON: So we
need to let you go,

00:19:15.080 --> 00:19:17.350
but we did have one question
that came up, I think, from--

00:19:17.350 --> 00:19:18.500
WM LELER: Oh yes, an
important question.

00:19:18.500 --> 00:19:19.470
I almost forgot.

00:19:19.470 --> 00:19:20.800
ANDREW BROGDON: Different
people, they have requested.

00:19:20.800 --> 00:19:21.840
They want you to
know that they'd

00:19:21.840 --> 00:19:23.830
love to see the source
for your timeline app,

00:19:23.830 --> 00:19:25.630
if it's at all possible.

00:19:25.630 --> 00:19:27.880
FILIP HRACEK: I have to
say it's not just mine,

00:19:27.880 --> 00:19:30.170
it's also 2Dimensions'.

00:19:30.170 --> 00:19:33.730
And we are going to release
it, but right now it's

00:19:33.730 --> 00:19:35.590
a little bit ugly.

00:19:35.590 --> 00:19:38.530
So we want to make it
a little nicer first.

00:19:38.530 --> 00:19:42.899
It was that last minute
brunch that kind of killed--

00:19:42.899 --> 00:19:45.315
WM LELER: So what you're telling
us, it will be available,

00:19:45.315 --> 00:19:46.640
you're just not telling us when.

00:19:46.640 --> 00:19:47.090
FILIP HRACEK: Oh yeah.

00:19:47.090 --> 00:19:47.910
WM LELER: But hopefully soon.

00:19:47.910 --> 00:19:48.951
FILIP HRACEK: Yeah, yeah.

00:19:48.951 --> 00:19:49.701
Always.

00:19:49.701 --> 00:19:50.200
OK.

00:19:50.200 --> 00:19:50.770
ANDREW BROGDON: Well,
thank you so much.

00:19:50.770 --> 00:19:51.895
Please take the microphone.

00:19:51.895 --> 00:19:52.870
Thanks for coming up.

00:19:55.630 --> 00:19:56.810
WM LELER: Wow.

00:19:56.810 --> 00:19:58.970
Do you have any
Livestream questions?

00:19:58.970 --> 00:20:03.906
ANDREW BROGDON: Yeah, let's
take a look at the Livestream.

00:20:03.906 --> 00:20:05.780
People recommending
their favorite approaches

00:20:05.780 --> 00:20:07.090
to state management.

00:20:07.090 --> 00:20:09.470
WM LELER: Yeah?

00:20:09.470 --> 00:20:10.220
Well, that's good.

00:20:10.220 --> 00:20:12.500
We'll have people arguing
for different forms of state

00:20:12.500 --> 00:20:13.180
management.

00:20:13.180 --> 00:20:13.985
It'll be good.

00:20:13.985 --> 00:20:15.110
ANDREW BROGDON: Here's one.

00:20:15.110 --> 00:20:17.193
How does Flutter compare
to React Native, which is

00:20:17.193 --> 00:20:18.500
something we've heard before.

00:20:18.500 --> 00:20:21.080
WM LELER: This is an
excellent question.

00:20:21.080 --> 00:20:26.930
So it is important to
compare different products.

00:20:26.930 --> 00:20:29.450
But what I worry about
is that sometimes it

00:20:29.450 --> 00:20:32.770
turns into sort of an
argument about what's better,

00:20:32.770 --> 00:20:35.000
and I don't think
that helps anybody.

00:20:35.000 --> 00:20:38.330
Me, personally, I think
React Native was actually

00:20:38.330 --> 00:20:39.960
a brilliant thing
for them to do.

00:20:39.960 --> 00:20:44.050
They took something that
was made for the web, React,

00:20:44.050 --> 00:20:48.050
and they said, hey, we
could take that technology

00:20:48.050 --> 00:20:49.460
and apply it to native apps.

00:20:49.460 --> 00:20:51.260
And that's a brilliant thing.

00:20:51.260 --> 00:20:54.740
Flutter is similar in some ways
in that we're also reactive,

00:20:54.740 --> 00:20:57.650
but it's also solving a
slightly different problem.

00:20:57.650 --> 00:21:02.447
And I don't expect
React Native to go away.

00:21:02.447 --> 00:21:05.030
I wouldn't tell people, oh, if
you're using React Native, just

00:21:05.030 --> 00:21:06.220
use Flutter.

00:21:06.220 --> 00:21:09.260
They're for different things,
and that's a good thing.

00:21:09.260 --> 00:21:11.270
And you were talking
about something

00:21:11.270 --> 00:21:12.585
like that the other day.

00:21:12.585 --> 00:21:13.460
ANDREW BROGDON: Yeah.

00:21:13.460 --> 00:21:17.390
I mean, this question
comes up a lot.

00:21:17.390 --> 00:21:19.610
Obviously, we believe
in Flutter, the SDK,

00:21:19.610 --> 00:21:22.970
and what it can do, and that
it can play an important role

00:21:22.970 --> 00:21:25.160
in software and helping people.

00:21:25.160 --> 00:21:28.100
But it's still just one more
tool in everybody's tool belt,

00:21:28.100 --> 00:21:28.610
right?

00:21:28.610 --> 00:21:29.984
The fact that
Flutter exists does

00:21:29.984 --> 00:21:32.690
it mean that React Native
isn't a good way to make apps.

00:21:32.690 --> 00:21:35.657
Obviously, for many,
many developers, it is.

00:21:35.657 --> 00:21:38.240
And the same is true of native
development on iOS and Android.

00:21:38.240 --> 00:21:40.940
Those things didn't stop
being good ways to build apps,

00:21:40.940 --> 00:21:44.190
it's just that Flutter
is another way to do it.

00:21:44.190 --> 00:21:46.970
And we think it's
a really good one.

00:21:46.970 --> 00:21:47.810
That's about it.

00:21:47.810 --> 00:21:51.140
It's two positives
rather than a--

00:21:51.140 --> 00:21:53.540
WM LELER: So I've noticed
some other people standing by.

00:21:53.540 --> 00:21:55.310
ANDREW BROGDON:
Who's in the corner?

00:21:55.310 --> 00:21:57.350
WM LELER: We've got
several questions that

00:21:57.350 --> 00:22:00.110
came from people
that, to me, are more

00:22:00.110 --> 00:22:01.910
questions about the community.

00:22:01.910 --> 00:22:04.880
So for example, one person
asked, when are there

00:22:04.880 --> 00:22:07.940
going to be a way to
play sounds in Flutter,

00:22:07.940 --> 00:22:08.995
and stuff like that.

00:22:08.995 --> 00:22:11.370
ANDREW BROGDON: There is a
way to play sounds in Flutter.

00:22:11.370 --> 00:22:12.020
WM LELER: Yeah.

00:22:12.020 --> 00:22:15.380
There are plugins in the pub
directory for playing sounds,

00:22:15.380 --> 00:22:16.280
and stuff like that.

00:22:16.280 --> 00:22:19.500
And as far as I know, they were
all written by third parties.

00:22:19.500 --> 00:22:20.060
[INAUDIBLE]

00:22:20.060 --> 00:22:21.976
ANDREW BROGDON: Yeah,
open-source development.

00:22:21.976 --> 00:22:24.410
And we have one right here.

00:22:24.410 --> 00:22:25.040
I can see him.

00:22:25.040 --> 00:22:27.650
Come on, Simon.

00:22:27.650 --> 00:22:30.280
So some of you
may know this man.

00:22:30.280 --> 00:22:33.634
As our next guest, this is
Simon Lightfoot, a London local.

00:22:33.634 --> 00:22:34.550
WM LELER: How are you?

00:22:34.550 --> 00:22:36.091
SIMON LIGHTFOOT:
I'm good, thank you.

00:22:36.091 --> 00:22:37.876
WM LELER: Welcome to London.

00:22:37.876 --> 00:22:39.250
SIMON LIGHTFOOT:
Yeah, thank you.

00:22:39.250 --> 00:22:42.241
WM LELER: Anyway, we were just
talking about the community.

00:22:42.241 --> 00:22:44.240
Can you talk a little bit
about your involvement

00:22:44.240 --> 00:22:45.450
with the community?

00:22:45.450 --> 00:22:47.390
SIMON LIGHTFOOT: I
mean, we've done a lot

00:22:47.390 --> 00:22:52.670
to build the online
conversation that Flutter

00:22:52.670 --> 00:22:54.272
invoked in everyone, I think.

00:22:54.272 --> 00:22:55.362
WM LELER: Right.

00:22:55.362 --> 00:22:57.320
SIMON LIGHTFOOT: We've
started the study group.

00:22:57.320 --> 00:22:59.154
We've now got the Flutter
community, Medium.

00:22:59.154 --> 00:23:00.111
WM LELER: That's right.

00:23:00.111 --> 00:23:01.700
SIMON LIGHTFOOT:
And I mean, everyone

00:23:01.700 --> 00:23:04.270
is welcome to publish articles.

00:23:04.270 --> 00:23:06.680
We invite everyone
to submit articles

00:23:06.680 --> 00:23:08.120
and we'll review
them, edit them,

00:23:08.120 --> 00:23:11.120
and make sure they're sent out
on the schedule, which really

00:23:11.120 --> 00:23:14.150
helps to make sure that
everyone's getting information

00:23:14.150 --> 00:23:15.670
about Flutter that
everyone really

00:23:15.670 --> 00:23:18.299
needs to get going immediately.

00:23:18.299 --> 00:23:20.090
ANDREW BROGDON: How do
we let the community

00:23:20.090 --> 00:23:23.840
know that they shouldn't
ask us when is Google

00:23:23.840 --> 00:23:25.790
going to build this or that.

00:23:25.790 --> 00:23:27.920
This is going to succeed
if we all work together

00:23:27.920 --> 00:23:28.790
on things like that.

00:23:28.790 --> 00:23:30.290
SIMON LIGHTFOOT: I
mean, this is it.

00:23:30.290 --> 00:23:32.060
I mean, what we've seen--

00:23:32.060 --> 00:23:35.280
what we've actually started up
is the Flutter community GitHub

00:23:35.280 --> 00:23:36.930
organization.

00:23:36.930 --> 00:23:39.410
And what we've done is
any of these projects

00:23:39.410 --> 00:23:43.350
that the committee
have built that want

00:23:43.350 --> 00:23:45.670
to get owned by the community.

00:23:45.670 --> 00:23:49.340
So how is that scenario
of a developer [INAUDIBLE]

00:23:49.340 --> 00:23:51.810
maintain their
open-source project.

00:23:51.810 --> 00:23:53.510
They start up as
an idea saying, we

00:23:53.510 --> 00:23:54.830
want this on our Flutter app.

00:23:54.830 --> 00:23:56.510
I made this one app.

00:23:56.510 --> 00:23:58.280
Now it's out there.

00:23:58.280 --> 00:23:59.850
Who's going to
maintain this product?

00:23:59.850 --> 00:24:02.460
People submit PRs,
people submit fixes.

00:24:02.460 --> 00:24:03.830
No one's merging them.

00:24:03.830 --> 00:24:05.272
So we're here to help.

00:24:05.272 --> 00:24:06.230
WM LELER: That's great.

00:24:06.230 --> 00:24:09.152
That's an awesome thing to do.

00:24:09.152 --> 00:24:11.360
ANDREW BROGDON: I see another
community-- do you mind

00:24:11.360 --> 00:24:13.360
if I swap you out for Hillel.

00:24:13.360 --> 00:24:14.740
OK, why don't you
pass the baton.

00:24:14.740 --> 00:24:16.642
SIMON LIGHTFOOT: I'll
see you guys later.

00:24:16.642 --> 00:24:18.350
ANDREW BROGDON: Thank
you so much, Simon.

00:24:18.350 --> 00:24:20.141
WM LELER: We have
another community member.

00:24:20.141 --> 00:24:22.502
ANDREW BROGDON: Yes.

00:24:22.502 --> 00:24:23.790
WM LELER: This is Hillel.

00:24:23.790 --> 00:24:24.450
Welcome.

00:24:24.450 --> 00:24:25.120
HILLEL COREN: Thank you.

00:24:25.120 --> 00:24:25.600
Nice to be here.

00:24:25.600 --> 00:24:26.360
What's happening?

00:24:26.360 --> 00:24:27.630
ANDREW BROGDON: So
internet, Hillel.

00:24:27.630 --> 00:24:28.390
Hillel, internet.

00:24:28.390 --> 00:24:29.880
You've probably met before.

00:24:29.880 --> 00:24:31.624
HILLEL COREN: Nice
to see you here.

00:24:31.624 --> 00:24:33.040
ANDREW BROGDON:
So when I saw you,

00:24:33.040 --> 00:24:37.060
I was happy because you were the
guy behind itsallwidgets.com,

00:24:37.060 --> 00:24:37.984
which is great.

00:24:37.984 --> 00:24:39.650
Can you tell us a
little bit about that?

00:24:39.650 --> 00:24:40.441
HILLEL COREN: Sure.

00:24:40.441 --> 00:24:44.651
It's All Widgets is a open
site for listing Flutter apps.

00:24:44.651 --> 00:24:46.150
Any developer,
anywhere in the world

00:24:46.150 --> 00:24:47.230
is free to publish their app.

00:24:47.230 --> 00:24:48.460
Doesn't need to be
in the app store.

00:24:48.460 --> 00:24:49.775
Doesn't need to be open source.

00:24:49.775 --> 00:24:52.300
If you're proud of something you
built and want to showcase it,

00:24:52.300 --> 00:24:53.360
you can submit the site.

00:24:53.360 --> 00:24:54.947
We're happy to show it.

00:24:54.947 --> 00:24:56.530
ANDREW BROGDON: So
we all need a place

00:24:56.530 --> 00:24:58.529
to do that occasionally,
to crow about something

00:24:58.529 --> 00:25:01.290
that we've built. How
many apps do you have?

00:25:01.290 --> 00:25:03.117
HILLEL COREN: So far,
we have about 200.

00:25:03.117 --> 00:25:04.450
I mean, that's just in the site.

00:25:04.450 --> 00:25:06.950
Obviously, in Flutter, there
are thousands of apps unlisted.

00:25:06.950 --> 00:25:08.616
To me, more interesting
than the number,

00:25:08.616 --> 00:25:10.150
is the rate of
growth, where it took

00:25:10.150 --> 00:25:11.530
a few months to get to 100.

00:25:11.530 --> 00:25:13.540
From 100 to 200, it took
about half that time.

00:25:13.540 --> 00:25:14.110
ANDREW BROGDON: Oh, wow.

00:25:14.110 --> 00:25:16.235
HILLEL COREN: We're seeing
this exponential growth.

00:25:16.235 --> 00:25:18.340
WM LELER: So your
half-life is going down.

00:25:18.340 --> 00:25:19.900
ANDREW BROGDON: What are some
of the most interesting ones you

00:25:19.900 --> 00:25:20.260
have?

00:25:20.260 --> 00:25:21.460
I mean, you have 200 apps.

00:25:21.460 --> 00:25:22.626
HILLEL COREN: Good question.

00:25:22.626 --> 00:25:24.970
So what I find interesting
is when an app is submitted,

00:25:24.970 --> 00:25:26.950
it gets shared with
a group of followers.

00:25:26.950 --> 00:25:28.000
And every once in
a while, someone

00:25:28.000 --> 00:25:29.970
will message me and say, this
app, it can't be Flutter.

00:25:29.970 --> 00:25:31.303
Doesn't look like a Flutter app.

00:25:31.303 --> 00:25:33.150
And I get nervous,
and I go scrambling,

00:25:33.150 --> 00:25:34.526
and I message a developer.

00:25:34.526 --> 00:25:36.650
Every time, it turns out,
yeah, it's a Flutter app.

00:25:36.650 --> 00:25:38.490
And the thing I think
I've taken from this,

00:25:38.490 --> 00:25:39.845
there's no look of Flutter app.

00:25:39.845 --> 00:25:41.303
Flutter app can
look like anything.

00:25:41.303 --> 00:25:43.960
You're just limited by your
imagination and [INAUDIBLE]

00:25:43.960 --> 00:25:46.730
listing of apps, because they're
all completely different.

00:25:46.730 --> 00:25:47.800
ANDREW BROGDON: Awesome.

00:25:47.800 --> 00:25:49.508
WM LELER: I think we
need a new campaign.

00:25:49.508 --> 00:25:51.060
What does a Flutter
app look like?

00:25:51.060 --> 00:25:52.646
Anything you want.

00:25:52.646 --> 00:25:55.926
HILLEL COREN:
Absolutely, absolutely.

00:25:55.926 --> 00:25:57.550
ANDREW BROGDON: You
also did a podcast,

00:25:57.550 --> 00:25:59.480
or started a podcast
series recently, right?

00:25:59.480 --> 00:25:59.830
HILLEL COREN: That's right.

00:25:59.830 --> 00:26:00.413
It's a widget.

00:26:00.413 --> 00:26:02.095
Initially, it was
going to be a podcast.

00:26:02.095 --> 00:26:03.110
Thomas [INAUDIBLE].

00:26:03.110 --> 00:26:04.540
ANDREW BROGDON: It
morphed into a website.

00:26:04.540 --> 00:26:05.450
HILLEL COREN: Pretty much.

00:26:05.450 --> 00:26:07.570
At the time, Simon Lightfoot
and Scott [INAUDIBLE]

00:26:07.570 --> 00:26:09.860
were also working on
their own podcast.

00:26:09.860 --> 00:26:12.359
We teamed up, pivoted
to this website.

00:26:12.359 --> 00:26:13.900
Now that the site's
kind of finished,

00:26:13.900 --> 00:26:16.050
we've had time to go
back to the podcast idea.

00:26:16.050 --> 00:26:18.300
So we just started working
on it these past two weeks.

00:26:18.300 --> 00:26:19.350
It's been a great response.

00:26:19.350 --> 00:26:21.141
ANDREW BROGDON: Who
have you had on so far?

00:26:21.141 --> 00:26:22.810
HILLEL COREN: Some
amazing developers.

00:26:22.810 --> 00:26:27.192
Marco, Rohan, Omar, GroovinChip.

00:26:27.192 --> 00:26:28.650
And if you go to
itsallwidgets.com,

00:26:28.650 --> 00:26:29.740
you can see the list.

00:26:29.740 --> 00:26:31.540
If you click Podcast
on the top right.

00:26:31.540 --> 00:26:33.860
Anyone watching, you're
welcome to be on the podcast.

00:26:33.860 --> 00:26:35.050
Just go to the site.

00:26:35.050 --> 00:26:36.990
Anyone can send a request
to be interviewed.

00:26:36.990 --> 00:26:39.052
And the idea is, the goal
is, just for developers

00:26:39.052 --> 00:26:40.510
to share their
Flutter experiences,

00:26:40.510 --> 00:26:44.080
to be able to say what
their backgrounds are,

00:26:44.080 --> 00:26:46.880
what they're learning, and also
share best practices and tips

00:26:46.880 --> 00:26:47.790
and tricks.

00:26:47.790 --> 00:26:48.670
ANDREW BROGDON: Cool.

00:26:48.670 --> 00:26:51.200
So actually, we've reached
the end of our second block.

00:26:51.200 --> 00:26:53.930
So I'm going to ask
you to stay right here.

00:26:53.930 --> 00:26:56.380
And one of the things I wanted
to make sure to mention,

00:26:56.380 --> 00:26:58.990
the thing that I love
about itsallwidgets.com

00:26:58.990 --> 00:27:01.600
is that you can filter based on
whether the app is open source

00:27:01.600 --> 00:27:02.350
or not.

00:27:02.350 --> 00:27:02.830
HILLEL COREN: Right.

00:27:02.830 --> 00:27:04.290
ANDREW BROGDON: And then when
you go in to look at the app,

00:27:04.290 --> 00:27:05.956
it will have a link
to the source, which

00:27:05.956 --> 00:27:07.610
is the greatest thing ever.

00:27:07.610 --> 00:27:08.560
So go look at.

00:27:08.560 --> 00:27:09.610
It's itsallwidgets.com.

00:27:09.610 --> 00:27:10.210
Look through the apps.

00:27:10.210 --> 00:27:11.350
When you see
something like, oh, I

00:27:11.350 --> 00:27:13.960
would love to know how they
did that, you can go see how

00:27:13.960 --> 00:27:15.460
they did that and it's great.

00:27:15.460 --> 00:27:16.580
HILLEL COREN: Actually,
I had one thing.

00:27:16.580 --> 00:27:16.870
ANDREW BROGDON: Sure.

00:27:16.870 --> 00:27:18.340
HILLEL COREN: I just want to say
that these projects, obviously,

00:27:18.340 --> 00:27:19.349
take time and resources.

00:27:19.349 --> 00:27:21.640
I'm incredibly lucky to work
with two amazing partners,

00:27:21.640 --> 00:27:23.590
[INAUDIBLE] and Dave,
who I love very much.

00:27:23.590 --> 00:27:25.570
I'm blessed to
work with you guys.

00:27:25.570 --> 00:27:26.964
We work at
[INAUDIBLE] and collab

00:27:26.964 --> 00:27:28.630
at the time to work
with these projects.

00:27:28.630 --> 00:27:30.720
We're still doing a lot of
Flutter work, these side

00:27:30.720 --> 00:27:32.260
projects, but I think we're
going to help the community,

00:27:32.260 --> 00:27:33.730
help myself learn more.

00:27:33.730 --> 00:27:35.147
It's just been a
great experience.

00:27:35.147 --> 00:27:36.230
ANDREW BROGDON: Excellent.

00:27:36.230 --> 00:27:37.000
It's a lot of fun.

00:27:37.000 --> 00:27:40.950
