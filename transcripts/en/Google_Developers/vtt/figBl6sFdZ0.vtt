JAREK WILKIEWICZ:
Hello, everyone.

00:00:10.120 --> 00:00:11.740
My name is Jarek Wilkiewicz.

00:00:11.740 --> 00:00:13.980
Welcome to YouTube
Developers Live.

00:00:13.980 --> 00:00:15.640
We have an exciting show
for you today.

00:00:15.640 --> 00:00:17.860
In the studio, we have
Shawn Simister.

00:00:17.860 --> 00:00:18.340
How are you, Shawn?

00:00:18.340 --> 00:00:18.760
SHAWN SIMISTER: Hi.

00:00:18.760 --> 00:00:20.020
I'm great.

00:00:20.020 --> 00:00:22.250
JAREK WILKIEWICZ: Shawn works on
Freebase and Freebase API.

00:00:22.250 --> 00:00:25.250
We will tell you more about what
Freebase has to do with

00:00:25.250 --> 00:00:29.340
YouTube Knowledge Graph,
semantic search, a lot of

00:00:29.340 --> 00:00:31.150
interesting new concepts.

00:00:31.150 --> 00:00:32.900
And then we also have
Greg Schechter.

00:00:32.900 --> 00:00:33.650
How are you doing, Greg?

00:00:33.650 --> 00:00:34.300
GREG SCHECHTER: I'm
doing very well.

00:00:34.300 --> 00:00:35.250
How are you?

00:00:35.250 --> 00:00:36.130
JAREK WILKIEWICZ: Good.

00:00:36.130 --> 00:00:36.730
Long time, no see.

00:00:36.730 --> 00:00:37.700
GREG SCHECHTER: Ah, yeah.

00:00:37.700 --> 00:00:39.570
JAREK WILKIEWICZ: So first of
all, I would like to welcome

00:00:39.570 --> 00:00:42.360
Greg to our team.

00:00:42.360 --> 00:00:45.610
Greg has recently switched from
full-time engineering on

00:00:45.610 --> 00:00:49.700
YouTube to full-time Developer
Relations.

00:00:49.700 --> 00:00:50.730
GREG SCHECHTER: I'm pretty
excited for it.

00:00:50.730 --> 00:00:52.240
JAREK WILKIEWICZ: If you guys
had watched the previous

00:00:52.240 --> 00:00:54.680
appearance by Greg about HTML5,
I think he liked it a

00:00:54.680 --> 00:00:56.610
little bit too much.

00:00:56.610 --> 00:00:59.380
He decided to make this
a full-time job.

00:00:59.380 --> 00:01:00.330
Welcome.

00:01:00.330 --> 00:01:02.700
How has your first couple of
weeks been going so far?

00:01:02.700 --> 00:01:04.030
GREG SCHECHTER: They've
been very busy.

00:01:04.030 --> 00:01:06.440
There's a lot to learn
and a lot to do.

00:01:06.440 --> 00:01:07.880
JAREK WILKIEWICZ: Yeah?

00:01:07.880 --> 00:01:08.620
Is it an adjustment?

00:01:08.620 --> 00:01:10.910
Do you feel like it is very
different from what you're

00:01:10.910 --> 00:01:11.590
doing before?

00:01:11.590 --> 00:01:12.710
Is it--

00:01:12.710 --> 00:01:14.065
GREG SCHECHTER: I think it's
a good transition.

00:01:16.930 --> 00:01:19.650
I'm focusing a lot more on
reaching out to the developer

00:01:19.650 --> 00:01:22.100
community, and that's a lot
of fun, so it's good.

00:01:22.100 --> 00:01:24.880
JAREK WILKIEWICZ: Well, very
happy to have you, and welcome

00:01:24.880 --> 00:01:25.840
to the team.

00:01:25.840 --> 00:01:28.960
So let's talk a little
bit about you, Shawn.

00:01:28.960 --> 00:01:30.390
You've been at Google
for how long?

00:01:30.390 --> 00:01:31.920
SHAWN SIMISTER: I've been
at Google now for

00:01:31.920 --> 00:01:32.730
a year and a half.

00:01:32.730 --> 00:01:35.850
JAREK WILKIEWICZ: OK, and you
have been involved in the

00:01:35.850 --> 00:01:38.030
Freebase community for much
longer than that, right?

00:01:38.030 --> 00:01:39.850
SHAWN SIMISTER: Yeah,
for five years now.

00:01:39.850 --> 00:01:42.550
I was a member of the Freebase
community for three years

00:01:42.550 --> 00:01:47.340
before coming here, so a lot of
experience in the Freebase

00:01:47.340 --> 00:01:47.910
community before I came.

00:01:47.910 --> 00:01:49.170
JAREK WILKIEWICZ: So what
got you into Freebase?

00:01:52.040 --> 00:01:53.770
SHAWN SIMISTER: I was very
interested in Wikipedia, and

00:01:53.770 --> 00:01:57.290
in open data, and in a lot
of those different areas.

00:01:57.290 --> 00:02:00.130
And when Freebase came out, it
was the first one that had a

00:02:00.130 --> 00:02:02.410
really easy-to-use API for
accessing that sort of

00:02:02.410 --> 00:02:03.730
structured data.

00:02:03.730 --> 00:02:05.600
So that was something that
I really appreciated.

00:02:05.600 --> 00:02:08.150
JAREK WILKIEWICZ: So maybe
we should talk about what

00:02:08.150 --> 00:02:09.229
Freebase is.

00:02:09.229 --> 00:02:09.690
What is it?

00:02:09.690 --> 00:02:10.710
SHAWN SIMISTER: Yeah,
absolutely.

00:02:10.710 --> 00:02:13.320
So Freebase is an open
Knowledge Graph with

00:02:13.320 --> 00:02:16.460
information of over 23
million entities.

00:02:16.460 --> 00:02:18.520
So these are real-world
entities--

00:02:18.520 --> 00:02:20.510
people places, things.

00:02:20.510 --> 00:02:22.880
And like I said, there's an API
for that, so developers

00:02:22.880 --> 00:02:24.410
can tap into that
knowledge base.

00:02:24.410 --> 00:02:27.330
JAREK WILKIEWICZ: So are
entities represented, or are

00:02:27.330 --> 00:02:29.620
the relationships represented
as well

00:02:29.620 --> 00:02:31.670
between these entities?

00:02:31.670 --> 00:02:34.190
SHAWN SIMISTER: Yeah, so it's
not just the entities, but

00:02:34.190 --> 00:02:36.400
also the relationships
between them.

00:02:36.400 --> 00:02:39.170
So we have information about
people, but we also have

00:02:39.170 --> 00:02:41.330
information about the
relationships between those

00:02:41.330 --> 00:02:44.280
people, whether they're married
or whether they work

00:02:44.280 --> 00:02:45.740
together, that sort of thing.

00:02:45.740 --> 00:02:48.770
JAREK WILKIEWICZ: So not only
the hierarchy of the objects

00:02:48.770 --> 00:02:50.690
that are in the database,
but also how

00:02:50.690 --> 00:02:51.580
they are linked together.

00:02:51.580 --> 00:02:52.260
SHAWN SIMISTER: Exactly.

00:02:52.260 --> 00:02:54.820
JAREK WILKIEWICZ: So that kind
of reminds me of that

00:02:54.820 --> 00:02:58.260
Knowledge Graph, something
that I

00:02:58.260 --> 00:02:59.580
have heard about recently.

00:02:59.580 --> 00:03:02.420
Is there a relationship between
the Knowledge Graph

00:03:02.420 --> 00:03:03.950
and Freebase?

00:03:03.950 --> 00:03:04.580
SHAWN SIMISTER: So absolutely.

00:03:04.580 --> 00:03:08.190
So Freebase is one of the
sources that Google uses to

00:03:08.190 --> 00:03:09.810
build its Knowledge Graph.

00:03:09.810 --> 00:03:12.100
And I think we have a video here
to explain a little bit

00:03:12.100 --> 00:03:13.720
more about the Knowledge
Graph.

00:03:13.720 --> 00:03:16.830
JAREK WILKIEWICZ: OK, let's
take a look at the video.

00:03:16.830 --> 00:03:17.200
[VIDEO PLAYBACK]

00:03:17.200 --> 00:03:19.405
-Wouldn't it be amazing if
Google could understand that

00:03:19.405 --> 00:03:21.915
the words that you use when
you're doing a search, well,

00:03:21.915 --> 00:03:23.150
they aren't just words.

00:03:23.150 --> 00:03:25.590
They refer to real things
in the world.

00:03:25.590 --> 00:03:29.600
That a building is a building,
and an animal is an animal,

00:03:29.600 --> 00:03:32.560
and that they're not just random
strings of characters.

00:03:32.560 --> 00:03:36.170
If we can understand that those
words are talking about

00:03:36.170 --> 00:03:38.920
those real-world things, then
we can do a better job of

00:03:38.920 --> 00:03:41.515
getting you just the content
that you want off the web.

00:03:45.280 --> 00:03:47.920
-The way Google is trying to
build information about

00:03:47.920 --> 00:03:50.460
real-world connections is by
building a Knowledge Graph.

00:03:50.460 --> 00:03:54.120
The Knowledge Graph is about
collecting information about

00:03:54.120 --> 00:03:55.710
objects in the real world.

00:03:55.710 --> 00:03:59.170
The object could be a person,
could be a book, could be a

00:03:59.170 --> 00:04:01.450
movie, and many other
types of things.

00:04:01.450 --> 00:04:04.600
For example, for a famous
person, we collect relevant

00:04:04.600 --> 00:04:07.480
data about them, such as
their date of birth or

00:04:07.480 --> 00:04:09.160
how tall they are.

00:04:09.160 --> 00:04:12.220
We can also connect that person
to closely-related

00:04:12.220 --> 00:04:14.840
objects in the Knowledge
Graph.

00:04:14.840 --> 00:04:18.735
-Let's say you're interested
in Renaissance painters, or

00:04:18.735 --> 00:04:22.070
how about how many women have
won the Nobel Prize.

00:04:22.070 --> 00:04:24.570
By understanding the
relationships between things,

00:04:24.570 --> 00:04:27.780
be it between painters in the
Renaissance or women and the

00:04:27.780 --> 00:04:31.050
Nobel Prize, Google can do a
better job of understanding

00:04:31.050 --> 00:04:33.920
what it is exactly you're
searching for.

00:04:33.920 --> 00:04:36.610
-One of the first features we
are going to introduce, which

00:04:36.610 --> 00:04:39.710
applies the Knowledge
Graph, is a panel

00:04:39.710 --> 00:04:41.770
next to the web results.

00:04:41.770 --> 00:04:44.060
-When you have a question to
answer, others may have come

00:04:44.060 --> 00:04:46.830
to Google already to search
for the same thing.

00:04:46.830 --> 00:04:49.290
Google can jump-start your
research process by combining

00:04:49.290 --> 00:04:51.570
the information that others
found useful with the

00:04:51.570 --> 00:04:53.300
information in the
Knowledge Graph.

00:04:53.300 --> 00:04:56.450
-All of the collective human
wisdom that comes through our

00:04:56.450 --> 00:04:59.720
search engine, what people are
searching for, tells us what

00:04:59.720 --> 00:05:02.310
are the interesting things
to put in our database.

00:05:02.310 --> 00:05:03.890
-Take Leonardo da Vinci.

00:05:03.890 --> 00:05:06.720
Let's say you wanted to learn
about the most important

00:05:06.720 --> 00:05:08.370
Renaissance painters.

00:05:08.370 --> 00:05:11.460
You might search for Leonardo
da Vinci because he is the

00:05:11.460 --> 00:05:14.050
only Renaissance painter
you know about.

00:05:14.050 --> 00:05:17.040
Now you'll see information right
in the search results

00:05:17.040 --> 00:05:19.060
that helps you explore
the broader topic

00:05:19.060 --> 00:05:20.460
of Renaissance painters.

00:05:20.460 --> 00:05:22.730
You'll see some of the most
famous paintings from that

00:05:22.730 --> 00:05:25.970
era, like "The Mona Lisa," and
discover other painters of

00:05:25.970 --> 00:05:29.810
that time, like Michelangelo
and Raphael.

00:05:29.810 --> 00:05:32.320
-We're in the early phases
of moving from being an

00:05:32.320 --> 00:05:36.080
information engine to becoming
a knowledge engine, and these

00:05:36.080 --> 00:05:38.620
enhancements are one step
in that direction.

00:05:38.620 --> 00:05:41.290
-As we grow the Knowledge Graph
and make it larger and

00:05:41.290 --> 00:05:45.400
richer, we're really excited
about the opportunity we have

00:05:45.400 --> 00:05:48.340
to understand more of the users'
queries, to understand

00:05:48.340 --> 00:05:51.600
more about the information
that's out there on the web,

00:05:51.600 --> 00:05:53.790
and intelligently connect
the two to each other.

00:06:00.706 --> 00:06:01.210
[END VIDEO PLAYBACK]

00:06:01.210 --> 00:06:01.600
JAREK WILKIEWICZ: Great.

00:06:01.600 --> 00:06:07.700
So it looks like Search already
uses that information.

00:06:07.700 --> 00:06:12.470
And thinking about Freebase, I
was actually an artificial

00:06:12.470 --> 00:06:16.970
intelligence major in college,
and I remember learning about

00:06:16.970 --> 00:06:22.360
the project to replicate common
sense called Cyc.

00:06:22.360 --> 00:06:25.050
So is that the goal
of Freebase?

00:06:25.050 --> 00:06:29.520
What was the actual original
goal, and where is it going?

00:06:29.520 --> 00:06:32.870
SHAWN SIMISTER: So Freebase
and Cyc are both knowledge

00:06:32.870 --> 00:06:35.380
bases about real-world things.

00:06:35.380 --> 00:06:37.970
They have a couple differences,
though.

00:06:37.970 --> 00:06:41.770
Freebase is aiming to make it
easy for developers to access

00:06:41.770 --> 00:06:44.260
these facts about real
world things.

00:06:44.260 --> 00:06:49.270
Whereas Cyc is aiming to model
common-sense knowledge about

00:06:49.270 --> 00:06:52.350
the world and let AI researchers
and developers

00:06:52.350 --> 00:06:54.920
program with that sort of

00:06:54.920 --> 00:06:58.660
intuitive real-world knowledge.

00:06:58.660 --> 00:07:00.840
So it's a little bit
different in scope.

00:07:00.840 --> 00:07:02.940
Freebase is also built
up by an open

00:07:02.940 --> 00:07:04.550
community like I said before.

00:07:04.550 --> 00:07:06.610
So anyone can contribute.

00:07:06.610 --> 00:07:11.540
Cyc was designed by Cycorp, and
they've designed most of

00:07:11.540 --> 00:07:14.200
the schema and the objects
on their database.

00:07:14.200 --> 00:07:14.620
JAREK WILKIEWICZ: I see.

00:07:14.620 --> 00:07:18.140
So it sounds like Freebase has
the objects entities, the

00:07:18.140 --> 00:07:21.980
relationships, where Cyc is also
focused on the assertions

00:07:21.980 --> 00:07:23.880
based on the knowledge
that they have

00:07:23.880 --> 00:07:25.120
accumulated in their system.

00:07:25.120 --> 00:07:26.670
SHAWN SIMISTER: Yeah, there's
a lot more rules in Cyc.

00:07:26.670 --> 00:07:28.180
JAREK WILKIEWICZ:
I see, I see.

00:07:28.180 --> 00:07:28.640
Cool.

00:07:28.640 --> 00:07:31.345
GREG SCHECHTER: So you mentioned
that Freebase is an

00:07:31.345 --> 00:07:33.130
open community and stuff and
people can contribute.

00:07:33.130 --> 00:07:34.230
What does that involve?

00:07:34.230 --> 00:07:37.650
How are they contributing
to it?

00:07:37.650 --> 00:07:38.670
SHAWN SIMISTER: So
it's very easy.

00:07:38.670 --> 00:07:42.120
It's a lot like the Wikipedia
model where anyone can jump in

00:07:42.120 --> 00:07:47.030
and contribute as little as one
factor, as much as a whole

00:07:47.030 --> 00:07:50.470
domain of facts with all the
schema and everything.

00:07:50.470 --> 00:07:53.580
So anyone with a Google account
can register, can log

00:07:53.580 --> 00:07:55.310
into Freebase.

00:07:55.310 --> 00:07:58.290
They can go to any topic, any
one of the 23 million topics

00:07:58.290 --> 00:07:58.890
in Freebase.

00:07:58.890 --> 00:07:59.770
They can add facts.

00:07:59.770 --> 00:08:02.230
They can change facts.

00:08:02.230 --> 00:08:04.490
It's like a Wiki so you can see
a history of which facts

00:08:04.490 --> 00:08:05.860
have been changed.

00:08:05.860 --> 00:08:07.680
And then they can build
their own schema.

00:08:07.680 --> 00:08:11.370
And there's a way that those
schemas can get promoted so

00:08:11.370 --> 00:08:15.050
that they become common schema
that everyone uses.

00:08:15.050 --> 00:08:15.650
JAREK WILKIEWICZ: Nice.

00:08:15.650 --> 00:08:20.430
And you were talking
about the schema

00:08:20.430 --> 00:08:21.760
relationships' entities.

00:08:21.760 --> 00:08:26.990
Now this is an API show, so is
there an API that I can use?

00:08:26.990 --> 00:08:31.170
And then additionally, I heard
that you can actually get

00:08:31.170 --> 00:08:34.250
access to the real data, so can
you tell us a little bit

00:08:34.250 --> 00:08:35.230
more about that?

00:08:35.230 --> 00:08:35.740
SHAWN SIMISTER: Absolutely.

00:08:35.740 --> 00:08:38.850
So Freebase is a big
graph database.

00:08:38.850 --> 00:08:41.320
Everything is stored
in the graph.

00:08:41.320 --> 00:08:44.260
So you can use our APIs to query
all of those things--

00:08:44.260 --> 00:08:47.430
the schema, the topics, even
the users, and all

00:08:47.430 --> 00:08:48.730
that sort of stuff.

00:08:48.730 --> 00:08:52.260
So we have free APIs
that anyone can use

00:08:52.260 --> 00:08:53.110
to query the data.

00:08:53.110 --> 00:08:56.160
And we also, like you said, we
have a complete data dump.

00:08:56.160 --> 00:08:58.800
So you can download every single
fact in Freebase onto

00:08:58.800 --> 00:09:02.080
your own computer, do whatever
you like with it.

00:09:02.080 --> 00:09:05.760
It's a Creative Commons
attribution license.

00:09:05.760 --> 00:09:09.460
So as long as you give us a
little credit, you can do

00:09:09.460 --> 00:09:11.530
anything you want with
all this data.

00:09:11.530 --> 00:09:12.540
JAREK WILKIEWICZ: Neat, neat.

00:09:12.540 --> 00:09:14.730
So can you show us couple
of examples of how

00:09:14.730 --> 00:09:15.370
you work with it?

00:09:15.370 --> 00:09:18.340
Let's see if we can switch
to your laptop.

00:09:23.410 --> 00:09:24.820
SHAWN SIMISTER: Is that
showing up there?

00:09:24.820 --> 00:09:26.070
JAREK WILKIEWICZ: We good?

00:09:28.550 --> 00:09:33.430
SHAWN SIMISTER: So this is one
example of using Freebase data

00:09:33.430 --> 00:09:36.190
to organize a lot of content
around topics.

00:09:36.190 --> 00:09:39.110
And so this is a start-up
called Link TV.

00:09:39.110 --> 00:09:43.370
And they're doing news around
real-world topics, and they've

00:09:43.370 --> 00:09:44.330
used Freebase to
organize that.

00:09:44.330 --> 00:09:48.340
So you can see there's a lot
of news about Lebanon and

00:09:48.340 --> 00:09:49.480
Syria right now.

00:09:49.480 --> 00:09:54.010
And if you click on Lebanon,
that's going to take you to a

00:09:54.010 --> 00:09:57.080
topic page about Lebanon.

00:09:57.080 --> 00:09:59.120
And you can see they've pulled
in some data here from

00:09:59.120 --> 00:10:02.150
Freebase, a description, an
image, that sort of thing.

00:10:02.150 --> 00:10:04.300
JAREK WILKIEWICZ: Is the image
stored by Freebase as well?

00:10:04.300 --> 00:10:06.340
SHAWN SIMISTER: Yes,
it is, yeah.

00:10:06.340 --> 00:10:11.530
And then they're able to show
relevant videos around that

00:10:11.530 --> 00:10:13.340
similar to I think what
we're going to be

00:10:13.340 --> 00:10:14.553
talking about today.

00:10:14.553 --> 00:10:15.480
JAREK WILKIEWICZ: Great.

00:10:15.480 --> 00:10:16.980
And then Developer view.

00:10:16.980 --> 00:10:20.490
This is a very nice presentation
of the data.

00:10:20.490 --> 00:10:22.990
Can you show us, how
does a developer

00:10:22.990 --> 00:10:24.820
interact with Freebase?

00:10:24.820 --> 00:10:26.250
SHAWN SIMISTER: So there's a
number of different ways.

00:10:26.250 --> 00:10:33.090
We have Search API, which lets
you take keywords and enter

00:10:33.090 --> 00:10:35.800
those keywords into the Search
API, and get back a ranked

00:10:35.800 --> 00:10:37.150
list of results.

00:10:37.150 --> 00:10:39.510
So topics that we think closely
match the keywords

00:10:39.510 --> 00:10:41.540
that you gave us.

00:10:41.540 --> 00:10:44.770
Then we have the Topic API,
which is kind of the other

00:10:44.770 --> 00:10:48.410
side of the Search API, which is
you give us a Freebase ID.

00:10:48.410 --> 00:10:51.020
So those ranked list of search
results before each one will

00:10:51.020 --> 00:10:52.220
have a topic ID.

00:10:52.220 --> 00:10:55.410
But once you have the topic ID,
you can pass that into the

00:10:55.410 --> 00:10:58.420
Freebase API, and we'll give
you back every fact that we

00:10:58.420 --> 00:11:00.340
know about that topic.

00:11:00.340 --> 00:11:02.080
And that's in real time.

00:11:02.080 --> 00:11:04.550
So if you go and edit Freebase,
the Topic API is

00:11:04.550 --> 00:11:06.880
updated automatically.

00:11:06.880 --> 00:11:10.650
And then the last API that we
have is called the MQL--

00:11:10.650 --> 00:11:11.430
"Mickle"--

00:11:11.430 --> 00:11:12.830
Read API.

00:11:12.830 --> 00:11:13.340
And that let's--

00:11:13.340 --> 00:11:14.510
JAREK WILKIEWICZ: Why
is it called MQL?

00:11:14.510 --> 00:11:16.510
SHAWN SIMISTER: That's the
Metaweb Query Language.

00:11:16.510 --> 00:11:18.250
JAREK WILKIEWICZ: All right,
Metaweb was the company that

00:11:18.250 --> 00:11:18.970
Google acquired--

00:11:18.970 --> 00:11:19.290
SHAWN SIMISTER: Yeah,
the original.

00:11:19.290 --> 00:11:20.420
JAREK WILKIEWICZ: --when
they started Freebase.

00:11:20.420 --> 00:11:22.080
SHAWN SIMISTER: Yes.

00:11:22.080 --> 00:11:28.250
And so The MQL Query API lets
you write more complicated

00:11:28.250 --> 00:11:29.030
structured queries.

00:11:29.030 --> 00:11:33.220
So you can ask it things like,
give me a list of all the

00:11:33.220 --> 00:11:37.430
actresses who've won awards for
films which were adapted

00:11:37.430 --> 00:11:38.880
from books.

00:11:38.880 --> 00:11:40.470
And normally in a relational
databases, that

00:11:40.470 --> 00:11:41.650
would be a lot of joins.

00:11:41.650 --> 00:11:43.280
But in a graph database, you're
just kind of hopping

00:11:43.280 --> 00:11:44.640
through all these
relationships.

00:11:44.640 --> 00:11:45.640
JAREK WILKIEWICZ: Hence
the Knowledge Graph.

00:11:45.640 --> 00:11:47.740
SHAWN SIMISTER: Yeah, exactly.

00:11:47.740 --> 00:11:53.310
So we actually have this Query
Editor here, which lets you

00:11:53.310 --> 00:11:56.390
write those queries in the
MQL query language.

00:11:56.390 --> 00:12:01.840
So you can see here, the query
is just nested JSON objects,

00:12:01.840 --> 00:12:05.940
and you're specifying
types and properties

00:12:05.940 --> 00:12:08.400
using Freebase schema.

00:12:08.400 --> 00:12:11.430
And all the null values that I
have here are things that we

00:12:11.430 --> 00:12:14.180
want to get back from the API.

00:12:14.180 --> 00:12:14.990
So it's going to fill in--

00:12:14.990 --> 00:12:16.120
JAREK WILKIEWICZ: So it's like
a template-based approach?

00:12:16.120 --> 00:12:16.600
SHAWN SIMISTER: Exactly.

00:12:16.600 --> 00:12:18.640
It's a template-based
query language.

00:12:18.640 --> 00:12:21.820
So it's a little bit different
if you're used to SQL-type

00:12:21.820 --> 00:12:23.790
query languages.

00:12:23.790 --> 00:12:25.640
But it's very easy to learn.

00:12:25.640 --> 00:12:28.150
It's just plugging in all
the Freebase schema.

00:12:28.150 --> 00:12:32.780
And then I'm going
to click Run.

00:12:32.780 --> 00:12:35.030
You get back this structured
list of results.

00:12:35.030 --> 00:12:37.510
You can see everywhere where I
had null, it's been filled in

00:12:37.510 --> 00:12:38.860
with values.

00:12:38.860 --> 00:12:43.460
So you can see Dakota Fanning
won an award for "War of the

00:12:43.460 --> 00:12:46.400
Worlds," which was a movie which
was based on a book.

00:12:46.400 --> 00:12:49.140
And so all this information is
available as JSON in your

00:12:49.140 --> 00:12:49.730
application.

00:12:49.730 --> 00:12:53.160
You can parse that out, do
whatever you like with it.

00:12:53.160 --> 00:12:54.730
And you can actually
just click up here.

00:12:54.730 --> 00:12:57.200
There's a link to
the MQL Read.

00:12:57.200 --> 00:13:01.770
And this is the actual raw API
request that you need to do to

00:13:01.770 --> 00:13:02.900
get that in there.

00:13:02.900 --> 00:13:03.650
JAREK WILKIEWICZ: So
it's a RESTful API.

00:13:03.650 --> 00:13:05.080
You can pick JSON.

00:13:05.080 --> 00:13:09.660
And then can you use the Google
APIs to interact with

00:13:09.660 --> 00:13:10.630
that as well?

00:13:10.630 --> 00:13:11.120
SHAWN SIMISTER: Yes.

00:13:11.120 --> 00:13:15.170
So the new Freebase APIs are all
compatible with the Google

00:13:15.170 --> 00:13:16.530
API clients.

00:13:16.530 --> 00:13:18.530
So you can use those clients
to parse this.

00:13:18.530 --> 00:13:20.510
JAREK WILKIEWICZ: So if I go to
the Developer console and

00:13:20.510 --> 00:13:23.400
select Services, you will
actually see Freebase?

00:13:23.400 --> 00:13:23.840
SHAWN SIMISTER: You'll
see Freebase.

00:13:23.840 --> 00:13:24.375
JAREK WILKIEWICZ: --in
the listing.

00:13:24.375 --> 00:13:24.730
SHAWN SIMISTER: Exactly.

00:13:24.730 --> 00:13:25.530
JAREK WILKIEWICZ: OK.

00:13:25.530 --> 00:13:25.990
Great.

00:13:25.990 --> 00:13:27.070
And right now it's open.

00:13:27.070 --> 00:13:27.890
Anybody can use it.

00:13:27.890 --> 00:13:29.920
Just add it to your
application.

00:13:29.920 --> 00:13:30.710
SHAWN SIMISTER: Yeah, it's
completely free.

00:13:30.710 --> 00:13:36.200
There's a quota of I believe
10,000 requests you can make

00:13:36.200 --> 00:13:38.890
in a day, so pretty generous.

00:13:38.890 --> 00:13:41.330
And if you have needs where you
need to do more than that,

00:13:41.330 --> 00:13:42.730
you can talk to us as well

00:13:42.730 --> 00:13:44.430
JAREK WILKIEWICZ: OK, cool.

00:13:44.430 --> 00:13:47.870
I know I Greg has been
hacking actually with

00:13:47.870 --> 00:13:50.550
Freebase API as well.

00:13:50.550 --> 00:13:53.630
And this is a YouTube
API show.

00:13:53.630 --> 00:13:58.890
So Greg, tell us a little more
about YouTube API, how that

00:13:58.890 --> 00:14:01.810
relates to Freebase, maybe
show us the example.

00:14:01.810 --> 00:14:05.920
I know Jeff, who is out on
vacation, actually started

00:14:05.920 --> 00:14:09.030
working on this project
a few weeks back.

00:14:09.030 --> 00:14:13.290
So this is the first
public preview of

00:14:13.290 --> 00:14:14.960
Jeff was able to achieve.

00:14:14.960 --> 00:14:16.880
But I know you've been looking
into it, so tell us

00:14:16.880 --> 00:14:17.920
a little bit more.

00:14:17.920 --> 00:14:21.110
GREG SCHECHTER: Yeah, so I'm
going to pull up this Topic

00:14:21.110 --> 00:14:22.760
Explorer is what we call it.

00:14:28.520 --> 00:14:30.500
It's basically just a way
to sort of browse

00:14:30.500 --> 00:14:32.100
the Freebase stuff.

00:14:32.100 --> 00:14:35.500
And so if we pull it up
on the computer here.

00:14:35.500 --> 00:14:42.240
I can log into it with
my personal account.

00:14:42.240 --> 00:14:43.210
JAREK WILKIEWICZ: So what
you're doing is

00:14:43.210 --> 00:14:45.550
basically Auth flow.

00:14:45.550 --> 00:14:48.720
GREG SCHECHTER: And so this is
using the Google standard

00:14:48.720 --> 00:14:52.110
authorization client libraries
in JavaScript.

00:14:52.110 --> 00:14:54.360
And then it's going to fetch
some information about me.

00:14:54.360 --> 00:14:56.090
It's got my username there.

00:14:56.090 --> 00:15:01.060
And now it shows me all this
stuff, all these tags that

00:15:01.060 --> 00:15:02.090
sort of relate to me.

00:15:02.090 --> 00:15:05.940
And I really like of the first
one happens to be about cats,

00:15:05.940 --> 00:15:07.015
because I guess--

00:15:07.015 --> 00:15:07.370
JAREK WILKIEWICZ: Shocker.

00:15:07.370 --> 00:15:10.510
GREG SCHECHTER: --I like
my cat videos a lot.

00:15:10.510 --> 00:15:11.870
SHAWN SIMISTER: Now
are those YouTube

00:15:11.870 --> 00:15:13.610
tags or Freebase topics?

00:15:13.610 --> 00:15:16.780
GREG SCHECHTER: So these are
Freebase topics that I guess

00:15:16.780 --> 00:15:20.210
are being pulled from
information that it knows

00:15:20.210 --> 00:15:23.870
about me from my YouTube
habits--

00:15:23.870 --> 00:15:26.530
what I like, what I watch,
and things like that.

00:15:26.530 --> 00:15:31.550
So clearly I pay attention to
cat videos and HTML5 stuff,

00:15:31.550 --> 00:15:35.600
and it looks like I watch
CollegeHumor and

00:15:35.600 --> 00:15:37.360
other things like that.

00:15:37.360 --> 00:15:40.860
So if I do a simple search,
I do like cats so

00:15:40.860 --> 00:15:42.260
I'll keep it that.

00:15:42.260 --> 00:15:45.610
Now it pulls in a bunch
of Freebase topics.

00:15:45.610 --> 00:15:48.610
And so I can see like, well,
there's the organism.

00:15:48.610 --> 00:15:54.680
There's things like there's a
football team here, cat eyes

00:15:54.680 --> 00:15:55.500
as an invention.

00:15:55.500 --> 00:15:57.220
There's all sorts of
different things.

00:15:57.220 --> 00:16:01.260
So I'll pick one of these.

00:16:01.260 --> 00:16:03.910
I'll just go with
the feral cat.

00:16:03.910 --> 00:16:07.670
And when I click that, it goes
and fetches a bunch of

00:16:07.670 --> 00:16:09.710
different YouTube entities.

00:16:09.710 --> 00:16:11.610
So we have channels.

00:16:11.610 --> 00:16:14.710
So there's one channel that's
about feral cats.

00:16:14.710 --> 00:16:17.070
So we have a lot of
different videos.

00:16:17.070 --> 00:16:22.220
And then from here, I can do
things like I can play a video

00:16:22.220 --> 00:16:24.450
by just clicking on it.

00:16:24.450 --> 00:16:26.790
Oh, well, this one's doesn't
happen to be available.

00:16:26.790 --> 00:16:31.000
Let's see if this
other one is.

00:16:31.000 --> 00:16:31.390
Good.

00:16:31.390 --> 00:16:36.220
So it's just playing a video
from "The Stray Cats," which

00:16:36.220 --> 00:16:38.070
happens to be a music group.

00:16:38.070 --> 00:16:39.050
And you know what?

00:16:39.050 --> 00:16:41.220
I like this video, so
I can Like it here.

00:16:41.220 --> 00:16:44.300
And so this is a very simple
demo that just goes through

00:16:44.300 --> 00:16:46.930
and uses a lot of these APIs.

00:16:46.930 --> 00:16:48.440
So I'm going to dive
into the code.

00:16:48.440 --> 00:16:50.000
JAREK WILKIEWICZ: So before you
go there, just to recap.

00:16:50.000 --> 00:16:54.850
So the features that this
application uses are Universal

00:16:54.850 --> 00:16:55.590
Search, right?

00:16:55.590 --> 00:16:58.310
Because when you typed in
"cats," we got not only videos

00:16:58.310 --> 00:16:59.090
but also channels.

00:16:59.090 --> 00:17:01.870
So this is something
new in API v3.

00:17:01.870 --> 00:17:04.730
And also, the actual search
is no longer a

00:17:04.730 --> 00:17:05.800
keyword search, right?

00:17:05.800 --> 00:17:07.829
I think what is happening
under the hood is we're

00:17:07.829 --> 00:17:08.864
actually looking for a topic.

00:17:08.864 --> 00:17:10.130
GREG SCHECHTER: Yes.

00:17:10.130 --> 00:17:12.849
JAREK WILKIEWICZ: And then based
on the topic, we do the

00:17:12.849 --> 00:17:17.849
lookup for YouTube videos or
playlists or channels that

00:17:17.849 --> 00:17:19.980
relate to that specific
topic, right?

00:17:19.980 --> 00:17:22.720
So this is kind of the linkage
between the part that Shawn

00:17:22.720 --> 00:17:26.399
was talking about and what
the API v3 provides.

00:17:26.399 --> 00:17:28.930
So for those of you that are
watching, this is kind of the

00:17:28.930 --> 00:17:32.920
major difference between what
you could do in API v2, where

00:17:32.920 --> 00:17:35.590
you could do a keyword search,
you could do a string search,

00:17:35.590 --> 00:17:36.710
and it was all good.

00:17:36.710 --> 00:17:39.350
But this is a little more
powerful because you can

00:17:39.350 --> 00:17:42.900
actually search for concepts
that have semantic meaning.

00:17:42.900 --> 00:17:46.090
And then you look at these
concepts in Freebase, and then

00:17:46.090 --> 00:17:49.240
you query using the topic ID
that Shawn was describing.

00:17:49.240 --> 00:17:51.740
And then I think Greg is going
to show us exactly how that's

00:17:51.740 --> 00:17:53.380
done in the code.

00:17:53.380 --> 00:17:56.180
GREG SCHECHTER: So what I did
is I took just pieces of the

00:17:56.180 --> 00:17:58.400
code that I thought were
important for the API.

00:17:58.400 --> 00:18:02.800
So the first thing I have here
is just a bunch of constants

00:18:02.800 --> 00:18:06.360
that we laid out, and I'm going
to highlight the ones

00:18:06.360 --> 00:18:08.070
that I think are important.

00:18:08.070 --> 00:18:12.070
So the top two there, that's
for just doing Google

00:18:12.070 --> 00:18:13.930
JavaScript client requests, and
that's what we're going to

00:18:13.930 --> 00:18:17.280
use to hit a lot of
our YouTube calls.

00:18:17.280 --> 00:18:19.490
And at the bottom of the
highlighted portion, you can

00:18:19.490 --> 00:18:20.530
see the service and
the version.

00:18:20.530 --> 00:18:23.760
The service is YouTube and the
version v3/ And then I also

00:18:23.760 --> 00:18:26.690
have the Freebase URL in there,
and that's what we're

00:18:26.690 --> 00:18:31.420
going to do to gather all the
topics when we have a query.

00:18:31.420 --> 00:18:36.220
So the first thing that
we did in that demo,

00:18:36.220 --> 00:18:37.170
we did a topic search.

00:18:37.170 --> 00:18:39.000
I put in a query.

00:18:39.000 --> 00:18:42.090
I put in cats, and I got back
a bunch of different topics.

00:18:42.090 --> 00:18:43.480
So the code to do that
looks like this.

00:18:43.480 --> 00:18:46.710
And really, the part that does
the request is right here.

00:18:46.710 --> 00:18:53.240
It's a simple JSONP request,
and this is using the

00:18:53.240 --> 00:18:56.280
AngularJS JavaScript library
for this request here.

00:18:56.280 --> 00:18:58.730
So if you guys aren't familiar
with it, look it up.

00:18:58.730 --> 00:19:02.970
But it's just a simple JSONP
request, and we put in our

00:19:02.970 --> 00:19:07.740
query, which was cats, with
our API key and a

00:19:07.740 --> 00:19:09.370
couple other things.

00:19:09.370 --> 00:19:13.080
And so if I come to this page,
you can see that request is

00:19:13.080 --> 00:19:16.260
going to go to a URL that's
at the bottom there.

00:19:16.260 --> 00:19:20.460
And really it's just that URL
that I had in the constants,

00:19:20.460 --> 00:19:22.090
plus our query for cats.

00:19:22.090 --> 00:19:23.510
JAREK WILKIEWICZ: So this
is the Freebase API--

00:19:23.510 --> 00:19:24.480
GREG SCHECHTER: This is
the Freebase API.

00:19:24.480 --> 00:19:25.250
JAREK WILKIEWICZ:
--invocation.

00:19:25.250 --> 00:19:26.710
SHAWN SIMISTER: This is the
Search API that I was talking

00:19:26.710 --> 00:19:27.190
about earlier--

00:19:27.190 --> 00:19:27.660
GREG SCHECHTER: Exactly.

00:19:27.660 --> 00:19:28.610
SHAWN SIMISTER: --where
you take keywords

00:19:28.610 --> 00:19:30.810
and get topics back.

00:19:30.810 --> 00:19:34.340
GREG SCHECHTER: And the result
for that looks like what I

00:19:34.340 --> 00:19:35.590
have here on screen.

00:19:35.590 --> 00:19:39.210
And if I highlight the portion,
the cool part is the

00:19:39.210 --> 00:19:40.210
results here.

00:19:40.210 --> 00:19:42.780
And so I just pulled out the top
result, and it happens to

00:19:42.780 --> 00:19:46.970
be when you search for cat, the
first thing is, of course,

00:19:46.970 --> 00:19:47.680
you get a cat.

00:19:47.680 --> 00:19:49.880
And that's an organism
classification.

00:19:49.880 --> 00:19:51.410
And there's a couple other
things there, and it has a

00:19:51.410 --> 00:19:53.740
score, an ID, and an MID.

00:19:53.740 --> 00:19:57.450
And the MID is what we'll use
later when we're actually

00:19:57.450 --> 00:19:59.620
going to do our YouTube
Topics Search.

00:20:02.380 --> 00:20:06.580
So the next thing with YouTube,
for our v3 API, to do

00:20:06.580 --> 00:20:10.270
our request, this is kind of
a bigger chunk of code.

00:20:10.270 --> 00:20:14.730
But the things that are
important here, this top line

00:20:14.730 --> 00:20:18.450
here, which is just creating the
path, which will take to

00:20:18.450 --> 00:20:22.710
YouTube service, which is just
YouTube, and our API version,

00:20:22.710 --> 00:20:28.470
which is v3, and it'll send this
to the Google API client

00:20:28.470 --> 00:20:32.760
JavaScript library, with all
these different options that

00:20:32.760 --> 00:20:36.260
we'll see when we're actually
making these calls.

00:20:36.260 --> 00:20:38.820
So for the search one, for the
universal search like we're

00:20:38.820 --> 00:20:42.340
talking, it's very simple.

00:20:42.340 --> 00:20:44.460
It's just the service that we're
using a search, like I

00:20:44.460 --> 00:20:46.900
mentioned, and the params, we
have the topic ID, which is

00:20:46.900 --> 00:20:48.770
the MID from before.

00:20:48.770 --> 00:20:51.850
And we want to get the snippet
back, which will provide us

00:20:51.850 --> 00:20:55.210
with the details about
that video.

00:20:55.210 --> 00:21:01.450
And we also have a query in
there that will sort of limit

00:21:01.450 --> 00:21:04.430
it to the search term that
we're putting in.

00:21:04.430 --> 00:21:06.010
And so the URL is at
the bottom again.

00:21:06.010 --> 00:21:09.800
So now we have, with the Google
APIs, and the most

00:21:09.800 --> 00:21:12.830
important things there are
having YouTube, v3, and

00:21:12.830 --> 00:21:17.070
search, which is the service
that we're using.

00:21:17.070 --> 00:21:23.570
And then it drops in the topic
ID from before and has that we

00:21:23.570 --> 00:21:26.860
want our snippet with searching
for cats, and the

00:21:26.860 --> 00:21:29.570
key that we were using before.

00:21:29.570 --> 00:21:31.720
JAREK WILKIEWICZ: So before we
move forward, one important

00:21:31.720 --> 00:21:36.090
thing to note is that to use the
topic APIs, you actually

00:21:36.090 --> 00:21:39.990
have to do the lookup for the
topic ID first, with the

00:21:39.990 --> 00:21:40.830
Freebase API.

00:21:40.830 --> 00:21:43.810
And then you turn around and
feed that into the YouTube

00:21:43.810 --> 00:21:45.010
API, right?

00:21:45.010 --> 00:21:48.920
The cat's term was not actually
used with the YouTube

00:21:48.920 --> 00:21:51.170
API, but instead, it
was a topic ID

00:21:51.170 --> 00:21:52.960
retrieved from Freebase.

00:21:52.960 --> 00:21:54.460
GREG SCHECHTER: Right, so you
can certainly just use cats

00:21:54.460 --> 00:21:55.285
with YouTube API.

00:21:55.285 --> 00:21:55.560
JAREK WILKIEWICZ: Sure.

00:21:55.560 --> 00:21:57.040
GREG SCHECHTER: But if you want
to get more specific, you

00:21:57.040 --> 00:21:58.010
want to get your--

00:21:58.010 --> 00:22:01.810
in this case looking for
specifically organism, then

00:22:01.810 --> 00:22:04.730
yeah, you'd have to do the
Freebase search to get the

00:22:04.730 --> 00:22:06.310
topic ID first.

00:22:06.310 --> 00:22:08.415
JAREK WILKIEWICZ: As opposed
to the band, like in the

00:22:08.415 --> 00:22:08.890
example you were showing?

00:22:08.890 --> 00:22:10.790
GREG SCHECHTER: Uh-huh.

00:22:10.790 --> 00:22:13.980
And the response to that is
pretty hefty, but the

00:22:13.980 --> 00:22:16.260
important part is the different
items that you get.

00:22:16.260 --> 00:22:20.130
And so here, I just have
the first result again.

00:22:20.130 --> 00:22:24.770
And we see that if you look at
from the items, you look at ID

00:22:24.770 --> 00:22:27.240
and kind, you can see that it's
a YouTube video with the

00:22:27.240 --> 00:22:28.740
video ideas.

00:22:28.740 --> 00:22:31.000
And then the snippet portion
sort of gives you some more

00:22:31.000 --> 00:22:34.180
details, and it tells you
the channel ID that it's

00:22:34.180 --> 00:22:39.120
associated to, the title of it
--"Funny Cats in Water." Epic.

00:22:39.120 --> 00:22:40.950
That sounds like a blast--

00:22:40.950 --> 00:22:44.110
and it gives you descriptions
and thumbnails.

00:22:44.110 --> 00:22:45.780
So it's pretty simple
to get all this.

00:22:49.175 --> 00:22:54.280
So hopefully, you'll be able
to use these examples to do

00:22:54.280 --> 00:22:56.890
your own requests.

00:22:56.890 --> 00:22:57.160
JAREK WILKIEWICZ: Neat.

00:22:57.160 --> 00:22:59.370
Thank you for walking
us through the demo.

00:22:59.370 --> 00:22:59.645
GREG SCHECHTER: Oh,
no problem.

00:22:59.645 --> 00:23:01.350
JAREK WILKIEWICZ: It's
very, very exciting.

00:23:01.350 --> 00:23:04.910
I think one of the things that
we also have as a part of the

00:23:04.910 --> 00:23:07.380
YouTube API v3 that isn't
actually captured by the demo

00:23:07.380 --> 00:23:10.710
is, given a video or channel,
you can actually determine

00:23:10.710 --> 00:23:12.630
topics that are related
to that video.

00:23:12.630 --> 00:23:14.280
So it's really the opposite.

00:23:14.280 --> 00:23:18.430
What we were showing here is
search and then topics,

00:23:18.430 --> 00:23:21.740
although under the hood,
I think the original--

00:23:21.740 --> 00:23:23.870
I don't know for those of you
that were watching, how when

00:23:23.870 --> 00:23:26.750
Greg logged in, he actually
got a bunch of topics.

00:23:26.750 --> 00:23:29.840
So these were actually topics
determined based on his

00:23:29.840 --> 00:23:31.260
YouTube activity.

00:23:31.260 --> 00:23:33.930
The reason why that was possible
is because we went

00:23:33.930 --> 00:23:37.210
through the authenticated
access with Auth.

00:23:37.210 --> 00:23:39.300
By the way, Greg, was there
anything in the results that

00:23:39.300 --> 00:23:41.464
surprised you?

00:23:41.464 --> 00:23:43.150
About yourself?

00:23:43.150 --> 00:23:44.460
GREG SCHECHTER: Yeah.

00:23:44.460 --> 00:23:45.430
JAREK WILKIEWICZ: Cats, that
was not a shocker.

00:23:45.430 --> 00:23:46.660
GREG SCHECHTER: Cats
was not a shocker.

00:23:46.660 --> 00:23:47.740
I did see like--

00:23:47.740 --> 00:23:48.280
I don't know.

00:23:48.280 --> 00:23:49.400
I pull it up here now.

00:23:49.400 --> 00:23:55.305
And before, there were a lot of
references to "The Muppets"

00:23:55.305 --> 00:24:00.415
and Kermit the Frog, which
was a bit unusual.

00:24:00.415 --> 00:24:01.400
Although I do--

00:24:01.400 --> 00:24:02.730
I mean, I love "The Muppets."

00:24:02.730 --> 00:24:04.270
JAREK WILKIEWICZ: Well, the
machine thinks you like it so

00:24:04.270 --> 00:24:06.050
it's got to be right.

00:24:06.050 --> 00:24:07.980
GREG SCHECHTER: I definitely
love watching those videos.

00:24:07.980 --> 00:24:11.240
I didn't expect it to be so
prominent when I did the

00:24:11.240 --> 00:24:11.540
search, though.

00:24:11.540 --> 00:24:12.450
JAREK WILKIEWICZ: Yeah, when I
actually ran this for myself,

00:24:12.450 --> 00:24:15.150
I thought it was quite accurate,
the types of things

00:24:15.150 --> 00:24:16.140
I typically watch on YouTube.

00:24:16.140 --> 00:24:19.120
But yeah, so the point is that
you can also-- based on

00:24:19.120 --> 00:24:20.480
channel and based on
video, you can

00:24:20.480 --> 00:24:22.700
actually get the topics.

00:24:22.700 --> 00:24:25.000
So there's a part of the API
response that includes the

00:24:25.000 --> 00:24:26.100
Freebase topics.

00:24:26.100 --> 00:24:28.750
Then you can actually pivot and
look up information about

00:24:28.750 --> 00:24:33.010
these topics in Freebase and
maybe find related concepts,

00:24:33.010 --> 00:24:34.570
and related videos,
and so forth.

00:24:34.570 --> 00:24:38.370
So that's another part of
the API that we have.

00:24:38.370 --> 00:24:42.630
The API is still just a tester,
but we will be making

00:24:42.630 --> 00:24:46.910
some announcements, hopefully,
reasonably soon, around when

00:24:46.910 --> 00:24:49.240
we will be able to make
that available to

00:24:49.240 --> 00:24:50.810
the developer community.

00:24:50.810 --> 00:24:54.310
But Topics is a key feature
of the API v3.

00:24:54.310 --> 00:24:56.910
It's always Universal Search,
which I think is a very nice

00:24:56.910 --> 00:25:01.380
feature of the features
that are new in v3.

00:25:01.380 --> 00:25:01.660
Great.

00:25:01.660 --> 00:25:06.270
So let's look in the Moderator
queue if we have any questions

00:25:06.270 --> 00:25:08.670
from people who are watching.

00:25:08.670 --> 00:25:13.380
There's one question that I
think is relevant about

00:25:13.380 --> 00:25:15.700
YouTube and Google Developer
Relations--

00:25:15.700 --> 00:25:16.160
hiring.

00:25:16.160 --> 00:25:18.530
So Greg, are we hiring?

00:25:18.530 --> 00:25:20.530
GREG SCHECHTER: Yes,
of course.

00:25:20.530 --> 00:25:24.330
We're always looking
for more people.

00:25:24.330 --> 00:25:31.110
So we got positions for what
I do, which is Developer of

00:25:31.110 --> 00:25:33.000
Programs Engineer, and positions
for what you do,

00:25:33.000 --> 00:25:35.700
which is Developer Advocate.

00:25:35.700 --> 00:25:37.890
I don't think the differences
are all that great.

00:25:37.890 --> 00:25:42.270
We still work with our developer
community a lot.

00:25:42.270 --> 00:25:44.750
I'm still trying to figure out
exactly where the line is

00:25:44.750 --> 00:25:45.560
drawn, too.

00:25:45.560 --> 00:25:47.000
JAREK WILKIEWICZ: Yeah.

00:25:47.000 --> 00:25:52.250
I think one of the differences
is, I think on the Developer

00:25:52.250 --> 00:25:55.040
Advocate side, we probably have
to travel a little more

00:25:55.040 --> 00:25:58.380
than the Developer Programs
Engineer.

00:25:58.380 --> 00:26:03.200
Folks like you or Jeff who can
actually stay in the zone for

00:26:03.200 --> 00:26:06.520
longer and produce some of these
wonderful code examples

00:26:06.520 --> 00:26:08.880
that we were showing.

00:26:08.880 --> 00:26:09.170
Great.

00:26:09.170 --> 00:26:11.870
And then if you would like
to learn more about these

00:26:11.870 --> 00:26:15.970
positions, they're on
developers.google.com/jobs.

00:26:15.970 --> 00:26:19.020
I think these are all the
questions that are relevant

00:26:19.020 --> 00:26:21.950
that we have in the Moderator.

00:26:21.950 --> 00:26:24.440
So again, thank you
very much, Shawn.

00:26:24.440 --> 00:26:28.190
We're really looking forward to
playing more with Freebase.

00:26:28.190 --> 00:26:28.780
Greg, welcome.

00:26:28.780 --> 00:26:30.240
GREG SCHECHTER: It's
good to be here.

00:26:30.240 --> 00:26:33.790
JAREK WILKIEWICZ: Thanks for
co-hosting, co-starring today,

00:26:33.790 --> 00:26:36.190
looking forward to working with
you and going forward.

00:26:36.190 --> 00:26:39.420
And for those of you watching,
thank you very much.

00:26:39.420 --> 00:26:41.960
Next week, we will have an
exciting show for you as

00:26:41.960 --> 00:26:43.440
always Wednesday 10:00
AM, Pacific.

00:26:55.440 --> 00:26:56.690
