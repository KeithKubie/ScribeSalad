00:00:00.790 --> 00:00:04.680
&gt;&gt; From the Library of
Congress in Washington DC.

00:00:18.790 --> 00:00:22.560
&gt;&gt; SONYA LEE: My name is Sonya
Lee, a reference specialist

00:00:22.560 --> 00:00:26.390
at the Korean Collection
at the library.

00:00:26.390 --> 00:00:30.380
Really thank you for joining us
for the lecture, it's a history

00:00:30.380 --> 00:00:34.240
of North Korea without
Kim LLsung possible?

00:00:34.240 --> 00:00:37.260
Using the Library of Congress,
North Korean Collection

00:00:37.260 --> 00:00:42.860
to rethink those Korean
history by Dr. Andre Schmid.

00:00:42.860 --> 00:00:45.920
Dr. Andre Schmid is an
associate professor and Chair

00:00:45.920 --> 00:00:48.970
of the Department of
East Asian studies

00:00:48.970 --> 00:00:50.580
at the University of Toronto.

00:00:50.580 --> 00:00:57.130
As historian of North Korea, he
has visited the library annually

00:00:57.130 --> 00:00:59.670
for the North Korean Collection,
I don't know how many years,

00:00:59.670 --> 00:01:01.920
about 10 years, something
like that, yeah.

00:01:01.920 --> 00:01:06.040
So, he's well-known for his
award winning 2002 Book,

00:01:06.040 --> 00:01:10.690
The "Korea Between Empire
1895 to 1919" published

00:01:10.690 --> 00:01:13.770
by Columbia University Press.

00:01:13.770 --> 00:01:17.190
I heard he currently he is
working on the book on North Korea.

00:01:17.190 --> 00:01:22.830
Probably he can tell you
more about his book later on.

00:01:22.830 --> 00:01:26.250
North Korea is often referred
to as a hermit kingdom,

00:01:26.250 --> 00:01:30.550
due to the state enforced
isolation from outside word.

00:01:30.550 --> 00:01:33.620
The library has over 10,000 items,

00:01:33.620 --> 00:01:38.540
and then 274 journal
titles from North Korea.

00:01:38.540 --> 00:01:43.810
This primary source provide the
users with a greater access to old

00:01:43.810 --> 00:01:47.430
and new Korean materials for free.

00:01:47.430 --> 00:01:50.520
One of the strength of
the Library of Congress is

00:01:50.520 --> 00:01:52.760
that it contains the
biggest collection

00:01:52.760 --> 00:01:56.240
of North Korean materials
published in particular

00:01:56.240 --> 00:01:59.300
from the 1940s and 1950s.

00:01:59.300 --> 00:02:04.040
Some of the records are not only
unique to outside of North Korea,

00:02:04.040 --> 00:02:07.410
but are probably no longer
available in North Korea.

00:02:07.410 --> 00:02:11.020
Our collection has be
vital to the scholars

00:02:11.020 --> 00:02:13.090
and government officials trying

00:02:13.090 --> 00:02:16.710
to understand the policies
relate to North Korea.

00:02:16.710 --> 00:02:20.670
As attention high on the Korean
peninsula and the more scholars

00:02:20.670 --> 00:02:25.820
and then [inaudible] to study North
Korea, our collection has continued

00:02:25.820 --> 00:02:30.380
to provide a critical role
in leading this field.

00:02:30.380 --> 00:02:35.790
The materials covers the reach and
comprehensive breadth of subject

00:02:35.790 --> 00:02:41.540
but the major subject they use
recently are nuclear weapon,

00:02:41.540 --> 00:02:47.000
of course, and nuclear program
in North Korea, the total import

00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:52.210
and export statistics,
international relations, circus,

00:02:52.210 --> 00:02:54.330
physical culture, and sports.

00:02:54.330 --> 00:02:58.740
And cinema, even children's
literature.

00:02:58.740 --> 00:03:00.510
Now, without further ado,

00:03:00.510 --> 00:03:04.510
please give a big welcome
to Dr. Andre Schmid.

00:03:04.510 --> 00:03:11.570
[ Applause ]

00:03:11.570 --> 00:03:13.760
&gt;&gt; ANDRE SCHMID: Thank you for the
introduction, it's a true delight

00:03:13.760 --> 00:03:16.430
to come to the Library of
Congress, As Sonya was mentioning,

00:03:16.430 --> 00:03:19.260
I've been here many times
over the last few years,

00:03:19.260 --> 00:03:21.640
spending many hours
with the collection.

00:03:21.640 --> 00:03:25.470
I've got many friends in the
library, now and I wanted

00:03:25.470 --> 00:03:29.370 position:56%
to thank Dr. Shou [assumed spelling]
for inviting me to come back

00:03:29.370 --> 00:03:31.770
to meet those old friends and
hopefully make some new ones.

00:03:31.770 --> 00:03:35.610
I also wanted to thank the head of
the Korea Collection, Sonya Lee,

00:03:35.610 --> 00:03:38.860
who over the last few years
has really put up with a lot

00:03:38.860 --> 00:03:42.800
of pestering questions on my
part and irk some inquiries.

00:03:42.800 --> 00:03:45.320
She's really opened up
this remarkable collection

00:03:45.320 --> 00:03:49.730
that the library has
to me in ways that.

00:03:49.730 --> 00:03:51.950
Interference from my microphone?

00:03:51.950 --> 00:03:58.400
No. I'm not sure what that is.

00:03:58.400 --> 00:04:02.160
Anyway, I've had the opportunity to
spend many hours in the collection

00:04:02.160 --> 00:04:03.940 position:56%
and it's been a lot of fun actually.

00:04:03.940 --> 00:04:09.230
You don't usually associate North
Korea and fun in the same section.

00:04:09.230 --> 00:04:13.380
Yet what I want to try and do today
with you today is talk a little bit

00:04:13.380 --> 00:04:16.410
about the materials that I've
been using, give you a little bit

00:04:16.410 --> 00:04:20.560
of a glimpse into the
1950s and 1960s.

00:04:20.560 --> 00:04:23.360
And maybe take a step further
to suggest that the materials

00:04:23.360 --> 00:04:26.120
in this library, combined
with some new

00:04:26.120 --> 00:04:29.920
and different historical questions
can actually help us rethink some

00:04:29.920 --> 00:04:32.350
of the fundamental assumptions
about the way we've thought

00:04:32.350 --> 00:04:37.500 position:56%
of North Korean history, which in
turn might help us rejig the ways we

00:04:37.500 --> 00:04:39.780
think about North Korea today.

00:04:39.780 --> 00:04:44.420
What I hope to do is to show you
how by reading everyday materials,

00:04:44.420 --> 00:04:49.330 position:56%
right, that people throughout North
Korea were reading on a daily basis,

00:04:49.330 --> 00:04:55.170
published in Pomnyum, yet held
here in this great library,

00:04:55.170 --> 00:05:01.130
you can possibly get beyond a type
of Cold War analytical dead end

00:05:01.130 --> 00:05:04.500
in our histories, which tend
to over emphasize the power

00:05:04.500 --> 00:05:08.000
of the Kim family and the power
of the North Korean state.

00:05:08.000 --> 00:05:10.570
Something we generally
just don't talk about.

00:05:10.570 --> 00:05:13.570
I'll try to do so by examining
through these newspapers,

00:05:13.570 --> 00:05:17.110
these magazines and these
journals two crucial issues

00:05:17.110 --> 00:05:20.600
in postwar North Korea,
namely population mobility,

00:05:20.600 --> 00:05:24.440
the way people were moving
around, and urban consumption,

00:05:24.440 --> 00:05:28.350
eventually getting to questions
of fashion, like on the slide.

00:05:28.350 --> 00:05:29.690
This first slide I have up here.

00:05:29.690 --> 00:05:32.640
I've titled my talk "Is
a history of North Korea

00:05:32.640 --> 00:05:34.890
without Kim LLsung possible?

00:05:34.890 --> 00:05:39.990
It might be reworded to ask why
are we so obsessed with Kim LLsung

00:05:39.990 --> 00:05:43.460
and his two offspring Kim
Pyong-il and Kim Jong-il.

00:05:43.460 --> 00:05:45.420
The answer would seem
to be obvious, right?

00:05:45.420 --> 00:05:50.310
No other country has a single
family that has been able to amass

00:05:50.310 --> 00:05:54.220 position:56%
such extreme personal power over
the course of the twentieth century.

00:05:54.220 --> 00:05:58.220
The stature of the Kim family
horrifies us, at the same time

00:05:58.220 --> 00:06:01.610
as it gives us a type of
almost perverse pleasure.

00:06:01.610 --> 00:06:04.260
A strange combination of observable

00:06:04.260 --> 00:06:06.900
in everyday newspaper
and TV coverage.

00:06:06.900 --> 00:06:08.230
We've seen it this week.

00:06:08.230 --> 00:06:14.120 position:56%
Right so it's typical to find in a
newspaper like "The Washington Post"

00:06:14.120 --> 00:06:18.640 position:56%
that writers and editors continually
invoke the inflamed rhetoric

00:06:18.640 --> 00:06:20.460
of North Korea.

00:06:20.460 --> 00:06:24.830
So, I was talking about
newspaper coverage in every day.

00:06:24.830 --> 00:06:29.880
So, this notion that we
are both horrified and

00:06:29.880 --> 00:06:31.710
yet at the same time take pleasure.

00:06:31.710 --> 00:06:33.990
And we can see this in our
newspapers and the way editors

00:06:33.990 --> 00:06:38.460
and writers regularly refer to the
inflamed rhetoric of North Korea.

00:06:38.460 --> 00:06:42.110
Vocabulary like the seas
of fire, the running dogs

00:06:42.110 --> 00:06:46.040 position:56%
of imperialism are reproduced in our
newspapers both taking a pleasure

00:06:46.040 --> 00:06:49.230
at the somewhat idiosyncratic
and bizarreness of the language.

00:06:49.230 --> 00:06:52.540
At the same time as it is
almost a sense of horror

00:06:52.540 --> 00:06:53.900
that there's a political culture

00:06:53.900 --> 00:06:56.860
where such rhetoric
is taken seriously.

00:06:56.860 --> 00:07:01.330
And with all that sound, I
forgot to show you my images.

00:07:01.330 --> 00:07:07.700
So, our TVs are filled with images
originally [inaudible] and Pomnyum,

00:07:07.700 --> 00:07:12.380
marching soldiers goose stepping
their way through downtown Pomnyum.

00:07:12.380 --> 00:07:16.010
Most recently, with
missiles always overlooked

00:07:16.010 --> 00:07:18.460
by portraits of the leader.

00:07:18.460 --> 00:07:22.430
Mass games are constantly
on our TVs.

00:07:22.430 --> 00:07:26.630
Again, playing on our
fears about North Korea.

00:07:26.630 --> 00:07:30.390
But I think for my generation,
there's also a certain type

00:07:30.390 --> 00:07:32.740
of nostalgia in these images.

00:07:32.740 --> 00:07:36.580
A nostalgia for almost the
comforting days of the Cold War,

00:07:36.580 --> 00:07:41.130
where this type of representation
of communism was so familiar

00:07:41.130 --> 00:07:42.610
to people of my generation.

00:07:42.610 --> 00:07:46.640
This leads to rather bizarre
website such as this one,

00:07:46.640 --> 00:07:50.150 position:56%
Kim Jong-un looking at things, which
is just a constant reproduction

00:07:50.150 --> 00:07:53.120
of these on the spot
types of images.

00:07:53.120 --> 00:07:54.420
I'm going to come back to this,

00:07:54.420 --> 00:07:57.320
because I think what this image
does is it captures that as much

00:07:57.320 --> 00:08:00.320
of these images certainly
have a place in reminding us

00:08:00.320 --> 00:08:04.190
that North Korea is a
deeply repressive country.

00:08:04.190 --> 00:08:07.060
These images also come
with a deep paradox.

00:08:07.060 --> 00:08:09.750
If we scratch a little bit
deeper what we can see is

00:08:09.750 --> 00:08:11.810
that the consequence
of our own fascination,

00:08:11.810 --> 00:08:16.800
this strange combination of horror
and pleasure, is that such ways

00:08:16.800 --> 00:08:21.060
of writing and visualizing North
Korea, actually reproduce a version

00:08:21.060 --> 00:08:25.660
of the very Pomnyum propaganda
that we profess to be horrified by.

00:08:25.660 --> 00:08:29.330
Indeed, our coverage
comes close to repeating

00:08:29.330 --> 00:08:34.040 position:56%
within our own analytical frameworks
and our own conceptual categories.

00:08:34.040 --> 00:08:37.400
Some of the central tenants of
the North Korean personality cult.

00:08:37.400 --> 00:08:40.710
This might seem to be
a strange thing to say

00:08:40.710 --> 00:08:44.260
that we're being influenced
by North Korean propaganda.

00:08:44.260 --> 00:08:47.860
Yet, nowhere is this more
clear than our own obsession

00:08:47.860 --> 00:08:49.590
with the Kim family, which in

00:08:49.590 --> 00:08:52.740
so many ways reproduces
the same obsession

00:08:52.740 --> 00:08:55.260
about leadership that's
coming out of Pomnyum.

00:08:55.260 --> 00:08:58.400
In our own histories just like
in North Korean histories,

00:08:58.400 --> 00:09:01.540
Kim LLsung remains virtually
the sole historical figure.

00:09:01.540 --> 00:09:05.310
The only agent of historical
action, decision and change.

00:09:05.310 --> 00:09:08.140
I'll give you one quick example
on how this works itself out.

00:09:08.140 --> 00:09:11.830
It's common for research on North
Korea to simply use a speech

00:09:11.830 --> 00:09:14.040 position:56%
of Kim LLsung as a historical source

00:09:14.040 --> 00:09:17.320
to account what happened
on a certain issue.

00:09:17.320 --> 00:09:20.290
Embedded in this type of
methodology is an assumption

00:09:20.290 --> 00:09:23.630
that because we believe North
Korea is a totalitarian country,

00:09:23.630 --> 00:09:27.480
there are no limits to the
personal rule of Kim LLsung.

00:09:27.480 --> 00:09:32.800 position:56%
What Kim says in any given speech
translates into action on the ground

00:09:32.800 --> 00:09:35.980
with virtually no mediation.

00:09:35.980 --> 00:09:38.600
Now, when we think about the
twentieth century more globally,

00:09:38.600 --> 00:09:42.200
right, it's hard to imagine the
history of any other country

00:09:42.200 --> 00:09:47.560
where such a methodology just
quote the leader is acceptable

00:09:47.560 --> 00:09:48.860
or appropriate.

00:09:48.860 --> 00:09:50.900
When it comes to North
Korean history, however,

00:09:50.900 --> 00:09:54.580
what Kim says goes, as far
as history is concerned.

00:09:54.580 --> 00:09:56.580
Moreover, there's no way out.

00:09:56.580 --> 00:09:57.880
It's a dead-end.

00:09:57.880 --> 00:10:00.580
We use high-level North
Korean propaganda, speeches,

00:10:00.580 --> 00:10:03.380
declarations of party
congresses, the editorials

00:10:03.380 --> 00:10:05.350
of the main newspaper,
legal statutes,

00:10:05.350 --> 00:10:08.730
TV news broadcast,
etcetera as our sources.

00:10:08.730 --> 00:10:12.110
All of which have the promotion
of the personality cult of one

00:10:12.110 --> 00:10:16.100 position:56%
of their priorities and that the key
assumption of Kim is at the center

00:10:16.100 --> 00:10:19.240
of all this action and this is what
we reproduce in our own studies.

00:10:19.240 --> 00:10:22.440
There's a circularity in this,
and I think we can find it

00:10:22.440 --> 00:10:24.340
in a website like this right.

00:10:24.340 --> 00:10:27.750
It's talking about Kim
Jong and looking at things.

00:10:27.750 --> 00:10:29.100
But what's not in the title is

00:10:29.100 --> 00:10:31.310
that we are looking
at the website, right.

00:10:31.310 --> 00:10:35.200
We're constantly looking at the
leadership for what they're up to.

00:10:35.200 --> 00:10:38.330
And a source like this
gives us no way of talking

00:10:38.330 --> 00:10:41.770
about anything but the leadership.

00:10:41.770 --> 00:10:46.300
So, just like Kim Jong and
looking at things, this website,

00:10:46.300 --> 00:10:49.020
we can laugh at the
way Kim is exalted.

00:10:49.020 --> 00:10:51.900
But we can't get outside
its bounds, right.

00:10:51.900 --> 00:10:55.450
The pictures are still of Kim,
and we keep looking at them.

00:10:55.450 --> 00:10:58.920
We roundly criticized the
personality cult and instead

00:10:58.920 --> 00:11:01.700
of calling him the great
leader we might think of him

00:11:01.700 --> 00:11:04.120
as the great despot right.

00:11:04.120 --> 00:11:07.300
In other words, we flip the
normative assessment on its head.

00:11:07.300 --> 00:11:11.230 position:56%
Yet our criticism does not challenge
the fundamental narrative framework,

00:11:11.230 --> 00:11:14.490
or offer alternative
sources of historical agency.

00:11:14.490 --> 00:11:18.940
It's difficult to dislodge fixation
with the Kim family and at the risk

00:11:18.940 --> 00:11:22.300
of overstating things,
perhaps it's time that we admit

00:11:22.300 --> 00:11:24.110
that the greatest testament
to the power

00:11:24.110 --> 00:11:27.480
of the personality cult is
it reaches out from Pomnyum

00:11:27.480 --> 00:11:31.340
to influence our very own
histories of North Korea.

00:11:31.340 --> 00:11:32.790
This type of circularity

00:11:32.790 --> 00:11:37.380
and analytical dead-end was
once the case with Mow in China.

00:11:37.380 --> 00:11:39.850
Was certainly the case with
Stalin and the Soviet Union,

00:11:39.850 --> 00:11:41.790
and all the studies of Stalinism.

00:11:41.790 --> 00:11:46.060
But it's been decades since
historians have moved beyond

00:11:46.060 --> 00:11:50.090
such cartoonish understandings
of Stalin and Mow and,

00:11:50.090 --> 00:11:52.760
with more complicated
understandings of the relationships

00:11:52.760 --> 00:11:55.970
between leaders, states
and societies.

00:11:55.970 --> 00:11:58.260
Yet not so with North
Korean history right.

00:11:58.260 --> 00:12:04.370 position:56%
Kim remains transcendent to a
history that he himself makes rather

00:12:04.370 --> 00:12:06.800
than being a historical
figure who's made

00:12:06.800 --> 00:12:08.410
by his arrow in this assumption.

00:12:08.410 --> 00:12:12.220
This transcendence is arguably
the single most important feature

00:12:12.220 --> 00:12:15.850
of the personality cult and we
see it in our own histories.

00:12:15.850 --> 00:12:19.650
So, and this is a confession
or a self-criticism

00:12:19.650 --> 00:12:23.150
in North Korean language
right it's not so much

00:12:23.150 --> 00:12:26.190
that if you ask anybody is
Kim LLsung transcendent,

00:12:26.190 --> 00:12:27.940
they're going to say yes.

00:12:27.940 --> 00:12:31.940
But the framing of the history
puts them in such a position

00:12:31.940 --> 00:12:35.720
that his relationship with
all other social forces is

00:12:35.720 --> 00:12:39.320
such that he has that
exalted position.

00:12:39.320 --> 00:12:44.620
This would seem to imply that my
answer to the question is a north,

00:12:44.620 --> 00:12:47.400
is a history of North Korea
without Kim LLsung possible,

00:12:47.400 --> 00:12:49.930
has got to be no, it's
not possible, right?

00:12:49.930 --> 00:12:53.540
If Kim is history after all how
can there be a history without him.

00:12:53.540 --> 00:12:55.920
But here's where I want
to say not so fast.

00:12:55.920 --> 00:12:59.340
And I want to turn to the
materials of Library of Congress.

00:12:59.340 --> 00:13:02.800
The materials contained within the
walls of this building allows us

00:13:02.800 --> 00:13:06.510
to escape this type of
analytical predicament,

00:13:06.510 --> 00:13:08.280
or dead-end, as I called it.

00:13:08.280 --> 00:13:12.610
They do so by offering an
amazingly rich array of sources.

00:13:12.610 --> 00:13:15.210
Sources that North Koreans
read in their everyday life,

00:13:15.210 --> 00:13:20.280
from women's magazines that in
the 1950s and 1960s are talking

00:13:20.280 --> 00:13:24.420 position:56%
about unhappy housewives and all
the social problems around the home.

00:13:24.420 --> 00:13:27.640
Much in the way that Betty Friedman
is talking about the problem

00:13:27.640 --> 00:13:30.340
with no name in this country.

00:13:30.340 --> 00:13:35.410
We can read workers newspapers to
find criticisms of fellow workers

00:13:35.410 --> 00:13:38.080
who come into the factories
drunk and getting

00:13:38.080 --> 00:13:40.610 position:56%
into fights with their bosses right.

00:13:40.610 --> 00:13:43.120
This is not a highly
disciplined workforce

00:13:43.120 --> 00:13:45.780
if you take these stories
at face value.

00:13:45.780 --> 00:13:50.510
From a worker magazine,
let's see if I can get here.

00:13:50.510 --> 00:13:56.600 position:56%
So, here's one women's magazines
that talks about unhappy housewives.

00:13:56.600 --> 00:14:01.110
Here's a cartoon from a workers'
magazine that is using a cartoon

00:14:01.110 --> 00:14:06.390
to sort of poke fun at the dizzying
speed of changes in the late 1950s.

00:14:06.390 --> 00:14:09.500
You can see in the first frame
the workers going off to work

00:14:09.500 --> 00:14:12.540
and when he comes home, there
have been so many houses built,

00:14:12.540 --> 00:14:15.450
right that he can't find
where he lives right.

00:14:15.450 --> 00:14:19.970 position:56%
And we're all familiar with this
idea of the dizzying speed of change

00:14:19.970 --> 00:14:24.820 position:56%
and the fact that this is a
cartoon building on an understanding

00:14:24.820 --> 00:14:28.080
of the humor of the reader right.

00:14:28.080 --> 00:14:30.830
We know that this is a
widespread phenomenon.

00:14:30.830 --> 00:14:36.860
We can read children and science
magazines, popular science magazine

00:14:36.860 --> 00:14:38.520 position:56%
that show us that the current crisis

00:14:38.520 --> 00:14:42.290
on the peninsula has a cultural
history in the veneration

00:14:42.290 --> 00:14:45.790
of nuclear technology; from
x-rays to weapons that are seen

00:14:45.790 --> 00:14:49.900
as the pinnacle of
scientific achievement right.

00:14:49.900 --> 00:14:51.200
And so very much more.

00:14:51.200 --> 00:14:54.720
I've just listed a few of the
journals that are here I think

00:14:54.720 --> 00:14:59.390
in her introduction, Sonya
said there were 247 or 274,

00:14:59.390 --> 00:15:05.380
74 journals in the library
so the idea is often claimed

00:15:05.380 --> 00:15:09.070
that we don't have sources to
study North Korea only holds

00:15:09.070 --> 00:15:13.280
if you're interested in finding out
the inner secrets of the Kim family

00:15:13.280 --> 00:15:16.590
or the machinations of the
highest reaches of the party.

00:15:16.590 --> 00:15:19.810
For anyone interested in a
broader approach to history right,

00:15:19.810 --> 00:15:24.390
the Library of Congress is this
rich playground of possibilities.

00:15:24.390 --> 00:15:28.210 position:56%
For my own period, the 1950s and
'60s in which I'm writing a book on,

00:15:28.210 --> 00:15:30.470
I can't even come close
to reading all

00:15:30.470 --> 00:15:33.900
that is available in
this building, right?

00:15:33.900 --> 00:15:36.550
And frankly, I never thought
that would be the case.

00:15:36.550 --> 00:15:39.330
I've never thought you'd be able
to tell me that there's more

00:15:39.330 --> 00:15:44.230
than I can possibly as a primary
source to do North Korean history.

00:15:44.230 --> 00:15:46.100
Now, where did all these
journals come from.

00:15:46.100 --> 00:15:48.850
I don't know a lot about the
history of the collection

00:15:48.850 --> 00:15:52.110
but it's an important
question to ask,

00:15:52.110 --> 00:15:54.580
given that the United States
does not have foreign relations

00:15:54.580 --> 00:15:56.170
with North Korea, how
did these come right.

00:15:56.170 --> 00:15:59.220
As terrific as a librarian that
Sonya is, she can't just walk

00:15:59.220 --> 00:16:02.900
into a bookstore in
Pomnyum and buy books.

00:16:02.900 --> 00:16:08.320
You may notice on this particular
slide right on the missile head,

00:16:08.320 --> 00:16:11.890
there are three initials
scrolled FDD,

00:16:11.890 --> 00:16:14.330
that stands for the
Foreign Documents Division.

00:16:14.330 --> 00:16:17.110
A section of the CIA that beginning

00:16:17.110 --> 00:16:21.040
in the 1950s started acquiring
materials from around the world

00:16:21.040 --> 00:16:22.340
for intelligence purposes.

00:16:22.340 --> 00:16:26.020
This is one of those
classic Cold War projects,

00:16:26.020 --> 00:16:28.810
productions of knowledge projects.

00:16:28.810 --> 00:16:32.440
The sort of know your
enemy type of project

00:16:32.440 --> 00:16:35.620
that begins acquiring
these magazines.

00:16:35.620 --> 00:16:38.430
I don't know if this is the
source of all of the magazines

00:16:38.430 --> 00:16:43.160
because they don't all have
those initials on them.

00:16:43.160 --> 00:16:48.930
But you can also see another
clue, I think I missed a slide.

00:16:48.930 --> 00:16:50.500
Yeah, I missed a slide, sorry.

00:16:50.500 --> 00:16:54.580
So another clue is that
there's all these postal stamps.

00:16:54.580 --> 00:16:57.370
I think in the display that
Sonya's created in the library,

00:16:57.370 --> 00:17:01.940 position:56%
you can see that because the United
States did not have direct relations

00:17:01.940 --> 00:17:03.860
with North Korea, they had
to go through third parties

00:17:03.860 --> 00:17:05.330
to acquire the materials.

00:17:05.330 --> 00:17:09.120
So you see stamps from Prague,
from Warsaw, from Moscow,

00:17:09.120 --> 00:17:13.430
I seen one from Hong Kong,
which was the most curious one.

00:17:13.430 --> 00:17:18.140
So, clearly whoever was
purchasing these materials

00:17:18.140 --> 00:17:20.830
in the foreign documents division
was approaching third-party

00:17:20.830 --> 00:17:24.680
countries, sellers and
other socialist countries

00:17:24.680 --> 00:17:26.630
to get these materials.

00:17:26.630 --> 00:17:30.110
The results of the collection is
unrivaled in the United States.

00:17:30.110 --> 00:17:34.390 position:56%
In South Korea where national
security laws still restrict what we

00:17:34.390 --> 00:17:36.840
can say or write about North Korea.

00:17:36.840 --> 00:17:38.890
There's no equivalent
collection whatsoever.

00:17:38.890 --> 00:17:40.900
Some of you may know
that the Ministry

00:17:40.900 --> 00:17:45.140
of Unification has released
some materials that are

00:17:45.140 --> 00:17:48.260
in the central library it's
called the [foreign word]

00:17:48.260 --> 00:17:53.000
that doesn't come close
to reproducing what is

00:17:53.000 --> 00:17:56.210
in this collection, especially
for the early periods.

00:17:56.210 --> 00:18:02.020
The only library that possibly has
a collection rivals the Library

00:18:02.020 --> 00:18:04.120
of Congress, is in Russia,
the National State Library,

00:18:04.120 --> 00:18:08.260
the former Lenin Library, which
acted as a type of repository

00:18:08.260 --> 00:18:10.610
for all the socialist world.

00:18:10.610 --> 00:18:12.960
All these journals enable us

00:18:12.960 --> 00:18:18.770
to do just really follow all
sorts of lines of inquiry.

00:18:18.770 --> 00:18:23.120
I want to do sort of two quick
case studies for you today.

00:18:23.120 --> 00:18:27.590
The first one is on
population movement.

00:18:27.590 --> 00:18:30.120
Population movement, the mobility

00:18:30.120 --> 00:18:32.880
of individuals has always
been a contentious issue,

00:18:32.880 --> 00:18:35.420
on both sides of the
demilitarized zones.

00:18:35.420 --> 00:18:38.260
Especially in years after the war.

00:18:38.260 --> 00:18:41.980
It was used by both North and South
Korea in their propaganda battles

00:18:41.980 --> 00:18:43.680
to attack the other
side's legitimacy.

00:18:43.680 --> 00:18:46.890
You know the logic of
voting with your feet.

00:18:46.890 --> 00:18:50.160
Ever since this time, the inability
of North Korean subjects to choose

00:18:50.160 --> 00:18:54.380
where they lived, has served as one
of the key pieces in for example,

00:18:54.380 --> 00:18:57.660
recent human rights writing
about the north to show the lack

00:18:57.660 --> 00:19:01.170
of freedom in the north and the
repressive nature of its rule.

00:19:01.170 --> 00:19:02.950
And this is certainly true.

00:19:02.950 --> 00:19:06.840
From the North Koreans' perspective
however controlling the mobility

00:19:06.840 --> 00:19:09.410
of individuals was
considered necessary

00:19:09.410 --> 00:19:11.420
for central economic planning.

00:19:11.420 --> 00:19:16.320 position:56%
Only by knowing where everyone lived
could in theory, labor be allocated

00:19:16.320 --> 00:19:18.560
to the most urgent
sectors of the economy.

00:19:18.560 --> 00:19:22.940
And this was key to claiming
and all socialist economies

00:19:22.940 --> 00:19:26.880
that they could be more efficient
than the capitalist counterparts.

00:19:26.880 --> 00:19:31.430
Yet of course such control
was not so straightforward

00:19:31.430 --> 00:19:34.780 position:56%
and we can see this in the
specialty economic journals that are

00:19:34.780 --> 00:19:36.620
in this library's collection.

00:19:36.620 --> 00:19:41.440
The main one of which is called
Economic Research, Kim Jong-il.

00:19:41.440 --> 00:19:46.490 position:56%
Throughout the 1950s and 1960s, as
the country was recovering from war,

00:19:46.490 --> 00:19:50.920 position:56%
the economists writing this magazine
constantly noted the elusiveness

00:19:50.920 --> 00:19:52.490
of the population.

00:19:52.490 --> 00:19:56.980
And I want to just cite one
particular piece published in 1959

00:19:56.980 --> 00:19:59.400
by an economist and Kim
en Jong [assumed spelling]

00:19:59.400 --> 00:20:01.040
who is nobody special right?

00:20:01.040 --> 00:20:05.860
He's just an economic planner
who is writing and he's writing

00:20:05.860 --> 00:20:09.050
with a sense of frustration
at the inability

00:20:09.050 --> 00:20:11.830
of central state institutions
to stop people from coming

00:20:11.830 --> 00:20:14.130
to the cities from the countryside.

00:20:14.130 --> 00:20:19.620
He complains that for that year
fully 30% of the new labor force

00:20:19.620 --> 00:20:22.790
in the industrial and
transport sectors had come

00:20:22.790 --> 00:20:24.320
from the countryside.

00:20:24.320 --> 00:20:29.720
If we do the math, that means that
despite legal prohibitions more

00:20:29.720 --> 00:20:34.810
than 114,000 workers came to
the cities from the countryside

00:20:34.810 --> 00:20:38.230
against the plans of the party.

00:20:38.230 --> 00:20:40.210
It's an incredibly large number.

00:20:40.210 --> 00:20:41.710
But it's probably also
underestimated.

00:20:41.710 --> 00:20:43.610
Because that's only two
sectors of the economy

00:20:43.610 --> 00:20:46.670
and it doesn't include construction
which was the biggest one.

00:20:46.670 --> 00:20:47.970
And it just counts workers,

00:20:47.970 --> 00:20:49.870
it doesn't include
their families right.

00:20:49.870 --> 00:20:54.640
So, we have hundreds of thousands
of people in this period moving

00:20:54.640 --> 00:20:56.120
against the wishes of the party.

00:20:56.120 --> 00:20:58.780
How did this happen, especially
given everything that we've come

00:20:58.780 --> 00:21:01.140
to understand about
the power of the state.

00:21:01.140 --> 00:21:04.500
The many resources of the
Library of Congress allow us

00:21:04.500 --> 00:21:06.070
to piece together a
little bit of the story.

00:21:06.070 --> 00:21:09.360
I'm going to give you a very quick
version of what that story is,

00:21:09.360 --> 00:21:14.170
and it centers on the way North
Korean factories were organized,

00:21:14.170 --> 00:21:15.470
right.

00:21:15.470 --> 00:21:16.770
Something that probably you
didn't expect me to talk

00:21:16.770 --> 00:21:18.530
about is factory organization.

00:21:18.530 --> 00:21:23.350
But after the war, after the
devastating bombing that wiped

00:21:23.350 --> 00:21:26.740
out most of the factories,
there was this desperate need

00:21:26.740 --> 00:21:31.530 position:56%
to heighten production and the party
did not have very much economic

00:21:31.530 --> 00:21:32.830
expertise right.

00:21:32.830 --> 00:21:35.520
Most of the party cadres are
coming from the peasantry.

00:21:35.520 --> 00:21:39.470
And what they decide to do is they
decide to give those few people

00:21:39.470 --> 00:21:43.410
that do have economic knowledge
control of factories, right.

00:21:43.410 --> 00:21:44.800
It's partly a soviet system.

00:21:44.800 --> 00:21:46.680
It's called the single
manager system.

00:21:46.680 --> 00:21:52.290
But these people are given power to
sign contracts, to build housing,

00:21:52.290 --> 00:21:58.950 position:56%
and most importantly the local party
officials are being told do not

00:21:58.950 --> 00:22:01.480
interfere with these
economic managers,

00:22:01.480 --> 00:22:02.780
these factory managers, right.

00:22:02.780 --> 00:22:06.610
Because we want above all else to
increase production and as part

00:22:06.610 --> 00:22:13.550 position:56%
of that goal they're given the right
to fire workers and to hire workers.

00:22:13.550 --> 00:22:18.690
The problem is that at
this particular point

00:22:18.690 --> 00:22:21.970
in North Korean history there's
an extreme labor shortage.

00:22:21.970 --> 00:22:24.870
There's too much death
during the war right.

00:22:24.870 --> 00:22:28.440
North Korean population
falls by something like 12

00:22:28.440 --> 00:22:32.980
to 13% during the North Korean war,
during all of the Second World War,

00:22:32.980 --> 00:22:36.000
the only country in Europe
that lost a bigger percentage

00:22:36.000 --> 00:22:37.860
of its population is Poland, right.

00:22:37.860 --> 00:22:41.230
So, it's affecting simply the
number of bodies that are available

00:22:41.230 --> 00:22:42.930
to participate in the labor force.

00:22:42.930 --> 00:22:45.380
There's still all sorts
of inefficiencies

00:22:45.380 --> 00:22:48.830
in the way labor's been
allocated, but these managers are

00:22:48.830 --> 00:22:50.350
under incredible pressure.

00:22:50.350 --> 00:22:52.610
So, they do two things
in this context.

00:22:52.610 --> 00:22:56.840
One is they begin poaching
workers from other factories.

00:22:56.840 --> 00:22:59.480
Right? There's all sorts of
articles that criticize them

00:22:59.480 --> 00:23:01.610
for what is called a
disorderly practice.

00:23:01.610 --> 00:23:05.070
But there's no way to
stop them from doing this.

00:23:05.070 --> 00:23:10.070
But most importantly, they move
to evade the controls that sought

00:23:10.070 --> 00:23:12.960
to stem flows of people
from rural to urban areas.

00:23:12.960 --> 00:23:18.440
They basically ignore central
directives and begin hiring people

00:23:18.440 --> 00:23:21.240
that want to move to the cities.

00:23:21.240 --> 00:23:26.510
So, if from the central
perspective, planner sought to deal

00:23:26.510 --> 00:23:30.370
with depressing labor shortage
by trying to balance right

00:23:30.370 --> 00:23:34.260
from a macro perspective
where labor would flow.

00:23:34.260 --> 00:23:37.110
From that micro perspective,
from those managers

00:23:37.110 --> 00:23:41.760
that have this political pressure
on them to increase production,

00:23:41.760 --> 00:23:44.810
they don't care about
central attempts

00:23:44.810 --> 00:23:48.250
to balance labor force
across the country.

00:23:48.250 --> 00:23:51.550
They care about their immediate
need to increase production.

00:23:51.550 --> 00:23:55.810 position:56%
So, their short-term production
needs trumped the long-term national

00:23:55.810 --> 00:23:57.700
plans of the center.

00:23:57.700 --> 00:24:01.230
This just becomes one of the
way many places where we can see

00:24:01.230 --> 00:24:05.600
that central plans for the economy
are undermined through tensions

00:24:05.600 --> 00:24:09.180
with often the very different
interests of localities.

00:24:09.180 --> 00:24:12.740
Now there are many other
factors of the story.

00:24:12.740 --> 00:24:20.790
By 1962 right, so this is 9
years after the end of the war,

00:24:20.790 --> 00:24:23.900
the state is still having
trouble making complete

00:24:23.900 --> 00:24:25.200
population registers.

00:24:25.200 --> 00:24:27.570
There are many complaints,
especially in the countryside.

00:24:27.570 --> 00:24:29.560
People are just missing
from the registers

00:24:29.560 --> 00:24:32.580
and this gives them the
ability to move to the cities

00:24:32.580 --> 00:24:34.170
to leak out of the system.

00:24:34.170 --> 00:24:38.320 position:56%
The new construction of apartment
building created new types of spaces

00:24:38.320 --> 00:24:41.620
that were actually very challenging
to put under surveillance,

00:24:41.620 --> 00:24:45.680 position:56%
allowing families often to double
up inside these apartment buildings.

00:24:45.680 --> 00:24:49.840
Factory managers could also set
up their own housing to make space

00:24:49.840 --> 00:24:53.430
for new urban arrivals
from the countryside.

00:24:53.430 --> 00:24:56.470
All of these factors show
that by the mid-1960s,

00:24:56.470 --> 00:25:00.270
when my research stops all
indications are that due

00:25:00.270 --> 00:25:04.770
to these tensions between
national and local level planners

00:25:04.770 --> 00:25:07.790
and factory managers and
the still limited abilities

00:25:07.790 --> 00:25:11.080
of the state implement its
regulations, people were moving

00:25:11.080 --> 00:25:14.690
into the cities outside the
designs of central planners.

00:25:14.690 --> 00:25:17.710
State power clearly had its limits.

00:25:17.710 --> 00:25:20.560
Moreover, people had their
own ideas of where to live,

00:25:20.560 --> 00:25:23.180
and factory managers had
their own ideas of how

00:25:23.180 --> 00:25:25.190
to go about hiring workers.

00:25:25.190 --> 00:25:28.830
They worked in way to be allocated
workers from central state.

00:25:28.830 --> 00:25:31.510
Whatever the regulations may have
been on the books they're willing

00:25:31.510 --> 00:25:35.150
to take the risk and local
state institutions were unable

00:25:35.150 --> 00:25:36.970
to stop them.

00:25:36.970 --> 00:25:40.140 position:56%
Here, we can see the analytical
dead-end I discussed earlier working

00:25:40.140 --> 00:25:43.780
itself out in a slightly
different form.

00:25:43.780 --> 00:25:47.040
Our conventional understanding
of population as static,

00:25:47.040 --> 00:25:51.890
unable to move was derived from
reading Kim LLsung's speeches

00:25:51.890 --> 00:25:56.370
from the legal statutes that
are on the book and combined

00:25:56.370 --> 00:25:59.560
with our Cold War assumptions
about totalitarian power.

00:25:59.560 --> 00:26:02.380
This led us to believe
that Kim's words

00:26:02.380 --> 00:26:04.710
and the laws were thoroughly
implement.

00:26:04.710 --> 00:26:06.370
But this certainly wasn't the case.

00:26:06.370 --> 00:26:12.060
And as I tried to show the danger
when doing North Korean research is

00:26:12.060 --> 00:26:18.860 position:56%
that we take intentions as outcomes,
right, a basic historical falsie.

00:26:18.860 --> 00:26:22.400
Indeed, even that frustrated
1959 economist

00:26:22.400 --> 00:26:24.800
that I mentioned earlier
suggested as much.

00:26:24.800 --> 00:26:28.460
He wrote, and this was one of the
more shocking things that I read

00:26:28.460 --> 00:26:30.810
when I was first starting
off my research.

00:26:30.810 --> 00:26:34.270
He goes and says Kim LLsung's
words have been simply ignored.

00:26:34.270 --> 00:26:36.430
I never though I'd see the
written in North Korea.

00:26:36.430 --> 00:26:40.410
But you do find all sorts
of indications of that type.

00:26:40.410 --> 00:26:43.810
In this economist frustrations
then we can see that as much

00:26:43.810 --> 00:26:45.940
as he would've liked people

00:26:45.940 --> 00:26:49.450
to follow the words of
Kim LLsung's speech.

00:26:49.450 --> 00:26:50.750
They didn't.

00:26:50.750 --> 00:26:53.180
There was a much more
complicated socioeconomic

00:26:53.180 --> 00:26:58.860
and cultural history shaping the
demographics of the peninsula.

00:26:58.860 --> 00:27:03.100
One that can't be captured through
notions of totalitarianism alone,

00:27:03.100 --> 00:27:06.140
or simply reading through
these high-level sources.

00:27:06.140 --> 00:27:08.200
Let me shift to my
second case study now.

00:27:08.200 --> 00:27:12.290
I want to give you a really
quick history of consumption.

00:27:12.290 --> 00:27:13.950
Most historians of consumption

00:27:13.950 --> 00:27:16.210
under state socialism
have long recognized a

00:27:16.210 --> 00:27:18.010
fundamental ambivalence.

00:27:18.010 --> 00:27:20.370
On the one hand socialism's promise

00:27:20.370 --> 00:27:24.040
of a mass utopia included a
certain assurance of a level

00:27:24.040 --> 00:27:25.340
of material comfort

00:27:25.340 --> 00:27:27.680
for the population right
through consumption.

00:27:27.680 --> 00:27:30.980
On the other hand, Stalinist
economic models invested

00:27:30.980 --> 00:27:33.970
in heavy industry, ensuring
an emphasis on those sectors

00:27:33.970 --> 00:27:36.870
of the economy, the
underserved the very consumption

00:27:36.870 --> 00:27:38.760 position:56%
that was promised of the population.

00:27:38.760 --> 00:27:40.820
And this was no different
in North Korea right.

00:27:40.820 --> 00:27:42.860
Where similar decisions
about the priorities

00:27:42.860 --> 00:27:46.370
and economic investment
were made after the war.

00:27:46.370 --> 00:27:53.050
The ambivalence became manifest not
just at top-level policy positions,

00:27:53.050 --> 00:27:55.760
but at the personal
level of everyday life.

00:27:55.760 --> 00:28:00.690
In large number of pieces of advice
literature that are available to us

00:28:00.690 --> 00:28:04.950
in this library, that
sought to teach people how

00:28:04.950 --> 00:28:07.220
to be good socialists so to speak.

00:28:07.220 --> 00:28:09.690
There was this wide-ranging
discussion about labor

00:28:09.690 --> 00:28:12.720
and participation reconstruction,
about production.

00:28:12.720 --> 00:28:17.120
Yet, the issue of consumption, how
should a good socialists consume,

00:28:17.120 --> 00:28:21.300
was for the most part reduced
to a single simple point.

00:28:21.300 --> 00:28:24.580
The importance of saving
and not wasting.

00:28:24.580 --> 00:28:28.570
An emphasis on frugality on
self-help all these were promoted

00:28:28.570 --> 00:28:31.190
to act as a type of key

00:28:31.190 --> 00:28:35.930
to accelerating the growing
material prosperity of the country.

00:28:35.930 --> 00:28:41.270
This emphasis on frugality in turn
led to a type of unease or anxiety

00:28:41.270 --> 00:28:45.860
in the way that consumption came
to be represented in the press,

00:28:45.860 --> 00:28:48.670
in the media, in the
early years after the war.

00:28:48.670 --> 00:28:52.090
And sort of interesting
in this anxiety.

00:28:52.090 --> 00:28:56.180
Early reporting about the
construction and use of apartments

00:28:56.180 --> 00:28:59.500
for example, captures
this sense of ambivalence.

00:28:59.500 --> 00:29:04.120
Starting in 1954 well
I forgot this slides.

00:29:04.120 --> 00:29:07.430
So, this slide is the
classic type of cartoon

00:29:07.430 --> 00:29:09.300
that we talked about saving with.

00:29:09.300 --> 00:29:11.820
The first one, [foreign
word] means saving, right?

00:29:11.820 --> 00:29:14.960
So, you've got a happy family with
the worker who saved properly.

00:29:14.960 --> 00:29:17.660
The second one is about alcoholism,
the worker who's spending all

00:29:17.660 --> 00:29:21.000
of his money on booze and look
what happens to his family.

00:29:21.000 --> 00:29:23.430
This this type of cartoon.

00:29:23.430 --> 00:29:27.870
This type of discourse is
through the media in these years.

00:29:27.870 --> 00:29:32.590
And much of this discourse
focused on apartments.

00:29:32.590 --> 00:29:38.580
Since 1954, the party began
to make massive investments

00:29:38.580 --> 00:29:41.620
in workers apartment buildings,
transforming cityscapes

00:29:41.620 --> 00:29:44.690
of the peninsula, as
I hinted at earlier.

00:29:44.690 --> 00:29:46.840
Yet, despite all the celebration

00:29:46.840 --> 00:29:50.920
of how these apartments represented
the success of the revolution,

00:29:50.920 --> 00:29:54.260
the press was much more comfortable
about treating these buildings

00:29:54.260 --> 00:29:58.580
in terms of the construction
rather than their inhabitation.

00:29:58.580 --> 00:30:01.800
Thus, you get this
type of photograph.

00:30:01.800 --> 00:30:04.300
It's about the monumentality
of the building.

00:30:04.300 --> 00:30:07.180
The pictures are generally
from outside.

00:30:07.180 --> 00:30:12.800
When photographers did
venture into apartments,

00:30:12.800 --> 00:30:18.610
the photos are almost always
cropped, closely onto a family

00:30:18.610 --> 00:30:22.810
in a genre that might be
called the happy family photo

00:30:22.810 --> 00:30:26.070
without really allowing
the camera to pan

00:30:26.070 --> 00:30:28.250
across the space of the apartment.

00:30:28.250 --> 00:30:31.290
There's a certain reticence
to show the apartment

00:30:31.290 --> 00:30:32.590
as a space of consumption.

00:30:32.590 --> 00:30:36.130
And indeed, there's a
critique at this time,

00:30:36.130 --> 00:30:41.200
as we can see in this cartoon
here there's sort of a fear

00:30:41.200 --> 00:30:44.110
that women would get too
comfortable inside the apartments

00:30:44.110 --> 00:30:45.960
and not be interested
in going out to work.

00:30:45.960 --> 00:30:49.810
And here's one where we can see
at the top a woman is sleeping in,

00:30:49.810 --> 00:30:52.820
and she's doing her makeup
and her sort of comfort

00:30:52.820 --> 00:30:56.070
in his apartment space that
makes her late taking her kid.

00:30:56.070 --> 00:31:00.890
All right complaining at the end.

00:31:00.890 --> 00:31:03.240
So again, there's this
reticence to show the apartment

00:31:03.240 --> 00:31:05.540
as a space of consumption.

00:31:05.540 --> 00:31:08.730
Here I'm going to make a bit
of a jump and jump to the 1960s

00:31:08.730 --> 00:31:12.580
where you get a shift, and
the shift is quite stunning,

00:31:12.580 --> 00:31:14.410
I only saw it last time I was here

00:31:14.410 --> 00:31:18.370
at the Library of Congress
in November.

00:31:18.370 --> 00:31:21.890
There are two specific journals
called [foreign words], New Life,

00:31:21.890 --> 00:31:30.320
that begin in 1963, and I'm
not quite sure why it's 1963.

00:31:30.320 --> 00:31:35.530
Suddenly offering long
and many articles

00:31:35.530 --> 00:31:38.640
of what we would today
call lifestyle coverage.

00:31:38.640 --> 00:31:44.460
As one article in this period
asked, where does a rooms sense

00:31:44.460 --> 00:31:49.120
of harmonious beauty or taste of
cultural refinement come from.

00:31:49.120 --> 00:31:51.780
That's not easy to
answer in a few words.

00:31:51.780 --> 00:31:54.460
And indeed, there were many
words in these pages later

00:31:54.460 --> 00:31:55.980
to try and talk about this.

00:31:55.980 --> 00:31:59.130
That type of question where it's
invoking cultural refinement,

00:31:59.130 --> 00:32:02.810
harmonious beauty, would
just had no presence

00:32:02.810 --> 00:32:05.780
in the press just a
few years earlier.

00:32:05.780 --> 00:32:07.790
So, these articles talked about how

00:32:07.790 --> 00:32:11.510
to arrange the furniture
in one's home right.

00:32:11.510 --> 00:32:18.320
They began to discuss how to
hang pictures on the wall.

00:32:18.320 --> 00:32:20.740
Should you have vertical
versus horizontal pictures.

00:32:20.740 --> 00:32:25.120
Should you have sunlight
or curtains.

00:32:25.120 --> 00:32:30.080
Clearly the preference for pictures
were landscapes there's discussions

00:32:30.080 --> 00:32:34.010
about what color is best for what
type of room or even color charts

00:32:34.010 --> 00:32:36.640
for people to choose from.

00:32:36.640 --> 00:32:42.070
By this point we get no sense
of reticence or ill at ease.

00:32:42.070 --> 00:32:45.740 position:56%
In fact, when you look at these type
of pictures you can begin to see

00:32:45.740 --> 00:32:51.010 position:56%
that the camera is taking a step
back and it's beginning to show more

00:32:51.010 --> 00:32:56.660
about the objects through which
people lived their everyday life.

00:32:56.660 --> 00:33:02.920
Right? So, here's one chockablock
would not have met the design

00:33:02.920 --> 00:33:04.800
criteria of any article
I've ever read

00:33:04.800 --> 00:33:10.580
in North Korean presses too jammed
with tables and plants, right.

00:33:10.580 --> 00:33:12.970
Here's another one and
here this is featuring two

00:33:12.970 --> 00:33:15.120
of the main consumer
items from this period,

00:33:15.120 --> 00:33:17.850
the radio in the sewing machine.

00:33:17.850 --> 00:33:20.960
So, very much a well-off family.

00:33:20.960 --> 00:33:24.920
Right? Anybody know what's in
the middle of the table there?

00:33:24.920 --> 00:33:31.540
Goldfish. This goes as well for
the way furniture is discussed.

00:33:31.540 --> 00:33:32.840
You can see these ones.

00:33:32.840 --> 00:33:34.140
There's absolutely no people.

00:33:34.140 --> 00:33:35.440
You can see the painting.

00:33:35.440 --> 00:33:38.400
You can see that there's no Kim
LLsung portrait on the wall.

00:33:42.250 --> 00:33:44.120
Again, a very different sensibility

00:33:44.120 --> 00:33:47.060
of what could have been
discussed in an earlier period.

00:33:47.060 --> 00:33:50.170
This transfers over
to fashions as well.

00:33:50.170 --> 00:33:51.850
In particular, women's clothing.

00:33:51.850 --> 00:33:54.490
I'm not going to talk about this,
because I'm running out of time,

00:33:54.490 --> 00:33:59.830
but I just want to show you some
of these images from this period.

00:33:59.830 --> 00:34:07.610
And we can see that there begins in
the 1960s new forms of femininity

00:34:07.610 --> 00:34:11.230
that have a lot to do
with new forms of clothing

00:34:11.230 --> 00:34:16.830
that aren't the typical here's one
of the color charts for clothing.

00:34:25.620 --> 00:34:30.310
So we have these new forms of
femininity that don't fit into what

00:34:30.310 --> 00:34:34.830 position:56%
until this point fashion had largely
been either your work uniform

00:34:34.830 --> 00:34:38.180 position:56%
or you know the [foreign word] what
in South Korea is called the hanbok,

00:34:38.180 --> 00:34:40.600
the traditional Korean dress.

00:34:40.600 --> 00:34:43.500
There are all sorts of questions
that we can ask about these types

00:34:43.500 --> 00:34:46.000
of images, these types
of consumption, right.

00:34:46.000 --> 00:34:49.580
We can ask legitimately how many
people were actually consuming

00:34:49.580 --> 00:34:50.880
like this, right?

00:34:50.880 --> 00:34:53.470
We don't have good answers for.

00:34:53.470 --> 00:34:56.000
We can also ask what did it mean

00:34:56.000 --> 00:34:57.880
that this was being
publicly discussed right.

00:34:57.880 --> 00:35:00.300
This isn't a type of
secret form of consumption

00:35:00.300 --> 00:35:03.720
that only high party officials
are doing behind closed doors.

00:35:03.720 --> 00:35:06.730
These are pictures that are
circulating in magazines

00:35:06.730 --> 00:35:08.440
that have tens of thousands,
some of them have

00:35:08.440 --> 00:35:12.990
over 100,000 copies being printed.

00:35:12.990 --> 00:35:15.910
Just like in this country, even
if you can't afford everything

00:35:15.910 --> 00:35:18.750
that you see in the magazine
you can consume the images right

00:35:18.750 --> 00:35:20.130
and the promise of
what this might mean

00:35:20.130 --> 00:35:23.290
about the future, about
possibilities.

00:35:23.290 --> 00:35:25.220
We can ask what does
this consumption mean

00:35:25.220 --> 00:35:29.850
about postwar class formations
and uneven distribution of goods.

00:35:29.850 --> 00:35:33.090
It's also possible that we wonder
whether there were certain groups

00:35:33.090 --> 00:35:36.640
that taking advantage of that
ambivalence towards consumption

00:35:36.640 --> 00:35:40.410
that I spoke of earlier pushed
the promise of material comfort

00:35:40.410 --> 00:35:45.130
to create a space to speak
of consumption in new ways.

00:35:45.130 --> 00:35:49.040
This would put these consumers, or
these writers about consumption,

00:35:49.040 --> 00:35:52.020
together with the factory
managers and the urban migrants,

00:35:52.020 --> 00:35:56.930
that I spoke about in my earlier
case study as people whose behavior

00:35:56.930 --> 00:36:00.050
in these important rounds
moves beyond the type

00:36:00.050 --> 00:36:03.130
of top-down directives of
the leadership in the party.

00:36:03.130 --> 00:36:06.410
In other words, another
location of historical agency.

00:36:06.410 --> 00:36:09.690
However one chooses to
interpret this consumption,

00:36:09.690 --> 00:36:13.580
one thing is clear is if we're to
read Kim's speeches the resolutions

00:36:13.580 --> 00:36:17.650
of party congresses or even the
main newspaper, the [foreign word],

00:36:17.650 --> 00:36:19.660
right we would miss out completely

00:36:19.660 --> 00:36:23.320
on the significant economic
and cultural changes.

00:36:23.320 --> 00:36:29.310
So, the problem I described earlier
of taking intentions as outcomes,

00:36:29.310 --> 00:36:33.110
we can add the further problem
of simply not looking in places

00:36:33.110 --> 00:36:37.000
where we can locate
socioeconomic and cultural changes.

00:36:37.000 --> 00:36:39.810 position:56%
Ones that are not being unilaterally
produced by the leadership

00:36:39.810 --> 00:36:42.700
or the party, but which
in fact contribute

00:36:42.700 --> 00:36:46.950
to shaping the possibilities of
postwar politics in North Korea.

00:36:46.950 --> 00:36:50.520
So, let me conclude by doing
what a historian should never do,

00:36:50.520 --> 00:36:54.790
make a few comments about the
current situation in North Korea.

00:36:54.790 --> 00:36:59.710
Most observers know that since the
early 1990s there have been a lot

00:36:59.710 --> 00:37:01.960
of changes afoot in North Korea.

00:37:01.960 --> 00:37:06.040
Some of the indications of these
changes commentators often speak

00:37:06.040 --> 00:37:08.380
about, what population mobility.

00:37:08.380 --> 00:37:10.990
People are moving around
in lots of new ways.

00:37:10.990 --> 00:37:15.260
New forms of consumption, where
women's fashions are often talked

00:37:15.260 --> 00:37:17.630
about as are the new
style of apartments

00:37:17.630 --> 00:37:19.010
that are going up in city.

00:37:19.010 --> 00:37:21.600
There are many more, I just wanted
to highlight that the three areas

00:37:21.600 --> 00:37:24.670
that I sort of talked about in
this talk, are referred to today

00:37:24.670 --> 00:37:27.630
in order to track changes.

00:37:27.630 --> 00:37:32.370 position:56%
These changes are often read as
indicating a decline in the capacity

00:37:32.370 --> 00:37:34.640
of the state to rule
the country right.

00:37:34.640 --> 00:37:37.730
People are doing stuff that
the state doesn't want to.

00:37:37.730 --> 00:37:39.660
Some commentators go so far

00:37:39.660 --> 00:37:42.170
as to predict the imminent
collapse of North Korea.

00:37:42.170 --> 00:37:44.140
We know that going back
to the Clinton years

00:37:44.140 --> 00:37:47.970
at least this assumption
even shaped certain parts

00:37:47.970 --> 00:37:50.510
of American policy
towards the north.

00:37:50.510 --> 00:37:55.710 position:56%
Now as a historian, I'm not in the
business of making predictions other

00:37:55.710 --> 00:37:58.060
than knowing that if you
continue over decades

00:37:58.060 --> 00:38:01.050
to predict the collapse, you
eventually might be right.

00:38:01.050 --> 00:38:04.840
I can't help but notice that
these predictions of the demise

00:38:04.840 --> 00:38:08.310
of the North Korean state
often take as a background

00:38:08.310 --> 00:38:12.180
against which they measure these
changes the very cartoonish

00:38:12.180 --> 00:38:15.510
understanding of North Korean
history that have attempted to draw

00:38:15.510 --> 00:38:21.250
out that concentric totalitarian no
alternative historical agency type

00:38:21.250 --> 00:38:23.060
of history.

00:38:23.060 --> 00:38:26.380
Yet if you consider the history of
population movement and consumption

00:38:26.380 --> 00:38:27.970
to try to offer you today,

00:38:27.970 --> 00:38:31.850
we can see that there's always
been a much more complicated

00:38:31.850 --> 00:38:34.860 position:56%
and fluid history in the
relationship between the Kim family,

00:38:34.860 --> 00:38:39.080
the different segments and levels
of the state, and the population.

00:38:39.080 --> 00:38:43.460
If we escape the type of Cold War
era style histories of North Korea,

00:38:43.460 --> 00:38:45.630 position:56%
then the context of the many changes

00:38:45.630 --> 00:38:50.080
that are being remarked
upon today begins to shift.

00:38:50.080 --> 00:38:56.180
And so, the meaning of today's
changes also begins to shift.

00:38:56.180 --> 00:39:00.100
Always there have been limits
on state power in North Korea.

00:39:00.100 --> 00:39:04.290
The state has always had to
adjust to changes in social

00:39:04.290 --> 00:39:12.300
and economic forces, and one of
the virtues of this collection

00:39:12.300 --> 00:39:15.700
at the Library of Congress is that
it allows us actually to begin

00:39:15.700 --> 00:39:19.970
to try and explore some of these
other areas of historical agency.

00:39:19.970 --> 00:39:24.140
Some of the social, economic,
cultural, and gendered forces

00:39:24.140 --> 00:39:27.400
that shape the history
with which the party,

00:39:27.400 --> 00:39:31.500
with which the Kim family is
actually having to deal with.

00:39:31.500 --> 00:39:32.940
And I'll conclude my remarks there

00:39:32.940 --> 00:39:34.760
and I'd be happy to
take any questions.

00:39:34.760 --> 00:39:36.560
Thank you.

00:39:36.560 --> 00:39:42.590
[ Applause ]

00:39:42.590 --> 00:39:45.820
Yes, in the back there please?

00:39:45.820 --> 00:39:47.620
Could you tell me your name, maybe?

00:39:47.620 --> 00:40:39.640
[ Inaudible Audience Question ]

00:40:39.640 --> 00:40:41.500 position:56%
Right, it's a great question, right.

00:40:41.500 --> 00:40:43.540
Because especially in the '50s

00:40:43.540 --> 00:40:46.920
and the 1960s North
Korea sees itself firmly

00:40:46.920 --> 00:40:48.820
within a socialist word.

00:40:48.820 --> 00:40:53.250
There is all sorts of circulations
of movies and magazines.

00:40:53.250 --> 00:40:55.140
North Koreans are participating

00:40:55.140 --> 00:40:58.140
in conferences throughout
the eastern bloc.

00:40:58.140 --> 00:41:02.320
And I think the trick to
answering your question is partly

00:41:02.320 --> 00:41:05.380
which eastern European, or which
other socialist country you're

00:41:05.380 --> 00:41:07.730
comparing with because
there's an enormous variety

00:41:07.730 --> 00:41:10.030
of these questions
within socialist blocks.

00:41:10.030 --> 00:41:16.110 position:56%
So, one place I would start would be
for example, the design of housing.

00:41:16.110 --> 00:41:22.910
So, one of the things we could
find in the library here is

00:41:22.910 --> 00:41:31.830 position:56%
that there are architecture journals
where we can see all the types

00:41:31.830 --> 00:41:39.770
of designs of apartments that are
being constructed in North Korea.

00:41:39.770 --> 00:41:47.670
And even all sorts of models that
were never actually constructed.

00:41:47.670 --> 00:41:56.640
We see that somebody, I don't think
there was a single decision made

00:41:56.640 --> 00:42:04.600
on this, but there is no
communal housing in North Korea.

00:42:04.600 --> 00:42:08.810
It's all designed for the
single nuclear family.

00:42:08.810 --> 00:42:11.540
It's two rooms, a kitchen,
a bathroom,

00:42:11.540 --> 00:42:15.690
and you can shut the
apartment door, right?

00:42:15.690 --> 00:42:27.310 position:56%
So, unlike in China, if that's our
comparison, it's right at this point

00:42:27.310 --> 00:42:31.770
in China of course that communal
housing is being developed.

00:42:31.770 --> 00:42:37.380
Very different from the
situation in North Korea.

00:42:37.380 --> 00:42:39.920
So, in China the assumption

00:42:39.920 --> 00:42:44.980
that this architecture design could
help breakdown, or weaken the bonds

00:42:44.980 --> 00:42:49.430
of the family because it's
considered to be the bastion

00:42:49.430 --> 00:42:54.480
of futile values or
Confucian values, right?

00:42:54.480 --> 00:42:58.680
In North Korea, and
I think it's partly

00:42:58.680 --> 00:43:03.580
because of the colonial experience
in North Korea, there is an attempt

00:43:03.580 --> 00:43:05.870
to use architecture to firm up
the nuclear family actually.

00:43:05.870 --> 00:43:07.250
If I were then to look at
the designs with what's going

00:43:07.250 --> 00:43:08.550
on in the Soviet Union
at this period,

00:43:08.550 --> 00:43:09.850
we know that Khrushchev
right at this moment is part

00:43:09.850 --> 00:43:11.540
of his anti-Stalinist drive is
actually using everyday life design

00:43:11.540 --> 00:43:12.840
and material comfort
as one of the ways

00:43:12.840 --> 00:43:14.450
of criticizing the Stalinist era
and opening up new possibilities

00:43:14.450 --> 00:43:15.750
for the Soviet population.

00:43:15.750 --> 00:43:17.050
What we see going on in North
Korea is more in tune with that.

00:43:17.050 --> 00:43:18.350
So, you see the circulation

00:43:18.350 --> 00:43:19.650
of housing designs,
or these exhibitions.

00:43:19.650 --> 00:43:20.950 position:56%
But, there's an important
distinction is that the Soviet Union

00:43:20.950 --> 00:43:22.250
in its cities it's much
wealthier than North Korea, right?

00:43:22.250 --> 00:43:23.550
So, in terms of the material
culture, the objects,

00:43:23.550 --> 00:43:24.850
I think there's no
comparison, and even less though

00:43:24.850 --> 00:43:26.150
with east Germany, right?

00:43:26.150 --> 00:43:27.450
so, you're right that it's
important to see North Korea

00:43:27.450 --> 00:43:28.750
in that broader socialist
world context.

00:43:28.750 --> 00:43:30.050
But we have to also be
careful that there's a lot

00:43:30.050 --> 00:43:31.350
of variety within that context.

00:43:31.350 --> 00:43:32.650
I've always been curious
what's going

00:43:32.650 --> 00:43:33.950
on in Cuba at this particular time.

00:43:33.950 --> 00:43:35.750
I don't know that but, yes?

00:43:35.750 --> 00:43:56.080
[ Inaudible Audience Question ]

00:43:56.080 --> 00:43:59.490
So, you know my sense is that there
aren't as many links with China

00:43:59.490 --> 00:44:03.760
as there are with the eastern bloc.

00:44:03.760 --> 00:44:09.060
Partly, you have to remember
that the North Koreans set

00:44:09.060 --> 00:44:13.270
up their country in 1945 four
years before the revolution, right?

00:44:13.270 --> 00:44:19.670
And so, there's actually this sense
that we got there first in a way.

00:44:19.670 --> 00:44:25.930 position:56%
Through the 1950s, so let me address
your question by maybe talking

00:44:25.930 --> 00:44:27.610
about fashion, women's fashion.

00:44:27.610 --> 00:44:31.700
My understanding of most of the
literature on the People's Republic

00:44:31.700 --> 00:44:37.150
of China is that scholars emphasize
how after the revolution there was

00:44:37.150 --> 00:44:42.580
that sort of de-feminization
of women in China,

00:44:42.580 --> 00:44:53.420
but for the most part dress
becomes more masculine orientation.

00:44:53.420 --> 00:44:59.130 position:56%
There's less emphasis on femininity.

00:44:59.130 --> 00:45:01.920
North Korea, that never happens.

00:45:01.920 --> 00:45:08.130
If anything, what happens
after the declaration

00:45:08.130 --> 00:45:13.360
of equality this would
have been 1946,

00:45:13.360 --> 00:45:18.190
North Korea is the first country
in Asia to declare the equality

00:45:18.190 --> 00:45:19.680
of the two genders, right?

00:45:19.680 --> 00:45:30.470
And while you have that druidical
influence, emphasis on equality,

00:45:30.470 --> 00:45:37.560
you've got all sorts of
other ways of speaking

00:45:37.560 --> 00:45:43.230
about femininity, naturalizing
femininity.

00:45:43.230 --> 00:45:47.380
So, in North Korea for
example, there's an emphasis

00:45:47.380 --> 00:45:48.680
on the way women speak,
speech is promoted,

00:45:48.680 --> 00:45:50.260
there are specific feminine ways
to speak, which is an important way

00:45:50.260 --> 00:45:51.730
of naturalizing gender
difference, which becomes important

00:45:51.730 --> 00:45:53.030 position:56%
for the segregation of labor, right?

00:45:53.030 --> 00:45:54.330
There's all sorts of complications

00:45:54.330 --> 00:45:55.630
when we begin naturalizing
that distinction.

00:45:55.630 --> 00:45:56.930
So, unlike with China the issue

00:45:56.930 --> 00:45:58.230
with the way femininity
is being promoted,

00:45:58.230 --> 00:45:59.530
actually becomes very important

00:45:59.530 --> 00:46:00.830
for understanding the
way the economy works,

00:46:00.830 --> 00:46:02.130
and understanding actually
political power.

00:46:02.130 --> 00:46:03.430 position:56%
I don't think you can understand the
direction of the personality goes

00:46:03.430 --> 00:46:04.730 position:56%
without understanding some of these
fundamental assumptions about gender

00:46:04.730 --> 00:46:06.030
that developed in the 1950s.

00:46:06.030 --> 00:46:07.330
My understanding is that that's
very different from what goes

00:46:07.330 --> 00:46:09.630
on in China at that time.

00:46:14.820 --> 00:46:18.010
Any other questions?

00:46:18.010 --> 00:46:19.810
Yes sir?

00:46:19.810 --> 00:46:30.740
[ Inaudible Audience Question ]

00:46:30.740 --> 00:46:32.820
That's the hardest,
single hardest thing

00:46:32.820 --> 00:46:35.100
for me to try to get at, right?

00:46:35.100 --> 00:46:39.350 position:56%
Because you're getting through a
style of rhetoric that is influenced

00:46:39.350 --> 00:46:46.050
by the party, and you know there's
this upbeat, we're all happy type

00:46:46.050 --> 00:46:50.510
of rhetoric which we know
is produced by the party.

00:46:50.510 --> 00:46:56.430
And you can't really write
outside of that, right?

00:46:56.430 --> 00:46:59.920
So, if you want to
grumble, you have to do it

00:46:59.920 --> 00:47:01.470
in very careful ways in the press.

00:47:01.470 --> 00:47:04.690
You certainly can't do it
in the high-level press.

00:47:04.690 --> 00:47:06.890
So, everybody knows
the [inaudible] right?

00:47:06.890 --> 00:47:14.140
You read that and the form of
rhetoric is really standardized,

00:47:14.140 --> 00:47:21.450
right, it's the political discourse
of political study sessions

00:47:21.450 --> 00:47:24.670
that everybody writes about.

00:47:24.670 --> 00:47:27.870
You shift your focus and you go

00:47:27.870 --> 00:47:32.420 position:56%
down to the newspaper called the
[inaudible] one character difference

00:47:32.420 --> 00:47:40.180
it's put out by one
of the workers' union.

00:47:40.180 --> 00:47:43.350
And the tone of writing
is completely different.

00:47:43.350 --> 00:47:48.850
The types of stories are
completely different.

00:47:48.850 --> 00:47:53.080
So, one of the pieces

00:47:53.080 --> 00:48:00.380
that fascinated me is there's
all these worker criticisms

00:48:00.380 --> 00:48:02.910
of each other, right?

00:48:02.910 --> 00:48:11.540
And here you get maybe not a sense

00:48:11.540 --> 00:48:17.500
of the mood toward
the regime, right?

00:48:17.500 --> 00:48:23.450
That's the type of thing that
you see kind of expressed

00:48:23.450 --> 00:48:30.190
in the opposition, but you get a
sense of the tumult of precarity,

00:48:30.190 --> 00:48:35.480
or tumultuousness of precarity.

00:48:35.480 --> 00:48:46.390
It's these types of materials where
you can read about street parties

00:48:46.390 --> 00:48:53.350
that get completely out of hand
because everybody's drunk, right?

00:48:53.350 --> 00:49:01.880
Somebody writes in a letter to
the editor and goes this isn't,

00:49:01.880 --> 00:49:06.410
you know proper communist morality.

00:49:06.410 --> 00:49:09.040
These people don't have a
proper education, right?

00:49:09.040 --> 00:49:14.610
The truth of it is there was
just this party on the street

00:49:14.610 --> 00:49:16.380
that work the guy up
and he's complaining,

00:49:16.380 --> 00:49:19.210
he's invoking the party's
rhetoric to complain

00:49:19.210 --> 00:49:22.550
about these workers, right?

00:49:22.550 --> 00:49:26.860
So, in that we get a sense
of the variety of life.

00:49:26.860 --> 00:49:30.650
We get a sense of a lot of the
social and economic problems.

00:49:30.650 --> 00:49:32.510 position:56%
So, I'll give you one other example,
I printed out in one of the slides,

00:49:32.510 --> 00:49:33.810
alcoholism is something
that's talked about, right?

00:49:33.810 --> 00:49:35.110
So, there's one of the first
factories opening coming

00:49:35.110 --> 00:49:36.410
on after the war that
Kim Jong beer factory.

00:49:36.410 --> 00:49:37.710
Okay, yet throughout the press,
right, there's all these complaints

00:49:37.710 --> 00:49:39.010
about workers coming
to work drunk, right?

00:49:39.010 --> 00:49:40.310
About spending too much money.

00:49:40.310 --> 00:49:41.610
And one of the, in fact one of
the ways that you can get a sense

00:49:41.610 --> 00:49:42.910
that the material standards
of living are going up,

00:49:42.910 --> 00:49:44.210
especially since we don't always
trust North Korean statistics,

00:49:44.210 --> 00:49:45.510
is you can see the
social commentary,

00:49:45.510 --> 00:49:46.810
bout workers in their dormitories.

00:49:46.810 --> 00:49:48.110
And there's all sorts of problems
with gambling and drinking.

00:49:48.110 --> 00:49:49.410
And the reason it's offered,

00:49:49.410 --> 00:49:50.710
right sort of the indirect
way of getting the question.

00:49:50.710 --> 00:49:52.010
The reason this is explained is

00:49:52.010 --> 00:49:53.310 position:56%
because workers have gotten too much
money and there's not enough pride.

00:49:53.310 --> 00:49:54.610 position:56%
But it's quite amazing, so basically
you know they're keeping busy

00:49:54.610 --> 00:49:55.910
by gambling and drinking because
they've got too much money.

00:49:55.910 --> 00:49:57.210
It's an interesting way of getting
at the material life question

00:49:57.210 --> 00:49:58.510
in the end from this period.

00:49:58.510 --> 00:49:59.810
So, it's you know these types

00:49:59.810 --> 00:50:01.110
of materials I think
give us a better sense

00:50:01.110 --> 00:50:02.410
of the complex social
relations at the time.

00:50:02.410 --> 00:50:03.710
At the very time that these workers
are talking, and giving us a sense

00:50:03.710 --> 00:50:05.010
of the rambunctiousness
on the streets, right,

00:50:05.010 --> 00:50:06.310
you read party history that
comes out just after this.

00:50:06.310 --> 00:50:16.320
And you know everything is about
the leader, and unity of the party,

00:50:16.320 --> 00:50:23.860 position:56%
the harmoniousness of the; that's
just not true, that's fantasy right?

00:50:23.860 --> 00:50:31.740
But those party histories
are being written in part

00:50:31.740 --> 00:50:36.770
because that's what
they're trying to promote.

00:50:36.770 --> 00:50:41.340
The history has to be
seen itself as a tool

00:50:41.340 --> 00:50:44.410
to promoting what doesn't exist.

00:50:44.410 --> 00:50:57.420
All right, and so these types
of materials give us a chance

00:50:57.420 --> 00:51:11.430
to not just read those top-level
materials, but get a sense

00:51:11.430 --> 00:51:15.500
of the messiness at this period.

00:51:15.500 --> 00:51:22.230
But I can't answer the
question, what is the mood

00:51:22.230 --> 00:51:32.440
of the population towards the
party or toward Kim LLsung.

00:51:32.440 --> 00:51:42.940
I will say that in the 1950s
and early 1960s, right?

00:51:42.940 --> 00:51:52.060
As much as we hear about Kim
LLsung in the headlines and stuff,

00:51:52.060 --> 00:51:58.940
again looking into the type
of understanding we have today

00:51:58.940 --> 00:52:08.230
of personality cult just
didn't exist then in the 1960s.

00:52:08.230 --> 00:52:11.120
So, while I'm up working
on that personality cult,

00:52:11.120 --> 00:52:18.980
we're actually missing is a very
careful history of how that looks

00:52:18.980 --> 00:52:23.720
in south and up, and
the unevenness of it.

00:52:23.720 --> 00:52:25.100
So, you can find, there's
some children's journals

00:52:25.100 --> 00:52:26.750
in the collections, by
about 1960 you can see

00:52:26.750 --> 00:52:28.050
that for some reason the children

00:52:28.050 --> 00:52:29.350
and the youth journals began
printing Kim LLsung's name

00:52:29.350 --> 00:52:30.650
in a bigger type.

00:52:30.650 --> 00:52:31.950 position:56%
Other newspapers and journals don't.

00:52:31.950 --> 00:52:33.250
Right? There's this unevenness.

00:52:33.250 --> 00:52:34.550
So, my question, I see that
again, it's not something I study,

00:52:34.550 --> 00:52:35.850
my question then is you
know some of these features

00:52:35.850 --> 00:52:37.150
of the personality cult that
we've come to know and expect.

00:52:37.150 --> 00:52:38.450
How did they develop, if
there's this type of unevenness

00:52:38.450 --> 00:52:39.750
between different media
outlets, it doesn't appear

00:52:39.750 --> 00:52:41.050
that it was a central order, that
said everybody shall now write

00:52:41.050 --> 00:52:42.350
with a bigger script for
Kim LLsung's name, right?

00:52:42.350 --> 00:52:43.650 position:56%
So, the question is are people then,
for their own political purposes

00:52:43.650 --> 00:52:44.950
at that time taking certain
initiatives to participate

00:52:44.950 --> 00:52:46.250
in what they see is
a political direction

00:52:46.250 --> 00:52:47.550 position:56%
that some people are pushing, right?

00:52:47.550 --> 00:52:48.850
I don't know what the answer is,
it's not what I've been studying

00:52:48.850 --> 00:52:50.150
in particular, but you can see
that that unevenness is something

00:52:50.150 --> 00:52:51.450
that needs to be talked about
in order to have a better sense

00:52:51.450 --> 00:52:52.750
of the complexities, even around
the rise of the personality cult.

00:52:52.750 --> 00:52:54.230
So, the way, if I were to go back
to this sort of argument I'm trying

00:52:54.230 --> 00:52:56.120 position:56%
to make in my talk is, I don't think
we can understand the personality

00:52:56.120 --> 00:52:57.500
without having a better
understanding of the diversity

00:52:57.500 --> 00:53:00.200
of social and cultural experience
in the 1950s and the 1960s

00:53:00.200 --> 00:53:01.500
because the personality
cult comes out of that

00:53:01.500 --> 00:53:02.800
and depends upon the
forms of discourse

00:53:02.800 --> 00:53:04.100
that existed in that period, right?

00:53:04.100 --> 00:53:06.400
So, by simply focusing on the
outcome, we miss out on a lot.

00:53:09.240 --> 00:53:12.510
Oh, sorry, can I ask here
there's another question, sorry.

00:53:12.510 --> 00:53:37.040
[ Inaudible Audience Question ]

00:53:37.040 --> 00:53:38.600
Sure. Sure.

00:53:38.600 --> 00:53:40.760
So, that's a huge issue,
thank you for asking it.

00:53:40.760 --> 00:53:44.480
And it even goes back to the
first question that I was asked,

00:53:44.480 --> 00:53:46.610
a different form of comparison.

00:53:46.610 --> 00:53:52.180 position:56%
So, you know South Korea's the other
North Korean's constantly you can't

00:53:52.180 --> 00:53:56.810
read a newspaper without reading
reportage about South Korea

00:53:56.810 --> 00:53:59.310
in the North Korean press.

00:53:59.310 --> 00:54:01.450
What's a little bit different
from the German example,

00:54:01.450 --> 00:54:04.840
which was raised earlier is
that, you know by the end

00:54:04.840 --> 00:54:08.700
of the 1950s you can
argue that urban areas

00:54:08.700 --> 00:54:11.520
in North Korea were
materially much better off

00:54:11.520 --> 00:54:14.580
than many people in South Korea.

00:54:14.580 --> 00:54:17.350
So, the housing that we see
being built is happening

00:54:17.350 --> 00:54:22.410
in North Korea before it
happens in South Korea, right?

00:54:22.410 --> 00:54:26.500
So, in the German case,
there's always this sense

00:54:26.500 --> 00:54:30.340
of East Germany not being
adequate enough and trying

00:54:30.340 --> 00:54:32.590
to catch up with the west, right?

00:54:32.590 --> 00:54:34.620
In North Korea, there's
not this sense of catching

00:54:34.620 --> 00:54:40.090
up with South Korea at all, if
anything there's this trumpeting,

00:54:40.090 --> 00:54:44.830
like these types of photographs

00:54:44.830 --> 00:54:52.030
from apartment buildings I
show are about our successes.

00:54:52.030 --> 00:54:58.580
And if I had wanted to
pursue this as a theme,

00:54:58.580 --> 00:55:01.180
I would have shown you
they have all sorts

00:55:01.180 --> 00:55:05.090
of newspaper articles
reprinted from South Korea.

00:55:05.090 --> 00:55:10.820
It's one of the big
surprises that I found out.

00:55:10.820 --> 00:55:21.720
So, in South Korea in the 1950s
and 1960s, there was actually sort

00:55:21.720 --> 00:55:27.920
of a conservative critique of
the South Korean government

00:55:27.920 --> 00:55:30.470
about the sort of disarray

00:55:30.470 --> 00:55:33.420
of creating morals in
South Korea, right?

00:55:33.420 --> 00:55:35.640
Comes from a conservative position.

00:55:35.640 --> 00:55:37.370
Ironically, that conservative
critique of South Korea in things

00:55:37.370 --> 00:55:38.670
like the [inaudible] and the
like, was used in North Korea,

00:55:38.670 --> 00:55:39.970
it gave North Korea fuel, right

00:55:39.970 --> 00:55:41.270
to criticize South Korea
in their own press.

00:55:41.270 --> 00:55:42.570
They quote stories from
the South Korean press.

00:55:42.570 --> 00:55:43.870
They use photographs from
the South Korean press.

00:55:43.870 --> 00:55:45.170 position:56%
They pay really close attention to
the media in South Korea in the sort

00:55:45.170 --> 00:55:46.470
of battle for legitimacy, you
could write and entire book just

00:55:46.470 --> 00:55:47.770
on the ways, the images
of South Korea are used

00:55:47.770 --> 00:55:49.070
in that type of competition.

00:55:49.070 --> 00:55:50.870
A little bit like what goes on
between PRC and Taiwan too, right?

00:55:50.870 --> 00:56:12.640
[ Inaudible Audience Question ]

00:56:12.640 --> 00:56:17.200 position:56%
Sure, so that would be typical of
South Korean arguments about Marxism

00:56:17.200 --> 00:56:21.750 position:56%
and being anti-national, right, it's
sort of a betrayal of the tradition,

00:56:21.750 --> 00:56:30.370
yet what's also forgotten is
that you look at the North Korean

00:56:30.370 --> 00:56:41.200
in 1950s and 1960s and their
historians are publishing all sorts

00:56:41.200 --> 00:56:48.350
of books about the length of
Korean history and they talk

00:56:48.350 --> 00:56:52.040
about Korean history in the ways

00:56:52.040 --> 00:56:59.090
that eventually South Korean
historians move towards.

00:56:59.090 --> 00:57:01.540
So, the emphasis on
[inaudible] and the north.

00:57:01.540 --> 00:57:09.550
Some of you know Korean history
know that there's a lot of talk

00:57:09.550 --> 00:57:10.850
about these [inaudible] right?

00:57:10.850 --> 00:57:14.870
In 1955 they're already
publishing one

00:57:14.870 --> 00:57:19.670
of the key scholars complete
works in North Korea,

00:57:19.670 --> 00:57:27.050
well before they're
available in South Korea.

00:57:27.050 --> 00:57:33.650
So, they're not making the
argument that we're better Koreans

00:57:33.650 --> 00:57:36.350
than the south so much in
terms of invoking history.

00:57:36.350 --> 00:57:38.020
They make that claim based on
economics and they make the claim

00:57:38.020 --> 00:57:39.670
on the continued American
military presence in South Korea,

00:57:39.670 --> 00:57:40.970 position:56%
which is a whole other issue, right?

00:57:40.970 --> 00:57:42.270
&gt;&gt; SONYA LEE: And we have
to close it and [inaudible].

00:57:42.270 --> 00:57:43.570
So, actually Dr. Andre Schmid will
be at the [inaudible] to lunch.

00:57:43.570 --> 00:57:44.870
And he'll be here until Thursday.

00:57:44.870 --> 00:57:46.170
So, you can ask more
questions and then come back

00:57:46.170 --> 00:57:47.470
to our reading room, yeah.

00:57:47.470 --> 00:57:48.770
Thank you for the sharing.

00:57:48.770 --> 00:57:50.070
[ Applause ]

00:57:50.070 --> 00:57:53.980
And then, actually we have a
display of North Korean materials

00:57:53.980 --> 00:57:57.260
at the reading room,
Dr. Schmid mentioned

00:57:57.260 --> 00:58:01.540
about stamped item,
the FDD, we have that.

00:58:01.540 --> 00:58:08.170 position:56%
And you can see the cartoon actually
showing 1955 North Korea was opposed

00:58:08.170 --> 00:58:09.960
the nuclear weapons.

00:58:09.960 --> 00:58:13.980
Yeah, it's in, I happen to find
this so you can check there.

00:58:13.980 --> 00:58:17.340
And then especially
check the display case

00:58:17.340 --> 00:58:22.320
because there is a really rare,
I'm not saying really old,

00:58:22.320 --> 00:58:29.610
but rare materials from before
or until the Korean War 1950.

00:58:29.610 --> 00:58:31.470 position:56%
It's kind of deteriorating material.

00:58:31.470 --> 00:58:32.990
That's why we have protect that.

00:58:32.990 --> 00:58:34.790
It's really valuable materials.

00:58:34.790 --> 00:58:36.400
So, you can check that.

00:58:36.400 --> 00:58:39.800
Thank you for coming all of that,
enjoy all of you in joining us.

00:58:39.800 --> 00:58:43.300
And it was a pleasure
to see all of you, okay.

00:58:43.300 --> 00:58:46.400
Bye.

00:58:46.400 --> 00:58:50.060
