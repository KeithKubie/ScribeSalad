00:00:00.530 --> 00:00:01.950
And the answer is 30% guanine.

00:00:01.950 --> 00:00:04.960
&gt;&gt; Now, the easiest way to figure out this answer would be to

00:00:04.960 --> 00:00:08.810
take our single strand of DNA and fill in the other side. Once

00:00:08.810 --> 00:00:11.260
we've filled in the other side, we want to count the number of

00:00:11.260 --> 00:00:14.940
guanines, or G's, that we see. Lamarn, how many guanines do you see?

00:00:14.940 --> 00:00:16.239
&gt;&gt; Six.

00:00:16.239 --> 00:00:21.790
&gt;&gt; Six, exactly. We have six G's. now we won introduce take the number 1in 6

00:00:21.790 --> 00:00:30.900
divider by the two number you seedemonstrate

00:00:30.900 --> 00:00:39.520
the 10 one side and 10 one other side in 6/20 is very preserved preserved

00:00:39.520 --> 00:00:43.340
the looking inside Let's put our question marks back where they were before, and

00:00:43.340 --> 00:00:46.700
just look at the first strand of 10 letters. Now you see here, we could

00:00:46.700 --> 00:00:48.200
just count the number of guanines, and

00:00:48.200 --> 00:00:50.000
how many guanines do you see here, Lauren?

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:50.570
&gt;&gt; 2.

00:00:50.570 --> 00:00:53.780
&gt;&gt; 2. 2 guanines total out of, well, how many

00:00:53.780 --> 00:00:56.140
letters? Well we could just look at the one strand, 10

00:00:56.140 --> 00:00:59.130
letters. And 2 out of 10 is only 20%. And we know that's not

00:00:59.130 --> 00:01:03.070
right, because Lauren already told us the answer's 30%. But we can't just add

00:01:03.070 --> 00:01:05.790
the other strand, because that would be 20 letters, and 2 out of 20

00:01:05.790 --> 00:01:10.050
is only 10%. So we need some more information. What else are we missing here?

00:01:10.050 --> 00:01:13.500
&gt;&gt; Well, could we use the pairs of cytosine and

00:01:13.500 --> 00:01:17.000
guanine? Because you said that Gs and Cs pair together, right?

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:18.320
&gt;&gt; Exactly. So if you just look at our

00:01:18.320 --> 00:01:21.210
single strand here, we know everywhere there's a cytosine on

00:01:21.210 --> 00:01:24.660
this side, there's a guanine on the other side. So let's count the number

00:01:24.660 --> 00:01:28.230
of cytosines we see in our one strand here. How many cytosines are here, Lauren?

00:01:28.230 --> 00:01:28.980
&gt;&gt; Four.

00:01:28.980 --> 00:01:33.020
&gt;&gt; Four cytosines. So four cytosines means we have four guanines

00:01:33.020 --> 00:01:35.320
in the other side, and if we count the two guanines

00:01:35.320 --> 00:01:38.280
from this side, 2 plus 4 is 6, and 6 divided

00:01:38.280 --> 00:01:42.502
by the total number of letters which is 20 gives us 30%.

00:01:42.502 --> 00:01:43.084
&gt;&gt; 30%
