00:00:05.981 --> 00:00:09.090
Paco, like any good developer,
prefers to work

00:00:09.090 --> 00:00:10.453
on the application
on his own machine.

00:00:10.453 --> 00:00:12.618
This avoids synchronizing
database files and records

00:00:12.618 --> 00:00:14.486
with a remote server

00:00:14.486 --> 00:00:16.519
every time a change is made.

00:00:17.090 --> 00:00:20.816
LOCAL ADMINISTRATION PANEL

00:00:21.750 --> 00:00:24.354
Among some other tools
that we'll see

00:00:24.354 --> 00:00:25.552
in future lessons,

00:00:25.552 --> 00:00:28.189
the SDK includes
an administration panel,

00:00:28.189 --> 00:00:29.981
which makes Paco's work

00:00:29.981 --> 00:00:31.684
with his local
application easier.

00:00:31.684 --> 00:00:34.651
This panel allows him
to explore the information

00:00:34.651 --> 00:00:36.750
he adds as he advances
with the development,

00:00:36.750 --> 00:00:39.651
and it allows him to monitor
and control various components

00:00:39.651 --> 00:00:41.783
of the local
development environment.

00:00:41.783 --> 00:00:44.354
Paco can access
the administration panel

00:00:44.354 --> 00:00:48.189
by entering the address
localhost:8000 in his navigator

00:00:48.189 --> 00:00:51.420
after having launched
the development server.

00:00:51.618 --> 00:00:54.057
The first screen of the panel

00:00:54.057 --> 00:00:55.783
shows Paco
the number of instances

00:00:55.783 --> 00:00:57.486
locally serving his application.

00:00:57.486 --> 00:00:59.156
In this case, just one,

00:00:59.156 --> 00:01:01.585
in addition to some statistics
that said instance

00:01:01.585 --> 00:01:03.255
has served until now.

00:01:03.255 --> 00:01:05.519
If Paco, on another tab
of his navigator,

00:01:05.519 --> 00:01:06.981
now loads his application,

00:01:06.981 --> 00:01:08.849
he will see that
the number of applications

00:01:08.849 --> 00:01:10.585
attended to by the instance
increases.

00:01:10.585 --> 00:01:13.156
On the left is
the navigation panel menu,

00:01:13.156 --> 00:01:14.618
through which
the different tools offered

00:01:14.618 --> 00:01:16.783
can be accessed.

00:01:16.783 --> 00:01:19.519
For example, from the
Datastore Viewer section,

00:01:19.519 --> 00:01:22.156
quick data consults can be made

00:01:22.156 --> 00:01:25.024
and thus, the records
saved on his local application

00:01:25.024 --> 00:01:26.420
can been seen
in a pleasing format.

00:01:26.420 --> 00:01:29.420
He will have the chance
to create, modify and eliminate

00:01:29.420 --> 00:01:31.717
records without having
to write additional code.

00:01:31.717 --> 00:01:33.948
From the Datastore Indexes
section he will be able to see

00:01:33.948 --> 00:01:35.816
additional information
for his records,

00:01:35.816 --> 00:01:37.816
such as, for example,
the amount of space used

00:01:37.816 --> 00:01:40.057
by the indexes created.

00:01:40.057 --> 00:01:42.453
The panel also has
an interactive console,

00:01:42.453 --> 00:01:44.288
with which Paco
can execute code

00:01:44.288 --> 00:01:47.420
in the language
corresponding to the SDK

00:01:47.420 --> 00:01:49.849
directly downloaded
to the development environment.

00:01:49.849 --> 00:01:52.255
With this interactive console,
he can obtain environment

00:01:52.255 --> 00:01:54.849
information quickly,
register testing information

00:01:54.849 --> 00:01:57.585
in Datastore
or test small fragments of code

00:01:57.585 --> 00:01:59.783
before including them
in his script.

00:02:00.024 --> 00:02:03.981
For example, to see the included
Python routes by SDK,

00:02:03.981 --> 00:02:07.024
Paco imports the SYS library,
and quickly prints it.

00:02:07.024 --> 00:02:09.222
He can also see other aspects
of the application,

00:02:09.222 --> 00:02:11.420
such as the App Engine
environment variables.

00:02:14.024 --> 00:02:16.684
Paco will use
the local administration panel

00:02:16.684 --> 00:02:19.123
to help him in many ways
while he develops

00:02:19.123 --> 00:02:20.717
the census application.

00:02:20.717 --> 00:02:22.816
This will be even more useful

00:02:22.816 --> 00:02:25.684
when he has some test results
registered in the Datastore,

00:02:25.684 --> 00:02:28.057
Memcache, or uses task sequences

00:02:28.057 --> 00:02:31.090
to implement different parts
of his application.

00:02:31.090 --> 00:02:33.453
For now, try to take a look

00:02:33.453 --> 00:02:35.651
at the different panel sections,

00:02:35.651 --> 00:02:38.783
and review how starting
the local development server

00:02:38.783 --> 00:02:42.090
will be a fundamental tool
in the following lessons.

00:02:42.090 --> 00:02:44.354
Until next time.
Keep programming.

00:02:45.255 --> 00:02:48.849
KEEP PROGRAMMING!
