00:00:07.160 --> 00:00:08.976
I've always collected baseball cards.

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:11.856
I first started playing baseball
when I was eight years old,

00:00:11.880 --> 00:00:14.776
and when my hometown,
Red Sox won the World Series in 2004,

00:00:14.800 --> 00:00:16.496
I began meeting many of the players

00:00:16.520 --> 00:00:18.776
at autograph signings
and events around Boston.

00:00:18.800 --> 00:00:20.616
But I noticed a few things in common.

00:00:20.640 --> 00:00:23.696
These players weren't very friendly,
they were all quite overpaid

00:00:23.720 --> 00:00:25.536
and they acted more like celebrities.

00:00:25.560 --> 00:00:29.136
In middle school, a friend introduced me
to a new way to collect autographs:

00:00:29.160 --> 00:00:30.976
writing the players through the mail.

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:34.576
In doing so, I would write a letter,
send a self-addressed stamped envelope,

00:00:34.600 --> 00:00:36.056
and send a few baseball cards.

00:00:36.080 --> 00:00:38.216
Within a few weeks,
I'd often get a response.

00:00:38.240 --> 00:00:40.936
But it was never the modern players
that would send back.

00:00:40.960 --> 00:00:43.176
It was always the players
from the 50s and 60s,

00:00:43.200 --> 00:00:44.416
who were much friendlier,

00:00:44.440 --> 00:00:46.576
and much less recognized
during their career.

00:00:46.600 --> 00:00:49.576
So, I continued to write letters
to these retired ball players,

00:00:49.600 --> 00:00:52.936
and in 2007, Topps Baseball Cards
came out with a set

00:00:52.960 --> 00:00:55.856
where they included
a few Negro league baseball player cards.

00:00:55.880 --> 00:00:59.536
Negro league was a period
from 1920 to the 1960s

00:00:59.560 --> 00:01:02.696
where blacks who were segregated
from playing in the Major Leagues

00:01:02.720 --> 00:01:04.456
played in their own baseball league,

00:01:04.480 --> 00:01:07.616
often busing around the country,
playing two to three games a day,

00:01:07.640 --> 00:01:09.536
under much less glamorous conditions.

00:01:09.560 --> 00:01:11.736
But over time,

00:01:11.760 --> 00:01:14.856
due to the lack of glamorization
and public interest,

00:01:14.880 --> 00:01:16.576
everything just kind of faded away,

00:01:16.600 --> 00:01:18.856
leaving the history
of the Negro leagues behind.

00:01:18.880 --> 00:01:21.536
So, I ended up writing
to these players in this set

00:01:21.560 --> 00:01:23.896
and within a few weeks,
they signed my cards.

00:01:23.920 --> 00:01:26.016
From here, I began writing
to Negro leaguers

00:01:26.040 --> 00:01:27.736
who didn't have baseball cards.

00:01:27.760 --> 00:01:29.976
Guys that were, you know,
even less recognized.

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:32.616
And in my letters,
I'd often include my phone number,

00:01:32.640 --> 00:01:34.696
and a few of them
began reaching out to me.

00:01:34.720 --> 00:01:36.376
When I started speaking with them,

00:01:36.400 --> 00:01:38.576
I noticed they all had
a few things in common.

00:01:38.600 --> 00:01:41.816
None of them had baseball cards,
none of them had any documentation,

00:01:41.840 --> 00:01:44.816
no newspaper articles,
no sorts of photos from their career,

00:01:44.840 --> 00:01:46.896
just nothing tying them to the game.

00:01:46.920 --> 00:01:49.656
And lastly, they had just left
all their teammates behind.

00:01:49.680 --> 00:01:52.336
They hadn't stayed in touch
with any of their teammates.

00:01:52.360 --> 00:01:53.696
So, I tried to change this,

00:01:53.720 --> 00:01:56.776
and I started off by making
baseball cards on my home computer.

00:01:56.800 --> 00:01:59.976
Printing them out, designing them
and sending them to ball players.

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:04.896
And what I also did is I began
signing up for newspaper archive websites

00:02:04.920 --> 00:02:07.216
where I'd find old newspaper articles

00:02:07.240 --> 00:02:11.096
that would give these guys the recognition
that, you know, tied them to the game.

00:02:11.120 --> 00:02:15.176
And lastly, I began becoming
kind of like a private investigator,

00:02:15.200 --> 00:02:16.936
tracking down their former teammates

00:02:16.960 --> 00:02:18.976
and trying to get these guys
back in touch.

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:24.576
From here, I went on
and I just spoke to these players.

00:02:24.600 --> 00:02:27.536
It got to the point where I actually
had players calling me up,

00:02:27.560 --> 00:02:29.256
asking me for information.

00:02:29.280 --> 00:02:31.536
And by the time
I was a freshman in high school,

00:02:31.560 --> 00:02:33.216
it was no longer a hobby at all.

00:02:33.240 --> 00:02:37.296
I had gone from an autograph collector
to this Negro league research obsession.

00:02:37.320 --> 00:02:40.696
I even asked for Negro league autographs
and stamps for Christmas.

00:02:40.720 --> 00:02:42.336
So, going on through high school,

00:02:42.360 --> 00:02:46.256
I began to take this work
in the Negro league much more seriously.

00:02:46.280 --> 00:02:48.776
I started working
with adult Negro league researchers

00:02:48.800 --> 00:02:51.176
where I began working
on a few different programs.

00:02:51.200 --> 00:02:53.816
The first being
the Negro League Annual Reunion

00:02:53.840 --> 00:02:55.456
in Birmingham, Alabama.

00:02:55.480 --> 00:02:59.216
At the reunion, we'd have
about 50 to 60 Negro league ball players

00:02:59.240 --> 00:03:00.576
from around the country,

00:03:00.600 --> 00:03:02.056
and they'd all come together,

00:03:02.080 --> 00:03:05.856
and these players would just,
you know, sit in the hotel lobby for me

00:03:05.880 --> 00:03:07.936
from 8am until the late hours of the night

00:03:07.960 --> 00:03:10.176
just catching up, telling stories,

00:03:10.200 --> 00:03:12.416
and here we just had a week of events

00:03:12.440 --> 00:03:15.176
and these guys got some
of this recognition and honor

00:03:15.200 --> 00:03:17.776
that they never really had before.

00:03:17.800 --> 00:03:23.016
The second program that I began working on
was the Negro League Pension Program.

00:03:23.040 --> 00:03:27.496
And the Pension Program was a program
that was offered by Major League Baseball,

00:03:27.520 --> 00:03:29.936
and if you played four years
in the Negro league,

00:03:29.960 --> 00:03:31.536
and you can document it,

00:03:31.560 --> 00:03:35.640
these players would be entitled
to 10,000 dollars a year.

00:03:36.280 --> 00:03:37.976
This meant a lot for these players.

00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:40.656
Many of these guys
never really did much after baseball,

00:03:40.680 --> 00:03:42.056
they didn't make much money.

00:03:42.080 --> 00:03:44.456
So, when I was able
to get these players pensions,

00:03:44.480 --> 00:03:45.856
it really made a difference.

00:03:45.880 --> 00:03:49.256
When I started doing this,
I encountered a lot of difficulty.

00:03:49.280 --> 00:03:52.256
I had to go through hundreds and hundreds
of newspaper articles

00:03:52.280 --> 00:03:54.936
trying to find this documentation
to prove they played,

00:03:54.960 --> 00:03:56.656
and in many cases I did.

00:03:56.680 --> 00:03:58.336
Also I want to mention,

00:03:58.360 --> 00:04:00.816
when I was speaking
with these players on the phone,

00:04:00.840 --> 00:04:02.840
tracking them down, it wasn't easy either.

00:04:02.864 --> 00:04:04.736
I would go through hundreds of articles

00:04:04.760 --> 00:04:06.816
trying to look for names,
find information,

00:04:06.840 --> 00:04:09.416
and I encountered quite a lot of failure.

00:04:09.440 --> 00:04:11.936
I would call people up,
it would be the wrong person.

00:04:11.960 --> 00:04:13.296
It would be really awkward.

00:04:13.320 --> 00:04:15.936
I'd also have a lot of times
where I'd call players up,

00:04:15.960 --> 00:04:17.976
and they didn't want
to speak at all to me.

00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:19.216
They would hang up.

00:04:19.240 --> 00:04:22.696
When I said the word baseball,
they would just refuse to talk altogether.

00:04:22.720 --> 00:04:26.056
This was because they faced
a lot of segregation during their careers.

00:04:26.080 --> 00:04:28.576
Along with the lack
of glamorization that they faced,

00:04:28.600 --> 00:04:31.800
they also dealt with a lot of racism
on and off the baseball field,

00:04:31.840 --> 00:04:34.536
which just lasted with them
throughout their whole lives.

00:04:34.560 --> 00:04:35.776
These guys, you know,

00:04:35.800 --> 00:04:38.336
it was very emotional for them
to talk about baseball,

00:04:38.360 --> 00:04:42.496
and it was really hard
to kind of get these guys back, you know,

00:04:42.520 --> 00:04:45.576
talking about this game
that they had kind of left behind.

00:04:45.600 --> 00:04:49.376
Lastly though, I encountered, you know,
quite a lot of success as well.

00:04:49.400 --> 00:04:52.816
Some of these guys I'd call up,
I'd talk to them for two to three hours,

00:04:52.840 --> 00:04:55.616
and these guys would just
go on and on about their stories,

00:04:55.640 --> 00:04:59.216
telling me, like, exact baseball games
and memories that they had.

00:04:59.240 --> 00:05:02.856
Nowadays, I've attended
four Negro League Reunions,

00:05:02.880 --> 00:05:06.472
three of which I've actually roomed
with former Negro league ball player

00:05:06.522 --> 00:05:10.176
Russell "Crazy Legs" Patterson
of the Indianapolis Clowns.

00:05:10.200 --> 00:05:13.056
He actually snores at night,
in case you all were wondering.

00:05:13.080 --> 00:05:15.016
I've worked on about a dozen pensions

00:05:15.040 --> 00:05:18.016
and I've tracked down over a hundred
Negro league ball players,

00:05:18.040 --> 00:05:19.776
constantly finding new ball players,

00:05:19.800 --> 00:05:22.176
getting them in touch
with their former teammates,

00:05:22.200 --> 00:05:24.456
bringing baseball back
into these players' lives

00:05:24.480 --> 00:05:26.520
and bringing these guys
back into the game.

00:05:27.280 --> 00:05:29.840
(Music)

00:05:42.320 --> 00:05:43.616
Thank you!

00:05:43.640 --> 00:05:45.200
(Applause)
