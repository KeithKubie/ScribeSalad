hi I'm Nick butcher and engineer on the

00:00:07.760 --> 00:00:07.770
hi I'm Nick butcher and engineer on the
 

00:00:07.770 --> 00:00:09.740
hi I'm Nick butcher and engineer on the
Android developer relations team and I'm

00:00:09.740 --> 00:00:09.750
Android developer relations team and I'm
 

00:00:09.750 --> 00:00:11.419
Android developer relations team and I'm
going to show you a quick trick for your

00:00:11.419 --> 00:00:11.429
going to show you a quick trick for your
 

00:00:11.429 --> 00:00:14.390
going to show you a quick trick for your
activity animations so by default when

00:00:14.390 --> 00:00:14.400
activity animations so by default when
 

00:00:14.400 --> 00:00:16.189
activity animations so by default when
you switch screens Android will show an

00:00:16.189 --> 00:00:16.199
you switch screens Android will show an
 

00:00:16.199 --> 00:00:18.560
you switch screens Android will show an
animation between those two screens a

00:00:18.560 --> 00:00:18.570
animation between those two screens a
 

00:00:18.570 --> 00:00:20.179
animation between those two screens a
slight variation on the standard

00:00:20.179 --> 00:00:20.189
slight variation on the standard
 

00:00:20.189 --> 00:00:22.279
slight variation on the standard
animation is using a grow up grow down

00:00:22.279 --> 00:00:22.289
animation is using a grow up grow down
 

00:00:22.289 --> 00:00:24.380
animation is using a grow up grow down
animation which helps you to retain some

00:00:24.380 --> 00:00:24.390
animation which helps you to retain some
 

00:00:24.390 --> 00:00:26.630
animation which helps you to retain some
context where the users come from you

00:00:26.630 --> 00:00:26.640
context where the users come from you
 

00:00:26.640 --> 00:00:27.769
context where the users come from you
might be familiar with this from the

00:00:27.769 --> 00:00:27.779
might be familiar with this from the
 

00:00:27.779 --> 00:00:29.870
might be familiar with this from the
recent animation but you can use it in

00:00:29.870 --> 00:00:29.880
recent animation but you can use it in
 

00:00:29.880 --> 00:00:32.420
recent animation but you can use it in
your own app so here for example I have

00:00:32.420 --> 00:00:32.430
your own app so here for example I have
 

00:00:32.430 --> 00:00:34.010
your own app so here for example I have
a grid layout and if I touch on one of

00:00:34.010 --> 00:00:34.020
a grid layout and if I touch on one of
 

00:00:34.020 --> 00:00:35.900
a grid layout and if I touch on one of
these tiles like this top right one

00:00:35.900 --> 00:00:35.910
these tiles like this top right one
 

00:00:35.910 --> 00:00:38.569
these tiles like this top right one
it'll grow up from where I touched and

00:00:38.569 --> 00:00:38.579
it'll grow up from where I touched and
 

00:00:38.579 --> 00:00:40.459
it'll grow up from where I touched and
if I go from around here it will grow

00:00:40.459 --> 00:00:40.469
if I go from around here it will grow
 

00:00:40.469 --> 00:00:42.430
if I go from around here it will grow
from there so it helps to retain context

00:00:42.430 --> 00:00:42.440
from there so it helps to retain context
 

00:00:42.440 --> 00:00:44.869
from there so it helps to retain context
I've slowed this animation down using

00:00:44.869 --> 00:00:44.879
I've slowed this animation down using
 

00:00:44.879 --> 00:00:47.270
I've slowed this animation down using
one of the tricks using warmer settings

00:00:47.270 --> 00:00:47.280
one of the tricks using warmer settings
 

00:00:47.280 --> 00:00:48.950
one of the tricks using warmer settings
and developer options called transition

00:00:48.950 --> 00:00:48.960
and developer options called transition
 

00:00:48.960 --> 00:00:50.630
and developer options called transition
animation scale just to demonstrate this

00:00:50.630 --> 00:00:50.640
animation scale just to demonstrate this
 

00:00:50.640 --> 00:00:53.049
animation scale just to demonstrate this
better if I turn that off and go back

00:00:53.049 --> 00:00:53.059
better if I turn that off and go back
 

00:00:53.059 --> 00:00:55.639
better if I turn that off and go back
you'll see it's pretty subtle but it

00:00:55.639 --> 00:00:55.649
you'll see it's pretty subtle but it
 

00:00:55.649 --> 00:00:57.290
you'll see it's pretty subtle but it
really does help remember where the user

00:00:57.290 --> 00:00:57.300
really does help remember where the user
 

00:00:57.300 --> 00:01:00.020
really does help remember where the user
came from best of all this is incredibly

00:01:00.020 --> 00:01:00.030
came from best of all this is incredibly
 

00:01:00.030 --> 00:01:02.689
came from best of all this is incredibly
easy for you to do in your code so here

00:01:02.689 --> 00:01:02.699
easy for you to do in your code so here
 

00:01:02.699 --> 00:01:05.660
easy for you to do in your code so here
we are I'm creating a bitmap to scale

00:01:05.660 --> 00:01:05.670
we are I'm creating a bitmap to scale
 

00:01:05.670 --> 00:01:07.520
we are I'm creating a bitmap to scale
from so here it's just a simple color

00:01:07.520 --> 00:01:07.530
from so here it's just a simple color
 

00:01:07.530 --> 00:01:10.310
from so here it's just a simple color
for my demo and then you just use the

00:01:10.310 --> 00:01:10.320
for my demo and then you just use the
 

00:01:10.320 --> 00:01:12.289
for my demo and then you just use the
static method on activity options to

00:01:12.289 --> 00:01:12.299
static method on activity options to
 

00:01:12.299 --> 00:01:15.590
static method on activity options to
call make scale-up animation and passing

00:01:15.590 --> 00:01:15.600
call make scale-up animation and passing
 

00:01:15.600 --> 00:01:16.999
call make scale-up animation and passing
it the view to scale from the bitmap

00:01:16.999 --> 00:01:17.009
it the view to scale from the bitmap
 

00:01:17.009 --> 00:01:19.370
it the view to scale from the bitmap
thumbnail to scale from and it will

00:01:19.370 --> 00:01:19.380
thumbnail to scale from and it will
 

00:01:19.380 --> 00:01:21.800
thumbnail to scale from and it will
return you a bundle you pass this bundle

00:01:21.800 --> 00:01:21.810
return you a bundle you pass this bundle
 

00:01:21.810 --> 00:01:24.410
return you a bundle you pass this bundle
to your call to start activity and this

00:01:24.410 --> 00:01:24.420
to your call to start activity and this
 

00:01:24.420 --> 00:01:25.940
to your call to start activity and this
will perform the animation for you

00:01:25.940 --> 00:01:25.950
will perform the animation for you
 

00:01:25.950 --> 00:01:28.640
will perform the animation for you
couldn't be easier one slight variation

00:01:28.640 --> 00:01:28.650
couldn't be easier one slight variation
 

00:01:28.650 --> 00:01:29.719
couldn't be easier one slight variation
or I should have commented out here you

00:01:29.719 --> 00:01:29.729
or I should have commented out here you
 

00:01:29.729 --> 00:01:32.330
or I should have commented out here you
can see in the code is to scale up just

00:01:32.330 --> 00:01:32.340
can see in the code is to scale up just
 

00:01:32.340 --> 00:01:34.100
can see in the code is to scale up just
from review without the thumbnail option

00:01:34.100 --> 00:01:34.110
from review without the thumbnail option
 

00:01:34.110 --> 00:01:35.359
from review without the thumbnail option
so if you don't have a thumbnail to

00:01:35.359 --> 00:01:35.369
so if you don't have a thumbnail to
 

00:01:35.369 --> 00:01:37.670
so if you don't have a thumbnail to
scale from this is a slightly different

00:01:37.670 --> 00:01:37.680
scale from this is a slightly different
 

00:01:37.680 --> 00:01:40.370
scale from this is a slightly different
you'll have to do a fade animation as

00:01:40.370 --> 00:01:40.380
you'll have to do a fade animation as
 

00:01:40.380 --> 00:01:42.380
you'll have to do a fade animation as
well as the grow animations you have a

00:01:42.380 --> 00:01:42.390
well as the grow animations you have a
 

00:01:42.390 --> 00:01:44.060
well as the grow animations you have a
slightly different effect but if you

00:01:44.060 --> 00:01:44.070
slightly different effect but if you
 

00:01:44.070 --> 00:01:45.530
slightly different effect but if you
don't have a thumbnail to scale from you

00:01:45.530 --> 00:01:45.540
don't have a thumbnail to scale from you
 

00:01:45.540 --> 00:01:49.130
don't have a thumbnail to scale from you
can use this thanks very much
