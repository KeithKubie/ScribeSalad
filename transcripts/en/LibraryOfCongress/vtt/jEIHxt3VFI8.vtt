00:00:00.780 --> 00:00:04.630
&gt;&gt; From the Library of
Congress in Washington, D.C.

00:00:19.250 --> 00:00:21.290
&gt;&gt; Edward Widner: Good
afternoon everyone.

00:00:21.290 --> 00:00:24.120
Welcome to LJ119.

00:00:24.120 --> 00:00:26.080
My name's Ted Widner.

00:00:26.080 --> 00:00:28.970
I'm the director of the
John W. Kluge Center.

00:00:28.970 --> 00:00:33.690
And if you grew up in New England
like I did, this time of year,

00:00:33.690 --> 00:00:37.450
April 19th -- specifically
the night of April 18th

00:00:37.450 --> 00:00:41.770
to 19th is the night some of
us remember as the outbreak

00:00:41.770 --> 00:00:47.310
of hostilities in 1775 and
switched to a military phase

00:00:47.310 --> 00:00:51.170
of the long conflict between
the colonies and Great Britain.

00:00:51.170 --> 00:00:56.690 position:56%
It's now sort of developed into
just a marathon and a lot of parties

00:00:56.690 --> 00:01:00.360
around Boston, and not too many
people remember the political

00:01:00.360 --> 00:01:03.310
circumstances of April 1775.

00:01:03.310 --> 00:01:05.090
But I can guarantee you, one person

00:01:05.090 --> 00:01:08.170
in this room knows
them very, very well.

00:01:08.170 --> 00:01:13.320
It's such a pleasure to introduce
to you T.H. Breen of Timothy Breen,

00:01:13.320 --> 00:01:15.820
who is the John Kluge
professor of American law

00:01:15.820 --> 00:01:18.910
and governance here
at the Kluge Center.

00:01:18.910 --> 00:01:21.620
He's also the William Smith
Mason Professor Emeritus

00:01:21.620 --> 00:01:23.990
at Northwestern University.

00:01:23.990 --> 00:01:28.770 position:56%
He's the James Marsh Professor at
large, at the University of Vermont,

00:01:28.770 --> 00:01:32.630
and that is -- that has to be the
greatest job anyone could ever have

00:01:32.630 --> 00:01:36.920
to be a Professor at Large and
that is what he's been for us.

00:01:36.920 --> 00:01:38.230
He's covered the waterfront.

00:01:38.230 --> 00:01:42.220
He's been inspiring presence
among us at our lunches

00:01:42.220 --> 00:01:45.150
and in the hallway,
striking up conversations.

00:01:45.150 --> 00:01:47.620
The Kluge Center has a lot of
different kinds of scholars

00:01:47.620 --> 00:01:49.290
in different disciplines

00:01:49.290 --> 00:01:54.990
and Timothy's been just a
wonderful addition to our mix.

00:01:54.990 --> 00:01:56.650
Many of you know his work already.

00:01:56.650 --> 00:01:58.420
Many of you are personal
friends of his,

00:01:58.420 --> 00:02:00.960
and it's delightful to
welcome you all here.

00:02:00.960 --> 00:02:06.030 position:56%
I can't possibly list his productive
output because it would take

00:02:06.030 --> 00:02:07.330
up most of the next hour.

00:02:07.330 --> 00:02:11.390
He's the author of
more than 60 articles.

00:02:11.390 --> 00:02:16.830
Many, many books, the most recent
one of which is a favorite of mine,

00:02:16.830 --> 00:02:20.650
<i>George Washington's Journey</i>
, which came out in 2014.

00:02:20.650 --> 00:02:23.170
In 2010, <i>American Insurgence </i>.

00:02:23.170 --> 00:02:26.410
In 2005, <i>The Marketplace
of Revolution:</i>

00:02:26.410 --> 00:02:28.710
<i>How Consumers Shaped
American Independence </i>.

00:02:28.710 --> 00:02:32.090
in 2003, <i>Colonia Americans
in an Atlantic World </i>.

00:02:32.090 --> 00:02:35.070
1985, <i>Tobacco Culture </i>.

00:02:35.070 --> 00:02:37.500
1980, <i>Puritan's and Adventurer's </i>.

00:02:37.500 --> 00:02:39.710
1970, <i>The Character
of a Good Rule </i>.

00:02:39.710 --> 00:02:44.060
And that's not even all of them,
and I'm already out of breath.

00:02:44.060 --> 00:02:47.130
In all this work he's
done political history,

00:02:47.130 --> 00:02:49.490
economic history, social history.

00:02:49.490 --> 00:02:51.770
He's written about
the Colonial north,

00:02:51.770 --> 00:02:53.420
he's written about
the Colonial south,

00:02:53.420 --> 00:02:55.590
he's written about everything.

00:02:55.590 --> 00:03:00.310
And it's just been a great
personal pleasure for me,

00:03:00.310 --> 00:03:01.970
as someone very interested
in this period,

00:03:01.970 --> 00:03:05.160
to spend these last
few months with him.

00:03:05.160 --> 00:03:08.270
I'm looking forward not
only to his talk today,

00:03:08.270 --> 00:03:12.330
but I'm really looking forward
to his review of the new Museum

00:03:12.330 --> 00:03:15.140
of the American Revolution that
opened in Philadelphia this week.

00:03:15.140 --> 00:03:18.050
He's covering it as a
journalist reviewing it

00:03:18.050 --> 00:03:19.360
for <i>The New York Review of Books </i>.

00:03:19.360 --> 00:03:23.370
And I think, thinking about it as
a journalist and as someone living

00:03:23.370 --> 00:03:28.130
in the present is part of the way
Timothy Breen thinks about events

00:03:28.130 --> 00:03:31.410
that we are still dealing
with on a daily basis.

00:03:31.410 --> 00:03:33.430
Its history, but it's
still effecting us

00:03:33.430 --> 00:03:35.260
and we have new institutions
springing

00:03:35.260 --> 00:03:36.900
up with new interpretations.

00:03:36.900 --> 00:03:41.040
And thank god he's here to make
sense out of it for the rest of us.

00:03:41.040 --> 00:03:46.510
So without further ado, please
welcome Timothy H. Breen.

00:03:46.510 --> 00:03:53.950
[ Applause ]

00:03:53.950 --> 00:03:59.650
&gt;&gt; Timothy Breen: Thank you Ted,
and all of his staff and helpers

00:03:59.650 --> 00:04:04.060
who have made the last four
months if nothing else,

00:04:04.060 --> 00:04:05.900
extraordinarily productive.

00:04:05.900 --> 00:04:10.990 position:56%
I mean, to work in the Library of
Congress means I even imagine a book

00:04:10.990 --> 00:04:12.860
and it's on my desk the next day.

00:04:12.860 --> 00:04:16.570
It's an incredible resource.

00:04:16.570 --> 00:04:20.460
And so it's coming to
the end, but my wife

00:04:20.460 --> 00:04:22.750 position:56%
and I have really enjoyed being here

00:04:22.750 --> 00:04:25.600
and I thank all of
you on this hot day.

00:04:25.600 --> 00:04:30.610 position:56%
I might say just in passing, the new
Museum of the American Revolution

00:04:30.610 --> 00:04:35.630
that opened yesterday in
Philadelphia is very good.

00:04:35.630 --> 00:04:37.810
I'm not going to trash
it in my article.

00:04:37.810 --> 00:04:39.110
I thought I would.

00:04:39.110 --> 00:04:41.480
I went there with that goal.

00:04:41.480 --> 00:04:50.500 position:56%
But progress and intelligence has
betrayed me, and I came away feeling

00:04:50.500 --> 00:04:54.970
that this is an important
contribution

00:04:54.970 --> 00:04:56.980
to our shared understanding

00:04:56.980 --> 00:05:01.340
of what the revolution
means for our country.

00:05:01.340 --> 00:05:05.600
I come 19th Century
Irish background.

00:05:05.600 --> 00:05:08.140 position:56%
Not part of the American Revolution,

00:05:08.140 --> 00:05:11.000
and yet the American
Revolution is all of our realm.

00:05:11.000 --> 00:05:15.050
I mean, it created our political
system for better or worse.

00:05:15.050 --> 00:05:17.170
I think better some days.

00:05:17.170 --> 00:05:19.450
But there you are.

00:05:19.450 --> 00:05:25.480
The -- my comments today
will be woven someway --

00:05:25.480 --> 00:05:28.430
I'm not quite clear, into a book

00:05:28.430 --> 00:05:31.880
that I'm writing, I
was researching here.

00:05:31.880 --> 00:05:37.460
And it's called <i>An Appeal to
Heaven </i>, which was the major slogan

00:05:37.460 --> 00:05:39.160
of the American revolutionaries,

00:05:39.160 --> 00:05:42.490
certainly in the first
-- 1775 and 6.

00:05:42.490 --> 00:05:46.880
So it's <i>An Appeal to Heaven:
The American Revolution </i>.

00:05:46.880 --> 00:05:51.820
And this book proposes to
address several questions.

00:05:51.820 --> 00:05:54.050
My paper today won't
address all of these,

00:05:54.050 --> 00:05:57.800
but I certainly will
entertain questions.

00:05:57.800 --> 00:06:03.360
One of the oldest questions is
still out there and that is,

00:06:03.360 --> 00:06:07.020
what was revolutionary about
the American Revolution?

00:06:07.020 --> 00:06:09.610
At the end of the day
that's still a problem.

00:06:09.610 --> 00:06:12.200
Second, how did ordinary people --

00:06:12.200 --> 00:06:15.020
men and women living in small
communities from Georgia

00:06:15.020 --> 00:06:17.700
to New Hampshire --
experience the revolution?

00:06:17.700 --> 00:06:22.380
Not as soldiers, but as members
of small communities sustaining

00:06:22.380 --> 00:06:26.840
and mobilizing, and re-mobilizing
a revolution that succeeded --

00:06:26.840 --> 00:06:30.390
in fact, the book will
argue that although most

00:06:30.390 --> 00:06:35.730
of our attention still is on
the great leaders of the time,

00:06:35.730 --> 00:06:37.720
and maybe on the battlefields --

00:06:37.720 --> 00:06:41.520
like NFL plays, you follow
the little marches around.

00:06:41.520 --> 00:06:42.820
It's all important.

00:06:42.820 --> 00:06:44.120
I'm not denigrating that.

00:06:44.120 --> 00:06:47.260
But if it hadn't been for small
towns that never saw the face

00:06:47.260 --> 00:06:52.610 position:56%
of war -- that sustained the
revolution -- we would not have won.

00:06:52.610 --> 00:06:55.700
I mean it was the people
who got behind the cause

00:06:55.700 --> 00:06:58.210
and keep the cause alive.

00:06:58.210 --> 00:07:05.010
And third, is a question
that developed in the course

00:07:05.010 --> 00:07:11.930 position:56%
of my research here, and that is how
did a war that generated such hate,

00:07:11.930 --> 00:07:16.160
such bitterness, a sense of
revenge, anger, domestic enemies --

00:07:16.160 --> 00:07:21.460
your neighbors could have killed
your family or destroyed your farm.

00:07:21.460 --> 00:07:25.170
There was hostility in the
land, and yet at the end

00:07:25.170 --> 00:07:30.080 position:56%
of the American Revolution it ended.

00:07:30.080 --> 00:07:32.700
Unlike almost every other
revolution we can think of,

00:07:32.700 --> 00:07:38.710
our revolution stopped and
there was not killing fields

00:07:38.710 --> 00:07:43.440
or massive sense of
revenge in the land.

00:07:43.440 --> 00:07:45.510
I think that's something
needs to be explained.

00:07:45.510 --> 00:07:50.720
Not in order to praise us as
an exceptional revolution,

00:07:50.720 --> 00:07:53.670
but as a problematic in
comparing our revolution

00:07:53.670 --> 00:07:57.970
with other revolutions
throughout the war.

00:07:57.970 --> 00:08:04.780
Like a good undergraduate teacher
I have a crude handout some

00:08:04.780 --> 00:08:07.620
of you have I hope.

00:08:07.620 --> 00:08:11.410
I always praise the crudity
of my handouts because I claim

00:08:11.410 --> 00:08:14.700
that it's more authentic --
its like more revolutionary.

00:08:14.700 --> 00:08:20.330
It was neat, you see, you
wouldn't -- it wouldn't be proper.

00:08:20.330 --> 00:08:25.130
So, at the start -- and let me just
read my comments as best I can,

00:08:25.130 --> 00:08:27.390
and welcome your questions.

00:08:27.390 --> 00:08:32.640 position:56%
Let me warn you in advance that
this is a very radical presentation,

00:08:32.640 --> 00:08:35.960
and if you want to leave now
or you're going to be offend --

00:08:35.960 --> 00:08:37.660
it's a triggering moment.

00:08:37.660 --> 00:08:41.860
Right? You're going to
hear some radical things.

00:08:41.860 --> 00:08:47.620
Rest assured, I'm not proposing
anything wildly conspiratorial

00:08:47.620 --> 00:08:51.160
such as that George Washington
was really a secret agent

00:08:51.160 --> 00:08:55.300
for the British Parliament or
that the founding fathers wanted

00:08:55.300 --> 00:08:59.100
to redistribute land and
property to the peasants

00:08:59.100 --> 00:09:02.100
in the name of worker equality.

00:09:02.100 --> 00:09:05.620
Rather drawing on the research
that I've been pursuing here

00:09:05.620 --> 00:09:08.330
at the center, thanks
to Ted and his friends,

00:09:08.330 --> 00:09:14.720
I want to interrogate closely
a revolutionary narrative

00:09:14.720 --> 00:09:16.880
that Americans -- all
of us I think --

00:09:16.880 --> 00:09:23.260
have been telling ourselves about
the nature of the nations origins.

00:09:23.260 --> 00:09:28.490
The process of reconsidering the
relationship between chronology

00:09:28.490 --> 00:09:32.550
and narrative, between
the assumptions about time

00:09:32.550 --> 00:09:37.360
and its effect on causality
raises for me at least, exciting,

00:09:37.360 --> 00:09:41.320
even radical new questions
about the fundamental character

00:09:41.320 --> 00:09:44.730
of the American Revolution.

00:09:44.730 --> 00:09:47.840
Now even to pose the question --

00:09:47.840 --> 00:09:50.310
as I have in the title
of the lecture --

00:09:50.310 --> 00:09:53.670
what time was the American
Revolution --

00:09:53.670 --> 00:09:56.290
may strike you as slightly perverse

00:09:56.290 --> 00:10:00.100
since in fact the temporal
boundaries of revolution

00:10:00.100 --> 00:10:03.560
from the initial colonial
grievances to the achievement

00:10:03.560 --> 00:10:07.430
of political stability under the
federal constitution have been well

00:10:07.430 --> 00:10:09.840 position:56%
established in the historical memory

00:10:09.840 --> 00:10:13.710
of the United States
for several centuries.

00:10:13.710 --> 00:10:17.320
But however persuasive
this narrative may be,

00:10:17.320 --> 00:10:23.360
recent and ongoing research
invites a thorough rethinking

00:10:23.360 --> 00:10:26.890
of the familiar account.

00:10:26.890 --> 00:10:30.350
Although some scholars
once traced the origins

00:10:30.350 --> 00:10:34.820
of the American Revolution
back to the dark forrest

00:10:34.820 --> 00:10:37.790
of ancient Germany --
they really did that.

00:10:37.790 --> 00:10:42.560
And others have insisted that the
American Revolution did not realize

00:10:42.560 --> 00:10:47.640
its full revolutionary potential
until the age of Jackson.

00:10:47.640 --> 00:10:50.780 position:56%
The story of our national origins --

00:10:50.780 --> 00:10:53.730
think of third grade
again in your life --

00:10:53.730 --> 00:11:00.920
most often begins with the
1760 coronation of George III

00:11:00.920 --> 00:11:05.750
and then step by step it traces
the growth of colonial unrest

00:11:05.750 --> 00:11:11.890
from resistance to the Stamp
Act, through the Boston Massacre,

00:11:11.890 --> 00:11:16.790
the Tea Party, the Battle of
Bunker Hill, and then the drafting

00:11:16.790 --> 00:11:19.450
of the Declaration of Independence.

00:11:19.450 --> 00:11:24.250
After this defining moment
in 1776, the standard litany

00:11:24.250 --> 00:11:30.080
of events loses some of its clarity
and many historians have leapt

00:11:30.080 --> 00:11:33.220
with interpretive grace
from the Declaration

00:11:33.220 --> 00:11:36.650
of Independence all the
way to the Constitution.

00:11:36.650 --> 00:11:40.910
I call this the lily pad or
the frog pond theory of leaping

00:11:40.910 --> 00:11:44.430
from one event to another event.

00:11:44.430 --> 00:11:48.740
Of course this traditional approach
of time and narrative works best

00:11:48.740 --> 00:11:52.190
with intellectual history
or the story of history

00:11:52.190 --> 00:11:56.280
of political thought, since the
development of abstract concepts

00:11:56.280 --> 00:12:01.460
such as virtue and liberty
often does not concern itself

00:12:01.460 --> 00:12:04.940
with the changes social
and political context

00:12:04.940 --> 00:12:07.770
of the events on the ground.

00:12:07.770 --> 00:12:12.410
To be sure, a revolutionary
narrative framed by the accession

00:12:12.410 --> 00:12:15.180
of George III and the ratification

00:12:15.180 --> 00:12:20.500
of the Constitution does possess
a kind of compelling logic.

00:12:20.500 --> 00:12:25.260
It allows us to navigate
a smooth interpretive path

00:12:25.260 --> 00:12:30.220
from national liberation
to political stability.

00:12:30.220 --> 00:12:34.640
This traditional periodization
however,

00:12:34.640 --> 00:12:37.410
raises a troublesome
interpretive challenge.

00:12:37.410 --> 00:12:42.980
The standard narratives
suggest be it implicitly a kind

00:12:42.980 --> 00:12:47.800
of inevitability of
celebratory chronicle

00:12:47.800 --> 00:12:52.800
of the American people marching
forward under the banner of liberty

00:12:52.800 --> 00:12:55.730
and rights to their
well deserved destiny

00:12:55.730 --> 00:12:58.620
as citizens of the New Republic.

00:12:58.620 --> 00:13:05.360
Not surprisingly, this complacent
story lends itself to organic,

00:13:05.360 --> 00:13:09.060
even providential metaphors.

00:13:09.060 --> 00:13:10.360
You know them.

00:13:10.360 --> 00:13:12.520
Children growing up and demanding

00:13:12.520 --> 00:13:16.100
that the mother country
treat them with respect.

00:13:16.100 --> 00:13:21.650 position:56%
Or colonies growing to maturity like
political plants until they flower

00:13:21.650 --> 00:13:25.220
in the form of political
independence.

00:13:25.220 --> 00:13:28.130
From these perspectives,
the temporal flow

00:13:28.130 --> 00:13:31.990
of crucial events acquires
a kind of causal aspect,

00:13:31.990 --> 00:13:36.370
becoming in the telling a
coherent teleological tale

00:13:36.370 --> 00:13:39.280 position:56%
in which one thing leads necessarily

00:13:39.280 --> 00:13:42.440
to another thing from
beginning to end.

00:13:42.440 --> 00:13:47.370 position:56%
The description of the nations
origins therefore often takes a kind

00:13:47.370 --> 00:13:50.140
of self-congratulatory tone.

00:13:50.140 --> 00:13:54.850
One grounded on the assumption
of American exceptionalism.

00:13:54.850 --> 00:13:58.310
A belief that our revolution,

00:13:58.310 --> 00:14:03.000
this revolution was
somehow different, special.

00:14:03.000 --> 00:14:04.300
Even unique.

00:14:04.300 --> 00:14:08.500
Unlike other revolutions that
have shaped the modern world.

00:14:08.500 --> 00:14:12.710
In this rendering there's
not much incentive to engage

00:14:12.710 --> 00:14:14.460
in a comparative analysis.

00:14:14.460 --> 00:14:17.990
In other words, to examine
whether the American revolutionary

00:14:17.990 --> 00:14:23.890
experience over time
paralleled in interesting ways

00:14:23.890 --> 00:14:27.270
that of other nations
throughout the world.

00:14:27.270 --> 00:14:29.080
The French Revolution.

00:14:29.080 --> 00:14:31.080
The Haitian Revolution.

00:14:31.080 --> 00:14:33.540
The Russian Revolution.

00:14:33.540 --> 00:14:37.500
What is at stake in
posing a question

00:14:37.500 --> 00:14:42.330
about revolutionary time therefore,
is the possibility, the invitation,

00:14:42.330 --> 00:14:46.830
the excitement of developing
a less teleological,

00:14:46.830 --> 00:14:52.650 position:56%
more coherent understanding of the
relationship between interpretation,

00:14:52.650 --> 00:14:57.230
periodization, and narrative.

00:14:57.230 --> 00:15:03.040
The alternative conceptualization
of revolutionary time that I want

00:15:03.040 --> 00:15:10.580
to advance here is that what
we now think of generally

00:15:10.580 --> 00:15:14.200
as the single essentially
monolithic block of time --

00:15:14.200 --> 00:15:19.620
a block of time roughly
from 1760 to 1788 --

00:15:19.620 --> 00:15:23.940
should in fact be three
discrete segments.

00:15:23.940 --> 00:15:28.360
Each demanding its own interpretive
standing in the flow of time.

00:15:28.360 --> 00:15:34.360 position:56%
I bring to bear evidence number one.

00:15:34.360 --> 00:15:36.080
You can look, you can follow.

00:15:36.080 --> 00:15:41.980
You see the block of
time and now through it.

00:15:41.980 --> 00:15:43.750
It'll be on the final exam.

00:15:43.750 --> 00:15:46.260
So pay attention.

00:15:54.580 --> 00:16:00.090
This revised perspective does
not start with the assumption

00:16:00.090 --> 00:16:04.290
that history is moving
towards a predestined goal

00:16:04.290 --> 00:16:08.340
such as greater democracy,
or more personal freedom,

00:16:08.340 --> 00:16:11.390
or a powerful American empire.

00:16:11.390 --> 00:16:14.630
Rather my argument
begins with the assertion

00:16:14.630 --> 00:16:18.040
that the period most often
associated with the run

00:16:18.040 --> 00:16:21.510
up to the revolution and the
Declaration of Independence --

00:16:21.510 --> 00:16:28.040
in other words, the period 1760 to
1773 -- was nothing of the sort.

00:16:28.040 --> 00:16:32.140
These years are more accurately
defined as a general crisis

00:16:32.140 --> 00:16:36.250
of imperial rule throughout
the Atlantic world.

00:16:36.250 --> 00:16:42.610
The relatively minor provincial
risings in the American colony --

00:16:42.610 --> 00:16:47.640 position:56%
the Stamp Act crisis, the Boston
Massacre, the destruction of the tea

00:16:47.640 --> 00:16:52.240
in Boston harbor, lets face
it, were really minor tremors

00:16:52.240 --> 00:16:57.630 position:56%
in an ongoing effort by an ambitious
imperial power to make sense

00:16:57.630 --> 00:17:01.550
of the unprecedented
challenge of governing peoples,

00:17:01.550 --> 00:17:05.820 position:56%
of different races, and of different
backgrounds, and of different places

00:17:05.820 --> 00:17:11.080
over a vast world in which
communication remained slow

00:17:11.080 --> 00:17:12.510
and unreliable.

00:17:12.510 --> 00:17:19.210
The second stage -- the second
new stage of this revised version

00:17:19.210 --> 00:17:25.730
of revolutionary time begins in
1774 with the military occupation

00:17:25.730 --> 00:17:30.130
of Boston and ends with
the Peace Treaty of 1783.

00:17:30.130 --> 00:17:36.840
A period during which a colonial
rebellion -- colonial rebellion --

00:17:36.840 --> 00:17:42.980
transformed itself into a genuine
political and social revolution.

00:17:42.980 --> 00:17:47.470
It involved the experience of
armed resistance, of large numbers

00:17:47.470 --> 00:17:51.620
of ordinary people suddenly
assuming meaningful authority

00:17:51.620 --> 00:17:54.910
for the first time in
communities throughout American,

00:17:54.910 --> 00:17:59.420
and of social relations that were
no longer defined by monarchy

00:17:59.420 --> 00:18:01.930
or aristocratic relationships.

00:18:01.930 --> 00:18:05.780
These developments
promoted a strong sense

00:18:05.780 --> 00:18:14.180
of republic equality among
white males that turned itself

00:18:14.180 --> 00:18:21.600 position:56%
into initial armed response against
monarchical authority and eventually

00:18:21.600 --> 00:18:29.260
into a revolution few people
wanted or anticipated in 1776.

00:18:29.260 --> 00:18:32.370
The third period -- again,
look at your chart --

00:18:32.370 --> 00:18:38.100
in this revised narrative is the
years following the end of the war.

00:18:38.100 --> 00:18:42.700
Did not lead inevitably
to the Constitution,

00:18:42.700 --> 00:18:44.650
the federal constitution.

00:18:44.650 --> 00:18:47.520
Divorce from the traditional
triumph discourse --

00:18:47.520 --> 00:18:52.920
of which we all know we should
see the period after 1770 --

00:18:52.920 --> 00:18:59.500
1783 as a post-revolutionary moment
in which ordinary people came

00:18:59.500 --> 00:19:05.140
to terms with life under an
experimental federal regime

00:19:05.140 --> 00:19:09.440
and as they did so,
they sought to reabsorb

00:19:09.440 --> 00:19:14.830
into an uncertain civil society
a large number of Americans

00:19:14.830 --> 00:19:19.010
who had recently sided
with Great Britain.

00:19:19.010 --> 00:19:24.680
To depict this decade of the
1780's as "the critical period" --

00:19:24.680 --> 00:19:27.880
that's what it's called
in most books --

00:19:27.880 --> 00:19:33.400
it focuses unwarranted attention on
elite fears of disorder and anarchy

00:19:33.400 --> 00:19:36.850
and by so doing, turns an explosion

00:19:36.850 --> 00:19:41.610
of entrepreneurial energy
among ordinary men and women

00:19:41.610 --> 00:19:46.360
into an alarming account of a
revolution betrayed at the moment

00:19:46.360 --> 00:19:48.960
of it's greatest success.

00:19:51.530 --> 00:20:00.960
So let me explain a little bit the
rationale for this new narrative.

00:20:00.960 --> 00:20:06.600
And Ted, do you have
a whip or something?

00:20:06.600 --> 00:20:09.640
A prod if I go.

00:20:09.640 --> 00:20:17.780
A radical recasting of
revolutionary chronology begins

00:20:17.780 --> 00:20:25.590
with a thorough reassessment
of the period before 1775.

00:20:25.590 --> 00:20:29.420
These years seem especially
vulnerable

00:20:29.420 --> 00:20:32.090
to teleological interpretation.

00:20:32.090 --> 00:20:36.920
One can easily understand
the temptation to anticipate

00:20:36.920 --> 00:20:41.780
in the years, the coming of
revolution and independence.

00:20:41.780 --> 00:20:46.270
Because we know -- we know what's
coming and it appear only fair

00:20:46.270 --> 00:20:53.550
from this perspective to depict
every event as a harbinger

00:20:53.550 --> 00:20:57.320
to the final break with
Great Britain, but even armed

00:20:57.320 --> 00:21:01.580
with the clarity of hindsight
there's no reason to conclude

00:21:01.580 --> 00:21:06.780
that local complaints about
imperial rule, even urban riots,

00:21:06.780 --> 00:21:13.460
even threats of organized
resistance amounted to any more

00:21:13.460 --> 00:21:19.070
than what they were, highly limited
protests that lost the potential

00:21:19.070 --> 00:21:22.720
for a large scale mobilization
within days or months

00:21:22.720 --> 00:21:24.740
of their initial occurrence.

00:21:24.740 --> 00:21:28.800
Such episodes hardly
represented a serious break

00:21:28.800 --> 00:21:30.470
with imperial authority.

00:21:30.470 --> 00:21:35.710
Throughout the 18th Century the
British showed remarkable ability

00:21:35.710 --> 00:21:41.530
to maintain order in
England, Scotland, Ireland.

00:21:41.530 --> 00:21:47.130 position:56%
The negotiations in this empire
usually involved a pragmatic mixture

00:21:47.130 --> 00:21:49.830
or carrots and sticks, and
at the end of the day even

00:21:49.830 --> 00:21:52.480
when lethal violence was employed,

00:21:52.480 --> 00:21:57.160
the narrative process successfully
re-channeled local anger.

00:21:57.160 --> 00:22:02.710 position:56%
For example, the bloody conclusion
of the Massacre at St. George Fields

00:22:02.710 --> 00:22:06.080
in London in a tense 1768.

00:22:06.080 --> 00:22:09.360
There were at least seven people
brought down by government troops.

00:22:09.360 --> 00:22:12.640
About the same as the
Boston Massacre.

00:22:12.640 --> 00:22:17.790
But this was not a sign that the
British people were conspiring

00:22:17.790 --> 00:22:20.520
to launch a revolution?

00:22:20.520 --> 00:22:23.440
Conditions in North American
colonies were not that .

00:22:23.440 --> 00:22:29.530
The Boston Massacre certainly did
not lead inevitably to Bunker Hill

00:22:29.530 --> 00:22:31.140
or the Declaration of Independence.

00:22:31.140 --> 00:22:36.300
Instead, the event introduced
three years of extraordinary peace.

00:22:36.300 --> 00:22:41.930
1770 to 1773 were the most
peaceful, consumer oriented years

00:22:41.930 --> 00:22:44.050
of the whole colonial period.

00:22:44.050 --> 00:22:49.020
And poor Sam Adams was in
utter despair in his ability

00:22:49.020 --> 00:22:52.160
to persuade the people that
they had legitimate grievances

00:22:52.160 --> 00:22:53.460
against the empire.

00:22:53.460 --> 00:23:00.390
No doubt, Parliament's
attempts during the 1760's

00:23:00.390 --> 00:23:06.410
to raise revenue -- stamps, sugar,
tea -- irritated the Americans,

00:23:06.410 --> 00:23:10.210
especially those that
lived in the port cities.

00:23:10.210 --> 00:23:15.550
But, the fact of the matter is
that those Boston agitators even

00:23:15.550 --> 00:23:20.400
at the height of the Stamp Act
crisis did not receive much support

00:23:20.400 --> 00:23:23.630
from the ordinary people
living in other parts

00:23:23.630 --> 00:23:26.590
of the British American colonies.

00:23:26.590 --> 00:23:29.030
Leaders of the colonial
assemblies wrote

00:23:29.030 --> 00:23:32.980
to other leaders of
colonial assemblies.

00:23:32.980 --> 00:23:36.630 position:56%
They talked about possible coercion,

00:23:36.630 --> 00:23:41.100
about making stamp collectors
resign, but that was about it.

00:23:41.100 --> 00:23:44.820
Even in Massachusetts town meetings

00:23:44.820 --> 00:23:47.850
in the countryside
showed little enthusiasm

00:23:47.850 --> 00:23:51.570
for an agenda of the
Boston radicals.

00:23:51.570 --> 00:23:55.030
And I can say I've gone through all
the town records and they're still

00:23:55.030 --> 00:23:57.740
in print of these towns
of Massachusetts,

00:23:57.740 --> 00:24:02.730
and outside of Boston there was a
big yawn about what those wackos

00:24:02.730 --> 00:24:07.020
in Boston were up to in 1765.

00:24:07.020 --> 00:24:13.780
So the ability to limit and control
occasional controversy is precisely

00:24:13.780 --> 00:24:16.630
what one would have
expected at the time.

00:24:16.630 --> 00:24:18.460
Even if there had been
no revolution.

00:24:18.460 --> 00:24:22.770
After all, the American colonists
viewed the victory over the French

00:24:22.770 --> 00:24:27.170
in the Seven Years War as
incontrovertible evidence

00:24:27.170 --> 00:24:30.470
of their American loyalty
to the empire.

00:24:30.470 --> 00:24:33.190
And by their own lives,
they were not full partners

00:24:33.190 --> 00:24:36.290
in a powerful expanding
imperial regime.

00:24:36.290 --> 00:24:39.910
In so much, as the Americans
experienced a growing sense

00:24:39.910 --> 00:24:45.730
of nationalism after the
war, the expressed it

00:24:45.730 --> 00:24:52.420
in almost a reflective emotional
attachment to Great Britain.

00:24:52.420 --> 00:24:57.160
Indeed, many historians call
this phenomena I think rightly,

00:24:57.160 --> 00:25:00.120
the sense of colonial nationalism.

00:25:00.120 --> 00:25:07.570
What then, you might say -- should
there be any critics out there --

00:25:07.570 --> 00:25:13.630
of the much quoted pamphlets
that drive the standard account

00:25:13.630 --> 00:25:17.530
of the American -- the
coming of the revolution?

00:25:17.530 --> 00:25:20.860
Surely like the prophets
of the Old Testament,

00:25:20.860 --> 00:25:23.600
they were preparing the way.

00:25:23.600 --> 00:25:27.330
But in fact, celebrated
writers such as John Adams

00:25:27.330 --> 00:25:33.070
and John Dickinson were not
harolds of an independent republic.

00:25:33.070 --> 00:25:38.850
The colonists who analyzed the
American grievances were members

00:25:38.850 --> 00:25:40.260
of a creole elite.

00:25:40.260 --> 00:25:45.170
In other words, a group of wealthy,
privileged, well-educated men

00:25:45.170 --> 00:25:51.040
who felt themselves marginalized
within the imperial structure.

00:25:51.040 --> 00:25:54.170
That was their problem.

00:25:54.170 --> 00:25:58.130
Not enough patronage
is going our way.

00:25:58.130 --> 00:26:00.780
What these ambitious
Americans wanted was --

00:26:00.780 --> 00:26:04.360
lets put it bluntly -- respect.

00:26:04.360 --> 00:26:08.200
To be accepted by the leading
British political figures

00:26:08.200 --> 00:26:10.960
as fully British and
not as lesser beings

00:26:10.960 --> 00:26:16.010
who inhabited the marshlands
of empire.

00:26:16.010 --> 00:26:21.580
George Washington sulked when he
was not given a proper commission

00:26:21.580 --> 00:26:23.240
in the British Army.

00:26:23.240 --> 00:26:26.550
John Adams looking to
make a political --

00:26:26.550 --> 00:26:30.380
or legal career in
Massachusetts complained bitterly

00:26:30.380 --> 00:26:35.220
that Hutchison's clan
got all the business,

00:26:35.220 --> 00:26:38.510
and he had not received
any imperial patronage.

00:26:38.510 --> 00:26:44.510
Protesting his imagined inferiority
in British eyes, Adams announced,

00:26:44.510 --> 00:26:50.630
I say we are as handsome
as English folks here

00:26:50.630 --> 00:26:53.520
and therefore should be free.

00:26:53.520 --> 00:26:54.880
James Otis agreed.

00:26:54.880 --> 00:26:57.970
Benjamin Franklin held out
in the hope of acceptance

00:26:57.970 --> 00:26:59.960
to the very eve of revolution.

00:26:59.960 --> 00:27:04.250
It was only when he was humiliated
during a public hearing in London

00:27:04.250 --> 00:27:09.560
that he finally decided that
Philadelphia was his home.

00:27:12.410 --> 00:27:15.640
Creole leaders were not
plotting revolution.

00:27:15.640 --> 00:27:20.220
They only wanted to be
accepted in the imperial club.

00:27:20.220 --> 00:27:22.760
Frances Bernard -- a royal governor

00:27:22.760 --> 00:27:25.000
of Massachusetts during
the 1760's --

00:27:25.000 --> 00:27:27.210
a very smart and misunderstood
man --

00:27:27.210 --> 00:27:32.520
understood how to accommodate
these upity colonials.

00:27:32.520 --> 00:27:36.530
And he advised the Earl
of Hillsborough in 1769

00:27:36.530 --> 00:27:41.540
that if Parliament would only
create a kind of upper house

00:27:41.540 --> 00:27:45.220
in each colony, a kind of
American House of Lords filled

00:27:45.220 --> 00:27:49.280
with wealthy Americans appointed
by the King, it would --

00:27:49.280 --> 00:27:53.670
and I quote Bernard -- go a
long way to remedy the disorders

00:27:53.670 --> 00:27:57.000
to which the government
of America is subject to.

00:27:57.000 --> 00:28:00.280
And he predicted --
I think correctly --

00:28:00.280 --> 00:28:04.130
that eager Americans would fall
all over themselves to have --

00:28:04.130 --> 00:28:09.040
and I quote again -- Barron
prefixed to their name.

00:28:09.040 --> 00:28:11.980
The beauty of the change
would be that in the addition

00:28:11.980 --> 00:28:17.630
of so many royal honors from the
new form of govern, it will assist

00:28:17.630 --> 00:28:24.020 position:56%
in the establishment of it by
engaging men who are ripe for honors

00:28:24.020 --> 00:28:26.660
to reconciling the
people to the system

00:28:26.660 --> 00:28:30.950
that introduces the new honors.

00:28:30.950 --> 00:28:33.470
Nothing came with the plan.

00:28:33.470 --> 00:28:38.330
Since in fact parliamentary leaders
did look at the Americans as well

00:28:38.330 --> 00:28:42.340
as the Irish, as well as the
Scots, as inferior subjects.

00:28:42.340 --> 00:28:45.530
That's true.

00:28:45.530 --> 00:28:50.820
But bias here threatened what
could have been a brilliant reform

00:28:50.820 --> 00:28:53.120
to save the empire.

00:28:55.030 --> 00:28:59.650
What once appeared as
simply the inevitable run

00:28:59.650 --> 00:29:01.690
up to the American
Revolution therefore takes

00:29:01.690 --> 00:29:05.470
on a very different
character when we view it

00:29:05.470 --> 00:29:09.650
as a crisis within the empire.

00:29:09.650 --> 00:29:12.430
Great Britain was not
alone in having troubles

00:29:12.430 --> 00:29:15.120
with demanding creole leaders.

00:29:15.120 --> 00:29:18.010
Throughout the new world
they demanded more authority.

00:29:18.010 --> 00:29:21.690
They demanded a meaningful
voice in the Atlantic economy.

00:29:21.690 --> 00:29:24.790
This was the moment when
the British, the French,

00:29:24.790 --> 00:29:28.160
and the Spanish discovered for the
first time that they were not fully

00:29:28.160 --> 00:29:32.480
in control of the lands and
the peoples of the new world

00:29:32.480 --> 00:29:35.290
that they claimed to rule.

00:29:35.290 --> 00:29:39.220
The new world remained
uncharted territory

00:29:39.220 --> 00:29:42.340
for these imperial administrators.

00:29:42.340 --> 00:29:48.040
And awareness of this demanding,
fluent, fluid experimental aspect

00:29:48.040 --> 00:29:53.450
of 18th Century expansion I think
erodes our standard revolutionary

00:29:53.450 --> 00:29:55.500
narrative and indeed it brings us

00:29:55.500 --> 00:30:03.390
into an unprecedented
imperial crisis.

00:30:03.390 --> 00:30:08.900
And reminds us that the
pre-revolutionary period was not

00:30:08.900 --> 00:30:11.660
pre-revolutionary at all.

00:30:11.660 --> 00:30:17.110
It was rather a period of sorting
out complex relations, races,

00:30:17.110 --> 00:30:21.800
distances, peoples
throughout a territory

00:30:21.800 --> 00:30:24.690
that amounted to half the globe.

00:30:28.170 --> 00:30:30.960
The second, even more
significant break

00:30:30.960 --> 00:30:34.760
in the standard revolutionary
time in 1774.

00:30:34.760 --> 00:30:36.530
This was a crucial year.

00:30:36.530 --> 00:30:41.690
This was the major year that
witnessed the rendering of time,

00:30:41.690 --> 00:30:46.730
rendering of the old narrative
we all learned in third grade.

00:30:46.730 --> 00:30:50.890
For although memories of an
earlier period shaped the political

00:30:50.890 --> 00:30:55.510
consensus of consciousness
of Americans the landscape

00:30:55.510 --> 00:31:00.100
of power underwent a
sudden and profound shift.

00:31:00.100 --> 00:31:05.460
And the trigger for massive change
was not the traditional story

00:31:05.460 --> 00:31:11.200
of the coming of the American
Revolution, the Boston Tea Party.

00:31:11.200 --> 00:31:13.440
It was not the Boston Tea Party.

00:31:13.440 --> 00:31:18.810
Many Americans saw the destruction
of the private property in Boston

00:31:18.810 --> 00:31:22.590
as an extreme and unpleasant
form of protest.

00:31:22.590 --> 00:31:24.980
As an unwarranted provocation.

00:31:24.980 --> 00:31:27.320
An attack on property.

00:31:27.320 --> 00:31:31.940
And there was in fact almost no
outpouring of popular support

00:31:31.940 --> 00:31:33.240
for the people of Boston

00:31:33.240 --> 00:31:35.690
who organized throwing
the tea into the water.

00:31:35.690 --> 00:31:43.660
What fundamentally and irrevocably
transformed the character

00:31:43.660 --> 00:31:48.090
of colonial politics was not
the destruction of the tea,

00:31:48.090 --> 00:31:52.590
but the reaction in Parliament
to the destruction of the tea.

00:31:52.590 --> 00:31:57.510
The story of protest by creole
leaders suddenly became a tale

00:31:57.510 --> 00:32:02.090
of massive popular mobilization.

00:32:02.090 --> 00:32:09.330
And so in 1774 we enter an entirely
new, unprecedented political world.

00:32:09.330 --> 00:32:12.160
Lord North and his
allies passed a series

00:32:12.160 --> 00:32:16.500
of harsh retaliatory acts
known as the Coercive Acts,

00:32:16.500 --> 00:32:20.440
which not only closed the Port
of Boston to all commerce,

00:32:20.440 --> 00:32:24.430
but more important -- and
I think we overlook --

00:32:24.430 --> 00:32:29.990 position:56%
authorized armed military occupation

00:32:29.990 --> 00:32:34.620
of the second largest
city in colonial America.

00:32:34.620 --> 00:32:38.590
I might say that the Brits had
never used armed occupation

00:32:38.590 --> 00:32:40.610
in their own cities under --

00:32:40.610 --> 00:32:46.270
this was a provocation of
great, great magnitude.

00:32:46.270 --> 00:32:48.860
And for the colonists
living is distant places

00:32:48.860 --> 00:32:51.260 position:56%
such as South Carolina and Virginia,

00:32:51.260 --> 00:32:55.210
the British punishments seemed
totally out of proportion

00:32:55.210 --> 00:32:57.990
with the seriousness of the crime.

00:32:57.990 --> 00:33:03.190
Over night, British -- over night
Boston became a city occupied

00:33:03.190 --> 00:33:08.620
by a standing army and it's
subjects subject to marshal law.

00:33:08.620 --> 00:33:15.930
And suddenly in that year, you find
Americans -- ordinary Americans,

00:33:15.930 --> 00:33:21.200 position:56%
men and women -- talking about
something called the American cause.

00:33:21.200 --> 00:33:26.710
A new phrase in the
lexicon of protest.

00:33:26.710 --> 00:33:31.590
The revisionary view
of revolutionary time

00:33:31.590 --> 00:33:37.090
that I'm proposing takes our
attention away from the writings

00:33:37.090 --> 00:33:39.340
of celebrated leaders, the ones --

00:33:39.340 --> 00:33:44.100
the pamphlets, the arguments
of lawyers and planters.

00:33:44.100 --> 00:33:50.070
My time restores the people who
actually showed up at Bunker Hill

00:33:50.070 --> 00:33:53.870
and figured out what revolution
meant in their lives without having

00:33:53.870 --> 00:33:57.520
to read the learned pamphlets
that figure so centrally

00:33:57.520 --> 00:33:59.970
in our intellectual history.

00:34:06.170 --> 00:34:11.400
One detail -- and I know there's
an Irishman way back there --

00:34:11.400 --> 00:34:16.770 position:56%
one detail I just want to give you
that shall we say, puts on the alert

00:34:16.770 --> 00:34:20.310
about the standard
teleological account, my research

00:34:20.310 --> 00:34:25.130 position:56%
and the research of other scholars
have shown there was a massive flood

00:34:25.130 --> 00:34:27.900
of Irish immigrants -- massive --

00:34:27.900 --> 00:34:32.900
in 1774, 75, into the
American colonies.

00:34:32.900 --> 00:34:37.110
They were driven out of Ireland
-- mostly in the North --

00:34:37.110 --> 00:34:42.020 position:56%
by British restrictions on the linen
industry that were very similar

00:34:42.020 --> 00:34:47.650
to the restrictions on
American stamps and so on.

00:34:47.650 --> 00:34:54.910
My point was, these Irishmen came
to America and had no experience

00:34:54.910 --> 00:34:58.930
or memory of the American
protest of the 1760's.

00:34:58.930 --> 00:35:02.520
They were irritated -- they
knew to hate Brits on their own.

00:35:02.520 --> 00:35:07.390
They didn't need the
American experience.

00:35:07.390 --> 00:35:09.070
So what does it matter?

00:35:09.070 --> 00:35:12.000
Research has found that in
some of the continental lines

00:35:12.000 --> 00:35:15.650 position:56%
in Pennsylvania especially, over 60%

00:35:15.650 --> 00:35:21.370
of all the fighting men
were new Irish immigrants.

00:35:21.370 --> 00:35:26.830
Hm-mm, so much for the teleological
argument about growing protests.

00:35:26.830 --> 00:35:32.470
It's the new men, angry
at the empire.

00:35:32.470 --> 00:35:36.950
Now 1775, these protests

00:35:36.950 --> 00:35:42.420
or this resistance did not signal
the start of a genuine revolution.

00:35:42.420 --> 00:35:43.720
That came later.

00:35:43.720 --> 00:35:46.930
At first, most American's
hoped that Lord North

00:35:46.930 --> 00:35:51.430
and his supporters would simply
come to their senses and find a way

00:35:51.430 --> 00:35:55.300
to negotiate a way
to save the empire.

00:35:55.300 --> 00:35:59.190
They wanted reform,
not independence.

00:35:59.190 --> 00:36:02.630
And there was little
-- almost no enthusiasm

00:36:02.630 --> 00:36:04.640
for Republican government.

00:36:04.640 --> 00:36:10.370
From this perspective almost
all Americans in 1776 --

00:36:10.370 --> 00:36:13.040
75 I would say -- were loyalists.

00:36:13.040 --> 00:36:14.340
All of them.

00:36:14.340 --> 00:36:16.930
They simply wanted the
British to back down

00:36:16.930 --> 00:36:20.530
and restore an imperial system
that would bring them security

00:36:20.530 --> 00:36:23.680
and respect within the empire.

00:36:23.680 --> 00:36:27.420
Thomas Jefferson noted in
something that you all should read,

00:36:27.420 --> 00:36:29.770
because its kind of
a weird document,

00:36:29.770 --> 00:36:34.630
and that is the first draft of
the Declaration of Independence.

00:36:34.630 --> 00:36:38.020
It's a testimony to good teaching.

00:36:38.020 --> 00:36:40.930
I mean, we all think
it's so well written,

00:36:40.930 --> 00:36:44.840
but it's took his colleagues
to cut the adverbs

00:36:44.840 --> 00:36:48.690
and the adjectives out
and make it pretty.

00:36:48.690 --> 00:36:57.170
What did he write at this moment
of the second period of time?

00:36:57.170 --> 00:37:04.010 position:56%
We might have been a free and great
people together, but a communication

00:37:04.010 --> 00:37:09.850
of grandeur and of freedom it
seems is below the British dignity.

00:37:09.850 --> 00:37:14.530
In so, so they will have
it so, the road to glory

00:37:14.530 --> 00:37:17.010
and happiness is open to us.

00:37:17.010 --> 00:37:21.410 position:56%
We will climb it as a separate
state and acquiesce in the necessity

00:37:21.410 --> 00:37:26.350
which pronounces us to say to
Britain, an everlasting ado.

00:37:26.350 --> 00:37:29.020
That got cut out.

00:37:29.020 --> 00:37:34.780
At the start of the war, therefore
the American insurgence clashed

00:37:34.780 --> 00:37:39.150
over strategies of
reconciliation and not

00:37:39.150 --> 00:37:42.260
over fundamental political ideas.

00:37:42.260 --> 00:37:45.590
Even colonial leaders who later
opposed independence [inaudible]

00:37:45.590 --> 00:37:51.740
at the beginning of resistance
values such as virtue and liberty.

00:37:51.740 --> 00:37:59.150
By 1776, our protest against the
British oppression had begun --

00:37:59.150 --> 00:38:04.490
that had begun as a colonial
rebellion comparative to India

00:38:04.490 --> 00:38:07.920
or Nigeria, or other
former colonial states.

00:38:07.920 --> 00:38:11.410
It had become a real revolution.

00:38:11.410 --> 00:38:14.260
The transformation did
not involve the shift

00:38:14.260 --> 00:38:16.980 position:56%
in fundamental political principles.

00:38:16.980 --> 00:38:21.490
Ideology did not turn
rebellion into revolution.

00:38:21.490 --> 00:38:25.950
After all, the idea that the people
are the only legitimate source

00:38:25.950 --> 00:38:30.200
of political power has a very
long history reaching back

00:38:30.200 --> 00:38:32.500
into the Middle Ages.

00:38:33.530 --> 00:38:39.030 position:56%
The new element in the time equation
was experienced quite simply

00:38:39.030 --> 00:38:42.370
by living through a time of
violent political change.

00:38:42.370 --> 00:38:45.900
It was one -- it's one thing
to discuss with your friends

00:38:45.900 --> 00:38:49.700
in the pub rights and equality in
the abstract, but quite another

00:38:49.700 --> 00:38:57.220
to experience newly formed groups,
army groups, committees of safety

00:38:57.220 --> 00:39:00.380
and inspection that recruited
people that had never served

00:39:00.380 --> 00:39:04.040
in any political movement at all.

00:39:04.040 --> 00:39:09.190
Participation in political
resistance created fresh and new

00:39:09.190 --> 00:39:13.940
and exciting emotional bonds
that carried radical potential.

00:39:13.940 --> 00:39:21.390 position:56%
White American males came to believe
in a crude sense their equality.

00:39:21.390 --> 00:39:25.210
Aristocratic claims to special
privilege no longer counted

00:39:25.210 --> 00:39:26.510
for much.

00:39:26.510 --> 00:39:31.560
Achievement through works
suddenly transcended the old order.

00:39:31.560 --> 00:39:35.420
That's revolutionary in
the late-18th Century.

00:39:36.930 --> 00:39:42.930
To be sure, the language of rights
inspired American revolutionaries.

00:39:42.930 --> 00:39:47.670
The traditional story of
revolution stresses the centrality

00:39:47.670 --> 00:39:52.390
of these enabling principles they
did yesterday in Philadelphia.

00:39:52.390 --> 00:39:55.770
But that approach discounts
other binding elements,

00:39:55.770 --> 00:39:58.610
some of which make
modern commentators

00:39:58.610 --> 00:40:03.270
on our revolution uncomfortable.

00:40:03.270 --> 00:40:11.280
The actual experience of war
included not only Republican ideas,

00:40:11.280 --> 00:40:17.810
but also a forgotten lexicon of
unsettled words such as fear,

00:40:17.810 --> 00:40:20.470
vengeance, retaliation,
denunciation,

00:40:20.470 --> 00:40:22.540
betrayal, revenge, and violence.

00:40:22.540 --> 00:40:26.570
That's part of our revolution too.

00:40:26.570 --> 00:40:31.420
It is this emotionally
charged political environment

00:40:31.420 --> 00:40:34.440
that has gone missing from
the historical literature,

00:40:34.440 --> 00:40:38.680
securing the revolution -- securing
our revolution was difficult

00:40:38.680 --> 00:40:41.490
and dangerous for all people.

00:40:41.490 --> 00:40:45.170
Suspicion of neighbors, enforcing
the revolutionary agenda,

00:40:45.170 --> 00:40:50.080
taking property from domestic
enemies, is often thought as a part

00:40:50.080 --> 00:40:53.410
of the story of other revolutions.

00:40:53.410 --> 00:40:56.000
Less nice, less good
revolutions than ours.

00:40:56.000 --> 00:41:02.660
But I can assure you it was a
nasty business those eight years.

00:41:02.660 --> 00:41:06.910
After the victory of Yorktown,
Americans entered the third

00:41:06.910 --> 00:41:11.840
and final, and blessedly
for you, short period.

00:41:11.840 --> 00:41:18.010
Which is best described I think
as our post-revolutionary period.

00:41:18.010 --> 00:41:23.350
This different terminology
post-revolutionary,

00:41:23.350 --> 00:41:29.210 position:56%
deflects our attention away from the
absolute obsession with the coming

00:41:29.210 --> 00:41:33.500
and the drafting of
the Constitution.

00:41:33.500 --> 00:41:38.020
George Washington, Andrew
Hamilton, James Madison,

00:41:38.020 --> 00:41:40.490
the dominant characters
in the campaign

00:41:40.490 --> 00:41:42.840
to establish a strong
central government --

00:41:42.840 --> 00:41:48.430
certainly they did worry about the
dangers of political fragmentation.

00:41:48.430 --> 00:41:53.200
They became so anxious about the
threat of stability that in fact

00:41:53.200 --> 00:41:59.710 position:56%
that they greatly exaggerated the
danger posed by small agrarian riots

00:41:59.710 --> 00:42:04.600
such as Daniel Shays -- a
group of impoverished veterans

00:42:04.600 --> 00:42:08.130
in Massachusetts that presents
absolutely no military threat

00:42:08.130 --> 00:42:11.680
to anybody, but it
became a national incident

00:42:11.680 --> 00:42:18.630
of great historical power
in our story of stealth.

00:42:18.630 --> 00:42:20.150
But however we may
admire [inaudible],

00:42:20.150 --> 00:42:25.720
we do not have to accept
this analysis.

00:42:25.720 --> 00:42:31.000
If one concentrates chiefly on
elite fears, on looming anarchy

00:42:31.000 --> 00:42:33.870
as most American historians
have done,

00:42:33.870 --> 00:42:37.540
one discounts the buoyant optimism

00:42:37.540 --> 00:42:40.850
that characterized the
American people as whole.

00:42:40.850 --> 00:42:45.170
There's not much evidence that
they were paralyzed by anxiety

00:42:45.170 --> 00:42:46.540
over the country's future.

00:42:46.540 --> 00:42:51.530
The revolution in itself
unleashed an extraordinary burst

00:42:51.530 --> 00:42:54.620
of energy and optimism.

00:42:54.620 --> 00:42:58.370
Suddenly after years of
British economic regulation,

00:42:58.370 --> 00:43:02.940
ordinary Americans devised schemes
everywhere to better their lives.

00:43:02.940 --> 00:43:06.400
Build a canal, speculate
on land, a new mill,

00:43:06.400 --> 00:43:11.660
new people were participating
in fresh and exciting,

00:43:11.660 --> 00:43:15.150
and free ways in a growing economy.

00:43:15.150 --> 00:43:17.810 position:56%
And they moved west in huge numbers.

00:43:17.810 --> 00:43:20.020
Probably the worst
thing that ever happened

00:43:20.020 --> 00:43:22.710
to the Native American
people's on this continent.

00:43:22.710 --> 00:43:24.010
But they did.

00:43:24.010 --> 00:43:25.310
Like locusts they moved west

00:43:25.310 --> 00:43:28.590
and started new lives
and took up new farms.

00:43:28.590 --> 00:43:33.650
And they had lots and
lots of children.

00:43:33.650 --> 00:43:37.330
The greatest percentage of
population growth in the history

00:43:37.330 --> 00:43:40.810
of the United States
occurred in the 1780's

00:43:40.810 --> 00:43:47.190
and it is almost not traceable to
migration from foreign country.

00:43:47.190 --> 00:43:52.050
Men and women are having kids
because they're optimistic

00:43:52.050 --> 00:43:54.380
about the future of their country.

00:43:54.380 --> 00:43:57.130
They are not sitting around saying,

00:43:57.130 --> 00:44:00.890
oh we need a strong
federal government.

00:44:00.890 --> 00:44:03.070
Where's the -- where should we go?

00:44:03.070 --> 00:44:06.120
To Philadelphia?

00:44:06.120 --> 00:44:09.750
The rejection of the
standard narrative,

00:44:09.750 --> 00:44:14.600
a smooth almost predestined tale of
gifted leaders guiding the people

00:44:14.600 --> 00:44:18.830
from colonial protest to political
stability, therefore brings

00:44:18.830 --> 00:44:24.240
into fresh focus and new
challenging concerns.

00:44:24.240 --> 00:44:27.520 position:56%
And to me, the payoff seems obvious.

00:44:27.520 --> 00:44:31.040
First, the years before
1774 become part

00:44:31.040 --> 00:44:34.220
of a genuinely imperative
world story

00:44:34.220 --> 00:44:37.940
about imperial rivalries
throughout the Atlantic world.

00:44:37.940 --> 00:44:40.420
The competition for military

00:44:40.420 --> 00:44:44.170
and commercial dominance shaped
the lives of ordinary Europeans

00:44:44.170 --> 00:44:47.930
and African slaves, as well
as indigenous people's.

00:44:47.930 --> 00:44:52.730
Second, an account of the
actual experience of living

00:44:52.730 --> 00:44:56.140
through a revolution
restores ordinary people

00:44:56.140 --> 00:45:00.500
to a tale previously dominated
by a group of leaders.

00:45:00.500 --> 00:45:03.680
It liberates us from the
obsession on the founding fathers

00:45:03.680 --> 00:45:08.970
and gives genuine agency to
the people in the creation

00:45:08.970 --> 00:45:11.760
of their own new republic.

00:45:11.760 --> 00:45:15.510
And third, by rejecting
the teleological account

00:45:15.510 --> 00:45:20.700
of the Constitution as
almost providential,

00:45:21.850 --> 00:45:28.110 position:56%
restores our appreciation of a surge
of popular entrepreneurial energy

00:45:28.110 --> 00:45:33.260
that generated excitement in
a post-revolutionary society.

00:45:33.260 --> 00:45:38.280
The new periodization of
revolution -- here I pause it --

00:45:38.280 --> 00:45:44.620
is dynamic, its open to the people
who did not pen founding documents

00:45:44.620 --> 00:45:47.650
or serve as generals or statesmen.

00:45:47.650 --> 00:45:53.730
And so, in a surge for a
more textured, more complex,

00:45:53.730 --> 00:45:59.300
more inclusive, more
comparative revolution it is time

00:45:59.300 --> 00:46:06.510
that we all ask ourselves, what
time was the American Revolution?

00:46:06.510 --> 00:46:25.040
[ Applause ]

00:46:25.040 --> 00:46:26.340
&gt;&gt; Thank you.

00:46:26.340 --> 00:46:27.640
Thank you very much.

00:46:27.640 --> 00:46:28.940
That was a wonderful talk.

00:46:28.940 --> 00:46:32.580
I've learned a great deal from it.

00:46:32.580 --> 00:46:35.810
I've asked a number
of people as a test,

00:46:35.810 --> 00:46:37.670
what gave rise to the
Boston Tea Party?

00:46:37.670 --> 00:46:41.700
Almost invariably say, well the
British increased the taxes.

00:46:41.700 --> 00:46:44.280
But I gather in fact, it
was almost the opposite,

00:46:44.280 --> 00:46:47.660
that people like Sam Adams were
smuggling tea from Holland,

00:46:47.660 --> 00:46:48.960
undercutting the British

00:46:48.960 --> 00:46:51.930
and the British dropped the
export tax to be more competitive.

00:46:51.930 --> 00:46:53.490
Now it may be more
complicated than that,

00:46:53.490 --> 00:46:55.630
but I'd like to know
what your views are.

00:46:55.630 --> 00:46:57.330
&gt;&gt; Timothy Breen: No,
you're absolutely right.

00:46:57.330 --> 00:47:04.290
Even though I was fearful that your
accent would lead to an attack,

00:47:04.290 --> 00:47:12.840
in point of fact, the tea act
would have lowered the price

00:47:12.840 --> 00:47:15.550
for the consumer.

00:47:15.550 --> 00:47:18.040
What the Americans said
is lower price or not,

00:47:18.040 --> 00:47:21.030
it's still a tax that
we didn't vote on.

00:47:21.030 --> 00:47:26.150
And so it's on principle
not acceptable.

00:47:26.150 --> 00:47:32.280
But I don't -- but again,
my point was all that aside,

00:47:32.280 --> 00:47:36.970
it was the British reaction
sending General Gage and thousands

00:47:36.970 --> 00:47:42.740
of soldiers to Boston and closing
Massachusetts to all commerce,

00:47:42.740 --> 00:47:44.570
and closing all town meetings

00:47:44.570 --> 00:47:48.970
that by then had a 200 year
history of self-government.

00:47:48.970 --> 00:47:50.590
It's exactly the same thing --

00:47:50.590 --> 00:47:53.110
I'm looking at my Irish
friend back there.

00:47:53.110 --> 00:47:56.860
It's exactly the same thing the
Brits after the Eastern rising.

00:47:56.860 --> 00:47:59.820
The Easter rising, most Irish
people felt were a bunch

00:47:59.820 --> 00:48:01.760
of nutters, you know.

00:48:01.760 --> 00:48:04.760
And they probably were.

00:48:04.760 --> 00:48:11.860
But it was the execution day after
day after day, and the humiliation

00:48:11.860 --> 00:48:19.150
of the Irish people that turned
a weak protest into a rebellion.

00:48:19.150 --> 00:48:21.090
Same thing happened here.

00:48:21.090 --> 00:48:31.140
Nut cases were made
martyrs to the people.

00:48:31.140 --> 00:48:34.760
Yes? He's going to give
you a speaker dinger.

00:48:34.760 --> 00:48:39.000
&gt;&gt; At the beginning of your lecture
you raised the intriguing question

00:48:39.000 --> 00:48:42.290
of how Americans coped
with reabsorbing those

00:48:42.290 --> 00:48:45.610
who had been the enemies within
in the wake of the revolution.

00:48:45.610 --> 00:48:46.910
&gt;&gt; Timothy Breen: Yeah.

00:48:46.910 --> 00:48:48.210
&gt;&gt; And I wonder if you could
say a little about that

00:48:48.210 --> 00:48:49.510
and your conclusions on that.

00:48:49.510 --> 00:48:50.810
&gt;&gt; Timothy Breen: Okay.

00:48:50.810 --> 00:48:52.110
Thank you very much for --

00:48:52.110 --> 00:48:55.630
because that's what I spent the
last four months studying here

00:48:55.630 --> 00:49:03.930
at the library and now Ted will
think he got his money's worth.

00:49:03.930 --> 00:49:10.960
It is cited probably
impressionistically

00:49:10.960 --> 00:49:15.540
that about 60,000 Americans left
at the end of the war and went

00:49:15.540 --> 00:49:19.150
to Nova Scotia or other places,
sometimes to the Caribbean.

00:49:19.150 --> 00:49:25.540
And of that group, a huge
number were not eager to go,

00:49:25.540 --> 00:49:28.150
because they were the slaves
owned by these people.

00:49:28.150 --> 00:49:30.410
So whatever the number is.

00:49:30.410 --> 00:49:34.920
But the research that I've done
shows that the great majority

00:49:34.920 --> 00:49:38.800
of people that had participated
as enemies of the revolution

00:49:38.800 --> 00:49:43.520
in some demonstrable way either
giving aid and comfort to the enemy

00:49:43.520 --> 00:49:48.420
or perhaps even serving in
one of their loyalist legions,

00:49:48.420 --> 00:49:53.960
far exceeded, far, far
exceeded that 60,000 number.

00:49:53.960 --> 00:49:58.460 position:56%
And this set off a very forgotten --

00:49:58.460 --> 00:50:01.860
thankfully it's forgotten
because now I can write my book --

00:50:01.860 --> 00:50:07.440
but the first rate
refugee crisis in America.

00:50:07.440 --> 00:50:10.690
Because these people that had
been enemies of the revolution --

00:50:10.690 --> 00:50:13.720
and some of them had done
some very bad things --

00:50:13.720 --> 00:50:15.580
they wanted to come home.

00:50:15.580 --> 00:50:18.240
They wanted to live with their
neighbors they had violated,

00:50:18.240 --> 00:50:20.430
and humiliated, and hurt.

00:50:20.430 --> 00:50:24.180
And the ordinary people
of American said, no way.

00:50:24.180 --> 00:50:25.480
No way.

00:50:25.480 --> 00:50:29.140
It was the leaders and the people
that signed the peace treaty

00:50:29.140 --> 00:50:36.670
in Paris that said -- as all
political documents like this,

00:50:36.670 --> 00:50:38.940
the language is very wishy washy --

00:50:38.940 --> 00:50:44.660
but that Congress of the
United States would recommend

00:50:44.660 --> 00:50:49.560 position:56%
to the separate state governments
that they would not pursue loyalists

00:50:49.560 --> 00:50:52.610
or any other people who had
acted against the interests

00:50:52.610 --> 00:50:55.970
of the United States
before the peace treaty.

00:50:55.970 --> 00:50:59.190
The people were not happy to
hear this and there were many,

00:50:59.190 --> 00:51:01.700
many incidents of local violence.

00:51:01.700 --> 00:51:05.330
The Sons of Liberty, which
we associate with the lead

00:51:05.330 --> 00:51:10.250
up to the revolution
reformed in Boston in 1783

00:51:10.250 --> 00:51:14.070
to keep the refugees out.

00:51:14.070 --> 00:51:21.950 position:56%
But in time -- by 1786 remarkably --
I think people -- they wanted farms,

00:51:21.950 --> 00:51:24.790
they wanted to go west,
they wanted to say hello

00:51:24.790 --> 00:51:26.430
to all these kids they're having.

00:51:26.430 --> 00:51:35.500
Whatever they did, the hatred
dissipated, and so it's true

00:51:35.500 --> 00:51:38.920
that for instance,
some of the leaders

00:51:38.920 --> 00:51:42.560
in the Washington cabinet
were Tories.

00:51:42.560 --> 00:51:46.070
They had, you know, come back.

00:51:46.070 --> 00:51:50.040
Trench Cocks is one
economic analysis.

00:51:50.040 --> 00:51:54.340
The point is for a concatenation
of elements in our country --

00:51:54.340 --> 00:51:56.710
and I think probably
it was its size.

00:51:56.710 --> 00:51:58.660 position:56%
Because what happened to the Tories?

00:51:58.660 --> 00:52:02.920
My answer is usually -- and
it's very glib -- is Ohio.

00:52:02.920 --> 00:52:11.680
But people found other things
to do than pursue revenge.

00:52:11.680 --> 00:52:13.320
If I may -- I don't think --

00:52:13.320 --> 00:52:18.950
I'll maybe end with a story
I found in my research here.

00:52:18.950 --> 00:52:27.380 position:56%
Some of the hottest, my physical
violent, horrible crimes of neighbor

00:52:27.380 --> 00:52:30.270
against neighbor took place
in the American south.

00:52:30.270 --> 00:52:35.300
Georgia, South Carolina,
especially up country Carolina.

00:52:35.300 --> 00:52:36.900
There's a town there that some

00:52:36.900 --> 00:52:39.570
of you may have gone
to called Ninety-six.

00:52:39.570 --> 00:52:43.320
People think I'm making it up,
but it is a town and it's 96 miles

00:52:43.320 --> 00:52:47.280
from Charleston on the
old Indian trade road.

00:52:47.280 --> 00:52:50.610
Ninety-six had some bad
times during the war.

00:52:50.610 --> 00:52:56.610
And there was a man that
had created real havoc

00:52:56.610 --> 00:53:00.000
who had the interesting
name of Matthew Love.

00:53:00.000 --> 00:53:02.020
That was the last thing
I'd associate

00:53:02.020 --> 00:53:05.050
with Matthew, because
he was a killer.

00:53:05.050 --> 00:53:08.720
But the war ended and the
peace treaty was announced

00:53:08.720 --> 00:53:11.900 position:56%
and he showed back up in Ninety-six.

00:53:11.900 --> 00:53:13.690
Said, I'm here guys.

00:53:13.690 --> 00:53:15.420
Back home.

00:53:15.420 --> 00:53:18.240
The locals said, oh boy.

00:53:18.240 --> 00:53:23.410
They locked him up in jail and they
waited for the judge to come up --

00:53:23.410 --> 00:53:26.880
because there was -- judge's
rode circuit in South Carolina --

00:53:26.880 --> 00:53:28.980
came up and it was Judge Grimke.

00:53:28.980 --> 00:53:32.440
You may recognize the name because
he had two interesting daughters

00:53:32.440 --> 00:53:36.140
who protested slavery on
the coming of the Civil War.

00:53:36.140 --> 00:53:41.510
Judge Grimke read to
the jury a statement.

00:53:41.510 --> 00:53:43.380
He said, look we hate this guy.

00:53:43.380 --> 00:53:47.010
This guy did some really bad
things, but they were war crimes

00:53:47.010 --> 00:53:52.940 position:56%
and this war and this people are not
authorized to deal with war crimes.

00:53:52.940 --> 00:53:54.240
That's another world.

00:53:54.240 --> 00:53:55.540
We're a new world.

00:53:55.540 --> 00:53:57.130
We're new South, we
have our own laws

00:53:57.130 --> 00:54:00.100
and there's nothing we
can do with Matthew Love.

00:54:00.100 --> 00:54:04.000
And he wrote in his little diary,
he said, the people listened.

00:54:04.000 --> 00:54:05.300
They were so attentive.

00:54:05.300 --> 00:54:07.260
It was like a civics
lesson, you see.

00:54:07.260 --> 00:54:08.560
They said, oh yeah, right.

00:54:08.560 --> 00:54:10.950
We have war times and now times.

00:54:10.950 --> 00:54:16.660
And they all took the Judge
Grimke back to the local hotel.

00:54:16.660 --> 00:54:19.630
Probably had a drink or
two, and he went to bed.

00:54:19.630 --> 00:54:25.810 position:56%
And the people of 96 marched back to
the jail and executed Matthew Love.

00:54:28.590 --> 00:54:33.650
And that moment resolved
the tension.

00:54:33.650 --> 00:54:36.560
That was -- for these people
that was the end of the --

00:54:36.560 --> 00:54:38.470
that was the end of the war.

00:54:38.470 --> 00:54:42.150
It wasn't a mass killing,
but there were limits.

00:54:42.150 --> 00:54:45.380
And then they found -- yes?

00:54:45.380 --> 00:54:49.870
&gt;&gt; Well thank you for the
wonderful revisionist account.

00:54:49.870 --> 00:54:53.390
But I was hoping you would
answer your own question.

00:54:53.390 --> 00:54:58.630
Namely, most revolutions
have similar beginnings.

00:54:58.630 --> 00:55:00.200
But the American Revolution had,

00:55:00.200 --> 00:55:02.290
as you pointed out, a
rather unique ending.

00:55:02.290 --> 00:55:04.200
A very successful ending.

00:55:04.200 --> 00:55:07.310
And so this [inaudible]
revolutionary optimism,

00:55:07.310 --> 00:55:10.590
how do we explain it and why
every other revolution ends

00:55:10.590 --> 00:55:14.380
in terror, in [inaudible] regimes.

00:55:14.380 --> 00:55:16.280
And so what made it possible then?

00:55:16.280 --> 00:55:18.770 position:56%
This positive revolutionary success.

00:55:18.770 --> 00:55:21.730
Even before the Constitution,
before Philadelphia.

00:55:21.730 --> 00:55:24.200
&gt;&gt; Timothy Breen: I mean, if
you do the standard count its

00:55:24.200 --> 00:55:28.630
like I know you study
religious history, whatnot.

00:55:28.630 --> 00:55:32.350
You know, its like the standard
New Testament account, you know,

00:55:32.350 --> 00:55:34.040
what books are written about.

00:55:34.040 --> 00:55:39.570
And we tell ourselves the story
of these wonderful leaders

00:55:39.570 --> 00:55:44.190
who were worried about anarchy
and lead us to stability.

00:55:44.190 --> 00:55:45.490
That's the answer.

00:55:45.490 --> 00:55:47.540
You know, we have a Constitution.

00:55:47.540 --> 00:55:52.780
The fact that it's one of the most
undemocratic documents you can

00:55:52.780 --> 00:55:55.970
possibly read is beside the point.

00:55:55.970 --> 00:56:01.660
My -- I just think that
there were elements,

00:56:01.660 --> 00:56:07.140 position:56%
mostly the [inaudible] come to
think that a much maligned historian

00:56:07.140 --> 00:56:11.690
of the late-19th Century --
Turner -- the Turner Thesis.

00:56:11.690 --> 00:56:14.430
You know, he said that
basically [inaudible].

00:56:14.430 --> 00:56:17.980
Boy, it makes a lot
of sense to me now.

00:56:17.980 --> 00:56:22.380
People rushing to Kentucky,
and Ohio, and Indiana,

00:56:22.380 --> 00:56:26.260
and reinventing themselves and
finding new ways to make money.

00:56:26.260 --> 00:56:27.560
They're not pretty.

00:56:27.560 --> 00:56:29.740
You know, this is capitalism
without control.

00:56:29.740 --> 00:56:31.410
I understand all that.

00:56:31.410 --> 00:56:38.190
But they were following a different
tangent of their lives and because

00:56:38.190 --> 00:56:41.970
of the distances out
there it made it very hard

00:56:41.970 --> 00:56:47.350
to have these post-revolutionaries
[inaudible] with France

00:56:47.350 --> 00:56:56.250
or Haiti never had a
good day [inaudible].

00:56:56.250 --> 00:56:57.550
&gt;&gt; [Inaudible].

00:56:57.550 --> 00:57:03.180
The very experience of [inaudible].

00:57:06.330 --> 00:57:10.350
What ended the revolution
is [inaudible].

00:57:10.350 --> 00:57:14.400
So it is unique.

00:57:14.400 --> 00:57:15.700
[Inaudible].

00:57:15.700 --> 00:57:19.120
&gt;&gt; Timothy Breen: I know,
and I said I didn't want

00:57:19.120 --> 00:57:24.200
to have an exceptionalism
view and I don't.

00:57:24.200 --> 00:57:34.090
But I've kind of fallen
into it beside myself.

00:57:34.090 --> 00:57:38.070
Almost anybody who
witnessed American society

00:57:38.070 --> 00:57:45.400
in the 1790's, the
Jeffersonian period.

00:57:45.400 --> 00:57:46.700
[Inaudible] was right.

00:57:46.700 --> 00:57:48.320
He was a good observer.

00:57:48.320 --> 00:57:54.520
I don't like him, but
he was a good observer.

00:57:54.520 --> 00:58:00.150
He said, you know, these
Americans they have a problem,

00:58:00.150 --> 00:58:01.980
what do they do?

00:58:01.980 --> 00:58:03.280
They form a committee.

00:58:03.280 --> 00:58:04.950
They have a group.

00:58:04.950 --> 00:58:11.630
You know, they don't turn to the
government to solve their problems.

00:58:11.630 --> 00:58:14.400
And since they came
out of the revolution

00:58:14.400 --> 00:58:22.020
that was genuine heritage
of the revolution.

00:58:22.020 --> 00:58:26.560
A mind experiment that's
very interesting, you know,

00:58:26.560 --> 00:58:33.060
is that much of what is
seen in the literature

00:58:33.060 --> 00:58:36.060
of the revolution today --
and I won't name historians.

00:58:36.060 --> 00:58:37.360
They're all wonderful and good.

00:58:37.360 --> 00:58:40.730
And that is that America
became more democratic,

00:58:40.730 --> 00:58:42.030
more open, more inclusive.

00:58:42.030 --> 00:58:46.970
And so, what everyone thinks
of those rolly polly world --

00:58:46.970 --> 00:58:48.860
Andrew Jackson -- that's the
American Revolution working

00:58:48.860 --> 00:58:50.160
itself out.

00:58:50.160 --> 00:58:51.460
Right? But lets say the
revolution hadn't occurred.

00:58:51.460 --> 00:58:52.760
How much of what we see

00:58:52.760 --> 00:58:54.060
as revolutionary would
have happened anyway?

00:58:54.060 --> 00:58:55.360
I mean is Canada a [inaudible]
that we had to avoid?

00:58:55.360 --> 00:58:56.660
No. I mean these -- England
is giving the Irish the vote

00:58:56.660 --> 00:58:57.960
for god sake.

00:58:57.960 --> 00:58:59.260
I mean these things are in the air.

00:58:59.260 --> 00:59:00.560
So what a lot of elements
that we say are part

00:59:00.560 --> 00:59:01.860
of our revolutionary heritage
would have happened anyway.

00:59:01.860 --> 00:59:03.160
All right, I'm finished.

00:59:03.160 --> 00:59:04.460
Thank you.

00:59:04.460 --> 00:59:05.760
