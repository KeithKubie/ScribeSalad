00:00:57.224 --> 00:00:58.692
JUST AS GOOD BETWEEN US
AS THEY'VE EVER BEEN.

00:00:58.725 --> 00:01:00.160

TO BE SAID

00:01:00.194 --> 00:01:01.495
FOR GOING OUT
ON A HIGH NOTE, YOU KNOW?

00:01:01.528 --> 00:01:03.197

00:01:06.433 --> 00:01:08.168
I WISH I COULD TELL YOU
THAT I WAS.

00:01:08.202 --> 00:01:10.871
- OKAY, WELL, THEN IS IT
A MIDLIFE CRISIS OR SOMETHING?

00:01:10.904 --> 00:01:12.239
'CAUSE WE COULD WORK ON IT
TOGETHER.

00:01:12.272 --> 00:01:13.707

- I'LL BE HERE FOR YOU.

00:01:13.740 --> 00:01:15.275
- WHY DOES THERE HAVE TO BE
A REASON?

00:01:15.309 --> 00:01:17.211
- WHY--WHAT--THERE HAS TO BE
A REASON, FORREST.

00:01:17.244 --> 00:01:20.080

I KNOW THIS IS VERY HARD.
THIS IS REALLY HARD.

00:01:29.122 --> 00:01:30.958
THIS IS A LOT HARDER
THAN I THOUGHT IT WAS GONNA BE.

00:01:30.991 --> 00:01:32.759

- NO, I REALLY DO.

00:01:34.294 --> 00:01:35.729
I REALLY DO LOVE YOU.
- OH, MY GOD, ERIC.

00:01:35.762 --> 00:01:38.465

00:01:43.337 --> 00:01:45.205
- HE'S NOT GONNA LIKE IT?

00:01:45.239 --> 00:01:46.907
THAT'S YOUR ANSWER?
HE'S NOT GONNA LIKE IT?

00:01:46.940 --> 00:01:48.642
