[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:00:03.960 --> 00:00:06.760
PURNIMA KOCHIKAR: Over
the last 10 years,

00:00:06.760 --> 00:00:10.300
we've built an incredible
ecosystem together.

00:00:10.300 --> 00:00:13.110
Android works on
devices of all sizes

00:00:13.110 --> 00:00:15.480
and shapes in every country.

00:00:15.480 --> 00:00:19.200
Play has become one of the
largest app distribution

00:00:19.200 --> 00:00:20.850
stores in the world.

00:00:20.850 --> 00:00:24.870
And all of you have built
amazing apps and games

00:00:24.870 --> 00:00:30.640
that entertain, educate, and
help people to get stuff done.

00:00:30.640 --> 00:00:34.060
Along the way, we have
partnered together

00:00:34.060 --> 00:00:38.920
to deal with constant change
and seize opportunities.

00:00:38.920 --> 00:00:42.100
We have entered new markets,
figured out new business models

00:00:42.100 --> 00:00:45.850
like subscription, figured
out how to have better quality

00:00:45.850 --> 00:00:50.170
apps, and delight more users.

00:00:50.170 --> 00:00:51.940
We continue to
evolve the platform

00:00:51.940 --> 00:00:54.370
based on your feedback.

00:00:54.370 --> 00:00:57.460
At any given point in
time, we have about a half

00:00:57.460 --> 00:01:01.150
a dozen or more EAPs going.

00:01:01.150 --> 00:01:03.320
Thank you for
participating in them.

00:01:03.320 --> 00:01:06.310
Some of them never see
the light of the day,

00:01:06.310 --> 00:01:11.560
and others become enormous
global programs such as prereg,

00:01:11.560 --> 00:01:14.560
which started with
a tiny pilot and now

00:01:14.560 --> 00:01:19.900
is available for all
developers on the Play Console.

00:01:19.900 --> 00:01:24.800
So building an ecosystem
is a collaborative process.

00:01:24.800 --> 00:01:28.210
So we are really grateful
for what you do with us,

00:01:28.210 --> 00:01:30.130
and we listen to you.

00:01:33.140 --> 00:01:35.830
Many of the updates
you will hear today

00:01:35.830 --> 00:01:39.490
come directly from the
feedback you have given us.

00:01:39.490 --> 00:01:42.190
You told us my app is so big.

00:01:42.190 --> 00:01:44.360
I can't add more features.

00:01:44.360 --> 00:01:49.210
Please give me data insights
to improve my app or game.

00:01:49.210 --> 00:01:53.080
And help me have
customized detailed pages

00:01:53.080 --> 00:01:57.190
when my users come to
look for my app or game.

00:01:57.190 --> 00:02:00.460
My colleagues from
product and engineering

00:02:00.460 --> 00:02:03.010
will give you more details
on what we have built,

00:02:03.010 --> 00:02:06.430
and our focus is to
make sure we help

00:02:06.430 --> 00:02:10.570
you build great apps and
successful businesses.

00:02:10.570 --> 00:02:12.980
Speaking of
successful businesses,

00:02:12.980 --> 00:02:15.970
one of the topics that
has come up a lot whenever

00:02:15.970 --> 00:02:18.820
I have spoken with
you guys recently

00:02:18.820 --> 00:02:22.190
is the topic of
sustainable growth.

00:02:22.190 --> 00:02:25.030
You have told us that you
want to build relationships

00:02:25.030 --> 00:02:29.230
with your users for years,
not weeks or months.

00:02:29.230 --> 00:02:33.550
Game developers are
building IP and storylines

00:02:33.550 --> 00:02:35.980
that have longevity
and using things

00:02:35.980 --> 00:02:38.590
like live ops and
community building

00:02:38.590 --> 00:02:42.080
to have users use their
games for the long run Ilkka

00:02:42.080 --> 00:02:44.680
Paananen, who is the
CEO of Supercell,

00:02:44.680 --> 00:02:48.640
envisions as games to be
used for 15-plus years.

00:02:48.640 --> 00:02:51.450
App developers are
also investing in this.

00:02:51.450 --> 00:02:54.280
They are looking at
subscriptions as a way

00:02:54.280 --> 00:02:57.310
to continually give
value to the users

00:02:57.310 --> 00:02:59.770
and keep them in the long run.

00:02:59.770 --> 00:03:04.720
On Play, we are also focused
on having happy users who

00:03:04.720 --> 00:03:07.300
stay with us for a long run.

00:03:07.300 --> 00:03:10.720
And for us, that
means a renewed focus

00:03:10.720 --> 00:03:13.990
on platform safety
and user trust.

00:03:13.990 --> 00:03:18.070
Users have told
us that they want

00:03:18.070 --> 00:03:20.500
to make sure that
there is transparency

00:03:20.500 --> 00:03:25.360
and control over how their
sensitive data is being used.

00:03:25.360 --> 00:03:28.000
And we are listening to them.

00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:30.700
As you heard
yesterday in queue, we

00:03:30.700 --> 00:03:33.280
are giving users more
control about how

00:03:33.280 --> 00:03:36.190
the data can be used,
whether its location access

00:03:36.190 --> 00:03:40.000
or which apps can do
background processing.

00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:43.780
On Play, they are also
strengthening our policies

00:03:43.780 --> 00:03:49.990
to further enhance safety for
users and build platform trust.

00:03:49.990 --> 00:03:52.360
We have always
encourage all of you

00:03:52.360 --> 00:03:55.540
to make sure that you only
use the permissions that you

00:03:55.540 --> 00:03:57.440
absolutely need.

00:03:57.440 --> 00:04:01.870
However, our guidelines
haven't always been consistent

00:04:01.870 --> 00:04:05.110
nor has the enforcement
been consistent.

00:04:05.110 --> 00:04:07.780
So over the last
year, we started

00:04:07.780 --> 00:04:10.040
to take a few more steps.

00:04:10.040 --> 00:04:12.820
We started to make
changes to things like SMS

00:04:12.820 --> 00:04:15.880
and call log permissions,
restricting access

00:04:15.880 --> 00:04:21.230
to only those use cases
which we believed were valid.

00:04:21.230 --> 00:04:25.780
For example, if a user
picks your messaging app

00:04:25.780 --> 00:04:31.870
as the default messaging app, we
understood that this would mean

00:04:31.870 --> 00:04:33.850
that some of the features
that you have built--

00:04:33.850 --> 00:04:36.370
even the ones that users value--

00:04:36.370 --> 00:04:40.420
may not be available once these
changes were put into motion.

00:04:40.420 --> 00:04:43.540
And we worked with you
to find alternatives.

00:04:43.540 --> 00:04:47.770
I am very happy to announce here
that based on those changes,

00:04:47.770 --> 00:04:50.650
we have reduced apps
that get access to SMS

00:04:50.650 --> 00:04:53.590
and call log by 98%.

00:04:53.590 --> 00:04:56.530
And in doing so, we
have managed to get

00:04:56.530 --> 00:04:59.950
most people to have some
other way of accessing

00:04:59.950 --> 00:05:05.050
the same functionality or
eliminate minor functionality.

00:05:05.050 --> 00:05:07.150
There are more changes coming.

00:05:07.150 --> 00:05:10.810
In these changes, we are going
to think about all the stuff

00:05:10.810 --> 00:05:14.230
that's happening on q and
look about what those changes

00:05:14.230 --> 00:05:17.140
we need to do on Play
to safeguard more apps

00:05:17.140 --> 00:05:21.760
and games as especially those
that are targeting families.

00:05:21.760 --> 00:05:27.210
As we make those changes, we
will continue to listen to you.

00:05:27.210 --> 00:05:32.750
So you told us that our
change process, the input

00:05:32.750 --> 00:05:37.880
form, the appeals process,
the actions you need to take,

00:05:37.880 --> 00:05:39.780
has room for improvement.

00:05:39.780 --> 00:05:41.150
And we hear you.

00:05:41.150 --> 00:05:44.090
So here's my commitment
to you today.

00:05:44.090 --> 00:05:48.050
We will be more transparent
about the changes we will make,

00:05:48.050 --> 00:05:50.840
the actions you
need to take, and we

00:05:50.840 --> 00:05:54.930
will give you sufficient
time to make those changes.

00:05:54.930 --> 00:05:56.900
And here's my ask of you.

00:05:56.900 --> 00:05:59.390
Please pay attention
to our comms.

00:05:59.390 --> 00:06:03.650
They will be on your Play
Console, emails, logs,

00:06:03.650 --> 00:06:05.830
and prioritize these changes.

00:06:05.830 --> 00:06:09.410
Together, we will build
an ecosystem which

00:06:09.410 --> 00:06:13.070
businesses are sustainable
and users are happy

00:06:13.070 --> 00:06:15.420
and stay for the long run.

00:06:15.420 --> 00:06:18.260
So now let's talk
about what's new.

00:06:18.260 --> 00:06:21.110
So I have my colleagues
coming up to give you details.

00:06:21.110 --> 00:06:24.050
Kobi will come up
and talk about ways

00:06:24.050 --> 00:06:28.640
to develop apps to reach
lots of users using features

00:06:28.640 --> 00:06:33.080
such as such as Android
app bundles and Play's

00:06:33.080 --> 00:06:34.610
dynamic delivery.

00:06:34.610 --> 00:06:38.180
And then Molina will come in and
talk about release tools that

00:06:38.180 --> 00:06:42.230
help you iterate quickly
release preand then

00:06:42.230 --> 00:06:47.150
think about tracking performance
and improving your app post

00:06:47.150 --> 00:06:48.170
launch.

00:06:48.170 --> 00:06:50.840
And then we have Aurash
coming in and talking

00:06:50.840 --> 00:06:54.560
about the many tools we have
built to grow your business

00:06:54.560 --> 00:06:59.070
sustainably through things like
marketing and monetization.

00:06:59.070 --> 00:07:01.940
So without further ado,
put your hands together

00:07:01.940 --> 00:07:04.762
to welcome Kobi Glick.

00:07:04.762 --> 00:07:08.370
[APPLAUSE]

00:07:08.370 --> 00:07:10.830
KOBI GLICK: Purnima.

00:07:10.830 --> 00:07:12.160
Hi, everyone.

00:07:12.160 --> 00:07:14.610
I'm Kobi from the Play Store.

00:07:14.610 --> 00:07:17.100
I want to show you how
to use our platform

00:07:17.100 --> 00:07:21.950
to reach more users
and grow your business.

00:07:21.950 --> 00:07:24.980
Google Play has always
focused on developer needs,

00:07:24.980 --> 00:07:27.350
and those needs didn't
change that much since we

00:07:27.350 --> 00:07:29.720
launched Play a few years ago.

00:07:29.720 --> 00:07:32.420
You need to build an
app, deliver it to users,

00:07:32.420 --> 00:07:34.110
and grow your business.

00:07:34.110 --> 00:07:38.600
This includes driving discovery,
engagement, monetization,

00:07:38.600 --> 00:07:41.180
and analyzing your
app performance.

00:07:41.180 --> 00:07:44.360
But while your basic needs
didn't change that much,

00:07:44.360 --> 00:07:47.430
Google Play has gotten
much, much bigger.

00:07:47.430 --> 00:07:51.110
Plano serves a tremendous number
of users all over the world--

00:07:51.110 --> 00:07:53.360
users coming from
different cultures,

00:07:53.360 --> 00:07:56.390
speaking different languages,
using different devices

00:07:56.390 --> 00:07:58.520
and connectivity profiles.

00:07:58.520 --> 00:08:02.430
And it's created new
challenges and opportunities.

00:08:02.430 --> 00:08:05.820
And to open the door for this
new business opportunity,

00:08:05.820 --> 00:08:09.110
you need to tackle some
more complex business needs.

00:08:09.110 --> 00:08:13.077
For example, how do you reach
users in emerging markets,

00:08:13.077 --> 00:08:14.660
how do you communicate
to those users.

00:08:17.018 --> 00:08:18.560
How do you communicate
to those users

00:08:18.560 --> 00:08:21.110
for your start listing
page in Google Play?

00:08:21.110 --> 00:08:25.790
How do you build your app was
storage and data costs in mind?

00:08:25.790 --> 00:08:29.120
So as we've grown, we introduced
a number of tools and features

00:08:29.120 --> 00:08:32.390
to help you tackle those
new business needs.

00:08:32.390 --> 00:08:34.039
In this talk, we're
going to show you

00:08:34.039 --> 00:08:36.830
a bunch of features
we're launching today

00:08:36.830 --> 00:08:40.190
to help you develop,
release, and grow your apps

00:08:40.190 --> 00:08:42.770
and games on Google Play.

00:08:42.770 --> 00:08:44.960
Let's start with development.

00:08:44.960 --> 00:08:46.730
When you think about
the Play Store,

00:08:46.730 --> 00:08:49.280
you typically think
about the store front,

00:08:49.280 --> 00:08:50.930
but Play's more than that.

00:08:50.930 --> 00:08:53.150
Behind the scenes,
we're doing a lot

00:08:53.150 --> 00:08:55.910
to keep your apps and games
up to date and your business

00:08:55.910 --> 00:08:57.825
running.

00:08:57.825 --> 00:09:00.200
And I want to give you some
context about the scale we're

00:09:00.200 --> 00:09:01.550
dealing with.

00:09:01.550 --> 00:09:05.210
Every month, we
send two exabytes

00:09:05.210 --> 00:09:07.190
of app installs and updates.

00:09:07.190 --> 00:09:09.390
This is a huge amount of data.

00:09:09.390 --> 00:09:13.070
And in fact the raw
data size is 5 exabytes.

00:09:13.070 --> 00:09:15.410
But thanks to Play's
patching and compression,

00:09:15.410 --> 00:09:19.890
we're able to cut down the
download size for users by 60%.

00:09:19.890 --> 00:09:22.730
This is not only great for
users, but also for you

00:09:22.730 --> 00:09:28.272
since it makes your app delivery
more efficient and reliable.

00:09:28.272 --> 00:09:29.730
And that's not the
only thing we're

00:09:29.730 --> 00:09:33.060
doing to make your app
development more efficient.

00:09:33.060 --> 00:09:34.830
Last year, we
introduced a change

00:09:34.830 --> 00:09:38.280
to the APK format you've been
using for the first 10 years

00:09:38.280 --> 00:09:39.540
on Android.

00:09:39.540 --> 00:09:42.250
We told you why we think
it's a time for a change.

00:09:42.250 --> 00:09:43.080
Why?

00:09:43.080 --> 00:09:45.690
Because the APK is inefficient.

00:09:45.690 --> 00:09:47.700
Security could be
better, and it's

00:09:47.700 --> 00:09:50.220
built from monolithic apps.

00:09:50.220 --> 00:09:55.350
With the APK, devices get code
and resources they don't need.

00:09:55.350 --> 00:09:58.390
If you ever lose or
compromise your signing key,

00:09:58.390 --> 00:10:01.830
you need to abandon your app
and create a new listing.

00:10:01.830 --> 00:10:05.160
And you always have to ship
each one of your features

00:10:05.160 --> 00:10:07.930
to all your users.

00:10:07.930 --> 00:10:10.470
So last year, we introduced
Android's new publishing

00:10:10.470 --> 00:10:14.430
format, the Android app
bundle, and a completely new

00:10:14.430 --> 00:10:17.250
dynamic delivery
framework on Google Play.

00:10:17.250 --> 00:10:22.890
The bundle is efficient, secure,
and it enables modular apps.

00:10:22.890 --> 00:10:25.750
And the momentum we've
seen is incredible.

00:10:25.750 --> 00:10:28.740
There are now over
80,000 apps and games

00:10:28.740 --> 00:10:31.890
that switched to App Bundle
in production and Google Play

00:10:31.890 --> 00:10:36.150
with an average size
reduction of 20%.

00:10:36.150 --> 00:10:40.200
As a result of the size savings,
app switching to the Bundle C

00:10:40.200 --> 00:10:44.850
up to 11% install uplift.

00:10:44.850 --> 00:10:46.800
Let's take a look at
some of the apps who

00:10:46.800 --> 00:10:49.980
switched with the bundle
and their size savings.

00:10:49.980 --> 00:10:52.260
You can see apps
like Twitter, who

00:10:52.260 --> 00:10:55.930
were part of our early access
developer program last year.

00:10:55.930 --> 00:10:59.580
And you can see apps
like PayPal, Tinder,

00:10:59.580 --> 00:11:01.600
and "Clash of
Clans" by supercell

00:11:01.600 --> 00:11:04.980
who switched with the
bundle earlier this year.

00:11:04.980 --> 00:11:07.680
And more Google Apps
are switching too--

00:11:07.680 --> 00:11:11.880
Photos, Home, and Duo
all now use our bundles

00:11:11.880 --> 00:11:15.240
in production in Google Play
with some very significant side

00:11:15.240 --> 00:11:19.590
savings, like you
can see right here.

00:11:19.590 --> 00:11:22.200
To help you track and
optimize your app size,

00:11:22.200 --> 00:11:25.320
today, we're launching a new
section of Android vitals

00:11:25.320 --> 00:11:29.300
with new metrics, reporting,
and guidance in this area.

00:11:29.300 --> 00:11:32.500
You will be able to see both
the download size of your app,

00:11:32.500 --> 00:11:36.390
as well as the size of your
app right after the install.

00:11:36.390 --> 00:11:39.420
We will show you how your
app size changes over time

00:11:39.420 --> 00:11:44.420
and provide you information
on how to further reduce it.

00:11:44.420 --> 00:11:47.180
So that's the efficiency
aspect of the App Bundle.

00:11:47.180 --> 00:11:49.650
Now let's talk about
the security aspect.

00:11:49.650 --> 00:11:52.570
You're signing key is no
more secure because Google

00:11:52.570 --> 00:11:56.080
Play holds a copy and
protects it from loss.

00:11:56.080 --> 00:11:58.090
And today, we're
launching a new feature

00:11:58.090 --> 00:12:00.520
that allows you to upgrade
the cryptographic strength

00:12:00.520 --> 00:12:04.420
of your signing key for new
installs and their updates.

00:12:04.420 --> 00:12:08.030
Some apps on Google Play
sign with old signing keys,

00:12:08.030 --> 00:12:11.440
and our new feature is the
only backward compatible way

00:12:11.440 --> 00:12:13.150
to increase their strength.

00:12:13.150 --> 00:12:15.690
And it's only available
when you enrolled into apps

00:12:15.690 --> 00:12:18.580
signing by Google Play.

00:12:18.580 --> 00:12:21.790
Finally, let's talk about
the modularity aspect.

00:12:21.790 --> 00:12:24.070
The App Bundle
introduces modularization

00:12:24.070 --> 00:12:26.950
through dynamic feature modules.

00:12:26.950 --> 00:12:29.080
This increases
engineering velocity

00:12:29.080 --> 00:12:33.130
because teams can design,
build, and maintain features

00:12:33.130 --> 00:12:34.990
independently.

00:12:34.990 --> 00:12:37.480
Facebook, for example,
has found success

00:12:37.480 --> 00:12:40.570
using dynamic features to
implement functionality

00:12:40.570 --> 00:12:43.560
that is relatively separate
than the rest of the app.

00:12:43.560 --> 00:12:46.120
They're then adding those
features to the main app

00:12:46.120 --> 00:12:50.110
without increasing
its base install size.

00:12:50.110 --> 00:12:54.490
Dynamic features allow you to
customize when and to whom you

00:12:54.490 --> 00:12:57.240
deliver specific functionality.

00:12:57.240 --> 00:12:59.740
Today, we're announcing that
dynamic features are coming out

00:12:59.740 --> 00:13:03.160
of beta and are now available
to all of you, including

00:13:03.160 --> 00:13:06.453
some new delivery options.

00:13:06.453 --> 00:13:08.620
With dynamic features, you
can deliver functionality

00:13:08.620 --> 00:13:10.190
on demand.

00:13:10.190 --> 00:13:12.700
For example, redBus
is an app that

00:13:12.700 --> 00:13:15.220
allows users by bus tickets.

00:13:15.220 --> 00:13:18.700
They use dynamic features
to test a new business idea,

00:13:18.700 --> 00:13:22.960
allowing enterprise consumers
to book tickets for events.

00:13:22.960 --> 00:13:25.630
Dynamic features are
perfect for this use case

00:13:25.630 --> 00:13:29.230
because redBus is able to
target specific audience

00:13:29.230 --> 00:13:31.300
and determine the
product market fit

00:13:31.300 --> 00:13:33.760
for this new line of business.

00:13:33.760 --> 00:13:36.100
The ability to deliver
this feature only

00:13:36.100 --> 00:13:38.170
to users who want
them allows redBus

00:13:38.170 --> 00:13:41.920
to keep their upsized small
at the point of install

00:13:41.920 --> 00:13:44.320
and provide a more
customized experience

00:13:44.320 --> 00:13:49.120
to users who are interested in
this additional functionality.

00:13:49.120 --> 00:13:50.980
Today, we're also
introducing the option

00:13:50.980 --> 00:13:53.440
to deliver features
conditionally

00:13:53.440 --> 00:13:55.330
at the time of install.

00:13:55.330 --> 00:13:57.940
This means you can control
which parts of your app

00:13:57.940 --> 00:13:59.770
would be delivered
to users based

00:13:59.770 --> 00:14:03.500
on the country or the
features of their device.

00:14:03.500 --> 00:14:06.610
For example, if you
have an AR feature,

00:14:06.610 --> 00:14:11.560
you can decide to install it
only on AR capable devices.

00:14:11.560 --> 00:14:13.960
As you see here, you can
define a feature module

00:14:13.960 --> 00:14:18.940
as conditional with a very
simple change to app manifest.

00:14:18.940 --> 00:14:21.280
You can also instant
enable modules

00:14:21.280 --> 00:14:23.560
to offer instant experiences.

00:14:23.560 --> 00:14:26.680
The Android App Bundle now
fully supports Instant Apps.

00:14:26.680 --> 00:14:29.680
So you can build and
publish a single artifact

00:14:29.680 --> 00:14:35.740
for both your Instant Apps
and installed experiences.

00:14:35.740 --> 00:14:38.410
During our beta program,
we had many developers

00:14:38.410 --> 00:14:39.970
who implemented
some very cool use

00:14:39.970 --> 00:14:42.140
cases with dynamic features.

00:14:42.140 --> 00:14:45.400
For example, like you've
seen in the video earlier,

00:14:45.400 --> 00:14:48.730
Netflix is now delivering their
customer support functionality

00:14:48.730 --> 00:14:53.180
to their users as a dynamic
feature in production.

00:14:53.180 --> 00:14:56.260
This means that only users
that need to call for support

00:14:56.260 --> 00:14:59.040
actually need to
download this feature.

00:14:59.040 --> 00:15:01.600
By using the App Bundle
and dynamic delivery

00:15:01.600 --> 00:15:03.940
features such as
this, Netflix were

00:15:03.940 --> 00:15:07.570
able to reduce the download
size order up by 33%--

00:15:07.570 --> 00:15:10.990
from 23 megabyte to 15
megabytes and they're just

00:15:10.990 --> 00:15:13.400
getting started.

00:15:13.400 --> 00:15:16.180
So switch to App Bundle
for the size savings

00:15:16.180 --> 00:15:18.970
and stay for the customizable
delivery options.

00:15:18.970 --> 00:15:20.980
We're big believers
in app modularity.

00:15:20.980 --> 00:15:23.340
We think this is
the future of apps,

00:15:23.340 --> 00:15:28.557
and our dynamic framework
paves the way to that future.

00:15:28.557 --> 00:15:30.640
And there's one more thing
we're launching as part

00:15:30.640 --> 00:15:32.620
of our dynamic framework today.

00:15:32.620 --> 00:15:37.430
The in-app updates API is
now available to all of you.

00:15:37.430 --> 00:15:39.580
We know that sometime it's
really important for you

00:15:39.580 --> 00:15:43.060
to get your users on the
latest version of your app.

00:15:43.060 --> 00:15:45.760
We've seen how some
developers implemented this

00:15:45.760 --> 00:15:50.420
through blocking screens or
even send emails to their users.

00:15:50.420 --> 00:15:52.900
So one of your top
requests from Google Play

00:15:52.900 --> 00:15:54.730
was that we allow
you to update users

00:15:54.730 --> 00:15:56.770
that are on an old version.

00:15:56.770 --> 00:15:59.800
And today, we're excited
to make it happen.

00:15:59.800 --> 00:16:03.010
Our new API allows you
to get users to update

00:16:03.010 --> 00:16:05.890
without ever leaving your app.

00:16:05.890 --> 00:16:07.810
Here's the popular
Indian food delivery

00:16:07.810 --> 00:16:12.430
app Swiggy using the
flexible update flow

00:16:12.430 --> 00:16:15.190
to provide a user experience
that matches their look

00:16:15.190 --> 00:16:16.540
and feel.

00:16:16.540 --> 00:16:19.140
You can also use
the immediate flow

00:16:19.140 --> 00:16:21.190
for first simpler
integration that

00:16:21.190 --> 00:16:25.090
handles every aspect
of the update flow.

00:16:25.090 --> 00:16:27.160
Across all our
early axis partners,

00:16:27.160 --> 00:16:29.560
we've seen a median
user acceptance rate

00:16:29.560 --> 00:16:34.640
of 50% for such in-app updates.

00:16:34.640 --> 00:16:37.030
So that's it for the
development section,

00:16:37.030 --> 00:16:39.670
and now Milena will tell
you about releasing your app

00:16:39.670 --> 00:16:41.570
and analyzing its performance.

00:16:41.570 --> 00:16:42.374
Thank you.

00:16:42.374 --> 00:16:45.832
[APPLAUSE]

00:16:46.106 --> 00:16:47.314
MILENA NIKOLIC: Thanks, Kobi.

00:16:50.780 --> 00:16:54.590
Releasing your app or an update
is the most critical activity

00:16:54.590 --> 00:16:56.810
you can do in the Play Console.

00:16:56.810 --> 00:16:59.120
It's how you actually
deliver all the great things

00:16:59.120 --> 00:17:01.700
you build to your users.

00:17:01.700 --> 00:17:05.839
And every month, more
than 750,000 APKs

00:17:05.839 --> 00:17:08.599
get rolled out to Play Console.

00:17:08.599 --> 00:17:11.660
That represents more than
half a million app makers,

00:17:11.660 --> 00:17:14.060
like yourselves,
excited to be pushing

00:17:14.060 --> 00:17:18.599
their latest and greatest
changes to their user audience.

00:17:18.599 --> 00:17:20.390
And again, it started simple--

00:17:20.390 --> 00:17:23.630
release a single a big to
production, which we released

00:17:23.630 --> 00:17:26.329
with the very first version
of Android market publisher

00:17:26.329 --> 00:17:29.990
site back in 2009.

00:17:29.990 --> 00:17:33.140
But as Android apps
got more traction,

00:17:33.140 --> 00:17:35.630
the needs to test your
app before releasing

00:17:35.630 --> 00:17:38.070
it became more important.

00:17:38.070 --> 00:17:41.120
Play led the mobile developer
market in this sense

00:17:41.120 --> 00:17:46.730
and launched beta testing
and stage rollouts in 2013.

00:17:46.730 --> 00:17:50.000
We're proud to say we were
the first to introduce

00:17:50.000 --> 00:17:53.240
the tools, which are now the
established best practice

00:17:53.240 --> 00:17:58.450
for successful
mobile developers.

00:17:58.450 --> 00:18:01.060
In 2016, Play
introduced open beat

00:18:01.060 --> 00:18:03.440
them allowing you
to massively scale

00:18:03.440 --> 00:18:07.847
beta testing even before
public launch of your app.

00:18:07.847 --> 00:18:09.430
This has become a
super popular choice

00:18:09.430 --> 00:18:11.860
for leading app
developers like WhatsApp,

00:18:11.860 --> 00:18:16.510
now have 25 million
open beta testers.

00:18:16.510 --> 00:18:19.540
You then told us you wanted
more tools to further ensure

00:18:19.540 --> 00:18:21.050
your apps are ready to launch.

00:18:21.050 --> 00:18:24.180
So last year, we
launched internal testing

00:18:24.180 --> 00:18:27.850
to help you create
faster test releases.

00:18:27.850 --> 00:18:34.000
Now more than 150,000 apps
use internal testing tracks.

00:18:34.000 --> 00:18:36.850
We also launch multiple
close testing tracks

00:18:36.850 --> 00:18:38.740
to help you vet
different feature

00:18:38.740 --> 00:18:41.290
releases with different
groups of testers,

00:18:41.290 --> 00:18:45.150
for example, different
themes within your company.

00:18:45.150 --> 00:18:50.080
To date, 35,000 apps
have used this feature.

00:18:50.080 --> 00:18:52.870
And this year, we're pushing
the envelope even further.

00:18:52.870 --> 00:18:54.880
You told us that it's
sometimes painful

00:18:54.880 --> 00:18:58.000
to have to create a
release just if you

00:18:58.000 --> 00:19:01.120
want to share a test build
with a member of your QA

00:19:01.120 --> 00:19:03.250
team or your product manager.

00:19:03.250 --> 00:19:08.050
So today, we're launching
internal app sharing.

00:19:08.050 --> 00:19:10.720
This new feature allows
you to share test builds

00:19:10.720 --> 00:19:13.180
with your team in a
matter of seconds--

00:19:13.180 --> 00:19:16.290
just drag and drop in our
bundle and get a sharable URL

00:19:16.290 --> 00:19:19.000
to install your desk version.

00:19:19.000 --> 00:19:21.843
You don't need to worry about
version code, signing keys,

00:19:21.843 --> 00:19:23.260
or most other
validations that you

00:19:23.260 --> 00:19:26.080
need to think about when you're
launching your production

00:19:26.080 --> 00:19:28.360
release.

00:19:28.360 --> 00:19:31.000
We believe this combination
of a speedy upload

00:19:31.000 --> 00:19:34.330
and fully featured Play
distribution will enable

00:19:34.330 --> 00:19:38.320
you to iterate faster and better
even as the ecosystem grows

00:19:38.320 --> 00:19:40.130
more complex.

00:19:40.130 --> 00:19:42.940
This also addresses the
biggest feature requests

00:19:42.940 --> 00:19:46.270
that we've heard from you,
which was to provide better

00:19:46.270 --> 00:19:50.630
App Bundle testing, integration
into your workflows.

00:19:50.630 --> 00:19:54.520
Now you can simply upload your
bundle, get a shareable URL,

00:19:54.520 --> 00:19:58.090
and use this URL to download
the APKs that are then

00:19:58.090 --> 00:20:02.040
dynamically delivered by Play.

00:20:02.040 --> 00:20:04.150
OK, so now that you
released your app,

00:20:04.150 --> 00:20:07.860
let's talk about how you analyze
its health and performance.

00:20:07.860 --> 00:20:09.600
Here we first started
with a simple list

00:20:09.600 --> 00:20:12.720
of crash reports, which
was helpful but not

00:20:12.720 --> 00:20:14.280
actionable enough.

00:20:14.280 --> 00:20:15.570
Every app crashes sometimes.

00:20:15.570 --> 00:20:19.320
The important question is is
your app actually doing well?

00:20:19.320 --> 00:20:22.830
So a couple of years ago,
we launched Android Vitals.

00:20:22.830 --> 00:20:25.650
Vitals include 15
engineering metrics

00:20:25.650 --> 00:20:30.210
across five performance areas
that represent the things users

00:20:30.210 --> 00:20:32.520
care about the most.

00:20:32.520 --> 00:20:35.820
They represent the performance
and quality of your app as

00:20:35.820 --> 00:20:39.720
experienced on real devices
in the hands of real users

00:20:39.720 --> 00:20:41.900
in the real world.

00:20:41.900 --> 00:20:45.720
Today, over 100,000
developers use Android Vitals,

00:20:45.720 --> 00:20:49.273
including 60% of top 1,000.

00:20:49.273 --> 00:20:50.690
It's an important
tool to help you

00:20:50.690 --> 00:20:54.080
focus your improvements exactly
where we have the biggest

00:20:54.080 --> 00:20:56.110
opportunities.

00:20:56.110 --> 00:20:58.570
Did you know that 42%
of one star reviews

00:20:58.570 --> 00:21:00.930
mentioned stability or bugs?

00:21:00.930 --> 00:21:03.940
App performance matters,
and Android Vitals

00:21:03.940 --> 00:21:07.180
can help you address it.

00:21:07.180 --> 00:21:09.190
Last year, we launched
category benchmarks

00:21:09.190 --> 00:21:11.680
to show you how your app
performs against other apps

00:21:11.680 --> 00:21:13.060
in your category.

00:21:13.060 --> 00:21:14.950
But you told us
those benchmarks were

00:21:14.950 --> 00:21:18.580
too broad to yield
meaningful results.

00:21:18.580 --> 00:21:20.080
We thought about
this feedback a lot

00:21:20.080 --> 00:21:23.440
and spent a long time trying
to work out a solution that

00:21:23.440 --> 00:21:25.300
works for everyone.

00:21:25.300 --> 00:21:28.060
On the one hand, we know
we're in a unique position

00:21:28.060 --> 00:21:30.070
to share data
across the ecosystem

00:21:30.070 --> 00:21:31.900
that you can't
get anywhere else.

00:21:31.900 --> 00:21:33.910
But on the other
hand, we also need

00:21:33.910 --> 00:21:36.460
to protect the privacy
of individual businesses

00:21:36.460 --> 00:21:37.550
that we serve.

00:21:37.550 --> 00:21:40.660
So how can we bridge this gap?

00:21:40.660 --> 00:21:44.050
Today, we're pleased to
announce developer selected peer

00:21:44.050 --> 00:21:47.000
benchmarks for Android vitals.

00:21:47.000 --> 00:21:51.010
You can also a team of eight
to 12 peers to compare your app

00:21:51.010 --> 00:21:54.440
to, then see the median
value for the peer,

00:21:54.440 --> 00:21:56.620
as well as the difference
between your app

00:21:56.620 --> 00:21:59.680
and your peer's.

00:21:59.680 --> 00:22:00.940
And it's not just for vitals.

00:22:00.940 --> 00:22:03.040
We're building new
benchmarks platform

00:22:03.040 --> 00:22:04.990
in a fully generic way.

00:22:04.990 --> 00:22:06.700
So over the next
few months, you'll

00:22:06.700 --> 00:22:09.100
be able to see the
benchmark value for almost

00:22:09.100 --> 00:22:11.500
any metric in the console.

00:22:11.500 --> 00:22:13.900
For public metrics,
like operating,

00:22:13.900 --> 00:22:15.550
you can see benchmarks
for the peer

00:22:15.550 --> 00:22:18.780
set you've manually selected.

00:22:18.780 --> 00:22:21.580
And for business sensitive
metrics, like conversion rate,

00:22:21.580 --> 00:22:24.250
you can compare your app
to an autogenerated peer

00:22:24.250 --> 00:22:28.790
set of around 100
most similar apps.

00:22:28.790 --> 00:22:31.720
So now we can finally know
if your numbers are good

00:22:31.720 --> 00:22:34.150
and whether you're keeping
up with your peers.

00:22:34.150 --> 00:22:37.630
For example, you'll be able to
see if your uninstall rate is

00:22:37.630 --> 00:22:40.480
higher than your peers,
then compare how you're

00:22:40.480 --> 00:22:42.880
doing going to common
causes of retention issues

00:22:42.880 --> 00:22:46.120
like crash rate or a APK size.

00:22:46.120 --> 00:22:51.000
We're super excited to see how
you use this data to get ahead.

00:22:51.000 --> 00:22:53.500
OK, let's talk some more
about the business performance

00:22:53.500 --> 00:22:54.570
reports.

00:22:54.570 --> 00:22:58.360
Here we also started with
simple basic install metrics,

00:22:58.360 --> 00:23:01.480
then over the years expanded
to specialized reports

00:23:01.480 --> 00:23:05.060
to give you more critical
insights into your revenue

00:23:05.060 --> 00:23:07.240
and acquisition.

00:23:07.240 --> 00:23:09.580
We even added by
our reporting tool

00:23:09.580 --> 00:23:14.320
for you to track immediate
effects of your updates.

00:23:14.320 --> 00:23:17.500
Today, we're announcing the
biggest change the core metrics

00:23:17.500 --> 00:23:21.310
since we started the data
reporting in the console.

00:23:21.310 --> 00:23:23.320
Our teams have been
working for almost a year

00:23:23.320 --> 00:23:27.610
to redefine and rebuild these
metrics from the ground up,

00:23:27.610 --> 00:23:30.340
all to enable you to answer some
of the most critical business

00:23:30.340 --> 00:23:31.630
questions that you have.

00:23:31.630 --> 00:23:34.000
For example, how many
new users you acquired

00:23:34.000 --> 00:23:39.330
or how many existing users
you lost in the past 30 days?

00:23:39.330 --> 00:23:42.820
The new metrics are
broader and more accurate.

00:23:42.820 --> 00:23:46.450
For example, you'll now be able
to see a reporting on returning

00:23:46.450 --> 00:23:48.460
users, which is critical
for understanding

00:23:48.460 --> 00:23:50.770
your total acquisition.

00:23:50.770 --> 00:23:53.740
You can query the performance
by acquisition channels that

00:23:53.740 --> 00:23:56.230
only play an insight
into, for example,

00:23:56.230 --> 00:23:59.590
peer to peer sharing
and app preinstalls.

00:23:59.590 --> 00:24:02.470
And you can reliably
aggregate and dedupe

00:24:02.470 --> 00:24:07.510
all of this over periods
from hours to quarters.

00:24:07.510 --> 00:24:09.670
Our main focus was to
give you the right data,

00:24:09.670 --> 00:24:11.590
but all in all,
this new launch also

00:24:11.590 --> 00:24:15.730
offers 10 times more metrics and
variations than you currently

00:24:15.730 --> 00:24:17.650
have access to.

00:24:17.650 --> 00:24:19.880
And to make data
consumption easier,

00:24:19.880 --> 00:24:21.310
we've updated the
statistics page

00:24:21.310 --> 00:24:23.950
to automatically
perform common analysis

00:24:23.950 --> 00:24:27.810
like benchmarking growth rates
and performing automatic period

00:24:27.810 --> 00:24:30.190
and period charting.

00:24:30.190 --> 00:24:31.865
So to recap, new
metrics will give

00:24:31.865 --> 00:24:33.490
you insight into your
app's performance

00:24:33.490 --> 00:24:35.300
that you've never had before.

00:24:35.300 --> 00:24:39.080
And the new stats page will
help you find out what happened,

00:24:39.080 --> 00:24:44.050
why it happened, and whether
what happened was good or not.

00:24:44.050 --> 00:24:46.180
We're also making changes
to another key source

00:24:46.180 --> 00:24:49.960
of performance data,
your user reviews.

00:24:49.960 --> 00:24:52.900
Many of you asked us to change
the way we calculate Google

00:24:52.900 --> 00:24:56.530
Play store rating to better
reflect the current quality

00:24:56.530 --> 00:24:58.323
of your app or game.

00:24:58.323 --> 00:24:59.740
You told us that
you want a rating

00:24:59.740 --> 00:25:03.430
based on what your app is today,
not what it was years ago.

00:25:03.430 --> 00:25:05.260
And we agree.

00:25:05.260 --> 00:25:08.470
So today, I'm happy to announce
that the average rating

00:25:08.470 --> 00:25:10.940
calculation is changing.

00:25:10.940 --> 00:25:13.710
Instead of a lifetime
cumulative value,

00:25:13.710 --> 00:25:16.390
your new average will
be recalculated to give

00:25:16.390 --> 00:25:19.930
more weight to the
most recent ratings.

00:25:19.930 --> 00:25:22.240
With this change,
your place the rating

00:25:22.240 --> 00:25:25.030
will not only give users
better understanding

00:25:25.030 --> 00:25:27.110
of the current
state of your app.

00:25:27.110 --> 00:25:29.740
It will also better
reflect all your hard work

00:25:29.740 --> 00:25:31.720
and improvements.

00:25:31.720 --> 00:25:34.300
Users won't see the updated
value in the Play Store

00:25:34.300 --> 00:25:38.050
until August, but you can
preview your new rating

00:25:38.050 --> 00:25:41.360
in the Play Console today.

00:25:41.360 --> 00:25:45.320
Of course, ratings are only
half of the feedback equation.

00:25:45.320 --> 00:25:47.950
Your users also leave reviews.

00:25:47.950 --> 00:25:52.220
Everyday developers respond
to more than 100,000 reviews

00:25:52.220 --> 00:25:53.720
into Play Console.

00:25:53.720 --> 00:25:55.490
And when they do,
we've seen that users

00:25:55.490 --> 00:25:57.680
react very positively.

00:25:57.680 --> 00:26:00.020
When receiving a
reply from developers,

00:26:00.020 --> 00:26:04.950
users increase their rating
by 0.7 stars on average.

00:26:04.950 --> 00:26:06.530
Soin addition to
the ratings change,

00:26:06.530 --> 00:26:10.640
we're making it easier to
respond to user reviews.

00:26:10.640 --> 00:26:13.070
Build by Google
Research suggested

00:26:13.070 --> 00:26:16.670
replies uses machine learning
to provide one TouchSmart

00:26:16.670 --> 00:26:20.690
responses for easier
text communication.

00:26:20.690 --> 00:26:23.090
You may already be familiar
with this type of feature

00:26:23.090 --> 00:26:25.620
from Gmail and Messages.

00:26:25.620 --> 00:26:28.130
But if you're not,
it's very easy to use.

00:26:28.130 --> 00:26:30.230
When you go to reply
to user review.

00:26:30.230 --> 00:26:33.110
You can see three
suggested replies.

00:26:33.110 --> 00:26:34.610
They have been
created automatically

00:26:34.610 --> 00:26:37.010
based on the content
of a user review

00:26:37.010 --> 00:26:41.030
and the way you naturally
communicate to your users.

00:26:41.030 --> 00:26:43.080
You can choose to
send one as-is.

00:26:43.080 --> 00:26:45.440
You can customize it for
more personalization,

00:26:45.440 --> 00:26:47.960
or you can write in
your reply from scratch.

00:26:47.960 --> 00:26:50.720
The choice is yours.

00:26:50.720 --> 00:26:52.280
All these new features
I talked about

00:26:52.280 --> 00:26:54.320
were designed with
one thing in mind,

00:26:54.320 --> 00:26:58.190
to help you succeed by
enabling you to release faster,

00:26:58.190 --> 00:27:01.850
measure your app health, and
improve your performance.

00:27:01.850 --> 00:27:04.220
And now Aurash will
tell you about what Play

00:27:04.220 --> 00:27:06.440
does help your business grow.

00:27:06.440 --> 00:27:07.240
Thank you.

00:27:07.240 --> 00:27:13.350
[APPLAUSE]

00:27:13.350 --> 00:27:15.150
AURASH MAHBOD: Thank you.

00:27:15.150 --> 00:27:15.650
Awesome.

00:27:15.650 --> 00:27:16.275
Thanks, Milena.

00:27:21.850 --> 00:27:23.500
We've been focused
on building tools

00:27:23.500 --> 00:27:26.620
to help you grow your app,
retain users, and improve

00:27:26.620 --> 00:27:28.630
monetization.

00:27:28.630 --> 00:27:31.450
Every month, over 2 billion
users come to the Play store

00:27:31.450 --> 00:27:33.100
to discover new apps.

00:27:33.100 --> 00:27:35.445
That's 2 billion users
waiting to discover your app,

00:27:35.445 --> 00:27:36.820
and we want to
make sure you have

00:27:36.820 --> 00:27:38.770
the right tools and
the right support

00:27:38.770 --> 00:27:40.720
to reach every one of them.

00:27:40.720 --> 00:27:43.480
Today, I'm going to talk to
you about three key areas where

00:27:43.480 --> 00:27:45.910
Google Play can help
grow your business.

00:27:45.910 --> 00:27:49.150
First, optimizing
your store listing;

00:27:49.150 --> 00:27:53.740
second, driving games
discovery; and third improving

00:27:53.740 --> 00:27:55.580
monetization.

00:27:55.580 --> 00:27:58.480
So let's dive in
with star listings.

00:27:58.480 --> 00:28:01.960
Back in 2015, we launched
store listing experiments,

00:28:01.960 --> 00:28:04.210
enabling you to A/B
test different variants

00:28:04.210 --> 00:28:06.460
of your store listings page.

00:28:06.460 --> 00:28:08.770
We were excited to see how
quickly developers adopted

00:28:08.770 --> 00:28:12.340
this feature to test everything
from icons and screenshots

00:28:12.340 --> 00:28:14.035
to titles and descriptions.

00:28:14.035 --> 00:28:16.750
And we were even more
surprised to see developers

00:28:16.750 --> 00:28:19.480
hiring dedicated teams
to specifically focus

00:28:19.480 --> 00:28:21.790
on apps or optimization.

00:28:21.790 --> 00:28:23.890
Your enthusiasm and
feedback in this area

00:28:23.890 --> 00:28:25.240
led us to invest more.

00:28:25.240 --> 00:28:29.725
And so recently, we launched
custom listing pages.

00:28:29.725 --> 00:28:31.600
With this capability,
you now have the option

00:28:31.600 --> 00:28:33.220
of having multiple
unique listing

00:28:33.220 --> 00:28:35.650
pages in production targetable
to different audiences

00:28:35.650 --> 00:28:36.220
like country.

00:28:39.400 --> 00:28:42.280
Over the holidays,
Refi, a developer

00:28:42.280 --> 00:28:44.710
from India with a cookbook
app, leveraged this country

00:28:44.710 --> 00:28:47.170
targeting capability to
tune their featured graphic

00:28:47.170 --> 00:28:52.900
by country, resulting in a 17%
increase to install conversion.

00:28:52.900 --> 00:28:54.370
And today, I'm
excited to announce

00:28:54.370 --> 00:28:56.912
that we're taking this a step
further with a new early access

00:28:56.912 --> 00:28:58.300
program.

00:28:58.300 --> 00:29:01.210
Custom listings
by install state--

00:29:01.210 --> 00:29:02.830
with this capability,
you now can

00:29:02.830 --> 00:29:05.390
target three new audiences--

00:29:05.390 --> 00:29:07.630
users who have never
installed your app,

00:29:07.630 --> 00:29:09.760
users who've
uninstalled your app,

00:29:09.760 --> 00:29:13.128
and users who currently
have your app installed.

00:29:13.128 --> 00:29:14.170
We're excited about this.

00:29:14.170 --> 00:29:15.940
And if you're interested
in trying it out,

00:29:15.940 --> 00:29:16.732
check out the link.

00:29:19.030 --> 00:29:21.490
Also at GDC this
year, we announced

00:29:21.490 --> 00:29:25.420
the general availability
of preregistration support.

00:29:25.420 --> 00:29:26.950
With preregistration,
you can now

00:29:26.950 --> 00:29:29.470
build hype and excitement
around your app or game

00:29:29.470 --> 00:29:31.690
prior to launch.

00:29:31.690 --> 00:29:34.150
Today, we're adding two
new features onto this.

00:29:34.150 --> 00:29:37.000
First, you can now have
custom listings pages

00:29:37.000 --> 00:29:39.460
for the preregistration stage.

00:29:39.460 --> 00:29:41.500
And second, we're
adding a new feature

00:29:41.500 --> 00:29:44.020
we call pre registration
rewards, which

00:29:44.020 --> 00:29:46.130
now enables you to give
users who preregister

00:29:46.130 --> 00:29:49.300
a special in-app gift.

00:29:49.300 --> 00:29:52.080
Nexon the creator
of the game "Faith,"

00:29:52.080 --> 00:29:54.310
leverages this
capability and saw

00:29:54.310 --> 00:29:56.080
that users who
were given a reward

00:29:56.080 --> 00:30:00.130
were 20% more likely to
be retained at day 30.

00:30:00.130 --> 00:30:02.020
They also saw a
significant improvement

00:30:02.020 --> 00:30:04.920
in conversion between
people who preregistered

00:30:04.920 --> 00:30:08.735
and users who actually installed
the app and it was released.

00:30:08.735 --> 00:30:10.610
We're really excited
about these capabilities

00:30:10.610 --> 00:30:13.765
and see how you use them to
tune your conversion funnel.

00:30:13.765 --> 00:30:15.890
As always, please let us
know if you have feedback.

00:30:15.890 --> 00:30:18.437
We'd like not improve.

00:30:18.437 --> 00:30:21.020
And one last thing while we're
on the topic of that conversion

00:30:21.020 --> 00:30:25.940
funnel, I want to make a
quick plug for app icons.

00:30:25.940 --> 00:30:28.850
We announced the new icon
spec earlier this year,

00:30:28.850 --> 00:30:32.152
and we'd like everyone to
update their icons by June 24.

00:30:32.152 --> 00:30:33.860
The goal here is really
to provide a more

00:30:33.860 --> 00:30:35.510
clean and polished
user experience

00:30:35.510 --> 00:30:38.090
within the store for our users.

00:30:38.090 --> 00:30:40.610
For those of you who can't
make that date, don't stress--

00:30:40.610 --> 00:30:43.760
we have a great legacy mode that
keeps your icons looking good

00:30:43.760 --> 00:30:46.175
until you have time
to update them.

00:30:46.175 --> 00:30:48.050
OK, with that let's
switch gears a little bit

00:30:48.050 --> 00:30:51.050
and talk about games discovery.

00:30:51.050 --> 00:30:53.870
So I thought it'd be interesting
to give a little bit of context

00:30:53.870 --> 00:30:56.833
as we've been thinking about
this space for a long time.

00:30:56.833 --> 00:30:58.250
We had two key
insights that we're

00:30:58.250 --> 00:31:00.000
thinking about how to
evolve the discovery

00:31:00.000 --> 00:31:01.740
experience in the store.

00:31:01.740 --> 00:31:05.270
First, we realized that most
of the discovery experience

00:31:05.270 --> 00:31:08.270
is centered around a single
piece of metadata, your app

00:31:08.270 --> 00:31:09.267
icon.

00:31:09.267 --> 00:31:11.600
And while you all spend a lot
of time thinking about how

00:31:11.600 --> 00:31:14.930
to tune that icon to communicate
your brand, the IP of the game,

00:31:14.930 --> 00:31:17.160
the category, et cetera,
at the end of the day,

00:31:17.160 --> 00:31:19.077
there's a physical limit
with how much you can

00:31:19.077 --> 00:31:21.320
communicate with those pixels.

00:31:21.320 --> 00:31:22.970
The second
realization we had was

00:31:22.970 --> 00:31:24.950
that the deeper you go
into the user funnel,

00:31:24.950 --> 00:31:27.380
the closer you get the user
to the actual experience

00:31:27.380 --> 00:31:28.465
of playing the game.

00:31:28.465 --> 00:31:29.840
The more compelling
and rich that

00:31:29.840 --> 00:31:34.800
content is enabling users
to make informed choices.

00:31:34.800 --> 00:31:36.800
And as a result, we
really tried to push

00:31:36.800 --> 00:31:39.740
for a more content forward
experience in the Play Store.

00:31:39.740 --> 00:31:41.600
Drawing all of that
great rich content

00:31:41.600 --> 00:31:43.370
from the game, your
store listings page,

00:31:43.370 --> 00:31:46.313
and syndicating it
all across the store.

00:31:46.313 --> 00:31:48.230
And you can see examples
of this in production

00:31:48.230 --> 00:31:51.140
today with things like trailers
and screenshots, auto playing

00:31:51.140 --> 00:31:52.700
videos, and events.

00:31:52.700 --> 00:31:55.730
These formats are a great
way to attract new users

00:31:55.730 --> 00:31:57.420
and to be eligible for them.

00:31:57.420 --> 00:32:01.170
You just need to make sure
that you've done two things.

00:32:01.170 --> 00:32:03.950
First, you need to make sure
that you have at least three 16

00:32:03.950 --> 00:32:07.250
by 9 screenshots uploaded
to the developer console.

00:32:07.250 --> 00:32:10.280
And second, you need to check
that your promotional video

00:32:10.280 --> 00:32:15.500
has monetization disabled
and is made public.

00:32:15.500 --> 00:32:18.890
We also launched Google
Play Instant last year

00:32:18.890 --> 00:32:21.985
with the goal of furthering
this content forward experience.

00:32:21.985 --> 00:32:23.360
The goal here is
really to enable

00:32:23.360 --> 00:32:26.300
users to jump in and
try the game out,

00:32:26.300 --> 00:32:28.520
getting a quick feel for
it without having to commit

00:32:28.520 --> 00:32:31.100
to installing or uninstalling.

00:32:31.100 --> 00:32:33.260
And we've seen massive
growth in the adoption

00:32:33.260 --> 00:32:35.460
of instant, especially
amongst our largest,

00:32:35.460 --> 00:32:38.730
most successful partners
in the ecosystem.

00:32:38.730 --> 00:32:41.030
The number of instant
games has exploded--

00:32:41.030 --> 00:32:43.850
hundreds of them in the
store actually and developers

00:32:43.850 --> 00:32:47.150
are starting to see
great uplift here.

00:32:47.150 --> 00:32:48.740
Game developers
are seeing install

00:32:48.740 --> 00:32:51.110
conversions increased
by up to 20%

00:32:51.110 --> 00:32:52.880
with a great instant experience.

00:32:52.880 --> 00:32:55.760
And this is particularly
useful for paid apps and games

00:32:55.760 --> 00:32:59.960
where now you can enable try
before you buy functionality.

00:32:59.960 --> 00:33:02.060
As a result of
the success, we've

00:33:02.060 --> 00:33:05.030
expanded the footprint of
instant across the store

00:33:05.030 --> 00:33:07.870
by syndicating the Try
Now button everywhere.

00:33:07.870 --> 00:33:10.010
And with the advent
of the app bundle

00:33:10.010 --> 00:33:11.900
and improved
integration into Unity,

00:33:11.900 --> 00:33:13.670
adopting instant is
easier than ever.

00:33:17.620 --> 00:33:21.490
Lastly, we've been
focused on monetization.

00:33:21.490 --> 00:33:24.380
In the last year, we expanded
our international footprint,

00:33:24.380 --> 00:33:26.450
especially in emerging markets.

00:33:26.450 --> 00:33:29.400
We added seller support
to 31 new markets.

00:33:29.400 --> 00:33:32.180
We expanded our wallet
program to cover 14 countries,

00:33:32.180 --> 00:33:35.210
and we added 20 new direct
care, building partnerships

00:33:35.210 --> 00:33:36.710
our direct carrier
billing footprint

00:33:36.710 --> 00:33:39.920
alone reaches over 1.3
billion devices in the fleet,

00:33:39.920 --> 00:33:43.465
and that's just one of
our forms of payment.

00:33:43.465 --> 00:33:44.840
We know that
emerging markets are

00:33:44.840 --> 00:33:46.740
a key area of
growth for you all,

00:33:46.740 --> 00:33:50.370
which is why we're excited to
announce pending transactions.

00:33:50.370 --> 00:33:54.110
This is the new class of delayed
form of payment like cash, bank

00:33:54.110 --> 00:33:56.660
transfer, and direct debit.

00:33:56.660 --> 00:33:59.120
And for developers with
subscription businesses,

00:33:59.120 --> 00:34:01.430
we're extremely excited
about our subscribe

00:34:01.430 --> 00:34:03.410
and install feature.

00:34:03.410 --> 00:34:05.120
This features a
streamlined flow that

00:34:05.120 --> 00:34:06.950
lets the user sign
up for a free trial

00:34:06.950 --> 00:34:10.040
and install the app in
the same simple flow.

00:34:10.040 --> 00:34:12.110
It's an early access right
now, and our partners

00:34:12.110 --> 00:34:14.239
are seeing amazing
results with double digit

00:34:14.239 --> 00:34:18.510
growth in the number
of paid subscribers.

00:34:18.510 --> 00:34:21.090
All of these features
and more are only

00:34:21.090 --> 00:34:24.120
available with a new version
of the Billing Library.

00:34:24.120 --> 00:34:25.179
And I do mean and more.

00:34:25.179 --> 00:34:27.310
There was a lot I didn't
have time to cover today.

00:34:27.310 --> 00:34:29.880
So I highly recommend
checking out the deep dive

00:34:29.880 --> 00:34:32.931
but what's new in Google Play
billing session later today.

00:34:32.931 --> 00:34:34.889
And with that, I'd like
to welcome Purnima back

00:34:34.889 --> 00:34:35.650
to the stage.

00:34:35.650 --> 00:34:36.405
Thank you.

00:34:36.405 --> 00:34:39.877
[APPLAUSE]

00:34:44.850 --> 00:34:46.400
PURNIMA KOCHIKAR:
Thank you, Aurash.

00:34:46.400 --> 00:34:49.730
Wow that was a lot
of great stuff--

00:34:49.730 --> 00:34:51.400
yes.

00:34:51.400 --> 00:34:51.929
Oh, come on.

00:34:51.929 --> 00:34:53.420
You can do better than that.

00:34:53.420 --> 00:34:56.929
We worked very hard
for an entire year.

00:34:56.929 --> 00:34:59.570
We really, really
hope that you will

00:34:59.570 --> 00:35:02.210
use these features
to develop apps

00:35:02.210 --> 00:35:05.540
that can reach even
bigger audiences

00:35:05.540 --> 00:35:08.870
and release them and
track them and grow them

00:35:08.870 --> 00:35:11.520
into sustainable businesses.

00:35:11.520 --> 00:35:13.680
I know it's a lot
of information.

00:35:13.680 --> 00:35:16.520
So I want to share
two helpful resources.

00:35:16.520 --> 00:35:19.340
Behind me is a link
to a blog post, which

00:35:19.340 --> 00:35:22.260
will recap all the features
we have talked about.

00:35:22.260 --> 00:35:24.200
So please take a look
at the blog post.

00:35:24.200 --> 00:35:31.890
I'll give you a minute
I shiould move. aside.

00:35:31.890 --> 00:35:38.130
And we have this wonderful thing
called the Play Academy where

00:35:38.130 --> 00:35:41.070
you can go and learn all
details of all these features,

00:35:41.070 --> 00:35:43.110
learn how to use
them, et cetera.

00:35:43.110 --> 00:35:46.440
So please take a look
at the Play Academy,

00:35:46.440 --> 00:35:49.990
use it, so there is a link
to a Play Academy here.

00:35:54.220 --> 00:35:58.120
And finally, as
always, we sincerely

00:35:58.120 --> 00:35:59.980
hope you will let
us know once you've

00:35:59.980 --> 00:36:03.220
used it how these
features have helped you,

00:36:03.220 --> 00:36:05.380
things, we can improve.

00:36:05.380 --> 00:36:10.160
And we are here to listen and
do more with you together.

00:36:10.160 --> 00:36:13.720
I want to thank you on behalf
of Kobi, Milena, Aurash,

00:36:13.720 --> 00:36:15.940
and myself and the
entire Play team

00:36:15.940 --> 00:36:18.040
for your continued partnership.

00:36:18.040 --> 00:36:19.840
I am excited about
to see what you

00:36:19.840 --> 00:36:22.390
will do with the features
we shared with you today

00:36:22.390 --> 00:36:24.700
and look forward to
seeing you next year.

00:36:24.700 --> 00:36:27.760
Have a wonderful I/O 2019.

00:36:27.760 --> 00:36:29.530
Thank you very much.

00:36:29.530 --> 00:36:34.080
