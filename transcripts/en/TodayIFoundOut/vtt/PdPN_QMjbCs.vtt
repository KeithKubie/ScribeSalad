00:00:24.970 --> 00:00:28.769
Doug Engelbart is widely credited as the inventor
of the computer mouse.

00:00:28.769 --> 00:00:33.111
Of course, as with most inventions, nothing
happened in a vacuum and before the device

00:00:33.111 --> 00:00:37.750
that gave birth to the modern mouse was thought
up, there were several exceptionally similar

00:00:37.750 --> 00:00:38.980
devices around.

00:00:38.980 --> 00:00:42.940
For the full story of the invention of the
computer mouse, we’ll begin by backtracking

00:00:42.940 --> 00:00:47.829
slightly to a British engineer whose invention
was subsequently classified as a military

00:00:47.829 --> 00:00:50.350
secret and hidden from the public.

00:00:50.350 --> 00:00:55.170
That engineer was Professor Ralph Benjamin
who, while working for the Royal Navy Scientific

00:00:55.170 --> 00:01:00.180
Service, invented a device that functioned
in an almost identical fashion to a trackball

00:01:00.180 --> 00:01:03.189
mouse way back in the mid 1940s.

00:01:03.189 --> 00:01:09.170
According to a 2013 interview with Dr. Benjamin,
he was tasked by the Royal Navy with helping

00:01:09.170 --> 00:01:13.400
develop something called the Comprehensive
Display System, an early computer system that

00:01:13.400 --> 00:01:17.799
could calculate the theoretical trajectory
of monitored aircraft based on the inputs

00:01:17.799 --> 00:01:18.830
of a user.

00:01:18.830 --> 00:01:22.759
The cursor on the screen was controlled by
a simple joystick mechanism that Benjamin

00:01:22.759 --> 00:01:24.390
felt could be improved.

00:01:24.390 --> 00:01:28.430
After some tinkering, he came up with something
he dubbed the “Roller Ball” which functioned

00:01:28.430 --> 00:01:33.760
almost identically to a standard mechanical
mouse, with an outer ball that would in turn

00:01:33.760 --> 00:01:38.820
manipulate two rubber coated wheels inside,
one for the X axis and one for the Y.

00:01:38.820 --> 00:01:43.310
This movement was then translated into the
appropriate movement of the cursor on the

00:01:43.310 --> 00:01:44.310
screen.

00:01:44.310 --> 00:01:47.140
So why don’t people say the good professor
invented the mouse?

00:01:47.140 --> 00:01:50.280
Beyond that it wasn’t Benjamin’s device
that gave birth to the modern mouse, rather

00:01:50.280 --> 00:01:55.170
than having the desk or whatever object move
the ball via friction as one moves the mechanical

00:01:55.170 --> 00:02:00.170
mouse, in Benjamin’s device, your hand simply
directly moved the ball itself, with the top

00:02:00.170 --> 00:02:05.430
of the device exposing said ball- essentially
it was a large, upside down, stationary mechanical

00:02:05.430 --> 00:02:06.430
mouse.

00:02:06.430 --> 00:02:10.140
Although Benjamin’s device was more precise
than a joystick, it was never widely implemented

00:02:10.140 --> 00:02:14.670
and the Comprehensive Display System continued
to be controlled by said joystick.

00:02:14.670 --> 00:02:19.780
Due to its status as a military secret, Benjamin
received little to no credit for the invention

00:02:19.780 --> 00:02:25.420
of essentially a trackball mouse and he remains
an obscure figure in computing history, despite

00:02:25.420 --> 00:02:28.069
the innovative nature of the device he pioneered.

00:02:28.069 --> 00:02:32.950
canadian-mouseA similar device was also developed
independently of Benjamin’s design in 1952

00:02:32.950 --> 00:02:38.450
by a company, Ferranti Canada, working as
contractors for the Canadian Defence Research

00:02:38.450 --> 00:02:39.450
Board.

00:02:39.450 --> 00:02:43.260
The company was, amongst other things, tasked
with creating an input device for computers

00:02:43.260 --> 00:02:46.140
on a budget of “basically zero dollars”.

00:02:46.140 --> 00:02:50.670
Three engineers working for Ferranti, Tom
Cranston, Fred Longstaff and Kenyon Taylor,

00:02:50.670 --> 00:02:56.010
came up with the idea of using a ball housed
in a casing that remained in constant contact

00:02:56.010 --> 00:02:58.410
with four wheels positioned around it.

00:02:58.410 --> 00:03:02.590
When the ball was rolled in a given direction,
the movement of the wheels would be translated

00:03:02.590 --> 00:03:07.200
to corresponding cursor movements on the screen-
essentially this was a four-wheeled version

00:03:07.200 --> 00:03:08.990
of Benjamin’s device.

00:03:08.990 --> 00:03:13.110
As a testament to the low budget the engineers
had to work with, rather than constructing

00:03:13.110 --> 00:03:19.319
a trackball from scratch, they simply used
a 16 cm (about 6 inch) diameter five-pin bowling

00:03:19.319 --> 00:03:20.319
ball.

00:03:20.319 --> 00:03:23.849
Because the device was invented for the military,
it too was designed in secret.

00:03:23.849 --> 00:03:27.790
Ironically, in one notable way these, and
other similar trackball devices that were

00:03:27.790 --> 00:03:32.470
invented before the mouse, were more similar
to the once ubiquitous ball version of a mechanical

00:03:32.470 --> 00:03:34.879
mouse than Doug Engelbart’s first mouse.

00:03:34.879 --> 00:03:39.459
You see, Engelbart’s mouse didn’t use
a ball at all, instead having two perpendicular

00:03:39.459 --> 00:03:44.650
wheels directly contact the table instead
of using a ball to manipulate said wheels.

00:03:44.650 --> 00:03:48.599
While still functional, Engelbart’s design
had the downside of making it so one wheel

00:03:48.599 --> 00:03:52.069
was always at least partially being scraped
along the surface of the desk.

00:03:52.069 --> 00:03:54.690
But we’re getting ahead of ourselves a little.

00:03:54.690 --> 00:03:59.440
Engelbart developed what is the direct ancestor
of the modern mouse in the 1960s as part of

00:03:59.440 --> 00:04:04.150
an ongoing project to discover the most efficient
way to interact with a computer.

00:04:04.150 --> 00:04:08.380
Engelbart felt that the current devices in
use at the time, mainly keyboards, joysticks

00:04:08.380 --> 00:04:10.400
and light pens, were inefficient.

00:04:10.400 --> 00:04:14.269
With the help of engineer Bill English (who
designed the actual hardware for the first

00:04:14.269 --> 00:04:19.599
mouse based on Engelbart’s idea), he developed
a handheld device that housed two perpendicular

00:04:19.599 --> 00:04:23.220
wheels the movements of which would control
the on-screen cursor.

00:04:23.220 --> 00:04:27.530
Essentially, this more or less worked like
an upside down, hand held version of the two

00:04:27.530 --> 00:04:31.600
previously mentioned stationary trackball
devices, but without the ball.

00:04:31.600 --> 00:04:32.600
first-mouse
The First Mouse

00:04:32.600 --> 00:04:35.580
Engelbart thought up the idea for this device
in 1961.

00:04:35.580 --> 00:04:37.960
The first prototype was created by English
in 1964.

00:04:37.960 --> 00:04:43.990
In 1966, Engelbart and English approached
NASA asking them to fund a study to determine

00:04:43.990 --> 00:04:48.850
which input device was the most intuitive
and efficient for controlling a cursor.

00:04:48.850 --> 00:04:52.949
According to Engelbart, the devices proposed
to be tested, besides the mouse, were the

00:04:52.949 --> 00:04:55.949
“light pen… tracking ball and slider on
a pivot”.

00:04:55.949 --> 00:05:00.050
The space agency agreed and a series of tests
were carried out.

00:05:00.050 --> 00:05:04.490
Engelbart noted of the tests, “We set up
our experiments and the mouse won in every

00:05:04.490 --> 00:05:08.720
category, even though it had never been used
before [by the test subjects].

00:05:08.720 --> 00:05:11.900
It was faster, and with it people made fewer
mistakes.

00:05:11.900 --> 00:05:15.410
Five or six of us were involved in these tests,
but no one can remember who started calling

00:05:15.410 --> 00:05:16.410
it a mouse.

00:05:16.410 --> 00:05:17.560
I’m surprised the name stuck.”

00:05:17.560 --> 00:05:21.460
(Engelbart later explained it was called a
mouse due to the fact that initially they

00:05:21.460 --> 00:05:24.450
had the wire come out of the bottom like a
little tail.

00:05:24.450 --> 00:05:28.130
They switched it to the top to get around
one’s arm getting tangled in the cord all

00:05:28.130 --> 00:05:29.130
the time.)

00:05:29.130 --> 00:05:32.900
first_production_mouseAt the Fall Joint Computer
Conference in San Francisco on December 9,

00:05:32.900 --> 00:05:38.110
1968, Engelbart presented this mouse to over
a thousand computer engineers in one of the

00:05:38.110 --> 00:05:43.610
most influential computing presentations of
all time, later dubbed the The Mother of All

00:05:43.610 --> 00:05:44.610
Demos.

00:05:44.610 --> 00:05:48.870
Besides the mouse, Engelbart and his colleagues
also demonstrated in one system a number of

00:05:48.870 --> 00:05:54.139
revolutionary concepts that are now a staple
of modern computing, including hypertext,

00:05:54.139 --> 00:05:58.771
video conferencing via a high speed modem,
shared screens via a network (where control

00:05:58.771 --> 00:06:03.150
could be passed back and forth), a form of
windowed computing, word processing, real

00:06:03.150 --> 00:06:08.130
time digital text editing with multiple people
able to edit files at the same time (with

00:06:08.130 --> 00:06:11.400
revision control), and several other forms
of networked collaboration.

00:06:11.400 --> 00:06:15.870
Further, at a time when the idea of a personal
computer was a little outlandish, he also

00:06:15.870 --> 00:06:20.710
demoed how such a system could be used for
various personal computing needs, like maintaining

00:06:20.710 --> 00:06:25.169
a grocery list with robust organizational
features built into the word processor to

00:06:25.169 --> 00:06:26.430
manage such lists.

00:06:26.430 --> 00:06:29.550
(You can watch highlights of this phenomenal
time capsule of a presentation here.)

00:06:29.550 --> 00:06:33.479
Before the presentation, some who’d heard
of what Engelbart was working on had dubbed

00:06:33.479 --> 00:06:35.110
him a “crackpot”.

00:06:35.110 --> 00:06:39.580
After the presentation, Engelbart received
a standing ovation and was described by later

00:06:39.580 --> 00:06:45.030
Xerox PARC employee, Chuck Thacker, as “dealing
lightning in both hands”.

00:06:45.030 --> 00:06:48.949
However, demonstrating a system amazingly
far ahead of its time left some skeptical

00:06:48.949 --> 00:06:53.740
that his team’s “oNLine System” (NLS,
developed with funding from DARPA) could actually

00:06:53.740 --> 00:06:55.639
do what they’d demonstrated.

00:06:55.639 --> 00:07:01.139
One such individual was famed computer scientist
Andries van Dam, who furiously berated Engelbart

00:07:01.139 --> 00:07:05.440
after the presentation, stating, “It’s
irresponsible and unethical for you to show

00:07:05.440 --> 00:07:09.520
something you put together for a demo and
pretend it actually works!”

00:07:09.520 --> 00:07:12.889
To which Engelbart stated, “No, I told him,
it’s real.

00:07:12.889 --> 00:07:16.910
He just wouldn’t believe it until he got
to SRI and saw it for himself.”

00:07:16.910 --> 00:07:21.320
Despite very publicly debuting the mouse to
the best minds of the computing world in 1968,

00:07:21.320 --> 00:07:26.260
Engelbart’s part in its invention, and even
the monumental presentation itself that greatly

00:07:26.260 --> 00:07:30.759
influenced so much of the coming decades of
computer development, were largely forgotten.

00:07:30.759 --> 00:07:34.680
mouse-functionAnd so it was that, like so
many other inventors before him, Engelbart

00:07:34.680 --> 00:07:39.710
did not receive the credit for his invention
(initially), and Bill English even still receives

00:07:39.710 --> 00:07:41.270
little credit to this day.

00:07:41.270 --> 00:07:45.259
This, despite that fact that several years
later English would go on to invent the mechanical

00:07:45.259 --> 00:07:49.800
mouse that featured a ball to control the
X/Y wheels, which would become the general

00:07:49.800 --> 00:07:54.040
design of just about all mice until the rise
of things like optical mice.

00:07:54.040 --> 00:07:58.479
Beyond receiving little credit, because Engelbart
and English were working for Stanford Research

00:07:58.479 --> 00:08:03.210
Institute when they developed the first mouse,
the eventual patent that was granted for it

00:08:03.210 --> 00:08:05.310
in 1970 didn’t belong to them.

00:08:05.310 --> 00:08:09.710
Thus, the pair got no money for their invention
other than their normal paychecks.

00:08:09.710 --> 00:08:13.650
Stanford Research Institute reportedly did
make some money off the patent before it expired

00:08:13.650 --> 00:08:20.020
in 1984, for instance reportedly profiting
$40,000 ($130,000 today) when they licensed

00:08:20.020 --> 00:08:21.020
it to Apple.

00:08:21.020 --> 00:08:24.730
Speaking of Apple, the mouse as we know it
today rose from obscurity thanks to Steve

00:08:24.730 --> 00:08:30.389
Jobs being Steve Jobs- i.e. finding an existing
technology, hiring someone to copy it but

00:08:30.389 --> 00:08:35.169
with very subtle usability tweaks, geniously
marketing it, and then later getting much

00:08:35.169 --> 00:08:36.750
of the public credit for it.

00:08:36.750 --> 00:08:41.020
In this case, in 1979, Jobs agreed to give
Xerox a certain number of Apple shares in

00:08:41.020 --> 00:08:44.950
exchange for allowing him to come see what
Xerox’s Palo Alto Research Center (PARC)

00:08:44.950 --> 00:08:45.950
was working on.

00:08:45.950 --> 00:08:49.080
When Jobs went on a tour of the research centre,
he encountered a prototype version of the

00:08:49.080 --> 00:08:53.880
mouse (the ball-mechanical mouse invented
by Bill English, who was now working for Xerox

00:08:53.880 --> 00:08:54.880
PARC).

00:08:54.880 --> 00:08:56.390
Jobs recognised the potential of the device
immediately, and, according to Larry Tesler,

00:08:56.390 --> 00:08:59.070
the engineer who demonstrated the mouse to
Jobs, “He [Jobs] was very excited.

00:08:59.070 --> 00:09:02.749
Then, when he began seeing the things I could
do onscreen, he watched for about a minute

00:09:02.749 --> 00:09:06.920
and started jumping around the room, shouting,
‘Why aren’t you doing anything with this?

00:09:06.920 --> 00:09:08.480
This is the greatest thing.

00:09:08.480 --> 00:09:10.170
This is revolutionary!’”

00:09:10.170 --> 00:09:14.110
As it turns out, Xerox was doing something
with the device and had been selling the Xerox

00:09:14.110 --> 00:09:19.369
Alto along with a trackball mouse since 1973
and would later package it with the Xerox

00:09:19.369 --> 00:09:21.339
8010, released in 1981.

00:09:21.339 --> 00:09:24.949
However, higher ups in the company didn’t
seem to properly appreciated how innovative

00:09:24.949 --> 00:09:26.290
their system was.

00:09:26.290 --> 00:09:30.309
As Jobs would later note, “If Xerox had
known what it had and had taken advantage

00:09:30.309 --> 00:09:35.899
of its real opportunities, it could have been
as big as I.B.M. plus Microsoft plus Xerox

00:09:35.899 --> 00:09:39.920
combined—and the largest high-technology
company in the world.”

00:09:39.920 --> 00:09:43.730
Jobs, stunned at this lack of vision, rushed
back to Apple and had his team developing

00:09:43.730 --> 00:09:48.630
the next iteration of the company’s personal
computer line completely revamp their plans,

00:09:48.630 --> 00:09:52.779
demanding a window-based system with the mouse
as a key component.

00:09:52.779 --> 00:09:55.179
According to Dean Hovey, Jobs explained to
him later that week

00:09:55.179 --> 00:10:00.040
[The Xerox mouse] is a mouse that cost three
hundred dollars to build and it breaks within

00:10:00.040 --> 00:10:01.040
two weeks.

00:10:01.040 --> 00:10:04.670
Here’s your design spec: Our mouse needs
to be manufacturable for less than fifteen

00:10:04.670 --> 00:10:06.369
bucks (about $50 today).

00:10:06.369 --> 00:10:10.850
It needs to not fail for a couple of years,
and I want to be able to use it on Formica

00:10:10.850 --> 00:10:11.850
and my bluejeans.

00:10:11.850 --> 00:10:16.379
Hovey then explained, “From that meeting,
I went to Walgreens… and I wandered around

00:10:16.379 --> 00:10:20.290
and bought all the underarm deodorants that
I could find, because they had that ball in

00:10:20.290 --> 00:10:21.290
them.

00:10:21.290 --> 00:10:22.779
I bought a butter dish [for the body of the
mouse].

00:10:22.779 --> 00:10:25.360
That was the beginnings of the [Apple] mouse.”

00:10:25.360 --> 00:10:29.279
As for why the Apple mouse only had one button,
unlike other mice of the day (for instance,

00:10:29.279 --> 00:10:33.589
the original had three buttons, which after
much research Engelbert and his team determined

00:10:33.589 --> 00:10:37.589
was the ideal number), Hovey stated “There
were disputes around the number of buttons—three

00:10:37.589 --> 00:10:40.009
buttons, two buttons, one-button mouse.

00:10:40.009 --> 00:10:41.920
The mouse at Xerox had three buttons.

00:10:41.920 --> 00:10:46.980
But we came around to the fact that learning
to mouse is a feat in and of itself, and to

00:10:46.980 --> 00:10:50.800
make it as simple as possible, with just one
button, was pretty important.”

00:10:50.800 --> 00:10:55.850
Apple’s first take on the mouse came bundled
with the relatively obscure Apple Lisa computer.

00:10:55.850 --> 00:11:00.480
(This was named after Job’s daughter who
he denied was his until 1987, despite that

00:11:00.480 --> 00:11:05.470
a paternity test confirmed Lisa was his daughter
and she and her mother were living in poverty,

00:11:05.470 --> 00:11:08.040
while he simultaneously was naming Apple Lisa
after her).

00:11:08.040 --> 00:11:11.959
This first Apple mouse featured a steel ball
to drive the internal tracking wheels.

00:11:11.959 --> 00:11:15.860
The design was overhauled once again (notably
using a rubber ball) for the more popular

00:11:15.860 --> 00:11:20.230
Apple Macintosh computer released in 1984
which became one of the first commercially

00:11:20.230 --> 00:11:22.959
successful devices to make use of a mouse.

00:11:22.959 --> 00:11:27.449
Microsoft also came out with their own mouse
in 1983 for the PC, in-between Apple Lisa

00:11:27.449 --> 00:11:33.319
and the much more famous Macintosh 128K, but
it was the latter that subsequently spurred

00:11:33.319 --> 00:11:35.660
the widespread adoption of the mouse.

00:11:35.660 --> 00:11:39.059
After the success of the Macintosh, other
companies followed suit and the mouse became

00:11:39.059 --> 00:11:41.230
a staple of the personal computer.

00:11:41.230 --> 00:11:44.829
Despite many at various times over the decades
since predicting that the mouse would go the

00:11:44.829 --> 00:11:48.699
way of the Dodo “any day now” (most recently
because of the rise of the popularity of touch

00:11:48.699 --> 00:12:04.279
screens), the mouse is still going strong
with seemingly no real end 

00:12:04.279 --> 00:16:26.769
in sight.
