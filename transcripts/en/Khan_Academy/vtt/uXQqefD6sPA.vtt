00:00:00.236 --> 00:00:02.354
- [Voiceover] So, we were talking about

00:00:02.354 --> 00:00:05.502
the wealth inequality that
characterized the Gilded Age,

00:00:05.502 --> 00:00:08.484
but you were telling me that
that's not the only thing,

00:00:08.484 --> 00:00:11.047
Kim, that characterizes this period.

00:00:11.047 --> 00:00:14.781
- [Voiceover] Right, what really
makes the Gilded Age happen

00:00:14.781 --> 00:00:18.864
is what we call the Second
Industrial Revolution.

00:00:20.629 --> 00:00:24.028
Are you familiar with the
First Industrial Revolution?

00:00:24.028 --> 00:00:25.477
- [Voiceover] But, of course.

00:00:25.477 --> 00:00:27.372
- [Voiceover] So, that was the revolution

00:00:27.372 --> 00:00:30.465
where they had steamships and canals

00:00:30.465 --> 00:00:32.749
and kinda this early creation

00:00:32.749 --> 00:00:34.895
of the market system in the United States,

00:00:34.895 --> 00:00:36.645
say like 1820s-1830s.

00:00:37.486 --> 00:00:39.437
The Second Industrial Revolution

00:00:39.437 --> 00:00:43.604
is more of a revolution of
mass production, I would say,

00:00:45.093 --> 00:00:49.176
and ways of making and
shipping and communicating

00:00:52.171 --> 00:00:55.124
about business transactions and materials

00:00:55.124 --> 00:00:56.406
that didn't exist before.

00:00:56.406 --> 00:00:57.994
- [Voiceover] So, what are some of these

00:00:57.994 --> 00:01:02.480
disruptive technologies (Kim
laughs) that are really poised

00:01:02.480 --> 00:01:04.904
to change the shipment paradigm?

00:01:04.904 --> 00:01:08.137
So, okay, so off the top of my head,

00:01:08.137 --> 00:01:11.508
trains probably a huge
deal in this period?

00:01:11.508 --> 00:01:12.341
- [Voiceover] Yes.

00:01:12.341 --> 00:01:14.701
- [Voiceover] So, we've
got all this coal going

00:01:14.701 --> 00:01:17.460
and that means that there's
a lot of smelting happening

00:01:17.460 --> 00:01:18.381
and that means that there's also

00:01:18.381 --> 00:01:20.156
a lot of steel happening too.

00:01:20.156 --> 00:01:21.270
- [Voiceover] Steel.

00:01:21.270 --> 00:01:25.437
I think if I had to choose
one most important technology

00:01:27.372 --> 00:01:30.382
of the Gilded Age, it
would have to be steel.

00:01:30.382 --> 00:01:32.524
Now, it's not like steel didn't
actually exist before this.

00:01:32.524 --> 00:01:35.223
- [Voiceover] Right, steel
had been around for millennia.

00:01:35.223 --> 00:01:36.056
- [Voiceover] Yeah, I think so.

00:01:36.056 --> 00:01:37.504
- [Voiceover] Millennium.

00:01:37.504 --> 00:01:39.399
- [Voiceover] But, what
happens in this time period

00:01:39.399 --> 00:01:41.572
is there's a new process for making steel.

00:01:41.572 --> 00:01:44.637
It's called the Bessemer process.

00:01:44.637 --> 00:01:48.594
And the Bessemer process
basically makes steel faster

00:01:48.594 --> 00:01:51.269
and it makes it cheaper.

00:01:51.269 --> 00:01:54.776
And in this time period,
Andrew Carnegie we talked about

00:01:54.776 --> 00:01:57.005
being this major steel baron,

00:01:57.005 --> 00:01:59.011
railroads throughout the United States,

00:01:59.011 --> 00:02:03.135
partly supported, majorly
supported by the U.S. government.

00:02:03.135 --> 00:02:06.885
And during this period,
they lay 40,000 miles

00:02:08.011 --> 00:02:09.509
of new tracks of rail.

00:02:09.509 --> 00:02:11.067
- [Voiceover] That is so many miles.

00:02:11.067 --> 00:02:12.312
- [Voiceover] That is so many miles.

00:02:12.312 --> 00:02:13.785
- [Voiceover] How long
is the United States

00:02:13.785 --> 00:02:15.286
from Los Angeles to New York? (Kim laughs)

00:02:15.286 --> 00:02:16.875
Like 3,000 miles?

00:02:16.875 --> 00:02:18.348
3,100 miles?

00:02:18.348 --> 00:02:19.181
- [Voiceover] Yes.

00:02:19.181 --> 00:02:22.328
So, just imagine a nation
where most railroad tracks

00:02:22.328 --> 00:02:25.226
had gone through sort of
the eastern coastal cities

00:02:25.226 --> 00:02:26.954
up until 1865.

00:02:26.954 --> 00:02:29.824
Now, the entire country
is connected by rail.

00:02:29.824 --> 00:02:34.226
There's more rail in the
United States in 1900

00:02:34.226 --> 00:02:36.372
than all of Europe combined.

00:02:36.372 --> 00:02:39.604
- [Voiceover] So, the Bessemer
process of making steel

00:02:39.604 --> 00:02:41.527
is this foundational technology

00:02:41.527 --> 00:02:43.756
that enables a lot of
the Gilded Age to happen.

00:02:43.756 --> 00:02:45.734
- [Voiceover] Right, so it
enables the United States

00:02:45.734 --> 00:02:49.189
to move out and also to connect markets.

00:02:49.189 --> 00:02:52.477
So, you can now take raw
materials from the West,

00:02:52.477 --> 00:02:55.319
which is really important,
that's where the gold lives

00:02:55.319 --> 00:02:57.744
and also cattle ranching,

00:02:57.744 --> 00:03:00.753
you take those things from the West,

00:03:00.753 --> 00:03:04.372
you take them to the
cities to be processed.

00:03:04.372 --> 00:03:06.573
Then, you take the finished goods

00:03:06.573 --> 00:03:10.223
and send them back out
into the smaller towns.

00:03:10.223 --> 00:03:12.452
So, rail facilitates all of that.

00:03:12.452 --> 00:03:16.130
- [Voiceover] So, this is how
my hometown became notorious--

00:03:16.130 --> 00:03:16.963
- [Voiceover] Yeah.

00:03:16.963 --> 00:03:17.796
- [Voiceover] of Chicago.

00:03:17.796 --> 00:03:19.080
So, there would be cattle
drives, I guess then,

00:03:19.080 --> 00:03:20.692
that came from the West

00:03:20.692 --> 00:03:22.026
and then they would all be slaughtered

00:03:22.026 --> 00:03:23.644
and processed in Chicago.

00:03:23.644 --> 00:03:25.171
- [Voiceover] Right, yeah.

00:03:25.171 --> 00:03:27.874
I'm a native Pennsylvanian,
you're a native Chicagoan,

00:03:27.874 --> 00:03:30.744
and we are born from steel places,

00:03:30.744 --> 00:03:35.342
as the steel industry really
grew up in Pittsburgh.

00:03:35.342 --> 00:03:37.403
And what I think is really
interesting about steel too

00:03:37.403 --> 00:03:41.026
is that it's like a
self-sustaining industry

00:03:41.026 --> 00:03:45.109
because you need the steel
to make the railroads.

00:03:47.100 --> 00:03:49.683
And then, the railroad industry

00:03:50.918 --> 00:03:54.289
pays for the creation of steel,

00:03:54.289 --> 00:03:58.274
which facilitates the
creation of more railroads,

00:03:58.274 --> 00:04:00.921
which necessitates the
creation of more steel

00:04:00.921 --> 00:04:03.345
and it's just like this never-ending boom

00:04:03.345 --> 00:04:05.072
in steel in the Gilded Age.

00:04:05.072 --> 00:04:09.754
So, steel facilitates the
United States moving outward,

00:04:09.754 --> 00:04:13.041
but it also facilitates the
United States moving upward.

00:04:13.041 --> 00:04:13.874
- [Voiceover] Oh, I see what you did.

00:04:13.874 --> 00:04:14.707
That was good.

00:04:14.707 --> 00:04:15.540
- [Voiceover] Yeah, you like that?

00:04:15.540 --> 00:04:16.373
- [Voiceover] Yeah.

00:04:16.373 --> 00:04:19.240
- [Voiceover] So, steel
allows for the construction

00:04:19.240 --> 00:04:22.084
of buildings that are
taller than ever before.

00:04:22.084 --> 00:04:23.500
- [Voiceover] So, what
is this building here?

00:04:23.500 --> 00:04:24.333
- [Voiceover] This building here

00:04:24.333 --> 00:04:27.059
is the Home Insurance Building in Chicago.

00:04:27.059 --> 00:04:30.375
I don't believe it is there anymore.

00:04:30.375 --> 00:04:31.740
And do you know what is special

00:04:31.740 --> 00:04:33.273
about the Home Insurance Building?

00:04:33.273 --> 00:04:34.638
- [Voiceover] No, what's special about it?

00:04:34.638 --> 00:04:36.028
- [Voiceover] The Home
Insurance Building is considered

00:04:36.028 --> 00:04:37.783
to be the world's first skyscraper.

00:04:37.783 --> 00:04:39.005
- [Voiceover] What?! Awesome!

00:04:39.005 --> 00:04:40.674
- [Voiceover] Yeah, it looks pretty short

00:04:40.674 --> 00:04:42.704
for a skyscraper by modern standards.

00:04:42.704 --> 00:04:44.822
- [Voiceover] I mean, I couldn't
build a building that tall.

00:04:44.822 --> 00:04:46.772
- [Voiceover] That's 10 stories tall.

00:04:46.772 --> 00:04:48.751
And what you can do with steel

00:04:48.751 --> 00:04:52.918
is build these steel-frame
structures that allow you,

00:04:54.543 --> 00:04:58.710
without using stone, there's
kind of like a steel cage

00:05:00.533 --> 00:05:03.097
underneath the facade of this.

00:05:03.097 --> 00:05:05.605
And so, you can build buildings

00:05:05.605 --> 00:05:08.688
that are taller while having windows.

00:05:10.202 --> 00:05:11.345
- [Voiceover] It's like a Faraday cage.

00:05:11.345 --> 00:05:13.211
I bet there was terrible
cellphone reception in there.

00:05:13.211 --> 00:05:14.772
- [Voiceover] I imagine so, yeah.

00:05:14.772 --> 00:05:16.388
There were no cellphones at this time.

00:05:16.388 --> 00:05:18.116
All right, so you know what else

00:05:18.116 --> 00:05:19.592
made these tall buildings possible

00:05:19.592 --> 00:05:21.682
except for the steel structures?

00:05:21.682 --> 00:05:22.515
- [Voiceover] Was it elevators?

00:05:22.515 --> 00:05:23.856
- [Voiceover] It was totally elevators.

00:05:23.856 --> 00:05:24.886
- [Voiceover] Yes!

00:05:24.886 --> 00:05:26.419
- [Voiceover] Yes, see, you're better

00:05:26.419 --> 00:05:27.366
at this than you thought.

00:05:27.366 --> 00:05:28.369
- [Voiceover] Yeah!

00:05:28.369 --> 00:05:29.508
- [Voiceover] This is the time

00:05:29.508 --> 00:05:32.378
of the invention of the Otis elevator,

00:05:32.378 --> 00:05:34.635
and this is my little
elevator entrance, that--

00:05:34.635 --> 00:05:35.471
- [Voiceover] Nice!

00:05:35.471 --> 00:05:37.808
- [Voiceover] You could go
to the top of a tall building

00:05:37.808 --> 00:05:40.817
without having to walk
up 37 flights of stairs,

00:05:40.817 --> 00:05:43.046
which is pretty sweet for our efficiency,

00:05:43.046 --> 00:05:44.690
if not maybe our waistlines.

00:05:44.690 --> 00:05:47.059
- [Voiceover] Okay, so, but
we've got this steel process

00:05:47.059 --> 00:05:50.765
which enable the construction
of tons and tons of rail

00:05:50.765 --> 00:05:54.750
and tons and tons of
buildings, of new buildings

00:05:54.750 --> 00:05:58.141
where you can put more
industry and more people.

00:05:58.141 --> 00:06:01.624
And that enable cities to
grow and wealth to grow.

00:06:01.624 --> 00:06:02.906
- [Voiceover] Yeah, exactly.

00:06:02.906 --> 00:06:05.525
So, there are more and more
people flooding into cities.

00:06:05.525 --> 00:06:08.025
By 1870, there are more people

00:06:09.064 --> 00:06:12.519
working for other people
for wages living in cities

00:06:12.519 --> 00:06:14.470
than people who work for themselves,

00:06:14.470 --> 00:06:18.900
which is a new era in the
American economic system.

00:06:18.900 --> 00:06:22.467
There's some other really
important business technologies

00:06:22.467 --> 00:06:24.166
that grow up in this time period as well.

00:06:24.166 --> 00:06:26.333
So, there's the telephone,

00:06:29.600 --> 00:06:32.498
which makes it possible to do

00:06:32.498 --> 00:06:36.038
business transactions on the spot.

00:06:36.038 --> 00:06:38.453
It revolutionized the speed of business

00:06:38.453 --> 00:06:40.209
very much the same way that the internet

00:06:40.209 --> 00:06:44.026
is gonna revolutionize the
speed of business in the 1990s.

00:06:44.026 --> 00:06:47.648
You also have refrigeration,
which you would not think

00:06:47.648 --> 00:06:49.961
would be that big of a deal,

00:06:49.961 --> 00:06:54.128
but think about how it
allows you to move foodstuffs

00:06:55.255 --> 00:06:56.983
all over the country to new markets.

00:06:56.983 --> 00:06:59.097
You were just talking
about Chicago, right?

00:06:59.097 --> 00:07:02.580
So, the only way that cattle
could be driven into Chicago,

00:07:02.580 --> 00:07:04.809
slaughtered, and then have meat sent

00:07:04.809 --> 00:07:07.010
to all the other markets
in the United States

00:07:07.010 --> 00:07:09.128
was through refrigerated train cars.

00:07:09.128 --> 00:07:10.995
And they have similar
things for steamships

00:07:10.995 --> 00:07:12.444
that allow people to, for example,

00:07:12.444 --> 00:07:14.868
bring oranges from Florida to New York.

00:07:14.868 --> 00:07:17.375
So, it's this web of markets

00:07:17.375 --> 00:07:19.577
that are connecting the United States,

00:07:19.577 --> 00:07:22.244
and this is my terrible
drawing of the United States,

00:07:22.244 --> 00:07:25.577
but rail and then ships make it possible

00:07:28.176 --> 00:07:32.104
for all of these markets
to connect together

00:07:32.104 --> 00:07:34.262
over time and over space.

00:07:34.262 --> 00:07:35.236
- [Voiceover] That's super cool.

00:07:35.236 --> 00:07:37.711
- [Voiceover] You know, the
railroad was even so important

00:07:37.711 --> 00:07:39.856
in this time period that, in a way,

00:07:39.856 --> 00:07:43.312
it invented the modern system of time.

00:07:43.312 --> 00:07:46.098
Because before the railroad,

00:07:46.098 --> 00:07:48.745
localities would just decide when noon was

00:07:48.745 --> 00:07:51.253
based on when the sun
was highest in the sky,

00:07:51.253 --> 00:07:52.086
which meant that--

00:07:52.086 --> 00:07:53.363
- [Voiceover] It didn't
matter whether or not

00:07:53.363 --> 00:07:56.985
it was the same time in
Kansas City as in St. Louis.

00:07:56.985 --> 00:07:59.549
But once you have a train connecting 'em,

00:07:59.549 --> 00:08:02.029
the St. Louis train gets in at 12:05,

00:08:02.029 --> 00:08:03.951
if you're off, you'll miss your train.

00:08:03.951 --> 00:08:07.156
- [Voiceover] Or that might
lead to a collision of trains

00:08:07.156 --> 00:08:08.629
if they don't know when the other train

00:08:08.629 --> 00:08:09.990
is going to be coming through.

00:08:09.990 --> 00:08:11.077
- [Voiceover] Yeah, okay.

00:08:11.077 --> 00:08:13.497
So, inventions of the Gilded Age:

00:08:13.497 --> 00:08:17.426
intranational train travel, the telephone,

00:08:17.426 --> 00:08:20.101
refrigeration for meat, the
Bessemer process for steel,

00:08:20.101 --> 00:08:21.968
and the standardization of time.

00:08:21.968 --> 00:08:23.445
- [Voiceover] All of those things.

00:08:23.445 --> 00:08:24.755
And I would say the last thing

00:08:24.755 --> 00:08:27.931
that might be really important
here is also electrification.

00:08:27.931 --> 00:08:29.352
- [Voiceover] Oooh!

00:08:29.352 --> 00:08:32.939
- [Voiceover] Yeah, and like steel,

00:08:32.939 --> 00:08:35.781
electricity was not
invented in the Gilded Age,

00:08:35.781 --> 00:08:39.567
but what happened was the
spread of the light bulb

00:08:39.567 --> 00:08:41.963
in both homes and businesses,

00:08:41.963 --> 00:08:44.861
which meant that you
could work longer hours.

00:08:44.861 --> 00:08:45.944
You didn't sleep as long.

00:08:45.944 --> 00:08:49.061
Actually, the amount of sleep
that people got per night

00:08:49.061 --> 00:08:52.489
switched from about nine
hours before electrification

00:08:52.489 --> 00:08:54.328
to about seven hours after.

00:08:54.328 --> 00:08:56.557
So, Thomas Edison is literally responsible

00:08:56.557 --> 00:08:58.034
for robbing us of sleep.

00:08:58.034 --> 00:08:59.674
But it also made it possible

00:08:59.674 --> 00:09:02.014
for workers to work longer hours

00:09:02.014 --> 00:09:06.181
and it significantly reduced
the risk of fire in businesses,

00:09:07.727 --> 00:09:10.401
which meant you could invest
in them with more confidence.

00:09:10.401 --> 00:09:12.129
- [Voiceover] Oh, because
they didn't have gas lamps

00:09:12.129 --> 00:09:13.244
that could burst into flame.

00:09:13.244 --> 00:09:14.077
- [Voiceover] Right.

00:09:14.077 --> 00:09:15.967
- [Voiceover] Awesome,
well that's super cool.

00:09:15.967 --> 00:09:17.945
So, hooray Gilded Age, right?

00:09:17.945 --> 00:09:18.948
- [Voiceover] Right.

00:09:18.948 --> 00:09:22.626
And I think one thing that's
important to understand

00:09:22.626 --> 00:09:27.113
about these technologies
is that one of the goals

00:09:27.113 --> 00:09:29.927
of these technologies
was to make it possible

00:09:29.927 --> 00:09:32.017
to produce things faster,

00:09:32.017 --> 00:09:36.885
but also to produce them
with less-skilled workers,

00:09:36.885 --> 00:09:40.870
because a skilled worker,
someone who knows a craft

00:09:40.870 --> 00:09:44.771
and can produce a finished
item from start to finish,

00:09:44.771 --> 00:09:47.554
that takes a long time and
it costs a lot of money.

00:09:47.554 --> 00:09:50.842
This is the difference between
buying a suit off the rack

00:09:50.842 --> 00:09:52.792
and having a bespoke suit.

00:09:52.792 --> 00:09:56.076
If you wanna pay someone
for that time and talent,

00:09:56.076 --> 00:09:57.692
you're gonna pay a lot.

00:09:57.692 --> 00:10:00.590
But if you can make
something on a machine,

00:10:00.590 --> 00:10:03.739
then you can make a lot
of them very quickly

00:10:03.739 --> 00:10:08.444
and you don't need someone
who is an expert tailor.

00:10:08.444 --> 00:10:11.008
You just need someone who
can operate a sewing machine

00:10:11.008 --> 00:10:13.571
to do a couple of seams.

00:10:13.571 --> 00:10:16.971
So, what they're trying to
do here with this innovation

00:10:16.971 --> 00:10:19.646
is spread consumer goods,

00:10:19.646 --> 00:10:21.986
spread a higher standard of living.

00:10:21.986 --> 00:10:24.773
But they're also doing that at the price

00:10:24.773 --> 00:10:28.932
of having less-skilled workers
making much smaller wages.
