just talk briefly then yes about

00:01:49.879 --> 00:01:49.889
just talk briefly then yes about
 

00:01:49.889 --> 00:01:54.469
just talk briefly then yes about

market to address climate change if you
make extra carbon you pay more fee if

00:02:04.249 --> 00:02:04.259
make extra carbon you pay more fee if
 

00:02:04.259 --> 00:02:06.410
make extra carbon you pay more fee if
you reduce your carbon you pay less fee

00:02:06.410 --> 00:02:06.420
you reduce your carbon you pay less fee
 

00:02:06.420 --> 00:02:09.080

so here's what I say to those of you who

00:02:09.080 --> 00:02:09.090
so here's what I say to those of you who
 

00:02:09.090 --> 00:02:11.410
so here's what I say to those of you who
think it just can't possibly be done oh

00:02:11.410 --> 00:02:11.420
think it just can't possibly be done oh
