TIMOTHY JORDAN:
I'm Timothy Jordan,

00:00:05.250 --> 00:00:07.890
and we're honored to have
renowned artist Sougwen Chung

00:00:07.890 --> 00:00:09.300
here to talk about her work.

00:00:09.300 --> 00:00:09.975
Welcome.

00:00:09.975 --> 00:00:10.728
SOUGWEN CHUNG: Hi.

00:00:10.728 --> 00:00:12.270
TIMOTHY JORDAN: Now
I've been looking

00:00:12.270 --> 00:00:13.937
forward to your
performance here at I/O.

00:00:13.937 --> 00:00:15.400
And I'd like to talk about it.

00:00:15.400 --> 00:00:17.400
But first how about
some background?

00:00:17.400 --> 00:00:20.575
When did you start working
with robots and why?

00:00:20.575 --> 00:00:22.200
SOUGWEN CHUNG: That's
a great question.

00:00:22.200 --> 00:00:23.910
I get asked that all the time.

00:00:23.910 --> 00:00:26.880
I started working with
robots about five years ago.

00:00:26.880 --> 00:00:29.100
I've been kind of
a digital nomad.

00:00:29.100 --> 00:00:31.350
I learned to code when
I was quite young.

00:00:31.350 --> 00:00:34.080
And I got really
interested in ways

00:00:34.080 --> 00:00:38.880
to take what's present inside
the simulation of the computer

00:00:38.880 --> 00:00:40.180
into the physical world.

00:00:40.180 --> 00:00:44.850
So I started with a really
simple drawing collaboration

00:00:44.850 --> 00:00:46.320
with my first robotic arm.

00:00:46.320 --> 00:00:48.905
And it's just taken
off ever since.

00:00:48.905 --> 00:00:51.090
TIMOTHY JORDAN: How has
the experience of, say,

00:00:51.090 --> 00:00:53.010
human machine
collaboration changed

00:00:53.010 --> 00:00:54.390
your process as an artist?

00:00:54.390 --> 00:00:56.850
SOUGWEN CHUNG: You know,
I think about that a lot.

00:00:56.850 --> 00:01:00.660
Because I think it has changed
it quite significantly.

00:01:00.660 --> 00:01:05.863
I've gotten more accustomed
to chaos, to put it mildly.

00:01:05.863 --> 00:01:08.030
TIMOTHY JORDAN: Things going
not the way you expect?

00:01:08.030 --> 00:01:11.520
SOUGWEN CHUNG: Yeah, there's
a lot of erratic emergent

00:01:11.520 --> 00:01:14.820
behavior or assigned
attributed behavior

00:01:14.820 --> 00:01:18.660
to working with these
machines that really got me

00:01:18.660 --> 00:01:21.390
outside of my comfort
zone from just

00:01:21.390 --> 00:01:22.860
my simple drawing practice.

00:01:22.860 --> 00:01:28.980
I think there's something
really gestural and cognitive

00:01:28.980 --> 00:01:30.360
about mark making.

00:01:30.360 --> 00:01:34.770
That when you do that with a
robotic articulated unit it--

00:01:34.770 --> 00:01:37.080
yeah, there's a lot
of new surprises.

00:01:37.080 --> 00:01:39.330
I'd like to think of
working with these machines

00:01:39.330 --> 00:01:41.340
as a creative catalyst.

00:01:41.340 --> 00:01:43.500
So that ends up being
quite inspiring for me.

00:01:43.500 --> 00:01:45.000
TIMOTHY JORDAN: Interesting.

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:46.645
All right, let's talk about
the performance a little bit.

00:01:46.645 --> 00:01:47.360
SOUGWEN CHUNG: Sure, yeah.

00:01:47.360 --> 00:01:49.155
TIMOTHY JORDAN: Now, it
was beautiful and elegant.

00:01:49.155 --> 00:01:50.400
SOUGWEN CHUNG: Thank you.

00:01:50.400 --> 00:01:52.233
TIMOTHY JORDAN: I
expected that part, right?

00:01:52.233 --> 00:01:53.910
Because I looked at
your work online.

00:01:53.910 --> 00:01:56.250
What I didn't expect was
something completely different.

00:01:56.250 --> 00:02:00.140
That your relationship
with the robots felt--

00:02:00.140 --> 00:02:02.250
if I can say--
gentle and familial,

00:02:02.250 --> 00:02:03.320
like they were family.

00:02:03.320 --> 00:02:06.377
SOUGWEN CHUNG: Yeah, they
pretty much are at this point.

00:02:06.377 --> 00:02:08.169
TIMOTHY JORDAN: I mean,
tell me about that.

00:02:08.169 --> 00:02:11.520
How much of what you're
doing about the art

00:02:11.520 --> 00:02:15.105
is about that relationship
rather than the marks

00:02:15.105 --> 00:02:16.290
that you're making?

00:02:16.290 --> 00:02:17.680
SOUGWEN CHUNG: Yeah, definitely.

00:02:17.680 --> 00:02:20.910
So I implicate the
tool as a collaborator.

00:02:20.910 --> 00:02:23.400
And I think I frame
it as a collaboration

00:02:23.400 --> 00:02:29.280
because we want to facilitate
kind, generous collaborations

00:02:29.280 --> 00:02:31.930
in the world between
humans to humans.

00:02:31.930 --> 00:02:35.590
And I think when I regard these
machines as my collaborators

00:02:35.590 --> 00:02:40.470
it's a way of just creating
a more empathetic model.

00:02:40.470 --> 00:02:44.430
In this context it's
behavioral empathy.

00:02:44.430 --> 00:02:48.420
But when I'm onstage
performing with these robots

00:02:48.420 --> 00:02:54.970
I think it's very much me and
them and this captive audience.

00:02:54.970 --> 00:02:59.470
And that mutual
reliance and co-creation

00:02:59.470 --> 00:03:03.820
ends up spurring a very
emotional connection with them.

00:03:03.820 --> 00:03:06.830
And I think that we've evolved--

00:03:06.830 --> 00:03:09.110
like, my process has
evolved significantly

00:03:09.110 --> 00:03:10.760
with this collaborative work.

00:03:10.760 --> 00:03:13.760
And they have as well.

00:03:13.760 --> 00:03:18.770
I think it's a positive way
of slanting anthropomorphism

00:03:18.770 --> 00:03:21.305
that's just been really
inspiring for the work.

00:03:21.305 --> 00:03:23.308
TIMOTHY JORDAN: Did
you have to do anything

00:03:23.308 --> 00:03:25.100
to build that relationship
like hanging out

00:03:25.100 --> 00:03:26.742
with them outside of work?

00:03:26.742 --> 00:03:30.950
SOUGWEN CHUNG: Yeah, we get a
few beers every now and then.

00:03:30.950 --> 00:03:35.000
Honestly there's so much
vitality and vulnerability when

00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:40.400
doing these performances that
we've kind of been in this

00:03:40.400 --> 00:03:43.310
together-- with the risk
of sounding a bit cheesy--

00:03:43.310 --> 00:03:46.580
has made it feel like a
really close connection.

00:03:46.580 --> 00:03:49.220
In addition to the
robotic arms I've

00:03:49.220 --> 00:03:51.980
been designing a multi-robotic
system that's actually

00:03:51.980 --> 00:03:55.130
a series of 20
painting robots that

00:03:55.130 --> 00:03:59.120
also is a articulation
of this robotic form

00:03:59.120 --> 00:04:00.680
in a different way.

00:04:00.680 --> 00:04:02.930
Instead of one to
one it's one to many.

00:04:02.930 --> 00:04:05.060
And that is a totally
different relationship.

00:04:05.060 --> 00:04:09.190
It's almost like a natural swarm
that I'm really excited about.

00:04:09.190 --> 00:04:11.120
So that reframes the
relationship too.

00:04:11.120 --> 00:04:15.020
And it's like embodied
kinetic sculpture.

00:04:15.020 --> 00:04:18.454
That's only possible
in today's moment.

00:04:18.454 --> 00:04:19.579
And that really excites me.

00:04:19.579 --> 00:04:20.510
TIMOTHY JORDAN:
That's really cool.

00:04:20.510 --> 00:04:21.590
SOUGWEN CHUNG: Thanks.

00:04:21.590 --> 00:04:23.810
TIMOTHY JORDAN: OK,
the themes of the work

00:04:23.810 --> 00:04:25.760
that you performed here.

00:04:25.760 --> 00:04:29.600
Mimicry, memory, and
future speculations.

00:04:29.600 --> 00:04:31.010
How did you land on those?

00:04:31.010 --> 00:04:35.150
SOUGWEN CHUNG: So the mimicry
was the first generation.

00:04:35.150 --> 00:04:38.570
I call my robots Doug.

00:04:38.570 --> 00:04:41.150
Because the project is named--

00:04:41.150 --> 00:04:44.930
let's just drop the formalities
and call them what they are.

00:04:44.930 --> 00:04:49.070
I started the project and it's
called Drawing Operations Unit

00:04:49.070 --> 00:04:51.830
Generation One was
focused on mimicry.

00:04:51.830 --> 00:04:55.060
And that was DOUG One.

00:04:55.060 --> 00:04:58.670
And it's sort of
grown over time.

00:04:58.670 --> 00:05:02.630
It's mimicry, memory,
and future speculations

00:05:02.630 --> 00:05:06.890
because those are the three
chapters of this evolving

00:05:06.890 --> 00:05:08.630
generational project.

00:05:08.630 --> 00:05:11.000
So I'm really excited
about the third.

00:05:11.000 --> 00:05:14.390
Because it shows
multi-robotic collaboration

00:05:14.390 --> 00:05:17.970
alongside my human
drawing agency.

00:05:17.970 --> 00:05:19.970
And that's very much
where the work is headed.

00:05:19.970 --> 00:05:24.197
Towards a more collaborative,
more collective idea.

00:05:24.197 --> 00:05:26.030
TIMOTHY JORDAN: Is there
a fourth generation

00:05:26.030 --> 00:05:26.600
you have in mind?

00:05:26.600 --> 00:05:27.850
SOUGWEN CHUNG: Yeah, there is.

00:05:27.850 --> 00:05:29.930
Well, the third
generation is actually

00:05:29.930 --> 00:05:32.900
the multi-robotic system
which is the painting ones.

00:05:32.900 --> 00:05:37.280
But there's a fourth generation
that I can't talk about yet.

00:05:37.280 --> 00:05:38.355
But it'll be coming soon.

00:05:38.355 --> 00:05:40.480
TIMOTHY JORDAN: Awesome,
well I look forward to it.

00:05:40.480 --> 00:05:43.300
SOUGWEN CHUNG: Yeah,
I'm excited to share it.

00:05:43.300 --> 00:05:46.370
TIMOTHY JORDAN: The score
for the work by Aquarian.

00:05:46.370 --> 00:05:49.190
How did that contribute
to the raw work.

00:05:49.190 --> 00:05:51.560
SOUGWEN CHUNG: It
contributed so much.

00:05:51.560 --> 00:05:56.960
Aquarian has been a good friend
of mine for quite a while.

00:05:56.960 --> 00:06:01.620
And does some incredible
music that is actually quite--

00:06:01.620 --> 00:06:04.080
it's brilliant.

00:06:04.080 --> 00:06:08.510
I think I was describing it
earlier as it's futuristic

00:06:08.510 --> 00:06:13.400
but also taps into this
nostalgia about jungle and drum

00:06:13.400 --> 00:06:16.010
and bass that's really,
really interesting.

00:06:16.010 --> 00:06:21.710
I sort of asked him to come
up with the score for me.

00:06:21.710 --> 00:06:23.750
And discussed with him
about the themes I'd

00:06:23.750 --> 00:06:25.320
like him to interpret.

00:06:25.320 --> 00:06:29.960
So he really came up with
a beautiful, melodic work

00:06:29.960 --> 00:06:32.570
that really adds so
much to the piece.

00:06:32.570 --> 00:06:35.780
We were really excited
to collaborate with

00:06:35.780 --> 00:06:38.910
and use the 40 sound
system from Monome

00:06:38.910 --> 00:06:41.360
and spatialize this work.

00:06:41.360 --> 00:06:44.160
One component of the
performance that we did--

00:06:44.160 --> 00:06:49.160
especially for I/O-- was the
integration of a contact mic

00:06:49.160 --> 00:06:49.860
component.

00:06:49.860 --> 00:06:52.550
So in the beginning
my drawing gestures

00:06:52.550 --> 00:06:57.800
actually form architectural
sound throughout the space.

00:06:57.800 --> 00:07:00.800
And it was really cool
to control the universe

00:07:00.800 --> 00:07:02.090
of the performance like that.

00:07:02.090 --> 00:07:05.170
So we were very excited about
it and hope to do again soon.

00:07:05.170 --> 00:07:06.462
TIMOTHY JORDAN: That's awesome.

00:07:06.462 --> 00:07:07.510
OK, one more question--

00:07:07.510 --> 00:07:08.690
and I have to ask this.

00:07:08.690 --> 00:07:12.170
What's the biggest surprise
your robot partner has ever

00:07:12.170 --> 00:07:13.540
given you in a performance?

00:07:13.540 --> 00:07:16.460
SOUGWEN CHUNG: I like
your verbiage with that.

00:07:16.460 --> 00:07:19.850
Because I do think
about it as giving

00:07:19.850 --> 00:07:21.980
of the artistic behavior.

00:07:21.980 --> 00:07:24.530
I think it's been
incredibly surprising.

00:07:24.530 --> 00:07:28.160
I think one of the reasons I've
been working with neural nets

00:07:28.160 --> 00:07:33.260
is its native
ability to generate

00:07:33.260 --> 00:07:37.850
non-human, unexpected behaviors.

00:07:37.850 --> 00:07:40.760
It's been a really interesting
way of looking at my own work.

00:07:40.760 --> 00:07:45.050
Because I train all my neural
nets on my own drawings

00:07:45.050 --> 00:07:47.690
to re-examine the
type of work I do.

00:07:47.690 --> 00:07:51.030
And see how it feels to
be articulated by a unit.

00:07:51.030 --> 00:07:53.690
So I think it's
constantly surprising me.

00:07:53.690 --> 00:07:55.857
Which is probably not the
answer you're looking for.

00:07:55.857 --> 00:07:58.357
TIMOTHY JORDAN: I don't know,
I think that's a great answer.

00:07:58.357 --> 00:08:00.720
SOUGWEN CHUNG: I
will say what I do

00:08:00.720 --> 00:08:05.500
find surprising about the duets
is not only the robot's output,

00:08:05.500 --> 00:08:09.240
but the response to it has
been really interesting.

00:08:09.240 --> 00:08:13.170
And it's really taken off a
lot of speculative questions

00:08:13.170 --> 00:08:15.810
about technology and philosophy.

00:08:15.810 --> 00:08:20.460
And sort of what it means to
make work as an artist today.

00:08:20.460 --> 00:08:23.640
So that's been the most
surprising connection

00:08:23.640 --> 00:08:26.430
that this performance
has created for me.

00:08:26.430 --> 00:08:28.290
TIMOTHY JORDAN:
Thank you for that.

00:08:28.290 --> 00:08:30.583
And thanks for sharing your
vision and your art with us

00:08:30.583 --> 00:08:31.250
here at I/O '19.

00:08:31.250 --> 00:08:33.150
SOUGWEN CHUNG: Thank you.

00:08:33.150 --> 00:08:35.900
