00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:14.740
 

00:00:14.740 --> 00:00:17.980
The plaintiffs in most
copyright infringement suits

00:00:17.980 --> 00:00:22.650
are interested in money in addition
to, or sometimes instead of,

00:00:22.650 --> 00:00:25.630
the kind of injunctive relief
considered in the previous segment

00:00:25.630 --> 00:00:27.320
of this lecture.

00:00:27.320 --> 00:00:29.160
In the United States,
such plaintiffs are

00:00:29.160 --> 00:00:32.060
able to rely on three
different principles

00:00:32.060 --> 00:00:35.310
when seeking financial recoveries.

00:00:35.310 --> 00:00:39.920
First, they could
obtain "actual damages".

00:00:39.920 --> 00:00:43.390
In other words, enough money to
compensate them for the injuries

00:00:43.390 --> 00:00:45.170
they have sustained.

00:00:45.170 --> 00:00:49.720
Second, they can recover
profits made by the defendants

00:00:49.720 --> 00:00:53.520
attributable to the
defendant's infringing behavior

00:00:53.520 --> 00:00:57.070
so long as those profits are not
duplicative of the actual damages

00:00:57.070 --> 00:00:59.380
sustained by the plaintiffs.

00:00:59.380 --> 00:01:02.440
Last but not least,
instead of either actual

00:01:02.440 --> 00:01:08.360
damages or lost profits, plaintiffs may
recover so-called statutory damages--

00:01:08.360 --> 00:01:11.330
sums of money that bear
no necessary relationship

00:01:11.330 --> 00:01:15.230
to either the magnitude of the
injuries the plaintiff sustained

00:01:15.230 --> 00:01:20.720
or to the profits wrongfully
earned by the defendants.

00:01:20.720 --> 00:01:23.420
The first two of these
forms of recovery,

00:01:23.420 --> 00:01:27.680
actual damages and defendant's
profits, are conventional.

00:01:27.680 --> 00:01:30.560
Although the methods by which
they are calculated in US courts

00:01:30.560 --> 00:01:34.630
are somewhat unusual, these
two types of monetary recovery

00:01:34.630 --> 00:01:37.950
may be found in the copyright systems
of most countries in the world

00:01:37.950 --> 00:01:39.920
and indeed are often
granted to the victims

00:01:39.920 --> 00:01:42.560
of many other kinds
of unlawful behavior,

00:01:42.560 --> 00:01:46.380
both in the United States and elsewhere.

00:01:46.380 --> 00:01:50.450
The third form of recovery,
by contrast, is unusual.

00:01:50.450 --> 00:01:55.750
Relatively few countries currently
recognize so-called statutory damages

00:01:55.750 --> 00:01:58.900
and there's considerable controversy
over whether they should.

00:01:58.900 --> 00:02:01.420
 

00:02:01.420 --> 00:02:03.230
I'll now spend about
20 minutes describing

00:02:03.230 --> 00:02:07.260
how these three types of
financial recovery work.

00:02:07.260 --> 00:02:09.470
When I'm done, I'll
step back from the trees

00:02:09.470 --> 00:02:11.740
and consider the ongoing
debate concerning

00:02:11.740 --> 00:02:16.770
which dimensions of this forest
make sense and which do not.

00:02:16.770 --> 00:02:20.150
 

00:02:20.150 --> 00:02:22.230
The statutory authority
for the first approach

00:02:22.230 --> 00:02:25.740
is contained in section
504(b) of the statute.

00:02:25.740 --> 00:02:28.800
As you can see, that provision
entitles a copyright owner

00:02:28.800 --> 00:02:32.220
to recover "the actual
damages suffered by him

00:02:32.220 --> 00:02:36.320
or her as a result of the infringement."

00:02:36.320 --> 00:02:39.550
The purpose of this provision is
to enable a successful plaintiff

00:02:39.550 --> 00:02:43.510
to recoup all of the money she
lost because of the defendant's

00:02:43.510 --> 00:02:45.410
infringement.

00:02:45.410 --> 00:02:48.650
The most clear cut example
consists of profits

00:02:48.650 --> 00:02:51.730
the plaintiff would have
earned had the defendant not

00:02:51.730 --> 00:02:56.550
encroached upon her
copyright unlawfully.

00:02:56.550 --> 00:03:00.670
The conventional way of proving
such lost profits by the plaintiff

00:03:00.670 --> 00:03:03.850
is to introduce evidence of the
volume of sales at the plaintiff

00:03:03.850 --> 00:03:07.870
likely would have enjoyed in the
absence of the defendant's behavior

00:03:07.870 --> 00:03:11.220
combined with evidence concerning
the profit the plaintiff would likely

00:03:11.220 --> 00:03:16.120
have a earned on each of those sales.

00:03:16.120 --> 00:03:19.110
A less well established
variant of this approach

00:03:19.110 --> 00:03:22.390
permits the plaintiff to
recoup losses she sustained

00:03:22.390 --> 00:03:26.500
if she was forced to reduce the price
of authorized copies of her work

00:03:26.500 --> 00:03:30.480
in order to compete with
the infringing defendant.

00:03:30.480 --> 00:03:32.320
This component of
actual damages certainly

00:03:32.320 --> 00:03:38.360
makes sense as a matter of theory,
but case loss support for it is thin.

00:03:38.360 --> 00:03:42.380
A recent addition to the set
of types of actual damages

00:03:42.380 --> 00:03:45.370
is the so-called value of use theory.

00:03:45.370 --> 00:03:49.150
The idea underlying this
variant is that a plaintiff

00:03:49.150 --> 00:03:51.570
should be able to
recover from a defendant

00:03:51.570 --> 00:03:54.620
an amount of money
equivalent to the license fee

00:03:54.620 --> 00:03:57.830
that the defendant would have
paid to the plaintiff in order

00:03:57.830 --> 00:04:02.640
to obtain permission to engage
in the conduct at issue.

00:04:02.640 --> 00:04:05.760
Somewhat more specifically,
this variant permits a plaintiff

00:04:05.760 --> 00:04:10.400
to recover from the defendant the
amount that a willing licensee would

00:04:10.400 --> 00:04:16.451
have paid a willing licensor for
the right to engage in that conduct.

00:04:16.451 --> 00:04:19.430
In determining that amount,
courts take into account

00:04:19.430 --> 00:04:23.960
such factors as the customs prevailing
in the industry in question,

00:04:23.960 --> 00:04:27.380
the terms on which the plaintiff
herself had previously granted licenses

00:04:27.380 --> 00:04:30.750
to other parties to engage
in similar activities,

00:04:30.750 --> 00:04:34.810
and perhaps special circumstances
that would have prompted the plaintiff

00:04:34.810 --> 00:04:40.310
to demand unusually
high or low licensees.

00:04:40.310 --> 00:04:43.110
As I say, this so-called
value of use theory

00:04:43.110 --> 00:04:45.325
is a relatively recent innovation.

00:04:45.325 --> 00:04:48.480
It was pioneered by the Seventh
Circuit Court of Appeals

00:04:48.480 --> 00:04:52.530
in the Deltak case in 1985.

00:04:52.530 --> 00:04:55.670
The Court of Appeals for the
Second Circuit, which, as you know,

00:04:55.670 --> 00:04:58.710
enjoys disproportionate
influence in copyright law,

00:04:58.710 --> 00:05:01.600
initially rejected this
basis of liability.

00:05:01.600 --> 00:05:05.440
But in 2001, in the case
of Davis versus The Gap,

00:05:05.440 --> 00:05:07.910
the Second Circuit embraced it.

00:05:07.910 --> 00:05:12.050
A year later, the Ninth
Circuit did as well.

00:05:12.050 --> 00:05:16.470
Nevertheless, the argument
remains highly controversial.

00:05:16.470 --> 00:05:20.350
Critics contend that it fails to
take into account the likelihood

00:05:20.350 --> 00:05:25.780
that if the defendant had been aware
of the illegality of his activity,

00:05:25.780 --> 00:05:28.890
he might not have engaged in
it at all and thus would not

00:05:28.890 --> 00:05:32.180
have paid the plaintiff
any license fees.

00:05:32.180 --> 00:05:37.490
In short, the critics argue, this
theory gives the plaintiff a windfall.

00:05:37.490 --> 00:05:41.530
Finally, some courts have been
willing to allow plaintiffs

00:05:41.530 --> 00:05:44.190
to recover under the
heading of actual damages

00:05:44.190 --> 00:05:46.560
sums of money necessary
to compensate them

00:05:46.560 --> 00:05:51.000
for what might be described as
indirect or collateral injuries.

00:05:51.000 --> 00:05:54.280
Included in this grab bag
are such things as money

00:05:54.280 --> 00:05:56.030
the plaintiff was
forced to spend in order

00:05:56.030 --> 00:05:58.820
to modify her own product to
compete with the defendant's

00:05:58.820 --> 00:06:03.010
infringing product,
loss of goodwill because

00:06:03.010 --> 00:06:07.290
of the presence in the market of
the defendant's infringing product

00:06:07.290 --> 00:06:12.050
misled consumers into thinking that
the plaintiff's version was not unique,

00:06:12.050 --> 00:06:16.580
and ancillary revenue that the plaintiff
may have lost because the defendant

00:06:16.580 --> 00:06:19.740
failed to give her appropriate
credit for her creations.

00:06:19.740 --> 00:06:23.120
 

00:06:23.120 --> 00:06:25.030
Either the plaintiff
or the defendant may

00:06:25.030 --> 00:06:31.300
insist that these issues be resolved by
a jury rather than by the trial judge.

00:06:31.300 --> 00:06:34.610
The way in which burdens of
proof are allocated at trial

00:06:34.610 --> 00:06:36.710
is that the plaintiff
bears the initial burden

00:06:36.710 --> 00:06:39.690
of showing a reasonable
probability that there's

00:06:39.690 --> 00:06:41.780
a causal connection
between the defendant's

00:06:41.780 --> 00:06:45.540
infringing activities and
the plaintiff's injuries.

00:06:45.540 --> 00:06:49.700
The defendant then has an opportunity
to rebut those assertions.

00:06:49.700 --> 00:06:53.050
If he fails to do so, the
plaintiff is entitled to recover.

00:06:53.050 --> 00:06:56.280
 

00:06:56.280 --> 00:06:58.660
The statutory basis of
the plaintiff's a right

00:06:58.660 --> 00:07:04.800
to recover the defendant's profits
is also contained in section 504(b).

00:07:04.800 --> 00:07:07.680
As you can see, that provision
indicates that a copyright owner

00:07:07.680 --> 00:07:12.200
is entitled to recover "any
profits of the infringer that

00:07:12.200 --> 00:07:14.440
are attributable to the
infringement and are not

00:07:14.440 --> 00:07:18.640
take into account in
computing actual damages."

00:07:18.640 --> 00:07:21.250
The last clause in this
sentence prevents a plaintiff

00:07:21.250 --> 00:07:25.110
from using this device to
achieve a double recovery.

00:07:25.110 --> 00:07:28.540
In other words, any profit
the defendant reaped

00:07:28.540 --> 00:07:32.070
that derived from sales
diverted from the plaintiff

00:07:32.070 --> 00:07:35.600
must be excluded from the plaintiff's
recovery under this theory,

00:07:35.600 --> 00:07:38.300
because they've already
been taken into account

00:07:38.300 --> 00:07:41.460
under the heading of actual damages.

00:07:41.460 --> 00:07:44.610
As a practical matter,
this exclusion means

00:07:44.610 --> 00:07:47.310
that the opportunity to
recover a defendant's profits

00:07:47.310 --> 00:07:51.120
is most beneficial to
plaintiffs in two situations.

00:07:51.120 --> 00:07:55.490
First, where there are more than two
competitors in the relevant market

00:07:55.490 --> 00:07:57.920
and thus that the
defendant's profits were

00:07:57.920 --> 00:08:03.330
diverted not just from the plaintiff,
but also from a third party.

00:08:03.330 --> 00:08:08.690
Second, where the defendant has a much
larger business than the plaintiff

00:08:08.690 --> 00:08:11.530
and thus was able to sell many
more products than the plaintiff

00:08:11.530 --> 00:08:12.360
could have done.

00:08:12.360 --> 00:08:15.280
 

00:08:15.280 --> 00:08:19.170
Burdens of proof under this
heading are allocated as follows.

00:08:19.170 --> 00:08:23.330
The plaintiff must introduce evidence
of the defendant's gross revenues.

00:08:23.330 --> 00:08:26.110
The statute, as you can see,
does not require the plaintiff

00:08:26.110 --> 00:08:29.730
to show that the revenue at issue
is attributable to the defendant's

00:08:29.730 --> 00:08:31.660
unlawful behavior.

00:08:31.660 --> 00:08:34.669
But the courts have added
that important qualification

00:08:34.669 --> 00:08:38.330
to the plaintiff's burden.

00:08:38.330 --> 00:08:42.590
So what kinds of revenues
count under this standard?

00:08:42.590 --> 00:08:45.320
The principal examples are
those I just mentioned.

00:08:45.320 --> 00:08:51.650
Namely, revenues earned by the defendant
from sales of an infringing product.

00:08:51.650 --> 00:08:56.180
What about revenues he earned from sales
of related non-infringing products that

00:08:56.180 --> 00:08:59.770
were boosted in some way by
sales of the infringing products?

00:08:59.770 --> 00:09:04.100
These are recoverable in
theory, but difficult to prove.

00:09:04.100 --> 00:09:07.240
Occasionally courts have
also been willing to count

00:09:07.240 --> 00:09:11.990
under this heading revenues generated by
advertisements created and distributed

00:09:11.990 --> 00:09:15.230
by the defendants that
contain infringing material.

00:09:15.230 --> 00:09:17.690
Usually, however, such
recoveries are denied

00:09:17.690 --> 00:09:19.740
because the plaintiff
is unable to establish

00:09:19.740 --> 00:09:22.820
a causal connection
between the advertisements

00:09:22.820 --> 00:09:28.000
at issue and the
defendant's enhanced sales.

00:09:28.000 --> 00:09:32.870
Finally, revenue attributable to the
enhancement of a defendant's goodwill

00:09:32.870 --> 00:09:35.670
caused by his sales
of infringing products

00:09:35.670 --> 00:09:42.810
are, again, recoverable in theory,
but almost never provable in practice.

00:09:42.810 --> 00:09:46.500
Of course, the defendant's
gross revenue overstates

00:09:46.500 --> 00:09:49.526
the magnitude of his illicit gain.

00:09:49.526 --> 00:09:55.010
To determine his profit, we must deduct
from his revenues the associated costs.

00:09:55.010 --> 00:09:58.140
For obvious reasons, the burden
to introduce evidence concerning

00:09:58.140 --> 00:10:03.050
the magnitude of those costs is borne
by the defendant, not the plaintiff.

00:10:03.050 --> 00:10:07.290
What kinds of expenditures may
fairly be counted as costs?

00:10:07.290 --> 00:10:09.190
In answering that
question, courts typically

00:10:09.190 --> 00:10:13.200
look to generally accepted
accounting principles.

00:10:13.200 --> 00:10:15.930
An interesting nuance
under this heading is

00:10:15.930 --> 00:10:18.190
that a defendant is
permitted to deduct income

00:10:18.190 --> 00:10:23.900
taxes unless his
infringement was willful.

00:10:23.900 --> 00:10:28.200
Intriguing issues arise when
the defendant's product consists

00:10:28.200 --> 00:10:32.520
of a combination of infringing material
and non-infringing original material

00:10:32.520 --> 00:10:34.970
contributed by the defendant.

00:10:34.970 --> 00:10:37.460
Under such circumstances,
the defendant is

00:10:37.460 --> 00:10:41.820
permitted to introduce evidence showing
what portion of the revenue generated

00:10:41.820 --> 00:10:46.920
by the composite product is properly
attributable to his own non-infringing

00:10:46.920 --> 00:10:53.100
contribution, and thus not
properly payable to the plaintiff.

00:10:53.100 --> 00:10:56.460
Delicate and difficult
questions lurk here concerning

00:10:56.460 --> 00:11:00.500
what features of products
matter to consumers.

00:11:00.500 --> 00:11:04.670
Remember for example, the controversy
between the photographer Art Rogers

00:11:04.670 --> 00:11:09.970
and Jeff Koons arising out of Koons'
use of this photograph as the reference

00:11:09.970 --> 00:11:12.840
work for this sculpture.

00:11:12.840 --> 00:11:15.820
As you'll recall, Koons'
effort to excuse this behavior

00:11:15.820 --> 00:11:18.920
on the basis of the Fair
Use Doctrine failed.

00:11:18.920 --> 00:11:21.940
Rogers was thus entitled to damages.

00:11:21.940 --> 00:11:25.310
Included in the sum to
which Rogers was entitled

00:11:25.310 --> 00:11:29.840
was the profit that Koons earned
as a result of his infringement.

00:11:29.840 --> 00:11:34.340
Koons made a lot of money by
selling copies of his sculpture.

00:11:34.340 --> 00:11:38.080
Specifically, three of
the four copies he made

00:11:38.080 --> 00:11:44.112
were sold to collectors for
a total sum of $367,000.

00:11:44.112 --> 00:11:48.140
A substantial portion of
that sum represented profit.

00:11:48.140 --> 00:11:51.480
Koons argued, plausibly,
that much of the profit

00:11:51.480 --> 00:11:53.940
was attributable to his
own creative contributions,

00:11:53.940 --> 00:11:57.380
not to the value he
derived from Rogers photos.

00:11:57.380 --> 00:12:01.420
He also argued that some of that
profit derived from a third source,

00:12:01.420 --> 00:12:06.580
specifically from Koons'
artistic reputation.

00:12:06.580 --> 00:12:09.480
Koons is something of a
star in the art world.

00:12:09.480 --> 00:12:12.860
The large amounts that
collectors pay for his works

00:12:12.860 --> 00:12:16.060
are attributable, in
large part, to the fact

00:12:16.060 --> 00:12:20.340
that Koons made them,
not to their final form.

00:12:20.340 --> 00:12:23.820
In this particular case, Koons
contended that Rogers did not

00:12:23.820 --> 00:12:29.180
deserve to share in that
reputational premium.

00:12:29.180 --> 00:12:32.820
The Court of Appeals for
the Second Circuit agreed.

00:12:32.820 --> 00:12:35.650
Here's the pertinent language.

00:12:35.650 --> 00:12:38.780
"On the subject of apportioning
profits, the copyright law

00:12:38.780 --> 00:12:43.260
requires that Koons have the opportunity
to establish those elements of profit

00:12:43.260 --> 00:12:46.790
attributable to factors other
than the copyrighted work.

00:12:46.790 --> 00:12:52.330
These elements may include Koons'
own notoriety and his related ability

00:12:52.330 --> 00:12:55.270
to command high prices for his work.

00:12:55.270 --> 00:12:58.440
To the extent that Koons is able
to prove that the profits at issue

00:12:58.440 --> 00:13:01.950
derive solely from his own
position in the art world,

00:13:01.950 --> 00:13:07.070
he should be allowed to retain them."

00:13:07.070 --> 00:13:11.990
We come finally to the controversial
topic of statutory damages.

00:13:11.990 --> 00:13:13.880
Here's how they work.

00:13:13.880 --> 00:13:18.250
Section 504(c) provides that at
any point before final judgment

00:13:18.250 --> 00:13:21.460
in a copyright case, the
plaintiff may renounce

00:13:21.460 --> 00:13:25.340
the recovery of actual damages
and defendant's profits

00:13:25.340 --> 00:13:31.550
and instead opt to recover an amount
of money set by a jury or the judge.

00:13:31.550 --> 00:13:33.010
How much money?

00:13:33.010 --> 00:13:37.910
The pertinent statutory provision
sets forth some broad ranges,

00:13:37.910 --> 00:13:40.160
but gives the decision
maker lots of discretion

00:13:40.160 --> 00:13:44.230
in picking a point within those ranges.

00:13:44.230 --> 00:13:48.260
The currently applicable
ranges appear on your screen.

00:13:48.260 --> 00:13:51.740
The default, as you can
see, is between $750

00:13:51.740 --> 00:13:58.410
per infringed copyrighted work
and $30,000 per infringed work.

00:13:58.410 --> 00:14:01.040
If the defendant's conduct
was willful, meaning

00:14:01.040 --> 00:14:05.510
that the defendant knew that his
conduct violated the copyright statute,

00:14:05.510 --> 00:14:10.790
then the range is between
$750 and $150,000.

00:14:10.790 --> 00:14:14.500
A lower range, as you can see,
applies if the defendant's behavior

00:14:14.500 --> 00:14:19.390
was innocent, meaning that
"the infringer was not aware

00:14:19.390 --> 00:14:23.730
and had no reason to believe
that his or her acts constituted

00:14:23.730 --> 00:14:27.150
an infringement of copyright."

00:14:27.150 --> 00:14:30.450
In other words, innocence in
this sense has both a subjective

00:14:30.450 --> 00:14:32.910
and an objective component.

00:14:32.910 --> 00:14:35.550
To qualify for the lower
range, it's not enough

00:14:35.550 --> 00:14:40.310
that a defendant was unaware of
the illegality of his actions.

00:14:40.310 --> 00:14:43.805
It's also necessary that his
misimpression had been reasonable.

00:14:43.805 --> 00:14:46.410
 

00:14:46.410 --> 00:14:51.050
Who picks the amount of statutory
damages within these broad ranges?

00:14:51.050 --> 00:14:53.460
Congress, as you can see
from the text of the statute,

00:14:53.460 --> 00:14:58.740
clearly contemplated that "the
court," meaning the trial judge,

00:14:58.740 --> 00:15:01.520
would make that determination.

00:15:01.520 --> 00:15:04.710
But the United States Supreme
Court in the Feltner case

00:15:04.710 --> 00:15:08.470
determined that the Seventh
Amendment provides a right to a jury

00:15:08.470 --> 00:15:12.350
trial in all issues pertinent
to an award of statutory damages

00:15:12.350 --> 00:15:20.340
under Section 504(a), including
the amount of the award itself.

00:15:20.340 --> 00:15:25.230
The upshot is that every time
you see the word court in 504(c),

00:15:25.230 --> 00:15:30.290
you should replace it
with the word jury.

00:15:30.290 --> 00:15:35.910
What factors should the decision maker
rely upon when setting that amount?

00:15:35.910 --> 00:15:38.380
The only guideline the
statute itself provides

00:15:38.380 --> 00:15:43.330
is that it should be the amount
that the court considers just.

00:15:43.330 --> 00:15:47.850
When, after Feltner, courts delegate
this determination to juries,

00:15:47.850 --> 00:15:53.990
they usually instruct the juries to pick
the amount the juries consider just.

00:15:53.990 --> 00:15:56.970
Sometimes the judges
suggest other factors

00:15:56.970 --> 00:16:02.260
that the jury could consider when
making their choice, such as evidence

00:16:02.260 --> 00:16:06.610
of how much the plaintiff was actually
harmed, the need to deter wrongdoing

00:16:06.610 --> 00:16:11.560
in the future, the nature of the
plaintiff's work, and so forth.

00:16:11.560 --> 00:16:13.110
But these are just suggestions.

00:16:13.110 --> 00:16:17.365
Within the ranges set by the statute,
the jury is largely in constraint.

00:16:17.365 --> 00:16:20.330
 

00:16:20.330 --> 00:16:23.920
If the defendant has infringed only one
of the plaintiff's copyrighted works,

00:16:23.920 --> 00:16:27.920
say a novel or a musical
composition, then as we've seen,

00:16:27.920 --> 00:16:34.010
the maximum amount of statutory damages
the plaintiff can recover is $150,000.

00:16:34.010 --> 00:16:37.060
But if the plaintiff has infringed
two of the plaintiff's works,

00:16:37.060 --> 00:16:38.560
the amount doubles.

00:16:38.560 --> 00:16:42.010
If three, it triples, and so forth.

00:16:42.010 --> 00:16:44.680
The key variable, to
repeat, is not the number

00:16:44.680 --> 00:16:48.460
of occasions on which the defendant
has engaged in an infringement.

00:16:48.460 --> 00:16:53.180
It's the number of
works he has infringed.

00:16:53.180 --> 00:16:57.040
In some cases, that
number is not obvious.

00:16:57.040 --> 00:17:02.220
For example, if I rip a CD
containing 12 sound recordings,

00:17:02.220 --> 00:17:05.900
have I infringed one work or 12?

00:17:05.900 --> 00:17:09.160
For obvious reasons, it
makes a big difference.

00:17:09.160 --> 00:17:11.950
The general standard the courts
use in such circumstances

00:17:11.950 --> 00:17:16.880
is that the individual pieces
are deemed distinct works if

00:17:16.880 --> 00:17:21.109
and only if they have
independent economic value.

00:17:21.109 --> 00:17:25.369
And applying that criterion, courts
unavoidably exercise some discretion

00:17:25.369 --> 00:17:27.819
and often tacitly
exercise that discretion

00:17:27.819 --> 00:17:29.985
in an effort to do rough justice.

00:17:29.985 --> 00:17:33.040
 

00:17:33.040 --> 00:17:36.530
A crucial limitation on the
availability of statutory damages

00:17:36.530 --> 00:17:39.410
is that with narrow
exceptions, they are only

00:17:39.410 --> 00:17:42.540
available if the plaintiff
registered her work prior

00:17:42.540 --> 00:17:44.800
to the defendant's infringement.

00:17:44.800 --> 00:17:48.480
As you know from lecture number
six, registration of a copyright

00:17:48.480 --> 00:17:51.180
is now optional in the US.

00:17:51.180 --> 00:17:54.760
But registration gives a
copyright owner some advantages.

00:17:54.760 --> 00:17:59.760
The availability of statutory
damages in case of infringement

00:17:59.760 --> 00:18:02.240
is perhaps the most important
of those advantages.

00:18:02.240 --> 00:18:05.640
 

00:18:05.640 --> 00:18:07.990
In addition to damages
of these three sorts,

00:18:07.990 --> 00:18:11.230
parties who prevail in
copyright infringement suits

00:18:11.230 --> 00:18:16.660
can sometimes recover their court
costs and their attorney's fees.

00:18:16.660 --> 00:18:18.760
These amounts are not trivial.

00:18:18.760 --> 00:18:22.460
Attorney's fees in
particular can be very large.

00:18:22.460 --> 00:18:26.000
Indeed, anxiety about possible
liability for attorney's fees

00:18:26.000 --> 00:18:29.140
is often the principal
driver that motivates

00:18:29.140 --> 00:18:33.040
settlements of infringement suits.

00:18:33.040 --> 00:18:35.380
That anxiety derives
in part from the fact

00:18:35.380 --> 00:18:38.530
that both costs and attorney's
fees are more commonly

00:18:38.530 --> 00:18:42.880
awarded in copyright cases than in
most other types of suit in the United

00:18:42.880 --> 00:18:44.460
States.

00:18:44.460 --> 00:18:47.740
With respect to both costs
and fees, the trial court

00:18:47.740 --> 00:18:52.830
is empowered to make
awards "in its discretion."

00:18:52.830 --> 00:18:57.090
The kinds of factors the courts look
to when exercising that discretion

00:18:57.090 --> 00:19:02.170
include the strength of the losing
party's substantive arguments--

00:19:02.170 --> 00:19:07.230
the stronger they were, the less likely
will be the court to award fees--

00:19:07.230 --> 00:19:10.420
the legitimacy of the reasons
why the losing party litigated

00:19:10.420 --> 00:19:15.160
the case, the need to deter
abusive litigation by similarly

00:19:15.160 --> 00:19:18.880
situated parties in
the future, conversely

00:19:18.880 --> 00:19:21.980
the importance of not deterring
legitimate efforts to defend

00:19:21.980 --> 00:19:29.800
legal rights or to resolve unsettled
legal issues, and so forth.

00:19:29.800 --> 00:19:33.560
The same standards are applied when
assessing requests for costs and fees

00:19:33.560 --> 00:19:37.854
made by prevailing defendants as
when assessing such suggestions made

00:19:37.854 --> 00:19:38.895
by victorious plaintiffs.

00:19:38.895 --> 00:19:41.520
 

00:19:41.520 --> 00:19:44.410
An intriguing variation
on these themes suggested

00:19:44.410 --> 00:19:48.030
by Judge Posner in the
Gonzalez case is that a judge

00:19:48.030 --> 00:19:50.580
should be more willing
to award attorney's fees,

00:19:50.580 --> 00:19:53.380
particularly when the
defendant's behavior was willful,

00:19:53.380 --> 00:19:57.620
if the magnitude of the
compensatory or statutory damages

00:19:57.620 --> 00:20:00.910
that the plaintiff
could collect is modest.

00:20:00.910 --> 00:20:05.550
And thus, unless the plaintiff
could recover such fees,

00:20:05.550 --> 00:20:10.270
she might be disinclined
to assert her rights.

00:20:10.270 --> 00:20:12.850
Finally, it should be
emphasized that attorney's fees,

00:20:12.850 --> 00:20:16.510
like statutory damages, are only
available to copyright owners who

00:20:16.510 --> 00:20:19.690
registered their works
prior to the infringement.

00:20:19.690 --> 00:20:22.980
This reinforces the incentive
I mentioned a minute ago

00:20:22.980 --> 00:20:25.110
to register one's works.

00:20:25.110 --> 00:20:28.260
 

00:20:28.260 --> 00:20:31.360
Underlying this rather
intricate combination of rules

00:20:31.360 --> 00:20:35.140
are five general themes or objectives.

00:20:35.140 --> 00:20:37.930
Sometimes these themes
reinforce one another,

00:20:37.930 --> 00:20:40.610
but sometimes they are in tension.

00:20:40.610 --> 00:20:45.230
When considering how, if at all, this
system of remedies should be modified,

00:20:45.230 --> 00:20:48.800
it's helpful to bring these
objectives to the surface.

00:20:48.800 --> 00:20:55.590
When they conflict, it's necessary to
decide which is the more important.

00:20:55.590 --> 00:21:00.720
The first, and least surprising purpose,
is to compensate copyright owners.

00:21:00.720 --> 00:21:04.190
In other words, to
indemnify them against loss.

00:21:04.190 --> 00:21:07.540
A copyright owner who's been injured
by a defendant's infringement

00:21:07.540 --> 00:21:10.175
should be able to recoup from
the defendant all of her losses.

00:21:10.175 --> 00:21:12.790
 

00:21:12.790 --> 00:21:15.530
All four of the general
theories of copyright law

00:21:15.530 --> 00:21:19.240
we have considered in
this lecture series

00:21:19.240 --> 00:21:23.050
provide support for
this first objective.

00:21:23.050 --> 00:21:27.330
Viewed through the lens of either
fairness or personality theory,

00:21:27.330 --> 00:21:30.450
the rights that the law
confers upon copyright owners

00:21:30.450 --> 00:21:33.280
are grounded in moral considerations.

00:21:33.280 --> 00:21:37.620
The moral right to a fair return
for one's hard creative work,

00:21:37.620 --> 00:21:42.800
or the moral right to protection of the
fragile bond between oneself and one's

00:21:42.800 --> 00:21:44.780
creations.

00:21:44.780 --> 00:21:48.540
Fidelity to those moral
considerations requires at a minimum

00:21:48.540 --> 00:21:51.820
that copyright owners not
suffer uncompensated injuries

00:21:51.820 --> 00:21:55.370
when their legal rights are abridged.

00:21:55.370 --> 00:21:59.060
Viewed through the lens of either
welfare or cultural theory,

00:21:59.060 --> 00:22:02.230
the rights that the law
accords authors and artists

00:22:02.230 --> 00:22:05.420
are designed to induce them to behave
in ways that will advance some larger

00:22:05.420 --> 00:22:11.180
goal, generating and disseminating works
that will advance net social welfare,

00:22:11.180 --> 00:22:15.610
or will foster a rich
and stimulating culture.

00:22:15.610 --> 00:22:18.510
Authors and artists
will not be so induced

00:22:18.510 --> 00:22:23.310
if they are exposed to uncompensated
abridgments of their rights.

00:22:23.310 --> 00:22:27.070
So as to this first point,
there's not much controversy.

00:22:27.070 --> 00:22:29.960
 

00:22:29.960 --> 00:22:34.480
The second of the objectives is the
prevention of unjust enrichment.

00:22:34.480 --> 00:22:38.020
We don't want infringers to
profit from their wrongdoing

00:22:38.020 --> 00:22:42.060
even if copyright owners
do not suffer thereby.

00:22:42.060 --> 00:22:43.580
This is a very common sentiment.

00:22:43.580 --> 00:22:47.280
Not just in copyright law,
but in other fields as well.

00:22:47.280 --> 00:22:50.790
It looms large in
contract law, for example.

00:22:50.790 --> 00:22:54.290
But despite its ubiquity,
it's harder to justify

00:22:54.290 --> 00:22:57.700
and harder to connect convincingly
to the general theories

00:22:57.700 --> 00:23:01.690
upon which copyright law rests.

00:23:01.690 --> 00:23:04.530
It seems connected to
the same intuition that

00:23:04.530 --> 00:23:09.270
prompts us to recoil or object when
a murderer writes a book recounting

00:23:09.270 --> 00:23:14.970
his crime and collects
royalties from it.

00:23:14.970 --> 00:23:19.300
The third goal helps reinforce
the somewhat shaky foundations

00:23:19.300 --> 00:23:22.970
of the second-- deterrence.

00:23:22.970 --> 00:23:26.550
We want to craft remedies that
discourage potential infringers

00:23:26.550 --> 00:23:31.600
from violating copyright owners'
entitlements in the future.

00:23:31.600 --> 00:23:35.340
Litigation is enormously
time consuming and painful.

00:23:35.340 --> 00:23:40.160
A copyright owner forced to litigate
can never be truly made whole.

00:23:40.160 --> 00:23:43.490
Thus, if possible, we
want to deter people

00:23:43.490 --> 00:23:46.550
from infringing their rights
in the first instance.

00:23:46.550 --> 00:23:51.530
One way to do so is to award and
publicize monetary judgments that

00:23:51.530 --> 00:23:55.000
will make potential defendants
think twice or thrice.

00:23:55.000 --> 00:23:57.810
 

00:23:57.810 --> 00:24:01.490
The fourth ambition is punishment.

00:24:01.490 --> 00:24:04.570
Copyright infringement is wrong.

00:24:04.570 --> 00:24:07.540
We want to penalize the
people who engage in it.

00:24:07.540 --> 00:24:11.215
Not just to deter similar
conduct in the future,

00:24:11.215 --> 00:24:14.790
but because the infringers deserve it.

00:24:14.790 --> 00:24:19.060
Another word for this is retribution.

00:24:19.060 --> 00:24:21.440
Finally, copyright law,
as you know by now,

00:24:21.440 --> 00:24:24.190
aspires to create and
maintain a delicate balance

00:24:24.190 --> 00:24:28.530
between on one hand, the entitlements
of creators, and on the other hand,

00:24:28.530 --> 00:24:33.590
the interests of the public in
making use of their creations.

00:24:33.590 --> 00:24:36.950
The primary expression of
the latter is the long list

00:24:36.950 --> 00:24:40.712
of statutory and judicial
exceptions and limitations.

00:24:40.712 --> 00:24:43.170
Embedded in the copyright
statute, the most famous of which

00:24:43.170 --> 00:24:47.190
the United States is
the Fair Use Doctrine.

00:24:47.190 --> 00:24:50.610
Against this back drop,
we want to craft a set

00:24:50.610 --> 00:24:54.270
of remedies that will
maintain that balance.

00:24:54.270 --> 00:24:57.110
In particular, just as we want to
ensure that copyright owners have

00:24:57.110 --> 00:24:59.870
appropriate incentives
to assert their rights,

00:24:59.870 --> 00:25:03.540
so we want to ensure that users
have appropriate incentives

00:25:03.540 --> 00:25:06.910
to assert their privileges.

00:25:06.910 --> 00:25:09.440
In this respect,
copyright infringement is

00:25:09.440 --> 00:25:14.250
fundamentally different
from homicide say, or rape.

00:25:14.250 --> 00:25:16.830
In those contexts, we're
not particularly concerned

00:25:16.830 --> 00:25:19.350
about over enforcement.

00:25:19.350 --> 00:25:21.730
If someone is not entirely
sure what constitutes

00:25:21.730 --> 00:25:25.680
manslaughter or sexual
assault and his behavior is,

00:25:25.680 --> 00:25:31.550
to use the legal vernacular,
"chilled" a bit, we're not troubled.

00:25:31.550 --> 00:25:36.400
That such people are prompted to
steer well clear of a vague line

00:25:36.400 --> 00:25:38.830
is not a serious problem.

00:25:38.830 --> 00:25:43.560
And copyright law, by contrast, chilling
borderline behavior-- in other words,

00:25:43.560 --> 00:25:47.400
discouraging people from engaging in
activities that approach but do not

00:25:47.400 --> 00:25:52.230
cross the line of legality--
is a serious problem.

00:25:52.230 --> 00:25:56.820
When setting and interpreting the
rules governing damage awards,

00:25:56.820 --> 00:25:59.470
we want to avoid it.

00:25:59.470 --> 00:26:04.640
By now, the reason why these goals
sometimes conflict should be clear.

00:26:04.640 --> 00:26:08.090
Goal number three, and even
more so goal number four,

00:26:08.090 --> 00:26:13.330
sometimes counsel larger awards than
is optimal from the standpoint of goal

00:26:13.330 --> 00:26:13.940
number five.

00:26:13.940 --> 00:26:16.500
 

00:26:16.500 --> 00:26:18.910
The context in which these
considerations are currently

00:26:18.910 --> 00:26:22.500
most salient is statutory damages.

00:26:22.500 --> 00:26:24.840
Most countries in the
world do not currently

00:26:24.840 --> 00:26:28.750
permit copyright owners to
recover statutory damages.

00:26:28.750 --> 00:26:31.790
A thorough analysis of the law
of each nation in this regard

00:26:31.790 --> 00:26:36.200
can be found in a forthcoming article by
Pam Samuelson, Tara Wheatland, and Phil

00:26:36.200 --> 00:26:38.220
Hill.

00:26:38.220 --> 00:26:42.370
Phil, as I think you know, is one of
the teaching fellows in the edX course

00:26:42.370 --> 00:26:46.620
for which these lectures
were in part prepared.

00:26:46.620 --> 00:26:49.690
The authors of that study
demonstrate that only 24

00:26:49.690 --> 00:26:54.710
of the 177 member states in the World
Intellectual Property Organization

00:26:54.710 --> 00:26:58.430
currently allow recovery
of statutory damages.

00:26:58.430 --> 00:27:02.300
And very few of the countries
that do have such regimes also

00:27:02.300 --> 00:27:06.100
have copyright based industries
comparable in size and health

00:27:06.100 --> 00:27:09.450
to those in the United States.

00:27:09.450 --> 00:27:13.280
The US is currently trying to
change the state of affairs.

00:27:13.280 --> 00:27:17.430
Its diplomatic representatives
are using various levers

00:27:17.430 --> 00:27:19.990
to try to induce other
nations to adopt systems

00:27:19.990 --> 00:27:24.800
that resemble the system
in force in the US.

00:27:24.800 --> 00:27:25.750
Why?

00:27:25.750 --> 00:27:31.310
Primarily because US based organizations
representing at least some copyright

00:27:31.310 --> 00:27:35.360
owners have asked them to do so.

00:27:35.360 --> 00:27:39.000
Critics of this initiative
make three arguments.

00:27:39.000 --> 00:27:42.470
First, many countries,
unlike the United States,

00:27:42.470 --> 00:27:47.480
regard punishment of offenders as an
inappropriate function of civil damage

00:27:47.480 --> 00:27:49.020
awards.

00:27:49.020 --> 00:27:53.060
Punishment, they believe, should be
left to the criminal law, to which we'll

00:27:53.060 --> 00:27:56.630
return in the last
segment of this lecture.

00:27:56.630 --> 00:27:58.930
The reason why this is
relevant is that over time,

00:27:58.930 --> 00:28:01.470
the US system of statutory
damages has gradually

00:28:01.470 --> 00:28:04.880
taken on an ever more punitive role.

00:28:04.880 --> 00:28:07.590
Originally adopted
primarily as a mechanism

00:28:07.590 --> 00:28:10.560
to provide compensation
for copyright owners who

00:28:10.560 --> 00:28:14.610
have trouble proving the magnitude
of the injuries they suffer,

00:28:14.610 --> 00:28:19.100
it now works in large part
to penalize infringers.

00:28:19.100 --> 00:28:22.510
Many observers,
especially outside the US,

00:28:22.510 --> 00:28:27.880
think that that's not a
role for private lawsuits.

00:28:27.880 --> 00:28:31.270
Second, the critics point
out that the broad ranges

00:28:31.270 --> 00:28:35.090
of permissible awards
under the US system

00:28:35.090 --> 00:28:38.580
and the paucity of meaningful
guidance concerning how awards should

00:28:38.580 --> 00:28:43.590
be set within those ranges give
judges and now juries too much

00:28:43.590 --> 00:28:50.930
discretion and result, consequently, in
unpredictable, even arbitrary awards.

00:28:50.930 --> 00:28:55.650
Uncertainty of this sort is especially
threatening to the delicate balance

00:28:55.650 --> 00:28:59.930
between private rights
and the public interest.

00:28:59.930 --> 00:29:02.420
Third, and finally,
some critics point out

00:29:02.420 --> 00:29:06.550
that the statutory damage system
generates perverse results

00:29:06.550 --> 00:29:10.190
when applied in situations in
which a defendant infringes

00:29:10.190 --> 00:29:15.610
a large number of works, each of
which has only modest economic value.

00:29:15.610 --> 00:29:17.960
Because as we've seen,
copyright owners are

00:29:17.960 --> 00:29:22.980
permitted to recover statutory
damages for each work,

00:29:22.980 --> 00:29:25.440
the result is to enable
them to recover amounts

00:29:25.440 --> 00:29:31.280
that dwarf the injuries that the
copyright owners actually suffer.

00:29:31.280 --> 00:29:37.430
The context in which this unanticipated
problem has proven especially serious

00:29:37.430 --> 00:29:39.830
has been file sharing.

00:29:39.830 --> 00:29:42.860
The large majority of
the individual defendants

00:29:42.860 --> 00:29:45.890
who've been sued by the record
companies for unlawfully copying

00:29:45.890 --> 00:29:50.450
and redistributing sound recordings
through file sharing networks

00:29:50.450 --> 00:29:54.450
have settled the claims for
modest amounts of money.

00:29:54.450 --> 00:30:01.030
But the few defendants who have not
settled have incurred enormous awards.

00:30:01.030 --> 00:30:04.120
Jammie Thomas Rasset,
for example, was found

00:30:04.120 --> 00:30:07.150
to have infringed the
copyrights in 12 recordings,

00:30:07.150 --> 00:30:12.260
and after a series of three
trials, ended up, as you can see,

00:30:12.260 --> 00:30:16.390
with a damage award of $222,000.

00:30:16.390 --> 00:30:18.730
Joel Tenenbaum was
found to have willfully

00:30:18.730 --> 00:30:22.200
violated the copyrights in
30 recordings and ended up

00:30:22.200 --> 00:30:26.690
with a damage award of $675,000.

00:30:26.690 --> 00:30:30.240
In both of those cases,
the trial judges balked

00:30:30.240 --> 00:30:33.240
at the magnitude of the jury's awards.

00:30:33.240 --> 00:30:37.550
In both instances, the judges
concluded that the awards

00:30:37.550 --> 00:30:41.880
were so large as to violate
the federal constitution.

00:30:41.880 --> 00:30:46.380
In both instances, however,
the Court of Appeals reversed.

00:30:46.380 --> 00:30:50.940
Although the grounds on which the two
courts of appeals did so differed.

00:30:50.940 --> 00:30:53.320
In the Thomas Rasset
case, the Eighth Circuit

00:30:53.320 --> 00:30:58.750
rejected the defendant's constitutional
argument on the following ground.

00:30:58.750 --> 00:31:01.300
"Applying the Williams
standard, we conclude

00:31:01.300 --> 00:31:06.600
that an award of $9,250
per each of the 24 works

00:31:06.600 --> 00:31:10.790
is not so severe and oppressive as to be
wholly disproportionate to the offense

00:31:10.790 --> 00:31:13.570
and obviously unreasonable."

00:31:13.570 --> 00:31:16.780
Congress, exercising its
wide latitude of discretion,

00:31:16.780 --> 00:31:21.040
set a statutory damages range for
willful copyright infringement

00:31:21.040 --> 00:31:26.190
of $750 to $150,000 per infringed work.

00:31:26.190 --> 00:31:29.700
The award here is toward the
lower end of this broad range.

00:31:29.700 --> 00:31:33.770
As in Williams, the interests of the
public, the numberless opportunities

00:31:33.770 --> 00:31:38.060
for committing the offense, and the
need for securing uniform adherence

00:31:38.060 --> 00:31:43.750
to federal law support the
constitutionality of the award.

00:31:43.750 --> 00:31:47.270
In the Tenenbaum case, the
First Circuit concluded

00:31:47.270 --> 00:31:50.440
that the trial judge should have
avoided the constitutional question.

00:31:50.440 --> 00:31:52.900
However, in so ruling,
the First Circuit strongly

00:31:52.900 --> 00:31:56.080
intimated that like
the Eighth Circuit, it

00:31:56.080 --> 00:31:58.640
believed the Constitution
had not been violated.

00:31:58.640 --> 00:32:01.280
 

00:32:01.280 --> 00:32:03.670
In both of these cases, the
United States Supreme Court

00:32:03.670 --> 00:32:07.680
declined to review the
Court of Appeals decision.

00:32:07.680 --> 00:32:11.750
As a result, we do not yet have
a conclusive answer concerning

00:32:11.750 --> 00:32:16.360
the constitutionality of such
applications of the statutory damage

00:32:16.360 --> 00:32:18.020
regime.

00:32:18.020 --> 00:32:24.350
And we're not likely to get a conclusive
declaration in the near future.

00:32:24.350 --> 00:32:28.110
The net result is that the
struggle over statutory damages

00:32:28.110 --> 00:32:31.600
will continue in the political arena.

00:32:31.600 --> 00:32:35.570
Reformers in the United
States will seek to curb them.

00:32:35.570 --> 00:32:39.850
Skeptics in other countries will
likely continue to resist them,

00:32:39.850 --> 00:32:45.020
or more modestly, to discipline
statutory damages with guidelines

00:32:45.020 --> 00:32:50.310
more precise than the vague
standards used in the US.

00:32:50.310 --> 00:32:52.830
By contrast,
representatives of copyright

00:32:52.830 --> 00:32:55.090
based industries in
the United States will

00:32:55.090 --> 00:33:01.570
continue to defend statutory damages and
argue for the adoption of the US model

00:33:01.570 --> 00:33:03.520
elsewhere.

00:33:03.520 --> 00:33:07.900
How this struggle will
end remains to be seen.

00:33:07.900 --> 00:33:08.523
