00:00:00.160 --> 00:00:00.860
We’re rolling?

00:00:00.860 --> 00:00:01.360
Mhmm.

00:00:01.360 --> 00:00:01.880
Okay.

00:00:01.880 --> 00:00:02.920
Hi, I’m Corey D’Augustine.

00:00:02.920 --> 00:00:07.840
I want to thank you for following along on
our MoMA IN THE STUDIO videos on YouTube or

00:00:07.840 --> 00:00:12.860
by taking our free course on Coursera called
“In the Studio: Postwar Abstract Painting.”

00:00:12.860 --> 00:00:14.641
Thanks, also, for all of your interesting
questions and comments.

00:00:14.641 --> 00:00:18.869
In fact, we’ve gotten so many great ones
that we decided to do a live Q&amp;A.

00:00:18.869 --> 00:00:24.300
So you might want to drop by here on Wednesday,
that’s May 17th, at 3:30 when I’ll be

00:00:24.300 --> 00:00:26.970
responding to some of the more interesting
ones that we’ve had so far.

00:00:26.970 --> 00:00:30.099
But by all means, it’s not too late, so
please keep them coming.

00:00:30.099 --> 00:00:34.699
So the way that they’re asking questions
is to log on and then to be typing before

00:00:34.699 --> 00:00:36.600
or during the actual session?

00:00:36.600 --> 00:00:39.620
Leave your questions in the comments section.

00:00:39.620 --> 00:00:42.199
Yeah, in the comments below.

00:00:42.200 --> 00:00:43.040
Okay.

00:00:43.040 --> 00:00:47.640
Some of you have already asked some really
thought provoking questions on those videos.

00:00:47.660 --> 00:00:50.180
Also feel free to do that below in the comments
section.

00:00:50.180 --> 00:00:54.710
Some of you have been asking for new videos
about other artists.

00:00:54.710 --> 00:00:57.519
Hope you might be interested to know that
we’re already working on the second section

00:00:57.519 --> 00:00:58.969
of the de Kooning video.

00:00:58.969 --> 00:01:03.549
But if there’s a specific artist or technique
or material or something like that that you

00:01:03.549 --> 00:01:07.000
find really interesting, fascinating, and
you want to know more about, now’s the time

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:08.220
to let us know.

00:01:08.220 --> 00:01:12.070
So for more details, check out the description
below, click the subscribe button, and I’ll

00:01:12.070 --> 00:01:14.180
look forward to seeing you on Wednesday.

00:01:14.180 --> 00:01:17.899
On this video there’s going to be a link
to that even before it’s live?

00:01:17.899 --> 00:01:18.899
Yep.

00:01:18.899 --> 00:01:19.399
Okay.
