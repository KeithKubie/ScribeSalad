00:00:00.012 --> 00:00:03.879
I'll begin by distributing these coefficients to what's inside the parentheses

00:00:03.891 --> 00:00:07.590
on either side of the equation. Now that I've done that, we have very pretty

00:00:07.602 --> 00:00:11.357
integer coefficients. And we don't have to worry about fractions at all. Now

00:00:11.369 --> 00:00:15.015
I'll get all the variables on the left side of the equation, and then I'll move

00:00:15.027 --> 00:00:18.670
all the constants over to the right. Last, I just divide by 4, or of course,

00:00:18.760 --> 00:00:23.254
equivalently, multiply by 1/4. And we get a final answer of x equals negative 22

00:00:23.528 --> 00:00:28.996
over 4. But wait, this is not a fraction in simplest form. Both 22 and 4 are

00:00:29.008 --> 00:00:33.500
divisible by 2, so I can cancel those 2's out, and I end up with negative 11

00:00:33.774 --> 00:00:38.982
over 2. So that, in fact, is the correct answer, x equals negative 11 over 2. I

00:00:39.078 --> 00:00:43.542
can look back at the top and plug this in to check. And in the end, I get

00:00:43.554 --> 00:00:47.489
negative 21 equals negative 21, so we are good to go with this answer. Awesome

00:00:47.489 --> 00:00:47.809
job.

00:00:47.813 --> 00:00:52.933
Just as a side note, you also could have written several other equivalent things

00:00:52.945 --> 00:00:57.455
for our answer, -11 over 2. You could have had negative 5 1/2, or you could also

00:00:57.467 --> 00:00:59.868
have written negative 5.5. Any of those three are correct.
