00:00:00.270 --> 00:00:02.530
So somebody that that's applying for

00:00:02.530 --> 00:00:05.930
a job in a startup hopefully
knows what they're going into.

00:00:05.930 --> 00:00:10.130
It's a very different environment
compensation wise clearly, but

00:00:10.130 --> 00:00:15.790
also the scope of work and
what every person gets to work on.

00:00:15.790 --> 00:00:18.700
The good news is startup work and

00:00:18.700 --> 00:00:22.210
big corporate work
are very different things.

00:00:22.210 --> 00:00:24.680
Not good or bad just different.

00:00:24.680 --> 00:00:28.390
And I think employees recognize that.

00:00:28.390 --> 00:00:32.380
Making sure you explain what it takes
to be an employer in your startup,

00:00:32.380 --> 00:00:34.920
how it's different than
Company X perhaps that

00:00:34.920 --> 00:00:39.490
that person worked with before and
just as important,

00:00:39.490 --> 00:00:44.480
acknowledging the risks Identified in
corporate perhaps there's less risk.

00:00:44.480 --> 00:00:47.700
In start up life
significantly more risk, but

00:00:47.700 --> 00:00:50.400
also greater rewards if
the start up does well.

00:00:50.400 --> 00:00:54.750
So making sure the employee understand
that risk reward balance and

00:00:54.750 --> 00:00:59.030
how that shifts between corporate
to start up is really critical.
