before so the question that concerns a
 

00:04:02.689 --> 00:04:05.679
before so the question that concerns a
lot of people and me is whether the

00:04:05.679 --> 00:04:05.689
lot of people and me is whether the
 

00:04:05.689 --> 00:04:11.140
lot of people and me is whether the
impact that seven billion people or more

00:04:11.140 --> 00:04:11.150
impact that seven billion people or more
 

00:04:11.150 --> 00:04:13.170
impact that seven billion people or more
in the future will have on the earth

00:04:13.170 --> 00:04:13.180
in the future will have on the earth
 

00:04:13.180 --> 00:04:17.890
in the future will have on the earth
will endanger our own well-being and the

the extinction of many species question
 

00:04:26.840 --> 00:04:28.689
the extinction of many species question
is is that going to come back and bite

00:04:28.689 --> 00:04:28.699
is is that going to come back and bite
 

00:04:28.699 --> 00:04:31.930
is is that going to come back and bite
us and if so in what ways demography

provides us with a reliable way to
 

00:04:35.030 --> 00:04:39.100
provides us with a reliable way to
imagine and to reimagine the future so

going to introduce that by telling you

00:09:53.689 --> 00:09:53.699
going to introduce that by telling you
 

00:09:53.699 --> 00:09:58.009
going to introduce that by telling you
about the theory of bathtubs a regular

corresponds to births to the earth and

00:10:08.920 --> 00:10:08.930
corresponds to births to the earth and
 

00:10:08.930 --> 00:10:12.189
corresponds to births to the earth and
water going out corresponds to death and

00:10:12.189 --> 00:10:12.199
water going out corresponds to death and

the level of the bathtub corresponds to
 

00:10:15.180 --> 00:10:20.750
the level of the bathtub corresponds to
the total population size so if the

00:10:20.750 --> 00:10:20.760
the total population size so if the
 

00:10:20.760 --> 00:10:24.079
the total population size so if the
number of births just matches the number

00:10:24.079 --> 00:10:24.089
number of births just matches the number
 

00:10:24.089 --> 00:10:26.810
number of births just matches the number
of deaths the population stays steady

00:10:26.810 --> 00:10:26.820
of deaths the population stays steady
 

00:10:26.820 --> 00:10:28.819
of deaths the population stays steady
and that's the replacement level

00:10:28.819 --> 00:10:28.829
and that's the replacement level
 

00:10:28.829 --> 00:10:31.310
and that's the replacement level

the red line than most of the folks with

the red line than most of the folks with
low fertility are to the left so the

low fertility are to the left so the
 

00:12:36.430 --> 00:12:39.030
low fertility are to the left so the
average is skewed to the right so we

00:12:39.030 --> 00:12:39.040
average is skewed to the right so we
 

00:12:39.040 --> 00:12:42.930

00:14:20.490 --> 00:14:20.500
the challenge of educating those
 

00:14:20.500 --> 00:14:22.740
the challenge of educating those
children is much greater in the

00:14:22.740 --> 00:14:22.750
children is much greater in the
 

00:14:22.750 --> 00:14:24.810
children is much greater in the
developing countries than it is in the

00:14:24.810 --> 00:14:24.820
developing countries than it is in the
 

00:14:24.820 --> 00:14:27.360
developing countries than it is in the
rich countries because those bars keep

00:14:27.360 --> 00:14:27.370
rich countries because those bars keep
 

00:14:27.370 --> 00:14:29.490
rich countries because those bars keep
getting wider as the developing

00:14:29.490 --> 00:14:29.500
getting wider as the developing
 

00:14:29.500 --> 00:14:31.769
getting wider as the developing
countries pump in more children at the

00:14:31.769 --> 00:14:31.779
countries pump in more children at the
 

00:14:31.779 --> 00:14:33.750
countries pump in more children at the
bottom of the pyramid the age groups

00:14:33.750 --> 00:14:33.760
bottom of the pyramid the age groups
 

00:14:33.760 --> 00:14:36.990
bottom of the pyramid the age groups
move up with time as they get older and

00:14:36.990 --> 00:14:37.000
move up with time as they get older and
 

00:14:37.000 --> 00:14:39.900
move up with time as they get older and
so the larger school age population is

00:14:39.900 --> 00:14:39.910
so the larger school age population is
 

00:14:39.910 --> 00:14:42.210
so the larger school age population is
followed ten years later by a much

00:14:42.210 --> 00:14:42.220
followed ten years later by a much
 

00:14:42.220 --> 00:14:45.600
followed ten years later by a much
larger military age population so if you

00:14:45.600 --> 00:14:45.610
larger military age population so if you
 

00:14:45.610 --> 00:14:48.510
larger military age population so if you
look at the age groups 15 to 30 you can

00:14:48.510 --> 00:14:48.520
look at the age groups 15 to 30 you can
 

00:14:48.520 --> 00:14:50.880
look at the age groups 15 to 30 you can
see that the potential military force in

00:14:50.880 --> 00:14:50.890
see that the potential military force in
 

00:14:50.890 --> 00:14:53.069
see that the potential military force in
the developing countries vastly exceeds

00:14:53.069 --> 00:14:53.079
the developing countries vastly exceeds
 

00:14:53.079 --> 00:14:55.019
the developing countries vastly exceeds
that in the rich countries it doesn't

00:14:55.019 --> 00:14:55.029
that in the rich countries it doesn't
 

00:14:55.029 --> 00:14:57.510
that in the rich countries it doesn't
mean it's military power for them it

00:14:57.510 --> 00:14:57.520
mean it's military power for them it
 

00:14:57.520 --> 00:14:59.760
mean it's military power for them it
means they can afford a military

00:14:59.760 --> 00:14:59.770
means they can afford a military
 

00:14:59.770 --> 00:15:02.010
means they can afford a military
engagement in a way that the human

00:15:02.010 --> 00:15:02.020
engagement in a way that the human
 

00:15:02.020 --> 00:15:05.190
engagement in a way that the human
resources of the rich countries make

00:15:05.190 --> 00:15:05.200

you might ask yourself if things are so

00:15:50.930 --> 00:15:50.940
you might ask yourself if things are so
 

00:15:50.940 --> 00:15:52.639
you might ask yourself if things are so
bad there how is it that their

00:15:52.639 --> 00:15:52.649
bad there how is it that their
 

00:15:52.649 --> 00:15:56.840
bad there how is it that their
population is growing so rapidly and the

00:15:56.840 --> 00:15:56.850
population is growing so rapidly and the
 

00:15:56.850 --> 00:15:59.300
population is growing so rapidly and the
fact is that the difference in death

00:15:59.300 --> 00:15:59.310
fact is that the difference in death
 

00:15:59.310 --> 00:16:02.600
fact is that the difference in death
rates is much smaller than the

00:16:02.600 --> 00:16:02.610
rates is much smaller than the
 

00:16:02.610 --> 00:16:05.810
rates is much smaller than the
difference in fertility rates so even

00:16:05.810 --> 00:16:05.820
difference in fertility rates so even
 

00:16:05.820 --> 00:16:08.329
difference in fertility rates so even
though a higher fraction of children die

00:16:08.329 --> 00:16:08.339
though a higher fraction of children die
 

00:16:08.339 --> 00:16:11.120
though a higher fraction of children die
before they reproduce the average number

00:16:11.120 --> 00:16:11.130
before they reproduce the average number
 

00:16:11.130 --> 00:16:13.130
before they reproduce the average number
of children that people have when they

00:16:13.130 --> 00:16:13.140
of children that people have when they
 

00:16:13.140 --> 00:16:16.130
of children that people have when they
do reproduce in the poor countries more

00:16:16.130 --> 00:16:16.140
do reproduce in the poor countries more
 

00:16:16.140 --> 00:16:19.220
do reproduce in the poor countries more
than compensates for the increase in the

than compensates for the increase in the
 

00:16:19.230 --> 00:16:21.560
than compensates for the increase in the
death rate so that's why we have rapid

00:16:21.560 --> 00:16:21.570
death rate so that's why we have rapid
 

00:16:21.570 --> 00:16:23.810

we have high mortality because we have
even higher fertility it's an important

it will grow more slowly it will be
older in the sense that the fraction of
