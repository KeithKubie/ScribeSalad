libraries have been going up at
 

00:09:16.270 --> 00:09:17.520
libraries have been going up at
something like four times the rate of

just unsustainable you can't continue

00:10:38.010 --> 00:10:41.160
 
Harvard's serial expenditures you see

00:10:41.160 --> 00:10:41.170
Harvard's serial expenditures you see
 

00:10:41.170 --> 00:10:44.520

time and you notice we did a pretty good

00:10:50.460 --> 00:10:50.470

budget did hyper inflate until right

00:11:23.680 --> 00:11:23.690
budget did hyper inflate until right
 

00:11:23.690 --> 00:11:25.870
budget did hyper inflate until right
about that time actually a year or two

00:11:25.870 --> 00:11:25.880
about that time actually a year or two
 

00:11:25.880 --> 00:11:29.230

library was growing at a little bit

00:11:32.170 --> 00:11:32.180

Harvard budget overall for many years
 

00:11:41.720 --> 00:11:44.100
Harvard budget overall for many years
and it was because of this

00:11:44.100 --> 00:11:44.110
and it was because of this
 

00:11:44.110 --> 00:11:47.860
and it was because of this
hyperinflation in the costs and a few

00:11:47.860 --> 00:11:47.870
hyperinflation in the costs and a few
 

00:11:47.870 --> 00:11:52.000
hyperinflation in the costs and a few
years ago people realized that that's

00:11:52.000 --> 00:11:52.010
years ago people realized that that's
 

00:11:52.010 --> 00:11:53.830
years ago people realized that that's
just not sustainable if you keep doing

00:11:53.830 --> 00:11:53.840
just not sustainable if you keep doing
 

00:11:53.840 --> 00:11:56.080
just not sustainable if you keep doing
that long enough then all eventually all

00:11:56.080 --> 00:11:56.090
that long enough then all eventually all
 

00:11:56.090 --> 00:11:57.910
that long enough then all eventually all
of the budget of Harvard will be going

00:11:57.910 --> 00:11:57.920
of the budget of Harvard will be going
 

00:11:57.920 --> 00:12:00.130
of the budget of Harvard will be going
to the library and all those other

00:12:00.130 --> 00:12:00.140
to the library and all those other
 

00:12:00.140 --> 00:12:03.160
to the library and all those other
things that Harvard does but not as

00:12:03.160 --> 00:12:03.170
things that Harvard does but not as
 

00:12:03.170 --> 00:12:04.510
things that Harvard does but not as
important as the functions of the

all things like Oh teaching and research

00:12:12.640 --> 00:12:12.650
all things like Oh teaching and research
 

00:12:12.650 --> 00:12:18.130
all things like Oh teaching and research
so so eventually it was understood that

00:12:18.130 --> 00:12:18.140
so so eventually it was understood that
 

00:12:18.140 --> 00:12:20.070
so so eventually it was understood that
this couldn't this couldn't be sustained

00:12:20.070 --> 00:12:20.080
this couldn't this couldn't be sustained
 

00:12:20.080 --> 00:12:23.440
this couldn't this couldn't be sustained
now underlying the underlying cause of

00:12:23.440 --> 00:12:23.450
now underlying the underlying cause of
 

00:12:23.450 --> 00:12:25.360
now underlying the underlying cause of
this hyperinflation it's important to

00:12:25.360 --> 00:12:25.370
this hyperinflation it's important to
 

00:12:25.370 --> 00:12:31.210
this hyperinflation it's important to
realize is a market failure not not

00:12:31.210 --> 00:12:31.220
realize is a market failure not not
 

00:12:31.220 --> 00:12:36.790

increasing real costs and let me say why

00:12:36.790 --> 00:12:36.800
increasing real costs and let me say why
 

00:12:36.800 --> 00:12:42.820
increasing real costs and let me say why
I why I say that how you can see that if

00:12:42.820 --> 00:12:42.830
I why I say that how you can see that if
 

00:12:42.830 --> 00:12:45.940
I why I say that how you can see that if
you look at the cost I mean and I mean

00:12:45.940 --> 00:12:45.950
you look at the cost I mean and I mean

scholarly society and you see that the

00:13:16.690 --> 00:13:16.700
scholarly society and you see that the
 

00:13:16.700 --> 00:13:20.350
scholarly society and you see that the
cost per page is six times higher for

00:13:20.350 --> 00:13:20.360
cost per page is six times higher for
 

00:13:20.360 --> 00:13:22.809
cost per page is six times higher for
commercial journals

00:13:22.809 --> 00:13:22.819
commercial journals
 

00:13:22.819 --> 00:13:25.910
commercial journals
so this is an extraordinary difference

00:13:25.910 --> 00:13:25.920
so this is an extraordinary difference
 

00:13:25.920 --> 00:13:29.240
so this is an extraordinary difference
in the cost of journals between the

00:13:29.240 --> 00:13:29.250
in the cost of journals between the
 

00:13:29.250 --> 00:13:32.269
in the cost of journals between the
commercial publishers and the non-profit

00:13:32.269 --> 00:13:32.279
commercial publishers and the non-profit
 

00:13:32.279 --> 00:13:34.610
commercial publishers and the non-profit
publishers now you might think well

00:13:34.610 --> 00:13:34.620
publishers now you might think well
 

00:13:34.620 --> 00:13:36.050
publishers now you might think well
maybe that's because the commercial

00:13:36.050 --> 00:13:36.060
maybe that's because the commercial
 

00:13:36.060 --> 00:13:41.470
maybe that's because the commercial
journals are higher quality journals and

00:13:41.470 --> 00:13:41.480
journals are higher quality journals and
 

00:13:41.480 --> 00:13:45.350
journals are higher quality journals and
that quality means that they have higher

00:13:45.350 --> 00:13:45.360
that quality means that they have higher
 

00:13:45.360 --> 00:13:46.610
that quality means that they have higher
costs because that would be more

00:13:46.610 --> 00:13:46.620
costs because that would be more
 

00:13:46.620 --> 00:13:48.769
costs because that would be more
selective and they have to add more

00:13:48.769 --> 00:13:48.779
selective and they have to add more
 

00:13:48.779 --> 00:13:51.230
selective and they have to add more
value and so forth and and therefore

00:13:51.230 --> 00:13:51.240
value and so forth and and therefore
 

00:13:51.240 --> 00:13:53.929
value and so forth and and therefore
that's why their cost per page is so

00:13:53.929 --> 00:13:53.939
that's why their cost per page is so
 

00:13:53.939 --> 00:13:56.269
that's why their cost per page is so
much higher well we can look at that too

00:13:56.269 --> 00:13:56.279
much higher well we can look at that too
 

00:13:56.279 --> 00:13:58.879
much higher well we can look at that too
we can take a look at not cost per page

00:13:58.879 --> 00:13:58.889
we can take a look at not cost per page
 

00:13:58.889 --> 00:14:02.449
we can take a look at not cost per page
but a cost per citation using citation

00:14:02.449 --> 00:14:02.459
but a cost per citation using citation
 

00:14:02.459 --> 00:14:04.970
but a cost per citation using citation
as a proxy for quality it's not a great

00:14:04.970 --> 00:14:04.980
as a proxy for quality it's not a great
 

00:14:04.980 --> 00:14:07.699
as a proxy for quality it's not a great
proxy but it's better than nothing a lot

00:14:07.699 --> 00:14:07.709
proxy but it's better than nothing a lot
 

00:14:07.709 --> 00:14:09.860
proxy but it's better than nothing a lot
to correlate someone we can look at the

00:14:09.860 --> 00:14:09.870
to correlate someone we can look at the
 

00:14:09.870 --> 00:14:11.660
to correlate someone we can look at the
cost per citation for these different

cost per citation for these different
 

00:14:11.670 --> 00:14:14.179
cost per citation for these different
journals and here turns out that the

journals and here turns out that the
 

00:14:14.189 --> 00:14:16.100

differential is even larger the cost per
 

00:14:16.110 --> 00:14:18.079
differential is even larger the cost per
citation is 16 times higher for

00:14:18.079 --> 00:14:18.089
citation is 16 times higher for
 

00:14:18.089 --> 00:14:20.300
citation is 16 times higher for
commercial journals and for nonprofit

00:14:20.300 --> 00:14:20.310
commercial journals and for nonprofit
 

00:14:20.310 --> 00:14:26.420
commercial journals and for nonprofit
journals so what this tells you is first

00:14:26.420 --> 00:14:26.430
journals so what this tells you is first
 

00:14:26.430 --> 00:14:28.759

of all it's not that the commercial

of all it's not that the commercial
 

00:14:28.769 --> 00:14:30.050
of all it's not that the commercial
journals are much better and therefore

00:14:30.050 --> 00:14:30.060
journals are much better and therefore
 

00:14:30.060 --> 00:14:34.939
journals are much better and therefore
they're more expensive arguably in terms

00:14:34.939 --> 00:14:34.949
they're more expensive arguably in terms
 

00:14:34.949 --> 00:14:36.980
they're more expensive arguably in terms

that problem in the long run if we're

with that problem subscriptions will

with that problem subscriptions will
continue to hyper inflate and that will

continue to hyper inflate and that will
 

00:15:31.439 --> 00:15:33.110

lead to this continued reduction in

access so either we need to solve this
 

00:15:35.550 --> 00:15:36.240

to these articles well it was issues

to these articles well it was issues
 

00:15:44.800 --> 00:15:48.570
to these articles well it was issues
like this that got people thinking in at

00:15:48.570 --> 00:15:48.580
like this that got people thinking in at
 

00:15:48.580 --> 00:15:51.390
like this that got people thinking in at
Harvard of course elsewhere too about

00:15:51.390 --> 00:15:51.400
Harvard of course elsewhere too about
 

00:15:51.400 --> 00:15:56.070

these access problems in the short run
 

00:16:01.320 --> 00:16:03.870

systemic market failures but at least
 

00:16:05.590 --> 00:16:08.730
systemic market failures but at least
maybe we can find some way around to

maybe we can find some way around to
 

00:16:08.740 --> 00:16:12.240
maybe we can find some way around to
directly affect the access problem so

00:16:12.240 --> 00:16:12.250
directly affect the access problem so
 

00:16:12.250 --> 00:16:16.200
directly affect the access problem so
because of that in October of 2005 the

00:16:16.200 --> 00:16:16.210
because of that in October of 2005 the

kind of topic that sometimes called the
 

00:16:30.400 --> 00:16:35.460
kind of topic that sometimes called the
serials crisis and in a few months later

00:16:35.460 --> 00:16:35.470
serials crisis and in a few months later
 

00:16:35.470 --> 00:16:40.380

00:16:57.880 --> 00:17:04.199
scholarly communication which was set up
just now just a few months ago the

just now just a few months ago the
 

00:17:04.209 --> 00:17:05.640
just now just a few months ago the
second was that faculties might

second was that faculties might
 

00:17:05.650 --> 00:17:07.740
second was that faculties might
Institute open access policies to

Institute open access policies to
 

00:17:07.750 --> 00:17:13.550
Institute open access policies to
directly address this issue of

Harvard faculty and third that the
 

00:17:21.970 --> 00:17:23.760
Harvard faculty and third that the
university might support open access

00:17:23.760 --> 00:17:23.770
university might support open access

university might support open access
journal charges and I'll come back to

00:17:25.650 --> 00:17:25.660
journal charges and I'll come back to
 

00:17:25.660 --> 00:17:29.100
journal charges and I'll come back to
that towards the end of the talk so

00:17:29.100 --> 00:17:29.110
that towards the end of the talk so
 

00:17:29.110 --> 00:17:31.620
that towards the end of the talk so
mostly I want to talk for the next

00:17:31.620 --> 00:17:31.630
mostly I want to talk for the next
 

00:17:31.630 --> 00:17:32.820
mostly I want to talk for the next
little while about this second

00:17:32.820 --> 00:17:32.830
little while about this second
 

00:17:32.830 --> 00:17:35.220
little while about this second
recommendation that faculties might

00:17:35.220 --> 00:17:35.230
recommendation that faculties might
 

00:17:35.230 --> 00:17:37.140
recommendation that faculties might
Institute open access policies and we

00:17:37.140 --> 00:17:37.150
Institute open access policies and we
 

00:17:37.150 --> 00:17:41.070
Institute open access policies and we
have since done that in two of the about

00:17:41.070 --> 00:17:41.080
have since done that in two of the about
 

00:17:41.080 --> 00:17:46.590
have since done that in two of the about
ten faculties of of the university we've

00:17:46.590 --> 00:17:46.600
ten faculties of of the university we've
 

00:17:46.600 --> 00:17:49.110
ten faculties of of the university we've
instituted up an open access policy in

00:17:49.110 --> 00:17:49.120
instituted up an open access policy in
 

00:17:49.120 --> 00:17:49.830
instituted up an open access policy in
the Faculty of Arts

00:17:49.830 --> 00:17:49.840
the Faculty of Arts
 

00:17:49.840 --> 00:17:51.899
the Faculty of Arts
sciences and in the now in the law

00:17:51.899 --> 00:17:51.909
sciences and in the now in the law
 

00:17:51.909 --> 00:17:54.510
sciences and in the now in the law
school and the Harvard policy has three

00:17:54.510 --> 00:17:54.520
school and the Harvard policy has three
 

00:17:54.520 --> 00:17:59.580
school and the Harvard policy has three
main parts i'll just go over and have we

00:17:59.580 --> 00:17:59.590
main parts i'll just go over and have we
 

00:17:59.590 --> 00:18:01.320
main parts i'll just go over and have we
just get a sense how many people have

00:18:01.320 --> 00:18:01.330
just get a sense how many people have
 

00:18:01.330 --> 00:18:03.590
just get a sense how many people have
heard of this Harvard open access policy

00:18:03.590 --> 00:18:03.600
heard of this Harvard open access policy
 

00:18:03.600 --> 00:18:07.049
heard of this Harvard open access policy
so you may be familiar with with some of

00:18:07.049 --> 00:18:07.059
so you may be familiar with with some of
 

00:18:07.059 --> 00:18:10.370
so you may be familiar with with some of
this but just review there's three

00:18:10.370 --> 00:18:10.380
this but just review there's three
 

00:18:10.380 --> 00:18:13.019
this but just review there's three
important aspects to the policy the

00:18:13.019 --> 00:18:13.029
important aspects to the policy the
 

00:18:13.029 --> 00:18:16.230
important aspects to the policy the
first is that faculty members grant

00:18:16.230 --> 00:18:16.240
first is that faculty members grant
 

00:18:16.240 --> 00:18:17.700
first is that faculty members grant
permission to the University to

00:18:17.700 --> 00:18:17.710
permission to the University to
 

00:18:17.710 --> 00:18:22.590
permission to the University to
distribute their scholarly articles the

00:18:22.590 --> 00:18:22.600
distribute their scholarly articles the
 

00:18:22.600 --> 00:18:25.590
distribute their scholarly articles the
second is that in order to make sure

00:18:25.590 --> 00:18:25.600
second is that in order to make sure
 

00:18:25.600 --> 00:18:29.130
second is that in order to make sure
that the policy cannot stand in the way

00:18:29.130 --> 00:18:29.140
that the policy cannot stand in the way
 

00:18:29.140 --> 00:18:31.789
that the policy cannot stand in the way
of the best interests of the authors a

00:18:31.789 --> 00:18:31.799
of the best interests of the authors a
 

00:18:31.799 --> 00:18:34.110
of the best interests of the authors a
waiver of the policy will be issued for

00:18:34.110 --> 00:18:34.120
waiver of the policy will be issued for
 

00:18:34.120 --> 00:18:36.360
waiver of the policy will be issued for
any article at the sole discretion of

00:18:36.360 --> 00:18:36.370
any article at the sole discretion of
 

00:18:36.370 --> 00:18:39.090
any article at the sole discretion of
the author so there's this process of

00:18:39.090 --> 00:18:39.100
the author so there's this process of
 

00:18:39.100 --> 00:18:41.070
the author so there's this process of
requesting a waiver it's described as a

00:18:41.070 --> 00:18:41.080
requesting a waiver it's described as a
 

00:18:41.080 --> 00:18:42.990
requesting a waiver it's described as a
waiver request for technical reasons

00:18:42.990 --> 00:18:43.000
waiver request for technical reasons
 

00:18:43.000 --> 00:18:47.779
waiver request for technical reasons
it's the the licensee that has to waive

00:18:47.779 --> 00:18:47.789
it's the the licensee that has to waive
 

00:18:47.789 --> 00:18:50.789
it's the the licensee that has to waive
the author can't waive it but so there

00:18:50.789 --> 00:18:50.799
the author can't waive it but so there
 

00:18:50.799 --> 00:18:52.470
the author can't waive it but so there
has to be a request for a waiver but the

entire point of the policy since we

00:19:57.899 --> 00:19:57.909
entire point of the policy since we
 

00:19:57.909 --> 00:20:02.380
entire point of the policy since we
can't rely on the

here so the dash repository is not

00:23:50.269 --> 00:23:50.279
here so the dash repository is not
 

00:23:50.279 --> 00:23:53.869
here so the dash repository is not

the point of the policy is to try to
make it possible to get broader access

these problems in subscription-based
journals so number of advantages of the

it's important that there be the

it's important that there be the

it's important that there be the
broadest possible access to our writings

00:24:43.700 --> 00:24:43.710
broadest possible access to our writings

broadest possible access to our writings
and I put by the way these these

and I put by the way these these
 

00:24:45.809 --> 00:24:47.870

advantages I take them to be in order of
 

00:24:47.880 --> 00:24:50.360
advantages I take them to be in order of
importance so from the most to the least

about the existence of the article and
we may still be able to distribute the

we may still be able to distribute the
 

00:25:38.130 --> 00:25:42.649
we may still be able to distribute the

even without these kinds of addenda
third is that it completely clarifies

00:25:53.960 --> 00:25:53.970
third is that it completely clarifies
 

00:25:53.970 --> 00:25:58.960
third is that it completely clarifies
the right situation for the articles so

00:25:58.960 --> 00:25:58.970
the right situation for the articles so
 

00:25:58.970 --> 00:26:02.390
the right situation for the articles so
for every article we know either it

00:26:02.390 --> 00:26:02.400
for every article we know either it
 

00:26:02.400 --> 00:26:05.840
for every article we know either it
falls under the policy and then

00:26:05.840 --> 00:26:05.850
falls under the policy and then
 

00:26:05.850 --> 00:26:08.270
falls under the policy and then
definitively the university has a right

00:26:08.270 --> 00:26:08.280
definitively the university has a right
 

00:26:08.280 --> 00:26:10.669
definitively the university has a right
to distribute it or a waiver has been

00:26:10.669 --> 00:26:10.679
to distribute it or a waiver has been
 

00:26:10.679 --> 00:26:15.680
to distribute it or a waiver has been
requested and we know the information

00:26:15.680 --> 00:26:15.690
requested and we know the information
 

00:26:15.690 --> 00:26:17.000
requested and we know the information
about the article the journal and the

00:26:17.000 --> 00:26:17.010
about the article the journal and the
 

00:26:17.010 --> 00:26:19.250
about the article the journal and the
publisher and so forth that allows us to

00:26:19.250 --> 00:26:19.260
publisher and so forth that allows us to
 

00:26:19.260 --> 00:26:20.779
publisher and so forth that allows us to
clarify the right situation with respect

00:26:20.779 --> 00:26:20.789
clarify the right situation with respect
 

00:26:20.789 --> 00:26:23.000
clarify the right situation with respect
to that journal and publisher and so

00:26:23.000 --> 00:26:23.010
to that journal and publisher and so
 

00:26:23.010 --> 00:26:24.470
to that journal and publisher and so
we'll know the right situation in either

00:26:24.470 --> 00:26:24.480
we'll know the right situation in either
 

00:26:24.480 --> 00:26:29.270
we'll know the right situation in either
case forth it allows the university to

00:26:29.270 --> 00:26:29.280
case forth it allows the university to
 

00:26:29.280 --> 00:26:30.620
case forth it allows the university to
facilitate the article deposit process

00:26:30.620 --> 00:26:30.630
facilitate the article deposit process
 

00:26:30.630 --> 00:26:32.630
facilitate the article deposit process
because the university actually has a

because the university actually has a
license and fifth it moves some

these three objections two through four

these three objections two through four
 

00:39:42.600 --> 00:39:45.290
these three objections two through four
are based on us on a single scenario

00:39:45.290 --> 00:39:45.300
are based on us on a single scenario
 

00:39:45.300 --> 00:39:48.520
are based on us on a single scenario
which I'll go through on the next slide

00:39:48.520 --> 00:39:48.530
which I'll go through on the next slide
 

00:39:48.530 --> 00:39:50.300
which I'll go through on the next slide
and I want to spend most of my time

00:39:50.300 --> 00:39:50.310
and I want to spend most of my time
 

00:39:50.310 --> 00:39:54.410
and I want to spend most of my time
talking about this objection because I

00:39:54.410 --> 00:39:54.420
talking about this objection because I
 

00:39:54.420 --> 00:39:57.020
talking about this objection because I
think it's a really worth worth while

00:39:57.020 --> 00:39:57.030
think it's a really worth worth while
 

00:39:57.030 --> 00:39:58.850
think it's a really worth worth while
talking about it and it's important and

00:39:58.850 --> 00:39:58.860
talking about it and it's important and
 

00:39:58.860 --> 00:40:02.300
talking about it and it's important and
it's it's not a misguided worry it's an

00:40:02.300 --> 00:40:02.310
it's it's not a misguided worry it's an
 

00:40:02.310 --> 00:40:05.360
it's it's not a misguided worry it's an
important issue to fully understand and

00:40:05.360 --> 00:40:05.370
important issue to fully understand and
 

00:40:05.370 --> 00:40:08.840
important issue to fully understand and
address and then there was a fifth

00:40:08.840 --> 00:40:08.850
address and then there was a fifth
 

00:40:08.850 --> 00:40:11.540
address and then there was a fifth
objection which is that we didn't go far

00:40:11.540 --> 00:40:11.550
objection which is that we didn't go far
 

00:40:11.550 --> 00:40:13.640
objection which is that we didn't go far
enough we should have gone much farther

00:40:13.640 --> 00:40:13.650
enough we should have gone much farther
 

00:40:13.650 --> 00:40:15.910
enough we should have gone much farther
we should have dropped the waiver

00:40:15.910 --> 00:40:15.920
we should have dropped the waiver
 

00:40:15.920 --> 00:40:17.990
we should have dropped the waiver
process that it should have been a

00:40:17.990 --> 00:40:18.000
process that it should have been a
 

00:40:18.000 --> 00:40:22.130

00:40:22.130 --> 00:40:22.140
mandate not just move from an opt-in to
 

00:40:22.140 --> 00:40:23.840
mandate not just move from an opt-in to
an opt-out situation but an actual

mandate at least for the deposit part
 

00:40:26.400 --> 00:40:29.390
mandate at least for the deposit part
now this objection is especially useful

00:40:29.390 --> 00:40:29.400
now this objection is especially useful
 

00:40:29.400 --> 00:40:31.970
now this objection is especially useful
because it's always good to have people

00:40:31.970 --> 00:40:31.980
because it's always good to have people
 

00:40:31.980 --> 00:40:34.340
because it's always good to have people
objecting on both sides of you because

00:40:34.340 --> 00:40:34.350
objecting on both sides of you because
 

00:40:34.350 --> 00:40:36.290
objecting on both sides of you because
then you look completely reasonable if

00:40:36.290 --> 00:40:36.300
then you look completely reasonable if
 

00:40:36.300 --> 00:40:38.000
then you look completely reasonable if
it weren't for this objection people

00:40:38.000 --> 00:40:38.010
it weren't for this objection people
 

00:40:38.010 --> 00:40:40.430
it weren't for this objection people
would think that I'm a nut for proposing

00:40:40.430 --> 00:40:40.440
would think that I'm a nut for proposing
 

00:40:40.440 --> 00:40:42.320
would think that I'm a nut for proposing
this kind of policy but now you can see

00:40:42.320 --> 00:40:42.330
this kind of policy but now you can see
 

00:40:42.330 --> 00:40:45.140
this kind of policy but now you can see
I could have gone even farther so maybe

00:40:45.140 --> 00:40:45.150
I could have gone even farther so maybe
 

00:40:45.150 --> 00:40:47.780
I could have gone even farther so maybe
I'm not so crazy after all okay that's

00:40:47.780 --> 00:40:47.790
I'm not so crazy after all okay that's
 

00:40:47.790 --> 00:40:49.610
I'm not so crazy after all okay that's
all I'll say about that most people want

00:40:49.610 --> 00:40:49.620
all I'll say about that most people want
 

00:40:49.620 --> 00:40:52.520
all I'll say about that most people want
to ask about about that issue but I want

00:40:52.520 --> 00:40:52.530
to ask about about that issue but I want
 

00:40:52.530 --> 00:40:53.660
to ask about about that issue but I want
to concentrate on these those middle

00:40:53.660 --> 00:40:53.670
to concentrate on these those middle
 

00:40:53.670 --> 00:40:56.510
to concentrate on these those middle
objections that had to do with this kind

00:40:56.510 --> 00:40:56.520
objections that had to do with this kind
 

00:40:56.520 --> 00:40:58.910
objections that had to do with this kind
of dystopian scenario that people worry

of dystopian scenario that people worry
 

00:40:58.920 --> 00:41:04.130
of dystopian scenario that people worry
about so here's the here's this those of

about so here's the here's this those of
 

00:41:04.140 --> 00:41:06.050
about so here's the here's this those of
that those kinds of objections that this

00:41:06.050 --> 00:41:06.060
that those kinds of objections that this
 

00:41:06.060 --> 00:41:08.230
that those kinds of objections that this
will this will harm peer review it will

of this policy not the policy itself so

00:41:22.540 --> 00:41:22.550
of this policy not the policy itself so
 

00:41:22.550 --> 00:41:25.630
of this policy not the policy itself so
the first issue is we have to imagine

00:41:25.630 --> 00:41:25.640
the first issue is we have to imagine
 

00:41:25.640 --> 00:41:29.630
the first issue is we have to imagine
that at some time in the more or less

00:41:29.630 --> 00:41:29.640
that at some time in the more or less
 

00:41:29.640 --> 00:41:32.630

distant future many years from now
 

00:41:32.640 --> 00:41:35.049
distant future many years from now
all universities will have followed suit

00:41:35.049 --> 00:41:35.059
all universities will have followed suit
 

00:41:35.059 --> 00:41:37.160
all universities will have followed suit
following Harvard Harvard likes to

00:41:37.160 --> 00:41:37.170
following Harvard Harvard likes to
 

00:41:37.170 --> 00:41:43.130
following Harvard Harvard likes to
imagine that we control in some manner

00:41:43.130 --> 00:41:43.140
imagine that we control in some manner
 

00:41:43.140 --> 00:41:45.680
imagine that we control in some manner

through moral suasion or something how
 

00:41:45.690 --> 00:41:48.230
through moral suasion or something how
other universities act but you of course

00:41:48.230 --> 00:41:48.240
other universities act but you of course
 

00:41:48.240 --> 00:41:53.960
other universities act but you of course
no it's not true we tried for instance

00:41:53.960 --> 00:41:53.970
no it's not true we tried for instance
 

00:41:53.970 --> 00:41:58.519
no it's not true we tried for instance
to to get rid of early action for

00:41:58.519 --> 00:41:58.529
to to get rid of early action for
 

00:41:58.529 --> 00:42:00.410
to to get rid of early action for
undergraduate admissions need a big

00:42:00.410 --> 00:42:00.420
undergraduate admissions need a big
 

00:42:00.420 --> 00:42:02.710
undergraduate admissions need a big
announcement we work into early action

00:42:02.710 --> 00:42:02.720
announcement we work into early action
 

00:42:02.720 --> 00:42:04.730
announcement we work into early action
I've been a lot of discussion of early

00:42:04.730 --> 00:42:04.740
I've been a lot of discussion of early
 

00:42:04.740 --> 00:42:07.190
I've been a lot of discussion of early
action before then how early action was

00:42:07.190 --> 00:42:07.200
action before then how early action was
 

00:42:07.200 --> 00:42:10.250
action before then how early action was
problematic and and all the universities

00:42:10.250 --> 00:42:10.260
problematic and and all the universities
 

00:42:10.260 --> 00:42:12.410
problematic and and all the universities
should get rid of it and if just someone

00:42:12.410 --> 00:42:12.420
should get rid of it and if just someone
 

00:42:12.420 --> 00:42:14.240
should get rid of it and if just someone
would go first then we'd all follow and

00:42:14.240 --> 00:42:14.250
would go first then we'd all follow and
 

00:42:14.250 --> 00:42:16.130
would go first then we'd all follow and
so Harvard said okay we'll go first and

00:42:16.130 --> 00:42:16.140
so Harvard said okay we'll go first and
 

00:42:16.140 --> 00:42:19.279
so Harvard said okay we'll go first and
we got rid of early action nothing of it

00:42:19.279 --> 00:42:19.289
we got rid of early action nothing of it
 

00:42:19.289 --> 00:42:23.000
we got rid of early action nothing of it

can't limit access anymore isn't so you
 

00:47:38.670 --> 00:47:40.520
can't limit access anymore isn't so you
can't charge for it so you have to find

simultaneously extrapolate the Harvard
compact you notice the risk to the

00:54:59.339 --> 00:54:59.349
compact you notice the risk to the
 

00:54:59.349 --> 00:55:01.890
compact you notice the risk to the
publisher of changing models from a

the journal doesn't have to wonder

00:55:12.500 --> 00:55:12.510
the journal doesn't have to wonder
 

00:55:12.510 --> 00:55:16.079
the journal doesn't have to wonder
whether authors will move to some other

the publisher will know that the

to paying article processing fees so the
 

00:55:30.010 --> 00:55:34.650
to paying article processing fees so the
risk is mitigated there are lot of

00:55:34.650 --> 00:55:34.660
risk is mitigated there are lot of
 

00:55:34.660 --> 00:55:38.579

we can talk about what articles would be

00:55:45.750 --> 00:55:45.760
we can talk about what articles would be
 

00:55:45.760 --> 00:55:48.690
we can talk about what articles would be
eligible what's the fee structure what

00:55:48.690 --> 00:55:48.700
eligible what's the fee structure what
 

00:55:48.700 --> 00:55:50.760

of various sorts and how the puff policy
 

00:55:58.359 --> 00:56:01.800
of various sorts and how the puff policy
would be reviewed and so forth but maybe

00:56:01.800 --> 00:56:01.810
would be reviewed and so forth but maybe
 

00:56:01.810 --> 00:56:04.500
would be reviewed and so forth but maybe
I will not go into great detail here and

00:56:04.500 --> 00:56:04.510
I will not go into great detail here and
 

00:56:04.510 --> 00:56:07.020
I will not go into great detail here and
kind of leave that to these questions to

00:56:07.020 --> 00:56:07.030
kind of leave that to these questions to
 

00:56:07.030 --> 00:56:10.220
kind of leave that to these questions to
arise during during the question period

00:56:10.220 --> 00:56:10.230
arise during during the question period
 

00:56:10.230 --> 00:56:14.250
arise during during the question period
a couple of objections people might

00:56:14.250 --> 00:56:14.260
a couple of objections people might
 

00:56:14.260 --> 00:56:16.140
a couple of objections people might
think of which we can also talk about I

00:56:16.140 --> 00:56:16.150
think of which we can also talk about I
 

00:56:16.150 --> 00:56:18.420
think of which we can also talk about I
won't go into now one objection might be

00:56:18.420 --> 00:56:18.430
won't go into now one objection might be
 

00:56:18.430 --> 00:56:21.030
won't go into now one objection might be
well maybe Harvard could afford the

00:56:21.030 --> 00:56:21.040
well maybe Harvard could afford the
 

00:56:21.040 --> 00:56:23.099
well maybe Harvard could afford the
Harvard compact of underwriting these

00:56:23.099 --> 00:56:23.109
Harvard compact of underwriting these
 

00:56:23.109 --> 00:56:25.650
Harvard compact of underwriting these
open access publication fees but not too

00:56:25.650 --> 00:56:25.660
open access publication fees but not too
 

00:56:25.660 --> 00:56:27.300
open access publication fees but not too
many other universities could afford it

00:56:27.300 --> 00:56:27.310
many other universities could afford it
 

00:56:27.310 --> 00:56:29.300
many other universities could afford it
it'll be it'll be just hugely expensive

00:56:29.300 --> 00:56:29.310
it'll be it'll be just hugely expensive
 

00:56:29.310 --> 00:56:31.770
it'll be it'll be just hugely expensive
so that's a worry that we might have we

00:56:31.770 --> 00:56:31.780
so that's a worry that we might have we
 

00:56:31.780 --> 00:56:34.170
so that's a worry that we might have we
can talk about that there is it kind of

00:56:34.170 --> 00:56:34.180
can talk about that there is it kind of
 

00:56:34.180 --> 00:56:36.990
can talk about that there is it kind of
a converse worry is well this only works

00:56:36.990 --> 00:56:37.000
a converse worry is well this only works
 

00:56:37.000 --> 00:56:40.109
a converse worry is well this only works
if there's universal acceptance of the

00:56:40.109 --> 00:56:40.119
if there's universal acceptance of the
 

00:56:40.119 --> 00:56:43.470
if there's universal acceptance of the
of the compact very different from the

00:56:43.470 --> 00:56:43.480
of the compact very different from the
 

00:56:43.480 --> 00:56:45.329
of the compact very different from the
open access policy open access policy

00:56:45.329 --> 00:56:45.339
open access policy open access policy
 

00:56:45.339 --> 00:56:47.130
open access policy open access policy
works in Harvard faculties interest even

00:56:47.130 --> 00:56:47.140
works in Harvard faculties interest even
 

00:56:47.140 --> 00:56:49.170
works in Harvard faculties interest even
if our word is the only University that

00:56:49.170 --> 00:56:49.180
if our word is the only University that
 

00:56:49.180 --> 00:56:52.320
if our word is the only University that
has such a policy but here the whole

00:56:52.320 --> 00:56:52.330
has such a policy but here the whole
 

00:56:52.330 --> 00:56:54.480
has such a policy but here the whole
basis for the idea is that it would be

00:56:54.480 --> 00:56:54.490
basis for the idea is that it would be
 

00:56:54.490 --> 00:57:00.549
basis for the idea is that it would be
taken up wholesale so

00:57:00.549 --> 00:57:00.559
 
 

00:57:00.559 --> 00:57:06.130
 
we can talk about those two let me just

00:57:06.130 --> 00:57:06.140
we can talk about those two let me just
 

00:57:06.140 --> 00:57:09.699
we can talk about those two let me just
summarize maybe with the main points

00:57:09.699 --> 00:57:09.709
summarize maybe with the main points
 

00:57:09.709 --> 00:57:13.839
summarize maybe with the main points
were here in this in this talk and then

00:57:13.839 --> 00:57:13.849
were here in this in this talk and then
 

00:57:13.849 --> 00:57:16.329
were here in this in this talk and then
we'll open up to questions first thing I

00:57:16.329 --> 00:57:16.339
we'll open up to questions first thing I
 

00:57:16.339 --> 00:57:19.089
we'll open up to questions first thing I
want to emphasize is that this is a

00:57:19.089 --> 00:57:19.099
want to emphasize is that this is a
 

00:57:19.099 --> 00:57:23.499
want to emphasize is that this is a
university faculty problem that this

00:57:23.499 --> 00:57:23.509
university faculty problem that this
 

00:57:23.509 --> 00:57:26.410
university faculty problem that this
this problem of dysfunction in the

00:57:26.410 --> 00:57:26.420
this problem of dysfunction in the
 

00:57:26.420 --> 00:57:28.539
this problem of dysfunction in the
scholarly communication system and it

00:57:28.539 --> 00:57:28.549
scholarly communication system and it
 

00:57:28.549 --> 00:57:31.509
scholarly communication system and it
requires University and faculty action

00:57:31.509 --> 00:57:31.519
requires University and faculty action
 

00:57:31.519 --> 00:57:33.789
requires University and faculty action
to resolve it it's not as it sometimes

00:57:33.789 --> 00:57:33.799
to resolve it it's not as it sometimes
 

00:57:33.799 --> 00:57:36.939
to resolve it it's not as it sometimes
has been described a library problem

00:57:36.939 --> 00:57:36.949
has been described a library problem
 

00:57:36.949 --> 00:57:41.170
has been described a library problem
that requires library action the second

00:57:41.170 --> 00:57:41.180
that requires library action the second
 

00:57:41.180 --> 00:57:42.579
that requires library action the second
is there are two parts to the problem

00:57:42.579 --> 00:57:42.589
is there are two parts to the problem
 

00:57:42.589 --> 00:57:46.349
is there are two parts to the problem
there's an access problem and for that

00:57:46.349 --> 00:57:46.359
there's an access problem and for that
 

00:57:46.359 --> 00:57:48.849
there's an access problem and for that
we hope that this Harvard open access

00:57:48.849 --> 00:57:48.859
we hope that this Harvard open access
 

00:57:48.859 --> 00:57:52.420
we hope that this Harvard open access
policy will mitigate the access problem

00:57:52.420 --> 00:57:52.430
policy will mitigate the access problem
 

00:57:52.430 --> 00:57:54.789
policy will mitigate the access problem
but there's also a separate business

00:57:54.789 --> 00:57:54.799
but there's also a separate business
 

00:57:54.799 --> 00:57:57.969
but there's also a separate business
model problem that the that the Harvard

00:57:57.969 --> 00:57:57.979
model problem that the that the Harvard
 

00:57:57.979 --> 00:57:59.529
model problem that the that the Harvard
open access policy has nothing to do

00:57:59.529 --> 00:57:59.539
open access policy has nothing to do
 

00:57:59.539 --> 00:58:04.449
open access policy has nothing to do
with and the hope there is that that can

00:58:04.449 --> 00:58:04.459
with and the hope there is that that can
 

00:58:04.459 --> 00:58:05.799
with and the hope there is that that can
be at least partially mitigated by the

00:58:05.799 --> 00:58:05.809
be at least partially mitigated by the
 

00:58:05.809 --> 00:58:09.489
be at least partially mitigated by the
Harvard compact so let me stop there and

00:58:09.489 --> 00:58:09.499
Harvard compact so let me stop there and
 

00:58:09.499 --> 00:58:11.679
Harvard compact so let me stop there and
I'll take questions on any or all of

00:58:11.679 --> 00:58:11.689
I'll take questions on any or all of
 

00:58:11.689 --> 00:58:18.309
I'll take questions on any or all of
these topics yeah I know are you think

00:58:18.309 --> 00:58:18.319
these topics yeah I know are you think
 

00:58:18.319 --> 00:58:19.929
these topics yeah I know are you think
about this news you mentioned articles

00:58:19.929 --> 00:58:19.939
about this news you mentioned articles
 

00:58:19.939 --> 00:58:21.789
about this news you mentioned articles
of the outset is this doesn't apply

00:58:21.789 --> 00:58:21.799
of the outset is this doesn't apply

folks that are respectable the

00:58:23.829 --> 00:58:23.839
folks that are respectable the
 

00:58:23.839 --> 00:58:26.380
folks that are respectable the
publishing industry we decided

00:58:26.380 --> 00:58:26.390
publishing industry we decided
 

00:58:26.390 --> 00:58:29.049
publishing industry we decided
they go to show the academic publishing

00:58:29.049 --> 00:58:29.059
they go to show the academic publishing
 

00:58:29.059 --> 00:58:31.269
they go to show the academic publishing
industry of books has its own set a

00:58:31.269 --> 00:58:31.279
industry of books has its own set a
 

00:58:31.279 --> 00:58:34.569
industry of books has its own set a
problem if there is indeed yeah the

00:58:34.569 --> 00:58:34.579
problem if there is indeed yeah the
 

00:58:34.579 --> 00:58:38.559
problem if there is indeed yeah the
question whether whether this Harvard

00:58:38.559 --> 00:58:38.569
question whether whether this Harvard
 

00:58:38.569 --> 00:58:40.809
question whether whether this Harvard
open access probably pies to books the

00:58:40.809 --> 00:58:40.819
open access probably pies to books the
 

00:58:40.819 --> 00:58:43.059
open access probably pies to books the
book publishing industry academic book

00:58:43.059 --> 00:58:43.069
book publishing industry academic book
 

00:58:43.069 --> 00:58:45.430
book publishing industry academic book
publishing she has its own problems I

00:58:45.430 --> 00:58:45.440
publishing she has its own problems I
 

00:58:45.440 --> 00:58:47.019
publishing she has its own problems I
think their problems of a different sort

00:58:47.019 --> 00:58:47.029
think their problems of a different sort
 

00:58:47.029 --> 00:58:53.819
think their problems of a different sort
from the journal publishing system and

00:58:53.819 --> 00:58:53.829
from the journal publishing system and
 

00:58:53.829 --> 00:58:57.339
from the journal publishing system and
therefore requires different solutions

00:58:57.339 --> 00:58:57.349
therefore requires different solutions
 

00:58:57.349 --> 00:58:59.470
therefore requires different solutions
the Harvard open access policy does not

00:58:59.470 --> 00:58:59.480
the Harvard open access policy does not
 

00:58:59.480 --> 00:59:03.430
the Harvard open access policy does not
apply to books it applies only to what

00:59:03.430 --> 00:59:03.440
apply to books it applies only to what
 

00:59:03.440 --> 00:59:05.650
apply to books it applies only to what
we refer to as scholarly articles so

00:59:05.650 --> 00:59:05.660
we refer to as scholarly articles so
 

00:59:05.660 --> 00:59:07.779
we refer to as scholarly articles so
these are and you can think of what the

00:59:07.779 --> 00:59:07.789
these are and you can think of what the
 

00:59:07.789 --> 00:59:09.900
these are and you can think of what the
core cases of scholarly articles are

00:59:09.900 --> 00:59:09.910
core cases of scholarly articles are
 

00:59:09.910 --> 00:59:13.359
core cases of scholarly articles are
articles in scholarly journals refereed

00:59:13.359 --> 00:59:13.369

conference proceedings that that kind of
 

00:59:15.890 --> 00:59:20.049
conference proceedings that that kind of
thing not popular articles not books

00:59:20.049 --> 00:59:20.059

journals work entirely and maybe get rid
 

01:08:29.469 --> 01:08:33.120
journals work entirely and maybe get rid
of them and so forth is that it's not

that model and we don't know about about
 

01:08:55.989 --> 01:08:58.950
that model and we don't know about about
alternatives and so you guy said well we

01:08:58.950 --> 01:08:58.960
alternatives and so you guy said well we
 

01:08:58.960 --> 01:09:00.419

of getting this resolution adopted it at
Harvard and so I'd like to hear some

01:13:58.670 --> 01:13:58.680
Harvard and so I'd like to hear some
 

01:13:58.680 --> 01:14:01.910
Harvard and so I'd like to hear some
trench warfare stories yeah some some

01:14:01.910 --> 01:14:01.920
trench warfare stories yeah some some
 

01:14:01.920 --> 01:14:04.940
trench warfare stories yeah some some
some lessons learned about what works

01:14:04.940 --> 01:14:04.950
some lessons learned about what works
 

01:14:04.950 --> 01:14:07.640
some lessons learned about what works
what doesn't work as you move this

01:14:07.640 --> 01:14:07.650
what doesn't work as you move this
 

01:14:07.650 --> 01:14:10.160
what doesn't work as you move this
resolution forward and then I know there

01:14:10.160 --> 01:14:10.170
resolution forward and then I know there
 

01:14:10.170 --> 01:14:11.810
resolution forward and then I know there
hasn't been much time since its adoption

01:14:11.810 --> 01:14:11.820
hasn't been much time since its adoption
 

01:14:11.820 --> 01:14:15.860
hasn't been much time since its adoption
but any episodes about what works what

01:14:15.860 --> 01:14:15.870
but any episodes about what works what
 

01:14:15.870 --> 01:14:17.150
but any episodes about what works what
doesn't work now that you're

01:14:17.150 --> 01:14:17.160
doesn't work now that you're
 

01:14:17.160 --> 01:14:22.880
doesn't work now that you're
implementing it yeah so it's a good

01:14:22.880 --> 01:14:22.890
implementing it yeah so it's a good
 

01:14:22.890 --> 01:14:24.710
implementing it yeah so it's a good
question what was it that made it

01:14:24.710 --> 01:14:24.720
question what was it that made it
 

01:14:24.720 --> 01:14:30.290
question what was it that made it
possible to get this policy past in fact

01:14:30.290 --> 01:14:30.300

of considering such a policy some are

01:14:54.980 --> 01:14:54.990
of considering such a policy some are
 

01:14:54.990 --> 01:14:56.780
of considering such a policy some are
farther along than others and it's going

01:14:56.780 --> 01:14:56.790
farther along than others and it's going
 

01:14:56.790 --> 01:14:59.210
farther along than others and it's going
to take a long time for them to I don't

01:14:59.210 --> 01:14:59.220
to take a long time for them to I don't
 

01:14:59.220 --> 01:15:02.750
to take a long time for them to I don't
know exactly how long maybe we'll be

01:15:02.750 --> 01:15:02.760
know exactly how long maybe we'll be
 

01:15:02.760 --> 01:15:05.780

able to this academic year some other
 

01:15:05.790 --> 01:15:08.030
able to this academic year some other
schools will join in maybe not I don't

01:15:08.030 --> 01:15:08.040
schools will join in maybe not I don't
 

01:15:08.040 --> 01:15:12.290
schools will join in maybe not I don't
know it's it's a long process and it's

01:15:12.290 --> 01:15:12.300
know it's it's a long process and it's
 

01:15:12.300 --> 01:15:16.100
know it's it's a long process and it's
important that it be a certain size it

01:15:16.100 --> 01:15:16.110
important that it be a certain size it
 

01:15:16.110 --> 01:15:17.960
important that it be a certain size it
won't be a long process or that there be

01:15:17.960 --> 01:15:17.970
won't be a long process or that there be
 

01:15:17.970 --> 01:15:21.920
won't be a long process or that there be
patience because you really need a very

01:15:21.920 --> 01:15:21.930
patience because you really need a very
 

01:15:21.930 --> 01:15:24.260
patience because you really need a very
full discussion and everyone to become

01:15:24.260 --> 01:15:24.270
full discussion and everyone to become
 

01:15:24.270 --> 01:15:27.830
full discussion and everyone to become
comfortable with the idea it it's it

01:15:27.830 --> 01:15:27.840
comfortable with the idea it it's it
 

01:15:27.840 --> 01:15:31.640

doesn't do any good to tactically get

01:15:31.640 --> 01:15:31.650
doesn't do any good to tactically get
 

01:15:31.650 --> 01:15:34.130
doesn't do any good to tactically get
something passed if there isn't really

01:15:34.130 --> 01:15:34.140
something passed if there isn't really
 

01:15:34.140 --> 01:15:42.350
something passed if there isn't really
wide support for it because you can you

01:15:42.350 --> 01:15:42.360
wide support for it because you can you
 

01:15:42.360 --> 01:15:43.760
wide support for it because you can you
can pass certain policies or you can

01:15:43.760 --> 01:15:43.770
can pass certain policies or you can
 

01:15:43.770 --> 01:15:46.550
can pass certain policies or you can
declare certain policies it doesn't

01:15:46.550 --> 01:15:46.560
declare certain policies it doesn't
 

01:15:46.560 --> 01:15:49.310
declare certain policies it doesn't
matter if people are not actually behind

01:15:49.310 --> 01:15:49.320
matter if people are not actually behind
 

01:15:49.320 --> 01:15:54.870
matter if people are not actually behind
them they won't have any effect so

01:15:54.870 --> 01:15:54.880
 
 

01:15:54.880 --> 01:15:59.950
 
so it's important to be patient next

01:15:59.950 --> 01:15:59.960
so it's important to be patient next
 

01:15:59.960 --> 01:16:03.609
so it's important to be patient next
thing I say is it turned out important

01:16:03.609 --> 01:16:03.619
thing I say is it turned out important
 

01:16:03.619 --> 01:16:08.790

01:16:08.800 --> 01:16:13.600
to the the wording of the policy is very
important in particular this a waiver

01:16:13.600 --> 01:16:13.610
important in particular this a waiver
 

01:16:13.610 --> 01:16:17.290
important in particular this a waiver
ability was crucial I'm getting people

01:16:17.290 --> 01:16:17.300
ability was crucial I'm getting people
 

01:16:17.300 --> 01:16:19.810
ability was crucial I'm getting people
comfortable that there wouldn't be

01:17:25.390 --> 01:17:25.400
one well not so fast there you know we
 

01:17:25.400 --> 01:17:27.879
one well not so fast there you know we
should at least share and and now we're

01:17:27.879 --> 01:17:27.889
should at least share and and now we're
 

01:17:27.889 --> 01:17:30.729
should at least share and and now we're
arguing over the percentage does the

01:17:30.729 --> 01:17:30.739
arguing over the percentage does the
 

01:17:30.739 --> 01:17:32.890
arguing over the percentage does the
faculty member get fifty percent or

01:17:32.890 --> 01:17:32.900
faculty member get fifty percent or
 

01:17:32.900 --> 01:17:34.930
faculty member get fifty percent or
twenty-five percent or ten percent and

twenty-five percent or ten percent and
 

01:17:34.940 --> 01:17:39.160
twenty-five percent or ten percent and
it becomes an adversarial situation it

01:17:39.160 --> 01:17:39.170
it becomes an adversarial situation it
 

01:17:39.170 --> 01:17:41.290
it becomes an adversarial situation it
you don't want it perceived that way and

01:17:41.290 --> 01:17:41.300
you don't want it perceived that way and
 

01:17:41.300 --> 01:17:43.740
you don't want it perceived that way and
it has to be perceived as the faculty

01:17:43.740 --> 01:17:43.750
it has to be perceived as the faculty
 

01:17:43.750 --> 01:17:46.870
it has to be perceived as the faculty
doing this on their own behalf that's

01:17:46.870 --> 01:17:46.880
doing this on their own behalf that's
 

01:17:46.880 --> 01:17:50.709
doing this on their own behalf that's
probably the most crucial aspect so

01:17:50.709 --> 01:17:50.719
probably the most crucial aspect so
 

01:17:50.719 --> 01:17:56.439
probably the most crucial aspect so
there's there's a couple of three things

01:17:56.439 --> 01:17:56.449
there's there's a couple of three things
 

01:17:56.449 --> 01:17:59.200
there's there's a couple of three things
that I think led to the possibility of

01:17:59.200 --> 01:17:59.210
that I think led to the possibility of
 

01:17:59.210 --> 01:18:01.569
that I think led to the possibility of
doing this in FAS and we're continuing

01:18:01.569 --> 01:18:01.579
doing this in FAS and we're continuing
 

01:18:01.579 --> 01:18:04.089
doing this in FAS and we're continuing
to use the same kind of method where we

01:18:04.089 --> 01:18:04.099
to use the same kind of method where we
 

01:18:04.099 --> 01:18:07.880
to use the same kind of method where we
introduce it to an individual faculty we

01:18:07.880 --> 01:18:07.890
introduce it to an individual faculty we
 

01:18:07.890 --> 01:18:09.380
introduce it to an individual faculty we
the faculty talk about it we have

01:18:09.380 --> 01:18:09.390
the faculty talk about it we have
 

01:18:09.390 --> 01:18:11.090
the faculty talk about it we have
meetings to talk about it we bring in

01:18:11.090 --> 01:18:11.100
meetings to talk about it we bring in
 

01:18:11.100 --> 01:18:14.900
meetings to talk about it we bring in
another faculty to describe the point of

01:18:14.900 --> 01:18:14.910
another faculty to describe the point of
 

01:18:14.910 --> 01:18:20.180
another faculty to describe the point of
it and so forth let things kind of the

one that rises astronomically rear but
 

01:18:37.140 --> 01:18:38.480

we still sort of know how much we've

01:18:38.480 --> 01:18:38.490
we still sort of know how much we've
 

01:18:38.490 --> 01:18:40.190
we still sort of know how much we've
budgeted for that and in the business

01:18:40.190 --> 01:18:40.200
budgeted for that and in the business
 

01:18:40.200 --> 01:18:42.650
budgeted for that and in the business
model you're proposing the cost of

01:18:42.650 --> 01:18:42.660
model you're proposing the cost of
 

01:18:42.660 --> 01:18:44.270
model you're proposing the cost of
subsidizing the author fees is not

01:18:44.270 --> 01:18:44.280
subsidizing the author fees is not
 

01:18:44.280 --> 01:18:47.960
subsidizing the author fees is not
predictable so you can't say well you

01:18:47.960 --> 01:18:47.970
predictable so you can't say well you
 

01:18:47.970 --> 01:18:49.880
predictable so you can't say well you
know we'll have X number of articles in

01:18:49.880 --> 01:18:49.890
know we'll have X number of articles in
 

01:18:49.890 --> 01:18:52.130
know we'll have X number of articles in
a given year how would the university

01:18:52.130 --> 01:18:52.140
a given year how would the university
 

01:18:52.140 --> 01:18:54.140
a given year how would the university
budget for this is first question just

01:18:54.140 --> 01:18:54.150
budget for this is first question just
 

01:18:54.150 --> 01:18:58.010
budget for this is first question just
removing that out and then long-term are

01:18:58.010 --> 01:18:58.020
removing that out and then long-term are
 

01:18:58.020 --> 01:19:01.280
removing that out and then long-term are
we setting up a situation in which I'll

01:19:01.280 --> 01:19:01.290
we setting up a situation in which I'll
 

01:19:01.290 --> 01:19:02.510
we setting up a situation in which I'll
just say the large libraries are

01:19:02.510 --> 01:19:02.520
just say the large libraries are
 

01:19:02.520 --> 01:19:04.310
just say the large libraries are
subsidizing the smaller libraries or the

01:19:04.310 --> 01:19:04.320
subsidizing the smaller libraries or the
 

01:19:04.320 --> 01:19:05.930
subsidizing the smaller libraries or the
large universities are subsidizing the

01:19:05.930 --> 01:19:05.940
large universities are subsidizing the
 

01:19:05.940 --> 01:19:08.330
large universities are subsidizing the
smaller universities yeah so so those

01:19:08.330 --> 01:19:08.340
smaller universities yeah so so those
 

01:19:08.340 --> 01:19:10.490
smaller universities yeah so so those
are two extremely good questions so

01:19:10.490 --> 01:19:10.500
are two extremely good questions so
 

01:19:10.500 --> 01:19:12.350
are two extremely good questions so
let's talk about you know the prediction

01:19:12.350 --> 01:19:12.360
let's talk about you know the prediction
 

01:19:12.360 --> 01:19:14.450
let's talk about you know the prediction
problem so you say well we know how much

01:19:14.450 --> 01:19:14.460
problem so you say well we know how much
 

01:19:14.460 --> 01:19:15.890
problem so you say well we know how much
it's going to cost from year to year for

01:19:15.890 --> 01:19:15.900
it's going to cost from year to year for
 

01:19:15.900 --> 01:19:17.330
it's going to cost from year to year for
cereals of course you don't know because

01:19:17.330 --> 01:19:17.340
cereals of course you don't know because
 

01:19:17.340 --> 01:19:20.600
cereals of course you don't know because
sure what I spent this year plus okay

01:19:20.600 --> 01:19:20.610
sure what I spent this year plus okay
 

01:19:20.610 --> 01:19:22.340
sure what I spent this year plus okay
yeah plus what that's the question so

01:19:22.340 --> 01:19:22.350
yeah plus what that's the question so
 

01:19:22.350 --> 01:19:25.160
yeah plus what that's the question so
you don't know because you renegotiate

01:19:25.160 --> 01:19:25.170
you don't know because you renegotiate
 

01:19:25.170 --> 01:19:27.710
you don't know because you renegotiate
the contracts all the time and you're

01:19:27.710 --> 01:19:27.720
the contracts all the time and you're
 

01:19:27.720 --> 01:19:31.510
the contracts all the time and you're
renegotiating them one by one every the

01:19:31.510 --> 01:19:31.520
renegotiating them one by one every the
 

01:19:31.520 --> 01:19:33.470
renegotiating them one by one every the
publishers do perfect price

01:19:33.470 --> 01:19:33.480

discrimination every university sees a

01:19:36.200 --> 01:19:36.210
discrimination every university sees a
 

01:19:36.210 --> 01:19:38.060

different price when ago she ate each

01:19:38.060 --> 01:19:38.070

individual University separately where
you put together consorcio and so forth

01:19:42.170 --> 01:19:42.180
you put together consorcio and so forth
 

01:19:42.180 --> 01:19:43.160
you put together consorcio and so forth
it only makes things even more

01:19:43.160 --> 01:19:43.170
it only makes things even more
 

01:19:43.170 --> 01:19:46.520
it only makes things even more
complicated to predict so you would you

01:19:46.520 --> 01:19:46.530
complicated to predict so you would you
 

01:19:46.530 --> 01:19:47.720
complicated to predict so you would you
have a sense and you have a sense

01:19:47.720 --> 01:19:47.730
have a sense and you have a sense
 

01:19:47.730 --> 01:19:50.240
have a sense and you have a sense
because you know you're doing so many

01:19:50.240 --> 01:19:50.250
because you know you're doing so many
 

01:19:50.250 --> 01:19:51.770
because you know you're doing so many
journals and so many publishers that

01:19:51.770 --> 01:19:51.780
journals and so many publishers that
 

01:19:51.780 --> 01:19:53.300
journals and so many publishers that
thing's kind of watch out and you can

01:19:53.300 --> 01:19:53.310
thing's kind of watch out and you can
 

01:19:53.310 --> 01:19:54.530
thing's kind of watch out and you can
say well it's probably overall it's

01:19:54.530 --> 01:19:54.540
say well it's probably overall it's
 

01:19:54.540 --> 01:19:56.630
say well it's probably overall it's
going to go you know ten percent more

01:19:56.630 --> 01:19:56.640
going to go you know ten percent more
 

01:19:56.640 --> 01:19:57.890
going to go you know ten percent more
this year than last year or whatever the

01:19:57.890 --> 01:19:57.900
this year than last year or whatever the
 

01:19:57.900 --> 01:20:00.050
this year than last year or whatever the
numbers and maybe so we'll have to

01:20:00.050 --> 01:20:00.060
numbers and maybe so we'll have to
 

01:20:00.060 --> 01:20:03.290
numbers and maybe so we'll have to
cancel mmm such-and-such percentage of

01:20:03.290 --> 01:20:03.300
cancel mmm such-and-such percentage of
 

01:20:03.300 --> 01:20:08.360
cancel mmm such-and-such percentage of

01:20:08.360 --> 01:20:08.370
so the same thing extrapolating now this
 

01:20:08.370 --> 01:20:11.240
so the same thing extrapolating now this
Harvard compact idea the same thing

01:20:11.240 --> 01:20:11.250
Harvard compact idea the same thing
 

01:20:11.250 --> 01:20:12.860
Harvard compact idea the same thing
would happen you'd have a sense from

01:20:12.860 --> 01:20:12.870
would happen you'd have a sense from
 

01:20:12.870 --> 01:20:15.140
would happen you'd have a sense from
year to year how many articles we know

01:20:15.140 --> 01:20:15.150
year to year how many articles we know
 

01:20:15.150 --> 01:20:20.270
year to year how many articles we know
we know uh actually we don't one could

01:20:20.270 --> 01:20:20.280
we know uh actually we don't one could
 

01:20:20.280 --> 01:20:21.500
we know uh actually we don't one could
figure out if we

01:20:21.500 --> 01:20:21.510
figure out if we
 

01:20:21.510 --> 01:20:23.810
figure out if we
had some sensible reporting method how

01:20:23.810 --> 01:20:23.820
had some sensible reporting method how
 

01:20:23.820 --> 01:20:26.750
had some sensible reporting method how
many articles FAS faculty publish a year

01:20:26.750 --> 01:20:26.760
many articles FAS faculty publish a year
 

01:20:26.760 --> 01:20:30.740
many articles FAS faculty publish a year
and that number doesn't vary hugely from

01:20:30.740 --> 01:20:30.750
and that number doesn't vary hugely from
 

01:20:30.750 --> 01:20:32.390
and that number doesn't vary hugely from
year to year it does vary em there's

01:20:32.390 --> 01:20:32.400
year to year it does vary em there's
 

01:20:32.400 --> 01:20:35.180
year to year it does vary em there's
some statistical fluctuation but the

01:20:35.180 --> 01:20:35.190
some statistical fluctuation but the
 

01:20:35.190 --> 01:20:37.400
some statistical fluctuation but the
number of articles you know number of

01:20:37.400 --> 01:20:37.410
number of articles you know number of
 

01:20:37.410 --> 01:20:39.500
number of articles you know number of
articles per faculty member per year is

01:20:39.500 --> 01:20:39.510
articles per faculty member per year is
 

01:20:39.510 --> 01:20:45.890
articles per faculty member per year is
in you know relatively stable number if

01:20:45.890 --> 01:20:45.900
in you know relatively stable number if
 

01:20:45.900 --> 01:20:48.470
in you know relatively stable number if
you imagine all of them were being you

01:20:48.470 --> 01:20:48.480
you imagine all of them were being you
 

01:20:48.480 --> 01:20:51.890
you imagine all of them were being you
know there over time these things will

01:20:51.890 --> 01:20:51.900
know there over time these things will
 

01:20:51.900 --> 01:20:56.420
know there over time these things will
shake out that the number of articles is

01:20:56.420 --> 01:20:56.430
shake out that the number of articles is
 

01:20:56.430 --> 01:21:00.070
shake out that the number of articles is
stable over time that's probably true

01:21:00.070 --> 01:21:00.080
stable over time that's probably true
 

01:21:00.080 --> 01:21:04.760
stable over time that's probably true
aggregate yeah yeah and I wish I could

01:21:04.760 --> 01:21:04.770
aggregate yeah yeah and I wish I could
 

01:21:04.770 --> 01:21:05.690
aggregate yeah yeah and I wish I could
give you a more accurate information

01:21:05.690 --> 01:21:05.700
give you a more accurate information
 

01:21:05.700 --> 01:21:07.520
give you a more accurate information
about that we're just now beginning to

01:21:07.520 --> 01:21:07.530
about that we're just now beginning to
 

01:21:07.530 --> 01:21:09.260
about that we're just now beginning to
get information about the number of

01:21:09.260 --> 01:21:09.270
get information about the number of
 

01:21:09.270 --> 01:21:11.420
get information about the number of
articles published by a faculty per year

01:21:11.420 --> 01:21:11.430
articles published by a faculty per year
 

01:21:11.430 --> 01:21:15.020
articles published by a faculty per year
that's another story however how hard

01:21:15.020 --> 01:21:15.030
that's another story however how hard
 

01:21:15.030 --> 01:21:18.830
that's another story however how hard
it's been to get that information um let

01:21:18.830 --> 01:21:18.840
it's been to get that information um let
 

01:21:18.840 --> 01:21:20.620
it's been to get that information um let
me say another thing about about

01:21:20.620 --> 01:21:20.630
me say another thing about about
 

01:21:20.630 --> 01:21:24.470
me say another thing about about
managing that process I didn't talk

01:21:24.470 --> 01:21:24.480
managing that process I didn't talk
 

01:21:24.480 --> 01:21:26.930
managing that process I didn't talk
about caps but one of the thing that's

01:21:26.930 --> 01:21:26.940
about caps but one of the thing that's
 

01:21:26.940 --> 01:21:29.210
about caps but one of the thing that's
important to do is you don't want to by

01:21:29.210 --> 01:21:29.220
important to do is you don't want to by
 

01:21:29.220 --> 01:21:32.150
important to do is you don't want to by
instituting the compact so one of the

01:21:32.150 --> 01:21:32.160
instituting the compact so one of the
 

01:21:32.160 --> 01:21:33.380
instituting the compact so one of the
nice things about arguing for this way

01:21:33.380 --> 01:21:33.390
nice things about arguing for this way
 

01:21:33.390 --> 01:21:34.310
nice things about arguing for this way
look what a nice things about article

01:21:34.310 --> 01:21:34.320
look what a nice things about article
 

01:21:34.320 --> 01:21:37.040
look what a nice things about article
processing fees that faculty see is

01:21:37.040 --> 01:21:37.050
processing fees that faculty see is
 

01:21:37.050 --> 01:21:39.830
processing fees that faculty see is
suddenly the faculty are seeing an

01:21:39.830 --> 01:21:39.840
suddenly the faculty are seeing an
 

01:21:39.840 --> 01:21:41.780
suddenly the faculty are seeing an
economic signal where they never did

01:21:41.780 --> 01:21:41.790
economic signal where they never did
 

01:21:41.790 --> 01:21:44.990
economic signal where they never did

subscription the subscription fee model

01:21:47.180 --> 01:21:47.190
subscription the subscription fee model
 

01:21:47.190 --> 01:21:52.070
subscription the subscription fee model
is that the consumer of the product was

01:21:52.070 --> 01:21:52.080
is that the consumer of the product was
 

01:21:52.080 --> 01:21:53.450
is that the consumer of the product was
not the purchaser of the product the

01:21:53.450 --> 01:21:53.460
not the purchaser of the product the
 

01:21:53.460 --> 01:21:54.950
not the purchaser of the product the
purchaser of the product was the library

01:21:54.950 --> 01:21:54.960
purchaser of the product was the library
 

01:21:54.960 --> 01:21:56.450
purchaser of the product was the library
and the consumer was the faculty and the

01:21:56.450 --> 01:21:56.460
and the consumer was the faculty and the
 

01:21:56.460 --> 01:22:00.230
and the consumer was the faculty and the
students and when you have that disjunct

01:22:00.230 --> 01:22:00.240
students and when you have that disjunct
 

01:22:00.240 --> 01:22:02.950
students and when you have that disjunct
between the purchaser and the consumer

01:22:02.950 --> 01:22:02.960
between the purchaser and the consumer
 

01:22:02.960 --> 01:22:05.270
between the purchaser and the consumer
consumer doesn't see the price so they

01:22:05.270 --> 01:22:05.280
consumer doesn't see the price so they
 

01:22:05.280 --> 01:22:08.750
consumer doesn't see the price so they
want to over-consume so you get over

01:22:08.750 --> 01:22:08.760
want to over-consume so you get over
 

01:22:08.760 --> 01:22:11.180
want to over-consume so you get over
consumption in elasticity of demand so

01:22:11.180 --> 01:22:11.190
consumption in elasticity of demand so
 

01:22:11.190 --> 01:22:12.710
consumption in elasticity of demand so
which is exactly what leads to

01:22:12.710 --> 01:22:12.720
which is exactly what leads to
 

01:22:12.720 --> 01:22:15.920
which is exactly what leads to
hyperinflation so it's certain sense

01:22:15.920 --> 01:22:15.930
hyperinflation so it's certain sense
 

01:22:15.930 --> 01:22:17.390
hyperinflation so it's certain sense
predictable that that's what you end up

01:22:17.390 --> 01:22:17.400
predictable that that's what you end up
 

01:22:17.400 --> 01:22:20.240
predictable that that's what you end up
with it'd be great if the faculty member

01:22:20.240 --> 01:22:20.250
with it'd be great if the faculty member
 

01:22:20.250 --> 01:22:21.650
with it'd be great if the faculty member
could actually see a price signal here

01:22:21.650 --> 01:22:21.660
could actually see a price signal here
 

01:22:21.660 --> 01:22:23.780
could actually see a price signal here
and article processing fees have the

01:22:23.780 --> 01:22:23.790
and article processing fees have the
 

01:22:23.790 --> 01:22:25.640
and article processing fees have the
potential to do that but here look I've

01:22:25.640 --> 01:22:25.650
potential to do that but here look I've
 

01:22:25.650 --> 01:22:27.590
potential to do that but here look I've
just said we're going to take that price

01:22:27.590 --> 01:22:27.600
just said we're going to take that price
 

01:22:27.600 --> 01:22:29.960
just said we're going to take that price
signal off of the faculty members hands

01:22:29.960 --> 01:22:29.970
signal off of the faculty members hands
 

01:22:29.970 --> 01:22:32.570
signal off of the faculty members hands
so we're undoing one of the advantages

01:22:32.570 --> 01:22:32.580
so we're undoing one of the advantages
 

01:22:32.580 --> 01:22:34.040
so we're undoing one of the advantages
not the only advantage but one of the

01:22:34.040 --> 01:22:34.050
not the only advantage but one of the
 

01:22:34.050 --> 01:22:35.270
not the only advantage but one of the
advantages of

01:22:35.270 --> 01:22:35.280
advantages of
 

01:22:35.280 --> 01:22:38.689
advantages of
of that system well now we're getting

01:22:38.689 --> 01:22:38.699
of that system well now we're getting
 

01:22:38.699 --> 01:22:43.700
of that system well now we're getting
into details of implementation I think

01:22:43.700 --> 01:22:43.710
into details of implementation I think
 

01:22:43.710 --> 01:22:46.189
into details of implementation I think
the right way to handle this is to have

01:22:46.189 --> 01:22:46.199
the right way to handle this is to have
 

01:22:46.199 --> 01:22:49.819
the right way to handle this is to have
a cap per faculty member in dollars

01:22:49.819 --> 01:22:49.829
a cap per faculty member in dollars
 

01:22:49.829 --> 01:22:51.439
a cap per faculty member in dollars
because it's dollars that we want them

01:22:51.439 --> 01:22:51.449
because it's dollars that we want them
 

01:22:51.449 --> 01:22:54.290
because it's dollars that we want them
to optimize on the amount of

01:22:54.290 --> 01:22:54.300
to optimize on the amount of
 

01:22:54.300 --> 01:22:55.910
to optimize on the amount of
reimbursement of these fees that they

01:22:55.910 --> 01:22:55.920
reimbursement of these fees that they
 

01:22:55.920 --> 01:23:01.939
reimbursement of these fees that they
can receive so they're they're able to

01:23:01.939 --> 01:23:01.949
can receive so they're they're able to
 

01:23:01.949 --> 01:23:03.379
can receive so they're they're able to
get reimbursements for articles until

01:23:03.379 --> 01:23:03.389
get reimbursements for articles until
 

01:23:03.389 --> 01:23:04.819
get reimbursements for articles until
they've reached their cap for the year

01:23:04.819 --> 01:23:04.829
they've reached their cap for the year
 

01:23:04.829 --> 01:23:07.160
they've reached their cap for the year
so each year they'd have a cap on the

01:23:07.160 --> 01:23:07.170
so each year they'd have a cap on the
 

01:23:07.170 --> 01:23:09.200
so each year they'd have a cap on the
amount now and of course then you can

01:23:09.200 --> 01:23:09.210
amount now and of course then you can
 

01:23:09.210 --> 01:23:12.919
amount now and of course then you can
predict exactly an upper bound on what

01:23:12.919 --> 01:23:12.929
predict exactly an upper bound on what
 

01:23:12.929 --> 01:23:15.319
predict exactly an upper bound on what
it's going to cost you per year my guess

01:23:15.319 --> 01:23:15.329
it's going to cost you per year my guess
 

01:23:15.329 --> 01:23:17.660
it's going to cost you per year my guess
is that you'd never hit that upper bound

01:23:17.660 --> 01:23:17.670
is that you'd never hit that upper bound
 

01:23:17.670 --> 01:23:18.830
is that you'd never hit that upper bound
because some facts you're going to go

01:23:18.830 --> 01:23:18.840
because some facts you're going to go
 

01:23:18.840 --> 01:23:22.010
because some facts you're going to go
under so some some might hit the capital

01:23:22.010 --> 01:23:22.020
under so some some might hit the capital
 

01:23:22.020 --> 01:23:24.080
under so some some might hit the capital
you set the cap relatively high so I

01:23:24.080 --> 01:23:24.090
you set the cap relatively high so I
 

01:23:24.090 --> 01:23:26.779
you set the cap relatively high so I
might hit the cap most would go under so

01:23:26.779 --> 01:23:26.789
might hit the cap most would go under so
 

01:23:26.789 --> 01:23:27.740
might hit the cap most would go under so
you'd be paying less than that so you

01:23:27.740 --> 01:23:27.750
you'd be paying less than that so you
 

01:23:27.750 --> 01:23:28.549
you'd be paying less than that so you
still if you really want a good

01:23:28.549 --> 01:23:28.559
still if you really want a good
 

01:23:28.559 --> 01:23:29.689
still if you really want a good
prediction you'd still need to do some

01:23:29.689 --> 01:23:29.699
prediction you'd still need to do some
 

01:23:29.699 --> 01:23:33.229
prediction you'd still need to do some
kind of statistical that statistical

01:23:33.229 --> 01:23:33.239
kind of statistical that statistical
 

01:23:33.239 --> 01:23:36.830
kind of statistical that statistical
aggregate prediction but setting a

01:23:36.830 --> 01:23:36.840
aggregate prediction but setting a
 

01:23:36.840 --> 01:23:39.649
aggregate prediction but setting a
relatively high cap at least allows a

01:23:39.649 --> 01:23:39.659
relatively high cap at least allows a
 

01:23:39.659 --> 01:23:41.540
relatively high cap at least allows a
faculty member to trade-off dollars

01:23:41.540 --> 01:23:41.550
faculty member to trade-off dollars
 

01:23:41.550 --> 01:23:45.229

the way we would like them to do there
was a second part of the question I can

01:23:52.069 --> 01:23:52.079
was a second part of the question I can
 

01:23:52.079 --> 01:23:57.500
was a second part of the question I can
remember ah yes okay so there was a

01:23:57.500 --> 01:23:57.510
remember ah yes okay so there was a
 

01:23:57.510 --> 01:24:00.189
remember ah yes okay so there was a
study by Cornell where they tried to

01:24:00.189 --> 01:24:00.199
study by Cornell where they tried to
 

01:24:00.199 --> 01:24:03.260
study by Cornell where they tried to
predict what would happen if every

01:24:03.260 --> 01:24:03.270
predict what would happen if every
 

01:24:03.270 --> 01:24:06.140
predict what would happen if every
article incurred a $1,500 article

01:24:06.140 --> 01:24:06.150
article incurred a $1,500 article
 

01:24:06.150 --> 01:24:11.299
article incurred a $1,500 article
processing fee now what would happen to

01:24:11.299 --> 01:24:11.309
processing fee now what would happen to
 

01:24:11.309 --> 01:24:13.700
processing fee now what would happen to
the budget for the Cornell library the

01:24:13.700 --> 01:24:13.710
the budget for the Cornell library the
 

01:24:13.710 --> 01:24:14.720
the budget for the Cornell library the
library to pay all these article

01:24:14.720 --> 01:24:14.730
library to pay all these article
 

01:24:14.730 --> 01:24:16.069

processing fees in lieu of subscription

01:24:16.069 --> 01:24:16.079
processing fees in lieu of subscription
 

01:24:16.079 --> 01:24:17.479
processing fees in lieu of subscription
fees and it turned out that that was

01:24:17.479 --> 01:24:17.489
fees and it turned out that that was
 

01:24:17.489 --> 01:24:18.680
fees and it turned out that that was
more than they were paying in

01:24:18.680 --> 01:24:18.690
more than they were paying in
 

01:24:18.690 --> 01:24:23.000
more than they were paying in
subscription fees so the first point to

01:24:23.000 --> 01:24:23.010
subscription fees so the first point to
 

01:24:23.010 --> 01:24:26.450
subscription fees so the first point to
make is where did this $1,500 come from

01:24:26.450 --> 01:24:26.460
make is where did this $1,500 come from
 

01:24:26.460 --> 01:24:28.520
make is where did this $1,500 come from
not mount come from it turns out that

the extent open access journals is as it
 

01:24:37.860 --> 01:24:42.890
the extent open access journals is as it
turns out zero the mean is considerably

01:24:42.890 --> 01:24:42.900
turns out zero the mean is considerably
 

01:24:42.900 --> 01:24:45.350
turns out zero the mean is considerably
less than one thousand dollars so I

01:24:45.350 --> 01:24:45.360
less than one thousand dollars so I
 

01:24:45.360 --> 01:24:47.000
less than one thousand dollars so I
don't know where the $1,500 came came

01:24:47.000 --> 01:24:47.010
don't know where the $1,500 came came

any teeth so you're talking to there's
 

01:30:37.079 --> 01:30:40.939
any teeth so you're talking to there's
no teeth in the end what you need is to

lot of outreach and a lot of support for
 

01:30:57.629 --> 01:31:00.349
lot of outreach and a lot of support for
faculty and we don't know what's going

01:31:00.349 --> 01:31:00.359
faculty and we don't know what's going
 

01:31:00.359 --> 01:31:01.189
faculty and we don't know what's going
to work we're trying a bunch of

01:31:01.189 --> 01:31:01.199
to work we're trying a bunch of
 

01:31:01.199 --> 01:31:02.719
to work we're trying a bunch of
different things we're just getting

01:31:02.719 --> 01:31:02.729
different things we're just getting
 

01:31:02.729 --> 01:31:03.880
different things we're just getting
underway the office

01:31:03.880 --> 01:31:03.890
underway the office
 

01:31:03.890 --> 01:31:05.290
underway the office
so new that there's been no office to

01:31:05.290 --> 01:31:05.300
so new that there's been no office to
 

01:31:05.300 --> 01:31:08.440
so new that there's been no office to
even do this kind of stuff so really has

01:31:08.440 --> 01:31:08.450
even do this kind of stuff so really has
 

01:31:08.450 --> 01:31:18.310
even do this kind of stuff so really has
just begun this process of trying to get

01:31:18.310 --> 01:31:18.320
just begun this process of trying to get
 

01:31:18.320 --> 01:31:24.180
just begun this process of trying to get
faculty aware of what they need to do

01:31:24.180 --> 01:31:24.190
 
 

01:31:24.190 --> 01:31:27.610
 
helping them do it and so forth is just

01:31:27.610 --> 01:31:27.620
helping them do it and so forth is just
 

01:31:27.620 --> 01:31:29.350

what you know take care of that problem

01:32:22.220 --> 01:32:22.230
what you know take care of that problem
 

01:32:22.230 --> 01:32:24.780
what you know take care of that problem
that the university pay for all the

01:32:24.780 --> 01:32:24.790
that the university pay for all the
 

01:32:24.790 --> 01:32:26.930
that the university pay for all the
services that publishers provide but I

01:32:26.930 --> 01:32:26.940
services that publishers provide but I
 

01:32:26.940 --> 01:32:31.100

personally can't see how anybody would
 

01:32:31.110 --> 01:32:34.560
personally can't see how anybody would
or how the former model could work

01:32:34.560 --> 01:32:34.570
or how the former model could work
 

01:32:34.570 --> 01:32:37.140
or how the former model could work
because of the differential and ability

01:32:37.140 --> 01:32:37.150
because of the differential and ability
 

01:32:37.150 --> 01:32:38.550
because of the differential and ability
to pay of skywards I mean when I was a

01:32:38.550 --> 01:32:38.560

something published but I would have had

01:32:41.550 --> 01:32:41.560
something published but I would have had
 

01:32:41.560 --> 01:32:43.050
something published but I would have had
to think very carefully about it if I'd

01:32:43.050 --> 01:32:43.060
to think very carefully about it if I'd
 

01:32:43.060 --> 01:32:45.600
to think very carefully about it if I'd
had to pay really anything for it and it

01:32:45.600 --> 01:32:45.610
had to pay really anything for it and it
 

01:32:45.610 --> 01:32:46.620
had to pay really anything for it and it
may be tiered can you address that

01:32:46.620 --> 01:32:46.630
may be tiered can you address that
 

01:32:46.630 --> 01:32:48.360
may be tiered can you address that
question that's right I I think you're

01:32:48.360 --> 01:32:48.370
question that's right I I think you're
 

01:32:48.370 --> 01:32:52.320
question that's right I I think you're
absolutely right and so hey asking a

01:32:52.320 --> 01:32:52.330
absolutely right and so hey asking a
 

01:32:52.330 --> 01:32:56.430
absolutely right and so hey asking a
faculty member to pay an article

01:32:56.430 --> 01:32:56.440
faculty member to pay an article
 

01:32:56.440 --> 01:33:00.060
faculty member to pay an article
processing fee now we've already decided

01:33:00.060 --> 01:33:00.070
processing fee now we've already decided
 

01:33:00.070 --> 01:33:04.010

that the services the publishers provide

01:33:04.010 --> 01:33:04.020
that the services the publishers provide
 

01:33:04.020 --> 01:33:08.520
that the services the publishers provide
are important to the university and the

01:33:08.520 --> 01:33:08.530
are important to the university and the
 

01:33:08.530 --> 01:33:11.040
are important to the university and the
university should pay them now we

01:33:11.040 --> 01:33:11.050
university should pay them now we
 

01:33:11.050 --> 01:33:13.290
university should pay them now we
decided that under a model where we hid

01:33:13.290 --> 01:33:13.300
decided that under a model where we hid
 

01:33:13.300 --> 01:33:15.630
decided that under a model where we hid
those charges in subscription fees but

01:33:15.630 --> 01:33:15.640
those charges in subscription fees but
 

01:33:15.640 --> 01:33:17.700
those charges in subscription fees but
nothing's changed we still think it's

01:33:17.700 --> 01:33:17.710
nothing's changed we still think it's
 

01:33:17.710 --> 01:33:19.200
nothing's changed we still think it's
important to the University to pay them

01:33:19.200 --> 01:33:19.210
important to the University to pay them
 

01:33:19.210 --> 01:33:20.730
important to the University to pay them
and that's why I say the university

01:33:20.730 --> 01:33:20.740
and that's why I say the university
 

01:33:20.740 --> 01:33:23.220
and that's why I say the university
should put up or shot I mean the

01:33:23.220 --> 01:33:23.230
should put up or shot I mean the
 

01:33:23.230 --> 01:33:25.530
should put up or shot I mean the

they're also providing access through

01:37:59.310 --> 01:37:59.320
they're also providing access through
 

01:37:59.320 --> 01:38:04.980
they're also providing access through

relative costs to the publisher of those

relative costs to the publisher of those
two things is very different so

01:38:19.480 --> 01:38:19.490
two things is very different so
 

01:38:19.490 --> 01:38:22.080
two things is very different so
increasingly the cost for the latter is

01:38:22.080 --> 01:38:22.090
increasingly the cost for the latter is
 

01:38:22.090 --> 01:38:25.420
increasingly the cost for the latter is
getting smaller relative to the cost of

01:38:25.420 --> 01:38:25.430
getting smaller relative to the cost of
 

01:38:25.430 --> 01:38:28.510
getting smaller relative to the cost of
the former so it makes sense that the

01:38:28.510 --> 01:38:28.520
the former so it makes sense that the
 

01:38:28.520 --> 01:38:32.170
the former so it makes sense that the
revenue model should should switch that

01:38:32.170 --> 01:38:32.180
revenue model should should switch that
 

01:38:32.180 --> 01:38:36.040
revenue model should should switch that
way too so I don't think it's the case

01:38:36.040 --> 01:38:36.050
way too so I don't think it's the case
 

01:38:36.050 --> 01:38:38.050
way too so I don't think it's the case
that we're moving from the consumers of

the product to the producers of a lot of
 

01:38:40.610 --> 01:38:45.940
the product to the producers of a lot of
the product we're moving from the so the

the product we're moving from the so the
 

01:38:45.950 --> 01:38:47.410
the product we're moving from the so the

they're the ones that are receiving

they're the ones that are receiving
 

01:39:05.390 --> 01:39:07.450
they're the ones that are receiving
those benefits so we're just moving to a

01:39:07.450 --> 01:39:07.460
those benefits so we're just moving to a
 

01:39:07.460 --> 01:39:10.450
those benefits so we're just moving to a
model that matches those up better now

01:39:10.450 --> 01:39:10.460
model that matches those up better now
 

01:39:10.460 --> 01:39:12.070

the question is well maybe we should mix

01:39:12.070 --> 01:39:12.080
the question is well maybe we should mix
 

01:39:12.080 --> 01:39:14.110
the question is well maybe we should mix
it a little bit okay maybe the bulk of

01:39:14.110 --> 01:39:14.120
it a little bit okay maybe the bulk of
 

01:39:14.120 --> 01:39:15.490
it a little bit okay maybe the bulk of
it should be an article processing fee

01:39:15.490 --> 01:39:15.500
it should be an article processing fee
 

01:39:15.500 --> 01:39:18.040
it should be an article processing fee
but a little bit of it should be a

01:39:18.040 --> 01:39:18.050
but a little bit of it should be a

the problem is that there's a big

01:39:24.250 --> 01:39:24.260
the problem is that there's a big
 

01:39:24.260 --> 01:39:26.080
the problem is that there's a big
difference between charging zero for a

01:39:26.080 --> 01:39:26.090
difference between charging zero for a
 

01:39:26.090 --> 01:39:29.170
difference between charging zero for a
subscription fee and charging ten cents

01:39:29.170 --> 01:39:29.180
subscription fee and charging ten cents
 

01:39:29.180 --> 01:39:31.420
subscription fee and charging ten cents
for a subscription fee but just the

01:39:31.420 --> 01:39:31.430
for a subscription fee but just the
 

01:39:31.430 --> 01:39:33.850
for a subscription fee but just the
smallest increment puts you in a

smallest increment puts you in a
 

01:39:33.860 --> 01:39:38.100
smallest increment puts you in a
completely different situation and now

01:39:38.100 --> 01:39:38.110
completely different situation and now

marginal cost of online distribution is
essentially zero I really don't see

charging for that there are print copies

however and print copies have other

you no longer is access but it still has

you no longer is access but it still has

and it makes perfect sense to charge for

to be charging for their print copies
