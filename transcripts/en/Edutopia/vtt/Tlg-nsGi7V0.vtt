00:00:19.316 --> 00:00:21.926
&gt;&gt;Hi, I'm Tom Duenwald, I'm
principal of Sammamish High School.

00:00:22.466 --> 00:00:27.786
&gt;&gt;When I first came here
as principal Sammamish was

00:00:27.786 --> 00:00:29.626
in a place of declining enrollment.

00:00:29.986 --> 00:00:32.786
Things weren't working, the staff
came together and was thinking about,

00:00:32.786 --> 00:00:35.406
"Well, what could we do to take
Sammamish to the next level

00:00:35.406 --> 00:00:36.796
and really serve our students?"

00:00:36.876 --> 00:00:40.356
&gt;&gt;Adrienne: We have been fortunate to
get a federal grant that's allowed us

00:00:40.356 --> 00:00:43.906
to move forward with re-designing our
school to be a problem-based school,

00:00:43.936 --> 00:00:45.746
wall-to-wall, in every
curricular area.

00:00:45.746 --> 00:00:49.366
&gt;&gt;Tom: It's a significant
shift from what can be more

00:00:49.366 --> 00:00:51.986
of a traditional teacher-centered
classroom to more

00:00:51.986 --> 00:00:54.596
of a teacher-facilitated
learning process

00:00:54.706 --> 00:00:58.736
where we engage students
in authentic problems.

00:00:59.276 --> 00:01:02.086
High schools have been
very resistant to change.

00:01:02.086 --> 00:01:04.556
I mean I think a lot of
high schools, you visit them

00:01:04.556 --> 00:01:06.466
and it could be fifty years ago.

00:01:06.466 --> 00:01:07.976
And I don't think it
has to be that way.

00:01:18.046 --> 00:01:19.386
&gt;&gt;Adrienne: So in eight days the
school year is going to start

00:01:19.386 --> 00:01:21.656
and before that we are
getting together for five days

00:01:21.656 --> 00:01:23.296
of professional development led

00:01:23.296 --> 00:01:25.236
by Sammamish teachers
for Sammamish teachers.

00:01:25.976 --> 00:01:28.886
&gt;&gt;Teacher: How do I transform
my class from being driven by me

00:01:30.146 --> 00:01:31.816
to students wanting
to take ownership?

00:01:31.986 --> 00:01:36.216
&gt;&gt;Adrienne: PBL in a classroom is
students actively working together

00:01:36.216 --> 00:01:37.256
to solve a problem.

00:01:37.956 --> 00:01:39.806
The problem can be big or small.

00:01:39.866 --> 00:01:42.906
It can be the type of thing that
they can solve through discussion.

00:01:42.906 --> 00:01:45.346
It can be the type of thing that
they build a product around.

00:01:45.786 --> 00:01:49.146
But, ultimately, it's students
trying to learn content

00:01:49.236 --> 00:01:50.816
through the solution to this problem.

00:01:50.816 --> 00:01:54.916
&gt;&gt;There is something to
students having the opportunity

00:01:55.216 --> 00:01:59.456
to get together and deal
with real-world challenges

00:01:59.666 --> 00:02:04.076
that makes them hungry for the next
challenge, that desire to come back

00:02:04.146 --> 00:02:06.986
to the table and invest more
of themselves in the outcome.

00:02:07.216 --> 00:02:10.596
We want to grow that feeling in them
over the course of these four years.

00:02:10.826 --> 00:02:12.426
That's what gets them to
stay involved in education.

00:02:12.646 --> 00:02:15.386
&gt;&gt;Jayesh: This idea that
the whole school is focused

00:02:15.466 --> 00:02:17.536
on problem-based learning
is really powerful.

00:02:18.266 --> 00:02:22.016
Fifteen years of teaching
here, I've seen quite a lot.

00:02:22.646 --> 00:02:24.086
I'm good at what I do.

00:02:24.556 --> 00:02:29.426
I would like to be better, I would
like to be a more effective teacher.

00:02:30.216 --> 00:02:32.626
&gt;&gt;Adrienne: For an entire
school to go through this

00:02:32.626 --> 00:02:34.766
across the board is a big, big change

00:02:34.816 --> 00:02:37.856
in what we're seeing other
schools doing across the country.

00:02:38.046 --> 00:02:43.766
&gt;&gt;Rob: Sammamish has always been on
the verge, we're a really good school

00:02:43.926 --> 00:02:47.996
and we're on the verge, I think,
of always becoming a great school.

00:02:47.996 --> 00:02:49.896
If there's something that's
gonna transform our school,

00:02:50.176 --> 00:02:51.466
this is what it's going to be.

00:03:06.056 --> 00:03:07.826
&gt;&gt;Adrienne: I want to congratulate
you guys for being on time.

00:03:07.826 --> 00:03:08.766
Hold on, hold on, hold on.

00:03:09.056 --> 00:03:09.996
Slow down, slow down.

00:03:09.996 --> 00:03:12.706
&gt;&gt;The first day of school we're
gonna have a brand new crop

00:03:12.706 --> 00:03:15.366
of freshmen coming into
some brand new classes

00:03:15.366 --> 00:03:16.336
that we've never taught before.

00:03:16.376 --> 00:03:20.006
We're hoping that we're gonna be
able to get them engaged early on

00:03:20.006 --> 00:03:24.566
and help them see the benefits and
positives of problem-based learning,

00:03:24.566 --> 00:03:25.676
but I'm anxious about it.

00:03:25.906 --> 00:03:27.816
&gt;&gt;Rob: So I have to tell you-

00:03:27.816 --> 00:03:30.126
we've got five teachers
teaching this class.

00:03:31.146 --> 00:03:33.266
We've been working on it this summer.

00:03:33.266 --> 00:03:34.856
So we're really looking
forward to it.

00:03:35.146 --> 00:03:36.976
Your feedback is gonna
be important to us.

00:03:57.046 --> 00:03:58.856
&gt;&gt;Jayesh: The problem has
to be authentic in the sense

00:03:58.856 --> 00:04:00.456
that it has a resonance
with the students.

00:04:00.836 --> 00:04:05.156
&gt;&gt;Student: One of the problems in the
ocean is that with the higher amount

00:04:05.156 --> 00:04:09.386
of CO2, calcifying
organisms are decreasing.

00:04:09.446 --> 00:04:11.956
We're testing to see how well life--

00:04:12.546 --> 00:04:17.556
other life in the ocean lives
without calcifying organisms.

00:04:17.556 --> 00:04:20.046
&gt;&gt;Alejandra: I found out that
corral reefs are being destroyed

00:04:20.046 --> 00:04:20.316
with high CO2.

00:04:20.416 --> 00:04:22.786
It moved me and I'd
like to change that.

00:04:22.876 --> 00:04:27.306
&gt;&gt;Teacher: Does your gravel
ever get green and slimy?

00:04:27.306 --> 00:04:28.426
&gt;&gt;Anna: Oh, yeah, Algae.

00:04:28.536 --> 00:04:32.566
&gt;&gt;Anna: Especially in
science and math I feel

00:04:32.566 --> 00:04:36.306
like the subject can get
a little bit overwhelming.

00:04:36.306 --> 00:04:39.376
So that's why I like the
project: it's one step at a time.

00:04:39.376 --> 00:04:42.266
&gt;&gt;Jainxin: At first I thought
project-based learning was a plan

00:04:42.266 --> 00:04:46.616
by the government to
increase the class sizes

00:04:46.616 --> 00:04:50.826
so one teacher could teach more
students, but after I worked

00:04:50.826 --> 00:04:55.086
with it I realized it was a way for
students to connect to the material

00:04:55.086 --> 00:04:56.976
and understand the
material in our own way.

00:05:17.106 --> 00:05:19.906
&gt;&gt;Student: Okay, migration
patterns from rural

00:05:19.906 --> 00:05:23.466
to urban: we know that one.

00:05:23.466 --> 00:05:26.966
All right, rural is, like,
farming, agriculture, right?

00:05:27.226 --> 00:05:29.256
And then urban's kind of,
like, where we live right now.

00:05:29.296 --> 00:05:31.396
So you can, like, draw a
picture from someone, like,

00:05:31.396 --> 00:05:35.706
in eastern Washington
moving over to Bellevue.

00:05:35.706 --> 00:05:39.686
&gt;&gt;Karissa: At first I thought that
it might not be possible to try

00:05:39.686 --> 00:05:41.186
to get all the content in.

00:05:41.436 --> 00:05:45.106
But I've found that we can still
find that balance where maybe one

00:05:45.106 --> 00:05:48.426
or two days out of an entire unit
I can kind of really lead them

00:05:48.426 --> 00:05:51.406
down the content and
then they can take that

00:05:51.406 --> 00:05:53.396
and better learn from one another.

00:05:53.396 --> 00:05:54.666
&gt;&gt;Danielle: I get moderate grades.

00:05:55.266 --> 00:05:57.166
But if it's, like, you
have a group project,

00:05:57.466 --> 00:06:00.066
you're gonna have other people
who have other ideas besides you.

00:06:00.066 --> 00:06:02.626
So you're gonna be, like,
understanding it better

00:06:02.626 --> 00:06:04.156
than just reading something
by yourself.

00:06:04.426 --> 00:06:06.996
&gt;&gt;Rosendo: Yeah, I have a lot of
friends who struggle with English,

00:06:07.556 --> 00:06:08.806
because they either
just came in, like,

00:06:08.806 --> 00:06:10.456
two years ago or just barely came.

00:06:10.646 --> 00:06:14.046
So, like, if they're in a
classroom with a lot of lecturing,

00:06:14.226 --> 00:06:16.816
not enough group time, they're
not gonna learn English.

00:06:21.336 --> 00:06:23.276
&gt;&gt;Adrienne: One of the ways

00:06:23.276 --> 00:06:26.186
that we're empowering teachers is
we're giving them time during the

00:06:26.186 --> 00:06:28.716
school day to work with their
colleagues on curriculum

00:06:28.716 --> 00:06:31.156
that make sense to them,
given what they understand

00:06:31.156 --> 00:06:33.136
about the best practices of
teaching in their discipline.

00:06:33.246 --> 00:06:35.546
We're saying, "Come out
of that locked classroom.

00:06:35.756 --> 00:06:38.316
Come into community and
let's find a way that we,

00:06:38.316 --> 00:06:39.546
together, can move forward."

00:06:44.896 --> 00:06:49.356
&gt;&gt;David: Our project was to
create a aquaponics system

00:06:49.416 --> 00:06:50.966
and we had several
people working on it.

00:06:50.966 --> 00:06:52.606
In my case I was kind
of the team leader.

00:06:52.996 --> 00:06:57.626
We had to learn how an environmental
system in the wild would work

00:06:57.626 --> 00:07:01.166
and then simulate that with the
materials that we were given.

00:07:01.666 --> 00:07:05.326
The whole creative process
kind of went in steps.

00:07:05.386 --> 00:07:07.486
Two members of my group
who are kind of just, like,

00:07:07.486 --> 00:07:10.236
the thinkers that would think,
"What if we could include this?"

00:07:10.316 --> 00:07:12.266
Once those two came
up with the ideas,

00:07:12.406 --> 00:07:16.236
it would go through another person
who was kind of like the designer

00:07:16.236 --> 00:07:17.736
to figure out, "Oh,
how would we make it?"

00:07:17.736 --> 00:07:21.116
And then it would kind of
go up to me and I would kind

00:07:21.306 --> 00:07:22.876
of be like the final decider.

00:07:23.086 --> 00:07:26.896
&gt;&gt;Jainxin: I think it's a great
thing that students have a choice.

00:07:27.176 --> 00:07:32.236
So when we do project-based
learning we're allowed

00:07:32.236 --> 00:07:36.976
to teach ourselves the material
in a way that we can understand.

00:07:52.076 --> 00:07:54.806
&gt;&gt;Rob: Well, the current project is
called "The Scramble for the Arctic"

00:07:55.746 --> 00:08:00.856
and as a result of the climate
change the arctic is getting smaller

00:08:01.066 --> 00:08:05.386
and there's all sorts of resources
in the arctic that will be available.

00:08:05.546 --> 00:08:07.386
And the question we've
posed to students is,

00:08:07.386 --> 00:08:08.976
"Who should control these resources?"

00:08:11.056 --> 00:08:13.916
&gt;&gt;Student: We're arguing
about the Northwest Passage.

00:08:13.916 --> 00:08:14.056
&gt;&gt;Christine: I know.

00:08:14.266 --> 00:08:15.086
We need that, too.

00:08:15.086 --> 00:08:18.596
This would probably be faster
than the actual Panama Canal.

00:08:18.596 --> 00:08:20.766
&gt;&gt;It helps you prepare
for the future.

00:08:20.766 --> 00:08:22.276
It gives you, like, leadership

00:08:22.276 --> 00:08:26.216
and really good cooperation
skills with your group members.

00:08:26.306 --> 00:08:29.626
&gt;&gt;Kyra: I think it's
more interesting.

00:08:29.906 --> 00:08:32.806
I don't like just reading
and having a test.

00:08:32.896 --> 00:08:39.356
It's not fun and you remember it
for the test and then you forget it.

00:08:41.016 --> 00:08:43.626
&gt;&gt;Kelsey: We had someone come
in, an actual client come in,

00:08:43.626 --> 00:08:45.606
and choose which one
she liked the best.

00:08:47.296 --> 00:08:51.496
&gt;&gt;Client: I appreciated how
thoughtfully you responded to sort

00:08:51.536 --> 00:08:53.646
of the "client's needs," my needs.

00:08:54.236 --> 00:08:55.266
&gt;&gt;Anna: It's not just
for your teacher

00:08:55.266 --> 00:08:56.466
who sees your work all the time;

00:08:56.466 --> 00:08:59.486
it's for a client who's
deciding whether to build it.

00:08:59.646 --> 00:09:02.136
And so you really strive to do well.

00:09:02.136 --> 00:09:05.556
&gt;&gt;Tom Duenwald: When the students
know that what they're doing

00:09:05.556 --> 00:09:08.196
in the classroom has an
audience outside the classroom,

00:09:08.196 --> 00:09:11.456
it really helps them
deepen their thinking on it.

00:09:11.666 --> 00:09:13.866
And I think that is
pretty authentic in terms

00:09:13.866 --> 00:09:15.946
of what the future work world holds.

00:09:16.036 --> 00:09:19.286
&gt;&gt;Kelsey: I wasn't realizing how much
I was learning until the end of it.

00:09:19.616 --> 00:09:23.116
I'm a better learner when
I can actually get my hands

00:09:23.116 --> 00:09:23.946
on something and do it.

00:09:23.946 --> 00:09:25.326
And I'll just remember it better,

00:09:25.326 --> 00:09:26.966
because I'll have an
experience to attach it with.

00:09:39.046 --> 00:09:41.926
&gt;&gt;Christine: We're preparing for,
like, a U.N. summit, just, like,

00:09:41.926 --> 00:09:44.416
portraying it and how they
actually do it in real life.

00:09:44.526 --> 00:09:46.766
&gt;&gt;Rob: So you should say, "Can
I have these folks come up

00:09:46.766 --> 00:09:49.776
and then we're gonna
got to Al Jazeera--

00:09:49.776 --> 00:09:52.026
Al Jazeera our first
live media link."

00:09:52.826 --> 00:09:56.126
&gt;&gt;Rob: These are hearings about
who should control the arctic,

00:09:56.356 --> 00:09:59.836
and what should we do when
this territory opens up?

00:10:00.156 --> 00:10:04.506
They're playing the role of
countries, and indigenous people,

00:10:04.946 --> 00:10:07.936
environmental groups,
multinational organizations.

00:10:08.056 --> 00:10:10.966
This is a real-life
problem that's playing out.

00:10:11.236 --> 00:10:13.976
&gt;&gt;Student: Not only is oil
drilling-- it's extremely dangerous,

00:10:13.976 --> 00:10:16.376
but oil recovery is
nearly impossible in ice.

00:10:16.966 --> 00:10:21.406
And this oil will not last for more
than three years according to studies

00:10:21.406 --> 00:10:23.216
in the U.S. Geological Survey.

00:10:23.356 --> 00:10:24.806
It's about standing up for
environment and families

00:10:24.836 --> 00:10:25.976
and our future, and I
won't give up this fight.

00:10:26.636 --> 00:10:30.976
&gt;&gt;Student: Thank you, Delegate.

00:10:31.046 --> 00:10:34.016
&gt;&gt;Bruna: Do you understand that
if I could have a trade route

00:10:34.156 --> 00:10:35.536
through the arctic, my shipping

00:10:35.536 --> 00:10:38.566
to the US would be
cut two weeks shorter.

00:10:38.566 --> 00:10:43.956
So I'm sorry, I will
not be supporting you.

00:10:44.216 --> 00:10:47.016
&gt;&gt;Bruna: I was the U.N. ambassador
to China, so I was a big leader

00:10:47.016 --> 00:10:48.676
and I was totally into it.

00:10:48.676 --> 00:10:50.616
I feel like if this was to happen

00:10:50.616 --> 00:10:52.416
in real life I could
potentially change the world.

00:10:52.416 --> 00:10:54.756
And that's the kind of
stuff I really like doing.

00:10:55.046 --> 00:10:58.706
&gt;&gt;Student: Even if there is a chance
that what happened in the Gulf Coast,

00:10:58.706 --> 00:11:02.206
even if it wasn't by you guys or what
happened in Alaska from you guys,

00:11:02.496 --> 00:11:04.596
could happen in the arctic,
it could be devastating.

00:11:04.596 --> 00:11:08.236
&gt;&gt;Student: If everybody just
suddenly decided to drop oil,

00:11:08.306 --> 00:11:11.236
regular people do not, like,
my parents and your parents--

00:11:11.266 --> 00:11:12.976
do not have the means to just
stop and go buy an electric car.

00:11:13.366 --> 00:11:16.706
&gt;&gt;Natasha: Everyone's really, like,
pumped up and excited for it and,

00:11:16.896 --> 00:11:20.306
like, there's a lot of tension
also, because people are agreeing,

00:11:20.736 --> 00:11:24.976
disagreeing, but I think
that's what's making it fun.

00:11:25.046 --> 00:11:26.566
&gt;&gt;Student: ..to protect Oceania
we have the World Wildlife Fund.

00:11:26.566 --> 00:11:31.616
We understand that you want to
protect the natural environment

00:11:31.616 --> 00:11:33.476
of the arctic, both nature
and wildlife in the area.

00:11:33.506 --> 00:11:34.976
However, we do intend despite
your beliefs to go forward.

00:11:35.056 --> 00:11:35.766
&gt;&gt;Rob: That was great.

00:11:35.766 --> 00:11:37.916
Really-- I'm really proud of you.

00:11:44.076 --> 00:11:46.596
&gt;&gt;Rob: What we do in
PBL, it builds on itself,

00:11:46.786 --> 00:11:49.276
so that these projects
become part of the culture

00:11:49.446 --> 00:11:52.026
and traditions of the school.

00:11:52.446 --> 00:11:55.686
We have a day where we look at the
presentations of other students.

00:11:56.156 --> 00:12:00.246
We have a day where we're going to
debate what happens in the arctic.

00:12:01.606 --> 00:12:03.466
The biochem folks, they
grow their own food.

00:12:03.876 --> 00:12:06.986
And I know they as a class
have some kind of feast.

00:12:07.116 --> 00:12:07.606
That's great.

00:12:07.606 --> 00:12:11.086
&gt;&gt;Teacher: If you want some
of the tilapia that we raised,

00:12:11.086 --> 00:12:12.836
get a little plate
and come over here.

00:12:13.206 --> 00:12:18.296
&gt;&gt;Rob: What that culture says to
students is that what you bring

00:12:19.306 --> 00:12:20.646
to the table is valuable.

00:12:20.896 --> 00:12:24.946
&gt;&gt;Adrienne: As teenagers I
think often what they fight

00:12:24.946 --> 00:12:27.566
against is a sense that
life is happening to them.

00:12:27.566 --> 00:12:30.186
So we give them classrooms
where they help

00:12:30.186 --> 00:12:32.256
to direct what's happening there.

00:12:32.966 --> 00:12:34.946
They are important to this process.

00:12:34.946 --> 00:12:36.466
This is not a place
that you can hide.

00:12:36.686 --> 00:12:41.256
This is a place where we want the
best of you, we see the best in you,

00:12:41.256 --> 00:12:42.956
now let's bring that out.
