00:00:00.590 --> 00:00:02.050
- [Voiceover] Let's talk a little bit

00:00:02.050 --> 00:00:04.690
about chemical reactions.

00:00:04.690 --> 00:00:07.720
And chemical reactions
are a very big deal.

00:00:07.720 --> 00:00:11.520
Without chemical reactions,
you or I would not exist.

00:00:11.520 --> 00:00:14.650
In your body right now,
there are countless

00:00:14.650 --> 00:00:17.250
chemical reactions going on every second.

00:00:17.250 --> 00:00:20.080
Without chemical reactions,
we would have no life,

00:00:20.080 --> 00:00:23.220
we would not even have the
universe as we know it.

00:00:23.220 --> 00:00:25.420
So what are chemical reactions.

00:00:25.420 --> 00:00:28.790
Well, they're any time that
you have bonds being formed

00:00:28.790 --> 00:00:31.420
or broken between atoms or molecules.

00:00:31.420 --> 00:00:34.320
So what are we talking about there?

00:00:34.320 --> 00:00:36.590
Well this is maybe one of the most

00:00:36.590 --> 00:00:38.190
fundamental chemical reactions.

00:00:38.190 --> 00:00:40.220
Once again if one never
occurred, we'd be in trouble,

00:00:40.220 --> 00:00:43.010
we would not have, we
would not have any water.

00:00:43.010 --> 00:00:45.620
But let's think about what
it is actually describing.

00:00:45.620 --> 00:00:49.220
So over here on the left-hand
side we have the reactants.

00:00:49.220 --> 00:00:50.990
Let me write that down.

00:00:50.990 --> 00:00:53.490
So here we have the reactants.

00:00:53.490 --> 00:00:56.750
These are the molecules
that are going to react.

00:00:56.750 --> 00:01:00.550
And then we have an arrow
that moves us to the product.

00:01:00.550 --> 00:01:02.290
So let me do that in a different color.

00:01:02.290 --> 00:01:05.620
So we have an arrow that
moves us to the product,

00:01:05.620 --> 00:01:07.820
or we could say the products.

00:01:07.820 --> 00:01:09.920
And so what are the reactants here?

00:01:09.920 --> 00:01:12.250
Well we have molecular hydrogen

00:01:12.250 --> 00:01:14.250
and we have molecular oxygen.

00:01:14.250 --> 00:01:16.310
Now why did I say molecular hydrogen?

00:01:16.310 --> 00:01:18.290
Because molecular hydrogen,
which is the state

00:01:18.290 --> 00:01:20.190
that you would typically find hydrogen in

00:01:20.190 --> 00:01:22.120
if you just have it by itself,

00:01:22.120 --> 00:01:24.820
it is actually made up
of two hydrogen atoms.

00:01:24.820 --> 00:01:28.250
You see it right over here,
one, two hydrogen atoms.

00:01:28.250 --> 00:01:30.990
And what we have in order
to have this reaction,

00:01:30.990 --> 00:01:33.690
you don't just need one
molecular hydrogen and one,

00:01:33.690 --> 00:01:36.990
or one molecule of hydrogen
and one molecule of oxygen.

00:01:36.990 --> 00:01:39.720
For every, for this reaction to happen,

00:01:39.720 --> 00:01:43.650
you actually have two molecules
of molecular hydrogen.

00:01:43.650 --> 00:01:46.050
So this is actually made
up of four hydrogen atoms.

00:01:46.050 --> 00:01:47.490
So let me make this clear.

00:01:47.490 --> 00:01:49.610
So this right over here,

00:01:49.610 --> 00:01:52.950
this is two molecules
of molecular hydrogen.

00:01:52.950 --> 00:01:54.350
And that's why we have the two

00:01:54.350 --> 00:01:57.120
right out front of the H sub-two.

00:01:57.120 --> 00:02:00.180
This little subscript
two tells us there's two

00:02:00.180 --> 00:02:02.690
of the hydrogen atoms in this molecule.

00:02:02.690 --> 00:02:04.650
And then this big, this big white two

00:02:04.650 --> 00:02:06.490
that we have right over here,
that tells us that we're

00:02:06.490 --> 00:02:08.220
dealing with two of those molecules

00:02:08.220 --> 00:02:09.880
for this reaction to
happen, that we need two

00:02:09.880 --> 00:02:12.520
of these molecules for every,

00:02:12.520 --> 00:02:14.990
for every molecule of molecular oxygen.

00:02:14.990 --> 00:02:16.790
And molecular oxygen, once again,

00:02:16.790 --> 00:02:19.720
this is composed of two oxygen atoms.

00:02:19.720 --> 00:02:21.180
One, two.

00:02:21.180 --> 00:02:23.390
So under the right conditions,
so you need a little bit

00:02:23.390 --> 00:02:25.590
of energy to make this happen.

00:02:25.590 --> 00:02:26.790
If under the right conditions these

00:02:26.790 --> 00:02:27.920
two things are going to react.

00:02:27.920 --> 00:02:29.880
And actually it's very, very reactive,

00:02:29.880 --> 00:02:31.520
molecular hydrogen and molecular oxygen.

00:02:31.520 --> 00:02:34.250
So much so that it's actually
used for rocket fuel.

00:02:34.250 --> 00:02:38.350
You are going to produce
two molecules of water.

00:02:38.350 --> 00:02:40.420
We see that right over here.

00:02:40.420 --> 00:02:43.820
And look, I did not create
or destroy any atoms.

00:02:43.820 --> 00:02:47.550
I had one, I had one,

00:02:47.550 --> 00:02:49.990
I had one oxygen atom here.

00:02:49.990 --> 00:02:53.110
It was part of the oxygen
molecule right here,

00:02:53.110 --> 00:02:55.460
then I have the second
one right over here now.

00:02:55.460 --> 00:02:57.750
Now they are part of separate molecules.

00:02:57.750 --> 00:03:00.050
I had, I had a,

00:03:00.050 --> 00:03:02.250
I had one two, three, four hydrogens.

00:03:02.250 --> 00:03:05.920
I now have one, two, three,

00:03:05.920 --> 00:03:08.620
four hydrogens, just like that.

00:03:08.620 --> 00:03:09.950
And actually this produces a...

00:03:09.950 --> 00:03:11.920
So we could say some energy,

00:03:11.920 --> 00:03:14.250
and I'm being inexact right over here.

00:03:14.250 --> 00:03:18.290
Some energy and then we
could say a lot of energy.

00:03:18.290 --> 00:03:20.520
A lot of energy.

00:03:20.520 --> 00:03:22.690
So this is a reaction that
you just give it a little bit

00:03:22.690 --> 00:03:25.650
of a kick-start and it
really wants to happen.

00:03:25.650 --> 00:03:29.590
A lot, a lot of energy.

00:03:29.590 --> 00:03:31.290
So one thing that you might wonder,

00:03:31.290 --> 00:03:32.920
and this is something
that I first wondered

00:03:32.920 --> 00:03:34.050
when I learned about reactions,

00:03:34.050 --> 00:03:36.180
well how do, how does this happen?

00:03:36.180 --> 00:03:38.590
You know, is this a very organized thing?

00:03:38.590 --> 00:03:40.920
You know, do these molecules somehow

00:03:40.920 --> 00:03:42.780
know to react with each other?

00:03:42.780 --> 00:03:44.450
And the answer's no.

00:03:44.450 --> 00:03:47.590
Chemistry is a incredibly messy thing.

00:03:47.590 --> 00:03:50.850
You have these things bouncing
around, they have energy.

00:03:50.850 --> 00:03:52.220
They're bouncing around all over the place

00:03:52.220 --> 00:03:53.850
and actually when you provide energy,

00:03:53.850 --> 00:03:56.010
they're gonna bounce around
even more rigorously,

00:03:56.010 --> 00:03:59.890
enough so that they
collide in the right ways

00:03:59.890 --> 00:04:02.182
so that they break their old bonds

00:04:02.182 --> 00:04:04.020
and then they form these new bonds.

00:04:04.020 --> 00:04:06.850
So whenever you see these
reactions in biology

00:04:06.850 --> 00:04:08.290
or chemistry class, keep that in mind.

00:04:08.290 --> 00:04:11.820
It looks all neat and
organized but in a real system,

00:04:11.820 --> 00:04:13.550
these are all of these things just

00:04:13.550 --> 00:04:15.520
bouncing around in all
different crazy ways.

00:04:15.520 --> 00:04:17.220
And that's why energy's
an important thing here.

00:04:17.220 --> 00:04:19.320
Because the more energy
you apply to the system,

00:04:19.320 --> 00:04:21.180
the more that they're
going to bounce around,

00:04:21.180 --> 00:04:23.120
the more that they're going
to interact with each other.

00:04:23.120 --> 00:04:25.850
The more reactants you put in,

00:04:25.850 --> 00:04:27.920
the more chance they're
going to bounce around

00:04:27.920 --> 00:04:30.750
and be able to react with each other.

00:04:30.750 --> 00:04:32.050
Now I'm gonna introduce another word

00:04:32.050 --> 00:04:33.890
that you're gonna see in chemistry a lot.

00:04:33.890 --> 00:04:36.250
This water, these two...

00:04:36.250 --> 00:04:39.890
We see we have two water molecules here.

00:04:39.890 --> 00:04:42.590
We could call them molecules,
but since they are actually

00:04:42.590 --> 00:04:45.420
made up of two or more different elements,

00:04:45.420 --> 00:04:48.220
we could also call this a compound.

00:04:48.220 --> 00:04:52.050
So water, water is, you
could call it a molecule,

00:04:52.050 --> 00:04:54.220
or you could call it a compound.

00:04:54.220 --> 00:04:56.250
So this is a molecule or compound,

00:04:56.250 --> 00:04:57.690
while this molecular hydrogen,

00:04:57.690 --> 00:04:59.650
you would not call this a compound.

00:04:59.650 --> 00:05:01.950
And this molecular oxygen,
of course it's a molecule,

00:05:01.950 --> 00:05:05.290
but you would not call
it a compound either.

00:05:05.290 --> 00:05:07.190
And just to get an appreciation

00:05:07.190 --> 00:05:08.990
of how much energy this produces,

00:05:08.990 --> 00:05:11.120
let me just show you this
picture right over here.

00:05:11.120 --> 00:05:12.920
That's the space shuttle and this,

00:05:12.920 --> 00:05:15.820
this big tank right over here, let me...

00:05:15.820 --> 00:05:18.640
This big tank contains a bunch

00:05:18.640 --> 00:05:20.950
of liquid oxygen and hydrogen.

00:05:20.950 --> 00:05:25.190
And to create this
incredible amount of energy,

00:05:25.190 --> 00:05:26.420
it actually just...

00:05:26.420 --> 00:05:29.650
You mix the two together
with a little bit of energy

00:05:29.650 --> 00:05:31.520
and then you produce a ton of energy

00:05:31.520 --> 00:05:34.520
that makes the rocket, that
makes the space shuttle.

00:05:34.520 --> 00:05:36.210
Well, space shuttle's
been discontinued now,

00:05:36.210 --> 00:05:39.550
but back when they did it, to make it

00:05:39.550 --> 00:05:44.350
get it's necessary,
it's necessary velocity.

00:05:44.350 --> 00:05:45.750
Now let's talk about the idea.

00:05:45.750 --> 00:05:48.910
So, you know, this reaction,
strongly goes in this,

00:05:48.910 --> 00:05:51.380
in the direction of going to water.

00:05:51.380 --> 00:05:53.420
But it can actually go the other way,

00:05:53.420 --> 00:05:55.720
but it's very, very hard
for it to go the other way.

00:05:55.720 --> 00:05:57.020
So in general we would consider

00:05:57.020 --> 00:06:00.750
this to be an irreversible
reaction, even though it is.

00:06:00.750 --> 00:06:02.120
You know irreversible sounds like,

00:06:02.120 --> 00:06:03.620
hey you can't go the other way.

00:06:03.620 --> 00:06:05.120
It just really means that it's very

00:06:05.120 --> 00:06:06.220
unlikely to go the other way.

00:06:06.220 --> 00:06:08.550
You have to supply a lot of
energy to go the other way.

00:06:08.550 --> 00:06:10.650
To make this reaction go the other way,

00:06:10.650 --> 00:06:12.690
you would have to do
something called electrolysis,

00:06:12.690 --> 00:06:14.520
you provide energy, etcetera, etcetera.

00:06:14.520 --> 00:06:16.620
But in general, the way
that this is written,

00:06:16.620 --> 00:06:18.690
because the arrow is only
pointing in one direction,

00:06:18.690 --> 00:06:21.750
this is implying that it is irreversible.

00:06:21.750 --> 00:06:24.490
Irreversible.

00:06:24.490 --> 00:06:25.820
Irreversible.

00:06:25.820 --> 00:06:26.920
Which probably makes you think,

00:06:26.920 --> 00:06:29.390
well what about reversible reactions?

00:06:29.390 --> 00:06:31.850
And I have an example

00:06:31.850 --> 00:06:36.320
of a reversible reaction, right over here.

00:06:36.320 --> 00:06:40.880
I have a one bicarbonate ion.

00:06:40.880 --> 00:06:44.150
And the word ion, that's
just used to describe

00:06:44.150 --> 00:06:47.490
any molecule or atom that has either,

00:06:47.490 --> 00:06:49.620
has an imbalance of electrons or protons

00:06:49.620 --> 00:06:52.250
that cause it to have a net charge.

00:06:52.250 --> 00:06:55.320
So this makes this an ion,
and actually right over here,

00:06:55.320 --> 00:06:58.850
this is a hydrogen, this is a
hydrogen ion right over here.

00:06:58.850 --> 00:07:00.550
Both of these are charged.

00:07:00.550 --> 00:07:03.820
One has a positive charge,
one has a negative charge.

00:07:03.820 --> 00:07:07.050
But they are both, they are both ions.

00:07:07.050 --> 00:07:08.320
And this reactions right over here,

00:07:08.320 --> 00:07:11.420
you have the bicarbonate ion
that looks something like this.

00:07:11.420 --> 00:07:14.020
This is just my hand-drawing of it.

00:07:14.020 --> 00:07:16.880
Reacting with a hydrogen ion,
it's really a hydrogen atom

00:07:16.880 --> 00:07:19.320
that has lost it's electron,
so some people would even say

00:07:19.320 --> 00:07:22.220
this is a proton right over here.

00:07:22.220 --> 00:07:24.120
This is an equilibrium reaction,

00:07:24.120 --> 00:07:26.050
where it can form carbonic acid.

00:07:26.050 --> 00:07:28.120
And notice all that's
happening is this hydrogen

00:07:28.120 --> 00:07:31.880
is attaching to one of
the oxygens over here.

00:07:31.880 --> 00:07:34.790
And this is an equilibrium
because if in an actual,

00:07:34.790 --> 00:07:37.920
in an actual solution,
it's going back and forth.

00:07:37.920 --> 00:07:39.850
If you actually provide more reactants,

00:07:39.850 --> 00:07:41.450
you're gonna go more in that direction.

00:07:41.450 --> 00:07:43.920
If you provide more of
the products over here,

00:07:43.920 --> 00:07:47.090
then you're gonna go in that direction.

00:07:47.090 --> 00:07:50.450
And so in an actual, in
an actual environment,

00:07:50.450 --> 00:07:53.050
in an actual system, it's constantly going

00:07:53.050 --> 00:07:55.350
back and forth between these two things.

00:07:55.350 --> 00:07:57.090
And different reversible reactions might

00:07:57.090 --> 00:07:58.920
tend to one side or the other.

00:07:58.920 --> 00:08:01.450
If you provide more of
the stuff on one side,

00:08:01.450 --> 00:08:03.490
it might go more in the other
directions because these

00:08:03.490 --> 00:08:05.750
are gonna, they're gonna be
more likely to interact,

00:08:05.750 --> 00:08:06.950
Or if you provide more of this,

00:08:06.950 --> 00:08:08.450
it might go in the other direction

00:08:08.450 --> 00:08:12.190
because these might more likely react

00:08:12.190 --> 00:08:16.150
with their surroundings or
disassociate in some way.

00:08:16.150 --> 00:08:18.020
Now just to get a sense of, you know,

00:08:18.020 --> 00:08:20.020
it's nice to kind of, you
know, are these just some

00:08:20.020 --> 00:08:21.550
random letters that I wrote here?

00:08:21.550 --> 00:08:25.150
Carbonic acid is actually an
incredibly important molecule,

00:08:25.150 --> 00:08:26.920
or we could call it a
compound because it's made up

00:08:26.920 --> 00:08:29.090
of two or, two or more elements,

00:08:29.090 --> 00:08:31.250
in living systems and in fact,

00:08:31.250 --> 00:08:33.390
you know, even in the environment.

00:08:33.390 --> 00:08:36.090
And even when you go out
to get some fast food.

00:08:36.090 --> 00:08:38.650
When you have carbonated
drinks, it has carbonic acid

00:08:38.650 --> 00:08:41.620
in it that disassociates
into carbon dioxide

00:08:41.620 --> 00:08:44.150
and that carbon dioxide is
what you see bubbling up.

00:08:44.150 --> 00:08:47.520
Carbonic acid is incredibly
important in how your body

00:08:47.520 --> 00:08:52.420
deals with excess carbon
dioxide in its bloodstream.

00:08:52.420 --> 00:08:55.760
Carbonic acid is involved in the oceans

00:08:55.760 --> 00:08:58.720
taking up carbon dioxide
from the atmosphere.

00:08:58.720 --> 00:09:00.280
So when you're studying chemistry,

00:09:00.280 --> 00:09:03.220
especially in the context of
biology, these aren't just,

00:09:03.220 --> 00:09:05.920
you know, interesting things
that seem very academic.

00:09:05.920 --> 00:09:09.890
These are effecting your
real life and your body

00:09:09.890 --> 00:09:11.340
and your environment.
