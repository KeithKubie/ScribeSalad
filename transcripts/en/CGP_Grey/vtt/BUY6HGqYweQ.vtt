00:00:00.539 --> 00:00:02.150
How to become the British Monarch:

00:00:02.150 --> 00:00:06.390
Historically, the crown sat upon your head
mostly because you had the biggest army.

00:00:06.390 --> 00:00:10.480
When you died usually your eldest son kept
control over that army and so the crown relocated

00:00:10.480 --> 00:00:14.940
to his head, though, of course, someone with
a bigger army could change the political landscape

00:00:14.940 --> 00:00:16.170
quite abruptly.

00:00:16.170 --> 00:00:20.540
As time marched on and the world grew less
violent eventually in 1701 Parliament established

00:00:20.540 --> 00:00:24.450
a set of rules to transfer the crown from
one head to another -- hopefully with less

00:00:24.450 --> 00:00:26.140
turmoil than before.

00:00:26.140 --> 00:00:28.350
So here's how the 1701 rules work:

00:00:28.350 --> 00:00:29.770
Frist: don't be Catholic.

00:00:29.770 --> 00:00:33.520
The British Monarch is also the head of the
Church of England to which the monarch much

00:00:33.520 --> 00:00:35.550
convert if not already a member.

00:00:35.550 --> 00:00:38.230
Except that if you're Catholic, no crown for
you.

00:00:38.230 --> 00:00:42.460
The history of the royal family and how this
rule came to be is a story for another time,

00:00:42.460 --> 00:00:45.780
but suffice it to say that bigger-army diplomacy
was involved.

00:00:45.780 --> 00:00:50.130
And, BTW, no you can't cleverly get around
this rule by converting from Catholicism to

00:00:50.130 --> 00:00:52.510
something else then to Church of England.

00:00:52.510 --> 00:00:55.110
In the eyes of the crown, Catholicism is transitive.

00:00:55.110 --> 00:00:57.380
Second: don't be a bastard.

00:00:57.380 --> 00:01:00.920
Sometimes it's good to be the king, but it's
never good to be the illegitimate children

00:01:00.920 --> 00:01:05.630
of the king -- who are out of line for the
crown literally from the moment of their conception.

00:01:05.630 --> 00:01:09.901
If you're related to the monarch but are either
a Catholic or a bastard or both, the crown

00:01:09.901 --> 00:01:15.110
has the delightful term 'Naturally Dead' to
refer to you and your lack of right to succession.

00:01:15.110 --> 00:01:17.200
Third spouses don't count.

00:01:17.200 --> 00:01:21.800
While people often think of kings and queens
as a pair: that's not the way it works here.

00:01:21.800 --> 00:01:23.860
Spouses of Monarchs are known as Royal Consorts.

00:01:23.860 --> 00:01:27.510
They may be called 'prince' or 'queen' but
as far as the crown is concerned, they're

00:01:27.510 --> 00:01:32.610
not in line for the throne, they're just the
matching 23 Chromosomes needed for the creation

00:01:32.610 --> 00:01:33.810
of the real heir.

00:01:33.810 --> 00:01:38.900
Fourth and Finally: Male Primogeniture (whatever).

00:01:38.900 --> 00:01:40.890
This is the algorithm of inheritance.

00:01:40.890 --> 00:01:45.110
When the Monarch dies -- or abdicates -- but
usually dies -- the crown goes to the eldest

00:01:45.110 --> 00:01:46.760
son who isn't 'naturally dead'.

00:01:46.760 --> 00:01:51.490
If there happens to be an elder daughter tough
luck to her: baby brother gets the crown.

00:01:51.490 --> 00:01:56.270
It's Simple enough, but there are non-obvious
cases: take a king with two sons: if the eldest

00:01:56.270 --> 00:02:01.520
dies before the king does, obviously the crown
goes to the youngest (now oldest) brother.

00:02:01.520 --> 00:02:04.950
But what if the eldest son gave the king a
grandson before death?

00:02:04.950 --> 00:02:06.420
Where does the crown go then?

00:02:06.420 --> 00:02:10.379
Well, the crown basically pretends that everyone
-- except the naturally dead -- is alive:

00:02:10.379 --> 00:02:14.620
so upon the death of the king the crown goes
to his eldest son -- who is now sort of the

00:02:14.620 --> 00:02:19.029
king who just really happens to be dead -- so
the rule kicks in again, and the crown goes

00:02:19.029 --> 00:02:22.560
to *his* son, not as seems obvious now, his
brother.

00:02:22.560 --> 00:02:27.169
But if this 1701 rule means that eldest sons
get the crown, how did queens ever come to

00:02:27.169 --> 00:02:28.169
be?

00:02:28.169 --> 00:02:31.529
Basically, daughters were the last choice
of the crown, which is why there have been

00:02:31.529 --> 00:02:32.609
so few.

00:02:32.609 --> 00:02:36.840
To get the crown, a daughter had to be either
the only child of the monarch or the eldest

00:02:36.840 --> 00:02:38.939
child without competing brothers.

00:02:38.939 --> 00:02:44.019
So pregnant mothers must have made any daughters
with queenly aspirations quite nervous.

00:02:44.019 --> 00:02:48.599
Now sometimes the branch of a family tree
die out: be it from war or plague or whatever

00:02:48.599 --> 00:02:52.650
so the crown's contingency plan if it's at
a dead end is to back up one level, and then

00:02:52.650 --> 00:02:56.559
apply the rules forward again looking for
a living head to sit upon.

00:02:56.559 --> 00:03:01.860
If no luck, back up again, and repeat and
repeat until a living heir is found.

00:03:01.860 --> 00:03:03.580
And there will always be an heir.

00:03:03.580 --> 00:03:08.109
The first king of England was over a thousand
years ago and the mathematics of human reproduction

00:03:08.109 --> 00:03:13.189
backed up by DNA evidence reveals that just
about every European alive is distantly related

00:03:13.189 --> 00:03:14.189
to him.

00:03:14.189 --> 00:03:16.519
So the crown will eventually find a way.

00:03:16.519 --> 00:03:20.590
So from the first king through the new millennium,
the various rules when along, making monarchs,

00:03:20.590 --> 00:03:24.699
though with a gender biased result, that no
one seemed too bothered about until suddenly,

00:03:24.699 --> 00:03:30.109
in 2013 for no particular reason at all, everyone
decided that the rules needed to be updated

00:03:30.109 --> 00:03:31.250
*right now*.

00:03:31.250 --> 00:03:35.620
So, Parliament and the Monarchy got together
and made some changes: most notably striking

00:03:35.620 --> 00:03:38.059
the male part of rule #4.

00:03:38.059 --> 00:03:42.829
From 2013 on the crown views all royal sons
and daughters with equal favor.

00:03:42.829 --> 00:03:45.730
The only thing that matters is the order of
their birth.

00:03:45.730 --> 00:03:50.510
So prior to 2013 the boy in a set of fraternal
twins in development could sit back and relax

00:03:50.510 --> 00:03:53.999
-- secure that the crown would be his no matter
what happened on delivery day, but in the

00:03:53.999 --> 00:03:59.289
post 2013 gender-equal world it's now a race
for the door to win the crown.
