&gt;&gt;Julie Wiskirken: Greetings everybody I'm
Julia Wiskirken from the authors at Google

00:00:03.540 --> 00:00:10.510
team in Los Angeles and today we're very excited
to welcome Seth Grahame-Smith.

00:00:10.510 --> 00:00:14.740
Seth had visited us once before about three
years ago when things were just starting to

00:00:14.740 --> 00:00:20.270
take off for him with the Pride and Prejudice
and Zombies and since then it's been a whirlwind

00:00:20.270 --> 00:00:26.529
of activity and he was the co-creator, executive
producer of the MTV series the Hard Times

00:00:26.529 --> 00:00:28.230
of RJ Berger.

00:00:28.230 --> 00:00:32.619
He wrote the New York Times best seller Abraham
Lincoln Vampire Hunter and he adapted it for

00:00:32.619 --> 00:00:34.739
the screen it's coming out this summer.

00:00:34.739 --> 00:00:38.660
And he also wrote the screen play for Tim
Burton's Dark Shadows which is coming out

00:00:38.660 --> 00:00:40.250
in a few weeks.

00:00:40.250 --> 00:00:44.729
So and to end besides all that he has another
new book which is Unholy Night which just

00:00:44.729 --> 00:00:48.049
came out yesterday and he is here to talk
to us about it today.

00:00:48.049 --> 00:00:52.059
So let's welcome Seth.
[applause]

00:00:52.059 --> 00:00:56.170
&gt;&gt;Seth Grahame-Smith: Thanks Julie.

00:00:56.170 --> 00:01:01.969
Thanks everybody for taking time out of lunch
to come and hang out.

00:01:01.969 --> 00:01:06.960
I'm excited to be here I had a great time
last time I was at Google.

00:01:06.960 --> 00:01:12.760
Let me open with some pandering I guess.

00:01:12.760 --> 00:01:16.630
What I do in books would be impossible without
you guys.

00:01:16.630 --> 00:01:20.170
And we were just talking about this a minute
ago.

00:01:20.170 --> 00:01:26.619
But the type of books that I write are research
intensive and I know that sounds crazy because

00:01:26.619 --> 00:01:31.329
on the surface they're absurd and Abraham
Lincoln did not actually fight vampires as

00:01:31.329 --> 00:01:37.749
far as I know and the three wise men were
not so far as I know swash buckling marauders.

00:01:37.749 --> 00:01:44.829
But I like to weave in as much fact into my
fiction as I possibly can and in order to

00:01:44.829 --> 00:01:53.350
do that I need to do quite a bit of research
and fifteen years ago I would've God forbid

00:01:53.350 --> 00:01:58.759
actually had to go to a brick and mortar library
and not just any library but a research library

00:01:58.759 --> 00:02:01.259
specific to the topic I was trying to research.

00:02:01.259 --> 00:02:07.840
If I was doing Unholy Night who knows I might
have had to go to Jerusalem and combed through

00:02:07.840 --> 00:02:12.680
some old New Testament Apocrypha and find
out what I was writing about or if I was writing

00:02:12.680 --> 00:02:17.010
Lincoln I would have to go to Springfield
and comb through the archives at the Lincoln

00:02:17.010 --> 00:02:19.090
Museum and Library.

00:02:19.090 --> 00:02:21.599
Now I can do it all from home.

00:02:21.599 --> 00:02:29.519
And there is a danger to that because you
have to not only go online and research things

00:02:29.519 --> 00:02:33.620
but you have to be careful about which sites
you trust and which you don't you have to

00:02:33.620 --> 00:02:41.600
get multiple sources you actually have to
do some legwork but thanks to you guys and

00:02:41.600 --> 00:02:47.970
what goes on at Google and it's just I don't
know it's just completely changed my world

00:02:47.970 --> 00:02:49.760
personally as an author.

00:02:49.760 --> 00:02:54.840
So it's just, it's interesting to be here
and talk to you guys.

00:02:54.840 --> 00:03:00.820
I typically like to do a Q and A more than
a lecture because I don't really like the

00:03:00.820 --> 00:03:06.890
sound of myself lecturing at you and you guys
have better things to do than sit here and

00:03:06.890 --> 00:03:07.890
listen.

00:03:07.890 --> 00:03:12.480
But I will tell you a little bit about how
this particular book came to be.

00:03:12.480 --> 00:03:16.709
Now last time I was here at Goggle I had just
written Pride and Prejudice and Zombies and

00:03:16.709 --> 00:03:21.700
it was the sorta the beginning of the book
getting some notoriety.

00:03:21.700 --> 00:03:26.959
As a result to that I came to see you guys,
I went on a book tour all over the country

00:03:26.959 --> 00:03:33.600
and no matter where I went every book store,
this is back three years ago when there was

00:03:33.600 --> 00:03:35.810
such a thing as book stores I don't know if
you guys remember-

00:03:35.810 --> 00:03:37.140
[chuckles]
&gt;&gt;Seth Grahame-Smith: You use to actually

00:03:37.140 --> 00:03:41.510
physically go and buy books at brick and mortar
stores.

00:03:41.510 --> 00:03:46.799
No matter what store I would go into anywhere
in the country this is 2009 so it was the

00:03:46.799 --> 00:03:52.670
bicentennial of Abraham Lincoln's birth and
it was also the absolute pinnacle the height

00:03:52.670 --> 00:03:55.150
of the Twilight phenomena in literature.

00:03:55.150 --> 00:03:57.459
This is like just as the movies were starting
to come out.

00:03:57.459 --> 00:04:01.700
So no matter where I was I would see two tables
in the front of every book store.

00:04:01.700 --> 00:04:06.629
There'd be the Twilight, True Blood table
right here and then there'd be the Abraham

00:04:06.629 --> 00:04:07.840
Lincoln biography table.

00:04:07.840 --> 00:04:13.189
And so I had made this cynical observation,
"boy if you could combine those two things

00:04:13.189 --> 00:04:14.189
you know,
[laughter]

00:04:14.189 --> 00:04:17.040
&gt;&gt;Seth Grahame-Smith: that would be a license
to print money right there

00:04:17.040 --> 00:04:18.040
[laughter]
&gt;&gt;Seth Grahame-Smith: that's what that would

00:04:18.040 --> 00:04:19.830
be.

00:04:19.830 --> 00:04:25.770
And so this cynical observation led me as
it always does into a real research mode.

00:04:25.770 --> 00:04:32.020
So I got on my browser--Chrome pandering.

00:04:32.020 --> 00:04:36.890
[laughter]
&gt;&gt;Seth Grahame-Smith: And low and behold I

00:04:36.890 --> 00:04:41.730
fell in love with the actual life story of
Abraham Lincoln which I didn't at that point

00:04:41.730 --> 00:04:46.470
know that much about I knew, five dollar bill,
honest, axe, top hat okay just the things

00:04:46.470 --> 00:04:50.470
we always that are in our DNA from the time
we're elementary school kids.

00:04:50.470 --> 00:04:54.210
If you grow up in the United States that's
the four things you know about Lincoln.

00:04:54.210 --> 00:04:58.230
What I didn't know is that his story was a
super hero origin story and I'm not talking

00:04:58.230 --> 00:05:01.720
about the one that I wrote I'm talking about
the real one.

00:05:01.720 --> 00:05:07.690
He is a guy with absolutely no education no
money no family connections he's awkward and

00:05:07.690 --> 00:05:15.360
gangly he looks funny, he can't read and his
mom mysteriously dies when he's nine years

00:05:15.360 --> 00:05:19.990
old and then that sets off a chain of events
where tragedy upon tragedy upon tragedy, there's

00:05:19.990 --> 00:05:24.871
not a two year period in Lincoln's life after
he's nine years old that he doesn't, some

00:05:24.871 --> 00:05:29.630
great tragedy befalls him and he has to pull
himself up by his boot straps get over his

00:05:29.630 --> 00:05:34.910
suicidal tendencies, his melancholy, his famous
depression and just go on and so I became

00:05:34.910 --> 00:05:41.300
fascinated with it and fascinated with how
that guy became arguably the greatest American

00:05:41.300 --> 00:05:48.060
possibly and certainly if not the greatest
one of the greatest American presidents.

00:05:48.060 --> 00:05:49.320
Where did he get that strength?

00:05:49.320 --> 00:05:52.740
Where did he put the country on his shoulders
and pull back together etcetera.

00:05:52.740 --> 00:05:58.010
So once I realized that this was a superhero
origin story it's like alright well now I

00:05:58.010 --> 00:06:04.330
know a way to make it work with the vampires
where it's not just going to be, a weird sort

00:06:04.330 --> 00:06:09.470
of conversion of all these facts and fictions
so Abraham Lincoln Vampire Hunter low and

00:06:09.470 --> 00:06:15.110
behold, it was gonna be scrutinized because
it was the first thing I was doing after Pride

00:06:15.110 --> 00:06:20.850
and Prejudice and low and behold it worked
and book came out did very well all of a sudden

00:06:20.850 --> 00:06:25.120
I got a call from Tim Burton, "hey do you
wanna make a movie?" and I said, "great, I

00:06:25.120 --> 00:06:27.000
think I can fit that into my schedule."

00:06:27.000 --> 00:06:30.700
[chuckles]
&gt;&gt;Seth Grahame-Smith: So I wrote the screen

00:06:30.700 --> 00:06:35.550
play for, and then, Tim was the producer on
that and then after I wrote the screen play

00:06:35.550 --> 00:06:38.640
for Lincoln he said, "Hey I really like the
screen play do you wanna write Dark Shadows?"

00:06:38.640 --> 00:06:40.660
I said, "I think I can fit that in."

00:06:40.660 --> 00:06:44.120
[chuckles]
&gt;&gt;Seth Grahame-Smith: And in the meantime

00:06:44.120 --> 00:06:47.930
so before, I knew, before my head had stopped
spinning literally like the last time I was

00:06:47.930 --> 00:06:52.930
in the old Google building here in LA and
doing one of these my head had just started

00:06:52.930 --> 00:06:58.740
to spin and before it stopped I found myself
in London at Pinewood Studios on the set of

00:06:58.740 --> 00:07:05.240
Dark Shadows and here we were we were writing
and during that time I was also starting to

00:07:05.240 --> 00:07:10.610
write Unholy Night and Unholy Night had a
very different sort of, for a lack of better

00:07:10.610 --> 00:07:16.610
word genesis not pun intended but it wasn't
one of those things where it started as an

00:07:16.610 --> 00:07:17.740
observation.

00:07:17.740 --> 00:07:21.160
The idea for Unholy Night came to me out of
the blue.

00:07:21.160 --> 00:07:24.730
Stephen King I don't know if anybody here
has ever read his book on writing.

00:07:24.730 --> 00:07:29.630
But he talks about how there in his mind there
are these men in the basement that are sitting

00:07:29.630 --> 00:07:33.980
around a table talking about ideas and coming
up with things, and then when that ideas ready

00:07:33.980 --> 00:07:37.870
whether you're ready for it or not it goes
into the vacuum tube and goes upstairs to

00:07:37.870 --> 00:07:40.020
your brain and it just hits you.

00:07:40.020 --> 00:07:44.940
That never happens to me, my men in the basement
are probably all dead or lazy or something

00:07:44.940 --> 00:07:45.940
but
[laughter]

00:07:45.940 --> 00:07:49.490
&gt;&gt;Seth Grahame-Smith: I really have to whip
them into shape to like no let's work on this

00:07:49.490 --> 00:07:51.380
idea let's develop this idea.

00:07:51.380 --> 00:07:56.240
This was one of those things where I was here
in LA it was the middle of July or maybe June

00:07:56.240 --> 00:08:03.500
it was summer it was hot and I was driving
up Robertson to what is now an empty store

00:08:03.500 --> 00:08:09.390
but use to be a Blockbuster to return a digital
versatile disk you remember those DVD's right.

00:08:09.390 --> 00:08:13.510
And you also remember Blockbuster before we,
you know.

00:08:13.510 --> 00:08:16.040
So again back in the old days two years ago.

00:08:16.040 --> 00:08:19.070
[chuckles]
&gt;&gt;Seth Grahame-Smith: And I was pulling into

00:08:19.070 --> 00:08:24.150
the parking lot on this and just this question
just popped into my mind fully formed what

00:08:24.150 --> 00:08:26.490
were the three wise men doing there really?

00:08:26.490 --> 00:08:30.520
And that was is it that was the question and
it wasn't as if I was driving around New England

00:08:30.520 --> 00:08:33.709
and looking at all the nativity scenes on
the front lawns and seeing the three wise

00:08:33.709 --> 00:08:38.979
men lit up in plastic form and say, "Who the
hell are those guys really?"

00:08:38.979 --> 00:08:45.100
This just came out of nowhere and it was an
intriguing question once again it led me into

00:08:45.100 --> 00:08:56.520
my research mode which was, back on my then
updated latest beta of Chrome which was phenomenal

00:08:56.520 --> 00:08:58.630
and not buggy at all and it was great.

00:08:58.630 --> 00:09:02.410
[chuckles]
&gt;&gt;Seth Grahame-Smith: And reading essentially

00:09:02.410 --> 00:09:04.779
passages from The New Testament.

00:09:04.779 --> 00:09:09.720
Reading about how much do we know about the
three wise men from The New Testament turns

00:09:09.720 --> 00:09:15.060
out virtually nothing and that really excited
me that intrigued me it's like the Gospel

00:09:15.060 --> 00:09:19.680
of Luke and the Gospel of Matthew that's only
time you ever hear them mentioned.

00:09:19.680 --> 00:09:23.779
All we know are basically the same four things
we know about Lincoln but in this case the

00:09:23.779 --> 00:09:29.470
four things are come from the east, there's
three of them, they stop at Herod's they go

00:09:29.470 --> 00:09:34.529
from Herod's to a manger in Bethlehem with
gold, frankincense, and myrrh pay their respects

00:09:34.529 --> 00:09:36.830
on their way never to be heard from again.

00:09:36.830 --> 00:09:42.040
Now that's, that to me is there's a lot of
room there to mess with that.

00:09:42.040 --> 00:09:45.170
[chuckles]
&gt;&gt;Seth Grahame-Smith: And so I got really

00:09:45.170 --> 00:09:49.220
excited by the where'd they get the gold,
frankincense, and myrrh?

00:09:49.220 --> 00:09:52.800
Could they have say stolen it?

00:09:52.800 --> 00:09:55.300
Why were they going to that manager that night?

00:09:55.300 --> 00:09:59.060
Was it to pay their respects or was it perhaps
to find a place to hide because they had just

00:09:59.060 --> 00:10:03.639
stolen gold and frankincense, so it starts
the ball rolling in your mind of like who

00:10:03.639 --> 00:10:06.339
are these guys?

00:10:06.339 --> 00:10:10.209
And it the process got rolling and I whipping
my men in the basement into shape and they

00:10:10.209 --> 00:10:13.589
were getting on board with it and we were
all developing the idea and then I stopped

00:10:13.589 --> 00:10:16.800
because I got really scared.

00:10:16.800 --> 00:10:22.440
Because I had just been through the experience
of coming face to face with lifelong Jane

00:10:22.440 --> 00:10:25.690
Austen fans who were like, "How dare you?"

00:10:25.690 --> 00:10:28.850
[laughter]
&gt;&gt;Seth Grahame-Smith: And coming face to face

00:10:28.850 --> 00:10:33.540
with some Lincoln scholars that were like,
"Yo, I don't even understand this, what are

00:10:33.540 --> 00:10:34.540
you doing?"
[chuckles]

00:10:34.540 --> 00:10:40.020
&gt;&gt;Seth Grahame-Smith: Now in all fairness
most of the people that are the biggest fans

00:10:40.020 --> 00:10:43.959
of PPZ are Jane Austen's fans like life-long
fans.

00:10:43.959 --> 00:10:50.920
And the vast majority of Jane Austen fans
are totally on board with my bastardization

00:10:50.920 --> 00:10:52.980
of it.

00:10:52.980 --> 00:10:57.019
Also to be fair the Lincoln community and
there is such a thing this community of historians

00:10:57.019 --> 00:11:03.430
and scholars and lovers of Lincoln are almost
universally behind Abraham Lincoln Vampire

00:11:03.430 --> 00:11:07.640
Hunter because they appreciate it for what
it is and it's not cheapening the legacy of

00:11:07.640 --> 00:11:10.769
the real guy it's just brining new people
into the tent.

00:11:10.769 --> 00:11:17.499
So I've been really lucky twice but I didn't
think that I would be so lucky the third time.

00:11:17.499 --> 00:11:21.769
Because it's a little different when you're
dealing with the birth of Jesus-

00:11:21.769 --> 00:11:25.380
[chuckles]
&gt;&gt;Seth Grahame-Smith: than dealing with a

00:11:25.380 --> 00:11:27.860
Regency era romance novel.

00:11:27.860 --> 00:11:30.750
As beloved as it is it's just a little different.

00:11:30.750 --> 00:11:36.230
So I really had to sit and think about, "Okay
what am I trying to say here?"

00:11:36.230 --> 00:11:41.949
And I made some very concrete decisions early
on before I wrote Unholy Night.

00:11:41.949 --> 00:11:47.790
Number one Jesus was never gonna be more that
a two week old infant I was not gonna get

00:11:47.790 --> 00:11:52.990
into the business of putting words into the
mouth of Jesus so that was number one.

00:11:52.990 --> 00:11:57.100
And in fact Jesus the word never even appears
in the book it's always the infant or the

00:11:57.100 --> 00:12:00.240
child even though it's all, everybody knows
who it is.

00:12:00.240 --> 00:12:06.430
Number two Joseph and Mary always had to be
the paragons of virtue.

00:12:06.430 --> 00:12:14.610
I wasn't about to have, I wasn't gonna do
to Mary the mother of Jesus what I did to

00:12:14.610 --> 00:12:19.740
Lizzy in PPZ where she is a blood thirsty
sword woman and all that stuff, that was not

00:12:19.740 --> 00:12:20.740
her turf.

00:12:20.740 --> 00:12:24.240
They were just Joseph and Mary as you know
and loved them in the Bible.

00:12:24.240 --> 00:12:28.410
Faithful devote committed believers.

00:12:28.410 --> 00:12:32.379
And then number three I wanted the book to
say something about faith.

00:12:32.379 --> 00:12:38.709
I didn't want it to just be like this romp
where I'm using Christianity as my canvas

00:12:38.709 --> 00:12:41.230
I wanted to actually have a message.

00:12:41.230 --> 00:12:46.059
Now my own personal religious history is a
little checkered I was born Seth Greenberg

00:12:46.059 --> 00:12:49.259
not exactly a Christian name.

00:12:49.259 --> 00:12:53.939
Then when I was three my parents split up
and my sort of wonderfully crazy mother who

00:12:53.939 --> 00:12:58.850
was an English major loved the author the
English author Kenneth Grahame, Wind of the

00:12:58.850 --> 00:13:05.149
Willows things like that and legally changed
my name when i was three to Grahame.

00:13:05.149 --> 00:13:06.149
So stay with me.

00:13:06.149 --> 00:13:07.800
[chuckles]
&gt;&gt;Seth Grahame-Smith: and then when I'm five

00:13:07.800 --> 00:13:13.569
she marries an Episcopalian Smith and then
rather than saddling me with the unfortunately

00:13:13.569 --> 00:13:18.220
alliterative Seth Smith she's like, "Maybe
we should hyphenate."

00:13:18.220 --> 00:13:26.240
So that's how I became Seth Grahame-Smith
when I was five and it's also how I started

00:13:26.240 --> 00:13:31.499
learning about Christianity because I was
this little five year old Jewish kid with

00:13:31.499 --> 00:13:35.949
all these Jewish relatives and all this Jewish
lineage who all of a sudden was an Episcopal

00:13:35.949 --> 00:13:38.770
altar boy, seriously, literally, altar boy.

00:13:38.770 --> 00:13:41.699
[laughter]
&gt;&gt;Seth Grahame-Smith: And so I've always see

00:13:41.699 --> 00:13:47.980
myself as kind of straddling these two worlds
and this was a very interesting exercise for

00:13:47.980 --> 00:13:54.410
me because while it is about essentially the
birth of Christianity almost everyone in Unholy

00:13:54.410 --> 00:13:56.720
Night is either an Arab or a Jew.

00:13:56.720 --> 00:14:00.050
Cuz it turns out there weren't any Christians
back then.

00:14:00.050 --> 00:14:06.699
So it was interesting from that point to sorta
delve back into really religious text reading

00:14:06.699 --> 00:14:11.519
the New Testament going back and reading the
Old Testament for background and for mythology

00:14:11.519 --> 00:14:18.279
and then reading the Apocrypha that's written
centuries after The New Testament there's

00:14:18.279 --> 00:14:22.100
actually a great tradition that sprung up
in Europe especially about the three wise

00:14:22.100 --> 00:14:26.079
men and in Asia everyone wants to claim them
as their own even though they don't really

00:14:26.079 --> 00:14:30.820
appear in the Bible that much after, at all
after they leave.

00:14:30.820 --> 00:14:36.170
There's great traditions and festivals dedicated
to them in Europe in the book that's where

00:14:36.170 --> 00:14:40.910
the names of the three wise men come for Gaspar,
Melchior, and Balthazar are the traditional

00:14:40.910 --> 00:14:45.139
three names of the wise men and I don't know
where they came from but somebody decided

00:14:45.139 --> 00:14:47.899
that was the case so that's what I stuck to.

00:14:47.899 --> 00:14:52.820
So anyways the point being I really wanted
to say something about faith I didn't want

00:14:52.820 --> 00:14:58.940
to pander and be, I'm afraid of Christian
backlash so therefore I'm gonna overdo it.

00:14:58.940 --> 00:15:05.040
But I also didn't want to offend anyone's
sensibility so that's a real tight rope.

00:15:05.040 --> 00:15:11.360
I wanted devout Christians to be able to read
this and go, "Wow what a great fun ride and

00:15:11.360 --> 00:15:13.889
it made me think weirdly differently about
my faith."

00:15:13.889 --> 00:15:18.601
And I wanted staunch agnostic or atheistic
to be able to read this and go, "Wow what

00:15:18.601 --> 00:15:20.670
a fun ride."

00:15:20.670 --> 00:15:28.149
So that's a tough one and we'll see if it
happens that way or not but it was a fun one

00:15:28.149 --> 00:15:32.889
to write and it was a real challenging one
to write because unlike Lincoln I didn't have

00:15:32.889 --> 00:15:38.300
the crutch of everyday of Lincoln's life at
this point has been chronicled.

00:15:38.300 --> 00:15:43.139
I can go on there's a site called the Lincoln
Log where you can literally enter a date at

00:15:43.139 --> 00:15:47.110
any point of Lincoln's existence and there
is a check that he signed from that day for

00:15:47.110 --> 00:15:53.839
groceries or there's Lincoln wrote a letter
to Mary about this on this day you know everything

00:15:53.839 --> 00:15:57.740
and so if I get lost in the narrative I'm
like well what was Lincoln really doing okay

00:15:57.740 --> 00:16:00.499
I'll write about that.

00:16:00.499 --> 00:16:07.269
Now you have Scripture and a tradition of
the Nativity and you know that baby Jesus

00:16:07.269 --> 00:16:13.869
had to get out of Judea and into Egypt before
Herod got his hands on him but you don't know

00:16:13.869 --> 00:16:18.779
how he got there you don't know what happened
after he got there so that was where I had

00:16:18.779 --> 00:16:26.389
to invent within the lines of various pieces
of Scripture.

00:16:26.389 --> 00:16:29.879
So that's how the book came to be.

00:16:29.879 --> 00:16:32.639
It came out yesterday and I just don't know.

00:16:32.639 --> 00:16:40.100
I'm in that zone right now where I got a an
email from my publisher this morning and she

00:16:40.100 --> 00:16:47.709
said, "Unlike a movie or anything like that
the release date of a book is the day where

00:16:47.709 --> 00:16:53.939
the author gets all dressed up in the tuxedo
and gets ready and does his hair all perfect

00:16:53.939 --> 00:16:55.930
and then nothing happens."

00:16:55.930 --> 00:16:59.279
[laughter]
&gt;&gt;Seth Grahame-Smith: Because books are different

00:16:59.279 --> 00:17:03.480
it's not a movie where I'm not checking my
watch to see where the grosses come in tonight

00:17:03.480 --> 00:17:05.720
and we'll know how we're doing.

00:17:05.720 --> 00:17:11.240
It takes time you don't know and reviews make
the difference and books are much more of

00:17:11.240 --> 00:17:19.800
a slowly chumming word of mouth thing so that's
why I'm here hocking my goods to you fine

00:17:19.800 --> 00:17:28.060
people, but with that I was hoping to kinda
turn it over to some questions and to see

00:17:28.060 --> 00:17:31.290
what sorts of things interest you guys.

00:17:31.290 --> 00:17:37.860
I'm certainly interested in what you guys
do we were just talking before about, I was

00:17:37.860 --> 00:17:41.770
asking so what specifically happens in this
office versus other Google offices well it

00:17:41.770 --> 00:17:45.430
sounds like everything happens here it sounds
like Chrome happens here and YouTube happens

00:17:45.430 --> 00:17:49.890
here and it sounds those awesome new Google
glasses that I'm sure you guys are gonna let

00:17:49.890 --> 00:17:51.470
me try out before I leave
[laughter]

00:17:51.470 --> 00:17:52.620
&gt;&gt;Seth Grahame-Smith: happen here.

00:17:52.620 --> 00:17:58.040
And otherwise I'm gonna make one of those
parodies you guys watch out, that are

00:17:58.040 --> 00:18:01.320
[laughter]
&gt;&gt;Seth: But no it's really exciting but what's

00:18:01.320 --> 00:18:04.970
exciting to me is again I'm going back again
into pandering mode but it's pandering with

00:18:04.970 --> 00:18:10.660
truth it, what's exciting to me is that everything
you guys do in this building I use as a tool

00:18:10.660 --> 00:18:12.530
for what I do.

00:18:12.530 --> 00:18:17.860
The book trailers for my books launch on YouTube,
the one for Lincoln about a million and a

00:18:17.860 --> 00:18:23.740
half hits now it's crazy and that book trailer
that we just uploaded to YouTube completely

00:18:23.740 --> 00:18:29.090
set the tone for the whole campaign for the
book.

00:18:29.090 --> 00:18:34.490
I have to do a Hangout I have to I have my
Google plus all set up but I have to do Hangout

00:18:34.490 --> 00:18:36.910
so I apologize for not having done one yet.

00:18:36.910 --> 00:18:43.170
But I use your browser, I use your video,
I use in the future I'm sure I'll use your

00:18:43.170 --> 00:18:45.240
glasses too.

00:18:45.240 --> 00:18:46.840
But so it's really cool.

00:18:46.840 --> 00:18:51.630
So if you guys have questions for me that
would be exciting because I do better in a

00:18:51.630 --> 00:18:54.410
conversation format than I do in a lecture
format.

00:18:54.410 --> 00:18:55.410
Yes.

00:18:55.410 --> 00:19:00.600
&gt;&gt; man 1: The obvious question when are you
gonna start work on Sergey Brin the Batman?

00:19:00.600 --> 00:19:03.670
[laughter]
&gt;&gt;Seth: Oh man, listen

00:19:03.670 --> 00:19:06.540
[laughter]
&gt;&gt;Seth Grahame-Smith: Sergey Brin the Batman

00:19:06.540 --> 00:19:11.920
I mean you think about it he's first of all
he's one of the few guys in the world that

00:19:11.920 --> 00:19:13.480
could actually afford to do that.

00:19:13.480 --> 00:19:15.730
[laughter]
&gt;&gt;Seth Grahame-Smith: Already has his own

00:19:15.730 --> 00:19:19.870
awesome plane from what I hear.

00:19:19.870 --> 00:19:26.510
Has bat glasses with facial recognition and
man that's a great idea.

00:19:26.510 --> 00:19:30.170
Listen I will do it, I'll start tomorrow if
I can get paid in stock.

00:19:30.170 --> 00:19:34.450
[laughter]
&gt;&gt;Seth Grahame-Smith: So hopefully Sergey's

00:19:34.450 --> 00:19:37.800
watching, yeah available anytime you know
how to reach me.

00:19:37.800 --> 00:19:39.200
[laughter]
&gt;&gt;Seth Grahame-Smith: Yes

00:19:39.200 --> 00:19:45.670
&gt;&gt;woman 1: Hi Big fan of PPZ and looking forward
to reading this book.

00:19:45.670 --> 00:19:52.790
I was just concerned when you were talking
about it the reaction that you might get from

00:19:52.790 --> 00:19:55.770
some Christian fundamentalists.

00:19:55.770 --> 00:19:58.661
They can get pretty scary
&gt;&gt;Seth Grahame-Smith: sure

00:19:58.661 --> 00:20:04.540
&gt;&gt;woman 1: And I just kinda wanted to make
sure that you're fully aware of what you've

00:20:04.540 --> 00:20:05.540
done
[laughter]

00:20:05.540 --> 00:20:07.220
&gt;&gt;woman 1: Cuz
&gt;&gt;Seth Grahame-Smith: Do you know what you've

00:20:07.220 --> 00:20:08.220
done?

00:20:08.220 --> 00:20:09.620
&gt;&gt;woman 1: There's some crazy people out there
&gt;&gt;Seth Grahame-Smith: Yeah

00:20:09.620 --> 00:20:10.940
&gt;&gt;woman 1: and they can be violent.

00:20:10.940 --> 00:20:13.170
&gt;&gt;Seth Grahame-Smith: And my picture is in
the book.

00:20:13.170 --> 00:20:14.170
&gt;&gt;woman 1: Yeah
[laughter]

00:20:14.170 --> 00:20:16.490
&gt;&gt;Seth Grahame-Smith: Yes, and I'm doing this
I'm being recorded right now.

00:20:16.490 --> 00:20:18.360
[laughter]
&gt;&gt;Seth Grahame-Smith: I'm not and I'll tell

00:20:18.360 --> 00:20:19.360
you why.

00:20:19.360 --> 00:20:21.950
Is because I think that for two reasons.

00:20:21.950 --> 00:20:27.010
Number one there is always gonna be a group
of people you're never going to affect your

00:20:27.010 --> 00:20:29.070
just never gonna change an opinion.

00:20:29.070 --> 00:20:34.180
The fact that the wise men were even characters
in my book that Mary and Joseph were even

00:20:34.180 --> 00:20:36.680
characters in my book is gonna be offensive
to some people.

00:20:36.680 --> 00:20:38.160
I respect that.

00:20:38.160 --> 00:20:44.170
I think however, when people read the book
and they understand that the journey that

00:20:44.170 --> 00:20:47.860
Balthazar goes through in the book especially
because he's our way in he's the wise man

00:20:47.860 --> 00:20:50.260
who we care about the most in the book.

00:20:50.260 --> 00:20:53.240
He goes on a very positive pro-faith journey.

00:20:53.240 --> 00:20:59.960
And that was a choice and again I made a conscious
choice that I wanted to be exciting and entertaining

00:20:59.960 --> 00:21:04.060
and I wanted to be dark and bloody and cool
but not offensive.

00:21:04.060 --> 00:21:10.890
And what I did was I wanted the book again
to have a very pro-faith message.

00:21:10.890 --> 00:21:16.600
Balthazar when he begins is a staunch an atheist
as your even gonna find.

00:21:16.600 --> 00:21:21.710
He doesn't have any time for the old stories
he doesn't have any time for all that superstition

00:21:21.710 --> 00:21:22.710
and whatever.

00:21:22.710 --> 00:21:27.110
And he's got a very painful past that we sort
of come to know throughout the course of the

00:21:27.110 --> 00:21:28.260
book.

00:21:28.260 --> 00:21:34.340
By the end of the book he is not only saved
the baby Jesus but he's saved himself in order

00:21:34.340 --> 00:21:39.910
through his understanding of his openness
to belief, his openness to faith, and his

00:21:39.910 --> 00:21:46.310
openness to acceptance and so I think that
when people read the book and they understand

00:21:46.310 --> 00:21:47.740
that.

00:21:47.740 --> 00:21:54.100
I think that they'll realize that it is not
at any in any way a critique or criticism

00:21:54.100 --> 00:21:57.630
of faith it's actually a positive message
about faith.

00:21:57.630 --> 00:22:04.530
Just done in a very genre kinda crazy way
so believe me I thought about that a lot during

00:22:04.530 --> 00:22:10.280
the process and the last thing I wanted to
do was pit myself against any religious group

00:22:10.280 --> 00:22:11.280
or anything so.

00:22:11.280 --> 00:22:16.230
&gt;&gt;woman 1: The only other point that I would
make about that is that I'm not worried about

00:22:16.230 --> 00:22:17.880
the people who actually read the book.

00:22:17.880 --> 00:22:20.380
&gt;&gt;Seth Grahame-Smith: Sure
&gt;&gt;woman 1: I worry about the people who don't

00:22:20.380 --> 00:22:25.480
read the book who know basically that the
cliff notes the summary of what it's about

00:22:25.480 --> 00:22:31.650
or just the fact that he even goes in that
area in any kind of comedic manner.

00:22:31.650 --> 00:22:34.790
Those are the people to worry about cuz they're
the ignorant ones.

00:22:34.790 --> 00:22:36.410
They're the ones who are not gonna read it
and say.

00:22:36.410 --> 00:22:39.280
"Oh well this is actually pro-faith and it's
not that bad."

00:22:39.280 --> 00:22:42.570
&gt;&gt;Seth Grahame-Smith: Yeah, I think that there's
very really little I can do about that to

00:22:42.570 --> 00:22:43.570
be honest-
&gt;&gt;woman 1: Absolutely

00:22:43.570 --> 00:22:44.570
&gt;&gt;Seth Grahame-Smith: with you.

00:22:44.570 --> 00:22:45.570
There's really little I can do.

00:22:45.570 --> 00:22:46.570
I mean
&gt;&gt;woman 1: Except for get a body guard.

00:22:46.570 --> 00:22:52.420
&gt;&gt;Seth Grahame-Smith: No, No look I think
that first of all it would be flattering if

00:22:52.420 --> 00:22:56.560
people cared enough about the book to get
that worked up about it in a way because it's

00:22:56.560 --> 00:23:00.270
hard for books to get noticed these days.

00:23:00.270 --> 00:23:03.920
And I'm sure there are people that are in
my life that would be like, "I would welcome

00:23:03.920 --> 00:23:05.700
some controversy we would sell more books."

00:23:05.700 --> 00:23:12.840
Of course I have to deal with the fallout
personally but when Harry Potter came out

00:23:12.840 --> 00:23:18.130
there were probably 5% of people out there
that said it's about witchcraft we gotta ban

00:23:18.130 --> 00:23:21.990
it we gotta burn it we gotta keep our kids
away from it.

00:23:21.990 --> 00:23:27.470
I'm guessing that's the same 5% of people
that are just gonna be like, we gotta ban

00:23:27.470 --> 00:23:33.900
this book we gotta burn this book cuz it deals
with scared text and there's nothing I can

00:23:33.900 --> 00:23:39.890
do except repeatedly say the truth of, "This
is pro-faith and read the book, please read

00:23:39.890 --> 00:23:41.880
the book."

00:23:41.880 --> 00:23:50.500
But again I've been pleasantly surprised twice
now by the reaction of people who I was afraid

00:23:50.500 --> 00:23:53.130
of being really critiqued by and attacked
by.

00:23:53.130 --> 00:23:56.990
They either haven't critiqued and attacked
or they've read the book and have actually

00:23:56.990 --> 00:24:01.710
come around to enjoying it so, yeah.

00:24:01.710 --> 00:24:08.120
&gt;&gt;man 2: Coming off of adapting a book to
a movie was it hard to, were you tempted at

00:24:08.120 --> 00:24:13.030
all to write this keeping the future movie
in mind and setting things up to be stageable

00:24:13.030 --> 00:24:16.820
or did you really want it to be a book first
and who knows what will happen.

00:24:16.820 --> 00:24:18.510
&gt;&gt;Seth Grahame-Smith: That's a great question.

00:24:18.510 --> 00:24:24.180
I mean it was a challenge to be honest with
you not to write the movie of the book or

00:24:24.180 --> 00:24:27.380
the book of the movie or whatever.

00:24:27.380 --> 00:24:32.480
Coming off of adapting Lincoln I realized
that there were a lot of things I could've

00:24:32.480 --> 00:24:36.530
made my life easier that could've made my
life easier having written Lincoln the book

00:24:36.530 --> 00:24:38.720
like, having a central villain for one.

00:24:38.720 --> 00:24:41.110
My book doesn't have a central villain.

00:24:41.110 --> 00:24:42.600
Lincoln doesn't have a central villain.

00:24:42.600 --> 00:24:48.180
It doesn't have a thrilling climax it doesn't
have any of the real things that make a movie

00:24:48.180 --> 00:24:53.900
work and so the process for adapting Lincoln
was really laborious because a lot of that

00:24:53.900 --> 00:24:57.190
stuff had to be invented from scratch for
the movie.

00:24:57.190 --> 00:25:03.740
So I'm sure that subconsciously that effected,
for instance, Unholy Night has a very clear

00:25:03.740 --> 00:25:09.680
central villain, it has a thrilling climax,
it has all the things that were one to adapt

00:25:09.680 --> 00:25:12.590
it into a movie would make one's life easier.

00:25:12.590 --> 00:25:15.310
[chuckles]
&gt;&gt;Seth Grahame-Smith: But other than that

00:25:15.310 --> 00:25:20.210
I was coconscious also of not writing the
book of the movie.

00:25:20.210 --> 00:25:24.300
I didn't wanna I didn't want this book to
be the novelization of some future movie I

00:25:24.300 --> 00:25:29.970
wanted it to be a book and so I actually in
some cases went out of my way to write things

00:25:29.970 --> 00:25:37.190
that I knew were never going to be in the
movie they were just tangential or internal

00:25:37.190 --> 00:25:42.600
or but I'm sure that subconsciously I was
influenced.

00:25:42.600 --> 00:25:44.800
It's impossible to say that I wasn't.

00:25:44.800 --> 00:25:48.490
So how 'bout two more then I'll, you guys
can go back to work.

00:25:48.490 --> 00:25:50.290
&gt;&gt;woman 2: I've got one actually.

00:25:50.290 --> 00:25:52.400
&gt;&gt;Seth Grahame-Smith: Yes
&gt;&gt;woman 2: About your research on the Unholy

00:25:52.400 --> 00:25:53.400
Night.

00:25:53.400 --> 00:25:57.600
I don't remember their being a whole lot about
the wise men in the four gospels in the Bible

00:25:57.600 --> 00:25:59.920
and I'm just curious did you look at all of
those other gospels.

00:25:59.920 --> 00:26:03.100
&gt;&gt;Seth Grahame-Smith: Oh yeah
&gt;&gt;woman 2: And was there more in there or

00:26:03.100 --> 00:26:05.020
did you just kind of invent most of it?

00:26:05.020 --> 00:26:09.660
&gt;&gt;Seth Grahame-Smith: No, Matthew and Luke
is really were it all comes from and then

00:26:09.660 --> 00:26:16.930
there's also a lot of later text that the
Apocrypha they're called that are just sort

00:26:16.930 --> 00:26:22.160
of, whether they be like the Gnostic gospels
or things like that or even like the Koran

00:26:22.160 --> 00:26:30.360
has, there are parts of the Koran that deal
with Christ's journey as an infant so it's

00:26:30.360 --> 00:26:31.360
interesting.

00:26:31.360 --> 00:26:35.830
You take all these different sources and you
sort of put together a patch work of a truth

00:26:35.830 --> 00:26:36.830
of a story.

00:26:36.830 --> 00:26:44.770
We know their names are Balthazar, Melchior,
and Gaspar and you know that while Joseph

00:26:44.770 --> 00:26:49.010
and Mary were traveling with the baby Jesus
that certain miracles occur that we don't

00:26:49.010 --> 00:26:54.230
necessarily hear about in The New Testament
at least not The King James or The New International

00:26:54.230 --> 00:26:56.970
editions.

00:26:56.970 --> 00:27:03.820
So there are a lot of things in there that
are interesting but most of what we know about

00:27:03.820 --> 00:27:08.640
the wise men comes from oral tradition comes
from just stories that are handed down through

00:27:08.640 --> 00:27:15.090
the ages and legends that have sprung up around
them and not very much in the Bible itself

00:27:15.090 --> 00:27:20.440
which in a way was freeing but also in a way
made the job harder because so much has to

00:27:20.440 --> 00:27:24.960
be invented and yet be respectful and work
within the framework of what's there so how

00:27:24.960 --> 00:27:29.890
about one last question then we can, Yes okay.

00:27:29.890 --> 00:27:39.100
&gt;&gt;man 2: So for me as I was growing up there
was there are books that I distinctly remember

00:27:39.100 --> 00:27:43.350
and I think that it was just as I was reading
books and maturing that really stick in my

00:27:43.350 --> 00:27:49.030
head over time and I kind of always think
back to fondly upon those books and judge

00:27:49.030 --> 00:27:51.240
other books by those what kind of
&gt;&gt;Seth Grahame-Smith: Sure

00:27:51.240 --> 00:27:54.370
&gt;&gt; man 2: you know
&gt;&gt;Seth Grahame-Smith: Sure what are my sign

00:27:54.370 --> 00:27:57.180
post books the books that I hold up and.

00:27:57.180 --> 00:28:04.270
Well as a kid you know my dad, my step-father
was a used a rare book dealer and we had five

00:28:04.270 --> 00:28:10.290
thousand books in our basement that we converted
into a library and most of what he was interested

00:28:10.290 --> 00:28:17.140
in was genre was horror, science fiction,
fantasy and so I grew up being inundated with

00:28:17.140 --> 00:28:24.190
Heinlein, Asimov, with Bradbury and when I
was twelve it was King and King was king and

00:28:24.190 --> 00:28:30.820
King is still king in my I'm an unabashed,
not disciple that's wrong word especially

00:28:30.820 --> 00:28:32.050
in this context but
[laughter]

00:28:32.050 --> 00:28:34.750
&gt;&gt;Seth Grahame-Smith: but King lover.

00:28:34.750 --> 00:28:40.290
Unapologetically to this day and I just read
everything that I get my hands on of King.

00:28:40.290 --> 00:28:46.010
One of the ones that really stuck with me
early on was Skeleton Crew and It those were

00:28:46.010 --> 00:28:50.670
big in the eighties for me another one though
real one that got under my skin in a big way

00:28:50.670 --> 00:28:54.480
that I think about all the time was Something
Wicked this Way Comes.

00:28:54.480 --> 00:29:01.690
Which was Ray Bradbury's the story of the
traveling carnival.

00:29:01.690 --> 00:29:06.400
Mr. Dark coming to town and it was really
a great it's a book about boys aspiring to

00:29:06.400 --> 00:29:12.710
be men and men aspiring to be boys and a story
about regret and small towns it's just a beautifully

00:29:12.710 --> 00:29:20.020
written story so I tend to judge myself and
everything against King and those guys that

00:29:20.020 --> 00:29:22.560
sort of cannon of genre authors.

00:29:22.560 --> 00:29:24.450
Okay one last in the back.

00:29:24.450 --> 00:29:25.450
Yes?

00:29:25.450 --> 00:29:30.050
&gt;&gt;man 3: When you did your research did you
need to consult to any religious scholars,

00:29:30.050 --> 00:29:31.560
theologians or anyone like that?

00:29:31.560 --> 00:29:39.370
&gt;&gt;Seth Grahame-Smith: Yeah it's interesting
I didn't consult with I would say people of

00:29:39.370 --> 00:29:45.230
deep faith let's say during the writing of
the book but after I had written the manuscript

00:29:45.230 --> 00:29:51.950
I had several people of different faiths and
of devout faith that had no connection to

00:29:51.950 --> 00:29:57.230
me directly read the book and sort of give
feedback about it.

00:29:57.230 --> 00:30:04.190
And honestly the person this was another encouraging
thing about my impending assassination but

00:30:04.190 --> 00:30:09.020
[laughter]
&gt;&gt;Seth Grahame-Smith: Was that one of the

00:30:09.020 --> 00:30:14.800
more self-proclaimed evangelistic deeply devout
Christians really loved the book and I got

00:30:14.800 --> 00:30:21.770
a long letter back from her about, how it
had been handled delicately and about how

00:30:21.770 --> 00:30:23.850
so that was really encouraging to know.

00:30:23.850 --> 00:30:29.860
So, well thank you guys for taking time and
it's great it's honestly it's really cool

00:30:29.860 --> 00:30:34.710
to be here and I'm huge fan of what you guys
are doing so thank you and thanks for coming

00:30:34.710 --> 00:30:36.290
to hear me yap thanks.

00:30:36.290 --> 00:30:36.500
[applause]
