00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.240
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:00:03.865 --> 00:00:04.490
SPEAKER 1: Yep.

00:00:04.490 --> 00:00:07.910
That's me on a pig
hunt in Hawaii.

00:00:07.910 --> 00:00:09.925
But this isn't
exactly how it looks.

00:00:09.925 --> 00:00:11.400
SPEAKER 2: Pig right there.

00:00:11.400 --> 00:00:15.410
SPEAKER 1: I'm actually doing
this to save coral reefs.

00:00:15.410 --> 00:00:16.990
Let me explain.

00:00:16.990 --> 00:00:18.800
I came to the Big
Island of Hawaii

00:00:18.800 --> 00:00:22.990
to understand how feral pigs
along with climate change

00:00:22.990 --> 00:00:25.350
are contributing to the
destruction of coral reefs

00:00:25.350 --> 00:00:28.350
here.

00:00:28.350 --> 00:00:30.723
[INAUDIBLE]

00:00:33.605 --> 00:00:34.980
CHAD WIGGINS:
What's happening is

00:00:34.980 --> 00:00:37.150
the pigs are up
Mauka in the forest,

00:00:37.150 --> 00:00:39.890
and they're foraging up there
for worms and for snails.

00:00:39.890 --> 00:00:42.230
And so they dig up the soil.

00:00:42.230 --> 00:00:44.256
Once the rains come,
intermittently, and flood

00:00:44.256 --> 00:00:46.630
these streams, that's when we
get a big pulse of sediment

00:00:46.630 --> 00:00:48.119
out onto the reed.

00:00:48.119 --> 00:00:49.660
As soon as sediment
covers the coral,

00:00:49.660 --> 00:00:50.822
the coral typically dies.

00:00:50.822 --> 00:00:52.530
If it's smothered, it
can't get sunlight.

00:00:52.530 --> 00:00:55.130
It can't get oxygen. It can't
get nutrients and it's dead.

00:00:55.130 --> 00:00:57.979
If the coral manages to survive,
every time the waves comes,

00:00:57.979 --> 00:00:59.520
it gets re-suspended
and the sediment

00:00:59.520 --> 00:01:03.136
continues to do damage,
sometimes for decades.

00:01:03.136 --> 00:01:05.260
KYLE THIERMANN: Last year,
the Big Island of Hawaii

00:01:05.260 --> 00:01:06.930
experienced the
largest coral bleaching

00:01:06.930 --> 00:01:08.700
event in recorded history.

00:01:08.700 --> 00:01:10.660
Right now, I'm on a
boat with scientists

00:01:10.660 --> 00:01:13.080
from the division of
aquatic resources and NOAA

00:01:13.080 --> 00:01:14.780
to survey the current
state of coral.

00:01:17.330 --> 00:01:20.550
Even to my untrained eye,
I can see that the decaying

00:01:20.550 --> 00:01:22.780
coral had lost their vibrancy.

00:01:22.780 --> 00:01:26.060
And there were
significantly fewer fish.

00:01:26.060 --> 00:01:31.700
LINDSEY KRAMER: To actually
see these huge multi hundred

00:01:31.700 --> 00:01:34.440
or many hundreds of
year old colonies

00:01:34.440 --> 00:01:38.070
completely bleached and stressed
and with that good chance

00:01:38.070 --> 00:01:39.890
that they weren't
going to survive,

00:01:39.890 --> 00:01:42.080
it was really devastating.

00:01:42.080 --> 00:01:44.230
Really awful to see.

00:01:44.230 --> 00:01:46.100
And I think, that
was the first time,

00:01:46.100 --> 00:01:49.420
for me, that the magnitude
of this was obvious.

00:01:49.420 --> 00:01:54.110
That we might not see
recovery from this event

00:01:54.110 --> 00:01:54.845
in our lifetimes.

00:02:00.210 --> 00:02:03.730
DR. JAMIE GOVE: Coral reefs
are important for a number

00:02:03.730 --> 00:02:05.290
of reasons.

00:02:05.290 --> 00:02:10.030
There's no other ecosystem
on this planet that

00:02:10.030 --> 00:02:14.030
occupies such a
small geographic area

00:02:14.030 --> 00:02:17.450
but it has more forms of life
than coral reef ecosystems.

00:02:17.450 --> 00:02:19.780
There are unprecedented.

00:02:19.780 --> 00:02:22.720
One in four of all
marine organisms

00:02:22.720 --> 00:02:24.580
live in association
with coral reefs

00:02:24.580 --> 00:02:28.130
but they occupy less than
1/10 of 1% of the sea floor.

00:02:28.130 --> 00:02:30.790
SPEAKER 1: This is Dr. Jamie
Gove, a research oceanographer

00:02:30.790 --> 00:02:33.940
for the National Oceanic and
Atmospheric Administration.

00:02:33.940 --> 00:02:35.399
He also lets me
sleep on his couch.

00:02:35.399 --> 00:02:37.023
DR. JAMIE GOVE: So
without coral reefs,

00:02:37.023 --> 00:02:38.800
all of those waves and
storms and currents

00:02:38.800 --> 00:02:40.840
would reach shore
and wreak havoc

00:02:40.840 --> 00:02:43.730
on all of the shoreline
property that we saw today,

00:02:43.730 --> 00:02:44.750
among other things.

00:02:47.577 --> 00:02:49.410
SPEAKER 1: Since feral
pigs are contributing

00:02:49.410 --> 00:02:52.580
to the damage we saw underwater,
I met up with Chad back

00:02:52.580 --> 00:02:54.980
on dry land to
see how fencing is

00:02:54.980 --> 00:02:56.461
helping to control the problem.

00:02:56.461 --> 00:02:58.960
CHAD WIGGINS: Once a fence is
constructed in a priority area

00:02:58.960 --> 00:03:01.650
where you want to conserve
the forest or retain sediment,

00:03:01.650 --> 00:03:03.665
hunters can come in and
reduce the populations.

00:03:03.665 --> 00:03:05.040
SPEAKER 1: It's
important to note

00:03:05.040 --> 00:03:08.250
that the eradication of feral
pigs is not the goal here.

00:03:08.250 --> 00:03:11.690
In fact, pigs are extremely
significant to the islands.

00:03:11.690 --> 00:03:13.860
Historically and culturally.

00:03:13.860 --> 00:03:15.990
CHAD WIGGINS: When pigs
and goats were dropped off

00:03:15.990 --> 00:03:19.790
by Captain Cook in 1778,
they found paradise here.

00:03:19.790 --> 00:03:22.137
Domestic pig bread
with the Polynesian pig

00:03:22.137 --> 00:03:24.220
which was already here at
the time of the arrival.

00:03:24.220 --> 00:03:27.030
The facts that pigs were here
when Captain Cook arrived,

00:03:27.030 --> 00:03:28.630
means that the
Polynesians valued

00:03:28.630 --> 00:03:30.830
them enough to bring them
across the ocean to Hawaii

00:03:30.830 --> 00:03:31.960
and cultivate them.

00:03:31.960 --> 00:03:35.300
SPEAKER 1: And pigs are still
highly valued by locals here.

00:03:35.300 --> 00:03:39.100
The problem is, their
population has exploded.

00:03:39.100 --> 00:03:42.620
You would have to remove 70%
of the current pig population

00:03:42.620 --> 00:03:44.970
each year to keep
them under control,

00:03:44.970 --> 00:03:48.500
which is why people like Justin
Lee and Wayne [? Cypriano ?]

00:03:48.500 --> 00:03:50.840
are still hunting pigs.

00:03:50.840 --> 00:03:53.620
JUSTIN LEE: Without
hunters, without people

00:03:53.620 --> 00:03:55.790
regulating the
numbers, Hawaii as we

00:03:55.790 --> 00:03:57.970
know it will never be the same.

00:03:57.970 --> 00:04:00.110
All of the useful
meat from this animal

00:04:00.110 --> 00:04:04.620
is going to be made into
appetizers at a baby first luau

00:04:04.620 --> 00:04:05.942
or a wedding.

00:04:05.942 --> 00:04:08.150
It will be food on the table,
not just for our family

00:04:08.150 --> 00:04:10.480
but for a lot of
different families.

00:04:10.480 --> 00:04:12.340
SPEAKER 1: And Justin
makes a good argument,

00:04:12.340 --> 00:04:14.550
which is why I found
myself on this hunt.

00:04:14.550 --> 00:04:17.860
Climate change is endangering
coral reefs all over the world.

00:04:17.860 --> 00:04:20.550
And our ability to deal
with land based intox,

00:04:20.550 --> 00:04:23.300
like feral pig, could
make the difference

00:04:23.300 --> 00:04:26.850
in the survival of these reefs.

00:04:26.850 --> 00:04:29.270
Are you aware of other
invasive species impacting

00:04:29.270 --> 00:04:30.780
the environment where you live?

00:04:30.780 --> 00:04:32.410
Let us know in the
comments below.

00:04:32.410 --> 00:04:35.750
And check out this next episode
on another island in Hawaii

00:04:35.750 --> 00:04:39.140
where one company is growing
algae to power airplanes

00:04:39.140 --> 00:04:39.754
and more.

00:04:39.754 --> 00:04:41.670
SPEAKER 3: So this is
the dried algae product.

00:04:41.670 --> 00:04:44.120
After we dry it, we
grind up into powder.

00:04:44.120 --> 00:04:46.450
And then we extract
the oil out of it.

00:04:46.450 --> 00:04:49.610
That oil is then refined
into diesel fuel or jet fuel.

00:04:49.610 --> 00:04:52.210
The fuel that we're
producing is exactly the same

00:04:52.210 --> 00:04:55.640
in terms of performance as
gasoline or diesel or jet.

00:04:55.640 --> 00:04:56.797
It's just a lot cleaner.

00:04:56.797 --> 00:04:58.630
