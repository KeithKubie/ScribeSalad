00:00:23.377 --> 00:00:25.210
PROFESSOR: OK, so let
me just quickly remind

00:00:25.210 --> 00:00:28.120
you of what we've done
what we did last time.

00:00:28.120 --> 00:00:31.931
So unfortunately, today is going
to be a little bit of what I

00:00:31.931 --> 00:00:34.430
wanted to do this time and a
little bit of what I would have

00:00:34.430 --> 00:00:36.050
wanted to have been done
in recitation yesterday,

00:00:36.050 --> 00:00:37.980
because all recitations
were cancelled.

00:00:37.980 --> 00:00:41.900
So today is going to include
a few steps along the way

00:00:41.900 --> 00:00:44.010
that I skipped over last time.

00:00:44.010 --> 00:00:46.157
OK, so to review
from last time, we

00:00:46.157 --> 00:00:47.490
talked about central potentials.

00:00:47.490 --> 00:00:50.110
The energy operator had a radial
derivative term, an angular

00:00:50.110 --> 00:00:51.822
momentum term, and
a potential term.

00:00:51.822 --> 00:00:54.280
So this would be true regardless
of whether we were central

00:00:54.280 --> 00:00:54.880
or not.

00:00:54.880 --> 00:00:57.004
But if we have a central
potential, where this only

00:00:57.004 --> 00:00:59.890
depends on the magnitude
of the radius vector,

00:00:59.890 --> 00:01:01.970
then we can use
separation of variables,

00:01:01.970 --> 00:01:05.560
and write an energy eigenstate
as a radial part-- which

00:01:05.560 --> 00:01:09.300
we will sneakily pull out a
factor of 1 over the radius--

00:01:09.300 --> 00:01:12.350
as we saw last time, that
was particularly convenient.

00:01:12.350 --> 00:01:15.870
It took care of this r and made
everything nice and simple.

00:01:15.870 --> 00:01:19.102
So a radial part times
a spherical harmonic.

00:01:19.102 --> 00:01:20.810
The reason we use a
spherical harmonic is

00:01:20.810 --> 00:01:23.940
that neither of these two
terms depend on the angular

00:01:23.940 --> 00:01:24.610
coordinates.

00:01:24.610 --> 00:01:27.240
The angular momentum, we know
what its eigenfunctions are,

00:01:27.240 --> 00:01:28.656
so if we use a
spherical harmonic,

00:01:28.656 --> 00:01:32.060
this angular momentum
becomes just a constant.

00:01:32.060 --> 00:01:34.320
And having separated
in this form,

00:01:34.320 --> 00:01:37.110
and pulling out that
sneaky factor of 1 over r,

00:01:37.110 --> 00:01:41.100
the energy eigenvalue equation
reduces to a simple 1-D

00:01:41.100 --> 00:01:44.560
effective energy
eigenvalue equation

00:01:44.560 --> 00:01:49.060
with a simple dr squared,
and an effective potential,

00:01:49.060 --> 00:01:53.490
where the effective potential is
the original central potential

00:01:53.490 --> 00:01:55.320
plus an angular
momentum term, often

00:01:55.320 --> 00:01:59.870
referred to the angular
momentum barrier-- which

00:01:59.870 --> 00:02:03.400
is proportional
to-- as Matt says,

00:02:03.400 --> 00:02:06.800
as Professor Evans
says, in 804, one

00:02:06.800 --> 00:02:09.680
is forced to say h bar
squared upon 2m repeatedly.

00:02:09.680 --> 00:02:12.180
And he pointed out that it would
be much more efficient if I

00:02:12.180 --> 00:02:14.620
would just come up with a
simple variable for saying it

00:02:14.620 --> 00:02:15.750
or sound.

00:02:15.750 --> 00:02:19.188
So I will attempt to
henceforth call it pfft.

00:02:19.188 --> 00:02:20.650
[LAUGHTER]

00:02:20.650 --> 00:02:23.000
So the effective
potential is pfft,

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:26.410
l, l plus 1 upon r squared
plus the central part

00:02:26.410 --> 00:02:29.870
of the potential-- props
to Professor Evans.

00:02:29.870 --> 00:02:32.160
And this is true in general
for central potential.

00:02:32.160 --> 00:02:35.330
The last thing we notice of
this is that since the energy

00:02:35.330 --> 00:02:37.920
eigenvalue equation has been
reduced to this form, which

00:02:37.920 --> 00:02:40.120
depends on l, but is
independent of m-- m

00:02:40.120 --> 00:02:43.020
appears nowhere here--
the energy can't possibly

00:02:43.020 --> 00:02:52.360
depend on m, although
it can depend on l.

00:02:52.360 --> 00:02:53.500
It's just e of l.

00:02:53.500 --> 00:02:55.420
And thus, for every
different value of m,

00:02:55.420 --> 00:02:59.410
I will get the same energy--
fixed l, different m.

00:02:59.410 --> 00:03:03.390
And there are how many
values of m for a fixed l?

00:03:03.390 --> 00:03:04.110
2l plus 1.

00:03:04.110 --> 00:03:15.110
So the degeneracy
of El is 2l plus 1.

00:03:15.110 --> 00:03:15.610
Right?

00:03:15.610 --> 00:03:17.290
That's general for
any central potential.

00:03:17.290 --> 00:03:18.790
It only requires
spherical symmetry.

00:03:22.990 --> 00:03:26.020
So then we say the example of
the cooling potential, where

00:03:26.020 --> 00:03:27.920
the potential is minus
E squared upon r.

00:03:30.670 --> 00:03:33.465
And we solved-- or I quickly
reviewed the solution

00:03:33.465 --> 00:03:39.710
of the energy
eigenvalue equation.

00:03:39.710 --> 00:03:42.870
I'll write it that
way-- where r of what

00:03:42.870 --> 00:03:46.440
I will call-- in place of
E I, will simply write n.

00:03:46.440 --> 00:03:56.240
Rnl is equal to e to
the minus r over 2

00:03:56.240 --> 00:04:09.300
r naught n times r over r
naught to the l plus 1 times

00:04:09.300 --> 00:04:18.200
some simple function v sub
n of l of r over r naught,

00:04:18.200 --> 00:04:24.920
with the energy nlm
being equal to E naught--

00:04:24.920 --> 00:04:27.730
or I should say e Rydberg in
our notation of last time--

00:04:27.730 --> 00:04:30.750
upon n squared
minus bound state.

00:04:30.750 --> 00:04:33.100
So let's talk
about this quickly.

00:04:33.100 --> 00:04:37.560
This term-- the fact that it
goes exponentially-- falls

00:04:37.560 --> 00:04:39.850
exponentially at
large distances--

00:04:39.850 --> 00:04:46.359
came from the asymptotic
analysis at r goes to infinity.

00:04:46.359 --> 00:04:48.150
And this is just saying
it's a bound state.

00:04:48.150 --> 00:04:50.410
The probability density
falls off exponentially

00:04:50.410 --> 00:04:53.050
as we get to large radius.

00:04:53.050 --> 00:04:59.470
This term came from
the asymptotic analysis

00:04:59.470 --> 00:05:01.180
near r goes to zero.

00:05:01.180 --> 00:05:03.620
And near r goes to
zero, the only term

00:05:03.620 --> 00:05:07.850
that matters is in the
effective-- this is one upon r.

00:05:07.850 --> 00:05:10.920
This is 1 over r squared, so
this gets large more rapidly.

00:05:10.920 --> 00:05:13.110
This term is important,
and that l, l plus 1

00:05:13.110 --> 00:05:15.660
gave us r to the l plus 1.

00:05:15.660 --> 00:05:18.080
We work in dimensionless
variables, rho.

00:05:18.080 --> 00:05:20.270
And here, I replace rho
with r over r naught,

00:05:20.270 --> 00:05:22.061
where r naught was the
characteristic scale

00:05:22.061 --> 00:05:23.640
we computed last time.

00:05:23.640 --> 00:05:26.650
And finally, this
function V sub nl

00:05:26.650 --> 00:05:31.710
satisfied-- it again satisfied
the energy eigenvalue equation,

00:05:31.710 --> 00:05:33.500
but having pulled
out these factors

00:05:33.500 --> 00:05:36.130
such that asymptotically,
its regular.

00:05:36.130 --> 00:05:38.820
So this function
must be regular,

00:05:38.820 --> 00:05:41.890
smooth-- no
divergences, no poles--

00:05:41.890 --> 00:05:46.610
as r goes to infinity and to 0.

00:05:46.610 --> 00:05:47.250
OK.

00:05:47.250 --> 00:05:50.380
And then we solved this
by series expansion.

00:05:50.380 --> 00:05:52.340
And from termination of
the series expansion,

00:05:52.340 --> 00:05:54.310
we got that the energy--
we got a relationship

00:05:54.310 --> 00:05:56.100
between the energy
and l and n, and

00:05:56.100 --> 00:05:58.240
in particular the
relationship-- this

00:05:58.240 --> 00:06:04.000
came from termination
of the series, just

00:06:04.000 --> 00:06:05.985
like it did for the
harmonic oscillator.

00:06:08.870 --> 00:06:10.300
And the termination
series gave us

00:06:10.300 --> 00:06:12.721
that the energy was equal
to minus a constant over n

00:06:12.721 --> 00:06:13.220
squared.

00:06:17.610 --> 00:06:19.580
With one additional
condition, which

00:06:19.580 --> 00:06:22.800
is that n had to
be greater than l.

00:06:22.800 --> 00:06:24.849
n had to be an integer
greater than l.

00:06:24.849 --> 00:06:27.140
And l, of course, has to be
greater than or equal to 0.

00:06:32.580 --> 00:06:35.250
So let me just
quickly tell you how

00:06:35.250 --> 00:06:38.840
this arises, because this is an
important fact about hydrogen

00:06:38.840 --> 00:06:41.860
which I want you to understand.

00:06:41.860 --> 00:06:45.430
So the way that arises is we
got the energy from a series

00:06:45.430 --> 00:06:50.096
expansion for this remaining
function of rv and l of r.

00:06:50.096 --> 00:06:51.900
And that series
expansion started out

00:06:51.900 --> 00:07:00.020
by saying let v be of the
form sum over j of a sub j, r

00:07:00.020 --> 00:07:05.235
over r naught, the dimensionless
variable rho, to the j,

00:07:05.235 --> 00:07:07.660
to the j-th power, so
it's a power series.

00:07:07.660 --> 00:07:09.890
And when we plug this
whole form, together

00:07:09.890 --> 00:07:12.660
with this series expansion,
into that differential equation,

00:07:12.660 --> 00:07:16.460
we get-- just like we did before
for a harmonic oscillator--

00:07:16.460 --> 00:07:18.870
we get a set of
relations between

00:07:18.870 --> 00:07:21.120
the various coefficients
in that series.

00:07:21.120 --> 00:07:24.240
And we solve that by
saying a sub j plus 1--

00:07:24.240 --> 00:07:26.530
by deriving a recursion
relation-- is equal to a sub

00:07:26.530 --> 00:07:34.350
j times 2, square
root of epsilon times

00:07:34.350 --> 00:07:53.930
j plus l plus 1 minus 1 upon
j plus 1, j plus 2l plus 2.

00:07:58.210 --> 00:07:58.860
OK, fine.

00:07:58.860 --> 00:08:00.151
We get this recursion relation.

00:08:00.151 --> 00:08:02.410
It looks absolutely
awful, but it tells you

00:08:02.410 --> 00:08:07.010
that if you know a0, say, is
a constant which is not 0--

00:08:07.010 --> 00:08:08.635
if it's zero, then
they're all 0-- then

00:08:08.635 --> 00:08:11.170
this function is identically
0, because a j plus 1

00:08:11.170 --> 00:08:12.940
is a j times some constant.

00:08:12.940 --> 00:08:15.321
So this had better
not vanish-- a sub 0.

00:08:15.321 --> 00:08:16.820
So the first term,
the constant term

00:08:16.820 --> 00:08:18.774
doesn't vanish, which is good.

00:08:18.774 --> 00:08:20.690
It tells us V doesn't
vanish, so we've already

00:08:20.690 --> 00:08:21.439
learned something.

00:08:21.439 --> 00:08:25.250
If V doesn't vanish
identically at the origin,

00:08:25.250 --> 00:08:29.085
then we can determine a1 from
a0 by multiplying by this.

00:08:29.085 --> 00:08:32.030
j is 0 in this, and
l is whatever number

00:08:32.030 --> 00:08:33.919
we fix from ylm.

00:08:33.919 --> 00:08:34.460
And so on.

00:08:34.460 --> 00:08:35.799
We can deduce all
the higher a sub l's.

00:08:35.799 --> 00:08:37.000
It's a series expansion.

00:08:37.000 --> 00:08:40.260
This is the recursion
relation for it.

00:08:40.260 --> 00:08:44.920
However, note the following
thing-- as j gets large,

00:08:44.920 --> 00:08:49.690
so we go to higher and
higher orders in the series,

00:08:49.690 --> 00:08:53.100
then j is much larger than
whatever fixed number l is,

00:08:53.100 --> 00:08:55.410
and much larger than
whatever fixed number 2 is.

00:08:55.410 --> 00:09:01.610
So this asymptotes to aj times
roughly 2 epsilon j upon j

00:09:01.610 --> 00:09:03.410
plus 1 j.

00:09:03.410 --> 00:09:06.915
At very large j, this just
goes to 2 epsilon over j.

00:09:06.915 --> 00:09:08.540
Now, let's think
about what that means.

00:09:08.540 --> 00:09:11.530
If I have that aj plus
1 is roughly equal

00:09:11.530 --> 00:09:18.720
to aj times root epsilon
times 2 over j plus 1,

00:09:18.720 --> 00:09:24.900
I guess, then this tells me
that every time I increase j,

00:09:24.900 --> 00:09:28.120
I get a factor of j plus 1
and another factor of 2 root

00:09:28.120 --> 00:09:28.810
epsilon.

00:09:28.810 --> 00:09:33.450
This tells me that a sub j
is equal to a sub 0 times

00:09:33.450 --> 00:09:40.174
2 root epsilon to the
j over j factorial.

00:09:40.174 --> 00:09:41.840
But those are the
expansion coefficients

00:09:41.840 --> 00:09:48.230
of an exponential-- quantity
to the n over n factorial.

00:09:48.230 --> 00:09:51.080
But that's bad, because
if this series is

00:09:51.080 --> 00:09:55.220
the exponential series with
argument 2 root epsilon,

00:09:55.220 --> 00:10:03.840
then this series becomes E to
the 2 root epsilon r over r0.

00:10:03.840 --> 00:10:08.090
But that's bad, because that
would exactly swamp this term.

00:10:08.090 --> 00:10:09.810
That would defeat the
asymptotic analysis

00:10:09.810 --> 00:10:10.810
we did at the beginning.

00:10:10.810 --> 00:10:13.980
If this term, V, is
growing so large twice

00:10:13.980 --> 00:10:17.310
as rapidly as this
is going to 0,

00:10:17.310 --> 00:10:19.470
then the net is
diverging at infinity.

00:10:19.470 --> 00:10:20.820
That's bad.

00:10:20.820 --> 00:10:23.790
So in order for this--
for the series expansion--

00:10:23.790 --> 00:10:27.330
to describe a good function that
really does vanish at infinity,

00:10:27.330 --> 00:10:30.150
we need that this
doesn't happen.

00:10:30.150 --> 00:10:31.750
So it must be true
that j doesn't

00:10:31.750 --> 00:10:35.350
get large enough that
the exponential in V

00:10:35.350 --> 00:10:37.800
overwhelms the
decaying exponential

00:10:37.800 --> 00:10:39.240
from the asymptotic analysis.

00:10:39.240 --> 00:10:40.450
Everyone cool with that?

00:10:40.450 --> 00:10:42.044
So it has to terminate.

00:10:42.044 --> 00:10:44.460
But if it terminates-- let's
look at the coefficient here.

00:10:44.460 --> 00:10:51.210
If it terminates, this says that
2 root epsilon times j plus--

00:10:51.210 --> 00:10:53.810
and if it terminates, that says
that there's some j maximum.

00:10:56.437 --> 00:10:57.770
Well, let me write it over here.

00:10:57.770 --> 00:10:59.270
If it terminates,
that means there's

00:10:59.270 --> 00:11:02.850
some value j such
that aj plus 1 is 0.

00:11:02.850 --> 00:11:05.830
But if aj plus 1 is zero,
how can that possibly be?

00:11:05.830 --> 00:11:08.180
It must be that for
that maximum value of j,

00:11:08.180 --> 00:11:10.850
the numerator
vanishes-- specifically

00:11:10.850 --> 00:11:12.900
for that maximum value of j.

00:11:12.900 --> 00:11:13.700
Yeah?

00:11:13.700 --> 00:11:15.690
Well, what's the condition
for that numerator

00:11:15.690 --> 00:11:17.390
to vanish for a
specific value of j?

00:11:17.390 --> 00:11:21.360
I'll j sub m, or j
max, the maximum value,

00:11:21.360 --> 00:11:25.470
such that a sub j
max plus 1 vanishes.

00:11:25.470 --> 00:11:30.080
So j plus l plus 1
must be equal to 1.

00:11:30.080 --> 00:11:33.300
Or said differently,
epsilon-- which

00:11:33.300 --> 00:11:37.060
is the energy in units
of e0, must be equal to 1

00:11:37.060 --> 00:11:45.080
over 4 g max plus l plus
1, quantity squared.

00:11:45.080 --> 00:11:46.510
Cool?

00:11:46.510 --> 00:11:50.070
So that means that our
solutions, or states psi,

00:11:50.070 --> 00:11:52.700
are now labeled
by three integers.

00:11:52.700 --> 00:11:56.440
they're labeled by l And by
m from spherical harmonics,

00:11:56.440 --> 00:11:58.440
but they're also labeled
by the value j max.

00:12:02.710 --> 00:12:07.452
And j max can be any number
from 0 to infinity, right?

00:12:07.452 --> 00:12:08.910
Strictly, it
shouldn't be infinite,

00:12:08.910 --> 00:12:12.930
but any finite number, any
countable, any integer--

00:12:12.930 --> 00:12:16.570
because eventually the
series terminates at j max.

00:12:16.570 --> 00:12:18.230
So it's labeled by
these three numbers,

00:12:18.230 --> 00:12:28.680
and the energy of lmj max
is equal to e0 minus over 4.

00:12:28.680 --> 00:12:32.520
And this e0 over 4 we already
saw was e Rydberg, 13.6 dv,

00:12:32.520 --> 00:12:33.680
times what value?

00:12:33.680 --> 00:12:39.722
Well, here's the energy in
units of e0-- jm plus l plus 1,

00:12:39.722 --> 00:12:40.430
quantity squared.

00:12:43.890 --> 00:12:46.650
Where L is greater
than or equal to 0,

00:12:46.650 --> 00:12:51.090
j sub m is greater than
or equal to 0, and 1 is 1.

00:12:51.090 --> 00:12:52.990
But this is sort of cumbersome.

00:12:52.990 --> 00:12:56.620
We can just as well
call this quantity n,

00:12:56.620 --> 00:12:59.370
where n is greater
than l as an integer.

00:12:59.370 --> 00:13:01.210
It can't be equal
to l, but it could

00:13:01.210 --> 00:13:03.900
be 1 greater than l,
or any greater integer.

00:13:03.900 --> 00:13:04.930
Is that cool?

00:13:04.930 --> 00:13:07.420
So instead of labeling
it by jm, the point

00:13:07.420 --> 00:13:11.370
at which the series terminates,
we'll label it by n,

00:13:11.370 --> 00:13:15.230
and you can deduce what jm is
by subtracting I plus 1 from n.

00:13:15.230 --> 00:13:17.200
That tells you where
the series terminates.

00:13:17.200 --> 00:13:19.510
Notice that this tells
you something nice.

00:13:19.510 --> 00:13:25.640
This power series for V,
if n is equal to l plus 1,

00:13:25.640 --> 00:13:26.850
has how many terms in it?

00:13:29.389 --> 00:13:31.430
So say it out loud, just
think about it a second.

00:13:31.430 --> 00:13:35.834
If n is equal to l
plus 1, how many terms

00:13:35.834 --> 00:13:37.750
are there, that are
non-vanishing in the power

00:13:37.750 --> 00:13:38.250
series?

00:13:40.874 --> 00:13:42.540
I won't call on you,
but raise your hand

00:13:42.540 --> 00:13:43.540
when you have an answer.

00:13:50.690 --> 00:13:55.480
What's the value of j max
if n is equal to l plus 1?

00:13:55.480 --> 00:13:58.060
So what term is the first
one to vanish in the series?

00:14:01.254 --> 00:14:02.920
OK, so how many terms
are non-vanishing?

00:14:05.540 --> 00:14:07.560
Yeah, just the one--
just the first term.

00:14:07.560 --> 00:14:11.320
So when l is as large
as it can possibly

00:14:11.320 --> 00:14:18.480
be-- when l is equal to n minus
1, V is a constant function.

00:14:18.480 --> 00:14:20.451
It's just constant.

00:14:20.451 --> 00:14:27.340
When l is one less, when l is
n minus 1, or n is l plus 2,

00:14:27.340 --> 00:14:31.559
then V has two terms in it--
a constant, and a linear.

00:14:31.559 --> 00:14:33.475
So the greater the
difference between l and n,

00:14:33.475 --> 00:14:37.140
the more terms there
are in the series.

00:14:37.140 --> 00:14:39.380
OK?

00:14:39.380 --> 00:14:44.360
So anyway, this leads to
this form of the energy.

00:14:44.360 --> 00:14:48.720
But as is usually the case, this
sort of a brute force analysis

00:14:48.720 --> 00:14:50.570
doesn't give us a
whole lot of insight

00:14:50.570 --> 00:14:53.770
into why we get the
qualitative features we do.

00:14:53.770 --> 00:14:55.990
In particular, the
qualitative feature

00:14:55.990 --> 00:14:58.870
that stands out most obviously
to me-- I don't know about you

00:14:58.870 --> 00:15:02.830
guys-- is the fact that
the degeneracy is now much,

00:15:02.830 --> 00:15:03.980
much larger.

00:15:03.980 --> 00:15:07.200
In particular, we know
from basic principles

00:15:07.200 --> 00:15:09.220
of a central potential--
as we just reviewed--

00:15:09.220 --> 00:15:12.980
that anytime a potential
is symmetrically invariant,

00:15:12.980 --> 00:15:16.930
is spherically
symmetric-- any time

00:15:16.930 --> 00:15:20.390
the potential is spherically
symmetric, rotationally

00:15:20.390 --> 00:15:22.720
invariant-- then there
must be degeneracy

00:15:22.720 --> 00:15:26.400
of 2l plus 1 for every energy
eigenstate-- there must be.

00:15:26.400 --> 00:15:29.420
The l could be zero, but if
there's any angular momentum,

00:15:29.420 --> 00:15:31.750
then that degeneracy
must be 2l plus 1.

00:15:31.750 --> 00:15:33.315
But this is much
more degenerate.

00:15:37.200 --> 00:15:39.480
And in fact, how
degenerate is it?

00:15:39.480 --> 00:15:45.430
Well, for any given
En, the degeneracy

00:15:45.430 --> 00:15:50.210
is equal to-- well, what are
the possible values of l?

00:15:50.210 --> 00:15:54.390
So we have some state for
every different value of l.

00:15:54.390 --> 00:15:58.580
l could be equal to 0, and it
can go up to n minus 1, right?

00:15:58.580 --> 00:16:07.290
Because, again,
n is some integer

00:16:07.290 --> 00:16:09.640
which could vanish, l plus 1.

00:16:09.640 --> 00:16:12.360
So as small as this can be is 0.

00:16:12.360 --> 00:16:14.520
So n can be l plus 1,
or anything greater.

00:16:14.520 --> 00:16:20.300
I.e.: l can go up to n minus
1, but it can't be any greater.

00:16:20.300 --> 00:16:24.806
Then for every value of
l, there is a state n--

00:16:24.806 --> 00:16:27.222
there's a value of n which
could be minus l all the way up

00:16:27.222 --> 00:16:28.202
to l in integer steps.

00:16:28.202 --> 00:16:29.410
So how many states are there?

00:16:29.410 --> 00:16:32.830
Well there's one state for
every value of n, l, and m.

00:16:32.830 --> 00:16:34.490
So it's this sum.

00:16:34.490 --> 00:16:37.140
The sum on m for minus
l to l is 2l plus 1.

00:16:37.140 --> 00:16:43.240
So this is the sum n minus
1, l equals 0, of 2l plus 1.

00:16:43.240 --> 00:16:45.600
And this is equal to,
kind of beautifully, n

00:16:45.600 --> 00:16:52.150
squared-- just
arithmetic series.

00:16:52.150 --> 00:16:57.440
So we have this huge
degeneracy, which

00:16:57.440 --> 00:17:00.340
is much larger than 2l plus 1.

00:17:00.340 --> 00:17:03.910
It's the sum over 2l plus
1 from l to 0 to n minus 1.

00:17:03.910 --> 00:17:05.615
Where is this
degeneracy coming from?

00:17:05.615 --> 00:17:06.115
Why?

00:17:11.220 --> 00:17:16.160
So quantum mechanically,
we know the following--

00:17:16.160 --> 00:17:17.880
we've learned the
following-- and I

00:17:17.880 --> 00:17:20.940
hope it's under your
fingernails at this point--

00:17:20.940 --> 00:17:22.890
that when you see
a degeneracy, you

00:17:22.890 --> 00:17:26.619
should expect that degeneracy
to follow from some symmetry.

00:17:26.619 --> 00:17:28.980
There's some symmetry
of the system that

00:17:28.980 --> 00:17:31.160
is leading to a degeneracy
by virtue of the fact

00:17:31.160 --> 00:17:33.285
that the generators of that
symmetry-- for example,

00:17:33.285 --> 00:17:34.970
for rotation it's
angular momentum--

00:17:34.970 --> 00:17:36.380
commute with the energy.

00:17:36.380 --> 00:17:38.860
And when you have an operator
that commutes with the energy

00:17:38.860 --> 00:17:41.350
operator, as we've
seen, you can generally

00:17:41.350 --> 00:17:44.300
construct new states given
a single energy eigenstate

00:17:44.300 --> 00:17:48.230
by acting suitably
with that operator.

00:17:48.230 --> 00:17:54.814
So we should expect there
to be some new symmetry.

00:17:54.814 --> 00:17:56.480
But it's very hard
to see what symmetry.

00:17:56.480 --> 00:17:58.287
I mean, this is hydrogen.

00:17:58.287 --> 00:17:59.370
This is central potential.

00:17:59.370 --> 00:18:01.100
It's just some stupid
central potential.

00:18:01.100 --> 00:18:03.300
What's so special about
the hydrogen system as

00:18:03.300 --> 00:18:05.650
opposed to, for example,
the harmonic oscillator?

00:18:05.650 --> 00:18:08.830
Which hopefully you will see
in recitation at some point.

00:18:08.830 --> 00:18:11.360
The harmonic oscillator
in three dimensions

00:18:11.360 --> 00:18:13.590
has degeneracy 2l plus 1.

00:18:13.590 --> 00:18:14.650
It's a central potential.

00:18:14.650 --> 00:18:19.320
It has to have degeneracy 2l
plus 1-- but not n squared.

00:18:19.320 --> 00:18:20.370
Where did that come from?

00:18:20.370 --> 00:18:22.290
What's so special about
the Kepler problem?

00:18:22.290 --> 00:18:23.870
So there must be some
symmetry, but it's not obvious

00:18:23.870 --> 00:18:24.640
what it is.

00:18:24.640 --> 00:18:28.415
But now let's use a note
from classical mechanics.

00:18:28.415 --> 00:18:30.540
Noether's Theorem tells us
when we have a symmetry,

00:18:30.540 --> 00:18:32.617
we have a conserved quantity.

00:18:32.617 --> 00:18:34.700
We also saw this in the
quantum mechanical version

00:18:34.700 --> 00:18:36.022
for expectation values.

00:18:36.022 --> 00:18:37.230
We have a conserved quantity.

00:18:41.632 --> 00:18:43.840
And in quantum mechanics,
having a conserved quantity

00:18:43.840 --> 00:18:47.520
means that the energy
commutes with some quantity.

00:18:50.734 --> 00:18:52.400
Because that controls
the time evolution

00:18:52.400 --> 00:18:53.441
of the expectation value.

00:18:55.739 --> 00:18:57.280
So there must be
some quantity, which

00:18:57.280 --> 00:19:00.440
I've written by a question mark,
that commutes with the energy

00:19:00.440 --> 00:19:02.290
operator, specifically
in the case

00:19:02.290 --> 00:19:04.150
of the harmonic oscillator.

00:19:04.150 --> 00:19:05.529
So what is that quantity?

00:19:05.529 --> 00:19:07.570
So actually, this quantity
in classical mechanics

00:19:07.570 --> 00:19:09.816
was studied, because
the same thing

00:19:09.816 --> 00:19:10.940
is true in the Kepler case.

00:19:10.940 --> 00:19:13.230
In the Kepler case,
the orbits close,

00:19:13.230 --> 00:19:15.006
and they have simple
ellipses, and they

00:19:15.006 --> 00:19:16.380
have all sorts of
nice properties

00:19:16.380 --> 00:19:18.869
that beg for an explanation
in terms of symmetry.

00:19:18.869 --> 00:19:21.160
And it was pointed out by a
number of people-- Laplace,

00:19:21.160 --> 00:19:23.560
Runge, Lenz, various
people-- and this is often

00:19:23.560 --> 00:19:25.020
called the Runge-Lenz
vector, but I

00:19:25.020 --> 00:19:27.630
think you can blame it
on any number of people--

00:19:27.630 --> 00:19:30.740
that there's a vector that
in classical mechanics,

00:19:30.740 --> 00:19:33.830
for the Kepler problem--
or for the Coulomb problem,

00:19:33.830 --> 00:19:35.200
is conserved.

00:19:35.200 --> 00:19:40.100
And that quantity is p cross
l-- momentum cross angular

00:19:40.100 --> 00:19:46.825
momentum-- minus m
e squared-- and let

00:19:46.825 --> 00:19:49.290
me write m sub electrons--
it's the mass rather

00:19:49.290 --> 00:19:55.800
than the quantum number little
m-- e squared, r vector.

00:19:55.800 --> 00:19:58.940
So it turns out this quantity
is classically conserved,

00:19:58.940 --> 00:20:01.280
and if you make a quantum
operator out of it,

00:20:01.280 --> 00:20:05.260
then e with A is equal to 0.

00:20:05.260 --> 00:20:07.582
Add hat.

00:20:07.582 --> 00:20:09.700
This was enormously non-obvious.

00:20:09.700 --> 00:20:12.800
If it's obvious to
you, you're a freak.

00:20:12.800 --> 00:20:14.230
It's really, really not obvious.

00:20:14.230 --> 00:20:16.310
You can go through and
do the calculation.

00:20:16.310 --> 00:20:20.320
And when I say really not
obvious, I mean-- well,

00:20:20.320 --> 00:20:22.310
I'll show you what I
mean in just a second.

00:20:22.310 --> 00:20:24.825
So you can go through and do
the calculation classically.

00:20:24.825 --> 00:20:26.880
Is this quantity conserved
in the Kepler problem

00:20:26.880 --> 00:20:27.520
using Newton's law?

00:20:27.520 --> 00:20:28.110
And the answer is yes.

00:20:28.110 --> 00:20:28.920
It's amazing.

00:20:28.920 --> 00:20:30.210
Quantum mechanically, you
can do the same thing.

00:20:30.210 --> 00:20:32.120
But I'm going to warn you for
anyone who has the chutzpah

00:20:32.120 --> 00:20:33.620
to try-- because I
encourage you to,

00:20:33.620 --> 00:20:36.280
but it takes a
little bit of brawn--

00:20:36.280 --> 00:20:38.570
think about this
operator for second.

00:20:38.570 --> 00:20:42.019
Does this classical quantity
have an obvious interpretation

00:20:42.019 --> 00:20:42.935
as a quantum operator?

00:20:45.980 --> 00:20:49.230
No, because l is r cross p.

00:20:49.230 --> 00:20:50.940
But now we have prp.

00:20:50.940 --> 00:20:52.770
There's an ordering ambiguity.

00:20:52.770 --> 00:20:54.730
So you have to decide
which order do you

00:20:54.730 --> 00:20:58.020
put that p and that r, and
the other p-- ppr, rpr,

00:20:58.020 --> 00:20:59.469
prr-- right?

00:20:59.469 --> 00:21:01.510
You can write out which
components you mean here.

00:21:01.510 --> 00:21:04.140
For example, you mean
for the z component of a,

00:21:04.140 --> 00:21:08.090
you're going to get
px ly, and ly px.

00:21:08.090 --> 00:21:12.460
But within that, how do you
order the p's and the r's,

00:21:12.460 --> 00:21:19.510
because ly contains px, and
in particular, it contains x.

00:21:19.510 --> 00:21:21.860
So there's an
ordering ambiguity.

00:21:21.860 --> 00:21:25.130
So just be a little bit
careful about this as a quantum

00:21:25.130 --> 00:21:27.470
mechanical operator if
you do play with this.

00:21:27.470 --> 00:21:30.050
But if you do it, and
you're thoughtful about it,

00:21:30.050 --> 00:21:32.850
it's pretty easy to see that
it can be computed and checked

00:21:32.850 --> 00:21:35.090
that, in fact, the
commutator vanishes.

00:21:35.090 --> 00:21:37.311
So at this point, it's
tempting to say, aha!

00:21:37.311 --> 00:21:38.810
There's an extra
conserved quantity.

00:21:38.810 --> 00:21:40.180
We declare victory.

00:21:40.180 --> 00:21:42.980
The problem is, this didn't
give us the symmetry.

00:21:42.980 --> 00:21:44.960
This just told us there's
a conserved quantity.

00:21:44.960 --> 00:21:48.361
What's the symmetry behind this?

00:21:48.361 --> 00:21:50.110
What's the symmetry
that insures that this

00:21:50.110 --> 00:21:52.070
is a conserved quantity?

00:21:52.070 --> 00:21:53.630
It's obviously not rotations.

00:21:53.630 --> 00:21:56.240
It's something else.

00:21:56.240 --> 00:21:58.400
And so there are many
answers to this question.

00:21:58.400 --> 00:22:02.840
One answer involves an explicit
expression for in phase space,

00:22:02.840 --> 00:22:05.930
the change of
variables dx-- and this

00:22:05.930 --> 00:22:15.730
is a variation that
depends on f of x and p.

00:22:15.730 --> 00:22:17.560
So there's a little
vector parameter,

00:22:17.560 --> 00:22:22.060
and the change of the
physical coordinates

00:22:22.060 --> 00:22:24.796
depends on both the
coordinates and the momenta.

00:22:24.796 --> 00:22:26.170
This is a slightly
strange thing,

00:22:26.170 --> 00:22:27.450
because it's like a
change of variables

00:22:27.450 --> 00:22:29.949
where the position gets mapped
into some non-linear function

00:22:29.949 --> 00:22:31.590
of the positions and momenta.

00:22:31.590 --> 00:22:34.580
That's a little bit weird,
but you can do this.

00:22:34.580 --> 00:22:36.622
But I don't find it a
terribly satisfying answer.

00:22:36.622 --> 00:22:38.913
And here's the answer I find
most satisfying-- it's not

00:22:38.913 --> 00:22:40.700
terribly useful for
our present purposes,

00:22:40.700 --> 00:22:43.520
but you're going to run
into this again in 805, when

00:22:43.520 --> 00:22:46.717
you do what's called the
operator method for the Coulomb

00:22:46.717 --> 00:22:48.092
potential, and it
turns out to be

00:22:48.092 --> 00:22:49.686
an enormously useful machine.

00:22:49.686 --> 00:22:51.060
We're not going
to use it in 804,

00:22:51.060 --> 00:22:52.610
but I want to
advertise it for you.

00:22:52.610 --> 00:22:53.590
I want to give you a
description, though,

00:22:53.590 --> 00:22:55.950
that isn't the description
you're going to get in 805.

00:22:55.950 --> 00:22:59.280
The description is
the following-- 1935,

00:22:59.280 --> 00:23:01.880
guy named Fock,
crazy guy, amazing,

00:23:01.880 --> 00:23:03.820
amazing physicist--
played a huge role

00:23:03.820 --> 00:23:05.660
in the development of
quantum field theory.

00:23:05.660 --> 00:23:08.290
I'm not exactly sure why he was
thinking about this problem,

00:23:08.290 --> 00:23:12.500
but he was, and this was a
very sort of Soviet thing

00:23:12.500 --> 00:23:15.150
to do at the time, I guess, to
be hard core and mathematical.

00:23:15.150 --> 00:23:18.200
So off he was going,
computing things,

00:23:18.200 --> 00:23:19.870
and he observed the
following fact--

00:23:19.870 --> 00:23:23.260
how he observed this,
again, crazy long story.

00:23:23.260 --> 00:23:26.170
He observed the following fact--
if you take a Kepler problem

00:23:26.170 --> 00:23:29.010
and you work in momentum
space-- so you write everything

00:23:29.010 --> 00:23:32.430
in terms of the momentum--
it turns out that the Kepler

00:23:32.430 --> 00:23:36.370
problem, or he referred
to as the Kepler problem,

00:23:36.370 --> 00:23:41.986
but I'll refer to it as
the Coulomb problem in 3D,

00:23:41.986 --> 00:23:45.610
three spatial dimensions--
this is really crazy--

00:23:45.610 --> 00:23:47.060
is exactly equivalent.

00:23:47.060 --> 00:23:50.202
There's a change of variables--
it's kind of complicated,

00:23:50.202 --> 00:23:51.910
but it's just a
projection, it turns out.

00:23:51.910 --> 00:23:58.980
It's exactly equivalent to
the problem of a free particle

00:23:58.980 --> 00:24:07.320
in four dimensions,
constrained to the surface

00:24:07.320 --> 00:24:11.274
of a sphere-- to a three
sphere in four dimensions.

00:24:11.274 --> 00:24:13.190
So you take a three
sphere in four dimensions.

00:24:13.190 --> 00:24:14.090
You take a marble.

00:24:14.090 --> 00:24:17.060
You kick it, but make sure
that it's stuck to the sphere.

00:24:17.060 --> 00:24:18.900
It will move in
perfect circles, right?

00:24:18.900 --> 00:24:20.400
Obviously-- it's
moving on a sphere,

00:24:20.400 --> 00:24:22.110
it's just going to
move in great circles.

00:24:22.110 --> 00:24:23.910
OK, that's nice and simple.

00:24:23.910 --> 00:24:26.950
What's the symmetry
group of that system?

00:24:26.950 --> 00:24:29.060
Well, the sphere is
invariant under any rotation

00:24:29.060 --> 00:24:31.780
in four dimensions.

00:24:31.780 --> 00:24:32.980
STUDENT: [INAUDIBLE].

00:24:32.980 --> 00:24:36.924
PROFESSOR: Ah, SO4--
there's a symmetry SO4--

00:24:36.924 --> 00:24:38.340
special orthogonal
transformation.

00:24:38.340 --> 00:24:39.965
Special means it
doesn't change length.

00:24:39.965 --> 00:24:41.730
Orthogonal means
that it's a rotation.

00:24:41.730 --> 00:24:44.930
So it's orthogonal rotations
in four dimensions,

00:24:44.930 --> 00:24:49.060
and so now, this
should sound familiar,

00:24:49.060 --> 00:24:57.780
because the angular
momentum group in 3D is SO3.

00:24:57.780 --> 00:25:01.580
It's rotations that don't change
the length in three dimensions.

00:25:01.580 --> 00:25:02.080
OK?

00:25:02.080 --> 00:25:04.050
How many elements does it have?

00:25:04.050 --> 00:25:06.587
How many conserved quantities
go along with this?

00:25:06.587 --> 00:25:08.420
Well, how many conserved
quantities go along

00:25:08.420 --> 00:25:09.878
with rotations in
three dimensions?

00:25:12.010 --> 00:25:14.510
What's conserved by virtue of
rotational invariance in three

00:25:14.510 --> 00:25:15.350
dimensions?

00:25:15.350 --> 00:25:17.766
Angular momentum-- how many
components of angular momentum

00:25:17.766 --> 00:25:18.500
are there?

00:25:18.500 --> 00:25:19.880
Three, right, there are three.

00:25:19.880 --> 00:25:23.420
So it turns out that
if you calculate in SO4

00:25:23.420 --> 00:25:27.690
how many conserved quantities
are there, there are six.

00:25:27.690 --> 00:25:29.430
And when you do this
mapping back down

00:25:29.430 --> 00:25:32.510
from the free particle in 4D
to the Coulomb problem in 3D,

00:25:32.510 --> 00:25:36.780
three of them are the l's,
and the other three of them

00:25:36.780 --> 00:25:41.280
are this A vector--
comes out spot on.

00:25:41.280 --> 00:25:44.447
So what it's telling you is
that the spectrum of hydrogen--

00:25:44.447 --> 00:25:46.280
or at least the I
shouldn't say of hydrogen,

00:25:46.280 --> 00:25:48.370
the spectrum of the
Coulomb system--

00:25:48.370 --> 00:25:50.350
has an enhanced symmetry.

00:25:50.350 --> 00:25:54.060
It's the symmetry group of
rotations in four dimensions.

00:25:54.060 --> 00:25:55.990
Why?

00:25:55.990 --> 00:25:57.790
I don't know, it's
just kind awesome.

00:25:57.790 --> 00:26:01.220
But I think that's about
the best that can be said.

00:26:01.220 --> 00:26:02.510
It's just true.

00:26:02.510 --> 00:26:04.170
So for certain very
special potentials,

00:26:04.170 --> 00:26:05.836
we find that this
sort of thing happens.

00:26:05.836 --> 00:26:07.230
It happens in
other systems, too.

00:26:07.230 --> 00:26:09.500
You discover that there
are accidental symmetries

00:26:09.500 --> 00:26:10.379
in your system.

00:26:10.379 --> 00:26:12.670
They shouldn't be referred
to as accidental symmetries.

00:26:12.670 --> 00:26:14.970
They are enormously
nontrivial functions

00:26:14.970 --> 00:26:16.774
of the rest of the
system, and we're

00:26:16.774 --> 00:26:18.440
going to break the
symmetry in a minute,

00:26:18.440 --> 00:26:20.856
and you'll see why we shouldn't
refer to it as accidental.

00:26:20.856 --> 00:26:23.080
But in any case, the
answer to the question,

00:26:23.080 --> 00:26:26.240
why do we have this giant
degeneracy in the Coulomb

00:26:26.240 --> 00:26:28.900
problem-- why is it n squared
rather than 2l plus 1--

00:26:28.900 --> 00:26:31.407
is that there is an
enhanced symmetry group.

00:26:31.407 --> 00:26:33.490
There's more symmetry then
you would have thought.

00:26:33.490 --> 00:26:35.980
And there's a conserved
quantity associated with it.

00:26:35.980 --> 00:26:37.790
And that conserved
quantity corresponds

00:26:37.790 --> 00:26:39.910
quantum mechanically
to an operator

00:26:39.910 --> 00:26:43.070
that commutes with
the energy operator.

00:26:43.070 --> 00:26:44.018
OK?

00:26:44.018 --> 00:26:46.030
Yeah.

00:26:46.030 --> 00:26:46.946
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

00:26:52.330 --> 00:26:53.521
PROFESSOR: Indeed, indeed.

00:26:53.521 --> 00:26:55.770
AUDIENCE: So how do you get
three conserved components

00:26:55.770 --> 00:26:57.995
[INAUDIBLE].

00:26:57.995 --> 00:26:58.870
PROFESSOR: Excellent.

00:26:58.870 --> 00:27:01.770
What do I mean in classical
mechanics for a quantity

00:27:01.770 --> 00:27:02.932
to be conserved?

00:27:02.932 --> 00:27:05.140
I mean that the time rate
of change of that quantity,

00:27:05.140 --> 00:27:07.620
under the classical dynamics,
under classical evolution,

00:27:07.620 --> 00:27:09.990
is preserved.

00:27:09.990 --> 00:27:13.600
So what's the quantum
mechanical version of that?

00:27:13.600 --> 00:27:15.520
So the mechanical
version of that is, well,

00:27:15.520 --> 00:27:21.310
can we say that d dt
of some operator--

00:27:21.310 --> 00:27:23.740
or of some observable a is 0.

00:27:23.740 --> 00:27:25.210
Does this makes sense?

00:27:25.210 --> 00:27:28.740
No, because it turns out,
in the language we've

00:27:28.740 --> 00:27:31.410
been using-- in the Schrodinger
evolution description

00:27:31.410 --> 00:27:32.550
that we've been using--
this doesn't really

00:27:32.550 --> 00:27:33.840
make sense, because this
thing is an operator.

00:27:33.840 --> 00:27:34.790
That's not a quantity.

00:27:34.790 --> 00:27:36.000
Quantity is something
you measure.

00:27:36.000 --> 00:27:36.958
So what do you measure?

00:27:36.958 --> 00:27:39.130
Do you measure the operator?

00:27:39.130 --> 00:27:42.394
In a state, you measure
its expectation values.

00:27:42.394 --> 00:27:43.810
You might measure
its eigenvalues,

00:27:43.810 --> 00:27:48.450
but the more general thing
is expectation values.

00:27:48.450 --> 00:27:50.640
So this is something
that depends on time,

00:27:50.640 --> 00:27:53.660
because the wave function
depends on time-- psi of t.

00:27:53.660 --> 00:27:56.390
OK, so the best to say
something is conserved,

00:27:56.390 --> 00:27:58.863
is to say d dt of A is 0.

00:28:01.790 --> 00:28:03.660
But we've seen
what the condition

00:28:03.660 --> 00:28:08.200
is for the expectation
value to not change in time.

00:28:08.200 --> 00:28:11.420
In general, for any
operator A, the time rate

00:28:11.420 --> 00:28:14.430
of change of its
expectation value

00:28:14.430 --> 00:28:27.840
is given by the
commutator of E with A.

00:28:27.840 --> 00:28:30.690
I can do the symbols-- good.

00:28:30.690 --> 00:28:35.880
OK, so in particular, if
this commutator vanishes,

00:28:35.880 --> 00:28:41.660
if the commutator vanishes--
equals 0--, this is equal to--

00:28:41.660 --> 00:28:43.960
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

00:28:43.960 --> 00:28:46.217
PROFESSOR: Sorry?

00:28:46.217 --> 00:28:48.050
Well, the wave function
can be time variant,

00:28:48.050 --> 00:28:49.030
and I'm going to
assume for the moment

00:28:49.030 --> 00:28:50.650
that the energy operator
and the A operator are not,

00:28:50.650 --> 00:28:52.600
themselves, explicitly
time dependent.

00:28:52.600 --> 00:28:54.150
Yes, that's an
important assumption.

00:28:54.150 --> 00:28:55.649
So let me just
assume for simplicity

00:28:55.649 --> 00:28:58.281
that neither the energy nor the
operator A that I'm looking at

00:28:58.281 --> 00:28:59.530
are explicitly time dependent.

00:28:59.530 --> 00:29:02.332
Like, it shouldn't
be, like, x plus tp.

00:29:02.332 --> 00:29:03.290
That would be annoying.

00:29:03.290 --> 00:29:05.634
So let me assume that
that's not the case.

00:29:05.634 --> 00:29:07.300
You do have to deal
with that sometimes.

00:29:07.300 --> 00:29:08.990
For example, if you are
dealing with a system that

00:29:08.990 --> 00:29:11.495
changes in time, where there's
a background magnetic field,

00:29:11.495 --> 00:29:13.370
or something like that,
that changes in time.

00:29:13.370 --> 00:29:14.661
But module that sort of detail.

00:29:14.661 --> 00:29:17.310
And also, there's an i h bar,
so where do the i h bars go?

00:29:20.010 --> 00:29:21.760
Do the units make sense here?

00:29:25.560 --> 00:29:26.550
A, A, good.

00:29:26.550 --> 00:29:28.100
E and d dt-- whoops.

00:29:28.100 --> 00:29:32.169
So where do the i h bars go?

00:29:32.169 --> 00:29:33.460
Well, it can go on either side.

00:29:33.460 --> 00:29:35.209
You have to tell me
if they go up or down.

00:29:37.216 --> 00:29:38.590
What is the
Schrodinger equation?

00:29:45.760 --> 00:29:49.980
Yeah, exactly, i h bar,
OK so we need an i h bar.

00:29:49.980 --> 00:29:55.460
[LAUGHTER]

00:29:55.460 --> 00:29:59.470
OK, this spring
has got to us all.

00:29:59.470 --> 00:30:03.060
So now, in the case
that e with A as 0,

00:30:03.060 --> 00:30:06.670
imagine we have an operator
a that commutes equal to 0.

00:30:06.670 --> 00:30:12.190
Then d dt of the expectation
value of A in any state

00:30:12.190 --> 00:30:13.210
is equal to 0.

00:30:13.210 --> 00:30:15.080
And that's what
I'll call conserved.

00:30:15.080 --> 00:30:17.466
So classically, to be
a conserved quantity

00:30:17.466 --> 00:30:18.840
means that it's
time independent.

00:30:18.840 --> 00:30:20.940
Quantum mechanically, to
be a conserved quantity

00:30:20.940 --> 00:30:22.635
means that it commutes
with the energy.

00:30:22.635 --> 00:30:24.760
Now, going back to the
question-- the question was,

00:30:24.760 --> 00:30:26.150
look for angular momentum.

00:30:26.150 --> 00:30:29.555
There are only two numbers you
can know at any moment in time.

00:30:29.555 --> 00:30:30.430
You can't know three.

00:30:30.430 --> 00:30:32.559
You can know the total
angular momentum, little l.

00:30:32.559 --> 00:30:34.100
And you can know
the angular momentum

00:30:34.100 --> 00:30:36.183
in a particular direction,
which we conventionally

00:30:36.183 --> 00:30:37.862
call z-- little n, right?

00:30:37.862 --> 00:30:39.820
But you can't know some
other angular momentum,

00:30:39.820 --> 00:30:41.770
like angular momentum in x
direction simultaneously.

00:30:41.770 --> 00:30:42.720
So what does it mean
to say that there

00:30:42.720 --> 00:30:43.960
are three conserved quantities?

00:30:43.960 --> 00:30:46.335
I can't know three conserved
quantities at the same time.

00:30:46.335 --> 00:30:48.640
They're not even well defined
at some moment in time.

00:30:48.640 --> 00:30:51.400
The answer is there are
three operators-- lx,

00:30:51.400 --> 00:30:54.870
and ly, and lz--
which I will simply

00:30:54.870 --> 00:31:00.200
write as l vector-- all of
which commute with E. So

00:31:00.200 --> 00:31:04.510
while it's true that
systems don't have

00:31:04.510 --> 00:31:07.460
definite values of lx,
ly and lz simultaneously,

00:31:07.460 --> 00:31:09.730
nonetheless lx, ly
and lz all commute

00:31:09.730 --> 00:31:11.245
with the energy operator.

00:31:11.245 --> 00:31:13.370
And as a consequence, their
time expectation values

00:31:13.370 --> 00:31:15.657
are all 0 in a
central potential.

00:31:15.657 --> 00:31:17.490
So the time derivatives
of their expectation

00:31:17.490 --> 00:31:18.890
are all 0s in a
central potential.

00:31:18.890 --> 00:31:20.723
They're all constant
in a central potential.

00:31:20.723 --> 00:31:21.854
Yeah.

00:31:21.854 --> 00:31:22.770
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

00:31:29.296 --> 00:31:31.654
PROFESSOR: You mean 1 over r?

00:31:31.654 --> 00:31:32.654
STUDENT: Yeah, 1 over r.

00:31:35.880 --> 00:31:38.451
PROFESSOR: So the question is,
if you don't have 1 over r,

00:31:38.451 --> 00:31:39.950
do you get extra-special
things that

00:31:39.950 --> 00:31:41.575
happen for other
potentials that aren't

00:31:41.575 --> 00:31:43.756
1 over r, but something else?

00:31:43.756 --> 00:31:44.672
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

00:31:48.514 --> 00:31:50.180
PROFESSOR: It's not
quite a unique case.

00:31:50.180 --> 00:31:54.120
So the question is-- this
is a very good question.

00:31:54.120 --> 00:31:56.931
So the question is this-- this
is a great question-- look,

00:31:56.931 --> 00:31:59.180
there's something peculiar
about 1 over r classically.

00:31:59.180 --> 00:32:01.040
The orbit's closed.

00:32:01.040 --> 00:32:01.760
You get ellipses.

00:32:01.760 --> 00:32:03.220
You don't get
progressing ellipses.

00:32:03.220 --> 00:32:05.250
That's what you get if
you have an n harmonic.

00:32:05.250 --> 00:32:07.920
If you have an extra 1 over r
to the sixth term, or something,

00:32:07.920 --> 00:32:11.040
a small correction
to 1 over r, which we

00:32:11.040 --> 00:32:12.270
do in the real solar system.

00:32:12.270 --> 00:32:14.040
It's a many body system
instead of a two-body system,

00:32:14.040 --> 00:32:15.235
so r orbit doesn't close.

00:32:15.235 --> 00:32:19.207
It's close, but--
so that's special.

00:32:19.207 --> 00:32:21.290
And here we see that there's
an enhanced symmetry.

00:32:21.290 --> 00:32:23.300
Are these things
related to each other?

00:32:23.300 --> 00:32:27.260
So the answer is almost,
in the following sense--

00:32:27.260 --> 00:32:30.200
for the harmonic oscillator,
we also have it close,

00:32:30.200 --> 00:32:33.560
but there isn't a
Runge-Lenz vector.

00:32:33.560 --> 00:32:35.102
However, the orbits
close, so there's

00:32:35.102 --> 00:32:36.685
something special
about that one, too.

00:32:36.685 --> 00:32:38.210
Is there a conserved
quantity there?

00:32:38.210 --> 00:32:39.600
And it turns out the
answer to that is yes.

00:32:39.600 --> 00:32:41.391
There's an enhanced
symmetry there as well.

00:32:41.391 --> 00:32:43.040
But it's not like this.

00:32:43.040 --> 00:32:45.210
It doesn't lead to this
gigantic degeneracy.

00:32:45.210 --> 00:32:46.780
There is just extra
structure that's

00:32:46.780 --> 00:32:48.238
nice about the
harmonic oscillator.

00:32:48.238 --> 00:32:51.400
But for the harmonic oscillator,
of course, it also closes.

00:32:51.400 --> 00:32:54.684
It's not this orbits this.

00:32:54.684 --> 00:32:56.100
So there's a nice
structure there,

00:32:56.100 --> 00:32:58.450
but it's not quite so simple.

00:33:01.260 --> 00:33:05.520
OK, yeah, one last question.

00:33:05.520 --> 00:33:12.511
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]
Kepler's problem.

00:33:12.511 --> 00:33:17.441
I was wondering if it's at all
correct thinking [INAUDIBLE]

00:33:17.441 --> 00:33:21.385
symmetry or
degeneracy [INAUDIBLE]

00:33:21.385 --> 00:33:22.890
equal time instead
of equal area?

00:33:22.890 --> 00:33:24.662
PROFESSOR: Yeah,
it's not unrelated.

00:33:24.662 --> 00:33:26.620
I don't know how to make
that connection sharp,

00:33:26.620 --> 00:33:29.391
but the thing I can say sharp--
so the question is, look,

00:33:29.391 --> 00:33:31.640
is that conserved quantity
somehow related to the fact

00:33:31.640 --> 00:33:34.880
that there's equal time in
equal-- equal areas swept out

00:33:34.880 --> 00:33:37.035
in equal time at all
points in the orbit?

00:33:37.035 --> 00:33:38.910
Which is a true thing
about a Kepler problem.

00:33:38.910 --> 00:33:40.220
That's a good observation.

00:33:40.220 --> 00:33:41.340
I don't know how to
make that connection,

00:33:41.340 --> 00:33:42.990
but it is true in
the following sense--

00:33:42.990 --> 00:33:45.114
that both of those facts
are guaranteed by the fact

00:33:45.114 --> 00:33:48.170
that you have closed orbits
with a particular ratio.

00:33:48.170 --> 00:33:50.270
And that is, indeed,
can be blamed

00:33:50.270 --> 00:33:52.939
on the conservation of
the Runge-Lenz vector.

00:33:52.939 --> 00:33:55.480
I don't know how to make that
connection direct and explicit,

00:33:55.480 --> 00:33:57.460
but indeed it is.

00:33:57.460 --> 00:33:58.550
So that's fun question.

00:33:58.550 --> 00:34:00.010
I'll have to think about that.

00:34:00.010 --> 00:34:00.792
That's a good one.

00:34:03.624 --> 00:34:05.790
One of the totally awesome
things about teaching 804

00:34:05.790 --> 00:34:07.895
is that every
single time, someone

00:34:07.895 --> 00:34:09.520
asks a question I've
never even thought

00:34:09.520 --> 00:34:11.070
of before-- forget
never answered.

00:34:11.070 --> 00:34:11.655
Never even thought of.

00:34:11.655 --> 00:34:12.655
I never thought of that.

00:34:12.655 --> 00:34:14.909
It's a great question.

00:34:14.909 --> 00:34:18.679
OK, so everyone cool
with the degeneracy?

00:34:18.679 --> 00:34:20.110
We have this
gigantic degeneracy.

00:34:20.110 --> 00:34:23.409
So knowing what the degeneracy
is, or where it's coming from,

00:34:23.409 --> 00:34:26.199
at least more or
less-- is progress.

00:34:26.199 --> 00:34:29.630
But if you really understand
why something is conserved,

00:34:29.630 --> 00:34:31.989
then you can break
that conservation.

00:34:31.989 --> 00:34:33.590
You can break that degeneracy.

00:34:33.590 --> 00:34:37.190
So here's my question,
is it possible-- can

00:34:37.190 --> 00:34:46.240
we, or indeed must we, can we
break or lift this degeneracy?

00:34:46.240 --> 00:34:48.239
So first, let me tell you
what those words mean.

00:34:51.350 --> 00:35:00.130
So we have this
gigantic degeneracy

00:35:00.130 --> 00:35:04.504
of the n squared of
the Coulomb potential.

00:35:04.504 --> 00:35:06.170
Can we break that
degeneracy or lift it?

00:35:06.170 --> 00:35:08.461
What I mean by lift the
degeneracy, what I mean by lift

00:35:08.461 --> 00:35:09.837
the degeneracy is
the following--

00:35:09.837 --> 00:35:11.586
suppose I have a system
that's degenerate,

00:35:11.586 --> 00:35:13.090
so it's got two
energy eigenstates

00:35:13.090 --> 00:35:14.440
with the same energy eigenvalue.

00:35:14.440 --> 00:35:16.330
So this is energy.

00:35:16.330 --> 00:35:18.256
Then if I can kick the
system in some way,

00:35:18.256 --> 00:35:20.830
or modify it, or bend it such
that the energy levels are

00:35:20.830 --> 00:35:23.580
no longer to
degenerate, one state

00:35:23.580 --> 00:35:25.137
has been lifted above the other.

00:35:25.137 --> 00:35:26.970
And so we use the word
to lift a degeneracy.

00:35:26.970 --> 00:35:29.011
Now you can see that
they're two different states

00:35:29.011 --> 00:35:30.300
by measuring the energies.

00:35:30.300 --> 00:35:32.330
It's also said to
split a degeneracy,

00:35:32.330 --> 00:35:33.790
or to break a degeneracy.

00:35:33.790 --> 00:35:35.117
So those are just words.

00:35:35.117 --> 00:35:36.950
OK, so can we break or
lift this degeneracy?

00:35:40.170 --> 00:35:40.792
So sure.

00:35:40.792 --> 00:35:42.000
How do we break a degeneracy?

00:35:42.000 --> 00:35:43.210
How do we lift a degeneracy?

00:35:46.610 --> 00:35:47.860
We need to break the symmetry.

00:35:54.825 --> 00:35:56.200
So if we don't
have the symmetry,

00:35:56.200 --> 00:35:57.366
we won't get the degeneracy.

00:35:57.366 --> 00:35:58.630
We've seen this before.

00:35:58.630 --> 00:36:01.100
So first off, let's
think about what

00:36:01.100 --> 00:36:02.600
are the two symmetries
that we want?

00:36:02.600 --> 00:36:04.660
Well, we got this
degeneracy of 2l plus 1

00:36:04.660 --> 00:36:06.650
from spherical symmetry.

00:36:06.650 --> 00:36:10.210
And we got this extra degeneracy
of n squared from conservation

00:36:10.210 --> 00:36:11.550
of the Runge-Lenz vector.

00:36:11.550 --> 00:36:13.300
And conservation of
the Runge-Lenz vector

00:36:13.300 --> 00:36:16.400
came from the fact that we had
exactly the Coulomb system.

00:36:16.400 --> 00:36:18.940
So anything that isn't
exactly the Coulomb system,

00:36:18.940 --> 00:36:21.470
but is still
rotationally invariant,

00:36:21.470 --> 00:36:23.280
should still have the
2l plus 1 degeneracy,

00:36:23.280 --> 00:36:25.260
but not the n
squared degeneracy--

00:36:25.260 --> 00:36:28.060
like the harmonic
oscillator, for example.

00:36:28.060 --> 00:36:29.800
So let's change the system.

00:36:29.800 --> 00:36:33.330
Let's find a small correction
to the system that leaves it

00:36:33.330 --> 00:36:36.080
mostly the Coulomb problem,
but with some small correction.

00:36:36.080 --> 00:36:40.830
So what comes to mind?

00:36:40.830 --> 00:36:45.290
So one good way to think
about a physical, natural way

00:36:45.290 --> 00:36:47.380
to break this degeneracy,
to break the symmetry,

00:36:47.380 --> 00:36:49.555
is to think a real system
that's described by the Coulomb

00:36:49.555 --> 00:36:50.055
potential.

00:36:50.055 --> 00:36:52.330
So the system that we usually
talk about is hydrogen.

00:36:52.330 --> 00:36:53.444
Hydrogen is the proton.

00:36:53.444 --> 00:36:55.360
It's got a plus charge,
and it's got electron.

00:36:55.360 --> 00:36:58.510
And it's attractive with
a minus E squared upon r.

00:36:58.510 --> 00:37:03.239
So in hydrogen, is this the
energy operator for hydrogen?

00:37:03.239 --> 00:37:05.280
Is this a good description
of the energy operator

00:37:05.280 --> 00:37:08.120
for hydrogen?

00:37:08.120 --> 00:37:10.632
It's a good start, but
it's not exactly right,

00:37:10.632 --> 00:37:11.590
for a bunch of reasons.

00:37:11.590 --> 00:37:13.620
And in fact, in your
first problem set,

00:37:13.620 --> 00:37:15.980
when you computed the time
it takes for hydrogen,

00:37:15.980 --> 00:37:23.564
classically, to decay from
the classical Bohr radius,

00:37:23.564 --> 00:37:26.230
one of the things you discovered
is that the electron starts out

00:37:26.230 --> 00:37:30.330
being non-relativistic, but very
rapidly becomes relativistic.

00:37:30.330 --> 00:37:34.030
And rapidly is 10 to
the minus 15 seconds.

00:37:34.030 --> 00:37:37.850
This is a non-relativistic, p
squared upon 2m kinetic energy.

00:37:37.850 --> 00:37:40.820
That's probably not a
perfect approximation.

00:37:40.820 --> 00:37:48.020
So the first example is going
to be relativistic corrections.

00:37:48.020 --> 00:37:49.510
Now, will relativistic
corrections

00:37:49.510 --> 00:37:50.595
break rotational symmetry?

00:37:54.260 --> 00:37:56.370
They can't, because
relativity doesn't say,

00:37:56.370 --> 00:37:57.580
this is the z direction.

00:37:57.580 --> 00:37:59.080
In fact, it does
quite the opposite.

00:37:59.080 --> 00:38:00.621
Relativity, among
other things, says,

00:38:00.621 --> 00:38:02.880
don't get too hung up on
what's the z direction.

00:38:02.880 --> 00:38:05.920
But relativistic corrections
will not break the symmetry.

00:38:05.920 --> 00:38:13.420
So if we include
relativistic corrections

00:38:13.420 --> 00:38:20.270
to the kinetic energy,
this will change E,

00:38:20.270 --> 00:38:21.910
change the energy operator.

00:38:21.910 --> 00:38:27.740
But it will preserve
the rotational symmetry.

00:38:27.740 --> 00:38:30.899
E with l is equal to 0.

00:38:30.899 --> 00:38:32.690
So we won't break this
rotational symmetry,

00:38:32.690 --> 00:38:34.160
so we'll preserve the 2l plus 1.

00:38:34.160 --> 00:38:36.890
So let's check to see
that this is true.

00:38:36.890 --> 00:38:38.940
So to check to see
that this is true,

00:38:38.940 --> 00:38:44.950
let's actually estimate out
the correction to the energy

00:38:44.950 --> 00:38:48.640
due to the first nontrivial
relativistic effect

00:38:48.640 --> 00:38:50.000
in the atom.

00:38:50.000 --> 00:38:51.970
The first nontrivial,
relativistic effect

00:38:51.970 --> 00:38:54.220
can be calculated
[INAUDIBLE] kinetic energy

00:38:54.220 --> 00:38:57.780
in special relativity,
of a particle of mass m.

00:38:57.780 --> 00:38:58.650
So that's easy.

00:38:58.650 --> 00:39:06.130
It's the total energy is
the square root of m squared

00:39:06.130 --> 00:39:12.842
c to the 4th plus p squared
c squared minus mc squared.

00:39:12.842 --> 00:39:13.800
That's the rest energy.

00:39:13.800 --> 00:39:17.830
That's the total energy, so
this is the kinetic energy.

00:39:17.830 --> 00:39:20.360
But this is equal to--
well, if we pull out

00:39:20.360 --> 00:39:21.925
a factor of m squared
c squared, this

00:39:21.925 --> 00:39:31.550
is m c squared times the square
root of 1 plus p squared over n

00:39:31.550 --> 00:39:36.054
squared c squared minus 1.

00:39:36.054 --> 00:39:37.470
And now if we
Taylor expand this--

00:39:37.470 --> 00:39:42.100
because if the momentum is small
compared to mc squared-- or mc,

00:39:42.100 --> 00:39:44.850
I should say-- the momentum is
small compared to mc which is,

00:39:44.850 --> 00:39:47.170
morally speaking,
at low velocity is,

00:39:47.170 --> 00:39:48.870
the velocity is
small compared to c,

00:39:48.870 --> 00:39:51.070
then this is 1 plus
a small number,

00:39:51.070 --> 00:39:56.120
and we can Taylor expand this to
get 1 plus 1/2 a small number.

00:39:56.120 --> 00:39:58.060
And the 1s will cancel,
giving us only 1/2.

00:39:58.060 --> 00:40:01.630
So this is going to be equal
to 1/2 of that small number,

00:40:01.630 --> 00:40:05.610
p squared over m
squared c squared,

00:40:05.610 --> 00:40:07.820
times mc squared
upstairs, giving us

00:40:07.820 --> 00:40:10.100
the first term, which
is p squared upon 2m.

00:40:10.100 --> 00:40:12.360
That's the familiar
classical kinetic energy.

00:40:12.360 --> 00:40:13.170
Rock on.

00:40:13.170 --> 00:40:14.320
What's next correction?

00:40:14.320 --> 00:40:16.400
The next correction is the next
term for this Taylor series,

00:40:16.400 --> 00:40:18.110
which is going to involve
this quantity squared,

00:40:18.110 --> 00:40:20.470
so it's going to be p to
the 4th over m to the 4th, c

00:40:20.470 --> 00:40:22.830
the 4th times mc to the 4th.

00:40:22.830 --> 00:40:25.760
The coefficient is a minus
1/8, so we get minus p

00:40:25.760 --> 00:40:31.790
to the 4th over 8m
cubed c squared.

00:40:36.380 --> 00:40:38.780
And that's down by a
factor of m squared

00:40:38.780 --> 00:40:40.900
c squared from this
guy, n of p squared

00:40:40.900 --> 00:40:42.750
upstairs-- which is
what you'd get-- p

00:40:42.750 --> 00:40:45.080
squared m squared,
over c squared, OK?

00:40:45.080 --> 00:40:47.890
So the correction to the kinetic
energy for a given momentum p

00:40:47.890 --> 00:40:51.490
is to correct it down
by p to the 4th term.

00:40:51.490 --> 00:40:52.580
Everyone cool with that?

00:40:52.580 --> 00:40:54.418
Yeah.

00:40:54.418 --> 00:40:58.150
AUDIENCE: Why do you make
the assumption [INAUDIBLE].

00:40:58.150 --> 00:41:00.390
PROFESSOR: Because
you, like Schrodinger,

00:41:00.390 --> 00:41:02.580
did problem Set One.

00:41:02.580 --> 00:41:06.050
And problem Set One said, if
you have an electron at the Bohr

00:41:06.050 --> 00:41:09.530
radius classically, its
velocity is about 1/400

00:41:09.530 --> 00:41:10.910
of the speed of light.

00:41:10.910 --> 00:41:12.350
200?

00:41:12.350 --> 00:41:13.005
It's small.

00:41:13.005 --> 00:41:14.505
It's a couple of
orders of magnitude

00:41:14.505 --> 00:41:15.838
smaller than the speed of light.

00:41:15.838 --> 00:41:19.890
So that number, that ratio
there, is 1 upon 200,

00:41:19.890 --> 00:41:21.462
or 400-- I don't
remember-- squared.

00:41:21.462 --> 00:41:22.920
That's a very small
number, so it's

00:41:22.920 --> 00:41:24.210
a reasonable approximation.

00:41:24.210 --> 00:41:26.460
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

00:41:26.460 --> 00:41:28.510
PROFESSOR: Because what
is the typical-- that's

00:41:28.510 --> 00:41:29.150
an excellent question.

00:41:29.150 --> 00:41:31.108
So why am I talking about
it as if the electron

00:41:31.108 --> 00:41:32.600
is sitting at that radius?

00:41:32.600 --> 00:41:36.680
And the answer is, well, look--
what is the average momentum?

00:41:36.680 --> 00:41:39.299
What is the average
value of p squared in,

00:41:39.299 --> 00:41:41.340
let's say, the ground
state of the hydrogen atom?

00:41:41.340 --> 00:41:42.589
What's the average value of p?

00:41:45.650 --> 00:41:47.150
What must be the
average value of p

00:41:47.150 --> 00:41:49.570
in the ground state
of the hydrogen atom?

00:41:49.570 --> 00:41:52.090
Zero on two grounds--
first off, p is a vector,

00:41:52.090 --> 00:41:54.580
and the ground state of hydrogen
is rotationally invariant.

00:41:54.580 --> 00:41:55.663
It doesn't break anything.

00:41:55.663 --> 00:41:57.630
Secondly, it's not
going anywhere.

00:41:57.630 --> 00:41:59.588
It's a bound state, so
it's just sitting there.

00:41:59.588 --> 00:42:01.640
It's got an average
momentum of 0.

00:42:01.640 --> 00:42:03.980
If it carried momentum,
it would be cruising.

00:42:03.980 --> 00:42:05.470
So it's got average momentum 0.

00:42:05.470 --> 00:42:07.553
OK, fine, but what's the
average momentum squared?

00:42:07.553 --> 00:42:09.414
What's the average of p squared?

00:42:09.414 --> 00:42:11.080
We can actually do
out that calculation.

00:42:11.080 --> 00:42:13.705
You're going to have to do that
calculation on the problem set.

00:42:13.705 --> 00:42:15.315
And it's a small number.

00:42:15.315 --> 00:42:17.190
And it's, in fact,
almost exactly what

00:42:17.190 --> 00:42:19.890
you'd guess classically
from the Bohr radius.

00:42:19.890 --> 00:42:22.456
So you have to know the
h bar to compute the Bohr

00:42:22.456 --> 00:42:24.040
radius in the first place.

00:42:24.040 --> 00:42:26.530
So the answer is, to the
best of anyone's ability

00:42:26.530 --> 00:42:29.559
to define what's the
momentum, or the typical scale

00:42:29.559 --> 00:42:31.350
of momentum, that
typical scale of momentum

00:42:31.350 --> 00:42:32.850
for the electron in the
ground state of hydrogen

00:42:32.850 --> 00:42:35.340
is extraordinarily small
compared to the speed of light

00:42:35.340 --> 00:42:37.749
by a factor of 100, 200, or 400.

00:42:37.749 --> 00:42:39.040
Does that answer your question?

00:42:39.040 --> 00:42:39.270
AUDIENCE: Yes.

00:42:39.270 --> 00:42:40.811
PROFESSOR: It's a
very good question.

00:42:40.811 --> 00:42:42.750
OK, so here's the
kinetic energy.

00:42:42.750 --> 00:42:44.881
And by the way,
another way to say

00:42:44.881 --> 00:42:46.380
that this approximation
must be good

00:42:46.380 --> 00:42:48.080
is that we've already
computed-- ignoring

00:42:48.080 --> 00:42:50.246
the relativistic correction--
we computed the ground

00:42:50.246 --> 00:42:52.070
state of energy,
and it was 13.6 Ev,

00:42:52.070 --> 00:42:55.450
which is pretty good, since
the binding energy of hydrogen

00:42:55.450 --> 00:42:57.370
is about 13.6 Ev.

00:42:57.370 --> 00:42:59.640
So apparently, that was
a good approximation.

00:42:59.640 --> 00:43:02.160
And you might be disgusted
by answer analysis like that,

00:43:02.160 --> 00:43:04.117
but that's what physics is.

00:43:04.117 --> 00:43:05.950
You write down some
stupid, cockamamie model

00:43:05.950 --> 00:43:07.350
that you know is
wrong, but if it

00:43:07.350 --> 00:43:10.522
does a good job of fitting
the data, you declare triumph,

00:43:10.522 --> 00:43:11.480
and you call Stockholm.

00:43:11.480 --> 00:43:13.440
[LAUGHTER]

00:43:13.440 --> 00:43:17.300
So it depends on the
problem you've just

00:43:17.300 --> 00:43:19.210
solved approximately.

00:43:19.210 --> 00:43:24.080
So here's the first correction.

00:43:24.080 --> 00:43:26.570
And now, what this
tells us is therefore,

00:43:26.570 --> 00:43:29.675
the energy of
hydrogen-- or at least

00:43:29.675 --> 00:43:31.050
a better model of
hydrogen-- I'll

00:43:31.050 --> 00:43:37.070
call it hydrogen tilde--
is equal to E Coulomb

00:43:37.070 --> 00:43:43.450
minus p to the 4th over
8m cubed c squared.

00:43:53.540 --> 00:43:56.870
OK so this, however, we
know is small compared

00:43:56.870 --> 00:44:00.812
to the kinetic energy, because
13.6 is pretty close to 13.6.

00:44:00.812 --> 00:44:03.270
Notice I didn't include the
rest of the significant digits.

00:44:03.270 --> 00:44:07.010
So this must be in the
insignificant digits.

00:44:07.010 --> 00:44:08.460
So this must be small.

00:44:08.460 --> 00:44:10.460
So here's what I
want to ask-- we

00:44:10.460 --> 00:44:14.400
know that the energy of
the Coulomb problem, nlm,

00:44:14.400 --> 00:44:17.660
is equal to e0 squared
minus e0 squared

00:44:17.660 --> 00:44:21.400
over n squared,
independent of l and m.

00:44:21.400 --> 00:44:25.090
What's the energy in this
toy model of hydrogen

00:44:25.090 --> 00:44:29.580
that includes the first
relativistic correction-- nlm.

00:44:29.580 --> 00:44:32.436
Well, to answer that question
we have to resolve the energy

00:44:32.436 --> 00:44:33.560
eigenvalue equation, right?

00:44:33.560 --> 00:44:35.310
We have to refined the
energy eigenstates,

00:44:35.310 --> 00:44:36.610
and we have to solve that.

00:44:36.610 --> 00:44:38.410
And this is going to be a much
worse problem, because it's

00:44:38.410 --> 00:44:40.201
going to involve a p
to the 4th term, which

00:44:40.201 --> 00:44:41.820
is going to involve
four derivatives.

00:44:41.820 --> 00:44:44.580
That sounds horrible.

00:44:44.580 --> 00:44:47.040
Can anyone think of a better
way to just approximate,

00:44:47.040 --> 00:44:50.640
estimate the magnitude and the
value of the leading correction

00:44:50.640 --> 00:44:53.163
from this quantity?

00:44:53.163 --> 00:44:53.663
Yeah.

00:44:56.960 --> 00:45:00.865
AUDIENCE: Some variation
on take an eigenvalue,

00:45:00.865 --> 00:45:03.933
plug it in, see
what the error is,

00:45:03.933 --> 00:45:06.630
correct for that error--
something like that.

00:45:06.630 --> 00:45:08.880
PROFESSOR: There's an iterative
method for doing that.

00:45:08.880 --> 00:45:10.880
It's a very good guess, but
there's an even easier way

00:45:10.880 --> 00:45:11.505
to estimate it.

00:45:11.505 --> 00:45:15.320
That's something we will
call perturbation theory when

00:45:15.320 --> 00:45:16.640
we do this in 805.

00:45:16.640 --> 00:45:19.419
And doing that systematically
is exactly the right answer.

00:45:19.419 --> 00:45:21.710
However I want you to do just
the leading part of that.

00:45:21.710 --> 00:45:22.110
Yeah.

00:45:22.110 --> 00:45:23.310
AUDIENCE: Dimensional analysis.

00:45:23.310 --> 00:45:25.518
PROFESSOR: Oh, dimensional
analysis would be awesome.

00:45:25.518 --> 00:45:29.080
That's fantastic, brilliant.

00:45:29.080 --> 00:45:30.387
So how would you compute p?

00:45:34.123 --> 00:45:35.570
OK, so we didn't calculate p.

00:45:35.570 --> 00:45:36.560
You can do a
dimensional analysis

00:45:36.560 --> 00:45:38.018
and get a p, because
you have an e,

00:45:38.018 --> 00:45:39.630
you have an l, you
can probably do it.

00:45:39.630 --> 00:45:41.004
But here's the
problem with that,

00:45:41.004 --> 00:45:43.530
though-- this is the correct
first answer to any question

00:45:43.530 --> 00:45:45.230
of this kind--
correct first answer

00:45:45.230 --> 00:45:47.826
is plug in dimensional
analysis, and get an estimate

00:45:47.826 --> 00:45:48.950
for the order of magnitude.

00:45:48.950 --> 00:45:52.030
But we want more than the
order of magnitude here.

00:45:52.030 --> 00:45:54.760
We're interested in
splitting the degeneracy

00:45:54.760 --> 00:45:56.154
due to this interaction.

00:45:56.154 --> 00:45:58.570
So what that means is we want
to see that different values

00:45:58.570 --> 00:46:01.330
use of l lead to
different energy.

00:46:01.330 --> 00:46:03.560
What we care about
is the l dependence

00:46:03.560 --> 00:46:04.980
that comes out of
this correction.

00:46:04.980 --> 00:46:07.230
And we're not going to be
able to get the l dependence

00:46:07.230 --> 00:46:10.390
from dimensional analysis,
because l is an integer.

00:46:10.390 --> 00:46:12.300
It is dimensionless.

00:46:12.300 --> 00:46:14.750
Yeah, so that will give
you the correct magnitude,

00:46:14.750 --> 00:46:17.220
and that is the
first thing you do.

00:46:17.220 --> 00:46:18.934
What's the second thing you do?

00:46:18.934 --> 00:46:20.600
AUDIENCE: Stick in
the expectation value

00:46:20.600 --> 00:46:21.365
of p to the 4th.

00:46:21.365 --> 00:46:22.240
PROFESSOR: Excellent.

00:46:22.240 --> 00:46:24.670
Let's just stick in the
expectation value p to the 4th.

00:46:24.670 --> 00:46:26.420
That's not exactly
the right thing to do,

00:46:26.420 --> 00:46:28.987
but if this is small, that's
probably pretty reasonable.

00:46:28.987 --> 00:46:31.320
And what you'll find when you
do it systematically using

00:46:31.320 --> 00:46:33.520
perturbation theory, as
was pointed out earlier,

00:46:33.520 --> 00:46:36.780
we can take the entire system,
the entire energy eigenvalue

00:46:36.780 --> 00:46:38.800
equation-- we can
think of this 1 over m

00:46:38.800 --> 00:46:41.439
cubed c squared
as a small number,

00:46:41.439 --> 00:46:43.730
and we can do perturbation
theory on that small number.

00:46:43.730 --> 00:46:46.120
We can Taylor expand everything
in that small number.

00:46:46.120 --> 00:46:48.690
And when you Taylor expand
the exact equation, what

00:46:48.690 --> 00:46:52.470
you discover is the leading
term in that Taylor expansion

00:46:52.470 --> 00:46:55.040
is the expectation value
p to the 4th over 8m cubed

00:46:55.040 --> 00:46:56.260
c squared.

00:46:56.260 --> 00:46:57.970
OK, so this is a
fantastic guess.

00:46:57.970 --> 00:46:59.490
OK, so let's compute it.

00:46:59.490 --> 00:47:02.930
So E hydrogen is going to be
equal to E nlm, which I'm just

00:47:02.930 --> 00:47:06.020
to write as minus
E0 over m squared.

00:47:23.600 --> 00:47:27.210
OK, so what is the
correct answer here?

00:47:27.210 --> 00:47:30.450
So it's this quantity
minus-- so this

00:47:30.450 --> 00:47:31.940
is making it more tightly bound.

00:47:31.940 --> 00:47:33.790
Notice the sign,
because p to the 4th

00:47:33.790 --> 00:47:36.770
is strictly positive
if p is real.

00:47:36.770 --> 00:47:38.670
So minus E0 over m
squared, and if you go out

00:47:38.670 --> 00:47:40.711
and you do this expectation
value, which I really

00:47:40.711 --> 00:47:43.839
should have put on the
problem set-- oh, I still can.

00:47:43.839 --> 00:47:46.380
It hasn't been posted yet, so
it'll be posted this afternoon.

00:47:46.380 --> 00:47:48.600
But I won't.

00:47:48.600 --> 00:47:51.450
It's not that bad, actually.

00:47:51.450 --> 00:47:53.680
[LAUGHTER]

00:47:53.680 --> 00:47:54.923
Matt, what do you think?

00:47:54.923 --> 00:47:56.855
AUDIENCE: No!

00:47:56.855 --> 00:48:00.240
[LAUGHS]

00:48:00.240 --> 00:48:02.680
PROFESSOR: We'll discuss
this afterwards, OK?

00:48:02.680 --> 00:48:05.299
Which may or may not
appear on your problem set.

00:48:05.299 --> 00:48:07.840
So if you go ahead and you do
this calculation, what you find

00:48:07.840 --> 00:48:12.497
is the correction is En
squared, so E0 squared over n

00:48:12.497 --> 00:48:14.580
to the 4th-- this time it
really is n to the 4th--

00:48:14.580 --> 00:48:16.370
and now you have to worry
about dimensional analysis.

00:48:16.370 --> 00:48:17.400
This is two energies.

00:48:17.400 --> 00:48:20.806
We want one energy, divided
by-- wait for it-- mc squared,

00:48:20.806 --> 00:48:22.430
because it's a
relativistic correction.

00:48:22.430 --> 00:48:24.110
That shouldn't be
too surprising.

00:48:24.110 --> 00:48:27.765
Times the quantity
4n over-- and here

00:48:27.765 --> 00:48:32.932
where life gets awesome--
l plus 1/2 minus 3.

00:48:32.932 --> 00:48:37.550
[LAUGHTER]

00:48:37.550 --> 00:48:40.990
PROFESSOR: You laugh,
but I feel delighted

00:48:40.990 --> 00:48:42.480
by this for so many reasons.

00:48:42.480 --> 00:48:44.090
One is, that's beautiful.

00:48:44.090 --> 00:48:45.650
What a crazy
combination of symbols.

00:48:45.650 --> 00:48:47.100
But the second
and more important

00:48:47.100 --> 00:48:52.390
one is, look it has an l in it,
and the l is downstairs, right?

00:48:52.390 --> 00:48:53.891
That's good.

00:48:53.891 --> 00:48:55.140
It has more leverage that way.

00:48:55.140 --> 00:48:57.960
But so we've got
this l appearing,

00:48:57.960 --> 00:49:01.780
so the energy depends on l.

00:49:01.780 --> 00:49:03.200
Good, we've broken
the degeneracy.

00:49:03.200 --> 00:49:05.957
Different values of l
give different energies.

00:49:05.957 --> 00:49:07.165
So let's do that graphically.

00:49:12.510 --> 00:49:17.130
So in particular,
what this tells

00:49:17.130 --> 00:49:23.780
us is that now while the
Coulomb energy commuted

00:49:23.780 --> 00:49:26.950
with the Runge-Lenz
vector, it must be true

00:49:26.950 --> 00:49:29.960
that the energy of
this model of hydrogen,

00:49:29.960 --> 00:49:33.620
which includes the first
relativistic correction,

00:49:33.620 --> 00:49:36.960
does not commute with
the Runge-Lenz vector.

00:49:36.960 --> 00:49:38.810
And indeed, if you
check this-- which

00:49:38.810 --> 00:49:42.160
is effortful, but
not intellectually

00:49:42.160 --> 00:49:45.870
difficult-- indeed,
it doesn't vanish.

00:49:45.870 --> 00:49:48.540
And the failure of this
conservation equation,

00:49:48.540 --> 00:49:52.430
the failure this commutational
relation to vanish,

00:49:52.430 --> 00:49:54.720
tell us that it's
possible for the system

00:49:54.720 --> 00:49:55.760
to not be degenerate.

00:49:55.760 --> 00:49:58.430
And lo and behold,
it is not degenerate.

00:49:58.430 --> 00:49:59.680
OK?

00:49:59.680 --> 00:50:00.500
Yeah.

00:50:00.500 --> 00:50:03.120
AUDIENCE: So I just wanted
to clarify something that--

00:50:03.120 --> 00:50:06.424
did you say before that the
actual first term when you

00:50:06.424 --> 00:50:08.532
encounter relativity just
includes substituting

00:50:08.532 --> 00:50:11.516
the non-relativistic
p to the 4th?

00:50:11.516 --> 00:50:12.140
PROFESSOR: Yes.

00:50:12.140 --> 00:50:13.010
Sorry, I should have said that.

00:50:13.010 --> 00:50:15.190
There are other things are
important for relativity

00:50:15.190 --> 00:50:16.648
that we'll come to
in a little bit.

00:50:16.648 --> 00:50:18.700
But if you just look
at the kinetic energy,

00:50:18.700 --> 00:50:21.172
this is the first
non-trivial correction.

00:50:21.172 --> 00:50:23.020
Yeah.

00:50:23.020 --> 00:50:25.330
AUDIENCE: So we still have
the 2l plus 1 degeneracy.

00:50:25.330 --> 00:50:27.950
PROFESSOR: We still have the
2l plus 1 degeneracy, exactly.

00:50:27.950 --> 00:50:31.796
Because does this correction
violate rotational invariance?

00:50:31.796 --> 00:50:32.670
No, that's p squared.

00:50:32.670 --> 00:50:33.961
That's a scalar under rotation.

00:50:33.961 --> 00:50:36.070
It's just the
number, not a vector.

00:50:36.070 --> 00:50:42.320
But E still commutes with l.

00:50:42.320 --> 00:50:45.310
And you see that because this
is independent of little m.

00:50:45.310 --> 00:50:47.160
This is the mass
of the electron.

00:50:47.160 --> 00:50:49.460
So this is independent of
the quantum number little m.

00:50:49.460 --> 00:50:53.630
It only depends on the
quantum number little l.

00:50:53.630 --> 00:50:55.220
So indeed, it is
still degenerate.

00:50:55.220 --> 00:50:58.997
So let's go through this and
see the degeneracy explicitly.

00:50:58.997 --> 00:51:01.330
And let me do that by drawing
you the following diagram.

00:51:01.330 --> 00:51:08.780
So what happens if we have
E1, which is the ground state?

00:51:08.780 --> 00:51:13.670
It has some energy which is
negative, which is minus E0.

00:51:13.670 --> 00:51:17.700
And when we include this first
correction, what does it do?

00:51:17.700 --> 00:51:19.542
Well, it decreases
it by some amount.

00:51:22.640 --> 00:51:23.962
Everyone cool with that?

00:51:23.962 --> 00:51:25.170
It doesn't change the number.

00:51:25.170 --> 00:51:26.860
It doesn't split any degeneracy,
because there was only

00:51:26.860 --> 00:51:28.360
one ground state
in the first place,

00:51:28.360 --> 00:51:30.590
because l had to
be 0 when n is 1.

00:51:30.590 --> 00:51:33.690
l has to be one less
than n or smaller.

00:51:33.690 --> 00:51:35.780
And if n is 1, l has to be 0.

00:51:35.780 --> 00:51:38.030
It can't be any smaller
than 0, so it's 0.

00:51:38.030 --> 00:51:40.530
There's just a one state,
with degeneracy 2, 0

00:51:40.530 --> 00:51:42.850
plus 1, which is 1.

00:51:42.850 --> 00:51:43.760
OK so that's fine.

00:51:43.760 --> 00:51:46.400
It just changes the ground
state by some amount.

00:51:46.400 --> 00:51:48.380
Let's consider the
second excited level.

00:51:48.380 --> 00:51:50.741
So in the second excited
level, we have the states--

00:51:50.741 --> 00:51:52.490
and let me name this
slightly differently,

00:51:52.490 --> 00:51:54.170
so this has energy minus E0.

00:51:54.170 --> 00:52:00.490
The ground state had l
equals 0, and m equals 0.

00:52:00.490 --> 00:52:02.370
It had to.

00:52:02.370 --> 00:52:04.770
For the second excited
state, n equals 2,

00:52:04.770 --> 00:52:08.180
how many states are there?

00:52:08.180 --> 00:52:12.470
2 squared is 4, so there are
four states, two, three, four.

00:52:12.470 --> 00:52:14.640
And what are their
values of l and m?

00:52:14.640 --> 00:52:18.660
Well, if n is 2, l
can be either 0 or 1.

00:52:18.660 --> 00:52:20.650
If it's 0, then m has to be 0.

00:52:20.650 --> 00:52:23.455
If it's 1, m could be
1, or it could be 0,

00:52:23.455 --> 00:52:27.170
or it could be minus 1.

00:52:27.170 --> 00:52:29.700
So this, again, is lm, lm, lm.

00:52:29.700 --> 00:52:33.280
So those are the four states
with energy E2 in the hydrogen

00:52:33.280 --> 00:52:33.986
atom.

00:52:33.986 --> 00:52:36.360
And now when we ask, what are
the energies of these three

00:52:36.360 --> 00:52:40.320
states, when we include this
so-called fine structure, what

00:52:40.320 --> 00:52:41.660
is this going to do?

00:52:41.660 --> 00:52:43.940
Well, the ground state is
going to get pushed down

00:52:43.940 --> 00:52:44.600
by some amount.

00:52:47.820 --> 00:52:50.290
I should draw this differently
to make it more vivid.

00:52:52.957 --> 00:52:55.415
This gets pushed down by some
amount, with some value of l.

00:52:55.415 --> 00:52:57.330
l here is 0.

00:52:57.330 --> 00:52:59.250
But for these
three states, which

00:52:59.250 --> 00:53:01.420
all have the same
value of little l, 1,

00:53:01.420 --> 00:53:03.360
the denominator is larger.

00:53:03.360 --> 00:53:06.260
So the amount by which it
gets pushed down is less.

00:53:06.260 --> 00:53:08.384
So these three states
get pushed down less,

00:53:08.384 --> 00:53:09.800
but the same amount
as each other.

00:53:13.830 --> 00:53:15.730
That cool?

00:53:15.730 --> 00:53:22.350
So these three states--
degeneracy is 3,

00:53:22.350 --> 00:53:24.800
and this state degeneracy is 1.

00:53:24.800 --> 00:53:29.410
Now, notice that 1
plus 3 is equal to 4

00:53:29.410 --> 00:53:32.130
is equal to n squared.

00:53:32.130 --> 00:53:37.470
So these states split
into multiplets-- groups

00:53:37.470 --> 00:53:40.135
of states-- which have
to have the same energy

00:53:40.135 --> 00:53:42.214
by rotational invariance.

00:53:42.214 --> 00:53:43.630
If they have l
equas 1, there must

00:53:43.630 --> 00:53:46.260
be three states with the
same energy-- there must be.

00:53:46.260 --> 00:53:49.020
And states with l equals 0,
there's just the one state.

00:53:51.740 --> 00:53:54.520
And if we did the
same thing for E3,

00:53:54.520 --> 00:53:56.560
let's just think about
what would happen.

00:53:56.560 --> 00:53:58.140
So I'm just going
to write the l.

00:53:58.140 --> 00:53:59.431
I'm not going to include the m.

00:53:59.431 --> 00:54:03.940
We have the l equals 0 times 1.

00:54:03.940 --> 00:54:07.500
We have the l equals
1 state, times 3.

00:54:07.500 --> 00:54:09.060
And we have l equals 2 state.

00:54:09.060 --> 00:54:12.180
And how many states are there
in the l equals 2 state?

00:54:12.180 --> 00:54:14.180
Times 5, good.

00:54:14.180 --> 00:54:16.860
And again, this gets
pushed down to some value.

00:54:16.860 --> 00:54:18.360
This gets pushed
down to some value.

00:54:18.360 --> 00:54:20.800
This gets pushed
down to some value,

00:54:20.800 --> 00:54:24.012
where this is one,
three, and five.

00:54:24.012 --> 00:54:25.470
And again, these
add up to 9, which

00:54:25.470 --> 00:54:27.180
is 3 squared-- the degeneracy.

00:54:27.180 --> 00:54:29.930
So by turning on the
relativistic corrections,

00:54:29.930 --> 00:54:31.170
we break this degeneracy.

00:54:31.170 --> 00:54:32.170
We lift this degeneracy.

00:54:32.170 --> 00:54:38.104
You break the symmetry,
you lift the degeneracy.

00:54:38.104 --> 00:54:39.520
Now, unfortunately,
this isn't one

00:54:39.520 --> 00:54:41.700
we can control by turning
a dial in the lab.

00:54:41.700 --> 00:54:44.140
No experiment that
I can do in the lab

00:54:44.140 --> 00:54:46.160
will change the value
of the speed of light.

00:54:48.425 --> 00:54:49.925
Well, actually there
are experiments

00:54:49.925 --> 00:54:51.966
that will change the value
of the speed of light.

00:54:51.966 --> 00:54:55.269
If you work in medium, the
effective speed of light

00:54:55.269 --> 00:54:55.810
is different.

00:54:55.810 --> 00:54:57.804
So that's going to change
relativistic effects.

00:54:57.804 --> 00:54:58.720
So that's interesting.

00:54:58.720 --> 00:55:01.178
That tells you that you can
actually vary this continuously

00:55:01.178 --> 00:55:04.220
if you can vary continuously
the index of refraction

00:55:04.220 --> 00:55:06.569
of the ambient system.

00:55:06.569 --> 00:55:08.610
I invite you to think
about how you might do that

00:55:08.610 --> 00:55:10.925
experimentally, because
it's a fun question.

00:55:13.940 --> 00:55:16.150
OK, however, what
I'd really like

00:55:16.150 --> 00:55:19.660
is something where
Professor Evan in his lab

00:55:19.660 --> 00:55:26.730
can actually turn a dial,
and change the spectrum

00:55:26.730 --> 00:55:28.870
in a way that explicitly
breaks the symmetry.

00:55:28.870 --> 00:55:30.350
Meanwhile, I also
want an example

00:55:30.350 --> 00:55:32.570
that breaks the
rotational invariance.

00:55:32.570 --> 00:55:34.910
I want to break the 2l
plus 1 states up into 2l

00:55:34.910 --> 00:55:36.550
plus 1 states with
different energies.

00:55:36.550 --> 00:55:38.876
I want to make them
depend on the angular

00:55:38.876 --> 00:55:40.000
momentum in some direction.

00:55:40.000 --> 00:55:42.095
What must I do in order
to lift that degeneracy?

00:55:47.670 --> 00:55:49.120
AUDIENCE: Add a magnetic field.

00:55:49.120 --> 00:55:49.510
PROFESSOR: Fantastic.

00:55:49.510 --> 00:55:51.200
If you add a magnetic
field, why is that

00:55:51.200 --> 00:55:52.449
going to break the degeneracy?

00:55:56.194 --> 00:55:57.110
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

00:56:02.255 --> 00:56:03.630
PROFESSOR: Give
me an answer that

00:56:03.630 --> 00:56:05.610
depends, not on your
knowledge of chemistry,

00:56:05.610 --> 00:56:09.860
but give me an answer that
depends on symmetries.

00:56:09.860 --> 00:56:11.342
Why doe turning on
a magnetic field

00:56:11.342 --> 00:56:13.800
have the potential to split
the degeneracy of the 2l plus 1

00:56:13.800 --> 00:56:14.120
states?

00:56:14.120 --> 00:56:15.840
AUDIENCE: You don't have
rotational symmetry.

00:56:15.840 --> 00:56:16.830
PROFESSOR: Thank you, exactly.

00:56:16.830 --> 00:56:18.680
You have no rotational
symmetry, exactly.

00:56:18.680 --> 00:56:19.760
So that's pretty good.

00:56:19.760 --> 00:56:29.330
So let's break the 2l plus 1 by
breaking rotational symmetry.

00:56:29.330 --> 00:56:32.672
There are many ways we could
break rotational symmetry.

00:56:32.672 --> 00:56:34.130
We could turn on
an electric field.

00:56:34.130 --> 00:56:35.910
We could turn on
a magnetic field.

00:56:35.910 --> 00:56:39.597
We could put a
shovel in the room.

00:56:39.597 --> 00:56:41.930
But anything that breaks
rotational symmetry will do it,

00:56:41.930 --> 00:56:44.250
but a very convenient way is
to do it with a magnetic field.

00:56:44.250 --> 00:56:45.958
Magnetic field is
particularly beautiful.

00:56:45.958 --> 00:56:50.060
So this is effect is now
call the Zeeman effect.

00:56:50.060 --> 00:56:54.190
I believe it was
Faraday-- one of

00:56:54.190 --> 00:56:59.580
the classic electromagnetists
of the 19th century attempted

00:56:59.580 --> 00:57:02.770
to look at the spectral
lines coming off glowing gas,

00:57:02.770 --> 00:57:04.790
and see if they
changed by turning

00:57:04.790 --> 00:57:06.407
on an electric or
a magnetic field.

00:57:06.407 --> 00:57:07.990
It turns out to be
a tricky experiment

00:57:07.990 --> 00:57:10.130
to do, because you need to
have a very well-controlled

00:57:10.130 --> 00:57:11.380
magnetic field,
otherwise what you

00:57:11.380 --> 00:57:12.790
get is just a bunch of schmutz.

00:57:12.790 --> 00:57:15.380
So to get a clean
spectrum, you have

00:57:15.380 --> 00:57:18.550
to have a very uniform magnetic
field, which is not trivial.

00:57:18.550 --> 00:57:19.800
It has to be time independent.

00:57:19.800 --> 00:57:23.477
So Zeeman, at the very end of
the 19th century-- in fact,

00:57:23.477 --> 00:57:25.310
this experiment was
done, I believe, in '96.

00:57:28.790 --> 00:57:32.170
So I think the paper
came out in '97

00:57:32.170 --> 00:57:34.455
but the experiment
was done in '96.

00:57:34.455 --> 00:57:35.580
Zeeman did this experiment.

00:57:35.580 --> 00:57:37.210
He said look, if i turn
on a magnetic field

00:57:37.210 --> 00:57:39.418
next to a hot, glowing gas
and look the spectrum that

00:57:39.418 --> 00:57:43.060
comes off, anything
happen to it?

00:57:43.060 --> 00:57:46.931
Why would you think that
anything might happen?

00:57:46.931 --> 00:57:48.930
And the answer to this
one is really quite nice.

00:57:48.930 --> 00:57:51.130
Look, if we compute
the energy, the energy

00:57:51.130 --> 00:57:53.710
is going to be
equal to the Coulomb

00:57:53.710 --> 00:57:57.030
energy plus a correction,
which is the following--

00:57:57.030 --> 00:58:00.540
if you think of the atom
as an electron that carries

00:58:00.540 --> 00:58:03.599
some angular momentum in
the presence of a proton,

00:58:03.599 --> 00:58:06.140
if you think of the electron as
a thing carrying some angular

00:58:06.140 --> 00:58:07.681
momentum, and a
thing with a charge--

00:58:07.681 --> 00:58:09.940
it has a charge and
angular momentum.

00:58:09.940 --> 00:58:12.100
It's going to have
magnetic moment, mu.

00:58:12.100 --> 00:58:13.800
And the magnetic
moment is going to be

00:58:13.800 --> 00:58:21.000
equal to the current of the
charge times the area swept out

00:58:21.000 --> 00:58:24.220
divided by c, because we
work with sensible units.

00:58:24.220 --> 00:58:36.750
And this is equal to minus--
for the case of the atom--

00:58:36.750 --> 00:58:41.180
minus mu, the magnetic
moment of the system

00:58:41.180 --> 00:58:43.920
dotted into the magnetic
field that you turn on

00:58:43.920 --> 00:58:44.670
in the background.

00:58:44.670 --> 00:58:46.420
So this is a background
magnetic field.

00:58:46.420 --> 00:58:48.049
I am turning on an
electromagnet, which

00:58:48.049 --> 00:58:50.090
induces a magnetic field
in some known direction,

00:58:50.090 --> 00:58:51.670
with some known magnitude.

00:58:51.670 --> 00:58:53.630
So my dial is the
magnitude of that B field.

00:58:53.630 --> 00:58:55.920
I could make it large,
or I could make it small.

00:58:55.920 --> 00:58:58.010
And it's in a known direction.

00:58:58.010 --> 00:59:02.034
And the point is, our electron
because it's orbiting,

00:59:02.034 --> 00:59:03.700
because it carries
some angular momentum

00:59:03.700 --> 00:59:06.506
and it carries some in charge,
has some magnetic moment.

00:59:06.506 --> 00:59:08.130
So it behaves like
a little bar magnet.

00:59:08.130 --> 00:59:10.200
And that bar magnet wants to
anti-align with the background

00:59:10.200 --> 00:59:11.800
magnetic field that
I've turned on.

00:59:11.800 --> 00:59:14.550
So there's an energy penalty
to not being aligned.

00:59:14.550 --> 00:59:21.550
This is the usual dipole-dipole
potential from electrostatics.

00:59:21.550 --> 00:59:29.160
OK and mu here is equal to minus
E over 2mc-- angular momentum.

00:59:32.920 --> 00:59:36.370
So this can be computed from
a simple model of the atom.

00:59:39.540 --> 00:59:40.930
Whatever, it's easy to compute.

00:59:40.930 --> 00:59:44.201
So this is slightly
annoying, because if E

00:59:44.201 --> 00:59:46.700
is in some arbitrary direction,
let's just simplify our life

00:59:46.700 --> 00:59:50.392
and say that's equal to
E Coulomb minus mu B.

00:59:50.392 --> 00:59:52.350
And I want to turn on a
magnetic field of known

00:59:52.350 --> 00:59:53.650
amplitude in a known direction.

00:59:53.650 --> 00:59:54.899
Let's call it the z direction.

00:59:54.899 --> 00:59:57.480
So this is mu z.

00:59:57.480 --> 01:00:03.040
But this mu z, that's just mu
z is lz times minus E over 2mc.

01:00:03.040 --> 01:00:09.190
So this is going to
be plus E over 2mc,

01:00:09.190 --> 01:00:11.874
Bz-- I'm going to put
this all together, Bz Lz.

01:00:16.440 --> 01:00:18.321
Everyone cool with that?

01:00:18.321 --> 01:00:19.820
So where this is
coming from, again,

01:00:19.820 --> 01:00:23.000
is just the angular momentum
is telling you the velocity.

01:00:23.000 --> 01:00:25.380
The velocity is telling
you the current.

01:00:25.380 --> 01:00:27.790
And then the area is the radius.

01:00:27.790 --> 01:00:33.581
So that's what's giving you
the radius and the angular

01:00:33.581 --> 01:00:34.080
momentum.

01:00:36.820 --> 01:00:39.907
So this is our energy.

01:00:39.907 --> 01:00:42.115
What does this tell you
about the energy eigenvalues?

01:00:45.340 --> 01:00:47.340
They depend on m, right?

01:00:47.340 --> 01:00:49.250
And do we have to solve
the energy eigenvalue

01:00:49.250 --> 01:00:51.080
equation again?

01:00:51.080 --> 01:00:54.060
No, because our energy
eigenfunctions of Ec

01:00:54.060 --> 01:00:55.950
are proportional to
ylm, so they're already

01:00:55.950 --> 01:00:59.300
eigenfunctions of lz.

01:00:59.300 --> 01:01:03.050
So when I take this beast, and
I act on the wave functions

01:01:03.050 --> 01:01:08.440
I erased, but on the 1 upon
little r, capital R, sub nl, y

01:01:08.440 --> 01:01:10.810
sub lm-- when I act
on the ylm's, this

01:01:10.810 --> 01:01:14.880
is just going to give
me h bar m, right?

01:01:14.880 --> 01:01:18.877
So this is just a constant when
acting on the Coulomb energy

01:01:18.877 --> 01:01:19.460
eigenfunction.

01:01:19.460 --> 01:01:20.460
So this is a much
easier problem.

01:01:20.460 --> 01:01:22.793
That way, we don't even have
to make any approximations.

01:01:22.793 --> 01:01:29.280
We can just say exactly energy
Zeeman is equal to minus E0

01:01:29.280 --> 01:01:40.960
upon n squared, nlm
plus E h bar upon 2mc,

01:01:40.960 --> 01:01:42.650
Bz-- the background
magnetic field,

01:01:42.650 --> 01:01:47.730
and this is the m of electron
mass-- times little m.

01:01:47.730 --> 01:01:49.720
And I'm going to write
little m sub l, just

01:01:49.720 --> 01:01:56.676
to distinguish little
m sub l from m sub E.

01:01:56.676 --> 01:01:58.050
So when we turn
on the prediction

01:01:58.050 --> 01:02:02.280
here, when we turn on the
magnetic field a la Zeeman,

01:02:02.280 --> 01:02:04.590
our energy levels will
get split according

01:02:04.590 --> 01:02:07.160
to the different values of m.

01:02:07.160 --> 01:02:10.812
Now if instead of working
with the pure Coulomb system,

01:02:10.812 --> 01:02:12.270
if we were in fact
a little clever,

01:02:12.270 --> 01:02:14.490
and we'd already noticed that
there's a fine structure--

01:02:14.490 --> 01:02:15.600
because they already
knew that there

01:02:15.600 --> 01:02:17.100
was a fine structure
at this point--

01:02:17.100 --> 01:02:20.380
they could see the
different spectra

01:02:20.380 --> 01:02:24.936
in lines coming off of hot gas.

01:02:24.936 --> 01:02:26.310
So it's just an
experimental fact

01:02:26.310 --> 01:02:27.893
you can't turn off
the fine structure.

01:02:27.893 --> 01:02:33.507
This is going to be equal
to e nlm of our correction

01:02:33.507 --> 01:02:35.840
to the hydrogen atom, with
the fine structure corrected.

01:02:35.840 --> 01:02:39.670
So the l equals 1 states and
the l equals 0 states are split.

01:02:39.670 --> 01:02:42.967
Let's focus, for example, on E2.

01:02:42.967 --> 01:02:44.550
So these guys have
a different energy.

01:02:44.550 --> 01:02:46.341
The l equals 1 guys
have a different energy

01:02:46.341 --> 01:02:47.970
than the l equals 0 guys.

01:02:47.970 --> 01:02:49.990
What does this predict
is going to happen

01:02:49.990 --> 01:02:52.240
if I look at my spectral line?

01:02:52.240 --> 01:02:54.930
So what this predicts
is the following--

01:02:54.930 --> 01:02:57.630
it says that if you
have some spectrum that

01:02:57.630 --> 01:03:08.660
looks like this-- so this is
as a function of wavelength

01:03:08.660 --> 01:03:12.650
and i'm looking literally
at what comes off a prism.

01:03:12.650 --> 01:03:14.050
I'm looking at spectrum lines.

01:03:14.050 --> 01:03:15.740
And I'll have a line here.

01:03:15.740 --> 01:03:17.900
And these are going to
be the l equals 0 states.

01:03:17.900 --> 01:03:20.770
This is n equals 2.

01:03:20.770 --> 01:03:22.860
And then there's the
l equals 1 states.

01:03:22.860 --> 01:03:25.820
This is with zero magnetic
field-- Bz equals 0.

01:03:29.820 --> 01:03:38.040
If we turn on a magnetic
field, Bz not equal to zero,

01:03:38.040 --> 01:03:39.720
what should we see?

01:03:39.720 --> 01:03:43.140
Well, what happens
to this state?

01:03:43.140 --> 01:03:46.610
Nothing-- it's the same thing,
because the m is strictly 0,

01:03:46.610 --> 01:03:48.050
so it's the same value.

01:03:48.050 --> 01:03:50.850
And this guy, what
happens to it?

01:03:50.850 --> 01:03:53.242
The m equals 0
state is the same.

01:03:53.242 --> 01:03:54.950
But then it breaks
up-- as everyone said,

01:03:54.950 --> 01:03:57.555
it breaks up into three lines
that are equally spaced.

01:04:01.260 --> 01:04:03.710
It breaks up into three
lines, because one of them

01:04:03.710 --> 01:04:06.750
has m which is plus 1, one
of them has m which is 0,

01:04:06.750 --> 01:04:08.540
and one is m is minus 1.

01:04:08.540 --> 01:04:10.770
So energies will
increase or decrease.

01:04:10.770 --> 01:04:14.170
Let's say this is frequency.

01:04:14.170 --> 01:04:15.290
So we get this splitting.

01:04:15.290 --> 01:04:18.460
And another way to draw
this is as a function of B,

01:04:18.460 --> 01:04:21.570
let's draw the energy levels.

01:04:21.570 --> 01:04:22.680
So there's the 1.

01:04:22.680 --> 01:04:24.150
There's the 0.

01:04:24.150 --> 01:04:25.960
And this stays constant.

01:04:25.960 --> 01:04:30.035
And these guys-- one is
constant, one increases,

01:04:30.035 --> 01:04:30.785
and one decreases.

01:04:34.006 --> 01:04:36.130
When you start getting into
strong magnetic fields,

01:04:36.130 --> 01:04:38.025
weird things happen,
like these guys cross,

01:04:38.025 --> 01:04:40.930
and all sorts of subtle
things can happen.

01:04:40.930 --> 01:04:42.930
But let's ignore the
strong magnetic field case,

01:04:42.930 --> 01:04:44.010
and just focus on this.

01:04:44.010 --> 01:04:46.290
So we see that these guys split.

01:04:46.290 --> 01:04:51.690
So this is what the Schrodinger
theory, or the full story

01:04:51.690 --> 01:04:54.000
would predict-- it came
a little bit after this,

01:04:54.000 --> 01:04:57.097
but this experiment
was done in '96,

01:04:57.097 --> 01:04:59.680
so there's actually kind of an
entertaining story about people

01:04:59.680 --> 01:05:01.560
trying to explain this
effect classically.

01:05:01.560 --> 01:05:03.010
Well, look you could
have some angular

01:05:03.010 --> 01:05:04.445
momentum in the z
direction, some angular

01:05:04.445 --> 01:05:06.030
momentum in the x direction,
some angular momentum in the y

01:05:06.030 --> 01:05:06.810
direction.

01:05:06.810 --> 01:05:09.018
The part that has angular
momentum in the x direction

01:05:09.018 --> 01:05:11.170
doesn't do anything,
or in the z direction.

01:05:11.170 --> 01:05:12.795
The part with the x
and part with the y

01:05:12.795 --> 01:05:13.982
can have different polars.

01:05:13.982 --> 01:05:15.690
There's a whole
classical song and dance.

01:05:15.690 --> 01:05:16.290
It's crazy.

01:05:16.290 --> 01:05:17.230
It doesn't make any sense.

01:05:17.230 --> 01:05:18.980
But that's because they were
trying to classical mechanics

01:05:18.980 --> 01:05:20.840
to do quantum mechanics,
which doesn't work.

01:05:20.840 --> 01:05:22.180
So I'm not even going
to bother explaining

01:05:22.180 --> 01:05:23.180
what they were thinking.

01:05:23.180 --> 01:05:26.660
But anyway, so people came up
with a sort of classical crutch

01:05:26.660 --> 01:05:29.720
to say, well that's
not totally insane.

01:05:29.720 --> 01:05:31.870
So this is what Zeeman
got, for example,

01:05:31.870 --> 01:05:33.840
by looking at hydrogen.

01:05:33.840 --> 01:05:37.550
But he did more than
just look at hydrogen.

01:05:37.550 --> 01:05:40.385
I can't remember exactly-- I
think he did it with sodium.

01:05:40.385 --> 01:05:42.010
Matt, do you remember?

01:05:42.010 --> 01:05:44.280
I think he did sodium and iron.

01:05:44.280 --> 01:05:45.755
But anyway, here's
the funny thing

01:05:45.755 --> 01:05:47.130
that he got with
sodium and iron.

01:05:47.130 --> 01:05:48.546
So this is a
different experiment.

01:05:48.546 --> 01:05:50.060
It's exactly the
same set up, but he

01:05:50.060 --> 01:05:52.030
was looking at spectral
lines in sodium.

01:05:52.030 --> 01:05:55.130
And spectral lines in sodium
did a very similar thing.

01:05:55.130 --> 01:05:57.450
There were some
where 1 went to 1.

01:06:01.400 --> 01:06:04.520
And there were
others where 1 went

01:06:04.520 --> 01:06:08.546
to-- why did we have three here?

01:06:08.546 --> 01:06:10.920
Just as quick reminder, why
do we have three states here?

01:06:10.920 --> 01:06:12.200
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

01:06:12.200 --> 01:06:14.840
PROFESSOR: Because we have
three states for l equals 1.

01:06:14.840 --> 01:06:25.600
This one state went to one,
two, three, four states,

01:06:25.600 --> 01:06:27.734
with none of them in the middle.

01:06:27.734 --> 01:06:29.150
And in fact, it's
worse than that,

01:06:29.150 --> 01:06:31.108
because they didn't go
to equally spaced states

01:06:31.108 --> 01:06:31.700
in general.

01:06:31.700 --> 01:06:33.650
In general, they did
something slightly funny.

01:06:33.650 --> 01:06:36.690
And the beautiful plot in
his paper looks like this.

01:06:40.130 --> 01:06:44.410
There are four states, and as
you take the magnetic field

01:06:44.410 --> 01:06:47.230
to 0, these four states
all coalesce exactly

01:06:47.230 --> 01:06:49.064
to this one state.

01:06:49.064 --> 01:06:51.355
So this one line is representing
four different states.

01:06:54.000 --> 01:06:56.990
And this already included
the fine structure,

01:06:56.990 --> 01:07:00.535
so we know that this is
all a single value of l.

01:07:00.535 --> 01:07:02.035
But that apparently
has four states.

01:07:07.000 --> 01:07:08.810
That's should worry you.

01:07:08.810 --> 01:07:12.926
What does that tell you about l?

01:07:12.926 --> 01:07:14.550
What does l have to
be in order to have

01:07:14.550 --> 01:07:16.444
four states in your tower?

01:07:16.444 --> 01:07:17.360
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

01:07:17.360 --> 01:07:19.600
PROFESSOR: Half integer--
in particular, what value?

01:07:19.600 --> 01:07:22.830
3/2, crap.

01:07:22.830 --> 01:07:24.790
We already know that
these wave functions

01:07:24.790 --> 01:07:27.090
are described by
the ylm's, right?

01:07:27.090 --> 01:07:28.600
We solved that problem.

01:07:28.600 --> 01:07:29.870
We explicitly solved it.

01:07:29.870 --> 01:07:30.920
Here's the exact answer.

01:07:30.920 --> 01:07:33.246
It's the ylm's.

01:07:33.246 --> 01:07:34.620
But we've observed
experimentally

01:07:34.620 --> 01:07:36.210
that l has to be 3/2.

01:07:36.210 --> 01:07:40.347
But if l is 3/2,
ylm is equal to 0,

01:07:40.347 --> 01:07:41.805
because it's equal
to minus itself.

01:07:45.070 --> 01:07:46.400
This is bad.

01:07:46.400 --> 01:07:47.860
This is 0.

01:07:47.860 --> 01:07:49.840
So this effect is called
the Zeeman effect,

01:07:49.840 --> 01:07:52.743
and this effect is called
the anomalous Zeeman effect.

01:07:52.743 --> 01:07:53.630
[LAUGHTER]

01:07:53.630 --> 01:07:55.300
Which is strange
for two reasons.

01:07:55.300 --> 01:07:57.258
The first reason it's
strange is they showed up

01:07:57.258 --> 01:07:58.312
in the same paper.

01:07:58.312 --> 01:08:00.770
And the second thing is, OK,
you call it the Zeeman effect,

01:08:00.770 --> 01:08:03.110
because there's some
guy named Zeeman.

01:08:03.110 --> 01:08:06.009
Is there some guy
named Anomalous Zeeman?

01:08:06.009 --> 01:08:07.050
It's a very strange name.

01:08:07.050 --> 01:08:09.299
Anyway so this was called
the anomalous Zeeman effect,

01:08:09.299 --> 01:08:12.230
despite appearing in the same
paper, because it's weird.

01:08:12.230 --> 01:08:14.087
It was deeply
disconcerting to people.

01:08:14.087 --> 01:08:15.670
We now just call it
the Zeeman effect,

01:08:15.670 --> 01:08:17.964
but we have the bad habit--
for entertainment value--

01:08:17.964 --> 01:08:20.297
of referring to it still as
the anamolous Zeeman effect.

01:08:20.297 --> 01:08:23.292
I'm not the only one
responsible for that bad habit.

01:08:23.292 --> 01:08:25.750
I'm going to point out that at
the end of this paper-- it's

01:08:25.750 --> 01:08:27.500
a totally awesome
paper, by the way-- it's

01:08:27.500 --> 01:08:29.600
very readable and short--
he says-- I was looking

01:08:29.600 --> 01:08:33.399
at it last night-- it
says, quote possibly

01:08:33.399 --> 01:08:36.580
the observed phenomenon
will be regarded

01:08:36.580 --> 01:08:39.810
as nothing of any consequence.

01:08:39.810 --> 01:08:44.029
OK, so a few years later,
Pauli says the following--

01:08:44.029 --> 01:08:46.319
so Pauli says this,
actually, and this is also

01:08:46.319 --> 01:08:51.410
totally lovely in Science
from 1946 Pauli was in the US

01:08:51.410 --> 01:08:52.170
during the war.

01:08:52.170 --> 01:08:54.674
After the war, he was at the
Institute for Advanced Study.

01:08:54.674 --> 01:08:57.090
At the Institute for Advanced
Studies, while he was there,

01:08:57.090 --> 01:08:58.439
he got the Nobel Prize.

01:08:58.439 --> 01:09:00.744
And he gave-- for the
exclusion principle, which

01:09:00.744 --> 01:09:02.910
we are about to get to--
and he gave a little spiel,

01:09:02.910 --> 01:09:06.310
and it's written up in
this edition of Science.

01:09:06.310 --> 01:09:09.040
And he says, quote,
a colleague who

01:09:09.040 --> 01:09:11.080
met me strolling
rather aimlessly

01:09:11.080 --> 01:09:13.000
in the beautiful
streets of Copenhagen

01:09:13.000 --> 01:09:19.010
said to me in a friendly
manner, "You look very unhappy."

01:09:19.010 --> 01:09:22.910
Whereupon, I responded fiercely,
"How can one look happy

01:09:22.910 --> 01:09:25.686
when he is thinking about
the anamolous Zeeman effect?"

01:09:25.686 --> 01:09:32.500
[LAUGHTER]

01:09:32.500 --> 01:09:33.830
So this troubled people.

01:09:33.830 --> 01:09:34.374
Yeah.

01:09:34.374 --> 01:09:35.290
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

01:09:42.220 --> 01:09:44.389
PROFESSOR: Yeah he found
all sorts of crazy states.

01:09:44.389 --> 01:09:45.680
So this isn't the only example.

01:09:45.680 --> 01:09:47.388
It's just the only
one I'm going to draw.

01:09:47.388 --> 01:09:49.479
But indeed, you can
find five half states

01:09:49.479 --> 01:09:50.967
you can find states with six.

01:09:50.967 --> 01:09:52.050
AUDIENCE: Why [INAUDIBLE]?

01:09:56.787 --> 01:09:58.620
PROFESSOR: Oh, I didn't
draw all the states.

01:09:58.620 --> 01:10:01.078
The spectrum is complicated
and messy, because it's sodium.

01:10:01.078 --> 01:10:02.970
And so there's
all sorts of crap.

01:10:02.970 --> 01:10:04.570
So I'm just not drawing it.

01:10:04.570 --> 01:10:08.370
I'm just focusing on a
specific set of spectral lines.

01:10:08.370 --> 01:10:16.310
Maybe the best way
to draw that is-- OK.

01:10:16.310 --> 01:10:20.540
So this was really troubling.

01:10:20.540 --> 01:10:24.679
So let's put this on
pause for the moment,

01:10:24.679 --> 01:10:26.470
and we'll come back to
it in just a second.

01:10:26.470 --> 01:10:28.010
So meanwhile, there's
something else

01:10:28.010 --> 01:10:29.760
that's sort of annoying
about this system.

01:10:29.760 --> 01:10:34.097
We've got the Coulomb potential,
and the Coulomb potential

01:10:34.097 --> 01:10:35.680
has the following
beautiful property--

01:10:35.680 --> 01:10:41.710
the degeneracy of any energy
state is equal to n squared.

01:10:41.710 --> 01:10:44.410
Meanwhile, various
people were fond

01:10:44.410 --> 01:10:49.550
of observing the fact that
the number of states, which

01:10:49.550 --> 01:10:51.080
I will-- in an
abuse of language--

01:10:51.080 --> 01:10:56.080
call the degeneracy of the
level n in the periodic table,

01:10:56.080 --> 01:10:58.770
is equal to-- well, the
first one there's two.

01:10:58.770 --> 01:11:01.736
And then there's eight,
and then there's 18.

01:11:05.930 --> 01:11:13.180
So two, 8, 8, 18, that's
almost 2n squared.

01:11:15.720 --> 01:11:20.040
Two four 8, 9, 18.

01:11:20.040 --> 01:11:21.870
Cool, maybe there's a
relationship, right?

01:11:21.870 --> 01:11:23.245
And meanwhile,
it's very tempting

01:11:23.245 --> 01:11:25.244
to think there's a
relationship, because imagine

01:11:25.244 --> 01:11:27.012
you have four electrons.

01:11:27.012 --> 01:11:28.970
If you have four electrons,
what you do you do?

01:11:28.970 --> 01:11:30.820
Well, you put an
electron here, and then

01:11:30.820 --> 01:11:32.730
you could put an
electron here, or you

01:11:32.730 --> 01:11:34.357
could put an other
electron here.

01:11:34.357 --> 01:11:36.440
You could also put another
electron here and here.

01:11:36.440 --> 01:11:38.356
Or you could put them
in any combination-- two

01:11:38.356 --> 01:11:40.410
here, put two here,
two here, one,

01:11:40.410 --> 01:11:42.450
one-- you could do all
sorts of stuff, right?

01:11:42.450 --> 01:11:45.990
But if, for the
moment, you imagine

01:11:45.990 --> 01:11:47.722
that electrons have
this funny property.

01:11:47.722 --> 01:11:49.180
Imagine for a moment
that electrons

01:11:49.180 --> 01:11:51.430
have the property that they
can't be in the same state

01:11:51.430 --> 01:11:52.315
at once.

01:11:52.315 --> 01:11:54.440
Then if you have four
electrons-- I don't know why.

01:11:54.440 --> 01:11:55.130
I'm desperate.

01:11:55.130 --> 01:11:56.490
I'm thinking about the
anamolous Zeeman effect,

01:11:56.490 --> 01:11:57.040
among other things.

01:11:57.040 --> 01:11:58.206
I have nothing better to do.

01:11:58.206 --> 01:12:00.560
So just for fun, let's imagine
if I put an elector here,

01:12:00.560 --> 01:12:01.560
I can't put another one.

01:12:01.560 --> 01:12:02.910
So if I have a
two electron atom,

01:12:02.910 --> 01:12:04.360
the second one goes
with one of these.

01:12:04.360 --> 01:12:06.300
A three-electron atom,
a four-electron atom,

01:12:06.300 --> 01:12:07.810
and these guys are all related
to each other, because they

01:12:07.810 --> 01:12:09.212
live in the same
energy level, but they

01:12:09.212 --> 01:12:10.290
have different l
values, so they'll

01:12:10.290 --> 01:12:11.748
have slightly
different properties.

01:12:11.748 --> 01:12:14.950
That suggests that
the one l equals

01:12:14.950 --> 01:12:17.530
0 state should be different
from the 3 l equals 1 states,

01:12:17.530 --> 01:12:18.470
chemically.

01:12:18.470 --> 01:12:21.630
But wait-- there aren't
groupings of one and three.

01:12:21.630 --> 01:12:25.500
They're groupings
of two and six.

01:12:25.500 --> 01:12:32.802
Ah, two-- well, so Pauli
staring at this in 1925

01:12:32.802 --> 01:12:34.260
said the following--
he said, look,

01:12:34.260 --> 01:12:36.180
I'm going to
conjecture two things.

01:12:36.180 --> 01:12:41.000
The first is that
no two electrons

01:12:41.000 --> 01:12:48.190
can live in the same state--
inhabit the same quantum state.

01:12:53.170 --> 01:12:55.570
That doesn't give us the
periodic table, though.

01:12:55.570 --> 01:12:58.060
It gives us half
the periodic table.

01:12:58.060 --> 01:13:12.240
There are twice as many states
in hydrogen as you think.

01:13:15.126 --> 01:13:17.000
And you might think that
I'm being facetious,

01:13:17.000 --> 01:13:19.315
that he said something a
little more sophisticated.

01:13:19.315 --> 01:13:20.190
But he really didn't.

01:13:20.190 --> 01:13:22.020
What he said is, I
posit of the existence

01:13:22.020 --> 01:13:25.060
of an additional quantum number
which the electron can have,

01:13:25.060 --> 01:13:27.840
which takes one of two values.

01:13:27.840 --> 01:13:30.460
Which translated, says, there
are twice as many states

01:13:30.460 --> 01:13:33.309
as you think.

01:13:33.309 --> 01:13:34.600
So that's exactly what he said.

01:13:34.600 --> 01:13:36.740
So this is called the
Pauli exclusion principle.

01:13:36.740 --> 01:13:40.262
And now this does a
totally spectacular thing--

01:13:40.262 --> 01:13:42.720
and you've probably all seen
this in high school chemistry,

01:13:42.720 --> 01:13:44.370
or even college chemistry.

01:13:44.370 --> 01:13:46.579
Now, first electron goes
here, second electron

01:13:46.579 --> 01:13:48.620
goes here, because there
are twice as many states

01:13:48.620 --> 01:13:50.880
as you think, but then I can't
put another state in there,

01:13:50.880 --> 01:13:52.520
because that's as
many as you can have.

01:13:52.520 --> 01:13:55.690
One can go here, and you
can put up to six in here.

01:13:55.690 --> 01:13:56.340
And that's it.

01:13:56.340 --> 01:14:01.840
So the E2 states, the n squared,
which is 4 times 2 states,

01:14:01.840 --> 01:14:03.940
are somehow related to
each other naturally.

01:14:03.940 --> 01:14:05.920
And this gives you the
structure of the periodic table.

01:14:05.920 --> 01:14:07.336
In fact, an awful
lot of chemistry

01:14:07.336 --> 01:14:08.480
follows directly from this.

01:14:08.480 --> 01:14:10.188
So this is the Pauli
exclusion principle.

01:14:10.188 --> 01:14:12.430
However, it's a little
bit disappointing,

01:14:12.430 --> 01:14:14.980
because while this is
whatever-- some ridiculous rule,

01:14:14.980 --> 01:14:16.354
but we're doing
quantum mechanics

01:14:16.354 --> 01:14:18.800
and they're all
ridiculous rules.

01:14:18.800 --> 01:14:20.730
On the other hand, this
one is just stupid.

01:14:20.730 --> 01:14:21.230
Right?

01:14:21.230 --> 01:14:24.890
This is just, like, look,
it wouldn't it be nice?

01:14:24.890 --> 01:14:31.520
So in '25, a couple guys--
really interesting characters--

01:14:31.520 --> 01:14:37.739
named Goudsmit and Uhlenbeck--
so Uhlenbeck-- wow,

01:14:37.739 --> 01:14:38.780
we're really low on time.

01:14:38.780 --> 01:14:41.100
OK, so I'll just tell
you this, and then I'll

01:14:41.100 --> 01:14:43.320
get to the last of it later.

01:14:43.320 --> 01:14:48.310
So Goudsmit and Uhlenbeck--
who were young, kind of naive--

01:14:48.310 --> 01:14:51.310
said, look we've got
two effects here.

01:14:51.310 --> 01:14:54.110
One effect is the
anamolous Zeeman effect,

01:14:54.110 --> 01:14:56.380
and there's this
weird fact that states

01:14:56.380 --> 01:14:58.335
have the wrong total
angular momentum.

01:14:58.335 --> 01:15:00.460
And we have this second
thing, that there are twice

01:15:00.460 --> 01:15:02.250
as many states for
an electron as you

01:15:02.250 --> 01:15:04.410
think in the Coulomb potential.

01:15:04.410 --> 01:15:07.490
How can these two things
fit together naturally?

01:15:07.490 --> 01:15:10.060
Well here's a guess--
suppose that the angular

01:15:10.060 --> 01:15:12.390
momentum that we
calculated when we

01:15:12.390 --> 01:15:17.569
did the estimate of the braking
due to the Zeeman effect,

01:15:17.569 --> 01:15:19.860
suppose that angular momentum
was not the right angular

01:15:19.860 --> 01:15:20.310
momentum.

01:15:20.310 --> 01:15:22.130
Maybe there's more angular
momentum in the system.

01:15:22.130 --> 01:15:23.670
There's angular momentum in
the system from the electron

01:15:23.670 --> 01:15:25.878
orbiting around, but maybe
like a little, tiny Earth,

01:15:25.878 --> 01:15:28.180
the electron itself can
have some intrinsic angular

01:15:28.180 --> 01:15:29.347
momentum.

01:15:29.347 --> 01:15:31.180
It turns out Pauli had
had this idea before.

01:15:31.180 --> 01:15:32.640
In fact, Kramers
had suggested this

01:15:32.640 --> 01:15:35.800
to him, who was a very
young guy at the time.

01:15:35.800 --> 01:15:37.660
And Pauli said, you're
a blithering idiot,

01:15:37.660 --> 01:15:39.490
because if you calculate
how small an electron has

01:15:39.490 --> 01:15:41.410
to be in order to fit all the
other things we know, and you

01:15:41.410 --> 01:15:43.370
figure out how fast it would
have to rotate to explain

01:15:43.370 --> 01:15:44.840
the anamolous Zeeman
effect, the surface

01:15:44.840 --> 01:15:46.990
would have to be moving
faster the speed of light.

01:15:46.990 --> 01:15:48.110
That's ridiculous.

01:15:48.110 --> 01:15:49.630
Leave my office.

01:15:49.630 --> 01:15:58.750
So then Uhlenbeck and Goudsmit--
these two guys-- write a paper,

01:15:58.750 --> 01:15:59.440
and say aha!

01:15:59.440 --> 01:16:01.350
Well, we can explain
this, but let's just not

01:16:01.350 --> 01:16:02.980
assume that the stupid
thing is rotating.

01:16:02.980 --> 01:16:04.810
Let's just say an electron
has some intrinsic angular

01:16:04.810 --> 01:16:05.630
momentum.

01:16:05.630 --> 01:16:07.650
I don't know, why not?

01:16:07.650 --> 01:16:09.400
Electrons have intrinsic
angular momentum,

01:16:09.400 --> 01:16:12.370
and if you assume that electrons
have an intrinsic angular

01:16:12.370 --> 01:16:16.880
momentum-- which I'll call
S for the moment-- so then

01:16:16.880 --> 01:16:18.390
the total angular
momentum, j, is

01:16:18.390 --> 01:16:21.320
equal to l, its orbital
angular momentum,

01:16:21.320 --> 01:16:23.420
plus some intrinsic
angular momentum, which--

01:16:23.420 --> 01:16:25.795
I don't remember what symbol
they used, but we'll call it

01:16:25.795 --> 01:16:28.040
for the moment S-- where
this has the property that S

01:16:28.040 --> 01:16:34.480
squared, for an electron,
sorry, the principle quantum

01:16:34.480 --> 01:16:37.040
number, which I will call
little s is equal to 1/2,

01:16:37.040 --> 01:16:41.214
so m sub s is equal
to plus or minus 1/2.

01:16:41.214 --> 01:16:43.505
So this is like the l equals
1/2 state, but it's not l.

01:16:43.505 --> 01:16:44.546
It's something intrinsic.

01:16:44.546 --> 01:16:46.730
It has nothing to do
with anything rotating.

01:16:46.730 --> 01:16:48.357
It's just a fact
about electrons.

01:16:48.357 --> 01:16:50.190
Suppose electrons have
a little bit of spin.

01:16:50.190 --> 01:16:53.390
Then what you discover is if
you have the l equals 1 state,

01:16:53.390 --> 01:16:55.280
and the electron
has spin 1/2, what's

01:16:55.280 --> 01:16:57.720
the total angular momentum?

01:16:57.720 --> 01:17:00.769
3/2, right?

01:17:00.769 --> 01:17:01.560
So what do you get?

01:17:01.560 --> 01:17:05.755
You get quadruplets, like that.

01:17:05.755 --> 01:17:07.630
So this turns out to
explain-- if you include

01:17:07.630 --> 01:17:09.463
a small relativistic
effect-- this turns out

01:17:09.463 --> 01:17:14.720
to explain the anomalous
Zeeman effect bang on.

01:17:14.720 --> 01:17:16.640
Meanwhile, there
was an experiment

01:17:16.640 --> 01:17:19.210
done in 1922, which is the
Stern-Gerlach experiment,

01:17:19.210 --> 01:17:23.080
in which Stern and Gerlach
discovered that nickel, when

01:17:23.080 --> 01:17:25.315
sent through a magnetic
field gradient,

01:17:25.315 --> 01:17:28.600
bent into one of two
different spots-- never three,

01:17:28.600 --> 01:17:31.110
never zero, always two.

01:17:31.110 --> 01:17:33.040
How can that be?

01:17:33.040 --> 01:17:35.410
Electron spin-- that
wasn't realized until 1929,

01:17:35.410 --> 01:17:37.130
that the connection was there.

01:17:37.130 --> 01:17:41.870
So these guys came up with
this ridiculous postulate.

01:17:41.870 --> 01:17:43.560
This was Uhlenbeck and Goudsmit.

01:17:43.560 --> 01:17:49.460
And let me just quickly--
U-H-L-E-N-B-E-C-K--

01:17:49.460 --> 01:17:51.610
so Uhlenbeck-- amazing,
amazing scientist,

01:17:51.610 --> 01:17:55.390
also the father of the
mathematician Uhlenbeck,

01:17:55.390 --> 01:17:58.140
and she was a total badass,
and has inspired an awful lot

01:17:58.140 --> 01:18:02.259
of physics-- Karen
Uhlenbeck, who's at UT.

01:18:02.259 --> 01:18:04.300
So this is a pretty
interesting and prolific guy.

01:18:04.300 --> 01:18:06.350
But he was also prolific
in the following way--

01:18:06.350 --> 01:18:10.540
he ran a program at the Rad
Lab at MIT during World War II.

01:18:10.540 --> 01:18:12.740
And Goudsmit worked with him.

01:18:12.740 --> 01:18:15.476
And when they were finishing
up, when the war was ending,

01:18:15.476 --> 01:18:17.600
Goudsmit became the scientific
adviser to something

01:18:17.600 --> 01:18:20.140
called Project Alsos.

01:18:20.140 --> 01:18:22.780
Project Alsos was a project
where the military went

01:18:22.780 --> 01:18:25.230
to the conquered
territories in Germany

01:18:25.230 --> 01:18:27.870
to catch the German
atomic scientists,

01:18:27.870 --> 01:18:30.710
and bring them to a
place called Farm Hall

01:18:30.710 --> 01:18:34.190
in England, where they listened
and eavesdropped on them--

01:18:34.190 --> 01:18:37.820
Heisenberg, all the good guys.

01:18:37.820 --> 01:18:40.420
Well, bad guys-- it depends
on-- all the great physicist

01:18:40.420 --> 01:18:42.000
in the German
territory at the time

01:18:42.000 --> 01:18:44.360
were deeply complicated people.

01:18:44.360 --> 01:18:45.500
And they listened to them.

01:18:45.500 --> 01:18:47.300
Something called the
Farm Hall Transcripts

01:18:47.300 --> 01:18:49.470
are the transcripts
of those recordings.

01:18:49.470 --> 01:18:52.684
They were written up in a book
called "The Epsilon Project,"

01:18:52.684 --> 01:18:54.350
which is totally
breathtakingly awesome.

01:18:54.350 --> 01:18:57.580
And Goudsmit wrote a
book called "Alsos"

01:18:57.580 --> 01:19:01.240
about this process of hunting
down the German scientists.

01:19:01.240 --> 01:19:07.390
So Goudsmit,
G-O-U-D-S-M-I-T, I think,

01:19:07.390 --> 01:19:09.900
he wrote a book called "Alsos",
which I heartily recommend

01:19:09.900 --> 01:19:12.530
to you, because it's like a
combination adventure story

01:19:12.530 --> 01:19:15.020
and beautiful bit
of physics history.

01:19:15.020 --> 01:19:18.020
So these guys both were at
MIT during the World War.

01:19:18.020 --> 01:19:19.720
So there's a nice
connection here.

01:19:19.720 --> 01:19:21.360
So these guys--
fascinating characters,

01:19:21.360 --> 01:19:23.050
and they came up with this
idea of some intrinsic angular

01:19:23.050 --> 01:19:23.740
momentum.

01:19:23.740 --> 01:19:27.926
Pauli then calls it spin.

01:19:27.926 --> 01:19:28.800
He gives it the name.

01:19:28.800 --> 01:19:32.590
And he develops a
mathematical theory of spin.

01:19:32.590 --> 01:19:34.220
And the mathematical
theory of spin

01:19:34.220 --> 01:19:36.680
will lead to quantum field
theory, relativistic quantum

01:19:36.680 --> 01:19:38.380
mechanics, and will
eventually lead

01:19:38.380 --> 01:19:40.040
to quantum computation,
which is going

01:19:40.040 --> 01:19:42.074
to be the topic of the
last week of our course.

01:19:42.074 --> 01:19:43.490
So what we've done
so far is we've

01:19:43.490 --> 01:19:46.610
explained the discreteness
of atomic spectra,

01:19:46.610 --> 01:19:48.140
and we've explained
the structure

01:19:48.140 --> 01:19:49.422
of the periodic table.

01:19:49.422 --> 01:19:50.880
What we haven't
done, is we haven't

01:19:50.880 --> 01:19:54.200
explained why atoms form
molecules or solids.

01:19:54.200 --> 01:19:56.890
And we also haven't explained
what spin is at all.

01:19:56.890 --> 01:19:59.150
Those are the topics in
the next three weeks.

01:19:59.150 --> 01:20:01.110
See you next time.
