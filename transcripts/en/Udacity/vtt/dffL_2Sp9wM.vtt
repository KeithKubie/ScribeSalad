00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.190
Now here, just because the fact 3 approximation algorithm

00:00:03.190 --> 00:00:06.110
for vertex cover doesn't carry over here

00:00:06.110 --> 00:00:08.660
doesn't mean doesn't mean there can not be an approximation algorithm

00:00:08.660 --> 00:00:10.780
for Clique and Independent Set;

00:00:10.780 --> 00:00:12.580
it's just that we can not use this one.

00:00:12.580 --> 00:00:14.940
So Bob and Carol still don't have to be unhappy,

00:00:14.940 --> 00:00:19.070
but unfortunately, I'm now going to make them very unhappy.

00:00:19.070 --> 00:00:21.290
For Clique and Independent set,

00:00:21.290 --> 00:00:24.400
there is no constant factor approximation algorithm

00:00:24.400 --> 00:00:26.740
unless P equals NP.

00:00:26.740 --> 00:00:30.720
That, of course, is a very unpleasant surprise

00:00:30.720 --> 00:00:32.350
and it's very surprising,

00:00:32.350 --> 00:00:34.340
so where did I get that from?

00:00:34.340 --> 00:00:36.220
Well, the proof for this result here

00:00:36.220 --> 00:00:38.850
relies on some very, very deep results

00:00:38.850 --> 00:00:40.870
of theoretical computer science

00:00:40.870 --> 00:00:44.300
which you will only get to know in very advanced

00:00:44.300 --> 00:00:47.010
theoretical computer science courses, if ever.

00:00:47.010 --> 00:00:50.060
But what I would like to do is just give you an intuitive idea

00:00:50.060 --> 00:00:53.790
for why there is no constant factor approximation algorithm

00:00:53.790 --> 00:00:55.570
for Clique and Independent Set

00:00:55.570 --> 99:59:59.000
unless P equals NP.
