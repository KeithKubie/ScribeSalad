00:00:00.300 --> 00:00:02.900
♫Why does everybody keep on hiring me?♫

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:06.000
♫All of my work is shiiiiiit.♫

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:09.640
Hellooo, I'm the Nostalgia Critic.

00:00:09.680 --> 00:00:11.540
I remember so YOU don't have to.

00:00:11.540 --> 00:00:16.780
Well, seeing as how we just started Shyamalan month it only figures to ask the question

00:00:16.920 --> 00:00:18.840
How do good directors go bad?

00:00:19.400 --> 00:00:23.100
Yes it's easy to point at Shyamalan as a prime example of this

00:00:23.120 --> 00:00:25.520
seeing how one of his earliest films, The Sixth Sense

00:00:25.520 --> 00:00:29.880
was a huge, huge hit and his movies got increasingly worse after

00:00:29.880 --> 00:00:31.420
but what about the others?

00:00:31.420 --> 00:00:32.900
You know who I'm talking about.

00:00:32.900 --> 00:00:35.060
Directors that even today are praised

00:00:35.060 --> 00:00:37.900
as maverick game changers, but many people feel have

00:00:37.900 --> 00:00:39.860
lost their touch in later years.

00:00:39.860 --> 00:00:42.000
Is it just an inevitable part in getting older?

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:45.400
Are all artists doomed to fail if they stay around too long?

00:00:45.460 --> 00:00:48.680
It's a question a lot of people who love movies have been asking for years.

00:00:48.680 --> 00:00:51.680
Well the best way to look at this is probably in groups.

00:00:51.680 --> 00:00:55.300
So lets start off by looking at the group you most likely want to hear the most about

00:00:55.300 --> 00:00:57.500
The ones that went completely down hill.

00:00:57.840 --> 00:01:01.340
The Shyamalans, the George Lucases, the Wachowskis.

00:01:01.340 --> 00:01:04.100
The directors that we thought were going to change the world

00:01:04.100 --> 00:01:07.440
but then somewhere down the line went completely south.

00:01:07.440 --> 00:01:09.460
What do all these directors have in common?

00:01:09.460 --> 00:01:11.520
Well, a couple of things surprisingly.

00:01:12.100 --> 00:01:15.600
All of them, we declared, were gonna keep making great things.

00:01:15.600 --> 00:01:17.500
If that one thing they made was amazing,

00:01:17.500 --> 00:01:21.500
surely all the other ones afterwards will be just as amazing if not greater.

00:01:21.760 --> 00:01:25.620
Writer Ralph Ellison wrote a novel called Invisible Man in 1952.

00:01:26.060 --> 00:01:28.880
It was so good and so praised by everyone around him

00:01:28.880 --> 00:01:31.160
that he never wrote another novel again.

00:01:31.580 --> 00:01:33.080
He became a perfectionist

00:01:33.080 --> 00:01:35.260
and the pressure of following up such a masterwork

00:01:35.260 --> 00:01:38.120
intimidated him so much that he never released another one.

00:01:38.640 --> 00:01:41.080
That's just one example of how certain attention can get

00:01:41.080 --> 00:01:42.200
in the way of good progress.

00:01:42.900 --> 00:01:46.020
When George Lucas made "Star Wars", people were blown away.

00:01:46.020 --> 00:01:49.760
Saying it would change film forever and in some respects it did.

00:01:49.960 --> 00:01:53.720
Every big blockbuster is trying to do what Star Wars did.

00:01:53.720 --> 00:01:56.760
Whether in style or the amount of people they're trying to attract.

00:01:56.980 --> 00:01:59.640
But if you look at a lot of the deleted scenes and original scripts,

00:01:59.640 --> 00:02:04.200
you'll find that a lot of it was very similar to the now despised prequels.

00:02:04.740 --> 00:02:06.200
There were a lot of political talks.

00:02:06.200 --> 00:02:07.520
There were a lot of pointless scenes.

00:02:08.160 --> 00:02:10.500
And admit it, some of the dialogue has an eerie

00:02:10.500 --> 00:02:13.620
corny-ness of what was to come years later.

00:02:13.960 --> 00:02:17.300
"I recognized your foul stench when I was brought on board."

00:02:17.300 --> 00:02:18.900
Couldn't you just hear that alongside...

00:02:19.160 --> 00:02:22.520
"Either choice presents great danger, to us all."

00:02:22.520 --> 00:02:25.780
But one of the things was he had people giving him advice.

00:02:25.780 --> 00:02:28.420
Telling him what would probably work and what wouldn't.

00:02:28.420 --> 00:02:31.380
He wasn't a star yet and a lot was riding on this film.

00:02:31.620 --> 00:02:32.900
So, why not listen?

00:02:32.900 --> 00:02:36.340
This is possibly what helped make this movie such a big game-changer.

00:02:36.340 --> 00:02:38.760
But even early on, the signs were there.

00:02:38.880 --> 00:02:41.520
After the first run of the film, Lucas immediately went

00:02:41.520 --> 00:02:44.040
back and put episode four in the opening scroll.

00:02:44.280 --> 00:02:46.740
So as much as people like to say he's changing things

00:02:46.740 --> 00:02:48.440
in altering the film's only recently,

00:02:48.440 --> 00:02:50.940
they were done when they were first shown.

00:02:50.940 --> 00:02:54.160
and remember that Empire and Jedi were not directed by him.

00:02:54.160 --> 00:02:56.340
and the scenes that people have the most problems with

00:02:56.340 --> 00:02:58.400
are usually the ones he pushed the heaviest.

00:02:58.940 --> 00:03:00.980
So, years of not directing a film,

00:03:00.980 --> 00:03:02.980
not doing that much story-telling,

00:03:02.980 --> 00:03:04.740
and nobody talking against him

00:03:04.740 --> 00:03:06.580
but instead praising him as a genius.

00:03:07.020 --> 00:03:09.820
Can we really be shocked we got what we got?

00:03:10.300 --> 00:03:13.460
History repeated itself almost identically with the Matrix movies.

00:03:14.300 --> 00:03:17.440
The Wachowskis started off with a pretty damn good first movie.

00:03:17.440 --> 00:03:21.120
But then hit mega-blockbuster status when they directed "The Matrix".

00:03:21.120 --> 00:03:23.460
Much like "Star Wars", it had ground-breaking effects,

00:03:23.460 --> 00:03:24.620
an interesting style,

00:03:24.620 --> 00:03:27.820
and an environment that allowed for a lot of interpretation.

00:03:28.140 --> 00:03:30.780
So, knowing Hollywood, what happened?

00:03:30.780 --> 00:03:32.660
The exact same thing except faster.

00:03:33.140 --> 00:03:35.360
They wanted two more Matrix movies.

00:03:35.360 --> 00:03:36.960
Bigger and better than the original.

00:03:36.960 --> 00:03:39.380
Telling the Wachowskis to do whatever they wanted.

00:03:39.660 --> 00:03:41.020
But, as we learned with Lucas,

00:03:41.020 --> 00:03:43.660
doing whatever you want isn't always the answer.

00:03:43.660 --> 00:03:46.840
The Wachowskis also had to take advise on their first movie

00:03:47.020 --> 00:03:48.600
and as I pointed out in my review,

00:03:48.600 --> 00:03:51.020
it's not the like the writing was exactly perfect.

00:03:51.460 --> 00:03:53.140
"You're my savior man...

00:03:53.140 --> 00:03:55.220
my own personal Jesus Christ."

00:03:55.380 --> 00:03:55.940
Subtle.

00:03:56.900 --> 00:04:00.040
But now imagine that writing with nobody advising them

00:04:00.040 --> 00:04:03.560
and instead a fan base praising that, "Their words are incredible

00:04:03.680 --> 00:04:05.880
I get lost in how deep they are."

00:04:05.880 --> 00:04:08.500
Like Lucas, the following movies reflected that.

00:04:08.500 --> 00:04:11.340
Trying to make the world seem more vast and meaningful

00:04:11.340 --> 00:04:13.520
while forgetting to focus on basic essentials

00:04:13.520 --> 00:04:15.920
like enjoyable characters or a coherent story.

00:04:16.500 --> 00:04:19.140
But think about it, if you were a writer or director in that

00:04:19.140 --> 00:04:21.800
situation, wouldn't that possibly happen to you too?

00:04:22.600 --> 00:04:25.260
Even directors that are still popular, like Christopher Nolan.

00:04:25.260 --> 00:04:28.060
It's totally understandable how people can still like his work,

00:04:28.060 --> 00:04:31.440
but even his strongest fans are starting to notice a little repeat.

00:04:32.020 --> 00:04:35.040
A lot of philosophical talk, resulting in a very long

00:04:35.040 --> 00:04:38.040
running-time, leading to a super complicated story.

00:04:38.240 --> 00:04:41.080
Now these are criticisms that have always been in his movies.

00:04:41.080 --> 00:04:41.580
All of 'em

00:04:41.780 --> 00:04:42.420
Memento

00:04:42.620 --> 00:04:43.180
Batman Begins

00:04:43.660 --> 00:04:44.380
Inception

00:04:44.380 --> 00:04:46.920
These films had very similar patterns.

00:04:46.920 --> 00:04:49.580
Some claim it's the same thing over and over and they're sick of it.

00:04:49.580 --> 00:04:52.920
Others claim that it doesn't matter because he just does it so well.

00:04:53.000 --> 00:04:55.960
But everybody agrees, they've seen it a lot.

00:04:56.340 --> 00:05:00.600
The point is, sometimes it's not giving us something different that's a noticeable problem.

00:05:00.600 --> 00:05:02.860
Sometimes it's just giving us the exact same thing.

00:05:03.420 --> 00:05:06.540
But not all directors are given almost complete creative freedom.

00:05:06.540 --> 00:05:09.640
Look at horror directors like John Carpenter and the late Wes Craven.

00:05:09.640 --> 00:05:12.940
Both of them started off with creative ideas and promising careers

00:05:12.940 --> 00:05:15.700
but somewhere they started to feel a little stale.

00:05:15.700 --> 00:05:19.220
After Halloween, John Carpenter directed almost a movie a year

00:05:19.220 --> 00:05:21.260
and most of them were awesome and badass.

00:05:21.320 --> 00:05:23.360
But then they started to go on repeat.

00:05:23.420 --> 00:05:26.380
We were seeing stuff we thought we saw before

00:05:26.380 --> 00:05:27.860
except not as innovative.

00:05:27.860 --> 00:05:31.820
He basically left directing and instead soaks up the praise of his past projects.

00:05:31.820 --> 00:05:34.580
Which, given his age and how much cool stuff he's done,

00:05:34.580 --> 00:05:36.100
that seems fitting enough.

00:05:36.380 --> 00:05:39.160
But as much as people praise Wes Craven after his passing,

00:05:39.160 --> 00:05:42.560
they usually forget he's kinda been on the decline for years as well.

00:05:42.560 --> 00:05:44.840
Sure, we know him for his early work,

00:05:44.840 --> 00:05:46.400
but aside from the "Scream" movies,

00:05:46.400 --> 00:05:48.420
which even mocked itself in how lame it was getting.

00:05:48.660 --> 00:05:52.180
He hasn't made that many films that people remember.

00:05:52.960 --> 00:05:56.020
One of the reasons may be, Wes Craven didn't want to do horror.

00:05:56.440 --> 00:06:00.280
Ever notice a few romantic films snuck their way in there?

00:06:00.280 --> 00:06:02.820
That's because he always wanted to do love stories.

00:06:02.820 --> 00:06:05.080
But after the success of his scary films,

00:06:05.080 --> 00:06:07.680
he was labeled as the master of horror for a while

00:06:07.680 --> 00:06:09.820
and that seemed to be what kept him popular,

00:06:09.820 --> 00:06:11.860
as well as continue to get him work.

00:06:12.080 --> 00:06:14.380
He even made fun of this in "Scream 3" when the director

00:06:14.380 --> 00:06:16.380
admits he doesn't even like doing horror films

00:06:16.380 --> 00:06:18.300
and instead wanted to do romances.

00:06:18.560 --> 00:06:20.000
He managed to get one or two in there.

00:06:20.000 --> 00:06:22.000
But can we really be shocked that not all

00:06:22.000 --> 00:06:23.740
his scary movies are masterpieces

00:06:23.740 --> 00:06:25.920
when it wasn't even his original intent?

00:06:26.260 --> 00:06:28.520
There is also a group of directors that don't make that

00:06:28.520 --> 00:06:31.720
many good movies because they don't make that many movies in general.

00:06:32.340 --> 00:06:36.640
The legendary Francis Ford Coppola clearly just kinda directs whatever he wants.

00:06:36.640 --> 00:06:38.440
We all know him for the "Godfather"" films

00:06:38.440 --> 00:06:39.620
and "Apocalypse Now".

00:06:39.620 --> 00:06:42.740
But did you know he also directed "Captain EO"?

00:06:42.740 --> 00:06:44.220
Or "Faerie Tale Theatre"?

00:06:44.220 --> 00:06:45.900
Or "Peggy Sue Got Married"?

00:06:45.900 --> 00:06:46.540
Or "Jack"?

00:06:46.840 --> 00:06:48.020
Whether you like these or not,

00:06:48.020 --> 00:06:49.820
you have to admit, these are rather

00:06:49.820 --> 00:06:51.960
strange choices for a guy like this.

00:06:52.320 --> 00:06:55.920
But part of that is understandable because he's been busy with other stuff.

00:06:55.920 --> 00:06:59.000
From producing, to theatre work, to friggin' wine making,

00:06:59.000 --> 00:07:01.240
he seems like a guy who likes to do a lot,

00:07:01.240 --> 00:07:02.760
just not all in one field.

00:07:02.760 --> 00:07:06.120
But when you do that, the chances of making constantly good films

00:07:06.140 --> 00:07:09.740
are usually lessened as you're simply not making them as much.

00:07:09.740 --> 00:07:12.240
But then again, if he's happy, he's happy.

00:07:12.540 --> 00:07:14.500
Who says he has to keep making films to appease us?

00:07:14.500 --> 00:07:17.340
William Friedkin went from directing something every year

00:07:17.360 --> 00:07:18.800
to every three years.

00:07:18.800 --> 00:07:21.580
And half the time it wasn't even movies, it was T.V.

00:07:21.920 --> 00:07:25.040
And even then the choices were usually very odd

00:07:25.040 --> 00:07:27.180
and not winning over that many critics or audiences.

00:07:27.180 --> 00:07:29.860
But to his credit, it was those bizarre choices

00:07:29.860 --> 00:07:31.300
that gave us masterpieces

00:07:31.300 --> 00:07:32.460
like "The Exorcist".

00:07:32.460 --> 00:07:33.560
or "Live and Die in L.A."

00:07:33.620 --> 00:07:34.500
and so forth.

00:07:34.500 --> 00:07:38.400
Sometimes that weird style can peak at just the right time.

00:07:38.400 --> 00:07:41.840
But then, not really be ready for a different generation.

00:07:42.100 --> 00:07:42.840
"Bug" for example,

00:07:42.840 --> 00:07:45.660
a film about a couple going crazy from paranoia,

00:07:45.660 --> 00:07:47.340
woulda' worked great in the 70s

00:07:47.340 --> 00:07:50.700
but today, most audiences just find it annoying and confusing.

00:07:51.120 --> 00:07:52.500
Neither opinion is right or wrong,

00:07:52.500 --> 00:07:55.860
but timing is everything when it comes to making popular art.

00:07:56.700 --> 00:07:59.620
Which comes to the next group of directors you see quite often,

00:07:59.620 --> 00:08:01.280
the hit or miss directors.

00:08:01.800 --> 00:08:03.920
These are the directors who used to make nothing but hits

00:08:03.920 --> 00:08:06.340
but suddenly make misses that are so bad

00:08:06.340 --> 00:08:09.620
you can't possibly believe they were from the same person.

00:08:09.640 --> 00:08:12.160
Tim Burton used to be a unique visionary

00:08:12.160 --> 00:08:14.340
with "Ed Wood", "Batman", and "Edward Scissorhands".

00:08:14.340 --> 00:08:17.280
But then films like "Mars Attacks", "Dark Shadows",

00:08:17.280 --> 00:08:19.680
and "Planet of the Apes" are part of his lineup too.

00:08:20.080 --> 00:08:23.360
Ang Lee was well known for losing his path in a big way once in a while.

00:08:23.680 --> 00:08:25.420
Gus Van Sant seems to go back-and-forth

00:08:25.420 --> 00:08:28.720
between making annoyingly-unfocused art house experiments

00:08:28.720 --> 00:08:31.180
and reasonably good films at the same time.

00:08:31.600 --> 00:08:34.860
Robert Zemeckis walks the tightrope both literally and figuratively

00:08:34.860 --> 00:08:37.200
with giants like "Back to the Future",

00:08:37.200 --> 00:08:38.480
and "Roger Rabbit".

00:08:38.480 --> 00:08:40.180
But then backfires with "What Lies Beneath"

00:08:40.180 --> 00:08:41.000
and "Contact".

00:08:41.600 --> 00:08:44.500
Robert Rodriguez is amazing in how back-and-forth he

00:08:44.500 --> 00:08:47.340
goes with the likability or hateability of his movies.

00:08:47.840 --> 00:08:50.000
Most recently we've seen Ridley Scott practically

00:08:50.000 --> 00:08:52.640
lampoon his own style with "Robin Hood"

00:08:52.740 --> 00:08:54.020
and "Prometheus".

00:08:54.020 --> 00:08:57.520
But in one film win back everybody with "The Martian".

00:08:57.520 --> 00:08:59.400
What do all these directors have in common?

00:08:59.400 --> 00:09:02.060
Well, they all have pretty extreme styles.

00:09:02.800 --> 00:09:04.220
As much as we love extremes,

00:09:04.220 --> 00:09:06.980
people forget they can just as easily backfire

00:09:06.980 --> 00:09:08.180
as hit bulls-eyes.

00:09:08.540 --> 00:09:10.180
The style of these film-makers though,

00:09:10.180 --> 00:09:12.360
seems to be just relateable enough that

00:09:12.360 --> 00:09:14.260
even when they do make a big miss,

00:09:14.260 --> 00:09:16.560
we're still willing to jump right back on

00:09:16.560 --> 00:09:19.940
because they can still make a connection with us that seems timeless.

00:09:20.400 --> 00:09:23.440
It's hard to say what the secret is that keeps us coming back to them,

00:09:23.440 --> 00:09:26.120
but all of them have it in their own unique way.

00:09:26.800 --> 00:09:29.140
Which brings us to the most impressive group of

00:09:29.140 --> 00:09:30.520
directors who have gone bad,

00:09:30.520 --> 00:09:32.660
the ones who come back.

00:09:32.940 --> 00:09:36.180
Remember when the Cohen brothers made a long line of bad films?

00:09:36.540 --> 00:09:38.900
They returned to pleasing us and as strange as ever.

00:09:38.900 --> 00:09:41.420
Remember when Woody Allen suffered an embarassing personal life

00:09:41.420 --> 00:09:43.340
as well as creative life?

00:09:43.340 --> 00:09:47.420
He retaliated with intelligent comedies that even had a hint of magic to them.

00:09:47.820 --> 00:09:49.800
Barry Sonnenfeld was making bomb after bomb

00:09:49.800 --> 00:09:51.560
but then he made "Men in Black 3".

00:09:51.560 --> 00:09:54.620
The surprising sequel that nobody knew they wanted.

00:09:54.620 --> 00:09:58.300
Master film-makers like Stephen Spielberg and Martin Scorsese.

00:09:58.300 --> 00:10:00.980
Both giants of cinema in their own unique way

00:10:00.980 --> 00:10:04.000
veered into a long stream of disappointment.

00:10:04.000 --> 00:10:07.560
But found themselves making great work again in completely new ways.

00:10:08.240 --> 00:10:08.800
And yes,

00:10:08.800 --> 00:10:11.680
even Shyamalan has made a little bit of a comeback

00:10:11.680 --> 00:10:12.880
with "The Visit".

00:10:12.880 --> 00:10:15.240
Getting both critical and box office praise.

00:10:15.620 --> 00:10:17.440
These are directors that started off strong,

00:10:17.440 --> 00:10:19.040
veered into dark paths,

00:10:19.040 --> 00:10:22.220
and then seemingly came out creatively rejuvenated.

00:10:22.360 --> 00:10:24.040
Did they just need time to heal?

00:10:24.040 --> 00:10:26.520
Did they need to try something new to discover the old ways?

00:10:26.520 --> 00:10:28.600
Or were the old ways getting in the way of something new?

00:10:29.100 --> 00:10:31.340
Honestly, we can't know for sure,

00:10:31.340 --> 00:10:32.540
and it's all subjective.

00:10:32.540 --> 00:10:34.540
Really this is just speculation.

00:10:35.260 --> 00:10:38.240
We can't know for sure what's going on behind the scenes

00:10:38.240 --> 00:10:41.140
any more than we can know what's going on inside somebody's head.

00:10:41.240 --> 00:10:44.760
Everything listed here are possibilities that seem likely

00:10:44.760 --> 00:10:46.120
but aren't certain.

00:10:46.120 --> 00:10:47.600
I guess what I'm trying to get to is that

00:10:47.600 --> 00:10:50.920
there's no perfect way to make continually great art.

00:10:50.920 --> 00:10:53.500
Everyone's gonna have their ups and downs.

00:10:53.500 --> 00:10:54.580
Some stay down,

00:10:54.580 --> 00:10:55.940
others come back up,

00:10:55.940 --> 00:10:57.500
and many hover somewhere in between.

00:10:57.920 --> 00:11:00.760
With film-making requiring as many people as it does,

00:11:00.760 --> 00:11:04.020
there's no one method that's proven to always work.

00:11:04.280 --> 00:11:06.180
Sometimes the studio gets in the way,

00:11:06.180 --> 00:11:07.940
other times they save a movie.

00:11:08.140 --> 00:11:10.420
Sometimes an artist should be allowed to do whatever they want,

00:11:10.420 --> 00:11:12.440
other times they need more restraint.

00:11:12.940 --> 00:11:16.620
You can never know for sure but honestly, that's what makes art so exciting.

00:11:17.400 --> 00:11:19.000
There is no one answer.

00:11:19.000 --> 00:11:22.340
It can come from any style, anywhere, from anyone.

00:11:22.860 --> 00:11:25.900
Will Shyamalan ride the success of "The Visit" into better work?

00:11:25.900 --> 00:11:27.960
Or was it just a lucky shot in the dark?

00:11:28.220 --> 00:11:30.460
Nobody knows and thank God for it.

00:11:30.460 --> 00:11:33.200
The unpredictability of what a product is going to do

00:11:33.200 --> 00:11:35.220
is part of what makes it so thrilling.

00:11:35.220 --> 00:11:37.520
A well-known director can make crap

00:11:37.520 --> 00:11:39.380
and a well-known bad director can make gold.

00:11:39.620 --> 00:11:43.380
So just remember, when it comes to art, there is no certainty

00:11:43.540 --> 00:11:45.100
and you don't have all the answers,

00:11:45.100 --> 00:11:45.980
none of us do.

00:11:46.460 --> 00:11:48.580
It's just interesting to speculate and guess

00:11:48.580 --> 00:11:51.040
to help figure out what can make something better.

00:11:51.300 --> 00:11:52.360
There's nothing wrong with that

00:11:52.360 --> 00:11:53.700
as long as you always remember

00:11:53.700 --> 00:11:54.920
it's just speculation.

00:11:55.360 --> 00:11:57.200
So keep experimenting, keep discovering

00:11:57.200 --> 00:11:58.560
and keep an open mind

00:11:58.560 --> 00:12:02.920
for where the next "Citizen Kane" or "The Room" could possibly come from.

00:12:06.360 --> 00:12:07.360
I'm The Nostalgia Critic

00:12:07.360 --> 00:12:09.540
and don't worry, I won't be this fair the rest of the month.

00:12:09.840 --> 00:12:13.260
*Insidious laughter*

00:12:43.300 --> 00:12:43.800
Hey!

00:12:43.800 --> 00:12:45.080
Sorry for the handheld here.

00:12:45.080 --> 00:12:47.080
I uh, left my tripod at the office.

00:12:47.080 --> 00:12:49.140
But uh, that's not what you wanna hear about,

00:12:49.140 --> 00:12:51.920
you wanna hear what the charity shout-out is this week

00:12:51.920 --> 00:12:55.420
and you can thank Rob Paulson for his introduction to

00:12:55.420 --> 00:12:58.420
this charity, without him I wouldn't' have found out about this.

00:12:58.620 --> 00:13:00.140
This is Boot Campaign.

00:13:00.800 --> 00:13:04.640
Boot Campaign is trying to raise awareness for veterans.

00:13:05.200 --> 00:13:06.700
People that have gone to war.

00:13:06.700 --> 00:13:08.020
People that have served us.

00:13:08.020 --> 00:13:09.820
People that have put their lives in danger.

00:13:09.820 --> 00:13:11.220
People who have sacrificed so much.

00:13:11.220 --> 00:13:14.260
The campaign helps raise awareness of their sacrifice

00:13:14.260 --> 00:13:15.840
through the image of boots.

00:13:15.840 --> 00:13:18.160
Their big question is "Why do you wear your boots?".

00:13:18.400 --> 00:13:20.780
People go online and share their stories about why the

00:13:20.780 --> 00:13:23.500
soldiers who have served us mean so much to us.

00:13:23.820 --> 00:13:26.680
And as you imagine it isn't just buying boots and showing support,

00:13:26.680 --> 00:13:28.560
it's going online and donating.

00:13:28.560 --> 00:13:32.060
And one of the great things is that they show where the money is going.

00:13:32.220 --> 00:13:35.040
This is an organization that has gotten all sorts of celebrities on board

00:13:35.040 --> 00:13:36.480
Like I said, Rob Paulson

00:13:36.480 --> 00:13:38.740
but also the "Sons of Anarachy" cast.

00:13:38.940 --> 00:13:42.780
This is a great idea to raise awareness for people who definitely deserve it.

00:13:42.780 --> 00:13:46.320
The bravery and the dedication that these soldiers put forward

00:13:46.320 --> 00:13:47.520
is mind-blowing

00:13:47.520 --> 00:13:50.440
and you can show your support by either going to the web-site

00:13:50.440 --> 00:13:52.680
or even going to their YouTube page and seeing all the

00:13:52.680 --> 00:13:53.740
various stories.

00:13:54.140 --> 00:13:56.100
You can volunteer, you can donate

00:13:56.100 --> 00:13:57.860
or you can just wear your boots,

00:13:57.860 --> 00:14:00.120
which are also available to purchase on the web-site

00:14:00.120 --> 00:14:02.260
and help raise awareness and show support.

00:14:02.260 --> 00:14:05.440
Get online and tell everybody why you wear your boots.
