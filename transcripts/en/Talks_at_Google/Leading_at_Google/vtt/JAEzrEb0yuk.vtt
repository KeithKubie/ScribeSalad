00:00:05.980 --> 00:00:08.109
SPEAKER: So this
event is sort of

00:00:08.109 --> 00:00:11.200
to highlight some of the work
being done around LGBT youth

00:00:11.200 --> 00:00:13.432
work by an organization
called Lambda Legal.

00:00:13.432 --> 00:00:15.640
Many of you guys may be
familiar with Lambda already.

00:00:15.640 --> 00:00:18.850
They've been around since
1973 with the primary goal

00:00:18.850 --> 00:00:21.580
of fighting for full
equality for LGBT people

00:00:21.580 --> 00:00:24.820
and those living with HIV,
through primarily impact

00:00:24.820 --> 00:00:28.300
litigation and then also
education and policy work.

00:00:28.300 --> 00:00:29.745
So they're based in New York.

00:00:29.745 --> 00:00:31.870
They have presence in a
few other cities in the US.

00:00:31.870 --> 00:00:34.078
And they're in the process
of opening an office in DC

00:00:34.078 --> 00:00:34.914
right now.

00:00:34.914 --> 00:00:36.580
Given the kind of new
political climate,

00:00:36.580 --> 00:00:39.420
there's a lot of work to be
done there, as you guys know.

00:00:39.420 --> 00:00:42.155
So that process is ongoing.

00:00:42.155 --> 00:00:43.780
And one note that
was pointed out to me

00:00:43.780 --> 00:00:46.810
is that Lambda has won a
lot of their big victories

00:00:46.810 --> 00:00:48.760
during hostile administrations.

00:00:48.760 --> 00:00:49.570
It can be done.

00:00:49.570 --> 00:00:52.480
And will continue to
be done, as judiciary

00:00:52.480 --> 00:00:56.620
is a really important path
for us to make progress.

00:00:56.620 --> 00:00:59.346
So since we're talking
about LGBT youth today,

00:00:59.346 --> 00:01:01.720
I'd like to introduce you to
Currey Cook, who is actually

00:01:01.720 --> 00:01:04.209
the Director of the Youth
in Out-of-Home Care Project.

00:01:04.209 --> 00:01:06.340
He's also a staff
council at Lambda,

00:01:06.340 --> 00:01:08.740
which means he's a lawyer.

00:01:08.740 --> 00:01:11.680
And he has a lot of experience
working with LGBT youth.

00:01:11.680 --> 00:01:13.180
So before this,
he was co-director

00:01:13.180 --> 00:01:14.888
of the Bronx office
of the Children's Law

00:01:14.888 --> 00:01:16.167
Center in New York.

00:01:16.167 --> 00:01:18.750
He's also been a consultant to
the National Juvenile Defenders

00:01:18.750 --> 00:01:20.410
Center in Washington.

00:01:20.410 --> 00:01:22.090
He worked in Burundi
on an initiative

00:01:22.090 --> 00:01:25.030
to assist with reintegration
of former child soldiers

00:01:25.030 --> 00:01:26.860
into society.

00:01:26.860 --> 00:01:28.850
And before that, he spent
12 years in New York

00:01:28.850 --> 00:01:31.000
as an attorney for children
in foster care and juvenile

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:31.360
justice.

00:01:31.360 --> 00:01:33.220
So he has a lot of
experience in this field.

00:01:33.220 --> 00:01:35.710
There's no one better to
speak to us about this.

00:01:35.710 --> 00:01:37.332
Mr. Currey Cook.

00:01:37.332 --> 00:01:40.098
[APPLAUSE]

00:01:40.098 --> 00:01:41.670
CURREY COOK: Hi everyone.

00:01:41.670 --> 00:01:43.890
So I'm going to talk to
you just for a little bit

00:01:43.890 --> 00:01:47.370
to give you kind of an
overview of the landscape,

00:01:47.370 --> 00:01:50.010
particularly around young
people who are in what we

00:01:50.010 --> 00:01:52.317
call youth in out-of-home care.

00:01:52.317 --> 00:01:54.150
So what we mean by that
term is young people

00:01:54.150 --> 00:01:55.924
that are in the
foster care system,

00:01:55.924 --> 00:01:57.840
in the juvenile justice
system, and youth that

00:01:57.840 --> 00:01:59.680
are experiencing homelessness.

00:01:59.680 --> 00:02:04.110
And also a little bit about
LGBTQ+ young people that are

00:02:04.110 --> 00:02:07.410
undocumented, particularly
in our current climate.

00:02:07.410 --> 00:02:09.419
Obviously that's a big
concern with what's

00:02:09.419 --> 00:02:12.790
going on around immigration
and refugees in our country.

00:02:12.790 --> 00:02:14.490
So I'm going to talk
for a little bit.

00:02:14.490 --> 00:02:15.906
But then I'm going
to turn it over

00:02:15.906 --> 00:02:18.120
to the really important
people for you to hear from,

00:02:18.120 --> 00:02:21.570
which are three of my awesome
clients who are joining us.

00:02:21.570 --> 00:02:25.436
And one of them is Soul, who's
here, who now lives in Fremont.

00:02:25.436 --> 00:02:27.060
But I met him when
he was in the Bronx.

00:02:27.060 --> 00:02:33.000
And then Savannah, who is
in Pittsburgh, living there

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:35.160
in foster care right now.

00:02:35.160 --> 00:02:38.930
And then Lydia,
who lives in Texas,

00:02:38.930 --> 00:02:42.120
and was in long-term
juvenile justice facilities

00:02:42.120 --> 00:02:44.850
for two years and experienced
a lot of discrimination

00:02:44.850 --> 00:02:46.620
and mistreatment
while locked up there.

00:02:46.620 --> 00:02:49.230
So I think it will be really
great for me to hear directly

00:02:49.230 --> 00:02:51.780
from them about
their experiences

00:02:51.780 --> 00:02:53.610
as gay and trans
young people who

00:02:53.610 --> 00:02:55.590
are involved in these systems.

00:02:55.590 --> 00:02:58.989
I'm also going to talk just
a little bit about school.

00:02:58.989 --> 00:03:01.530
Obviously there's been a lot in
the news about trans students

00:03:01.530 --> 00:03:05.010
in school and a Trump
administration reversal

00:03:05.010 --> 00:03:07.950
of guidance to protect
trans students in school,

00:03:07.950 --> 00:03:10.290
and a recent decision
by the Supreme Court

00:03:10.290 --> 00:03:12.010
to kick a case back down.

00:03:12.010 --> 00:03:13.740
G.G., which you may
have heard about.

00:03:13.740 --> 00:03:15.009
Gavin Grimm's case.

00:03:15.009 --> 00:03:16.800
So I'll also talk about
that, and just some

00:03:16.800 --> 00:03:20.070
of the broader work that's going
on, because it's all related,

00:03:20.070 --> 00:03:20.801
of course, right?

00:03:20.801 --> 00:03:22.800
So first I'll just kind
of give you a little bit

00:03:22.800 --> 00:03:25.170
of an overview of all this.

00:03:25.170 --> 00:03:27.840
And then we'll get into
the good conversation.

00:03:27.840 --> 00:03:30.120
So, obviously, when we're
talking about identity

00:03:30.120 --> 00:03:33.820
for folks, it encompasses all
kinds of things for all of us,

00:03:33.820 --> 00:03:34.320
right?

00:03:34.320 --> 00:03:37.410
And our gender identity,
the sex that we

00:03:37.410 --> 00:03:40.470
are assigned at birth, our
sexual orientation, all

00:03:40.470 --> 00:03:43.890
of those are components
of who we are as a whole.

00:03:43.890 --> 00:03:45.450
Goes without saying, kind of.

00:03:45.450 --> 00:03:47.880
But I mention it here
because particularly

00:03:47.880 --> 00:03:50.310
in the systems that
we're talking about,

00:03:50.310 --> 00:03:53.580
overwhelmingly it's
young people of color

00:03:53.580 --> 00:03:56.190
that are represented in these
out-of-home care systems,

00:03:56.190 --> 00:03:58.110
like foster care and
juvenile justice,

00:03:58.110 --> 00:04:01.740
because of social
justice issues,

00:04:01.740 --> 00:04:04.410
institutional racism,
all kinds of things

00:04:04.410 --> 00:04:07.590
that drive young people of color
into those systems at higher

00:04:07.590 --> 00:04:09.510
rates, right?

00:04:09.510 --> 00:04:11.700
So when we're talking
about the young people

00:04:11.700 --> 00:04:14.520
that I'm going to be going over
and talking about their rights

00:04:14.520 --> 00:04:17.940
today, really we're
talking about queer trans

00:04:17.940 --> 00:04:18.850
youth of color.

00:04:18.850 --> 00:04:20.308
That's who we're
talking about, OK?

00:04:20.308 --> 00:04:23.070
So that's why I wanted to put
this on, a slide up, so you

00:04:23.070 --> 00:04:25.457
can think about kind
of people holistically,

00:04:25.457 --> 00:04:27.540
even though we're going
to be specifically talking

00:04:27.540 --> 00:04:30.640
about sexual orientation and
gender identity, sex, and all

00:04:30.640 --> 00:04:32.230
that today.

00:04:32.230 --> 00:04:38.010
So there's not nearly enough
data about how LGBTQ+ young

00:04:38.010 --> 00:04:41.490
people are doing in these
systems because it's really

00:04:41.490 --> 00:04:42.975
difficult, for
important reasons,

00:04:42.975 --> 00:04:45.300
not to be doing research on
children and particularly

00:04:45.300 --> 00:04:46.800
children that are
in custody, right?

00:04:46.800 --> 00:04:49.500
But we do know some things, OK?

00:04:49.500 --> 00:04:52.680
So part of this data I've
kind of summarized here

00:04:52.680 --> 00:04:55.860
in this chart, which is
kind of this vicious cycle

00:04:55.860 --> 00:04:57.790
that a lot of
LGBTQ young people,

00:04:57.790 --> 00:05:00.990
particularly young people of
color, get into, all right?

00:05:00.990 --> 00:05:03.897
And that is if you've
been rejected from home

00:05:03.897 --> 00:05:06.480
because of who you are-- so your
parents have literally kicked

00:05:06.480 --> 00:05:10.170
you out, which happens to way
too many LGBTQ+ young people,

00:05:10.170 --> 00:05:10.800
right--

00:05:10.800 --> 00:05:13.980
then you can go directly to
experiencing homelessness.

00:05:13.980 --> 00:05:17.040
Or you might be picked up by
the foster care system, placed

00:05:17.040 --> 00:05:18.900
into foster care.

00:05:18.900 --> 00:05:20.850
If you're not treated
well in foster care

00:05:20.850 --> 00:05:22.800
and are running away
from a foster home that

00:05:22.800 --> 00:05:24.420
isn't supportive
of you, then you

00:05:24.420 --> 00:05:26.460
could go from there
to homelessness.

00:05:26.460 --> 00:05:29.160
Or if you have a conflict
with your foster parent

00:05:29.160 --> 00:05:31.170
because they don't
like who you are

00:05:31.170 --> 00:05:34.500
or the way you present, and
you get into a fight in school

00:05:34.500 --> 00:05:37.430
or at home, and then
get an assault charge,

00:05:37.430 --> 00:05:40.320
then you can go over to the
juvenile justice system.

00:05:40.320 --> 00:05:43.350
Or if you're in a school
and you're being bullied--

00:05:43.350 --> 00:05:45.990
and Lydia will talk a
little bit about this,

00:05:45.990 --> 00:05:48.960
right-- then you can
go straight from school

00:05:48.960 --> 00:05:50.830
into the juvenile
justice system.

00:05:50.830 --> 00:05:52.590
How many of you have
seen "Moonlight?"

00:05:52.590 --> 00:05:53.120
All righty.

00:05:53.120 --> 00:05:53.620
Right?

00:05:53.620 --> 00:05:55.980
There's a really, like, just--

00:05:55.980 --> 00:05:58.590
scene there that really
hits home, right,

00:05:58.590 --> 00:06:01.080
of Chiron being
picked on in school,

00:06:01.080 --> 00:06:02.932
and then he gets
arrested and hauled off

00:06:02.932 --> 00:06:04.890
because he's fighting
back for being picked on.

00:06:04.890 --> 00:06:07.030
So that's kind of what
we're talking about here.

00:06:07.030 --> 00:06:08.880
And I have additional
factors on there

00:06:08.880 --> 00:06:11.940
to think about other aspects
of identity and who you are,

00:06:11.940 --> 00:06:14.850
particularly thinking about
if you're undocumented.

00:06:14.850 --> 00:06:17.100
And all of this is kind
of happening, right?

00:06:17.100 --> 00:06:20.910
Like the additional layers of
challenges that you may face.

00:06:20.910 --> 00:06:22.830
And, unfortunately,
this cycle happens

00:06:22.830 --> 00:06:24.960
for a lot of young people.

00:06:24.960 --> 00:06:28.110
But for LGBTQ+ youth, and
particularly those of color,

00:06:28.110 --> 00:06:29.325
this is, like, on steroids.

00:06:29.325 --> 00:06:31.200
So you're going from
one system to the other,

00:06:31.200 --> 00:06:33.540
you are multi systemic
involved, and also

00:06:33.540 --> 00:06:37.650
if you're in foster care and
you haven't been affirmed there,

00:06:37.650 --> 00:06:40.820
then that can lead to sort
of all of these other things,

00:06:40.820 --> 00:06:43.820
and then sort of
back in again, right?

00:06:43.820 --> 00:06:47.540
So just important to think about
the different layers of system

00:06:47.540 --> 00:06:51.110
involvement, kind of the reasons
why and that this cycle happens

00:06:51.110 --> 00:06:54.500
at elevated rates for
LGBTQ+ young people.

00:06:54.500 --> 00:06:55.130
OK.

00:06:55.130 --> 00:06:58.310
So people always want to
know what the numbers are.

00:06:58.310 --> 00:07:00.050
Like, what are we talking about?

00:07:00.050 --> 00:07:01.610
That, again, as I
said earlier, is

00:07:01.610 --> 00:07:04.580
challenging because we don't
necessarily have enough data.

00:07:04.580 --> 00:07:08.960
But what we do have is a study
out of Los Angeles County that

00:07:08.960 --> 00:07:13.400
basically found that out of
this 700+ young people they

00:07:13.400 --> 00:07:18.950
surveyed, 19.1%
identified as LGBTQ.

00:07:18.950 --> 00:07:23.660
So that's over double, probably,
than our estimates of LGBTQ+

00:07:23.660 --> 00:07:25.980
people in the
general population.

00:07:25.980 --> 00:07:31.310
And then if you look at this one
circle with transgender youth,

00:07:31.310 --> 00:07:35.120
the survey came out with 5.6%
of the young people surveyed

00:07:35.120 --> 00:07:38.510
identifying as trans, which,
if our estimates are maybe

00:07:38.510 --> 00:07:43.400
1% to 2% of people in
general identifying as trans,

00:07:43.400 --> 00:07:45.860
that's enormous
over-representation.

00:07:45.860 --> 00:07:48.710
So kind of going back
to our, like, why

00:07:48.710 --> 00:07:50.630
are those numbers so high?

00:07:50.630 --> 00:07:53.192
So much of it is fueled
by family rejection.

00:07:53.192 --> 00:07:55.650
So, kids getting kicked out
and ending up in these systems,

00:07:55.650 --> 00:07:58.100
even though they may end up
for other reasons, that's

00:07:58.100 --> 00:07:59.570
largely what's fueling it.

00:07:59.570 --> 00:08:02.030
In the juvenile justice system,
the numbers are the same.

00:08:02.030 --> 00:08:03.260
20%.

00:08:03.260 --> 00:08:04.970
I mean, one study in
Northern California

00:08:04.970 --> 00:08:08.390
recently, about 30% of girls
who are in the juvenile justice

00:08:08.390 --> 00:08:10.850
system in California
identified somewhere

00:08:10.850 --> 00:08:12.690
along the LGBTQ spectrum.

00:08:12.690 --> 00:08:15.620
So we're talking about a way
over-representation, which

00:08:15.620 --> 00:08:18.980
is why Lambda has this youth in
out-of-home care project that I

00:08:18.980 --> 00:08:21.194
focus on, which is
because there's so

00:08:21.194 --> 00:08:22.610
many young people
in these systems

00:08:22.610 --> 00:08:25.190
and we know that they have
really bad experiences there,

00:08:25.190 --> 00:08:26.720
many of them, OK?

00:08:26.720 --> 00:08:30.440
So this also leads to this
criminalization factor

00:08:30.440 --> 00:08:33.049
I was talking about when
I alluded to "Moonlight."

00:08:33.049 --> 00:08:34.880
But there are all kinds
of other pipelines.

00:08:34.880 --> 00:08:37.460
How many of you heard of the
school-to-prison pipeline?

00:08:37.460 --> 00:08:38.929
Heard that term before?

00:08:38.929 --> 00:08:42.200
That's one that justifiably
gets a lot of attention

00:08:42.200 --> 00:08:43.309
and conversation.

00:08:43.309 --> 00:08:44.700
But there are other pipelines.

00:08:44.700 --> 00:08:46.910
So I mentioned the foster
care prison pipeline.

00:08:46.910 --> 00:08:49.277
So conflict in a group
home, if you're placed there

00:08:49.277 --> 00:08:51.110
with other peers who
aren't accepting of you

00:08:51.110 --> 00:08:53.060
or staff who aren't
accepting of you,

00:08:53.060 --> 00:08:55.600
can lead to an assault
charge that gets you in jail.

00:08:55.600 --> 00:08:57.300
Youth who are
experiencing homelessness

00:08:57.300 --> 00:09:01.310
who may be engaging in what some
people call survival crimes.

00:09:01.310 --> 00:09:04.220
So, for example, you
are engaging in sex work

00:09:04.220 --> 00:09:06.830
because you have to pay
for a place to sleep.

00:09:06.830 --> 00:09:10.250
Or you're experiencing
homelessness, don't have a job,

00:09:10.250 --> 00:09:12.309
and you need to access
public transportation.

00:09:12.309 --> 00:09:13.100
I live in New York.

00:09:13.100 --> 00:09:15.159
So you jump the
subway turnstile,

00:09:15.159 --> 00:09:17.450
and then you get picked up,
and then you get a warrant,

00:09:17.450 --> 00:09:20.075
and then you don't have money to
pay the warrant, and that sort

00:09:20.075 --> 00:09:21.470
of cycle starts, right?

00:09:21.470 --> 00:09:25.160
And then the bottom one
we have is walking while.

00:09:25.160 --> 00:09:27.560
So you may have heard people
talk about being picked up

00:09:27.560 --> 00:09:30.050
and walking while black or
driving while black, right?

00:09:30.050 --> 00:09:32.690
So for, say, trans
women of color

00:09:32.690 --> 00:09:36.140
are often profiled as engaging
in sex work or prostitution

00:09:36.140 --> 00:09:38.510
or just picked up walking
down the street, right?

00:09:38.510 --> 00:09:40.940
Because of profiling by police.

00:09:40.940 --> 00:09:46.430
So, for example, if you are an
African-American transgender

00:09:46.430 --> 00:09:49.790
woman of color in the
foster care system living

00:09:49.790 --> 00:09:53.120
in Baton Rouge, Louisiana, for
example, one of my clients,

00:09:53.120 --> 00:09:55.250
you could have all of
these things happening

00:09:55.250 --> 00:09:59.300
to you simultaneously or in
different aspects of your life.

00:09:59.300 --> 00:10:01.070
So just thinking
about all the factors

00:10:01.070 --> 00:10:03.920
that kind of drive young people
into these systems at higher

00:10:03.920 --> 00:10:05.000
numbers.

00:10:05.000 --> 00:10:06.650
The foster care
system is one that's

00:10:06.650 --> 00:10:08.660
kind of surprising
for folks that ends up

00:10:08.660 --> 00:10:11.390
having youth experiencing
homelessness because you think,

00:10:11.390 --> 00:10:13.550
well, isn't that the point
of being in foster care

00:10:13.550 --> 00:10:15.350
is that you have
a place to live?

00:10:15.350 --> 00:10:18.000
And you have someone who will
adopt you or care for you?

00:10:18.000 --> 00:10:20.780
But, unfortunately, in
the foster care system,

00:10:20.780 --> 00:10:23.990
if you don't have people
working to help you get back

00:10:23.990 --> 00:10:27.350
with your family, to help them
understand you and accept you,

00:10:27.350 --> 00:10:28.940
then you can end up
in a foster home.

00:10:28.940 --> 00:10:31.460
If the foster home doesn't
accept you for who you are--

00:10:31.460 --> 00:10:32.990
and we'll hear
from Savannah talk

00:10:32.990 --> 00:10:34.910
a little bit about
that in a minute--

00:10:34.910 --> 00:10:37.310
then you can end up in a
shelter or a group home.

00:10:37.310 --> 00:10:39.260
If that's not
supportive, then you

00:10:39.260 --> 00:10:42.080
can take off, because you
don't feel safe there.

00:10:42.080 --> 00:10:45.050
And then you can end up homeless
and with no adult connected

00:10:45.050 --> 00:10:47.820
to you outside the system.

00:10:47.820 --> 00:10:51.530
So all of this stuff leads to
this really shocking figure,

00:10:51.530 --> 00:10:54.000
which is 40%.

00:10:54.000 --> 00:10:56.450
And that is estimates
of youth who

00:10:56.450 --> 00:10:58.100
are experiencing
homelessness that

00:10:58.100 --> 00:11:02.660
identify in the LGBTQ spectrum,
which again, if we think

00:11:02.660 --> 00:11:05.570
about maybe 7% to
10% being the numbers

00:11:05.570 --> 00:11:07.490
in the general
population, that's

00:11:07.490 --> 00:11:11.600
just crazy over-representation
for all of these factors

00:11:11.600 --> 00:11:13.304
I talked about.

00:11:13.304 --> 00:11:15.470
And then for young people
that are in these systems,

00:11:15.470 --> 00:11:18.680
once they're in, all
kinds of problems

00:11:18.680 --> 00:11:20.270
can happen and do happen.

00:11:20.270 --> 00:11:24.710
So one is just not feeling
safe to say who you are.

00:11:24.710 --> 00:11:27.290
So not being able
to come out or talk

00:11:27.290 --> 00:11:30.350
about your sexual orientation
or identity or express yourself

00:11:30.350 --> 00:11:32.450
freely leads to
isolation, which causes

00:11:32.450 --> 00:11:34.670
a lot of bad
outcomes, depression,

00:11:34.670 --> 00:11:37.130
suicidal ideation,
those sorts of things.

00:11:37.130 --> 00:11:38.480
Being victimized.

00:11:38.480 --> 00:11:41.475
So Lydia is going to talk a
little bit about her experience

00:11:41.475 --> 00:11:43.960
in the juvenile justice
facility and being

00:11:43.960 --> 00:11:46.960
a victim of assault in
there because of who she is.

00:11:46.960 --> 00:11:48.040
Differential treatment.

00:11:48.040 --> 00:11:51.520
So, say, straight kids
are allowed to date

00:11:51.520 --> 00:11:56.290
and have friends over, have sort
of normal relationships, right,

00:11:56.290 --> 00:11:59.710
but a foster parent may
not allow a young person

00:11:59.710 --> 00:12:02.097
to have a same-sex friend over
that they're attracted to,

00:12:02.097 --> 00:12:02.930
or things like that.

00:12:02.930 --> 00:12:05.100
So different rules applying.

00:12:05.100 --> 00:12:06.670
And then these
disclosure dilemmas

00:12:06.670 --> 00:12:08.320
are confidentiality violations.

00:12:08.320 --> 00:12:11.290
So if you do say
who you are, lots

00:12:11.290 --> 00:12:13.870
of things you have
to navigate around,

00:12:13.870 --> 00:12:16.300
whether it's safe to do that,
how that's going to play,

00:12:16.300 --> 00:12:19.270
are you going to be
rejected once you come out.

00:12:19.270 --> 00:12:20.480
Confidentiality.

00:12:20.480 --> 00:12:24.130
So if you do say who
you are, do people

00:12:24.130 --> 00:12:25.710
gossip about that
to somebody else?

00:12:25.710 --> 00:12:28.590
Are you outed to other
people without you knowing?

00:12:28.590 --> 00:12:30.340
And then I mentioned
earlier, kind of lack

00:12:30.340 --> 00:12:32.000
of family-centered services.

00:12:32.000 --> 00:12:34.300
So the foster care
system is supposed

00:12:34.300 --> 00:12:37.960
to help you get safely back
to your parents if you can.

00:12:37.960 --> 00:12:40.210
But if no one's actually
working with your parents

00:12:40.210 --> 00:12:42.830
on accepting you
for who you are,

00:12:42.830 --> 00:12:45.940
then you're already cycling
further into the system,

00:12:45.940 --> 00:12:46.906
like we talked about.

00:12:46.906 --> 00:12:48.280
And then, finally,
and a big one,

00:12:48.280 --> 00:12:52.240
is the lack of cultural
competency in serving

00:12:52.240 --> 00:12:54.430
LGBT youth in these systems.

00:12:54.430 --> 00:12:57.730
So a big example is if you're
a transgender young person

00:12:57.730 --> 00:13:00.760
and you're referred to a
doctor or medical provider who

00:13:00.760 --> 00:13:03.670
knows nothing about working
with trans young people,

00:13:03.670 --> 00:13:05.860
then you're not going to
get accurate information

00:13:05.860 --> 00:13:08.770
about whether you may be able
to begin hormone therapy,

00:13:08.770 --> 00:13:11.890
if you're a younger
person, if you're eligible

00:13:11.890 --> 00:13:14.800
or a good candidate for
puberty blockers, right?

00:13:14.800 --> 00:13:16.600
You're not getting
accurate information.

00:13:16.600 --> 00:13:19.900
For some of my gay
clients in foster care,

00:13:19.900 --> 00:13:22.360
no one has ever mentioned
to them about PrEP,

00:13:22.360 --> 00:13:23.920
or the possibility
of being on PrEP,

00:13:23.920 --> 00:13:27.760
so you're really kind of having
to navigate all of these things

00:13:27.760 --> 00:13:29.350
within the context
of health care.

00:13:29.350 --> 00:13:30.766
And so you're not
actually getting

00:13:30.766 --> 00:13:33.746
your needs met, or accurate
information when you're there.

00:13:33.746 --> 00:13:35.620
So, real quickly, I'll
talk just a little bit

00:13:35.620 --> 00:13:37.487
about the more boring parts.

00:13:37.487 --> 00:13:39.820
Since I'm a lawyer, I feel
obligated to talk about this,

00:13:39.820 --> 00:13:41.980
which is the law
and policies that

00:13:41.980 --> 00:13:44.170
protects young people
in these systems, right?

00:13:44.170 --> 00:13:47.570
So you have constitutional
rights if you're in care.

00:13:47.570 --> 00:13:49.340
You have the right
to be treated fairly.

00:13:49.340 --> 00:13:50.860
So, to equal protection.

00:13:50.860 --> 00:13:53.770
You also have the right to due
process, which means safety.

00:13:53.770 --> 00:13:55.550
Your physical and
emotional safety.

00:13:55.550 --> 00:13:58.180
So if the state has taken
you away from your parents

00:13:58.180 --> 00:14:00.190
and placed you out
of home, then they

00:14:00.190 --> 00:14:03.340
have an obligation to
ensure that you're safe.

00:14:03.340 --> 00:14:06.400
So every kid in care
has these rights.

00:14:06.400 --> 00:14:08.860
Additionally, there
are federal statutes

00:14:08.860 --> 00:14:11.030
that provide protection
for discrimination.

00:14:11.030 --> 00:14:13.690
So on the juvenile justice
side, the Juvenile Justice

00:14:13.690 --> 00:14:16.150
and Delinquency Prevention
Act prohibits discrimination

00:14:16.150 --> 00:14:17.680
based on sex.

00:14:17.680 --> 00:14:20.950
So we'll talk a little bit
about sex-based discrimination.

00:14:20.950 --> 00:14:22.690
But more and more
courts are saying,

00:14:22.690 --> 00:14:28.100
no, sex as a protected class
includes sex stereotyping.

00:14:28.100 --> 00:14:31.050
So assuming that men
should be dating women

00:14:31.050 --> 00:14:32.440
and marrying women, right?

00:14:32.440 --> 00:14:35.219
Or that you should be conforming
to some sort of expectations

00:14:35.219 --> 00:14:37.510
for the sex that you were
assigned at birth and the way

00:14:37.510 --> 00:14:38.830
you present yourself.

00:14:38.830 --> 00:14:40.990
And also gender identity, right?

00:14:40.990 --> 00:14:44.194
Clearly, obviously
connected with sex, right?

00:14:44.194 --> 00:14:45.610
So there may be
protections there.

00:14:45.610 --> 00:14:46.750
Regulations.

00:14:46.750 --> 00:14:48.460
At the end of the
Obama administration,

00:14:48.460 --> 00:14:50.920
a couple of major
regulations came out

00:14:50.920 --> 00:14:52.820
that provide
explicit protection.

00:14:52.820 --> 00:14:55.120
So they say you may
not discriminate

00:14:55.120 --> 00:14:57.070
based on sexual orientation,
gender identity,

00:14:57.070 --> 00:14:59.590
and gender expression
for youth that

00:14:59.590 --> 00:15:01.990
are being served by
homeless shelters that

00:15:01.990 --> 00:15:04.330
receive federal funding.

00:15:04.330 --> 00:15:06.749
So that is fantastic, right?

00:15:06.749 --> 00:15:08.290
But those are some
of the things that

00:15:08.290 --> 00:15:10.330
are at risk with this
current administration

00:15:10.330 --> 00:15:11.380
and current Congress.

00:15:11.380 --> 00:15:15.850
So those are regulations that
they may pull back completely,

00:15:15.850 --> 00:15:17.890
cut out through the
Congressional Review Act,

00:15:17.890 --> 00:15:20.380
or try to go through
the regulatory process

00:15:20.380 --> 00:15:22.470
to get rid of those.

00:15:22.470 --> 00:15:23.980
On the foster care
side, a big one

00:15:23.980 --> 00:15:26.290
came out that said if you
receive federal funding

00:15:26.290 --> 00:15:28.020
from Health and
Human Services, then

00:15:28.020 --> 00:15:30.790
you can't discriminate based on
sexual orientation and gender

00:15:30.790 --> 00:15:31.330
identities.

00:15:31.330 --> 00:15:33.532
That includes child
welfare agencies, right?

00:15:33.532 --> 00:15:34.990
And under the Obama
administration,

00:15:34.990 --> 00:15:37.281
a lot of the federal agencies
that look at these things

00:15:37.281 --> 00:15:39.760
did a lot of great
work around LGBTQ.

00:15:39.760 --> 00:15:43.080
So all that stuff is
absolutely at risk

00:15:43.080 --> 00:15:45.130
now and what we have
to be vigilant about.

00:15:45.130 --> 00:15:49.120
So from state to state, each
state systems in these areas

00:15:49.120 --> 00:15:50.740
may have explicit protections.

00:15:50.740 --> 00:15:54.100
So probably to the
surprise of no one,

00:15:54.100 --> 00:15:57.040
the top two states in
terms of adding protection

00:15:57.040 --> 00:16:00.910
for kids in these areas are
New York and California.

00:16:00.910 --> 00:16:03.976
The bottom two, which have no
explicit protection, including

00:16:03.976 --> 00:16:06.100
sexual orientation, gender
identity, or expression,

00:16:06.100 --> 00:16:09.250
or even sex in their laws
applicable to these systems

00:16:09.250 --> 00:16:12.960
are Alaska and North
Carolina, which as we know,

00:16:12.960 --> 00:16:16.870
North Carolina is already not
doing good things with HB2

00:16:16.870 --> 00:16:18.640
in their bill, which
we are litigating

00:16:18.640 --> 00:16:21.160
with the ACLU against them.

00:16:21.160 --> 00:16:24.010
Also some public accommodation
laws and human rights laws

00:16:24.010 --> 00:16:26.350
may protect kids.

00:16:26.350 --> 00:16:27.520
So I want to--

00:16:27.520 --> 00:16:30.430
I'll show you a quick map
of this and then I'll close.

00:16:30.430 --> 00:16:32.530
But I do want to
emphasize particularly

00:16:32.530 --> 00:16:37.210
that transgender youth who
are involved in these systems

00:16:37.210 --> 00:16:40.950
really bear the brunt of
a ton of discrimination

00:16:40.950 --> 00:16:44.400
around who they are, from the
basics of not respecting name

00:16:44.400 --> 00:16:47.250
and pronouns to not
getting qualified care.

00:16:47.250 --> 00:16:50.370
Like I said, being
placed, if you are a girl,

00:16:50.370 --> 00:16:52.680
being placed in a
boy's group home

00:16:52.680 --> 00:16:54.720
because they interpret
the requirement

00:16:54.720 --> 00:16:58.050
to place youth of different
genders in different facilities

00:16:58.050 --> 00:17:02.010
as gender assigned at birth
rather than who you really are.

00:17:02.010 --> 00:17:05.670
So because all of these
systems are so sex-segregated,

00:17:05.670 --> 00:17:09.000
trans youth, or youth who
don't conform with expectations

00:17:09.000 --> 00:17:10.470
of their gender
assigned at birth,

00:17:10.470 --> 00:17:12.480
really just get
all kinds of stuff.

00:17:12.480 --> 00:17:15.780
And Savannah is going to talk
a little bit about that and how

00:17:15.780 --> 00:17:18.780
she's in an affirming
program now.

00:17:18.780 --> 00:17:21.660
So, real quick, I
will just show you,

00:17:21.660 --> 00:17:23.440
to kind of give you an idea.

00:17:23.440 --> 00:17:25.740
So this is kind of a map--

00:17:25.740 --> 00:17:28.359
is a map, actually--
of the United States

00:17:28.359 --> 00:17:31.650
and showing what states
have no protection.

00:17:31.650 --> 00:17:33.710
So you can see the red states--

00:17:33.710 --> 00:17:35.880
so this is in the
child welfare system--

00:17:35.880 --> 00:17:37.860
have no explicit
protections that

00:17:37.860 --> 00:17:41.110
include sexual orientation,
gender identity, or expression.

00:17:41.110 --> 00:17:42.189
Why is that important?

00:17:42.189 --> 00:17:43.980
Because if you're
working in these systems,

00:17:43.980 --> 00:17:45.479
if you're a
professional, say you're

00:17:45.479 --> 00:17:48.660
a staff at a group home
for kids in foster care,

00:17:48.660 --> 00:17:51.600
and your training
says you may not

00:17:51.600 --> 00:17:53.340
discriminate
against young people

00:17:53.340 --> 00:17:57.540
because our law or policy
says you can't, then you

00:17:57.540 --> 00:17:59.290
can get the message.

00:17:59.290 --> 00:18:01.160
And it's clear.

00:18:01.160 --> 00:18:04.070
If not, and somebody
says, you shouldn't

00:18:04.070 --> 00:18:06.922
be doing that, then you
could say, well, why?

00:18:06.922 --> 00:18:07.880
Where does it say that?

00:18:07.880 --> 00:18:09.020
Right?

00:18:09.020 --> 00:18:09.747
Nobody told me.

00:18:09.747 --> 00:18:11.330
Like, the law doesn't
say that, right?

00:18:11.330 --> 00:18:14.810
So it just allows for people's
essential personal biases--

00:18:14.810 --> 00:18:16.590
beliefs-- to creep in.

00:18:16.590 --> 00:18:18.950
So I do a lot of work
around the country

00:18:18.950 --> 00:18:20.872
of trying to make
sure that states

00:18:20.872 --> 00:18:22.580
do have explicit
protection and that they

00:18:22.580 --> 00:18:26.234
do training to make
sure that people working

00:18:26.234 --> 00:18:27.650
with young people
in these systems

00:18:27.650 --> 00:18:31.400
understand that they
must treat young people--

00:18:31.400 --> 00:18:33.590
must affirm their identity,
must treat them well,

00:18:33.590 --> 00:18:35.870
must make sure that they don't--

00:18:35.870 --> 00:18:37.910
they must not treat
them differently,

00:18:37.910 --> 00:18:41.702
right, than non-LGBTQ
kids in their care.

00:18:41.702 --> 00:18:43.160
So that's the child
welfare system.

00:18:43.160 --> 00:18:47.221
And then you can see the
juvenile justice system.

00:18:47.221 --> 00:18:47.720
Right.

00:18:47.720 --> 00:18:51.560
If I can scroll down
just a little bit here.

00:18:51.560 --> 00:18:52.672
Yeah.

00:18:52.672 --> 00:18:54.290
You get the idea.

00:18:54.290 --> 00:18:56.279
So we have a report
coming out soon

00:18:56.279 --> 00:18:58.820
with children's rights and the
Center for the Study of Social

00:18:58.820 --> 00:19:01.652
Policy that summarizes
all of this law, talks

00:19:01.652 --> 00:19:03.110
about the protections
in the state,

00:19:03.110 --> 00:19:06.860
and also and really
importantly features providers

00:19:06.860 --> 00:19:08.600
in the juvenile justice world--

00:19:08.600 --> 00:19:11.610
runaway and homeless youth
shelters, foster care--

00:19:11.610 --> 00:19:14.180
that actually are affirming
transgender youth.

00:19:14.180 --> 00:19:16.940
So one of my clients
is now and Kate--

00:19:16.940 --> 00:19:18.920
and Savannah, too,
that you'll hear from--

00:19:18.920 --> 00:19:20.580
are now on in
girls' programming.

00:19:20.580 --> 00:19:24.050
So as a transgender girl,
the state foster care agency

00:19:24.050 --> 00:19:27.260
has placed them in a girls'
group home, as they should,

00:19:27.260 --> 00:19:27.800
right?

00:19:27.800 --> 00:19:29.174
So we're highlighting
people that

00:19:29.174 --> 00:19:31.460
are doing the right thing
as we know a lot of schools

00:19:31.460 --> 00:19:34.520
are, too, in affirming
young people.

00:19:34.520 --> 00:19:37.460
And also having six
young people, who

00:19:37.460 --> 00:19:39.080
are trans or
gender-nonconforming,

00:19:39.080 --> 00:19:41.240
who are describing their
positive experiences,

00:19:41.240 --> 00:19:43.700
because we hear so many
horror stories because a lot

00:19:43.700 --> 00:19:45.026
of bad stuff is happening.

00:19:45.026 --> 00:19:46.400
But also really
important to know

00:19:46.400 --> 00:19:48.380
that there are a lot of
people doing the right thing.

00:19:48.380 --> 00:19:50.760
And a lot of young people
that are benefiting from that.

00:19:50.760 --> 00:19:54.380
And so I will use
that as my segue over

00:19:54.380 --> 00:19:56.640
into hearing from some of them.

00:19:56.640 --> 00:20:01.070
So, Soul, you want
to come up first?

00:20:01.070 --> 00:20:05.440
So this is Savannah,
who lives in Pittsburgh.

00:20:05.440 --> 00:20:08.988
And Lydia, you
want to say hello?

00:20:11.886 --> 00:20:13.270
LYDIA: Hello.

00:20:13.270 --> 00:20:17.870
CURREY COOK: And this is Lydia,
who lives in San Antonio.

00:20:17.870 --> 00:20:20.990
So I was talking a little
bit about focusing kind

00:20:20.990 --> 00:20:23.882
of on youth in foster
care, juvenile justice,

00:20:23.882 --> 00:20:25.340
runaway and homeless
youth systems.

00:20:25.340 --> 00:20:29.330
But Soul, we actually
met because Soul

00:20:29.330 --> 00:20:31.160
came to our attention
when we reached out

00:20:31.160 --> 00:20:33.270
to the LGBT center
in New York City

00:20:33.270 --> 00:20:35.660
and were asking them about
whether they were seeing

00:20:35.660 --> 00:20:38.930
undocumented LGBTQ
young people coming in

00:20:38.930 --> 00:20:40.850
and sort of what they
were doing about that.

00:20:40.850 --> 00:20:43.190
Like how were they
accessing legal help

00:20:43.190 --> 00:20:45.080
for those young people.

00:20:45.080 --> 00:20:48.410
So maybe we'll start with Soul,
if you don't mind telling folks

00:20:48.410 --> 00:20:50.690
a little bit about
where you're from

00:20:50.690 --> 00:20:53.320
and how you ended up in the US?

00:20:53.320 --> 00:20:55.580
SOUL: Yeah, sure.

00:20:55.580 --> 00:20:57.380
Basically, my name is Soul.

00:20:57.380 --> 00:21:02.160
And I'm from West Africa.

00:21:02.160 --> 00:21:07.640
I moved out here in 2014.

00:21:07.640 --> 00:21:10.520
So, basically, I'm a student.

00:21:10.520 --> 00:21:16.100
And I'm part of LGBT people
[INAUDIBLE] community.

00:21:16.100 --> 00:21:23.260
So when I was in Africa, as
you know, like, in Africa,

00:21:23.260 --> 00:21:25.100
LGBT people are--

00:21:25.100 --> 00:21:27.797
they don't have no
rights, you know?

00:21:27.797 --> 00:21:28.880
They don't have the right.

00:21:28.880 --> 00:21:33.720
And it's a little bit hard
for us, for LGBT community,

00:21:33.720 --> 00:21:44.010
to defend themself over there,
and at the same time to--

00:21:44.010 --> 00:21:45.190
there is no right, you know?

00:21:45.190 --> 00:21:51.630
And so, basically, I had
an issue with my family.

00:21:51.630 --> 00:22:01.855
And the only way I find
[INAUDIBLE] to move here

00:22:01.855 --> 00:22:02.730
to the United States.

00:22:02.730 --> 00:22:06.230
And, basically, I didn't
go like a [INAUDIBLE].

00:22:06.230 --> 00:22:08.250
Like I didn't tell
myself, I'm going

00:22:08.250 --> 00:22:12.090
to come here to the United
States because of the problem

00:22:12.090 --> 00:22:13.320
I have with my family.

00:22:13.320 --> 00:22:16.620
But I just told
myself, I'm just going

00:22:16.620 --> 00:22:23.280
to move out here to basically to
pursue my education and stuff.

00:22:23.280 --> 00:22:30.810
And I was lucky to have some
friends going to university

00:22:30.810 --> 00:22:36.260
when I sent my paper over
there, and they just accepted me

00:22:36.260 --> 00:22:38.640
as an international student.

00:22:38.640 --> 00:22:40.260
And then moved out there.

00:22:40.260 --> 00:22:41.760
So, basically,
when I come here--

00:22:41.760 --> 00:22:43.854
and I didn't tell
my family why I'm

00:22:43.854 --> 00:22:45.520
going to move here
in the United States.

00:22:45.520 --> 00:22:46.894
I didn't tell them
because I want

00:22:46.894 --> 00:22:49.005
to stay here because I'm
going to be safe here

00:22:49.005 --> 00:22:49.880
in the United States.

00:22:49.880 --> 00:22:53.490
But I just told them I'm
going to study there.

00:22:53.490 --> 00:23:02.640
And when I got here I stopped
my education at the same time

00:23:02.640 --> 00:23:06.180
I lost any contact
with my family.

00:23:06.180 --> 00:23:10.110
So, basically, that's
how I just stay here.

00:23:10.110 --> 00:23:17.010
And after that, things went
a little bit difficult for me

00:23:17.010 --> 00:23:19.020
when I was in San Francisco.

00:23:19.020 --> 00:23:23.150
And then I moved in New
York City two months after.

00:23:23.150 --> 00:23:29.280
Then one month after that, I
heard about LGBT community.

00:23:29.280 --> 00:23:32.200
Because in Africa, we
don't have LGBT community.

00:23:32.200 --> 00:23:36.720
The thing is, I didn't
really know why we have

00:23:36.720 --> 00:23:39.210
LGBT community here in Africa--

00:23:39.210 --> 00:23:40.090
here in America.

00:23:40.090 --> 00:23:40.620
You know?

00:23:40.620 --> 00:23:41.910
I never heard about it.

00:23:41.910 --> 00:23:43.560
CURREY COOK: You
mean the center?

00:23:43.560 --> 00:23:44.344
The LGBT Center.

00:23:44.344 --> 00:23:45.260
SOUL: The LBGT Center.

00:23:45.260 --> 00:23:46.020
Sorry.

00:23:46.020 --> 00:23:47.190
The LBGT Center.

00:23:47.190 --> 00:23:49.070
So, basically, I
went there to see.

00:23:49.070 --> 00:23:53.599
I'm just going to go
see if I kind of like--

00:23:53.599 --> 00:23:55.890
I'm just going to go there
and know about it, you know,

00:23:55.890 --> 00:23:57.780
because I never heard
that before, you know?

00:23:57.780 --> 00:24:02.180
And when I went there, I really
see amazing people over there.

00:24:02.180 --> 00:24:05.489
And the people,
they were very cool.

00:24:05.489 --> 00:24:06.780
You know, like, they helped me.

00:24:06.780 --> 00:24:12.490
And they wanted to know about
my story, to know about--

00:24:12.490 --> 00:24:15.660
to know why I decide
to come here, you know?

00:24:15.660 --> 00:24:19.350
And at the beginning, it
was a little bit difficult.

00:24:19.350 --> 00:24:20.940
It wasn't easy for me.

00:24:20.940 --> 00:24:23.425
Because I couldn't
like share my story.

00:24:23.425 --> 00:24:26.130
I couldn't tell
exactly what happened

00:24:26.130 --> 00:24:27.560
to me to people like this.

00:24:27.560 --> 00:24:29.100
No, I cannot like, just--

00:24:29.100 --> 00:24:29.820
I don't know you.

00:24:29.820 --> 00:24:32.820
I cannot just come and tell you
exactly what happened to me,

00:24:32.820 --> 00:24:33.670
you know?

00:24:33.670 --> 00:24:40.130
But after that, like,
with time and stuff,

00:24:40.130 --> 00:24:41.250
I just share my story.

00:24:41.250 --> 00:24:45.140
And right now I'm happy to do
that because they helped me.

00:24:45.140 --> 00:24:49.290
And at the same time, I meet
with Currey and Currey helped

00:24:49.290 --> 00:24:53.380
me to be a resident here.

00:24:53.380 --> 00:24:54.180
Yeah.

00:24:54.180 --> 00:24:55.200
And, yeah.

00:24:55.200 --> 00:25:02.890
That's how I can work here,
I can go to school, and yeah.

00:25:02.890 --> 00:25:06.939
That's basically
how I end up here.

00:25:06.939 --> 00:25:08.480
CURREY COOK: Do you
want to tell them

00:25:08.480 --> 00:25:10.271
a little bit about how
you were able to get

00:25:10.271 --> 00:25:11.660
your legal residency?

00:25:11.660 --> 00:25:15.180
SOUL: So, basically, as I said,
I was international student

00:25:15.180 --> 00:25:15.880
before.

00:25:15.880 --> 00:25:21.160
And international student here,
you cannot work, you cannot--

00:25:21.160 --> 00:25:23.630
you don't have a
social security,

00:25:23.630 --> 00:25:25.740
you don't have
working permit stuff.

00:25:25.740 --> 00:25:30.200
So, basically, when I
started working with Currey,

00:25:30.200 --> 00:25:33.800
he sent my paperwork
to Immigration, right?

00:25:33.800 --> 00:25:36.050
And before that, I was underage.

00:25:36.050 --> 00:25:37.610
I was 20.

00:25:37.610 --> 00:25:44.730
And then, so basically, I was
supposed to have a [INAUDIBLE].

00:25:47.360 --> 00:25:48.110
CURREY COOK: Yeah.

00:25:48.110 --> 00:25:50.240
It's called-- so
there's a provision

00:25:50.240 --> 00:25:52.670
in federal immigration law
called Special Immigrant

00:25:52.670 --> 00:25:54.560
Juvenile Status.

00:25:54.560 --> 00:25:58.620
So what it says is if you
have been abused, neglected,

00:25:58.620 --> 00:26:02.714
or abandoned by one or both of
your parents, you're under 21,

00:26:02.714 --> 00:26:04.880
you're unmarried, and it's
not in your best interest

00:26:04.880 --> 00:26:06.890
to go back to your
home country, then

00:26:06.890 --> 00:26:09.710
you can apply to
have a green card.

00:26:09.710 --> 00:26:14.090
And because of what happened
with Soul's dad, when Soul came

00:26:14.090 --> 00:26:16.910
out to his dad when he
was here, basically,

00:26:16.910 --> 00:26:18.980
he just completely cut him off.

00:26:18.980 --> 00:26:21.929
He was left here with nowhere
to go, no one to stay with.

00:26:21.929 --> 00:26:24.470
And then you want to tell them
how you ended up in the Bronx?

00:26:24.470 --> 00:26:25.850
SOUL: When I was
in San Francisco

00:26:25.850 --> 00:26:28.510
and I had this issue
with my family,

00:26:28.510 --> 00:26:30.140
I did not have anywhere to go.

00:26:30.140 --> 00:26:33.290
And how I'm going
to pay my rent,

00:26:33.290 --> 00:26:36.740
how I'm going to pay school
and stuff, that was my problem.

00:26:36.740 --> 00:26:41.570
And then I had one
friend in New York City.

00:26:41.570 --> 00:26:45.230
And when I asked him, like,
when I shared my story with him

00:26:45.230 --> 00:26:47.600
and I really tell
him like, right now

00:26:47.600 --> 00:26:51.960
I really need help
and stuff, and yeah.

00:26:51.960 --> 00:26:54.590
Him and his brothers,
they just told

00:26:54.590 --> 00:26:55.940
me to come to New York City.

00:26:55.940 --> 00:26:58.730
And that's how I ended
up in New York City.

00:26:58.730 --> 00:27:04.897
And I [INAUDIBLE], like, if
they weren't here for me,

00:27:04.897 --> 00:27:06.480
I don't know how I'm
going to be like.

00:27:06.480 --> 00:27:07.938
I don't know where
I'm going to go.

00:27:07.938 --> 00:27:10.010
Maybe I'm going to
be homeless maybe.

00:27:10.010 --> 00:27:10.520
You know?

00:27:10.520 --> 00:27:12.840
And that's how I went
to New York City.

00:27:12.840 --> 00:27:20.300
And at the same time, as I
said, we went [INAUDIBLE] when

00:27:20.300 --> 00:27:25.800
I went to the Bronx
court for my paperwork,

00:27:25.800 --> 00:27:29.860
one of my friend's
brother here, he

00:27:29.860 --> 00:27:32.360
accept to become my
guardian, you know?

00:27:32.360 --> 00:27:35.960
And that's how I
ended up to have

00:27:35.960 --> 00:27:38.090
my legal permanent residency.

00:27:38.090 --> 00:27:38.590
Yeah.

00:27:38.590 --> 00:27:39.340
CURREY COOK: Yeah.

00:27:39.340 --> 00:27:42.230
So one of the pieces of Special
Immigrant Juvenile Status

00:27:42.230 --> 00:27:44.990
is you have to be under the
jurisdiction of a family

00:27:44.990 --> 00:27:46.067
or juvenile court.

00:27:46.067 --> 00:27:48.650
That can be through foster care,
maybe because you're involved

00:27:48.650 --> 00:27:49.790
in a juvenile justice case.

00:27:49.790 --> 00:27:52.160
But it can also be because
someone is actually

00:27:52.160 --> 00:27:53.720
being your legal guardian.

00:27:53.720 --> 00:27:57.230
So Soul was staying with
this friend and their brother

00:27:57.230 --> 00:27:58.980
and they were actually
being his guardian.

00:27:58.980 --> 00:28:01.590
But they didn't have legal
paperwork that said that.

00:28:01.590 --> 00:28:04.680
So we went to court and had New
York City Family Court declare

00:28:04.680 --> 00:28:06.830
his friend his legal
guardian, and they

00:28:06.830 --> 00:28:08.930
were able to get these
findings that I mentioned

00:28:08.930 --> 00:28:10.367
and apply for
immigration status.

00:28:10.367 --> 00:28:12.200
And important for you
to know, while there's

00:28:12.200 --> 00:28:15.530
been a lot of attention
on Trump's travel ban

00:28:15.530 --> 00:28:18.200
and focus on refugees
from certain places,

00:28:18.200 --> 00:28:20.840
right, that there's
also rumblings

00:28:20.840 --> 00:28:24.680
that Congress may move to
take away Special Immigrant

00:28:24.680 --> 00:28:27.110
Juvenile Status entirely.

00:28:27.110 --> 00:28:28.490
So just be aware.

00:28:28.490 --> 00:28:31.610
You may be getting alerts from
us if that happens, right?

00:28:31.610 --> 00:28:34.190
So something that
is also in the works

00:28:34.190 --> 00:28:35.930
and all this kind
of bad stuff that's

00:28:35.930 --> 00:28:39.200
happening on the
immigration front.

00:28:39.200 --> 00:28:45.761
Maybe we can hear now from
Lydia, since you're up.

00:28:45.761 --> 00:28:47.510
Do you want to tell
us just a little bit--

00:28:47.510 --> 00:28:51.110
I mentioned you'd ended up in
the juvenile justice system.

00:28:51.110 --> 00:28:53.030
Do you want to just
kind of tell folks

00:28:53.030 --> 00:28:56.322
a little bit about how you
ended up there and a little bit

00:28:56.322 --> 00:28:58.280
about what your experiences
were like while you

00:28:58.280 --> 00:28:59.390
were in the facilities?

00:29:02.625 --> 00:29:03.125
LYDIA: Yeah.

00:29:07.180 --> 00:29:13.370
Well, I pretty much just
ended up in there from--

00:29:13.370 --> 00:29:19.480
when I was in school, I was
getting picked on like really,

00:29:19.480 --> 00:29:20.135
really bad.

00:29:23.140 --> 00:29:27.190
At the time, I
wasn't really open.

00:29:27.190 --> 00:29:30.351
But if someone asked, I
would, you know, tell him.

00:29:33.060 --> 00:29:35.640
Eventually, everybody ended
up knowing in the school.

00:29:35.640 --> 00:29:39.360
It got to a point to where at
the start of my eighth grade

00:29:39.360 --> 00:29:44.370
year, just, it got horrible.

00:29:44.370 --> 00:29:51.990
Like, I would get in fights
at school protecting myself.

00:29:51.990 --> 00:29:58.380
I would go home just
like everything's OK.

00:29:58.380 --> 00:30:00.840
Normally, everything
wasn't, with what

00:30:00.840 --> 00:30:04.000
was going on at school.

00:30:04.000 --> 00:30:10.290
And at one point it was like--

00:30:10.290 --> 00:30:17.370
I guess people was [? study ?]
coming towards me, threatening

00:30:17.370 --> 00:30:21.980
me, and someone had pushed
me down the stairs at school

00:30:21.980 --> 00:30:22.970
one time.

00:30:22.970 --> 00:30:25.895
I had got thrown up
against the lockers.

00:30:25.895 --> 00:30:28.360
And people was-- it was
all just stuff like that.

00:30:28.360 --> 00:30:34.660
And went into my
ninth grade year.

00:30:34.660 --> 00:30:36.790
It got way worse.

00:30:40.180 --> 00:30:44.340
People was-- it just
got to the point

00:30:44.340 --> 00:30:49.490
to where I had tried to
kill myself at one point.

00:30:49.490 --> 00:30:58.290
And, like, the best things
in the school that helped me

00:30:58.290 --> 00:31:01.820
stay calm, I'll say
calm, or, you know,

00:31:01.820 --> 00:31:05.385
helped me vent in different
ways, which was the theater

00:31:05.385 --> 00:31:12.880
arts and JROTC, it's
like a little [INAUDIBLE]

00:31:12.880 --> 00:31:16.780
like Army [INAUDIBLE] for
preparation things at school.

00:31:19.460 --> 00:31:21.730
They had kicked me
out of it because I

00:31:21.730 --> 00:31:26.380
had went to the detention center
because I had fought someone

00:31:26.380 --> 00:31:28.880
at home.

00:31:28.880 --> 00:31:31.840
And they had kicked
me out of it at school

00:31:31.840 --> 00:31:35.390
because they said they
it's a bad look on them.

00:31:35.390 --> 00:31:42.120
And eventually I
had ended up getting

00:31:42.120 --> 00:31:47.220
put in a residential treatment
center here in San Antonio.

00:31:47.220 --> 00:31:58.630
And they was-- sorry.

00:31:58.630 --> 00:32:06.473
They had youth come
after me sometimes, I

00:32:06.473 --> 00:32:08.760
guess I would say it like that.

00:32:08.760 --> 00:32:10.610
They had youth come
after me sometimes, you

00:32:10.610 --> 00:32:12.140
know, just to fight me.

00:32:12.140 --> 00:32:17.290
Because I was honest, I guess.

00:32:17.290 --> 00:32:17.890
I was honest.

00:32:17.890 --> 00:32:19.600
I spoke my mind.

00:32:19.600 --> 00:32:25.260
I really didn't hold
back on much to say.

00:32:25.260 --> 00:32:32.350
And if someone heard what I
said, they would turn it to,

00:32:32.350 --> 00:32:34.300
oh, I was trying
to flirt with them,

00:32:34.300 --> 00:32:38.320
or I was trying to hit
on them, something.

00:32:38.320 --> 00:32:47.320
And people have
ended up fighting me

00:32:47.320 --> 00:32:54.510
so much, back to back to back,
that I just gave up, I guess?

00:32:54.510 --> 00:32:56.470
And I just started
fighting everyone back.

00:32:59.980 --> 00:33:01.690
Then, a little bit
after that, they

00:33:01.690 --> 00:33:05.520
had kicked me out of that
place and put me back

00:33:05.520 --> 00:33:06.630
in the detention center.

00:33:06.630 --> 00:33:08.020
And I waited a few months.

00:33:08.020 --> 00:33:13.220
They put me in the Texas
Juvenile Justice Department,

00:33:13.220 --> 00:33:14.640
TJJD for short.

00:33:18.330 --> 00:33:25.500
In there, I have to say,
with the people jumping me

00:33:25.500 --> 00:33:29.010
and molesting me
because of who I am,

00:33:29.010 --> 00:33:34.070
it made it harder for me to
be able to do my treatment.

00:33:34.070 --> 00:33:38.170
With the staffs that [INAUDIBLE]
you different type of things.

00:33:38.170 --> 00:33:40.440
Contraband.

00:33:40.440 --> 00:33:43.770
They would give them food.

00:33:43.770 --> 00:33:46.130
They would give them
actual money sometimes.

00:33:46.130 --> 00:33:47.740
They would give
them razorblades,

00:33:47.740 --> 00:33:53.880
all types of stuff, to
get them to fight me.

00:33:53.880 --> 00:33:57.422
And sometimes it would be
staff that would actually

00:33:57.422 --> 00:33:59.040
try to fight me, too.

00:34:07.166 --> 00:34:11.810
It was really difficult
for me in there.

00:34:11.810 --> 00:34:14.310
I ended up in the
hospital several times

00:34:14.310 --> 00:34:17.384
because of the people
fighting me in general.

00:34:20.350 --> 00:34:27.820
Staff, my case manager,
had put in the database,

00:34:27.820 --> 00:34:28.738
I guess it's called.

00:34:28.738 --> 00:34:30.446
I don't really remember
what it's called.

00:34:30.446 --> 00:34:33.620
But she had put in
there that I should

00:34:33.620 --> 00:34:37.739
start acting more
masculine, and if I

00:34:37.739 --> 00:34:43.100
was were to act
more boyish or act

00:34:43.100 --> 00:34:48.739
straight I wouldn't
get beat up so much

00:34:48.739 --> 00:34:54.380
if I act, quote unquote,
"like a little girl."

00:34:59.150 --> 00:35:05.960
It made things really
difficult for me in general

00:35:05.960 --> 00:35:12.650
to just progress in the program.

00:35:12.650 --> 00:35:15.380
And then the halfway
house they had sent me to,

00:35:15.380 --> 00:35:21.570
before I had found out anything
of me going to a halfway house,

00:35:21.570 --> 00:35:23.600
they said that, oh,
you're going to go

00:35:23.600 --> 00:35:27.280
to a all-boys halfway house.

00:35:27.280 --> 00:35:30.500
And I was like, what is this?

00:35:34.650 --> 00:35:39.810
With that, they had promised
me all these different things.

00:35:39.810 --> 00:35:44.020
But when I got there, it
was the total opposite.

00:35:44.020 --> 00:35:48.610
Like they promised me that
I would have my own room.

00:35:48.610 --> 00:35:52.415
I wouldn't be roomed with any
other youth or any other boys.

00:35:57.550 --> 00:36:05.340
I would be able to dress
and act freely, as I choose.

00:36:05.340 --> 00:36:09.920
And, also, they said
that I would be able--

00:36:09.920 --> 00:36:12.710
if I was were to
go on a home pass,

00:36:12.710 --> 00:36:17.930
I could come back with hair
extensions or my nails done,

00:36:17.930 --> 00:36:20.900
or makeup, or whatever.

00:36:20.900 --> 00:36:23.560
And even the money
I would have made

00:36:23.560 --> 00:36:25.330
while I was in
the halfway house,

00:36:25.330 --> 00:36:29.800
they said that I would be
able to spend it on things

00:36:29.800 --> 00:36:32.280
that I choose.

00:36:32.280 --> 00:36:37.110
Now, when I got there,
they changed all of that.

00:36:37.110 --> 00:36:39.390
Like, it was just, no.

00:36:39.390 --> 00:36:40.330
You can't do this.

00:36:40.330 --> 00:36:43.040
You can't do that.

00:36:43.040 --> 00:36:47.320
I had got threatened
by a youth there.

00:36:47.320 --> 00:36:50.270
He had said that he was
going to call his sister

00:36:50.270 --> 00:36:57.970
and have her come and shoot
me because of pretty much

00:36:57.970 --> 00:36:59.100
how I present myself.

00:36:59.100 --> 00:37:02.640
And just through that
whole time it was just--

00:37:08.130 --> 00:37:14.700
it was just hard to be
able to have them say, you

00:37:14.700 --> 00:37:20.730
can be yourself but
you can't be yourself

00:37:20.730 --> 00:37:26.210
if this is what you
are trying to be.

00:37:26.210 --> 00:37:28.582
They were contradicting
themselves, pretty much.

00:37:28.582 --> 00:37:30.030
And I was like,
how are you going

00:37:30.030 --> 00:37:35.400
to say that I can be myself,
I can dress how I want,

00:37:35.400 --> 00:37:39.720
and all this other
stuff, but then you

00:37:39.720 --> 00:37:42.550
scratch out the part for
homosexuals or anyone

00:37:42.550 --> 00:37:45.052
in the LGBTQ community.

00:37:45.052 --> 00:37:47.160
And you say they
can't be themselves,

00:37:47.160 --> 00:37:49.995
but the other ones can.

00:37:49.995 --> 00:37:51.360
[INAUDIBLE]

00:37:51.360 --> 00:37:53.110
CURREY COOK: Let me
just pause right there

00:37:53.110 --> 00:37:55.400
and just tell everyone a
little bit of background.

00:37:55.400 --> 00:38:00.670
So Lydia has had an amazing,
supportive mom throughout.

00:38:00.670 --> 00:38:04.810
And during her year and a
half time in these facilities,

00:38:04.810 --> 00:38:08.200
her mom was calling and
complaining about her treatment

00:38:08.200 --> 00:38:09.730
and eventually
called our help desk,

00:38:09.730 --> 00:38:12.880
which is how we got
connected with Lydia

00:38:12.880 --> 00:38:17.350
and gathered all records, which
documented all the things she

00:38:17.350 --> 00:38:19.390
was saying, being
repeatedly assaulted,

00:38:19.390 --> 00:38:22.109
not being protected,
going to the hospital

00:38:22.109 --> 00:38:24.400
because kids were beating
her up because of how she was

00:38:24.400 --> 00:38:29.080
expressing herself, not
acknowledging that at the time,

00:38:29.080 --> 00:38:33.100
Lydia was basically expressing,
I identify as female.

00:38:33.100 --> 00:38:34.480
I want to be treated as female.

00:38:34.480 --> 00:38:37.780
But being absolutely
shut down in all of that.

00:38:37.780 --> 00:38:41.050
And eventually, when
we wrote a big letter

00:38:41.050 --> 00:38:43.334
and had a big meeting,
and then suddenly she

00:38:43.334 --> 00:38:45.250
was able to get out even
though she hadn't met

00:38:45.250 --> 00:38:46.900
her levels in two years, right?

00:38:46.900 --> 00:38:48.860
But even then they
wanted to place

00:38:48.860 --> 00:38:52.060
Lydia at this halfway house
for boys, which we opposed.

00:38:52.060 --> 00:38:55.262
But when she got there, she
said to the superintendent,

00:38:55.262 --> 00:38:57.470
you know, they told me I'd
be able to express myself.

00:38:57.470 --> 00:38:59.477
And the superintendent
said, well no,

00:38:59.477 --> 00:39:01.060
because the only
reason you'd be doing

00:39:01.060 --> 00:39:04.660
that is to try to seduce
the other boys in the room.

00:39:04.660 --> 00:39:07.540
I mean, just kind of
just ridiculous stuff.

00:39:07.540 --> 00:39:10.530
And Texas actually has sexual
orientation and gender identity

00:39:10.530 --> 00:39:12.680
as protected classes
in their policy.

00:39:12.680 --> 00:39:14.230
But obviously that
wasn't translating

00:39:14.230 --> 00:39:15.400
into the staff and work.

00:39:15.400 --> 00:39:16.775
So going back to
what I mentioned

00:39:16.775 --> 00:39:18.870
earlier about training
being critical, right?

00:39:18.870 --> 00:39:22.330
This is a good example of staff
doing this stuff that's clearly

00:39:22.330 --> 00:39:24.640
not good for young people.

00:39:24.640 --> 00:39:27.070
And, you know, and
Lydia actively getting

00:39:27.070 --> 00:39:28.540
hurt, right, as a part of it.

00:39:28.540 --> 00:39:31.120
So the good news
is that Lydia was

00:39:31.120 --> 00:39:35.050
able to get out of the halfway
house soon, back with her mom,

00:39:35.050 --> 00:39:37.410
had a really affirming and
amazing parole officer,

00:39:37.410 --> 00:39:41.247
is off parole, working
now, and doing awesome.

00:39:41.247 --> 00:39:42.080
So that's good news.

00:39:42.080 --> 00:39:46.210
So why don't we turn
and hear from Savannah.

00:39:46.210 --> 00:39:47.440
You ready?

00:39:47.440 --> 00:39:48.570
Savannah?

00:39:48.570 --> 00:39:51.130
So why don't you tell
folks a little bit about--

00:39:51.130 --> 00:39:54.202
you're in foster
care now, why don't

00:39:54.202 --> 00:39:56.530
you tell them a little
about where you are now,

00:39:56.530 --> 00:39:58.720
and how that is, and then
a little bit about how

00:39:58.720 --> 00:40:01.217
you got into care?

00:40:01.217 --> 00:40:02.050
SAVANNAH: All right.

00:40:02.050 --> 00:40:08.156
First I think we should give
Lydia and Soul some applause.

00:40:08.156 --> 00:40:11.558
[APPLAUSE]

00:40:13.990 --> 00:40:16.941
I was very moved by
both of your stories.

00:40:16.941 --> 00:40:18.190
So thank you for sharing them.

00:40:21.040 --> 00:40:23.830
I am currently living
in what's called

00:40:23.830 --> 00:40:26.350
a supervised
independent living home.

00:40:29.210 --> 00:40:31.890
And it's a girls' home.

00:40:31.890 --> 00:40:37.710
And all of the other youth
here have been very affirming.

00:40:37.710 --> 00:40:39.900
And the staff has definitely
been very affirming.

00:40:39.900 --> 00:40:43.850
And it's a good place.

00:40:43.850 --> 00:40:47.230
I basically have my own
efficiency apartment.

00:40:47.230 --> 00:40:54.520
And it's basically
teaching us to-- it's kind

00:40:54.520 --> 00:40:59.650
of like a halfway house from
leaving foster care going

00:40:59.650 --> 00:41:04.040
into the real world, you
know, and becoming an adult.

00:41:04.040 --> 00:41:09.190
And I think it's a
very good place for me.

00:41:09.190 --> 00:41:15.220
As far as how I got here, I was
living with my parents for--

00:41:15.220 --> 00:41:17.540
I lived with them for 16 years.

00:41:17.540 --> 00:41:21.910
And I was always very,
very close with my mom.

00:41:21.910 --> 00:41:27.380
And I had a really
good childhood.

00:41:27.380 --> 00:41:31.550
I am glad to say that I
have very good memories

00:41:31.550 --> 00:41:36.200
from my childhood.

00:41:36.200 --> 00:41:43.900
And my mom always says
I was a wonderful child,

00:41:43.900 --> 00:41:46.510
a wonderful toddler
and child, and then

00:41:46.510 --> 00:41:49.810
once I got to my
teenage years, that's

00:41:49.810 --> 00:41:55.835
when things kind of started
to get a little bit shaky.

00:41:55.835 --> 00:41:58.090
I was going through
a lot of depression.

00:41:58.090 --> 00:42:05.700
And it was not entirely
because, but it

00:42:05.700 --> 00:42:09.720
had a lot to do
with, the fact that I

00:42:09.720 --> 00:42:14.160
felt as though I could not
come out as trans because I

00:42:14.160 --> 00:42:18.640
knew around 14 or 15.

00:42:18.640 --> 00:42:22.220
And the thing is,
I couldn't come out

00:42:22.220 --> 00:42:31.220
because my parents-- my dad
is a pastor at our church.

00:42:31.220 --> 00:42:40.950
And very, you know, I don't
want to say anti-LGBT,

00:42:40.950 --> 00:42:45.930
but not affirming
most definitely.

00:42:45.930 --> 00:42:54.110
And so eventually
it just kind of--

00:42:54.110 --> 00:42:56.310
I just kind of blew up one day.

00:42:56.310 --> 00:43:04.900
And I actually had
come out to my parents

00:43:04.900 --> 00:43:06.330
through a suicide note.

00:43:06.330 --> 00:43:09.460
So I was [INAUDIBLE] suicide.

00:43:09.460 --> 00:43:12.650
And then we went to counseling.

00:43:12.650 --> 00:43:14.660
And things started
to get better.

00:43:14.660 --> 00:43:17.240
But they still
weren't affirming.

00:43:17.240 --> 00:43:22.440
They knew, which was better
than before, I suppose, but they

00:43:22.440 --> 00:43:23.190
weren't affirming.

00:43:23.190 --> 00:43:26.760
So it wasn't a whole lot better.

00:43:26.760 --> 00:43:33.870
And then one time--

00:43:33.870 --> 00:43:35.470
yeah.

00:43:35.470 --> 00:43:38.140
It was soon after my
16th birthday, I think.

00:43:42.380 --> 00:44:00.300
I had ended up in a psych ward
because of suicidal ideations

00:44:00.300 --> 00:44:02.580
because I was still
wasn't allowed to come out

00:44:02.580 --> 00:44:03.760
to anyone else, really.

00:44:03.760 --> 00:44:09.431
And it's not--

00:44:09.431 --> 00:44:11.430
I guess it's not the
hardest thing in the world,

00:44:11.430 --> 00:44:17.540
but it's not easy to have
to hide all the time.

00:44:17.540 --> 00:44:25.110
And my first foster home
that I was placed in--

00:44:25.110 --> 00:44:27.210
oh yeah, well, I
couldn't go back home.

00:44:27.210 --> 00:44:30.160
So I had to be placed
in foster care.

00:44:30.160 --> 00:44:34.710
So the first foster home
that I was placed in

00:44:34.710 --> 00:44:37.950
was definitely not affirming.

00:44:37.950 --> 00:44:40.540
And the agency wasn't affirming.

00:44:40.540 --> 00:44:48.080
And it was-- once
again, I was closeted.

00:44:48.080 --> 00:44:52.130
And I had to just go
to school as a boy

00:44:52.130 --> 00:44:54.470
and live my life as
a boy and, you know--

00:45:02.146 --> 00:45:03.520
first of all, it
wasn't pleasant.

00:45:03.520 --> 00:45:07.540
But second, it was
entirely counterproductive.

00:45:07.540 --> 00:45:09.160
The entire reason
that I was placed

00:45:09.160 --> 00:45:14.440
in care in the first
place was because

00:45:14.440 --> 00:45:21.350
of problems at home relating
to my gender identity

00:45:21.350 --> 00:45:22.160
not being affirmed.

00:45:25.630 --> 00:45:31.210
So I was removed from that
situation with my parents

00:45:31.210 --> 00:45:35.350
and put into an
identical situation.

00:45:35.350 --> 00:45:39.230
The only thing that's changed
is where I am and who I'm with.

00:45:39.230 --> 00:45:40.730
The situation
itself is the same.

00:45:40.730 --> 00:45:44.210
So it just wasn't--

00:45:48.690 --> 00:45:50.790
I don't think it
was a logical move.

00:45:50.790 --> 00:45:55.080
And then there
were other problems

00:45:55.080 --> 00:45:58.380
at that home entirely unrelated
to my gender identity.

00:45:58.380 --> 00:46:03.300
And, ultimately, I was
removed from that home

00:46:03.300 --> 00:46:04.554
for those reasons.

00:46:04.554 --> 00:46:06.970
And it didn't have anything
to do with my gender identity.

00:46:06.970 --> 00:46:09.330
But then I was
placed in a new home.

00:46:09.330 --> 00:46:10.830
They also weren't affirming.

00:46:10.830 --> 00:46:15.570
But I was allowed
to be out at school.

00:46:15.570 --> 00:46:28.100
I was allowed to express myself
through how I present myself,

00:46:28.100 --> 00:46:34.690
how I dress, my name and
pronouns, how I introduce

00:46:34.690 --> 00:46:37.195
myself to people, et cetera.

00:46:37.195 --> 00:46:38.570
CURREY COOK: And
Savannah, so you

00:46:38.570 --> 00:46:42.820
were at school in a pretty rural
area in Pennsylvania, right?

00:46:42.820 --> 00:46:43.840
SAVANNAH: Oh, yes.

00:46:43.840 --> 00:46:44.350
Yeah.

00:46:44.350 --> 00:46:46.720
All three of these
placements my ho--

00:46:46.720 --> 00:46:47.286
I'm sorry?

00:46:47.286 --> 00:46:48.410
CURREY COOK: No, that's OK.

00:46:48.410 --> 00:46:49.940
Go ahead.

00:46:49.940 --> 00:46:55.880
SAVANNAH: All three of
my placements-- my home,

00:46:55.880 --> 00:46:58.540
my first foster home, and
then this second foster home--

00:46:58.540 --> 00:47:02.500
they were all very rural areas.

00:47:02.500 --> 00:47:13.020
And it's not that the people
at school weren't accepting.

00:47:13.020 --> 00:47:19.000
I think they just didn't know
how to react to it, I guess.

00:47:19.000 --> 00:47:19.650
I'm not sure.

00:47:19.650 --> 00:47:27.590
They had never-- transgender
people aren't exactly plentiful

00:47:27.590 --> 00:47:29.750
in schools such as that.

00:47:29.750 --> 00:47:34.180
And not that there was any
stigma against people like me.

00:47:34.180 --> 00:47:40.970
They just didn't know anything
about transgender people

00:47:40.970 --> 00:47:44.000
or the community.

00:47:44.000 --> 00:47:48.270
And they-- I feel like
I made a lot of people

00:47:48.270 --> 00:47:53.430
feel awkward just
by being there.

00:47:53.430 --> 00:47:54.762
It wasn't--

00:47:54.762 --> 00:47:55.720
CURREY COOK: I'm sorry.

00:47:55.720 --> 00:47:57.180
I remember you
telling me that it

00:47:57.180 --> 00:48:00.420
didn't seem like the people
running the foster care

00:48:00.420 --> 00:48:03.150
agencies and from the
county knew anything

00:48:03.150 --> 00:48:04.800
about working with
transgender youth

00:48:04.800 --> 00:48:06.045
or had ever had any training

00:48:06.045 --> 00:48:08.710
SAVANNAH: Oh yeah,
they didn't either, no.

00:48:08.710 --> 00:48:12.310
CURREY COOK: And can you
tell everyone a little bit--

00:48:12.310 --> 00:48:15.260
I know you had a particular
issue around clothing when

00:48:15.260 --> 00:48:17.070
you wanted to get clothing.

00:48:17.070 --> 00:48:18.070
Do you want to tell us--

00:48:18.070 --> 00:48:21.010
SAVANNAH: Yeah.

00:48:21.010 --> 00:48:22.810
So, yes.

00:48:22.810 --> 00:48:26.650
The agency was
very non-affirming.

00:48:26.650 --> 00:48:35.070
And I can deal with
misgendering and calling me

00:48:35.070 --> 00:48:35.940
by the wrong name.

00:48:35.940 --> 00:48:38.970
I mean, people are going
to do that all the time.

00:48:38.970 --> 00:48:40.120
And my parents do that.

00:48:40.120 --> 00:48:42.900
And I still love them to death.

00:48:42.900 --> 00:48:51.160
But, you know, Currey
talked in a slideshow

00:48:51.160 --> 00:49:01.845
about not discriminating
based on gender.

00:49:04.360 --> 00:49:06.360
Like not even just
gender identity.

00:49:06.360 --> 00:49:09.380
Just on your biological sex.

00:49:09.380 --> 00:49:12.710
I mean, they would--

00:49:12.710 --> 00:49:18.530
OK, so they provide each child
a clothing allotment of--

00:49:18.530 --> 00:49:25.340
but it was some monthly
clothing allotment

00:49:25.340 --> 00:49:30.410
so we can go out and buy
clothing for ourselves to wear.

00:49:30.410 --> 00:49:35.220
And so it had to be--

00:49:35.220 --> 00:49:38.610
in the guidelines, it said
that you have the right

00:49:38.610 --> 00:49:45.810
to spend your clothing allotment
on gender-appropriate items

00:49:45.810 --> 00:49:46.470
of clothing.

00:49:46.470 --> 00:49:53.600
And so they restricted
me to only be

00:49:53.600 --> 00:49:55.490
allowed to buy boys' clothes.

00:49:55.490 --> 00:49:57.710
And, of course, you
know, the definition

00:49:57.710 --> 00:50:01.910
of what boys' clothes
are is arbitrary.

00:50:01.910 --> 00:50:09.160
But I guess what they
deemed to be boys' clothes

00:50:09.160 --> 00:50:10.820
was all I was allowed to buy.

00:50:10.820 --> 00:50:12.020
So I ended up--

00:50:12.020 --> 00:50:17.355
before the first day of school,
I had to buy a new wardrobe.

00:50:19.870 --> 00:50:22.330
$200 worth of clothes with--

00:50:22.330 --> 00:50:27.320
no, $280 something, actually,
of clothes with my own money

00:50:27.320 --> 00:50:28.010
out of pocket.

00:50:28.010 --> 00:50:31.400
And, of course, like it--

00:50:31.400 --> 00:50:34.040
sometimes it sounds like--

00:50:34.040 --> 00:50:36.260
it's probably sounds
to some people

00:50:36.260 --> 00:50:38.690
like it's really
not that big a deal.

00:50:38.690 --> 00:50:41.530
So they won't buy you
the clothes you want.

00:50:41.530 --> 00:50:49.850
But it's that they won't
buy me clothes that they

00:50:49.850 --> 00:50:51.460
would buy for another youth.

00:50:51.460 --> 00:50:55.220
And they're doing it solely
based on my sex, what

00:50:55.220 --> 00:50:57.810
I was assigned at birth.

00:50:57.810 --> 00:51:01.550
CURREY COOK: Let me
pause you right there,

00:51:01.550 --> 00:51:04.210
because I think we want to
leave some time for questions.

00:51:04.210 --> 00:51:09.260
And then I just want to say that
this is when Savannah called

00:51:09.260 --> 00:51:12.740
our help desk line because she
sort of knew, like, OK, this

00:51:12.740 --> 00:51:14.850
is clearly not right.

00:51:14.850 --> 00:51:16.330
You know?

00:51:16.330 --> 00:51:19.530
I don't know what the law
says, but this is not OK.

00:51:19.530 --> 00:51:22.100
And I think it really
puts a fine point on what

00:51:22.100 --> 00:51:23.160
we're talking about here.

00:51:23.160 --> 00:51:25.285
Like when you're in these
out-of-home care systems,

00:51:25.285 --> 00:51:27.450
the state controls
your whole life,

00:51:27.450 --> 00:51:30.266
including the clothes that
you wear, right, and can buy.

00:51:30.266 --> 00:51:31.265
So they were basically--

00:51:31.265 --> 00:51:32.480
[? LYDIA: ?] And
whether you're out.

00:51:32.480 --> 00:51:33.700
CURREY COOK: And
whether you're out.

00:51:33.700 --> 00:51:34.200
Right?

00:51:34.200 --> 00:51:36.780
So they were basically
saying, oh, by the way,

00:51:36.780 --> 00:51:39.450
gender is not defined anywhere.

00:51:39.450 --> 00:51:42.830
So we're just going to say
it's gender assigned at birth

00:51:42.830 --> 00:51:46.790
and deny a young person the
clothing that not only they

00:51:46.790 --> 00:51:51.020
want as a baseline, right, but
also that actually helps affirm

00:51:51.020 --> 00:51:56.240
their identity, which drops all
of these awful outcomes, right?

00:51:56.240 --> 00:51:58.800
Suicidal ideation, depression,
and all this stuff.

00:51:58.800 --> 00:52:01.790
And child welfare
agencies have to legally

00:52:01.790 --> 00:52:04.940
make sure you're safe,
they are responsible

00:52:04.940 --> 00:52:08.510
for your well-being, and
are going against everything

00:52:08.510 --> 00:52:11.540
that any professional standard
says about how you're supposed

00:52:11.540 --> 00:52:12.970
to respond to LGBT youth.

00:52:12.970 --> 00:52:18.270
So I think, you know, Lydia
and Savannah's examples

00:52:18.270 --> 00:52:21.640
really show, you know,
what a long way we

00:52:21.640 --> 00:52:24.979
have to go in these systems
to affirm trans youth

00:52:24.979 --> 00:52:27.270
and how they really bear the
brunt of all these things,

00:52:27.270 --> 00:52:28.490
right?

00:52:28.490 --> 00:52:31.820
And the good news,
though, is that Savannah

00:52:31.820 --> 00:52:34.645
was affirmed in a school,
right, in rural Pennsylvania.

00:52:34.645 --> 00:52:36.770
And I think that's a good
takeaway with the Supreme

00:52:36.770 --> 00:52:39.020
Court kicking the
Gavin Grimm case back

00:52:39.020 --> 00:52:42.680
down to the 4th Circuit
court of appeals.

00:52:42.680 --> 00:52:46.040
It still may be a bit before we
get these issues to the Supreme

00:52:46.040 --> 00:52:46.640
Court.

00:52:46.640 --> 00:52:48.830
Could be a good thing,
may be a bad thing,

00:52:48.830 --> 00:52:50.840
depending on the makeup
of the Supreme Court.

00:52:50.840 --> 00:52:52.340
But in the meantime,
there are a lot

00:52:52.340 --> 00:52:54.089
of schools that are
doing the right thing.

00:52:54.089 --> 00:52:56.060
And I think hearing
their positive stories is

00:52:56.060 --> 00:52:58.220
a good reminder to us
of the good stuff that's

00:52:58.220 --> 00:52:59.480
going on out there, too.

00:52:59.480 --> 00:53:01.370
So I'll turn it over
to Alex now and see

00:53:01.370 --> 00:53:02.979
if anybody has questions.

00:53:02.979 --> 00:53:06.262
[APPLAUSE]

00:53:07.925 --> 00:53:10.050
ALEX: The question was,
what is your interpretation

00:53:10.050 --> 00:53:12.682
of the recent decision not
to hear the Gavin Grimm case?

00:53:12.682 --> 00:53:14.640
What does it mean in
general for interpretation

00:53:14.640 --> 00:53:16.690
that transgender people
are protected by sex

00:53:16.690 --> 00:53:18.610
anti-discrimination laws?

00:53:18.610 --> 00:53:21.630
CURREY COOK: So you all may have
followed that during the Obama

00:53:21.630 --> 00:53:23.790
administration, the
Department of Justice

00:53:23.790 --> 00:53:27.120
issued these guidelines to
the school district saying,

00:53:27.120 --> 00:53:30.000
basically, Title IX, which
protects against discrimination

00:53:30.000 --> 00:53:32.280
in schools based
on sex, that that

00:53:32.280 --> 00:53:35.700
means you should
comply with the law,

00:53:35.700 --> 00:53:39.080
affirm transgender
students at school.

00:53:39.080 --> 00:53:42.192
And so the case that the
ACLU had with Gavin Grimm

00:53:42.192 --> 00:53:43.650
sort of wound up
through the courts

00:53:43.650 --> 00:53:46.110
and then the appellate
court basically

00:53:46.110 --> 00:53:48.630
decided on that guidance.

00:53:48.630 --> 00:53:51.810
And so then, as the Supreme
Court was considering

00:53:51.810 --> 00:53:55.650
what to do with it, and it was
scheduled for oral argument,

00:53:55.650 --> 00:53:58.500
the Trump administration
rescinded that guidance

00:53:58.500 --> 00:54:03.270
and basically said, states, do
what you want, whatever, right?

00:54:03.270 --> 00:54:04.837
Don't bully
transgender students.

00:54:04.837 --> 00:54:06.420
But oh, by the way,
you don't actually

00:54:06.420 --> 00:54:08.460
have to affirm their identity.

00:54:08.460 --> 00:54:10.800
Which, of course, you can't
have both of those things

00:54:10.800 --> 00:54:12.660
at the same time.

00:54:12.660 --> 00:54:14.820
But the Supreme Court
then said, all right,

00:54:14.820 --> 00:54:17.089
well, we're actually just
going to-- if this was based

00:54:17.089 --> 00:54:19.380
on the guidance and the Trump
administration pulled it,

00:54:19.380 --> 00:54:21.120
we're just going to
kick this back down

00:54:21.120 --> 00:54:23.140
to the appellate
court to decide it.

00:54:23.140 --> 00:54:24.600
And that's kind of
where it is now.

00:54:24.600 --> 00:54:26.397
So they're going to
be deciding again.

00:54:26.397 --> 00:54:28.230
That could result in a
really good decision,

00:54:28.230 --> 00:54:31.050
as most courts
have said Title IX,

00:54:31.050 --> 00:54:33.540
the sex protection means
you can't discriminate

00:54:33.540 --> 00:54:34.930
based on gender identity.

00:54:34.930 --> 00:54:37.170
But obviously we're
worried about who's

00:54:37.170 --> 00:54:39.660
going to be on
the Supreme Court.

00:54:39.660 --> 00:54:43.200
And so if another
justice or two drops off

00:54:43.200 --> 00:54:44.700
and we have a
conservative majority,

00:54:44.700 --> 00:54:47.190
that could be really
bad for a decision

00:54:47.190 --> 00:54:49.930
like that one going back up.

00:54:49.930 --> 00:54:53.190
ALEX: I wanted to ask
Soul specifically,

00:54:53.190 --> 00:54:56.090
with kind of the new
administration and this focus

00:54:56.090 --> 00:54:58.590
on immigration-- this is such
an issue we were hearing about

00:54:58.590 --> 00:55:00.990
constantly throughout
the campaign--

00:55:00.990 --> 00:55:02.660
and with this kind
of refugee ban

00:55:02.660 --> 00:55:04.910
that's happened, how has
that affected you personally?

00:55:04.910 --> 00:55:06.326
I know there's
legal implications.

00:55:06.326 --> 00:55:08.010
But do you think
that there's ways

00:55:08.010 --> 00:55:10.821
that it's affected you
beyond that as well?

00:55:10.821 --> 00:55:11.320
SOUL: Yeah.

00:55:11.320 --> 00:55:16.860
So, basically, I feel a
little bit sad about it

00:55:16.860 --> 00:55:18.972
because I'm an
immigrant, of course.

00:55:18.972 --> 00:55:24.710
I'm not a citizen.

00:55:24.710 --> 00:55:27.780
And at the same time,
I'm just going to like--

00:55:27.780 --> 00:55:32.330
I'm not going to talk about
like only how this affect me

00:55:32.330 --> 00:55:36.690
as a LGBT, but as
a person, you know?

00:55:36.690 --> 00:55:38.860
Because we know here
in the United States

00:55:38.860 --> 00:55:41.460
there is a lot of
immigrant people, you know?

00:55:41.460 --> 00:55:43.934
So, basically, if
we see, for example,

00:55:43.934 --> 00:55:46.350
like if you take an example
of, well, Google, for example,

00:55:46.350 --> 00:55:47.050
here.

00:55:47.050 --> 00:55:53.490
How many immigrant people
work for Google, you know?

00:55:53.490 --> 00:55:56.400
Or Facebook, or other
companies, you know?

00:55:56.400 --> 00:56:01.983
I think the United States
is a free country, you know?

00:56:01.983 --> 00:56:09.420
Is American and other people,
too, contribute to the economy,

00:56:09.420 --> 00:56:10.680
you know, and stuff, you know.

00:56:10.680 --> 00:56:14.520
And as we see, if
we have to kick out

00:56:14.520 --> 00:56:16.020
all the immigrant
people, it's going

00:56:16.020 --> 00:56:19.620
to be bad for immigrant
people first and also

00:56:19.620 --> 00:56:21.540
for American people, too.

00:56:21.540 --> 00:56:25.146
Because we all contribute
to develop America

00:56:25.146 --> 00:56:29.550
and we all contribute to make
America great, as people say,

00:56:29.550 --> 00:56:30.810
you know?

00:56:30.810 --> 00:56:31.310
You know?

00:56:31.310 --> 00:56:32.230
And yeah.

00:56:32.230 --> 00:56:36.350
I feel bad about it, and I think
it's something we cannot let

00:56:36.350 --> 00:56:38.640
happen, you know.

00:56:38.640 --> 00:56:42.330
And that's how I feel
about it, you know.

00:56:42.330 --> 00:56:45.540
And I want to say
also it affects me

00:56:45.540 --> 00:56:50.100
as LGBT because if I
have to leave here,

00:56:50.100 --> 00:56:52.416
where I'm going to go?

00:56:52.416 --> 00:56:54.780
Not back in my country.

00:56:54.780 --> 00:56:58.480
If I go back in
my country, how--

00:56:58.480 --> 00:57:02.140
I don't know what
going to happen to me.

00:57:02.140 --> 00:57:03.670
I got nowhere else
to go, you know.

00:57:03.670 --> 00:57:08.110
Like, I got no family, I got
no place to stay, you know?

00:57:08.110 --> 00:57:13.270
And as what I want to
add, too, is people,

00:57:13.270 --> 00:57:16.935
when they heard about Africa,
they don't see really,

00:57:16.935 --> 00:57:21.730
like, African people, too,
they have a LGBT community

00:57:21.730 --> 00:57:24.420
over there, they did have too.

00:57:24.420 --> 00:57:25.490
It's not like here.

00:57:25.490 --> 00:57:27.500
People are like,
if you see like--

00:57:27.500 --> 00:57:31.100
if you compare America to
Africa, it's like this kind.

00:57:31.100 --> 00:57:35.840
Like you have a big difference
between them, you know?

00:57:35.840 --> 00:57:39.180
And as I say it, in Africa,
we don't have LGBT--

00:57:39.180 --> 00:57:40.920
we don't have LGBT Center.

00:57:40.920 --> 00:57:42.860
We don't have LGBT community.

00:57:42.860 --> 00:57:46.680
We don't have organizations who
work for LGBT people, you know?

00:57:46.680 --> 00:57:50.540
We don't have an
organization [INAUDIBLE].

00:57:50.540 --> 00:57:53.250
If LGBT people,
they have a problem

00:57:53.250 --> 00:57:58.570
or you have like discrimination
or something, where

00:57:58.570 --> 00:58:03.530
you going to go to [INAUDIBLE],
to claim your right, you know?

00:58:03.530 --> 00:58:05.690
There's no rights for
LGBT people in Africa,

00:58:05.690 --> 00:58:07.310
in some countries in Africa.

00:58:07.310 --> 00:58:09.630
And we have to be aware of that.

00:58:09.630 --> 00:58:12.970
And that's why I like
all the time, when

00:58:12.970 --> 00:58:15.870
I decide to go to speak
and to share my story,

00:58:15.870 --> 00:58:18.740
I just want to mention that
for people to be aware of that.

00:58:18.740 --> 00:58:21.470
Like, it's not only
about, like, America here.

00:58:21.470 --> 00:58:24.110
LGBT people, they-- yeah.

00:58:24.110 --> 00:58:27.800
Here we have discrimination
and stuff, yeah.

00:58:27.800 --> 00:58:30.050
But in Africa, too, we have it.

00:58:30.050 --> 00:58:35.910
In Africa, like, people over
there, too, we need help, too.

00:58:35.910 --> 00:58:38.020
LGBT community is
a LGBT community.

00:58:38.020 --> 00:58:40.850
Like, African LGBT community,
American LGBT community,

00:58:40.850 --> 00:58:41.900
doesn't matter, you know?

00:58:41.900 --> 00:58:43.130
We all LGBT community.

00:58:43.130 --> 00:58:47.466
And I think we have to think
about them, too, you know?

00:58:47.466 --> 00:58:48.050
Yeah.

00:58:48.050 --> 00:58:49.532
That's everything I have to say.

00:58:49.532 --> 00:58:51.740
CURREY COOK: And then I
think Alex was saying to you,

00:58:51.740 --> 00:58:53.030
wondering what we can do.

00:58:53.030 --> 00:58:54.980
I mean, I think one
thing is making sure

00:58:54.980 --> 00:58:57.290
that when we're
talking about refugees

00:58:57.290 --> 00:58:59.570
or unaccompanied
children that come

00:58:59.570 --> 00:59:02.810
is that there are obviously a
lot of those folks who identify

00:59:02.810 --> 00:59:04.340
across the LGBT spectrum.

00:59:04.340 --> 00:59:06.910
And so being sent
back to your country

00:59:06.910 --> 00:59:09.660
would be horrific for
a variety of reasons.

00:59:09.660 --> 00:59:12.770
But particularly for LGBT
people, as Soul was describing,

00:59:12.770 --> 00:59:14.240
it's a whole other thing, right?

00:59:14.240 --> 00:59:16.580
So speaking up about
that, that the stakes

00:59:16.580 --> 00:59:18.320
are so high for
some of these people

00:59:18.320 --> 00:59:21.080
going back to countries where
they may be killed, right?

00:59:21.080 --> 00:59:24.080
Or just being who
they are is illegal.

00:59:24.080 --> 00:59:27.710
AUDIENCE: So the
recent executive order

00:59:27.710 --> 00:59:30.265
is pretty clear on its policy
towards refugee resettlement

00:59:30.265 --> 00:59:32.990
for the next 120 days.

00:59:32.990 --> 00:59:37.040
It's not super clear on its
treatment of current asylum

00:59:37.040 --> 00:59:40.630
seekers, those with pending
cases in the United States.

00:59:40.630 --> 00:59:43.800
And just on the topic of
international LGBT folks

00:59:43.800 --> 00:59:45.860
who have actually made
it to the United States,

00:59:45.860 --> 00:59:49.520
but not as refugees whose
cases are currently pending,

00:59:49.520 --> 00:59:51.140
given your legal
expertise, what is

00:59:51.140 --> 00:59:55.490
your knowledge of the likelihood
of those cases being processed

00:59:55.490 --> 00:59:56.090
at all?

00:59:56.090 --> 00:59:58.520
Or what can those folks expect?

00:59:58.520 --> 00:59:59.270
CURREY COOK: Yeah.

00:59:59.270 --> 01:00:00.978
I mean, first of all,
I think that we all

01:00:00.978 --> 01:00:03.016
know there's like
a huge backlog,

01:00:03.016 --> 01:00:04.390
generally, in
immigration courts.

01:00:04.390 --> 01:00:07.820
Like another client of
mine who's from Ghana,

01:00:07.820 --> 01:00:13.289
he just literally just missed--
you know, fled for his life,

01:00:13.289 --> 01:00:14.330
just missed being killed.

01:00:14.330 --> 01:00:16.160
A friend of his was
murdered who was gay.

01:00:16.160 --> 01:00:20.540
And managed to get out all
the way through Latin America,

01:00:20.540 --> 01:00:22.360
declared asylum at
the Mexican border,

01:00:22.360 --> 01:00:24.230
was placed in detention
for seven months,

01:00:24.230 --> 01:00:26.900
and ended up being released to
a family friend in the Bronx.

01:00:26.900 --> 01:00:31.730
But his asylum case, the hearing
is set for November 2019.

01:00:31.730 --> 01:00:33.440
This was like a year ago, right?

01:00:33.440 --> 01:00:36.650
So in the meantime, he was
just sort of here in limbo.

01:00:36.650 --> 01:00:39.080
We helped him get Special
Immigrant Juvenile Status, too,

01:00:39.080 --> 01:00:41.390
because that's actually
something he was eligible for,

01:00:41.390 --> 01:00:41.890
right?

01:00:41.890 --> 01:00:44.330
So just in general,
it's just a mess.

01:00:44.330 --> 01:00:45.634
A long time to wait.

01:00:45.634 --> 01:00:47.300
And I think now,
particularly for people

01:00:47.300 --> 01:00:49.300
who are in the
administrative process--

01:00:49.300 --> 01:00:51.860
so they aren't in deportation
proceedings but they are

01:00:51.860 --> 01:00:54.980
actually going to be going in
front of asylum officers who

01:00:54.980 --> 01:00:58.100
have an unbelievable amount of
discretion in terms of whether

01:00:58.100 --> 01:01:00.650
they grant asylum or don't--

01:01:00.650 --> 01:01:02.480
that's one area
that really worries

01:01:02.480 --> 01:01:06.230
me of what the direction
that's going to flow down

01:01:06.230 --> 01:01:09.650
through the federal agency is
going to be about screening out

01:01:09.650 --> 01:01:13.460
more and more people, which
is already just a really

01:01:13.460 --> 01:01:14.690
subjective process.

01:01:14.690 --> 01:01:17.390
But we know that we're having
this sort of word on high,

01:01:17.390 --> 01:01:21.380
like, find more people, do
more raids, deport more people,

01:01:21.380 --> 01:01:23.780
limit the number of
children that are coming in,

01:01:23.780 --> 01:01:25.980
all of these things
that cut out people.

01:01:25.980 --> 01:01:27.590
So I'm really
concerned that that's

01:01:27.590 --> 01:01:30.740
going to play in there in
that administrative process.

01:01:30.740 --> 01:01:33.890
In the court system, at least
you've got kind of levels,

01:01:33.890 --> 01:01:36.260
right, of a judicial
officer and other folks

01:01:36.260 --> 01:01:37.690
that are overseeing some cases.

01:01:37.690 --> 01:01:40.190
So, in theory, anyway, there
should be some more protections

01:01:40.190 --> 01:01:41.202
there.

01:01:41.202 --> 01:01:43.410
ALEX: You know, we're talking
about things we can do.

01:01:43.410 --> 01:01:45.890
And there are these sort of
organizational institutional

01:01:45.890 --> 01:01:48.200
things we could do, like
supporting organizations

01:01:48.200 --> 01:01:49.220
like Lambda.

01:01:49.220 --> 01:01:50.810
On a kind of more
daily basis, I know

01:01:50.810 --> 01:01:53.084
one issue I've seen kind
of on our listservs here

01:01:53.084 --> 01:01:54.500
that comes up,
every now and then,

01:01:54.500 --> 01:01:57.410
we'll see a parent of a
trans youth come on and say,

01:01:57.410 --> 01:02:00.635
you know, I need some advice on
how to handle this situation,

01:02:00.635 --> 01:02:02.060
and what advice
would you give me?

01:02:02.060 --> 01:02:05.542
So I guess I'm curious for you
guys, as you were growing up,

01:02:05.542 --> 01:02:08.000
you know, what were things that
were really helpful for you

01:02:08.000 --> 01:02:09.904
that people did or said?

01:02:09.904 --> 01:02:12.320
What were things that were
kind of negative for you that--

01:02:12.320 --> 01:02:15.260
basically, how can we
as people be better

01:02:15.260 --> 01:02:19.040
to support trans youth
as they're growing up?

01:02:19.040 --> 01:02:22.051
SAVANNAH: I'm trying to
think how I want to say this.

01:02:22.051 --> 01:02:24.300
Actually, Lydia, do you have
anything you want to say?

01:02:24.300 --> 01:02:25.008
You can go first.

01:02:31.580 --> 01:02:33.050
If not, I can.

01:02:33.050 --> 01:02:33.620
LYDIA: Yeah.

01:02:33.620 --> 01:02:36.200
I got a little something.

01:02:36.200 --> 01:02:37.180
I'll try.

01:02:40.120 --> 01:02:40.640
OK.

01:02:40.640 --> 01:02:48.322
So as I was growing up,
really, on both the sides

01:02:48.322 --> 01:02:54.805
of my family, my dad's side and
my mom's side, I'm the only--

01:02:57.760 --> 01:03:11.870
literally the only, that we know
of, the only openly homosexual.

01:03:11.870 --> 01:03:13.505
I'm the only--

01:03:13.505 --> 01:03:17.960
I'm the LGBT and
the Q of the family.

01:03:17.960 --> 01:03:19.340
Just that one.

01:03:22.870 --> 01:03:34.910
But while I was growing up, I
never really actually came out.

01:03:39.650 --> 01:03:40.790
It just happened.

01:03:40.790 --> 01:03:44.640
And they found out, so I--

01:03:44.640 --> 01:03:47.435
I guess my mom and
my sister had just--

01:03:47.435 --> 01:03:49.610
well, my sister, she
then knew, I guess.

01:03:49.610 --> 01:03:51.860
She just knew this whole time.

01:03:51.860 --> 01:03:54.802
Didn't inform me that she knew.

01:03:54.802 --> 01:04:00.470
My mom, it was kind of a
different thing with her.

01:04:00.470 --> 01:04:06.670
It was like, I guess,
she found out someway.

01:04:06.670 --> 01:04:11.280
I'm not sure how,
but she found out.

01:04:11.280 --> 01:04:14.225
It took them a while to
really be OK with it.

01:04:14.225 --> 01:04:17.840
But then they were like, oh, OK.

01:04:17.840 --> 01:04:19.225
All right.

01:04:19.225 --> 01:04:19.725
Sure.

01:04:22.340 --> 01:04:28.840
But my best advice for
that is if you see signs--

01:04:28.840 --> 01:04:32.600
like, I don't really know
what the signs could be,

01:04:32.600 --> 01:04:38.570
but if you see signs of
anything, just, like,

01:04:38.570 --> 01:04:40.280
don't ask them about it.

01:04:40.280 --> 01:04:47.420
Just see, I guess, like, try
to talk to them about anything

01:04:47.420 --> 01:04:49.910
in general, like
[INAUDIBLE] that you're not

01:04:49.910 --> 01:04:52.935
sure of from your
child, or whatever.

01:04:56.919 --> 01:04:58.190
Just talk to them about it.

01:04:58.190 --> 01:05:01.790
Because I'm pretty sure
sometimes they want to tell you

01:05:01.790 --> 01:05:04.390
but they're not sure
how you would take it.

01:05:04.390 --> 01:05:07.670
Have an open mind.

01:05:07.670 --> 01:05:09.630
A clear mindset.

01:05:09.630 --> 01:05:12.080
And enter it without hostility.

01:05:12.080 --> 01:05:17.430
Just go in with--

01:05:17.430 --> 01:05:21.640
just go into the
conversation without--

01:05:27.130 --> 01:05:28.090
what's the word for it?

01:05:28.090 --> 01:05:30.340
I guess without violence.

01:05:33.137 --> 01:05:34.720
And don't try to
force it out of them.

01:05:34.720 --> 01:05:36.560
Don't try to force
it out of them.

01:05:36.560 --> 01:05:39.060
Because if they're already--
they're more than likely having

01:05:39.060 --> 01:05:42.380
a hard time telling you, just--

01:05:42.380 --> 01:05:45.270
when they feel it's time
for them to tell you,

01:05:45.270 --> 01:05:48.070
just let them tell you.

01:05:48.070 --> 01:05:53.449
Don't be harsh about it.

01:05:53.449 --> 01:05:55.240
Of course, you know,
if they don't like it,

01:05:55.240 --> 01:05:56.130
they won't like it.

01:05:56.130 --> 01:05:59.170
But still be supporting--

01:06:01.910 --> 01:06:04.980
just be there for them in
any way, shape or form.

01:06:04.980 --> 01:06:06.960
Because it will make--

01:06:06.960 --> 01:06:13.050
trust me, it will make that
young boy or young girl,

01:06:13.050 --> 01:06:17.184
whichever one, it will make
them feel a whole lot better.

01:06:17.184 --> 01:06:18.100
CURREY COOK: I think--

01:06:18.100 --> 01:06:20.850
I just wanted to say one
thing that I think we really

01:06:20.850 --> 01:06:25.722
need to make sure and not
forget is that many of you

01:06:25.722 --> 01:06:27.180
may have been
following in the news

01:06:27.180 --> 01:06:29.940
recently this
epidemic particularly

01:06:29.940 --> 01:06:33.630
against trans women of
color just being killed

01:06:33.630 --> 01:06:35.220
at alarming rates, right?

01:06:35.220 --> 01:06:37.320
Two trans women were just
killed in New Orleans

01:06:37.320 --> 01:06:39.580
just in the course of
the last week or two.

01:06:39.580 --> 01:06:40.080
Right?

01:06:40.080 --> 01:06:42.420
And so all of this that
we're talking about, right,

01:06:42.420 --> 01:06:46.110
the assault on trans
people, on LGBT people,

01:06:46.110 --> 01:06:47.940
in general by this
administration,

01:06:47.940 --> 01:06:51.600
by state legislatures like
Texas and other places,

01:06:51.600 --> 01:06:53.520
lack of protections
in the law, it's

01:06:53.520 --> 01:06:56.340
all part and parcel of
the same thing, right?

01:06:56.340 --> 01:06:59.471
Giving a message that
these people are other.

01:06:59.471 --> 01:06:59.970
Right?

01:06:59.970 --> 01:07:02.220
And that absolutely
contributes to violence

01:07:02.220 --> 01:07:03.580
against that population.

01:07:03.580 --> 01:07:06.980
So thinking about Casey and--

01:07:06.980 --> 01:07:10.050
I'm sorry, Savannah
and Lydia and Soul

01:07:10.050 --> 01:07:14.550
navigating the world, right, and
having these negative messages

01:07:14.550 --> 01:07:17.710
also contributes to suicidal
ideation, depression,

01:07:17.710 --> 01:07:18.210
and stuff.

01:07:18.210 --> 01:07:21.000
So sometimes we can
distance through the law

01:07:21.000 --> 01:07:22.590
and the government
and these actions

01:07:22.590 --> 01:07:24.330
from what's really
happening to people

01:07:24.330 --> 01:07:25.740
and the violence
they experience.

01:07:25.740 --> 01:07:27.510
But it's actually all the same.

01:07:27.510 --> 01:07:30.179
So as we go forward and
advocating and fighting

01:07:30.179 --> 01:07:32.220
against this, I think it's
important to keep that

01:07:32.220 --> 01:07:34.350
at the front of our minds.

01:07:34.350 --> 01:07:36.340
And I want to just
say a huge thank you

01:07:36.340 --> 01:07:41.350
to Lydia and Savannah and
Soul for sharing all of this.

01:07:41.350 --> 01:07:41.850
ALEX: Yeah.

01:07:41.850 --> 01:07:43.840
Thank you guys all
so much for sharing.

01:07:43.840 --> 01:07:44.990
Really appreciate it.

01:07:44.990 --> 01:07:48.340
[APPLAUSE]
