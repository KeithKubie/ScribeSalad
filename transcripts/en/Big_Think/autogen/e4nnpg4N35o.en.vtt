well there is a theory David about what

00:00:06.179 --> 00:00:06.189
well there is a theory David about what
 

00:00:06.189 --> 00:00:08.820
well there is a theory David about what
dark matter is you talk about different

00:00:08.820 --> 00:00:08.830
dark matter is you talk about different
 

00:00:08.830 --> 00:00:11.249
dark matter is you talk about different
universes let's say that our universe is

00:00:11.249 --> 00:00:11.259
universes let's say that our universe is
 

00:00:11.259 --> 00:00:14.789
universes let's say that our universe is
a sheet of paper we live our entire life

00:00:14.789 --> 00:00:14.799
a sheet of paper we live our entire life
 

00:00:14.799 --> 00:00:16.740
a sheet of paper we live our entire life
on this sheet of paper but directly

00:00:16.740 --> 00:00:16.750
on this sheet of paper but directly
 

00:00:16.750 --> 00:00:17.430
on this sheet of paper but directly
above us

00:00:17.430 --> 00:00:17.440
above us
 

00:00:17.440 --> 00:00:19.730
above us
there could be a parallel universe

00:00:19.730 --> 00:00:19.740
there could be a parallel universe
 

00:00:19.740 --> 00:00:21.750
there could be a parallel universe
hovering right over us

00:00:21.750 --> 00:00:21.760
hovering right over us
 

00:00:21.760 --> 00:00:24.980
hovering right over us
perhaps inches centimeters away and

00:00:24.980 --> 00:00:24.990
perhaps inches centimeters away and
 

00:00:24.990 --> 00:00:27.600
perhaps inches centimeters away and
objects in this parallel universe would

00:00:27.600 --> 00:00:27.610
objects in this parallel universe would
 

00:00:27.610 --> 00:00:30.390
objects in this parallel universe would
be invisible light travels beneath the

00:00:30.390 --> 00:00:30.400
be invisible light travels beneath the
 

00:00:30.400 --> 00:00:33.090
be invisible light travels beneath the
universe so we never see this other

00:00:33.090 --> 00:00:33.100
universe so we never see this other
 

00:00:33.100 --> 00:00:36.689
universe so we never see this other
galaxy but gravity gravity goes between

00:00:36.689 --> 00:00:36.699
galaxy but gravity gravity goes between
 

00:00:36.699 --> 00:00:38.669
galaxy but gravity gravity goes between
universes because gravity is nothing but

00:00:38.669 --> 00:00:38.679
universes because gravity is nothing but
 

00:00:38.679 --> 00:00:41.189
universes because gravity is nothing but
the bending of space so if the space

00:00:41.189 --> 00:00:41.199
the bending of space so if the space
 

00:00:41.199 --> 00:00:43.169
the bending of space so if the space
between two sheets of paper is bent

00:00:43.169 --> 00:00:43.179
between two sheets of paper is bent
 

00:00:43.179 --> 00:00:45.989
between two sheets of paper is bent
slightly gravity then moves across so

00:00:45.989 --> 00:00:45.999
slightly gravity then moves across so
 

00:00:45.999 --> 00:00:48.599
slightly gravity then moves across so
think about it this other galaxy in

00:00:48.599 --> 00:00:48.609
think about it this other galaxy in
 

00:00:48.609 --> 00:00:51.479
think about it this other galaxy in
another universe would be invisible yet

00:00:51.479 --> 00:00:51.489
another universe would be invisible yet
 

00:00:51.489 --> 00:00:54.779
another universe would be invisible yet
it would have mass that's exactly what

00:00:54.779 --> 00:00:54.789
it would have mass that's exactly what
 

00:00:54.789 --> 00:00:58.559
it would have mass that's exactly what
dark matter is dark matter is massive it

00:00:58.559 --> 00:00:58.569
dark matter is dark matter is massive it
 

00:00:58.569 --> 00:01:01.860
dark matter is dark matter is massive it
has gravity but it's invisible it has no

00:01:01.860 --> 00:01:01.870
has gravity but it's invisible it has no
 

00:01:01.870 --> 00:01:03.599
has gravity but it's invisible it has no
interactions with light or the

00:01:03.599 --> 00:01:03.609
interactions with light or the
 

00:01:03.609 --> 00:01:06.120
interactions with light or the
electromagnetic force so there is a

00:01:06.120 --> 00:01:06.130
electromagnetic force so there is a
 

00:01:06.130 --> 00:01:08.550
electromagnetic force so there is a
theory that says that perhaps dark

00:01:08.550 --> 00:01:08.560
theory that says that perhaps dark
 

00:01:08.560 --> 00:01:11.609
theory that says that perhaps dark
matter is nothing but matter ordinary

00:01:11.609 --> 00:01:11.619
matter is nothing but matter ordinary
 

00:01:11.619 --> 00:01:14.280
matter is nothing but matter ordinary
matter in another dimension hovering

00:01:14.280 --> 00:01:14.290
matter in another dimension hovering
 

00:01:14.290 --> 00:01:16.679
matter in another dimension hovering
right above us we should also point out

00:01:16.679 --> 00:01:16.689
right above us we should also point out
 

00:01:16.689 --> 00:01:18.090
right above us we should also point out
however that there are other theories

00:01:18.090 --> 00:01:18.100
however that there are other theories
 

00:01:18.100 --> 00:01:20.399
however that there are other theories
too dark matter is the cutting edge of

00:01:20.399 --> 00:01:20.409
too dark matter is the cutting edge of
 

00:01:20.409 --> 00:01:22.350
too dark matter is the cutting edge of
science some people think that maybe

00:01:22.350 --> 00:01:22.360
science some people think that maybe
 

00:01:22.360 --> 00:01:24.029
science some people think that maybe
it's a higher vibration of the string

00:01:24.029 --> 00:01:24.039
it's a higher vibration of the string
 

00:01:24.039 --> 00:01:26.910
it's a higher vibration of the string
all the atoms of our body represent the

00:01:26.910 --> 00:01:26.920
all the atoms of our body represent the
 

00:01:26.920 --> 00:01:29.130
all the atoms of our body represent the
lowest octave of a tiny rubber band

00:01:29.130 --> 00:01:29.140
lowest octave of a tiny rubber band
 

00:01:29.140 --> 00:01:32.190
lowest octave of a tiny rubber band
vibrating all over our body and the

00:01:32.190 --> 00:01:32.200
vibrating all over our body and the
 

00:01:32.200 --> 00:01:33.779
vibrating all over our body and the
rubber band can have a higher octave

00:01:33.779 --> 00:01:33.789
rubber band can have a higher octave
 

00:01:33.789 --> 00:01:37.170
rubber band can have a higher octave
that next octave could be dark matter so

00:01:37.170 --> 00:01:37.180
that next octave could be dark matter so
 

00:01:37.180 --> 00:01:39.539
that next octave could be dark matter so
that's yet another explanation for what

00:01:39.539 --> 00:01:39.549
that's yet another explanation for what
 

00:01:39.549 --> 00:01:42.240
that's yet another explanation for what
dark matter might be so the bottom line

00:01:42.240 --> 00:01:42.250
dark matter might be so the bottom line
 

00:01:42.250 --> 00:01:44.760
dark matter might be so the bottom line
