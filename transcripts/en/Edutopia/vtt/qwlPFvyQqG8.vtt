00:00:10.046 --> 00:00:12.866
&gt;&gt;Sarah: Basically what I want you
to know is what people say to us

00:00:12.986 --> 00:00:15.976
and how other people treat us kind of
shapes what we think about ourselves.

00:00:16.586 --> 00:00:18.416
And I want to share with you a story.

00:00:18.766 --> 00:00:20.276
One day Maria woke up...

00:00:20.406 --> 00:00:23.426
&gt;&gt;Narrator: Sarah Button is about
to tear her heart out in front

00:00:23.426 --> 00:00:26.436
of fifth graders at the
Patrick Daly School in Brooklyn.

00:00:26.436 --> 00:00:29.306
&gt;&gt;Sarah: And her sister came into
the room and said "You're going

00:00:29.306 --> 00:00:30.916
to wear those old rags to school?"

00:00:31.416 --> 00:00:33.956
[ripping paper heart]

00:00:34.456 --> 00:00:38.066
&gt;&gt;Narrator: Her lesson is part of
the curriculum developed by R.C.C.P.,

00:00:38.206 --> 00:00:41.716
the Resolving Conflict Creatively
Program and it's designed

00:00:41.716 --> 00:00:44.706
to help kids identify and
control their emotions.

00:00:44.916 --> 00:00:46.196
&gt;&gt;Linda: The work that we do

00:00:46.346 --> 00:00:48.916
in the Resolving Conflict
Creatively Program is

00:00:48.916 --> 00:00:51.946
about equipping young people
with the kids of skills they need

00:00:51.946 --> 00:00:55.206
to both identify and
manage their emotions,

00:00:56.316 --> 00:00:58.736
to communicate those
emotions effectively,

00:00:59.276 --> 00:01:01.706
and to resolve conflict nonviolently.

00:01:01.706 --> 00:01:06.556
So it's a whole set of skills
and competencies that for us fall

00:01:06.556 --> 00:01:10.016
under the umbrella of
emotional intelligence.

00:01:10.126 --> 00:01:11.256
&gt;&gt;Sarah: And started complaining

00:01:11.446 --> 00:01:13.826
that Maria always takes
the last bowl of cereal.

00:01:14.436 --> 00:01:16.556
"You never leave any for me."

00:01:17.056 --> 00:01:19.426
[ripping paper heart]

00:01:19.926 --> 00:01:23.556
&gt;&gt;Linda: We are talking about a whole
new vision of education that says

00:01:23.556 --> 00:01:27.146
that educating the heart is as
important as educating the mind.

00:01:27.766 --> 00:01:29.456
&gt;&gt;Sarah: So that was Maria's day.

00:01:29.976 --> 00:01:33.296
How do you think Maria is feeling now
if this is what's left of her heart?

00:01:33.776 --> 00:01:36.266
&gt;&gt;Has anybody ever had
a day like Maria had?

00:01:36.266 --> 00:01:39.916
&gt;&gt;Student: When I went to my uncle's
house, they looked at my clothes

00:01:40.006 --> 00:01:41.156
and they started laughing.

00:01:41.816 --> 00:01:43.136
&gt;&gt;Sarah: Okay how did
that make you feel?

00:01:43.596 --> 00:01:43.866
&gt;&gt;Student: Sad.

00:01:44.786 --> 00:01:48.636
&gt;&gt;Sarah: Now I want you to think what
kind of effect do you think this has

00:01:48.636 --> 00:01:52.396
on Maria if day in and day out
this is what happens to her?

00:01:52.396 --> 00:01:53.726
This is the way she's being treated.

00:01:53.726 --> 00:01:56.816
What kind of effect
does that have on her?

00:01:57.136 --> 00:02:02.196
&gt;&gt;Student: She ain't gonna
have no self-respect.

00:02:02.196 --> 00:02:03.586
&gt;&gt;Linda: We're really
not teaching values.

00:02:03.956 --> 00:02:05.326
We're actually teaching skills.

00:02:05.836 --> 00:02:08.426
We're teaching some
solid competencies

00:02:08.426 --> 00:02:10.846
that people can learn and use.

00:02:10.846 --> 00:02:13.386
They're almost like
tools in a toolbox.

00:02:13.746 --> 00:02:16.676
&gt;&gt;Class: One, two, three, action.

00:02:23.976 --> 00:02:25.196
&gt;&gt;Sarah: And freeze.

00:02:25.596 --> 00:02:26.826
Nice job. Hector?

00:02:27.296 --> 00:02:27.506
&gt;&gt;Hector: Sad?

00:02:28.156 --> 00:02:28.686
&gt;&gt;Sarah: Alright.

00:02:28.686 --> 00:02:31.086
&gt;&gt;Narrator: The R.C.C.
program at this school grew

00:02:31.086 --> 00:02:34.296
out of a tragic incident in 1992.

00:02:34.296 --> 00:02:37.456
A young student had left the
school after an emotional outburst

00:02:37.456 --> 00:02:40.096
and when Principal
Patrick Daly followed him

00:02:40.096 --> 00:02:42.276
into a neighborhood housing
project, Daly was caught

00:02:42.276 --> 00:02:45.176
in the crossfire of
a drug deal gunfight.

00:02:45.176 --> 00:02:48.816
&gt;&gt;Sarah: Once we're able to
identify the feelings we're having,

00:02:49.256 --> 00:02:54.186
we're going to use it as a tool and
a strategy to help us solve problems.

00:02:54.986 --> 00:02:57.656
&gt;&gt;Class: One, two, three, action.

00:02:57.896 --> 00:02:59.606
&gt;&gt;Student: Stacy, you're
a lousy friend.

00:02:59.606 --> 00:03:01.386
You didn't even invite me
to your birthday party.

00:03:01.456 --> 00:03:03.476
I have you over to
my house all the time

00:03:03.796 --> 00:03:06.106
and you couldn't invite
me to one stupid party?

00:03:06.106 --> 00:03:08.446
&gt;&gt;Student: Dina, why
don't you shut up?

00:03:08.926 --> 00:03:10.176
Who cares what you think?

00:03:10.556 --> 00:03:13.406
It was a wonderful party
but you wouldn't have known

00:03:13.406 --> 00:03:15.996
because you'd never know how to act.

00:03:15.996 --> 00:03:18.816
If I invited you, you would
have ruined the whole thing.

00:03:19.656 --> 00:03:20.566
&gt;&gt;Teacher: And freeze.

00:03:21.336 --> 00:03:25.536
Okay, that's skit A. They're
now going to show you skit B

00:03:26.116 --> 00:03:28.506
and this is using the
strategy that I'm going

00:03:28.506 --> 00:03:30.866
to teach you in just a minute.

00:03:30.866 --> 00:03:33.846
&gt;&gt;Narrator: One way the R.C.C.
Program helps diffuse classroom

00:03:33.846 --> 00:03:37.166
conflicts is by teaching children
how to express their emotion

00:03:37.166 --> 00:03:39.906
in nonthreatening statements
called "I messages".

00:03:40.076 --> 00:03:43.496
&gt;&gt;Class: Okay, one,
two, three, action.

00:03:43.846 --> 00:03:46.026
&gt;&gt;Student: Stacy, I felt
hurt and angry when I found

00:03:46.026 --> 00:03:48.156
out you had a birthday party
and you didn't invite me

00:03:48.156 --> 00:03:51.006
because I thought we were good
friends and it just doesn't seem

00:03:51.106 --> 00:03:52.886
to me something a good
friend would do.

00:03:53.756 --> 00:03:56.356
&gt;&gt;Student: Dina, I wanted to
invite you to my birthday party,

00:03:56.806 --> 00:03:58.946
but my mother said I could
only invite two friends

00:03:58.946 --> 00:04:00.556
because all my cousins were coming.

00:04:00.656 --> 00:04:04.226
I wanted to talk to you before the
party but I didn't know how to.

00:04:04.646 --> 00:04:06.376
I would like to keep
on being friends.

00:04:08.016 --> 00:04:09.016
&gt;&gt;Sarah: And freeze.

00:04:09.326 --> 00:04:10.906
Alright, yeah, nice job.

00:04:10.956 --> 00:04:12.956
&gt;&gt;Class: [applause]

00:04:13.006 --> 00:04:14.536
&gt;&gt;Sarah: Well what we were
doing today is definitely,

00:04:14.536 --> 00:04:16.246
it's an artificial situation.

00:04:16.246 --> 00:04:22.346
It's not real life and granted,
when my kids go and they're

00:04:22.346 --> 00:04:25.696
into a situation where someone
has said "You talk about my mother

00:04:25.696 --> 00:04:28.116
and I'm not going to have
it, forget about it."

00:04:28.116 --> 00:04:30.406
You know they're going to slip
and they're going to go back

00:04:30.606 --> 00:04:31.926
"Well you said this,"
and they're going

00:04:31.926 --> 00:04:34.326
to get their attitudes
and that's kids.

00:04:34.826 --> 00:04:37.856
But what you try to do is
you try to bring them back.

00:04:37.856 --> 00:04:38.816
You try to review.

00:04:38.816 --> 00:04:39.856
You go over it again.

00:04:39.856 --> 00:04:42.306
You say "What's another way that
we could solve this problem?"

00:04:42.426 --> 00:04:44.266
&gt;&gt;When you don't play
with me because-

00:04:44.266 --> 00:04:47.036
&gt;&gt;Class: I thought
we were good friends.

00:04:47.036 --> 00:04:49.846
&gt;&gt;Sarah: I want to say
just one last thing.

00:04:50.416 --> 00:04:53.766
The true test is what happens
when you're in the situation

00:04:53.766 --> 00:04:57.206
and that's why we practice it so
that hopefully the next time you're

00:04:57.206 --> 00:05:00.606
in a situation where you're
finding yourself getting very upset,

00:05:00.906 --> 00:05:04.076
maybe you can stop, identify
what feeing you're having,

00:05:04.306 --> 00:05:07.406
why you're having it,
and maybe that will help

00:05:07.626 --> 00:05:09.406
to not cause more of a problem.

00:05:10.156 --> 00:05:13.666
&gt;&gt;And you start with as we've done
in here is building your community.

00:05:14.106 --> 00:05:16.796
And you build on that every month.

00:05:16.796 --> 00:05:19.776
And you keep going and going.

00:05:19.776 --> 00:05:20.836
&gt;&gt;I'll begin.

00:05:21.056 --> 00:05:23.386
And I'm very thankful
for my wonderful class.

00:05:23.386 --> 00:05:25.036
And I'm going to pass
on to [inaudible].

00:05:25.356 --> 00:05:27.876
&gt;&gt;Student: I'm thankful for a family

00:05:27.946 --> 00:05:31.986
because without a family
I wouldn't be here today.

00:05:31.986 --> 00:05:35.186
&gt;&gt;Sarah: By the end
of the year you have

00:05:35.186 --> 00:05:39.886
such a tight-knit focused
caring group it's amazing.

00:05:40.106 --> 00:05:42.106
I mean they might not carry
that on to the next year,

00:05:42.326 --> 00:05:45.256
but you know at least for that year,

00:05:45.256 --> 00:05:47.976
you've really made a
difference in those kids' lives.

00:05:48.066 --> 00:05:49.556
