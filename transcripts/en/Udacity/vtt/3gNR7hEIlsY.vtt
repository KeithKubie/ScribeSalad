00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.000
So this is a good start for a basic design for a pseudo-random number generator.

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:07.000
We have some pool of randomness, we extract a seed from that pool, 

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:11.000
we use that seed as the key to our encryption algorithm,

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:14.000
and as the messages, we use a counter. 

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:20.000
So suppose we use AES 128--so that means the key size and the block size 

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:28.000
are 128 bits, and so each time we do this, we get 128 bits out.

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:31.000
which we use as our random values.

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:40.000
And this counter will go up to (2^128) - 1, and then go back to 0.

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:48.000
So now I have a quiz about how well this works.

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:51.000
So the question is: does this produce a sequence that appears random?

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:57.000
And let's say... for the first 2^70 outputs--so certainly if we have more than--

00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:03.000
2^128 outputs, well, these countervalues repeat. So that would be non-random.

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:08.000
The choices are: "Yes," "No," because it repeats values too frequently, 

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:11.000
or "No," because it repeats values too infrequently.
