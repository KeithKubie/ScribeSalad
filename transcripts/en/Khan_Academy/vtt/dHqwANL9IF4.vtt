00:00:00.480 --> 00:00:03.107
Voiceover:We have two
pieces of information here.

00:00:03.107 --> 00:00:05.334
We're told that 11 is equal to eight plus

00:00:05.334 --> 00:00:07.961
f inverse of x minus three

00:00:07.961 --> 00:00:10.303
and that f of three is equal to 10.

00:00:10.303 --> 00:00:13.794
What I would like you to
try is pause the video

00:00:13.794 --> 00:00:17.257
and figure out the value of x.

00:00:19.779 --> 00:00:22.035
It looks a little daunting at first,

00:00:22.035 --> 00:00:24.886
you're like wow f
inverse of x minus three.

00:00:24.886 --> 00:00:26.648
Whenever you see something like this

00:00:26.648 --> 00:00:28.951
at least my impulse is at
least just try to simplify

00:00:28.951 --> 00:00:29.987
the information you have

00:00:29.987 --> 00:00:31.865
and then see if we can make sense of it.

00:00:31.865 --> 00:00:35.069
Here we could definitely
simplify this equation

00:00:35.069 --> 00:00:37.220
by subtracting eight from both sides.

00:00:37.220 --> 00:00:40.583
Just so that we have f
inverse by itself on one side.

00:00:40.583 --> 00:00:42.978
If we subtract eight from both sides,

00:00:42.978 --> 00:00:45.297
the left hand side 11 minus eight is three

00:00:45.297 --> 00:00:51.316
and the right hand side is
f inverse of x minus three.

00:00:51.316 --> 00:00:56.733
Or I could write this as
f inverse of x minus three

00:00:56.733 --> 00:00:59.443
is equal to three.

00:00:59.443 --> 00:01:02.636
These are essentially our
two pieces of information

00:01:02.636 --> 00:01:05.389
once we simplify this over here.

00:01:05.389 --> 00:01:07.361
This seems pretty interesting

00:01:07.361 --> 00:01:09.322
because we say f of three is 10

00:01:09.322 --> 00:01:13.640
and then we're saying f inverse

00:01:13.640 --> 00:01:17.719
of this right over here is equal to three.

00:01:17.719 --> 00:01:20.429
There seems to be something
interesting going on,

00:01:20.429 --> 00:01:22.391
we could even just think
about what a function

00:01:22.391 --> 00:01:23.768
and an inverse does.

00:01:23.768 --> 00:01:25.802
This is the domain of the function.

00:01:26.709 --> 00:01:27.772
Domain,

00:01:28.864 --> 00:01:32.778
and if this is the range,

00:01:32.778 --> 00:01:35.502
we know that the function maps

00:01:35.502 --> 00:01:40.661
from three in the domain
to 10 in the range.

00:01:40.661 --> 00:01:42.158
That's what the function does.

00:01:42.158 --> 00:01:45.018
If the function does that
then the inverse function

00:01:45.018 --> 00:01:47.215
would map from 10 in the range

00:01:47.215 --> 00:01:49.165
to three in the domain.

00:01:50.211 --> 00:01:53.047
This would be f inverse,

00:01:53.047 --> 00:01:55.808
so f inverse of 10 is equal to three.

00:01:55.808 --> 00:01:57.032
Let me write that down,

00:01:57.032 --> 00:02:00.189
f inverse of 10 is equal to three.

00:02:01.096 --> 00:02:03.477
What this thing right over here

00:02:03.477 --> 00:02:05.996
is the same thing as that
thing right over here.

00:02:05.996 --> 00:02:11.163
10 must be equal to x minus three.

00:02:11.163 --> 00:02:13.610
We could write x minus three

00:02:13.610 --> 00:02:15.725
is equal to 10,

00:02:15.725 --> 00:02:17.463
add three to both sides,

00:02:17.463 --> 00:02:21.952
x is equal to 13.
