00:00:00.430 --> 00:00:02.879
- Let's give ourselves a
little bit more practice

00:00:02.879 --> 00:00:05.933
adding and subtracting
positive and negative numbers.

00:00:05.933 --> 00:00:08.092
So, let's say that we have the statement,

00:00:08.092 --> 00:00:11.943
four is equal to negative eight

00:00:11.943 --> 00:00:13.828
minus blank.

00:00:13.828 --> 00:00:15.930
Like always, I encourage
you to pause the video

00:00:15.930 --> 00:00:18.309
and see if you can figure
out what blank would be

00:00:18.309 --> 00:00:19.551
to make the statement true.

00:00:19.551 --> 00:00:21.211
That negative eight minus blank

00:00:21.211 --> 00:00:23.011
is going to be equivalent to four.

00:00:23.011 --> 00:00:26.108
That four is equal to
negative eight minus blank.

00:00:26.749 --> 00:00:28.444
So now, let's work it through together.

00:00:28.444 --> 00:00:31.509
To help us I will get a number line.

00:00:31.509 --> 00:00:33.827
So there's a number line right over there.

00:00:34.561 --> 00:00:37.051
And, one way to think about it is,

00:00:37.051 --> 00:00:39.335
I wanna start at negative eight,

00:00:39.335 --> 00:00:41.542
so this is negative five, negative six,

00:00:41.542 --> 00:00:44.346
negative seven, negative eight.

00:00:44.346 --> 00:00:46.221
I wanna start at negative eight

00:00:46.221 --> 00:00:48.287
and I wanna do something to negative eight

00:00:48.287 --> 00:00:49.895
to end up at four.

00:00:50.512 --> 00:00:52.807
To end up at four.

00:00:52.807 --> 00:00:56.544
So four is positive one, two, three, four.

00:00:56.932 --> 00:00:58.646
So that's four right over there.

00:00:59.113 --> 00:01:02.167
So, what do I need to do
to get from negative eight

00:01:02.167 --> 00:01:03.870
to positive four?

00:01:04.371 --> 00:01:05.556
Well let's see.

00:01:05.556 --> 00:01:08.876
I have to move to the
right one, two, three,

00:01:08.876 --> 00:01:12.869
four, five, six, seven, eight,

00:01:12.869 --> 00:01:16.134
nine, 10, 11, 12.

00:01:16.134 --> 00:01:18.781
I have to the right 12 spaces.

00:01:18.781 --> 00:01:20.232
Or another way to think about it,

00:01:20.232 --> 00:01:22.218
to get from negative
eight to positive four

00:01:22.218 --> 00:01:23.790
I have to, I'm just gonna make sure

00:01:23.790 --> 00:01:25.427
I have some space up here,

00:01:25.427 --> 00:01:28.293
I have to add 12.

00:01:28.712 --> 00:01:29.814
Another way to think about it,

00:01:29.814 --> 00:01:31.394
to get from negative eight to zero,

00:01:31.394 --> 00:01:32.949
you have to add eight.

00:01:32.949 --> 00:01:34.853
Then to get from zero to four,

00:01:34.853 --> 00:01:36.374
you have to add another four.

00:01:36.374 --> 00:01:39.668
So you have to add eight plus four, or 12.

00:01:40.195 --> 00:01:41.196
But how do you do that?

00:01:41.196 --> 00:01:43.216
'Cause they're saying
negative eight minus something

00:01:43.216 --> 00:01:44.732
should be equal to four.

00:01:45.155 --> 00:01:47.373
Whatever you have over here,

00:01:47.373 --> 00:01:51.320
you want this to end up
the equivalent to plus 12,

00:01:51.320 --> 00:01:52.980
so what can you do there?

00:01:52.980 --> 00:01:54.860
Well you could subtract a negative.

00:01:54.860 --> 00:01:58.063
If you subtracted negative 12,

00:01:58.063 --> 00:02:01.083
this would be equivalent to adding 12.

00:02:01.083 --> 00:02:03.592
So notice, let me rewrite it,

00:02:03.592 --> 00:02:05.374
four is equal to,

00:02:05.374 --> 00:02:07.089
let me just write it
without my boxes there,

00:02:07.089 --> 00:02:11.181
is equal to negative
eight minus negative 12.

00:02:11.181 --> 00:02:13.978
Well what happens when
you subtract a negative?

00:02:13.978 --> 00:02:16.904
Well that ends up being
adding the positive.

00:02:16.904 --> 00:02:19.305
So this is gonna be the same thing as

00:02:19.305 --> 00:02:22.116
negative eight plus positive 12,

00:02:22.116 --> 00:02:26.145
or four is equal to negative 8 plus 12,

00:02:26.145 --> 00:02:27.379
which we know is true.

00:02:27.379 --> 00:02:29.258
You add eight you get to zero,

00:02:29.258 --> 00:02:31.023
negative eight plus eight is zero,

00:02:31.023 --> 00:02:34.542
then you add another four,
you get to positive four.

00:02:34.542 --> 00:02:36.933
So that one was pretty interesting.

00:02:36.933 --> 00:02:39.232
Let's do another one, we
can't get enough practice,

00:02:39.232 --> 00:02:40.614
this is too much fun.

00:02:40.614 --> 00:02:41.693
All right.

00:02:41.693 --> 00:02:43.434
So let's say we had...

00:02:43.434 --> 00:02:44.828
let's say we had

00:02:44.828 --> 00:02:47.468
something blank

00:02:47.468 --> 00:02:50.765
minus negative two

00:02:50.765 --> 00:02:53.864
is equal to negative seven.

00:02:54.352 --> 00:02:56.545
How do we think about this?

00:02:57.150 --> 00:02:58.787
Well the first thing my brain wants to do

00:02:58.787 --> 00:03:02.571
is to simplify subtracting a negative.

00:03:02.571 --> 00:03:04.105
So if you subtract negative two

00:03:04.105 --> 00:03:06.147
that's the same thing
as adding positive two.

00:03:06.147 --> 00:03:08.341
So this is an equivalent statement to say,

00:03:08.341 --> 00:03:11.104
something subtracting a negative two

00:03:11.104 --> 00:03:13.646
is the same thing as
adding a positive two.

00:03:13.646 --> 00:03:17.430
Something plus two is
equal to negative seven.

00:03:17.780 --> 00:03:20.843
And now we can get the number
line out to think about it.

00:03:21.541 --> 00:03:23.942
So, get my number line out.

00:03:24.559 --> 00:03:27.682
So, my goal, my goal is

00:03:27.682 --> 00:03:29.841
I wanna get to negative seven.

00:03:29.841 --> 00:03:31.867
So there's negative five, negative six,

00:03:32.375 --> 00:03:34.844
negative seven right there.

00:03:34.844 --> 00:03:37.642
And I wanna add two to something
to get to negative seven.

00:03:37.642 --> 00:03:40.521
So if I'm adding two that
means I'm jumping two,

00:03:40.521 --> 00:03:41.938
I'm jumping two to the right,

00:03:41.938 --> 00:03:43.760
that's what adding two looks like.

00:03:43.760 --> 00:03:45.966
So what number do I need to start at

00:03:45.966 --> 00:03:48.241
that if I jump two to
the right, if I add two

00:03:48.241 --> 00:03:50.061
I end up at negative seven?

00:03:50.061 --> 00:03:51.689
Well I would have to start two to the left

00:03:51.689 --> 00:03:53.334
of negative seven.

00:03:53.334 --> 00:03:56.511
If I start two to the left, one, two,

00:03:56.511 --> 00:03:57.792
if I started...

00:03:57.792 --> 00:03:59.394
Let me do this in a different color.

00:03:59.394 --> 00:04:01.692
If I start at this number right here

00:04:01.692 --> 00:04:04.999
and if I add two, plus one, plus two,

00:04:06.231 --> 00:04:08.019
I end up at negative seven.

00:04:08.019 --> 00:04:09.297
Well what number is this?

00:04:09.297 --> 00:04:13.116
This number that is two to
the left of negative seven.

00:04:13.116 --> 00:04:15.089
Well it's negative nine.

00:04:15.089 --> 00:04:17.598
So this right over here is negative nine.

00:04:17.598 --> 00:04:18.865
Negative nine plus two,

00:04:18.865 --> 00:04:20.885
so if you start at negative nine

00:04:20.885 --> 00:04:22.337
and you move two to the right

00:04:22.337 --> 00:04:24.051
you end up at negative seven.

00:04:24.051 --> 00:04:25.933
Or, you could say, negative nine

00:04:25.933 --> 00:04:29.531
minus negative two, 'cause
if you subtract negative two

00:04:29.531 --> 00:04:32.178
you're going to move to the right.

00:04:32.178 --> 00:04:34.894
If you subtract positive
two, you move to the left.

00:04:34.894 --> 00:04:36.171
But then if you subtract negative two,

00:04:36.171 --> 00:04:39.339
you move two to the
right, to negative seven.

00:04:39.793 --> 00:04:41.244
Another fascinating one.

00:04:41.244 --> 00:04:42.707
Let's do one more of these,

00:04:42.707 --> 00:04:44.866
I'm having maybe a
little bit too much fun.

00:04:44.866 --> 00:04:46.166
All right.

00:04:46.166 --> 00:04:50.218
So let's say we have negative four

00:04:50.218 --> 00:04:54.111
is equal to blank minus nine.

00:04:55.008 --> 00:04:56.388
So let's get the number line out

00:04:56.388 --> 00:04:58.327
and always pause the video, see if you can

00:04:58.327 --> 00:04:59.717
try it on your own.

00:05:00.474 --> 00:05:03.196
But let's get my number line out

00:05:03.917 --> 00:05:05.554
and so let's think about it.

00:05:05.554 --> 00:05:08.622
Our goal, we wanna take some number

00:05:08.622 --> 00:05:11.837
subtract nine from it
and get negative four.

00:05:11.837 --> 00:05:13.737
So we wanna get negative four

00:05:14.621 --> 00:05:15.840
and then there's some number

00:05:15.840 --> 00:05:17.500
that if we take nine away from it.

00:05:17.500 --> 00:05:19.682
So if you take nine away from something

00:05:19.682 --> 00:05:22.004
that's moving nine to the left.

00:05:22.004 --> 00:05:25.475
So, another way to think
about subtracting nine,

00:05:25.475 --> 00:05:27.569
let me do this in a different color,

00:05:27.569 --> 00:05:31.085
subtracting nine.

00:05:31.644 --> 00:05:33.594
That's literally moving nine to the left.

00:05:33.594 --> 00:05:35.405
One, two, three, four, five,

00:05:35.405 --> 00:05:38.087
six, seven, eight, nine.

00:05:38.087 --> 00:05:40.804
So there's some number that we start with,

00:05:40.804 --> 00:05:42.812
we're gonna subtract nine

00:05:42.812 --> 00:05:45.013
and then we end up with negative four.

00:05:45.013 --> 00:05:47.451
We're gonna end up with negative four.

00:05:47.451 --> 00:05:50.144
Some number, that's the
blank right over here,

00:05:50.144 --> 00:05:52.373
you subtract nine, you
move nine to the left,

00:05:52.373 --> 00:05:54.811
that's gonna be equal to negative four.

00:05:54.811 --> 00:05:56.455
So another way to think about it is,

00:05:56.455 --> 00:06:00.576
this number is gonna be nine
to the right of negative four.

00:06:00.576 --> 00:06:02.892
So let's think about what
that number's gonna be.

00:06:03.370 --> 00:06:04.844
So this number is gonna be nine

00:06:04.844 --> 00:06:07.131
to the right of negative four.

00:06:07.131 --> 00:06:09.882
One, two, three, four, five,

00:06:09.882 --> 00:06:12.902
six, seven, eight, nine.

00:06:12.902 --> 00:06:15.327
It looks like positive five.

00:06:15.327 --> 00:06:17.742
So let's see if we're right about that.

00:06:17.742 --> 00:06:20.400
If we start as positive
five and we subtract nine,

00:06:20.400 --> 00:06:24.080
so let's do that, one, two, three, four,

00:06:24.080 --> 00:06:28.401
five, six, seven, eight, nine.

00:06:28.401 --> 00:06:30.672
Yup, you subtract nine,

00:06:30.672 --> 00:06:33.629
you're gonna end up at negative four.

00:06:33.629 --> 00:06:37.748
So negative four is
equal to five minus nine.
