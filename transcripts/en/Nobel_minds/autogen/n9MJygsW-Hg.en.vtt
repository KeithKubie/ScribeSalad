really don't know the answer to that I'm

00:00:19.370 --> 00:00:19.380
really don't know the answer to that I'm
 

00:00:19.380 --> 00:00:22.340
really don't know the answer to that I'm
stepping backwards myself into trying to

00:00:22.340 --> 00:00:22.350
stepping backwards myself into trying to
 

00:00:22.350 --> 00:00:25.089
stepping backwards myself into trying to
understand carbon vapor a bit better and

00:00:25.089 --> 00:00:25.099
understand carbon vapor a bit better and

so I can't really advise you all i can

00:00:32.269 --> 00:00:32.279
so I can't really advise you all i can
 

00:00:32.279 --> 00:00:36.560
so I can't really advise you all i can
say is to tell you what my experience

00:00:36.560 --> 00:00:36.570
say is to tell you what my experience
 

00:00:36.570 --> 00:00:43.639
say is to tell you what my experience
was and enough general level but not to

00:00:43.639 --> 00:00:43.649
was and enough general level but not to
 

00:00:43.649 --> 00:00:46.299
was and enough general level but not to
actually advise you on a specifics and

00:00:46.299 --> 00:00:46.309
actually advise you on a specifics and
 

00:00:46.309 --> 00:00:50.299

when I was a school as I said earlier I

00:00:50.299 --> 00:00:50.309
when I was a school as I said earlier I
 

00:00:50.309 --> 00:00:53.330
when I was a school as I said earlier I
got the book fees and fiza organic

00:00:53.330 --> 00:00:53.340
got the book fees and fiza organic
 

00:00:53.340 --> 00:00:54.680

by my teacher Harry Heaney who later

00:00:57.529 --> 00:00:57.539
by my teacher Harry Heaney who later
 

00:00:57.539 --> 00:01:00.920
by my teacher Harry Heaney who later
became a professor of chemistry and I

00:01:00.920 --> 00:01:00.930
became a professor of chemistry and I
 

00:01:00.930 --> 00:01:02.840
became a professor of chemistry and I
read that book from carrots ago and I

00:01:02.840 --> 00:01:02.850
read that book from carrots ago and I
 

00:01:02.850 --> 00:01:05.539
read that book from carrots ago and I
really liked it was written it was it

00:01:05.539 --> 00:01:05.549
really liked it was written it was it
 

00:01:05.549 --> 00:01:07.280
really liked it was written it was it
was written as a bit of a read rather

00:01:07.280 --> 00:01:07.290
was written as a bit of a read rather
 

00:01:07.290 --> 00:01:09.649
was written as a bit of a read rather
than just organic chemistry as I if I

00:01:09.649 --> 00:01:09.659
than just organic chemistry as I if I
 

00:01:09.659 --> 00:01:12.710
than just organic chemistry as I if I
had any particular interest it was

00:01:12.710 --> 00:01:12.720
had any particular interest it was
 

00:01:12.720 --> 00:01:13.969
had any particular interest it was
organic chemistry when I went to

00:01:13.969 --> 00:01:13.979
organic chemistry when I went to
 

00:01:13.979 --> 00:01:22.340
organic chemistry when I went to
university and then I discovered our

00:01:22.340 --> 00:01:22.350
university and then I discovered our
 

00:01:22.350 --> 00:01:29.230
university and then I discovered our
lectures from Professor sheffield on

00:01:29.230 --> 00:01:29.240
lectures from Professor sheffield on
 

00:01:29.240 --> 00:01:35.050
lectures from Professor sheffield on
spectroscopy and from George Porter on

00:01:35.050 --> 00:01:35.060
spectroscopy and from George Porter on
 

00:01:35.060 --> 00:01:39.170
spectroscopy and from George Porter on
free free radical chemistry and flash

photolysis and I are pretty excited

00:01:41.719 --> 00:01:41.729
photolysis and I are pretty excited
 

00:01:41.729 --> 00:01:43.789
photolysis and I are pretty excited
about spectroscopy so I got diverted

00:01:43.789 --> 00:01:43.799
about spectroscopy so I got diverted
 

00:01:43.799 --> 00:01:46.819
about spectroscopy so I got diverted
into something which had a bit of

00:01:46.819 --> 00:01:46.829
into something which had a bit of
 

00:01:46.829 --> 00:01:48.530
into something which had a bit of
quantum mechanics and I was interested

00:01:48.530 --> 00:01:48.540
quantum mechanics and I was interested
 

00:01:48.540 --> 00:01:56.480
quantum mechanics and I was interested
in that too and I fell in love with that

00:01:56.480 --> 00:01:56.490
in that too and I fell in love with that
 

00:01:56.490 --> 00:02:01.429
in that too and I fell in love with that
subject a bit and then got the first

00:02:01.429 --> 00:02:01.439
subject a bit and then got the first
 

00:02:01.439 --> 00:02:04.999
subject a bit and then got the first
degree and pretty good one and I could

00:02:04.999 --> 00:02:05.009
degree and pretty good one and I could
 

00:02:05.009 --> 00:02:08.510
degree and pretty good one and I could
go on to do a PhD so I wanted to stay at

00:02:08.510 --> 00:02:08.520
go on to do a PhD so I wanted to stay at
 

00:02:08.520 --> 00:02:11.180
go on to do a PhD so I wanted to stay at
university to do the PhD but I wasn't

00:02:11.180 --> 00:02:11.190
university to do the PhD but I wasn't
 

00:02:11.190 --> 00:02:11.950
university to do the PhD but I wasn't
thinking of

00:02:11.950 --> 00:02:11.960
thinking of
 

00:02:11.960 --> 00:02:14.560
thinking of
from becoming a chemist a mate

00:02:14.560 --> 00:02:14.570
from becoming a chemist a mate
 

00:02:14.570 --> 00:02:16.660
from becoming a chemist a mate
particularly I I wanted to stay at

00:02:16.660 --> 00:02:16.670
particularly I I wanted to stay at
 

00:02:16.670 --> 00:02:22.930
particularly I I wanted to stay at
university because I had was I played

00:02:22.930 --> 00:02:22.940
university because I had was I played
 

00:02:22.940 --> 00:02:25.900
university because I had was I played
tennis for the University and I was on

00:02:25.900 --> 00:02:25.910
tennis for the University and I was on
 

00:02:25.910 --> 00:02:28.090
tennis for the University and I was on
the art editor for the magazine i was

00:02:28.090 --> 00:02:28.100
the art editor for the magazine i was
 

00:02:28.100 --> 00:02:29.410
the art editor for the magazine i was
doing lots of things and i didn't want

00:02:29.410 --> 00:02:29.420
doing lots of things and i didn't want
 

00:02:29.420 --> 00:02:31.240
doing lots of things and i didn't want
to stop I wanted to continue to do that

00:02:31.240 --> 00:02:31.250
to stop I wanted to continue to do that
 

00:02:31.250 --> 00:02:33.430
to stop I wanted to continue to do that
so I had three years as an undergraduate

00:02:33.430 --> 00:02:33.440
so I had three years as an undergraduate
 

00:02:33.440 --> 00:02:35.520
so I had three years as an undergraduate
in three years as a graduate student at

00:02:35.520 --> 00:02:35.530
in three years as a graduate student at
 

00:02:35.530 --> 00:02:38.560
in three years as a graduate student at
Sheffield and in fact became president

00:02:38.560 --> 00:02:38.570
Sheffield and in fact became president
 

00:02:38.570 --> 00:02:40.260
Sheffield and in fact became president
of athletics council so I had a bit of

00:02:40.260 --> 00:02:40.270
of athletics council so I had a bit of
 

00:02:40.270 --> 00:02:44.110
of athletics council so I had a bit of
student politics and friend of mine

student politics and friend of mine
 

00:02:44.120 --> 00:02:45.880
student politics and friend of mine
taught me to play the guitar not very

00:02:45.880 --> 00:02:45.890
taught me to play the guitar not very
 

00:02:45.890 --> 00:02:48.460
taught me to play the guitar not very
well he told me very well but I didn't

00:02:48.460 --> 00:02:48.470
well he told me very well but I didn't
 

00:02:48.470 --> 00:02:51.100
well he told me very well but I didn't
learn very well but they played a bit

00:02:51.100 --> 00:02:51.110
learn very well but they played a bit
 

00:02:51.110 --> 00:02:52.810

Margaret Sam and so it was I wanted to
 

00:02:59.900 --> 00:03:03.010
Margaret Sam and so it was I wanted to
stay there so I stayed to do a PhD and I

00:03:03.010 --> 00:03:03.020
stay there so I stayed to do a PhD and I
 

00:03:03.020 --> 00:03:05.290
stay there so I stayed to do a PhD and I
I like spectroscopy and with Richard

00:03:05.290 --> 00:03:05.300
I like spectroscopy and with Richard
 

00:03:05.300 --> 00:03:07.750
I like spectroscopy and with Richard
Dixon who was a spectra ask was i did a

00:03:07.750 --> 00:03:07.760
Dixon who was a spectra ask was i did a
 

00:03:07.760 --> 00:03:13.060
Dixon who was a spectra ask was i did a
PhD and then home high had offers

00:03:13.060 --> 00:03:13.070
PhD and then home high had offers
 

00:03:13.070 --> 00:03:18.100
PhD and then home high had offers
several offers of jobs and one was of

00:03:18.100 --> 00:03:18.110
several offers of jobs and one was of

I was already thinking of going abroad

00:03:29.170 --> 00:03:29.180
I was already thinking of going abroad
 

00:03:29.180 --> 00:03:30.850
I was already thinking of going abroad
to Canada to because I want to live

00:03:30.850 --> 00:03:30.860
to Canada to because I want to live
 

00:03:30.860 --> 00:03:33.730
to Canada to because I want to live
abroad to do a postdoc in spectroscopy

00:03:33.730 --> 00:03:33.740
abroad to do a postdoc in spectroscopy
 

00:03:33.740 --> 00:03:37.120
abroad to do a postdoc in spectroscopy
which I did and even then I coming back

00:03:37.120 --> 00:03:37.130
which I did and even then I coming back
 

00:03:37.130 --> 00:03:39.400
which I did and even then I coming back
and getting a job and then I was asked I

00:03:39.400 --> 00:03:39.410
and getting a job and then I was asked I
 

00:03:39.410 --> 00:03:42.210
and getting a job and then I was asked I
went to Bell Labs to do some more

00:03:42.210 --> 00:03:42.220
went to Bell Labs to do some more
 

00:03:42.220 --> 00:03:45.970
went to Bell Labs to do some more
research spectroscopic research and

00:03:45.970 --> 00:03:45.980
research spectroscopic research and
 

00:03:45.980 --> 00:03:48.100
research spectroscopic research and
theory and then came back to England to

00:03:48.100 --> 00:03:48.110
theory and then came back to England to
 

00:03:48.110 --> 00:03:50.350
theory and then came back to England to
a job a postdoc actually because I had

00:03:50.350 --> 00:03:50.360
a job a postdoc actually because I had
 

00:03:50.360 --> 00:03:52.840
a job a postdoc actually because I had
to get on to the guy back and then I was

00:03:52.840 --> 00:03:52.850
to get on to the guy back and then I was
 

00:03:52.850 --> 00:03:54.790
to get on to the guy back and then I was
offered a job in University and so it

00:03:54.790 --> 00:03:54.800
offered a job in University and so it
 

00:03:54.800 --> 00:03:58.630
offered a job in University and so it
was more than I just followed the things

00:03:58.630 --> 00:03:58.640
was more than I just followed the things
 

00:03:58.640 --> 00:04:01.300
was more than I just followed the things
that interested me at the particular

00:04:01.300 --> 00:04:01.310
that interested me at the particular
 

00:04:01.310 --> 00:04:04.390
that interested me at the particular
moment rather than some farsighted

00:04:04.390 --> 00:04:04.400
moment rather than some farsighted
 

00:04:04.400 --> 00:04:09.010
moment rather than some farsighted
aspect so my advice is whatever

00:04:09.010 --> 00:04:09.020
