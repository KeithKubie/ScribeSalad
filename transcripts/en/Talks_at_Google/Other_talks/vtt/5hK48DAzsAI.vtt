00:00:01.810 --> 00:00:03.660
-Well, thank you all
for coming today.

00:00:03.660 --> 00:00:05.890
We're so happy to have
Adrienne Celt here

00:00:05.890 --> 00:00:09.620
to read from her first
book, "The Daughters."

00:00:09.620 --> 00:00:12.920
And she's going to
kick it off by reading

00:00:12.920 --> 00:00:14.570
a portion of the
book and then we're

00:00:14.570 --> 00:00:16.785
going to go into a
question and answer.

00:00:16.785 --> 00:00:19.160
ADRIENNE CELT: I thought I
would just do a short reading.

00:00:19.160 --> 00:00:21.650
I'm really happy to be here
because I used to help run

00:00:21.650 --> 00:00:23.040
the "Authors at Google" team.

00:00:23.040 --> 00:00:25.510
Which we will talk a little
bit about later, I think.

00:00:25.510 --> 00:00:27.840
So I'm going to do a short
reading from the beginning.

00:00:27.840 --> 00:00:28.750
This is the prelude.

00:00:31.550 --> 00:00:33.560
"All my grandmother's
important stories

00:00:33.560 --> 00:00:35.860
took place in the
Polish countryside.

00:00:35.860 --> 00:00:37.850
Like this one.

00:00:37.850 --> 00:00:40.770
A woman sits nude on
the branch of a tree

00:00:40.770 --> 00:00:44.240
and lets her brown legs
dangle into the open air.

00:00:44.240 --> 00:00:47.040
The bark ridges cut
pleasantly into her thighs,

00:00:47.040 --> 00:00:49.520
and she presses her
palms down, curls

00:00:49.520 --> 00:00:52.030
her fingers around the bow.

00:00:52.030 --> 00:00:54.500
A man walks towards
her through the woods,

00:00:54.500 --> 00:00:56.790
pushing aside whip
thin limbs of birch

00:00:56.790 --> 00:00:59.390
and beech, side
stepping shrubs as he

00:00:59.390 --> 00:01:01.960
searches for his lost path.

00:01:01.960 --> 00:01:04.540
The woman hums a song
and the man's feet

00:01:04.540 --> 00:01:07.030
begin to fall in
time with the music.

00:01:07.030 --> 00:01:09.230
He does not realize
that this is happening,

00:01:09.230 --> 00:01:12.910
does not yet feel his
body enthralled to her.

00:01:12.910 --> 00:01:16.380
It is a surprise then when
he catches sight of her legs.

00:01:16.380 --> 00:01:19.780
He's far from his village,
tired and thirsty.

00:01:19.780 --> 00:01:21.840
The last thing he
expected to find here

00:01:21.840 --> 00:01:24.670
was another person,
particularly a woman

00:01:24.670 --> 00:01:28.110
who was naked and
glorious and alone.

00:01:28.110 --> 00:01:31.060
Her feet are callused,
the souls covered in dirt.

00:01:31.060 --> 00:01:32.730
And they hang before
in him like clothes

00:01:32.730 --> 00:01:34.580
left to dry in the wind.

00:01:34.580 --> 00:01:37.120
He follows the smooth
blue ridges of her veins

00:01:37.120 --> 00:01:41.800
up to her calves, her fingers,
her breasts, her neck,

00:01:41.800 --> 00:01:45.160
to the soft and downy
lobes of her ears.

00:01:45.160 --> 00:01:48.460
When he looks into her face,
she smiles, and his surprise

00:01:48.460 --> 00:01:50.450
becomes recognition.

00:01:50.450 --> 00:01:53.590
His thirst disappears as
the scent of a nearby river

00:01:53.590 --> 00:01:57.190
fills his nose and
mouth, whets his tongue.

00:01:57.190 --> 00:01:59.430
The man knows that he's
met the love of his life

00:01:59.430 --> 00:02:02.540
and that she is
going to devour him.

00:02:02.540 --> 00:02:04.550
This is an old story.

00:02:04.550 --> 00:02:07.260
While the aroma of clean
water lingers in the air,

00:02:07.260 --> 00:02:11.070
the woman asks the man for
a gift of bread and salt,

00:02:11.070 --> 00:02:14.010
which he will feed to
her with his own fingers.

00:02:14.010 --> 00:02:16.630
He's already trembling,
imagining it.

00:02:16.630 --> 00:02:20.090
His body is vibrating
with desire.

00:02:20.090 --> 00:02:21.960
The man shimmies up
the trunk of the tree

00:02:21.960 --> 00:02:25.120
and swings onto the
branch beside his beloved.

00:02:25.120 --> 00:02:26.780
The closer he gets,
the more she smells

00:02:26.780 --> 00:02:30.210
of river currents, the rush
of waves over mossy rocks,

00:02:30.210 --> 00:02:33.210
releasing the green
musk of water plants.

00:02:33.210 --> 00:02:35.260
Tilting her head to
the side, the woman

00:02:35.260 --> 00:02:37.300
beckons him with her fingers.

00:02:37.300 --> 00:02:41.040
He leans in to kiss
her, closer, closer.

00:02:41.040 --> 00:02:45.120
He bobs his head in time with
her song, and as they embrace,

00:02:45.120 --> 00:02:47.080
her humming rumbles through him.

00:02:47.080 --> 00:02:50.990
He has never felt so entwined
with someone, so protected.

00:02:50.990 --> 00:02:53.820
After a moment, his heart
stops beating and his body

00:02:53.820 --> 00:02:57.480
drops to the forest floor
with a muffled thud.

00:02:57.480 --> 00:02:58.310
What happened next?

00:02:58.310 --> 00:03:01.370
I asked my grandmother, my baba.

00:03:01.370 --> 00:03:05.050
That, she said, depends on
who's telling you the story.

00:03:05.050 --> 00:03:06.836
Most people don't
understand the rusalka

00:03:06.836 --> 00:03:09.335
and so they wouldn't tell you
that she has tears in her eyes

00:03:09.335 --> 00:03:13.470
as she jumps down from the tree
and lands softly in the leaves.

00:03:13.470 --> 00:03:15.870
They wouldn't tell you of
her heaving sobs of regret

00:03:15.870 --> 00:03:19.460
as she walks back to the
river, her body light as air.

00:03:19.460 --> 00:03:21.870
But then again, my baba
said, what most people

00:03:21.870 --> 00:03:24.460
would tell you is also true.

00:03:24.460 --> 00:03:26.110
That she will find another man.

00:03:26.110 --> 00:03:28.020
That she will do it again.

00:03:28.020 --> 00:03:30.310
She will sit in the
tree and sing her song

00:03:30.310 --> 00:03:33.240
as often as she needs
to, take as much strength

00:03:33.240 --> 00:03:36.180
as she requires to survive."

00:03:36.180 --> 00:03:36.710
-Beautiful.

00:03:36.710 --> 00:03:38.100
Thank you for reading.

00:03:38.100 --> 00:03:39.480
ADRIENNE CELT: You're welcome.

00:03:39.480 --> 00:03:42.880
-So my first question
for you, Adrienne,

00:03:42.880 --> 00:03:45.244
is how did you get the
idea for this book?

00:03:45.244 --> 00:03:46.910
ADRIENNE CELT: That
is a great question.

00:03:46.910 --> 00:03:48.640
-Thank you.

00:03:48.640 --> 00:03:50.790
ADRIENNE CELT: So I
started writing this book

00:03:50.790 --> 00:03:53.470
in grad school, and it
began as a short story.

00:03:53.470 --> 00:03:58.440
And part of the idea of
it-- in a certain sense, it

00:03:58.440 --> 00:04:01.370
was an inspiration so I don't
know where it came from.

00:04:01.370 --> 00:04:04.990
But I have two grandmothers,
both of whom are Polish.

00:04:04.990 --> 00:04:08.090
And one of whom, who I
spent a lot of time with,

00:04:08.090 --> 00:04:09.560
was very much a storyteller.

00:04:09.560 --> 00:04:15.550
So some of my interest
both in storytelling

00:04:15.550 --> 00:04:18.610
as an activity within a
family and also as a way

00:04:18.610 --> 00:04:22.079
to pass down information
about culture and family

00:04:22.079 --> 00:04:24.520
comes from experience,
even though the stories

00:04:24.520 --> 00:04:27.830
that my grandmother told
aren't in this book.

00:04:27.830 --> 00:04:30.610
These ones are made up.

00:04:30.610 --> 00:04:34.446
-And how long did it end up
taking you to write the novel?

00:04:34.446 --> 00:04:35.820
ADRIENNE CELT: I
want to say, all

00:04:35.820 --> 00:04:38.710
told, from beginning
to publication,

00:04:38.710 --> 00:04:39.940
probably five years.

00:04:39.940 --> 00:04:40.560
-Five years.

00:04:42.037 --> 00:04:44.370
ADRIENNE CELT: So I started
in grad school with a story.

00:04:44.370 --> 00:04:47.290
And then I expanded that over
the course of maybe a year

00:04:47.290 --> 00:04:49.400
into a novella.

00:04:49.400 --> 00:04:51.780
And then that also
felt too short.

00:04:51.780 --> 00:04:53.650
So I expanded that into a novel.

00:04:53.650 --> 00:04:57.789
And that, again, took at
least a year or so to revise.

00:04:57.789 --> 00:04:59.330
So, you know, it
wasn't like actively

00:04:59.330 --> 00:05:01.810
I was writing eight hours a
day during all of those years.

00:05:01.810 --> 00:05:03.809
I was also in grad school,
writing other things.

00:05:03.809 --> 00:05:04.780
Or I was working.

00:05:04.780 --> 00:05:05.410
-Right.

00:05:05.410 --> 00:05:07.118
ADRIENNE CELT: But
that was the timeline.

00:05:07.118 --> 00:05:09.480
-And in you're in kind
of a unique situation

00:05:09.480 --> 00:05:13.320
because you are working also
almost full-time at Google

00:05:13.320 --> 00:05:15.380
and writing on the side.

00:05:15.380 --> 00:05:17.460
Can you talk a
little bit about how

00:05:17.460 --> 00:05:19.510
you balance those two things?

00:05:19.510 --> 00:05:21.210
ADRIENNE CELT: Yes, I can.

00:05:21.210 --> 00:05:22.690
I have a really strict schedule.

00:05:22.690 --> 00:05:24.770
Sometimes I talk to
people who have children

00:05:24.770 --> 00:05:27.680
and they say having
a strict schedule is

00:05:27.680 --> 00:05:32.210
the only way that I can live my
life and maintain any sanity.

00:05:32.210 --> 00:05:34.230
And I actually feel
exactly the same way

00:05:34.230 --> 00:05:36.180
even though I
don't have a child.

00:05:36.180 --> 00:05:41.399
So I very religiously, so
to speak, write for an hour

00:05:41.399 --> 00:05:42.940
every morning before
I start working,

00:05:42.940 --> 00:05:44.810
which is possible
because I work from home.

00:05:44.810 --> 00:05:48.160
So I can just get up, walk
the dog, write for an hour,

00:05:48.160 --> 00:05:52.550
drink some coffee, and then
get started on daily work.

00:05:52.550 --> 00:05:54.390
But I also don't
work on Fridays.

00:05:54.390 --> 00:05:58.490
So on those days, I either work
all day or go horseback riding,

00:05:58.490 --> 00:06:01.480
and then work the
rest of the day.

00:06:01.480 --> 00:06:03.860
And then I work a
lot on the weekends.

00:06:03.860 --> 00:06:04.360
-Yep.

00:06:04.360 --> 00:06:05.290
Yep.

00:06:05.290 --> 00:06:08.560
And when you were writing
this, were you also searching

00:06:08.560 --> 00:06:10.200
for an agent at the same time?

00:06:10.200 --> 00:06:11.840
Or did you finish
the novel and then

00:06:11.840 --> 00:06:14.350
go through the process of
searching through and searching

00:06:14.350 --> 00:06:15.670
for an agent?

00:06:15.670 --> 00:06:18.280
ADRIENNE CELT: I finished a
full draft-- I think, probably,

00:06:18.280 --> 00:06:19.930
two full drafts-- of
the novel before I

00:06:19.930 --> 00:06:21.570
started looking for an agent.

00:06:21.570 --> 00:06:25.730
And then I talked to a
couple of different people,

00:06:25.730 --> 00:06:29.020
and based on their feedback,
actually ended up revising it

00:06:29.020 --> 00:06:32.690
another time before I went
on another serious search

00:06:32.690 --> 00:06:35.730
for an agent and got
signed with my agent.

00:06:35.730 --> 00:06:38.910
-Do you have any advice
for aspiring writers

00:06:38.910 --> 00:06:42.410
within the Google community
in terms of finding an agent?

00:06:42.410 --> 00:06:45.070
ADRIENNE CELT:
Google can help you.

00:06:45.070 --> 00:06:46.420
Not the company--

00:06:46.420 --> 00:06:47.580
BOTH: The search engine.

00:06:47.580 --> 00:06:48.080
-Yeah.

00:06:48.080 --> 00:06:50.580
ADRIENNE CELT:
But, first of all,

00:06:50.580 --> 00:06:54.640
I would say be really sure that
the book is done before you're

00:06:54.640 --> 00:06:55.519
ready to send it out.

00:06:55.519 --> 00:06:57.810
I mean, that's different if
you are writing nonfiction.

00:06:57.810 --> 00:06:59.180
I don't know as much about that.

00:06:59.180 --> 00:07:00.970
I know that that can
be sold on proposal.

00:07:00.970 --> 00:07:03.091
In fact, it's usually
sold on proposal.

00:07:03.091 --> 00:07:04.840
With fiction, you want
to have a book that

00:07:04.840 --> 00:07:08.290
is-- that you feel is as
good as you can make it.

00:07:08.290 --> 00:07:09.980
So probably not the first draft.

00:07:09.980 --> 00:07:13.510
So first thing I would say,
put it aside for a few weeks

00:07:13.510 --> 00:07:14.554
after you're done.

00:07:14.554 --> 00:07:16.970
Give it to a couple of people
you trust who are not agents

00:07:16.970 --> 00:07:18.270
and have them read it.

00:07:18.270 --> 00:07:22.450
And just marinate on what
they say and what you think.

00:07:22.450 --> 00:07:26.140
And revise a lot.

00:07:26.140 --> 00:07:29.130
But then in terms, like
in a practical sense,

00:07:29.130 --> 00:07:31.910
there's a ton of
agents out there.

00:07:31.910 --> 00:07:36.940
And so you really want to
not be carpet bombing them.

00:07:36.940 --> 00:07:40.900
Although you do want to
contact probably a lot of them.

00:07:40.900 --> 00:07:43.457
A good place to start is to
look in the acknowledgement

00:07:43.457 --> 00:07:45.040
pages of books that
you like, that you

00:07:45.040 --> 00:07:47.940
think are kind of like the
book that you wrote, and see

00:07:47.940 --> 00:07:49.262
who those people's agents are.

00:07:49.262 --> 00:07:50.720
And that gives you
a starting point

00:07:50.720 --> 00:07:52.750
because you can
research their agencies,

00:07:52.750 --> 00:07:57.170
see if they have young agents
that also might be a good fit.

00:07:57.170 --> 00:08:01.930
And then from there, you can
see who their other clients are.

00:08:01.930 --> 00:08:04.060
You can also go to websites
like Poets &amp; Writers

00:08:04.060 --> 00:08:08.190
and Writer's Digest, and
they'll have a long list

00:08:08.190 --> 00:08:11.500
of agents of all stripes.

00:08:11.500 --> 00:08:14.470
Also, being up on, like,
literary Twitter helps.

00:08:14.470 --> 00:08:16.030
-What is the literary Twitter?

00:08:16.030 --> 00:08:18.180
ADRIENNE CELT: Just
the literary community

00:08:18.180 --> 00:08:19.356
as it exists on Twitter.

00:08:19.356 --> 00:08:19.855
-I see.

00:08:19.855 --> 00:08:23.210
And so you're very involved
with the Twitter community?

00:08:23.210 --> 00:08:25.110
ADRIENNE CELT:
Probably too involved.

00:08:25.110 --> 00:08:25.610
Yeah.

00:08:25.610 --> 00:08:29.520
It gets a little
bit self-amplifying.

00:08:29.520 --> 00:08:32.370
But there are a lot of people
on there and a lot of people

00:08:32.370 --> 00:08:34.200
who are willing to
conversations with you,

00:08:34.200 --> 00:08:35.510
no matter what level you're at.

00:08:35.510 --> 00:08:36.850
And there are agents.

00:08:36.850 --> 00:08:39.263
You don't mostly want to be
pitching them on Twitter.

00:08:39.263 --> 00:08:41.179
But you can get a sense
of who they work with,

00:08:41.179 --> 00:08:42.640
and what kind of
person they are,

00:08:42.640 --> 00:08:44.020
and what their interests are.

00:08:44.020 --> 00:08:45.170
And then when
you're writing them

00:08:45.170 --> 00:08:46.878
a query letter, which
is how you actually

00:08:46.878 --> 00:08:51.460
get in touch with an agent, you
can mention in the first, like,

00:08:51.460 --> 00:08:53.560
sentence or two, like,
I saw you on Twitter

00:08:53.560 --> 00:08:55.727
that you did X, Y, and
Z. And that just makes

00:08:55.727 --> 00:08:56.810
it a little more personal.

00:08:56.810 --> 00:08:59.300
And it lets them know that you
actually did your homework,

00:08:59.300 --> 00:09:01.270
and know who they are,
and what they like,

00:09:01.270 --> 00:09:03.144
and that's why you're
sending them your book.

00:09:03.144 --> 00:09:05.810
Instead of just having them
feel like you're sending

00:09:05.810 --> 00:09:07.470
them a "Dear Sir or Madam."

00:09:07.470 --> 00:09:07.970
-Right.

00:09:07.970 --> 00:09:12.550
And how many query letters is
typical for someone to write?

00:09:12.550 --> 00:09:14.590
How many query letters
did you send out?

00:09:14.590 --> 00:09:17.860
ADRIENNE CELT: There probably
isn't a typical number.

00:09:17.860 --> 00:09:22.140
I probably sent out
20, I want to say.

00:09:22.140 --> 00:09:25.684
And of those 20, some
of them were nice no's.

00:09:25.684 --> 00:09:27.225
Some of them were
total no responses.

00:09:30.800 --> 00:09:34.690
A few of them were really
in-depth analyses of the book

00:09:34.690 --> 00:09:37.050
as they saw it.

00:09:37.050 --> 00:09:39.920
And then one was my agent.

00:09:39.920 --> 00:09:43.300
-And then once you
have found your agent,

00:09:43.300 --> 00:09:46.300
how long did it take
until you found someone

00:09:46.300 --> 00:09:47.960
to publish the book?

00:09:47.960 --> 00:09:50.280
ADRIENNE CELT: I want to
say another couple of months

00:09:50.280 --> 00:09:52.550
after that.

00:09:52.550 --> 00:09:53.930
We revised it.

00:09:53.930 --> 00:09:56.370
And then we send out on a
couple of rounds of submissions

00:09:56.370 --> 00:09:59.460
and ended up-- there were
a few different people

00:09:59.460 --> 00:10:00.440
who showed interest.

00:10:00.440 --> 00:10:05.540
And the person we sold it
to, Katie Adams at Liveright,

00:10:05.540 --> 00:10:07.570
was the best one.

00:10:07.570 --> 00:10:08.460
-Great.

00:10:08.460 --> 00:10:11.430
And so when you were
going through revisions

00:10:11.430 --> 00:10:15.530
with your publisher, what kinds
of revisions did they ask for?

00:10:15.530 --> 00:10:19.890
How did you change the story?

00:10:19.890 --> 00:10:22.320
ADRIENNE CELT: So one
example, just an example

00:10:22.320 --> 00:10:25.790
of a revision that we made,
was we cut an entire chapter.

00:10:25.790 --> 00:10:26.290
-Wow.

00:10:26.290 --> 00:10:27.665
ADRIENNE CELT:
The reason that we

00:10:27.665 --> 00:10:31.230
cut it is that my editor
felt, and I agreed,

00:10:31.230 --> 00:10:34.850
that it distracted attention
from the main storyline

00:10:34.850 --> 00:10:40.020
in a way that really
pulled emotional focus.

00:10:40.020 --> 00:10:42.930
One of her really great
insights, I thought,

00:10:42.930 --> 00:10:46.304
was that the main thrust of
the story in the present day.

00:10:46.304 --> 00:10:48.220
You know, there are a
lot of different threads

00:10:48.220 --> 00:10:50.590
in this book-- in the
past, in the present,

00:10:50.590 --> 00:10:55.610
in the near past versus the
distant past, et cetera.

00:10:55.610 --> 00:11:00.120
And she sort of honed in on
what the most important thing

00:11:00.120 --> 00:11:05.190
happening in the present was in
terms of the arc of the novel.

00:11:05.190 --> 00:11:08.400
That being the
relationship between Lulu,

00:11:08.400 --> 00:11:10.670
the main character,
and her mother, Sarah.

00:11:10.670 --> 00:11:18.190
And how bringing that to
a climax and then a close.

00:11:18.190 --> 00:11:18.700
-I see.

00:11:18.700 --> 00:11:21.080
ADRIENNE CELT: So anyway,
cutting that chapter

00:11:21.080 --> 00:11:22.880
helped focus on that.

00:11:22.880 --> 00:11:25.320
-As you were talking,
it reminded me

00:11:25.320 --> 00:11:27.110
of another question
I wanted to ask you,

00:11:27.110 --> 00:11:29.630
which is that the
novel does jump around

00:11:29.630 --> 00:11:32.590
between the past and
the present quite a bit

00:11:32.590 --> 00:11:35.450
and I was wondering
if you wrote the novel

00:11:35.450 --> 00:11:37.980
in chronological order,
if you mapped it out

00:11:37.980 --> 00:11:40.030
before you wrote it, if
you just let the words

00:11:40.030 --> 00:11:41.650
flow from your fingertips.

00:11:41.650 --> 00:11:44.920
What is your writing
process like?

00:11:44.920 --> 00:11:46.920
ADRIENNE CELT: So it's
different for everything.

00:11:46.920 --> 00:11:49.990
But in this case, I did not
write it chronologically

00:11:49.990 --> 00:11:50.690
at all.

00:11:50.690 --> 00:11:52.410
I mean, there are
parts of the book

00:11:52.410 --> 00:11:56.850
that I did write in the
order that they appear here.

00:11:56.850 --> 00:11:59.530
But because there
are so many threads,

00:11:59.530 --> 00:12:01.670
and because the
different threads

00:12:01.670 --> 00:12:04.230
interact with each other
on different levels,

00:12:04.230 --> 00:12:06.950
and can interact with each
other on different levels,

00:12:06.950 --> 00:12:10.260
it's actually was a very modular
book as I was writing it.

00:12:10.260 --> 00:12:12.880
And so I reorganized it a lot.

00:12:12.880 --> 00:12:16.860
And that was part-- that was
another edit that Katie made.

00:12:16.860 --> 00:12:20.900
She switched-- the order
of two chapters in a way

00:12:20.900 --> 00:12:23.900
that I really liked.

00:12:23.900 --> 00:12:30.070
So I do tend to try to
write from start to finish,

00:12:30.070 --> 00:12:32.330
but it does doesn't always work.

00:12:32.330 --> 00:12:34.300
You can't control it.

00:12:34.300 --> 00:12:34.800
-Right.

00:12:34.800 --> 00:12:37.480
This book more than-- I'm
working on another book now.

00:12:37.480 --> 00:12:40.930
And that book I did write
more in a linear fashion

00:12:40.930 --> 00:12:42.780
than this one, I would say.

00:12:42.780 --> 00:12:45.780
-And that book, what is
your next book about?

00:12:45.780 --> 00:12:48.237
ADRIENNE CELT: My
next book is still

00:12:48.237 --> 00:12:49.570
in the process of being written.

00:12:49.570 --> 00:12:52.510
So it's still sort of a secret.

00:12:52.510 --> 00:12:56.840
But it is on the basic
level about a girl who's

00:12:56.840 --> 00:12:59.990
in the wrong place at the
wrong time in a southern border

00:12:59.990 --> 00:13:02.110
town in Arizona and
ends up kidnapped

00:13:02.110 --> 00:13:05.140
by a couple of
members of a cartel.

00:13:05.140 --> 00:13:07.850
And then ends up
on a horseback ride

00:13:07.850 --> 00:13:09.970
throughout northern Mexico.

00:13:09.970 --> 00:13:12.790
And it's a little bit, you
know, it's an adventure story,

00:13:12.790 --> 00:13:13.310
hopefully.

00:13:13.310 --> 00:13:14.190
-Right.

00:13:14.190 --> 00:13:16.620
ADRIENNE CELT:
But it's also sort

00:13:16.620 --> 00:13:20.630
of a meditation on how
much your mind-- how

00:13:20.630 --> 00:13:27.380
much of your experience you
can rely on people believing,

00:13:27.380 --> 00:13:31.190
and therefore how much what
you experience of something

00:13:31.190 --> 00:13:33.510
is true when the
outside world is going

00:13:33.510 --> 00:13:34.890
to perceive it a different way.

00:13:34.890 --> 00:13:38.440
Which is, actually, although
they're very different books,

00:13:38.440 --> 00:13:41.530
I would say that that element is
also present, in a certain way,

00:13:41.530 --> 00:13:47.190
in "The Daughters" because you
get the storyline-- the stories

00:13:47.190 --> 00:13:50.030
the protagonist is told
by her grandmother, Ada,

00:13:50.030 --> 00:13:52.560
about what happened in
their family's history

00:13:52.560 --> 00:13:56.110
in Poland are very magical
and mystical fairy tales.

00:13:56.110 --> 00:13:59.990
But the same stories are told
very differently by her mother,

00:13:59.990 --> 00:14:04.050
in a more realistic,
sort of darker sense.

00:14:04.050 --> 00:14:05.020
So, yeah.

00:14:05.020 --> 00:14:10.402
-Is there a version of the truth
that you tend to believe more?

00:14:10.402 --> 00:14:12.610
Do you align yourself with
the grandmother's version?

00:14:12.610 --> 00:14:15.280
Or do you align yourself with
the mother's more realistic

00:14:15.280 --> 00:14:15.780
version?

00:14:15.780 --> 00:14:17.410
ADRIENNE CELT: For a second,
I thought you meant in life.

00:14:17.410 --> 00:14:17.780
-No.

00:14:17.780 --> 00:14:17.965
No.

00:14:17.965 --> 00:14:18.150
No.

00:14:18.150 --> 00:14:19.775
ADRIENNE CELT: I was
like, I don't know

00:14:19.775 --> 00:14:21.859
-In your book.

00:14:21.859 --> 00:14:23.400
ADRIENNE CELT: I
think I'd probably--

00:14:23.400 --> 00:14:26.740
like Lulu, the protagonist,
I sort of hover somewhere

00:14:26.740 --> 00:14:28.250
between them.

00:14:28.250 --> 00:14:31.950
I think that both Ada,
the grandmother and Sarah,

00:14:31.950 --> 00:14:34.640
the mother, have their reasons
for believing that things

00:14:34.640 --> 00:14:36.040
happened the way they happened.

00:14:36.040 --> 00:14:38.811
And they have their reasons for
saying the way things happened

00:14:38.811 --> 00:14:40.810
the way they happened,
which are not necessarily

00:14:40.810 --> 00:14:43.220
the same things.

00:14:43.220 --> 00:14:45.710
And I think that
their experiences

00:14:45.710 --> 00:14:49.670
are as real as any reality,
in a certain sense.

00:14:49.670 --> 00:14:52.905
So they are both
important for Lulu,

00:14:52.905 --> 00:14:54.780
and therefore, they're
both important for me.

00:14:54.780 --> 00:14:55.420
-I see.

00:14:55.420 --> 00:14:57.295
Do you have a favorite
character in the book?

00:14:59.085 --> 00:15:00.460
ADRIENNE CELT:
That's like asking

00:15:00.460 --> 00:15:02.320
a mother with many children.

00:15:02.320 --> 00:15:04.960
It's fun to write the bad guy.

00:15:04.960 --> 00:15:08.910
So in this book, Sarah is sort
of-- she's not the bad guy,

00:15:08.910 --> 00:15:10.490
but she's a dark character.

00:15:10.490 --> 00:15:13.250
And so she was a lot of fun to
write-- Sarah, the estranged

00:15:13.250 --> 00:15:15.380
mother of the protagonist.

00:15:15.380 --> 00:15:16.850
-Was there a
character in the book

00:15:16.850 --> 00:15:20.570
that was very difficult
for you to write?

00:15:20.570 --> 00:15:22.110
ADRIENNE CELT: I
would say, maybe,

00:15:22.110 --> 00:15:24.890
Lulu's husband, John,
was hard for me to write.

00:15:24.890 --> 00:15:28.336
-And what was challenging
about writing him?

00:15:28.336 --> 00:15:29.960
ADRIENNE CELT:
Partially, just the fact

00:15:29.960 --> 00:15:32.560
that in my initial vision for
the book-- because it started

00:15:32.560 --> 00:15:35.300
out-- it went through all of
these different permutations

00:15:35.300 --> 00:15:39.130
in terms of size and
focus, originally

00:15:39.130 --> 00:15:44.280
I had this idea that it would
almost not involve men at all.

00:15:44.280 --> 00:15:46.920
And that ended up not
being emotionally realistic

00:15:46.920 --> 00:15:47.840
for the book.

00:15:47.840 --> 00:15:50.510
But he was a
character that then I

00:15:50.510 --> 00:15:53.705
had to do a lot of thinking
about what he meant to Lulu

00:15:53.705 --> 00:15:56.050
and what he meant to the story.

00:15:56.050 --> 00:15:59.520
So because he wasn't as much
part of my original vision,

00:15:59.520 --> 00:16:01.910
I guess, that made it
harder for me to write him.

00:16:01.910 --> 00:16:04.100
-So one thing that you
include in the story

00:16:04.100 --> 00:16:07.090
is-- well, one of the
main threads in the story

00:16:07.090 --> 00:16:09.000
is about music.

00:16:09.000 --> 00:16:11.390
Did you have to do
a lot of research

00:16:11.390 --> 00:16:13.410
in order to write that
component of the book?

00:16:13.410 --> 00:16:14.910
ADRIENNE CELT: Do
you mean you don't

00:16:14.910 --> 00:16:16.170
think I'm an opera singer?

00:16:16.170 --> 00:16:18.210
-Well, I can tell if
you're an opera singer.

00:16:18.210 --> 00:16:20.705
But I was wondering if you
had to do additional research?

00:16:20.705 --> 00:16:21.455
ADRIENNE CELT: No.

00:16:21.455 --> 00:16:24.780
So I'm not an opera singer.

00:16:24.780 --> 00:16:27.600
So a lot of the
book was actually

00:16:27.600 --> 00:16:29.020
written before I
did the research

00:16:29.020 --> 00:16:30.520
that I am about to describe.

00:16:30.520 --> 00:16:34.282
And so the first research
that I did was just--

00:16:34.282 --> 00:16:35.740
I did play music
when I was younger

00:16:35.740 --> 00:16:39.550
and I have a very passionate
attachment to music.

00:16:39.550 --> 00:16:41.620
But I'm not a musician.

00:16:41.620 --> 00:16:44.220
I wouldn't call
myself a musician now.

00:16:44.220 --> 00:16:46.564
So I did a lot of
listening to music.

00:16:46.564 --> 00:16:47.730
A lot of listening to opera.

00:16:47.730 --> 00:16:49.477
A lot of reading about opera.

00:16:49.477 --> 00:16:50.810
And then I took singing lessons.

00:16:50.810 --> 00:16:52.940
I did take voice
lessons with an opera

00:16:52.940 --> 00:16:56.730
voice-- like a vocal coach--
while I was in grad school.

00:16:56.730 --> 00:17:00.990
And I wouldn't say that I
got really good at singing,

00:17:00.990 --> 00:17:03.577
but she kept
encouraging me to try.

00:17:03.577 --> 00:17:05.410
She's like, your voice
could hit high notes.

00:17:05.410 --> 00:17:07.960
You should try to
hit the high notes.

00:17:07.960 --> 00:17:11.626
And I was like, I don't
think you're right.

00:17:11.626 --> 00:17:13.250
But that's beautiful
that you think so.

00:17:13.250 --> 00:17:15.970
-Yeah.

00:17:15.970 --> 00:17:17.690
ADRIENNE CELT:
But in doing that,

00:17:17.690 --> 00:17:20.740
I learned a lot about the
physical expression of music.

00:17:20.740 --> 00:17:25.569
And I also learned a lot about
the way opera people talk.

00:17:25.569 --> 00:17:27.640
Like that.

00:17:27.640 --> 00:17:29.570
Not like that.

00:17:29.570 --> 00:17:31.900
I interviewed that
teacher as well.

00:17:31.900 --> 00:17:34.490
And she gave me a lot of
insights in terms of the opera

00:17:34.490 --> 00:17:37.260
world and the idea
of a musician's body,

00:17:37.260 --> 00:17:39.030
a singer's body,
as an instrument.

00:17:39.030 --> 00:17:42.170
That came in very, very handy.

00:17:42.170 --> 00:17:47.540
-Were you sad when you were
finished writing the book?

00:17:47.540 --> 00:17:49.510
ADRIENNE CELT: I don't
know because it was such

00:17:49.510 --> 00:17:53.490
a long process of finishing.

00:17:53.490 --> 00:17:55.820
There was the time that
I finished and signed

00:17:55.820 --> 00:17:57.690
with my agent, and
I was just happy.

00:17:57.690 --> 00:18:00.550
There was the time when I
sold it, and I was just happy.

00:18:00.550 --> 00:18:02.250
And then there were
the edits and I

00:18:02.250 --> 00:18:03.752
was relieved when they
were done because they

00:18:03.752 --> 00:18:04.876
were kind of on a timeline.

00:18:04.876 --> 00:18:07.360
And then after that,
there were copy edits.

00:18:07.360 --> 00:18:10.810
And after that, there were
two rounds of proofreading.

00:18:10.810 --> 00:18:13.330
So it took a long
time to be done.

00:18:13.330 --> 00:18:16.490
And in the middle of all that,
I started writing my new book.

00:18:16.490 --> 00:18:18.450
So I don't think I
had as much as the

00:18:18.450 --> 00:18:20.600
like postpartum depression.

00:18:20.600 --> 00:18:22.840
Which I don't say just
because mothers and children

00:18:22.840 --> 00:18:24.630
are a theme in this book.

00:18:24.630 --> 00:18:27.289
People really do talk
about it that way.

00:18:27.289 --> 00:18:28.580
I don't think I had it as much.

00:18:28.580 --> 00:18:32.460
I feel like maybe now that I'm
releasing it into the world,

00:18:32.460 --> 00:18:34.760
I'm starting to get to
the end of the period

00:18:34.760 --> 00:18:37.160
where it's going to
be exciting for people

00:18:37.160 --> 00:18:39.190
to talk about on
literary Twitter.

00:18:39.190 --> 00:18:42.490
Now, I'm sort of like, oh,
but it's my book that I did.

00:18:42.490 --> 00:18:44.930
Let's always be excited
about it forever.

00:18:44.930 --> 00:18:45.670
-Right.

00:18:45.670 --> 00:18:47.410
Right.

00:18:47.410 --> 00:18:48.410
ADRIENNE CELT: But yeah.

00:18:48.410 --> 00:18:53.030
So, I guess, no, but
I feel it coming.

00:18:53.030 --> 00:18:56.590
-Speaking about putting the
book out into the world,

00:18:56.590 --> 00:18:59.330
as a first time
published author,

00:18:59.330 --> 00:19:02.070
what has it been like for
you reading the reviews

00:19:02.070 --> 00:19:04.870
and getting feedback
from the outside world?

00:19:04.870 --> 00:19:06.600
ADRIENNE CELT: Really weird.

00:19:06.600 --> 00:19:11.000
I mean, any writer, once
you get to the point

00:19:11.000 --> 00:19:14.090
of being published, publishing
a whole book, for the most part,

00:19:14.090 --> 00:19:17.520
you're probably going to have--
and God, I hope for all of you

00:19:17.520 --> 00:19:20.630
aspiring writers out there,
you have some experience

00:19:20.630 --> 00:19:24.150
with other types of submission
and rejection and acceptance

00:19:24.150 --> 00:19:27.620
before you get there-- that it
helps you develop a thick skin.

00:19:27.620 --> 00:19:29.450
I have published quite
a few short stories

00:19:29.450 --> 00:19:30.670
in literary magazines.

00:19:30.670 --> 00:19:35.550
So I know very intimately
the process of being just

00:19:35.550 --> 00:19:38.950
rejected out of hand,
or lavishly praised,

00:19:38.950 --> 00:19:41.900
or you publish something
and nobody cares.

00:19:41.900 --> 00:19:45.290
So, like, I experienced
all that before and so

00:19:45.290 --> 00:19:47.490
I didn't anticipate it
being as big of a deal.

00:19:47.490 --> 00:19:52.260
But it is a very vulnerable
feeling, in a strange way.

00:19:52.260 --> 00:19:54.960
Even if you're used
to having people--

00:19:54.960 --> 00:19:57.750
I'm not at all weird about
the idea of people reading it.

00:19:57.750 --> 00:20:02.430
That doesn't make me feel sad
or scared or anything like that.

00:20:02.430 --> 00:20:05.910
But it is amazing,
that being the case.

00:20:05.910 --> 00:20:08.745
And even being able to
be analytical about,

00:20:08.745 --> 00:20:10.550
oh, OK, no one review matters.

00:20:10.550 --> 00:20:12.700
It's very strange to
see people read-- talk

00:20:12.700 --> 00:20:16.125
about it on Amazon or Twitter
or Goodreads or whatever.

00:20:16.125 --> 00:20:19.310
And you're just like,
but you-- you're not--

00:20:19.310 --> 00:20:21.820
how-- you don't even
know what it's like.

00:20:21.820 --> 00:20:24.175
And then you just
think-- you just

00:20:24.175 --> 00:20:26.659
have to teach yourself to
put it aside and not care.

00:20:26.659 --> 00:20:28.200
Especially since a
lot of the reviews

00:20:28.200 --> 00:20:29.200
have been very positive.

00:20:29.200 --> 00:20:32.540
And it's just easier to let
that wash all over you--

00:20:32.540 --> 00:20:33.040
-Right.

00:20:33.040 --> 00:20:35.240
ADRIENNE CELT: --than it
is to let the one guy who

00:20:35.240 --> 00:20:37.500
didn't like it wash past you.

00:20:37.500 --> 00:20:38.340
-Right.

00:20:38.340 --> 00:20:40.050
Do you even read the
negative reviews?

00:20:40.050 --> 00:20:41.090
Or do you try to--

00:20:41.090 --> 00:20:41.830
ADRIENNE CELT: I try not to.

00:20:41.830 --> 00:20:41.960
-Yes.

00:20:41.960 --> 00:20:42.793
ADRIENNE CELT: Yeah.

00:20:42.793 --> 00:20:44.420
Because it's just not worth it.

00:20:44.420 --> 00:20:48.530
-And who was the first person
that you let read your book?

00:20:48.530 --> 00:20:52.240
ADRIENNE CELT: Probably one
of my grad school professors.

00:20:52.240 --> 00:20:54.700
There were several people
who read pieces of it

00:20:54.700 --> 00:20:58.530
in grad school as I
was working on it.

00:20:58.530 --> 00:21:01.660
And then my friend Brandon Boyer
White, who is also a writer.

00:21:01.660 --> 00:21:05.620
And, although it sounds like
she's a man, she's a woman.

00:21:05.620 --> 00:21:10.310
She is probably my first
reader in most things.

00:21:10.310 --> 00:21:14.300
-I remember we were working
together when you were actually

00:21:14.300 --> 00:21:16.370
working on this story.

00:21:16.370 --> 00:21:17.130
Yes.

00:21:17.130 --> 00:21:20.910
And I believe that the first
title for the novel that you

00:21:20.910 --> 00:21:22.850
had was "Rusalka."

00:21:22.850 --> 00:21:24.100
And now it's "The Daughters."

00:21:24.100 --> 00:21:27.000
Can you talk about why
you changed the title?

00:21:27.000 --> 00:21:28.600
ADRIENNE CELT: I can, yes.

00:21:28.600 --> 00:21:29.880
So, Rusalka.

00:21:29.880 --> 00:21:34.390
The myth of the rusalka is
a Polish and Slavic myth

00:21:34.390 --> 00:21:36.240
about a water spirit.

00:21:36.240 --> 00:21:39.070
The excerpt that I
read at the beginning

00:21:39.070 --> 00:21:41.485
is actually sort of a
retelling of that myth.

00:21:41.485 --> 00:21:43.530
She's sort of a wraith.

00:21:45.140 --> 00:21:48.560
So one of my first readers
read the beginning of the book,

00:21:48.560 --> 00:21:51.519
and he looked at me-- and he's
very serious literary fiction

00:21:51.519 --> 00:21:53.060
person-- and he
said, I knew you were

00:21:53.060 --> 00:21:56.570
writing a book about vampires.

00:21:56.570 --> 00:21:59.760
And actually, he
was kind of right.

00:21:59.760 --> 00:22:02.802
So that's important because
of the Polish history

00:22:02.802 --> 00:22:04.010
that weaves through the book.

00:22:04.010 --> 00:22:08.350
But "Rusalka" is also
also a Dvorak opera.

00:22:08.350 --> 00:22:12.920
So those two elements
ended up becoming

00:22:12.920 --> 00:22:14.650
very important in
the book, and so that

00:22:14.650 --> 00:22:16.290
was sort of a natural title.

00:22:16.290 --> 00:22:20.820
But the reason I changed it, my
publisher wanted to change it.

00:22:20.820 --> 00:22:23.627
Not my editor so much as the
marketing team, who you, sort

00:22:23.627 --> 00:22:25.180
of, have to do what they say.

00:22:25.180 --> 00:22:29.140
And I was sad to change it
but I kind of saw it coming.

00:22:29.140 --> 00:22:31.980
Because a lot of times,
people who know about opera

00:22:31.980 --> 00:22:34.270
or know about Polish
history are all really sad

00:22:34.270 --> 00:22:35.600
that I changed it.

00:22:35.600 --> 00:22:38.330
But people who don't
would hear the old title

00:22:38.330 --> 00:22:39.810
and say, oh, that's so cool.

00:22:39.810 --> 00:22:41.460
Rus-ka what?

00:22:41.460 --> 00:22:43.182
And so "The Daughters"--

00:22:43.182 --> 00:22:44.640
-It's a little
easier to pronounce.

00:22:44.640 --> 00:22:46.556
ADRIENNE CELT: It's a
lot easier to pronounce.

00:22:46.556 --> 00:22:48.420
It's easier to remember.

00:22:48.420 --> 00:22:54.460
And I still think it
has a very strong tang.

00:22:54.460 --> 00:22:56.020
It's a little bit creepy.

00:22:56.020 --> 00:22:57.300
It's also lovely.

00:22:57.300 --> 00:23:00.870
It's fitting because
there is this lineage

00:23:00.870 --> 00:23:03.440
of daughters in the book.

00:23:03.440 --> 00:23:05.522
And my only hesitation
about it was

00:23:05.522 --> 00:23:07.980
that I feel like there are a
lot of books in the world that

00:23:07.980 --> 00:23:13.610
are "The Shoemaker's Daughter"
or "The Bread Baker's

00:23:13.610 --> 00:23:14.170
Daughter."

00:23:14.170 --> 00:23:17.040
And no offense to those books--
it's hard to title a book,

00:23:17.040 --> 00:23:19.060
and I'm sure they
are lovely books--

00:23:19.060 --> 00:23:22.500
but I thought that it might
get kind of lost in those.

00:23:22.500 --> 00:23:24.647
What I ended up thinking
is that I really

00:23:24.647 --> 00:23:27.230
like this title because it's a
little bit different than that.

00:23:27.230 --> 00:23:29.690
Instead of focusing
on trying to tag

00:23:29.690 --> 00:23:33.430
the women of the
novel to a paternal

00:23:33.430 --> 00:23:35.140
figure that they are
the daughters of.

00:23:35.140 --> 00:23:36.410
They are themselves.

00:23:36.410 --> 00:23:38.140
It is about the
daughters themselves.

00:23:38.140 --> 00:23:40.220
And they only come
from one another.

00:23:40.220 --> 00:23:40.880
-Right.

00:23:40.880 --> 00:23:42.060
Right.

00:23:42.060 --> 00:23:45.200
Speaking of the marketing
team's influence

00:23:45.200 --> 00:23:49.420
on decisions that were made
about the book, how much say

00:23:49.420 --> 00:23:51.612
did you have in
the cover design?

00:23:51.612 --> 00:23:53.070
ADRIENNE CELT: The
beautiful cover.

00:23:53.070 --> 00:23:54.306
-The beautiful cover design.

00:23:54.306 --> 00:23:55.680
ADRIENNE CELT: I
think I probably

00:23:55.680 --> 00:23:57.510
had more than some people.

00:23:57.510 --> 00:23:58.674
I didn't design it.

00:23:58.674 --> 00:24:00.590
The wonderful people at
Liveright designed it.

00:24:00.590 --> 00:24:02.700
A lot of people have asked
me if I drew the cover.

00:24:02.700 --> 00:24:04.870
And I did not.

00:24:04.870 --> 00:24:07.110
But I love it a lot.

00:24:07.110 --> 00:24:10.177
They showed me-- I had no
interaction with them at all.

00:24:10.177 --> 00:24:11.760
Like I didn't tell
them what I wanted.

00:24:11.760 --> 00:24:14.820
I didn't-- nothing like that.

00:24:14.820 --> 00:24:16.880
And then my editor
sent me two options.

00:24:16.880 --> 00:24:20.570
And one of them was
slightly different

00:24:20.570 --> 00:24:22.820
but basically a version of this.

00:24:22.820 --> 00:24:26.290
And me and my agent both sort
of leapt all over this one.

00:24:26.290 --> 00:24:30.340
And the other one was also nice.

00:24:30.340 --> 00:24:32.202
But, I think, they
had been leaning

00:24:32.202 --> 00:24:33.785
towards the other
version, which was--

00:24:33.785 --> 00:24:36.822
it just looked-- it was whiter.

00:24:36.822 --> 00:24:38.030
It looked sort of like stone.

00:24:38.030 --> 00:24:39.360
Like it was carved from stone.

00:24:39.360 --> 00:24:41.930
But to me, in a small,
like, JPEG version,

00:24:41.930 --> 00:24:43.670
it looked like a
wedding invitation.

00:24:43.670 --> 00:24:44.442
-Ah.

00:24:44.442 --> 00:24:47.100
ADRIENNE CELT: And like,
you know, deckled paper.

00:24:47.100 --> 00:24:49.870
And so that was part of why
I leaned towards this one.

00:24:49.870 --> 00:24:51.440
-And, well, it's beautiful.

00:24:51.440 --> 00:24:52.481
ADRIENNE CELT: Thank you.

00:24:52.481 --> 00:24:53.920
People seem to like it.

00:24:53.920 --> 00:24:55.640
-Do you have anything
that you wanted

00:24:55.640 --> 00:24:57.280
to share with the audience?

00:24:57.280 --> 00:24:59.920
I know that you mentioned
something before--

00:24:59.920 --> 00:25:00.920
ADRIENNE CELT: Oh, yeah.

00:25:00.920 --> 00:25:01.510
- --our talk.

00:25:01.510 --> 00:25:04.440
ADRIENNE CELT: Just
in case any Googlers

00:25:04.440 --> 00:25:06.790
who are interested in
this are listening.

00:25:06.790 --> 00:25:09.812
So I was, as Lizzie
knows, I was one

00:25:09.812 --> 00:25:12.020
of the early members of the
"Authors at Google" team.

00:25:12.020 --> 00:25:14.000
And I think that one
of the great things

00:25:14.000 --> 00:25:16.740
that people outside of Google
don't know about Google

00:25:16.740 --> 00:25:19.090
is that there are ways
to sort of carve out

00:25:19.090 --> 00:25:23.000
niches within the company for
what you're passionate about.

00:25:23.000 --> 00:25:26.270
And a lot of those
end up also being

00:25:26.270 --> 00:25:28.090
forms of corporate
philanthropy that

00:25:28.090 --> 00:25:31.170
are really wonderful for the
company and for the world.

00:25:31.170 --> 00:25:33.530
And I think that something
great that Google could do,

00:25:33.530 --> 00:25:36.620
that I would love to
help Google administrate,

00:25:36.620 --> 00:25:40.690
would be to set up a fellowship
for young writers, emerging

00:25:40.690 --> 00:25:41.750
writers.

00:25:41.750 --> 00:25:45.590
So each person-- you'd have
a bunch of people apply.

00:25:45.590 --> 00:25:47.080
I'm sure it would be huge.

00:25:47.080 --> 00:25:49.814
Social media would
lose its mind.

00:25:49.814 --> 00:25:50.480
-So would this--

00:25:50.480 --> 00:25:51.320
ADRIENNE CELT: Literary Twitter.

00:25:51.320 --> 00:25:51.550
- --would this be in?

00:25:51.550 --> 00:25:52.500
ADRIENNE CELT: And they would--

00:25:52.500 --> 00:25:53.280
-Sorry.

00:25:53.280 --> 00:25:55.080
ADRIENNE CELT: So the
way that I imagine

00:25:55.080 --> 00:25:58.997
it, once we picked a
person, or two people, say,

00:25:58.997 --> 00:26:01.330
they would come and they would
have an office at Google.

00:26:01.330 --> 00:26:05.130
And they would have a
lower salary for the year.

00:26:05.130 --> 00:26:06.860
Like a stipend, essentially.

00:26:06.860 --> 00:26:09.970
And they would have
office hours, maybe

00:26:09.970 --> 00:26:11.250
two or three times a week.

00:26:11.250 --> 00:26:13.450
And any Googler
could come to them

00:26:13.450 --> 00:26:16.870
to get advice on either their
own personal writing project

00:26:16.870 --> 00:26:19.190
or a project for Google.

00:26:19.190 --> 00:26:19.690
Whatever.

00:26:19.690 --> 00:26:22.230
Just like feedback
from a working writer.

00:26:22.230 --> 00:26:24.920
And then the writer could
maybe give a workshop

00:26:24.920 --> 00:26:28.290
as well every quarter or
twice a year or something

00:26:28.290 --> 00:26:35.310
like that for Googlers to get
expert advice on their work.

00:26:35.310 --> 00:26:39.260
And, in return, the writer
would get most of their time

00:26:39.260 --> 00:26:41.840
free to work, but
to pursue seriously,

00:26:41.840 --> 00:26:44.110
a project which
is very difficult.

00:26:44.110 --> 00:26:46.030
When you graduate
from an MFA program--

00:26:46.030 --> 00:26:47.730
or if you don't go
to a MFA program--

00:26:47.730 --> 00:26:49.730
and you're just trying
to get by on your day job

00:26:49.730 --> 00:26:52.430
and you're trying to work
on a book, it's hard.

00:26:52.430 --> 00:26:52.930
-Right.

00:26:52.930 --> 00:26:54.138
ADRIENNE CELT: You need time.

00:26:54.138 --> 00:26:56.450
And it's hard without
recognition or something

00:26:56.450 --> 00:26:58.410
that you can sell yourself with.

00:26:58.410 --> 00:27:00.679
And this would be a
really awesome thing.

00:27:00.679 --> 00:27:02.720
Especially in the Bay
Area, where there's already

00:27:02.720 --> 00:27:05.890
so much great focus on things
like the Stegner program

00:27:05.890 --> 00:27:06.850
at Stanford.

00:27:06.850 --> 00:27:08.750
-What's the Stegner program?

00:27:08.750 --> 00:27:10.350
ADRIENNE CELT: It's
something similar

00:27:10.350 --> 00:27:12.465
but it's embedded within
a university setting.

00:27:12.465 --> 00:27:12.965
-I see.

00:27:12.965 --> 00:27:13.260
ADRIENNE CELT: Yeah.

00:27:13.260 --> 00:27:13.790
-I see.

00:27:13.790 --> 00:27:15.870
And would these
be internal people

00:27:15.870 --> 00:27:17.550
who would apply for
this fellowship?

00:27:17.550 --> 00:27:18.680
Or would they be external?

00:27:18.680 --> 00:27:20.240
Or would it be
open to everybody?

00:27:20.240 --> 00:27:22.480
ADRIENNE CELT: Open to
everybody, I would think.

00:27:22.480 --> 00:27:23.680
-Thank you.

00:27:23.680 --> 00:27:27.030
