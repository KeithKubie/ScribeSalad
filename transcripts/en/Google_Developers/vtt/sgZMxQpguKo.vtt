00:00:05.847 --> 00:00:07.930
TIMOTHY JORDAN: We're now
in the Experiments tent,

00:00:07.930 --> 00:00:10.295
and there are so many
cool things to play with.

00:00:10.295 --> 00:00:12.920
Before we get to that-- which is
going to be in just a moment--

00:00:12.920 --> 00:00:16.880
I just want to ask Amit what
experiments are all about.

00:00:16.880 --> 00:00:17.630
SPEAKER 1: Thanks.

00:00:17.630 --> 00:00:20.990
So Experiments are platforms
that we bring out--

00:00:20.990 --> 00:00:21.720
websites.

00:00:21.720 --> 00:00:23.590
Each one is a kind
of a playground that

00:00:23.590 --> 00:00:26.020
invites everybody
to come in and send

00:00:26.020 --> 00:00:27.410
in interesting
and playful things

00:00:27.410 --> 00:00:29.580
that they're doing
with our technologies.

00:00:29.580 --> 00:00:32.439
We have Chrome experiments,
Android experiments web VR

00:00:32.439 --> 00:00:34.220
experiments, and AI experiments.

00:00:34.220 --> 00:00:35.270
They're all there.

00:00:35.270 --> 00:00:36.925
And new platforms will come out.

00:00:36.925 --> 00:00:38.550
And we're very excited
about the things

00:00:38.550 --> 00:00:39.945
that people are doing with them.

00:00:39.945 --> 00:00:42.320
TIMOTHY JORDAN: And a lot of
them are open source, right?

00:00:42.320 --> 00:00:42.770
SPEAKER 1: Yes.

00:00:42.770 --> 00:00:44.430
A lot of them are open
source, which is amazing

00:00:44.430 --> 00:00:46.638
because experimentation is
a wonderful way for people

00:00:46.638 --> 00:00:48.780
to play and discover new
things for themselves.

00:00:48.780 --> 00:00:50.715
But when they share
with the community,

00:00:50.715 --> 00:00:52.090
then everybody
gets to see what's

00:00:52.090 --> 00:00:54.667
possible with AI, what's
possible with web VR.

00:00:54.667 --> 00:00:55.500
It's really amazing.

00:00:55.500 --> 00:00:57.430
And it's also amazing
for us at Google

00:00:57.430 --> 00:00:59.582
to see the surprising
things that sometimes

00:00:59.582 --> 00:01:01.290
happen when people
just have fun and play

00:01:01.290 --> 00:01:02.692
with these technologies.

00:01:02.692 --> 00:01:04.400
TIMOTHY JORDAN: And
lot of them are built

00:01:04.400 --> 00:01:05.669
by people who aren't Googlers.

00:01:05.669 --> 00:01:06.960
SPEAKER 1: Oh yeah, absolutely.

00:01:06.960 --> 00:01:08.800
I mean, there's a
submit button on there.

00:01:08.800 --> 00:01:11.300
And you can just go and send
us the stuff that you're doing,

00:01:11.300 --> 00:01:13.600
the garage, the kind of
passion project that you have.

00:01:13.600 --> 00:01:15.974
And you'd be surprised how
helpful some of these projects

00:01:15.974 --> 00:01:17.580
could be for everybody else.

00:01:17.580 --> 00:01:19.892
Essentially we can get to
get inspired, and imagine

00:01:19.892 --> 00:01:21.350
new things with
these technologies.

00:01:21.350 --> 00:01:23.683
TIMOTHY JORDAN: All right,
let's check some of them out.

00:01:23.683 --> 00:01:24.690
First off is Quickdraw.

00:01:24.690 --> 00:01:25.610
And I'm actually going to play.

00:01:25.610 --> 00:01:27.730
Do you want to narrate
for everybody at home what

00:01:27.730 --> 00:01:28.365
we're doing?

00:01:28.365 --> 00:01:29.531
SPEAKER 1: Yeah, absolutely.

00:01:29.531 --> 00:01:31.150
So Quickdraw-- oh, thanks.

00:01:31.150 --> 00:01:34.320
So you might have actually
played this game at home.

00:01:34.320 --> 00:01:37.250
But this is the multiplayer
version of the game.

00:01:37.250 --> 00:01:39.710
What's happening here is
a machine learning game.

00:01:39.710 --> 00:01:43.490
So you're going
to draw something.

00:01:43.490 --> 00:01:45.230
And the machine is
going to try to guess

00:01:45.230 --> 00:01:46.820
what it is that you're drawing.

00:01:46.820 --> 00:01:49.530
And if the machine can guess
right, you get a point.

00:01:49.530 --> 00:01:51.390
Right, so here we go.

00:01:51.390 --> 00:01:54.510
We've got Timothy,
Adam, and Nick.

00:01:54.510 --> 00:01:58.409
Three two, one, go.

00:01:58.409 --> 00:02:00.700
So the machine is going to
tell them something to draw.

00:02:00.700 --> 00:02:04.480
In this case, for
example, Timothy

00:02:04.480 --> 00:02:07.973
is asked to draw to draw water.

00:02:07.973 --> 00:02:10.389
And you can see over there
that he's trying to draw water.

00:02:10.389 --> 00:02:14.030
And if the machine can guess,
if the computer vision algorithm

00:02:14.030 --> 00:02:15.780
can guess that--

00:02:15.780 --> 00:02:17.320
it's actually the
handwriting API.

00:02:17.320 --> 00:02:19.980
And it can guess that
he got water right,

00:02:19.980 --> 00:02:21.080
then he gets a point.

00:02:21.080 --> 00:02:25.140
So Nick just-- think Nick
is killing it over there.

00:02:25.140 --> 00:02:27.236
He's drawing a train.

00:02:27.236 --> 00:02:33.140
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:02:42.500 --> 00:02:46.020
Well, Adam seems to be
in first place with 14.

00:02:46.020 --> 00:02:47.750
After that, we got
Nick Jonas with 12.

00:02:47.750 --> 00:02:49.360
And Tim-- there
we go, we're done.

00:02:49.360 --> 00:02:49.860
Time's up.

00:02:52.610 --> 00:02:54.750
They're [INAUDIBLE]
with you but it's OK--

00:02:54.750 --> 00:02:58.638

[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:03:01.068 --> 00:03:03.600
TIMOTHY JORDAN: It's
the water that got me.

00:03:03.600 --> 00:03:05.020
How do you draw water?

00:03:05.020 --> 00:03:06.400
I just drew the surface.

00:03:06.400 --> 00:03:06.770
SPEAKER 2: That's
the funny thing,

00:03:06.770 --> 00:03:08.645
some things are perceived
differently, right?

00:03:08.645 --> 00:03:10.840
People think water drops
versus river water, shapes.

00:03:10.840 --> 00:03:12.820
And it's different every time.

00:03:12.820 --> 00:03:13.820
TIMOTHY JORDAN: Awesome.

00:03:13.820 --> 00:03:14.936
Thanks, guys.

00:03:14.936 --> 00:03:16.810
All right, let's go
check out something else.

00:03:16.810 --> 00:03:19.770
There's something that makes
music over there, right?

00:03:19.770 --> 00:03:23.410
SPEAKER 1: OK, so this
is a really exciting one.

00:03:23.410 --> 00:03:26.530
The artist Giorgio Moroder,
who used to be the-- or is,

00:03:26.530 --> 00:03:29.060
actually, he is the
King of europop--

00:03:29.060 --> 00:03:31.130
created this amazing soundtrack.

00:03:31.130 --> 00:03:33.800
And what we've done is we're
using the Computer Vision

00:03:33.800 --> 00:03:38.100
API to go and have the phone
identify different items.

00:03:38.100 --> 00:03:41.110
And then the phone is
actually narrating itself

00:03:41.110 --> 00:03:43.550
as a soundtrack to
the music, telling us

00:03:43.550 --> 00:03:46.100
about what it's seeing,
what it thinks it's seeing,

00:03:46.100 --> 00:03:47.710
as how it's identifying
these objects.

00:03:47.710 --> 00:03:49.830
And that actually becomes
part of the songs.

00:03:49.830 --> 00:03:50.660
TIMOTHY JORDAN:
That's really cool.

00:03:50.660 --> 00:03:53.118
SPEAKER 1: I think it's better
to just listen to it, right?

00:03:53.118 --> 00:03:55.820
TIMOTHY JORDAN: All right,
let's go check it out.

00:03:55.820 --> 00:03:56.480
You guys ready?

00:03:56.480 --> 00:03:58.597
All right, which ones
should we do first?

00:03:58.597 --> 00:03:59.180
We should go--

00:03:59.180 --> 00:04:01.179

00:04:08.330 --> 00:04:08.830
All right.

[GUITAR MUSIC STARTS]

00:04:09.816 --> 00:04:13.270
Is that guitar or not?

Got musical instrument
in this spot.

00:04:17.630 --> 00:04:21.486
OK, what else?

00:04:21.486 --> 00:04:23.414
Yeah-- yeah-- yeah-- yeah--

00:04:23.414 --> 00:04:24.860
I'm on it.

00:04:24.860 --> 00:04:26.610
Looks like automotive
exterior to me.

TIMOTHY JORDAN: This
is really great.

00:04:30.948 --> 00:04:31.448
OK.

00:04:45.325 --> 00:04:47.700
TIMOTHY JORDAN: All right,
I'll leave this with you guys.

00:04:47.700 --> 00:04:49.200
Thank you.

00:04:49.200 --> 00:04:51.680
That was really cool.

00:04:51.680 --> 00:04:52.329
All right.

00:04:52.329 --> 00:04:53.620
Let's try a couple more things.

00:04:53.620 --> 00:04:55.170
That was super fun.

00:04:55.170 --> 00:04:58.480
So this is satellite imagery?

00:04:58.480 --> 00:05:00.230
SPEAKER 1: Yes, this
is satellite imagery.

00:05:00.230 --> 00:05:02.521
It was created by an artist,
Zach Lieberman and the DAX

00:05:02.521 --> 00:05:03.710
team.

00:05:03.710 --> 00:05:05.760
So the idea here
was really simple.

00:05:05.760 --> 00:05:09.140
What if you could search the
world using a simple gesture?

00:05:09.140 --> 00:05:09.640
Right?

00:05:09.640 --> 00:05:11.830
And notice here how it
takes it to different places

00:05:11.830 --> 00:05:13.871
all over the world every
time you draw a gesture.

00:05:13.871 --> 00:05:16.964
So let's just give it a
shot, let's see where we go.

00:05:16.964 --> 00:05:17.880
TIMOTHY JORDAN: Spain.

00:05:28.800 --> 00:05:30.730
SPEAKER 1: So it's
an experiment.

00:05:30.730 --> 00:05:33.060
It's just a really
wonderful experience.

00:05:33.060 --> 00:05:33.560
Right?

00:05:33.560 --> 00:05:34.910
It's not like you'll
be able to like

00:05:34.910 --> 00:05:36.410
find your way to
a specific place

00:05:36.410 --> 00:05:38.214
by drawing a gesture,
that's not the point.

00:05:38.214 --> 00:05:40.380
The point is really-- this
is optimized for a really

00:05:40.380 --> 00:05:44.560
joyful and fun experience.

00:05:44.560 --> 00:05:47.570
Do you want to try the
other mode as well?

00:05:47.570 --> 00:05:50.580
So what it's going to do here is
build this like imaginary city

00:05:50.580 --> 00:05:52.734
built around these tiles.

00:05:52.734 --> 00:05:54.650
And you start dragging
it a certain direction,

00:05:54.650 --> 00:05:58.850
it'll start building a road
by combining all these tiles.

00:05:58.850 --> 00:06:02.320
There's about 50,000
of them that the team

00:06:02.320 --> 00:06:06.970
has processed using various
algorithms to go and create

00:06:06.970 --> 00:06:08.107
this experience.

00:06:12.977 --> 00:06:14.590

00:06:27.000 --> 00:06:28.590
Yeah, it's very
meditative for me.

00:06:28.590 --> 00:06:30.230
You know, we've been
standing here and seeing

00:06:30.230 --> 00:06:31.188
people playing with it.

00:06:31.188 --> 00:06:34.632
And we find ourselves just like
starting-- just like, yeah.

00:06:34.632 --> 00:06:35.340
It's mesmerizing.

00:06:35.340 --> 00:06:37.760
TIMOTHY JORDAN: Kind of zone
out on the satellite image.

00:06:37.760 --> 00:06:38.530
SPEAKER 1: Absolutely.

00:06:38.530 --> 00:06:40.090
TIMOTHY JORDAN: I mean,
the world's a big place.

00:06:40.090 --> 00:06:41.256
SPEAKER 1: It's a big place.

00:06:41.256 --> 00:06:43.807
It gets a little smaller when
you get to travel it this way.

00:06:43.807 --> 00:06:46.140
TIMOTHY JORDAN: I think we
have time for one more thing.

00:06:46.140 --> 00:06:46.920
What should we check out?

00:06:46.920 --> 00:06:47.586
SPEAKER 1: Yeah.

00:06:47.586 --> 00:06:50.540
Let's go check out actually
a submission by students--

00:06:50.540 --> 00:06:53.830
former student, he's
graduated now-- from Denmark.

00:06:53.830 --> 00:06:56.930
And he's created a wonderful
piece using machine learning.

00:06:56.930 --> 00:06:59.600
Very unexpected
interesting piece.

00:06:59.600 --> 00:07:01.130
SPEAKER 4: So this
is Objectifier

00:07:01.130 --> 00:07:02.640
with spacial programming.

00:07:02.640 --> 00:07:04.450
And it's a really
cool machine learning

00:07:04.450 --> 00:07:07.580
device that takes visual
input, processes it

00:07:07.580 --> 00:07:10.290
through TensorFlow, and
ultimately triggers "if this,

00:07:10.290 --> 00:07:11.450
then that" statements.

00:07:11.450 --> 00:07:13.490
So you can imagine putting
your favorite reading

00:07:13.490 --> 00:07:15.790
glasses on would
trigger a reading lamp,

00:07:15.790 --> 00:07:17.830
pulling the sheets up at
night, getting into bed

00:07:17.830 --> 00:07:19.500
will turn all your lights off.

00:07:19.500 --> 00:07:21.380
It can happen on device.

00:07:21.380 --> 00:07:25.680
It was built by a developer,
Bjorn, out of Denmark.

00:07:25.680 --> 00:07:27.560
And if we had the
proper European adapter,

00:07:27.560 --> 00:07:31.120
we could do it all right
within this physical hardware.

00:07:31.120 --> 00:07:33.430
There's a Raspberry
Pi 0 in there.

00:07:33.430 --> 00:07:35.730
And then it can ultimately
connect to anything

00:07:35.730 --> 00:07:37.280
you can plug in for the trigger.

00:07:40.384 --> 00:07:41.800
TIMOTHY JORDAN:
All right, well, I

00:07:41.800 --> 00:07:43.090
was playing with this earlier.

00:07:43.090 --> 00:07:44.250
It was very cool.

00:07:44.250 --> 00:07:46.630
I was able to hit the
button and do a gesture.

00:07:46.630 --> 00:07:48.236
And then like
using that gesture,

00:07:48.236 --> 00:07:49.360
we could turn it off or on.

00:07:49.360 --> 00:07:50.590
That's awesome.

00:07:50.590 --> 00:07:52.820
So you wanted to say one
last thing about Quickdraw.

00:07:52.820 --> 00:07:53.903
SPEAKER 1: One last thing.

00:07:53.903 --> 00:07:55.940
We're very, very excited
today to announce

00:07:55.940 --> 00:08:00.270
that we're releasing, open
sourcing 50 million images.

00:08:00.270 --> 00:08:03.350
These are vector drawings
where the actual ordered

00:08:03.350 --> 00:08:07.240
draw strokes of images that
people have drawn in Quickdraw.

00:08:07.240 --> 00:08:09.540
It's available
now for developers

00:08:09.540 --> 00:08:12.040
to go and train their own models
on, which is very exciting.

00:08:12.040 --> 00:08:13.922
Researchers can go
in and look at it

00:08:13.922 --> 00:08:15.640
and find some
interesting patterns.

00:08:15.640 --> 00:08:18.160
And artists can go and do
interesting and weird things,

00:08:18.160 --> 00:08:21.310
and submit them back
to us as experiments.

00:08:21.310 --> 00:08:24.005
So we're very, very happy to
share this data with the world.

00:08:24.005 --> 00:08:24.890
TIMOTHY JORDAN: That's awesome.

00:08:24.890 --> 00:08:25.780
Thank you so much.

00:08:25.780 --> 00:08:28.926
And thank you for showing us
around the experiments tent.

00:08:28.926 --> 00:08:29.800
SPEAKER 1: Absoutely.

00:08:29.800 --> 00:08:32.500
Thanks, Timothy.

00:08:32.500 --> 00:08:34.309
TIMOTHY JORDAN: So
that was Experiments.

00:08:34.309 --> 00:08:36.110
Now, if you want to
see this video again,

00:08:36.110 --> 00:08:39.110
or you to see any of the other
videos or recording at the sand

00:08:39.110 --> 00:08:42.140
box areas here at
Google I/O 2017,

00:08:42.140 --> 00:08:45.800
head on over to g.co/io/guide.

00:08:45.800 --> 00:08:48.820
I'm Timothy Jordan, and I'll
see you at the next one.

00:08:48.820 --> 00:08:53.970
