1
00:00:06,200 --> 00:00:07,530
Like a boss

2
00:00:13,640 --> 00:00:13,750
[inaudible]

3
00:00:13,750 --> 00:00:16,990
you know, it's like the next
thing that was coming up was, uh,

4
00:00:17,050 --> 00:00:21,250
somebody up there likes me, which I'd
always heard of when I was growing up.

5
00:00:21,251 --> 00:00:23,350
And then once I saw it was Paul
Newman, I was like, all right,

6
00:00:23,351 --> 00:00:24,184
I'm going to watch it.

7
00:00:24,580 --> 00:00:28,360
And it was him playing out rocky
Graziano the rocky Graziano story.

8
00:00:28,810 --> 00:00:30,850
Oh boy. They just try to
fool you got to lousy Coptic.

9
00:00:30,900 --> 00:00:33,890
I'm gonna land my [inaudible], but I

10
00:00:35,810 --> 00:00:40,330
don't leave me alone. Leave me alone.
Why don't you give up on me? My

11
00:00:43,050 --> 00:00:46,240
[inaudible] will be everybody else
knows. Why don't you give up on me?

12
00:00:47,080 --> 00:00:51,860
And, um, and I literally forget what
I was talking. Oh, that's right.

13
00:00:51,861 --> 00:00:55,790
That's right. So it just got me on
this, this, this Paul Newman thing.

14
00:00:55,850 --> 00:01:00,410
And you know what's funny is,
uh, this, this thing, actually,

15
00:01:00,411 --> 00:01:03,680
Steve McQueen is in that
movie for fucking two seconds.

16
00:01:04,470 --> 00:01:08,020
Okay. What do you say? Fight out?

17
00:01:10,300 --> 00:01:12,270
Come on. Get on. Huh?

18
00:01:12,820 --> 00:01:17,140
And uh, it's right as, uh, Graziani
was getting out of some fucking, uh,

19
00:01:17,230 --> 00:01:20,200
you know, juvenile detention
home that he fucking escapes.

20
00:01:20,500 --> 00:01:22,930
So He's going around the
neighborhood, tapping all these guys,

21
00:01:22,931 --> 00:01:24,910
all this tough guy,
friends on the shoulders.

22
00:01:24,980 --> 00:01:29,690
Hey Shorty degree, come on
buddy boy, we got work to do.

23
00:01:35,820 --> 00:01:36,260
[inaudible]

24
00:01:36,260 --> 00:01:37,830
to be like, Hey I'm back
in the neighborhood.

25
00:01:37,910 --> 00:01:40,190
And all of them turn around like
who the fuck is this guy? Right?

26
00:01:40,191 --> 00:01:45,191
Cause cause it Tufts street
kids so fucking a fucking
Steve McQueen is shooting

27
00:01:47,601 --> 00:01:48,434
pool.

28
00:01:48,650 --> 00:01:52,070
The rocky taps him on the shoulder and
he fucking turns around with a knife out

29
00:01:52,071 --> 00:01:57,050
just two seconds and then he
realizes it's reads like it's rocky.

30
00:01:57,090 --> 00:01:58,970
He's like, hey rocky.

31
00:01:58,971 --> 00:02:03,971
And he does this stupid fucking thing
with his hand that I don't know who

32
00:02:04,371 --> 00:02:05,204
fucking,

33
00:02:06,860 --> 00:02:11,390
there's certain things in movies that
the first guy who plays that guy does and

34
00:02:11,391 --> 00:02:15,380
then it's this weird fucking thing
where every other actor after it starts

35
00:02:15,381 --> 00:02:18,950
fucking doing it and you
know, nobody ever did it.

36
00:02:19,010 --> 00:02:21,080
Who's actually the guy
that they're playing.

37
00:02:21,200 --> 00:02:24,860
But then it's done enough in fucking
movies that the people who are actually

38
00:02:24,861 --> 00:02:28,310
that guy, then they start fucking doing
it. And that's when it becomes a circle.

39
00:02:28,311 --> 00:02:30,900
And you don't know who the fuck it
is. It's this fucking thing like, uh,

40
00:02:31,460 --> 00:02:32,151
it's almost like,

41
00:02:32,151 --> 00:02:35,720
say you were getting a mannequin right
and you wanted to dry off your nails and

42
00:02:35,721 --> 00:02:40,280
you do just see exec a rocky and he's
doing this stupid fucking thing with his

43
00:02:40,281 --> 00:02:43,870
hand. Um, I dunno,

44
00:02:44,050 --> 00:02:46,330
I'm going a really long way here to
tell you what I really want to tell you.

45
00:02:46,331 --> 00:02:50,950
But like one of my favorite things is
to watch actors during that era playing

46
00:02:50,951 --> 00:02:54,880
Tufts street kids. Um, like it's just,

47
00:02:54,910 --> 00:02:59,580
it's fucking cringeworthy that fucking
movie that Marlon Brando did. Oh,

48
00:02:59,620 --> 00:03:02,440
he's on the motorcycle. What
the fuck was that one called?

49
00:03:03,070 --> 00:03:07,270
It's not the wild bunch. That was a
cowboy movie. Rebel without a cot.

50
00:03:07,490 --> 00:03:10,720
Now that's James Dean. I
can't remember, but just the,

51
00:03:10,810 --> 00:03:13,490
the have to sit there
and watch that shit. Um,

52
00:03:14,320 --> 00:03:18,130
how fucking brutal it
is that west side story,

53
00:03:18,400 --> 00:03:19,600
which I don't think I've ever seen.

54
00:03:19,601 --> 00:03:22,930
I'm just gonna throw that in there
cause I need three of them. Um,

55
00:03:28,720 --> 00:03:29,090
[inaudible]

56
00:03:29,090 --> 00:03:32,930
how can you ask me to go on a courthouse
building that happens to be what people

57
00:03:32,931 --> 00:03:36,290
get married? Well, being in courthouse
just makes me be uncomfortable.

58
00:03:36,291 --> 00:03:39,130
Stuff on the please. [inaudible]

59
00:03:39,820 --> 00:03:41,040
just tell me you don't love

60
00:03:55,570 --> 00:03:55,570
[inaudible].
