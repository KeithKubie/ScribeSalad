Speaker 1:          00:00          The Joe Rogan experience. No one one scared me more than anyone that I've ever read. I read about this thing that I'm, Darpa was putting together a robot called the eater robot, e a t our robot. It's a robot that fuels itself on a biological matter, so it essentially can eat bodies. So you've got a murderous robot that eats people. There is fuel was kind of things that human beings could achieve. It's like people are sat around Trynna yeah, come up with them. Well, they're the, you know, they, they're responsible for a lot of really crazy innovation in terms of like military stuff, you know, but Boston dynamics, you know, they're the ones that make those crazy robots and they work with Darpa and those are the ones that make those robots that you can't kick over. Right. You know? I mean, that's what you need one of those that eats people and you send them to the battlefield.

Speaker 1:          00:55          Kicky Anova. No, that was the first thing we established is you can't kick out over. I just think that's, that's the big fear is that future warfare will be our robots versus their robots. You know, if we're starting to bring about the worst aspects are the worst things that a human being can conceive of that channel them through into reality. Yeah. It does make you feel that there are pockets is real. I thought it was bad enough when in the malaise of my younger days, I see like a for a, wow. Imagine if there was a cleaning service where the person would come around and clean dressed scantily. They do that. They do that. Why have a devious shit? You can dream up. Someone's trying to turn a buck off it and they've taken it to the extent of the non kick over the robot. Fleshy in robots.

Speaker 1:          01:43          Yeah. Yeah. What is this? James is a new one. New video today. God, watch this. This is so scary. This is Boston dynamics. Yeah. There's something very eerie about that type of motion. You know that the way that the movement of a snake is deeply coded to be unpleasant when you see it. Let's talk about your thing that moved me. Think that ain't good for the truck. It's telling, wow. Oh my God, they're pulling a truck when he's tiny little Tutsis, those they're that strong to get pull a truck and a little robots. That's a giant ass truck. I mean, he's also just a Husky sled might have expensive robots and a truck. They've spent a lot of time and endeavor to go backwards, I guess kind of. But to an Asia Santa close, they're showing how strong these things are. I don't like, I don't like their gate, Joe.

Speaker 1:          02:29          That's an unpleasant gate. Yeah, you should be. You should be uncomfortable with it. Yeah, that's not, I'm not at ease with that. It's not good. It's not animal and there's no compassion in it. This is, it's, it's feeling lists, but that's what you got to worry about. If you've ever see that episode of black mirror or the lady gets chased down by the drones, I have nothing that will, they've won with a BS. No. There's a woman who's being haunted. She's being hunted by a robot and it's terrifying because if it's remorseless lack of humanity and empathy, just like that looks just like those things. Those are real. Charlie Brooker. He, yeah, he intubate. That man's got good. Imagine that. He's amazing. He's amazing. That show. It was fantastic, but these things, look, what we have to worry about is once artificial intelligence become sentient and you can somehow or another attachment to these objects that move and they run on solar power or they have you know, nuclear fuel cells or some crazy shit that allows them to exist for a long period of time.

Speaker 1:          03:27          Maybe you don't have to worry about them contaminating environments. If your plan of killing everybody in the environment, aw man, I know that there's no means of regulation. Is there because this, because this is the apex of human endeavor there in Wa. What can govern that? What can regulate it and like you say, there'll be a Chinese equivalent for any of this stuff. There's nothing that's above it guy and is this a good idea? Should we pull back? What did he do? He just pulled up a thing that said they're making that now you can cut that one I just showed you. They're good. Are a hundred different models of it are going to be available. Starting production this summer. Doesn't say how much they're going. Wow. But available for people to buy. Well it says a hundred different models has produced a hundred models. That probably means it'll produce a hundred of them.

Speaker 1:          04:11          Like a hundred different companies are going to want them. But I bet it's more than that. Yeah. Depending about how much they cost. It doesn't say how much it's gonna cost. They're going down to that later. But there's showed uh oh like a robot arm come. Although it looks so creepy. Look at that thing. Imagine we have one of those things in the room filming. We should get one. No, I'm taking notes. One day we come here, it's got red eyes and it's like, fuck you. Fuck you. What were the first ones to help it be friendly chat. Can they listen to us like Alexa? It begins, isn't it? There's something arachnoid and now that it's almost like you know, not your church and see if this tuned into their DMT component of what we've been talking about. It's almost as if we've already experienced to this reality.

Speaker 1:          04:52          We've already been through the version where those evil insectoid robots take over. So when we see on the screen and say, oh no, we're doing that thing, that thing where we create those things that bring about destruction. And I believe it's because we've become biased to commerce and a particular type of progress. But one narrative has succeeded because we necessarily have to throw off religion but you know, at the dawn of the secular age, because religion was becoming systems of bias and systems of oppression and what systems of a but what do I want to say? Elevate in certain types of power. One supporting it at least lets go hang on a minute. This religion, a lot of it seems like bullshit. What we've done is we've abandoned the sacred and I think if you abandon the sacred meaning there is more to life than what we can understand.

Speaker 1:          05:40          I listened to the Brian Cox episode enough, spoke to Brian Cox, the British physicist, astrophysicist on my show as well. And when he talks about like he said that, you know, we know that there's not some additional component to a human being because we can break down everything that happens when you move an arm, you know, whatever. And I feel like we only have limited, we only have limited instruments. There's certain frequencies that we simply cannot read. What else is going on when people are having these transcendent psychedelic experiences, we're accessing elements of consciousness, energies and frequencies that we are not able to access while we're in this state and everything were achieving and everything we're building, we're building on this platform and the bias of this platform is towards prior progress and materialism and I think the result is fleshy in robots and those evil monkey warrior.

Speaker 1:          06:25          So Jess and we might want to calm down. I have a little talk about what it is we're trying to design. Yeah. I don't know if I agree with Brian on that particular point that we think we know everything about where consciousness emanates. I don't think that's necessarily true, but I like the fact that he thinks that way because he's such a rigid, hard liner for science. And Yeah, we've got works at cern. I mean, he's a brilliant, brilliant man. So of course he thinks that way. I also don't think he's ever had a DMT experience. Yeah.
