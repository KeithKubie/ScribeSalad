00:00:00.200 --> 00:00:02.130
- [Instructor] Block A, with mass M,

00:00:02.130 --> 00:00:06.800
sits on top of block B,
with mass 2M in an elevator.

00:00:06.800 --> 00:00:10.060
The elevator is moving
downward and slowing down.

00:00:10.060 --> 00:00:11.910
All right, when we have
this diagram over here,

00:00:11.910 --> 00:00:15.130
it's moving downward and slowing down.

00:00:15.130 --> 00:00:18.380
So that means it's accelerating upwards.

00:00:18.380 --> 00:00:21.800
The magnitude of the
Earth's force of gravity

00:00:21.800 --> 00:00:26.800
on block A, is F sub G sub A.

00:00:27.150 --> 00:00:30.730
The force magnitude exerted
on block A by block B

00:00:30.730 --> 00:00:32.630
is F sub A.

00:00:32.630 --> 00:00:36.100
And the force magnitude
exerted on block B by block A

00:00:36.100 --> 00:00:37.500
is F sub B.

00:00:37.500 --> 00:00:40.370
How do the force magnitudes compare?

00:00:40.370 --> 00:00:42.010
This is fascinating.

00:00:42.010 --> 00:00:44.090
So pause this video and see
if you can figure it out

00:00:44.090 --> 00:00:44.923
on your own.

00:00:46.500 --> 00:00:48.880
All right, well let's just
draw a free-body diagram

00:00:48.880 --> 00:00:51.070
for block A.

00:00:51.070 --> 00:00:52.250
So,

00:00:52.250 --> 00:00:55.420
I have block A right over here.

00:00:55.420 --> 00:00:57.400
Now there's a couple of things we know.

00:00:57.400 --> 00:01:01.710
We know that this whole
system is moving downward

00:01:01.710 --> 00:01:04.010
and slowing down.

00:01:04.010 --> 00:01:04.990
And we know that 'cause it says

00:01:04.990 --> 00:01:07.420
the elevator is moving
downward and slowing down

00:01:07.420 --> 00:01:09.190
and block A is sitting on block B

00:01:09.190 --> 00:01:11.460
is sitting on the elevator.

00:01:11.460 --> 00:01:13.970
And so if you're moving
downward and slowing down,

00:01:13.970 --> 00:01:17.740
that means that your net
acceleration is upwards.

00:01:17.740 --> 00:01:22.270
Which tells you that
your net force on block A

00:01:22.270 --> 00:01:23.670
needs to be upwards.

00:01:23.670 --> 00:01:25.740
Which tells you if we have some forces

00:01:25.740 --> 00:01:27.140
that are acting upwards,

00:01:27.140 --> 00:01:29.460
the magnitude of those are gonna be larger

00:01:29.460 --> 00:01:32.750
than the forces acting downwards.

00:01:32.750 --> 00:01:34.470
So for block A,

00:01:34.470 --> 00:01:37.900
what are the forces that
are acting downwards on it?

00:01:37.900 --> 00:01:41.040
Well, the force of gravity
is acting on block A.

00:01:41.040 --> 00:01:42.620
And that's that right over there.

00:01:42.620 --> 00:01:47.080
That is, its magnitude
is capital F sub G sub A,

00:01:48.050 --> 00:01:52.630
and what's the upward
force acting on block A?

00:01:52.630 --> 00:01:54.530
Well, they say the force magnitude exerted

00:01:54.530 --> 00:01:57.730
on block A by block B is F sub A.

00:01:57.730 --> 00:02:01.840
So the magnitude here is F sub A.

00:02:01.840 --> 00:02:02.720
So we immediately know,

00:02:02.720 --> 00:02:05.080
because we have a net
acceleration upwards,

00:02:05.080 --> 00:02:07.400
remember, we're moving down
but we're slowing down.

00:02:07.400 --> 00:02:09.710
So it's a net acceleration upwards.

00:02:09.710 --> 00:02:11.350
That immediately tells us

00:02:11.350 --> 00:02:14.310
that the magnitude of F sub A

00:02:14.310 --> 00:02:16.810
is going to be greater than

00:02:16.810 --> 00:02:20.610
the magnitude of the
force of gravity on A.

00:02:20.610 --> 00:02:22.080
And so we can immediately,

00:02:22.080 --> 00:02:24.540
we can get rid of some of these choices.

00:02:24.540 --> 00:02:27.420
But they also are comparing F sub B here.

00:02:27.420 --> 00:02:31.120
So how can we involve F
sub B in this inequality?

00:02:31.120 --> 00:02:34.370
Well, the key here is
in Newton's Third Law.

00:02:34.370 --> 00:02:37.540
Whatever force B is exerting on A,

00:02:37.540 --> 00:02:40.790
and we know we call that F sub A,

00:02:40.790 --> 00:02:42.570
or it's magnitude is F sub A.

00:02:42.570 --> 00:02:44.530
A is going to exert
from Newton's Third Law

00:02:44.530 --> 00:02:47.090
and equal and opposite force on B.

00:02:47.090 --> 00:02:49.400
So this is going to be magnitude,

00:02:49.400 --> 00:02:50.620
the arrows are,

00:02:50.620 --> 00:02:52.520
this arrow points downward,

00:02:52.520 --> 00:02:54.550
but it's gonna have the same magnitude.

00:02:54.550 --> 00:02:55.950
F sub B.

00:02:55.950 --> 00:02:59.730
So the magnitude of these
two forces are the same.

00:02:59.730 --> 00:03:01.410
So another way to think about it is

00:03:01.410 --> 00:03:04.890
F sub A is equal to F sub B

00:03:04.890 --> 00:03:06.390
by Newton's Third Law.

00:03:06.390 --> 00:03:10.050
And since we know that the whole system

00:03:10.050 --> 00:03:11.820
is accelerating upwards,

00:03:11.820 --> 00:03:14.300
it's moving downwards
but it's slowing down,

00:03:14.300 --> 00:03:16.480
we know that this thing is going to be

00:03:16.480 --> 00:03:19.630
greater than the force of gravity on A.

00:03:19.630 --> 00:03:22.943
And we see that that is
choice B, and we're done.
