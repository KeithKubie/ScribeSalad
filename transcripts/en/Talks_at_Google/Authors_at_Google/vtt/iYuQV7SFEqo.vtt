00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.820
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:00:06.110 --> 00:00:08.790
SPEAKER: Good
afternoon, everybody.

00:00:08.790 --> 00:00:12.050
I'm here to welcome Jeffrey
Kluger to the [INAUDIBLE]

00:00:12.050 --> 00:00:15.020
TechTalks stream at Google.

00:00:15.020 --> 00:00:17.360
Jeffrey Kluger is the
author of several books.

00:00:17.360 --> 00:00:20.840
In addition to "Apollo 8,"
which he is here to talk about,

00:00:20.840 --> 00:00:23.330
he also authored "Apollo 13."

00:00:23.330 --> 00:00:24.200
This was awhile ago.

00:00:24.200 --> 00:00:25.732
It was published as "Lost Moon."

00:00:25.732 --> 00:00:28.190
And he's also published books
on a rather different subject

00:00:28.190 --> 00:00:29.840
called the sibling effect.

00:00:29.840 --> 00:00:32.060
He's a science writer and
a senior editor for Time.

00:00:32.060 --> 00:00:34.700
He's been there for quite
a while, two decades.

00:00:34.700 --> 00:00:37.280
And he's written more than 40
cover stories for that magazine

00:00:37.280 --> 00:00:38.900
over that time.

00:00:38.900 --> 00:00:40.370
He lives in New York City.

00:00:40.370 --> 00:00:42.740
So therefore, please
welcome Jeffrey

00:00:42.740 --> 00:00:44.250
to Google in Los Angeles.

00:00:53.264 --> 00:00:54.680
JEFFREY KLUGER:
Thank you so much.

00:00:54.680 --> 00:00:56.300
Thank you for having me here.

00:00:56.300 --> 00:01:01.840
I was mentioning to Alex
that just before he came up

00:01:01.840 --> 00:01:04.209
on stage, I took a
picture of this room

00:01:04.209 --> 00:01:06.970
to send to my 14 and
16-year-old daughters,

00:01:06.970 --> 00:01:10.720
because being at Google,
that will impress them.

00:01:10.720 --> 00:01:14.380
Nothing else I do impresses
them, but that will.

00:01:14.380 --> 00:01:20.800
So I want to talk a bit
about the history of Apollo 8

00:01:20.800 --> 00:01:25.510
and the historical
significance of Apollo 8.

00:01:25.510 --> 00:01:30.230
And I hope you'll forgive me
if I glance down quite a bit

00:01:30.230 --> 00:01:32.950
and do as much
reading as speaking.

00:01:32.950 --> 00:01:38.050
Extemporaneously, I am
a shameless wind bag,

00:01:38.050 --> 00:01:39.610
so when I write
things down, they

00:01:39.610 --> 00:01:42.070
tend to be unmemorizable,
because they're just

00:01:42.070 --> 00:01:43.660
too damn long.

00:01:43.660 --> 00:01:50.950
So I'll be a little less formal
in our Q&amp;A that will follow.

00:01:50.950 --> 00:01:56.260
And the point I like to start by
making when I talk about Apollo

00:01:56.260 --> 00:02:02.320
8 is that if there was one thing
clear to the people of NASA

00:02:02.320 --> 00:02:05.920
in the summer of 1968,
it was that America

00:02:05.920 --> 00:02:11.170
had no business going anywhere
near the moon that year,

00:02:11.170 --> 00:02:13.420
at least not for a long while.

00:02:13.420 --> 00:02:16.090
Actually, it was clear to
anyone outside of NASA,

00:02:16.090 --> 00:02:19.780
as well, or at least
anyone who had any sense.

00:02:19.780 --> 00:02:21.730
Yes, the country
had been eyeballing

00:02:21.730 --> 00:02:24.220
the moon for a long time now.

00:02:24.220 --> 00:02:27.760
In 1961, President
Kennedy had promised

00:02:27.760 --> 00:02:31.030
that a landing would
happen before 1970

00:02:31.030 --> 00:02:35.230
and before the Soviets could
manage such a feat, as well.

00:02:35.230 --> 00:02:38.650
The Congress and the public
and the new president

00:02:38.650 --> 00:02:41.530
after Kennedy's murder
had believed him,

00:02:41.530 --> 00:02:44.320
and so the space
race was joined.

00:02:44.320 --> 00:02:50.410
Now there were just 16 months
to go before the 1960s expired,

00:02:50.410 --> 00:02:52.900
and only a fool would
believe that America

00:02:52.900 --> 00:02:57.790
could stick a lunar landing in
the time that was remaining.

00:02:57.790 --> 00:03:01.840
Just the year before, astronauts
Gus Grissom, Ed White,

00:03:01.840 --> 00:03:06.400
and Roger Chaffee had died
in a launch pad fire locked

00:03:06.400 --> 00:03:09.490
inside the Apollo space
craft that they were supposed

00:03:09.490 --> 00:03:13.600
to take for its first test
flight in low-Earth orbit

00:03:13.600 --> 00:03:16.600
and that later crews
were supposed to entrust

00:03:16.600 --> 00:03:19.390
to take them out to the moon.

00:03:19.390 --> 00:03:23.050
Everyone had known that
the Apollo was a jalopy,

00:03:23.050 --> 00:03:26.770
but the clock was ticking,
and the Russians were lurking,

00:03:26.770 --> 00:03:30.160
and there was nothing NASA
could do but throw together

00:03:30.160 --> 00:03:35.410
the best spacecraft they could
and hope it was flight worthy.

00:03:35.410 --> 00:03:38.410
Instead, that great
moon ship ended up

00:03:38.410 --> 00:03:40.690
with three deaths
on its rap sheet

00:03:40.690 --> 00:03:43.520
before it ever got
off the ground.

00:03:43.520 --> 00:03:45.220
So the order went
out that it was

00:03:45.220 --> 00:03:48.100
to be stripped down
to its floor studs

00:03:48.100 --> 00:03:52.060
and designed all over again,
a job that could easily

00:03:52.060 --> 00:03:54.980
take well more than a year.

00:03:54.980 --> 00:03:58.960
Meantime, the lunar module, the
buggy, four-legged contraption

00:03:58.960 --> 00:04:02.560
that was designed to ferry two
of the three astronauts down

00:04:02.560 --> 00:04:05.920
from lunar orbit onto
the surface of the moon,

00:04:05.920 --> 00:04:09.790
had arrived at Cape
Canaveral entirely unsuited

00:04:09.790 --> 00:04:12.010
for the job it was
supposed to do.

00:04:12.010 --> 00:04:14.380
It was too heavy,
and frankly, too

00:04:14.380 --> 00:04:18.190
flat out stupid to fly in
space with the software

00:04:18.190 --> 00:04:22.019
in its computerized brain
forever getting overloaded

00:04:22.019 --> 00:04:25.690
or breaking down entirely.

00:04:25.690 --> 00:04:30.460
And as for the Saturn 5 moon
rocket, the massive 36 story

00:04:30.460 --> 00:04:35.170
machine on which the entire
lunar enterprise depended,

00:04:35.170 --> 00:04:38.500
it had just two
unmanned flights so far.

00:04:38.500 --> 00:04:42.040
And the second time, just
four months earlier, in April,

00:04:42.040 --> 00:04:46.720
1968, it had vibrated so
violently on the way up

00:04:46.720 --> 00:04:50.320
to space that it nearly
shook itself apart.

00:04:50.320 --> 00:04:52.360
And the astronauts
aboard the thing

00:04:52.360 --> 00:04:56.400
would have gone
to pieces with it.

00:04:56.400 --> 00:04:59.550
The miserable state of
the American space program

00:04:59.550 --> 00:05:04.260
seemed perfectly in keeping
with the miserable state of 1968

00:05:04.260 --> 00:05:07.860
itself, a blood soaked
year that included

00:05:07.860 --> 00:05:13.770
the assassinations of Bobby
Kennedy and Martin Luther King,

00:05:13.770 --> 00:05:17.670
the Tet Offensive in Vietnam,
and the Soviet invasion

00:05:17.670 --> 00:05:23.400
of Czechoslovakia, as well as
riots in Paris, Mexico City,

00:05:23.400 --> 00:05:26.190
the Democratic
Convention in Chicago,

00:05:26.190 --> 00:05:29.130
and in dozens of
American cities.

00:05:29.130 --> 00:05:33.360
The great transcendent
triumph of a moon landing,

00:05:33.360 --> 00:05:36.150
if it occurred at
all, was destined

00:05:36.150 --> 00:05:41.130
to happen until not
some time in the 1970s.

00:05:41.130 --> 00:05:46.740
And then, in August
of 1968, George Lowe,

00:05:46.740 --> 00:05:49.740
the director of the
Apollo program office,

00:05:49.740 --> 00:05:53.520
had a wonderfully unhinged idea.

00:05:53.520 --> 00:05:56.310
He asked Chris Craft
and Bob Gilreath,

00:05:56.310 --> 00:05:59.490
NASA officials who
outranked him in seniority,

00:05:59.490 --> 00:06:04.020
if not, in inspiration,
to come to his office.

00:06:04.020 --> 00:06:08.070
When they arrived, he closed
the door, and he sat them down,

00:06:08.070 --> 00:06:12.260
and he said, in effect,
you know our schedule?

00:06:12.260 --> 00:06:14.490
Let's screw our schedule.

00:06:14.490 --> 00:06:17.730
Let's go to the
moon in 16 weeks,

00:06:17.730 --> 00:06:20.850
and let's give the
assignment to Apollo 8,

00:06:20.850 --> 00:06:24.310
because Apollo 8
can do that job.

00:06:24.310 --> 00:06:28.970
And with that,
everything changed.

00:06:28.970 --> 00:06:34.310
If Apollo 8 could make it to
the moon by Christmas week 1968,

00:06:34.310 --> 00:06:36.320
it was going to be
much more than just

00:06:36.320 --> 00:06:39.320
a political or
technical achievement.

00:06:39.320 --> 00:06:44.120
It would be a threshold moment
for the species as a whole.

00:06:44.120 --> 00:06:48.680
Human beings had spent nearly
the entirety of our existence

00:06:48.680 --> 00:06:53.060
as low terrestrial
creatures, ground dwellers

00:06:53.060 --> 00:06:58.070
forever trapped at the bottom of
the planet's deep gravity well.

00:06:58.070 --> 00:07:01.820
In the previous century, we had
managed to haul ourselves out

00:07:01.820 --> 00:07:05.180
of the dirt a little bit,
inventing machines that

00:07:05.180 --> 00:07:07.580
could carry us through
the atmosphere,

00:07:07.580 --> 00:07:11.390
and later, even above it,
orbiting around and around

00:07:11.390 --> 00:07:17.280
the planet in a near-earth
zone we dared to call space.

00:07:17.280 --> 00:07:21.500
But that space was, on
average, no more than 150 miles

00:07:21.500 --> 00:07:24.020
off the ground, a little
more than the distance

00:07:24.020 --> 00:07:27.680
between Washington
and Philadelphia.

00:07:27.680 --> 00:07:31.080
Apollo 8 would break that
gravitational strangle

00:07:31.080 --> 00:07:32.750
hold at last.

00:07:32.750 --> 00:07:36.200
The astronauts would tear
themselves away from the Earth,

00:07:36.200 --> 00:07:40.190
sail into the deep
waters of deep space,

00:07:40.190 --> 00:07:43.670
journey nearly a quarter
of a million miles,

00:07:43.670 --> 00:07:48.710
and then enter the gravity field
of an entirely different body.

00:07:48.710 --> 00:07:50.960
Apollo 8 would not
land on the moon.

00:07:50.960 --> 00:07:52.640
That would be for
a later mission

00:07:52.640 --> 00:07:55.790
when the lunar module
was at last ready,

00:07:55.790 --> 00:07:57.800
but it hardly mattered.

00:07:57.800 --> 00:08:01.010
When this mission
was done, homosapiens

00:08:01.010 --> 00:08:04.790
would be transformed from
a species of one world

00:08:04.790 --> 00:08:07.610
to a species of two worlds.

00:08:07.610 --> 00:08:10.940
There were a couple of
ways to achieve that goal.

00:08:10.940 --> 00:08:14.600
The Apollo 8 astronauts could
fly either a circumlunar

00:08:14.600 --> 00:08:17.390
mission, whipping around
the back of the moon

00:08:17.390 --> 00:08:19.700
and coming straight
home, or they

00:08:19.700 --> 00:08:23.300
could fly a longer orbital
orbital mission, circling

00:08:23.300 --> 00:08:25.850
the moon a full 10 times.

00:08:25.850 --> 00:08:28.700
By any measure,
the orbital mission

00:08:28.700 --> 00:08:31.580
would be more dangerous.

00:08:31.580 --> 00:08:34.429
A circumlunar flight was
something of a freebie

00:08:34.429 --> 00:08:36.530
when it came to the physics.

00:08:36.530 --> 00:08:40.010
Get close enough to the moon
on your outward bound journey,

00:08:40.010 --> 00:08:43.580
and the lunar gravity would
grab hold of your spacecraft,

00:08:43.580 --> 00:08:48.440
send it on a low flying arc
over the moon's far side,

00:08:48.440 --> 00:08:51.190
and then fling it home
like an around the horn

00:08:51.190 --> 00:08:54.020
toss from shortstop to first.

00:08:54.020 --> 00:08:56.990
The engineers called it
a free return trajectory,

00:08:56.990 --> 00:08:59.470
and that nicely captured it.

00:08:59.470 --> 00:09:03.590
A lunar orbital mission would
be a whole different beast.

00:09:03.590 --> 00:09:06.860
It would require the astronauts
to fire the main engine

00:09:06.860 --> 00:09:09.200
at the back of their
spacecraft at least

00:09:09.200 --> 00:09:12.920
twice, once to slow them down
enough so that they would

00:09:12.920 --> 00:09:16.760
be captured by lunar
gravity and enter orbit

00:09:16.760 --> 00:09:18.890
and once more to
speed the ship up

00:09:18.890 --> 00:09:21.950
again so that they could
break free of the orbit

00:09:21.950 --> 00:09:24.560
and come home.

00:09:24.560 --> 00:09:26.720
The Apollo spacecraft's
engine, which

00:09:26.720 --> 00:09:29.900
is the red bell at the
bottom of the ship,

00:09:29.900 --> 00:09:33.020
was a big, roaring
blunderbuss thing,

00:09:33.020 --> 00:09:35.480
and it was built
for reliability.

00:09:35.480 --> 00:09:39.440
But reliable isn't perfect,
and what if it failed?

00:09:39.440 --> 00:09:41.000
That was the rub.

00:09:41.000 --> 00:09:43.910
If it fired once and
got you into orbit,

00:09:43.910 --> 00:09:46.730
and then failed a
second time, that

00:09:46.730 --> 00:09:50.210
would mean something much
worse than the mere death

00:09:50.210 --> 00:09:52.610
of three very good men.

00:09:52.610 --> 00:09:55.520
In that case,
those very good men

00:09:55.520 --> 00:09:59.150
would be trapped,
eternally circling the moon

00:09:59.150 --> 00:10:01.400
as the moon circled the Earth.

00:10:01.400 --> 00:10:04.430
Around and around,
forever and ever,

00:10:04.430 --> 00:10:09.740
sealed inside a $100 million
sarcophagus that would never

00:10:09.740 --> 00:10:13.730
come home, but never just
crash into the lunar surface

00:10:13.730 --> 00:10:16.490
and have done with it either.

00:10:16.490 --> 00:10:20.960
The moon, as one of the
astronauts' wives darkly noted,

00:10:20.960 --> 00:10:23.510
would be ruined for everyone.

00:10:23.510 --> 00:10:26.180
No one could ever look
at it again and not

00:10:26.180 --> 00:10:29.930
think of the three dead men.

00:10:29.930 --> 00:10:33.230
That ghoulish scenario
argued compellingly

00:10:33.230 --> 00:10:37.280
for playing it safe and
flying circumlunar, especially

00:10:37.280 --> 00:10:42.200
after the 1967 launch pad fire
that made the wages of hubris

00:10:42.200 --> 00:10:44.480
so lethally clear.

00:10:44.480 --> 00:10:46.370
But there were
other things arguing

00:10:46.370 --> 00:10:47.960
for a more ambitious mission.

00:10:52.010 --> 00:10:55.280
Future Apollo crews would
have to orbit the moon anyway

00:10:55.280 --> 00:10:56.180
before landing.

00:10:56.180 --> 00:10:58.070
And if you couldn't
trust your main engine

00:10:58.070 --> 00:11:00.230
to do the job it
was supposed to do,

00:11:00.230 --> 00:11:03.720
then you never should have
built it in the first place.

00:11:03.720 --> 00:11:06.050
An orbital mission would
also allow the crew

00:11:06.050 --> 00:11:08.750
to conduct the photographic
reconnaissance that

00:11:08.750 --> 00:11:12.440
was necessary to look
for smooth, safe landing

00:11:12.440 --> 00:11:14.960
sites for later crews.

00:11:14.960 --> 00:11:19.340
So the decision was made that
Apollo 8 would go into orbit,

00:11:19.340 --> 00:11:24.260
despite the fact that it was
the harder, scarier, riskier

00:11:24.260 --> 00:11:25.580
thing to do.

00:11:25.580 --> 00:11:27.780
Because in addition to
all of those things,

00:11:27.780 --> 00:11:29.720
it was the right thing to do.

00:11:32.250 --> 00:11:35.700
Atlas rockets had been the
scarier, riskier choice

00:11:35.700 --> 00:11:38.220
for launching the first
Americans to earth orbit

00:11:38.220 --> 00:11:42.180
too, because the things were
exceedingly temperamental

00:11:42.180 --> 00:11:46.740
and had a troubling tendency
to explode on the way up.

00:11:46.740 --> 00:11:49.530
But the light weight and
the high speed of the Atlas

00:11:49.530 --> 00:11:51.960
also made it the right booster.

00:11:51.960 --> 00:11:54.480
So the people of
NASA just made sure

00:11:54.480 --> 00:11:57.690
that things worked the
way they were supposed to.

00:11:57.690 --> 00:12:00.570
In the same way, an
Apollo 10 lunar orbit

00:12:00.570 --> 00:12:03.180
was precisely the
right mission needed

00:12:03.180 --> 00:12:07.620
at precisely the right moment
in exploratory history.

00:12:07.620 --> 00:12:12.500
And so the decision was
made that it would be flown.

00:12:12.500 --> 00:12:18.050
Only 16 weeks after George
Lowe had his wild idea,

00:12:18.050 --> 00:12:23.600
at 5:11 AM on December
21, 1968, three days

00:12:23.600 --> 00:12:27.770
before Christmas Eve, veteran
astronauts Frank Borman,

00:12:27.770 --> 00:12:31.810
Jim Lovell, and Bill Landers
climbed into their Apollo

00:12:31.810 --> 00:12:37.210
spacecraft at the top
of the 363 foot tower

00:12:37.210 --> 00:12:42.070
that was the Saturn 5 and
prepared for a 7:51 AM

00:12:42.070 --> 00:12:44.690
liftoff for the moon.

00:12:44.690 --> 00:12:46.730
The redesigned
Apollo spacecraft had

00:12:46.730 --> 00:12:51.770
been certified fit for flight,
as had the Saturn 5 rocket.

00:12:51.770 --> 00:12:55.850
Werner Von Braun, the
German genius and ex-pat

00:12:55.850 --> 00:12:59.370
who had designed the V2
missiles that reigned terror

00:12:59.370 --> 00:13:02.810
on London during World War
II and was now involved

00:13:02.810 --> 00:13:07.430
in the more peaceable business
of designing rockets for NASA,

00:13:07.430 --> 00:13:09.830
assured his bosses
that vibration

00:13:09.830 --> 00:13:12.170
dampers he had
added to the rocket

00:13:12.170 --> 00:13:15.200
since its disastrous
April launch would

00:13:15.200 --> 00:13:18.110
ensure a smooth ride to space.

00:13:18.110 --> 00:13:21.680
Still, the astronauts who
were staking their lives

00:13:21.680 --> 00:13:27.110
on Von Braun's word not
impervious to worry.

00:13:27.110 --> 00:13:30.470
Jim Lovell was assigned to
the spacecraft's center seat,

00:13:30.470 --> 00:13:31.730
because the hatch--

00:13:31.730 --> 00:13:34.430
with a hatch directly
over his head.

00:13:34.430 --> 00:13:37.700
That meant he would enter
the cockpit last with Borman

00:13:37.700 --> 00:13:41.180
climbing in first to the left
hand seat and then Anders

00:13:41.180 --> 00:13:42.830
into to the right hand seat.

00:13:42.830 --> 00:13:45.410
And that, in turn,
gave Lovell a moment

00:13:45.410 --> 00:13:48.440
alone on the
scaffold-like gantry

00:13:48.440 --> 00:13:51.290
at the top of the rocket,
waiting for his crewmates

00:13:51.290 --> 00:13:54.020
to settle into position.

00:13:54.020 --> 00:13:57.170
He looked down at
the far below ground

00:13:57.170 --> 00:14:01.160
and noticed for the first
time the hundreds of thousands

00:14:01.160 --> 00:14:04.340
of people and the tens
of thousands of cars

00:14:04.340 --> 00:14:07.040
gathered to watch the liftoff.

00:14:07.040 --> 00:14:12.170
He also noticed that not a
single one of those spectators

00:14:12.170 --> 00:14:17.390
was allowed within a mile and
a half radius of the rocket.

00:14:17.390 --> 00:14:21.230
A circular no go
footprint had been

00:14:21.230 --> 00:14:25.190
stamped around the massive
violent machine that

00:14:25.190 --> 00:14:27.770
was the center of
so much attention,

00:14:27.770 --> 00:14:31.970
and the crew of Apollo 8 was
perched directly on top of it.

00:14:31.970 --> 00:14:36.740
Lovell thought, maybe they
know something we don't.

00:14:36.740 --> 00:14:40.280
He was joking
mostly, and then he

00:14:40.280 --> 00:14:43.130
made his way into the cockpit.

00:14:43.130 --> 00:14:46.640
Such mordant thoughts
notwithstanding, The Saturn

00:14:46.640 --> 00:14:48.040
did its job.

00:14:48.040 --> 00:14:52.490
Its five first stage engines
lit precisely on time,

00:14:52.490 --> 00:14:55.430
producing the loudest
sound generated

00:14:55.430 --> 00:15:00.260
by any human contrivance
apart from a nuclear bomb

00:15:00.260 --> 00:15:03.350
and radiating shock
waves that were detected

00:15:03.350 --> 00:15:08.390
on seismographs as far north as
Columbia University in New York

00:15:08.390 --> 00:15:09.770
City.

00:15:09.770 --> 00:15:13.790
Less than 12 minutes later,
the crew is in Earth orbit.

00:15:13.790 --> 00:15:16.400
And less than three
hours after that,

00:15:16.400 --> 00:15:20.120
they had lit the upper
stage engine of the Saturn 5

00:15:20.120 --> 00:15:24.830
once more and peeled
off for the moon.

00:15:24.830 --> 00:15:29.180
Slowly then, over the
course of the next few days,

00:15:29.180 --> 00:15:33.350
the world began to turn its
focus toward the mission.

00:15:33.350 --> 00:15:37.580
It was a world bleeding
from 1,000 wounds, wounds

00:15:37.580 --> 00:15:40.310
that in some ways
were shared by all

00:15:40.310 --> 00:15:45.440
of the 3.5 billion
people living in the 163

00:15:45.440 --> 00:15:51.530
sovereign states on the 4.5
billion year old planet.

00:15:51.530 --> 00:15:55.550
The people spoke 6,500
different languages,

00:15:55.550 --> 00:15:59.930
representing tens of thousands
of different cultures produced

00:15:59.930 --> 00:16:03.080
by uncountable
different histories.

00:16:03.080 --> 00:16:05.960
And yet, on that
day, they all began

00:16:05.960 --> 00:16:10.670
to attend to the very same
unlikely thing, the three

00:16:10.670 --> 00:16:15.410
American men with lunch bucket
names like Frank and Jim

00:16:15.410 --> 00:16:20.990
and Bill sealed inside a pod
of the spacecraft speeding away

00:16:20.990 --> 00:16:25.310
from the home planet
at an unheard of 25,000

00:16:25.310 --> 00:16:26.390
miles per hour.

00:16:29.370 --> 00:16:33.590
The day after the launch, when
the men were 120,000 miles away

00:16:33.590 --> 00:16:34.640
from Earth--

00:16:34.640 --> 00:16:37.400
still barely
halfway to the moon,

00:16:37.400 --> 00:16:43.670
but already 120 times
farther away from home

00:16:43.670 --> 00:16:47.180
than even the highest
flying other astronauts

00:16:47.180 --> 00:16:48.860
had ever been--

00:16:48.860 --> 00:16:51.320
they turned their
spacecraft back around

00:16:51.320 --> 00:16:55.700
to face their receding world and
pointed their television camera

00:16:55.700 --> 00:16:57.350
out the window.

00:16:57.350 --> 00:17:00.530
They took a bead
and switched it on

00:17:00.530 --> 00:17:02.600
and invited the
rest of the species

00:17:02.600 --> 00:17:07.339
to see the home planet
as they were seeing it.

00:17:07.339 --> 00:17:09.859
American astronauts
and Soviet cosmonauts

00:17:09.859 --> 00:17:13.099
had seen earth from
space many times before.

00:17:13.099 --> 00:17:16.310
But in those cases, they
had been dog paddling

00:17:16.310 --> 00:17:21.530
in orbit with the horizon of the
planet a mere arc beneath them,

00:17:21.530 --> 00:17:24.349
not entirely unlike the way
it appears from the window

00:17:24.349 --> 00:17:27.109
of a passenger jet.

00:17:27.109 --> 00:17:29.300
Now Borrman, Lovell,
and Anders were

00:17:29.300 --> 00:17:35.660
seeing the planet hanging alone,
unsupported, naked in space.

00:17:35.660 --> 00:17:38.530
The earth was no longer
the soil beneath their feet

00:17:38.530 --> 00:17:41.390
or the horizon below
their space craft,

00:17:41.390 --> 00:17:45.890
but a complete disk of light
suspended in front of them,

00:17:45.890 --> 00:17:48.890
a delicate Christmas
tree ornament made

00:17:48.890 --> 00:17:53.000
of swirls and swirls of
blue and white glass.

00:17:53.000 --> 00:17:57.470
It looked impossibly
beautiful, impossibly fragile,

00:17:57.470 --> 00:18:00.170
and impossibly breakable.

00:18:00.170 --> 00:18:02.420
The image on the
TV screens at home

00:18:02.420 --> 00:18:05.180
was nothing like
the brilliant vision

00:18:05.180 --> 00:18:07.130
the astronauts were seeing.

00:18:07.130 --> 00:18:09.950
It was grainy, black
and white, and filled

00:18:09.950 --> 00:18:12.110
with flickering static.

00:18:12.110 --> 00:18:16.100
But the people living on that
world tuned in all the same,

00:18:16.100 --> 00:18:20.000
by the hundreds of
millions, in fact.

00:18:20.000 --> 00:18:22.340
And what their TV screens
couldn't show them

00:18:22.340 --> 00:18:25.160
their imaginations filled in.

00:18:25.160 --> 00:18:26.960
They watched it in Britain.

00:18:26.960 --> 00:18:28.910
They watched it in France.

00:18:28.910 --> 00:18:31.160
They watched it in
Holland, where even

00:18:31.160 --> 00:18:36.470
the radio stations that usually
broadcast only classical music

00:18:36.470 --> 00:18:39.890
suspended or interrupted
their programming

00:18:39.890 --> 00:18:43.250
to carry regular updates
from the mission.

00:18:43.250 --> 00:18:46.760
Iran's state controlled
television network covered

00:18:46.760 --> 00:18:49.220
the story steadily and live.

00:18:49.220 --> 00:18:53.930
Tehran's radio station
covered nothing but the story.

00:18:53.930 --> 00:18:58.640
It was watched, too, in Central
America and South America

00:18:58.640 --> 00:19:02.600
and Japan and Taiwan
and South Korea

00:19:02.600 --> 00:19:07.070
and throughout much of the war
zone that was Southeast Asia.

00:19:07.070 --> 00:19:10.940
It was watched in Africa and
Australia and New Zealand

00:19:10.940 --> 00:19:15.110
and India and Turkey
and the Philippines.

00:19:15.110 --> 00:19:17.960
And all of that
was before Apollo 8

00:19:17.960 --> 00:19:20.150
had even reached the moon.

00:19:20.150 --> 00:19:24.800
As the next two days unfolded
and as Christmas Eve arrived,

00:19:24.800 --> 00:19:27.740
the Apollo 8 crew
at last sailed into

00:19:27.740 --> 00:19:31.700
the gravitational influence
of the unlikely place

00:19:31.700 --> 00:19:36.320
their nation and their
species had sent them.

00:19:36.320 --> 00:19:41.300
Having traveled more than
230,000 miles since they

00:19:41.300 --> 00:19:45.450
left the coast of Florida
just three days earlier,

00:19:45.450 --> 00:19:49.010
they would now skim over
the Western limb of the moon

00:19:49.010 --> 00:19:53.540
at an altitude of just 60
miles or a margin of error

00:19:53.540 --> 00:19:59.450
of just 0.0251%
compared to the distance

00:19:59.450 --> 00:20:02.000
they'd traveled so far.

00:20:02.000 --> 00:20:04.400
Only when they had whipped
around the far side

00:20:04.400 --> 00:20:08.480
of the moon, with radio
communications completely cut

00:20:08.480 --> 00:20:11.570
off by the intervening
lunar bulk,

00:20:11.570 --> 00:20:15.800
would they fire their
engine to settle into orbit.

00:20:15.800 --> 00:20:19.130
It would be one of the most
consequential maneuvers

00:20:19.130 --> 00:20:21.710
in the history of
human aviation,

00:20:21.710 --> 00:20:24.770
and the three men would
be completely alone

00:20:24.770 --> 00:20:27.110
when they executed it.

00:20:27.110 --> 00:20:29.180
The capsule
communicator in Houston

00:20:29.180 --> 00:20:31.640
called up to the spacecraft.

00:20:31.640 --> 00:20:34.680
Safe journey, guys, he said.

00:20:34.680 --> 00:20:38.300
Borman answered,
thanks a lot, troops.

00:20:38.300 --> 00:20:42.560
Houston answered, we'll
see you on the other side.

00:20:42.560 --> 00:20:47.890
And at that moment, the precise
second NASA had calculated,

00:20:47.890 --> 00:20:51.890
the communications line was cut.

00:20:51.890 --> 00:20:54.680
Alone on the far
side of the moon,

00:20:54.680 --> 00:20:56.990
the astronauts were
flying backwards

00:20:56.990 --> 00:20:59.660
and with their
windows facing upward

00:20:59.660 --> 00:21:02.540
so that while their radar
system told them that the lunar

00:21:02.540 --> 00:21:06.140
surface was barely five
dozen miles beneath them,

00:21:06.140 --> 00:21:09.110
they could not see
that for themselves.

00:21:09.110 --> 00:21:12.620
Soon enough, however, the
ship had backed far enough

00:21:12.620 --> 00:21:15.150
over the leading
edge of the moon

00:21:15.150 --> 00:21:18.260
that a small bit of the
ancient gray surface

00:21:18.260 --> 00:21:22.490
stretched in front of them just
visible through the backward

00:21:22.490 --> 00:21:23.300
facing windows.

00:21:25.910 --> 00:21:31.490
It was a huge, ruined, meteor
blasted beach stretching out

00:21:31.490 --> 00:21:35.960
to the right and left in a
changeless, gray-white expanse

00:21:35.960 --> 00:21:39.790
that didn't stop until it
spilled over the horizon.

00:21:39.790 --> 00:21:45.230
Lovell saw it first and
cried out simply, hey,

00:21:45.230 --> 00:21:47.060
I've got the moon.

00:21:47.060 --> 00:21:49.760
The other two men
sprang to their windows,

00:21:49.760 --> 00:21:53.940
peered through them,
and fell silent.

00:21:53.940 --> 00:21:59.410
More than 4 billion years
earlier, a passing planetesimal

00:21:59.410 --> 00:22:02.100
had collided with
the infant Earth,

00:22:02.100 --> 00:22:05.070
knocking it to the
cockeyed 23 degree

00:22:05.070 --> 00:22:08.220
angle that would one
day give us our seasons

00:22:08.220 --> 00:22:12.360
and sending up a great debris
cloud that, for a short time,

00:22:12.360 --> 00:22:14.220
formed a ring.

00:22:14.220 --> 00:22:17.460
Eventually, the ring
coalesced into a moon.

00:22:17.460 --> 00:22:21.210
That new satellite would soon
become gravitationally locked

00:22:21.210 --> 00:22:23.790
to the Earth, meaning
that it would always

00:22:23.790 --> 00:22:27.420
keep one side facing
its parent planet

00:22:27.420 --> 00:22:30.690
and the other side
pointing out to space.

00:22:30.690 --> 00:22:36.450
Less than a billion years later,
the first one-celled organisms

00:22:36.450 --> 00:22:38.460
appeared on Earth.

00:22:38.460 --> 00:22:41.370
It would be another 2
and 1/2 billion years

00:22:41.370 --> 00:22:43.750
before multicelled organisms.

00:22:43.750 --> 00:22:46.770
Some with rudimentary,
light-sensitive eyes

00:22:46.770 --> 00:22:48.930
spots followed.

00:22:48.930 --> 00:22:51.810
And on dark nights,
those spots possibly

00:22:51.810 --> 00:22:54.330
registered the
photons pouring down

00:22:54.330 --> 00:22:56.340
from the brightly lit moon.

00:22:56.340 --> 00:23:00.270
Later, other organisms
with better eyes--

00:23:00.270 --> 00:23:04.620
and in one case, with a big
brain and opposable thumbs

00:23:04.620 --> 00:23:07.830
and a consuming curiosity
about the things

00:23:07.830 --> 00:23:09.960
in the nighttime sky--

00:23:09.960 --> 00:23:12.210
would come along, too.

00:23:12.210 --> 00:23:16.440
And in all of that time,
not a single earthly eye

00:23:16.440 --> 00:23:20.640
had ever seen what the
six human eyes belonging

00:23:20.640 --> 00:23:24.270
to the three men in the
Apollo spacecraft were seeing.

00:23:28.090 --> 00:23:30.910
It would become a matter
of historical record

00:23:30.910 --> 00:23:34.360
that the Apollo 8 engine
burn would succeed,

00:23:34.360 --> 00:23:37.210
that the crew would
settle safely into orbit

00:23:37.210 --> 00:23:41.110
and remain there for their
10 planned revolutions or 20

00:23:41.110 --> 00:23:42.580
hours.

00:23:42.580 --> 00:23:44.350
It would become a
matter of history,

00:23:44.350 --> 00:23:49.210
too, that on Christmas Eve at
about 9 PM East Coast time,

00:23:49.210 --> 00:23:52.930
they would point their camera
back out the window and beam

00:23:52.930 --> 00:23:56.410
images of the lunar
landscape crawling slowly

00:23:56.410 --> 00:24:00.380
beneath their spacecraft
to a television audience

00:24:00.380 --> 00:24:05.320
that this time measured an
estimated 1 billion people,

00:24:05.320 --> 00:24:10.600
or nearly one out of every three
human beings on the planet.

00:24:10.600 --> 00:24:13.780
And finally, it would
become a matter of history,

00:24:13.780 --> 00:24:19.570
too, that on that extraordinary
night in that murderous year,

00:24:19.570 --> 00:24:23.110
they would end their broadcast
with biblical versus,

00:24:23.110 --> 00:24:26.230
the versus of Genesis
that spoke of birth.

00:24:28.950 --> 00:24:31.830
Apollo 8 could
never fully balance

00:24:31.830 --> 00:24:35.190
the mortal ledger of 1968.

00:24:35.190 --> 00:24:39.390
The lives that were lost that
year were lost all the same.

00:24:39.390 --> 00:24:43.020
The wars that were fought
were fought all the same.

00:24:43.020 --> 00:24:45.480
But that didn't mean
Apollo 8 couldn't

00:24:45.480 --> 00:24:49.170
redeem the year, and
in some small way,

00:24:49.170 --> 00:24:53.400
redeem the civilization that
had sent the crew out on so

00:24:53.400 --> 00:24:56.040
outrageous a mission.

00:24:56.040 --> 00:24:58.260
There were political,
industrial,

00:24:58.260 --> 00:25:01.380
and scientific reasons
to go to the moon.

00:25:01.380 --> 00:25:03.510
But we went to
the moon in a year

00:25:03.510 --> 00:25:07.230
we had no business going
there, because at some level,

00:25:07.230 --> 00:25:10.020
we couldn't not go.

00:25:10.020 --> 00:25:13.590
Because we get restless
standing on one peak

00:25:13.590 --> 00:25:17.220
for too long without
yielding to the urge

00:25:17.220 --> 00:25:21.630
to explore the other peak,
because to sit on a shore

00:25:21.630 --> 00:25:26.520
and look that the ocean is
to be haunted by that expanse

00:25:26.520 --> 00:25:30.750
until we at last get
up, sail out across it,

00:25:30.750 --> 00:25:34.650
and then taunt it back
from the opposite shore.

00:25:34.650 --> 00:25:39.510
Apollo 8 was just that kind
of act of defiance and joy

00:25:39.510 --> 00:25:41.610
and courage, too.

00:25:41.610 --> 00:25:46.110
In a very dark time, it
brought us all a tiny bit

00:25:46.110 --> 00:25:49.241
further into the light.

00:25:49.241 --> 00:25:49.740
Thank you.

00:25:58.820 --> 00:26:03.650
Now I would love to take
questions about this mission.

00:26:03.650 --> 00:26:08.690
As I hope I conveyed, it is a
mission that's moved me deeply

00:26:08.690 --> 00:26:10.340
since the days it happened.

00:26:10.340 --> 00:26:14.180
And I was old enough, still
very little, but old enough

00:26:14.180 --> 00:26:17.150
now to have watched it happen.

00:26:17.150 --> 00:26:19.850
Any thoughts or
questions at all?

00:26:19.850 --> 00:26:23.690
AUDIENCE: I once heard someone
describe the Apollo missions

00:26:23.690 --> 00:26:27.000
as the world's smallest
most expensive pyramid

00:26:27.000 --> 00:26:28.655
to John F. Kennedy.

00:26:31.340 --> 00:26:35.577
Would you agree with that
statement, or do you think--

00:26:35.577 --> 00:26:37.160
JEFFREY KLUGER: You
mean that in terms

00:26:37.160 --> 00:26:41.210
of sort of great
monuments to human vanity.

00:26:41.210 --> 00:26:42.835
AUDIENCE: Great
monuments to your king.

00:26:42.835 --> 00:26:44.043
JEFFREY KLUGER: To your king.

00:26:44.043 --> 00:26:45.140
Oh, that's fascinating.

00:26:45.140 --> 00:26:47.540
No, I don't think that at all.

00:26:47.540 --> 00:26:53.030
Look, I think Kennedy
was a charismatic leader.

00:26:53.030 --> 00:26:55.940
He quickly became
a martyred leader,

00:26:55.940 --> 00:27:00.560
and that absolutely
helped fuel the program.

00:27:00.560 --> 00:27:03.650
The US had committed before
Kennedy died-- and remember,

00:27:03.650 --> 00:27:06.350
it was two years between the
time he made this commitment

00:27:06.350 --> 00:27:07.700
and the time he died--

00:27:07.700 --> 00:27:10.040
so the US had already
committed itself

00:27:10.040 --> 00:27:12.230
to doing this
extraordinary thing.

00:27:12.230 --> 00:27:16.010
I do believe that
Kennedy's death made

00:27:16.010 --> 00:27:17.840
it now non-negotiable.

00:27:17.840 --> 00:27:21.080
Had Kennedy lived
and had he suffered

00:27:21.080 --> 00:27:26.450
the challenges and the
swings in popularity

00:27:26.450 --> 00:27:29.060
that any president
faces, I suspect

00:27:29.060 --> 00:27:31.940
that the space program
would have come under more

00:27:31.940 --> 00:27:33.410
intense attack than it did.

00:27:33.410 --> 00:27:36.110
And there were plenty of budget
conscious people in Congress

00:27:36.110 --> 00:27:39.250
who were opposed to
it, or at least opposed

00:27:39.250 --> 00:27:40.560
to moving so quickly.

00:27:40.560 --> 00:27:43.880
So sure, Kennedy's
commitment to do it

00:27:43.880 --> 00:27:49.445
made it a moral, emotional,
romantic imperative for the US.

00:27:52.040 --> 00:27:53.900
I would say that--

00:27:53.900 --> 00:27:56.810
in some ways, if I were going
to be more cynical about it,

00:27:56.810 --> 00:28:00.770
I would say it was the least
expensive arms race in history,

00:28:00.770 --> 00:28:03.050
because it was an arms
race, but with arms

00:28:03.050 --> 00:28:04.730
that weren't going
to hurt anybody,

00:28:04.730 --> 00:28:07.540
unless, of course, you
took the spacecraft off,

00:28:07.540 --> 00:28:10.760
say, the Atlas boosters
or the R1 boosters

00:28:10.760 --> 00:28:13.520
and put ICBMs on them, which
is what they were built for.

00:28:13.520 --> 00:28:16.250
But we tried not to
think about that.

00:28:16.250 --> 00:28:19.250
But no, I think
it was an exercise

00:28:19.250 --> 00:28:27.440
in American projection of
power, but of moral power

00:28:27.440 --> 00:28:28.970
and of courageous power.

00:28:28.970 --> 00:28:30.665
And I do not--

00:28:33.350 --> 00:28:36.740
I don't minimize the point
I was making earlier, which

00:28:36.740 --> 00:28:40.100
is I really do think
that this was a paradigm

00:28:40.100 --> 00:28:41.420
shift for the species.

00:28:41.420 --> 00:28:44.030
It was a hinge point
for the species.

00:28:44.030 --> 00:28:46.790
It was the point
at which we decided

00:28:46.790 --> 00:28:51.950
that we had the wherewithal to
venture off the only world we

00:28:51.950 --> 00:28:56.180
ever got, and by some
rights, the only world

00:28:56.180 --> 00:28:58.860
we were ever supposed
to touch, and say,

00:28:58.860 --> 00:29:02.840
we can do this crazy thing and
we're committed to doing it

00:29:02.840 --> 00:29:07.590
and we're committing to doing
it on a deadline-- by 1970.

00:29:07.590 --> 00:29:09.770
AUDIENCE: Do you know
if the Soviets actually

00:29:09.770 --> 00:29:15.020
had a realistic chance of
beating this mission to a lunar

00:29:15.020 --> 00:29:15.740
orbit?

00:29:15.740 --> 00:29:19.300
Do you have any thoughts of how
that would have been received

00:29:19.300 --> 00:29:21.880
either by the world
or by the country

00:29:21.880 --> 00:29:24.957
had this mission
actually been Soviet?

00:29:24.957 --> 00:29:26.790
JEFFREY KLUGER: That's
a very good question,

00:29:26.790 --> 00:29:27.770
and the answer is yes.

00:29:27.770 --> 00:29:31.020
And I write about this at
some length in the book.

00:29:31.020 --> 00:29:33.740
One of the things that
energized NASA was

00:29:33.740 --> 00:29:37.370
in that same summer, they
had gotten intelligence

00:29:37.370 --> 00:29:41.660
reports that the Soviet Union
was planning a circumlunar

00:29:41.660 --> 00:29:44.210
mission, and in fact, was about
to launch them, and in fact,

00:29:44.210 --> 00:29:45.560
had launched them.

00:29:45.560 --> 00:29:49.820
They were two flights,
Zond 5 and Zond 6.

00:29:49.820 --> 00:29:51.140
They were circumlunar flights.

00:29:51.140 --> 00:29:53.270
They took the
easier route that we

00:29:53.270 --> 00:29:55.400
were considering around
the far side of the moon

00:29:55.400 --> 00:29:57.770
and straight back home.

00:29:57.770 --> 00:30:02.400
On both flights, they had
small animals, insects,

00:30:02.400 --> 00:30:04.850
and I think mice.

00:30:04.850 --> 00:30:10.570
And in one of the
launches, the mice,

00:30:10.570 --> 00:30:14.690
the insects survived,
but the re-entry card

00:30:14.690 --> 00:30:17.900
or the re-entry
angle was too steep

00:30:17.900 --> 00:30:21.230
for it to have been considered
a safe mission for humans.

00:30:21.230 --> 00:30:23.240
In the second one,
the animals did not

00:30:23.240 --> 00:30:25.190
survive, partly because the--

00:30:25.190 --> 00:30:27.410
entirely because
the parachute chose

00:30:27.410 --> 00:30:31.340
to detach about 100 miles above
the ground, which is no way

00:30:31.340 --> 00:30:32.930
to survive a re-entry.

00:30:32.930 --> 00:30:37.490
So the Soviets knew that they
weren't ready to do this.

00:30:37.490 --> 00:30:40.960
Had they succeeded,
I strongly believe

00:30:40.960 --> 00:30:43.520
the US would have
continued pushing hard,

00:30:43.520 --> 00:30:45.332
because there were
still other ways to win.

00:30:45.332 --> 00:30:46.790
We could have done
the orbit first.

00:30:46.790 --> 00:30:48.827
We could have stuck
the landing first.

00:30:48.827 --> 00:30:50.660
And I think had the
Russians succeeded, they

00:30:50.660 --> 00:30:53.000
would have gone that way, too.

00:30:53.000 --> 00:30:58.580
They also had a heavy lift
rocket like the Saturn 5.

00:30:58.580 --> 00:31:01.790
But in the same way that I
said the Saturn 5 created

00:31:01.790 --> 00:31:05.610
the greatest sound apart
from a nuclear explosion,

00:31:05.610 --> 00:31:06.270
their rocket--

00:31:06.270 --> 00:31:09.380
the N1-- at one point did
explode on the ground,

00:31:09.380 --> 00:31:12.170
and it was the largest
explosion in history

00:31:12.170 --> 00:31:15.680
apart from a nuclear explosion.

00:31:15.680 --> 00:31:18.830
So they had some wee
technological problems

00:31:18.830 --> 00:31:21.750
to overcome, and they did not
have the financial wherewithal

00:31:21.750 --> 00:31:24.290
we had.

00:31:24.290 --> 00:31:26.600
Communism was a
well-intentioned system,

00:31:26.600 --> 00:31:29.120
but it never balanced its books.

00:31:29.120 --> 00:31:32.350
So they didn't have
the money that we had.

00:31:32.350 --> 00:31:35.400
AUDIENCE: So I had another
technological question.

00:31:35.400 --> 00:31:38.420
There was a great circa
1950 science fiction

00:31:38.420 --> 00:31:41.330
movie called "Destination
Moon," which Robert Heinlein was

00:31:41.330 --> 00:31:42.890
the advisor for.

00:31:42.890 --> 00:31:46.940
And people used an atomic rocket
to get to the moon with water

00:31:46.940 --> 00:31:48.110
as reaction mass.

00:31:48.110 --> 00:31:50.860
I was saying, well, OK,
that was a good sci-fi idea,

00:31:50.860 --> 00:31:53.180
but clearly we weren't
going to do it.

00:31:53.180 --> 00:31:56.810
But I was at the atomic
testing museum with our company

00:31:56.810 --> 00:32:01.130
trip in Las Vegas recently and
saw an atomic rocket engine

00:32:01.130 --> 00:32:04.970
that had been tested
in the early 60s, which

00:32:04.970 --> 00:32:08.255
used an atomic reactor and
hydrogen. It was considerably

00:32:08.255 --> 00:32:10.130
more efficient than the
engines we ultimately

00:32:10.130 --> 00:32:11.030
used on the Saturn 5.

00:32:11.030 --> 00:32:12.655
And I just wondered
if you had any more

00:32:12.655 --> 00:32:16.980
detail about the
atomic rocketry trials.

00:32:16.980 --> 00:32:20.540
JEFFREY KLUGER: The problem with
atomic rocketry was two things.

00:32:20.540 --> 00:32:22.286
It was infinitely more complex.

00:32:22.286 --> 00:32:24.410
And what you're doing when
you're building rockets,

00:32:24.410 --> 00:32:28.130
which try as hard as they
possibly can on any launch

00:32:28.130 --> 00:32:30.180
to blow up and kill you--

00:32:30.180 --> 00:32:32.930
what you're trying to do
is minimize moving parts

00:32:32.930 --> 00:32:34.270
and minimize risk.

00:32:34.270 --> 00:32:38.030
So that was-- that
mitigated against that.

00:32:38.030 --> 00:32:41.390
Also, a chemical
explosion is very

00:32:41.390 --> 00:32:43.970
different from a
nuclear explosion.

00:32:43.970 --> 00:32:48.380
As recently as 1997, there
was all manner of outcry

00:32:48.380 --> 00:32:52.400
when the Cassini spacecraft
was launched to Saturn,

00:32:52.400 --> 00:32:56.690
simply because it has a
small radiothermal generator

00:32:56.690 --> 00:32:58.700
as a power system,
and that was basically

00:32:58.700 --> 00:33:01.490
a pellet of plutonium I think.

00:33:01.490 --> 00:33:03.076
And there was global
outcry about what

00:33:03.076 --> 00:33:04.200
would happen if it blew up.

00:33:04.200 --> 00:33:06.470
So I think the risks
were too considerable.

00:33:06.470 --> 00:33:10.460
Now, as magnificent
as the Saturn 5 was,

00:33:10.460 --> 00:33:13.580
there are some very crude
things about liquid rocketry.

00:33:13.580 --> 00:33:16.550
The first stage of the
Saturn 5 was fueled partly

00:33:16.550 --> 00:33:21.020
by liquid oxygen, which sounds
nice and clean and modernistic.

00:33:21.020 --> 00:33:23.400
It's very cold.

00:33:23.400 --> 00:33:26.070
It's cryogenic, so that
sounds nice and modern.

00:33:26.070 --> 00:33:28.670
But filling most of
the tanks was kerosene,

00:33:28.670 --> 00:33:31.670
so we were back in the
old era of the hurricane

00:33:31.670 --> 00:33:34.832
lamp and launching rockets
with that chemistry.

00:33:34.832 --> 00:33:37.040
AUDIENCE: So the movie that
came out a few years ago,

00:33:37.040 --> 00:33:38.540
"Gravity," I know
there were debates

00:33:38.540 --> 00:33:39.914
about how
scientifically accurate

00:33:39.914 --> 00:33:41.390
it was with regard to space.

00:33:41.390 --> 00:33:42.860
But the thing that
struck me most

00:33:42.860 --> 00:33:46.190
was the final scene where Sandra
Bullock ends up on the shore

00:33:46.190 --> 00:33:48.500
and is just so
grateful to be back.

00:33:48.500 --> 00:33:50.540
Of all of the
astronauts with whom

00:33:50.540 --> 00:33:53.260
you've spoken, both from
Apollo 8 and Apollo 13--

00:33:53.260 --> 00:33:56.370
and granted, 13
had its own story--

00:33:56.370 --> 00:33:59.130
have you noticed more of a
trend among those astronauts

00:33:59.130 --> 00:34:02.330
to longing for space
or being really

00:34:02.330 --> 00:34:03.410
glad to be back on Earth?

00:34:03.410 --> 00:34:05.957
Is there some type of pull
that they have in particular?

00:34:05.957 --> 00:34:07.790
JEFFREY KLUGER: That's
a fantastic question.

00:34:07.790 --> 00:34:10.280
Just two things I want to
say about "Gravity" first.

00:34:10.280 --> 00:34:12.920
There were a few physics
issues with "Gravity,"

00:34:12.920 --> 00:34:14.330
but the thing that
struck me most

00:34:14.330 --> 00:34:16.159
was that when
Sandra Bullock gets

00:34:16.159 --> 00:34:18.770
back inside that spacecraft
after her space walk

00:34:18.770 --> 00:34:23.510
and sheds her suit and
she's in the little boy gym

00:34:23.510 --> 00:34:26.840
shorts and the little tank
top and it looks like she's

00:34:26.840 --> 00:34:30.139
ready to go to Equinox,
she would, in fact, have

00:34:30.139 --> 00:34:33.020
been wearing a
complete union suit

00:34:33.020 --> 00:34:35.540
with 100 feet of
[INAUDIBLE] cable

00:34:35.540 --> 00:34:37.800
in it and an adult diaper.

00:34:37.800 --> 00:34:43.219
Now, that's just not as sexy as
what Hollywood was going for.

00:34:43.219 --> 00:34:45.889
The other great
detail about "Gravity"

00:34:45.889 --> 00:34:51.680
is that it cost
India $75 million

00:34:51.680 --> 00:34:54.500
to send their first
spacecraft to Mars,

00:34:54.500 --> 00:34:58.100
and India has been the first
country and only country so far

00:34:58.100 --> 00:35:00.290
to get Mars right
on its first try.

00:35:00.290 --> 00:35:01.980
Every other country
fails all the time

00:35:01.980 --> 00:35:03.560
when we first try
to get to Mars.

00:35:03.560 --> 00:35:05.840
Their $75 million
was less than the

00:35:05.840 --> 00:35:12.080
cost to make "Gravity,"
so props to the Indians.

00:35:12.080 --> 00:35:16.400
Every astronaut has a
different take on that.

00:35:16.400 --> 00:35:19.060
Jim Lovell-- as I
say in the book,

00:35:19.060 --> 00:35:23.870
I think Jim was never quite so
happy as when he was in space

00:35:23.870 --> 00:35:26.090
and never quite
so happy in space

00:35:26.090 --> 00:35:29.330
as when he was incredibly
busy and doing some crazy ass

00:35:29.330 --> 00:35:31.520
thing like navigating
his way to the moon.

00:35:31.520 --> 00:35:34.700
And I just texted him recently,
and I wanted to warn him,

00:35:34.700 --> 00:35:38.060
because Jim and I worked
together on "Apollo 13."

00:35:38.060 --> 00:35:40.580
And obviously, that story
was very Lovell centric.

00:35:40.580 --> 00:35:43.740
And Apollo 8, Frank
Borman was the commander,

00:35:43.740 --> 00:35:46.250
so it's commander centric.

00:35:46.250 --> 00:35:49.400
And I wrote him and said,
I hope you like the movie.

00:35:49.400 --> 00:35:53.060
You may have to wade through
40 more pages of Frank Borman

00:35:53.060 --> 00:35:55.670
back story than you might
like before you get there.

00:35:55.670 --> 00:35:58.430
And he wrote back, and he
said, as long as you remember

00:35:58.430 --> 00:36:01.550
to say that I navigated those
two characters to the moon,

00:36:01.550 --> 00:36:03.440
I'll be fine.

00:36:03.440 --> 00:36:04.880
He loved being in space.

00:36:04.880 --> 00:36:06.860
Frank Borman was a
very different man.

00:36:06.860 --> 00:36:11.270
Borman comes across in
my book-- and he readily

00:36:11.270 --> 00:36:14.750
owns up to this-- he was a very
serious guy, very hardheaded,

00:36:14.750 --> 00:36:16.070
very much a grind.

00:36:16.070 --> 00:36:17.810
And I don't mean
that in a nasty way,

00:36:17.810 --> 00:36:21.120
I mean that in get the job done.

00:36:21.120 --> 00:36:26.360
Now he is much more frank and
quite funny actually at age 88.

00:36:26.360 --> 00:36:31.070
I did not expect that when
I got to know Frank Borman.

00:36:31.070 --> 00:36:34.160
And I asked him
the question he's

00:36:34.160 --> 00:36:35.360
been asked a million times.

00:36:35.360 --> 00:36:37.200
I said, when you're
outside at night--

00:36:37.200 --> 00:36:41.510
and he lives in Billings-- and
the skies are just glass clear,

00:36:41.510 --> 00:36:46.280
and I said you look up and it's
a full moon, do you ever think,

00:36:46.280 --> 00:36:48.760
I can't believe I was there?

00:36:48.760 --> 00:36:51.410
And he said, I've tried,
because people always tell me

00:36:51.410 --> 00:36:53.870
I should feel like that.

00:36:53.870 --> 00:36:55.520
It just never clicked for me.

00:36:55.520 --> 00:36:58.880
And he said, look, the
moon did nothing for me.

00:36:58.880 --> 00:37:00.920
It was Earth that did it for me.

00:37:00.920 --> 00:37:02.960
And Bill Anders
said that, as well.

00:37:02.960 --> 00:37:05.600
He said, we went to the
moon to discover that Earth.

00:37:05.600 --> 00:37:08.090
I think some of these
guys, when they get home,

00:37:08.090 --> 00:37:11.210
they're happy to be home.

00:37:11.210 --> 00:37:12.890
We shouldn't lose
sight of the fact

00:37:12.890 --> 00:37:16.910
that we have just the coolest
planet in the solar system

00:37:16.910 --> 00:37:18.920
and possibly in the universe.

00:37:18.920 --> 00:37:21.530
It's perfect in all
respects for life.

00:37:21.530 --> 00:37:22.880
And it's gorgeous.

00:37:22.880 --> 00:37:27.560
It hangs in space, this swirl
of color in a solar system--

00:37:27.560 --> 00:37:32.170
Jupiter's got some color, but
those are all toxic clouds.

00:37:32.170 --> 00:37:34.580
We got a terrarian here.

00:37:34.580 --> 00:37:35.900
It's magnificent.

00:37:35.900 --> 00:37:39.530
So when you-- especially when
you're flying over the moon,

00:37:39.530 --> 00:37:41.390
and it's a wasteland--

00:37:41.390 --> 00:37:43.790
there's a reason that when
we talk about something

00:37:43.790 --> 00:37:47.420
that's terrible and bleak these
days, we call it a moonscape.

00:37:47.420 --> 00:37:50.230
The moonscape is one
nasty, ugly place.

00:37:50.230 --> 00:37:50.840
It's dead.

00:37:50.840 --> 00:37:51.440
It's gray.

00:37:51.440 --> 00:37:52.070
It's dry.

00:37:52.070 --> 00:37:53.630
It's windless.

00:37:53.630 --> 00:37:57.260
It's got an ugly beauty,
but you can't get away

00:37:57.260 --> 00:37:58.460
from the ugly part.

00:37:58.460 --> 00:38:00.140
The Earth is
magnificent, and I think

00:38:00.140 --> 00:38:03.380
there are some astronauts
who really want to be back

00:38:03.380 --> 00:38:05.510
when they're done and
other astronauts who

00:38:05.510 --> 00:38:08.000
just love the heck out
of flying in space.

00:38:08.000 --> 00:38:09.380
So it depends on the person.

00:38:13.460 --> 00:38:14.960
AUDIENCE: So you
talked a little bit

00:38:14.960 --> 00:38:18.560
about how the astronauts
broadcast images from space.

00:38:21.540 --> 00:38:23.540
I'm wondering what the
reaction was in countries

00:38:23.540 --> 00:38:25.970
like the Soviet Union when--

00:38:25.970 --> 00:38:29.420
were those images also broadcast
live on TV in those countries?

00:38:29.420 --> 00:38:31.110
I'm sure there was
some censorship.

00:38:31.110 --> 00:38:32.570
And if you could
talk a little bit

00:38:32.570 --> 00:38:37.820
about how the USSR and some
of the sort of adversaries

00:38:37.820 --> 00:38:40.530
of the United States
reacted to this.

00:38:40.530 --> 00:38:42.830
JEFFREY KLUGER: It's a
really good question, and one

00:38:42.830 --> 00:38:46.730
of the research tools that I
found very helpful that Jim

00:38:46.730 --> 00:38:48.170
Lovell recommended to me--

00:38:48.170 --> 00:38:49.400
I wasn't aware of it--

00:38:49.400 --> 00:38:54.920
was a book by a man named
Boris Chertoff or Chertok.

00:38:54.920 --> 00:38:56.630
"Rockets and Men,"
it was called.

00:38:56.630 --> 00:39:01.950
It's a four volume set from
inside the Soviet space

00:39:01.950 --> 00:39:02.450
program.

00:39:02.450 --> 00:39:05.390
Back then, he was a man in
the room where it happened,

00:39:05.390 --> 00:39:09.320
and he was aware of
everything that was going on.

00:39:09.320 --> 00:39:12.350
And he said that, yes, it was--

00:39:12.350 --> 00:39:14.720
nothing was shown live.

00:39:14.720 --> 00:39:18.290
In the Moscow central
research bureau, basically

00:39:18.290 --> 00:39:24.770
their National Science
Foundation outside of Moscow,

00:39:24.770 --> 00:39:28.310
they did screen the
launch on a big screen

00:39:28.310 --> 00:39:31.280
for just the people
who were there,

00:39:31.280 --> 00:39:33.590
and it was under tight security.

00:39:33.590 --> 00:39:35.200
And he admitted
to a funny thing.

00:39:35.200 --> 00:39:39.950
If you've ever seen the footage
of a Saturn 5 taking off,

00:39:39.950 --> 00:39:42.450
when that big first
stage separates--

00:39:42.450 --> 00:39:47.060
it's about 26 miles
up at that point--

00:39:47.060 --> 00:39:50.180
there are explosive bolts
and small rocket jets

00:39:50.180 --> 00:39:51.060
that separated.

00:39:51.060 --> 00:39:54.590
So for an instant, it looks
like the rocket blew up.

00:39:54.590 --> 00:39:58.070
And then those--
that burst subsides,

00:39:58.070 --> 00:40:00.290
and you see the first
stage fall away safely,

00:40:00.290 --> 00:40:02.240
and the second stage ignites.

00:40:02.240 --> 00:40:04.670
And he confessed that
everybody in that room

00:40:04.670 --> 00:40:07.850
had an immediate
sense of-- there

00:40:07.850 --> 00:40:11.030
was this oppositional tension,
because on the one hand,

00:40:11.030 --> 00:40:14.730
all of them thought, it blew
up, we're still in the game.

00:40:14.730 --> 00:40:17.450
And on the other
hand, all of them

00:40:17.450 --> 00:40:19.550
honored the missile
man's credo, which

00:40:19.550 --> 00:40:22.370
is that you never root
for the other guy's rocket

00:40:22.370 --> 00:40:25.910
to blow up, especially when
three people are on board.

00:40:25.910 --> 00:40:28.790
But once it got to space,
and it left Earth orbit,

00:40:28.790 --> 00:40:32.600
the maneuver called TLI,
trans lunar injection,

00:40:32.600 --> 00:40:35.170
which was the pivotal moment--
we're heading out to the moon

00:40:35.170 --> 00:40:36.800
now--

00:40:36.800 --> 00:40:38.630
they shut down the
big viewing room.

00:40:38.630 --> 00:40:40.425
And they did
continue to watch it,

00:40:40.425 --> 00:40:42.050
but they watched it
with just a handful

00:40:42.050 --> 00:40:46.520
of people in a conference
room with a feed

00:40:46.520 --> 00:40:47.960
they were able to rig.

00:40:47.960 --> 00:40:49.970
I think they rigged
it from Eurovision.

00:40:49.970 --> 00:40:54.530
There was-- the thinking was
some spotty pirate signals

00:40:54.530 --> 00:40:57.800
across Soviet Union and
presumably across China,

00:40:57.800 --> 00:41:00.890
as well, Eastern
Europe, any place

00:41:00.890 --> 00:41:02.330
under the Soviet lock down.

00:41:02.330 --> 00:41:06.170
And back then, the
right aluminum foil

00:41:06.170 --> 00:41:09.810
on the right rabbit ear antennas
with the right Radio Shack box,

00:41:09.810 --> 00:41:11.801
you could pirate
a crackly signal.

00:41:11.801 --> 00:41:13.550
But for the most part,
it wasn't reported.

00:41:13.550 --> 00:41:17.150
To their credit,
when the spacecraft

00:41:17.150 --> 00:41:21.260
did get into lunar orbit,
they did report that promptly

00:41:21.260 --> 00:41:22.220
on TASS.

00:41:22.220 --> 00:41:24.930
Promptly means a
couple hours later,

00:41:24.930 --> 00:41:27.830
which by Russian news
standards at the time

00:41:27.830 --> 00:41:30.594
was practically
live as it happens.

00:41:30.594 --> 00:41:32.510
But yeah, they kept it
as quiet as they could,

00:41:32.510 --> 00:41:36.150
because it was a big blow
to the Soviet space program.

00:41:39.940 --> 00:41:43.120
AUDIENCE: Just a quick
addition to your answer.

00:41:43.120 --> 00:41:46.300
In Soviet Union up
until 80s, there

00:41:46.300 --> 00:41:50.870
were no direct
broadcast of any launch.

00:41:50.870 --> 00:41:55.370
It was one exception, which
was Apollo-Soyuz in 1975.

00:41:55.370 --> 00:42:00.432
Everything else was tape delayed
for at least two, three hours.

00:42:00.432 --> 00:42:01.640
JEFFREY KLUGER: Is that true?

00:42:01.640 --> 00:42:04.210
AUDIENCE: Yes, and it
was complete blackout

00:42:04.210 --> 00:42:08.590
of 1968 and '69 lunar missions.

00:42:08.590 --> 00:42:12.930
Again, it was exception
of newspaper article

00:42:12.930 --> 00:42:15.700
next day that--

00:42:15.700 --> 00:42:18.940
JEFFREY KLUGER: Apollo-Soyuz
was, as most people probably

00:42:18.940 --> 00:42:23.860
know, it was a result of
Nixon, Brezhnev, Detente.

00:42:23.860 --> 00:42:28.240
And an Apollo spacecraft met
a Soyuz spacecraft in orbit,

00:42:28.240 --> 00:42:29.950
and they docked.

00:42:29.950 --> 00:42:32.140
Shortly before--
that was in 1975.

00:42:32.140 --> 00:42:36.800
In 1971, the Soyuz 11
spacecraft returned to Earth.

00:42:36.800 --> 00:42:39.040
It was one of their
great space tragedies

00:42:39.040 --> 00:42:41.880
only a few years after
our Apollo 1 tragedy.

00:42:41.880 --> 00:42:42.880
It re-entered.

00:42:42.880 --> 00:42:45.179
The guys were perfectly
fine as they re-entered.

00:42:45.179 --> 00:42:46.720
When they came out
of blackout, there

00:42:46.720 --> 00:42:49.090
was absolute silence
from the spacecraft,

00:42:49.090 --> 00:42:53.770
and the ship had catastrophic
depressurized on the way down.

00:42:53.770 --> 00:42:56.470
And they died.

00:42:56.470 --> 00:42:58.360
Flash forward a
couple of years, we're

00:42:58.360 --> 00:43:00.010
preparing for a Apollo-Soyuz.

00:43:00.010 --> 00:43:01.570
We knew there had
to be an adapter

00:43:01.570 --> 00:43:05.590
module, airtight adapter module,
built between the two ships

00:43:05.590 --> 00:43:07.480
so that they could
dock properly and there

00:43:07.480 --> 00:43:09.040
would be a tunnel between them.

00:43:09.040 --> 00:43:11.481
And the Soviet Union said,
we can take care of this

00:43:11.481 --> 00:43:11.980
if you want.

00:43:11.980 --> 00:43:14.000
And NASA said, we'll handle it.

00:43:14.000 --> 00:43:15.600
That's OK.

00:43:15.600 --> 00:43:17.500
We're on top of this.

00:43:17.500 --> 00:43:19.510
And Russia agreed,
and I think they

00:43:19.510 --> 00:43:23.980
understood it was because
that was sort of a trauma.

00:43:23.980 --> 00:43:26.520
That one worked nicely.

00:43:26.520 --> 00:43:28.020
AUDIENCE: So first
of all, thank you

00:43:28.020 --> 00:43:33.240
very much for coming and telling
us those very amazing stories.

00:43:33.240 --> 00:43:36.036
My question is,
as you mentioned,

00:43:36.036 --> 00:43:40.590
Apollo 8 was the first
in very many aspects

00:43:40.590 --> 00:43:45.110
of space exploration,
including relighting

00:43:45.110 --> 00:43:49.260
of the engine like three days
after the launch and high speed

00:43:49.260 --> 00:43:52.050
re-entry on the way back.

00:43:52.050 --> 00:43:57.000
So very shortly after Apollo
7 disaster and tragedy,

00:43:57.000 --> 00:44:01.580
why wasn't this mission
flown as unmanned mission?

00:44:01.580 --> 00:44:04.440
It's one of the unique cases
where there was nothing

00:44:04.440 --> 00:44:09.120
sent before and nothing
was tested before

00:44:09.120 --> 00:44:10.847
without actual people on board.

00:44:10.847 --> 00:44:12.930
JEFFREY KLUGER: Well,
that's a very good question.

00:44:12.930 --> 00:44:15.600
Actually, there were Apollo--

00:44:15.600 --> 00:44:17.690
2 unmanned Apollo
flights tested.

00:44:17.690 --> 00:44:25.680
One, Apollo 4 in late 1967,
which was a terrific success.

00:44:25.680 --> 00:44:29.610
One, Apollo 6,
which was in early

00:44:29.610 --> 00:44:33.390
'68, which was a disaster when
the Saturn 5 almost tore itself

00:44:33.390 --> 00:44:34.080
apart.

00:44:34.080 --> 00:44:40.560
The idea of Apollo 8 was to
jumpstart what was going on.

00:44:40.560 --> 00:44:45.690
The idea was to say, we are
capable of doing this thing,

00:44:45.690 --> 00:44:48.780
and we are done
being overcautious.

00:44:48.780 --> 00:44:50.790
The agency had
become risk averse

00:44:50.790 --> 00:44:54.210
as they certainly had a
right to be after Apollo 1.

00:44:54.210 --> 00:44:57.150
They knew that their budgets
were always on the line.

00:44:57.150 --> 00:45:03.060
And they realized in order to
keep the momentum going here,

00:45:03.060 --> 00:45:06.660
we have got to be willing
to make this happen

00:45:06.660 --> 00:45:09.630
and to put people on
board this spacecraft

00:45:09.630 --> 00:45:14.100
and move the ball forward
if we have any chance at all

00:45:14.100 --> 00:45:16.410
of landing on the moon by 1968.

00:45:16.410 --> 00:45:20.220
There's one great thing
that I've always thought,

00:45:20.220 --> 00:45:23.100
and that is we do--
as human beings,

00:45:23.100 --> 00:45:27.070
we anthropomorphize
our machines.

00:45:27.070 --> 00:45:32.100
So we send the little Mars
Pathfinder Lander to Mars

00:45:32.100 --> 00:45:33.870
in 1997.

00:45:33.870 --> 00:45:37.520
And we-- it was like the size of
a toaster oven on a skateboard.

00:45:37.520 --> 00:45:39.540
It was absolutely adorable.

00:45:39.540 --> 00:45:44.460
And we use words like
plucky and tenacious,

00:45:44.460 --> 00:45:46.380
and I just used adorable.

00:45:46.380 --> 00:45:48.300
We anthropomorphize
our machines,

00:45:48.300 --> 00:45:53.700
because we just adore
the fact that if we can't

00:45:53.700 --> 00:45:57.900
get to these places,
at least by proxy,

00:45:57.900 --> 00:46:01.900
we can build machines that are--

00:46:01.900 --> 00:46:05.190
I saw the Cassini
orbiter, Saturn

00:46:05.190 --> 00:46:09.720
orbiter on the
floor of its factory

00:46:09.720 --> 00:46:13.170
at Jet Propulsion
Laboratory in 1997.

00:46:13.170 --> 00:46:13.710
Big thing.

00:46:13.710 --> 00:46:15.180
Weighs a ton and a half.

00:46:15.180 --> 00:46:16.470
Just huge.

00:46:16.470 --> 00:46:20.490
And I looked, and I thought
that every single component

00:46:20.490 --> 00:46:26.790
in that spacecraft was created
and handcrafted here on Earth.

00:46:26.790 --> 00:46:31.800
It is an agglomeration of
metal and silicone and rubber

00:46:31.800 --> 00:46:34.860
and plastic and all manner
of other components.

00:46:34.860 --> 00:46:38.850
And it was built by highly
evolved human hands.

00:46:38.850 --> 00:46:42.710
And it is a thing of Earth.

00:46:42.710 --> 00:46:44.220
And in a couple
of years time, its

00:46:44.220 --> 00:46:46.590
going to be a thing of Saturn.

00:46:46.590 --> 00:46:49.890
Its going to have moved
from Pasadena, California

00:46:49.890 --> 00:46:54.510
to this Saturnian system
880 million miles away, just

00:46:54.510 --> 00:46:58.810
because we said we're smart
and we're goofy and we're crazy

00:46:58.810 --> 00:47:01.930
and we're idiosyncratic
and we can do this stuff.

00:47:01.930 --> 00:47:05.850
So that's how we
react when robots go.

00:47:05.850 --> 00:47:10.860
When human beings go, we are
exponentially more thrilled.

00:47:10.860 --> 00:47:12.960
Jim Lovell, Frank
Borman, and Bill Anders

00:47:12.960 --> 00:47:14.760
did not go as Americans.

00:47:14.760 --> 00:47:16.110
I mean, yes, they did.

00:47:16.110 --> 00:47:21.660
And frankly, the fact that their
spacecraft had an American flag

00:47:21.660 --> 00:47:24.630
on it delighted me, and the
fact that the first flight

00:47:24.630 --> 00:47:27.030
on the moon was an
American flag delighted me,

00:47:27.030 --> 00:47:30.270
because America is
my favorite country.

00:47:30.270 --> 00:47:32.940
But homosapiens is
my favorite species.

00:47:32.940 --> 00:47:35.740
And these guys were us.

00:47:35.740 --> 00:47:38.490
So I think once you
got people out there,

00:47:38.490 --> 00:47:44.010
it deeply and and instantly
re-animated the space race,

00:47:44.010 --> 00:47:45.780
and I think that was
the reason to do it.

00:47:48.259 --> 00:47:49.800
AUDIENCE: I hate to
be the one asking

00:47:49.800 --> 00:47:51.120
all the cynical questions.

00:47:51.120 --> 00:47:52.870
JEFFREY KLUGER: Cynical is OK.

00:47:52.870 --> 00:47:57.660
AUDIENCE: But we all
remember the Apollo missions,

00:47:57.660 --> 00:48:00.090
and we all remember
going to the moon.

00:48:00.090 --> 00:48:03.060
But most people have
kind of forgotten

00:48:03.060 --> 00:48:06.510
that we haven't been
out of low-earth orbit

00:48:06.510 --> 00:48:07.980
for as long as
some of the people

00:48:07.980 --> 00:48:10.130
in this room have been alive.

00:48:10.130 --> 00:48:12.180
There has been no
one passed that dog

00:48:12.180 --> 00:48:14.010
paddling that you
were talking about.

00:48:16.520 --> 00:48:18.696
Some people say,
when somebody says,

00:48:18.696 --> 00:48:21.070
if we can put a man on the
moon, we can blah, blah, blah,

00:48:21.070 --> 00:48:23.210
and their answer is,
no, we used to be

00:48:23.210 --> 00:48:25.730
able to put a man on the moon.

00:48:25.730 --> 00:48:31.111
When do you think we'll ever
go back out of the Earth orbit

00:48:31.111 --> 00:48:31.610
again?

00:48:31.610 --> 00:48:33.800
JEFFREY KLUGER: Well, I'll
tell you something funny.

00:48:33.800 --> 00:48:37.290
Tom Hanks said back in 1995--

00:48:37.290 --> 00:48:41.790
and we're already talking
about more than 20 years ago.

00:48:41.790 --> 00:48:44.240
We were at a lunch
at the National Press

00:48:44.240 --> 00:48:46.080
Club in New York--

00:48:46.080 --> 00:48:47.950
I mean in Washington.

00:48:47.950 --> 00:48:49.640
And he said, the
thing that strikes

00:48:49.640 --> 00:48:54.060
me is here we are in 1995.

00:48:54.060 --> 00:48:56.780
We are making a movie
that is essentially

00:48:56.780 --> 00:49:00.140
a period piece with
all of the women

00:49:00.140 --> 00:49:02.570
in the movie with
beehive hairdos

00:49:02.570 --> 00:49:06.770
and all of the men in these
fabrics not found in nature--

00:49:06.770 --> 00:49:08.480
banlon shirts.

00:49:08.480 --> 00:49:12.830
And the kitchen appliances are
all harvest gold or avocado

00:49:12.830 --> 00:49:13.340
green.

00:49:13.340 --> 00:49:15.830
Why that was ever
fashionable, I don't know.

00:49:15.830 --> 00:49:22.490
And all of the cars are big
1970s, 1960s gas guzzlers.

00:49:22.490 --> 00:49:25.520
And yet, they were
capable of a technology

00:49:25.520 --> 00:49:27.990
that we can't do anymore.

00:49:27.990 --> 00:49:32.180
They were doing things
we're not capable of doing.

00:49:32.180 --> 00:49:36.470
I've always said that of
all of the millions of words

00:49:36.470 --> 00:49:40.890
John Kennedy spoke in his
long political career,

00:49:40.890 --> 00:49:44.390
there was a single verb
in a single speech that

00:49:44.390 --> 00:49:48.800
was the most empowering,
and that was choose.

00:49:48.800 --> 00:49:52.350
When he said, we choose
to go to the moon,

00:49:52.350 --> 00:49:54.920
not because it's easy, but
because it's hard-- which was

00:49:54.920 --> 00:49:58.310
also a very nice point to make.

00:49:58.310 --> 00:49:59.660
We didn't have to go.

00:49:59.660 --> 00:50:01.850
We weren't requested to go.

00:50:01.850 --> 00:50:04.100
We were not under
imminent threat

00:50:04.100 --> 00:50:08.840
of military attack or national
starvation if we didn't go.

00:50:08.840 --> 00:50:13.460
We chose to go, because that's
what human beings like to do,

00:50:13.460 --> 00:50:16.040
because we prove
ourselves, because we

00:50:16.040 --> 00:50:17.660
assert ourselves that way.

00:50:17.660 --> 00:50:22.850
I always say that you get a NASA
administrator before Congress,

00:50:22.850 --> 00:50:25.420
and they say, well, why
should we allocate $20 billion

00:50:25.420 --> 00:50:26.990
this year to NASA?

00:50:26.990 --> 00:50:29.150
And he'll talk about
military spin offs,

00:50:29.150 --> 00:50:31.100
and he'll talk about
technological spin offs

00:50:31.100 --> 00:50:33.500
and security spin offs.

00:50:33.500 --> 00:50:35.570
What he's not
allowed to say is, we

00:50:35.570 --> 00:50:38.690
go to the moon for the
same reason we write poetry

00:50:38.690 --> 00:50:42.800
and we choreograph ballets
and we compose symphonies

00:50:42.800 --> 00:50:48.650
and we gather in stadiums
by the tens of thousands

00:50:48.650 --> 00:50:52.970
to watch a football game that
has absolutely no meaning.

00:50:52.970 --> 00:50:55.760
Not a single one of those
things does anything at all

00:50:55.760 --> 00:50:58.220
to keep us alive, but
they are all reasons

00:50:58.220 --> 00:51:02.580
we choose and revel in being
alive in the first place.

00:51:02.580 --> 00:51:06.260
And I think we will go back
to the moon and to Mars

00:51:06.260 --> 00:51:08.660
the second we choose
to do it again.

00:51:08.660 --> 00:51:10.550
We have chosen not to do it.

00:51:10.550 --> 00:51:15.170
I think we are in a position
to be close to doing it again.

00:51:15.170 --> 00:51:17.920
The private industry
is nudging NASA.

00:51:17.920 --> 00:51:20.140
NASA is getting close
to having a new rocket

00:51:20.140 --> 00:51:22.730
and a new spacecraft
that can do it.

00:51:22.730 --> 00:51:25.460
China is a growing
global power, and there

00:51:25.460 --> 00:51:30.890
is nothing that stimulates
American initiative like being

00:51:30.890 --> 00:51:32.390
challenged by somebody.

00:51:32.390 --> 00:51:35.300
So I think we haven't
gone, because we've

00:51:35.300 --> 00:51:36.410
elected not to go.

00:51:36.410 --> 00:51:39.830
And I think we may be at
the threshold of electing

00:51:39.830 --> 00:51:41.120
to go again.

00:51:41.120 --> 00:51:43.370
AUDIENCE: Actually the
follow up question.

00:51:43.370 --> 00:51:47.340
Can you share your
opinion about the chance--

00:51:47.340 --> 00:51:50.950
or do you believe that the
current ongoing mission--

00:51:50.950 --> 00:51:55.490
plan to inhabit Mars by
Elon Musk and [INAUDIBLE]

00:51:55.490 --> 00:51:59.862
will be successful in the
timeline they are suggesting?

00:51:59.862 --> 00:52:01.820
JEFFREY KLUGER: No, I
don't think Elon Musk can

00:52:01.820 --> 00:52:05.720
get to Mars by 2024.

00:52:05.720 --> 00:52:08.360
Elon is a force of nature.

00:52:08.360 --> 00:52:09.830
Elon is a brilliant man.

00:52:09.830 --> 00:52:12.620
I mean, here's a
guy who just said,

00:52:12.620 --> 00:52:15.672
I'm going to build
rockets and electric cars,

00:52:15.672 --> 00:52:16.380
and he's done it.

00:52:16.380 --> 00:52:20.750
I was in his office once
interviewing him, and he has--

00:52:20.750 --> 00:52:22.400
it's a cubicle.

00:52:22.400 --> 00:52:25.740
Biggest cubicle on the floor,
but it's still just a cubicle.

00:52:25.740 --> 00:52:30.350
And he has about seven
books on his shelf.

00:52:30.350 --> 00:52:32.000
And they told me everything.

00:52:32.000 --> 00:52:34.610
Six of them are
technical books that

00:52:34.610 --> 00:52:39.170
are variations on how to build
a rocket ship, and one of them

00:52:39.170 --> 00:52:42.260
is Walter Isaacson's
bio of Albert Einstein.

00:52:42.260 --> 00:52:46.400
I learned everything I needed
to know about Elon from that.

00:52:46.400 --> 00:52:48.410
Elon has done amazing things.

00:52:48.410 --> 00:52:50.750
He is the first person--

00:52:50.750 --> 00:52:52.970
his being able to
orbit a spacecraft

00:52:52.970 --> 00:52:57.730
and bring it back intact to
a safe landing in the ocean--

00:52:57.730 --> 00:53:01.430
he is the only
organization, SpaceX,

00:53:01.430 --> 00:53:04.790
to have done that
apart from a nation,

00:53:04.790 --> 00:53:06.680
apart from another country.

00:53:06.680 --> 00:53:07.460
He did this.

00:53:07.460 --> 00:53:08.509
He set out to do it.

00:53:08.509 --> 00:53:09.800
He's done extraordinary things.

00:53:09.800 --> 00:53:12.130
I think he can get to Mars.

00:53:12.130 --> 00:53:16.430
But boasting that he can
do it by 2024 I think

00:53:16.430 --> 00:53:18.110
is not realistic.

00:53:18.110 --> 00:53:20.870
Saying that he's going
to send a crew of two

00:53:20.870 --> 00:53:24.230
paying astronauts on
a circumlunar flight--

00:53:24.230 --> 00:53:26.630
I think he said 2018--

00:53:26.630 --> 00:53:27.950
I don't think that's doable.

00:53:27.950 --> 00:53:30.920
I do think that's doable in
the very short range, that

00:53:30.920 --> 00:53:32.720
circumlunar mission.

00:53:32.720 --> 00:53:36.020
But I think it won't
happen in 2018.

00:53:36.020 --> 00:53:39.150
And he might beat
the US to Mars.

00:53:39.150 --> 00:53:40.700
He might beat NASA to Mars.

00:53:40.700 --> 00:53:43.550
But 2024 is seven
years from now.

00:53:43.550 --> 00:53:46.190
That is not happening
in seven years.

00:53:46.190 --> 00:53:47.600
I'd love to be proven wrong.

00:53:47.600 --> 00:53:49.250
I would be the
first to say I can't

00:53:49.250 --> 00:53:53.020
believe I misjudged the force
of nature that is Elon Musk.

00:53:53.020 --> 00:53:55.250
But I don't think that will be.

00:53:55.250 --> 00:53:56.780
AUDIENCE: In the
long run, you do

00:53:56.780 --> 00:54:01.082
believe that inhabiting
Mars will happen eventually

00:54:01.082 --> 00:54:01.790
in human history?

00:54:01.790 --> 00:54:03.147
JEFFREY KLUGER: I think it will.

00:54:03.147 --> 00:54:04.980
Again, it's a question
of choosing to do it.

00:54:04.980 --> 00:54:10.430
It's a question of developing
the infrastructure on Mars

00:54:10.430 --> 00:54:14.581
to do it and raising the money
and getting the commitment

00:54:14.581 --> 00:54:15.080
to do it.

00:54:15.080 --> 00:54:17.344
I think that the
International Space Station--

00:54:17.344 --> 00:54:19.010
which like so much
else, everything else

00:54:19.010 --> 00:54:20.930
we built for human
space travel has just

00:54:20.930 --> 00:54:24.290
been round and round and around
the carousel around the Earth--

00:54:24.290 --> 00:54:26.990
I think it provides a very,
very good template for how

00:54:26.990 --> 00:54:30.170
to do these things, because
it's a magnificent engineering

00:54:30.170 --> 00:54:31.190
achievement.

00:54:31.190 --> 00:54:34.940
And it was built,
and it's maintained

00:54:34.940 --> 00:54:37.970
by 18 different countries--
by 15 different countries

00:54:37.970 --> 00:54:41.870
and 18 different
nationalities of astronauts

00:54:41.870 --> 00:54:43.190
have flown aboard it.

00:54:43.190 --> 00:54:46.310
And I think using that
template for Mars,

00:54:46.310 --> 00:54:49.730
you gather innovation from
different parts of the world,

00:54:49.730 --> 00:54:51.740
you share the expense,
you share the work.

00:54:51.740 --> 00:54:54.640
I think that's a
great way to do it.

00:54:54.640 --> 00:54:57.720
AUDIENCE: So in the missions
which effectively didn't

00:54:57.720 --> 00:55:01.590
happen, because we did Apollo
8 the way we did Apollo 8,

00:55:01.590 --> 00:55:04.580
they were there to make
sure that things worked.

00:55:04.580 --> 00:55:08.070
And so they had the
opportunity of going wrong.

00:55:08.070 --> 00:55:10.260
Was there any risk that
we actually seriously

00:55:10.260 --> 00:55:13.620
expected those
missions would avoid

00:55:13.620 --> 00:55:17.400
without necessarily taking
the risk upon themselves that

00:55:17.400 --> 00:55:18.170
was a risk?

00:55:18.170 --> 00:55:21.480
Therefore, we were eliminating
from the program completely as

00:55:21.480 --> 00:55:23.190
opposed to just
deferring it when we

00:55:23.190 --> 00:55:24.630
decided to accelerate Apollo 8.

00:55:24.630 --> 00:55:26.400
Was it just we decided
to pile up all the risks

00:55:26.400 --> 00:55:27.150
and say, we're
going to be taking

00:55:27.150 --> 00:55:28.620
this risk over the
next two years anyway,

00:55:28.620 --> 00:55:29.910
so we may as well do it now?

00:55:29.910 --> 00:55:31.951
JEFFREY KLUGER: There was
a lot of truth in that.

00:55:31.951 --> 00:55:34.770
Apollo's 8 and 9
were both supposed

00:55:34.770 --> 00:55:39.210
to be Earth orbit missions in
which both the Apollo command

00:55:39.210 --> 00:55:42.720
service module and the
lunar module were tested.

00:55:42.720 --> 00:55:45.090
It was not ready in
time for Apollo 8,

00:55:45.090 --> 00:55:46.950
and they didn't
just want to have

00:55:46.950 --> 00:55:49.020
another mission
in low Earth orbit

00:55:49.020 --> 00:55:51.210
with just the command
module, so they decided

00:55:51.210 --> 00:55:54.330
to pile up a lot of
the risks and go off

00:55:54.330 --> 00:55:58.650
to the moon with the
Apollo command module.

00:55:58.650 --> 00:56:00.180
But yes, they had--

00:56:00.180 --> 00:56:03.900
the mission that Frank Borman,
Jim Lovell, and Bill Anders

00:56:03.900 --> 00:56:08.100
were going to fly would
have been a low Earth orbit

00:56:08.100 --> 00:56:09.180
mission with a LEM.

00:56:09.180 --> 00:56:12.120
And they would have
gone up to about 4,000,

00:56:12.120 --> 00:56:14.280
5,000 miles, which would
have been an altitude

00:56:14.280 --> 00:56:18.330
record at that time, and done
a high dive into the atmosphere

00:56:18.330 --> 00:56:20.700
to test the deep space re-entry.

00:56:20.700 --> 00:56:23.070
And that was a critical
thing, and that

00:56:23.070 --> 00:56:27.900
had never been done by human
beings until Apollo 8 happened.

00:56:27.900 --> 00:56:32.460
And you hear about
what a roller coaster

00:56:32.460 --> 00:56:35.130
ride it can be to re-enter
from low-earth orbit.

00:56:35.130 --> 00:56:37.950
It's comparatively easy,
because basically all you're

00:56:37.950 --> 00:56:40.020
doing is tapping the
brakes to slow down

00:56:40.020 --> 00:56:43.830
from 17,000 miles an hour
to ease into the atmosphere.

00:56:43.830 --> 00:56:45.330
Now, that easing
into the atmosphere

00:56:45.330 --> 00:56:48.660
still generates temperatures
of 3,000 degrees

00:56:48.660 --> 00:56:51.840
outside your spacecraft and
subjects you to four to six Gs,

00:56:51.840 --> 00:56:54.390
so none of us would
want to do that.

00:56:54.390 --> 00:56:56.340
But re-entering
from deep space, you

00:56:56.340 --> 00:57:00.256
slam into the atmosphere
at 25,000 miles an hour,

00:57:00.256 --> 00:57:02.130
and you have to ride
sort of a roller coaster

00:57:02.130 --> 00:57:04.800
to come back down to
sort of balance your Gs

00:57:04.800 --> 00:57:06.810
and bleed off your forces.

00:57:06.810 --> 00:57:08.640
And then you have
a higher G-Force,

00:57:08.640 --> 00:57:10.720
and you've got 5,000
degree temperatures.

00:57:10.720 --> 00:57:12.930
So it would have been
awfully nice to have tested

00:57:12.930 --> 00:57:16.030
that a little bit more
before the Apollo 8 crew

00:57:16.030 --> 00:57:17.460
said, yeah, we'll
take that ride.

00:57:17.460 --> 00:57:18.700
We'll see what happens.

00:57:18.700 --> 00:57:22.470
So there were risks,
and they undertook them.

00:57:22.470 --> 00:57:23.370
SPEAKER: Thank you.

00:57:23.370 --> 00:57:24.570
[APPLAUSE]

00:57:24.570 --> 00:57:27.020
JEFFREY KLUGER:
Thank you so much.
