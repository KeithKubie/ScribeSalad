00:00:00.260 --> 00:00:02.260
- [Voiceover] A particle
moves in the xy plane so that

00:00:02.260 --> 00:00:04.615
at any time t is greater
than or equal to zero

00:00:04.615 --> 00:00:07.584
its position vector is,
and they give us the

00:00:07.584 --> 00:00:09.417
x component and the y component

00:00:09.417 --> 00:00:12.108
of our position vectors, and
they're both functions of time.

00:00:12.108 --> 00:00:14.328
What is the particle's acceleration

00:00:14.328 --> 00:00:16.775
vector at time t equals three?

00:00:16.775 --> 00:00:19.170
Alright, so or position, let's denote that

00:00:19.170 --> 00:00:20.924
it's a vector valued function,

00:00:20.924 --> 00:00:22.512
it's gonna be a function of time.

00:00:22.512 --> 00:00:24.016
It is a vector.

00:00:24.016 --> 00:00:26.169
And they already told
us that the x component

00:00:26.169 --> 00:00:29.867
of our position is negative
three t to the third power

00:00:29.867 --> 00:00:33.360
plus four t-squared, and the y component

00:00:33.360 --> 00:00:36.110
is t to the third power plus two.

00:00:37.103 --> 00:00:38.975
And so you give me any time greater than

00:00:38.975 --> 00:00:41.128
or equal to zero, I put it in here

00:00:41.128 --> 00:00:43.930
and I can give you the
corresponding x and y components.

00:00:43.930 --> 00:00:45.389
And this is one form of notation

00:00:45.389 --> 00:00:48.889
for a vector, another way of writing this,

00:00:50.305 --> 00:00:52.498
you might be familiar
with engineering notation.

00:00:52.498 --> 00:00:53.841
It might be written like, or sometimes

00:00:53.841 --> 00:00:55.672
people write this as unit vector notation.

00:00:55.672 --> 00:00:59.213
Negative three to the
third plus four t-squared

00:00:59.213 --> 00:01:02.180
times the unit vector in
the horizontal direction,

00:01:02.180 --> 00:01:06.648
plus t to the third plus
two, times the unit vector

00:01:06.648 --> 00:01:09.090
in the vertical direction.

00:01:09.090 --> 00:01:11.446
This is just denoting the same thing.

00:01:11.446 --> 00:01:13.273
This is the x component,
this is the y component.

00:01:13.273 --> 00:01:14.896
This is the component in
the horizontal direction,

00:01:14.896 --> 00:01:17.092
this is the component in
the vertical direction,

00:01:17.092 --> 00:01:19.166
or the y component.

00:01:19.166 --> 00:01:20.910
Now the key realization is if you have

00:01:20.910 --> 00:01:23.677
the position vector, well
the velocity vector's

00:01:23.677 --> 00:01:25.994
just going to be the derivative of that.

00:01:25.994 --> 00:01:30.161
So V of t is just going to
be equal to r prime of t,

00:01:37.423 --> 00:01:39.782
which is going to be equal to,

00:01:39.782 --> 00:01:41.531
well you just have to
take the corresponding

00:01:41.531 --> 00:01:43.894
derivatives of each of the components.

00:01:43.894 --> 00:01:45.684
So let's do that.

00:01:45.684 --> 00:01:47.475
So if we wanna take the derivative

00:01:47.475 --> 00:01:50.033
of the x component here
with respect to time,

00:01:50.033 --> 00:01:51.867
we're just gonna use
the power rule a bunch.

00:01:51.867 --> 00:01:53.494
So it's three times negative three,

00:01:53.494 --> 00:01:56.077
so it's negative nine t-squared

00:01:56.912 --> 00:01:59.231
and then plus two times four is eight,

00:01:59.231 --> 00:02:01.792
so plus eight t to the first.

00:02:01.792 --> 00:02:03.500
So plus eight t.

00:02:03.500 --> 00:02:07.399
And then over here for the y component.

00:02:07.399 --> 00:02:10.361
So the derivative of t to the third

00:02:10.361 --> 00:02:12.594
with respect to t is three t-squared.

00:02:12.594 --> 00:02:14.344
Three t-squared, and then the derivative

00:02:14.344 --> 00:02:16.341
of two is just a zero, so I actually

00:02:16.341 --> 00:02:18.865
have space to write that
three t-squared even bigger.

00:02:18.865 --> 00:02:21.752
Three t-squared, alright.

00:02:21.752 --> 00:02:24.599
And if we wanna find the
acceleration function,

00:02:24.599 --> 00:02:27.079
or the vector valued function

00:02:27.079 --> 00:02:29.963
that gives us acceleration
as a function of time,

00:02:29.963 --> 00:02:31.384
well that's just going to be

00:02:31.384 --> 00:02:34.225
the derivative of the velocity function

00:02:34.225 --> 00:02:35.894
with respect to time.

00:02:35.894 --> 00:02:37.402
So this is going to be equal to,

00:02:37.402 --> 00:02:39.819
this is going to be equal to,

00:02:40.819 --> 00:02:42.647
let me give myself some space.

00:02:42.647 --> 00:02:45.003
And so the x component, well I just take

00:02:45.003 --> 00:02:48.011
the derivative of the x component again,

00:02:48.011 --> 00:02:50.249
and let me find a color
I haven't used yet,

00:02:50.249 --> 00:02:52.117
I'll use this green, so let's see.

00:02:52.117 --> 00:02:55.855
Two times negative nine, negative 18

00:02:55.855 --> 00:02:58.996
times t to the first power plus eight,

00:02:58.996 --> 00:03:01.123
derivative of eight t is just eight

00:03:01.123 --> 00:03:01.956
if we're taking the derivative

00:03:01.956 --> 00:03:03.066
with respect to t.

00:03:03.066 --> 00:03:06.281
And then here in the orange, derivative of

00:03:06.281 --> 00:03:08.602
three t-squared, so it's
two power rule here,

00:03:08.602 --> 00:03:09.783
over and over again.

00:03:09.783 --> 00:03:14.742
Two times three is six t to
the first power, just six t.

00:03:14.742 --> 00:03:16.937
So this is, we've just been able

00:03:16.937 --> 00:03:19.054
to by taking the derivative of

00:03:19.054 --> 00:03:22.470
this position vector
valued function twice,

00:03:22.470 --> 00:03:25.760
I'm able to find the
acceleration function.

00:03:25.760 --> 00:03:28.768
And now I just have to
evaluate it at t equals three.

00:03:28.768 --> 00:03:32.793
So our acceleration at t is equal to three

00:03:32.793 --> 00:03:36.210
is equal to, so in green it's going to be

00:03:37.753 --> 00:03:41.170
negative eighteen times three plus eight,

00:03:43.727 --> 00:03:46.394
comma, and then we're gonna have

00:03:47.629 --> 00:03:50.379
six times three, six times three.

00:03:52.631 --> 00:03:54.951
And so what does this simplify to?

00:03:54.951 --> 00:03:56.089
Well this is going to be equal to,

00:03:56.089 --> 00:03:59.585
let's see, negative 18 times three is

00:03:59.585 --> 00:04:02.502
negative 54, negative 54 plus eight

00:04:04.425 --> 00:04:05.675
is negative 46.

00:04:06.946 --> 00:04:11.183
Negative 46, and then six
times three is eighteen.

00:04:11.183 --> 00:04:12.690
Did I do that arithmetic right?

00:04:12.690 --> 00:04:16.189
So this is negative 54 plus eight.

00:04:16.189 --> 00:04:19.599
So negative 54 plus four
would be negative 50,

00:04:19.599 --> 00:04:21.549
plus another four would be negative 46.

00:04:21.549 --> 00:04:22.889
Yep, there you have it.

00:04:22.889 --> 00:04:25.222
Negative 46, comma eighteen.

00:04:26.749 --> 00:04:29.332
That is its acceleration vector

00:04:30.208 --> 00:04:32.208
at t is equal to three.
