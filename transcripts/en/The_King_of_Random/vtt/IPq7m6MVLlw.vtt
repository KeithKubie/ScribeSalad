Quick reminder guys

00:00:00.500 --> 00:00:03.360
Check the description for a link to our self made seminar

00:00:03.360 --> 00:00:09.060
It's a three day hands on training event  where we are going to teach you how to make a living making videos at home

00:00:09.340 --> 00:00:11.840
Hey guys I'm Nate welcome back to the King of random

00:00:11.840 --> 00:00:16.600
Today we're gonna be trying an experiment that a lot of you have asked to see we're gonna see what happens if we pour molten aluminum

00:00:16.600 --> 00:00:21.300
Onto dry ice and the opposite and see what happens if you drop some dry ice into some molten aluminum

00:00:23.160 --> 00:00:26.920
We've got our furnace ready to go and we've got a large block of dry ice so let's get some aluminum

00:00:27.070 --> 00:00:30.330
Melting and prep our dry ice to see what will happen

00:00:38.500 --> 00:00:45.360
This is some of the same aluminum cable that we've used in a previous video. It's a pretty cheap source of fairly high-grade aluminum

00:00:45.899 --> 00:00:47.550
Now while our furnace is heating up

00:00:47.550 --> 00:00:52.680
I said I also want to prep our block of dry ice and what I'm going to do is take this drill bit and

00:00:52.930 --> 00:00:56.759
Try and drill a sort of core hole out of the center of it

00:00:56.760 --> 00:01:00.449
I don't want to pour the aluminum on and have it all just flow right off

00:01:00.449 --> 00:01:03.089
I really want it to stay in contact with the dry ice

00:01:03.250 --> 00:01:09.089
So hopefully I'll be able to make a small well in our block of dry ice that our liquid aluminum can sit in

00:01:09.400 --> 00:01:12.389
Let's give it a shot. I've never tried drilling into dry ice before

00:01:17.940 --> 00:01:19.940
Hmm it's not quick

00:01:25.340 --> 00:01:27.910
All right, I think that is a pretty good

00:01:27.910 --> 00:01:30.249
Well that will hold our liquid aluminum nicely

00:01:30.250 --> 00:01:33.069
And it's still at least an inch thick below where I've drilled out

00:01:33.200 --> 00:01:39.820
So we should have a good insulating layer still our drill bit got nice and cold drilling into our block of dry ice

00:01:40.340 --> 00:01:43.990
Looks like our aluminum is just starting to melt inside the crucible now

00:02:01.280 --> 00:02:07.580
I think our aluminum is now pretty well molten and before I take it and pour it into our block of dry ice I also

00:02:07.580 --> 00:02:12.619
Want to try breaking off a small piece of the dry ice and dropping it down into that aluminum?

00:02:12.620 --> 00:02:15.440
I'm not sure how much if at all it will react

00:02:15.440 --> 00:02:19.190
I know that regular ice and molten aluminum can have a sort of explosive effect

00:02:19.190 --> 00:02:22.609
And I am a little concerned about that with the dry ice as well although

00:02:22.610 --> 00:02:28.729
I don't think we'll have that violent of a reaction so our small-scale test of dropping a small piece of dry ice in will involve

00:02:28.730 --> 00:02:32.929
Me being able to be away having some containing walls, so if it does splash

00:02:32.930 --> 00:02:37.459
I'm not in as much danger and overall. I think it'll just be safer to test it out on that scale first

00:02:38.190 --> 00:02:44.570
I've got a small chunk of dry ice let's see what happens if I start by just dropping this little piece into our aluminum

00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:49.100
alright dry ice being dropped into molten aluminum 3 2 1

00:02:52.680 --> 00:02:59.330
It's just kind of floating on top of it, I've got a few more tiny pieces, I'll drop those in too

00:03:02.220 --> 00:03:05.959
I think we are seeing the leidenfrost frost effect in full force

00:03:13.010 --> 00:03:17.020
Splash, let's try this with a slightly larger chunk to see if it makes any difference

00:03:19.760 --> 00:03:21.290
Well it dropped it and

00:03:21.290 --> 00:03:22.240
it fell

00:03:22.240 --> 00:03:27.360
in, I dropped from high enough that it actually fell into the aluminum instead of just sitting on top and it made just sort of

00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:28.640
one

00:03:28.910 --> 00:03:30.230
big bubble

00:03:30.230 --> 00:03:33.640
Sitting on the surface of the aluminum. It's not really going anywhere or doing anything

00:03:34.260 --> 00:03:36.900
But it looks funny, now I'm gonna poke it.

00:03:38.480 --> 00:03:46.090
Oh, it just collapsed it was sort of like an aluminum foil bubble and when I poked it it all just disappeared

00:03:49.220 --> 00:03:51.460
Can still see it just floating on the surface there

00:03:52.840 --> 00:03:58.200
there we go there's our first test seeing what happens if we put a small chunk of dry ice into the molten aluminum

00:03:58.240 --> 00:04:04.020
Now I think it's time. We scale it up and pour a bunch of that molten aluminum down inside our dry ice block

00:04:04.459 --> 00:04:06.459
What do you think is gonna happen?

00:04:11.680 --> 00:04:13.680
And three two one

00:04:21.139 --> 00:04:23.139
That's a cool like

00:04:23.509 --> 00:04:27.879
weird bubble on top of the dry ice thing

00:04:28.639 --> 00:04:30.639
I like that

00:04:31.160 --> 00:04:37.359
We get a lot more emotion pouring the aluminum into the dry ice and then dropping the dry ice into the aluminum

00:04:37.729 --> 00:04:41.169
That is bubbling and spurting and splashing all over. I kind of like that

00:04:41.720 --> 00:04:43.720
Well, it's cool

00:04:45.440 --> 00:04:47.919
It's just kind of floating in there now I think it's

00:04:48.800 --> 00:04:51.910
Formed like a very smooth barrier layer between the two

00:04:53.120 --> 00:04:59.520
Alright I'm not gonna touch it, but I'm gonna put my hand near it to see if I can feel the heat
If there is any heat coming it yeah, there is plenty of heat coming off of that Wow that is toasty in fact

00:05:03.360 --> 00:05:09.760
I mean the dry ice obviously is freezing cold, but right here. There's a lot of warmth coming off of it

00:05:10.250 --> 00:05:13.419
See if it would burn this stick at all or anything yep

00:05:13.970 --> 00:05:15.280
Touch this stick to it

00:05:15.280 --> 00:05:20.139
and it starts smoking pretty quick it might be hard to see in all the fumes and vapors from the dry ice but

00:05:21.560 --> 00:05:23.889
Touch the stick to it, and it starts burning still

00:05:25.030 --> 00:05:27.269
Still a lot of warmth coming off that though

00:05:27.270 --> 00:05:32.729
That's so weird to have my hand this close to dry ice and have it be warming up instead of cooling down

00:05:32.729 --> 00:05:34.729
I put her right here

00:05:34.810 --> 00:05:38.850
I can feel how cold it is, if I put her right here though. They're still warmth just

00:05:39.520 --> 00:05:41.520
Coming up off of that aluminum oh

00:05:45.160 --> 00:05:51.239
There we go there's our aluminum ingot that we've now cast in dry ice

00:05:55.990 --> 00:05:58.949
Still very toasty, it's been sitting in the dry ice

00:06:00.069 --> 00:06:05.549
For several minutes, but it's still hot enough that it's not safe to touch you can actually see that it's starting to

00:06:06.099 --> 00:06:08.878
bury its way into the block of dry ice -

00:06:15.430 --> 00:06:17.430
Doesn't like that

00:06:20.050 --> 00:06:25.409
Well we've still got a divot in our dry ice and we've still got more aluminum in the crucible I say we do it again

00:06:28.150 --> 00:06:30.150
Three two one

00:06:32.960 --> 00:06:35.520
Whoa, that's exciting

00:06:36.800 --> 00:06:41.920
That was cool for a second as I poured it in. It was still glowing orange. Oh

00:06:44.480 --> 00:06:47.040
Fun bubbles

00:06:47.120 --> 00:06:50.200
It kind of reminds me of in Star Wars

00:06:51.040 --> 00:06:54.040
Episode seven when Rey makes her little

00:06:54.870 --> 00:06:55.699
powdered food

00:06:55.699 --> 00:07:00.169
She like adds the water to it and stir it with her finger and like that muffin grows out of it

00:07:00.169 --> 00:07:02.160
It looks kind of like that

00:07:03.080 --> 00:07:03.760
Bloop

00:07:04.720 --> 00:07:05.460
Oh snap

00:07:05.640 --> 00:07:09.220
We've got our camera just the tiny, tiniest bit

00:07:09.720 --> 00:07:11.419
So weird it looks like it's solidified

00:07:11.419 --> 00:07:17.959
But if I poke it it's still soft the tongs are still able to just stab right down into it

00:07:18.360 --> 00:07:20.360
It's like a an

00:07:20.370 --> 00:07:23.630
Aluminum paste, but just because it's so hot still

00:07:25.500 --> 00:07:29.690
All right, we've still got a little bit of aluminum left in our crucible

00:07:30.180 --> 00:07:35.239
So now let's just pour we have left on top of the aluminum. That's already in the dry ice

00:07:36.120 --> 00:07:38.120
here goes

00:07:47.820 --> 00:07:51.830
Hmm, it's not as exciting when it's not in contact with the dry-ice on all sides

00:07:52.400 --> 00:07:59.520
So now it's resting on a bed of warm aluminum instead of touching the dry ice directly, and it's just not very

00:08:00.200 --> 00:08:01.860
reactive now

00:08:01.860 --> 00:08:03.860
I'm gonna pop the bubble now

00:08:07.740 --> 00:08:10.180
Wasn't really popping it was more of just crushing it

00:08:13.020 --> 00:08:13.640
heh

00:08:14.120 --> 00:08:19.340
It's sort of puddled out as it went down into the dry ice so now our ingot is just stuck

00:08:19.520 --> 00:08:21.520
In the block of dry ice

00:08:21.920 --> 00:08:22.640
Oh!

00:08:23.240 --> 00:08:25.240
We've actually managed to go all the way through

00:08:27.380 --> 00:08:29.380
There it is, ha!

00:08:30.080 --> 00:08:34.940
So here is our ingot of aluminum that we poured on top of more aluminum

00:08:36.120 --> 00:08:36.620
nice

00:08:37.140 --> 00:08:39.300
curved round edges to that

00:08:40.080 --> 00:08:42.080
And then our dry ice brick

00:08:42.120 --> 00:08:45.410
Which we've just melted a hole right through with our aluminum

00:08:45.810 --> 00:08:50.000
There we have it a little bit of dry ice dropped into molten aluminum, which wasn't very reactive

00:08:50.000 --> 00:08:53.840
But the molten aluminum poured into the dry ice I thought looked really cool

00:08:53.910 --> 00:08:59.420
We had a nice little well that I drilled into the dry ice block and that did a really good job of containing the molten

00:08:59.420 --> 00:09:03.979
Aluminum I think all of that cold fighting with all of that heat was pretty fun

00:09:03.980 --> 00:09:08.300
We had a lot of really good bubbling action it seemed like the aluminum would bubble up

00:09:08.300 --> 00:09:12.889
And then maybe it would just get too hot and collapse back down or get too thin walled and just break

00:09:12.900 --> 00:09:17.300
But we had a lot of rising and falling of the bubbles in the aluminum, which looked really cool

00:09:17.300 --> 00:09:20.719
And we managed to melt a hole all the way through our block of dry ice

00:09:20.940 --> 00:09:26.720
We've got a couple of aluminum ingots that we managed to pour into the dry ice block overall this was pretty fun

00:09:26.750 --> 00:09:27.740
I didn't know what to expect

00:09:27.740 --> 00:09:33.230
I've never poured liquid metal into a block of dry ice before but it turned out pretty well

00:09:33.230 --> 00:09:35.929
And it splashed and splattered a little bit

00:09:35.930 --> 00:09:41.300
but it wasn't an explosive super dangerous amount of reaction for the most part it just

00:09:41.880 --> 00:09:42.830
Spurred it a little bit

00:09:42.830 --> 00:09:48.290
and I was wearing thick leather gloves ahead my glasses on I would have long sleeves on and I was able to back away as

00:09:48.290 --> 00:09:52.909
Soon as I poured it in so I felt pretty safe the whole time even though a little tiny splash of aluminum

00:09:52.980 --> 00:09:56.209
Did jump up and stick to the front of one of our cameras

00:09:57.060 --> 00:10:02.600
This was a really fun idea and we tried it because there were a ton of different people who requested it down in the comments

00:10:02.600 --> 00:10:06.589
So if you've got a cool experiment you want to see us do let us know down in the comments

00:10:06.590 --> 00:10:07.640
And we might just film it

00:10:07.640 --> 00:10:12.530
Thanks for joining us for this video today and remember to come gear yourself up with products and merch at thekingofrandom.com

00:10:12.530 --> 00:10:14.530
See you there

00:10:16.350 --> 00:10:17.880
Kind of stuck

00:10:17.880 --> 00:10:20.419
Somehow we have managed to fuse aluminum

00:10:21.180 --> 00:10:23.720
To its steel Pan. I don't think that's going out

00:10:24.900 --> 00:10:25.760
