00:00:46.960 --> 00:00:50.320
Hello,  I'm the Nostalgia Critic. I remember it, so you don't have to.

00:00:50.320 --> 00:00:52.640
Stop! Nope! Reshoot! Reshoot!

00:00:52.740 --> 00:00:54.900
Christ! What are you guys doing here?

00:00:54.900 --> 00:00:56.620
The chart says we need to redo the review.

00:00:57.080 --> 00:00:58.440
On whose authority?

00:00:58.440 --> 00:01:00.440
D.C., the Department of Cameos.

00:01:00.440 --> 00:01:03.500
Remember when you made the trailer for this review? The one with the pop song?

00:01:03.500 --> 00:01:07.540
You mean the one I was told to do like another comic book trailer that may or may not have a talking raccoon in it?

00:01:07.540 --> 00:01:08.820
We can't confirm nor deny that.

00:01:08.820 --> 00:01:12.020
Well, it was a big hit, and we need to add more comedy.

00:01:12.020 --> 00:01:15.100
You're changing halfway just because a competitor is doing better?

00:01:15.100 --> 00:01:17.980
Well, D.C. is usually a few months behind.

00:01:18.980 --> 00:01:19.660
Years.

00:01:20.100 --> 00:01:20.720
Decades.

00:01:21.020 --> 00:01:22.520
It's okay, we're doing it for the fans.

00:01:23.020 --> 00:01:23.520
Doing what?

00:01:23.520 --> 00:01:24.960
Cutting out what they like the most.

00:01:24.960 --> 00:01:26.720
Let's go GOP on this sucker!

00:01:26.720 --> 00:01:29.880
Now, since we're incorporating more humor, obviously, we have to drop the clown.

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:31.680
Well, that goes without saying.

00:01:31.780 --> 00:01:33.560
Oh, I wouldn't do that.

00:01:33.560 --> 00:01:34.140
Why not?

00:01:34.140 --> 00:01:34.740
Hi there.

00:01:34.960 --> 00:01:39.840
Ah, yeah. Jim's been playing Joker off-set like Jared Leto did on the movie.

00:01:40.200 --> 00:01:42.740
Oh, by the way, here ya go.

00:01:42.940 --> 00:01:46.140
What? Yeah, he mails this shit like Leto too,

00:01:46.140 --> 00:01:48.540
because the real Joker would do that.

00:01:49.300 --> 00:01:52.980
Oh look! Anal beads. Just like the real master of crime.

00:01:52.980 --> 00:01:55.900
How is this even funny? The Joker is supposed to be funny.

00:01:56.040 --> 00:01:56.680
Knock, Knock.

00:01:56.680 --> 00:01:57.220
Who's there?

00:01:57.300 --> 00:01:58.560
You're holding anal beads.

00:01:58.560 --> 00:02:02.220
*Maniacal Laughter*

00:02:02.220 --> 00:02:05.360
Your authentic grills are falling out.

00:02:05.360 --> 00:02:07.500
Well, I'm a man of many surprises.

00:02:07.840 --> 00:02:10.300
You sure they aren't just plastic teeth?

00:02:10.300 --> 00:02:12.540
I'm a man of many surprises! Okay, Christ!

00:02:12.540 --> 00:02:15.580
*Maniacal Laughter*

00:02:16.680 --> 00:02:17.300
*Maniacal Laughter*

00:02:17.300 --> 00:02:18.980
Listen, Jim.

00:02:18.980 --> 00:02:20.600
Jim? Who's Jim?

00:02:20.600 --> 00:02:21.920
Sounds like a handsome guy.

00:02:22.700 --> 00:02:23.660
Joker.

00:02:26.220 --> 00:02:28.960
Jared Leto playing Joker?

00:02:28.960 --> 00:02:30.380
Yesssss?

00:02:30.380 --> 00:02:31.340
I'm going to have to call him that every time.

00:02:31.340 --> 00:02:32.800
You are going to have to call him that every time, yeah.

00:02:32.800 --> 00:02:40.400
Listen, we appreciate that you're trying to create buzz, but doesn't the Joker murder people and blow up buildings?

00:02:40.860 --> 00:02:42.500
Yeah, but that's like...dangerous.

00:02:42.500 --> 00:02:44.340
I'd rather just pretend that stuff.

00:02:44.340 --> 00:02:46.240
Oh, just like the real Joker. Yeah....

00:02:46.480 --> 00:02:54.800
So, while you're pretending to do that other stuff, why don't you also "pretend" that you're doing this second-grader-discovering-what-a-troll-is shtick?

00:02:56.280 --> 00:02:57.920
Well, I....

00:02:57.920 --> 00:03:01.040
...Wouldn't be able to act like an asshole for no reason?

00:03:01.040 --> 00:03:02.720
Oh! Just like the real Jared Leto.

00:03:02.760 --> 00:03:03.320
No, no...

00:03:03.600 --> 00:03:08.000
Yeah. So that's totally justified. I'm deeper than I thought.

00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:10.040
Which I can also say for those anal beads.

00:03:11.200 --> 00:03:12.900
Scooby-dooby-doo!

00:03:13.760 --> 00:03:15.960
Cut him out. You can cut him out all you want.

00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:18.880
Agreed, though we're also going to have to redo the opening credits.

00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:19.980
What? How?

00:03:20.880 --> 00:03:30.400
*Hard rock music*

00:03:30.660 --> 00:03:32.800
Hey, alright. That ain't half bad.

00:03:32.800 --> 00:03:35.520
Nothing says, "dark and gritty movie" like bright and neon.

00:03:35.520 --> 00:03:38.540
Alright, well this is getting me hyped up. I'm ready for action.

00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:44.220
Negative. Our chart shows that some people prefer it when you sit at a desk and do nothing.

00:03:44.220 --> 00:03:50.780
Oh, come on. Who would want to start Suicide Squad with someone just sitting down for twenty minutes, just talking about the main characters.

00:03:52.120 --> 00:03:56.820
So, we start Suicide Squad with someone sitting down for twenty minutes just talking about the main characters.

00:03:56.840 --> 00:03:59.340
Her name is Amanda. Played by Viola Davis

00:03:59.640 --> 00:04:03.000
She's an intelligence officer with an idea so insane, it's just crazy enough not to work.

00:04:03.620 --> 00:04:06.860
Who do we call when the next Superman comes to take us out?

00:04:07.040 --> 00:04:07.800
Wonder Woman.

00:04:07.800 --> 00:04:08.300
No.

00:04:08.300 --> 00:04:08.900
The Flash.

00:04:08.900 --> 00:04:09.400
No.

00:04:09.400 --> 00:04:10.020
Aquaman.

00:04:10.060 --> 00:04:10.560
No!

00:04:10.620 --> 00:04:11.200
Cyborg.

00:04:11.200 --> 00:04:11.700
No.

00:04:11.820 --> 00:04:12.520
Batman.

00:04:12.560 --> 00:04:13.060
No

00:04:13.200 --> 00:04:14.000
LEGO Batman.

00:04:14.000 --> 00:04:16.280
How about the villains those heroes fought?

00:04:16.980 --> 00:04:18.160
Hmm... Nope.

00:04:19.420 --> 00:04:21.720
*Hard rock music*

00:04:21.720 --> 00:04:25.460
No, no. Even though that would arguably save hundreds of lives, that's not what happens.

00:04:26.060 --> 00:04:27.900
They actually hear her out.

00:04:27.900 --> 00:04:31.500
If another person as strong as Superman comes, we have to be ready.

00:04:31.500 --> 00:04:35.320
Are you seriously telling me that supervillains will do less harm than Superman?

00:04:36.180 --> 00:04:40.220
Did you forget how good Metropolis looked after Superman saved it from Zod?

00:04:40.220 --> 00:04:41.060
Okay, you have a point.

00:04:41.060 --> 00:04:42.160
Let's look at these crazies.

00:04:44.120 --> 00:04:46.120
Our first mugshot is Deadshot.

00:04:47.740 --> 00:04:51.340
Deadliest assassin around and possible savior of Will Smith's career.

00:04:51.820 --> 00:04:56.280
It also turns out he has a daughter who knows how to play peacekeeper when he pisses off the wrong people.

00:04:59.740 --> 00:05:01.100
It's over, Deadpool.

00:05:01.180 --> 00:05:02.080
Deadshot!

00:05:02.500 --> 00:05:04.960
Oh, well this movie got a lot less cool.

00:05:05.980 --> 00:05:08.280
Oh, please.

00:05:08.500 --> 00:05:09.840
No!!!

00:05:09.840 --> 00:05:16.380
Killing him won't solve anything. It will just turn you into a cold hearted monster that any decent human being would immediately lose affection for.

00:05:17.900 --> 00:05:19.720
Yeah, well, that's never stopped me before.

00:05:19.720 --> 00:05:22.140
Now move out of the way kid, I'm gonna shoot your daddy.

00:05:22.140 --> 00:05:23.620
I was talking to him. Not you!

00:05:23.620 --> 00:05:29.060
Oh sorry! Usually when people are angry about a costumed man killing people. It's about me.

00:05:29.600 --> 00:05:30.900
You win, kid.

00:05:33.300 --> 00:05:36.220
Oh, but I wanted to kill him.

00:05:37.820 --> 00:05:40.220
*Fires gun* I'm Batman.

00:05:40.380 --> 00:05:42.940
Next on our list is Captain Boomerang.

00:05:42.940 --> 00:05:45.660
He's pretty much Rocksteady from Ninja Turtles before he was a rhino.

00:05:47.020 --> 00:05:49.980
His super power, you guessed it, boomerang.

00:05:52.100 --> 00:05:56.260
You're going to take down the next Superman with a boomerang?

00:05:56.260 --> 00:05:58.100
Admittedly, it does sound stupid.

00:05:58.140 --> 00:05:59.420
Amazingly stupid.

00:05:59.420 --> 00:06:01.980
But you'll be distracted when I tell you the Flash is in this movie.

00:06:02.980 --> 00:06:03.480
Hello.

00:06:08.660 --> 00:06:11.280
Oh, what is that disgusting reptilian beast?

00:06:11.280 --> 00:06:14.960
That's the reason people are gonna have to call us "Academy-Award-winning-Suicide Squad".

00:06:15.380 --> 00:06:18.480
Our ticket to Best Makeup over Star Trek film for some reason.

00:06:19.620 --> 00:06:22.620
The scaly wonder himself. The croc.

00:06:26.620 --> 00:06:27.540
I'm a dinosaur.

00:06:32.960 --> 00:06:34.560
Next is Diablo.

00:06:34.920 --> 00:06:37.320
Who can create fire and has sworn off violence

00:06:38.120 --> 00:06:41.080
But we're saving his backstory for later. So we'll just skip him for now.

00:06:42.880 --> 00:06:45.220
Harley Quinn, the Joker's girlfriend.

00:06:48.680 --> 00:06:50.280
What's her superpower?

00:06:50.380 --> 00:06:51.520
Fanservice.

00:06:51.720 --> 00:06:56.800
*random fans exclaiming "Oh my god that is so hot. Oh my god so hot." *

00:06:56.940 --> 00:06:58.680
She used to be Doctor Harleen Quinzel.

00:06:58.900 --> 00:07:01.160
She was assigned to the clown himself.

00:07:01.160 --> 00:07:04.120
He got inside her mind and made her a dangerous killing machine.

00:07:04.400 --> 00:07:08.980
*Obnoxious laughing*

00:07:09.060 --> 00:07:12.060
Okay, are you reading her criminal record or her trading card?

00:07:13.380 --> 00:07:14.020
Oh, um.

00:07:14.180 --> 00:07:16.180
Oh, I guess her trading card..

00:07:16.320 --> 00:07:19.620
Well, what does her criminal record say about how she can help us?

00:07:19.880 --> 00:07:21.920
Um, she has a mallet.

00:07:21.960 --> 00:07:23.140
Okay, last one.

00:07:24.080 --> 00:07:26.780
Okay, last one, the Enchantress.

00:07:29.180 --> 00:07:32.840
A young doctor went exploring in a cave and got possessed by an evil witch.

00:07:35.480 --> 00:07:38.260
She wants to take over the world and may have the power to do so.

00:07:38.260 --> 00:07:41.960
Under our control though, she is the most powerful thing alive.

00:07:46.320 --> 00:07:48.080
And...that's all you need.

00:07:48.220 --> 00:07:48.800
What?

00:07:48.800 --> 00:07:53.100
The Enchantress. That's all you need. You can chunk the rest of that binder into the garbage.

00:07:53.100 --> 00:07:55.240
Hey. I worked hard to find the worst of the worst.

00:07:55.240 --> 00:08:00.320
And you came across boomerangs, mallets, guns, a petting zoo, and a guy who makes fire who no longer makes fire.

00:08:00.440 --> 00:08:03.380
This is all you need. All your attention should be on her.

00:08:03.900 --> 00:08:07.820
He's right! We don't need to worry about them as long as we have that witch under control.

00:08:07.820 --> 00:08:11.460
Yeah. What, do you got her under lockdown or military surveillance?

00:08:11.660 --> 00:08:12.520
Better.

00:08:12.520 --> 00:08:15.460
We have one guy looking after her in a hotel room.

00:08:18.000 --> 00:08:20.560
That's clearly not enough!

00:08:20.600 --> 00:08:21.960
What are you, a moron?

00:08:22.360 --> 00:08:25.560
I can assure you it's okay. I can call to prove it.

00:08:27.540 --> 00:08:29.400
*Cell phone rings*

00:08:29.940 --> 00:08:35.260
Oh, hi Colonel, Amanda here. I was just wondering how...What's that?

00:08:36.360 --> 00:08:38.400
Oh. Uh huh.

00:08:38.740 --> 00:08:42.440
Oh, pssh, just let me know how that works out.

00:08:46.960 --> 00:08:49.400
So it appears she's escaped.

00:08:50.780 --> 00:08:55.960
Who would've known a person that's bent on taking over the world, will try to rule the world.

00:08:58.940 --> 00:09:07.360
While that's going on, one of the particularly mean security guards, played by Ike Barinholtz, is given a surprise visit in his off time by Mr. J.

00:09:07.560 --> 00:09:10.720
I can't wait to show you my toys.

00:09:10.840 --> 00:09:13.440
I know. You mailed me your anal beads last week.

00:09:13.660 --> 00:09:20.420
That was the old me. The new me wants to show you my actual scary toys.

00:09:20.780 --> 00:09:22.080
We're not gonna see them, are we?

00:09:22.080 --> 00:09:22.780
No, that scene's been cut.

00:09:22.980 --> 00:09:23.480
Ah.

00:09:23.800 --> 00:09:24.820
As well as this scene.

00:09:24.860 --> 00:09:25.480
Of course.

00:09:25.480 --> 00:09:28.860
But that doesn't mean that I can't hurt you off screen.

00:09:30.760 --> 00:09:32.800
Critic? Critic!

00:09:32.860 --> 00:09:35.540
Oh knock it off Jim! And let Walter go.

00:09:35.580 --> 00:09:39.940
But I thought about what you've said, Critic. That I need to get more psychotic to get into character.

00:09:39.940 --> 00:09:44.140
In fact, if you look under your desk, you might find another present that I've left for you.

00:09:44.140 --> 00:09:45.360
Oh, Christ.

00:09:48.440 --> 00:09:51.880
A dead mouse. Oh yeah, you're really upping your game there.

00:09:51.880 --> 00:09:53.360
Well, not just any dead mouse.

00:09:53.360 --> 00:09:57.680
Doesn't it look a little familiar? Like a certain pet you have at home?

00:09:58.020 --> 00:10:03.540
Ah! Mrs. Brisbee! I'll kill you! I'll kill you you son of a bitch! You're gonna pay for that!

00:10:03.540 --> 00:10:05.640
Oh, by the way, give this to my girlfriend. You can keep the knife.

00:10:05.860 --> 00:10:06.620
What knife?

00:10:06.620 --> 00:10:10.680
*Scream with maniacal laughter*

00:10:11.240 --> 00:10:12.780
Now that's a knife.

00:10:12.780 --> 00:10:15.060
The guard does however, come through on his promise.

00:10:15.680 --> 00:10:18.120
Here, your douche of a boyfriend said to give you that.

00:10:19.240 --> 00:10:24.720
Aw. How sweet. You're in so much trouble.

00:10:25.520 --> 00:10:30.320
Trouble? Big trouble? What kind of trouble?

00:10:30.360 --> 00:10:32.300
What's gonna happen to me?!

00:10:33.780 --> 00:10:34.700
Nothing happens to him.

00:10:34.700 --> 00:10:37.720
Yeah. He disappears from the film altogether, in fact.

00:10:37.720 --> 00:10:40.280
Ah, another one of our brilliant cuts.

00:10:40.280 --> 00:10:42.560
We fizzled that dizzle. Foshizzle.

00:10:42.560 --> 00:10:43.660
My bizzle. Mm.

00:10:43.860 --> 00:10:48.260
Yeah, but literally any payoff would've worked here. No matter how tiny.

00:10:48.820 --> 00:10:55.600
The Joker could blow up his home. Or take him out while on a run. Or since he's fond of mailing things, he could get this in the mail.

00:10:56.900 --> 00:10:59.060
Noooooo!!!!!!

00:10:59.060 --> 00:11:01.540
It takes less than a day to shoot any of those.

00:11:01.540 --> 00:11:04.620
You don't understand, Critic. We're doing it for the fans.

00:11:04.620 --> 00:11:07.020
Yeah, you keep saying that. What does that excuse mean?

00:11:07.040 --> 00:11:09.820
It means we don't have to explain that much because the fans already know.

00:11:10.160 --> 00:11:12.500
Like look at this character on their mission.

00:11:13.600 --> 00:11:17.420
I am Katana and my sword holds the souls of the enemies that I kill with it.

00:11:17.420 --> 00:11:19.000
Here's a clip of me doing stuff with it.

00:11:19.000 --> 00:11:22.140
*Sword "Shing" Sound Effects*

00:11:22.260 --> 00:11:22.760
Ooh.

00:11:24.720 --> 00:11:26.680
You see? That's all they need to know.

00:11:26.780 --> 00:11:30.760
No...you got her stats and backstory down, but we don't know her.

00:11:31.040 --> 00:11:34.540
What's her personality, interests, dislikes, character traits?

00:11:34.540 --> 00:11:39.460
It's not like say an X-Files movie where the characters are already established in the TV show.

00:11:39.460 --> 00:11:42.840
This is a different interpretation that needs to be established.

00:11:42.840 --> 00:11:45.720
Look, I know our competitors--who may or may not have a talking raccoon--

00:11:45.720 --> 00:11:48.920
give their characters individual movies and then put them together into one.

00:11:48.920 --> 00:11:52.740
That makes audiences understand them better and cheer for them when they come together...

00:11:54.700 --> 00:11:56.820
...I totally forgot where I was going with this.

00:11:56.960 --> 00:12:00.180
However, our fans don't need that because they've got the comics!

00:12:00.840 --> 00:12:06.680
Gandalf would be so much stronger if they replaced him with a Lord of the Rings paperback and said "Come on, you know this guy, right?"

00:12:07.100 --> 00:12:11.760
In fact, we've even been toying with the idea of replacing every character in this movie with recommended issue numbers.

00:12:11.760 --> 00:12:15.720
That way they can read up on the characters and we don't even have to write them.

00:12:15.800 --> 00:12:22.320
So while you may think "for the fans" means lazy, we like to think it means..

00:12:22.340 --> 00:12:23.220
not that.

00:12:25.400 --> 00:12:27.440
Name one personality trait of Katana.

00:12:27.440 --> 00:12:28.940
Oh, I dont know. I don't read comics.

00:12:31.320 --> 00:12:36.340
So, the guy watching the Enchantress, who also happens to be in love with her, is Rick Flag.

00:12:36.340 --> 00:12:43.160
This guy is like Ford, the main character in Godzilla, in that he is so forgettable that you don't even realize this isn't even ford from Godzilla.

00:12:43.280 --> 00:12:44.060
This is.

00:12:44.060 --> 00:12:48.080
Because he can pretty much be switched out with anyone, I'm just gonna play his part.

00:12:48.180 --> 00:12:49.560
You? Why you?

00:12:49.560 --> 00:12:52.800
Because if characters can be introduced without rhyme or reason, then why can't I be one?

00:12:53.320 --> 00:12:58.000
He's tricked by the Enchantress to break out of Amanda's control along with her resurrected brother.

00:12:58.000 --> 00:13:00.660
This calls for the most unqualified people in the world.

00:13:05.180 --> 00:13:09.140
So he leads his team of villains to stop the Enchantress from taking over the world and...

00:13:09.260 --> 00:13:12.360
Wait a minute. How come I didn't get any bright credits or backstory?

00:13:12.920 --> 00:13:16.300
Oh, uhmm, I don't know.

00:13:16.300 --> 00:13:18.720
What, the Native American guy doesn't get any attention?

00:13:18.860 --> 00:13:21.900
Oh, no. Nothing like that.

00:13:24.400 --> 00:13:26.320
I'm just here to die, aren't I?

00:13:26.480 --> 00:13:29.320
No no no no no no.

00:13:29.380 --> 00:13:31.120
Yes, it is. Yes, it is.

00:13:31.120 --> 00:13:35.320
You're gonna use the remote in that hand to blow up the chip inside my head.

00:13:35.320 --> 00:13:37.860
Hey hey hey. Everybody has a chip inside their head, okay?

00:13:37.860 --> 00:13:40.980
If you try to escape, you die. I'm not singling anyone out.

00:13:41.360 --> 00:13:43.000
I think he's lying. I think you should give it a shot.

00:13:43.000 --> 00:13:45.480
Di..did you hear that?! He's trying to kill me!

00:13:45.480 --> 00:13:48.140
DISCOUNT SOKKA HERE is trying to KILL ME!

00:13:48.200 --> 00:13:51.000
For God's sake, you're not just here to die!

00:13:52.120 --> 00:13:53.160
What's my name?

00:13:54.380 --> 00:13:57.340
Uhmmmmm....

00:13:57.340 --> 00:13:59.720
Spirit Iron Knife?

00:13:59.720 --> 00:14:01.140
Thunderhawk?

00:14:01.140 --> 00:14:02.520
Nightwolf.

00:14:02.520 --> 00:14:04.600
Cleveland Redshirt.

00:14:04.820 --> 00:14:06.760
The lawyer from Jurassic Park.

00:14:06.760 --> 00:14:10.400
You know what, screw you guys. I'm not dying for any of you assholes.

00:14:10.400 --> 00:14:13.780
Alright. Fine, I'll dismantle your chip out of white guilt.

00:14:21.360 --> 00:14:23.000
Who the hell had another remote?

00:14:23.000 --> 00:14:26.260
You know, you're right. Killing people really helps me get into character.

00:14:26.360 --> 00:14:28.500
Who would've thought it was so inspiring?

00:14:28.500 --> 00:14:31.440
Damn it, Jim! You are a real asshole. Stop killing my cast!

00:14:31.560 --> 00:14:33.980
Don't blame me. Blame the character.

00:14:34.680 --> 00:14:37.920
*Maniacal laughter*

00:14:38.060 --> 00:14:44.220
I know it's a risky method and people probably won't like me for it, but I thought the sacrifice was worth it for the character.

00:14:44.220 --> 00:14:45.500
Now what are you doing?

00:14:45.500 --> 00:14:49.460
That's the whole reason why I'm doing this. So I can gloat to reporters about how awesome I am.

00:14:49.460 --> 00:14:50.240
Get outta here!

00:14:50.860 --> 00:14:53.480
What do you think about people claiming you're only doing this for attention?

00:14:53.560 --> 00:14:54.600
They're right.

00:15:20.260 --> 00:15:23.920
So, the Suicide Squad make their way to the Enchantress.

00:15:24.720 --> 00:15:27.740
They enter an office building to discover the Enchantress' minions...

00:15:28.480 --> 00:15:29.320
Putties.

00:15:33.220 --> 00:15:36.580
I know they're not technically putties, but they look like them, sound like them.

00:15:36.580 --> 00:15:39.240
And people don't realize how surprisingly easy they are to kill.

00:15:41.100 --> 00:15:45.500
Wow. Power Rangers would be a lot shorter if they just shot people.

00:15:45.500 --> 00:15:46.420
We're not so lucky.

00:15:46.420 --> 00:15:51.520
Alright squad, let's fight like we don't have comfortable careers to fall back on if this movie doesn't do well.

00:15:51.820 --> 00:15:55.160
Wait a minute! I don't think this is dark enough.

00:15:55.160 --> 00:15:58.120
Oh. You mean like there needs to be more twisted characters or plotlines?

00:15:58.320 --> 00:16:00.320
No.... *Claps*

00:16:01.540 --> 00:16:03.300
Ah. Much better.

00:16:03.300 --> 00:16:04.460
Now fight!

00:16:04.720 --> 00:16:06.980
*Battle cries*

00:16:10.780 --> 00:16:14.200
Where are you, you little stinkers? Get over here I can't see you!

00:16:14.840 --> 00:16:18.300
Why would you want to shoot a fight scene in the dark?! Don't people want to see the action?

00:16:18.300 --> 00:16:22.860
Again, Critic. The less we give people, the more they can fill in what's good about it.

00:16:22.860 --> 00:16:26.440
You wouldn't understand, Critic. "It's for the fans."
(Critic simultaneously mocking)

00:16:26.440 --> 00:16:28.780
I got it. Well, Christ, there's gotta be a way around this.

00:16:31.120 --> 00:16:34.840
Wait a minute. And then there's Harley Quinn!

00:16:34.840 --> 00:16:37.160
Oh. That's much better!

00:16:39.940 --> 00:16:41.620
And then there's Katana!

00:16:43.440 --> 00:16:44.340
Arigato.

00:16:46.880 --> 00:16:49.260
The professor and Mary Anne!

00:16:50.820 --> 00:16:52.260
Hey! Thanks!

00:16:55.300 --> 00:16:56.320
Bye bye!

00:16:57.500 --> 00:16:59.600
As you can see, Harley goes in the elevator.

00:17:02.640 --> 00:17:05.140
Oh! Do-si-do.

00:17:15.800 --> 00:17:16.720
Hi guys.

00:17:18.400 --> 00:17:19.760
Well, come on.

00:17:22.420 --> 00:17:24.580
Why you all look at her like that?

00:17:24.800 --> 00:17:26.000
She fought 'em off.

00:17:26.500 --> 00:17:27.920
Yeah, that's what she does.

00:17:28.620 --> 00:17:33.060
That's what we hired her to do. Why would we bring her if she couldn't fight anyone off?

00:17:33.060 --> 00:17:34.340
Fanservice? Fanservice.

00:17:34.340 --> 00:17:36.260
I'm gonna have to say fanservice.

00:17:37.580 --> 00:17:39.500
Come on, It's "for the fans".

00:17:42.480 --> 00:17:43.360
Come on, get in there man!

00:17:43.360 --> 00:17:45.180
This isn't my fight!

00:17:45.380 --> 00:17:46.640
You gotta stand for something.

00:17:47.080 --> 00:17:50.640
So Diablo isn't fighting, but Deadshot and Boomerang try to convince him to.

00:17:50.640 --> 00:17:51.780
Don't touch me!

00:17:51.780 --> 00:17:55.500
Oh, you don't want me to touch you. Oh, look I'm touching you, I'm touching you.

00:17:55.940 --> 00:18:00.000
But Deadshot doesn't realize it can take years to transform a man whose sworn off violence--

00:18:00.220 --> 00:18:08.120
*Angrily screaming*

00:18:12.400 --> 00:18:15.120
Wow, that took like nothing.

00:18:15.540 --> 00:18:16.420
Yeah, I know.

00:18:16.420 --> 00:18:20.280
Is that really all it took to get you back into violence?

00:18:20.460 --> 00:18:21.340
I don't know.

00:18:21.340 --> 00:18:24.500
Years of pacifism destroyed by tapping on your head?

00:18:24.500 --> 00:18:26.380
I just don't like people touching my head, okay?

00:18:26.380 --> 00:18:27.340
It's annoying!

00:18:27.820 --> 00:18:31.200
Well, we "appreciate" your sacrifice.

00:18:31.200 --> 00:18:33.060
Yeah, it's like one of those guys going vegan for a day.

00:18:33.060 --> 00:18:34.820
I know right? Pussy.

00:18:38.040 --> 00:18:39.220
About time you got here.

00:18:39.220 --> 00:18:43.040
Oh, right. They first had to save Amanda from being destroyed by the Enchantress' wrath.

00:18:44.100 --> 00:18:48.320
And you wouldn't have made it here without them. Admit it, Rick. I was right.

00:18:52.080 --> 00:18:53.560
Say that again.

00:18:54.220 --> 00:18:55.480
I was right.

00:18:55.820 --> 00:18:57.760
About the Suicide Squad.

00:19:00.200 --> 00:19:02.120
You were right...?

00:19:02.240 --> 00:19:03.300
Oh, yes..

00:19:04.940 --> 00:19:07.980
You...were...right...

00:19:08.420 --> 00:19:09.780
You were right?

00:19:10.880 --> 00:19:17.620
You were....that Enchant-bitch out there. The one that's destroying the city. I'm sure you're aware of her!

00:19:17.620 --> 00:19:21.082
She was a part of a certain team. A super team.

00:19:21.082 --> 00:19:22.040
Am I correct?

00:19:23.360 --> 00:19:24.080
Uh...yeah.

00:19:24.400 --> 00:19:31.280
Uh-huh. And uh, there was a name, a name for this certain team if I recall that that you gave it, correct?!

00:19:32.340 --> 00:19:32.840
Yeah.

00:19:34.100 --> 00:19:38.940
And...what was the name of that team, again? The one that you gave. I can't remember.

00:19:40.020 --> 00:19:41.160
*Mumbling* Suicide Squad.

00:19:41.160 --> 00:19:41.660
What was it again?

00:19:42.680 --> 00:19:44.180
*Mumbling a little louder* Suicide Squad.

00:19:44.180 --> 00:19:45.680
Still didn't get it.

00:19:45.960 --> 00:19:47.300
Suicide Squad.

00:19:47.300 --> 00:19:50.420
WAIT a minute! That can't be it!

00:19:50.420 --> 00:19:53.980
Because she's part of the team you were RIGHT ABOUT!

00:19:54.620 --> 00:19:59.620
So....correct me if I'm wrong, 
but if this dream team was never put together,

00:19:59.620 --> 00:20:03.840
the one you were right about,
 none of this bullshit would be happening!

00:20:04.120 --> 00:20:05.720
I'd be in bed right now.

00:20:06.620 --> 00:20:11.740
It's almost like all of this is entirely your goddamn fault!

00:20:12.440 --> 00:20:13.160
*Quietly* Right?

00:20:14.700 --> 00:20:15.760
*Quietly* Right?!

00:20:17.060 --> 00:20:21.300
If you have the Suicide Squad 
and she's a PART of the Suicide Squad,

00:20:21.300 --> 00:20:22.600
and she has a death beam...

00:20:23.220 --> 00:20:26.140
here it is...here's the death beam. Here she is...all the way over here.

00:20:26.720 --> 00:20:31.380
Her death beam reaches... acrooooss...the room

00:20:31.460 --> 00:20:34.300
And nukes your Suicide Squad.

00:20:34.840 --> 00:20:37.940
I. Drink. Your. Milkshake. *Slurps*

00:20:38.120 --> 00:20:39.120
I drink it up!

00:20:39.320 --> 00:20:40.660
THIS WAS STUPID!

00:20:41.020 --> 00:20:42.380
This whole IDEA was stupid!

00:20:42.380 --> 00:20:46.000
Even LEGO BATMAN said it was stupid and that's a KIDS' FILM!

00:20:46.000 --> 00:20:50.180
And if you thought I was just gonna sit here and let you say you were right, like in the movie,

00:20:50.180 --> 00:20:53.440
you're freaking WRONG because I'm giving you the freak out you deserve!

00:20:53.440 --> 00:20:54.880
YOU FREAKING IDIOT!

00:20:57.020 --> 00:20:57.960
You finished?

00:20:57.960 --> 00:20:59.960
Yeah, I'm finished.

00:21:00.060 --> 00:21:01.480
You feel better?

00:21:01.820 --> 00:21:03.380
Yeah, I do.

00:21:05.060 --> 00:21:08.820
Come on, let's just hope the new Wonder Woman movie is better.

00:21:09.500 --> 00:21:14.620
So, the Joker comes to save Harley Quinn, which many die-hard fans have a problem with.

00:21:16.320 --> 00:21:17.220
Darling!

00:21:17.220 --> 00:21:18.200
Puddin'!

00:21:21.700 --> 00:21:25.440
Most incarnations of the two have the Joker treating Harley like garbage.

00:21:25.560 --> 00:21:28.340
A means to an end, he wouldn't bat an eye to save.

00:21:28.520 --> 00:21:34.520
But here's the thing. Harley Quinn, in turns of Batman lore, has not been around very long.

00:21:34.520 --> 00:21:37.560
So her story is more open to changes in the future.

00:21:37.560 --> 00:21:41.860
This is an interpretation that's different, but honestly kind of interesting.

00:21:41.860 --> 00:21:48.640
We've had plenty of times where the Joker has been self-centered, but this is kind of fascinating, to see him vulnerable and care about somebody.

00:21:48.860 --> 00:21:51.920
it's an aspect of the character not often explored.

00:21:51.920 --> 00:21:56.940
So regardless of which one you like better, I actually don't think it's a bad version to have out there.

00:21:57.180 --> 00:21:59.980
Especially because it's pretty dysfunctional either way.

00:22:00.980 --> 00:22:03.540
Oh, my bad.

00:22:07.660 --> 00:22:10.820
Harley! It's unlikely I'll be in the rest of this picture!

00:22:10.820 --> 00:22:11.560
Really?

00:22:11.560 --> 00:22:14.940
Yeah, in the grand scheme of things, I was pretty pointless.

00:22:14.940 --> 00:22:17.700
But remember me as the greatest Joker who ever..

00:22:18.880 --> 00:22:21.000
O-O-One of the greatest Jokers who ever...!

00:22:22.200 --> 00:22:25.620
Uh...the one who was played by a douche bag actor?

00:22:26.320 --> 00:22:27.300
...Okay.

00:22:27.300 --> 00:22:29.540
Haha! At least I'll be remembered for something!

00:22:29.540 --> 00:22:32.200
YAY, ATTENTION!

00:22:46.880 --> 00:22:49.640
Guys, Mr. J is dead.

00:22:52.340 --> 00:22:54.120
Sure he is...

00:22:54.120 --> 00:22:59.560
No guys, it's really sad. No, really. They killed off their most popular villain! D.C. didn't want Joker anymore.

00:22:59.560 --> 00:23:00.660
You gotta believe me!

00:23:00.660 --> 00:23:02.100
No, they really killed him off!

00:23:02.100 --> 00:23:05.280
We put up with all that bullshit for not even twelve minutes of film!

00:23:05.420 --> 00:23:06.860
I'm serious, you guys!

00:23:08.080 --> 00:23:09.120
I'm a dinosaur.

00:23:12.260 --> 00:23:14.960
Not just pretty words.

00:23:16.120 --> 00:23:19.300
But, it looks like the Squad wants answer from Rick, yours truly.

00:23:19.300 --> 00:23:21.560
Look, Rick Flag, or whatever your real name is.

00:23:21.560 --> 00:23:23.560
Actually, that is supposed to be my real name.

00:23:23.560 --> 00:23:24.560
Seriously?!

00:23:25.460 --> 00:23:27.720
Okay, look, we need some answers!

00:23:27.720 --> 00:23:32.620
Okay, the most powerful entity in the world has escaped and now wants to take over the world.

00:23:34.520 --> 00:23:36.280
Yeah, we know. We saw that scene.

00:23:36.280 --> 00:23:38.440
Yeah, you just showed it from a slightly different angle.

00:23:38.440 --> 00:23:40.600
Yeah, kind of weird repeating that.

00:23:40.600 --> 00:23:44.840
Nope, Nope! The chart says this is where you should feel hopeless and give up!

00:23:46.020 --> 00:23:48.560
What? That doesn't seem in character with any of us.

00:23:48.560 --> 00:23:50.720
Yeah. Every day could be our last, you know.

00:23:50.720 --> 00:23:55.280
No no no no no. This is the part where you have to feel defeated and puss out.

00:23:55.620 --> 00:23:59.040
Wait, the bad guys are supposed to puss out?

00:23:59.280 --> 00:23:59.780
Jiggy.

00:24:00.140 --> 00:24:03.320
Don't say jiggy! I literally invented jiggy!

00:24:03.560 --> 00:24:05.480
Wikky wikky wild wild west.?

00:24:05.960 --> 00:24:09.500
Ugh...okay, let's go and feel hopeless. I guess.

00:24:12.740 --> 00:24:14.740
Sure am feeling hopeless in here.

00:24:14.740 --> 00:24:17.100
Yeah, it's not like we risk life and death every day.

00:24:17.100 --> 00:24:19.980
Yeah, I'm crazy. So, uh, I don't know why I'm here.

00:24:19.980 --> 00:24:21.840
Well, we haven't gotten a line from Croc in a while.

00:24:24.800 --> 00:24:25.840
I'm a dinosaur.

00:24:26.260 --> 00:24:27.460
So, there's that.

00:24:27.660 --> 00:24:30.780
Also, Diablo's backstory. We don't know that.

00:24:33.880 --> 00:24:36.180
I killed my entire family.

00:24:37.060 --> 00:24:38.740
Meh, sounds about right.

00:24:39.900 --> 00:24:41.220
This doesn't shock any of you?!

00:24:41.220 --> 00:24:44.400
We're bad guys. How many times do we have to say it in this damn movie?

00:24:44.400 --> 00:24:48.880
Yeah, we should be like..."She's not taking over the world! We're taking over the world!"

00:24:48.880 --> 00:24:52.300
Yeah! Screw this scene, man! Let's give the audience what they god damn paid for.

00:24:52.300 --> 00:24:54.880
Wait! You're supposed to give a motivational speech!

00:24:54.880 --> 00:24:58.860
Supervillains, by definition, are the most motivated people in the world!

00:24:58.860 --> 00:25:01.220
I'm not giving in to any more of your goddamn clichés.

00:25:01.220 --> 00:25:03.120
We are gonna defeat her ultimate weapon of

00:25:03.280 --> 00:25:05.180
a PORTAL IN THE SKY?!

00:25:05.180 --> 00:25:06.240
Son of a bitch!

00:25:06.240 --> 00:25:08.720
Who's the asshole who keeps putting that in movies?!

00:25:08.720 --> 00:25:12.720
Who is that one asshole who keeps putting that cliche in there?!

00:25:15.980 --> 00:25:17.260
It's you, isn't it?

00:25:17.260 --> 00:25:20.420
White Chart Guy! You're the one who keeps putting it in all these films.

00:25:20.420 --> 00:25:25.540
Why? Is it some sort of sick, erotic thrill for you? Do you have some sort of specific fetish for it?

00:25:25.620 --> 00:25:27.780
No, Critic. It's not that at all.

00:25:27.780 --> 00:25:31.000
Now, if you'll excuse me. I have some paperwork to do.

00:25:39.620 --> 00:25:44.920
Oh, Avengers, oh, Fantastic Four, oh, Ghostbusters.

00:25:45.420 --> 00:25:48.240
You know my needs.

00:25:49.880 --> 00:25:51.800
Oh my God, cut away! CUT AWAY!

00:25:51.800 --> 00:25:55.760
Oh my God, I'd rather take a million portals in the sky than see the rest of that scene!

00:25:55.920 --> 00:25:56.840
Oh, Christ.

00:25:58.720 --> 00:26:03.480
C'mon, let's go from one dark, shadowy location to another dark, shadowy location.

00:26:04.080 --> 00:26:05.700
To boldly go.

00:26:06.720 --> 00:26:09.900
So the Squad get to the Enchantress and try to stop her.

00:26:10.400 --> 00:26:15.220
Hahahaha! It is time for you measly mortals to die!

00:26:15.220 --> 00:26:19.360
Soon the whole world will bow to my mercy!

00:26:19.580 --> 00:26:22.640
It is the end of days and-

00:26:23.460 --> 00:26:24.220
What?

00:26:24.220 --> 00:26:25.440
What are you doing?

00:26:25.880 --> 00:26:28.360
What? This is just the way that I move!

00:26:28.520 --> 00:26:29.220
Why?

00:26:29.480 --> 00:26:30.520
It just is.

00:26:30.520 --> 00:26:32.160
What are you gonna do, the Macarena?

00:26:32.420 --> 00:26:34.420
I will destroy you all!

00:26:34.420 --> 00:26:38.300
Hey, hey. You know those little dancing hula dolls that you put on your dashboard?

00:26:39.580 --> 00:26:44.700
Hahaha! You can't unsee it!

00:26:44.720 --> 00:26:45.800
Silence!

00:26:47.580 --> 00:26:50.600
Brother! Destroy them!

00:26:50.600 --> 00:26:54.860
I don't think so. Because as it turns out, I can do this the whole time.

00:26:59.260 --> 00:27:00.980
What the hell is that thing?

00:27:00.980 --> 00:27:03.600
And why the hell didn't we know that he could turn into tha--lemme guess.

00:27:03.700 --> 00:27:05.680
For the fans.

00:27:09.420 --> 00:27:14.380
But the Enchantress shows them the life they always wanted and she could give them if they only join her side.

00:27:14.800 --> 00:27:17.420
Please, Daddy. Do it for your daughter!

00:27:21.140 --> 00:27:27.980
Nooooo!

00:27:34.000 --> 00:27:35.660
Are you sure nobody's called us?

00:27:35.680 --> 00:27:37.480
Do you see the Batsignal?

00:27:41.740 --> 00:27:46.460
Nooooo!

00:27:46.460 --> 00:27:52.840
The Enchantress is destroyed, releasing the doctor inside and the squad go back to prison, this time treated with a little more respect.

00:27:53.160 --> 00:27:55.080
But, there's one more twist.

00:27:58.920 --> 00:28:00.280
Puddin!

00:28:03.240 --> 00:28:04.720
Let's go home.

00:28:09.580 --> 00:28:14.680
Wait a minute. That's it. A character we knew was alive turns up and that's your big clincher ending?

00:28:14.720 --> 00:28:18.880
But, it's the Joker. And anything he's in is immediately amazing.

00:28:18.880 --> 00:28:22.140
No, like anything, the Joker done RIGHT is amazing.

00:28:22.140 --> 00:28:25.380
Here, like everything else in this movie, is just done...

00:28:25.600 --> 00:28:26.580
passable.

00:28:27.960 --> 00:28:35.500
Despite it being a big hit, this movie divided a lot of audiences. Some loved it, some hated it. Others thought it was okay.

00:28:35.500 --> 00:28:37.780
Honestly, they're all understandable.

00:28:37.780 --> 00:28:42.420
None of it makes sense. And the pacing and tone feels incredibly inconsistent.

00:28:42.840 --> 00:28:44.720
And I can't imagine why that is.

00:28:44.880 --> 00:28:48.460
What can we say? Except you're welcome!

00:28:49.100 --> 00:28:51.560
You have to be pretty forgiving to get into it.

00:28:52.240 --> 00:28:56.900
But when the style and all around coolness works, I am kind of forgiving of it.

00:28:57.160 --> 00:29:02.860
It's got a lot of dumb boring moments, but the bad-ass moments are enough for me to say, "I'm glad I saw it."

00:29:02.920 --> 00:29:09.820
I know comic book audiences are already pretty complicated, but hearing all this, you can hopefully figure out if this is the right kind of dumb for you.

00:29:09.820 --> 00:29:11.600
or the wrong kind of dumb for you.

00:29:12.220 --> 00:29:19.840
But I'm still legitimately pissed off at the ending. Just with the Joker coming in and that's it. I'm sorry, this should've gone out on a higher note.

00:29:20.540 --> 00:29:24.320
Well, you know what. This is my take on Suicide Squad and I'm gonna fix it.

00:29:24.320 --> 00:29:29.880
I'm going to replace the Joker with the one character I know would get a gigantic reaction.

00:29:35.300 --> 00:29:36.600
...Bill!

00:29:36.940 --> 00:29:38.420
Mhm..?

00:29:39.340 --> 00:29:40.480
Let's go home!

00:29:40.480 --> 00:29:41.560
Mhm!

00:30:46.120 --> 00:30:47.280
Mhm!

00:30:52.800 --> 00:30:57.780
Hey! Doug Walker here doing the charity shoutout, and this week we are doing Feeding America.

00:30:58.580 --> 00:31:02.500
This is the nation's largest demoestic hunger relief organization.

00:31:02.620 --> 00:31:08.020
Together with individuals, charities, businesses, and government, we can end hunger.

00:31:08.200 --> 00:31:15.200
They provide safe and nurturing places for children to have a meal, food that helps seniors meet their nutritional needs...

00:31:15.320 --> 00:31:22.820
emergency assistance for disaster victims, and a chance at stability for adults trying to break the cycle of poverty and hunger.

00:31:22.820 --> 00:31:29.620
In a country that wastes billions of pounds of food each year, it's almost shocking that anyone in America goes hungry.

00:31:29.780 --> 00:31:35.340
Yet, every day, there are millions of children and adults who don't get the meals they need to thrive

00:31:35.340 --> 00:31:40.900
They work to get nourishing food from farmers, manufacturers, and retailers to people in need.

00:31:40.900 --> 00:31:46.880
At the same time, they also seek to help people build a path to a brighter, food-secure future.

00:31:46.980 --> 00:31:55.860
If you look at their site or their YouTube page, you can see the many different ways they use to keep people fed, as well as hear many personal stories about how they've helped.

00:31:56.100 --> 00:32:03.100
It's a great organization and you can be a part of what makes it so great. Click on the link below and see how you too, can get involved.
