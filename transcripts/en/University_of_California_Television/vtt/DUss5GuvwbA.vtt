- [narrator] We are the
paradoxical aid,

00:00:06.539 --> 00:00:13.420
bipedal, naked, large
brained, long the master of

00:00:13.600 --> 00:00:21.880
fire, tools and language but still trying
to understand ourselves. Aware that death

00:00:22.060 --> 00:00:30.670
is inevitable yet filled with optimism.
We grow up slowly. We hand down knowledge.

00:00:30.850 --> 00:00:38.703
We empathize and deceive. We shape the
future from our shared understanding of

00:00:38.703 --> 00:00:45.790
the past. CARTA brings together experts
from diverse disciplines to exchange

00:00:45.970 --> 00:00:53.120
insights on who we are and how we got
here. An exploration made possible by the

00:00:53.300 --> 00:00:58.299
generosity of humans like you.

It's my pleasure to welcome you to this
CARTA symposium on How Language Evolves.

00:02:06.040 --> 00:02:11.500
I'd like to welcome you and we know that
among the oldest questions that humans

00:02:11.680 --> 00:02:18.940
have ever asked these included "Who are
we? What are we doing here? Where

00:02:19.120 --> 00:02:25.830
did we come from? How did we get
here?" and "Where are we going?"

00:02:26.010 --> 00:02:31.090
At CARTA we believe that two of these
questions are now eminently study able

00:02:31.270 --> 00:02:37.063
with evidence based research namely
"Where did we come from?" and

00:02:37.063 --> 00:02:38.845
"How did we get here?"

00:02:41.200 --> 00:02:47.070
Anthropogeny is the term referring to
explaining the origin of humans and it's a

00:02:47.250 --> 00:02:55.350
very old term that was forgotten and we
try to resuscitate to indicate that to

00:02:55.530 --> 00:02:59.740
explain human origins we really need to
use all avenues of science. The social

00:02:59.920 --> 00:03:04.070
sciences and the biological
sciences alike.

00:03:04.250 --> 00:03:11.040
CARTA is a official research unit at UCSD.
The three co-directors of CARTA are Ajit

00:03:11.220 --> 00:03:18.560
Varki, Fred Gage and Margaret Schoeninger.
Part of the team are also Linda Nelson,

00:03:18.740 --> 00:03:23.160
our Management Service Officer and Ingrid
Benirschke-Perkins who is our Community

00:03:23.340 --> 00:03:28.190
Relations Director. And we've got very
important support by Kate Kaya and John

00:03:28.370 --> 00:03:33.230
Moreland our Computer Systems Programmers
and Analyst. And also Jesse Robie and

00:03:33.410 --> 00:03:38.110
John Spotts who have all contributed to
making this event possible.

00:03:38.290 --> 00:03:42.790
So pursuing Anthropogeny involves most
academic disciplines ranging from the

00:03:42.970 --> 00:03:47.420
social to the molecular and it's been a
great challenge trying to get scientists

00:03:47.600 --> 00:03:51.050
from all these disciplines to talk
together willing to learn each other's

00:03:51.230 --> 00:03:57.960
terminologies and avoid jargon whenever
possible or at least translate jargon.

00:03:58.140 --> 00:04:02.730
The CARTA Mission Statement is as follows:
We want to use all rational and ethical

00:04:02.910 --> 00:04:08.490
approaches to seek all verifiable facts
from all relevant disciplines to explore

00:04:08.670 --> 00:04:13.880
and explain the origins of the human
phenomenon while minimizing complex

00:04:14.060 --> 00:04:19.100
organizational structures and hierarchies,
which we find quite difficult. And

00:04:19.280 --> 00:04:25.500
avoiding unnecessary paperwork and
bureaucracy which is equally difficult.

00:04:25.680 --> 00:04:29.270
In the process of course, we want to
raise awareness and understanding of the

00:04:29.450 --> 00:04:34.950
study of human origins within the academic
community and the public at large. And I'm

00:04:35.130 --> 00:04:39.510
very happy to see many faces that I know
from around here not necessarily just the

00:04:39.690 --> 00:04:45.630
university. Of course, we want to give
special thanks to our major sponsors The

00:04:45.810 --> 00:04:50.850
G. Harold and Leila Y. Mathers Charitable
Foundation of New York, and its Executive

00:04:51.030 --> 00:04:54.370
Director Jim Handelman.

00:04:54.550 --> 00:05:00.510
We've been very lucky to have a lot of
supporters over the years. Many of them

00:05:00.690 --> 00:05:04.020
are here in this room and I'd like to
specially mention Annette Merle-Smith and

00:05:04.200 --> 00:05:07.980
Rita Atkinson. And thank you all for this
important support that continues to make

00:05:08.160 --> 00:05:14.290
these public symposia an important
exchanges of information possible. Also

00:05:14.470 --> 00:05:20.210
special thanks to the UCSD-TV crew Rich
Wargo, Matt Alioto, Marci Bretts, Ken

00:05:20.390 --> 00:05:26.250
Kebow and Jacob Parker. As well as voice
and video Mike Guymon and Josh Stolze.

00:05:26.430 --> 00:05:31.680
And our ASL Interpreters Dan Fisher and
Amber Graves who you see very busily

00:05:31.860 --> 00:05:36.950
translate up here on stage. I thank you
very much and without further ado, I will

00:05:37.130 --> 00:05:41.517
introduce one of our two chairpersons,
Roger Levy, please.
