WHITNEY BOUCK: Box is
a Cloud based platform

00:00:06.190 --> 00:00:08.810
and an application,
both for end users

00:00:08.810 --> 00:00:11.009
to more effectively share
business information,

00:00:11.009 --> 00:00:13.300
work with their colleagues
in a more effective way then

00:00:13.300 --> 00:00:15.860
they've been able to do before.

00:00:15.860 --> 00:00:18.792
Box is currently serving over
200,000 unique businesses

00:00:18.792 --> 00:00:19.500
around the world.

00:00:19.500 --> 00:00:21.470
Very, very small
mom and pop shops,

00:00:21.470 --> 00:00:24.060
companies of even
three to five people,

00:00:24.060 --> 00:00:26.750
all the way up to some of the
world's largest organizations

00:00:26.750 --> 00:00:29.857
that are multinational
in nature.

00:00:29.857 --> 00:00:31.940
DAVID MAYNARD: More then
half of our Android users

00:00:31.940 --> 00:00:33.580
come from outside
the United States.

00:00:33.580 --> 00:00:35.590
WHITNEY BOUCK:
Android-like Box, I think,

00:00:35.590 --> 00:00:40.400
has this wonderful openness
and kind of natural traction.

00:00:40.400 --> 00:00:42.600
You get a lot of
adoption virally.

00:00:42.600 --> 00:00:45.510
You get a lot of people who
really love their Android

00:00:45.510 --> 00:00:46.860
device.

00:00:46.860 --> 00:00:50.080
So I love the fact that we share
a common philosophy in openness

00:00:50.080 --> 00:00:51.062
for our customers.

00:00:51.062 --> 00:00:53.270
DAVID MAYNARD: We've seen
over five million downloads

00:00:53.270 --> 00:00:56.790
on the Android application
on both phones and tablets.

00:00:56.790 --> 00:00:58.490
SIMON TAN: I'm real
excited that Box

00:00:58.490 --> 00:01:00.380
has such a big focus
on mobile right now.

00:01:00.380 --> 00:01:02.160
We have a full suite
of mobile apps.

00:01:02.160 --> 00:01:04.556
Box from Android is starting
to pick up a lot of traction

00:01:04.556 --> 00:01:05.716
in the enterprise as well.

00:01:05.716 --> 00:01:07.090
DAVID MAYNARD:
The Android system

00:01:07.090 --> 00:01:08.757
makes localization
easy and simple.

00:01:08.757 --> 00:01:10.715
SIMON TAN: And also
Android is really flexible.

00:01:10.715 --> 00:01:13.006
So there's a lot of things
we can do on Android that we

00:01:13.006 --> 00:01:14.220
can't do on other platforms.

00:01:14.220 --> 00:01:17.180
The developer console helps us
understand our user base more

00:01:17.180 --> 00:01:19.576
and let's us see
where they are from,

00:01:19.576 --> 00:01:20.950
let's us see what
devices they're

00:01:20.950 --> 00:01:23.550
using, what version of
Android they're running.

00:01:23.550 --> 00:01:25.790
Lets us see the reviews
and ratings, let's

00:01:25.790 --> 00:01:27.247
us respond to those reviews.

00:01:27.247 --> 00:01:29.455
DAVID MAYNARD: What I love
about the Android platform

00:01:29.455 --> 00:01:33.290
is that we control how fast
we iterate on the product

00:01:33.290 --> 00:01:35.920
and what we ship to
consumers and when.

00:01:35.920 --> 00:01:37.810
We also love the
fact that we can

00:01:37.810 --> 00:01:40.420
do rolling roll outs of
the product we tested.

00:01:40.420 --> 00:01:43.090
We typically roll out a
new release to about 10%

00:01:43.090 --> 00:01:43.940
of our user base.

00:01:43.940 --> 00:01:46.380
And we monitor how the
application is behaving.

00:01:46.380 --> 00:01:50.860
We monitor both performance
and usage of the application.

00:01:50.860 --> 00:01:52.800
And typically
after a half a day,

00:01:52.800 --> 00:01:55.080
we roll it out to
50% of our user base.

00:01:55.080 --> 00:01:58.890
And perhaps after 24
hours, we roll out to 100%.

00:01:58.890 --> 00:02:03.290
It's been a great help in
making sure our application is

00:02:03.290 --> 00:02:03.930
flawless.

00:02:03.930 --> 00:02:06.620
One of the examples of
leading the future on Android

00:02:06.620 --> 00:02:09.610
is the ability to add
collaborators to folders.

00:02:09.610 --> 00:02:13.640
The first mobile implementation
of that was on Android.

00:02:13.640 --> 00:02:16.190
Android is a great platform
for integrating and getting

00:02:16.190 --> 00:02:20.660
consumer feedback and enterprise
feedback very quickly.
