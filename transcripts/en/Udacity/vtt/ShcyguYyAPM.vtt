Bizarre behavior is the last of the positive symptoms associated with

00:00:03.536 --> 00:00:08.310
schizophrenia. By positive, we do not mean pleasant, but instead we mean the

00:00:08.310 --> 00:00:13.140
presence of. So we've seen the presence of delusions, hallucinations,

00:00:13.140 --> 00:00:17.832
disorganized speech, and bizarre behavior. In addition, we also have the

00:00:17.832 --> 00:00:23.068
negative symptoms. And these can include non-responsiveness, emotional

00:00:23.068 --> 00:00:29.490
flatness, immobility or catatonia, which is striking a strange pose. We also

00:00:29.490 --> 00:00:36.626
see reduction in speaking. The inability to complete tasks. Sometimes a lack of

00:00:36.626 --> 00:00:41.724
motivation. And even diminished cognitive function. We also see that sometimes

00:00:41.724 --> 00:00:45.444
people no longer tend or take care of their personal hygiene and they often

00:00:45.444 --> 00:00:49.960
have little to no interest in interacting with others.
