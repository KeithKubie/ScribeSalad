00:00:00.640 --> 00:00:03.180
I think it's reasonable to
do one more separable

00:00:03.180 --> 00:00:07.214
differential equations problem,
so let's do it.

00:00:07.214 --> 00:00:13.430
The derivative of y with respect
to x is equal to y

00:00:13.430 --> 00:00:22.460
cosine of x divided by 1 plus
2y squared, and they give us

00:00:22.460 --> 00:00:27.080
an initial condition that
y of 0 is equal to 1.

00:00:27.080 --> 00:00:29.920
Or when x is equal to
0, y is equal to 1.

00:00:29.920 --> 00:00:32.130
And I know we did a couple
already, but another way to

00:00:32.130 --> 00:00:34.530
think about separable
differential equations is

00:00:34.530 --> 00:00:37.300
really, all you're
doing is implicit

00:00:37.300 --> 00:00:39.000
differentiation in reverse.

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:41.930
Or another way to think about
it is whenever you took an

00:00:41.930 --> 00:00:46.340
implicit derivative, the end
product was a separable

00:00:46.340 --> 00:00:47.800
differential equation.

00:00:47.800 --> 00:00:52.130
And so, this hopefully forms a
little bit of a connection.

00:00:52.130 --> 00:00:53.030
Anyway, let's just do this.

00:00:53.030 --> 00:00:55.480
We have to separate the
y's from the x's.

00:00:55.480 --> 00:00:59.170
Let's multiply both sides
times 1 plus 2y squared.

00:00:59.170 --> 00:01:07.050
We get 1 plus 2y squared
times dy dx is equal

00:01:07.050 --> 00:01:10.360
to y cosine of x.

00:01:10.360 --> 00:01:13.130
We still haven't fully separated
the y's and the x's.

00:01:13.130 --> 00:01:17.190
Let's divide both sides of this
by y, and then let's see.

00:01:17.190 --> 00:01:23.080
We get 1 over y plus 2y squared
divided by y, that's

00:01:23.080 --> 00:01:31.020
just 2y, times dy dx is
equal to cosine of x.

00:01:31.020 --> 00:01:34.430
I can just multiply
both sides by dx.

00:01:34.430 --> 00:01:42.860
1 over y plus 2y times dy is
equal to cosine of x dx.

00:01:42.860 --> 00:01:45.380
And now we can integrate
both sides.

00:01:50.670 --> 00:01:54.090
So what's the integral of 1
over y with respect to y?

00:01:54.090 --> 00:01:57.620
I know your gut reaction is the
natural log of y, which is

00:01:57.620 --> 00:02:01.060
correct, but there's actually
a slightly broader function

00:02:01.060 --> 00:02:03.450
than that, whose derivative is
actually 1 over y, and that's

00:02:03.450 --> 00:02:06.550
the natural log of the
absolute value of y.

00:02:06.550 --> 00:02:11.640
And this is just a slightly
broader function, because it's

00:02:11.640 --> 00:02:15.550
domain includes positive and
negative numbers, it just

00:02:15.550 --> 00:02:16.240
excludes 0.

00:02:16.240 --> 00:02:18.910
While natural log of
y only includes

00:02:18.910 --> 00:02:21.160
numbers larger than 0.

00:02:21.160 --> 00:02:23.750
So natural log of absolute value
of y is nice, and it's

00:02:23.750 --> 00:02:27.200
actually true that at all
points other than 0, its

00:02:27.200 --> 00:02:28.990
derivative is 1 over y.

00:02:28.990 --> 00:02:31.140
It's just a slightly
broader function.

00:02:31.140 --> 00:02:33.550
So that's the antiderivative
of 1 over y, and we proved

00:02:33.550 --> 00:02:35.330
that, or at least we proved that
the derivative of natural

00:02:35.330 --> 00:02:38.000
log of y is 1 over y.

00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:40.890
Plus, what's the antiderivative
of 2y with

00:02:40.890 --> 00:02:41.410
respect to y?

00:02:41.410 --> 00:02:45.020
Well, it's y squared, is
equal to-- I'll do the

00:02:45.020 --> 00:02:47.230
plus c on this side.

00:02:47.230 --> 00:02:48.990
Whose derivative
is cosine of x?

00:02:48.990 --> 00:02:50.240
Well, it's sine of x.

00:02:53.290 --> 00:02:56.650
And then we could
add the plus c.

00:02:56.650 --> 00:02:59.340
We could add that
plus c there.

00:02:59.340 --> 00:03:00.870
And what was our initial
condition? y of

00:03:00.870 --> 00:03:02.000
0 is equal to 1.

00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:04.470
So when x is equal to
0, y is equal to 1.

00:03:08.175 --> 00:03:13.350
So ln of the absolute value of
1 plus 1 squared is equal to

00:03:13.350 --> 00:03:16.870
sine of 0 plus c.

00:03:16.870 --> 00:03:19.170
The natural log of one, e
to the what power is 1?

00:03:19.170 --> 00:03:24.530
Well, 0, plus 1 is-- sine of
0 is 0 --is equal to C.

00:03:24.530 --> 00:03:27.600
So we get c is equal to 1.

00:03:27.600 --> 00:03:32.710
So the solution to this
differential equation up here

00:03:32.710 --> 00:03:35.740
is, I don't even have to rewrite
it, we figured out c

00:03:35.740 --> 00:03:37.820
is equal to 1, so we can just
scratch this out, and

00:03:37.820 --> 00:03:39.020
we could put a 1.

00:03:39.020 --> 00:03:42.060
The natural log of the absolute
value of y plus y

00:03:42.060 --> 00:03:46.210
squared is equal to
sine of x plus 1.

00:03:46.210 --> 00:03:49.080
And actually, if you were to
graph this, you would see that

00:03:49.080 --> 00:03:53.430
y never actually dips below
or even hits the x-axis.

00:03:53.430 --> 00:03:55.470
So you can actually get
rid of that absolute

00:03:55.470 --> 00:03:56.700
value function there.

00:03:56.700 --> 00:03:58.150
But anyway, that's just
a little technicality.

00:03:58.150 --> 00:04:02.520
But this is the implicit form
of the solution to this

00:04:02.520 --> 00:04:03.380
differential equation.

00:04:03.380 --> 00:04:05.680
That makes sense, because the
separable differential

00:04:05.680 --> 00:04:06.800
equations are really just

00:04:06.800 --> 00:04:09.740
implicit derivatives backwards.

00:04:09.740 --> 00:04:13.120
And in general, one thing
that's kind of fun about

00:04:13.120 --> 00:04:15.810
differential equations, but
kind of not as satisfying

00:04:15.810 --> 00:04:19.490
about differential equations,
is it really is just a whole

00:04:19.490 --> 00:04:22.840
hodgepodge of tools to solve
different types of equations.

00:04:22.840 --> 00:04:27.380
There isn't just one tool or one
theory that will solve all

00:04:27.380 --> 00:04:28.180
differential equations.

00:04:28.180 --> 00:04:30.600
There are few that will solve
a certain class of

00:04:30.600 --> 00:04:32.810
differential equations, but
there's not just one

00:04:32.810 --> 00:04:34.320
consistent way to solve
all of them.

00:04:34.320 --> 00:04:37.100
And even today, there are
unsolved differential

00:04:37.100 --> 00:04:39.390
equations, where the only way
that we know how to get

00:04:39.390 --> 00:04:42.660
solutions is using a computer
numerically.

00:04:42.660 --> 00:04:44.060
And one day I'll do
videos on that.

00:04:44.060 --> 00:04:47.280
And actually, you'll find that
in most applications, that's

00:04:47.280 --> 00:04:49.460
what you end up doing anyway,
because most differential

00:04:49.460 --> 00:04:54.280
equations you encounter in
science or with any kind of

00:04:54.280 --> 00:04:56.500
science, whether it's economics,
or physics, or

00:04:56.500 --> 00:05:01.260
engineering, that they often are
unsolveable, because they

00:05:01.260 --> 00:05:04.050
might have a second or third
derivative involved, and

00:05:04.050 --> 00:05:05.090
they're going to multiply.

00:05:05.090 --> 00:05:06.760
I mean, they're just going to
be really complicated, very

00:05:06.760 --> 00:05:08.040
hard to solve analytically.

00:05:08.040 --> 00:05:10.260
And actually, you are going to
solve them numerically, which

00:05:10.260 --> 00:05:11.910
is often much easier.

00:05:11.910 --> 00:05:14.520
But anyway, hopefully at this
point you have a pretty good

00:05:14.520 --> 00:05:15.950
sense of separable equations.

00:05:15.950 --> 00:05:17.860
They're just implicit
differentiation backwards, and

00:05:17.860 --> 00:05:20.020
it's really nothing new.

00:05:20.020 --> 00:05:24.600
Our next thing we'll learn is
exact differential equations,

00:05:24.600 --> 00:05:27.210
and then we'll go off into
more and more methods.

00:05:27.210 --> 00:05:29.640
And then hopefully, by the end
of this playlist, you'll have

00:05:29.640 --> 00:05:32.470
a nice toolkit of all the
different ways to solve at

00:05:32.470 --> 00:05:34.890
least the solvable differential
equations.

00:05:34.890 --> 00:05:36.140
See you in the next video.
