00:00:06.240 --> 00:00:09.370
SPEAKER: And then joining us
today is Helder Guimaraes.

00:00:09.370 --> 00:00:12.570
Helder is a world renowned
sleight of hand magician.

00:00:12.570 --> 00:00:15.710
He's received top honors
from the Academy of Magical

00:00:15.710 --> 00:00:19.370
Arts in Hollywood, and in
2006 became the youngest ever

00:00:19.370 --> 00:00:21.350
world champion of card magic.

00:00:21.350 --> 00:00:23.090
The "New York Times"
has described him

00:00:23.090 --> 00:00:25.390
as a master of illusions.

00:00:25.390 --> 00:00:28.718
And in the review of his
last show, "Borrowed Time,"

00:00:28.718 --> 00:00:30.260
the "Los Angeles
Times" described him

00:00:30.260 --> 00:00:32.140
as remarkably sincere
and trustworthy

00:00:32.140 --> 00:00:34.220
for a man committed
to deception.

00:00:34.220 --> 00:00:37.370
His newest one man show
is "Invisible Tango,"

00:00:37.370 --> 00:00:41.090
featuring direction by "Jurassic
World" producer Frank Marshall.

00:00:41.090 --> 00:00:44.390
And just announced an
original soundtrack by Moby.

00:00:44.390 --> 00:00:45.890
So Helder, thank
you for joining us.

00:00:45.890 --> 00:00:48.140
HELDER GUIMARAES: Thank you
very much for inviting me.

00:00:48.140 --> 00:00:48.662
[APPLAUSE]

00:00:48.662 --> 00:00:51.057
Thank you.

00:00:51.057 --> 00:00:52.640
SPEAKER: So first
off, I'd like to get

00:00:52.640 --> 00:00:54.800
into your background a bit.

00:00:54.800 --> 00:00:56.600
How did you get
into magic, and what

00:00:56.600 --> 00:00:59.900
drew you to sleight
of hand in particular?

00:00:59.900 --> 00:01:03.620
HELDER GUIMARAES:
So my father was

00:01:03.620 --> 00:01:07.580
kind of the reason why
I started in magic.

00:01:07.580 --> 00:01:11.630
My father did and still
does magic as a hobby.

00:01:11.630 --> 00:01:16.460
And when I was
three days old, he

00:01:16.460 --> 00:01:20.330
took a photo of me holding
playing cards, which

00:01:20.330 --> 00:01:24.890
is very ridiculous because it's
a three-day-old baby holding

00:01:24.890 --> 00:01:26.720
playing cards.

00:01:26.720 --> 00:01:29.660
And that was something that
was always a little bit

00:01:29.660 --> 00:01:34.160
on the back of my
imagination, growing up,

00:01:34.160 --> 00:01:37.190
knowing that that was the
first photo that anyone--

00:01:37.190 --> 00:01:41.790
yeah, I was born in '82.

00:01:41.790 --> 00:01:43.160
And in '82, there was no phones.

00:01:43.160 --> 00:01:46.720
So people would not take photos
as the birth is happening.

00:01:46.720 --> 00:01:48.580
It would take some
days to take photos.

00:01:48.580 --> 00:01:51.260
So with three days old,
they take my first photo,

00:01:51.260 --> 00:01:54.560
and that's with
the playing cards.

00:01:54.560 --> 00:01:57.230
And fast forward
a couple of years.

00:01:57.230 --> 00:02:02.240
When I was three, there
was a Christmas party

00:02:02.240 --> 00:02:04.070
in my kindergarten.

00:02:04.070 --> 00:02:06.140
And the owner of
the kindergarten

00:02:06.140 --> 00:02:09.410
knew that my father did magic.

00:02:09.410 --> 00:02:10.910
So he said, you
want to do something

00:02:10.910 --> 00:02:13.730
for Helder's class
and the classmates?

00:02:13.730 --> 00:02:15.590
And he said, sure, I'll do it.

00:02:15.590 --> 00:02:18.710
And my father asked me, do
you want to do something?

00:02:18.710 --> 00:02:20.453
And I'm three.

00:02:20.453 --> 00:02:21.870
What do I know
about [INAUDIBLE]??

00:02:21.870 --> 00:02:22.828
I was like, yeah, sure.

00:02:22.828 --> 00:02:25.150
So I'll do it.

00:02:25.150 --> 00:02:30.890
And it was fun because all
of the sudden, I'm three.

00:02:30.890 --> 00:02:35.480
Actually, when the show
happened, I was already four.

00:02:35.480 --> 00:02:38.800
So I was a big guy at that time.

00:02:38.800 --> 00:02:42.770
But basically,
there was a moment

00:02:42.770 --> 00:02:45.120
where I did something
very simple,

00:02:45.120 --> 00:02:51.200
but for the class, for
my kindergarten class,

00:02:51.200 --> 00:02:53.210
was like the best thing ever.

00:02:53.210 --> 00:02:54.460
I had a box.

00:02:54.460 --> 00:02:55.510
I would open the box.

00:02:55.510 --> 00:02:56.750
I would show the box empty.

00:02:56.750 --> 00:02:59.250
I would close the box.

00:02:59.250 --> 00:03:00.560
I would say the magic words.

00:03:00.560 --> 00:03:04.430
I would open the box, and the
box was filled with candies.

00:03:04.430 --> 00:03:09.567
And I start throwing the
candies out for the classmate.

00:03:09.567 --> 00:03:10.400
Not happening today.

00:03:10.400 --> 00:03:11.240
SPEAKER: That's not
happening today.

00:03:11.240 --> 00:03:12.823
HELDER GUIMARAES:
Not happening today.

00:03:14.960 --> 00:03:19.610
And all of the sudden, I'm the
hero for a couple of weeks.

00:03:19.610 --> 00:03:23.180
Like this is our friend
that makes candy appear.

00:03:23.180 --> 00:03:26.880
That's the guy to hang out with.

00:03:26.880 --> 00:03:30.190
And I think that was kind of
an interesting moment in terms

00:03:30.190 --> 00:03:33.590
of memory, because I still
remember the feeling of,

00:03:33.590 --> 00:03:37.015
in the weeks following that
party, kids coming to me

00:03:37.015 --> 00:03:38.390
and going like,
that was amazing.

00:03:38.390 --> 00:03:40.070
That was great.

00:03:40.070 --> 00:03:44.720
And I just kept doing it, a
little bit without knowing

00:03:44.720 --> 00:03:45.890
where it would take me.

00:03:45.890 --> 00:03:47.460
It just made sense.

00:03:47.460 --> 00:03:50.660
So I kept evolving, doing a
little bit more complex things,

00:03:50.660 --> 00:03:53.360
doing more interesting things.

00:03:53.360 --> 00:03:59.090
Around the age of
nine, I think nine, 10,

00:03:59.090 --> 00:04:02.210
that's when I went like, I
don't know if this is for me.

00:04:02.210 --> 00:04:03.470
And I stop.

00:04:03.470 --> 00:04:07.790
And I just stopped
for two, three months.

00:04:07.790 --> 00:04:09.950
And then I was
like, you know what?

00:04:09.950 --> 00:04:11.000
I can't.

00:04:11.000 --> 00:04:12.340
I really have to do this.

00:04:12.340 --> 00:04:14.450
I didn't know why, but
there was something

00:04:14.450 --> 00:04:18.240
that was pushing me to go back.

00:04:18.240 --> 00:04:21.200
So I went basically
back to doing magic

00:04:21.200 --> 00:04:22.980
without knowing
why I was doing it,

00:04:22.980 --> 00:04:26.280
but having the feeling
that I have to do it.

00:04:26.280 --> 00:04:29.987
And eventually, at that time--

00:04:29.987 --> 00:04:31.820
now I'm going to go a
little bit technical--

00:04:31.820 --> 00:04:34.740
but when you are a kid,
your hands are smaller.

00:04:34.740 --> 00:04:37.190
So you can't really
do sleight of hand

00:04:37.190 --> 00:04:39.470
the same way you can do
when you start growing up.

00:04:39.470 --> 00:04:42.680
But when you are 12, you
start going to that phase.

00:04:42.680 --> 00:04:47.090
11, 12, you start having the
ability to at least start

00:04:47.090 --> 00:04:48.470
on that route.

00:04:48.470 --> 00:04:52.670
And at that point,
I've seen a show.

00:04:52.670 --> 00:04:54.540
I went to Madrid.

00:04:54.540 --> 00:05:00.380
And I saw a show of a magician
that I've seen videos of him

00:05:00.380 --> 00:05:01.280
before.

00:05:01.280 --> 00:05:07.830
Not on the internet, but
on VHS, which good times.

00:05:07.830 --> 00:05:09.570
But I've seen a bunch
of videos from him.

00:05:09.570 --> 00:05:12.510
And now I got the
opportunity to see him live.

00:05:12.510 --> 00:05:14.550
And he was amazing.

00:05:14.550 --> 00:05:16.750
Because he was still alive.

00:05:16.750 --> 00:05:18.420
His name is Juan Tamariz.

00:05:18.420 --> 00:05:21.660
He had a bunch of
TV shows in Spain.

00:05:21.660 --> 00:05:26.760
But all his work revolves
around playing cards

00:05:26.760 --> 00:05:28.740
and the sense of humor.

00:05:28.740 --> 00:05:32.340
And that for me just all of
the sudden made complete sense.

00:05:32.340 --> 00:05:34.560
And I went like, this is it.

00:05:34.560 --> 00:05:37.080
I always loved humors.

00:05:37.080 --> 00:05:39.060
I always loved comedians.

00:05:39.060 --> 00:05:40.380
I loved magic.

00:05:40.380 --> 00:05:43.080
I said, I know this is it.

00:05:43.080 --> 00:05:47.580
I don't want to be him, but I
know that these two things are

00:05:47.580 --> 00:05:50.010
going to be part of my journey.

00:05:50.010 --> 00:05:51.900
And so then I start
to focus on playing

00:05:51.900 --> 00:05:53.860
cards and sleight of hand.

00:05:53.860 --> 00:05:56.958
And then it evolved from there.

00:05:56.958 --> 00:05:57.750
SPEAKER: Excellent.

00:05:57.750 --> 00:05:58.470
Thank you.

00:05:58.470 --> 00:05:59.640
And then so--

00:05:59.640 --> 00:06:02.290
HELDER GUIMARAES: I give
really long answers.

00:06:02.290 --> 00:06:06.600
So just for you to know, next
time you ask me something,

00:06:06.600 --> 00:06:07.837
just be careful.

00:06:07.837 --> 00:06:08.670
SPEAKER: Duly noted.

00:06:11.660 --> 00:06:18.170
So then [INAUDIBLE] going
from just magic as a hobby

00:06:18.170 --> 00:06:19.760
to professional magic.

00:06:19.760 --> 00:06:22.890
So in 2006, you won the
World Championship of Magic.

00:06:22.890 --> 00:06:25.280
And that's what kind
of launched your career

00:06:25.280 --> 00:06:26.290
into professional magic.

00:06:26.290 --> 00:06:28.730
Also, from what I've heard,
there was a bit of controversy

00:06:28.730 --> 00:06:29.230
there.

00:06:29.230 --> 00:06:31.533
They didn't believe your
performance was possible.

00:06:31.533 --> 00:06:32.450
HELDER GUIMARAES: Yes.

00:06:32.450 --> 00:06:33.932
SPEAKER: It's amazing.

00:06:33.932 --> 00:06:35.390
So yeah, can you
tell a little more

00:06:35.390 --> 00:06:43.340
how you then became a
professional at magic, I guess?

00:06:43.340 --> 00:06:49.130
HELDER GUIMARAES: Well, that's
actually a very short answer.

00:06:49.130 --> 00:06:51.130
Basically, you become
a professional at magic

00:06:51.130 --> 00:06:56.880
when you get paid to do
it on a regular basis.

00:06:56.880 --> 00:06:58.850
SPEAKER: OK. [? Fascinating. ?]

00:06:58.850 --> 00:07:01.760
HELDER GUIMARAES:
Now, you tell me--

00:07:01.760 --> 00:07:04.910
I think what you want to
know is how I kind of went

00:07:04.910 --> 00:07:06.210
into that direction.

00:07:06.210 --> 00:07:10.700
So I think since I'm 16, 17,
I kind of go like, I really

00:07:10.700 --> 00:07:12.470
want to be a magician.

00:07:12.470 --> 00:07:15.650
That's what I want to be.

00:07:15.650 --> 00:07:18.770
You never know if it's possible
or not, especially growing up

00:07:18.770 --> 00:07:20.150
in Portugal.

00:07:20.150 --> 00:07:23.000
It's not necessarily
the country that

00:07:23.000 --> 00:07:29.000
is best known for magic or to
be able to live comfortably

00:07:29.000 --> 00:07:31.250
from just doing magic.

00:07:31.250 --> 00:07:34.340
So in my head, I
always knew that if I

00:07:34.340 --> 00:07:36.170
wanted to become a
magician, I would

00:07:36.170 --> 00:07:40.010
have to search for a more
international career.

00:07:40.010 --> 00:07:45.030
And one of the ways of
starting that career,

00:07:45.030 --> 00:07:49.460
I knew it would be to
win a prize at the World

00:07:49.460 --> 00:07:52.370
Championship of Magic,
because that would just

00:07:52.370 --> 00:07:58.700
trigger a lot of invitations
and people trying to hire you.

00:07:58.700 --> 00:08:00.230
So I knew that.

00:08:00.230 --> 00:08:06.500
So a few years before, actually
four years before that,

00:08:06.500 --> 00:08:08.720
I went to theater school.

00:08:08.720 --> 00:08:11.915
Because I knew that
was another thing,

00:08:11.915 --> 00:08:15.920
is that in the
journey to find, let's

00:08:15.920 --> 00:08:18.350
say, my path, all
of the sudden I

00:08:18.350 --> 00:08:22.760
randomly encounter myself
doing theater and doing

00:08:22.760 --> 00:08:24.110
theater workshops.

00:08:24.110 --> 00:08:26.910
And it makes sense to me to
combine all those things--

00:08:26.910 --> 00:08:28.970
humor, theater, and magic.

00:08:28.970 --> 00:08:33.200
And so I have to
go to university.

00:08:33.200 --> 00:08:35.990
Actually, the first
university I went to

00:08:35.990 --> 00:08:39.320
was for computer science.

00:08:39.320 --> 00:08:43.880
So I could have actually
been here, but seated there.

00:08:43.880 --> 00:08:49.070
But I really don't know how you
guys spend so much time sitting

00:08:49.070 --> 00:08:52.010
in front of computers.

00:08:52.010 --> 00:08:58.490
The first year I went to
university in computer science,

00:08:58.490 --> 00:09:01.580
we had group tasks
that we had to do

00:09:01.580 --> 00:09:04.340
and with a group of four people.

00:09:04.340 --> 00:09:06.320
And three of them
would be sitting

00:09:06.320 --> 00:09:10.970
in front of the screen working,
and I would be making jokes

00:09:10.970 --> 00:09:11.990
to entertain them.

00:09:11.990 --> 00:09:16.038
That's basically my
first year in college.

00:09:16.038 --> 00:09:17.330
And then I went, you know what?

00:09:17.330 --> 00:09:19.640
Maybe I shouldn't be doing this.

00:09:19.640 --> 00:09:23.250
And I really had a talk with
my father and my mother.

00:09:23.250 --> 00:09:26.870
And I said, I know
I can do this.

00:09:26.870 --> 00:09:30.590
But I am not going to
be happy, and I'm not

00:09:30.590 --> 00:09:32.540
going to be able to
do this professionally

00:09:32.540 --> 00:09:33.750
for the rest of my life.

00:09:33.750 --> 00:09:36.800
So I really want to
go and study theater,

00:09:36.800 --> 00:09:38.840
because I think it
can help with magic.

00:09:38.840 --> 00:09:43.260
Which for my father loves magic,
my mother loves magic as well.

00:09:43.260 --> 00:09:46.550
But as a father and mother,
they were very worried

00:09:46.550 --> 00:09:47.420
about my future.

00:09:47.420 --> 00:09:52.340
So they really were like, if
he wants to be a magician,

00:09:52.340 --> 00:09:58.790
and his backup plan
is theater, you're not

00:09:58.790 --> 00:10:01.550
making right choices.

00:10:01.550 --> 00:10:03.800
But they finally
heard me, and they

00:10:03.800 --> 00:10:09.110
understand I was going
to pursue it anyway.

00:10:09.110 --> 00:10:10.160
So we made a pact.

00:10:10.160 --> 00:10:14.330
And the pact was, you
go to theater school.

00:10:14.330 --> 00:10:16.910
You have four
years to finish it.

00:10:16.910 --> 00:10:18.150
That's the degree length.

00:10:18.150 --> 00:10:21.800
So you have four
years to finish it.

00:10:21.800 --> 00:10:24.290
After the fourth year,
you have one year

00:10:24.290 --> 00:10:26.780
to become fully independent.

00:10:26.780 --> 00:10:30.830
If you can't do that, you
go back to computer science,

00:10:30.830 --> 00:10:32.480
and you finish the degree.

00:10:32.480 --> 00:10:34.920
And I go like, deal.

00:10:34.920 --> 00:10:37.468
So I went to theater school.

00:10:37.468 --> 00:10:38.510
Those are the four years.

00:10:38.510 --> 00:10:40.020
I've learned a lot.

00:10:40.020 --> 00:10:43.190
I've met other people that
were very like minded,

00:10:43.190 --> 00:10:45.860
not magician wise,
but they were trying

00:10:45.860 --> 00:10:50.480
to combine different things
with theater and performance art

00:10:50.480 --> 00:10:52.460
and dance, for example.

00:10:52.460 --> 00:10:54.170
And so all of the
sudden, I find myself

00:10:54.170 --> 00:10:56.420
that I'm in a group
of people that I can

00:10:56.420 --> 00:10:58.730
grow up with and learn from.

00:10:58.730 --> 00:11:02.780
During those four years,
I start doing small shows

00:11:02.780 --> 00:11:05.330
around my own town.

00:11:05.330 --> 00:11:06.890
I got a lot of stage time.

00:11:06.890 --> 00:11:08.555
That was a very helpful thing.

00:11:11.960 --> 00:11:14.402
I know this is a long
answer, but I warned you.

00:11:14.402 --> 00:11:15.110
SPEAKER: You did.

00:11:15.110 --> 00:11:16.850
HELDER GUIMARAES:
There was a place that

00:11:16.850 --> 00:11:19.490
was doing a lot of theater
shows and comedy shows,

00:11:19.490 --> 00:11:20.775
but they had no magic show.

00:11:20.775 --> 00:11:23.150
And a friend of mine was
working one of the comedy shows,

00:11:23.150 --> 00:11:25.430
and he said, you should
talk with this guy

00:11:25.430 --> 00:11:29.010
to see if he wants to
have you work there.

00:11:29.010 --> 00:11:29.510
OK.

00:11:29.510 --> 00:11:30.932
I went there.

00:11:30.932 --> 00:11:31.890
I said, I'm a magician.

00:11:31.890 --> 00:11:34.400
I would love to be able
to bring a show here.

00:11:34.400 --> 00:11:36.260
And he was like, eh,
we've had a magician.

00:11:36.260 --> 00:11:39.240
We really don't want magic.

00:11:39.240 --> 00:11:42.410
And I was like, OK,
how many music shows

00:11:42.410 --> 00:11:44.240
do you have here per month?

00:11:44.240 --> 00:11:45.350
Six, seven?

00:11:45.350 --> 00:11:50.120
And then I go, like, if you
had one bad music concert,

00:11:50.120 --> 00:11:52.127
would you stop doing music?

00:11:52.127 --> 00:11:53.210
And he kind of understood.

00:11:53.210 --> 00:11:55.880
So he brought me,
and I did a show.

00:11:55.880 --> 00:11:58.010
It was a room for 120 people.

00:11:58.010 --> 00:12:01.500
I think I had like
40 or 45 people.

00:12:01.500 --> 00:12:02.840
But I did a good show.

00:12:02.840 --> 00:12:03.800
He liked it.

00:12:03.800 --> 00:12:04.550
People liked it.

00:12:04.550 --> 00:12:06.570
He said come back with
the same show next month.

00:12:06.570 --> 00:12:08.270
So I brought the same show.

00:12:08.270 --> 00:12:10.247
Next month we had
like 60 people.

00:12:10.247 --> 00:12:12.080
And he said, well, if
you want to come back,

00:12:12.080 --> 00:12:14.100
you have to bring
a different show.

00:12:14.100 --> 00:12:16.620
But I'll give you two
dates on the same month.

00:12:16.620 --> 00:12:20.180
So the next month, I
create a full one hour

00:12:20.180 --> 00:12:24.770
show for the venue, different
than the one before.

00:12:24.770 --> 00:12:26.210
We did two dates.

00:12:26.210 --> 00:12:29.450
And he said, OK, bring the same
show back to the next month.

00:12:29.450 --> 00:12:32.480
OK, so now I'm doing the
same show four times.

00:12:32.480 --> 00:12:36.500
The fifth month, he tells me,
I can give you four dates,

00:12:36.500 --> 00:12:41.010
but you have to change
the show every month now.

00:12:41.010 --> 00:12:42.550
And I was like, you know what?

00:12:42.550 --> 00:12:43.680
Let's do it.

00:12:43.680 --> 00:12:49.040
So for two years, every month I
was doing a different one hour

00:12:49.040 --> 00:12:50.570
performance.

00:12:50.570 --> 00:12:53.960
And so that just give me
a lot of stage time doing

00:12:53.960 --> 00:12:56.270
what I like, creating things.

00:12:56.270 --> 00:13:02.000
So it just made me really
think about magic in a way

00:13:02.000 --> 00:13:04.160
that I still think
today, but it helped

00:13:04.160 --> 00:13:06.740
me just develop a lot of--

00:13:06.740 --> 00:13:09.560
you have no time
to make judgments

00:13:09.560 --> 00:13:12.500
if things are in the right way.

00:13:12.500 --> 00:13:14.660
So sometimes you get on
stage, and you get really

00:13:14.660 --> 00:13:15.903
awkward moments.

00:13:15.903 --> 00:13:16.820
But that was the time.

00:13:16.820 --> 00:13:17.880
That was the time to do it.

00:13:17.880 --> 00:13:19.338
That was the right
moment to do it.

00:13:19.338 --> 00:13:24.390
So those are the two years prior
to the World Champion of Magic.

00:13:24.390 --> 00:13:29.270
So I really was very comfortable
when it came to go there

00:13:29.270 --> 00:13:31.280
and just do 10 minutes.

00:13:31.280 --> 00:13:33.900
Because basically, that's
what you have to do.

00:13:33.900 --> 00:13:35.660
So I've been doing
one hour shows

00:13:35.660 --> 00:13:38.120
different for two years almost.

00:13:38.120 --> 00:13:41.750
So 10 minutes seemed like,
I think I can do this.

00:13:41.750 --> 00:13:44.660
But I wasn't super confident
that I'm going to go there,

00:13:44.660 --> 00:13:46.055
and I'm going to win.

00:13:46.055 --> 00:13:47.180
I wasn't confident on that.

00:13:47.180 --> 00:13:51.800
I just knew that I could
select 10 really good minutes

00:13:51.800 --> 00:13:55.875
to go there and have an impact.

00:13:55.875 --> 00:13:56.750
So that's what I did.

00:13:56.750 --> 00:14:01.610
I start working on the
routine a year before.

00:14:01.610 --> 00:14:04.040
I had the concept of
what I wanted to do.

00:14:04.040 --> 00:14:06.430
I started developing it.

00:14:06.430 --> 00:14:11.240
I went to a couple of
competitions, one in Spain,

00:14:11.240 --> 00:14:13.850
where I actually won
the prize as well,

00:14:13.850 --> 00:14:18.990
and another one in England,
where I didn't even place.

00:14:18.990 --> 00:14:20.300
Which is fine.

00:14:20.300 --> 00:14:22.280
That's how things are.

00:14:22.280 --> 00:14:24.560
And then I go to the
World Championship in 2006

00:14:24.560 --> 00:14:27.380
in Sweden, Stockholm.

00:14:27.380 --> 00:14:29.940
I go inside of the room--

00:14:29.940 --> 00:14:35.110
well actually, five
minutes before there

00:14:35.110 --> 00:14:38.560
was this moment
where technically I

00:14:38.560 --> 00:14:43.510
should be extremely nervous,
but I was extremely calm.

00:14:43.510 --> 00:14:45.730
And I don't even
know why, because I

00:14:45.730 --> 00:14:48.893
didn't have that much
experience at the time.

00:14:48.893 --> 00:14:51.310
But I just had this moment
where it's like, you know what?

00:14:51.310 --> 00:14:52.330
Just have fun.

00:14:52.330 --> 00:14:54.370
Just go out there, have fun.

00:14:54.370 --> 00:14:56.230
So I entered the room.

00:14:56.230 --> 00:14:59.080
I would say that from--

00:14:59.080 --> 00:15:04.780
so it's 3,000
magicians watching you.

00:15:04.780 --> 00:15:08.320
Although the room for what I
do-- because I do it close up,

00:15:08.320 --> 00:15:12.670
the room I think maybe would
sit 200 people I would say.

00:15:12.670 --> 00:15:14.410
But there were
monitors broadcasting

00:15:14.410 --> 00:15:16.580
to other rooms and outside.

00:15:16.580 --> 00:15:21.870
So from those 200 people,
maybe 20 people knew who I was.

00:15:21.870 --> 00:15:23.800
So I got in the room.

00:15:23.800 --> 00:15:25.840
I get a nice round of applause.

00:15:25.840 --> 00:15:27.040
People welcomed me.

00:15:27.040 --> 00:15:28.630
I go.

00:15:28.630 --> 00:15:31.120
I don't remember
anything I've done.

00:15:31.120 --> 00:15:36.400
So in my head, it was just
like, fuck it [INAUDIBLE]..

00:15:36.400 --> 00:15:37.600
I don't know.

00:15:37.600 --> 00:15:41.260
And all I know is at the end,
I'm having a standing ovation.

00:15:41.260 --> 00:15:43.490
And I'm coming out of that room.

00:15:43.490 --> 00:15:47.050
And as I walk outside, I
have people coming to me

00:15:47.050 --> 00:15:51.760
and go like, what the
fuck just happened?

00:15:51.760 --> 00:15:54.670
And it was just this
very surreal moment

00:15:54.670 --> 00:16:01.390
because what I was at
that moment didn't change.

00:16:01.390 --> 00:16:03.370
That was who I was.

00:16:03.370 --> 00:16:07.180
But all of the sudden, there
were 3,000 magicians that knew

00:16:07.180 --> 00:16:10.060
my name, that 10
minutes before didn't.

00:16:10.060 --> 00:16:13.120
And that was kind
of an eye opener,

00:16:13.120 --> 00:16:15.830
that sometimes it's
not who you are,

00:16:15.830 --> 00:16:19.420
but it's how people see you
that really changes and makes

00:16:19.420 --> 00:16:21.010
an impact.

00:16:21.010 --> 00:16:25.630
Two days after that, they
announced the winners.

00:16:25.630 --> 00:16:30.490
And actually I knew I won before
they announced, because there

00:16:30.490 --> 00:16:34.870
is this moment at the end of the
convention where the winners go

00:16:34.870 --> 00:16:37.720
on stage, and they
perform for everyone.

00:16:37.720 --> 00:16:40.570
And normally they
have everyone that

00:16:40.570 --> 00:16:45.520
got more than 80 points
on score to perform.

00:16:45.520 --> 00:16:48.123
So even if you
have more than 80,

00:16:48.123 --> 00:16:49.540
it doesn't mean
you are the first.

00:16:49.540 --> 00:16:52.210
Because if in your category
two people have more than that,

00:16:52.210 --> 00:16:54.160
one is first, and the
other one is second.

00:16:54.160 --> 00:16:56.822
But in my category,
I was the only one

00:16:56.822 --> 00:16:58.030
that got more than 80 points.

00:16:58.030 --> 00:16:59.405
So when they
announced the names,

00:16:59.405 --> 00:17:03.430
it was very clear
that oh, I've won.

00:17:03.430 --> 00:17:06.160
I wasn't even in the
room when they did that.

00:17:06.160 --> 00:17:09.040
So my parents were there.

00:17:09.040 --> 00:17:11.660
So they heard it.

00:17:11.660 --> 00:17:15.520
And they came out running
looking for me on the halls

00:17:15.520 --> 00:17:17.260
of the Convention Center.

00:17:17.260 --> 00:17:20.560
And I'm just walking with
a deck of cards in my hand,

00:17:20.560 --> 00:17:22.810
just walking.

00:17:22.810 --> 00:17:26.619
And all of a sudden
I see my mother--

00:17:26.619 --> 00:17:27.670
my father wasn't there--

00:17:27.670 --> 00:17:31.840
my mother running with a bunch
of other Portuguese people

00:17:31.840 --> 00:17:34.410
around her going like, you won!

00:17:34.410 --> 00:17:35.410
You won!

00:17:35.410 --> 00:17:37.780
And I'm like, what happened?

00:17:37.780 --> 00:17:38.750
I'm not aware.

00:17:38.750 --> 00:17:40.948
I think tomorrow is
the award ceremony.

00:17:40.948 --> 00:17:42.990
So I'm like, in my head
it's like, what happened?

00:17:42.990 --> 00:17:44.698
No, you're going to
go to the final gala.

00:17:44.698 --> 00:17:46.090
So you won.

00:17:46.090 --> 00:17:47.570
You are the only one--

00:17:47.570 --> 00:17:49.720
and so someone
kind of blocks me,

00:17:49.720 --> 00:17:51.490
and explains to
me what happened.

00:17:51.490 --> 00:17:53.260
And I was like, oh.

00:17:53.260 --> 00:17:55.720
And all of a
sudden, that dream--

00:17:55.720 --> 00:17:57.760
because to be honest
with you, I never

00:17:57.760 --> 00:18:01.120
wanted to have the title,
World Champion of Magic.

00:18:01.120 --> 00:18:02.440
That didn't matter to me.

00:18:02.440 --> 00:18:05.050
But there were other
people in that list

00:18:05.050 --> 00:18:08.140
of winners that were
mentors of mine,

00:18:08.140 --> 00:18:10.660
and people I really admired.

00:18:10.660 --> 00:18:13.510
And so for me, it
was more I made

00:18:13.510 --> 00:18:15.580
the list with people I admire.

00:18:15.580 --> 00:18:22.240
And so when I realized that, I
was so happy and really nervous

00:18:22.240 --> 00:18:26.420
because now you have to perform
as the World Champion of Magic.

00:18:26.420 --> 00:18:28.840
So it's a very
different stake now.

00:18:28.840 --> 00:18:31.570
But everything went fine.

00:18:31.570 --> 00:18:37.720
And so after that, I start
having calls and emails

00:18:37.720 --> 00:18:41.620
about going to Japan,
Australia, United States.

00:18:41.620 --> 00:18:43.540
My first travel to
the United States

00:18:43.540 --> 00:18:46.240
was because I won that prize.

00:18:46.240 --> 00:18:50.080
And I got booked
to do shows here.

00:18:50.080 --> 00:18:53.090
So another very long answer.

00:18:53.090 --> 00:18:54.600
SPEAKER: No, that's good.

00:18:54.600 --> 00:18:55.617
That's why we're here.

00:18:55.617 --> 00:18:56.950
They don't want to hear me talk.

00:18:59.750 --> 00:19:02.290
So getting back to your shows--

00:19:02.290 --> 00:19:04.780
and sounds like you're very
practiced creating shows--

00:19:04.780 --> 00:19:06.340
much of what you
do, sleight of hand,

00:19:06.340 --> 00:19:10.090
it's very up close, very
personal, as opposed to you're

00:19:10.090 --> 00:19:14.410
on a stage making
cars disappear.

00:19:14.410 --> 00:19:17.260
So how does that impact
the design of your shows,

00:19:17.260 --> 00:19:20.590
or what kind of performances
you choose to create?

00:19:20.590 --> 00:19:25.906
HELDER GUIMARAES: It's just the
type of thing I'm attracted to.

00:19:25.906 --> 00:19:30.730
I've always loved--
since I saw that show

00:19:30.730 --> 00:19:35.500
I mentioned in Madrid, I
really like the interaction

00:19:35.500 --> 00:19:36.790
with the audience.

00:19:36.790 --> 00:19:42.200
I really like the
fact that I never

00:19:42.200 --> 00:19:46.230
know what the audience is
going to do when I ask them.

00:19:46.230 --> 00:19:48.420
Even if it's a simple
thing or common gesture,

00:19:48.420 --> 00:19:50.450
just as pick a card.

00:19:50.450 --> 00:19:54.680
If I've told you all the
answers I've got from just that.

00:19:54.680 --> 00:19:57.680
You have the plain one,
which is just people actually

00:19:57.680 --> 00:20:00.140
go like, OK, let's collaborate.

00:20:00.140 --> 00:20:02.810
Other people go like, no,
no, no, no, no, no, no.

00:20:02.810 --> 00:20:06.770
I-- and then they start
like just messing around.

00:20:06.770 --> 00:20:07.670
You never know.

00:20:07.670 --> 00:20:10.970
And that for me is
really exciting.

00:20:10.970 --> 00:20:12.210
Because that's kind of life.

00:20:12.210 --> 00:20:12.710
You know?

00:20:12.710 --> 00:20:14.060
You never know.

00:20:14.060 --> 00:20:18.740
So I love that my shows have
that interaction component.

00:20:18.740 --> 00:20:23.210
Then there is the part of me
loving playing cards per se.

00:20:23.210 --> 00:20:25.040
I love the object.

00:20:25.040 --> 00:20:33.110
It's the symbolic side of
it, the fact that it evolved

00:20:33.110 --> 00:20:37.490
and through ages, but got
to a point where now a deck

00:20:37.490 --> 00:20:39.158
of cards, it's what it is.

00:20:39.158 --> 00:20:40.700
And it's never going
to change again.

00:20:40.700 --> 00:20:43.940
It's almost like a
perfect object in itself.

00:20:46.460 --> 00:20:50.600
And the variety
of things you can

00:20:50.600 --> 00:20:53.390
accomplish with
that unique object,

00:20:53.390 --> 00:20:56.360
that's the other part
that attracts me.

00:20:56.360 --> 00:21:00.350
And so all those
things combined end up

00:21:00.350 --> 00:21:03.860
making me want to
design my experiences

00:21:03.860 --> 00:21:05.810
around those things.

00:21:05.810 --> 00:21:10.070
A deck of cards, which means
that either you have a camera

00:21:10.070 --> 00:21:15.290
and projection, and then you can
have a bigger audience watching

00:21:15.290 --> 00:21:16.850
you.

00:21:16.850 --> 00:21:19.910
And I prefer not to, because
I think the camera always

00:21:19.910 --> 00:21:23.130
distance a little bit people
from the actual experience.

00:21:23.130 --> 00:21:25.220
So that means that
you have to design

00:21:25.220 --> 00:21:27.960
the experience for people
to be able to be near you

00:21:27.960 --> 00:21:29.540
and be able to see it.

00:21:32.520 --> 00:21:34.250
And then the interaction part.

00:21:34.250 --> 00:21:38.600
I don't want to be on a stage
where I can't actually have

00:21:38.600 --> 00:21:41.540
someone touch what I'm doing.

00:21:41.540 --> 00:21:45.750
So all those things
combined make that--

00:21:45.750 --> 00:21:50.010
I could have a car
on stage, but that

00:21:50.010 --> 00:21:54.600
would be the full stage
would be the size of the car.

00:21:54.600 --> 00:21:58.620
So it would not
be very practical.

00:21:58.620 --> 00:22:02.370
So I just want that
proximity to be part of it.

00:22:02.370 --> 00:22:06.120
And of course, that makes that--

00:22:06.120 --> 00:22:11.730
the next step about
it is, you end up

00:22:11.730 --> 00:22:13.830
deciding on things
that are very personal.

00:22:13.830 --> 00:22:17.550
And you end up telling stories
that are part of your life,

00:22:17.550 --> 00:22:20.100
and stories that can
make the audience

00:22:20.100 --> 00:22:22.830
relate to who you
are as a performer.

00:22:22.830 --> 00:22:29.490
And all those things combine
with my background in theater

00:22:29.490 --> 00:22:32.940
and me liking the
sense of humor,

00:22:32.940 --> 00:22:36.030
end up me mixing
all those things

00:22:36.030 --> 00:22:42.480
and just doing all the
things I like together.

00:22:42.480 --> 00:22:44.040
I'm very excited
about every time

00:22:44.040 --> 00:22:48.660
I'm creating a new
show, because I get--

00:22:48.660 --> 00:22:54.415
I think it's where
I feel more myself.

00:22:54.415 --> 00:22:59.160
I can't say I'm a shy
person, but I'm not

00:22:59.160 --> 00:23:03.570
as overt or as expansive
as I am on stage,

00:23:03.570 --> 00:23:04.980
when I'm out off stage.

00:23:04.980 --> 00:23:08.220
I have a bunch of funny
stories of people meeting me

00:23:08.220 --> 00:23:13.860
after shows and not realizing
it's me, because they go, how

00:23:13.860 --> 00:23:16.740
can you be the same
person that goes on stage

00:23:16.740 --> 00:23:20.790
and says all those things
and is so open about it,

00:23:20.790 --> 00:23:23.180
and then in here,
in the table, you

00:23:23.180 --> 00:23:27.300
are the only person
that was not speaking?

00:23:27.300 --> 00:23:30.600
And that is something
that changes me a bit,

00:23:30.600 --> 00:23:35.190
is when I go on stage, I
just become more comfortable.

00:23:35.190 --> 00:23:37.680
And I can't really explain why.

00:23:37.680 --> 00:23:38.590
SPEAKER: Makes sense.

00:23:38.590 --> 00:23:41.820
And so you described
yourself as a storyteller.

00:23:41.820 --> 00:23:44.960
And many of your shows,
you like to explore themes.

00:23:44.960 --> 00:23:47.370
"Invisible Tango"
is about mystery.

00:23:47.370 --> 00:23:51.010
Your last one, "Borrowed
Time," was about memory.

00:23:51.010 --> 00:23:54.510
So how does magic help
you tell the stories

00:23:54.510 --> 00:23:55.560
that you want to tell?

00:23:58.048 --> 00:23:59.590
HELDER GUIMARAES:
I don't think magic

00:23:59.590 --> 00:24:02.290
helps necessarily
tell the story,

00:24:02.290 --> 00:24:10.280
but gives it a perspective on
those themes and on who I am.

00:24:10.280 --> 00:24:16.570
And this is something
that it's easy to relate,

00:24:16.570 --> 00:24:19.860
but it's not necessarily
easy to explain.

00:24:19.860 --> 00:24:25.510
I look at things around
me as illusions or magic.

00:24:25.510 --> 00:24:27.990
So I'm always trying
to understand, where

00:24:27.990 --> 00:24:30.060
is something I'm not seeing?

00:24:30.060 --> 00:24:35.040
Or how I am seeing this, but
actually if I go to that angle,

00:24:35.040 --> 00:24:36.660
it looks different.

00:24:36.660 --> 00:24:40.570
I do that every 10
minutes in my life.

00:24:40.570 --> 00:24:47.400
So that's something I'm just
interested in, how people craft

00:24:47.400 --> 00:24:50.760
realities so that
you think it's real,

00:24:50.760 --> 00:24:54.450
but it's actually
what someone else did

00:24:54.450 --> 00:24:57.270
for you to believe it's real.

00:24:57.270 --> 00:25:03.210
Not going further, but just
look at politics and how that

00:25:03.210 --> 00:25:06.180
works on that specific area.

00:25:06.180 --> 00:25:10.620
So that happens in every
single thing in our life.

00:25:10.620 --> 00:25:12.780
And we just don't think
too much about that.

00:25:12.780 --> 00:25:14.680
I like to think about that.

00:25:14.680 --> 00:25:17.940
So when I approach those
subjects, like memory

00:25:17.940 --> 00:25:21.540
for example, or
mystery, I try to see it

00:25:21.540 --> 00:25:25.170
from the angle of a
magician looking at it.

00:25:25.170 --> 00:25:28.500
And so magic just is
a language that allows

00:25:28.500 --> 00:25:30.270
me to communicate those ideas.

00:25:32.880 --> 00:25:40.910
And because I incorporate other
things, like humor and theater,

00:25:40.910 --> 00:25:45.870
I can explore different
sides of the same theme,

00:25:45.870 --> 00:25:48.990
according to those
different languages,

00:25:48.990 --> 00:25:52.120
and create kind of
a unique moment.

00:25:52.120 --> 00:25:55.380
But for me, magic is not
different than theater

00:25:55.380 --> 00:25:55.950
or comedy.

00:25:55.950 --> 00:25:58.620
It's just an artistic
language that allows

00:25:58.620 --> 00:26:01.650
you to express a point of view.

00:26:01.650 --> 00:26:05.460
And eventually, my shows
have a point of view

00:26:05.460 --> 00:26:07.380
that is mine, because
I'm the one creating

00:26:07.380 --> 00:26:09.550
them and performing them.

00:26:09.550 --> 00:26:13.560
But I also always want the shows
to be open to interpretation

00:26:13.560 --> 00:26:17.040
so that whenever you bring
your own vision to what

00:26:17.040 --> 00:26:21.570
you're seeing, you
can make a decision.

00:26:21.570 --> 00:26:24.780
Or at least--

00:26:24.780 --> 00:26:29.280
I heard one time someone,
a plastic artist,

00:26:29.280 --> 00:26:33.600
that was saying, I
want people to come out

00:26:33.600 --> 00:26:38.280
of seeing my work with more
doubts than when they got in.

00:26:38.280 --> 00:26:41.190
And I don't
necessarily want people

00:26:41.190 --> 00:26:43.530
to be doubting all
their life when

00:26:43.530 --> 00:26:45.360
they go to see a show of mine.

00:26:45.360 --> 00:26:47.880
I think that's kind of
not very productive.

00:26:47.880 --> 00:26:51.240
But if you can question one
little thing in your life,

00:26:51.240 --> 00:26:53.940
that the next day you have to
make a decision [INAUDIBLE]

00:26:53.940 --> 00:26:55.305
you know what?

00:26:55.305 --> 00:26:57.180
Maybe there is something
here for me to think

00:26:57.180 --> 00:26:58.830
that I've never thought about.

00:26:58.830 --> 00:27:00.040
I'm happy with that.

00:27:00.040 --> 00:27:02.610
If you go out of my
show, and you go,

00:27:02.610 --> 00:27:05.130
I really had a great
time, that is something

00:27:05.130 --> 00:27:08.250
I'm very pleased about too.

00:27:08.250 --> 00:27:10.530
I think entertainment
for itself,

00:27:10.530 --> 00:27:15.240
it's something very valuable.

00:27:15.240 --> 00:27:19.290
But I always want people to
take something out of the show

00:27:19.290 --> 00:27:20.820
when they go.

00:27:20.820 --> 00:27:23.280
And I don't want them to
go, this is the truth.

00:27:23.280 --> 00:27:26.530
Because I don't believe
there is one truth.

00:27:26.530 --> 00:27:30.450
So if you can just get
one question in your life

00:27:30.450 --> 00:27:32.030
that you've never
thought before,

00:27:32.030 --> 00:27:34.720
I would be happy about that.

00:27:34.720 --> 00:27:35.220
SPEAKER: OK.

00:27:35.220 --> 00:27:36.178
Interesting, thank you.

00:27:36.178 --> 00:27:38.070
And so you touched
on this briefly.

00:27:38.070 --> 00:27:40.080
So when you're
designing a new trick,

00:27:40.080 --> 00:27:43.080
you're taking inspiration
from the world around you

00:27:43.080 --> 00:27:43.710
to some extent.

00:27:43.710 --> 00:27:45.840
For art, you can paint
what's in front of you.

00:27:45.840 --> 00:27:50.310
Comedy you can tell
stories from your life.

00:27:50.310 --> 00:27:52.800
How do you take your
inspiration and kind of

00:27:52.800 --> 00:27:58.790
transform it into the deck of
cards and the actual trick?

00:27:58.790 --> 00:28:01.260
HELDER GUIMARAES: I think it's
all a question of metaphors.

00:28:05.630 --> 00:28:14.040
I'll give you an example of
a moment that I [INAUDIBLE]

00:28:14.040 --> 00:28:18.430
a spectator in a
magic performance

00:28:18.430 --> 00:28:26.860
that I think illustrates
how I see it.

00:28:26.860 --> 00:28:30.880
And it was from actually my
mentor, or one of my mentors,

00:28:30.880 --> 00:28:34.060
the person who I
saw when I was 12.

00:28:34.060 --> 00:28:36.880
He has a moment in one
of his performances

00:28:36.880 --> 00:28:39.910
where he makes a
deck of cards vanish.

00:28:39.910 --> 00:28:41.562
And that's the moment.

00:28:41.562 --> 00:28:42.520
He has a deck of cards.

00:28:42.520 --> 00:28:43.960
It's between his hands.

00:28:43.960 --> 00:28:46.690
People are grabbing him around.

00:28:46.690 --> 00:28:50.280
And then when he opens his
hands, the deck is not there.

00:28:50.280 --> 00:28:52.750
Sorry, when he opens his
hands, the deck is not there.

00:28:56.170 --> 00:28:58.810
And that for itself,
it's just a magic moment.

00:28:58.810 --> 00:29:00.820
Everyone reacts.

00:29:00.820 --> 00:29:04.300
And the next question
is, where the deck is.

00:29:04.300 --> 00:29:06.400
Everyone goes for that question.

00:29:06.400 --> 00:29:11.260
And he explores that in
a way that is not magic.

00:29:11.260 --> 00:29:13.390
It's really theatrical.

00:29:13.390 --> 00:29:17.140
Because he makes you believe
that the deck is going

00:29:17.140 --> 00:29:20.410
to reappear, and it doesn't.

00:29:20.410 --> 00:29:26.250
And then when you think, OK,
then he makes you believe again

00:29:26.250 --> 00:29:29.790
the deck is going to reappear
in another part, and it doesn't.

00:29:29.790 --> 00:29:34.530
And all of the sudden,
for the next five minutes,

00:29:34.530 --> 00:29:38.610
you are reliving the
fact that the deck is not

00:29:38.610 --> 00:29:40.570
going to come back.

00:29:40.570 --> 00:29:46.480
And it's funny if you
think about it now.

00:29:46.480 --> 00:29:51.150
But in the moment you live it,
it's kind of like you feel bad.

00:29:51.150 --> 00:29:53.880
Because you go like, oh.

00:29:53.880 --> 00:29:55.870
And you feel incomplete.

00:29:55.870 --> 00:29:58.980
And that's what you wanted
to explore with that moment.

00:29:58.980 --> 00:30:00.840
It's that the
audience would have

00:30:00.840 --> 00:30:03.540
the sense of incompleteness.

00:30:03.540 --> 00:30:08.940
So things like that is how you
can transform certain feelings

00:30:08.940 --> 00:30:11.340
that you want to
create in your audience

00:30:11.340 --> 00:30:14.820
and actually make it in a
show or in a performance,

00:30:14.820 --> 00:30:18.800
and translate that
to a magic language.

00:30:18.800 --> 00:30:22.350
And I think that's just a very
simple example to understand.

00:30:22.350 --> 00:30:24.150
But there are other
things that you

00:30:24.150 --> 00:30:27.090
can do with magic
along the same lines.

00:30:27.090 --> 00:30:29.700
It's just a question of--

00:30:29.700 --> 00:30:31.890
so like I said, what
I like about magic

00:30:31.890 --> 00:30:35.310
is the fact that when I
interact with the audience,

00:30:35.310 --> 00:30:38.010
I never know what
is coming back.

00:30:38.010 --> 00:30:42.990
But also, magic happens in the
now, happens in the moment.

00:30:42.990 --> 00:30:44.460
That's one of the
big differences

00:30:44.460 --> 00:30:49.610
between a theater play in a
common sense and a magic show.

00:30:49.610 --> 00:30:52.170
Because in a theater
play, you understand

00:30:52.170 --> 00:30:55.620
there is this time line that
people are representing.

00:30:55.620 --> 00:30:58.110
And at one point, you
get in, and you actually

00:30:58.110 --> 00:31:00.090
want to know what happens
next in the story.

00:31:00.090 --> 00:31:04.320
But you know that they are
representing something else.

00:31:04.320 --> 00:31:08.430
In magic, if I am talking with
you, I am talking with you.

00:31:08.430 --> 00:31:11.440
It's not like the character
that is talking with you.

00:31:11.440 --> 00:31:13.470
And the same thing
with the moment.

00:31:13.470 --> 00:31:17.010
This is not
representing something.

00:31:17.010 --> 00:31:18.720
This is happening now.

00:31:18.720 --> 00:31:21.900
And that moment where
you share the same space

00:31:21.900 --> 00:31:26.650
with an audience,
and you can actually

00:31:26.650 --> 00:31:30.100
talk with them in that
moment, and they know that

00:31:30.100 --> 00:31:32.860
is happening then, and
it's never happening again.

00:31:32.860 --> 00:31:34.780
Because if it happens
again, it's always

00:31:34.780 --> 00:31:36.370
going to be slightly different.

00:31:36.370 --> 00:31:40.060
That is something that--

00:31:40.060 --> 00:31:40.990
I like that.

00:31:40.990 --> 00:31:47.920
So I like to use those moments
in the show to actually create

00:31:47.920 --> 00:31:52.090
feelings and
sensations and pushing

00:31:52.090 --> 00:31:57.220
a little bit the boundary of
what can be done with magic.

00:31:57.220 --> 00:31:58.810
SPEAKER: Thank you.

00:31:58.810 --> 00:32:02.610
So pivoting a little bit to
a different kind of magic,

00:32:02.610 --> 00:32:04.720
the magic of the big screen.

00:32:04.720 --> 00:32:08.625
You recently got done-- you were
a consultant on "Ocean's 8."

00:32:08.625 --> 00:32:10.000
Can you tell me
a little bit more

00:32:10.000 --> 00:32:13.163
about the role you played there?

00:32:13.163 --> 00:32:14.080
HELDER GUIMARAES: Yes.

00:32:14.080 --> 00:32:17.750
So I'm in New York.

00:32:17.750 --> 00:32:19.430
I'm doing a show.

00:32:19.430 --> 00:32:23.720
And all of the
sudden, I got an email

00:32:23.720 --> 00:32:27.680
from someone who
watched the show saying,

00:32:27.680 --> 00:32:30.650
we're doing this movie.

00:32:30.650 --> 00:32:39.080
And we have a part of the script
that we would like for someone,

00:32:39.080 --> 00:32:43.540
some people that are
related to deception,

00:32:43.540 --> 00:32:49.430
to read about and make sure
that we got this right.

00:32:49.430 --> 00:32:51.950
And at that point, I had
no idea what movie it was.

00:32:51.950 --> 00:32:55.910
So then I got on the
phone, and then I

00:32:55.910 --> 00:33:01.820
realized it's an "Ocean's
Eleven" spin-off with women.

00:33:01.820 --> 00:33:03.990
It's going to be
called "Ocean's 8."

00:33:03.990 --> 00:33:05.240
I know nothing about the cast.

00:33:05.240 --> 00:33:07.880
I didn't even know the
movie was in production.

00:33:07.880 --> 00:33:11.390
But the movie was going to be--

00:33:11.390 --> 00:33:13.820
the headquarters for the
movie shot was in New York.

00:33:13.820 --> 00:33:22.250
So I basically met with the
director, the co-writer--

00:33:22.250 --> 00:33:24.740
because the director also
wrote-- so the director,

00:33:24.740 --> 00:33:28.070
the co-writer, and a producer.

00:33:28.070 --> 00:33:30.380
And we basically have
a brief conversation

00:33:30.380 --> 00:33:33.980
about that small
part of the script.

00:33:33.980 --> 00:33:36.650
And I explained, you know what?

00:33:36.650 --> 00:33:39.380
In real life, this can be
done like this, or like this,

00:33:39.380 --> 00:33:40.670
or like this.

00:33:40.670 --> 00:33:45.260
And something that they thought
could just happen in one way,

00:33:45.260 --> 00:33:48.170
I gave them like seven or
eight different options

00:33:48.170 --> 00:33:50.900
of how that can actually
happen in real life.

00:33:50.900 --> 00:33:56.840
And it's about a con, which
is something I really like.

00:33:56.840 --> 00:34:00.855
Not as a practitioner,
but as someone--

00:34:00.855 --> 00:34:01.730
SPEAKER: [INAUDIBLE].

00:34:01.730 --> 00:34:03.720
HELDER GUIMARAES:
Yeah, but I just find

00:34:03.720 --> 00:34:08.659
the psychology of con
artists very fascinating.

00:34:08.659 --> 00:34:12.550
So I've studied it for a time.

00:34:12.550 --> 00:34:14.050
And so when I got
there, I go, yeah,

00:34:14.050 --> 00:34:16.258
it can be done like this,
or like this, or like this.

00:34:16.258 --> 00:34:18.929
And all of the sudden, it's
like I opened the door for them.

00:34:18.929 --> 00:34:23.219
Like we didn't even know
that that was possible.

00:34:23.219 --> 00:34:27.750
So they invited me at that
point not just for that scene,

00:34:27.750 --> 00:34:29.230
but they said, you know what?

00:34:29.230 --> 00:34:33.350
It would be great if you
could work with the actresses

00:34:33.350 --> 00:34:37.699
on helping them understand how
the psychology of deception

00:34:37.699 --> 00:34:38.909
works.

00:34:38.909 --> 00:34:42.179
And so that's why
I got brought in.

00:34:42.179 --> 00:34:44.602
And so then that's
when I found out

00:34:44.602 --> 00:34:47.060
that I was going to be working
with Sandra Bullock and Cate

00:34:47.060 --> 00:34:52.110
Blanchett, teaching them
some sleight of hand,

00:34:52.110 --> 00:34:58.180
and teaching them the psychology
of pickpocket and things

00:34:58.180 --> 00:34:58.680
like that.

00:34:58.680 --> 00:35:03.900
So they brought me
basically on that role.

00:35:03.900 --> 00:35:07.880
And so it was just a very
surreal experience to meet,

00:35:07.880 --> 00:35:10.670
all of the sudden
be teaching all

00:35:10.670 --> 00:35:14.690
these amazing
actresses something.

00:35:14.690 --> 00:35:19.790
And then I got to be on
the floor of the filming

00:35:19.790 --> 00:35:21.613
on a couple of scenes.

00:35:21.613 --> 00:35:22.280
And that was it.

00:35:22.280 --> 00:35:23.420
It was really fun.

00:35:23.420 --> 00:35:25.350
SPEAKER: And so correct
me if I'm wrong.

00:35:25.350 --> 00:35:28.110
So also you actually
taught Sandra Bullock

00:35:28.110 --> 00:35:30.883
how to pick pockets and
set her on the director.

00:35:30.883 --> 00:35:31.800
HELDER GUIMARAES: Yes.

00:35:31.800 --> 00:35:34.650
So I don't know if you
guys saw the movie.

00:35:34.650 --> 00:35:35.407
SPEAKER: Not yet.

00:35:35.407 --> 00:35:36.990
HELDER GUIMARAES:
But there is a scene

00:35:36.990 --> 00:35:42.870
in the movie where she
actually does not pick pocket,

00:35:42.870 --> 00:35:47.410
but does something that
is pickpocket related.

00:35:47.410 --> 00:35:50.380
And they just wanted to--
of course, in a movie,

00:35:50.380 --> 00:35:51.720
it's all made up.

00:35:51.720 --> 00:35:54.835
But they just wanted
to have the feeling of,

00:35:54.835 --> 00:35:56.460
if we're going to do
this in real life,

00:35:56.460 --> 00:35:58.210
how would this be done?

00:35:58.210 --> 00:36:03.870
And so basically we staged
that moment to look like,

00:36:03.870 --> 00:36:09.240
yes, this could actually
happen in real life.

00:36:09.240 --> 00:36:11.097
So yes, so that's true.

00:36:11.097 --> 00:36:11.680
SPEAKER: Yeah.

00:36:11.680 --> 00:36:15.240
And so you mentioned briefly,
but in a movie, you have cuts.

00:36:15.240 --> 00:36:16.680
You have editing.

00:36:16.680 --> 00:36:20.250
You don't actually have
to pick the pocket.

00:36:20.250 --> 00:36:25.820
So then does having you
bring your expertise in kind

00:36:25.820 --> 00:36:29.450
of physical misdirection,
sleight of hand,

00:36:29.450 --> 00:36:32.120
just help the audience stay
more engaged or believable,

00:36:32.120 --> 00:36:34.442
or what does that bring?

00:36:34.442 --> 00:36:35.900
HELDER GUIMARAES:
I think it's just

00:36:35.900 --> 00:36:38.720
a question of that, is
like how can you shoot this

00:36:38.720 --> 00:36:43.020
so that this looks real,
but works on camera?

00:36:43.020 --> 00:36:47.060
And I think my role on
a couple of the moments

00:36:47.060 --> 00:36:50.060
were that, was like,
how can we shoot this

00:36:50.060 --> 00:36:54.230
so that it looks good on camera,
and it's actually close to what

00:36:54.230 --> 00:36:58.100
would happen in real life?

00:36:58.100 --> 00:37:00.020
It's less about make--

00:37:00.020 --> 00:37:02.750
and this movie was a very
particularly [INAUDIBLE],,

00:37:02.750 --> 00:37:05.990
because I'm not doing
actually magic to the movie,

00:37:05.990 --> 00:37:08.630
or not creating magic to
be happening in the movie.

00:37:08.630 --> 00:37:12.840
It's more a question of, how
would this happen in real life?

00:37:12.840 --> 00:37:17.360
Let's try to reproduce
this in a movie sequence.

00:37:17.360 --> 00:37:22.080
And shot it in a way that
story wise it makes sense.

00:37:22.080 --> 00:37:24.920
People can follow that.

00:37:24.920 --> 00:37:26.780
I don't know if anyone
here saw the movie,

00:37:26.780 --> 00:37:30.680
but there is an opening scene
where she goes in a store,

00:37:30.680 --> 00:37:32.810
and she steals a
couple of things.

00:37:32.810 --> 00:37:38.300
How that is done tells
a story to the audience,

00:37:38.300 --> 00:37:42.440
that when the moment
of the con happens,

00:37:42.440 --> 00:37:46.660
the audience can be on her side.

00:37:46.660 --> 00:37:49.190
And if the audience
is on her side,

00:37:49.190 --> 00:37:52.580
the reaction is much better
than if they are still

00:37:52.580 --> 00:37:54.500
figuring out what is happening.

00:37:54.500 --> 00:37:57.530
So those little
things, they really

00:37:57.530 --> 00:37:59.610
matter when you're
making a movie.

00:37:59.610 --> 00:38:02.990
And so I try to help as
best as to my knowledge

00:38:02.990 --> 00:38:06.848
to things like that.

00:38:06.848 --> 00:38:07.640
SPEAKER: Wonderful.

00:38:07.640 --> 00:38:08.300
Thank you very much.

00:38:08.300 --> 00:38:10.383
So I'd just like to remind
everybody, his new show

00:38:10.383 --> 00:38:13.550
premieres at the Geffen
Playhouse in May.

00:38:13.550 --> 00:38:16.120
So we have some time
to take some questions

00:38:16.120 --> 00:38:16.870
from the audience.

00:38:16.870 --> 00:38:17.833
So just--

00:38:17.833 --> 00:38:20.250
HELDER GUIMARAES: Yes, I would
just like to say something.

00:38:20.250 --> 00:38:22.650
So I'm really happy to be here.

00:38:22.650 --> 00:38:26.840
Thank you very much for inviting
me, before we go into Q&amp;A.

00:38:26.840 --> 00:38:29.180
But because of that, I
talked with the Geffen,

00:38:29.180 --> 00:38:33.795
and basically they made a
promo code that is googletalks.

00:38:33.795 --> 00:38:36.170
So if you go on the website,
and you want to buy tickets,

00:38:36.170 --> 00:38:39.620
and you put googletalks,
you get 20% off discount.

00:38:39.620 --> 00:38:42.438
SPEAKER: Does that work if
we already bought tickets?

00:38:42.438 --> 00:38:43.730
HELDER GUIMARAES: I don't know.

00:38:43.730 --> 00:38:45.720
That you have to
talk with the Geffen.

00:38:45.720 --> 00:38:50.520
I don't think that is
retroactive things.

00:38:50.520 --> 00:38:51.380
SPEAKER: Oh.

00:38:51.380 --> 00:38:53.270
Thank you.

00:38:53.270 --> 00:38:54.622
HELDER GUIMARAES: My pleasure.

00:38:54.622 --> 00:38:58.705
[APPLAUSE]

00:38:58.705 --> 00:39:01.080
SPEAKER: Just raise your hands
if you have any questions.

00:39:01.080 --> 00:39:02.350
We'll fastball the mic at you.

00:39:05.960 --> 00:39:07.350
HELDER GUIMARAES: Nice throw.

00:39:07.350 --> 00:39:08.642
AUDIENCE: So thanks for coming.

00:39:08.642 --> 00:39:10.500
It was a super interesting talk.

00:39:10.500 --> 00:39:13.717
So feel free to tell
me to just go away.

00:39:13.717 --> 00:39:14.800
HELDER GUIMARAES: Go away.

00:39:14.800 --> 00:39:18.000
AUDIENCE: Well, OK.

00:39:18.000 --> 00:39:19.476
HELDER GUIMARAES:
I'm not joking.

00:39:19.476 --> 00:39:20.450
[LAUGHTER]

00:39:20.450 --> 00:39:20.950
[INAUDIBLE]

00:39:20.950 --> 00:39:21.550
I'm kidding.

00:39:21.550 --> 00:39:22.050
I'm kidding.

00:39:22.050 --> 00:39:24.355
Of course I'm kidding.

00:39:24.355 --> 00:39:25.230
No, you can sit down.

00:39:25.230 --> 00:39:25.730
Sit down.

00:39:25.730 --> 00:39:26.672
That's ridiculous.

00:39:26.672 --> 00:39:27.630
That's just ridiculous.

00:39:27.630 --> 00:39:29.760
That's just ridiculous.

00:39:29.760 --> 00:39:34.050
AUDIENCE: How do you figure out
just the technical mechanics

00:39:34.050 --> 00:39:37.110
of a new trick that
you're developing?

00:39:37.110 --> 00:39:38.820
I've obviously never
been in this space,

00:39:38.820 --> 00:39:40.710
so I don't understand,
like I want

00:39:40.710 --> 00:39:45.360
to be able to pull the
correct card out of a deck,

00:39:45.360 --> 00:39:48.550
or I want to do this or
that, or this other thing.

00:39:48.550 --> 00:39:53.250
So what's the general process
of one, deciding what exactly

00:39:53.250 --> 00:39:55.710
do you want to do
onstage, and then two,

00:39:55.710 --> 00:39:58.753
how are you going to
go about executing it?

00:39:58.753 --> 00:40:00.670
HELDER GUIMARAES: It's
a really good question.

00:40:00.670 --> 00:40:03.510
I don't know if I
have an answer per se,

00:40:03.510 --> 00:40:05.190
but I'll try to do my best.

00:40:05.190 --> 00:40:09.840
So most of the things
I decide to do onstage

00:40:09.840 --> 00:40:13.530
come out from stories,
come out from something

00:40:13.530 --> 00:40:18.900
that appeals to me on
the story side of it,

00:40:18.900 --> 00:40:23.670
or in the moment I want to
create with the audience.

00:40:23.670 --> 00:40:28.000
So that's the reason why
I decide to do something.

00:40:28.000 --> 00:40:29.880
How do I end up creating those?

00:40:29.880 --> 00:40:32.850
So there is a lot of--

00:40:32.850 --> 00:40:37.800
magic has a very rich
history of people

00:40:37.800 --> 00:40:41.250
that created and decided
to share with other people

00:40:41.250 --> 00:40:42.070
their creation.

00:40:42.070 --> 00:40:46.758
So you are always studying, and
you are always learning things,

00:40:46.758 --> 00:40:49.050
that eventually one day you
can go like, you know what?

00:40:49.050 --> 00:40:51.630
I can apply that concept.

00:40:51.630 --> 00:40:54.490
So there are a bunch
of concepts that I

00:40:54.490 --> 00:40:58.290
would say that they are
finite, in terms of they

00:40:58.290 --> 00:41:00.130
are limited to a certain amount.

00:41:00.130 --> 00:41:03.700
But then the application of
those concepts, it's infinite.

00:41:03.700 --> 00:41:08.430
It just goes with your
imagination and your ability

00:41:08.430 --> 00:41:12.640
to actually implement those
concepts in different ways.

00:41:12.640 --> 00:41:16.060
So when I have a problem--

00:41:16.060 --> 00:41:19.920
and I really like to start
with problems that I go,

00:41:19.920 --> 00:41:23.200
I have no idea
how I can do this.

00:41:23.200 --> 00:41:27.420
So now, it's almost like,
this is the illusion.

00:41:27.420 --> 00:41:29.760
Because I know that
what I'm trying to do,

00:41:29.760 --> 00:41:31.500
it's actually impossible.

00:41:31.500 --> 00:41:34.920
So now it's, how can I
create this illusion?

00:41:34.920 --> 00:41:38.550
And now I kind of start
going back, step by step.

00:41:38.550 --> 00:41:42.180
If I want to reach this
moment, what would I

00:41:42.180 --> 00:41:45.060
have to do right before this?

00:41:45.060 --> 00:41:47.250
Maybe this, maybe
this, maybe this.

00:41:47.250 --> 00:41:50.910
And then you end up
with, I would say, maybe

00:41:50.910 --> 00:41:55.410
sometimes seven, eight,
sometimes more, sometimes less,

00:41:55.410 --> 00:41:57.480
basically solutions.

00:41:57.480 --> 00:41:59.620
And then you actually
start trying them.

00:41:59.620 --> 00:42:01.685
And you go like,
OK, let me try this.

00:42:01.685 --> 00:42:03.600
No, there is something
missing here.

00:42:03.600 --> 00:42:06.657
Or actually it's
not that deceptive.

00:42:06.657 --> 00:42:08.490
Because then you have
to make that judgment.

00:42:08.490 --> 00:42:10.590
It's like, is the
audience going to be

00:42:10.590 --> 00:42:13.750
deceived with this idea or not?

00:42:13.750 --> 00:42:17.460
So it's all those
things combine.

00:42:17.460 --> 00:42:20.130
And on the side, you always
have the story going like,

00:42:20.130 --> 00:42:22.710
that really does
not match the story.

00:42:22.710 --> 00:42:25.860
So this method is
completely discarded,

00:42:25.860 --> 00:42:30.570
because it's not faithful to
the story I want to convey.

00:42:30.570 --> 00:42:31.480
This one is closer.

00:42:31.480 --> 00:42:31.980
OK.

00:42:31.980 --> 00:42:34.530
So now this one is
something I can work on,

00:42:34.530 --> 00:42:41.030
and I can develop on top of
that basic idea or first idea.

00:42:41.030 --> 00:42:44.760
And then eventually, you come
up with moments and pieces

00:42:44.760 --> 00:42:49.600
that you're proud of,
or that you think work.

00:42:49.600 --> 00:42:52.150
But at the end of the
day, you have to do it.

00:42:52.150 --> 00:42:56.880
And if the audience
says no, you go, OK.

00:42:56.880 --> 00:42:58.840
You just go home.

00:42:58.840 --> 00:43:00.630
Then you really go home.

00:43:00.630 --> 00:43:02.810
Then you really go home.

00:43:02.810 --> 00:43:07.800
But it's those things
combine that is

00:43:07.800 --> 00:43:11.700
kind of the process to get
on stage and do something.

00:43:16.510 --> 00:43:19.960
AUDIENCE: So you tell
stories and send messages

00:43:19.960 --> 00:43:22.610
in lots of different,
I'll say, audiences,

00:43:22.610 --> 00:43:25.120
like there's 50
people here or so.

00:43:25.120 --> 00:43:27.270
You do shows where
it's 25 people.

00:43:27.270 --> 00:43:31.190
The Geffen's 120 or something.

00:43:31.190 --> 00:43:33.700
A TED Talk is a lot more,
and then social media's

00:43:33.700 --> 00:43:35.380
however many.

00:43:35.380 --> 00:43:39.360
How do those different spaces--

00:43:39.360 --> 00:43:42.610
how do you decide what
story you want to tell,

00:43:42.610 --> 00:43:44.550
or how you pick the words?

00:43:44.550 --> 00:43:47.170
How do you decide how
to convey the message

00:43:47.170 --> 00:43:48.520
in these different environments?

00:43:48.520 --> 00:43:50.560
And how does that
change, particularly

00:43:50.560 --> 00:43:54.130
when you're speaking
to a larger audience?

00:43:54.130 --> 00:43:58.570
HELDER GUIMARAES: It
does because you always

00:43:58.570 --> 00:44:04.090
have to adapt the show you do
to the room you're playing in.

00:44:04.090 --> 00:44:13.820
And of course, the more
you learn how to do it,

00:44:13.820 --> 00:44:17.290
the more easy it is to
create moments of intimacy

00:44:17.290 --> 00:44:19.230
in larger spaces.

00:44:19.230 --> 00:44:21.310
In that sense, I've--

00:44:21.310 --> 00:44:26.950
so the last show I've done in
Portugal was for 900 people.

00:44:26.950 --> 00:44:34.780
And at that point, it's not
an intimate show no longer.

00:44:34.780 --> 00:44:37.720
But it doesn't mean it can't
be an intimate experience

00:44:37.720 --> 00:44:38.920
for people.

00:44:38.920 --> 00:44:42.310
You just have to
do certain choices

00:44:42.310 --> 00:44:47.590
in terms of scenic design
and in terms of text

00:44:47.590 --> 00:44:50.020
and in terms of-- for
example, in that show

00:44:50.020 --> 00:44:53.020
there is a camera that
projects the top of the table,

00:44:53.020 --> 00:44:55.030
and there's a big screen.

00:44:55.030 --> 00:44:56.485
But you can't overuse it.

00:44:56.485 --> 00:44:58.360
Because all of the
sudden, if you overuse it,

00:44:58.360 --> 00:45:01.660
people feel that they are always
seeing things on the screen.

00:45:01.660 --> 00:45:02.950
And don't feel that.

00:45:02.950 --> 00:45:07.690
So you have to decide
and craft the show more

00:45:07.690 --> 00:45:12.130
around the technical challenges
that you're going to have.

00:45:12.130 --> 00:45:14.530
And I think the
bigger the space is,

00:45:14.530 --> 00:45:20.380
the more you have
to do it that way.

00:45:20.380 --> 00:45:22.510
In a smaller space,
where everyone

00:45:22.510 --> 00:45:25.780
can observe you and
be closer to you,

00:45:25.780 --> 00:45:30.770
then it's the story that
really drives more the creation

00:45:30.770 --> 00:45:32.180
of everything.

00:45:32.180 --> 00:45:34.390
That's why I prefer that.

00:45:34.390 --> 00:45:38.020
It's because then I can really
focus on what I want to say

00:45:38.020 --> 00:45:40.650
and how I want to
tell the story.

00:45:40.650 --> 00:45:43.120
How I go about
selecting the stories,

00:45:43.120 --> 00:45:46.870
it comes from life
experiences and moments

00:45:46.870 --> 00:45:50.080
I am living and doubts I have.

00:45:50.080 --> 00:45:56.680
It's not that rare
that I find myself

00:45:56.680 --> 00:45:59.020
doing a show to try
to answer to something

00:45:59.020 --> 00:46:01.090
I don't have an answer.

00:46:01.090 --> 00:46:02.860
Like now.

00:46:02.860 --> 00:46:06.310
This show I'm doing,
it's about how

00:46:06.310 --> 00:46:11.200
we deal with mystery in a
world that has information

00:46:11.200 --> 00:46:13.600
at the fingertips, and
that people are not

00:46:13.600 --> 00:46:18.260
willing to not know something.

00:46:18.260 --> 00:46:20.290
How many conversations
do you have

00:46:20.290 --> 00:46:23.470
per month where all of a
sudden you have a doubt,

00:46:23.470 --> 00:46:29.800
and immediately you take the
phone to answer that doubt?

00:46:29.800 --> 00:46:34.390
That's a mechanism that in
certain cases makes sense.

00:46:34.390 --> 00:46:37.690
In others, you
should not do that.

00:46:37.690 --> 00:46:43.120
You should pull a little bit
from behind of your brain

00:46:43.120 --> 00:46:46.210
and try to deal with
that in a different way.

00:46:46.210 --> 00:46:49.030
Because it can be very useful--

00:46:49.030 --> 00:46:52.410
and actually, saying this
at Google just feels weird.

00:46:52.410 --> 00:46:54.760
[LAUGHTER]

00:46:54.760 --> 00:46:58.360
But one thing is
the ability of being

00:46:58.360 --> 00:47:00.860
able to have that information.

00:47:00.860 --> 00:47:02.380
I think that's great.

00:47:02.380 --> 00:47:05.630
How we value that information
and how we use it,

00:47:05.630 --> 00:47:07.510
and how we leave
space for mystery--

00:47:07.510 --> 00:47:13.210
because mystery can be so much
important in our life as well--

00:47:13.210 --> 00:47:17.860
that balance, it's something
that I personally am always

00:47:17.860 --> 00:47:19.240
struggling to understand.

00:47:19.240 --> 00:47:22.660
And I believe other
people probably too.

00:47:22.660 --> 00:47:27.170
So the show deals a
little bit with that.

00:47:27.170 --> 00:47:29.770
And it's just a story
in the perspective

00:47:29.770 --> 00:47:34.930
from my side of the table
of maybe how we can all

00:47:34.930 --> 00:47:37.340
incorporate a little bit
more mystery in our lives.

00:47:42.600 --> 00:47:46.680
AUDIENCE: So I will
say having gotten

00:47:46.680 --> 00:47:49.082
to have the experience of
sitting with you in table

00:47:49.082 --> 00:47:51.290
and being a participant is
something that will always

00:47:51.290 --> 00:47:53.833
stick with me.

00:47:53.833 --> 00:47:55.000
HELDER GUIMARAES: Thank you.

00:47:55.000 --> 00:47:57.470
AUDIENCE: And one of
the things I realized

00:47:57.470 --> 00:47:59.930
that helped contribute
to that sense of wonder

00:47:59.930 --> 00:48:04.310
is the fact that your
style of performance

00:48:04.310 --> 00:48:08.847
was something that I had no
idea what was going to happen.

00:48:08.847 --> 00:48:10.430
But there are, of
course, other people

00:48:10.430 --> 00:48:14.342
who in their performances
set up an expectation where,

00:48:14.342 --> 00:48:16.550
for example, if it's a
prediction or something, where

00:48:16.550 --> 00:48:19.480
you sort of know what
the end goal is, right?

00:48:19.480 --> 00:48:21.720
Where you know what
they're going to do,

00:48:21.720 --> 00:48:26.300
and the question is, the
setup is that it's impossible,

00:48:26.300 --> 00:48:28.560
but they're somehow
still going to do it.

00:48:28.560 --> 00:48:31.730
What do you think draws you
towards the other style, where

00:48:31.730 --> 00:48:34.922
there isn't a clear
expectation, where someone

00:48:34.922 --> 00:48:36.380
has no idea what's
going to happen,

00:48:36.380 --> 00:48:40.700
that you haven't necessarily
set up that oh, this

00:48:40.700 --> 00:48:42.560
is the thing I'm going
towards, and instead

00:48:42.560 --> 00:48:45.560
you just surprise them?

00:48:45.560 --> 00:48:50.250
HELDER GUIMARAES: I actually
use both when I'm doing a show.

00:48:50.250 --> 00:48:54.260
I use moments like
you're saying,

00:48:54.260 --> 00:49:00.230
like setting up an expectation
and trying to deliver that.

00:49:00.230 --> 00:49:02.990
I just like the fact
that the audience

00:49:02.990 --> 00:49:09.330
is less worried about the
end and more interested

00:49:09.330 --> 00:49:10.280
in the journey.

00:49:10.280 --> 00:49:14.390
So that's why I prefer a little
bit the surprise style, as you

00:49:14.390 --> 00:49:19.370
said, has to do with that, the
idea of, where is this going?

00:49:19.370 --> 00:49:21.590
Let's live this story together.

00:49:21.590 --> 00:49:25.160
It's more on that side
that my preference takes.

00:49:25.160 --> 00:49:29.960
But in a one hour show, you
have to kind of play with that.

00:49:29.960 --> 00:49:36.590
There is actually an
article in the magic world

00:49:36.590 --> 00:49:40.070
that talks about
surprise versus suspense,

00:49:40.070 --> 00:49:46.700
and how that affects one, the
creation, other, the audience

00:49:46.700 --> 00:49:49.290
experience of the show.

00:49:49.290 --> 00:49:52.170
And I think both are valuable.

00:49:52.170 --> 00:49:55.700
And I think both play
a part on my work.

00:49:55.700 --> 00:49:59.870
I really like the
fact that I'm sharing

00:49:59.870 --> 00:50:03.900
the journey with the
audience at the same time,

00:50:03.900 --> 00:50:06.450
instead of telling
you, by the way,

00:50:06.450 --> 00:50:09.480
I already know where
this is going to end.

00:50:09.480 --> 00:50:12.830
And so now you're just
watching, but you know

00:50:12.830 --> 00:50:14.340
where this is going to end.

00:50:14.340 --> 00:50:18.560
I like that part to also be
kind of unclear and unknown,

00:50:18.560 --> 00:50:23.540
so that when it happens,
you go, wait a minute.

00:50:23.540 --> 00:50:26.005
I love that type of--

00:50:26.005 --> 00:50:28.380
it's a game almost with the
audience that you're playing.

00:50:28.380 --> 00:50:31.250
And I like that game
of the audience almost

00:50:31.250 --> 00:50:34.250
being a detective
during the process,

00:50:34.250 --> 00:50:36.830
being like, why
is he doing this?

00:50:36.830 --> 00:50:37.720
Why?

00:50:37.720 --> 00:50:39.010
Oh.

00:50:39.010 --> 00:50:41.250
I like that moment.

00:50:41.250 --> 00:50:44.450
But to be honest, it's
just because of that.

00:50:44.450 --> 00:50:48.860
I like the audience to
be in this boat with me

00:50:48.860 --> 00:50:49.700
in terms of journey.

00:50:53.548 --> 00:50:54.090
AUDIENCE: Hi.

00:50:54.090 --> 00:50:55.640
HELDER GUIMARAES: Hi.

00:50:55.640 --> 00:50:59.950
AUDIENCE: So when you are
watching other performers,

00:50:59.950 --> 00:51:02.920
is it easy for you to
deconstruct their tricks

00:51:02.920 --> 00:51:05.770
and illusions, or
are you also amazed?

00:51:05.770 --> 00:51:09.370
And are there any illusions that
have stumped you to this day

00:51:09.370 --> 00:51:13.670
that you still can't
tell how they did it?

00:51:13.670 --> 00:51:21.300
HELDER GUIMARAES: It's hard to
let go the magician side of it.

00:51:21.300 --> 00:51:22.190
I admit it.

00:51:22.190 --> 00:51:24.360
So when I'm seeing
a performance,

00:51:24.360 --> 00:51:29.000
it's almost like I'm
seeing with a double brain.

00:51:29.000 --> 00:51:33.043
I'm trying to enjoy it
without thinking too much.

00:51:33.043 --> 00:51:34.460
But then there are
certain moments

00:51:34.460 --> 00:51:37.340
that definitely
click, just because I

00:51:37.340 --> 00:51:39.027
know how things are done.

00:51:39.027 --> 00:51:40.610
So all of the sudden,
it's really hard

00:51:40.610 --> 00:51:43.550
just to let it go completely.

00:51:43.550 --> 00:51:45.620
That said, that
doesn't mean that I

00:51:45.620 --> 00:51:49.350
don't appreciate a performance
when it's well done.

00:51:49.350 --> 00:51:55.160
In fact, I always say this
as a comparison situation.

00:51:55.160 --> 00:51:58.370
If you play the piano,
and you go to a concert,

00:51:58.370 --> 00:52:02.540
and someone is playing a
recital or something like that,

00:52:02.540 --> 00:52:08.210
and they are playing, and
you know how to play piano,

00:52:08.210 --> 00:52:10.520
you are listening to the
melody, but you are also

00:52:10.520 --> 00:52:13.370
listening to their
choices and how

00:52:13.370 --> 00:52:16.910
they decide to do certain
parts quicker or with more

00:52:16.910 --> 00:52:19.850
strength or all that.

00:52:19.850 --> 00:52:22.520
And so when I'm seeing a
magic performance normally,

00:52:22.520 --> 00:52:25.460
I'm also seeing those
choices and seeing

00:52:25.460 --> 00:52:28.910
where those choices will
make the audience arrive

00:52:28.910 --> 00:52:31.100
in terms of impossibility.

00:52:31.100 --> 00:52:33.540
And so I really appreciate--

00:52:33.540 --> 00:52:38.450
and sometimes it's even
more beautiful to be

00:52:38.450 --> 00:52:43.700
able to see the audience
reaction and also that.

00:52:43.700 --> 00:52:46.910
But there have been
a couple of times--

00:52:46.910 --> 00:52:50.480
I can't say that it's
the common thing--

00:52:50.480 --> 00:52:53.040
but where all of the
sudden, I'm in a moment,

00:52:53.040 --> 00:52:55.540
and I don't understand
how something happens,

00:52:55.540 --> 00:52:56.990
and I just love it.

00:52:56.990 --> 00:52:59.670
Because I don't have that
reaction that many times.

00:52:59.670 --> 00:53:01.310
So when I have it,
I really cherish.

00:53:01.310 --> 00:53:04.220
And I really-- the
only reason for me

00:53:04.220 --> 00:53:08.360
after to try to find
an answer to that

00:53:08.360 --> 00:53:11.840
is if I find any
valuable on that

00:53:11.840 --> 00:53:13.820
to be able to use on my work.

00:53:13.820 --> 00:53:17.900
But there have been, I would say
that two or three cases, where

00:53:17.900 --> 00:53:21.800
I've seen something that
I go, what I'm seeing

00:53:21.800 --> 00:53:24.900
has no relation to
my type of work.

00:53:24.900 --> 00:53:26.730
So I just prefer not to know.

00:53:26.730 --> 00:53:28.940
And I really don't.

00:53:28.940 --> 00:53:32.630
Because I don't have that
many moments like that.

00:53:32.630 --> 00:53:34.220
So I really cherish those.

00:53:34.220 --> 00:53:38.750
So I really don't want to know,
unless it can move something

00:53:38.750 --> 00:53:40.950
forward on my work.

00:53:40.950 --> 00:53:44.510
And then I probably will
search for an answer.

00:53:44.510 --> 00:53:47.550
But there are things
I really don't know.

00:53:47.550 --> 00:53:50.240
I may have a sense,
an idea, but that's

00:53:50.240 --> 00:53:52.790
different than actually knowing.

00:53:52.790 --> 00:53:55.760
That's a very
interesting difference

00:53:55.760 --> 00:53:57.920
between being a magician,
not being a magician,

00:53:57.920 --> 00:53:59.750
and seeing a magic show.

00:53:59.750 --> 00:54:05.690
If you see a magic show,
and you kind of find out 10%

00:54:05.690 --> 00:54:08.660
of what you're seeing--

00:54:08.660 --> 00:54:11.720
let's suppose what
you call the trick.

00:54:11.720 --> 00:54:14.090
I really hate the word trick.

00:54:14.090 --> 00:54:16.820
Dogs do tricks for me.

00:54:16.820 --> 00:54:21.170
But like I call them
pieces or repertoire,

00:54:21.170 --> 00:54:22.020
something like that.

00:54:22.020 --> 00:54:25.778
But imagine you're seeing a
magic piece, and you find 10%.

00:54:25.778 --> 00:54:27.320
If you are an audience
member and you

00:54:27.320 --> 00:54:30.890
know nothing about magic, you go
like oh, I know how he did it.

00:54:30.890 --> 00:54:33.690
And you just know 10%.

00:54:33.690 --> 00:54:37.520
If I am a magician, and
I'm seeing the same thing,

00:54:37.520 --> 00:54:41.990
and I know 90%, I go
like, yeah, I really

00:54:41.990 --> 00:54:43.130
don't know how he did it.

00:54:43.130 --> 00:54:49.140
Because I am aware that I'm
missing those extra 10%.

00:54:49.140 --> 00:54:52.160
So it's a very interesting
thing how we relate

00:54:52.160 --> 00:54:54.380
to knowing or not knowing.

00:54:54.380 --> 00:54:58.430
If we know a lot, we also
know what we don't know.

00:54:58.430 --> 00:55:01.340
If we know very little,
we think we know

00:55:01.340 --> 00:55:03.150
more than we actually know.

00:55:03.150 --> 00:55:03.650
It's true.

00:55:03.650 --> 00:55:05.810
It's true in any case.

00:55:05.810 --> 00:55:08.660
And with magic, you
can say that to a test.

00:55:08.660 --> 00:55:11.000
I've been in so many
interesting conversations

00:55:11.000 --> 00:55:13.220
after shows of mine
with friends that

00:55:13.220 --> 00:55:15.380
go like, I really
liked your show,

00:55:15.380 --> 00:55:18.510
but I figured this one out.

00:55:18.510 --> 00:55:20.990
And I just go like, oh really?

00:55:20.990 --> 00:55:24.300
And so I go down the road
with them and go like,

00:55:24.300 --> 00:55:26.210
so tell me how I do it.

00:55:26.210 --> 00:55:28.980
And they start
going step by step.

00:55:28.980 --> 00:55:32.990
And I know there is a hole in
the middle of the conversation

00:55:32.990 --> 00:55:38.010
where they're just going to go
like, oh, I really don't know.

00:55:38.010 --> 00:55:39.620
But I led them to that hole.

00:55:39.620 --> 00:55:41.120
Very like, oh really?

00:55:41.120 --> 00:55:44.150
[INAUDIBLE]

00:55:44.150 --> 00:55:48.980
And this-- oh, oh yeah,
I really don't know.

00:55:48.980 --> 00:55:50.750
OK, so shut up next time.

00:55:50.750 --> 00:55:53.262
Just shut up.

00:55:53.262 --> 00:55:54.337
And that's OK.

00:55:54.337 --> 00:55:55.670
To be honest with you, I'm not--

00:55:55.670 --> 00:55:59.360
if people find
out, they find out.

00:55:59.360 --> 00:56:03.360
I always say this as
a joke, but it's true.

00:56:03.360 --> 00:56:05.510
I'm very privileged
of doing what I do,

00:56:05.510 --> 00:56:08.720
because I bring joy to
people, and I make them happy,

00:56:08.720 --> 00:56:11.450
and it's entertaining.

00:56:11.450 --> 00:56:13.730
What I do falls
in the bright side

00:56:13.730 --> 00:56:17.780
of life, which for me I'm very
fortunate to be part of it.

00:56:17.780 --> 00:56:21.050
This is not like you're
curing a life death

00:56:21.050 --> 00:56:23.310
situation on a patient.

00:56:23.310 --> 00:56:27.920
And if you fail, that is tough.

00:56:27.920 --> 00:56:31.010
If I fail something
or if you find out,

00:56:31.010 --> 00:56:34.630
life goes exactly in
the same direction.

00:56:34.630 --> 00:56:38.900
So I'm not that uncomfortable
if people find out.

00:56:38.900 --> 00:56:41.030
I always try my
best to make sure

00:56:41.030 --> 00:56:43.160
that they have the
mystery for their life.

00:56:43.160 --> 00:56:45.170
That's my goal.

00:56:45.170 --> 00:56:48.860
But it's so funny to lead
people into these conversations,

00:56:48.860 --> 00:56:52.230
and having them realize that
they actually don't know.

00:56:52.230 --> 00:56:54.857
It's just really funny for me.

00:56:54.857 --> 00:56:55.690
AUDIENCE: Thank you.

00:56:55.690 --> 00:56:56.180
SPEAKER: Thank you.

00:56:56.180 --> 00:56:57.888
We have time for maybe
one more question.

00:57:00.387 --> 00:57:01.970
AUDIENCE: Can you
tell us a little bit

00:57:01.970 --> 00:57:03.400
about how you practice?

00:57:03.400 --> 00:57:05.930
And I'm sure at
your stage, you've

00:57:05.930 --> 00:57:07.130
mastered the double lift.

00:57:07.130 --> 00:57:09.260
But are you still doing
it 100 times a day,

00:57:09.260 --> 00:57:11.360
or what does your practice
routine look like?

00:57:11.360 --> 00:57:14.180
HELDER GUIMARAES: No, I
don't do it 100 times a day,

00:57:14.180 --> 00:57:16.640
because it's boring.

00:57:16.640 --> 00:57:22.310
But you definitely practice the
same way that you would say--

00:57:24.920 --> 00:57:29.510
there is a difference between
getting the skill to the level

00:57:29.510 --> 00:57:31.190
you want to get it,
and then keeping

00:57:31.190 --> 00:57:32.610
the skill at that level.

00:57:32.610 --> 00:57:36.290
So to keep the skill, you don't
have to technically practice

00:57:36.290 --> 00:57:37.340
that much.

00:57:37.340 --> 00:57:39.800
But you still have to
do it on a regular basis

00:57:39.800 --> 00:57:41.640
and consistent basis.

00:57:41.640 --> 00:57:45.170
But I'm always trying to
improve certain things

00:57:45.170 --> 00:57:48.980
or invent new skills
or invent new things.

00:57:48.980 --> 00:57:52.400
So I'm always focused
more on that side

00:57:52.400 --> 00:57:56.990
than necessarily keeping
the skill level where I am.

00:57:56.990 --> 00:58:00.860
Because doing that
ends up protecting

00:58:00.860 --> 00:58:03.260
what I've accomplished before.

00:58:03.260 --> 00:58:04.800
But you have to do it every day.

00:58:04.800 --> 00:58:10.310
So every day I have a few hours
that I just spend on a table,

00:58:10.310 --> 00:58:13.130
what we say shuffling
cards, which is actually not

00:58:13.130 --> 00:58:14.840
shuffling cards.

00:58:14.840 --> 00:58:19.160
But just doing a
bunch of things.

00:58:19.160 --> 00:58:21.560
And finding things.

00:58:21.560 --> 00:58:25.370
I'm always finding new
interesting details that can

00:58:25.370 --> 00:58:29.010
take things to the next step.

00:58:29.010 --> 00:58:30.500
But you do that.

00:58:30.500 --> 00:58:32.210
You do that in
front of a mirror.

00:58:32.210 --> 00:58:35.450
You do that to close friends
when you want to do something.

00:58:35.450 --> 00:58:39.380
Normally I'm at dinner with
friends, and if I want to--

00:58:39.380 --> 00:58:42.500
I normally don't like to
just do things per se,

00:58:42.500 --> 00:58:44.330
but if I want to
practice something,

00:58:44.330 --> 00:58:46.370
all of the sudden, all I have
to do is take the deck of cards

00:58:46.370 --> 00:58:48.412
and put it on the table,
because someone is going

00:58:48.412 --> 00:58:50.220
to ask me to do something.

00:58:50.220 --> 00:58:52.820
And then I go, OK, that's a
good chance to practice that,

00:58:52.820 --> 00:58:55.250
because it's a safe environment.

00:58:55.250 --> 00:59:01.070
So you find those moments
to do things like that,

00:59:01.070 --> 00:59:03.750
and to find the
audience reactions.

00:59:03.750 --> 00:59:05.390
So that then you can
incorporate those

00:59:05.390 --> 00:59:08.990
in longer pieces and
moments like a show,

00:59:08.990 --> 00:59:10.660
like I'm doing now.

00:59:10.660 --> 00:59:16.530
But yes, definitely, you have
to keep practicing every day.

Unless you want to quit.

00:59:17.790 --> 00:59:21.868
And then it would be
fine not do anything.

00:59:21.868 --> 00:59:23.910
SPEAKER: OK, I think that's
all the time we have.

00:59:23.910 --> 00:59:25.465
Thank you, Helder,
so much for coming

00:59:25.465 --> 00:59:26.480
to spend some time with us.

00:59:26.480 --> 00:59:28.647
HELDER GUIMARAES: Thank you
very much for having me.

00:59:28.647 --> 00:59:31.690
