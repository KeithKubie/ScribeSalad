00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.980
In Los Angeles parking is notoriously awful signs are beyond confusing

00:00:05.440 --> 00:00:10.410
Tickets are expensive and meter maids are prompt as all hell, so, of course one day I'm running late to an audition

00:00:10.410 --> 00:00:14.820
So I just park on a street without solving the riddle of the sign and I just run inside

00:00:14.950 --> 00:00:16.230
When I got back to my car

00:00:16.230 --> 00:00:21.539
There was this like old man and the process of writing me a ticket and just out of pure habit when he handed it to

00:00:21.539 --> 00:00:24.179
Me I said thank you and he immediately

00:00:24.760 --> 00:00:26.080
broke down crying

00:00:26.280 --> 00:00:29.740
Man: *Sobs* Noone's ever thanked me before

00:00:30.160 --> 00:00:30.840
Anna: Oh

00:00:30.840 --> 00:00:33.420
Man: People are always so angry to see me you know?

00:00:33.860 --> 00:00:36.940
I've been cursed at, had stuff thrown at me

00:00:37.140 --> 00:00:40.440
One guy tried to punch me. I'm just doing my job, you know,?

00:00:40.440 --> 00:00:45.080
Anna: Oh I'm sorry, but it's ok. I mean honestly, it's  my fault for not reading the signs.

00:00:45.260 --> 00:00:51.660
Man: EXACTLY! It's not like I wanna give everyone tickets. It's so hard having a job where everyone hates you

00:00:51.660 --> 00:00:55.220
*Man continues to cry while the valiant Anna consoles him*

00:00:55.300 --> 00:00:56.820
But it did get me thinking because

00:00:56.829 --> 00:01:01.858
yeah everyone in Los Angeles and I'm sure other big cities hate returning their car and seeing a meter maid and

00:01:01.960 --> 00:01:04.830
Knowing that a ticket is upwards of like 50 bucks here

00:01:04.830 --> 00:01:08.999
I'm sure people start freaking out because they're financially strapped or upset at themselves

00:01:09.100 --> 00:01:15.659
And I started to wonder about all the other people who work jobs that we have a negative association with like people at the DMV

00:01:15.760 --> 00:01:19.220
Or tax auditors. How does that make you feel?

00:01:20.440 --> 00:01:22.440
Flash from Zootopia: Sad

00:01:24.120 --> 00:01:28.580
It's not my fault that the DMV is so slow

00:01:28.740 --> 00:01:31.610
Forreal tho I love that sloth scene from Zootopia. So I had to work it in

00:01:31.610 --> 00:01:32.120
but anyway

00:01:32.120 --> 00:01:37.400
I found that I have more compassion for people doing tough work and that I should really start taking more responsibility

00:01:37.460 --> 00:01:40.800
For myself and my choices like it's not a meter maids fault

00:01:40.820 --> 00:01:43.400
If I don't read the signs or fill out my parking meter on time

00:01:43.400 --> 00:01:48.800
And it's not a tax auditors fault if anyone chooses to lie on their taxes or be really lazy and filling them out

00:01:48.800 --> 00:01:54.820
So I encourage you when you encounter someone who can't get your order right or who pulls you over or who's just an animated sloths?

00:01:54.820 --> 00:01:56.820
Have empathy practice

00:01:56.900 --> 00:02:02.320
accountability if it is your fault and know that we're all just doing the best that we can. Now whenever I feel

00:02:02.400 --> 00:02:03.619
frustrated with bad service

00:02:03.619 --> 00:02:06.859
I try to imagine that like older gentleman crying and think

00:02:07.020 --> 00:02:07.640
You know what?

00:02:07.640 --> 00:02:10.309
Maybe this waiter just had a fight with his father and maybe that

00:02:10.470 --> 00:02:14.839
Salesperson was just left by their wife and now is trying to figure out how to support their kids on one salary

00:02:14.840 --> 00:02:17.899
I remember when I worked at Gamestop in my teens

00:02:18.480 --> 00:02:22.850
one time I went to the back room to cry because my sister had died only a few months earlier and

00:02:22.940 --> 00:02:27.500
I returned to work 'cuz I really wanted the distraction. But I mean it was tough and

00:02:27.860 --> 00:02:32.880
my coworker came into the back room to kind of comfort me and this lady just barged in and

00:02:32.920 --> 00:02:38.680
Screamed at us for being horrible customer service reps and that she'd been waiting to check out for like five minutes

00:02:38.850 --> 00:02:40.670
And I was like, hey ma'am, I'm so sorry

00:02:40.670 --> 00:02:46.860
I recently lost a family member and instead she was just like you're a liar and you're probably having sex with your co-worker in the backroom

00:02:46.980 --> 00:02:49.010
And I'll never forget how I felt in that moment

00:02:49.010 --> 00:02:55.729
I was so dumb struck that anyone could be that callous over waiting five freaking minutes to buy a video game like

00:02:56.040 --> 00:02:57.410
Come on lady. We're all gonna die

00:02:57.410 --> 00:03:00.919
I mean, do you really need to have that kind of attitude before we do so yeah

00:03:00.920 --> 00:03:05.149
I guess another lesson of this video would be that everyone needs to work food service or

00:03:05.400 --> 00:03:08.959
Retail to figure out how to be a better human being I'm Anna Akana

00:03:09.269 --> 00:03:13.399
