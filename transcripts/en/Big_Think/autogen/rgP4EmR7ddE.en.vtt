only seeing the cracks but with a little
dose of hope and choosing to be

00:04:32.670 --> 00:04:32.680
dose of hope and choosing to be
 

00:04:32.680 --> 00:04:38.550
dose of hope and choosing to be
optimistic we can turn any crack into

00:04:38.550 --> 00:04:38.560
optimistic we can turn any crack into
 

00:04:38.560 --> 00:04:42.450
optimistic we can turn any crack into
petals and to shift the way that we

00:04:42.450 --> 00:04:42.460
petals and to shift the way that we
 

00:04:42.460 --> 00:04:46.200
petals and to shift the way that we
think about brokenness into perfection

00:04:46.200 --> 00:04:46.210
think about brokenness into perfection
 

00:04:46.210 --> 00:04:50.249
think about brokenness into perfection
and turn our lives into beautiful

00:04:50.249 --> 00:04:50.259
and turn our lives into beautiful
 

00:04:50.259 --> 00:04:54.300
and turn our lives into beautiful
flowers that we get from Judaism and

00:04:54.300 --> 00:04:54.310
flowers that we get from Judaism and
 

00:04:54.310 --> 00:04:56.610
flowers that we get from Judaism and
that we get from wise teachings they

00:04:56.610 --> 00:04:56.620
that we get from wise teachings they
 

00:04:56.620 --> 00:04:58.649
that we get from wise teachings they
come from Jewish past and Jewish lore

00:04:58.649 --> 00:04:58.659
come from Jewish past and Jewish lore
 

00:04:58.659 --> 00:05:02.070

that inspire us to live our lives in the

00:05:02.070 --> 00:05:02.080

best way for ourselves for our families

00:05:04.020 --> 00:05:04.030
best way for ourselves for our families
 

00:05:04.030 --> 00:05:07.700
best way for ourselves for our families
and for others

00:05:07.700 --> 00:05:07.710
and for others
 

00:05:07.710 --> 00:05:10.960
and for others
