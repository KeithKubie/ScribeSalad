00:00:00.797 --> 00:00:02.630
LAURENCE MORONEY: Welcome
to the Googleplex.

00:00:02.630 --> 00:00:05.190
This is an incredible place
with lots of great stuff being

00:00:05.190 --> 00:00:07.970
worked on every single day.

00:00:07.970 --> 00:00:09.950
Before I worked here,
I always wondered

00:00:09.950 --> 00:00:12.360
what it'd be like to
come to the Googleplex,

00:00:12.360 --> 00:00:14.840
meet up with a Googler,
and have coffee with them,

00:00:14.840 --> 00:00:17.390
and just chat about what
they do, how they do it,

00:00:17.390 --> 00:00:18.410
and why they do it.

00:00:18.410 --> 00:00:20.290
And today we're going
to do exactly that.

00:00:23.965 --> 00:00:26.090
Welcome to this episode of
"Coffee With A Googler".

00:00:26.090 --> 00:00:28.030
Today I have a
very special guest.

00:00:28.030 --> 00:00:30.280
You may have seen his face
in the Google Play services

00:00:30.280 --> 00:00:32.340
videos, or you may have
had a t-shirt shot at you

00:00:32.340 --> 00:00:35.250
during Google I/O. And this is
the man responsible-- Magnus

00:00:35.250 --> 00:00:35.750
Hyttsten.

00:00:35.750 --> 00:00:36.820
Welcome to Coffee.

00:00:36.820 --> 00:00:37.670
MAGNUS HYTTSTEN:
Thank you so much.

00:00:37.670 --> 00:00:38.195
LAURENCE MORONEY:
Thanks, so tell

00:00:38.195 --> 00:00:40.490
us a little bit about yourself
and what you do at Google.

00:00:40.490 --> 00:00:42.760
MAGNUS HYTTSTEN: I've been at
Google for over 1 and 1/2 years

00:00:42.760 --> 00:00:43.040
now.

00:00:43.040 --> 00:00:43.915
LAURENCE MORONEY: OK.

00:00:43.915 --> 00:00:47.410
MAGNUS HYTTSTEN: And the
last year and three months,

00:00:47.410 --> 00:00:49.875
I've been working intensively
with Google Play Services.

00:00:49.875 --> 00:00:51.000
LAURENCE MORONEY: OK, cool.

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:52.894
So what is Google Play Services?

00:00:52.894 --> 00:00:54.560
MAGNUS HYTTSTEN: So
Google Play Services

00:00:54.560 --> 00:00:58.295
is a layer of APIs that
sits on top of Android.

00:00:58.295 --> 00:00:59.170
LAURENCE MORONEY: OK.

00:00:59.170 --> 00:01:01.170
MAGNUS HYTTSTEN: And so
for all the applications

00:01:01.170 --> 00:01:03.680
that are distributed to
the Google Play Store,

00:01:03.680 --> 00:01:06.165
this set of APIs are available
for the app developers.

00:01:06.165 --> 00:01:06.990
LAURENCE MORONEY: All right.

00:01:06.990 --> 00:01:09.198
MAGNUS HYTTSTEN: And these
APIs-- they include things

00:01:09.198 --> 00:01:12.140
like location, activity
recognition, maps,

00:01:12.140 --> 00:01:13.340
and many other things.

00:01:13.340 --> 00:01:16.210
There are about 12
APIs in this thing.

00:01:16.210 --> 00:01:18.930
And you can use these,
and they will then

00:01:18.930 --> 00:01:21.010
connect to the back
end data centers

00:01:21.010 --> 00:01:24.936
that Google has to provide
these information services.

00:01:24.936 --> 00:01:26.060
LAURENCE MORONEY: OK, cool.

00:01:26.060 --> 00:01:28.010
Now we had Francis Mann on
the show a few weeks back.

00:01:28.010 --> 00:01:30.051
And one of the things that
Francis shared with us

00:01:30.051 --> 00:01:32.454
was that with the releases
of Google Play Services,

00:01:32.454 --> 00:01:33.620
we named them after cheeses.

00:01:33.620 --> 00:01:34.070
MAGNUS HYTTSTEN: Correct.

00:01:34.070 --> 00:01:35.528
LAURENCE MORONEY:
Right, and I hear

00:01:35.528 --> 00:01:36.900
the latest one is Parmesan?

00:01:36.900 --> 00:01:38.390
MAGNUS HYTTSTEN:
Parmesan, that's correct.

00:01:38.390 --> 00:01:38.720
LAURENCE MORONEY:
Now you've been

00:01:38.720 --> 00:01:40.885
working on some great
release content for Parmesan.

00:01:40.885 --> 00:01:42.370
Can you tell us about that?

00:01:42.370 --> 00:01:44.260
MAGNUS HYTTSTEN: Absolutely.

00:01:44.260 --> 00:01:46.260
So Parmesan-- obviously
being P, we've

00:01:46.260 --> 00:01:48.510
released a lot of these things.

00:01:48.510 --> 00:01:51.290
On average, we probably release
one Google Play Services

00:01:51.290 --> 00:01:54.570
version every two months
or so-- six to eight weeks.

00:01:54.570 --> 00:01:56.470
So there's a lot
of functionality

00:01:56.470 --> 00:01:58.650
that we're able to
pack into this thing,

00:01:58.650 --> 00:02:03.370
and that gets distributed to all
of the users that are connected

00:02:03.370 --> 00:02:04.960
to the Google Play Store.

00:02:04.960 --> 00:02:08.190
So it's this really a massive
user base that gets this.

00:02:08.190 --> 00:02:10.250
Previously, you can
only have one wearable

00:02:10.250 --> 00:02:11.710
connected to your phone.

00:02:11.710 --> 00:02:14.659
So now, you can have any
number of wearables connected.

00:02:14.659 --> 00:02:15.700
LAURENCE MORONEY: Oh wow.

00:02:15.700 --> 00:02:17.070
MAGNUS HYTTSTEN: So you
can actually run around

00:02:17.070 --> 00:02:19.000
with multiple devices
and they're all

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:21.690
interacting in the network
connected to your device.

00:02:21.690 --> 00:02:23.040
LAURENCE MORONEY: Wow, and
you're the hub of this network,

00:02:23.040 --> 00:02:23.670
basically.

00:02:23.670 --> 00:02:24.586
MAGNUS HYTTSTEN: Yeah.

00:02:24.586 --> 00:02:25.832
LAURENCE MORONEY: Haha.

00:02:25.832 --> 00:02:28.290
MAGNUS HYTTSTEN: You can find
a lot of interesting services

00:02:28.290 --> 00:02:31.180
that can build around that.

00:02:31.180 --> 00:02:33.120
And then we have
enhancements to Google Fit.

00:02:33.120 --> 00:02:34.935
Google Fit is quite
a new API, so there

00:02:34.935 --> 00:02:38.050
are continuous enhancements
all the time to Google Fit.

00:02:38.050 --> 00:02:39.580
And we're really
excited about that.

00:02:39.580 --> 00:02:41.560
LAURENCE MORONEY: And with that
nice frequent release update

00:02:41.560 --> 00:02:43.432
cycle, then bugs
get fixed quickly,

00:02:43.432 --> 00:02:44.890
new features get
rolled in quickly.

00:02:44.890 --> 00:02:45.170
MAGNUS HYTTSTEN: Yes.

00:02:45.170 --> 00:02:45.360
LAURENCE MORONEY:
So there's lots

00:02:45.360 --> 00:02:47.070
of good stuff for developers.

00:02:47.070 --> 00:02:49.900
MAGNUS HYTTSTEN: If you're
a developer out developing

00:02:49.900 --> 00:02:53.450
applications, just following the
enhancements and functionality

00:02:53.450 --> 00:02:55.610
that we push into
Google Play Services

00:02:55.610 --> 00:02:58.690
gives you a very
competitive edge

00:02:58.690 --> 00:03:01.510
to building new
things that may have

00:03:01.510 --> 00:03:03.120
been impossible to do before.

00:03:03.120 --> 00:03:03.680
LAURENCE MORONEY:
Now one the things

00:03:03.680 --> 00:03:05.560
that you're notorious
for is how zanily you

00:03:05.560 --> 00:03:07.170
produce this content, right?

00:03:07.170 --> 00:03:09.524
So all the release--
all the release videos

00:03:09.524 --> 00:03:10.690
have Magnus doing his thing.

00:03:10.690 --> 00:03:12.773
We're just going to roll
a quick clip of that now.

00:03:12.773 --> 00:03:15.000
MAGNUS HYTTSTEN: We also
super excited to announce

00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:18.250
that we are releasing
Google Play Services 6.5,

00:03:18.250 --> 00:03:23.130
enabling you to
build better apps!

00:03:23.130 --> 00:03:24.710
And what are we do again?

00:03:24.710 --> 00:03:26.880
COMPUTER VOICE: Recording
"Dev Byte", get to work.

00:03:26.880 --> 00:03:29.050
MAGNUS HYTTSTEN: That's right!

00:03:29.050 --> 00:03:31.800
Fitness, however,
is all about today,

00:03:31.800 --> 00:03:35.750
like how many steps
have you taken today?

00:03:35.750 --> 00:03:39.810
How many calories have you
put in your body today?

00:03:39.810 --> 00:03:43.350
How many pushups
have you done today?

00:03:43.350 --> 00:03:45.480
LAURENCE MORONEY: That's nuts.

00:03:45.480 --> 00:03:46.980
How do you come up
with all of that?

00:03:46.980 --> 00:03:49.290
MAGNUS HYTTSTEN: Well
in the beginning,

00:03:49.290 --> 00:03:52.720
it was just an idea to
keep these things funny

00:03:52.720 --> 00:03:54.200
and engaging.

00:03:54.200 --> 00:03:55.980
And after a while, we
thought, how are we

00:03:55.980 --> 00:03:58.700
going to be able to sustain
this-- come up with new things

00:03:58.700 --> 00:03:59.910
all the time?

00:03:59.910 --> 00:04:03.860
And it kind of solved itself,
because every single release

00:04:03.860 --> 00:04:06.650
has new stuff that
you can talk about.

00:04:06.650 --> 00:04:08.340
You don't need to
invent anything new.

00:04:08.340 --> 00:04:11.080
You can just look the things
that are in the release,

00:04:11.080 --> 00:04:13.900
and then you can find many
fun things to do with them.

00:04:13.900 --> 00:04:15.630
Like activity
recognition-- obviously

00:04:15.630 --> 00:04:19.140
Google Fit is a fantastic
API-- can go out into nature

00:04:19.140 --> 00:04:21.450
and do crazy things, right?

00:04:21.450 --> 00:04:23.740
You can just imagine
now for Parmesan,

00:04:23.740 --> 00:04:28.120
being capable of connecting
multiple wearables

00:04:28.120 --> 00:04:29.790
to a device like this.

00:04:29.790 --> 00:04:32.490
Obviously, it was too
tempting to resist, right?

00:04:32.490 --> 00:04:35.687
So we had to just dress up
all the arms with wearables.

00:04:35.687 --> 00:04:37.270
LAURENCE MORONEY:
That must have hurt.

00:04:37.270 --> 00:04:39.645
MAGNUS HYTTSTEN: Well it took
some time to actually mount

00:04:39.645 --> 00:04:42.640
them on, because these straps--
they're not long enough to go

00:04:42.640 --> 00:04:43.140
around--

00:04:43.140 --> 00:04:44.260
LAURENCE MORONEY: Big
biceps like yours?

00:04:44.260 --> 00:04:46.050
MAGNUS HYTTSTEN: So we
had to use some duct tape

00:04:46.050 --> 00:04:46.800
to get that going.

00:04:46.800 --> 00:04:48.030
LAURENCE MORONEY: Haha.

00:04:48.030 --> 00:04:50.687
That's the dirty
little secret, huh?

00:04:50.687 --> 00:04:52.770
Now with all those kind
of crazy stunts and things

00:04:52.770 --> 00:04:54.720
that you do in video, something
must have gone wrong somewhere.

00:04:54.720 --> 00:04:56.430
MAGNUS HYTTSTEN:
Absolutely, there

00:04:56.430 --> 00:05:00.290
are things that go wrong
beyond just the script.

00:05:00.290 --> 00:05:02.410
Obviously, when we're doing
these physical things,

00:05:02.410 --> 00:05:06.400
with bikes and we're running
around, so we have missteps

00:05:06.400 --> 00:05:09.200
and you hurt your
foot or whatever.

00:05:09.200 --> 00:05:11.249
I remember biking and
falling off the bike,

00:05:11.249 --> 00:05:12.540
because you get really excited.

00:05:12.540 --> 00:05:14.350
You want to get this
thing going right.

00:05:14.350 --> 00:05:19.062
And you make that little extra
effort to make it exciting.

00:05:19.062 --> 00:05:20.520
And in the process
of that, you may

00:05:20.520 --> 00:05:23.030
forget your personal security.

00:05:23.030 --> 00:05:23.650
So--

00:05:23.650 --> 00:05:24.570
LAURENCE MORONEY: Your
personal security.

00:05:24.570 --> 00:05:27.060
MAGNUS HYTTSTEN: So we had some
incidents with respect to that.

00:05:27.060 --> 00:05:28.670
LAURENCE MORONEY: I heard
something about a wet t-shirt

00:05:28.670 --> 00:05:28.840
once.

00:05:28.840 --> 00:05:30.060
MAGNUS HYTTSTEN: Oh yeah.

00:05:30.060 --> 00:05:33.280
In one of the videos, we had
the activity recognition.

00:05:33.280 --> 00:05:37.620
We had this Android voice
speaking to me, saying,

00:05:37.620 --> 00:05:38.500
what am I doing now?

00:05:38.500 --> 00:05:39.780
You are running.

00:05:39.780 --> 00:05:41.130
And things like that.

00:05:41.130 --> 00:05:43.750
At the end of that
scene, I was supposed

00:05:43.750 --> 00:05:45.370
to come up and
look at Googleplex

00:05:45.370 --> 00:05:48.420
and be all wet,
simulating sweat,

00:05:48.420 --> 00:05:49.650
but obviously, we had water.

00:05:49.650 --> 00:05:50.650
LAURENCE MORONEY: Right.

00:05:50.650 --> 00:05:53.460
MAGNUS HYTTSTEN: The problem
is that, that scene did not

00:05:53.460 --> 00:05:56.120
go well and we only
had one t-shirt.

00:05:56.120 --> 00:05:58.370
So we were standing
there with a wet T-shirt

00:05:58.370 --> 00:06:01.510
and we needed to re-record
that scene, right?

00:06:01.510 --> 00:06:02.614
LAURENCE MORONEY: OK.

00:06:02.614 --> 00:06:04.530
MAGNUS HYTTSTEN: So we
just had to be run over

00:06:04.530 --> 00:06:06.540
to the Google store
and buy another T-shirt

00:06:06.540 --> 00:06:07.630
and get on it again.

00:06:07.630 --> 00:06:08.820
LAURENCE MORONEY: Did
you film that scene last,

00:06:08.820 --> 00:06:09.810
or did you film it first?

00:06:09.810 --> 00:06:10.810
MAGNUS HYTTSTEN: Yeah,
it was the last scene,

00:06:10.810 --> 00:06:11.700
so that was a good thing.

00:06:11.700 --> 00:06:13.010
LAURENCE MORONEY: OK, so
that's not so bad, cool.

00:06:13.010 --> 00:06:15.085
Now Google I/O last
year, you had a session,

00:06:15.085 --> 00:06:17.210
and I hear it was a really
highly engaging session,

00:06:17.210 --> 00:06:18.876
and you even brought
a T-shirt launcher?

00:06:18.876 --> 00:06:19.560
Is that right?

00:06:19.560 --> 00:06:21.010
MAGNUS HYTTSTEN: That's right.

00:06:21.010 --> 00:06:24.650
We thought, how do we
make Google I/O engaging?

00:06:24.650 --> 00:06:27.360
How can we actually
get the audience

00:06:27.360 --> 00:06:29.727
interacting with the speech?

00:06:29.727 --> 00:06:32.310
Because you're sitting there and
it's hundreds of people down,

00:06:32.310 --> 00:06:34.020
and you can't ask
specific questions

00:06:34.020 --> 00:06:36.070
or engage with
individual people.

00:06:36.070 --> 00:06:38.880
So we got this idea
from a TV show,

00:06:38.880 --> 00:06:40.850
and we essentially ordered
a T-shirt launcher.

00:06:40.850 --> 00:06:42.851
It's sitting down right
there in my cabinet now.

00:06:42.851 --> 00:06:44.350
LAURENCE MORONEY:
Haha, I know where

00:06:44.350 --> 00:06:46.480
I'm going when we're
done shooting this video.

00:06:46.480 --> 00:06:48.896
MAGNUS HYTTSTEN: Under my desk,
right, just sitting there.

00:06:48.896 --> 00:06:51.230
I haven't been using it
since Google I/O last year.

00:06:51.230 --> 00:06:53.870
So Google I/O is
coming up soon, so I

00:06:53.870 --> 00:06:57.560
think it's a good opportunity
to, in the next couple of days,

00:06:57.560 --> 00:06:59.740
take that thing out
and see if it works.

00:06:59.740 --> 00:07:00.520
LAURENCE MORONEY:
Sounds like fun.

00:07:00.520 --> 00:07:02.300
So we'll be seeing you
at I/O again this year?

00:07:02.300 --> 00:07:04.230
MAGNUS HYTTSTEN: Absolutely,
I'll have a lot of fun.

00:07:04.230 --> 00:07:05.610
LAURENCE MORONEY: Yeah, I'm
looking forward to it, too.

00:07:05.610 --> 00:07:06.490
MAGNUS HYTTSTEN: OK.

00:07:06.490 --> 00:07:08.030
LAURENCE MORONEY: Well thanks
so much, Magnus, for coming.

00:07:08.030 --> 00:07:09.120
This was a whole lot of fun.

00:07:09.120 --> 00:07:09.940
We learned so much.

00:07:09.940 --> 00:07:10.520
MAGNUS HYTTSTEN: Thank you.

00:07:10.520 --> 00:07:11.140
LAURENCE MORONEY:
Thanks everybody

00:07:11.140 --> 00:07:12.056
for watching this far.

00:07:12.056 --> 00:07:15.150
This was Magnus Hyttsten talking
about Google Play Services.

00:07:15.150 --> 00:07:18.030
We called it Parmesan,
but it's also Release 7.3.

00:07:18.030 --> 00:07:19.450
So watch out for his video.

00:07:19.450 --> 00:07:21.890
