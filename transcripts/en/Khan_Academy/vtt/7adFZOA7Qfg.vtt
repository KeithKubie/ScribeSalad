00:00:00.170 --> 00:00:02.270
- [Instructor] In this video,
we're going to think about

00:00:02.270 --> 00:00:05.760
how trade can alter the equilibrium

00:00:05.760 --> 00:00:09.290
price and quantity in a given market.

00:00:09.290 --> 00:00:11.190
So what we see here, as we like to do,

00:00:11.190 --> 00:00:13.810
are very simplified examples of markets

00:00:13.810 --> 00:00:15.700
in various economies.

00:00:15.700 --> 00:00:17.360
So first, we have country A,

00:00:17.360 --> 00:00:21.110
and let's say it's the market for widgets.

00:00:21.110 --> 00:00:22.790
And we're going to assume that country A

00:00:22.790 --> 00:00:25.040
is not trading with anyone else.

00:00:25.040 --> 00:00:29.030
So it is an autarky, a very
fancy word, which just means

00:00:29.030 --> 00:00:31.550
that this country is
operating independently.

00:00:31.550 --> 00:00:33.620
It's operating in isolation.

00:00:33.620 --> 00:00:36.160
And so you can see the demand curve

00:00:36.160 --> 00:00:38.900
in this market in orange,

00:00:38.900 --> 00:00:40.990
and we can see the supply curve.

00:00:40.990 --> 00:00:41.870
And you can see,

00:00:41.870 --> 00:00:45.370
when this country is
operating in isolation,

00:00:45.370 --> 00:00:48.660
this market for widgets
has an equilibrium price.

00:00:48.660 --> 00:00:51.280
It looks like it's a little bit under $4.

00:00:51.280 --> 00:00:54.260
I'll just assume that the
price is in dollars per widget.

00:00:54.260 --> 00:00:56.380
And the equilibrium quantity

00:00:56.380 --> 00:00:59.560
looks like it's about a
little under four units

00:00:59.560 --> 00:01:01.840
per whatever time period we're looking at.

00:01:01.840 --> 00:01:03.110
Fair enough.

00:01:03.110 --> 00:01:04.850
Now let's look at country B,

00:01:04.850 --> 00:01:08.160
and let's assume that they are
also operating independently.

00:01:08.160 --> 00:01:10.400
It's an autarky in this market.

00:01:10.400 --> 00:01:13.040
And so here, we can see a different

00:01:13.040 --> 00:01:15.920
demand curve than what we saw in country A

00:01:15.920 --> 00:01:18.530
and a different supply curve.

00:01:18.530 --> 00:01:21.210
And notice they have a different

00:01:21.210 --> 00:01:24.240
equilibrium price and quantity.

00:01:24.240 --> 00:01:26.210
So here, the equilibrium price

00:01:26.210 --> 00:01:28.910
seems to be a little bit over $1,

00:01:28.910 --> 00:01:32.690
and the equilibrium quantity
seems to actually be

00:01:32.690 --> 00:01:37.050
not that different than what
we saw in the first country.

00:01:37.050 --> 00:01:40.180
Although, in many situations,
it could be very different.

00:01:40.180 --> 00:01:42.340
Now let's imagine what would happen

00:01:42.340 --> 00:01:46.960
if they opened up their
economies to each other.

00:01:46.960 --> 00:01:48.650
Well, then you would essentially

00:01:48.650 --> 00:01:51.450
horizontally add these two demand curves,

00:01:51.450 --> 00:01:54.210
and you would horizontally
add these two supply curves

00:01:54.210 --> 00:01:57.040
to come up with a new supply curve

00:01:57.040 --> 00:02:00.480
and a new demand curve. This
is a little bit of a review

00:02:00.480 --> 00:02:02.430
of what we've seen in other videos.

00:02:02.430 --> 00:02:06.560
But notice, at a price of five,

00:02:06.560 --> 00:02:09.470
in total, no one's demanding anything,

00:02:09.470 --> 00:02:11.080
no quantity of these widgets.

00:02:11.080 --> 00:02:13.290
And then at a price of zero,

00:02:13.290 --> 00:02:15.640
country A, the market
there is demanding 15,

00:02:15.640 --> 00:02:17.440
and country B is demanding five.

00:02:17.440 --> 00:02:20.770
So in aggregate, they're demanding 20.

00:02:20.770 --> 00:02:23.630
And similarly, you can
see that with supply,

00:02:23.630 --> 00:02:25.940
that at a price of five,

00:02:25.940 --> 00:02:28.300
country A will supply five.

00:02:28.300 --> 00:02:31.340
And at a price of five,
country B will supply 15.

00:02:31.340 --> 00:02:36.340
And so together, they will
supply 20 units per time period.

00:02:36.600 --> 00:02:38.910
And so we can view this right over here

00:02:38.910 --> 00:02:40.550
as our supply and demand curves

00:02:40.550 --> 00:02:43.590
for the combined markets
because now they're trading.

00:02:43.590 --> 00:02:45.980
We are not in an autarky anymore.

00:02:45.980 --> 00:02:48.440
And notice what has happened.

00:02:48.440 --> 00:02:51.030
Our equilibrium price is now someplace

00:02:51.030 --> 00:02:53.980
in between these two equilibrium prices.

00:02:53.980 --> 00:02:56.640
So it looks like it's
a little bit under $3.

00:02:56.640 --> 00:02:59.450
And our equilibrium quantity,

00:02:59.450 --> 00:03:03.570
our equilibrium quantity is
a little bit under 10 units.

00:03:03.570 --> 00:03:04.810
And so you might notice

00:03:04.810 --> 00:03:07.160
some interesting things
that are happening.

00:03:07.160 --> 00:03:09.010
What would happen from a,

00:03:09.010 --> 00:03:11.370
someone in country A's point of view,

00:03:11.370 --> 00:03:13.380
the people who are the buyers,

00:03:13.380 --> 00:03:16.480
the people who are demanding this widget?

00:03:16.480 --> 00:03:18.900
Well, now, instead of
having to pay almost four,

00:03:18.900 --> 00:03:21.160
they're paying someplace
in between two and three.

00:03:21.160 --> 00:03:24.140
This is the new equilibrium price

00:03:24.140 --> 00:03:26.340
if they were to open up their economy.

00:03:26.340 --> 00:03:29.850
And so what you have is, is that this,

00:03:29.850 --> 00:03:31.820
this amount would be produced by,

00:03:31.820 --> 00:03:34.100
in theory, by the domestic manufacturers,

00:03:34.100 --> 00:03:36.600
so the first, let's call that 2 1/2 units.

00:03:36.600 --> 00:03:38.370
And then the remainder,

00:03:38.370 --> 00:03:40.060
where are they going to
get those units from?

00:03:40.060 --> 00:03:43.430
Well, those are going to be imports.

00:03:43.430 --> 00:03:46.740
And let's look at the
equilibrium price on country B,

00:03:46.740 --> 00:03:50.420
and country B was really
the lower cost producer.

00:03:50.420 --> 00:03:52.480
And so country B, now we have a,

00:03:52.480 --> 00:03:54.910
let's put it a little bit over 2.5,

00:03:54.910 --> 00:03:57.440
so let's put it right over there.

00:03:57.440 --> 00:04:00.410
And so now you have a
situation where the suppliers

00:04:00.410 --> 00:04:03.930
in country B are going
to be producing a lot,

00:04:03.930 --> 00:04:05.980
a lot more than they were before.

00:04:05.980 --> 00:04:10.850
And only this amount is coming
from their domestic demand.

00:04:10.850 --> 00:04:13.240
And then all of this
amount right over here,

00:04:13.240 --> 00:04:15.830
that is being exported.

00:04:15.830 --> 00:04:18.630
And if we're assuming
that the world economy

00:04:18.630 --> 00:04:20.480
is only made up of country A and country B

00:04:20.480 --> 00:04:22.390
or that they're only
trading with each other,

00:04:22.390 --> 00:04:26.200
these exports become country A's

00:04:26.200 --> 00:04:28.760
imports right over there.

00:04:28.760 --> 00:04:31.840
And so proponents of free
trade will say, hey, look,

00:04:31.840 --> 00:04:35.910
the overall consumer surplus is larger

00:04:35.910 --> 00:04:39.270
than the combined consumer
surpluses that we had before.

00:04:39.270 --> 00:04:42.030
Before, you had this consumer
surplus in country A.

00:04:42.030 --> 00:04:43.700
And country B,

00:04:43.700 --> 00:04:46.540
it was all of this.

00:04:46.540 --> 00:04:48.850
But still, this entire area is larger

00:04:48.850 --> 00:04:50.330
than these two combined.

00:04:50.330 --> 00:04:52.500
And you could do it
mathematically if you like,

00:04:52.500 --> 00:04:54.970
calculate the area of these triangles.

00:04:54.970 --> 00:04:56.470
And if you look at the producer surplus,

00:04:56.470 --> 00:04:57.950
you'll see a similar story.

00:04:57.950 --> 00:05:01.590
The total producer surplus of
the combined economies now,

00:05:01.590 --> 00:05:05.420
this is going to be larger
than this producer surplus

00:05:05.420 --> 00:05:07.600
plus this producer surplus.

00:05:07.600 --> 00:05:08.690
Now, some,

00:05:08.690 --> 00:05:11.570
there will not always be winners in this.

00:05:11.570 --> 00:05:15.900
The winners here are the
demanders in country A.

00:05:15.900 --> 00:05:19.820
Because instead of this
little, small consumer surplus

00:05:19.820 --> 00:05:23.860
that they had before, now
they have this much larger

00:05:23.860 --> 00:05:26.090
consumer surplus right over there.

00:05:26.090 --> 00:05:29.530
And then the other winners are
the suppliers in country B.

00:05:29.530 --> 00:05:31.900
'Cause instead of this producer surplus

00:05:31.900 --> 00:05:33.060
that they had before,

00:05:33.060 --> 00:05:35.980
they now have this producer surplus.

00:05:35.980 --> 00:05:37.930
But the losers in this situation

00:05:37.930 --> 00:05:40.600
are the suppliers in country A

00:05:40.600 --> 00:05:44.010
who now have a much
lower producer surplus.

00:05:44.010 --> 00:05:47.280
So their triangle has shrunk
to that right over there.

00:05:47.280 --> 00:05:49.500
And then the other
losers in this situation

00:05:49.500 --> 00:05:51.340
are the consumers in country B

00:05:51.340 --> 00:05:53.470
who now have to pay a
higher equilibrium price.

00:05:53.470 --> 00:05:58.360
And so their consumer surplus
is only this small triangle,

00:05:58.360 --> 00:06:01.230
when before it was this whole thing.

00:06:01.230 --> 00:06:03.780
So anyway, the big takeaway here is,

00:06:03.780 --> 00:06:08.240
is that if you go from autarky
to opening up economies,

00:06:08.240 --> 00:06:10.880
it can affect what the equilibrium

00:06:10.880 --> 00:06:13.660
prices and quantities are going to be.

00:06:13.660 --> 00:06:16.920
And oftentimes or usually,
it's going to increase

00:06:16.920 --> 00:06:20.010
your total consumer and producer surplus.

00:06:20.010 --> 00:06:21.700
Although, there will be some winners,

00:06:21.700 --> 00:06:23.363
and there will be some losers.
