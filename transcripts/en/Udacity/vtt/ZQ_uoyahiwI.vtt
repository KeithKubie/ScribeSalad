00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.000
One method to get from A to B across a vast body of water is known as dead reckoning.

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:11.000
So what's dead reckoning. In dead reckoning, we start with a known location--city A.

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:15.000
Then we're going to keep track of our ship's heading and its speed to determine

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:20.000
where in this route from A to B we might actually B located.

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:26.000
So for example, let's say our ship's started off moving for 1 hour east at a speed of 10 km/h.

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:31.000
Well, east is this way and 10 km/h for 1 hour means I've moved 10 km,

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:36.000
and I can follow this sort of thinking as long as I keep good track of duration, heading and speed.

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:43.000
So 2 hours at southeast at 8 km/h but by 1 hour south at 5--so you get a feel for where you are

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:45.000
just by using this sort of dead reckoning method.

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:48.000
Of course, this method has some problems.

00:00:48.000 --> 99:59:59.000
For example, how do you know the speed of your boat.
