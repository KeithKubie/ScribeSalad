00:00:03.419 --> 00:00:10.370
Rise and shine, New Horizons, you’re almost
at Pluto!

00:00:10.370 --> 00:00:12.330
Hey guys, Amy here for DNews.

00:00:12.330 --> 00:00:16.269
Whether or not you think Pluto is a planet,
it’s a fascinating little body, and after

00:00:16.269 --> 00:00:20.990
eight years, the first ever dedicated mission
to the dwarf planet, New Horizons, is waking

00:00:20.990 --> 00:00:23.210
up from hibernation to start it’s main mission.

00:00:23.210 --> 00:00:25.250
It’s sort of a landmark moment.

00:00:25.250 --> 00:00:32.550
Since it launched on January 19, 2006, New
Horizons has spent 1,873 days in hibernation.

00:00:32.550 --> 00:00:35.960
That’s about two thirds of its flight lifetime!

00:00:35.960 --> 00:00:40.190
Hibernation mode is vital on a mission like
this because Pluto is really far away.

00:00:40.190 --> 00:00:46.690
1 AU is the distance from the Sun to the Earth,
And Pluto never comes closer than 29.7 AU

00:00:46.690 --> 00:00:47.690
to the Sun.

00:00:47.690 --> 00:00:50.440
At it’s furthest, it’s 49.3 AU!

00:00:50.440 --> 00:00:54.619
Keeping the spacecraft in an unpowered, hibernating
state while it crosses these insanely large

00:00:54.619 --> 00:00:59.499
distances is crucial for conserving power
and reducing wear and tear on spacecraft systems

00:00:59.499 --> 00:01:00.620
to keep it healthy.

00:01:00.620 --> 00:01:02.699
But it isn’t exactly just powered off.

00:01:02.699 --> 00:01:05.820
Onboard flight computers have been monitoring
the systems’ health and sending a weekly

00:01:05.820 --> 00:01:07.729
beacon-status tone back to Earth.

00:01:07.729 --> 00:01:12.170
And of course, it’s woken up for some exciting
moments like encounters with Jupiter and Saturn.

00:01:12.170 --> 00:01:13.369
But this is the big one.

00:01:13.369 --> 00:01:17.420
We’re at Pluto’s doorstep and about to
get into some really exciting science.

00:01:17.420 --> 00:01:21.110
New Horizons is set to wake up at 3 p.m. Eastern
Time on December 6.

00:01:21.110 --> 00:01:26.030
At the time it will be 2.9 billion miles from
Earth, but just a relatively short hop from

00:01:26.030 --> 00:01:29.869
Pluto; it will be 162 million miles from the
dwarf planet.

00:01:29.869 --> 00:01:33.820
Once it wakes, it will send an electronic
word back to Earth confirming it’s in active

00:01:33.820 --> 00:01:37.420
mode, then the team will run systems checks
and get data back that’s been stored on

00:01:37.420 --> 00:01:38.640
the spacecraft.

00:01:38.640 --> 00:01:41.030
Then before you know it we’ll be at Pluto.

00:01:41.030 --> 00:01:43.920
This is actually going to a really exciting
mission.

00:01:43.920 --> 00:01:48.069
Not only is this the first ever dedicated
mission to Pluto, this is the first spacecraft

00:01:48.069 --> 00:01:53.310
to go beyond Saturn since the Voyager spacecraft
reached the outer solar system in the 1980s.

00:01:53.310 --> 00:01:57.159
And needless to say, the instruments on New
Horizons are far more modern and updated than

00:01:57.159 --> 00:02:00.889
those aboard the Voyagers that were built
and launched in the 1970s.

00:02:00.889 --> 00:02:04.219
But more than just great data, we’re going
to learn some really neat things.

00:02:04.219 --> 00:02:07.890
Pluto and its largest moon Charon are a binary
system the same way the Earth and the Moon

00:02:07.890 --> 00:02:10.360
are, the only other such pair in the solar
system.

00:02:10.360 --> 00:02:14.730
Pluto’s scant atmosphere is also escaping
from the little planet extremely quickly,

00:02:14.730 --> 00:02:18.390
much in the same way scientists think the
atmosphere poured off the early Earth.

00:02:18.390 --> 00:02:23.150
It’s quite possible that New Horizons’
close encounter with Pluto in July of 2015

00:02:23.150 --> 00:02:26.989
will teach us as much about our now planet
as it will about the dwarf planet.

00:02:26.989 --> 00:02:29.040
It’s definitely a mission to watch.

00:02:29.040 --> 00:02:32.099
Are you guys excited for New Horizons’ encounter
with Pluto next summer?
