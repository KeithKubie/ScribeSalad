00:00:07.430 --> 00:00:11.480
He may have been a major player in the pages
of Marvel Comics for over half a century,

00:00:11.480 --> 00:00:15.950
but it was only recently that Captain America
became the poster boy for the Marvel Cinematic

00:00:15.950 --> 00:00:16.950
Universe.

00:00:16.950 --> 00:00:20.860
The quintessential hero, it’s almost impossible
to imagine what kind of fight would force

00:00:20.860 --> 00:00:23.640
him to turn against his fellow Avengers.

00:00:23.640 --> 00:00:27.640
But you might be surprised to find out that
the comic book history of the squeaky clean,

00:00:27.640 --> 00:00:30.050
star spangled Boy Scout is as dark as they
come.

00:00:30.050 --> 00:00:34.370
And if fans of comic book movies think their
superhero blockbusters are getting a little

00:00:34.370 --> 00:00:39.520
too dark, violent, or serious, they’d better
hope these famous moments from Captain America’s

00:00:39.520 --> 00:00:41.160
history are never adapted.

00:00:41.160 --> 00:00:44.560
But they’re still stories every fan should
know, so we’ve made them the focus of our

00:00:44.560 --> 00:00:53.530
latest Docu Series: The Shockingly DARK History
of Captain America.

00:00:53.530 --> 00:00:56.160
The Original Captain America

00:00:56.160 --> 00:01:00.469
Looking back now, it makes perfect sense for
Cap to have made his debut in a solo comic,

00:01:00.469 --> 00:01:02.560
punching out Adolf Hitler on the front cover.

00:01:02.560 --> 00:01:07.789
But remember: the first comic was released
in 1941, a full year before the United States

00:01:07.789 --> 00:01:09.600
even entered World War 2.

00:01:09.600 --> 00:01:13.670
So to a large part of the American public
who weren’t looking to go to war with Germany,

00:01:13.670 --> 00:01:18.340
the star-spangled hero made his debut knocking
a foreign head of state unconscious.

00:01:18.340 --> 00:01:22.340
The move proved controversial, since the world
didn’t know just what Hitler’s Third Reich

00:01:22.340 --> 00:01:27.880
was up to, but it didn’t stop Timely Comics,
the original publishers, since the comics

00:01:27.880 --> 00:01:33.120
that followed were huge successes, showing
Cap knocking out Nazis of all shapes and sizes.

00:01:33.120 --> 00:01:37.530
The stories inside the comics were a bit different,
but remember: Steve Rogers and his sidekick

00:01:37.530 --> 00:01:43.350
Bucky Barnes were American soldiers first
– so while DC’s Batman was snapping criminals’

00:01:43.350 --> 00:01:47.950
necks, Cap and Bucky were wiping out Nazi
soldiers one grenade at a time.

00:01:47.950 --> 00:01:52.670
It was war, sure, but that didn’t stop Marvel
from rewriting history years later to keep

00:01:52.670 --> 00:01:58.380
Cap’s killing to a minimum.

00:01:58.380 --> 00:02:00.920
Captain America Goes To Hell

00:02:00.920 --> 00:02:03.840
Things got weird with Captain America almost
immediately.

00:02:03.840 --> 00:02:07.530
Once the war came to an end, the writers had
to find a new purpose for Cap – and had

00:02:07.530 --> 00:02:08.899
serious trouble doing it.

00:02:08.899 --> 00:02:14.489
After just 70 issues, Cap and his famous enemy
Red Skull had fought in so many weird places,

00:02:14.489 --> 00:02:17.040
there was just one left to go: Hell.

00:02:17.040 --> 00:02:21.060
Descending into the underworld in “Captain
America’s Weird Tales” and forced to kill

00:02:21.060 --> 00:02:26.279
Red Skull or remain there for God, Cap came
through, unsure if it was all a dream – or

00:02:26.279 --> 00:02:27.640
completely real.

00:02:27.640 --> 00:02:32.439
Not surprising, it was the final issue he
would appear in before joining plenty of his

00:02:32.439 --> 00:02:34.900
fellow superheroes on the shelf.

00:02:34.900 --> 00:02:37.049

00:02:37.049 --> 00:02:38.969
Captain America: Commie Smasher

00:02:38.969 --> 00:02:44.249
It wasn’t long before a new political crisis
seemed perfect for Captain America: the red

00:02:44.249 --> 00:02:47.469
menace, also known as Communism spreading
around the globe.

00:02:47.469 --> 00:02:52.739
The paranoia of the 1950s is usually remembered
as a mistake, and Captain America shows why:

00:02:52.739 --> 00:02:57.981
returning as “Captain America: Commie Smasher,”
there was no actual threat or enemy for Cap

00:02:57.981 --> 00:02:58.981
to fight.

00:02:58.981 --> 00:03:03.199
So weird Soviet monsters, or Southeast Asian
villains were created in hopes they could

00:03:03.199 --> 00:03:06.469
drum up the same patriotic excitement as a
decade before.

00:03:06.469 --> 00:03:11.489
They didn’t, and the obvious racism and
bigotry in Cap and Bucky battling people based

00:03:11.489 --> 00:03:15.019
on their politics or ethnicity seemed to prove
that his time had passed.

00:03:15.019 --> 00:03:18.659
Or, a new mission was needed, at least.

00:03:18.659 --> 00:03:20.870
Captain America: The Murderer

00:03:20.870 --> 00:03:25.060
We know what you’re thinking: if Steve Roger
was frozen in the 1940s, how could he have

00:03:25.060 --> 00:03:26.999
been smashing Commies a decade later?

00:03:26.999 --> 00:03:30.689
That’s a question that Stan Lee ignored
completely, even though he wrote the stories

00:03:30.689 --> 00:03:31.689
in question.

00:03:31.689 --> 00:03:36.650
In 1964, Lee locked Cap’s origin in for
good, having been frozen, and thawed out by

00:03:36.650 --> 00:03:37.979
the Avengers years later.

00:03:37.979 --> 00:03:43.390
It was here that Steve’s Super-Soldier procedure
was completely fleshed out, with Lee confirming

00:03:43.390 --> 00:03:46.409
one detail that seems pretty important in
hindsight.

00:03:46.409 --> 00:03:50.959
That German spy who killed the brilliant scientist
behind the serum?

00:03:50.959 --> 00:03:53.150
Steve killed him almost immediately.

00:03:53.150 --> 00:03:56.150
Brutally beating him and throwing him into
running machinery.

00:03:56.150 --> 00:04:01.930
But don’t worry: things are about to get
even stranger for Cap fans…

00:04:01.930 --> 00:04:04.699
Captain America vs. Captain America

00:04:04.699 --> 00:04:09.719
It wasn’t until the 1970s that Marvel finally
explained the plot hole of Cap operating in

00:04:09.719 --> 00:04:15.219
the 1950s, but instead of wiping them out
of continuity, they took an even crazier path.

00:04:15.219 --> 00:04:20.540
The Cap of the 1950s was an imposter, having
undergone plastic surgery to look the part,

00:04:20.540 --> 00:04:25.060
and injecting himself – and his sidekick
– with a reverse-engineered serum that was

00:04:25.060 --> 00:04:27.370
slowly driving them insane.

00:04:27.370 --> 00:04:28.370
Not weird enough?

00:04:28.370 --> 00:04:32.590
The imposter, now the villain known as The
Grand Director hatched a plan that saw him

00:04:32.590 --> 00:04:38.090
pose as Steve Rogers leading a wave of neo
Nazis in Harlem, splattering a swastika across

00:04:38.090 --> 00:04:39.360
his famous shield.

00:04:39.360 --> 00:04:43.270
Daredevil eventually helped save the day,
but things for the hero were only going to

00:04:43.270 --> 00:04:48.710
get weirder, and darker.

00:04:48.710 --> 00:04:51.009
Captain America Quits

00:04:51.009 --> 00:04:55.281
As the Watergate scandal and Richard Nixon’s
resignation were going on in real life, it

00:04:55.281 --> 00:04:59.250
only made sense for Captain America to reflect
the loss of faith in government – with some

00:04:59.250 --> 00:05:01.030
comic book flair, of course.

00:05:01.030 --> 00:05:05.400
In the comics, Cap fought a Secret Empire
conspiracy of his own, eventually catching

00:05:05.400 --> 00:05:09.180
its leader to realize… well, it was basically
Richard Nixon.

00:05:09.180 --> 00:05:10.180
Not dark enough?

00:05:10.180 --> 00:05:13.760
Okay, the implied president shot himself to
death in the next panel.

00:05:13.760 --> 00:05:17.780
As disillusioned as millions of Americans,
Cap turned in his uniform for good.

00:05:17.780 --> 00:05:20.490
Well, a few weeks at least.

00:05:20.490 --> 00:05:22.180
Captain America Quits…

00:05:22.180 --> 00:05:23.180
Again

00:05:23.180 --> 00:05:27.030
The Civil War story wasn’t the first time
that Cap was asked to become an official operative

00:05:27.030 --> 00:05:29.849
of the government, and the first time, his
choice was simple.

00:05:29.849 --> 00:05:34.320
Deciding he represented the American people,
not the military or government, Steve Rogers

00:05:34.320 --> 00:05:39.050
resigned, with the authorities turning to
an unlikely replacement: John Walker, formerly

00:05:39.050 --> 00:05:42.449
known as the Super Patriot, a former enemy
of Cap’s.

00:05:42.449 --> 00:05:46.599
More aggressive, more racially intolerant,
and less heroic, Walker even picked one of

00:05:46.599 --> 00:05:49.600
his immigrant-hating sidekicks as his new
Bucky.

00:05:49.600 --> 00:05:53.500
But he eventually proved he really wasn’t
cut out for so heroic a role, when he beat

00:05:53.500 --> 00:06:02.270
a supervillain to death with his bare hands.

00:06:02.270 --> 00:06:05.919
Civil War &amp; The Death of Captain America

00:06:05.919 --> 00:06:09.710
The Civil War between Cap and Iron Man playing
out on the big screen is a bit different than

00:06:09.710 --> 00:06:13.880
in the comics, when Steve and Tony Stark were
split on a major issue.

00:06:13.880 --> 00:06:17.731
Where Tony figured every superhuman should
give up their privacy, Steve saw it as the

00:06:17.731 --> 00:06:19.570
government overstepping their rights.

00:06:19.570 --> 00:06:23.280
The bloody battle that followed answered the
question of who would win, but Cap ended up

00:06:23.280 --> 00:06:24.300
surrendering anyway.

00:06:24.300 --> 00:06:29.450
He even faced his charges and sentence willingly,
but never got to serve them, getting a stomach

00:06:29.450 --> 00:06:31.819
full of bullets on the steps of the courthouse.

00:06:31.819 --> 00:06:36.330
It’s as good and dark a death as any superhero
could hope for, but just like the others,

00:06:36.330 --> 00:06:38.669
it didn’t last for long…

00:06:38.669 --> 00:06:39.669
So what do you think?

00:06:39.669 --> 00:06:43.469
Should these dark chapters of Captain America’s
history be brought to the big screen?

00:06:43.469 --> 00:06:45.090
Or are they better left forgotten?

00:06:45.090 --> 00:06:48.620
Are there any dark stories of your own favorite
superheroes that have these ones beat?
