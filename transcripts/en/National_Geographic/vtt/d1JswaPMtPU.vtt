00:00:00.734 --> 00:00:01.934
NEIL DEGRASSE TYSON:

00:00:01.934 --> 00:00:05.200
with science communicator
extraordinaire Bill Nye.

00:00:05.200 --> 00:00:08.033
And I asked how his
interest in comedy

00:00:08.033 --> 00:00:09.500
and his background
in engineering

00:00:09.500 --> 00:00:13.633
coalesced into the identity
of the Science Guy.

00:00:13.633 --> 00:00:15.100
Let's check it out.

00:00:15.100 --> 00:00:17.100
BILL NYE: It's a wonderful
thing to get people

00:00:17.100 --> 00:00:19.033
to laugh at your comedy jokes.

00:00:19.033 --> 00:00:22.967
And so I started doing standup,
or trying to do standup.

00:00:22.967 --> 00:00:24.734
NEIL DEGRASSE TYSON: Like
in standup clubs and stuff.

00:00:24.734 --> 00:00:25.667
BILL NYE: Yeah, yeah.

00:00:25.667 --> 00:00:27.233
So I would work on
a drawing board,

00:00:27.233 --> 00:00:29.100
and then I would go
home, and take a nap,

00:00:29.100 --> 00:00:30.300
and then go to comedy clubs.

00:00:30.300 --> 00:00:31.667
NEIL DEGRASSE TYSON:
So you were engineer

00:00:31.667 --> 00:00:33.633
by day, comedian by night.

00:00:33.633 --> 00:00:35.066
BILL NYE: That's it, Yes.

00:00:35.066 --> 00:00:36.934
Or that's I was trying to do.

00:00:36.934 --> 00:00:38.533
The problem, the thing
that always troubles--

00:00:38.533 --> 00:00:40.333
NEIL DEGRASSE TYSON: Is
engineering still in your head

00:00:40.333 --> 00:00:41.133
at some point?

00:00:41.133 --> 00:00:42.300
BILL NYE: Yeah, I miss it.

00:00:42.300 --> 00:00:43.800
NEIL DEGRASSE TYSON:
While you're doing that.

00:00:43.800 --> 00:00:45.200
BILL NYE: Yeah, I, yeah,

00:00:45.200 --> 00:00:47.233
NEIL DEGRASSE TYSON: So was the
schtick engineering informed?

00:00:47.233 --> 00:00:49.133
BILL NYE: Yes that's
what I say, hilarious

00:00:49.133 --> 00:00:51.100
jokes about
electrocuting yourself

00:00:51.100 --> 00:00:52.367
while trying to fix a blender.

00:00:52.367 --> 00:00:54.533
Wow, is that funny.

00:00:54.533 --> 00:00:57.633
And chewing marshmallows
frozen in liquid nitrogen

00:00:57.633 --> 00:00:59.734
so that steam comes
out of your nose.

00:00:59.734 --> 00:01:02.400
It's hilarious, come
on, it's a payoff.

00:01:02.400 --> 00:01:04.834
And I realized that
what I wanted to do--

00:01:04.834 --> 00:01:08.066
you know, I came
of age at a time,

00:01:08.066 --> 00:01:11.333
for me as a mechanical engineer,
it was really troubling.

00:01:11.333 --> 00:01:15.300
We had the Chevy Vega
and the Ford Pinto.

00:01:15.300 --> 00:01:18.400
And these were just
badly designed cars.

00:01:18.400 --> 00:01:20.800
The Administration
decided not to embrace

00:01:20.800 --> 00:01:24.000
the metric system, something you
and I haven't fully agreed on,

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:25.367
is my belief.

00:01:25.367 --> 00:01:26.800
NEIL DEGRASSE TYSON:
This is America, Jack.

00:01:26.800 --> 00:01:27.900
BILL NYE: Yeah, yeah, yeah.

00:01:27.900 --> 00:01:29.100
I felt like the
United States was

00:01:29.100 --> 00:01:31.767
falling behind industrially.

00:01:31.767 --> 00:01:33.734
NEIL DEGRASSE TYSON:
This is America.

00:01:33.734 --> 00:01:35.700
BILL NYE: So I got very
concerned about the future.

00:01:35.700 --> 00:01:37.166
I'm not kidding, very concerned.

00:01:37.166 --> 00:01:40.567
And I realized, working at
the Science Center in Seattle,

00:01:40.567 --> 00:01:42.133
that young people were
the key to the future.

00:01:42.133 --> 00:01:45.133
I mean, this is obvious,
but they're the key

00:01:45.133 --> 00:01:46.333
to our industrial future.

00:01:46.333 --> 00:01:49.166
They're the key to our
economic competitiveness.

00:01:49.166 --> 00:01:50.533
They're--

00:01:50.533 --> 00:01:51.934
NEIL DEGRASSE TYSON: The key
to the future of civilization.

00:01:51.934 --> 00:01:53.133
BILL NYE: Civilization.

00:01:53.133 --> 00:01:55.934
And so I wanted to get
kids excited about science

00:01:55.934 --> 00:01:58.233
in the same way I had been
excited about science,

00:01:58.233 --> 00:02:00.800
by my teachers and
a television guy

00:02:00.800 --> 00:02:02.367
named Don Herbert, Mr. Wizard.

00:02:02.367 --> 00:02:03.800
NEIL DEGRASSE TYSON:
I remember Mr. Wizard.

00:02:03.800 --> 00:02:04.734
So all this came together--

00:02:04.734 --> 00:02:05.967
BILL NYE: That's right.

00:02:05.967 --> 00:02:08.867
NEIL DEGRASSE TYSON: --into
a unique arc of life.

00:02:08.867 --> 00:02:10.467
BILL NYE: That's my claim.

00:02:10.467 --> 00:02:12.133
That's my story.

00:02:12.133 --> 00:02:13.333
[applause]
