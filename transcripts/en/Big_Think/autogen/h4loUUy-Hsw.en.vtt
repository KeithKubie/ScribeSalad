think often we need to think creatively

00:00:43.130 --> 00:00:43.140
think often we need to think creatively
 

00:00:43.140 --> 00:00:44.990
think often we need to think creatively
about how can we change the problem or

00:00:44.990 --> 00:00:45.000
about how can we change the problem or
 

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:46.760
about how can we change the problem or
look at the problem differently people

00:00:46.760 --> 00:00:46.770
look at the problem differently people
 

00:00:46.770 --> 00:00:48.740
look at the problem differently people
might ask well you know how how far do

00:00:48.740 --> 00:00:48.750
might ask well you know how how far do
 

00:00:48.750 --> 00:00:50.299

you have to go with this you know aren't

you have to go with this you know aren't
 

00:00:50.309 --> 00:00:52.250
you have to go with this you know aren't
we actually facing resource constraints

00:00:52.250 --> 00:00:52.260
we actually facing resource constraints
 

00:00:52.260 --> 00:00:53.510
we actually facing resource constraints
aren't there times and we have to let

00:00:53.510 --> 00:00:53.520
aren't there times and we have to let
 

00:00:53.520 --> 00:00:56.240
aren't there times and we have to let
people die and I think I was listening

00:00:56.240 --> 00:00:56.250
people die and I think I was listening
 

00:00:56.250 --> 00:00:59.299
people die and I think I was listening
to this podcast of a I think it was in

00:00:59.299 --> 00:00:59.309
to this podcast of a I think it was in
 

00:00:59.309 --> 00:01:02.240
to this podcast of a I think it was in
New Orleans where they had a hospital

00:01:02.240 --> 00:01:02.250
New Orleans where they had a hospital
 

00:01:02.250 --> 00:01:05.299
New Orleans where they had a hospital
and they had to do triage because the

00:01:05.299 --> 00:01:05.309
and they had to do triage because the
 

00:01:05.309 --> 00:01:07.250
and they had to do triage because the
the helicopters were coming to save

00:01:07.250 --> 00:01:07.260
the helicopters were coming to save
 

00:01:07.260 --> 00:01:10.060
the helicopters were coming to save
everybody and it was in the flood and so

00:01:10.060 --> 00:01:10.070
everybody and it was in the flood and so
 

00:01:10.070 --> 00:01:13.070
everybody and it was in the flood and so
there's this nurse who had resuscitated

00:01:13.070 --> 00:01:13.080
there's this nurse who had resuscitated
 

00:01:13.080 --> 00:01:15.740
there's this nurse who had resuscitated
somebody and she was pumping this oxygen

00:01:15.740 --> 00:01:15.750
somebody and she was pumping this oxygen
 

00:01:15.750 --> 00:01:20.570
somebody and she was pumping this oxygen
bag and the the doctor says her look

00:01:20.570 --> 00:01:20.580
bag and the the doctor says her look
 

00:01:20.580 --> 00:01:22.039
bag and the the doctor says her look
you're gonna have to let that guy go the

00:01:22.039 --> 00:01:22.049
you're gonna have to let that guy go the
 

00:01:22.049 --> 00:01:23.600
you're gonna have to let that guy go the
helicopters just aren't coming

00:01:23.600 --> 00:01:23.610
helicopters just aren't coming
 

00:01:23.610 --> 00:01:26.090
helicopters just aren't coming
and so she holds the sky in her arms

00:01:26.090 --> 00:01:26.100
and so she holds the sky in her arms
 

00:01:26.100 --> 00:01:28.249
and so she holds the sky in her arms
well he dies and I think that's the

00:01:28.249 --> 00:01:28.259
well he dies and I think that's the
 

00:01:28.259 --> 00:01:30.230
well he dies and I think that's the
point in which we should be before we

00:01:30.230 --> 00:01:30.240
point in which we should be before we
 

00:01:30.240 --> 00:01:32.030
point in which we should be before we
give up right that creative resolve

00:01:32.030 --> 00:01:32.040
give up right that creative resolve
 

00:01:32.040 --> 00:01:33.890
give up right that creative resolve
requires us to go all the way to that

00:01:33.890 --> 00:01:33.900
requires us to go all the way to that
 

00:01:33.900 --> 00:01:36.469
requires us to go all the way to that
edge you know there were 2,000 people or

00:01:36.469 --> 00:01:36.479
edge you know there were 2,000 people or
 

00:01:36.479 --> 00:01:38.870
edge you know there were 2,000 people or
something in that hospital who were

00:01:38.870 --> 00:01:38.880
something in that hospital who were
 

00:01:38.880 --> 00:01:42.190
something in that hospital who were
largely unoccupied for the 24 or 48 or

00:01:42.190 --> 00:01:42.200
largely unoccupied for the 24 or 48 or
 

00:01:42.200 --> 00:01:44.569
largely unoccupied for the 24 or 48 or
64 hours until those hot those

00:01:44.569 --> 00:01:44.579
64 hours until those hot those
 

00:01:44.579 --> 00:01:46.429
64 hours until those hot those
helicopters came and so you know

00:01:46.429 --> 00:01:46.439
helicopters came and so you know
 

00:01:46.439 --> 00:01:48.289
helicopters came and so you know
creative resolve but would think you

00:01:48.289 --> 00:01:48.299
creative resolve but would think you
 

00:01:48.299 --> 00:01:51.050
creative resolve but would think you
know how would we how would we keep

00:01:51.050 --> 00:01:51.060
know how would we how would we keep
 

00:01:51.060 --> 00:01:53.210
know how would we how would we keep
somebody pumping that oxygen bag for the

00:01:53.210 --> 00:01:53.220
somebody pumping that oxygen bag for the
 

00:01:53.220 --> 00:01:55.370
somebody pumping that oxygen bag for the
next day or two maybe we could line

00:01:55.370 --> 00:01:55.380
next day or two maybe we could line
 

00:01:55.380 --> 00:01:58.130
next day or two maybe we could line
people up and and take turns so I think

00:01:58.130 --> 00:01:58.140
people up and and take turns so I think
 

00:01:58.140 --> 00:02:01.490
people up and and take turns so I think
we have to make the hope for for human

00:02:01.490 --> 00:02:01.500
we have to make the hope for for human
 

00:02:01.500 --> 00:02:04.459
we have to make the hope for for human
rights and global health and that

00:02:04.459 --> 00:02:04.469
rights and global health and that
 

00:02:04.469 --> 00:02:06.859
rights and global health and that
requires each of us to you know think

00:02:06.859 --> 00:02:06.869
requires each of us to you know think
 

00:02:06.869 --> 00:02:09.339
requires each of us to you know think
creatively about ways of helping people

00:02:09.339 --> 00:02:09.349
creatively about ways of helping people
 

00:02:09.349 --> 00:02:11.900
creatively about ways of helping people
my own project is this global health

pharmaceuticals consequences for global
 

00:02:18.319 --> 00:02:20.319
pharmaceuticals consequences for global
health around the world and then create

00:02:20.319 --> 00:02:20.329
health around the world and then create
 

00:02:20.329 --> 00:02:22.270
health around the world and then create
incentives for companies and other

00:02:22.270 --> 00:02:22.280
incentives for companies and other
 

00:02:22.280 --> 00:02:24.280

kind of human rights indicator that I

00:02:33.039 --> 00:02:33.049
kind of human rights indicator that I
 

00:02:33.049 --> 00:02:34.959
kind of human rights indicator that I
think could make a large difference the

00:02:34.959 --> 00:02:34.969
think could make a large difference the
 

00:02:34.969 --> 00:02:36.699
think could make a large difference the
later parts of the book I argue that

00:02:36.699 --> 00:02:36.709
later parts of the book I argue that
 

00:02:36.709 --> 00:02:38.559
later parts of the book I argue that
pharmaceutical companies are actually

00:02:38.559 --> 00:02:38.569
pharmaceutical companies are actually
 

00:02:38.569 --> 00:02:40.240
pharmaceutical companies are actually
violating rights and failing to live up

00:02:40.240 --> 00:02:40.250
violating rights and failing to live up
 

00:02:40.250 --> 00:02:42.009
violating rights and failing to live up
to their obligations when they set

00:02:42.009 --> 00:02:42.019
to their obligations when they set

impossible for people to access

impossible for people to access
essential medicines and there's

00:02:47.530 --> 00:02:47.540
essential medicines and there's
 

00:02:47.540 --> 00:02:50.379
essential medicines and there's
alternatives to doing that I think

00:02:50.379 --> 00:02:50.389
alternatives to doing that I think
 

00:02:50.389 --> 00:02:52.690
alternatives to doing that I think
there's some more fundamental questions

00:02:52.690 --> 00:02:52.700
there's some more fundamental questions
 

00:02:52.700 --> 00:02:55.360
there's some more fundamental questions
about how do we restructure our research

00:02:55.360 --> 00:02:55.370
about how do we restructure our research
 

00:02:55.370 --> 00:02:57.490
about how do we restructure our research
and development systems to reward

kinds of consequences for global health
so rather than treating these chronic

so rather than treating these chronic

pharmaceutical companies can make the

00:03:07.720 --> 00:03:07.730
pharmaceutical companies can make the
 

00:03:07.730 --> 00:03:08.890
pharmaceutical companies can make the
most money if we can give them

00:03:08.890 --> 00:03:08.900
most money if we can give them
 

00:03:08.900 --> 00:03:10.899
most money if we can give them
incentives to focus on the largest

00:03:10.899 --> 00:03:10.909
incentives to focus on the largest
 

00:03:10.909 --> 00:03:12.819
incentives to focus on the largest
health problems around the world I think

00:03:12.819 --> 00:03:12.829
health problems around the world I think
 

00:03:12.829 --> 00:03:15.759
health problems around the world I think
that would be absolutely fantastic and

00:03:15.759 --> 00:03:15.769
that would be absolutely fantastic and
 

00:03:15.769 --> 00:03:17.530
that would be absolutely fantastic and
so the idea of you know creating

00:03:17.530 --> 00:03:17.540
so the idea of you know creating
 

00:03:17.540 --> 00:03:19.479
so the idea of you know creating
something like a fair trade label that

00:03:19.479 --> 00:03:19.489
something like a fair trade label that
 

00:03:19.489 --> 00:03:21.789
something like a fair trade label that
pharmaceutical companies might love

00:03:21.789 --> 00:03:21.799
pharmaceutical companies might love
 

00:03:21.799 --> 00:03:24.189
pharmaceutical companies might love
because they could make more for

00:03:24.189 --> 00:03:24.199
because they could make more for
 

00:03:24.199 --> 00:03:25.569
because they could make more for
products that have these labels if

00:03:25.569 --> 00:03:25.579
products that have these labels if
 

00:03:25.579 --> 00:03:27.969
products that have these labels if
people are willing to incentivize them

00:03:27.969 --> 00:03:27.979
people are willing to incentivize them
 

00:03:27.979 --> 00:03:30.520
people are willing to incentivize them
to try to get that label based on having

00:03:30.520 --> 00:03:30.530
to try to get that label based on having
 

00:03:30.530 --> 00:03:32.740
to try to get that label based on having
a larger health impact that could be

00:03:32.740 --> 00:03:32.750
a larger health impact that could be
 

00:03:32.750 --> 00:03:35.619
a larger health impact that could be
pretty fantastic there's also a large

00:03:35.619 --> 00:03:35.629
pretty fantastic there's also a large
 

00:03:35.629 --> 00:03:37.449
