00:00:09.170 --> 00:00:11.560
BHARATH LINGAM: [x]cube LABS
is a unique organization.

00:00:11.560 --> 00:00:15.180
And we provide digital strategy
and then help enterprises

00:00:15.180 --> 00:00:17.910
so that they can see a
good future for themselves

00:00:17.910 --> 00:00:19.370
for the next few years.

00:00:19.370 --> 00:00:22.145
And we also complement it with
very strong execution skills.

00:00:22.145 --> 00:00:24.520
SAPTARSHI ROY CHAUDHURY: We
have this philosophy where we

00:00:24.520 --> 00:00:26.350
call ourselves digital natives.

00:00:26.350 --> 00:00:28.870
And one of the key traits
of being a digital native

00:00:28.870 --> 00:00:31.750
is to keep updating
yourself, upgrading yourself

00:00:31.750 --> 00:00:34.600
on the newest of technology
that's coming into the market.

00:00:34.600 --> 00:00:37.240
BHASKAR MEDHI: What truly
defines [x]cube LABS is

00:00:37.240 --> 00:00:39.790
our ability to bring all
the technology components,

00:00:39.790 --> 00:00:41.800
all the skill sets
that are needed,

00:00:41.800 --> 00:00:43.260
to solve a problem
for our client.

00:00:43.260 --> 00:00:45.040
SAPTARSHI ROY CHAUDHURY:
Our work culture

00:00:45.040 --> 00:00:46.670
is one of our biggest assets.

00:00:46.670 --> 00:00:49.480
While we are extremely
serious about having fun,

00:00:49.480 --> 00:00:51.950
you will always find
some of our programmers

00:00:51.950 --> 00:00:53.270
hack late into the night.

00:00:53.270 --> 00:00:55.353
And definitely make sure
they're going and running

00:00:55.353 --> 00:00:56.750
the Hyderabad marathon as well.

00:00:56.750 --> 00:00:59.890
These are some of the cultures
that we have very, very close

00:00:59.890 --> 00:01:00.880
to our heart.

00:01:00.880 --> 00:01:02.620
BHASKAR MEDHI: The
reason we decided

00:01:02.620 --> 00:01:04.750
to join the Google
Agency program

00:01:04.750 --> 00:01:07.000
primarily is to
help our clients.

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:09.520
We have a responsibility
to make sure

00:01:09.520 --> 00:01:12.490
that our clients have access
to the best of technologies,

00:01:12.490 --> 00:01:14.890
access to the best of tools,
to solve their problems.

00:01:14.890 --> 00:01:16.390
SAPTARSHI ROY
CHAUDHURY: So our team

00:01:16.390 --> 00:01:18.990
attended a lot of industry
events and academic events

00:01:18.990 --> 00:01:21.670
that Google conducted
for its agency partners.

00:01:21.670 --> 00:01:26.470
We learned about BWA and AMP
through a few such events.

00:01:26.470 --> 00:01:30.430
And we actually implemented BWA
for a very challenging project

00:01:30.430 --> 00:01:32.890
with one of the leading
food retailers in India.

00:01:32.890 --> 00:01:37.360
What excites me about BWA is
that it really breaks down

00:01:37.360 --> 00:01:38.930
the native barrier.

00:01:38.930 --> 00:01:41.530
And it brings in all
the native benefits

00:01:41.530 --> 00:01:44.020
on a web-based interface.

00:01:44.020 --> 00:01:46.180
At the same time,
it brings together

00:01:46.180 --> 00:01:48.870
native features, like setting
onto your home screen,

00:01:48.870 --> 00:01:52.250
popping up a push notification,
and offline access,

00:01:52.250 --> 00:01:53.655
which is really awesome.

00:01:53.655 --> 00:01:55.780
BHARATH LINGAM: I think
the Google Developer Agency

00:01:55.780 --> 00:01:57.490
program is a
wonderful opportunity

00:01:57.490 --> 00:02:01.120
to increase the collaboration
between some of the smartest

00:02:01.120 --> 00:02:04.350
technology minds and Google, as
well as provide them feedback

00:02:04.350 --> 00:02:06.490
on what are some of the
things that we would want

00:02:06.490 --> 00:02:08.590
as a development group,
three months, six

00:02:08.590 --> 00:02:10.175
months down the line.

00:02:10.175 --> 00:02:12.133
SAPTARSHI ROY CHAUDHURY:
It's a matter of pride

00:02:12.133 --> 00:02:14.740
that when we do a project
and when we design it well,

00:02:14.740 --> 00:02:17.800
our customers, the end
users, they love it.

00:02:17.800 --> 00:02:21.670
And that's probably the biggest
satisfaction that you can have.

00:02:21.670 --> 00:02:23.680
Going to the market
with the validation

00:02:23.680 --> 00:02:26.890
that we are one of the first
few Google certified agencies

00:02:26.890 --> 00:02:29.710
not only helps you
learn new technologies.

00:02:29.710 --> 00:02:32.124
It also motivates us
to keep delivering

00:02:32.124 --> 00:02:33.040
to a certain standard.

00:02:33.040 --> 00:02:35.190
