00:00:08.700 --> 00:00:10.820
&gt;&gt; Sherer: Welcome to Atlanta and Emory University

00:00:10.820 --> 00:00:11.559
&gt;&gt; Rhodes: Thank you

00:00:11.559 --> 00:00:13.279
&gt;&gt; Sherer: So tell me a little about yourself

00:00:13.279 --> 00:00:19.150
&gt;&gt; Rhodes: Well I’m a wife and a mother,
I’ve got two grown children and a husband of

00:00:19.150 --> 00:00:28.070
about 39 years now. And I worked in New York
City advertising for about 27 years, a very

00:00:28.070 --> 00:00:36.870
stressful job. But now I work as a patient
advocate and I’m a writer.

00:00:36.870 --> 00:00:43.879
&gt;&gt; Sherer: So why is February 25, 2009 forever
etched in your mind?

00:00:43.879 --> 00:00:52.079
&gt;&gt; Rhodes: Well because that was the day that
I gave up. That was the day when I cried uncle.

00:00:52.079 --> 00:01:00.329
And it had a lot to do with the stress of
my job and that time of my life. I woke up

00:01:00.329 --> 00:01:06.000
in the hospital the next day, or two days
later, no one could have been more surprised

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:14.990
than I was to have been as ill as I was with
depression. So that was the turning point

00:01:14.990 --> 00:01:25.740
for me. That was when I realized – oh I
– February 2009 is going to be my new life.

00:01:25.740 --> 00:01:35.979
&gt;&gt; Sherer: So how did your family react to
the fact that you tried to take your own life?

00:01:35.979 --> 00:01:41.189
&gt;&gt; Rhodes: Well I think first of all they
were shocked just as I was. I mean nobody,

00:01:41.189 --> 00:01:48.100
nobody knew how ill I was with the depression.
So the first reaction was utter disbelief

00:01:48.100 --> 00:01:52.950
because I was somebody who had everything
going for her: long-term marriage, two great

00:01:52.950 --> 00:01:58.409
kids, corner office in a big New York City
advertising agency. There should be no reason

00:01:58.409 --> 00:02:06.909
why I would want to kill myself. And yet because
my brain wasn’t working and I didn’t realize

00:02:06.909 --> 00:02:17.060
it I just became – I just gave up. So for
them to see me as someone who gave up, because

00:02:17.060 --> 00:02:23.400
in their eyes I was someone who was a fighter,
I was someone who had a great game face. I

00:02:23.400 --> 00:02:29.129
could pretend that I was happy. I could pretend
that I could get the job done, because of

00:02:29.129 --> 00:02:39.060
this game face that I managed to perfect.
And it was out of that, when that mask came

00:02:39.060 --> 00:02:45.069
off, that everybody went “whoa” we almost
someone special to us.

00:02:45.069 --> 00:02:51.860
&gt;&gt; Sherer: So as you know back in the mid-1990s
there was some research done here at Emory,

00:02:51.860 --> 00:02:59.340
funded by the federal government, that helped
bring TMS therapy to market. So how has TMS

00:02:59.340 --> 00:03:03.200
therapy changed your life?

00:03:03.200 --> 00:03:16.590
&gt;&gt; Rhodes: It has saved my life. TMS is new.
It was something that when I tried it I wasn’t

00:03:16.590 --> 00:03:23.010
sure if it was going to work. I call it the
F.U.D. factor; Fear, Uncertainty, and Doubt.

00:03:23.010 --> 00:03:30.480
But when I got through the initial therapy
and I felt the lift from what I call emotional

00:03:30.480 --> 00:03:37.390
nausea. Which is waking up every morning with the most disgusting “ick” feeling, worse

00:03:37.390 --> 00:03:42.849
than, 10,000 times worse than “Oh I gotta
go to work it's Monday morning feeling.”

00:03:42.849 --> 00:03:55.129
I realized that TMS was going to be therapy
that was going to work for me. It’s my go

00:03:55.129 --> 00:04:04.139
to tool in my doctor’s toolkit to keep me
healthy, to keep me well. My life is redefined.

00:04:04.139 --> 00:04:11.920
I feel clearer, I feel more centered. Before
when I was on medication I always felt like

00:04:11.920 --> 00:04:15.810
I was watching, my life was like being in
a video, watching a video. Since I’ve done

00:04:15.810 --> 00:04:22.420
TMS and I’m no longer taking medication
I feel like sitting here with you is the experience

00:04:22.420 --> 00:04:29.410
one would have being at a live theatre production
as opposed to a movie. It’s real. Life is

00:04:29.410 --> 00:04:31.750
real because of TMS.

00:04:31.750 --> 00:04:39.920
&gt;&gt; Sherer: It took a while to get to the point
where TMS was available, I think there was

00:04:39.920 --> 00:04:44.750
a year in between your initial attempt at
suicide and when you were finally able to

00:04:44.750 --> 00:04:49.140
get the relief from TMS. Tell me what that
year was like.

00:04:49.140 --> 00:04:55.690
&gt;&gt; Rhodes: That year was the lost year. I
call it the lost year. It was waking up every

00:04:55.690 --> 00:05:02.380
morning with that disgusting feeling. If I
got out of bed, although I was sleeping 14-16

00:05:02.380 --> 00:05:10.290
hours a day, I would then move to agitation
and anger that I still had to be here. Then

00:05:10.290 --> 00:05:17.110
I would move to tears and then I would be
back in bed by 8:00 at night. I didn’t socialize,

00:05:17.110 --> 00:05:23.610
I never returned phone calls, it was a dead
year. And then finally when I was able to

00:05:23.610 --> 00:05:32.700
get insurance coverage and I started TMS therapy
my life changed completely.

00:05:32.700 --> 00:05:35.960
&gt;&gt; Sherer: Tell me just a little more about
how the TMS therapy works.

00:05:35.960 --> 00:05:36.720
&gt;&gt; Rhodes: Oh it’s great.

00:05:36.720 --> 00:05:38.510
&gt;&gt; Sherer: It’s not like taking a drug.

00:05:38.510 --> 00:05:39.670
&gt;&gt; Rhodes: No it’s great.

00:05:39.670 --> 00:05:41.410
&gt;&gt; Sherer: Like you are with anti-depressants.

00:05:41.410 --> 00:05:45.970
&gt;&gt; Rhodes: It’s great. First of all it’s
so easy. This is what really surprised me.

00:05:45.970 --> 00:05:51.090
You think you know that you are going to get
your brains zapped with this coil pushing

00:05:51.090 --> 00:05:58.600
MRI strength pulses into your head. You go
in, I went in, I sat down in a spa chair,

00:05:58.600 --> 00:06:05.110
there was TV or music available to me to watch.
While the pulsing, it’s a coil that fits

00:06:05.110 --> 00:06:12.500
in a device that’s curved to the head. It
sits on the left side of the head. The worse

00:06:12.500 --> 00:06:17.300
part was getting use to the tapping which
took about a week. It’s an intense tapping

00:06:17.300 --> 00:06:24.070
but there after your in and out in 45 minutes.
I could drive myself to and from my treatments,

00:06:24.070 --> 00:06:29.820
I didn’t have to have someone shepherding
me and having to take time off from their

00:06:29.820 --> 00:06:34.580
job to get me to my treatments. When I would
leave I wouldn’t have any upset tummy, I

00:06:34.580 --> 00:06:43.110
didn’t have any disorientation, or sleepiness.
It’s almost like this is it? There’s nothing

00:06:43.110 --> 00:06:48.810
to it, except for the fact that you have to
be patient because it’s a cumulative process.

00:06:48.810 --> 00:06:55.860
So it starts out at the outer most part of
the prefrontal cortex. Over time the neurons

00:06:55.860 --> 00:07:02.330
start waking up further and further into the
brain which is where all of the neurotransmitters

00:07:02.330 --> 00:07:07.590
and all of the action happens in the brain
to adjust mood, to make me feel better. So

00:07:07.590 --> 00:07:12.460
that patience, being able to get through.
It took about two or three weeks before I

00:07:12.460 --> 00:07:20.140
felt the lift. So just being committed, being
trusting, and believing, and getting over

00:07:20.140 --> 00:07:21.740
the F.U.D. factor.

00:07:21.740 --> 00:07:26.840
&gt;&gt; Sherer: So there’s plenty of information
that shows anti-depressants and their affects

00:07:26.840 --> 00:07:31.170
are not necessarily sustainable, that they
may work for a while but not later. Is there

00:07:31.170 --> 00:07:35.660
information yet on TMS and how sustainable
the benefits of that will be?

00:07:35.660 --> 00:07:42.550
&gt;&gt; Rhodes: Yes they have done just recently
a study that was done proves that TMS is durable

00:07:42.550 --> 00:07:48.060
for at least six months and for me it was
even longer. But it’s like anything else

00:07:48.060 --> 00:07:53.440
you need to maintain, there’s no silver
bullet, no get out of jail free card here

00:07:53.440 --> 00:08:00.650
with TMS therapy. If I were on a medication
I would have to make an appointment with my

00:08:00.650 --> 00:08:07.550
doctor, get my medication reviewed, adjusted,
he writes a prescription, I go every month

00:08:07.550 --> 00:08:11.960
and I get a new prescription. It’s the same
thing with TMS. Now after I’m in my fifth

00:08:11.960 --> 00:08:17.680
anniversary, I’ve been doing this for five
years, I now realize that if I go once a month

00:08:17.680 --> 00:08:25.300
one TMS treatment it will keep me ahead of
the depression symptoms – that chronic major

00:08:25.300 --> 00:08:33.180
depressive disorder serves up. I know my symptoms
now, that’s the good news is that I can

00:08:33.180 --> 00:08:41.719
tell when I’m starting to get low. Then
I go for one treatment. Let’s say I go for

00:08:41.719 --> 00:08:46.370
a treatment on a Friday afternoon by Sunday
afternoon I feel the lift. The teariness has

00:08:46.370 --> 00:08:51.700
gone away, the feeling of agitation it dissipates
because my brain has been stimulated and it

00:08:51.700 --> 00:08:54.920
is again reminded its got to do its job.

00:08:54.920 --> 00:09:00.139
&gt;&gt; Sherer: Why is it so important for you
to be an advocate for TMS?

00:09:00.139 --> 00:09:06.540
&gt;&gt; Rhodes: Well for one thing when I did this
in 2010 nobody knew about it. I was one of

00:09:06.540 --> 00:09:14.340
the first patients in the country to try it.
But my remission was so remarkable to me that

00:09:14.340 --> 00:09:19.860
when people would say “Martha you look great,
what are you taking?” I said I’m doing

00:09:19.860 --> 00:09:25.730
TMS, what’s that, nobody knew about it and
to this day there is still not enough critical

00:09:25.730 --> 00:09:34.090
mass for patients to realize that there is
viable, safe, FDA cleared therapy that’s

00:09:34.090 --> 00:09:41.690
an alternative to traditional medications
and other therapies. Again it’s not a cure,

00:09:41.690 --> 00:09:49.450
it’s a tool that doctors now can have as
an ad-in to their tool kit. And patients who

00:09:49.450 --> 00:09:54.140
are not going to respond to mediations, and
there are many of them. Many of us who will

00:09:54.140 --> 00:10:00.270
not respond to medications or become immune
to them over a period of time if you have

00:10:00.270 --> 00:10:04.570
had a lifetime of depression and you’ve
been on medications for that length of time.

00:10:04.570 --> 00:10:09.440
Sometimes you start to build up a resistance
to them which is what I think happened to

00:10:09.440 --> 00:10:20.330
me and so now I have this once a month TMS
treatment. I tell people about, I wrote a

00:10:20.330 --> 00:10:26.170
book about it because I knew that if I could
just get the word out, if I could just let

00:10:26.170 --> 00:10:32.230
people know that there’s hope. There’s
an answer to those that are just struggling

00:10:32.230 --> 00:10:39.860
with not having relief from medication then
it was to me important. So I now advocate,

00:10:39.860 --> 00:10:47.360
spend a lot of time with it. And I have another
theory it’s called do good to feel good.

00:10:47.360 --> 00:10:51.930
For me if I’m helping someone else, if I’m
doing good for someone else, and putting my

00:10:51.930 --> 00:10:59.070
attention over there with you or with another patient, anybody I feel good. That’s part

00:10:59.070 --> 00:11:05.420
of my own therapy for keeping depression,
my depression daemons at bay.

00:11:05.420 --> 00:11:11.440
&gt;&gt; Sherer: Well thanks Martha. Thanks for
coming to Emory and helping explain how TMS

00:11:11.440 --> 00:11:14.620
has changed your life and be well.

00:11:14.620 --> 00:11:18.900
&gt;&gt; Rhodes: Thank you very much for giving
me the opportunity to share my story with

00:11:18.900 --> 00:11:20.030
you. Thank you.
