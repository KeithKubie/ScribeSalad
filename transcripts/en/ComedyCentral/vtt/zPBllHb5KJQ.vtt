Where's that cat I'm not dying
to meet it or anything.

00:00:04.270 --> 00:00:06.339
- Can we wake her up?
- Um...

00:00:06.372 --> 00:00:08.041
- It's a miracle
you haven't already.

00:00:08.074 --> 00:00:10.076
- Jillian.
Hey, Mommy.

00:00:10.109 --> 00:00:11.844 align:end position:100%
- Don't you "Hey, Mommy" me,
Daddy,

00:00:11.877 --> 00:00:13.713 align:end position:100%
barging in here
with these whores

00:00:13.746 --> 00:00:16.182 align:end position:100%
like the beginning
of some crude stag film,

00:00:16.215 --> 00:00:18.184 align:end position:100%
just ten feet away
from where your cat sleeps!

00:00:18.217 --> 00:00:20.086
- Okay.
- Oh, hey, hey!

00:00:20.119 --> 00:00:22.655 align:start position:0%
We heard all about Denny's and
we just wanted to meet her.

00:00:22.688 --> 00:00:24.257
- [mocking accent] Oh, did you?
- Yeah.

00:00:24.290 --> 00:00:25.691 align:end position:100%
- [mocking accent]
Did you hear about Denny's?

00:00:25.724 --> 00:00:27.026 align:end position:100%
[normal voice]
Do you have any cats? No.

00:00:27.059 --> 00:00:29.028
- I--
- No, I didn't think so.

00:00:29.061 --> 00:00:30.596
Because if you did, you
wouldn't be dressed like sluts

00:00:30.629 --> 00:00:32.532
and following home strange men
to pound Mangria.

00:00:32.565 --> 00:00:34.233
Blake, can I see you
in the kitchen for a moment?

00:00:34.266 --> 00:00:36.602
- Mm-hmm, yup.
- We're not strange.

00:00:36.635 --> 00:00:37.904 align:start position:0%
- Yeah,
we're very non-strange.

00:00:37.937 --> 00:00:39.405
- By the way,
we are just minutes away

00:00:39.438 --> 00:00:41.340
from the Mangria, ladies.

00:00:41.373 --> 00:00:43.843 align:start position:0%
- Yeah, so, you know,
we didn't wake her up.

00:00:43.876 --> 00:00:45.511 align:start position:0%
And I didn't think
it was that--

00:00:45.544 --> 00:00:47.580 align:end position:100%
- Yeah, that's right, Blake,
you didn't think.

00:00:47.613 --> 00:00:49.715 align:end position:100%
Denny's was left for dead
in a dumpster,

00:00:49.748 --> 00:00:51.784 align:end position:100%
and you didn't think
that maybe you shouldn't

00:00:51.817 --> 00:00:54.520 align:end position:100%
abandon her on the first night
of being her daddy?

00:00:54.553 --> 00:00:57.223 align:start position:0%
- Hey, I mean,
I just figured, you know,

00:00:57.256 --> 00:00:58.357 size:81% position:41%
you're such a good mommy--

00:00:58.390 --> 00:01:00.026 align:start size:78% position:22%
- Don't you patronize me!

00:01:00.059 --> 00:01:02.028 align:start position:0%
- Okay,
how would I patronize you

00:01:02.061 --> 00:01:04.764 align:start position:0%
when I don't even know
what that means?

00:01:04.797 --> 00:01:07.467 align:start position:0%
Okay?
[stammers]

00:01:07.500 --> 00:01:09.102 size:78% position:39%
What do you want from me?

00:01:09.135 --> 00:01:11.404 align:end position:100%
- I want you to be
a good daddy,

00:01:11.437 --> 00:01:14.140 align:end position:100%
not some whore-mongering
night owl!

00:01:14.173 --> 00:01:16.142 align:start position:0%
- Hey!
All right, at least those...

00:01:16.175 --> 00:01:19.579 align:start position:0%
[softly] whores...
aren't crazy!

00:01:19.612 --> 00:01:21.314 align:start size:72% position:28%
- Oh! Oh, that's right!

00:01:21.347 --> 00:01:23.049
Because I am crazy, right?
- Oh, yeah!

00:01:23.082 --> 00:01:24.550
- Okay, yeah, 'cause I'm crazy.

00:01:24.583 --> 00:01:26.085
You know what?
- Yeah, oh, what you gonna do?

00:01:26.118 --> 00:01:27.453
- I'll show you crazy!
- Oh, yeah!

00:01:27.486 --> 00:01:29.222
- Denny's needs her dad!
- No, no, no!

00:01:29.255 --> 00:01:30.890 align:start position:0%
Throw 'em all over the place,
Jillian!

00:01:30.923 --> 00:01:33.626
- Denny's needs her dad!
- You fricking psycho!

00:01:33.659 --> 00:01:35.995 align:start position:0%
Don't you throw
the nice plastic plates!

00:01:36.028 --> 00:01:37.763 align:end position:100%
- Denny's!
Because she needs one!

00:01:37.796 --> 00:01:40.600 align:start position:0%
- There's one
from Anders's birthday! Okay?

00:01:40.633 --> 00:01:41.901
- Ohh!
- No, let me help ya!

00:01:41.934 --> 00:01:42.902
Let me help ya!
- You want to help me?

00:01:42.935 --> 00:01:44.137 align:start size:38% position:63%
That's fine!

00:01:44.170 --> 00:01:45.671 align:start position:0%
- Just throw 'em
all over the place,

00:01:45.704 --> 00:01:48.608 align:start position:0%
'cause I work
at a goddamned dead-end job!

00:01:48.641 --> 00:01:52.645 size:78% position:39%
I got the shortest straw,
didn't I, when I got you?

00:01:52.678 --> 00:01:54.814 align:start position:0%
You're throwing plates!

00:01:54.847 --> 00:01:57.750
[cat meows]
- She's awake now. Denny's!

00:01:57.783 --> 00:01:59.752
- Oh, come on!
- Denny's!

00:01:59.785 --> 00:02:00.785
- Oh, come on!
