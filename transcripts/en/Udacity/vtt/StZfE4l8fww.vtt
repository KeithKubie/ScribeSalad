00:00:00.210 --> 00:00:04.550
In fact this is a bit of a trick question, because there's no way to know what

00:00:04.550 --> 00:00:11.340
the output will be until we generate a new blue context for the saga function.

00:00:11.340 --> 00:00:14.040
Until we do, there will be no binding for

00:00:14.040 --> 00:00:19.550
a variable deed that's relevant to this last invocation of the sagas call.

00:00:19.550 --> 00:00:23.960
So none of these deeds will be relevant to the final output of this final

00:00:23.960 --> 00:00:25.100
function call.

00:00:25.100 --> 00:00:27.470
Let's see what randomly generated variable it does produce.
