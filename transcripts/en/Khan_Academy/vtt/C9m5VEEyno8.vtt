00:00:00.459 --> 00:00:01.667
- [Voiceover] What I
wanna do in this video

00:00:01.667 --> 00:00:05.126
is figure out multiple
ways to express the area

00:00:05.126 --> 00:00:07.402
of the entire large rectangle,

00:00:07.402 --> 00:00:11.535
which we see is made up of
these six smaller rectangles.

00:00:11.535 --> 00:00:13.369
So there's a couple of
ways that we can do it.

00:00:13.369 --> 00:00:15.104
One way is, we can just
multiply the height

00:00:15.104 --> 00:00:18.942
of this big rectangle times the
width of this big rectangle.

00:00:18.942 --> 00:00:20.242
So what's its height?

00:00:20.242 --> 00:00:22.842
Well, from here to here,

00:00:22.842 --> 00:00:25.420
that distance is going to be y squared,

00:00:25.420 --> 00:00:27.091
and then from there to there,

00:00:27.091 --> 00:00:30.481
that distance is going to be negative 6y.

00:00:30.481 --> 00:00:31.387
And I know what you're thinking.

00:00:31.387 --> 00:00:34.080
How can my distance be negative 6y?

00:00:34.080 --> 00:00:36.379
Isn't a distance always positive?

00:00:36.379 --> 00:00:39.342
Well, even negative 6y can be positive

00:00:39.342 --> 00:00:41.802
if y is negative,

00:00:41.802 --> 00:00:43.020
so it's completely reasonable to say,

00:00:43.020 --> 00:00:45.597
well, this distance could be negative 6y.

00:00:45.597 --> 00:00:49.621
So the entire height right
over here is going to be,

00:00:49.621 --> 00:00:53.986
it's going to be y squared minus 6y.

00:00:53.986 --> 00:00:57.540
Or you could do it as y
squared plus this distance,

00:00:57.540 --> 00:01:00.976
which is negative 6y, y
squared plus negative 6y,

00:01:00.976 --> 00:01:03.959
which is the same thing
as y squared minus 6y.

00:01:03.959 --> 00:01:06.705
So that's the height
of this big rectangle.

00:01:06.705 --> 00:01:08.726
What's its width?

00:01:08.726 --> 00:01:11.813
Well, the width is going to be the width

00:01:11.813 --> 00:01:16.410
of this purple rectangle,
it's going to be 3y squared,

00:01:16.410 --> 00:01:19.498
plus the width of this yellow rectangle,

00:01:19.498 --> 00:01:22.795
which is negative 2y, and that
can have a negative out here,

00:01:22.795 --> 00:01:24.769
the same logic why this
could have a negative,

00:01:24.769 --> 00:01:26.812
why the negative 6y could have a negative,

00:01:26.812 --> 00:01:29.437
and then plus the width

00:01:29.437 --> 00:01:31.847
of the blue rectangle.

00:01:31.847 --> 00:01:33.454
And so if you add them all together,

00:01:33.454 --> 00:01:36.476
the width of the entire rectangle is going

00:01:36.476 --> 00:01:41.394
to be 3y squared minus 2y,

00:01:41.394 --> 00:01:43.848
minus 2y plus one.

00:01:44.738 --> 00:01:47.594
And just like that, this
expression that I just wrote down

00:01:47.594 --> 00:01:51.401
will give us the area for the entire,

00:01:51.401 --> 00:01:54.884
the area for the entire big rectangle.

00:01:54.884 --> 00:01:56.138
Now, there's another way to do it,

00:01:56.138 --> 00:01:59.366
and a big clue was that we
subdivided the big rectangle

00:01:59.366 --> 00:02:01.595
into these six smaller rectangles,

00:02:01.595 --> 00:02:04.311
and we have the dimensions for
the six smaller rectangles.

00:02:04.311 --> 00:02:06.006
And so we could find the
area for each of these,

00:02:06.006 --> 00:02:08.167
and then we could add them all together.

00:02:08.167 --> 00:02:09.629
So let's look at this first one.

00:02:09.629 --> 00:02:10.837
Height times width.

00:02:10.837 --> 00:02:13.297
The area of this purple
rectangle is gonna be the height,

00:02:13.297 --> 00:02:16.245
y squared, times the width,

00:02:16.245 --> 00:02:18.605
which is 3y squared,

00:02:18.605 --> 00:02:21.447
which is going to be equal
to, it's gonna be three,

00:02:21.447 --> 00:02:25.859
and then y squared times y
squared is y to the fourth power.

00:02:25.859 --> 00:02:27.275
What's the area of this yellow rectangle?

00:02:27.275 --> 00:02:28.877
Height is y squared.

00:02:28.877 --> 00:02:31.223
It's going to be y
squared times the width,

00:02:31.223 --> 00:02:33.359
times negative 2y,

00:02:33.359 --> 00:02:37.886
which is going to give us
negative 2y to the third power.

00:02:37.886 --> 00:02:39.117
What about the blue one?

00:02:39.117 --> 00:02:42.949
Well, height times width, it's
gonna be y squared times one,

00:02:42.949 --> 00:02:46.338
which, of course, is just
going to be equal to y squared.

00:02:46.338 --> 00:02:48.474
Now, this green one,
it's gonna be the height,

00:02:48.474 --> 00:02:52.746
which is now negative 6y, times the width,

00:02:52.746 --> 00:02:57.274
which is 3y squared, which
is going to be equal to,

00:02:57.274 --> 00:03:01.012
let's see, negative six
times three is negative 18,

00:03:01.012 --> 00:03:05.656
and then y times y squared
is y to the third power.

00:03:05.656 --> 00:03:08.977
Now, the area of this gray
rectangle is gonna be the height,

00:03:08.977 --> 00:03:12.869
which is negative 6y, times the width,

00:03:12.869 --> 00:03:15.818
which is negative 2y,

00:03:15.818 --> 00:03:18.488
which gets us negative
six times negative two

00:03:18.488 --> 00:03:20.225
is positive 12,

00:03:20.225 --> 00:03:23.755
y times y is y squared.

00:03:23.755 --> 00:03:26.591
And then finally the area of
this rectangle right over here,

00:03:26.591 --> 00:03:30.259
it's gonna be the height,
which is negative 6y,

00:03:30.259 --> 00:03:32.907
times the width, which is just one,

00:03:32.907 --> 00:03:35.995
which is equal to negative 6y.

00:03:35.995 --> 00:03:38.410
And so if we want the area
of this entire rectangle,

00:03:38.410 --> 00:03:41.034
we can just add up the
areas of the smaller ones,

00:03:41.034 --> 00:03:44.401
so it's going to be equal to the three,

00:03:44.401 --> 00:03:47.976
it's going to be equal
to the 3y to the fourth,

00:03:47.976 --> 00:03:51.272
3y to the fourth,

00:03:51.272 --> 00:03:55.406
plus negative 2y to the third power.

00:03:55.406 --> 00:03:59.307
Let me write this in a color
that corresponds to that.

00:03:59.307 --> 00:04:03.278
Negative 2y to the third power,

00:04:03.278 --> 00:04:05.234
plus y squared,

00:04:06.644 --> 00:04:10.801
plus y squared,

00:04:10.801 --> 00:04:14.259
minus 18y to the third power,

00:04:14.259 --> 00:04:18.765
so minus 18y to the third power,

00:04:18.765 --> 00:04:21.783
plus 12y squared.

00:04:21.783 --> 00:04:23.362
Let's write that in black.

00:04:23.362 --> 00:04:26.404
So plus 12y squared,

00:04:26.404 --> 00:04:30.607
and then last but not
least, we have the minus 6y,

00:04:30.607 --> 00:04:32.302
minus 6y.

00:04:32.302 --> 00:04:35.134
So this is an expression for
the area of the entire thing,

00:04:35.134 --> 00:04:36.946
but we can simplify it more.

00:04:36.946 --> 00:04:40.800
So let's see, we only have
one fourth degree term,

00:04:40.800 --> 00:04:42.843
so I'll just rewrite that.

00:04:42.843 --> 00:04:47.719
So we have one fourth degree term,

00:04:47.719 --> 00:04:48.740
so I'll just rewrite that.

00:04:48.740 --> 00:04:50.877
3y to the fourth power.

00:04:50.877 --> 00:04:53.500
Now, how many third
degree terms do we have?

00:04:53.500 --> 00:04:57.309
We have negative 2y to the third power.

00:04:57.309 --> 00:05:00.676
We have negative 18y to the third power.

00:05:00.676 --> 00:05:01.953
So if we add these two together,

00:05:01.953 --> 00:05:03.671
how many y to the third powers do we have?

00:05:03.671 --> 00:05:06.782
Well, negative two plus
negative 18 is negative 20,

00:05:06.782 --> 00:05:10.438
negative 20y to the third power.

00:05:10.438 --> 00:05:13.913
And then how many second
degree terms do we have?

00:05:13.913 --> 00:05:16.117
Well, we have one y
squared right over here,

00:05:16.117 --> 00:05:18.253
and then we have another, 12y squareds.

00:05:18.253 --> 00:05:22.804
You add those together, you're
gonna have 13y squareds.

00:05:22.804 --> 00:05:27.703
And then finally we still
need to subtract the 6y.

00:05:27.703 --> 00:05:28.841
And there you have it,

00:05:28.841 --> 00:05:32.835
another expression for the
area of the entire rectangle.

00:05:32.835 --> 00:05:34.716
And the whole point of
doing this is to realize

00:05:34.716 --> 00:05:38.083
that this up here and this
down here are equivalent,

00:05:38.083 --> 00:05:41.147
and that the way that we multiply
this actually corresponds

00:05:41.147 --> 00:05:42.912
to exactly how we found the areas

00:05:42.912 --> 00:05:45.234
of the smaller rectangles right over here.

00:05:45.234 --> 00:05:48.601
You would say y squared times
3y squared is 3y fourth.

00:05:48.601 --> 00:05:51.085
Y squared times negative 2y is negative 2y

00:05:51.085 --> 00:05:52.153
to the third power.

00:05:52.153 --> 00:05:56.681
Y squared times one is y squared,

00:05:56.681 --> 00:05:58.840
which is exactly what we
did when we found the area

00:05:58.840 --> 00:06:00.984
of these rectangles in
this, I guess you could say,

00:06:00.984 --> 00:06:02.114
in this top row.

00:06:02.114 --> 00:06:03.716
And then you would take the negative six,

00:06:03.716 --> 00:06:07.153
and you would say negative
six times 3y squared

00:06:07.153 --> 00:06:09.149
is negative 18y to the third.

00:06:09.149 --> 00:06:13.190
Negative six times negative
2y is positive 12y squared.

00:06:13.190 --> 00:06:17.313
Negative 6y times one

00:06:17.313 --> 00:06:19.903
is negative 6y.

00:06:19.903 --> 00:06:21.726
And just to realize that
this isn't just some type

00:06:21.726 --> 00:06:22.707
of voodoo that we're doing.

00:06:22.707 --> 00:06:24.821
It completely makes sense
when you think about

00:06:24.821 --> 00:06:27.753
in terms of an area model like this.
