00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.730
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:00:05.010 --> 00:00:07.150
- Good afternoon, everybody.

00:00:07.150 --> 00:00:08.160
I'm Jane Kamensky.

00:00:08.160 --> 00:00:10.490
I'm the director of the
Schlesinger Library.

00:00:10.490 --> 00:00:13.650
I want to welcome you on behalf
of the Radcliffe Institute

00:00:13.650 --> 00:00:17.150
and Schlesinger, one
of its major programs,

00:00:17.150 --> 00:00:21.960
on this, the first big
public event of Schlesinger's

00:00:21.960 --> 00:00:23.670
75th anniversary year.

00:00:23.670 --> 00:00:26.900
So we've actually invited
you to a birthday party

00:00:26.900 --> 00:00:32.250
and there will be plenty of food
at the reception afterwards.

00:00:32.250 --> 00:00:35.010
We're taking in this
75th anniversary

00:00:35.010 --> 00:00:39.870
year a year-long look
back at our origins,

00:00:39.870 --> 00:00:46.200
at the journey we've taken since
1943, at how far we've come,

00:00:46.200 --> 00:00:49.380
and especially taking
stock and thinking

00:00:49.380 --> 00:00:53.280
about new directions in future.

00:00:53.280 --> 00:00:56.820
Calling the year 2018
our 75th anniversary

00:00:56.820 --> 00:01:00.000
actually looks to
Schlesinger Library's second

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:02.070
of three foundings.

00:01:02.070 --> 00:01:04.690
The first was the
collection that

00:01:04.690 --> 00:01:08.550
served what was initially called
the Harvard Annex and then

00:01:08.550 --> 00:01:12.040
later Radcliffe College
in the late 19th century.

00:01:12.040 --> 00:01:15.720
But the anniversary we're
celebrating this year,

00:01:15.720 --> 00:01:19.710
dating to 1943 in the middle
of the Second World War

00:01:19.710 --> 00:01:25.020
some 23 years after American
women won the right to vote,

00:01:25.020 --> 00:01:28.455
was the moment when the
Radcliffe alumna Maude Wood

00:01:28.455 --> 00:01:32.610
Park, class of '98,
donated a large collection

00:01:32.610 --> 00:01:35.520
of suffrage-related
material to create

00:01:35.520 --> 00:01:38.520
what was called the Woman's
Rights Collection at Radcliffe

00:01:38.520 --> 00:01:39.690
College.

00:01:39.690 --> 00:01:42.640
This was a big
collection for its time.

00:01:42.640 --> 00:01:45.690
It included 30 cartons
of manuscripts,

00:01:45.690 --> 00:01:48.810
more than 300 books
and periodicals,

00:01:48.810 --> 00:01:53.160
some assorted objects,
including possibly the suffrage

00:01:53.160 --> 00:01:56.700
wagon that our photographs
show pulling up

00:01:56.700 --> 00:02:01.380
to Longfellow Hall on Women's
Equality Day, August 26,

00:02:01.380 --> 00:02:03.960
of 1943.

00:02:03.960 --> 00:02:06.810
That's the anniversary of the
passage of the 19th Amendment

00:02:06.810 --> 00:02:08.580
through the final state.

00:02:08.580 --> 00:02:11.580
The Woman's Rights
Collection was that year

00:02:11.580 --> 00:02:14.620
given a proverbial
room of its own,

00:02:14.620 --> 00:02:17.940
which was a small padlocked
space in Longfellow Hall

00:02:17.940 --> 00:02:21.530
now part of Harvard's
Graduate School of Education.

00:02:21.530 --> 00:02:24.450
The first year for
which we have records

00:02:24.450 --> 00:02:27.150
of the use of the
Women's Rights Collection

00:02:27.150 --> 00:02:32.610
is 1949 and seven researchers
used it that year.

00:02:32.610 --> 00:02:35.910
So here we are, 7 and
1/2 decades later.

00:02:35.910 --> 00:02:39.660
Schlesinger houses more than
4,000 manuscript collections

00:02:39.660 --> 00:02:43.800
and 130,000 books-- a number
that grows every day--

00:02:43.800 --> 00:02:47.370
enough to fill three
capacious vaults on site

00:02:47.370 --> 00:02:51.270
and much more in Harvard's
remote depository.

00:02:51.270 --> 00:02:54.540
We are a vibrant living
library, building

00:02:54.540 --> 00:02:57.360
on strengths like the
June Jordan collection

00:02:57.360 --> 00:03:02.010
that came to us 15 years ago and
provides the genesis of today's

00:03:02.010 --> 00:03:04.410
event, and building
on those strengths

00:03:04.410 --> 00:03:07.650
to strike out in
complementary directions

00:03:07.650 --> 00:03:10.710
as well as to break new ground.

00:03:10.710 --> 00:03:13.830
We will break new
ground literally

00:03:13.830 --> 00:03:15.930
at the end of this
anniversary year, late

00:03:15.930 --> 00:03:19.290
next fall, when we thoroughly
renovate our main building

00:03:19.290 --> 00:03:23.250
to improve our public
learning and work spaces.

00:03:23.250 --> 00:03:25.980
And we break new
ground intellectually

00:03:25.980 --> 00:03:28.500
with acquisitions,
like one you might

00:03:28.500 --> 00:03:32.055
have read about last week,
the papers of Angela Davis.

00:03:32.055 --> 00:03:33.406
[APPLAUSE]

00:03:37.310 --> 00:03:41.080
Our work in the library is
meticulous and detailed,

00:03:41.080 --> 00:03:43.580
so just to give you
a sense of scale,

00:03:43.580 --> 00:03:47.200
the Angela Davis papers
are over 150 cartons--

00:03:47.200 --> 00:03:50.800
nearly half the size of that
whole founding collection--

00:03:50.800 --> 00:03:56.890
and it'll take nearly two
years of full-time staff work

00:03:56.890 --> 00:04:00.580
to sort, describe,
preserve, stabilize,

00:04:00.580 --> 00:04:04.270
and ready Angela Davis'
papers for researchers.

00:04:04.270 --> 00:04:07.690
Our work, in other words,
is staff-intensive.

00:04:07.690 --> 00:04:10.750
The depth of training that
our curators, archivists,

00:04:10.750 --> 00:04:14.380
processors, staff leaders,
and reference librarians

00:04:14.380 --> 00:04:18.279
have is known throughout
the industry and is,

00:04:18.279 --> 00:04:19.959
among other things,
I think, one of

00:04:19.959 --> 00:04:23.800
our key competitive
advantages in the world

00:04:23.800 --> 00:04:25.250
of special collections.

00:04:25.250 --> 00:04:27.250
There are a lot of
Schlesinger staff here today,

00:04:27.250 --> 00:04:29.625
and if I could ask that you
would stand up so that we can

00:04:29.625 --> 00:04:31.438
applaud what you do, please.

00:04:31.438 --> 00:04:32.905
[APPLAUSE]

00:04:40.730 --> 00:04:44.690
Our work is also
expensive and many of you

00:04:44.690 --> 00:04:48.530
here today number among
our supporters, for which I

00:04:48.530 --> 00:04:50.570
want to applaud you.

00:04:50.570 --> 00:04:51.257
Thank you.

00:04:51.257 --> 00:04:52.171
[APPLAUSE]

00:04:54.460 --> 00:04:57.160
The acquisition of the
Angela Davis papers

00:04:57.160 --> 00:05:08.200
is important not only because
of Davis' iconic qualities

00:05:08.200 --> 00:05:11.470
but also because of the ways
that they reflect the library's

00:05:11.470 --> 00:05:14.440
strategic priorities
to diversify

00:05:14.440 --> 00:05:16.840
the collections by
race and ethnicity

00:05:16.840 --> 00:05:20.740
and also by ideology and
political commitments,

00:05:20.740 --> 00:05:24.250
with Angela being one of
the people who has broken

00:05:24.250 --> 00:05:27.850
new ground intellectually and
politically and in her activism

00:05:27.850 --> 00:05:31.660
and move the rest of
the world forward.

00:05:31.660 --> 00:05:35.920
Before I turn over the
introduction to today's event

00:05:35.920 --> 00:05:40.090
to my colleague, Kenvi Phillips,
Schlesinger's inaugural curator

00:05:40.090 --> 00:05:43.300
for race and ethnicity,
let me call your attention

00:05:43.300 --> 00:05:45.460
to a couple of other
upcoming events

00:05:45.460 --> 00:05:47.770
that connect with
our anniversary year

00:05:47.770 --> 00:05:49.870
and with the Radcliffe
Institute's broader

00:05:49.870 --> 00:05:53.980
commitment to support the study
of women, gender, and society.

00:05:53.980 --> 00:05:55.810
So on the back
table, you will see

00:05:55.810 --> 00:05:57.460
a card that looks like this.

00:05:57.460 --> 00:06:01.180
It's for our 75th anniversary
exhibit in Schlesinger's lobby

00:06:01.180 --> 00:06:06.370
gallery, 75 Objects Telling
75 Stories About 75 Years.

00:06:06.370 --> 00:06:08.110
You'll also see
a card that looks

00:06:08.110 --> 00:06:12.280
like this that shows you all
of our Schlesinger events

00:06:12.280 --> 00:06:15.310
for this anniversary year,
except for one that we

00:06:15.310 --> 00:06:18.070
scrambled together so
quickly that it didn't make

00:06:18.070 --> 00:06:21.250
the card, which is an event this
coming Monday night called Me

00:06:21.250 --> 00:06:24.910
Too: Truths and Consequences
that Brings Harvard Faculty

00:06:24.910 --> 00:06:30.760
Expertise to Bear on this
Fast-Moving Hot-Button Moment

00:06:30.760 --> 00:06:32.410
and Movement.

00:06:32.410 --> 00:06:36.940
Later, in the spring, on
April 5th and 6th, a Thursday

00:06:36.940 --> 00:06:39.610
and a Friday, will be
our annual Radcliffe

00:06:39.610 --> 00:06:42.220
Institute Gender
Conference, this year

00:06:42.220 --> 00:06:45.640
in connection with the
Institute's citizenship year.

00:06:45.640 --> 00:06:49.150
Its title is Who Belongs:
Global Citizenship and Gender

00:06:49.150 --> 00:06:52.930
in the 21st Century, to which
I think June Jordan would

00:06:52.930 --> 00:06:54.650
have wanted to go.

00:06:54.650 --> 00:06:56.690
So with that, I will
turn it over to Kenvi

00:06:56.690 --> 00:06:58.510
and welcome you to
the celebration.

00:06:58.510 --> 00:06:59.292
Thank you.

00:06:59.292 --> 00:07:01.220
[APPLAUSE]

00:07:08.450 --> 00:07:10.560
- I don't-- good evening,
morning, afternoon.

00:07:10.560 --> 00:07:12.847
I don't know what
this time of day is.

00:07:12.847 --> 00:07:14.180
As Jane said-- thank you, Jane--

00:07:14.180 --> 00:07:15.013
I am Kenvi Phillips.

00:07:15.013 --> 00:07:17.870
I am the curator for race and
ethnicity at the Schlesinger

00:07:17.870 --> 00:07:20.900
Library here and I
want to welcome you

00:07:20.900 --> 00:07:24.110
to this wonderful evening
that we're about to have--

00:07:24.110 --> 00:07:27.007
evening full of poetry,
commentary, and conversation

00:07:27.007 --> 00:07:29.090
that we've planned for you
to celebrate the living

00:07:29.090 --> 00:07:30.582
legacy of June Jordan.

00:07:30.582 --> 00:07:32.540
And there are lots of
things that I need to do,

00:07:32.540 --> 00:07:33.530
so please bear with me.

00:07:33.530 --> 00:07:35.030
There are several
people that I want

00:07:35.030 --> 00:07:38.120
to acknowledge who were
very instrumental in making

00:07:38.120 --> 00:07:39.800
this day happen for us.

00:07:39.800 --> 00:07:43.190
And chiefly and first
is Dr. Joshua Bennett,

00:07:43.190 --> 00:07:46.830
who I will give you a full
bio when the panelists come up

00:07:46.830 --> 00:07:50.120
as he will be moderating the
first portion of the evening.

00:07:50.120 --> 00:07:53.330
Joshua led, Alicia
followed, Jane Kamensky

00:07:53.330 --> 00:07:55.867
was a strong member
of the committee that

00:07:55.867 --> 00:07:57.700
organized this panel,
and then, of course, I

00:07:57.700 --> 00:07:59.430
sat there with them.

00:07:59.430 --> 00:08:02.690
Before our panelists today,
I'm going to introduce you

00:08:02.690 --> 00:08:03.840
all in no particular order.

00:08:03.840 --> 00:08:05.339
I don't know if you
want to come up?

00:08:05.339 --> 00:08:08.345
Yeah, come on up, because I
want to get out of the way

00:08:08.345 --> 00:08:12.290
so we can start
this conversation.

00:08:12.290 --> 00:08:16.040
I'll start with who's first,
which is Imani Perry, who

numerous other titles and one

00:08:37.830 --> 00:08:40.159

recently published

00:08:40.159 --> 00:08:44.840
about centering around The Negro
National Anthem, Lift Every

00:08:44.840 --> 00:08:47.360
Voice and Sing, which she told
me is really exciting so I

00:08:47.360 --> 00:08:49.700
can't wait to read it.

00:08:49.700 --> 00:08:53.750

00:09:55.660 --> 00:09:58.960
of man, which is forthcoming.

at Columbia University.

00:10:11.610 --> 00:10:13.360
And this, I should
say, is the second part

00:10:13.360 --> 00:10:16.630
of a two-part program
that Joshua largely

00:10:16.630 --> 00:10:21.480
put together, where we're
celebrating June Jordan's

00:10:21.480 --> 00:10:21.980
legacy.

00:10:21.980 --> 00:10:25.310
And the first part happened
this fall at Columbia University

00:10:25.310 --> 00:10:27.860
and it was an absolutely
wonderful conversation

00:10:27.860 --> 00:10:30.350
between local poets,
activists, and scholars, much

00:10:30.350 --> 00:10:33.120
like what we'll have tonight.

00:10:33.120 --> 00:10:33.620
Today.

00:10:35.722 --> 00:10:37.430
Now that we've done
that, now that you've

00:10:37.430 --> 00:10:39.800
met everybody in the room,
let's meet the big person that's

00:10:39.800 --> 00:10:40.300
in the room.

00:10:40.300 --> 00:10:42.544
And I'm sure you
all know her and I'm

00:10:42.544 --> 00:10:44.210
sure you all are very
familiar with her,

00:10:44.210 --> 00:10:45.830
because in her
writing, she definitely

00:10:45.830 --> 00:10:48.440
revealed who she was
to us all, but we

00:10:48.440 --> 00:10:54.060
have to talk about the woman
who we are here to celebrate,

00:10:54.060 --> 00:10:55.490
June Jordan.

00:10:55.490 --> 00:10:58.610
The daughter of Jamaican-born
Mildred and Granville Jordan,

00:10:58.610 --> 00:11:02.300
she was born in 1936 in
Harlem and died in 2002

00:11:02.300 --> 00:11:04.520
in Berkeley, California.

00:11:04.520 --> 00:11:08.930
In the 65 transformative
years between those two years,

00:11:08.930 --> 00:11:10.820
she published nearly
30 books of poems,

00:11:10.820 --> 00:11:13.160
children's literature,
political essays,

00:11:13.160 --> 00:11:15.260
wrote a column for the
progressive, taught

00:11:15.260 --> 00:11:18.450
at several universities,
including Yale and UC Berkeley,

00:11:18.450 --> 00:11:22.970
which is where she established
the arts and activism, Poetry

00:11:22.970 --> 00:11:26.050
for the People program in 1991.

00:11:26.050 --> 00:11:29.370
An activist, she was engaged in
the struggles for civil rights,

00:11:29.370 --> 00:11:33.110
women's rights, sexual freedom,
and against militarization,

00:11:33.110 --> 00:11:36.860
police brutality, among the
many things she discussed.

00:11:36.860 --> 00:11:39.980
She married, she divorced,
she loved, she had a son,

00:11:39.980 --> 00:11:41.540
and she lived.

00:11:41.540 --> 00:11:43.910
She observed the world
around her and wrote about it

00:11:43.910 --> 00:11:46.880
and worked to improve it, not
simply for herself, but for all

00:11:46.880 --> 00:11:47.840
of us.

00:11:47.840 --> 00:11:49.580
She used her language
to give voice

00:11:49.580 --> 00:11:52.380
to those who could not
speak for themselves.

00:11:52.380 --> 00:11:54.140
And while she befriended
literary giants,

00:11:54.140 --> 00:11:56.180
like Toni Morrison
and Pat Parker

00:11:56.180 --> 00:11:58.280
and Alice Walker
and Adrian Rich,

00:11:58.280 --> 00:12:00.200
she worked for the community.

00:12:00.200 --> 00:12:02.660
And in the tradition of
poets and writers before her,

00:12:02.660 --> 00:12:04.610
like Langston Hughes
and Zora Neale Hurston,

00:12:04.610 --> 00:12:07.550
she elevated the use
of nonstandard English

00:12:07.550 --> 00:12:10.970
and advocated for
self-awareness and acknowledging

00:12:10.970 --> 00:12:14.660
her whole self and wanting you
to acknowledge your whole self.

00:12:14.660 --> 00:12:17.960
Jordan refused to deny any
part of her life or experience,

00:12:17.960 --> 00:12:20.780
not even to publish, and I
know the writers in the room

00:12:20.780 --> 00:12:22.580
are like, yeah,
publishing is important,

00:12:22.580 --> 00:12:26.030
but you need your whole self
and she definitely lived that.

00:12:26.030 --> 00:12:28.460
Her words were
eloquent and urgent

00:12:28.460 --> 00:12:30.950
and timeless and
relevant and funny

00:12:30.950 --> 00:12:33.710
and sad and scathing
and comforting

00:12:33.710 --> 00:12:37.460
and I encourage you
to go read her work.

00:12:37.460 --> 00:12:39.330
Her work is widely available.

00:12:39.330 --> 00:12:42.160
She's one of the most
widely-read prolific

00:12:42.160 --> 00:12:44.810
and published
writers that has ever

00:12:44.810 --> 00:12:46.670
graced us with her presence.

00:12:46.670 --> 00:12:50.150
And also, her archives are
right next door in the library.

00:12:50.150 --> 00:12:51.350
They're open.

00:12:51.350 --> 00:12:55.370
We open six days a week, so.

00:12:55.370 --> 00:12:59.240
She has this
beautifully-written essay,

00:12:59.240 --> 00:13:04.050
if you don't read anything else,
"The Difficult Miracle of Black

00:13:04.050 --> 00:13:10.440
Poetry in America," and
in that essay/sonnet,

00:13:10.440 --> 00:13:13.140
she says quite a few
things that are absolutely

00:13:13.140 --> 00:13:16.590
transformative, I found, but
among them, she sums it up

00:13:16.590 --> 00:13:19.740
to say, "This is the difficult
miracle of black poetry

00:13:19.740 --> 00:13:22.620
in America, that we persist.

00:13:22.620 --> 00:13:27.840
Published or not and loved
or unloved, we persist."

00:13:27.840 --> 00:13:30.210
So we are here
today to talk about,

00:13:30.210 --> 00:13:32.250
to celebrate and to
continue on the legacy

00:13:32.250 --> 00:13:33.930
of this wonderful,
wonderful woman.

00:13:33.930 --> 00:13:35.820
This wonderful,
wonderful thinker.

00:13:35.820 --> 00:13:37.890
To celebrate the
life and the works

00:13:37.890 --> 00:13:40.920
of the poet, the activist,
the journalist, the scholar,

00:13:40.920 --> 00:13:44.820
the essayist, the biographer
and novelist, librettist,

00:13:44.820 --> 00:13:47.750
political visionary, daughter,
mother, friend, lover,

00:13:47.750 --> 00:13:52.200
radical humanist, and still
persistent black woman, June

00:13:52.200 --> 00:13:53.013
Jordan.

00:13:53.013 --> 00:13:54.945
[APPLAUSE]

00:14:03.660 --> 00:14:05.750
- My God.

00:14:05.750 --> 00:14:07.000
What else is there to be said?

00:14:07.000 --> 00:14:09.130
How are you all
doing this evening?

00:14:09.130 --> 00:14:12.430
OK, we got the right
energy going already early.

00:14:12.430 --> 00:14:15.400
Thank you so much, Kenvi, for
that beautiful introduction

00:14:15.400 --> 00:14:16.000
to the event.

00:14:16.000 --> 00:14:17.666
If we could actually
have one more round

00:14:17.666 --> 00:14:19.187
of applause for Kenvi Phillips

00:14:19.187 --> 00:14:20.618
[APPLAUSE]

00:14:25.450 --> 00:14:28.900
The June Jordan fellowship
began as a dream in my mind

00:14:28.900 --> 00:14:29.710
as a teenager.

00:14:29.710 --> 00:14:32.380
The idea that we could
create a series of events

00:14:32.380 --> 00:14:34.150
where young people
could come together,

00:14:34.150 --> 00:14:37.330
whether they were incarcerated
or not, and create art.

00:14:37.330 --> 00:14:40.150
And so to see this event
here, with luminaries

00:14:40.150 --> 00:14:42.880
that I have studied and
worked alongside for so much

00:14:42.880 --> 00:14:45.070
of the past, you know,
seven or eight years,

00:14:45.070 --> 00:14:45.971
means a great deal.

00:14:45.971 --> 00:14:47.470
So we're going to
jump right into it

00:14:47.470 --> 00:14:49.270
and we're going to
decrease so the spirit can

00:14:49.270 --> 00:14:51.520
increase because that's the
tradition I was raised in.

00:14:51.520 --> 00:14:53.440
So we'll begin
with Solmaz Sharif.

00:14:57.630 --> 00:15:02.480
- So I'm going to read a
short-ish talk on June,

00:15:02.480 --> 00:15:03.995
written as a series of lessons.

00:15:06.700 --> 00:15:09.060
"One.

00:15:09.060 --> 00:15:12.320
I never actually
met June Jordan.

00:15:12.320 --> 00:15:15.200
She stood once in the
fall of 2001, shortly

00:15:15.200 --> 00:15:17.690
after 9/11, in the
beginning of my first year

00:15:17.690 --> 00:15:20.960
at UC Berkeley on the
steps of Sproul Plaza,

00:15:20.960 --> 00:15:22.790
reading something
into a microphone.

00:15:22.790 --> 00:15:23.870
I was late to class.

00:15:23.870 --> 00:15:25.970
I would see her
later, I thought.

00:15:25.970 --> 00:15:28.310
She died before I could.

00:15:28.310 --> 00:15:31.114
This was her first lesson.

00:15:31.114 --> 00:15:32.990
Two.

00:15:32.990 --> 00:15:34.940
This is incorrect.

00:15:34.940 --> 00:15:37.940
Her first lesson to me was
in the Borders bookstore

00:15:37.940 --> 00:15:41.570
on Westwood Boulevard, which
was the one place I could go

00:15:41.570 --> 00:15:44.030
as a teen without explanation.

00:15:44.030 --> 00:15:47.150
The one place my parents would
allow me to stay undisturbed

00:15:47.150 --> 00:15:48.710
until closing.

00:15:48.710 --> 00:15:50.600
There was an anthology
of love poetry

00:15:50.600 --> 00:15:52.490
that I haven't been
able to find since.

00:15:52.490 --> 00:15:55.730
In it, a poem by her
called 'Taiko Dojo,

00:15:55.730 --> 00:15:57.860
Messages from Haruko.'

00:15:57.860 --> 00:16:02.780
The poem is the word
'no' repeated 65 times

00:16:02.780 --> 00:16:04.970
with varying punctuation.

00:16:04.970 --> 00:16:06.724
I hadn't heard
Taiko drums before

00:16:06.724 --> 00:16:08.390
and I didn't know I
was supposed to read

00:16:08.390 --> 00:16:12.080
the poem, its exclamations
and hyphens, as percussion.

00:16:12.080 --> 00:16:13.850
Someone was not
happy, I could tell,

00:16:13.850 --> 00:16:15.470
but otherwise, I was troubled.

00:16:15.470 --> 00:16:16.970
Annoyed, even.

00:16:16.970 --> 00:16:18.140
Was this a poem?

00:16:18.140 --> 00:16:19.760
One word again and again.

00:16:19.760 --> 00:16:21.720
How was it enough?

00:16:21.720 --> 00:16:24.000
I remember that poem
clearly, though,

00:16:24.000 --> 00:16:27.030
and forget every other
one in that anthology,

00:16:27.030 --> 00:16:30.690
including one by Octavio
Paz I found moving

00:16:30.690 --> 00:16:34.800
enough to copy for a crush.

00:16:34.800 --> 00:16:37.600
In her memoir,
Soldier, she writes,

00:16:37.600 --> 00:16:42.280
quote, 'Nobody bothered me
when I was reading except

00:16:42.280 --> 00:16:45.010
to make me eat or go to bed.

00:16:45.010 --> 00:16:47.380
It was peaceful to
read, and sometimes, I

00:16:47.380 --> 00:16:49.360
could feel the words
kissing my face.

00:16:49.360 --> 00:16:51.910
I would put my nose
close to the page,

00:16:51.910 --> 00:16:53.980
and because no one
was watching me,

00:16:53.980 --> 00:16:57.070
sometimes I would just trip a
word from the page to my eye

00:16:57.070 --> 00:16:58.740
to my ear to the page--

00:16:58.740 --> 00:17:02.900
the, the, the, the.

00:17:02.900 --> 00:17:03.980
So funny, I thought.

00:17:03.980 --> 00:17:07.250
Such a soft, funny thing,
showing up again and again.

00:17:07.250 --> 00:17:08.022
The.

00:17:08.022 --> 00:17:10.450
The.'

00:17:10.450 --> 00:17:13.599
And then, in her
posthumously-published poem,

00:17:13.599 --> 00:17:16.990
'Thoughts of a Teenage African
Girl Standing on the Auction

00:17:16.990 --> 00:17:29.305
Block,' June writes, 'the,
that, no, that, that, no,

00:17:29.305 --> 00:17:43.660
the, mother, mother, that, the,
no tree, water, dirty, dirty,

00:17:43.660 --> 00:17:51.860
no air, no, hurt me,
hurt me, no, no, no.'

00:17:56.827 --> 00:17:57.327
Three.

00:18:00.810 --> 00:18:05.470
A poem was a sight of pleasure
nowhere else in language.

00:18:05.470 --> 00:18:07.870
A poem was the pleasure
available to us

00:18:07.870 --> 00:18:11.020
in language at all
times, though denied.

00:18:11.020 --> 00:18:12.550
Any violence against
that pleasure

00:18:12.550 --> 00:18:15.670
would be thrown into
sharp relief in the poem.

00:18:15.670 --> 00:18:19.840
The, that, no, that.

00:18:19.840 --> 00:18:22.840
History could be
interrogated by article.

00:18:22.840 --> 00:18:24.070
By preposition.

00:18:24.070 --> 00:18:25.420
A word was a note.

00:18:25.420 --> 00:18:28.060
She was a classically
trained pianist, after all.

00:18:28.060 --> 00:18:31.790
A librettist, an urban planner,
a teacher, an activist,

00:18:31.790 --> 00:18:32.590
a mother.

00:18:32.590 --> 00:18:34.750
All were present in every poem.

00:18:34.750 --> 00:18:36.940
A poem was irritating,
even, because it

00:18:36.940 --> 00:18:39.190
was embarrassing
to be moved, to be

00:18:39.190 --> 00:18:43.030
pleased, so without being
able to explain why,

00:18:43.030 --> 00:18:46.030
to be pleased in public
in my own privacy,

00:18:46.030 --> 00:18:47.890
this was perhaps her
first lesson to me,

00:18:47.890 --> 00:18:50.348
though I've lost track.

00:18:50.348 --> 00:18:50.848
Four.

00:18:55.150 --> 00:18:58.890
Pleasure is not a word used
too often by certain critics

00:18:58.890 --> 00:19:02.070
when they talk of June,
rarely as they do,

00:19:02.070 --> 00:19:05.280
nor is desired, though, as her
posthumous collection tells us,

00:19:05.280 --> 00:19:06.990
she is directed by it.

00:19:06.990 --> 00:19:10.290
'She is,' Alice Walker writes,
'among the bravest of us,

00:19:10.290 --> 00:19:11.790
the most outraged.

00:19:11.790 --> 00:19:14.160
And that word,
'rage,' follows her.

00:19:14.160 --> 00:19:17.580
Take, for example, this last
review The New York Times ever

00:19:17.580 --> 00:19:20.340
published of June's work
of her selected essays,

00:19:20.340 --> 00:19:25.580
Some Of Us Did Not Die, which
was titled 'Rage, Rage.'

00:19:25.580 --> 00:19:28.220
Too often, however, Jordan
rants rather than reasons,

00:19:28.220 --> 00:19:30.380
trading an analysis
of complex problems

00:19:30.380 --> 00:19:32.210
for self-righteous
expressions of anger

00:19:32.210 --> 00:19:34.050
at the injustices of the world.

00:19:34.050 --> 00:19:37.100
Her indignant
polemical reflections

00:19:37.100 --> 00:19:39.790
on affirmative action, black
rage, or duplicity in the White

00:19:39.790 --> 00:19:42.140
House in Some Of Us Did
Not Die promise only

00:19:42.140 --> 00:19:45.110
to attract the attention
of the already converted.

00:19:45.110 --> 00:19:48.410
Jordan's untamed energy and
take-no-prisoners attitude

00:19:48.410 --> 00:19:50.060
served her well as an activist.

00:19:50.060 --> 00:19:54.260
They have served her less well
as an essayist,' end quote.

00:19:54.260 --> 00:19:56.690
The reviewer offers
not one example

00:19:56.690 --> 00:19:59.780
of such rant, such indignant
polemical reflections,

00:19:59.780 --> 00:20:02.450
so I can't eviscerate
this reviewer's argument

00:20:02.450 --> 00:20:03.960
as I would like.

00:20:03.960 --> 00:20:06.770
But I point to this review
because, in the post-election

00:20:06.770 --> 00:20:10.130
world, in this nation
that loves to be post--

00:20:10.130 --> 00:20:12.590
loves more than anything
to hold onto the myth

00:20:12.590 --> 00:20:15.710
of the clean break and
the unexpected surprise

00:20:15.710 --> 00:20:17.780
rather than the
inevitable grinding

00:20:17.780 --> 00:20:21.290
conclusions of its own
unexamined psychic and material

00:20:21.290 --> 00:20:24.380
life, a number of
poets found themselves

00:20:24.380 --> 00:20:27.890
in a distinctly American,
they sought, crisis.

00:20:27.890 --> 00:20:31.190
They wanted to know where
our poets of dissent were.

00:20:31.190 --> 00:20:34.820
They who had for years
valued negative capability,

00:20:34.820 --> 00:20:38.300
that romantic posture of
uncertainty penned in a letter

00:20:38.300 --> 00:20:41.660
by a 21-year-old in the
British 19th century,

00:20:41.660 --> 00:20:44.570
and found that any naming
of something political,

00:20:44.570 --> 00:20:47.870
even if that naming is simple
description, as one might

00:20:47.870 --> 00:20:51.890
simply describe a
Nightingale or a Grecian urn

00:20:51.890 --> 00:20:53.930
or any other weather
surrounding our lives,

00:20:53.930 --> 00:20:58.450
was an obliteration to rather
than an entry to mystery.

00:20:58.450 --> 00:21:00.500
They who still refused
to look closely

00:21:00.500 --> 00:21:03.710
at how their criteria for a
good poem and a good nation

00:21:03.710 --> 00:21:05.300
have lined up.

00:21:05.300 --> 00:21:07.640
They who still refused to
see negative capability,

00:21:07.640 --> 00:21:10.280
and thought leading to negative
capability, and action,

00:21:10.280 --> 00:21:13.250
will ensure we will be
stuck in a cultural eternity

00:21:13.250 --> 00:21:15.530
of hand-wringing and yes, but.

00:21:15.530 --> 00:21:19.320
Or, as a friend put more
simply in grad school,

00:21:19.320 --> 00:21:22.650
'you can't put the CIA or the
FBI in a poem because those

00:21:22.650 --> 00:21:23.790
words are unpoetic.'

00:21:27.260 --> 00:21:31.600
Well, sure, but
whose fault is that?

00:21:31.600 --> 00:21:34.100
And sure, but what
poet of these states

00:21:34.100 --> 00:21:37.130
did not fall for that
charade of abstraction

00:21:37.130 --> 00:21:39.800
as profundity, as
poetic, and yet did

00:21:39.800 --> 00:21:43.490
not seed beauty and pleasure
and felicity and sex

00:21:43.490 --> 00:21:47.090
to ideology, nationalism,
calcification,

00:21:47.090 --> 00:21:50.840
or any easy shelter that
would be built upon exclusion,

00:21:50.840 --> 00:21:53.240
exclusion necessary or not?

00:21:53.240 --> 00:21:54.820
June.

00:21:54.820 --> 00:21:59.590
And what poet was not named by
any of these poets in crisis?

00:21:59.590 --> 00:22:00.880
June.

00:22:00.880 --> 00:22:04.300
And who does not have a
steady publishing house?

00:22:04.300 --> 00:22:05.380
June.

00:22:05.380 --> 00:22:07.990
And who did not get reviewed
much in The New York Times

00:22:07.990 --> 00:22:10.990
after she spoke out, for
example, on Palestine?

00:22:10.990 --> 00:22:12.070
June.

00:22:12.070 --> 00:22:15.010
And who was removed from
Pen America's board?

00:22:15.010 --> 00:22:15.910
June.

00:22:15.910 --> 00:22:18.220
And who was the white man
talking about when after

00:22:18.220 --> 00:22:20.650
reading he said, 'That black
women over there should be

00:22:20.650 --> 00:22:24.000
burned alive in green
fire,' end quote?

00:22:24.000 --> 00:22:25.030
June.

00:22:25.030 --> 00:22:29.470
And whose poem included the FBI
and the CIA and South Africa

00:22:29.470 --> 00:22:32.470
and Bedford-Stuy and
Park Avenue and American

00:22:32.470 --> 00:22:36.760
Airline and on and on, in one
edition of Norton Anthology

00:22:36.760 --> 00:22:39.670
of Modern Poetry, only
to have it removed

00:22:39.670 --> 00:22:41.920
from the more recent additions?

00:22:41.920 --> 00:22:43.120
June.

00:22:43.120 --> 00:22:45.500
Whose poem about George
Washington Carver,

00:22:45.500 --> 00:22:48.790
fine as it is, survived?

00:22:48.790 --> 00:22:49.840
June.

00:22:49.840 --> 00:22:52.600
And who is and remains
our litmus test for,

00:22:52.600 --> 00:22:56.020
well, do you really
want a poetry of dissent

00:22:56.020 --> 00:22:58.810
or do you want to hold
onto your faith in goodness

00:22:58.810 --> 00:23:00.010
and greatness?

00:23:00.010 --> 00:23:01.900
June.

00:23:01.900 --> 00:23:04.360
Until this literary
establishment--

00:23:04.360 --> 00:23:06.730
this American literary
establishment--

00:23:06.730 --> 00:23:11.290
can find a way to talk about
June's poetry, it is doomed.

00:23:11.290 --> 00:23:13.960
I mean to say, every criticism
leveled against June's work

00:23:13.960 --> 00:23:16.930
as I hear it-- that it is
too didactic, too angry, too

00:23:16.930 --> 00:23:19.600
difficult, too direct,
too loose, too free, too

00:23:19.600 --> 00:23:23.170
untamed, too black, too
sonorous, too big, too bi, too

00:23:23.170 --> 00:23:26.620
complicated, points to a
national and cultural crisis

00:23:26.620 --> 00:23:30.808
that, until addressed,
will doom us all.

00:23:30.808 --> 00:23:31.800
Five.

00:23:31.800 --> 00:23:33.784
June.

00:23:33.784 --> 00:23:36.264
Quote.

00:23:36.264 --> 00:23:40.510
'If you make my life horrible,
then when I can tell the truth,

00:23:40.510 --> 00:23:42.930
it will be a horrible truth.

00:23:42.930 --> 00:23:46.530
It will not sound good or
look good or, god-willing,

00:23:46.530 --> 00:23:48.120
feel good to you, either.'

00:23:48.120 --> 00:23:50.474
End quote.

00:23:50.474 --> 00:23:51.902
Six.

00:23:51.902 --> 00:23:52.854
June.

00:23:52.854 --> 00:23:54.760
Quote.

00:23:54.760 --> 00:23:58.060
'In the context of tragedy,
all polite behavior is a form

00:23:58.060 --> 00:23:59.530
of self-denial.'

00:23:59.530 --> 00:24:01.516
End quote.

00:24:01.516 --> 00:24:03.490
Seven.

00:24:03.490 --> 00:24:06.340
June as teacher.

00:24:06.340 --> 00:24:09.590
I use the name 'June'
despite having not

00:24:09.590 --> 00:24:14.160
met her because I speak to her
often, even as I write this.

00:24:14.160 --> 00:24:17.270
It is absolutely impossible
to write all of June.

00:24:17.270 --> 00:24:20.070
A bibliography would
be much more useful.

00:24:20.070 --> 00:24:23.020
But briefly, we can consider
a fraction of what she did

00:24:23.020 --> 00:24:25.940
and imagine redesign of Harlem
with Buckminster Fuller.

00:24:25.940 --> 00:24:29.010
A children's book, a young adult
novel, a [? pre to ?] Rome.

00:24:29.010 --> 00:24:31.530
An early era wherein
she wore skirts.

00:24:31.530 --> 00:24:35.310
A later era wherein she ironed
even, I hear, her jeans.

00:24:35.310 --> 00:24:38.690
Even in the middle of Nicaragua
in the middle of a revolution,

00:24:38.690 --> 00:24:40.460
which is a place
she wrote of, as she

00:24:40.460 --> 00:24:43.490
wrote of Lebanon, of
Palestine, of Iran.

00:24:43.490 --> 00:24:47.270
The founding of radical teaching
programs at CUNY, teachers

00:24:47.270 --> 00:24:49.820
and writers collective, and
finally, at UC Berkeley,

00:24:49.820 --> 00:24:51.740
her Poetry for the
People program,

00:24:51.740 --> 00:24:53.780
which she founded after
decades of teaching

00:24:53.780 --> 00:24:56.540
when she found herself teaching
an African-American studies

00:24:56.540 --> 00:24:58.610
course in literature
and a women's studies

00:24:58.610 --> 00:25:00.200
course in literature.

00:25:00.200 --> 00:25:03.860
And one was made up mostly
of black men and one mostly

00:25:03.860 --> 00:25:06.800
of white women and
there was no overlap

00:25:06.800 --> 00:25:09.140
and they were having
parallel conversations.

00:25:09.140 --> 00:25:12.200
And she said, well, this
should be in one room.

00:25:12.200 --> 00:25:14.660
The room she called, in
the vision of Martin Luther

00:25:14.660 --> 00:25:17.540
King, Jr., a beloved community.

00:25:17.540 --> 00:25:20.300
That room has been for me
the greatest lesson of all.

00:25:26.209 --> 00:25:26.709
One.

00:25:29.670 --> 00:25:32.010
I never met June Jordan.

00:25:32.010 --> 00:25:33.480
Her name was on
the schedule when

00:25:33.480 --> 00:25:36.600
I took Poetry for the People
in the spring of 2002.

00:25:36.600 --> 00:25:38.556
She died that summer.

00:25:38.556 --> 00:25:40.680
She never made it to her
class, though it was often

00:25:40.680 --> 00:25:44.160
promised she might, and at the
end of the very last student

00:25:44.160 --> 00:25:46.680
reading on the last
day, the instructor

00:25:46.680 --> 00:25:49.360
read a poem on her behalf."

00:25:49.360 --> 00:25:52.590
This strikes me all her
writing life in the one poem

00:25:52.590 --> 00:25:56.470
that she chose to leave us
with, so I will read it now.

00:26:07.420 --> 00:26:09.824
On a New Year's Eve.

00:26:12.800 --> 00:26:17.950
"Infinity doesn't interest
me not altogether anymore.

00:26:17.950 --> 00:26:20.210
I crawl and kneel
and grab about.

00:26:20.210 --> 00:26:24.680
I beg and listen for what can
go away, as easily as love.

00:26:24.680 --> 00:26:27.320
Or perish like the
children running hard

00:26:27.320 --> 00:26:28.730
on one-way streets.

00:26:28.730 --> 00:26:31.340
Infinity doesn't interest me.

00:26:31.340 --> 00:26:33.610
Not anymore.

00:26:33.610 --> 00:26:35.110
Not even repetition.

00:26:35.110 --> 00:26:39.140
Your, my, eye, lid, or
the colorings of sunrise,

00:26:39.140 --> 00:26:41.350
or all the sky
excitement added up

00:26:41.350 --> 00:26:44.650
is not enough to satisfy
this lusting adulation

00:26:44.650 --> 00:26:48.280
that I feel for your
brown arm before it moves.

00:26:48.280 --> 00:26:48.790
Moves.

00:26:48.790 --> 00:26:49.750
Changes up.

00:26:49.750 --> 00:26:51.580
The temporary sacred
tails that go.

00:26:51.580 --> 00:26:53.860
First bike ride around
the house when you first

00:26:53.860 --> 00:26:58.000
saw a squat opossum
carry babies on her back.

00:26:58.000 --> 00:27:00.370
Opossum up in the
persimmon tree.

00:27:00.370 --> 00:27:03.430
You reeling toward that
natural first absurdity

00:27:03.430 --> 00:27:07.130
with so much wonder, still
it shakes your voice.

00:27:07.130 --> 00:27:09.230
The temporary is the sacred.

00:27:09.230 --> 00:27:11.530
Takes me out.

00:27:11.530 --> 00:27:15.370
And even the stars and even
the snow and even the rain

00:27:15.370 --> 00:27:17.980
do not amount to much,
unless these things

00:27:17.980 --> 00:27:19.810
submit to some disturbance.

00:27:19.810 --> 00:27:24.490
Some derangement such as
when I yield myself belonging

00:27:24.490 --> 00:27:27.260
to your unmistaken body.

00:27:27.260 --> 00:27:30.920
And let the powerful lock up
the canyon, mountain peaks,

00:27:30.920 --> 00:27:34.280
the hidden rivers, waterfalls,
the deep down minerals,

00:27:34.280 --> 00:27:36.710
the coal fields, gold
fields, diamond mines.

00:27:36.710 --> 00:27:40.220
Close by the whoring ore hot
at the center of the Earth,

00:27:40.220 --> 00:27:42.980
spinning fast as numbers
I cannot imagine.

00:27:42.980 --> 00:27:48.020
Let the world blot, obliterate,
remove so-called magnificence.

00:27:48.020 --> 00:27:52.310
So-called all-mighty fathomless
and everlasting treasures.

00:27:52.310 --> 00:27:55.740
Wealth, whatever that may be.

00:27:55.740 --> 00:27:59.290
It is this time that matters.

00:27:59.290 --> 00:28:03.170
It is this history I care about.

00:28:03.170 --> 00:28:06.400
The one we make together.

00:28:06.400 --> 00:28:07.810
Awkward.

00:28:07.810 --> 00:28:12.700
Inconsistent as a lame cat
on the loose, or quick as

00:28:12.700 --> 00:28:17.350
kids freed by the bell, or else
as strictly once as only life

00:28:17.350 --> 00:28:18.010
must mean.

00:28:18.010 --> 00:28:20.590
A once upon a time.

00:28:20.590 --> 00:28:22.600
I have rejected
propaganda teaching me

00:28:22.600 --> 00:28:23.530
about the beautiful.

00:28:23.530 --> 00:28:25.870
The truly rare.

00:28:25.870 --> 00:28:28.840
Supposedly, the soft push of
the ocean at the hushed point

00:28:28.840 --> 00:28:29.500
of the shore.

00:28:29.500 --> 00:28:31.870
Supposedly, the soft
push of the ocean

00:28:31.870 --> 00:28:35.670
at the hushed point of the shore
is beautiful, for instance.

00:28:35.670 --> 00:28:39.390
But the truly rare
can stay out there.

00:28:39.390 --> 00:28:41.400
I have rejected
that abstraction,

00:28:41.400 --> 00:28:46.300
that enormity unless I see
a dog walk on the beach.

00:28:46.300 --> 00:28:48.990
A bird sees sandflies.

00:28:48.990 --> 00:28:53.160
Or yourself approach
me, laughing out a sound

00:28:53.160 --> 00:28:55.170
to spoil the pretty picture.

00:28:55.170 --> 00:28:58.140
Make an uncontrolled
heart-beating memory instead.

00:28:58.140 --> 00:29:02.430
I read the papers preaching
on that oil and oxygen,

00:29:02.430 --> 00:29:05.640
that redwoods and the evergreen,
that trees, the waters,

00:29:05.640 --> 00:29:08.040
and the atmosphere
compile a final listing

00:29:08.040 --> 00:29:09.580
of the world in short supply.

00:29:09.580 --> 00:29:13.800
But all alive and all the
lives persist, perpetual,

00:29:13.800 --> 00:29:14.790
in jeopardy.

00:29:14.790 --> 00:29:18.480
Persist as scarce
as every one of us.

00:29:18.480 --> 00:29:21.210
As difficult to find or keep.

00:29:21.210 --> 00:29:22.590
As irreplaceable.

00:29:22.590 --> 00:29:26.210
As frail as every one of us.

00:29:26.210 --> 00:29:31.430
And as I watch your
arm, your brown arm,

00:29:31.430 --> 00:29:39.280
just before it moves, I know all
things are dear that disappear.

00:29:39.280 --> 00:29:41.624
All things are dear
that disappear."

00:29:45.576 --> 00:29:48.046
[APPLAUSE]

00:29:54.480 --> 00:29:58.375
- Next, Imani Perry.

00:29:58.375 --> 00:30:00.040
- Good afternoon.

00:30:00.040 --> 00:30:02.260
- Good afternoon.

00:30:02.260 --> 00:30:05.800
- I am grateful to be here.

00:30:08.410 --> 00:30:13.550
I met June Jordan
once at a dinner,

00:30:13.550 --> 00:30:19.300
where some person with
extraordinary grace

00:30:19.300 --> 00:30:21.910
and generosity sat me between--

00:30:21.910 --> 00:30:25.000
Toni Morrison was on my left
and June Jordan was on my right

00:30:25.000 --> 00:30:30.500
and Derek Bell was in front of
me and I was a very young woman

00:30:30.500 --> 00:30:32.320
and thought I had died
and gone to heaven.

00:30:32.320 --> 00:30:36.970
And the thing that
was so beautiful

00:30:36.970 --> 00:30:39.100
about the moment for me--

00:30:39.100 --> 00:30:47.380
it wasn't a kind of an academic
or high-brow literati occasion,

00:30:47.380 --> 00:30:49.630
it was a dinner.

00:30:49.630 --> 00:30:57.610
And the dialogue was,
for lack of a term

00:30:57.610 --> 00:30:59.830
that I could translate
into standard English,

00:30:59.830 --> 00:31:02.200
was very down-home.

00:31:02.200 --> 00:31:06.340
And I was thinking today that
there is a direct relationship

00:31:06.340 --> 00:31:13.900
between the difficult miracle
and the downhome genius

00:31:13.900 --> 00:31:19.630
and that there's something
that she saw and heard

00:31:19.630 --> 00:31:27.430
at that crossroads and that I
am grateful to have witnessed.

00:31:27.430 --> 00:31:31.690
So I want to talk about a piece
that she wrote titled Report

00:31:31.690 --> 00:31:35.340
from the Bahamas, 1982.

00:31:35.340 --> 00:31:37.840
And I think generally,
there's work

00:31:37.840 --> 00:31:41.830
to be done about the idea
of reportage-- more work

00:31:41.830 --> 00:31:46.480
to be done about the idea of
reportage in black poetics.

00:31:46.480 --> 00:31:51.250
The way that it is
citational of the kind

00:31:51.250 --> 00:31:57.580
of truncated and fictionally
objective fashion of the way

00:31:57.580 --> 00:32:01.000
official stories are told.

00:32:01.000 --> 00:32:04.270
And then, with
their work, there's

00:32:04.270 --> 00:32:09.160
the morphing or the explosion
or the expansion of form

00:32:09.160 --> 00:32:11.890
that opens up language
as well as opens up

00:32:11.890 --> 00:32:15.490
history and functions
as an invitation

00:32:15.490 --> 00:32:20.050
to reconsider reportage through
a bricolage of documentation

00:32:20.050 --> 00:32:24.430
that sets aside
[? dispassions ?] and fictions

00:32:24.430 --> 00:32:26.800
of reportedly objectivity.

00:32:26.800 --> 00:32:30.790
So in the report, she describes
traveling to the Bahamas

00:32:30.790 --> 00:32:36.430
and staying in the Sheridan
British Colonial, and at first,

00:32:36.430 --> 00:32:40.725
she contemplates an image
of a middle-aged black man--

00:32:40.725 --> 00:32:43.600
this was as part of the
advertising of the hotel--

00:32:43.600 --> 00:32:47.410
middle-aged black man in
a tuxedo who is smiling.

00:32:47.410 --> 00:32:50.230
And he's serving white
customers while both

00:32:50.230 --> 00:32:52.870
of his feet, his shoes,
and the bottom 10

00:32:52.870 --> 00:32:57.610
inches of his trousers are
immersed in the salt water.

00:32:57.610 --> 00:33:00.710
And she writes, "He is so
delighted to serve you,

00:33:00.710 --> 00:33:02.560
he will wade into the
water to bring you

00:33:02.560 --> 00:33:07.990
banana daiquiris while you
float," she says sarcastically.

00:33:07.990 --> 00:33:11.260
And then she moves
from that to a message

00:33:11.260 --> 00:33:15.790
in the room from the
Ministry of Tourism

00:33:15.790 --> 00:33:18.880
that has this brief story
of New World history.

00:33:18.880 --> 00:33:21.730
And it's [? sort ?] of a
flyer and the flyer traces

00:33:21.730 --> 00:33:23.940
the thread of empire.

00:33:23.940 --> 00:33:25.960
So it describes
waves of conquest--

00:33:25.960 --> 00:33:28.270
Columbus, then the
American loyalists

00:33:28.270 --> 00:33:31.330
who fled to the Bahamas in the
aftermath of the Revolutionary

00:33:31.330 --> 00:33:34.090
War, and then the
Confederates who arrived there

00:33:34.090 --> 00:33:37.050
after the Civil War defeat.

00:33:37.050 --> 00:33:41.260
And she notes that legitimate
history, as it's conceived,

00:33:41.260 --> 00:33:45.910
tracks Europeans who
barge into new territory.

00:33:45.910 --> 00:33:49.780
And at once, though in the
citation of this flyer,

00:33:49.780 --> 00:33:53.430
it's once a single
story of empire,

00:33:53.430 --> 00:33:56.320
and as well, there's kind of
shards of a million stories

00:33:56.320 --> 00:33:57.820
of place and particularity.

00:33:57.820 --> 00:34:00.730
And she moves really
beautifully between the two

00:34:00.730 --> 00:34:04.620
over the course of the piece.

00:34:04.620 --> 00:34:08.110
And when she turns to
contemplate herself,

00:34:08.110 --> 00:34:10.389
she really deals with
a vexation about how

00:34:10.389 --> 00:34:12.280
she is situated in the world.

00:34:12.280 --> 00:34:14.810
And so on the one hand, she
describes herself as being,

00:34:14.810 --> 00:34:18.130
quote, "about to have a West
Indian fit over that man

00:34:18.130 --> 00:34:23.449
standing in the water, ruining
his shoes and his pants,"

00:34:23.449 --> 00:34:29.440
but then she compares herself
to him and talks about how,

00:34:29.440 --> 00:34:31.179
with all of her choices--

00:34:31.179 --> 00:34:34.010
all the choices that are
available to her in her life,

00:34:34.010 --> 00:34:35.800
she's a rich woman.

00:34:35.800 --> 00:34:41.139
A rich American woman who,
like the other black Americans

00:34:41.139 --> 00:34:45.130
who are staying in the
Sheraton British Colonial

00:34:45.130 --> 00:34:48.620
hotel, along with their
white counterparts,

00:34:48.620 --> 00:34:51.100
have come to the
Bahamas as tourists.

00:34:51.100 --> 00:34:53.739
And then she talks about how
they all sort of argue down

00:34:53.739 --> 00:34:56.590
the price of handmade
goods at the straw

00:34:56.590 --> 00:35:00.940
market, sold by women who must
sell them in order to eat.

00:35:04.290 --> 00:35:06.310
And she says, "and
so it continues,

00:35:06.310 --> 00:35:09.040
this weird succession
of crude intruders

00:35:09.040 --> 00:35:11.860
that now includes
me and my brothers

00:35:11.860 --> 00:35:14.620
and sisters from the north."

00:35:14.620 --> 00:35:18.165
And the north, in
that moment, it's

00:35:18.165 --> 00:35:21.310
a beautifully
ambiguous signifier.

00:35:21.310 --> 00:35:23.170
So it has a particular
signification

00:35:23.170 --> 00:35:25.870
of African-American
letters, right?

00:35:25.870 --> 00:35:28.075
Of an escape to freedom.

00:35:28.075 --> 00:35:31.570
But it's also the position
that now allows her or enables

00:35:31.570 --> 00:35:36.130
her to function as an intruder
in a long history of intruders

00:35:36.130 --> 00:35:38.820
in the Bahamas, right?

00:35:38.820 --> 00:35:40.870
So on the one hand,
there's this tradition

00:35:40.870 --> 00:35:45.610
of African-American letters of
mobility is a sign of freedom,

00:35:45.610 --> 00:35:47.540
but this is also an
instance in which

00:35:47.540 --> 00:35:52.390
it can operate as
a sign of becoming

00:35:52.390 --> 00:35:55.960
part of their colonial project.

00:35:55.960 --> 00:35:58.540
So Jordan sees all of this--

00:35:58.540 --> 00:36:03.600
her position of relative
power, her Americaness and not

00:36:03.600 --> 00:36:06.970
withstanding her blackness
and West Indianess--

00:36:06.970 --> 00:36:10.240
within the relations of
exploitation and consumption.

00:36:10.240 --> 00:36:14.770
And yet, she also notes, she has
to watch her coins on vacation.

00:36:14.770 --> 00:36:17.151
And she comments that she
isn't white, after all.

00:36:17.151 --> 00:36:17.650
Right?

00:36:17.650 --> 00:36:19.270
So she has to
budget the money she

00:36:19.270 --> 00:36:23.080
spends for this particular
kind of pleasure.

00:36:23.080 --> 00:36:30.310
So the kind of narrative force
that drives the piece gives it

00:36:30.310 --> 00:36:34.420
a kind of nuance that I
think is really important

00:36:34.420 --> 00:36:40.510
and is much richer, really,
than merely observing

00:36:40.510 --> 00:36:43.600
what we popularly call
today intersectionality,

00:36:43.600 --> 00:36:46.180
although in a sense, the
essay is about that, right?

00:36:46.180 --> 00:36:51.030
She is at the crossroads
of multiple identities.

00:36:51.030 --> 00:36:54.880
But she's also talking about the
multiple forces that are acting

00:36:54.880 --> 00:36:56.274
on people in their midst.

00:36:56.274 --> 00:36:58.690
That are shaping each of their
[INAUDIBLE] as it relations

00:36:58.690 --> 00:37:01.660
to power and wealth.

00:37:01.660 --> 00:37:06.790
And she's not simply
asserting that fact,

00:37:06.790 --> 00:37:10.390
but she's moving through
the trip in the essay

00:37:10.390 --> 00:37:16.900
and attending to human
encounters and what fracturing

00:37:16.900 --> 00:37:21.040
or intimacy they bear,
based upon the order

00:37:21.040 --> 00:37:23.260
of relations and power.

00:37:23.260 --> 00:37:26.980
And even further, she
asks throughout, what

00:37:26.980 --> 00:37:28.930
would the conditions
be that might

00:37:28.930 --> 00:37:32.260
make intimacy, which is the
foundation for solidarity,

00:37:32.260 --> 00:37:34.990
possible?

00:37:34.990 --> 00:37:38.590
So she describes the
woman who cleans her room,

00:37:38.590 --> 00:37:44.960
a woman named Olive,
and she wonders

00:37:44.960 --> 00:37:48.670
what sense Olive, if
she were to ask her,

00:37:48.670 --> 00:37:53.800
would make of her decision
to stay in the Sheraton.

00:37:53.800 --> 00:37:56.700
And in particular,
she confesses that she

00:37:56.700 --> 00:38:00.820
has chosen to stay in this
corporate hotel, a Sheraton,

00:38:00.820 --> 00:38:02.740
because they are
under the protection

00:38:02.740 --> 00:38:06.010
of a multinational corporation.

00:38:06.010 --> 00:38:09.715
She was less likely to be
harassed or attacked by men.

00:38:09.715 --> 00:38:12.370
And she says "a
black woman seeking

00:38:12.370 --> 00:38:14.530
refuge in a
multinational corporation

00:38:14.530 --> 00:38:17.320
may seem like a contradiction
to some, but there you are."

00:38:20.500 --> 00:38:24.370
And then ventriloquizes
Olive and imagines

00:38:24.370 --> 00:38:28.060
that her response would
probably be a judgmental one,

00:38:28.060 --> 00:38:29.830
wondering, why would
you travel this far

00:38:29.830 --> 00:38:32.920
without your husband anyway?

00:38:32.920 --> 00:38:35.050
Which is another
logic of protection

00:38:35.050 --> 00:38:37.180
built inside the
constraints of the world

00:38:37.180 --> 00:38:42.730
as it is, filled with both
patriarchy and capitalism.

00:38:42.730 --> 00:38:49.620
And Jordan doesn't have a
clear answer to that question.

00:38:49.620 --> 00:38:53.340
She thinks, "My rights and
my freedom and my desire

00:38:53.340 --> 00:38:56.410
and a slew of other
New World values,

00:38:56.410 --> 00:38:59.400
what would they sound like
to this black woman described

00:38:59.400 --> 00:39:03.700
on the card atop of my hotel
bureau as Olive, the maid?"

00:39:06.850 --> 00:39:08.590
And she speculates
that Olive would

00:39:08.590 --> 00:39:12.820
have no reason to worry
about Jordan's freedoms

00:39:12.820 --> 00:39:18.310
to choose a corporation to
stay in or to not travel

00:39:18.310 --> 00:39:19.300
without a husband.

00:39:19.300 --> 00:39:22.630
That she'd have no reason
to worry about them

00:39:22.630 --> 00:39:26.120
so long as Jordan didn't
give a damn about hers.

00:39:26.120 --> 00:39:27.820
And that's really an
instructive moment

00:39:27.820 --> 00:39:33.840
for the reader about politics
and what kind of politics

00:39:33.840 --> 00:39:34.715
you have.

00:39:34.715 --> 00:39:38.140
So there's a series
of other encounters.

00:39:38.140 --> 00:39:40.990
One is with a Jewish
novelist whose story

00:39:40.990 --> 00:39:44.740
of dealing with her overbearing
Talmudic Scholar father

00:39:44.740 --> 00:39:48.020
resonates with June
Jordan's own life.

00:39:48.020 --> 00:39:50.050
Another is a story
of a relationship

00:39:50.050 --> 00:39:53.830
with a Jewish student who's
enchantment with Yiddish

00:39:53.830 --> 00:40:01.990
and the manner in which the
syntax of a literary deployment

00:40:01.990 --> 00:40:06.820
of Yiddish was a way of
breaking through ghettoization,

00:40:06.820 --> 00:40:10.120
of being captured
inside yet marginalized.

00:40:10.120 --> 00:40:13.210
Connected with her own
love of Black English.

00:40:13.210 --> 00:40:16.020
And then she describes it
as "resonance falls apart"

00:40:16.020 --> 00:40:19.750
in a conversation with him
when he says he doesn't really

00:40:19.750 --> 00:40:22.720
care about the danger to the
Federal Student Loan program

00:40:22.720 --> 00:40:24.670
because it wouldn't affect him.

00:40:24.670 --> 00:40:27.820
And then she notes that
the loss of that program

00:40:27.820 --> 00:40:31.035
would jeopardize her own
son's attendance at college,

00:40:31.035 --> 00:40:33.370
so she's an instructor.

00:40:33.370 --> 00:40:37.690
She has an encounter with
a graduate student who

00:40:37.690 --> 00:40:40.870
is a white woman who
says to June Jordan,

00:40:40.870 --> 00:40:44.020
you're lucky because you have
issues that give you purpose,

00:40:44.020 --> 00:40:47.880
like poverty and police
brutality and discrimination.

00:40:47.880 --> 00:40:48.970
Right?

00:40:48.970 --> 00:40:51.310
But then-- this
is important-- she

00:40:51.310 --> 00:40:56.230
says the student who says
this describes herself

00:40:56.230 --> 00:40:57.790
as a housewife and a mother.

00:40:57.790 --> 00:40:59.200
In other words, nobody.

00:41:02.130 --> 00:41:05.960
And she says she did not believe
she was a person precisely

00:41:05.960 --> 00:41:09.140
because she had fulfilled the
traditional female functions.

00:41:11.900 --> 00:41:17.060
So you see, she's reading these
layers through the encounters,

00:41:17.060 --> 00:41:20.520
and as the encounters move
forward, we learn that--

00:41:20.520 --> 00:41:24.020
and so she's recalling the past
but also in the present moment

00:41:24.020 --> 00:41:27.530
in the Bahamas, and we learn
she's there during holy week.

00:41:27.530 --> 00:41:29.270
And the encounters
really structurally

00:41:29.270 --> 00:41:33.470
function like the passions
of the cross, traditionally

00:41:33.470 --> 00:41:38.870
celebrated during holy week, but
the choreography is unreliable.

00:41:38.870 --> 00:41:45.080
And yet as a refrain, she
places the Gospel hymn, "The Old

00:41:45.080 --> 00:41:48.590
Rugged Cross" in the peace.

00:41:48.590 --> 00:41:50.600
And the issue is
that-- you know,

00:41:50.600 --> 00:41:55.760
the way that I read it is that
the Easter miracle is at risk,

00:41:55.760 --> 00:41:59.600
she's saying, because the
suffering is not redemptive,

00:41:59.600 --> 00:42:03.500
or if it is, it's not righteous.

00:42:03.500 --> 00:42:08.300
And she tells this little
story about irritating a woman

00:42:08.300 --> 00:42:10.160
at a sandwich shop
because she's ordering

00:42:10.160 --> 00:42:13.220
so much food and the woman
is sort of like, why are you

00:42:13.220 --> 00:42:13.777
eating food?

00:42:13.777 --> 00:42:15.860
Because you're supposed
to be fasting because it's

00:42:15.860 --> 00:42:16.385
Good Friday.

00:42:19.830 --> 00:42:23.840
And the lesson for me is that--

00:42:23.840 --> 00:42:26.150
and one that she states
quite explicitly--

00:42:26.150 --> 00:42:28.910
is that a series of
assumptions that we

00:42:28.910 --> 00:42:33.170
make about connection along
lines of identity categories

00:42:33.170 --> 00:42:34.890
are wrong.

00:42:34.890 --> 00:42:37.730
The identity categories
or even the histories

00:42:37.730 --> 00:42:39.950
of marginalization are
insufficient grounds

00:42:39.950 --> 00:42:41.750
for connection.

00:42:41.750 --> 00:42:45.380
Having a common enemy
isn't enough, she says.

00:42:45.380 --> 00:42:47.755
The substance of the encounter--

00:42:47.755 --> 00:42:52.820
the moment of mutuality and
what might come of that--

00:42:52.820 --> 00:42:53.760
is what matters.

00:42:53.760 --> 00:42:58.520
And she describes it as the need
that we find between ourselves.

00:42:58.520 --> 00:43:03.230
And the report concludes with a
story of a black South African

00:43:03.230 --> 00:43:05.680
woman whose husband--

00:43:05.680 --> 00:43:07.280
and they're both
political organizers

00:43:07.280 --> 00:43:09.920
who she's been working with--

00:43:09.920 --> 00:43:14.300
and this woman has to flee
her husband's brutality

00:43:14.300 --> 00:43:16.510
and alcoholism.

00:43:16.510 --> 00:43:18.680
And she has an
Irish-American woman friend

00:43:18.680 --> 00:43:22.280
who is able to intervene and
sort of working with this woman

00:43:22.280 --> 00:43:24.370
to provide safety.

00:43:24.370 --> 00:43:26.540
And she refuses the
idea of this as a kind

00:43:26.540 --> 00:43:29.510
of neat Pollyanne-ish
sort of tying things up,

00:43:29.510 --> 00:43:33.520
look we're all the same,
because in the midst of that,

00:43:33.520 --> 00:43:37.370
in this extraordinary moment
of connection and sharing,

00:43:37.370 --> 00:43:40.370
she recalls the taunts of
Irish kids in her youth

00:43:40.370 --> 00:43:44.000
calling her by slurs.

00:43:44.000 --> 00:43:56.420
And so really what she hones
in on is the work of witnessing

00:43:56.420 --> 00:44:01.690
and that this
Irish-American woman

00:44:01.690 --> 00:44:04.590
was able to witness the South
African woman's experience

00:44:04.590 --> 00:44:09.240
in a way that allows her to help
her navigate safely through it.

00:44:09.240 --> 00:44:11.910
So I'm going to stop in a
moment, but I'll just say,

00:44:11.910 --> 00:44:16.540
I wanted to talk about this
piece for a couple of reasons.

00:44:16.540 --> 00:44:20.310
One is that I really appreciate
these kind of multiple vertices

00:44:20.310 --> 00:44:23.910
of position and identity
and social reality

00:44:23.910 --> 00:44:25.980
that she puts forth
again and again

00:44:25.980 --> 00:44:29.610
and it's an encounter
that resonates

00:44:29.610 --> 00:44:33.450
for me because, as a black
person having visited

00:44:33.450 --> 00:44:35.820
the Bahamas, all kinds of
thoughts of these words

00:44:35.820 --> 00:44:40.920
come into your mind
about class and power

00:44:40.920 --> 00:44:45.390
and relations of domination
and exploitation.

00:44:45.390 --> 00:44:47.970
And then she talks about the
multiplicity of who she is.

00:44:47.970 --> 00:44:50.830
She's West Indian, she's
American, she's middle class,

00:44:50.830 --> 00:44:52.680
she's class
insecure, she's rich,

00:44:52.680 --> 00:44:55.740
she is a woman protected from
black men by a corporation,

00:44:55.740 --> 00:44:58.215
she is an indecent woman
because she travels alone.

00:45:01.860 --> 00:45:03.930
And she cautions us
against this idea

00:45:03.930 --> 00:45:06.510
that is still trafficked
in quite a bit, if not

00:45:06.510 --> 00:45:09.510
more now than then, of
categorical identity

00:45:09.510 --> 00:45:12.600
tells you most of what you
need to know about struggling

00:45:12.600 --> 00:45:15.300
together or about
whether you're privileged

00:45:15.300 --> 00:45:17.790
or Bourgeois or
poor and oppressed.

00:45:17.790 --> 00:45:21.510
And I also love it because she
is radically honest about how

00:45:21.510 --> 00:45:23.880
she navigates these
relations of power,

00:45:23.880 --> 00:45:26.640
at times to her own advantage.

00:45:26.640 --> 00:45:29.100
That's the conundrum
that we find ourselves

00:45:29.100 --> 00:45:31.500
in in a society
structured the way this is

00:45:31.500 --> 00:45:33.910
and a world structured
the way it is.

00:45:33.910 --> 00:45:37.550
And finally, from my
own work on gender,

00:45:37.550 --> 00:45:41.995
in which I've tried to draw
the architecture of patriarchy

00:45:41.995 --> 00:45:46.830
and the patriarch and all his
ancillary figures surrounding

00:45:46.830 --> 00:45:52.380
him, where I try to
explore what that is,

00:45:52.380 --> 00:45:54.390
part of what I'm also
trying to figure out

00:45:54.390 --> 00:45:58.590
is, how do we
approach its undoing?

00:45:58.590 --> 00:46:02.010
And we have to ask how we might
be moved towards disrupting

00:46:02.010 --> 00:46:08.340
relations of domination
by responding

00:46:08.340 --> 00:46:12.500
to the term I like that
Stanley Cavell uses is

00:46:12.500 --> 00:46:14.310
the passionate utterance.

00:46:14.310 --> 00:46:19.570
A suggestion of another way
of being with one another.

00:46:19.570 --> 00:46:22.080
That we might move towards
a different relation--

00:46:22.080 --> 00:46:25.380
something closer to
ethical relations--

00:46:25.380 --> 00:46:29.430
with the first step of
being able to fully listen.

00:46:29.430 --> 00:46:32.400
And in a sense, what June
Jordan is doing in this piece

00:46:32.400 --> 00:46:36.510
is both listening for
impassioned utterances

00:46:36.510 --> 00:46:39.720
and also offering one.

00:46:39.720 --> 00:46:42.510
And perhaps most
telling in that regard

00:46:42.510 --> 00:46:45.720
is that this story
doesn't arrive on Easter.

00:46:45.720 --> 00:46:48.990
And she talks about it being
Good Friday but Easter doesn't

00:46:48.990 --> 00:46:51.740
come explicitly in the piece.

00:46:51.740 --> 00:46:54.850
The marking of time in it
remains with Good Friday--

00:46:54.850 --> 00:46:59.292
the period of waiting and
wondering about salvation.

00:46:59.292 --> 00:47:01.216
[APPLAUSE]

00:47:08.431 --> 00:47:10.628
- To bring us
home, Mariame Kaba.

00:47:14.420 --> 00:47:20.390
- So people often get
up on these occasions

00:47:20.390 --> 00:47:22.790
and say that it's
really an honor

00:47:22.790 --> 00:47:25.400
to be in the space
with everyone here

00:47:25.400 --> 00:47:29.240
and they usually will then thank
the organizers of the event

00:47:29.240 --> 00:47:30.139
for their hard work.

00:47:30.139 --> 00:47:32.180
And then they're going to
say that they're really

00:47:32.180 --> 00:47:36.320
thrilled to be sharing the stage
with a lustrous co-panelist who

00:47:36.320 --> 00:47:38.060
they greatly admire.

00:47:38.060 --> 00:47:39.740
And then they'll
say that they need

00:47:39.740 --> 00:47:42.770
to take a moment to actually
thank the audience for showing

00:47:42.770 --> 00:47:47.740
up in a terrible snow
storm that's about to start

00:47:47.740 --> 00:47:51.680
and I know you all want to
get home as soon as possible,

00:47:51.680 --> 00:47:54.710
and that's what people usually
say at times like these

00:47:54.710 --> 00:47:58.880
and those are all true for
me, but also for me, WTF.

00:47:58.880 --> 00:48:03.080
I cannot believe that I was
invited to speak at an event

00:48:03.080 --> 00:48:06.170
commemorating the
legacy of June Jordan.

00:48:06.170 --> 00:48:09.020
June Jordan, who has been
a touchstone of mine,

00:48:09.020 --> 00:48:11.270
really, since I
first read her work

00:48:11.270 --> 00:48:14.489
in college, which was
many, many years ago.

00:48:14.489 --> 00:48:16.530
And so I really can't
believe that I'm here today

00:48:16.530 --> 00:48:19.280
and I'm really grateful
to be here with all of you

00:48:19.280 --> 00:48:22.550
to celebrate her
legacy and her life.

00:48:22.550 --> 00:48:25.940
June Jordan loved
black people and so do

00:48:25.940 --> 00:48:33.245
I. She was an educator and
so am I. She was an activist

00:48:33.245 --> 00:48:37.670
and so am I. She was
an internationalist

00:48:37.670 --> 00:48:43.610
and so am I. She was a
brilliant writer and I am not.

00:48:43.610 --> 00:48:44.420
At all.

00:48:44.420 --> 00:48:48.230
So bear with me.

00:48:48.230 --> 00:48:51.110
Before I was anything,
though, I was a youth worker

00:48:51.110 --> 00:48:57.290
and I was this when I was
15 and I am still at 46.

00:48:57.290 --> 00:48:58.270
Youth workers teach.

00:48:58.270 --> 00:49:02.480
We mentor, we advocate,
we counsel, we console.

00:49:02.480 --> 00:49:03.590
Most of all, we love.

00:49:03.590 --> 00:49:05.540
We love young people.

00:49:05.540 --> 00:49:08.030
When I read Jordan's
essay, "Nobody

00:49:08.030 --> 00:49:11.660
Mean More to Me than You and the
Future Life of Willie Jordan,"

00:49:11.660 --> 00:49:14.432
the youth worker in
me recognized myself

00:49:14.432 --> 00:49:15.890
in the now hundreds
of young people

00:49:15.890 --> 00:49:20.010
I've taught, counseled, and
loved over the past decades.

00:49:20.010 --> 00:49:25.760
So this brings me to Michael and
to the future life of Michael.

00:49:25.760 --> 00:49:29.150
Michael's been shot, the
voice on the phone says.

00:49:29.150 --> 00:49:29.880
He's alive.

00:49:29.880 --> 00:49:31.400
He'll recover.

00:49:31.400 --> 00:49:33.350
I breathe easier.

00:49:33.350 --> 00:49:35.240
Temporarily relieved.

00:49:35.240 --> 00:49:37.130
It's a reprieve.

00:49:37.130 --> 00:49:40.880
Michael was 18 and
on borrowed time.

00:49:40.880 --> 00:49:44.820
He reminds me regularly that
he's not long for this world.

00:49:44.820 --> 00:49:46.750
I've heard the words
in some variations

00:49:46.750 --> 00:49:48.590
so often that they
now pour off me

00:49:48.590 --> 00:49:50.750
like water from a shower head.

00:49:50.750 --> 00:49:52.880
What is the antidote
to the certainty

00:49:52.880 --> 00:49:55.340
about one's impending death?

00:49:55.340 --> 00:49:57.560
How does one live with
the specter of death

00:49:57.560 --> 00:49:59.690
as a constant companion?

00:49:59.690 --> 00:50:01.540
The certainty is a thief.

00:50:01.540 --> 00:50:03.260
It robs me of language.

00:50:03.260 --> 00:50:05.480
I've lost my tongue.

00:50:05.480 --> 00:50:09.140
I want to break my silence to
say that I love him and I would

00:50:09.140 --> 00:50:13.160
be devastated if he didn't
live until he's at least 100,

00:50:13.160 --> 00:50:14.770
but I don't respond.

00:50:14.770 --> 00:50:17.150
I pretend that I
don't hear the words.

00:50:17.150 --> 00:50:19.760
I'm numb, and after all,
I can't guarantee that he

00:50:19.760 --> 00:50:21.890
will live to become an old man.

00:50:21.890 --> 00:50:25.010
He's young, he's
black, he's poor.

00:50:25.010 --> 00:50:28.070
He lives on the west
side of Chicago.

00:50:28.070 --> 00:50:31.430
So I steel myself for
bad news every morning,

00:50:31.430 --> 00:50:34.160
and this time, it arrives.

00:50:34.160 --> 00:50:39.080
Michael belongs to the tribe
of the young and the unmoored.

00:50:39.080 --> 00:50:40.850
His body is passing
through and he

00:50:40.850 --> 00:50:43.700
has no expectations of staying.

00:50:43.700 --> 00:50:45.890
We rode on the L together once.

00:50:45.890 --> 00:50:48.800
Michael's voice boomed
throughout the trip.

00:50:48.800 --> 00:50:50.540
I asked him to lower it.

00:50:50.540 --> 00:50:54.260
He looked at me for a moment
and kept loud talking.

00:50:54.260 --> 00:50:57.530
I was embarrassed at his
display and I felt disrespected

00:50:57.530 --> 00:50:59.660
that he ignored my request.

00:50:59.660 --> 00:51:03.320
These are emotions that
youth workers often feel.

00:51:03.320 --> 00:51:05.720
As soon as we got
off the L, his voice

00:51:05.720 --> 00:51:08.600
returned to its
normal decibel level.

00:51:08.600 --> 00:51:12.140
I asked why he spoke
so loudly on the train.

00:51:12.140 --> 00:51:15.335
His response, I want
them uncomfortable

00:51:15.335 --> 00:51:18.530
and they need to
know that I was here.

00:51:18.530 --> 00:51:19.910
My anger dissipated.

00:51:19.910 --> 00:51:21.890
I have never
forgotten his words.

00:51:21.890 --> 00:51:23.600
They are seared in my mind.

00:51:23.600 --> 00:51:26.270
They need to know
that I was here.

00:51:26.270 --> 00:51:30.620
We've never spoken of what
it's like to feel not here.

00:51:30.620 --> 00:51:33.550
In Michael's words,
I hear June Jordan's.

00:51:33.550 --> 00:51:36.090
I will no longer
lightly walk behind

00:51:36.090 --> 00:51:38.180
a one of you who fear me.

00:51:38.180 --> 00:51:39.560
Be afraid.

00:51:39.560 --> 00:51:41.990
I plan to give you reasons
for your jumpy fits

00:51:41.990 --> 00:51:43.520
and facial tics.

00:51:43.520 --> 00:51:47.120
I will not walk politely
on the pavements anymore.

00:51:47.120 --> 00:51:48.670
I must become.

00:51:48.670 --> 00:51:51.980
I must become a
menace to my enemies.

00:51:51.980 --> 00:51:54.860
Michael is in fact
a menace to society.

00:51:54.860 --> 00:51:57.890
A problem to be managed,
controlled, and contained

00:51:57.890 --> 00:51:59.930
by any means necessary.

00:51:59.930 --> 00:52:02.810
He knows it and is
expected to swallow

00:52:02.810 --> 00:52:07.670
his rage as he is surveilled
in stores and on the streets.

00:52:07.670 --> 00:52:11.240
As he is targeted by cops
for endless stops and frisks.

00:52:11.240 --> 00:52:13.490
As he is repeatedly denied jobs.

00:52:13.490 --> 00:52:15.260
As his schools are closed.

00:52:15.260 --> 00:52:18.470
As he looks over his shoulder
dodging bullets and as he

00:52:18.470 --> 00:52:20.600
is locked in cages
with thousands

00:52:20.600 --> 00:52:22.970
who look just like him.

00:52:22.970 --> 00:52:24.560
A young man who has
been behind bars

00:52:24.560 --> 00:52:26.690
for most of his formative
years has told me

00:52:26.690 --> 00:52:29.660
on more than one occasion
that he was always

00:52:29.660 --> 00:52:33.560
certain his life held only
two viable possibilities--

00:52:33.560 --> 00:52:36.890
die in the streets
or die in prison.

00:52:36.890 --> 00:52:38.870
Jordan tells us
that most Americans

00:52:38.870 --> 00:52:42.020
have imagined that problems
affecting black life

00:52:42.020 --> 00:52:45.650
follow from pathogenic
attributes of black people

00:52:45.650 --> 00:52:48.740
and not from the
malfunctions of the state.

00:52:48.740 --> 00:52:51.530
I've been a witness to the
malfunctions of every Chicago

00:52:51.530 --> 00:52:54.350
institution--
schools, government,

00:52:54.350 --> 00:52:56.450
law enforcement, and more.

00:52:56.450 --> 00:52:59.510
Malfunctions which
pile up and crush hope.

00:52:59.510 --> 00:53:01.460
Poet and teacher,
Kevin Coval, has

00:53:01.460 --> 00:53:05.450
written, "Every institution
in Chicago fails black youth.

00:53:05.450 --> 00:53:08.260
Segregated and systematically
inequitable, Chicago

00:53:08.260 --> 00:53:11.810
is a town where white kids
exist in an increasingly idyllic

00:53:11.810 --> 00:53:15.710
new urban utopia and black and
Latino kids weave and dodge

00:53:15.710 --> 00:53:17.990
through a war zone."

00:53:17.990 --> 00:53:21.690
Michael has been in and out of
confinement since he was 13.

00:53:21.690 --> 00:53:24.920
My work has meant being a
witness to the everyday damage

00:53:24.920 --> 00:53:27.830
that incarceration does to
the future prospects of so

00:53:27.830 --> 00:53:31.890
many people who get caught
in a system of arrest, jail,

00:53:31.890 --> 00:53:34.200
surveillance, and re-arrest.

00:53:34.200 --> 00:53:36.420
This cycle makes it
harder for individuals

00:53:36.420 --> 00:53:39.450
to find and hold on to
stable housing, jobs,

00:53:39.450 --> 00:53:41.220
and relationships.

00:53:41.220 --> 00:53:44.820
It aggravates mental health
and substance abuse problems.

00:53:44.820 --> 00:53:47.440
Prisons are not places
for transformation

00:53:47.440 --> 00:53:50.970
and they are not appropriate
social service providers.

00:53:50.970 --> 00:53:53.790
Incarceration is a
traumatic experience.

00:53:53.790 --> 00:53:57.120
People spend years after
their release working to heal.

00:53:57.120 --> 00:54:00.390
Michael is unhealed still.

00:54:00.390 --> 00:54:03.380
I visit Michael in the
hospital and I hate hospitals.

00:54:03.380 --> 00:54:05.030
He smiles wanly.

00:54:05.030 --> 00:54:06.680
I burst into tears.

00:54:06.680 --> 00:54:08.510
The temporary relief
I feel is quickly

00:54:08.510 --> 00:54:10.610
replaced by dread that
can't be dislodged

00:54:10.610 --> 00:54:12.350
in the pit of my stomach.

00:54:12.350 --> 00:54:14.300
I worry about retaliation.

00:54:14.300 --> 00:54:16.820
I worry that violence
begets more violence.

00:54:16.820 --> 00:54:18.590
I worry about Michael.

00:54:18.590 --> 00:54:21.950
This is a young man living
in exile in his own country.

00:54:21.950 --> 00:54:23.960
His humanity is unacknowledged.

00:54:23.960 --> 00:54:25.850
He languishes in a place
that Richard Wright

00:54:25.850 --> 00:54:27.680
has called no man's land.

00:54:27.680 --> 00:54:31.040
Or maybe it's the place June
Jordan called "otherwhere."

00:54:31.040 --> 00:54:33.770
He is allowed no feelings.

00:54:33.770 --> 00:54:35.360
He is just a threat.

00:54:35.360 --> 00:54:38.570
All of our fears
rests on and in him.

00:54:38.570 --> 00:54:41.510
I remember our ride on
the L and his words to me,

00:54:41.510 --> 00:54:43.970
"They need to know
that I was here,"

00:54:43.970 --> 00:54:45.530
and I recognize
that he is demanding

00:54:45.530 --> 00:54:49.550
to be seen in all of his
humanity by the larger world.

00:54:49.550 --> 00:54:52.560
Yet one constant
throughout American history

00:54:52.560 --> 00:54:55.130
is a persistent denial
of black humanity

00:54:55.130 --> 00:54:58.090
and a callous
disregard of back pain.

00:54:58.090 --> 00:55:00.850
June Jordan understood
this all too well,

00:55:00.850 --> 00:55:02.920
but she was not defeated by it.

00:55:02.920 --> 00:55:05.530
She insisted that, by
organizing, we have the power

00:55:05.530 --> 00:55:07.420
to overcome oppression.

00:55:07.420 --> 00:55:09.640
I, too, believe this to be true.

00:55:09.640 --> 00:55:11.600
She was righteously outraged.

00:55:11.600 --> 00:55:13.000
I am, too.

00:55:13.000 --> 00:55:15.040
As far as I know,
Michael hasn't taken part

00:55:15.040 --> 00:55:16.730
in the ongoing movement
for black lives

00:55:16.730 --> 00:55:18.760
protests and organizing.

00:55:18.760 --> 00:55:21.010
His struggle is to
live day to day.

00:55:21.010 --> 00:55:23.530
His resistance is to stay
alive and he is courageous

00:55:23.530 --> 00:55:25.600
in his personal fight.

00:55:25.600 --> 00:55:28.300
June talked a lot about courage.

00:55:28.300 --> 00:55:31.300
The courage of South Africans
fighting against apartheid

00:55:31.300 --> 00:55:34.210
and of students sitting
in to insist that Columbia

00:55:34.210 --> 00:55:36.890
and Harvard divest from it.

00:55:36.890 --> 00:55:40.190
She reminded us of the
truth that only evil

00:55:40.190 --> 00:55:42.110
will collaborate with evil.

00:55:42.110 --> 00:55:44.030
Were she alive today,
I believe that she'd

00:55:44.030 --> 00:55:46.790
tell us that the prison
industrial complex is evil

00:55:46.790 --> 00:55:48.920
and we must not collaborate.

00:55:48.920 --> 00:55:50.510
We must refuse.

00:55:50.510 --> 00:55:55.080
For me, that refusal is rooted
in an abolitionist politic.

00:55:55.080 --> 00:55:59.400
As Dean Spade says, "We see the
abolition of policing, prisons,

00:55:59.400 --> 00:56:01.100
jails, and detention
not strictly

00:56:01.100 --> 00:56:03.920
as a narrow answer
to imprisonment

00:56:03.920 --> 00:56:06.830
and the abuses that
occur within prisons

00:56:06.830 --> 00:56:10.880
but also as a challenge to
the rule of poverty, violence,

00:56:10.880 --> 00:56:13.730
racism, alienation, and
disconnection that we

00:56:13.730 --> 00:56:15.560
face every day.

00:56:15.560 --> 00:56:18.200
Abolition is the practice of
transformation in the here

00:56:18.200 --> 00:56:21.020
and now and the everafter."

00:56:21.020 --> 00:56:23.670
I've organized for many
years alongside young people,

00:56:23.670 --> 00:56:27.020
so I am of course inspired by
the high school students who

00:56:27.020 --> 00:56:30.620
are currently in the streets,
demanding a change to gun laws,

00:56:30.620 --> 00:56:35.090
and saying that they refuse to
be used for target practice.

00:56:35.090 --> 00:56:37.224
But their activism is not new.

00:56:37.224 --> 00:56:39.140
We've seen young people
of color, particularly

00:56:39.140 --> 00:56:42.860
young black and brown people,
facing down tanks, demanding

00:56:42.860 --> 00:56:45.590
policy change, and insisting
that black lives matter

00:56:45.590 --> 00:56:48.090
for five years now.

00:56:48.090 --> 00:56:54.730
And we've seen their forbearers
for 50 and 100 years before.

00:56:54.730 --> 00:56:57.170
It's been six years since
the Dream Defenders descended

00:56:57.170 --> 00:57:00.680
on Tallahassee, Florida
to occupy the capital when

00:57:00.680 --> 00:57:04.880
Trayvon Martin was killed almost
six years ago next Monday.

00:57:04.880 --> 00:57:09.480
They demanded an end to racist
standard ground gun laws then.

00:57:09.480 --> 00:57:10.490
We like to forget.

00:57:10.490 --> 00:57:13.350
To unsee what has already
happened in this country,

00:57:13.350 --> 00:57:16.220
particularly if the people
we need to remember and see

00:57:16.220 --> 00:57:22.850
are of color or LGBTQ or poor
or undocumented or Muslim or,

00:57:22.850 --> 00:57:24.770
or, or.

00:57:24.770 --> 00:57:28.880
Sonia Sanchez encourages us to
call on our residual memories.

00:57:28.880 --> 00:57:30.650
She reminds us that
in political struggle,

00:57:30.650 --> 00:57:32.930
we must call for on
our ancestors who

00:57:32.930 --> 00:57:37.130
can help us to navigate
the trials of our present.

00:57:37.130 --> 00:57:38.630
She is speaking
about the importance

00:57:38.630 --> 00:57:42.470
of [INAUDIBLE] in whatever form
that it might manifest for you.

00:57:42.470 --> 00:57:45.020
Quote, "We must hear
the voices and have

00:57:45.020 --> 00:57:48.440
the dreams of those who came
before us and we must keep them

00:57:48.440 --> 00:57:51.050
with us in a very real sense.

00:57:51.050 --> 00:57:53.320
This will keep us centered."

00:57:53.320 --> 00:57:54.590
Unquote.

00:57:54.590 --> 00:57:56.150
Aren't we blessed
the June Jordan

00:57:56.150 --> 00:57:59.870
is one of the ancestors who we
can call on and hear her voice

00:57:59.870 --> 00:58:04.490
to keep us centered in this
current stormy weather?

00:58:04.490 --> 00:58:07.580
What can we hear from
her in this moment?

00:58:07.580 --> 00:58:09.590
I think that love
is a requirement

00:58:09.590 --> 00:58:13.660
of principled struggle, both
self-love and love of others.

00:58:13.660 --> 00:58:16.610
That we must all do what we can.

00:58:16.610 --> 00:58:19.940
That it is better to do
something rather than nothing.

00:58:19.940 --> 00:58:24.110
That we have to trust
others as well as ourselves.

00:58:24.110 --> 00:58:27.240
I often repeat the adage
that hope is a discipline.

00:58:27.240 --> 00:58:29.270
We must practice it daily.

00:58:29.270 --> 00:58:32.090
June's work teaches
us this truth,

00:58:32.090 --> 00:58:34.220
and tonight, it is
my privilege to stand

00:58:34.220 --> 00:58:37.670
with you a poem written
on September 11, 2001,

00:58:37.670 --> 00:58:39.290
Jordan tells us.

00:58:39.290 --> 00:58:41.840
"Resolving to work
harder than I have ever

00:58:41.840 --> 00:58:45.950
worked for the sake of justice,
which is the only true path

00:58:45.950 --> 00:58:47.240
to peace."

00:58:47.240 --> 00:58:52.820
This is written several months
before she dies in 2002.

00:58:52.820 --> 00:58:56.570
So I'm calling on all
of us to do the same.

00:58:56.570 --> 00:58:59.780
To secure the future life
of all of the Micheals

00:58:59.780 --> 00:59:03.480
and the Michelles in
our country and beyond.

00:59:03.480 --> 00:59:04.810
Thank you.

00:59:04.810 --> 00:59:07.260
[APPLAUSE]

00:59:18.540 --> 00:59:21.250
- So hi, everybody.

00:59:21.250 --> 00:59:25.230
Thank you all for brilliant,
beautiful, thoughtful, loving

00:59:25.230 --> 00:59:26.550
presentations.

00:59:26.550 --> 00:59:30.230
I wanted to ask first of
all just about teaching

00:59:30.230 --> 00:59:31.900
June Jordan's work.

00:59:31.900 --> 00:59:33.360
And where for you
all, teaching her

00:59:33.360 --> 00:59:35.580
work in the contemporary
moment, where

00:59:35.580 --> 00:59:37.680
are the moments of
surprise in the teaching?

00:59:37.680 --> 00:59:40.860
Where are you finding that the
poems and the essays really

00:59:40.860 --> 00:59:43.230
sort of cut across the
way many of our students

00:59:43.230 --> 00:59:45.960
are being socialized to think
in the contemporary moment,

00:59:45.960 --> 00:59:48.480
whether it's about identity,
which has already come up,

00:59:48.480 --> 00:59:51.180
or whether or not the CIA
and the FBI are poetic words

00:59:51.180 --> 00:59:52.530
or not?

00:59:52.530 --> 00:59:55.530
Or even about temporality
and life expectation.

00:59:55.530 --> 00:59:57.330
What they can expect
from a full life.

00:59:57.330 --> 00:59:59.913
So I was wondering if you could
all talk about that for a bit.

01:00:05.360 --> 01:00:07.610
- So the class where--

01:00:07.610 --> 01:00:10.820
I teach June Jordan's
work in two classes.

01:00:10.820 --> 01:00:13.250
One is Introduction to
African-American Studies

01:00:13.250 --> 01:00:15.850
and the other,
though, which I guess

01:00:15.850 --> 01:00:19.070
is the more surprising one, is
I teach a course on black women

01:00:19.070 --> 01:00:21.920
in social policy.

01:00:21.920 --> 01:00:27.410
And I don't know if
it's quite-- it's not--

01:00:27.410 --> 01:00:29.180
it's surprising,
particularly for those

01:00:29.180 --> 01:00:33.080
who major in political
science or public policy,

01:00:33.080 --> 01:00:36.920
to get poems in a policy
class, but there's

01:00:36.920 --> 01:00:45.330
something about the kind
of register connecting

01:00:45.330 --> 01:00:50.340
to both the ethical questions
and the interior life

01:00:50.340 --> 01:00:55.920
that you get in the poetry
that is not accessible to them

01:00:55.920 --> 01:01:02.400
in the same way in the
history or the politics books,

01:01:02.400 --> 01:01:07.860
and so it allows for
an interpretation

01:01:07.860 --> 01:01:11.670
and an understanding
of that material that's

01:01:11.670 --> 01:01:13.290
much richer, actually.

01:01:13.290 --> 01:01:19.140
When you actually can be
inside the lives of people.

01:01:19.140 --> 01:01:23.040
And so for me, it's a
real pedagogical lesson

01:01:23.040 --> 01:01:29.340
but it's also a lesson as a
student of what kinds of work

01:01:29.340 --> 01:01:31.830
is necessary to understand--

01:01:31.830 --> 01:01:35.270
for us to read, for us to--

01:01:35.270 --> 01:01:37.892
so yeah, so that's the--

01:01:42.760 --> 01:01:47.770
- So I sometimes teach
in prisons, particularly

01:01:47.770 --> 01:01:51.340
in juvenile detention centers
in the last few years,

01:01:51.340 --> 01:01:56.050
and I guess it was right
after Eric Garner was killed.

01:01:56.050 --> 01:02:01.840
I taught a class with students
at the JTDC, the Juvenile

01:02:01.840 --> 01:02:04.720
Temporary Detention
Center, Cook County,

01:02:04.720 --> 01:02:09.730
and we read her poem
about police violence,

01:02:09.730 --> 01:02:12.820
which the beginning
is, "Tell me something.

01:02:12.820 --> 01:02:15.340
What do you think would
happen if every time they

01:02:15.340 --> 01:02:18.130
kill a black boy,
then we kill a cop?

01:02:18.130 --> 01:02:21.130
Every time they kill a black
man, then we kill a cop.

01:02:21.130 --> 01:02:25.300
You think the accident rate
would lower subsequently?"

01:02:25.300 --> 01:02:31.120
And it was really something
for those young people

01:02:31.120 --> 01:02:32.870
on the inside.

01:02:32.870 --> 01:02:39.230
One of the young people said to
me, did they get her for that?

01:02:39.230 --> 01:02:40.970
Like, is she OK?

01:02:40.970 --> 01:02:42.220
Like, do you know what I mean?

01:02:42.220 --> 01:02:45.550
Like just could not
fathom that anybody

01:02:45.550 --> 01:02:48.560
could write those words now.

01:02:48.560 --> 01:02:50.710
And that tells
you everything you

01:02:50.710 --> 01:02:53.080
need to know about the
surprise and the relevancy

01:02:53.080 --> 01:02:56.740
of those terms today and
what would have happened

01:02:56.740 --> 01:03:00.550
had June been alive
in 2014 and had put

01:03:00.550 --> 01:03:03.490
that poem out on the internet.

01:03:03.490 --> 01:03:05.170
What would have
happened on Facebook

01:03:05.170 --> 01:03:10.610
or on Twitter for those lines
to be posted by a writer today?

01:03:10.610 --> 01:03:13.810
So I always think
about the fact that,

01:03:13.810 --> 01:03:17.620
in some ways, how far back
we've regressed as much as we've

01:03:17.620 --> 01:03:20.740
progressed, and again,
for young people

01:03:20.740 --> 01:03:23.620
to be so stunned that anybody
would write these words

01:03:23.620 --> 01:03:27.160
and not have the FBI grab
them from their house,

01:03:27.160 --> 01:03:31.900
as many have been grabbed
in the current moment.

01:03:31.900 --> 01:03:33.310
So I think about that a lot.

01:03:33.310 --> 01:03:35.800
I think about the
things that people

01:03:35.800 --> 01:03:39.520
could write in the past that
can't be written today because

01:03:39.520 --> 01:03:42.457
of social media, frankly,
and because that is just

01:03:42.457 --> 01:03:43.540
a different kind of thing.

01:03:43.540 --> 01:03:46.230
You're writing it
into the ether and it

01:03:46.230 --> 01:03:49.940
is consumed by any
number of people,

01:03:49.940 --> 01:03:52.990
but you could have done it
before in a book that nobody

01:03:52.990 --> 01:03:55.780
would have seen and
you could have read it

01:03:55.780 --> 01:03:57.340
in a room with
like-minded people

01:03:57.340 --> 01:03:59.380
who wouldn't report
you to the cops.

01:03:59.380 --> 01:04:03.780
So I think that changes the
life of the young folks who

01:04:03.780 --> 01:04:07.390
are organizing today very
much, and so when they see

01:04:07.390 --> 01:04:09.910
those kinds of things,
they think to themselves,

01:04:09.910 --> 01:04:12.290
you definitely
can't do that now.

01:04:12.290 --> 01:04:13.580
So I think about that a lot.

01:04:20.780 --> 01:04:21.740
- I think about--

01:04:24.570 --> 01:04:26.177
I teach her work mostly in--

01:04:26.177 --> 01:04:28.260
I mean, I mostly teach
creative writing workshops,

01:04:28.260 --> 01:04:29.635
so that's where
I teach her work,

01:04:29.635 --> 01:04:32.280
and one of the
things that continues

01:04:32.280 --> 01:04:36.150
to be surprising to me whenever
I revisit her and teach her

01:04:36.150 --> 01:04:41.670
is how instructive
her essays are.

01:04:41.670 --> 01:04:45.520
So that even, for example,
"Report From the Bahamas,"

01:04:45.520 --> 01:04:48.255
which is an argument
for a kind of connection

01:04:48.255 --> 01:04:50.280
and the building
of connection, she

01:04:50.280 --> 01:04:54.510
gives a very specific example
of how that was done, albeit

01:04:54.510 --> 01:04:59.100
messily and imperfectly, by
herself between two students--

01:04:59.100 --> 01:05:02.640
that Irish woman and the
South African student.

01:05:02.640 --> 01:05:07.230
And how she does
not rest on the kind

01:05:07.230 --> 01:05:11.820
of diagnostic observational
mode of writing

01:05:11.820 --> 01:05:15.600
but is constantly
pushing into action.

01:05:15.600 --> 01:05:19.670
A lot of her essays will break
into bullet points of here

01:05:19.670 --> 01:05:21.480
is what I did next.

01:05:21.480 --> 01:05:24.330
Here are the actions that
we undertook as students

01:05:24.330 --> 01:05:26.130
organizing against something.

01:05:26.130 --> 01:05:29.670
Here is what my breast cancer
means to me in my daily life.

01:05:29.670 --> 01:05:33.830
And you have the sense
always of a presence that

01:05:33.830 --> 01:05:37.560
is invested not just in
your intellect and your mind

01:05:37.560 --> 01:05:39.960
and your curiosity
but your very life.

01:05:39.960 --> 01:05:40.770
You know?

01:05:40.770 --> 01:05:46.290
And so to be able to teach her
as a writer that can model that

01:05:46.290 --> 01:05:49.950
and what it might mean to
write activism into your work

01:05:49.950 --> 01:05:55.140
creatively without losing
sight of the emotional visceral

01:05:55.140 --> 01:05:58.410
intelligence that's really
driving the work, I think is--

01:05:58.410 --> 01:06:00.900
I mean, she's a rare
gift in that way

01:06:00.900 --> 01:06:04.482
of allowing for that
conversation to unfold.

01:06:04.482 --> 01:06:04.982
- All right.

01:06:08.180 --> 01:06:08.680
All right.

01:06:08.680 --> 01:06:11.220
We're going to keep going in
case anyone has questions.

01:06:11.220 --> 01:06:13.440
The microphone is open.

01:06:13.440 --> 01:06:18.182
So can we talk a bit more, then,
about June as an organizer?

01:06:18.182 --> 01:06:20.640
Because here I'm thinking, too,
about Poetry for the People

01:06:20.640 --> 01:06:22.950
and how it becomes the
embodiment of a certain kind

01:06:22.950 --> 01:06:24.000
of philosophical vision.

01:06:24.000 --> 01:06:27.500
That for her, the
people is capacious.

01:06:27.500 --> 01:06:30.090
It's transethnic,
transracial, and it crosses

01:06:30.090 --> 01:06:31.640
all these different boundaries.

01:06:31.640 --> 01:06:33.473
And so I'm wondering
if you could each speak

01:06:33.473 --> 01:06:35.580
a bit about sort of
the greatest lesson

01:06:35.580 --> 01:06:37.500
that June has given
you in that regard,

01:06:37.500 --> 01:06:40.440
in terms of how is she opening
the way that you're thinking

01:06:40.440 --> 01:06:43.260
about the collaboration
between arts and politics

01:06:43.260 --> 01:06:46.596
or arts and events organizing
or even arts in the classroom.

01:06:51.530 --> 01:06:54.550
- I'll say, a thing that
stands out to me about Poetry

01:06:54.550 --> 01:07:00.900
for the People always is,
shortly after the first Gulf

01:07:00.900 --> 01:07:04.410
War broke out, June
apparently came to class--

01:07:04.410 --> 01:07:06.630
the student-teacher poet class--

01:07:06.630 --> 01:07:10.680
and dropped a translated
Quran on the table and said,

01:07:10.680 --> 01:07:12.630
you know, Arab and
Arab-American poetry

01:07:12.630 --> 01:07:16.770
is not being taught on this
campus and we need to teach it.

01:07:16.770 --> 01:07:20.760
Now there are five million
ways that that conversation

01:07:20.760 --> 01:07:22.440
could have been stopped.

01:07:22.440 --> 01:07:26.370
One, for example, the Quran
is not to be translated.

01:07:26.370 --> 01:07:28.710
The Quran is also
not necessarily

01:07:28.710 --> 01:07:30.570
the book of faith for all Arabs.

01:07:30.570 --> 01:07:36.930
You know, this move itself is so
problematic and ethically messy

01:07:36.930 --> 01:07:42.000
and dangerous in a lot of
ways that a lot of people

01:07:42.000 --> 01:07:45.430
would just stop and
prevent it from happening.

01:07:45.430 --> 01:07:50.430
And so for me, the
question is always,

01:07:50.430 --> 01:07:53.170
what is the thing
that's not happening?

01:07:53.170 --> 01:07:56.400
How do I make that thing
happen in the classroom,

01:07:56.400 --> 01:07:58.350
rather than wait
for the expert that

01:07:58.350 --> 01:08:03.122
would knowingly and respectfully
educate us all on this?

01:08:03.122 --> 01:08:04.830
Like, we acknowledge
this is a thing that

01:08:04.830 --> 01:08:08.730
is creatively and collectively
made and we have to make it

01:08:08.730 --> 01:08:11.220
and it's going to be
a messy enterprise.

01:08:11.220 --> 01:08:14.375
That's one thing I
think about quite often.

01:08:14.375 --> 01:08:15.750
And the other
thing I think about

01:08:15.750 --> 01:08:18.840
was a very difficult
conversation and position

01:08:18.840 --> 01:08:21.450
that she would push us in
in Poetry for the People

01:08:21.450 --> 01:08:24.720
as I inherited it, which
was that, for example, we

01:08:24.720 --> 01:08:28.050
had an assignment wherein
everyone in that class

01:08:28.050 --> 01:08:31.120
had to write a poem
in Black English.

01:08:31.120 --> 01:08:34.689
Now, first, we
studied Black English.

01:08:34.689 --> 01:08:39.760
We studied it as a language
with certain grammatical rules.

01:08:39.760 --> 01:08:42.760
We studied it as a
language with a history

01:08:42.760 --> 01:08:45.470
that traces back to certain
West African languages.

01:08:45.470 --> 01:08:49.420
It was broken down for us
rule by rule, historically.

01:08:49.420 --> 01:08:52.149
And the argument that
she was giving us was,

01:08:52.149 --> 01:08:55.960
either you accept that
Black English is a language

01:08:55.960 --> 01:09:00.130
and as such should be
learned and can be learned,

01:09:00.130 --> 01:09:02.479
or you don't.

01:09:02.479 --> 01:09:03.760
And why is it--

01:09:03.760 --> 01:09:07.779
on the other side of that,
why is it that some of us

01:09:07.779 --> 01:09:11.260
are forced into a
King's English--

01:09:11.260 --> 01:09:14.890
into that discomfort--
and never have

01:09:14.890 --> 01:09:18.260
to experience any
comparable discomfort?

01:09:18.260 --> 01:09:19.450
Right?

01:09:19.450 --> 01:09:22.300
That workshop was always a mess.

01:09:22.300 --> 01:09:27.160
Who am I in the end to workshop
somebody's poem in Black

01:09:27.160 --> 01:09:30.100
English if it's violating
the rules as it's laid down

01:09:30.100 --> 01:09:32.762
for me but is the Black
English that they grew up with

01:09:32.762 --> 01:09:33.970
and they know and they speak?

01:09:33.970 --> 01:09:34.600
Right?

01:09:34.600 --> 01:09:41.560
So it was always a firestorm to
kind of walk into, and for me,

01:09:41.560 --> 01:09:48.260
that sense of feeling
threatened to your core

01:09:48.260 --> 01:09:53.510
is the sense that she constantly
pushes me toward in teaching

01:09:53.510 --> 01:09:55.660
and in her poetry and in
the classroom and beyond.

01:10:01.130 --> 01:10:05.270
- So June Jordan--

01:10:05.270 --> 01:10:07.490
I mean, there's a
way in which she's

01:10:07.490 --> 01:10:10.600
connected to the foundation
of black studies, which

01:10:10.600 --> 01:10:13.476
was explicitly--

01:10:13.476 --> 01:10:15.350
it's going to take me
a little bit roundabout

01:10:15.350 --> 01:10:17.390
way to get to here.

01:10:17.390 --> 01:10:20.720
Was explicitly
political at the outset.

01:10:20.720 --> 01:10:23.280
That it was connected to--

01:10:23.280 --> 01:10:25.670
at least in the terms
of higher education,

01:10:25.670 --> 01:10:30.350
that black studies was connected
to the freedom movement.

01:10:30.350 --> 01:10:32.960
And then there is
this transition

01:10:32.960 --> 01:10:36.800
that happens in the '80s and
more and more intensively

01:10:36.800 --> 01:10:39.740
in the 1990s,
where, in the quest

01:10:39.740 --> 01:10:42.590
to seek kind of real
academic legitimacy,

01:10:42.590 --> 01:10:46.310
that deep politicization
of black studies

01:10:46.310 --> 01:10:49.910
was undertaken so that it wasn't
treated simply as, OK, these

01:10:49.910 --> 01:10:52.520
are the courses we have to have
so the black kids don't take

01:10:52.520 --> 01:10:53.690
over the president's office.

01:10:53.690 --> 01:10:56.060
Right?

01:10:56.060 --> 01:11:02.630
And her lesson around--

01:11:02.630 --> 01:11:09.890
she's really refusing to take
the politics out of the work

01:11:09.890 --> 01:11:13.100
because it is political
work, whether or not

01:11:13.100 --> 01:11:13.970
you acknowledge it.

01:11:13.970 --> 01:11:18.530
I mean, I think the Black
English example is perfect.

01:11:18.530 --> 01:11:22.852
And for me, when I' teaching
Black English within an Intro

01:11:22.852 --> 01:11:25.340
to African-American Studies
course, it winds up,

01:11:25.340 --> 01:11:29.490
even in that instance, being
a firestorm because it is--

01:11:29.490 --> 01:11:32.960
I mean, there is such
deep feelings of anxiety

01:11:32.960 --> 01:11:36.500
but also conceptions of
fundamental illegitimacy

01:11:36.500 --> 01:11:39.170
to the way black people speak
that even some black students

01:11:39.170 --> 01:11:40.420
hold that it is--

01:11:40.420 --> 01:11:45.280
I mean, so when you have
things like that that are case

01:11:45.280 --> 01:11:47.960
and you know black studies
is fundamentally political.

01:11:47.960 --> 01:11:54.410
And so for her to spend a career
embracing that as a truth,

01:11:54.410 --> 01:11:57.830
I think it is for me
an important lesson,

01:11:57.830 --> 01:12:00.740
not just because of my
politics but because I

01:12:00.740 --> 01:12:05.420
want to be a rigorous
scholar and a good teacher.

01:12:05.420 --> 01:12:07.007
And then I see the other piece--

01:12:07.007 --> 01:12:08.090
you know, there's always--

01:12:08.090 --> 01:12:16.190
so there's this perennial
accusation about politics

01:12:16.190 --> 01:12:21.200
and art, and so that somehow
makes it sort of less likely

01:12:21.200 --> 01:12:26.240
to be good art, but I also think
that what she is a testimony to

01:12:26.240 --> 01:12:29.570
is politics as art.

01:12:29.570 --> 01:12:34.550
So that the crafting of one's
life and the seeking of beauty

01:12:34.550 --> 01:12:36.770
that is political work.

01:12:36.770 --> 01:12:41.330
And so that kind of, for me,
that turning it on its head

01:12:41.330 --> 01:12:45.580
also sort of gets
away from the kind

01:12:45.580 --> 01:12:50.330
of set ideas of what you have
to do in the freedom struggle as

01:12:50.330 --> 01:12:53.300
opposed to thinking
about how we can

01:12:53.300 --> 01:12:55.032
be experimental and creative.

01:12:55.032 --> 01:12:56.990
And so I think that's
another instance in which

01:12:56.990 --> 01:12:59.540
what she's done as an educator.

01:12:59.540 --> 01:13:02.750
How do you exist
in the university

01:13:02.750 --> 01:13:04.850
with politics directed
towards liberation.

01:13:04.850 --> 01:13:07.055
Those kinds of-- she's a model.

01:13:09.384 --> 01:13:10.800
- Yeah, I mean, I
think picking up

01:13:10.800 --> 01:13:15.180
on Imani's last point, which is
a lesson is organized where you

01:13:15.180 --> 01:13:18.810
are, with the people who are the
community in which you actually

01:13:18.810 --> 01:13:22.870
are living, and so she thought
that by organizing on campus,

01:13:22.870 --> 01:13:25.830
which is where she spent a
hell of a lot of her time.

01:13:25.830 --> 01:13:27.180
Organizing with students.

01:13:27.180 --> 01:13:28.230
Alongside students.

01:13:28.230 --> 01:13:31.050
Whether it was building
to add a defense committee

01:13:31.050 --> 01:13:34.949
or working around the South
Africa divestment programs

01:13:34.949 --> 01:13:36.990
and being an inspiration
to the students who took

01:13:36.990 --> 01:13:39.480
that charge to actually put
their bodies on the line.

01:13:39.480 --> 01:13:40.860
And her saying,
I'll be with you,

01:13:40.860 --> 01:13:43.360
putting my body on
the line alongside,

01:13:43.360 --> 01:13:45.060
is a really important
part of what

01:13:45.060 --> 01:13:46.970
it means to be an organizer.

01:13:46.970 --> 01:13:51.450
I think there is a
difference between people who

01:13:51.450 --> 01:13:53.780
are organizers and activists.

01:13:53.780 --> 01:13:56.500
It's like, there's actually
a big difference there.

01:13:56.500 --> 01:14:00.840
And I think that it gets
very blurry for folks

01:14:00.840 --> 01:14:03.635
in the current moment, but
if you're an organizer,

01:14:03.635 --> 01:14:06.840
you're developing
leaders more than you

01:14:06.840 --> 01:14:12.540
are the person upfront on lone
ranger wearing a blue vest.

01:14:12.540 --> 01:14:16.350
But I'm just saying, like,
that is a real thing.

01:14:16.350 --> 01:14:17.340
That's a real thing.

01:14:17.340 --> 01:14:18.190
That's a real thing.

01:14:18.190 --> 01:14:20.610
There's a difference between
being an organizer tied

01:14:20.610 --> 01:14:23.550
to a community that
you're accountable to

01:14:23.550 --> 01:14:27.600
and speaking for yourself
on behalf of no one else.

01:14:27.600 --> 01:14:30.840
I think we have to be
real about those things

01:14:30.840 --> 01:14:33.060
because it's a real struggle.

01:14:33.060 --> 01:14:34.000
So that's one.

01:14:34.000 --> 01:14:36.630
I think the other issue we
really have to be mindful about

01:14:36.630 --> 01:14:39.450
is, to me, the fact
that art is absolutely

01:14:39.450 --> 01:14:40.920
necessary to social movements.

01:14:40.920 --> 01:14:43.590
In fact, that social
movements themselves

01:14:43.590 --> 01:14:48.010
are a form of
collective art making.

01:14:48.010 --> 01:14:49.410
Like, I don't think people can--

01:14:49.410 --> 01:14:51.930
I think you have to understand
that that's the case.

01:14:51.930 --> 01:14:55.320
And Jeff Chang said years
ago that cultural change

01:14:55.320 --> 01:14:57.510
precedes political change.

01:14:57.510 --> 01:14:58.590
That's right.

01:14:58.590 --> 01:15:01.250
And what can
artists do the best?

01:15:01.250 --> 01:15:06.070
Is work on culture and help
us be able to do that work.

01:15:06.070 --> 01:15:10.590
It's not that-- it's so
often you see that happening.

01:15:10.590 --> 01:15:16.620
And because the cultural
change demands imagination,

01:15:16.620 --> 01:15:20.490
and art can do a really
good job of lifting your--

01:15:20.490 --> 01:15:23.730
kind of lifting the ceiling
off your imagination.

01:15:23.730 --> 01:15:25.996
To allow you to think
of things that you never

01:15:25.996 --> 01:15:27.120
would have imagined before.

01:15:27.120 --> 01:15:32.500
And the thing that
shifted for us in Chicago,

01:15:32.500 --> 01:15:35.760
I was the co-lead organizer
of a campaign for reparations

01:15:35.760 --> 01:15:37.680
for police torture
survivors, which

01:15:37.680 --> 01:15:39.720
we won a couple of
years ago in Chicago.

01:15:39.720 --> 01:15:40.672
The first of its kind.

01:15:40.672 --> 01:15:41.171
Yeah.

01:15:41.171 --> 01:15:42.975
[APPLAUSE]

01:15:44.527 --> 01:15:46.610
And like, how did we come
to create that campaign?

01:15:46.610 --> 01:15:49.469
That campaign came
not from the law.

01:15:49.469 --> 01:15:51.260
People fought for years
and years and years

01:15:51.260 --> 01:15:53.960
to try to get the police
officers convicted.

01:15:53.960 --> 01:15:56.030
And then when one of them
finally went to trial

01:15:56.030 --> 01:15:58.220
and was convicted,
they got four years,

01:15:58.220 --> 01:16:00.980
and then all these people who
had been tortured for 20 years

01:16:00.980 --> 01:16:02.960
were left thinking, this is it?

01:16:02.960 --> 01:16:05.300
This is what we got?

01:16:05.300 --> 01:16:08.390
So the court doesn't
produce justice.

01:16:08.390 --> 01:16:11.210
The court enforces the law.

01:16:11.210 --> 01:16:12.950
That's very different.

01:16:12.950 --> 01:16:16.280
And so we were left bereft.

01:16:16.280 --> 01:16:17.510
People who didn't have money.

01:16:17.510 --> 01:16:19.280
People needed their
needs to be met.

01:16:19.280 --> 01:16:22.400
The material needs that you
need to live were unmet.

01:16:22.400 --> 01:16:23.900
People were still
having nightmares.

01:16:23.900 --> 01:16:26.470
There was no psychological
offering of services.

01:16:26.470 --> 01:16:27.530
Like, these were things.

01:16:27.530 --> 01:16:31.340
And it was through art and
an imagination of, how would

01:16:31.340 --> 01:16:32.810
we memorialize this torture?

01:16:32.810 --> 01:16:36.950
That Joey Mogul
wrote this ordinance

01:16:36.950 --> 01:16:39.830
that was this
emancipatory abolitionist

01:16:39.830 --> 01:16:44.480
document that said this is going
to be a reparations ask demand.

01:16:44.480 --> 01:16:46.140
That's what we're
going to fight on.

01:16:46.140 --> 01:16:47.723
We're going to fight
on this and we're

01:16:47.723 --> 01:16:50.840
going to ask for all sorts of
stuff that's not just money.

01:16:50.840 --> 01:16:53.700
And that was through
an art project.

01:16:53.700 --> 01:16:55.460
So that's very, very
important, I think,

01:16:55.460 --> 01:16:59.210
for people to be thinking
about on a regular basis.

01:16:59.210 --> 01:17:02.510
And one of the things
about organizing

01:17:02.510 --> 01:17:04.940
is that we're often
very reactive.

01:17:04.940 --> 01:17:05.660
By necessity.

01:17:05.660 --> 01:17:07.190
We have to be.

01:17:07.190 --> 01:17:10.340
What art does is it helps you
force you to be visionary.

01:17:10.340 --> 01:17:14.240
And that's so incredibly
necessary in organizing.

01:17:14.240 --> 01:17:18.900
So I think that she knew those
things and tried to live them.

01:17:18.900 --> 01:17:21.050
And didn't always live up to it.

01:17:21.050 --> 01:17:24.810
I think was honest about that.

01:17:24.810 --> 01:17:27.080
So I think those are
some of the things that

01:17:27.080 --> 01:17:29.540
come to mind as I think
about, like, lessons to learn

01:17:29.540 --> 01:17:32.840
from the work, and that
work being the art that

01:17:32.840 --> 01:17:36.080
allows for the foundation
from which we can actually

01:17:36.080 --> 01:17:38.394
fight and win.

01:17:38.394 --> 01:17:39.260
- Yeah.

01:17:39.260 --> 01:17:41.890
That's beautiful.

01:17:41.890 --> 01:17:44.160
I think we have
our first question.

01:17:44.160 --> 01:17:46.390
Nice.

01:17:46.390 --> 01:17:49.990
- First of all, thank
you to everybody

01:17:49.990 --> 01:17:52.786
who made this event possible.

01:17:52.786 --> 01:17:56.490
Excuse me because I'm a
novice to June Jordan.

01:17:56.490 --> 01:17:58.755
I saw this event online
and I was like, all right,

01:17:58.755 --> 01:18:00.770
this seems like something to do.

01:18:00.770 --> 01:18:05.240
And so, as a novice, I'm
taking all the information that

01:18:05.240 --> 01:18:08.770
y'all are putting out.

01:18:08.770 --> 01:18:12.490
Can you tell me what kind of--

01:18:12.490 --> 01:18:15.130
not just a lesson,
per se, but what's

01:18:15.130 --> 01:18:19.270
the favorite thing or aspect
characteristic about June

01:18:19.270 --> 01:18:22.000
Jordan that you would
like to impress upon folks

01:18:22.000 --> 01:18:28.030
like myself who are a novice to
her work and her living legacy?

01:18:28.030 --> 01:18:29.920
So what was really
that characteristic--

01:18:29.920 --> 01:18:31.420
or doesn't have to
be the one thing,

01:18:31.420 --> 01:18:32.950
of course, but what
would you would

01:18:32.950 --> 01:18:37.040
like to impress upon those
who don't know as much

01:18:37.040 --> 01:18:40.570
but can clearly see by
Radcliffe doing this that she

01:18:40.570 --> 01:18:42.560
did something real good.

01:18:42.560 --> 01:18:44.468
So appreciate y'all.

01:18:44.468 --> 01:18:45.902
- Oh, thank you.

01:18:45.902 --> 01:18:47.814
[APPLAUSE]

01:18:51.037 --> 01:18:53.120
Well, I mean, just for me,
she took very seriously

01:18:53.120 --> 01:18:54.800
the voices of children.

01:18:54.800 --> 01:18:58.040
I think that was a central
component of Jordan's ethos.

01:18:58.040 --> 01:18:58.610
Her writing.

01:18:58.610 --> 01:19:01.470
Her thinking that children
had their own culture.

01:19:01.470 --> 01:19:02.240
Their own ideas.

01:19:02.240 --> 01:19:05.010
And that part of why the world
hates children, she writes,

01:19:05.010 --> 01:19:07.970
is that they remind us of the
vulnerability in ourselves.

01:19:07.970 --> 01:19:11.300
And so for me, reading her
work first in grad school--

01:19:11.300 --> 01:19:12.892
"The Future Life
of Willy Jordan"

01:19:12.892 --> 01:19:14.600
was that first essay
that I came across--

01:19:14.600 --> 01:19:16.730
and it just struck me
that someone would ground

01:19:16.730 --> 01:19:18.710
so much of their thinking
in that experience--

01:19:18.710 --> 01:19:20.376
the idea that young
people had something

01:19:20.376 --> 01:19:21.750
valuable to contribute.

01:19:21.750 --> 01:19:24.080
So I think that that
was my one major lesson

01:19:24.080 --> 01:19:26.660
and that sort of
spurred my desire

01:19:26.660 --> 01:19:29.580
to constantly be thinking of
Jordan for the rest of my life.

01:19:33.050 --> 01:19:40.620
- It's hard to say, but I would
say her laughter, actually.

01:19:40.620 --> 01:19:43.630
And if you could
listen to her laughter.

01:19:43.630 --> 01:19:46.000
And also, the humor
that she brings

01:19:46.000 --> 01:19:49.510
to her work in the most
difficult-- and it's scathing.

01:19:49.510 --> 01:19:50.710
It's snarling.

01:19:50.710 --> 01:19:51.890
It's tender.

01:19:51.890 --> 01:19:58.510
It's just so dexterous
and nimble and necessary,

01:19:58.510 --> 01:20:01.000
I think, to the work--
the very difficult work--

01:20:01.000 --> 01:20:03.163
that she was doing and after.

01:20:08.940 --> 01:20:15.640
- She loved black people
unapologetically and overtly

01:20:15.640 --> 01:20:16.140
and deeply.

01:20:18.990 --> 01:20:27.830
And that shouldn't be
surprising, but in some ways,

01:20:27.830 --> 01:20:30.650
it is, given the landscape.

01:20:30.650 --> 01:20:36.650
And that that actually is the
grounds out of which she has--

01:20:36.650 --> 01:20:41.190
I mean, she has an
international politics

01:20:41.190 --> 01:20:49.280
that moves across categories of
identity and immigration status

01:20:49.280 --> 01:20:53.510
and location and
social position.

01:20:53.510 --> 01:20:59.510
But that as a grounds
to me is so important

01:20:59.510 --> 01:21:02.690
but also inspiring.

01:21:02.690 --> 01:21:07.010
And it's one of those things
that's like a guide, right?

01:21:10.460 --> 01:21:11.910
- I think two things for me.

01:21:11.910 --> 01:21:14.090
I always loved her
righteous outrage.

01:21:14.090 --> 01:21:18.790
Like, if you read her, she's
like, this is fucked up.

01:21:18.790 --> 01:21:19.790
Do you know what I mean?

01:21:19.790 --> 01:21:21.660
And that's, like, so refreshing.

01:21:21.660 --> 01:21:25.080
It's not like, you
know, things are harsh

01:21:25.080 --> 01:21:26.351
and oppression exists.

01:21:26.351 --> 01:21:26.850
You know?

01:21:26.850 --> 01:21:27.950
Like, it's like, this sucks.

01:21:27.950 --> 01:21:28.225
You know?

01:21:28.225 --> 01:21:28.725
- Yeah.

01:21:28.725 --> 01:21:29.750
For sure.

01:21:29.750 --> 01:21:33.120
- I really loved that and
that was what drew me to her.

01:21:33.120 --> 01:21:38.400
Like, I think it was my
feminist philosophy professor,

01:21:38.400 --> 01:21:40.230
Peta Tancred out
of McGill who first

01:21:40.230 --> 01:21:42.950
introduced her writing to us.

01:21:42.950 --> 01:21:45.080
This was the late '80s.

01:21:45.080 --> 01:21:47.020
And we were just
all like, oh my god,

01:21:47.020 --> 01:21:48.906
like, we totally relate to her.

01:21:48.906 --> 01:21:50.280
And then I think
the second thing

01:21:50.280 --> 01:21:54.780
is that she embraced
being difficult.

01:21:54.780 --> 01:21:59.040
I mean, for black women,
when you are supposed

01:21:59.040 --> 01:22:02.100
to make yourself small
all the time in order

01:22:02.100 --> 01:22:06.890
not to get your head
blown off by everybody--

01:22:06.890 --> 01:22:10.360
like literally, you're swiveling
like trying not to get shot

01:22:10.360 --> 01:22:13.130
in all different directions,
both figuratively

01:22:13.130 --> 01:22:15.974
and literally, I think
that she embraced that.

01:22:15.974 --> 01:22:18.390
Like, she would just be like,
somebody would interview her

01:22:18.390 --> 01:22:20.870
and they would say, we really
see your work as blase.

01:22:20.870 --> 01:22:25.071
And she'd say, nope, that's
not what I was thinking.

01:22:25.071 --> 01:22:26.070
Do you know what I mean?

01:22:26.070 --> 01:22:27.845
Like, that ain't
it, so I don't know

01:22:27.845 --> 01:22:28.970
what you're thinking about.

01:22:28.970 --> 01:22:29.970
Do you know what I mean?

01:22:29.970 --> 01:22:31.470
And like, she would
just push back

01:22:31.470 --> 01:22:34.380
in that kind of way, which
people termed difficult

01:22:34.380 --> 01:22:38.200
because they just don't
want you to speak back.

01:22:38.200 --> 01:22:39.240
Do you know what I mean?

01:22:39.240 --> 01:22:40.790
They just want you to take it.

01:22:40.790 --> 01:22:43.620
So I love those two
things about her,

01:22:43.620 --> 01:22:45.915
and I think if you
read more of her work--

01:22:45.915 --> 01:22:46.980
- Which I will.

01:22:46.980 --> 01:22:48.632
- --you totally get to it.

01:22:48.632 --> 01:22:50.340
You're going to love
the fact that that's

01:22:50.340 --> 01:22:51.720
like, you know, fuck this.

01:22:51.720 --> 01:22:52.890
And it's great.

01:22:52.890 --> 01:22:53.740
You know?

01:22:53.740 --> 01:22:54.240
Yeah.

01:22:54.240 --> 01:22:55.198
- Appreciate everybody.

01:22:55.198 --> 01:22:56.300
Thank y'all.

01:22:56.300 --> 01:22:57.800
[APPLAUSE]

01:22:57.800 --> 01:23:01.150
