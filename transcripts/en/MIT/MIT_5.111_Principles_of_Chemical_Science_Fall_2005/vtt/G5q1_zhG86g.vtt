00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:13.038
We are going to start with the
lecture notes from last Friday

00:00:13.038 --> 00:00:17.908
because I didn't finish them.
What we were doing at the end

00:00:17.908 --> 00:00:22.274
of lecture last time was
probably some of the hardest

00:00:22.274 --> 00:00:26.389
concepts that we've covered so
far in this course,

00:00:26.389 --> 00:00:30.000
and maybe even in the whole
course.

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:36.525
And you will remember that we
finally got around to talking

00:00:36.525 --> 00:00:43.387
about what does a wave function
mean, and how does it actually

00:00:43.387 --> 00:00:48.225
represent the electron in our
hydrogen atom.

00:00:48.225 --> 00:00:54.862
And we saw that the physically
significant interpretation of

00:00:54.862 --> 00:01:00.600
the wave function was not
actually the wave function

00:01:00.600 --> 00:01:06.000
itself, but the wave function
squared.

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:08.924
So psi here,
which we learned,

00:01:08.924 --> 00:01:13.159
has to be labeled by three
quantum numbers,

00:01:13.159 --> 00:01:17.394
n, l and m.
And that is a function of three

00:01:17.394 --> 00:01:21.025
position variables,
r, theta and phi.

00:01:21.025 --> 00:01:25.966
If you square that,
the physical interpretation of

00:01:25.966 --> 00:01:30.000
that is a probability density.

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:39.653
This means this has units.
This has units of inverse

00:01:39.653 --> 00:01:42.756
volume.
It's a probability per unit

00:01:42.756 --> 00:01:45.494
volume.
That is very important.

00:01:45.494 --> 00:01:49.965
It's not a probability,
but a probability per unit

00:01:49.965 --> 00:01:53.342
volume.
But the other quantity that we

00:01:53.342 --> 00:01:59.000
would like to know something
about is a probability.

00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:04.406
We would like to know something
about how far is the electron

00:02:04.406 --> 00:02:08.191
from the nucleus.
And, in order to do that,

00:02:08.191 --> 00:02:11.526
we needed to invoke this
concept here,

00:02:11.526 --> 00:02:15.581
this radial probability
distribution function.

00:02:15.581 --> 00:02:20.988
And what we said it was last
time is a probability of finding

00:02:20.988 --> 00:02:26.665
an electron in a spherical shell
of radius r, and that spherical

00:02:26.665 --> 00:02:33.086
shell has a thickness dr.
Or, another way to say it is

00:02:33.086 --> 00:02:38.929
that it's the probability of
finding the electron at a

00:02:38.929 --> 00:02:45.433
distance between r to r plus dr.
This is a probability here.

00:02:45.433 --> 00:02:50.283
And we illustrated that in the
following way.

00:02:50.283 --> 00:02:56.125
This gray portion here,
well, that was our dot density

00:02:56.125 --> 00:03:00.272
diagram.
That gray portion was the

00:03:00.272 --> 00:03:03.181
probability density,
psi squared.

00:03:03.181 --> 00:03:07.909
In this particular case,
the (1, 0, 0) wave function,

00:03:07.909 --> 00:03:11.090
the 1s wave function,
we squared it.

00:03:11.090 --> 00:03:16.181
And then we represented the
magnitude of that by that dot

00:03:16.181 --> 00:03:21.272
density diagram or the density
of the dots where that was

00:03:21.272 --> 00:03:24.545
highest.
That represented the highest

00:03:24.545 --> 00:03:28.272
value of psi squared.
And then it radially

00:03:28.272 --> 00:03:34.370
dissipated, exponentially.
That is what that gray dot

00:03:34.370 --> 00:03:39.019
density diagram was.
And now, if we take a spherical

00:03:39.019 --> 00:03:44.488
shell and we put it right at the
origin where our nucleus is,

00:03:44.488 --> 00:03:49.685
and that spherical shell has a
radius r, and since it is a

00:03:49.685 --> 00:03:54.698
shell, it is infinitesimally
thin, it has a thickness dr

00:03:54.698 --> 00:04:00.350
here, the probability of finding
the electron in that spherical

00:04:00.350 --> 00:04:05.000
shell is what the radial
probability is.

00:04:05.000 --> 00:04:08.467
So it's going to be able to
tell us how far,

00:04:08.467 --> 00:04:13.064
or the probability of finding
the electron between r and r

00:04:13.064 --> 00:04:15.967
plus dr.
Now, how do we calculate the

00:04:15.967 --> 00:04:20.645
radial probability distribution,
or how do we calculate the

00:04:20.645 --> 00:04:24.596
radial probability?
Well, the first thing you have

00:04:24.596 --> 00:04:30.000
to realize is what the volume of
this spherical shell is.

00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:35.437
The volume of this spherical
shell is just the surface area

00:04:35.437 --> 00:04:38.156
of the sphere,
4 pi r squared,

00:04:38.156 --> 00:04:43.125
times the thickness dr.
That's the

00:04:43.125 --> 00:04:48.843
volume of the spherical shell.
Now, what can I do to calculate

00:04:48.843 --> 00:04:53.812
the radial probability?
Well, we know that psi squared

00:04:53.812 --> 00:05:00.000
is the probability density,
probability per unit volume.

00:05:00.000 --> 00:05:04.719
If I multiply it by that unit
volume, in this case 4 pi r

00:05:04.719 --> 00:05:09.269
squared dr,
the volumes here cancel and we

00:05:09.269 --> 00:05:13.398
have a probability.
That's our radial probability.

00:05:13.398 --> 00:05:17.443
And this is strictly correct
for s-orbitals only.

00:05:17.443 --> 00:05:22.078
There is a little difference
here for the p-orbitals and

00:05:22.078 --> 00:05:25.533
d-orbitals.
We're actually not going to do

00:05:25.533 --> 00:05:30.000
that, but this is our radial
probability.

00:05:30.000 --> 00:05:35.802
Let's take an example.
Let's look at an example of the

00:05:35.802 --> 00:05:39.635
radial probability for the 1s
state.

00:05:39.635 --> 00:05:45.547
What have we done here to
calculate radial probability?

00:05:45.547 --> 00:05:51.459
We've taken psi squared.
We've squared 1s wave function

00:05:51.459 --> 00:05:58.357
and have multiplied it by 4 pi r
squared dr for all these values

00:05:58.357 --> 00:06:02.476
of r.
We've calculated psi at all the

00:06:02.476 --> 00:06:07.269
values of r and multiplied it by
4 pi r squared dr.

00:06:07.269 --> 00:06:09.986
And the result is this radial

00:06:09.986 --> 00:06:13.341
probability.
That's what I'm plotting right

00:06:13.341 --> 00:06:15.019
here.
What do you see?

00:06:15.019 --> 00:06:19.013
Well, the first thing you see
is that the electron,

00:06:19.013 --> 00:06:23.647
the most probable value of r,
or the most probable distance

00:06:23.647 --> 00:06:29.000
of the electron from the
nucleus, is quite a ways out.

00:06:29.000 --> 00:06:33.826
That most probable value is all
the way out here,

00:06:33.826 --> 00:06:37.748
where r is equal to a nought.

00:06:37.748 --> 00:06:43.078
And I said last time that this
a nought is a constant.

00:06:43.078 --> 00:06:49.011
It's called the Bohr radius.
And today I will explain why it

00:06:49.011 --> 00:06:53.938
is called the Bohr radius.
It has a value of 0.529

00:06:53.938 --> 00:06:57.759
angstroms.
So it is most likely to find

00:06:57.759 --> 00:07:05.000
the electron about a half an
angstrom away from the nucleus.

00:07:05.000 --> 00:07:10.756
The most probable value,
or the most probable position

00:07:10.756 --> 00:07:15.644
of finding the electron is not
at the nucleus.

00:07:15.644 --> 00:07:18.468
And, in fact,
look at this,

00:07:18.468 --> 00:07:25.202
that radial probability here is
actually zero at r equals zero.

00:07:25.202 --> 00:07:30.741
That seems a little strange
because we looked at the

00:07:30.741 --> 00:07:35.957
probability density.
Remember we plotted the

00:07:35.957 --> 00:07:40.978
probability density the last
time which was just psi squared

00:07:40.978 --> 00:07:45.063
for the (1,0,0) wave function as
a function of r.

00:07:45.063 --> 00:07:49.319
And, when we did that,
we saw that at r equals zero

00:07:49.319 --> 00:07:54.510
here, the probability density
was some large maximum value and

00:07:54.510 --> 00:08:00.729
that this exponentially decayed.
Well, the probability density

00:08:00.729 --> 00:08:06.470
is a large maximum value at r
equals zero, but when we look at

00:08:06.470 --> 00:08:11.176
the radial probability,
it's zero at r equals zero.

00:08:11.176 --> 00:08:14.094
Why?
Well, because when we go to

00:08:14.094 --> 00:08:19.270
calculate the radial probability
we are multiplying that

00:08:19.270 --> 00:08:25.011
probability density by a sphere,
a sphere whose volume now has

00:08:25.011 --> 00:08:30.000
shrunk to zero because r is
equal to zero.

00:08:30.000 --> 00:08:35.353
So the probability of finding
that electron right at the

00:08:35.353 --> 00:08:40.318
nucleus between r equals zero
and r plus dr is zero.

00:08:40.318 --> 00:08:46.159
So the most likely distance of
that electron and the hydrogen

00:08:46.159 --> 00:08:50.053
atom from the nucleus is one
Bohr radius.

00:08:50.053 --> 00:08:55.991
Actually, then the diameter of
that hydrogen atom we typically

00:08:55.991 --> 00:09:03.000
say is twice the Bohr radius or
a little bit over an angstrom.

00:09:03.000 --> 00:09:07.937
So that's what a radial
probability distribution

00:09:07.937 --> 00:09:12.140
function means.
It's going to tell us the

00:09:12.140 --> 00:09:18.233
probability of finding the
electron a certain distance r to

00:09:18.233 --> 00:09:22.120
r plus dr from the nucleus.
All right.

00:09:22.120 --> 00:09:28.424
Now I want to explain to you
where this a nought comes

00:09:28.424 --> 00:09:32.803
from.
And that allows me then to also

00:09:32.803 --> 00:09:38.319
explain a very important concept
here about quantum mechanics.

00:09:38.319 --> 00:09:43.835
By 1911, both the electron and
the nucleus had been discovered

00:09:43.835 --> 00:09:48.989
and scientists were trying very
hard to understand how the

00:09:48.989 --> 00:09:52.425
electron and the nucleus hung
together.

00:09:52.425 --> 00:09:57.308
And it wasn't really until
1926, when SchrÃ¶dinger wrote

00:09:57.308 --> 00:10:01.829
down his wave equation,
that things really began to

00:10:01.829 --> 00:10:06.729
make sense.
But there were many attempts in

00:10:06.729 --> 00:10:11.308
between 1911 and 1926 to
understand what was going on

00:10:11.308 --> 00:10:15.886
with the hydrogen atom.
And one of those attempts was

00:10:15.886 --> 00:10:18.000
made by Niels Bohr.

00:10:30.000 --> 00:10:35.348
And what Bohr said was well,
I know this classical physics

00:10:35.348 --> 00:10:40.885
predicts that this electron will
plummet into the nucleus in

00:10:40.885 --> 00:10:45.108
10^-10 seconds.
That is, if I take a planetary

00:10:45.108 --> 00:10:51.020
model, I put the nucleus in the
center and I give the electron a

00:10:51.020 --> 00:10:54.961
uniform circular orbit around
that nucleus,

00:10:54.961 --> 00:11:00.029
well, I know classical physics
tells me this won't hang

00:11:00.029 --> 00:11:04.615
together.
But let me ignore that and let

00:11:04.615 --> 00:11:09.237
me propose that there is
something quantized about the

00:11:09.237 --> 00:11:12.811
hydrogen atom.
And he knew that because he

00:11:12.811 --> 00:11:18.043
knew the hydrogen atom spectrum.
He knew that in the hydrogen

00:11:18.043 --> 00:11:22.490
atom spectrum that light was
emitted at only certain

00:11:22.490 --> 00:11:25.629
frequencies, as we saw the other
day.

00:11:25.629 --> 00:11:30.773
And that gave him the idea that
there is something quantized

00:11:30.773 --> 00:11:35.877
about the hydrogen atom.
So he then proposed,

00:11:35.877 --> 00:11:41.322
let me go and I'm going to
quantize the angular momentum of

00:11:41.322 --> 00:11:45.922
that electron going around in
this circular orbit.

00:11:45.922 --> 00:11:51.367
So what he did was he kind of
took a classical model and he

00:11:51.367 --> 00:11:57.000
pasted some quantum mechanical
ideas onto the system.

00:11:57.000 --> 00:12:01.965
And when he did that the value
for r here, at which the

00:12:01.965 --> 00:12:05.919
electron was going around the
nucleus, well,

00:12:05.919 --> 00:12:11.068
that value of r ended up being
what we call here the Bohr

00:12:11.068 --> 00:12:15.206
radius now, this value of a
nought.

00:12:15.206 --> 00:12:20.264
Now, we're not going to study
the Bohr atom because it's

00:12:20.264 --> 00:12:22.563
wrong.
And, in particular,

00:12:22.563 --> 00:12:29.000
what it gets wrong is the
radial probability distribution.

00:12:29.000 --> 00:12:33.737
Here is the radial probability
distribution function as it

00:12:33.737 --> 00:12:37.975
comes out of solving the
SchrÃ¶dinger equation for an

00:12:37.975 --> 00:12:41.965
electron in this 1s state.
But here is the radial

00:12:41.965 --> 00:12:46.453
probability distribution
function for what's called the

00:12:46.453 --> 00:12:49.195
Bohr atom.
The radial probability,

00:12:49.195 --> 00:12:53.932
I will just write it as RPD.
The RPD here is going to be a

00:12:53.932 --> 00:13:00.000
whopping one right at r equals a
nought.

00:13:00.000 --> 00:13:05.378
That's the radial probability
distribution for the Bohr atom.

00:13:05.378 --> 00:13:10.666
What that tells us is we know
exactly where the electron is.

00:13:10.666 --> 00:13:16.044
What that tells us is that we
know exactly that the radius of

00:13:16.044 --> 00:13:20.974
that electron in that circular
orbit is a nought.

00:13:20.974 --> 00:13:24.918
This is what we call a
deterministic picture.

00:13:24.918 --> 00:13:30.296
That is we know exactly where
the electron is in terms of its

00:13:30.296 --> 00:13:34.822
radius.
However, we now know that

00:13:34.822 --> 00:13:41.709
what's really going on is that
we don't know exactly where the

00:13:41.709 --> 00:13:46.564
electron is.
We cannot tell you exactly what

00:13:46.564 --> 00:13:51.419
the radius is.
The best we can tell you is a

00:13:51.419 --> 00:13:57.854
probability of finding the
electron within some value r to

00:13:57.854 --> 00:14:01.471
r plus dr.
Quantum mechanics,

00:14:01.471 --> 00:14:06.133
this is a quantum mechanical
result, is non-deterministic.

00:14:06.133 --> 00:14:11.285
We are limited in the precision
with which we can tell you where

00:14:11.285 --> 00:14:15.782
something is like the electron.
We're limited within the

00:14:15.782 --> 00:14:19.871
uncertainty principle.
The uncertainty principle is

00:14:19.871 --> 00:14:24.123
not something that we're going
to be discussing here,

00:14:24.123 --> 00:14:29.112
but the uncertainty principle
does give us a limit to which we

00:14:29.112 --> 00:14:32.628
can know the position and the
momentum, say,

00:14:32.628 --> 00:14:37.533
of a particle.
So that's really the big point

00:14:37.533 --> 00:14:42.685
here, is that quantum mechanics,
the best it can do for you is

00:14:42.685 --> 00:14:47.415
to give you a probability of
finding the electron at some

00:14:47.415 --> 00:14:49.864
position.
Classical mechanics,

00:14:49.864 --> 00:14:55.101
which was really this Bohr atom
approach, will tell you exactly

00:14:55.101 --> 00:15:00.000
where something is,
but not in quantum mechanics.

00:15:00.000 --> 00:15:03.870
A very important difference
here.

00:15:03.870 --> 00:15:05.564
Questions?
Yes?

00:15:05.564 --> 00:15:13.064
Well, it does turn out that if
you go to take this distribution

00:15:13.064 --> 00:15:18.870
function and you actually look
at the value of r,

00:15:18.870 --> 00:15:25.887
at which this is a maximum,
it comes out to be exactly that

00:15:25.887 --> 00:15:32.251
number, a nought.
There actually is more to the

00:15:32.251 --> 00:15:36.910
story in the sense that that is
an accident of the particular

00:15:36.910 --> 00:15:41.491
form of the Coulomb potential
that Bohr was able to get this

00:15:41.491 --> 00:15:45.141
value a nought.
So this value really is a

00:15:45.141 --> 00:15:47.625
nought, that most probable
value.

00:15:47.625 --> 00:15:52.284
And so you saw we wrote all of
our wave functions in terms of

00:15:52.284 --> 00:15:55.934
that constant a nought.
So certainly Bohr made a

00:15:55.934 --> 00:15:59.195
contribution.
He realized there's something

00:15:59.195 --> 00:16:03.000
quantized about the hydrogen
atom.

00:16:03.000 --> 00:16:06.965
But, in order to get that,
he kind of pasted the idea of

00:16:06.965 --> 00:16:09.344
quantization on a classical
model.

00:16:09.344 --> 00:16:12.083
In contrast,
in SchrÃ¶dinger's equation,

00:16:12.083 --> 00:16:15.327
when we solve it,
we talked about how when you

00:16:15.327 --> 00:16:19.220
have a differential equation you
have to apply boundary

00:16:19.220 --> 00:16:22.825
conditions to the problem.
Well, when you apply the

00:16:22.825 --> 00:16:27.151
appropriate boundary conditions
the quantum numbers drop out.

00:16:27.151 --> 00:16:31.693
You're not doing an ad hoc kind
of pasting of quantization ideas

00:16:31.693 --> 00:16:36.008
onto some model.
Other questions?

00:16:36.008 --> 00:16:39.773
All right.
So that's the radial

00:16:39.773 --> 00:16:45.797
probability distribution
function for the 1s wave

00:16:45.797 --> 00:16:50.692
function.
But we would also like to look

00:16:50.692 --> 00:16:57.469
at the radial probability
distribution function for the

00:16:57.469 --> 00:17:05.000
other s wave functions that
we've looked at so far.

00:17:05.000 --> 00:17:10.518
And let me go over here.
The next one we're going to

00:17:10.518 --> 00:17:14.305
look at is for the 2s wave
function.

00:17:14.305 --> 00:17:19.391
This will be the radial
probability distribution

00:17:19.391 --> 00:17:22.962
function for the 2s wave
function.

00:17:22.962 --> 00:17:26.750
This is versus r.
And, if I plot it,

00:17:26.750 --> 00:17:34.000
what I am going to see is
something that looks like this.

00:17:34.000 --> 00:17:41.812
Lo and behold,
the most probable value here of

00:17:41.812 --> 00:17:47.715
r, r(mp).
This most probable value,

00:17:47.715 --> 00:17:56.395
let me get my chalk,
is actually 6 a nought.

00:17:56.395 --> 00:18:01.309
It is most likely for the

00:18:01.309 --> 00:18:07.221
electron in a 2s state to be six
times as far from the nucleus as

00:18:07.221 --> 00:18:11.378
it is in the 1s state.
That is what the radial

00:18:11.378 --> 00:18:15.258
probability distribution
function tells us.

00:18:15.258 --> 00:18:20.616
So if you have a hydrogen atom
that is in the first excited

00:18:20.616 --> 00:18:25.050
state, that hydrogen atom,
in a sense, is bigger.

00:18:25.050 --> 00:18:30.408
It's bigger in the sense that
it is more likely to find the

00:18:30.408 --> 00:18:36.228
electron a further distance from
the nucleus than it is in the n

00:18:36.228 --> 00:18:41.327
equals 1 state.
The other interesting thing

00:18:41.327 --> 00:18:45.982
here about this radial
probability distribution is that

00:18:45.982 --> 00:18:49.086
you can see where the radial
node is.

00:18:49.086 --> 00:18:52.620
We talked about the radial node
last time.

00:18:52.620 --> 00:18:56.068
This is r equals 2 a nought.

00:18:56.068 --> 00:19:00.810
A radial node is the value of r
that will make your wave

00:19:00.810 --> 00:19:07.313
function be equal to zero.
So that's the radial node.

00:19:07.313 --> 00:19:14.450
Now, very important here.
This r equals 0 is not a radial

00:19:14.450 --> 00:19:18.656
node.
r equals 0 is never a radial

00:19:18.656 --> 00:19:22.225
node.
This gets students into

00:19:22.225 --> 00:19:30.000
trouble, so let me emphasize
this over and over again.

00:19:30.000 --> 00:19:33.229
r equals 0 is never a radial
node.

00:19:33.229 --> 00:19:39.394
This r equals 0 right here is a
consequence of our definition of

00:19:39.394 --> 00:19:44.483
the radial probability 4 pi r
squared psi squared dr.

00:19:44.483 --> 00:19:49.278
That is
not a radial node.

00:19:49.278 --> 00:19:52.311
What about the 3s wave
function?

00:19:52.311 --> 00:19:57.107
Let's look at that.
This is the radial probability

00:19:57.107 --> 00:20:02.000
distribution for the 3s wave
function.

00:20:02.000 --> 00:20:07.322
What that distribution would
look like is something like

00:20:07.322 --> 00:20:10.806
this.
Look at where the most probable

00:20:10.806 --> 00:20:15.258
value of r is here.
This most probable value is

00:20:15.258 --> 00:20:19.322
11.468 a nought. It's

00:20:19.322 --> 00:20:25.129
about 11.5 times as far out from
the nucleus as it was in the

00:20:25.129 --> 00:20:31.480
case of the hydrogen 1s state.
So if you have a hydrogen atom

00:20:31.480 --> 00:20:35.282
in the second excited state,
in a sense, again,

00:20:35.282 --> 00:20:38.837
it is bigger.
It is bigger in the sense that

00:20:38.837 --> 00:20:43.632
it is more likely to find the
electron at a larger distance

00:20:43.632 --> 00:20:46.855
from the nucleus.
And, again, the radial

00:20:46.855 --> 00:20:51.485
probability distribution
function reflects the two radial

00:20:51.485 --> 00:20:56.031
nodes in the 3s wave function.
There is a node here at r

00:20:56.031 --> 00:21:00.000
equals 1.9 a nought.

00:21:00.000 --> 00:21:06.510
And there is a node here at r
equals 7.1 a nought.

00:21:06.510 --> 00:21:10.214
The two radial nodes for 3s.

00:21:10.214 --> 00:21:15.377
And there is no radial node
here at r equals 0.

00:21:15.377 --> 00:21:20.989
This is really important.
Now, if you look at this,

00:21:20.989 --> 00:21:26.938
it is very tempting to look at
this radial probability

00:21:26.938 --> 00:21:33.000
distribution function and say
the following.

00:21:33.000 --> 00:21:38.015
Well, if the electron has some
probability of being over here

00:21:38.015 --> 00:21:42.278
and then it has some probability
of being over here,

00:21:42.278 --> 00:21:46.541
and then it has some
probability of being over here,

00:21:46.541 --> 00:21:51.390
then how does the electron get
from here to here to here if

00:21:51.390 --> 00:21:56.071
this point right here at r
equals 1.9 a nought

00:21:56.071 --> 00:22:00.000
and r equal 7.1 a nought--

00:22:00.000 --> 00:22:05.942
How does it get there if these
points, the probability is zero?

00:22:05.942 --> 00:22:10.638
Well, you say maybe the
probability is just small,

00:22:10.638 --> 00:22:14.376
it's not zero.
But I am telling you that

00:22:14.376 --> 00:22:17.923
probability is zero,
zip, zilch, nada,

00:22:17.923 --> 00:22:20.798
nix, cipher,
nought, goose egg.

00:22:20.798 --> 00:22:25.686
Anybody else got another one?
[LAUGHTER] It is zero.

00:22:25.686 --> 00:22:30.000
It is not small.
It is just zero.

00:22:30.000 --> 00:22:32.928
That is an interesting
question.

00:22:32.928 --> 00:22:38.785
And the answer to that question
is that it's not an appropriate

00:22:38.785 --> 00:22:41.618
question.
It's not appropriate,

00:22:41.618 --> 00:22:47.381
because when you ask how does a
particle get from one place to

00:22:47.381 --> 00:22:53.237
another place to another place,
what you're asking about is the

00:22:53.237 --> 00:22:59.000
trajectory of a particle.
You're asking for a path.

00:22:59.000 --> 00:23:04.363
How does it get from here to
here to here to here?

00:23:04.363 --> 00:23:09.946
That's a classical idea.
And this is not a classical

00:23:09.946 --> 00:23:15.639
system, so that's why the
question isn't appropriate.

00:23:15.639 --> 00:23:21.550
Instead, what we have to think
about this is as a wave.

00:23:21.550 --> 00:23:25.600
The electron is represented by
a wave.

00:23:25.600 --> 00:23:32.168
And you know that a wave can
have amplitude at many values of

00:23:32.168 --> 00:23:37.798
x or at many distances.
It can have amplitude,

00:23:37.798 --> 00:23:41.968
and it does right here,
at the same time that it has

00:23:41.968 --> 00:23:45.484
amplitude here,
at the same time that it has

00:23:45.484 --> 00:23:48.836
amplitude there.
That's the answer to that

00:23:48.836 --> 00:23:51.534
question.
You have to look at this

00:23:51.534 --> 00:23:56.276
electron as a way that can have
amplitude at many different

00:23:56.276 --> 00:24:00.610
positions simultaneously.
I know that seems strange to

00:24:00.610 --> 00:24:04.467
you.
But this is a different world.

00:24:04.467 --> 00:24:09.402
This is a world that you don't
have everyday experience with.

00:24:09.402 --> 00:24:14.008
That's why it seems strange.
But it is part of our world.

00:24:14.008 --> 00:24:18.943
It's just the world that you've
got to do some experiments to

00:24:18.943 --> 00:24:21.000
actually see.
Yes?

00:24:29.000 --> 00:24:34.571
What I am talking about here,
and I didn't emphasize,

00:24:34.571 --> 00:24:39.928
I'm talking about something
called a standing wave.

00:24:39.928 --> 00:24:44.107
You are thinking about a
traveling wave.

00:24:44.107 --> 00:24:50.428
One thing I think I forgot to
tell you the last time is that

00:24:50.428 --> 00:24:55.678
the wave function is,
in general, a function of r,

00:24:55.678 --> 00:25:02.210
theta, phi, and time.
But what I forgot to tell you

00:25:02.210 --> 00:25:08.632
is that we were not going to
look at the time dependence of

00:25:08.632 --> 00:25:13.392
these waves.
And the reason is because we're

00:25:13.392 --> 00:25:18.707
going to be looking at a
hydrogen atom that isn't

00:25:18.707 --> 00:25:22.250
undergoing any chemical
reaction.

00:25:22.250 --> 00:25:30.000
So the electron of the hydrogen
atom is bound to the nucleus.

00:25:30.000 --> 00:25:32.302
And it stays there,
in a sense.

00:25:32.302 --> 00:25:35.525
It is stable.
We're not going to be looking

00:25:35.525 --> 00:25:40.054
at the wave function as two
hydrogen atoms come together and

00:25:40.054 --> 00:25:44.121
make a hydrogen molecule.
Then, if we were doing that,

00:25:44.121 --> 00:25:47.115
we'd have to invoke the time
dependence.

00:25:47.115 --> 00:25:51.106
But because we're going to
start here by looking at a

00:25:51.106 --> 00:25:53.101
hydrogen atom,
helium atom,

00:25:53.101 --> 00:25:57.476
etc., an isolated stable atom,
there is no time dependence

00:25:57.476 --> 00:26:00.009
here.
So we're actually looking at

00:26:00.009 --> 00:26:04.000
something called stationary
waves.

00:26:04.000 --> 00:26:07.067
And that has no time dependence
in it.

00:26:07.067 --> 00:26:10.963
So this is called
time-independent or stationary

00:26:10.963 --> 00:26:15.108
wave of quantum mechanics,
time-independent quantum

00:26:15.108 --> 00:26:18.507
mechanics.
There is time-dependent quantum

00:26:18.507 --> 00:26:20.000
mechanics.

00:26:30.000 --> 00:26:35.102
That's a very good question.
And it doesn't choose to stay

00:26:35.102 --> 00:26:39.757
in the 3s state very long.
That is an unstable state.

00:26:39.757 --> 00:26:43.785
In other words,
if we put the electron in that

00:26:43.785 --> 00:26:47.902
3s state, and we have to put
energy to do that,

00:26:47.902 --> 00:26:52.736
that electron does want to be
in the more stable state,

00:26:52.736 --> 00:26:57.480
which is the 1s state.
And there will be a probability

00:26:57.480 --> 00:27:02.941
of that electron dropping down
to the 1s state and emitting in

00:27:02.941 --> 00:27:06.744
a photon.
Just like we saw in the

00:27:06.744 --> 00:27:09.323
hydrogen atom discharge
experiment.

00:27:09.323 --> 00:27:13.342
We put those hydrogen atoms
into these excited states.

00:27:13.342 --> 00:27:15.769
They didn't stay there very
long.

00:27:15.769 --> 00:27:19.030
They dropped down,
and when they did so they

00:27:19.030 --> 00:27:22.216
emitted a photon.
And there is some natural

00:27:22.216 --> 00:27:26.539
probability of that happening.
In the case of the hydrogen

00:27:26.539 --> 00:27:30.483
atom, those lifetimes,
depending on what state you're

00:27:30.483 --> 00:27:33.969
in --
If it's a very high Rydberg,

00:27:33.969 --> 00:27:37.417
they have long lifetimes,
but for 3s or something,

00:27:37.417 --> 00:27:39.949
maybe 10^-10 seconds,
10^-11 seconds,

00:27:39.949 --> 00:27:42.130
it doesn't last there very
long.

00:27:42.130 --> 00:27:44.311
It does emit.
It does come down.

00:27:44.311 --> 00:27:47.688
It doesn't want to be there for
a very long time.

00:27:47.688 --> 00:27:51.698
And what that probability is
has to do with the overlap of

00:27:51.698 --> 00:27:55.778
the wave functions between the
initial and the final state,

00:27:55.778 --> 00:28:00.000
which isn't something that
we're going to do.

00:28:00.000 --> 00:28:07.307
But well understood.
Now it's actually time to look

00:28:07.307 --> 00:28:14.469
at the p-orbitals.
With the s-orbitals we saw they

00:28:14.469 --> 00:28:19.000
were spherically symmetric.

00:28:29.000 --> 00:28:32.882
And we used those s-orbitals to
illustrate a lot of concepts,

00:28:32.882 --> 00:28:36.052
what we meant by a wave
function, what we meant by

00:28:36.052 --> 00:28:38.835
probability density,
what we meant by radial

00:28:38.835 --> 00:28:43.051
probability.
But now, we're going to look at

00:28:43.051 --> 00:28:47.677
the 2p wave functions.
And the p wave functions,

00:28:47.677 --> 00:28:53.484
as you probably already know,
are not spherically symmetric.

00:28:53.484 --> 00:28:58.503
We're going to use this dot
density diagram again to

00:28:58.503 --> 00:29:03.129
represent the probability
density for the p wave

00:29:03.129 --> 00:29:07.408
functions.
And so I am going to take the

00:29:07.408 --> 00:29:12.142
psi(2, 1, 0) wave function,
and I am going to square it to

00:29:12.142 --> 00:29:17.043
get the probability density.
And then I am going to plot the

00:29:17.043 --> 00:29:19.867
result of that in three
dimensions.

00:29:19.867 --> 00:29:23.023
And the result is what I show
you here.

00:29:23.023 --> 00:29:26.760
And, of course,
this is the typical pz-orbital

00:29:26.760 --> 00:29:31.535
that you've all seen before.
And what you see,

00:29:31.535 --> 00:29:36.143
in the case of the pz state or
the pz wave function,

00:29:36.143 --> 00:29:41.744
is that the probability density
is symmetric around this z-axis

00:29:41.744 --> 00:29:44.364
here.
Most of that probability

00:29:44.364 --> 00:29:47.978
density is concentrated along
the z-axis.

00:29:47.978 --> 00:29:52.585
And, if you look very
carefully, you can sort of see

00:29:52.585 --> 00:29:59.000
that there is no probability
density here in this x,y-plane.

00:29:59.000 --> 00:30:03.446
Here is the px-orbital.
I am plotting the probability

00:30:03.446 --> 00:30:06.439
density.
That probability density is

00:30:06.439 --> 00:30:11.057
concentrated along the x-axis.
It's symmetric along the

00:30:11.057 --> 00:30:13.451
x-axis.
And, if you look very

00:30:13.451 --> 00:30:18.410
carefully, you can see that
there is no probability density

00:30:18.410 --> 00:30:21.916
in the y,z-plane.
And then the py-orbital,

00:30:21.916 --> 00:30:26.790
that probability density is
concentrated along the y-axis.

00:30:26.790 --> 00:30:31.750
If you look very carefully,
there is no probability density

00:30:31.750 --> 00:30:36.752
here in the x,z-plane.
And the other thing I just

00:30:36.752 --> 00:30:39.649
wanted to note,
you see I got this plus sign

00:30:39.649 --> 00:30:43.625
here and the minus sign there,
plus sign there and the minus

00:30:43.625 --> 00:30:47.938
sign there, that we talked about
the other day just very briefly.

00:30:47.938 --> 00:30:51.711
That just indicates the sign of
the amplitude of the wave

00:30:51.711 --> 00:30:54.339
function.
Not the wave function squared,

00:30:54.339 --> 00:30:57.978
but the wave function itself.
Remember, sometimes it is

00:30:57.978 --> 00:31:01.239
called the phase.
In this part here,

00:31:01.239 --> 00:31:04.752
below this x,y-plane,
the wave function actually has

00:31:04.752 --> 00:31:07.989
a negative value.
In this part the wave function

00:31:07.989 --> 00:31:11.571
has a positive value.
And I said that the sign of the

00:31:11.571 --> 00:31:15.772
wave function was going to be
important, because when we start

00:31:15.772 --> 00:31:18.459
to make bonds,
whether you have two wave

00:31:18.459 --> 00:31:22.178
functions that are overlapping
and they have a positive

00:31:22.178 --> 00:31:25.071
amplitude, well,
then you have constructive

00:31:25.071 --> 00:31:28.700
interference.
When you have bonding,

00:31:28.700 --> 00:31:32.796
if you've got two wave
functions that overlap and they

00:31:32.796 --> 00:31:35.887
have opposite signs,
you're going to have

00:31:35.887 --> 00:31:39.983
destructive interference,
and you're not going to have

00:31:39.983 --> 00:31:42.843
bonding.
So that will become important

00:31:42.843 --> 00:31:46.939
later on in the course.
But now, as I started to point

00:31:46.939 --> 00:31:50.880
out as I went through here,
what we've got are nodal

00:31:50.880 --> 00:31:53.740
planes.
We've got planes here in which

00:31:53.740 --> 00:31:57.990
there is no probability density
because there is no wave

00:31:57.990 --> 00:32:01.746
function.
And nodal planes are a

00:32:01.746 --> 00:32:06.190
consequence of angular nodes.
Angular nodes are values of

00:32:06.190 --> 00:32:11.190
theta and phi that will make the
wave function be equal to zero.

00:32:11.190 --> 00:32:15.952
So a radial node is a value of
r that makes the wave function

00:32:15.952 --> 00:32:20.238
be zero; angular nodes are
values of theta and phi that

00:32:20.238 --> 00:32:23.333
make the wave function be equal
to zero.

00:32:23.333 --> 00:32:27.857
And the consequence of an
angular node is that you have an

00:32:27.857 --> 00:32:32.492
angular plane.
That you have a nodal plane.

00:32:32.492 --> 00:32:35.875
For example,
in the case of the pz wave

00:32:35.875 --> 00:32:41.572
function, when theta is equal to
90, that makes the wave function

00:32:41.572 --> 00:32:44.154
be zero.
And theta equal to 90

00:32:44.154 --> 00:32:47.982
corresponds to everywhere on
this x,y-plane.

00:32:47.982 --> 00:32:52.077
In the case of the px,
when phi is equal to 90,

00:32:52.077 --> 00:32:55.727
if you plug it into your px
wave function,

00:32:55.727 --> 00:33:00.000
you will find that you'll get
zero.

00:33:00.000 --> 00:33:05.077
And when phi is equal to 90,
that means everywhere on the

00:33:05.077 --> 00:33:08.522
y,z-plane, you have zero wave
function.

00:33:08.522 --> 00:33:12.874
And the same thing here for the
py wave function,

00:33:12.874 --> 00:33:17.317
phi is equal to zero.
That means everywhere on the

00:33:17.317 --> 00:33:22.122
x,z-plane you have the wave
function be equal to zero.

00:33:22.122 --> 00:33:26.021
So these nodal planes,
the angular nodes are

00:33:26.021 --> 00:33:31.189
consequences of values of theta
and phi that make the wave

00:33:31.189 --> 00:33:34.861
function be zero.
All right.

00:33:34.861 --> 00:33:39.513
In general, and this is
something you really do have to

00:33:39.513 --> 00:33:44.510
know, the total number of nodes
that a wave function has is

00:33:44.510 --> 00:33:48.559
always n minus 1.
It is given

00:33:48.559 --> 00:33:51.920
by the principle quantum number
minus 1.

00:33:51.920 --> 00:33:56.830
The number of angular nodes is
always given by the angular

00:33:56.830 --> 00:34:02.000
momentum quantum number l.

00:34:02.000 --> 00:34:06.099
If l is equal to 1,
you have a p wave function,

00:34:06.099 --> 00:34:10.198
you've got one angular node.
And so, therefore,

00:34:10.198 --> 00:34:15.099
if l is the number of angular
nodes and n minus 1 is the

00:34:15.099 --> 00:34:19.643
number of total nodes,
and you only have angular and

00:34:19.643 --> 00:34:23.386
radial nodes,
then n minus 1 minus l is the

00:34:23.386 --> 00:34:29.000
number of radial nodes.

00:34:29.000 --> 00:34:34.619
So the only thing you have to
remember is l always gives you

00:34:34.619 --> 00:34:39.761
the number of angular nodes,
and you have to remember n

00:34:39.761 --> 00:34:45.476
minus 1 is the number of total
nodes, and then you can always

00:34:45.476 --> 00:34:51.285
just figure out that n minus 1
minus l is the number of radial

00:34:51.285 --> 00:34:53.000
nodes.
For example,

00:34:53.000 --> 00:34:56.904
here, 2p orbital,
number of total nodes 1,

00:34:56.904 --> 00:35:03.000
number of angular nodes 1,
number of radial nodes 0.

00:35:03.000 --> 00:35:06.774
You've got to know this.
And the other thing you have to

00:35:06.774 --> 00:35:10.480
know is you have to be able to
go the other way around.

00:35:10.480 --> 00:35:13.500
In other words,
if I tell you a wave function

00:35:13.500 --> 00:35:16.931
has so many angular nodes and so
many radial nodes,

00:35:16.931 --> 00:35:19.950
tell me what the possible wave
functions are.

00:35:19.950 --> 00:35:24.000
So you've got to be able to go
both ways on this.

00:35:34.000 --> 00:35:38.749
We've looked at kind of the
shapes of these p wave functions

00:35:38.749 --> 00:35:43.578
by looking at the probability
densities, but there is another

00:35:43.578 --> 00:35:48.006
aspect of these p wave functions
that I want to look at.

00:35:48.006 --> 00:35:52.916
And that is that I want to look
at their radial probabilities.

00:35:52.916 --> 00:35:57.504
I want to look at the radial
probability distributions for

00:35:57.504 --> 00:36:02.961
the p wave functions.
And compare those to the s wave

00:36:02.961 --> 00:36:06.591
functions.
And so I've plotted here the

00:36:06.591 --> 00:36:11.653
radial probability for the 2s.
We just looked at that.

00:36:11.653 --> 00:36:17.002
And I plotted here the radial
probability for the 2p wave

00:36:17.002 --> 00:36:20.632
function.
Again, the radial probability

00:36:20.632 --> 00:36:26.459
here at r is equal to 0 is zero.
And for the 2p wave function,

00:36:26.459 --> 00:36:32.000
you can see that there is no
other radial node.

00:36:32.000 --> 00:36:35.762
A 2p wave function doesn't have
a radial node.

00:36:35.762 --> 00:36:40.025
You can see that reflected in
the radial probability

00:36:40.025 --> 00:36:43.453
distribution.
But the point I want to make

00:36:43.453 --> 00:36:47.633
right here is this.
That the most probable value of

00:36:47.633 --> 00:36:52.064
r for an electron in the 2p
state is actually a little

00:36:52.064 --> 00:36:58.000
closer in than the most probable
value of r for the 2s state.

00:36:58.000 --> 00:37:01.979
As the angular momentum quantum
number goes up,

00:37:01.979 --> 00:37:06.910
on the average the electrons
are a little bit closer in to

00:37:06.910 --> 00:37:11.928
the nucleus, on the average.
Here is the radial probability

00:37:11.928 --> 00:37:16.340
for 3s that we looked at.
You can see the two radial

00:37:16.340 --> 00:37:20.666
nodes here, one here,
one here, r equals 0 is not a

00:37:20.666 --> 00:37:24.300
radial node.
Here is the radial probability

00:37:24.300 --> 00:37:27.328
for the 3p state.
You can see in 3p,

00:37:27.328 --> 00:37:32.000
we've got one radial node right
in here.

00:37:32.000 --> 00:37:35.469
This is not a radial node.
And here is the 3d state.

00:37:35.469 --> 00:37:38.734
We didn't look at the
probability density for 3d.

00:37:38.734 --> 00:37:42.612
You will look at that with
Professor Drennan in the second

00:37:42.612 --> 00:37:46.353
half of the course when we talk
about transition metals.

00:37:46.353 --> 00:37:49.006
But here you don't see any
radial nodes.

00:37:49.006 --> 00:37:52.272
You see an r equals 0,
but that is because of our

00:37:52.272 --> 00:37:55.673
definition for the radial
probability distribution.

00:37:55.673 --> 00:37:59.687
Again, the point I want to make
is here is the most probable

00:37:59.687 --> 00:38:03.568
value of r for 3s.
Here it is for 3p.

00:38:03.568 --> 00:38:07.750
Here it is for 3d.
Again, the most probable value

00:38:07.750 --> 00:38:12.018
of r for 3d is a little smaller
than it is for 3p,

00:38:12.018 --> 00:38:16.723
is a smaller than it is for 3s.
In general, the angular

00:38:16.723 --> 00:38:22.125
momentum quantum number goes up.
The electrons are a little bit

00:38:22.125 --> 00:38:28.072
closer into the nucleus.
However, and this is important,

00:38:28.072 --> 00:38:33.524
only in the s-orbitals or the s
states is there really a

00:38:33.524 --> 00:38:39.274
substantial probability of being
very close to the nucleus.

00:38:39.274 --> 00:38:43.536
Because, look,
it's only in the 3s or the 2s

00:38:43.536 --> 00:38:48.294
do you have really some
probability that is very,

00:38:48.294 --> 00:38:53.944
very close to the nucleus.
You don't have that in 3p or 3d

00:38:53.944 --> 00:38:57.215
or 2p.
So there is kind of a irony

00:38:57.215 --> 00:39:01.493
here.
It's only in the s states that

00:39:01.493 --> 00:39:05.649
you have a considerable
probability of being really

00:39:05.649 --> 00:39:08.642
close to the nucleus.
But in general,

00:39:08.642 --> 00:39:12.881
as you increase the angular
momentum quantum number,

00:39:12.881 --> 00:39:17.785
the most probable value of r
comes in closer to the nucleus.

00:39:17.785 --> 00:39:21.110
So we've got two competing
factors there.

00:39:21.110 --> 00:39:25.848
Now, this information on this
slide here might seem to you

00:39:25.848 --> 00:39:32.000
kind of like it's unattached,
and why is she telling me this.

00:39:32.000 --> 00:39:36.704
And I understand that that's
probably how you feel at the

00:39:36.704 --> 00:39:42.081
moment, but I have to tell it to
you now, because next time we're

00:39:42.081 --> 00:39:46.953
going to use this information to
understand the behavior of

00:39:46.953 --> 00:39:50.062
atoms.
This information is going to be

00:39:50.062 --> 00:39:53.506
important.
We're going to refer back to it

00:39:53.506 --> 00:39:57.959
in the next few lectures.
We're done at the moment for

00:39:57.959 --> 00:40:03.000
what we're going to say about
the hydrogen atom.

00:40:03.000 --> 00:40:09.466
And now it's time to move on to
multi-electron atoms.

00:40:09.466 --> 00:40:14.564
And we're going to start here
with helium.

00:40:14.564 --> 00:40:22.025
Well, the SchrÃ¶dinger equation,
of course, correctly predicts

00:40:22.025 --> 00:40:27.000
the atomic structure of all
atoms.

00:40:27.000 --> 00:40:31.623
But the difficulty is that as
you increase the number of

00:40:31.623 --> 00:40:36.078
electrons, the problem,
the differential equation that

00:40:36.078 --> 00:40:40.197
you have to solve,
gets more and more complicated.

00:40:40.197 --> 00:40:45.072
And there is no nice analytical
way to solve that equation,

00:40:45.072 --> 00:40:49.947
which means that there is not
going to be a nice analytical

00:40:49.947 --> 00:40:53.982
form, for example,
for the allowed energies for a

00:40:53.982 --> 00:40:58.043
helium atom.
That is, we're not going to get

00:40:58.043 --> 00:41:02.065
an expression of E sub n equal
to minus R sub H over n squared.

00:41:02.065 --> 00:41:05.098
This is a nice analytical

00:41:05.098 --> 00:41:07.802
expression for the hydrogen atom
energies.

00:41:07.802 --> 00:41:10.307
We're not going to get that for
helium.

00:41:10.307 --> 00:41:14.065
So if you solve the equation
for helium, what you actually

00:41:14.065 --> 00:41:17.494
have to do numerically,
what you're going to get is a

00:41:17.494 --> 00:41:21.450
list of numbers and you're not
going to get a nice analytical

00:41:21.450 --> 00:41:25.274
form for the wave function.
What you're going to get is the

00:41:25.274 --> 00:41:28.175
amplitude of the function as a
function of r,

00:41:28.175 --> 00:41:32.000
theta and phi,
another list of numbers.

00:41:32.000 --> 00:41:36.878
But the truth is,
as you increase the number of

00:41:36.878 --> 00:41:41.227
electrons in the system,
you very quickly,

00:41:41.227 --> 00:41:46.848
by the time you get to three
and four, run into such a

00:41:46.848 --> 00:41:53.000
problem that you cannot even
solve the SchrÃ¶dinger equation

00:41:53.000 --> 00:41:56.181
exactly, even numerically.
Why?

00:41:56.181 --> 00:42:01.172
Well, here is the example.
Here is helium.

00:42:01.172 --> 00:42:04.533
Here is the SchrÃ¶dinger
equation for helium.

00:42:04.533 --> 00:42:07.973
I didn't write out the
Hamiltonian precisely.

00:42:07.973 --> 00:42:10.787
I just wrote the general
Hamiltonian.

00:42:10.787 --> 00:42:15.477
But what I want you to see is
that the true wave function for

00:42:15.477 --> 00:42:19.541
the helium atom would be a wave
function that had six

00:42:19.541 --> 00:42:23.371
coordinates in it.
Two values of r for each one of

00:42:23.371 --> 00:42:26.264
the electrons,
electron 1, electron 2.

00:42:26.264 --> 00:42:30.402
Two values of theta.
Two values of phi.

00:42:30.402 --> 00:42:34.997
We already have six coordinates
in that wave function in the

00:42:34.997 --> 00:42:38.035
case of helium.
And as we go to lithium,

00:42:38.035 --> 00:42:41.228
beryllium, boron,
the number of electrons,

00:42:41.228 --> 00:42:44.889
these wave functions,
the number of coordinates,

00:42:44.889 --> 00:42:49.484
it just goes up exponentially.
And so in order to solve this

00:42:49.484 --> 00:42:53.301
equation, we're going to need
some approximations.

00:42:53.301 --> 00:42:57.741
And we're going to talk about
the most basic approximation

00:42:57.741 --> 00:43:01.869
that there is.
And that is called the

00:43:01.869 --> 00:43:06.798
one-electron wave approximation
or the one-electron orbital

00:43:06.798 --> 00:43:10.623
approximation.
And here is the essence of that

00:43:10.623 --> 00:43:14.447
approximation.
What we're going to do is we're

00:43:14.447 --> 00:43:19.716
going to take that wave function
and we're going to assume that

00:43:19.716 --> 00:43:24.305
that wave function can be
factored into a wave function

00:43:24.305 --> 00:43:30.000
for electron one times a wave
function for electron two.

00:43:30.000 --> 00:43:35.501
So it's a one electron wave.
Each electron gets its own wave

00:43:35.501 --> 00:43:40.257
in this approximation.
We're going to make a further

00:43:40.257 --> 00:43:44.453
approximation.
And that is that we're going to

00:43:44.453 --> 00:43:49.954
give the functional form to
electron one in the helium atom.

00:43:49.954 --> 00:43:55.083
We're going to give it a
functional form that looks like

00:43:55.083 --> 00:44:01.356
that of an electron in hydrogen.
We're going to give it the

00:44:01.356 --> 00:44:06.341
psi(1,0,0) wave function.
Same thing for electron number

00:44:06.341 --> 00:44:11.416
two, or an alternate way to
write that is 1s 1 times 1s 2

00:44:11.416 --> 00:44:15.676
where this refers
to electron one,

00:44:15.676 --> 00:44:20.933
this refers to electron two.
And a more shorthand way is to

00:44:20.933 --> 00:44:23.652
write this as 1s 2,
1s squared.

00:44:23.652 --> 00:44:29.000
So that's the
approximation for helium.

00:44:29.000 --> 00:44:31.563
Let's just carry it out for
lithium.

00:44:31.563 --> 00:44:35.883
Well, here is what the wave
function would really look like,

00:44:35.883 --> 00:44:40.204
the function of nine variables.
But we're going to give each

00:44:40.204 --> 00:44:44.012
electron its own wave function
in this approximation.

00:44:44.012 --> 00:44:48.553
And, again, we're going to say
electron one has the 1s hydrogen

00:44:48.553 --> 00:44:52.507
wave function and electron two
has the 1s hydrogen wave

00:44:52.507 --> 00:44:58.000
function, and electron three has
the 2s hydrogen wave function.

00:44:58.000 --> 00:45:02.828
Another way to write that is 1s
2 2s.

00:45:02.828 --> 00:45:06.047
Do you have a question over
here?

00:45:06.047 --> 00:45:08.059
Can I help you?
Okay.

00:45:08.059 --> 00:45:10.372
How about beryllium?
16.

00:45:10.372 --> 00:45:15.000
But we're going to use our
approximation again.

00:45:15.000 --> 00:45:20.733
One electron is 1s 1s 2s 2s.
The way to write that is 1s 2

00:45:20.733 --> 00:45:24.857
2s 2.
And we can keep going.

00:45:24.857 --> 00:45:29.686
And when I keep going,
you go, oh, I've seen this

00:45:29.686 --> 00:45:33.916
before.
You've written down the

00:45:33.916 --> 00:45:38.833
electron configurations for all
of the atoms in the periodic

00:45:38.833 --> 00:45:40.500
table.
Here they are.

00:45:40.500 --> 00:45:45.416
Do you know what those electron
configurations were that you

00:45:45.416 --> 00:45:48.666
wrote down?
They were just the shorthand

00:45:48.666 --> 00:45:53.583
notation for the one-electron
wave function approximation to

00:45:53.583 --> 00:45:56.250
solve the SchrÃ¶dinger's
equation.

00:45:56.250 --> 00:46:00.000
That what those were.
That's it.

00:46:00.000 --> 00:46:05.060
Nothing more.
But now what you do notice is

00:46:05.060 --> 00:46:11.325
that when I got to boron here,
I didn't give all five

00:46:11.325 --> 00:46:16.024
electrons the 1s hydrogen wave
function.

00:46:16.024 --> 00:46:22.771
And when I got to carbon,
I didn't give all six electrons

00:46:22.771 --> 00:46:30.000
the 1s hydrogen wave function.
Why didn't I do that?

00:46:30.000 --> 00:46:34.968
Well, you already know that
there is something called

00:46:34.968 --> 00:46:39.649
"spin." And you already know
that in the 1s state,

00:46:39.649 --> 00:46:44.426
you can only put in two
electrons, and one of those

00:46:44.426 --> 00:46:49.681
electrons has to be spin up and
one has to be spin down.

00:46:49.681 --> 00:46:54.267
And the same thing for all of
these other states,

00:46:54.267 --> 00:47:00.000
one has to be spin up and one
has to be spin down.

00:47:00.000 --> 00:47:04.671
Here is the electron
configuration here for neon.

00:47:04.671 --> 00:47:09.634
That electron configuration
just being the shorthand

00:47:09.634 --> 00:47:15.181
notation for the wave function
in the one-electron orbital

00:47:15.181 --> 00:47:19.171
approximation.
Now we've got to talk about

00:47:19.171 --> 00:47:22.674
spin.
What is this thing called spin?

00:47:22.674 --> 00:47:29.000
Well, spin is entirely a
quantum mechanical phenomenon.

00:47:29.000 --> 00:47:34.272
It has no classical analogy
that is accurate,

00:47:34.272 --> 00:47:39.185
that is correct.
Spin is intrinsic angular

00:47:39.185 --> 00:47:43.859
momentum.
It is angular momentum that is

00:47:43.859 --> 00:47:50.450
built into your particle.
It's part of the nature of the

00:47:50.450 --> 00:47:53.925
particle.
Electrons have spin.

00:47:53.925 --> 00:47:59.921
How do you see the spin?
Well, if you solve the

00:47:59.921 --> 00:48:04.811
relativistic SchrÃ¶dinger's
equation, which we didn't even

00:48:04.811 --> 00:48:09.177
write down, if you solve that
equation, as drafted,

00:48:09.177 --> 00:48:13.107
well, then one other quantum
number drops out,

00:48:13.107 --> 00:48:16.163
and that is the spin quantum
number.

00:48:16.163 --> 00:48:20.791
And that spin quantum number we
call m sub s.

00:48:20.791 --> 00:48:23.760
And m sub s has two allowed
values.

00:48:23.760 --> 00:48:29.000
It can be one half or it can be
minus one half.

00:48:29.000 --> 00:48:34.401
So here we have a quantum
number that is not an integer.

00:48:34.401 --> 00:48:37.446
It's one half or minus one
half.

00:48:37.446 --> 00:48:43.339
Now, what students often like
to do is to think about spin as

00:48:43.339 --> 00:48:48.642
a classical analogy whereby if
you have some electrons,

00:48:48.642 --> 00:48:54.241
so this is my electron here,
and it is spinning around its

00:48:54.241 --> 00:49:00.232
own axis, the angular momentum
vectum is perpendicular to that

00:49:00.232 --> 00:49:04.453
plane.
And if it is spinning in this

00:49:04.453 --> 00:49:07.667
direction, you might call this
spin up.

00:49:07.667 --> 00:49:11.389
But, of course,
if it's spinning in the other

00:49:11.389 --> 00:49:16.042
direction, and then the angular
momentum vector is again

00:49:16.042 --> 00:49:20.948
perpendicular to that plane,
you might call that spin down.

00:49:20.948 --> 00:49:24.924
This is a classical analogy
that is not correct.

00:49:24.924 --> 00:49:30.000
The electron is not rotating
around its own axis.

00:49:30.000 --> 00:49:34.728
But if it's going to help you
think about that right now,

00:49:34.728 --> 00:49:39.795
okay, just remember it's not
really correct because this idea

00:49:39.795 --> 00:49:42.919
of spin is intrinsic angular
momentum.

00:49:42.919 --> 00:49:46.804
It's part of the nature of the
particle itself.

00:49:46.804 --> 00:49:51.617
Next time I will tell you about
Uhlenbeck and Goudsmit and

00:49:51.617 --> 00:49:53.217
Pauli.
See you Wednesday.
