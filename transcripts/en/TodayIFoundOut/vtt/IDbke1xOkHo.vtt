00:00:00.580 --> 00:00:02.649
Why we Throw Coins into Fountains

00:00:02.649 --> 00:00:06.500
People have been throwing coins into fountains
seemingly as long as there have been coins

00:00:06.500 --> 00:00:07.500
and fountains.

00:00:07.500 --> 00:00:09.509
The tradition all started with water.

00:00:09.509 --> 00:00:13.580
While many people in the developed world today
have clean, drinkable water readily available

00:00:13.580 --> 00:00:16.650
from their kitchen taps, this was not always
the case.

00:00:16.650 --> 00:00:20.320
Potable drinking holes in many regions weren’t
the easiest things to find.

00:00:20.320 --> 00:00:25.380
Thus, where clean water was available, many
early European tribes believed that such areas

00:00:25.380 --> 00:00:27.260
were a gift from the gods.

00:00:27.260 --> 00:00:31.509
The idea that drinkable water was sent from
the heavens remained even as wells and fountains

00:00:31.509 --> 00:00:32.509
were built.

00:00:32.509 --> 00:00:36.820
Often, a small statue of a god could be found
next to early wells and fountains, turning

00:00:36.820 --> 00:00:38.880
them into a type of shrine.

00:00:38.880 --> 00:00:43.040
As you probably already know, presenting gifts
to gods is an ancient practice that was usually

00:00:43.040 --> 00:00:47.820
meant to appease angry gods, or to act as
a payment for a request or prayer.

00:00:47.820 --> 00:00:52.140
In the case of fountains and wells, people
would toss in a coin while sending up a prayer—an

00:00:52.140 --> 00:00:54.310
early version of making a wish.

00:00:54.310 --> 00:00:59.230
One rather prolific well can be found in Northumberland,
England, and was used to pray to the Celtic

00:00:59.230 --> 00:01:02.270
goddess of wells and springs, Coventina.

00:01:02.270 --> 00:01:06.170
16,000 coins from different eras of the Roman
Empire were found there.

00:01:06.170 --> 00:01:10.330
Interestingly, most of the coins found in
the Coventina Fountain were low denominations,

00:01:10.330 --> 00:01:15.140
much like today where people are usually more
willing to part with a 5 or 10 cent coin rather

00:01:15.140 --> 00:01:17.480
than a full dollar, euro, or pound.

00:01:17.480 --> 00:01:19.600
Of course, it wasn’t always coins.

00:01:19.600 --> 00:01:23.760
The Well of Pen Rhys in Oxford, England called
for pieces of clothing to be tossed in.

00:01:23.760 --> 00:01:27.440
In this case, it was thought that the water
had healing powers and that the clothing carried

00:01:27.440 --> 00:01:32.810
disease, so by tossing a button, pin, or piece
of fabric into the well, you would be healed.

00:01:32.810 --> 00:01:36.580
The belief in the healing powers of the Well
of Pen Rhys remained popular well into the

00:01:36.580 --> 00:01:37.810
18th century.

00:01:37.810 --> 00:01:41.540
These days, believing in gods watching over
the wells or the thought that water has healing

00:01:41.540 --> 00:01:46.690
powers has largely lost favour, but people
still practice this ancient tradition, in

00:01:46.690 --> 00:01:49.190
modern times usually making a wish.

00:01:49.190 --> 00:01:52.880
Probably one of the most famous examples of
a wishing fountain is the Trevi Fountain in

00:01:52.880 --> 00:01:53.880
Rome.

00:01:53.880 --> 00:01:57.270
The Trevi Fountain was built as the ending
point of a 21 kilometre long aqueduct called

00:01:57.270 --> 00:02:01.770
Virgo, named for the goddess who would guide
soldiers to water when they were thirsty and

00:02:01.770 --> 00:02:02.770
tired.

00:02:02.770 --> 00:02:06.520
Originally, tossing a coin in or taking a
drink from the fountain was supposed to ensure

00:02:06.520 --> 00:02:07.520
good health.

00:02:07.520 --> 00:02:11.370
Eventually, the tradition evolved to what
we know today: if you toss a coin over your

00:02:11.370 --> 00:02:14.580
shoulder into the fountain, you will one day
return to Rome.

00:02:14.580 --> 00:02:20.350
This idea was popularized in the 1954 film
Three Coins in the Fountain, which also suggested

00:02:20.350 --> 00:02:24.450
that if you throw two coins in, you’ll fall
in love with a Roman, and if you throw three

00:02:24.450 --> 00:02:26.900
coins in, you’ll marry him or her.

00:02:26.900 --> 00:02:31.200
Since the movie, this practice has become
so popular with tourists that it’s estimated

00:02:31.200 --> 00:02:36.650
that around €3,000 in coins are thrown in
the fountain every day.

00:02:36.650 --> 00:02:40.380
Obviously, all of those coins can’t just
sit in the fountain forever.

00:02:40.380 --> 00:02:44.460
The Trevi Fountain shuts down for one hour
every day and the coins are swept out by the

00:02:44.460 --> 00:02:49.740
Roman Catholic charity Caritas, which pays
for food for the poor as well as Aids shelters.

00:02:49.740 --> 00:03:03.770
The coins have to be cleaned, sorted into
different denominations, and sent off 

00:03:03.770 --> 00:03:07.040
to the bank.
