00:00:01.095 --> 00:00:03.306
You know all those TED-Ed videos you love?

00:00:03.306 --> 00:00:06.277
The beautiful animations that help
you learn new things?

00:00:06.277 --> 00:00:09.917
That experience is free for you,
but it's really expensive for us,

00:00:09.917 --> 00:00:11.177
and that's okay.

00:00:11.177 --> 00:00:13.617
Our mission is to invest 
in thoughtful people,

00:00:13.617 --> 00:00:16.007
but we need some of you to invest in us.

00:00:16.007 --> 00:00:16.758
Why?

00:00:16.758 --> 00:00:18.687
Because the love you've shown TED-Ed

00:00:18.687 --> 00:00:22.127
has already empowered millions of young
people around the world.

00:00:22.127 --> 00:00:25.577
And if you coupled that love with a small
monthly donation on Patreon,

00:00:25.577 --> 00:00:28.637
the TED-Ed experience 
could empower billions.

00:00:28.637 --> 00:00:32.318
"If I could describe the TED-Ed experience
in one word, exhilarating."

00:00:32.318 --> 00:00:33.548
"Innovating."

00:00:33.548 --> 00:00:34.707
"Curiosity."

00:00:34.707 --> 00:00:35.497
"Worthwhile."

00:00:35.497 --> 00:00:36.209
"Inspiring."

00:00:36.209 --> 00:00:36.929
"Eye-opening.

00:00:36.929 --> 00:00:40.748
Oh, that's two words, technically, but
one word if you put a hyphen: eye-opening."

00:00:40.748 --> 00:00:43.199
TED-Ed animations, 
which are written by educators,

00:00:43.199 --> 00:00:46.808
are already being viewed 
by over 2 million learners a day.

00:00:46.808 --> 00:00:50.809
"When I came across TED-Ed,
it was like, 'This is it, this works'"

00:00:50.809 --> 00:00:51.780
With your support,

00:00:51.780 --> 00:00:54.499
we could engage more animators
to work with more teachers,

00:00:54.499 --> 00:00:57.798
and we'd be able to dub our content
into multiple languages.

00:00:57.798 --> 00:01:00.708
"My mind just went poof
right when I saw it."

00:01:00.708 --> 00:01:05.267
We'd also use your investment to grow
our student voice program, TED-Ed Clubs,

00:01:05.267 --> 00:01:10.619
which teaches students how to present
their ideas in the form of TED-style talks.

00:01:10.619 --> 00:01:13.780
Thousands of clubs have formed
in over 120 countries.

00:01:13.780 --> 00:01:18.140
Help us invite a generation 
of young people to TED's main stage.

00:01:18.140 --> 00:01:22.050
"When you turn stuff over to students and
you give them that agency and authority,

00:01:22.050 --> 00:01:24.029
it's so much better because it's them."

00:01:24.029 --> 00:01:25.788
"Thank you."

00:01:25.788 --> 00:01:28.638
"I was like there's something 
for me to start."

00:01:28.638 --> 00:01:30.387
"If you want to support young people,

00:01:30.387 --> 00:01:32.631
you want to support educators 
in your country,

00:01:32.631 --> 00:01:34.130
this is the sort of program,

00:01:34.130 --> 00:01:37.011
or this is the model that 
we really should all be looking at

00:01:37.011 --> 00:01:40.382
when it comes to making 
that change in the world."
