00:00:00.580 --> 00:00:03.660
The next step is to write the loop that's going to do

00:00:03.660 --> 00:00:07.090
the crawling. And we said the process we want to follow is

00:00:07.090 --> 00:00:09.160
to keep going as long as there are more pages to

00:00:09.160 --> 00:00:13.040
crawl. We can do that with a while loop, and we

00:00:13.040 --> 00:00:17.100
can use tocrawl like this in our test condition. If a

00:00:17.100 --> 00:00:20.452
list is empty that's interpreted as false. If the list is

00:00:20.452 --> 00:00:23.650
not empty, that would be interpreted as true. So this means

00:00:23.650 --> 00:00:25.730
the same thing as testing if the length of the list

00:00:25.730 --> 00:00:28.460
is zero, it's a cleaner way to write this by

00:00:28.460 --> 00:00:33.100
just doing while tocrawl. Inside the loop, well, we want to

00:00:33.100 --> 00:00:35.720
pick a page to crawl. We'll store that in the

00:00:35.720 --> 00:00:38.800
variable page. And I'll leave it as a quiz for you

00:00:38.800 --> 00:00:40.740
to figure out a way to pick the page to

00:00:40.740 --> 00:00:44.162
crawl. There's certainly lots of different ways to do this. If

00:00:44.162 --> 00:00:47.712
you're clever and can think about using all the things that

00:00:47.712 --> 00:00:50.978
we learned about, you'll be able to have one line that

00:00:50.978 --> 00:00:53.747
both initializes page to the next page we want to

00:00:53.747 --> 00:00:57.120
crawl, and removes that page from the tocrawl list.
