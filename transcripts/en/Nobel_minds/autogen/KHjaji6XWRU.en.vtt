hi my name is Keisha I'm studying

00:00:01.910 --> 00:00:01.920
hi my name is Keisha I'm studying
 

00:00:01.920 --> 00:00:03.590
hi my name is Keisha I'm studying
physics at something grandma and I was

00:00:03.590 --> 00:00:03.600
physics at something grandma and I was
 

00:00:03.600 --> 00:00:05.749
physics at something grandma and I was
just wondering whether what a black hole

00:00:05.749 --> 00:00:05.759
just wondering whether what a black hole
 

00:00:05.759 --> 00:00:10.070
just wondering whether what a black hole
is and how do we know they exist hi Kish

00:00:10.070 --> 00:00:10.080
is and how do we know they exist hi Kish
 

00:00:10.080 --> 00:00:12.290
is and how do we know they exist hi Kish
hey a black hole is an object that has

00:00:12.290 --> 00:00:12.300
hey a black hole is an object that has
 

00:00:12.300 --> 00:00:14.390
hey a black hole is an object that has
so much mass and so much gravitational

00:00:14.390 --> 00:00:14.400
so much mass and so much gravitational
 

00:00:14.400 --> 00:00:16.790
so much mass and so much gravitational
force that things cannot escape from it

00:00:16.790 --> 00:00:16.800
force that things cannot escape from it
 

00:00:16.800 --> 00:00:19.519
force that things cannot escape from it
not even light can be radiated from it

00:00:19.519 --> 00:00:19.529
not even light can be radiated from it
 

00:00:19.529 --> 00:00:22.330
not even light can be radiated from it
so this is a very very concentrated mass

00:00:22.330 --> 00:00:22.340
so this is a very very concentrated mass
 

00:00:22.340 --> 00:00:24.920
so this is a very very concentrated mass
and you ask how would we know that we'd

00:00:24.920 --> 00:00:24.930
and you ask how would we know that we'd
 

00:00:24.930 --> 00:00:27.500
and you ask how would we know that we'd
found one because if you looked at it

00:00:27.500 --> 00:00:27.510
found one because if you looked at it
 

00:00:27.510 --> 00:00:30.290
found one because if you looked at it
you wouldn't see any light coming out so

00:00:30.290 --> 00:00:30.300
you wouldn't see any light coming out so
 

00:00:30.300 --> 00:00:32.540
you wouldn't see any light coming out so
what we actually see is the light that

00:00:32.540 --> 00:00:32.550
what we actually see is the light that
 

00:00:32.550 --> 00:00:34.190
what we actually see is the light that
comes from materials that are falling

00:00:34.190 --> 00:00:34.200
comes from materials that are falling
 

00:00:34.200 --> 00:00:36.620
comes from materials that are falling
into black holes and the way they become

00:00:36.620 --> 00:00:36.630
into black holes and the way they become
 

00:00:36.630 --> 00:00:38.420
into black holes and the way they become
very hot as they get compressed on the

00:00:38.420 --> 00:00:38.430
very hot as they get compressed on the
 

00:00:38.430 --> 00:00:41.180
very hot as they get compressed on the
way in and so we see x-rays and radio

00:00:41.180 --> 00:00:41.190
way in and so we see x-rays and radio
 

00:00:41.190 --> 00:00:45.500
way in and so we see x-rays and radio
waves and sometimes we even see Jets of

00:00:45.500 --> 00:00:45.510
waves and sometimes we even see Jets of
 

00:00:45.510 --> 00:00:47.779
waves and sometimes we even see Jets of
material that are being ejected instead

00:00:47.779 --> 00:00:47.789
material that are being ejected instead
 

00:00:47.789 --> 00:00:49.700
material that are being ejected instead
of falling all the way in so we see

00:00:49.700 --> 00:00:49.710
of falling all the way in so we see
 

00:00:49.710 --> 00:00:51.380
of falling all the way in so we see
these very active objects and we say oh

00:00:51.380 --> 00:00:51.390
these very active objects and we say oh
 

00:00:51.390 --> 00:00:55.520
these very active objects and we say oh
they must be black holes but how do we

00:00:55.520 --> 00:00:55.530
they must be black holes but how do we
 

00:00:55.530 --> 00:00:57.500
they must be black holes but how do we
know that they're really black holes we

00:00:57.500 --> 00:00:57.510
know that they're really black holes we
 

00:00:57.510 --> 00:01:00.610
know that they're really black holes we
have to also determine their size if a

00:01:00.610 --> 00:01:00.620
have to also determine their size if a
 

00:01:00.620 --> 00:01:02.840
have to also determine their size if a
object of a given mass is small enough

00:01:02.840 --> 00:01:02.850
object of a given mass is small enough
 

00:01:02.850 --> 00:01:05.000
object of a given mass is small enough
then it can't possibly hold itself up

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:05.010
then it can't possibly hold itself up
 

00:01:05.010 --> 00:01:07.160
then it can't possibly hold itself up
under its own gravitational force and it

00:01:07.160 --> 00:01:07.170
under its own gravitational force and it
 

00:01:07.170 --> 00:01:09.320
under its own gravitational force and it
must become a black hole so we've

00:01:09.320 --> 00:01:09.330
must become a black hole so we've
 

00:01:09.330 --> 00:01:11.480
must become a black hole so we've
measured some of these we know how big

00:01:11.480 --> 00:01:11.490
measured some of these we know how big
 

00:01:11.490 --> 00:01:13.910
measured some of these we know how big
they are and we're very sure that there

00:01:13.910 --> 00:01:13.920
they are and we're very sure that there
 

00:01:13.920 --> 00:01:16.700
they are and we're very sure that there
are black holes we've also measured in a

00:01:16.700 --> 00:01:16.710
are black holes we've also measured in a
 

00:01:16.710 --> 00:01:19.310
are black holes we've also measured in a
few cases that we can see things

00:01:19.310 --> 00:01:19.320
few cases that we can see things
 

00:01:19.320 --> 00:01:21.469
few cases that we can see things
orbiting around a black hole in the

00:01:21.469 --> 00:01:21.479
orbiting around a black hole in the
 

00:01:21.479 --> 00:01:23.149
orbiting around a black hole in the
middle of every galaxy seems to be a

00:01:23.149 --> 00:01:23.159
middle of every galaxy seems to be a
 

00:01:23.159 --> 00:01:26.090
middle of every galaxy seems to be a
black hole of a mass of millions to

00:01:26.090 --> 00:01:26.100
black hole of a mass of millions to
 

00:01:26.100 --> 00:01:28.160
black hole of a mass of millions to
billions of times the mass of a single

00:01:28.160 --> 00:01:28.170
billions of times the mass of a single
 

00:01:28.170 --> 00:01:31.850
billions of times the mass of a single
star so how would we know that we see

00:01:31.850 --> 00:01:31.860
star so how would we know that we see
 

00:01:31.860 --> 00:01:34.539
star so how would we know that we see
that things orbit around them and that

00:01:34.539 --> 00:01:34.549
that things orbit around them and that
 

00:01:34.549 --> 00:01:37.039
that things orbit around them and that
we can measure the mass of the central

00:01:37.039 --> 00:01:37.049
we can measure the mass of the central
 

00:01:37.049 --> 00:01:39.620
we can measure the mass of the central
object by the way that the orbits go so

00:01:39.620 --> 00:01:39.630
object by the way that the orbits go so
 

00:01:39.630 --> 00:01:41.240
object by the way that the orbits go so
we see this in the center of our own

00:01:41.240 --> 00:01:41.250
we see this in the center of our own
 

00:01:41.250 --> 00:01:43.609
we see this in the center of our own
galaxy black holes are much more common

00:01:43.609 --> 00:01:43.619
galaxy black holes are much more common
 

00:01:43.619 --> 00:01:45.770
galaxy black holes are much more common
than people imagine they would be many

00:01:45.770 --> 00:01:45.780
than people imagine they would be many
 

00:01:45.780 --> 00:01:47.300
than people imagine they would be many
generations ago when they were first

generations ago when they were first
 

00:01:47.310 --> 00:01:50.030

00:01:50.040 --> 00:01:52.880
imagined in fact hundreds of years ago
people ask the question about could

00:01:52.880 --> 00:01:52.890
people ask the question about could
 

00:01:52.890 --> 00:01:55.100
people ask the question about could
black holes exist but they didn't call

00:01:55.100 --> 00:01:55.110
black holes exist but they didn't call
 

00:01:55.110 --> 00:01:57.319
black holes exist but they didn't call
