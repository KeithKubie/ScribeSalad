00:00:12.904 --> 00:00:18.553
So it's 1969, New York City,

00:00:18.577 --> 00:00:22.117
third grade music class,

00:00:22.141 --> 00:00:28.517
and our teacher brings us into a room
with nothing but a piano and chairs.

00:00:28.541 --> 00:00:31.255
And one by one, he calls us up,

00:00:31.279 --> 00:00:34.088
and he plays middle C,
and he asks us to sing it.

00:00:34.787 --> 00:00:36.604
(Singing)

00:00:37.333 --> 00:00:40.167
And you're either instructed
to go to the right of the room

00:00:40.191 --> 00:00:41.675
or the left side of the room.

00:00:41.699 --> 00:00:43.912
(Laughter)

00:00:45.139 --> 00:00:48.892
And when all 35 kids are done,

00:00:48.916 --> 00:00:51.989
the left side of the room,
which I was a part of,

00:00:52.013 --> 00:00:55.774
was told to stand up
and go back to home room.

00:00:56.237 --> 00:00:58.774
(Laughter)

00:00:58.798 --> 00:01:04.156
And none of us ever received
another music class again

00:01:04.180 --> 00:01:05.410
in elementary school.

00:01:06.313 --> 00:01:10.171
An in club and an out club
was established,

00:01:10.195 --> 00:01:13.972
and I didn't even know
what the gating test was in the moment.

00:01:17.061 --> 00:01:20.545
A few years later, English class ...

00:01:20.569 --> 00:01:22.332
(Laughter)

00:01:22.356 --> 00:01:27.117
first paper of a new semester,

00:01:27.141 --> 00:01:29.164
and I get the paper back,

00:01:29.188 --> 00:01:31.722
and it's C+,

00:01:31.746 --> 00:01:35.037
with the comment,
"Good as can be expected."

00:01:35.061 --> 00:01:37.061
(Laughter)

00:01:38.584 --> 00:01:41.582
Now, honestly, I didn't mind a C+.

00:01:41.606 --> 00:01:44.764
I was just happy it wasn't a C- or a D.

00:01:45.720 --> 00:01:48.955
But the "good as can be
expected" comment ...

00:01:48.979 --> 00:01:51.661
even at that young age,
it didn't seem right.

00:01:52.667 --> 00:01:55.408
It seemed somehow limiting.

00:01:57.600 --> 00:02:02.520
Now, how many people here
have had an experience similar to that,

00:02:02.544 --> 00:02:04.853
either at school or the workplace?

00:02:07.520 --> 00:02:08.782
We're not alone.

00:02:11.003 --> 00:02:14.823
So I guess it might be ironic

00:02:14.847 --> 00:02:18.774
that my life path
would lead me to a career

00:02:18.798 --> 00:02:22.983
of making music and writing
for Blue Man Group

00:02:23.007 --> 00:02:24.522
(Laughter)

00:02:24.546 --> 00:02:26.123
and starting a school.

00:02:26.147 --> 00:02:28.868
(Laughter)

00:02:28.892 --> 00:02:31.043
But school was torture for me.

00:02:32.047 --> 00:02:36.028
As someone who didn't have
a natural proclivity for academics,

00:02:36.052 --> 00:02:39.714
and my teachers never seemed
to understand me,

00:02:39.738 --> 00:02:41.521
I didn't know how to navigate schools

00:02:41.545 --> 00:02:43.972
and schools didn't know
what to do with me.

00:02:45.212 --> 00:02:49.507
So I started to ask the question,
even back then,

00:02:49.531 --> 00:02:52.770
if these environments
didn't know what to do

00:02:52.794 --> 00:02:56.778
with people who didn't fit
a standard mold,

00:02:56.802 --> 00:03:00.417
why weren't we reshaping the environments

00:03:00.441 --> 00:03:02.909
to take advantage of people's strengths?

00:03:05.402 --> 00:03:08.035
What I've come to believe

00:03:08.059 --> 00:03:13.269
is that we need to cultivate
safe and conducive conditions

00:03:13.293 --> 00:03:18.126
for new and innovative ideas
to evolve and thrive.

00:03:19.956 --> 00:03:23.291
We know that humans
are innately innovative,

00:03:23.315 --> 00:03:24.673
because if we weren't,

00:03:24.697 --> 00:03:29.283
we'd all be using the same arrowheads
that we were using 10,000 years ago.

00:03:30.152 --> 00:03:33.818
So one of the things
that I started to question is,

00:03:33.842 --> 00:03:38.097
are there ways to make innovation easier

00:03:38.121 --> 00:03:41.053
and happen more frequently?

00:03:41.523 --> 00:03:44.380
Is there a way to take those aha moments,

00:03:44.404 --> 00:03:50.373
those breakthroughs that seem
to happen randomly and occasionally,

00:03:50.397 --> 00:03:54.039
and have them happen
intentionally and frequently?

00:03:55.316 --> 00:03:58.181
When we started Blue Man Group in 1988,

00:03:58.205 --> 00:04:01.093
we had never done
an off-Broadway show before.

00:04:01.553 --> 00:04:04.030
We'd actually done almost no theater.

00:04:05.086 --> 00:04:08.170
But we knew what we were passionate about,

00:04:08.194 --> 00:04:12.134
and it was a whole series of things
that we had never seen onstage before,

00:04:12.158 --> 00:04:16.358
things like art and pop culture
and technology and sociology

00:04:16.382 --> 00:04:21.834
and anthropology and percussion
and comedy and following your bliss.

00:04:23.698 --> 00:04:25.562
We established a rule

00:04:25.586 --> 00:04:30.864
that nothing made it onstage
if we had seen it before,

00:04:30.888 --> 00:04:34.047
and we wanted to inspire
creativity and connectedness

00:04:34.071 --> 00:04:36.992
in ourselves and our audiences;

00:04:37.016 --> 00:04:39.855
we wanted to do
a little bit of social good,

00:04:39.879 --> 00:04:41.555
and we wanted to have fun doing it.

00:04:42.456 --> 00:04:43.846
And in the office,

00:04:43.870 --> 00:04:47.132
we wanted to create an environment
where people treated each other

00:04:47.156 --> 00:04:49.307
just a little bit better,

00:04:49.331 --> 00:04:52.997
just a little bit more
respect and consideration

00:04:53.021 --> 00:04:54.624
than in the outside world.

00:04:56.740 --> 00:05:01.645
And we continued to iterate
and collaborate and find solutions

00:05:01.669 --> 00:05:04.962
to create things that hadn't been seen.

00:05:06.530 --> 00:05:12.066
Over time, I've come to identify
the optimal conditions

00:05:12.090 --> 00:05:16.328
for these types of creative
and innovative environments

00:05:16.352 --> 00:05:20.356
are clear intent, purpose and passion:

00:05:20.380 --> 00:05:23.614
this is working on something
bigger than ourselves.

00:05:24.730 --> 00:05:26.627
Personal integrity:

00:05:26.651 --> 00:05:29.013
it's doing what we say we're going to do.

00:05:29.037 --> 00:05:32.560
It's being our authentic self
in all interactions.

00:05:32.904 --> 00:05:36.127
Direct communication
and clear expectations,

00:05:36.151 --> 00:05:38.420
even when the subject matter is difficult.

00:05:39.222 --> 00:05:41.167
Grit and perseverance:

00:05:41.191 --> 00:05:44.294
iteration, iteration, iteration.

00:05:46.136 --> 00:05:49.105
Establish collaborative teams.

00:05:49.129 --> 00:05:52.089
Instill deep trust and mutual respect.

00:05:52.686 --> 00:05:54.820
Everyone on your team is in.

00:05:54.844 --> 00:05:56.382
There is no out club.

00:05:57.192 --> 00:06:00.122
We rise as a team, we fall as a team,

00:06:00.146 --> 00:06:03.224
and decisions are decisions
until they're not.

00:06:03.996 --> 00:06:06.082
Embrace multiple perspectives.

00:06:06.488 --> 00:06:10.361
This means all voices matter,
all emotions matter.

00:06:10.385 --> 00:06:12.555
Address disagreements head-on.

00:06:12.579 --> 00:06:15.039
People should feel seen and heard.

00:06:15.509 --> 00:06:18.270
Take risks and celebrate mistakes.

00:06:18.735 --> 00:06:21.557
A commitment to being
a learning organization,

00:06:21.581 --> 00:06:26.961
always trying to spiral upwards
the innovation and learning curves.

00:06:28.389 --> 00:06:30.032
And speak in one voice.

00:06:30.738 --> 00:06:34.778
This is perhaps the glue
that holds all these conditions together.

00:06:35.669 --> 00:06:39.812
The concept is that we speak
in the exact same manner

00:06:39.836 --> 00:06:42.574
about someone who's not in the room

00:06:42.598 --> 00:06:43.947
as if they are in the room.

00:06:45.224 --> 00:06:50.565
Now this seems basic,
but it's an aspirational practice

00:06:50.589 --> 00:06:56.356
that helps deal with difficult situations
in a more respectful way.

00:06:57.521 --> 00:07:02.760
Sewing this practice in can have
a profound effect on raising the bar,

00:07:02.784 --> 00:07:04.895
on mutual respect, trust,

00:07:04.919 --> 00:07:10.451
reducing gossip and politics
in the office and the classroom,

00:07:10.475 --> 00:07:14.697
and thus reducing the noise that gets
in the way of the innovative process.

00:07:16.412 --> 00:07:20.521
At Blue Man Group, iteration
was essential for our creative process.

00:07:20.841 --> 00:07:22.407
We were writing a piece

00:07:22.431 --> 00:07:28.051
where we were trying to illustrate
the consumption / waste loop

00:07:28.075 --> 00:07:33.916
in a funny and creative
and surprising way for our audiences.

00:07:34.667 --> 00:07:41.009
Now, if you have yourselves thought about
trying to do the same endeavor,

00:07:41.033 --> 00:07:43.747
I can save you a lot of time
right here and now.

00:07:44.864 --> 00:07:47.743
I can definitively tell you

00:07:47.767 --> 00:07:52.536
that oatmeal, Jell-O, Cream of Wheat,

00:07:52.560 --> 00:07:58.728
Gak, pudding, clay, tapioca,
Silly Putty and tomato paste

00:07:58.752 --> 00:08:05.181
do not slide through a tube
that's coiled up under your costumes

00:08:05.205 --> 00:08:08.840
that's meant to come out
an orifice in your chest

00:08:08.864 --> 00:08:10.855
and spray towards the audience.

00:08:11.841 --> 00:08:13.000
It won't happen.

00:08:13.024 --> 00:08:14.809
(Laughter)

00:08:15.348 --> 00:08:21.856
After months of iteration,
we finally happened upon bananas.

00:08:21.880 --> 00:08:23.366
(Laughter)

00:08:23.390 --> 00:08:27.430
Who knew that bananas
would have the exact right properties

00:08:27.454 --> 00:08:32.052
to stay solid even when pushed
through a tube with forced air,

00:08:32.076 --> 00:08:38.803
yet slippery enough to have
the dramatic oozing effect

00:08:38.827 --> 00:08:40.470
that we were looking for.

00:08:40.494 --> 00:08:41.812
(Laughter)

00:08:41.836 --> 00:08:45.844
This piece became a signature
of the Blue Man show.

00:08:47.410 --> 00:08:51.307
But we didn't throw out
all the rules of theater altogether.

00:08:51.331 --> 00:08:54.600
We had set designs.
We had lighting designs.

00:08:54.624 --> 00:08:56.885
We had a stage manager calling the shows.

00:08:57.601 --> 00:09:02.371
But I'm fairly sure
we were one of the very first shows

00:09:02.395 --> 00:09:06.459
that was connecting with our audience
in a respectful way,

00:09:06.483 --> 00:09:08.432
by hanging them upside down,

00:09:08.456 --> 00:09:10.930
(Laughter)

00:09:10.954 --> 00:09:13.146
dipping them in paint,

00:09:13.170 --> 00:09:15.353
slamming them against a canvas,

00:09:15.377 --> 00:09:16.542
(Laughter)

00:09:16.566 --> 00:09:20.709
putting their heads
in 70 pounds of Jell-O,

00:09:20.733 --> 00:09:23.608
and then making them
one of the heroes of the show.

00:09:26.699 --> 00:09:29.779
(Laughter)

00:09:29.803 --> 00:09:34.312
Besides that, we didn't reinvent
what didn't need to be reinvented.

00:09:34.336 --> 00:09:41.001
(Laughter)

00:09:41.025 --> 00:09:47.191
Years later, we took all this learning
and we created a school --

00:09:48.693 --> 00:09:54.361
a school for our children
that we wish we had gone to,

00:09:54.385 --> 00:09:58.060
a school where it was just as important

00:09:58.084 --> 00:10:01.290
what happened in the hallways
between classes

00:10:01.314 --> 00:10:03.718
as what happened in the classes;

00:10:04.870 --> 00:10:10.854
a place where you got music class
even when you couldn't sing middle C.

00:10:12.577 --> 00:10:15.197
At Blue School, teachers
and parents and students

00:10:15.221 --> 00:10:17.879
are equal collaborators at the table,

00:10:17.903 --> 00:10:20.649
intentionally creating a safe space

00:10:20.673 --> 00:10:24.776
where they can develop
a lifelong, joyful passion for learning.

00:10:25.705 --> 00:10:29.697
Again, we didn't try to reinvent the wheel
when it didn't need to be reinvented.

00:10:29.721 --> 00:10:32.991
We don't shy away from
the more traditional methods

00:10:33.015 --> 00:10:36.982
like direct instruction,
when it's the best way into a lesson.

00:10:37.006 --> 00:10:43.753
But we balance it with an integrated
learning across all subjects approach,

00:10:43.777 --> 00:10:45.491
and balance is the key.

00:10:46.013 --> 00:10:49.278
In fact, Blue School was founded

00:10:49.302 --> 00:10:55.199
on a balance between academic mastery,
creative thinking,

00:10:55.223 --> 00:10:57.603
and self and social intelligence.

00:10:58.955 --> 00:11:02.200
I realize that this might sound
like common sense,

00:11:02.224 --> 00:11:05.800
but in some circles, this is radical.

00:11:05.824 --> 00:11:07.612
(Laughter)

00:11:08.439 --> 00:11:12.926
And these qualities have brought
a lot of attention to Blue School

00:11:12.950 --> 00:11:15.058
as a truly innovative school.

00:11:17.756 --> 00:11:20.947
Nearly 10 years in,

00:11:20.971 --> 00:11:23.923
we announced the expansion
of the middle school.

00:11:23.947 --> 00:11:26.789
Our faculty asked our sixth graders

00:11:26.813 --> 00:11:29.851
to participate in the development
of middle school values.

00:11:30.527 --> 00:11:33.336
Their process began with a question:

00:11:33.360 --> 00:11:39.629
What do you need from our community
to be happy and productive at school?

00:11:40.741 --> 00:11:45.900
Students moved through a six-week process
of individual work, collaborative work,

00:11:45.924 --> 00:11:48.289
refinement, and consensus,

00:11:48.313 --> 00:11:53.670
and the list they came up with
is really extraordinary.

00:11:55.600 --> 00:11:58.996
Be engaged and present with each other.

00:12:01.442 --> 00:12:06.648
Respect and support
what others need in order to learn.

00:12:08.804 --> 00:12:12.003
Be inclusive of our diversity --

00:12:12.027 --> 00:12:15.367
the way we look, think and act.

00:12:17.614 --> 00:12:22.558
Cultivate the practice of self-awareness
and awareness of others.

00:12:23.623 --> 00:12:26.599
Honor and make time for fun and joy.

00:12:28.147 --> 00:12:30.521
And challenge ourselves,

00:12:30.545 --> 00:12:32.782
practice being OK,

00:12:32.806 --> 00:12:34.743
making mistakes,

00:12:34.767 --> 00:12:36.790
and support each other through them.

00:12:39.273 --> 00:12:44.225
Remember, these kids were 11 years old
when they came up with this.

00:12:45.146 --> 00:12:50.502
They articulated what took us
20 years to identify.

00:12:53.943 --> 00:13:00.254
One of the great by-products
of creating these vibrant communities

00:13:00.278 --> 00:13:06.833
is that we become attractors for people
who want to prioritize these values.

00:13:09.996 --> 00:13:15.779
They want to prioritize it above things
like money and prestige and tradition.

00:13:16.475 --> 00:13:19.841
We can all be on this road together,

00:13:19.865 --> 00:13:23.056
you at your own values
in your own companies,

00:13:23.080 --> 00:13:25.445
in your own communities and families.

00:13:26.470 --> 00:13:32.129
For us, for me, it was about
prioritizing children's voices

00:13:32.153 --> 00:13:37.875
to give them the tools to help build
a harmonious and sustainable world.

00:13:39.052 --> 00:13:44.041
I invite you to be on this exciting,

00:13:44.065 --> 00:13:47.448
passionate, joyful journey together.

00:13:48.855 --> 00:13:52.578
And together, good as can be expected

00:13:52.602 --> 00:13:56.921
is limitless when the expectation

00:13:56.945 --> 00:14:00.810
is that by reshaping our environments,

00:14:00.834 --> 00:14:02.341
we can change the world.

00:14:04.040 --> 00:14:05.191
Thank you.

00:14:05.215 --> 00:14:10.777
