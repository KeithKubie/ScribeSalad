00:00:00.489 --> 00:00:05.950
There are couples that seem never to argue.
Their relationships are marked by enormous

00:00:05.950 --> 00:00:11.000
outward politeness; they say thank you a lot;
they make each other cups of tea; they can

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:15.809
look rather horrified when there’s a mention
of a squabble in someone else’s life. It’s

00:00:15.809 --> 00:00:21.750
understandable if they’re privately a little
pleased with themselves. But surface harmony

00:00:21.750 --> 00:00:26.990
isn’t, in reality, any reliable sign of
health in love because it’s impossible to

00:00:26.990 --> 00:00:33.550
try to merge two lives without regularly encountering
deep sources of incompatibility. A lack of

00:00:33.550 --> 00:00:38.310
arguments is more likely to be a sign that
we have given up caring than a superhuman

00:00:38.310 --> 00:00:44.220
achievement of maturity. The goal isn’t,
therefore, to do away with arguments – but

00:00:44.220 --> 00:00:49.860
to find our way towards their more fruitful
variety. We need to learn to argue well, rather

00:00:49.860 --> 00:00:52.240
than not argue at all.

00:00:52.240 --> 00:00:59.050
What then are some of the ideas that might
help us have better arguments? 1. The single

00:00:59.050 --> 00:01:04.409
greatest idea that can help us to argue more
constructively is to remind ourselves publicly

00:01:04.409 --> 00:01:11.380
that we are – both of us – by nature deeply
imperfect and at points quite plainly mad.

00:01:11.380 --> 00:01:17.049
The enemy of mature arguments is self-righteousness:
the sense that we might be beyond fault and

00:01:17.049 --> 00:01:22.179
that our partner must be either wicked for
making a mistake or unfairly critical in alleging

00:01:22.179 --> 00:01:27.810
that we have been guilty of one. It is of
immense benefit if relationships can be conducted

00:01:27.810 --> 00:01:33.630
under the assumed truth that both participants
are idiotic, mentally wobbly, quite flawed

00:01:33.630 --> 00:01:39.729
in manifold ways – and constantly in need
of forgiveness. It’s an implicit faith in

00:01:39.729 --> 00:01:46.670
our own perfection that turns us into monsters.
2. People concede points not when they’re

00:01:46.670 --> 00:01:52.679
aggressively told they’re wrong; but when
they feel loved. We get stubborn and withhold

00:01:52.679 --> 00:01:57.520
the truth when we’re scared and suspect
that the person challenging us hates us, means

00:01:57.520 --> 00:02:03.389
us harm, can never forgive us – and is perhaps
about to leave us. It is indispensable to

00:02:03.389 --> 00:02:10.250
preface every criticism with an assurance
of our ongoing love. 3. People change very

00:02:10.250 --> 00:02:16.750
slowly, and seldom when they are harassed
into doing so. We must strive not to be desperate

00:02:16.750 --> 00:02:22.670
for change. We must make our peace with the
idea that they won’t evolve as we would

00:02:22.670 --> 00:02:27.740
wish on the timescale that would suit us;
we should be rather pessimistic about human

00:02:27.740 --> 00:02:34.430
nature in order to encounter one or two grounds
for hope. 4. We shouldn’t aggravate our

00:02:34.430 --> 00:02:40.480
frustration by a sense that we have been uniquely
cursed in ending up in this relationship.

00:02:40.480 --> 00:02:46.930
Of course they are annoying. Everyone in the
world would be equally tricky at times and

00:02:46.930 --> 00:02:52.850
often probably a lot worse. The specifics
of why we’re in an irritating dispute may

00:02:52.850 --> 00:03:00.600
be local but that we are in one is a universal
destiny. We should laugh darkly at the human

00:03:00.600 --> 00:03:01.770
tragedy.

00:03:01.770 --> 00:03:07.790
5. Our partner is only ever frightened, worried
and not thinking straight – rather than

00:03:07.790 --> 00:03:14.540
bad. Just like us, they carry a lot of emotional
baggage: they have been shaped by their complex

00:03:14.540 --> 00:03:20.370
and at moments very troubled history. Much
of what they do isn’t directly about us

00:03:20.370 --> 00:03:26.490
but is a way of coping with difficulties that
came into their life long before we met them.

00:03:26.490 --> 00:03:32.900
6. Choose the moment. We can be under the
illusion that arguing is an exchange of intellectual

00:03:32.900 --> 00:03:39.400
ideas. But it’s largely a process reliant
on our emotions and is decisively influenced

00:03:39.400 --> 00:03:43.760
by such easily-overlooked matters as how much
sleep we’ve had, how much we’ve drunk

00:03:43.760 --> 00:03:51.401
and what time it is. As a general rule, wait
till tomorrow. 7. Don’t let the relationship

00:03:51.401 --> 00:03:57.680
die from misplaced ‘politeness’ or embarrassment.
Dare to name the problem, however shocking

00:03:57.680 --> 00:04:03.100
it sounds. As long as it’s been carefully
wrapped in layers of love, the truth is normally

00:04:03.100 --> 00:04:10.660
bearable to those who care for us. 8. It doesn’t
matter if we’re right. We must be prepared

00:04:10.660 --> 00:04:15.810
to forego all the pleasures of proving a point.
We’re not not trying to ‘win’ but to

00:04:15.810 --> 00:04:22.200
live as happily as possible with another person
who is, in the end, our best friend and on

00:04:22.200 --> 00:04:28.449
our side. Despite this, we will still have
furious rows of course, we will call each

00:04:28.449 --> 00:04:34.900
other the worst things, slam doors and cry.
It’s hugely normal. The capacity to be horrible

00:04:34.900 --> 00:04:40.139
to a partner is even a strange – though
genuine – feature of love. A relationship

00:04:40.139 --> 00:04:46.080
has to include the madder, more unreasonable
parts of our nature; if we are only ever polite,

00:04:46.080 --> 00:04:52.629
it’s because we have not been made to feel
safe. A row may have to be the turbulent passage

00:04:52.629 --> 00:04:59.189
towards the kind of deeper reconciliation
we long for. It can be important to say some

00:04:59.189 --> 00:05:05.710
wild and hurtful things to halt a drift apart.
By foregrounding for a while the most extreme

00:05:05.710 --> 00:05:11.979
points of conflict, we set up the conditions
for reconnecting with larger areas of closeness.

00:05:11.979 --> 00:05:18.949
We now remember that, despite an evening squabbling
like the frightened, foolish, barely semi-rational

00:05:18.949 --> 00:05:26.340
idiots we are, we love them deeply nevertheless
– and will strive with all our will (and

00:05:26.400 --> 00:05:32.640
the help of the odd film like this) to argue
a little more sensibly next time.

00:05:36.480 --> 00:05:43.840
