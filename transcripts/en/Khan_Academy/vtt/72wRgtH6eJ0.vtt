Brian: It's Brian Lehrer Live.

00:00:03.700 --> 00:00:07.583
For decades futurists have been
predicting that education would be

00:00:07.583 --> 00:00:10.565
revolutionized by
computers and the internet.

00:00:10.643 --> 00:00:15.598
First we heard lots about
putting libraries online then
computers in the classroom.

00:00:15.598 --> 00:00:19.123
Then universities like MIT
offering free courseware,

00:00:19.123 --> 00:00:22.854
but nobody figured on a
young man named Salman Khan.

00:00:23.120 --> 00:00:28.091
His site teaches math, science, history
and more to hundreds of thousands

00:00:28.091 --> 00:00:31.194
worldwide and it's all free.

00:00:32.595 --> 00:00:37.232
Salman: The Khan Academy is most known for
what's now about 1000 videos on Youtube.

00:00:37.348 --> 00:00:40.047
It starts literally at 1 + 1
= 2 and it goes all the way

00:00:40.047 --> 00:00:43.232
up to college level calculus and physics.

00:00:43.740 --> 00:00:48.949
Everything is in these very short
encapsulated videos one concept at a time.

00:00:50.678 --> 00:00:54.051
My cousin Nadia was visiting me from
New Orleans when I was in Boston

00:00:54.051 --> 00:00:55.339
and she was having trouble with math.

00:00:55.339 --> 00:00:56.691
She was in sixth grade at the time.

00:00:56.691 --> 00:00:58.816
I agreed to do this
remote tutoring with her.

00:00:58.816 --> 00:01:01.261
So I started putting up videos
on Youtube, and before I knew it

00:01:01.261 --> 00:01:03.978
random people all over the world
started watching them and sending

00:01:03.978 --> 00:01:06.633
me letters and testimonials and I
started getting excited about it

00:01:06.633 --> 00:01:08.101
and I just kept going.

00:01:09.194 --> 00:01:11.927
Man black jacket: I think I've learned
more about math in the past three weeks

00:01:11.927 --> 00:01:15.004
than I had in all four years
of my high school studies.

00:01:15.154 --> 00:01:18.045
Man red hat: When you watch them
you just comprehend everything.

00:01:18.045 --> 00:01:19.136
You just get it.

00:01:19.182 --> 00:01:21.505
Man black shirt: I ended up passing a
whole bunch of tests from his videos.

00:01:21.505 --> 00:01:22.942
Salman: One thing that kind of shocked me,

00:01:22.942 --> 00:01:23.952
I get a lot of letters
from the Middle East.

00:01:23.952 --> 00:01:27.642
I get a lot of letters from
Latin America, Ethiopia, Uganda.

00:01:27.642 --> 00:01:32.392
It's really reached far more students
than I could have ever imagined.

00:01:32.392 --> 00:01:34.689
Right now there are about 1000 videos.

00:01:34.689 --> 00:01:36.864
I started recording them
about three years ago.

00:01:36.864 --> 00:01:38.519
Now I'm doing it full-time.

00:01:38.519 --> 00:01:41.658
I'm hoping to be able to put out
a couple of hundred videos a year.

00:01:42.134 --> 00:01:45.310
I see a world where literally anyone with
access to a computer and the internet

00:01:45.310 --> 00:01:48.533
will be able to go to the Khan Academy
and get a world class education.

00:01:50.024 --> 00:01:51.110
Brian: Impressive right?

00:01:51.110 --> 00:01:54.658
So, let's get to know the man behind
this virtual global classroom.

00:01:54.682 --> 00:01:57.943
Joining us live via Skype
from Mountain View California,

00:01:57.943 --> 00:02:01.935
Khan Academy founder, Salman Khan.

00:02:01.935 --> 00:02:03.605
Hey Salman. Hello from New York.

00:02:03.605 --> 00:02:04.941
Thanks for doing this with us.

00:02:04.941 --> 00:02:06.659
Salman: Hi Brian. Good to be here.

00:02:06.659 --> 00:02:11.072
Brian: I gather you believe you're a
better teacher on video than in person.

00:02:11.273 --> 00:02:12.239
Is that correct?

00:02:12.769 --> 00:02:17.096
Salman: That's what my cousins
first told me when I put up
the very first Youtube video.

00:02:17.519 --> 00:02:20.186
I viewed it as a bit of
a backhanded compliment.

00:02:20.186 --> 00:02:25.645
I was doing these remote tutoring
sessions, these virtual sessions with them

00:02:25.645 --> 00:02:29.767
and I think what they liked
about the Youtube version
of me as opposed to the live

00:02:29.767 --> 00:02:34.049
version of me is that they
didn't have the stress of feeling
like their cousin in Boston

00:02:34.049 --> 00:02:38.395
was judging them or that they had
to answer questions immediately

00:02:38.395 --> 00:02:44.298
or fear feeling or looking
stupid to the instructor and
that they could watch and pause

00:02:44.298 --> 00:02:45.938
and repeat whatever they wanted to.

00:02:45.938 --> 00:02:50.893
Brian: 1500 videos, 14-million views.

00:02:50.893 --> 00:02:52.975
What's the genesis of this Salman?

00:02:52.975 --> 00:02:57.903
Salman: Just like I just said, it started
with me tutoring my cousins remotely.

00:02:57.903 --> 00:03:02.689
They were in New Orleans, I was in Boston
and it worked out really well for them

00:03:02.689 --> 00:03:05.188
when I had one or two or
three that I was tutoring.

00:03:05.188 --> 00:03:07.844
They started doing well so I
wanted to tutor more and more.

00:03:07.844 --> 00:03:09.021
I had a day job.

00:03:09.021 --> 00:03:13.359
I was an analyst at a hedge fund at the
time and the logistics got difficult

00:03:13.359 --> 00:03:16.691
and I thought well it at least would
be nice, maybe I could scale myself up

00:03:16.691 --> 00:03:21.356
a little bit if I made some Youtube
videos and as you just mentioned,

00:03:21.356 --> 00:03:23.776
their initial feedback, I thought
it would be nice to have suppliment

00:03:23.776 --> 00:03:25.965
something they could
use to review concepts.

00:03:25.965 --> 00:03:29.606
It wouldn't be as good as our live
interactions, but the first feedback

00:03:29.606 --> 00:03:32.716
I heard from them was that
it was actually better.

00:03:32.716 --> 00:03:35.658
Brian: Let's see an
example of you teaching.

00:03:35.746 --> 00:03:40.056
This in particular is you teaching,
of all things, differential equations.

00:03:42.379 --> 00:03:46.526
Salman: And what's interesting here and
how this is a departure from what we've

00:03:46.526 --> 00:03:48.799
learned before about regular equations.

00:03:48.799 --> 00:03:52.518
Let me write down a regular equation
just to remind you what they look like.

00:03:52.549 --> 00:03:55.760
So a regular equation if we had one
variable would look something like this.

00:03:55.760 --> 00:04:03.564
I don't know, X squared plus the cosine
of X is equal to the square root of X.

00:04:03.564 --> 00:04:04.554
I just made that up.

00:04:04.951 --> 00:04:08.609
Here the solution is a number or
sometimes it's a set of numbers.

00:04:08.694 --> 00:04:10.223
Sometimes there's more than one right?

00:04:10.223 --> 00:04:14.441
If you have a polynomial you
could have more than one value
of X that satisfy this equation.

00:04:15.366 --> 00:04:20.058
Here for a differential equation,
the solution is a function.

00:04:20.058 --> 00:04:25.947
Our goal is to figure out what function
of X, and here I wrote F of X explicitly

00:04:25.947 --> 00:04:32.923
but what function of X
explicitly satisfies this
relationship or this equation.

00:04:32.923 --> 00:04:34.977
So let me show you what I mean by that.

00:04:34.977 --> 00:04:41.445
I have my differential equations book from
college so I'm going to use that as we go.

00:04:41.478 --> 00:04:45.768
Brian: Ah, that high school
math feeling. There it is.

00:04:45.768 --> 00:04:49.266
Salman: (laughing) That was
well beyond high school math.

00:04:49.266 --> 00:04:50.392
Brian: I guess.

00:04:50.392 --> 00:04:55.458
How do you approach - I mean okay you
came out of hedge funds, whatever.

00:04:55.458 --> 00:04:58.311
Were you an expert in
differential equations?

00:04:58.311 --> 00:05:03.672
Salman: An expert is kind of a loaded word
especially when you think about things

00:05:03.672 --> 00:05:05.791
in academic topics.

00:05:06.114 --> 00:05:10.843
I'm not a cutting edge researcher at the
leading edge of differential equations.

00:05:10.843 --> 00:05:13.055
I have not contributed to the
field of differential equations.

00:05:13.508 --> 00:05:15.696
But I am someone who loved math.

00:05:15.696 --> 00:05:17.701
I was into math in high school, college.

00:05:17.701 --> 00:05:23.306
I was a math major, but I teach things
outside of my credentialed areas as well.

00:05:23.590 --> 00:05:26.085
The way I see it is as
long as someone has -

00:05:26.085 --> 00:05:30.539
I think what I bring to the table is
being able to connect the intuition behind

00:05:30.539 --> 00:05:34.669
a lot of concepts and be able to
communicate it in a way that I wish it was

00:05:34.669 --> 00:05:36.006
delivered to me the first time.

00:05:36.006 --> 00:05:37.251
That's really what I'm trying to do.

00:05:37.251 --> 00:05:39.148
Brian: And you do all of these yourself?

00:05:39.148 --> 00:05:43.255
All 1500 videos in every subject is you.

00:05:43.255 --> 00:05:45.119
Salman: It's all me.

00:05:45.119 --> 00:05:47.504
I joke I'm the faculty
of the Khan Academy.

00:05:47.504 --> 00:05:51.639
Brian: Are there subjects that
are harder for you to do well?

00:05:52.625 --> 00:05:57.585
Salman: You know, I like challenging
myself because when I started doing this

00:05:57.585 --> 00:06:00.335
a lot of people said okay you've done
some algebra, can you do calculus?

00:06:00.335 --> 00:06:03.003
Once you do calculus can you do chemistry?

00:06:03.003 --> 00:06:05.008
And once you do chemistry
can you do the humanities.

00:06:05.008 --> 00:06:09.760
I always like pushing the
boundaries and I just naturally
like learning different topics.

00:06:09.760 --> 00:06:15.093
I wouldn't say harder is the word
but it requires more prep on my part

00:06:15.093 --> 00:06:19.079
to do something like the French
Revolution than it does to do say the

00:06:19.079 --> 00:06:20.205
differential equations videos.

00:06:20.598 --> 00:06:21.898
Brian: Do you have a business model?

00:06:21.898 --> 00:06:23.445
You give these away for free right?

00:06:23.445 --> 00:06:27.525
Salman: Yeah. The decision was
made actually before I even quit

00:06:27.525 --> 00:06:31.359
my job to make this a not for profit
entity, make sure it stays focused

00:06:31.359 --> 00:06:34.169
on its goal which is to give
education away for free.

00:06:34.169 --> 00:06:37.114
The way I'm paying my bills -

00:06:37.114 --> 00:06:40.989
I was living off savings when I
quit my job in September in 2009,

00:06:40.989 --> 00:06:44.081
and until recently I was
essentially just living off savings,

00:06:44.081 --> 00:06:48.986
but very recently we've gotten enough
donations to support a small salary for me

00:06:48.986 --> 00:06:51.778
and give us a bit of our own way
and hopefully we'll get more.

00:06:53.762 --> 00:06:58.659
Brian: Is the paid university
concept an old fashioned concept
as far as your concerned?

00:06:58.748 --> 00:07:03.551
Or is this just an alternative
for a very select group of people?

00:07:04.667 --> 00:07:05.994
Salman: Well it's
definitely an alternative.

00:07:05.994 --> 00:07:08.311
I don't think it's an alternative
for a select group of people.

00:07:08.311 --> 00:07:13.378
When you look at the user base
there's people who are gifted students

00:07:13.378 --> 00:07:14.378
who want to race ahead.

00:07:14.378 --> 00:07:16.876
There's a lot of college students
at all different skill levels.

00:07:16.876 --> 00:07:18.215
There are homeschoolers using it.

00:07:18.215 --> 00:07:19.657
There are retirees using it.

00:07:19.657 --> 00:07:21.949
So I wouldn't say it's selective.

00:07:21.949 --> 00:07:23.359
It's a fairly broad audience.

00:07:23.359 --> 00:07:25.362
And it's at minimum that.

00:07:25.362 --> 00:07:27.909
It's at minimum kind of nice to have.

00:07:27.909 --> 00:07:30.903
In terms of the college experience
I think there are things the
colleges are doing right.

00:07:30.903 --> 00:07:33.369
I think its nice to go to a campus
that's well manicured and have

00:07:33.369 --> 00:07:36.585
a nice experience there, but I
think this does challenge some of

00:07:36.585 --> 00:07:42.141
the notions of why do we have these
300-person lectures at some university.

00:07:42.141 --> 00:07:44.172
Actually, at all universities you
have these 300-person lectures

00:07:44.172 --> 00:07:47.215
when you can get on demand
instruction at your own pace,

00:07:47.215 --> 00:07:48.716
when you want it.

00:07:48.951 --> 00:07:51.361
You don't have to take notes.
It's always there for you.

00:07:51.446 --> 00:07:53.246
Brian: Who are your users primarily?

00:07:53.246 --> 00:07:56.638
I realize it's a diverse group, but
do you find certain kinds of people,

00:07:56.638 --> 00:08:03.966
certain groups of people are
really hitting on your stuff
for certain uses in their lives?

00:08:04.720 --> 00:08:06.723
Salman: Yeah, I mean the core
users are who you would expect.

00:08:06.723 --> 00:08:11.510
It's I would say high school and
college students, mainly in the US,

00:08:11.510 --> 00:08:12.438
mainly North America.

00:08:12.438 --> 00:08:14.746
I'd say about 80% North America,
20% the rest of the world.

00:08:14.746 --> 00:08:22.444
Brian: For what? As kind of an online
Sparknotes or some other reason?

00:08:22.444 --> 00:08:25.415
Salman: Yeah, I think they're students
who are stuck in a math class,

00:08:25.415 --> 00:08:28.688
either they missed some days, they
zoned out through a couple of lectures

00:08:28.688 --> 00:08:32.141
or they don't connect with the
professor they have and they use this

00:08:32.141 --> 00:08:36.722
either as a supplement or to catch
up or really as their primary source

00:08:36.722 --> 00:08:38.774
of understanding the concepts.

00:08:39.370 --> 00:08:41.893
I get a lot of letters from people
who don't use a textbook anymore

00:08:41.893 --> 00:08:45.591
to learn the concepts, a few people
who don't show up at lecture anymore.

00:08:45.591 --> 00:08:47.173
Brian: But go ahead.
That's one core group.

00:08:47.173 --> 00:08:50.010
Salman: And the others, you
know the homeschoolers love it.

00:08:50.010 --> 00:08:52.349
I didn't think about it at first,
but it's kind of an obvious group

00:08:52.349 --> 00:08:55.514
that would appreciate this type of
thing both for the students directly

00:08:55.514 --> 00:08:57.414
and for the teachers and for the parents.

00:08:57.414 --> 00:08:59.666
I've actually gotten -

00:08:59.666 --> 00:09:04.094
Some groups are using it for teacher
training, which is a compliment.

00:09:05.384 --> 00:09:07.789
It is actually being
used in the classroom.

00:09:07.789 --> 00:09:12.393
I get letters from teachers who are
one assigning the lectures for homework

00:09:12.393 --> 00:09:15.932
instead of reading, and some teachers
are showing it in the classroom

00:09:15.937 --> 00:09:18.406
and then using that as a
starting point for discussion.

00:09:18.913 --> 00:09:24.071
Brian: And you're obviously very
organized about how you do this.

00:09:24.071 --> 00:09:28.933
We're going to show another video,
a little bit of you talking about

00:09:28.933 --> 00:09:32.252
how some of the math and
science videos are organized.

00:09:32.769 --> 00:09:33.723
Salman: Sure.

00:09:36.522 --> 00:09:40.064
And then when you think about
the sciences, we have physics

00:09:40.064 --> 00:09:44.350
and the physics playlist is mainly
I call applied algebra problems.

00:09:44.350 --> 00:09:47.640
So, you might want to watch physics
right around after you finish algebra.

00:09:49.073 --> 00:09:52.376
There's only a few videos
that require calculus.

00:09:52.376 --> 00:09:56.072
I'll eventually make an entire
playlist on calculus-based physics.

00:09:56.100 --> 00:09:59.438
Most of this is just is just algebra-based
physics so you're ready to go if you

00:09:59.438 --> 00:10:02.216
have a good solid
understanding of algebra.

00:10:02.756 --> 00:10:07.215
And then the other sciences, the
chemistry it'd be nice to have algebra

00:10:07.215 --> 00:10:10.156
out of the way prealgebra is
probably enough for most of it.

00:10:10.584 --> 00:10:14.182
Prealgebra is probably enough
for most of it, but if you have
your algebra out of the way

00:10:14.182 --> 00:10:17.424
then you're going to have no trouble
at all with the chemistry playlist.

00:10:18.687 --> 00:10:22.873
Then biology does deal with a little
bit of probability and things like that.

00:10:22.873 --> 00:10:24.432
So, it wouldn't hurt but that's actually,

00:10:24.432 --> 00:10:28.312
that doesn't even require too much
mathematics or at least the mathematics

00:10:28.312 --> 00:10:29.766
that I've diagramed here.

00:10:29.766 --> 00:10:31.406
We could put biology here.

00:10:31.702 --> 00:10:35.221
I guess the big takeaway is that algebra
is really important for pretty much

00:10:35.221 --> 00:10:36.286
anything you want to do.

00:10:36.286 --> 00:10:39.997
There are some genetics
problems that require some
basic level and some population

00:10:39.997 --> 00:10:44.294
genetics problems that
have some biology in it.

00:10:45.031 --> 00:10:49.027
And then all the finance
and economics that also, I
think, it assumes a base level

00:10:49.027 --> 00:10:50.861
of algebraic understanding.

00:10:50.861 --> 00:10:52.291
So the things on banking.

00:10:57.167 --> 00:10:59.685
Brian: So, that's, as I said
very organized, and I guess

00:10:59.685 --> 00:11:01.546
that's the same kind of
thing that any university

00:11:01.546 --> 00:11:05.295
would do as they're figuring out
what's a prerequisite for what.

00:11:05.295 --> 00:11:06.163
Right?

00:11:06.519 --> 00:11:11.820
Salman: Right. That's the general idea,
and actually this video was a biproduct

00:11:11.820 --> 00:11:15.299
of there's so much content on the site now
that I got a lot of requests from people

00:11:15.299 --> 00:11:18.737
who just were kind of lost,
what do I view after what?

00:11:18.737 --> 00:11:23.238
And the one area where I think this
diverges from the university model -

00:11:23.238 --> 00:11:24.652
The university model is very -

00:11:24.652 --> 00:11:27.733
I mean that diagram was kind of class
based but I think what's here is a lot

00:11:27.733 --> 00:11:31.843
more granular so you can
kind of go straight to the
concept based prerequisites

00:11:31.843 --> 00:11:33.583
as opposed to an entire class.

00:11:33.652 --> 00:11:37.819
Brian: Are you interested in trying to
get accredited or is that not a goal?

00:11:37.985 --> 00:11:41.152
Salman: It's a long-term goal maybe to
have some type of direct accreditation.

00:11:41.152 --> 00:11:43.388
I mean I can imagine a world where
actually have a software piece

00:11:43.388 --> 00:11:45.657
where we give people exercises
and things like that, and you know

00:11:45.657 --> 00:11:48.538
at the end of the day, ten years in
the future it might be a lot more

00:11:48.538 --> 00:11:52.986
informative to an employer or university
as opposed to saying you have a 3.9 GPA

00:11:52.986 --> 00:11:55.198
to actually give someone the data
of all of the work that you've done.

00:11:56.321 --> 00:11:59.654
But in the short-term, maybe
the next year or two, I do see
a reality where we can tell

00:11:59.654 --> 00:12:02.739
people, "Look if you've understood
all of these concepts you are ready to

00:12:02.739 --> 00:12:06.815
go take the GED and you're likely to pass
it, or if you take the SAT because of the

00:12:06.815 --> 00:12:09.179
exercises you've done we have
this level of confidence that

00:12:09.179 --> 00:12:11.621
you will get a X on the SAT."

00:12:11.653 --> 00:12:15.156
So we can view the Khan Academy
is kind of your coach and then you

00:12:15.156 --> 00:12:17.456
get your external credential
from some other source.

00:12:18.067 --> 00:12:21.225
Brian: I didn't see you in any
of the videos that we screened.

00:12:21.225 --> 00:12:27.235
Do your students ever see you at a smart
board or with an overhead projector

00:12:27.235 --> 00:12:28.976
or anything like that in these videos?

00:12:29.403 --> 00:12:33.317
Salman: No, and you know the form
factor started off out of me just

00:12:33.317 --> 00:12:39.176
not having a video camera, but
then I got a lot of feedback

00:12:39.176 --> 00:12:41.735
that this form factor actually works
for a lot of people even though now

00:12:41.735 --> 00:12:43.946
I probably could get a video
camera and go at a whiteboard,

00:12:43.946 --> 00:12:45.789
but people say that it
feels a lot more intimate.

00:12:45.789 --> 00:12:48.990
The instructor's face isn't a distraction.

00:12:48.990 --> 00:12:52.024
It's kind of like they
feel like I'm the voice.

00:12:52.024 --> 00:12:54.651
I'm either sitting next to them
and tutoring them or they feel like

00:12:54.651 --> 00:12:57.149
I'm actually inside of
their brain talking to them.

00:12:57.149 --> 00:12:59.402
So I think I'll just stick with that.

00:12:59.403 --> 00:13:01.445
It's actually funny because I've
gotten letters from people who imagine

00:13:01.445 --> 00:13:05.065
me in completely different ways than
I might be and they kind of project

00:13:05.065 --> 00:13:09.200
their own impressions onto
me which is kind of a neat
artifact of this form factor.

00:13:09.483 --> 00:13:13.901
Brian: You said that one of your goals
is to teach the way you always wanted

00:13:13.901 --> 00:13:15.117
to be taught.

00:13:15.360 --> 00:13:16.701
Can you put that into words?

00:13:17.423 --> 00:13:18.925
Salman: Yeah, you know I think it's -

00:13:18.925 --> 00:13:23.187
I'm finding this out more and more
the more concepts I do that there's

00:13:23.187 --> 00:13:27.961
a lot of intuitive connections between
a lot of subjects but I think the

00:13:27.961 --> 00:13:31.939
1000 page text books and then you
know to some degree the beaurocracies

00:13:31.939 --> 00:13:33.945
of the standards making organizations.

00:13:33.945 --> 00:13:38.474
They kind of chop them up to a level
that you lose all of the intuition.

00:13:38.474 --> 00:13:42.283
You lose all of the cross
subject interactions and for me,

00:13:42.283 --> 00:13:46.240
what made math fun, what made
science fun was to really explore

00:13:46.240 --> 00:13:49.189
things and see how different
concepts were connected and what

00:13:49.189 --> 00:13:51.734
a formula is actually
saying about the universe.

00:13:51.734 --> 00:13:55.483
I think people who watch the Khan
Academy they really find I'm not just

00:13:55.483 --> 00:13:56.788
throwing formulas at you.

00:13:56.788 --> 00:13:59.028
I give you an intuition for what the
formula is saying, and I also tell you

00:13:59.028 --> 00:14:02.697
what it's saying about the universe
generally, what are its implications,

00:14:02.697 --> 00:14:05.737
and also how did we get that formula.

00:14:05.737 --> 00:14:09.656
I don't just say memorize it and apply
it, and I think when you start learning

00:14:09.656 --> 00:14:12.837
that way, one it's a lot more fun
because we all actually do want

00:14:12.837 --> 00:14:16.402
to learn about the universe and it
actually builds a really, really strong

00:14:16.402 --> 00:14:19.346
foundation when you learn
more advanced topics.

00:14:19.346 --> 00:14:20.948
Brian: Which are your most popular videos?

00:14:21.692 --> 00:14:23.925
Salman: Introduction to trigonometry is -

00:14:23.925 --> 00:14:24.854
Brian: Really?

00:14:24.854 --> 00:14:28.957
Saman: That or probably
introduction to calculus.

00:14:28.957 --> 00:14:31.933
Those are probably the
two most popular videos.

00:14:31.933 --> 00:14:32.834
Brian: Why?

00:14:33.567 --> 00:14:37.231
Salman: Well, I think both people
take those courses, both people are at

00:14:37.231 --> 00:14:39.696
the same time kind of
intimidated by those courses.

00:14:39.696 --> 00:14:43.305
I think when you watch
those first two videos -

00:14:43.305 --> 00:14:45.949
The introduction to calculus is an
interesting one because I've had

00:14:45.949 --> 00:14:49.852
letters from people who've taken
calculus and who got As in calculus

00:14:49.852 --> 00:14:52.074
and then they watch that video and
they say, "Oh, I finally understand

00:14:52.074 --> 00:14:56.423
what calculus is about,
what's it even good for."

00:14:57.353 --> 00:15:00.404
So there's that, and I think introduction
to trigonometry is a huge pain point

00:15:00.404 --> 00:15:04.267
for a lot of students and so
a lot of them kind of end up
on Youtube looking for help.

00:15:04.267 --> 00:15:06.120
Brian: So, what's the future for you?

00:15:06.152 --> 00:15:09.988
Is it collaboration with others like
you, if there are any others like you

00:15:09.988 --> 00:15:12.036
to continue to grow or something else?

00:15:12.697 --> 00:15:16.880
Salman: You know I'm very open
to it, and when I started off
when I only had 100 videos

00:15:16.880 --> 00:15:20.507
I thought that was the road I would
take, that I would find a team of other

00:15:20.507 --> 00:15:23.486
people like me and we would
just collectively do it.

00:15:23.486 --> 00:15:26.400
I'm open to it but I've
kind of committed myself.

00:15:26.400 --> 00:15:27.491
I enjoy doing it.

00:15:27.491 --> 00:15:32.071
I've done 1500 videos over four
years and most of those four years

00:15:32.071 --> 00:15:33.786
I was working a day job.

00:15:33.786 --> 00:15:36.200
I've done about 600 since
I quit my job in September.

00:15:36.200 --> 00:15:40.822
So I'm fairly confident that I
could tackle a big chunk of it,

00:15:40.822 --> 00:15:42.710
but I'm sure other people will join in.

00:15:43.535 --> 00:15:47.109
But then augment it with software
and kind of a community built

00:15:47.109 --> 00:15:49.623
around the 200,000 people
using the site right now.

00:15:50.437 --> 00:15:52.735
To really turn it into a virtual school.

00:15:53.404 --> 00:15:55.156
Brian: Hey Salman, great
stuff. Thanks for coming on.

00:15:55.156 --> 00:15:57.000
Salman: Great. Thank you.
