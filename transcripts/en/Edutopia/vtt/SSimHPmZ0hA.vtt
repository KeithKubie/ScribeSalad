00:00:11.196 --> 00:00:15.116
&gt;&gt;Joel: Minecraft is a video
game that has a lot to offer.

00:00:15.276 --> 00:00:17.866
At its core, it's very open-ended.

00:00:17.866 --> 00:00:20.726
If you want to have an adventure,
you can have an adventure.

00:00:20.726 --> 00:00:22.616
If you want to build something,
you can build something.

00:00:22.616 --> 00:00:24.856
If you want to talk to your friends,
you can talk to your friends.

00:00:24.856 --> 00:00:26.696
If you want to kill monsters,
you can kill monsters.

00:00:26.846 --> 00:00:29.826
So the game appeals
to a lot of people.

00:00:30.046 --> 00:00:35.466
It makes a lot of sense to take
a game that is already fun,

00:00:35.466 --> 00:00:39.746
that is proven to be enjoyable
to kids, and try to find a way

00:00:39.746 --> 00:00:40.926
to bring it into the classroom.

00:00:42.166 --> 00:00:44.866
&gt;&gt;Lauren: So look here, Minecraft
EDU launcher and that should be it.

00:00:44.866 --> 00:00:44.933
&gt;&gt;Boy: Oh.

00:00:49.116 --> 00:00:53.906
&gt;&gt;Boy: Imagine how long
this took Brandon to make.

00:00:53.906 --> 00:00:53.996
&gt;&gt;Boy: I know.

00:00:53.996 --> 00:00:55.976
Oh! He just drops you
from all the way up there.

00:00:57.296 --> 00:01:00.436
&gt;&gt;Joel: You know, my school as well
as many others have been struggling

00:01:00.436 --> 00:01:03.236
with the issue of how to
teach digital citizenship,

00:01:03.346 --> 00:01:07.206
which is internet ethics, online
safety, privacy, research.

00:01:07.206 --> 00:01:10.776
I mean, it's everything,
because as our kids were getting

00:01:10.776 --> 00:01:12.916
into middle school and
high school we had a lot

00:01:12.916 --> 00:01:14.696
of frankly ugly incidents happen.

00:01:14.696 --> 00:01:17.126
And so, you know, the
school's administration,

00:01:17.126 --> 00:01:20.196
along with the computer
department, decided we really need

00:01:20.196 --> 00:01:22.356
to start teaching this
concepts earlier.

00:01:22.846 --> 00:01:25.686
You know, we're going to treat the
game world as part of the classroom.

00:01:25.686 --> 00:01:28.186
It is a classroom, it's
just in the digital space.

00:01:28.416 --> 00:01:31.976
Almost every single kid finally kind
of came around and sort of got it.

00:01:41.186 --> 00:01:44.106
&gt;&gt;Teacher: Go ahead and let's
start off by getting in,

00:01:44.366 --> 00:01:47.286
following the instructions
that are up onto the board.

00:01:48.386 --> 00:01:50.986
Yeah, you are students,
pick your avatar.

00:01:51.196 --> 00:01:55.626
&gt;&gt;Anthony: Pixel Pushers as a student
project here at the ETC is working

00:01:55.626 --> 00:01:58.726
with Minecraft EDU
to develop a series

00:01:59.026 --> 00:02:00.826
of software features
for their software.

00:02:01.056 --> 00:02:03.606
So our programmers have
been working on a quiz block

00:02:03.636 --> 00:02:06.106
and a lesson review tool to include

00:02:06.106 --> 00:02:11.746
in the Minecraft EDU software while
we're also working on researching how

00:02:11.746 --> 00:02:15.726
and what you can best
teach with Minecraft.

00:02:16.746 --> 00:02:19.296
You can really teach
a wide array of things

00:02:19.356 --> 00:02:20.626
that aren't immediately obvious.

00:02:21.306 --> 00:02:25.636
&gt;&gt;Joel: The kids have to think it's
fun, otherwise what's the point?

00:02:25.966 --> 00:02:31.826
There's plenty of educational
games out there and frankly, very,

00:02:31.826 --> 00:02:34.276
very few of them have ever
been very satisfying for me.

00:02:34.336 --> 00:02:36.176
I never wanted to use
them in my classroom,

00:02:36.176 --> 00:02:37.856
because it smells like school.

00:02:38.046 --> 00:02:39.406
&gt;&gt;Make sure you're using
the right material.

00:02:39.406 --> 00:02:42.366
Make sure you're not using
gravel for the parts that are

00:02:42.536 --> 00:02:45.646
in between the pillars there,
because the gravel will fall.

00:02:46.596 --> 00:02:51.706
Let's check out group two, oh nice,
you've finished, you're almost done

00:02:51.706 --> 00:02:53.286
with one of the hardest
shapes, good job.

00:02:53.556 --> 00:02:55.376
&gt;&gt;Anthony: In our research,
we started out asking,

00:02:55.376 --> 00:02:56.796
"What can Minecraft teach?"

00:02:56.956 --> 00:02:58.986
As we actually started
play testing with students,

00:02:58.986 --> 00:03:01.236
we found that that might
be the wrong question

00:03:01.376 --> 00:03:04.856
and that it's more interesting
to ask how can Minecraft teach?

00:03:05.436 --> 00:03:09.686
&gt;&gt;Dave: The virtual world
of Minecraft I think is fun

00:03:09.736 --> 00:03:14.106
and powerful, you know, for these
kids and I think they get it in a way

00:03:14.106 --> 00:03:16.116
that I think some of their
teachers don't sometimes.

00:03:16.166 --> 00:03:19.696
&gt;&gt;Anthony: I think the most important
thing for someone coming to Minecraft

00:03:20.166 --> 00:03:22.926
from an educational perspective
is to just play the game.

00:03:23.166 --> 00:03:25.926
Just get a feel for
how the game works

00:03:26.506 --> 00:03:28.336
and then perhaps even
more importantly,

00:03:28.516 --> 00:03:29.716
let the students play the game.

00:03:29.856 --> 00:03:33.916
&gt;&gt;Joel: You have to think about where
twenty-first century kids are living.

00:03:33.916 --> 00:03:35.306
I mean, they come here in school,

00:03:35.306 --> 00:03:37.076
but they're texting each
other on the way home.

00:03:37.076 --> 00:03:39.496
And then they're on Facebook and
then they're playing games together.

00:03:39.496 --> 00:03:43.876
It's all a continuum; they
don't separate the conversations

00:03:43.876 --> 00:03:46.486
that they have typed into
Minecraft with the ones

00:03:46.486 --> 00:03:47.666
that they have in the lunchroom.

00:03:48.516 --> 00:03:52.316
[ children chattering ]

00:03:52.816 --> 00:03:56.756
&gt;&gt;Joel: There's such
excitement around this game.

00:03:57.056 --> 00:04:01.466
Getting that excitement into
schools all over the world.

00:04:01.506 --> 00:04:05.616
The more voices we have coming
up with idea and creating content

00:04:05.616 --> 00:04:06.976
and sharing content, the better.
