For our Chapter Readings and Current Events,
we actually respond online before we come

00:00:15.360 --> 00:00:19.790
to the classroom, and that's really interesting
because as the leaders of the discussion,

00:00:19.790 --> 00:00:23.790
you get to read everyone's opinions on everything.

00:00:23.790 --> 00:00:28.520
And that's really unique... in that the students
may not do that.

00:00:28.520 --> 00:00:32.870
And you can see as a class where everyone
stands.

00:00:32.870 --> 00:00:36.650
And it's really interesting just to learn
everyone's different backgrounds, the diversity

00:00:36.650 --> 00:00:38.751
of the class, and the opinions they have on
education.

00:00:38.751 --> 00:00:44.480
I think that it's good because you can kind
of see where the conversation will go; it's

00:00:44.480 --> 00:00:45.480
not just...

00:00:45.480 --> 00:00:49.710
I mean we have the format where we have three
questions asked, and then we have each person

00:00:49.710 --> 00:00:50.710
respond.

00:00:50.710 --> 00:00:55.880
But, it's even better to see how people respond
to each other in their posts, where you can

00:00:55.880 --> 00:01:02.190
have one person just say like, "According
to what Christina said, she brought up a really

00:01:02.190 --> 00:01:04.699
interesting point, but here's my reaction.'

00:01:04.699 --> 00:01:10.130
You can't really get that if you just stick
to the same three questions, or the same format.

00:01:10.130 --> 00:01:15.640
It kind of takes also the student's part to
bounce off of each other."
