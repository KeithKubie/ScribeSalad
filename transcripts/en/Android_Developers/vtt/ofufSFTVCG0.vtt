00:00:00.500 --> 00:00:02.970
SHAZIA MAKHDUMI: It's been
about, I think 15 months-- wow,

00:00:02.970 --> 00:00:07.800
time flies-- since we launched
a separate section in the Play

00:00:07.800 --> 00:00:09.630
Store just for families.

00:00:09.630 --> 00:00:12.630
And since then we've built a
lot more products and services

00:00:12.630 --> 00:00:13.437
for this audience.

00:00:13.437 --> 00:00:15.270
So I'll share some of
those things with you,

00:00:15.270 --> 00:00:19.530
as well as insights on what
we have sort of gleaned

00:00:19.530 --> 00:00:22.050
from this 15 months of stuff.

00:00:22.050 --> 00:00:25.140
So families are a very important
and strategic audience,

00:00:25.140 --> 00:00:26.490
and we all know that, right?

00:00:26.490 --> 00:00:28.980
And they're both important
and strategic to Google,

00:00:28.980 --> 00:00:33.090
but also especially to Play.

00:00:33.090 --> 00:00:39.030
Most of the families, most
of the world's population

00:00:39.030 --> 00:00:42.690
lives in family-based
households, right?

00:00:42.690 --> 00:00:46.530
And as we can see,
just in the US alone,

00:00:46.530 --> 00:00:49.680
the family, the
device usage, both

00:00:49.680 --> 00:00:53.310
for smartphones and
tablets, is much higher

00:00:53.310 --> 00:00:56.920
in houses which
have minor children.

00:00:56.920 --> 00:01:00.690
In fact, those households
also-- their families

00:01:00.690 --> 00:01:03.930
tend to use their mobile devices
a lot more for purchasing goods

00:01:03.930 --> 00:01:06.840
and services or playing games.

00:01:06.840 --> 00:01:09.900
And it is not just
the sheer numbers

00:01:09.900 --> 00:01:11.370
of families that matter here.

00:01:11.370 --> 00:01:13.450
It is also how they
use technology.

00:01:13.450 --> 00:01:15.450
We've done a lot of surveys
of parents and kids,

00:01:15.450 --> 00:01:18.450
and in fact, overwhelmingly
kids say technology

00:01:18.450 --> 00:01:19.450
is a part of their life.

00:01:19.450 --> 00:01:21.600
And it's one of the best
parts about being a kid.

00:01:21.600 --> 00:01:26.430
And one such kid is Mattheus,
who is a 10-year-old in Canada.

00:01:26.430 --> 00:01:29.160
And he loves Rubik's Cubes.

00:01:29.160 --> 00:01:32.820
And he's using technology
to create a contraption

00:01:32.820 --> 00:01:35.220
to help him solve Rubik's Cubes.

00:01:35.220 --> 00:01:39.120
And it's just one example of how
kids, and therefore households

00:01:39.120 --> 00:01:41.010
that have kids,
really experience

00:01:41.010 --> 00:01:42.270
technology in a different way.

00:01:44.940 --> 00:01:48.000
And that's why we
created experiences just

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:51.000
for families in the Play Store.

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:52.890
So as I said last year,
about 15 months ago,

00:01:52.890 --> 00:01:55.800
we launched a separate
destination on the Play Store

00:01:55.800 --> 00:01:57.040
just for families.

00:01:57.040 --> 00:01:59.160
And then in a
major store update,

00:01:59.160 --> 00:02:01.080
we brought that
front and center.

00:02:01.080 --> 00:02:04.800
So on the main
store, users can just

00:02:04.800 --> 00:02:06.510
click-- parents
can click on that

00:02:06.510 --> 00:02:09.580
and basically see all
the content for families.

00:02:09.580 --> 00:02:11.280
At the end of last
year, we launched

00:02:11.280 --> 00:02:16.650
a family music plan where up
to six members in a family

00:02:16.650 --> 00:02:20.190
can share purchased
music for $14.99.

00:02:20.190 --> 00:02:22.470
And when you think
about stuff that you

00:02:22.470 --> 00:02:25.740
want to share with families,
or do with families, right,

00:02:25.740 --> 00:02:28.290
there's a lot of
sort of exploring,

00:02:28.290 --> 00:02:30.240
learning new things together.

00:02:30.240 --> 00:02:33.840
You know, I know with my kids,
I love cooking or traveling.

00:02:33.840 --> 00:02:35.466
You want to make
sharing really easy.

00:02:35.466 --> 00:02:36.840
And that's why a
couple of months

00:02:36.840 --> 00:02:38.970
ago we launched
the Family Library.

00:02:38.970 --> 00:02:43.290
And what this does is allows
you as a family, again,

00:02:43.290 --> 00:02:46.440
up to six people, to
share purchased apps

00:02:46.440 --> 00:02:49.680
and games, movies,
TV shows, books,

00:02:49.680 --> 00:02:51.186
with members in your family.

00:02:51.186 --> 00:02:52.560
And from a developer
perspective,

00:02:52.560 --> 00:02:55.980
what this does for you is,
it increases your engagement

00:02:55.980 --> 00:02:57.000
and reach.

00:02:57.000 --> 00:02:59.730
And for users, it gives
them a great experience

00:02:59.730 --> 00:03:01.531
as a family on Play.

00:03:01.531 --> 00:03:03.030
And one of the best
parts about this

00:03:03.030 --> 00:03:06.390
is when someone is setting
up that family account,

00:03:06.390 --> 00:03:08.550
they actually put down
a family credit card

00:03:08.550 --> 00:03:10.510
as a family form of payment.

00:03:10.510 --> 00:03:13.020
And as we all know, that's
one of the biggest hurdles

00:03:13.020 --> 00:03:15.330
or friction points
in the purchase flow.

00:03:15.330 --> 00:03:17.530
So now that they have
it in there already,

00:03:17.530 --> 00:03:19.624
they are more prone to
hopefully making purchases.

00:03:23.719 --> 00:03:24.760
So now let's shift gears.

00:03:24.760 --> 00:03:26.930
We're talking about what's
important to families.

00:03:26.930 --> 00:03:32.030
What content do families
care about, right?

00:03:32.030 --> 00:03:34.250
And as all of us who
are part of a family

00:03:34.250 --> 00:03:36.860
think about, one thing I
think remains constant,

00:03:36.860 --> 00:03:40.040
no matter where you are--
developed world, emerging,

00:03:40.040 --> 00:03:44.360
rich, poor, rural, or
urban-- most, you know,

00:03:44.360 --> 00:03:48.890
parents want to raise their
kids to be happy, productive,

00:03:48.890 --> 00:03:50.150
successful.

00:03:50.150 --> 00:03:53.180
And how do we help them do that?

00:03:53.180 --> 00:03:56.940
So, anyone know kids who
are starting school now?

00:03:56.940 --> 00:03:58.730
It's the back to school season.

00:03:58.730 --> 00:04:03.990
Which year are they going to
be graduating from college?

00:04:03.990 --> 00:04:04.863
Quick math here.

00:04:07.920 --> 00:04:10.390
2033.

00:04:10.390 --> 00:04:13.200
And I guess depending on
how many years of school

00:04:13.200 --> 00:04:15.540
there are, but at
least in the US, 2033.

00:04:15.540 --> 00:04:17.660
And you think about, what
are they going to be?

00:04:17.660 --> 00:04:20.230
Yes, they'll be doctors, they'll
be scientists, engineers,

00:04:20.230 --> 00:04:21.200
what have you.

00:04:21.200 --> 00:04:24.050
But research shows
60% of those jobs

00:04:24.050 --> 00:04:26.250
have not been invented yet.

00:04:26.250 --> 00:04:28.070
So then here's the conundrum.

00:04:28.070 --> 00:04:30.860
If there are jobs that
haven't been invented,

00:04:30.860 --> 00:04:33.130
and technologies
haven't been created,

00:04:33.130 --> 00:04:36.240
and we don't even know which
problems we're trying to solve,

00:04:36.240 --> 00:04:38.330
how do you help
these kids grow up?

00:04:38.330 --> 00:04:41.960
How do you use technology to
help them be happy, productive,

00:04:41.960 --> 00:04:43.200
successful?

00:04:43.200 --> 00:04:43.700
Right?

00:04:43.700 --> 00:04:47.930
So one thing though, is always
good to know and reassuring

00:04:47.930 --> 00:04:50.780
with all this uncertainty,
kids will always be kids.

00:04:50.780 --> 00:04:53.780
Which means they will
be insatiably curious,

00:04:53.780 --> 00:04:57.170
and that is really helpful,
as you know, they need to be.

00:04:57.170 --> 00:05:01.460
So as we start thinking about,
as parents, as educators,

00:05:01.460 --> 00:05:04.190
as developers, as you
know, the whole community,

00:05:04.190 --> 00:05:06.500
how do we prepare
this next generation

00:05:06.500 --> 00:05:09.470
for those challenges,
and how can technology

00:05:09.470 --> 00:05:10.760
play a role in that?

00:05:10.760 --> 00:05:13.970
Google commissioned the
Economist Intelligence Unit

00:05:13.970 --> 00:05:15.650
to do a survey to
understand what

00:05:15.650 --> 00:05:18.290
are those skills that those kids
will need for those jobs that

00:05:18.290 --> 00:05:19.430
don't exist today.

00:05:19.430 --> 00:05:21.680
So I'd love to get your
thoughts, any thoughts on kind

00:05:21.680 --> 00:05:22.346
of what came up.

00:05:22.346 --> 00:05:24.680
And by the way,
feel free, I want

00:05:24.680 --> 00:05:26.440
to make this more interactive.

00:05:26.440 --> 00:05:28.920
And [INAUDIBLE] ask
a lot of questions.

00:05:28.920 --> 00:05:31.610
Anyone?

00:05:31.610 --> 00:05:32.882
There's no wrong answer.

00:05:32.882 --> 00:05:36.000
Travis, can I call on you?

00:05:36.000 --> 00:05:36.590
Any thoughts?

00:05:36.590 --> 00:05:40.364
What skills would be
important for kids to learn?

00:05:40.364 --> 00:05:43.140
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]
creativity.

00:05:43.140 --> 00:05:45.710
SHAZIA MAKHDUMI: A
good answer, yeah.

00:05:45.710 --> 00:05:47.120
Creativity is important.

00:05:47.120 --> 00:05:49.790
Anyway, so you know, there
are-- so interestingly,

00:05:49.790 --> 00:05:52.590
one would think that, yes,
coding and engineering

00:05:52.590 --> 00:05:56.880
and all that, the sciences
and all are important--

00:05:56.880 --> 00:05:57.800
and they were there.

00:05:57.800 --> 00:05:59.650
But business leaders
overwhelmingly

00:05:59.650 --> 00:06:01.400
said the soft skills
are really important.

00:06:01.400 --> 00:06:04.470
So you know, problem solving,
team building, collaboration,

00:06:04.470 --> 00:06:07.430
communication, all
those really matter.

00:06:07.430 --> 00:06:09.140
And why?

00:06:09.140 --> 00:06:12.800
It's because even as technology
changes, types of works people

00:06:12.800 --> 00:06:15.590
do are different, and again,
those jobs, 60% of which

00:06:15.590 --> 00:06:17.570
haven't been invented yet.

00:06:17.570 --> 00:06:20.210
These skills are what you
need to basically crack

00:06:20.210 --> 00:06:21.440
hard challenges, right?

00:06:21.440 --> 00:06:23.880
Work with diverse
teams to solve problems

00:06:23.880 --> 00:06:27.480
or imagine problems
that don't exist.

00:06:27.480 --> 00:06:31.400
So as developers,
think about making sure

00:06:31.400 --> 00:06:32.850
that the apps and
games you build

00:06:32.850 --> 00:06:39.590
help instill these
skills in kids,

00:06:39.590 --> 00:06:42.950
more than just, it's a math
app, or this app helps them

00:06:42.950 --> 00:06:47.690
with this particular
part of their curriculum.

00:06:47.690 --> 00:06:50.360
So innovation-- so I'll give
you some examples of these,

00:06:50.360 --> 00:06:53.780
even at Google-- innovation
we know is global.

00:06:53.780 --> 00:06:56.090
And as we think about
innovation in the future,

00:06:56.090 --> 00:06:58.100
it's going to come from a lot of
different perspectives working

00:06:58.100 --> 00:06:58.790
together.

00:06:58.790 --> 00:07:00.980
In fact, we have human
to human collaboration,

00:07:00.980 --> 00:07:04.910
and there's a lot more human
to smart machine collaboration.

00:07:04.910 --> 00:07:07.070
So at Google, we
have a diverse team.

00:07:07.070 --> 00:07:09.530
And you can see
just being here, we

00:07:09.530 --> 00:07:11.540
have people different
countries and cultures

00:07:11.540 --> 00:07:13.640
and different languages
work together,

00:07:13.640 --> 00:07:16.800
but also collaborate
across disciplines.

00:07:16.800 --> 00:07:21.140
So for example, you
have the Google Lens,

00:07:21.140 --> 00:07:24.470
which is a contact lens,
which measures the blood sugar

00:07:24.470 --> 00:07:26.620
level in diabetic patients.

00:07:26.620 --> 00:07:28.620
And in this we have, of
course, data scientists,

00:07:28.620 --> 00:07:31.220
computer engineers, but
collaborating with biologists

00:07:31.220 --> 00:07:33.050
and urologists, right?

00:07:33.050 --> 00:07:37.520
So a more recent example is
the phenomenon of Pokemon GO.

00:07:37.520 --> 00:07:41.810
You've got IP licensors and
AR engineers and cartographers

00:07:41.810 --> 00:07:44.810
all coming together to create
this really interesting,

00:07:44.810 --> 00:07:46.920
different experience.

00:07:46.920 --> 00:07:49.310
So to do well, kids
will need to learn

00:07:49.310 --> 00:07:54.020
how to collaborate effectively
across all these boundaries.

00:07:54.020 --> 00:07:55.880
And creativity, as
Thomas mentioned also,

00:07:55.880 --> 00:07:58.580
is going to be really important,
because creativity actually

00:07:58.580 --> 00:08:01.310
drives true invention.

00:08:01.310 --> 00:08:03.500
So think about
artificial intelligence,

00:08:03.500 --> 00:08:06.890
for example, where you
have, in Google Photos,

00:08:06.890 --> 00:08:09.290
you can do a search for
pictures of your dog.

00:08:09.290 --> 00:08:11.300
And without having tagged
them, all the pictures

00:08:11.300 --> 00:08:12.890
in which your dog
is present show up

00:08:12.890 --> 00:08:14.420
because it understands the dog.

00:08:14.420 --> 00:08:18.410
Or the technology in
self-driving cars, right?

00:08:18.410 --> 00:08:21.050
Industrial machines took
over blue collar jobs,

00:08:21.050 --> 00:08:23.270
and we see computers
increasingly taking

00:08:23.270 --> 00:08:24.325
over white collar jobs.

00:08:24.325 --> 00:08:26.700
But there's something computers
won't ever be able to do,

00:08:26.700 --> 00:08:28.850
which is identify
what are the problems

00:08:28.850 --> 00:08:31.640
and what things need
to be created, and then

00:08:31.640 --> 00:08:34.250
drive to create them.

00:08:34.250 --> 00:08:37.789
And that is why helping kids,
instill creativity in kids,

00:08:37.789 --> 00:08:40.860
is so important.

00:08:40.860 --> 00:08:43.520
There's a lot of information,
right, at our fingertips.

00:08:43.520 --> 00:08:47.060
And in fact, years ago
kids went to the library

00:08:47.060 --> 00:08:50.426
and sifted through encyclopedias
and got that information.

00:08:50.426 --> 00:08:52.300
Now they have it on a
computer on their desk.

00:08:52.300 --> 00:08:54.020
Then they have it
on their phone.

00:08:54.020 --> 00:08:55.310
They have it on their wrist.

00:08:55.310 --> 00:08:58.010
And soon they're going
to be wearing things

00:08:58.010 --> 00:08:59.420
which give them information.

00:08:59.420 --> 00:09:01.850
So critical thinking is really
important to understand,

00:09:01.850 --> 00:09:05.030
with all the sea of information,
how do you sift through it,

00:09:05.030 --> 00:09:08.115
find out what's important,
and then actually use that.

00:09:10.830 --> 00:09:13.340
So moving on now a little
bit to kind of our learnings

00:09:13.340 --> 00:09:16.640
from having the families
actually on Play,

00:09:16.640 --> 00:09:19.050
and what it takes to
achieve success there.

00:09:19.050 --> 00:09:21.050
So we've done a lot of
research, as I mentioned,

00:09:21.050 --> 00:09:22.610
with parents and kids.

00:09:22.610 --> 00:09:26.420
And as you all know,
there's two main users

00:09:26.420 --> 00:09:29.600
of any kids' content, unlike
sort of other categories.

00:09:29.600 --> 00:09:32.210
So you've got the parents
who made the download

00:09:32.210 --> 00:09:35.730
decisions and control the
spend, definitely, and who

00:09:35.730 --> 00:09:36.980
also monitor the usage.

00:09:36.980 --> 00:09:39.530
And then you've got kids,
who are the ultimate users

00:09:39.530 --> 00:09:40.730
of that content.

00:09:40.730 --> 00:09:43.130
And we've seen this
distinct split.

00:09:43.130 --> 00:09:45.980
As kids grow older, the
parent's role changes.

00:09:45.980 --> 00:09:49.220
So when kids are young, up
to eight years old or so,

00:09:49.220 --> 00:09:53.000
parents really make the ultimate
decision on what to download.

00:09:53.000 --> 00:09:54.302
They have the final say.

00:09:54.302 --> 00:09:55.260
They make the decision.

00:09:55.260 --> 00:09:57.635
They, in fact, for younger
kids, they spend a lot of time

00:09:57.635 --> 00:09:59.930
with the kids, and you
know, playing with them

00:09:59.930 --> 00:10:00.800
with that content.

00:10:00.800 --> 00:10:03.050
But as kids grow older,
their interests change.

00:10:03.050 --> 00:10:06.664
And they get their own
hobbies, their own friends who

00:10:06.664 --> 00:10:08.330
will give them
recommendations, and they

00:10:08.330 --> 00:10:09.689
have their own devices.

00:10:09.689 --> 00:10:11.480
And that's where parent's
role changes more

00:10:11.480 --> 00:10:13.040
towards this sort
of monitoring role,

00:10:13.040 --> 00:10:14.873
and sometimes this is
where parents and kids

00:10:14.873 --> 00:10:17.180
butt heads on what's
appropriate to download.

00:10:17.180 --> 00:10:19.010
So therefore,
thinking about parents

00:10:19.010 --> 00:10:20.800
is equally, if not
more important,

00:10:20.800 --> 00:10:23.210
as thinking about kids.

00:10:23.210 --> 00:10:25.910
So on Play, we've
noticed parents actually

00:10:25.910 --> 00:10:28.550
browse a lot more
than the average user.

00:10:28.550 --> 00:10:30.092
Typically, people
come to Play Store,

00:10:30.092 --> 00:10:31.966
they know what they
want, they search for it,

00:10:31.966 --> 00:10:33.050
download and leave.

00:10:33.050 --> 00:10:35.210
But when parents do
that, they actually come

00:10:35.210 --> 00:10:38.270
and they spend time
browsing, looking for stuff

00:10:38.270 --> 00:10:41.630
that they think their kid is
going to be interested in.

00:10:41.630 --> 00:10:44.660
They spend a lot of time doing
categorical, sort of searches,

00:10:44.660 --> 00:10:46.310
and going through
different categories.

00:10:46.310 --> 00:10:49.310
And also comparing apps
and evaluating them to say,

00:10:49.310 --> 00:10:53.270
is this appropriate
for my child.

00:10:53.270 --> 00:10:55.939
And when they search and
browse, what do they look at?

00:10:55.939 --> 00:10:57.980
There are three main things
that they've told us.

00:10:57.980 --> 00:11:01.210
They care about brands because
brands to them denote quality,

00:11:01.210 --> 00:11:04.242
and it's appropriate, it's kid
friendly, and especially brands

00:11:04.242 --> 00:11:05.450
that they've known and loved.

00:11:05.450 --> 00:11:07.760
And so investing in a
brand, while expensive,

00:11:07.760 --> 00:11:10.100
definitely makes
sense in the space.

00:11:10.100 --> 00:11:12.790
They also think about interest,
their child's interest.

00:11:12.790 --> 00:11:15.620
A child likes dinosaurs
or planes or travel.

00:11:15.620 --> 00:11:17.350
And also sometimes
formal learning,

00:11:17.350 --> 00:11:19.100
you know, the math, animals.

00:11:19.100 --> 00:11:22.910
And then finally, they
care about characters.

00:11:22.910 --> 00:11:25.610
And they care about
characters that

00:11:25.610 --> 00:11:27.860
are-- kids are
watching their TV shows

00:11:27.860 --> 00:11:29.180
and [INAUDIBLE] interested in.

00:11:29.180 --> 00:11:31.940
But also even sometimes
characters from their childhood

00:11:31.940 --> 00:11:35.480
that they want to
bring to their kids.

00:11:35.480 --> 00:11:38.495
And what are the top
factors that parents then

00:11:38.495 --> 00:11:40.750
use to make their
decision to purchase?

00:11:40.750 --> 00:11:45.590
So the million dollar, or rather
the $2.99 question, rather.

00:11:45.590 --> 00:11:48.986
So they've told us these six
things matter a lot to them.

00:11:48.986 --> 00:11:50.610
Fun and engagement
is important, right?

00:11:50.610 --> 00:11:51.664
And that makes sense.

00:11:51.664 --> 00:11:53.330
But this also, there's
a nuance to this.

00:11:53.330 --> 00:11:56.180
Because this changes as
the kid's age changes.

00:11:56.180 --> 00:11:58.280
When kids are younger,
parents are looking more

00:11:58.280 --> 00:11:59.930
for something
educational and fun.

00:11:59.930 --> 00:12:02.310
But as kids grow older and
they start going to school,

00:12:02.310 --> 00:12:03.380
parents recognize
they're getting

00:12:03.380 --> 00:12:04.640
a lot of learning from there.

00:12:04.640 --> 00:12:07.400
So then it becomes more
entertaining and recreational.

00:12:07.400 --> 00:12:09.980
So it really needs to be a
way for them to relax and not

00:12:09.980 --> 00:12:12.350
kind of to get stressed out.

00:12:12.350 --> 00:12:15.680
They also care about it
being age appropriate, right?

00:12:15.680 --> 00:12:17.810
So this is not just
the content, you know,

00:12:17.810 --> 00:12:20.000
doesn't have profanity or
sexual content and all,

00:12:20.000 --> 00:12:21.990
but is my kid going
to be frustrated

00:12:21.990 --> 00:12:25.490
because the activities are
too easy or too hard for them.

00:12:25.490 --> 00:12:27.711
So really look for that.

00:12:27.711 --> 00:12:29.960
They care about interest,
and we've talked about that.

00:12:29.960 --> 00:12:31.751
And this is where
sometimes for older kids,

00:12:31.751 --> 00:12:34.400
their interests and their
parent's interests diverge.

00:12:34.400 --> 00:12:36.140
And educational
content, and this

00:12:36.140 --> 00:12:37.640
matters a lot when
they are younger.

00:12:37.640 --> 00:12:39.014
Because for younger
kids, parents

00:12:39.014 --> 00:12:42.740
associate any sort of content
with being educational.

00:12:42.740 --> 00:12:44.900
High quality really
matters to them.

00:12:44.900 --> 00:12:47.210
Like it needs to be something
that looks professional,

00:12:47.210 --> 00:12:48.830
it's been done nicely.

00:12:48.830 --> 00:12:51.470
And then, of course, price.

00:12:51.470 --> 00:12:54.830
So how, where do
they look to know--

00:12:54.830 --> 00:12:56.780
I mean, that's a lot
of huge laundry list--

00:12:56.780 --> 00:12:59.960
how do they know that
something has this or not?

00:12:59.960 --> 00:13:00.984
The app listing page.

00:13:00.984 --> 00:13:02.900
And that is why it's
really, really important,

00:13:02.900 --> 00:13:05.630
and as you've probably heard,
a lot of the stuff we're doing,

00:13:05.630 --> 00:13:07.800
all the tools Google
Play is building,

00:13:07.800 --> 00:13:09.770
are geared towards
really helping

00:13:09.770 --> 00:13:11.730
you guys optimize that page.

00:13:11.730 --> 00:13:12.230
Right?

00:13:12.230 --> 00:13:14.900
So here, star rating matters.

00:13:14.900 --> 00:13:18.050
And star rating, four stars
or above is really good.

00:13:18.050 --> 00:13:20.580
And what parents say they
do is when they even,

00:13:20.580 --> 00:13:23.180
in search results, they use
the star rating as a way

00:13:23.180 --> 00:13:25.859
to then click into and
get into a listing page,

00:13:25.859 --> 00:13:28.400
because they're like, wow, this
seems like it's high quality.

00:13:28.400 --> 00:13:30.890
And we've seen
before also, quality

00:13:30.890 --> 00:13:32.540
corresponds commensurately.

00:13:32.540 --> 00:13:34.580
The higher the star
rating, and also

00:13:34.580 --> 00:13:38.270
corresponds to higher revenue.

00:13:38.270 --> 00:13:42.800
Parents also use the family
badge with the age rating.

00:13:42.800 --> 00:13:45.740
And that, they've told us, is
a really quick and easy way

00:13:45.740 --> 00:13:49.790
for them to scan to see, is this
trusted and appropriate, right,

00:13:49.790 --> 00:13:52.700
and kid friendly, and also is
it appropriate, age appropriate,

00:13:52.700 --> 00:13:53.624
for their kids.

00:13:53.624 --> 00:13:55.040
So that badge is
really important.

00:13:55.040 --> 00:13:57.900
So as you think about what
age group you want to,

00:13:57.900 --> 00:14:00.770
you want to put
down for your app,

00:14:00.770 --> 00:14:02.600
really think
carefully through what

00:14:02.600 --> 00:14:06.280
is that, what that
is, because parents

00:14:06.280 --> 00:14:07.820
will use that to
determine whether

00:14:07.820 --> 00:14:10.660
or not to download your content.

00:14:10.660 --> 00:14:12.140
Title and description matter.

00:14:12.140 --> 00:14:14.300
In fact, parents have
told us they actually

00:14:14.300 --> 00:14:17.720
read the description
fully, and probably more

00:14:17.720 --> 00:14:18.720
than any other category.

00:14:18.720 --> 00:14:20.719
So make sure you are very
thoughtful when you're

00:14:20.719 --> 00:14:21.860
writing that description.

00:14:21.860 --> 00:14:24.050
And I've said before
in other presentations,

00:14:24.050 --> 00:14:26.870
you know, if you want accolades,
and all that's important,

00:14:26.870 --> 00:14:30.240
but really be very clear upfront
initially, this is what it is,

00:14:30.240 --> 00:14:30.740
right?

00:14:30.740 --> 00:14:33.590
And then you can go through all
the different prices and all

00:14:33.590 --> 00:14:34.760
[INAUDIBLE].

00:14:34.760 --> 00:14:38.180
And finally, icon and
screenshots are very important.

00:14:38.180 --> 00:14:40.580
Kids especially react,
and we've done surveys,

00:14:40.580 --> 00:14:41.570
they react to the icon.

00:14:41.570 --> 00:14:43.611
That's one of the most
important things for them.

00:14:43.611 --> 00:14:46.044
And parents use screenshots
to understand what

00:14:46.044 --> 00:14:47.210
the user experience will be.

00:14:47.210 --> 00:14:48.950
Remember, they're not
the ultimate user.

00:14:48.950 --> 00:14:51.200
And especially for something
that they're not sure of,

00:14:51.200 --> 00:14:53.210
the screenshot tells
them very quickly,

00:14:53.210 --> 00:14:55.310
yes, this is something
that my kids would like.

00:14:58.100 --> 00:15:00.860
Ratings and reviews, you've
heard a lot about how important

00:15:00.860 --> 00:15:03.650
they are in having a,
sort of, in improving

00:15:03.650 --> 00:15:06.020
your quality of the app.

00:15:06.020 --> 00:15:07.865
And it reflects--
sorry-- it reflects

00:15:07.865 --> 00:15:11.330
in the quality of the app way
more important in this space,

00:15:11.330 --> 00:15:12.830
family space, than any other.

00:15:12.830 --> 00:15:16.490
Because parents use these
reviews to understand,

00:15:16.490 --> 00:15:18.770
is that content appropriate,
have other parents

00:15:18.770 --> 00:15:20.120
liked this content.

00:15:20.120 --> 00:15:21.650
And it gives them
a sense of whether

00:15:21.650 --> 00:15:22.670
or not their kid will like it.

00:15:22.670 --> 00:15:25.295
Remember, because they're making
a decision not for themselves,

00:15:25.295 --> 00:15:26.850
but for someone else.

00:15:26.850 --> 00:15:30.807
So the first, typically the
first ten reviews or so matter.

00:15:30.807 --> 00:15:32.390
And it also matters,
are those reviews

00:15:32.390 --> 00:15:33.649
from other parents, right?

00:15:33.649 --> 00:15:35.690
Because even if it's
friends who don't have kids,

00:15:35.690 --> 00:15:37.731
it's not as important as
someone they don't know,

00:15:37.731 --> 00:15:40.160
but who has a kid
their kid's age.

00:15:40.160 --> 00:15:43.010
So they really look for
reviews from other parents.

00:15:43.010 --> 00:15:44.870
And I'd encourage
you guys to make sure

00:15:44.870 --> 00:15:48.410
that your users who love your
apps leave reviews up there.

00:15:48.410 --> 00:15:50.960
And take advantage of
Play's features and reviews

00:15:50.960 --> 00:15:55.140
that you've heard about
earlier today, and also at I/O.

00:15:55.140 --> 00:15:57.340
So we talked about how
compelling store listing is,

00:15:57.340 --> 00:15:58.380
and the icon.

00:15:58.380 --> 00:16:01.050
How many people here have used
store listing experiments,

00:16:01.050 --> 00:16:02.940
by the way?

00:16:02.940 --> 00:16:05.770
How many haven't, but plan to?

00:16:05.770 --> 00:16:06.640
OK.

00:16:06.640 --> 00:16:08.670
Well, these are
really important.

00:16:08.670 --> 00:16:10.170
You've heard me
talk about, probably

00:16:10.170 --> 00:16:12.600
if you've come to one of
my presentations, Rovio,

00:16:12.600 --> 00:16:15.160
who now does not launch
anything without experimenting

00:16:15.160 --> 00:16:17.160
with the icon to see what works.

00:16:17.160 --> 00:16:20.330
And then BabyFirst, who
used-- changed an icon

00:16:20.330 --> 00:16:22.475
and saw a 10% increase
in installs in their app.

00:16:22.475 --> 00:16:23.850
And some of you
earlier this year

00:16:23.850 --> 00:16:26.910
may have heard Per
from Apps Families,

00:16:26.910 --> 00:16:28.440
talk about Superpuzzle.

00:16:28.440 --> 00:16:32.232
They noticed when they launched
with the dragon icon wasn't

00:16:32.232 --> 00:16:34.440
getting a lot of downloads
and they weren't sure why.

00:16:34.440 --> 00:16:37.740
They changed to the unicorn
and almost immediately

00:16:37.740 --> 00:16:40.144
revenue and downloads doubled.

00:16:40.144 --> 00:16:41.810
And they figured out,
it's because there

00:16:41.810 --> 00:16:43.656
are a lot of moms who
are downloading this.

00:16:43.656 --> 00:16:45.030
And for some
reason, I think they

00:16:45.030 --> 00:16:49.260
saw women get, like the
icon, like unicorns.

00:16:49.260 --> 00:16:52.290
And so then after
that, they experimented

00:16:52.290 --> 00:16:54.630
with using a borderless
icon, and they saw installs

00:16:54.630 --> 00:16:57.150
increase up to 5% after that.

00:16:57.150 --> 00:16:59.250
So if you're not
using this already,

00:16:59.250 --> 00:17:01.690
I would definitely
think about this.

00:17:01.690 --> 00:17:03.750
But the point I'm also
trying to make here

00:17:03.750 --> 00:17:06.280
is, think about your audience
and what they want, right.

00:17:06.280 --> 00:17:07.863
They're thinking
moms are downloading,

00:17:07.863 --> 00:17:09.060
unicorns matter to them.

00:17:09.060 --> 00:17:10.260
And then test it.

00:17:10.260 --> 00:17:12.350
So this is where it's
both an art and a science.

00:17:15.180 --> 00:17:20.119
So a high quality experience
needs to work on any device

00:17:20.119 --> 00:17:21.569
that it's used on.

00:17:21.569 --> 00:17:24.210
And in the kids
space, tablets are

00:17:24.210 --> 00:17:26.447
way more important than in
maybe any other category.

00:17:26.447 --> 00:17:28.780
And in fact, I would say
equally, if not more important,

00:17:28.780 --> 00:17:29.940
than phones.

00:17:29.940 --> 00:17:32.320
So younger kids especially
are avid tablet users.

00:17:32.320 --> 00:17:34.080
Sometimes it's a cheaper device.

00:17:34.080 --> 00:17:35.790
It's a hand-me-down
from their parents.

00:17:35.790 --> 00:17:37.800
It's a family device,
unlike the phone, which

00:17:37.800 --> 00:17:39.540
is a very personal device.

00:17:39.540 --> 00:17:41.760
And given that, a lot of
spend are family apps.

00:17:41.760 --> 00:17:44.130
A majority of it
comes on tablets.

00:17:44.130 --> 00:17:46.650
Optimizing for tablets and
using our tablet guidelines

00:17:46.650 --> 00:17:50.620
to make sure that you
use the full real estate

00:17:50.620 --> 00:17:53.220
in your screenshots,
and using as much

00:17:53.220 --> 00:17:57.690
as you can to make sure it
works on tablets is important.

00:17:57.690 --> 00:18:00.750
And then speaking of
testing, right, you

00:18:00.750 --> 00:18:03.600
want to make sure that it works
on whatever device, as I said.

00:18:03.600 --> 00:18:06.150
Whether the parent or the
child making the decision,

00:18:06.150 --> 00:18:08.384
it needs to, you don't
want them to leave--

00:18:08.384 --> 00:18:10.050
you've got this
beautiful content that's

00:18:10.050 --> 00:18:12.150
teaching kids creativity
and collaboration--

00:18:12.150 --> 00:18:13.890
but if it's buggy,
kids are fickle.

00:18:13.890 --> 00:18:15.210
They're going to leave.

00:18:15.210 --> 00:18:18.060
So use-- and I know we've
talked about this earlier--

00:18:18.060 --> 00:18:23.070
but use the Firebase Test
Lab pre-launch report to see,

00:18:23.070 --> 00:18:25.280
does it work on all the
devices it's supposed to.

00:18:25.280 --> 00:18:28.290
Are the screenshots showing
up correctly where they are?

00:18:28.290 --> 00:18:29.934
Are there any bugs
or vulnerabilities?

00:18:32.610 --> 00:18:34.200
But I want-- you
know, I've done a lot

00:18:34.200 --> 00:18:36.060
of talking-- I want
to also for you

00:18:36.060 --> 00:18:38.670
to hear from developers
on what Play for Families

00:18:38.670 --> 00:18:39.680
has meant for them.

00:18:39.680 --> 00:18:40.950
Can we play the video, please?

00:18:40.950 --> 00:18:41.616
[VIDEO PLAYBACK]

00:18:41.616 --> 00:18:43.700
- The launch of the Family
section on Google Play

00:18:43.700 --> 00:18:46.790
was hugely positive
for StoryToys.

00:18:46.790 --> 00:18:49.110
I think what it did
was solve the discovery

00:18:49.110 --> 00:18:51.330
issue for parents.

00:18:51.330 --> 00:18:55.110
It's really provided a safe,
trusted, creative space

00:18:55.110 --> 00:18:58.830
for families to
find new content.

00:18:58.830 --> 00:19:01.260
- My partner, Guy Oranim,
and I started BabyFirst

00:19:01.260 --> 00:19:04.740
with the idea and the passion to
create good educational content

00:19:04.740 --> 00:19:07.620
for babies, toddlers
and their parents.

00:19:07.620 --> 00:19:10.050
When we learned about
the Family category

00:19:10.050 --> 00:19:13.320
on the Google Play
Store, it was 100% match

00:19:13.320 --> 00:19:14.700
to the BabyFirst values.

00:19:14.700 --> 00:19:16.530
We have seen that
parents can easily

00:19:16.530 --> 00:19:19.290
find the content
they are looking for.

00:19:19.290 --> 00:19:22.860
We now have 40% more
downloads on Google Play

00:19:22.860 --> 00:19:24.390
than we do on other platforms.

00:19:24.390 --> 00:19:26.490
We like that.

00:19:26.490 --> 00:19:29.010
- Since the launch of the
Family section on Google Play,

00:19:29.010 --> 00:19:32.070
our experience with Android has
been completely transformed.

00:19:32.070 --> 00:19:34.740
We saw a huge uplift in
revenues, and of downloads,

00:19:34.740 --> 00:19:35.550
too.

00:19:35.550 --> 00:19:37.680
Google Play was now
our number one channel.

00:19:37.680 --> 00:19:38.750
It's been nothing but
positive, and we're

00:19:38.750 --> 00:19:39.791
delighted to be involved.

00:19:50.852 --> 00:19:54.777
[END PLAYBACK]

00:19:54.777 --> 00:19:56.860
SHAZIA MAKHDUMI: That's
what I want to close with.

00:19:56.860 --> 00:20:00.300
So if you are-- we talked about
a Designed for Family Program

00:20:00.300 --> 00:20:03.660
earlier-- so if you are
building any content for kids,

00:20:03.660 --> 00:20:05.250
either if it's purely
for kids, i.e.,

00:20:05.250 --> 00:20:07.440
child directed, or it's
for a mixed audience,

00:20:07.440 --> 00:20:10.200
so adults and kids
both enjoy it,

00:20:10.200 --> 00:20:13.320
make sure you join the
Designed for Families Program,

00:20:13.320 --> 00:20:14.830
understanding the guidelines.

00:20:14.830 --> 00:20:19.800
So you need to have a rating
of 10 or 10 from ESRB.

00:20:19.800 --> 00:20:21.630
And also think
about the audience,

00:20:21.630 --> 00:20:24.030
where if it's a purely
child directed app,

00:20:24.030 --> 00:20:25.890
you can't use
Google Play sign in.

00:20:25.890 --> 00:20:28.720
And if it's for both kids
and adults, you can use it

00:20:28.720 --> 00:20:29.730
but make it optional.

00:20:29.730 --> 00:20:31.355
For the rest of you,
if you're thinking

00:20:31.355 --> 00:20:34.260
about creating
content, both for kids

00:20:34.260 --> 00:20:35.940
and publishing on
the Play Store,

00:20:35.940 --> 00:20:37.290
definitely download that.

00:20:37.290 --> 00:20:39.040
Our marketing team has
done an amazing job

00:20:39.040 --> 00:20:43.321
in getting, not just insights
that we've learned on Play,

00:20:43.321 --> 00:20:45.570
but also insights from other
developers, some of which

00:20:45.570 --> 00:20:49.840
you heard in the video, on
best practices that they use.

00:20:49.840 --> 00:20:50.340
Cool.

00:20:50.340 --> 00:20:50.970
Thank you so much.

00:20:50.970 --> 00:20:53.690
And I'll be around later if you
want to ask any more questions.

00:20:53.690 --> 00:20:54.950
Hope that was helpful.

00:20:54.950 --> 00:20:56.394
