00:00:00.570 --> 00:00:04.100
We now have the general
tools to really tackle any

00:00:04.100 --> 00:00:05.390
multiplication problems.

00:00:05.390 --> 00:00:08.390
So in this video I'm just going
to do a ton of examples.

00:00:08.390 --> 00:00:12.670
So let's start off with--
and I'll start in yellow.

00:00:12.670 --> 00:00:17.075
Let's start off
with 32 times 18.

00:00:20.320 --> 00:00:24.260
Say 8 times 2 is 16.

00:00:24.260 --> 00:00:26.670
Well, I'll do it in our head
this time because you always

00:00:26.670 --> 00:00:28.510
don't have all this
space to work with.

00:00:28.510 --> 00:00:33.690
So 8 times 2 is 16.

00:00:33.690 --> 00:00:34.810
Put the 1 up there.

00:00:34.810 --> 00:00:37.500
8 times 3 is 24.

00:00:37.500 --> 00:00:39.750
24 plus 1 is 25.

00:00:42.540 --> 00:00:46.300
So 8 times 32 was 256.

00:00:46.300 --> 00:00:48.430
Now we're going to have to
multiply this 1, which is

00:00:48.430 --> 00:00:51.230
really a 10, times 32.

00:00:51.230 --> 00:00:53.220
I'll underline it
with the orange.

00:00:53.220 --> 00:00:56.430
1 times 2-- oh, we have
to be very careful here.

00:00:56.430 --> 00:00:58.770
1 times 2 is 2.

00:00:58.770 --> 00:01:01.080
So you might say hey, let
me stick a 2 down there.

00:01:01.080 --> 00:01:02.640
Remember, this isn't a 1.

00:01:02.640 --> 00:01:05.470
This is a 10, so we have
to stick a 0 there

00:01:05.470 --> 00:01:06.620
to remember that.

00:01:06.620 --> 00:01:10.860
So 10 times 2 is 20.

00:01:10.860 --> 00:01:13.520
Or you say 1 times 2 is 2, but
you're putting it in the 2's

00:01:13.520 --> 00:01:15.020
place, so you still get 20.

00:01:15.020 --> 00:01:16.320
So 10 times 2 is 20.

00:01:16.320 --> 00:01:17.660
It works out.

00:01:17.660 --> 00:01:19.510
Then 1 times 3.

00:01:19.510 --> 00:01:20.750
And we have to be very careful.

00:01:20.750 --> 00:01:22.780
Let's get rid of what
we had from before.

00:01:22.780 --> 00:01:25.600
1 times 3 is 3.

00:01:25.600 --> 00:01:29.390
There's nothing to add
here, so you just get a 3.

00:01:29.390 --> 00:01:34.530
And so you get 10
times 32 is 320.

00:01:34.530 --> 00:01:36.200
This 1 right here, that's a 10.

00:01:36.200 --> 00:01:38.830
10 plus 8 is 18.

00:01:38.830 --> 00:01:41.410
So now we just add
up the two numbers.

00:01:41.410 --> 00:01:42.510
You add them up.

00:01:42.510 --> 00:01:44.410
6 plus 0 is 6.

00:01:44.410 --> 00:01:46.180
5 plus 2 is 7.

00:01:46.180 --> 00:01:49.240
2 plus 3 is 5.

00:01:49.240 --> 00:01:50.850
Let's keep going.

00:01:50.850 --> 00:01:56.830
Let's do 99 times 88.

00:01:56.830 --> 00:01:58.450
So a big number.

00:01:58.450 --> 00:02:03.060
8 times 9 is 72.

00:02:03.060 --> 00:02:06.690
Stick the 7 up there.

00:02:06.690 --> 00:02:08.440
And then you have
8 times 9 again.

00:02:08.440 --> 00:02:11.350
8 times 9 is 72, but now
you have the 7 up here.

00:02:11.350 --> 00:02:16.280
So 72 plus 7 is 79.

00:02:16.280 --> 00:02:17.080
Fair enough.

00:02:17.080 --> 00:02:18.250
Now we're done with this.

00:02:18.250 --> 00:02:20.315
Let's just delete it just so
that we don't get confused

00:02:20.315 --> 00:02:22.160
in our next step.

00:02:22.160 --> 00:02:25.240
In our next we're going to
multiply this 8 now times 99.

00:02:25.240 --> 00:02:26.800
But this 8 is an 80.

00:02:26.800 --> 00:02:28.420
So let's stick a 0 down there.

00:02:28.420 --> 00:02:31.010
8 times 9 is 72.

00:02:31.010 --> 00:02:32.660
Stick a 7 up there.

00:02:32.660 --> 00:02:34.590
Then 8 times 9 is 72.

00:02:34.590 --> 00:02:35.630
Plus 7 is 79.

00:02:38.180 --> 00:02:40.330
2 plus 0 is 2.

00:02:40.330 --> 00:02:42.470
Let me switch colors.

00:02:42.470 --> 00:02:44.560
9 plus 2 is 11.

00:02:44.560 --> 00:02:45.820
Carry the 1.

00:02:45.820 --> 00:02:47.890
1 plus 7 is 8.

00:02:47.890 --> 00:02:50.150
8 plus 9 is 17.

00:02:50.150 --> 00:02:51.100
Carry the 1.

00:02:51.100 --> 00:02:53.530
1 plus 7 is 8.

00:02:53.530 --> 00:02:56.390
8,712.

00:02:56.390 --> 00:02:58.960
Let's keep going.

00:02:58.960 --> 00:03:01.120
Can't do enough of these.

00:03:01.120 --> 00:03:06.430
All right, 53 times 78.

00:03:09.380 --> 00:03:11.160
I think you're getting
the hang of it now.

00:03:11.160 --> 00:03:13.410
Let's multiply 8
times 53 first.

00:03:13.410 --> 00:03:17.330
So 8 times 3 is 24.

00:03:17.330 --> 00:03:18.890
Stick the 2 up there.

00:03:18.890 --> 00:03:21.980
8 times 5 is 40.

00:03:21.980 --> 00:03:23.610
40 plus 2 is 42.

00:03:26.920 --> 00:03:30.370
Now we're going to have to
deal with that 7 right

00:03:30.370 --> 00:03:31.980
there, which is really a 70.

00:03:31.980 --> 00:03:34.310
So we got to remember
to put the 0 there.

00:03:34.310 --> 00:03:37.200
7 times 3, and let's
get rid of this.

00:03:37.200 --> 00:03:38.450
Don't want to get confused.

00:03:38.450 --> 00:03:41.050
7 times 3 is 21.

00:03:41.050 --> 00:03:43.470
Put the 1 there and
put the 2 up here.

00:03:43.470 --> 00:03:46.840
7 times 5 is 35.

00:03:46.840 --> 00:03:50.280
Plus 2 is 37.

00:03:50.280 --> 00:03:52.450
Now we're ready to add.

00:03:52.450 --> 00:03:54.960
4 plus 0 is 4.

00:03:54.960 --> 00:03:56.940
2 plus 1 is 3.

00:03:56.940 --> 00:04:00.220
4 plus 7 is 11.

00:04:00.220 --> 00:04:00.960
Carry the 1.

00:04:00.960 --> 00:04:03.150
1 plus 3 is 4.

00:04:03.150 --> 00:04:06.980
4,134.

00:04:06.980 --> 00:04:08.510
Let's up the stakes
a little bit.

00:04:12.130 --> 00:04:27.240
So let's say I had
796 times 58.

00:04:27.240 --> 00:04:28.850
Let's mix it up well.

00:04:28.850 --> 00:04:33.090
All right, so first we're just
going to multiply 8 times 796.

00:04:33.090 --> 00:04:35.410
And notice, I've thrown in
an extra digit up here.

00:04:35.410 --> 00:04:39.876
So 8 times 6 is 48.

00:04:39.876 --> 00:04:41.950
Put the 4 up there.

00:04:41.950 --> 00:04:45.460
8 times 9 is 72.

00:04:45.460 --> 00:04:47.240
Plus 4 is 76.

00:04:50.760 --> 00:04:54.620
And then 8 times 7 is 56.

00:04:54.620 --> 00:04:58.310
56 plus 7 is 63.

00:05:01.450 --> 00:05:03.290
I'm sure I'll make a
careless mistake at some

00:05:03.290 --> 00:05:04.080
point in this video.

00:05:04.080 --> 00:05:07.570
And the goal for you is to
identify if and when I do.

00:05:07.570 --> 00:05:09.410
All right, now we're ready,
so we can get rid of

00:05:09.410 --> 00:05:10.480
these guys up here.

00:05:10.480 --> 00:05:14.440
Now we can multiply this 5,
which is in the 10's place.

00:05:14.440 --> 00:05:15.730
It's really a 50.

00:05:15.730 --> 00:05:16.780
Times this up here.

00:05:16.780 --> 00:05:20.170
Because it's a 50 we
stick a 0 down there.

00:05:20.170 --> 00:05:24.230
5 times 6 is 30.

00:05:24.230 --> 00:05:26.990
Put the 0 there, put
the 3 up there.

00:05:26.990 --> 00:05:29.860
5 times 9 is 45.

00:05:29.860 --> 00:05:31.430
Plus the 3 is 48.

00:05:34.310 --> 00:05:36.950
5 times 7 is 35.

00:05:36.950 --> 00:05:38.020
Plus 4 is 39.

00:05:40.800 --> 00:05:43.420
Now we're ready to add.

00:05:43.420 --> 00:05:45.630
8 plus 0 is 8.

00:05:45.630 --> 00:05:49.110
6 plus 0 is 6.

00:05:49.110 --> 00:05:52.650
3 plus 8 is 11.

00:05:52.650 --> 00:05:54.070
1 plus 6 is 7.

00:05:54.070 --> 00:05:57.120
7 plus 9 is 16.

00:05:57.120 --> 00:05:59.480
And then 1 plus 3 is 4.

00:05:59.480 --> 00:06:05.190
So 796 times 58 is 46,168.

00:06:05.190 --> 00:06:10.220
And that sounds about right
because 796-- it's almost 800.

00:06:10.220 --> 00:06:12.190
You know, which
is almost 1,000.

00:06:12.190 --> 00:06:16.480
So if we multiplied 1,000
times 58 we'd get 58,000.

00:06:16.480 --> 00:06:19.160
But we're multiplying something
a little bit smaller than 1,000

00:06:19.160 --> 00:06:20.740
times 58, so we're getting
something a little bit

00:06:20.740 --> 00:06:22.160
smaller than 58,000.

00:06:22.160 --> 00:06:26.800
So the number is in
the correct ballpark.

00:06:26.800 --> 00:06:30.810
Now let's do one more here
where I'm really going

00:06:30.810 --> 00:06:33.310
to step up the stakes.

00:06:33.310 --> 00:06:41.520
Let's do 523 times-- I'm going
to do a three-digit number now.

00:06:41.520 --> 00:06:45.180
Times 798.

00:06:45.180 --> 00:06:47.940
That's a big
three-digit number.

00:06:47.940 --> 00:06:50.590
But it's the same
exact process.

00:06:50.590 --> 00:06:53.190
And once you kind of see the
pattern you say, hey, this'll

00:06:53.190 --> 00:06:55.920
apply to any number of digits
times any number of digits.

00:06:55.920 --> 00:06:59.040
It'll just start taking you a
long time and your chances of

00:06:59.040 --> 00:07:00.820
making a careless mistake are
going to go up, but

00:07:00.820 --> 00:07:02.570
it's the same idea.

00:07:02.570 --> 00:07:06.070
So we start with 8 times 523.

00:07:06.070 --> 00:07:09.740
8 times 3 is 24.

00:07:09.740 --> 00:07:13.060
Stick the 2 up there.

00:07:13.060 --> 00:07:16.340
Now 8 times 2 is 16.

00:07:16.340 --> 00:07:18.846
16 plus 2 is 18.

00:07:18.846 --> 00:07:20.580
Put the 1 up there.

00:07:20.580 --> 00:07:22.390
8 times 5 is 40.

00:07:22.390 --> 00:07:24.550
Plus 1 is 41.

00:07:24.550 --> 00:07:29.240
So 8 times 523 is 4,184.

00:07:29.240 --> 00:07:30.050
We're not done.

00:07:30.050 --> 00:07:34.260
We have to multiply times
the 90 and by the 700.

00:07:34.260 --> 00:07:37.190
So let's do the 90 right there.

00:07:37.190 --> 00:07:39.240
So it's a 90, so we'll
stick a 0 there.

00:07:39.240 --> 00:07:40.850
It's not a 9.

00:07:40.850 --> 00:07:43.080
And let's get rid of
these guys right there.

00:07:43.080 --> 00:07:45.000
9 times 3 is 27.

00:07:49.870 --> 00:07:54.000
9 times 2 is 18.

00:07:54.000 --> 00:07:56.285
18 plus 2 is 20.

00:07:58.960 --> 00:08:03.910
And then we have
9 times 5 is 45.

00:08:03.910 --> 00:08:09.625
45 plus 2 is 47.

00:08:09.625 --> 00:08:12.460
I don't want to
write that thick.

00:08:12.460 --> 00:08:13.580
47.

00:08:13.580 --> 00:08:15.500
Let me make sure I did that
one right, and let's just

00:08:15.500 --> 00:08:16.460
review it a little bit.

00:08:16.460 --> 00:08:19.540
9 times 3 was 27.

00:08:19.540 --> 00:08:22.180
We wrote the 7 down here
and put the 2 up there.

00:08:22.180 --> 00:08:24.490
9 times 2 is 18.

00:08:24.490 --> 00:08:27.110
We added 2 to that,
so we wrote 20.

00:08:27.110 --> 00:08:29.320
Wrote the 0 down there
and the 2 up there.

00:08:29.320 --> 00:08:31.620
The 9 times 5 was 45.

00:08:31.620 --> 00:08:33.630
Plus 2 is 47.

00:08:33.630 --> 00:08:35.400
You really have to make sure
you don't make careless

00:08:35.400 --> 00:08:37.360
mistakes with these.

00:08:37.360 --> 00:08:39.380
Then finally, we have to
multiply the 7, which is

00:08:39.380 --> 00:08:43.780
really a 700 times 523.

00:08:43.780 --> 00:08:46.090
When it was just an 8 we just
started multiplying here.

00:08:46.090 --> 00:08:48.190
When it was a 90, when we
were dealing with the 10's

00:08:48.190 --> 00:08:49.720
place, we put a 0 there.

00:08:49.720 --> 00:08:51.100
Now that we're dealing with
something that's in the

00:08:51.100 --> 00:08:53.630
100's, we're going to
put two 0's there.

00:08:56.770 --> 00:08:59.000
And so you have 7-- and let's
get rid of this stuff.

00:08:59.000 --> 00:09:00.610
That'll just mess us up.

00:09:00.610 --> 00:09:04.470
7 times 3 is 21.

00:09:04.470 --> 00:09:06.430
Put the 1 there.

00:09:06.430 --> 00:09:08.470
Stick the 2 up there.

00:09:08.470 --> 00:09:11.070
7 times 2 is 14.

00:09:11.070 --> 00:09:16.130
14 plus our 2 is 16.

00:09:16.130 --> 00:09:17.640
Put the 1 up there.

00:09:17.640 --> 00:09:20.410
7 times 5 is 35.

00:09:20.410 --> 00:09:21.690
Plus 1 is 36.

00:09:24.530 --> 00:09:26.820
And now we're ready to add.

00:09:26.820 --> 00:09:29.440
And hopefully we didn't make
any careless mistakes.

00:09:29.440 --> 00:09:30.940
So 4 plus 0 plus 0.

00:09:30.940 --> 00:09:31.550
That's easy.

00:09:31.550 --> 00:09:32.480
That's 4.

00:09:32.480 --> 00:09:34.100
8 plus 7 plus 0.

00:09:34.100 --> 00:09:36.030
That's 15.

00:09:36.030 --> 00:09:36.760
Carry the 1.

00:09:36.760 --> 00:09:39.530
1 plus 1 plus 1 is 3.

00:09:39.530 --> 00:09:41.560
4 plus 7 plus 6.

00:09:41.560 --> 00:09:42.080
That's what's?

00:09:42.080 --> 00:09:43.030
4 plus 6 is 10.

00:09:43.030 --> 00:09:43.950
It's 17.

00:09:46.580 --> 00:09:48.920
And then we have 1 plus 4 is 5.

00:09:48.920 --> 00:09:51.210
5 plus 6 is 11.

00:09:51.210 --> 00:09:52.230
Carry the 1.

00:09:52.230 --> 00:09:54.350
1 plus 3 is 4.

00:09:54.350 --> 00:10:03.570
So 523 times 798 is 417,354.

00:10:03.570 --> 00:10:05.730
Now we can even
check to make sure.

00:10:05.730 --> 00:10:07.240
And so this is the
moment of truth.

00:10:07.240 --> 00:10:08.620
Let's see if we
have-- let's see.

00:10:08.620 --> 00:10:15.560
523 times 798.

00:10:15.560 --> 00:10:16.430
There you go.

00:10:16.430 --> 00:10:17.150
Moment of truth.

00:10:17.150 --> 00:10:19.220
I don't have to
re-record this video.

00:10:19.220 --> 00:10:22.010
It's 417,354.

00:10:22.010 --> 00:10:24.510
But we did it without the
calculator, which is

00:10:24.510 --> 00:10:26.390
the important point.
