&gt;&gt; ROMAIN: Hi. My name is Romain. I'm an engineer
on the Android Project. And I'm here today

00:00:08.809 --> 00:00:13.000
with Dianne and Jeff, also engineers on the
Android Project. And we want to show you a

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:17.580
couple of demos that demonstrate that you
can extend and replace existing key components

00:00:17.580 --> 00:00:21.970
of the system because we believe that all
applications on Android systems are created

00:00:21.970 --> 00:00:25.640
equal. So Dianne will start by showing an
application she wrote with the current public

00:00:25.640 --> 00:00:28.480
SDK.
&gt;&gt; DIANNE: So one of the basic parts of a

00:00:28.480 --> 00:00:32.400
phone user interface is picking ringtones.
Android comes with a fairly simple ring tone

00:00:32.400 --> 00:00:36.190
picker. It goes and lets you pick between
a bunch of standard ringtones on the phone.

00:00:36.190 --> 00:00:39.910
I wanted to write something and let you do
a lot more. So on this phone, I've installed

00:00:39.910 --> 00:00:43.610
my application. Now, when you go and bring
up the ringtone picker, it lets me pick my

00:00:43.610 --> 00:00:49.040
application to run, and when I select it here,
I see my more sophisticated user interface.

00:00:49.040 --> 00:00:51.760
It does let you do a bunch of things. What
I'm going to do here is pick the music on

00:00:51.760 --> 00:00:56.490
my phone. It shows me all the music on my
phone. I can pick one of these songs like

00:00:56.490 --> 00:01:02.290
that, that sounds good, hit okay, and now
that's my new ring tone. Now, Jeff is going

00:01:02.290 --> 00:01:06.439
to show you other things you need to do to
extend applications on the phone.

00:01:06.439 --> 00:01:09.950
&gt;&gt; JEFF: Thanks, Dianne. One really cool thing
about Android is you can create shortcuts

00:01:09.950 --> 00:01:13.600
on the desktop. But you can't create shortcuts
to everything, so I wrote Any Cut that lets

00:01:13.600 --> 00:01:17.820
you create a shortcut to anything in the system.
To create a new shortcut with Any Cut, just

00:01:17.820 --> 00:01:21.940
long press on the home screen, select Any
Cut. Here, you have a list of things you can

00:01:21.940 --> 00:01:26.510
create shortcuts to. One of the most popular
ones is direct call. You should tap here,

00:01:26.510 --> 00:01:30.390
and it launches contacts to get a list of
who you have phone numbers for. Select one,

00:01:30.390 --> 00:01:34.520
let's say, Romain, click okay, and now your
call to Romain is just one tap away.

00:01:34.520 --> 00:01:38.520
&gt;&gt; ROMAIN: Jeff just showed us how to add
exciting new features to existing applications,

00:01:38.520 --> 00:01:42.450
and Dianne showed us how to replace simple
components on the system. But because we strongly

00:01:42.450 --> 00:01:46.510
believe that all applications are created
equal, we even let you replace key components

00:01:46.510 --> 00:01:50.280
of the system, for instance, the home screen.
I have here a phone in which I downloaded

00:01:50.280 --> 00:01:54.370
a new home screen from the Android Markets.
You can see its page here. So now, when I

00:01:54.370 --> 00:01:59.200
press the home key, I have the choice between
the old home and the new home screen. So because

00:01:59.200 --> 00:02:03.060
I prefer the new one, I just click on it and
I'm presented with a new experience that I

00:02:03.060 --> 00:02:09.060
prefer. So we hope that these demos demonstrated
that you can customize your user experience

00:02:09.060 --> 00:02:12.220
by adding new features or replacing the existing
feature on Android.
