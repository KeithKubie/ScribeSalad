we were able to suggest if not also

of serotonin he discovered that

serotonin in primates was associated
 

00:02:20.950 --> 00:02:24.060
serotonin in primates was associated
with high status and that when animals

00:02:24.060 --> 00:02:24.070
with high status and that when animals
 

00:02:24.070 --> 00:02:25.920
with high status and that when animals
had high status they felt better

00:02:25.920 --> 00:02:25.930
had high status they felt better
 

00:02:25.930 --> 00:02:29.460
had high status they felt better
not unreasonable if you took away their

00:02:29.460 --> 00:02:29.470
not unreasonable if you took away their
 

00:02:29.470 --> 00:02:31.620
not unreasonable if you took away their
high status their serotonin levels would

00:02:31.620 --> 00:02:31.630
high status their serotonin levels would
 

00:02:31.630 --> 00:02:35.400
high status their serotonin levels would
crash their brains would begin producing

00:02:35.400 --> 00:02:35.410

with feeling mean and feeling bad and
 

00:02:42.370 --> 00:02:46.020
with feeling mean and feeling bad and
feeling low and so we decided that one
