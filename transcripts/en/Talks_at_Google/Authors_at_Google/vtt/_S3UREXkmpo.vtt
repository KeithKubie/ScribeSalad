SPEAKER 1: Well,
welcome everyone.

00:00:07.330 --> 00:00:09.810
We're excited to
have everyone here

00:00:09.810 --> 00:00:12.100
to hear-- to speak with
William Paul Young.

00:00:12.100 --> 00:00:15.240
Part of trying to organize
these talks to people that

00:00:15.240 --> 00:00:19.770
can talk on issues for answers
that Google doesn't have

00:00:19.770 --> 00:00:21.050
answers for.

00:00:21.050 --> 00:00:24.060
And so we're excited to have
William Paul, that certainly

00:00:24.060 --> 00:00:27.060
has opened up a lot of questions
with his book "The Shack."

00:00:27.060 --> 00:00:28.957
So it was released
over 10 years ago

00:00:28.957 --> 00:00:30.540
and has become one
of the best selling

00:00:30.540 --> 00:00:32.580
books of the 21st century.

00:00:32.580 --> 00:00:35.590
It was actually recently
made into a film,

00:00:35.590 --> 00:00:36.716
which Google is very proud.

00:00:36.716 --> 00:00:38.840
We were one of the first
to have electronic rights,

00:00:38.840 --> 00:00:40.260
so it was released
just this week

00:00:40.260 --> 00:00:42.360
on Google Play and YouTube.

00:00:42.360 --> 00:00:44.760
So for those who have
not read the book,

00:00:44.760 --> 00:00:45.930
we have free copies today.

00:00:45.930 --> 00:00:48.360
You can actually watch
the movie as well.

00:00:48.360 --> 00:00:51.010
Paul is actually the
author of many other books,

00:00:51.010 --> 00:00:54.810
including "Eve," "Crossroads,"
and the recently released

00:00:54.810 --> 00:00:56.850
"Lies We Believe About God."

00:00:56.850 --> 00:01:00.000
So for any other questions,
please Google his name.

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:02.790
There's plenty out there, but
I will give plenty of time

00:01:02.790 --> 00:01:06.164
because he has a lot
to share with us today.

00:01:06.164 --> 00:01:09.601
[APPLAUSE]

00:01:13.012 --> 00:01:14.470
WILLIAM PAUL YOUNG:
Good afternoon.

00:01:14.470 --> 00:01:17.680
Just barely, but it's so
good to be here at Apple.

00:01:17.680 --> 00:01:18.490
I'm just kidding.

00:01:21.160 --> 00:01:25.690
I figured with a
minimalist stage--

00:01:25.690 --> 00:01:26.890
I'm just saying.

00:01:26.890 --> 00:01:30.940
So let me tell you a
little bit about who I am

00:01:30.940 --> 00:01:34.210
and what my background is.

00:01:34.210 --> 00:01:36.240
I'm married to Kim.

00:01:36.240 --> 00:01:38.517
It will be 38
years in September.

00:01:41.790 --> 00:01:45.180
I have-- we have six children.

00:01:45.180 --> 00:01:49.740
Our age range is 23 to 36.

00:01:49.740 --> 00:01:52.980
We have our 10th
grandbaby on the way.

00:01:52.980 --> 00:01:55.470
They're all nine
years old and under,

00:01:55.470 --> 00:02:00.577
and that's the best
thing I've ever done,

00:02:00.577 --> 00:02:02.410
being married and having
children and having

00:02:02.410 --> 00:02:03.310
grandchildren.

00:02:06.010 --> 00:02:08.590
My background, which
I thought was normal

00:02:08.590 --> 00:02:12.370
until I left the world
that I grew up in--

00:02:12.370 --> 00:02:14.742
I'm a missionary kid,
third culture kid.

00:02:14.742 --> 00:02:16.450
I grew up in the
highlands of New Guinea.

00:02:16.450 --> 00:02:20.500
My parents were missionaries,
pioneer missionaries,

00:02:20.500 --> 00:02:23.440
Protestant, fundamentalist,
evangelical.

00:02:23.440 --> 00:02:26.880
And I was a year old when
we moved into the highlands.

00:02:26.880 --> 00:02:28.255
So I grew up in
a tribal culture.

00:02:31.900 --> 00:02:33.800
New Guinea is very unusual.

00:02:33.800 --> 00:02:38.080
It has over 800 unrelated
language groups.

00:02:38.080 --> 00:02:40.570
And our tribe was one
of the bigger ones--

00:02:40.570 --> 00:02:44.140
40,000 to 60,000 people
over 100 square miles.

00:02:44.140 --> 00:02:48.070
But their language
had never been

00:02:48.070 --> 00:02:50.380
heard outside of their culture.

00:02:50.380 --> 00:02:55.780
And going in as a year old,
it became my first language

00:02:55.780 --> 00:02:59.620
and my first dreaming language.

00:02:59.620 --> 00:03:00.830
It was my language.

00:03:00.830 --> 00:03:03.070
And when I was five
years old, Wycliffe

00:03:03.070 --> 00:03:05.080
came in to translate
the language,

00:03:05.080 --> 00:03:08.170
and I was the
informant because I'm

00:03:08.170 --> 00:03:10.855
the only one that could
speak it fluently, Ndani--

00:03:10.855 --> 00:03:13.600
and Ndani is a
dialect-- and English.

00:03:13.600 --> 00:03:18.920
So sent to boarding
school when I was six.

00:03:18.920 --> 00:03:22.810
I had some really great
advantages growing up

00:03:22.810 --> 00:03:25.040
in a multicultural world.

00:03:25.040 --> 00:03:28.330
It gave me an ability to
look from outside the box.

00:03:28.330 --> 00:03:29.650
I think that was a great gift.

00:03:29.650 --> 00:03:35.050
It gave me a facility to
move in and out of culture,

00:03:35.050 --> 00:03:40.630
but it left some really deep
losses at the same time.

00:03:40.630 --> 00:03:42.640
Part of it was the
way that I grew up.

00:03:42.640 --> 00:03:45.730
I had a very angry
young man father

00:03:45.730 --> 00:03:48.040
who didn't have a
chip for being a dad,

00:03:48.040 --> 00:03:54.610
and so he was an
abusive disciplinarian.

00:03:54.610 --> 00:03:57.070
And it took me, in
terms of my journey,

00:03:57.070 --> 00:03:58.900
so that you have
a sense of this--

00:03:58.900 --> 00:04:02.020
it took me 50 years to
wipe the face of my father

00:04:02.020 --> 00:04:02.920
off the face of God.

00:04:05.560 --> 00:04:07.840
And then the second
great sadness

00:04:07.840 --> 00:04:09.520
that I had was the
sexual abuse that

00:04:09.520 --> 00:04:14.140
started in the tribal culture
and that then continued

00:04:14.140 --> 00:04:15.640
in missionary boarding school.

00:04:15.640 --> 00:04:19.660
The big boys would molest
the little boys at night,

00:04:19.660 --> 00:04:23.170
and so that kind of tore the
fabric of my soul to shreds.

00:04:23.170 --> 00:04:25.960
And then the issue of belonging
that a lot of third culture

00:04:25.960 --> 00:04:27.550
kids have.

00:04:27.550 --> 00:04:29.500
If we don't find
someone to belong to,

00:04:29.500 --> 00:04:31.060
we never belong anywhere.

00:04:31.060 --> 00:04:33.910
It's not a geography anymore.

00:04:33.910 --> 00:04:36.821
And so as a first-born
missionary kid,

00:04:36.821 --> 00:04:39.070
preacher's kid-- because
when we came back to Canada--

00:04:39.070 --> 00:04:41.810
I was born in Canada--

00:04:41.810 --> 00:04:44.830
my father was an itinerant
pastor, and we moved a lot.

00:04:44.830 --> 00:04:48.550
I went to 13 schools before
I graduated high school.

00:04:48.550 --> 00:04:54.460
And I became a performer,
first-born performer.

00:04:54.460 --> 00:04:59.680
And at the same time, I'm on
a journey of spirituality,

00:04:59.680 --> 00:05:02.740
trying to figure out
my roots, being based

00:05:02.740 --> 00:05:06.770
in evangelical Christianity.

00:05:06.770 --> 00:05:08.740
And I'm lost in my head.

00:05:08.740 --> 00:05:11.230
I became an intellectual
rationalist,

00:05:11.230 --> 00:05:14.540
because that's the only safe
place that I could find.

00:05:14.540 --> 00:05:18.920
Because everything below
the neck was pretty broken.

00:05:18.920 --> 00:05:23.100
And I functioned by trying
to live from the outside in.

00:05:23.100 --> 00:05:26.440
So "The Shack," in a sense,
besides just being a story,

00:05:26.440 --> 00:05:29.470
becomes a metaphor,
becomes a parable.

00:05:29.470 --> 00:05:33.730
And the shack
itself, on one level,

00:05:33.730 --> 00:05:37.260
is the house on the inside
that people help us build.

00:05:37.260 --> 00:05:39.670
And a lot of us, we
didn't get good help,

00:05:39.670 --> 00:05:41.510
and so it becomes
a broken place.

00:05:41.510 --> 00:05:43.360
It's our own soul.

00:05:43.360 --> 00:05:45.730
It's the broken heart
of a human being,

00:05:45.730 --> 00:05:48.790
and it becomes a place we
store all of our addictions

00:05:48.790 --> 00:05:50.200
and we hide all of our secrets.

00:05:50.200 --> 00:05:52.300
And we never want to
invade another human being

00:05:52.300 --> 00:05:57.040
into that place because we're
terrified that if we do they

00:05:57.040 --> 00:05:59.360
will hate us as much as we do.

00:05:59.360 --> 00:06:00.790
And so we become a performer.

00:06:00.790 --> 00:06:03.460
We set up something
outside, a facade

00:06:03.460 --> 00:06:05.770
that we can paint as
fast as we can pick up

00:06:05.770 --> 00:06:08.080
people's expectations.

00:06:08.080 --> 00:06:15.460
And that became the
metaphor for my own heart.

00:06:15.460 --> 00:06:17.922
I've always been a
writer, like anybody does.

00:06:17.922 --> 00:06:19.630
You know, you write
stuff and you give it

00:06:19.630 --> 00:06:20.830
to your friends and
family, and they

00:06:20.830 --> 00:06:22.413
think it's the best
thing in the world

00:06:22.413 --> 00:06:25.330
because they're your
friends or family.

00:06:25.330 --> 00:06:28.360
And I had written gifts over the
years for friends and family.

00:06:28.360 --> 00:06:32.880
And Kim, my wife, had been
saying for about four years,

00:06:32.880 --> 00:06:34.720
Someday, as a gift
for our children,

00:06:34.720 --> 00:06:37.300
would you write something
that puts in one place

00:06:37.300 --> 00:06:39.040
how you think?

00:06:39.040 --> 00:06:41.800
Because you think
outside the box.

00:06:41.800 --> 00:06:44.650
And I didn't feel healthy
enough to do that.

00:06:44.650 --> 00:06:46.162
I didn't know what that was.

00:06:46.162 --> 00:06:47.620
She didn't, either,
and by the way,

00:06:47.620 --> 00:06:50.307
when the book eventually
got printed, she said to me,

00:06:50.307 --> 00:06:51.890
you know, when I
asked you to do this,

00:06:51.890 --> 00:06:53.473
I was thinking like
four to six pages.

00:06:56.810 --> 00:06:59.920
But I love story,
and story has a way

00:06:59.920 --> 00:07:03.790
of sneaking past our watchful
dragons, as Lewis would say.

00:07:03.790 --> 00:07:07.030
And story-- we have
an affinity for it,

00:07:07.030 --> 00:07:09.760
because every single
human being is a story.

00:07:09.760 --> 00:07:13.360
And so I wanted to
write them a story.

00:07:13.360 --> 00:07:15.520
And the year I
turned 50, I finally

00:07:15.520 --> 00:07:18.520
felt healthy enough
to do it, and I

00:07:18.520 --> 00:07:21.830
did it mostly on the train
to one of my three jobs.

00:07:21.830 --> 00:07:22.900
I was working three jobs.

00:07:22.900 --> 00:07:25.570
I was doing shipping and
receiving for a circuit board

00:07:25.570 --> 00:07:26.800
manufacturing company.

00:07:26.800 --> 00:07:28.840
I did all the
janitorial, so I did

00:07:28.840 --> 00:07:31.390
all the toilets and the floors.

00:07:31.390 --> 00:07:34.960
And then I was a hotel night
clerk on the side part-time,

00:07:34.960 --> 00:07:38.410
and part-time was doing web
conferencing on the web.

00:07:38.410 --> 00:07:44.040
And then I worked on a hotline
in a food processing company.

00:07:44.040 --> 00:07:50.680
And the year before
I wrote the story,

00:07:50.680 --> 00:07:55.570
was the 11th year of a
dismantling and rebuilding

00:07:55.570 --> 00:07:59.230
process that is represented
by Mackenzie's weekend

00:07:59.230 --> 00:08:00.520
in the shack.

00:08:00.520 --> 00:08:03.850
In the book, Mackenzie
is the main character.

00:08:03.850 --> 00:08:05.525
People ask me, is
this a true story?

00:08:05.525 --> 00:08:06.900
And I tell them,
yeah, it's true.

00:08:06.900 --> 00:08:08.110
It's just not real.

00:08:08.110 --> 00:08:13.150
Like all parables-- they're all
true, they're just not real.

00:08:13.150 --> 00:08:18.850
And I wrote this as a story
to communicate to my children.

00:08:18.850 --> 00:08:20.540
I wrote it for
them for Christmas.

00:08:20.540 --> 00:08:24.190
That's the whole goal, was
to get it done for Christmas.

00:08:24.190 --> 00:08:29.789
At Christmas, I made 15
copies at Office Depot.

00:08:29.789 --> 00:08:32.289
And I like to tell people there
are two things that you need

00:08:32.289 --> 00:08:34.630
to understand about
this whole crazy thing

00:08:34.630 --> 00:08:36.590
that I'm in the middle of.

00:08:36.590 --> 00:08:41.659
Those 15 copies did everything
I ever wanted that book to do.

00:08:41.659 --> 00:08:45.650
I had never-- it never once
crossed my mind to publish it.

00:08:45.650 --> 00:08:47.780
I mean, that's not my world.

00:08:47.780 --> 00:08:50.090
I didn't know anything
about it, and it just

00:08:50.090 --> 00:08:52.040
wasn't on my bucket
list or anything else.

00:08:52.040 --> 00:08:54.470
I wrote this as a
gift for my children,

00:08:54.470 --> 00:08:58.550
trying to say, let me tell
you about the God who actually

00:08:58.550 --> 00:09:02.960
showed up and healed my heart,
not the God I grew up with.

00:09:02.960 --> 00:09:05.279
That's why when Papa God
comes through the door,

00:09:05.279 --> 00:09:07.070
he doesn't come through
the door as Gandalf

00:09:07.070 --> 00:09:09.470
with a bad attitude--

00:09:09.470 --> 00:09:11.990
white-bearded,
distant, grandfatherly,

00:09:11.990 --> 00:09:13.092
that whole thing.

00:09:13.092 --> 00:09:15.050
Because I'm trying to
get as far away from that

00:09:15.050 --> 00:09:17.250
imagery as possible.

00:09:17.250 --> 00:09:18.770
And the other
thing I tell people

00:09:18.770 --> 00:09:23.480
is that you need to know that
everything that matters to me

00:09:23.480 --> 00:09:26.360
was in place before
I wrote the book--

00:09:26.360 --> 00:09:29.120
identity, worth, value,
significance, security,

00:09:29.120 --> 00:09:32.330
meaning, purpose, destiny,
community, and love.

00:09:32.330 --> 00:09:35.820
They were all in place
before I wrote the book.

00:09:35.820 --> 00:09:40.680
And I'm so grateful for
that, because a lot of times

00:09:40.680 --> 00:09:43.590
if those things are not
in place, you use work

00:09:43.590 --> 00:09:45.750
or you use creativity
or you use whatever

00:09:45.750 --> 00:09:49.170
to gain identity, worth,
value, significance, security,

00:09:49.170 --> 00:09:51.309
meaning, purpose, destiny,
community, and love.

00:09:51.309 --> 00:09:53.850
And then you start to suck the
life out of your relationships

00:09:53.850 --> 00:09:56.550
and the people around you.

00:09:56.550 --> 00:09:59.220
And all of those
things were in place.

00:09:59.220 --> 00:10:02.280
The book didn't add any
of those things to me.

00:10:02.280 --> 00:10:08.730
What it gave me as a gift, which
I will be forever grateful for,

00:10:08.730 --> 00:10:11.130
is an invitation
into the holy ground

00:10:11.130 --> 00:10:14.650
of other people's stories.

00:10:14.650 --> 00:10:19.300
Let me give you an example,
and I'll do it from the movie.

00:10:19.300 --> 00:10:22.660
I didn't anticipate being
involved in the film.

00:10:22.660 --> 00:10:25.570
When I laid the rights down,
I laid them down 100%--

00:10:25.570 --> 00:10:31.870
no creative control,
no rights, period.

00:10:31.870 --> 00:10:35.410
Which was fine-- in the
course of how this unfolded,

00:10:35.410 --> 00:10:37.750
it worked, and it
was fine by me.

00:10:37.750 --> 00:10:40.460
So I did not anticipate
being involved.

00:10:40.460 --> 00:10:45.220
Lionsgate called me up and
said, would you come talk to us?

00:10:45.220 --> 00:10:48.700
I think they were
partly checking me out

00:10:48.700 --> 00:10:53.180
to see if I would be an
enemy of the project,

00:10:53.180 --> 00:10:55.120
but I don't know that for sure.

00:10:55.120 --> 00:10:58.120
But we didn't end up talking
about the movie or business

00:10:58.120 --> 00:10:59.110
or anything.

00:10:59.110 --> 00:11:03.310
All we did is told
stories and cried a lot,

00:11:03.310 --> 00:11:07.150
because everybody in this
room, everybody in humanity,

00:11:07.150 --> 00:11:10.690
knows about love and
knows about loss.

00:11:10.690 --> 00:11:12.520
All of our divisions,
politically,

00:11:12.520 --> 00:11:16.670
ethnically, all of that,
we do have these things

00:11:16.670 --> 00:11:18.800
in common, love and loss.

00:11:18.800 --> 00:11:23.810
And the book is a human
story about loss and love.

00:11:23.810 --> 00:11:26.772
And so it was great.

00:11:26.772 --> 00:11:27.980
I had a great time with them.

00:11:27.980 --> 00:11:34.490
Well, a number of months later,
I get a call from Gil Netter.

00:11:34.490 --> 00:11:36.740
He was the producer for "Life
of Pi," "Marley and Me,"

00:11:36.740 --> 00:11:38.960
"Blind Side," and
20 other movies,

00:11:38.960 --> 00:11:41.210
and he was the producer
for "The Shack."

00:11:41.210 --> 00:11:45.950
And he said, would you
please look at the script

00:11:45.950 --> 00:11:48.140
and give us your feedback?

00:11:48.140 --> 00:11:49.220
Sure.

00:11:49.220 --> 00:11:50.490
So I was able to do that.

00:11:50.490 --> 00:11:54.140
Then they said, what do you
think about these actors?

00:11:54.140 --> 00:11:56.270
And so that was part
of the conversation.

00:11:56.270 --> 00:11:59.720
Not any of it did they have to
take seriously, you understand,

00:11:59.720 --> 00:12:02.580
because I had no creative
control, no rights.

00:12:02.580 --> 00:12:06.400
They said, well,
would you come--

00:12:06.400 --> 00:12:09.470
Lionsgate calls me
and says, would you

00:12:09.470 --> 00:12:11.720
consider coming on
the first day's shoot

00:12:11.720 --> 00:12:15.730
and praying a blessing over
the entire cast and crew?

00:12:15.730 --> 00:12:17.110
Yeah.

00:12:17.110 --> 00:12:18.725
So I did.

00:12:18.725 --> 00:12:21.100
So the first day I'm on the
set, and they shot most of it

00:12:21.100 --> 00:12:22.760
in British Columbia.

00:12:22.760 --> 00:12:29.067
And so I'm on the set, and
I mean, it's so surreal.

00:12:29.067 --> 00:12:31.150
You write a story for your
kids, and it's becoming

00:12:31.150 --> 00:12:32.110
a major motion picture.

00:12:32.110 --> 00:12:35.000
And there are, like, 60
people being paid to do this.

00:12:35.000 --> 00:12:37.141
It is the weirdest thing ever.

00:12:37.141 --> 00:12:39.640
And at the end of the day, I'm
just standing there watching.

00:12:39.640 --> 00:12:46.570
And Gil Netter yells, hey,
Paul, you want to be in a cameo?

00:12:46.570 --> 00:12:48.457
I said, like in the movie?

00:12:48.457 --> 00:12:49.040
He says, yeah.

00:12:49.040 --> 00:12:51.630
He says, I've never shot a movie
where the author was alive,

00:12:51.630 --> 00:12:58.110
a book adaptation that I
didn't put the author in it.

00:12:58.110 --> 00:12:59.800
I said, sure, my kids
are going to love

00:12:59.800 --> 00:13:01.120
this, what do I have to do?

00:13:01.120 --> 00:13:04.450
He says, all you have to do
is walk through this scene.

00:13:04.450 --> 00:13:07.470
Well, I've walked
most of my life.

00:13:07.470 --> 00:13:09.640
How hard can this be, right?

00:13:09.640 --> 00:13:13.330
And it only took five takes.

00:13:13.330 --> 00:13:15.930
Because you don't think
about walking when you walk.

00:13:15.930 --> 00:13:17.657
It's like, oh.

00:13:17.657 --> 00:13:19.240
So he was like, oh,
let's do it again,

00:13:19.240 --> 00:13:21.640
this time slow down a little
bit, don't photo bomb--

00:13:21.640 --> 00:13:22.900
whatever.

00:13:22.900 --> 00:13:25.450
And so you'll have
to look for it.

00:13:25.450 --> 00:13:26.710
It's all of two seconds.

00:13:26.710 --> 00:13:31.030
But just look for kind of
a short, elderly, balding,

00:13:31.030 --> 00:13:36.480
overweight white guy who
just walks through the scene.

00:13:36.480 --> 00:13:38.140
But it was just incredible.

00:13:38.140 --> 00:13:43.540
Well, a few months later, I
get a call, and they said,

00:13:43.540 --> 00:13:46.160
would you consider
coming back on the set?

00:13:46.160 --> 00:13:49.050
And they were near the
end of their shoot.

00:13:49.050 --> 00:13:50.300
It was like 60 days.

00:13:50.300 --> 00:13:52.400
And if you know
anything about movies--

00:13:52.400 --> 00:13:56.150
which I didn't but it's
a great learning curve--

00:13:56.150 --> 00:13:59.870
they have multiple
locations being shot.

00:13:59.870 --> 00:14:02.150
And they're all out of
order, depending on when

00:14:02.150 --> 00:14:03.260
the actors are available.

00:14:03.260 --> 00:14:06.000
So sometimes the
actors are available.

00:14:06.000 --> 00:14:09.396
And so the first day shoot,
in fact, was the scene--

00:14:09.396 --> 00:14:11.270
and the one that I walk
through, is the scene

00:14:11.270 --> 00:14:15.290
when Willie, played by Tim
McGraw, and Sam Worthington,

00:14:15.290 --> 00:14:16.790
played by Mackenzie--
they're having

00:14:16.790 --> 00:14:19.220
a conversation as the kids
are being piled into the car

00:14:19.220 --> 00:14:21.100
to go camping.

00:14:21.100 --> 00:14:25.400
And this is the one
where Tim walks over,

00:14:25.400 --> 00:14:28.400
and the scene begins with
him saying he's got a dog.

00:14:28.400 --> 00:14:30.770
And he says,
summer's last hurrah.

00:14:30.770 --> 00:14:32.280
That's the first line.

00:14:32.280 --> 00:14:34.790
And in that scene, there's
a shot right at Tim McGraw,

00:14:34.790 --> 00:14:37.040
and that's when you'll see
me walk through that scene.

00:14:40.790 --> 00:14:44.150
But on that day, Octavia
Spencer, who plays Papa,

00:14:44.150 --> 00:14:46.780
was not there, nor Graham
Greene, who also plays Papa.

00:14:49.670 --> 00:14:51.920
But Aviv wasn't there,
who plays Jesus,

00:14:51.920 --> 00:14:55.474
and Sumi, who plays the
Holy Spirit, wasn't there.

00:14:55.474 --> 00:14:57.890
So the first day's shoot, the
Father, Son, and Holy Spirit

00:14:57.890 --> 00:15:02.880
are absent, at least
in any visible sense.

00:15:02.880 --> 00:15:07.266
So later, 60 days later,
I get a call saying,

00:15:07.266 --> 00:15:09.890
we're near the end of the shoot,
would you consider coming back

00:15:09.890 --> 00:15:12.110
on the set for another day?

00:15:12.110 --> 00:15:13.960
And I said, sure.

00:15:13.960 --> 00:15:15.710
They said, here's what
we're going to do.

00:15:15.710 --> 00:15:21.440
Wednesday, we're going to
fly you up to Vancouver, BC,

00:15:21.440 --> 00:15:25.325
and then transport will take you
to a hotel in Chilliwack, which

00:15:25.325 --> 00:15:27.200
is about two and a half
hours from Vancouver,

00:15:27.200 --> 00:15:28.430
depending on traffic.

00:15:28.430 --> 00:15:29.810
And it's in the valley.

00:15:29.810 --> 00:15:34.220
And then that night, Wednesday
night, you'll get a call sheet

00:15:34.220 --> 00:15:36.440
that will tell you when
we're picking you up Thursday

00:15:36.440 --> 00:15:39.140
and where we're taking you.

00:15:39.140 --> 00:15:41.270
And then you'll spend all
day Thursday on the set.

00:15:41.270 --> 00:15:46.490
Friday, transport will take you
back to Vancouver to fly out.

00:15:46.490 --> 00:15:48.300
Simple.

00:15:48.300 --> 00:15:49.800
This is great.

00:15:49.800 --> 00:15:53.040
Well, I'm thinking about this
as I'm sitting at my desk

00:15:53.040 --> 00:15:55.750
after we've got this all set up.

00:15:55.750 --> 00:15:56.900
And I think, you know what?

00:15:56.900 --> 00:15:58.890
There's a guy I've
been trying to meet

00:15:58.890 --> 00:16:02.100
who lives in Abbotsford,
which is right next door

00:16:02.100 --> 00:16:04.440
to Chilliwack,
where my hotel is.

00:16:04.440 --> 00:16:05.867
And I've been
trying to meet him.

00:16:05.867 --> 00:16:07.700
I had a lot of email
conversations with him.

00:16:07.700 --> 00:16:10.080
He's a theologian
named Brad Jersak.

00:16:10.080 --> 00:16:12.390
And in fact, I'd endorse
his last book, which

00:16:12.390 --> 00:16:16.020
is "A More Christlike God."

00:16:16.020 --> 00:16:18.480
And he'd read "Eve"
and was all over it.

00:16:18.480 --> 00:16:20.360
He's a patristic theologian.

00:16:20.360 --> 00:16:23.700
And so we'd had all
these conversations.

00:16:23.700 --> 00:16:27.810
I'd actually met his wife Eden
once, a number of years before.

00:16:27.810 --> 00:16:31.140
But Brad spends a good
chunk of his year in London

00:16:31.140 --> 00:16:32.790
because he's a
seminary professor

00:16:32.790 --> 00:16:34.860
at a seminary in London.

00:16:34.860 --> 00:16:38.850
And so he and I had always
been passing but hadn't met.

00:16:38.850 --> 00:16:41.700
And I'm thinking, I don't even
know if he's on the continent,

00:16:41.700 --> 00:16:45.407
but I'll send him an email and
see if he happens to be around.

00:16:45.407 --> 00:16:47.490
So I send him an email
telling him what I'm doing,

00:16:47.490 --> 00:16:49.120
coming up Wednesday.

00:16:49.120 --> 00:16:50.790
Do you happen to be in town?

00:16:50.790 --> 00:16:53.070
I immediately get an email back.

00:16:53.070 --> 00:16:55.287
Can I come pick you
up at the airport?

00:16:55.287 --> 00:16:57.120
He said, we'll spend
the whole day together,

00:16:57.120 --> 00:16:59.840
we'll have supper with Eden,
and then I'll drop you off

00:16:59.840 --> 00:17:02.010
in Chilliwack at your hotel.

00:17:02.010 --> 00:17:03.150
Great.

00:17:03.150 --> 00:17:04.440
So I called transport.

00:17:04.440 --> 00:17:07.000
They're thrilled because it
saves them five hours round

00:17:07.000 --> 00:17:09.510
trip, and it's great.

00:17:09.510 --> 00:17:11.940
So it's all set.

00:17:11.940 --> 00:17:15.599
Well, 10 minutes later I
get another email from Brad.

00:17:15.599 --> 00:17:19.170
This time it's got a
photo attached to it,

00:17:19.170 --> 00:17:21.119
and it's got a picture of Brad.

00:17:21.119 --> 00:17:22.920
Because I'd seen
pictures of him.

00:17:22.920 --> 00:17:25.319
And there's another
guy next to him,

00:17:25.319 --> 00:17:28.590
and they're in the
middle of the woods.

00:17:28.590 --> 00:17:35.200
And Brad says, hey, Paul,
while we were emailing,

00:17:35.200 --> 00:17:37.870
one of my long-life
best friends Dwight

00:17:37.870 --> 00:17:39.910
and I were walking in the woods.

00:17:39.910 --> 00:17:44.350
Dwight and his wife Laurie
have a cabin summer cottage

00:17:44.350 --> 00:17:47.390
up at Cultus Lake.

00:17:47.390 --> 00:17:50.410
And we are spending
a few days with them.

00:17:50.410 --> 00:17:53.790
And while we were
emailing, Dwight and I--

00:17:53.790 --> 00:17:56.830
and he says, Dwight, by
the way, is a business guy.

00:17:56.830 --> 00:18:00.700
His wife Laurie is a
spiritual formations director.

00:18:00.700 --> 00:18:03.340
But Dwight is the first person
who told me about "The Shack"

00:18:03.340 --> 00:18:06.720
in 2008 and gave
me my first copy.

00:18:06.720 --> 00:18:10.510
But we're walking in the
woods, and look, next to them

00:18:10.510 --> 00:18:14.650
is a big arrow that's
green or yellow--

00:18:14.650 --> 00:18:16.687
I can't remember what
the color is supposed

00:18:16.687 --> 00:18:17.770
to be in British Columbia.

00:18:17.770 --> 00:18:21.650
But it says "The Shack."

00:18:21.650 --> 00:18:23.890
There's a set location
two and a half blocks away

00:18:23.890 --> 00:18:26.346
from Dwight's house, and
he didn't even know it.

00:18:26.346 --> 00:18:28.720
And as they're walking in the
woods, as he's emailing me,

00:18:28.720 --> 00:18:30.640
they run right into it.

00:18:30.640 --> 00:18:34.120
And it's like, look,
how cool is this.

00:18:34.120 --> 00:18:36.620
So I'm going, like,
this is great.

00:18:36.620 --> 00:18:38.440
And then he sends
me a second email

00:18:38.440 --> 00:18:40.360
right on the heels
of that one and says,

00:18:40.360 --> 00:18:41.920
I don't know if
it would work out

00:18:41.920 --> 00:18:44.110
because I don't know
where you're going to be.

00:18:44.110 --> 00:18:45.390
Because I don't know.

00:18:45.390 --> 00:18:47.650
It could be at any one of
these multiple locations

00:18:47.650 --> 00:18:52.020
for the set sites, and I don't
know what they're shooting.

00:18:52.020 --> 00:18:55.570
So he says, if
there's any way, I

00:18:55.570 --> 00:18:57.600
think it would be
really important if you

00:18:57.600 --> 00:19:01.590
could find even 10 minutes to
spend with Dwight and Laurie.

00:19:01.590 --> 00:19:04.440
Your book had a massive
impact in their lives.

00:19:04.440 --> 00:19:07.230
About three years ago the
youngest of their children,

00:19:07.230 --> 00:19:11.060
16 years old, took her own
life in the middle of the woods

00:19:11.060 --> 00:19:12.830
in a tree house.

00:19:12.830 --> 00:19:17.222
And Dwight's stuck and
Laurie is completely stuck.

00:19:17.222 --> 00:19:18.930
And Dwight believes
that if he could just

00:19:18.930 --> 00:19:20.820
read "The Shack" again,
he could get unstuck,

00:19:20.820 --> 00:19:23.250
but he can't get
past chapter one.

00:19:23.250 --> 00:19:29.650
And Laurie is so angry
because her daughter is dead.

00:19:29.650 --> 00:19:34.000
Her daughter is dead, and she
is furious, furious at God.

00:19:34.000 --> 00:19:36.100
And she can't get past this.

00:19:36.100 --> 00:19:40.750
And they're lost, so even if
you could spend 10 minutes.

00:19:40.750 --> 00:19:43.004
And I am like, [GASP].

00:19:43.004 --> 00:19:44.920
And I email back and
say, we'll figure it out.

00:19:44.920 --> 00:19:47.450
Even if I have to spend
an extra day or something,

00:19:47.450 --> 00:19:48.970
we'll figure it out.

00:19:48.970 --> 00:19:53.390
So I fly up on Wednesday.

00:19:53.390 --> 00:19:54.350
Brad picks me up.

00:19:54.350 --> 00:19:57.739
It's like meeting a
long-lost brother.

00:19:57.739 --> 00:19:59.780
You know those relationships
where the first time

00:19:59.780 --> 00:20:03.040
you meet it's like,
it's fully on?

00:20:03.040 --> 00:20:06.190
I mean, it's like,
where have you been?

00:20:06.190 --> 00:20:07.030
So it was like that.

00:20:07.030 --> 00:20:09.250
We had supper with Eden,
and then Brad drops me off.

00:20:09.250 --> 00:20:11.170
And I told him, I
said, I'll let you

00:20:11.170 --> 00:20:17.390
know when I find out where I'm
going, and we'll figure it out.

00:20:17.390 --> 00:20:21.040
And so I don't get a call
sheet until 11:30 that night.

00:20:21.040 --> 00:20:23.620
And it says, we're picking
you up at 9:30 in the morning

00:20:23.620 --> 00:20:26.980
and taking you to
Cultus Lake, the site

00:20:26.980 --> 00:20:28.829
location on Cultus Lake.

00:20:28.829 --> 00:20:31.120
So I'm going to end up being
two and a half blocks away

00:20:31.120 --> 00:20:32.776
from their little
summer cottage.

00:20:32.776 --> 00:20:35.840
And I'm going, like,
OK, that's cool.

00:20:35.840 --> 00:20:39.250
So I get up there in the
morning and I'm texting Brad.

00:20:39.250 --> 00:20:41.200
And he's saying, we're here.

00:20:41.200 --> 00:20:42.940
We're 2 and 1/2 blocks away.

00:20:42.940 --> 00:20:44.855
So we'll have food ready
for you any time you

00:20:44.855 --> 00:20:45.730
want to take a break.

00:20:45.730 --> 00:20:48.900
You just let us know, and we'll
meet you down the waterfront.

00:20:48.900 --> 00:20:53.010
And even if you can
spend 10 minutes.

00:20:53.010 --> 00:20:56.930
So I walk over to Gil
and Lonnie Netter--

00:20:56.930 --> 00:20:58.920
Lonnie is Gil's wife--

00:20:58.920 --> 00:21:02.510
and Stuart Hazeldine,
who is the producer.

00:21:02.510 --> 00:21:05.910
And they're standing,
talking to each other.

00:21:05.910 --> 00:21:08.810
And I walk over to them because
I had just gotten there.

00:21:08.810 --> 00:21:10.730
And one of the reasons
that they wanted

00:21:10.730 --> 00:21:12.440
me to come to this
site location is this

00:21:12.440 --> 00:21:14.690
is where they built the shack.

00:21:14.690 --> 00:21:16.550
And they built it
three different times,

00:21:16.550 --> 00:21:18.410
but it's all on the same site.

00:21:18.410 --> 00:21:20.630
And they wanted me to see it.

00:21:20.630 --> 00:21:26.030
Plus Octavia was there, Aviv
was there, and Sumi was there,

00:21:26.030 --> 00:21:27.750
and I hadn't met them.

00:21:27.750 --> 00:21:34.500
And so when I had gotten that
email, after my little nudge

00:21:34.500 --> 00:21:38.370
to contact Brad, and he had
told me about Dwight and Laurie,

00:21:38.370 --> 00:21:44.260
I sent Gil and Lonnie
Netter and Stuart the email.

00:21:44.260 --> 00:21:49.360
And I said, here
is another story

00:21:49.360 --> 00:21:53.140
that pertains to the movie
that you guys are working on,

00:21:53.140 --> 00:21:55.450
just so you know.

00:21:55.450 --> 00:21:57.770
Well, I walk over to
them and I say, hey,

00:21:57.770 --> 00:22:00.220
you know that email
that I just sent you

00:22:00.220 --> 00:22:03.250
about Dwight and Laurie Martin?

00:22:03.250 --> 00:22:06.130
Would there be any possibility
that my four friends could

00:22:06.130 --> 00:22:08.860
come on the set for the day?

00:22:08.860 --> 00:22:12.790
And not only did they say
yes, they said absolutely.

00:22:12.790 --> 00:22:14.650
And 20 minutes later,
down the waterfront,

00:22:14.650 --> 00:22:17.170
comes Brad, Eden,
Dwight, and Laurie.

00:22:17.170 --> 00:22:20.110
And they get embraced
into this community

00:22:20.110 --> 00:22:22.630
that is creating this movie.

00:22:22.630 --> 00:22:24.970
We don't know what
they're shooting that day.

00:22:24.970 --> 00:22:27.870
We're just thrilled to be there.

00:22:27.870 --> 00:22:34.561
So when they shoot a movie,
especially outside shots,

00:22:34.561 --> 00:22:37.060
you can't get close enough to
actually hear what's going on.

00:22:37.060 --> 00:22:38.560
Everything's miked up.

00:22:38.560 --> 00:22:41.980
And you can watch it at
a distance if you want,

00:22:41.980 --> 00:22:43.960
but they have what's
called a video village,

00:22:43.960 --> 00:22:45.640
which is just a big tent.

00:22:45.640 --> 00:22:46.622
And in that tent--

00:22:46.622 --> 00:22:48.580
it's set up for the
producer and the director--

00:22:48.580 --> 00:22:52.390
and they've got huge screens,
like five times bigger

00:22:52.390 --> 00:22:54.380
than those.

00:22:54.380 --> 00:22:56.500
And then they've
got headphones so

00:22:56.500 --> 00:22:58.840
that the producer and the
director can actually hear.

00:22:58.840 --> 00:23:00.340
And whatever they're
going to shoot,

00:23:00.340 --> 00:23:02.048
they're going to shoot
it multiple times.

00:23:02.048 --> 00:23:03.670
They had one shot
that they wanted

00:23:03.670 --> 00:23:06.040
to do all morning,
two and a half hours,

00:23:06.040 --> 00:23:09.520
one shot in the afternoon,
and one shot in the evening.

00:23:09.520 --> 00:23:13.000
So we still don't know
what they're shooting.

00:23:13.000 --> 00:23:15.220
They had five
chairs for us right

00:23:15.220 --> 00:23:18.547
in front of the monitors with
headphones so we could hear.

00:23:18.547 --> 00:23:20.380
And they're going to
shoot it over and over,

00:23:20.380 --> 00:23:22.330
because they want to get
different camera angles.

00:23:22.330 --> 00:23:24.621
They want to get different
expressions from the actors,

00:23:24.621 --> 00:23:25.600
whatever.

00:23:25.600 --> 00:23:27.340
So we sit down, put
our headphones on,

00:23:27.340 --> 00:23:30.670
and this is the first
scene that we see.

00:23:30.670 --> 00:23:34.090
It is the one where
Mackenzie has spent

00:23:34.090 --> 00:23:36.610
the night having nightmares.

00:23:36.610 --> 00:23:39.820
And he comes out on the
porch for breakfast,

00:23:39.820 --> 00:23:41.950
and Papa's got
breakfast for him.

00:23:41.950 --> 00:23:47.470
And you can see that he's just
struggled with these nightmares

00:23:47.470 --> 00:23:49.282
about the loss of his daughter.

00:23:49.282 --> 00:23:49.990
And he comes out.

00:23:49.990 --> 00:23:51.448
And this is the
one, if you've seen

00:23:51.448 --> 00:23:54.620
the movie, where Papa starts
the conversation with,

00:23:54.620 --> 00:23:57.020
you like Neil Young?

00:23:57.020 --> 00:24:00.010
I'm especially fond of him.

00:24:00.010 --> 00:24:04.271
And in the original, in the
book, it's Bruce Cockburn,

00:24:04.271 --> 00:24:06.020
but we couldn't get
the rights fast enough

00:24:06.020 --> 00:24:08.390
to get Bruce Cockburn's
name in there.

00:24:08.390 --> 00:24:10.216
But Neil said yes.

00:24:10.216 --> 00:24:11.840
And I like Neil, too,
just so you know.

00:24:14.540 --> 00:24:16.310
But that's how the
conversation starts.

00:24:16.310 --> 00:24:21.380
And Mackenzie goes and sits
down and doesn't touch anything,

00:24:21.380 --> 00:24:25.080
and they start a conversation.

00:24:25.080 --> 00:24:33.510
And at one point, Papa says
to Mackenzie, Mackenzie,

00:24:33.510 --> 00:24:37.110
the great flaw, the
fundamental flaw in your life,

00:24:37.110 --> 00:24:40.880
is that you don't
believe that I'm good.

00:24:40.880 --> 00:24:43.090
I am.

00:24:43.090 --> 00:24:46.480
And I'm at work in your
life for good in what

00:24:46.480 --> 00:24:48.950
you consider to be a mess.

00:24:48.950 --> 00:24:51.150
But until you believe
that I'm good,

00:24:51.150 --> 00:24:54.820
you're never going to
be able to trust me.

00:24:54.820 --> 00:24:57.430
And he looks at
her with this fury,

00:24:57.430 --> 00:25:02.080
and he smashes the plate
out in front of him.

00:25:02.080 --> 00:25:05.350
And he goes, why would
I ever trust you?

00:25:05.350 --> 00:25:08.050
My daughter is dead.

00:25:08.050 --> 00:25:09.000
Smash.

00:25:09.000 --> 00:25:10.630
And nothing you can
say will change it.

00:25:10.630 --> 00:25:12.680
Walk away.

00:25:12.680 --> 00:25:15.780
And we're like, [GASP].

00:25:15.780 --> 00:25:20.380
And I look over at Dwight and
Laurie, and they're in shock.

00:25:20.380 --> 00:25:22.670
And then we watch it again.

00:25:22.670 --> 00:25:24.490
And then we watch it again.

00:25:24.490 --> 00:25:25.900
Why would I ever trust you?

00:25:25.900 --> 00:25:27.250
My daughter is dead.

00:25:27.250 --> 00:25:30.800
Mackenzie, until you
believe that I'm good,

00:25:30.800 --> 00:25:32.920
you're never going to
be able to trust me--

00:25:32.920 --> 00:25:35.350
the fundamental
flaw in your life.

00:25:35.350 --> 00:25:37.600
Why would I ever trust you?

00:25:37.600 --> 00:25:39.000
My daughter is dead.

00:25:39.000 --> 00:25:40.500
And by the third
time through, we're

00:25:40.500 --> 00:25:45.950
bawling, because this is
right at the core of where

00:25:45.950 --> 00:25:48.780
Dwight and Laurie are stuck.

00:25:48.780 --> 00:25:53.040
Well, for two hours,
right, we're watching this.

00:25:53.040 --> 00:25:54.210
We take a break.

00:25:54.210 --> 00:25:58.560
Octavia comes over and
just hugs on everybody.

00:25:58.560 --> 00:26:01.060
So does Sumi and so does Aviv.

00:26:01.060 --> 00:26:02.780
Aviv plays Jesus.

00:26:02.780 --> 00:26:04.310
Aviv is a Jew.

00:26:04.310 --> 00:26:05.610
Can you imagine?

00:26:05.610 --> 00:26:08.580
A Jew playing Jesus?

00:26:08.580 --> 00:26:10.350
Who would have thought?

00:26:10.350 --> 00:26:11.700
You have to understand.

00:26:11.700 --> 00:26:15.289
I get emails from my people,
evangelical fundamentalists,

00:26:15.289 --> 00:26:16.830
and I've gotten at
least five of them

00:26:16.830 --> 00:26:19.693
go like, how dare you make
Jesus a Middle Easterner?

00:26:25.620 --> 00:26:29.190
What, you've only seen
him in the movies or what?

00:26:29.190 --> 00:26:30.570
I checked with the Jews--

00:26:30.570 --> 00:26:31.830
I mean, the Jewish consulate.

00:26:31.830 --> 00:26:32.530
They are Jews.

00:26:32.530 --> 00:26:34.940
They're Middle Easterners.

00:26:34.940 --> 00:26:38.770
But they come over and
they just love on us.

00:26:38.770 --> 00:26:42.390
Well, in the afternoon, we
sit down for the second shot.

00:26:42.390 --> 00:26:44.580
And it's the one where Papa
is talking to Mackenzie.

00:26:44.580 --> 00:26:46.440
Mackenzie is
sitting on the porch

00:26:46.440 --> 00:26:48.806
and they're talking
about a bird.

00:26:48.806 --> 00:26:50.180
And Papa says,
you know, pain has

00:26:50.180 --> 00:26:53.660
a way of clipping your
wings so that you forget

00:26:53.660 --> 00:26:55.250
you were ever created to fly.

00:26:55.250 --> 00:26:59.150
You're looking through this
little knothole of your loss

00:26:59.150 --> 00:27:01.910
and defining the whole universe.

00:27:01.910 --> 00:27:02.690
And we're gone.

00:27:02.690 --> 00:27:08.820
The first shot we're
just, like, toast.

00:27:08.820 --> 00:27:11.290
And it was two
more hours of that.

00:27:11.290 --> 00:27:14.620
At the end of that day,
we're hugging goodbye.

00:27:14.620 --> 00:27:17.404
And Laurie says,
you have no idea.

00:27:17.404 --> 00:27:18.070
And that's true.

00:27:18.070 --> 00:27:18.970
I don't.

00:27:18.970 --> 00:27:22.540
I don't know how the ripples
go and how the layers are.

00:27:22.540 --> 00:27:24.600
I don't know.

00:27:24.600 --> 00:27:26.640
But to be able to participate
in the holy ground

00:27:26.640 --> 00:27:27.765
of other people's stories--

00:27:31.240 --> 00:27:32.530
how incredible is that?

00:27:32.530 --> 00:27:35.720
And we all do it.

00:27:35.720 --> 00:27:40.120
We just don't spend enough time
staying present to realize it.

00:27:40.120 --> 00:27:41.680
Our choices actually matter.

00:27:41.680 --> 00:27:44.530
Our participation
actually matters.

00:27:44.530 --> 00:27:46.490
And that's just
one of the stories

00:27:46.490 --> 00:27:52.930
that just happened inside the
context of a movie being shot.

00:27:52.930 --> 00:27:56.660
The book has done it,
too, all over the world.

00:27:56.660 --> 00:27:58.730
I made 15 copies that
did everything I ever

00:27:58.730 --> 00:28:01.330
wanted it to do, and
it's the number two

00:28:01.330 --> 00:28:04.709
book in the history of Brazil.

00:28:04.709 --> 00:28:06.250
You know who my
distributor in Brazil

00:28:06.250 --> 00:28:07.720
is, my number one distributor?

00:28:07.720 --> 00:28:10.780
You would not believe
this, but you will.

00:28:10.780 --> 00:28:12.070
But it's just so--

00:28:12.070 --> 00:28:13.300
you wouldn't think of it.

00:28:13.300 --> 00:28:16.030
And that is, there's
no distribution system,

00:28:16.030 --> 00:28:20.270
and Brazil is the same size as
the continental United States.

00:28:20.270 --> 00:28:22.750
It's just that American
cartographers used

00:28:22.750 --> 00:28:24.280
to make all the
maps, so they always

00:28:24.280 --> 00:28:27.860
made America look the biggest.

00:28:27.860 --> 00:28:31.930
But the only reason the US
has more land area than Brazil

00:28:31.930 --> 00:28:33.970
is because of Alaska.

00:28:33.970 --> 00:28:37.240
But other than that,
it's the same size.

00:28:37.240 --> 00:28:40.390
They have no distribution
system, no mass delivery

00:28:40.390 --> 00:28:42.040
freight system on the ground.

00:28:42.040 --> 00:28:46.510
And my number one distributor,
who sold over 3 million copies

00:28:46.510 --> 00:28:48.130
by themselves, is Avon.

00:28:50.650 --> 00:28:55.486
Avon-- door-to-door
cosmetics and books.

00:28:55.486 --> 00:28:56.290
AUDIENCE: Crazy.

00:28:56.290 --> 00:28:58.030
WILLIAM PAUL YOUNG: It is crazy.

00:28:58.030 --> 00:29:00.382
And then Croatia
dubbed "The Shack"

00:29:00.382 --> 00:29:02.590
their book of the decade,
and the Ministry of Culture

00:29:02.590 --> 00:29:05.170
asked me almost
two years ago now

00:29:05.170 --> 00:29:06.870
to come speak to the country.

00:29:06.870 --> 00:29:07.840
And I did that.

00:29:07.840 --> 00:29:09.160
I was cleaning toilets.

00:29:09.160 --> 00:29:11.440
You understand how bizarre
this whole thing is?

00:29:11.440 --> 00:29:15.340
This is totally
God's sense of humor.

00:29:15.340 --> 00:29:20.140
And so it has been
an unanticipated

00:29:20.140 --> 00:29:26.620
and unprecedented, in a lot of
respects, adventure or journey,

00:29:26.620 --> 00:29:29.740
complete with its
own set of crosses.

00:29:29.740 --> 00:29:32.530
But it's been fantastic.

00:29:32.530 --> 00:29:34.309
I'm thrilled to be a part of it.

00:29:34.309 --> 00:29:36.850
Kim would tell you, and my kids
would tell you and my friends

00:29:36.850 --> 00:29:40.000
would tell you, that if all
this-- notoriety, platform,

00:29:40.000 --> 00:29:41.050
all this stuff--

00:29:41.050 --> 00:29:43.540
if it all went away
tomorrow, I'd be fine.

00:29:43.540 --> 00:29:44.690
I'd be great.

00:29:44.690 --> 00:29:47.320
I was great before this.

00:29:47.320 --> 00:29:50.680
I finally was comfortable
inside my own skin,

00:29:50.680 --> 00:29:52.180
and that took a lot of time.

00:29:52.180 --> 00:29:56.830
It took all of 50 years
to get to that place.

00:29:56.830 --> 00:29:58.910
So that's the big
bird's eye view.

00:29:58.910 --> 00:30:02.520
So your questions.

00:30:02.520 --> 00:30:05.359
And we'll just have a time
of question and response.

00:30:05.359 --> 00:30:07.150
I'm a Canadian, so I
don't have the answer.

00:30:07.150 --> 00:30:11.860
So I don't do Q&amp;A. I tell
them, if I was an American,

00:30:11.860 --> 00:30:18.740
I probably would do Q&amp;A. So
I do questions and response.

00:30:18.740 --> 00:30:21.490
Q&amp;A may be if I do
questions and apologies,

00:30:21.490 --> 00:30:25.279
because we're kind of famous
for being sorry about stuff.

00:30:25.279 --> 00:30:26.320
AUDIENCE: Good afternoon.

00:30:26.320 --> 00:30:26.920
How are you?

00:30:26.920 --> 00:30:27.640
WILLIAM PAUL YOUNG:
I'm very well.

00:30:27.640 --> 00:30:28.140
Thank you.

00:30:28.140 --> 00:30:29.810
AUDIENCE: Thanks
so much for coming.

00:30:29.810 --> 00:30:32.380
So I have kind of an unrelated
question to your book,

00:30:32.380 --> 00:30:34.480
but I know you mentioned
right at the get

00:30:34.480 --> 00:30:36.100
go, which really
caught my attention,

00:30:36.100 --> 00:30:38.027
that you've been
married for 38--

00:30:38.027 --> 00:30:40.110
WILLIAM PAUL YOUNG: It
will be 38 years this fall.

00:30:40.110 --> 00:30:40.930
AUDIENCE: 38 years.

00:30:40.930 --> 00:30:45.010
Can you just describe how did
you make that work in a culture

00:30:45.010 --> 00:30:46.510
that we live in that's just--

00:30:46.510 --> 00:30:49.900
I think the statistics
are showing at least 50%

00:30:49.900 --> 00:30:51.820
divorce rate in our country.

00:30:51.820 --> 00:30:53.530
I could be a little off on that.

00:30:53.530 --> 00:30:55.810
But could you just
talk about that?

00:30:55.810 --> 00:30:58.150
WILLIAM PAUL YOUNG: Yeah.

00:30:58.150 --> 00:31:03.550
That is not an easy
short answer response.

00:31:03.550 --> 00:31:07.000
So one, I married
the wrath of God.

00:31:14.290 --> 00:31:16.990
I now believe the wrath
of God is the love of God.

00:31:16.990 --> 00:31:20.620
But you've got to understand,
kim is from North Dakota.

00:31:20.620 --> 00:31:23.770
She was born in
Minot, and her family

00:31:23.770 --> 00:31:25.870
migrated west-- big family.

00:31:25.870 --> 00:31:28.240
She has five sisters
and two brothers.

00:31:28.240 --> 00:31:32.040
Her and her five sisters
are called "the force,"

00:31:32.040 --> 00:31:34.990
and may the force be with you.

00:31:34.990 --> 00:31:40.990
So these folks,
Minnesota, North Dakota--

00:31:40.990 --> 00:31:43.080
I mean, there is no
fifty shades of nothing.

00:31:43.080 --> 00:31:46.510
It's either this or that.

00:31:46.510 --> 00:31:48.160
But I grew up in a
religious family,

00:31:48.160 --> 00:31:50.770
so we hid everything,
lied about most stuff,

00:31:50.770 --> 00:31:54.220
had to have an Order of
Service when we got together.

00:31:54.220 --> 00:31:56.100
Her family is just out there.

00:31:56.100 --> 00:31:58.870
Me, I got all these
survival mechanisms

00:31:58.870 --> 00:32:02.500
from my abuse histories,
so I'm all hyper vigilant

00:32:02.500 --> 00:32:06.790
and know how to shade
the truth in 5,000 ways.

00:32:06.790 --> 00:32:12.610
And at the same time, I'm
desperate for some healing

00:32:12.610 --> 00:32:14.950
in my own heart.

00:32:14.950 --> 00:32:17.469
But I wanted God to heal me
without anybody else finding

00:32:17.469 --> 00:32:18.010
out about it.

00:32:27.660 --> 00:32:30.660
And frankly, I didn't marry
Kim because I loved her.

00:32:30.660 --> 00:32:32.700
Because at that
point in my life,

00:32:32.700 --> 00:32:35.400
I didn't know how
to love anyone.

00:32:35.400 --> 00:32:38.940
I had no love for myself,
because I believed

00:32:38.940 --> 00:32:41.550
all the theology about
being a piece of crap

00:32:41.550 --> 00:32:45.165
that I grew up with and
about the nature of God

00:32:45.165 --> 00:32:46.830
as different than Jesus--

00:32:46.830 --> 00:32:50.040
all that kind of stuff.

00:32:50.040 --> 00:32:53.220
But it turns out I'm smart
and creative, which actually

00:32:53.220 --> 00:32:56.100
was an inhibitor to healing.

00:32:56.100 --> 00:32:57.480
It empowered me to hide.

00:33:00.030 --> 00:33:04.260
And so I hid.

00:33:04.260 --> 00:33:08.650
I married Kim because I thought
I got the nudge from God

00:33:08.650 --> 00:33:11.760
to do that.

00:33:11.760 --> 00:33:15.210
I'm forever grateful
because she saved my life.

00:33:18.340 --> 00:33:22.870
Now, at the point where all of
my facade, all of my hiddenness

00:33:22.870 --> 00:33:24.220
was exposed--

00:33:24.220 --> 00:33:27.400
and I now believe that
exposure is a gift,

00:33:27.400 --> 00:33:30.670
but it's a severe mercy--

00:33:30.670 --> 00:33:37.810
when that happened,
I blew it all up.

00:33:37.810 --> 00:33:40.060
I blew my whole world up.

00:33:40.060 --> 00:33:44.330
And that's what started my
11-year dismantling/rebuilding

00:33:44.330 --> 00:33:44.830
process.

00:33:49.210 --> 00:33:53.940
And it was the
intensity of Kim's fury

00:33:53.940 --> 00:33:58.260
that pushed me to deal with
all the darkness in my heart.

00:33:58.260 --> 00:34:01.750
And so how did we make it work?

00:34:01.750 --> 00:34:07.680
One is when it all blew
up, I hit the bottom enough

00:34:07.680 --> 00:34:10.670
to own what I'd done--

00:34:10.670 --> 00:34:11.435
no more secrets.

00:34:14.940 --> 00:34:19.429
So when I got to 50, which is
at the end of that 11 years--

00:34:19.429 --> 00:34:23.949
it was 38 to the
year I turned 50.

00:34:23.949 --> 00:34:26.440
When I got there, I
was finally at a place

00:34:26.440 --> 00:34:30.310
where no secrets, no addictions,
and I was the same person

00:34:30.310 --> 00:34:31.270
in every situation.

00:34:34.500 --> 00:34:39.400
And there was reconciliation
in the midst of all the damage.

00:34:39.400 --> 00:34:41.610
So what I say is
Kim saved my life

00:34:41.610 --> 00:34:45.639
and paid a high price
for it, and she does not

00:34:45.639 --> 00:34:52.980
regret the high price but
it's totally not fair.

00:34:52.980 --> 00:34:54.610
It's grace.

00:34:54.610 --> 00:34:59.000
So part of it was
if I had deviated

00:34:59.000 --> 00:35:02.540
from dealing with my
stuff when I got exposed,

00:35:02.540 --> 00:35:03.545
we wouldn't be together.

00:35:03.545 --> 00:35:04.670
It would not have happened.

00:35:07.220 --> 00:35:10.160
But her intensity is what
kept me dealing with it,

00:35:10.160 --> 00:35:13.970
at the same time
as my desperation.

00:35:13.970 --> 00:35:17.420
So I think that
one of the things

00:35:17.420 --> 00:35:19.670
I understand about
marriage-- and you remember

00:35:19.670 --> 00:35:23.370
when Jesus is talking
to the Pharisees

00:35:23.370 --> 00:35:25.120
because they're all
griping about the fact

00:35:25.120 --> 00:35:27.990
that his disciples are
violating Sabbath law?

00:35:27.990 --> 00:35:30.930
They're going, eating stuff
on the Sabbath, picking corn,

00:35:30.930 --> 00:35:32.380
working--

00:35:32.380 --> 00:35:34.990
all the rules, all
the religious rules.

00:35:34.990 --> 00:35:37.930
And Jesus says this
one line that just

00:35:37.930 --> 00:35:39.980
changes the entire universe.

00:35:39.980 --> 00:35:43.540
He says, don't you
realize that the Sabbath

00:35:43.540 --> 00:35:45.370
was made for the
human being, not

00:35:45.370 --> 00:35:48.130
the human being for Sabbath?

00:35:48.130 --> 00:35:53.300
Well, put in that
marriage, that marriage

00:35:53.300 --> 00:35:56.330
was made for the human
being, not the human being

00:35:56.330 --> 00:35:57.800
for marriage.

00:35:57.800 --> 00:36:00.170
And that begins to
change everything.

00:36:00.170 --> 00:36:03.770
That means that
marriage is defined

00:36:03.770 --> 00:36:06.860
as an outward expression of
the uniqueness of the two

00:36:06.860 --> 00:36:09.990
individuals involved in it.

00:36:09.990 --> 00:36:14.700
There is no external law of
the Sabbath, law of marriage,

00:36:14.700 --> 00:36:19.000
that defines what that's
supposed to look like for you.

00:36:19.000 --> 00:36:21.450
And that's what the Church,
frankly, has been good at.

00:36:21.450 --> 00:36:24.570
We come up with all kinds of
Sabbath laws or marriage laws

00:36:24.570 --> 00:36:26.190
or expectations.

00:36:26.190 --> 00:36:28.560
And as soon as something goes--

00:36:28.560 --> 00:36:32.670
suddenly the man who's supposed
to do this can't anymore--

00:36:32.670 --> 00:36:35.760
or whatever, whatever
the rules are.

00:36:35.760 --> 00:36:36.510
No.

00:36:36.510 --> 00:36:42.240
So part of it is to recognize
that marriage is something

00:36:42.240 --> 00:36:45.540
that you have to figure
out with the person

00:36:45.540 --> 00:36:47.100
that you are in a
relationship to,

00:36:47.100 --> 00:36:50.160
and it involves mystery
and a loss of control.

00:36:50.160 --> 00:36:52.340
Any relationship does.

00:36:52.340 --> 00:36:53.180
Ask any married man.

00:36:57.230 --> 00:37:00.630
And the thing about it is
that person is not static.

00:37:00.630 --> 00:37:02.000
They don't stay still.

00:37:02.000 --> 00:37:03.440
They keep growing, too.

00:37:03.440 --> 00:37:06.090
So this mystery that
you then move into

00:37:06.090 --> 00:37:08.660
is an ever-expanding universe.

00:37:08.660 --> 00:37:10.880
And in the middle of that,
I was with Richard Rohr.

00:37:10.880 --> 00:37:12.338
I don't know if
you know who he is.

00:37:12.338 --> 00:37:14.330
So I did a conference
on the Trinity

00:37:14.330 --> 00:37:15.800
with him a couple of months ago.

00:37:15.800 --> 00:37:21.650
And so we were driving
along in his car.

00:37:21.650 --> 00:37:25.790
He's a Franciscan
celibate monk--

00:37:25.790 --> 00:37:29.780
vow of poverty, chastity,
and something else.

00:37:29.780 --> 00:37:33.030
And he says, Paul--

00:37:33.030 --> 00:37:35.360
and he's a Kansas City
farm boy who didn't ever

00:37:35.360 --> 00:37:38.699
expect to be involved
with writing the things

00:37:38.699 --> 00:37:39.240
that he does.

00:37:39.240 --> 00:37:41.390
And he says, you know what?

00:37:41.390 --> 00:37:44.840
This sounds weird coming from
a celibate Franciscan monk,

00:37:44.840 --> 00:37:49.010
but I'm convinced that marriage
is the greatest gift that God

00:37:49.010 --> 00:37:51.920
has given humanity,
as a crucible

00:37:51.920 --> 00:37:55.130
in which transformation
becomes a possibility.

00:37:58.770 --> 00:38:01.890
So part of the
integrity of marriage

00:38:01.890 --> 00:38:06.710
is that we commit ourselves
to the transformation

00:38:06.710 --> 00:38:09.950
of our own hearts and
recognize that this is a gift.

00:38:09.950 --> 00:38:13.010
So the difference is
that each person then

00:38:13.010 --> 00:38:16.070
becomes part of the
catalyst for change,

00:38:16.070 --> 00:38:19.220
but it's going to bring all
your crap to the surface.

00:38:19.220 --> 00:38:29.470
And we live in a world where
fear of missing out or 2.2

00:38:29.470 --> 00:38:33.220
becomes more attractive than
having to work through dealing

00:38:33.220 --> 00:38:35.800
with our own crap.

00:38:35.800 --> 00:38:40.240
And so that's part of the
problem that we're in.

00:38:40.240 --> 00:38:41.950
We don't know how
to make a commitment

00:38:41.950 --> 00:38:44.470
and stick with it when
it gets really hard,

00:38:44.470 --> 00:38:47.770
and it does get really hard.

00:38:47.770 --> 00:38:53.350
So those are parts of a
response to your question.

00:38:53.350 --> 00:38:56.290
I mean, I could spend the
whole day talking to you

00:38:56.290 --> 00:38:59.320
about some of that.

00:38:59.320 --> 00:39:04.082
And then at this point,
don't make choices based

00:39:04.082 --> 00:39:05.290
on what the culture is doing.

00:39:08.040 --> 00:39:11.950
If you work through the
stuff of your marriage,

00:39:11.950 --> 00:39:16.380
it will become attractive
to those who watch it.

00:39:16.380 --> 00:39:18.540
That's not the
reason why you do it.

00:39:18.540 --> 00:39:20.040
You do it because
you want to become

00:39:20.040 --> 00:39:21.300
an authentic human being.

00:39:21.300 --> 00:39:23.550
That's why you do it.

00:39:23.550 --> 00:39:29.340
And this is a gift, as severe
a mercy as it is sometimes.

00:39:29.340 --> 00:39:33.750
13 years after I
blew my world up--

00:39:33.750 --> 00:39:37.020
I got a one-sentence phone call
on January 4, '94, from Kim.

00:39:37.020 --> 00:39:39.540
And all she said was, I'm
waiting for you at your office

00:39:39.540 --> 00:39:41.420
and I know.

00:39:41.420 --> 00:39:44.110
And what she knew was I was in
a three-month affair with one

00:39:44.110 --> 00:39:47.680
of her best friends, and that
was after our sixth child had

00:39:47.680 --> 00:39:49.660
been born.

00:39:49.660 --> 00:39:52.850
So I mean, I blew up the world.

00:39:52.850 --> 00:39:57.776
I broke-- I broke the world.

00:39:57.776 --> 00:39:58.276
Yeah.

00:40:01.494 --> 00:40:03.910
And at that point, I had to
decide whether to kill myself.

00:40:03.910 --> 00:40:09.160
Suicide has always been
a relative, a companion,

00:40:09.160 --> 00:40:11.985
because it's the last way to
run away before you actually

00:40:11.985 --> 00:40:12.610
hit the bottom.

00:40:15.160 --> 00:40:17.310
Or face her.

00:40:17.310 --> 00:40:22.640
And I still don't know
how I made it across town.

00:40:25.280 --> 00:40:26.360
I mean, I went into--

00:40:26.360 --> 00:40:28.100
I pulled the Yellow
Pages off the shelf,

00:40:28.100 --> 00:40:34.026
and we can go into so many
mysterious graces that

00:40:34.026 --> 00:40:35.150
were in the middle of this.

00:40:35.150 --> 00:40:37.850
I pull the Yellow
Pages off the shelf

00:40:37.850 --> 00:40:41.750
and end up sitting in front of
a total stranger who becomes

00:40:41.750 --> 00:40:44.180
a friend and a therapist.

00:40:44.180 --> 00:40:45.290
And that was part of it.

00:40:45.290 --> 00:40:47.540
Kim didn't demand that.

00:40:47.540 --> 00:40:51.010
For the first time in
my life I needed help.

00:40:51.010 --> 00:40:53.980
I wish I had
acknowledged it before.

00:40:53.980 --> 00:40:58.500
But some of us are so broken,
we have to get caught.

00:40:58.500 --> 00:41:01.620
And 13 years later,
we're sitting in a group.

00:41:01.620 --> 00:41:04.830
Because we never made my
adultery the new secret.

00:41:04.830 --> 00:41:08.220
And we're sitting in a group of
friends, all who knew my story.

00:41:08.220 --> 00:41:11.370
And Kim says to them
in front of me--

00:41:11.370 --> 00:41:16.910
she says, you know, I never
thought I would ever say this.

00:41:16.910 --> 00:41:19.736
It was all worth it.

00:41:19.736 --> 00:41:22.850
And she's not
justifying adultery.

00:41:22.850 --> 00:41:27.300
She's not saying the means
justify the ends or the ends

00:41:27.300 --> 00:41:28.350
justify the means.

00:41:28.350 --> 00:41:33.517
She's saying, there's nothing so
broken that God can't heal it,

00:41:33.517 --> 00:41:35.100
or so lost that God
doesn't know where

00:41:35.100 --> 00:41:41.580
it is, or so dead that God
can't grow something in it.

00:41:41.580 --> 00:41:44.870
And she was saying,
he's worth it.

00:41:44.870 --> 00:41:47.050
AUDIENCE: What a lovely story.

00:41:47.050 --> 00:41:48.580
That was so great.

00:41:48.580 --> 00:41:51.250
WILLIAM PAUL YOUNG: Well, you
asked the question, darling.

00:41:51.250 --> 00:41:53.860
But it's the way it is.

00:41:53.860 --> 00:41:57.310
So to be involved on this side,
in the ripple effect of all

00:41:57.310 --> 00:42:01.970
this, it's an incredible grace.

00:42:01.970 --> 00:42:03.959
I'm very grateful.

00:42:03.959 --> 00:42:04.500
AUDIENCE: Hi.

00:42:04.500 --> 00:42:08.260
I recently read "Lies
We Believe About God."

00:42:08.260 --> 00:42:09.800
I felt like I was
having difficulty

00:42:09.800 --> 00:42:11.330
understanding your position.

00:42:11.330 --> 00:42:13.370
Because while you
include many proof texts

00:42:13.370 --> 00:42:16.760
for a universal
salvation of man,

00:42:16.760 --> 00:42:19.385
there was no address of the many
verses that suggest otherwise.

00:42:19.385 --> 00:42:20.884
WILLIAM PAUL YOUNG:
Did you not read

00:42:20.884 --> 00:42:22.104
the [? catina ?] at the back?

00:42:22.104 --> 00:42:22.770
AUDIENCE: I did.

00:42:22.770 --> 00:42:27.450
Yeah, those all seemed to
be proof texts for, right?

00:42:27.450 --> 00:42:29.450
WILLIAM PAUL YOUNG: Well,
they were just a list.

00:42:29.450 --> 00:42:30.630
AUDIENCE: Yeah, it was
just a list of verses,

00:42:30.630 --> 00:42:32.450
but I wanted to see
verses that seemed

00:42:32.450 --> 00:42:34.760
to suggest against the
universal salvation of man.

00:42:34.760 --> 00:42:37.560
I wanted to hear what you
had to say about those.

00:42:37.560 --> 00:42:39.200
I have one verse
I'd like to read--

00:42:39.200 --> 00:42:40.824
or, well, two verses
I'd like to read--

00:42:40.824 --> 00:42:43.820
and then I'd like to ask
a clarifying question.

00:42:43.820 --> 00:42:47.150
Revelation 20: 9-10 say,
"And they marched up

00:42:47.150 --> 00:42:48.950
over the broad
plain of the earth

00:42:48.950 --> 00:42:52.430
and surrounded the camp of the
saints and the beloved city,

00:42:52.430 --> 00:42:54.830
but fire came down from
heaven and consumed them.

00:42:54.830 --> 00:42:56.630
And the devil who
had deceived them

00:42:56.630 --> 00:42:59.420
was thrown into the
lake of fire and sulfur,

00:42:59.420 --> 00:43:01.310
where the beast and
the false prophet were.

00:43:01.310 --> 00:43:04.140
And they will be tormented day
and night, forever and ever."

00:43:04.140 --> 00:43:05.859
So the clarifying
question is, do you

00:43:05.859 --> 00:43:07.400
believe that, in
addition to mankind,

00:43:07.400 --> 00:43:10.760
that also the devils
are redeemed, forgiven,

00:43:10.760 --> 00:43:13.436
and spared eternal punishment?

00:43:17.330 --> 00:43:21.850
WILLIAM PAUL YOUNG: Well,
you couched your question

00:43:21.850 --> 00:43:23.680
with an assumption that's false.

00:43:23.680 --> 00:43:24.970
AUDIENCE: OK, sure.

00:43:24.970 --> 00:43:27.220
WILLIAM PAUL YOUNG: So the
first part of your question

00:43:27.220 --> 00:43:28.764
was, do you also believe that?

00:43:28.764 --> 00:43:30.430
And then you made a
statement about what

00:43:30.430 --> 00:43:31.716
I believe about everybody.

00:43:31.716 --> 00:43:33.715
AUDIENCE: That's why it's
a clarifying question.

00:43:33.715 --> 00:43:34.275
Thanks.

00:43:34.275 --> 00:43:35.650
WILLIAM PAUL YOUNG:
So let's talk

00:43:35.650 --> 00:43:38.110
about universal
salvation for a second.

00:43:38.110 --> 00:43:40.570
That's a very different
thing than the idea

00:43:40.570 --> 00:43:43.330
that everyone will ultimately
be reconciled back face

00:43:43.330 --> 00:43:45.550
to face with the Father,
Son, and Holy Spirit.

00:43:45.550 --> 00:43:47.070
Do you understand
the distinction?

00:43:47.070 --> 00:43:48.820
AUDIENCE: I do understand
the distinction,

00:43:48.820 --> 00:43:53.937
but I understood the
former from the book.

00:43:53.937 --> 00:43:55.020
But go ahead and continue.

00:43:55.020 --> 00:43:57.610
WILLIAM PAUL YOUNG: No, I went
to great pains to say, no,

00:43:57.610 --> 00:43:59.640
I don't know.

00:43:59.640 --> 00:44:03.410
Here's a question that
I'd like to ask back.

00:44:03.410 --> 00:44:08.220
If God, in God's wisdom and
counsel within the Father, Son,

00:44:08.220 --> 00:44:11.450
and Holy Spirit, from
prior to creation,

00:44:11.450 --> 00:44:15.170
knew how to win every
single part of creation

00:44:15.170 --> 00:44:20.312
back and redeem it, would
you be opposed to it?

00:44:20.312 --> 00:44:21.770
AUDIENCE: Would I
be opposed to it?

00:44:21.770 --> 00:44:22.880
WILLIAM PAUL YOUNG: Yeah.

00:44:22.880 --> 00:44:25.992
AUDIENCE: I am for
whatever God is for.

00:44:25.992 --> 00:44:28.200
WILLIAM PAUL YOUNG: So you
wouldn't be opposed to it?

00:44:28.200 --> 00:44:30.722
AUDIENCE: I'd have to think
more about what you're saying.

00:44:30.722 --> 00:44:33.180
WILLIAM PAUL YOUNG: Well, I'm
saying I'm not opposed to it.

00:44:33.180 --> 00:44:36.450
Actually, I hope that that's
true, but I don't know.

00:44:36.450 --> 00:44:40.860
So I'm not holding to a doctrine
of universal reconciliation.

00:44:40.860 --> 00:44:43.410
But universal salvation,
that goes all the way back

00:44:43.410 --> 00:44:46.980
to the early Church, as far
as saying that what Jesus did

00:44:46.980 --> 00:44:49.920
affected every
single human being

00:44:49.920 --> 00:44:54.810
on the planet who
would ever exist.

00:44:54.810 --> 00:44:56.820
He died once for all.

00:44:56.820 --> 00:44:59.460
This is a statement that is true
and worthy of full acceptance

00:44:59.460 --> 00:45:02.610
that Jesus Christ is the
savior of all mankind.

00:45:02.610 --> 00:45:05.130
If I be lifted up, I'll
drag all men to myself.

00:45:05.130 --> 00:45:07.530
That word is only used
for dragging the fish that

00:45:07.530 --> 00:45:11.490
were breaking the nets, Paul and
Silas in front of the council,

00:45:11.490 --> 00:45:12.780
and in that verse.

00:45:12.780 --> 00:45:19.290
So the majority statement
throughout Christian history

00:45:19.290 --> 00:45:25.360
has been that universal
salvation exists for everyone,

00:45:25.360 --> 00:45:26.430
and it was accomplished.

00:45:26.430 --> 00:45:28.610
It was finished in Christ.

00:45:28.610 --> 00:45:31.520
The question is, do
you want it or not?

00:45:31.520 --> 00:45:36.680
Because your choice continues
to matter in an ongoing sense.

00:45:36.680 --> 00:45:39.020
So relationship is
always contingent.

00:45:39.020 --> 00:45:44.485
Relationship is always about
your ability to choose.

00:45:44.485 --> 00:45:45.440
We have six children.

00:45:45.440 --> 00:45:48.240
If one of my children--

00:45:48.240 --> 00:45:51.060
say our oldest son, say Chad--

00:45:51.060 --> 00:45:53.430
decides that he never
wants to talk to me again,

00:45:53.430 --> 00:45:56.060
wants to change his name,
whatever, ontologically he's

00:45:56.060 --> 00:45:56.850
still my son.

00:45:56.850 --> 00:46:00.700
But it completely
affects the relationship

00:46:00.700 --> 00:46:01.990
in an ongoing sense.

00:46:01.990 --> 00:46:06.010
Because part of
relationship is that I

00:46:06.010 --> 00:46:08.590
respect the choices that he
makes as a human being to say

00:46:08.590 --> 00:46:10.150
no.

00:46:10.150 --> 00:46:12.630
Well, that impacts relationship.

00:46:12.630 --> 00:46:15.570
Does it ontologically
make him not my son?

00:46:15.570 --> 00:46:16.710
No.

00:46:16.710 --> 00:46:19.290
And we're saying--
and I say "we"--

00:46:21.910 --> 00:46:24.820
the tradition of the
Church historically

00:46:24.820 --> 00:46:27.730
is that ontologically,
our salvation

00:46:27.730 --> 00:46:31.630
is accomplished in Christ, yet
we still have to work it out.

00:46:31.630 --> 00:46:34.330
What he has already worked
in, we got to work it out.

00:46:34.330 --> 00:46:36.140
Our choices actually matter.

00:46:36.140 --> 00:46:37.630
You can participate or not.

00:46:37.630 --> 00:46:40.750
Potentially, you can
say no to this forever.

00:46:40.750 --> 00:46:44.400
But part of my belief
is, my opinion is,

00:46:44.400 --> 00:46:46.780
is that love will
never stop pursuing,

00:46:46.780 --> 00:46:49.330
and death is not
what defines things.

00:46:49.330 --> 00:46:52.360
It is God who is life
who defines everything.

00:46:52.360 --> 00:46:53.890
That's a whole
different question

00:46:53.890 --> 00:46:57.974
than the issue of looking at
Revelation, that whole passage.

00:46:57.974 --> 00:46:59.140
Are we dealing with symbols?

00:46:59.140 --> 00:47:00.340
What do those symbols mean?

00:47:00.340 --> 00:47:01.774
What's it talking about?

00:47:01.774 --> 00:47:03.940
AUDIENCE: I wasn't so much
asking about the passage,

00:47:03.940 --> 00:47:04.690
just reading it.

00:47:04.690 --> 00:47:07.960
And then this question
comes up of devils.

00:47:11.200 --> 00:47:13.060
You say in the book
that death does not

00:47:13.060 --> 00:47:14.426
stop someone's free will.

00:47:14.426 --> 00:47:15.800
They can continue
to choose that.

00:47:15.800 --> 00:47:16.841
WILLIAM PAUL YOUNG: Yeah.

00:47:16.841 --> 00:47:19.750
The potential is that everything
is restored-- potentially,

00:47:19.750 --> 00:47:22.270
because it depends on
how you define fire.

00:47:22.270 --> 00:47:24.760
When I say I married the
wrath of God, which I believe

00:47:24.760 --> 00:47:27.520
is the love of God,
I'm making a statement

00:47:27.520 --> 00:47:29.470
about the nature of fire.

00:47:29.470 --> 00:47:32.890
And that's a huge conversation.

00:47:32.890 --> 00:47:37.150
If you want to explore it
more, because I don't want

00:47:37.150 --> 00:47:42.500
to get stuck in a
mind conversation,

00:47:42.500 --> 00:47:44.950
scriptural, proof
texting conversation

00:47:44.950 --> 00:47:47.500
at the moment, because we just
don't have the time for it--

00:47:47.500 --> 00:47:50.800
but read Brad Jersak's
"Her Gates Will Never Be

00:47:50.800 --> 00:47:53.650
Shut," which is a reference
to that very passage

00:47:53.650 --> 00:47:54.970
in Revelation.

00:47:54.970 --> 00:47:57.580
But it's one of the best
explorations about this.

00:47:57.580 --> 00:48:00.010
My opinion is that the fire--

00:48:00.010 --> 00:48:03.020
God is fire, and
I believe in fire.

00:48:03.020 --> 00:48:04.390
In fact, I count on it.

00:48:04.390 --> 00:48:07.540
Like George MacDonald says, "If
you trust the goodness of God,

00:48:07.540 --> 00:48:09.520
you will run to him with
your arms wide open,

00:48:09.520 --> 00:48:11.944
and you will say, please,
judge me to the core

00:48:11.944 --> 00:48:13.360
and burn out of
me everything that

00:48:13.360 --> 00:48:16.180
keeps me from being fully
human and fully alive."

00:48:16.180 --> 00:48:18.400
But I believe that the
furious fire of God

00:48:18.400 --> 00:48:21.250
is always for us,
not against us,

00:48:21.250 --> 00:48:25.750
but is always against everything
that is not of love's kind,

00:48:25.750 --> 00:48:28.720
that God will not stand
idly by while anything

00:48:28.720 --> 00:48:31.960
that is not of love's
kind remains unchallenged.

00:48:31.960 --> 00:48:35.980
So that's the statement that
I would categorically say.

00:48:35.980 --> 00:48:41.050
So again, for the sake of
time and this conversation,

00:48:41.050 --> 00:48:43.697
we can pick that up, but
check out Brad's book.

00:48:43.697 --> 00:48:44.530
AUDIENCE: Thank you.

00:48:44.530 --> 00:48:46.570
WILLIAM PAUL YOUNG: Thank you.

00:48:46.570 --> 00:48:47.430
AUDIENCE: Thank you.

00:48:47.430 --> 00:48:48.820
Great to see you again, Paul.

00:48:48.820 --> 00:48:51.910
So during this
11-year process, what

00:48:51.910 --> 00:48:53.740
was the key moment
in there that led you

00:48:53.740 --> 00:48:57.550
to this new view of God,
to view God as relational,

00:48:57.550 --> 00:49:01.180
to view God as this community
of persons, Father, Son,

00:49:01.180 --> 00:49:02.050
and Spirit?

00:49:02.050 --> 00:49:02.880
WILLIAM PAUL YOUNG: Yeah, the
key moment was getting caught.

00:49:02.880 --> 00:49:05.213
AUDIENCE: So many Christians
have no conception of that,

00:49:05.213 --> 00:49:09.340
so what triggered that?

00:49:09.340 --> 00:49:12.385
WILLIAM PAUL YOUNG:
Well, that is a process.

00:49:15.250 --> 00:49:19.570
You have to have the lies
exposed that underlie, that

00:49:19.570 --> 00:49:23.720
bring the disconnect and the
incoherence to your life.

00:49:23.720 --> 00:49:26.950
And so it happened in
many, many different ways.

00:49:26.950 --> 00:49:31.180
It happened through opening
my world up to relationships,

00:49:31.180 --> 00:49:35.620
not just with Kim and our
kids but with friends.

00:49:35.620 --> 00:49:39.880
And it had to do with
beginning to question some

00:49:39.880 --> 00:49:43.476
of the fundamental tenets that
I grew up with-- the nature

00:49:43.476 --> 00:49:44.350
and character of God.

00:49:44.350 --> 00:49:46.000
Is God good all the time?

00:49:46.000 --> 00:49:47.979
Is this a love that is
for me or against me?

00:49:47.979 --> 00:49:50.020
Is there a difference in
the nature and character

00:49:50.020 --> 00:49:51.280
of the Father and the Son?

00:49:51.280 --> 00:49:53.550
What do I do with
some of the atonement

00:49:53.550 --> 00:49:55.480
there is that we're
not taught as theories

00:49:55.480 --> 00:49:57.130
when I was growing up?

00:49:57.130 --> 00:50:00.580
So that reinforced
this separation

00:50:00.580 --> 00:50:05.184
and fear construct,
all of those things.

00:50:05.184 --> 00:50:06.850
And then beginning
to realize that there

00:50:06.850 --> 00:50:10.900
is nothing deeper as I
journeyed into the questions

00:50:10.900 --> 00:50:14.590
about the Trinity, which
I had been since I was 18.

00:50:14.590 --> 00:50:17.800
I mean, my journey
started with questions.

00:50:17.800 --> 00:50:19.660
In fact, my journey
into the Trinity

00:50:19.660 --> 00:50:23.300
came from the issue of women,
because most of the damage

00:50:23.300 --> 00:50:24.806
in my life came from men.

00:50:24.806 --> 00:50:26.180
And as I looked
around the world,

00:50:26.180 --> 00:50:28.576
most of the damage in
the world comes from men.

00:50:28.576 --> 00:50:30.950
And as I looked in scripture,
through one man sin entered

00:50:30.950 --> 00:50:33.290
the world, all the brokenness.

00:50:33.290 --> 00:50:36.620
And so I'm going, if men are so
much more messed up than women,

00:50:36.620 --> 00:50:39.080
how come they're in charge--

00:50:39.080 --> 00:50:43.070
because of my evangelical,
hierarchical fundamentalism.

00:50:43.070 --> 00:50:45.252
That drove me into
the Trinity, going,

00:50:45.252 --> 00:50:47.085
if there's hierarchy
in human relationships,

00:50:47.085 --> 00:50:49.910
there's got to be a
hierarchy in the Trinity.

00:50:49.910 --> 00:50:51.410
And if you've done
any study at all,

00:50:51.410 --> 00:50:54.810
you know that any version
of hierarchy in the Trinity

00:50:54.810 --> 00:50:57.330
has been declared heresy
by every single Christian

00:50:57.330 --> 00:51:01.217
tradition historically,
without exception.

00:51:01.217 --> 00:51:03.300
The eternal subordination
of the Son or the Father

00:51:03.300 --> 00:51:05.070
is heresy, et cetera.

00:51:05.070 --> 00:51:08.490
So if there is no hierarchy
within that circle

00:51:08.490 --> 00:51:11.130
of relationship and
we're created in it,

00:51:11.130 --> 00:51:12.870
that begins to
change everything.

00:51:12.870 --> 00:51:15.870
So not only was it relational
stuff that was happening.

00:51:15.870 --> 00:51:20.250
It was also the reading of some
of the early Church fathers,

00:51:20.250 --> 00:51:23.160
some of the theologians
through the centuries,

00:51:23.160 --> 00:51:25.920
as well as the impact
of art, the impact

00:51:25.920 --> 00:51:27.570
of music, the impact
of these things

00:51:27.570 --> 00:51:32.690
that penetrated past all my
ways of hiding inside my head.

00:51:32.690 --> 00:51:37.870
Then having children
had a huge impact

00:51:37.870 --> 00:51:40.030
on moving me out of my head.

00:51:40.030 --> 00:51:42.340
So there's all these
incremental little things.

00:51:42.340 --> 00:51:44.560
During that 11
years, a lot of it

00:51:44.560 --> 00:51:46.420
was just in
conversation, whether it

00:51:46.420 --> 00:51:49.420
was dealing with my own
stuff therapeutically

00:51:49.420 --> 00:51:54.190
or beginning to realize how
relationships had damaged me

00:51:54.190 --> 00:51:56.860
and how it was relationships
that were bringing me back

00:51:56.860 --> 00:51:59.770
to wholeness and
then driving that

00:51:59.770 --> 00:52:03.280
into my understanding of the
relationship of the Father,

00:52:03.280 --> 00:52:04.255
Son, and Holy Spirit.

00:52:04.255 --> 00:52:06.682
The Trinity is very
central for me,

00:52:06.682 --> 00:52:08.140
because I don't
think apart from it

00:52:08.140 --> 00:52:11.470
you have a basis anywhere
for love and relationship.

00:52:11.470 --> 00:52:16.137
There has to be other-centered
self-givingness to an other,

00:52:16.137 --> 00:52:17.470
and that has to be always there.

00:52:17.470 --> 00:52:20.056
So that all just began to
expand and trickle out.

00:52:20.056 --> 00:52:21.764
AUDIENCE: One thing
is, the subordination

00:52:21.764 --> 00:52:23.347
of the Son to the
Father is back again

00:52:23.347 --> 00:52:25.690
as a major topic of
discussion right now.

00:52:25.690 --> 00:52:28.170
WILLIAM PAUL YOUNG: I know,
but we tend to do that.

00:52:28.170 --> 00:52:30.704
Hard to leave old habits.

00:52:30.704 --> 00:52:32.995
SPEAKER 1: Yeah, and I actually
had a question for you.

00:52:32.995 --> 00:52:35.536
You mentioned "The Shack" did
everything you wanted it to do.

00:52:35.536 --> 00:52:38.170
It went out to those
dozen people there.

00:52:38.170 --> 00:52:41.774
But now that it has gone out
to millions around the world,

00:52:41.774 --> 00:52:43.690
is there anything you
would want to change now

00:52:43.690 --> 00:52:45.112
that it is larger?

00:52:45.112 --> 00:52:46.070
WILLIAM PAUL YOUNG: No.

00:52:46.070 --> 00:52:50.740
There is a really
glaring mistake in it,

00:52:50.740 --> 00:52:54.250
but I don't want to change it
because I like talking about it

00:52:54.250 --> 00:52:58.210
as a mistake so that people
don't make something out of it

00:52:58.210 --> 00:53:00.137
that it isn't.

00:53:00.137 --> 00:53:02.470
There is a scene when McKenzie
goes back into the shack.

00:53:02.470 --> 00:53:05.410
And it's not in the movie, but
I talked to them about this.

00:53:05.410 --> 00:53:07.750
And they did shoot it this
way, but it didn't make it

00:53:07.750 --> 00:53:10.087
through the editing process.

00:53:10.087 --> 00:53:11.920
When Mackenzie goes
back into the shack that

00:53:11.920 --> 00:53:16.000
has been transformed,
which is the presence

00:53:16.000 --> 00:53:18.220
of God declaring
the truth of who

00:53:18.220 --> 00:53:21.940
he is, even if he
can't recognize it

00:53:21.940 --> 00:53:25.480
except for this broken down
place where he's stuck.

00:53:25.480 --> 00:53:28.460
He goes in and he looks to where
Missy's blood stain should be,

00:53:28.460 --> 00:53:30.130
and it's gone.

00:53:30.130 --> 00:53:34.180
I think that's a mistake,
that it should still be there.

00:53:34.180 --> 00:53:40.750
Now, just because you work
through the arduous nature

00:53:40.750 --> 00:53:43.090
of your own damage doesn't
mean that the evidence of it

00:53:43.090 --> 00:53:44.770
just disappears.

00:53:44.770 --> 00:53:46.910
There are still nail scars.

00:53:46.910 --> 00:53:49.120
And one of the beautiful
things in the movie

00:53:49.120 --> 00:53:51.290
is that those nail scars exist.

00:53:51.290 --> 00:53:53.110
They're on Papa, which
is like the book,

00:53:53.110 --> 00:53:56.380
and same with Sarayu, the
Holy Spirit, and on Jesus.

00:53:56.380 --> 00:53:59.230
And that comes from,
where was God the Father?

00:53:59.230 --> 00:54:01.450
For God was in Christ
reconciling the world

00:54:01.450 --> 00:54:02.500
to himself.

00:54:02.500 --> 00:54:07.330
And that's a theme that we
could talk about theologically.

00:54:07.330 --> 00:54:13.120
But having the blood stain there
is a declaration of something

00:54:13.120 --> 00:54:15.040
that I think is
really significant,

00:54:15.040 --> 00:54:20.400
and that is, the
question that is

00:54:20.400 --> 00:54:26.190
behind my wrestling with
this mistake is that--

00:54:26.190 --> 00:54:29.090
who originates the cross?

00:54:29.090 --> 00:54:30.230
The scars are still there.

00:54:30.230 --> 00:54:32.090
Who originates the cross?

00:54:32.090 --> 00:54:34.820
And I don't think the
cross originates in God,

00:54:34.820 --> 00:54:37.400
because God is light and in God
there is no darkness at all.

00:54:37.400 --> 00:54:39.650
And there's nothing light
about a torture device

00:54:39.650 --> 00:54:40.940
called a cross.

00:54:40.940 --> 00:54:42.875
And historically, we
know who invented it

00:54:42.875 --> 00:54:44.000
and all this kind of stuff.

00:54:44.000 --> 00:54:47.330
But its only existence is
to keep a human being alive

00:54:47.330 --> 00:54:49.460
as long as possible and in
as much pain as possible

00:54:49.460 --> 00:54:51.980
and then forcibly extract
their breath from them.

00:54:51.980 --> 00:54:54.600
That's the purpose of it.

00:54:54.600 --> 00:55:00.950
So how does God then dismantle
this iconic statement

00:55:00.950 --> 00:55:02.840
of a fist in the face of God?

00:55:02.840 --> 00:55:05.780
Because it is the
symbol of iniquity,

00:55:05.780 --> 00:55:10.370
that we would do this to even a
human being, while God destroys

00:55:10.370 --> 00:55:12.470
its power by submitting to it--

00:55:12.470 --> 00:55:15.800
which is just beyond
our comprehension,

00:55:15.800 --> 00:55:18.950
that God comes and submits
to us as a baby who grows up

00:55:18.950 --> 00:55:20.900
and then climbs on
to our torture device

00:55:20.900 --> 00:55:23.120
in order to destroy its power.

00:55:23.120 --> 00:55:25.670
He destroys the power of
death that is represented

00:55:25.670 --> 00:55:27.380
by this torture device.

00:55:27.380 --> 00:55:28.790
But here's the beauty.

00:55:28.790 --> 00:55:31.280
He not only destroys
it by submitting to it,

00:55:31.280 --> 00:55:34.310
but transforms it into an icon
and a monument of grace that

00:55:34.310 --> 00:55:36.800
has become precious
to us, that we'll wear

00:55:36.800 --> 00:55:39.260
on our rings and our jewelry.

00:55:39.260 --> 00:55:41.180
Because he's changed that.

00:55:41.180 --> 00:55:43.430
That tells me that
there is no darkness

00:55:43.430 --> 00:55:45.740
that I can bring to the
table that God can't

00:55:45.740 --> 00:55:47.630
climb into the middle
of and transform

00:55:47.630 --> 00:55:50.890
into an icon and a
monument of grace.

00:55:50.890 --> 00:55:52.770
And so I can look
at my life and go,

00:55:52.770 --> 00:55:56.740
OK, I'm not alone, because I'm
created in the image of a God

00:55:56.740 --> 00:55:58.480
who has never been alone.

00:55:58.480 --> 00:56:01.850
And I'm created in the
middle of that relationship.

00:56:01.850 --> 00:56:05.090
And this God is with me
in order to co-create

00:56:05.090 --> 00:56:07.940
with my participation, because
God won't heal us apart

00:56:07.940 --> 00:56:12.140
from our participation,
something that is living.

00:56:12.140 --> 00:56:14.720
And He will transform
the mess that

00:56:14.720 --> 00:56:18.860
is my life into an icon
and a monument to grace.

00:56:18.860 --> 00:56:21.234
So that's one of those things.

00:56:21.234 --> 00:56:23.150
There are lots of things
that you could change

00:56:23.150 --> 00:56:27.234
that could be said better.

00:56:27.234 --> 00:56:28.400
SPEAKER 1: That's well done.

00:56:28.400 --> 00:56:30.230
So we have time for
one quick question.

00:56:30.230 --> 00:56:34.405
Is there anyone that has
a one-minute request?

00:56:38.200 --> 00:56:42.070
AUDIENCE: Can you tell us
about how Papa was inspired?

00:56:42.070 --> 00:56:44.360
WILLIAM PAUL YOUNG: Yeah, Papa.

00:56:44.360 --> 00:56:46.580
Papa God, large, black
African-American woman.

00:56:46.580 --> 00:56:49.250
And just so you know,
a lot of my people

00:56:49.250 --> 00:56:53.612
had a problem with
that, like my mom.

00:56:53.612 --> 00:56:55.820
My mom tried to read the
book, and the first time she

00:56:55.820 --> 00:56:57.361
tried to read it,
she closed the book

00:56:57.361 --> 00:56:59.500
when God the Father
came through the door

00:56:59.500 --> 00:57:02.120
as a large, black,
African-American woman.

00:57:02.120 --> 00:57:04.560
That's why Octavia
Spencer plays Papa.

00:57:07.265 --> 00:57:08.747
And she called my
sister and said,

00:57:08.747 --> 00:57:09.830
your brother is a heretic.

00:57:09.830 --> 00:57:11.990
So it's not like I
haven't heard it.

00:57:14.670 --> 00:57:20.220
God is traditionally-- and
this is classic theology--

00:57:20.220 --> 00:57:23.970
that God is not more male and
female, that all of maternity

00:57:23.970 --> 00:57:26.820
and all of paternity originate
in the Father and in the Son

00:57:26.820 --> 00:57:28.530
and in the Holy Spirit.

00:57:28.530 --> 00:57:32.940
And the metaphor and
everything else, the imagery,

00:57:32.940 --> 00:57:35.850
is littered through scripture,
and it's in the language.

00:57:35.850 --> 00:57:38.800
But a lot of times it's
been masked over by the fact

00:57:38.800 --> 00:57:45.660
that we haven't allowed that
perspective, because men

00:57:45.660 --> 00:57:47.312
have largely translated
the scriptures.

00:57:47.312 --> 00:57:49.770
Even when you're introduced to
the Holy Spirit in verse two

00:57:49.770 --> 00:57:51.700
in Genesis, it's all feminine.

00:57:51.700 --> 00:57:53.970
Ruach is feminine, the
verbs are feminine,

00:57:53.970 --> 00:57:55.900
pronouns are feminine.

00:57:55.900 --> 00:57:59.520
And the word "mercy" comes from
the same root as the Hebrew

00:57:59.520 --> 00:58:03.360
word for "womb," so every time
you read mercy or compassion,

00:58:03.360 --> 00:58:05.100
you're dealing with womb love.

00:58:05.100 --> 00:58:08.760
When Nicodemus
says, how does a man

00:58:08.760 --> 00:58:13.510
climb into his mother's
womb, that word is used--

00:58:13.510 --> 00:58:17.880
Luke loves that word, talking
about when John the Baptist

00:58:17.880 --> 00:58:19.470
leaped in his mother's womb.

00:58:19.470 --> 00:58:24.030
The word is kopon, and
it's used when John 1:18--

00:58:24.030 --> 00:58:28.230
it says that no one
has seen God face

00:58:28.230 --> 00:58:30.540
to face except the
begotten one who

00:58:30.540 --> 00:58:36.530
has been hidden in the kopon of
the Father, the Father's womb.

00:58:36.530 --> 00:58:40.060
But it's translated "bosom,"
because God the Father can't

00:58:40.060 --> 00:58:41.760
have a womb.

00:58:41.760 --> 00:58:45.570
But again, imagery was never
intended to define God.

00:58:45.570 --> 00:58:47.930
It was intended to help us
understand the character

00:58:47.930 --> 00:58:48.800
and nature of God.

00:58:48.800 --> 00:58:51.390
So God is a burning bush
or a rock or a fortress

00:58:51.390 --> 00:58:53.220
or a strong tower
or a mother bear

00:58:53.220 --> 00:58:56.580
or a woman who loses a coin
or a nursing mother in Isaiah

00:58:56.580 --> 00:59:00.150
or an old man in Ezekiel or
on and on and on and on--

00:59:00.150 --> 00:59:02.160
imagery.

00:59:02.160 --> 00:59:06.000
And imagery is to help
us understand facets

00:59:06.000 --> 00:59:07.950
of the character
and nature of God,

00:59:07.950 --> 00:59:12.660
not to declare the gender
of God or an isolated,

00:59:12.660 --> 00:59:15.240
specific element of the
character and nature of God

00:59:15.240 --> 00:59:17.280
and then make that idolatry.

00:59:17.280 --> 00:59:20.190
So when I wrote
this for my kids,

00:59:20.190 --> 00:59:24.360
I did not want the
revelation of God

00:59:24.360 --> 00:59:28.050
to be inside the
white Western box.

00:59:28.050 --> 00:59:31.920
So the only white Western guy
in the storyline is Mackenzie.

00:59:31.920 --> 00:59:34.170
That's me.

00:59:34.170 --> 00:59:38.040
And I want the character
and nature of God

00:59:38.040 --> 00:59:39.810
to be much bigger than that.

00:59:39.810 --> 00:59:42.400
So the Holy Spirit
is an Asian woman.

00:59:42.400 --> 00:59:46.470
Sophia that comes right out
of Proverbs, Chapter 8--

00:59:46.470 --> 00:59:48.510
"sophia" is the Greek
word for "wisdom"--

00:59:48.510 --> 00:59:53.580
so wisdom personified was played
by Alice Braga from Brazil,

00:59:53.580 --> 00:59:55.350
but is Hispanic.

00:59:55.350 --> 00:59:58.910
And so you've got African,
you've got Hispanic,

00:59:58.910 --> 01:00:00.720
and Jesus, Middle Eastern.

01:00:00.720 --> 01:00:03.390
And so it was
like, no, we've got

01:00:03.390 --> 01:00:05.010
to get outside this white box.

01:00:05.010 --> 01:00:07.440
And all I'm trying to do is
write a story for my kids

01:00:07.440 --> 01:00:13.910
to say, let's not
put God in this box.

01:00:13.910 --> 01:00:18.530
And let that then
begin to help us

01:00:18.530 --> 01:00:22.190
with our understanding of the
character and nature of God.

01:00:22.190 --> 01:00:24.740
So it's a violation
for a lot of us

01:00:24.740 --> 01:00:26.570
because it violates
our paradigms, not

01:00:26.570 --> 01:00:29.270
because it violates scripture.

01:00:29.270 --> 01:00:33.080
It's just that we're used
to thinking a certain way.

01:00:33.080 --> 01:00:36.470
And you know that
understanding has

01:00:36.470 --> 01:00:39.550
to come from changes
of perspective.

01:00:39.550 --> 01:00:40.827
That's how it happens.

01:00:40.827 --> 01:00:42.910
Whether you're dealing
with math or whether you're

01:00:42.910 --> 01:00:48.350
dealing with
psychology or theology,

01:00:48.350 --> 01:00:50.830
you've got to change
your perspective.

01:00:50.830 --> 01:00:53.140
And that's why-- it's in "Eve"--

01:00:53.140 --> 01:00:58.370
I wrote, one good question
is worth a thousand answers,

01:00:58.370 --> 01:01:00.550
because we need to
talk about these things

01:01:00.550 --> 01:01:02.410
and look at our
perspectives and where

01:01:02.410 --> 01:01:03.910
we've got our boxes
that are inside

01:01:03.910 --> 01:01:06.950
our heads that keep us divided
one from another, for one

01:01:06.950 --> 01:01:08.850
thing.

01:01:08.850 --> 01:01:09.350
Good.

01:01:09.350 --> 01:01:10.990
Thank you so much.

01:01:10.990 --> 01:01:13.090
It's been an honor to be here.

01:01:13.090 --> 01:01:16.440
[APPLAUSE]
