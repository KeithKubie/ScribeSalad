00:00:06.160 --> 00:00:35.900
[Nostalgia Critic Opening]

00:00:35.900 --> 00:00:39.280
[soft music plays]

00:00:43.900 --> 00:00:44.600
Little Girl: Wow!

00:00:44.600 --> 00:00:48.680
So this is where all the Nostalgia Critic 
episodes were filmed years ago!

00:00:48.880 --> 00:00:50.520
Aunt Despair: You got it, bucko.

00:00:50.760 --> 00:00:54.020
They kept everything the same to preserve its history.

00:00:54.020 --> 00:00:55.940
Look at all the reviews that they did.

00:00:56.180 --> 00:00:57.420
There's Shrek.

00:00:57.540 --> 00:01:00.580
There's Schindler's List Saves Christmas.

00:01:01.880 --> 00:01:03.080
...And that one.

00:01:03.460 --> 00:01:07.560
But this, this is what I really wanted to show you.

00:01:10.240 --> 00:01:13.140
Little Girl: Is that the DVD from the Balto review, Aunt Despair?

00:01:13.220 --> 00:01:15.280
Aunt Despair: Yep. And I was there when it was shot.

00:01:15.400 --> 00:01:16.040
Little Girl: *Gasp!*

00:01:16.040 --> 00:01:17.520
You mean it's a true story?

00:01:17.620 --> 00:01:20.520
Aunt Despair: Based. It's based on a true story.

00:01:20.600 --> 00:01:23.220
Little Girl: Wow! Would you mind telling me the tale, Aunt Despair?

00:01:23.240 --> 00:01:26.400
Aunt: After I have a sip of my storytelling sauce.

00:01:26.400 --> 00:01:29.420
Girl: Oh, the same sauce that makes you 
good at slo-mo leapfrog with men?

00:01:29.420 --> 00:01:33.880
Aunt: Our story begins on the Nostalgia Critic 
sitting down at the desk he normally does.

00:01:34.400 --> 00:01:38.480
NC: Hello, I'm the Nostalgia Critic.
I remember it so you don't have to.

00:01:38.780 --> 00:01:41.540
Let's talk about a little film called "Balto".

00:01:41.540 --> 00:01:47.280
(Calming guitar music plays)

00:01:47.460 --> 00:01:50.260
Despite it doing poorly with both critics and box office,

00:01:50.260 --> 00:01:52.540
the film eventually found success on home video,

00:01:52.540 --> 00:01:55.440
leading to a ton of VHS and DVD sales.

00:01:55.440 --> 00:01:59.700
So, I guess it got the reputation of the 
not really little film that not really could

00:01:59.700 --> 00:02:01.500
but turned in a profit eventually anyway, so..

00:02:01.500 --> 00:02:03.220
Table scrap sequels for all!

00:02:03.220 --> 00:02:05.980
Based on a true story, it covers a dog sled that has to

00:02:05.980 --> 00:02:09.440
race against time to get medicine to a town full of dying children.

00:02:09.660 --> 00:02:15.460
Even though it's gathered a nostalgic following, we should still ask "does the film really hold up years later?"

00:02:15.640 --> 00:02:19.720
Whether it does or doesn't, we're not gonna get any movies about heroic cat sleds, are we?

00:02:19.800 --> 00:02:21.760
Deranged Cat: Hey! I resent that!

00:02:21.780 --> 00:02:24.300
[Laughs]

00:02:25.580 --> 00:02:26.280
Cat: HAA!

00:02:26.280 --> 00:02:27.480
Little Girl: Wait a minute! Wait a minute.

00:02:27.600 --> 00:02:29.420
There's talking animals in this?

00:02:29.840 --> 00:02:30.660
Aunt Despair:Sure, why not?

00:02:30.660 --> 00:02:32.280
Girl:I thought you said this was a true story?

00:02:32.280 --> 00:02:33.880
Aunt:Based...based.

00:02:33.880 --> 00:02:36.460
Girl: Did you just hallucinate that there were talking animals?

00:02:36.460 --> 00:02:37.500
Aunt: It's possible.

00:02:37.500 --> 00:02:41.440
I just added nicotine patches to my 
daily smoking, so I'm feeling a little queasy.

00:02:41.440 --> 00:02:42.480
I'm gonna lay down.

00:02:42.480 --> 00:02:43.780
Girl: But what about the story?

00:02:43.920 --> 00:02:44.620
Aunt: Okay.

00:02:44.620 --> 00:02:48.160
Are you gonna shut up or are you gonna 
keep being little Miss Youtube Comments?

00:02:48.300 --> 00:02:49.420
Girl: Okay. I'm sorry.

00:02:49.580 --> 00:02:50.360
Aunt: That's better.

00:02:50.360 --> 00:02:51.780
[coughs loudly]

00:02:51.960 --> 00:02:53.240
That's a good high.

00:02:53.240 --> 00:02:55.480
Anyways, the Critic started his review...

00:02:56.100 --> 00:02:58.880
NC: Let's take a look at Balto.

00:02:59.600 --> 00:03:02.400
So, this animated story about a dog racing across Alaska

00:03:02.400 --> 00:03:05.340
opens with live action people in the middle of New York.

00:03:05.440 --> 00:03:09.480
You sure we didn't put on 
Professor Sprout Visits the Muggleverse?

00:03:09.680 --> 00:03:12.340
A woman and her grandchild
are looking for a memorial site

00:03:12.340 --> 00:03:17.040
as she decides to force the kid to sit on a bench 
for an hour and a half while she tells the story.

00:03:17.080 --> 00:03:21.260
Movie grandma:"In the cold winter of 1925..."

00:03:22.140 --> 00:03:23.980
"It was snowing hard."

00:03:24.040 --> 00:03:25.920
NC: "Things were animated back then."

00:03:25.920 --> 00:03:29.060
"I dare even say, with a Spielberg vibe."

00:03:29.460 --> 00:03:31.540
We see Alaska's portrayal of "Ben Fur".

00:03:31.680 --> 00:03:33.380
[crowd booing]

00:03:33.660 --> 00:03:38.140
As we're introduced to our half wolf, 
half dog hybrid: Balto. Played by Kevin Bacon.

00:03:38.140 --> 00:03:40.040
He's also joined by a goose played by

00:03:40.040 --> 00:03:44.060
I think Bob Hoskins's drunken rants 
from the Super Mario Bros. movie.

00:03:44.060 --> 00:03:47.540
"When will you learn to stay on the sidelines!?"

00:03:47.580 --> 00:03:50.640
Aw, it's his best Russian accent since
 Enemy at the Gates.

00:03:50.900 --> 00:03:53.340
"Stalingrad."

00:03:53.740 --> 00:03:56.700
They're watching a sled race led by a dog named Steele,

00:03:56.760 --> 00:04:02.440
who is so mean that literally every frame is
determined to convince you he's pure evil.

00:04:02.620 --> 00:04:04.400
"Get out of here, wolf-dog."

00:04:04.400 --> 00:04:05.940
"You better get back to your pack."

00:04:05.940 --> 00:04:09.560
"Well, maybe your taste runs more toward wolf..."

00:04:09.560 --> 00:04:11.560
"Jenna, join me for dinner..."

00:04:11.580 --> 00:04:17.780
I've never seen a bad guy where every second he's moving in some sort of obviously diabolical manner.

00:04:18.140 --> 00:04:20.900
"You were the fastest...what?"

00:04:21.080 --> 00:04:21.640
"Oh..."

00:04:21.640 --> 00:04:22.800
[bones cracking]

00:04:23.120 --> 00:04:26.160
"Most villains have some normal everyday movements,

00:04:26.160 --> 00:04:28.800
but 24-7 this guy is like:

00:04:28.800 --> 00:04:30.640
"Would you like some ice cream?"

00:04:30.640 --> 00:04:32.140
"You can trust me!"

00:04:32.140 --> 00:04:35.440
"I'm oozing with pleasantness!"

00:04:35.880 --> 00:04:39.120
Every angle is evil except for maybe this one that...

00:04:39.280 --> 00:04:41.280
that looks like a girl's t-shirt from an Anime Con.

00:04:41.280 --> 00:04:44.340
But look at this, even when he's turning around
 he looks evil!

00:04:44.420 --> 00:04:46.960
"I'm sorry, Balto. Balto the halfbreed."

00:04:46.960 --> 00:04:48.500
[jeering]

00:04:48.500 --> 00:04:50.760
"Oh, you want me to turn around? Okay!"

00:04:50.760 --> 00:04:52.220
"Yaaaahahaha!"

00:04:52.320 --> 00:04:54.540
"Oh, you want me to do it again?"

00:04:54.740 --> 00:04:57.120
Everybody mocks Balto for being a hybrid.

00:04:57.120 --> 00:04:59.600
The humans are afraid of him 
and the dogs think he's an outcast

00:04:59.600 --> 00:05:02.320
leading to probably the film's most poignant line.

00:05:02.320 --> 00:05:04.460
"Not a dog. Not a wolf."

00:05:04.500 --> 00:05:07.560
"All he knows is what he is not."

00:05:08.480 --> 00:05:10.240
Wow, that was actually pretty heavy.

00:05:10.240 --> 00:05:12.380
How are you gonna follow 
something as complex as that up?

00:05:12.520 --> 00:05:14.960
[clicking and squeaking]

00:05:18.920 --> 00:05:20.140
So, that just happened.

00:05:21.260 --> 00:05:23.140
Oh, there's also Bob Hoskins doing the goose step.

00:05:23.140 --> 00:05:23.640
"Hey!"

00:05:26.180 --> 00:05:26.680
"Hey!"

00:05:27.780 --> 00:05:31.680
So at this point, you're probably wondering 
where does the comedy in this kid's film lie

00:05:31.680 --> 00:05:33.580
particularly with the goose?

00:05:33.660 --> 00:05:37.060
Is this Lego Batman good or are we in Nut Job territory?

00:05:37.360 --> 00:05:39.140
Well, let's look at the chart.

00:05:39.360 --> 00:05:42.680
Nostalgia Critic: Yes...yes...
Damn it! Just annoying enough!

00:05:42.720 --> 00:05:44.960
They've entered the Sinbad Zone!

00:05:45.380 --> 00:05:49.000
Oh, there's also these...I think polar bears

00:05:49.000 --> 00:05:52.380
though they look more like moogles if they ate Chien-po.

00:05:52.380 --> 00:05:55.100
And to possibly make things worse, 
they're voiced by Phil Collins.

00:05:55.180 --> 00:05:56.840
"We love you, Uncle Boris!"

00:05:56.840 --> 00:05:57.900
Oh, christ!

00:05:58.780 --> 00:05:59.560
Not a musical.

00:05:59.560 --> 00:06:01.580
Oh, you are a kind movie.

00:06:01.880 --> 00:06:06.140
So, while having fun at beautiful o' clock 
and presumably striking a trailer pose,

00:06:06.160 --> 00:06:07.700
Let me see here...yep!

00:06:07.700 --> 00:06:09.740
That's some compressed enchantment.

00:06:09.820 --> 00:06:11.900
Bad news seems to be rolling in.

00:06:11.900 --> 00:06:12.620
[clicking and beeping]

00:06:12.700 --> 00:06:17.740
Nostalgia Critic: "Movie lagging. Need story. 
Send disease. Preferably child-killing."

00:06:18.060 --> 00:06:18.840
[ding]

00:06:18.840 --> 00:06:19.800
There ya go!

00:06:19.800 --> 00:06:25.020
A horrible epidemic seems to be sweeping the town as Rosie, the woman telling the story shown here as a kid,

00:06:25.020 --> 00:06:28.660
is being comforted by her dog, Jenna, 
played by Bridget Fonda.

00:06:28.660 --> 00:06:29.780
[coughs]

00:06:29.780 --> 00:06:32.420
"Rosie! Come on, you're gonna catch 
your death out here."

00:06:32.540 --> 00:06:36.160
Nostalgia Critic: "Come and catch it inside, 
it's a stronger visual for younger viewers."

00:06:36.380 --> 00:06:37.260
Jenna: "Hi."

00:06:37.380 --> 00:06:38.080
"Hi."

00:06:38.220 --> 00:06:39.520
"Rosie's in there."

00:06:39.520 --> 00:06:41.100
"In a hospital? Why?"

00:06:41.100 --> 00:06:45.460
Balto, of course, has the hots for Jenna but 
she's too distracted by what'll happen to Rosie.

00:06:45.600 --> 00:06:47.300
"I know how to find out, come on."

00:06:50.360 --> 00:06:52.160
Based on a true story.

00:06:52.340 --> 00:06:55.080
If your dog can't do that, he's stupid.

00:06:55.260 --> 00:06:56.920
Doctor: "Looks like diphtheria."

00:06:56.920 --> 00:06:59.420
"And I'm out of antitoxin..."

00:06:59.420 --> 00:07:00.660
Balto: [whispers] "Jenna!"

00:07:00.660 --> 00:07:01.760
"Jenna, I'm sorry!"

00:07:01.760 --> 00:07:03.620
Nostalgia Critic: "You know 
I'm voiced by Kevin Bacon, right?"

00:07:03.620 --> 00:07:07.700
"And I like eating bacon. 
So that's like...two degrees of me?"

00:07:08.000 --> 00:07:12.800
Thus a dog sled race will be done to determine 
which dogs will go out to get the medicine.

00:07:13.100 --> 00:07:16.260
...Which you'd think they've figured out 
from the races they just had.

00:07:16.320 --> 00:07:18.060
Time's a factor here, guys.

00:07:18.260 --> 00:07:20.900
Of course, though, Balto enters himself in.

00:07:21.020 --> 00:07:24.540
"Do you honestly think any Musher 
would ever put you on his team?"

00:07:25.000 --> 00:07:26.540
"You're even more mixed up than I thought."

00:07:26.540 --> 00:07:30.680
HA! Joke's on you. Years from now they're going
to name a Shaquille O Neal movie after you!

00:07:30.740 --> 00:07:34.480
"--as long as the medicine gets through. 
Stop being such a glory hound!"

00:07:34.480 --> 00:07:38.740
"You're a hundred percent right, Jenna. I-I... 
I wasn't thinking about those children."

00:07:38.940 --> 00:07:40.160
Nostalgia Critic: Good Lord!

00:07:40.160 --> 00:07:44.100
It's like his face has ten different personalities 
and they all eat children!

00:07:44.160 --> 00:07:46.320
"I'm gonna fold you five ways...

00:07:46.340 --> 00:07:49.300
and leave you for a cat toy!"

00:07:49.300 --> 00:07:51.720
"Then you'll be a part of awkward punchlines like THIS!"

00:07:51.880 --> 00:07:52.920
[squeaking]

00:07:54.480 --> 00:07:55.860
"SHAAAME!"

00:07:56.300 --> 00:08:02.260
So, while Indiana Jones starts his winter vacation, the dog sled, led by Steele, travels through the snow to get the medicine.

00:08:02.500 --> 00:08:03.520
[train whistle blows]

00:08:03.520 --> 00:08:06.420
Nostalgia Critic: "This is the Polar 'Not-Goin-Anywhere'!"

00:08:06.420 --> 00:08:09.500
"Please hand over your one-way ticket to diphtheria."

00:08:09.940 --> 00:08:13.540
"Maybe we should go back! We're lost!"

00:08:13.600 --> 00:08:15.900
"I am not lost!"

00:08:15.900 --> 00:08:18.600
Yeah, you know, dogs really are the worst with directions.

00:08:18.600 --> 00:08:20.560
It's like when I let my dog drive.

00:08:20.900 --> 00:08:23.360
Alright, just back out nice and smooth.

00:08:24.460 --> 00:08:25.540
[loud explosion]

00:08:25.700 --> 00:08:28.240
Wait a minute! He let a dog drive?

00:08:28.580 --> 00:08:29.300
I guess.

00:08:29.340 --> 00:08:32.220
This true story of yours doesn't 
seem to make very much sense.

00:08:32.240 --> 00:08:33.620
Why would anybody let a dog drive?

00:08:33.620 --> 00:08:35.480
Shouldn't it be the human who's doing the driving?

00:08:35.480 --> 00:08:40.260
Look, I'm telling this story to a kid, of course, I'm gonna take some creative liberties because I think you're dumb.

00:08:40.280 --> 00:08:42.620
How much of your story is actually true?

00:08:42.620 --> 00:08:44.500
The Critic continues his review,
-Oh, my god.

00:08:44.500 --> 00:08:46.860
talking about when one of the dogs gets the bad news.

00:08:47.080 --> 00:08:48.980
[barking]

00:08:50.960 --> 00:08:54.720
"It's terrible, my friends. Just terrible."

00:08:54.800 --> 00:08:56.640
"I speak bark."

00:08:56.780 --> 00:09:00.400
"Which I thought we were all speaking, 
but apparently not."

00:09:00.640 --> 00:09:02.900
It looks like the sled is missing in the storm.

00:09:02.940 --> 00:09:05.840
Well, okay. 
I'm sure a slight delay won't be a major issue--

00:09:05.840 --> 00:09:07.180
OH GOD!!

00:09:07.260 --> 00:09:08.940
Sh*t's getting real man!

00:09:09.040 --> 00:09:13.940
I'm just assuming the other coffins are for Tiny Tim, Little Match Girl and Full Metal Alchemist spoiler!

00:09:13.940 --> 00:09:17.080
Don't act like that can't happen! 
There's dogs in this world!

00:09:17.360 --> 00:09:21.300
Sugar-fried Jesus, what do you 
follow a scene like that up with?

00:09:21.320 --> 00:09:24.100
"When you are big frozen stiff statue named Balto,"

00:09:24.100 --> 00:09:24.820
Nostalgia Critic: Oh, yes.

00:09:24.820 --> 00:09:30.100
The comedy stylings of characters you'd much rather eat than listen to. This seems totally appropriate now.

00:09:30.160 --> 00:09:32.880
"I am beginning to understand the bear!"

00:09:32.940 --> 00:09:34.040
[clapping]

00:09:34.040 --> 00:09:35.880
Oh, what a shame this isn't a musical.

00:09:35.880 --> 00:09:40.460
Could you see Phil Collins obnoxiously explaining in song what doesn't need to be explained?

00:09:40.620 --> 00:09:41.180
[music]

00:10:01.720 --> 00:10:02.820
[sniffs]

00:10:06.480 --> 00:10:08.260
"I smell boyfriend material."

00:10:08.400 --> 00:10:09.440
"Balto..."

00:10:09.580 --> 00:10:13.080
Jenna figures out Balto's going to 
find the sled and deliver the medicine.

00:10:13.120 --> 00:10:15.800
He marks his trail by scratching the trees because a...

00:10:16.000 --> 00:10:19.380
dog and wolf's sense of smell would just get him lost.

00:10:19.480 --> 00:10:21.780
as we see Stelle's gang is in big trouble.

00:10:21.820 --> 00:10:23.680
[screaming]

00:10:26.180 --> 00:10:27.620
Nostalgia Critic: "I call it! Let's eat him!"

00:10:27.620 --> 00:10:30.400
"Come on, you act like you 
never ate human flesh before!"

00:10:30.660 --> 00:10:34.720
But our heroes come across the biggest threat in animated movies: a bear!

00:10:34.760 --> 00:10:35.860
[roaring]

00:10:36.800 --> 00:10:37.660
Nooo!

00:10:37.660 --> 00:10:40.440
Don't you know they ruin animated films now?

00:10:40.460 --> 00:10:43.200
Open Season, Brother Bear, Brave, Norm of the North,

00:10:43.200 --> 00:10:45.940
Their destruction knows no rewrites!

00:10:46.360 --> 00:10:51.300
Speaking of which, even as black bears go, 
that is a pretty damn black bear!

00:10:51.360 --> 00:10:55.920
Did he bathe in ink after swimming 
through oil from a lake in Sin City?

00:10:56.060 --> 00:10:58.020
He's so black, his blood is coffee!

00:10:58.740 --> 00:11:01.740
But Jenna saves the day as 
they lead the bear into the ice.

00:11:02.480 --> 00:11:04.380
[loud splashing]

00:11:05.060 --> 00:11:09.240
Nostalgia Critic: "That's right! Return to your home planet, whatever species you were supposed to be!"

00:11:09.380 --> 00:11:10.600
Muk: "Jeronimo!"

00:11:12.640 --> 00:11:16.160
Nostalgia Critic: There ya go! 
Go save him, polar bears rather than fight the...

00:11:16.560 --> 00:11:19.680
other bear that you should technically be bigger than.

00:11:19.680 --> 00:11:23.540
Is this like when Pluto's on a leash but 
Goofy can walk around, we just don't question it?

00:11:24.000 --> 00:11:30.700
But Jenna damages her leg, so the comic "relief" take her back while Balto moves forward, eventually meeting up with the sled.

00:11:30.900 --> 00:11:32.440
"I'll get us back!"

00:11:32.460 --> 00:11:35.520
"I'm the lead dog! I'm in charge!

00:11:35.740 --> 00:11:37.600
"Two bones says Steele takes him."

00:11:37.600 --> 00:11:38.520
"Heh. You're on."

00:11:38.520 --> 00:11:41.560
Gambling dogs, this must be 
Michael Vick's favorite scene.

00:11:41.560 --> 00:11:43.180
Phew! Had to blow the dust off that one.

00:11:44.840 --> 00:11:48.880
But Steele wants the glory, so he fights Balto
 despite him not fighting back.

00:11:49.060 --> 00:11:53.720
Thank God kid's films favor passivism, 
because Steele falls off a cliff mid ass beating.

00:11:54.700 --> 00:11:55.380
Dead.

00:11:55.520 --> 00:11:56.020
Dead.

00:11:56.180 --> 00:11:56.680
Dead.

00:11:56.820 --> 00:11:57.320
Dead.

00:11:57.620 --> 00:11:58.120
Dead.

00:11:58.520 --> 00:12:00.140
Dead, dead dead.

00:12:00.760 --> 00:12:02.720
Oh, I mean totally alive.

00:12:02.940 --> 00:12:08.920
But even with Balto leading the way, Steele still manages to stop the medicine from getting to dying kids.

00:12:09.120 --> 00:12:10.560
"Go ahead wolf-dog!"

00:12:11.060 --> 00:12:12.340
"You'll never get home!"

00:12:12.640 --> 00:12:13.820
"How about over here!?"

00:12:13.820 --> 00:12:14.940
[scraping]

00:12:14.940 --> 00:12:16.380
"Whoops! Wrong way!"

00:12:16.760 --> 00:12:20.040
Holy sh*t! What is wrong with this character!?

00:12:20.120 --> 00:12:23.480
This is a village of kids that are going to die!

00:12:23.560 --> 00:12:26.160
Bad dog! BAD DOG!

00:12:26.300 --> 00:12:27.340
"I'll show em."

00:12:27.780 --> 00:12:32.080
"I'm also gonna create three new 
cancers as soon as I get home!"

00:12:32.740 --> 00:12:36.740
So Balto, as well, loses his way 
but is determined to move forward...

00:12:37.160 --> 00:12:38.140
...right off a cliff.

00:12:38.540 --> 00:12:40.360
[yelling]

00:12:42.680 --> 00:12:45.120
Well, it's all okay now--oh, spoke too soon.

00:12:45.120 --> 00:12:45.620
"Look out!"

00:12:47.440 --> 00:12:49.000
Well, it's all okay now--

00:12:49.000 --> 00:12:50.080
Oh, good Lord!

00:12:51.620 --> 00:12:54.060
Gravity was nicer to its main character!

00:12:54.220 --> 00:12:56.760
Both the movie and the concept!

00:12:57.100 --> 00:12:58.380
Meanwhile, back at the village,

00:12:58.380 --> 00:13:01.320
the others try to figure why Balto went looking for them.

00:13:01.440 --> 00:13:02.620
"He's tracking them."

00:13:02.700 --> 00:13:06.120
"--tracking a championship team in a blizzard?"

00:13:06.220 --> 00:13:08.040
[laughter]

00:13:08.040 --> 00:13:09.420
[laughs]

00:13:09.420 --> 00:13:12.320
Kids are dying still, you gotta laugh, don't ya?

00:13:12.480 --> 00:13:15.940
[laughter]

00:13:18.280 --> 00:13:19.960
But Steele makes it back.

00:13:19.960 --> 00:13:23.760
He tells them the false story about how 
Balto tried to sabotage the mission

00:13:23.760 --> 00:13:25.920
ending up with the other dogs getting killed.

00:13:26.140 --> 00:13:29.820
"I went on...dragging the medicine alone. All alone."

00:13:29.820 --> 00:13:33.380
"Balto...he demanded I let him take the medicine!"

00:13:33.740 --> 00:13:35.840
"But couldn't handle it!"

00:13:36.400 --> 00:13:40.920
"He...made me promise to take care of you, Jenna."

00:13:41.340 --> 00:13:42.300
Wow...

00:13:42.520 --> 00:13:46.660
This guy is such an obvious, yet evil, liar, 
he should probably get a job at the White House.

00:13:46.920 --> 00:13:47.600
[crowd chattering]

00:13:47.700 --> 00:13:51.020
"The other dogs died and I was the only one left. PERIOD."

00:13:51.260 --> 00:13:56.760
"Also, the race I was a part of had the largest audience to ever witness a dog sled race. PERIOD.

00:13:56.760 --> 00:13:58.420
"But sir, we have eyes..."

00:13:58.420 --> 00:13:59.400
"YOU'RE EYES ARE WRONG!"

00:13:59.400 --> 00:14:00.680
"It's an alternative bark!"

00:14:00.680 --> 00:14:01.460
"But Melissa--,"

00:14:01.460 --> 00:14:03.720
"Stop calling me that!"

00:14:04.440 --> 00:14:10.400
But Jenna doesn't believe him and knows that Balto is still out there trying to get the medicine for poor Rosie.

00:14:10.640 --> 00:14:11.440
[music]

00:14:11.800 --> 00:14:13.500
Rosie: [wheezing]

00:14:13.640 --> 00:14:15.560
Hey, do you have any nicotine patches?

00:14:15.660 --> 00:14:17.000
No, and what they hell are you doing here?

00:14:17.020 --> 00:14:18.720
Well, I've been coughing up a lung on your couch

00:14:18.720 --> 00:14:21.320
I figured if I was light headed, I wouldn't mind so much.

00:14:21.400 --> 00:14:22.900
Why are you sleeping on my couch?

00:14:22.900 --> 00:14:23.660
It's a nice couch.

00:14:23.660 --> 00:14:24.360
GET OUT OF HERE!

00:14:24.360 --> 00:14:24.860
Okay.

00:14:25.640 --> 00:14:28.100
DUDE! That's your only contribution to this story?

00:14:28.100 --> 00:14:29.540
Just laying in bed and coughing?

00:14:29.540 --> 00:14:30.200
Maybe.

00:14:30.200 --> 00:14:32.340
How did you know that any of this was going on then?

00:14:32.500 --> 00:14:35.780
You weren't there, you didn't see it and the
 majority of it sounds unimpressively made up!

00:14:35.780 --> 00:14:38.120
Look, kid, what am I supposed to say here?

00:14:38.120 --> 00:14:39.920
"And then I looked at the ceiling longer."

00:14:39.920 --> 00:14:42.120
"And then I coughed 87 more times."

00:14:42.120 --> 00:14:43.160
I've got to embellish.

00:14:43.160 --> 00:14:45.100
Is any of this story true!?

00:14:45.100 --> 00:14:48.660
Come on, is it so hard to believe that I was lost, 
passed out and annoying people?

00:14:48.660 --> 00:14:49.700
I guess that's a good point.

00:14:49.740 --> 00:14:51.840
Speaking of which, go get me some gin from the fridge.

00:14:51.840 --> 00:14:54.480
I'm gonna see how many shots it 
takes to forget your name.

00:15:09.940 --> 00:15:16.240
Hey guys! You want to meet me, the Channel Awesome Team and see the premier of one of our reviews on the big screen? Well you can!

00:15:16.240 --> 00:15:19.920
On May 3rd at Hollywood Boulevard 
Theater in Woodridge, Illinois

00:15:19.920 --> 00:15:23.280
We'll be premiering our clip-less review of 
Suicide Squad.

00:15:23.280 --> 00:15:26.020
This is one of the best movie theaters you'll ever go to.

00:15:26.020 --> 00:15:30.160
It has memorabilia, themed theaters, food, alcohol, relaxing chairs

00:15:30.160 --> 00:15:31.420
and of course us!

00:15:31.540 --> 00:15:35.140
We'll be signing autographs in the lobby at 
7 PM and start the show at 9

00:15:35.240 --> 00:15:37.080
and we'll even do a Q&amp;A right after.

00:15:37.580 --> 00:15:41.500
Tickets are 20 dollars and you can get them at link below at TheAwesomeStore.com

00:15:41.660 --> 00:15:43.780
Show does require the purchase of a food or drink

00:15:43.780 --> 00:15:47.720
and we will verify purchased tickets at the event, 
and hand out your printed tickets there.

00:15:48.060 --> 00:15:51.560
Guys, we've never done this before, 
so we have no idea how fast tickets are gonna go,

00:15:51.560 --> 00:15:53.320
so, best get them as early as you can.

00:15:53.520 --> 00:15:56.640
Come say hi, enjoy the show 
and hopefully, we'll see you there!

00:16:05.180 --> 00:16:09.100
So, Balto is separated from his team 
and still has the medicine but comes across--

00:16:09.100 --> 00:16:10.820
[orchestral music plays]

00:16:13.480 --> 00:16:15.720
Kimba the White Wolf?

00:16:16.200 --> 00:16:20.020
[howling]

00:16:20.620 --> 00:16:22.040
Nostalgia Critic: "Welp, that's all I got."

00:16:22.040 --> 00:16:24.760
"I went all 'roooo' man. To us, that's like brain surgery."

00:16:24.920 --> 00:16:28.080
[howling]

00:16:28.500 --> 00:16:32.820
So, apparently, that gives him superpowers 
to drag the medicine up a cliff.

00:16:34.460 --> 00:16:36.980
How do you think Grandma explained that?

00:16:37.140 --> 00:16:41.140
Nostalgia Critic: "And then the god 
of the wolves came or something..."
-"Wait, what?"

00:16:41.140 --> 00:16:44.880
"And then they howled at the sky, making Balto physically stronger, I guess..."

00:16:44.880 --> 00:16:46.300
"-I'm not following any of this..."

00:16:46.300 --> 00:16:53.120
"And even though that wolf could've helped pull the sled or give directions, he just kind of disappeared and was never seen again."

00:16:53.120 --> 00:16:54.440
"Grandma, are you off your meds?"

00:16:54.440 --> 00:16:56.540
"They make me catch the gay!"

00:16:57.020 --> 00:17:01.520
So, the team is back on track 
as Balto uses his nose to find the way.

00:17:02.060 --> 00:17:04.400
Why didn't he just use that before?

00:17:04.640 --> 00:17:08.780
Is that like a weird prejudice too, 
dogs don't sniff to find stuff?

00:17:08.780 --> 00:17:10.140
"How dare you use your nose!?"

00:17:10.140 --> 00:17:12.760
"Don't you know what disgusting 
animal you're sounding like?"

00:17:13.120 --> 00:17:15.240
"Toucan Sam."

00:17:16.220 --> 00:17:19.120
But because this film loves to punish all signs of hope,

00:17:19.120 --> 00:17:21.280
it tries to toss them off a bridge.

00:17:26.400 --> 00:17:27.940
Followed by an avalanche.

00:17:28.040 --> 00:17:29.320
Oh, come on!

[suspensful music plays]

00:17:31.740 --> 00:17:32.740
[rumbling]

00:17:33.320 --> 00:17:35.700
The moral of the story is "nature sucks," kids.

00:17:35.700 --> 00:17:37.920
Don't play in the snow, it'll someday fight back!

00:17:37.920 --> 00:17:39.300
[loud crashing]

00:17:41.780 --> 00:17:43.660
Hey, you know what's missing in this scene?

00:17:43.660 --> 00:17:45.220
A Phil Collins song.

00:17:56.060 --> 00:18:00.400
They get trapped inside a cave where the movie 
reminds us that Spielberg produced this film.

00:18:01.060 --> 00:18:02.500
"Oh..."

00:18:02.720 --> 00:18:06.640
"I'll be right in my legal authority to satirize this property."

00:18:07.300 --> 00:18:10.340
But, if that two seconds of 
levity was overbearing, don't worry,

00:18:10.340 --> 00:18:12.940
because giant killer icicles are after them now.

00:18:13.040 --> 00:18:14.420
[crashing]

00:18:14.900 --> 00:18:18.840
[explosions and yelling]

00:18:19.660 --> 00:18:22.240
Oh, look! The medicine crate has a crack in it too.

00:18:22.900 --> 00:18:23.400
[glass crashing]

00:18:23.440 --> 00:18:24.840
"FUCK YOU!!"

00:18:28.160 --> 00:18:29.580
They should call this movie

00:18:34.520 --> 00:18:40.400
They do eventually make it out though as Jenna reflects some bottles that apparently light up the entire town

00:18:40.400 --> 00:18:43.520
which Balto would have plainly seen anyway, 
so it was kind of pointless.

00:18:43.600 --> 00:18:45.180
"Balto's back!"

00:18:45.420 --> 00:18:48.680
[howling]

00:18:49.080 --> 00:18:51.800
Ooh...and a meteor hits him.

00:18:51.800 --> 00:18:56.520
I'm so sorry, kids. Life just didn't like this dog. 
Nature is kind of like God's hitman.

00:18:57.000 --> 00:19:00.820
But news reaches Steele about Balto's return, 
which pisses off the rest.

00:19:00.820 --> 00:19:03.240
Steele: "Okay, okay... I can explain."

00:19:03.240 --> 00:19:05.800
"You guys weren't there, so you don't..."

00:19:05.800 --> 00:19:08.180
"Wait, guys! Wait, just a second..."

00:19:08.340 --> 00:19:11.320
"Oh, come on! 
I was trying to do a reverse Cruella De Vil!"

wants to kill a bunch of little kids."

"I will be on someone's Best Villains List!"

00:19:17.060 --> 00:19:20.380
The medicine is received, 
Balto gives a hat made from his brethren

00:19:20.380 --> 00:19:23.640
and Jenna gives him the equivalent of dog frenching.

00:19:23.920 --> 00:19:28.980
Well, this is such a joyous occasion, 
let's give Balto absolutely no lines what-so-ever!

00:19:29.360 --> 00:19:30.920
Yeah, I'm not even kidding.

00:19:30.920 --> 00:19:34.800
He doesn't speak in the last 25 minutes of this movie.

00:19:34.920 --> 00:19:39.260
They cut his dialogue aside from an occasional word like "Oof!" or "Ahh!"

00:19:39.420 --> 00:19:44.460
The other dogs get a lot of lines, but for 
whatever reason, Balto is almost completely silent.

00:19:44.580 --> 00:19:46.840
Then again, that might be for the best.

00:19:46.840 --> 00:19:51.420
With everything they threw at him, his dialogue 
probably wouldn't be very kid friendly.

00:19:52.160 --> 00:19:53.200
Nostalgia Critic: "Ah, shit!"

00:19:54.060 --> 00:19:55.200
"God damn it!"

00:19:55.200 --> 00:19:56.260
[loud rumbling]

00:19:56.260 --> 00:20:00.040
"Seriously, did I run over a leprechaun? 
What is with the bullshit bad luck!?"

00:20:00.980 --> 00:20:03.440
Girl: "This is it, Grandma! Blaze found it!"

00:20:03.440 --> 00:20:08.980
So, Rosie's story seems to be over as they find the monument dedicated to the dogs that made that journey.

00:20:09.220 --> 00:20:11.680
"-in the winter of 1925."

00:20:11.940 --> 00:20:14.740
"Balto really did do all of that, didn't he, Grandma?"

00:20:14.760 --> 00:20:17.640
"Oh, yes, sweetheart. He really did."

00:20:20.440 --> 00:20:21.320
I shouldn't.

00:20:22.040 --> 00:20:23.580
I really shouldn't.

00:20:24.840 --> 00:20:28.540
Come on, let the kids have their "true story."

00:20:30.520 --> 00:20:31.280
-Okay!

00:20:31.620 --> 00:20:34.000
Balto...facts.

00:20:35.980 --> 00:20:36.940
You're not gonna like it.

00:20:37.900 --> 00:20:39.660
You're REALLY no gonna like it.

00:20:41.140 --> 00:20:46.960
[clears throat]
Balto did not run the longest nor 
most hazardous part of the journey.

00:20:46.960 --> 00:20:50.920
The most dangerous and 
longest run was led by a dog named Togo

00:20:51.120 --> 00:20:53.360
driven by a musher named Seppala.

00:20:53.560 --> 00:20:58.480
In fact, there were twenty mushers of 
varying dogs used to make the journey.

00:20:58.580 --> 00:21:03.640
Balto just happened to be the last one, 
so he got the majority of the credit.

00:21:03.640 --> 00:21:08.940
While Seppala and Togo did the hardest work, 
it was Balto that got all the fame.

00:21:08.940 --> 00:21:11.040
Even from President Calvin Coolidge.

00:21:11.380 --> 00:21:17.000
In fact, there was such a hatred for 
Balto getting all the credit that him and his owner-

00:21:17.080 --> 00:21:22.280
-weren't even welcome to the award ceremony 
in New York for Seppala and Togo.

00:21:25.900 --> 00:21:27.500
This was all BULLSHIT, wasn't it!?

00:21:27.520 --> 00:21:32.060
Well, there was an incredible review 
done entirely by the Nostalgia Critic.

00:21:32.220 --> 00:21:33.340
-Ah, there it is.

00:21:33.340 --> 00:21:33.900
[gasps]

00:21:33.900 --> 00:21:35.180
About time I film this sucker.

00:21:35.180 --> 00:21:39.440
Wait a minute! Nostalgia Critic is still alive 
and he hasn't even filmed the review yet!?

00:21:39.440 --> 00:21:41.800
Well, no...Random Kid.

00:21:41.800 --> 00:21:43.900
I was just about to, 
but I had to get the script from my brother.

00:21:43.900 --> 00:21:46.520
You see, I was sick, 
so he wrote the majority of it this week.

00:21:46.540 --> 00:21:47.880
Oh, my god...

00:21:47.880 --> 00:21:50.000
So, we're not even in the future, are we!?

00:21:51.700 --> 00:21:53.460
You're a special kid, aren't ya?

00:21:53.460 --> 00:21:55.540
But what about the text that says we are?

00:21:55.540 --> 00:21:57.440
Oh, that's just my satanic arts.

00:21:57.460 --> 00:21:58.340
[creepy choir music plays]

00:21:59.700 --> 00:22:00.460
You lied!

00:22:00.860 --> 00:22:02.740
You lied about practically everything!

00:22:02.740 --> 00:22:05.680
Okay, look. 
Maybe everything didn't happen like I said,

00:22:05.680 --> 00:22:11.380
maybe credit was given to the wrong person 
and maybe like 98% of what you heard was false.

00:22:11.520 --> 00:22:13.660
But...did you have fun?

00:22:14.160 --> 00:22:14.840
I guess.

00:22:14.840 --> 00:22:17.460
Was it corny but beautiful at times?

00:22:17.620 --> 00:22:18.300
I suppose...

00:22:18.300 --> 00:22:22.580
And did you know anything at all 
about these dogs saving kids before I told you?

00:22:22.880 --> 00:22:23.600
Not really.

00:22:23.600 --> 00:22:28.360
Well, then! For pulling most of this out of my ass, 
I'd say we had a pretty entertaining time.

00:22:28.740 --> 00:22:30.460
Well, I never thought of it like that.

00:22:30.460 --> 00:22:33.280
Hey, Critic, what did you think of Balto, by the way?

00:22:33.860 --> 00:22:34.820
Basically, that.

00:22:34.820 --> 00:22:35.940
Oh, wow!

00:22:35.940 --> 00:22:38.220
Maybe there's more truth to fiction than I thought!

00:22:38.220 --> 00:22:40.520
-Actually, there isn't, that was just a huge coincidence.

00:22:40.520 --> 00:22:42.420
Speaking of which, why did you 
bring her here, to begin with?

00:22:42.420 --> 00:22:44.960
Oh, I just wanted to leave her here 
so I didn't have to tell her that

00:22:44.960 --> 00:22:48.560
both parents died from double erotic asphyxiation.

00:22:49.080 --> 00:22:50.260
[silence]

00:22:50.780 --> 00:22:53.080
Well, that backfired. She's all your, Critic!

00:22:54.100 --> 00:22:58.320
What kept you!?
-A child's mind is very delicate. Floor it!

00:22:58.480 --> 00:23:00.020
[engine roaring]

00:23:00.660 --> 00:23:01.800
[sniffling]

00:23:03.740 --> 00:23:09.380
Don't worry, I know a certain long faced, balding big toothed comedian who would love to take care of you.

00:23:09.720 --> 00:23:10.560
Oh...

00:23:11.620 --> 00:23:12.160
[yelps]

00:23:12.160 --> 00:23:13.340
Nostalgia Critic: She's all yours, Chester.

00:23:13.340 --> 00:23:15.180
Oh my god! I'm a mother!

00:23:16.260 --> 00:23:17.820
[crying]

Steele: Well, maybe your taste runs more toward wolf.

00:24:22.840 --> 00:24:27.400
Hey, Doug Walker here doing the charity shoutout. And this week, we're doing 'The One Acre Fund'

00:24:28.800 --> 00:24:36.420
This organization empowers chronically hungry farm families in East Africa to lift themselves out of hunger and poverty.

00:24:36.420 --> 00:24:42.060
They supply small holder farms with the financing and training they need to grow their way out.

00:24:42.060 --> 00:24:46.440
They invest in farmers to generate a permanent gain in farm income.

00:24:46.440 --> 00:24:52.040
That means they provide a complete service; bundles of seeds and fertilizer, financing, training,

00:24:52.040 --> 00:24:57.960
and deliver these services within walking distance of the four hundred thousands rural farmers they serve.

00:24:57.960 --> 00:25:03.860
They measure success in their ability to make farmers more prosperous and they always put the farmers first.

00:25:03.860 --> 00:25:08.360
If you go to their YouTube page, you can see all the various people they helped in the past

00:25:08.360 --> 00:25:12.560
and if you go to their site, you can how YOU can help them in their mission.

00:25:12.560 --> 00:25:16.160
