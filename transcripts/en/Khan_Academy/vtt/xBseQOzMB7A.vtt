00:00:00.225 --> 00:00:01.659
- [Instructor] So right
over here we wanna compute

00:00:01.659 --> 00:00:05.826
what three times 0.25 or
three times 25 hundredths is.

00:00:07.342 --> 00:00:09.309
And so I encourage you to pause the video

00:00:09.309 --> 00:00:11.542
and see if you can figure this out.

00:00:11.542 --> 00:00:13.259
Alright, now let's work
through this together.

00:00:13.259 --> 00:00:16.809
And in this video, we're gonna
explore multiple strategies.

00:00:16.809 --> 00:00:19.558
In the future, we're going
to show you what's called

00:00:19.558 --> 00:00:22.525
the standard strategy,
which you might use a lot,

00:00:22.525 --> 00:00:24.039
but the strategies we're
gonna look at in this video

00:00:24.039 --> 00:00:26.139
are actually very
helpful for understanding

00:00:26.139 --> 00:00:28.755
what multiplying decimals actually means,

00:00:28.755 --> 00:00:31.194
how it relates to multiplying fractions,

00:00:31.194 --> 00:00:33.688
as often the way that people, even people

00:00:33.688 --> 00:00:35.101
who have a lot of math behind them,

00:00:35.101 --> 00:00:37.501
how they actually multiply decimals.

00:00:37.501 --> 00:00:40.234
So here, three times 25 hundredths.

00:00:40.234 --> 00:00:42.852
There's a couple of
ways to think about it.

00:00:42.852 --> 00:00:45.208
One way is to say, hey,
this is the same thing

00:00:45.208 --> 00:00:49.534
as three times, and I'm just
gonna write it a different way.

00:00:49.534 --> 00:00:50.701
25 hundredths,

00:00:52.114 --> 00:00:53.031
hundredths.

00:00:54.324 --> 00:00:56.573
If I have three times 25 of something,

00:00:56.573 --> 00:00:58.391
what is it going to be?

00:00:58.391 --> 00:01:00.973
Well, what's three times 25?

00:01:00.973 --> 00:01:01.806
Let's see.

00:01:01.806 --> 00:01:05.627
Two times 25 is 50, three times 25 is

00:01:05.627 --> 00:01:06.960
75.

00:01:06.960 --> 00:01:09.809
So it's going to be 75,
and I'm multiplying,

00:01:09.809 --> 00:01:11.693
not just three times 25, I'm multiplying

00:01:11.693 --> 00:01:13.926
three times 25 hundredths.

00:01:13.926 --> 00:01:17.825
Instead of 25 hundredths,
I'm gonna have 75,

00:01:17.825 --> 00:01:18.992
75 hundredths.

00:01:20.375 --> 00:01:23.359
Written out in words, this
would be 75 hundredths.

00:01:23.359 --> 00:01:25.842
How would we write that as a decimal?

00:01:25.842 --> 00:01:30.230
That is the same thing
as this, 75 hundredths.

00:01:30.230 --> 00:01:32.758
Another way to conceptualize
this, to think about

00:01:32.758 --> 00:01:36.841
what this is, is if we
were to write three times,

00:01:37.908 --> 00:01:39.574
we could write it as a fraction.

00:01:39.574 --> 00:01:42.408
We could write 25/100.

00:01:42.408 --> 00:01:45.424
This is another way of
writing 25 hundredths.

00:01:45.424 --> 00:01:47.734
These are all equivalent.

00:01:47.734 --> 00:01:50.901
What is three times 25/100?

00:01:51.907 --> 00:01:52.856
Same idea.

00:01:52.856 --> 00:01:55.738
This is going to be equal to,

00:01:55.738 --> 00:02:00.453
you could say this is 25/100
plus 25/100 plus 25/100.

00:02:00.453 --> 00:02:03.286
This is going to be 75 hundredths,

00:02:04.716 --> 00:02:06.799
which once again is 0.75.

00:02:08.546 --> 00:02:10.309
If you wanted to more formally view it

00:02:10.309 --> 00:02:14.610
as fraction multiplication,
you could view it as 3/1

00:02:14.610 --> 00:02:16.610
times 25/100,

00:02:18.916 --> 00:02:20.666
and you multiply the numerators,

00:02:20.666 --> 00:02:23.935
you get 75, you multiply the
denominators, you get 100.

00:02:23.935 --> 00:02:25.715
Either way, in all of these situations,

00:02:25.715 --> 00:02:28.597
you're gonna get 75 hundredths.

00:02:28.597 --> 00:02:30.330
Or, another way to think about it,

00:02:30.330 --> 00:02:33.296
is hey look, this thing right over here,

00:02:33.296 --> 00:02:37.463
this 25/100, this is
the same thing as 1/4.

00:02:38.632 --> 00:02:41.381
So you could view this as three times 1/4.

00:02:41.381 --> 00:02:43.230
In fact, this is a decimal
that it's good to recognize

00:02:43.230 --> 00:02:45.497
that this is the same thing as 1/4.

00:02:45.497 --> 00:02:49.638
So you could view this as three times 1/4,

00:02:49.638 --> 00:02:51.621
or 3/4,

00:02:51.621 --> 00:02:53.591
this is a fourth right
here, 1/4 could be viewed

00:02:53.591 --> 00:02:55.904
as a fourth, so this is going to be equal

00:02:55.904 --> 00:02:58.821
to 3/4, three over four,

00:03:01.711 --> 00:03:03.077
3/4.

00:03:03.077 --> 00:03:04.826
All of these are equivalent.

00:03:04.826 --> 00:03:06.692
If someone wanted it
written out as a decimal,

00:03:06.692 --> 00:03:09.577
you could, you might know that 3/4

00:03:09.577 --> 00:03:12.276
can be expressed as 75 hundredths,

00:03:12.276 --> 00:03:14.659
which in general, is a good thing to know.

00:03:14.659 --> 00:03:19.058
Now let's tackle slightly
more complicated examples.

00:03:19.058 --> 00:03:21.891
Let's say we wanted to figure out,

00:03:22.942 --> 00:03:25.609
we wanted to figure out what 0.4

00:03:27.761 --> 00:03:28.594
times

00:03:29.878 --> 00:03:31.060
zero,

00:03:31.060 --> 00:03:32.810
let me just do this in a new color,

00:03:32.810 --> 00:03:35.643
times 0.3 is going to be equal to.

00:03:36.492 --> 00:03:38.576
Pause the video and see
if you can compute this,

00:03:38.576 --> 00:03:39.959
and I'll give you a hint, see if you

00:03:39.959 --> 00:03:42.542
can express these as fractions.

00:03:44.743 --> 00:03:46.809
What we have here in
white, we could read this

00:03:46.809 --> 00:03:48.059
as four tenths,

00:03:50.445 --> 00:03:51.528
and we could write it as a fraction,

00:03:51.528 --> 00:03:54.661
as 4/10, and we're gonna multiply

00:03:54.661 --> 00:03:57.361
that by what we have over here.

00:03:57.361 --> 00:03:59.111
This is three tenths,

00:04:00.244 --> 00:04:01.327
three tenths,

00:04:02.297 --> 00:04:06.287
which we could write
as a fraction as 3/10,

00:04:06.287 --> 00:04:08.585
and so you could view this as 4/10 of 3/10

00:04:08.585 --> 00:04:11.219
or 3/10 of 4/10, but we're
multiplying these fractions,

00:04:11.219 --> 00:04:13.969
which we've seen before in other videos.

00:04:13.969 --> 00:04:15.285
What's going to happen?

00:04:15.285 --> 00:04:18.085
Well, if we multiply
the numerator we get 12,

00:04:18.085 --> 00:04:19.385
or the numerators.

00:04:19.385 --> 00:04:21.709
We multiply the denominators, you get 100.

00:04:21.709 --> 00:04:23.856
So you get 12 hundredths.

00:04:23.856 --> 00:04:25.372
If you wanted to write that as a decimal,

00:04:25.372 --> 00:04:26.789
it would be 0.12,

00:04:28.011 --> 00:04:29.178
12 hundredths.

00:04:30.127 --> 00:04:32.028
You might notice something
interesting here,

00:04:32.028 --> 00:04:33.844
and you'll see this more and more

00:04:33.844 --> 00:04:36.661
as you learn the standard method.

00:04:36.661 --> 00:04:39.078
12 is four times three is 12,

00:04:40.900 --> 00:04:43.294
but now I have two digits
behind the decimal,

00:04:43.294 --> 00:04:45.353
but notice, I have one digit
behind the decimal here,

00:04:45.353 --> 00:04:47.119
one digit behind the decimal here,

00:04:47.119 --> 00:04:50.151
for a total of two digits
behind the decimal.

00:04:50.151 --> 00:04:51.452
I'm giving you a little bit of a hint

00:04:51.452 --> 00:04:53.786
about where we're going,
but the important thing

00:04:53.786 --> 00:04:55.035
for this video is to recognize

00:04:55.035 --> 00:04:58.451
that you can re-express
each of these as fractions,

00:04:58.451 --> 00:05:00.527
and then multiply the
fractions to get something

00:05:00.527 --> 00:05:02.262
expressed in terms of hundredths,

00:05:02.262 --> 00:05:05.179
and then express that as a decimal.
