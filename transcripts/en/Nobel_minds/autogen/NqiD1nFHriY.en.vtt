hello my name's David I'm 17 I'm

00:00:02.629 --> 00:00:02.639
hello my name's David I'm 17 I'm
 

00:00:02.639 --> 00:00:04.670
hello my name's David I'm 17 I'm
studying physics available I was just

00:00:04.670 --> 00:00:04.680
studying physics available I was just
 

00:00:04.680 --> 00:00:06.470
studying physics available I was just
wondering if there are parallel worlds

00:00:06.470 --> 00:00:06.480
wondering if there are parallel worlds
 

00:00:06.480 --> 00:00:08.240
wondering if there are parallel worlds
what would happen if we travel to it

00:00:08.240 --> 00:00:08.250
what would happen if we travel to it
 

00:00:08.250 --> 00:00:11.900
what would happen if we travel to it
with a funding at the same time I David

you're asking about parallel worlds well

00:00:13.999 --> 00:00:14.009
you're asking about parallel worlds well
 

00:00:14.009 --> 00:00:15.289
you're asking about parallel worlds well
there are two meanings of parallel

00:00:15.289 --> 00:00:15.299
there are two meanings of parallel
 

00:00:15.299 --> 00:00:17.510
there are two meanings of parallel
worlds in science one would be that

00:00:17.510 --> 00:00:17.520
worlds in science one would be that
 

00:00:17.520 --> 00:00:19.189
worlds in science one would be that
there are many other universes

00:00:19.189 --> 00:00:19.199
there are many other universes
 

00:00:19.199 --> 00:00:21.580
there are many other universes
paralleling ours maybe with separate

00:00:21.580 --> 00:00:21.590
paralleling ours maybe with separate
 

00:00:21.590 --> 00:00:24.560
paralleling ours maybe with separate
origins and maybe there's an infinite

00:00:24.560 --> 00:00:24.570
origins and maybe there's an infinite
 

00:00:24.570 --> 00:00:26.750
origins and maybe there's an infinite
number of such parallel universes in

00:00:26.750 --> 00:00:26.760
number of such parallel universes in
 

00:00:26.760 --> 00:00:29.599
number of such parallel universes in
that case we have no idea whether we

00:00:29.599 --> 00:00:29.609
that case we have no idea whether we
 

00:00:29.609 --> 00:00:31.009
that case we have no idea whether we
could get there from here

00:00:31.009 --> 00:00:31.019
could get there from here
 

00:00:31.019 --> 00:00:33.560
could get there from here
probably never that would be the first

00:00:33.560 --> 00:00:33.570
probably never that would be the first
 

00:00:33.570 --> 00:00:36.350
probably never that would be the first
guess we have very little evidence or

00:00:36.350 --> 00:00:36.360
guess we have very little evidence or
 

00:00:36.360 --> 00:00:37.940
guess we have very little evidence or
ways of measuring the presence of such

00:00:37.940 --> 00:00:37.950
ways of measuring the presence of such
 

00:00:37.950 --> 00:00:39.530
ways of measuring the presence of such
parallel universes that are really

00:00:39.530 --> 00:00:39.540
parallel universes that are really
 

00:00:39.540 --> 00:00:41.450
parallel universes that are really
distinct on the other hand there's

00:00:41.450 --> 00:00:41.460
distinct on the other hand there's
 

00:00:41.460 --> 00:00:43.160
distinct on the other hand there's
another parallel universe meaning in

00:00:43.160 --> 00:00:43.170
another parallel universe meaning in
 

00:00:43.170 --> 00:00:45.170
another parallel universe meaning in
science which is that of quantum

00:00:45.170 --> 00:00:45.180
science which is that of quantum
 

00:00:45.180 --> 00:00:47.360
science which is that of quantum
mechanics and where we talk about the

00:00:47.360 --> 00:00:47.370
mechanics and where we talk about the
 

00:00:47.370 --> 00:00:51.080
mechanics and where we talk about the
probability waves for particles and and

00:00:51.080 --> 00:00:51.090
probability waves for particles and and
 

00:00:51.090 --> 00:00:54.950
probability waves for particles and and
particle behavior of wavelets so all of

00:00:54.950 --> 00:00:54.960
particle behavior of wavelets so all of
 

00:00:54.960 --> 00:00:57.229
particle behavior of wavelets so all of
these things are a little mysterious and

00:00:57.229 --> 00:00:57.239
these things are a little mysterious and
 

00:00:57.239 --> 00:00:59.569
these things are a little mysterious and
it's a whole other subject which I can't

00:00:59.569 --> 00:00:59.579
it's a whole other subject which I can't
 

00:00:59.579 --> 00:01:00.979
it's a whole other subject which I can't
really explain I find it very confusing

00:01:00.979 --> 00:01:00.989
really explain I find it very confusing
 

00:01:00.989 --> 00:01:04.280
really explain I find it very confusing
myself sorry
