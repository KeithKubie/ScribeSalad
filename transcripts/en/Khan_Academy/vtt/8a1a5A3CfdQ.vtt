00:00:00.720 --> 00:00:02.000
- [Voiceover] So, this table here

00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:03.200
where you're given a bunch of Ns,

00:00:03.200 --> 00:00:04.620
N equals one, two, three, four,

00:00:04.620 --> 00:00:06.930
and we get the corresponding G of N.

00:00:06.930 --> 00:00:08.800
And one way to think about
it is that this function,

00:00:08.800 --> 00:00:13.290
G, defines a sequence where N
is the term of the sequence.

00:00:13.290 --> 00:00:15.200
So for example, we could
say this is the same thing

00:00:15.200 --> 00:00:18.910
as the sequence where
the first term is 168,

00:00:18.910 --> 00:00:23.910
second term is 84, third term is 42,

00:00:24.079 --> 00:00:29.079
and fourth term is 21,
and we keep going on,

00:00:29.330 --> 00:00:30.830
and on, and on.

00:00:30.830 --> 00:00:32.930
Now, let's think about what
type of a sequence this is.

00:00:32.930 --> 00:00:36.160
If we think of it as starting at 168,

00:00:36.160 --> 00:00:38.890
and how do we go from 168 to 84?

00:00:38.890 --> 00:00:41.480
Well, one way, you could
say we subtract at 84,

00:00:41.480 --> 00:00:42.790
but another way to think about it is you

00:00:42.790 --> 00:00:44.960
multiply it by one half.

00:00:44.960 --> 00:00:47.630
So, times one half.

00:00:47.630 --> 00:00:49.730
And then to go from 84 to 42,

00:00:49.730 --> 00:00:51.650
you multiply by one half again.

00:00:51.650 --> 00:00:53.150
Times one half.

00:00:53.150 --> 00:00:57.350
And to go from 42 to 21, you
multiply by one half again.

00:00:57.720 --> 00:00:59.560
So, this right over here
is a geometric series.

00:00:59.560 --> 00:01:02.160
We're starting at a term
and every successive term

00:01:02.160 --> 00:01:06.350
is the previous term
times, it's often called

00:01:06.350 --> 00:01:09.580
the common ratio, times one half.

00:01:09.580 --> 00:01:12.320
So, how can we write G
of N, how can we define

00:01:12.320 --> 00:01:14.860
this explicitly in terms of N?

00:01:14.860 --> 00:01:16.050
And I encourage you to pause the video

00:01:16.050 --> 00:01:17.420
and think about how to do that.

00:01:17.420 --> 00:01:21.181
So, construct a, so,
if I say G of N equals,

00:01:21.181 --> 00:01:23.190
think of a function
definition that describes

00:01:23.190 --> 00:01:25.490
what we've just seen here starting at 168,

00:01:25.490 --> 00:01:28.060
and then multiplying
by one half every time

00:01:28.060 --> 00:01:29.920
you add a new term.

00:01:29.920 --> 00:01:34.180
Well, one way to think
about it is we start at 168,

00:01:34.790 --> 00:01:38.330
and then we're gonna multiply by one half,

00:01:38.330 --> 00:01:42.230
we're gonna multiply by one
half a certain number of times.

00:01:42.230 --> 00:01:45.100
So, we could view the exponent
as the number of times

00:01:45.100 --> 00:01:47.160
we multiply by one half.

00:01:47.160 --> 00:01:49.260
And how many times are we
gonna multiply by one half?

00:01:49.260 --> 00:01:52.792
The first term, we multiply
by one half zero times.

00:01:52.792 --> 00:01:55.950
The second term, we multiply
by one half one time.

00:01:55.950 --> 00:01:58.820
Third term, we multiply
by one half two times.

00:01:58.820 --> 00:02:01.878
Fourth term, we multiply
by one half three times.

00:02:01.878 --> 00:02:04.300
So, the figure, it seems
like whatever term we're on,

00:02:04.300 --> 00:02:08.630
we're multiplying by one half,
that term minus one times.

00:02:08.630 --> 00:02:10.120
And you can see that this works.

00:02:10.120 --> 00:02:12.430
If N is equal to one, you're going to have

00:02:12.430 --> 00:02:14.660
one minus one, that's just gonna be zero.

00:02:14.660 --> 00:02:16.300
One half to the zero's just one.

00:02:16.300 --> 00:02:18.260
So, you're just gonna get a 168.

00:02:18.260 --> 00:02:20.320
If N is two, well, two minus one,

00:02:20.320 --> 00:02:22.940
you're gonna multiply
by one half one time,

00:02:22.940 --> 00:02:24.690
which you see right over here, N is three,

00:02:24.690 --> 00:02:27.130
you're gonna multiply by one half twice.

00:02:27.130 --> 00:02:31.750
Three minus two is, or,
three minus one is two.

00:02:31.750 --> 00:02:33.230
You're gonna multiply by one half twice,

00:02:33.230 --> 00:02:35.490
and you see that right over there.

00:02:35.490 --> 00:02:39.790
So, this feels like a really
nice explicit definition

00:02:39.790 --> 00:02:42.050
for this geometric series.

00:02:42.050 --> 00:02:43.400
And you can think of it in other ways,

00:02:43.400 --> 00:02:47.740
you could write this
as G of N is equal to,

00:02:48.120 --> 00:02:50.220
let's see, one way you could write it, as,

00:02:50.220 --> 00:02:52.920
you could write it as 168,
and I'm just algebraically

00:02:52.920 --> 00:02:56.350
manipulating it over
two to the N minus one.

00:02:56.350 --> 00:02:57.675
Another way you could think about it is,

00:02:57.675 --> 00:03:01.090
well, let's use our exponent
properties a little bit,

00:03:01.090 --> 00:03:05.030
we could say G of N is
equal to, let's see,

00:03:05.030 --> 00:03:07.290
one half to the N minus
one, that's the same thing

00:03:07.290 --> 00:03:09.494
as one half, let me write this.

00:03:09.494 --> 00:03:12.520
It's equal to 168.

00:03:12.520 --> 00:03:14.221
Lemme do this in a different color.

00:03:14.221 --> 00:03:16.760
So, this part right over
here is the same thing

00:03:16.760 --> 00:03:18.470
as one half to the N.

00:03:18.470 --> 00:03:22.760
So, times one half to
the N, times one half

00:03:22.760 --> 00:03:24.300
to the negative one.

00:03:24.300 --> 00:03:26.530
One half to the negative one.

00:03:26.530 --> 00:03:27.820
Well, one half to the negative one

00:03:27.820 --> 00:03:31.420
is just two, is just two, so,

00:03:31.420 --> 00:03:33.879
this is times two.

00:03:33.879 --> 00:03:36.790
So, we could rewrite this whole thing as

00:03:36.790 --> 00:03:39.560
168 times two is what?

00:03:39.560 --> 00:03:41.620
336?

00:03:41.620 --> 00:03:43.200
336, did I do that right?

00:03:43.200 --> 00:03:47.500
160 times two would be 320, plus 16,

00:03:47.500 --> 00:03:50.030
two times eight, so yeah, 336.

00:03:50.030 --> 00:03:52.660
And then times one half to the N.

00:03:52.660 --> 00:03:55.720
Times one half to the N.

00:03:55.720 --> 00:03:57.970
So, these are equivalent statements.

00:03:57.970 --> 00:03:59.750
This one makes a little
bit more intuitive sense,

00:03:59.750 --> 00:04:02.400
it kinda jumps out at you,
you're starting at 168

00:04:02.400 --> 00:04:04.190
and you're multiplying by one half.

00:04:04.190 --> 00:04:06.581
Whatever term you are minus one times.

00:04:06.581 --> 00:04:09.220
But this is algebraically
equivalent to this,

00:04:09.220 --> 00:04:10.930
to our original one.

00:04:10.930 --> 00:04:13.850
But, can we also define
G of N recursively?

00:04:13.850 --> 00:04:17.050
And I encourage you to pause
the video and try to do that.

00:04:17.050 --> 00:04:19.010
In a lot of ways, the recursive definition

00:04:19.010 --> 00:04:20.690
is a little bit more straight
forward, so let's do that.

00:04:20.690 --> 00:04:23.890
G, well, I'll make the
recursive function a different,

00:04:23.890 --> 00:04:26.230
well, I got, I'll stick
with G of N since it's

00:04:26.230 --> 00:04:28.080
on this table right over here.

00:04:28.080 --> 00:04:33.030
G of N is equal to, and so, let's see,

00:04:33.030 --> 00:04:36.879
if we're going to, when N equals one,

00:04:36.879 --> 00:04:41.879
if N is equal to one,
we're starting at 168.

00:04:42.340 --> 00:04:47.340
168, and if N is greater than one

00:04:47.470 --> 00:04:49.790
and a whole number, so, if N, so,

00:04:49.790 --> 00:04:52.420
we're, this is gonna be defined
over all positive integers,

00:04:52.420 --> 00:04:56.080
and whole number, what are we gonna do?

00:04:56.479 --> 00:04:58.430
Well, we're gonna take
one half and multiply it

00:04:58.430 --> 00:05:00.080
times the previous term.

00:05:00.080 --> 00:05:05.080
So, it's gonna be one half
times G of N minus one.

00:05:06.172 --> 00:05:07.460
And you can verify that this works.

00:05:07.460 --> 00:05:09.690
If N is equal to one, we
just go right over here,

00:05:09.690 --> 00:05:11.300
it's gonna be 168.

00:05:11.300 --> 00:05:14.650
G of two is gonna be
one half times G of one,

00:05:14.650 --> 00:05:17.230
which is, of course, 168.

00:05:17.230 --> 00:05:19.180
so, 168 times one half is 84.

00:05:19.180 --> 00:05:22.680
G of three is gonna be
one half times G of two,

00:05:22.680 --> 00:05:26.930
which it is, G of three is
one half times G of two.

00:05:26.930 --> 00:05:28.730
So, this is how we would define,

00:05:28.730 --> 00:05:32.290
this is the explicit
definition of this sequence,

00:05:32.290 --> 00:05:36.450
this is a recursive function
to define this sequence.
