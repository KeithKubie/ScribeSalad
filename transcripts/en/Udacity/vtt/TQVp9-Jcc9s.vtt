00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.000
Let's assume we have two different ways to lose weight,

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:07.000
and we want to figure out which one is the most effective.

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:15.000
We have 10,000 people who received Treatment A. Their average loss is 10 pounds.

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:21.000
The standard deviation of their loss is also 10 pounds.

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:25.000
Let's consider a second treatment, Treatment B.

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:32.000
We also applied it to 10,000 people. Our average loss in this case was 20 pounds.

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:35.000
And we also have a standard deviation of 20 pounds.

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:42.000
Our null hypothesis of course is that weight loss from Treatment A equals

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:45.000
the average weight loss from Treatment B.

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:52.000
Our alternative hypothesis is if we are perhaps the providers of Treatment B

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:58.000
is that WB is greater than WA or alternatively that the difference is positive.

00:00:58.000 --> 09:59:59.000
With a 5% allowable false positive rate, which hypothesis do we choose to accept?
