00:00:07.123 --> 00:00:09.763
When a team of archaeologists
recently came across

00:00:09.763 --> 00:00:13.003
some 15,000 year-old human remains,

00:00:13.003 --> 00:00:15.293
they made an interesting discovery.

00:00:15.293 --> 00:00:19.122
The teeth of those ancient humans
were riddled with holes.

00:00:19.122 --> 00:00:23.942
Their cavities were caused by the same
thing that still plagues us today,

00:00:23.942 --> 00:00:28.124
specific tiny microbes 
that live in our mouths.

00:00:28.124 --> 00:00:30.512
These microbes are with us
soon after birth.

00:00:30.512 --> 00:00:34.313
We typically pick them up as babies
from our mothers' mouths.

00:00:34.313 --> 00:00:35.924
And as our teeth erupt,

00:00:35.924 --> 00:00:39.943
they naturally begin to accumulate
communities of bacteria.

00:00:39.943 --> 00:00:41.194
Depending on what we eat,

00:00:41.194 --> 00:00:43.621
and specifically how much sugar
we consume,

00:00:43.621 --> 00:00:48.493
certain microbes can overpopulate
and cause cavities.

00:00:48.493 --> 00:00:52.343
Diets high in sugary foods cause
an explosion of bacteria

00:00:52.343 --> 00:00:55.994
called mutans streptococci
in our mouths.

00:00:55.994 --> 00:00:58.874
Like humans, these microorganisms
love sugar,

00:00:58.874 --> 00:01:03.306
using it as a molecular building block
and energy source.

00:01:03.306 --> 00:01:04.653
As they consume it,

00:01:04.653 --> 00:01:07.944
the bacteria generate byproducts
in the form of acids,

00:01:07.944 --> 00:01:09.894
such as lactic acid.

00:01:09.894 --> 00:01:13.144
Mutans streptococci are resistant
to this acid,

00:01:13.144 --> 00:01:16.314
but unfortunately, our teeth aren't.

00:01:16.314 --> 00:01:20.404
While each human tooth is coated
in a hardy, protective layer of enamel,

00:01:20.404 --> 00:01:22.803
it's no match for acid.

00:01:22.803 --> 00:01:28.154
That degrades the armor over time,
leaching away its calcium minerals.

00:01:28.154 --> 00:01:31.575
Gradually, acid wears down a pathway
for bacteria

00:01:31.575 --> 00:01:35.576
into the tooth's secondary layer
called the dentin.

00:01:35.576 --> 00:01:40.195
Since blood vessels and nerves
in our teeth are enclosed deep within,

00:01:40.195 --> 00:01:43.875
at this stage, the expanding cavity
doesn't hurt.

00:01:43.875 --> 00:01:46.045
But if the damage extends 
beyond the dentin,

00:01:46.045 --> 00:01:48.376
the bacterial invasion progresses

00:01:48.376 --> 00:01:52.856
causing excruciating pain
as the nerves become exposed.

00:01:52.856 --> 00:01:55.665
Without treatment, the whole tooth
may become infected

00:01:55.665 --> 00:01:57.346
and require removal

00:01:57.346 --> 00:02:00.586
all due to those sugar-loving bacteria.

00:02:00.586 --> 00:02:02.505
The more sugar our food contains,

00:02:02.505 --> 00:02:04.895
the more our teeth are put at risk.

00:02:04.895 --> 00:02:09.826
Those cavemen would hardly
have indulged in sugary treats, however,

00:02:09.826 --> 00:02:11.977
so what caused their cavities?

00:02:11.977 --> 00:02:16.135
In meat-heavy diets, there would have
been a low-risk of cavities developing

00:02:16.135 --> 00:02:19.256
because lean meat 
contains very little sugar,

00:02:19.256 --> 00:02:22.285
but that's not all our early human
ancestors ate.

00:02:22.285 --> 00:02:27.285
Cavemen would also have consumed
root vegetables, nuts, and grains,

00:02:27.285 --> 00:02:29.830
all of which contain carbohydrates.

00:02:29.830 --> 00:02:32.027
When exposed to enzymes in the saliva,

00:02:32.027 --> 00:02:35.645
carbohydrates get broken down
into simpler sugars,

00:02:35.645 --> 00:02:40.105
which can become the fodder
for those ravenous mouth bacteria.

00:02:40.105 --> 00:02:44.376
So while ancient humans did eat
less sugar compared to us,

00:02:44.376 --> 00:02:47.392
their teeth were still exposed to sugars.

00:02:47.392 --> 00:02:50.666
That doesn't mean they were unable
to treat their cavities, though.

00:02:50.666 --> 00:02:54.638
Archaeological remains show that
about 14,000 years ago,

00:02:54.638 --> 00:03:00.549
humans were already using sharpened flint
to remove bits of rotten teeth.

00:03:00.549 --> 00:03:02.917
Ancient humans even made
rudimentary drills

00:03:02.917 --> 00:03:06.018
to smooth out the rough holes left behind

00:03:06.018 --> 00:03:10.369
and beeswax to plug cavities,
like modern-day fillings.

00:03:10.369 --> 00:03:13.387
Today, we have much more sophisticated
techniques and tools,

00:03:13.387 --> 00:03:17.877
which is fortunate because we also need
to contend with our more damaging,

00:03:17.877 --> 00:03:20.180
sugar-guzzling ways.

00:03:20.180 --> 00:03:24.559
After the Industrial Revolution,
the human incidence of cavities surged

00:03:24.559 --> 00:03:27.308
because suddenly 
we had technological advances

00:03:27.308 --> 00:03:31.209
that made refined sugar cheaper
and accessible.

00:03:31.209 --> 00:03:37.058
Today, an incredible 92% of American 
adults have had cavities in their teeth.

00:03:37.058 --> 00:03:39.947
Some people are more susceptible 
to cavities due to genes

00:03:39.947 --> 00:03:42.998
that may cause certain weaknesses,
like softer enamel,

00:03:42.998 --> 00:03:46.928
but for most, high sugar consumption
is to blame.

00:03:46.928 --> 00:03:50.218
However, we have developed other ways
of minimizing cavities

00:03:50.218 --> 00:03:53.750
besides reducing our intake of sugar
and starch.

00:03:53.750 --> 00:03:56.630
In most toothpastes 
and many water supplies,

00:03:56.630 --> 00:03:59.328
we use tiny amounts of fluoride.

00:03:59.328 --> 00:04:03.109
That strengthens teeth and encourages
the growth of enamel crystals

00:04:03.109 --> 00:04:06.470
that build up a tooth's defenses
against acid.

00:04:06.470 --> 00:04:08.020
When cavities do develop,

00:04:08.020 --> 00:04:11.909
we use tooth fillings to fill 
and close off the infected area,

00:04:11.909 --> 00:04:13.989
preventing them from getting worse.

00:04:13.989 --> 00:04:18.120
The best way to avoid a cavity
is still cutting down on sugar intake

00:04:18.120 --> 00:04:20.151
and practicing good oral hygiene

00:04:20.151 --> 00:04:23.051
to get rid of the bacteria 
and their food sources.

00:04:23.051 --> 00:04:24.900
That includes regular tooth brushing,

00:04:24.900 --> 00:04:25.909
flossing,

00:04:25.909 --> 00:04:27.160
and avoiding sugary,

00:04:27.160 --> 00:04:28.003
starchy,

00:04:28.003 --> 00:04:31.671
and sticky foods that cling to your teeth
between meals.

00:04:31.671 --> 00:04:36.050
Gradually, the population of sugar-loving
microbes in your mouth will decline.

00:04:36.050 --> 00:04:38.102
Unlike the cavemen of yesteryear,

00:04:38.102 --> 00:04:41.950
today we have the knowledge required
to avert a cavity calamity.

00:04:41.950 --> 00:04:43.700
We just need to use it.
