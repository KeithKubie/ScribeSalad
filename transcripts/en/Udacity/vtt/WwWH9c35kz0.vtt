00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.000
Yes, 0.4 is the product of these two values over here.

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:09.000
So, in reality the solution is just to apply the product p1  p2,

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:12.000
and hitting the 1 button gives me indeed 0.4.

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:17.000
I can now go and change this probability to 0.1 and 0.8.

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:22.000
You probably already figured out that the answer is now 0.08,

00:00:22.000 --> 99:59:59.000
and indeed, my code gives me the following result, 0.08.
