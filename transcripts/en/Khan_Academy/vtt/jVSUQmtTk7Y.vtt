00:00:00.500 --> 00:00:03.730
Let's talk a little bit about
the structure of the cell.

00:00:03.730 --> 00:00:05.680
I've done a lot
of videos where we

00:00:05.680 --> 00:00:07.550
deal with things that
go on inside of them,

00:00:07.550 --> 00:00:09.049
but I haven't done
one where we just

00:00:09.049 --> 00:00:11.060
talk about the entire
structure of them.

00:00:11.060 --> 00:00:14.740
So a good place to start is--
let me just draw the membrane.

00:00:14.740 --> 00:00:17.750
And the cellular membrane
is a good place to start,

00:00:17.750 --> 00:00:19.600
because this is what
separates the cell

00:00:19.600 --> 00:00:20.840
from the outside world.

00:00:20.840 --> 00:00:24.090
And to a large degree, it
kind of defines the cell.

00:00:24.090 --> 00:00:27.260
It defines it as this very,
very small compartment.

00:00:27.260 --> 00:00:29.380
That's where the
word cell came from.

00:00:29.380 --> 00:00:30.870
So let me label that.

00:00:30.870 --> 00:00:35.430
Cellular membrane.

00:00:35.430 --> 00:00:40.600
And all cells have
a cellular membrane.

00:00:40.600 --> 00:00:45.570
Now, if we think about maybe
the most important thing that

00:00:45.570 --> 00:00:49.270
defines a cell-- you've
probably seen in the DNA videos,

00:00:49.270 --> 00:00:52.150
and we'll talk about translation
and transcription and all that.

00:00:52.150 --> 00:00:55.510
But what defines what a
living organism is is its DNA,

00:00:55.510 --> 00:00:57.650
so all cells have
DNA inside of it.

00:00:57.650 --> 00:00:59.270
And I won't go into
the detail of how

00:00:59.270 --> 00:01:01.230
DNA defines what an organism is.

00:01:01.230 --> 00:01:03.740
I've done that in some
detail on the DNA videos,

00:01:03.740 --> 00:01:05.180
but all cells have DNA here.

00:01:05.180 --> 00:01:07.440
This is more of kind
of an anatomy of a cell

00:01:07.440 --> 00:01:09.500
video than necessarily
the function.

00:01:09.500 --> 00:01:11.250
But we'll go into the
function, because we

00:01:11.250 --> 00:01:13.041
need to know what these
different parts do.

00:01:13.041 --> 00:01:16.450
So right here, this is the DNA.

00:01:16.450 --> 00:01:18.540
And it's in its
chromatin form here.

00:01:18.540 --> 00:01:22.356
There's also little proteins
here, not in all organisms.

00:01:22.356 --> 00:01:23.980
But we're going to
stick to eukaryotes,

00:01:23.980 --> 00:01:25.938
and I'll talk a little
bit about the difference

00:01:25.938 --> 00:01:28.780
between eukaryotes and
prokaryotes in a second.

00:01:28.780 --> 00:01:30.030
But we have DNA.

00:01:30.030 --> 00:01:31.810
As I've drawn this
cell right now,

00:01:31.810 --> 00:01:36.740
this is pretty much any cell,
any cell in any animal or plant

00:01:36.740 --> 00:01:38.819
or whatever kingdom
could look like this.

00:01:38.819 --> 00:01:40.360
I haven't drawn a
lot of the details.

00:01:40.360 --> 00:01:43.430
I've just drawn the DNA
and the cellular membrane.

00:01:43.430 --> 00:01:47.510
Now, here is kind of the first
major division in the living

00:01:47.510 --> 00:01:50.810
world, or at least
from our point of view,

00:01:50.810 --> 00:01:54.520
or it seemed obvious,
is that some cells have

00:01:54.520 --> 00:01:58.410
a membrane around the DNA.

00:01:58.410 --> 00:02:01.040
So they'll have a membrane
around the DNA that

00:02:01.040 --> 00:02:04.280
separates the DNA and the
chromatin and everything that

00:02:04.280 --> 00:02:06.600
makes up the stuff
within the DNA,

00:02:06.600 --> 00:02:08.471
separates that from
the rest of the cell.

00:02:08.471 --> 00:02:09.679
And this is called a nucleus.

00:02:15.060 --> 00:02:16.730
And I said that's
a major division,

00:02:16.730 --> 00:02:18.760
because when some people
looked at some cells

00:02:18.760 --> 00:02:20.450
and they saw a nucleus
and other cells

00:02:20.450 --> 00:02:22.325
and they didn't see a
nucleus, they say, hey,

00:02:22.325 --> 00:02:24.470
this is a good way to
classify organisms.

00:02:24.470 --> 00:02:27.583
So they called the things
that had nucleuses eukaryotes.

00:02:30.530 --> 00:02:32.320
These have a nucleus.

00:02:32.320 --> 00:02:37.130
So as I've drawn this cell
right here, it is a eukaryote.

00:02:37.130 --> 00:02:39.500
Now, if you do not
have a nucleus,

00:02:39.500 --> 00:02:41.053
you are dealing
with a prokaryote.

00:02:46.370 --> 00:02:48.560
No nucleus.

00:02:48.560 --> 00:02:52.380
And examples of prokaryotes,
the two big groups of them,

00:02:52.380 --> 00:02:56.882
are bacteria and archaea.

00:02:56.882 --> 00:02:58.340
And archaea are
really interesting.

00:02:58.340 --> 00:03:01.040
We know very, very
little about them.

00:03:01.040 --> 00:03:03.892
They were originally thought
to be types of bacteria,

00:03:03.892 --> 00:03:05.600
but now people are
realizing that they're

00:03:05.600 --> 00:03:07.780
this whole completely
other group.

00:03:07.780 --> 00:03:11.440
And we've actually observed
a very small subset of them,

00:03:11.440 --> 00:03:13.170
so it's a very
fascinating group.

00:03:13.170 --> 00:03:16.190
And actually it turns out
that evolutionarily speaking,

00:03:16.190 --> 00:03:17.815
you shouldn't make
this division first.

00:03:17.815 --> 00:03:20.060
And it actually makes more
sense to divide things

00:03:20.060 --> 00:03:21.800
into eukaryotes.

00:03:21.800 --> 00:03:22.840
I'll just write that.

00:03:22.840 --> 00:03:27.220
Euk, bacteria, and archaea.

00:03:27.220 --> 00:03:29.090
You don't want to do
this division first.

00:03:29.090 --> 00:03:30.930
There are actually
three separate groups

00:03:30.930 --> 00:03:33.120
that you want to start
off with, archaea.

00:03:33.120 --> 00:03:35.592
We'll do that, we'll talk more
about this in future videos.

00:03:35.592 --> 00:03:37.550
But if you want to say
who was a nucleus, well,

00:03:37.550 --> 00:03:40.270
eukaryotes have a
nucleus by definition.

00:03:40.270 --> 00:03:41.820
Who does not have a nucleus?

00:03:41.820 --> 00:03:43.780
Well, the bacteria
and the archaea

00:03:43.780 --> 00:03:46.890
do not have nuclei,
just like that.

00:03:46.890 --> 00:03:49.640
But I'm going to focus on
eukaryotes, because they

00:03:49.640 --> 00:03:51.630
tend to be a little
bit more complex.

00:03:51.630 --> 00:03:53.260
They tend to be larger.

00:03:53.260 --> 00:03:56.380
And most of what we talk about,
at least in the videos so far,

00:03:56.380 --> 00:03:58.040
are dealing with eukaryotes.

00:03:58.040 --> 00:04:02.110
Eukaryotes include
plants, animals.

00:04:02.110 --> 00:04:02.850
We're animals.

00:04:02.850 --> 00:04:04.950
At least I am.

00:04:04.950 --> 00:04:07.150
Animals and fungi.

00:04:07.150 --> 00:04:10.290
And there are other
groups within eukaryotes,

00:04:10.290 --> 00:04:11.970
but these are the
ones that we normally

00:04:11.970 --> 00:04:14.510
deal with in our everyday world.

00:04:14.510 --> 00:04:16.920
Let's go back to looking
at the anatomy itself.

00:04:16.920 --> 00:04:18.100
So we have our DNA.

00:04:18.100 --> 00:04:21.680
We know that it gets
transcribed into mRNA.

00:04:21.680 --> 00:04:27.190
That mRNA leaves
the nucleus, and it

00:04:27.190 --> 00:04:32.530
gets translated into
proteins at the ribosomes.

00:04:32.530 --> 00:04:36.022
So the ribosomes are
these little complexes

00:04:36.022 --> 00:04:37.730
that could be floating
all over the cell,

00:04:37.730 --> 00:04:39.563
and we'll see in a
second that they can also

00:04:39.563 --> 00:04:42.254
be attached to these
other membrane structures.

00:04:42.254 --> 00:04:43.170
So this is a ribosome.

00:04:47.800 --> 00:04:50.510
And if all this talk
of DNA transcription

00:04:50.510 --> 00:04:53.270
into mRNA and mRNA
leaving the nucleus

00:04:53.270 --> 00:04:56.990
and traveling to the ribosome
to be translated into proteins

00:04:56.990 --> 00:04:59.579
makes no sense to you,
there are several videos

00:04:59.579 --> 00:05:00.870
where I go into that in detail.

00:05:00.870 --> 00:05:01.880
But what I want to
do is just focus on

00:05:01.880 --> 00:05:03.546
all of the different
parts, kind of give

00:05:03.546 --> 00:05:05.020
a big picture of things.

00:05:05.020 --> 00:05:10.390
So ribosomes are
where mRNA that gets

00:05:10.390 --> 00:05:13.450
transcribed inside
the nucleus from DNA

00:05:13.450 --> 00:05:18.970
where it gets translated
into proteins.

00:05:18.970 --> 00:05:20.680
So you can kind of
view them as a place

00:05:20.680 --> 00:05:23.290
where information actually
turns into proteins which

00:05:23.290 --> 00:05:26.610
then can be used anywhere
else in the cell.

00:05:26.610 --> 00:05:28.640
Now, one interesting--
and these ribosomes,

00:05:28.640 --> 00:05:29.880
they're made up of proteins.

00:05:29.880 --> 00:05:33.242
And actually, they're
made up of RNA.

00:05:33.242 --> 00:05:34.700
And so one question
is, well, where

00:05:34.700 --> 00:05:36.994
are the pieces of
the ribosomes made?

00:05:36.994 --> 00:05:38.660
Well, some of them
are made by proteins,

00:05:38.660 --> 00:05:40.680
which might be made
in other ribosomes.

00:05:40.680 --> 00:05:43.400
But some of it, the mRNA,
ribosomes, you can kind of

00:05:43.400 --> 00:05:48.010
view them as this big mass
if you were to look detailed.

00:05:48.010 --> 00:05:49.650
There's some protein there.

00:05:49.650 --> 00:05:51.400
And I'm not drawing
it that realistically,

00:05:51.400 --> 00:05:54.460
but then you have some mRNA
tied in with the protein.

00:05:54.460 --> 00:05:58.270
And the mRNA isn't used for
actual information purposes

00:05:58.270 --> 00:06:01.140
like it normally is when it
goes from DNA to the ribosome.

00:06:01.140 --> 00:06:04.760
Within the ribosome
itself, ribosomal RNA

00:06:04.760 --> 00:06:06.980
is actually used as
part of the structure.

00:06:06.980 --> 00:06:10.470
It actually helps the ribosome
function as a ribosome,

00:06:10.470 --> 00:06:12.550
so it's actually
part of the ribosome.

00:06:12.550 --> 00:06:19.780
And all of that gets built
in a part of the nucleus

00:06:19.780 --> 00:06:24.280
called the nucleolus
or the nucleole.

00:06:24.280 --> 00:06:26.240
Let me write that down.

00:06:26.240 --> 00:06:29.100
So this right here, this
is interesting right here.

00:06:29.100 --> 00:06:34.770
This is the nucleolus
or the nucleole.

00:06:34.770 --> 00:06:36.460
And it isn't a
separate organelle,

00:06:36.460 --> 00:06:38.140
and it's not separated
by a membrane.

00:06:38.140 --> 00:06:39.670
But it shows up in a microscope.

00:06:39.670 --> 00:06:41.810
So when people first saw that,
hey, there's like a bundle

00:06:41.810 --> 00:06:42.310
there.

00:06:42.310 --> 00:06:45.185
That must be like the core
of the nucleus or something.

00:06:45.185 --> 00:06:46.560
But it turns out
what it is, it's

00:06:46.560 --> 00:06:49.490
the densely packed--
you got DNA and RNA.

00:06:49.490 --> 00:06:52.380
And that's actually where the
ribosomal RNA, the stuff that

00:06:52.380 --> 00:06:55.130
makes up the ribosomes,
is actually produced.

00:06:55.130 --> 00:06:57.679
But it's so dense that it
shows up on a microscope,

00:06:57.679 --> 00:07:00.220
and that's why people decided
to name it something different.

00:07:00.220 --> 00:07:01.650
But it is not membrane bound.

00:07:01.650 --> 00:07:04.040
It's not an organelle
within an organelle.

00:07:04.040 --> 00:07:07.990
It's just densely packed
proteins and ribosomal RNA.

00:07:07.990 --> 00:07:11.970
It's where ribosomal
RNA gets produced.
