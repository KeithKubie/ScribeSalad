00:00:01.902 --> 00:00:04.605
is an even greater "The Nurses."

00:00:05.739 --> 00:00:07.541
Welcome to "The Nurses,"

00:00:07.641 --> 00:00:10.878
the show that you watch while
you're waiting for the doctors.

00:00:10.978 --> 00:00:12.312 line:0%
 
I know what
you're all thinking.

00:00:12.412 --> 00:00:14.081 line:0%
 
You want to see the doctors
right away,

00:00:14.181 --> 00:00:17.251 line:0%
 
but you're just going to have
to settle for the unsung heroes

00:00:17.351 --> 00:00:19.553 line:0%
 
up here who do
all the real work.

00:00:19.653 --> 00:00:22.155 line:0%
 
And don't worry, we know more
than the doctors, okay?

00:00:22.256 --> 00:00:23.657 line:0%
 
If you don't have a fever

00:00:23.757 --> 00:00:25.559 line:0%
 
and you blow your nose
and it's clear, you're fine.

00:00:25.659 --> 00:00:26.860 line:0%
 
That's right.

00:00:26.960 --> 00:00:29.062 line:0%
 
Because doctors can be
very unapproachable.

00:00:29.162 --> 00:00:30.697 line:0%
 
It's like, we get it,
Your Grace.

00:00:30.797 --> 00:00:31.999 line:0%
 
You're super busy.

00:00:32.099 --> 00:00:33.500 line:0%
 
And we're not busy?
Please.

00:00:33.600 --> 00:00:34.735 line:0%
 
Don't give us any attitude.

00:00:34.835 --> 00:00:36.570
If you are rude,
we're rude.

00:00:36.670 --> 00:00:38.005
We'll give it right back to you.

00:00:38.105 --> 00:00:40.407
(audience claps)
Thank you.

00:00:40.507 --> 00:00:44.044
Okay, let's take a question
from the studio audience.

00:00:44.144 --> 00:00:46.079
Yeah, thanks, hi.

00:00:46.180 --> 00:00:49.683
I've been told
that my cholesterol is--

00:00:49.783 --> 00:00:51.218
Step on the scale, please.

00:00:51.318 --> 00:00:54.188
Wow, okay.

00:00:54.288 --> 00:00:56.223
Uh, you want me
to remove my shoes?

00:00:56.323 --> 00:00:57.724
(all)
It doesn't matter.

00:00:59.560 --> 00:01:02.429
My cholesterol is too high.

00:01:02.529 --> 00:01:04.965
What can I do
to address this issue?

00:01:05.065 --> 00:01:06.400
I guess,
like, Google it?

00:01:06.500 --> 00:01:09.436
You know what,
you gotta wash your hands.

00:01:09.536 --> 00:01:11.805
And wash them longer
than you think, okay?

00:01:11.905 --> 00:01:13.607
Two "Happy Birthdays."

00:01:13.707 --> 00:01:15.876
A doctor would say that
my cholesterol is connected

00:01:15.976 --> 00:01:17.945
to washing my hands?

00:01:18.078 --> 00:01:19.613
I'll tell you what a doctor
would say.

00:01:19.713 --> 00:01:22.082
"Blah, blah, I want to bang
every pharmaceutical rep

00:01:22.182 --> 00:01:25.152
that walks through my office
door in a pencil skirt. Blah."

00:01:25.252 --> 00:01:26.887
That's what a doctor would say.
(audience claps)

00:01:26.987 --> 00:01:29.456
It's like, I wear
pencil skirts, you know?

00:01:29.556 --> 00:01:30.724
I wear 'em all the time,

00:01:30.824 --> 00:01:32.993
and I can't even Dr. Rosen
to look at me.

00:01:33.093 --> 00:01:36.430
Okay, this isn't really
the time for that.

00:01:36.530 --> 00:01:37.731
Thank you.

00:01:37.831 --> 00:01:40.300
Here.
Piss in this.

00:01:40.400 --> 00:01:43.136
Do you want me to leave it in
the bathroom or bring it out?

00:01:43.237 --> 00:01:44.805
(all)
Doesn't matter.

00:01:44.905 --> 00:01:47.341
I can't today.
I can't.

00:01:47.441 --> 00:01:49.142
Okay, we are getting a lot
of questions about

00:01:49.243 --> 00:01:51.011
keeping your doodies regular.

00:01:51.111 --> 00:01:52.913
Mm-hmm,
Here's what I do:

00:01:53.013 --> 00:01:55.482
Coffee and a cigarette.

00:01:55.582 --> 00:01:58.852
Boom, like clockwork every day.

00:01:58.952 --> 00:02:00.354
Easy, thank you.
(audience claps)

00:02:00.454 --> 00:02:02.656
You're welcome.

00:02:02.756 --> 00:02:05.158
Happy birthday,
Jocelyn!

00:02:05.259 --> 00:02:06.827
Oh, you guys.

00:02:06.927 --> 00:02:08.128
(Amy)
Jocie!

00:02:08.228 --> 00:02:10.364
A cookie cake!
Yeah.

00:02:10.464 --> 00:02:12.332
My favorite!

00:02:12.432 --> 00:02:14.168
We know you love cookie cake.

00:02:14.268 --> 00:02:15.502
Happy birthday.

00:02:15.602 --> 00:02:17.304
Everyone owes me $3.

00:02:17.404 --> 00:02:18.672
I'm actually not
going to have any.

00:02:18.772 --> 00:02:20.607
Even if you're not
gonna have any.

00:02:20.707 --> 00:02:23.477
It's a party, okay?

00:02:23.577 --> 00:02:25.746
Yeah, I have a question
about prescriptions?

00:02:25.846 --> 00:02:28.081
Sir, we will call you
when we're ready for you.

00:02:28.148 --> 00:02:30.984
Okay? I did not
forget about you.

00:02:31.084 --> 00:02:32.719
Sit down.

00:02:34.721 --> 00:02:36.123
(clears throat)

00:02:49.102 --> 00:02:51.171
Sir?

00:02:51.271 --> 00:02:52.706
Sir!

00:02:52.806 --> 00:02:53.774
We're ready for you now.

00:02:53.874 --> 00:02:55.542
Even though we're
technically still on break.

00:02:55.642 --> 00:02:57.744
What's your <i>emergency</i> question?

00:02:57.845 --> 00:02:59.479
My question is about
prescriptions.

00:02:59.580 --> 00:03:00.848
Step on the scale.

00:03:00.948 --> 00:03:02.816
Is she talking to the air?
Step on it.

00:03:02.916 --> 00:03:05.052
Ahh!

00:03:05.152 --> 00:03:06.753
Oh, no!

00:03:06.854 --> 00:03:09.923
(screaming)

00:03:10.057 --> 00:03:11.225
Oh, God!

00:03:11.325 --> 00:03:12.759
My legs are cut off!

00:03:12.860 --> 00:03:15.095
Someone, please,
call the doctors!

00:03:15.195 --> 00:03:16.363
Call the doctors!

00:03:16.463 --> 00:03:18.232
Uh.
He's gonna die on television!

00:03:18.332 --> 00:03:20.400
Someone get a doctor!

00:03:20.501 --> 00:03:21.668
Look at his legs!

00:03:21.768 --> 00:03:22.903
It's in half!

00:03:23.070 --> 00:03:24.838
Both legs are in half!

00:03:24.938 --> 00:03:26.073
Dr. Patel?

00:03:26.173 --> 00:03:27.341
Oh, what a shocker.

00:03:27.441 --> 00:03:28.575
Well, can somebody go find him?
