ERIN SCHAEFER: Good
morning, everybody.

00:00:04.870 --> 00:00:06.110
I'm Erin Schaefer.

00:00:06.110 --> 00:00:09.050
I work on our global brand
solutions team, a part

00:00:09.050 --> 00:00:10.629
of the broader YouTube crew.

00:00:10.629 --> 00:00:12.420
Let me tell you a little
bit about Arianna.

00:00:12.420 --> 00:00:15.300
I'm sure many of you
already know a lot of this.

00:00:15.300 --> 00:00:19.500
But Arianna is the co-founder,
president, and editor-in-chief

00:00:19.500 --> 00:00:21.390
of Huffington Post Media Group.

00:00:21.390 --> 00:00:23.920
She launched the
Huffington Post in 2005

00:00:23.920 --> 00:00:26.530
and in 2012 the site
won a Pulitzer--

00:00:26.530 --> 00:00:28.410
the first for a
digital media company--

00:00:28.410 --> 00:00:31.130
incredibly impressive-- for
their national reporting.

00:00:31.130 --> 00:00:32.750
Arianna also, in
all her free time,

00:00:32.750 --> 00:00:33.970
has been a very busy author.

00:00:33.970 --> 00:00:36.010
She's the author of 15 books.

00:00:36.010 --> 00:00:38.027
And her 15th, and most
recent, that we're

00:00:38.027 --> 00:00:39.610
going to talk a
little bit about today

00:00:39.610 --> 00:00:43.190
is "The Sleep Revolution," which
is about the science, history

00:00:43.190 --> 00:00:44.780
and mystery of sleep.

00:00:44.780 --> 00:00:46.992
And I know we'll
dig into that a bit.

00:00:46.992 --> 00:00:48.450
You also probably
know that Arianna

00:00:48.450 --> 00:00:51.140
has been named to "Time"
magazine's list of the 100

00:00:51.140 --> 00:00:54.300
most influential people and
the Forbes most powerful women

00:00:54.300 --> 00:00:55.040
list.

00:00:55.040 --> 00:00:57.140
She's on numerous boards,
including the Center

00:00:57.140 --> 00:00:59.300
for Public Integrity and Uber.

00:00:59.300 --> 00:01:01.121
And she's also
originally from Greece,

00:01:01.121 --> 00:01:02.620
having moved to
England when she was

00:01:02.620 --> 00:01:07.080
16, where she graduated from
Cambridge with a masters--

00:01:07.080 --> 00:01:09.040
an MA in economics.

00:01:09.040 --> 00:01:11.211
And again, I've only had
the pleasure of meeting her

00:01:11.211 --> 00:01:13.210
just this morning, but I
already feel that we're

00:01:13.210 --> 00:01:15.240
close friends after 15 minutes.

00:01:15.240 --> 00:01:17.340
She's a very, very
special person.

00:01:17.340 --> 00:01:20.100
With that, Arianna,
please come on up.

00:01:22.737 --> 00:01:23.691
How about a hug?

00:01:30.570 --> 00:01:32.719
Thank you so much
for joining us here.

00:01:32.719 --> 00:01:33.760
I'm thrilled to have you.

00:01:33.760 --> 00:01:34.310
ARIANNA HUFFINGTON: I'm
just thrilled to be here.

00:01:34.310 --> 00:01:36.560
And I'm so happy
that everybody seems

00:01:36.560 --> 00:01:38.910
to be getting a copy of
"The Sleep Revolution."

00:01:38.910 --> 00:01:40.380
ERIN SCHAEFER: Yes.

00:01:40.380 --> 00:01:43.470
We're sorry not everybody
on GVD can do that,

00:01:43.470 --> 00:01:46.310
but you, too, should
get a copy of the book.

00:01:46.310 --> 00:01:48.344
What I'll do is I'll
ask you a few questions

00:01:48.344 --> 00:01:50.010
and then I'll open
it up to our audience

00:01:50.010 --> 00:01:52.218
here, and then the many
people who've asked questions

00:01:52.218 --> 00:01:54.314
from around the
globe on our Dory.

00:01:54.314 --> 00:01:55.480
But let me get started here.

00:01:55.480 --> 00:01:57.800
And I'd love to start with
this book and "The Sleep

00:01:57.800 --> 00:01:59.220
Revolution."

00:01:59.220 --> 00:02:01.300
Can you tell us a bit
about your motivation

00:02:01.300 --> 00:02:04.595
for writing a book about sleep?

00:02:04.595 --> 00:02:05.970
ARIANNA HUFFINGTON:
My motivation

00:02:05.970 --> 00:02:09.789
was that I actually collapsed
from sleep deprivation.

00:02:09.789 --> 00:02:13.950
And on my way down,
broke my cheekbone

00:02:13.950 --> 00:02:15.830
on a corner of my desk.

00:02:15.830 --> 00:02:19.420
And as I came to,
in a pool of blood,

00:02:19.420 --> 00:02:23.010
I had to ask myself the
question, if you come

00:02:23.010 --> 00:02:25.460
to in a pool of blood
and nobody has shot you,

00:02:25.460 --> 00:02:27.380
is that really what
success looks like?

00:02:30.230 --> 00:02:35.980
And that led to a book I wrote
two years ago, called "Thrive."

00:02:35.980 --> 00:02:39.870
And in "Thrive,"
sleep is a tiny part.

00:02:39.870 --> 00:02:41.920
And as I went around
the world, speaking

00:02:41.920 --> 00:02:45.710
about redefining success
and including our well-being

00:02:45.710 --> 00:02:50.440
and sense of wonder and giving
into the definition, what

00:02:50.440 --> 00:02:54.910
people really wanted to
talk about was sleep.

00:02:54.910 --> 00:02:57.310
Because we share it.

00:02:57.310 --> 00:03:01.240
It's like it's the universal
common denominator.

00:03:01.240 --> 00:03:05.050
You may not want to
meditate or wonder or give,

00:03:05.050 --> 00:03:07.230
but you have to sleep.

00:03:07.230 --> 00:03:13.590
So I decided to dig deep
and make the book very much

00:03:13.590 --> 00:03:17.020
based on all the latest
science about sleep.

00:03:17.020 --> 00:03:18.370
Because it's kind of amazing.

00:03:18.370 --> 00:03:21.120
Sleep is a very new science.

00:03:21.120 --> 00:03:24.620
In fact, the first
scientific sleep center

00:03:24.620 --> 00:03:28.290
was founded here at
Stanford in 1970.

00:03:28.290 --> 00:03:31.550
And now there are over
2,500 in the US alone.

00:03:31.550 --> 00:03:33.770
And the conclusion--
as you'll see,

00:03:33.770 --> 00:03:36.960
there are 1,200 scientific
footnotes in the book.

00:03:36.960 --> 00:03:38.930
You don't have to
actually read them,

00:03:38.930 --> 00:03:41.350
but if you have a
partner or a friend who

00:03:41.350 --> 00:03:45.560
is skeptical about sleep,
you can make them read them.

00:03:45.560 --> 00:03:49.220
Because it's kind of
unequivocal and conclusive.

00:03:49.220 --> 00:03:53.410
The science is saying
sleep is not negotiable.

00:03:53.410 --> 00:03:56.470
And it's not something
you can choose

00:03:56.470 --> 00:04:00.380
to do or not do unless you
have a genetic mutation.

00:04:00.380 --> 00:04:04.160
About 1% of the population
has a genetic mutation

00:04:04.160 --> 00:04:07.720
and they can do great on
four and five hours' sleep.

00:04:07.720 --> 00:04:10.450
I don't have that
genetic mutation.

00:04:10.450 --> 00:04:15.490
And you cannot train yourself
to have a genetic mutation.

00:04:15.490 --> 00:04:19.304
But there is actually a choice
before your children are born.

00:04:19.304 --> 00:04:21.720
You have two children, but if
you want to have a third one

00:04:21.720 --> 00:04:24.160
and you want them to
be a short sleeper--

00:04:24.160 --> 00:04:26.620
I don't know why you
would, but if you--

00:04:26.620 --> 00:04:31.490
you can do gene editing
before the baby is born.

00:04:31.490 --> 00:04:34.140
Once the baby is
born, the die is cast.

00:04:34.140 --> 00:04:34.880
That's it.

00:04:34.880 --> 00:04:36.480
Seven to nine hours.

00:04:36.480 --> 00:04:38.970
Where you are in
that spectrum is

00:04:38.970 --> 00:04:42.110
individual, but seven to nine.

00:04:42.110 --> 00:04:44.310
ERIN SCHAEFER: What is
the revolution itself?

00:04:44.310 --> 00:04:45.726
ARIANNA HUFFINGTON:
The revolution

00:04:45.726 --> 00:04:47.330
is really changing the culture.

00:04:47.330 --> 00:04:50.960
Because we are all living
under the collective delusion--

00:04:50.960 --> 00:04:53.660
and you experience
it more than anyone,

00:04:53.660 --> 00:04:59.640
here in the valley--
that in order to succeed,

00:04:59.640 --> 00:05:01.970
you have to burn out.

00:05:01.970 --> 00:05:03.720
That's the delusion
of our culture.

00:05:03.720 --> 00:05:07.150
You go into companies and you
see people being congratulated

00:05:07.150 --> 00:05:11.620
for working 24/7,
people wear being busy

00:05:11.620 --> 00:05:14.340
like a badge of honor.

00:05:14.340 --> 00:05:16.570
People say, she's amazing.

00:05:16.570 --> 00:05:18.070
She's always on.

00:05:18.070 --> 00:05:21.820
She returns texts and
emails right away.

00:05:21.820 --> 00:05:23.240
And we need to change that.

00:05:23.240 --> 00:05:28.400
We need to change how we
hear something like that.

00:05:28.400 --> 00:05:32.920
Now if I hear someone
say, she's amazing.

00:05:32.920 --> 00:05:33.970
She's always on.

00:05:33.970 --> 00:05:36.860
I think, that's a problem.

00:05:36.860 --> 00:05:40.170
And it's a problem
on many levels.

00:05:40.170 --> 00:05:43.620
It's a problem because at some
point, that someone on person

00:05:43.620 --> 00:05:46.560
is going to burn
out, mathematically.

00:05:46.560 --> 00:05:49.570
And the form the
burnout takes will vary.

00:05:49.570 --> 00:05:50.960
It can be a collapse like mine.

00:05:50.960 --> 00:05:53.342
It can be a health issue.

00:05:53.342 --> 00:05:56.080
It can be any number of things.

00:05:56.080 --> 00:05:59.124
Even a lot of the accidents
that happen that we think

00:05:59.124 --> 00:06:01.540
are accidents are really because
our immune system is down

00:06:01.540 --> 00:06:06.100
or we're not paying
attention, et cetera.

00:06:06.100 --> 00:06:12.330
And the other thing is
that this whole building

00:06:12.330 --> 00:06:14.670
is like a celebration
of creativity.

00:06:14.670 --> 00:06:18.900
YouTube is a
celebration of creators.

00:06:18.900 --> 00:06:20.930
The first thing
that gets degraded

00:06:20.930 --> 00:06:24.840
if you're sleep-deprived
is your creativity.

00:06:24.840 --> 00:06:26.720
You can still be
a transactional.

00:06:26.720 --> 00:06:31.190
You can still go to
meetings and pay attention

00:06:31.190 --> 00:06:36.270
with half your brain and
make notes and show up.

00:06:36.270 --> 00:06:39.440
But really, the part of
you that really comes up

00:06:39.440 --> 00:06:43.090
with innovative,
game-changing ideas-- which

00:06:43.090 --> 00:06:48.570
is why you are all about--
is not functioning as well.

00:06:48.570 --> 00:06:54.410
So we need to rethink our
whole idea of what it means

00:06:54.410 --> 00:06:57.780
to be optimally performing.

00:06:57.780 --> 00:06:58.950
And you know what I love?

00:06:58.950 --> 00:07:03.630
That athletes, who are all
about performance and winning,

00:07:03.630 --> 00:07:07.710
are now prioritizing sleep
and renewal and recharging.

00:07:07.710 --> 00:07:10.300
I write a lot about Andre
Iguodala in the book

00:07:10.300 --> 00:07:14.470
because he actually tracked
his stats after he started

00:07:14.470 --> 00:07:16.400
getting eight hours' sleep.

00:07:16.400 --> 00:07:19.470
And it's just amazing to
see the immediate impact

00:07:19.470 --> 00:07:20.390
on performance.

00:07:20.390 --> 00:07:23.270
So sleep as a
performance enhancer.

00:07:23.270 --> 00:07:25.830
Now sleep is a lot
more than that.

00:07:25.830 --> 00:07:29.590
But I don't really care why
you start getting enough sleep.

00:07:29.590 --> 00:07:32.970
Whatever your entry
point is, take it.

00:07:32.970 --> 00:07:35.980
One of the lines in
the book is "come

00:07:35.980 --> 00:07:39.070
for the performance-enhancing
benefits,

00:07:39.070 --> 00:07:42.280
stay for the
life-enhancing benefits."

00:07:42.280 --> 00:07:44.900
And for me, the biggest
life-enhancing benefit

00:07:44.900 --> 00:07:49.380
is actually bringing joy
into what you're doing.

00:07:49.380 --> 00:07:51.290
Because I feel we're
all so blessed--

00:07:51.290 --> 00:07:55.170
we have jobs we love--
to be living here.

00:07:55.170 --> 00:07:59.750
And so often, I know for
myself, when I'm sleep-deprived,

00:07:59.750 --> 00:08:04.300
I may still get things
done, but the joy is gone.

00:08:04.300 --> 00:08:06.170
I drag myself through the day.

00:08:06.170 --> 00:08:09.100
I just go through the motions.

00:08:09.100 --> 00:08:11.329
But I'm not really in it.

00:08:11.329 --> 00:08:12.120
ERIN SCHAEFER: Yes.

00:08:12.120 --> 00:08:14.230
You're sleepwalking
through life,

00:08:14.230 --> 00:08:17.240
but not really experiencing it.

00:08:17.240 --> 00:08:19.010
I want to talk a
little bit about media,

00:08:19.010 --> 00:08:21.426
so I want to go back to a time
when you certainly were not

00:08:21.426 --> 00:08:24.240
sleepwalking through anything,
when you started the Huffington

00:08:24.240 --> 00:08:25.620
Post.

00:08:25.620 --> 00:08:27.510
You started it in 2005.

00:08:27.510 --> 00:08:30.620
What do you think led it to
become so successful, when

00:08:30.620 --> 00:08:33.039
there were already a lot of
other online news platforms

00:08:33.039 --> 00:08:33.350
out there?

00:08:33.350 --> 00:08:34.891
What was it about
the Huffington Post

00:08:34.891 --> 00:08:36.502
that attracted so many readers?

00:08:36.502 --> 00:08:37.960
ARIANNA HUFFINGTON:
I think what it

00:08:37.960 --> 00:08:41.030
was is really what is at
the heart of YouTube, which

00:08:41.030 --> 00:08:43.610
is that we are a platform,
from the beginning.

00:08:43.610 --> 00:08:46.320
Yes, we're also a
journalistic enterprise

00:08:46.320 --> 00:08:48.685
that, a few years
later, won a Pulitzer

00:08:48.685 --> 00:08:54.000
and we now have 850 journalists,
editors, in 16 countries.

00:08:54.000 --> 00:08:57.650
But the fact that we were a
platform where people could

00:08:57.650 --> 00:09:01.870
come and create--
tell their stories

00:09:01.870 --> 00:09:05.520
and share them-- was really
what differentiated us

00:09:05.520 --> 00:09:07.050
from the beginning.

00:09:07.050 --> 00:09:13.600
And that we did that, not as a
free-for-all, but making sure

00:09:13.600 --> 00:09:16.550
that the best thing's
got the most attention

00:09:16.550 --> 00:09:20.040
and that there was no
hierarchy, except is

00:09:20.040 --> 00:09:24.630
this really worth amplifying?

00:09:24.630 --> 00:09:27.090
Is this worth sharing?

00:09:27.090 --> 00:09:30.510
Whether it was President
Obama or a homeless student

00:09:30.510 --> 00:09:33.810
with something interesting to
say, which actually happened.

00:09:33.810 --> 00:09:37.850
And that homeless student
wrote a beautiful blog post

00:09:37.850 --> 00:09:40.630
which happened to be seen by
the Harvard admissions office

00:09:40.630 --> 00:09:43.180
and he's now in his
third year at Harvard.

00:09:43.180 --> 00:09:45.550
So immediately,
you saw the magic

00:09:45.550 --> 00:09:49.460
of what was happening in
this digital revolution--

00:09:49.460 --> 00:09:51.750
that people were discovered.

00:09:51.750 --> 00:09:55.020
Look at all the stars
that YouTube has created.

00:09:55.020 --> 00:09:59.840
Where would they be were
it not for this platform?

00:09:59.840 --> 00:10:02.980
Yeah, they might get
an agent in Hollywood,

00:10:02.980 --> 00:10:05.530
but now you don't need
an agent in Hollywood.

00:10:05.530 --> 00:10:07.400
You don't need a publisher.

00:10:07.400 --> 00:10:09.410
You can actually be
your own publisher

00:10:09.410 --> 00:10:12.025
and you can be your own creator
and you can be discovered.

00:10:12.025 --> 00:10:13.400
ERIN SCHAEFER:
Yes, I think there

00:10:13.400 --> 00:10:15.890
are a lot of similarities
between the Huffington

00:10:15.890 --> 00:10:17.190
Post as a platform and YouTube.

00:10:17.190 --> 00:10:19.150
And it is all about
just giving people

00:10:19.150 --> 00:10:21.420
a chance to have their voice.

00:10:21.420 --> 00:10:24.710
Obviously, looking
backwards to 2005,

00:10:24.710 --> 00:10:27.370
a lot has changed in
the media industry.

00:10:27.370 --> 00:10:30.210
What have you noticed
over the last-- not just

00:10:30.210 --> 00:10:32.680
those 10 years-- but your
history in the media industry?

00:10:32.680 --> 00:10:34.420
And what do you think
is going to happen

00:10:34.420 --> 00:10:36.609
next, in the next five
to 10 years in media?

00:10:36.609 --> 00:10:38.650
ARIANNA HUFFINGTON: I
think what's happening now,

00:10:38.650 --> 00:10:42.640
as you know, is that
there's so much.

00:10:42.640 --> 00:10:44.670
There's so many platforms.

00:10:44.670 --> 00:10:49.250
There is so much noise that
I think what is happening,

00:10:49.250 --> 00:10:50.950
and what's going to
become increasingly

00:10:50.950 --> 00:10:55.310
important in the next
few years, is are you

00:10:55.310 --> 00:10:58.660
adding value to people's lives?

00:10:58.660 --> 00:11:02.780
And at Huff Post, we've
taken that to heart.

00:11:02.780 --> 00:11:04.920
And we've divided
everything we're doing

00:11:04.920 --> 00:11:06.990
into three editorial pillars.

00:11:06.990 --> 00:11:09.160
The first is, obviously,
news and politics,

00:11:09.160 --> 00:11:11.470
but with our own perspective.

00:11:11.470 --> 00:11:14.340
We're not covering this
election the way others are

00:11:14.340 --> 00:11:15.970
covering this election.

00:11:15.970 --> 00:11:19.600
From day one, we refused
to treat Donald Trump

00:11:19.600 --> 00:11:20.775
as a normal candidate.

00:11:26.480 --> 00:11:29.590
We feel this is very
important for journalists

00:11:29.590 --> 00:11:33.650
not to buy into the idea that
our job is to be in the middle

00:11:33.650 --> 00:11:36.344
and present you two
sides to the story.

00:11:36.344 --> 00:11:37.260
Because you know what?

00:11:37.260 --> 00:11:40.530
Not everything has two sides.

00:11:40.530 --> 00:11:42.810
Evolution is a fact.

00:11:42.810 --> 00:11:45.290
The earth is not flat.

00:11:45.290 --> 00:11:48.058
Barack Obama was born
in the United States.

00:11:50.790 --> 00:11:52.280
Global warming is real.

00:11:54.800 --> 00:11:56.930
And yet, far too
many journalists

00:11:56.930 --> 00:11:58.550
are having these
conversations where

00:11:58.550 --> 00:12:00.060
you have a scientist
who believes

00:12:00.060 --> 00:12:03.660
in global warming debating
a scientist who doesn't, as

00:12:03.660 --> 00:12:05.980
though this is a
legitimate debate.

00:12:05.980 --> 00:12:08.840
So from day one,
when Donald Trump

00:12:08.840 --> 00:12:11.880
decided he's running
for president,

00:12:11.880 --> 00:12:20.520
we started covering him in
the entertainment section,

00:12:20.520 --> 00:12:23.720
on the grounds that-- as Seth
Meyers said at the White House

00:12:23.720 --> 00:12:28.372
Correspondents' Dinner in 2011,
when Donald Trump first said

00:12:28.372 --> 00:12:29.580
he was running for president.

00:12:29.580 --> 00:12:32.660
He said, I just heard that
Donald Trump is running

00:12:32.660 --> 00:12:34.280
for president as a Republican.

00:12:34.280 --> 00:12:36.544
I thought he was running
for president as a joke.

00:12:39.720 --> 00:12:42.710
The day that he
actually pronounced

00:12:42.710 --> 00:12:48.460
this policy of banning
1.6 billion Muslims

00:12:48.460 --> 00:12:51.040
from this country, we
stopped covering him

00:12:51.040 --> 00:12:53.730
in the entertainment
section and we cover him

00:12:53.730 --> 00:12:57.010
as a clear and present
danger to this country.

00:12:57.010 --> 00:12:58.930
And at the end of
every story that

00:12:58.930 --> 00:13:04.070
mentions him, there
is an editor's note

00:13:04.070 --> 00:13:08.780
that says, we want to remind our
readers that Donald Trump wants

00:13:08.780 --> 00:13:10.940
to ban an entire religion
from this country,

00:13:10.940 --> 00:13:15.060
is regularly inciting
violence, is a serial sexist

00:13:15.060 --> 00:13:18.460
misogynist and
xenophobe who does not

00:13:18.460 --> 00:13:20.540
believe that the President
of the United States

00:13:20.540 --> 00:13:21.920
was born here.

00:13:21.920 --> 00:13:23.430
And this is our job.

00:13:23.430 --> 00:13:28.700
Our job is to keep
reminding voters who he is.

00:13:28.700 --> 00:13:31.750
Voters will do whatever they're
going to do in November.

00:13:31.750 --> 00:13:35.670
But it cannot be because the
media have not done their job.

00:13:35.670 --> 00:13:38.670
As you can see, the way we
approach our politics and news

00:13:38.670 --> 00:13:40.840
pillar is very different.

00:13:40.840 --> 00:13:43.980
The second pillar is
covering solutions.

00:13:43.980 --> 00:13:46.110
We think there is
way too much coverage

00:13:46.110 --> 00:13:47.300
of problems and crisis.

00:13:47.300 --> 00:13:49.270
And obviously, we cover those.

00:13:49.270 --> 00:13:52.260
But there is an amazing amount
of good happening in the world.

00:13:52.260 --> 00:13:55.380
There is an amazing amount
of innovation and creativity

00:13:55.380 --> 00:13:57.040
and compassion.

00:13:57.040 --> 00:13:59.020
And we need to cover
those things, too.

00:13:59.020 --> 00:14:02.030
So we have a big editorial
department called

00:14:02.030 --> 00:14:04.000
What's Working?

00:14:04.000 --> 00:14:07.090
And at the heart of that
is also encouraging people

00:14:07.090 --> 00:14:08.020
to take action.

00:14:08.020 --> 00:14:10.590
And Susan and I have
been talking about that,

00:14:10.590 --> 00:14:13.380
how there's so much
amazing stuff on YouTube

00:14:13.380 --> 00:14:17.220
and how can we encourage people
immediately to take action?

00:14:17.220 --> 00:14:20.410
Because sometimes
you watch a video

00:14:20.410 --> 00:14:22.800
and you feel compelled
to do something

00:14:22.800 --> 00:14:24.250
and then life intervenes.

00:14:24.250 --> 00:14:25.990
If you don't do it
right away, it's

00:14:25.990 --> 00:14:27.180
going to be harder to do it.

00:14:27.180 --> 00:14:30.850
So we're working with
Crowdrise, and we're

00:14:30.850 --> 00:14:34.430
working with Jordan Hewson's
Action Button and the Global

00:14:34.430 --> 00:14:38.400
Poverty Project Button to
make all these stories more

00:14:38.400 --> 00:14:39.380
actionable.

00:14:39.380 --> 00:14:41.620
And the third thing
is all our initiatives

00:14:41.620 --> 00:14:45.720
around wellness and reducing
burnout and all the things

00:14:45.720 --> 00:14:47.800
that we've been discussing
in the first part

00:14:47.800 --> 00:14:49.710
of our conversation.

00:14:49.710 --> 00:14:51.860
ERIN SCHAEFER: Do
you think the way

00:14:51.860 --> 00:14:54.530
that Huff Post and
others will deliver

00:14:54.530 --> 00:14:57.070
that content--
interact with viewers

00:14:57.070 --> 00:14:59.614
and readers of that
content-- will that change?

00:14:59.614 --> 00:15:01.780
What do you see happening
in the next 5 to 10 years,

00:15:01.780 --> 00:15:05.370
in terms of how the media works
and how consumers of the media

00:15:05.370 --> 00:15:06.480
interact with it?

00:15:06.480 --> 00:15:07.855
ARIANNA HUFFINGTON:
Well, I think

00:15:07.855 --> 00:15:09.740
what's been happening
is going to accelerate.

00:15:09.740 --> 00:15:12.930
And of course, you are right
in the middle of these changes.

00:15:12.930 --> 00:15:16.420
More and more of this content is
going to be consumed on mobile.

00:15:16.420 --> 00:15:19.970
More and more of it
is going to be video.

00:15:19.970 --> 00:15:25.380
And more and more of it is going
to come to readers and viewers

00:15:25.380 --> 00:15:27.150
through the back door.

00:15:27.150 --> 00:15:30.310
Instead of them
going to a site, it's

00:15:30.310 --> 00:15:34.590
going to be because their
friends are sharing it

00:15:34.590 --> 00:15:38.270
or some other social
action that makes

00:15:38.270 --> 00:15:40.590
them aware of that content.

00:15:40.590 --> 00:15:42.280
And we see that at
the Huffington Post.

00:15:42.280 --> 00:15:47.100
I think the Huffington Post's
probably the last major media

00:15:47.100 --> 00:15:50.100
site that still has
destination traffic.

00:15:50.100 --> 00:15:53.280
But we see it
declining every year.

00:15:53.280 --> 00:15:58.100
We've actually focused more
on our off-platform traffic,

00:15:58.100 --> 00:16:02.670
on the grounds that ubiquity
is the new exclusivity,

00:16:02.670 --> 00:16:04.210
is what we're saying.

00:16:04.210 --> 00:16:07.580
It's not really about
exclusive content.

00:16:07.580 --> 00:16:09.540
We love partnerships.

00:16:09.540 --> 00:16:12.140
We love crossposting
both letting

00:16:12.140 --> 00:16:14.800
others crosspost our
content and crossposting

00:16:14.800 --> 00:16:16.470
the content of others.

00:16:16.470 --> 00:16:20.340
I think all these trends
that are already present

00:16:20.340 --> 00:16:21.357
are going to accelerate.

00:16:21.357 --> 00:16:23.940
ERIN SCHAEFER: Being where the
people are and making it easy--

00:16:23.940 --> 00:16:24.240
ARIANNA HUFFINGTON: Exactly.

00:16:24.240 --> 00:16:25.906
ERIN SCHAEFER: --for
them to get to you.

00:16:25.906 --> 00:16:27.860
ARIANNA HUFFINGTON:
And then, also,

00:16:27.860 --> 00:16:30.890
shaping the content in ways
appropriate for whatever

00:16:30.890 --> 00:16:33.410
platform you're going
to see the content.

00:16:33.410 --> 00:16:35.300
ERIN SCHAEFER: Makes
a lot of sense.

00:16:35.300 --> 00:16:38.640
Getting back to the news
pillar just for a moment,

00:16:38.640 --> 00:16:41.010
I would wonder, what would
you tell a young person

00:16:41.010 --> 00:16:44.830
today who is interested in
getting into journalism?

00:16:44.830 --> 00:16:46.750
ARIANNA HUFFINGTON:
I would say go for it

00:16:46.750 --> 00:16:51.960
and don't even wait to
go to journalism school.

00:16:51.960 --> 00:16:55.030
Just start where you
are because journalism

00:16:55.030 --> 00:17:00.810
has so dramatically changed that
it's really about the stories

00:17:00.810 --> 00:17:01.530
you tell.

00:17:01.530 --> 00:17:05.940
And then using the amazing
technology available

00:17:05.940 --> 00:17:07.930
to tell these stories
with more impact.

00:17:07.930 --> 00:17:11.460
We just bought a VR
company called RYOT.

00:17:11.460 --> 00:17:16.050
And the reason we chose
them is because they

00:17:16.050 --> 00:17:20.500
care about the
stories having impact

00:17:20.500 --> 00:17:22.300
and not just using
the technology

00:17:22.300 --> 00:17:29.270
to make it all beautiful
and appealing to people.

00:17:29.270 --> 00:17:31.550
And in the same
sense, if you want

00:17:31.550 --> 00:17:35.550
to go into journalism to have an
impact-- whether the impact is

00:17:35.550 --> 00:17:39.550
in politics or
entertainment or any field--

00:17:39.550 --> 00:17:41.719
this is the golden
age of journalism.

00:17:41.719 --> 00:17:43.260
ERIN SCHAEFER: So
news still matters.

00:17:43.260 --> 00:17:45.430
And in fact, you have more
tools, as a journalist,

00:17:45.430 --> 00:17:47.481
available to you
than ever before.

00:17:47.481 --> 00:17:47.980
OK.

00:17:47.980 --> 00:17:49.440
Thank you.

00:17:49.440 --> 00:17:54.340
I want to turn to some
questions about leadership.

00:17:54.340 --> 00:17:56.360
You have been
phenomenally successful

00:17:56.360 --> 00:17:58.780
in such a variety
of different areas.

00:17:58.780 --> 00:18:01.310
But I'm sure, along
with everybody else,

00:18:01.310 --> 00:18:05.070
you've had a lot of lessons
along the way from setbacks,

00:18:05.070 --> 00:18:05.990
et cetera.

00:18:05.990 --> 00:18:08.320
Can you tell us about some
of the lessons that you've

00:18:08.320 --> 00:18:10.630
learned, both from the
success and from times

00:18:10.630 --> 00:18:14.100
where you've struggled a bit?

00:18:14.100 --> 00:18:15.660
ARIANNA HUFFINGTON: Absolutely.

00:18:15.660 --> 00:18:19.210
I was very lucky that I had a
mother-- when I was growing up

00:18:19.210 --> 00:18:23.400
in Athens, Greece in a
one-bedroom apartment

00:18:23.400 --> 00:18:27.250
with no money-- who
always made me believe

00:18:27.250 --> 00:18:30.920
that I could take risks and that
it didn't matter if I failed.

00:18:30.920 --> 00:18:33.240
Because I think what
stops us, very often,

00:18:33.240 --> 00:18:35.810
from taking risks and
going for our dreams

00:18:35.810 --> 00:18:37.340
is that we don't want to fail.

00:18:37.340 --> 00:18:38.250
Especially women.

00:18:38.250 --> 00:18:41.710
For some reason, we
women want to be perfect.

00:18:41.710 --> 00:18:43.070
And we're not.

00:18:43.070 --> 00:18:44.730
Nobody is.

00:18:44.730 --> 00:18:48.000
Recognizing that failure,
as my mother used to say,

00:18:48.000 --> 00:18:50.450
is not the opposite of
success, but a stepping stone

00:18:50.450 --> 00:18:52.070
to success.

00:18:52.070 --> 00:18:55.980
That changes the way
we approach everything.

00:18:55.980 --> 00:18:57.810
For me, I would
say that the thing

00:18:57.810 --> 00:19:01.230
I've struggled the
most all my life

00:19:01.230 --> 00:19:07.130
is the voice inside my head that
I call the obnoxious roommate

00:19:07.130 --> 00:19:08.100
living in my head.

00:19:10.404 --> 00:19:11.820
ERIN SCHAEFER: We
also have those.

00:19:11.820 --> 00:19:12.120
ARIANNA HUFFINGTON:
We all have it.

00:19:12.120 --> 00:19:13.620
Yes.

00:19:13.620 --> 00:19:16.000
But you can really
work on that voice

00:19:16.000 --> 00:19:19.210
and you can really make
sure that that voice only

00:19:19.210 --> 00:19:21.960
gets guest appearances.

00:19:21.960 --> 00:19:25.410
And actually just to
link it back to sleep,

00:19:25.410 --> 00:19:28.370
when I'm sleep-deprived--
which now, I have to say,

00:19:28.370 --> 00:19:32.630
only happens about
5% of the time--

00:19:32.630 --> 00:19:35.970
that voice becomes intensified.

00:19:35.970 --> 00:19:37.090
So that's another thing.

00:19:37.090 --> 00:19:40.740
When we're rested and
recharged, that voice

00:19:40.740 --> 00:19:42.670
doesn't have as
much sway over us

00:19:42.670 --> 00:19:45.340
because we don't
identify with it.

00:19:45.340 --> 00:19:49.380
And so that voice of
self-doubt, of questioning

00:19:49.380 --> 00:19:54.390
what we are doing, is the most
draining thing in our lives.

00:19:54.390 --> 00:19:57.700
So if you notice
it, it's not really

00:19:57.700 --> 00:19:59.800
what we do that's
exhausting, it's

00:19:59.800 --> 00:20:02.600
really what our mind
does before and after.

00:20:02.600 --> 00:20:07.830
Before it's worrying-- if you
take our conversation today.

00:20:07.830 --> 00:20:10.050
My mind, beforehand,
can go into worry,

00:20:10.050 --> 00:20:13.640
anxiety-- are they going
to like what I'm saying?

00:20:13.640 --> 00:20:15.640
Am I going to remember
everything I want to say?

00:20:15.640 --> 00:20:18.150
All these things that
are monkey mind does.

00:20:18.150 --> 00:20:21.920
And then when we finish--
I love being here.

00:20:21.920 --> 00:20:22.690
This is fun.

00:20:22.690 --> 00:20:24.610
This is not work.

00:20:24.610 --> 00:20:26.400
I talk about something I love.

00:20:26.400 --> 00:20:27.400
You are fabulous.

00:20:27.400 --> 00:20:29.270
I'm meeting somebody new.

00:20:29.270 --> 00:20:32.680
And I look forward
to your questions.

00:20:32.680 --> 00:20:34.140
It's great.

00:20:34.140 --> 00:20:37.640
But if, then, I leave and my
mind-- the obnoxious roommate

00:20:37.640 --> 00:20:40.760
starts with--
[CLEARS THROAT] maybe I'm

00:20:40.760 --> 00:20:42.150
catching what Susan has.

00:20:44.990 --> 00:20:46.660
You forgot to say that.

00:20:46.660 --> 00:20:48.299
Oh, and the way you
told that story,

00:20:48.299 --> 00:20:49.590
I don't think it really worked.

00:20:49.590 --> 00:20:52.650
And why did you wear
that white jacket?

00:20:52.650 --> 00:20:53.280
You know?

00:20:53.280 --> 00:20:54.430
ERIN SCHAEFER: Because
it looks great.

00:20:54.430 --> 00:20:55.220
It looks great.

00:20:55.220 --> 00:20:56.640
ARIANNA HUFFINGTON: But
you know what I'm saying?

00:20:56.640 --> 00:20:58.556
ERIN SCHAEFER: Instead
of focusing on the fun,

00:20:58.556 --> 00:21:00.835
you focus on all
the little things.

00:21:00.835 --> 00:21:03.293
ARIANNA HUFFINGTON: All these
things which are meaningless.

00:21:03.293 --> 00:21:05.509
And is anybody
recognizing the voice?

00:21:05.509 --> 00:21:06.300
ERIN SCHAEFER: Yes.

00:21:06.300 --> 00:21:07.674
ARIANNA HUFFINGTON:
So let's just

00:21:07.674 --> 00:21:12.600
all make this
decision that we don't

00:21:12.600 --> 00:21:13.790
take this voice seriously.

00:21:13.790 --> 00:21:14.870
It's not the truth.

00:21:14.870 --> 00:21:15.990
It's not who we are.

00:21:15.990 --> 00:21:18.990
We can just treat
it like a child.

00:21:18.990 --> 00:21:20.700
You know when your
child says something

00:21:20.700 --> 00:21:22.840
and he throws a temper tantrum?

00:21:22.840 --> 00:21:26.210
You don't have to
actually act on it.

00:21:26.210 --> 00:21:27.640
ERIN SCHAEFER: Right.

00:21:27.640 --> 00:21:29.147
I shouldn't, in fact.

00:21:29.147 --> 00:21:31.605
ARIANNA HUFFINGTON: Especially
the two-and-a-half-year-old.

00:21:31.605 --> 00:21:32.396
ERIN SCHAEFER: Yes.

00:21:32.396 --> 00:21:33.990
Yes.

00:21:33.990 --> 00:21:36.760
Arianna, I wanted to ask--
because you also brought up

00:21:36.760 --> 00:21:43.270
your mother and her teaching
you that you could-- failure

00:21:43.270 --> 00:21:43.970
would be OK.

00:21:43.970 --> 00:21:47.750
And that you, as a woman,
would still be able to succeed.

00:21:47.750 --> 00:21:50.970
You've been a female leader
in a very traditionally

00:21:50.970 --> 00:21:52.570
male-dominated industry.

00:21:52.570 --> 00:21:56.150
And I know we have all
sorts of folks here today,

00:21:56.150 --> 00:21:58.820
but there are a lot of people
from our Women@ group at Google

00:21:58.820 --> 00:22:01.470
here and a lot of people
listening on the GVC.

00:22:01.470 --> 00:22:04.920
So I'm wondering if you have
any advice for the women here

00:22:04.920 --> 00:22:08.170
and beyond Google who are
often in a similar situation

00:22:08.170 --> 00:22:10.415
where they're in a
male-dominated industry--

00:22:10.415 --> 00:22:12.184
how to think about
showing up there.

00:22:12.184 --> 00:22:13.850
ARIANNA HUFFINGTON:
Well, I feel that we

00:22:13.850 --> 00:22:16.220
have a great opportunity--
as we were talking,

00:22:16.220 --> 00:22:20.550
actually, beforehand--
for women not just to take

00:22:20.550 --> 00:22:23.670
our place at the top of the
world in every profession,

00:22:23.670 --> 00:22:30.240
but to actually--
including the White House--

00:22:30.240 --> 00:22:34.280
but to actually change
the way the world works.

00:22:34.280 --> 00:22:39.070
Because right now, the way
work places have been designed

00:22:39.070 --> 00:22:44.420
and the work world
has been designed,

00:22:44.420 --> 00:22:45.830
has been designed by man.

00:22:45.830 --> 00:22:48.220
And it's not functioning well.

00:22:48.220 --> 00:22:52.755
It's not really good for
anybody, including polar bears.

00:22:52.755 --> 00:22:54.990
And I think women have
a greater opportunity

00:22:54.990 --> 00:22:56.370
to lead the way here.

00:22:56.370 --> 00:23:01.360
So I feel it's not just about
having the careers we want

00:23:01.360 --> 00:23:05.970
and knowing that we can have any
job and any position we want.

00:23:05.970 --> 00:23:08.180
But also doing it differently.

00:23:08.180 --> 00:23:11.480
Because there is a lot of pain
and suffering in the world that

00:23:11.480 --> 00:23:14.080
we cannot immediately change.

00:23:14.080 --> 00:23:16.550
But this is some
pain and suffering

00:23:16.550 --> 00:23:18.430
that we can immediately
change, simply

00:23:18.430 --> 00:23:22.670
by that cultural revolution
that we are talking about

00:23:22.670 --> 00:23:25.460
of moving away
from this delusion

00:23:25.460 --> 00:23:28.190
that we need to
burnout to succeed.

00:23:28.190 --> 00:23:32.350
And men are going to
be incredibly grateful.

00:23:32.350 --> 00:23:36.210
Because look at last year
alone at the number of men

00:23:36.210 --> 00:23:38.500
who collapsed on their
treadmills and either

00:23:38.500 --> 00:23:42.100
died or ended up
with heart attacks.

00:23:42.100 --> 00:23:44.470
Because what's happening
is that we've all

00:23:44.470 --> 00:23:47.720
accepted-- whether we do
it or not-- that exercise

00:23:47.720 --> 00:23:49.510
and nutrition are important.

00:23:49.510 --> 00:23:52.360
But this third pillar is sleep.

00:23:52.360 --> 00:23:55.630
And you have all these
sleep-deprived, type A

00:23:55.630 --> 00:23:58.980
executives getting up
at the crack of dawn

00:23:58.980 --> 00:24:00.750
to get their workout in.

00:24:00.750 --> 00:24:05.360
When, in fact, I urge
you to just sleep in.

00:24:05.360 --> 00:24:06.890
When you are sleep
deprived, that's

00:24:06.890 --> 00:24:10.280
more important than
dealing with that deficit.

00:24:10.280 --> 00:24:11.920
And then you'll have
a lot more energy,

00:24:11.920 --> 00:24:16.240
even if you do a shorter
workout or even if you skip it.

00:24:16.240 --> 00:24:20.030
You just need to look at
the science of how essential

00:24:20.030 --> 00:24:20.530
that is.

00:24:20.530 --> 00:24:25.480
And all these conversations
happening in the workplace

00:24:25.480 --> 00:24:27.590
changing the way
workplaces are designed--

00:24:27.590 --> 00:24:30.510
of course, at Google,
you're ahead of the curve,

00:24:30.510 --> 00:24:34.730
but so many other places are
not-- are Going to be key.

00:24:34.730 --> 00:24:37.820
And I'd love women, in
whatever field they are,

00:24:37.820 --> 00:24:44.980
to also take that into
account and to do it openly.

00:24:44.980 --> 00:24:47.930
Susan and I were
in Davos together.

00:24:47.930 --> 00:24:53.070
And we happened to be sitting
next to each other at a dinner

00:24:53.070 --> 00:24:56.640
and she was telling me how
she was pumping because she

00:24:56.640 --> 00:24:58.920
had just had her fifth child.

00:24:58.920 --> 00:25:02.410
And she said she goes back
to the hotel and she pumps

00:25:02.410 --> 00:25:04.470
and then she leaves
it out in the snow.

00:25:04.470 --> 00:25:07.812
Because she didn't
have a fridge.

00:25:07.812 --> 00:25:09.020
ERIN SCHAEFER: Very creative.

00:25:09.020 --> 00:25:11.930
She must have had enough
sleep to have a creative idea.

00:25:11.930 --> 00:25:13.680
ARIANNA HUFFINGTON:
And then I said, well,

00:25:13.680 --> 00:25:16.630
you have to take a picture
and Instagram it, I said.

00:25:16.630 --> 00:25:18.560
Because it would be
so great for this.

00:25:18.560 --> 00:25:19.134
And she did.

00:25:19.134 --> 00:25:20.550
I don't know if
you saw it, but it

00:25:20.550 --> 00:25:23.960
was so great to have
this powerful, woman

00:25:23.960 --> 00:25:27.650
executive who is also a
mother and is pumping.

00:25:27.650 --> 00:25:29.450
She didn't Instagram
herself pumping,

00:25:29.450 --> 00:25:35.480
she just-- she just Instagrammed
the milk in the snow.

00:25:35.480 --> 00:25:38.560
And I think that the
more openly women

00:25:38.560 --> 00:25:42.770
navigate their different
responsibilities

00:25:42.770 --> 00:25:46.910
and the more they
actually make it

00:25:46.910 --> 00:25:51.350
about a ruthless prioritization,
rather than the juggling

00:25:51.350 --> 00:25:56.050
act that drives us all
crazy, the more we'll

00:25:56.050 --> 00:25:58.119
be able to change
the culture faster.

00:25:58.119 --> 00:25:59.160
ERIN SCHAEFER: Wonderful.

00:25:59.160 --> 00:26:01.820
So we should be ourselves--
bring ourselves to work.

00:26:01.820 --> 00:26:02.820
ARIANNA HUFFINGTON: Yes.

00:26:02.820 --> 00:26:03.915
Our full selves.

00:26:03.915 --> 00:26:05.540
ERIN SCHAEFER: My
last question for you

00:26:05.540 --> 00:26:07.760
before I turn it over
to the audience here

00:26:07.760 --> 00:26:11.800
and to the folks that have been
asking questions on our Dory

00:26:11.800 --> 00:26:15.250
is really just this-- you
have accomplished so much.

00:26:15.250 --> 00:26:17.284
What is next for you?

00:26:17.284 --> 00:26:18.700
ARIANNA HUFFINGTON:
I didn't think

00:26:18.700 --> 00:26:21.340
there was going to be a next
after the Huffington Post.

00:26:21.340 --> 00:26:25.100
But in fact, "Thrive" and
"The Sleep Revolution"

00:26:25.100 --> 00:26:29.290
have led to so many amazing
conversations for me

00:26:29.290 --> 00:26:31.960
in so many companies
and with so many people

00:26:31.960 --> 00:26:36.390
that I've decided to launch
a new company, Thrive Global,

00:26:36.390 --> 00:26:39.900
which is going to be about
going into corporations

00:26:39.900 --> 00:26:41.840
and helping them
change the culture

00:26:41.840 --> 00:26:43.730
around these principles.

00:26:43.730 --> 00:26:47.040
And actually ending
this delusion

00:26:47.040 --> 00:26:50.440
that there is a trade-off
between productivity

00:26:50.440 --> 00:26:52.270
and well-being.

00:26:52.270 --> 00:26:55.640
And seeing that the two are, in
fact, incredibly interconnected

00:26:55.640 --> 00:26:58.620
and making all our
offerings, trainings,

00:26:58.620 --> 00:27:01.690
courses, very science-based.

00:27:01.690 --> 00:27:04.780
And then measuring the
impact of everything

00:27:04.780 --> 00:27:09.940
we're doing with these two
key metrics-- health care

00:27:09.940 --> 00:27:11.650
costs and productivity.

00:27:11.650 --> 00:27:15.790
Because I think the key to
accelerating this revolution

00:27:15.790 --> 00:27:17.387
is impacting the bottom line.

00:27:17.387 --> 00:27:18.470
ERIN SCHAEFER: Absolutely.

00:27:18.470 --> 00:27:21.094
ARIANNA HUFFINGTON: And helping
people recognize that, in fact,

00:27:21.094 --> 00:27:23.780
the well-being of
employees is really

00:27:23.780 --> 00:27:26.490
tied to the health
of the bottom line.

00:27:26.490 --> 00:27:32.950
And a pioneer in this
area is Mark Bertolini,

00:27:32.950 --> 00:27:36.920
the CEO of Aetna, who's
actually going to be joining

00:27:36.920 --> 00:27:39.740
the board of my new company.

00:27:39.740 --> 00:27:44.650
And I don't know if you saw
the latest thing he's done.

00:27:44.650 --> 00:27:47.330
He introduced this
program at Aetna,

00:27:47.330 --> 00:27:51.540
and employees are given
Fitbits to track their sleep.

00:27:51.540 --> 00:27:56.610
And if they get seven hours
or more for 20 nights,

00:27:56.610 --> 00:27:59.180
they are given $300.

00:27:59.180 --> 00:28:00.104
ERIN SCHAEFER: Wow.

00:28:00.104 --> 00:28:02.520
ARIANNA HUFFINGTON: It's not
just the financial incentive.

00:28:02.520 --> 00:28:04.660
Can you imagine
how revolutionary

00:28:04.660 --> 00:28:08.610
that is that the CEO of
a Fortune 500 company

00:28:08.610 --> 00:28:10.910
is telling you that
getting enough sleep

00:28:10.910 --> 00:28:12.459
is good for business?

00:28:12.459 --> 00:28:13.500
ERIN SCHAEFER: Fantastic.

00:28:13.500 --> 00:28:15.625
ARIANNA HUFFINGTON: It's
good for the shareholders.

00:28:15.625 --> 00:28:18.600
And then, he always
brings in Duke University

00:28:18.600 --> 00:28:22.655
or some scientific center
to measure the impact

00:28:22.655 --> 00:28:25.090
on productivity and
health care costs.

00:28:25.090 --> 00:28:28.260
So for me, that
will revolutionize

00:28:28.260 --> 00:28:30.900
how workplaces
function and that will

00:28:30.900 --> 00:28:35.335
make it much easier to
change lives and reduce

00:28:35.335 --> 00:28:38.175
all that unnecessary
pain and suffering.

00:28:38.175 --> 00:28:40.050
ERIN SCHAEFER: Well, we
can't wait to see it.

00:28:40.050 --> 00:28:42.660
And we make sure that you
get to talk to Sundar, Lazlo,

00:28:42.660 --> 00:28:46.230
and Eileen about this
idea with the FitBits.

00:28:46.230 --> 00:28:47.050
Thank you, Arianna.

00:28:47.050 --> 00:28:47.220
ARIANNA HUFFINGTON: Thank you.

00:28:47.220 --> 00:28:48.595
ERIN SCHAEFER:
With that, I would

00:28:48.595 --> 00:28:51.160
love to invite folks from the
audience here in San Bruno

00:28:51.160 --> 00:28:54.600
to come up to the mics with
any questions for Arianna.

00:28:54.600 --> 00:28:59.700
We'll first take one live here
and then we'll go to our Dory.

00:28:59.700 --> 00:29:02.220
Any brave souls want to
ask Arianna a question?

00:29:02.220 --> 00:29:02.990
ARIANNA HUFFINGTON:
And let us know--

00:29:02.990 --> 00:29:03.590
ERIN SCHAEFER: Here.

00:29:03.590 --> 00:29:05.881
Sorry, there's a mic right--
you probably can't see it.

00:29:05.881 --> 00:29:08.316
It's right in the middle
of the room over here.

00:29:08.316 --> 00:29:10.190
ARIANNA HUFFINGTON: And
let us know your name

00:29:10.190 --> 00:29:11.020
and what you're doing.

00:29:11.020 --> 00:29:11.090
ERIN SCHAEFER: Yes, please.

00:29:11.090 --> 00:29:11.660
ARIANNA HUFFINGTON:
If you want, you

00:29:11.660 --> 00:29:14.761
can tell us how many hours'
sleep you got last night.

00:29:14.761 --> 00:29:15.950
ERIN SCHAEFER: Last night.

00:29:15.950 --> 00:29:17.909
If you want to say how
much you got last night.

00:29:17.909 --> 00:29:19.616
AUDIENCE: I didn't
get enough last night.

00:29:19.616 --> 00:29:20.350
I'm Erin.

00:29:20.350 --> 00:29:23.472
I lead our product team for
our consumer music area.

00:29:23.472 --> 00:29:25.680
And I'm actually working on
trying to get more sleep.

00:29:25.680 --> 00:29:28.080
But it's really hard.

00:29:28.080 --> 00:29:32.190
My question for you--
you touched on earlier

00:29:32.190 --> 00:29:35.940
how the post is
covering the election

00:29:35.940 --> 00:29:38.200
and taking more of a
perspective of sometimes

00:29:38.200 --> 00:29:40.340
there isn't two
sides to a story.

00:29:40.340 --> 00:29:42.840
And what I've noticed, and
it's been talked about,

00:29:42.840 --> 00:29:46.320
is how people can very
easily, now, find content that

00:29:46.320 --> 00:29:48.040
reinforces their own views.

00:29:48.040 --> 00:29:49.810
And so there's
this echo chamber,

00:29:49.810 --> 00:29:54.110
where instead of going
to a central news source,

00:29:54.110 --> 00:29:56.530
people just share things.

00:29:56.530 --> 00:29:59.840
And it seems to be driving
more of a divide in opinion--

00:29:59.840 --> 00:30:01.180
public opinion.

00:30:01.180 --> 00:30:02.680
And so I'm curious
what you think.

00:30:02.680 --> 00:30:04.138
What are some of
the things that we

00:30:04.138 --> 00:30:09.179
can do to impact that
in a positive way?

00:30:09.179 --> 00:30:10.720
Because it seems to
be driving people

00:30:10.720 --> 00:30:13.702
to more extreme point of
view-- extreme points of view,

00:30:13.702 --> 00:30:15.410
and I'm curious to
your thoughts on that.

00:30:15.410 --> 00:30:15.940
ARIANNA HUFFINGTON: Thank you.

00:30:15.940 --> 00:30:17.981
Well, first of all-- before
I answer that-- can I

00:30:17.981 --> 00:30:20.999
give you just one very, very
simple tip about getting

00:30:20.999 --> 00:30:21.790
more sleep tonight?

00:30:21.790 --> 00:30:23.790
AUDIENCE: That sounds great.

00:30:23.790 --> 00:30:25.790
ARIANNA HUFFINGTON: And
since you have the book,

00:30:25.790 --> 00:30:27.460
you'll see the second
part of the book

00:30:27.460 --> 00:30:31.370
is all about best practices
and simple tips and techniques.

00:30:31.370 --> 00:30:33.130
But please don't go
to straight to that

00:30:33.130 --> 00:30:35.860
because the key thing
is to convince yourself

00:30:35.860 --> 00:30:38.910
by reading all the latest
scientific findings

00:30:38.910 --> 00:30:40.480
of how important it is.

00:30:40.480 --> 00:30:43.190
Because once you change your
mind about its importance,

00:30:43.190 --> 00:30:45.500
it will be easier to
change your habits.

00:30:45.500 --> 00:30:48.550
But the most important,
nonnegotiable thing

00:30:48.550 --> 00:30:51.590
is creating a little
transition to sleep.

00:30:51.590 --> 00:30:54.470
That's what we've
lost in modern times.

00:30:54.470 --> 00:30:56.120
And you still have
young children,

00:30:56.120 --> 00:30:59.342
so you know that you don't
just drop your child in bed.

00:30:59.342 --> 00:31:00.800
Some nights you
may wish you would.

00:31:00.800 --> 00:31:02.360
ERIN SCHAEFER: I wish, but no.

00:31:02.360 --> 00:31:05.750
ARIANNA HUFFINGTON: You give it
a bath, you put it in its PJs,

00:31:05.750 --> 00:31:06.750
you sing it a lullaby.

00:31:06.750 --> 00:31:10.880
So we need to do the
equivalent with ourselves.

00:31:10.880 --> 00:31:13.390
Each person's ritual
will be different.

00:31:13.390 --> 00:31:17.240
But it's creating your
own "Goodnight, Moon."

00:31:17.240 --> 00:31:22.930
Goodnight laptop,
goodnight smartphone.

00:31:22.930 --> 00:31:25.140
You escort them out
of your bedroom.

00:31:25.140 --> 00:31:27.950
That's the first key thing.

00:31:27.950 --> 00:31:31.030
Because we're all
addicted to our devices.

00:31:31.030 --> 00:31:31.920
Let's admit it.

00:31:31.920 --> 00:31:36.400
So they have to sleep
separately from you.

00:31:36.400 --> 00:31:39.030
And that's the first
nonnegotiable tip.

00:31:39.030 --> 00:31:41.240
And then there are
many, many, many others.

00:31:41.240 --> 00:31:43.240
But creating that
little ritual, even

00:31:43.240 --> 00:31:47.280
if you started with a
5, 10 minute demarcation

00:31:47.280 --> 00:31:49.680
line between your
day life-- with all

00:31:49.680 --> 00:31:54.980
our inevitable challenges and
obstacles and incompletions--

00:31:54.980 --> 00:31:57.860
and the time for us
to sleep and recharge.

00:31:57.860 --> 00:31:59.670
Mine is 30 minutes now.

00:31:59.670 --> 00:32:02.510
And I describe it in the book.

00:32:02.510 --> 00:32:05.042
It's going to make an
incredible difference.

00:32:05.042 --> 00:32:06.500
AUDIENCE: I'll
definitely try that.

00:32:06.500 --> 00:32:08.041
ARIANNA HUFFINGTON:
Back to politics.

00:32:09.980 --> 00:32:14.090
I feel that that's
definitely an issue,

00:32:14.090 --> 00:32:17.965
but I think the bigger
issue is that we

00:32:17.965 --> 00:32:21.140
are losing respect for facts.

00:32:21.140 --> 00:32:23.360
You see, I think that
it's perfectly OK

00:32:23.360 --> 00:32:26.310
to have divergent opinions.

00:32:26.310 --> 00:32:30.790
But we cannot have a different
set of facts that we base these

00:32:30.790 --> 00:32:32.280
opinions on.

00:32:32.280 --> 00:32:34.930
So when Hillary Clinton,
in her speech yesterday,

00:32:34.930 --> 00:32:38.060
said I believe in
science, that should not

00:32:38.060 --> 00:32:42.370
be a point of contrast
between two candidates.

00:32:42.370 --> 00:32:44.880
And I think that's
really where we

00:32:44.880 --> 00:32:53.755
need to be much more adamant
and much more absolute.

00:32:53.755 --> 00:32:56.870
What is the fact
behind this opinion?

00:32:56.870 --> 00:33:00.130
And I think that will
help close the divide

00:33:00.130 --> 00:33:02.857
we are experiencing right now.

00:33:02.857 --> 00:33:03.690
AUDIENCE: Thank you.

00:33:03.690 --> 00:33:05.390
ARIANNA HUFFINGTON: Thank you.

00:33:05.390 --> 00:33:05.940
ERIN SCHAEFER:
Arianna, I'm going

00:33:05.940 --> 00:33:07.731
to take a question from
our-- because we've

00:33:07.731 --> 00:33:10.700
got so many people around the
globe interested in seeing

00:33:10.700 --> 00:33:12.380
this and asking questions.

00:33:12.380 --> 00:33:15.970
Here's one that we have,
which is-- what role, Arianna,

00:33:15.970 --> 00:33:18.430
do you see live
streaming playing

00:33:18.430 --> 00:33:20.370
in all media in the future?

00:33:20.370 --> 00:33:24.510
And in general, what
has driven your decision

00:33:24.510 --> 00:33:27.740
to either leverage
an industry platform

00:33:27.740 --> 00:33:29.460
versus build one yourself?

00:33:29.460 --> 00:33:33.530
And the example here that the
question-asker gave was you

00:33:33.530 --> 00:33:37.200
spent-- I, of course lost the
question-- you spent resources

00:33:37.200 --> 00:33:39.990
to build a player for
Huff Po live instead

00:33:39.990 --> 00:33:41.324
of utilizing a free solution.

00:33:41.324 --> 00:33:43.740
So how do you decide to build
yourself versus use somebody

00:33:43.740 --> 00:33:44.239
else's?

00:33:44.239 --> 00:33:46.055
And how important do
you think live is?

00:33:46.055 --> 00:33:47.430
ARIANNA HUFFINGTON:
We think live

00:33:47.430 --> 00:33:48.780
is more and more important.

00:33:48.780 --> 00:33:51.390
And we're very-- in fact,
we considered, with Susan,

00:33:51.390 --> 00:33:56.160
doing part of this conversation
on your new offering--

00:33:56.160 --> 00:33:57.550
your live offering.

00:33:57.550 --> 00:33:59.720
We're doing a lot
with Facebook Live.

00:33:59.720 --> 00:34:01.960
We're doing a lot on Snapchat.

00:34:01.960 --> 00:34:04.560
And we also have our
own Huff Post live.

00:34:04.560 --> 00:34:06.730
Again, we're very agnostic.

00:34:06.730 --> 00:34:09.130
We want to be on every platform.

00:34:09.130 --> 00:34:13.120
And we want to be
on every platform

00:34:13.120 --> 00:34:17.699
in ways that are appropriate
to that platform.

00:34:17.699 --> 00:34:20.560
For example, for
one day, we took

00:34:20.560 --> 00:34:25.270
over a pop-up discover
channel on Snapchat.

00:34:25.270 --> 00:34:27.219
Called it Recharge
and it was all

00:34:27.219 --> 00:34:29.520
around sleep and recharging.

00:34:29.520 --> 00:34:32.020
And it was amazing.

00:34:32.020 --> 00:34:32.830
It was funny.

00:34:32.830 --> 00:34:38.270
It was all about--
a kind of message

00:34:38.270 --> 00:34:39.730
that would appeal
to millennials,

00:34:39.730 --> 00:34:42.080
and would not be
eat your broccoli.

00:34:42.080 --> 00:34:44.500
And make it sexy and
fun and give them

00:34:44.500 --> 00:34:49.164
all the stats about how
getting enough sleep

00:34:49.164 --> 00:34:51.659
deals with erectile
dysfunction, for example.

00:34:51.659 --> 00:34:54.260
Did you know that?

00:34:54.260 --> 00:34:58.200
And so made it appropriate
to the platform

00:34:58.200 --> 00:35:00.420
and it had incredible
engagement.

00:35:00.420 --> 00:35:03.870
So that's why we need to
be agnostic to the platform

00:35:03.870 --> 00:35:06.440
instead of expecting us
all-- expecting everybody

00:35:06.440 --> 00:35:07.631
to go to Huff Post live.

00:35:07.631 --> 00:35:10.130
ERIN SCHAEFER: But you think
live is increasingly important.

00:35:10.130 --> 00:35:10.270
ARIANNA HUFFINGTON: Yes.

00:35:10.270 --> 00:35:10.390
I think--

00:35:10.390 --> 00:35:11.610
ERIN SCHAEFER: And you
guys are investing in it.

00:35:11.610 --> 00:35:12.350
ARIANNA HUFFINGTON: Absolutely.

00:35:12.350 --> 00:35:14.390
And I think livestream
is very important.

00:35:14.390 --> 00:35:17.270
And even live events are
incredibly important.

00:35:17.270 --> 00:35:20.400
I remember there was a
time when we thought nobody

00:35:20.400 --> 00:35:22.865
would go to anything live.

00:35:22.865 --> 00:35:25.670
All of you could be
watching this on livestream

00:35:25.670 --> 00:35:27.950
but you chose to come here.

00:35:27.950 --> 00:35:30.780
I think the live stream is going
to be more and more important.

00:35:30.780 --> 00:35:33.540
And live events
will we always be

00:35:33.540 --> 00:35:36.820
important because-- especially
the more technology dominates

00:35:36.820 --> 00:35:42.270
our lives, the more
we actually still want

00:35:42.270 --> 00:35:43.940
that direct connection.

00:35:43.940 --> 00:35:45.230
ERIN SCHAEFER: Yes.

00:35:45.230 --> 00:35:46.180
Thank you.

00:35:46.180 --> 00:35:47.840
We will take a question
from the crowd.

00:35:47.840 --> 00:35:48.820
SCOTT: Hi, Arianna.

00:35:48.820 --> 00:35:49.630
My name is Scott.

00:35:49.630 --> 00:35:51.520
I'm on the partnerships
team here at YouTube.

00:35:51.520 --> 00:35:53.400
And last night I
slept for six hours.

00:35:55.980 --> 00:35:59.920
Piggy-backing off of
the last live question,

00:35:59.920 --> 00:36:02.420
in this presidential
election, where

00:36:02.420 --> 00:36:05.650
you have a lot of the rhetoric
on one side being based

00:36:05.650 --> 00:36:08.870
around fear and anger and
not around facts-- which

00:36:08.870 --> 00:36:11.050
is something that you were
saying Hillary Clinton

00:36:11.050 --> 00:36:14.829
was trying to reinforce the fact
that she believes in science.

00:36:14.829 --> 00:36:17.120
It's hard to believe that
that's an argument that we're

00:36:17.120 --> 00:36:19.840
making in 2016.

00:36:19.840 --> 00:36:23.640
What role and responsibility
do we play in media companies

00:36:23.640 --> 00:36:27.120
like Huffington Post,
YouTube-- other platforms

00:36:27.120 --> 00:36:30.930
around the world-- in
combating fear and anger

00:36:30.930 --> 00:36:33.220
and things that are
emotion-based-- and so strongly

00:36:33.220 --> 00:36:35.830
emotionally-based--
as opposed to things

00:36:35.830 --> 00:36:37.662
that aren't rooted in fact?

00:36:37.662 --> 00:36:39.370
ARIANNA HUFFINGTON:
Well, I love the fact

00:36:39.370 --> 00:36:45.350
that Susan called on
everybody to use the platform

00:36:45.350 --> 00:36:50.670
to express their views after
all this explosion of violence.

00:36:50.670 --> 00:36:54.910
And to actually recognize that
you are offering a very, very

00:36:54.910 --> 00:36:56.510
powerful tool.

00:36:56.510 --> 00:37:01.150
And more and more
people need to use it.

00:37:01.150 --> 00:37:05.020
And so this is not a
time to sit things out.

00:37:05.020 --> 00:37:09.950
And for me, this election
will be decided, in the end,

00:37:09.950 --> 00:37:13.010
by who turns out to vote.

00:37:13.010 --> 00:37:16.530
And anything that
the platform can

00:37:16.530 --> 00:37:20.560
do to reinforce that, you
don't have to tell them

00:37:20.560 --> 00:37:22.080
how to vote, obviously.

00:37:22.080 --> 00:37:27.810
But to make them recognize
that this is not an election

00:37:27.810 --> 00:37:31.370
to sit out and say, I don't
really like any-- either

00:37:31.370 --> 00:37:34.190
of the candidates very much.

00:37:34.190 --> 00:37:39.130
Because this is really
an existential threat

00:37:39.130 --> 00:37:43.970
to our democracy and people
need to take a stand.

00:37:43.970 --> 00:37:46.870
And they can take
a stand, obviously,

00:37:46.870 --> 00:37:51.210
by creating content-- by
expressing themselves,

00:37:51.210 --> 00:37:55.130
by sharing things that they feel
express their point of view--

00:37:55.130 --> 00:37:56.840
and by voting.

00:37:56.840 --> 00:37:59.180
And the more we can
get that message out

00:37:59.180 --> 00:38:03.780
to all the different
demographics that

00:38:03.780 --> 00:38:08.450
are on YouTube,
the more powerfully

00:38:08.450 --> 00:38:11.460
we can influence the outcome.

00:38:11.460 --> 00:38:12.209
SCOTT: Thank you.

00:38:12.209 --> 00:38:13.750
ERIN SCHAEFER: I
can speak for Google

00:38:13.750 --> 00:38:15.510
and say-- and YouTube--
and say that we

00:38:15.510 --> 00:38:18.220
are very committed to it using
our resources to help get out

00:38:18.220 --> 00:38:18.720
the vote.

00:38:18.720 --> 00:38:20.850
So they'll be a lot of
efforts here in the US,

00:38:20.850 --> 00:38:23.100
on YouTube and across
Google, to make sure

00:38:23.100 --> 00:38:25.395
that people get to get
out to vote and express

00:38:25.395 --> 00:38:26.020
their opinions.

00:38:26.020 --> 00:38:27.561
ARIANNA HUFFINGTON:
That's fantastic.

00:38:27.561 --> 00:38:29.480
And I'm saying-- I'm
on the board of Uber

00:38:29.480 --> 00:38:32.330
and we were having a
board meeting yesterday

00:38:32.330 --> 00:38:35.660
and we were talking about free
Uber rides to go to the polls.

00:38:35.660 --> 00:38:41.140
Whatever-- maybe Airbnb can-- if
you have travel to another city

00:38:41.140 --> 00:38:46.270
to vote, maybe Airbnb can
help subsidize where you stay.

00:38:46.270 --> 00:38:49.800
Basically, every company
needs to do what they can

00:38:49.800 --> 00:38:51.210
to encourage people to vote.

00:38:51.210 --> 00:38:55.210
Because it's absurd how many
millions and millions of people

00:38:55.210 --> 00:38:57.440
did not vote in
the last election.

00:38:57.440 --> 00:39:01.250
If we can change
that, it will have

00:39:01.250 --> 00:39:03.080
a huge impact on our democracy.

00:39:03.080 --> 00:39:04.660
I'm very happy to hear that.

00:39:04.660 --> 00:39:06.260
ERIN SCHAEFER: Absolutely.

00:39:06.260 --> 00:39:08.556
Changing gears a little
bit-- back to wellness--

00:39:08.556 --> 00:39:10.930
and this is something you and
I talked about this morning

00:39:10.930 --> 00:39:15.050
so I really want you to share
your point of view here.

00:39:15.050 --> 00:39:17.662
The question that we have from
somebody outside the office

00:39:17.662 --> 00:39:22.680
is, it seems easy to advocate
for slowing down and getting

00:39:22.680 --> 00:39:25.810
seven to eight hours of
sleep once you've made it.

00:39:25.810 --> 00:39:27.480
But how do you
counter the perception

00:39:27.480 --> 00:39:30.840
that you have to put in
time and sleep deprivation

00:39:30.840 --> 00:39:34.460
before earning the ability
to have a work life and sleep

00:39:34.460 --> 00:39:35.260
balance?

00:39:35.260 --> 00:39:36.390
ARIANNA HUFFINGTON:
Well, thank you so

00:39:36.390 --> 00:39:37.660
much for asking this question.

00:39:37.660 --> 00:39:40.290
Because my obnoxious
roommate, if we had not

00:39:40.290 --> 00:39:43.340
dealt with this topic, would
have told me afterwards,

00:39:43.340 --> 00:39:45.500
you should have
addressed that fact.

00:39:45.500 --> 00:39:48.420
Because that is a very
important fact and that's

00:39:48.420 --> 00:39:52.420
exactly what has led
to the founder myth.

00:39:52.420 --> 00:39:55.040
The idea that if you are
the founder of a company

00:39:55.040 --> 00:39:56.990
or if you are starting
in your career,

00:39:56.990 --> 00:40:02.710
you have to outwork
everybody and just pay

00:40:02.710 --> 00:40:04.380
your dues and all these things.

00:40:04.380 --> 00:40:07.405
And it is scientifically false.

00:40:07.405 --> 00:40:09.780
That doesn't mean that a lot
of people who have succeeded

00:40:09.780 --> 00:40:13.250
haven't been sleep-deprived
and exhausted along the way.

00:40:13.250 --> 00:40:13.830
It is.

00:40:13.830 --> 00:40:17.570
Because up until now, everybody
since the first industrial

00:40:17.570 --> 00:40:21.540
revolution, has been living and
working under this delusion.

00:40:21.540 --> 00:40:25.930
But it is not only unnecessary,
but counterproductive.

00:40:25.930 --> 00:40:28.140
Let me just give you an example.

00:40:28.140 --> 00:40:32.570
We all know the stat--
3/4 of start-ups fail.

00:40:32.570 --> 00:40:36.730
Start-up founders are
exhausted and sleep-deprived.

00:40:36.730 --> 00:40:39.410
Hey, maybe there is
a correlation here.

00:40:39.410 --> 00:40:41.420
Maybe we can change the stat.

00:40:41.420 --> 00:40:45.480
Because there's no question
that our cognitive performance

00:40:45.480 --> 00:40:47.900
is degraded when
we're exhausted.

00:40:47.900 --> 00:40:50.780
So that's why
understanding the science

00:40:50.780 --> 00:40:54.170
is so key to changing
that cultural perception.

00:40:54.170 --> 00:40:57.210
There was actually a great study
that came out in the "Harvard

00:40:57.210 --> 00:41:01.550
Business Review" by McKinsey--
too late to include in my book,

00:41:01.550 --> 00:41:03.450
but it will be in the paperback.

00:41:03.450 --> 00:41:06.630
A McKinsey study and the
title, you would have thought

00:41:06.630 --> 00:41:08.500
was out of The Onion.

00:41:08.500 --> 00:41:13.400
The title was "The Proven Link
Between Effective Leadership

00:41:13.400 --> 00:41:14.960
and Sleep."

00:41:14.960 --> 00:41:19.735
Now, can you imagine that
study even two years ago?

00:41:19.735 --> 00:41:21.960
And they walk you
through all the science

00:41:21.960 --> 00:41:24.360
of what happens to
your prefrontal cortex

00:41:24.360 --> 00:41:26.960
when you are sleep-deprived and
how it affects your decision

00:41:26.960 --> 00:41:27.460
making.

00:41:27.460 --> 00:41:31.280
And how it affects your capacity
to lead and to be empathetic

00:41:31.280 --> 00:41:33.690
and to build teams
and to inspire.

00:41:33.690 --> 00:41:36.582
And all the things that
are essential to leaders.

00:41:36.582 --> 00:41:38.315
ERIN SCHAEFER: Absolutely.

00:41:38.315 --> 00:41:40.440
I think we have another
question here in San Bruno.

00:41:40.440 --> 00:41:41.790
AUDIENCE: Hi, Arianna.

00:41:41.790 --> 00:41:43.520
I'm Daniel from the
living room team.

00:41:43.520 --> 00:41:45.353
I got about seven hours
of sleep last night.

00:41:47.710 --> 00:41:50.590
I was curious your thoughts,
if you had any-- recently

00:41:50.590 --> 00:41:52.280
it's come out that
Peter Thiel, who

00:41:52.280 --> 00:41:53.800
is a luminary figure
in the valley,

00:41:53.800 --> 00:41:56.950
but not without
controversy, has been

00:41:56.950 --> 00:42:00.570
bankrolling a number of
lawsuits against Gawker Media.

00:42:00.570 --> 00:42:04.530
The Supreme Court has told
us that money equals speech,

00:42:04.530 --> 00:42:06.460
so he's certainly entitled
to do as he wishes.

00:42:06.460 --> 00:42:07.918
But I'm curious if
you had thoughts

00:42:07.918 --> 00:42:11.800
on one billionaire trying to
take down a media company,

00:42:11.800 --> 00:42:17.640
irrespective of whether it's
a muckraker site or whatnot.

00:42:17.640 --> 00:42:19.560
ARIANNA HUFFINGTON:
I actually believe

00:42:19.560 --> 00:42:23.540
that it's not the
role of billionaires

00:42:23.540 --> 00:42:27.890
to try and take down sites.

00:42:27.890 --> 00:42:30.500
I think it is even
more dangerous

00:42:30.500 --> 00:42:33.480
when billionaires running
for president talk

00:42:33.480 --> 00:42:36.390
about punishing media.

00:42:36.390 --> 00:42:40.320
And I think that's really
infinitely more dangerous.

00:42:40.320 --> 00:42:43.780
And Donald Trump
has said many times

00:42:43.780 --> 00:42:49.710
that-- not only has he
demonstrated it already

00:42:49.710 --> 00:42:52.670
by removing credentials
from the Huffington Post,

00:42:52.670 --> 00:42:58.670
from "The Washington Post,"
from many media operations that

00:42:58.670 --> 00:43:00.960
have taken very strong
stances against him--

00:43:00.960 --> 00:43:03.750
or simply point out the facts.

00:43:03.750 --> 00:43:08.220
Again, "The Washington Post"
stories that made him so upset

00:43:08.220 --> 00:43:11.570
were not even-- were
not opinion-driven.

00:43:11.570 --> 00:43:13.752
They were fact-driven.

00:43:13.752 --> 00:43:17.870
And Peter Thiel also
speaking at the convention

00:43:17.870 --> 00:43:20.930
is something that I
don't understand at all.

00:43:20.930 --> 00:43:25.620
Maybe he did not read the
platform on gay rights.

00:43:25.620 --> 00:43:33.010
But people just need to try to
be more consistent about all

00:43:33.010 --> 00:43:34.710
these issues.

00:43:34.710 --> 00:43:38.890
And ultimately,
freedom of expression

00:43:38.890 --> 00:43:43.750
includes acknowledging that a
lot of things being expressed

00:43:43.750 --> 00:43:46.477
are not going to
be to my liking.

00:43:46.477 --> 00:43:47.310
AUDIENCE: Thank you.

00:43:47.310 --> 00:43:49.047
ARIANNA HUFFINGTON: Thank you.

00:43:49.047 --> 00:43:51.630
ERIN SCHAEFER: I think we have
another question coming up here

00:43:51.630 --> 00:43:53.892
in San Bruno.

00:43:53.892 --> 00:43:54.850
ARIANNA HUFFINGTON: Hi.

00:43:54.850 --> 00:43:56.744
AUDIENCE: Hello, Arianna.

00:43:56.744 --> 00:43:57.410
My name's Arnum.

00:43:57.410 --> 00:43:59.680
I'm from people operations team.

00:43:59.680 --> 00:44:00.940
I'm a huge fan of yours.

00:44:00.940 --> 00:44:04.210
I've been reading the
Huff Post since 2005.

00:44:04.210 --> 00:44:05.534
I read it every day.

00:44:05.534 --> 00:44:07.450
And the last night, I
think I got seven hours.

00:44:07.450 --> 00:44:09.400
But usually when I'm
trying to go to sleep,

00:44:09.400 --> 00:44:11.066
I'm usually reading
the Huffington Post.

00:44:13.930 --> 00:44:16.250
But I'll try to read it
around 9:00 and then quit.

00:44:16.250 --> 00:44:16.520
ARIANNA HUFFINGTON: Yes.

00:44:16.520 --> 00:44:17.020
Exactly.

00:44:17.020 --> 00:44:19.810
Just leave a little
break between the two.

00:44:19.810 --> 00:44:20.769
AUDIENCE: OK.

00:44:20.769 --> 00:44:22.560
So first off, thank
you so much for coming.

00:44:22.560 --> 00:44:25.060
It's great to see you in person.

00:44:25.060 --> 00:44:28.220
I have a question
about the media.

00:44:28.220 --> 00:44:30.640
It was reported, I think,
in 2000-- or excuse me,

00:44:30.640 --> 00:44:37.590
in March 2016 that Bush
had-- not Bush-- sorry

00:44:37.590 --> 00:44:38.769
I'm a little nervous.

00:44:38.769 --> 00:44:40.060
ARIANNA HUFFINGTON: No problem.

00:44:40.060 --> 00:44:42.101
AUDIENCE: It was reported
by "The New York Times"

00:44:42.101 --> 00:44:46.000
that Trump had almost $2
billion of free media coverage.

00:44:46.000 --> 00:44:48.670
And then, a couple other things
that have been interesting

00:44:48.670 --> 00:44:51.190
is in the 2000
presidential election,

00:44:51.190 --> 00:44:52.620
the media declared
Bush the winner

00:44:52.620 --> 00:44:54.920
before the votes in
Florida were even counted.

00:44:54.920 --> 00:44:58.750
And then, also, this
last election cycle-- I

00:44:58.750 --> 00:45:02.260
was a little bit upset when
California hadn't voted yet

00:45:02.260 --> 00:45:04.730
and the media declared
Clinton the winner

00:45:04.730 --> 00:45:07.511
of the Democratic nomination.

00:45:07.511 --> 00:45:09.260
So I'm just curious
what your thoughts are

00:45:09.260 --> 00:45:13.629
about the political manipulation
that's happening with the media

00:45:13.629 --> 00:45:16.170
and how they're changing public
opinion and things like that.

00:45:16.170 --> 00:45:18.990
And maybe how we
can counter that.

00:45:18.990 --> 00:45:21.440
ARIANNA HUFFINGTON: Well,
absolutely great question.

00:45:21.440 --> 00:45:29.150
And I'm very troubled
by the media's role,

00:45:29.150 --> 00:45:31.700
especially in this
election cycle.

00:45:31.700 --> 00:45:35.130
There was actually a great
study by the Shorenstein Center

00:45:35.130 --> 00:45:43.650
at Harvard about how effectively
the media dramatically

00:45:43.650 --> 00:45:46.080
helped Donald Trump
win the nomination.

00:45:46.080 --> 00:45:47.580
Because at the
beginning, when they

00:45:47.580 --> 00:45:50.600
were giving him this
amazing amount of coverage--

00:45:50.600 --> 00:45:53.550
that, as you said, was the
equivalent of $2 billion

00:45:53.550 --> 00:45:58.210
in free advertising-- there
was not justification for it.

00:45:58.210 --> 00:46:00.890
He was not ahead in the polls.

00:46:00.890 --> 00:46:03.850
He had not to build
the kind of fundraising

00:46:03.850 --> 00:46:09.310
or organizational
teams that would make

00:46:09.310 --> 00:46:12.200
him a legitimate candidate.

00:46:12.200 --> 00:46:15.980
So it was purely
because of ratings.

00:46:15.980 --> 00:46:17.910
And they even
allowed him to phone

00:46:17.910 --> 00:46:21.870
in to major political shows,
including the Sunday shows,

00:46:21.870 --> 00:46:25.060
which never happens.

00:46:25.060 --> 00:46:27.580
And so a lot of what the
media have been doing

00:46:27.580 --> 00:46:31.440
has been ratings-driven,
rather than driven

00:46:31.440 --> 00:46:36.310
by basic journalistic ethics.

00:46:36.310 --> 00:46:40.400
And we've done a lot of coverage
on that again and again.

00:46:40.400 --> 00:46:47.350
And it's also a
recognition that,

00:46:47.350 --> 00:46:50.790
for me, came very
much to the forefront

00:46:50.790 --> 00:46:55.300
when I was giving a
commencement speech at Fletcher,

00:46:55.300 --> 00:46:58.970
which is a foreign
service school at Tufts.

00:46:58.970 --> 00:47:02.960
And it also houses the
Edward Murrow papers.

00:47:02.960 --> 00:47:06.150
And I was talking to the
head of the Murrow Center

00:47:06.150 --> 00:47:09.200
about how would he have
handled Donald Trump

00:47:09.200 --> 00:47:12.230
and he said he would
have skewered him.

00:47:12.230 --> 00:47:16.910
And if you go back and see
how Murrow handled McCarthy,

00:47:16.910 --> 00:47:20.470
this is not the time
to actually hold back.

00:47:20.470 --> 00:47:22.520
And far too many
journalists, even

00:47:22.520 --> 00:47:30.890
the way they are covering these
conventions, focusing on things

00:47:30.890 --> 00:47:37.820
that are legitimizing the entire
charade of the Trump candidacy,

00:47:37.820 --> 00:47:42.210
shows that these are all
ratings-driven decisions.

00:47:42.210 --> 00:47:42.930
Nothing else.

00:47:42.930 --> 00:47:45.470
I don't think there is
some deep manipulation

00:47:45.470 --> 00:47:48.820
behind these decisions, except
that when Donald Trump was

00:47:48.820 --> 00:47:52.650
on "Meet the Press," it was
the biggest rating bonanza

00:47:52.650 --> 00:47:56.020
that Chuck Todd had.

00:47:56.020 --> 00:47:56.930
SPEAKER 1: Thank you.

00:47:56.930 --> 00:47:57.273
ARIANNA HUFFINGTON: Thank you.

00:47:57.273 --> 00:47:58.280
ERIN SCHAEFER: Well,
Chuck Todd is not

00:47:58.280 --> 00:48:00.410
letting him call in
anymore, and we can all

00:48:00.410 --> 00:48:04.420
be very proud of Chuck, who's
one of my favorite journalists.

00:48:04.420 --> 00:48:06.130
One last question,
Arianna, because we're

00:48:06.130 --> 00:48:08.110
at the end of our time, sadly.

00:48:08.110 --> 00:48:10.530
But I want to get back
to wellness and Thrive.

00:48:10.530 --> 00:48:14.590
So one last question from
here was, how important

00:48:14.590 --> 00:48:17.240
is napping to productivity
and well-being?

00:48:17.240 --> 00:48:19.210
And have you seen
examples of napping

00:48:19.210 --> 00:48:22.430
being incorporated and
integrated successfully

00:48:22.430 --> 00:48:24.490
into a company's culture?

00:48:24.490 --> 00:48:25.700
ARIANNA HUFFINGTON: Yes.

00:48:25.700 --> 00:48:28.260
First of all, napping
is incredibly important.

00:48:28.260 --> 00:48:30.150
Now, if you've
gotten all the sleep

00:48:30.150 --> 00:48:33.190
you need, which-- just to remind
you-- is seven to nine hours,

00:48:33.190 --> 00:48:34.952
unless you have a
genetic mutation.

00:48:34.952 --> 00:48:36.910
ERIN SCHAEFER: Which is
only one in 100 people,

00:48:36.910 --> 00:48:38.994
so you are unlikely to
have that genetic mutation.

00:48:38.994 --> 00:48:41.451
ARIANNA HUFFINGTON: But I'm
sure one or two of you here do.

00:48:41.451 --> 00:48:43.650
And you know that, and
if you don't know that,

00:48:43.650 --> 00:48:46.210
you can test yourself.

00:48:46.210 --> 00:48:51.410
But having said that,
napping is amazing.

00:48:51.410 --> 00:48:53.419
If you didn't get enough
sleep, for whatever

00:48:53.419 --> 00:48:55.210
reason-- and that's
always going to happen.

00:48:55.210 --> 00:48:57.710
You have a sick child,
you have a big deadline,

00:48:57.710 --> 00:49:01.640
your flight was late--
then try and get a nap

00:49:01.640 --> 00:49:04.670
as soon as possible in the day.

00:49:04.670 --> 00:49:07.950
Even a 20-minute nap is
unbelievably restorative.

00:49:07.950 --> 00:49:11.910
Winston Churchill regularly
napped and won the Second World

00:49:11.910 --> 00:49:13.480
War.

00:49:13.480 --> 00:49:16.950
And called them power naps.

00:49:16.950 --> 00:49:19.810
At the Huffington Post,
we have two nap rooms

00:49:19.810 --> 00:49:20.970
and they're always full.

00:49:20.970 --> 00:49:23.355
I know here, you have
a lot of nap pods.

00:49:23.355 --> 00:49:24.230
ERIN SCHAEFER: We do.

00:49:24.230 --> 00:49:26.030
And nap rooms in almost
every office, yes.

00:49:26.030 --> 00:49:28.260
ARIANNA HUFFINGTON: And here at
YouTube , you have a nap room?

00:49:28.260 --> 00:49:29.090
ERIN SCHAEFER: We do.

00:49:29.090 --> 00:49:29.510
ARIANNA HUFFINGTON: Great.

00:49:29.510 --> 00:49:31.410
Does everybody know
where the nap room is?

00:49:31.410 --> 00:49:32.610
ERIN SCHAEFER: We have
nap pods and rooms.

00:49:32.610 --> 00:49:34.080
ARIANNA HUFFINGTON: Great.

00:49:34.080 --> 00:49:38.500
I think that-- I'm predicting
that within the next five

00:49:38.500 --> 00:49:40.520
years, the nap
room is going to be

00:49:40.520 --> 00:49:44.440
as universal as the
conference room.

00:49:44.440 --> 00:49:49.210
In every company, not
just pioneering companies

00:49:49.210 --> 00:49:52.340
like Google and YouTube.

00:49:52.340 --> 00:49:54.670
The thing that we
need to recognize

00:49:54.670 --> 00:49:58.810
is that even the middle of
the afternoon, or at any point

00:49:58.810 --> 00:50:02.850
you feel really
tired, there's nothing

00:50:02.850 --> 00:50:05.890
that's going to increase
your productivity as

00:50:05.890 --> 00:50:08.140
fast as a little nap.

00:50:08.140 --> 00:50:14.410
And it's going to
dramatically transform

00:50:14.410 --> 00:50:17.640
how we handle these
afternoon low points,

00:50:17.640 --> 00:50:23.770
where normally, we go for the
fifth cup of coffee or a donut

00:50:23.770 --> 00:50:27.310
or whatever it is
to get some energy.

00:50:27.310 --> 00:50:31.070
This is all part of the culture
change that is happening.

00:50:31.070 --> 00:50:32.950
And that I hope,
with your help--

00:50:32.950 --> 00:50:37.810
you're amazing creators
and leaders in our culture.

00:50:37.810 --> 00:50:42.700
So you have an incredible power
to accelerate a cultural change

00:50:42.700 --> 00:50:44.190
that's already
happening and that's

00:50:44.190 --> 00:50:49.070
going to bring some amazing
change in people's lives.

00:50:49.070 --> 00:50:51.730
And we'd love to hear from
you on the Huffington Post.

00:50:51.730 --> 00:50:53.430
You can send me
anything you want--

00:50:53.430 --> 00:50:55.630
arianna@huffingtonpost.com.

00:50:55.630 --> 00:50:57.390
We'd love to post it.

00:50:57.390 --> 00:51:00.720
And of course, you can
crosspost it anywhere,

00:51:00.720 --> 00:51:02.430
including on that
little platform

00:51:02.430 --> 00:51:04.787
you work for called YouTube.

00:51:04.787 --> 00:51:07.370
ERIN SCHAEFER: Well, Arianna we
cannot wait to see what you do

00:51:07.370 --> 00:51:07.960
with Thrive.

00:51:07.960 --> 00:51:10.300
Thank you so much for
being with us here today.

00:51:10.300 --> 00:51:11.550
ARIANNA HUFFINGTON: Thank you.

00:51:11.550 --> 00:51:12.550
Thank you.

00:51:19.524 --> 00:51:22.690
And can we please give me
a round of applause to you?

00:51:22.690 --> 00:51:24.714
Because you did such a
great job stepping in.

00:51:24.714 --> 00:51:26.130
ERIN SCHAEFER:
Thank you, Arianna.

00:51:28.680 --> 00:51:30.940
In your honor, let's
all try to get seven

00:51:30.940 --> 00:51:33.970
to nine hours of sleep
tonight and beyond, everyone.

00:51:33.970 --> 00:51:36.050
Thank you so much.
