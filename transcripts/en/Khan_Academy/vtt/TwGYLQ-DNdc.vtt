00:00:00.484 --> 00:00:02.896
- Nutritionists measured the sugar content

00:00:02.896 --> 00:00:05.962
in grams for 32 drinks at Starbucks.

00:00:05.962 --> 00:00:08.856
A cumulative relative
frequency graph, let me

00:00:08.856 --> 00:00:13.797
underline that, a cumulative
relative frequency graph

00:00:13.797 --> 00:00:16.394
for the data is shown below.

00:00:16.394 --> 00:00:18.551
So, they have different
on the horizontal axis,

00:00:18.551 --> 00:00:21.410
different amounts of
sugar in grams and then,

00:00:21.410 --> 00:00:23.631
we have the cumulative
relative frequencies.

00:00:23.631 --> 00:00:25.795
Let's just make sure we
understand how to read this.

00:00:25.795 --> 00:00:29.962
This is saying that zero or
zero percent of the drinks

00:00:31.479 --> 00:00:35.646
have a sugar content,
have no sugar content.

00:00:35.646 --> 00:00:37.675
This right over here, this data point,

00:00:37.675 --> 00:00:40.599
this looks like it's at the .5 grams

00:00:40.599 --> 00:00:44.515
and then this looks like it's at 0.1.

00:00:44.515 --> 00:00:48.814
This says that 0.1, or
I guess we could say

00:00:48.814 --> 00:00:52.687
10 percent of the drinks that Starbucks

00:00:52.687 --> 00:00:55.937
offers has five grams of sugar or less.

00:00:57.240 --> 00:01:00.378
This data point tells us that a hundred

00:01:00.378 --> 00:01:03.873
percent of drinks at
Starbucks has 50 grams

00:01:03.873 --> 00:01:05.290
of sugar or less.

00:01:06.830 --> 00:01:08.592
The cumulative relative
frequency, that's why

00:01:08.592 --> 00:01:12.233
at each of these points we
say this is the frequency

00:01:12.233 --> 00:01:15.051
that has that much sugar or less.

00:01:15.051 --> 00:01:16.786
And, that's why it just
keeps on increasing

00:01:16.786 --> 00:01:18.956
and increasing as we add more sugar

00:01:18.956 --> 00:01:21.873
we're going to see a larger portion

00:01:22.709 --> 00:01:24.637
or a larger relative frequency has that

00:01:24.637 --> 00:01:26.220
much sugar or less.

00:01:27.576 --> 00:01:29.987
So, let's read the first question.

00:01:29.987 --> 00:01:33.188
An iced coffee has 15 grams of sugar.

00:01:33.188 --> 00:01:35.421
Estimate the percentile of this drink

00:01:35.421 --> 00:01:37.358
to the nearest whole percent.

00:01:37.358 --> 00:01:40.441
So, iced coffee has 15 grams of sugar

00:01:41.310 --> 00:01:43.432
which would be right over here.

00:01:43.432 --> 00:01:45.283
And so, let's estimate the percentile.

00:01:45.283 --> 00:01:46.559
So, we can see they actually have

00:01:46.559 --> 00:01:48.529
a data point right over here and

00:01:48.529 --> 00:01:51.362
we can see that 20 percent or 0.2,

00:01:52.911 --> 00:01:56.375
20 percent of the drinks that Starbucks

00:01:56.375 --> 00:01:59.458
offers has 15 grams of sugar or less.

00:02:01.154 --> 00:02:03.150
So, the percentile of this drink,

00:02:03.150 --> 00:02:04.859
if I were to estimate it, looks like

00:02:04.859 --> 00:02:08.037
it's the relative frequency 0.2 has

00:02:08.037 --> 00:02:10.277
that much sugar or less so this percentile

00:02:10.277 --> 00:02:11.816
would be 20 percent.

00:02:11.816 --> 00:02:13.096
Once again, another way to think about it,

00:02:13.096 --> 00:02:15.525
to read this you could
convert these to percentages.

00:02:15.525 --> 00:02:18.897
You could say that 20 percent
has this much sugar or less.

00:02:18.897 --> 00:02:21.402
15 grams of sugar or
less, so an iced coffee

00:02:21.402 --> 00:02:23.569
is in the 20th percentile.

00:02:24.968 --> 00:02:27.135
Let's do another question.

00:02:29.438 --> 00:02:33.732
So here, we are asked
to estimate the median

00:02:33.732 --> 00:02:35.764
of the distribution of drinks.

00:02:35.764 --> 00:02:38.143
Hint to think about the 50th percentile.

00:02:38.143 --> 00:02:40.209
So, the median, if you were to line up all

00:02:40.209 --> 00:02:42.002
of the drinks, you would
take the middle drink.

00:02:42.002 --> 00:02:43.607
And so, you could view that as well, what

00:02:43.607 --> 00:02:46.556
drink is exactly at the 50th percentile?

00:02:46.556 --> 00:02:48.357
So, now let's look at the 50th percentile

00:02:48.357 --> 00:02:52.097
would be a cumulative
relative frequency of 0.5,

00:02:52.097 --> 00:02:56.242
which would be right over
here on our vertical axis.

00:02:56.242 --> 00:02:59.956
Another way to think about
it is 0.5, or 50 percent

00:02:59.956 --> 00:03:02.888
of the drinks are going,
if we go to this point

00:03:02.888 --> 00:03:05.580
right over here, what
has a cumulative relative

00:03:05.580 --> 00:03:06.997
frequency of 0.5.

00:03:07.978 --> 00:03:11.445
We see that we are right at
looks like this is 25 grams.

00:03:11.445 --> 00:03:15.591
So, one way to interpret
this is 50 percent

00:03:15.591 --> 00:03:18.841
of the drinks have less than or have 25

00:03:19.752 --> 00:03:21.669
grams of sugar or less.

00:03:22.592 --> 00:03:24.724
So, this looks like a pretty good estimate

00:03:24.724 --> 00:03:27.785
for the median, for the middle data point.

00:03:27.785 --> 00:03:31.118
So, the median is approximately 25 grams

00:03:32.348 --> 00:03:36.515
that half of the drinks have
25 grams or less of sugar.

00:03:39.115 --> 00:03:43.088
Let's do one more based
on the same data set.

00:03:43.088 --> 00:03:46.652
So, here we're asked,
what is the best estimate

00:03:46.652 --> 00:03:50.870
for the interquartile range
of the distribution of drinks?

00:03:50.870 --> 00:03:53.071
So, the interquartile
range, we wanna figure out

00:03:53.071 --> 00:03:56.139
well, what's sitting
at the 25th percentile?

00:03:56.139 --> 00:03:57.466
And we wanna think about what's

00:03:57.466 --> 00:03:59.322
at the 75th percentile, and then we

00:03:59.322 --> 00:04:01.521
want to take the difference.

00:04:01.521 --> 00:04:04.552
That's what the interquartile range is.

00:04:04.552 --> 00:04:05.507
So, let's do that.

00:04:05.507 --> 00:04:08.092
So, first the 25th
percentile, we wanna look

00:04:08.092 --> 00:04:12.049
at the cumulative relative
frequency, so 25th

00:04:12.049 --> 00:04:13.975
this would be 30th, so
the 25th would be right

00:04:13.975 --> 00:04:17.826
around here and so, it looks like the 25th

00:04:17.826 --> 00:04:21.993
percentile is that looks
like about, I don't know,

00:04:23.377 --> 00:04:25.637
and we're estimating here,
so that looks like it's

00:04:25.637 --> 00:04:29.804
about this would be 15, I
would say maybe 18 grams.

00:04:32.106 --> 00:04:33.686
So, approximately 18 grams.

00:04:33.686 --> 00:04:35.682
Once again, one way to think about it is,

00:04:35.682 --> 00:04:39.849
25 percent of the drinks have
18 grams of sugar or less.

00:04:40.929 --> 00:04:42.923
Now, let's look at the 75th percentile.

00:04:42.923 --> 00:04:47.294
So it's the 70th, 75th
would be right over there.

00:04:47.294 --> 00:04:48.637
Actually, I can draw a
straighter line than that.

00:04:48.637 --> 00:04:51.127
I have a line tool here.

00:04:51.127 --> 00:04:54.960
75th percentile would
put me right over there.

00:04:57.262 --> 00:04:59.302
I don't know, that
looks like, I'll go with

00:04:59.302 --> 00:05:01.552
39 grams, roughly 39 grams.

00:05:04.898 --> 00:05:07.727
And so, what's the
difference between these two?

00:05:07.727 --> 00:05:09.714
Well, the difference
between these two, it looks

00:05:09.714 --> 00:05:12.421
like it's about 21 grams.

00:05:12.421 --> 00:05:15.834
So, our interquartile range, our estimate

00:05:15.834 --> 00:05:17.556
of our interquartile
range, looking at this

00:05:17.556 --> 00:05:20.172
cumulative relative
frequency distribution,

00:05:20.172 --> 00:05:22.356
'cause we're sayin',
hey look, it looks like

00:05:22.356 --> 00:05:24.752
the 25th percentile, looks like 25 percent

00:05:24.752 --> 00:05:26.801
of the drinks have 18 grams or less.

00:05:26.801 --> 00:05:30.055
75 percent of the drinks
have 39 grams or less.

00:05:30.055 --> 00:05:32.813
If we take the difference
between these two

00:05:32.813 --> 00:05:35.850
quartiles, this is the first quartile,

00:05:35.850 --> 00:05:37.634
this is our third quartile.

00:05:37.634 --> 00:05:39.602
We're gonna get 21 grams.

00:05:39.602 --> 00:05:41.442
Now, if we look at this
choice, the choices

00:05:41.442 --> 00:05:43.563
right over here, 20 grams definitely

00:05:43.563 --> 00:05:45.294
seems like the best estimate,

00:05:45.294 --> 00:05:47.722
closest to what we were able to estimate

00:05:47.722 --> 00:05:49.503
based on looking at this cumulative

00:05:49.503 --> 00:05:51.586
relative frequency graph.
