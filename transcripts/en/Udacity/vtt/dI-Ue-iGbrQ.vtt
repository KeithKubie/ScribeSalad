Congratulations.

00:00:01.650 --> 00:00:05.170
You've created a master resume
spreadsheet and a targeted resume.

00:00:05.170 --> 00:00:08.552
Additionally, throughout this lesson
you reviewed key resume components and

00:00:08.552 --> 00:00:10.060
conventions.

00:00:10.060 --> 00:00:12.870
Moving forward you will have
access to a resume checklist and

00:00:12.870 --> 00:00:16.550
outside resources like, keyword guides,
summary statement guidelines, and

00:00:16.550 --> 00:00:19.840
formatting guidelines,
which you can find in instructor notes.

00:00:19.840 --> 00:00:23.360

job hunt strategically.

00:00:23.360 --> 00:00:23.910
