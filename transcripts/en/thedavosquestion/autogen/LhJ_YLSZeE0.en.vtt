India being a superpower I think it's
 

00:00:08.040 --> 00:00:09.830
India being a superpower I think it's
wanted a big that happens about an

wanted a big that happens about an
 

00:00:09.840 --> 00:00:12.770
wanted a big that happens about an
objective and about what power actually

00:00:12.770 --> 00:00:12.780
objective and about what power actually
 

00:00:12.780 --> 00:00:15.620
objective and about what power actually
means let's look at Power first I think

00:00:15.620 --> 00:00:15.630
means let's look at Power first I think
 

00:00:15.630 --> 00:00:18.230
means let's look at Power first I think
if you were to look at either india and

00:00:18.230 --> 00:00:18.240
if you were to look at either india and
 

00:00:18.240 --> 00:00:19.880
if you were to look at either india and
the dimension of talent within the

00:00:19.880 --> 00:00:19.890
the dimension of talent within the
 

00:00:19.890 --> 00:00:23.840
the dimension of talent within the
convention of power it could be many

00:00:23.840 --> 00:00:23.850
convention of power it could be many
 

00:00:23.850 --> 00:00:25.279
convention of power it could be many
things to many people to me i think

00:00:25.279 --> 00:00:25.289
things to many people to me i think
 

00:00:25.289 --> 00:00:26.810
things to many people to me i think
fundamentally we are a very tolerant

00:00:26.810 --> 00:00:26.820
fundamentally we are a very tolerant
 

00:00:26.820 --> 00:00:30.050
fundamentally we are a very tolerant
country so intrinsically we have the

00:00:30.050 --> 00:00:30.060
country so intrinsically we have the
 

00:00:30.060 --> 00:00:31.880
country so intrinsically we have the
ability to do what we believe we wanted

00:00:31.880 --> 00:00:31.890
ability to do what we believe we wanted
 

00:00:31.890 --> 00:00:33.380
ability to do what we believe we wanted
to do so I think tolerance is the

00:00:33.380 --> 00:00:33.390
to do so I think tolerance is the
 

00:00:33.390 --> 00:00:36.290
to do so I think tolerance is the
underlying essence of what we do and and

00:00:36.290 --> 00:00:36.300
underlying essence of what we do and and
 

00:00:36.300 --> 00:00:38.299
underlying essence of what we do and and
our focus is being built around that to

00:00:38.299 --> 00:00:38.309
our focus is being built around that to
 

00:00:38.309 --> 00:00:40.700
our focus is being built around that to
me I think power stems from how we

00:00:40.700 --> 00:00:40.710
me I think power stems from how we
 

00:00:40.710 --> 00:00:43.639
me I think power stems from how we
leverage our internal capabilities to to

00:00:43.639 --> 00:00:43.649
leverage our internal capabilities to to
 

00:00:43.649 --> 00:00:44.750
leverage our internal capabilities to to
tell you about what we can actually

00:00:44.750 --> 00:00:44.760
tell you about what we can actually
 

00:00:44.760 --> 00:00:47.000
tell you about what we can actually
deliver as a nation so power could mean

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:47.010
deliver as a nation so power could mean
 

00:00:47.010 --> 00:00:49.729
deliver as a nation so power could mean
you know how do we utilize our Italian

00:00:49.729 --> 00:00:49.739
you know how do we utilize our Italian
 

00:00:49.739 --> 00:00:51.170
you know how do we utilize our Italian

resources that's in the country to
actually be far more productive

00:00:56.590 --> 00:00:56.600
actually be far more productive
 

00:00:56.600 --> 00:00:59.510

self-sufficient and the other dimension

00:00:59.510 --> 00:00:59.520
self-sufficient and the other dimension
 

00:00:59.520 --> 00:01:01.279
self-sufficient and the other dimension
is the one on super I think super is

00:01:01.279 --> 00:01:01.289

other countries and nations actually
look at India from their perspective I

00:01:33.770 --> 00:01:33.780
look at India from their perspective I
 

00:01:33.780 --> 00:01:36.140
look at India from their perspective I
think so what we typically been doing is

00:01:36.140 --> 00:01:36.150
think so what we typically been doing is
 

00:01:36.150 --> 00:01:38.179
think so what we typically been doing is
an inward outward look in terms of

00:01:38.179 --> 00:01:38.189
an inward outward look in terms of
 

00:01:38.189 --> 00:01:39.440
an inward outward look in terms of
saying hey this is India this is the

00:01:39.440 --> 00:01:39.450
saying hey this is India this is the
 

00:01:39.450 --> 00:01:42.140
saying hey this is India this is the
outside environment and it's time for

00:01:42.140 --> 00:01:42.150
outside environment and it's time for
 

00:01:42.150 --> 00:01:43.310
outside environment and it's time for
the others to look at as in terms of

00:01:43.310 --> 00:01:43.320
the others to look at as in terms of
 

00:01:43.320 --> 00:01:45.350
the others to look at as in terms of
what we are capable of so today when you

00:01:45.350 --> 00:01:45.360
what we are capable of so today when you
 

00:01:45.360 --> 00:01:46.940
what we are capable of so today when you
hear of you know leveraging India's

00:01:46.940 --> 00:01:46.950
hear of you know leveraging India's
 

00:01:46.950 --> 00:01:48.499
hear of you know leveraging India's
capabilities it's about saying hey what

00:01:48.499 --> 00:01:48.509
capabilities it's about saying hey what
 

00:01:48.509 --> 00:01:50.240
capabilities it's about saying hey what
the US is think about India and what

00:01:50.240 --> 00:01:50.250
the US is think about India and what
 

00:01:50.250 --> 00:01:51.590
the US is think about India and what
some of the other nations are thinking

00:01:51.590 --> 00:01:51.600
some of the other nations are thinking
 

00:01:51.600 --> 00:01:53.030
some of the other nations are thinking
about in here I think it's time for

00:01:53.030 --> 00:01:53.040
about in here I think it's time for
 

00:01:53.040 --> 00:01:54.980
about in here I think it's time for
India to say hey this is what we stand

00:01:54.980 --> 00:01:54.990
India to say hey this is what we stand
 

00:01:54.990 --> 00:01:56.920
India to say hey this is what we stand
for and start leveraging some of those

00:01:56.920 --> 00:01:56.930
for and start leveraging some of those
 

00:01:56.930 --> 00:01:58.819
for and start leveraging some of those
to me let's look at some of the

00:01:58.819 --> 00:01:58.829
to me let's look at some of the
 

00:01:58.829 --> 00:02:00.679
to me let's look at some of the
dimensions of what the basic elements of

00:02:00.679 --> 00:02:00.689
dimensions of what the basic elements of
 

00:02:00.689 --> 00:02:02.840
dimensions of what the basic elements of
nature's are let's look at water in fact

00:02:02.840 --> 00:02:02.850
nature's are let's look at water in fact
 

00:02:02.850 --> 00:02:04.310
nature's are let's look at water in fact
there's a theory going now to say that

00:02:04.310 --> 00:02:04.320
there's a theory going now to say that
 

00:02:04.320 --> 00:02:07.160
there's a theory going now to say that
you know the fight for the the world in

00:02:07.160 --> 00:02:07.170
you know the fight for the the world in
 

00:02:07.170 --> 00:02:08.839
you know the fight for the the world in
the next say 15-20 years is going to be

00:02:08.839 --> 00:02:08.849
the next say 15-20 years is going to be
 

00:02:08.849 --> 00:02:09.440
the next say 15-20 years is going to be
on water

00:02:09.440 --> 00:02:09.450
on water
 

00:02:09.450 --> 00:02:11.540
on water
let's look at energy another derivative

00:02:11.540 --> 00:02:11.550
let's look at energy another derivative
 

00:02:11.550 --> 00:02:13.970
let's look at energy another derivative
of what what power is all about so if

00:02:13.970 --> 00:02:13.980
of what what power is all about so if
 

00:02:13.980 --> 00:02:15.380
of what what power is all about so if
when we look at some of these demands

00:02:15.380 --> 00:02:15.390
when we look at some of these demands
 

00:02:15.390 --> 00:02:17.500
when we look at some of these demands
that in India has got extreme

00:02:17.500 --> 00:02:17.510
that in India has got extreme
 

00:02:17.510 --> 00:02:19.520
that in India has got extreme
capabilities in terms of what we could

00:02:19.520 --> 00:02:19.530
capabilities in terms of what we could
 

00:02:19.530 --> 00:02:22.220
capabilities in terms of what we could
do in these space to be able to achieve

00:02:22.220 --> 00:02:22.230
do in these space to be able to achieve
 

00:02:22.230 --> 00:02:24.140
do in these space to be able to achieve
what we would typically call a super bot

00:02:24.140 --> 00:02:24.150
what we would typically call a super bot
 

00:02:24.150 --> 00:02:27.080
what we would typically call a super bot
so I think it's in assets it's each one

00:02:27.080 --> 00:02:27.090
so I think it's in assets it's each one
 

00:02:27.090 --> 00:02:28.940
so I think it's in assets it's each one
of us in terms of our ability to believe

00:02:28.940 --> 00:02:28.950
of us in terms of our ability to believe
 

00:02:28.950 --> 00:02:31.400
of us in terms of our ability to believe
in oneself and say hey I think we are

00:02:31.400 --> 00:02:31.410
in oneself and say hey I think we are
 

00:02:31.410 --> 00:02:33.770
in oneself and say hey I think we are
you know a nation which which is very

00:02:33.770 --> 00:02:33.780
you know a nation which which is very
 

00:02:33.780 --> 00:02:36.050
you know a nation which which is very
proud of what we do and what we capable

00:02:36.050 --> 00:02:36.060
proud of what we do and what we capable
 

00:02:36.060 --> 00:02:38.300
proud of what we do and what we capable
of doing so I think self-belief and

00:02:38.300 --> 00:02:38.310
of doing so I think self-belief and
 

00:02:38.310 --> 00:02:40.339
of doing so I think self-belief and
believing in all the eject is that comma

00:02:40.339 --> 00:02:40.349
believing in all the eject is that comma
 

00:02:40.349 --> 00:02:42.830
believing in all the eject is that comma
away and then raising our internal

00:02:42.830 --> 00:02:42.840
away and then raising our internal
 

00:02:42.840 --> 00:02:44.089
away and then raising our internal
capabilities probably the best way to

00:02:44.089 --> 00:02:44.099
capabilities probably the best way to
 

00:02:44.099 --> 00:02:45.470
capabilities probably the best way to
look at what we could do as a nation

00:02:45.470 --> 00:02:45.480
look at what we could do as a nation
 

00:02:45.480 --> 00:02:52.190
look at what we could do as a nation
yeah so the other
