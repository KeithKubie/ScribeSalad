00:00:00.900 --> 00:00:02.667
- We're featuring my interview

00:00:02.667 --> 00:00:05.333
ocean voyager Nainoa Thompson.

00:00:05.333 --> 00:00:09.600
And I had to ask him how the
ancient Polynesians navigated

00:00:09.600 --> 00:00:14.333
2,400 miles from Hawaii
to Tahiti without being

00:00:14.333 --> 00:00:15.533
able to calculate longitude.

00:00:15.533 --> 00:00:17.500
Let's check it out.

00:00:17.500 --> 00:00:20.700
OK, imagine, imagine.

00:00:20.700 --> 00:00:22.867
You're standing on
the beach at Waikiki.

00:00:22.867 --> 00:00:26.500
You're looking over the
horizon to where Tahiti is.

00:00:26.500 --> 00:00:30.900
And now imagine you draw
one line like an arc

00:00:30.900 --> 00:00:33.133
to the west side of
Tahiti and the other line

00:00:33.133 --> 00:00:34.233
to the east side.

00:00:34.233 --> 00:00:35.233
That's your target.

00:00:35.233 --> 00:00:36.433
It's less than a degree.

00:00:36.433 --> 00:00:40.400
So your destination is
not in view, because it's

00:00:40.400 --> 00:00:41.700
far beyond your horizon.

00:00:41.700 --> 00:00:43.400
Over the horizon.

00:00:43.400 --> 00:00:47.300
So your destination
spans an angle

00:00:47.300 --> 00:00:49.066
from where you are standing.

00:00:49.066 --> 00:00:50.266
In Waikiki.

00:00:50.266 --> 00:00:53.100
And as long as you
navigate inside that angle,

00:00:53.100 --> 00:00:54.500
nothing else matters.
- Right.

00:00:54.500 --> 00:00:56.367
Because you're going to get to
your target on the other side.

00:00:56.367 --> 00:00:57.700
Really, really smart.

00:00:57.700 --> 00:00:59.033
Wait, wait.

00:00:59.033 --> 00:01:01.967
In fact, it seems to me your
angle can be wider than that

00:01:01.967 --> 00:01:05.033
because you just have
to get your destination

00:01:05.033 --> 00:01:07.467
within your horizon, and then
you can just dead reckon to it.

00:01:07.467 --> 00:01:08.600
Right, 15 miles east or west.

00:01:08.600 --> 00:01:09.567
Yeah, yeah, yeah, 15 miles.

00:01:09.567 --> 00:01:11.266
So you have a 30
mile, so it's really

00:01:11.266 --> 00:01:13.433
the width of 30
miles at the distance

00:01:13.433 --> 00:01:14.233
of where you're headed.

00:01:14.233 --> 00:01:15.033
Right.

00:01:15.033 --> 00:01:16.333
That's your angle.

00:01:16.333 --> 00:01:20.700
2,400 miles away though.

00:01:20.700 --> 00:01:22.500
So right, so that's 30.

00:01:22.500 --> 00:01:24.934
So that's narrow, but
still it's a known problem.

00:01:24.934 --> 00:01:25.734
Right.

00:01:25.734 --> 00:01:28.133
Yes.

00:01:28.133 --> 00:01:30.333
But there's so many
unknowns in the navigation

00:01:30.333 --> 00:01:31.867
that it's not a GPS.

00:01:31.867 --> 00:01:33.233
It's not a coordinate system.

00:01:33.233 --> 00:01:34.200
You don't have longitude.

00:01:34.200 --> 00:01:36.800
You need instruments
and you need

00:01:36.800 --> 00:01:39.400
tables, which we don't have.

00:01:39.400 --> 00:01:41.133
It's a dead reckoning system.

00:01:41.133 --> 00:01:43.166
So you only know where
you are by memorizing

00:01:43.166 --> 00:01:44.133
where you come from.

00:01:44.133 --> 00:01:45.667
If you memorize
where you come from,

00:01:45.667 --> 00:01:47.600
that meant you've
got to be awake.

00:01:47.600 --> 00:01:51.767
You know, we stay up
21, 22 hours a day.

00:01:51.767 --> 00:01:54.133
So it ain't easy.

00:01:54.133 --> 00:01:55.033
Here's what you do.

00:01:55.033 --> 00:01:55.734
Here's what you do.

00:01:58.266 --> 00:02:01.066
Slip this in your coat.

00:02:01.066 --> 00:02:02.133
Don't tell anybody, OK.

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:09.200
So that's that same
sextant, by the way.

00:02:09.200 --> 00:02:10.266
I see he didn't take it.

00:02:10.266 --> 00:02:11.066
No, he didn't take it.

00:02:11.066 --> 00:02:12.166
No, no, no.

00:02:12.166 --> 00:02:13.500
He doesn't need it,
that's the whole point.

00:02:13.500 --> 00:02:14.300
Yeah, thank you.

00:02:14.300 --> 00:02:15.834
He's like, I got this.
