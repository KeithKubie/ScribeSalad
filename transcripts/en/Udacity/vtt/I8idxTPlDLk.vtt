00:00:00.510 --> 00:00:05.790
Earlier, we mentioned the key role that
the CCD plays at transitions of care.

00:00:05.790 --> 00:00:06.980
In an earlier lesson,

00:00:06.980 --> 00:00:11.920
we saw this screenshot from an actual
commercial health IT system.

00:00:11.920 --> 00:00:15.935
Now you know that it does
medication reconciliation

00:00:15.935 --> 00:00:20.735
by comparing the medication
section of a CCD from another EHR,

00:00:20.735 --> 00:00:24.825
here on the left, with the medications
recorded in the patient's record in

00:00:24.825 --> 00:00:28.155
their physician's EHR,
here on the right.

00:00:28.155 --> 00:00:31.470
This is a very good example
of the power of standards

00:00:31.470 --> 00:00:36.130
incorporated into electronic clinical
documents, as a tool to improve care.
