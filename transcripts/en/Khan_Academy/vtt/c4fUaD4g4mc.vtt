00:00:00.820 --> 00:00:05.490
On Saturday, William's
parents gave birth to twins

00:00:05.490 --> 00:00:08.189
and named them
Nadia and Vanessa.

00:00:08.189 --> 00:00:14.030
When they were first born,
Nadia weighed 7.27 pounds

00:00:14.030 --> 00:00:21.720
and was 21.5 inches tall, and
Vanessa weighed 8.34 pounds.

00:00:21.720 --> 00:00:24.950
How much did the
babies weigh in total?

00:00:24.950 --> 00:00:28.980
So they tell us Nadia weighed
7.27 and Vanessa weighed 8.34.

00:00:28.980 --> 00:00:30.360
We have to add those up.

00:00:30.360 --> 00:00:32.009
And really, they
just gave us this.

00:00:32.009 --> 00:00:35.019
The length of Nadia at birth
really is a distraction,

00:00:35.019 --> 00:00:36.560
just so that we just
don't mindlessly

00:00:36.560 --> 00:00:37.760
add any numbers we see.

00:00:37.760 --> 00:00:40.360
So this is really
unnecessary information

00:00:40.360 --> 00:00:41.730
just to distract us.

00:00:41.730 --> 00:00:45.070
So we need to add Nadia's
birth weight plus Vanessa's.

00:00:45.070 --> 00:00:47.260
So it's 7.27.

00:00:47.260 --> 00:00:53.170
So 7.27 plus 8.34.

00:00:53.170 --> 00:00:55.460
And it's always important
that we line up the decimal.

00:00:55.460 --> 00:00:57.001
And I'd like to do
the decimal first.

00:00:57.001 --> 00:01:00.100
So it's 8.34.

00:01:00.100 --> 00:01:03.140
And we'll just add these two up.

00:01:03.140 --> 00:01:09.410
So 7 plus 4, and this is
really 7/100 plus 4/100

00:01:09.410 --> 00:01:14.950
is 11/100, which is the same
thing as 1/100 and 1/10.

00:01:14.950 --> 00:01:19.320
1/10 plus 2/10
plus 3/10 is 6/10.

00:01:19.320 --> 00:01:21.780
We've got our decimal
sign right over there.

00:01:21.780 --> 00:01:24.790
And then 7 plus 8 is
15, or you could even

00:01:24.790 --> 00:01:28.000
say it's five 1's and one 10.

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:28.710
And we're done.

00:01:28.710 --> 00:01:32.890
They weighed 15.61
pounds in total.
