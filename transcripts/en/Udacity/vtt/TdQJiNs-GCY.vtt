Let's take a closer look at full consciousness. Now, psychologists use two

00:00:03.793 --> 00:00:07.564
terms to describe it. First, do you remember when Susan asked if you've ever

00:00:07.564 --> 00:00:11.840
been so involved in an activity that you've completely lost track of time?

00:00:11.840 --> 00:00:15.420
Well, this is what psychologists call flow. Think of a sport, or a hobby, or

00:00:15.420 --> 00:00:20.030
just some activity that you're really good at doing. Your attention becomes so

00:00:20.030 --> 00:00:24.632
focused on this activity that time flies. Hours feel like minutes. You're so

00:00:24.632 --> 00:00:29.461
engaged that time doesn't even matter. The second and last example of full

00:00:29.461 --> 00:00:33.396
consciousness is mindfulness. This is when a person has a heightened sense of

00:00:33.396 --> 00:00:37.828
awareness, and is focusing on the present. So if you're being mindful you're

00:00:37.828 --> 00:00:41.041
actively paying attention to your immediate surroundings and what you're

00:00:41.041 --> 00:00:46.377
thinking. Research has actually shown that practicing mindfulness techniques

00:00:46.377 --> 00:00:49.557
can reduce stress levels and anxiety and it can actually be a really good

00:00:49.557 --> 00:00:52.275
treatment for depression...
