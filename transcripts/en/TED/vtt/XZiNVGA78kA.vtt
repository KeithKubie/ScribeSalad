00:00:12.900 --> 00:00:16.991
There's an ancient parable
about a farmer who lost his horse.

00:00:17.015 --> 00:00:20.389
And neighbors came over to say,
"Oh, that's too bad."

00:00:20.413 --> 00:00:23.782
And the farmer said,
"Good or bad, hard to say."

00:00:24.649 --> 00:00:30.159
Days later, the horse returns
and brings with it seven wild horses.

00:00:30.183 --> 00:00:33.800
And neighbors come over to say,
"Oh, that's so good!"

00:00:33.824 --> 00:00:38.929
And the farmer just shrugs
and says, "Good or bad, hard to say."

00:00:39.579 --> 00:00:43.651
The next day, the farmer's son
rides one of the wild horses,

00:00:43.675 --> 00:00:46.161
is thrown off and breaks his leg.

00:00:46.185 --> 00:00:49.490
And the neighbors say,
"Oh, that's terrible luck."

00:00:49.514 --> 00:00:53.621
And the farmer says,
"Good or bad, hard to say."

00:00:54.587 --> 00:00:57.258
Eventually, officers come
knocking on people's doors,

00:00:57.282 --> 00:00:59.941
looking for men to draft for an army,

00:00:59.965 --> 00:01:03.538
and they see the farmer's son and his leg
and they pass him by.

00:01:03.562 --> 00:01:06.118
And neighbors say,
"Ooh, that's great luck!"

00:01:06.142 --> 00:01:10.630
And the farmer says,
"Good or bad, hard to say."

00:01:11.136 --> 00:01:13.583
I first heard this story 20 years ago,

00:01:13.607 --> 00:01:16.194
and I have since applied it 100 times.

00:01:16.218 --> 00:01:18.143
Didn't get the job I wanted:

00:01:18.734 --> 00:01:20.143
good or bad, hard to say.

00:01:20.905 --> 00:01:23.274
Got the job I wanted:

00:01:23.298 --> 00:01:25.425
good or bad, hard to say.

00:01:25.972 --> 00:01:29.226
To me, the story is not about
looking on the bright side

00:01:29.250 --> 00:01:31.636
or waiting to see how things turn out.

00:01:32.055 --> 00:01:35.738
It's about how eager we can be
to label a situation,

00:01:35.762 --> 00:01:38.544
to put concrete around it by judging it.

00:01:38.901 --> 00:01:41.968
But reality is much more fluid,

00:01:41.992 --> 00:01:46.838
and good and bad are often
incomplete stories that we tell ourselves.

00:01:46.862 --> 00:01:49.252
The parable has been my warning

00:01:49.276 --> 00:01:52.900
that by gripping tightly
to the story of good or bad,

00:01:52.924 --> 00:01:56.678
I close down my ability
to truly see a situation.

00:01:56.702 --> 00:02:00.312
I learn more when I proceed
and loosen my grip

00:02:00.336 --> 00:02:03.634
and proceed openly
with curiosity and wonder.

00:02:04.415 --> 00:02:07.049
But seven years ago,

00:02:07.073 --> 00:02:09.172
when I was pregnant with my first child,

00:02:09.196 --> 00:02:12.016
I completely forgot this lesson.

00:02:12.471 --> 00:02:15.620
I believed I knew
wholeheartedly what was good.

00:02:15.644 --> 00:02:17.353
When it came to having kids,

00:02:17.377 --> 00:02:20.889
I thought that good
was some version of a superbaby,

00:02:20.913 --> 00:02:24.877
some ultrahealthy human
who possessed not a single flaw

00:02:24.901 --> 00:02:29.650
and would practically wear a cape
flying into her superhero future.

00:02:29.674 --> 00:02:34.421
I took DHA pills to ensure that my baby
had a super-high-functioning,

00:02:34.445 --> 00:02:35.730
supersmart brain,

00:02:35.754 --> 00:02:38.427
and I ate mostly organic food,

00:02:38.451 --> 00:02:41.006
and I trained for a medication-free labor,

00:02:41.030 --> 00:02:42.851
and I did many other things

00:02:42.875 --> 00:02:47.101
because I thought these things
would help me make not just a good baby,

00:02:47.125 --> 00:02:49.590
but the best baby possible.

00:02:50.693 --> 00:02:55.382
When my daughter Fiona was born,
she weighed 4 pounds, 12 ounces,

00:02:55.406 --> 00:02:58.182
or 2.15 kilograms.

00:02:58.514 --> 00:03:02.406
The pediatrician said there were only
two possible explanations

00:03:02.430 --> 00:03:04.048
for her tiny size.

00:03:04.072 --> 00:03:07.157
"Either," he said, "it's bad seed,"

00:03:07.744 --> 00:03:09.363
"or it's bad soil."

00:03:09.773 --> 00:03:14.616
And I wasn't so tired from labor
to lose the thread of his logic:

00:03:14.640 --> 00:03:16.935
my newborn, according to the doctor,

00:03:16.959 --> 00:03:18.653
was a bad plant.

00:03:19.873 --> 00:03:24.132
Eventually, I learned that my daughter
had an ultra-rare chromosomal condition

00:03:24.156 --> 00:03:26.172
called Wolf-Hirschhorn syndrome.

00:03:26.196 --> 00:03:29.400
She was missing a chunk
of her fourth chromosome.

00:03:29.830 --> 00:03:33.015
And although my daughter was good --

00:03:33.039 --> 00:03:34.396
she was alive,

00:03:34.420 --> 00:03:36.477
and she had brand new baby skin

00:03:36.501 --> 00:03:39.944
and the most aware onyx eyes --

00:03:39.968 --> 00:03:42.088
I also learned that people
with her syndrome

00:03:42.112 --> 00:03:45.406
have significant developmental
delays and disabilities.

00:03:45.430 --> 00:03:48.234
Some never learn to walk or talk.

00:03:48.747 --> 00:03:52.152
I did not have the equanimity
of the farmer.

00:03:52.176 --> 00:03:56.153
The situation looked
unequivocally bad to me.

00:03:56.177 --> 00:03:59.404
But here's where the parable is so useful,

00:03:59.428 --> 00:04:04.429
because for weeks after her diagnosis,
I felt gripped by despair,

00:04:04.453 --> 00:04:08.269
locked in the story
that all of this was tragic.

00:04:08.293 --> 00:04:12.058
Reality, though -- thankfully --
is much more fluid,

00:04:12.082 --> 00:04:14.672
and it has much more to teach.

00:04:15.413 --> 00:04:20.180
As I started to get to know
this mysterious person who was my kid,

00:04:20.204 --> 00:04:24.357
my fixed, tight story of tragedy loosened.

00:04:24.381 --> 00:04:26.750
It turned out my girl loved reggae,

00:04:26.774 --> 00:04:30.686
and she would smirk when my husband
would bounce her tiny body up and down

00:04:30.710 --> 00:04:31.890
to the rhythm.

00:04:31.914 --> 00:04:36.600
Her onyx eyes eventually turned
the most stunning Lake Tahoe blue,

00:04:36.624 --> 00:04:40.990
and she loved using them to gaze intently
into other people's eyes.

00:04:41.376 --> 00:04:45.183
At five months old, she could not
hold her head up like other babies,

00:04:45.207 --> 00:04:48.194
but she could hold this deep,
intent eye contact.

00:04:48.568 --> 00:04:52.876
One friend said, "She's the most
aware baby I've ever seen."

00:04:53.513 --> 00:04:57.478
But where I saw the gift
of her calm, attentive presence,

00:04:57.502 --> 00:05:01.855
an occupational therapist who came
over to our house to work with Fiona

00:05:01.879 --> 00:05:04.641
saw a child who was neurologically dull.

00:05:04.665 --> 00:05:07.941
This therapist was especially disappointed

00:05:07.965 --> 00:05:10.345
that Fiona wasn't rolling over yet,

00:05:10.369 --> 00:05:13.628
and so she told me we needed
to wake her neurology up.

00:05:13.652 --> 00:05:16.571
One day she leaned over
my daughter's body,

00:05:16.595 --> 00:05:18.089
took her tiny shoulders,

00:05:18.113 --> 00:05:20.977
jostled her and said, "Wake up! Wake up!"

00:05:21.738 --> 00:05:24.839
We had a few therapists
visit our house that first year,

00:05:24.863 --> 00:05:28.589
and they usually focused on what
they thought was bad about my kid.

00:05:28.613 --> 00:05:31.543
I was really happy when
Fiona started using her right hand

00:05:31.567 --> 00:05:34.296
to bully a dangling stuffed sheep,

00:05:34.320 --> 00:05:38.003
but the therapist was fixated
on my child's left hand.

00:05:38.027 --> 00:05:41.119
Fiona had a tendency
not to use this hand very often,

00:05:41.143 --> 00:05:44.011
and she would cross
the fingers on that hand.

00:05:44.035 --> 00:05:46.935
So the therapist said
we should devise a splint,

00:05:46.959 --> 00:05:51.104
which would rob my kid of the ability
to actually use those fingers,

00:05:51.128 --> 00:05:54.715
but it would at least force them
into some position that looked normal.

00:05:55.516 --> 00:05:58.476
In that first year, I was starting
to realize a few things.

00:05:58.500 --> 00:06:02.418
One: ancient parables aside,
my kid had some bad therapists.

00:06:02.442 --> 00:06:03.491
(Laughter)

00:06:03.515 --> 00:06:05.147
Two: I had a choice.

00:06:05.171 --> 00:06:09.265
Like a person offered to swallow
a red pill or a blue pill,

00:06:09.289 --> 00:06:12.898
I could choose to see
my daughter's differences as bad;

00:06:12.922 --> 00:06:16.250
I could strive toward the goal
that her therapists called,

00:06:16.274 --> 00:06:17.460
"You'd never know."

00:06:17.484 --> 00:06:20.954
They loved to pat themselves on the back
when they could say about a kid,

00:06:20.978 --> 00:06:25.580
"You'd never know he was 'delayed'
or 'autistic' or 'different.'"

00:06:25.604 --> 00:06:29.435
I could believe that the good path
was the path that erased

00:06:29.459 --> 00:06:31.648
as many differences as possible.

00:06:32.610 --> 00:06:35.418
Of course, this would have been
a disastrous pursuit,

00:06:35.442 --> 00:06:39.669
because at the cellular level,
my daughter had rare blueprints.

00:06:39.693 --> 00:06:42.228
She wasn't designed
to be like other people.

00:06:42.252 --> 00:06:43.968
She would lead a rare life.

00:06:44.465 --> 00:06:48.352
So, I had another choice:
I could drop my story

00:06:48.376 --> 00:06:53.658
that neurological differences
and developmental delays and disabilities

00:06:53.682 --> 00:06:54.841
were bad,

00:06:54.865 --> 00:07:00.761
which means I could also drop my story
that a more able-bodied life was better.

00:07:00.785 --> 00:07:05.688
I could release my cultural biases
about what made a life good or bad

00:07:05.712 --> 00:07:09.296
and simply watch
my daughter's life as it unfolded

00:07:09.320 --> 00:07:11.832
with openness and curiosity.

00:07:12.593 --> 00:07:14.648
One afternoon she was lying on her back,

00:07:14.672 --> 00:07:17.812
and she arched her back on the carpet

00:07:17.836 --> 00:07:20.788
stuck her tongue
out of the side of her mouth

00:07:20.812 --> 00:07:24.329
and managed to torque
her body onto her belly.

00:07:24.866 --> 00:07:27.553
Then she tipped over
and rolled back onto her back,

00:07:27.577 --> 00:07:30.702
and once there, she managed
to do it all over again,

00:07:30.726 --> 00:07:34.590
rolling and wiggling her 12-pound self
under a coffee table.

00:07:34.614 --> 00:07:37.362
At first, I thought
she'd gotten stuck there,

00:07:37.386 --> 00:07:42.499
but then I saw her reaching for something
that her eye had been on all along:

00:07:42.523 --> 00:07:44.169
a black electric cord.

00:07:44.626 --> 00:07:46.574
She was a year old.

00:07:46.598 --> 00:07:51.731
Other babies her age were for sure
pulling up to stand and toddling around,

00:07:51.755 --> 00:07:53.055
some of them.

00:07:53.897 --> 00:07:57.408
To some, my kid's situation looked bad:

00:07:57.432 --> 00:07:59.329
a one-year-old who could only roll.

00:07:59.353 --> 00:08:00.523
But screw that.

00:08:00.547 --> 00:08:05.247
My kid was enjoying the new,
limber freedom of mobility.

00:08:05.271 --> 00:08:06.421
I rejoiced.

00:08:07.326 --> 00:08:11.901
Then again, what I watched that afternoon
was a baby yanking on an electric cord,

00:08:11.925 --> 00:08:13.115
so you know,

00:08:13.139 --> 00:08:14.705
good or bad, hard to say.

00:08:14.729 --> 00:08:15.879
(Laughter)

00:08:16.967 --> 00:08:20.077
I started seeing
that when I released my grip

00:08:20.101 --> 00:08:22.444
about what made a life good or bad,

00:08:22.468 --> 00:08:26.373
I could watch my daughter's life unfold
and see what it was.

00:08:27.151 --> 00:08:28.555
It was beautiful,

00:08:28.579 --> 00:08:30.115
it was complicated,

00:08:31.176 --> 00:08:33.275
joyful, hard --

00:08:33.299 --> 00:08:39.028
in other words: just another expression
of the human experience.

00:08:40.490 --> 00:08:43.687
Eventually, my family and I moved
to a new state in America,

00:08:43.711 --> 00:08:47.604
and we got lucky with a brand-new
batch of therapists.

00:08:47.628 --> 00:08:51.066
They didn't focus on
all that was wrong with my kid.

00:08:51.090 --> 00:08:54.115
They didn't see her differences
as problems to fix.

00:08:54.139 --> 00:08:56.638
They acknowledged her limitations,

00:08:56.662 --> 00:08:59.321
but they also saw her strengths,

00:08:59.345 --> 00:09:02.176
and they celebrated her for who she was.

00:09:02.931 --> 00:09:06.439
Their goal wasn't to make Fiona
as normal as possible;

00:09:06.463 --> 00:09:10.018
their goal was simply to help her
be as independent as possible

00:09:10.042 --> 00:09:14.355
so that she could fulfill her potential,
however that looked for her.

00:09:14.883 --> 00:09:20.511
But the culture at large does not take
this open attitude about disabilities.

00:09:20.535 --> 00:09:24.003
We call congenital differences
"birth defects,"

00:09:24.027 --> 00:09:27.505
as though human beings
were objects on a factory line.

00:09:27.878 --> 00:09:30.181
We might offer pitying expressions

00:09:30.205 --> 00:09:33.503
when we learn that a colleague
had a baby with Down syndrome.

00:09:33.527 --> 00:09:37.535
We hail a blockbuster film
about a suicidal wheelchair user,

00:09:37.559 --> 00:09:40.954
despite the fact that actual
wheelchair users tell us

00:09:40.978 --> 00:09:44.223
that stereotype is unfair and damaging.

00:09:44.247 --> 00:09:49.362
And sometimes our medical institutions
decide what lives are not worth living.

00:09:49.386 --> 00:09:51.819
Such is the case with Amelia Rivera,

00:09:51.843 --> 00:09:54.052
a girl with my daughter's same syndrome.

00:09:54.076 --> 00:09:57.998
In 2012, a famous American
children's hospital

00:09:58.022 --> 00:10:02.622
initially denied Amelia the right
to a lifesaving kidney transplant

00:10:02.646 --> 00:10:04.610
because, according to their form,

00:10:04.634 --> 00:10:07.503
as it said, she was "mentally retarded."

00:10:07.527 --> 00:10:11.369
This is the way that the story
of disabilities as bad manifests

00:10:11.393 --> 00:10:12.819
in a culture.

00:10:12.843 --> 00:10:16.659
But there's a surprisingly
insidious counterstory --

00:10:16.683 --> 00:10:21.330
the story, especially, that people
with intellectual disabilities are good

00:10:21.354 --> 00:10:24.621
because they are here
to teach us something magical,

00:10:24.645 --> 00:10:28.953
or they are inherently angelic
and always sweet.

00:10:28.977 --> 00:10:32.352
You have heard this ableist trope before:

00:10:32.376 --> 00:10:36.252
the boy with Down syndrome
who's one of God's special children,

00:10:36.276 --> 00:10:40.105
or the girl with the walker
and the communication device

00:10:40.129 --> 00:10:41.869
who is a precious little angel.

00:10:42.422 --> 00:10:44.729
This story rears its head
in my daughter's life

00:10:44.753 --> 00:10:45.998
around Christmastime,

00:10:46.022 --> 00:10:48.406
when certain people get positively giddy

00:10:48.430 --> 00:10:51.636
at the thought of seeing her
in angel's wings and a halo

00:10:51.660 --> 00:10:53.088
at the pageant.

00:10:53.112 --> 00:10:58.568
The insinuation is that these people
don't experience the sticky complexities

00:10:58.592 --> 00:11:00.052
of being human.

00:11:00.457 --> 00:11:02.934
And although at times,
especially as a baby,

00:11:02.958 --> 00:11:06.147
my daughter has, in fact, looked angelic,

00:11:06.171 --> 00:11:08.505
she has grown into the type of kid

00:11:08.529 --> 00:11:11.814
who does the rascally things
that any other kid does,

00:11:11.838 --> 00:11:16.820
such as when she, at age four,
shoved her two-year-old sister.

00:11:17.643 --> 00:11:20.894
My girl deserves the right
to annoy the hell out of you,

00:11:20.918 --> 00:11:22.277
like any other kid.

00:11:23.532 --> 00:11:27.065
When we label a person tragic or angelic,

00:11:27.089 --> 00:11:29.179
bad or good,

00:11:29.203 --> 00:11:31.133
we rob them of their humanity,

00:11:31.750 --> 00:11:36.021
along with not only the messiness
and complexity that that title brings,

00:11:36.045 --> 00:11:38.624
but the rights and dignities as well.

00:11:40.228 --> 00:11:42.790
My girl does not exist to teach me things

00:11:42.814 --> 00:11:44.231
or any of us things,

00:11:44.255 --> 00:11:46.417
but she has indeed taught me:

00:11:46.441 --> 00:11:49.423
number one, how many
mozzarella cheese sticks

00:11:49.447 --> 00:11:52.915
a 22-pound human being
can consume in one day --

00:11:52.939 --> 00:11:55.488
which is five, for the record;

00:11:55.512 --> 00:12:00.703
and two, the gift of questioning
my culture's beliefs

00:12:00.727 --> 00:12:02.946
about what makes a life good

00:12:02.970 --> 00:12:04.587
and what makes life bad.

00:12:04.990 --> 00:12:07.966
If you had told me six years ago

00:12:07.990 --> 00:12:11.615
that my daughter would sometimes use
and iPad app to communicate,

00:12:11.639 --> 00:12:13.909
I might have thought that was sad.

00:12:14.644 --> 00:12:18.240
But now I recall the first day
I handed Fiona her iPad,

00:12:18.264 --> 00:12:20.981
loaded with a thousand words,

00:12:21.005 --> 00:12:26.143
each represented by a tiny little icon
or little square on her iPad app.

00:12:26.167 --> 00:12:29.305
And I recall how bold and hopeful it felt,

00:12:29.329 --> 00:12:34.463
even as some of her therapists said
that my expectations were way too high,

00:12:34.487 --> 00:12:37.823
that she would never be able
to hit those tiny targets.

00:12:38.276 --> 00:12:42.469
And I recall watching in awe
as she gradually learned

00:12:42.493 --> 00:12:44.662
to flex her little thumb

00:12:44.686 --> 00:12:47.738
and hit the buttons to say
words she loved,

00:12:47.762 --> 00:12:50.761
like "reggae" and "cheese"

00:12:50.785 --> 00:12:54.300
and a hundred other words she loved
that her mouth couldn't yet say.

00:12:55.216 --> 00:12:58.113
And then we had to teach her
less-fun words, prepositions --

00:12:58.137 --> 00:13:01.022
words like "of" and "on" and "in."

00:13:01.046 --> 00:13:03.316
And we worked on this for a few weeks.

00:13:03.340 --> 00:13:06.740
And then I recall sitting
at a dining room table

00:13:06.764 --> 00:13:08.745
with many relatives,

00:13:08.769 --> 00:13:11.879
and, apropos of absolutely nothing,

00:13:11.903 --> 00:13:15.328
Fiona used her iPad app to say,

00:13:15.352 --> 00:13:18.170
"poop in toilet."

00:13:18.194 --> 00:13:19.428
(Laughter)

00:13:20.168 --> 00:13:22.024
Good or bad, hard to say.

00:13:22.048 --> 00:13:23.198
(Laughter)

00:13:23.584 --> 00:13:25.961
My kid is human, that's all.

00:13:25.985 --> 00:13:27.559
And that is a lot.

00:13:28.268 --> 00:13:29.545
Thank you.

00:13:29.569 --> 00:13:33.401
(Applause)
