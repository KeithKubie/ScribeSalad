00:00:13.589 --> 00:00:19.490
James Vincenzo Capone, born in 1892, was 7
years old when his infamous brother, Al Capone,

00:00:19.490 --> 00:00:20.570
was born.

00:00:20.570 --> 00:00:24.640
Growing up in Brooklyn, James felt the city
life didn’t suit him and decided to head

00:00:24.640 --> 00:00:25.640
out west.

00:00:25.640 --> 00:00:29.930
As such, he left the family at the age of
16 to join the circus in 1908.

00:00:29.930 --> 00:00:34.250
Losing touch with his family, he traveled
throughout the Midwest going by the name “Richard

00:00:34.250 --> 00:00:37.859
Hart”, choosing to keep people from knowing
about his Italian heritage.

00:00:37.859 --> 00:00:42.170
Instead, he preferred people to think he was
Mexican or Native American.

00:00:42.170 --> 00:00:46.420
During this early period in his life, he became
fascinated with guns and would spend countless

00:00:46.420 --> 00:00:50.620
hours shooting at bottles and cans, soon becoming
an expert marksman.

00:00:50.620 --> 00:00:55.030
After World War I, he told people he had developed
this skill serving in the infantry in France.

00:00:55.030 --> 00:00:59.230
He also said that he rose to the rank of Lieutenant
and received the “sharpshooters” medal

00:00:59.230 --> 00:01:01.260
from General John J Pershing.

00:01:01.260 --> 00:01:05.129
However, later in his life, this military
service was called into question by local

00:01:05.129 --> 00:01:07.970
Legionaries who asked for proof of his claims.

00:01:07.970 --> 00:01:12.140
Being unable to provide any record of actually
being a serviceman, his military history is

00:01:12.140 --> 00:01:13.820
thought to have been made up.

00:01:13.820 --> 00:01:17.780
He eventually settled in Homer, Nebraska,
where he soon became Homer’s town marshal

00:01:17.780 --> 00:01:20.939
for two years followed by one year as a state
sheriff.

00:01:20.939 --> 00:01:23.500
Yes, Al Capone’s brother was a lawman.

00:01:23.500 --> 00:01:28.479
Not only that, after his stint as sheriff,
he chose to seek out more excitement by becoming

00:01:28.479 --> 00:01:30.119
a prohibition enforcement officer.

00:01:30.119 --> 00:01:35.299
It was at this same time that his brother,
Al, was rising in fame as a gangster in Chicago,

00:01:35.299 --> 00:01:37.869
particularly known for illegal smuggling of
liqueur.

00:01:37.869 --> 00:01:41.979
Mr. Hart led countless raids that ended in
numerous arrests and convictions.

00:01:41.979 --> 00:01:46.469
He soon became famous for his methods in which
he used disguises to enter towns undercover

00:01:46.469 --> 00:01:48.179
to bust local bootleggers.

00:01:48.179 --> 00:01:52.540
Due to his pair of pearl-handled pistols and
his ability as a marksman, the papers began

00:01:52.540 --> 00:01:56.259
calling him “Two Gun Hart” after several
sensational arrests.

00:01:56.259 --> 00:02:01.669
As his fame grew, he was hired by the U.S.
Indian Service where he soon developed a reputation

00:02:01.669 --> 00:02:03.829
of brutality among the natives.

00:02:03.829 --> 00:02:07.179
In one incident, he killed a local Native
American in a fight.

00:02:07.179 --> 00:02:11.270
After his arrest, it came to light that the
Native American was a bootlegger, so all charges

00:02:11.270 --> 00:02:12.270
were dropped.

00:02:12.270 --> 00:02:14.490
Two Gun did not escape the crime Scot free,
though.

00:02:14.490 --> 00:02:18.030
The murdered Native’s family, seeking retribution,
attempted to kill Hart.

00:02:18.030 --> 00:02:21.760
They were not successful, but did manage to
take one of his eyes.

00:02:21.760 --> 00:02:26.099
After several more such incidents, Two Gun’s
reputation was tarnished and he ended up almost

00:02:26.099 --> 00:02:27.790
blind and broke.

00:02:27.790 --> 00:02:31.680
Unable to handle his bills and facing the
prospect of being penniless, Hart chose to

00:02:31.680 --> 00:02:34.180
reach out to his wealthy brother in Chicago.

00:02:34.180 --> 00:02:38.439
Initially refusing to tell his wife and children
where he was going, Hart went to Chicago returning

00:02:38.439 --> 00:02:41.640
with a new suit and a roll of $100 dollar
bills.

00:02:41.640 --> 00:02:45.239
Finally, after one trip in which he went to
visit his mother, he revealed to his wife

00:02:45.239 --> 00:02:47.319
that his brother was Al Capone.

00:02:47.319 --> 00:02:52.019
In 1946, near the end of Al Capone’s life,
Hart allowed his son Harry to go with him

00:02:52.019 --> 00:02:54.129
to a Capone family cabin.

00:02:54.129 --> 00:02:56.280
There Harry was able to meet his famous uncle.

00:02:56.280 --> 00:03:00.359
Capone, who at the time was suffering from
complications of syphilis, had been released

00:03:00.359 --> 00:03:04.420
from his incarceration in Alcatraz and did
not have much of his memory in-tact.

00:03:04.420 --> 00:03:09.370
Less than a year later, Al would die, on January
25, 1947.

00:03:09.370 --> 00:03:13.939
In 1952, Richard Hart died of a heart attack
at his home in Homer Nebraska with his wife

00:03:13.939 --> 00:03:15.409
and son at his side.

00:03:15.409 --> 00:03:20.489
Attaining fame as a law man fighting the same
criminals his brother Al called peers.

00:03:20.489 --> 00:03:23.970
Bonus Facts:
• Arguably the most heinous crime attributed

00:03:23.970 --> 00:03:27.019
to Al Capone was the St. Valentine’s Day
Massacre.

00:03:27.019 --> 00:03:33.359
On February 14, 1929, 7 members of the “Bugs”
Moran mob were lined up against a garage and

00:03:33.359 --> 00:03:36.109
shot to death by rivals pretending to be police.

00:03:36.109 --> 00:03:41.939
While Al was in Florida at the time, it was
generally thought he was behind the incident.

00:03:41.939 --> 00:03:44.030
• Two Gun Hart had a bit of his brother
Al in him.

00:03:44.030 --> 00:03:47.520
Although it was never proven, when accepting
the position as town marshal, he was given

00:03:47.520 --> 00:03:51.310
keys to all of the businesses in the town
in case he needed to get into them during

00:03:51.310 --> 00:03:52.950
his nightly patrols.

00:03:52.950 --> 00:03:56.769
During this time, several businesses routinely
found that certain items in their stores would

00:03:56.769 --> 00:03:59.470
go missing.

00:03:59.470 --> 00:04:03.730
• Hart was a body-guard for the 30th President
of the United States, Calvin Coolidge, during

00:04:03.730 --> 00:04:07.489
the summer of 1927.

00:04:07.489 --> 00:04:10.349
• Scarface was the most well-known nickname
of Al Capone.

00:04:10.349 --> 00:04:14.680
The scars were given to him during a fight
in which he insulted a mobster Frank Gallulcio’s

00:04:14.680 --> 00:04:18.870
sister telling her, “Honey, you have a nice
ass and I mean that as a compliment.”

00:04:18.870 --> 00:04:23.170
Capone’s closest friends called him “Snorky”.

00:04:23.170 --> 00:04:27.330
• Before Al Capone was transferred to Alcatraz,
he was at the U.S. Penitentiary in Atlanta

00:04:27.330 --> 00:04:28.330
Georgia.

00:04:28.330 --> 00:04:31.639
He was said to live like a king because he
always had more socks, bed sheets and underwear

00:04:31.639 --> 00:04:33.030
then the other prisoners.

00:04:33.030 --> 00:04:36.460
This was made possible because he had a hollowed
out the handle of his tennis racket and had

00:04:36.460 --> 00:04:39.930
hidden several thousand dollars in it with
which he used to purchase the bounty from

00:04:39.930 --> 00:04:53.530
others in the clink.
