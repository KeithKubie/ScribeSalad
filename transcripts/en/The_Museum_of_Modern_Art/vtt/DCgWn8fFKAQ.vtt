00:00:00.669 --> 00:00:05.280
Artists have taken raw material and created masterpieces. Modern artists have taken a

00:00:05.280 --> 00:00:10.500
bed, a teacup and a bicycle wheel and done
the same. This video is called Transforming

00:00:10.500 --> 00:00:17.869
Everyday Objects. A theme we will explore
using three works. This is Marcel Duchamp's

00:00:17.869 --> 00:00:23.949
Bicycle Wheel. Duchamp created it in 1913
and it has been in MoMA's collection for almost

00:00:23.949 --> 00:00:28.590
fifty years. It looks a lot like a bicycle
wheel on a stool because it's a bicycle wheel

00:00:28.590 --> 00:00:33.690
on a stool. But much more interesting than
the way it looks is the ideas associated with

00:00:33.690 --> 00:00:39.280
this work. It was one of many works Duchamp
called Readymades. A shovel, a bottle rack,

00:00:39.280 --> 00:00:44.649
a hat rack, a coat rack and a bicycle wheel.
Readymades challenged every definition of

00:00:44.649 --> 00:00:50.719
art ever. Art is handmade by the artist. It's
a normal bicycle wheel, it's a normal stool.

00:00:50.719 --> 00:00:56.019
These are already made objects. Art is beautiful.
If you want to look at a bicycle wheel upside

00:00:56.019 --> 00:01:01.260
down, stuck in a stool and find that beautiful,
it's possible but I think we're on the wrong

00:01:01.260 --> 00:01:06.659
track. Duchamp in fact criticized so many
modern artists as being in his words, retinal.

00:01:06.659 --> 00:01:11.359
In other words, eye candy. Something to look
at. And if you introduce your taste, you go

00:01:11.359 --> 00:01:20.640
back to the old ideals of taste and taste
is the great enemy of art. Of course, Duchamp's

00:01:20.640 --> 00:01:25.439
own taste is critical here. Duchamp's a trouble
maker. We're talking about an artist who questions

00:01:25.439 --> 00:01:30.679
every single aspect of everything that is
stated as a fact. Duchamp was forcing the

00:01:30.679 --> 00:01:40.369
art world to define what was art. His readymades
paved the way for modern art for decades.

00:01:40.369 --> 00:01:44.429
Twenty years after Duchamp tried to shock
the world with a bicycle wheel, Meret Oppenheim

00:01:44.429 --> 00:01:50.909
was about to do the same with a teacup. In
1936, after having tea with Pablo Picasso

00:01:50.909 --> 00:01:59.710
and Dora Maar, returns to her studio and creates
this. This object was created at sort of this

00:01:59.710 --> 00:02:04.039
perfect storm moment. There were all these
artists looking at the world in a totally

00:02:04.039 --> 00:02:08.410
new way. Oppenheim, a 22-year old art student,
had already caught the attention of Andre

00:02:08.410 --> 00:02:14.480
Breton, the founder of Surrealism. Breton
and the Surrealists believed there was a crisis.

00:02:14.480 --> 00:02:20.700
Society had become stuck. They believed Surrealism
could shock people out of the limits of reality.

00:02:20.700 --> 00:02:26.010
As Breton put it, "we must not hesitate to
bewilder sensation." An iron with nails. A

00:02:26.010 --> 00:02:33.290
metronome with an eye. A fur-covered teacup.
The idea that, if you alter an object, it

00:02:33.290 --> 00:02:39.040
alters your perception of what that object
is. Oppenheim's teacup was viewed as threatening,

00:02:39.040 --> 00:02:45.640
repulsive. A woman even fainted. Breton declared
it the perfect Surrealist object. Oppenheim

00:02:45.640 --> 00:02:49.590
claimed, "it was a fluke...I had been making
fur-covered jewelry to make a little money.

00:02:49.590 --> 00:02:53.269
I showed a piece to Picasso and Dora Maar
and they joked that anything could be covered

00:02:53.269 --> 00:03:03.909
in fur. Today, Meret Oppenheim's fluke remains
the definitive Surrealist object. Twenty years

00:03:03.909 --> 00:03:10.549
later in New York, art was being very serious.
It was called Abstract Expressionism. It was

00:03:10.549 --> 00:03:19.180
brooding. It was personal. Enter Robert Rauschenberg.
You have to have a lot of time to feel sorry

00:03:19.180 --> 00:03:24.579
for yourself if you're going to be a good
abstract expressionist. And this was his response

00:03:24.579 --> 00:03:29.719
to Abstract Expressionism. He called it "Bed,"
because it was his quilt and pillow. It was

00:03:29.719 --> 00:03:34.980
called art because it was on the wall. "Painting
relates to both art and life. I try to act

00:03:34.980 --> 00:03:39.650
in the gap between the two." Critics didn't
know what to call it. Was it a painting? was

00:03:39.650 --> 00:03:45.219
it a sculpture? Rauschenberg ended up calling
it a combine. "It was the economy. I didn't

00:03:45.219 --> 00:03:50.319
have anything to paint on." Rauschenberg painted
on quilts, pillows, newspapers, bald eagles,

00:03:50.319 --> 00:03:55.219
garbage, pictures. He helped art to be more
than just paint on a canvas. Now it could

00:03:55.219 --> 00:04:02.170
be, well, a bed on a wall. "Bed." "Object."
And "Bicycle Wheel." Transforming everyday

00:04:02.170 --> 00:04:02.830
objects.
