00:00:02.068 --> 00:00:03.970
- I got so drunk that I

00:00:05.105 --> 00:00:07.240
participated in the
dancing contest,

00:00:07.240 --> 00:00:08.508
(audience laughing)

00:00:08.508 --> 00:00:12.545
and I was so drunk that
I won the dance contest.

00:00:12.545 --> 00:00:15.215
(dubstep music)

00:00:28.561 --> 00:00:31.631 align:start size:84% position:16%
- Welcome to This is
Not Happening presents
One Crazy Night.

00:00:31.631 --> 00:00:34.000
So this is what we do,
our bunch of comedians

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:36.002
tell stories about
a similar subject.

00:00:36.002 --> 00:00:37.337
So this is just one crazy night.

00:00:37.337 --> 00:00:38.738
Ladies and gentlemen,
my friend and yours,

00:00:38.738 --> 00:00:40.640 align:start size:94% position:6%
Mr. Doug Benson everybody,
let him hear it.

00:00:40.640 --> 00:00:43.476
(audience cheers)

00:00:46.046 --> 00:00:47.380
- Hey everybody.

00:00:48.581 --> 00:00:51.451
So a long time ago,
I went on a cruise

00:00:52.719 --> 00:00:54.421
when I was a young comedian.

00:00:54.421 --> 00:00:56.756
It was called the Improv
at Sea, like, Bud Friedman

00:00:56.756 --> 00:00:58.691 align:start size:84% position:16%
did this thing where
they did a series

00:00:58.691 --> 00:01:01.194
of comedy shows
(audience laughs)

00:01:01.194 --> 00:01:04.631 align:start position:0%
on cruise ships and they change
up the comedians every week

00:01:04.631 --> 00:01:08.334
like it was a comedy club and
they even brought in a fake

00:01:08.334 --> 00:01:09.869 align:start size:81% position:19%
brick wall
(audience laughs)

00:01:09.869 --> 00:01:12.705
that was just made
out of cardboard

00:01:12.705 --> 00:01:15.041 align:start position:0%
that they would just put behind
you so everyone would know

00:01:15.041 --> 00:01:16.776
okay yes, this is
stand-up comedy.

00:01:16.776 --> 00:01:19.045 align:start size:97% position:3%
We know it is because there's
a brick wall behind you.

00:01:19.045 --> 00:01:20.280
(audience laughs)

00:01:20.280 --> 00:01:21.581
And they treat you
like a passenger

00:01:21.581 --> 00:01:24.384
when you're a comedian
on these cruise ships.

00:01:24.384 --> 00:01:27.287
You just have a room with
everybody else and you eat

00:01:27.287 --> 00:01:30.590 align:start position:0%
with everybody, so that's weird
if you have a shitty show.

00:01:30.590 --> 00:01:33.393 align:start size:94% position:6%
Like, the next day you're
in line at the buffet

00:01:33.393 --> 00:01:34.861 align:start size:84% position:16%
with these people that
didn't get anything

00:01:34.861 --> 00:01:37.063
that you were saying
and hated your act.

00:01:37.063 --> 00:01:39.799 align:start size:94% position:6%
But they're usually pretty
friendly face-to-face

00:01:39.799 --> 00:01:42.368 align:start size:97% position:3%
and they're having a
buffet, so that's exciting.

00:01:42.368 --> 00:01:45.071 align:start size:81% position:19%
So...
(audience laughs)

00:01:45.071 --> 00:01:48.908
I'm on this cruise ship
and one of the options

00:01:48.908 --> 00:01:51.644
you can do during the
day is you can go on

00:01:51.644 --> 00:01:54.647
what they call, the
yellowbird cruise.

00:01:54.647 --> 00:01:57.717
The idea of the yellowbird
cruise is you get on this big

00:01:57.717 --> 00:02:01.154 align:start size:97% position:3%
catamaran thingy and they
take you to a private island

00:02:01.154 --> 00:02:02.489 align:start size:84% position:16%
and there's a
place where you can

00:02:02.489 --> 00:02:04.524
snorkel and jet-ski and whatnot.

00:02:04.524 --> 00:02:07.127
All for extra fees
that keep piling up.

00:02:07.127 --> 00:02:08.828
(audience laughs)

00:02:08.828 --> 00:02:13.233
In that price you also
got booze, free booze.

00:02:13.233 --> 00:02:15.668
And people just get
crazy drinking this

00:02:15.668 --> 00:02:18.037
yellowbird punch, they called it

00:02:18.037 --> 00:02:20.039
because it was the
yellowbird cruise.

00:02:20.039 --> 00:02:23.042 align:start size:94% position:6%
It's like a thousand-proof
or something like that.

00:02:23.042 --> 00:02:25.411
I was just throwing them back.

00:02:25.411 --> 00:02:27.947
So then we get to the island
and then I do some drunken

00:02:27.947 --> 00:02:31.551 align:start size:88% position:13%
snorkeling and
jet-skiing and whatnot.

00:02:31.551 --> 00:02:34.821
Which, in retrospect,
was crazy dangerous.

00:02:34.821 --> 00:02:36.923 align:start size:84% position:16%
(audience laughs)
And then I get back on

00:02:36.923 --> 00:02:40.493
the yellowbird cruise,
and on the way back,

00:02:41.628 --> 00:02:44.497
they decide to have
a dance contest.

00:02:45.932 --> 00:02:48.101
And I got so drunk that I

00:02:51.304 --> 00:02:53.940 align:start size:81% position:19%
participated in
the dance contest.

00:02:53.940 --> 00:02:58.011
And I was so drunk, that
I won the dance contest.

00:02:58.011 --> 00:02:59.779
(audience applause and laughter)

00:02:59.779 --> 00:03:01.181
Thank you very much.

00:03:01.181 --> 00:03:04.551 align:start size:94% position:6%
And the prize for
winning the dance contest

00:03:04.551 --> 00:03:08.154
was a giant bowl of
yellowbird punch.

00:03:08.154 --> 00:03:10.390 align:start size:97% position:3%
(audience laughs)
That they just present to you

00:03:10.390 --> 00:03:13.159 align:start position:0%
and you've got five more
minutes of the ride back to the

00:03:13.159 --> 00:03:17.530
boat to drink this giant bowl
of punch, and I obliged them.

00:03:17.530 --> 00:03:20.800
So that's pretty much the
last thing that I remember.

00:03:20.800 --> 00:03:23.703 align:start size:81% position:19%
(audience laughs)
So...

00:03:23.703 --> 00:03:26.239
The rest of the story was
told to me by my friend

00:03:26.239 --> 00:03:30.276
Scott, who was also a comedian
on the ship, very funny dude

00:03:30.276 --> 00:03:34.047 align:start position:0%
who started calling my room
when he thought that I was back

00:03:34.047 --> 00:03:36.649
on the ship after my excursion.

00:03:38.785 --> 00:03:41.554
He got a busy signal and so
eventually he's just like,

00:03:41.554 --> 00:03:43.957
well, I'll just go by his
room and see what's up.

00:03:43.957 --> 00:03:46.359
It's weird that he hasn't been

00:03:46.359 --> 00:03:48.695 align:start size:84% position:16%
able to answer his
phone for a long time.

00:03:48.695 --> 00:03:53.533 align:start size:97% position:3%
And he went to my room,
and I was passed out, naked

00:03:53.533 --> 00:03:54.801
(audience laughs)

00:03:54.801 --> 00:03:57.837
on the bed, on top of
the covers or whatever.

00:03:57.837 --> 00:04:01.174
And there was a bottle
of asprin or something

00:04:01.174 --> 00:04:03.109 align:start size:84% position:16%
that was dumped over
on the end table.

00:04:03.109 --> 00:04:06.212 align:start size:88% position:13%
And the phone was off
the hook, and I was just

00:04:06.212 --> 00:04:08.181 align:start size:94% position:6%
laying there, splayed out.
(audience laughs)

00:04:08.181 --> 00:04:10.450
And my friend Scott is like,

00:04:10.450 --> 00:04:12.785
he was like a huge
practical joker.

00:04:12.785 --> 00:04:16.122
So when he walked in on me,
he had a great opportunity.

00:04:16.122 --> 00:04:18.625
There's a million jokes
he could've played on me.

00:04:18.625 --> 00:04:23.396
And he's the kind of guy that
would smell his own smelly

00:04:23.396 --> 00:04:27.467
gym sock, like take a big
whiff of it, and then say,

00:04:27.467 --> 00:04:30.069 align:start size:84% position:16%
"This is amazing, this
smells like steak."

00:04:30.069 --> 00:04:31.304
(audience laughs)

00:04:31.304 --> 00:04:33.206
And then hold it
out for a friend,

00:04:33.206 --> 00:04:35.675 align:start size:84% position:16%
and they would
sniff it and he said

00:04:35.675 --> 00:04:38.878
one dude almost passed out
from how horrible it was.

00:04:38.878 --> 00:04:40.947 align:start size:97% position:3%
(audience laughs)
This is was this guys is like.

00:04:40.947 --> 00:04:45.084 align:start size:97% position:3%
And yet, he still just
closed the door to my cabin,

00:04:45.084 --> 00:04:49.289
and went back to his cabin and
then told me about it later.

00:04:49.289 --> 00:04:51.691 align:start size:97% position:3%
And I still had a good
laugh, though, thinking about

00:04:51.691 --> 00:04:55.361
when the cabin door was
swinging open and shut

00:04:55.361 --> 00:04:58.965
and all the people that had
seen me do comedy on the ship

00:04:58.965 --> 00:05:01.000
were like, cruising by my room

00:05:01.000 --> 00:05:03.002
and just seeing...

00:05:03.002 --> 00:05:04.237
Seeing my butt hole.

00:05:04.237 --> 00:05:05.705
(audience laughs)

00:05:05.705 --> 00:05:08.074 align:start size:94% position:6%
Thank you guys so much
for letting me share that.

00:05:08.074 --> 00:05:08.908 align:start size:84% position:16%
(audience applause)
(dubstep music)

00:05:08.908 --> 00:05:10.176
Enjoy the rest.

00:05:13.713 --> 00:05:15.715
