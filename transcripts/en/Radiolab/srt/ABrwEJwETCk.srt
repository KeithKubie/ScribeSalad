1
00:00:01,290 --> 00:00:02,310
Listening to radiolab

2
00:00:03,430 --> 00:00:05,740
radio from W. N y.

3
00:00:09,940 --> 00:00:13,320
S. C. E. N. N. P. R. Maybe all of
us can sit on the couch. You can do,

4
00:00:13,380 --> 00:00:14,770
I can rock and pull that chair over.

5
00:00:15,560 --> 00:00:17,800
So we're going to start with
the story from my producer,

6
00:00:17,801 --> 00:00:22,120
Pat Walters about a couple,
oh my word. It's the lady.

7
00:00:22,210 --> 00:00:26,380
I'm Janet. This is the guy, I don't
need you to introduce yourself.

8
00:00:26,381 --> 00:00:29,470
That's usually the thing we do, but
we're not telling people who you are.

9
00:00:29,680 --> 00:00:32,800
We're going to call him Kevin. Kevin,
yeah, yeah, yeah. That's, yeah,

10
00:00:32,801 --> 00:00:34,900
that's my name. That's suspicious at all.

11
00:00:35,290 --> 00:00:36,430
It's not as real name.

12
00:00:36,760 --> 00:00:38,800
I'll make sense why we're not
using his real name in a second.

13
00:00:39,660 --> 00:00:44,640
Okay. You know, so this one starts a
few summers ago. It was July, 2006.

14
00:00:44,760 --> 00:00:47,380
Jan and Kevin were at home and uh,

15
00:00:47,490 --> 00:00:51,810
some people you don't know show
up and maybe out start with you

16
00:00:51,910 --> 00:00:54,940
when they show up at their
door. So we were, it was a,

17
00:00:54,970 --> 00:00:57,850
we were getting ready to go down
the shore. It was a Friday. So we,

18
00:00:57,851 --> 00:01:00,340
so we're in the kitchen and,
and they come to the back door.

19
00:01:00,450 --> 00:01:02,610
I thought the, I thought
that they were fundraising.

20
00:01:02,611 --> 00:01:05,460
I thought they might've been firemen
just by, you know, the, the blue shirt,

21
00:01:05,461 --> 00:01:08,280
the blue shirt, and then realized
that, uh, that they were,

22
00:01:08,430 --> 00:01:09,750
they were law enforcement

23
00:01:10,850 --> 00:01:11,630
[inaudible]

24
00:01:11,630 --> 00:01:15,890
two women and a, I think two men more
came up from around the, you know,

25
00:01:15,891 --> 00:01:18,110
the side of the house and
they show us their badges.

26
00:01:18,380 --> 00:01:21,050
Were they cops or they
were homeland security.

27
00:01:22,570 --> 00:01:25,930
They took me outside and they kept me
and they asked me to stay in the kitchen

28
00:01:26,530 --> 00:01:29,500
and they had a, a woman with me.
I didn't know what was going on.

29
00:01:29,501 --> 00:01:30,334
Nobody said anything.

30
00:01:30,370 --> 00:01:35,080
What are they saying to you on
the porch? Meanwhile, when they,

31
00:01:35,110 --> 00:01:39,850
when they showed up, like out to the
door, you said, you know why we're here.

32
00:01:39,851 --> 00:01:41,650
I said, yeah, I do. I was expecting you

33
00:01:43,170 --> 00:01:43,660
[inaudible]

34
00:01:43,660 --> 00:01:45,550
and I showed them where everything was.

35
00:01:48,830 --> 00:01:50,690
This story about Kevin and his wife,

36
00:01:50,691 --> 00:01:55,490
Janet inspired us to do the entire hour
because one of the most basic things

37
00:01:55,491 --> 00:01:59,000
that we do as people is we
judge, we judge one another,

38
00:01:59,170 --> 00:02:00,920
could judge what's right,
judge what's wrong.

39
00:02:00,950 --> 00:02:02,600
But this story and the two that follow,

40
00:02:03,110 --> 00:02:06,920
they will make you judge how you judge
or at least they had that effect on us.

41
00:02:08,110 --> 00:02:12,890
We're calling our show, blame them.

42
00:02:12,891 --> 00:02:16,370
Jad Abumrad I'm Robert Krulwich and
we'll go back to bat. Before we do,

43
00:02:16,670 --> 00:02:21,050
you should know that this show contains
some graphic difficult descriptions in a

44
00:02:21,051 --> 00:02:24,260
few spots. If you're not in the
mood or if you have kids around,

45
00:02:24,920 --> 00:02:26,060
you might want to sit this one out.

46
00:02:26,590 --> 00:02:30,010
Okay. So what happened in that
first scene and what happens next?

47
00:02:30,150 --> 00:02:32,790
Only makes sense. If we
go back a little first

48
00:02:34,530 --> 00:02:38,250
about 15 years, it's just an ordinary day.

49
00:02:38,310 --> 00:02:40,860
Kevin's going home from work and um,

50
00:02:41,040 --> 00:02:46,040
I was driving home going about 65 70 in
the fast lane when suddenly there was a

51
00:02:49,291 --> 00:02:51,480
thump in my chest.

52
00:02:53,460 --> 00:02:58,020
Then he just a heat boating. After that,

53
00:02:58,021 --> 00:02:59,920
he said suddenly he had this thickness

54
00:03:00,010 --> 00:03:04,120
in my tongue. In my throat than
about taste in his mouth. Then

55
00:03:05,540 --> 00:03:08,900
my hearing faded out. Any thoughts?

56
00:03:11,260 --> 00:03:16,100
It's back when I finally did come to, uh,

57
00:03:16,440 --> 00:03:19,710
he sees his car smashed into the
side of an apartment building.

58
00:03:19,740 --> 00:03:22,950
I do recall the officers telling,
you know, you've been in an accident,

59
00:03:22,951 --> 00:03:23,580
you've been in an,

60
00:03:23,580 --> 00:03:28,020
and he remembers one of them insisted
that he smelled alcohol and I was talking

61
00:03:28,021 --> 00:03:32,070
through clenched teeth cause I had
bit my tongue and uh, and my cheeks.

62
00:03:32,340 --> 00:03:36,800
I was saying over and over again, I had
a seizure, I had a seizure. [inaudible]

63
00:03:40,170 --> 00:03:43,830
Kevin's got epilepsy. He's had
it since he was a teenager,

64
00:03:44,400 --> 00:03:46,470
but two years before this all happened,

65
00:03:46,471 --> 00:03:50,490
he'd had surgery to remove the part of
his brain that was causing the seizures

66
00:03:51,030 --> 00:03:52,770
and it seemed to have worked.

67
00:03:52,771 --> 00:03:57,771
He was doing great and essentially wasn't
having seizures anymore until suddenly

68
00:03:57,960 --> 00:03:58,793
you,

69
00:03:58,930 --> 00:04:02,140
he was last year license. I
lost my license for a year.

70
00:04:02,290 --> 00:04:06,520
Things had kind of taken a nosedive.
Like here he is, he's 35 years old.

71
00:04:06,550 --> 00:04:07,780
I'm living with my brother,

72
00:04:07,840 --> 00:04:12,840
I'm divorced and I have to call my daddy
and ask him now to drive me to and from

73
00:04:13,751 --> 00:04:18,670
work and you think I need to do
something. This is not sustainable. No,

74
00:04:18,760 --> 00:04:20,290
no, don't, don't need that.

75
00:04:20,500 --> 00:04:25,000
So I walked into the office as HR person
where he works for a list of all the

76
00:04:25,001 --> 00:04:27,400
employees, give me a list of
everybody and where they're from.

77
00:04:27,430 --> 00:04:31,960
So she pulled it up, I go down the list
and I get to Janet Woodruff, Bloomfield,

78
00:04:32,230 --> 00:04:36,850
only one that's really close to me five
minutes away. So I walk to her cube,

79
00:04:37,390 --> 00:04:40,390
knocked on the, on the wall and uh,

80
00:04:40,480 --> 00:04:45,380
introduced myself like, Hey, my name
is Kevin. I also work here. I've,

81
00:04:45,660 --> 00:04:49,390
I've got this thing though. It's
kind of awkward. I, I can't drive.

82
00:04:49,450 --> 00:04:52,780
And I was wondering if you'd
give me a ride. And uh,

83
00:04:53,560 --> 00:04:54,490
she said yes.

84
00:04:58,580 --> 00:04:58,680
[inaudible]

85
00:04:58,680 --> 00:05:01,590
I really passed by his street.
I mean, on the way it works.

86
00:05:01,591 --> 00:05:04,890
So it was like right on history pretty
much. But I made it clear, you know,

87
00:05:04,891 --> 00:05:07,980
I'll do it when I can. And as they
drove together, they started talking,

88
00:05:07,981 --> 00:05:09,810
finding out a little bit
more about each other.

89
00:05:11,360 --> 00:05:15,240
Notice pretty quickly we liked the same
music and that was unique because I sort

90
00:05:15,241 --> 00:05:18,330
of liked music that was
probably more in his error.

91
00:05:18,480 --> 00:05:21,900
Kevin was seven years older than Jan.
What kind of music are you listening to?

92
00:05:22,200 --> 00:05:24,900
Jackson Brown, mostly. Lot of
Jackson Brown, James Taylor

93
00:05:26,680 --> 00:05:31,290
[inaudible] um, funny rate.
It's a little, you know,

94
00:05:31,320 --> 00:05:34,320
Elton John, they found themselves

95
00:05:36,320 --> 00:05:37,320
singing along to the lyrics.

96
00:05:37,350 --> 00:05:42,090
You cannot sing with somebody day in
and day out and not have something

97
00:05:42,390 --> 00:05:42,600
happened.

98
00:05:42,600 --> 00:05:45,450
We wound up as a spring came, you know,
it's getting nice out. So now it's like,

99
00:05:45,451 --> 00:05:47,520
well let's not go home. Let's
go out for a beer after work.

100
00:05:47,550 --> 00:05:49,890
We're becoming good friends.
We liked each other.

101
00:05:50,090 --> 00:05:52,560
But for Kevin it was a little
more serious than that.

102
00:05:52,740 --> 00:05:57,740
I'm thinking about her starting to wake
up at night and one day in as Jenna is

103
00:05:57,950 --> 00:05:58,340
dropping

104
00:05:58,340 --> 00:06:00,350
him off, Kevin turns to
her and he says, Hey,

105
00:06:00,351 --> 00:06:02,510
I really appreciate what you've done
for me. Let me take you to dinner.

106
00:06:02,540 --> 00:06:05,840
Just as friends, just as
friends. Jen said, sure.

107
00:06:06,110 --> 00:06:09,650
So May 30th, 1992 Highland pavilion.

108
00:06:10,010 --> 00:06:11,320
Nicest restaurant in town,

109
00:06:11,360 --> 00:06:13,670
so your friends takes you
to a four star restaurant.

110
00:06:13,790 --> 00:06:17,360
You're thinking right away he thinks this
is a date or going on a date. Come on.

111
00:06:17,361 --> 00:06:21,530
So now on panic stricken, we have our
dinner, we leave. We had a wonderful time.

112
00:06:21,700 --> 00:06:21,770
Sure.

113
00:06:21,770 --> 00:06:25,850
He drops me off and I handed her
the poem. What did the poem say?

114
00:06:25,980 --> 00:06:30,290
You still have it? Yeah, I do.
Okay. This is a little slower.

115
00:06:31,010 --> 00:06:33,050
Each time we sing on the way home,

116
00:06:33,350 --> 00:06:38,350
I pray that traffic backs up so we can
sing together just a little longer and

117
00:06:38,571 --> 00:06:43,571
the harmony can go on forever and each
time we reach my door I feel robbed

118
00:06:44,450 --> 00:06:49,040
because we're always in mid song
or mid thought. If only I could.

119
00:06:49,070 --> 00:06:51,360
He gets out and goes inside
and probably thinks, ah, Sam.

120
00:06:51,440 --> 00:06:52,191
They gave her that poem.

121
00:06:52,191 --> 00:06:56,390
She's going to be so smitten
with me and you go home and what

122
00:06:56,740 --> 00:06:59,890
want to throw up. I just
thought, Oh God, I, you know,

123
00:07:00,030 --> 00:07:03,490
next day I just looked at him and
said, listen, we got to clarify.

124
00:07:03,550 --> 00:07:06,940
This is clearly just going
to be a friendship. He was
seven years older than me.

125
00:07:06,941 --> 00:07:11,410
He had these, uh, brain, uh, you
know, surgery. He has epilepsy,

126
00:07:11,620 --> 00:07:14,440
he's divorced. He has
two children in here.

127
00:07:15,290 --> 00:07:19,960
You're catching the compassion here
too. I'm trying and he's just like,

128
00:07:19,990 --> 00:07:22,590
I'm not asking you to marry me. I'm
asking you to go out on a few days.

129
00:07:22,610 --> 00:07:25,400
Exactly. If you go out with me like
four times in the next six months,

130
00:07:25,850 --> 00:07:26,690
I'm ahead of the game.

131
00:07:26,750 --> 00:07:30,260
He just handled it and I don't think it
was long at all. I can't even remember.

132
00:07:30,261 --> 00:07:32,990
But it wasn't long at all
before we were like a couple

133
00:07:33,840 --> 00:07:34,673
[inaudible]

134
00:07:37,260 --> 00:07:40,970
hey Kevin, I'm dopey. Dopey
in love. Oh yeah. Yeah.

135
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:45,530
Doing romantic things for her all the
time. Flowers, poems and paintings.

136
00:07:45,770 --> 00:07:49,700
Illustration of the Jackson Brown cover.
And within a year we were engaged,

137
00:07:52,860 --> 00:07:57,180
but all the while Kevin
is having seizures. Yeah.

138
00:07:57,630 --> 00:07:59,370
Since the car accident more and more,

139
00:07:59,430 --> 00:08:01,590
there was a point where
we were obviously dating,

140
00:08:02,140 --> 00:08:06,240
she helping him make his bed and um,
he said she pulled off the pillow case.

141
00:08:06,390 --> 00:08:10,020
It's covered with bloodstains
and one, two, three, four, five,

142
00:08:10,021 --> 00:08:14,520
six of you can count the
number of seizures that I
had in between my tongue and

143
00:08:14,521 --> 00:08:15,010
bled.

144
00:08:15,010 --> 00:08:16,960
I knew nothing about epilepsy.

145
00:08:17,130 --> 00:08:19,780
I had never seen anybody
have a seizure in my past.

146
00:08:19,781 --> 00:08:22,090
Those would have been big red flags
that I would have just walked away.

147
00:08:22,091 --> 00:08:23,650
But I just went with it

148
00:08:23,770 --> 00:08:28,060
and they both went with it for a few
years until finally Kevin and Jan decide

149
00:08:28,840 --> 00:08:32,770
this is enough. I wanted to be done with
it. I just needed to be done with it.

150
00:08:32,980 --> 00:08:34,450
So they schedule a brain surgery,

151
00:08:35,980 --> 00:08:36,813
uh,

152
00:08:37,320 --> 00:08:40,020
which sounds like a big
deal and obviously it is,

153
00:08:40,021 --> 00:08:43,570
but they had every reason to think
that this wouldn't change him.

154
00:08:43,640 --> 00:08:47,390
I honestly thought that he was
going to come out of it fine. Better

155
00:08:47,830 --> 00:08:49,000
cause that's what happened the first time.

156
00:08:49,270 --> 00:08:52,630
Kevin had actually gone through a brain
surgery much like this one once before

157
00:08:53,260 --> 00:08:57,150
and he'd come out pretty much the same
guy. He was still himself. In fact,

158
00:08:57,840 --> 00:09:02,140
he made sure of it. I had a, I was awake
for the surgery and that's crazy. Yeah,

159
00:09:02,200 --> 00:09:04,680
it was. I had to be awake.
I had to do with music.

160
00:09:09,770 --> 00:09:10,030
[inaudible]

161
00:09:10,030 --> 00:09:14,740
Kevin is a musician and the doctors told
him, they said that if I lost anything,

162
00:09:14,741 --> 00:09:16,810
I was going to lose my
appreciation for music,

163
00:09:17,320 --> 00:09:22,080
that it would be like music would
be white noise. I said, you know,

164
00:09:22,390 --> 00:09:25,750
no. For me music was no
is part of my personality.

165
00:09:26,410 --> 00:09:31,410
It was how I coped with my darkest
moments in dealing with epilepsy and

166
00:09:31,901 --> 00:09:35,440
seizures. At 18 years
old, I'd have a seizure,

167
00:09:35,620 --> 00:09:39,850
I take my harmonica and I'd find a place
with decent reverb somewhere and be

168
00:09:39,851 --> 00:09:42,910
right where I needed to be. I
didn't want to lose that part of me.

169
00:09:43,420 --> 00:09:46,660
So as the doctors were doing the
brain surgery, they had his head open.

170
00:09:46,720 --> 00:09:49,840
They asked him to sing. You
remember what you're saying? Um,

171
00:09:49,900 --> 00:09:51,040
and do the innocence,

172
00:09:51,550 --> 00:09:55,900
some James Taylor and while he's saying
they would tickle different parts of his

173
00:09:55,901 --> 00:10:00,400
brain and if to ever touch the part
that made him stop singing, they'd say,

174
00:10:00,401 --> 00:10:04,360
okay, that's a part we can not take
out. Wow. Yeah. And in the end,

175
00:10:04,420 --> 00:10:08,020
I think they ended up taking out like
four and a half centimeters, like a gall,

176
00:10:08,030 --> 00:10:10,900
you know, a little bit bigger than
a golf ball. Wow. But afterwards,

177
00:10:10,901 --> 00:10:11,800
as he was recovering,

178
00:10:11,801 --> 00:10:16,760
I had my keyboard in the room and I
tried playing right away, Duh, Duh,

179
00:10:16,940 --> 00:10:17,950
Duh, Duh, Duh, Duh, Duh.

180
00:10:19,430 --> 00:10:22,850
And it works. The part of him that he
really cared about was still there.

181
00:10:22,880 --> 00:10:25,700
Exactly. Yeah, it does it man. I fell
in love with after the first surgery,

182
00:10:25,701 --> 00:10:29,390
so I thought, well, you know, now that
you've got to do a second surgery,

183
00:10:29,660 --> 00:10:33,830
he's already been there on this road,
we're fine. And after that second surgery,

184
00:10:34,160 --> 00:10:37,610
he did seem fine. Janet didn't
have her brother sneak my,

185
00:10:37,670 --> 00:10:40,040
my keyboard up to the
room again. He was very,

186
00:10:40,041 --> 00:10:42,850
very adamant that he wanted the
keyboard and play it a little

187
00:10:45,170 --> 00:10:45,970
[inaudible]

188
00:10:45,970 --> 00:10:49,570
just noodled a couple of notes, played a
couple of things and it was like, okay,

189
00:10:49,571 --> 00:10:51,940
I'm there, still me. I was ready to go.

190
00:10:53,080 --> 00:10:55,900
So you go home and like
it seems to have worked.

191
00:10:56,460 --> 00:10:59,640
Yeah. As far as seizures go, we thought,
okay, this is it. We're home free.

192
00:10:59,641 --> 00:11:02,880
And uh, I was just happy to
have some normalcy. But then

193
00:11:03,160 --> 00:11:05,800
in the winter, right by
beginning the middle of January,

194
00:11:06,190 --> 00:11:10,330
Kevin noticed he wanted to eat my
physical appetite a lot more than usual.

195
00:11:10,630 --> 00:11:11,670
Like insane.

196
00:11:11,710 --> 00:11:14,140
This is a guy who didn't eat
breakfast. He had minimal lunch.

197
00:11:14,210 --> 00:11:16,720
You need having sensible dinner,
maybe a snack. That was it.

198
00:11:16,721 --> 00:11:20,620
But now I could eat the couch. It
just was odd. It was not him normally,

199
00:11:20,621 --> 00:11:21,940
but you know, you're like, okay,

200
00:11:22,360 --> 00:11:26,170
maybe it's just a side effect from
the medications. But then the piano

201
00:11:27,630 --> 00:11:28,110
[inaudible] he played

202
00:11:28,110 --> 00:11:30,990
the piano for hours. Same songs. They
used to sing in the car together.

203
00:11:31,020 --> 00:11:34,950
He has stuck on a piece. He would
play for hours. How many hours?

204
00:11:35,840 --> 00:11:40,290
Eight. Eight, nine. And then
there was sex, you know,

205
00:11:40,291 --> 00:11:44,370
we were happy, healthy couple. Kevin's
nodding. Yeah. Yeah, it was fine.

206
00:11:44,490 --> 00:11:49,470
But what was abnormal was it was, it was
anywhere. Clearly. It wasn't like, oh,

207
00:11:49,471 --> 00:11:52,110
we're in the supermarket, let's have
sex here. I mean, it wasn't like that,

208
00:11:52,111 --> 00:11:52,944
but I mean it was,

209
00:11:53,650 --> 00:11:56,250
I could just walk in the kitchen from
being out of work and he'd be like, Oh,

210
00:11:56,380 --> 00:12:01,150
let's go here. Which struck her as
weird. But then again, we were thinking,

211
00:12:01,151 --> 00:12:02,620
you know, let's try to have a family.

212
00:12:02,680 --> 00:12:06,220
So the timing made things
confusing and more than that,

213
00:12:06,250 --> 00:12:10,330
it wasn't like any of this stuff was
out of character. Exactly. In fact,

214
00:12:10,960 --> 00:12:13,900
it was all stuff that she
liked about him. Yeah.

215
00:12:13,990 --> 00:12:15,700
Except now it was all turned up to 11.

216
00:12:15,790 --> 00:12:19,000
All the things that were
wonderful became chores

217
00:12:21,640 --> 00:12:23,380
and that's pretty much
where things are at.

218
00:12:23,830 --> 00:12:26,650
When those federal agents
showed up in July of 2006,

219
00:12:26,710 --> 00:12:30,370
I was just completely blindsided. I said,
you know why we're here. I said, yeah,

220
00:12:30,371 --> 00:12:33,370
I do. I was expecting yet
Kevin took the agents upstairs.

221
00:12:33,490 --> 00:12:37,330
I took them right into here
where my computer was and
they arrested him for what

222
00:12:37,331 --> 00:12:41,400
was on that computer. I gave it up
to him right away and warning, uh,

223
00:12:41,440 --> 00:12:45,670
this next passage contained some
graphic imagery. I mean, I, I hadn't,

224
00:12:46,270 --> 00:12:47,350
I don't know if I had fully,

225
00:12:47,351 --> 00:12:52,351
like I think I had just like let child
porn be this kind of vague thing that

226
00:12:54,591 --> 00:12:58,310
meant as someone younger than 18,

227
00:12:59,120 --> 00:13:04,120
but then I read some of the court
documents and they were like toddlers.

228
00:13:04,550 --> 00:13:09,190
They were picked videos of two, three,
and four year olds. They're there.

229
00:13:09,650 --> 00:13:13,090
These sites had the most despicable,

230
00:13:13,120 --> 00:13:17,710
disgusting things you can, you
can imagine infants on throw,

231
00:13:18,670 --> 00:13:22,070
um, you know, pre preteen and you
know, pre-adolescent you know, in a,

232
00:13:22,280 --> 00:13:23,740
in adolescence. Yeah. So yeah, it,

233
00:13:24,190 --> 00:13:28,840
and you bought these things and
put them on your computer. I, yeah.

234
00:13:31,220 --> 00:13:36,210
Yeah. It, it, it bothers me.
Yeah. It bothers me. Like, uh,

235
00:13:36,750 --> 00:13:40,110
like I said, initially it was, you
know, it was just your base, your basic,

236
00:13:40,140 --> 00:13:44,010
you know, Hetero Heteros,
heterosexual playboy, like penthouse,

237
00:13:44,011 --> 00:13:45,420
like sites.

238
00:13:45,780 --> 00:13:50,780
And then windows would just start to
open up and pretty soon he says he was

239
00:13:51,111 --> 00:13:54,120
going everywhere there was gay
sex. They were, I mean, there was,

240
00:13:54,180 --> 00:13:58,320
there was bondage, there
was a dedication. Sex,

241
00:13:58,321 --> 00:14:01,470
there was animal sex, xeno sex.

242
00:14:01,620 --> 00:14:06,000
I went everywhere that a
button came up to push.

243
00:14:06,970 --> 00:14:10,830
I, I still don't understand it. I still,

244
00:14:10,831 --> 00:14:13,980
I still don't understand it. He said
it disturbed you and you feel terrible.

245
00:14:13,981 --> 00:14:17,670
But I just like wonder like, how
do you, do you tell yourself like,

246
00:14:17,671 --> 00:14:18,720
that wasn't me.

247
00:14:18,721 --> 00:14:23,630
Like how do you explain it to yourself
too so that you can kind of, I dunno,

248
00:14:23,670 --> 00:14:28,670
not feeling like you're as bad
as the person who goes there

249
00:14:30,960 --> 00:14:34,590
without a brain injury is, you know, like,

250
00:14:36,340 --> 00:14:37,710
oh Aye. Aye. Aye.

251
00:14:40,780 --> 00:14:43,270
Say that again. Ask that question. I
guess I'm just wondering, I don't know.

252
00:14:43,271 --> 00:14:46,150
Like knowing that that's a thing that
you did and it sounds like obviously you

253
00:14:46,151 --> 00:14:50,230
know that that was bad. It was a wrong
thing. And so what terrible thing. Um,

254
00:14:51,260 --> 00:14:56,090
but it was, it was you who did it or was
it not? I Dunno. You know what I mean?

255
00:14:56,540 --> 00:15:00,680
Now it, it was, it was me who
did it, but it was me with,

256
00:15:01,240 --> 00:15:01,500
hey,

257
00:15:01,500 --> 00:15:05,310
complete lack of neurological control.

258
00:15:08,760 --> 00:15:13,180
Yeah. I mean, I, I, I
know, I know who I am.

259
00:15:13,990 --> 00:15:17,500
I did idiotic things that I
couldn't stop myself from doing.

260
00:15:17,590 --> 00:15:21,070
I didn't want to do it. There would be
nights where it would be four or five,

261
00:15:21,071 --> 00:15:23,990
six hours of going to
the same site and and,

262
00:15:24,010 --> 00:15:27,490
and downloading one or two
files and then deleting them,

263
00:15:27,970 --> 00:15:31,900
going back a minute later, downloading
the same files, deleting them.

264
00:15:32,290 --> 00:15:36,480
I would download those files a dozen times
and delete them a dozen times cause I

265
00:15:36,490 --> 00:15:40,000
didn't want to be there and
knew I shouldn't be there
and couldn't help myself

266
00:15:40,001 --> 00:15:43,750
from going back. I'm not
an idiot. I mean I'm, I'm,

267
00:15:43,840 --> 00:15:46,330
I'm a smart guy. I'm not an idiot,

268
00:15:47,560 --> 00:15:49,060
but I know I had no control

269
00:15:50,090 --> 00:15:53,360
and that's what he would argue
in court. Can we plead guilty?

270
00:15:53,361 --> 00:15:56,270
But at the sentencing hearing he
asked the judge to be lenient,

271
00:15:56,510 --> 00:16:00,470
arguing essentially that the person
who did all those things in some sense

272
00:16:00,650 --> 00:16:01,483
wasn't him.

273
00:16:02,210 --> 00:16:06,500
It was some other part of his brain that
he couldn't control that the hearing,

274
00:16:06,501 --> 00:16:07,670
he called one witness,

275
00:16:07,840 --> 00:16:12,370
Orrin Devinsky. I'm a neurologist and
epilepsy specialist at NYU Medical Center.

276
00:16:12,520 --> 00:16:15,400
He's been treating Kevin for
decades, 2020 some odd years.

277
00:16:15,550 --> 00:16:18,610
And he says as soon as he found out
what Kevin had been doing had a terrible

278
00:16:18,611 --> 00:16:22,420
sense of of responsibility. This
is because of the brain surgery,

279
00:16:22,600 --> 00:16:27,010
the surgery Oren recommended he have
any argued in court that this was not

280
00:16:27,011 --> 00:16:27,844
Kevin's fault.

281
00:16:27,850 --> 00:16:32,530
I remember looking at those agents right
in their face and saying to them and to

282
00:16:32,531 --> 00:16:36,430
the judge, this could be anybody.
This could be those agents, judge,

283
00:16:36,431 --> 00:16:38,170
this could be you, this could be me,

284
00:16:38,171 --> 00:16:43,171
this could be anybody and we would
have no control over what we did it and

285
00:16:43,211 --> 00:16:45,310
explained to the court
what the biology was

286
00:16:49,390 --> 00:16:50,740
[inaudible] that the way
the brain is organized,

287
00:16:50,810 --> 00:16:54,820
that there are parts of our brain
that are way deep down that control.

288
00:16:55,180 --> 00:16:58,900
Blake base desires.
Hunger. Sex keeps US alive,

289
00:16:58,960 --> 00:17:01,270
but it's teeming with
the nastiest thoughts.

290
00:17:01,300 --> 00:17:04,030
We all have these crazy thoughts
in our head now and most of us,

291
00:17:04,031 --> 00:17:07,180
those thoughts are kept in check because
there are other parts of our brain that

292
00:17:07,181 --> 00:17:11,470
sit on top and act like a
lid. But in Kevin's case,

293
00:17:11,980 --> 00:17:16,980
the brain surgeon who did that surgery
removed part of that filter and suddenly

294
00:17:17,410 --> 00:17:18,340
the cork was off.

295
00:17:19,700 --> 00:17:23,750
I mean it was just no lid
on. His sexual desires

296
00:17:26,360 --> 00:17:27,610
is that scientist have
known about it, about

297
00:17:27,620 --> 00:17:31,400
this condition for a long time. If
her son, monkeys in rhesus monkeys,

298
00:17:31,490 --> 00:17:34,480
when the monkeys would lose roughly the
same part of the brain that Kevin lost,

299
00:17:34,510 --> 00:17:38,690
they became very hypersexual males
that would only previously be sexually

300
00:17:38,691 --> 00:17:39,890
involved with females.

301
00:17:40,130 --> 00:17:44,660
Now we're 10 times more sexually active
with both males and females that it

302
00:17:44,661 --> 00:17:46,930
feels to me, it feels
to me like there's a,

303
00:17:47,480 --> 00:17:52,320
there would be a brighter
line before kids, you know,

304
00:17:53,360 --> 00:17:57,630
I think there is a line for
quote unquote normal individuals,

305
00:17:57,990 --> 00:17:59,640
but in a brain disorder case,

306
00:17:59,641 --> 00:18:03,780
those lines get blurred and he told
the court that's what happened here.

307
00:18:03,840 --> 00:18:07,980
It was black and white. Kevin was sick
and his behavior was out of his control.

308
00:18:08,250 --> 00:18:12,900
Well, that's not what the
facts showed in this case.

309
00:18:12,990 --> 00:18:17,160
This is Lee Barton who was the prosecutor.
We saw no evidence of impulsivity.

310
00:18:17,310 --> 00:18:19,320
He says, if you're claiming
that he had no control,

311
00:18:19,321 --> 00:18:20,610
that his brain made him do it,

312
00:18:20,670 --> 00:18:23,550
then how come he had all this
child porn on his home computer?

313
00:18:23,640 --> 00:18:27,930
I believe it was 52 videos and 125 images,

314
00:18:27,960 --> 00:18:30,990
and yet on his work computer,
they were zero images,

315
00:18:31,260 --> 00:18:35,880
zero videos of child pornography on
his work computer, and he worked a lot.

316
00:18:36,180 --> 00:18:38,850
He held down a job. He
was working every day.

317
00:18:39,150 --> 00:18:41,460
If he truly lacked impulse control,

318
00:18:41,640 --> 00:18:45,390
I would think you would see child
pornography on both computers.

319
00:18:45,420 --> 00:18:50,420
And so what he argued back was what
was the lid on at work and off at home?

320
00:18:50,460 --> 00:18:52,020
Seems to me to be an easy out.

321
00:18:52,560 --> 00:18:55,860
So the answer is that this is
common with neurologic disease.

322
00:18:56,100 --> 00:19:00,480
They tend not to be 24 seven is
let's take something like Tourette's.

323
00:19:00,481 --> 00:19:03,030
Some people, when they're
engaged in playing sports,

324
00:19:03,390 --> 00:19:04,710
they tend not to have ticks,

325
00:19:04,740 --> 00:19:06,690
whereas when they're sitting
around bored or stressed,

326
00:19:06,780 --> 00:19:08,940
they do tend to have ticks.
So you could say, well,

327
00:19:09,300 --> 00:19:11,040
Therese clearly isn't a
neurological disorder,

328
00:19:11,041 --> 00:19:13,140
but note Tourette's is
a neurologic disorder.

329
00:19:13,170 --> 00:19:16,170
We understand some of the brain
things that go on Tourette's.

330
00:19:16,230 --> 00:19:19,080
The prosecution didn't buy it.
They just thought it was hogwash.

331
00:19:19,140 --> 00:19:22,290
What was hogwash was
his level of certainty,

332
00:19:25,430 --> 00:19:25,950
um,

333
00:19:25,950 --> 00:19:28,640
depressed skis and asked the Kevin
be sent to prison for five years,

334
00:19:29,460 --> 00:19:30,680
isn't paying for child porn.

335
00:19:30,740 --> 00:19:33,800
He was supporting an industry
that does terrible things to kids.

336
00:19:35,960 --> 00:19:39,230
Kevin hope t to avoid jail time
altogether and instead be placed on house

337
00:19:39,231 --> 00:19:44,180
arrest. That was per Janet
right after the arrest.

338
00:19:44,210 --> 00:19:47,660
I have to imagine that you were
in shock a little like, yeah,

339
00:19:47,990 --> 00:19:49,460
she'd gone to see a lawyer and

340
00:19:50,120 --> 00:19:50,590
[inaudible]

341
00:19:50,590 --> 00:19:53,620
one of the questions he asked was, is
this marriage going to survive this?

342
00:19:53,680 --> 00:19:55,750
And I said, I don't know.

343
00:19:58,890 --> 00:20:02,100
And at that point, understanding, I
didn't even know the level of pictures.

344
00:20:02,130 --> 00:20:02,963
Yeah.

345
00:20:03,330 --> 00:20:06,420
But she says the moment she heard orange
state that this was a brain disorder

346
00:20:06,660 --> 00:20:11,490
with the name got Kluver BC syndrome.
Once I was able to get that from me

347
00:20:12,450 --> 00:20:13,283
[inaudible]

348
00:20:13,310 --> 00:20:14,810
it clicked. Like you couldn't blame it.

349
00:20:14,840 --> 00:20:18,890
We have these experts saying that it was
a disease and I kept thinking they'll

350
00:20:18,891 --> 00:20:22,420
understand. Not to mention that after
Kevin was arrested and got an unveil or,

351
00:20:22,630 --> 00:20:26,420
and gave him some medication and Janet
says it was like flipping a switch.

352
00:20:26,600 --> 00:20:30,440
That's exactly what it was. It was
like I got him back. I was able,

353
00:20:30,560 --> 00:20:34,520
I was able to sit and watch a
movie with her, you know, normal.

354
00:20:35,300 --> 00:20:37,010
Janet actually says in a lot of ways,

355
00:20:37,011 --> 00:20:39,980
those few months between the
arrest and the sentencing hearing,

356
00:20:40,250 --> 00:20:44,240
they'd been the best months of their
marriage. He now is just so much easier,

357
00:20:44,241 --> 00:20:47,210
calmer. Uh, you could just talk,

358
00:20:47,860 --> 00:20:50,590
the hearing took about three
hours and when it was over,

359
00:20:50,591 --> 00:20:54,700
the judge took a recess, went into
her chambers. When she came back,

360
00:20:55,000 --> 00:20:56,170
she delivered her decision.

361
00:20:57,710 --> 00:20:58,110
[inaudible]

362
00:20:58,110 --> 00:21:00,210
she actually wouldn't
talk to me for the story,

363
00:21:00,211 --> 00:21:04,720
but I have the transcript
from the, uh, hearing. And um,

364
00:21:04,800 --> 00:21:08,220
if you remember the prosecutor of the
Bar, Tan was asking for five years,

365
00:21:08,310 --> 00:21:12,840
63 months or in Kevin, Janet were hoping
for house arrest, meaning no jail time.

366
00:21:12,870 --> 00:21:15,300
There's no way they're gonna put
him in jail. This is clear cut.

367
00:21:15,480 --> 00:21:18,180
And here's what the judge does.
She says, I do agree with orange.

368
00:21:18,240 --> 00:21:20,310
It is a neurological disorder,

369
00:21:20,340 --> 00:21:23,520
no question do we can't be held
fully responsible for his behavior.

370
00:21:23,640 --> 00:21:27,480
She was getting it on the other and she
said the prosecution did have a point

371
00:21:27,660 --> 00:21:32,520
that he was very much in control of his
impulses, at least some of the time.

372
00:21:32,640 --> 00:21:34,410
And so the question for the judge was,

373
00:21:34,530 --> 00:21:38,880
how does the legal system assigned blame
when a person is sometimes themselves

374
00:21:38,881 --> 00:21:43,770
and in control and sometimes
not? Well, this was a crime.

375
00:21:43,830 --> 00:21:47,310
She said a crime which ultimately
leads to children being harmed.

376
00:21:47,400 --> 00:21:50,880
And considering that you did have
moments where you were in control,

377
00:21:51,540 --> 00:21:55,890
then in those moments you
had a responsibility. You
could've done something,

378
00:21:56,310 --> 00:21:57,270
you could have asked for help,

379
00:21:57,750 --> 00:21:59,760
you could have told the people
around you what you were doing.

380
00:21:59,761 --> 00:22:03,870
So even if you couldn't have stopped
yourself, they could have stopped you.

381
00:22:05,340 --> 00:22:09,630
She made it very clear that we have
to do something here. His sentence,

382
00:22:09,780 --> 00:22:14,780
26 months at a federal prison
and 25 months of house arrest.

383
00:22:16,400 --> 00:22:20,120
And I, I believe, I believe
that she, she was, she was fair

384
00:22:21,740 --> 00:22:22,061
and I,

385
00:22:22,061 --> 00:22:27,061
I believe she was compassionate in about
a week before Christmas in 2008 Janet

386
00:22:27,611 --> 00:22:32,290
drove him to prison. How long was
he in jail for? About two years.

387
00:22:32,350 --> 00:22:35,770
And she was, even though the judge
said, you know, he is responsible.

388
00:22:35,771 --> 00:22:39,010
Does that change her headed
to, toward him at all? No,

389
00:22:39,770 --> 00:22:43,600
they totally stuck together. She
visited him pretty much every weekend.

390
00:22:43,930 --> 00:22:44,710
The whole time

391
00:22:44,710 --> 00:22:48,310
I knew the route and I had my own
little routine down in between visit,

392
00:22:48,311 --> 00:22:49,960
she'd send up notes and I'll never forget,

393
00:22:49,961 --> 00:22:53,140
he could send me mail and they had a
store where he could get some cards,

394
00:22:53,200 --> 00:22:56,050
super call murky and he
would like alter them.

395
00:22:56,290 --> 00:23:00,940
And I remember the very first card I got,
it was this very, you know, beautiful.

396
00:23:00,941 --> 00:23:03,520
Supposedly it's supposed to be
beautiful, but it was like, you know,

397
00:23:03,521 --> 00:23:07,150
if you need anything, you know
anything at all, just let me know.

398
00:23:07,151 --> 00:23:09,580
And then he writes, of
course, if it's pressing,

399
00:23:09,581 --> 00:23:13,450
you might want to ask someone else
because Oh well you can wait 24 months.

400
00:23:13,990 --> 00:23:17,320
And I remember getting that and just
laughing and then that became our thing.

401
00:23:17,321 --> 00:23:19,870
Like, listen, this is
a horrible situation,

402
00:23:20,110 --> 00:23:21,700
but we're going to make the best of it.

403
00:23:21,940 --> 00:23:25,360
Tell me a little bit about
like where things are at now.

404
00:23:25,450 --> 00:23:28,700
I think things are, are,
are almost normal. Yeah.

405
00:23:28,920 --> 00:23:33,750
Uh, you know, I, I am
still on probation. Yeah.

406
00:23:33,810 --> 00:23:37,710
But he's home. Um, he's
working. Life is going on.

407
00:23:37,711 --> 00:23:39,180
We have our normal routines.

408
00:23:39,650 --> 00:23:43,060
Kevin still takes those medicines that
keep that other part of him in check.

409
00:23:43,440 --> 00:23:48,440
I mean, I have no libido
all, but I know who I am.

410
00:23:49,820 --> 00:23:52,940
I know what I am. Um, um,

411
00:23:53,150 --> 00:23:57,290
I'm disturbed by that portion of
my life, but, um, I'm, I'm trying,

412
00:23:57,320 --> 00:23:58,310
I'm trying to move on.

413
00:24:09,120 --> 00:24:09,730
[inaudible]

414
00:24:09,730 --> 00:24:10,690
producer Pat Walters.

415
00:24:11,990 --> 00:24:15,760
Thanks also to neurologist or Devinsky
for connecting us to Kevin and Janet.

416
00:24:16,240 --> 00:24:16,751
Stay with us.

417
00:24:16,751 --> 00:24:20,650
We'll be exploring these questions if
blame and responsibility even more deeply.

418
00:24:20,680 --> 00:24:21,280
The next site.

419
00:24:21,280 --> 00:24:23,390
Don't even yell about it
a little. Yeah. Coming up.
