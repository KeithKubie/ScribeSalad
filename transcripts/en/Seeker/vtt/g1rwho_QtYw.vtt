00:00:00.099 --> 00:00:03.969
So basically we're living in the future, we’ve
got computers in our pockets, we can facetime

00:00:03.969 --> 00:00:07.830
with people across the world, and a hyperloop
train is on the way... but I want to know

00:00:07.830 --> 00:00:14.420
where the hell is my jetpack!?

00:00:14.420 --> 00:00:15.960
hey guys Julia here for DNews

00:00:15.960 --> 00:00:16.960
SOOON.

00:00:16.960 --> 00:00:17.960
It’s coming soon.

00:00:17.960 --> 00:00:19.340
By the middle or end of next year!

00:00:19.340 --> 00:00:21.330
But the company is based in New Zealand.

00:00:21.330 --> 00:00:23.830
Sooo looks like I’ll start looking at plane
tickets.

00:00:23.830 --> 00:00:27.160
The Martin jetpack is the brainchild of Glenn
Martin, which he first starting imagining

00:00:27.160 --> 00:00:28.710
way back in the early 80s.

00:00:28.710 --> 00:00:32.960
Since then it’s been through a few iterations
but this latest version runs on good old fashioned

00:00:32.960 --> 00:00:33.960
gasoline.

00:00:33.960 --> 00:00:38.120
The gasoline powers twin ducted fans that
provide the downward thrust necessary to lift

00:00:38.120 --> 00:00:39.120
a person.

00:00:39.120 --> 00:00:41.829
The frame is made from lightweight carbon
fiber and aluminum.

00:00:41.829 --> 00:00:45.519
The company’s website claims it can reach
heights of over 3,280 feet and soar around

00:00:45.519 --> 00:00:46.519
for about half an hour.

00:00:46.519 --> 00:00:50.550
And it’s only for the low low low price
of 200,000 bucks.

00:00:50.550 --> 00:00:51.859
But who would want that?

00:00:51.859 --> 00:00:53.899
Okay okay, you you probably would.

00:00:53.899 --> 00:00:56.930
Though the price might make it out of reach
for the average Joe to play around with.

00:00:56.930 --> 00:01:00.890
But it’s not just fun and games, these were
also designed with emergency responders in

00:01:00.890 --> 00:01:01.890
mind.

00:01:01.890 --> 00:01:05.489
Mike Read, director of flight operations at
Martin Aircraft Co. said, "With its small

00:01:05.489 --> 00:01:10.390
dimensions, it can operate in confined spaces,
close to and between buildings, near trees

00:01:10.390 --> 00:01:14.810
or in other areas that large or very tall
aircraft, such as helicopters, can't access."

00:01:14.810 --> 00:01:17.670
So that could be pretty cool if not slightly
expensive.

00:01:17.670 --> 00:01:21.060
So why exactly aren’t we all just zooming
around in jetpacks yet?

00:01:21.060 --> 00:01:23.700
Well when you think of a jet pack, I bet you
imagine a rocket pack.

00:01:23.700 --> 00:01:27.039
The harness that straps on your back with
two tanks that shoot massive amounts of fire

00:01:27.039 --> 00:01:28.039
out of the bottom.

00:01:28.039 --> 00:01:29.039
Right?

00:01:29.039 --> 00:01:31.759
These kind of jet packs could work by combining
fuel and an oxidizing agent.

00:01:31.759 --> 00:01:36.030
When the fuel and the oxidizing agent, maybe
hydrogen maybe liquid oxygen, mix it creates

00:01:36.030 --> 00:01:39.649
a lot of heat. and WOOSH you’d get the hot
flames shooting out the bottom to lift the

00:01:39.649 --> 00:01:40.710
person into the air.

00:01:40.710 --> 00:01:42.350
Okay, but let’s get real.

00:01:42.350 --> 00:01:43.909
They are not the greatest idea.

00:01:43.909 --> 00:01:46.810
Like WHO WANTS ROCKET FUEL BURNING BY THEIR
NETHER REGIONS!?

00:01:46.810 --> 00:01:47.820
No one.

00:01:47.820 --> 00:01:48.829
That’s who.

00:01:48.829 --> 00:01:52.829
So it’s not surprising that the Martin jetpack
uses ducted fans rather than fire to lift

00:01:52.829 --> 00:01:54.350
the rider off the ground.

00:01:54.350 --> 00:01:55.350
Another problem?

00:01:55.350 --> 00:01:56.350
The noise.

00:01:56.350 --> 00:01:58.990
The roar of the engines simply make it too
uncomfortable to use.

00:01:58.990 --> 00:02:03.450
Plus you can’t exactly sneak up on your
enemy if they can hear you from miles away.

00:02:03.450 --> 00:02:04.450
Also physics.

00:02:04.450 --> 00:02:06.560
Lift force must exceed weight force.

00:02:06.560 --> 00:02:10.140
and really the whole reason we haven’t had
jetpacks yet… is humans just aren’t made

00:02:10.140 --> 00:02:11.140
for flying.

00:02:11.140 --> 00:02:12.800
We’re awkward creatures and not very aerodynamic.

00:02:12.800 --> 00:02:16.150
To get us to fly, the pack would have to do
all the work.

00:02:16.150 --> 00:02:19.360
Which means a lot of fuel, which means the
pack is just too heavy.

00:02:19.360 --> 00:02:21.360
So you’d need a lot of fuel to lift a person.

00:02:21.360 --> 00:02:25.980
LIke the army tested a jet pack in the 50s
that was only airborne for about 13 seconds,

00:02:25.980 --> 00:02:28.300
which burned up 25 pounds of rocket fuel.

00:02:28.300 --> 00:02:33.150
To make a flight last long enough to be enjoyable,
you’d need more like 890 pounds of fuel.

00:02:33.150 --> 00:02:36.890
That doesn’t even factor in that the engine
would have to be more powerful to carry all

00:02:36.890 --> 00:02:39.080
that fuel adding more to the total weight
of the thing.

00:02:39.080 --> 00:02:40.520
It gets real problematic real fast.

00:02:40.520 --> 00:02:45.090
One of the possible versions of a jetpack
is the Bell Rocket Belt which uses hydrogen

00:02:45.090 --> 00:02:46.540
peroxide as the fuel.

00:02:46.540 --> 00:02:48.900
But there’s another big problem.

00:02:48.900 --> 00:02:50.970
Hydrogen peroxide burns fast and hot.

00:02:50.970 --> 00:02:54.370
But because it burns so fast the flight time
is only about 30 seconds.

00:02:54.370 --> 00:02:56.010
and with a hefty price tag.

00:02:56.010 --> 00:02:59.030
It can cost as much as 240 bucks a gallon.

00:02:59.030 --> 00:03:02.370
Since the flight time is so short, you really
can’t get high enough to the point where

00:03:02.370 --> 00:03:04.200
a parachute can catch your fall.

00:03:04.200 --> 00:03:05.980
So use at your own risk really.

00:03:05.980 --> 00:03:07.730
So yes, jetpacks are here.

00:03:07.730 --> 00:03:11.260
They’re nowhere near perfect, but with a
little more innovating maybe they’ll get

00:03:11.260 --> 00:03:12.260
there someday.

00:03:12.260 --> 00:03:15.790
Speaking of innovation, Intel creates the
breakthrough technologies that make amazing

00:03:15.790 --> 00:03:17.470
experiences possible.

00:03:17.470 --> 00:03:20.560
Having Intel inside makes for better experiences
outside.

00:03:20.560 --> 00:03:25.010
Intel drives innovation with products like
processors, wearables and IOT devices, and

00:03:25.010 --> 00:03:26.030
within data centers.

00:03:26.030 --> 00:03:28.010
In the PC and beyond.

00:03:28.010 --> 00:03:30.090
Got any clever ideas for an awesome jetpack?

00:03:30.090 --> 00:03:36.730
