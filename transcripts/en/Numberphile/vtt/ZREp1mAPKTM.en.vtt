00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.820
I have a pair of scissors 'cause I want to talk about a piece of maths called the Fold and Cut Theorem.

00:00:04.820 --> 00:00:07.400
It's one of those things in maths where they just name it what it is.

00:00:07.400 --> 00:00:10.260
This first came to my attention when I was trying to cut a square hole

00:00:10.260 --> 00:00:18.380
in a piece of paper. So, like, my first instinct - as a person who cuts holes in paper - was to jab a hole and then cut round the edge of the square.

00:00:18.380 --> 00:00:20.960
But I thought, ok maybe there's an easier way to do this,

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:23.880
and kind of my mathematical brain kicked in,

00:00:24.100 --> 00:00:27.520
and I realised that if I fold this in half like that,

00:00:28.040 --> 00:00:30.720
I can just cut along those three edges.

00:00:33.360 --> 00:00:36.380
Ok, I've roughly approximated the hole I was originally trying to draw.

00:00:36.380 --> 00:00:38.500
There's a square hole, and I guess

00:00:39.760 --> 00:00:44.020
like, the mathematician in me was like, "Can I do that more easily? Can I make this more efficient?"

00:00:44.420 --> 00:00:47.460
So what I thought then was, if I fold this twice,

00:00:47.460 --> 00:00:50.260
so I make the first fold the same,

00:00:51.160 --> 00:00:54.200
and then fold that at 90 degrees to that,

00:00:54.820 --> 00:00:56.420
I now have this bit of line,

00:00:56.420 --> 00:01:01.180
and I can now cut two cuts like that and,

00:01:01.900 --> 00:01:04.620
I'll end up with a square hole!

00:01:05.520 --> 00:01:08.160
Yeah, it's two cuts it's less than three cuts

00:01:08.160 --> 00:01:09.480
it's more efficient

00:01:09.640 --> 00:01:12.020
but of course you want to optimise this

00:01:12.060 --> 00:01:15.760
so your mathematically efficient way of doing this with just a square

00:01:16.020 --> 00:01:19.080
is to start off with one fold in half,

00:01:19.440 --> 00:01:22.140
a second fold like that,

00:01:22.140 --> 00:01:23.620
and then your third fold,

00:01:23.860 --> 00:01:27.080
is a diagonal fold through that corner.

00:01:27.540 --> 00:01:30.660
So as long as you get all of those kind of folds exactly right,

00:01:30.660 --> 00:01:33.540
and the lines that you're cutting along are all lying on top of each other,

00:01:33.660 --> 00:01:37.180
you can now cut out the entire square, the whole shape,

00:01:37.180 --> 00:01:39.380
with just one straight cut,

00:01:40.600 --> 00:01:41.400
like that.

00:01:41.880 --> 00:01:45.640
And this is the moment of truth, the bit where you don't really believe what you've done has worked,

00:01:45.640 --> 00:01:49.300
but it turns out a square is pretty much the easiest one to do!

00:01:49.380 --> 00:01:52.100
It is efficient and it's one straight cut

00:01:52.480 --> 00:01:57.880
And this kind of idea like I went to the pub as you do when you've discovered a nice thing,

00:01:57.880 --> 00:02:03.300
and I was like I wonder if this is a thing you can do in general, I wonder what shapes you can cut out with one cut

00:02:03.420 --> 00:02:07.060
and a friend of mine who was in the pub said isn't that a theorem?

00:02:07.920 --> 00:02:10.900
As all mathematicians will tend to do I went and looked up that

00:02:10.900 --> 00:02:17.440
It is a theorem, it's called the Fold and Cut Theorem and it says that any shape whose edges are all made up of straight lines,

00:02:17.660 --> 00:02:21.560
can be cut out with one cut, if you're prepared to fold a bit of paper.

00:02:21.740 --> 00:02:23.180
which is just insane!

00:02:23.180 --> 00:02:27.380
and I love this it was proved by a guy called Erik Demain and a team of other researchers,

00:02:27.920 --> 00:02:32.480
they've proved that it is possible to cut out any straight line edge shape,

00:02:32.480 --> 00:02:36.020
even if it's got more than one bit to it, even if it's got a hole in the middle,

00:02:36.020 --> 00:02:38.520
you can make one cut and cut out the whole thing!

00:02:38.520 --> 00:02:40.940
There are various examples of this throughout history

00:02:40.940 --> 00:02:45.140
So Harry Houdini, the magician, used to apparently do

00:02:45.140 --> 00:02:47.860
a star with one cut as part of his magic show

00:02:47.860 --> 00:02:51.020
and it is sufficiently impressive to go in a Houdini magic show, it turns out

00:02:51.020 --> 00:02:53.420
So I've looked that up and I've figured out how to do that

00:02:53.420 --> 00:02:55.420
So it's in half first,

00:02:55.860 --> 00:03:01.460
It's... in half that way and in half that way

00:03:02.140 --> 00:03:04.140
To get a cross shape

00:03:04.140 --> 00:03:07.780
And then the fold is there

00:03:08.140 --> 00:03:11.740
And in theory that should give you 108 degrees-ish

00:03:12.300 --> 00:03:14.300
You can then fold that one in half

00:03:15.580 --> 00:03:17.580
Fold that back and fold that

00:03:17.580 --> 00:03:21.580
And you can tell you've done it right 'cause that's the same size as that, ish

00:03:21.580 --> 00:03:23.820
And there's actually a nice little story behind this

00:03:23.820 --> 00:03:29.540
because apparently when America was founded in the 1770s

00:03:29.540 --> 00:03:34.100
they needed a flag and they went to see a seamstress called Betsy Ross

00:03:34.100 --> 00:03:36.900
I don't know if it's a true story, could be one of these made-up stories

00:03:36.900 --> 00:03:42.000
that George Washington walks into a fabric shop and was like "Gonna need a lot of stars cutting out"

00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:45.880
and she had a piece of fabric and she just grabbed it and folded it up like this

00:03:45.880 --> 00:03:50.960
and she did the one cut, so it's from there, kind of up that way

00:03:52.120 --> 00:03:55.600
and she unfolded this and showed George Washington

00:03:55.600 --> 00:04:00.580
that she cut out a perfect five-pointed star with just one cut

00:04:00.580 --> 00:04:05.300
and this, this story goes that he was like "oh well, you can make all the flags then."

00:04:05.300 --> 00:04:08.620
And she then had like work for life making all of the American flags

00:04:08.620 --> 00:04:11.980
and at that stage there were only like a few stars on the flag

00:04:11.980 --> 00:04:15.180
they kept updating it and adding more stars so she had to remake all the flags

00:04:15.180 --> 00:04:18.820
so it was quite a decent amount of work just 'cause she happened to know this little trick

00:04:18.820 --> 00:04:20.740
and I love that, I loved it

00:04:20.740 --> 00:04:22.740
The most, like the most impressive thing for me

00:04:22.740 --> 00:04:28.000
is that not only have you got a star, you've also got a piece of paper with a star-shaped hole in it

00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:34.080
That's a five-pointed star. That's my favorite bit, is that you get the opposite thing as well

00:04:34.080 --> 00:04:37.120
'cause it is just that line that's cut, it's nothing else

00:04:37.120 --> 00:04:40.360
The next thing in the paper that they list in, kind of, things that they've seen

00:04:40.360 --> 00:04:46.360
was that someone had once seen an example of someone who could cut out any letter of the alphabet on demand

00:04:46.360 --> 00:04:51.280
and I looked this up and tried to find it and I couldn't find anyone who did this

00:04:51.280 --> 00:04:53.600
so I was like "right, well that's... I'm gonna do that,

00:04:53.600 --> 00:04:56.120
I'm gonna figure out how to do every letter of the alphabet."

00:04:56.120 --> 00:04:59.640
And it turns out it's not even just a cool thing to be able to do

00:04:59.640 --> 00:05:01.640
it's actually a really fun thing to work out

00:05:01.880 --> 00:05:04.760
So you start with the simple letters like L

00:05:04.760 --> 00:05:07.880
'cause they're quite easy, that's just one, kind of, diagonal fold

00:05:07.880 --> 00:05:09.880
and then you need to make the ends

00:05:09.880 --> 00:05:13.400
You can do things like O as long as you don't mind it being quite square.

00:05:14.000 --> 00:05:15.960
And then things gradually get more and more difficult

00:05:15.960 --> 00:05:17.960
and the easier ones tend to be quite symmetrical.

00:05:17.960 --> 00:05:19.960
So T is quite easy.

00:05:19.960 --> 00:05:24.220
S is not easy! S is a bit of a nightmare, but it is possible.

00:05:24.220 --> 00:05:27.140
So I've worked out a fold pattern for every letter of the alphabet.

00:05:27.400 --> 00:05:30.600
Having done this, I then got an email from someone saying, "I've just found this pdf

00:05:30.600 --> 00:05:32.660
with a fold pattern for every letter of the alphabet."

00:05:32.900 --> 00:05:34.340
I was like, what!?

00:05:34.520 --> 00:05:36.460
That already existed. Oh, well, never mind.

00:05:36.460 --> 00:05:39.620
But, you know, the system that I've worked out I'm happy with.

00:05:39.620 --> 00:05:41.620
It's slightly different in places.

00:05:41.940 --> 00:05:43.940
But you know, there are these things out there,

00:05:44.000 --> 00:05:45.740
but it is more fun to work it out yourself.

00:05:47.120 --> 00:05:51.040
Well, we've got A B C D E F G H I J and K

00:05:51.420 --> 00:05:57.360
And then, L M N O P Q R S T U V W X Y and Z

00:06:01.180 --> 00:06:01.920
That's an A

00:06:03.240 --> 00:06:03.920
B

00:06:04.700 --> 00:06:05.440
That's C

00:06:09.280 --> 00:06:10.160
Here's D

00:06:10.600 --> 00:06:11.200
E

00:06:11.860 --> 00:06:12.460
F

00:06:13.080 --> 00:06:17.540
G ... that's the closest I can get to G without any curves

00:06:18.340 --> 00:06:19.000
H

00:06:20.560 --> 00:06:21.260
There's I

00:06:21.620 --> 00:06:22.180
J

00:06:23.440 --> 00:06:26.200
my initial ... K

00:06:27.540 --> 00:06:31.860
That is completely different from J ... that's L

00:06:33.000 --> 00:06:33.860
That one is M

00:06:34.940 --> 00:06:38.580
there's no way I'll get this the right way round ... N

00:06:39.220 --> 00:06:39.800
O

00:06:41.760 --> 00:06:42.900
P ... it's good enough

00:06:43.600 --> 00:06:44.960
it's tiny, but it's a Q

00:06:45.800 --> 00:06:46.740
That's R

00:06:47.000 --> 00:06:47.800
Brady: "nice!"

00:06:48.100 --> 00:06:49.240
A bit of a nightmare that one.

00:07:00.280 --> 00:07:01.580
Brady: "well done!"

00:07:01.800 --> 00:07:02.960
S

00:07:03.720 --> 00:07:04.840
Slightly funky T

00:07:06.340 --> 00:07:07.140
U

00:07:09.200 --> 00:07:10.100
Slightly '70s looking V

00:07:11.420 --> 00:07:12.280
W

00:07:13.240 --> 00:07:15.920
X ... it's quite a fun one to work out

00:07:18.660 --> 00:07:19.400
Very happy ... that's a Y

00:07:22.280 --> 00:07:26.820
It's looking good from there, isn't it? So that's Z

00:07:27.100 --> 00:07:30.140
Like, working out how to fold that is such a mathematical thing to do.

00:07:30.420 --> 00:07:35.040
Like, it's the type of thinking that mathematicians use can be applied to so many situations,

00:07:35.040 --> 00:07:36.840
and this is exactly one of them.

00:07:37.120 --> 00:07:41.580
But this is an example of something which also mathematicians have properly used, you know,

00:07:41.580 --> 00:07:44.520
mathematical analysis on, and they've proved a thing about it,

00:07:44.520 --> 00:07:47.620
which is, you know, for me, that is what maths is about.

00:07:47.620 --> 00:07:49.540
It's not about calculating things, it's about proving things.

00:07:49.540 --> 00:07:51.540
And it's about understanding how the universe works.

00:07:51.540 --> 00:07:55.100
And it turns out that in this universe, one cut suffices.

00:07:58.260 --> 00:08:01.280

Now Lynda's great. They have a huge range of video courses.

00:08:05.380 --> 00:08:12.200
I was actually going through the catalog earlier, and came across some great ones about how to use typefaces and typography.

00:08:12.220 --> 00:08:14.640
This is something I find really interesting.

00:08:14.640 --> 00:08:19.720
This one here is called The 33 Laws of Typography, and it's gone right to the top of my watch list.

00:08:19.720 --> 00:08:22.060
I'll be having a look at that one soon, I think.

00:09:00.180 --> 00:09:03.600
I did a show at Cheltenham a couple years ago, and

00:09:03.600 --> 00:09:11.720
one of the things that I did in it was, as the challenge, like, to pick a person in the audience, ask them what their name was,

00:09:11.720 --> 00:09:15.520
and then cut out that word while explaining the maths behind this.

00:09:16.220 --> 00:09:22.800
It was brilliant. I asked for a four-letter word. I said, has anyone got a four-letter name?

00:09:22.800 --> 00:09:26.000
And this guy shouted his name, and I can't remember what it was, but it was five letters.

00:09:26.000 --> 00:09:30.100
And everyone was like, mate, that's five letters. And it was just a gift, it was hilarious.
