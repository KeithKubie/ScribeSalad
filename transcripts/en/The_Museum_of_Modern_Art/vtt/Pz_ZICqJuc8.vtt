00:00:00.182 --> 00:00:03.480
(light music)

00:00:03.480 --> 00:00:05.738
Leah: I'm in the museum's
conservation studio

00:00:05.738 --> 00:00:10.138
with Piet Mondrian's "Composition
in Brown and Grey" from 1913.

00:00:10.138 --> 00:00:12.496
It was done while he was
in Paris, and in 1913

00:00:12.496 --> 00:00:14.682
he showed a group of related works

00:00:14.682 --> 00:00:16.551
in the Salond des Independant,

00:00:16.551 --> 00:00:18.414
one of the big alternative exhibitions

00:00:18.414 --> 00:00:19.902
that was held in Paris.

00:00:19.902 --> 00:00:22.143
His work was noticed
by the poet and critic,

00:00:22.143 --> 00:00:23.946
[Guillermo Poloner], who
said these were among

00:00:23.946 --> 00:00:26.805
the most celebrated
pictures in the exhibition,

00:00:26.805 --> 00:00:30.474
and called them a form
of very abstract cubism.

00:00:30.474 --> 00:00:34.314
Mondrian was preoccupied
with Picasso's work

00:00:34.314 --> 00:00:36.559
and his cubist practice
and you see references

00:00:36.559 --> 00:00:38.562
to it in his writing of this time;

00:00:38.562 --> 00:00:40.069
and he's very careful to say

00:00:40.069 --> 00:00:42.319
that he's very influenced by him,

00:00:42.319 --> 00:00:44.570
but at the same time he didn't think

00:00:44.570 --> 00:00:48.384
Picasso went far enough on
the road to abstraction.

00:00:48.384 --> 00:00:51.779
Mondrian decides that his
project is a following up

00:00:51.779 --> 00:00:54.954
the implications of what Picasso does.

00:00:54.954 --> 00:00:58.503
He begins to take the
[scaffetoling] that emerges

00:00:58.503 --> 00:01:01.442
in cubism, and to regularize it as a grid.

00:01:01.442 --> 00:01:03.876
He works from his sketchbook images

00:01:03.876 --> 00:01:06.610
of the motif of trees, and the branches

00:01:06.610 --> 00:01:09.296
of the trees are systematized here

00:01:09.296 --> 00:01:11.428
along here the horizontal
and vertical axis;

00:01:11.428 --> 00:01:14.539
they even begin to look
a bit like architecture.

00:01:14.539 --> 00:01:17.070
The horizontal and vertical become

00:01:17.070 --> 00:01:18.741
the common vocabulary,

00:01:18.741 --> 00:01:21.251
hen you see a whole
variety of brush strokes.

00:01:21.251 --> 00:01:23.109
He's exploring the relationship

00:01:23.109 --> 00:01:25.714
between center and peripheral,

00:01:25.714 --> 00:01:27.672
and this is a real problem for this

00:01:27.672 --> 00:01:30.315
pioneering generation of abstract artists;

00:01:30.315 --> 00:01:32.355
once objects are no longer

00:01:32.355 --> 00:01:34.139
the primary thing in a work of art,

00:01:34.139 --> 00:01:37.124
how do you figure out
how to end a picture?

00:01:37.124 --> 00:01:38.761
How do you decide what's foreground?

00:01:38.761 --> 00:01:40.192
How do you decide what's background?

00:01:40.192 --> 00:01:42.164
Here he is working very much

00:01:42.164 --> 00:01:43.539
on the edges of the picture

00:01:43.539 --> 00:01:45.890
to suggest what happens when you move

00:01:45.890 --> 00:01:49.583
away from the structuring composition.

00:01:49.583 --> 00:01:52.823
Piet Mondrian sent this
picture from Paris,

00:01:52.823 --> 00:01:55.667
and a group of others,
back to the Netherlands

00:01:55.667 --> 00:01:58.521
for his first one-man exhibition,

00:01:58.521 --> 00:02:01.721
and then he traveled to The
Hague a few weeks later,

00:02:01.721 --> 00:02:03.973
but by that time World
War I had broken out

00:02:03.973 --> 00:02:06.537
and he was unable to return to Paris.

00:02:06.537 --> 00:02:11.925
