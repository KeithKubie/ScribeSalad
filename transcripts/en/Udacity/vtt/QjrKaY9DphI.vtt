00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.000
And let's go through each of the options.

00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:04.000
This first option will not work.

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:06.000
Since ta_data is a tuple

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:11.000
containing 3 elements, we need to reference each of those 3 elements

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:13.000
for Python to understand what we want.

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:15.000
Here we only reference name, country;

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:18.000
we don't even reference course at all,

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:21.000
so Python gets confused and if you try to run this you will get an error.

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:24.000
The second option looks great.

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:26.000
It's readable; name, plus lives in country

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:28.000
is very easy to understand.

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:31.000
It references all 3 variables in ta_data.

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:35.000
Looks like I forgot my closed brackets here.

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:38.000
This third option will also work.

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:40.000
It has 2 variable names,

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:44.000
and we reference all 3 elements in the tuple,

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:46.000
but I don't like this one as much as the second one.

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:49.000
The reason being "x lives in y"

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:53.000
doesn't remind me that I'm talking about a name and a country.

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:55.000
As far as readability is concerned,

00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:57.000
I prefer option 2.

00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:00.000
And, you can see, if we try to run option 1,

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:04.000
we get an error message--value error--

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:06.000
too many values to unpack.

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:08.000
If we run option 2 or 3 however,

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:10.000
we get exactly what we want.
