[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:00:04.760 --> 00:00:06.260
CHARITY WORRELL:
Alex Guarnaschelli.

00:00:06.260 --> 00:00:06.770
Welcome.

00:00:06.770 --> 00:00:09.150
[APPLAUSE]

00:00:11.530 --> 00:00:12.990
ALEX GUARNASCHELLI: How are you?

00:00:12.990 --> 00:00:13.405
CHARITY WORRELL: Hi.

00:00:13.405 --> 00:00:13.820
ALEX GUARNASCHELLI: Is this OK?

00:00:13.820 --> 00:00:14.610
CHARITY WORRELL: You
can sit here, yeah.

00:00:14.610 --> 00:00:16.693
ALEX GUARNASCHELLI: OK,
this isn't nerve wracking.

00:00:16.693 --> 00:00:17.320
[LAUGH]

00:00:17.320 --> 00:00:19.050
I've done this once before.

00:00:19.050 --> 00:00:20.760
CHARITY WORRELL: You came five
years ago for your first book.

00:00:20.760 --> 00:00:20.810
ALEX GUARNASCHELLI: Yeah.

00:00:20.810 --> 00:00:21.980
I was super-cranky.

00:00:21.980 --> 00:00:23.192
I'm a Gemini.

00:00:23.192 --> 00:00:24.430
[LAUGH]

00:00:24.430 --> 00:00:27.820
About half of me was, like,
on the porch drinking beer.

00:00:27.820 --> 00:00:32.200
And I came here, and people were
like, hmm, most un-googled talk

00:00:32.200 --> 00:00:33.885
this is going to be.

00:00:33.885 --> 00:00:35.260
CHARITY WORRELL:
Um, so what made

00:00:35.260 --> 00:00:37.802
you ready to decide to
write another cookbook?

00:00:37.802 --> 00:00:40.900
ALEX GUARNASCHELLI: Um,
compulsive behavior.

00:00:40.900 --> 00:00:41.570
[LAUGH]

00:00:41.570 --> 00:00:42.660
No, I'm kidding.

00:00:42.660 --> 00:00:44.340
I'm actually not.

00:00:44.340 --> 00:00:45.790
I'm an insomniac.

00:00:45.790 --> 00:00:47.490
And I am-- thank you.

00:00:47.490 --> 00:00:48.820
All right.

00:00:48.820 --> 00:00:51.850
Mom, is that you?

00:00:51.850 --> 00:00:54.250
I'm an insomniac.

00:00:54.250 --> 00:00:56.080
I cook a lot.

00:00:56.080 --> 00:00:59.050
I cook a lot at home because
I have an 11-year-old child.

00:00:59.050 --> 00:01:00.940
CHARITY WORRELL: Ava,
who's here today.

00:01:00.940 --> 00:01:02.460
ALEX GUARNASCHELLI: Yes.

00:01:02.460 --> 00:01:05.019
She's forced to be here.

00:01:05.019 --> 00:01:06.760
She looks so gracious
and hospitable.

00:01:06.760 --> 00:01:09.630
But really, it's all a lie.

00:01:09.630 --> 00:01:10.510
So I'm an insomniac.

00:01:10.510 --> 00:01:11.330
I love to cook.

00:01:11.330 --> 00:01:12.310
I cook a lot at home.

00:01:12.310 --> 00:01:16.390
And I think that books
for chefs, that are chefy,

00:01:16.390 --> 00:01:18.880
where you're tweezing
caviar on tiny,

00:01:18.880 --> 00:01:21.640
little pieces of microcelery,
that are then suspended

00:01:21.640 --> 00:01:24.910
in mid-air, and they're
from Switzerland--

00:01:24.910 --> 00:01:26.710
that stuff is really daunting.

00:01:26.710 --> 00:01:29.890
And I find that a lot more of
the cooking that I actually do

00:01:29.890 --> 00:01:32.090
is at home.

00:01:32.090 --> 00:01:36.290
And so I just apply a chef
sensibility to home cooking.

00:01:36.290 --> 00:01:40.390
And so I found there was just
a big body of recipes I had,

00:01:40.390 --> 00:01:42.470
that really spoke
to me in that way.

00:01:42.470 --> 00:01:44.660
And that's really how
this book came about.

00:01:44.660 --> 00:01:44.890
CHARITY WORRELL: Yeah.

00:01:44.890 --> 00:01:47.050
Because it's been five
years in between, right?

00:01:47.050 --> 00:01:48.650
Because you came
here five years ago.

00:01:48.650 --> 00:01:49.832
ALEX GUARNASCHELLI: Yes.

00:01:49.832 --> 00:01:51.165
A reminder of my unproductivity.

00:01:51.165 --> 00:01:52.077
[LAUGHTER]

00:01:52.077 --> 00:01:52.910
CHARITY WORRELL: No.

00:01:52.910 --> 00:01:53.680
ALEX GUARNASCHELLI:
And I'm teasing.

00:01:53.680 --> 00:01:55.330
CHARITY WORRELL: The
book is so full, like--

00:01:55.330 --> 00:01:55.720
ALEX GUARNASCHELLI: Yeah.

00:01:55.720 --> 00:01:57.594
CHARITY WORRELL: There's
so much depth in it.

00:01:57.594 --> 00:02:00.310
And there's so many-- so many
recipes that are not daunting

00:02:00.310 --> 00:02:02.650
for someone who is not a
culinary trained person,

00:02:02.650 --> 00:02:03.430
like myself--

00:02:03.430 --> 00:02:04.513
ALEX GUARNASCHELLI: Right.

00:02:04.513 --> 00:02:05.840
CHARITY WORRELL: --to tackle.

00:02:05.840 --> 00:02:07.390
ALEX GUARNASCHELLI: I just
think how much-- you know,

00:02:07.390 --> 00:02:09.220
there's so many cookbooks
in the universe.

00:02:09.220 --> 00:02:11.320
I am the daughter of
a cookbook editor.

00:02:11.320 --> 00:02:13.870
My mother is basically
the Quincy Jones

00:02:13.870 --> 00:02:15.430
of cookbook editing.

00:02:15.430 --> 00:02:19.540
And she-- I just said kind of
said, how many more cookbooks

00:02:19.540 --> 00:02:21.250
can we put out in the world?

00:02:21.250 --> 00:02:24.130
And I went to Martha
Stewart's last book party.

00:02:24.130 --> 00:02:27.700
And I said, wow, a book
about flowers, Martha.

00:02:27.700 --> 00:02:28.870
What book is this for you?

00:02:28.870 --> 00:02:31.360
And she said, it's my 99th book.

00:02:31.360 --> 00:02:32.830
CHARITY WORRELL: Wow.

00:02:32.830 --> 00:02:36.710
ALEX GUARNASCHELLI: And I just
said, I'm on like 0.99th book.

00:02:36.710 --> 00:02:38.541
So apparently there's
a lot more to say.

00:02:38.541 --> 00:02:40.540
CHARITY WORRELL: How did
you choose the recipes?

00:02:43.099 --> 00:02:44.890
ALEX GUARNASCHELLI:
That's a good question.

00:02:44.890 --> 00:02:48.520
You know, just collections.

00:02:48.520 --> 00:02:51.880
Every kitchen I worked in, I
just took notes on a notepad.

00:02:51.880 --> 00:02:54.850
And they're all, like, small,
to fit in the back pocket

00:02:54.850 --> 00:02:56.010
or in the bra.

00:02:56.010 --> 00:02:57.760
So you can write
something down and just--

00:02:57.760 --> 00:03:00.631
no, chef, I didn't
write that down.

00:03:00.631 --> 00:03:03.460
[LAUGHTER]

00:03:03.460 --> 00:03:05.880
And they're just greasy
and butter-stained.

00:03:05.880 --> 00:03:09.490
And they have like
raspberry jam on them.

00:03:09.490 --> 00:03:11.920
But I just collected
all these recipes.

00:03:11.920 --> 00:03:16.060
And I sort of find
that the recipes pop up

00:03:16.060 --> 00:03:20.960
in their proper order
as the book unfolds.

00:03:20.960 --> 00:03:23.500
So really, I write--

00:03:23.500 --> 00:03:25.930
I wrote the book late at night
and early in the morning.

00:03:25.930 --> 00:03:26.950
Everybody is sleeping.

00:03:26.950 --> 00:03:28.660
And I'm like, oh, yeah.

00:03:28.660 --> 00:03:30.552
I'm deep in a
raspberry donut recipe.

00:03:30.552 --> 00:03:32.010
And my daughter is
like, what's up?

00:03:32.010 --> 00:03:34.030
And I'm like, I can't talk.

00:03:34.030 --> 00:03:35.110
The yeast is wrong.

00:03:35.110 --> 00:03:36.610
CHARITY WORRELL: I
remember the talk

00:03:36.610 --> 00:03:38.734
you did five years ago
because I was here for that.

00:03:38.734 --> 00:03:41.320
You mentioned that your
mom did the similar--

00:03:41.320 --> 00:03:43.462
was similar in the way
she edited the cookbooks.

00:03:43.462 --> 00:03:44.170
You would get up.

00:03:44.170 --> 00:03:46.570
And she would still be
editing from the night before.

00:03:46.570 --> 00:03:49.160
ALEX GUARNASCHELLI: So twisted,
my mother, so very twisted.

00:03:49.160 --> 00:03:49.660
Yeah.

00:03:49.660 --> 00:03:53.620
My mother did the 1997 revision
of "The Joy of Cooking."

00:03:53.620 --> 00:03:57.400
So every 10 years or so, "The
Joy of Cooking" is revised.

00:03:57.400 --> 00:03:58.060
Why?

00:03:58.060 --> 00:03:59.860
Why revise a book like this?

00:03:59.860 --> 00:04:01.990
Well, I mean when you have
turtle soup and squirrel

00:04:01.990 --> 00:04:04.780
brain in a recipe, in a
book, you don't kind of

00:04:04.780 --> 00:04:06.760
realize tastes evolve.

00:04:09.310 --> 00:04:12.130
We now have an Instagram of a
double-decker turkey/squirrel

00:04:12.130 --> 00:04:13.180
sandwich.

00:04:13.180 --> 00:04:16.899
I mean, I'm kidding,
but maybe not.

00:04:16.899 --> 00:04:18.610
So my mother was
revising this book.

00:04:18.610 --> 00:04:19.660
And it took--

00:04:19.660 --> 00:04:21.850
I mean, it took almost
four years of her life.

00:04:21.850 --> 00:04:25.990
And I was working at
Restaurant DANIEL at the time.

00:04:25.990 --> 00:04:27.865
And I started my
shift at 4 o'clock

00:04:27.865 --> 00:04:30.010
in the morning, the lunch shift.

00:04:30.010 --> 00:04:32.710
I would start prepping
lunch food at 4:30.

00:04:32.710 --> 00:04:34.611
And sometimes not be
set up, by the way.

00:04:34.611 --> 00:04:36.610
Just like someone would
order something at noon,

00:04:36.610 --> 00:04:39.850
and I'd like, hmm, hope
to have that by the time

00:04:39.850 --> 00:04:43.120
they get back from the
bathroom or their phone call.

00:04:43.120 --> 00:04:45.281
So my mom and I were
on the same schedule.

00:04:45.281 --> 00:04:46.780
I mean, I would get
up and she would

00:04:46.780 --> 00:04:51.172
be bent over a stack of papers
at the dining room table.

00:04:51.172 --> 00:04:52.630
And I would say,
I'm going to work.

00:04:52.630 --> 00:04:55.400
And she would just hold
up a picture and say,

00:04:55.400 --> 00:04:57.724
does this look like
a Malpeque oyster?

00:04:57.724 --> 00:04:59.890
And I'm like, no, you know,
a Malpeque is a little--

00:04:59.890 --> 00:05:00.723
she's like, shut up.

00:05:00.723 --> 00:05:02.260
It's a Malpeque.

00:05:02.260 --> 00:05:03.762
So she was asking,
but she wasn't.

00:05:03.762 --> 00:05:04.720
So I learned, you know.

00:05:04.720 --> 00:05:06.820
Does this look like
a Belgian waffle?

00:05:06.820 --> 00:05:08.590
I'm like, it's a nice waffle.

00:05:08.590 --> 00:05:11.082
She's like, does
it look Belgian?

00:05:11.082 --> 00:05:13.340
So things got a little intense.

00:05:13.340 --> 00:05:16.936
Sleep deprivation, and lack of
food, and oxygen, and water,

00:05:16.936 --> 00:05:18.560
while you're writing
a book about food,

00:05:18.560 --> 00:05:22.352
and oxygen, and water
can get a little ironic.

00:05:22.352 --> 00:05:23.810
CHARITY WORRELL:
How did you choose

00:05:23.810 --> 00:05:25.060
how to break up the chapters?

00:05:25.060 --> 00:05:26.630
Like, I saw that--

00:05:26.630 --> 00:05:28.970
I was very curious
to ask you this.

00:05:28.970 --> 00:05:32.185
Root vegetables and the onion
family got their own chapters.

00:05:32.185 --> 00:05:33.560
ALEX GUARNASCHELLI:
You know, I'm

00:05:33.560 --> 00:05:37.880
so sick of the non-sexy
veg hanging out

00:05:37.880 --> 00:05:40.700
underneath-- in the dark
bins-- in the nosebleeds

00:05:40.700 --> 00:05:42.020
of the supermarket.

00:05:42.020 --> 00:05:47.780
Like asparagus, and fava beans,
and fresh peas, and pineapple,

00:05:47.780 --> 00:05:50.480
right, they're all the ones
that have all this external sex

00:05:50.480 --> 00:05:51.900
appeal.

00:05:51.900 --> 00:05:54.230
What about the unsung heroes?

00:05:54.230 --> 00:05:57.080
What about the kind of
bless-your-heart homely

00:05:57.080 --> 00:06:00.097
vegetables that really deliver?

00:06:00.097 --> 00:06:02.180
CHARITY WORRELL: You did
a lot of with the potato.

00:06:02.180 --> 00:06:05.300
ALEX GUARNASCHELLI: I went at
the bins underneath, rutabaga,

00:06:05.300 --> 00:06:07.400
celery root, even mushrooms.

00:06:07.400 --> 00:06:09.140
I mean, I feel like
they're always there.

00:06:09.140 --> 00:06:10.390
And you're like, oh, whatever.

00:06:10.390 --> 00:06:11.230
I'll buy mushrooms.

00:06:11.230 --> 00:06:12.460
CHARITY WORRELL:
Unless it's a truffle.

00:06:12.460 --> 00:06:12.830
ALEX GUARNASCHELLI: Right.

00:06:12.830 --> 00:06:13.520
CHARITY WORRELL:
Unless it's a truffle.

00:06:13.520 --> 00:06:14.600
ALEX GUARNASCHELLI: Right.

00:06:14.600 --> 00:06:15.099
OK.

00:06:15.099 --> 00:06:17.410
But they're not
native to America.

00:06:17.410 --> 00:06:19.220
And there are no truffles here.

00:06:19.220 --> 00:06:20.870
So I tried also to stick with--

00:06:20.870 --> 00:06:22.250
I love the supermarket.

00:06:22.250 --> 00:06:24.950
I mean for me, it's
like a wonderland.

00:06:24.950 --> 00:06:26.780
I can't-- I go to
the supermarket,

00:06:26.780 --> 00:06:28.160
I'm there for two hours.

00:06:28.160 --> 00:06:29.810
Just like, oh, look at this.

00:06:29.810 --> 00:06:30.690
It's really sick.

00:06:30.690 --> 00:06:32.640
I need counseling.

00:06:32.640 --> 00:06:33.140
I do.

00:06:33.140 --> 00:06:36.200
I need-- like, if I go to a
farm stand and a supermarket,

00:06:36.200 --> 00:06:37.400
that's the day for me.

00:06:37.400 --> 00:06:39.560
It's over.

00:06:39.560 --> 00:06:41.150
So all those mushrooms that--

00:06:41.150 --> 00:06:44.920
the supermarket mushrooms
that are always there,

00:06:44.920 --> 00:06:47.430
like shiitakes,
criminis, portobellos.

00:06:47.430 --> 00:06:47.930
White.

00:06:47.930 --> 00:06:49.050
But there's so much stuff.

00:06:49.050 --> 00:06:52.310
So again, there's a
supermarket mushroom chapter.

00:06:52.310 --> 00:06:54.290
I hate those recipes,
too, that are like,

00:06:54.290 --> 00:06:57.980
take three pounds of porcini
mushrooms, fresh from Oregon.

00:06:57.980 --> 00:07:00.410
I'm like, I don't have that.

00:07:00.410 --> 00:07:03.470
How do you feel about some
shiitakes from a parking lot

00:07:03.470 --> 00:07:04.100
in New Jersey?

00:07:04.100 --> 00:07:07.200
Will that-- can I sub that in?

00:07:07.200 --> 00:07:09.384
So if I'm thinking that,
aren't a lot of people?

00:07:09.384 --> 00:07:10.300
CHARITY WORRELL: Yeah.

00:07:10.300 --> 00:07:10.820
ALEX GUARNASCHELLI: Yeah.

00:07:10.820 --> 00:07:12.612
CHARITY WORRELL: We're
not all Eric Ripert.

00:07:12.612 --> 00:07:14.736
ALEX GUARNASCHELLI: No one
actually is Eric Ripert.

00:07:14.736 --> 00:07:15.800
CHARITY WORRELL: Yeah.

00:07:15.800 --> 00:07:18.690
ALEX GUARNASCHELLI: I actually
think he's an imposter himself.

00:07:18.690 --> 00:07:21.080
He's just a perfect human being.

00:07:21.080 --> 00:07:22.021
It's really upsetting.

00:07:22.021 --> 00:07:22.520
Yeah.

00:07:22.520 --> 00:07:23.150
He's married.

00:07:23.150 --> 00:07:24.620
Let's move on.

00:07:24.620 --> 00:07:27.410
[LAUGHTER]

00:07:27.410 --> 00:07:28.980
CHARITY WORRELL:
So obviously you

00:07:28.980 --> 00:07:30.500
cook from your own cookbook.

00:07:30.500 --> 00:07:34.229
What's your go-to-recipes
for the week?

00:07:34.229 --> 00:07:36.770
ALEX GUARNASCHELLI: You know,
I give lots of recommendations.

00:07:36.770 --> 00:07:39.860
But as a chef, I approach
a cookbook-- cooking

00:07:39.860 --> 00:07:42.110
from a cookbook-- in a
very disorganized fashion.

00:07:42.110 --> 00:07:43.970
I think a lot of chefs do this.

00:07:43.970 --> 00:07:45.480
I'll take a cookbook.

00:07:45.480 --> 00:07:48.080
And I'll look at a pork
chop and apple recipe.

00:07:48.080 --> 00:07:50.400
And I will turn it into--

00:07:50.400 --> 00:07:52.470
I'll make it multiple times.

00:07:52.470 --> 00:07:55.700
And then the recipe will
give me an idea for a pie.

00:07:55.700 --> 00:07:58.340
And the pork chop
recipe then morphs

00:07:58.340 --> 00:08:01.760
into a great pie filling, that
started with something else.

00:08:01.760 --> 00:08:04.630
So for this--

00:08:04.630 --> 00:08:06.622
I really liked
the pasta recipes.

00:08:06.622 --> 00:08:08.330
And I like them because
you can make them

00:08:08.330 --> 00:08:10.287
and when they sit overnight--

00:08:10.287 --> 00:08:11.870
after you're done
eating a bunch of it

00:08:11.870 --> 00:08:15.380
in the door of the
fridge really late--

00:08:15.380 --> 00:08:17.660
I know you're not
here the whole time.

00:08:17.660 --> 00:08:19.160
I know you got stuff
in your fridge.

00:08:19.160 --> 00:08:21.140
Everybody does it, the
old door of the fridge,

00:08:21.140 --> 00:08:23.060
in your underwear
type of eating.

00:08:23.060 --> 00:08:24.260
That is so delicious.

00:08:24.260 --> 00:08:27.120
Let's be honest.

00:08:27.120 --> 00:08:29.395
So I like those types of
recipes for the snack.

00:08:29.395 --> 00:08:30.770
And then maybe
the next day, they

00:08:30.770 --> 00:08:33.590
taste even better-- anything
tomato based, for example.

00:08:33.590 --> 00:08:37.340
Tomatoes love to be cooked and
then left to sit overnight,

00:08:37.340 --> 00:08:38.419
or even two days.

00:08:38.419 --> 00:08:39.900
I find they're better.

00:08:39.900 --> 00:08:41.750
I have a lot of one-pot meals.

00:08:41.750 --> 00:08:42.710
Those are great, too.

00:08:42.710 --> 00:08:46.065
And people love that.

00:08:46.065 --> 00:08:49.120
People aren't going to spend
as much time as I do cooking.

00:08:49.120 --> 00:08:52.280
And I assume not obsessively
seeing food everywhere

00:08:52.280 --> 00:08:53.690
they look in the universe.

00:08:53.690 --> 00:08:55.807
I mean literally, I went
to a store yesterday.

00:08:55.807 --> 00:08:57.140
And I was looking at surfboards.

00:08:57.140 --> 00:09:00.110
And I'm like, tsk, an
ice cream sandwich,

00:09:00.110 --> 00:09:03.110
shaped like a surfboard,
with a flared edge.

00:09:03.110 --> 00:09:04.430
I'm all in with--

00:09:04.430 --> 00:09:07.520
I'm thinking flavor combos
of cookies and ice cream.

00:09:07.520 --> 00:09:10.100
And then I realized
that I just look creepy.

00:09:12.650 --> 00:09:15.260
And that some people go to the
store and just see a surfboard.

00:09:15.260 --> 00:09:19.730
So probably a lot of those types
of recipes that are make-ahead

00:09:19.730 --> 00:09:21.320
or that can sit in the fridge.

00:09:21.320 --> 00:09:24.230
Also, there's a whole chapter
of sauces and vinaigrettes.

00:09:24.230 --> 00:09:24.460
CHARITY WORRELL: Yeah.

00:09:24.460 --> 00:09:25.040
I saw that.

00:09:25.040 --> 00:09:27.123
CHARITY WORRELL: So you
can make a bunch of those,

00:09:27.123 --> 00:09:29.100
throw in what I call
the door of the fridge.

00:09:29.100 --> 00:09:32.090
And then you buy
something, chicken, steak,

00:09:32.090 --> 00:09:34.910
whatever you're feeling,
tofu, vegetables.

00:09:34.910 --> 00:09:36.770
And you throw one of
those sauces on it.

00:09:36.770 --> 00:09:38.250
And then you feel fancy.

00:09:38.250 --> 00:09:41.000
And then you tell people you
made the whole meal yourself.

00:09:41.000 --> 00:09:43.225
Or just buy something
to go and just

00:09:43.225 --> 00:09:45.100
dump one of your homemade
vinaigrettes on it,

00:09:45.100 --> 00:09:46.701
and be like, I crushed it.

00:09:46.701 --> 00:09:50.760
[LAUGHTER]

00:09:50.760 --> 00:09:53.640
CHARITY WORRELL: What chefs have
inspired you over the years?

00:09:53.640 --> 00:09:55.348
ALEX GUARNASCHELLI:
I love this question.

00:09:57.220 --> 00:09:59.830
So many.

00:09:59.830 --> 00:10:01.660
Chefs I envy.

00:10:01.660 --> 00:10:04.060
Chefs I want to be,
that I won't be.

00:10:04.060 --> 00:10:05.932
Chefs, I'm so mad at
being, that aren't me.

00:10:05.932 --> 00:10:07.390
There's a lot of
envy and jealousy.

00:10:07.390 --> 00:10:09.910
Are you getting a theme?

00:10:09.910 --> 00:10:12.880
And then chefs I just love
to-- some I love to talk,

00:10:12.880 --> 00:10:15.760
some I love to watch cook.

00:10:15.760 --> 00:10:17.950
I like Anne-Sophie Pic a lot.

00:10:17.950 --> 00:10:18.820
She's French.

00:10:18.820 --> 00:10:20.830
She's got a three-star Michelin.

00:10:20.830 --> 00:10:23.160
And she just stands
there like this, calmly,

00:10:23.160 --> 00:10:27.180
with like 700 people
behind her, all like--

00:10:27.180 --> 00:10:28.994
and I covet that
kind of relationship.

00:10:28.994 --> 00:10:30.910
I go to my own restaurant
to, like, what's up?

00:10:30.910 --> 00:10:31.030
What's up?

00:10:31.030 --> 00:10:31.850
How you doing?

00:10:31.850 --> 00:10:33.479
There's, like, rap
music blasting.

00:10:33.479 --> 00:10:35.770
And they throw me, like, a
pint container of ice water.

00:10:35.770 --> 00:10:38.050
And I'm like, hmm, almost.

00:10:38.050 --> 00:10:39.850
[LAUGHTER]

00:10:39.850 --> 00:10:44.020
It's all a matter how you
frame the picture, people.

00:10:44.020 --> 00:10:46.465
I like-- chefs I've
worked for or with--

00:10:46.465 --> 00:10:49.450
Guy Savoy, who has a restaurant
in Las Vegas and in Paris.

00:10:49.450 --> 00:10:52.360
I worked for him for
almost seven years.

00:10:52.360 --> 00:10:54.160
And I hear his voice in my head.

00:10:54.160 --> 00:10:57.486
I think everyone has a mentor,
or a boss, or a colleague.

00:10:57.486 --> 00:10:58.360
And that's the voice.

00:10:58.360 --> 00:11:02.010
Or your mother, if you've not
worked it out on the couch.

00:11:02.010 --> 00:11:04.270
That's where it stays
for a little while.

00:11:04.270 --> 00:11:06.890
I hear his voice in my
head when I'm cooking.

00:11:06.890 --> 00:11:09.340
And he just-- the one thing
he always taught me was

00:11:09.340 --> 00:11:11.320
do not ever throw flavor away.

00:11:11.320 --> 00:11:13.450
If you're cooking
something in a pan,

00:11:13.450 --> 00:11:17.100
get the juices from where that
fish, or meat, or whatever

00:11:17.100 --> 00:11:17.820
cooked--

00:11:17.820 --> 00:11:21.240
and get that into the dish,
and not for the dishwasher.

00:11:21.240 --> 00:11:23.040
And so every time
I'm cooking, I always

00:11:23.040 --> 00:11:26.590
think how can I keep all
the flavor in the room?

00:11:26.590 --> 00:11:28.810
And so that constant reminder.

00:11:28.810 --> 00:11:31.099
Because that's true every
time you cook something,

00:11:31.099 --> 00:11:32.640
whether it's a slice
of toast, you're

00:11:32.640 --> 00:11:34.800
like, collect the crumbs,
collect the good bits.

00:11:34.800 --> 00:11:38.090
Everything has-- you know,
don't leave anything behind.

00:11:38.090 --> 00:11:41.260
And so he's a big one for me.

00:11:41.260 --> 00:11:43.420
CHARITY WORRELL:
So shifting a bit,

00:11:43.420 --> 00:11:45.235
how did you end up
on the Food Network?

00:11:45.235 --> 00:11:46.360
ALEX GUARNASCHELLI: I know.

00:11:46.360 --> 00:11:46.919
I don't know.

00:11:46.919 --> 00:11:47.710
I don't-- I don't--

00:11:47.710 --> 00:11:48.970
I can't believe it, right.

00:11:48.970 --> 00:11:49.750
So crazy.

00:11:49.750 --> 00:11:50.960
CHARITY WORRELL:
You're an Iron Chef.

00:11:50.960 --> 00:11:52.335
ALEX GUARNASCHELLI:
Yeah, I know.

00:11:53.174 --> 00:11:54.590
CHARITY WORRELL:
Do you know that?

00:11:54.590 --> 00:11:56.215
ALEX GUARNASCHELLI:
Oh, I so know that.

00:11:56.215 --> 00:11:57.400
Are you crazy town?

00:11:57.400 --> 00:11:59.830
I get up every day, I'm like
my life is a complete sham,

00:11:59.830 --> 00:12:02.977
but I am an Iron Chef.

00:12:02.977 --> 00:12:04.810
CHARITY WORRELL: Well,
what is that feeling?

00:12:04.810 --> 00:12:05.520
ALEX GUARNASCHELLI: Oh, my god.

00:12:05.520 --> 00:12:07.540
That-- and imagine
it's on television.

00:12:07.540 --> 00:12:09.430
I can watch one of the great--

00:12:09.430 --> 00:12:13.120
I mean, giving birth to my
child was definitely the best,

00:12:13.120 --> 00:12:16.030
but I don't want to
watch that video.

00:12:16.030 --> 00:12:17.230
Not my sexiest.

00:12:17.230 --> 00:12:22.600
But to watch getting
that title, I can--

00:12:22.600 --> 00:12:25.062
my daughter has it
saved in the DVR.

00:12:25.062 --> 00:12:26.770
And I'll come home
every once in a while,

00:12:26.770 --> 00:12:28.820
and she's like, check this out.

00:12:28.820 --> 00:12:32.080
And I'm like, oh,
this old thing.

00:12:32.080 --> 00:12:34.450
This old reel of me?

00:12:34.450 --> 00:12:36.809
So great, because
a lot of chefs--

00:12:36.809 --> 00:12:39.100
I don't know, maybe a lot of
people but a lot of chefs,

00:12:39.100 --> 00:12:42.610
I think, are a hybrid
of acute arrogance

00:12:42.610 --> 00:12:45.050
and low self-esteem
and no middle.

00:12:45.050 --> 00:12:47.860
So we're like a really
great donut with no filling.

00:12:47.860 --> 00:12:50.920
And so when you have a moment
that's actual validation

00:12:50.920 --> 00:12:56.470
that you can witness,
it mixes that salad up,

00:12:56.470 --> 00:12:57.820
and for me, it did.

00:12:57.820 --> 00:13:03.130
And so I won, and all I was
thinking was oh, don't cry.

00:13:03.130 --> 00:13:06.130
Like, please don't cry, inside.

00:13:06.130 --> 00:13:08.260
Like don't get all,
like, you like me.

00:13:08.260 --> 00:13:09.790
You really like--
no, none of that.

00:13:09.790 --> 00:13:10.630
I just thought.

00:13:10.630 --> 00:13:11.800
So I thought that.

00:13:11.800 --> 00:13:15.010
So then I thought about
puppies in a meadow,

00:13:15.010 --> 00:13:18.250
running in the field, and
flowers and cake, of course.

00:13:18.250 --> 00:13:21.010
And then Bobby Flay
came up to me and said,

00:13:21.010 --> 00:13:24.040
the best thing about this
is how much you deserve it.

00:13:24.040 --> 00:13:27.070
And I just thought,
I can die now.

00:13:27.070 --> 00:13:28.630
I mean, we're good.

00:13:28.630 --> 00:13:29.710
I went home.

00:13:29.710 --> 00:13:32.140
I did this show once
and I didn't win, just

00:13:32.140 --> 00:13:32.780
so we're clear.

00:13:32.780 --> 00:13:33.790
CHARITY WORRELL: We
won't talk about that.

00:13:33.790 --> 00:13:35.498
ALEX GUARNASCHELLI:
No, we will, we will.

00:13:35.498 --> 00:13:38.519
We'll talk about
the flawed journey.

00:13:38.519 --> 00:13:40.060
And so they called
me, and they said,

00:13:40.060 --> 00:13:45.640
you know we want to do
a redemption series.

00:13:45.640 --> 00:13:47.030
Will you do it?

00:13:47.030 --> 00:13:48.402
And I said, no.

00:13:48.402 --> 00:13:49.610
I'm not going to do it again.

00:13:49.610 --> 00:13:50.480
I just can't.

00:13:50.480 --> 00:13:53.974
I can't have my
heart broken twice.

00:13:53.974 --> 00:13:56.390
Many of you have dated people
and broken up and been like,

00:13:56.390 --> 00:13:58.973
I'm never talking to them again,
and then the next day, you're

00:13:58.973 --> 00:14:01.520
like, what time is dinner?

00:14:01.520 --> 00:14:04.190
I was really like on the
breakup trail with this show.

00:14:04.190 --> 00:14:05.930
And I called my
mother, and I said,

00:14:05.930 --> 00:14:07.847
they want me to do the
next "Iron Chef" again.

00:14:07.847 --> 00:14:09.971
And she said, oh, don't do
those competition shows.

00:14:09.971 --> 00:14:10.900
You're so bad at them.

00:14:10.900 --> 00:14:14.210
CHARITY WORRELL: Oh, nice.

00:14:14.210 --> 00:14:16.460
ALEX GUARNASCHELLI:
Snapshot, childhood, damaged.

00:14:16.460 --> 00:14:17.830
Questions?

00:14:17.830 --> 00:14:20.720
I'll take questions on that one.

00:14:20.720 --> 00:14:23.480
So I did it, and I-- well,
I said to the Food Network,

00:14:23.480 --> 00:14:27.380
can I do it but can you
guarantee that I win?

00:14:27.380 --> 00:14:29.310
I think that's fair, guys.

00:14:29.310 --> 00:14:30.770
It's like the fair
playing field.

00:14:30.770 --> 00:14:32.630
I win.

00:14:32.630 --> 00:14:35.480
And they said, no.

00:14:35.480 --> 00:14:38.240
So that didn't work.

00:14:38.240 --> 00:14:43.460
And I remember just my cell
phone ran out of juice,

00:14:43.460 --> 00:14:44.480
and I was on the street.

00:14:44.480 --> 00:14:47.260
And there was like a payphone
on the corner where I live.

00:14:47.260 --> 00:14:49.290
So I'm half a block
from my apartment

00:14:49.290 --> 00:14:51.980
but on the pay phone with my
agent, like, I cant' do this.

00:14:51.980 --> 00:14:54.320
So every time I look at that
pay phone, now, I'm like,

00:14:54.320 --> 00:14:56.210
pshew you know,
like what a dope.

00:14:56.210 --> 00:15:00.200
But I really just thought
if I don't do this again,

00:15:00.200 --> 00:15:04.520
if I don't take a
chance on myself again,

00:15:04.520 --> 00:15:05.901
I won't forgive myself.

00:15:05.901 --> 00:15:07.900
CHARITY WORRELL: Did that
open up a lot of doors

00:15:07.900 --> 00:15:09.985
to then be featured more
on the Food Network?

00:15:09.985 --> 00:15:13.320
Because every time I
turn the Food Network on,

00:15:13.320 --> 00:15:14.530
you're on everything.

00:15:14.530 --> 00:15:14.830
ALEX GUARNASCHELLI:
I have people

00:15:14.830 --> 00:15:16.810
CHARITY WORRELL: You won
"Guy's Grocery Games,"

00:15:16.810 --> 00:15:19.540
you're on "Beat Bobby
Flay," you're on "Chopped."

00:15:19.540 --> 00:15:23.110
ALEX GUARNASCHELLI: I'm
involved with the mafia.

00:15:23.110 --> 00:15:24.920
I know, it's so weird.

00:15:24.920 --> 00:15:27.910
I turn it on, like,
ah, you again?

00:15:27.910 --> 00:15:29.936
It's really hard
to watch yourself.

00:15:29.936 --> 00:15:31.310
I like the episodes
of "Chopped."

00:15:31.310 --> 00:15:35.380
I enjoy them more when I'm
not on them, watching them.

00:15:35.380 --> 00:15:37.030
It's really interesting for me.

00:15:37.030 --> 00:15:40.060
Every year, I have a
different favorite judge.

00:15:40.060 --> 00:15:41.560
I'm like, look at you this year.

00:15:41.560 --> 00:15:42.850
Look at you.

00:15:42.850 --> 00:15:45.490
But every year, we go to the
set of "Chopped," and say,

00:15:45.490 --> 00:15:47.230
we're here again?

00:15:47.230 --> 00:15:48.680
We can't believe it.

00:15:48.680 --> 00:15:51.990
And then I fall into a "Chopped"
marathon on my own couch.

00:15:51.990 --> 00:15:53.740
So I'll come home from
shooting "Chopped,"

00:15:53.740 --> 00:15:57.250
and Eva and I will watch
four episodes of "Chopped."

00:15:57.250 --> 00:16:01.587
Net, net, I never want
to see Ted Allen again.

00:16:01.587 --> 00:16:02.920
He's like, come over for dinner.

00:16:02.920 --> 00:16:04.366
I'm like, no.

00:16:04.366 --> 00:16:08.200
I'm so sick of you.

00:16:08.200 --> 00:16:11.920
CHARITY WORRELL: When I watched
the "Guy's Grocery Games,"

00:16:11.920 --> 00:16:14.710
you won on the
frozen feud, where

00:16:14.710 --> 00:16:19.630
you took scallops and
frozen lemon sorbet

00:16:19.630 --> 00:16:22.690
and made some fancy dinner.

00:16:22.690 --> 00:16:23.620
How did you do that?

00:16:25.390 --> 00:16:27.440
ALEX GUARNASCHELLI:
I'm really neurotic.

00:16:27.440 --> 00:16:28.989
I love a supermarket, seriously.

00:16:28.989 --> 00:16:31.030
CHARITY WORRELL: Sorbet,
I would have never think

00:16:31.030 --> 00:16:33.360
to use that in a savory dish.

00:16:33.360 --> 00:16:35.560
ALEX GUARNASCHELLI:
Well, that's Guy, OK?

00:16:35.560 --> 00:16:41.050
That's the Land of Guy, who is
an unbelievable human being,

00:16:41.050 --> 00:16:42.500
astoundingly smart.

00:16:42.500 --> 00:16:43.540
CHARITY WORRELL: He's on
there as much as you are.

00:16:43.540 --> 00:16:44.998
Every time I turn
it on, I'm either

00:16:44.998 --> 00:16:47.207
watching "Chopped" or "Diners,
Drive-ins, and Dives."

00:16:47.207 --> 00:16:48.789
ALEX GUARNASCHELLI:
Oh, yeah, well, he

00:16:48.789 --> 00:16:51.340
says I'm shooting Triple D,
and then I'm going to Triple G.

00:16:51.340 --> 00:16:52.480
And I'm like, oh, my god.

00:16:52.480 --> 00:16:56.220
You're making your way through
the alphabet with your shows.

00:16:56.220 --> 00:16:57.550
That show is so awesome.

00:16:57.550 --> 00:16:59.590
I love running
around a supermarket.

00:16:59.590 --> 00:17:01.270
It's an incredible set.

00:17:01.270 --> 00:17:03.670
It's a supermarket,
fully loaded.

00:17:03.670 --> 00:17:06.500
And I'll catch Guy in the
aisle snacking on stuff.

00:17:06.500 --> 00:17:08.900
He's like, this
product's really good.

00:17:08.900 --> 00:17:10.790
So the next challenge,
they set us free,

00:17:10.790 --> 00:17:12.480
and I just take all
the stuff Guy liked.

00:17:12.480 --> 00:17:16.030
I'm like, oh, look Guy,
do you like this dish?

00:17:16.030 --> 00:17:17.859
I get him to open
cans and jars for me

00:17:17.859 --> 00:17:19.480
while he's standing there.

00:17:19.480 --> 00:17:24.609
He is really fun to work
with, and I love the show.

00:17:24.609 --> 00:17:27.400
So I don't know, something
about the supermarket.

00:17:27.400 --> 00:17:29.770
I mean, it's basically
"Chopped" is a great training

00:17:29.770 --> 00:17:32.800
ground for any other
competition show for me.

00:17:32.800 --> 00:17:34.780
And I'm so unbelievably
competitive.

00:17:34.780 --> 00:17:37.750
I mean people are like,
well, I like this sorbet.

00:17:37.750 --> 00:17:40.300
And I'm like, why do you
like that one better?

00:17:40.300 --> 00:17:42.430
It takes nothing for
me to get rolling.

00:17:42.430 --> 00:17:45.150
I mean, I'll fight you
right now for this cookbook.

00:17:45.150 --> 00:17:48.450
I'm kidding, sort of.

00:17:48.450 --> 00:17:50.290
But I really am
competitive and it's

00:17:50.290 --> 00:17:55.210
been such a privilege to
be able to compete on TV

00:17:55.210 --> 00:17:57.250
and call that part of what I do.

00:17:57.250 --> 00:18:00.680
I started out on "Food Network
Challenge" years and years ago.

00:18:00.680 --> 00:18:02.080
I did a Thanksgiving challenge.

00:18:02.080 --> 00:18:04.510
We had five hours to make
a Thanksgiving dinner,

00:18:04.510 --> 00:18:08.090
and it filmed in Denver,
Colorado and I had never been.

00:18:08.090 --> 00:18:10.832
And I really didn't know about
the cooking and altitude thing.

00:18:10.832 --> 00:18:12.040
I didn't think that was real.

00:18:12.040 --> 00:18:12.956
I'm like, oh, come on.

00:18:12.956 --> 00:18:14.657
What's this silly
little mountain stuff?

00:18:14.657 --> 00:18:16.490
CHARITY WORRELL: It
makes such a difference.

00:18:16.490 --> 00:18:17.770
I learned about
this on "Top Chef."

00:18:17.770 --> 00:18:18.640
ALEX GUARNASCHELLI:
Yeah, I mean,

00:18:18.640 --> 00:18:21.040
I tried to make mashed
potatoes, and it never happened.

00:18:21.040 --> 00:18:23.520
Five hours, I kept believing.

00:18:23.520 --> 00:18:26.800
There is like hold on to-- you
know the kitten on the branch,

00:18:26.800 --> 00:18:28.150
like, hang in there?

00:18:28.150 --> 00:18:30.940
That kind of poster,
I was the poster child

00:18:30.940 --> 00:18:33.800
for hoping that the
altitude was not a reality.

00:18:33.800 --> 00:18:36.410
So I didn't win, and I thought,
well, if you don't win,

00:18:36.410 --> 00:18:38.530
you don't get asked
to be on TV again.

00:18:38.530 --> 00:18:39.880
But boy, do they like a loser.

00:18:39.880 --> 00:18:42.340
They were like
Guarnaschelli, how are ya'?

00:18:42.340 --> 00:18:44.710
I saw you lost in
most glorious fashion.

00:18:44.710 --> 00:18:46.619
Are you busy?

00:18:46.619 --> 00:18:47.410
Well, I don't know.

00:18:47.410 --> 00:18:49.659
I was at home, fielding all
my offers from having just

00:18:49.659 --> 00:18:51.850
lost the competition show.

00:18:51.850 --> 00:18:53.350
So it snowballed.

00:18:53.350 --> 00:18:55.930
I did some-- I judged
some "Iron Chef."

00:18:55.930 --> 00:18:59.830
I met Bobby Flay, who I
famously really didn't like.

00:18:59.830 --> 00:19:02.440
I used to turn on Food Network
and be like, who's this guy?

00:19:02.440 --> 00:19:05.110
Thinks he's so cool with
his grill and his spatula

00:19:05.110 --> 00:19:08.680
and his stupid hamburgers.

00:19:08.680 --> 00:19:10.720
And I couldn't have been
more wrong about that.

00:19:10.720 --> 00:19:15.070
So I did some daytime cooking
stuff, and then I just,

00:19:15.070 --> 00:19:16.180
"Chopped" came along.

00:19:16.180 --> 00:19:18.885
And I just-- oh, I said no to--

00:19:18.885 --> 00:19:21.010
the producer called me
about "Chopped," and I said,

00:19:21.010 --> 00:19:22.780
I don't want to be on that show.

00:19:22.780 --> 00:19:26.050
Seems like it won't be a hit.

00:19:26.050 --> 00:19:29.340
You guys think my career as
a TV exec is just, no, right?

00:19:29.340 --> 00:19:32.314
Like no, let it go.

00:19:32.314 --> 00:19:34.730
And they just kept calling--
really, I mean I have to say,

00:19:34.730 --> 00:19:39.130
there was one Food
Network producer, exec,

00:19:39.130 --> 00:19:42.820
who just stalked me and
said, just go once to the set

00:19:42.820 --> 00:19:44.254
and do one episode.

00:19:44.254 --> 00:19:46.420
And if you don't like it,
you don't have to go back.

00:19:46.420 --> 00:19:48.550
So I shot one
episode of "Chopped."

00:19:48.550 --> 00:19:50.980
And the floor
producer said, what

00:19:50.980 --> 00:19:53.620
do we have to do to get
you to do this show?

00:19:53.620 --> 00:19:57.320
And I said, I always have
to sit in the middle.

00:19:57.320 --> 00:19:59.650
So I'm the only judge who
always sits in the middle.

00:19:59.650 --> 00:20:01.150
CHARITY WORRELL:
You're not kidding.

00:20:01.150 --> 00:20:01.730
ALEX GUARNASCHELLI:
Center square.

00:20:01.730 --> 00:20:03.070
I used to watch the
"Hollywood Squares."

00:20:03.070 --> 00:20:04.361
I was like who's in the middle?

00:20:04.361 --> 00:20:08.440
Who cares about the suburbs?

00:20:08.440 --> 00:20:09.550
Seemed like a good move.

00:20:09.550 --> 00:20:11.170
You know what I'm saying, guys?

00:20:11.170 --> 00:20:12.100
CHARITY WORRELL:
When you're judging,

00:20:12.100 --> 00:20:13.700
is there anything
you've been given

00:20:13.700 --> 00:20:15.365
that's been just awful tasting?

00:20:15.365 --> 00:20:16.990
ALEX GUARNASCHELLI:
Yeah, all the time.

00:20:16.990 --> 00:20:17.620
CHARITY WORRELL: Really?

00:20:17.620 --> 00:20:18.460
ALEX GUARNASCHELLI: Yeah.

00:20:18.460 --> 00:20:18.990
Oh, wait.

00:20:18.990 --> 00:20:19.890
Let me rephrase that.

00:20:19.890 --> 00:20:23.260
No, nothing.

00:20:23.260 --> 00:20:25.154
There's been a lot
of awful stuff.

00:20:25.154 --> 00:20:27.070
And there are a lot of
ingredients that if you

00:20:27.070 --> 00:20:29.740
didn't grow up eating them,
you don't have an understanding

00:20:29.740 --> 00:20:34.150
of them that's ingrained in
you, you, cannot fake that.

00:20:34.150 --> 00:20:36.520
I have ingredients I'm
given where I'm like, nah.

00:20:36.520 --> 00:20:38.920
I needed to start with this
ingredient at the age of 10,

00:20:38.920 --> 00:20:41.590
either eating it or
cooking it or both

00:20:41.590 --> 00:20:42.640
to really understand it.

00:20:42.640 --> 00:20:46.570
And that's where culture is
a card to play on "Chopped,"

00:20:46.570 --> 00:20:50.200
and if you happen to get an
ingredient in the basket that's

00:20:50.200 --> 00:20:52.120
part of your cultural
background or part

00:20:52.120 --> 00:20:54.850
of what you ate
growing up, that's

00:20:54.850 --> 00:20:59.170
a big advantage, and that's
like a luck thing, in a way.

00:20:59.170 --> 00:21:01.090
But yeah, I've had
some hideous stuff.

00:21:01.090 --> 00:21:02.290
Oh, my god.

00:21:02.290 --> 00:21:06.521
And the worst is when the nicest
person makes the worst dish,

00:21:06.521 --> 00:21:08.770
and you're like, I would
love to have drinks with you,

00:21:08.770 --> 00:21:13.300
but you're about to meet
that hallway and get chopped,

00:21:13.300 --> 00:21:13.990
and that's hard.

00:21:13.990 --> 00:21:16.570
Or when someone
is an amazing chef

00:21:16.570 --> 00:21:20.320
with an incredible pedigree
and doesn't have the confidence

00:21:20.320 --> 00:21:22.919
in that context and blows it.

00:21:22.919 --> 00:21:24.460
I can't tell you
how many times we've

00:21:24.460 --> 00:21:26.260
had the best cook
out of the four

00:21:26.260 --> 00:21:27.730
of them blow it
on the first round

00:21:27.730 --> 00:21:29.899
and leave two of
the ingredients off.

00:21:29.899 --> 00:21:30.940
And they're like, I know.

00:21:30.940 --> 00:21:31.815
It was sitting there.

00:21:31.815 --> 00:21:34.372
And you're like, my
whole day was based

00:21:34.372 --> 00:21:35.580
on what you were going to do.

00:21:35.580 --> 00:21:38.110
What am I supposed to do now?

00:21:38.110 --> 00:21:41.080
And I think that's why the
judges on "Chopped" are unique.

00:21:41.080 --> 00:21:43.720
I think-- I call us
the cast of "Friends."

00:21:43.720 --> 00:21:45.989
I think you pick, like we
all do, with "Friends."

00:21:45.989 --> 00:21:46.780
You don't know why.

00:21:46.780 --> 00:21:49.450
Like some days you just feel
Chandler-y, some days you

00:21:49.450 --> 00:21:52.360
feel Monica-y, Some days
you're singing "Smelly Cat."

00:21:52.360 --> 00:21:55.180
I think people do the same
thing with the "Chopped" judges.

00:21:55.180 --> 00:21:57.850
Sometimes we feel
debonair, Zakarian.

00:21:57.850 --> 00:22:01.870
Sometimes we feel like
nebulous and strange, Santos.

00:22:01.870 --> 00:22:04.060
You know it depends
on what you're vibing.

00:22:04.060 --> 00:22:06.040
I always say Amanda
Freitag is sort

00:22:06.040 --> 00:22:07.775
of the upholder
of cooking truth.

00:22:07.775 --> 00:22:10.150
She's like, everything you
did was unbelievably creative,

00:22:10.150 --> 00:22:11.560
but your chicken is overcooked.

00:22:11.560 --> 00:22:14.080
And I'm like--

00:22:14.080 --> 00:22:17.540
I'm much more of a kumbaya,
like, oh, you made a drawing.

00:22:17.540 --> 00:22:18.260
How creative.

00:22:18.260 --> 00:22:21.400
If I tilt it this
way, I understand it.

00:22:21.400 --> 00:22:24.790
Amanda goes right for the
truth of the food, you know?

00:22:24.790 --> 00:22:26.564
So it's so
interesting, that mix.

00:22:26.564 --> 00:22:28.480
CHARITY WORRELL: How do
they choose, or do you

00:22:28.480 --> 00:22:30.100
know how they choose
the ingredients?

00:22:30.100 --> 00:22:31.933
ALEX GUARNASCHELLI:
It's a "Chopped" secret.

00:22:31.933 --> 00:22:34.750
No, Food Network, we
have a whole staff

00:22:34.750 --> 00:22:36.190
of people that
choose the baskets.

00:22:36.190 --> 00:22:39.550
You can make suggestions.

00:22:39.550 --> 00:22:43.494
You can beg and plead for
things not to be in there.

00:22:43.494 --> 00:22:46.840
But it's a group
of people, a group

00:22:46.840 --> 00:22:52.690
of trained experts that just
sit around googling things.

00:22:52.690 --> 00:22:56.020
So step it up, guys.

00:22:56.020 --> 00:22:59.569
CHARITY WORRELL: What is the
best meal that you've ever had?

00:22:59.569 --> 00:23:00.610
ALEX GUARNASCHELLI: What?

00:23:00.610 --> 00:23:02.068
CHARITY WORRELL:
Well, I know mine.

00:23:02.068 --> 00:23:03.590
That's why I always
ask people this.

00:23:03.590 --> 00:23:05.964
ALEX GUARNASCHELLI: God, that
takes real presence of mind

00:23:05.964 --> 00:23:07.340
to know something like that.

00:23:07.340 --> 00:23:08.507
The best meal I've ever had?

00:23:08.507 --> 00:23:10.340
CHARITY WORRELL: You
never had an experience

00:23:10.340 --> 00:23:12.500
where you're just like,
wow, this is like top 10?

00:23:12.500 --> 00:23:13.745
ALEX GUARNASCHELLI: Yeah.

00:23:13.745 --> 00:23:14.720
I ate in a--

00:23:14.720 --> 00:23:16.580
I lived in France for
almost seven years.

00:23:16.580 --> 00:23:19.580
Almost all my 20s, I
spent living in France.

00:23:19.580 --> 00:23:22.970
And I went down to Nice
randomly for a couple of days

00:23:22.970 --> 00:23:24.230
in the Riviera.

00:23:24.230 --> 00:23:26.282
And there was a little
hole in the wall--

00:23:26.282 --> 00:23:27.740
it's not really a
hole in the wall,

00:23:27.740 --> 00:23:29.750
but it's small and
very homey bistro.

00:23:29.750 --> 00:23:32.060
They don't have
phones, and they have

00:23:32.060 --> 00:23:34.310
just communal tables with
these very uncomfortable

00:23:34.310 --> 00:23:35.780
little stools.

00:23:35.780 --> 00:23:39.290
And the wife is on the floor,
taking orders and seating

00:23:39.290 --> 00:23:42.230
guests, and the husband
is cooking, and that's it.

00:23:42.230 --> 00:23:45.290
And so it was literally
like, I grew up

00:23:45.290 --> 00:23:48.290
an only child with my
parents, and that's my family.

00:23:48.290 --> 00:23:50.630
I mean, a lot of people
have eight million cousins.

00:23:50.630 --> 00:23:53.960
And I'm Italian, like you figure
I got a million cousins and all

00:23:53.960 --> 00:23:54.860
that.

00:23:54.860 --> 00:23:57.830
I'm just, I'm very lean
in the family department.

00:23:57.830 --> 00:23:59.600
And it felt like my
mother and my father,

00:23:59.600 --> 00:24:03.050
so right away it was a setup
that felt very homey to me.

00:24:03.050 --> 00:24:07.030
And then the husband dropped
fresh pasta, boiling hot

00:24:07.030 --> 00:24:11.810
and water, the pasta water on
basil pesto in a giant bowl

00:24:11.810 --> 00:24:14.510
next to where I was
sitting and just tossed it.

00:24:14.510 --> 00:24:17.842
And the steam wafted
over, and I just cried.

00:24:17.842 --> 00:24:18.800
And I was like, really?

00:24:18.800 --> 00:24:20.966
You're going to cry like
"Like Water for Chocolate,"

00:24:20.966 --> 00:24:22.010
like "Eat, Pray, Love."

00:24:22.010 --> 00:24:24.110
Like, I had a
personal revelation,

00:24:24.110 --> 00:24:25.820
and now I'm amazing.

00:24:25.820 --> 00:24:26.390
Not at all.

00:24:26.390 --> 00:24:29.450
It just smelled really good, and
I wanted to eat the whole bowl.

00:24:29.450 --> 00:24:32.240
And so I ate that pasta
like a complete savage.

00:24:32.240 --> 00:24:36.230
I mean, I think utensils were
just kind of on the periphery

00:24:36.230 --> 00:24:38.360
of my behavior.

00:24:38.360 --> 00:24:40.280
And he made some rabbit
and some other stuff,

00:24:40.280 --> 00:24:42.360
and I just kind of cried a lot.

00:24:42.360 --> 00:24:43.010
I didn't talk.

00:24:43.010 --> 00:24:44.870
I just cried.

00:24:44.870 --> 00:24:48.020
And I can't say food,
generally makes me do that.

00:24:48.020 --> 00:24:51.050
I mean, on "Chopped," I
cry for different reasons.

00:24:51.050 --> 00:24:53.180
So yeah, that might be it.

00:24:53.180 --> 00:24:55.160
And I like that, no
phone, no nothing.

00:24:55.160 --> 00:24:56.580
You want to go?

00:24:56.580 --> 00:24:57.500
You've got to roll up.

00:24:57.500 --> 00:24:59.150
It's not on your GPS.

00:24:59.150 --> 00:25:02.200
It's just, God, you've
got to really put

00:25:02.200 --> 00:25:04.210
some goji berries in
your pouch and climb

00:25:04.210 --> 00:25:09.360
a mountain wearing a loin cloth
to find this place, old school.

00:25:09.360 --> 00:25:11.110
CHARITY WORRELL: If
any of my team's here,

00:25:11.110 --> 00:25:12.910
they know that whenever
I plan off-sites,

00:25:12.910 --> 00:25:15.250
I always add an
activity or food tours,

00:25:15.250 --> 00:25:17.379
because I am obsessed with them.

00:25:17.379 --> 00:25:19.420
I love traveling, and I
feel like that's the best

00:25:19.420 --> 00:25:20.990
way to get to know a place.

00:25:20.990 --> 00:25:22.087
Have you ever done one?

00:25:22.087 --> 00:25:23.420
ALEX GUARNASCHELLI: A food tour?

00:25:23.420 --> 00:25:24.952
CHARITY WORRELL: Yeah.

00:25:24.952 --> 00:25:25.910
ALEX GUARNASCHELLI: No,

00:25:25.910 --> 00:25:26.743
CHARITY WORRELL: No?

00:25:26.743 --> 00:25:28.745
Are you anti, or
just never done one?

00:25:28.745 --> 00:25:31.370
ALEX GUARNASCHELLI: I'm going to
put it to like this, honestly,

00:25:31.370 --> 00:25:36.140
it's really hard for me to
have food be any more a part

00:25:36.140 --> 00:25:37.460
of my life than it already is.

00:25:37.460 --> 00:25:39.920
In fact, the fight
for me is to have

00:25:39.920 --> 00:25:41.510
something not food-related.

00:25:41.510 --> 00:25:43.760
People say, well, what are
your hobbies that round you

00:25:43.760 --> 00:25:44.900
out and give you balance?

00:25:44.900 --> 00:25:47.360
Like, how do you find balance?

00:25:47.360 --> 00:25:50.840
A, I think that's completely
unrealistic as a goal, first

00:25:50.840 --> 00:25:51.350
of all.

00:25:51.350 --> 00:25:54.030
Second of all, it's definitely
not happening for me,

00:25:54.030 --> 00:25:56.070
and I'm not going to
lie about it anymore.

00:25:56.070 --> 00:25:58.380
This is where I come
out with the truth.

00:25:58.380 --> 00:26:01.700
I am not a balanced human, and
I don't have a balanced life.

00:26:01.700 --> 00:26:03.620
I like my child.

00:26:03.620 --> 00:26:04.400
I like food.

00:26:04.400 --> 00:26:05.960
I like flowers.

00:26:05.960 --> 00:26:08.590
I like boating and
needlepointing.

00:26:08.590 --> 00:26:12.740
So my desire, if I
have any free time

00:26:12.740 --> 00:26:15.350
is to do something that
doesn't have to do with food

00:26:15.350 --> 00:26:16.910
and that's hard.

00:26:16.910 --> 00:26:19.610
I'm like, oh, we're going to
a pumpkin farm and an apple

00:26:19.610 --> 00:26:22.100
orchard, that's
not food-related.

00:26:22.100 --> 00:26:24.440
That's my idea of kind of
getting out of the kitchen

00:26:24.440 --> 00:26:25.860
and not thinking about food.

00:26:25.860 --> 00:26:27.110
I went to the beach yesterday.

00:26:27.110 --> 00:26:29.000
I'm like, I wonder what's--

00:26:29.000 --> 00:26:30.440
is that a blue fish?

00:26:30.440 --> 00:26:34.100
No matter where I am, I
find something to eat,

00:26:34.100 --> 00:26:35.900
creatures to cook.

00:26:35.900 --> 00:26:38.660
Not you, yet.

00:26:38.660 --> 00:26:40.210
No, I'm kidding.

00:26:40.210 --> 00:26:41.780
Do you know what I mean?

00:26:41.780 --> 00:26:47.147
So no, but I admire people
that do, and I like you a lot.

00:26:47.147 --> 00:26:47.980
CHARITY WORRELL: No.

00:26:47.980 --> 00:26:49.010
It's my favorite thing.

00:26:49.010 --> 00:26:52.310
I always find I learn the
most, and I learn about these

00:26:52.310 --> 00:26:54.260
off-the-beaten-path
kind of places,

00:26:54.260 --> 00:26:57.230
and I always usually go the
first day I'm somewhere,

00:26:57.230 --> 00:27:00.084
so I had nowhere to go
the rest of the time.

00:27:00.084 --> 00:27:02.000
ALEX GUARNASCHELLI:
Getting lost wherever I am

00:27:02.000 --> 00:27:04.820
and finding those
places, I do that a lot.

00:27:04.820 --> 00:27:07.150
I mean, I was in
Cleveland recently,

00:27:07.150 --> 00:27:09.840
and I just found Little
Italy and just walked around,

00:27:09.840 --> 00:27:13.480
and just wanted to
feel Italian vaguely.

00:27:13.480 --> 00:27:14.480
I had like six cannolis.

00:27:14.480 --> 00:27:17.870
I figure that's what
Italians are doing.

00:27:17.870 --> 00:27:19.670
So yeah, I understand that, yes.

00:27:19.670 --> 00:27:21.770
But you mean organized
tours, like here's where

00:27:21.770 --> 00:27:23.200
the first potato was cooked?

00:27:23.200 --> 00:27:25.180
Just no, no.

00:27:25.180 --> 00:27:28.640
CHARITY WORRELL: What, of
everything you've done so far,

00:27:28.640 --> 00:27:32.750
what have you enjoyed the most
of your career, the TV shows,

00:27:32.750 --> 00:27:37.630
the executive chef
part, the cookbooks?

00:27:37.630 --> 00:27:40.540
ALEX GUARNASCHELLI:
Honestly, really, I'm

00:27:40.540 --> 00:27:43.880
privileged to say I enjoy
almost all of what I do.

00:27:43.880 --> 00:27:46.022
I don't like when the
dishwashers are drunk

00:27:46.022 --> 00:27:47.730
and they don't show
up at the restaurant.

00:27:47.730 --> 00:27:49.780
That, I can do without.

00:27:49.780 --> 00:27:51.730
I wish, sometimes, that
I had become a plumber

00:27:51.730 --> 00:27:54.760
so that I didn't need to rely
on other people to fix stuff.

00:27:54.760 --> 00:27:57.580
That was the math I did when
I graduated from college.

00:27:57.580 --> 00:28:00.010
Do I want to be a
plumber or a chef?

00:28:00.010 --> 00:28:02.800
And I'm like, kinda,
it's iffy, guys,

00:28:02.800 --> 00:28:04.890
because they're actually
the same profession,

00:28:04.890 --> 00:28:07.480
just one has onions
and one has a toilet.

00:28:07.480 --> 00:28:11.750
So it's maybe
slightly different.

00:28:11.750 --> 00:28:17.500
But probably cooking
in the restaurant

00:28:17.500 --> 00:28:19.870
is the thing that
speaks most to me.

00:28:19.870 --> 00:28:23.140
And I think that's why when
I've been on these TV shows,

00:28:23.140 --> 00:28:25.670
it just feels like I'm at
the restaurant cooking.

00:28:25.670 --> 00:28:28.810
And so people say, is a
camera daunting to you

00:28:28.810 --> 00:28:29.860
or whatever else?

00:28:29.860 --> 00:28:35.215
I get so lost in the sauce
that I don't feel the camera.

00:28:35.215 --> 00:28:37.090
A lot of times, when
I'm competing, I'll say,

00:28:37.090 --> 00:28:39.724
get out of the way
to the camera people.

00:28:39.724 --> 00:28:41.890
Because they'll be filming,
and I'll have hot water.

00:28:41.890 --> 00:28:47.200
And they're so close to me,
and I'm so in my planet,

00:28:47.200 --> 00:28:49.270
I could hurt a camera person.

00:28:49.270 --> 00:28:51.100
And so I say, get
out of the way,

00:28:51.100 --> 00:28:53.701
and they cut it in to make
it sound like I'm saying,

00:28:53.701 --> 00:28:54.700
everyone, out of my way.

00:28:54.700 --> 00:28:57.640
So I get all this
mail, like, we just

00:28:57.640 --> 00:29:00.750
think you could be
a little bit nicer.

00:29:00.750 --> 00:29:03.880
And I'm like, you try this.

00:29:03.880 --> 00:29:07.210
So that's been kind of funny
for me, but I get lost.

00:29:07.210 --> 00:29:10.570
I got to say, just pure
cooking under pressure

00:29:10.570 --> 00:29:13.300
of any kind, that's
my whatever that is.

00:29:13.300 --> 00:29:15.130
CHARITY WORRELL: How
often do you still

00:29:15.130 --> 00:29:16.120
go into the restaurant?

00:29:16.120 --> 00:29:18.661
Because I feel like you have to
be so busy with the cookbook,

00:29:18.661 --> 00:29:21.291
especially now you're promoting
it, and with the TV shows

00:29:21.291 --> 00:29:21.790
you do.

00:29:21.790 --> 00:29:24.059
Where do you have time?

00:29:24.059 --> 00:29:26.350
ALEX GUARNASCHELLI: I can go
to the restaurant anywhere

00:29:26.350 --> 00:29:29.250
from zero to five times
on any given week.

00:29:29.250 --> 00:29:30.030
It depends.

00:29:30.030 --> 00:29:34.120
So and I mean, generally,
it varies that wildly.

00:29:34.120 --> 00:29:36.190
But I have one restaurant.

00:29:36.190 --> 00:29:38.890
Unlike a lot of other
chefs, I only have one,

00:29:38.890 --> 00:29:41.210
and I've had it for 17 years.

00:29:41.210 --> 00:29:43.220
So it's like a family to me.

00:29:43.220 --> 00:29:45.400
To go there and
be in the kitchen

00:29:45.400 --> 00:29:49.780
and eating gnocchi mac and
cheese on the line and hide.

00:29:49.780 --> 00:29:51.070
That's like one of my--

00:29:51.070 --> 00:29:53.290
come on.

00:29:53.290 --> 00:29:53.830
I'm at work.

00:29:53.830 --> 00:29:56.020
I'm very busy.

00:29:56.020 --> 00:29:58.300
So a lot.

00:29:58.300 --> 00:30:04.370
And I can take a taxi to it from
where I live, very important.

00:30:04.370 --> 00:30:05.337
And I love the people.

00:30:05.337 --> 00:30:06.670
They're better people than I am.

00:30:06.670 --> 00:30:09.174
It's good to be around people
that are better than you.

00:30:09.174 --> 00:30:11.340
CHARITY WORRELL: Well,
that's amazing to have had it

00:30:11.340 --> 00:30:14.070
for 17 years, because so many
restaurants come into New York

00:30:14.070 --> 00:30:16.642
City and just fail.

00:30:16.642 --> 00:30:18.600
ALEX GUARNASCHELLI: I
read the review of Butter

00:30:18.600 --> 00:30:20.520
before I worked there
in the "New York Times,"

00:30:20.520 --> 00:30:23.010
and I said, this sounds like
a real happening, hip joint.

00:30:23.010 --> 00:30:24.885
I want to go there
before it closes.

00:30:24.885 --> 00:30:27.385
I read the review, and I thought
there's something charming.

00:30:27.385 --> 00:30:28.540
I want to go there.

00:30:28.540 --> 00:30:31.200
So a friend of a friend kind
of thing, said go down there.

00:30:31.200 --> 00:30:32.370
They're looking for a chef.

00:30:32.370 --> 00:30:34.140
So I went there, and there
was like a disco ball

00:30:34.140 --> 00:30:34.770
on the ceiling.

00:30:34.770 --> 00:30:38.970
And the waiter was like,
hey, what do you want to eat?

00:30:38.970 --> 00:30:40.830
And I thought, no.

00:30:40.830 --> 00:30:43.170
This has nothing to do
with all the experience I

00:30:43.170 --> 00:30:46.200
had had up to that point.

00:30:46.200 --> 00:30:49.950
But I went in the kitchen, and I
looked at the chefs, the cooks.

00:30:49.950 --> 00:30:53.340
And there was one guy that was
like cooking some scallops,

00:30:53.340 --> 00:30:55.860
and he turned around
and he was smiling.

00:30:55.860 --> 00:30:58.080
And I thought, he's
cooking the scallops,

00:30:58.080 --> 00:31:02.400
and the vibration of the
pan is going up his arm

00:31:02.400 --> 00:31:04.830
and making him smile,
because he loves it so much.

00:31:04.830 --> 00:31:07.290
This is what I thought I saw.

00:31:07.290 --> 00:31:09.990
In the sunlight,
you look stunning.

00:31:09.990 --> 00:31:11.699
So I looked at him,
and I saw this smile.

00:31:11.699 --> 00:31:13.281
And he turned around,
and that was it.

00:31:13.281 --> 00:31:14.710
I was like, all right you look--

00:31:14.710 --> 00:31:15.870
this is what's up.

00:31:15.870 --> 00:31:17.650
I miss that.

00:31:17.650 --> 00:31:19.900
And if it's here, I'm
going to work here.

00:31:19.900 --> 00:31:21.270
So I took the job.

00:31:21.270 --> 00:31:23.970
We called Butter We Can't
Believe It's Still Open,

00:31:23.970 --> 00:31:25.680
for like five years.

00:31:25.680 --> 00:31:29.400
Come in every day
like, we're so clever.

00:31:29.400 --> 00:31:31.740
But maybe if you laugh
at yourself all the time

00:31:31.740 --> 00:31:34.460
and work really hard and just
keep it humble and keep moving,

00:31:34.460 --> 00:31:35.670
maybe that works.

00:31:35.670 --> 00:31:37.200
That gentleman
cooking the scallops

00:31:37.200 --> 00:31:40.080
still works with
me, 17 years later.

00:31:40.080 --> 00:31:41.920
He's like my child.

00:31:41.920 --> 00:31:43.170
I'm like, where are you going?

00:31:43.170 --> 00:31:44.040
You've had two beers.

00:31:44.040 --> 00:31:45.123
You're not going anywhere.

00:31:45.123 --> 00:31:46.600
He's like, I'm old now.

00:31:49.220 --> 00:31:50.730
But you never know.

00:31:50.730 --> 00:31:52.110
I really went with it.

00:31:52.110 --> 00:31:55.470
Someone's facial expression
dictated my choice,

00:31:55.470 --> 00:31:57.530
and I've not been sorry since.

00:31:57.530 --> 00:31:59.238
CHARITY WORRELL:
Sometimes you just know.

00:31:59.238 --> 00:32:01.489
You have a feeling about
places, especially with work.

00:32:01.489 --> 00:32:02.738
ALEX GUARNASCHELLI: Work, yes.

00:32:02.738 --> 00:32:04.500
Romantic endeavors
might be a little--

00:32:04.500 --> 00:32:07.620
I might be a little less
clever at maneuvering those.

00:32:07.620 --> 00:32:08.482
That's another talk.

00:32:08.482 --> 00:32:09.690
We'll have Google After Dark.

00:32:12.046 --> 00:32:14.420
CHARITY WORRELL: I will open
it up to some questions now.

00:32:14.420 --> 00:32:17.280
ALEX GUARNASCHELLI: Does
anybody dare ask a question?

00:32:17.280 --> 00:32:18.549
I wouldn't.

00:32:18.549 --> 00:32:19.590
CHARITY WORRELL: Anybody?

00:32:19.590 --> 00:32:20.310
ALEX GUARNASCHELLI: All righty.

00:32:20.310 --> 00:32:21.218
CHARITY WORRELL: Questions?

00:32:21.218 --> 00:32:22.580
AUDIENCE: I've got a question.

00:32:22.580 --> 00:32:24.746
ALEX GUARNASCHELLI: We're
all staring at your shirt.

00:32:28.760 --> 00:32:31.800
AUDIENCE: So you judge people's
food all the time, right?

00:32:31.800 --> 00:32:34.390
So is it hard to turn
off that instinct when

00:32:34.390 --> 00:32:37.030
you're eating or just
getting a slice or whatever?

00:32:37.030 --> 00:32:39.230
ALEX GUARNASCHELLI:
That's a great question.

00:32:39.230 --> 00:32:41.620
I grew up with parents--
my mother would

00:32:41.620 --> 00:32:45.220
cook from the cookbook she
was editing and ask my father

00:32:45.220 --> 00:32:47.140
and me what we thought.

00:32:47.140 --> 00:32:50.260
And she collected 30 years
of "Gourmet" magazine,

00:32:50.260 --> 00:32:51.970
and she would say
is this pumpkin

00:32:51.970 --> 00:32:55.390
pie better than the 1986
version from October

00:32:55.390 --> 00:32:56.390
or what do you think?

00:32:56.390 --> 00:32:59.050
And I'd be, like, well,
the crust is a little bit--

00:32:59.050 --> 00:33:01.300
so I'm going through
this in my head,

00:33:01.300 --> 00:33:03.100
that I did this every
night in my childhood

00:33:03.100 --> 00:33:05.308
and realized that my mother
trained a "Chopped" judge

00:33:05.308 --> 00:33:06.550
by accident.

00:33:06.550 --> 00:33:08.080
So I came from that.

00:33:08.080 --> 00:33:09.640
I'm cut from that cloth.

00:33:09.640 --> 00:33:12.700
And the answer is yes, I
can completely shut off,

00:33:12.700 --> 00:33:16.240
and in most instances,
when I'm eating out, I do.

00:33:16.240 --> 00:33:18.910
Imagine I go to a restaurant
now, and I take a sip of water,

00:33:18.910 --> 00:33:21.110
and everybody stops.

00:33:21.110 --> 00:33:23.020
How is it?

00:33:23.020 --> 00:33:24.140
I'm like, it's tap water.

00:33:24.140 --> 00:33:26.470
You guys crushed it.

00:33:26.470 --> 00:33:29.890
So yeah, I can shut off
and really enjoy food.

00:33:29.890 --> 00:33:34.150
The downside is no one
invites me over for dinner,

00:33:34.150 --> 00:33:35.660
and I have very few friends now.

00:33:38.239 --> 00:33:38.780
AUDIENCE: Hi.

00:33:38.780 --> 00:33:39.430
ALEX GUARNASCHELLI: Hi.

00:33:39.430 --> 00:33:40.120
AUDIENCE: Big fan.

00:33:40.120 --> 00:33:40.570
ALEX GUARNASCHELLI: Thank you.

00:33:40.570 --> 00:33:42.580
AUDIENCE: I'm watching you
and Ava on your Instagram.

00:33:42.580 --> 00:33:42.970
ALEX GUARNASCHELLI: Aww.

00:33:42.970 --> 00:33:44.440
AUDIENCE: It's very cute.

00:33:44.440 --> 00:33:46.810
So you're on a bunch
of different shows,

00:33:46.810 --> 00:33:48.880
a lot of things going
on and we don't really

00:33:48.880 --> 00:33:50.110
get to see behind the scenes.

00:33:50.110 --> 00:33:53.584
Can you give us any, sneak
behind-the-scenes secrets,

00:33:53.584 --> 00:33:55.000
especially for
"Chopped," I guess?

00:33:55.000 --> 00:33:57.130
Since it seems like things
happen so quickly, but how can

00:33:57.130 --> 00:33:59.030
those people really
come up with something?

00:33:59.030 --> 00:34:00.155
ALEX GUARNASCHELLI: Oh, no.

00:34:00.155 --> 00:34:03.110
The reason the show is so
good is because it's all real.

00:34:03.110 --> 00:34:06.850
And I go there every time, and
I say, what more can happen?

00:34:06.850 --> 00:34:07.540
Seriously.

00:34:07.540 --> 00:34:10.389
I go there, and I am the
most skeptical of all.

00:34:10.389 --> 00:34:13.510
And I went there the
last episode we shot,

00:34:13.510 --> 00:34:15.710
somehow someone was
cooking something,

00:34:15.710 --> 00:34:17.610
and it caught on fire.

00:34:17.610 --> 00:34:20.380
Somehow, something in
the pan was flammable

00:34:20.380 --> 00:34:21.736
in an enduring way.

00:34:21.736 --> 00:34:23.110
They threw it in
the garbage can.

00:34:23.110 --> 00:34:24.969
The garbage can caught on fire.

00:34:24.969 --> 00:34:28.510
The set was burning
and I'm like--

00:34:28.510 --> 00:34:34.060
the producer just kind of goes
over the judges' table like--

00:34:34.060 --> 00:34:39.350
because we kind of marvel at
the humanity that is "Chopped."

00:34:39.350 --> 00:34:42.860
And I think now that it's
been on for a few years,

00:34:42.860 --> 00:34:45.210
people come and they expect
that even if they don't win,

00:34:45.210 --> 00:34:46.880
they're going to
have some experience

00:34:46.880 --> 00:34:49.370
and learn about
themselves and grow.

00:34:49.370 --> 00:34:50.420
And guess what?

00:34:50.420 --> 00:34:51.719
They do.

00:34:51.719 --> 00:34:52.219
They do.

00:34:52.219 --> 00:34:54.980
And I say to people stuff
like, they're saying,

00:34:54.980 --> 00:34:56.330
I can't do this.

00:34:56.330 --> 00:34:58.200
And I said this is voluntary.

00:34:58.200 --> 00:34:59.810
You came here today.

00:34:59.810 --> 00:35:01.950
You're going to
win a lot of money.

00:35:01.950 --> 00:35:04.710
You don't want it,
that pisses us off.

00:35:04.710 --> 00:35:07.800
And people just say,
wow, that's cool.

00:35:07.800 --> 00:35:10.320
You know, you need that sit
up straight kind of talk,

00:35:10.320 --> 00:35:12.120
that's what "Chopped" can be.

00:35:12.120 --> 00:35:14.250
As far as behind
the scenes, I think

00:35:14.250 --> 00:35:16.530
I would just say to you
that Scott Conant and I have

00:35:16.530 --> 00:35:18.720
a special relationship
with the craft services

00:35:18.720 --> 00:35:20.460
table, which is
the table of food

00:35:20.460 --> 00:35:22.560
that they put out for the crew.

00:35:22.560 --> 00:35:26.910
That's not really
for us, the judges.

00:35:26.910 --> 00:35:32.050
But if there's a jar of peanut
butter and a plate of cookies,

00:35:32.050 --> 00:35:36.540
Scott and I will go over and to
erase the banana peel fish eye

00:35:36.540 --> 00:35:39.400
sandwich we just
ate, He will just

00:35:39.400 --> 00:35:40.850
start scooping
the peanut butter.

00:35:40.850 --> 00:35:42.580
Like, man, what
were they thinking?

00:35:42.580 --> 00:35:47.270
He's healing through half a jar
of peanut butter, and I'm like,

00:35:47.270 --> 00:35:49.640
you shouldn't eat all
that peanut butter.

00:35:49.640 --> 00:35:53.420
And I'm eating a stack, a
sleeve of cookies, just to heal.

00:35:53.420 --> 00:35:57.200
So I sat down with a
nutritionist one day

00:35:57.200 --> 00:35:59.640
to figure out, what's a day
on "Chopped" like for me?

00:35:59.640 --> 00:36:03.810
And I figured out it's between
5,000 and 6,000 calories.

00:36:03.810 --> 00:36:04.310
Yeah.

00:36:04.310 --> 00:36:09.260
Well, I'm not going to be
a swimsuit model, for sure.

00:36:09.260 --> 00:36:12.990
So I think that's a
really interesting thing.

00:36:12.990 --> 00:36:15.710
People ask me how much do the
judges eat or what do you eat?

00:36:15.710 --> 00:36:19.460
And often, we do what
I call healing eating.

00:36:19.460 --> 00:36:21.710
I will go to something I
have always known to be good,

00:36:21.710 --> 00:36:24.920
and I will eat this, and all
will be healed in the land.

00:36:24.920 --> 00:36:29.420
And it works, but then you
get elastic waist pants,

00:36:29.420 --> 00:36:31.850
so that's the trade-off.

00:36:31.850 --> 00:36:35.040
I would say to you, behind
the scenes on "Chopped,"

00:36:35.040 --> 00:36:37.590
they open the basket, Ted
says your time starts now,

00:36:37.590 --> 00:36:39.180
and they start cooking.

00:36:39.180 --> 00:36:43.710
And there's no extra wait, stop,
go, blah, blah, blah, nothing.

00:36:43.710 --> 00:36:48.450
And I think that's how you get
these visceral experiences.

00:36:48.450 --> 00:36:51.660
They did have a
light blow out once

00:36:51.660 --> 00:36:53.910
when they were about
to start cooking.

00:36:53.910 --> 00:36:57.870
So it took them about five or
six minutes to change the bulb.

00:36:57.870 --> 00:37:00.990
They changed the basket, because
they had had five minutes.

00:37:00.990 --> 00:37:04.800
And I think those types
of truths on the show

00:37:04.800 --> 00:37:06.210
really make it what it is.

00:37:06.210 --> 00:37:08.926
The other thing I want to say
is that, that Bobby Flay, man,

00:37:08.926 --> 00:37:09.800
on "Beat Bobby Flay."

00:37:09.800 --> 00:37:10.620
People are like, oh, my god.

00:37:10.620 --> 00:37:11.828
How does he win all the time?

00:37:11.828 --> 00:37:12.600
It's so fake.

00:37:12.600 --> 00:37:14.070
Please.

00:37:14.070 --> 00:37:16.200
I'm like, how did you win again?

00:37:16.200 --> 00:37:17.710
So annoying.

00:37:17.710 --> 00:37:18.720
But he really does it.

00:37:18.720 --> 00:37:19.060
CHARITY WORRELL: I've
seen him lose, though.

00:37:19.060 --> 00:37:19.350
ALEX GUARNASCHELLI: What?

00:37:19.350 --> 00:37:20.580
CHARITY WORRELL:
I've seen him lose.

00:37:20.580 --> 00:37:21.660
ALEX GUARNASCHELLI:
He loses, yeah.

00:37:21.660 --> 00:37:23.660
I like when he loses
something like tacos.

00:37:23.660 --> 00:37:27.259
I'm like, aren't you supposed
to know how to make that?

00:37:27.259 --> 00:37:28.050
He's like, shut up.

00:37:28.050 --> 00:37:29.584
This is your last episode.

00:37:32.310 --> 00:37:33.630
Those are my-- yeah, sure.

00:37:33.630 --> 00:37:34.386
It's the eating.

00:37:34.386 --> 00:37:35.760
I guess that's
behind the scenes.

00:37:35.760 --> 00:37:36.887
Are you laughing at me?

00:37:36.887 --> 00:37:40.366
You're so cute.

00:37:40.366 --> 00:37:41.360
AUDIENCE: Hi.

00:37:41.360 --> 00:37:43.311
So to begin, the
cavatappi at Butter

00:37:43.311 --> 00:37:45.060
is one of my favorite
things in the world.

00:37:45.060 --> 00:37:46.170
ALEX GUARNASCHELLI:
Oh, thank you.

00:37:46.170 --> 00:37:48.460
AUDIENCE: Thank you for
introducing that into my life.

00:37:48.460 --> 00:37:51.030
So considering the culinary
world is definitely

00:37:51.030 --> 00:37:54.510
a male-dominated industry, as
a prominent woman in the field,

00:37:54.510 --> 00:37:56.910
what advice would you have
for young professional women

00:37:56.910 --> 00:37:58.887
who are considering
starting their careers?

00:37:58.887 --> 00:38:00.220
ALEX GUARNASCHELLI: Is that you?

00:38:00.220 --> 00:38:00.761
AUDIENCE: No.

00:38:00.761 --> 00:38:02.580
It's my sister, though,
my little sister.

00:38:02.580 --> 00:38:04.780
ALEX GUARNASCHELLI: Your sister?

00:38:04.780 --> 00:38:06.030
AUDIENCE: My imaginary friend.

00:38:06.030 --> 00:38:08.550
ALEX GUARNASCHELLI:
I'm just googling you.

00:38:08.550 --> 00:38:09.810
You're an only child.

00:38:09.810 --> 00:38:12.300
No.

00:38:12.300 --> 00:38:13.720
I get this question a lot.

00:38:13.720 --> 00:38:17.730
I mean, I'm going to write
the proper answer in a book,

00:38:17.730 --> 00:38:20.100
but until I do
that, I'll say off

00:38:20.100 --> 00:38:23.610
the cuff, which
I'll regret later,

00:38:23.610 --> 00:38:26.350
probably, I just
always ignored gender.

00:38:26.350 --> 00:38:30.120
And I think that in a
gender-fluid time, where

00:38:30.120 --> 00:38:33.540
I think we're really
questioning gender roles,

00:38:33.540 --> 00:38:36.780
I mean things like referring
to yourself as they,

00:38:36.780 --> 00:38:38.670
instead of he or she.

00:38:38.670 --> 00:38:42.800
I think I mentally referred
to myself as a "we."

00:38:42.800 --> 00:38:46.560
And the we that was all
the little characters

00:38:46.560 --> 00:38:49.290
in my personal play that
gave me the confidence

00:38:49.290 --> 00:38:53.550
to stand in a kitchen with 27
men and cook all those years

00:38:53.550 --> 00:38:57.760
and be bad at it and be
vulnerable and whatever else.

00:38:57.760 --> 00:38:58.840
I just ignored it.

00:38:58.840 --> 00:39:01.425
I just thought, this is
just part of the schoolyard,

00:39:01.425 --> 00:39:02.284
you know?

00:39:05.010 --> 00:39:09.900
I find both genders can
be cruel in their own way.

00:39:09.900 --> 00:39:13.585
I'm sure you would agree,
but I really ignored that.

00:39:13.585 --> 00:39:15.210
I just thought, I
want to be an expert.

00:39:15.210 --> 00:39:18.450
I want to be good at it, and
this is what I have to do.

00:39:18.450 --> 00:39:21.120
And that stuff was
hard sometimes,

00:39:21.120 --> 00:39:25.290
so is learning how to
butcher a side of beef.

00:39:25.290 --> 00:39:27.660
It wasn't just the
people that was hard,

00:39:27.660 --> 00:39:32.680
it was all the work that I had
to master or try to master.

00:39:32.680 --> 00:39:37.500
So ignore it and be as
polite as you possibly can.

00:39:37.500 --> 00:39:40.530
Did you ever see this movie,
"Roadhouse," Patrick Swayze?

00:39:40.530 --> 00:39:41.700
Probably not.

00:39:41.700 --> 00:39:42.950
There's a whole talk in there.

00:39:42.950 --> 00:39:44.070
You know, he's a cooler.

00:39:44.070 --> 00:39:45.960
He's a bouncer in all
these different places.

00:39:45.960 --> 00:39:48.000
I want to hire him to
just fix my life, which

00:39:48.000 --> 00:39:49.410
it's a little late for that.

00:39:49.410 --> 00:39:53.689
But he says, be nice until
it's time not to be nice,

00:39:53.689 --> 00:39:54.980
and he has this whole chitchat.

00:39:54.980 --> 00:39:58.490
Some of you have seen the
movie, I'm sure, or I hope.

00:39:58.490 --> 00:39:59.010
Thank you.

00:39:59.010 --> 00:40:00.470
God bless.

00:40:00.470 --> 00:40:02.210
Thank you, Dad.

00:40:02.210 --> 00:40:06.470
So something like that.

00:40:06.470 --> 00:40:07.340
Keep it inside.

00:40:07.340 --> 00:40:08.330
Keep it moving.

00:40:08.330 --> 00:40:13.470
Stay polite and try to
be the best in the room,

00:40:13.470 --> 00:40:16.280
and then that generally makes
everything else not matter,

00:40:16.280 --> 00:40:19.360
even if you don't
end up the best.

00:40:19.360 --> 00:40:21.490
People respect you for
effort and hard work.

00:40:21.490 --> 00:40:25.394
I don't think anybody can ignore
that, if that makes sense.

00:40:25.394 --> 00:40:27.310
And then sometimes all
that just doesn't work,

00:40:27.310 --> 00:40:29.800
and it just sucks also.

00:40:29.800 --> 00:40:31.530
But ignore.

00:40:31.530 --> 00:40:32.170
Hit Delete.

00:40:32.170 --> 00:40:34.220
Move on.

00:40:34.220 --> 00:40:34.890
Yeah.

00:40:34.890 --> 00:40:35.710
Hi.

00:40:35.710 --> 00:40:38.130
AUDIENCE: I really like
"Chopped" and you as a judge.

00:40:38.130 --> 00:40:38.890
ALEX GUARNASCHELLI: Thanks.

00:40:38.890 --> 00:40:39.550
AUDIENCE: I was
wondering what you

00:40:39.550 --> 00:40:42.670
think is the funniest or most
memorable moment on the show?

00:40:42.670 --> 00:40:44.670
ALEX GUARNASCHELLI: No
one's ever asked me that.

00:40:44.670 --> 00:40:47.440
No one's ever asks
me what's funny?

00:40:47.440 --> 00:40:49.450
I've never been asked that.

00:40:49.450 --> 00:40:50.710
What's funny?

00:40:50.710 --> 00:40:51.310
Not much.

00:40:56.980 --> 00:40:58.540
I mean, the funniest
things to me

00:40:58.540 --> 00:41:02.380
are being on an episode
with Geoffrey and Scott

00:41:02.380 --> 00:41:04.120
on either side of me.

00:41:04.120 --> 00:41:07.420
That is the trifecta,
the three of us.

00:41:07.420 --> 00:41:09.610
We have some special bond.

00:41:09.610 --> 00:41:11.980
I like watching Geoffrey
and Scott bicker over

00:41:11.980 --> 00:41:15.247
who's wearing a nicer suit.

00:41:15.247 --> 00:41:16.330
And they'll keep it going.

00:41:16.330 --> 00:41:18.160
I mean, we sit there
for 10, 12 hours.

00:41:18.160 --> 00:41:21.170
AUDIENCE: Oh, wow

00:41:21.170 --> 00:41:24.650
ALEX GUARNASCHELLI: That's
a lot of thread count talk.

00:41:24.650 --> 00:41:28.430
But the two of them, they make
me laugh the most, really.

00:41:28.430 --> 00:41:29.977
That would have to be it, yeah.

00:41:29.977 --> 00:41:31.060
They're just unbelievable.

00:41:31.060 --> 00:41:32.510
He's like, do you see this?

00:41:32.510 --> 00:41:34.920
And I'm like I just can't,
with your little thing

00:41:34.920 --> 00:41:36.970
and your thing.

00:41:36.970 --> 00:41:38.590
Geoffrey is stratospheric.

00:41:38.590 --> 00:41:39.400
I mean, you know?

00:41:39.400 --> 00:41:41.890
Now, I've got Marcus
Samuelsson as sort

00:41:41.890 --> 00:41:43.940
of like a competing
fashion icon.

00:41:43.940 --> 00:41:45.190
And I'm like Marcus, I think--

00:41:45.190 --> 00:41:46.390
CHARITY WORRELL:
He dresses so well.

00:41:46.390 --> 00:41:47.020
ALEX GUARNASCHELLI:
He really does.

00:41:47.020 --> 00:41:48.700
I'm like, Marcus, I think
you look a little nicer

00:41:48.700 --> 00:41:49.533
than Geoffrey today.

00:41:49.533 --> 00:41:53.200
And Geoffrey is
like, exsqueeze me?

00:41:53.200 --> 00:41:56.860
He's literally like a
peacock, fanning his feathers.

00:41:56.860 --> 00:41:58.720
So I enjoy that.

00:41:58.720 --> 00:42:02.230
With all that vanity is so
much humility and intelligence

00:42:02.230 --> 00:42:03.370
that it's fun.

00:42:03.370 --> 00:42:07.623
But they crack me up
the most, definitely.

00:42:07.623 --> 00:42:10.200
AUDIENCE: So since you
don't get invited out

00:42:10.200 --> 00:42:13.030
to eat ever, if you ever want to
come over here, me and my wife

00:42:13.030 --> 00:42:13.830
will happily have you over.

00:42:13.830 --> 00:42:14.913
Just let me know the time.

00:42:14.913 --> 00:42:16.270
ALEX GUARNASCHELLI: I love it.

00:42:16.270 --> 00:42:19.030
You will be judged silently.

00:42:19.030 --> 00:42:21.340
AUDIENCE: I feel pretty
confident in my skills,

00:42:21.340 --> 00:42:21.840
even though I'm an amateur.

00:42:21.840 --> 00:42:22.250
I feel--

00:42:22.250 --> 00:42:23.520
ALEX GUARNASCHELLI:
I'll take care of that.

00:42:23.520 --> 00:42:24.360
[LAUGHTER]

00:42:27.490 --> 00:42:29.806
Buildings crumbling.

00:42:29.806 --> 00:42:32.180
AUDIENCE: Out of all of the
dishes that you've ever had--

00:42:32.180 --> 00:42:33.346
ALEX GUARNASCHELLI: Oh, god!

00:42:33.346 --> 00:42:35.500
Why are you doing this?

00:42:35.500 --> 00:42:38.450
My therapist said
I can ignore you.

00:42:38.450 --> 00:42:41.290
AUDIENCE: Do you remember
the best one that you've had

00:42:41.290 --> 00:42:41.950
so far?

00:42:41.950 --> 00:42:42.880
ALEX GUARNASCHELLI: On the show?

00:42:42.880 --> 00:42:44.227
AUDIENCE: On "Chopped," yeah.

00:42:44.227 --> 00:42:45.121
ALEX GUARNASCHELLI: The best?

00:42:45.121 --> 00:42:46.079
AUDIENCE: The best one.

00:42:46.079 --> 00:42:48.020
The one that made you really--

00:42:48.020 --> 00:42:50.710
ALEX GUARNASCHELLI:
There's a couple, yeah.

00:42:50.710 --> 00:42:51.707
There's a couple.

00:42:51.707 --> 00:42:53.040
People usually ask me the worst.

00:42:53.040 --> 00:42:55.360
You guys are so sunshiny.

00:42:55.360 --> 00:42:56.610
What's the funniest moment?

00:42:56.610 --> 00:42:57.550
What's your favorite dish?

00:42:57.550 --> 00:42:59.008
People are like,
what's disgusting?

00:42:59.008 --> 00:43:00.035
Tell us.

00:43:00.035 --> 00:43:01.451
CHARITY WORRELL:
I asked you that.

00:43:01.451 --> 00:43:02.909
ALEX GUARNASCHELLI:
Get down to it.

00:43:05.300 --> 00:43:07.120
Yeah, there was a
dish, I literally

00:43:07.120 --> 00:43:08.580
think it's season one.

00:43:08.580 --> 00:43:09.800
It was a dessert.

00:43:09.800 --> 00:43:12.860
And while I don't remember
everything about it,

00:43:12.860 --> 00:43:14.560
the person made a short cake--

00:43:14.560 --> 00:43:16.570
like a cream drop
biscuit, and they

00:43:16.570 --> 00:43:20.440
had to use pickled ginger
and pickled grape leaves.

00:43:20.440 --> 00:43:23.860
The whole basket was like
vinegar or salt bomb.

00:43:23.860 --> 00:43:26.380
And they made
basically a shortcake

00:43:26.380 --> 00:43:27.940
with all these
savory ingredients,

00:43:27.940 --> 00:43:30.710
and it was just perfect.

00:43:30.710 --> 00:43:34.120
And I remember I think
I said to the producer,

00:43:34.120 --> 00:43:36.520
is it OK if I say
this is perfect,

00:43:36.520 --> 00:43:38.020
and that I have no criticism.

00:43:38.020 --> 00:43:43.270
And she said, no, but almost.

00:43:43.270 --> 00:43:47.100
And that dish, yeah,
that's my favorite one.

00:43:47.100 --> 00:43:49.100
I had another one recently
that was pretty good,

00:43:49.100 --> 00:43:52.070
but I can't tell you about it.

00:43:52.070 --> 00:43:56.990
I've also had some really rough
moments like pureed hot dogs

00:43:56.990 --> 00:44:00.210
raw on French toast.

00:44:00.210 --> 00:44:00.860
Yeah.

00:44:00.860 --> 00:44:01.680
AUDIENCE: Sounds delicious.

00:44:01.680 --> 00:44:04.096
ALEX GUARNASCHELLI: Yeah, I'll
be serving it in the lounge

00:44:04.096 --> 00:44:05.410
after.

00:44:05.410 --> 00:44:06.800
So yeah, thank you.

00:44:06.800 --> 00:44:08.459
Great question.

00:44:08.459 --> 00:44:09.000
AUDIENCE: Hi.

00:44:09.000 --> 00:44:09.430
ALEX GUARNASCHELLI: Hi.

00:44:09.430 --> 00:44:11.846
AUDIENCE: I'm curious, what
is your favorite New York City

00:44:11.846 --> 00:44:14.360
grocery store to get lost
in and spend a lot of time.

00:44:14.360 --> 00:44:16.109
ALEX GUARNASCHELLI:
God, these questions--

00:44:16.109 --> 00:44:17.790
you guys are so smart.

00:44:17.790 --> 00:44:19.290
I wasn't ready for this.

00:44:22.071 --> 00:44:22.570
Really?

00:44:22.570 --> 00:44:23.590
My favorite?

00:44:27.310 --> 00:44:30.790
Hm, I love so many.

00:44:30.790 --> 00:44:34.130
I have to be honest,
it's not a grocery store,

00:44:34.130 --> 00:44:35.960
but my favorite
place to get lost,

00:44:35.960 --> 00:44:39.110
hands down, is the Union
Square Greenmarket.

00:44:39.110 --> 00:44:43.070
I start on Park Avenue
and 17th Street,

00:44:43.070 --> 00:44:47.030
and I just curve my way-- it's
basically horseshoe-shaped.

00:44:47.030 --> 00:44:49.040
And I just curve
my way all around.

00:44:49.040 --> 00:44:51.380
That's my favorite
grocery store.

00:44:51.380 --> 00:44:54.320
I know it's not brick and
mortar in the classical sense.

00:44:54.320 --> 00:44:58.770
But I can eat five apple
cider donuts and 14 muffins.

00:44:58.770 --> 00:45:02.260
And people are like, oh, it's
so healthy, the Greenmarket.

00:45:02.260 --> 00:45:04.906
Cucumbers and zucchini,
where's the fun in that?

00:45:04.906 --> 00:45:07.280
Let me tell you again, I'm a
10,000-calorie moment making

00:45:07.280 --> 00:45:10.630
that loop, if you work hard.

00:45:10.630 --> 00:45:14.180
And I really like
keeping abreast

00:45:14.180 --> 00:45:17.324
of what farmers are making
what in the tri-state area.

00:45:17.324 --> 00:45:18.740
I mean, a lot of
it is, obviously,

00:45:18.740 --> 00:45:21.140
New York, some New Jersey.

00:45:21.140 --> 00:45:24.110
I really like keeping up
on what people are making

00:45:24.110 --> 00:45:25.940
and producing, and I buy that.

00:45:25.940 --> 00:45:29.120
And we serve so much
of that at Butter.

00:45:29.120 --> 00:45:30.920
And I don't have
a wall of farmers

00:45:30.920 --> 00:45:34.200
with a picture of a cow, and we
don't have any of that stuff.

00:45:34.200 --> 00:45:35.960
We just buy the
stuff and serve it.

00:45:35.960 --> 00:45:39.290
Because that's, I feel,
as much as a restaurant is

00:45:39.290 --> 00:45:41.060
able to do that
within their means,

00:45:41.060 --> 00:45:43.950
to me, that's what a
restaurant should do.

00:45:43.950 --> 00:45:45.140
So that's my favorite.

00:45:45.140 --> 00:45:46.070
AUDIENCE: Thank you.

00:45:46.070 --> 00:45:47.372
ALEX GUARNASCHELLI: Yeah, sure.

00:45:47.372 --> 00:45:48.830
I wish I had an
even better answer.

00:45:48.830 --> 00:45:50.720
Dammit.

00:45:50.720 --> 00:45:51.220
Yes?

00:45:51.220 --> 00:45:52.310
CHARITY WORRELL: These are
the last three questions.

00:45:52.310 --> 00:45:54.476
AUDIENCE: So this is like
another favorite question.

00:45:54.476 --> 00:45:58.940
ALEX GUARNASCHELLI: Yeah,
God, I'm so stressed out.

00:45:58.940 --> 00:46:01.550
AUDIENCE: Who would
you most prefer

00:46:01.550 --> 00:46:08.374
to have cook you a meal, of
all of the chefs and cooks

00:46:08.374 --> 00:46:09.040
that you've met?

00:46:12.500 --> 00:46:15.830
ALEX GUARNASCHELLI:
Oh, I'm sweating.

00:46:15.830 --> 00:46:18.220
I've got a lot of friends,
but I've got some enemies.

00:46:18.220 --> 00:46:19.345
I've got to-- I've got to--

00:46:22.210 --> 00:46:28.310
probably, I'm in a
wacky head space.

00:46:28.310 --> 00:46:30.050
I'd probably like
Morimoto to cook me

00:46:30.050 --> 00:46:33.640
a giant Japanese
feast or Rick Bayless

00:46:33.640 --> 00:46:35.960
cook me a huge Mexican feast.

00:46:35.960 --> 00:46:37.874
That's kind of where my head is.

00:46:37.874 --> 00:46:39.290
You ask me in two
months, and I'll

00:46:39.290 --> 00:46:44.780
pick someone French and
someone from South America.

00:46:44.780 --> 00:46:47.030
But right now, that
would probably be it.

00:46:47.030 --> 00:46:48.715
I really also want
Anne Sophie-Pic,

00:46:48.715 --> 00:46:49.715
I mentioned her earlier.

00:46:49.715 --> 00:46:51.464
AUDIENCE: You only get
to pick one though.

00:46:51.464 --> 00:46:53.865
ALEX GUARNASCHELLI: Stop it.

00:46:53.865 --> 00:46:55.696
You're the worst.

00:46:55.696 --> 00:46:57.070
AUDIENCE: I mean,
Morimoto works.

00:46:57.070 --> 00:46:57.286
ALEX GUARNASCHELLI:
You're chopped.

00:46:57.286 --> 00:46:57.570
What?

00:46:57.570 --> 00:46:58.880
AUDIENCE: Morimoto
works just fine.

00:46:58.880 --> 00:47:00.379
ALEX GUARNASCHELLI:
Yeah, Morimoto--

00:47:00.379 --> 00:47:02.710
I'm going to go with
Rick Bayless for today.

00:47:02.710 --> 00:47:04.283
I'm moody, though.

00:47:04.283 --> 00:47:05.250
AUDIENCE: Thank you.

00:47:05.250 --> 00:47:06.630
ALEX GUARNASCHELLI: Yeah, yeah.

00:47:06.630 --> 00:47:07.130
Hi.

00:47:07.130 --> 00:47:08.090
AUDIENCE: Hi.

00:47:08.090 --> 00:47:09.110
I love you on "Chopped."

00:47:09.110 --> 00:47:10.070
ALEX GUARNASCHELLI: Thank you.

00:47:10.070 --> 00:47:11.666
Only on "Chopped,"
do you notice that?

00:47:11.666 --> 00:47:13.520
AUDIENCE: That's the
one I watch the most.

00:47:13.520 --> 00:47:15.680
So like I am obsessed
with the Food Network.

00:47:15.680 --> 00:47:17.840
It plays in the back of
my house all the time,

00:47:17.840 --> 00:47:21.020
and I love eating out,
and I love home cooking.

00:47:21.020 --> 00:47:23.840
But basically, I
hate cooking myself,

00:47:23.840 --> 00:47:25.550
because it stresses me out.

00:47:25.550 --> 00:47:27.470
There's too many things
that can go wrong.

00:47:27.470 --> 00:47:29.037
And if I'm trying
to follow a recipe,

00:47:29.037 --> 00:47:30.620
it really stresses
me out, because I'm

00:47:30.620 --> 00:47:33.078
worried that I'm I don't know,
going to overcook something.

00:47:33.078 --> 00:47:34.940
But I would like to be good.

00:47:34.940 --> 00:47:39.370
I would like to cook,
despite hating it right now.

00:47:39.370 --> 00:47:42.290
ALEX GUARNASCHELLI:
Do you want a hug?

00:47:42.290 --> 00:47:43.380
AUDIENCE: How can I--

00:47:43.380 --> 00:47:47.330
do you have suggestions for
starting out home cooking,

00:47:47.330 --> 00:47:49.800
easy things to make
or recipe books?

00:47:49.800 --> 00:47:52.155
I mean, I guess,
you're selling a recipe

00:47:52.155 --> 00:47:55.730
book, things that
are good to start out

00:47:55.730 --> 00:47:57.050
to make it less stressful?

00:47:57.050 --> 00:47:58.300
ALEX GUARNASCHELLI: Oh, honey.

00:48:01.835 --> 00:48:04.210
Is there someone in your family
who's a really good cook.

00:48:04.210 --> 00:48:05.770
AUDIENCE: My dad's
a really good cook.

00:48:05.770 --> 00:48:06.790
ALEX GUARNASCHELLI: Did
he do all the cooking

00:48:06.790 --> 00:48:07.873
while you were growing up?

00:48:07.873 --> 00:48:08.600
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

00:48:08.600 --> 00:48:10.600
ALEX GUARNASCHELLI: So
the kitchen was like his.

00:48:10.600 --> 00:48:13.267
AUDIENCE: Yeah, my
mom can't boil an egg.

00:48:13.267 --> 00:48:14.350
ALEX GUARNASCHELLI: Right.

00:48:14.350 --> 00:48:16.016
I was just getting
the vibe that someone

00:48:16.016 --> 00:48:18.690
was very territorial about
the kitchen you grew up in,

00:48:18.690 --> 00:48:23.050
and that you then, as a result,
enjoyed all this great eating

00:48:23.050 --> 00:48:25.067
but maybe didn't
exactly have the space

00:48:25.067 --> 00:48:26.650
to build some
confidence in your own--

00:48:26.650 --> 00:48:27.350
AUDIENCE: Well, he
wanted us to cook more,

00:48:27.350 --> 00:48:28.520
but I just, I don't know.

00:48:28.520 --> 00:48:30.010
It always seemed stressful.

00:48:30.010 --> 00:48:31.600
Well, his bar was too high.

00:48:31.600 --> 00:48:34.220
It was like, if I cook, it's
not going to be as good as that.

00:48:34.220 --> 00:48:35.080
ALEX GUARNASCHELLI: We
said the same thing.

00:48:35.080 --> 00:48:36.958
You just said it
in a different way.

00:48:36.958 --> 00:48:40.240
[LAUGHTER]

00:48:40.240 --> 00:48:43.180
Very expensive mind
you're talking to.

00:48:43.180 --> 00:48:46.980
My therapist is
living in a yacht,

00:48:46.980 --> 00:48:49.040
and I am retailing
her third pool.

00:48:52.330 --> 00:48:54.640
Your dad's not coming
over to eat your food

00:48:54.640 --> 00:48:56.610
unless you invite him.

00:48:56.610 --> 00:49:00.000
So there's that to
think about, right?

00:49:00.000 --> 00:49:01.901
I would say, start with an egg.

00:49:01.901 --> 00:49:03.444
AUDIENCE: I can boil an egg.

00:49:03.444 --> 00:49:05.110
ALEX GUARNASCHELLI:
You can boil an egg,

00:49:05.110 --> 00:49:07.220
but you can also fry
it, poach it, steam it,

00:49:07.220 --> 00:49:09.250
bake it, roast it, scramble.

00:49:09.250 --> 00:49:10.990
You can do a lot of
stuff with an egg.

00:49:10.990 --> 00:49:12.781
And I think if you take
the one ingredient,

00:49:12.781 --> 00:49:17.200
and you just master all the
things you can do with it,

00:49:17.200 --> 00:49:19.670
it really, it's a great
confidence builder.

00:49:19.670 --> 00:49:22.832
I always say eggs, and they're
really easy to screw up.

00:49:22.832 --> 00:49:24.790
They're really easy to
cook, and they're really

00:49:24.790 --> 00:49:25.990
easy to screw up.

00:49:25.990 --> 00:49:28.230
And so if you can just
fry an egg every day.

00:49:28.230 --> 00:49:31.395
Just heal, honey.

00:49:31.395 --> 00:49:32.770
Eventually, you'll
say, I'm going

00:49:32.770 --> 00:49:36.550
to put these eggs into
a cake and a souffle

00:49:36.550 --> 00:49:38.500
and a meatball and a meatloaf.

00:49:38.500 --> 00:49:40.225
And then all of a
sudden, you're cooking.

00:49:40.225 --> 00:49:42.100
And then you invite your
dad over for dinner,

00:49:42.100 --> 00:49:44.320
and you're like, excuse me.

00:49:44.320 --> 00:49:45.550
This is my house.

00:49:48.119 --> 00:49:49.952
CHARITY WORRELL: And
then the last question.

00:49:49.952 --> 00:49:50.340
AUDIENCE: Hi.

00:49:50.340 --> 00:49:52.298
I watch "Chopped" all
the time, and sometimes I

00:49:52.298 --> 00:49:55.920
wonder if, as judges, you
play good cop/bad cop.

00:49:55.920 --> 00:49:58.910
It flows so much, your
comments where, someone

00:49:58.910 --> 00:50:01.410
might slam someone, but then
someone else jumps in and says,

00:50:01.410 --> 00:50:01.909
what?

00:50:01.909 --> 00:50:03.894
This is this.

00:50:03.894 --> 00:50:05.810
Are you aware of that,
or do you feel bad ever

00:50:05.810 --> 00:50:07.530
if all three of you just--

00:50:07.530 --> 00:50:09.670
ALEX GUARNASCHELLI: No.

00:50:09.670 --> 00:50:11.710
No to all of that.

00:50:11.710 --> 00:50:12.820
I know what you mean.

00:50:12.820 --> 00:50:16.810
And some days I'm like,
you were so awful today.

00:50:16.810 --> 00:50:19.960
And then some days, I'm like,
you're such a cream puff.

00:50:19.960 --> 00:50:21.566
But we don't do that on purpose.

00:50:21.566 --> 00:50:24.190
And we don't ever say, OK, dude,
you do this, and I'll do that.

00:50:24.190 --> 00:50:26.530
OK, you take this,
and I'll take that.

00:50:26.530 --> 00:50:30.400
It just flows, and
that's the good fortune

00:50:30.400 --> 00:50:33.430
of fantastic accidental
relationships between all

00:50:33.430 --> 00:50:34.870
the "Chopped" judges.

00:50:34.870 --> 00:50:38.500
And I find like,
I'll say I disagree,

00:50:38.500 --> 00:50:40.850
and Geoffrey's like, of
course, you disagree with me.

00:50:40.850 --> 00:50:42.740
So he feels like I
always disagree with him,

00:50:42.740 --> 00:50:45.430
which I pretty much do.

00:50:45.430 --> 00:50:47.800
But no, that's all
organic, that stuff.

00:50:47.800 --> 00:50:51.160
Yes, I feel bad sometimes.

00:50:51.160 --> 00:50:54.400
I feel angry when someone
doesn't do well that's great

00:50:54.400 --> 00:50:57.820
and that doesn't
get portrayed right

00:50:57.820 --> 00:51:02.170
when it gets twisted
through the lens of a TV.

00:51:02.170 --> 00:51:04.300
Or sometimes I'm very
transparent with somebody,

00:51:04.300 --> 00:51:05.920
and people write
me, you're so mean.

00:51:05.920 --> 00:51:08.250
I hate you.

00:51:08.250 --> 00:51:08.750
[SIGHS]

00:51:08.750 --> 00:51:11.510
So when I got my first
hate mail, I called my dad.

00:51:11.510 --> 00:51:13.742
I was like, nobody likes me.

00:51:13.742 --> 00:51:15.650
I'm clutching a can
of paint thinner.

00:51:15.650 --> 00:51:17.296
I'm like, everybody hates me.

00:51:17.296 --> 00:51:19.670
And my dad's like, I think
you're starting to really make

00:51:19.670 --> 00:51:21.530
it if someone doesn't like you.

00:51:21.530 --> 00:51:22.760
That was very helpful.

00:51:22.760 --> 00:51:23.522
Yeah, yeah.

00:51:23.522 --> 00:51:24.980
And then I'd call
my mom, and she's

00:51:24.980 --> 00:51:26.104
like, don't do those shows.

00:51:26.104 --> 00:51:28.770
You're really bad at them.

00:51:28.770 --> 00:51:29.750
So I've got to a lot--

00:51:29.750 --> 00:51:32.960
I have a lot to work out.

00:51:32.960 --> 00:51:34.789
But all that's
just organic, and I
