00:00:00.330 --> 00:00:02.550
&gt;&gt; Monica Valentine: Good
afternoon and welcome.

00:00:02.550 --> 00:00:04.410
My name is Monica
Valentine and I work

00:00:04.410 --> 00:00:06.190
at the Library of Congress.

00:00:06.190 --> 00:00:07.490
All day here at the Library

00:00:07.490 --> 00:00:09.930
of Congress National Book
Festival we are recognizing

00:00:09.930 --> 00:00:12.440
and celebrating the
importance of reading

00:00:12.440 --> 00:00:14.750
and authors and books.

00:00:14.750 --> 00:00:18.010
The Library of Congress makes it
seem easy to do this every year,

00:00:18.010 --> 00:00:20.360
but the truth is, the
National Book Festival is a

00:00:20.360 --> 00:00:22.300
huge undertaking.

00:00:22.300 --> 00:00:25.370
It's a huge financial
undertaking and it is free

00:00:25.370 --> 00:00:27.900
for everyone, because
of the generous support

00:00:27.900 --> 00:00:30.330
from our sponsors
and supporters.

00:00:30.330 --> 00:00:32.710
Spread the joy of reading
with your gift online

00:00:32.710 --> 00:00:36.300

or when you purchase
books today.

00:00:38.290 --> 00:00:41.540
Now, on to the main event.

00:00:41.540 --> 00:00:43.580
Erin Entrada Kelly is the author

00:00:43.580 --> 00:00:45.820
of four critically
acclaimed books for

00:00:45.820 --> 00:00:49.390
and about young people
including "Blackbird Fly",

00:00:49.390 --> 00:00:50.910
"The Land of Forgotten Girls",

00:00:50.910 --> 00:00:53.440
and her latest hit,
"You go First."

00:00:53.440 --> 00:00:55.680
Please don't forget to
visit the book sales area

00:00:55.680 --> 00:00:57.860
where her books are
available today.

00:00:57.860 --> 00:01:01.270
This year, Erin was awarded the
prestigious John Newbery Medal

00:01:01.270 --> 00:01:03.380
for her book, "Hello, Universe",

00:01:03.380 --> 00:01:06.410
the story of four middle
schoolers whose lives intersect

00:01:06.410 --> 00:01:08.030
in an interesting way.

00:01:08.030 --> 00:01:09.330
I'm thrilled to introduce

00:01:09.330 --> 00:01:12.780
and congratulate the 2018
Newbery Medal winner,

00:01:12.780 --> 00:01:16.510
please welcome Erin
Entrada Kelly.

00:01:16.510 --> 00:01:22.500
[ Applause ]

00:01:24.150 --> 00:01:26.340
&gt;&gt; Erin Entrada Kelly:
Thank you.

00:01:26.340 --> 00:01:28.380
So, I'm going to talk for a
little bit and then I'm going

00:01:28.380 --> 00:01:32.010
to take questions at the end,
so I hope you have questions.

00:01:32.010 --> 00:01:33.900
You look super inquisitive.

00:01:33.900 --> 00:01:37.050
So, I'm assuming
you do; no pressure.

00:01:37.050 --> 00:01:41.220
So, one of the most
common questions

00:01:41.220 --> 00:01:44.930
that I get is why
do you write books

00:01:44.930 --> 00:01:47.470
and was in your inspiration?

00:01:47.470 --> 00:01:49.730
So, I've answered
this in a variety

00:01:49.730 --> 00:01:51.590
of different ways
that's pretty similar,

00:01:51.590 --> 00:01:55.130
but to kind of give you an
idea of the answer to both

00:01:55.130 --> 00:01:57.180
of those questions,
I'm going to ask you

00:01:57.180 --> 00:01:59.310
to use your imaginations.

00:01:59.310 --> 00:02:01.360
Does anyone here
like to daydream

00:02:01.360 --> 00:02:03.140
or use their imaginations a lot?

00:02:03.140 --> 00:02:05.570
Me too. Okay, so we're
going to turn it on, right?

00:02:05.570 --> 00:02:09.400
And I want you to
imagine, okay and I'm going

00:02:09.400 --> 00:02:11.180
to paint you a picture
because I write books

00:02:11.180 --> 00:02:12.890
so I tell stories, right?

00:02:12.890 --> 00:02:15.170
I want you to picture a girl.

00:02:15.170 --> 00:02:18.120
She's twelve years
old, okay got it?

00:02:18.120 --> 00:02:23.960
Twelve-year-old girl and
she looks a lot different

00:02:23.960 --> 00:02:26.660
from her peers at school, okay.

00:02:26.660 --> 00:02:28.800
Whatever you want
that to look like.

00:02:28.800 --> 00:02:32.020
And let's say that she has,

00:02:32.020 --> 00:02:33.390
well I'll give you a little
hint what she looks like,

00:02:33.390 --> 00:02:35.690
she has very dark hair, okay.

00:02:35.690 --> 00:02:38.870
And the other girls in
her school they have perms

00:02:38.870 --> 00:02:40.390
like the ones that
make your hair curly,

00:02:40.390 --> 00:02:42.600
because this is the
style at her school.

00:02:42.600 --> 00:02:46.000
This may have been in the 80s.

00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:47.530
Just a spoiler alert.

00:02:47.530 --> 00:02:50.140
So, anyway the other girls
in her school all have

00:02:50.140 --> 00:02:54.110
like light hair and perms
and she really wants to look

00:02:54.110 --> 00:02:56.200
like them and they
have blue eyes

00:02:56.200 --> 00:02:57.850
and she doesn't have
any of those things.

00:02:57.850 --> 00:03:01.820
So, what she has done is this
girl that we're picturing

00:03:01.820 --> 00:03:05.340
in our heads she has put
some spray in her hair

00:03:05.340 --> 00:03:08.640
to make her hair kind
of blonder, okay.

00:03:08.640 --> 00:03:09.940
It's called Sun-In.

00:03:09.940 --> 00:03:11.760
I don't know if any of you
are familiar with Sun-In,

00:03:11.760 --> 00:03:13.100
but you spray it in your hair

00:03:13.100 --> 00:03:14.620
and it makes your
hair lighter, okay.

00:03:14.620 --> 00:03:18.360
So, she's kind of got
like these blonde streaks

00:03:18.360 --> 00:03:19.660
in her hair, okay.

00:03:19.660 --> 00:03:22.620
And another thing she
did is she got a perm,

00:03:22.620 --> 00:03:24.680
because that's what the other
girls were doing and she wanted

00:03:24.680 --> 00:03:27.380
to be pretty like the other
girls, but the perm didn't;

00:03:27.380 --> 00:03:30.450
I have to tell you the perm
did not come out that great.

00:03:30.450 --> 00:03:36.540
So, picture with a very
bad perm kind of like hair

00:03:36.540 --> 00:03:38.110
like everywhere, okay.

00:03:38.110 --> 00:03:39.410
It does it on [inaudible].

00:03:39.410 --> 00:03:41.890
So, now we're going
to give her a setting,

00:03:41.890 --> 00:03:43.860
so that's our character
and she's also

00:03:43.860 --> 00:03:46.680
by the way very quiet, right.

00:03:46.680 --> 00:03:49.470
She's a daydreamer
like a lot of you.

00:03:49.470 --> 00:03:52.980
And she's not very outgoing.

00:03:52.980 --> 00:03:55.520
She has like one best friend.

00:03:55.520 --> 00:03:58.790
You know, how some people have;
how many of you in here have

00:03:58.790 --> 00:04:01.220
like a whole bunch
of best friends?

00:04:01.220 --> 00:04:04.760
And how many of you just have
like one or two best friends?

00:04:04.760 --> 00:04:06.220
Right? Okay.

00:04:06.220 --> 00:04:07.970
That's the kind of
kid that she is.

00:04:07.970 --> 00:04:09.270
She just has one best friend

00:04:09.270 --> 00:04:11.630
and your best friend's
name is Nichole.

00:04:11.630 --> 00:04:15.800
So, the problem with having
best friend when twelve

00:04:15.800 --> 00:04:17.220
and in middle school, is

00:04:17.220 --> 00:04:19.570
that sometimes your best
friend is not in your class

00:04:19.570 --> 00:04:24.010
and that is the case
in her gym class.

00:04:24.010 --> 00:04:26.820
So, our setting is
going to be gym class.

00:04:26.820 --> 00:04:29.400
Who loves gym class?

00:04:29.400 --> 00:04:30.700
A few people.

00:04:30.700 --> 00:04:33.900
Okay, of the adults, how
many of you loved gym class?

00:04:33.900 --> 00:04:35.570
You're like this is the best.

00:04:35.570 --> 00:04:40.000
Okay, so as I suspected,
the majority

00:04:40.000 --> 00:04:42.060
of the people do not
enjoy gym class, okay.

00:04:42.060 --> 00:04:43.940
Some of you do, probably
people who know how

00:04:43.940 --> 00:04:46.440
to like actually play
sports and stuff.

00:04:46.440 --> 00:04:47.740
But our character,

00:04:47.740 --> 00:04:51.570
our twelve-year-old girl she's
terrible at all sports, okay,

00:04:51.570 --> 00:04:53.710
that's another thing
you need to know.

00:04:53.710 --> 00:04:56.340
When I say she's
terrible at all sports,

00:04:56.340 --> 00:05:00.450
I mean like when there's a ball
coming toward her face she ducks

00:05:00.450 --> 00:05:03.280
as if her life depends
on it, okay.

00:05:03.280 --> 00:05:05.100
Also, she can't throw.

00:05:05.100 --> 00:05:07.430
So she throws something it
lands like two feet away

00:05:07.430 --> 00:05:09.940
and it's sputters away, okay.

00:05:09.940 --> 00:05:12.650
So, this is our girl
and she's in gym class.

00:05:12.650 --> 00:05:16.900
Now, something terrible
is about to happen okay.

00:05:16.900 --> 00:05:19.220
We're going to do some
more scene setting here.

00:05:19.220 --> 00:05:21.310
You want to know the terrible
things that's about to happen

00:05:21.310 --> 00:05:23.680
to our twelve-year-old girl?

00:05:23.680 --> 00:05:29.390
The coach, Coach Reed is her
name, she says, "We're going

00:05:29.390 --> 00:05:31.580
to play basketball today."

00:05:31.580 --> 00:05:33.240
Okay, that's the bad
thing number one,

00:05:33.240 --> 00:05:36.890
because by the way she's
terrible at basketball, running

00:05:36.890 --> 00:05:41.010
and dribbling she doesn't
understand how that's possible

00:05:41.010 --> 00:05:42.810
at the same time.

00:05:42.810 --> 00:05:49.270
So, then the coach says, "I'm
going to choose two captains

00:05:49.270 --> 00:05:52.670
and the captains are going to
choose sides for basketball."

00:05:52.670 --> 00:05:54.910
Have any of you ever had that
happen to you in gym class,

00:05:54.910 --> 00:05:57.520
the grownups and kids where
you have to choose sides?

00:05:57.520 --> 00:05:58.980
You know what I'm talking about.

00:05:58.980 --> 00:06:01.880
So, you're like the captain
and you say, "I want Sally."

00:06:01.880 --> 00:06:04.550
"I want Joe", you
know how it goes.

00:06:04.550 --> 00:06:06.990
So, when the coach
announces this,

00:06:06.990 --> 00:06:10.570
our girl her heart
starts beating really,

00:06:10.570 --> 00:06:12.930
really hard, okay.

00:06:12.930 --> 00:06:19.070
Now, I have to tell you, she
makes a wish at that moment

00:06:19.070 --> 00:06:22.430
and it's not a very nice wish,
because I have to tell you

00:06:22.430 --> 00:06:26.850
that real people in books
just as real people in life,

00:06:26.850 --> 00:06:30.520
you don't always have nice
sunny thoughts, right?

00:06:30.520 --> 00:06:34.480
Because no one in here thinks my
thoughts all the time correct?

00:06:34.480 --> 00:06:38.470
So, this girl has not
a very nice thought

00:06:38.470 --> 00:06:41.000
and this is her not
a very nice thought.

00:06:41.000 --> 00:06:47.460
Her thought is, "I hope
Jessica is picked last."

00:06:47.460 --> 00:06:49.770
Now, who you're wondering
who's Jessica.

00:06:49.770 --> 00:06:51.100
I'll tell you.

00:06:51.100 --> 00:06:56.240
Every time in gym class when
the team captains choose sides,

00:06:56.240 --> 00:07:01.200
there's always two girls who are
picked last or second to last.

00:07:01.200 --> 00:07:04.640
One of them is our
twelve-year-old girl

00:07:04.640 --> 00:07:07.110
and the other one is
a girl named Jessica.

00:07:07.110 --> 00:07:09.670
Jessica is a perfectly
nice girl.

00:07:09.670 --> 00:07:11.740
She's very, very shy.

00:07:11.740 --> 00:07:13.190
She doesn't have many friends.

00:07:13.190 --> 00:07:16.400
So, it's either going to be
our character or it's going

00:07:16.400 --> 00:07:19.510
to be Jessica, right,
one of them is going

00:07:19.510 --> 00:07:22.670
to be picked last, right.

00:07:22.670 --> 00:07:29.480
And our girl character is hoping
with every ounce of her soul

00:07:29.480 --> 00:07:32.580
that it is Jessica
and not her, right.

00:07:32.580 --> 00:07:34.840
So, that's not a very
nice thought, correct?

00:07:34.840 --> 00:07:37.530
Because that means Jessica
has to be picked last

00:07:37.530 --> 00:07:40.500
and that she doesn't, she
doesn't have to be picked last,

00:07:40.500 --> 00:07:44.150
but then it's Jessica
who has to deal with it.

00:07:44.150 --> 00:07:46.370
So, the captains start
calling out names

00:07:46.370 --> 00:07:48.560
and our girl is standing
there you guys.

00:07:48.560 --> 00:07:51.560
And she's trying to act like she
doesn't really care, you know,

00:07:51.560 --> 00:07:52.860
you've done that before
where you try to act

00:07:52.860 --> 00:07:55.200
like you don't care about
something, but you do.

00:07:55.200 --> 00:07:56.940
So, she's trying
to act very casual

00:07:56.940 --> 00:07:58.930
because she's know
what's coming.

00:07:58.930 --> 00:08:02.570
And she hears one name after
the other, after the other.

00:08:02.570 --> 00:08:04.820
Now, her best friend
Nichole, you remember Nichole,

00:08:04.820 --> 00:08:08.130
she's not in gym class with
her, because the best thing

00:08:08.130 --> 00:08:11.650
that can happen when this,
this scene happens is

00:08:11.650 --> 00:08:14.040
that you could be chosen
the captain, then you get

00:08:14.040 --> 00:08:16.220
to choose the names, right?

00:08:16.220 --> 00:08:17.800
The second best thing
that can happen is

00:08:17.800 --> 00:08:20.650
that your best friend is the
team captain, because you know

00:08:20.650 --> 00:08:22.070
that your best friend
doesn't care

00:08:22.070 --> 00:08:23.490
that you're terrible
at basketball.

00:08:23.490 --> 00:08:26.460
She's not going to let
you be picked last.

00:08:26.460 --> 00:08:28.600
So, neither of those
things have happened.

00:08:28.600 --> 00:08:32.610
So, she's standing there and
her heart's beating, okay,

00:08:32.610 --> 00:08:36.660
names are called, names are
called and guess what happens,

00:08:36.660 --> 00:08:39.290
she's picked last again.

00:08:39.290 --> 00:08:43.680
And now she has to go out on the
basketball court and play a game

00:08:43.680 --> 00:08:45.850
that she's already
terrible at and pretend

00:08:45.850 --> 00:08:49.810
like she doesn't care when
all she can think about is.

00:08:49.810 --> 00:08:55.040
"I was picked last and
everyone knows it", right?

00:08:55.040 --> 00:08:59.470
Now, you're probably wondering
how this answers the question.

00:08:59.470 --> 00:09:04.050
And the question was, if you
remember, "Why do I write books

00:09:04.050 --> 00:09:06.690
and why do I write
for young people?"

00:09:06.690 --> 00:09:08.970
The answer to the second
one is I'm going to let you

00:09:08.970 --> 00:09:11.570
in on a secret; I don't
really like grownups.

00:09:11.570 --> 00:09:13.460
No offense.

00:09:13.460 --> 00:09:18.400
Kids are much more
interesting to me.

00:09:18.400 --> 00:09:22.250
Grownups can be a little
boring sometimes except for me.

00:09:22.250 --> 00:09:23.690
I'm fascinating.

00:09:23.690 --> 00:09:31.590
So, the main reason though
is when I was a kid, okay,

00:09:31.590 --> 00:09:37.660
here's another secret, I was
very lonely, self-conscious.

00:09:37.660 --> 00:09:41.520
I always second-guessed myself
all of the time and the thing

00:09:41.520 --> 00:09:43.860
that grownups sometimes
forget about being a kid is,

00:09:43.860 --> 00:09:45.270
while you're going
through all this,

00:09:45.270 --> 00:09:47.230
while you're being picked
last for basketball,

00:09:47.230 --> 00:09:49.260
why you're sitting
alone at lunch,

00:09:49.260 --> 00:09:50.590
while you're being left out,

00:09:50.590 --> 00:09:51.890
while you're best
friend is talking

00:09:51.890 --> 00:09:54.230
about you behind your
back, while the person

00:09:54.230 --> 00:09:55.690
who likes you doesn't like you

00:09:55.690 --> 00:09:57.670
and says something mean all
these terrible things are

00:09:57.670 --> 00:10:01.060
happening to you, a lot of
times you feel like you have

00:10:01.060 --> 00:10:03.760
to act like you don't care.

00:10:03.760 --> 00:10:07.240
It doesn't bother you,
because you want to be, right,

00:10:07.240 --> 00:10:12.780
you don't want to be the;
you want to feel like you're

00:10:12.780 --> 00:10:15.730
in control of things
that are happening to you

00:10:15.730 --> 00:10:19.060
and that things are just
rolling off your back, right?

00:10:19.060 --> 00:10:24.060
You want to put on a strong
exterior and the problem

00:10:24.060 --> 00:10:25.700
with that is a lot of
times we're putting

00:10:25.700 --> 00:10:29.130
on a strong exterior, but
inside our hearts are breaking.

00:10:29.130 --> 00:10:33.040
Not all the time and some more
than others, so what I want

00:10:33.040 --> 00:10:36.840
from my books is for
the amount of time

00:10:36.840 --> 00:10:40.630
that young people are
reading, that they feel

00:10:40.630 --> 00:10:43.890
like they're not alone anymore.

00:10:43.890 --> 00:10:45.190
Because the thing is,

00:10:45.190 --> 00:10:47.020
when you're the twelve-year-old
standing in the gym class,

00:10:47.020 --> 00:10:48.790
or the kid sitting
alone at lunch,

00:10:48.790 --> 00:10:52.040
or the person being made fun
of, or the person who's weird

00:10:52.040 --> 00:10:55.250
or being laughed at, okay,
when you're that person,

00:10:55.250 --> 00:10:58.680
you can be in a room full of
people and still feel all alone

00:10:58.680 --> 00:11:01.350
and like you're the
only person in universe.

00:11:01.350 --> 00:11:04.590
So, in my books one common
theme that's in all my books is

00:11:04.590 --> 00:11:08.760
that that's how the kids feel
and it's not a good way to feel,

00:11:08.760 --> 00:11:11.740
but it's inevitable, right,
we know what inevitable means.

00:11:11.740 --> 00:11:14.510
It's going to happen to
all of us at some point.

00:11:14.510 --> 00:11:17.630
So, my hope is that books,
by the way, have you figured

00:11:17.630 --> 00:11:18.930
out the twelve-year-old is me?

00:11:18.930 --> 00:11:20.230
I didn't reveal that.

00:11:20.230 --> 00:11:21.620
You saw that twist coming.

00:11:21.620 --> 00:11:22.930
You knew it was coming.

00:11:22.930 --> 00:11:25.360
Okay. That really
wasn't a twist was it?

00:11:25.360 --> 00:11:26.660
You knew from the
beginning, okay.

00:11:26.660 --> 00:11:33.970
I want kids to know that they're
not alone and I want you,

00:11:33.970 --> 00:11:37.770
when you read my books,
to connect with the kids

00:11:37.770 --> 00:11:40.390
that I write about, because
there's a piece of me

00:11:40.390 --> 00:11:43.160
in all the kids except
the mean kids.

00:11:43.160 --> 00:11:46.630
Those are based off
people I don't like.

00:11:46.630 --> 00:11:49.060
Just kidding a little bit.

00:11:49.060 --> 00:11:53.340
So, that's kind of my spiel
and one thing that's common

00:11:53.340 --> 00:11:55.210
in all my books is
that it has characters

00:11:55.210 --> 00:11:57.950
who are called "misfits."

00:11:57.950 --> 00:12:00.420
They're called misfits a
lot; kids who don't quite fit

00:12:00.420 --> 00:12:02.980
in who are trying to find their
place in the world which is kind

00:12:02.980 --> 00:12:05.800
of all kids and all people.

00:12:05.800 --> 00:12:11.440
And the idea that you
can be quiet, but mighty,

00:12:11.440 --> 00:12:14.390
that you can be strong in
a lot of different ways

00:12:14.390 --> 00:12:18.780
and that you don't have to be
the best student, the prettiest,

00:12:18.780 --> 00:12:21.810
the most handsome, the most
athletic, the cleverest.

00:12:21.810 --> 00:12:26.520
All you have to be is the best
version of yourself, right?

00:12:26.520 --> 00:12:30.640
And that's the message that I
want my books to give to you.

00:12:30.640 --> 00:12:34.570
So, all that being said,
guess what happens now?

00:12:34.570 --> 00:12:36.740
You're bursting with
questions I can tell.

00:12:36.740 --> 00:12:38.080
See, I feel like
if I say that ahead

00:12:38.080 --> 00:12:40.320
of time everyone will
ask questions, right?

00:12:40.320 --> 00:12:42.260
Because you don't want me to
be embarrassed, you just heard

00:12:42.260 --> 00:12:44.130
that sad story, right?

00:12:44.130 --> 00:12:46.540
Okay, so I will take
questions from people

00:12:46.540 --> 00:12:50.390
of all ages unless you're
thirty-two then I don't

00:12:50.390 --> 00:12:52.240
take them.

00:12:52.240 --> 00:12:53.580
Just kidding.

00:12:53.580 --> 00:12:55.750
Okay, are we ready?

00:12:55.750 --> 00:12:57.400
Questions.

00:12:57.400 --> 00:12:59.200
Yes.

00:12:59.200 --> 00:13:01.740
[ Inaudible Question ]

00:13:01.740 --> 00:13:03.040
That I ever wrote?

00:13:03.040 --> 00:13:04.340
&gt;&gt; Yes.

00:13:04.340 --> 00:13:06.330
&gt;&gt; Erin Entrada Kelly:
Or that I ever read?

00:13:06.330 --> 00:13:11.280
Okay. My favorite
book that ever wrote?

00:13:11.280 --> 00:13:13.720
I have to tell you I was just
having this conversation earlier

00:13:13.720 --> 00:13:16.700
and a lot of authors, if
you've seen other authors a lot

00:13:16.700 --> 00:13:18.770
of times they say, "I
don't have a favorite.

00:13:18.770 --> 00:13:20.070
I love all my books.

00:13:20.070 --> 00:13:21.370
They're like my children."

00:13:21.370 --> 00:13:23.660
You know, and they are,
but I do have a favorite.

00:13:23.660 --> 00:13:26.240
It's my second book
and the title is

00:13:26.240 --> 00:13:27.990
"The Land of Forgotten Girls."

00:13:27.990 --> 00:13:30.450
That's my favorite
book that I wrote.

00:13:30.450 --> 00:13:31.910
And the reason is because it's

00:13:31.910 --> 00:13:34.010
about two sisters,
I have a sister.

00:13:34.010 --> 00:13:37.270
Does anyone have a
sibling, siblings, yeah.

00:13:37.270 --> 00:13:38.880
Aren't they fun?

00:13:38.880 --> 00:13:41.810
Yeah, the people, the kids in
the front they're like "no."

00:13:41.810 --> 00:13:45.840
It's about two sisters
who use their imaginations

00:13:45.840 --> 00:13:48.310
to overcome their circumstances,

00:13:48.310 --> 00:13:49.780
but I do love all
the books I've wrote,

00:13:49.780 --> 00:13:51.080
but that one is my favorite.

00:13:51.080 --> 00:13:52.380
I have an older sister.

00:13:52.380 --> 00:13:53.680
She's okay.

00:13:53.680 --> 00:13:54.980
Yes, question.

00:13:54.980 --> 00:13:57.370
Oh! Oh there's a mic okay good.

00:13:57.370 --> 00:14:00.700
&gt;&gt; Are your character's
personalities based

00:14:00.700 --> 00:14:02.060
on anybody that you've met?

00:14:02.060 --> 00:14:03.360
&gt;&gt; Erin Entrada Kelly: Yes.

00:14:03.360 --> 00:14:09.240
A lot of times my characters are
based off; there's a piece of me

00:14:09.240 --> 00:14:12.160
in a lot of my characters
and also the kind of person

00:14:12.160 --> 00:14:15.810
that I want to be and different
qualities from people I've met.

00:14:15.810 --> 00:14:17.110
Yes, good question.

00:14:17.110 --> 00:14:18.910
Thank you.

00:14:18.910 --> 00:14:20.310
Oh.

00:14:20.310 --> 00:14:24.350
&gt;&gt; Why did you make all your
characters kind of misfity

00:14:24.350 --> 00:14:28.850
as opposed to like,
like the average people?

00:14:28.850 --> 00:14:30.290
&gt;&gt; Erin Entrada Kelly: Oh,
that's a great question.

00:14:30.290 --> 00:14:35.040
I have a soft spot
for underdogs.

00:14:35.040 --> 00:14:37.470
We know what underdogs
are right?

00:14:37.470 --> 00:14:42.430
Underdogs are the kids
who are underestimated,

00:14:42.430 --> 00:14:43.730
who don't know their strengths

00:14:43.730 --> 00:14:46.560
and other people don't know
their strengths either.

00:14:46.560 --> 00:14:51.170
I have a special place in
heart for people who go

00:14:51.170 --> 00:14:55.200
against the grain and it's very,

00:14:55.200 --> 00:14:58.180
very hard to be yourself
especially when you're young,

00:14:58.180 --> 00:15:00.180
because you want to fit in
but then everyone's like,

00:15:00.180 --> 00:15:02.880
all the grownups are
like "Just be yourself."

00:15:02.880 --> 00:15:05.240
But then when you be yourself
other people are saying,

00:15:05.240 --> 00:15:07.740
"Oh you're weird" or oh
you're this, oh you're that.

00:15:07.740 --> 00:15:10.290
And so then you try to fit in
and you're not being yourself.

00:15:10.290 --> 00:15:14.360
Anyway, it takes a lot of
bravery to be a misfit.

00:15:14.360 --> 00:15:17.720
So, I have a soft
spot for misfits.

00:15:17.720 --> 00:15:19.020
Great question.

00:15:19.020 --> 00:15:20.560
Thank you.

00:15:20.560 --> 00:15:29.300
&gt;&gt; How long did it take you
to write "Hello, Universe"?

00:15:29.300 --> 00:15:31.210
&gt;&gt; Erin Entrada Kelly: It
took, all my books take

00:15:31.210 --> 00:15:32.850
about a year to write.

00:15:32.850 --> 00:15:36.000
So, with "Hello, Universe" I
had to do a lot of research.

00:15:36.000 --> 00:15:38.220
So, I spent about six months
doing research and then

00:15:38.220 --> 00:15:41.940
about six months writing and
then it takes another year

00:15:41.940 --> 00:15:43.990
because you have to send
your book to your editor

00:15:43.990 --> 00:15:48.180
and make revisions and they
have to do cover art, so a year

00:15:48.180 --> 00:15:52.070
and then another year to
polish it off and get it ready.

00:15:52.070 --> 00:15:56.220
&gt;&gt; How did you figure
out you won the Newbery

00:15:56.220 --> 00:15:57.830
and how did you celebrate?

00:15:57.830 --> 00:15:59.940
&gt;&gt; Erin Entrada Kelly:
Oh, How did I find

00:15:59.940 --> 00:16:01.240
out I won the Newbery?

00:16:01.240 --> 00:16:03.860
So, I have to tell you that what
happens is the Newbery Committee

00:16:03.860 --> 00:16:06.760
for those of you who don't know,
they call you usually very early

00:16:06.760 --> 00:16:09.370
in the morning, the day that
they announce the winners,

00:16:09.370 --> 00:16:11.480
but they did not have
my correct phone number.

00:16:11.480 --> 00:16:13.700
I think they had an old number.

00:16:13.700 --> 00:16:17.060
So, I woke up and I thought,
you know, I didn't expect

00:16:17.060 --> 00:16:18.500
to win anyway honestly.

00:16:18.500 --> 00:16:19.920
So, I was like oh
I wonder who won?

00:16:19.920 --> 00:16:21.990
And I'm driving to
work and I have

00:16:21.990 --> 00:16:23.520
to act it out, I don't know why.

00:16:23.520 --> 00:16:27.260
This is me driving
and the phone rings

00:16:27.260 --> 00:16:31.540
and it's the Newbery Committee
and they tell me that I won

00:16:31.540 --> 00:16:34.290
and I'm on my way to work and
they say, "You know you won."

00:16:34.290 --> 00:16:35.590
And I said, "What?"

00:16:35.590 --> 00:16:37.740
And then there's a big
long pause, it's on YouTube

00:16:37.740 --> 00:16:39.970
because there's a
big quite pause

00:16:39.970 --> 00:16:42.400
and then I ask like
what happened?

00:16:42.400 --> 00:16:48.280
And they repeated it and I hung
up the phone and I called my job

00:16:48.280 --> 00:16:50.990
and I said, "I'm not coming
in for the rest of the week."

00:16:50.990 --> 00:16:53.700
And then, because
there's no way, right?

00:16:53.700 --> 00:16:55.550
I mean, first of all I doubt
I would be able to concentrate

00:16:55.550 --> 00:16:56.970
and then you have
all these interviews.

00:16:56.970 --> 00:16:59.130
And then guess what
happens after that?

00:16:59.130 --> 00:17:01.400
Like maybe this kind
of answers the question

00:17:01.400 --> 00:17:05.090
of how I celebrated, like the
following week I went back

00:17:05.090 --> 00:17:08.930
to work and I was like, "By the
way, do you remember last week

00:17:08.930 --> 00:17:11.050
when I said I wasn't coming
in for the rest of the week?

00:17:11.050 --> 00:17:13.130
Well, now I'm not
coming back ever."

00:17:13.130 --> 00:17:17.270
Because I was able
to quit my job.

00:17:17.270 --> 00:17:18.570
Yeah.

00:17:31.850 --> 00:17:34.570
about two kids who
compete in online Scrabble

00:17:34.570 --> 00:17:37.700
and they have a friendship,
a long distance friendship.

00:17:37.700 --> 00:17:40.160
The reason I chose Scrabble,
are you ready for this?

00:17:40.160 --> 00:17:42.570
This is deep, okay?

00:17:42.570 --> 00:17:48.440
Is because Scrabble is a lot
like life and you're saying why.

00:17:48.440 --> 00:17:52.400
I'm going to tell you.

00:17:52.400 --> 00:17:55.630
Chess is another game that's
featured a lot in fiction right?

00:17:55.630 --> 00:17:58.930
But chess, those of you who
play chess, anyone play chess?

00:17:58.930 --> 00:18:00.230
I play, but not well.

00:18:00.230 --> 00:18:02.690
It's all strategy, right.

00:18:02.690 --> 00:18:04.150
If you're playing
chess correctly,

00:18:04.150 --> 00:18:06.730
it's not luck, it's strategy.

00:18:06.730 --> 00:18:09.730
Scrabble is a mix of luck,

00:18:09.730 --> 00:18:11.240
because you don't know
what cards you're going to;

00:18:11.240 --> 00:18:13.420
not cards, tiles, you don't
know what letters you're going

00:18:13.420 --> 00:18:14.720
to get.

00:18:14.720 --> 00:18:16.840
It's a mix of luck and strategy

00:18:16.840 --> 00:18:19.070
and to me that's kind
of what life is like.

00:18:19.070 --> 00:18:21.340
Also, a lot of people are
familiar with Scrabble even

00:18:21.340 --> 00:18:24.110
if they don't play it, so
it's a good game to choose.

00:18:24.110 --> 00:18:26.510
Thank you, great question.

00:18:26.510 --> 00:18:27.810
&gt;&gt; Do you remember one

00:18:27.810 --> 00:18:30.010
of the first stories
you wrote as a child?

00:18:30.010 --> 00:18:31.310
&gt;&gt; Erin Entrada Kelly: I do.

00:18:31.310 --> 00:18:32.610
I still have them.

00:18:32.610 --> 00:18:36.100
One of the first stories I wrote
is called the "Two Orphans",

00:18:36.100 --> 00:18:38.120
but it was spelled
the "Two Orpans"

00:18:38.120 --> 00:18:40.090
because I forgot the "h."

00:18:40.090 --> 00:18:43.450
I also wrote a lot of
what we would call today a

00:18:43.450 --> 00:18:46.830
"Sweet Valley High" fan fiction.

00:18:46.830 --> 00:18:49.530
But mine was called
"Golden Valley Twins"

00:18:49.530 --> 00:18:51.680
and they were brunettes.

00:18:51.680 --> 00:18:54.190
So, it was original.

00:18:54.190 --> 00:18:57.120
So, those were some
of my first stories.

00:18:57.120 --> 00:18:58.420
Yes.

00:18:58.420 --> 00:19:02.080
&gt;&gt; What advice would you
give to someone who's trying

00:19:02.080 --> 00:19:04.070
to become published themselves?

00:19:04.070 --> 00:19:05.370
&gt;&gt; Erin Entrada Kelly:
My advice,

00:19:05.370 --> 00:19:07.360
my advice is any good
writer is a good reader.

00:19:07.360 --> 00:19:13.040
So, you have to read voraciously
and you have to write a lot,

00:19:13.040 --> 00:19:17.050
and also don't be afraid to
write something that isn't

00:19:17.050 --> 00:19:21.890
that great, because you have
to get it out, practice;

00:19:21.890 --> 00:19:24.620
just like with anything,
just like with any craft,

00:19:24.620 --> 00:19:26.810
you have to work at it.

00:19:26.810 --> 00:19:30.310
But the number one
thing is, to read a lot.

00:19:30.310 --> 00:19:31.610
Yeah.

00:19:31.610 --> 00:19:34.930
&gt;&gt; In your book "Hello,
Universe" one

00:19:34.930 --> 00:19:38.640
of the character's grandmothers
Lola tells him lots of stories

00:19:38.640 --> 00:19:41.520
to kind of stop him from taking
risks and being different

00:19:41.520 --> 00:19:44.170
and I was wondering where
you learned those stories?

00:19:44.170 --> 00:19:45.470
&gt;&gt; Erin Entrada Kelly:
So, Lola in "Hello,

00:19:45.470 --> 00:19:48.020
Universe" is a Filipino
grandmother who uses a lot

00:19:48.020 --> 00:19:50.570
of folktales to tell
life lessons

00:19:50.570 --> 00:19:52.770
and she's modeled after my mom.

00:19:52.770 --> 00:19:54.990
My mom loves to tell stories.

00:19:54.990 --> 00:19:56.890
My mom is a devout Catholic.

00:19:56.890 --> 00:20:00.700
She actually lives in a convent,
and when I was growing up,

00:20:00.700 --> 00:20:04.050
she told a lot of
stories about the saints.

00:20:04.050 --> 00:20:06.890
And I have to tell you, some
of you may know this already,

00:20:06.890 --> 00:20:09.930
but Lola's stories
are very dark.

00:20:09.930 --> 00:20:14.690
The lives of saints also very
dark, you know, there's a lot

00:20:14.690 --> 00:20:18.420
of suffering and a
life lesson at the end.

00:20:18.420 --> 00:20:23.500
So, Lola's stories are
secular but you know based

00:20:23.500 --> 00:20:26.900
in Filipino folklore
and Filipino mythology.

00:20:26.900 --> 00:20:30.240
&gt;&gt; As a kid did you
really like to write?

00:20:30.240 --> 00:20:31.540
&gt;&gt; Erin Entrada Kelly:
I loved to write.

00:20:31.540 --> 00:20:40.100
I started writing when
I was eight years old.

00:20:40.100 --> 00:20:43.170
I loved it.

00:20:43.170 --> 00:20:45.460
&gt;&gt; In your books like in "Hello,

00:20:45.460 --> 00:20:53.280
Universe" did you write the
stories or did that Lola told

00:20:53.280 --> 00:20:55.820
or were they like stories
that you found somewhere?

00:20:55.820 --> 00:20:57.120
&gt;&gt; Erin Entrada Kelly:
It was a mix.

00:20:57.120 --> 00:21:01.100
Lola's folktales are a mix
of actual Filipino folktales

00:21:01.100 --> 00:21:03.450
and folktales that I made up.

00:21:03.450 --> 00:21:05.890
Yes, great question.

00:21:05.890 --> 00:21:09.370
&gt;&gt; Why did you decide
for Valentina and Virgil

00:21:09.370 --> 00:21:11.920
to have the same initials
in "Hello, Universe?"

00:21:11.920 --> 00:21:13.220
&gt;&gt; Erin Entrada Kelly:
Oh, Valencia

00:21:13.220 --> 00:21:15.570
and Virgil have the same,
because what I want you do

00:21:15.570 --> 00:21:17.820
when you read "Hello,
Universe" is wonder if there's

00:21:17.820 --> 00:21:21.430
such a thing as fate
or coincidence,

00:21:21.430 --> 00:21:23.480
so they have the same
initials; is it fate?

00:21:23.480 --> 00:21:24.780
I don't know.

00:21:24.780 --> 00:21:26.080
That's for you decide.

00:21:26.080 --> 00:21:27.630
We have a couple more minutes.

00:21:27.630 --> 00:21:35.170
&gt;&gt; Will you ever write a book
from the bully's perspective

00:21:35.170 --> 00:21:38.360
or will it always be
from the character

00:21:38.360 --> 00:21:39.790
who is getting bullied?

00:21:39.790 --> 00:21:41.090
&gt;&gt; Erin Entrada Kelly:
That is a great question.

00:21:41.090 --> 00:21:42.940
No one has ever asked
me that before.

00:21:42.940 --> 00:21:44.240
I don't know.

00:21:44.240 --> 00:21:45.800
I don't have plans to,
but you never know.

00:21:45.800 --> 00:21:47.180
That would be interesting
wouldn't it?

00:21:47.180 --> 00:21:49.950
Judy Blume did that, my,
she's kind of my idle.

00:21:49.950 --> 00:21:51.380
She wrote a book
called "Blubber" that's

00:21:51.380 --> 00:21:53.780
from the bully's perspective.

00:21:53.780 --> 00:21:55.620
It's one of my favorite books.

00:21:55.620 --> 00:21:56.920
Good question.

00:21:56.920 --> 00:21:58.220
Thank you.

00:21:58.220 --> 00:22:01.040
&gt;&gt; Do you work on one book or
more than one book at a time?

00:22:01.040 --> 00:22:03.410
&gt;&gt; Erin Entrada Kelly: I
work on one book at a time.

00:22:03.410 --> 00:22:07.110
That way I can stay
focused mostly.

00:22:07.110 --> 00:22:12.590
&gt;&gt; How did you decide to
write "Hello, Universe"?

00:22:12.590 --> 00:22:13.890
&gt;&gt; Erin Entrada Kelly:
How did I decide?

00:22:13.890 --> 00:22:16.740
You know what, I thought about
Virgil and I wanted to write

00:22:16.740 --> 00:22:20.250
about a boy who was quiet
and shy and sensitive,

00:22:20.250 --> 00:22:23.210
so we have a lot of girl
characters these days

00:22:23.210 --> 00:22:26.970
who are very outspoken and
strong-willed like Valencia,

00:22:26.970 --> 00:22:30.820
but we also need boy characters
who are shy and sensitive

00:22:30.820 --> 00:22:32.700
and quiet and not
good at sports.

00:22:32.700 --> 00:22:36.890
So, the story started
with Virgil.

00:22:36.890 --> 00:22:40.800
&gt;&gt; What's a tip you
have for future writers?

00:22:40.800 --> 00:22:42.410
&gt;&gt; Erin Entrada Kelly: A tip
I have for future writers;

00:22:42.410 --> 00:22:45.850
I would say, don't give up,
that's good life advice anyway,

00:22:45.850 --> 00:22:48.490
and read a lot of books.

00:22:48.490 --> 00:22:51.820
&gt;&gt; What was your inspiration
for "Hello, Universe"?

00:22:51.820 --> 00:22:54.220
&gt;&gt; Erin Entrada Kelly:
My inspiration is always,

00:22:54.220 --> 00:22:57.320
I'm always inspired
by characters.

00:22:57.320 --> 00:22:58.920
So, when Virgil came
into my head

00:22:58.920 --> 00:23:01.820
and Valencia I was inspired
to tell their story.

00:23:01.820 --> 00:23:04.030
Thank you.

00:23:04.030 --> 00:23:07.100
&gt;&gt; What's your favorite
genre of books to read?

00:23:07.100 --> 00:23:08.400
&gt;&gt; Erin Entrada Kelly:
My favorite genre,

00:23:08.400 --> 00:23:09.700
oh my gosh that's hard.

00:23:09.700 --> 00:23:14.610
I love scary books and
I love scary movies,

00:23:14.610 --> 00:23:16.340
and I like, you know what?

00:23:16.340 --> 00:23:18.480
I pretty much like all books.

00:23:18.480 --> 00:23:21.000
I do like middle grade, I
mean that's what I write.

00:23:21.000 --> 00:23:22.870
So, a couple of my
favorite books are

00:23:22.870 --> 00:23:24.420
"The One and Only Ivan."

00:23:24.420 --> 00:23:25.720
You've read that.

00:23:25.720 --> 00:23:27.580
Yeah, Kathrrine Applegate
is here later I believe,

00:23:27.580 --> 00:23:30.620
and also "When You Reach
Me" by Rebecca Stead.

00:23:30.620 --> 00:23:32.940
Those are two of
my favorite books.

00:23:34.310 --> 00:23:37.930
&gt;&gt; Do you think you're
pretty funny

00:23:37.930 --> 00:23:40.370
or are you books mostly serious?

00:23:40.370 --> 00:23:42.850
&gt;&gt; Erin Entrada Kelly: Do
I think I'm funny or what?

00:23:44.130 --> 00:23:45.430
Curious?

00:23:45.430 --> 00:23:47.370
&gt;&gt; Mostly serious.

00:23:47.370 --> 00:23:48.670
&gt;&gt; Erin Entrada Kelly: Hum?

00:23:48.670 --> 00:23:49.970
Oh, serious.

00:23:49.970 --> 00:23:51.270
&gt;&gt; Are your books
funny or serious?

00:23:51.270 --> 00:23:52.570
&gt;&gt; Erin Entrada Kelly:
Oh, my books.

00:23:52.570 --> 00:23:57.950
Okay, because I'm very
serious and I'm funny.

00:23:57.950 --> 00:24:04.820
No. You know, I would say that
they are a little bit of both.

00:24:04.820 --> 00:24:08.250
I write contemporary, although
next year I have a fantasy

00:24:08.250 --> 00:24:09.950
coming out, my first fantasy,

00:24:09.950 --> 00:24:12.540
but all my books are
contemporary real-life.

00:24:12.540 --> 00:24:16.090
So, it's about as funny as
real-life is [brief laughter].

00:24:17.790 --> 00:24:19.420
Alright last question.

00:24:19.420 --> 00:24:22.470
&gt;&gt; How many books
have you wrote?

00:24:22.470 --> 00:24:24.570
&gt;&gt; Erin Entrada Kelly:
I have four books

00:24:24.570 --> 00:24:26.620
out right now that
are published.

00:24:26.620 --> 00:24:29.790
I've written mountains and
mountains, and one more coming

00:24:29.790 --> 00:24:33.970
out next year and a
bazillion after that probably.

00:24:33.970 --> 00:24:35.940
That's just an estimate
[applause].

00:24:35.940 --> 00:24:37.240
Thank you.

00:24:37.240 --> 00:24:41.090
I'm signing at 2, so
come see me alright,

00:24:41.090 --> 00:24:43.010
and thank you for coming.

00:24:43.010 --> 00:24:44.720
[ Applause ]
