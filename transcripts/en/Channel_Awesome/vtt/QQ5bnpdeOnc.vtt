00:00:14.500 --> 00:00:16.520
I'm Jim and this is "One Day Build".

00:00:16.520 --> 00:00:19.100
With "The Guardians Of The Galaxy" movie coming out,

00:00:19.100 --> 00:00:22.620
I thought it would be fun to build a Star Lord mask,

00:00:22.620 --> 00:00:27.380
Kind of staying in the theme of it being cheap and easy materials you can find,

00:00:27.380 --> 00:00:33.140
Everything you can find at... Like, your local dollar store, hardware store, hobby shop...

00:00:33.140 --> 00:00:35.940
I'm gonna go over some of the core materials that we're gonna use,

00:00:35.940 --> 00:00:38.500
And then we'll just start building and see what happens.

00:00:41.940 --> 00:00:44.600
All right, well these are some of the materials that we're gonna use.

00:00:44.600 --> 00:00:46.840
These are our base, kind of core materials.

00:00:46.840 --> 00:00:52.060
The materials you might use might vary a little bit, but the base... for this whole thing,

00:00:52.060 --> 00:00:53.920
Is going to be this Iron Man mask.

00:00:53.920 --> 00:00:55.840
Now I actually found this at a Five Below,

00:00:55.840 --> 00:00:59.160
Which is kind of like a dollar store, but everything's five bucks or less.

00:00:59.160 --> 00:01:03.500
This was like four/five dollars... There was like, a bin of them, I bought a bunch of them.

00:01:03.500 --> 00:01:06.240
I went to a dollar store, found this child's helmet.

00:01:06.240 --> 00:01:09.760
This will actually be like... The back of the helmet,

00:01:09.760 --> 00:01:12.700
And I think we'll probably use this for the eyes and stuff.

00:01:12.700 --> 00:01:17.520
Other parts are just gonna be kind of random, PVC pieces, bits of plastic,

00:01:17.520 --> 00:01:22.060
Aluminium tubing, I usually keep a bin of just kind of miscellaneous parts.

00:01:22.060 --> 00:01:25.500
You can go to the hardware store and buy some of these pieces.

00:01:26.800 --> 00:01:28.980
I guess that I'm not 100% sure what I'm gonna use yet,

00:01:28.980 --> 00:01:36.680
But some various, pieces of PVC tubing and different cool-looking fittings and stuff.

00:01:37.340 --> 00:01:41.380
Also, I want the eyes to light up in the mask, kind of like it does in the movie,

00:01:42.160 --> 00:01:44.440
Without getting too complicated.

00:01:44.440 --> 00:01:48.220
So again at a dollar store, I went, bought this child's bracelet,

00:01:48.220 --> 00:01:52.560
Yeah it's cool, lights up. It's like fifty cents or something.

00:01:52.940 --> 00:02:02.400
Well, probably the biggest helper here, kind of tool box, is, what I use, is plastic weld.

00:02:02.680 --> 00:02:04.760
It's a two-part epoxy putty,

00:02:05.700 --> 00:02:08.960
Like a plumber's putty, but when you wet your hands,

00:02:09.200 --> 00:02:14.720
It actually becomes really easy, kind of, you can manipulate it a little bit easier,

00:02:14.720 --> 00:02:18.540
Last a little bit longer and you can smooth it really nice with your fingers.

00:02:18.540 --> 00:02:20.880
Let's just start building and see what happens.

00:08:26.100 --> 00:08:28.080
All right...

00:09:23.820 --> 00:09:25.060
All right, so it's coming along,

00:09:25.060 --> 00:09:29.700
It's... You can see it's, kind of starting to take shape now...

00:09:30.480 --> 00:09:33.900
I just kinda glued these with the hot glue gun...

00:09:35.140 --> 00:09:40.740
Just sort of temporarily, just to see how it kind of all looks before I apply any adhesive,

00:09:40.740 --> 00:09:43.940
Or putty in any of the other spots there.

00:09:44.480 --> 00:09:45.200
But, um...

00:09:46.100 --> 00:09:52.360
Yeah, that's... You can see it's starting to look a little similar.

00:09:53.980 --> 00:09:56.360
I'm just gonna use these aluminium tubes.

00:09:56.360 --> 00:09:59.720
I can find these at basically any hobby store,

00:10:01.560 --> 00:10:05.860
Hobby Lobby or Michael's or any model building store,

00:10:05.860 --> 00:10:09.000
Generally can usually get a package of them,

00:10:09.000 --> 00:10:11.820
in various diameters and lengths.

00:10:12.740 --> 00:10:14.440
Or you can buy them individually.

00:10:14.440 --> 00:10:18.200
Pretty inexpensive, they're easy to cut and...

00:10:18.920 --> 00:10:22.980
Yeah, I mean, they're great for having a little piping and tubing and stuff come out.

00:10:24.320 --> 00:10:26.300
Should work great... Oh, the other piping,

00:10:26.300 --> 00:10:29.240
You can also probably use aluminium wire

00:10:29.880 --> 00:10:34.920
to line all the elements and stuff like that, will probably work just as good.

00:10:36.480 --> 00:10:39.080
But yeah, that's it so far...

00:10:39.080 --> 00:10:41.420
Keep, you know, plugging along.

00:10:41.420 --> 00:10:53.260
I think next we're gonna cut the kid's helmet and add that to the back of the helmet and kind of tie it all in.

00:10:56.040 --> 00:10:56.600
Yeah...

00:15:14.380 --> 00:15:19.340
All right well, after about ten hours of work this is what we we're left with:

00:15:20.200 --> 00:15:22.440
The Star Lord mask,

00:15:24.280 --> 00:15:26.800
All in all, turned out pretty well, I thought...

00:15:27.040 --> 00:15:29.500
It looks pretty close to the one that's in the movie,

00:15:29.500 --> 00:15:34.920
Considering we started off with this, yeah, and wound up with this, not too bad.

00:15:36.400 --> 00:15:40.660
A few things I would have liked to have done, would have liked to finish some of the detailing on

00:15:40.660 --> 00:15:43.100
the back of the helmet, it just didn't happen...

00:15:44.060 --> 00:15:47.400
And then I kind of cheated in some of the areas like the...

00:15:47.400 --> 00:15:51.120
I just glued some metallic wall anchors for the detailing there,

00:15:51.120 --> 00:15:56.780
And the face plate, actually, I never sculpted, it's just a piece of plastic that I cut into the shape and

00:15:56.780 --> 00:16:01.000
Covered with aluminium tape, and then kind of penned in the details.

00:16:02.160 --> 00:16:03.140
But actually, that worked pretty good...

00:16:05.580 --> 00:16:07.180
Can turn the lights on here.

00:16:09.220 --> 00:16:11.680
It actually fits pretty good, fits pretty snug...

00:16:12.520 --> 00:16:13.240
And...

00:16:13.900 --> 00:16:14.460
Yeah...

00:16:15.040 --> 00:16:17.580
That's it, you... You too can be Star Lord

00:16:18.920 --> 00:16:24.740
If you want to do it for Halloween or a cosplay or something, hopefully you found this...

00:16:27.020 --> 00:16:29.320
Helpful, or entertaining...

00:16:29.320 --> 00:16:38.160
But... Yeah, you can go out and make your own or, probably wait a couple of weeks and buy one in, like, a toy store.

00:16:39.840 --> 00:16:44.400
I'm sure it won't be long before there'll be Star Lord masks and...

00:16:44.860 --> 00:16:47.920
All the costume shops and toy stores, but...

00:16:47.920 --> 00:16:50.080
But if you're like me and you'd rather build your own...

00:16:51.300 --> 00:16:54.840
Yeah, hopefully, like I said you found this somewhat helpful.

00:16:55.640 --> 00:16:59.560
If so, go ahead and leave me a comment, and yeah,

00:16:59.560 --> 00:17:05.000
Until next time, good luck saving the galaxy, I'm gonna go home and get some sleep.
