as I could bend it for like a week the

worst part of this movie by far is the

00:17:08.449 --> 00:17:08.459
worst part of this movie by far is the
 

00:17:08.459 --> 00:17:11.090
worst part of this movie by far is the
awkward dialogue cutting you can really

00:17:11.090 --> 00:17:11.100
awkward dialogue cutting you can really
 

00:17:11.100 --> 00:17:12.590
awkward dialogue cutting you can really
tell that I would turn the camera and

00:17:12.590 --> 00:17:12.600
tell that I would turn the camera and
 

00:17:12.600 --> 00:17:15.049
tell that I would turn the camera and
say okay say your line cut turn the

00:17:15.049 --> 00:17:15.059

camera okay say your line cut and then I
 

00:17:17.520 --> 00:17:18.949
camera okay say your line cut and then I
did that over and over again without

00:17:18.949 --> 00:17:18.959
did that over and over again without
 

00:17:18.959 --> 00:17:20.630
did that over and over again without
doing like a whole bunch of takes at

00:17:20.630 --> 00:17:20.640
doing like a whole bunch of takes at
 

00:17:20.640 --> 00:17:23.149
doing like a whole bunch of takes at
once so you can really feel the awkward

00:17:23.149 --> 00:17:23.159
once so you can really feel the awkward
 

00:17:23.159 --> 00:17:25.789
once so you can really feel the awkward
flow of dialogue just not feeling

00:17:25.789 --> 00:17:25.799
flow of dialogue just not feeling

which actually was a very dangerous
 

00:18:06.070 --> 00:18:08.010

like really rigid but that's because
 

00:20:05.900 --> 00:20:07.660

00:20:12.190 --> 00:20:12.200
could possibly actually slice you up
 

00:20:12.200 --> 00:20:15.640
could possibly actually slice you up
with a machete so again we were dumb and

00:20:15.640 --> 00:20:15.650
with a machete so again we were dumb and
 

00:20:15.650 --> 00:20:17.770
with a machete so again we were dumb and
we did it but it resulted in that like a

00:20:17.770 --> 00:20:17.780
we did it but it resulted in that like a
 

00:20:17.780 --> 00:20:19.960

00:20:19.970 --> 00:20:58.280
classic little Indiana Jones laughing
funny moment you'll see at the end

00:20:58.280 --> 00:20:58.290
 
 

00:20:58.290 --> 00:21:00.650
 
we tried we tried our best what we had

00:21:00.650 --> 00:21:00.660
we tried we tried our best what we had
 

00:21:00.660 --> 00:21:02.750
we tried we tried our best what we had
and that's all I can really say about

00:21:02.750 --> 00:21:02.760
and that's all I can really say about
 

00:21:02.760 --> 00:21:04.790
and that's all I can really say about
this the shots don't look very good the

00:21:04.790 --> 00:21:04.800
this the shots don't look very good the
 

00:21:04.800 --> 00:21:06.830
this the shots don't look very good the
lighting is awful it's very low def

00:21:06.830 --> 00:21:06.840

there's tons of out-of-focus shots but

00:21:09.320 --> 00:21:09.330
there's tons of out-of-focus shots but
 

00:21:09.330 --> 00:21:12.140
there's tons of out-of-focus shots but
we did try and we did finish it and

00:21:12.140 --> 00:21:12.150
we did try and we did finish it and
 

00:21:12.150 --> 00:21:13.820
we did try and we did finish it and
that's something that I do take pride in

00:21:13.820 --> 00:21:13.830
that's something that I do take pride in
 

00:21:13.830 --> 00:21:15.470
that's something that I do take pride in
because it was hard to make this movie

00:21:15.470 --> 00:21:15.480
because it was hard to make this movie
 

00:21:15.480 --> 00:21:17.750
because it was hard to make this movie
the finale this film involves a gigantic

00:21:17.750 --> 00:21:17.760
the finale this film involves a gigantic
 

00:21:17.760 --> 00:21:20.030
the finale this film involves a gigantic
ladder that was metal that we had to

00:21:20.030 --> 00:21:20.040
ladder that was metal that we had to
 

00:21:20.040 --> 00:21:21.770
ladder that was metal that we had to
drag into the woods and I'm not

00:21:21.770 --> 00:21:21.780
drag into the woods and I'm not
 

00:21:21.780 --> 00:21:23.360
drag into the woods and I'm not
exaggerating I would say it was probably

00:21:23.360 --> 00:21:23.370
exaggerating I would say it was probably
 

00:21:23.370 --> 00:21:26.450
exaggerating I would say it was probably
about at least 150 pounds and we had it

00:21:26.450 --> 00:21:26.460
about at least 150 pounds and we had it
 

00:21:26.460 --> 00:21:28.370
about at least 150 pounds and we had it
in this big box and we had to drag it

00:21:28.370 --> 00:21:28.380
in this big box and we had to drag it
 

00:21:28.380 --> 00:21:29.690
in this big box and we had to drag it
into the woods and we actually did

00:21:29.690 --> 00:21:29.700
into the woods and we actually did
 

00:21:29.700 --> 00:21:31.760
into the woods and we actually did
attach it to this tree and hang it over

00:21:31.760 --> 00:21:31.770
attach it to this tree and hang it over
 

00:21:31.770 --> 00:21:33.710
attach it to this tree and hang it over
a Ledge and have this big finale

00:21:33.710 --> 00:21:33.720
a Ledge and have this big finale
 

00:21:33.720 --> 00:21:35.360
a Ledge and have this big finale
fighting on it that was obviously a

00:21:35.360 --> 00:21:35.370
fighting on it that was obviously a
 

00:21:35.370 --> 00:21:37.070
fighting on it that was obviously a
ripoff for the end of Temple of Doom and

00:21:37.070 --> 00:21:37.080
ripoff for the end of Temple of Doom and
 

00:21:37.080 --> 00:21:39.320
ripoff for the end of Temple of Doom and
it was a lot of fun like it was hard and

00:21:39.320 --> 00:21:39.330
it was a lot of fun like it was hard and
 

00:21:39.330 --> 00:21:40.580
it was a lot of fun like it was hard and
I'll never forget that day and I

00:21:40.580 --> 00:21:40.590
I'll never forget that day and I
 

00:21:40.590 --> 00:21:43.070
I'll never forget that day and I
probably lost five pounds that day just

00:21:43.070 --> 00:21:43.080
probably lost five pounds that day just
 

00:21:43.080 --> 00:21:44.510
probably lost five pounds that day just
from the sweat of carrying that ladder

00:21:44.510 --> 00:21:44.520
from the sweat of carrying that ladder
 

00:21:44.520 --> 00:21:46.370
from the sweat of carrying that ladder
around the woods but we had a good time

00:21:46.370 --> 00:21:46.380
around the woods but we had a good time
 

00:21:46.380 --> 00:21:49.160
