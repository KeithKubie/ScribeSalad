Hi, this is Taryn from
Somerville, Massachusetts.

2
00:00:04,290 --> 00:00:07,740
Radiolab is supported
by dash digital cash.

3
00:00:08,010 --> 00:00:12,570
The quick and easy way to send money to
anyone in the world from anywhere in the

4
00:00:12,571 --> 00:00:13,350
world.

5
00:00:13,350 --> 00:00:18,350
Dash arrives within seconds
and transactions are instant
secure and optionally

6
00:00:19,891 --> 00:00:24,270
private dash is digital
cash. For more information,

7
00:00:24,420 --> 00:00:27,630
visit [inaudible] dot org slash radio lab.

8
00:00:28,440 --> 00:00:30,390
Hello, I'm Jad and I am Robert.

9
00:00:30,460 --> 00:00:34,800
This is radio lab and today our topic
is tinkering I guess tinkering with

10
00:00:34,801 --> 00:00:37,560
nature. Yeah. Or life.
Yes. But Don as we know it,

11
00:00:37,980 --> 00:00:42,060
no cause before the break we heard about
some kids doing something that they

12
00:00:42,061 --> 00:00:42,840
call yes.

13
00:00:42,840 --> 00:00:46,630
Directed evolution by sticking wintergreen
into a place where wintergreen has

14
00:00:46,631 --> 00:00:49,770
never been before, which definitely
qualifies as life, not as we know.

15
00:00:49,890 --> 00:00:52,110
But now it's getting to the
true grit of this cause.

16
00:00:52,140 --> 00:00:54,720
Those kids are looking at life in a,

17
00:00:54,840 --> 00:00:57,780
in a fairly different way
than most of us do. Yes.

18
00:00:57,840 --> 00:01:02,840
It's very interesting that the people
who are creating these living systems are

19
00:01:02,940 --> 00:01:05,970
engineers. This is Lee silver from
Princeton University. I mean they,

20
00:01:05,980 --> 00:01:10,980
they really look at a living system
as no different than a computational,

21
00:01:12,150 --> 00:01:16,160
uh, electronic device. And you, your
hunches there. Right. My hunters,

22
00:01:16,170 --> 00:01:20,550
they're wrong. I don't know quite why
by hunches, they're right. But, um,

23
00:01:20,580 --> 00:01:22,890
most of the world doesn't believe that

24
00:01:26,530 --> 00:01:30,700
include me because I find it very
hard to imagine that that a life

25
00:01:33,140 --> 00:01:37,900
[inaudible] animal leaves it for
a span of years and then dies.

26
00:01:38,310 --> 00:01:40,660
You know, it's like when they die
and the spirit kind of goes out.

27
00:01:40,690 --> 00:01:41,820
It's hard for me to believe that that is

28
00:01:41,830 --> 00:01:45,280
just a chemical machine or
several from parts. Really. Yeah.

29
00:01:46,650 --> 00:01:48,090
Okay. I mean, I guess
I can understand that,

30
00:01:48,091 --> 00:01:51,510
but let me introduce you to
a guy now who's whole, uh,

31
00:01:51,810 --> 00:01:56,040
admittedly young career is based
on the idea that life is a machine,

32
00:01:56,490 --> 00:02:01,120
that it's made of parts, parts that
he can build and sell. Okay. So I'm,

33
00:02:01,121 --> 00:02:02,490
I'm Brian Banes. Brian,

34
00:02:02,520 --> 00:02:06,750
we met actually just down the street
from those MIT kids. He is 31.

35
00:02:06,780 --> 00:02:09,810
That's right. Just 31. And he
runs his own biotech company.

36
00:02:09,900 --> 00:02:12,060
I'm one of the founders
of code on devices here.

37
00:02:12,210 --> 00:02:16,920
We make custom synthetic genes from
scratch and he's doing pretty well.

38
00:02:16,950 --> 00:02:19,830
The industry is gray, sickly doubling
every two years. At this point. I mean,

39
00:02:19,840 --> 00:02:23,060
just to give you a sense of what
Brian does, you with me? Yup.

40
00:02:23,200 --> 00:02:25,410
Just take your example. Those MIT kids,

41
00:02:25,411 --> 00:02:28,480
let's say I'm one of those kids or someone
else who's heard about them and don't

42
00:02:28,500 --> 00:02:32,370
want to take my stinky bacteria
and make it smell better,

43
00:02:32,760 --> 00:02:35,990
or maybe I want to make it glow. All
I have to do is call Brian. Sure.

44
00:02:36,180 --> 00:02:39,720
Because he'll sell me a simple gene
like that for about 1500 bucks.

45
00:02:39,721 --> 00:02:43,950
I just have to go online. Look
up the chemical recipes for

46
00:02:46,980 --> 00:02:51,450
dark. Yes. Here it is. 1200 letters,

47
00:02:51,720 --> 00:02:55,190
t, G, Z, Cesar, letters of DNA, g,

48
00:02:55,200 --> 00:02:58,980
a t and a c of for fundamental
building blocks of DNA. The next,

49
00:02:59,320 --> 00:03:01,320
just list out those A's,
g's and t's and C's. Yeah,

50
00:03:01,420 --> 00:03:04,210
just type them into an email. Generally
they're not typing it themselves.

51
00:03:04,240 --> 00:03:07,570
Imagine trying to type in 2000 letters
by hand without making a mistake and that

52
00:03:07,571 --> 00:03:10,330
would take too long. All right. Just
copy and paste them into an email.

53
00:03:10,331 --> 00:03:13,720
Send them to Brian g. When
we get that in house, we, um,

54
00:03:13,870 --> 00:03:15,240
we're going to take that into our factor.

55
00:03:15,500 --> 00:03:16,333
Sorry.

56
00:03:18,660 --> 00:03:22,140
Brian then plugs the string
of letters into this machine,

57
00:03:22,350 --> 00:03:24,390
which is about the size
of a desktop computer.

58
00:03:24,391 --> 00:03:28,020
We have a synthesis system
where it literally has a
bunch of little A's in a jar

59
00:03:28,021 --> 00:03:31,260
and a bunch of gs in a jar and,
and t's and C's. Now mind you,

60
00:03:31,261 --> 00:03:36,090
these chemicals are in Irt. They are
store bought $100 a bottle. The machine,

61
00:03:36,091 --> 00:03:39,210
they're all connected to reads all
the letters that Brian plugs in

62
00:03:40,980 --> 00:03:45,630
and when it's using a machine,
eh, squirts out some a

63
00:03:48,120 --> 00:03:51,570
TV [inaudible] warts out some t test,

64
00:03:51,600 --> 00:03:56,600
we can add an a or a g or a t or
a c to a growing strand of DNA.

65
00:03:56,911 --> 00:04:01,080
And so we literally adding
one base at a time, C, c.

66
00:04:01,110 --> 00:04:06,110
So what starts as one letter pieces
then grows to 50 then grows to maybe 500

67
00:04:07,740 --> 00:04:11,370
then grows to be 5,000
and at a certain point,

68
00:04:11,400 --> 00:04:14,250
all of these inert chemicals hold hands.

69
00:04:15,180 --> 00:04:17,790
And that's literally how
you make DNA chemically.

70
00:04:17,820 --> 00:04:22,380
That is how you go from dust to
something that is not exactly alive,

71
00:04:22,410 --> 00:04:27,120
but if I take this little speck of DNA
and stick it into my cell, amazingly,

72
00:04:29,580 --> 00:04:34,530
it will start to glow or smell better
or whatever it is that I wanted to do.

73
00:04:34,680 --> 00:04:35,513
It will do it.

74
00:04:35,550 --> 00:04:39,750
It's almost as if the cell is a
computer and this little bit of DNA is a

75
00:04:39,751 --> 00:04:43,250
software program. That's the way
synthetic biologists think about it. Hmm.

76
00:04:43,380 --> 00:04:48,120
And what synthetic biologists are
hoping for us as Lees, that the,

77
00:04:48,150 --> 00:04:51,870
the software, quote unquote, we'll get
standardized. It will come down in price.

78
00:04:52,020 --> 00:04:57,020
So that one day installing new features
into organisms will be just as easy as

79
00:04:57,511 --> 00:04:59,790
when you install new
software on your home PC,

80
00:04:59,940 --> 00:05:03,150
put a word processor or you put a
spreadsheet program user-friendly.

81
00:05:03,210 --> 00:05:05,420
That's kind of the logic.
Yeah, but that's not the,

82
00:05:05,600 --> 00:05:08,460
that's that we're talking about life
here. Life isn't like, you know,

83
00:05:08,461 --> 00:05:10,470
a game of Legos. What if it is,

84
00:05:10,830 --> 00:05:13,770
I mean I know it's weird to think it's
wrong in other words to describe it,

85
00:05:14,790 --> 00:05:16,080
but what if it's not wrong?

86
00:05:16,170 --> 00:05:19,050
Just imagine you can start to look
at things in a completely new way.

87
00:05:19,051 --> 00:05:20,490
You can look at that
creature over there and say,

88
00:05:20,491 --> 00:05:25,230
that creature right there has a talent
that I really like and that went over

89
00:05:25,231 --> 00:05:27,390
there. The second one, it
also does something cool.

90
00:05:27,391 --> 00:05:30,090
Maybe if I take talent one and
talent to stick them together,

91
00:05:30,091 --> 00:05:32,940
put them into a third creature.
Then I've got a little factory.

92
00:05:32,941 --> 00:05:35,370
They can do really cool stuff.

93
00:05:35,530 --> 00:05:39,480
Free eight living things that have
very important functional values.

94
00:05:39,540 --> 00:05:41,850
As an example, in our earlier
conversation with Lee silver,

95
00:05:41,851 --> 00:05:44,490
he brought up a guy named George Church,

96
00:05:44,491 --> 00:05:47,130
George Church as a scientist
at Harvard medical school.

97
00:05:47,190 --> 00:05:50,520
He's thought to be absolutely
brilliant by everybody that knows him.

98
00:05:51,300 --> 00:05:54,150
We actually haven't have a picture of
George on emoney and he showed us, Oh,

99
00:05:54,151 --> 00:05:57,340
is that him? That's him. He typically,
he doesn't click a radical. Let me see.

100
00:05:57,350 --> 00:05:58,890
Let me see what his face
looks like. This guy,

101
00:05:59,090 --> 00:06:01,520
then he's wearing an
army shirt of some kind.

102
00:06:01,521 --> 00:06:05,180
He's got a nice bushy
beard and a spit curl.

103
00:06:05,620 --> 00:06:10,340
It would be Santa Claus
played by Clark Gable. Well,

104
00:06:10,430 --> 00:06:12,710
we had to visit him. Hi, how are you?

105
00:06:13,210 --> 00:06:16,480
And George is unusual as scientists go.

106
00:06:16,700 --> 00:06:20,660
I'm George Church professors genetics at
Harvard Medical School for the last 20

107
00:06:20,661 --> 00:06:21,021
years.

108
00:06:21,021 --> 00:06:25,670
He's been going further and further and
further in terms of synthesizing life.

109
00:06:25,700 --> 00:06:28,810
Okay, I'll slide. You do what
I'll do. I'll slide. He he's,

110
00:06:28,880 --> 00:06:33,440
he's stuffing some kind of big black
rod up my nose. That would be the mic.

111
00:06:33,920 --> 00:06:34,753
Now the kind of creatures,

112
00:06:34,800 --> 00:06:39,800
the George Church engineers are the same
kind of those MIT kids use eco lie by

113
00:06:40,011 --> 00:06:43,260
taking these little tiny
Nikolai and you know,

114
00:06:43,340 --> 00:06:47,510
adding a few genes from other organisms
and tweaking the internal chemistry.

115
00:06:47,511 --> 00:06:50,060
He has gotten the
Nikolai to suck in sugar,

116
00:06:50,061 --> 00:06:54,200
which is what they normally like to
eat. Poop out all kinds of things.

117
00:06:54,230 --> 00:06:58,250
Most notably drum roll please. Diesel

118
00:07:00,170 --> 00:07:01,240
for real. Oh yeah.

119
00:07:01,470 --> 00:07:06,470
Some mean the company I co founded
has produced hydrocarbons status.

120
00:07:06,710 --> 00:07:09,500
Just a fancy way of saying
among other things, diesel,

121
00:07:09,530 --> 00:07:13,880
three different kinds to run in
three types of engines, cars,

122
00:07:13,910 --> 00:07:18,320
trucks and planes. I was
curious to see how it all work.

123
00:07:18,321 --> 00:07:22,460
So he took me to a room at the back of
his lab where he's perfecting the process

124
00:07:22,461 --> 00:07:25,920
and he pointed to a small container. So
here's an example where we might grow,

125
00:07:26,150 --> 00:07:30,650
grow up a large batch of of
cells in a, in a fermentor.

126
00:07:31,160 --> 00:07:33,500
So this big vet right here, which is,

127
00:07:33,620 --> 00:07:38,060
I dunno what's the size of a
couple of liters? Pretty small.

128
00:07:38,061 --> 00:07:39,350
It's about the size of a coke bottle.

129
00:07:39,351 --> 00:07:41,300
And right now he can
only make a few drops.

130
00:07:41,301 --> 00:07:45,080
So there are some scale issues
to solve. But I asked him,

131
00:07:45,081 --> 00:07:46,550
you were to close your eyes and you know,

132
00:07:46,850 --> 00:07:50,270
where does he imagine this stuff going
project forward into the future and he

133
00:07:50,271 --> 00:07:52,490
painted. Describe it for
me. What would it look like?

134
00:07:52,550 --> 00:07:55,640
An amazing picture of
huge bodies of water.

135
00:07:55,670 --> 00:07:58,700
Giant pawns or lakes of gas.

136
00:07:59,970 --> 00:08:01,470
I mean just imagine we could take a boat,

137
00:08:01,471 --> 00:08:05,480
paddle around and be beautiful birds
chirping except under the [inaudible].

138
00:08:06,100 --> 00:08:09,970
Trillions of bacteria would
be busily eating plant life,

139
00:08:10,660 --> 00:08:11,860
burping out diesel fuel,

140
00:08:13,240 --> 00:08:16,420
which then float to the surface
as this kind of gassy foam.

141
00:08:16,480 --> 00:08:20,600
And you can skim it off, skimming off
through into a pipe. There you have it.

142
00:08:23,220 --> 00:08:25,530
I mean this could be the
oil refinery of the future.

143
00:08:25,531 --> 00:08:29,910
No more pumping in out of the ground and
fighting wars. I get that. That's old.

144
00:08:29,940 --> 00:08:31,920
Now we're talking
microbes, man. Mike Rowe.

145
00:08:33,090 --> 00:08:35,430
And this could be just the beginning.
I mean according to Lisa silver,

146
00:08:35,431 --> 00:08:39,810
people are hoping that this kind of
bioengineering can produce all kinds of

147
00:08:39,811 --> 00:08:44,250
stuff. You know, a drug that cures
malaria. Something that makes plastic,

148
00:08:44,640 --> 00:08:48,110
I mean anything. Well I
they would be good. Yeah,

149
00:08:48,270 --> 00:08:50,610
there is part of it that makes
it look me a little uneasy.

150
00:08:51,070 --> 00:08:54,920
Why and and well I wanna introduce
you to another bioengineer.

151
00:08:54,930 --> 00:08:56,130
He's often called the leader

152
00:08:56,130 --> 00:08:59,730
of the pack, like the rat pack.
Sort of like the rat pack.

153
00:08:59,731 --> 00:09:03,870
His name is Craig venter and like the
rat pack folks. He's very talented.

154
00:09:03,871 --> 00:09:07,920
He's very ambitious. He's very driven.
He's also working on a bug for fuel.

155
00:09:08,040 --> 00:09:11,760
He also thinks that the earth is in
trouble. We're messing our nests,

156
00:09:11,790 --> 00:09:15,810
something terrible. And when we were
at the 92nd street y in New York,

157
00:09:15,811 --> 00:09:17,370
he said to them right out loud,

158
00:09:18,050 --> 00:09:21,210
bio engineer creating new
life is our last hope.

159
00:09:21,360 --> 00:09:26,360
It's probably our one major chance of
having our species survive on this planet.

160
00:09:27,660 --> 00:09:32,010
I mean this is the engineering of the
rest of this century and that's a little,

161
00:09:32,011 --> 00:09:33,860
I mean stand aside young man,

162
00:09:33,960 --> 00:09:38,280
I'll rescue now with my magical scientific
ability and my natural engineering

163
00:09:38,281 --> 00:09:42,270
skills. Kids Save the world. I
stand aside and throw them a parade.

164
00:09:42,300 --> 00:09:46,050
Well except that you don't realize just
how ambitious these these guys are.

165
00:09:46,080 --> 00:09:47,850
What's wrong with
ambition? Nothing really.

166
00:09:47,851 --> 00:09:50,610
But what you don't know is
just how bold this guy is.

167
00:09:50,611 --> 00:09:55,000
He not only wants to mix and match
traits that already exist in, in,

168
00:09:55,010 --> 00:09:59,760
in life to make new forms of life.
He wants to do original design.

169
00:09:59,761 --> 00:10:02,400
He wants to think of things
that life has never done before.

170
00:10:02,580 --> 00:10:05,400
Things that are in his
head that are entirely new.

171
00:10:05,550 --> 00:10:09,900
He even dreams of life life form
from, from scratch, from scratch,

172
00:10:09,901 --> 00:10:14,490
completely like 4.1 billion years
ago. Kind of like in Genesis.

173
00:10:16,350 --> 00:10:18,470
It'd probably take a
little longer, but, uh,

174
00:10:20,490 --> 00:10:22,600
I think there will be new life for forms.

175
00:10:22,860 --> 00:10:26,790
You think it will be possible in your
lifetime that someone will go into a store

176
00:10:26,791 --> 00:10:27,541
by dust,

177
00:10:27,541 --> 00:10:30,840
figure out what it is that they have to
do with that desk so that what they make

178
00:10:31,200 --> 00:10:35,100
will be unmistakably alive,
not alive than alive.

179
00:10:35,820 --> 00:10:36,930
Yes. Yes.

180
00:10:36,960 --> 00:10:41,960
But using the knowledge that we have
from studying this 4 billion years of

181
00:10:42,001 --> 00:10:44,650
evolution, we don't want
to write about what,

182
00:10:44,651 --> 00:10:48,870
what if I told you that I thought no,

183
00:10:49,620 --> 00:10:53,640
I don't know why. Just, no, I
think you reviewed my grant.

184
00:10:56,340 --> 00:10:57,031
No, but there's a,

185
00:10:57,031 --> 00:11:01,110
there's a candidness to scientists
that that puzzles me a little bit.

186
00:11:01,111 --> 00:11:04,050
Isn't there something that you think,
and this would be really close to it,

187
00:11:04,200 --> 00:11:08,560
creating life that just
might be out of our grasp.

188
00:11:08,561 --> 00:11:12,740
It might be forever and mysterious
and, and yet you guys like, I mean,

189
00:11:12,770 --> 00:11:16,380
is there anything in the
way of, of engineering life,

190
00:11:16,560 --> 00:11:19,470
is there anything that
you think is not doable?

191
00:11:19,710 --> 00:11:21,690
Do you think it's never going
to happen, that you'll meet,

192
00:11:21,691 --> 00:11:26,691
create a conscious life form from scratch
or it will never happen that you will

193
00:11:26,701 --> 00:11:28,650
create a morally or you know,

194
00:11:28,651 --> 00:11:32,130
a sense of a creature with moral sense
of right and wrong or, I don't know.

195
00:11:32,370 --> 00:11:36,030
I think you think that everything
is possible. Everything.

196
00:11:37,170 --> 00:11:38,003
I think you're right.

197
00:11:47,180 --> 00:11:47,570
[inaudible]

198
00:11:47,570 --> 00:11:51,320
okay. I get that cracking people
like it might have a little bit of a,

199
00:11:51,950 --> 00:11:53,890
of an attitude about they can accomplish,

200
00:11:53,891 --> 00:11:57,400
but is that your problem than he did
he, it's his attitude. No, no, no, no.

201
00:11:57,550 --> 00:11:59,830
It's, it's a sense of life
I think is wrong here.

202
00:12:00,160 --> 00:12:03,100
I really appreciate because of
Darwin and Darwinian evolution,

203
00:12:03,430 --> 00:12:04,990
but it takes 100 million,

204
00:12:04,991 --> 00:12:08,710
200 million a billion years for creatures
to figure out how to live in the

205
00:12:08,711 --> 00:12:11,110
neighborhood of life, how
to know what would fit in,

206
00:12:11,111 --> 00:12:13,060
how you know if you're going to sustain,

207
00:12:13,210 --> 00:12:16,570
you got to learn how to live
harmoniously with the rest of nature.

208
00:12:17,080 --> 00:12:21,390
It takes awhile, but here come these
engineers over some weekend thing.

209
00:12:21,430 --> 00:12:24,010
I have a new idea, maybe
the lead oil or audible,

210
00:12:24,130 --> 00:12:28,300
and then you stick it into the world and
you've just stuck something into a rich

211
00:12:28,301 --> 00:12:33,190
fabric of life and you have no idea of
all the different consequences that could

212
00:12:33,191 --> 00:12:34,870
follow from that decision. Oh look,

213
00:12:34,890 --> 00:12:39,310
look at what happens right now with
antibiotics. That scientist Nigel Golden,

214
00:12:39,560 --> 00:12:43,390
whom he heard from, you know, before 50
years ago, we declared war on microbes.

215
00:12:43,730 --> 00:12:48,250
We, we fed antibiotics to cattle, to
kids when they had virus infections.

216
00:12:48,251 --> 00:12:52,360
We put so much antibiotics into our
bodies and into our food that the bacteria

217
00:12:52,361 --> 00:12:57,361
we were trying to kill figured out a way
to avoid our medicines and now they're

218
00:12:57,490 --> 00:12:59,650
stronger than ever. Not Smart.

219
00:12:59,740 --> 00:13:03,280
We didn't know they were things that we
didn't really understand that we didn't

220
00:13:03,281 --> 00:13:06,430
know, that we didn't understand, and
we're paying the place for that. Now.

221
00:13:06,450 --> 00:13:11,390
I am frightened that these people have
so much ambition and so much certainty in

222
00:13:11,391 --> 00:13:16,040
them that frankly, they don't fear
what biologists don't know about life.

223
00:13:16,070 --> 00:13:19,850
It's a really a Frankenstein story
that is there so much hubris in this.

224
00:13:19,880 --> 00:13:21,770
And as Steve Strogatz will tell you,

225
00:13:22,520 --> 00:13:24,230
biologists and peck scientists
in general know veer.

226
00:13:24,410 --> 00:13:27,310
We now know how much we
don't know about life.

227
00:13:27,440 --> 00:13:30,110
If biology really is
about collective behavior,

228
00:13:30,380 --> 00:13:32,390
the interaction of billions of molecules,

229
00:13:32,391 --> 00:13:36,200
billions of species that
has network of, of life.

230
00:13:36,560 --> 00:13:40,190
We barely understand. You know, we
keep being surprised about life.

231
00:13:40,191 --> 00:13:43,790
On the one hand we can tinker in this
engineering way like the MIT students do

232
00:13:43,910 --> 00:13:46,280
or like venter is doing.
But on the other hand,

233
00:13:46,670 --> 00:13:51,560
the best biologists are still mystified
that we only have about the same number

234
00:13:51,561 --> 00:13:52,940
of genes as a worm.

235
00:13:53,600 --> 00:13:57,470
We're really still missing
99% of the picture, literally.

236
00:13:57,710 --> 00:14:00,620
So it's a scary time today to
start playing Dr Frankenstein,

237
00:14:00,650 --> 00:14:01,790
given how ignorant we are.

238
00:14:01,850 --> 00:14:06,020
Do you know that at Stony Brook University
where your mom worked for all those

239
00:14:06,020 --> 00:14:07,370
years, there was a scientist,

240
00:14:07,400 --> 00:14:12,400
maybe a few doors down from your mom who
who made from scratch using good dust

241
00:14:13,731 --> 00:14:16,400
particles? We've talked
about the polio virus,

242
00:14:16,520 --> 00:14:18,410
which the whole world has
been working to eliminate.

243
00:14:18,411 --> 00:14:22,760
Polio made a new polio
virus. Why? I don't know.

244
00:14:23,840 --> 00:14:25,340
There was a lot of controversy about it,

245
00:14:25,580 --> 00:14:29,750
but there is a guy could perhaps in the
cave somewhere in Afghanistan who wants

246
00:14:29,751 --> 00:14:32,660
to make a polio virus and who will
use it against this [inaudible].

247
00:14:32,850 --> 00:14:37,080
Yeah, yeah, you're right. You're
right. You are right that there is,

248
00:14:37,081 --> 00:14:39,450
there are some bad things
that can happen. Very bad.

249
00:14:39,451 --> 00:14:43,560
So the question is then what? Like what
do you do in the face of that risk?

250
00:14:43,980 --> 00:14:46,440
How do you proceed? Do you
say to these guys, stop.

251
00:14:47,010 --> 00:14:49,680
Would you have these guys
stop doing what they're doing?

252
00:14:49,681 --> 00:14:52,070
Stop doing their experiments.
Asking questions, being

253
00:14:52,070 --> 00:14:55,910
curious. Oh, that'd be ridiculous to
tell the science not to do science.

254
00:14:55,911 --> 00:14:59,480
So what then I,

255
00:15:00,170 --> 00:15:02,810
I don't know. I mean I
don't, I don't know exactly.

256
00:15:04,350 --> 00:15:07,640
Do I want them to, to
not do experiments? No,

257
00:15:07,660 --> 00:15:08,493
I'm not saying don't I,

258
00:15:08,590 --> 00:15:11,400
so I'm not going to be a troglodyte
and say we shouldn't play with these.

259
00:15:11,460 --> 00:15:14,550
And Steve Strogatz agrees. I think
it's great to play with them,

260
00:15:15,150 --> 00:15:19,290
but I'm scared too. I don't know. I'm
confused about it because we have to play.

261
00:15:19,291 --> 00:15:21,240
That's how we make all science, you know,

262
00:15:21,241 --> 00:15:24,620
they speak of Homo ludens human
beings as the player that we,

263
00:15:24,621 --> 00:15:28,620
we are what we are because we like
to play with nature, with ideas,

264
00:15:28,621 --> 00:15:31,740
with language. This is how we
learn things. So we're gonna play,

265
00:15:32,230 --> 00:15:35,100
but we have to be very
careful about how we play.

266
00:15:35,460 --> 00:15:39,600
And we don't want to fall into the
idea that we know more than we, we do.

267
00:15:43,180 --> 00:15:43,450
[inaudible]

268
00:15:43,450 --> 00:15:45,760
we have a vast ocean to
discover it before us.

269
00:16:11,010 --> 00:16:11,190
[inaudible]

270
00:16:11,190 --> 00:16:13,700
okay, well I guess that's
all the time we have. Um,

271
00:16:14,070 --> 00:16:17,430
anything that you heard this hour that
you want to hear again, more information.

272
00:16:17,431 --> 00:16:19,860
It's all on our website, radio lab.org.

273
00:16:19,950 --> 00:16:23,160
Any creature you'd like to build already
designed for creature that you'd like

274
00:16:23,161 --> 00:16:25,850
to build or any monster that you have in
your head that you'd like to make into

275
00:16:26,340 --> 00:16:30,390
wheel living flesh. Send that to us
too. Yes. While you're on our site,
