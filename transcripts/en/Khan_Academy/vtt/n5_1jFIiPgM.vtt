00:00:00.430 --> 00:00:03.840
- Hi, I'm Dave from Khan
Academy, and I want to show you

00:00:03.840 --> 00:00:06.380
how you can preview and make assignments

00:00:06.380 --> 00:00:09.090
from right within the Teacher Dashboard.

00:00:09.090 --> 00:00:12.530
So let's take a look at
how the Content tab works.

00:00:12.530 --> 00:00:15.800
From your Teacher homepage,
click into a class,

00:00:15.800 --> 00:00:17.460
and you'll see the Content tab.

00:00:17.460 --> 00:00:20.980
Scroll down, and you'll see
all the Khan Academy units

00:00:20.980 --> 00:00:24.110
for the subject you've
assigned to that class.

00:00:24.110 --> 00:00:26.910
Skim through the units and select any one

00:00:26.910 --> 00:00:29.310
to view different sections of that unit

00:00:29.310 --> 00:00:31.525
and then individual resources,

00:00:31.525 --> 00:00:34.515
like videos, articles, and exercises,

00:00:34.515 --> 00:00:36.910
quizzes and unit tests.

00:00:36.910 --> 00:00:40.710
For example, this unit begins
with a two-minute video,

00:00:40.710 --> 00:00:43.760
an article, and then a
seven-question problem set.

00:00:43.760 --> 00:00:46.180
By clicking Preview next to a resource,

00:00:46.180 --> 00:00:49.120
you can watch the video, read the article,

00:00:49.120 --> 00:00:51.970
or view the full item bank for an exercise

00:00:51.970 --> 00:00:54.150
before assigning it to your class.

00:00:54.150 --> 00:00:56.050
Looking for something
in a different subject

00:00:56.050 --> 00:00:57.910
or a different grade level?

00:00:57.910 --> 00:01:00.170
You can select additional subjects

00:01:00.170 --> 00:01:02.580
and then quickly switch
from one to another

00:01:02.580 --> 00:01:05.380
to create the perfect
assignments for your students.

00:01:05.380 --> 00:01:06.980
And then it's decision time.

00:01:06.980 --> 00:01:09.570
Select a single assignment or multiple.

00:01:09.570 --> 00:01:13.140
You can now assign several
resources at the same time.

00:01:13.140 --> 00:01:16.130
So select your assignment
and then click Assign.

00:01:16.130 --> 00:01:19.820
Like usual, choose the
classes, students, and due date

00:01:19.820 --> 00:01:20.930
for your assignments.

00:01:20.930 --> 00:01:23.350
Even though this if
for Period 1 right now,

00:01:23.350 --> 00:01:26.760
I could make these assignment
to all of my classes at once,

00:01:26.760 --> 00:01:29.310
or I could assign them
to specific students

00:01:29.310 --> 00:01:30.380
within my class.

00:01:30.380 --> 00:01:33.130
Then I either assign them
to students immediately,

00:01:33.130 --> 00:01:35.450
or I save the assignments to post later.

00:01:35.450 --> 00:01:37.790
Saved assignments will
show up under Assignments

00:01:37.790 --> 00:01:39.830
by clicking the Saved tab.

00:01:39.830 --> 00:01:42.720
We hope the Content
tab will make it easier

00:01:42.720 --> 00:01:45.980
for you to make the assignments
that your students need.

00:01:45.980 --> 00:01:48.080
Check out the content tab today.
