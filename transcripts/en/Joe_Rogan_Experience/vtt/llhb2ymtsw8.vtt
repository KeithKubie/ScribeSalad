1
00:00:00.330 --> 00:00:05.220
Boom,
boom,
boom,
boom.
What's up,
Ben?
How are you man?
Great.

2
00:00:05.550 --> 00:00:07.020
Thanks for coming here man.
I appreciate it.

3
00:00:07.021 --> 00:00:10.950
Thank you for extending the invitation.
Well,
I love your Instagram.
It's very,

4
00:00:11.010 --> 00:00:15.990
it's very informational and tell everybody what you do so people get a handle on

5
00:00:15.991 --> 00:00:20.940
this first.
Um,
uh,
I'm a non permissive environment specialists.

6
00:00:21.180 --> 00:00:23.700
Basically I teach people how to live,

7
00:00:23.701 --> 00:00:26.940
move and travel in places where they probably shouldn't be traveling.
Um,

8
00:00:27.300 --> 00:00:32.040
you know,
how to get out of handcuffs,
how to get out of zip ties.
Um,
and uh,

9
00:00:32.041 --> 00:00:35.040
you know,
I show people how to survive in such environments.
Um,

10
00:00:35.041 --> 00:00:38.670
my background is in law enforcement in Mexico.
So,
you know,

11
00:00:38.671 --> 00:00:41.400
I spent a lot of time down there and,
um,

12
00:00:41.700 --> 00:00:46.320
over the years that's kind of led me into teaching myself how to survive in that

13
00:00:46.321 --> 00:00:49.400
environment.
And,
uh,
apparently after awhile that,
uh,

14
00:00:50.640 --> 00:00:54.090
made me kind of a low sought after as far as teaching other people how to

15
00:00:54.091 --> 00:00:57.210
survive in such environment.
So I've been doing that,
uh,
uh,

16
00:00:57.270 --> 00:01:02.160
for a while here in the u s military law enforcement,
civilians,

17
00:01:02.360 --> 00:01:07.150
all,
yeah.
And you started working in law enforcement.
What year?
Uh,

18
00:01:07.290 --> 00:01:09.750
it's 2004.
2004.

19
00:01:09.870 --> 00:01:14.640
And you started before everything got really crazy.
Yes.
Yes.
Uh,
so you can,

20
00:01:14.641 --> 00:01:19.260
you can kind of trace backwards.
It officially kicked off,
uh,
by the,
uh,

21
00:01:19.261 --> 00:01:23.860
the start of the,
uh,
Phillipe it caused the runes presidency,
which is the,

22
00:01:24.190 --> 00:01:28.020
uh,
the second to last president.
We had,
uh,

23
00:01:28.080 --> 00:01:32.220
he basically said,
you know,
full on war against the cartels.

24
00:01:32.780 --> 00:01:37.710
Um,
and by that time I was Kinda just getting done with my training,

25
00:01:37.770 --> 00:01:38.250
um,

26
00:01:38.250 --> 00:01:42.960
in northern Mexico as a a police officer and what I thought was going to be,

27
00:01:42.961 --> 00:01:46.320
you know,
community policing and stuff like that turned into a full on,
you know,

28
00:01:46.321 --> 00:01:51.090
here's a assault rifle and just go climb up on that Tommy with those military

29
00:01:51.091 --> 00:01:54.450
guys and let's go arrest cartel members.
Oh,
Jesus Christ.

30
00:01:54.690 --> 00:01:59.340
So you thought you were just getting a regular law enforcement Gig,
but yeah,

31
00:01:59.370 --> 00:02:02.610
I mean realistically there was no such that sort of kind of job description.

32
00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:06.810
This was post nine 11.
I was actually in Med school and that,
uh,

33
00:02:06.840 --> 00:02:09.210
the economy and all over the border with the,
uh,

34
00:02:09.600 --> 00:02:12.510
tightened security and stuff like that kind of went down,
you know,

35
00:02:12.511 --> 00:02:16.260
down the drain.
And most of,
uh,
most of the money that I was using for med school,

36
00:02:16.290 --> 00:02:20.820
you know,
went away.
And,
uh,
you know that in the newspaper,
Young,

37
00:02:20.850 --> 00:02:23.740
unmarried individuals that don't have any kids,
you,

38
00:02:23.760 --> 00:02:28.080
you're welcome to join type thing.
Young unmarried individuals with no kids.

39
00:02:28.081 --> 00:02:29.730
They want that specifically.
Yeah.

40
00:02:29.731 --> 00:02:33.710
That was probably a big alarm mills should the center in my head,
but the,
uh,

41
00:02:33.850 --> 00:02:37.110
but the,
but the,
um,
the,
the,
you know,
there were,

42
00:02:37.111 --> 00:02:40.260
there weren't a lot of opportunities for somebody my age there that didn't have

43
00:02:40.261 --> 00:02:44.580
a career.
And I thought it would be,
you know,
everybody said,

44
00:02:44.700 --> 00:02:48.690
don't go,
you know,
but yeah,
I wouldn't say that was your friend though.

45
00:02:49.130 --> 00:02:52.800
I'd be like that.
But it was,
it was,
to me,
it was a challenge.
Uh,

46
00:02:52.860 --> 00:02:54.930
and a lot of people said I couldn't do it,
and I did it.

47
00:02:54.960 --> 00:02:59.550
And then it turned into something that wasn't what most most expect,

48
00:02:59.551 --> 00:03:03.610
that when they went into it and it was a full on urban warfare type situation.

49
00:03:03.700 --> 00:03:06.880
Wow.
So post nine 11,

50
00:03:06.970 --> 00:03:11.970
the borders get tightened up and the economy gets very bad in the border towns.

51
00:03:12.101 --> 00:03:15.750
Is that what happens because people can't get through as easily?
Uh,
it's,
uh,
yeah,

52
00:03:15.760 --> 00:03:20.290
it's heightened security.
So commerce isn't a,
is freely done on both sides.

53
00:03:20.740 --> 00:03:24.580
A Border Wade said you should take an hour now would take three hours or four

54
00:03:24.581 --> 00:03:29.320
hours depending on the time of day.
So,
you know,
things got affected.
Um,
also,

55
00:03:29.321 --> 00:03:32.370
you know,
a worldwide recession,
a situation kind of happened.

56
00:03:32.371 --> 00:03:34.270
So everything kind of went down.
Toilet,
you know,

57
00:03:34.300 --> 00:03:38.530
I have a lot of family in the border region and all like most of our family

58
00:03:38.531 --> 00:03:41.560
businesses that,
uh,
that we had,
you know,

59
00:03:41.561 --> 00:03:46.450
basically kinda tanked and that during that time,
so from nine 11 two,

60
00:03:46.451 --> 00:03:51.190
here we are 18 years later.
It's been a pretty radical change.
Yes.

61
00:03:51.280 --> 00:03:54.760
Safe to say yes.
100% change.

62
00:03:54.761 --> 00:03:59.080
Like what if you had to like try to describe it?
So,
I mean,
uh,

63
00:03:59.740 --> 00:04:04.720
basically they,
uh,
the,
the part of the country that I had most of my experiences,

64
00:04:04.750 --> 00:04:09.070
the Baha Sonora Juarez type region in northern Mexico.

65
00:04:09.071 --> 00:04:14.071
Basically what happened is that all the cartels started fighting for the most

66
00:04:14.561 --> 00:04:18.040
rich drug routes on the planet.
Um,
one of them,
of course,

67
00:04:18.041 --> 00:04:22.150
being the city of Tijuana.
So the city of Tijuana is,

68
00:04:22.240 --> 00:04:24.910
that's the corner of Latin America.
It's the most,

69
00:04:25.360 --> 00:04:30.160
it's the most cross border on the planet.
And with that,

70
00:04:30.190 --> 00:04:32.530
you know,
there's a lot of commerce that goes on in that region.

71
00:04:32.590 --> 00:04:35.550
A lot of things that chip to Tijuana and then dropped Jovan up into,

72
00:04:35.580 --> 00:04:36.520
into San Diego.

73
00:04:36.970 --> 00:04:41.880
And a lot of people have businesses on both sides and amongst,
uh,

74
00:04:41.890 --> 00:04:44.990
among all of this a movement,
you know,

75
00:04:45.040 --> 00:04:50.040
there's a giant organized crime war going on and it used to be over,

76
00:04:50.980 --> 00:04:55.270
like on the streets,
uh,
mid middle of the day you would see these cartel convoys,

77
00:04:55.690 --> 00:04:57.100
uh,
arriving at a restaurant,

78
00:04:57.140 --> 00:05:01.180
all the cartel guys outside with her a case and stuff like that.
This was 2004,

79
00:05:01.181 --> 00:05:03.740
2005 era.
Um,
and what,

80
00:05:03.840 --> 00:05:07.600
what is the military or law enforcement attitude towards that?
Like how did they,

81
00:05:07.780 --> 00:05:12.780
so we go back to 2004 when I first got started and it was look the other way.

82
00:05:13.210 --> 00:05:15.280
Really?
Yes.
Look the other way.

83
00:05:15.320 --> 00:05:18.640
Look the other way was specific instruction that you got.
Uh,

84
00:05:18.730 --> 00:05:23.680
it was one of those things where I went there and I got a,
I got a firearm.

85
00:05:23.740 --> 00:05:26.280
Here you go,
here's your glock 17.
Uh,
here,

86
00:05:26.281 --> 00:05:30.520
you two magazines a here's your Mazda 500.
And uh,

87
00:05:30.550 --> 00:05:35.440
you see all those cars over there.
We don't ask them for anything,
let them pass.

88
00:05:35.470 --> 00:05:38.320
That's,
you know,
we don't do anything.
Wow.
That nature.

89
00:05:38.680 --> 00:05:40.720
And then it would see members of the military as well.

90
00:05:40.721 --> 00:05:45.070
Kind of a go the other way,
type situation to this 2004.

91
00:05:45.280 --> 00:05:50.280
Do you think that this was just to avoid conflict or what was it because of

92
00:05:50.291 --> 00:05:54.920
corruption?
It's,
it's always corruption.
I mean,
it always levels at [inaudible],

93
00:05:55.050 --> 00:05:57.320
all those types of levels down there.
During this time,

94
00:05:57.321 --> 00:06:02.090
there was a lot of corruption.
Um,
things changed,
but you know,
things in a way,

95
00:06:02.091 --> 00:06:04.650
in some levels are always the same.
Uh,

96
00:06:04.700 --> 00:06:06.890
there's definitely some sort of pact going on,

97
00:06:06.920 --> 00:06:11.510
some sort of fear based packed during that time.
And uh,

98
00:06:11.930 --> 00:06:14.840
when,
uh,
Felipe,
he called the wrong,
finally said,
you know,
enough is enough.

99
00:06:14.841 --> 00:06:16.670
We're going to declare war.
Uh,

100
00:06:16.671 --> 00:06:20.840
he basically militarized a lot of the kind of narcotic efforts in Mexico.

101
00:06:21.350 --> 00:06:25.930
So the military went from being,
you know,
in their,
in their,
um,

102
00:06:25.970 --> 00:06:30.970
bases or manning stations out there to actually actively going out and looking

103
00:06:32.391 --> 00:06:36.050
for cartel cells and trying to eliminate them.
Right?
Uh,

104
00:06:36.320 --> 00:06:39.200
so basically army on the street type situation.

105
00:06:39.830 --> 00:06:42.230
And another thing he did was basically all of the police chief.

106
00:06:42.260 --> 00:06:47.260
A lot of the police chiefs around the country were being traded out for former

107
00:06:48.051 --> 00:06:52.760
military officials or,
or military guys,
uh,
officers.

108
00:06:53.120 --> 00:06:56.840
One of them was Lieutenant Colonel Lee's Ella.
Uh,
I dunno if you're,

109
00:06:56.870 --> 00:07:00.020
maybe your audience is audience could look him up and he's a very famous

110
00:07:00.021 --> 00:07:01.700
lieutenant colonel from Mexico x.

111
00:07:01.760 --> 00:07:06.760
He has a documentary on him called Mexico's most of the bravest man.

112
00:07:07.550 --> 00:07:11.750
Very,
pretty interesting guy.
Um,
he was the one that,
uh,

113
00:07:12.230 --> 00:07:14.960
headed us up.
He directed us at the start of this,

114
00:07:14.961 --> 00:07:19.880
these operations gets to cocktails.
And he basically said,
you know,
this is a,

115
00:07:19.881 --> 00:07:23.210
this is in the policing problem.
This is a counter insurgency problem.

116
00:07:23.211 --> 00:07:26.630
So we're going to,
whoa,
we're going to militarize it basically.

117
00:07:27.380 --> 00:07:30.380
And after he kind of took control everything,

118
00:07:30.560 --> 00:07:33.050
everything in it changed,
you know,

119
00:07:33.080 --> 00:07:35.360
there weren't of the cartels went to as a verb as they were,

120
00:07:35.361 --> 00:07:39.500
so he started going under ground.
So when you joined,

121
00:07:40.280 --> 00:07:45.280
you expected it to be regular law enforcement when it became this counter

122
00:07:45.980 --> 00:07:50.180
insurgency militarized effort against the cartels.

123
00:07:50.420 --> 00:07:53.360
Was there ever a time where you were like,
I gotta get the fuck out of this job?

124
00:07:53.850 --> 00:07:57.380
This is too dangerous?
Uh,
yeah.
I mean,
uh,
my generation,

125
00:07:57.381 --> 00:08:01.580
I was part of this seventh generation of,
of,
uh,
officers go going through this,

126
00:08:01.581 --> 00:08:06.020
uh,
this program,
uh,
policing and out of my generation,

127
00:08:06.021 --> 00:08:11.021
the first year we had two of them in jail for corruption charges and three dead,

128
00:08:13.340 --> 00:08:17.420
you know,
just out of how many out of a 23 guys.

129
00:08:17.450 --> 00:08:22.430
So just 23 guys to in jail,
five gone,
five gone,
a w,
two of them,

130
00:08:22.760 --> 00:08:23.541
very dramatic.

131
00:08:23.541 --> 00:08:28.541
That's two of them were kind of the origins of how I got into the whole counter

132
00:08:28.761 --> 00:08:30.620
abduction type thing.
Uh,

133
00:08:30.621 --> 00:08:34.400
two of my guys got to picked up outside of a hotel in the downtown,
the Quanta,

134
00:08:34.700 --> 00:08:36.920
and,
uh,
by,

135
00:08:37.460 --> 00:08:40.820
by cartel members dressed as federal police,
police officers.

136
00:08:40.880 --> 00:08:45.620
That whole nine jars is the uniforms,
the car,
everything cloned.
They got,

137
00:08:45.621 --> 00:08:50.480
uh,
they got asked for their papers outside and got put into a van.

138
00:08:50.600 --> 00:08:53.920
They found the day later,
you know,
uh,

139
00:08:54.960 --> 00:08:59.220
horribly mutilated and all this type of stuff.
Tortured,
tortured,
you know,

140
00:08:59.280 --> 00:09:04.200
and that kind of,
you know,
that was the,
this is real,

141
00:09:04.800 --> 00:09:08.940
this is real.
And I should probably have a,
you know,
escape plan.

142
00:09:10.440 --> 00:09:15.210
And,
uh,
but it,
it wasn't a,
I didn't know anything else,

143
00:09:15.211 --> 00:09:15.750
basically.

144
00:09:15.750 --> 00:09:20.580
So it wasn't like I had something to fall back on and it was good pay for what

145
00:09:20.581 --> 00:09:25.110
it was and yeah.
But feared that that's when fear got,

146
00:09:25.260 --> 00:09:30.240
you know,
the stress must be insane.
Yeah.
It's,
you're always on,
you know,
uh,

147
00:09:30.300 --> 00:09:35.070
there's,
uh,
you know,
we prototyped this thing on the,
on the meeting wall.

148
00:09:35.071 --> 00:09:38.100
It said there's no vacation.
Even when there's vacation,
you know,

149
00:09:38.280 --> 00:09:41.400
you would go on vacation,
you would get your gun to go on vacation.
Of course.

150
00:09:41.730 --> 00:09:44.850
Yeah.
It was pretty insane.
Now,

151
00:09:45.210 --> 00:09:50.130
have you ever been confronted?
Yeah.
Yes.
Yeah,
of course.
I mean,

152
00:09:50.131 --> 00:09:54.030
there's no,
there's the,
there's no,
uh,
it's not,
you know,

153
00:09:54.060 --> 00:09:56.910
I have a lot of friends that are in a military up here in the u s

154
00:09:58.700 --> 00:10:01.380
and it's not like a,
it's not like them,

155
00:10:01.381 --> 00:10:05.070
they go off overseas and they do something in a different country with different

156
00:10:05.071 --> 00:10:06.960
people with don't speak the same language.

157
00:10:07.440 --> 00:10:11.220
I was doing all of this in the place I grew up rule,
right.

158
00:10:11.221 --> 00:10:16.010
So I knew some of these people at times,
you know,
I,
um,

159
00:10:16.310 --> 00:10:18.240
we,
we,
uh,
every now and then I would say,
Hey,

160
00:10:18.241 --> 00:10:22.500
I know that guy from when I was a kid or we were in school together and now he

161
00:10:22.501 --> 00:10:26.310
has a plate carrier where they,
and Ak 47 and a gold gun on his bands.
Right?

162
00:10:26.311 --> 00:10:29.970
And it's like,
Whoa,
eh,
the gold guns,
big giveaway,

163
00:10:30.390 --> 00:10:33.360
all gold guns or you know,
that's how,
you know.
Yeah,

164
00:10:33.390 --> 00:10:38.390
there's some amazing websites that document all the different stuff that the

165
00:10:38.431 --> 00:10:42.240
cartel house,
but they love gold guns.
Yeah.
That's a heel.

166
00:10:42.330 --> 00:10:46.290
Chapo got like a gold,
a very special goals gun.
When he was a,

167
00:10:47.070 --> 00:10:51.660
when he was named a one,
uh,
one of the top earners in Forbes,
the Forbes list,

168
00:10:51.661 --> 00:10:53.460
I think he got his number on the gun and everything.

169
00:10:54.120 --> 00:10:57.470
The second to last time he got caught because he got caught a lot of times in

170
00:10:57.471 --> 00:11:02.310
this case,
uh,
somebody,
somebody in the military that got him,
took it,

171
00:11:02.400 --> 00:11:05.370
you know,
and it ended up in the museum.
I think it's,

172
00:11:05.460 --> 00:11:09.240
I think it's in a museum somewhere in Mexico City where a lot of these gold guns

173
00:11:09.270 --> 00:11:11.610
at the ward trophy for those guys.
Right.

174
00:11:11.611 --> 00:11:15.290
So this is like a gold gun section of the museum.
Yes.
Yes.
Areas.

175
00:11:15.400 --> 00:11:20.050
Mexican Mexico City.
Wow.
Yeah,
that's pretty wild.
Uh,
gold gun.

176
00:11:20.070 --> 00:11:24.420
Goldacre AK 47.
Now,
if everything is so corrupt on there,

177
00:11:24.421 --> 00:11:28.170
how does a guy like El Chapo keep getting popped?
I mean,
cause when I,

178
00:11:28.171 --> 00:11:31.830
when I saw his escape,
yeah,
I was like,
this is hilarious.

179
00:11:31.980 --> 00:11:36.330
The fact that this guy goes to the toilet and then he opens a door and boop,

180
00:11:36.360 --> 00:11:40.710
he's in a tunnel and on an electric scooter and goes a mile pops up on the other

181
00:11:40.711 --> 00:11:45.600
side and they had everything set up for them with electricity.
Like,
uh,
I mean,

182
00:11:45.630 --> 00:11:47.820
uh,
you know,
the,
uh,
I think the,

183
00:11:47.821 --> 00:11:52.350
the thing that people kind of don't understand about the corruption is it's not

184
00:11:52.351 --> 00:11:55.190
just corruption because people are greedy.
It's all good.

185
00:11:55.390 --> 00:11:59.980
It's also fear based corruption.
So if you don't do what I say,

186
00:12:00.730 --> 00:12:04.840
we're going to kill everybody in your family,
even your dog,
that type of thing.

187
00:12:05.680 --> 00:12:10.240
So,
uh,
after the whole Chapo got it escaped that last time,

188
00:12:10.360 --> 00:12:11.500
um,
you know,

189
00:12:11.501 --> 00:12:16.501
all of the staff at the jail got put in prison and so they were all part of it.

190
00:12:17.890 --> 00:12:20.690
There's rumors that they were,
you know,
um,
you know,

191
00:12:20.740 --> 00:12:23.840
was like somebody had to hear all that digging.
Of course.
I mean,

192
00:12:23.890 --> 00:12:28.240
it's only a mile away.
They,
well,
it was pretty deep.

193
00:12:28.660 --> 00:12:32.440
Yeah.
Uh,
some,
some,
some things that should have been patrolled.
Warren patrolled,

194
00:12:33.280 --> 00:12:38.080
uh,
it was a pretty good,
well made tunnel for what it was really well made.

195
00:12:38.170 --> 00:12:42.790
So a lot of the people that old chapel actually used for these tunnel operations

196
00:12:42.791 --> 00:12:46.060
because the same people that he used for the tunnels in the border region,

197
00:12:46.720 --> 00:12:50.950
all the active tunnels that are somewhere,
you know,
along the border.
Uh,

198
00:12:50.980 --> 00:12:54.220
all of those guys were pulled in from,
uh,
from,
uh,

199
00:12:54.280 --> 00:12:58.000
silver mining companies that used to operate all over Mexico that kind of went

200
00:12:58.001 --> 00:13:02.590
into the toilet.
So they were looking for jobs and wow,
get el Chapo out.
Good job.

201
00:13:02.650 --> 00:13:07.330
That's Lauren or drug titles.
You know,
when you saw all that shit,

202
00:13:07.331 --> 00:13:12.331
go down with Sean Penn and Sean Penn visiting El Chapo and Sean Penn writing an

203
00:13:13.091 --> 00:13:16.210
article for rolling stone like arts.
Were you like,

204
00:13:16.211 --> 00:13:20.920
what in the fuck is going on here?
Uh,
yes.
Uh,

205
00:13:21.130 --> 00:13:24.870
for a lot of PR.
Some reasons that might not be,
you know,

206
00:13:25.810 --> 00:13:29.360
mainly was why are they giving him,
uh,
uh,

207
00:13:29.520 --> 00:13:32.920
why are they giving him this celebrity status?
You know,
uh,

208
00:13:32.980 --> 00:13:37.060
there's a lot of glorification and a lot of,
uh,
you know,

209
00:13:37.120 --> 00:13:39.550
people venerating some of these people down there,
you know,

210
00:13:39.551 --> 00:13:41.350
and they do a lot of harm,
you know,

211
00:13:41.351 --> 00:13:43.720
so then you're basically giving a voice to somebody.

212
00:13:43.750 --> 00:13:47.590
It would be the equivalent of somebody up here giving a voice to somebody that

213
00:13:47.680 --> 00:13:51.540
was responsible for a lot of damage done to the u s you know,
it's,

214
00:13:51.700 --> 00:13:54.940
why do you think they did that?
Like what,
what,
what was the Roman,
there was,

215
00:13:54.941 --> 00:13:58.810
it was romantic.
Right?
There's something about it.
It's like,
here's Sean Penn,

216
00:13:58.840 --> 00:14:03.430
one of our biggest movie stars.
Yeah.
One of the biggest drug dealers ever.
I mean,

217
00:14:03.460 --> 00:14:08.460
he is a El Chapo down because I been to see an LOI and I've done classes there,

218
00:14:09.040 --> 00:14:13.750
which was pretty surreal.
Um,
he is,
uh,
he's a folk hero.

219
00:14:13.930 --> 00:14:15.850
He's,
uh,
he's,
uh,

220
00:14:16.780 --> 00:14:20.290
he's Robin Hood basically to these people.
And like,
uh,

221
00:14:20.320 --> 00:14:23.680
when this surreal moment that I had down there striving along this

222
00:14:25.480 --> 00:14:29.410
bad bumpy ride highway and all of a sudden turn into a nice,

223
00:14:29.560 --> 00:14:33.700
that kind of highway.
And,
uh,
the guys that I was told me,
Oh yeah,

224
00:14:33.701 --> 00:14:37.480
this is the cartel made this highway and the back part of it,

225
00:14:37.481 --> 00:14:42.130
that's the government,
the part of the highway for this,
you know,
uh,

226
00:14:42.190 --> 00:14:46.090
schools,
uh,
careers,
lawyers,
doctors,

227
00:14:46.540 --> 00:14:49.360
all their careers paid for by blame cartel,

228
00:14:49.690 --> 00:14:53.260
immigration processes of people that want to come over here.
Sponsorships,

229
00:14:53.270 --> 00:14:57.150
all type of stuff on both sides.
Right.
So the,

230
00:14:57.160 --> 00:15:01.700
the span of influence,
that's,
you know,
that's how he kind of got to where he was.

231
00:15:02.060 --> 00:15:06.470
He was always helping people and he was investing in people and these people,

232
00:15:06.471 --> 00:15:09.650
this is,
these investments would pay later on,
you know,

233
00:15:10.100 --> 00:15:13.220
in a lot of ways it sounds like he,
he benefited them.

234
00:15:13.490 --> 00:15:17.010
He benefited some aspects of the community.
Yeah.
I mean,
uh,
the,

235
00:15:17.011 --> 00:15:18.980
the reason why the military couldn't get them,

236
00:15:19.460 --> 00:15:22.760
you get people said could take irruption,
but because the,
he was basically,

237
00:15:22.761 --> 00:15:27.170
he had a,
a human shield around them,
you know,
all these towns owed,

238
00:15:27.760 --> 00:15:32.150
you know,
schools,
hospitals,
every,
uh,

239
00:15:32.240 --> 00:15:35.610
instead of Christmas down that they celebrate the day of the Kings,
you know,
um,

240
00:15:35.690 --> 00:15:38.750
so they would get presents mother's Day,
they would all get presence,

241
00:15:38.751 --> 00:15:39.500
that type of thing.

242
00:15:39.500 --> 00:15:44.500
So why would we want to help them nudge Harry come in here and gala Chapo or

243
00:15:44.861 --> 00:15:47.150
he's doing this type of stuff,
you know,
that's,

244
00:15:47.151 --> 00:15:51.780
and that is the same all over Mexico with some of the cartels,
you know,
they,

245
00:15:51.781 --> 00:15:55.130
they,
uh,
hearts and mind carton minds type approaches.

246
00:15:55.130 --> 00:15:57.920
What makes some of these groups,
you know,
long lived.

247
00:15:58.430 --> 00:16:02.150
So how much of an effort is there to eradicate the cartels?

248
00:16:02.151 --> 00:16:04.340
Because if you can get a guy like El Chapo,

249
00:16:04.341 --> 00:16:07.320
who at least in terms of like popularity's at the time,

250
00:16:07.400 --> 00:16:11.390
is he at the top of the list,
let's put our popularity.
But at the top,

251
00:16:11.540 --> 00:16:14.290
he's at the top of the list as far as popularity.
But when,

252
00:16:14.330 --> 00:16:18.170
as far as like the actual drug dealers is here at the top of the list or their

253
00:16:18.230 --> 00:16:20.500
more clever folks at Hyde underground.
Yeah,
there's,

254
00:16:20.640 --> 00:16:25.070
there's rumors of people above them that are still out there somewhere.

255
00:16:25.071 --> 00:16:27.710
That's what everybody like that's the great conspiracy.

256
00:16:27.740 --> 00:16:31.860
Is that like El Chapo is basically the bank manager that,
well,
you know,

257
00:16:31.880 --> 00:16:35.990
there's a,
he has a,
a compadre a compadre somebody that if you're the daughter,

258
00:16:36.020 --> 00:16:39.470
if you're the godfather of my,
my kid,
you're my compadre.
Right.

259
00:16:39.950 --> 00:16:44.020
So he has a compadre out there,
uh,
and mio,
some Baba,
um,

260
00:16:44.090 --> 00:16:47.310
and he is still out there.
Right.
And the,
uh,

261
00:16:47.360 --> 00:16:51.260
the extent of how he works and where he works is unknown.

262
00:16:51.830 --> 00:16:56.420
So He's more slick.
Exactly.
He tries to stay more low key.
Well,
uh,
there's,

263
00:16:56.510 --> 00:17:00.500
you know,
some people get sick with the fame,
probably you want to go outside.

264
00:17:00.660 --> 00:17:05.530
Well,
once that the TV show narcos came on,
yeah.
Then every,
well with people,

265
00:17:05.620 --> 00:17:05.930
I don't,

266
00:17:05.930 --> 00:17:10.130
I think there's a lot of people who did not realize how crazy the life of Pablo

267
00:17:10.130 --> 00:17:14.910
Escobar was and what really went down in Columbia.
Yeah.
I mean,
it's crazy.
Uh,

268
00:17:15.640 --> 00:17:19.670
Paul Escobar was a single,
you know,
he was a phenomenon in this time and age,

269
00:17:19.671 --> 00:17:20.720
but he was one man,

270
00:17:21.400 --> 00:17:25.970
I'll imagine replicating that type of insanity over the span of Mexico.

271
00:17:26.090 --> 00:17:29.750
And it's about eight or nine guys,
you know,

272
00:17:30.470 --> 00:17:34.500
that was the 90s,
early two thousands,
uh,

273
00:17:34.580 --> 00:17:36.980
because these guys were,
you know,

274
00:17:36.981 --> 00:17:39.590
Legion of doom type thing where they would be enemies,

275
00:17:39.591 --> 00:17:42.920
but they would have reunions and they would meet up and kind of agree on,

276
00:17:42.921 --> 00:17:47.910
you know,
certain terms and stuff.
Just like in,
in the Pablo Escobar show.
Yeah,

277
00:17:48.250 --> 00:17:50.160
yeah,
yeah.
So they really do that.

278
00:17:50.161 --> 00:17:53.520
They get together and have meetings and sometimes they kill each other.
That's,

279
00:17:53.550 --> 00:17:56.830
that's the,
uh,
that's the,
uh,
that's a reality.
You know,
they,

280
00:17:56.831 --> 00:18:01.390
they do and at times or did at times because things are currently after all

281
00:18:01.410 --> 00:18:06.240
Chapo,
you know,
things kind of shifted and changed.
What happened?
Uh,

282
00:18:06.360 --> 00:18:10.920
well,
main thing is a power vacuum and with a power vacuum and,

283
00:18:12.000 --> 00:18:16.240
um,
legalization on this side of certain substances,

284
00:18:16.241 --> 00:18:20.880
substances like,
uh,
uh,
marijuana.
Um,
the,

285
00:18:21.180 --> 00:18:24.900
the,
the pot fields are now poppy fields and,

286
00:18:25.590 --> 00:18:29.130
and new new things like,
um,
like,
um,

287
00:18:30.660 --> 00:18:34.270
like them now dedicated themselves to heroin instead of,
uh,

288
00:18:34.480 --> 00:18:37.380
instead of the weed was,
but seriously,
they're still,

289
00:18:37.440 --> 00:18:38.970
we'd fields down there for some reason.

290
00:18:39.270 --> 00:18:42.630
You guys are way better at making it than anybody time there,

291
00:18:42.650 --> 00:18:44.370
but for some reason they're still is with wheat fields.

292
00:18:44.580 --> 00:18:48.120
But I think it's a lot of access,
especially in the states where it's prohibited.

293
00:18:48.390 --> 00:18:52.080
Yeah.
Just,
they're probably more willing to get it to the people's probably it,

294
00:18:52.170 --> 00:18:53.790
uh,
math,
uh,

295
00:18:53.820 --> 00:18:58.820
math precursors being brought in from China and to Mexico or now being made in

296
00:18:59.191 --> 00:19:02.580
Mexico,
like industrial level stuff.
Right.

297
00:19:02.910 --> 00:19:07.910
And I knew up a new upsurging cartel down there that is trying to overtake the

298
00:19:09.031 --> 00:19:10.140
senior lawyer cartel,

299
00:19:10.270 --> 00:19:15.270
the new generation carto as coming out of Wallet Hora and they're kind of really

300
00:19:16.591 --> 00:19:21.060
militarized kind of wing of a cartel activities that are trying to,
you know,

301
00:19:21.090 --> 00:19:25.710
take control over the whole thing.
What is the plan in terms of the government?

302
00:19:25.711 --> 00:19:28.110
I mean if they,
if they can take out a guy like El Chapo,

303
00:19:28.170 --> 00:19:32.280
what is the plans to eradicate all this and is there really a plan to eradicate

304
00:19:32.281 --> 00:19:35.880
it or is it one of those things where it's sort of a plan on paper,

305
00:19:36.120 --> 00:19:39.120
but realistically they sort of accept the fact they're never going to get rid of

306
00:19:39.121 --> 00:19:43.940
these people?
So,
uh,
I have,
uh,
like I have a thing like that.
Like basically,
uh,

307
00:19:44.170 --> 00:19:49.170
[inaudible] was a feather Turpin and I have a image of a feather to Chirp and

308
00:19:49.561 --> 00:19:53.190
biting itself.
Mexico has a problem with Amnesia,

309
00:19:53.470 --> 00:19:55.770
a six year cycle of Amnesia.

310
00:19:56.250 --> 00:19:59.370
Every president comes in and has all these plans to eradicate the cartels.

311
00:19:59.670 --> 00:20:02.910
President goes out,
nobody likes him anymore.
New Guy comes in and says,
well,

312
00:20:02.911 --> 00:20:06.300
I have a better plan.
You know,
and that's the cycle we always go through.

313
00:20:06.450 --> 00:20:09.720
So it's a big issue in Mexico.
Yeah.
And current.

314
00:20:09.750 --> 00:20:14.520
Currently we have a leftist president that doesn't want to have anything to do

315
00:20:14.521 --> 00:20:19.230
with the past
administration that are more on the right of the spectrum.

316
00:20:19.800 --> 00:20:24.360
His name is Andres Manuel Lopez.
Obrador.
I'm low,
uh,

317
00:20:24.390 --> 00:20:28.800
vocally supporting Venezuela,
um,
that,
that type of guy.

318
00:20:28.890 --> 00:20:32.220
Apparently he has a good relationship with the,
with Trump.
Uh,
that's,

319
00:20:32.320 --> 00:20:34.380
that's what people say.
Uh,

320
00:20:34.381 --> 00:20:38.760
but his whole thing was amnesty for the cartels.
That's a campaign promise.

321
00:20:39.540 --> 00:20:44.280
Amnesty.
Yes.
And what does that mean exactly?
Nobody knows what that means.

322
00:20:44.730 --> 00:20:45.960
That's what he was saying.
That was,

323
00:20:45.961 --> 00:20:50.680
you have a plan for amnesty or is it just like a statement a,
it was a statement.

324
00:20:50.770 --> 00:20:55.270
And now if you see a counter narcotics operations throughout the country,
they,

325
00:20:55.330 --> 00:20:59.230
uh,
the military is not as active as it used to be.
Whoa.

326
00:20:59.910 --> 00:21:03.580
Uh,
some of the cartels are growing in influence,
um,

327
00:21:03.760 --> 00:21:06.700
because of amnesty could be,
you know,
uh,

328
00:21:06.830 --> 00:21:09.840
basically I don't see the efforts that were there,
uh,

329
00:21:09.910 --> 00:21:13.810
when I was active down there.
Oh,
things change,
you know,

330
00:21:14.380 --> 00:21:18.900
so I don't know.
I,
I truly think that the absurd because we're,

331
00:21:18.910 --> 00:21:23.910
we're on route of B two to having the most violent year in Mexico as far as a

332
00:21:26.920 --> 00:21:29.560
cartel related deaths.
Right.
Um,

333
00:21:30.010 --> 00:21:34.630
when I got out do you want to had been on the top most dangerous cities on the

334
00:21:34.631 --> 00:21:38.710
planet list and I actually worked there when it was on the top and through

335
00:21:38.711 --> 00:21:41.410
efforts both for the,
from the government and,

336
00:21:41.470 --> 00:21:44.920
and through people like a Lieutenant Colonel Leyzaola,
uh,

337
00:21:45.010 --> 00:21:49.870
Tijuana was gone off the list of most dangerous cities in the world.

338
00:21:49.900 --> 00:21:53.560
And now it's again at number one,
right?
Yeah.
You sent me that.

339
00:21:53.561 --> 00:21:56.230
I was pretty shocked because you don't hear about that here.

340
00:21:56.410 --> 00:22:00.610
It's a six murders at night.
You know,
I was down there,

341
00:22:01.230 --> 00:22:03.250
uh,
two days ago and it was,

342
00:22:04.570 --> 00:22:06.730
it's a basically cartel on cartel,

343
00:22:06.970 --> 00:22:11.860
so they're cleaning each other out and just bodies appear in the morning,

344
00:22:11.861 --> 00:22:16.690
you know,
and um,
bridges hung from bridges,
um,
towards your shot.
You know,

345
00:22:16.720 --> 00:22:18.610
that's,
you know,
but again,
the,

346
00:22:19.310 --> 00:22:21.730
there's nobody's doing anything about it that should,
you know,

347
00:22:21.980 --> 00:22:24.790
but it's kind of turning a blind eye and a lot of ways.

348
00:22:27.490 --> 00:22:31.870
And so with this leftist president,
this guy who has this idea of amnesty,

349
00:22:32.630 --> 00:22:37.110
the people that are in charge of handling the cartel,
the,

350
00:22:37.111 --> 00:22:39.310
the military and the police officers,

351
00:22:39.760 --> 00:22:42.760
they've got to feel like a little abandoned.
Yeah.

352
00:22:42.940 --> 00:22:47.140
Or maybe some of them don't have a business plan and they're working at one
side.

353
00:22:47.330 --> 00:22:51.880
Um,
so that's a problem too.
Yeah.
So,
so to people that aren't aware,

354
00:22:52.090 --> 00:22:54.700
you know,
we have a separation of powers down there as well.

355
00:22:54.730 --> 00:22:59.730
So the army constitutionally shouldn't be engaging in combating the guardrails.

356
00:23:01.240 --> 00:23:02.950
They shouldn't be engaged in police roles.

357
00:23:02.951 --> 00:23:07.420
But there were some amendments done to the Constitution and laws passed.

358
00:23:08.080 --> 00:23:11.680
But you have to realize that some of these people that are fighting the cartels

359
00:23:11.681 --> 00:23:15.790
and the policing type role from the military,
uh,
some of them can't read,

360
00:23:16.210 --> 00:23:20.020
write or some of them come from rural parts of Mexico that shouldn't,

361
00:23:20.050 --> 00:23:23.350
they shouldn't be doing that type of activity.
So you get a lot of,
you know,

362
00:23:24.310 --> 00:23:27.490
a lot of failures on that side of the fence.

363
00:23:27.610 --> 00:23:32.610
We do have some high level SF community members in Mexico that are doing the

364
00:23:33.251 --> 00:23:37.690
work,
but they're few and far between.
And then you have the federal police,

365
00:23:38.350 --> 00:23:43.120
uh,
which has gone through about four or five name changes in the past,
you know,

366
00:23:43.150 --> 00:23:45.440
10 years,
because every time,
well,

367
00:23:45.441 --> 00:23:48.140
not going to call them that and change the uniform because they're all corrupt

368
00:23:48.510 --> 00:23:53.000
Jesus,
but now they're,
now they're this police.
Right.
So,
um,

369
00:23:53.510 --> 00:23:56.150
so they just change appearance.
They changed the name,
you know,

370
00:23:56.151 --> 00:24:00.920
but try to refresh the public opinion of it.
Yeah.
There was a famous,
uh,
uh,

371
00:24:00.980 --> 00:24:03.920
you know,
modern,
uh,
investigation,
federal investigation.

372
00:24:03.921 --> 00:24:08.921
Police called the coffee and they were like modern investigative federal police.

373
00:24:09.351 --> 00:24:13.610
It's going to go after.
And they were corrupt as hell,
you know,
and they,

374
00:24:13.611 --> 00:24:15.350
all they did was you don't get a name change.

375
00:24:15.350 --> 00:24:17.570
And all these guys got shuffled around and looking around and was like,
Hey,

376
00:24:17.571 --> 00:24:21.350
I know you like what?
I'm not,
no,
I'm,
I'm this now.
You know?

377
00:24:21.980 --> 00:24:25.130
But they're still the same person who compromise.
Yes.
Yeah.

378
00:24:25.250 --> 00:24:27.470
So those are the federal guys,
right?
Currently the,

379
00:24:27.471 --> 00:24:31.700
they want to do like a national,
a national police force and you're like,
wow,

380
00:24:31.701 --> 00:24:33.950
they're going to get new people that are going to be national police force.
No,

381
00:24:34.160 --> 00:24:36.620
it's the same guy.
She changed the uniform,
change your hat.

382
00:24:37.610 --> 00:24:41.910
So that's on the federal side,
you know.
So we're pretty,
you know,
wanting their,

383
00:24:42.040 --> 00:24:46.550
uh,
state side.
Each state has their own police force,
uh,
investigation,

384
00:24:46.551 --> 00:24:49.040
police force,
and a preventative type force.

385
00:24:49.670 --> 00:24:54.020
And these are politicized because each state government may be opposed to the

386
00:24:54.021 --> 00:24:55.370
federal government.
So there's a,

387
00:24:56.270 --> 00:25:01.270
there's some static there now and each municipality has its own police force and

388
00:25:01.761 --> 00:25:03.910
they meet,
it might be completely different,
uh,

389
00:25:03.950 --> 00:25:08.190
politically than these state and federal.
So
it must,

390
00:25:08.540 --> 00:25:13.540
for you to have your life on the line over there and see all this chaos and

391
00:25:13.611 --> 00:25:16.910
obvious the lack of organization or outright corruption,

392
00:25:16.940 --> 00:25:20.810
it must be insanely frustrating.
Yeah.
I mean,
well the uh,

393
00:25:21.140 --> 00:25:26.090
that'd be putting people in that were clearly,
uh,
guilty of things,

394
00:25:26.150 --> 00:25:26.983
you know,

395
00:25:27.080 --> 00:25:31.260
and then seeing them come out or the legal system down there that I got with

396
00:25:31.261 --> 00:25:33.170
that I had to endure.
You know,

397
00:25:33.171 --> 00:25:37.310
you would have to go and do a face to face with all these people,
right?

398
00:25:37.850 --> 00:25:40.100
Go into a Federal Court House,
leave your firearms behind,

399
00:25:40.160 --> 00:25:43.490
do a face to face with these people inside that you just got a,

400
00:25:43.510 --> 00:25:44.690
that you just got four,

401
00:25:45.410 --> 00:25:50.410
however many tons of cocaine or pot or whatever and then go outside and they're

402
00:25:50.661 --> 00:25:53.900
outside,
you know,
now,
now I know who you are.
You know,

403
00:25:54.440 --> 00:25:57.240
there's no anonymity in that,
in that regard to you.

404
00:25:57.400 --> 00:25:59.060
You would have to sign things,
you know,

405
00:26:00.050 --> 00:26:04.880
and then seeing some of the people that were with you working on your side and

406
00:26:04.881 --> 00:26:08.360
seeing how some of them would fall into corruption charges and then see what the

407
00:26:08.361 --> 00:26:09.890
government and then get your jobs back.

408
00:26:09.891 --> 00:26:13.880
But now you have somebody that's compromise within your own unit.
Wow.
All right.

409
00:26:13.881 --> 00:26:18.590
So they,
they did try a few things to try and clean out police forces.
Um,

410
00:26:18.770 --> 00:26:22.880
one of them was a planned,
they called,
uh,
the C3 plan.
It was like a,

411
00:26:23.660 --> 00:26:27.440
like a filter for police officers down there.
It's still in,
it's still an action,

412
00:26:27.680 --> 00:26:30.830
but you know,
it's questionable if it's effective or not.

413
00:26:31.040 --> 00:26:34.190
I saw a lot of people go through it and later on Hyundai would turn out to be

414
00:26:34.191 --> 00:26:37.640
cartel guys.
Basically.
They would do a background check,

415
00:26:38.000 --> 00:26:41.810
FBI background check,
a polygraph exam,
a drug testing,

416
00:26:42.950 --> 00:26:46.590
uh,
all the,
all of these things to see that you were,
you know,

417
00:26:46.591 --> 00:26:49.980
clean to work on these police forces.
Uh,

418
00:26:49.981 --> 00:26:54.210
the problem is that the polygraphs turned out to be unconstitutional to fire

419
00:26:54.211 --> 00:26:55.260
somebody over them.

420
00:26:55.560 --> 00:26:59.520
So a lot of these people got hired back after they would fail a polygraph basic

421
00:26:59.521 --> 00:27:04.410
polygraph exam.
So yeah,
again,
it's a lot of attempts to clean it up,

422
00:27:04.440 --> 00:27:07.950
you know,
and I,
you would be on the,

423
00:27:07.951 --> 00:27:10.260
on the level and all these people wouldn't be on the level,

424
00:27:10.320 --> 00:27:13.890
but they were still there.
So what percentage of people are not on the level?

425
00:27:13.891 --> 00:27:17.820
If you had to guess roughly.
I mean,
I would say it would depend.

426
00:27:18.000 --> 00:27:21.930
I'd say 30% problem.
That's a lot on,
on,

427
00:27:22.010 --> 00:27:25.140
on my experience of the people that I worked at.
30% weren't on them.

428
00:27:25.180 --> 00:27:29.820
You must cherish the 70.
Oh,
uh,
like family.
Yeah,
like family.

429
00:27:29.940 --> 00:27:32.640
Um,
and you,
you,
you,
you,
you,

430
00:27:32.700 --> 00:27:36.140
you would know when some of these people weren't on level.
Because,
you know,

431
00:27:36.150 --> 00:27:38.410
I have this running joke that I have this,
I,

432
00:27:38.500 --> 00:27:42.730
I went in with the same car that I drove out of the office with,
you know,

433
00:27:43.350 --> 00:27:47.310
a shitty truck that I had,
that I bought,

434
00:27:47.910 --> 00:27:52.680
that I bought when I,
uh,
you know,
about my own dime first truck,
first car,

435
00:27:53.130 --> 00:27:56.880
and I drove out of the office when they quit,
when I quit the job that same day,

436
00:27:56.920 --> 00:27:59.340
you know,
I,
I drove,
I drove out of the office and that truck,

437
00:28:00.180 --> 00:28:02.160
but a lot of these guys would come in with their,
you know,

438
00:28:02.190 --> 00:28:06.120
hummers and h shoes and just weird cars.
Will they go,
wait a minute,

439
00:28:06.150 --> 00:28:09.770
this doesn't make sense.
Like we are working the same office.

440
00:28:09.780 --> 00:28:14.700
Yt Yt you have a three story house.
So obvious though.
Prove it,

441
00:28:14.750 --> 00:28:19.470
you know?
Yeah.
But,
but the,
the obviousness of it,
oh yeah.
Blatant.

442
00:28:20.100 --> 00:28:23.340
You're driving a nice car,
living in a big house and everybody else was like,

443
00:28:23.341 --> 00:28:27.810
what?
Yeah.
Uh,
there's,
you know,
there's,
there's obviously these,
this,
that,

444
00:28:27.811 --> 00:28:30.780
these unwritten rules of,
and you know,
you won't,
you wouldn't tell on this guy,

445
00:28:30.840 --> 00:28:34.340
of course,
but you know,
it obvious.
Yeah.

446
00:28:34.440 --> 00:28:38.370
And when it came time to share information of a certain kind,

447
00:28:38.371 --> 00:28:42.630
or we're going to go over here and you would have to turn around and look around

448
00:28:42.631 --> 00:28:45.600
and see who was listening,
you know?
Yeah.

449
00:28:45.690 --> 00:28:49.530
You wouldn't trust a lot of these people.
So how are we gonna Power?

450
00:28:49.531 --> 00:28:52.140
We're going to do our job if we can't trust the people that are working with us.

451
00:28:53.270 --> 00:28:57.990
Well,
who was it that recently called for decriminalization?
They go,

452
00:28:58.020 --> 00:28:58.741
was it there,

453
00:28:58.741 --> 00:29:01.890
your president that called for the decriminalization of all drugs in America to

454
00:29:01.891 --> 00:29:03.780
go along with Mexico?
Is that what it was?
Yeah.

455
00:29:04.030 --> 00:29:07.740
Try to do something about the cartels.
Yeah.
We are on the brink of,

456
00:29:07.900 --> 00:29:10.710
of legalizing marijuana and in Mexico right now,

457
00:29:10.740 --> 00:29:14.400
like there's been a few landmark cases and you know,

458
00:29:14.401 --> 00:29:16.710
it's gold rush type situation right now.

459
00:29:16.711 --> 00:29:18.700
There's a lot of companies down there that get,

460
00:29:18.710 --> 00:29:21.900
that have had experienced up here.
They want to go down there.
Right.
Uh,

461
00:29:22.040 --> 00:29:25.740
so the culture is ready for it,
I think.
Do you think that would help?

462
00:29:26.190 --> 00:29:29.700
I don't know.
When it comes to legalizing pot up here,

463
00:29:30.090 --> 00:29:34.080
it hasn't helped down there as far as lowering things actually made things
worse.

464
00:29:34.230 --> 00:29:39.210
How's it made things worse?
Uh,
they changed,
they changed the,
uh,

465
00:29:39.240 --> 00:29:43.000
they changed what they were producing.
So that the ones you love,

466
00:29:43.210 --> 00:29:47.560
the reason why there's a heroin heroin epidemic up here and fentanyl epidemic up

467
00:29:47.561 --> 00:29:48.930
here,
uh,

468
00:29:48.940 --> 00:29:53.230
I think has some relationship with how things got legalized up here and how they

469
00:29:53.290 --> 00:29:55.660
switched,
um,
product down there.

470
00:29:56.140 --> 00:30:00.310
So a lighter colored heroin is coming down from Mexico.

471
00:30:00.311 --> 00:30:02.980
And I've seen [inaudible] I worked with law enforcement,
uh,

472
00:30:02.981 --> 00:30:06.280
up here in the u s uh,
doing classes and kind of,
you know,

473
00:30:06.520 --> 00:30:10.330
they send me things like,
what do you think about that?
Is that,
um,
and I've,

474
00:30:10.660 --> 00:30:14.290
I've seen that lighter colored heroin pop up in places as far off as your

475
00:30:14.291 --> 00:30:18.130
comments.
So,
you know,
because of the color.
Yeah,
the color,
the smell,

476
00:30:18.160 --> 00:30:18.881
the consistency.

477
00:30:18.881 --> 00:30:23.020
You can kind of tell if it's Asian or how it will cause a different strain.

478
00:30:23.050 --> 00:30:23.820
Like it's,

479
00:30:23.820 --> 00:30:27.070
it's a probably a different strain and it's also the amount of sun it gets in

480
00:30:27.071 --> 00:30:30.100
the region where it's going to be in grown as high at higher altitude.

481
00:30:30.760 --> 00:30:33.670
So it's lighter color,
not as stinky,
I dunno.
Um,

482
00:30:33.700 --> 00:30:35.940
but I think it's a relationship that,

483
00:30:35.941 --> 00:30:38.830
that kind of relates to the legalization issue down there.

484
00:30:38.860 --> 00:30:43.420
They didn't affect them in the pockets.
They just switched the product.

485
00:30:43.450 --> 00:30:44.051
It's gotta be,

486
00:30:44.051 --> 00:30:47.890
it's such a strange relationship because the reason why these drug cartels have

487
00:30:47.891 --> 00:30:51.870
so much power because they're selling drugs to the United States.
Yeah.

488
00:30:51.910 --> 00:30:56.910
So it's like you have this connection to this country that has this great big

489
00:30:57.011 --> 00:30:59.860
wall that it wants to build.
And on one side,

490
00:30:59.861 --> 00:31:02.350
everybody's buying up all the illegal drugs and the other side,

491
00:31:02.351 --> 00:31:05.820
everyone's killing everybody to try to make and sell these illegal drugs.
Yeah.

492
00:31:05.980 --> 00:31:10.450
I mean,
and there's a lot of holes underneath that.
A wall and,
uh,
drones,

493
00:31:11.200 --> 00:31:14.380
drone technology is that we're all going to help anything.
Well,

494
00:31:14.410 --> 00:31:17.950
the walls already been up for a few years.
Part of it.

495
00:31:18.080 --> 00:31:22.000
And in place like the [inaudible],
which is like one of the richest truck routes,

496
00:31:22.001 --> 00:31:25.720
routes on the planet.
And it's the drugs that cost the same,
you know,

497
00:31:25.990 --> 00:31:29.260
it's the same.
It's,
yeah.
And what about like the ocean?

498
00:31:29.330 --> 00:31:32.290
Can't they just take a boat?
Uh,
I've,

499
00:31:32.350 --> 00:31:37.350
I've seen one large submarine in my time working real large,

500
00:31:37.700 --> 00:31:42.670
like,
like military science,
uh,
like,
uh,
like scientific size.

501
00:31:42.671 --> 00:31:46.630
Where the fuck does somebody buy on submarine online?
Apparently.
Really?
Yeah.

502
00:31:46.690 --> 00:31:50.410
You can buy a submarine can buy a small submarine for a small amount of money.

503
00:31:50.440 --> 00:31:54.220
I think the main part of the summary and ownership is maintained maintenance.

504
00:31:54.730 --> 00:31:58.330
That was the reason we found it is that it wasn't properly maintained.

505
00:31:58.331 --> 00:32:02.650
So it a sunk.
He uh,
it,
uh,
it actually,
no,

506
00:32:02.651 --> 00:32:07.090
it actually floated,
couldn't sink.
Oh.
And it had a bunch of things.
Hanging off

507
00:32:08.710 --> 00:32:11.800
summaries scare the shit out of me.
You can't see where you're going.
Well,

508
00:32:13.570 --> 00:32:16.120
so yeah,
I've seen submarines,
uh,
drones,

509
00:32:16.450 --> 00:32:19.210
like a squadron of drones with a bunch of loads on it.
Wow.

510
00:32:19.660 --> 00:32:21.610
How heavy can a drone get?
Still fly?

511
00:32:22.420 --> 00:32:25.720
I've types I've seen for like two kilos on it.
Really?
Yeah.

512
00:32:27.960 --> 00:32:31.920
So just fly in the coke over the top.
Yeah.
The only reason we,

513
00:32:31.990 --> 00:32:36.370
I found out about those,
one of those crashed,
uh,
in a,
in a,

514
00:32:36.371 --> 00:32:38.410
an a roadside next to the border fence.

515
00:32:38.800 --> 00:32:43.800
Were you around when that CIA drug plane crashed in Mexico with tons of cocaine

516
00:32:45.171 --> 00:32:49.370
on it?
I wasn't there,
but I was aware of that situation.

517
00:32:49.400 --> 00:32:53.810
What the fuck is that about?
I mean,
realistically,
uh,

518
00:32:54.080 --> 00:32:58.320
there's,
there's a lot of Americans running around in Mexico.
Yeah.
That's,
that's,

519
00:32:58.380 --> 00:33:02.390
that's it.
There's a lot of cowboys,
right?
Yeah.
A lot of people say,
listen,

520
00:33:02.420 --> 00:33:06.620
we just make this one run.
Like the government doesn't give a fuck about us.

521
00:33:06.621 --> 00:33:11.380
My pension sucks.
It could be,
you know,
every now and then,
you know,

522
00:33:11.390 --> 00:33:13.250
and this is,
this is,
this isn't a secret.

523
00:33:13.880 --> 00:33:17.390
Every now and then you would see a dude out there that's blonde,

524
00:33:17.391 --> 00:33:21.470
tall and has a bunch of tattoos that don't belong down there working on the

525
00:33:21.500 --> 00:33:26.140
military side of things in Mexico or some dudes doing something,

526
00:33:26.160 --> 00:33:28.790
some place in your [inaudible] that you would get a call,
you know.
Oh they're,

527
00:33:28.791 --> 00:33:33.420
they're fine.
Just,
you know,
just leave him alone.
So who knows?
You know,

528
00:33:33.470 --> 00:33:37.340
who knows.
So if it's three out of 10 were corrupt,
where you,

529
00:33:37.341 --> 00:33:41.720
where it might be like one out of 10?
I have no idea.
You guys.

530
00:33:41.820 --> 00:33:45.590
I mean,
uh,
you know,
uh,
usually we would get to,

531
00:33:45.800 --> 00:33:50.160
since I have a pretty good,
you spoken English,
I would get a,

532
00:33:50.900 --> 00:33:55.670
I will get sent places for training or for liaison work with some people that

533
00:33:55.671 --> 00:33:58.490
would go down there and I would never know what the hell some of these people

534
00:33:58.491 --> 00:34:03.140
were from,
you know,
so who knows,
you know,
it seems like it's very loose.

535
00:34:03.230 --> 00:34:06.310
Like there's a lot of room for fuckery,
uh,

536
00:34:07.080 --> 00:34:11.990
Calderon era and Bush administration era.
It,
there was a lot of,

537
00:34:12.320 --> 00:34:17.210
there was a lot of stuff going on.
Uh,
Obama Administration era after,

538
00:34:17.211 --> 00:34:21.560
uh,
the whole fast and furious thing,
things kind of went dark for a while,

539
00:34:21.680 --> 00:34:22.513
explained the fee.

540
00:34:22.530 --> 00:34:25.610
A lot of people don't know what the fast and furious series it was a the,

541
00:34:25.880 --> 00:34:30.880
it's sold guns to the cartel under the guise that this is the way they would

542
00:34:31.371 --> 00:34:35.420
track the guns.
Yes.
It seems so fishy.
Oh,

543
00:34:35.980 --> 00:34:40.980
I learned about it from CNN and I,

544
00:34:41.730 --> 00:34:44.930
a few of my friends were killed with some of those guns down there,
which is,

545
00:34:45.290 --> 00:34:47.000
you know,
everybody talks about the,

546
00:34:47.720 --> 00:34:50.450
the u s agent that was in Mexico has killed by some of these guns.

547
00:34:50.451 --> 00:34:51.500
But there was a lot of,
you know,

548
00:34:51.680 --> 00:34:55.580
Mexican agents and people civilians killed by these guns as well.

549
00:34:55.610 --> 00:34:57.690
So there were very specific types of guns,
you know,

550
00:34:57.691 --> 00:35:02.000
so like imagine somebody giving you a shopping list about the types of guns you

551
00:35:02.001 --> 00:35:05.360
want.
Right.
Including In these lists were 50,
cal Barrett,

552
00:35:05.361 --> 00:35:09.980
Gus Barrett rifles and fn five sevens,
which are a very,
it's a,

553
00:35:09.981 --> 00:35:14.981
it's a pistol with a very high velocity round that goes through a soft armor.

554
00:35:16.460 --> 00:35:19.670
Like the type of stuff that was issued to us.
All right.

555
00:35:19.671 --> 00:35:23.540
So all of a sudden we were seeing these space best tools in the hands of the

556
00:35:23.541 --> 00:35:26.090
cartels and very specific parts of the country.
And we're like,

557
00:35:26.800 --> 00:35:30.110
but what a preposterous idea that they're going to sell it to the cartel track

558
00:35:30.111 --> 00:35:33.350
of track them.
Well,
that sounds like horse shit to me.

559
00:35:33.351 --> 00:35:36.710
That sounds like someone was trying to make money and they said,
oh,
well,
just,
uh,

560
00:35:36.730 --> 00:35:40.430
say we're selling it to them to track it.
Well,
the,
the,
the,
the,

561
00:35:40.440 --> 00:35:44.130
the suspicious part is that all of them went to the one specific cartel that's

562
00:35:44.140 --> 00:35:48.690
seen the law cartel.
So it sounds like such horseshit.
The fact that,

563
00:35:48.960 --> 00:35:52.350
I mean,
who went to jail for that?
Eric Holder didn't go to jail.
He should have,

564
00:35:52.800 --> 00:35:57.200
he should have.
He should have,
I mean,
there's,
there's blood,
you know,
people died.

565
00:35:57.290 --> 00:36:01.950
Uh,
there was,
uh,
an,
I can't say the name,
uh,
but somewhere in,

566
00:36:01.951 --> 00:36:06.840
uh,
in Baja,
a little girl lost her arm.
Uh,

567
00:36:06.841 --> 00:36:10.590
an agent that was a friend of mine got killed and the wife got killed with

568
00:36:10.591 --> 00:36:14.610
[inaudible] that are directly related to that whole thing.
Right.

569
00:36:14.670 --> 00:36:18.390
So you can go to jail for fucking tax evasion and this guy can get away with

570
00:36:18.391 --> 00:36:20.060
that.
Uh,
the,

571
00:36:20.061 --> 00:36:24.510
the idea that you would run that by people and they would go,
yeah,
good idea.

572
00:36:24.960 --> 00:36:27.700
Yeah.
Give them gun.
And to be clear,
I don't know the,

573
00:36:27.701 --> 00:36:31.320
the realities of that operation on this side.
People say there was,
it was a,

574
00:36:31.360 --> 00:36:35.190
it was happening way before.
All I know is that when that happened,

575
00:36:35.191 --> 00:36:36.090
nobody told us.

576
00:36:36.300 --> 00:36:41.190
And there was definitely some weird resentment on part of the government down

577
00:36:41.191 --> 00:36:45.420
there and some people down there as far as you know.
And,
and uh,

578
00:36:45.450 --> 00:36:48.840
there was some weird conspiracy theories going on as well down there.

579
00:36:48.860 --> 00:36:50.130
How could there not be?
Yeah.

580
00:36:50.160 --> 00:36:53.560
I mean that seems like it's conspiracy theory right in front of your face.
Yeah.

581
00:36:54.050 --> 00:36:55.140
Did the fact,
Oh yeah,

582
00:36:55.141 --> 00:36:59.190
we just sold them to trucks or the guns so that we could track.
Um,
yeah,

583
00:36:59.760 --> 00:37:01.980
no one's going to die.
It's not like a bad idea.

584
00:37:02.100 --> 00:37:05.670
The main thing you would hear is that people will them in fast and furious.

585
00:37:05.700 --> 00:37:09.030
Executive privilege law suit between Doj and house

586
00:37:10.670 --> 00:37:12.900
are wrapped up with in the last two weeks,

587
00:37:12.901 --> 00:37:17.250
I guess really this is just wrapping up some settlement.
Wow.

588
00:37:17.280 --> 00:37:20.310
Cause this is from,
what,
nine years ago?
10 years ago at least.

589
00:37:20.311 --> 00:37:24.820
And the guns are still showing up,
so I don't know how many of them they,
I don't,

590
00:37:24.870 --> 00:37:29.770
I've never known what numbers,
but
last time we found some,

591
00:37:29.771 --> 00:37:33.270
and I,
I have,
I actually have a images of the ones we found.

592
00:37:33.480 --> 00:37:37.470
They were buried in somebody's backyard inside of a,
uh,
a water barrel.

593
00:37:38.280 --> 00:37:43.230
And all of them were obviously us origin guns.
And they're like,

594
00:37:43.260 --> 00:37:48.180
well what do you mean?
Uh,
all of them had very specific,
uh,

595
00:37:48.181 --> 00:37:53.100
accessories on them that nobody else in the world puts these accessories on

596
00:37:53.101 --> 00:37:56.340
their guns at us because they're pretty ridiculous accessories.

597
00:37:56.341 --> 00:38:00.870
Like what kind of accessories?
Um,
things that had things,
uh,

598
00:38:00.930 --> 00:38:01.621
letters on them,

599
00:38:01.621 --> 00:38:06.621
like a see you in hell type things on the petitioner's punishers calls,

600
00:38:06.740 --> 00:38:09.250
punish your skulls of the big one.
Right?
Yeah.
Uh,

601
00:38:09.570 --> 00:38:14.570
and that is hilarious that a cartoon skull has from a marvel comic book cause

602
00:38:14.761 --> 00:38:19.140
become a gigantic part of SPEC ops.
Yeah,
it is.
It is pretty ridiculous.

603
00:38:19.320 --> 00:38:22.620
Well,
the main room or down there like conspiracy theory wise,

604
00:38:23.070 --> 00:38:26.040
and you would hear all sorts of things,
you know,
uh,
because down there there's,

605
00:38:26.520 --> 00:38:29.940
there's no such thing as top secret clearance in Mexico.
You know,
there's like,

606
00:38:30.120 --> 00:38:34.410
there's like,
Hey,
don't say anything.
That's about it,
you know?
Uh,

607
00:38:34.411 --> 00:38:37.100
so you'd hear crazy,
crazy things.
Uh,

608
00:38:37.210 --> 00:38:40.710
main thing was that the US was planning an invasion.
You know,
they're,

609
00:38:40.770 --> 00:38:44.530
they're destabilizing the region so they could put boots on the ground.
Oh,
Jesus.

610
00:38:44.550 --> 00:38:45.900
You know,
that was the,
the,
the,

611
00:38:45.930 --> 00:38:50.330
like a Colin conspiracy theory going on to us invading Mexico.
Yeah.

612
00:38:50.440 --> 00:38:54.680
How fucking crazy would that be?
Well,
you know,
uh,
uh,

613
00:38:54.940 --> 00:38:59.740
as far as,
uh,
a reaction on the side of Mexico,
uh,
people aren't here then.

614
00:38:59.741 --> 00:39:04.450
This is,
again,
this is purely speculation and weird rumors that I would hear,

615
00:39:04.950 --> 00:39:09.250
uh,
people were planning to do poison drug loads on that side,
uh,

616
00:39:09.251 --> 00:39:12.750
to create a health crisis in dos as a reaction.
Uh,

617
00:39:13.570 --> 00:39:14.410
that was pretty,

618
00:39:14.411 --> 00:39:17.200
like when I heard it's like little league who was talking about this yet,

619
00:39:17.201 --> 00:39:21.330
you know,
uh,
and so full out war almost could be,
you know,
uh,

620
00:39:21.340 --> 00:39:23.860
and then you would try to see,
well,
who's doing that?
And the cartels.

621
00:39:23.861 --> 00:39:27.020
So the cartels are the government at the same thing.
Like what's going on.
Right,

622
00:39:27.021 --> 00:39:30.790
right,
right.
And again,
this is just weird stuff.
You,
what occurred,

623
00:39:30.920 --> 00:39:32.530
this is a crazy perspective,
right?

624
00:39:32.590 --> 00:39:37.590
The cartels would poison the drugs to punish the Americans for the military

625
00:39:39.491 --> 00:39:43.270
invading the country.
Yeah.
Yeah.
[inaudible] to create a,

626
00:39:43.360 --> 00:39:48.340
to create a health crisis in the u s so they would,
you know,
have to go back.
Wow.

627
00:39:48.360 --> 00:39:52.960
That,
I mean,
not the rumors.
You know,
how many guns they brought over a,

628
00:39:53.020 --> 00:39:56.470
I've heard all sorts of numbers.
We never got told the same as going number.

629
00:39:56.590 --> 00:40:01.590
Nearly 2000 firearms were illegally purchased for 1.5 million according to the

630
00:40:02.531 --> 00:40:07.340
DOJ inspector general report.
Fuck.
Hundreds of guns related recovery.

631
00:40:07.360 --> 00:40:09.240
The United States and Mexico.
Yeah.

632
00:40:09.820 --> 00:40:13.960
Ma 50 cows were so the,
the,
it's,

633
00:40:13.980 --> 00:40:17.980
and it's always an escalation with the cartels.
Right.
So the,
we,

634
00:40:18.010 --> 00:40:22.980
they would get a AK 47 and we would get a German main g three's that were saying

635
00:40:23.920 --> 00:40:26.380
around the same caliber and we could fight back.
Right.

636
00:40:27.070 --> 00:40:30.640
And then all of our leadership started rolling around in armored vehicles.

637
00:40:30.641 --> 00:40:35.530
So let's get 50 cals to,
you know,
make holes in these armored vehicles.

638
00:40:35.531 --> 00:40:39.550
So,
so it was all,
it's always been an escalation.
Now this is crazy.

639
00:40:39.600 --> 00:40:42.850
You guys were getting 50 cows so you could shoot holes in the armored vehicles.

640
00:40:43.230 --> 00:40:46.260
Yeah,
the,
so the cartels were getting them first and then,
uh,

641
00:40:46.340 --> 00:40:49.460
then we had to get them because they were rolling around in our vehicle.

642
00:40:49.461 --> 00:40:54.400
So that Mad Max hype,
armored vehicles they would make,
they would first,

643
00:40:54.430 --> 00:40:59.430
first day would make them like homemade madmax armored vehicles.
Uh,

644
00:40:59.600 --> 00:41:02.200
uh,
they,
they found a few of their online somewhere.

645
00:41:02.290 --> 00:41:04.930
One of them was called [inaudible],
which is like a giant.

646
00:41:05.280 --> 00:41:08.320
They all that all that was missing with the guy with the guitar on the back of

647
00:41:08.321 --> 00:41:13.090
it,
you know,
like my Max.
Um,
and they would use these to roll into town and like,

648
00:41:13.230 --> 00:41:15.220
how would you fight that?
You know?
Right.

649
00:41:15.280 --> 00:41:20.080
And then we had to get a 50 cow or we'll get the military to shoot them from the

650
00:41:20.081 --> 00:41:21.910
sky.
Oh my God.
Yeah.
There's a,

651
00:41:21.911 --> 00:41:25.270
there's a famous video from somewhere down in Mexico where they shoot a Vulcan,

652
00:41:25.390 --> 00:41:30.250
a rifle down at a cartel member and the card number vehicle.
But then you'd see,

653
00:41:30.251 --> 00:41:34.370
well,
you know,
well,
uh,
checkmate,
checkmate.
Government against the cartel.

654
00:41:34.970 --> 00:41:38.720
But then you realize that the cartels like the new generation cocktail in

655
00:41:38.721 --> 00:41:43.721
Guadalajara actually downed helicopters in Walla Hora military helicopters

656
00:41:43.731 --> 00:41:48.310
because they have antiaircraft capabilities.
Jesus Christ.
So that then you,

657
00:41:48.311 --> 00:41:53.270
now you're like checkmate cartels,
you know,
that's,
that's how,
where does this go?

658
00:41:54.200 --> 00:41:57.510
Like where,
where,
I mean,
how far does it escalate?
I,
that's,
that's the,

659
00:41:57.511 --> 00:42:00.410
that's the thing that,
you know,
you,
you have to think about the,

660
00:42:00.590 --> 00:42:03.260
so killing and death is not

661
00:42:05.030 --> 00:42:09.350
at the industrial level.
It's that is being done in Mexico,

662
00:42:09.351 --> 00:42:13.760
not just killing,
but,
you know,
disappearing bodies,
making body disappear.
Uh,

663
00:42:13.761 --> 00:42:18.650
I was,
uh,
I was,
uh,
I was around when they got the,
the stew maker,

664
00:42:19.700 --> 00:42:22.010
the stew maker was a guy,
uh,

665
00:42:22.011 --> 00:42:24.920
that worked for the senior level cartel in Tijuana,

666
00:42:25.700 --> 00:42:29.750
and he would get rid of bodies using caustic soda.
All right.

667
00:42:30.230 --> 00:42:34.070
So he would get bodies every night and he had these basically these industrial

668
00:42:34.071 --> 00:42:38.390
level,
just barrels of it just going into caustic soda.
It's a chemical mixture.

669
00:42:38.510 --> 00:42:41.180
Yeah.
You can get most of the components at a hardware store,

670
00:42:41.270 --> 00:42:45.250
basically a dissolves bodies,
you know,
they would get,
get some of this,

671
00:42:45.251 --> 00:42:48.690
a mixture he said in interviews,
uh,

672
00:42:48.860 --> 00:42:52.040
that he got trained by Israelis that how to do that.

673
00:42:52.040 --> 00:42:55.970
So who knows if that's true or not.
But in the night he said he would get rid of,

674
00:42:55.971 --> 00:43:00.320
you know,
dozens of bodies and this gets rid of everything,
you know,

675
00:43:00.980 --> 00:43:03.110
DNA,
bone,
everything.

676
00:43:03.440 --> 00:43:06.590
So there was a lot of families on Mexico that are looking for their kids for

677
00:43:06.591 --> 00:43:11.270
years and there's just no way of giving them a body.
Um,

678
00:43:12.140 --> 00:43:15.920
and the amount of youth that goes into cartel working just gets,
you know,

679
00:43:15.950 --> 00:43:20.600
killed there.
And it's just,
it's a whole generations and whole towns,

680
00:43:20.750 --> 00:43:25.040
uh,
of women and old men,
you know,

681
00:43:25.070 --> 00:43:28.310
they're out there now,
which is like coal generation is just God,
you know,

682
00:43:28.311 --> 00:43:29.970
all the men in gone.

683
00:43:30.120 --> 00:43:35.120
I've gone to gone to a few small towns where like they looked at me like youth,

684
00:43:36.260 --> 00:43:37.320
you know,
young man.

685
00:43:37.790 --> 00:43:42.260
So it's rare at some places that is because of the men are all getting killed or

686
00:43:42.261 --> 00:43:44.750
getting God,
God,
God in the uh,
you know,

687
00:43:45.650 --> 00:43:49.160
in the cartel operations and killed or you're recruited,
you know,

688
00:43:49.200 --> 00:43:51.830
forcibly recruited or voluntarily recruited,

689
00:43:51.831 --> 00:43:53.630
but you don't hold generations just wiped out.

690
00:43:53.750 --> 00:43:55.400
Now the people in your line of work,

691
00:43:55.401 --> 00:43:58.190
the people that are boots on the ground who really understand the problem,

692
00:43:59.300 --> 00:44:02.750
what is the thought in terms of what could be done to fix this?

693
00:44:04.670 --> 00:44:07.970
I think a main thing is any sort of,
uh,
any sort of plan,

694
00:44:09.080 --> 00:44:13.820
any sort of plan to fight the cartels that involves just a six year plan won't

695
00:44:13.821 --> 00:44:17.450
work because that's what,
that's what the main problem has been with Mexico.

696
00:44:17.990 --> 00:44:22.460
Each president of your presidential
terms,
six years.

697
00:44:22.461 --> 00:44:24.770
Each president comes in with a six year plan.

698
00:44:25.790 --> 00:44:30.790
He either does very good or does really bad and then it gets forgotten and

699
00:44:31.621 --> 00:44:34.500
another one comes in.
And,
uh,

700
00:44:34.501 --> 00:44:39.501
there's also definitely an addiction to money from the u s side of four car

701
00:44:39.680 --> 00:44:43.170
counter and cartel operations.
Uh,
there's a,
uh,
plan Mary that it's called.

702
00:44:43.171 --> 00:44:48.171
It's a international plan where the u s pays for a count on narcotics type

703
00:44:48.481 --> 00:44:49.950
operations in,
in,
in Mexico.

704
00:44:49.950 --> 00:44:53.130
So there's an addiction to that money on the side of the government.

705
00:44:53.131 --> 00:44:56.270
So there's a lot of interest for that to keep going,
you know,

706
00:44:56.430 --> 00:44:59.670
so they don't want to resolve the problem as much as they want to in some ways,

707
00:44:59.671 --> 00:45:02.720
you know,
you know,
um,
they,
they,

708
00:45:02.730 --> 00:45:07.050
they refuse to professionalize the police horses down there.
Uh,

709
00:45:07.051 --> 00:45:10.260
they don't put enough effort in that,
in that regard.
You know,

710
00:45:10.290 --> 00:45:11.870
good people that are there that I've,

711
00:45:11.880 --> 00:45:16.470
I know there's some amazing guys down there doing amazing work,
uh,

712
00:45:16.510 --> 00:45:19.350
and they get passed up for promotion because they don't,
they don't have any,

713
00:45:19.351 --> 00:45:21.100
they don't know anybody high level.
Uh,

714
00:45:21.101 --> 00:45:24.480
they don't work for either side of the game.
You know,

715
00:45:24.810 --> 00:45:27.390
so a lot of these people just get cast aside,
you know,

716
00:45:28.200 --> 00:45:33.060
and uh,
you know,
it's kind of hopeless in that regard.
You know,

717
00:45:33.090 --> 00:45:37.980
a lot,
a lot of the good guys when they get,
when they come out of the job,

718
00:45:37.981 --> 00:45:42.360
there's only a few options to them.
Right.
Um,
I had,
I had options,

719
00:45:42.361 --> 00:45:44.130
but in a lot of the guys that go out of job Dome,

720
00:45:44.160 --> 00:45:47.710
so they get recruited by the cartels.
All right.

721
00:45:47.830 --> 00:45:52.530
Did anybody ever attempt to recruit you?
Yeah.
Yeah.
You get offers?
No.
You get off.

722
00:45:53.730 --> 00:45:57.780
Um,
there's a,
there's a famous,
uh,
uh,

723
00:45:57.810 --> 00:46:02.340
there's a famous called [inaudible],
which is like a Mexican folk folk song,
uh,

724
00:46:02.370 --> 00:46:05.010
called,
uh,
I'm going to talk about my past.
Right.

725
00:46:05.580 --> 00:46:08.460
And it's a pretty interesting songs about a cartel guy that used to work as a

726
00:46:08.461 --> 00:46:11.130
cop.
And then somebody from his past approaches them and says,

727
00:46:11.131 --> 00:46:14.280
you want the kids haven't done on college?
You want to,
you want to do a job,

728
00:46:14.360 --> 00:46:16.350
you know,
that's what you would get.
You know,

729
00:46:16.351 --> 00:46:19.530
people within the police force is asking you what you want to,

730
00:46:19.560 --> 00:46:24.540
you want to work on the side.
That was the entry,
you know,
and,

731
00:46:24.780 --> 00:46:29.490
or you know,
we'll pay you this much.
What does it like when you say no?

732
00:46:30.620 --> 00:46:34.680
Uh,
it's pretty,
it's pretty hard.
It's uh,
it's not,
it's not,

733
00:46:34.740 --> 00:46:38.010
it's not specifically saying no,
but just saying,

734
00:46:38.040 --> 00:46:40.980
I'm not the one to ask for this.
And you say,
you know,

735
00:46:40.981 --> 00:46:43.720
I'm not the one that asked for this.
You know what,
I'm,
I'm,
I'm,

736
00:46:43.740 --> 00:46:47.610
I'm only in this for the money,
for my paycheck and you know,

737
00:46:47.611 --> 00:46:51.750
I don't want to risk anything.
So,
and how do they leave that?
They don't,

738
00:46:51.780 --> 00:46:53.490
then they're not happy usually,
you know?

739
00:46:53.520 --> 00:46:57.090
So if you get on a list sometimes and you know something that follows you,

740
00:46:57.660 --> 00:46:59.880
but it's in a much better thing than actually going,

741
00:46:59.910 --> 00:47:03.990
getting into one of these guys pockets,
you know,
once you take something,

742
00:47:04.180 --> 00:47:08.610
you're theirs.
Right.
Like the mom,
like the mom,
you know,
a lot of things.

743
00:47:08.940 --> 00:47:11.750
It's a lot of these guys actually took,
but you know,
they,

744
00:47:11.770 --> 00:47:13.860
they have a lot of these cartels down there.

745
00:47:13.890 --> 00:47:18.840
They kind of venerate the whole gangster era in the US.
It's like a thing.
Oh,

746
00:47:18.930 --> 00:47:22.020
so it's like a thing they looked up like look up to,
you know.
Right.

747
00:47:22.380 --> 00:47:24.240
So like you see a lot of a gold plated,

748
00:47:24.241 --> 00:47:27.360
a Thompson machine guns down nurses take picture with him.

749
00:47:28.020 --> 00:47:29.590
So there's a,

750
00:47:29.990 --> 00:47:33.450
a lack of professionalizing the police force.
Yes.

751
00:47:33.490 --> 00:47:36.820
And that you think is a conscious effort?
I think.
I think it's a,

752
00:47:37.060 --> 00:47:40.360
so we keep them fairly incompetent.
I think.
So,
you know,

753
00:47:40.430 --> 00:47:44.530
a lot of ways we w we were,
we were,
uh,
as a group,

754
00:47:44.610 --> 00:47:47.290
the group that I used to work with,
uh,
we,

755
00:47:47.380 --> 00:47:50.920
there was a lot of efforts to professionalize us to like getting,

756
00:47:51.010 --> 00:47:55.790
getting that career path to actually being,
um,
you know,
making an a,

757
00:47:55.830 --> 00:48:00.310
a career.
There's no,
right now where I used to work,
there was no pension.

758
00:48:00.730 --> 00:48:03.100
No,
there's no retiring.
Wow.
Uh,

759
00:48:03.490 --> 00:48:07.390
if you want to get any sort of a credit for anything,
the credit,

760
00:48:07.450 --> 00:48:11.710
the credit companies won't even touch you because you're too high risk,
you know,

761
00:48:11.870 --> 00:48:15.250
you too high risks cause you might get shot.
Yeah.
Wow.

762
00:48:15.280 --> 00:48:19.420
Well it is the most dangerous city on the planet.
All right.
So,
so they,

763
00:48:19.421 --> 00:48:23.860
they wouldn't touch us.
Um,
and realistically,

764
00:48:24.070 --> 00:48:28.600
culturally being a cop in Mexico is,
you know,

765
00:48:30.070 --> 00:48:31.410
male porn actor,

766
00:48:31.480 --> 00:48:35.740
cop or probably along the same range as far as shame,
you know.

767
00:48:35.920 --> 00:48:38.770
Wow.
Yeah.
Uh,
W I,
I,

768
00:48:38.771 --> 00:48:41.920
we wouldn't eat at any restaurant that we didn't know the people,
you know,

769
00:48:41.930 --> 00:48:44.350
because it would spit in their faces a lot of,
yeah.

770
00:48:44.351 --> 00:48:47.400
There's hate and I was hate or by,
by the hate cops,

771
00:48:47.401 --> 00:48:51.790
how much they like a,
as a,
as a culture in Mexico,

772
00:48:52.330 --> 00:48:54.970
police,
police,
cultural Mexico has earned it.
You know,

773
00:48:55.060 --> 00:48:59.740
a lot of guys working both sides.
A lot of guys being,
uh,
you know,

774
00:48:59.950 --> 00:49:02.440
um,
again,
the whole,
uh,

775
00:49:02.750 --> 00:49:06.250
you're going to be a cop because you know somebody in there and the people that

776
00:49:06.251 --> 00:49:09.740
shouldn't be in any sort of public service.
Uh,

777
00:49:10.210 --> 00:49:12.580
so there's a lot of corruption.
Again,
a lot of corruption,
a lot of,

778
00:49:12.610 --> 00:49:17.590
a lot of things done wrongly by the cops,
a lot of abuses,
you know,

779
00:49:17.591 --> 00:49:21.580
a lot of human rights violation type situations.
So it's earned,
you know,

780
00:49:21.790 --> 00:49:26.790
so the big shift over there in terms of crime turns with cartel crime occurs

781
00:49:27.310 --> 00:49:30.760
first with September 11th,
tightening of the borders.

782
00:49:31.270 --> 00:49:36.070
Then it starts to ramp up after that because of what,

783
00:49:36.460 --> 00:49:41.020
uh,
the,
the government first started,
uh,
targeting certain,
uh,

784
00:49:41.050 --> 00:49:44.470
cartel heads.
You cut one head off Hydra,

785
00:49:45.450 --> 00:49:48.520
two headphones who had three heads pop up,
power vacuum,

786
00:49:48.550 --> 00:49:53.110
our vacuum bill fight to try to gain power.
You know,
like the cartels realize,

787
00:49:53.111 --> 00:49:54.060
you know what,
yeah,

788
00:49:55.450 --> 00:49:59.710
that we are standing on the richest drug routes on the planet,

789
00:50:00.130 --> 00:50:04.420
so we should probably,
you know,
start fighting over him.
Yeah.

790
00:50:04.510 --> 00:50:09.250
And also what also what happened is that,
you know,
a lot of these people,

791
00:50:09.330 --> 00:50:12.820
it's something that people,
Americans kind of don't have,
don't get yet.

792
00:50:13.420 --> 00:50:15.460
This isn't a Mexican problem anymore.

793
00:50:15.490 --> 00:50:18.160
Specifically as far as the cartel violence going on.

794
00:50:18.820 --> 00:50:22.570
A lot of these people have their kids up here in the US in the 90s.

795
00:50:22.750 --> 00:50:26.550
A lot of these cartel guys,
you know,
it'll chapel has kids,
had kids in Dos,

796
00:50:27.710 --> 00:50:32.150
and a lot of these people are now coming of age,
you know,
um,

797
00:50:32.750 --> 00:50:36.680
so cartel influence in the u s is a thing you're going to start seeing if you're

798
00:50:36.681 --> 00:50:37.491
already seeing it,

799
00:50:37.491 --> 00:50:40.550
but you're going to see more of it because a lot of these people are actually

800
00:50:40.580 --> 00:50:45.580
American born US citizens now working in tandem with any sort of interest down

801
00:50:47.781 --> 00:50:51.890
there.
So,
oh,
that's going to be the new shift,
you know,
and uh,

802
00:50:52.790 --> 00:50:53.270
you know,
people,

803
00:50:53.270 --> 00:50:56.240
people are sometimes kind of horrified by some of the stuff that I post up.

804
00:50:56.241 --> 00:50:57.290
Some of the cases down there,

805
00:50:57.980 --> 00:51:01.980
people can look up the [inaudible] gang in,

806
00:51:02.040 --> 00:51:05.870
in southern California,
there were actual cartel,

807
00:51:05.960 --> 00:51:10.960
a group that would kidnap people in the u s dressed as federal agents in the u s

808
00:51:12.230 --> 00:51:13.790
and dragged them back down to Mexico.

809
00:51:14.210 --> 00:51:17.570
Now this has happened a few book almost I think in like nine years back.

810
00:51:18.140 --> 00:51:22.070
But this is happening to you who knew us?
No,
it's not something foreign anymore.

811
00:51:22.430 --> 00:51:24.170
You know,
a lot of people want to think that you will,

812
00:51:24.200 --> 00:51:29.120
you can build a wall and keep all that down.
Don't get me wrong.

813
00:51:29.240 --> 00:51:31.670
People build that wall.
I have nothing against it.

814
00:51:31.850 --> 00:51:35.810
But selling it as a security thing,
uh,
just,
I don't,

815
00:51:35.811 --> 00:51:38.360
I don't think it makes that much sense in a lot of,

816
00:51:38.390 --> 00:51:42.410
in a lot of the parts where it's,
it is up,
violence is rampant on both sides.

817
00:51:42.710 --> 00:51:46.430
But if the,
the,
uh,
the argument would be that if the wall didn't exist,

818
00:51:46.670 --> 00:51:51.440
then it would be too easy to come back and forth.
Okay.
Um,
at all spots.

819
00:51:51.980 --> 00:51:56.660
Um,
yeah,
it could,
could,
you know,
but again,
drug [inaudible],
catapults,

820
00:51:57.110 --> 00:51:57.980
drones,
uh,

821
00:51:58.010 --> 00:52:02.720
drugs and in terms of what kidnapping people and a lot of other things that you

822
00:52:02.721 --> 00:52:07.250
cut off at least some of the vehicle.
Yeah,
I get it.
I get it.
I,
and I think,
again,

823
00:52:07.280 --> 00:52:12.140
I'm not against the wall,
build the wall.
Um,
uh,
that,
I interviewed a Guy,

824
00:52:12.250 --> 00:52:16.410
uh,
I do articles for a few magazines and I interviewed a guy who was a,
uh,

825
00:52:17.180 --> 00:52:20.480
it's a coyote kwiyate.
He moves people from the border.

826
00:52:21.230 --> 00:52:25.100
And he said this about the board was asking in the interview about the border

827
00:52:25.101 --> 00:52:28.550
wall and he said,
it's good for business,
you know,
uh,

828
00:52:28.580 --> 00:52:32.990
you make something seem like it's harder when it isn't and it's good for

829
00:52:32.991 --> 00:52:36.100
business on.
So you say,
listen,
I can't get children 3000,

830
00:52:36.101 --> 00:52:39.980
it's gotta be five and yeah,
it's tighter.
Yeah.
Or flying to Canada.

831
00:52:39.981 --> 00:52:42.860
And they walked down,
which is,
that was his,
one of his,

832
00:52:42.920 --> 00:52:45.180
one of his new favorite methods,
you know,

833
00:52:45.560 --> 00:52:48.530
so northern United States probably got a lot of Mexicans now.

834
00:52:50.930 --> 00:52:55.220
Yeah.
The candidate bulletin board is hilarious.
It's a path.
Yeah.

835
00:52:55.300 --> 00:53:00.200
It's a carved out hundred yard pat.
We put pictures of it up the other day.

836
00:53:00.201 --> 00:53:03.440
We're like,
look how hilarious it says the difference.
You,
Mexico and Canada,

837
00:53:03.740 --> 00:53:06.290
Canada,
they make it easy to know where the border is.

838
00:53:06.560 --> 00:53:10.960
Like just get across here a and it'd be fine.
Snow Mexicans,
you know?
Yeah.

839
00:53:11.570 --> 00:53:14.650
It's really strange.
Well,
I mean,
it's the,
the,
the,

840
00:53:14.660 --> 00:53:18.020
the amount of creativity and problem solving that goes on,
on the,

841
00:53:18.110 --> 00:53:22.610
on the criminal side,
you know,
um,
uh,
if,
if,

842
00:53:22.640 --> 00:53:26.220
if your best plan is,
is a wall of a secure wall.

843
00:53:26.250 --> 00:53:30.180
These guys have been working against that best plan for the past 20 years.

844
00:53:30.510 --> 00:53:34.590
So they are,
they're already way ahead of the curve in that regard.
You know,

845
00:53:35.520 --> 00:53:39.330
uh,
there was an interesting time in a drunk and people can look this up.

846
00:53:39.640 --> 00:53:41.520
A drone technology had a,

847
00:53:41.820 --> 00:53:46.140
had an upsurge in innovation in Tijuana out of all places in the world for a

848
00:53:46.141 --> 00:53:50.370
time.
You know,
like why that's funny,
you know,

849
00:53:50.440 --> 00:53:54.450
wonder hmm.
And what they were doing when those,

850
00:53:54.540 --> 00:53:58.890
what could be done to radically curb this,

851
00:53:59.880 --> 00:54:03.240
uh,
you know,
like if you were the king of the world said,
ed,

852
00:54:03.480 --> 00:54:06.060
what are we going to do?
Uh,
first off,

853
00:54:06.270 --> 00:54:10.750
legalizing sums up some of the substances would probably help.
Uh,

854
00:54:11.010 --> 00:54:13.290
that would help a lot.
Um,

855
00:54:15.720 --> 00:54:19.080
that's a pretty good question.
But even some substances that are illegal,

856
00:54:19.890 --> 00:54:24.360
like fentanyl's essentially legal because you can get a prescription for it,
but

857
00:54:25.860 --> 00:54:29.040
you're never going to have like fentanyl just over the counter.

858
00:54:29.070 --> 00:54:32.730
It's just too deadly.
Uh,
you know,
another thing that,
you know,
I think about,

859
00:54:32.731 --> 00:54:35.490
and that's a very good question.
I wish I could answer.
Uh,

860
00:54:35.640 --> 00:54:39.480
I think everybody wishes they can answer it and everyone just sorta like shrugs.

861
00:54:39.480 --> 00:54:44.130
And so the,
the,
the cartels aren't just a drug fueled business.

862
00:54:44.880 --> 00:54:49.880
They also have money that is in property and legitimize businesses.

863
00:54:50.790 --> 00:54:55.290
Uh,
they work in human trafficking.
Like they act you if you used to be,

864
00:54:55.291 --> 00:54:58.470
you can cross that border and go to the desert and cross it yourself.

865
00:54:58.471 --> 00:55:02.610
But now you have to be a toll,
uh,
protection rackets across the,

866
00:55:02.611 --> 00:55:07.110
on both sides of the border.
Um,
sex trafficking,

867
00:55:07.410 --> 00:55:12.240
um,
piracy like,
like you name it,
they have,
they have hands on it,

868
00:55:12.270 --> 00:55:13.103
right?
So,

869
00:55:13.470 --> 00:55:18.240
so they're just essentially took that drug money and just diversify a crime

870
00:55:18.241 --> 00:55:21.300
business,
diversified.
You know,
they've been diversified for a long time.

871
00:55:21.301 --> 00:55:25.230
Like there was a recent to lead to a three,

872
00:55:25.260 --> 00:55:27.720
three cartel members from Sina Loa,
uh,

873
00:55:27.870 --> 00:55:30.780
in Malaysia released out of all places.

874
00:55:30.781 --> 00:55:33.480
So you just think about that too.

875
00:55:33.481 --> 00:55:38.040
Seeing the law cartel guys somewhere in Malaysia got caught somewhere and now

876
00:55:38.041 --> 00:55:41.730
they've been released and they got it like a hero's welcome into Mexico to get a

877
00:55:41.731 --> 00:55:45.470
hero's welcome.
Oh yeah.
Really,
let's see in the law that you know that again,

878
00:55:45.480 --> 00:55:48.840
seeing the low as a pretty,
that's a,
I have this nickname for Mexico,

879
00:55:48.841 --> 00:55:51.210
I call it the upside down,
you know,
uh,

880
00:55:51.211 --> 00:55:54.450
because everything's basically upside down now.
And uh,
yeah,

881
00:55:54.451 --> 00:55:59.010
these guys got funny thing is that the Mexican government was involved in their

882
00:55:59.011 --> 00:56:02.760
release and then they send them back and hero's welcome.

883
00:56:02.790 --> 00:56:06.390
What were they doing all the way over there and that part of the world that I

884
00:56:06.391 --> 00:56:09.660
don't know,
you know,
diversifying,
diversifying.

885
00:56:11.040 --> 00:56:13.290
So no one has a real plan.
Here it goes,

886
00:56:13.291 --> 00:56:17.220
Malaysia pardons three Mexicans on death row.
Oh,
they were on death row,

887
00:56:17.730 --> 00:56:18.830
Dan.
Um,

888
00:56:19.020 --> 00:56:22.860
you want to talk about a kick ass Garrido like a folk song song about you.

889
00:56:22.861 --> 00:56:26.950
Those are probably going to get an amazing folks on,
you know?
Um,

890
00:56:27.640 --> 00:56:31.450
so there's a lot of romanticism.
Yeah.
I mean,
it's,
uh,

891
00:56:31.900 --> 00:56:36.320
it's romanticism,
it's religion.
There's definitely some,
some,
uh,
cultism uh,

892
00:56:36.321 --> 00:56:40.170
involved in a lot of the higher ups in these cartels.
Uh,

893
00:56:40.210 --> 00:56:43.540
I can remember when I found out about the narco music,
these,

894
00:56:43.570 --> 00:56:48.310
what are those songs called?
At CoreOS?
The folk songs.
Um,
there's a lot of them,

895
00:56:48.311 --> 00:56:50.370
you know,
there's a,
and they,

896
00:56:50.410 --> 00:56:53.700
all of them have a secret language in them sometimes or,

897
00:56:53.701 --> 00:56:58.600
or they're all a history of something that happened and you pay somebody to,

898
00:56:58.660 --> 00:57:03.490
to,
to,
to,
to,
to,
to make one for you or somebody makes it for you.

899
00:57:04.150 --> 00:57:09.150
And then if you do a good choreo song for somebody and the rivals,

900
00:57:09.431 --> 00:57:12.070
we'll send somebody to kill you.
You know,
so like,

901
00:57:12.100 --> 00:57:16.540
even even the musicians are on either side of the cartel kind of groupings as

902
00:57:16.541 --> 00:57:20.230
well,
which is pretty weird.
I know,
but it's,
wow.

903
00:57:20.440 --> 00:57:24.760
So if you're,
if you're for the wrong cartel,

904
00:57:24.790 --> 00:57:25.930
if you make a song,

905
00:57:26.140 --> 00:57:31.140
you kind of have to like go into hiding or not play any in any places where

906
00:57:31.520 --> 00:57:35.290
literally rival cartels territory.
These are,
AH,
Jesus Christ.

907
00:57:35.920 --> 00:57:39.100
Will they come to your territory to come get you?
If you have?
Yeah,

908
00:57:39.180 --> 00:57:42.640
there's Finna be,
have been a few high level,
uh,
singers,

909
00:57:42.670 --> 00:57:46.040
Mexican folk singers that got their,
you know,
killed,
uh,

910
00:57:46.450 --> 00:57:47.740
for messing with the girlfriends,

911
00:57:47.770 --> 00:57:51.870
with cartel members or first thing in the wrong song in the wrong place.
Uh,

912
00:57:52.390 --> 00:57:55.270
so that's in the culture and,
and the religious,
uh,
uh,

913
00:57:55.271 --> 00:57:59.350
cultism of the cartels have as well.
You know,
it's a pretty interesting thing.
Um,

914
00:57:59.860 --> 00:58:00.500
things like [inaudible],

915
00:58:00.500 --> 00:58:05.500
Martha [inaudible] death cult that is kind of in different parts of Mexico.

916
00:58:05.891 --> 00:58:10.030
It's like a,
think of a very dark,
uh,

917
00:58:10.060 --> 00:58:13.180
free masonry type thing,
right?
So certain levels,

918
00:58:13.181 --> 00:58:14.670
you have people that are part of the,

919
00:58:14.950 --> 00:58:19.540
part of that cult from the cops to the military,
to the cartels.
It's kind of,

920
00:58:19.840 --> 00:58:24.010
uh,
to,
uh,
prostitutes and drug dealers.
Uh,

921
00:58:24.070 --> 00:58:28.090
it's interesting how,
how that kind of also has an influence on,
on,

922
00:58:28.900 --> 00:58:33.100
on the way.
Some people go into very risky businesses like being cops or,

923
00:58:33.210 --> 00:58:37.420
or are cartel guys and how they were,
are they empower themselves by,

924
00:58:37.421 --> 00:58:42.040
some of these are called iconographies.
You know,
I'm like,
wow.
Or,

925
00:58:42.910 --> 00:58:44.290
or,
um,
there's,

926
00:58:44.340 --> 00:58:49.060
there's the trinity is the [inaudible],
which is a,

927
00:58:49.390 --> 00:58:54.310
it was a folk hero from turn of the century in the law,
basically abandoned that,

928
00:58:54.311 --> 00:58:56.490
got caught and killed and he turned into a Satan.

929
00:58:56.500 --> 00:59:01.500
Now there's a giant church to him and Tina low with a bunch of money stuck to

930
00:59:02.291 --> 00:59:03.590
the walls and um,

931
00:59:03.760 --> 00:59:08.760
pictures of guys in the US with like a F150 truck or a hummer.

932
00:59:08.820 --> 00:59:13.540
Like,
thank you.
[inaudible] I am living the dream now because of you.
Wow.

933
00:59:13.620 --> 00:59:17.840
Eh,
to roadside altars with,
uh,
with a,

934
00:59:17.850 --> 00:59:19.630
a statue of the Virgin Mary.

935
00:59:20.530 --> 00:59:25.280
And then you look her and there's a reaper behind it because it's a hidden Santa

936
00:59:25.280 --> 00:59:28.110
Marta,
a shrine.
And they do that too.
So the knowledge,

937
00:59:28.150 --> 00:59:31.220
he doesn't destroy them because they have standing orders to destroy these

938
00:59:31.221 --> 00:59:35.690
things,
which shouldn't be,
but you know,
kind of religious persecution.

939
00:59:35.691 --> 00:59:38.750
But they actually do that.
It's so,

940
00:59:39.500 --> 00:59:44.010
it's so different than the United States and a lot of ways it is.
I mean,

941
00:59:44.180 --> 00:59:47.090
I don't think we understand like all this stuff.

942
00:59:47.330 --> 00:59:50.960
I think the average person has no idea about the songs,

943
00:59:51.200 --> 00:59:53.300
no idea about the culture of it all.

944
00:59:53.510 --> 00:59:58.510
They have no idea the depth and how deeply it's connected to the society down

945
00:59:59.391 --> 01:00:02.630
there.
I mean the death,
the death cult worship is,

946
01:00:03.170 --> 01:00:06.530
I think you could probably trace it back to the Aztec days.
All right,

947
01:00:06.531 --> 01:00:10.520
so there's definitely,
when you see all these highly graph,

948
01:00:10.550 --> 01:00:14.860
highly violent bloody cartel executions and things like that.
I don't know.

949
01:00:14.900 --> 01:00:15.733
I mean,
yeah,

950
01:00:15.890 --> 01:00:18.800
I think there's some sort of genetic memory from that time of those times.

951
01:00:18.840 --> 01:00:23.330
It's not abnormal physically for some of these people that do that type of
thing.

952
01:00:23.360 --> 01:00:26.180
You know,
ripping somebody heart next to a tree is like,

953
01:00:26.210 --> 01:00:27.740
there's videos of that stuff out there.

954
01:00:27.830 --> 01:00:31.860
I remember getting contacted by people that I knew on this side of the,
uh,

955
01:00:31.861 --> 01:00:34.030
of the border in the u s uh,

956
01:00:34.100 --> 01:00:36.740
that were very curious of why all these people from the Middle East.

957
01:00:36.741 --> 01:00:39.020
We're looking at all these cartel execution videos.

958
01:00:39.050 --> 01:00:42.920
And then a few years later you had isis doing some high production execution

959
01:00:42.921 --> 01:00:46.130
videos that were inspired by the cartels,
you know?
Wow.

960
01:00:46.610 --> 01:00:50.240
So is that interesting that we don't think about that?
We think about,
oh my God,

961
01:00:50.241 --> 01:00:50.811
look at Isis.

962
01:00:50.811 --> 01:00:52.940
They're cutting people's heads off like they've learned from Mexico,

963
01:00:52.941 --> 01:00:56.780
which is connected to us by labs right down there.
Fucking walked there.
Like,

964
01:00:57.110 --> 01:01:00.440
you don't have to fly to Afghanistan.
You could walk there.
It's not in Libya.

965
01:01:00.800 --> 01:01:02.360
It's near La Jolla

966
01:01:03.900 --> 01:01:06.020
is you call it a little lawyer.

967
01:01:06.050 --> 01:01:11.050
You see these fucking multimillion dollar estates with this gorgeous view and

968
01:01:11.331 --> 01:01:15.650
everyone's driving Ferrari's and Porsche's 20 minutes drive.

969
01:01:15.920 --> 01:01:19.520
You're in Tiawana.
Yeah.
The most violent city on the planet right now.

970
01:01:19.630 --> 01:01:23.240
It's so crazy.
Yeah.
And when I go to San Diego,
that's the,

971
01:01:23.330 --> 01:01:26.390
one of the first things I think is how,
what a juxtaposition,

972
01:01:26.750 --> 01:01:30.950
how crazy it is that this is the border to Mexico and it's all military.

973
01:01:31.220 --> 01:01:36.220
San Diego is filled with fucking seals and rangers and Marines and bases and

974
01:01:36.891 --> 01:01:39.590
it's just all military down there sits.

975
01:01:39.591 --> 01:01:44.210
So military influence and it's right next to the most violent,

976
01:01:44.211 --> 01:01:47.630
dangerous city on planet earth.
More than Karachi,

977
01:01:47.930 --> 01:01:51.170
more than Pakistan.
Uh,
we were,
uh,

978
01:01:51.290 --> 01:01:54.800
we were insured by metlife and the metlife agent said,

979
01:01:54.920 --> 01:01:56.990
said something along those lines like,

980
01:01:57.260 --> 01:02:00.940
you're better off going to Afghanistan or Iraq then,
you know,

981
01:02:00.950 --> 01:02:05.020
working here basically numbers wise.
And I was like,
thank you for that.
You know,

982
01:02:06.180 --> 01:02:08.840
that felt that,
that felt like a good pat on the back.

983
01:02:08.900 --> 01:02:12.680
But it seems like they're getting cartel on cartel crime.
Yeah.

984
01:02:12.710 --> 01:02:16.070
Fused with regular person crimes.
So,

985
01:02:16.550 --> 01:02:20.580
but that's how it always starts.
You know,
it's usually starts off,
and again,

986
01:02:20.581 --> 01:02:24.870
this goes back to everything's cyclical down there that that snake eating its

987
01:02:24.871 --> 01:02:25.704
tail.

988
01:02:26.160 --> 01:02:29.250
So you would get cartel on cartel crime and then they finish each other off and

989
01:02:29.251 --> 01:02:31.680
then they realize,
well,
now,
now what do we do?

990
01:02:31.800 --> 01:02:35.130
So they started abducting people extortion just for money.

991
01:02:35.190 --> 01:02:38.850
Just extortion comes into play.
Uh,
you know,

992
01:02:39.460 --> 01:02:43.800
protection rackets
cross us a guy.

993
01:02:43.860 --> 01:02:47.400
Now they're very bold that now they're at a party somewhere and somebody looks

994
01:02:47.401 --> 01:02:50.870
at it and funny.
So they come back and they shoot up the whole Party.
Uh,

995
01:02:50.910 --> 01:02:53.310
I like your daughter.
She's pretty hot.
I'm going to steal her.

996
01:02:53.370 --> 01:02:54.950
And if you do something,
I'll kill you and you're,

997
01:02:54.951 --> 01:02:57.630
you're never going to see your daughter again.
That's how it starts.
You know?

998
01:02:57.660 --> 01:03:02.020
That's,
that's how it started.
Kind of growing.
Just bold.
Brazen that,

999
01:03:02.030 --> 01:03:05.900
that's cruel.
That's how you get it.
Sociopathic.
That's how you get,

1000
01:03:05.901 --> 01:03:07.860
say I get to that point.
And then again,

1001
01:03:07.920 --> 01:03:12.920
I experienced it back in 2006 era and I saw it get into all the way to win.

1002
01:03:15.001 --> 01:03:16.830
The whole of the municipal police were,

1003
01:03:16.831 --> 01:03:21.700
were they basically the army surrounded the municipal police office of,
of the,

1004
01:03:21.970 --> 01:03:26.850
the,
the beliefs at the Juana and they took all their guns and a few of them were

1005
01:03:26.851 --> 01:03:31.851
taking on a plane ride to Mexico City and there for a few weeks there was no

1006
01:03:32.761 --> 01:03:35.760
armed police in Tijuana and La municipal armed police.
Imagine somebody,

1007
01:03:36.420 --> 01:03:40.200
imagine somebody disarming the whole lop a all of the LAPD and just having the

1008
01:03:40.201 --> 01:03:44.790
army in there and said,
you know,
wow.
So you would see,

1009
01:03:44.791 --> 01:03:48.000
you would see these events and then things calming down.
You know,

1010
01:03:48.060 --> 01:03:52.500
the only success story as far as us as far as the city coming back from the

1011
01:03:52.501 --> 01:03:56.070
brink was the Juana for when all that,
uh,

1012
01:03:56.100 --> 01:03:58.740
like the raging drug war went down.
Uh,

1013
01:03:58.770 --> 01:04:01.890
lieutenant colonel is all of the guy that I used to work with.
Uh,

1014
01:04:01.891 --> 01:04:06.120
he took numbers down like everybody down in Mexico.

1015
01:04:06.121 --> 01:04:10.320
He had got hired then on to go to Juarez to try and replicate his success.

1016
01:04:11.690 --> 01:04:15.030
Uh,
the only successes were there because he basically treated the problem as a

1017
01:04:15.031 --> 01:04:19.020
counter insurgency problem,
not a policing problem.
And he had,

1018
01:04:19.050 --> 01:04:23.160
he got a nine attempts on his life.
The last one,
uh,
took the use of his legs.

1019
01:04:23.700 --> 01:04:26.220
And he's currently a current,

1020
01:04:26.520 --> 01:04:30.850
currently running for mayor of Dwana,
believe it or not.
And he's a,

1021
01:04:30.870 --> 01:04:32.410
he's in a wheelchair,
but he's still,

1022
01:04:32.880 --> 01:04:37.720
I wouldn't want not want to mess with that guy.
Wow.
Uh,
yeah,
we're a fat.

1023
01:04:37.730 --> 01:04:40.890
My myself and some numbers on my family are actually helping out with his

1024
01:04:40.891 --> 01:04:43.590
campaign that he's,
you know,
he's,
you,
he got the,

1025
01:04:43.591 --> 01:04:46.830
his one of his campaign office has got shut up,
shut up recently.

1026
01:04:48.360 --> 01:04:51.270
So is there any plans or the,

1027
01:04:51.271 --> 01:04:56.271
is there any push to try to treat the entire problem as a counter insurgency

1028
01:04:57.361 --> 01:05:02.190
problem to replicate the success that they hadn't Tiawana no,
it's uh,
it's,

1029
01:05:02.191 --> 01:05:02.880
uh,

1030
01:05:02.880 --> 01:05:07.880
that was a solution brought in by the right side of the political spectrum in

1031
01:05:08.341 --> 01:05:10.530
the,
in Mexico.
So it's,

1032
01:05:10.830 --> 01:05:14.550
it's a no go right now because everything's to the left.

1033
01:05:14.600 --> 01:05:19.270
And this guy just gotten office.
He's a,
he's,
he's has a few months in,
so yeah,

1034
01:05:19.271 --> 01:05:23.620
he just got into office.
So,
so you got five and a half more years of this dude.

1035
01:05:24.190 --> 01:05:27.790
We're in for a ride.
That's,
that's all I can say.
Yeah.

1036
01:05:27.820 --> 01:05:31.330
Kindness doesn't seem to work when you're dealing with cartels,

1037
01:05:31.390 --> 01:05:34.900
it seems like now you give him a hand,
a little take your feet.
That's,
that was,

1038
01:05:34.901 --> 01:05:39.750
that's a Mexican say
man.

1039
01:05:39.810 --> 01:05:44.770
It for you to have been in that business and to sort of be connected to it,

1040
01:05:44.771 --> 01:05:49.360
but outside of it now it did it seem like,
does it seem,

1041
01:05:50.050 --> 01:05:53.410
I mean it must be incredibly frustrating,
but it also must feel few tile,

1042
01:05:53.680 --> 01:05:56.710
like you've wasted time almost because it's not,
there's no,

1043
01:05:56.740 --> 01:06:00.580
no progress is ever going to be made.
Uh,
I have,
uh,
you know,

1044
01:06:00.581 --> 01:06:05.581
have a weird experience that I had a burned about two acres of pot somewhere in

1045
01:06:06.881 --> 01:06:10.540
Baja,
right.
Uh,
towards the end of my career.

1046
01:06:11.800 --> 01:06:14.410
And then things happen politically.

1047
01:06:14.411 --> 01:06:16.270
A bunch of Shakespeare Shakeups ever the office.

1048
01:06:16.271 --> 01:06:20.170
I got called in and the director at that of the institution that I was in at

1049
01:06:20.171 --> 01:06:22.900
that time was a shady character.

1050
01:06:23.860 --> 01:06:27.060
And I decided to sit,
you know what?
My,
my mom,

1051
01:06:27.120 --> 01:06:30.520
my mom had just passed away and that kind of affected me a little bit.

1052
01:06:31.120 --> 01:06:32.650
A lot of it,
a lot of bit,
you know,

1053
01:06:33.310 --> 01:06:36.040
and starting a family and stuff like that and you know,
had said,
you know what,

1054
01:06:36.041 --> 01:06:40.330
this is,
this is not worth it.
So I left,
quit my job,

1055
01:06:40.331 --> 01:06:45.310
handed everything in now,
um,
people were suspicious about why I did it,
you know,

1056
01:06:45.820 --> 01:06:49.570
probably found $1 million somewhere in your writing or shit like that.
Right.

1057
01:06:49.571 --> 01:06:53.710
So I had to leave in a hurry.
You know,
you got a few threats.
Wow.

1058
01:06:54.100 --> 01:06:57.030
Gladly.
I,
uh,
gladly I had,

1059
01:06:57.700 --> 01:07:00.880
luckily I had some great people on this side of the border,

1060
01:07:00.970 --> 01:07:05.770
the friendships that I developed for a long while.
Um,

1061
01:07:05.920 --> 01:07:07.090
and they helped me out.
You know,

1062
01:07:08.230 --> 01:07:13.230
I went to Denver about two weeks after I got done with the job and a old lady

1063
01:07:13.661 --> 01:07:14.980
handed me a special cookie.

1064
01:07:15.070 --> 01:07:18.790
At one of the dispensaries and I saw the people walking in,
you know,

1065
01:07:18.910 --> 01:07:22.550
and it's like,
this is,
this,
is this what I've been,
you know?
Right.

1066
01:07:23.110 --> 01:07:28.030
Burning and chasing people in the middle of the night and looking at drug planes

1067
01:07:28.031 --> 01:07:32.020
and violence and all this,
this lady with a cookie.

1068
01:07:32.410 --> 01:07:35.740
Now it's a store.
It's just,
it's a beautiful store in Denver.

1069
01:07:35.800 --> 01:07:40.690
There's a store in front of La,
uh,
in front of the Improv that I have to,

1070
01:07:40.750 --> 01:07:43.420
I have to put a video up because me and interest Santina were there last night

1071
01:07:43.421 --> 01:07:47.920
making fun of it.
I'll send it to you,
Jamie right now.
Cause it's so ridiculous.

1072
01:07:48.640 --> 01:07:53.590
They have shit under glass,
like a,
you look,
you're looking at art pieces.
I mean,

1073
01:07:53.620 --> 01:07:54.950
again,
um,

1074
01:07:56.340 --> 01:07:59.630
I don't know why they're still producing pot in Mexico when you guys have it

1075
01:08:00.430 --> 01:08:02.620
having in the stratosphere as far as an art form.

1076
01:08:02.860 --> 01:08:06.340
I'm gonna send you this right now,
Jamie.
Yeah,
well,

1077
01:08:06.341 --> 01:08:08.920
they definitely have it down now,
but it's just,

1078
01:08:08.921 --> 01:08:12.640
it shouldn't be illegal in the first place and that's not hurting anybody.

1079
01:08:12.700 --> 01:08:17.650
I just sent it to,
um,
there's a bunch of,
uh,
there's a large,
uh,

1080
01:08:17.990 --> 01:08:22.990
shamanism and a cultism all rural Mexico and mushrooms and use down there for

1081
01:08:24.020 --> 01:08:27.290
like forever and uh,
you know,
growing up and stuff like that,

1082
01:08:27.291 --> 01:08:29.030
you would see it and it was,
you know,

1083
01:08:29.600 --> 01:08:34.000
the demonization comes from the conflict around it.
Not that it's,

1084
01:08:34.460 --> 01:08:35.850
you know,
well there's should,

1085
01:08:35.851 --> 01:08:38.630
should be real demonization when it comes to things like fentanyl to just whack.

1086
01:08:38.700 --> 01:08:42.640
Ue lists the to turn the volume up so we can see here this understanding

1087
01:08:42.730 --> 01:08:47.200
<v 1>state of marijuana.
And so the California,
I'm inspecting the crystals,</v>

1088
01:08:47.201 --> 01:08:50.680
Jane Crystalline,
a magnifying glass,
there's no bullshit.

1089
01:08:50.890 --> 01:08:52.300
These are all in glass.

1090
01:08:52.301 --> 01:08:56.740
So you can look at the crystals because a lot of these marijuana dorks,

1091
01:08:56.950 --> 01:09:01.240
I like wine dorks or any other thing where people really get into it and you

1092
01:09:01.241 --> 01:09:05.650
take it too far when he's looking at weed under glass and Julie ideas and be

1093
01:09:05.651 --> 01:09:06.484
here right now,

1094
01:09:07.480 --> 01:09:11.500
fuck this shit right in the mouth and try to have lead underclass.

1095
01:09:11.530 --> 01:09:13.370
Like it's a fine sharp names.

1096
01:09:15.590 --> 01:09:20.560
It's just weed man
speaks the truth.
It's just weed,

1097
01:09:20.561 --> 01:09:21.280
man.

1098
01:09:21.280 --> 01:09:23.580
<v 0>That's an antique roadshow type level stuff.</v>

1099
01:09:24.280 --> 01:09:28.710
They give you a magnifying glass and they had all these displays with the,

1100
01:09:28.711 --> 01:09:32.440
this is a hybrid.
This is a,
an indycar strong hybrid.

1101
01:09:32.441 --> 01:09:36.040
This is a sativa Straw to Tiva dominant or you're supposed to smell it.

1102
01:09:36.390 --> 01:09:39.100
That glass.
Good questions.
Yeah,
that's the right stores.

1103
01:09:39.101 --> 01:09:41.830
Have a little jar that you can smell through to.
Very good question.

1104
01:09:42.040 --> 01:09:46.000
We would just grab all of it machetes and just put it in a big pile and just

1105
01:09:46.001 --> 01:09:49.560
chop it up and load it up.
Part of the wind coming from over there.
Well,

1106
01:09:49.561 --> 01:09:53.710
I'm going to sit over here.
Wow.
Yeah.
He would get it pass after that.

1107
01:09:53.711 --> 01:09:56.140
So it was fine.
You gotta get a little fucked up.
Oh,

1108
01:09:56.141 --> 01:09:59.170
burning all that stuff for us.
The second hand smoking the butter m and.
M's.

1109
01:09:59.171 --> 01:10:00.004
That was my,
that

1110
01:10:03.040 --> 01:10:07.330
was there a sense of frustration when it was legalized in so many states in the

1111
01:10:07.331 --> 01:10:11.860
United States
in some regard.
Yes.
What are we dying for?

1112
01:10:11.861 --> 01:10:15.730
What are we fighting for?
Why have I lost brothers?
Uh,
you know,
uh,
you know,

1113
01:10:15.790 --> 01:10:20.790
a lot of people were killed over finding tons of pot somewhere and now it's

1114
01:10:21.431 --> 01:10:26.200
fine.
Yeah,
no,
you can just buy it.
And it's,
I mean,
you know,
the frustration isn't,

1115
01:10:26.230 --> 01:10:29.000
isn't with the pot itself,
again,
it's,
it's,

1116
01:10:29.060 --> 01:10:31.270
it's what happens around the politics around it.

1117
01:10:31.780 --> 01:10:35.130
The amount of money invested into fighting it and,
and,

1118
01:10:35.280 --> 01:10:39.310
and violence and interest around it.
But the plan itself up again,
my,

1119
01:10:39.620 --> 01:10:44.020
my mom used to grow it and put it in a jar with alcohol and rub it on her

1120
01:10:44.021 --> 01:10:49.000
muscles,
you know,
and now it's a thing,
you know,
it's always,

1121
01:10:49.150 --> 01:10:52.640
it's always been there.
They all of a sudden,
uh,

1122
01:10:53.340 --> 01:10:54.840
you have full,
uh,

1123
01:10:54.890 --> 01:10:58.930
full on machine guns protecting it and the grow somewhere and filotto machine

1124
01:10:58.931 --> 01:10:59.430
guns,

1125
01:10:59.430 --> 01:11:02.500
another place where people coming in there to burn it because you shouldn't be

1126
01:11:02.501 --> 01:11:07.430
selling it.
It's just while,
while I was doing it,
uh,

1127
01:11:07.560 --> 01:11:11.290
you know,
my mindset was these are bad people.
When I,
when I started,
you know,

1128
01:11:11.291 --> 01:11:16.290
these are bad people that are doing drugs.
And later on I was like,
just a,

1129
01:11:16.640 --> 01:11:19.590
just a,
just a plant stinky plant.

1130
01:11:20.340 --> 01:11:21.750
So people are smoking it and never,

1131
01:11:21.780 --> 01:11:24.900
never in my life did I encountered a hyped up,
you know,

1132
01:11:24.901 --> 01:11:27.760
pod had they wanted a fight,
you know,
so I was like,
they should,

1133
01:11:27.960 --> 01:11:30.390
they should make this as cause loose.
Everybody would calm down.

1134
01:11:30.540 --> 01:11:33.270
It didn't make a difference.
Coke is different methods,
different of course.

1135
01:11:33.660 --> 01:11:34.210
But you know,

1136
01:11:34.210 --> 01:11:38.880
pot when you were talking about how everyone with a six year plan,

1137
01:11:38.910 --> 01:11:40.650
it's not going to work.
It's never going to work.

1138
01:11:40.680 --> 01:11:45.680
It seems to me that with the Romanticism of the cults and the way that it's

1139
01:11:46.261 --> 01:11:50.850
ingrained in the culture and that they look at these people like folk heroes,

1140
01:11:51.210 --> 01:11:54.250
that this is a generational problem.
It seems like,
um,

1141
01:11:54.480 --> 01:11:57.510
many generations before it changes and calms down.

1142
01:11:57.511 --> 01:12:02.250
And I would struggle to think of what would be the thing that could cause it to

1143
01:12:02.251 --> 01:12:06.210
calm down.
Like what,
what could be the catalyst for change?
Yeah.

1144
01:12:06.300 --> 01:12:08.610
And more so than things kind of,
uh,

1145
01:12:10.060 --> 01:12:12.880
that things are getting even more complicated now with,
uh,

1146
01:12:13.350 --> 01:12:15.060
Mike migrant caravans going through,

1147
01:12:15.120 --> 01:12:18.510
through Mexico now and now you have all these,
these,
this place,

1148
01:12:18.511 --> 01:12:23.511
the people from South America now adding onto the problem of an already existing

1149
01:12:23.971 --> 01:12:26.430
as the caravan.
We hear about it on the news,

1150
01:12:26.431 --> 01:12:31.380
like from Fox News talks about it like scare tactics.
So,
um,
I was,

1151
01:12:31.590 --> 01:12:33.660
I don't know,
and people can fact check me on this,

1152
01:12:33.661 --> 01:12:37.380
but I was probably one of the first ones to publicly say that they were going to

1153
01:12:37.381 --> 01:12:41.280
go the first cabin.
It's going to go straight to Tijuana.
Everybody was,

1154
01:12:41.281 --> 01:12:44.790
now they're not going to go straight to Tijuana.
There the Acessa too far off.

1155
01:12:44.791 --> 01:12:49.700
They should just go to Texas.
And they went straight to Tijuana and you know,

1156
01:12:49.800 --> 01:12:54.420
there,
there were about 3000 strong when they got there and maybe a bit more.

1157
01:12:55.260 --> 01:13:00.210
And you know,
a bunch of memes came up because of it.
Uh,
uh,

1158
01:13:00.330 --> 01:13:02.130
as they were going through all the Mexico,

1159
01:13:02.160 --> 01:13:06.150
most of the people were pretty welcoming because they weren't going to stay.

1160
01:13:06.390 --> 01:13:08.090
And now they were like,
here's a water.

1161
01:13:08.120 --> 01:13:10.650
Like when somebody is doing a jog or run marathon,

1162
01:13:10.651 --> 01:13:13.260
they would hand a puddle of water bottle and you good returns.

1163
01:13:13.950 --> 01:13:16.440
They finally got to Tj and Tj is very conservative,

1164
01:13:17.250 --> 01:13:21.930
like politically is very conservative place and they met with a wall of

1165
01:13:21.931 --> 01:13:26.200
protestors wearing make tea kwon at great again hats.
No,

1166
01:13:26.250 --> 01:13:29.790
yes,
yes,
no,
yes,
yes.

1167
01:13:29.820 --> 01:13:32.870
And I may or may not have produced a few of those myself.
And

1168
01:13:34.800 --> 01:13:35.633
uh,

1169
01:13:35.640 --> 01:13:39.030
and all of a sudden you see the marathon Juana without make them make the wine a

1170
01:13:39.031 --> 01:13:40.710
great again hat on his head.
Wow.

1171
01:13:40.950 --> 01:13:45.180
And the reason why they were so adverse to these guys coming in is that uh,

1172
01:13:45.300 --> 01:13:49.320
they were a lot of them gang members,
you know,
14th street gang members.

1173
01:13:49.620 --> 01:13:53.220
The reason why they didn't go the other route is because they would have to have

1174
01:13:53.221 --> 01:13:57.540
crossed little set does territory was a cartel that has problems with the 14

1175
01:13:57.541 --> 01:14:00.060
gang.
So they were curtailing that.

1176
01:14:01.110 --> 01:14:03.720
They were complaining about the food they were getting at the shelters.

1177
01:14:04.070 --> 01:14:07.340
You sit there and thermal country feeding third world migrants and we would

1178
01:14:07.341 --> 01:14:11.920
feeding them tortillas and beans and there's a famous lady,
it was like,

1179
01:14:11.950 --> 01:14:14.400
I'm not gonna eat this as pig.
And I was pygmy,

1180
01:14:15.450 --> 01:14:20.200
you want a great again.
So it's trolling on a another level.

1181
01:14:20.220 --> 01:14:22.840
Wow.
So,
um,
these guys came in,

1182
01:14:22.841 --> 01:14:27.190
but people started calling me the people from Tijuana Racist,
the Brown people.

1183
01:14:27.260 --> 01:14:29.590
Do you want to erase it against other Brown people?
Wow.

1184
01:14:29.740 --> 01:14:33.100
And you would see some of the,
the uh,
you know,

1185
01:14:34.000 --> 01:14:38.000
some of the news agencies from the US come down and volunteer groups who were

1186
01:14:38.001 --> 01:14:40.240
hippies,
you know,
with uh,

1187
01:14:40.270 --> 01:14:44.110
sending all their donations to these people in some of these minor caravan
camps,

1188
01:14:44.440 --> 01:14:48.460
they would grab the donations,
turn around and sell it on the backside.
You know,

1189
01:14:48.461 --> 01:14:51.520
all of these things they would sell in the backside.
So we would,
they were,

1190
01:14:52.900 --> 01:14:55.120
we had just absorbed about,
uh,

1191
01:14:55.330 --> 01:14:59.500
2000 or 3000 Haitian immigrants after the earthquake and [inaudible] no problems

1192
01:14:59.501 --> 01:15:01.870
at all.
They're integrated into the culture.

1193
01:15:02.440 --> 01:15:05.920
All of a sudden now we have Haitians in the culture,
you know,
no problem at all.

1194
01:15:06.130 --> 01:15:09.040
But these guys came in and they were really kind of disruptive in that way.

1195
01:15:09.110 --> 01:15:09.311
Right.

1196
01:15:09.311 --> 01:15:13.150
So now do you think that it was because all the attention they were getting?

1197
01:15:13.300 --> 01:15:15.170
Yeah.
Uh,
that's what they wanted.
You know,

1198
01:15:15.280 --> 01:15:17.860
they wanted to create some sort of situation on the border,

1199
01:15:17.861 --> 01:15:22.840
so they rushed the border a few times.
Uh,
I was,
I was,
uh,
around there when they,

1200
01:15:22.900 --> 01:15:26.490
the famous picture of the lady with the kids running towards the border
happened.

1201
01:15:28.570 --> 01:15:32.530
They were throwing rocks at the border patrols their border patrol guys.

1202
01:15:32.531 --> 01:15:34.820
And that's,
you know,
they got the gas and you know,

1203
01:15:34.821 --> 01:15:37.540
the response and that's when she was running away.
Yeah.

1204
01:15:37.600 --> 01:15:40.540
And they had a lot of people,
they're throwing rocks.
Yeah.

1205
01:15:40.570 --> 01:15:42.700
That they threw rocks constantly.
That was her thing.

1206
01:15:42.760 --> 01:15:46.300
And it's funny how photo can give you a totally different perspective.
Again,

1207
01:15:46.330 --> 01:15:48.040
anybody that's doubting any of this,

1208
01:15:48.070 --> 01:15:50.910
go down with the Quanta and asked the people from Tijuana to want the people did

1209
01:15:50.911 --> 01:15:55.060
not want those people there.
They saw them as disruptive crime went up.

1210
01:15:55.160 --> 01:15:57.940
One of the encampments that they have was next to a school.

1211
01:15:57.941 --> 01:16:00.790
The school had to be shut down because of the needles and stuff that was

1212
01:16:00.791 --> 01:16:03.340
competing,
getting found outside of the playground at school.

1213
01:16:03.730 --> 01:16:05.080
It was a massive nightmare.

1214
01:16:05.380 --> 01:16:10.270
And then we would see it on the news and it was like flowers and um,
you know,

1215
01:16:10.330 --> 01:16:12.460
on the narrow you have the narrative was like,

1216
01:16:12.750 --> 01:16:14.560
I don't know what these guys are talking about.

1217
01:16:14.980 --> 01:16:19.980
Well Trump is such a polarizing figure than anything that would be anti

1218
01:16:21.461 --> 01:16:25.210
immigration like that.
Like an anti ma,
they just don't want to hear it.

1219
01:16:25.240 --> 01:16:29.740
But they'd be out of the,
the the weird thing is how a lot of people,
uh,

1220
01:16:29.890 --> 01:16:34.390
Mexicans like Trump,
you know,
which is really well,
yeah.
Why is that?

1221
01:16:34.810 --> 01:16:36.880
I think a,
the whole art,

1222
01:16:37.210 --> 01:16:40.450
I'm going to defend our people with type thing that's there like that.
Yeah.

1223
01:16:40.451 --> 01:16:43.360
And a lot,
and people have to remember the most Mexicans are very conservative,

1224
01:16:43.380 --> 01:16:46.600
you know,
Catholic concern guy.
So it kind of resonates with them in a little,

1225
01:16:47.650 --> 01:16:51.610
but you know,
again,
we're divided as well as you guys are politically.

1226
01:16:51.670 --> 01:16:54.670
So there's a lot of,
a lot of to the left type of leading people down there.

1227
01:16:54.671 --> 01:16:57.940
So they,
you know,
again,
narrative,
you know,
divide and conquer.

1228
01:16:58.210 --> 01:17:02.020
But the people on the left,
what is their perspective on the Migraine Caravan?
Oh,

1229
01:17:02.021 --> 01:17:06.080
support it,
you know,
opened the borders,
you know,
let him throw,

1230
01:17:06.100 --> 01:17:10.820
not boots on the ground.
No,
well not,

1231
01:17:10.821 --> 01:17:12.710
not that you have boots on the ground there.

1232
01:17:12.711 --> 01:17:15.790
Their cities are not the ones that are hosting all of these people.
Right,
right,

1233
01:17:15.791 --> 01:17:17.800
right.
They're not right.
They're going down.

1234
01:17:17.840 --> 01:17:21.170
They don't have a realistic perspective on that.
So it's a narrative.

1235
01:17:21.171 --> 01:17:25.070
So imagine these are the,
this caravan came into Tj and affected the businesses,

1236
01:17:25.100 --> 01:17:28.400
the cross border and tourism business.
I,
all the people that live there.

1237
01:17:29.210 --> 01:17:32.150
So a lot of businesses actually closed down because of these people coming in.

1238
01:17:32.290 --> 01:17:35.750
Really?
And Yeah.
And the only reason they came in,
you know,

1239
01:17:35.780 --> 01:17:38.960
was to disrupt and created an international scene,

1240
01:17:38.961 --> 01:17:40.430
which is what exactly what they did.

1241
01:17:40.460 --> 01:17:44.200
So did they plan on actually trying to get across or they,
they,
they,

1242
01:17:44.201 --> 01:17:47.150
they were planning on jumping the fence and claiming asylum,

1243
01:17:47.410 --> 01:17:48.650
asylum on the other side.

1244
01:17:48.860 --> 01:17:53.390
And the famous lady freehold is that I kind of made famous on my Instagram

1245
01:17:53.391 --> 01:17:57.170
account.
She jumped a fence,
claimed asylum,
went to Texas,

1246
01:17:57.171 --> 01:18:00.890
and then her and her sister assaulted somebody somewhere and then she got

1247
01:18:00.891 --> 01:18:03.980
arrested,
got deported.
Probably.
So,
you know,

1248
01:18:04.700 --> 01:18:06.560
that's kind of the story of these people.

1249
01:18:06.620 --> 01:18:09.230
And then you would attract some of these people on social media.

1250
01:18:09.680 --> 01:18:12.560
So they would be all poor in the Maverick Caravan,
uh,

1251
01:18:12.640 --> 01:18:15.230
videos they would have on the news and then you would see them on their social

1252
01:18:15.231 --> 01:18:18.230
media accounts from back home that really be Tom bags and stuff like that,

1253
01:18:18.231 --> 01:18:21.760
you know,
maybe a fake one,
but still,
you know,
they were,
they were fun thing.

1254
01:18:21.800 --> 01:18:24.900
They're flossing,
you know,
it's,
it's a,

1255
01:18:24.901 --> 01:18:28.580
it's a weird dynamic on the border.
And as far as,
uh,

1256
01:18:28.940 --> 01:18:33.770
I think it's being utilized in a lot of ways as a political type thing is

1257
01:18:33.771 --> 01:18:37.530
currently because of the president you guys have up here.
And it,

1258
01:18:37.550 --> 01:18:38.480
correct me if I'm wrong,

1259
01:18:38.481 --> 01:18:43.481
but they do make an effort to not go into tourist areas to resort areas.

1260
01:18:45.790 --> 01:18:47.320
Then the cartel,

1261
01:18:47.480 --> 01:18:51.230
well this is the thing because they own it or they have investments in it.

1262
01:18:51.260 --> 01:18:55.010
That's wow.
So like if you go to [inaudible] or something like that,

1263
01:18:55.011 --> 01:18:59.030
you think they have investments,
they,
it's in their best interest of have things,

1264
01:18:59.031 --> 01:19:02.590
you know,
quiet.
Yeah.
A lot of people.
So I do a lot of training as far,
uh,

1265
01:19:02.630 --> 01:19:05.150
do a lot of classes,
stuff like that,
traveler safety things.

1266
01:19:05.660 --> 01:19:08.690
And people are amazed with some of the cases that I bring out the fourth that

1267
01:19:09.650 --> 01:19:12.710
they think they're going to get abducted or drug by the cartels and some

1268
01:19:12.770 --> 01:19:14.990
discotheques somewhere down there.
Yeah.

1269
01:19:15.050 --> 01:19:19.670
And it's usually American Americans traveling down there doing their thing now

1270
01:19:19.671 --> 01:19:22.340
and they're against other Americans and then coming back up,
it's perfect.

1271
01:19:22.430 --> 01:19:24.620
You know,
crime.
Oh really?
Yeah.

1272
01:19:24.650 --> 01:19:28.280
There's a lot of that not happened with a guy who killed his girlfriend down

1273
01:19:28.281 --> 01:19:30.680
there.
Yeah.
This is a case of something like that,

1274
01:19:30.681 --> 01:19:32.810
I think somewhere in the Caribbean.
Maybe that makes sense.

1275
01:19:32.811 --> 01:19:34.570
Like that'd be a good way to get rid of somebody who,

1276
01:19:34.610 --> 01:19:39.560
a lot of those cases that a mistake the cartel got her.
I miss her so much,
man.

1277
01:19:39.680 --> 01:19:41.300
A lot of that,
a lot of the,
a lot of the,
uh,

1278
01:19:41.301 --> 01:19:44.630
the drug things that happened down there during that spring break type era,

1279
01:19:44.780 --> 01:19:46.310
that type of timeframe.

1280
01:19:46.790 --> 01:19:50.100
It's always Americans against Americans kind of doing that and people think it's

1281
01:19:50.180 --> 01:19:55.180
the cartels are drug and people know it's sometimes it's Americans just taking

1282
01:19:55.401 --> 01:19:59.240
advantage of the whole,
uh,
being in the foreign land type thing.

1283
01:19:59.300 --> 01:20:03.680
I was staying with my family in Punta Mita at the four seasons and we,
uh,

1284
01:20:04.070 --> 01:20:04.903
we,
they,

1285
01:20:05.090 --> 01:20:09.060
we have these golf carts and you could take golf carts out of the resort and

1286
01:20:09.061 --> 01:20:11.930
they don't like we can we take the golf carts to the town and the lake shore.

1287
01:20:11.940 --> 01:20:13.860
Go ahead.
We leave the resort.

1288
01:20:14.760 --> 01:20:19.760
The first thing you see is a military vehicle armored with soldiers standing at

1289
01:20:21.061 --> 01:20:26.061
the border of the fucking four seasons with machine guns on the roof of this

1290
01:20:26.551 --> 01:20:30.310
thing,
standing there ready to rock in case anything goes down.
Yeah.
Uh,

1291
01:20:30.990 --> 01:20:35.910
probably waiting for the rival cartel guys to come through.
Yeah.
So again,

1292
01:20:35.940 --> 01:20:38.940
a lot of these people live yet at miser businesses a year,
years back.

1293
01:20:38.941 --> 01:20:40.290
So a lot of the money in those,

1294
01:20:40.320 --> 01:20:45.090
in those resorts probably probably trace it back to cartel interest.
Wow.

1295
01:20:45.120 --> 01:20:48.900
So it's just deep.
It goes,
it permeates the entire culture.

1296
01:20:50.460 --> 01:20:53.610
Yes.
It's um,
it's,
it's,
it's part of the business,

1297
01:20:53.690 --> 01:20:57.270
that model and a lot of the money that moves around down there,

1298
01:20:57.690 --> 01:21:00.660
there's some sort of relationship with it.
Jesus Christ,
man.

1299
01:21:00.661 --> 01:21:04.770
It's Kinda feel free for a guy like you who gave your blood,

1300
01:21:04.771 --> 01:21:08.220
sweat and tears and was a part of trying to stop this.

1301
01:21:09.090 --> 01:21:14.090
It must feel so strange to watch this night mayor sort of play out.

1302
01:21:14.450 --> 01:21:19.290
Um,
you know,
so being up here and most of my friends,
for some reason,

1303
01:21:19.291 --> 01:21:23.310
I have attracted so many like marines to my life.
I don't know why.
You know,

1304
01:21:24.070 --> 01:21:24.390
a lot.

1305
01:21:24.390 --> 01:21:29.390
I have a few see old friends and most mostly just crazy marine guys and I've

1306
01:21:29.551 --> 01:21:34.551
been learning about what postconflict is post a conflict or being a veteran.

1307
01:21:34.680 --> 01:21:39.120
A combat marinates is through them,
through their eyes.
Um,
you know,

1308
01:21:39.121 --> 01:21:42.360
things like posttraumatic stress disorder and stuff like that.

1309
01:21:42.361 --> 01:21:47.361
It's to Tbi are things that I didn't even know where thing tell that came up

1310
01:21:48.241 --> 01:21:52.920
here.
No one talks about it in Mexico,
that doesn't exist.
It's not,
you know,

1311
01:21:53.090 --> 01:21:57.620
it's not discussed now you,
if you go into a situation and you,
you know,

1312
01:21:57.750 --> 01:22:00.480
do something somewhere,
you get a few days off,
you know,

1313
01:22:01.070 --> 01:22:04.740
and that's about it and come back to work.
Wow.
And uh,

1314
01:22:05.280 --> 01:22:07.110
medical wise,
you know,
like I,

1315
01:22:07.111 --> 01:22:11.940
I've been discovering all these issues I have from that experience down there

1316
01:22:11.941 --> 01:22:16.860
and it's like what kind of issues?
Uh,
yeah,
my nose is pretty,
as pretty,

1317
01:22:16.861 --> 01:22:20.150
has been pretty substantially destroyed.
And like my,
I have a few,
you know,

1318
01:22:20.190 --> 01:22:24.780
head injuries and no,
I didn't know what they were,
you know,
I just,
it stress,

1319
01:22:24.781 --> 01:22:28.710
you know,
where on the body,
it's my age.
I'm 36 I shouldn't be feeling like this,

1320
01:22:28.740 --> 01:22:32.670
you know?
And through them they kind of pointed me into like,

1321
01:22:32.710 --> 01:22:36.270
you probably have this because this is what I had because I was in Iraq.

1322
01:22:36.510 --> 01:22:41.040
It's like I wasn't in Iraq,
might as well been in Iraq.
Well that's,

1323
01:22:41.041 --> 01:22:46.020
that's the thing that the,
the,
the,
and,
and also you guys recognize your veterans.

1324
01:22:46.980 --> 01:22:51.790
Um,
you know,
not,
you know,
not enough.
Not Enough.
Uh,
uh,

1325
01:22:51.840 --> 01:22:56.810
there's no such thing as a veteran down there.
You know,
that somebody,

1326
01:22:56.840 --> 01:23:00.570
uh,
somebody,
one of my asshole friends,
um,

1327
01:23:00.990 --> 01:23:05.990
a marine friends gave me a Mexican drug war veteran hat because all they,

1328
01:23:07.240 --> 01:23:09.100
all those guys had their own hats,
you know,

1329
01:23:09.101 --> 01:23:12.700
so I think he gave me his Mexican drug war veteran hat and had an eagle,

1330
01:23:13.130 --> 01:23:16.060
you know,
being strangled by a snake.
And it was pretty funny,
you know,

1331
01:23:16.070 --> 01:23:20.560
but then made me realize how there's a bunch of guys down in Mexico then amazing

1332
01:23:20.561 --> 01:23:24.280
things and they're getting the recognition because it's a war that they deny.

1333
01:23:25.480 --> 01:23:27.750
There's nothing happened.
There's no war happening.
This is like a,

1334
01:23:27.810 --> 01:23:31.690
the cartels and,
but there's no war.
You know,
even the current president said,

1335
01:23:31.691 --> 01:23:35.920
you know,
this is the end of the drug war,
because I said so kind of thing.
Oh,

1336
01:23:35.921 --> 01:23:39.370
so there's no war anymore.
Okay.
Because why the war is over.

1337
01:23:40.990 --> 01:23:44.350
Did you have any involvement is barely related,

1338
01:23:44.740 --> 01:23:47.980
but did you have any involvement or know anybody that had any involvement with,

1339
01:23:47.981 --> 01:23:52.210
um,
those Mormon cults that are down there?
Yes,

1340
01:23:52.270 --> 01:23:56.650
I do know people that,
uh,
and the Horez region,

1341
01:23:57.070 --> 01:24:01.690
uh,
that some of the Mitt Romney's family members in that region area.

1342
01:24:01.720 --> 01:24:04.060
Yeah,
I knew some federal,

1343
01:24:04.120 --> 01:24:07.870
I know some federal police guys and military guys that,
uh,

1344
01:24:09.790 --> 01:24:13.060
were curious about the amount of firearms that these guys had because they had

1345
01:24:13.061 --> 01:24:17.980
some,
uh,
they,
they basically fought the cartels off.
How crazy is that?
Well,
it's,

1346
01:24:18.100 --> 01:24:19.090
you know,
it's pretty,

1347
01:24:19.180 --> 01:24:24.180
it's pretty interesting being there and finding a white guy that speaks amazing

1348
01:24:24.311 --> 01:24:27.340
English and it was porn in Mexico and he can there a Mormons,

1349
01:24:27.341 --> 01:24:31.300
they're Mormons and they have to get like a visa to trial dos Brittany.

1350
01:24:31.310 --> 01:24:33.700
And people don't know that,
like Mitt Romney's dad.

1351
01:24:33.970 --> 01:24:37.000
The reason why Mitt Romney's dad never ran for president because he was born in

1352
01:24:37.001 --> 01:24:41.290
Mexico.
Yeah.
Ah,
yeah.
I mean,
there's a lot,
there's a lot of white Mexicans,

1353
01:24:41.320 --> 01:24:44.980
which is another weird thing that people don't know about.
Can I?
Hello?
Louis C K?

1354
01:24:45.190 --> 01:24:48.960
Yeah,
Louis C,
k,
Mexico,
that Canelo.
Yeah.
Um,
uh,

1355
01:24:48.970 --> 01:24:53.470
anybody that's have Irish ancestry,
if you go into a bar in Mexico,

1356
01:24:53.471 --> 01:24:54.640
some bars in Mexico,

1357
01:24:54.760 --> 01:24:57.670
you can probably get some free drinks if you tell me your Irish because the

1358
01:24:57.671 --> 01:25:02.671
Irish betrayed the Americans in the last Mexico American war and a lot of them

1359
01:25:03.251 --> 01:25:07.300
stayed down there and married some of the locals.
That's how Irish last name.

1360
01:25:07.450 --> 01:25:12.370
I'm one quarter.
That's how you got to come con Ella probably.
Right.
Um,
yeah,

1361
01:25:12.400 --> 01:25:15.970
the uh,
the,
the,
the,
the,
the,
the Mormon community in that area.

1362
01:25:15.971 --> 01:25:20.971
Basically a few of their members got abducted and the cartels were,

1363
01:25:21.820 --> 01:25:22.170
you know,

1364
01:25:22.170 --> 01:25:27.060
wanted to do more against them in these guys apparently got some high power to

1365
01:25:27.580 --> 01:25:32.500
long range rifles and they were shooting at these people from afar and they set

1366
01:25:32.501 --> 01:25:36.580
up this whole security apparatus around there at a town and,
uh,

1367
01:25:36.610 --> 01:25:41.420
the Mexican government,
um,
basically look the other way and kind of said,

1368
01:25:41.430 --> 01:25:45.060
vol.
It's fine.
Just don't,
you know,
don't get too crazy with it.
I mean,

1369
01:25:45.700 --> 01:25:47.890
there was some sort of interaction as far as,
uh,

1370
01:25:48.580 --> 01:25:52.490
them trying to appease things with them,
you know,
because realistically the,
the,

1371
01:25:52.491 --> 01:25:56.110
the town that they're,
that they made out there as a paradise,
I mean,

1372
01:25:56.111 --> 01:26:00.070
amongst other towns in that area.
It's a beautiful place,

1373
01:26:00.250 --> 01:26:04.070
really to beautiful plates.
Very organized,
very,
what is it called?
Is this it?

1374
01:26:04.071 --> 01:26:06.790
Jamie?
This is their Mormon little town.

1375
01:26:06.980 --> 01:26:11.660
So what kind of military did they have?
Their protects this town,
like if they've,

1376
01:26:11.690 --> 01:26:13.220
they've made their own military.

1377
01:26:13.400 --> 01:26:18.400
So I actually got to do a few reconnaissance things.

1378
01:26:18.531 --> 01:26:19.310
They're just,
there's,

1379
01:26:19.310 --> 01:26:24.110
this is passing by and what I saw that they had were a bunch of,
uh,

1380
01:26:24.140 --> 01:26:28.850
basically machine gun nest and some of the hilltops and they lit it.

1381
01:26:29.040 --> 01:26:33.230
They,
uh,
they limited the amount of access points to that little town.

1382
01:26:33.620 --> 01:26:37.010
So they had the bear basically there.
What happened when the people got abducted?

1383
01:26:38.060 --> 01:26:40.520
I think one of them got killed and then,
you know,

1384
01:26:40.550 --> 01:26:44.720
they wanted to kill other people and that there was this whole thing,

1385
01:26:44.750 --> 01:26:46.790
they went to the government for help and they didn't say anything.

1386
01:26:46.791 --> 01:26:50.960
So somehow they know procured firearms down there.

1387
01:26:50.990 --> 01:26:53.960
So they started defending their own.
What a strange story that is.

1388
01:26:54.200 --> 01:26:58.820
Because they left the United States when polygamy was illegal.
Yes.

1389
01:26:58.850 --> 01:27:01.640
When they started making polygamy illegal in Utah,
they went,
well,

1390
01:27:01.641 --> 01:27:04.640
we'll just go to Mexico because back when they did it,
there wasn't even cars.

1391
01:27:05.620 --> 01:27:07.430
So it was like no big deal to live in Mexico.

1392
01:27:07.431 --> 01:27:10.430
Like you're riding a fucking horse no matter where you are.
Yeah.
No,
didn't,

1393
01:27:10.431 --> 01:27:14.720
no difference.
No.
And they said,
we'll go over here.
But it is a nice,
I mean,
again,

1394
01:27:14.750 --> 01:27:19.310
it's a weird American like town in the middle of Juarez.
I mean,

1395
01:27:19.311 --> 01:27:23.960
how many people go Wheela?
Uh,
it's probably in the thousands.

1396
01:27:24.020 --> 01:27:27.980
Tens of thousands maybe.
Wow.
Yeah.
All Mormons,

1397
01:27:28.700 --> 01:27:32.900
all Mormons.
And a lot of Mexicans converts now.
So really?
Yeah.

1398
01:27:33.170 --> 01:27:35.570
There's a lot of Mexican converts down there as well.

1399
01:27:36.080 --> 01:27:39.860
And are there more than one family and more than one of these towns?
I think so.

1400
01:27:40.040 --> 01:27:43.520
Yeah.
Yeah,
there's a lot.
There's a lot of family names are in that region.

1401
01:27:43.521 --> 01:27:47.480
There are kind of famous,
you know why one of the barons or one of those,

1402
01:27:47.990 --> 01:27:52.250
but it's only this one town.
It's,
it's one upset.
There's,
there's a few out there,

1403
01:27:52.400 --> 01:27:54.320
there's a few others,
a few Mormon communities out there.

1404
01:27:54.380 --> 01:27:59.320
While it's all the same sort of deal arm to the tits discretely armed,

1405
01:27:59.360 --> 01:28:01.970
you know,
I don't know if it's open as it was,

1406
01:28:01.971 --> 01:28:05.660
but back then when it was really rowdy,
they were,

1407
01:28:05.720 --> 01:28:07.480
they were openly doing,
you know,

1408
01:28:08.000 --> 01:28:10.670
things to keep people from not coming to their town.

1409
01:28:10.730 --> 01:28:15.590
And they're full on Mexican citizens.
Yes.
Wow.
But they're,

1410
01:28:15.591 --> 01:28:18.350
but they speak English and they're white until it's,
they don't speak Spanish.

1411
01:28:19.040 --> 01:28:22.310
Some of them do,
but they don't need to because if they live in this community,

1412
01:28:22.311 --> 01:28:24.040
they don't go out of it a lot.
So,
you know,

1413
01:28:24.690 --> 01:28:28.730
it's a weird place that's fucking really weird.
Yeah,
yeah,

1414
01:28:30.050 --> 01:28:33.650
yeah.
Just like,
and when you,
when you're over here and you look at,

1415
01:28:33.660 --> 01:28:36.800
do you see it any differently from looking at this,

1416
01:28:36.940 --> 01:28:41.600
looking at the situation over there and how crazy Mexico is from America,

1417
01:28:41.750 --> 01:28:45.770
like how ignorant Americans are to how bad it really is.
Yeah.
I mean,
uh,

1418
01:28:45.980 --> 01:28:50.960
so I've been up here for
four years now as a resident,

1419
01:28:51.050 --> 01:28:52.460
right?
Uh,

1420
01:28:53.780 --> 01:28:56.570
and I came up here at the weirdest time,

1421
01:28:56.571 --> 01:28:59.510
probably in the u s history as far as,
you know,

1422
01:28:59.560 --> 01:29:04.230
when I was going through my immigration process,
uh,
Trump got elected.

1423
01:29:04.410 --> 01:29:08.820
So it was pretty interesting,
you know?
Um,
and,
uh,

1424
01:29:09.480 --> 01:29:12.060
you know,
being pulled to the both sides of the political spectrum,
you know,

1425
01:29:12.061 --> 01:29:17.061
you and seeing how people would talk about Mexico in ways that were like,

1426
01:29:17.310 --> 01:29:20.550
ew,
you realistic or you know,
just weird things that you would hear.

1427
01:29:20.551 --> 01:29:23.130
And it's like,
that's not how it is.
You know,
that's not how it happens.

1428
01:29:23.230 --> 01:29:27.810
What's a big misconception?
A,
that it's a Mexico problem.
Only in the,
that the,

1429
01:29:27.811 --> 01:29:31.080
the influence and the cartels aren't here in the US too.
You know,

1430
01:29:31.081 --> 01:29:34.260
they're all there everywhere outside the border.
The border thing is like,

1431
01:29:34.290 --> 01:29:36.570
that's the border,
but they're on both sides.
You know,

1432
01:29:36.571 --> 01:29:41.370
there's definitely cartel ear in the u.
So then,

1433
01:29:41.430 --> 01:29:45.720
um,
most Americans thinking,
thinking of it as a foreign problem.
It's foreign.

1434
01:29:45.721 --> 01:29:50.050
If you live far from the border,
maybe,
you know,
uh,
but you know,
it's,
it's,

1435
01:29:50.070 --> 01:29:54.690
it's everywhere.
It's everywhere.
Um,
that's one thing that I will see like,

1436
01:29:54.890 --> 01:29:58.020
oh,
and also that,
uh,

1437
01:29:58.290 --> 01:30:02.000
that it's a problem that Mexico she had fix itself,
you know,
that's a lot.

1438
01:30:02.001 --> 01:30:06.230
I also hear that know they should fix their own shit.
Yeah.
But their own them,

1439
01:30:06.240 --> 01:30:07.680
you know,
the problems down there,
you know,

1440
01:30:07.681 --> 01:30:12.681
stem from firearms and money coming from up here and big drug market and you

1441
01:30:14.400 --> 01:30:18.420
know,
the money going into some corrupt hands down there at times.

1442
01:30:18.450 --> 01:30:22.710
And then basically them burning the manual every six years.

1443
01:30:22.711 --> 01:30:25.700
I'd just starting a new on their fight and the car's.

1444
01:30:25.720 --> 01:30:28.020
Anybody else say this other than you?
Like,

1445
01:30:28.021 --> 01:30:32.280
does anybody say that politically over there?
I,
I,
there's a few people,

1446
01:30:32.550 --> 01:30:33.810
there's a few people.
Um,

1447
01:30:34.350 --> 01:30:39.300
I was actually in charge of the governor of Baja security detail towards,

1448
01:30:39.960 --> 01:30:42.470
for two years,
almost three years.
Uh,

1449
01:30:42.670 --> 01:30:47.670
I was put there because he was a very good friend of Philippe called the room.

1450
01:30:47.940 --> 01:30:51.680
He was his compadre and he was very high level and you know,

1451
01:30:51.690 --> 01:30:53.370
there was a lot of threats in his life.
And again,

1452
01:30:53.371 --> 01:30:57.450
he was heading up the tip of the spear for the counter and cartel operations and

1453
01:30:57.451 --> 01:30:58.320
the whole of Mexico.

1454
01:30:58.980 --> 01:31:02.770
And he implemented a plan and Tj that was then replicated throughout the,

1455
01:31:02.940 --> 01:31:07.080
the country.
And he would be very vocal in his,
you know,

1456
01:31:07.081 --> 01:31:11.670
counter cartel rhetoric and how we could do better in how we should all work

1457
01:31:11.671 --> 01:31:15.890
together.
He developed these groups called boom groups,
uh,

1458
01:31:16.590 --> 01:31:19.890
basically army,
municipal police,
state police,

1459
01:31:19.891 --> 01:31:22.920
all of them working together in these operations groups and just going out there

1460
01:31:22.921 --> 01:31:26.640
and it's the jurisdiction of everybody here to do whatever we need to do.

1461
01:31:27.540 --> 01:31:32.130
And he was pretty,
you know,
instrumental.
Um,
uh,
his name was,
um,

1462
01:31:33.120 --> 01:31:36.750
oh,
tsunami Yan and he's out of politics now.
Uh,

1463
01:31:37.470 --> 01:31:39.870
and he had a lot of threats on his life.
And,
uh,

1464
01:31:39.930 --> 01:31:41.730
it was pretty interesting working with mps.

1465
01:31:41.790 --> 01:31:44.940
One of those people think that all politicians are corrupt down there.

1466
01:31:44.941 --> 01:31:46.980
It's not true.
There's some good ones.
He was one,

1467
01:31:47.020 --> 01:31:49.890
definitely I'm back at work directly with him and I,
and I,

1468
01:31:49.891 --> 01:31:52.140
I could tell you that he was at,
he was one of those good ones.

1469
01:31:52.680 --> 01:31:55.480
And Lieutenant Colonel Leyzaola who's now running from [inaudible] wanna,

1470
01:31:55.500 --> 01:31:57.870
he's one of those vocal guys.
There's a reason why he's been,

1471
01:31:58.130 --> 01:32:01.780
they've tried to kill them nine times,
you know,
he's saying something,
you know,

1472
01:32:01.781 --> 01:32:04.530
he's,
he's represents something,
right.
Uh,

1473
01:32:04.540 --> 01:32:06.400
there are good people down there are willing to flight.

1474
01:32:06.430 --> 01:32:09.880
It's just that now there's a lot more bad people wanting to kill.

1475
01:32:10.180 --> 01:32:13.990
You must've seen some horrific shit over the course of your career.
Yeah.

1476
01:32:14.920 --> 01:32:19.750
Yes,
yes.
Uh,
bodies,
um,
the brutality,

1477
01:32:19.810 --> 01:32:23.200
torture,
all that,
all that type of stuff down there.
Again,

1478
01:32:23.201 --> 01:32:27.160
I tell people working down there as the closest thing to the wild west you have

1479
01:32:27.220 --> 01:32:28.750
currently,
it's basically,

1480
01:32:30.100 --> 01:32:33.790
and when the people say Third World country as there's a lot of cosmopolitan

1481
01:32:33.791 --> 01:32:34.930
places,
uh,

1482
01:32:34.990 --> 01:32:39.130
just across the border that aren't necessarily alien to Americanize.

1483
01:32:40.160 --> 01:32:43.240
Alright.
Yeah.
Now imagine all this,
you know,

1484
01:32:43.630 --> 01:32:48.570
crazy things happening down there.
Like,
um,
there was a famous fire fight,
uh,

1485
01:32:48.790 --> 01:32:51.340
in Tijuana.
Uh,
the cooler,

1486
01:32:51.640 --> 01:32:55.630
which is basically there was a big cartel stronghold inside of this castle type

1487
01:32:55.631 --> 01:33:00.220
thing.
You know,
they had a big giant dome on top of it.
Let cupela shoot out.

1488
01:33:00.730 --> 01:33:03.820
And when you,
when that happened,

1489
01:33:03.821 --> 01:33:07.580
basically a bunch of everybody responded to this thing and it was next to a

1490
01:33:07.581 --> 01:33:10.870
school and kids were being evacuated from and it was pretty horrific.

1491
01:33:11.650 --> 01:33:13.180
A lot of the people on the inside,

1492
01:33:13.210 --> 01:33:16.270
they had a lot of people abducted on the inside and they ha they basically

1493
01:33:16.300 --> 01:33:17.440
executed all of them.

1494
01:33:18.010 --> 01:33:21.280
And some of the people on the inside with the cartel guys would put zip ties on

1495
01:33:21.281 --> 01:33:23.480
themselves and you know,
kneel down on the ground.
So they would,

1496
01:33:23.530 --> 01:33:28.530
you would think it was them and you saw a uniformed police officers inside of

1497
01:33:28.661 --> 01:33:31.220
their shooting outside two uniform police officers.

1498
01:33:31.221 --> 01:33:34.870
So you would see how the crazy corruption and you know,

1499
01:33:36.850 --> 01:33:41.410
la shootout happens.
Bank robbery,
two guys with AK 47 north Hollywood,

1500
01:33:41.440 --> 01:33:45.160
that one militarize the whole policing in the United States.

1501
01:33:45.700 --> 01:33:50.140
That type of thing happens in t and ma in Mexico and Mexico every day.

1502
01:33:50.200 --> 01:33:53.200
And another gap is nothing changes.
You know,
that's,
that's,

1503
01:33:53.201 --> 01:33:56.200
that's great department and know how,
how something,

1504
01:33:56.201 --> 01:34:00.370
how that just is part of the normal now down there,
nothing changes.

1505
01:34:01.060 --> 01:34:05.980
No,
no adjustments,
no adjustments,
no evolution.

1506
01:34:06.040 --> 01:34:06.251
You know,

1507
01:34:06.251 --> 01:34:10.750
these guys used to roll around dressed as cops with Cleveland vehicles and now

1508
01:34:10.751 --> 01:34:15.680
they roll around in taxi cabs and are more discreet and how they move.
Um,

1509
01:34:15.730 --> 01:34:18.610
these guys used to use drug meals and drug tunnels.

1510
01:34:18.611 --> 01:34:23.611
Now they use a unmanned drones and other means to cross their drugs.

1511
01:34:23.671 --> 01:34:28.030
So they're always kind of evolving and adjusting and the government is trying to

1512
01:34:28.510 --> 01:34:32.590
smash it with a hammer for the past 10,
15,
20 years,

1513
01:34:32.800 --> 01:34:34.450
just whack them all like I'm on.

1514
01:34:35.710 --> 01:34:38.860
What made you start your Instagram account because your Instagram grounds

1515
01:34:38.980 --> 01:34:42.590
excellent.
It's Ed manifesto and it's all you,
you,

1516
01:34:42.650 --> 01:34:46.570
you talk so much about the problems that are going on over there and you also do

1517
01:34:46.571 --> 01:34:50.590
a lot of situational awareness stuff.
You show what's wrong with this picture?

1518
01:34:51.010 --> 01:34:55.630
What do you see here?
Yeah.
Uh,
main thing was when I started,

1519
01:34:55.631 --> 01:35:00.200
I was still active down there,
so it was kind of like a reporting,
you know,

1520
01:35:00.950 --> 01:35:05.150
so I was trying to share things with people to try and raise awareness,

1521
01:35:06.800 --> 01:35:11.800
but after that it became more of a thing of I just spent well over a decade

1522
01:35:12.111 --> 01:35:15.440
working in this environment down here and I have nothing to show for it.

1523
01:35:16.220 --> 01:35:20.560
So I need to take that experience and make it worth it for people at,

1524
01:35:20.680 --> 01:35:25.480
to share some of that experience with other people and to make it,
you know,

1525
01:35:26.130 --> 01:35:29.630
just to make it,
I had to justify it to myself,
just I need to make it worth,

1526
01:35:29.900 --> 01:35:32.780
worth the while worth my while to APP.
I haven't done that.

1527
01:35:33.500 --> 01:35:38.300
There's not a lot of people doing what you're doing though.
No,
no.
Uh,
I think,
uh,

1528
01:35:38.360 --> 01:35:39.110
the,
the,
the,

1529
01:35:39.110 --> 01:35:43.940
the strange thing about me is my English and the fact that I worked on the

1530
01:35:43.941 --> 01:35:48.110
border,
so I had the opportunity to cross that border and,
you know,

1531
01:35:49.010 --> 01:35:53.450
share some of those experience up here.
Like I've been to the FBI Academy,
uh,

1532
01:35:53.510 --> 01:35:54.650
surreal.
You know,

1533
01:35:54.830 --> 01:35:58.510
this kid from Tj is now at the FBI academy showing somewhere chits and where

1534
01:35:58.550 --> 01:36:02.750
people,
uh,
secret service a academy,
uh,

1535
01:36:02.780 --> 01:36:06.950
some of some of your SF guys have contact contacted me and I've done work for

1536
01:36:06.951 --> 01:36:11.810
them and I show him like,
wow,
like that a trick to get our handcuffs.

1537
01:36:11.810 --> 01:36:13.250
That's pretty cool.
Where did you learn that?

1538
01:36:13.251 --> 01:36:15.920
Like who showed you that 15 year old kid?
You know,

1539
01:36:15.921 --> 01:36:19.730
and Tj told me how to flip handcuffs and weaponize them.

1540
01:36:19.820 --> 01:36:23.480
That's pretty gnarly.
Fucked him and weaponize them.
Yeah.

1541
01:36:23.481 --> 01:36:25.380
So there's ways of uh,

1542
01:36:25.580 --> 01:36:29.590
releasing your handcuffs and flipping the side of the arm,
the handcuffs.

1543
01:36:29.591 --> 01:36:30.890
So it looks like it's still on,

1544
01:36:30.891 --> 01:36:34.160
but it isn't and somebody approaches you and you flip it open and use that thing

1545
01:36:34.161 --> 01:36:38.780
as a meat hook.
And a 15 year old kid showed me that after we applied,

1546
01:36:38.990 --> 01:36:40.730
tried to apply that on one of our guys.

1547
01:36:40.760 --> 01:36:43.780
And that's the stuff I wrote on in my little manifesto,

1548
01:36:43.781 --> 01:36:46.850
which was basically a manifest.
It was a,
uh,
a notebook.

1549
01:36:47.380 --> 01:36:50.300
I would write all these things down,
document most of them.

1550
01:36:50.870 --> 01:36:53.750
And when I would come over here to the u s to do training,

1551
01:36:53.751 --> 01:36:58.751
like I did some training with ensis in Coronado during my career and some of

1552
01:36:59.031 --> 01:37:01.490
those guys were a team that I seal guys.
That's how I met a few of them.

1553
01:37:02.300 --> 01:37:04.240
And they were like,
Hey ed.
Um,
yeah,

1554
01:37:04.250 --> 01:37:08.630
this is how we do a executive protection and in the Middle East.
And I was like,

1555
01:37:08.660 --> 01:37:13.280
wow,
that's how I do it.
Or I crossed the border right down here.
Why?
Yes.

1556
01:37:13.470 --> 01:37:18.320
What really?
Yeah.
Wow.
That's crazy.
God.
Yeah.

1557
01:37:18.321 --> 01:37:22.280
And we'd show them a flash drive with a bunch of pictures from stuff down there

1558
01:37:22.281 --> 01:37:27.281
and they would like be blown away by it and sharing information and kind of

1559
01:37:27.950 --> 01:37:31.610
basically making use of that experience.
A lot of people down there a mute,

1560
01:37:32.180 --> 01:37:35.120
they don't share that experience.
They don't think it's worth anything.

1561
01:37:35.180 --> 01:37:38.720
I think I realized that that experience in that gnarly place is worth something

1562
01:37:38.780 --> 01:37:43.130
to at least as far as sharing it.
Yeah.
Uh,
not a lot of people think that,

1563
01:37:43.310 --> 01:37:47.300
you know,
kind of,
you know,
we downplay ourselves.
We have this problem in Mexico.

1564
01:37:47.301 --> 01:37:51.590
Most Mexicans are very,
uh,
doubtful about themselves.
You know,
there's a,

1565
01:37:51.650 --> 01:37:52.730
like I would have Mexicans,

1566
01:37:52.731 --> 01:37:56.820
like what would we have to share with these high level guys?
You know,

1567
01:37:57.750 --> 01:38:02.700
and you know,
being in a place like that low means low equipment,
low training,

1568
01:38:02.701 --> 01:38:05.670
being creative.
That's a lot of things that come up from those,
uh,

1569
01:38:06.120 --> 01:38:10.380
that experience of being,
you know,
solution wise as far as,
you know,

1570
01:38:10.920 --> 01:38:12.090
keeping safe.
Well,

1571
01:38:12.091 --> 01:38:17.091
I think part of the problem with the United States and Mexico is our view of

1572
01:38:17.551 --> 01:38:19.890
Mexico and someone like you,

1573
01:38:19.930 --> 01:38:24.420
what you provide as a realistic perspective and real information,

1574
01:38:24.750 --> 01:38:29.520
real photographs,
real stories go and just enough.

1575
01:38:29.580 --> 01:38:33.420
And then this conversation,
just enough where enough people hear it.

1576
01:38:33.480 --> 01:38:35.400
It'll shift the,

1577
01:38:35.401 --> 01:38:39.420
the idea of what is happening in Mexico a little bit.
I mean,

1578
01:38:39.430 --> 01:38:44.430
I again thank you for this invitation and I thank you.
I have a,

1579
01:38:45.090 --> 01:38:45.923
like I,
I've,

1580
01:38:47.120 --> 01:38:51.270
I have this weird comparison than I have with you as far as this podcast.

1581
01:38:51.480 --> 01:38:55.010
I've listened to it way back when,
you know,
uh,
and I,

1582
01:38:55.011 --> 01:38:58.180
I remember this whole feeling of being around a campfire and hearing him,

1583
01:38:58.410 --> 01:39:01.170
people talk about their things and kind of,
you know,
passing the pipe.

1584
01:39:01.740 --> 01:39:03.510
That's pretty interesting.
That's something I've,

1585
01:39:03.590 --> 01:39:07.580
I've only kind of seen as far as it changing in the information of that look

1586
01:39:07.590 --> 01:39:08.190
like a,

1587
01:39:08.190 --> 01:39:13.190
around campfires are shamans or a sweat lodging type situations down there.

1588
01:39:14.010 --> 01:39:15.360
A lot of our guys were of native,

1589
01:39:15.390 --> 01:39:18.300
so w I would get invited to the sweat lodges and stuff like that.
You know,

1590
01:39:18.301 --> 01:39:20.450
you'll get that and change of information,
but yeah,

1591
01:39:20.490 --> 01:39:21.900
definitely start talking about it.

1592
01:39:22.410 --> 01:39:26.220
That's the first step in a lot of people don't want to talk about it because of

1593
01:39:26.221 --> 01:39:29.250
fear.
Now people are like,
Hey,
aren't you afraid of talking about this?

1594
01:39:29.760 --> 01:39:33.840
So I was afraid for 12 years.
Yes,
I am.
Uh,

1595
01:39:34.350 --> 01:39:38.650
but I,
I know that,
uh,
nobody else has gone into going to,
so like,

1596
01:39:39.540 --> 01:39:41.310
if not anybody else,
you know,
what,

1597
01:39:41.311 --> 01:39:43.830
if you stop and think about how many kinds of worked on the board or how many

1598
01:39:43.831 --> 01:39:48.180
guys have worked in these counter insurgency operations and how few are talking

1599
01:39:48.181 --> 01:39:51.300
about it or in how many of them died,
nobody knows who they are,

1600
01:39:52.080 --> 01:39:55.830
how many are still out there and nobody knows who they are or you know,
uh,

1601
01:39:56.610 --> 01:40:00.810
Sicario that movie.
SICARIO yeah.
Those people are looking at that movie.

1602
01:40:00.840 --> 01:40:02.690
It's a lot of the followers,
just suspicious of that.

1603
01:40:02.750 --> 01:40:04.350
An ETL total having an MP five,

1604
01:40:04.410 --> 01:40:07.650
I was the only Mexican rockin and MP five submachine gun down there.
Right.

1605
01:40:07.651 --> 01:40:11.730
So it's like,
is that,
you know,
what did you think of those movies?
Oh,
horrible,

1606
01:40:13.440 --> 01:40:18.210
horrible,
unrealistic.
You know,
they should,
hey,
if somebody doesn't hire,
hired me,

1607
01:40:18.211 --> 01:40:19.890
I'll do it for free just to,
you know,

1608
01:40:20.220 --> 01:40:23.280
I'll consult for free on that and I'll make it look a little bit more closer to

1609
01:40:23.281 --> 01:40:27.270
what it is.
Uh,
but it's,
uh,
the main thing is how,

1610
01:40:27.300 --> 01:40:30.990
how w everybody saw that movie and that,
that's how they would,
you know,
that's,

1611
01:40:30.991 --> 01:40:35.310
that's the reality,
you know,
how fiction is kind of a basis for reality.

1612
01:40:35.640 --> 01:40:40.410
So sicario two comes out and it's basically the United States declaring the

1613
01:40:40.411 --> 01:40:44.850
cartels are terrorist organization,
you know,
and I saw that and I was like,
hmm.

1614
01:40:46.200 --> 01:40:49.940
Usually fiction kind of pre kind of has a,
uh,

1615
01:40:49.960 --> 01:40:52.620
a way of influencing reality.
Further on the line,

1616
01:40:52.800 --> 01:40:57.800
you that a Denzel Washington movie called siege where the budget terrorist

1617
01:40:58.061 --> 01:41:00.130
attack in New York and then militarized New York,

1618
01:41:00.131 --> 01:41:04.870
and that's kind of like a precedent for nine 11.
So you'd see sicario too.

1619
01:41:04.871 --> 01:41:06.630
And then,
you know,
we're going to terrorist,

1620
01:41:06.640 --> 01:41:11.640
the prompt now says they're going to thinking about declaring the cartels as a

1621
01:41:12.071 --> 01:41:15.980
terrorist organization.
That's pretty interesting.
Uh,

1622
01:41:16.270 --> 01:41:21.270
mainly because realistically Mexico has been calling them terrorists forever.

1623
01:41:23.000 --> 01:41:25.450
You know?
What did you think about that,
about Trump doing that?

1624
01:41:25.470 --> 01:41:28.530
Do you think that that actually is something that could happen?
Uh,
if,
if,

1625
01:41:28.550 --> 01:41:31.600
if you're going to militarize efforts against it and not just to consider it as

1626
01:41:31.601 --> 01:41:33.010
a law enforcement type situations,

1627
01:41:33.370 --> 01:41:37.570
I think that people should be afraid down there if you do go that route.

1628
01:41:38.560 --> 01:41:42.310
But just realize that's going to be open warfare,
not in a foreign country,

1629
01:41:42.311 --> 01:41:44.800
across the ocean.
It's going to be right next to your border.
Yeah.

1630
01:41:44.801 --> 01:41:46.630
Where people can walk across yes.

1631
01:41:46.780 --> 01:41:51.550
Or make things happen now in there that will affect you up here in a very real

1632
01:41:51.551 --> 01:41:56.410
way,
you know,
and it'll get ugly before it gets better.
Uh,
you know,
I,

1633
01:41:56.510 --> 01:41:59.530
I,
hopefully it doesn't,
you know,
but that's realistic,

1634
01:41:59.540 --> 01:42:00.640
that if that doesn't happen,

1635
01:42:00.641 --> 01:42:04.810
if they don't treat it as a terrorist organization and try to have some sort of

1636
01:42:04.870 --> 01:42:07.330
impact on it,
what could be done?
I mean,
I think,

1637
01:42:07.360 --> 01:42:12.010
I think culturally they're trying to get us ready for that,
you know?

1638
01:42:12.760 --> 01:42:15.730
I don't know.
I mean,
I think that's what's,
that's what's happening.

1639
01:42:16.040 --> 01:42:18.340
And you'll see a lot of the cross,
you know,

1640
01:42:18.550 --> 01:42:23.170
borders a US military assets training,

1641
01:42:23.200 --> 01:42:23.890
uh,

1642
01:42:23.890 --> 01:42:28.210
Mexican marines down there and having a open relationship with them.

1643
01:42:28.840 --> 01:42:32.410
You see that and that the push is to maybe,
you know,

1644
01:42:32.530 --> 01:42:35.440
preparing for something.
You know,
I think they're preparing for something.

1645
01:42:35.441 --> 01:42:38.140
You know,
what,
what could that be?
I don't know.
So the,

1646
01:42:38.141 --> 01:42:43.141
what we get about it publicly is just a small sliver of the actual conversations

1647
01:42:43.871 --> 01:42:47.440
that are being had.
Yeah.
And also there's a lot of,
you know,
misdirection,

1648
01:42:47.750 --> 01:42:52.600
you know,
there's a lot of misdirection.
I that I'm personally,
yeah.

1649
01:42:52.930 --> 01:42:53.651
