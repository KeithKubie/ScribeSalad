Intro
There's never been a higher demand for diversity

00:00:11.430 --> 00:00:15.209
in Hollywood movies, from biopics to superhero
blockbusters.

00:00:15.209 --> 00:00:20.100
But movie fans know that whether the studio
intends it or not, some of the most offensive

00:00:20.100 --> 00:00:23.270
castings can leave audiences wondering why
anyone ever thought it was a good idea.

00:00:23.270 --> 00:00:26.650
Here are 10 Racist Casting Decisions in Movies.

00:00:26.650 --> 00:00:29.410
Aloha
The movie disappeared from theaters in no

00:00:29.410 --> 00:00:31.030
time, and for a few reasons.

00:00:31.030 --> 00:00:35.820
One of the most controversial was the decision
to cast actress Emma Stone as Captain Allison

00:00:35.820 --> 00:00:39.960
Ng ("eng") - a woman who reminds a few people
in the movie that she's one quarter Hawaiian,

00:00:39.960 --> 00:00:41.579
and one quarter Chinese.

00:00:41.579 --> 00:00:46.210
The director eventually apologized, and Stone
herself regretted being miscast, but the lack

00:00:46.210 --> 00:00:51.380
of ethnic diversity in the films version of
Hawaii wound up being just as criticized.

00:00:51.380 --> 00:00:54.329
Prince of Persia
The title of this video game movie tells you

00:00:54.329 --> 00:00:56.710
all you need to know about the hero, Dastan.

00:00:56.710 --> 00:01:01.180
But when Jake Gyllenhaal landed the lead part,
people had to ask if the studio realized such

00:01:01.180 --> 00:01:05.129
a whitewashed hero in middle eastern costume
seemed pulled from the 1930s.

00:01:05.129 --> 00:01:08.200
Then again, Dastan WAS adopted...

00:01:08.200 --> 00:01:10.259
But this decision still stinks.

00:01:10.259 --> 00:01:12.690
Lone Ranger
There was a time when people claimed that

00:01:12.690 --> 00:01:14.890
there was NO role Johnny Depp couldn't play.

00:01:14.890 --> 00:01:19.100
But when he was announced to be playing the
Native American Tonto in Disney's Lone Ranger,

00:01:19.100 --> 00:01:23.689
the reveal of his stereotypical clothing,
dialogue, and antics turned audiences against

00:01:23.689 --> 00:01:25.780
the project before it was even finished.

00:01:25.780 --> 00:01:29.840
It may have been meant as a throwback to the
original series, but some relics of the past

00:01:29.840 --> 00:01:31.990
are left behind for a reason.

00:01:31.990 --> 00:01:35.690
Avatar The Last Airbender
Take your pick on M Night Shyamalan's adaptation

00:01:35.690 --> 00:01:40.180
of the hit Nickelodeon cartoon, since the
show's twists on human civilizations and geography

00:01:40.180 --> 00:01:43.010
made the implied races of the different tribes
pretty obvious.

00:01:43.010 --> 00:01:47.540
Had the cast adapted the Chinese, Japanese,
Himalayan and Inuit characters of the show,

00:01:47.540 --> 00:01:49.730
it could have been both faithful and progressive.

00:01:49.730 --> 00:01:53.250
But casting white actors in basically every
role except the Villain...

00:01:53.250 --> 00:01:56.800
Confused as many fans as it outraged - with
good reason.

00:01:56.800 --> 00:01:59.440
Pan
The trip back to Neverland was a disappointment

00:01:59.440 --> 00:02:03.670
for the studio, but it did try to share Peter
Pan's spotlight with Captain Hook, Blackbeard

00:02:03.670 --> 00:02:04.810
and Tiger Lily.

00:02:04.810 --> 00:02:08.610
The first sign of trouble came when actress
Rooney Mara was cast as the Native leader

00:02:08.610 --> 00:02:09.610
instead of a...

00:02:09.610 --> 00:02:11.409
Well, Native American actress.

00:02:11.409 --> 00:02:12.939
But it definitely wasn't the last.

00:02:12.939 --> 00:02:16.659
Exodus: Gods and Kings
Plenty of movie fans would line up to see

00:02:16.659 --> 00:02:20.840
Christian Bale and Joel Edgerton play adoptive
brothers at war - but when the brothers are

00:02:20.840 --> 00:02:25.189
Moses and Ramses in a biblical epic, things
are a bit more complicated.

00:02:25.189 --> 00:02:28.779
Director Ridley Scott addressed the presumed
whitewashing of Biblical roles by saying the

00:02:28.779 --> 00:02:33.120
studio wouldn't have funded the film with
ethnically accurate leading actors - explaining

00:02:33.120 --> 00:02:38.140
his mainly white cast... and raising an even
uglier issue about Hollywood casting.

00:02:38.140 --> 00:02:41.019
Gods of Egypt
From the title, most audiences would expect

00:02:41.019 --> 00:02:44.069
to see Egyptian God's brought to life as...
well, Egyptian.

00:02:44.069 --> 00:02:48.109
Or, failing that, not just a bunch if white
guys stomping around ancient Egypt playing

00:02:48.109 --> 00:02:49.109
deities.

00:02:49.109 --> 00:02:52.189
That's what they got, though, and the studio
and director apologized.

00:02:52.189 --> 00:02:56.389
Even actor Chadwick Boseman admitted the lack
of diversity was why he joined the cast at

00:02:56.389 --> 00:03:01.299
all, citing the same preferences for white
leads among Hollywood studios.

00:03:01.299 --> 00:03:03.599
Avatar
It's no secret that Avatar's story draws as

00:03:03.599 --> 00:03:07.801
much on the colonization of the new world
as Pocahontas, Dances with Wolves, and too

00:03:07.801 --> 00:03:09.379
many other stories to count.

00:03:09.379 --> 00:03:13.099
But you can't accuse the studio of racist
casting if the "people of color" in the movie

00:03:13.099 --> 00:03:14.340
are BLUE, can you?

00:03:14.340 --> 00:03:18.639
Well, once people noticed most of the heroic
cast was white, and the leaders of the primitive

00:03:18.639 --> 00:03:19.639
Na'vi were played by Zoe Saldana, CCH Pounder,
Wes Studi ("Stoo-dee"), and Laz Alonso - all

00:03:19.639 --> 00:03:23.889
African American or Native American - the
questions started to rise.

00:03:23.889 --> 00:03:27.329
But a massive box office haul drowned most
of them out.

00:03:27.329 --> 00:03:30.659
Memoirs of a Geisha
Whitewashing isn't the only kind of racist

00:03:30.659 --> 00:03:32.529
casting studios need to worry about.

00:03:32.529 --> 00:03:36.930
The adaptation of this novel also followed
a Japanese girl from childhood - but outraged

00:03:36.930 --> 00:03:41.340
Japanese audiences when the main roles were
filled with Chinese, or ethnically Chinese

00:03:41.340 --> 00:03:42.340
actresses.

00:03:42.340 --> 00:03:46.109
It's obvious why an outcry arose, but the
historical and racial criticisms of the novel

00:03:46.109 --> 00:03:49.769
may have played a part - since some of the
filmmakers claimed that not many Japanese

00:03:49.769 --> 00:03:53.430
actresses actually showed interest in playing
the characters.

00:03:53.430 --> 00:03:56.700
Tropic Thunder
The idea of a comedy showing a method actor

00:03:56.700 --> 00:04:01.400
willing to dye his skin and play a stereotype
was risky to begin with, but in Tropic Thunder,

00:04:01.400 --> 00:04:04.760
Robert Downey, Jr. won over most critics as
Kirk Lazarus - or Staff Sargent Lincoln Osiris.

00:04:04.760 --> 00:04:08.489
But for those who felt there was no good reason
to put an actor in black face - self aware

00:04:08.489 --> 00:04:13.269
or not - Downey's nomination for a best supporting
actor Oscar was as outrageous as anything

00:04:13.269 --> 00:04:14.269
in the film itself.

00:04:14.269 --> 00:04:16.449
Conclusion&nbsp;
Those are just a sample of the truly shocking

00:04:16.449 --> 00:04:19.380
racist castings made in Hollywood today, but
which ones have we missed?
