00:00:05.330 --> 00:00:12.770
For me these hard problems to be able to approach
them with the intention of alleviating suffering

00:00:12.770 --> 00:00:22.289
in a large patient population, and globally
– the opportunity to create accessible,

00:00:22.289 --> 00:00:28.349
safe and efficacious products to go after
and train, to unlock the body’s immune system

00:00:28.349 --> 00:00:31.619
and actually solve these problems ourselves
is amazing.

00:00:31.619 --> 00:00:38.560
So by turning the body into the drug factory
(because it’s naturally producing these

00:00:38.560 --> 00:00:42.900
endobodies), I think that’s a revolution
in terms of the way we’re going to approach

00:00:42.900 --> 00:00:45.160
chronic illness.

00:00:45.160 --> 00:00:47.330
And so I’m pretty excited about that part.

00:00:47.330 --> 00:00:49.260
So these are all vaccine based approaches.

00:00:49.260 --> 00:00:56.540
What I like about vaccines is that if we can
turn your body on to activate against something

00:00:56.540 --> 00:01:04.140
that is an agent of pain that your body itself
is generating, then you can have a very easy

00:01:04.140 --> 00:01:09.250
way to take the product – it’s a single
shot once a year, potentially.

00:01:09.250 --> 00:01:14.780
So you have a great compliance rate with your
patients, so it’s easy on your patient.

00:01:14.780 --> 00:01:18.670
The cost is absolutely affordable and attainable.

00:01:18.670 --> 00:01:23.460
So the cost becomes something that is accessible.

00:01:23.460 --> 00:01:29.200
And you are in effect having a long duration
of that treatment.

00:01:29.200 --> 00:01:33.630
That’s going to give us the best chances
to, in my opinion anyway, it’s going to

00:01:33.630 --> 00:01:38.409
be one of the approaches that maximize our
chances against the opioids and against the

00:01:38.409 --> 00:01:41.030
epidemic that’s outstanding.

00:01:41.030 --> 00:01:48.280
In addition to that we have some other things
in our pipeline that are focused on the absorption

00:01:48.280 --> 00:01:54.160
of opioids or the replacement of opioids from
a pleasure perspective.

00:01:54.160 --> 00:01:58.620
That’s earlier and so not really worth incorporating
into what we’re doing here, but it would

00:01:58.620 --> 00:02:00.640
be in like soon.

00:02:00.640 --> 00:02:02.170
Those first two are big.

00:02:02.170 --> 00:02:07.870
So, for example, we have an IL-6 vaccine that
I’m really excited about.

00:02:07.870 --> 00:02:13.350
And there are indications surrounding sciatica
there that are really compelling.

00:02:13.350 --> 00:02:19.069
And I think that that’s a huge need in terms
of being able to remove that suffering and

00:02:19.069 --> 00:02:25.030
that pain in a long-acting, affordable, and
accessible way.

00:02:25.030 --> 00:02:26.110
So that’s an example.

00:02:26.110 --> 00:02:30.760
Another one is, there’s been a lot of noise
around CGRP and monoclonal antibodies that

00:02:30.760 --> 00:02:34.690
have been improved around that for migraine.

00:02:34.690 --> 00:02:39.920
And we’ve got a vaccine for CGRP that we’re
extremely excited about, and if you think

00:02:39.920 --> 00:02:44.840
about the benefits of that it means that—one
of the big problems with getting people to

00:02:44.840 --> 00:02:48.550
take drugs is when they feel better they don’t
want to take them.

00:02:48.550 --> 00:02:53.880
But if your body is fighting that same target
then you don’t have that same compliance

00:02:53.880 --> 00:02:54.880
issue.

00:02:54.880 --> 00:02:59.090
And so you actually make it easier for the
patients to take the products that they’re

00:02:59.090 --> 00:03:04.239
supposed to take in a timely manner and then
maintain the benefits of those products.

00:03:04.239 --> 00:03:09.340
So I think that’s going to be a really interesting
product that we’re going to bring to market

00:03:09.340 --> 00:03:11.400
and I think that’s a huge need.

00:03:11.400 --> 00:03:17.910
And there’s a bunch of indications around
that that are in the pipeline for the non-opioid

00:03:17.910 --> 00:03:20.319
pain alternative, so it’s pretty exciting
and it’s cool.

00:03:20.319 --> 00:03:29.640
You have unbelievable rates of overdose happening
in this country that are unprecedented.

00:03:29.640 --> 00:03:35.160
And we have an opportunity to—some of that
is driven by genuine need and pain.

00:03:35.160 --> 00:03:39.099
And so some of those alternatives which are
not particularly effective (and there’s

00:03:39.099 --> 00:03:43.270
been more studies coming out around this over
and over and over again) that I think we can

00:03:43.270 --> 00:03:46.590
find more effective alternatives that are
safer than opioids.

00:03:46.590 --> 00:03:51.610
And I think that’s really one of the other
focuses of United Neuroscience and something

00:03:51.610 --> 00:03:58.160
that I’m personally passionate about, because
the Alzheimer’s and the unintentional deaths

00:03:58.160 --> 00:04:03.040
statistics are what are driving down our longevity
for the first time in there consecutive years

00:04:03.040 --> 00:04:04.500
since the Spanish flu.

00:04:04.500 --> 00:04:13.100
So we should, morally, and we are, practically,
focused on addressing those biggest possible

00:04:13.100 --> 00:04:14.110
problems.

00:04:14.110 --> 00:04:19.989
So it’s only consistent and it’s only
right that we’re also dedicating some resource

00:04:19.989 --> 00:04:25.310
and time and energy to addressing both the
Alzheimer’s epidemic, the Parkinson’s

00:04:25.310 --> 00:04:28.749
epidemic, and also the non-opioid pain epidemic.

00:04:28.749 --> 00:04:39.590
When we look at this going forward, just to
underline it I guess, these are diseases that

00:04:39.590 --> 00:04:40.969
don’t discriminate.

00:04:40.969 --> 00:04:44.300
I can’t articulate that enough.

00:04:44.300 --> 00:04:45.469
These diseases don’t discriminate.

00:04:45.469 --> 00:04:47.389
They don’t care how much money you have.

00:04:47.389 --> 00:04:48.979
They don’t care where you live.

00:04:48.979 --> 00:04:51.960
They don’t care what color your skin is.

00:04:51.960 --> 00:04:56.599
And the bottom line is that our medicines
can’t discriminate either.

00:04:56.599 --> 00:05:01.379
And so our platform technology enables us
to be accessible.

00:05:01.379 --> 00:05:06.800
It enables us to actually go where the need
is.

00:05:06.800 --> 00:05:11.319
And for that I’m eternally optimistic.

00:05:11.319 --> 00:05:13.579
So that’s pretty much it.
