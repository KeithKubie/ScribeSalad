health care and if you say to me what's

00:00:17.060 --> 00:00:17.070
health care and if you say to me what's

recognize that we do not allow that in
 

00:01:52.890 --> 00:01:55.039
recognize that we do not allow that in
most circumstances and the result is

00:01:55.039 --> 00:01:55.049
most circumstances and the result is
 

00:01:55.049 --> 00:01:56.389
most circumstances and the result is
that those people are not treated well

00:01:56.389 --> 00:01:56.399
that those people are not treated well
 

00:01:56.399 --> 00:01:58.130
that those people are not treated well
they wind up with complications with

00:01:58.130 --> 00:01:58.140
they wind up with complications with
 

00:01:58.140 --> 00:02:01.010
they wind up with complications with
very severe effects afterwards and the

00:02:01.010 --> 00:02:01.020
very severe effects afterwards and the
 

00:02:01.020 --> 00:02:03.649
very severe effects afterwards and the
whole system dysfunction is poorly we

00:02:03.649 --> 00:02:03.659
whole system dysfunction is poorly we
 

00:02:03.659 --> 00:02:05.599
whole system dysfunction is poorly we
need a health care system that's focused

00:02:05.599 --> 00:02:05.609
need a health care system that's focused
 

00:02:05.609 --> 00:02:09.139
need a health care system that's focused
around helping the patient and if that

around helping the patient and if that
 

00:02:09.149 --> 00:02:10.219
around helping the patient and if that
means that there's a nurse practitioner

00:02:10.219 --> 00:02:10.229
means that there's a nurse practitioner
 

00:02:10.229 --> 00:02:13.160
means that there's a nurse practitioner
who's there to help you out a great if

00:02:13.160 --> 00:02:13.170
who's there to help you out a great if
 

00:02:13.170 --> 00:02:14.840
who's there to help you out a great if
that means that that there's a

00:02:14.840 --> 00:02:14.850
that means that that there's a
 

00:02:14.850 --> 00:02:16.700
that means that that there's a
physician's assistant or a group visit

00:02:16.700 --> 00:02:16.710
physician's assistant or a group visit
 

00:02:16.710 --> 00:02:17.990
physician's assistant or a group visit
with lots of other people figured out

00:02:17.990 --> 00:02:18.000
with lots of other people figured out
 

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:19.699
with lots of other people figured out
how to do that then that's what we have

00:02:19.699 --> 00:02:19.709
how to do that then that's what we have
 

00:02:19.709 --> 00:02:20.960
how to do that then that's what we have
to enable

00:02:20.960 --> 00:02:20.970
to enable
 

00:02:20.970 --> 00:02:24.620
to enable
so far we almost prohibited we don't

00:02:24.620 --> 00:02:24.630
so far we almost prohibited we don't
 

00:02:24.630 --> 00:02:26.480
so far we almost prohibited we don't
help it we're not even neutral we

00:02:26.480 --> 00:02:26.490
help it we're not even neutral we
 

00:02:26.490 --> 00:02:28.280
help it we're not even neutral we
basically say we're not going to allow

00:02:28.280 --> 00:02:28.290
basically say we're not going to allow
 

00:02:28.290 --> 00:02:30.710
basically say we're not going to allow
that which is just a huge huge mistake

00:02:30.710 --> 00:02:30.720
that which is just a huge huge mistake
 

00:02:30.720 --> 00:02:32.480
that which is just a huge huge mistake
and it's something that's going to have

00:02:32.480 --> 00:02:32.490
and it's something that's going to have
 

00:02:32.490 --> 00:02:34.400
and it's something that's going to have
to be have to be very different or else

00:02:34.400 --> 00:02:34.410
to be have to be very different or else
 

00:02:34.410 --> 00:02:35.960
to be have to be very different or else
we're never going to make a lot of

00:02:35.960 --> 00:02:35.970
we're never going to make a lot of
 

00:02:35.970 --> 00:02:40.430
we're never going to make a lot of
progress

00:02:40.430 --> 00:02:40.440
 

00:02:40.440 --> 00:02:42.950
a lot of the innovations in health care

00:02:42.950 --> 00:02:42.960
a lot of the innovations in health care
 

00:02:42.960 --> 00:02:44.720
a lot of the innovations in health care
recently have come from a couple of

00:02:44.720 --> 00:02:44.730
recently have come from a couple of
 

00:02:44.730 --> 00:02:49.070
recently have come from a couple of
places one is the kind of analyst

00:02:49.070 --> 00:02:49.080
places one is the kind of analyst
 

00:02:49.080 --> 00:02:50.750
places one is the kind of analyst

change in thinking since since the the
 

00:02:53.220 --> 00:02:54.860
change in thinking since since the the
past reform effort 16 years ago where

00:02:54.860 --> 00:02:54.870
past reform effort 16 years ago where
 

00:02:54.870 --> 00:02:56.200
past reform effort 16 years ago where
you know have much more attention

00:02:56.200 --> 00:02:56.210
you know have much more attention
 

00:02:56.210 --> 00:02:58.340
you know have much more attention
information technology and how you'd

00:02:58.340 --> 00:02:58.350
information technology and how you'd
 

00:02:58.350 --> 00:02:59.810
information technology and how you'd
eliminate waste and so on none of what

00:02:59.810 --> 00:02:59.820
eliminate waste and so on none of what
 

00:02:59.820 --> 00:03:02.390

you saw and then the what's very

00:03:02.390 --> 00:03:02.400
you saw and then the what's very
 

00:03:02.400 --> 00:03:03.640
you saw and then the what's very
interesting is the provider community

00:03:03.640 --> 00:03:03.650
interesting is the provider community
 

00:03:03.650 --> 00:03:06.710
interesting is the provider community
has a number and insurer community for

00:03:06.710 --> 00:03:06.720
has a number and insurer community for
 

00:03:06.720 --> 00:03:08.240
has a number and insurer community for
that matter has a number of very

00:03:08.240 --> 00:03:08.250
that matter has a number of very
 

00:03:08.250 --> 00:03:10.730
that matter has a number of very
progressive elements groups that are out

00:03:10.730 --> 00:03:10.740
progressive elements groups that are out

progressive elements groups that are out
there saying you know what we're just

00:03:13.400 --> 00:03:13.410
there saying you know what we're just
 

00:03:13.410 --> 00:03:15.860
there saying you know what we're just
not going to tolerate patients getting

00:03:15.860 --> 00:03:15.870
not going to tolerate patients getting
 

00:03:15.870 --> 00:03:18.050
