00:00:00.530 --> 00:00:03.050
- [Instructor] Let R be
the region enclosed by

00:00:03.050 --> 00:00:07.220
y is equal to four times the
square root of nine minus x

00:00:07.220 --> 00:00:09.510
and the axes in the first quadrant.

00:00:09.510 --> 00:00:12.650
And we can see that region
R is gray right over here.

00:00:12.650 --> 00:00:16.120
Region R is the base of a solid.

00:00:16.120 --> 00:00:20.460
For each y-value the cross
section of the solid taken

00:00:20.460 --> 00:00:25.170
perpendicular to the y-axis
is a rectangle whose base

00:00:25.170 --> 00:00:28.250
lies in R and whose height is y.

00:00:28.250 --> 00:00:32.230
Express the volume of the
solid with a definite integral.

00:00:32.230 --> 00:00:34.603
So pause this video and
see if you can do that.

00:00:35.900 --> 00:00:37.590
Alright, now let's do this together.

00:00:37.590 --> 00:00:40.310
And first let's just try
to visualize the solid

00:00:40.310 --> 00:00:41.910
and I'll try to do it by drawing

00:00:43.090 --> 00:00:44.280
this little bit of perspective.

00:00:44.280 --> 00:00:46.250
So if that's our y-axis

00:00:46.250 --> 00:00:51.250
and then this is our
x-axis right over here.

00:00:52.130 --> 00:00:56.650
And I can redraw region R,
looks something like this.

00:00:56.650 --> 00:01:00.840
And now let's just imagine a
cross section of our solid.

00:01:00.840 --> 00:01:02.970
So it says the cross section solid

00:01:02.970 --> 00:01:05.030
taken perpendicular to the y-axis,

00:01:05.030 --> 00:01:06.590
so let's pick a y-value right over here.

00:01:06.590 --> 00:01:09.080
We're gonna go
perpendicular to the y-axis.

00:01:09.080 --> 00:01:12.370
It says whose base lies in R.

00:01:12.370 --> 00:01:14.320
So the base would look like that,

00:01:14.320 --> 00:01:16.570
it would actually be the
x-value that corresponds

00:01:16.570 --> 00:01:18.130
to that particular y-value.

00:01:18.130 --> 00:01:19.920
So I'll just write x right over here.

00:01:19.920 --> 00:01:23.190
And then the height is y.

00:01:23.190 --> 00:01:28.190
So the height is goin'a be
whatever our y-value is.

00:01:28.650 --> 00:01:31.640
And then if we wanted to
calculate the volume of

00:01:31.640 --> 00:01:36.270
just a little bit, a slice that
has an infinitesimal depth,

00:01:36.270 --> 00:01:40.810
we could think about that
infinitesimal depth in terms of y.

00:01:40.810 --> 00:01:45.610
So we could say its depth,
right over here, is d y.

00:01:45.610 --> 00:01:48.150
D y, and we could draw
other cross sections.

00:01:48.150 --> 00:01:51.150
For example, right over
here, our y is much lower,

00:01:51.150 --> 00:01:53.620
it might look some, so our
height will be like that.

00:01:53.620 --> 00:01:58.620
But then our base is the
corresponding x-value

00:01:58.710 --> 00:02:01.660
that sits on the curve
right over that x y pair,

00:02:01.660 --> 00:02:02.990
that would sit on that curve.

00:02:02.990 --> 00:02:06.770
And so this cross section
would look like this.

00:02:06.770 --> 00:02:08.860
And once again, if we wanted to put,

00:02:08.860 --> 00:02:10.120
if we wanted to calculate its volume,

00:02:10.120 --> 00:02:12.855
we could say there's
an infinitesimal volume

00:02:12.855 --> 00:02:14.480
and it would have depth d y.

00:02:14.480 --> 00:02:17.580
And so as we've learned
many times in integration,

00:02:17.580 --> 00:02:19.110
what we wanna do is
think about the volume of

00:02:19.110 --> 00:02:21.770
one of these, I guess
you could say, slices,

00:02:21.770 --> 00:02:24.260
and then integrate across all of them.

00:02:24.260 --> 00:02:25.880
Now there's a couple
of ways to approach it.

00:02:25.880 --> 00:02:28.170
You could try to integrate
with respect to x,

00:02:28.170 --> 00:02:30.630
or you could integrate with respect to y.

00:02:30.630 --> 00:02:32.840
I'm gonna argue it's much
easier to integrate with respect

00:02:32.840 --> 00:02:35.770
to y here 'cause we already
have things in terms of d y.

00:02:35.770 --> 00:02:37.590
The volume of this little slice

00:02:37.590 --> 00:02:42.500
is going to be y times x times d y.

00:02:42.500 --> 00:02:44.850
Now if wanna integrate with respect to y,

00:02:44.850 --> 00:02:46.973
we want everything in terms of y.

00:02:47.892 --> 00:02:51.140
And so what you do is
express x in terms of y.

00:02:51.140 --> 00:02:53.510
So here we just have to solve for x,

00:02:53.510 --> 00:02:55.530
so one way to do this is, let's see,

00:02:55.530 --> 00:02:58.120
we can square both sides of,

00:02:58.120 --> 00:03:00.160
oh, actually let's divide
both sides by four.

00:03:00.160 --> 00:03:03.200
So you get y over four is equal to

00:03:03.200 --> 00:03:05.100
the square root of nine minus x.

00:03:05.100 --> 00:03:06.940
Now we can square both sides.

00:03:06.940 --> 00:03:11.320
Y squared over 16 is
equal to nine minus x.

00:03:11.320 --> 00:03:13.760
And then, let's see, we could

00:03:13.760 --> 00:03:16.190
multiply both sides by negative one.

00:03:16.190 --> 00:03:18.840
So negative y squared over 16

00:03:18.840 --> 00:03:20.640
is equal to x minus nine.

00:03:20.640 --> 00:03:22.540
And now we could add nine to both sides.

00:03:22.540 --> 00:03:27.540
And we get nine minus y
squared over 16 is equal to x.

00:03:27.760 --> 00:03:30.130
And so we could substitute
that right over there.

00:03:30.130 --> 00:03:33.150
So another way to express
the volume of this little

00:03:33.150 --> 00:03:36.080
slice right over here
of infinitesimal depth,

00:03:36.080 --> 00:03:38.180
d y depth, is going to be

00:03:38.180 --> 00:03:43.130
y times nine minus y squared

00:03:43.130 --> 00:03:46.020
over 16 d y.

00:03:46.020 --> 00:03:49.380
And if we wanna find the
volume of the whole figure,

00:03:49.380 --> 00:03:51.490
it's gonna look something like,

00:03:51.490 --> 00:03:55.761
something like that, we're
just goin'a integrate

00:03:55.761 --> 00:03:59.240
from y equals zero to y is equal to 12.

00:03:59.240 --> 00:04:01.770
So integrate from y is equal to zero

00:04:01.770 --> 00:04:03.780
to y is equal to 12.

00:04:03.780 --> 00:04:05.390
And that's all they asked us to do

00:04:05.390 --> 00:04:07.810
to express the volume
as a definite integral,

00:04:07.810 --> 00:04:09.330
but this is actually a definite integral

00:04:09.330 --> 00:04:12.170
that you could solve without a calculator.

00:04:12.170 --> 00:04:16.720
If you multiply both of these terms by y,

00:04:16.720 --> 00:04:19.210
well then you're just goin'a
have a polynomial in terms of y

00:04:19.210 --> 00:04:22.360
and we know how to take
the antiderivative of that

00:04:22.360 --> 00:04:24.260
and then evaluate a definite integral.
