&gt;&gt; From the Library of
Congress in Washington DC.

00:00:05.510 --> 00:00:14.130
[ Music ]

00:00:14.130 --> 00:00:18.590
&gt;&gt; Helena Zinkham: The Library
has a new hashtag, called LCPride.

00:00:18.590 --> 00:00:24.310
That's because we're holding a very
special event in Pride month 2017.

00:00:24.310 --> 00:00:28.770
We've brought out almost 200
items from the collections.

00:00:28.770 --> 00:00:31.730
Rich, diverse resources
in every format

00:00:31.730 --> 00:00:33.730
of information you could think of.

00:00:33.730 --> 00:00:38.640
From brail books and talking books
to rare books and manuscripts.

00:00:38.640 --> 00:00:42.790
It's all about the American
experience in community

00:00:42.790 --> 00:00:46.270
with all the international
connections.

00:00:46.270 --> 00:00:48.700
Some of the famous names
you might have heard of --

00:00:48.700 --> 00:00:52.330
well, there's Walt Whitman,
Leonard Bernstein, Aaron Copland.

00:00:52.330 --> 00:00:55.820
And then, of course, there are
the many people you may never

00:00:55.820 --> 00:01:00.010
of heard of, but will really enjoy
coming and looking at the material,

00:01:00.010 --> 00:01:02.810
and learning and hearing
their stories.

00:01:02.810 --> 00:01:04.460
&gt;&gt; Georgia Higley: This
is the Sunday Dispatch

00:01:04.460 --> 00:01:08.730
from March and April of 1852.

00:01:08.730 --> 00:01:12.030
And, the importance of it is
the fact that The Adventures

00:01:12.030 --> 00:01:16.310
of Jack Engle is a serialized
story that was actually written

00:01:16.310 --> 00:01:19.420
by Walt Whitman, even
though it wasn't attributed

00:01:19.420 --> 00:01:22.350
to him in this Sunday Dispatch.

00:01:22.350 --> 00:01:24.690
Published on the front page.

00:01:24.690 --> 00:01:28.890
The first three or four
columns of every front page.

00:01:28.890 --> 00:01:32.080
And, we are the only
ones in the country

00:01:32.080 --> 00:01:34.460
that has a complete
set of these issues.

00:01:34.460 --> 00:01:39.600
&gt;&gt; Mark Dimunation: And, I've got
in front of me some selections

00:01:39.600 --> 00:01:42.210
from our artist, book,
and fine press collection.

00:01:42.210 --> 00:01:45.700
These books represent
contributions by lesbians, gay men,

00:01:45.700 --> 00:01:49.030
transsexuals who use the
book arts form as a way

00:01:49.030 --> 00:01:51.780
of expressing their
experience or their struggles.

00:01:51.780 --> 00:01:55.140
We have everything from
Jean Cocteau in the 1930s,

00:01:55.140 --> 00:01:59.450
up to books that relate the
experience of HIV and the death

00:01:59.450 --> 00:02:02.670
from AIDS, to the 14
stations of the cross.

00:02:02.670 --> 00:02:06.130
We have a lesbian bicycle
rider who talks

00:02:06.130 --> 00:02:08.660
about her accident
with a pop-up book.

00:02:08.660 --> 00:02:13.400
And, we have a really fascinating
book about marriage equality,

00:02:13.400 --> 00:02:16.880
in which the artist asks
nontraditional families to go

00:02:16.880 --> 00:02:19.390
to Sears to have a
family portrait taken.

00:02:19.390 --> 00:02:23.090
And, then they talk about why
their family is just as ordinary

00:02:23.090 --> 00:02:25.060
as the others that go to Sears.

00:02:25.060 --> 00:02:29.200
And, finally, a re-creation of
love letters between two men

00:02:29.200 --> 00:02:31.800
in Far Rockaway at the
turn of the century.

00:02:31.800 --> 00:02:35.680
So, these are just a few of the
many, many examples of book arts

00:02:35.680 --> 00:02:39.190 position:56%
that come from the LGBTQ+ community.

00:02:39.190 --> 00:02:41.110
&gt;&gt; Nicholas A. Brown: I'm very
pleased to be sharing with you some

00:02:41.110 --> 00:02:43.430
of our performing arts
collections at the Library,

00:02:43.430 --> 00:02:46.490
which are representative
of the entire history

00:02:46.490 --> 00:02:49.820
of performing arts traditions in
Europe, in Asia, around the world,

00:02:49.820 --> 00:02:51.660
and here at home in the US.

00:02:51.660 --> 00:02:54.020 position:56%
Within our collections, we have
what are called special collections,

00:02:54.020 --> 00:02:56.930
which might be the papers of
a composer, or a lyricist,

00:02:56.930 --> 00:03:00.890
or a choreographer, such as
Alvin Ailey, whose papers we have

00:03:00.890 --> 00:03:02.300 position:56%
through his foundation's collection.

00:03:02.300 --> 00:03:04.420
We have Leonard Bernstein's papers.

00:03:04.420 --> 00:03:06.570
Jonathan Larson, who is
the composer and lyricist

00:03:06.570 --> 00:03:09.960
for the hit musical Rent, which is
celebrating its 20th anniversary

00:03:09.960 --> 00:03:11.270
of its national tour this year.

00:03:11.270 --> 00:03:16.150
These items showcase not only
the importance of LGBTQ creators

00:03:16.150 --> 00:03:18.480
in the US and around the
world, but also the stories

00:03:18.480 --> 00:03:21.930
of the LGBTQ community as
told by everyone in society.

00:03:21.930 --> 00:03:25.870
So, for example, Rent was one
of the first mainstream musicals

00:03:25.870 --> 00:03:29.140
to address the LGBTQ
and the HIV experiences

00:03:29.140 --> 00:03:31.590
in a very public and
significant manner.

00:03:31.590 --> 00:03:33.890
And, we're still learning from
that representation today.

00:03:33.890 --> 00:03:36.340
&gt;&gt; David Pelizzari:
Hi, I'm David Pelizzari

00:03:36.340 --> 00:03:38.360
from the National Library
Service for the Blind

00:03:38.360 --> 00:03:39.880
and Physically Handicapped.

00:03:39.880 --> 00:03:42.050
This is the section of
the Library of Congress

00:03:42.050 --> 00:03:44.910
that offers reading
materials in many formats

00:03:44.910 --> 00:03:49.450
for people facing visual problems
or other physical impairments

00:03:49.450 --> 00:03:51.420
that prevent them from
using books normally.

00:03:51.420 --> 00:03:57.080
So, for example, here is a talking
book player that is proprietary

00:03:57.080 --> 00:03:58.850
to the Library of Congress.

00:03:58.850 --> 00:04:00.390
Here is a flash drive.

00:04:00.390 --> 00:04:04.110
It looks a little bit like an
old cassette, but it's not.

00:04:04.110 --> 00:04:05.410
It's a flash drive.

00:04:05.410 --> 00:04:07.710
And, this contains a talking book.

00:04:07.710 --> 00:04:13.850
The book in question is Queer:
The Ultimate LGBT Guide for Teens.

00:04:13.850 --> 00:04:18.470
And, we have lots of materials
that serve the Pride community.

00:04:18.470 --> 00:04:19.980
And, we are proud of them.

00:04:19.980 --> 00:04:21.540
Let me show you one more thing,

00:04:21.540 --> 00:04:23.660
which is actually kind
of remarkable.

00:04:23.660 --> 00:04:27.810
This is a book that is
printed in dual format.

00:04:27.810 --> 00:04:30.980
You can see that it sort of looks
like a regular children's book.

00:04:30.980 --> 00:04:36.060
But, between the pages are
transparent brail sheets

00:04:36.060 --> 00:04:37.660
that are brailed on both sides.

00:04:37.660 --> 00:04:42.660
This way, a family or a group of
people -- some of whom use brail,

00:04:42.660 --> 00:04:46.500
some of whom use books normally
-- can share the book together

00:04:46.500 --> 00:04:47.800
and read the book together.

00:04:47.800 --> 00:04:53.440
This particular book, I am Jazz,
is sort of a mini autobiography

00:04:53.440 --> 00:04:57.730
of Jazz, a transgender kid
who's now a star on MTV.

00:04:57.730 --> 00:05:04.290
So, we produce about 25 of these
dual-format books every year.

00:05:04.290 --> 00:05:07.240
And, we've got it -- it so happens
that within this coming year,

00:05:07.240 --> 00:05:10.940
we're going to have another book
related to topics of interest

00:05:10.940 --> 00:05:12.240
to the transgender community.

00:05:12.240 --> 00:05:13.880
It's called Introducing Teddy.

00:05:13.880 --> 00:05:16.360
We're very proud of
a product like this.

00:05:16.360 --> 00:05:22.510
&gt;&gt; Lee Avdoyan: About 1990,
'91, I suggested to the Library

00:05:22.510 --> 00:05:26.250
of Congress Profession Association
that we do an AIDS quilt.

00:05:26.250 --> 00:05:28.720
Because by that time,
I knew of other names.

00:05:28.720 --> 00:05:31.470
And, they jumped at the chance.

00:05:31.470 --> 00:05:34.570
And, they said, would I
agree to co-chair it with one

00:05:34.570 --> 00:05:37.650
of their office holders,
the late [inaudible] Salem?

00:05:37.650 --> 00:05:39.550
And, that's how the
quilt came about.

00:05:39.550 --> 00:05:43.060
We put together a committee
of the most marvelous people.

00:05:43.060 --> 00:05:45.650
The most driven people
you will ever have known.

00:05:45.650 --> 00:05:49.690
The only guidance we gave to begin
with is that Phil and I decided

00:05:49.690 --> 00:05:53.360
that we would like
the dome on the quilt.

00:05:53.360 --> 00:05:54.660
And the names.

00:05:54.660 --> 00:05:58.310
And another principle
we established,

00:05:58.310 --> 00:06:02.260
that we would include no name
unless there was a written source

00:06:02.260 --> 00:06:05.520
that they had succumbed to
AIDS, or their family agreed.

00:06:05.520 --> 00:06:08.420
So, you will see many names
up there, "sine nominee" --

00:06:08.420 --> 00:06:11.790
without name, because we
could not meet that criteria.

00:06:11.790 --> 00:06:14.500
&gt;&gt; Kathy Woodrell: So, this quilt
was fabricated here at the Library

00:06:14.500 --> 00:06:17.560
in a variety of conference rooms.

00:06:17.560 --> 00:06:21.460
We brought in sewing machines,
ironing boards and irons.

00:06:21.460 --> 00:06:24.240
And, then we took different
parts of it home.

00:06:24.240 --> 00:06:25.540
If you look at it closely,

00:06:25.540 --> 00:06:29.970
you'll notice that the names are
actually constructed in strips,

00:06:29.970 --> 00:06:34.640
because a number of different
people wanted to sew down the name

00:06:34.640 --> 00:06:36.550
of a person that they
might have known.

00:06:36.550 --> 00:06:39.000
And, then we sewed all
the strips together.

00:06:39.000 --> 00:06:42.470
It was on the mall in 1993.

00:06:42.470 --> 00:06:45.570
We actually made it in 1992.

00:06:45.570 --> 00:06:49.430
&gt;&gt; Lee Avdoyan: It was supposed
to be displayed for one day

00:06:49.430 --> 00:06:52.240
when we unveiled it
outside in the Mumford Room.

00:06:52.240 --> 00:06:57.600
It was on a riser, outside -- in
the foyer of the Mumford Room.

00:06:57.600 --> 00:07:00.870
Dr. Billington came by
and was so moved by it,

00:07:00.870 --> 00:07:04.490
he directed that it be hung
on a wall and displayed

00:07:04.490 --> 00:07:07.340
for at least a month, so
that everyone could see it.

00:07:07.340 --> 00:07:11.510
&gt;&gt; Kathy Woodrell: It's an honor
to see it again, after 25 years.

00:07:11.510 --> 00:07:29.660
[ Music ]

00:07:29.660 --> 00:07:33.300
