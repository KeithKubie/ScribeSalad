1
00:00:00,990 --> 00:00:02,460
I was going to do a brand new topic,

2
00:00:02,461 --> 00:00:06,660
but I didn't want to go without making
sure everyone understands the loop,

3
00:00:06,661 --> 00:00:07,494
the loop problem,

4
00:00:09,120 --> 00:00:14,120
because that's one problem where if you
didn't learn Newton's laws and I played

5
00:00:14,121 --> 00:00:16,380
them properly, you just
couldn't figure it out. Okay.

6
00:00:17,010 --> 00:00:21,660
All the other things we do in know block,
sliding down planes, friction, police,

7
00:00:21,910 --> 00:00:24,870
you have an intuitive feeling for that.
But this one

8
00:00:26,670 --> 00:00:30,360
really is a very non intuitive,
right?

9
00:00:30,900 --> 00:00:35,850
Here's is a trolley at the top of
the track, the forces on the trolley.

10
00:00:36,960 --> 00:00:41,490
What gravity and the force of
the track or bought pushing down.

11
00:00:43,140 --> 00:00:47,100
And the question is why isn't it
falling down? Everything pushing down.

12
00:00:47,610 --> 00:00:49,770
Why isn't it falling down?
That's the mystery.

13
00:00:51,090 --> 00:00:55,530
So what's the answer you would give to
somebody says, why isn't the falling down?

14
00:00:55,620 --> 00:00:56,453
Yes,

15
00:00:56,530 --> 00:00:57,363
that's fine.

16
00:01:01,760 --> 00:01:05,140
Yes. So they might say, well, if
you say it's falling down, oh,

17
00:01:05,240 --> 00:01:09,080
how come it doesn't end up here
to the center of the circle?

18
00:01:14,040 --> 00:01:17,010
Yes. You had a night. Somebody
at an answer to that? Yes.

19
00:01:18,540 --> 00:01:19,373
Okay.

20
00:01:20,810 --> 00:01:21,643
Pardon me.

21
00:01:21,790 --> 00:01:22,680
Well,
it's just hard time.

22
00:01:27,750 --> 00:01:32,590
Uh, no. There are no forces
in the horizontal direction.
The forces are all yes.

23
00:01:32,890 --> 00:01:33,723
Yeah.

24
00:01:38,230 --> 00:01:40,520
Uh,
it's not negligible.

25
00:01:40,521 --> 00:01:43,630
Debt is an acceleration that's
producing a change in velocity.

26
00:01:44,170 --> 00:01:46,600
When we say an apple has
a downward acceleration,

27
00:01:47,140 --> 00:01:50,690
you let it go and it falls down. That's
what we think is downward acceleration.

28
00:01:51,100 --> 00:01:54,820
Here is something which a
downward acceleration, but
it's not falling down. Yes.

29
00:01:56,320 --> 00:02:00,700
Changes the direction of, of
feedback. Apple, over time,

30
00:02:00,770 --> 00:02:04,040
acceleration times,
time changes.

31
00:02:04,240 --> 00:02:07,630
It just changes the direction
of the velocity vector. Okay.

32
00:02:08,060 --> 00:02:10,070
Yeah. I like take one more answer. Yes.

33
00:02:11,080 --> 00:02:16,080
The downward component and a horizontal
component of the velocities are

34
00:02:16,770 --> 00:02:17,820
independent of each other.

35
00:02:18,180 --> 00:02:23,170
So the same time that the car can be
falling down in one direction to that.

36
00:02:24,430 --> 00:02:28,750
All right, so let me summarize all
the different answers. First of all,

37
00:02:29,320 --> 00:02:32,290
one thing you should remember,
no horizontal forces here.

38
00:02:32,440 --> 00:02:35,320
The forces are what I brought. That's
the way it should be. Very, very careful.

39
00:02:35,890 --> 00:02:37,270
Just because something has a tendency,

40
00:02:37,271 --> 00:02:39,520
the mode to the left doesn't
mean there's a force to the left.

41
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:44,110
That's the whole point of Newton's law
forces connected or acceleration not to

42
00:02:44,111 --> 00:02:48,130
velocity. So yes, this
will have an acceleration.

43
00:02:48,160 --> 00:02:49,990
You cannot avoid it.
F equals m.

44
00:02:49,991 --> 00:02:54,991
A we'll tell you t plus m g is m a
and a that you want in this problem.

45
00:02:57,011 --> 00:02:58,210
If it moving in a circle,

46
00:02:59,570 --> 00:03:02,500
M v squared over R so it is accelerating

47
00:03:04,100 --> 00:03:06,820
and the difference between
this one accelerating.

48
00:03:07,290 --> 00:03:11,170
Let us say I got the loop,
the loop and I drop an apple.

49
00:03:12,490 --> 00:03:15,430
Forget the track. It's got an mg
acting. The owner's accelerating too.

50
00:03:15,460 --> 00:03:19,540
What's the difference between these
two here you start with zero velocity,

51
00:03:20,380 --> 00:03:23,560
you accelerate downwards. That means
you pick up a downward velocity.

52
00:03:24,020 --> 00:03:27,700
I said this or the which is keep falling
down and picking up more and more speed.

53
00:03:29,110 --> 00:03:33,130
The same acceleration is experienced by
the cart also and a little more because

54
00:03:33,131 --> 00:03:34,270
tea is also pushing down,

55
00:03:34,810 --> 00:03:38,170
but they're the change in velocity
over a tiny amount of time.

56
00:03:38,200 --> 00:03:39,970
It's not added to zero velocity,

57
00:03:41,110 --> 00:03:46,110
but to this large velocity it has at
that instant and the tiny increment and

58
00:03:46,121 --> 00:03:50,650
velocity you've added this way will
produce a velocity in that direction and

59
00:03:50,651 --> 00:03:53,290
what that really means if you
wait a smaller amount of time,

60
00:03:53,620 --> 00:03:57,340
this thing is going along
the new velocity direction.

61
00:03:59,080 --> 00:04:00,490
So that's the difference between,

62
00:04:00,820 --> 00:04:04,750
so the acceleration is the same for
the falling apple as for the loop,

63
00:04:04,751 --> 00:04:09,730
the loop card, but in the apple case
it has added two zero initial velocity.

64
00:04:09,730 --> 00:04:13,630
So the acceleration and the
velocity or the same namely down,

65
00:04:14,530 --> 00:04:18,010
if you have a huge velocity to which
you at a tiny change in velocity in the

66
00:04:18,011 --> 00:04:20,860
downward direction,
you rotate the velocity vector.

67
00:04:21,100 --> 00:04:23,320
That just means that as
it goes around the circle,

68
00:04:23,590 --> 00:04:26,200
the velocity vector is
constantly tangent to the circle.

69
00:04:27,670 --> 00:04:29,800
That's another way in which
people understand this.

70
00:04:30,220 --> 00:04:35,220
If around the earth and you a standing
say on a building and you fire the gun,

71
00:04:37,660 --> 00:04:41,950
it goes like that and it hits the
ground because of an acceleration due to

72
00:04:41,951 --> 00:04:45,760
gravity. If you find it a
little faster, it'll go there.

73
00:04:46,030 --> 00:04:49,600
They'll be certain speed at
which it keeps falling for.

74
00:04:49,601 --> 00:04:51,220
It doesn't get any closer to the center.

75
00:04:52,840 --> 00:04:55,720
That is in fact how you
launch a bullet into orbit.

76
00:04:57,190 --> 00:04:59,560
So what's the first thing you
should do when you fired this gun?

77
00:05:03,720 --> 00:05:07,900
More away because it's going to come
back and get you from behind. Okay.

78
00:05:08,560 --> 00:05:10,720
All right. That's a very useful
lesson. So you might think, hey,

79
00:05:10,721 --> 00:05:14,620
I sharted in that direction. It's
not my problem. Like everything else,

80
00:05:14,650 --> 00:05:19,600
it'll come back and get you when you
least expect it, but this is how you have,

81
00:05:20,200 --> 00:05:23,560
so it's this thing falling or not.
It is constantly falling,

82
00:05:24,220 --> 00:05:28,360
but the earth is falling under that. So
it's endless search to come to the earth.

83
00:05:28,840 --> 00:05:32,380
Whereas if you dropped the bullet and
he'd just fall and hit the ground,

84
00:05:32,410 --> 00:05:36,280
that's what we always think us draw.
Okay.

85
00:05:36,310 --> 00:05:40,360
So this is something I did in a rush
and I didn't want that because this is

86
00:05:40,361 --> 00:05:44,860
really the part of physics which is not
intuitive and I think we all know what

87
00:05:44,861 --> 00:05:45,790
the main part is.

88
00:05:45,791 --> 00:05:50,410
The main point is velocity is a
vector and its value can change.

89
00:05:50,440 --> 00:05:53,530
You're the change in direction.
Natya Indian magnitude. Yes sir.

90
00:05:56,930 --> 00:06:01,160
Or changing velocity, right?
What does that equal to? Okay.

91
00:06:01,550 --> 00:06:02,930
If you wait a certain time,

92
00:06:02,931 --> 00:06:07,931
Delta t then the acceleration
is v squared over r put the,

93
00:06:08,781 --> 00:06:12,800
we put the art, get some number, multiply
by that Delta t one 10th of a second.

94
00:06:13,190 --> 00:06:15,170
That would be the change in that time.

95
00:06:16,550 --> 00:06:20,390
So in that time also the guy would've
moved over and the circle a little bit

96
00:06:20,690 --> 00:06:25,140
just precisely so that at that point you
knew velocity vector is tangent to the

97
00:06:25,160 --> 00:06:29,330
new location.
So this little Delta v I drew,

98
00:06:29,360 --> 00:06:31,760
it's not a fixed number.
It depends on how long I want to wait.

99
00:06:32,670 --> 00:06:35,270
Calculuses wait infinitesimal
amount of time and practice.

100
00:06:35,271 --> 00:06:39,740
Wait one femtosecond and it'll
be fine. Okay. Today is very,

101
00:06:39,741 --> 00:06:42,200
very important concept I want introduce.

102
00:06:42,970 --> 00:06:46,310
It's a very robust and powerful concept.
It has to do with energy.

103
00:06:50,610 --> 00:06:55,040
It is powerful because after the loss
of quantum mechanics were discovered in

104
00:06:55,041 --> 00:07:00,030
the subatomic world, we basically gave
up on many cherished notions. You know,

105
00:07:00,080 --> 00:07:03,110
you must have heard that particles
can not have a definite position and

106
00:07:03,111 --> 00:07:07,190
definitely velocity at a given time.
They don't have any trajectories.

107
00:07:07,490 --> 00:07:10,460
You see a particular here now,
then you see it there.

108
00:07:10,970 --> 00:07:14,660
That's true because they are observed
events. What happens in between,

109
00:07:15,080 --> 00:07:16,370
you might think they have a trajectory,

110
00:07:16,400 --> 00:07:20,810
but they don't force us are
not well defined because
if you don't know where the

111
00:07:20,811 --> 00:07:24,220
guy is, you don't know what [inaudible]
is. You don't know about the acceleration.

112
00:07:24,240 --> 00:07:27,800
So most of the ideas of Newtonian
mechanics are basically surrendered.

113
00:07:28,550 --> 00:07:33,550
But the notion of energy turns out to
be very robust and survives all the

114
00:07:33,591 --> 00:07:36,620
quantum revolution.
In fact,

115
00:07:36,621 --> 00:07:41,330
there was a period when
people are studying nuclear
reactions and the energy you

116
00:07:41,331 --> 00:07:43,760
began with them seem to be
the energy you ended up with.

117
00:07:45,130 --> 00:07:48,200
So something was missing.
So Niels Bohr,

118
00:07:48,201 --> 00:07:52,280
father of the atom said maybe the law
of conservation of energy is not valid.

119
00:07:53,390 --> 00:07:57,470
Then Polly said, I think I put my money
on the law of conservation of energy.

120
00:07:57,920 --> 00:08:02,210
I would postulate that that is some other
tiny particle that you guys cannot see

121
00:08:02,480 --> 00:08:07,130
that's carrying away all
the missing energy. That is
a very radical thing to do.

122
00:08:07,131 --> 00:08:11,510
In those days when people did not lightly
postulate new particles. Nowadays,

123
00:08:11,511 --> 00:08:12,790
if you don't postulate a particle,

124
00:08:12,800 --> 00:08:17,800
you don't get your Phd in particle
physics those days it was very radical and

125
00:08:18,411 --> 00:08:21,440
the particular is not seen for many,
many years. It is called the Neutrino.

126
00:08:21,830 --> 00:08:24,350
Nowadays, neutrinos are one
of the most exciting things.

127
00:08:24,360 --> 00:08:28,400
One could study a lot of ministries.
The universe connected with neutrinos.

128
00:08:29,630 --> 00:08:32,800
Okay, so energy is a concept you're
going to learn. Here is again,

129
00:08:32,870 --> 00:08:37,870
place where it asks you don't memorize
the formulas and start plugging them in.

130
00:08:38,660 --> 00:08:42,760
Try to follow the logic by which you are
driven to this notion because then it

131
00:08:42,761 --> 00:08:46,700
will be less luggage for you to carry
in your head and I'll try to make the

132
00:08:46,701 --> 00:08:49,370
notion as natural as
possible rather than saying,

133
00:08:49,760 --> 00:08:52,550
this is my definition of energy.
This is the definition of kinetic energy.

134
00:08:52,850 --> 00:08:54,470
Let's ask,
where does all that come from?

135
00:08:55,470 --> 00:09:00,270
How many people have seen Kennedy
can potential energies in your past?

136
00:09:01,890 --> 00:09:03,780
Okay. If you haven't seen it, that's fine.

137
00:09:03,781 --> 00:09:05,640
This is not something
you're supposed to know.

138
00:09:05,910 --> 00:09:08,550
If you know it and you learned
it properly, it will be helpful.

139
00:09:08,790 --> 00:09:12,030
But you don't have to know that. We just
have to know what we have done so far.

140
00:09:12,810 --> 00:09:17,160
So let's go back and ask simple question.
When a force acts on a body,

141
00:09:20,070 --> 00:09:22,500
what is its main effect?
What does it do?

142
00:09:24,930 --> 00:09:25,763
Yes.

143
00:09:27,300 --> 00:09:30,070
Uh, be more precise by when
you say changes its motion,

144
00:09:32,680 --> 00:09:34,390
what does it mean to change its motion?

145
00:09:36,170 --> 00:09:38,940
Yes.
All right.

146
00:09:39,180 --> 00:09:41,730
That's from Newton's law.
That means it changes the velocity.

147
00:09:42,420 --> 00:09:45,960
So let's for the mill for a moment,
in fact, for the entire lecture today,

148
00:09:46,470 --> 00:09:47,760
go back to one dimension.

149
00:09:48,330 --> 00:09:51,630
Then we will do the whole business
and higher dimensions. One dimension.

150
00:09:51,990 --> 00:09:54,090
Judging the velocity
simply means speeding up.

151
00:09:54,830 --> 00:09:57,900
So bodies are going to speed up and
forces act on them. That we know.

152
00:09:58,590 --> 00:10:03,240
We're going to find the relation
between how much speed is accumulated.

153
00:10:03,270 --> 00:10:05,850
When a force acts on a body
are going to deny that.

154
00:10:07,200 --> 00:10:11,550
So let us take an example where
they force is an x, that action.

155
00:10:11,880 --> 00:10:16,740
And there's some constant constant
meaning. It's not varying with time.

156
00:10:17,520 --> 00:10:20,700
Somebody decides to just applied
10 newtons constantly to a body.

157
00:10:22,890 --> 00:10:27,890
What does that do? That produces an
acceleration, which is f over an APP,

158
00:10:29,040 --> 00:10:30,360
right?
That's Newton's law.

159
00:10:33,140 --> 00:10:37,250
That's a constant acceleration,
so let's go back to lecture number one.

160
00:10:37,940 --> 00:10:38,960
Lecture Number One,

161
00:10:39,290 --> 00:10:44,290
we learn that if a body has constant
acceleration than the velocity at the end

162
00:10:45,410 --> 00:10:50,410
is the velocity squared in the beginning
plus two times a times the distance

163
00:10:52,131 --> 00:10:56,210
traveled.
This part we learned long back.

164
00:10:56,750 --> 00:10:58,040
This is just kinematics.

165
00:10:58,730 --> 00:11:01,970
In those days we didn't ask why is
it having a constant acceleration?

166
00:11:01,971 --> 00:11:05,270
You were just told that's a constant
acceleration. Just go ahead.

167
00:11:05,690 --> 00:11:09,170
Now that we learned dynamics,
we know acceleration as a cost,

168
00:11:09,200 --> 00:11:10,460
namely a certain force,

169
00:11:10,520 --> 00:11:15,380
so I'm going to right here as you can
imagine for with them in the place of a,

170
00:11:16,070 --> 00:11:20,900
but I'm going to make one more cosmetic
change and notation in all these energy

171
00:11:20,901 --> 00:11:21,734
formulas.

172
00:11:22,160 --> 00:11:26,720
Rather than calling the initial velocity
or initial anything with a subscript

173
00:11:26,721 --> 00:11:28,820
zero and the finalists,

174
00:11:29,180 --> 00:11:33,230
no subscript we're going to use in
rotation with the final quantities are

175
00:11:33,250 --> 00:11:37,520
denoted with a subscript two initial
quantities had been noted by a subscript

176
00:11:37,521 --> 00:11:39,590
one.
In other words,

177
00:11:39,680 --> 00:11:44,680
initially the body had a Velocity v one
and then you'd had an acceleration a

178
00:11:45,580 --> 00:11:49,130
farther the distance d than the relation
between final initial velocities is

179
00:11:49,131 --> 00:11:53,000
this, so let's put that f over
em here and let you put a,

180
00:11:57,200 --> 00:11:59,930
since we are interested in
the effect or the force,

181
00:12:00,320 --> 00:12:02,480
we want to see what the
force due to the velocity.

182
00:12:04,280 --> 00:12:07,580
What you find here is that if you
want to find the tangent of velocity,

183
00:12:07,610 --> 00:12:10,400
of course you should take this
guy to the left hand side, right?

184
00:12:10,910 --> 00:12:14,570
Take her to the other side and you want
to isolate the force of bring em over

185
00:12:14,571 --> 00:12:15,650
two to the left hand side,

186
00:12:16,250 --> 00:12:21,250
so do that in your head and what you get
ammo word to be two square minus m over

187
00:12:22,911 --> 00:12:26,960
to the one square is f Times D.

188
00:12:31,080 --> 00:12:34,710
Yeah. This is a very important concept.
It says when the force acts on the body,

189
00:12:35,100 --> 00:12:39,510
it changes the velocity and it depends
on how far the force has been acting,

190
00:12:39,630 --> 00:12:41,520
how many meters you've
been pushing the object.

191
00:12:41,730 --> 00:12:45,510
It's clear that if you had done push it
at all than even though forces acting

192
00:12:45,540 --> 00:12:47,310
velocity hasn't had time to change,

193
00:12:47,670 --> 00:12:52,380
so it seems to depend on how far the
forest acted and the change is not simply

194
00:12:52,381 --> 00:12:57,300
in velocity, but in velocity
square. That's what comes out.

195
00:12:57,780 --> 00:13:02,430
Then you realize that it's the most
natural thing in the world to give this

196
00:13:02,431 --> 00:13:05,190
combination a name because
that's what comes out of this.

197
00:13:05,730 --> 00:13:10,120
That combination is called the Kennedy
Energy and I'm going to call it kid.

198
00:13:10,121 --> 00:13:15,121
Too many care at the end minus
k at the beginning is f Times d

199
00:13:18,330 --> 00:13:19,390
f times.
The

200
00:13:20,420 --> 00:13:21,253
yes

201
00:13:22,220 --> 00:13:26,150
is denoted by the symbol w
and that's called a work done.

202
00:13:29,020 --> 00:13:29,853
Why f?

203
00:13:32,030 --> 00:13:35,570
That's how he introduced the notion of
a force times distance of the definition

204
00:13:35,571 --> 00:13:38,660
of work. This is how people, you can say,

205
00:13:38,661 --> 00:13:42,260
why did anyone think of taking
the combination f Times d will.

206
00:13:42,261 --> 00:13:47,060
This is how it happens,
so you need to have a unit for this,

207
00:13:47,180 --> 00:13:48,860
which is actually a Newton meters,

208
00:13:49,280 --> 00:13:52,430
but we are tired of calling everything
in Newton meter so we are going to call

209
00:13:52,431 --> 00:13:53,264
it a jewel.

210
00:13:54,020 --> 00:13:59,020
Jewel or Jay is just a
shorthand for Newton meters.

211
00:14:07,090 --> 00:14:07,970
All right,
so

212
00:14:10,520 --> 00:14:14,240
let us know right down the
say following expression here.

213
00:14:17,210 --> 00:14:20,690
Delta K Delta K in

214
00:14:22,430 --> 00:14:26,690
anything we do is a change in any
quantity is called Delta of that quantity.

215
00:14:26,750 --> 00:14:31,430
Delta K is a change in k is SQL.
Do the F, time to distance travel.

216
00:14:31,700 --> 00:14:34,580
Let the distance travel be
some tiny amount. Delta x,

217
00:14:35,930 --> 00:14:40,040
this formula is valid even if the is one
kilometer as long as forces constant,

218
00:14:40,060 --> 00:14:45,060
but I'm saying let's focus on a problem
whether the forces constant or not or

219
00:14:45,271 --> 00:14:48,890
what a tiny interval in which the
body moves to distance delta x.

220
00:14:50,030 --> 00:14:54,080
Then we find that the change, the
candidate energy is force times delta x.

221
00:14:55,550 --> 00:14:59,210
What if there are 36 forces acting
on the body? Which one should I use?

222
00:15:00,440 --> 00:15:02,030
I'm pulling and you're pushing and

223
00:15:04,190 --> 00:15:08,210
it's gotta be the net force because
Newton's law connects the net force to the

224
00:15:08,211 --> 00:15:09,044
acceleration.

225
00:15:09,590 --> 00:15:13,670
If you and I have a tag of war and
we cancel each other out to zero,

226
00:15:13,671 --> 00:15:17,960
then there is no acceleration,
so you got to go back to the definition.

227
00:15:17,960 --> 00:15:20,990
This is very, very important.
This F better be the total force.

228
00:15:21,500 --> 00:15:23,480
I should really use the
subscript t four total,

229
00:15:23,481 --> 00:15:26,680
but I don't want to do that when we
write ethicals. I miss understood.

230
00:15:26,720 --> 00:15:31,710
F is everything. We will come back
later to the notion of what happens if,

231
00:15:31,800 --> 00:15:35,870
if efforts made up of two parts. So maybe
I'll just give you a simple example.

232
00:15:36,920 --> 00:15:41,330
Here's a body, right, and I'm pushing it
this way and you're pushing it that way.

233
00:15:41,360 --> 00:15:42,620
Let's say with equal force

234
00:15:44,360 --> 00:15:48,020
and the body could be addressed or
if the body had an initial velocity,

235
00:15:48,021 --> 00:15:51,320
it'll maintain the initial velocity
because velocity is for free.

236
00:15:52,370 --> 00:15:55,270
Then you can ask,
what does this theater say?

237
00:15:55,360 --> 00:15:58,340
This is called a work energy theater work.

238
00:15:58,341 --> 00:16:02,450
Energy Theorem says the tangent energy
is equal to the work done by all the

239
00:16:02,451 --> 00:16:03,284
forces.

240
00:16:05,510 --> 00:16:10,510
In this case there is no change in energy
but there are two forces at work that

241
00:16:10,671 --> 00:16:11,504
cancel.

242
00:16:12,290 --> 00:16:16,550
Then it turns out that it's sensible
to define the work done by me

243
00:16:18,290 --> 00:16:23,290
with this equals f times the distance of
travel and the work done by you will be

244
00:16:23,931 --> 00:16:25,910
in fact given a minus sign.

245
00:16:27,770 --> 00:16:30,650
So when do we attach a plus sign
and when do we attach a minus sign?

246
00:16:30,920 --> 00:16:33,770
If you go back to the
whole innovation it was at,

247
00:16:33,800 --> 00:16:38,210
it was understood that a was a positive
quantity, then everything works.

248
00:16:38,510 --> 00:16:41,840
But if the body is moving to the
right and I'm pushing to the right,

249
00:16:42,380 --> 00:16:46,700
then the work done by me is positive and
if you are pushing to the left and the

250
00:16:46,701 --> 00:16:50,270
body is still moved to the right to work
done by you as negative. In other words,

251
00:16:50,271 --> 00:16:52,680
if you get your way,
namely things move.

252
00:16:52,680 --> 00:16:55,160
The way you're pushing the
work done by you is positive.

253
00:16:55,940 --> 00:16:59,210
If people are pushing your counter to
your wheel in the opposite direction to

254
00:16:59,211 --> 00:17:03,350
your force worked, then by you is
negative. So here's a simple example.

255
00:17:03,351 --> 00:17:08,090
I have a piece of chalk and I'm lifting
it at constant velocity from the ground

256
00:17:09,620 --> 00:17:13,970
is kinetic. Energy is not changing. That
means the total work done on it, the zero,

257
00:17:14,480 --> 00:17:18,440
but it's not because there are no forces
on it. That is gravity acting down.

258
00:17:18,680 --> 00:17:22,610
That is me countering gravity
with exactly the right amount.

259
00:17:23,270 --> 00:17:24,710
I'm applying a force AMG.

260
00:17:25,640 --> 00:17:29,840
So work then by me it would be positive
because I wanted to go up and it goes up.

261
00:17:30,200 --> 00:17:35,200
So if it goes up by an Ahmad age work
done by me is mg times age worked on by

262
00:17:35,331 --> 00:17:38,680
gravity in the meantime
is minus empty time set.

263
00:17:39,300 --> 00:17:43,160
So the total work done is zero.
So this formula

264
00:17:44,660 --> 00:17:46,220
says this is the total force,

265
00:17:46,221 --> 00:17:51,221
but I'm telling you if you take the work
done and call it Delta w it may be a

266
00:17:52,681 --> 00:17:55,500
result of many works work done by me,

267
00:17:55,501 --> 00:17:58,080
worked on baby you worked on by
somebody else. Some are positive,

268
00:17:58,081 --> 00:17:59,400
some are negative.
You add them all up.

269
00:18:00,540 --> 00:18:05,540
So that is the notion of work done by
one of many forces acting on the body and

270
00:18:05,671 --> 00:18:10,671
the total work done is the Algebraic sum
of the work done by all the forces are.

271
00:18:11,161 --> 00:18:13,590
So we got this resolved.
Let's do the following.

272
00:18:14,370 --> 00:18:19,370
Let us imagine all this occurs in a time
Delta t then Delta k over Delta t which

273
00:18:22,981 --> 00:18:27,981
will eventually become DKD t if you take
all the proper limits becomes f times

274
00:18:30,091 --> 00:18:33,390
Dxdt,
which is force times velocity.

275
00:18:34,210 --> 00:18:35,250
That's called power.

276
00:18:37,910 --> 00:18:42,420
So power is the rate at which
work is done. For example,

277
00:18:42,720 --> 00:18:44,820
if I climate 12 story building,

278
00:18:45,840 --> 00:18:49,680
I've done some work my m times g
times the height of the building,

279
00:18:50,430 --> 00:18:52,020
I can claim the building in one minute,

280
00:18:52,021 --> 00:18:54,690
I can climb the building in one
hour to work. Done is the same,

281
00:18:55,170 --> 00:18:57,660
but the power is a measure
of how rapidly work is done.

282
00:18:58,380 --> 00:19:00,840
That's why it's the product
of force and velocity.

283
00:19:01,290 --> 00:19:05,640
So the units for power or jewels per
second. Now that also has a new name,

284
00:19:06,120 --> 00:19:10,380
which is watts or this w
you may use a kilowatt,

285
00:19:11,070 --> 00:19:13,980
which is kw,
little kid mw thousand watts.

286
00:19:15,330 --> 00:19:16,890
So if you've got a 60 watt bulb,

287
00:19:17,970 --> 00:19:20,970
it's consuming energy or the
rate of 60 joules per second.

288
00:19:21,630 --> 00:19:25,590
That's the meaning of a 60 watt boat.
Okay.

289
00:19:25,620 --> 00:19:30,360
Now I'm going to do the next
generalization, which is when the force

290
00:19:32,100 --> 00:19:36,270
is not a constant but varies with x.

291
00:19:39,960 --> 00:19:44,370
So do we know any example of a
force that varies with location?

292
00:19:45,990 --> 00:19:50,310
Spring is one example. Even gravity,
I think we know it's not a secret.

293
00:19:50,790 --> 00:19:54,480
The force of is mg near the earth.
But if you go sufficiently far,

294
00:19:54,481 --> 00:19:58,730
you will noticed gravity itself is
getting weaker. It'll still look like AMG,

295
00:19:58,740 --> 00:20:03,740
but g won't be 9.8 g able to become
9.6 and 9.2 and 9.1 or decrease.

296
00:20:04,650 --> 00:20:08,850
But the variation of gravity in
terrestrial experiments is pretty small.

297
00:20:08,851 --> 00:20:10,020
So we won what he bought it.

298
00:20:10,650 --> 00:20:14,820
But the force of a spring definitely
varies with x and in order to civil away

299
00:20:15,030 --> 00:20:16,020
and the force of the spring.

300
00:20:16,021 --> 00:20:21,021
So one concrete example is what you
all seem to recognize is this one.

301
00:20:22,830 --> 00:20:27,420
So then we have to ask what is the work
energy theory theorem when the forces

302
00:20:27,421 --> 00:20:31,350
itself very,
so let's draw ourselves a force,

303
00:20:31,351 --> 00:20:35,970
which is very [inaudible] is my force.

304
00:20:36,040 --> 00:20:41,040
It does something f equals Kx
or minusK is a particular graph.

305
00:20:41,611 --> 00:20:44,730
I'm just taking any
function of f that I want.

306
00:20:46,740 --> 00:20:50,560
Now the acceleration is not constant
because the forest is not a constant.

307
00:20:51,160 --> 00:20:52,300
So if you wait for one hour,

308
00:20:52,330 --> 00:20:56,590
the change in Canada energy is not
simply force times distance because what

309
00:20:56,591 --> 00:20:57,730
force are you going to use?

310
00:20:57,970 --> 00:21:01,390
It was something now with something
later as positive, I was negative later.

311
00:21:01,780 --> 00:21:06,780
So we cannot apply this formula
because F it's not a constant.

312
00:21:08,260 --> 00:21:13,260
So the usual trick and calculuses
find me an interval in x.

313
00:21:14,730 --> 00:21:18,280
We just saw an arrow and I'll
make it as narrow as you insist

314
00:21:19,810 --> 00:21:24,810
so that during that period I think that
f is a constant and a constant value of

315
00:21:24,821 --> 00:21:29,821
f is just the function f at that Timex
at that time where the location is x.

316
00:21:32,980 --> 00:21:34,660
So for that tiny interval,

317
00:21:35,140 --> 00:21:38,050
I can still say that fs constant or what?

318
00:21:38,051 --> 00:21:41,560
Emma's some constant over the tiny
interval. Then the change in Kennedy,

319
00:21:41,561 --> 00:21:46,561
Kennedy will be then F of x Times Delta X.

320
00:21:48,450 --> 00:21:51,970
Yeah. Then you wait a little
longer, you go to a new place,

321
00:21:52,220 --> 00:21:54,580
then you got a new value of the force.
Maybe somewhere here.

322
00:21:55,060 --> 00:21:57,580
Then that times they'll tax is
the work done in that region,

323
00:21:58,780 --> 00:22:00,610
but geometrically FX them.

324
00:22:00,611 --> 00:22:05,611
Delta x is the area of the little
rectangle who's basest delta x and it was

325
00:22:06,611 --> 00:22:08,170
hyped as the function effort at time.

326
00:22:09,490 --> 00:22:13,610
So if you eventually went from here
to here, let me call that point.

327
00:22:13,611 --> 00:22:18,610
The next one and let me call the ending
point is x two then the work done by you.

328
00:22:19,150 --> 00:22:21,730
It's really given by
the area under the graph

329
00:22:24,080 --> 00:22:27,550
and in every segment you pick up
the chain than Kennedy energy you.

330
00:22:27,551 --> 00:22:32,090
You add it all up. Then we say
added all up on the left hand side.

331
00:22:32,180 --> 00:22:36,440
All the case will add up to give me the
final minus initial candidate energy.

332
00:22:37,130 --> 00:22:41,480
This one is what is written in
the notation of Calculus as Fx.

333
00:22:41,480 --> 00:22:44,030
DX from x one two x two

334
00:22:45,680 --> 00:22:48,770
this is called the integral
of the function ffx

335
00:22:50,320 --> 00:22:53,030
oh again,
in a course at this level,

336
00:22:53,420 --> 00:22:55,970
I'm assuming that you guys
know what an integral is.

337
00:22:56,810 --> 00:22:58,400
Even if you've never heard of an integral,

338
00:22:58,820 --> 00:23:02,090
if I give you a function and
you'd never heard of calculus,

339
00:23:02,360 --> 00:23:05,560
you can still deal with this problem
because you will come to me and say,

340
00:23:05,561 --> 00:23:06,530
give me your function.

341
00:23:07,040 --> 00:23:12,040
I'm going to plot it in a some kind of
graph paper with a grid on it and I'm

342
00:23:12,741 --> 00:23:16,220
just going to count the number of
pioneers squares and closed here.

343
00:23:16,610 --> 00:23:20,450
That's the area and that's the chain that
Kennedy energy integration is finding

344
00:23:20,451 --> 00:23:25,451
the area under graphs bounded by the
function of the top x axis below and two

345
00:23:25,641 --> 00:23:27,890
vertical lines at the
starting and ending points.

346
00:23:31,470 --> 00:23:35,160
Now a little digression,
even though you're supposed to know this,

347
00:23:35,490 --> 00:23:40,490
I want to make sure part of the no child
left behind program that you all follow

348
00:23:41,371 --> 00:23:42,010
this,

349
00:23:42,010 --> 00:23:46,880
so if you never heard calculus or integral
calculus is going to be a two minute,

350
00:23:46,881 --> 00:23:50,990
three minute introduction.
That is a great secret,

351
00:23:51,200 --> 00:23:55,190
which is that if you give me a function
and you told me to find the area under

352
00:23:55,191 --> 00:23:59,680
this from x one two x two I can go
to the graph paper and draw that are,

353
00:23:59,690 --> 00:24:04,160
that is quite often a trick.
You don't have to draw anything,

354
00:24:05,510 --> 00:24:06,343
you know,

355
00:24:06,370 --> 00:24:10,430
and I will tell you a little more about
what it is if you give me a function ffx

356
00:24:11,510 --> 00:24:15,710
the area under the graph happens to be
the following day to see another function.

357
00:24:15,711 --> 00:24:20,711
Gfx can be specified in a moment and you
just have to find g of the upper limit.

358
00:24:23,950 --> 00:24:28,430
Wayne at g are the lower limit
and that will be the area.

359
00:24:30,290 --> 00:24:31,970
And who is this mystery function?

360
00:24:31,971 --> 00:24:36,971
G Eight is any function who did
of it too is the given function.

361
00:24:37,620 --> 00:24:38,453
F

362
00:24:39,920 --> 00:24:40,753
okay.

363
00:24:42,380 --> 00:24:47,380
So the whole business of finding area
with a solid around Newton's time is if

364
00:24:48,831 --> 00:24:50,430
you have a function they want the 80 on,
did it.

365
00:24:50,450 --> 00:24:53,480
You go and think of a function who is
dead of active is the given function.

366
00:24:53,481 --> 00:24:55,400
So this is the opposite
of taking derivatives.

367
00:24:56,060 --> 00:24:59,180
Differentiation is an algorithmic process.
You take ffx,

368
00:24:59,181 --> 00:25:00,560
you add a delta x two the x,

369
00:25:00,570 --> 00:25:03,860
you find the change in after wide
without tax given any function,

370
00:25:03,861 --> 00:25:05,360
you can do that.
This is the opposite.

371
00:25:05,660 --> 00:25:08,930
This is guessing the function g
who is delivered to the staff,

372
00:25:10,550 --> 00:25:15,380
so if I say F of x
equals x cubed,

373
00:25:16,010 --> 00:25:19,490
the Gfx is that function
was deliberative is x cubed.

374
00:25:19,760 --> 00:25:23,960
So I know I got to start with x to the
fourth because of when I take derivatives

375
00:25:23,961 --> 00:25:26,390
it'll become an x cube but
with the foreign in it.

376
00:25:26,660 --> 00:25:31,400
So I fight that by putting a four
downstairs and that's the function g yes.

377
00:25:32,770 --> 00:25:33,603
Okay.

378
00:25:34,730 --> 00:25:35,240
Yes,

379
00:25:35,240 --> 00:25:40,030
that is the plus c Betsy is
of course velocity of light.

380
00:25:42,420 --> 00:25:44,330
Now why is this plus see there?

381
00:25:44,340 --> 00:25:47,900
He's quite right because if you've got
a function with database or something,

382
00:25:48,350 --> 00:25:51,770
adding a constant doesn't change the
date of it too. Then you can say,

383
00:25:51,830 --> 00:25:55,640
well we are in trouble now because you
told me to find a function g and you're

384
00:25:55,641 --> 00:25:59,480
telling me the world cannot agree on
what g is because I've got one g you got

385
00:25:59,481 --> 00:26:01,490
another one with different constants.

386
00:26:01,940 --> 00:26:06,500
But the beauty is that when you take
this difference, I'm in awkward.

387
00:26:06,560 --> 00:26:07,320
The constant didn't.

388
00:26:07,320 --> 00:26:12,320
You may put the constant but he's going
to cancel out so most of the time people

389
00:26:12,951 --> 00:26:14,060
don't bother with the cons.

390
00:26:14,780 --> 00:26:17,720
Sometimes it's very important to keep
the constantly plays a special role,

391
00:26:18,020 --> 00:26:20,870
but we don't want that here.
We'll just call this the integral

392
00:26:25,080 --> 00:26:30,030
so maybe it's again worth asking
for a second. Why is this true?

393
00:26:30,090 --> 00:26:31,590
You know,
why is g the function?

394
00:26:32,610 --> 00:26:35,250
Who's data Vudu is f why is
that the answer to the problem?

395
00:26:35,600 --> 00:26:36,840
We had one way to think about it,

396
00:26:37,230 --> 00:26:39,980
is it really more for your
completeness than anything else?

397
00:26:40,350 --> 00:26:44,190
Suppose that is a function
f and I'm finding the area,

398
00:26:44,730 --> 00:26:48,930
let me find it up to the point that I'm
going to call x two for the starting

399
00:26:48,931 --> 00:26:50,220
point.
Let me just pick zero.

400
00:26:53,610 --> 00:26:58,610
This is the ADM looking for and I rated
as FFX DX from zero to the point x two

401
00:27:03,630 --> 00:27:08,630
you agreed that I say slight x do back
and forth the areas bedding with x two so

402
00:27:08,821 --> 00:27:12,390
it's legitimate to call
that a function off x two

403
00:27:13,320 --> 00:27:14,153
okay.

404
00:27:15,730 --> 00:27:17,530
Function is anything that
depends on something else.

405
00:27:17,531 --> 00:27:21,040
And we all agree that if the
point x to moves the area moves,

406
00:27:21,250 --> 00:27:24,910
this is my shorthand for the area.
The starting point is nailed at zero.

407
00:27:24,940 --> 00:27:29,940
This is GFX do the Lex ask
what is g of x two plus Delta?

408
00:27:33,820 --> 00:27:38,820
That is the area till this point that
we in as FFX DX from zero to x two plus

409
00:27:42,491 --> 00:27:45,730
Delta,
that g of x two plus Delta.

410
00:27:46,660 --> 00:27:51,660
So what is the difference between the
two difference between the two is Gfx two

411
00:27:53,170 --> 00:27:56,510
plus Delta minus g of x two.

412
00:27:57,430 --> 00:28:02,050
If we look at the graph,
the extra area that I have is this thing

413
00:28:03,550 --> 00:28:08,550
and that is clearly equal to f
at the point x to with Delta x.

414
00:28:12,680 --> 00:28:15,850
Other words by how much is the area
changing? When I changed the upper limit,

415
00:28:16,390 --> 00:28:19,530
well the changing by the height of the
function of the very last moment times

416
00:28:19,540 --> 00:28:20,373
the change in x.

417
00:28:20,830 --> 00:28:24,700
Well we know what to do and are divided
by Delta x and take the limit and you

418
00:28:24,701 --> 00:28:27,010
can see that f of x two

419
00:28:29,050 --> 00:28:29,930
is DG

420
00:28:32,330 --> 00:28:37,270
the x at the point x too. But the
point x two is whatever point you want.

421
00:28:37,330 --> 00:28:41,980
So we dropped the label and we just
say thatF as a function of Xs d GDX.

422
00:28:42,220 --> 00:28:45,490
This is the origin of the result
that the area can be found.

423
00:28:45,491 --> 00:28:47,830
If you can find the inverse
that of the function.

424
00:28:49,620 --> 00:28:50,410
Yeah,

425
00:28:50,410 --> 00:28:53,320
so let's keep a couple of
popular examples in mind.

426
00:28:53,950 --> 00:28:57,490
One is f of x equals the constant.

427
00:28:58,300 --> 00:29:01,510
Then GFX is he going to constant times x,

428
00:29:02,300 --> 00:29:04,600
f of x equals x.

429
00:29:05,140 --> 00:29:08,350
Then GFX is equal to x squared over two

430
00:29:09,910 --> 00:29:10,361
as you know,

431
00:29:10,361 --> 00:29:14,380
the integral of extra the Nsx to the
n plus one over n plus one that are

432
00:29:14,381 --> 00:29:17,980
integral for all kinds of functions and
you check them by taking derivatives and

433
00:29:17,981 --> 00:29:20,200
make sure to get back your f.
All right.

434
00:29:20,201 --> 00:29:23,560
Suppose this is what we
learned from the map guys.

435
00:29:23,590 --> 00:29:26,380
Then go back to the work energy theater.
I'm and see what it says.

436
00:29:26,381 --> 00:29:28,840
Kid Two minus k one

437
00:29:31,060 --> 00:29:34,390
oh by the way, I didn't complete
one story. Let me finish that.

438
00:29:36,070 --> 00:29:39,790
This was a DFX too.
Was the area from zero to the point x too.

439
00:29:42,080 --> 00:29:45,050
Gfx One is the area from
zero to the point x one.

440
00:29:46,280 --> 00:29:51,280
Then there's perhaps clear to you that
if I only want the area between the

441
00:29:51,810 --> 00:29:56,810
[inaudible] and the point x two I can
take the 80 all the way up to x to

442
00:29:57,650 --> 00:30:01,760
subtract from it the area all the way up
to x one and that's of course the claim

443
00:30:02,150 --> 00:30:03,140
that this integral

444
00:30:04,790 --> 00:30:09,790
f of x Dx from x one two x
two is GFX to find is GFX.

445
00:30:15,960 --> 00:30:16,793
Okay

446
00:30:18,970 --> 00:30:22,760
steps. The reason the integral is
given by a difference of this g,

447
00:30:23,780 --> 00:30:28,780
so let me use a shorthand notation
and call GFX to as simply Jeetu DFX.

448
00:30:29,660 --> 00:30:30,351
One is do you want,

449
00:30:30,351 --> 00:30:33,800
you should understand g two means
g evaluated at the final point.

450
00:30:34,280 --> 00:30:36,140
Do you want to achieve out
of it at the initial point?

451
00:30:37,640 --> 00:30:42,640
So you have got kid two minus K one is
g two minus g one but g is some definite

452
00:30:43,341 --> 00:30:46,040
function of act.
You got to understand that for example,

453
00:30:46,041 --> 00:30:51,041
it could be x to the square over two
minus x one squared over two in the

454
00:30:51,321 --> 00:30:54,610
problem, but f is equal to X. Yeah.

455
00:30:55,320 --> 00:30:57,720
Then let's rearrange this thing to read.

456
00:30:58,230 --> 00:31:03,230
Kid to minus g two is
equal to k one minus g one

457
00:31:09,430 --> 00:31:10,263
yeah,

458
00:31:10,390 --> 00:31:15,390
so the work energy theorem says that
if a forces acting on a body of radial

459
00:31:16,260 --> 00:31:21,260
force associated with the forest is
the function g available function of x,

460
00:31:22,091 --> 00:31:23,740
who's data was the given force.

461
00:31:24,490 --> 00:31:28,360
Then at the beginning if you take the
difference of Kennedy energy minus the

462
00:31:28,361 --> 00:31:30,820
value of d to e be the same,
I'm sorry,

463
00:31:30,830 --> 00:31:34,070
k minus d one it'll be the
same as k two minors, g two

464
00:31:36,220 --> 00:31:38,350
now we don't like the form
in which this is written.

465
00:31:40,370 --> 00:31:44,570
We have to make a little cosmetic change
and the cosmetic chain is to introduce

466
00:31:44,571 --> 00:31:48,650
a function you affects with
this minus this function GFX

467
00:31:51,140 --> 00:31:52,130
so once you do that,

468
00:31:52,131 --> 00:31:57,131
you got to remember now the force is
equal to minus the deliberative at this

469
00:31:57,201 --> 00:32:00,710
function because of the minus
sign of relating g to you.

470
00:32:02,860 --> 00:32:07,860
Then we can write it as kid to bless
you to this k one plus you want.

471
00:32:11,710 --> 00:32:13,060
And that combination,

472
00:32:14,540 --> 00:32:19,540
if you call that as e two and you call
this combination is e one we are saying

473
00:32:20,560 --> 00:32:24,460
[inaudible] equal to t two and that's
called the conservation of energy.

474
00:32:31,160 --> 00:32:32,630
So what does conservation mean?

475
00:32:33,140 --> 00:32:35,900
Conservation of energy in physics
has a totally different meaning from

476
00:32:36,290 --> 00:32:38,060
conservation of energy in daily life.

477
00:32:38,090 --> 00:32:43,090
Here at means when a body's moving on to
the effect of this force ffx you agree

478
00:32:44,751 --> 00:32:47,450
it's gaining speed or losing speed
or doing all kinds of things.

479
00:32:48,740 --> 00:32:51,470
So as it moves around it
speeding up and slowing down.

480
00:32:52,550 --> 00:32:54,170
So it's speed is definitely a variable,

481
00:32:54,950 --> 00:32:59,950
but a certain magic combination connected
to the velocity of the object and to

482
00:33:00,831 --> 00:33:04,670
its location. You depends on x.
That does not change with time.

483
00:33:06,220 --> 00:33:08,870
And there's a bit of useful to know that
does not change with time because if

484
00:33:08,871 --> 00:33:13,400
you knew the value of e even able to
eat to equal to some fixed numbers,

485
00:33:13,430 --> 00:33:16,190
he at one time,
you know he had all of the Times.

486
00:33:17,330 --> 00:33:22,310
So let's take a simple example. So
we take a rock and we dropped it.

487
00:33:22,610 --> 00:33:26,000
We know we're speaking of speed,
we know as losing height.

488
00:33:27,290 --> 00:33:30,500
So you may think maybe that is some
combination of height and speed,

489
00:33:30,950 --> 00:33:35,480
which does not change in this exchange.
And we find the combination by this rule.

490
00:33:35,481 --> 00:33:39,890
Now in the case of gravity,F
is equal to minus AMG.

491
00:33:40,760 --> 00:33:43,580
Therefore you physical the mg times.
Why?

492
00:33:45,170 --> 00:33:47,990
Because mine is dod.
Why will now be my f?

493
00:33:49,100 --> 00:33:54,100
Then we may conclude that
one half MV squared plus Amg,

494
00:33:54,410 --> 00:33:59,410
why are the initial time will be equal
to one half m we two square plus AMG

495
00:34:02,121 --> 00:34:03,920
white too at the final time

496
00:34:09,960 --> 00:34:13,850
and that was the,
and the whole thing can be evaluated.

497
00:34:13,860 --> 00:34:16,320
Any time you take any
random time you want,

498
00:34:16,650 --> 00:34:19,770
the sum of these two numbers
doesn't change. That's the video.

499
00:34:19,771 --> 00:34:20,790
Very powerful results.

500
00:34:22,550 --> 00:34:25,800
So I'm going to give you one more example
later when you can see the power of

501
00:34:25,801 --> 00:34:28,140
this. But in the case of
gravity, this is what it means.

502
00:34:29,190 --> 00:34:33,900
So this agrees with that intuitive
notion that when you lose height,

503
00:34:33,930 --> 00:34:37,290
you gain speed. When you lowered
your why, you gained speed.

504
00:34:37,710 --> 00:34:39,120
But it's much more precise than that.

505
00:34:39,150 --> 00:34:42,990
Instead of saying vaguely
you lose and gain one half.

506
00:34:42,991 --> 00:34:45,510
Mv squared is the part
connected with the speed at mg.

507
00:34:45,511 --> 00:34:48,810
Why is the part connected with height
and that some does not change with time.

508
00:34:51,250 --> 00:34:53,440
So let's go back to the
mass in spring system.

509
00:34:54,010 --> 00:34:55,630
In the case of mass and spring system,

510
00:34:56,200 --> 00:35:00,040
if you have a mass
connected to his spring,

511
00:35:00,730 --> 00:35:01,840
then we say here,

512
00:35:02,260 --> 00:35:07,260
one half Mv Square plus one half k
x square equal to e is a constant.

513
00:35:10,030 --> 00:35:13,000
That means find it at any initial time,

514
00:35:13,001 --> 00:35:16,960
one fighter that any final
time to add these two numbers,

515
00:35:17,260 --> 00:35:18,580
that portal will not change.

516
00:35:23,070 --> 00:35:26,760
So let me put that to
work. Let me use that. Uh,

517
00:35:27,810 --> 00:35:30,450
let me use that in a,
in a calculation.

518
00:35:31,770 --> 00:35:34,380
So I say,
here's the spring,

519
00:35:36,410 --> 00:35:40,860
here's where it to be.
I'm going to pull it to a new location.

520
00:35:40,950 --> 00:35:44,040
A X equals zero is where
the spring likes to be.

521
00:35:44,100 --> 00:35:47,010
I'm going to pull it by an amount
a and I'm going to let it go.

522
00:35:48,570 --> 00:35:52,880
And I want to know how fast the guy is
moving when it comes back to say x equals

523
00:35:52,890 --> 00:35:57,540
zero.
If you go back to Newton's laws,

524
00:35:57,570 --> 00:35:59,070
it's a pretty complicated problem.

525
00:36:00,150 --> 00:36:04,890
You've got to think about why it's a
complicated problem because you start with

526
00:36:04,891 --> 00:36:09,060
a mass at rest. If you pull it by
an amount, a a force acting on it,

527
00:36:09,061 --> 00:36:14,061
it'd be minus k times a that'll produce
his tiny accelerate will produce an

528
00:36:14,071 --> 00:36:16,140
acceleration right k over them,

529
00:36:16,950 --> 00:36:19,980
which will give it a new velocity
by the time it comes here,

530
00:36:21,120 --> 00:36:24,270
but once it comes to the new location,
little later,

531
00:36:24,570 --> 00:36:27,780
a different forces acting on it
because the x is now different,

532
00:36:28,410 --> 00:36:31,980
so the acceleration and during this
interval is different and the gain in

533
00:36:31,981 --> 00:36:34,800
velocity that interval will be different
from that in the first interval.

534
00:36:35,080 --> 00:36:37,950
You've got to add all these
changes to find the velocity here.

535
00:36:38,790 --> 00:36:42,750
That's a difficult proposition, but
with the law of conservation of energy,

536
00:36:43,680 --> 00:36:46,410
you do that in one second.
In fact,

537
00:36:46,411 --> 00:36:48,660
let's do with not just to
be at the midpoint here,

538
00:36:48,960 --> 00:36:53,960
but at any point x measured
from equilibrium because
we will say initially one

539
00:36:56,311 --> 00:36:57,121
half Mv,

540
00:36:57,121 --> 00:37:02,121
one square plus one half k x one square
is equal to one half m B two square plus

541
00:37:06,301 --> 00:37:10,620
one half k x two square.
This is the truth.

542
00:37:10,680 --> 00:37:13,080
This is a constant,
does not change with time.

543
00:37:14,070 --> 00:37:17,400
Now to get some mileage out of this, you
got to know what the constant value is.

544
00:37:17,960 --> 00:37:22,460
Well, we know what it is in the beginning
because when we pulled this guy or that

545
00:37:22,461 --> 00:37:23,294
instant,

546
00:37:23,430 --> 00:37:28,430
we knew it had no velocity and we knew
it was sitting at the point a so we know

547
00:37:29,760 --> 00:37:34,050
one half k square. That is the total
energy of this mass and spring system.

548
00:37:35,100 --> 00:37:39,540
That's not going to change with time.
We like to say that at the initial time,

549
00:37:39,750 --> 00:37:41,640
all the energies,
potential energy,

550
00:37:41,820 --> 00:37:46,560
there is no kinetic energy because there
was no motion on any subsequent time.

551
00:37:46,590 --> 00:37:49,920
This number has to be
equal to what you get.

552
00:37:50,320 --> 00:37:52,000
Let me drop the subscript two there.

553
00:37:52,010 --> 00:37:56,460
Let the Stanford some generic instant
in the future. This much we know

554
00:37:58,140 --> 00:38:00,630
now do you see that we
can solve for the velocity

555
00:38:02,130 --> 00:38:06,420
on any location x, you pick the x. If
you want x to be zero, that's very easy.

556
00:38:06,810 --> 00:38:09,270
You kill that term.
You balance these two,

557
00:38:09,480 --> 00:38:12,840
you cancel the half and you can
see there's a formula for v Square.

558
00:38:13,710 --> 00:38:16,520
The square is going to
be k is where over and

559
00:38:19,200 --> 00:38:22,440
that is going to be the velocity
when their swings by this midpoint.

560
00:38:23,760 --> 00:38:28,260
But you can pick any x you like if they
x was not zero but 0.1 we'll put the

561
00:38:28,261 --> 00:38:31,020
0.1,
take it to the other side and solve for v

562
00:38:32,940 --> 00:38:35,010
this one example of the law
of conservation of energy.

563
00:38:35,830 --> 00:38:39,160
So the part of the law of conservation of
energy. If you knew the initial energy,

564
00:38:39,610 --> 00:38:43,620
you don't have to go through Newton's
laws and you will find an all the problem

565
00:38:43,621 --> 00:38:48,340
sets and many exams when a problem has
given to you and you're told find the

566
00:38:48,341 --> 00:38:52,120
velocity of something you should try
whenever possible to use the law of

567
00:38:52,121 --> 00:38:55,390
conservation of energy rather
than going to Newton's laws.

568
00:38:56,530 --> 00:38:58,510
So if you want to know what have we done,

569
00:39:00,040 --> 00:39:05,020
how come finding the velocity seem so
difficult when I described it earlier than

570
00:39:05,040 --> 00:39:07,150
Dendrite, we have done
it. The answer to this,

571
00:39:07,180 --> 00:39:10,150
if you tell me the force of
the spring is a function of x.

572
00:39:10,570 --> 00:39:15,570
I have done that integral in the work
energy theater them once and for all.

573
00:39:16,740 --> 00:39:19,600
The integral of the spring force has
been integrated once and for all,

574
00:39:19,870 --> 00:39:21,640
and that's what the
potential energy is doing.

575
00:39:22,300 --> 00:39:25,210
Potential energy comes from
integrating that force.

576
00:39:27,370 --> 00:39:27,760
All right,

577
00:39:27,760 --> 00:39:32,760
so now let's take another problem
where there are two forces.

578
00:39:32,891 --> 00:39:33,724
Act.
Yes,

579
00:39:39,160 --> 00:39:42,870
I,
let me see here at the bottom of

580
00:39:44,590 --> 00:39:48,700
here. Is it just me going to be
integration? Yeah, for the spring,

581
00:39:49,120 --> 00:39:52,840
I think we said here,
if the force is x,

582
00:39:53,620 --> 00:39:58,620
the potential energy is a g is equal
x squared over two you will be minus x

583
00:39:58,751 --> 00:40:01,810
squared over to serve the forces minus Kx.

584
00:40:03,460 --> 00:40:08,460
Then you have to find the you so that
minus the UDX is equal to minus Kx and the

585
00:40:10,301 --> 00:40:13,130
answer that is used cake squared over two.

586
00:40:15,220 --> 00:40:19,590
So if you knew the force or you just
find the function you by asking who's

587
00:40:19,600 --> 00:40:22,870
derivative gives me the minus sign,
then you are done.

588
00:40:22,900 --> 00:40:24,700
That's a potential
energy for that problem.

589
00:40:27,940 --> 00:40:31,690
Now let's take another problem.
A masters hanging from the ceiling.

590
00:40:34,010 --> 00:40:35,810
Ben has got two kinds of potential energy.

591
00:40:36,350 --> 00:40:39,460
One is just the gravitational
potential energy and others,

592
00:40:39,470 --> 00:40:44,470
the spring potential energy that's going
to come because k two minus k one will

593
00:40:44,581 --> 00:40:49,100
be the integral of f of X. Dx.
I'm sorry. Let's call it the why.

594
00:40:49,480 --> 00:40:52,010
Why the why from y one two white too.

595
00:40:52,760 --> 00:40:56,510
And this f of why you will have two parts.
The force of gravity,

596
00:40:57,560 --> 00:41:00,860
I'm tired of writing the limits.
Then the force of the spring

597
00:41:02,870 --> 00:41:07,400
from one to two, from one to two, right?

598
00:41:07,401 --> 00:41:08,690
There are two forces acting on it.

599
00:41:09,470 --> 00:41:14,080
This one will be mg

600
00:41:16,230 --> 00:41:19,040
white, two minus AMG. Why One?

601
00:41:20,570 --> 00:41:25,570
This one will be one half k y two
square minus one half k y one square.

602
00:41:29,780 --> 00:41:34,780
So every force acting on the body will
turn into a potential because the force,

603
00:41:35,270 --> 00:41:38,810
Newton's law says work energy theater.
I'm applies to the total force.

604
00:41:39,530 --> 00:41:43,430
The Tour de force is two parts and you
can do to integrate those eaten tegretol

605
00:41:43,431 --> 00:41:47,870
is an upper limit minus lower limit of
some function. And this is what you get.

606
00:41:48,980 --> 00:41:52,160
Oh, I think I made one mistake here. Uh,

607
00:41:55,960 --> 00:42:00,850
I think they should give me,
yes, this is overall sinus Ron.

608
00:42:01,110 --> 00:42:05,890
In these equations. Really that's
a minus in that minus, in that,

609
00:42:05,950 --> 00:42:08,590
in other words,
the work done by the force.

610
00:42:09,960 --> 00:42:14,440
There's only one force
acting. It's really you. One.

611
00:42:15,140 --> 00:42:19,810
Mine is youtube.
You see why I got the sign wrong?

612
00:42:20,490 --> 00:42:22,360
When you do the integral in calculus,

613
00:42:22,690 --> 00:42:26,740
integral of FSG to minus g one but
g and you are minuses of each other,

614
00:42:27,350 --> 00:42:30,280
so integral of force of give
you you initially minus,

615
00:42:30,281 --> 00:42:34,320
you finally said it should really
be plus MTY one minus m g white too,

616
00:42:36,160 --> 00:42:40,990
so the law of conservation of energy
for this object will be that one half MV

617
00:42:40,991 --> 00:42:45,991
squared plus m g y plus one half k white
square is the total energy and will not

618
00:42:49,871 --> 00:42:54,850
change this mask and bump up
and down and go back and forth.

619
00:42:55,300 --> 00:42:57,730
If you knew the turtle up these
three numbers at one instant,

620
00:42:58,300 --> 00:43:01,960
you know the value at any other instance.
For example,

621
00:43:02,110 --> 00:43:05,950
if you pulled it from his equilibrium
by 0.2 centimeters and they released it

622
00:43:06,400 --> 00:43:09,400
and you say, what's the speed?
When it's 0.1 centimeters away,

623
00:43:09,670 --> 00:43:14,290
it's been easy because you know the
initial energy was all spring energy and

624
00:43:14,291 --> 00:43:17,800
gravitational energy or any later time.
If you knew the why,

625
00:43:17,860 --> 00:43:21,220
if you knew the position, you know the
potential in it. That's the whole point.

626
00:43:21,400 --> 00:43:23,920
Potential energy depends on where you are.
Kennedy,

627
00:43:23,940 --> 00:43:28,240
Kennedy depends on how fast you're moving
and some combination of value water

628
00:43:28,241 --> 00:43:31,780
and how fast you're moving is
invariant does not change with time.

629
00:43:32,110 --> 00:43:35,140
So if you're telling me where you are,
I will tell you how fast you're moving.

630
00:43:36,820 --> 00:43:40,330
By the way, uh, I remember the
kinetic energy enters as v Square.

631
00:43:41,140 --> 00:43:44,230
You can imagine when you solve for we,
you're always going to get two answers.

632
00:43:47,190 --> 00:43:49,740
Why is that? Does it make any sense? Yes.

633
00:43:50,210 --> 00:43:51,160
You're going to have the same

634
00:43:53,230 --> 00:43:58,230
energy with your oscillating [inaudible].

635
00:43:59,240 --> 00:44:02,880
If a spring is going back and forth,
are they given point x?

636
00:44:02,881 --> 00:44:07,000
You can have two velocities because you
could be going away from the center or

637
00:44:07,010 --> 00:44:09,150
you can be going back towards the center.

638
00:44:09,630 --> 00:44:13,920
So this tells you the velocity on those
two will be donated by a minus sign,

639
00:44:14,850 --> 00:44:18,180
right? If you pull the spring this way
when you go through the audit and you say,

640
00:44:18,181 --> 00:44:21,600
watch my velocity, I'll get two answers
because I could be going to the origin,

641
00:44:22,270 --> 00:44:25,020
I could go the other way.
And on the way back again past the origin.

642
00:44:25,050 --> 00:44:29,460
So every x you will get two velocities
and that agrees well with the fact that

643
00:44:29,790 --> 00:44:32,670
we squared is what you will for
and because it's quite radic,

644
00:44:32,671 --> 00:44:35,460
you will get two answers and
you should get two answers.

645
00:44:35,490 --> 00:44:39,540
You should be expecting that.
Okay,

646
00:44:39,600 --> 00:44:44,580
now we're going to find one
bad boy, bad girl, bad person,

647
00:44:44,730 --> 00:44:46,710
which is going to ruin this whole thing.

648
00:44:48,980 --> 00:44:49,813
That is,

649
00:44:50,400 --> 00:44:52,290
you know what I'm talking about here?
Yes.

650
00:44:54,070 --> 00:44:58,200
So friction is a force acting on a body.

651
00:44:58,650 --> 00:45:00,630
So what's the thing I should try to do?

652
00:45:01,230 --> 00:45:03,270
Let's take a body with the
only friction acting on it.

653
00:45:03,300 --> 00:45:06,480
Let's not worry about anything else
or maybe friction at the spring.

654
00:45:07,020 --> 00:45:11,460
So I try as usual to get
a law of conservation of
energy and friction is acting

655
00:45:12,150 --> 00:45:14,100
and you will see that I will not succeed

656
00:45:15,840 --> 00:45:19,620
and it looks like everything
here is watertight, right?

657
00:45:20,700 --> 00:45:23,760
Everything looks good.
You'll tell me the force acting on a body.

658
00:45:24,120 --> 00:45:27,730
I integrate the force from start to
finish and I call that the difference or

659
00:45:27,731 --> 00:45:30,480
potential energies.
Then I've got my results.

660
00:45:30,950 --> 00:45:34,800
Try to follow this logic with care.
Two minus Kevin has integrated the force.

661
00:45:35,340 --> 00:45:40,170
Integral is GX two minors,
dx one or which is UX one minus UX too.

662
00:45:40,350 --> 00:45:43,860
You can rearrange it to get care to
plus you to escape and plus you want,

663
00:45:43,890 --> 00:45:47,640
it looks like you can always get la
conservation of energy and we want to know

664
00:45:47,641 --> 00:45:49,900
why that fails when there is friction.

665
00:45:51,630 --> 00:45:55,710
Why does it fail when there's friction?
So when there is friction,

666
00:45:55,890 --> 00:45:57,030
let me try to do it again.

667
00:45:58,340 --> 00:46:03,340
Can't two minus k one is the force
due to the spring with this whatever,

668
00:46:03,511 --> 00:46:07,320
minus k x. Let me do that. Integral
plus the force of friction.

669
00:46:07,890 --> 00:46:12,390
DX from x one, two x two.
This one is from x one,

670
00:46:12,391 --> 00:46:15,900
two x two and we saw what this is.
Let me write it one more time.

671
00:46:15,990 --> 00:46:20,990
One half k x one square is
one half k excuse squared.

672
00:46:21,091 --> 00:46:21,960
If you didn't have friction,

673
00:46:21,961 --> 00:46:26,340
you are done because you can get kinetic
plus potential for spraying is Kennedy

674
00:46:26,341 --> 00:46:27,174
plus potential.

675
00:46:31,670 --> 00:46:34,850
Why don't we just integrate
the force of friction

676
00:46:35,810 --> 00:46:36,643
and then

677
00:46:37,530 --> 00:46:41,220
turn that into a u and then we're done.
What's going to be the problem? Let me,

678
00:46:41,370 --> 00:46:43,590
let me just give some,
anybody else want? Yes.

679
00:46:44,010 --> 00:46:44,843
Uh,

680
00:46:47,620 --> 00:46:51,750
there would be always we change direction.

681
00:46:52,780 --> 00:46:54,850
Okay.
What does your

682
00:46:55,970 --> 00:46:59,240
can associate a potential function?
Friction.

683
00:46:59,241 --> 00:47:03,950
Because it depends on the path that will
lead the initial position in the final

684
00:47:05,070 --> 00:47:08,650
vehicle.
He considers the final and the additional

685
00:47:08,820 --> 00:47:12,690
right, but let's suppose I'm somewhere
and I'm pulling a block and there is some

686
00:47:12,691 --> 00:47:16,230
friction that is a force F
at the location. That's my f.

687
00:47:16,470 --> 00:47:18,270
Why don't they just use the value of f?

688
00:47:19,640 --> 00:47:23,390
Yes.
Pardon me.

689
00:47:25,380 --> 00:47:28,080
I know, but see you are saying
something else which is speaking.

690
00:47:28,081 --> 00:47:32,380
I head into into the book but right now
what's the problem with integrating the

691
00:47:32,381 --> 00:47:33,310
force of friction?
Yes.

692
00:47:34,350 --> 00:47:39,350
I was just going to say
[inaudible] the one in the system.

693
00:47:41,060 --> 00:47:44,540
No, but you're all telling me why
that is a loss of mechanical energy,

694
00:47:44,541 --> 00:47:47,900
but I'm just a mathematician. I'm
saying give me a force. Find Integrity.

695
00:47:47,960 --> 00:47:48,980
What's the problem?
Yes.

696
00:47:49,240 --> 00:47:52,360
All right.
Is it because the function for the course?

697
00:47:53,950 --> 00:47:56,440
Yes. I think somebody else
said that earlier. Also,

698
00:47:57,160 --> 00:48:01,000
the force of friction
is not a function of x.

699
00:48:02,140 --> 00:48:03,880
You might say,
what do you mean I'm pushing this guy.

700
00:48:03,881 --> 00:48:05,500
I know how hard is pushing me back,

701
00:48:05,920 --> 00:48:08,980
but I'm telling you not push it
the opposite way than you'd find.

702
00:48:08,981 --> 00:48:12,490
The force of friction at the very same
location is pointing in a different

703
00:48:12,491 --> 00:48:13,324
direction.

704
00:48:14,800 --> 00:48:19,210
Where does the force of his spring is?
The force of the spring.

705
00:48:19,600 --> 00:48:20,580
It's minus k x.

706
00:48:20,590 --> 00:48:23,650
Whether they are going towards the spring
are going away from the spring. Right?

707
00:48:23,690 --> 00:48:25,720
Think about that.
Same with gravity.

708
00:48:26,470 --> 00:48:30,460
Gravity is pulling you down with the
force minus mg and it doesn't care whether

709
00:48:30,461 --> 00:48:32,950
the chalk is going up or
coming down on the way up.

710
00:48:32,951 --> 00:48:37,230
It's pulling it down on the way down
is also pulling it down because at the

711
00:48:37,231 --> 00:48:39,730
given location that is a fixed force,

712
00:48:40,630 --> 00:48:43,120
so the problem is not the
force Beatty's with x or y,

713
00:48:43,121 --> 00:48:45,790
but the force is a function only affects,

714
00:48:46,390 --> 00:48:50,650
but if the function of x and velocity
then you also have to know the velocity

715
00:48:50,651 --> 00:48:54,370
and no one's giving you then definite
value for the velocity because of the

716
00:48:54,371 --> 00:48:57,250
vibrating mass in spring
velocity can have either signed,

717
00:48:58,840 --> 00:49:03,000
therefore we do this integral
but we don't do this.

718
00:49:03,000 --> 00:49:04,270
Even though I write it this way,

719
00:49:04,360 --> 00:49:08,050
mathematically is wrong because the force
of friction is it really a function of

720
00:49:08,051 --> 00:49:12,100
x? I'll tell you in what limited since
it is a function and what technical

721
00:49:12,101 --> 00:49:14,140
sensitive spot,
let's defer that for now.

722
00:49:14,590 --> 00:49:18,400
Take all these guys to the left hand side,
so this is Cape too.

723
00:49:19,170 --> 00:49:22,900
This'll become youtube so you
will get kid too. Plus you two

724
00:49:25,000 --> 00:49:30,000
minus k one plus one is
equal to this last thing.

725
00:49:30,930 --> 00:49:35,140
Then by friction the x from x one two
x two and the question is can I do the

726
00:49:35,141 --> 00:49:38,860
integral? The answer is if you just
tell me x one and x two that no,

727
00:49:38,861 --> 00:49:39,850
that's the point you're making.

728
00:49:40,060 --> 00:49:43,270
I cannot just do an integral because
I will have to know the whole story,

729
00:49:44,380 --> 00:49:48,900
but in limited cases I can do this.
Suppose I pulled the mass by an emote a

730
00:49:50,590 --> 00:49:53,080
and I let it go,
but now that is friction.

731
00:49:54,910 --> 00:49:57,400
I think we all know that
if it can be at the center,

732
00:49:57,760 --> 00:50:02,500
it won't be going quite as fast and we
also know when it overshoots the other

733
00:50:02,501 --> 00:50:06,790
side, it will not go back to minus say
normally it would go back to minus eight.

734
00:50:08,080 --> 00:50:10,540
Everyone knows why it goes
back to minus a right.

735
00:50:10,600 --> 00:50:13,030
When you go to the other
extremity without friction,

736
00:50:13,650 --> 00:50:18,130
you're energy is all potential. If
there's one half k's square to begin with,

737
00:50:18,340 --> 00:50:22,280
it's got to be one half k squared at
the end except ache and become minus day

738
00:50:22,281 --> 00:50:25,150
without changing the answer. That's
why you go from a two minus minuses,

739
00:50:25,540 --> 00:50:29,720
but when you got friction cannot say
the energy at equal cause I got do this

740
00:50:29,721 --> 00:50:34,520
integral for this part of the
journey from here to here.

741
00:50:35,840 --> 00:50:38,960
During that part, the journey, the
force is a well defined function.

742
00:50:39,440 --> 00:50:44,440
Namely it is a constant value minus
mew times mg and it is acting this way

743
00:50:47,000 --> 00:50:50,240
so but this part of the trip I can do the
integrators very easy to find out what

744
00:50:50,241 --> 00:50:53,310
it is.
It's minus M g times music,

745
00:50:53,311 --> 00:50:55,790
kinetic times the distance traveled.

746
00:50:58,070 --> 00:50:59,720
Of course there's a
little more complicated.

747
00:50:59,721 --> 00:51:02,570
Now you have to tell me where
you want your velocity's.

748
00:51:03,440 --> 00:51:08,440
You might say find the velocity at x
equal to zero if you want me to do that.

749
00:51:08,750 --> 00:51:12,230
The distance is travels is
the original displacement.

750
00:51:13,550 --> 00:51:18,550
That's what is the stuff on that site
and here cape to is one half Mv Square,

751
00:51:20,030 --> 00:51:21,350
which is what I'm trying to find.

752
00:51:22,010 --> 00:51:26,390
I am on the origin so it's one
half kid times zero square,

753
00:51:27,890 --> 00:51:32,890
no potential energy initially that it
was no candidate energy but that was

754
00:51:32,991 --> 00:51:35,030
potential energy.
One half k square.

755
00:51:37,930 --> 00:51:39,040
You follow that logic.

756
00:51:39,041 --> 00:51:42,980
Now this is the difference in energies
due to the conserved forces that are

757
00:51:42,990 --> 00:51:43,930
conserved energies,

758
00:51:44,290 --> 00:51:48,610
but the difference e two minus e one
is no longer zero but is given by this

759
00:51:48,611 --> 00:51:53,110
number so I can calculate it
for this part. I can even ask.

760
00:51:53,140 --> 00:51:56,170
This is one of the homework problems.
I think you are asked,

761
00:51:56,171 --> 00:51:57,580
how far does it go to the left?

762
00:51:59,650 --> 00:52:01,210
Well what do you do?

763
00:52:02,650 --> 00:52:04,660
Let's call the place where it goes to,

764
00:52:04,990 --> 00:52:07,720
to the leftmost extremity as a prime.

765
00:52:10,350 --> 00:52:11,230
Then we don't know.

766
00:52:14,050 --> 00:52:18,340
So there when you go to the k two plus
you two minus k one plus you one you will

767
00:52:18,341 --> 00:52:21,220
go back to this formula.
First of all,

768
00:52:21,670 --> 00:52:26,670
the distance that the force of friction
acts on is how much is a distance a to

769
00:52:28,751 --> 00:52:32,710
come here and another day
prime to go to the left.

770
00:52:32,830 --> 00:52:35,140
A prime is a magnitude of
how far do you go to the left

771
00:52:36,970 --> 00:52:41,260
and likewise on the left hand side you've
got to have the throat candidate plus

772
00:52:41,261 --> 00:52:44,560
potential miners. Kinetic plus
potential are the end of the day.

773
00:52:44,561 --> 00:52:48,640
You only have potential energy.
One half k n Prime Square,

774
00:52:48,670 --> 00:52:52,720
no candidate in initially. Again,
you only had potential energy,

775
00:52:52,990 --> 00:52:54,190
one half k square.

776
00:52:56,200 --> 00:53:00,370
You will see that a prime now satisfies
a quadratic equation. They can solve it,

777
00:53:05,210 --> 00:53:06,740
but what is the point?

778
00:53:06,770 --> 00:53:11,770
The point is you cannot do this integral
once and for all and say the answer

779
00:53:12,381 --> 00:53:16,820
depends on the on the end points
in this particular problem.

780
00:53:17,780 --> 00:53:21,860
If you're told me you're doing this part
of the journey during that part of the

781
00:53:21,861 --> 00:53:26,010
journey, because for the entire trip,
the velocity had a particular sign,

782
00:53:26,280 --> 00:53:27,730
namely to the left force.

783
00:53:27,731 --> 00:53:31,170
The friction had a definite and
magnitude and sign namely to the right.

784
00:53:31,350 --> 00:53:35,040
And then of course it's as good as any
legitimate function and you can do the

785
00:53:35,041 --> 00:53:37,410
integral. In fact, the
force is a constant.

786
00:53:37,800 --> 00:53:41,550
You can pull it out of the integral and
integral dx is just the distance travel.

787
00:53:43,850 --> 00:53:44,600
Okay,

788
00:53:44,600 --> 00:53:48,770
so work done by friction and they will
always come out negative and you should

789
00:53:48,771 --> 00:53:49,604
keep track of that.

790
00:53:53,610 --> 00:53:53,881
Okay,

791
00:53:53,881 --> 00:53:58,881
so the final bottom line
for law of conservation of
energy that you guys should

792
00:54:00,211 --> 00:54:01,560
remember is the following.

793
00:54:03,240 --> 00:54:05,280
You take all the forces acting on a body,

794
00:54:05,520 --> 00:54:09,090
so let's do it one more time in our head
so you know where everything comes from.

795
00:54:09,780 --> 00:54:11,220
Everything comes from this result.

796
00:54:11,700 --> 00:54:16,700
K Two minus k one which is the work
done is the integral of all the forces,

797
00:54:19,910 --> 00:54:23,910
the forces into forces that depend on
location only and not on anything else

798
00:54:23,940 --> 00:54:27,630
like velocity.
Let me just divide them into two forces.

799
00:54:28,200 --> 00:54:33,200
One is the good force at Dx
and one is a force of friction.

800
00:54:34,170 --> 00:54:35,003
Yes,

801
00:54:35,550 --> 00:54:39,210
this guy will turn into
potential energy difference.

802
00:54:39,240 --> 00:54:44,240
Let me just take one good force and the
force of friction if he had to eat will

803
00:54:44,461 --> 00:54:46,790
generate its own potential.
When you do the integral,

804
00:54:47,760 --> 00:54:52,760
then we made then say e two minus e one
effect the same as k two plus two minus

805
00:54:55,891 --> 00:55:00,891
k one plus one is equal to the work done
by friction work done by friction is

806
00:55:02,171 --> 00:55:04,650
the shorthand for that integral,

807
00:55:04,680 --> 00:55:09,680
which you can do only you must divide
the motion involved into pieces.

808
00:55:10,650 --> 00:55:15,150
For example, if you have a massive
swing to the left, then turns it on,

809
00:55:15,151 --> 00:55:17,610
goes back to the right. Of course. Again,

810
00:55:17,611 --> 00:55:20,370
it won't come back to the original
AEL company, smaller number.

811
00:55:21,180 --> 00:55:23,790
That's because there's more loss
of energy on the return trip.

812
00:55:24,300 --> 00:55:27,990
For the return trip. You must do the
problem separately on on the return trip.

813
00:55:28,290 --> 00:55:31,830
You start from this a prime that you
found that started moving to the right,

814
00:55:31,980 --> 00:55:34,860
no friction will act to
the left soon as Dubai,

815
00:55:34,870 --> 00:55:37,560
the Morson at the segments
during each segment,

816
00:55:37,561 --> 00:55:40,830
the force should have a definite
direction and magnitude so you can do the

817
00:55:40,840 --> 00:55:41,673
integral.

818
00:55:42,510 --> 00:55:46,350
The point is there is no universal
formula for ffx due to friction,

819
00:55:48,070 --> 00:55:51,600
so in one dimension, that's all it
is. Between the good and bad forces,

820
00:55:52,020 --> 00:55:55,770
those which lead to potential,
those were don't the differences.

821
00:55:55,771 --> 00:56:00,420
The good forces are functions of x bad
forces at functions of x and something

822
00:56:00,421 --> 00:56:01,920
else so that are they given x.

823
00:56:02,220 --> 00:56:04,350
It's possible to have two
values for that function.

824
00:56:04,770 --> 00:56:06,450
Bathymetrically we don't
call it a function.

825
00:56:06,960 --> 00:56:09,480
That's why you cannot do the
integral once and for all.

826
00:56:09,900 --> 00:56:14,160
So this is the law of
conservation of energy. Okay?

827
00:56:14,720 --> 00:56:17,130
All right.
Now what I have to do

828
00:56:18,810 --> 00:56:23,810
here for the remaining time is a little
more of some mathematical preparation

829
00:56:26,291 --> 00:56:27,820
for what I'm going to do next.

830
00:56:28,810 --> 00:56:32,380
What I'm going to do next is to go to
higher dimensions and we got to make sure

831
00:56:32,381 --> 00:56:36,070
we all know some of the mathematical
ideas connected with higher dimensions.

832
00:56:37,120 --> 00:56:40,510
So I'm going to start off with some
things and this is like a mathematical

833
00:56:40,960 --> 00:56:45,250
interlude. Again, I told you if you're
not strong on some of these things,

834
00:56:45,251 --> 00:56:48,340
you should read this math book I
mentioned to you on basic training.

835
00:56:48,580 --> 00:56:51,190
We'll certainly cover these topics,
but you don't have to have that.

836
00:56:51,191 --> 00:56:53,380
I'm going to tell you now how to do it.

837
00:56:55,060 --> 00:57:00,060
So the math idea that I'm going to use
this really a mathematical digression to

838
00:57:00,881 --> 00:57:04,150
make sure everybody knows.
They're very simple things,

839
00:57:04,151 --> 00:57:05,900
but we do it all the time in physics.

840
00:57:05,901 --> 00:57:10,660
So I want to make sure you guys can also
do that. So let's take some function

841
00:57:12,520 --> 00:57:16,690
ffx that looks like this.
This is f of x,

842
00:57:18,770 --> 00:57:19,603
this is x.

843
00:57:22,780 --> 00:57:27,500
And let's say you start here at some
point x and I'm going to go to the nearby

844
00:57:27,530 --> 00:57:32,530
point x Plus Delta X.

845
00:57:32,680 --> 00:57:35,750
Delta x is exaggerated so you can see it,

846
00:57:36,480 --> 00:57:39,130
so it's actually in the end
going to be a very small number.

847
00:57:39,920 --> 00:57:40,753
Okay.

848
00:57:43,010 --> 00:57:48,010
The question is what is the change in the
function in going from here to here so

849
00:57:49,280 --> 00:57:52,550
we all know what it is that
is a change in the function.

850
00:57:53,290 --> 00:57:54,123
Okay.

851
00:57:57,140 --> 00:57:59,780
We are going to need approximations
to the change of the function.

852
00:58:00,280 --> 00:58:01,113
Okay.

853
00:58:02,300 --> 00:58:04,880
Useful approximation is to say,

854
00:58:05,060 --> 00:58:08,780
let's put it on the function as a straight
line and keeps going with the slope

855
00:58:08,781 --> 00:58:09,920
it had to begin with.

856
00:58:12,070 --> 00:58:12,440
Yeah.

857
00:58:12,440 --> 00:58:15,500
You can see that if the function is
not curving up or down two months,

858
00:58:15,770 --> 00:58:20,390
you almost got the right change in f
and what does that change in f?

859
00:58:20,720 --> 00:58:23,550
That change in f is the
derivative of the functions

860
00:58:25,730 --> 00:58:28,520
at the point x times the change in x.

861
00:58:30,850 --> 00:58:31,400
Okay,

862
00:58:31,400 --> 00:58:36,400
but it is not an equality
is not inequality because
that is this little guy on

863
00:58:36,741 --> 00:58:41,741
the top that you have missed because
the function is not following the same

864
00:58:42,081 --> 00:58:44,290
slope that you have to begin with.
It's curving up.

865
00:58:44,990 --> 00:58:49,670
So let's take a concrete example.
Suppose ffx is equal to x squared,

866
00:58:51,110 --> 00:58:56,110
then F of x Plus Delta x is x squared
plus two x Delta x plus Delta x squared.

867
00:59:02,270 --> 00:59:04,820
Therefore the change in after you
got to take her to the other side,

868
00:59:05,270 --> 00:59:09,650
pain change your Naf is two x
Delta x plus Delta x squared,

869
00:59:11,520 --> 00:59:15,440
two x Delta Act two x is of course
what you realize is the delivery.

870
00:59:15,470 --> 00:59:17,300
We have to function at that point

871
00:59:19,010 --> 00:59:20,630
and that's giving you this part,

872
00:59:21,380 --> 00:59:25,190
but that's a tiny portion on the top
which is delta x squared that you're not

873
00:59:25,191 --> 00:59:26,024
getting

874
00:59:27,150 --> 00:59:30,530
the function as x cube at x to the
fourth that hyperbolic Karsh affects.

875
00:59:30,531 --> 00:59:31,640
That'll be more editors,

876
00:59:32,210 --> 00:59:36,620
but the point is the change in the
function has the leading piece that's

877
00:59:36,621 --> 00:59:37,760
proportional delta x.

878
00:59:38,120 --> 00:59:42,560
Then the correction that
we say mathematically are
of higher order in Delta x,

879
00:59:46,210 --> 00:59:49,390
so you've dealt,
the x is made very small but not zero.

880
00:59:50,590 --> 00:59:54,310
Then it a bit of useful formula to know
that the change in function and going

881
00:59:54,311 --> 00:59:58,210
from one point to another point is
this rate of change times to change.

882
00:59:58,720 --> 01:00:00,820
I don't think anything could
be more natural than that,

883
01:00:01,930 --> 01:00:06,910
but we should be comfortable
by saying, uh, it's natively.

884
01:00:06,911 --> 01:00:07,541
People say,
well,

885
01:00:07,541 --> 01:00:10,930
you should do that because in calculus
you're canceling this delta x with that

886
01:00:10,931 --> 01:00:12,730
dx.
That's not what we're really doing.

887
01:00:13,030 --> 01:00:15,610
We all know that the
Stanford a certain limit,

888
01:00:16,000 --> 01:00:19,990
but the limit stance literally for
the slope, which is at that point,

889
01:00:21,100 --> 01:00:25,030
so he functions had only one slope and
they never changed the slope and he knew

890
01:00:25,031 --> 01:00:27,430
that slope.
Then if you know the value to begin with,

891
01:00:27,640 --> 01:00:30,520
you can find the value of miles away
from where you are because it's going at

892
01:00:30,521 --> 01:00:32,620
the same clip.
But most functions,

893
01:00:32,621 --> 01:00:37,621
of course we'll change the slope and for
that reason the Fed will be an error in

894
01:00:38,321 --> 01:00:42,670
the formula you get if you use this.
But if delta x is very,

895
01:00:42,671 --> 01:00:45,850
very small and it's your end,
is your intention in the end to make very,

896
01:00:45,851 --> 01:00:50,510
very tiny delta axes,
then we say we will use this approximate.

897
01:00:53,680 --> 01:00:56,190
That's pretty simple,
but it's very useful to know.

898
01:00:58,470 --> 01:01:01,080
So let's take a example of this function.

899
01:01:03,390 --> 01:01:05,480
Have this rule because I'm
going to use it all the time.

900
01:01:10,230 --> 01:01:15,230
So one example is f of
x is equal to one plus x

901
01:01:16,750 --> 01:01:18,530
to the N.

902
01:01:21,800 --> 01:01:22,850
Well f one

903
01:01:25,800 --> 01:01:26,730
it's just one.

904
01:01:29,380 --> 01:01:33,810
Suppose you go to a nearby point
which is x away from the 0.1.

905
01:01:34,080 --> 01:01:38,880
So this x is really like your delta x.
Then the change of the function,

906
01:01:40,230 --> 01:01:41,640
we be DF DX

907
01:01:43,380 --> 01:01:46,200
at the 0.1 times the change in x.

908
01:01:49,200 --> 01:01:50,033
Yes,

909
01:01:53,790 --> 01:01:58,380
I'm sorry. Ah, okay. That's
right. F of zero if you like.

910
01:01:58,440 --> 01:02:00,840
If x is equal to zero,
the function as a value one.

911
01:02:02,710 --> 01:02:03,390
Okay.

912
01:02:03,390 --> 01:02:06,900
Then if you go to the neighboring point,
so here's what I'm saying, function.

913
01:02:06,901 --> 01:02:10,740
There's something, it's a value. Here is
one and I wanted to go to a nearby point,

914
01:02:11,180 --> 01:02:12,210
which I'm calling x.

915
01:02:13,440 --> 01:02:18,440
Then dfds do you know is n times one
plus x to the n minus one same sex,

916
01:02:20,430 --> 01:02:24,600
but do you have to evaluate it at
x equals zero so this goes away.

917
01:02:25,030 --> 01:02:27,840
Then you get an x.

918
01:02:30,540 --> 01:02:31,860
So the tangent,
the function,

919
01:02:32,070 --> 01:02:35,760
this function as you move
off x equals zero is annex.

920
01:02:36,510 --> 01:02:41,510
So what we're saying then is one plus
x raised to the n is one plus n x plus

921
01:02:44,821 --> 01:02:46,940
tiny numbers.
If x is small,

922
01:02:51,550 --> 01:02:52,840
that is the videos for the zone.

923
01:02:53,830 --> 01:02:56,650
If something looked like one
plus x raised to a power,

924
01:02:57,760 --> 01:03:02,170
and if you're not going too far from
the 0.1, namely Fedex is very small,

925
01:03:02,530 --> 01:03:06,640
then don't bother with doing the whole
one plus x times one plus x and times

926
01:03:06,700 --> 01:03:09,340
it's approximately
equal to one plus annex.

927
01:03:14,090 --> 01:03:14,410
Yes.

928
01:03:14,410 --> 01:03:17,560
So let me give you one example.
You will, we'll use this later on.

929
01:03:22,140 --> 01:03:26,240
According to relativity,
a master for particle

930
01:03:27,770 --> 01:03:28,790
is given by this.

931
01:03:32,100 --> 01:03:36,390
It's a body sitting still. It has
certain mass, Newtonian mechanics.

932
01:03:36,391 --> 01:03:39,150
We say the mass is the mass and
left at the end of the activity.

933
01:03:39,480 --> 01:03:40,890
You don't have to know
the audits in of this.

934
01:03:40,891 --> 01:03:42,540
That will be taught to you in due course,

935
01:03:42,541 --> 01:03:46,170
but it just says particle to the velocity
have a mass different from when they

936
01:03:46,171 --> 01:03:49,590
are at addressed and this is the
velocity and sees the velocity of light.

937
01:03:50,910 --> 01:03:53,610
This is the exact formula.
No,

938
01:03:53,611 --> 01:03:56,580
most of the time you don't care about
it because we oversee maybe 10 to the

939
01:03:56,581 --> 01:03:58,770
minus 10 and a square of that standard.

940
01:03:58,771 --> 01:04:02,700
The minus 20 and one minus certain number
is negligible and be just put it as

941
01:04:02,701 --> 01:04:07,320
one. Suppose you want an answer
that's good too. Some accuracy.

942
01:04:07,650 --> 01:04:08,860
I will write this as follows.

943
01:04:08,861 --> 01:04:13,861
This m zero times one minus B squared
overseas square to the power minus one

944
01:04:15,301 --> 01:04:18,030
half. You agree that's what
a squid or in the bottom is.

945
01:04:18,960 --> 01:04:20,880
It's this power upstairs.

946
01:04:23,520 --> 01:04:25,890
Now we can write it as fall asm zero.

947
01:04:26,640 --> 01:04:29,700
This is one plus x to the N.
Okay,

948
01:04:30,690 --> 01:04:35,690
so the x that we use is minus B squared
overseas square and the end that we use

949
01:04:36,271 --> 01:04:37,290
is minus a half.

950
01:04:40,250 --> 01:04:41,083
Yeah,

951
01:04:42,060 --> 01:04:46,860
that's what I'm using in this formula x
is minus B squared overseas square and

952
01:04:46,861 --> 01:04:50,850
n, which is the power to with
embracing is minus half. Therefore,

953
01:04:50,851 --> 01:04:55,851
this is equal to one plus B squared over
two c square plus corrections with a

954
01:04:56,881 --> 01:04:59,430
negligible if v squared over
c squared is very small.

955
01:05:01,230 --> 01:05:02,700
This is a bit useful result.

956
01:05:03,030 --> 01:05:08,030
It tells you the mass variation is that
it's the mass at rest plus m zero be

957
01:05:10,381 --> 01:05:13,410
square or two squares.
A very useful formula.

958
01:05:13,650 --> 01:05:17,860
Sometimes this formula is much more
friendly to use than the formula.

959
01:05:19,500 --> 01:05:21,930
You cannot beat the exact formula.
It's the exact truth.

960
01:05:22,230 --> 01:05:26,550
But if you're interested in that exact
function for small values of v Oversee,

961
01:05:26,790 --> 01:05:28,980
it's much more useful to
you as this approximation.

962
01:05:30,230 --> 01:05:30,720
Yeah,

963
01:05:30,720 --> 01:05:34,500
and you will have lot of problems like
this in your homework now or later

964
01:05:34,530 --> 01:05:36,960
everywhere else.
So if I'm going to use it all the time,

965
01:05:36,961 --> 01:05:41,730
I should tell you what is this. So let
me summarize what I've told you so far.

966
01:05:41,731 --> 01:05:46,731
First result is if a function is known
at a certain point and you want an orange

967
01:05:47,431 --> 01:05:51,990
value at a nearby point,
what are you supposed to do
that's not so hard to guess,

968
01:05:52,020 --> 01:05:53,070
right?
For example,

969
01:05:53,640 --> 01:05:58,410
their tuition costs are so much this year
at Yale and we know how much is going

970
01:05:58,411 --> 01:06:01,800
up every year. You can make a guess
on what there'll be a year from now.

971
01:06:02,010 --> 01:06:02,371
Of course,

972
01:06:02,371 --> 01:06:05,520
in reality it will be higher than that
because there are these other terms,

973
01:06:06,120 --> 01:06:08,160
but that's the best guests you would make.

974
01:06:08,880 --> 01:06:12,450
That's how we predict the future
by looking at past rates of chains.

975
01:06:12,840 --> 01:06:13,710
That's pretty normal.

976
01:06:14,010 --> 01:06:17,100
The point is that you can predict
the tuition a year from now, maybe,

977
01:06:17,101 --> 01:06:20,940
but maybe not five years from now or 10
years from now because there's inflation

978
01:06:20,941 --> 01:06:21,900
on top of inflation.

979
01:06:22,890 --> 01:06:26,040
That's like saying the rate of
change itself has a rate of change.

980
01:06:26,730 --> 01:06:29,420
The slope here is not
the same as a slope dead.

981
01:06:29,430 --> 01:06:32,430
That's what the higher derivatives
of the function do for you.

982
01:06:33,860 --> 01:06:36,960
So I will conclude by
telling you one last result,

983
01:06:37,260 --> 01:06:41,000
which I'm not going to prove in
this course and you guys should uh,

984
01:06:41,610 --> 01:06:44,250
learn from the math department
the following result.

985
01:06:45,180 --> 01:06:47,220
That is some crazy function.
Okay,

986
01:06:47,430 --> 01:06:52,230
listen ffx I want to know
what it is at the point x,

987
01:06:53,490 --> 01:06:57,780
I know what it is at the origin.
If I know nothing else,

988
01:06:58,050 --> 01:07:00,540
how do I predict the future value of x?
Meaning for other wrecks,

989
01:07:00,550 --> 01:07:02,580
I don't know my best guesses.
Well,

990
01:07:02,581 --> 01:07:04,470
this the number I knew
that's what is going to do,

991
01:07:05,730 --> 01:07:08,580
but if I knew its rate of change here,
you know it's slow slope here.

992
01:07:08,820 --> 01:07:13,820
The next guest is the of it
to of f at the origin time.

993
01:07:13,871 --> 01:07:18,450
Sex. That just what I did earlier.
Instead of Delta X, I'm calling it x.

994
01:07:18,810 --> 01:07:23,700
If x is small enough, it'll work,
but of course x need not be small.

995
01:07:23,760 --> 01:07:27,810
If it gets bigger, it turns out you
can do a little better by adding this

996
01:07:29,430 --> 01:07:34,430
is the second derivative of the
function or the origin times x square

997
01:07:36,040 --> 01:07:39,810
and you can go on adding more and more
terms. I'll just add one more term,

998
01:07:40,260 --> 01:07:44,490
which is three factorial times d cubed,
x f over D,

999
01:07:44,491 --> 01:07:49,320
x cubed times x cubed.
This goes on forever

1000
01:07:52,550 --> 01:07:56,810
and it says that if you knew every deliver
to where the function or the origin,

1001
01:07:57,020 --> 01:08:01,010
you can reconstruct the function,
not just infinitesimally close to it,

1002
01:08:01,490 --> 01:08:05,840
but as far as you want to go that are
some mathematical restrictions on this

1003
01:08:06,140 --> 01:08:08,360
because there are infinite
number of terms in this thing.

1004
01:08:09,260 --> 01:08:12,220
When you add them all up, you may get
infinity, which would be nonsense,

1005
01:08:12,221 --> 01:08:14,360
so he's really sum up this
infinite number of terms.

1006
01:08:14,570 --> 01:08:17,660
If they add to finite
number and if they do that,

1007
01:08:17,661 --> 01:08:18,740
we'll give you the function here.

1008
01:08:19,460 --> 01:08:24,220
What we have done is to just use the first
two terms as an approximation or what

1009
01:08:24,230 --> 01:08:25,031
what I'm telling you,

1010
01:08:25,031 --> 01:08:28,610
there's is something called the Taylor
expansion of a function that allows you

1011
01:08:28,611 --> 01:08:32,060
to know the function.
Even here macroscopically far from here,

1012
01:08:32,510 --> 01:08:37,400
if you knew all the date of it is and if
you put those data natives here and if

1013
01:08:37,401 --> 01:08:39,230
the some added up to something finite,

1014
01:08:39,380 --> 01:08:42,800
that finite thing is the value
of the function or the new point.

1015
01:08:43,340 --> 01:08:48,170
Here's an example.
You guys can take ffx equals e to the x.

1016
01:08:49,460 --> 01:08:54,170
Why don't you go home and work out
the cities for Ffx at all points?

1017
01:08:55,210 --> 01:08:57,970
You've got to remember that either the
x has the beauty that it did have it.

1018
01:08:57,971 --> 01:09:02,530
It was either the exit itself and its
value or the origin of every delivered

1019
01:09:02,610 --> 01:09:03,443
with simply one,

1020
01:09:03,740 --> 01:09:08,510
so this just becomes one plus x
plus x squared over two factorial.

1021
01:09:09,140 --> 01:09:12,080
That is in fact the
expression for these are the x

1022
01:09:13,610 --> 01:09:18,110
and it turns out that no matter how big
xs the some in fact adds up to find that

1023
01:09:18,111 --> 01:09:22,940
number that we call e to the x
in particular. What is he itself?

1024
01:09:23,550 --> 01:09:28,550
He itself is either the one he is
either the one support x equaled one.

1025
01:09:28,821 --> 01:09:33,821
You get one plus one plus one square
over two factorial plus one cubed over

1026
01:09:33,951 --> 01:09:37,910
three factorial. You do all that, you
get two point something, something,

1027
01:09:38,870 --> 01:09:42,860
right? That's e. So this
is a very powerful notion.

1028
01:09:43,760 --> 01:09:46,220
If you knew all the
derivatives of a function,

1029
01:09:47,210 --> 01:09:50,360
you can predict there's value in not only
the tiny neighborhood put over the big

1030
01:09:50,361 --> 01:09:55,340
distance. If you knew the first derivative
and you were not very ambitious,

1031
01:09:55,800 --> 01:09:58,910
look, the logic is very
simple. If x is a tiny number,

1032
01:09:59,120 --> 01:10:01,590
x squared is even Tinier at Xq blood.
Even tiny.

1033
01:10:01,660 --> 01:10:05,600
We got no respect for these terms.
We disrupt them and we stop here.

1034
01:10:08,090 --> 01:10:11,510
Okay, I'll have something more to
say about this later on, but for now,

1035
01:10:11,540 --> 01:10:14,660
these ideas will be useful for
what we're doing next time.
