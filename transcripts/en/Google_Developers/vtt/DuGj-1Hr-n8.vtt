BRIGITTE GOSSELINK:
All right everyone.

00:00:01.624 --> 00:00:04.800
Well, welcome and thanks for
sticking with us through what

00:00:04.800 --> 00:00:06.470
I know has been a
long, hopefully really

00:00:06.470 --> 00:00:09.610
fun, days here at I/O.
I'm Brigitte Gosselink.

00:00:09.610 --> 00:00:12.400
I'm part of the
team at Google.org.

00:00:12.400 --> 00:00:15.750
And yesterday, so as Sundar
was closing the keynote-- so

00:00:15.750 --> 00:00:17.500
be honest how many
people actually made it

00:00:17.500 --> 00:00:19.999
that far through the keynote
and actually heard the closing?

00:00:19.999 --> 00:00:20.960
OK, that's not bad.

00:00:20.960 --> 00:00:22.180
Good job, team.

00:00:22.180 --> 00:00:24.020
If you haven't, I think
it's worth watching,

00:00:24.020 --> 00:00:26.410
as it's relevant to the content
that we have here today.

00:00:26.410 --> 00:00:30.050
He talked about the power of
applying the most cutting edge

00:00:30.050 --> 00:00:33.940
computing that we have to the
world's biggest challenges.

00:00:33.940 --> 00:00:36.310
And at Google.org,
we fund and support

00:00:36.310 --> 00:00:37.940
organizations who
are really working

00:00:37.940 --> 00:00:40.650
to make that promise,
the promise of technology

00:00:40.650 --> 00:00:43.085
to have social
impact, a reality.

00:00:43.085 --> 00:00:45.460
And it was interesting for me
because yesterday's keynote

00:00:45.460 --> 00:00:47.440
actually brought me a
little bit full circle

00:00:47.440 --> 00:00:49.590
back to last year's keynote.

00:00:49.590 --> 00:00:51.850
In last year's keynote
there was a video

00:00:51.850 --> 00:00:55.690
that profiled a man from
Brazil named Carlos,

00:00:55.690 --> 00:00:57.770
who is working on a piece
of assistive technology

00:00:57.770 --> 00:00:59.730
for his daughter.

00:00:59.730 --> 00:01:02.980
And the organizations that
we're working with here today

00:01:02.980 --> 00:01:05.080
that are here to share
their work with you,

00:01:05.080 --> 00:01:07.120
as well as many of
the organizations

00:01:07.120 --> 00:01:08.930
we supported last
year, actually were all

00:01:08.930 --> 00:01:12.160
working to tackle a specific
set of challenges facing people

00:01:12.160 --> 00:01:14.130
with disabilities.

00:01:14.130 --> 00:01:15.900
So first a quick poll.

00:01:15.900 --> 00:01:20.130
How many people here
either identify themselves

00:01:20.130 --> 00:01:23.590
as having a disability
or know someone who does?

00:01:26.920 --> 00:01:28.180
It's a lot of people.

00:01:28.180 --> 00:01:30.250
And in fact, as many
of you probably know,

00:01:30.250 --> 00:01:34.090
one in seven people in the world
have some form of disability.

00:01:34.090 --> 00:01:35.440
That's a billion people.

00:01:35.440 --> 00:01:37.970
It's the world's
largest minority.

00:01:37.970 --> 00:01:40.470
And we know that technology
has the potential

00:01:40.470 --> 00:01:44.160
to help increase independence
and opportunity for people

00:01:44.160 --> 00:01:46.680
with disabilities, for
that billion people.

00:01:46.680 --> 00:01:49.060
Something very exciting
is happening outside.

00:01:49.060 --> 00:01:50.210
GINNY GRANT: And here.

00:01:50.210 --> 00:01:52.120
BRIGITTE GOSSELINK: And
here, which is great.

00:01:52.120 --> 00:01:54.700
So last year at I/O, we
actually announced plans

00:01:54.700 --> 00:01:58.030
to award $20 million in
funding, in Google.org funding

00:01:58.030 --> 00:02:00.930
and support, for
nonprofit organizations

00:02:00.930 --> 00:02:02.690
who are trying to
help push forward

00:02:02.690 --> 00:02:04.450
independence and opportunity.

00:02:04.450 --> 00:02:06.040
We launched an open call.

00:02:06.040 --> 00:02:08.652
And we were really blown
away by the response we got.

00:02:08.652 --> 00:02:13.280
We had more than 1,000
applications from 88 countries.

00:02:13.280 --> 00:02:15.710
One of those applications
was from Carlos.

00:02:15.710 --> 00:02:20.147
And Carlos actually proposed to
use natural language processing

00:02:20.147 --> 00:02:22.730
and context-- a couple things
we heard a little bit about here

00:02:22.730 --> 00:02:26.327
so far at I/O-- to improve
the assistive communication

00:02:26.327 --> 00:02:28.660
software that he was building
so that his daughter could

00:02:28.660 --> 00:02:29.720
communicate.

00:02:29.720 --> 00:02:31.490
She has communication
limitations,

00:02:31.490 --> 00:02:33.220
as someone with cerebral palsy.

00:02:33.220 --> 00:02:35.470
And so for example,
he wanted the software

00:02:35.470 --> 00:02:38.310
to be able to, in the
morning when she wakes up,

00:02:38.310 --> 00:02:41.250
suggest on her picture
board breakfast items,

00:02:41.250 --> 00:02:43.139
because it knows
that she's at home.

00:02:43.139 --> 00:02:45.180
And she knows in the
morning she wants breakfast.

00:02:45.180 --> 00:02:46.655
She shouldn't have
to navigate in

00:02:46.655 --> 00:02:48.880
to find these
through several menus

00:02:48.880 --> 00:02:50.390
to find these
options, so that she

00:02:50.390 --> 00:02:52.624
can say that she wants oatmeal.

00:02:52.624 --> 00:02:54.290
So it was really
exciting for me to hear

00:02:54.290 --> 00:02:57.630
Sundar talking about the
promise of those practices.

00:02:57.630 --> 00:03:00.912
And we're excited to be
funding Carlos to do that work.

00:03:00.912 --> 00:03:02.370
And actually what
he'll be building

00:03:02.370 --> 00:03:05.600
will all be open source, so
that other assistive devices

00:03:05.600 --> 00:03:08.060
and software can hopefully
benefit from the same work

00:03:08.060 --> 00:03:10.370
that he's using.

00:03:10.370 --> 00:03:13.500
And I'm thrilled to have here
today four other organizations

00:03:13.500 --> 00:03:17.090
who won funding through that
challenge, who are all working

00:03:17.090 --> 00:03:18.750
on really hard problems.

00:03:18.750 --> 00:03:21.250
If you want to check out any
of the other projects and ideas

00:03:21.250 --> 00:03:23.260
that we funded,
they're all available.

00:03:23.260 --> 00:03:26.900
You can check them out
at g.co/disabilities.

00:03:26.900 --> 00:03:29.406
So with that, I will turn
it over to the panelists

00:03:29.406 --> 00:03:31.530
to introduce themselves,
tell you a little bit more

00:03:31.530 --> 00:03:32.540
about their work.

00:03:32.540 --> 00:03:35.450
They'll talk about who they
are as people, technologists

00:03:35.450 --> 00:03:36.980
working on social challenges.

00:03:36.980 --> 00:03:38.970
Hopefully that's
interesting to some of you.

00:03:38.970 --> 00:03:40.530
And what the problem
is that they're

00:03:40.530 --> 00:03:42.484
working on, as well
as their approach

00:03:42.484 --> 00:03:43.900
to trying to solve
that challenge.

00:03:43.900 --> 00:03:45.460
Arnon, you want to start us off?

00:03:45.460 --> 00:03:46.560
ARNON ZAMIR: Sure.

00:03:46.560 --> 00:03:49.950
Hi everybody, very
excited to be here.

00:03:49.950 --> 00:03:50.930
My name is Arnon Zamir.

00:03:50.930 --> 00:03:54.910
I come from Tel Aviv, where I
run an organization named TOM.

00:03:54.910 --> 00:03:58.270
That's T-O-M. Myself,
I'm a software

00:03:58.270 --> 00:04:02.530
developer by profession and
by occupational history.

00:04:02.530 --> 00:04:05.620
But in the last
three years or so,

00:04:05.620 --> 00:04:10.700
I've been running social
technology involved projects.

00:04:10.700 --> 00:04:14.730
The crown jewel of those is TOM.

00:04:14.730 --> 00:04:18.990
What we do with TOM is
create an umbrella system

00:04:18.990 --> 00:04:22.260
for technologies to be involved
in assisting and empowering

00:04:22.260 --> 00:04:24.210
people with disabilities.

00:04:24.210 --> 00:04:26.950
We're looking for
challenges that

00:04:26.950 --> 00:04:30.150
can-- and therefore should--
be addressed by technology.

00:04:30.150 --> 00:04:32.750
And we're looking for two
cases, two main cases.

00:04:32.750 --> 00:04:36.720
Either where a solution for
a challenge does not exist,

00:04:36.720 --> 00:04:38.710
or where a solution
exists, but it is not

00:04:38.710 --> 00:04:42.670
affordable to many people,
due to either propriety

00:04:42.670 --> 00:04:47.360
rights on the design or other
reasons, usually customization,

00:04:47.360 --> 00:04:49.840
which makes products
very expensive.

00:04:49.840 --> 00:04:53.310
We are looking for
technology makers that

00:04:53.310 --> 00:04:56.860
are willing to put some time
into development of solutions,

00:04:56.860 --> 00:04:59.895
and then people with
disabilities and experts, which

00:04:59.895 --> 00:05:03.610
we call need knowers, those
that can describe the need.

00:05:03.610 --> 00:05:05.670
And we facilitate the
meeting of the two.

00:05:05.670 --> 00:05:08.420
We're creating very high end,
very complicated make-a-thons,

00:05:08.420 --> 00:05:11.700
marathons of makers; and then
taking the products of those

00:05:11.700 --> 00:05:13.620
into continuous
development products, which

00:05:13.620 --> 00:05:15.080
we call developer groups.

00:05:15.080 --> 00:05:18.410
And finally with the generous
assistance of Google.org,

00:05:18.410 --> 00:05:20.260
we're able to create
a web platform that

00:05:20.260 --> 00:05:23.580
helps all of those take
a path to market, again,

00:05:23.580 --> 00:05:27.060
as a nonprofit organization
on an open source

00:05:27.060 --> 00:05:31.610
version of everything that
we requires and develop.

00:05:31.610 --> 00:05:33.770
That's the one liner.

00:05:33.770 --> 00:05:35.475
A long line.

00:05:35.475 --> 00:05:36.850
BRIGITTE GOSSELINK:
Great, Ginny?

00:05:36.850 --> 00:05:38.224
GINNY GRANT: Hi,
I'm Ginny Grant.

00:05:38.224 --> 00:05:40.520
I'm a senior product
manager at Benetech.

00:05:40.520 --> 00:05:44.300
And in my history, I've been
a technologist for many years.

00:05:44.300 --> 00:05:47.920
I was also a classroom
teacher and volunteer.

00:05:47.920 --> 00:05:50.840
And when I came to Benetech
about 4 and 1/2 years ago,

00:05:50.840 --> 00:05:52.460
I found my calling,
because Benetech

00:05:52.460 --> 00:05:57.000
is a completely different
kind of technology company.

00:05:57.000 --> 00:05:59.160
Like you, we look
for opportunities

00:05:59.160 --> 00:06:02.590
where we can serve communities
that otherwise are not

00:06:02.590 --> 00:06:06.340
as well served, whether it's
in an environmental sense.

00:06:06.340 --> 00:06:10.460
We have tools which allow
conservationists to report

00:06:10.460 --> 00:06:12.260
issues with their ecosystem.

00:06:12.260 --> 00:06:15.570
We also have secure tools that
our human rights advocates are

00:06:15.570 --> 00:06:18.520
able to use to
report human rights

00:06:18.520 --> 00:06:20.410
violations around the world.

00:06:20.410 --> 00:06:22.830
And then in the group
that I'm most focused on,

00:06:22.830 --> 00:06:27.540
our global literacy team, we
serve over 400,000 members

00:06:27.540 --> 00:06:30.430
who are able to get our
books in an accessible

00:06:30.430 --> 00:06:32.510
format for their
needs, whether it's

00:06:32.510 --> 00:06:34.450
because they have
a vision impairment

00:06:34.450 --> 00:06:37.560
or they've lost
the use of a limb.

00:06:37.560 --> 00:06:39.060
Perhaps whether
it's cerebal palsy,

00:06:39.060 --> 00:06:41.580
or they've served their
country and have lost an arm,

00:06:41.580 --> 00:06:44.950
had a stroke, or they also
have a learning difference,

00:06:44.950 --> 00:06:48.650
a disability such as dyslexia
that causes the words not

00:06:48.650 --> 00:06:50.920
to form properly
unless they're served

00:06:50.920 --> 00:06:55.004
in multimodal, both visual and
auditorily, and highlighted.

00:06:55.004 --> 00:06:56.420
So it's really
exciting that we're

00:06:56.420 --> 00:06:58.440
able to bring those
kind of technologies

00:06:58.440 --> 00:06:59.940
to people around the world.

00:06:59.940 --> 00:07:02.740
And I'll be talking more
later about the details

00:07:02.740 --> 00:07:05.514
of how we're doing that.

00:07:05.514 --> 00:07:07.280
BRIGITTE GOSSELINK:
Go ahead, Holger.

00:07:07.280 --> 00:07:09.660
HOLGER DIETERICH: Hello,
my name is Holger.

00:07:09.660 --> 00:07:11.750
I am the co-founder
of wheelmap.org.

00:07:11.750 --> 00:07:15.240
My background is in-- I have
a degree in design and work

00:07:15.240 --> 00:07:17.380
in product management a lot.

00:07:17.380 --> 00:07:21.220
The problem I found with
my best friend, Raul,

00:07:21.220 --> 00:07:22.910
who was using
electric wheelchair,

00:07:22.910 --> 00:07:26.440
is where can we actually
hang out and have a coffee,

00:07:26.440 --> 00:07:29.160
go to a bar, mundane things?

00:07:29.160 --> 00:07:34.270
And we think that inclusion
means that everybody should

00:07:34.270 --> 00:07:37.030
take part in daily life
equally, no matter if they

00:07:37.030 --> 00:07:38.600
have a disability or not.

00:07:38.600 --> 00:07:40.970
So what I figured out
was why do we always

00:07:40.970 --> 00:07:43.297
go to the cafe in your area?

00:07:43.297 --> 00:07:44.880
Why don't you come
to my neighborhood?

00:07:44.880 --> 00:07:46.850
So we're from Berlin, Germany.

00:07:46.850 --> 00:07:48.427
And we have lots
of old buildings.

00:07:48.427 --> 00:07:51.010
And what I didn't know before
is that a lot of these buildings

00:07:51.010 --> 00:07:54.180
have steps in the entrance so
you cannot get in when you have

00:07:54.180 --> 00:07:55.690
an electric wheelchair.

00:07:55.690 --> 00:07:57.750
So he said, you know,
I don't know where

00:07:57.750 --> 00:07:59.550
I can get in your neighborhood.

00:07:59.550 --> 00:08:04.720
Like yeah, but you cannot be the
only wheelchair user in Berlin

00:08:04.720 --> 00:08:05.720
or in this neighborhood.

00:08:05.720 --> 00:08:08.900
So what about building
an app where everybody

00:08:08.900 --> 00:08:13.300
can look around and mark
places, physical places

00:08:13.300 --> 00:08:17.620
like restaurants, cafes,
anything, any public places

00:08:17.620 --> 00:08:20.120
and say yes, they are
wheelchair accessible or no,

00:08:20.120 --> 00:08:21.920
they are not
wheelchair accessible.

00:08:21.920 --> 00:08:26.700
So we built that five years ago.

00:08:26.700 --> 00:08:28.270
And it's now the
largest data set

00:08:28.270 --> 00:08:31.380
in the world with more
than 650,000 marked places.

00:08:31.380 --> 00:08:33.840
And we're online
in 22 languages.

00:08:33.840 --> 00:08:37.120
So what we do know
now is that we

00:08:37.120 --> 00:08:42.260
want to bring this to
other location based

00:08:42.260 --> 00:08:45.916
services and maps apps,
so that they can augment

00:08:45.916 --> 00:08:48.290
their service with wheelchair
accessibility, but not only

00:08:48.290 --> 00:08:50.550
our sources, but from
other nonprofits,

00:08:50.550 --> 00:08:53.330
from other data sources as well.

00:08:53.330 --> 00:08:54.656
So that's for me.

00:08:54.656 --> 00:08:56.072
BRIGITTE GOSSELINK:
Go ahead, Ume.

00:08:56.072 --> 00:08:56.954
UMESH PANDYA: Hi all.

00:08:56.954 --> 00:09:00.930
I'm Ume, or my full
name is Umesh Pandya.

00:09:00.930 --> 00:09:04.170
I have been a
designer for 15 years.

00:09:04.170 --> 00:09:05.550
And we work out of London.

00:09:05.550 --> 00:09:08.080
And I look after an
organization called Wayfindr.

00:09:08.080 --> 00:09:09.960
And Wayfindr's
mission is to empower

00:09:09.960 --> 00:09:12.150
vision impaired people
to independently navigate

00:09:12.150 --> 00:09:12.650
the world.

00:09:12.650 --> 00:09:14.480
And that's our sole existence.

00:09:14.480 --> 00:09:16.950
That's what we do
day in, day out.

00:09:16.950 --> 00:09:19.750
Now what we do will be
quite specific here,

00:09:19.750 --> 00:09:21.800
is that we do not create an app.

00:09:21.800 --> 00:09:25.320
We're creating an open standard
for audio based way finding.

00:09:25.320 --> 00:09:27.270
And what that
allows people to do

00:09:27.270 --> 00:09:30.720
is it allows venue owners,
such as transport networks,

00:09:30.720 --> 00:09:34.140
and retailers, and
navigation app developers,

00:09:34.140 --> 00:09:36.602
to have a common
language together.

00:09:36.602 --> 00:09:38.560
So they can look at the
standard and understand

00:09:38.560 --> 00:09:41.400
how they might make their
space accessible for indoor

00:09:41.400 --> 00:09:42.950
navigation for blind people.

00:09:42.950 --> 00:09:44.950
Now, currently we're using BLE.

00:09:44.950 --> 00:09:46.880
So we're using Bluetooth
beacons to allow turn

00:09:46.880 --> 00:09:48.084
by turn navigation.

00:09:48.084 --> 00:09:49.750
An example of that
is some installations

00:09:49.750 --> 00:09:50.833
that we've done in London.

00:09:50.833 --> 00:09:53.110
And we've done some
installations over in Sydney.

00:09:53.110 --> 00:09:56.220
And that tells the user
walk straight or turn right

00:09:56.220 --> 00:09:57.337
or go down an escalator.

00:09:57.337 --> 00:09:59.170
And all of these
instructions and guidelines

00:09:59.170 --> 00:10:02.640
are baked into the guidelines
that we published last week,

00:10:02.640 --> 00:10:04.644
in the open standard.

00:10:04.644 --> 00:10:05.810
BRIGITTE GOSSELINK: Perfect.

00:10:05.810 --> 00:10:08.390
Well thanks so much for
those overviews, all.

00:10:08.390 --> 00:10:10.580
I think I'd like to
start with a discussion

00:10:10.580 --> 00:10:12.870
about inclusive
design in general.

00:10:12.870 --> 00:10:15.800
And in specific, how we can
think about technology really

00:10:15.800 --> 00:10:19.260
being part of the answer
for some of the challenges

00:10:19.260 --> 00:10:21.320
that face people
with disabilities.

00:10:21.320 --> 00:10:23.450
And obviously, that's the
core of what you all do.

00:10:23.450 --> 00:10:24.960
But I thought it would be
useful for this audience

00:10:24.960 --> 00:10:27.270
to perhaps give a little
bit more of the advice

00:10:27.270 --> 00:10:30.360
that you would have, for
really designing with this user

00:10:30.360 --> 00:10:32.092
population in mind.

00:10:32.092 --> 00:10:33.550
Ginny, do you want
to start us off?

00:10:33.550 --> 00:10:34.750
GINNY GRANT: All right.

00:10:34.750 --> 00:10:36.250
So a number of things.

00:10:36.250 --> 00:10:38.240
The first thing
off is start early.

00:10:38.240 --> 00:10:41.570
Think about accessibility
as soon as you can.

00:10:41.570 --> 00:10:42.910
Write with usability.

00:10:42.910 --> 00:10:45.070
You never want to
bake it back in later.

00:10:45.070 --> 00:10:46.700
You can't change
the ingredients.

00:10:46.700 --> 00:10:48.640
It's so much better
to start upfront.

00:10:48.640 --> 00:10:51.525
So look for all the
design standards.

00:10:51.525 --> 00:10:52.900
And I know other
people are going

00:10:52.900 --> 00:10:56.520
be talking about this too,
but thinking about the-- POUR

00:10:56.520 --> 00:10:58.190
I believe is a good acronym.

00:10:58.190 --> 00:11:00.150
The P-O-U-R. So go look that up.

00:11:00.150 --> 00:11:02.230
Google that.

00:11:02.230 --> 00:11:06.760
But making sure that every
illustration or image that's

00:11:06.760 --> 00:11:12.470
on your web page or in your
tool is accessible to all.

00:11:12.470 --> 00:11:14.370
Turn off the volume.

00:11:14.370 --> 00:11:15.900
Turn down the monitor.

00:11:15.900 --> 00:11:20.840
Or even try to use an oven
mitt to try to navigate.

00:11:20.840 --> 00:11:23.000
If you had to use a
switch, and you just

00:11:23.000 --> 00:11:25.010
needed to be able
to move around,

00:11:25.010 --> 00:11:28.480
you can't assume that people
have all the dexterity

00:11:28.480 --> 00:11:30.010
that some others do.

00:11:30.010 --> 00:11:33.830
So work that in from
the very get go.

00:11:33.830 --> 00:11:35.270
There's a lot of other things.

00:11:35.270 --> 00:11:36.603
But also work through standards.

00:11:36.603 --> 00:11:38.080
Ume, you mentioned that earlier.

00:11:38.080 --> 00:11:41.640
Try to improve the standard
so that more people

00:11:41.640 --> 00:11:47.959
can spread that capability of
technology that is accessible.

00:11:47.959 --> 00:11:49.500
I think that's a
good starting point.

00:11:49.500 --> 00:11:50.750
BRIGITTE GOSSELINK:
Yeah, definitely.

00:11:50.750 --> 00:11:51.630
Arnon, do you want
to add anything?

00:11:51.630 --> 00:11:53.700
ARNON ZAMIR: I'd like
to tap into that.

00:11:53.700 --> 00:11:57.630
And that's a very
important part of creating

00:11:57.630 --> 00:12:01.340
anything inclusive and
anything accessible

00:12:01.340 --> 00:12:05.120
is being in a constant dialogue
with the people that need it.

00:12:05.120 --> 00:12:09.500
One of the principles,
which is articulated

00:12:09.500 --> 00:12:17.600
in the saying from Holger,
"nothing about us without us."

00:12:17.600 --> 00:12:19.130
Don't do anything for someone.

00:12:19.130 --> 00:12:21.080
Always do with someone.

00:12:21.080 --> 00:12:25.460
When we work at TOM, we define
our goal and our methodology

00:12:25.460 --> 00:12:29.930
as facilitating the meeting
points of challenge and talent.

00:12:29.930 --> 00:12:32.850
We bring people that can
donate some of their time,

00:12:32.850 --> 00:12:35.750
and we sit them in the same
room and the same table

00:12:35.750 --> 00:12:38.200
with the people that can
understand the challenge.

00:12:38.200 --> 00:12:41.840
So imagine that you were
developing a productivity

00:12:41.840 --> 00:12:44.880
app for young mothers.

00:12:44.880 --> 00:12:48.910
First thing you would have
done is go meet young mothers

00:12:48.910 --> 00:12:51.660
and analyze their
productivity challenges.

00:12:51.660 --> 00:12:56.310
That's obvious for every
development team working

00:12:56.310 --> 00:12:57.870
on designing their new app.

00:12:57.870 --> 00:13:00.270
The same thing is true with
anything from wheelchair

00:13:00.270 --> 00:13:03.270
accessibility, to
visual impairment aids,

00:13:03.270 --> 00:13:06.960
to applications for
people with disabilities.

00:13:06.960 --> 00:13:11.920
Just have your client,
the need knower, with you.

00:13:11.920 --> 00:13:16.010
And another small angle on
that is that accessibility

00:13:16.010 --> 00:13:16.700
is one thing.

00:13:16.700 --> 00:13:19.390
Design your application to
be accessible for people

00:13:19.390 --> 00:13:21.800
with certain limitations.

00:13:21.800 --> 00:13:26.000
Another angle can be when you're
meeting with a new technology,

00:13:26.000 --> 00:13:29.240
or when you're creating
a new technology, one

00:13:29.240 --> 00:13:31.580
of the things we found
out, some people right away

00:13:31.580 --> 00:13:34.260
think, what can
this technology do

00:13:34.260 --> 00:13:35.960
for people with disabilities?

00:13:35.960 --> 00:13:41.230
So if we have a new
visual design theme,

00:13:41.230 --> 00:13:43.890
or if we have a
contextual engine,

00:13:43.890 --> 00:13:48.580
or if we have anything new
happening in the big technology

00:13:48.580 --> 00:13:50.930
world, right away we
think, how can this

00:13:50.930 --> 00:13:54.260
be put in use for people
with disabilities.

00:13:54.260 --> 00:13:56.680
There is no
advancement today that

00:13:56.680 --> 00:14:00.017
is not tied with technology,
and this is not an exception.

00:14:00.017 --> 00:14:01.100
BRIGITTE GOSSELINK: Right.

00:14:01.100 --> 00:14:03.580
Really building in
as a use case and not

00:14:03.580 --> 00:14:05.730
as an add-on or
something that you

00:14:05.730 --> 00:14:08.230
might need a whole different
piece of software for,

00:14:08.230 --> 00:14:09.660
a different device.

00:14:09.660 --> 00:14:12.050
I think that really speaks
to that inclusive nature.

00:14:12.050 --> 00:14:14.870
I think for people who maybe
feel uncertain about how

00:14:14.870 --> 00:14:17.810
to get close to those
user needs, which I think

00:14:17.810 --> 00:14:19.530
can sometimes feel
like a barrier

00:14:19.530 --> 00:14:22.930
when you're trying to develop
solutions in this space, what

00:14:22.930 --> 00:14:26.190
advice would you all have for
the best way to get close,

00:14:26.190 --> 00:14:28.186
get proximate to those needs?

00:14:28.186 --> 00:14:31.392
Holger, did you want to take it?

00:14:31.392 --> 00:14:32.600
HOLGER DIETERICH: Me, or you?

00:14:32.600 --> 00:14:33.725
You want to start?

00:14:33.725 --> 00:14:35.956
UMESH PANDYA: I can go.

00:14:35.956 --> 00:14:38.430
With the way that
we do it, day in,

00:14:38.430 --> 00:14:42.390
day out is we use a methodology
called build, measure, learn.

00:14:42.390 --> 00:14:46.210
And we also use user centered
design in everything we do.

00:14:46.210 --> 00:14:49.190
So for example, in some of
the stations that we've done,

00:14:49.190 --> 00:14:51.282
we've worked with
users over three weeks.

00:14:51.282 --> 00:14:53.240
So every station we've
done, every installation

00:14:53.240 --> 00:14:54.570
we've done, 25 users.

00:14:54.570 --> 00:14:55.630
We bring them in.

00:14:55.630 --> 00:14:57.280
We test with them one to one.

00:14:57.280 --> 00:14:58.690
We iterate.

00:14:58.690 --> 00:15:01.040
That means that we get five
iterations of our products

00:15:01.040 --> 00:15:01.820
in one day.

00:15:01.820 --> 00:15:02.950
That's pretty amazing.

00:15:02.950 --> 00:15:04.040
Over the course of
three weeks, we've

00:15:04.040 --> 00:15:05.331
got something that's validated.

00:15:05.331 --> 00:15:07.540
All of that information gets
pushed up into standard.

00:15:07.540 --> 00:15:09.372
And then we have an
awesome backlog of stuff

00:15:09.372 --> 00:15:11.760
that we need to attack in our
next round of user testing.

00:15:11.760 --> 00:15:15.570
So having users at the
center is really useful.

00:15:15.570 --> 00:15:19.064
Prototyping is a really good way
to manage uncertainty as well.

00:15:19.064 --> 00:15:20.480
So if you're
developing something,

00:15:20.480 --> 00:15:23.250
and you're kind of unsure--
am I doing the right thing?

00:15:23.250 --> 00:15:24.690
Or should I be
doing it this way?

00:15:24.690 --> 00:15:26.220
Just get the users in the room.

00:15:26.220 --> 00:15:28.260
Try and hunt out
the actual people

00:15:28.260 --> 00:15:30.810
that have the needs that
you can help support.

00:15:30.810 --> 00:15:34.061
If you can't get access to
them, try and find experts

00:15:34.061 --> 00:15:35.060
that can help with that.

00:15:35.060 --> 00:15:36.560
And then just work with them.

00:15:36.560 --> 00:15:39.370
And the core thing is just
bake them into your process

00:15:39.370 --> 00:15:41.710
and bake them into your
organization and how you do it.

00:15:41.710 --> 00:15:42.910
You can't do it at a distance.

00:15:42.910 --> 00:15:44.743
It's really difficult.
You have to have them

00:15:44.743 --> 00:15:46.699
with you at all times.

00:15:46.699 --> 00:15:48.990
BRIGITTE GOSSELINK: Yeah, I
mean I think Holger's story

00:15:48.990 --> 00:15:51.910
with founding the organization
that he founded with Raul

00:15:51.910 --> 00:15:54.610
is obviously the most
visceral way that you

00:15:54.610 --> 00:15:55.690
can imagine doing that.

00:15:55.690 --> 00:15:58.344
Just hire someone and
have them on your staff.

00:15:58.344 --> 00:16:00.510
But if you can't do that,
I think some of the things

00:16:00.510 --> 00:16:03.490
that you suggested,
Ume, are quite useful.

00:16:03.490 --> 00:16:06.730
We also mentioned this
idea of experimentation.

00:16:06.730 --> 00:16:09.040
And this is actually,
beyond this space, something

00:16:09.040 --> 00:16:12.340
that I think is interesting
in the social impact

00:16:12.340 --> 00:16:13.310
sector in general.

00:16:13.310 --> 00:16:15.510
So we actually
don't think a lot,

00:16:15.510 --> 00:16:17.500
in the same way that
we talk about launching

00:16:17.500 --> 00:16:21.380
an iterate in Google and in
many of the technology that we

00:16:21.380 --> 00:16:22.190
build.

00:16:22.190 --> 00:16:23.965
We don't think as much
about it, I think,

00:16:23.965 --> 00:16:25.840
sometimes when it comes
to social challenges.

00:16:25.840 --> 00:16:27.256
And that's because
there are some,

00:16:27.256 --> 00:16:28.586
I think, real barriers to that.

00:16:28.586 --> 00:16:30.710
It's something that we
really encourage in the work

00:16:30.710 --> 00:16:32.160
that we support and fund.

00:16:32.160 --> 00:16:34.760
And a lot of the groups
that are represented here

00:16:34.760 --> 00:16:35.794
are trying to do that.

00:16:35.794 --> 00:16:37.960
I wonder if you all could
just give some reflections

00:16:37.960 --> 00:16:40.580
on some of the difficulties
and barriers to doing

00:16:40.580 --> 00:16:43.550
that well, given that you're
trying to, with your work,

00:16:43.550 --> 00:16:46.084
also have great social impact.

00:16:46.084 --> 00:16:48.000
HOLGER DIETERICH: Maybe
I can give an example.

00:16:48.000 --> 00:16:51.720
So there were other
nonprofit organizations

00:16:51.720 --> 00:16:54.260
who tried to do what
we did, for finding

00:16:54.260 --> 00:16:56.640
wheelchair accessible places.

00:16:56.640 --> 00:17:00.170
And they're experts in their
needs, as we said before.

00:17:00.170 --> 00:17:02.300
But they're not experts
in building Android apps,

00:17:02.300 --> 00:17:05.859
for example, or web
apps or making it scale.

00:17:05.859 --> 00:17:10.280
So our data set is based
on open street map.

00:17:10.280 --> 00:17:11.810
So you have to know this access.

00:17:11.810 --> 00:17:14.589
You have to be able
to access the APIs

00:17:14.589 --> 00:17:16.770
and to build around
it, make it stable,

00:17:16.770 --> 00:17:19.710
maybe interact with others
and have a good design.

00:17:19.710 --> 00:17:21.650
So I think where
things come together

00:17:21.650 --> 00:17:24.310
is also to learn
from each other,

00:17:24.310 --> 00:17:27.859
so that you as an expert
in software development

00:17:27.859 --> 00:17:30.200
have a beginners
mindset in learning

00:17:30.200 --> 00:17:33.120
about people with
disabilities and vice versa.

00:17:33.120 --> 00:17:36.000
So I think there's
always something people

00:17:36.000 --> 00:17:38.244
can help each other with.

00:17:38.244 --> 00:17:39.660
BRIGITTE GOSSELINK:
Yeah, Ume, did

00:17:39.660 --> 00:17:41.124
you have anything to add there?

00:17:41.124 --> 00:17:43.290
UMESH PANDYA: What we've
learned along the journey--

00:17:43.290 --> 00:17:45.780
because we're a joint venture
between a digital product

00:17:45.780 --> 00:17:51.870
studio and a charity.

00:17:51.870 --> 00:17:55.560
So it's a joint venture between
us two and the Royal London

00:17:55.560 --> 00:17:56.810
Society for Blind People.

00:17:56.810 --> 00:17:58.450
We're finding we're
learning both ways.

00:17:58.450 --> 00:18:02.330
So to Holger's point, we're
bringing digital product,

00:18:02.330 --> 00:18:03.790
design process and all that in.

00:18:03.790 --> 00:18:05.810
But what the RLSB are
helping us understand

00:18:05.810 --> 00:18:07.719
is the user and
the social impact.

00:18:07.719 --> 00:18:10.010
So when we talk about measure
in build, measure, learn,

00:18:10.010 --> 00:18:12.082
it gets expanded a little bit.

00:18:12.082 --> 00:18:14.290
So when you talk about
measure in the design context,

00:18:14.290 --> 00:18:16.950
we can measure usability,
whether the instructions are

00:18:16.950 --> 00:18:18.990
correct, how many
people are using it,

00:18:18.990 --> 00:18:20.570
regular stuff like that.

00:18:20.570 --> 00:18:25.980
However if you're talking about
measurement in a social impact

00:18:25.980 --> 00:18:27.890
space, is that
how do you measure

00:18:27.890 --> 00:18:29.790
how someone felt
before they used

00:18:29.790 --> 00:18:31.460
the Wayfindr-enabled system?

00:18:31.460 --> 00:18:32.720
How do they feel after it?

00:18:32.720 --> 00:18:35.910
Have we moved them along that
journey to a better well-being?

00:18:35.910 --> 00:18:38.320
These are interesting
challenges that take us out

00:18:38.320 --> 00:18:41.260
of the product space and more
into a social impact space.

00:18:41.260 --> 00:18:42.840
And these are
exciting times for us,

00:18:42.840 --> 00:18:45.027
when we start to
unpack these things.

00:18:45.027 --> 00:18:47.360
BRIGITTE GOSSELINK: I don't
know if people on Livestream

00:18:47.360 --> 00:18:49.480
can hear the cheering that's
happening outside this tent.

00:18:49.480 --> 00:18:51.521
But this is apparently a
very popular discussion.

00:18:51.521 --> 00:18:53.877
Getting a lot of
support right now.

00:18:53.877 --> 00:18:55.460
GINNY GRANT: I'd
love to add another--

00:18:55.460 --> 00:18:56.230
BRIGITTE GOSSELINK: I
was going to say, Ginny,

00:18:56.230 --> 00:18:57.485
I think that you all have
some great experience

00:18:57.485 --> 00:18:58.799
for this idea of iterating.

00:18:58.799 --> 00:19:01.340
GINNY GRANT: Well, so Bookshare
and Benetech have been around

00:19:01.340 --> 00:19:04.020
actually for about 12
years, before the Kindle

00:19:04.020 --> 00:19:05.620
and those other
electronic books,

00:19:05.620 --> 00:19:08.490
when we first started to
make books available online.

00:19:08.490 --> 00:19:10.950
And our whole mantra
was about making

00:19:10.950 --> 00:19:13.530
books accessible in the
digital format that they need

00:19:13.530 --> 00:19:15.612
and people can get
it through the web.

00:19:15.612 --> 00:19:17.320
And then we've been
starting-- especially

00:19:17.320 --> 00:19:21.640
as we've been expanding out
to other countries and places

00:19:21.640 --> 00:19:24.510
that aren't as
economically affluent.

00:19:24.510 --> 00:19:27.880
And it's been fascinating to
see old technology that still

00:19:27.880 --> 00:19:30.110
has IE6 embedded right in it.

00:19:30.110 --> 00:19:32.860
And how do we work with that?

00:19:32.860 --> 00:19:35.140
Or places that--
well now they're

00:19:35.140 --> 00:19:37.340
actually putting their
library books on CDs

00:19:37.340 --> 00:19:40.850
and sending them out through
the postal service every month

00:19:40.850 --> 00:19:41.750
to their patrons.

00:19:41.750 --> 00:19:46.530
And we're trying to change,
socially, the cultural as well

00:19:46.530 --> 00:19:47.740
as technology.

00:19:47.740 --> 00:19:50.610
So we're definitely
hitting constraints

00:19:50.610 --> 00:19:55.020
where people who may not be
as economically advantaged

00:19:55.020 --> 00:19:58.380
can't switch out technology
as fast as we here,

00:19:58.380 --> 00:20:00.540
especially in this
wonderful Silicon Valley,

00:20:00.540 --> 00:20:01.920
think it can happen.

00:20:01.920 --> 00:20:04.830
But we're trying to make
those strides to get people

00:20:04.830 --> 00:20:08.190
to that point-- again,
working with and not for.

00:20:08.190 --> 00:20:10.515
So that's been an
interesting challenge.

00:20:10.515 --> 00:20:12.639
BRIGITTE GOSSELINK: What
are some of the strategies

00:20:12.639 --> 00:20:14.500
that you've taken to
try to deal with that?

00:20:14.500 --> 00:20:16.160
Obviously some of it is
updating your software

00:20:16.160 --> 00:20:17.368
to work all the way back IE6.

00:20:17.368 --> 00:20:18.710
So congratulations to you.

00:20:18.710 --> 00:20:20.710
GINNY GRANT: Well and on
that note, we actually,

00:20:20.710 --> 00:20:24.042
last November, had to finally
cut the umbilical cord there.

00:20:24.042 --> 00:20:26.250
BRIGITTE GOSSELINK: I think
they're now at 8, though.

00:20:26.250 --> 00:20:28.030
ARNON ZAMIR: I'm sorry.

00:20:28.030 --> 00:20:30.390
GINNY GRANT: So they're
out of the nest now.

00:20:30.390 --> 00:20:32.210
But they have other
ways of doing it.

00:20:32.210 --> 00:20:33.710
Unfortunately there
were some people

00:20:33.710 --> 00:20:35.440
who were still so accustomed.

00:20:35.440 --> 00:20:37.910
And some of it is
comfort levels,

00:20:37.910 --> 00:20:40.062
because people have
become accustomed to doing

00:20:40.062 --> 00:20:41.770
things the way they've
been doing things.

00:20:41.770 --> 00:20:46.300
And so it's been an interesting
journey to work with people.

00:20:46.300 --> 00:20:49.360
And again, baby steps of getting
people to try something out,

00:20:49.360 --> 00:20:50.280
feel comfortable.

00:20:50.280 --> 00:20:52.630
I love the idea of not
just looking at metrics

00:20:52.630 --> 00:20:55.910
from a purely
objective perspective,

00:20:55.910 --> 00:20:57.790
but that subjective
nature as well.

00:20:57.790 --> 00:20:59.650
It's really cool.

00:20:59.650 --> 00:21:02.170
So I guess that's some of
it is that we're also--

00:21:02.170 --> 00:21:04.940
we work with open
source as well so

00:21:04.940 --> 00:21:07.780
that we want to make sure that
other people can use pieces

00:21:07.780 --> 00:21:10.500
that we build out.

00:21:10.500 --> 00:21:12.350
The math-- we have
a MathML cloud

00:21:12.350 --> 00:21:14.130
that we're evolving
that people will

00:21:14.130 --> 00:21:17.570
be able to help
expand and then use

00:21:17.570 --> 00:21:20.842
the MathML that's there in that
repository to reference that.

00:21:20.842 --> 00:21:22.550
BRIGITTE GOSSELINK:
What's MathML, Ginny?

00:21:22.550 --> 00:21:22.720
GINNY GRANT: Sorry

00:21:22.720 --> 00:21:24.178
BRIGITTE GOSSELINK:
What is MathML?

00:21:24.178 --> 00:21:26.260
GINNY GRANT: Oh
MathML, so sorry.

00:21:26.260 --> 00:21:28.760
So imagine that you're
looking at a textbook that

00:21:28.760 --> 00:21:32.280
has a cool equation
that's all laid out there.

00:21:32.280 --> 00:21:34.690
And as a visual user,
you can see that.

00:21:34.690 --> 00:21:35.900
But what if you can't see it?

00:21:35.900 --> 00:21:37.500
You hav to hear
it, and so if it's

00:21:37.500 --> 00:21:41.150
spoken out in a
markup language that

00:21:41.150 --> 00:21:43.390
can be translated and voiced.

00:21:43.390 --> 00:21:46.510
ChemML, chemistry, has
the same kind of concept.

00:21:46.510 --> 00:21:51.490
And so being able to refer
to those different image

00:21:51.490 --> 00:21:54.440
descriptor ways that
you can describe what,

00:21:54.440 --> 00:21:57.120
to a visual person,
is just an image

00:21:57.120 --> 00:21:59.500
makes it accessible to all.

00:21:59.500 --> 00:22:00.062
Thank you.

00:22:00.062 --> 00:22:02.270
BRIGITTE GOSSELINK: So you
touched on something there

00:22:02.270 --> 00:22:04.280
that I guess I touched
on as well in my intro,

00:22:04.280 --> 00:22:06.170
in talking about what
Carlos is doing, which

00:22:06.170 --> 00:22:07.830
is this idea of open source.

00:22:07.830 --> 00:22:11.470
And one of the things that we
really promote as Google.org

00:22:11.470 --> 00:22:13.090
is the idea of openness.

00:22:13.090 --> 00:22:14.980
And it's not just for
the principle of it,

00:22:14.980 --> 00:22:17.190
but also because
it's really critical

00:22:17.190 --> 00:22:20.002
to see some of these
solutions come to scale.

00:22:20.002 --> 00:22:21.960
So when we think about
the size of the problems

00:22:21.960 --> 00:22:24.140
that people are working on,
that these organizations

00:22:24.140 --> 00:22:26.590
and others are
working on, we also

00:22:26.590 --> 00:22:28.570
have to think about
how could we imagine

00:22:28.570 --> 00:22:30.790
one organization solving this.

00:22:30.790 --> 00:22:32.670
And frankly, you can't.

00:22:32.670 --> 00:22:35.290
So actually all of these
organizations-- and most

00:22:35.290 --> 00:22:37.640
of those that we
support-- are actually

00:22:37.640 --> 00:22:39.870
working to have
people actively adopt

00:22:39.870 --> 00:22:41.420
what it is that
they're doing outside

00:22:41.420 --> 00:22:43.614
of the walls of their
organization, which

00:22:43.614 --> 00:22:46.030
in many ways is very different
than how we think, I think,

00:22:46.030 --> 00:22:48.870
about a for profit enterprise.

00:22:48.870 --> 00:22:51.050
In some ways, there's a
wall built up in order

00:22:51.050 --> 00:22:51.820
to protect that.

00:22:51.820 --> 00:22:54.380
And you ideally don't
see a lot of copycats.

00:22:54.380 --> 00:22:56.160
Obviously, it cuts
into your revenue.

00:22:56.160 --> 00:22:59.070
This is a flipped model with
what we're working with.

00:22:59.070 --> 00:23:01.609
I would love you all
to just maybe explore

00:23:01.609 --> 00:23:02.900
some of the challenges of that.

00:23:02.900 --> 00:23:04.261
Obviously there are challenges.

00:23:04.261 --> 00:23:04.760
I know that.

00:23:04.760 --> 00:23:08.060
If you just say there aren't,
we've talked about them.

00:23:08.060 --> 00:23:09.680
And also some of
what you've seen

00:23:09.680 --> 00:23:12.470
to be successful in trying
to drive that adoption

00:23:12.470 --> 00:23:16.440
beyond your own walls.

00:23:16.440 --> 00:23:18.030
Why don't you start off, Arnon.

00:23:18.030 --> 00:23:19.529
ARNON ZAMIR: I'll
be happy to share,

00:23:19.529 --> 00:23:21.740
because that's a huge
part of what we're doing.

00:23:21.740 --> 00:23:24.580
So imagine that you're
building a product.

00:23:24.580 --> 00:23:27.880
And then it's
relatively successful.

00:23:27.880 --> 00:23:29.110
You want it to grow up.

00:23:29.110 --> 00:23:32.510
And you want to scale it up.

00:23:32.510 --> 00:23:34.140
And now imagine that
your goal in this

00:23:34.140 --> 00:23:36.040
is not to sell it for
that, but to actually

00:23:36.040 --> 00:23:40.340
transform a situation,
to move the needle.

00:23:40.340 --> 00:23:43.680
In our case, our goal is to
move the needle in accessibility

00:23:43.680 --> 00:23:45.120
to assistive technology.

00:23:45.120 --> 00:23:47.890
So we want that
everywhere in the world.

00:23:47.890 --> 00:23:51.000
Assistive technology, whatever
that is for your needs

00:23:51.000 --> 00:23:53.080
will be available for
you, regardless of

00:23:53.080 --> 00:23:55.910
how much money you
have or where you are.

00:23:55.910 --> 00:23:59.580
Obviously, being a team
of seven people now--

00:23:59.580 --> 00:24:04.290
three people until recently--
we cannot do that alone.

00:24:04.290 --> 00:24:07.140
So from the ground up,
the whole mechanism

00:24:07.140 --> 00:24:10.610
behind our work at TOM
is community engagement.

00:24:10.610 --> 00:24:14.000
We actively work to transfer
ownership from our own team

00:24:14.000 --> 00:24:16.550
to the teams that are
working on specific projects.

00:24:16.550 --> 00:24:20.980
So if we have, for example, a
tablet-based accessibility app,

00:24:20.980 --> 00:24:22.650
we don't want to
direct the team.

00:24:22.650 --> 00:24:25.400
We don't want to
own the product.

00:24:25.400 --> 00:24:27.670
We just want to support
them as they own

00:24:27.670 --> 00:24:29.720
the process and the results.

00:24:29.720 --> 00:24:32.530
And this is true with
3D-printed prosthetic arms

00:24:32.530 --> 00:24:36.040
that we are doing-- sometimes
based on open source assisting

00:24:36.040 --> 00:24:38.380
models-- or with
wheelchair adjustments,

00:24:38.380 --> 00:24:40.380
or everything else.

00:24:40.380 --> 00:24:45.600
And then we actively incorporate
into our system mechanisms

00:24:45.600 --> 00:24:47.370
for replication.

00:24:47.370 --> 00:24:50.020
We are building
a website that is

00:24:50.020 --> 00:24:53.840
going to be an eBay-style
experience, a marketplace

00:24:53.840 --> 00:24:57.280
experience for people to
actively go online and download

00:24:57.280 --> 00:25:00.410
our material and copy
it and transform it.

00:25:00.410 --> 00:25:04.290
And we are heavily
encouraging teams to do this.

00:25:04.290 --> 00:25:06.640
One of our challenges
is, on the one hand,

00:25:06.640 --> 00:25:09.050
how do we get as many groups
in the world as possible

00:25:09.050 --> 00:25:12.500
to take our products, transform
them to their local needs

00:25:12.500 --> 00:25:13.920
and implement them.

00:25:13.920 --> 00:25:16.630
On the other hand, make
sure that no one is doing

00:25:16.630 --> 00:25:18.900
something unwanted with it.

00:25:18.900 --> 00:25:21.990
What would something
unwanted be?

00:25:21.990 --> 00:25:26.270
Use it for something that
we consider immoral or just

00:25:26.270 --> 00:25:28.180
irresponsible or using--

00:25:28.180 --> 00:25:29.110
BRIGITTE GOSSELINK:
Commercializing and going

00:25:29.110 --> 00:25:31.260
against your affordability
principles, for example.

00:25:31.260 --> 00:25:34.039
ARNON ZAMIR: So commercializing
is an interesting aspect

00:25:34.039 --> 00:25:35.830
because we are not
against commercializing,

00:25:35.830 --> 00:25:39.360
as long as you keep the
open source files available.

00:25:39.360 --> 00:25:41.257
So some commercialization
models can

00:25:41.257 --> 00:25:44.600
work as open source products.

00:25:44.600 --> 00:25:46.390
Some of you might
know-- do you know

00:25:46.390 --> 00:25:50.480
WordPress and a semi-famous
operation system

00:25:50.480 --> 00:25:51.280
called Android?

00:25:51.280 --> 00:25:53.690
You might have heard of.

00:25:53.690 --> 00:25:56.380
They're all based on
open source projects

00:25:56.380 --> 00:25:58.940
or they are open
source projects.

00:25:58.940 --> 00:26:01.010
And they are
relatively profitable.

00:26:01.010 --> 00:26:03.180
So that's not necessarily
a contradiction.

00:26:03.180 --> 00:26:06.750
But then again, if someone
tries to close what we're doing

00:26:06.750 --> 00:26:08.340
and not share it
with the world all,

00:26:08.340 --> 00:26:10.370
we'll have a problem with that.

00:26:10.370 --> 00:26:16.000
Organization-wise, we had
a couple of months ago,

00:26:16.000 --> 00:26:18.450
we had the team in
Canada-- very strong,

00:26:18.450 --> 00:26:21.380
very enthusiastic
about TOM's work--

00:26:21.380 --> 00:26:23.910
running around, running a
make-a-thon of their own,

00:26:23.910 --> 00:26:26.410
working now on the
second one and building

00:26:26.410 --> 00:26:29.140
a ground up operation
in a city called Calgary

00:26:29.140 --> 00:26:31.110
on the West Coast of Canada.

00:26:31.110 --> 00:26:32.810
And they went ahead
and registered

00:26:32.810 --> 00:26:35.880
an organization named
Tikkum Olam Makers, which

00:26:35.880 --> 00:26:38.870
is TOM, T-O-M. That's our name.

00:26:38.870 --> 00:26:42.610
And we said, OK,
how do we do that?

00:26:42.610 --> 00:26:45.315
And in case, Richard, you're
watching the video, hi.

00:26:49.120 --> 00:26:51.370
One approach, the
commercial approach,

00:26:51.370 --> 00:26:52.670
would be this is our name.

00:26:52.670 --> 00:26:54.420
You're not going to
do anything with that.

00:26:54.420 --> 00:26:55.970
We are going to
protect ourselves

00:26:55.970 --> 00:26:57.906
against this infringement.

00:26:57.906 --> 00:26:59.530
But then we want the
community to grow.

00:26:59.530 --> 00:27:03.120
So it's a constant debate, a
constant dialogue with them,

00:27:03.120 --> 00:27:05.510
understanding the limits.

00:27:05.510 --> 00:27:07.370
And remember that
we are very young.

00:27:07.370 --> 00:27:10.500
We've been doing this
for about two years.

00:27:10.500 --> 00:27:12.350
And there's no
other organization

00:27:12.350 --> 00:27:16.190
to look and learn
from, almost none.

00:27:16.190 --> 00:27:19.910
So it's a constant balancing
and pushing back and forward

00:27:19.910 --> 00:27:20.600
process.

00:27:20.600 --> 00:27:24.740
Right now, very challenging
but very satisfying,

00:27:24.740 --> 00:27:26.600
and we're seeing growth.

00:27:26.600 --> 00:27:28.100
HOLGER DIETERICH:
Actually also what

00:27:28.100 --> 00:27:31.855
we learned is that I have
lot of friends in Berlin

00:27:31.855 --> 00:27:33.480
who are working in
startups and saying,

00:27:33.480 --> 00:27:35.870
what's the business
model behind WheelMap?

00:27:35.870 --> 00:27:37.980
Would you put advertising on it?

00:27:37.980 --> 00:27:41.940
Or do you have an API and sell
by the 1,000 maps you serve

00:27:41.940 --> 00:27:43.159
or something like that?

00:27:43.159 --> 00:27:44.700
But we really made
the hard decision.

00:27:44.700 --> 00:27:46.035
We are a nonprofit organization.

00:27:46.035 --> 00:27:47.410
So we will never
be millionaires.

00:27:47.410 --> 00:27:49.290
We are out there
to save the world.

00:27:49.290 --> 00:27:51.570
So what we want to
maximize is impact.

00:27:51.570 --> 00:27:53.680
So the more people that
use it, the better.

00:27:53.680 --> 00:27:58.100
If I put a price tag on
this, it will hinder my goal.

00:27:58.100 --> 00:28:00.770
And we will potentially
not reach as many people.

00:28:00.770 --> 00:28:02.370
So our apps are free.

00:28:02.370 --> 00:28:06.430
We want to encourage that
data is open and free.

00:28:06.430 --> 00:28:09.280
At least it's available in
an understandable format

00:28:09.280 --> 00:28:11.680
so that people can understand
where to find this,

00:28:11.680 --> 00:28:13.950
because once you decide
that's your goal,

00:28:13.950 --> 00:28:16.430
you should put all
the effort into that.

00:28:16.430 --> 00:28:18.030
And what we learned
along the way,

00:28:18.030 --> 00:28:20.940
working also with organizations
like Google and other

00:28:20.940 --> 00:28:26.090
commercial organizations
is that they appreciate

00:28:26.090 --> 00:28:28.010
what we do and want to help.

00:28:28.010 --> 00:28:31.200
And they help us do
this along the way.

00:28:31.200 --> 00:28:34.460
So for example,
we're doing a project

00:28:34.460 --> 00:28:38.440
with a German railway system,
so the railway corporation.

00:28:38.440 --> 00:28:41.350
It's an organization
with 300,000 employees.

00:28:41.350 --> 00:28:43.150
And what we're
interested in is you

00:28:43.150 --> 00:28:46.500
don't want to get stuck
at a train station

00:28:46.500 --> 00:28:48.130
because the elevator
is not working.

00:28:48.130 --> 00:28:49.740
So you need real
time information on

00:28:49.740 --> 00:28:52.580
is an elevator working
or not, on a lift.

00:28:52.580 --> 00:28:55.500
So we built a project
to highlight that.

00:28:55.500 --> 00:28:58.730
But there wasn't a good
realtime API from them.

00:28:58.730 --> 00:29:00.680
So we built
something on scraping

00:29:00.680 --> 00:29:02.910
and we're stealing
actually from their website

00:29:02.910 --> 00:29:05.510
to show that demo
that what we could do.

00:29:05.510 --> 00:29:08.354
And instead of hating us
they said, hey, let's talk.

00:29:08.354 --> 00:29:09.520
How can we make this happen?

00:29:09.520 --> 00:29:11.020
We don't really understand.

00:29:11.020 --> 00:29:14.980
And now they have a full-fledged
open data initiative

00:29:14.980 --> 00:29:16.630
to make this happen.

00:29:16.630 --> 00:29:19.000
And now they have
a realtime API,

00:29:19.000 --> 00:29:22.710
which can be included in all
travel planning around Germany.

00:29:22.710 --> 00:29:23.960
And that's our goal.

00:29:23.960 --> 00:29:28.190
So and actually now
we're consulting them.

00:29:28.190 --> 00:29:29.960
And they pay us for this.

00:29:29.960 --> 00:29:32.440
And that's maybe how
good things can happen.

00:29:32.440 --> 00:29:34.410
And we maximize our impact.

00:29:34.410 --> 00:29:36.650
So if we would
charge for that, we

00:29:36.650 --> 00:29:38.850
wouldn't have this
liaison, this relationship

00:29:38.850 --> 00:29:40.570
in the first place.

00:29:40.570 --> 00:29:42.780
So it's very different
from-- well, in one area,

00:29:42.780 --> 00:29:46.040
it's also we must
not go bankrupt.

00:29:46.040 --> 00:29:47.630
Otherwise we cannot
save the world.

00:29:47.630 --> 00:29:51.000
But otherwise, we need
to trust in our cause.

00:29:51.000 --> 00:29:53.700
UMESH PANDYA: I'd like to
iterate on both your points is

00:29:53.700 --> 00:29:56.620
that we believe that
adoption of the standard

00:29:56.620 --> 00:29:59.090
directly equals to
the social impact.

00:29:59.090 --> 00:30:01.100
And we know that,
as an organization,

00:30:01.100 --> 00:30:02.100
we can't do it all.

00:30:02.100 --> 00:30:04.740
We need to bring together
transport networks,

00:30:04.740 --> 00:30:06.150
or built-environment owners.

00:30:06.150 --> 00:30:09.129
We need to bring together
charities and vision impaired

00:30:09.129 --> 00:30:11.420
people to organizations that
look after vision impaired

00:30:11.420 --> 00:30:12.070
people.

00:30:12.070 --> 00:30:14.361
We need to bring together
the software and the hardware

00:30:14.361 --> 00:30:16.502
guys that work in the
indoor navigation space.

00:30:16.502 --> 00:30:17.960
We need to bring
in the researchers

00:30:17.960 --> 00:30:20.517
and the universities that
are dealing with this.

00:30:20.517 --> 00:30:22.350
And so we've created
the Wayfindr community,

00:30:22.350 --> 00:30:25.850
where we've got a good amount
of members in there now.

00:30:25.850 --> 00:30:27.610
And we're scaling
that up, because we

00:30:27.610 --> 00:30:31.440
have now the second part of
our standard development--

00:30:31.440 --> 00:30:34.520
which we released last week--
is to now work together

00:30:34.520 --> 00:30:37.170
with these organizations to
develop the standard together.

00:30:37.170 --> 00:30:40.874
So our potential clients
or the potential people

00:30:40.874 --> 00:30:42.540
that will increase
the adoption are also

00:30:42.540 --> 00:30:45.020
baked into the process
of creating our product.

00:30:45.020 --> 00:30:47.430
So not only our users
are part of our process,

00:30:47.430 --> 00:30:49.350
our customers are also
part of our process

00:30:49.350 --> 00:30:51.801
to send out and
develop our product.

00:30:51.801 --> 00:30:54.050
So we know that we're making
something that's actually

00:30:54.050 --> 00:30:56.360
usable and somebody needs,
rather than something

00:30:56.360 --> 00:30:57.682
that's a pure guess.

00:30:57.682 --> 00:30:59.140
And that's why it's
quite important

00:30:59.140 --> 00:31:02.330
to have these people really
close and work alongside you

00:31:02.330 --> 00:31:04.260
in a collaborative manner.

00:31:04.260 --> 00:31:06.510
BRIGITTE GOSSELINK: So I
feel like you guys are making

00:31:06.510 --> 00:31:11.814
it sound really easy to save
the world, which is great,

00:31:11.814 --> 00:31:14.230
because we would love to have
more people working on this.

00:31:14.230 --> 00:31:16.100
But I know it's
also pretty hard,

00:31:16.100 --> 00:31:19.140
and that you all had
a bunch of challenges

00:31:19.140 --> 00:31:22.175
that you're experiencing
all the time.

00:31:22.175 --> 00:31:24.050
And I think some of
these are parts of those.

00:31:24.050 --> 00:31:27.370
But I would love to just hear
a couple of stories about some

00:31:27.370 --> 00:31:29.202
of the hard part of
this, what's been

00:31:29.202 --> 00:31:31.410
a really challenging problem
that you've encountered,

00:31:31.410 --> 00:31:34.470
and how you've
worked through that,

00:31:34.470 --> 00:31:36.580
or the craziest day
at work that you had,

00:31:36.580 --> 00:31:38.190
or something like that.

00:31:38.190 --> 00:31:39.170
Yeah, go ahead.

00:31:39.170 --> 00:31:40.584
Or go ahead Ginny.

00:31:40.584 --> 00:31:41.750
GINNY GRANT: I could do one.

00:31:41.750 --> 00:31:43.990
I mean, there's many
crazy days at work.

00:31:43.990 --> 00:31:45.460
But that's why we all do it.

00:31:45.460 --> 00:31:47.010
We love it.

00:31:47.010 --> 00:31:50.100
When Bookshare started,
there was obviously

00:31:50.100 --> 00:31:53.670
a concern or almost a threat
felt by the publishing industry

00:31:53.670 --> 00:31:56.380
that we were somehow stealing
the intellectual property, very

00:31:56.380 --> 00:31:58.530
much in the sense of music,
if you think about some

00:31:58.530 --> 00:32:02.710
of the shared music services
that there were for a while.

00:32:02.710 --> 00:32:06.690
But Benetech is very, very clear
on digital rights management

00:32:06.690 --> 00:32:07.670
and policies.

00:32:07.670 --> 00:32:10.920
And so we've had to really step
up our game there and prove

00:32:10.920 --> 00:32:14.170
that we're not trying to
share intellectual property.

00:32:14.170 --> 00:32:15.190
It's very important.

00:32:15.190 --> 00:32:17.440
But then the other thing
we've done is, to your point,

00:32:17.440 --> 00:32:20.670
we've really worked with
the publishing industry

00:32:20.670 --> 00:32:23.880
to produce standards that
they will then, in turn,

00:32:23.880 --> 00:32:26.080
start to build out
all of the books

00:32:26.080 --> 00:32:31.230
and magazines and literature
with these standards that

00:32:31.230 --> 00:32:33.710
will enable everybody
to be able to use them.

00:32:33.710 --> 00:32:37.220
Accessible, born accessible,
and accessible for all.

00:32:37.220 --> 00:32:39.976
So I think it was a huge
challenge at the beginning.

00:32:39.976 --> 00:32:41.600
And we now have
publishers coming to us

00:32:41.600 --> 00:32:44.230
saying, how can we
get into your group?

00:32:44.230 --> 00:32:46.850
And in fact, teach us
how to make the books

00:32:46.850 --> 00:32:48.320
that we make more accessible.

00:32:48.320 --> 00:32:52.905
So that has been a huge
switch, again, needle moving.

00:32:52.905 --> 00:32:54.530
BRIGITTE GOSSELINK:
Do you want to add?

00:32:54.530 --> 00:32:59.800
UMESH PANDYA: I mean, we
move daily between granular

00:32:59.800 --> 00:33:00.980
to a high level.

00:33:00.980 --> 00:33:03.580
And what I mean by that is how
we develop the product, what

00:33:03.580 --> 00:33:06.310
the process is, what the
upgrades we're going to do,

00:33:06.310 --> 00:33:08.280
to the bigger level
which is how we're

00:33:08.280 --> 00:33:10.470
going to change
policy in London,

00:33:10.470 --> 00:33:12.020
especially right around the--

00:33:12.020 --> 00:33:13.340
BRIGITTE GOSSELINK: Just you,
you're gonna do it yourself.

00:33:13.340 --> 00:33:15.923
UMESH PANDYA: So how do we deal
with that when you're flipping

00:33:15.923 --> 00:33:17.995
between these two things?

00:33:17.995 --> 00:33:18.870
And it's really hard.

00:33:18.870 --> 00:33:22.900
Because when you're used to
making digital products, which

00:33:22.900 --> 00:33:26.420
you can just evolve overnight
or every hour, and then

00:33:26.420 --> 00:33:28.940
you're working with a system
that changes over years,

00:33:28.940 --> 00:33:30.398
how do you ensure
that you're going

00:33:30.398 --> 00:33:33.899
to be still alive to see
the fruits of your labor,

00:33:33.899 --> 00:33:36.190
and then see whether it's
actually delivered an impact?

00:33:36.190 --> 00:33:38.273
So these are the kind of
things that bounce around

00:33:38.273 --> 00:33:39.730
in our minds,
which are like, OK,

00:33:39.730 --> 00:33:42.830
are we using our
time efficiently?

00:33:42.830 --> 00:33:44.370
And where do we
push our efforts?

00:33:44.370 --> 00:33:46.669
Before when we would work
for clients and do products,

00:33:46.669 --> 00:33:48.960
it's like, here we're going
to push these pixels around

00:33:48.960 --> 00:33:50.751
and make it really
nice, and dah, dah, dah.

00:33:50.751 --> 00:33:53.120
But when it becomes more
about delivering this change,

00:33:53.120 --> 00:33:54.745
it's all about
actually, you know what?

00:33:54.745 --> 00:33:56.330
Some of that can stay there.

00:33:56.330 --> 00:33:57.420
Don't worry about that.

00:33:57.420 --> 00:33:59.961
We need to deliver this, because
this is the impact that it's

00:33:59.961 --> 00:34:01.390
going to directly deliver.

00:34:01.390 --> 00:34:04.840
So it's kind of a flip,
been quite a flip for us.

00:34:04.840 --> 00:34:06.870
HOLGER DIETERICH:
So one small thing

00:34:06.870 --> 00:34:10.179
I can tell you-- maybe US app
developers can relate to-- is

00:34:10.179 --> 00:34:12.580
that it's like being
a charity is not

00:34:12.580 --> 00:34:14.368
an excuse for bad quality.

00:34:14.368 --> 00:34:17.320
So we, for example, we
didn't have a lot of testing.

00:34:17.320 --> 00:34:19.080
And we were learning
it along the way.

00:34:19.080 --> 00:34:21.860
And in the beginning, when
you didn't allow location,

00:34:21.860 --> 00:34:25.211
and you opened the app, you were
getting weird error messages.

00:34:25.211 --> 00:34:27.710
Something's not working, and
you have to click it five times

00:34:27.710 --> 00:34:28.614
to get rid of it.

00:34:28.614 --> 00:34:30.030
And then maybe you
don't even have

00:34:30.030 --> 00:34:31.780
point of interest or
something like that.

00:34:31.780 --> 00:34:34.520
So we didn't notice that
somebody would do this

00:34:34.520 --> 00:34:36.130
because we didn't think of it.

00:34:36.130 --> 00:34:37.780
And we're stupid, maybe.

00:34:37.780 --> 00:34:40.389
But we immediately got one
star reviews on the app store

00:34:40.389 --> 00:34:43.540
for a free app run by a
charity on donors' money.

00:34:43.540 --> 00:34:45.594
And we were like, what?

00:34:45.594 --> 00:34:47.010
We're putting our
heart into this.

00:34:47.010 --> 00:34:49.449
And you're still like,
immediately one star, one star,

00:34:49.449 --> 00:34:50.810
one star.

00:34:50.810 --> 00:34:53.810
But actually it's also good,
because it proves the point

00:34:53.810 --> 00:34:58.770
that they deserve good quality,
and that we must deliver this

00:34:58.770 --> 00:34:59.480
as well.

00:34:59.480 --> 00:35:01.290
And we're just
considered another app.

00:35:01.290 --> 00:35:03.472
It's actually an achievement
that is not like,

00:35:03.472 --> 00:35:04.570
it's kind of crappy.

00:35:04.570 --> 00:35:05.435
But it's charity.

00:35:05.435 --> 00:35:06.506
Well, it's not anymore.

00:35:06.506 --> 00:35:07.630
It has to be well-designed.

00:35:07.630 --> 00:35:09.130
And it has to work.

00:35:09.130 --> 00:35:11.607
And we worked a long
time on doing this.

00:35:11.607 --> 00:35:13.440
And I'm proud that the
apps are working now.

00:35:13.440 --> 00:35:16.574
And you don't have to have
location enabled all the time.

00:35:16.574 --> 00:35:18.240
BRIGITTE GOSSELINK:
I think we sometimes

00:35:18.240 --> 00:35:20.950
have this myth a little bit
that either products that

00:35:20.950 --> 00:35:25.180
are done through nonprofits
can be fine but not great.

00:35:25.180 --> 00:35:28.340
Or that doing this type of work
is actually easier than harder.

00:35:28.340 --> 00:35:29.690
I think sometimes it's both.

00:35:29.690 --> 00:35:30.330
It's fun.

00:35:30.330 --> 00:35:31.740
And you get inspired by it.

00:35:31.740 --> 00:35:33.830
But it's also a lot
of hard challenges.

00:35:33.830 --> 00:35:37.250
I would love for you all, who
have made this move from being

00:35:37.250 --> 00:35:39.581
technologists in maybe a
more mainstream environment,

00:35:39.581 --> 00:35:42.080
to doing things that are really
using those technical skills

00:35:42.080 --> 00:35:43.820
for good, inspire
some people out here

00:35:43.820 --> 00:35:47.920
to do the same who are
listening to you all speak.

00:35:47.920 --> 00:35:50.200
Arnon, this is what
you do every day,

00:35:50.200 --> 00:35:53.540
so maybe I'll turn
it to you to start.

00:35:53.540 --> 00:35:56.450
ARNON ZAMIR: First of all, yes,
this is what we do every day.

00:35:56.450 --> 00:35:59.620
We have a very simple
strategic approach,

00:35:59.620 --> 00:36:02.760
which is do and do now.

00:36:02.760 --> 00:36:05.120
We're very open
for technologists

00:36:05.120 --> 00:36:07.200
and half-technologists,
and sometimes

00:36:07.200 --> 00:36:13.460
non-technologists to join us
and participate in a development

00:36:13.460 --> 00:36:16.560
of some feature in a product.

00:36:16.560 --> 00:36:19.660
And as a person
reaches-- partially

00:36:19.660 --> 00:36:23.550
our inspiration John
Shull from e-NABLE says,

00:36:23.550 --> 00:36:25.390
a prosthetic arm
that is 3D printed

00:36:25.390 --> 00:36:30.250
needs to just be diminishingly
better than nothing.

00:36:30.250 --> 00:36:32.550
And we are very good that
bringing together people

00:36:32.550 --> 00:36:36.460
to develop solutions that
are diminishingly better

00:36:36.460 --> 00:36:41.060
than nothing and then very,
very better than nothing.

00:36:41.060 --> 00:36:47.060
And you're all invited to
join, because you don't

00:36:47.060 --> 00:36:48.490
need to change everything.

00:36:48.490 --> 00:36:50.900
We're not asking people
to stop what they're doing

00:36:50.900 --> 00:36:54.200
and start doing just
work for society.

00:36:54.200 --> 00:36:57.960
We're asking people to donate
either three days in the year,

00:36:57.960 --> 00:36:59.830
or three hours in the week.

00:36:59.830 --> 00:37:02.220
And we have a non-written
agreement with them.

00:37:02.220 --> 00:37:03.500
You give us your time.

00:37:03.500 --> 00:37:05.880
And we'll make sure it's
dedicated to something very

00:37:05.880 --> 00:37:08.660
good, which is many times
going to sustain and move

00:37:08.660 --> 00:37:12.300
forward and grow and
change somebody's life.

00:37:12.300 --> 00:37:16.430
And the world is full with
opportunities to do good things

00:37:16.430 --> 00:37:17.790
and to marvel in them.

00:37:17.790 --> 00:37:22.890
And I'm very happy to engage
everyone online and offline

00:37:22.890 --> 00:37:24.660
in our activity.

00:37:24.660 --> 00:37:28.510
I want to tell a very
short story about a product

00:37:28.510 --> 00:37:29.886
that you can see
in a booth here.

00:37:29.886 --> 00:37:32.343
BRIGITTE GOSSELINK: It's in
the Access and Empathy Sandbox,

00:37:32.343 --> 00:37:33.730
if you haven't made it by.

00:37:33.730 --> 00:37:36.060
ARNON ZAMIR: That booth.

00:37:36.060 --> 00:37:38.050
There's a product
called The Grabber.

00:37:38.050 --> 00:37:41.910
It looks like a pair of clamps,
with a mouth operated thingy

00:37:41.910 --> 00:37:42.930
at the end.

00:37:42.930 --> 00:37:46.730
It was created
with a friend named

00:37:46.730 --> 00:37:50.010
Kim from Northern California.

00:37:50.010 --> 00:37:52.670
She was born, unfortunately,
with no limbs.

00:37:52.670 --> 00:37:55.020
And she had some
difficulties reaching

00:37:55.020 --> 00:37:58.570
things that are far from
her side, from her reach

00:37:58.570 --> 00:37:59.710
by her mouth.

00:37:59.710 --> 00:38:03.550
And it was created exactly to
her measurements, to her need,

00:38:03.550 --> 00:38:05.640
and relatively successful.

00:38:05.640 --> 00:38:11.210
About a week ago, I got this
video of a Whatsapp showing

00:38:11.210 --> 00:38:14.690
the same instrument
transferred into something new,

00:38:14.690 --> 00:38:19.980
kind of forked like a open
source software can be forked.

00:38:19.980 --> 00:38:21.480
The guys took it.

00:38:21.480 --> 00:38:24.700
And on the clamps, they
put the hands of a doll

00:38:24.700 --> 00:38:29.010
and the head of a doll
and two bells at the end.

00:38:29.010 --> 00:38:32.800
And now it is a
clapping doll that

00:38:32.800 --> 00:38:36.280
is used for a parent, which is
disabled from the neck down,

00:38:36.280 --> 00:38:39.560
to play with his
four-year-old daughter.

00:38:39.560 --> 00:38:40.320
He's holding it.

00:38:40.320 --> 00:38:42.840
And he can clap the hands,
which he couldn't before.

00:38:42.840 --> 00:38:47.070
Exactly the same mechanism,
different interpretation.

00:38:47.070 --> 00:38:51.160
We could never have gotten
to this without open source

00:38:51.160 --> 00:38:54.160
accessibility and without
the community being so daring

00:38:54.160 --> 00:38:56.960
and doing stuff we're
never thinking of.

00:38:56.960 --> 00:38:57.530
So join us.

00:38:57.530 --> 00:38:59.780
BRIGITTE GOSSELINK: Ginny,
what advice would you have?

00:38:59.780 --> 00:39:02.797
And what's one thing that people
can do walking out of here?

00:39:02.797 --> 00:39:04.380
GINNY GRANT: Well,
besides making sure

00:39:04.380 --> 00:39:08.240
that anything you build can be
used with a single oven mitt,

00:39:08.240 --> 00:39:12.630
or turn off your
monitor and your volume

00:39:12.630 --> 00:39:14.370
to make sure that
anyone and everyone can

00:39:14.370 --> 00:39:15.828
use whatever you're
building, which

00:39:15.828 --> 00:39:17.120
is going to be great quality.

00:39:17.120 --> 00:39:19.078
Of course, there's always
applying to Benetech.

00:39:19.078 --> 00:39:21.580
We have multiple
jobs open that would

00:39:21.580 --> 00:39:23.254
do all kinds of great things.

00:39:23.254 --> 00:39:25.420
But I would say definitely
build out your ecosystem.

00:39:25.420 --> 00:39:27.230
Get to know people
who care about this.

00:39:27.230 --> 00:39:30.102
And demand accessibility
everywhere.

00:39:30.102 --> 00:39:31.810
HOLGER DIETERICH: I
think what we learned

00:39:31.810 --> 00:39:35.080
is that we can-- if you want
to do something and support

00:39:35.080 --> 00:39:37.170
a nonprofit
organization like ours

00:39:37.170 --> 00:39:41.060
or like the others,
empathy is fine.

00:39:41.060 --> 00:39:43.590
But what we do need
is your expertise.

00:39:43.590 --> 00:39:46.870
One idea is in the beginning,
we had on our website,

00:39:46.870 --> 00:39:48.030
you want to become a hero?

00:39:48.030 --> 00:39:49.580
Help us, something like that.

00:39:49.580 --> 00:39:50.600
Contact us.

00:39:50.600 --> 00:39:53.050
So we got random people
wanting to volunteer.

00:39:53.050 --> 00:39:54.210
We changed this completely.

00:39:54.210 --> 00:39:57.370
We said, we need a
JavaScript fronted expert

00:39:57.370 --> 00:40:01.100
in design, three months, unpaid,
one day per week-- something

00:40:01.100 --> 00:40:03.990
like that-- for a nonprofit
organization as volunteer work.

00:40:03.990 --> 00:40:06.050
So we were blunt and
upfront about this.

00:40:06.050 --> 00:40:08.580
And we actually got
something like applications

00:40:08.580 --> 00:40:12.150
from really cool
people we hired later.

00:40:12.150 --> 00:40:16.189
Because it was sometimes
the first moment when

00:40:16.189 --> 00:40:18.480
they could say, hey I can
play with this cool framework

00:40:18.480 --> 00:40:21.660
for the first time and
actually have an impact.

00:40:21.660 --> 00:40:23.600
One story is that
the first Android

00:40:23.600 --> 00:40:26.820
app was built by our users
who were hating that we only

00:40:26.820 --> 00:40:28.622
were on iOS.

00:40:28.622 --> 00:40:31.321
And we said like, well, we don't
have the means to pay somebody

00:40:31.321 --> 00:40:31.820
to do this.

00:40:31.820 --> 00:40:34.140
And we said, but I can
bring you together.

00:40:34.140 --> 00:40:36.670
And actually three
people came together

00:40:36.670 --> 00:40:37.910
to build this remotely.

00:40:37.910 --> 00:40:39.510
And one actually
quit his day job

00:40:39.510 --> 00:40:41.740
and became a freelance
Android developer afterwards,

00:40:41.740 --> 00:40:45.080
because he had this reference
of a successful world app

00:40:45.080 --> 00:40:46.080
with a worldwide impact.

00:40:49.030 --> 00:40:50.680
We completely
trusted this person

00:40:50.680 --> 00:40:52.020
because there was nothing.

00:40:52.020 --> 00:40:53.380
What can go wrong?

00:40:53.380 --> 00:40:54.250
We have a back end.

00:40:54.250 --> 00:40:55.280
We have an API.

00:40:55.280 --> 00:40:58.540
Cool things can be
built. And I think this

00:40:58.540 --> 00:41:00.310
is where it should come from.

00:41:00.310 --> 00:41:03.110
I'm interested in this framework
and this new technology.

00:41:03.110 --> 00:41:05.240
I always wanted to
try this and that out.

00:41:05.240 --> 00:41:09.280
So there are places
where you can Google,

00:41:09.280 --> 00:41:12.690
where you can search for
charities or things you

00:41:12.690 --> 00:41:15.090
can help by the programming
language you prefer,

00:41:15.090 --> 00:41:16.720
for example.

00:41:16.720 --> 00:41:19.880
We, for example, we have on
GitHub all our source code.

00:41:19.880 --> 00:41:24.340
And we have issues which have
the tag easy and mentored

00:41:24.340 --> 00:41:27.350
so that we can bring new
contributors on board

00:41:27.350 --> 00:41:29.400
and not just say, hey,
check out the whole thing.

00:41:29.400 --> 00:41:30.570
And you will figure it out.

00:41:30.570 --> 00:41:32.007
That's not how it works.

00:41:32.007 --> 00:41:33.090
Start with something easy.

00:41:33.090 --> 00:41:36.010
And if it's fun, do more.

00:41:36.010 --> 00:41:38.952
As you contribute and submit
a pull request, and then we

00:41:38.952 --> 00:41:40.160
will look at it and merge it.

00:41:40.160 --> 00:41:41.500
And maybe you do more.

00:41:41.500 --> 00:41:44.680
So think of what you would like
to work, what's fun for you.

00:41:44.680 --> 00:41:46.230
And then, I think,
this collaboration

00:41:46.230 --> 00:41:48.115
will work really well.

00:41:48.115 --> 00:41:49.490
UMESH PANDYA: I'll
keep it short.

00:41:49.490 --> 00:41:52.700
I think it's going to
be quite immediate.

00:41:52.700 --> 00:41:54.825
I'm assuming that most
of you are developers.

00:41:54.825 --> 00:41:56.460
I've done this before.

00:41:56.460 --> 00:42:02.150
It might get you fired or
it might not get you fired.

00:42:02.150 --> 00:42:05.640
You're the guys that
actually implement the code.

00:42:05.640 --> 00:42:09.400
Now implementing accessibility
into it is not a hard effort.

00:42:09.400 --> 00:42:11.397
So start rogue.

00:42:11.397 --> 00:42:12.730
Your client gives you a project.

00:42:12.730 --> 00:42:14.010
Just start implementing
it in there.

00:42:14.010 --> 00:42:14.760
It's not hard.

00:42:14.760 --> 00:42:15.880
We've done it before.

00:42:15.880 --> 00:42:17.250
Now then you can then
go back to your client

00:42:17.250 --> 00:42:19.125
and say, look, actually,
like 70% of your app

00:42:19.125 --> 00:42:19.900
is now accessible.

00:42:19.900 --> 00:42:21.490
Do you want to make the
rest of it accessible?

00:42:21.490 --> 00:42:23.073
I've seen that work
many times before.

00:42:23.073 --> 00:42:26.300
So I'd recommend you go
and do that immediately.

00:42:26.300 --> 00:42:29.830
From a Wayfindr point of
view, we are an open standard.

00:42:29.830 --> 00:42:32.800
So we want you guys to
come along and if you can,

00:42:32.800 --> 00:42:33.730
contribute towards it.

00:42:33.730 --> 00:42:35.220
If you can, share.

00:42:35.220 --> 00:42:36.580
And we would love your feedback.

00:42:36.580 --> 00:42:38.210
And this is how we want to grow.

00:42:38.210 --> 00:42:40.285
So hit us up at
wayfindr.net/standard--

00:42:40.285 --> 00:42:43.990
that's wayfinder without
the E. And we'd love to hear

00:42:43.990 --> 00:42:45.204
your feedback.

00:42:45.204 --> 00:42:46.370
BRIGITTE GOSSELINK: Perfect.

00:42:46.370 --> 00:42:48.710
Well, one of my
favorite parts of my job

00:42:48.710 --> 00:42:51.850
is that I have the privilege
to meet passionate people who

00:42:51.850 --> 00:42:54.640
are working to use
technology for social good.

00:42:54.640 --> 00:42:57.430
So I'm glad to have been able
to share that privilege a little

00:42:57.430 --> 00:42:58.910
bit with you all today.

00:42:58.910 --> 00:43:00.650
Please join me in
thanking our panelists.

00:43:00.650 --> 00:43:03.100
And let's go hang out with
the fun people outside.

00:43:03.100 --> 00:43:06.450
