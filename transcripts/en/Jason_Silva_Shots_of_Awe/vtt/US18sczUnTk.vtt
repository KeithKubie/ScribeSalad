[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:00:14.610 --> 00:00:16.690
JASON SILVA: So I've
always been fascinated

00:00:16.690 --> 00:00:20.050
by the relationship between
creativity and madness, right?

00:00:20.050 --> 00:00:22.190
Like Timothy Leary
famously said, in order

00:00:22.190 --> 00:00:24.760
to use your head, you've
got to go out of your mind.

00:00:24.760 --> 00:00:27.360
Now this of course implies
a kind of willingness

00:00:27.360 --> 00:00:30.810
to sort of go to unknown places,
to visit mental landscapes that

00:00:30.810 --> 00:00:31.490
are alien.

00:00:31.490 --> 00:00:34.820
A willingness to sort of
leave one's comfort zone,

00:00:34.820 --> 00:00:37.290
to decondition one's
thinking, one's

00:00:37.290 --> 00:00:40.000
reflexive responses
to stimuli; to go

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:42.630
to other realms of the mind.

00:00:42.630 --> 00:00:45.410
Catalyzing the imagination
is like diving head-first

00:00:45.410 --> 00:00:46.530
towards the unknown.

00:00:46.530 --> 00:00:48.488
And there's always a
potential of getting hurt.

00:00:48.488 --> 00:00:51.030
You know, it is said that
the mystic and the madman

00:00:51.030 --> 00:00:52.450
are swimming in the same waters.

00:00:52.450 --> 00:00:55.365
But the mystic, he's like
an artist surfing it down.

00:00:55.365 --> 00:00:57.210
He's bringing back visions.

00:00:57.210 --> 00:01:00.960
He's bringing back souvenirs
from these ecstatic spaces

00:01:00.960 --> 00:01:01.740
and places.

00:01:01.740 --> 00:01:04.930
But at the end of the day, the
artist does become depleted.

00:01:04.930 --> 00:01:07.990
The artist is sacrificing
part of himself

00:01:07.990 --> 00:01:11.020
to bring back those visions,
to create a phase change

00:01:11.020 --> 00:01:12.380
in the consciousness of society.

00:01:12.380 --> 00:01:13.810
He leaves the consensus trance.

00:01:13.810 --> 00:01:15.740
He leaves our cultural
operating systems.

00:01:15.740 --> 00:01:18.720
He shows us different
reality tunnels that gives us

00:01:18.720 --> 00:01:19.930
a sense of perspective.

00:01:19.930 --> 00:01:23.630
Us as consumers of art, we
pay money for them to take us

00:01:23.630 --> 00:01:25.950
to spaces that we
cannot go by ourselves.

00:01:25.950 --> 00:01:27.040
These are heroes.

00:01:27.040 --> 00:01:28.680
These are cultural luminaries.

00:01:28.680 --> 00:01:31.050
They are madmen
that somehow have

00:01:31.050 --> 00:01:33.585
been able to sort of
coax and domesticate

00:01:33.585 --> 00:01:36.910
their madness towards ends.

00:01:36.910 --> 00:01:40.610
This idea of always
having functional output.

00:01:40.610 --> 00:01:43.860
To go to Oz, to tumble
down that rabbit hole,

00:01:43.860 --> 00:01:46.430
and somehow return
to tell the tale.

00:01:46.430 --> 00:01:47.980
