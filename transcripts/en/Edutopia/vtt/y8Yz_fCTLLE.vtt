00:00:00.131 --> 00:00:02.148
- First the material is leather.

00:00:02.148 --> 00:00:02.981
- Okay.

00:00:02.981 --> 00:00:04.730
- And the black on is for night,

00:00:04.730 --> 00:00:06.931
and in the morning it's very hot,

00:00:06.931 --> 00:00:07.793
- Understood.

00:00:07.793 --> 00:00:09.208
- and it's very brown.

00:00:09.208 --> 00:00:10.041
- Okay.
Okay.

00:00:10.041 --> 00:00:10.874
- So the --

00:00:10.874 --> 00:00:13.050
- When students are doing client
projects, their engagement

00:00:13.050 --> 00:00:16.060
and their sense of
ownership is at its peak.

00:00:16.060 --> 00:00:17.840
And the learning that takes place during

00:00:17.840 --> 00:00:18.720
that time

00:00:18.720 --> 00:00:20.690
is very rich.

00:00:20.690 --> 00:00:22.160
- The material you said
was leather, right?

00:00:22.160 --> 00:00:22.993
- Yeah.

00:00:22.993 --> 00:00:25.260
- Do you wear leather in the summer?

00:00:25.260 --> 00:00:27.310
Don't you think it would get a bit heavy?

00:00:34.691 --> 00:00:36.760
- The whole idea behind the school

00:00:36.760 --> 00:00:38.800
is the child is the stakeholder.

00:00:38.800 --> 00:00:40.290
We want every child

00:00:40.290 --> 00:00:41.890
to believe that I can do

00:00:41.890 --> 00:00:42.850
what I want to do.

00:00:42.850 --> 00:00:45.080
And I can be the person I want to be.

00:00:45.080 --> 00:00:47.353
- We have never learnt to
give up in this school.

00:00:47.353 --> 00:00:49.611
It's all about, "I can."

00:00:49.611 --> 00:00:50.444
- Client projects

00:00:50.444 --> 00:00:51.626
is a wonderful process at Riverside,

00:00:51.626 --> 00:00:54.510
and it takes place across all the grades.

00:00:54.510 --> 00:00:57.120
It's a very important way for children

00:00:57.120 --> 00:00:58.540
to understand the relevance

00:00:58.540 --> 00:01:00.040
of what they're learning.

00:01:00.040 --> 00:01:01.840
The client is from the real world.

00:01:01.840 --> 00:01:04.270
Different people and
different professions.

00:01:04.270 --> 00:01:05.960
The teachers first meet the client

00:01:05.960 --> 00:01:08.040
to understand the client's need.

00:01:08.040 --> 00:01:09.020
Then with the client

00:01:09.020 --> 00:01:10.980
you co-create what is an end result

00:01:10.980 --> 00:01:12.742
that you want from the children.

00:01:12.742 --> 00:01:15.050
- The client gives you a project to do

00:01:15.050 --> 00:01:16.467
and then you have to work on it.

00:01:16.467 --> 00:01:18.060
You feel it so real.

00:01:18.060 --> 00:01:21.230
We like having challenges and all.

00:01:21.230 --> 00:01:22.740
- Before any client project,

00:01:22.740 --> 00:01:24.180
we look at the content

00:01:24.180 --> 00:01:26.720
we are going to cover in
the particular classroom.

00:01:26.720 --> 00:01:29.290
Our unit was adaptation.

00:01:29.290 --> 00:01:32.010
They're learning basically
about different habitats

00:01:32.010 --> 00:01:34.017
and which animals survive there.

00:01:34.017 --> 00:01:36.830
When we looked at this
kind of program of inquiry

00:01:36.830 --> 00:01:38.350
we thought of ,
who can be a client for us?

00:01:38.350 --> 00:01:39.958
- Good morning Riverside.

00:01:39.958 --> 00:01:41.680
- [Children] Good morning.

00:01:41.680 --> 00:01:43.060
- [Teacher] Do you all remember him?

00:01:43.060 --> 00:01:44.160
- [Children] Yes.

00:01:44.160 --> 00:01:45.015
- [Teacher] Who is he?

00:01:45.015 --> 00:01:46.506
- [Children] Captain Ayush.

00:01:46.506 --> 00:01:48.219
- (laughs)
- [Teacher] Okay.

00:01:48.219 --> 00:01:50.173
- Our client is Captain Ayush.

00:01:50.173 --> 00:01:52.000
And our client project is

00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:53.120
to make a uniform

00:01:53.120 --> 00:01:54.870
one for the desert

00:01:54.870 --> 00:01:58.043
and one for the mountains.
- [Captain] I'm open to ideas

00:01:58.043 --> 00:01:59.330
that is what I have come to you all for.

00:01:59.330 --> 00:02:00.163
- [Teacher] Okay.

00:02:00.163 --> 00:02:00.996
- [Captain] Okay.
Good luck.

00:02:00.996 --> 00:02:03.454
- Yesterday we were doing our first draft

00:02:03.454 --> 00:02:05.237
- [Teacher] This is a picture of?

00:02:05.237 --> 00:02:06.370
- [Children] Desert.

00:02:06.370 --> 00:02:09.120
- [Teacher] Desert.
So, desert is?

00:02:09.120 --> 00:02:09.975
Sandy.

00:02:09.975 --> 00:02:11.732
- [Child] Sandy.

00:02:11.732 --> 00:02:12.683
- [Teacher] Desert is hot.

00:02:12.683 --> 00:02:16.457
- We really looked at when you
were designing the uniform.

00:02:16.457 --> 00:02:19.570
The color has to camouflage
with the back ground.

00:02:19.570 --> 00:02:20.490
But along with that,

00:02:20.490 --> 00:02:23.200
the feel of the material
is equally important.

00:02:23.200 --> 00:02:24.033
- So then,

00:02:24.033 --> 00:02:24.970
there was a snow group

00:02:24.970 --> 00:02:27.231
and a desert group. And
the snow group had to put

00:02:27.231 --> 00:02:29.421
some cotton for the background

00:02:29.421 --> 00:02:31.474
and the desert group put some sand

00:02:31.474 --> 00:02:34.233
to make a habitat.
- [Teacher] Take it like this.

00:02:34.233 --> 00:02:37.080
- And then we are to choose a material.

00:02:37.080 --> 00:02:38.450
There was fur,

00:02:38.450 --> 00:02:39.716
There was synthetic.

00:02:39.716 --> 00:02:42.240
- [Teacher] Touch the particular fabric

00:02:42.240 --> 00:02:45.260
and decide is it good for desert or no.

00:02:45.260 --> 00:02:46.770
And if it is good for desert

00:02:46.770 --> 00:02:48.880
why? You need to give
me the reasons for it.

00:02:48.880 --> 00:02:49.730
Okay?

00:02:49.730 --> 00:02:50.563
- So like,

00:02:50.563 --> 00:02:52.381
I chose leather for the shoes

00:02:52.381 --> 00:02:55.167
because leather cannot get torn easily.

00:02:56.411 --> 00:02:59.154
And I chose wool for the T-shirt

00:02:59.154 --> 00:02:59.987
and pants

00:02:59.987 --> 00:03:03.652
because wool works in hot and cold also.

00:03:03.652 --> 00:03:04.734
- [Teacher] Okay.

00:03:04.734 --> 00:03:07.540
Aleya is gonna make a
uniform which can be used

00:03:07.540 --> 00:03:08.373
- [Aleya] Both this side.

00:03:08.373 --> 00:03:09.954
- [Teacher] This side
they wear it at night,

00:03:09.954 --> 00:03:11.562
and this side they wear it at?

00:03:11.562 --> 00:03:12.640
- [Aleya] Morning.

00:03:12.640 --> 00:03:14.120
- [Teacher] We'll
definitely share this idea

00:03:14.120 --> 00:03:15.030
with our client.

00:03:15.030 --> 00:03:17.222
- So once we were done
with our first draft,

00:03:17.222 --> 00:03:19.407
kids already knew we need to meet client,

00:03:19.407 --> 00:03:20.850
get the feedback.

00:03:20.850 --> 00:03:22.350
- [Teacher] We are gonna come one by one

00:03:22.350 --> 00:03:23.832
and share our idea with him.

00:03:23.832 --> 00:03:24.665
Prathma.

00:03:25.640 --> 00:03:27.960
- He had selected few drafts,

00:03:27.960 --> 00:03:29.459
one of which was mine.

00:03:29.459 --> 00:03:31.362
He liked the material

00:03:31.362 --> 00:03:32.838
but not the shoes.

00:03:32.838 --> 00:03:34.680
- [Prathma] I used rubber boots

00:03:34.680 --> 00:03:37.980
because the snow can be a little like,

00:03:37.980 --> 00:03:38.813
watery

00:03:38.813 --> 00:03:40.048
so then you don't feel cold.

00:03:40.048 --> 00:03:42.583
- [Captain] Mm. How will
you water-proof the rubber?

00:03:42.583 --> 00:03:44.440
Because if water gets into rubber

00:03:44.440 --> 00:03:45.901
then that is a big problem.

00:03:45.901 --> 00:03:47.353
- What I really see is

00:03:47.353 --> 00:03:49.811
when the person from real life

00:03:49.811 --> 00:03:51.302
comes to meet them,

00:03:51.302 --> 00:03:53.396
they took it positively.

00:03:53.396 --> 00:03:54.977
We are working for you,

00:03:54.977 --> 00:03:56.310
you have to use it

00:03:56.310 --> 00:03:57.740
and you have to feel comfortable.

00:03:57.740 --> 00:03:58.640
So whatever you will say,

00:03:58.640 --> 00:03:59.710
we take it.

00:03:59.710 --> 00:04:01.170
- Doesn't matter if we are wrong,

00:04:01.170 --> 00:04:02.464
we just keep trying.

00:04:02.464 --> 00:04:03.960
We're gonna keep trying until the client

00:04:03.960 --> 00:04:06.557
tell its perfect.

00:04:06.557 --> 00:04:07.420
- [Captain] Bye.

00:04:07.420 --> 00:04:08.830
Good luck and,

00:04:08.830 --> 00:04:09.825
work.

00:04:09.825 --> 00:04:11.950
You're doing really well.
You all can do much better.

00:04:11.950 --> 00:04:13.616
I like it. Okay?
- [Teacher] Thank you so much.

00:04:13.616 --> 00:04:14.449
- [Captain] Chalo.

00:04:14.449 --> 00:04:15.282
- [Teacher] Thank you.

00:04:15.282 --> 00:04:16.115
- [Captain] Bye bye.
- [Teacher] Thank you.

00:04:16.115 --> 00:04:16.948
- Once he is agreeing to the design,

00:04:16.948 --> 00:04:19.723
we are going to stitch
one adult size uniform,

00:04:20.725 --> 00:04:21.990
saying that this is what it looks like

00:04:21.990 --> 00:04:23.270
and feels like

00:04:23.270 --> 00:04:24.947
and then giving it to the client.

00:04:24.947 --> 00:04:26.970
- So when you have a client project,

00:04:26.970 --> 00:04:29.150
there are a lot of skills
that children build.

00:04:29.150 --> 00:04:30.710
One is the content skills,

00:04:30.710 --> 00:04:32.220
but it's also collaboration

00:04:32.220 --> 00:04:33.080
that takes place.

00:04:33.080 --> 00:04:34.870
The problem-solving that gets done.

00:04:34.870 --> 00:04:35.970
Children learn to take

00:04:35.970 --> 00:04:37.602
and give constructive feedback.

00:04:37.602 --> 00:04:39.360
So all of these are things

00:04:39.360 --> 00:04:40.561
that prepare them for life.

00:04:40.561 --> 00:04:43.040
- And when they drive something

00:04:43.040 --> 00:04:44.673
there's 100% engagement,

00:04:44.673 --> 00:04:46.915
100% efforts by kids.

00:04:46.915 --> 00:04:49.380
We are using their strategies

00:04:49.380 --> 00:04:50.363
in a real life.

00:04:50.363 --> 00:04:51.893
They will never forget it.

00:04:51.893 --> 00:04:54.560
(child talking)
