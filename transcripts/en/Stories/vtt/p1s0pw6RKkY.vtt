00:00:00.939 --> 00:00:03.230
SUBJECT 1: If I told you the
path that these people are

00:00:03.230 --> 00:00:06.210
walking on is referred to
as "the most dangerous trail

00:00:06.210 --> 00:00:09.090
in the world," I don't think
you'd be too surprised.

00:00:09.090 --> 00:00:10.970
They all hugging
a side a mountain,

00:00:10.970 --> 00:00:15.500
about 5,000 feet in the air,
hiking on a two-way path.

00:00:15.500 --> 00:00:17.810
And believe it or not,
some are doing this just

00:00:17.810 --> 00:00:19.185
to go and get a cup of tea.

00:00:24.240 --> 00:00:26.150
VIVIAN LEE: Hi, my
name is Vivian Lee.

00:00:26.150 --> 00:00:28.630
I'm a keen scuba diver
and amateur photographer,

00:00:28.630 --> 00:00:30.140
who works in the
finance industry.

00:00:30.140 --> 00:00:32.400
This photo was
taken at Hua Shan,

00:00:32.400 --> 00:00:36.360
in the Shaanxi province in
China, in the autumn of 2012.

00:00:36.360 --> 00:00:39.230
SUBJECT 1: That's Mount Hua
Shan, one of China's five

00:00:39.230 --> 00:00:40.720
sacred mountains.

00:00:40.720 --> 00:00:42.660
It's home to ancient
legends and structures,

00:00:42.660 --> 00:00:45.590
and of course many
traditions, both new and old.

00:00:45.590 --> 00:00:48.250
It is a place where people
once came to worship and seek

00:00:48.250 --> 00:00:50.520
immortality, and where
others were taken

00:00:50.520 --> 00:00:52.660
to be sacrificed to the gods.

00:00:52.660 --> 00:00:55.060
But today, it is a place
for tourists and locals

00:00:55.060 --> 00:00:58.170
to enjoy a reflective hike,
with some even leaving a prayer

00:00:58.170 --> 00:01:00.000
in the form of a gold lock.

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:02.070
It is a place to express
both your spiritual

00:01:02.070 --> 00:01:05.021
and adventurous side,
albeit a dangerous one.

00:01:05.021 --> 00:01:07.270
VIVIAN LEE: The most unique
part of this mountain hike

00:01:07.270 --> 00:01:09.040
was the cliff side plank walk.

00:01:09.040 --> 00:01:13.220
For [INAUDIBLE], we were given
a chest harness, two carabiners,

00:01:13.220 --> 00:01:15.750
and with minimal
instructions, off we went.

00:01:15.750 --> 00:01:18.510
The most daunting part
of the initial descent

00:01:18.510 --> 00:01:20.820
was down a narrow
ladder of iron rods.

00:01:20.820 --> 00:01:22.460
With two-way traffic,
there were times

00:01:22.460 --> 00:01:24.730
when two people could be
standing on the same rod,

00:01:24.730 --> 00:01:26.100
at the same time.

00:01:26.100 --> 00:01:28.900
At the bottom of this
makeshift ladder is a two foot

00:01:28.900 --> 00:01:31.190
wide plank, to traverse across.

00:01:31.190 --> 00:01:32.840
And a metal chain,
on the wall for you

00:01:32.840 --> 00:01:34.615
to clip your carabiners
in an alcove,

00:01:34.615 --> 00:01:36.390
as you make your way across.

00:01:36.390 --> 00:01:38.350
SUBJECT 1: An
estimated 100 people

00:01:38.350 --> 00:01:41.000
die every year on
Mount Hua Shan.

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:42.810
But for some, the
risk is worth it.

00:01:42.810 --> 00:01:46.550
And their award, one of the
best cups of tea in China.

00:01:46.550 --> 00:01:48.220
But for others,
it's a satisfaction

00:01:48.220 --> 00:01:51.127
of conquering the most
dangerous path in the world.

00:01:51.127 --> 00:01:52.960
VIVIAN LEE: I wanted
to capture the emotions

00:01:52.960 --> 00:01:54.360
of these daring hikers.

00:01:54.360 --> 00:01:56.920
And at the same time, find
out for myself, what compels

00:01:56.920 --> 00:01:58.340
them to take such risks.

00:01:58.340 --> 00:02:00.400
What was at the end
of this plank walk?

00:02:00.400 --> 00:02:02.070
When we reached the
end, all we found

00:02:02.070 --> 00:02:03.747
was a small Taoist shrine.

00:02:03.747 --> 00:02:05.830
But I thought it was the
sheer adrenaline of being

00:02:05.830 --> 00:02:08.830
in the clouds , that attract
people like myself here.

00:02:08.830 --> 00:02:10.889
The tea houses dotted
around the mountain

00:02:10.889 --> 00:02:13.870
used to be Taoist temples,
which has now been converted

00:02:13.870 --> 00:02:16.240
to allow hikers to
take tea breaks or camp

00:02:16.240 --> 00:02:17.820
overnight during their visit.

00:02:17.820 --> 00:02:20.960
We also enjoyed a pot of freshly
brewed Chinese tea when we

00:02:20.960 --> 00:02:23.300
finally reached the south peak.

00:02:23.300 --> 00:02:25.820
This is not for the faint
hearted, or those with vertigo,

00:02:25.820 --> 00:02:28.370
but it's definitely
worth a challenge.

00:02:28.370 --> 00:02:31.170
SUBJECT 1: Want to see even more
amazing destinations in China,

00:02:32.950 --> 00:02:34.684
you can see views like this.

00:02:34.684 --> 00:02:36.600
SUBJECT 2: This image
is about the rice fields

00:02:36.600 --> 00:02:39.410
in Tuangtang, the
biggest one in China.

00:02:39.410 --> 00:02:44.164
I was very lucky, because the
mood of the sky was perfect.

00:02:44.164 --> 00:02:46.330

don't forget to subscribe.

00:02:46.330 --> 00:02:48.060
