00:00:03.820 --> 00:00:07.990
It’s said that every young girl dreams of
one day becoming a Disney Princess.

00:00:07.990 --> 00:00:12.370
For most people, this idea remains nothing
but a dream but for a select few actresses

00:00:12.370 --> 00:00:16.320
it may actually become a reality when they
are given the chance to play Disney princesses

00:00:16.320 --> 00:00:17.550
in real life.

00:00:17.550 --> 00:00:21.510
With Disney making live adaptations of more
and more of their best stories, it looks like

00:00:21.510 --> 00:00:26.150
there will be more opportunities on the rise
for actresses to land Disney princess roles.

00:00:26.150 --> 00:00:30.539
But, as it turns out, not every actress is
interested in playing a princess and for this

00:00:30.539 --> 00:00:33.280
video we are taking a look at some who said
no.

00:00:33.280 --> 00:00:37.520
Here is our list of 10 Actors Who Refused
Disney Princess Roles.

00:00:50.640 --> 00:00:55.590
Emma Watson – Cinderella
The whole world is excitedly waiting to see

00:00:55.590 --> 00:01:00.870
Emma Watson as Disney Princess, Belle, in
the 2017 live adaption of Beauty and The Beast

00:01:00.870 --> 00:01:04.080
as the actress seems like the absolute perfect
casting decision.

00:01:04.080 --> 00:01:08.590
The world almost got to see Watson as a Disney
princess a few years earlier though as she

00:01:08.590 --> 00:01:12.540
was actually first offered the role of Cinderella
in the 2015 film.

00:01:12.540 --> 00:01:16.920
Watson turned down the part, saying she wanted
to wait for the right princess role – and

00:01:16.920 --> 00:01:18.689
it looks like Belle is it.

00:01:18.689 --> 00:01:23.720
On top of turning down Cinderella, Emma Watson
also actually turned down the lead role in

00:01:23.720 --> 00:01:25.890
2016’s musical hit La La Land.

00:01:25.890 --> 00:01:31.079
That movie has done amazingly well, so we
hope that Watson isn’t regretting her decision.

00:01:31.079 --> 00:01:35.610
Elle Fanning – The Little Mermaid (Ariel)
Get ready to see a lot of Elle Fanning in

00:01:35.610 --> 00:01:39.670
the near future, as the actress will be showing
up in about eight movies between 2017 and

00:01:39.670 --> 00:01:41.320
2018.

00:01:41.320 --> 00:01:44.960
One movie that Fanning won’t be showing
up in, however, is the live adaptation of

00:01:44.960 --> 00:01:46.170
The Little Mermaid.

00:01:46.170 --> 00:01:50.230
Fanning was originally in talks to the play
the lead role of Ariel but decided to turn

00:01:50.230 --> 00:01:54.630
it down in favor of playing Sleeping Beauty
in the 2014 film, Maleficent.

00:01:54.630 --> 00:01:58.860
This was probably a good choice as the movie
came out much sooner and has helped her launch

00:01:58.860 --> 00:02:01.530
her career to a much higher level.

00:02:01.530 --> 00:02:04.520
Beyoncé – Tiana in The Princess and The
Frog

00:02:04.520 --> 00:02:09.430
Disney made headlines in 2009 when they finally
brought the world their first African American

00:02:09.430 --> 00:02:12.720
Disney princess with Tiana in The Princess
and The Frog.

00:02:12.720 --> 00:02:17.740
The movie is a lot of fun, and Anika Noni
Rose did a great job voicing Tiana and bringing

00:02:17.740 --> 00:02:19.510
a great personality to the character.

00:02:19.510 --> 00:02:23.890
Rose wasn’t the directors first choice for
the role, however, as the filmmakers had originally

00:02:23.890 --> 00:02:25.440
offered the part to Beyoncé Knowles.

00:02:25.440 --> 00:02:29.970
Beyoncé turned the part down because she
wanted to focus on her music and she wasn’t

00:02:29.970 --> 00:02:31.720
particularly interested in the script.

00:02:31.720 --> 00:02:35.610
Yoncé is doing pretty damn well for herself
these days, so we don’t think she regrets

00:02:35.610 --> 00:02:38.070
the decision too much.

00:02:38.070 --> 00:02:42.020
Reese Witherspoon – Brave (Merida)
Reese Witherspoon has long been considered

00:02:42.020 --> 00:02:46.150
one of Hollywood’s true sweethearts so it
is no surprise that she was offered a role

00:02:46.150 --> 00:02:47.690
as a Disney princess.

00:02:47.690 --> 00:02:52.490
When Disney was getting set to make the 2012
movie Brave, they had their hopes set on Witherspoon

00:02:52.490 --> 00:02:54.240
to play the lead role, Merida.

00:02:54.240 --> 00:02:57.830
The actress was game for the part but things
started to go off the rails when she began

00:02:57.830 --> 00:03:04.860
to really struggle with the Scottish accent
necessary for the part.

00:03:04.860 --> 00:03:09.880
Eventually, the accent became too much for
Reese Witherspoon to handle, and she had to

00:03:09.880 --> 00:03:15.060
let the part go, leaving it instead for the
lesser-known actress Kelly Macdonald.

00:03:15.060 --> 00:03:20.580
Kristen Stewart – Snow White
Kristen Stewart became one of the most recognizable

00:03:20.580 --> 00:03:25.230
stars in the world when she was cast as Bella
Swan in the infamous Twilight Saga, but since

00:03:25.230 --> 00:03:29.450
those movies have ended she hasn’t been
able to find the same level of success.

00:03:29.450 --> 00:03:33.470
Her biggest role came when she was cast as
Snow White in the 2012’s Snow White and

00:03:33.470 --> 00:03:34.470
The Huntsmen.

00:03:34.470 --> 00:03:37.980
Although the movie made a lot of movie, it
was not a critical hit and Stewart decided

00:03:37.980 --> 00:03:41.590
to refuse the offer to reprise her role in
the 2016 sequel.

00:03:41.590 --> 00:03:45.560
It may be every girls dream to play a princess
but we have to hand it to Stewart for getting

00:03:45.560 --> 00:03:51.900
out ahead on this one as the sequel currently
sits at a 17% rating on rotten tomatoes.

00:03:51.900 --> 00:03:56.540
Margot Robbie – Cinderella
The Australian actress has had no problem

00:03:56.540 --> 00:04:01.390
landing major movie roles lately with recent
great performances in hits like Suicide Squad

00:04:01.390 --> 00:04:02.880
and The Wolf Of Wall Street.

00:04:02.880 --> 00:04:07.950
When Disney starting planning their 2015 live
action adaption of Cinderella, it’s no surprise

00:04:07.950 --> 00:04:10.590
that Robbie was one of the actresses at the
top of their list.

00:04:10.590 --> 00:04:14.670
Margot Robbie made it to the final stage of
auditions and it is undisclosed whether she

00:04:14.670 --> 00:04:18.950
ending up turning down the role or if the
filmmakers decided to go in another direction.

00:04:18.950 --> 00:04:23.450
In the end, the role went to Lily James and
the movie was met with moderate success.

00:04:23.450 --> 00:04:27.380
All in all, it’s probably better that Margot
Robbie held off on this one and we wouldn’t

00:04:27.380 --> 00:04:31.480
be shocked to see her as another Disney princess
in the coming years.

00:04:31.480 --> 00:04:36.310
Jennifer Aniston – Giselle (Enchanted)
Before Amy Adams was starring in Oscar movies

00:04:36.310 --> 00:04:40.350
every single year, the actress was singing
through the streets as the princess Giselle

00:04:40.350 --> 00:04:43.220
in the 2007 Disney musical, Enchanted.

00:04:43.220 --> 00:04:47.440
Adams was great in the role, but it turns
out she wasn’t the filmmakers first choice.

00:04:47.440 --> 00:04:52.010
Apparently, the role was first offered to
Jennifer Aniston but she refused the part.

00:04:52.010 --> 00:04:55.820
While this may seem like a weird casting choice
now, you have to remember that Aniston was

00:04:55.820 --> 00:05:00.530
fresh off of the hit series, Friends, and
one of the most sought after actresses around.

00:05:00.530 --> 00:05:05.310
Fast forward ten years and Amy Adams is turning
out hit after hit, while Aniston has become

00:05:05.310 --> 00:05:07.820
a veteran of the Rom-Com genre.

00:05:07.820 --> 00:05:13.680
Jodi Foster – Princess Leia
Ever since Disney got control of the Star

00:05:13.680 --> 00:05:17.900
Wars franchise, fans have been campaigning
for Princess Leia to be inducted as one of

00:05:17.900 --> 00:05:19.590
the official Disney princesses.

00:05:19.590 --> 00:05:23.810
The late Carrie Fisher is iconic in the role
and it’s really hard to imagine anyone else

00:05:23.810 --> 00:05:27.530
playing the part but it’s a little known
fact that she actually wasn’t the first

00:05:27.530 --> 00:05:28.530
choice.

00:05:28.530 --> 00:05:32.530
The role of Princess Leia was first offered
to Jodie Foster who was an up and coming star

00:05:32.530 --> 00:05:37.200
back in those days and at the age of 14 would
have been a much younger version of the character.

00:05:37.200 --> 00:05:41.950
Foster had to turn the role down due to scheduling
conflicts and we have to think it was fate

00:05:41.950 --> 00:05:46.470
as it really is hard to imagine anyone but
Fisher as Princess Leia.

00:05:46.470 --> 00:05:51.620
Shiloh Jolie-Pitt
When you are the daughter of Brad Pitt and

00:05:51.620 --> 00:05:55.770
Angelina Jolie it’s really only a matter
of time before you start getting offered movie

00:05:55.770 --> 00:05:56.770
roles.

00:05:56.770 --> 00:06:00.710
It would be most kids dream to play at Disney
princess before they turn ten but it turns

00:06:00.710 --> 00:06:05.900
out that Shiloh, the eldest Jolie-Pitt daughter,
actually turned down the role of young Aurora

00:06:05.900 --> 00:06:07.670
in her mother’s film, Maleficent.

00:06:07.670 --> 00:06:10.790
Shiloh said that she would have been more
interested in playing her mother’s role,

00:06:10.790 --> 00:06:13.210
but she will probably have to wait a while
for that one.

00:06:13.210 --> 00:06:17.740
Luckily for Angelina Jolie, she didn’t have
to look far for a second choice, as she actually

00:06:17.740 --> 00:06:21.830
cast her younger daughter, Vivienne, as the
young version of sleeping beauty.

00:06:21.830 --> 00:06:24.720
Chloe Grace Moretz – The Little Mermaid
(Ariel)

00:06:24.720 --> 00:06:29.020
Although she is yet to turn 20, Chloe Grace
Moretz has already been a huge Hollywood star

00:06:29.020 --> 00:06:30.250
for years now.

00:06:30.250 --> 00:06:34.630
From The Amityville Horror, to Kick-Ass to
Neighbors 2, Moretz has done a lot of work

00:06:34.630 --> 00:06:35.640
for someone her age.

00:06:35.640 --> 00:06:39.520
When the live adaptation of Disney’s The
Little Mermaid was announced, the filmmakers

00:06:39.520 --> 00:06:43.900
had Chloe Grace Moretz at the top of their
list to play Ariel, and originally the actress

00:06:43.900 --> 00:06:44.900
was on board.

00:06:44.900 --> 00:06:48.860
Then, last years, Chloe decided that she wanted
to take a break from acting for a bit and

00:06:48.860 --> 00:06:51.450
decided to back out of the Disney princess
role.

00:06:51.450 --> 00:06:55.650
The actress is now looking to take on more
challenging roles as she tries to break away

00:06:55.650 --> 00:07:00.680
from her past as a child star and launch a
career as a serious Hollywood actress.

00:07:00.680 --> 00:07:04.721
So there you have it, there is our list of
10 actors who refused Disney Princess movie

00:07:04.721 --> 00:07:05.721
roles.

00:07:05.721 --> 00:07:07.100

00:07:07.100 --> 00:07:13.560
