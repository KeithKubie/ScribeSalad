00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.000
That was not a proof, but it just so happens that grammars are strictly greater,

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:11.000
have more expressive power than regular expressions.

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:16.000
Anything we could specify with a regular expression, we can also specify with a grammar.

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:18.000
Let's try it out.

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:22.000
Here's another regular expression: p plus followed by i question mark.

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:24.000
I'm going to start writing out the grammar for it.

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:29.000
Uh oh. Here I've almost written the grammar but I'm going to need you to help me out.

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:32.000
I've left two blanks.

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:37.000
What I want you to do is fill in the blanks so that the regular expression

00:00:37.000 --> 09:59:59.000
and the grammar have the same language, accept exactly the same set of strings.
