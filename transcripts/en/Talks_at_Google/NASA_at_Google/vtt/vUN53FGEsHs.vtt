00:00:04.900 --> 00:00:05.820
MALE SPEAKER: This
is Jeremy Frank.

00:00:05.820 --> 00:00:08.640
He's going to [INAUDIBLE].

00:00:08.640 --> 00:00:11.220
It's turns out he went to
school with Laszlo Bock.

00:00:11.220 --> 00:00:11.810
JEREMY FRANK: Almost.

00:00:11.810 --> 00:00:12.620
MALE SPEAKER: Almost.

00:00:12.620 --> 00:00:16.045
You were off by a couple years,
at Pomona College,

00:00:16.045 --> 00:00:16.530
which I think is
kind of funny.

00:00:16.530 --> 00:00:18.470
So you send things to space.

00:00:18.470 --> 00:00:20.895
He sends his Googlers
into work.

00:00:20.895 --> 00:00:23.330
So, yeah.

00:00:23.330 --> 00:00:27.360
So I don't want to waste
too much time.

00:00:27.360 --> 00:00:30.430
But I wanted to draw attention
to his shirt.

00:00:30.430 --> 00:00:32.790
He used to work for Yoyodyne
Propulsion Systems, which is a

00:00:32.790 --> 00:00:36.683
small company in [INAUDIBLE],
right?

00:00:36.683 --> 00:00:44.160
Where they made an advance B-1
bomber subsystem for the

00:00:44.160 --> 00:00:46.500
defense department before
they were shut down.

00:00:46.500 --> 00:00:47.904
JEREMY FRANK: Yeah.

00:00:47.904 --> 00:00:50.550
I can neither confirm nor deny
that aliens were involved.

00:00:50.550 --> 00:00:50.950
MALE SPEAKER: Yeah.

00:00:50.950 --> 00:00:54.004
So you worked for
John something.

00:00:54.004 --> 00:00:57.974
Well, anyway the long and short
of it is I don't waste

00:00:57.974 --> 00:00:58.465
any more time.

00:00:58.465 --> 00:01:00.920
So please [INAUDIBLE].

00:01:00.920 --> 00:01:01.920
JEREMY FRANK: That's plausible.

00:01:01.920 --> 00:01:02.230
OK.

00:01:02.230 --> 00:01:03.230
So thank you very much.

00:01:03.230 --> 00:01:07.290
So I wanted to talk to you today
about some work that

00:01:07.290 --> 00:01:11.800
NASA is doing to figure out
how to send people to far

00:01:11.800 --> 00:01:14.600
distant planets, possibly
Mars, but possibly other

00:01:14.600 --> 00:01:15.810
things that are not quite

00:01:15.810 --> 00:01:19.040
planet-like, near-Earth asteroids.

00:01:19.040 --> 00:01:20.760
So what I want to do is tell
you a little bit about what

00:01:20.760 --> 00:01:23.620
some of those destinations are,
and how far away they

00:01:23.620 --> 00:01:26.840
are, and in particular how long
it would take to talk to

00:01:26.840 --> 00:01:30.230
a crew of astronauts who might
be at those destinations.

00:01:30.230 --> 00:01:34.510
And the reason I want to talk
about this is because when we

00:01:34.510 --> 00:01:36.750
think about how space missions
are operated today, in

00:01:36.750 --> 00:01:39.840
particular human space mission
operations, time delay is

00:01:39.840 --> 00:01:41.010
going to be a real problem.

00:01:41.010 --> 00:01:43.080
But to give you a sense of what
all that means, I need to

00:01:43.080 --> 00:01:45.450
tell you a little about
operations.

00:01:45.450 --> 00:01:47.630
And in particular, some of the
things that can go wrong

00:01:47.630 --> 00:01:49.960
during operations and why it's
really important to think

00:01:49.960 --> 00:01:52.985
about those things, especially
in the presence of these large

00:01:52.985 --> 00:01:54.330
time delays.

00:01:54.330 --> 00:01:57.360
And what this really boils
down to is a matter of

00:01:57.360 --> 00:01:58.310
communication.

00:01:58.310 --> 00:02:01.050
So the communication between the
spacecraft and the flight

00:02:01.050 --> 00:02:03.890
control team, what happens
during that communication, why

00:02:03.890 --> 00:02:05.830
people need to communicate, and
why this is going to be a

00:02:05.830 --> 00:02:08.970
little bit different if
we do these things

00:02:08.970 --> 00:02:10.960
tomorrow, than it is today.

00:02:10.960 --> 00:02:13.460
And after I do that, I can
tell you about some

00:02:13.460 --> 00:02:16.840
experiments that NASA has done
in order to really try and

00:02:16.840 --> 00:02:20.070
quantify the impact of time
delay on mission operations,

00:02:20.070 --> 00:02:22.300
explain how we try and quantify
what can go wrong,

00:02:22.300 --> 00:02:23.980
what things are going
to go right.

00:02:23.980 --> 00:02:28.660
And we have some technologies
that we've been investigating,

00:02:28.660 --> 00:02:30.930
some things that you are very
familiar with and some things

00:02:30.930 --> 00:02:32.390
that you may not be so familiar
with it, that we

00:02:32.390 --> 00:02:33.700
think are going to actually
mitigate the

00:02:33.700 --> 00:02:35.980
impact of time delay.

00:02:35.980 --> 00:02:38.150
And so I want to describe this
experiment that we did and

00:02:38.150 --> 00:02:40.710
tell you what we learned.

00:02:40.710 --> 00:02:44.710
And I have a flow of this
presentation, but please feel

00:02:44.710 --> 00:02:46.920
free to interrupt with questions
at any time.

00:02:46.920 --> 00:02:48.710
I should also warn you there
are some audience

00:02:48.710 --> 00:02:50.080
participation questions.

00:02:50.080 --> 00:02:51.950
So be prepared.

00:02:51.950 --> 00:02:55.070
I will be calling for people
to help me out here in the

00:02:55.070 --> 00:02:56.470
middle of my talk.

00:02:56.470 --> 00:03:07.100
So without further delay, that
is a picture of Apollo 11 on

00:03:07.100 --> 00:03:08.930
the lunar surface.

00:03:08.930 --> 00:03:11.690
Are you surprised at the
color of the dirt?

00:03:11.690 --> 00:03:14.090
Because the Moon's
gray, right?

00:03:14.090 --> 00:03:14.390
Well, no.

00:03:14.390 --> 00:03:15.840
It turns out not all
the Moon is gray.

00:03:15.840 --> 00:03:18.330
Sometimes it looks a little
reddish-orange.

00:03:18.330 --> 00:03:23.360
But more interestingly to us for
this talk, the Moon is a

00:03:23.360 --> 00:03:28.070
paltry 238,000 miles
away from Earth.

00:03:28.070 --> 00:03:31.780
So light travels from
the Earth to the

00:03:31.780 --> 00:03:35.506
Moon in only 1.2 seconds.

00:03:35.506 --> 00:03:37.930
Well, so in a day and age of
instant communication, 1.2

00:03:37.930 --> 00:03:39.860
seconds may seem like
a long time.

00:03:39.860 --> 00:03:41.880
But really from the point of
view of mission operations,

00:03:41.880 --> 00:03:44.300
that's not so bad.

00:03:44.300 --> 00:03:45.550
So we've done that.

00:03:45.550 --> 00:03:48.840
We've experienced that before.

00:03:48.840 --> 00:03:51.660
But there are some places that
are interesting that NASA

00:03:51.660 --> 00:03:53.580
would like to potentially send
people that are a little bit

00:03:53.580 --> 00:03:54.850
further away.

00:03:54.850 --> 00:03:57.280
One thing that you may have
been hearing a little bit

00:03:57.280 --> 00:04:01.240
about in the news recently
is asteroids.

00:04:01.240 --> 00:04:02.610
Certain classes of asteroids
have been

00:04:02.610 --> 00:04:05.240
termed near-Earth asteroids.

00:04:05.240 --> 00:04:06.720
So what is a near-Earth
asteroid?

00:04:06.720 --> 00:04:08.100
So this is one.

00:04:08.100 --> 00:04:11.280
This asteroid is called
1998 QE2.

00:04:11.280 --> 00:04:13.440
What a great sexy name.

00:04:13.440 --> 00:04:17.089
But what should be slightly more
interesting perhaps is

00:04:17.089 --> 00:04:26.810
that in May of this year, this
asteroid passed a paltry 3.6

00:04:26.810 --> 00:04:29.550
million miles from the Earth.

00:04:29.550 --> 00:04:31.820
Well, OK, so 3.6 million
miles, that

00:04:31.820 --> 00:04:33.950
sounds like a long time.

00:04:33.950 --> 00:04:35.500
It's 14 light seconds
from Earth.

00:04:35.500 --> 00:04:37.830
So it's actually quite a bit
further away from the Moon.

00:04:37.830 --> 00:04:40.220
It's not the closest thing that
has passed to the Earth

00:04:40.220 --> 00:04:42.290
and there are some others
that are further away.

00:04:42.290 --> 00:04:44.210
But the point is these are
things that are very, very

00:04:44.210 --> 00:04:44.890
interesting.

00:04:44.890 --> 00:04:47.110
They're very old.

00:04:47.110 --> 00:04:48.580
They're very scientifically
interesting.

00:04:48.580 --> 00:04:50.830
There's a lot of very, very cool
exploration science that

00:04:50.830 --> 00:04:52.190
people want to do.

00:04:52.190 --> 00:04:54.090
Some of that science we think
we want to do by sending

00:04:54.090 --> 00:04:54.950
people there.

00:04:54.950 --> 00:04:56.370
And so the question
is where are they?

00:04:56.370 --> 00:04:57.580
How far away are they?

00:04:57.580 --> 00:04:59.520
Well, so here's a
close-ish one.

00:04:59.520 --> 00:05:01.840
And here's a slightly more
interesting one.

00:05:01.840 --> 00:05:05.065
So this one's interesting
because if you take a look at

00:05:05.065 --> 00:05:07.240
it, you see these kind of smooth
surfaces and all this

00:05:07.240 --> 00:05:09.030
bumpy stuff.

00:05:09.030 --> 00:05:11.160
So your picture of asteroids
may be a great big,

00:05:11.160 --> 00:05:12.390
solid hunk of rock.

00:05:12.390 --> 00:05:14.330
Well, not all of them
are like that.

00:05:14.330 --> 00:05:16.970
Something like this may resemble
more like a great big

00:05:16.970 --> 00:05:21.060
pile of dirt in space, loosely
held together.

00:05:21.060 --> 00:05:22.520
So how many of them
are like that?

00:05:22.520 --> 00:05:24.180
Well, we don't really know.

00:05:24.180 --> 00:05:26.410
This one's a little bit
far away though.

00:05:26.410 --> 00:05:31.840
It is 26 million miles,
2.3 minute light

00:05:31.840 --> 00:05:32.740
time delay to Earth.

00:05:32.740 --> 00:05:34.540
So that one's pretty far away.

00:05:34.540 --> 00:05:36.240
And yet, there are some
asteroids like that that we're

00:05:36.240 --> 00:05:38.520
considering sending people to.

00:05:38.520 --> 00:05:40.460
So pretty far away, yes.

00:05:40.460 --> 00:05:44.590
And then, of course
there's Mars.

00:05:44.590 --> 00:05:46.000
So for those of you who
don't necessarily

00:05:46.000 --> 00:05:46.920
recognize this picture.

00:05:46.920 --> 00:05:48.930
This is Mount Sharp.

00:05:48.930 --> 00:05:50.590
This is the shadow
of Curiosity.

00:05:50.590 --> 00:05:52.650
Ooh, the shadow of Curiosity
is a little bit more shaded

00:05:52.650 --> 00:05:54.060
than I thought it would be.

00:05:54.060 --> 00:05:57.780
And so everybody knows how
far away Mars is, right?

00:05:57.780 --> 00:05:59.280
Anybody know?

00:05:59.280 --> 00:06:00.530
No.

00:06:02.280 --> 00:06:10.140
When Mars is close to Earth,
it's 35 million miles.

00:06:10.140 --> 00:06:13.280
Light takes three minutes to
get to Mars from Earth.

00:06:13.280 --> 00:06:16.140
Three minutes, that's
when it's close?

00:06:16.140 --> 00:06:18.070
What about when it's far away?

00:06:18.070 --> 00:06:23.210
Well, when it's far away, it's
pretty far, 250 million miles,

00:06:23.210 --> 00:06:26.090
24 minutes one way.

00:06:26.090 --> 00:06:29.540
So these numbers should give you
some pause when we think

00:06:29.540 --> 00:06:31.630
casually about sending people
to these places.

00:06:31.630 --> 00:06:32.880
And that's the whole point.

00:06:35.240 --> 00:06:36.950
So these are a range
of places NASA's

00:06:36.950 --> 00:06:37.940
considered sending people.

00:06:37.940 --> 00:06:39.620
So when we talk about
spaceflight mission

00:06:39.620 --> 00:06:41.820
operations, future human
destinations, this is the

00:06:41.820 --> 00:06:44.420
range of places that people are
interested in, the kinds

00:06:44.420 --> 00:06:47.150
of things that we would
like to do.

00:06:47.150 --> 00:06:54.810
So what does it take today to
actually operate a human space

00:06:54.810 --> 00:06:55.230
flight mission?

00:06:55.230 --> 00:06:56.250
What do people do?

00:06:56.250 --> 00:06:59.280
Well, they sit at these
banks of computers,

00:06:59.280 --> 00:07:00.720
many, many of them.

00:07:00.720 --> 00:07:02.740
Each one of them has a job.

00:07:02.740 --> 00:07:07.150
And that job is to keep
their crew and

00:07:07.150 --> 00:07:08.810
their spacecraft safe.

00:07:08.810 --> 00:07:10.740
That's primarily what they do.

00:07:10.740 --> 00:07:13.220
But what does that
actually mean?

00:07:13.220 --> 00:07:19.500
So to an astronaut, mission
control is the power company.

00:07:19.500 --> 00:07:20.540
They're the plumber.

00:07:20.540 --> 00:07:22.920
They're the air conditioner
repairman.

00:07:22.920 --> 00:07:24.250
They are the doctor.

00:07:24.250 --> 00:07:25.970
They're the phone company.

00:07:25.970 --> 00:07:27.650
They're geek squad.

00:07:27.650 --> 00:07:29.770
They're everything
to those people.

00:07:29.770 --> 00:07:33.590
Because any time anything goes
wrong on their spacecraft, any

00:07:33.590 --> 00:07:36.530
time the crew needs help doing
something on board their

00:07:36.530 --> 00:07:39.920
spacecraft, if they have a
problem, these are the people

00:07:39.920 --> 00:07:41.380
who they have to call.

00:07:41.380 --> 00:07:45.040
Very much like we do, only it's
not like you can drive to

00:07:45.040 --> 00:07:46.080
the doctor's office.

00:07:46.080 --> 00:07:49.390
It's not like you can get UPS
to deliver you a new hard

00:07:49.390 --> 00:07:51.280
drive for your computer.

00:07:51.280 --> 00:07:53.260
You pretty much have to take
care of it yourself, with the

00:07:53.260 --> 00:07:55.700
help of those people on the
other end of the phone.

00:07:58.440 --> 00:07:59.690
So far so good?

00:08:02.030 --> 00:08:05.980
So the people who sit in the
mission control center who

00:08:05.980 --> 00:08:08.810
assist the astronauts in doing
all of this work, they have a

00:08:08.810 --> 00:08:11.740
large profusion of different
kinds of tools that they use

00:08:11.740 --> 00:08:14.350
in order to help operate
that spacecraft.

00:08:14.350 --> 00:08:17.490
So what I want to do is show
you a couple of those tools

00:08:17.490 --> 00:08:20.070
and talk a little bit
about what they do.

00:08:20.070 --> 00:08:27.040
So one thing that they do, for
example, this is a set of what

00:08:27.040 --> 00:08:32.169
are called displays for, in this
case, it's a little hard

00:08:32.169 --> 00:08:36.120
to read, but you might be able
to see that this is ECLSS,

00:08:36.120 --> 00:08:38.690
Environmental Control and
Life Support Systems.

00:08:38.690 --> 00:08:41.039
So if you're a flight
controller who's

00:08:41.039 --> 00:08:43.960
responsibility is ECLSS, you
care about what the atmosphere

00:08:43.960 --> 00:08:46.870
inside the spacecraft
is composed of.

00:08:46.870 --> 00:08:47.520
Is it to hot?

00:08:47.520 --> 00:08:48.300
Is it to warm?

00:08:48.300 --> 00:08:50.330
Is it too cold?

00:08:50.330 --> 00:08:52.900
Does it have the right
gas composition?

00:08:52.900 --> 00:08:55.470
Is there CO2 collecting any
place inside your spacecraft,

00:08:55.470 --> 00:08:59.110
which could be very dangerous
for your astronauts?

00:08:59.110 --> 00:09:00.060
But that's what you're doing.

00:09:00.060 --> 00:09:02.430
So you have these displays which
are basically watching

00:09:02.430 --> 00:09:04.980
data which is coming from the
spacecraft and telling you

00:09:04.980 --> 00:09:06.310
whether things are doing
what they are

00:09:06.310 --> 00:09:09.000
supposed to do or not.

00:09:09.000 --> 00:09:11.290
So there are a variety of these
tools and their whole

00:09:11.290 --> 00:09:14.080
purpose in life is to give
those flight controllers

00:09:14.080 --> 00:09:16.960
insight into the spacecraft.

00:09:16.960 --> 00:09:18.640
So here's another one.

00:09:18.640 --> 00:09:21.010
So instead of just getting the
numbers and watching those

00:09:21.010 --> 00:09:21.740
numbers updating.

00:09:21.740 --> 00:09:23.960
You might need to see
plots for trends.

00:09:23.960 --> 00:09:28.040
So it's a different view of
the same class of data.

00:09:30.990 --> 00:09:34.410
So another thing that you might
need to do as a flight

00:09:34.410 --> 00:09:35.850
controller is you might actually
need to tell your

00:09:35.850 --> 00:09:38.510
vehicle to do something.

00:09:38.510 --> 00:09:42.250
So you might need to say, turn
a piece of equipment on, turn

00:09:42.250 --> 00:09:45.880
a piece of equipment
off, gather

00:09:45.880 --> 00:09:48.890
information about things.

00:09:48.890 --> 00:09:51.780
So what you now have is you
have a set of commanding

00:09:51.780 --> 00:09:54.420
displays, very similar to
your data displays.

00:09:54.420 --> 00:09:56.810
But instead of being used for
monitoring your vehicle, these

00:09:56.810 --> 00:09:58.310
are used to command
your vehicle.

00:09:58.310 --> 00:10:03.990
So a slightly different
form of a tool.

00:10:03.990 --> 00:10:05.830
Sometimes you don't want
to send one command.

00:10:05.830 --> 00:10:08.190
You may need to send a large
number of commands.

00:10:08.190 --> 00:10:10.120
And if you do this enough times,
you may want to write a

00:10:10.120 --> 00:10:14.550
simple script or essentially a
program in order to send that

00:10:14.550 --> 00:10:16.650
sequence of commands and
just watch it go.

00:10:16.650 --> 00:10:19.000
So in addition to single
commanding tools, you may have

00:10:19.000 --> 00:10:22.115
some sort of script execution
monitoring tools like this.

00:10:25.430 --> 00:10:30.500
So similar in spirit to sending
a set of commands is

00:10:30.500 --> 00:10:31.710
the idea of a procedure.

00:10:31.710 --> 00:10:34.890
So a step by step set of
instructions that someone,

00:10:34.890 --> 00:10:37.840
either a flight controller or a
crew person, is going to use

00:10:37.840 --> 00:10:39.720
in order to accomplish
some task.

00:10:39.720 --> 00:10:45.730
So in addition to just the set
of commands, you may need some

00:10:45.730 --> 00:10:47.150
explanatory text.

00:10:47.150 --> 00:10:50.300
You may have some sort of flow
control boxes, something a

00:10:50.300 --> 00:10:53.160
little bit like a flow chart
that helps you understand what

00:10:53.160 --> 00:10:56.020
it is that you're doing, what
tools you need, what pieces of

00:10:56.020 --> 00:10:57.970
information are supposed to say
what in order for you to

00:10:57.970 --> 00:10:59.400
go to the next step.

00:10:59.400 --> 00:11:01.610
So these procedures are very,
very standardized and

00:11:01.610 --> 00:11:02.630
regularized.

00:11:02.630 --> 00:11:05.100
And so there are tools to help
you see what those procedures

00:11:05.100 --> 00:11:09.710
say and to help you track
where they are.

00:11:09.710 --> 00:11:12.490
So now it is strategic level,
procedure steps are things to

00:11:12.490 --> 00:11:16.070
take tens of seconds to maybe
a minute to execute.

00:11:16.070 --> 00:11:19.530
At a much more strategic level,
on the course of a day,

00:11:19.530 --> 00:11:21.090
you have tools that help
you understand what

00:11:21.090 --> 00:11:22.670
your daily plan is.

00:11:22.670 --> 00:11:26.120
So in this case, we see a
plan for a subset of the

00:11:26.120 --> 00:11:29.930
International Space Station
astronauts over the course of

00:11:29.930 --> 00:11:32.120
a couple of hours.

00:11:32.120 --> 00:11:35.740
You're seeing information like
is it day or night apparently,

00:11:35.740 --> 00:11:37.400
because of where the
spacecraft is

00:11:37.400 --> 00:11:38.900
relative to the Sun.

00:11:38.900 --> 00:11:40.860
You're seeing what kind
of communication

00:11:40.860 --> 00:11:42.120
coverage you have.

00:11:42.120 --> 00:11:44.440
You're seeing things like what's
happening with respect

00:11:44.440 --> 00:11:48.090
to communication coverage
on the ground.

00:11:48.090 --> 00:11:49.630
Is the ground tracking
activities

00:11:49.630 --> 00:11:51.260
that the crew is doing?

00:11:51.260 --> 00:11:53.480
And so you have an information
display like this that's sort

00:11:53.480 --> 00:11:54.730
of showing you what
your plans are.

00:11:58.940 --> 00:12:04.090
So who has lost something
in your house?

00:12:04.090 --> 00:12:05.750
You don't know where it is.

00:12:05.750 --> 00:12:06.280
It's in the garage.

00:12:06.280 --> 00:12:07.530
It's in the closet.

00:12:09.470 --> 00:12:11.520
And it's really important
because you need it.

00:12:11.520 --> 00:12:13.130
Because you're going to the
beach and your kids are

00:12:13.130 --> 00:12:16.130
yelling at you because you
can't find the sand toys.

00:12:16.130 --> 00:12:18.240
OK, so astronauts don't
have sand toys.

00:12:18.240 --> 00:12:21.880
But similarly, a lot of the
activities that they do

00:12:21.880 --> 00:12:24.350
require something, say
batteries, a pair of scissors,

00:12:24.350 --> 00:12:25.710
a piece of tubing.

00:12:25.710 --> 00:12:27.490
And this is somewhere
in your space craft.

00:12:27.490 --> 00:12:29.780
Well, where is it?

00:12:29.780 --> 00:12:32.060
So in addition to all of these
activities and procedures, you

00:12:32.060 --> 00:12:34.395
may have information that's
basically logistics, stowage,

00:12:34.395 --> 00:12:35.540
and tracking.

00:12:35.540 --> 00:12:39.120
So that you can efficiently go
find those pieces of equipment

00:12:39.120 --> 00:12:41.640
that you actually need in order
to do whatever you need

00:12:41.640 --> 00:12:43.410
to do on your day.

00:12:43.410 --> 00:12:44.680
So this is also very
important.

00:12:47.680 --> 00:12:52.750
So as an aside, any web
developers in the audience?

00:12:57.500 --> 00:12:59.870
Since the year 2000, the
International Space Station

00:12:59.870 --> 00:13:04.440
has flown a variety of tools
based on web technology that

00:13:04.440 --> 00:13:05.940
help them do all of
these things.

00:13:05.940 --> 00:13:07.340
And they've also been
in use in the flight

00:13:07.340 --> 00:13:08.820
control room as well.

00:13:08.820 --> 00:13:12.210
So from what I've been able to
gather, the first of these

00:13:12.210 --> 00:13:14.510
tools was basically used to
monitor the state of air to

00:13:14.510 --> 00:13:17.040
ground file transfers so
that the crew knew

00:13:17.040 --> 00:13:18.220
what they had to do.

00:13:18.220 --> 00:13:20.880
But since then, it's been
extended to both procedure

00:13:20.880 --> 00:13:24.030
display and plan display
and execution tracking.

00:13:24.030 --> 00:13:28.780
So technology you built, may
be on board ISS today.

00:13:28.780 --> 00:13:30.800
How about that?

00:13:30.800 --> 00:13:33.430
So a small subset of the
technology that's being used

00:13:33.430 --> 00:13:35.510
is listed here.

00:13:35.510 --> 00:13:37.680
OK.

00:13:37.680 --> 00:13:39.810
So you're all experts on
operations now, right?

00:13:42.580 --> 00:13:44.090
So let's talk a little bit
about communications.

00:13:44.090 --> 00:13:46.480
So I think it's pretty clear
at this point that

00:13:46.480 --> 00:13:48.620
communications is pretty
critical to both delivering

00:13:48.620 --> 00:13:50.980
all of this information
to these tools,

00:13:50.980 --> 00:13:51.980
as well as to people.

00:13:51.980 --> 00:13:55.050
So voice and video communication
to the control

00:13:55.050 --> 00:13:55.960
center is quite important.

00:13:55.960 --> 00:13:57.380
I'm not going to
dwell on that.

00:13:57.380 --> 00:14:01.570
It's not a big part of what I
want to talk about today.

00:14:01.570 --> 00:14:04.120
And yet we've talked about
how time delay

00:14:04.120 --> 00:14:05.590
can make things worse.

00:14:05.590 --> 00:14:07.240
So here is the first of
our little audience

00:14:07.240 --> 00:14:09.240
participation games.

00:14:09.240 --> 00:14:12.030
So I need a volunteer.

00:14:12.030 --> 00:14:14.110
You're my volunteer, great.

00:14:14.110 --> 00:14:15.150
You don't need to go anywhere.

00:14:15.150 --> 00:14:18.690
You can stay there.

00:14:18.690 --> 00:14:22.300
So what we're going to do is
we're going to simulate

00:14:22.300 --> 00:14:25.910
something that might happen on
board a hypothetical future

00:14:25.910 --> 00:14:27.970
space mission with time delay.

00:14:27.970 --> 00:14:30.410
So some blue text is going to
appear on the screen, which I

00:14:30.410 --> 00:14:32.760
will ask you to read
when it appears.

00:14:32.760 --> 00:14:35.260
So perhaps you've made
a phone call.

00:14:35.260 --> 00:14:38.130
So hi, this is ACE
Air Conditioner.

00:14:38.130 --> 00:14:39.380
How can I help you?

00:14:44.510 --> 00:14:46.780
Well, so five seconds
after I say that--

00:14:46.780 --> 00:14:49.720
AUDIENCE: Our A/C hasn't been
working for the last day.

00:14:49.720 --> 00:14:51.170
JEREMY FRANK: You hear it.

00:14:51.170 --> 00:14:52.490
And then you get to
say your piece.

00:14:52.490 --> 00:14:55.520
And five seconds after
that, I hear it.

00:14:59.400 --> 00:15:00.820
When was the last time
that your air

00:15:00.820 --> 00:15:03.401
conditioner was serviced?

00:15:03.401 --> 00:15:05.880
Oh, this is really
frustrating.

00:15:05.880 --> 00:15:07.580
We've haven't even gotten to the
interesting stuff and its

00:15:07.580 --> 00:15:10.424
frustrating.

00:15:10.424 --> 00:15:14.170
AUDIENCE: When you last serviced
it three years ago.

00:15:14.170 --> 00:15:17.040
JEREMY FRANK: I'm twiddling
my thumbs.

00:15:17.040 --> 00:15:21.880
Oh, the tension is mounting.

00:15:21.880 --> 00:15:24.240
Have there been any
interruptions in power?

00:15:24.240 --> 00:15:25.420
OK, so you get the idea.

00:15:25.420 --> 00:15:26.600
So there's one more text box.

00:15:26.600 --> 00:15:31.965
But the point is that if you
were say on your way to QE

00:15:31.965 --> 00:15:35.840
1998, 14 light seconds away,
you're a third the way there,

00:15:35.840 --> 00:15:38.380
five light seconds, and the
air conditioner on your

00:15:38.380 --> 00:15:39.840
spacecraft goes out.

00:15:39.840 --> 00:15:42.300
And you're not entirely sure
what to do about it as an

00:15:42.300 --> 00:15:44.850
astronaut, you might have
that very experience.

00:15:44.850 --> 00:15:47.473
And it's just going to get worse
as you go on to Mars.

00:15:50.570 --> 00:15:52.960
So ever since I started looking
into this time delay

00:15:52.960 --> 00:15:55.620
business, I've been thinking
about how we communicate with

00:15:55.620 --> 00:15:56.550
each other.

00:15:56.550 --> 00:16:00.780
And so I have a very, very brief
and incomplete history

00:16:00.780 --> 00:16:04.430
of how people have communicated,
not going all

00:16:04.430 --> 00:16:05.780
the way back to the Dark Ages.

00:16:05.780 --> 00:16:09.690
But think about if you were
alive in 1860 before the Civil

00:16:09.690 --> 00:16:13.540
War, and you wanted to send a
message to someone, and you

00:16:13.540 --> 00:16:16.800
had to put your message on a
stagecoach that was going

00:16:16.800 --> 00:16:20.060
roughly in the direction of
wherever your friends lived,

00:16:20.060 --> 00:16:21.660
back in the East coast.

00:16:21.660 --> 00:16:24.560
It could take you weeks in order
to send a message, never

00:16:24.560 --> 00:16:27.610
mind if you wanted to get a
message across the ocean.

00:16:27.610 --> 00:16:31.340
So revolutions in communication
like the Pony

00:16:31.340 --> 00:16:35.350
Express in 1861 and the
telegraph and especially the

00:16:35.350 --> 00:16:38.510
transatlantic telegraph, this
just profoundly changed the

00:16:38.510 --> 00:16:40.410
way that we talk
to each other.

00:16:40.410 --> 00:16:43.010
And, of course, we've
lived through the

00:16:43.010 --> 00:16:46.610
revolution in SMS and email.

00:16:46.610 --> 00:16:49.560
We now have devices in our
pockets, that people could not

00:16:49.560 --> 00:16:52.630
have imagined having in their
homes, which allow us to

00:16:52.630 --> 00:16:55.110
pretty much communicate
anything, voice, video, text,

00:16:55.110 --> 00:16:57.280
data, anything we want,
at an instant.

00:16:57.280 --> 00:16:59.310
We're not tied to our
houses anymore.

00:16:59.310 --> 00:17:01.700
So this idea of instantaneous
communication is really

00:17:01.700 --> 00:17:03.900
something quite new.

00:17:03.900 --> 00:17:09.569
And so to some extent, we're
going back to the past if we

00:17:09.569 --> 00:17:12.920
think about what happens when
we send people to very, very

00:17:12.920 --> 00:17:13.890
distant planets.

00:17:13.890 --> 00:17:15.670
We're going to be stuck back
in the dark ages of

00:17:15.670 --> 00:17:17.180
communication again.

00:17:17.180 --> 00:17:22.329
And so of course the human
factors issues of texting from

00:17:22.329 --> 00:17:25.800
the surface of the Moon again
aside, things are going to be

00:17:25.800 --> 00:17:27.050
quite different.

00:17:29.540 --> 00:17:30.990
So that's enough about
communications.

00:17:30.990 --> 00:17:36.280
But really we've been operating
human spacecraft,

00:17:36.280 --> 00:17:39.740
human-occupied spacecraft
for over 50 years now.

00:17:39.740 --> 00:17:41.690
There have been ISS crew
people on board ISS

00:17:41.690 --> 00:17:45.120
continuously for
over a decade.

00:17:45.120 --> 00:17:48.260
Is there really anything
to learn?

00:17:48.260 --> 00:17:51.940
So I want to reinforce
that space is a

00:17:51.940 --> 00:17:54.980
dangerous place, even now.

00:17:54.980 --> 00:17:56.890
Being in space is dangerous.

00:17:56.890 --> 00:17:59.150
Bad things can happen on board
your spacecraft all the time.

00:18:02.520 --> 00:18:05.530
And part of the reason why we
care about this is so that we

00:18:05.530 --> 00:18:07.240
can respond if something
bad happens.

00:18:07.240 --> 00:18:12.320
So almost everybody remembers
that Apollo 13 was a big

00:18:12.320 --> 00:18:15.400
problem during the Apollo era
and that that mission was

00:18:15.400 --> 00:18:17.140
saved by ground.

00:18:17.140 --> 00:18:21.490
It is not widely remembered
that of the other Apollo

00:18:21.490 --> 00:18:26.240
missions, many of them were
saved by timely intervention

00:18:26.240 --> 00:18:28.650
from the ground when something
really bad happened.

00:18:28.650 --> 00:18:33.770
So Apollo 11 I think is one of
the more interesting ones.

00:18:33.770 --> 00:18:37.720
So what this 1202 alarm during
the lunar module descent was--

00:18:37.720 --> 00:18:40.880
basically the Apollo guidance
computer on the lunar module

00:18:40.880 --> 00:18:42.300
was overworked.

00:18:42.300 --> 00:18:44.770
And as a result of its overwork,
it basically started

00:18:44.770 --> 00:18:46.900
issuing these alerts messages.

00:18:46.900 --> 00:18:49.120
And nobody but the engineers who
built it really understood

00:18:49.120 --> 00:18:50.210
what was going on.

00:18:50.210 --> 00:18:51.790
So the crew didn't know if they
were going to have to

00:18:51.790 --> 00:18:54.740
abort this landing or not
until ground told them

00:18:54.740 --> 00:18:56.560
everything's fine.

00:18:56.560 --> 00:18:58.570
You're still safe to land.

00:18:58.570 --> 00:19:00.450
But they didn't know.

00:19:00.450 --> 00:19:02.620
And the others are equally
interesting and I invite you

00:19:02.620 --> 00:19:05.050
to learn more about
them later.

00:19:05.050 --> 00:19:10.100
But unlike in the Apollo era,
flight controllers sitting in

00:19:10.100 --> 00:19:13.460
the control center
fly the ISS.

00:19:13.460 --> 00:19:15.530
The astronauts are up
there to do science.

00:19:15.530 --> 00:19:17.720
The vehicle is flown
from the ground.

00:19:17.720 --> 00:19:20.900
So we don't even have the
experience that they had in

00:19:20.900 --> 00:19:22.980
terms of astronauts owning
and understanding

00:19:22.980 --> 00:19:24.650
how to fly the vehicle.

00:19:24.650 --> 00:19:34.460
So when, for example, you have
a problem on board the

00:19:34.460 --> 00:19:36.400
International Space Station
like a big old tear in the

00:19:36.400 --> 00:19:40.660
solar arrays, ground has
to understand what the

00:19:40.660 --> 00:19:43.840
implications of that and figure
out how to fix it.

00:19:43.840 --> 00:19:47.780
When, for example, a
micrometeorite punches a hole

00:19:47.780 --> 00:19:52.900
in a thermal panel causing it
to blow out, ground has to

00:19:52.900 --> 00:19:56.990
understand how to reroute the
thermal control system and

00:19:56.990 --> 00:19:59.150
keep the vehicle safe.

00:19:59.150 --> 00:20:01.800
When, for instance-- you
won't see it here--

00:20:01.800 --> 00:20:05.980
there is an ammonia leak in the
thermal control system,

00:20:05.980 --> 00:20:08.170
which basically forces you to
shut down a whole power

00:20:08.170 --> 00:20:12.440
channel because you can't keep
it cool anymore, what do you

00:20:12.440 --> 00:20:16.160
do when your station is now
at one eighth less power?

00:20:16.160 --> 00:20:17.960
Ground is taking care
of business.

00:20:17.960 --> 00:20:21.290
Crew can't do that, not today.

00:20:21.290 --> 00:20:24.470
That's why all this time delay
stuff really matters.

00:20:24.470 --> 00:20:28.520
So hopefully I've hammered
all that home.

00:20:28.520 --> 00:20:33.350
So as a result, we understand
that something has to change.

00:20:33.350 --> 00:20:36.030
We can't operate the way that we
usually do in the presence

00:20:36.030 --> 00:20:37.470
of time delay.

00:20:37.470 --> 00:20:40.490
But what exactly can't we do?

00:20:40.490 --> 00:20:45.720
What kind of responsibility
can we shift to the crew?

00:20:45.720 --> 00:20:47.880
What does the ground have to do
differently in the presence

00:20:47.880 --> 00:20:49.970
of time delay for these
future missions?

00:20:49.970 --> 00:20:52.590
So that's really the question
that the work I'm now going to

00:20:52.590 --> 00:20:55.620
talk about is meant to answer.

00:20:55.620 --> 00:20:56.580
So let me pause and ask

00:20:56.580 --> 00:20:57.760
anybody, you got any questions?

00:20:57.760 --> 00:21:00.040
Anybody got anything they
want to know about, any

00:21:00.040 --> 00:21:02.430
observations before we get
into the next bit?

00:21:02.430 --> 00:21:02.928
Yeah?

00:21:02.928 --> 00:21:08.904
AUDIENCE: The near-Earth
asteroids, are there any

00:21:08.904 --> 00:21:11.394
motivations to gather resources
from an asteroid?

00:21:11.394 --> 00:21:13.884
And can you even tell like what
kinds of resources are

00:21:13.884 --> 00:21:16.380
available remotely?

00:21:16.380 --> 00:21:16.580
JEREMY FRANK: Right.

00:21:16.580 --> 00:21:17.180
Great question.

00:21:17.180 --> 00:21:19.200
So the short answer is yes.

00:21:19.200 --> 00:21:21.700
There are a lot of hypotheses
about what kinds of resources

00:21:21.700 --> 00:21:23.670
could be on those asteroids.

00:21:23.670 --> 00:21:26.600
I think the notion of heavy
metals, like gold, and iron,

00:21:26.600 --> 00:21:29.750
and nickel, there are some
asteroids that have those.

00:21:29.750 --> 00:21:32.070
But they tend to be very far
away, at least as far as I

00:21:32.070 --> 00:21:33.240
understand it.

00:21:33.240 --> 00:21:35.850
And so other kinds of
resources people are

00:21:35.850 --> 00:21:38.230
interested in are things
like radioactives.

00:21:38.230 --> 00:21:39.410
People think that, for
instance, there are

00:21:39.410 --> 00:21:41.730
radioactives is on the Moon
that might be mined.

00:21:41.730 --> 00:21:45.990
But it's very difficult to get
a good sense of what's

00:21:45.990 --> 00:21:48.220
underneath an asteroid.

00:21:48.220 --> 00:21:50.200
If there's something that's on
the surface, you might be able

00:21:50.200 --> 00:21:52.420
to observe its spectra with a
telescope from the ground or a

00:21:52.420 --> 00:21:53.890
space-based telescope.

00:21:53.890 --> 00:21:56.180
But hard to find out
what's inside.

00:21:56.180 --> 00:21:58.940
And I think that nobody should
get too excited about us being

00:21:58.940 --> 00:22:01.220
able to mine asteroids
in the near term.

00:22:01.220 --> 00:22:02.430
It's a very exciting idea.

00:22:02.430 --> 00:22:04.850
But we can hardly even get there
in the first place, let

00:22:04.850 --> 00:22:07.680
alone bring stuff back.

00:22:07.680 --> 00:22:08.050
Yeah?

00:22:08.050 --> 00:22:09.834
AUDIENCE: Do you think crew
obviously also mean the

00:22:09.834 --> 00:22:13.690
on-board computers, which given
what you said so far,

00:22:13.690 --> 00:22:18.396
seem to be needing to take
on a large part of the

00:22:18.396 --> 00:22:19.890
responsibility.

00:22:19.890 --> 00:22:20.390
JEREMY FRANK: That's right.

00:22:20.390 --> 00:22:22.680
So we distinguish
between vehicle

00:22:22.680 --> 00:22:24.740
automation and crew autonomy.

00:22:24.740 --> 00:22:27.480
So things like computers taking
action and being able

00:22:27.480 --> 00:22:30.780
to control systems, we would
tend to refer to that as

00:22:30.780 --> 00:22:32.075
automation in some way,
shape, or form.

00:22:32.075 --> 00:22:33.300
And you're absolutely right.

00:22:33.300 --> 00:22:34.930
One of the things that we think
we're going to have to

00:22:34.930 --> 00:22:38.340
do is make the computers able to
do more or different tasks

00:22:38.340 --> 00:22:39.750
than they do today.

00:22:39.750 --> 00:22:42.280
There are questions about how
effective that can be.

00:22:42.280 --> 00:22:43.220
Can it be trusted?

00:22:43.220 --> 00:22:44.220
Is it complex?

00:22:44.220 --> 00:22:45.570
Is it too expensive?

00:22:45.570 --> 00:22:48.430
But many of those same questions
apply to shifting

00:22:48.430 --> 00:22:49.680
responsibility to the crew.

00:22:53.220 --> 00:22:54.660
Nobody else?

00:22:54.660 --> 00:22:56.970
OK.

00:22:56.970 --> 00:23:00.290
So far, so good.

00:23:00.290 --> 00:23:01.010
So we're NASA.

00:23:01.010 --> 00:23:04.130
So we can do all sorts of very,
very interesting things.

00:23:04.130 --> 00:23:06.080
So in order to answer this
question, we decided that we

00:23:06.080 --> 00:23:07.870
were going to build ourselves
a spacecraft.

00:23:07.870 --> 00:23:10.210
And we were going to send it
someplace really far away,

00:23:10.210 --> 00:23:11.340
like Texas.

00:23:11.340 --> 00:23:13.740
And we were then going to
operate it under a variety of

00:23:13.740 --> 00:23:17.230
these conditions in order to
simulate the time delays,

00:23:17.230 --> 00:23:19.310
simulate the kinds of activities
that we think would

00:23:19.310 --> 00:23:22.490
happen on such mission, try and
introduce some of these

00:23:22.490 --> 00:23:27.830
unexpected events, and produce
a set of sort of impact

00:23:27.830 --> 00:23:29.760
assessment of what
would happen.

00:23:29.760 --> 00:23:31.790
And then we have some of these
mitigation technologies that

00:23:31.790 --> 00:23:32.810
people have been
thinking about.

00:23:32.810 --> 00:23:35.460
So we wanted to experiment with
those under basically the

00:23:35.460 --> 00:23:39.290
same experimental conditions and
see what worked and what

00:23:39.290 --> 00:23:43.414
didn't work before we
do it for real.

00:23:43.414 --> 00:23:45.830
So here you are.

00:23:45.830 --> 00:23:47.170
You don't want to see that
when your on board your

00:23:47.170 --> 00:23:48.680
spacecraft.

00:23:48.680 --> 00:23:52.150
So I'm not entirely joking when
I said that NASA built

00:23:52.150 --> 00:23:53.920
the spacecraft.

00:23:53.920 --> 00:23:56.480
We didn't build it to fly
in space, unfortunately.

00:23:56.480 --> 00:24:03.290
But the Deep Space Habitat
spacecraft test facility that

00:24:03.290 --> 00:24:05.770
we used here was built at
Johnson Space Center.

00:24:05.770 --> 00:24:07.940
And its whole purpose in life
was to do this class of

00:24:07.940 --> 00:24:10.880
experiment, to basically serve
as an analog so that you could

00:24:10.880 --> 00:24:14.110
do these kinds of operational
tests, try out a variety of

00:24:14.110 --> 00:24:16.840
advanced technologies, in order
to see what does and

00:24:16.840 --> 00:24:20.410
does not work for these
future missions.

00:24:20.410 --> 00:24:25.290
And so in addition to that,
mission control in Johnson

00:24:25.290 --> 00:24:29.230
Space Center has a similar
facility, the operations

00:24:29.230 --> 00:24:32.370
technology facility, where
they test operations

00:24:32.370 --> 00:24:35.730
technologies for use on future
and also on current

00:24:35.730 --> 00:24:36.820
spacecraft.

00:24:36.820 --> 00:24:39.650
So they kindly lent us some
space that we could use to

00:24:39.650 --> 00:24:42.100
create a mini-control center
in order to operate

00:24:42.100 --> 00:24:43.430
the Deep Space Hab.

00:24:43.430 --> 00:24:46.120
And so that's our
test harness.

00:24:46.120 --> 00:24:49.400
And so what I'm going to do now
is I'll tell you a little

00:24:49.400 --> 00:24:51.930
bit about the sort of miniature

00:24:51.930 --> 00:24:53.720
mission that we created.

00:24:53.720 --> 00:24:56.520
And I'll go through its mission
timeline a little bit.

00:24:56.520 --> 00:24:59.800
And then I'll describe the
mitigation technologies that

00:24:59.800 --> 00:25:02.450
we used to try and see what
happened with time delay.

00:25:02.450 --> 00:25:08.660
So what we had was a crew of
four quote, quote "astronauts"

00:25:08.660 --> 00:25:11.730
in our spacecraft, one of whom
actually was an astronaut.

00:25:11.730 --> 00:25:14.950
And then we had a set of flight
control positions, with

00:25:14.950 --> 00:25:17.320
responsibilities like those
things that I described.

00:25:17.320 --> 00:25:19.220
So we had a power systems flight
controller, thermal

00:25:19.220 --> 00:25:22.880
systems, chief medical officer,
operations planning,

00:25:22.880 --> 00:25:24.330
and so on and so forth.

00:25:24.330 --> 00:25:26.460
And these people basically
conducted these simulated

00:25:26.460 --> 00:25:28.500
two-hour mission timelines.

00:25:28.500 --> 00:25:31.950
And here is our mission
timeline.

00:25:31.950 --> 00:25:35.370
So what I'll do is go through
a subset of these activities

00:25:35.370 --> 00:25:36.760
and describe what they are.

00:25:36.760 --> 00:25:40.180
But this is the kind of thing
that you would expect to see

00:25:40.180 --> 00:25:43.550
during a part of the mission
where there's no vehicle

00:25:43.550 --> 00:25:46.460
docking, there's no vehicle
undocking, there's nobody

00:25:46.460 --> 00:25:49.050
going outside on an
extravehicular activity.

00:25:49.050 --> 00:25:51.510
People are basically staying
inside the spacecraft, living

00:25:51.510 --> 00:25:53.470
and working, taking
care of business.

00:25:53.470 --> 00:25:57.830
Not exactly doing the laundry,
but doing things that are sort

00:25:57.830 --> 00:26:02.280
of regular, recurring tasks
that are, if you like,

00:26:02.280 --> 00:26:04.110
important, but not
sort of highly

00:26:04.110 --> 00:26:06.350
dynamic, energetic events.

00:26:06.350 --> 00:26:08.590
And so let's walk through the
timeline and see what some of

00:26:08.590 --> 00:26:11.880
these activities are in a
little bit more detail.

00:26:11.880 --> 00:26:15.920
So one thing that happens
a fair amount with your

00:26:15.920 --> 00:26:19.490
mechanical equipment on board
the spacecraft is you need to

00:26:19.490 --> 00:26:21.040
inspect it frequently to
make sure that it's

00:26:21.040 --> 00:26:22.710
still working properly.

00:26:22.710 --> 00:26:24.760
This is a piece of exercise
equipment.

00:26:24.760 --> 00:26:27.360
It's very important for the
crew exercise, to maintain

00:26:27.360 --> 00:26:29.760
bone and muscle mass inside
zero gravity.

00:26:29.760 --> 00:26:33.190
But all that mechanical
equipment can wear out.

00:26:33.190 --> 00:26:35.160
You definitely don't want it
breaking while a crew person

00:26:35.160 --> 00:26:36.720
is exercising with it.

00:26:36.720 --> 00:26:39.210
So you conduct inspections
periodically to make sure it's

00:26:39.210 --> 00:26:40.400
working right.

00:26:40.400 --> 00:26:41.780
You send pictures back
to the ground.

00:26:41.780 --> 00:26:43.620
Ground does an inspection,
makes sure everything is

00:26:43.620 --> 00:26:44.870
working OK.

00:26:47.340 --> 00:26:50.920
Part of the hypothesis for these
long duration missions

00:26:50.920 --> 00:26:54.170
of the future is that perhaps
we can use plants, both as

00:26:54.170 --> 00:26:57.070
sources of food and also
environmental control.

00:26:57.070 --> 00:27:00.320
So we pretended that we
had plants on board.

00:27:00.320 --> 00:27:02.570
So there's a regular soil
sampling activity to make sure

00:27:02.570 --> 00:27:03.820
that the plants are
staying healthy.

00:27:07.570 --> 00:27:09.890
Just like at home, if your air
conditioner filter doesn't get

00:27:09.890 --> 00:27:11.960
replaced, your A/C doesn't
work very well.

00:27:11.960 --> 00:27:13.300
So we had a simulated
air conditioner

00:27:13.300 --> 00:27:15.680
filter replacement activity.

00:27:15.680 --> 00:27:18.420
In addition, we assumed that we
were on our way back from

00:27:18.420 --> 00:27:21.330
some planetary destination where
we collected a number of

00:27:21.330 --> 00:27:24.020
samples, rock and
soil samples.

00:27:24.020 --> 00:27:26.230
So there's the sample inventory
activity to make

00:27:26.230 --> 00:27:29.330
sure that those samples'
condition and placement is

00:27:29.330 --> 00:27:30.580
well understood.

00:27:32.830 --> 00:27:37.050
So you remember the
micrometeorite strike on ISS?

00:27:37.050 --> 00:27:39.810
Well, so every so often you may
need to conduct some sort

00:27:39.810 --> 00:27:43.540
of external inspection of part
of your vehicle with a camera

00:27:43.540 --> 00:27:46.320
that's mounted outside, that can
take pictures to make sure

00:27:46.320 --> 00:27:48.600
that the outside of
your spacecraft

00:27:48.600 --> 00:27:50.220
is looking all right.

00:27:50.220 --> 00:27:53.700
And then the last one is a
fluid transfer activity.

00:27:53.700 --> 00:27:57.400
So there are various
repositories of fluid.

00:27:57.400 --> 00:28:00.630
It can either be fuel, sometimes
it could be water,

00:28:00.630 --> 00:28:02.160
waste perhaps.

00:28:02.160 --> 00:28:04.300
And so every so often, you may
need to move fluid from one

00:28:04.300 --> 00:28:05.560
place to another.

00:28:05.560 --> 00:28:08.590
And so that's another common
activity that people had.

00:28:08.590 --> 00:28:12.450
So we had about a dozen
of these activities.

00:28:12.450 --> 00:28:14.970
And we had a full timeline.

00:28:14.970 --> 00:28:18.170
So really in that two hours,
there wasn't a whole lot of

00:28:18.170 --> 00:28:20.890
time for anything to go wrong.

00:28:20.890 --> 00:28:22.900
There wasn't a whole lot of time
for activities to take

00:28:22.900 --> 00:28:25.020
longer than expected either.

00:28:25.020 --> 00:28:28.890
And so what we wanted to do
also was to disrupt the

00:28:28.890 --> 00:28:31.430
timeline with a variety
of unexpected events.

00:28:31.430 --> 00:28:34.350
So we had a pretty rich power
system inside the Deep Space

00:28:34.350 --> 00:28:37.450
Hab and we were able to
selectively fail components.

00:28:37.450 --> 00:28:41.460
So as you'll see later, there's
power distribution,

00:28:41.460 --> 00:28:44.960
power conversion, and a variety
of other pieces of the

00:28:44.960 --> 00:28:47.240
power system which
we could decide

00:28:47.240 --> 00:28:49.260
weren't working properly.

00:28:49.260 --> 00:28:51.280
Sometimes they decided they
weren't working properly all

00:28:51.280 --> 00:28:53.470
by themselves, which was
kind of exciting.

00:28:53.470 --> 00:28:53.780
I'm sorry.

00:28:53.780 --> 00:28:54.610
Did you have a question?

00:28:54.610 --> 00:28:57.574
AUDIENCE: Were either the crew
or the simulated mission

00:28:57.574 --> 00:28:59.550
control notified in advance
what failures

00:28:59.550 --> 00:29:00.510
you're going to run?

00:29:00.510 --> 00:29:02.246
JEREMY FRANK: No.

00:29:02.246 --> 00:29:03.550
No.

00:29:03.550 --> 00:29:06.260
There's an extensive experiment
design that I'm not

00:29:06.260 --> 00:29:07.150
going to really get into.

00:29:07.150 --> 00:29:10.100
But no, we wanted very much
to keep that secret.

00:29:10.100 --> 00:29:12.700
So we had a set of people
working those failures up,

00:29:12.700 --> 00:29:15.570
making sure that we had good,
reasonable failures that

00:29:15.570 --> 00:29:18.070
actually could disrupt the
timeline, but we're going to

00:29:18.070 --> 00:29:20.350
totally blow us out
of the water.

00:29:20.350 --> 00:29:22.480
And in fact, there's lots of
good insight about that that

00:29:22.480 --> 00:29:24.330
we can discuss a little
bit later.

00:29:24.330 --> 00:29:28.010
So the fluid system was a
software fluid simulation.

00:29:28.010 --> 00:29:30.300
We thought about using a
hardware simulation, decided

00:29:30.300 --> 00:29:31.440
not to do that.

00:29:31.440 --> 00:29:33.750
So with the software fluid-based
simulation, we do

00:29:33.750 --> 00:29:36.520
just about anything we wanted.

00:29:36.520 --> 00:29:38.100
So that was very good.

00:29:38.100 --> 00:29:40.440
And we were exceedingly lucky.

00:29:40.440 --> 00:29:42.680
We were able to work with some
people at Johnson Space Center

00:29:42.680 --> 00:29:49.320
in space medicine, both
certified ultrasound

00:29:49.320 --> 00:29:53.110
technicians and also some
very, very cool medical

00:29:53.110 --> 00:29:55.010
autonomous operations
technology.

00:29:55.010 --> 00:29:56.090
So they partnered with us.

00:29:56.090 --> 00:29:58.910
And we were able to do crew
medical emergencies, in which

00:29:58.910 --> 00:30:02.570
case either urinary retention
or kidney stone actually

00:30:02.570 --> 00:30:06.480
present with very similar
symptoms and both of them are

00:30:06.480 --> 00:30:08.500
diagnosed using ultrasounds.

00:30:08.500 --> 00:30:11.360
And so that was a great
ambiguous crew down, medical

00:30:11.360 --> 00:30:12.860
emergency situation.

00:30:12.860 --> 00:30:14.500
We were able to perform
the ultrasound.

00:30:14.500 --> 00:30:16.380
We weren't able to do anything
after the ultrasound.

00:30:16.380 --> 00:30:18.370
But even that was pretty cool.

00:30:18.370 --> 00:30:20.510
Some of our flight controllers
got to do ultrasounds for the

00:30:20.510 --> 00:30:20.950
first time.

00:30:20.950 --> 00:30:22.200
That was pretty exciting.

00:30:24.380 --> 00:30:30.400
So that gives us a pretty
interesting set of things that

00:30:30.400 --> 00:30:35.750
we can introduce in order
to disrupt our timeline.

00:30:35.750 --> 00:30:36.340
So here we are.

00:30:36.340 --> 00:30:38.000
Here's our poor, hapless flight
controller doing his

00:30:38.000 --> 00:30:39.250
ultrasound.

00:30:42.260 --> 00:30:44.310
OK.

00:30:44.310 --> 00:30:45.760
So we had four distinct crews.

00:30:45.760 --> 00:30:48.320
And it was very important to us
to have distinct crews so

00:30:48.320 --> 00:30:51.180
that basically crews couldn't
sort of gain experience in the

00:30:51.180 --> 00:30:52.980
experiment design.

00:30:52.980 --> 00:30:54.210
And that was really
tremendous.

00:30:54.210 --> 00:30:56.510
We got volunteer astronauts
in order to serve as our

00:30:56.510 --> 00:30:57.380
commanders.

00:30:57.380 --> 00:30:59.990
But all of our crews and flight
controllers were either

00:30:59.990 --> 00:31:02.970
certified flight controllers
from the International Space

00:31:02.970 --> 00:31:04.540
Station or shuttle program.

00:31:04.540 --> 00:31:07.570
So when you hear the results of
what these experiments are

00:31:07.570 --> 00:31:08.670
telling you, keep
this in mind.

00:31:08.670 --> 00:31:10.630
Because these are the experts,
the people who actually do

00:31:10.630 --> 00:31:12.970
this every single day, telling
us what did and didn't work.

00:31:12.970 --> 00:31:14.670
And that was very, very
valuable to us.

00:31:19.510 --> 00:31:23.770
So I'm just going to skip this
because I think I want to make

00:31:23.770 --> 00:31:25.656
up a little bit of time here.

00:31:25.656 --> 00:31:29.080
Oh, I'm actually doing great.

00:31:29.080 --> 00:31:32.980
So we essentially took all of
those situations, either

00:31:32.980 --> 00:31:35.270
nothing happens, we disrupt
things with system failures,

00:31:35.270 --> 00:31:37.170
we disrupt them with crew
medical emergencies, these

00:31:37.170 --> 00:31:40.030
time delays that we wanted
to experiment with.

00:31:40.030 --> 00:31:43.100
And we said, let's pretend we
were doing basically the way

00:31:43.100 --> 00:31:47.070
ISS is operated today, see what
happens, try and get sort

00:31:47.070 --> 00:31:49.950
of a baseline what's the impact
of time delay under

00:31:49.950 --> 00:31:51.650
these circumstances?

00:31:51.650 --> 00:31:53.960
And then let's take some things
that we think are going

00:31:53.960 --> 00:31:58.220
to make delayed operations a
little bit less painful and

00:31:58.220 --> 00:32:00.610
compare them point by point and
see if we can get a sense

00:32:00.610 --> 00:32:03.530
of whether things are made
better and if so how and why.

00:32:03.530 --> 00:32:07.550
So let's talk a little bit about
what some of these are.

00:32:07.550 --> 00:32:10.070
So you remember, we talked a
little bit our procedures, the

00:32:10.070 --> 00:32:13.220
step by step instructions that
tell people what to do, and

00:32:13.220 --> 00:32:14.790
where to go, and what
pieces of equipment

00:32:14.790 --> 00:32:15.740
they're going to use.

00:32:15.740 --> 00:32:20.140
Well, today those are mostly
electronic documents

00:32:20.140 --> 00:32:21.950
presented as PDFs.

00:32:21.950 --> 00:32:24.930
But if you're going to send a
command, and the procedure

00:32:24.930 --> 00:32:27.640
tells you to send a command, you
got to go to some new tool

00:32:27.640 --> 00:32:28.760
to send the command.

00:32:28.760 --> 00:32:30.870
If you need to refer to a
piece of data and decide

00:32:30.870 --> 00:32:33.290
whether to do the next step or
not, you have to go to another

00:32:33.290 --> 00:32:34.800
tool in order to see that.

00:32:34.800 --> 00:32:38.180
So an advanced electronic
procedure display allows you

00:32:38.180 --> 00:32:42.150
to send commands, renders your
telemetry, and tells you

00:32:42.150 --> 00:32:44.460
whether or not you've got a
problem with the next step.

00:32:44.460 --> 00:32:47.120
So we see here this piece of
telemetry in this yellow box.

00:32:47.120 --> 00:32:48.910
Well, that's telling you, if you
get to that step and that

00:32:48.910 --> 00:32:52.430
box is still yellow, you can't
do that command yet.

00:32:52.430 --> 00:32:54.270
You can see which procedures
are active.

00:32:54.270 --> 00:32:56.430
You can see we've procedures
are done.

00:32:56.430 --> 00:32:59.550
If other pieces of technology
are recommending procedures,

00:32:59.550 --> 00:33:01.060
you see those.

00:33:01.060 --> 00:33:04.070
You have step tracking and all
kinds of other very cool

00:33:04.070 --> 00:33:05.390
advanced features.

00:33:05.390 --> 00:33:08.080
So this is one thing that's sort
of a step above today's

00:33:08.080 --> 00:33:11.250
practice in terms of operations
technology.

00:33:11.250 --> 00:33:12.830
Both crews and flight
controllers

00:33:12.830 --> 00:33:14.550
can make use of this.

00:33:14.550 --> 00:33:16.190
Primarily, this was for
the crew's use in

00:33:16.190 --> 00:33:19.190
our experiments though.

00:33:19.190 --> 00:33:21.410
So you have the great question
about our software going to

00:33:21.410 --> 00:33:22.150
make us smarter?

00:33:22.150 --> 00:33:23.365
Is it going to do more?

00:33:23.365 --> 00:33:25.330
Well, one of the things it can
do is it can tell us whether

00:33:25.330 --> 00:33:26.680
we have a problem.

00:33:26.680 --> 00:33:28.130
It can diagnose problems.

00:33:28.130 --> 00:33:30.640
It can tell us what the
consequences of problems are.

00:33:30.640 --> 00:33:32.130
It can tell us well, I know
there's a problem.

00:33:32.130 --> 00:33:33.210
Maybe there's an ambiguity.

00:33:33.210 --> 00:33:34.950
I can recommend something
to disambiguate

00:33:34.950 --> 00:33:36.280
what the problem is.

00:33:36.280 --> 00:33:39.140
So here's a somewhat hard
to see, schematic

00:33:39.140 --> 00:33:40.540
of the power system.

00:33:40.540 --> 00:33:44.910
But what we're seeing here is
that a 24-volt DC converter

00:33:44.910 --> 00:33:46.800
has failed.

00:33:46.800 --> 00:33:49.330
So that's what the solid
red box indicates.

00:33:49.330 --> 00:33:51.880
As a consequence, all these
things that are kind of dimly

00:33:51.880 --> 00:33:54.970
visible in this outlined red
box, those are components that

00:33:54.970 --> 00:33:57.960
have been taken down as a
result of that failure.

00:33:57.960 --> 00:34:02.380
So this is a combined schematic
of your system, with

00:34:02.380 --> 00:34:04.890
a piece of software living
behind it that is trying to do

00:34:04.890 --> 00:34:06.970
that advance caution and
warning, fault detection,

00:34:06.970 --> 00:34:09.750
isolation, and recovery
technology task.

00:34:09.750 --> 00:34:11.790
So again, this is the kind of
thing that could be available

00:34:11.790 --> 00:34:15.050
on board if the computational
resources are available.

00:34:15.050 --> 00:34:17.262
It could also be used inside
the flight control room.

00:34:20.219 --> 00:34:23.820
So in addition to those things,

00:34:23.820 --> 00:34:26.280
something a little simpler.

00:34:26.280 --> 00:34:30.100
Why don't the astronauts chat?

00:34:30.100 --> 00:34:32.600
Why not give them chat?

00:34:32.600 --> 00:34:33.980
So that was a pretty
obvious one.

00:34:33.980 --> 00:34:37.090
In fact, there should be an
experiment on board ISS with

00:34:37.090 --> 00:34:40.980
chat now, partially driven by
what we did during this

00:34:40.980 --> 00:34:44.469
experiment a couple years ago.

00:34:44.469 --> 00:34:48.650
So in order to create these
mitigation technologies, we

00:34:48.650 --> 00:34:52.130
put together a gigantic list of

00:34:52.130 --> 00:34:53.900
components under the covers.

00:34:53.900 --> 00:34:56.010
One of the things that I want
to draw attention to is over

00:34:56.010 --> 00:34:59.260
here on the protocol side, not
only are these protocols for

00:34:59.260 --> 00:35:02.040
basically moving information
around, both within our

00:35:02.040 --> 00:35:05.200
simulated spacecraft and also
inside our simulated flight

00:35:05.200 --> 00:35:07.910
control room, this was also
what we used in order to

00:35:07.910 --> 00:35:09.810
simulate the time delay.

00:35:09.810 --> 00:35:15.100
Voice, video, data, audio, all
of them were actually put into

00:35:15.100 --> 00:35:16.300
simulated time delay loops.

00:35:16.300 --> 00:35:18.140
And this was part of the
way that we did it.

00:35:18.140 --> 00:35:21.380
So you can make me look dumb by
asking me questions about

00:35:21.380 --> 00:35:23.380
this since this is not really
my expertise area.

00:35:23.380 --> 00:35:26.540
But But this is just a
small subset of the

00:35:26.540 --> 00:35:27.790
things that we used.

00:35:31.050 --> 00:35:32.070
So any questions about that?

00:35:32.070 --> 00:35:35.150
I kind of flew through it pretty
quickly, but before we

00:35:35.150 --> 00:35:37.768
get on into what we learned?

00:35:37.768 --> 00:35:38.720
Yeah?

00:35:38.720 --> 00:35:42.052
AUDIENCE: You mentioned kind
of the advance electronic

00:35:42.052 --> 00:35:44.270
document sort of
thing, so PDFs.

00:35:44.270 --> 00:35:46.830
One of the side effects
of that, though--

00:35:46.830 --> 00:35:50.273
I mean is that the only control
mechanism that someone

00:35:50.273 --> 00:35:53.638
would have or is that in
addition to that extra tool

00:35:53.638 --> 00:35:54.430
that you described?

00:35:54.430 --> 00:35:54.910
JEREMY FRANK: Right.

00:35:54.910 --> 00:35:55.560
Good question.

00:35:55.560 --> 00:35:58.920
So even today, procedures are
always backed up by single

00:35:58.920 --> 00:36:01.900
command displays where you can
issue individual commands.

00:36:01.900 --> 00:36:03.970
Because no battle plan
ever survives

00:36:03.970 --> 00:36:04.890
contact with the enemy.

00:36:04.890 --> 00:36:08.430
No procedure survives contact
with the real situation.

00:36:08.430 --> 00:36:10.730
So in the event that you sort of
wandered outside the bounds

00:36:10.730 --> 00:36:13.360
of what you know how to do, you
always need another way to

00:36:13.360 --> 00:36:15.150
command the system and
to get the insight.

00:36:21.820 --> 00:36:24.300
So in terms of measurement,
how do we actually measure

00:36:24.300 --> 00:36:25.420
what happened?

00:36:25.420 --> 00:36:28.520
So there are a variety of
questionnaires that people

00:36:28.520 --> 00:36:30.900
have developed over the years in
order to assess things like

00:36:30.900 --> 00:36:33.950
what is a person's workload,
what is the difficulty of

00:36:33.950 --> 00:36:36.350
communication coordination,
and things like that.

00:36:36.350 --> 00:36:38.550
We could also take metric
measurements of things like

00:36:38.550 --> 00:36:41.520
how often did people talk,
how long did people talk.

00:36:41.520 --> 00:36:43.640
And those are the kinds of
things that we were able to

00:36:43.640 --> 00:36:47.090
use in order to figure
out whether things

00:36:47.090 --> 00:36:48.920
became harder or easier.

00:36:48.920 --> 00:36:50.400
You might ask well, could
you count the

00:36:50.400 --> 00:36:51.490
number of tasks performed?

00:36:51.490 --> 00:36:52.620
Could you count the number
of procedure

00:36:52.620 --> 00:36:53.870
steps and their delays?

00:36:53.870 --> 00:36:55.560
We did that and we
saw no impact.

00:36:55.560 --> 00:36:57.340
So I'm not to say anything
more about that.

00:36:57.340 --> 00:37:02.650
But audience participation
opportunity number two.

00:37:02.650 --> 00:37:04.200
So what do you think?

00:37:04.200 --> 00:37:06.750
Based on this experiment, based
on what you've heard, do

00:37:06.750 --> 00:37:09.050
you think the time delay is
going to make things harder or

00:37:09.050 --> 00:37:12.470
easier, just curious?

00:37:12.470 --> 00:37:15.540
Show of hands if you think
it's going to be harder.

00:37:15.540 --> 00:37:17.280
Almost everybody thinks it's
going to be harder.

00:37:20.030 --> 00:37:23.330
So without knowing anything
more than I've said about

00:37:23.330 --> 00:37:25.200
these mitigation technologies,
do you think they're going to

00:37:25.200 --> 00:37:26.920
make things better?

00:37:26.920 --> 00:37:30.180
Show of hands if they're
going to be better.

00:37:30.180 --> 00:37:31.490
Some people, a little bit.

00:37:31.490 --> 00:37:32.110
AUDIENCE: Harder to identify.

00:37:32.110 --> 00:37:34.070
JEREMY FRANK: Anybody think
it's going to be worse?

00:37:34.070 --> 00:37:35.810
Is this going to cause damage?

00:37:35.810 --> 00:37:37.415
Are we going to mess this up?

00:37:37.415 --> 00:37:39.040
No, OK.

00:37:39.040 --> 00:37:39.620
All right.

00:37:39.620 --> 00:37:40.750
AUDIENCE: What did you think?

00:37:40.750 --> 00:37:41.626
JEREMY FRANK: Pardon?

00:37:41.626 --> 00:37:43.100
AUDIENCE: What did you think?

00:37:43.100 --> 00:37:44.250
JEREMY FRANK: We really
didn't know.

00:37:44.250 --> 00:37:46.480
We formulated this hypothesis
that things

00:37:46.480 --> 00:37:48.830
were going to be different.

00:37:48.830 --> 00:37:51.490
Things did not turn out quite
the way we expected though.

00:37:51.490 --> 00:37:53.280
We didn't really have
a good sense of what

00:37:53.280 --> 00:37:55.500
was going to happen.

00:37:55.500 --> 00:37:56.920
So I apologize.

00:37:56.920 --> 00:37:58.230
There's some quantitative
data here.

00:38:01.480 --> 00:38:04.050
We ran a total of 10 experiments
at each time delay

00:38:04.050 --> 00:38:06.890
setting, 10 at 50, 10 at 300.

00:38:06.890 --> 00:38:12.390
So this is what the crew members
said they thought how

00:38:12.390 --> 00:38:14.380
workload changed with
time delay.

00:38:14.380 --> 00:38:16.570
So the crew thought workload
was higher at

00:38:16.570 --> 00:38:17.820
the higher time delay.

00:38:20.740 --> 00:38:24.410
The crew thought workload went
down when we added those

00:38:24.410 --> 00:38:27.570
mitigation technologies.

00:38:27.570 --> 00:38:29.980
We did not expect that.

00:38:29.980 --> 00:38:33.650
We expected something like well,
it'll increase with time

00:38:33.650 --> 00:38:35.940
delay, but it'll be less.

00:38:35.940 --> 00:38:38.970
We didn't expect workload
to actually decrease.

00:38:38.970 --> 00:38:40.000
That was a surprise.

00:38:40.000 --> 00:38:41.250
We didn't understand that.

00:38:44.660 --> 00:38:46.070
This is more like what
we expected.

00:38:46.070 --> 00:38:48.030
So this is what the flight
control team said.

00:38:48.030 --> 00:38:51.070
So the flight controller said
well, time delay is making

00:38:51.070 --> 00:38:51.820
things harder.

00:38:51.820 --> 00:38:54.190
But the mitigations are
making things easier.

00:38:54.190 --> 00:38:56.480
But it's making it easier
across the board.

00:38:56.480 --> 00:38:57.240
So that was interesting.

00:38:57.240 --> 00:38:58.760
So we got some surprises
right away.

00:39:02.970 --> 00:39:05.440
OK, so this in words
is pretty much what

00:39:05.440 --> 00:39:06.980
the charts are showing.

00:39:06.980 --> 00:39:07.780
So that was interesting.

00:39:07.780 --> 00:39:09.560
So we have statistical
significance tests.

00:39:09.560 --> 00:39:11.990
And yeah, most of this looks
like it's actually real.

00:39:11.990 --> 00:39:14.400
The variances are a little
bit high, but it's

00:39:14.400 --> 00:39:16.450
actually a real effect.

00:39:16.450 --> 00:39:19.130
So just looking at that though,

00:39:19.130 --> 00:39:20.080
that's not quite enough.

00:39:20.080 --> 00:39:23.260
Because that's only telling us
sort of grossly speaking what

00:39:23.260 --> 00:39:27.060
people's experience was in
sort of metric terms.

00:39:27.060 --> 00:39:30.920
But in addition to these sort of
numerical measurements, we

00:39:30.920 --> 00:39:35.050
also got hem or to
answer questions.

00:39:35.050 --> 00:39:38.540
And what they told us in words
about what did and didn't work

00:39:38.540 --> 00:39:42.230
and why it didn't work was
really interesting.

00:39:42.230 --> 00:39:44.040
So here's one example.

00:39:44.040 --> 00:39:45.780
And I have a lot of these
in the charts.

00:39:45.780 --> 00:39:47.590
And I don't know if I'm going
to go through them all.

00:39:47.590 --> 00:39:49.900
But what are they saying?

00:39:49.900 --> 00:39:55.630
So this second quote is
especially interesting.

00:39:55.630 --> 00:39:58.090
To keep from falling behind,
while I was waiting for the

00:39:58.090 --> 00:40:01.280
ground to tell me the answer
to a question, I started

00:40:01.280 --> 00:40:03.170
something else.

00:40:03.170 --> 00:40:04.670
So what are they doing?

00:40:04.670 --> 00:40:05.860
They're getting ahead.

00:40:05.860 --> 00:40:08.010
But in doing so, they're
imposing workload on

00:40:08.010 --> 00:40:10.790
themselves to keep track
of what tasks

00:40:10.790 --> 00:40:12.420
they're currently doing.

00:40:12.420 --> 00:40:13.610
So they're trying
to multitask.

00:40:13.610 --> 00:40:15.720
They're trying to do multiple
things at once.

00:40:15.720 --> 00:40:16.970
And it's making it harder.

00:40:22.520 --> 00:40:24.110
What else are they doing?

00:40:24.110 --> 00:40:27.960
Oh, when they ask a question
and they're not getting an

00:40:27.960 --> 00:40:31.330
immediate response, they're
creating work because now they

00:40:31.330 --> 00:40:35.530
have to monitor the auditory
channel for the come-back.

00:40:35.530 --> 00:40:37.670
So even if they had a
timer, they would

00:40:37.670 --> 00:40:38.970
still have to be listening.

00:40:38.970 --> 00:40:40.420
Oh, it's about time for
them for them to

00:40:40.420 --> 00:40:41.910
get back to me now.

00:40:41.910 --> 00:40:43.190
So they're creating work.

00:40:48.440 --> 00:40:50.660
This one was also very
interesting.

00:40:50.660 --> 00:40:53.590
I had to write things down
because I wasn't sure I was

00:40:53.590 --> 00:40:56.000
going to remember what
question I asked.

00:40:56.000 --> 00:40:59.210
If I got to "say again," which
could happen, communications

00:40:59.210 --> 00:41:01.580
get garbled all the time.

00:41:01.580 --> 00:41:03.370
So these things are things
that they're doing.

00:41:03.370 --> 00:41:05.140
This is what they're
experiencing in a time delay

00:41:05.140 --> 00:41:06.870
that's creating work.

00:41:06.870 --> 00:41:07.740
So this is great.

00:41:07.740 --> 00:41:08.870
This is solid gold.

00:41:08.870 --> 00:41:10.640
This is exactly what
you need to know.

00:41:16.140 --> 00:41:19.890
So luckily we had very clever
people who had questionnaires

00:41:19.890 --> 00:41:23.100
prepared in order to assess the
coordination difficulty,

00:41:23.100 --> 00:41:24.180
which is one of the
things that's

00:41:24.180 --> 00:41:26.190
creating this extra work.

00:41:26.190 --> 00:41:29.070
So things like tracking tasks
that I've started at the same

00:41:29.070 --> 00:41:30.810
time, that's one thing.

00:41:30.810 --> 00:41:32.650
But this-- how hard is
it to talk to people?

00:41:32.650 --> 00:41:35.810
Is it hard to talk to people
between crew and ground?

00:41:35.810 --> 00:41:38.220
So we had some questionnaires
for that.

00:41:38.220 --> 00:41:42.010
So what's interesting here is
you're seeing here's how hard

00:41:42.010 --> 00:41:45.840
crew felt it was to communicate
with the ground.

00:41:45.840 --> 00:41:48.020
And here's how hard ground felt
it was to communicate

00:41:48.020 --> 00:41:49.200
with the crew.

00:41:49.200 --> 00:41:52.800
So similar, but not identical.

00:41:52.800 --> 00:41:54.970
And again, you can see that
the mitigations are making

00:41:54.970 --> 00:41:56.740
things better.

00:41:56.740 --> 00:42:01.510
So why are the mitigations
making things better?

00:42:01.510 --> 00:42:04.180
We had four classes of
thing that we did.

00:42:04.180 --> 00:42:06.320
We had the procedure display.

00:42:06.320 --> 00:42:08.380
We advance the caution
and warning.

00:42:08.380 --> 00:42:09.590
We had chat.

00:42:09.590 --> 00:42:12.480
And I had forgotten to mention
that the procedure display

00:42:12.480 --> 00:42:15.610
basically is shared between the
vehicle and the ground.

00:42:15.610 --> 00:42:17.190
So anything the crew is
doing, it's basically

00:42:17.190 --> 00:42:18.030
mirrored on the ground.

00:42:18.030 --> 00:42:21.350
So the ground can basically say
oh, that crew person is in

00:42:21.350 --> 00:42:25.950
the middle of that procedure,
or was five minutes ago.

00:42:25.950 --> 00:42:31.100
So show of hands, who thinks
chat made things better?

00:42:31.100 --> 00:42:33.700
Most people think chat
made things better.

00:42:33.700 --> 00:42:36.010
Procedure display and
technology, anybody think that

00:42:36.010 --> 00:42:39.020
make things better?

00:42:39.020 --> 00:42:40.490
Less so than chat.

00:42:40.490 --> 00:42:43.750
Advance caution and warning for
the systems failures, that

00:42:43.750 --> 00:42:45.010
make things better?

00:42:45.010 --> 00:42:46.450
A couple nods.

00:42:46.450 --> 00:42:48.290
How about spying on the crew?

00:42:48.290 --> 00:42:50.180
I know exactly what step of
the procedure you're on.

00:42:50.180 --> 00:42:51.640
Did that make things better?

00:42:51.640 --> 00:42:54.500
Probably, all of them
a little bit.

00:42:54.500 --> 00:42:56.800
Anybody think that made things
harder in any way?

00:43:00.230 --> 00:43:01.000
Maybe.

00:43:01.000 --> 00:43:02.470
A couple of thoughtful
looks, nobody willing

00:43:02.470 --> 00:43:03.780
to raise their hand.

00:43:03.780 --> 00:43:06.110
Aah, raise your hand.

00:43:06.110 --> 00:43:08.710
OK.

00:43:08.710 --> 00:43:12.400
So once again, the comments
are gold.

00:43:12.400 --> 00:43:14.060
So this is great.

00:43:14.060 --> 00:43:16.680
Ground says, WebPD made it
really easy to follow along,

00:43:16.680 --> 00:43:17.720
even with the time delay.

00:43:17.720 --> 00:43:18.975
So I don't even need
to call up.

00:43:18.975 --> 00:43:20.890
I don't need to ask what
procedure step you're on.

00:43:20.890 --> 00:43:23.750
It just tells me what procedure
step you're on.

00:43:23.750 --> 00:43:26.630
So today, you'll even hear
flight controllers calling up

00:43:26.630 --> 00:43:30.260
to the crew, saying what
procedure step are you in?

00:43:30.260 --> 00:43:31.790
How far did you get
on that step?

00:43:31.790 --> 00:43:32.980
Are you done?

00:43:32.980 --> 00:43:33.840
I'm seeing this.

00:43:33.840 --> 00:43:35.320
Where am I?

00:43:35.320 --> 00:43:36.740
No more.

00:43:36.740 --> 00:43:37.640
No more need for that.

00:43:37.640 --> 00:43:39.600
But look at this.

00:43:39.600 --> 00:43:42.110
This one here is very
interesting too.

00:43:42.110 --> 00:43:44.320
Now, flight controllers have
to watch the web procedure

00:43:44.320 --> 00:43:47.190
display and listen
to the audio.

00:43:47.190 --> 00:43:52.520
So they now have more
things to watch.

00:43:52.520 --> 00:43:56.330
So some of what was being made
better is also being made a

00:43:56.330 --> 00:43:57.050
tiny bit worse.

00:43:57.050 --> 00:43:59.320
So that was interesting.

00:43:59.320 --> 00:44:02.082
We didn't quite expect that.

00:44:02.082 --> 00:44:04.460
That was good.

00:44:04.460 --> 00:44:07.360
So the advance caution and
warning, this one is a pretty

00:44:07.360 --> 00:44:11.120
interesting one because several
people said that the

00:44:11.120 --> 00:44:13.160
failures that we had were fairly
straightforward and

00:44:13.160 --> 00:44:15.510
simple, given the simplicity
of the vehicle.

00:44:15.510 --> 00:44:17.950
But in a real vehicle where
you've got two, three, four,

00:44:17.950 --> 00:44:21.280
five failures deep, something
like this could really shine.

00:44:21.280 --> 00:44:24.210
But even here, even in these
simple cases, people said,

00:44:24.210 --> 00:44:25.780
gosh, I knew exactly
what to do.

00:44:25.780 --> 00:44:26.810
I worked these procedures.

00:44:26.810 --> 00:44:27.670
Ground told me what to do.

00:44:27.670 --> 00:44:29.330
But I was done already.

00:44:29.330 --> 00:44:32.020
So this was pretty much a win.

00:44:32.020 --> 00:44:33.270
So that was good.

00:44:37.950 --> 00:44:39.060
All right.

00:44:39.060 --> 00:44:41.740
So last question, which
is good because

00:44:41.740 --> 00:44:42.990
we're almost done.

00:44:45.450 --> 00:44:50.690
So even without something like
chat to basically make it

00:44:50.690 --> 00:44:53.850
possible for people to talk
less, do you think people

00:44:53.850 --> 00:44:58.150
would talk more or less with
increased time delay?

00:44:58.150 --> 00:45:02.240
Anybody think more talking with
increased time delay?

00:45:02.240 --> 00:45:05.060
Less talking with
increased delay?

00:45:05.060 --> 00:45:07.870
Anybody think it's
about the same?

00:45:07.870 --> 00:45:08.940
No idea.

00:45:08.940 --> 00:45:12.220
And then obviously, we would
expect them to talk less.

00:45:12.220 --> 00:45:16.560
But let's see what
the numbers say.

00:45:16.560 --> 00:45:20.660
Well, surprise, surprise, time
delay didn't seem to impact

00:45:20.660 --> 00:45:22.020
how much people talked.

00:45:22.020 --> 00:45:24.400
They talked about the same.

00:45:24.400 --> 00:45:27.170
So that was a surprise.

00:45:27.170 --> 00:45:30.650
So what we're seeing here is
total talk time as measured by

00:45:30.650 --> 00:45:32.755
basically clicking on
and clicking off of

00:45:32.755 --> 00:45:34.670
the voice loop mics.

00:45:34.670 --> 00:45:37.420
So if you count the total number
of seconds, what you're

00:45:37.420 --> 00:45:42.330
seeing is that in both cases,
both for the mitigation case

00:45:42.330 --> 00:45:43.860
and for the baseline,
people were talking

00:45:43.860 --> 00:45:45.670
roughly the same amount.

00:45:45.670 --> 00:45:46.490
So that was interesting.

00:45:46.490 --> 00:45:47.320
Yeah?

00:45:47.320 --> 00:45:48.900
AUDIENCE: About the technology,
when there's no

00:45:48.900 --> 00:45:51.890
delay, do you still have to hold
duplex, hold the duplex

00:45:51.890 --> 00:45:52.740
and talk at the same time?

00:45:52.740 --> 00:45:55.960
Or if there's no delay, do
you still push Talk?

00:45:55.960 --> 00:45:57.180
JEREMY FRANK: There
is full duplex.

00:45:57.180 --> 00:45:59.370
And actually one of the things
that you sometimes find is

00:45:59.370 --> 00:46:01.000
people are stomping
on each other.

00:46:01.000 --> 00:46:02.670
So I'm trying to talk.

00:46:02.670 --> 00:46:04.420
But I've mistimed when
your voice is coming.

00:46:04.420 --> 00:46:06.470
So I'm basically stepping
on you.

00:46:06.470 --> 00:46:09.010
And that was something that some
other people are taking

00:46:09.010 --> 00:46:13.130
our data and analyzing, trying
to understand how did that

00:46:13.130 --> 00:46:15.300
sort of come into play.

00:46:15.300 --> 00:46:18.460
But yeah, so you could have--

00:46:18.460 --> 00:46:19.360
I don't know exactly.

00:46:19.360 --> 00:46:21.200
I don't remember how many
channels we had.

00:46:21.200 --> 00:46:24.720
And our Kennedy Space Center
participants actually managed

00:46:24.720 --> 00:46:25.680
all the coms for us.

00:46:25.680 --> 00:46:27.400
And I'm not sure exactly
how they did it.

00:46:27.400 --> 00:46:28.440
Yeah?

00:46:28.440 --> 00:46:33.430
AUDIENCE: It seems to me that
voice is just completely wrong

00:46:33.430 --> 00:46:40.860
for this type of-- when delay
than a few seconds, it's just

00:46:40.860 --> 00:46:43.134
not reasonable to--

00:46:43.134 --> 00:46:46.122
I mean voice is great when it's
instantaneous or almost

00:46:46.122 --> 00:46:48.612
instantaneous because then you
can have a conversation.

00:46:48.612 --> 00:46:51.154
But when can't have a
conservation, what you said,

00:46:51.154 --> 00:46:53.539
chat is basically email.

00:46:53.539 --> 00:46:56.430
Or back in the old days,
you sent a letter.

00:46:56.430 --> 00:47:00.910
Never started talking and then
have someone relay your voice

00:47:00.910 --> 00:47:05.150
in the same thing.

00:47:05.150 --> 00:47:06.760
JEREMY FRANK: That's a
really good point.

00:47:06.760 --> 00:47:09.790
Except that a huge amount of
information is conveyed in

00:47:09.790 --> 00:47:13.310
voice, even if it's delayed,
and so voice

00:47:13.310 --> 00:47:15.260
timbre, choice of wording.

00:47:15.260 --> 00:47:17.540
And one of the things that other
people are doing, which

00:47:17.540 --> 00:47:20.330
I'll get to in a little bit,
well, voice, email, sure.

00:47:20.330 --> 00:47:21.240
You could do that.

00:47:21.240 --> 00:47:25.390
But other things that people
started to ask was what was

00:47:25.390 --> 00:47:27.380
chat used for as opposed
to voice?

00:47:27.380 --> 00:47:29.030
When people had freedom
of choice, what did

00:47:29.030 --> 00:47:30.090
they choose to do?

00:47:30.090 --> 00:47:32.530
And it turned out that chat
was pretty good for

00:47:32.530 --> 00:47:34.280
quantitative data
like numbers.

00:47:34.280 --> 00:47:35.890
Voice was good for
non-numbers.

00:47:35.890 --> 00:47:38.880
So there are other kinds of
interesting modality questions

00:47:38.880 --> 00:47:42.517
that I think don't totally
preclude using voice.

00:47:42.517 --> 00:47:45.802
AUDIENCE: But I mean if you
managed voice like email in

00:47:45.802 --> 00:47:47.650
the sense that its
all recorded.

00:47:47.650 --> 00:47:48.850
You can always go back.

00:47:48.850 --> 00:47:50.120
You can always relisten.

00:47:50.120 --> 00:47:56.160
And then basically when the
length of is by an order of

00:47:56.160 --> 00:48:00.200
magnitude or even sorter than
the delay, it makes sense to

00:48:00.200 --> 00:48:03.100
construct a message
and send it.

00:48:03.100 --> 00:48:05.550
I mean you can optimize and
start to sending the message

00:48:05.550 --> 00:48:06.730
before its finished.

00:48:06.730 --> 00:48:10.100
But on management, you don't
start playing the message

00:48:10.100 --> 00:48:11.800
until you're ready
to listen to it.

00:48:11.800 --> 00:48:12.660
JEREMY FRANK: That's true too.

00:48:12.660 --> 00:48:16.040
But as you'll see from some of
the chat context question and

00:48:16.040 --> 00:48:18.510
answers, why do people like
chat, there's some other

00:48:18.510 --> 00:48:20.810
advantages that we're not quite
there on for voice.

00:48:20.810 --> 00:48:22.070
But you're absolutely right.

00:48:22.070 --> 00:48:24.010
But this is all about how do
you think differently about

00:48:24.010 --> 00:48:25.775
what people do and
how they do it.

00:48:25.775 --> 00:48:26.200
Yeah?

00:48:26.200 --> 00:48:26.950
AUDIENCE: This might
be your next slide.

00:48:26.950 --> 00:48:30.874
I mean did you learn anything
from this set of exercises

00:48:30.874 --> 00:48:32.435
that you immediately
wanted to put into

00:48:32.435 --> 00:48:34.230
practice with the ISS?

00:48:34.230 --> 00:48:35.530
JEREMY FRANK: There were a
number of things that people

00:48:35.530 --> 00:48:37.110
wanted to at least
consider trying.

00:48:37.110 --> 00:48:39.380
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE] it
seems like a huge win.

00:48:39.380 --> 00:48:39.834
JEREMY FRANK: Absolutely.

00:48:39.834 --> 00:48:42.110
AUDIENCE: --lowered orbit.

00:48:42.110 --> 00:48:42.940
JEREMY FRANK: So chat's
one of them.

00:48:42.940 --> 00:48:44.620
Chat had been something
people wanted to do

00:48:44.620 --> 00:48:46.020
for a little while.

00:48:46.020 --> 00:48:48.170
The sharing of data with the
WebPD is another one that

00:48:48.170 --> 00:48:50.370
people were very excited
about using.

00:48:50.370 --> 00:48:53.510
There are some barriers to
putting things on ISS that

00:48:53.510 --> 00:48:54.760
make it harder.

00:48:57.810 --> 00:49:01.320
So this result that we found
here where basically the time

00:49:01.320 --> 00:49:02.890
delay didn't influence
how much talking,

00:49:02.890 --> 00:49:03.910
that was a real surprise.

00:49:03.910 --> 00:49:05.450
Because we all sort of expected

00:49:05.450 --> 00:49:06.470
that it would be different.

00:49:06.470 --> 00:49:11.110
But what is very striking and
quite obvious, in mitigation,

00:49:11.110 --> 00:49:15.380
people talked something
like 20% to 33% less.

00:49:15.380 --> 00:49:19.320
Or to put it more accurately,
80% of the time that people

00:49:19.320 --> 00:49:22.180
spend talking, they
spent a lot less.

00:49:22.180 --> 00:49:23.750
So the question is why?

00:49:23.750 --> 00:49:26.460
Was it all chat or was there
something else going on?

00:49:26.460 --> 00:49:29.400
And so we did a-- whoops.

00:49:29.400 --> 00:49:32.010
We did a badly constructed
slide, which I failed to QA

00:49:32.010 --> 00:49:32.970
before the talk.

00:49:32.970 --> 00:49:33.480
Oh, well.

00:49:33.480 --> 00:49:35.690
So had something else
had to go wrong.

00:49:35.690 --> 00:49:38.460
So what we can do is
we could take a

00:49:38.460 --> 00:49:40.080
look at the chat messages.

00:49:40.080 --> 00:49:43.490
We could pretend, unlike me,
that a chat message would have

00:49:43.490 --> 00:49:45.640
been spoken by either a crew
person or a member of the

00:49:45.640 --> 00:49:48.380
flight control team at roughly
two words per second.

00:49:48.380 --> 00:49:51.080
And then we can say, if you add
that to the time people

00:49:51.080 --> 00:49:53.470
actually spent talking,
what do you get?

00:49:53.470 --> 00:49:55.780
And what you see is that you
still get reductions in the

00:49:55.780 --> 00:49:58.290
amount of time between baseline
and communication.

00:49:58.290 --> 00:50:01.130
So something else in that set
of tools, which we could not

00:50:01.130 --> 00:50:04.230
pinpoint, is also contributing
to a reduction in how much

00:50:04.230 --> 00:50:05.740
time people are talking.

00:50:05.740 --> 00:50:06.800
Some of it's chat.

00:50:06.800 --> 00:50:07.850
Some of it's something else.

00:50:07.850 --> 00:50:10.195
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE] procedure
display [INAUDIBLE]?

00:50:10.195 --> 00:50:11.133
JEREMY FRANK: Probably.

00:50:11.133 --> 00:50:11.602
Yeah?

00:50:11.602 --> 00:50:12.540
AUDIENCE: I had a question.

00:50:12.540 --> 00:50:17.020
I didn't quite understand the
complaint that a procedure

00:50:17.020 --> 00:50:19.840
display increased monitoring
[INAUDIBLE]?

00:50:19.840 --> 00:50:21.835
It was a few slides back.

00:50:21.835 --> 00:50:25.715
Because I would expect that if
they have a display they'd

00:50:25.715 --> 00:50:27.978
have to answer it some other
way, whether keeping in their

00:50:27.978 --> 00:50:31.050
head or writing it down on a
piece of paper, what step the

00:50:31.050 --> 00:50:33.490
remote astronaut was on.

00:50:33.490 --> 00:50:36.510
JEREMY FRANK: So this I think
gets down into the intricacies

00:50:36.510 --> 00:50:39.370
of when the crew needs to tell
someone, I'm in the middle of

00:50:39.370 --> 00:50:42.340
this procedure, I'm on this step
and I have an issue, how

00:50:42.340 --> 00:50:43.590
is that done?

00:50:43.590 --> 00:50:46.880
Or if the ground wants to know
where someone is and they

00:50:46.880 --> 00:50:49.280
can't otherwise find out, what
other displays are they

00:50:49.280 --> 00:50:49.790
looking at?

00:50:49.790 --> 00:50:52.410
And we didn't have the analysis
and we didn't have

00:50:52.410 --> 00:50:54.170
quite the amount of information
to get down to

00:50:54.170 --> 00:50:55.626
that level of detail.

00:50:55.626 --> 00:51:01.150
AUDIENCE: It seems to me then
if some of the time is spent

00:51:01.150 --> 00:51:02.715
checking, asking the astronaut
what step are you on?

00:51:02.715 --> 00:51:03.491
Oh, I'm on this step.

00:51:03.491 --> 00:51:04.700
Can you repeat?

00:51:04.700 --> 00:51:08.670
And if you had a procedural
display, then wouldn't some of

00:51:08.670 --> 00:51:12.010
that talk be eliminated by
just referring to the

00:51:12.010 --> 00:51:12.625
procedural display.

00:51:12.625 --> 00:51:14.510
And it might explain
some of the--

00:51:14.510 --> 00:51:16.590
JEREMY FRANK: Absolutely.

00:51:16.590 --> 00:51:19.780
But the fact that it's a
nuanced story is the

00:51:19.780 --> 00:51:20.510
interesting thing.

00:51:20.510 --> 00:51:21.760
It wasn't a knock it
out of the park.

00:51:21.760 --> 00:51:23.020
There were no issues
with this.

00:51:23.020 --> 00:51:24.500
It was all very natural.

00:51:24.500 --> 00:51:26.530
Flight controllers were saying,
I've got a piece of

00:51:26.530 --> 00:51:28.340
information I didn't
have before.

00:51:28.340 --> 00:51:31.360
I felt like I was doing things
that were contributing to my

00:51:31.360 --> 00:51:33.150
workload that I didn't do.

00:51:33.150 --> 00:51:39.100
So when we talked to them more
about this, it was less a

00:51:39.100 --> 00:51:41.640
matter of this is a problem
with the technology.

00:51:41.640 --> 00:51:43.500
It's an awareness of something
we would need to

00:51:43.500 --> 00:51:44.700
train people to do.

00:51:44.700 --> 00:51:48.020
How is it that you shift your
attention focus from your

00:51:48.020 --> 00:51:50.690
monitor displays to your
procedure display, if you had

00:51:50.690 --> 00:51:53.650
such a thing?

00:51:53.650 --> 00:51:55.120
Yeah?

00:51:55.120 --> 00:51:56.370
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

00:51:58.700 --> 00:52:01.610
But I assume you also have to
think of the content of the

00:52:01.610 --> 00:52:02.095
discussion.

00:52:02.095 --> 00:52:05.010
I think this is something
[INAUDIBLE].

00:52:05.010 --> 00:52:06.620
JEREMY FRANK: So some other
people are analyzing the

00:52:06.620 --> 00:52:09.290
content a little more to try
and understand and sort of

00:52:09.290 --> 00:52:11.540
come up with, if you like, sort
of a formal model of what

00:52:11.540 --> 00:52:14.836
people were and weren't
saying.

00:52:14.836 --> 00:52:18.541
AUDIENCE: I mean obviously
mission control could be more

00:52:18.541 --> 00:52:21.258
easily manned by adding more
mission controllers.

00:52:21.258 --> 00:52:22.730
They're significantly
cheaper than the

00:52:22.730 --> 00:52:26.640
technical crew on the shift.

00:52:26.640 --> 00:52:28.310
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

00:52:28.310 --> 00:52:29.032
JEREMY FRANK: Pardon.

00:52:29.032 --> 00:52:30.180
AUDIENCE: We hope you get
paid better [INAUDIBLE].

00:52:30.180 --> 00:52:33.030
JEREMY FRANK: Well, so full
disclosure, I'm not a control

00:52:33.030 --> 00:52:33.770
center person.

00:52:33.770 --> 00:52:35.880
I just try and give them stuff
that they can use.

00:52:35.880 --> 00:52:38.260
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

00:52:38.260 --> 00:52:39.520
JEREMY FRANK: And
it's very true.

00:52:39.520 --> 00:52:42.810
But the pressure has been to
try and understand what you

00:52:42.810 --> 00:52:45.040
must do in order to control.

00:52:45.040 --> 00:52:46.980
Can you do it with
fewer people?

00:52:46.980 --> 00:52:49.550
Do you really need people
there 24 by 7?

00:52:49.550 --> 00:52:55.116
And the answer is it's not
entirely clear if we can.

00:52:55.116 --> 00:52:59.990
But the costs of a control
center are very high, data,

00:52:59.990 --> 00:53:03.320
voice, the building,
all the com.

00:53:03.320 --> 00:53:05.575
Communication itself
is very expensive.

00:53:05.575 --> 00:53:08.100
If you look at how much it costs
to maintain deep space

00:53:08.100 --> 00:53:10.550
network communications to all of
this remote places, it's a

00:53:10.550 --> 00:53:11.590
lot of money.

00:53:11.590 --> 00:53:14.640
So controlling the cost of the
control center is still an

00:53:14.640 --> 00:53:16.020
important thing to consider
how to do.

00:53:18.790 --> 00:53:19.500
All right.

00:53:19.500 --> 00:53:24.270
So let's see.

00:53:24.270 --> 00:53:27.610
So once again, we got this
sort of nuanced story.

00:53:27.610 --> 00:53:29.750
So chat removed the need
to do a lot of things.

00:53:29.750 --> 00:53:31.650
You could roll back
and read the chat.

00:53:31.650 --> 00:53:34.660
So if you had good voice to
text, well that would be a

00:53:34.660 --> 00:53:36.840
good justification for saying,
well, you just speak into the

00:53:36.840 --> 00:53:37.820
mic and send an email.

00:53:37.820 --> 00:53:40.080
But we don't have good
voice to text yet.

00:53:40.080 --> 00:53:43.470
But again, there's now this
other piece of information.

00:53:43.470 --> 00:53:45.670
Some of this is just they're not
accustomed to monitoring

00:53:45.670 --> 00:53:47.790
these pieces of information,
which I think is to

00:53:47.790 --> 00:53:50.800
overcomeable compared to the
obvious benefits of it.

00:53:50.800 --> 00:53:52.590
But it's all little
new for them.

00:53:52.590 --> 00:53:53.970
So they're still coming
to terms with it.

00:53:57.890 --> 00:53:59.670
OK.

00:53:59.670 --> 00:54:01.870
I'm almost done.

00:54:01.870 --> 00:54:10.110
So I didn't fully understand at
the time that we did this,

00:54:10.110 --> 00:54:15.290
about a year ago, a year and a
half ago, that if you look at

00:54:15.290 --> 00:54:18.040
some of these things that we're
employing in order to

00:54:18.040 --> 00:54:20.820
mitigate a time delay, it's
this mix of old and new or

00:54:20.820 --> 00:54:23.970
it's this mix of sort of high
end NASA stuff plus things

00:54:23.970 --> 00:54:26.780
that really we're using all the
time and every day now.

00:54:26.780 --> 00:54:29.630
And there are other people who
are much more sophisticated

00:54:29.630 --> 00:54:32.110
about how communication
takes place.

00:54:32.110 --> 00:54:36.560
But deep space missions are
going to be managed in an era

00:54:36.560 --> 00:54:39.470
of asynchronous communication in
a way that today's missions

00:54:39.470 --> 00:54:40.570
really are not.

00:54:40.570 --> 00:54:43.330
And thinking about that and
coming to terms with it, it's

00:54:43.330 --> 00:54:44.210
not a big surprise.

00:54:44.210 --> 00:54:46.700
Mars missions are managed
like this all the time.

00:54:46.700 --> 00:54:48.390
Every single Mars mission
that we conduct is

00:54:48.390 --> 00:54:50.080
managed this way.

00:54:50.080 --> 00:54:52.560
Missions to places like Mercury,
Mercury Messenger

00:54:52.560 --> 00:54:53.620
being the prime example,
they're

00:54:53.620 --> 00:54:55.120
managed this way today.

00:54:55.120 --> 00:54:57.930
So the human space flight world
is going to ultimately

00:54:57.930 --> 00:54:59.270
learn how to make use
of these things.

00:54:59.270 --> 00:55:01.120
It's just a matter of time.

00:55:01.120 --> 00:55:03.690
And if that's the place where
we're going to send people,

00:55:03.690 --> 00:55:05.670
then I think we have a pretty
good idea of how to at least

00:55:05.670 --> 00:55:07.670
get started.

00:55:07.670 --> 00:55:14.420
So I want to linger on this
slide filled with names

00:55:14.420 --> 00:55:18.410
because this was a giant,
cross-NASA achievement that we

00:55:18.410 --> 00:55:22.520
actually managed to pull off,
ridiculously in about a year.

00:55:22.520 --> 00:55:24.290
I still don't quite know
how we did it.

00:55:24.290 --> 00:55:27.890
But props to every single
person on this list.

00:55:27.890 --> 00:55:29.090
Everybody worked really,
really hard

00:55:29.090 --> 00:55:29.780
to accomplish this.

00:55:29.780 --> 00:55:33.050
It was absolutely fantastic, a
wonderful group of people.

00:55:33.050 --> 00:55:34.850
I was very privileged
to work with them.

00:55:34.850 --> 00:55:36.740
And it was great and I'm done.

00:55:36.740 --> 00:55:37.990
So thank you very much.
