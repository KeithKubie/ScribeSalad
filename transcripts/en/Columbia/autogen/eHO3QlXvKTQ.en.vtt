very interesting policy decisions the

01:12:07.110 --> 01:12:07.120
very interesting policy decisions the
 

01:12:07.120 --> 01:12:08.790
very interesting policy decisions the

were done with nuclear power and if you

01:12:13.470 --> 01:12:13.480
were done with nuclear power and if you

follow the internal discussion on us
 

01:12:15.040 --> 01:12:16.320
follow the internal discussion on us
although wasn't that much of it the

01:12:16.320 --> 01:12:16.330
although wasn't that much of it the
 

01:12:16.330 --> 01:12:18.030
although wasn't that much of it the

argue number but what was filtering

01:12:21.870 --> 01:12:21.880
argue number but what was filtering
 

01:12:21.880 --> 01:12:23.700
argue number but what was filtering
through was a kind of a one-way bet on

01:12:23.700 --> 01:12:23.710
through was a kind of a one-way bet on
 

01:12:23.710 --> 01:12:26.010
through was a kind of a one-way bet on
the future which was we are actually not

01:12:26.010 --> 01:12:26.020
the future which was we are actually not
 

01:12:26.020 --> 01:12:27.479
the future which was we are actually not
crazy people we believe in global

01:12:27.479 --> 01:12:27.489
crazy people we believe in global
 

01:12:27.489 --> 01:12:29.880
crazy people we believe in global
warming and we know that we have the

01:12:29.880 --> 01:12:29.890
warming and we know that we have the
 

01:12:29.890 --> 01:12:32.250
warming and we know that we have the
smartest engineers on the planet so if

01:12:32.250 --> 01:12:32.260
smartest engineers on the planet so if
 

01:12:32.260 --> 01:12:34.260
smartest engineers on the planet so if
we basically get our minds together and

01:12:34.260 --> 01:12:34.270
we basically get our minds together and
 

01:12:34.270 --> 01:12:36.300
we basically get our minds together and
do this we can figure out Green Tech

01:12:36.300 --> 01:12:36.310
do this we can figure out Green Tech
 

01:12:36.310 --> 01:12:37.560
do this we can figure out Green Tech
because if anybody's going to do it's

01:12:37.560 --> 01:12:37.570
because if anybody's going to do it's
 

01:12:37.570 --> 01:12:39.540
because if anybody's going to do it's
going to be us and if we do it we can

01:12:39.540 --> 01:12:39.550
going to be us and if we do it we can
 

01:12:39.550 --> 01:12:41.700
going to be us and if we do it we can
print money for the next 150 years we

01:12:41.700 --> 01:12:41.710
print money for the next 150 years we
 

01:12:41.710 --> 01:12:43.680
print money for the next 150 years we
can sell it to China evidence because

01:12:43.680 --> 01:12:43.690
can sell it to China evidence because
 

01:12:43.690 --> 01:12:44.760
can sell it to China evidence because
the Americans aren't going to do it they

01:12:44.760 --> 01:12:44.770
the Americans aren't going to do it they
 

01:12:44.770 --> 01:12:46.470
the Americans aren't going to do it they
don't believe in the dumb thing so this

01:12:46.470 --> 01:12:46.480
don't believe in the dumb thing so this
 

01:12:46.480 --> 01:12:47.910
don't believe in the dumb thing so this
is sort of the discourse in the engineer

01:12:47.910 --> 01:12:47.920
is sort of the discourse in the engineer
 

01:12:47.920 --> 01:12:49.470
is sort of the discourse in the engineer
so they're going to do this thing now

01:12:49.470 --> 01:12:49.480
so they're going to do this thing now
 

01:12:49.480 --> 01:12:51.209
so they're going to do this thing now
here's the problem you then but have

01:12:51.209 --> 01:12:51.219
here's the problem you then but have
 

01:12:51.219 --> 01:12:54.060
here's the problem you then but have
this crazy idea of a debt break which

01:12:54.060 --> 01:12:54.070
this crazy idea of a debt break which
 

01:12:54.070 --> 01:12:55.950
this crazy idea of a debt break which
means that you can't do the loss leading

01:12:55.950 --> 01:12:55.960
means that you can't do the loss leading
 

01:12:55.960 --> 01:12:58.020
means that you can't do the loss leading
investments that you would need because

01:12:58.020 --> 01:12:58.030
investments that you would need because
 

01:12:58.030 --> 01:13:01.470
investments that you would need because
debt is an investment in the future to

01:13:01.470 --> 01:13:01.480
debt is an investment in the future to
 

01:13:01.480 --> 01:13:03.090
debt is an investment in the future to
actually make those types of

01:13:03.090 --> 01:13:03.100
actually make those types of
 

01:13:03.100 --> 01:13:05.399
actually make those types of
technologies even remotely possible so

01:13:05.399 --> 01:13:05.409
technologies even remotely possible so
 

01:13:05.409 --> 01:13:06.840
technologies even remotely possible so
they've decided they're going to cancel

01:13:06.840 --> 01:13:06.850
they've decided they're going to cancel
 

01:13:06.850 --> 01:13:09.270
they've decided they're going to cancel
nuclear power sign up to 30 years of

extra dependence on the Russians and
 

01:13:11.050 --> 01:13:13.350
extra dependence on the Russians and
then they go to somehow innovate with

01:13:13.350 --> 01:13:13.360
then they go to somehow innovate with
 

01:13:13.360 --> 01:13:15.930
then they go to somehow innovate with
absolutely no loss leading capital

01:13:15.930 --> 01:13:15.940
absolutely no loss leading capital
 

01:13:15.940 --> 01:13:17.700
absolutely no loss leading capital
budget to do so because the government

01:13:17.700 --> 01:13:17.710
budget to do so because the government
 

01:13:17.710 --> 01:13:19.950
budget to do so because the government
can't run any debts of deficits that's

01:13:19.950 --> 01:13:19.960
can't run any debts of deficits that's
 

01:13:19.960 --> 01:13:21.390
can't run any debts of deficits that's
why their ideas behind their

01:13:21.390 --> 01:13:21.400
why their ideas behind their
 

01:13:21.400 --> 01:13:24.899
why their ideas behind their
institutions are stupid so that's how I

01:13:24.899 --> 01:13:24.909
institutions are stupid so that's how I
 

01:13:24.909 --> 01:13:26.430
institutions are stupid so that's how I
think about the problem they're caught

01:13:26.430 --> 01:13:26.440
think about the problem they're caught
 

01:13:26.440 --> 01:13:27.899

get out of it actually just at this

you sort necessarily had to be very fast
in your presentation if recovering two

the impression at least

01:13:54.590 --> 01:13:54.600
the impression at least
 

01:13:54.600 --> 01:13:57.020
the impression at least
in the audience of economists sort of

01:13:57.020 --> 01:13:57.030
in the audience of economists sort of
 

01:13:57.030 --> 01:13:59.360
in the audience of economists sort of
just as these mouthpieces for this

stupidest and I was wondering if you

stupidest and I was wondering if you
could reflect more on the specific

could reflect more on the specific
 

01:14:05.130 --> 01:14:07.310
could reflect more on the specific
causal mechanism that you see here like

01:14:07.310 --> 01:14:07.320
causal mechanism that you see here like
 

01:14:07.320 --> 01:14:09.230
causal mechanism that you see here like
connecting ideas and institutions and

at least again I kind of got the sense

01:14:18.590 --> 01:14:18.600
at least again I kind of got the sense
 

01:14:18.600 --> 01:14:20.480
at least again I kind of got the sense
of your presentation sort of like a

01:14:20.480 --> 01:14:20.490
of your presentation sort of like a
 

01:14:20.490 --> 01:14:23.420

steady and very significant influence of
 

01:14:23.430 --> 01:14:26.570
steady and very significant influence of
economists over policy from say like

01:14:26.570 --> 01:14:26.580
economists over policy from say like
 

01:14:26.580 --> 01:14:28.850
economists over policy from say like
Hume onward and I was wondering if you

Hume onward and I was wondering if you
 

01:14:28.860 --> 01:14:31.520
Hume onward and I was wondering if you
could reflect more on the specific role

01:14:31.520 --> 01:14:31.530
could reflect more on the specific role
 

01:14:31.530 --> 01:14:33.530
could reflect more on the specific role
of economist and their influence over

of economist and their influence over
 

01:14:33.540 --> 01:14:35.540
of economist and their influence over
policy like especially arguably right

that out a little bit we had something
 

01:14:41.100 --> 01:14:43.580
that out a little bit we had something
because we have actually very little

because we have actually very little
 

01:14:43.590 --> 01:14:45.020
because we have actually very little
time and it's not exactly the same thing

01:14:45.020 --> 01:14:45.030
time and it's not exactly the same thing
 

01:14:45.030 --> 01:14:48.620
time and it's not exactly the same thing
but it's about the the the the

but it's about the the the the
 

01:14:48.630 --> 01:14:51.770
but it's about the the the the
