00:00:00.106 --> 00:00:01.706
&gt;&gt;It's really cool school.

00:00:01.706 --> 00:00:03.906
I've never gone to a
school quite like it.

00:00:04.216 --> 00:00:06.696
&gt;&gt;Well, we get to design games
and play each other's games,

00:00:07.146 --> 00:00:09.966
so instead of just doing
work, work, work all day.

00:00:10.346 --> 00:00:13.096
&gt;&gt;Well, we have the basic
classes of a school,

00:00:13.096 --> 00:00:16.146
but we gave them different names,
like math is called Code World.

00:00:16.816 --> 00:00:18.866
Science is the Way Things Work.

00:00:18.866 --> 00:00:21.106
&gt;&gt;We learn everything that
all the other schools learn.

00:00:21.106 --> 00:00:24.236
We just learn it differently.

00:00:29.076 --> 00:00:31.236
&gt;&gt;My name's Katie Salen and I
wear a couple of different hats.

00:00:31.416 --> 00:00:34.536
One, I'm a professor at Parsons,
the New School of Design and I teach

00:00:34.536 --> 00:00:36.336
in a program there called
Designing Technology.

00:00:36.896 --> 00:00:40.556
I also run a nonprofit called the
Institute of Play, which is a games

00:00:40.556 --> 00:00:43.926
and learning space where we
develop all kinds of stuff

00:00:43.976 --> 00:00:44.626
around games and learning.

00:00:44.626 --> 00:00:47.616
And then my last hat is, I'm
an executive director of design

00:00:47.616 --> 00:00:50.366
at this new middle school called
Quest to Learn in New York City.

00:00:54.086 --> 00:00:57.586
&gt;&gt;Quest to Learn is a new sixth grade
through twelfth grade public school

00:00:57.586 --> 00:01:00.656
that opened in New York City
in Fall 2009, and it's a school

00:01:00.656 --> 00:01:03.086
that has the tagline,
school for digital kids.

00:01:03.676 --> 00:01:06.906
And all that means is that we
believe that kids can and do learn

00:01:06.906 --> 00:01:11.306
in different ways outside of school,
often via access to digital media

00:01:11.306 --> 00:01:13.786
and access to kind of
online community support.

00:01:13.946 --> 00:01:16.386
And that if we know
that learning outside

00:01:16.386 --> 00:01:19.616
of school matters a great deal
to kids' ability to learn well

00:01:19.616 --> 00:01:21.976
in school, we have to
pay attention to that.

00:01:24.316 --> 00:01:27.066
&gt;&gt;So it's a school that from
the ground up has been designed

00:01:27.406 --> 00:01:30.986
to leverage the kind of digital
lives of kids, and it also looks

00:01:30.986 --> 00:01:33.336
at the notion of how games
work as learning systems,

00:01:33.396 --> 00:01:35.646
and it's developed a
pedagogical approach

00:01:36.046 --> 00:01:38.236
that delivers what we
call game-like learning.

00:01:38.696 --> 00:01:40.366
And all that means is
that kids are dropped

00:01:40.366 --> 00:01:44.196
into complex challenge based context,
that they have no ability to solve

00:01:44.326 --> 00:01:45.746
at the beginning of ten weeks.

00:01:46.456 --> 00:01:49.156
And then that ten week
structure, what we call a mission,

00:01:49.156 --> 00:01:52.696
is broken down into a series of
smaller challenges, that scaffold

00:01:52.696 --> 00:01:55.846
and really engage that kid in
learning how to do something

00:01:55.846 --> 00:01:57.766
that will allow them to
solve that complex problem.

00:01:58.276 --> 00:01:59.786
&gt;&gt;In watching these games,

00:01:59.786 --> 00:02:03.406
you realize the reason why
these games are so popular,

00:02:03.546 --> 00:02:07.196
is they're so carefully balanced
between offense and defense.

00:02:07.936 --> 00:02:12.266
There's so many choices,
there's so many challenges.

00:02:12.446 --> 00:02:18.066
&gt;&gt;We're trying to prove that game
design can help kids think deeper

00:02:18.606 --> 00:02:22.356
and more abstractly
about everything else.

00:02:22.536 --> 00:02:25.986
And that we feel that the
thing about game design is

00:02:26.256 --> 00:02:29.486
that that's this generation's
mode of discourse.

00:02:29.486 --> 00:02:34.246
It's a fully mainstreamed art
form, just like cinema is,

00:02:34.316 --> 00:02:37.476
but a hundred years ago, you
couldn't study cinema in a school.

00:02:37.846 --> 00:02:40.146
Now every school has a
cinematography class,

00:02:40.146 --> 00:02:44.046
and game design has now reached
a sort of mainstream acceptance.

00:02:44.226 --> 00:02:47.826
It's how kids socialize,
by playing games.

00:02:49.886 --> 00:02:52.516
&gt;&gt;A lot of concerns that parents
have when we start talking

00:02:52.516 --> 00:02:56.586
about games is a concern
around competition,

00:02:57.226 --> 00:03:00.876
and a concern around notions of
kind of incentives and rewards.

00:03:01.016 --> 00:03:03.666
And what they get worried about
is, "Oh, there's this game stuff

00:03:03.666 --> 00:03:05.896
where kids get addicted and all
they wanna do is get better,

00:03:05.896 --> 00:03:06.706
better, better."

00:03:07.316 --> 00:03:11.056
And so we've tried to strike a
balance with that to say that, "Well,

00:03:11.056 --> 00:03:14.376
what's really awesome about that is
that kids are driven to get better."

00:03:14.506 --> 00:03:17.876
And one thing games do do very,
very well, is they understand how

00:03:18.086 --> 00:03:20.786
to incentivize players
to want to get better.

00:03:21.046 --> 00:03:25.646
&gt;&gt;And then you have two goals, but
one of them is impossible to get to.

00:03:25.646 --> 00:03:25.826
&gt;&gt;Teacher: Okay.

00:03:25.826 --> 00:03:28.886
&gt;&gt;My game has two goals that
are both possible to get to.

00:03:29.156 --> 00:03:31.956
&gt;&gt;So the way that our curriculum
is structured in mission

00:03:31.956 --> 00:03:33.686
and quest based, so
it actually builds

00:03:33.686 --> 00:03:35.656
on that trope from online gaming.

00:03:36.086 --> 00:03:40.446
And the idea is that quests actually
get harder as you move through them,

00:03:40.446 --> 00:03:42.886
because you're actually developing
tools and developing knowledge

00:03:42.886 --> 00:03:44.186
and developing experiences.

00:03:44.186 --> 00:03:46.416
And the goal is that you
actually can't move to a quest

00:03:46.576 --> 00:03:48.056
until you've completed one prior.

00:03:48.336 --> 00:03:51.656
They're proceeding through
some kind of challenge

00:03:51.656 --> 00:03:54.546
and they're getting closer to some
kind of end goal, and we have found

00:03:54.546 --> 00:03:57.186
that that's very motivating for kids,
that they know where they're at,

00:03:57.916 --> 00:04:00.216
they know how far they've come and
they know what they need to work on.

00:04:02.656 --> 00:04:05.696
&gt;&gt;Game design is not just
sitting in front of a computer

00:04:05.696 --> 00:04:07.286
and creating a game
where somebody runs

00:04:07.286 --> 00:04:08.966
around collecting coins or something.

00:04:09.426 --> 00:04:13.916
Game design is all about
trial and error and figuring

00:04:13.916 --> 00:04:15.796
out all these things that
would make a good game.

00:04:15.876 --> 00:04:19.646
&gt;&gt;Two of the big ideas that kids
have been working on all year,

00:04:19.646 --> 00:04:21.756
one is ideas of teamwork
and collaboration,

00:04:21.756 --> 00:04:24.436
which we think is a central skill
in the twenty-first century.

00:04:24.836 --> 00:04:27.816
Being able to not only work
together with somebody,

00:04:27.816 --> 00:04:31.316
but to have a specific expertise
and being able to talk with someone

00:04:31.316 --> 00:04:33.326
about that, share with
someone about that,

00:04:33.326 --> 00:04:35.366
and kind of co-build
something together.

00:04:35.646 --> 00:04:40.026
The second idea is around this idea
of multi-modality, of kids being able

00:04:40.026 --> 00:04:43.676
to read and encounter text and
stories and image making in a lot

00:04:43.676 --> 00:04:45.076
of different kinds of mediums.

00:04:46.906 --> 00:04:49.026
&gt;&gt;This trimester in the
Sports for the Mind class,

00:04:49.156 --> 00:04:51.556
which is one of the central
systems thinking classes,

00:04:51.556 --> 00:04:55.226
where kids are making games as
a way to learn about systems,

00:04:55.336 --> 00:04:57.846
we decided to work on a
kind of translation project.

00:04:58.216 --> 00:05:01.426
So they're studying a story,
studying Aesop's fables,

00:05:01.936 --> 00:05:04.836
and they're looking at, what does
it take the translate the components

00:05:04.836 --> 00:05:08.496
of a story into a live,
three D game environment?

00:05:08.706 --> 00:05:12.726
And so we're moving from things like
a static page, into an environment

00:05:12.896 --> 00:05:14.516
where the kids have created

00:05:14.916 --> 00:05:17.606
and costumed characters,
they've built sets.

00:05:17.966 --> 00:05:20.606
And then the final
exhibition is, the kids will,

00:05:20.606 --> 00:05:23.226
in this three D game,
perform this story live.

00:05:23.746 --> 00:05:27.756
So it's a little bit like a virtual
theater performance of a story

00:05:27.756 --> 00:05:31.016
that has come from a kind of
oral tradition of storytelling,

00:05:31.016 --> 00:05:33.676
moved to a printed page, moved to
a kind of graphic novel format,

00:05:33.676 --> 00:05:35.116
now into a three D game environment.

00:05:35.836 --> 00:05:40.636
&gt;&gt;We think that design
thinking is actually a way

00:05:40.636 --> 00:05:41.556
of looking at the world.

00:05:41.896 --> 00:05:45.186
It's a way of looking at the world
as someone who is active in thinking

00:05:45.186 --> 00:05:48.886
about how to solve problems,
is active in kind of analyzing

00:05:48.886 --> 00:05:51.096
and understand how things work,
and we think that's a great stance

00:05:51.356 --> 00:05:52.886
to have, to look at
the world generally.

00:05:53.356 --> 00:05:56.436
So we believe these kids are
gonna grow up through work

00:05:56.436 --> 00:05:58.086
in our school as design thinkers.

00:05:58.356 --> 00:05:59.516
That doesn't mean that
they're all gonna go

00:05:59.516 --> 00:06:01.576
on to be designers in
professional lives.

00:06:02.066 --> 00:06:05.846
We would imagine and love that some
of those kids will step into roles

00:06:05.846 --> 00:06:08.306
as wanting to be scientists,
wanting to be writers,

00:06:08.786 --> 00:06:12.176
wanting to be musicians, you
know, wanting to be whatever.

00:06:12.536 --> 00:06:15.296
But they still will have this
perspective on how they look

00:06:15.296 --> 00:06:19.536
at the world, and that will inform
any discipline that they go into.

00:06:21.836 --> 00:06:24.216
&gt;&gt;Well, I think at the kind of
heart of everything we're doing is,

00:06:24.216 --> 00:06:27.396
we're trying to help kids
understand how to be in charge

00:06:27.396 --> 00:06:30.846
of their own learning, and
continue to grow as learners

00:06:30.846 --> 00:06:33.686
across their whole life, because we
just understand that's critically

00:06:33.686 --> 00:06:34.496
important these days.

00:06:34.496 --> 00:06:37.496
These kids are not gonna graduate,
enter a job and be in that job

00:06:37.556 --> 00:06:38.756
for the rest of their lives.

00:06:38.856 --> 00:06:39.906
They're gonna need
to be able to adapt.

00:06:40.526 --> 00:06:42.446
They're gonna have to learn
new things constantly.

00:06:42.716 --> 00:06:45.796
And so that's the type of learner
that we're looking to graduate.
