00:00:02.380 --> 00:00:04.310
FEMALE SPEAKER: Thanks
everyone for coming.

00:00:04.310 --> 00:00:08.070
I'm just going to introduce
Ruth here.

00:00:08.070 --> 00:00:11.550
I've personally been connected
with AJWS, the American Jewish

00:00:11.550 --> 00:00:15.180
World Service, for a
number of years.

00:00:15.180 --> 00:00:17.930
I did a volunteer trip in El
Salvador with them many years

00:00:17.930 --> 00:00:21.490
ago, helping post-earthquake
relief reconstruction.

00:00:21.490 --> 00:00:26.930
That's one of the many, many
projects that AJWS organizes.

00:00:26.930 --> 00:00:30.510
And so I was thrilled when I was
contacted by AJWS telling

00:00:30.510 --> 00:00:34.140
me that Ruth wanted to come and
speak with us about many

00:00:34.140 --> 00:00:36.600
of the more recent projects
they've been involved with.

00:00:36.600 --> 00:00:40.430
So today we're mostly talking
about their work in India, as

00:00:40.430 --> 00:00:44.820
you've all seen an invite.

00:00:44.820 --> 00:00:46.310
I'll just give it to Ruth.

00:00:46.310 --> 00:00:47.520
RUTH MESSINGER: Thank you.

00:00:47.520 --> 00:00:50.260
I am delighted both for all you
here in the room and for

00:00:50.260 --> 00:00:51.680
all of you that are on remote.

00:00:51.680 --> 00:00:54.230
It's a really wonderful
opportunity for me to be able

00:00:54.230 --> 00:00:55.710
to talk with a lot of you.

00:00:55.710 --> 00:00:56.650
I'm Ruth Messinger.

00:00:56.650 --> 00:00:59.540
I have the privilege
of running American

00:00:59.540 --> 00:01:00.350
Jewish World Service.

00:01:00.350 --> 00:01:03.290
And I'm based in New York, but
Laura Thomas is the executive

00:01:03.290 --> 00:01:05.900
director in the San Francisco
office and Spencer Katz is on

00:01:05.900 --> 00:01:07.430
the staff in the San
Francisco office.

00:01:07.430 --> 00:01:10.200
So we are here as well.

00:01:10.200 --> 00:01:11.660
We're going to just--

00:01:11.660 --> 00:01:13.730
feel free to look at the slides
at any point that you

00:01:13.730 --> 00:01:14.560
might want.

00:01:14.560 --> 00:01:18.160
I'm not talking to them
specifically, but it's just a

00:01:18.160 --> 00:01:21.110
loop of photographs that show
both some of our work around

00:01:21.110 --> 00:01:25.440
the world on site in various
communities and the grassroots

00:01:25.440 --> 00:01:26.730
activists that we support.

00:01:26.730 --> 00:01:29.120
And also, I think there's some
pictures of the advocacy that

00:01:29.120 --> 00:01:32.980
we do in this country targeted
to members of Congress to get

00:01:32.980 --> 00:01:35.080
them to change policies.

00:01:35.080 --> 00:01:36.670
I want to give you an
introduction to American

00:01:36.670 --> 00:01:39.520
Jewish World Service generally,
and then talk, as

00:01:39.520 --> 00:01:42.570
Anya promised, about
our work in India.

00:01:42.570 --> 00:01:45.040
Let me just start with
one Indian story.

00:01:45.040 --> 00:01:46.510
And we'll come back to
that at the end.

00:01:46.510 --> 00:01:49.300
This is about a woman
named Zinat.

00:01:49.300 --> 00:01:53.820
Zinat, when she was 17 years
old, had already been divorced

00:01:53.820 --> 00:01:56.750
three times, all from
managers that were

00:01:56.750 --> 00:01:59.130
made against her will.

00:01:59.130 --> 00:02:02.680
She was first married right
after puberty, which I'm sorry

00:02:02.680 --> 00:02:07.220
to tell you is sometimes late,
to a man who abused her.

00:02:07.220 --> 00:02:10.979
And then she was abused in her
two subsequent marriages.

00:02:10.979 --> 00:02:12.390
She had never been
to a doctor.

00:02:12.390 --> 00:02:15.290
And she didn't know-- and this
is really quite common for us

00:02:15.290 --> 00:02:16.510
around the world--

00:02:16.510 --> 00:02:19.480
that actually she lives in a
country, in this case India,

00:02:19.480 --> 00:02:21.280
in which there's a good law.

00:02:21.280 --> 00:02:24.030
So there's a law in India, the
Protection of Women from

00:02:24.030 --> 00:02:25.640
Domestic Violence Act.

00:02:25.640 --> 00:02:28.540
It was passed in 2005.

00:02:28.540 --> 00:02:31.330
And that law should have
protected her from the abuse,

00:02:31.330 --> 00:02:34.600
but obviously if she doesn't
know about it, the cultural

00:02:34.600 --> 00:02:36.900
practices don't change
that quickly.

00:02:36.900 --> 00:02:39.790
So what happened was that Zinat
came to the office of

00:02:39.790 --> 00:02:42.120
one of our grantee organizations
that's called

00:02:42.120 --> 00:02:44.650
the Shaheen Resource
Centre for Women.

00:02:44.650 --> 00:02:49.350
And it works in Hyderabad
in the old city.

00:02:49.350 --> 00:02:52.430
And it's targeted specifically
to help Muslim women-- so this

00:02:52.430 --> 00:02:56.250
is a large Muslim population
in a Hindu country--

00:02:56.250 --> 00:02:57.640
and Dalit women.

00:02:57.640 --> 00:03:01.590
Dalit is the current name for
the lowest caste which used to

00:03:01.590 --> 00:03:02.680
be called the untouchables.

00:03:02.680 --> 00:03:04.990
Some of you obviously
know this.

00:03:04.990 --> 00:03:10.410
So Shaheen with Muslim and Dalit
women and girls against

00:03:10.410 --> 00:03:13.330
gender discrimination and
gender-based violence.

00:03:13.330 --> 00:03:16.980
They helped her negotiate an
agreement with her parents

00:03:16.980 --> 00:03:20.190
that recognized her legal right
to be protected from

00:03:20.190 --> 00:03:23.780
both domestic violence
and forced marriage.

00:03:23.780 --> 00:03:26.890
They referred her to a doctor
who checked for pregnancy and

00:03:26.890 --> 00:03:28.990
sexually transmitted diseases.

00:03:28.990 --> 00:03:31.410
And most importantly, of course,
they provided her with

00:03:31.410 --> 00:03:33.910
vocational training that
allowed her to become

00:03:33.910 --> 00:03:37.200
financially independent, less
likely to fall victim to the

00:03:37.200 --> 00:03:39.040
same situation again.

00:03:39.040 --> 00:03:42.890
And now she's in a position,
which is where Shaheen is

00:03:42.890 --> 00:03:46.800
trying to get many women, that
she both has an economic

00:03:46.800 --> 00:03:51.060
independence and if at any point
she chooses or wants to

00:03:51.060 --> 00:03:54.150
marry again, she has the
support of her family.

00:03:54.150 --> 00:03:56.790
She knows she has the ability
to leave an abusive marriage

00:03:56.790 --> 00:03:57.960
if she chooses.

00:03:57.960 --> 00:03:59.550
She knows what her rights are.

00:03:59.550 --> 00:04:01.660
And she knows how to
access services.

00:04:01.660 --> 00:04:04.420
So that's like a capsule
story of what we're

00:04:04.420 --> 00:04:05.550
doing around the world.

00:04:05.550 --> 00:04:11.650
We are an American-based
non-governmental organization

00:04:11.650 --> 00:04:15.510
that describes ourselves as
being inspired by the Jewish

00:04:15.510 --> 00:04:19.529
commitment to pursue justice,
but working to realize human

00:04:19.529 --> 00:04:24.560
rights and to end poverty for
the most marginalized people

00:04:24.560 --> 00:04:26.550
in the developing world.

00:04:26.550 --> 00:04:34.100
We support a large number, 550
small, usually grassroots

00:04:34.100 --> 00:04:37.260
social justice organizations
in Africa, Asia, and the

00:04:37.260 --> 00:04:42.310
Americas, targeted
to 19 countries.

00:04:42.310 --> 00:04:48.040
They particularly affect the
lives of women and girls,

00:04:48.040 --> 00:04:52.930
migrants and refugees, and
the LGBTI population.

00:04:52.930 --> 00:04:57.890
And the thematic areas in which
they work are to promote

00:04:57.890 --> 00:05:02.850
recovery from conflict and
disasters; to defend access to

00:05:02.850 --> 00:05:06.240
food, land, and livelihoods,
so agricultural

00:05:06.240 --> 00:05:09.440
sustainability; and to advance
the rights of women and girls,

00:05:09.440 --> 00:05:13.075
which is what we were
talking about.

00:05:13.075 --> 00:05:17.810
The way we think about our work
is that we are supporting

00:05:17.810 --> 00:05:21.140
rights that people by and large
in this country take for

00:05:21.140 --> 00:05:24.180
granted, the right to education,
the right to health

00:05:24.180 --> 00:05:27.800
care, the right to be free to
speak our minds, the right to

00:05:27.800 --> 00:05:31.260
vote in elections, the right
to love whom we choose, and

00:05:31.260 --> 00:05:35.640
frankly the right to live, we
hope, without violence and

00:05:35.640 --> 00:05:39.680
rape and discrimination, and
then very importantly, from

00:05:39.680 --> 00:05:42.010
the livelihoods point of view,
the right for people to till

00:05:42.010 --> 00:05:43.720
their own land.

00:05:43.720 --> 00:05:47.780
Those rights are, as I said
before, not recognized in many

00:05:47.780 --> 00:05:51.810
of these countries, or sadly
they're recognized in print

00:05:51.810 --> 00:05:54.830
but they're not recognized
in reality.

00:05:54.830 --> 00:06:00.730
And what we do and what we are
really good at is finding

00:06:00.730 --> 00:06:02.260
these grassroots partners.

00:06:02.260 --> 00:06:05.410
So I want to sort of take a
moment and clarify for you,

00:06:05.410 --> 00:06:08.970
because many of you know very,
very good international relief

00:06:08.970 --> 00:06:10.950
and development organizations.

00:06:10.950 --> 00:06:12.325
We do do some relief work.

00:06:12.325 --> 00:06:14.270
And I'll talk about
that briefly.

00:06:14.270 --> 00:06:17.360
But we are a distinguished from
almost any other western

00:06:17.360 --> 00:06:19.800
or American organization that
you might know of that works

00:06:19.800 --> 00:06:21.690
in the developing world
because we don't

00:06:21.690 --> 00:06:24.200
send western staff.

00:06:24.200 --> 00:06:27.070
So we can find a group, we can
sometimes find a group that

00:06:27.070 --> 00:06:30.540
starts with a grant literally
of $2,000 or $3,000.

00:06:30.540 --> 00:06:33.490
Our average gift over
many, many years is

00:06:33.490 --> 00:06:35.840
around $30,000 a year.

00:06:35.840 --> 00:06:37.980
And that is an amount
of money--

00:06:37.980 --> 00:06:40.740
invested in local people who
have their own vision of

00:06:40.740 --> 00:06:42.990
justice and are doing their own
work, that's an amount of

00:06:42.990 --> 00:06:48.040
money to change the lives of a
community in many very, very

00:06:48.040 --> 00:06:48.880
dramatic ways.

00:06:48.880 --> 00:06:51.670
And sometimes our organizations
grow to a point

00:06:51.670 --> 00:06:53.760
where they're highly visible,
they're known

00:06:53.760 --> 00:06:55.150
in the public world.

00:06:55.150 --> 00:06:58.960
We were the first funder of
Leymah Gbowee, the Liberian

00:06:58.960 --> 00:07:01.520
woman who won the Nobel Peace
Prize two years ago for the

00:07:01.520 --> 00:07:04.990
works that she did to bring
peace to Liberia.

00:07:04.990 --> 00:07:07.390
But to be honest with you, most
of our organizations are

00:07:07.390 --> 00:07:09.580
not going to win the
Nobel Peace Prize.

00:07:09.580 --> 00:07:12.750
But they are advancing and
changing the status for people

00:07:12.750 --> 00:07:16.730
who live in some of the most
difficult parts of the world.

00:07:16.730 --> 00:07:18.570
So I do want to talk
about India.

00:07:18.570 --> 00:07:21.820
But I want to just say
two other things

00:07:21.820 --> 00:07:23.220
about our work in general.

00:07:23.220 --> 00:07:25.090
We take monitoring
and evaluation of

00:07:25.090 --> 00:07:26.330
our work very seriously.

00:07:26.330 --> 00:07:28.940
So we hold our project partners,
our very grassroots

00:07:28.940 --> 00:07:31.340
partners, accountable for
the work they do.

00:07:31.340 --> 00:07:34.370
And we stay with them
for a long time.

00:07:34.370 --> 00:07:37.650
And while that is the core of
our work, the grant-making

00:07:37.650 --> 00:07:41.170
work we do overseas, we also
work in this country.

00:07:41.170 --> 00:07:43.940
And in this country we meet
with groups like you.

00:07:43.940 --> 00:07:48.150
We work with people who will
help us on some key advocacy

00:07:48.150 --> 00:07:50.360
issues, because there are areas
in which if the United

00:07:50.360 --> 00:07:53.580
States would change its policy
and practice, things would be

00:07:53.580 --> 00:07:56.610
vastly different not just for
the 550 groups that we work

00:07:56.610 --> 00:07:58.670
with, but for people
all over the world.

00:07:58.670 --> 00:08:02.270
And the most current example
of that is actually in the

00:08:02.270 --> 00:08:03.830
President's budget.

00:08:03.830 --> 00:08:06.900
In the budget that the White
House announced two days ago

00:08:06.900 --> 00:08:12.380
is a provision to move food
aid money out of the

00:08:12.380 --> 00:08:17.060
Department of Agriculture, where
by law, by law, it has

00:08:17.060 --> 00:08:20.830
to be used to buy American
food and ship it tens of

00:08:20.830 --> 00:08:25.660
thousands of miles away, which
takes longer, costs much more,

00:08:25.660 --> 00:08:28.950
and undermines local farmers.

00:08:28.950 --> 00:08:32.280
And so in the budget, 45% of
the food aid money going

00:08:32.280 --> 00:08:37.440
forward, if Congress passes the
budget, would be able to

00:08:37.440 --> 00:08:41.289
be used flexibly for local
procurement of food, which is

00:08:41.289 --> 00:08:45.120
a huge change in-- its a better,
more efficient use of

00:08:45.120 --> 00:08:48.170
our tax dollars, but it's also
a huge investment in

00:08:48.170 --> 00:08:51.470
agricultural sustainability
around the world.

00:08:51.470 --> 00:08:54.450
So some of you know about us
from our disaster work.

00:08:54.450 --> 00:08:57.430
We did substantial work against
the genocide in Darfur

00:08:57.430 --> 00:09:01.670
and continue to work on
peace issues in Sudan.

00:09:01.670 --> 00:09:04.290
We came to many people's
attention after the 2004

00:09:04.290 --> 00:09:09.060
tsunami in South Asia and
more recently after the

00:09:09.060 --> 00:09:09.970
earthquake in Haiti.

00:09:09.970 --> 00:09:13.630
And I'm happy to go back and
talk about any of that work

00:09:13.630 --> 00:09:15.380
later when you get a chance
to ask questions.

00:09:15.380 --> 00:09:19.190
But I want to concentrate
on our work in India.

00:09:19.190 --> 00:09:22.330
So in some ways right now, of
course, India is in the

00:09:22.330 --> 00:09:27.420
spotlight because of the
horrific rape in Delhi and the

00:09:27.420 --> 00:09:31.850
story about the woman who
was raped and died.

00:09:31.850 --> 00:09:35.730
But I suspect, given who you
are and given the wonderful

00:09:35.730 --> 00:09:39.290
place that we're meeting, that
a lot of you sort of think

00:09:39.290 --> 00:09:43.220
about India in the terms in
which the United States and

00:09:43.220 --> 00:09:45.910
the United States economic pages
talk about India these

00:09:45.910 --> 00:09:50.270
days, which is as a hugely
populous country with rapid

00:09:50.270 --> 00:09:54.890
development and a great deal
of money being made and

00:09:54.890 --> 00:09:57.920
invested in-country and a great
deal of new technology

00:09:57.920 --> 00:09:59.230
and new capacity.

00:09:59.230 --> 00:10:02.410
And the problem is that, of
course, all of that is true.

00:10:02.410 --> 00:10:05.480
But it's also a country with an
ever-widening gap between

00:10:05.480 --> 00:10:06.760
its rich and it's poor.

00:10:06.760 --> 00:10:09.100
So at the same time as you
read-- and you might have seen

00:10:09.100 --> 00:10:11.570
some of these stories about
people who are building

00:10:11.570 --> 00:10:15.490
buildings that even in America
would be considered like a

00:10:15.490 --> 00:10:19.380
condominium construct for
10 families with 10 huge

00:10:19.380 --> 00:10:21.600
floor-through apartments, it's
owned by one person.

00:10:21.600 --> 00:10:24.820
He hasn't decided yet whether or
not to move in, but he has,

00:10:24.820 --> 00:10:27.770
I think, it's a 10-, maybe it's
a 12-story building for

00:10:27.770 --> 00:10:28.900
himself and his family.

00:10:28.900 --> 00:10:30.440
So there are those
the excesses.

00:10:30.440 --> 00:10:36.500
But meanwhile there are sort of
two huge problems in this

00:10:36.500 --> 00:10:39.940
country that we've chosen to
devote our attention to.

00:10:39.940 --> 00:10:43.700
One is that some of the efforts
to make money, both to

00:10:43.700 --> 00:10:47.680
develop new areas of cities
and more importantly to

00:10:47.680 --> 00:10:52.650
develop new opportunities for
mining, are displacing people

00:10:52.650 --> 00:10:54.180
from their land.

00:10:54.180 --> 00:11:01.090
So I've actually been in a
semi-urban community in Delhi,

00:11:01.090 --> 00:11:05.100
which is the home where tens
of thousands of people who

00:11:05.100 --> 00:11:07.740
used to live in a slum in Delhi
were simply told, you're

00:11:07.740 --> 00:11:09.240
being relocated.

00:11:09.240 --> 00:11:11.510
And not only are they losing
their homes and therefore

00:11:11.510 --> 00:11:14.680
losing a sense of community, but
these were all people who

00:11:14.680 --> 00:11:18.230
had some sort of job that they
could make their way to.

00:11:18.230 --> 00:11:20.730
And they've now been displaced
to a place on the outskirts of

00:11:20.730 --> 00:11:24.870
the city where the only job for
them is garbage pickers.

00:11:24.870 --> 00:11:27.310
So they go out on the road
and they collect garbage.

00:11:27.310 --> 00:11:29.380
And they bring the garbage into
this rural development

00:11:29.380 --> 00:11:32.220
area and they sort through it,
looking for valuables.

00:11:32.220 --> 00:11:35.180
And when I was there two years
ago, they were at risk of

00:11:35.180 --> 00:11:39.670
losing that one single economic
opportunity because

00:11:39.670 --> 00:11:41.410
it was becoming commercialized.

00:11:41.410 --> 00:11:43.440
So there were now new trucks
that were going to be picking

00:11:43.440 --> 00:11:45.950
up garbage and-- whatever you
do with garbage, chewing it

00:11:45.950 --> 00:11:48.650
all up, but not allowing people
to sort through it.

00:11:48.650 --> 00:11:51.900
And that might sound to all of
us like a great technological

00:11:51.900 --> 00:11:54.400
advance, except it means that
this whole community of

00:11:54.400 --> 00:11:56.720
thousands of people that were
displaced from their homes in

00:11:56.720 --> 00:12:00.130
the city will now have nothing
to sustain themselves and no

00:12:00.130 --> 00:12:02.800
way to get to any job that
might be available.

00:12:02.800 --> 00:12:06.330
So the displacement of the
poorest both urban and rural

00:12:06.330 --> 00:12:09.690
people from their land and
homes due to development,

00:12:09.690 --> 00:12:11.880
industry, and mining
is one big problem.

00:12:11.880 --> 00:12:15.230
And then the second problem,
which I've referenced already,

00:12:15.230 --> 00:12:17.700
is the pervasive discrimination
and violence

00:12:17.700 --> 00:12:21.040
that's perpetrated against women
and girls, against the

00:12:21.040 --> 00:12:25.140
LGBTI population, and against
the sex worker population.

00:12:25.140 --> 00:12:28.030
And you will remind me later
on, be sure I say something

00:12:28.030 --> 00:12:29.450
about sex workers
particularly.

00:12:32.430 --> 00:12:37.840
So here's an example of the
kind of work that we do.

00:12:37.840 --> 00:12:41.040
In Mumbai specifically, where
there is, as I said throughout

00:12:41.040 --> 00:12:44.660
the country, there's a Muslim
population, life is

00:12:44.660 --> 00:12:46.700
particularly difficult
for Muslim women.

00:12:46.700 --> 00:12:49.900
Their traditional gender
roles don't allow

00:12:49.900 --> 00:12:51.470
them to go to school.

00:12:51.470 --> 00:12:56.160
It deprives them of status
in their households.

00:12:56.160 --> 00:13:01.530
They are forced into early
marriage, many of them in

00:13:01.530 --> 00:13:03.400
their teens and some of them
younger than that.

00:13:03.400 --> 00:13:05.330
You might have seen-- this
wasn't India, it was

00:13:05.330 --> 00:13:06.030
Afghanistan.

00:13:06.030 --> 00:13:08.160
But there was a story in The New
York Times two weeks ago

00:13:08.160 --> 00:13:11.800
about a father who sold his
six-year-old daughter into

00:13:11.800 --> 00:13:15.080
marriage as the only way to get
some money for the family

00:13:15.080 --> 00:13:16.595
that was like in desperate
straits.

00:13:20.910 --> 00:13:24.210
International statistics show
that adolescent brides are

00:13:24.210 --> 00:13:26.430
much more likely to be abused.

00:13:26.430 --> 00:13:28.620
They're isolated from
their communities.

00:13:28.620 --> 00:13:31.210
And as I said before, they
don't have any idea that

00:13:31.210 --> 00:13:32.680
there's a law that would
protect them.

00:13:32.680 --> 00:13:35.340
So there's a group we
support in Mumbai.

00:13:35.340 --> 00:13:36.920
It's called Aawaaz-e-Niswaan.

00:13:36.920 --> 00:13:40.640
It's a group that works in the
Muslim community to educate

00:13:40.640 --> 00:13:43.630
girls and to teach them what
their rights are under the

00:13:43.630 --> 00:13:47.740
law, to teach them how to defend
those rights, to teach

00:13:47.740 --> 00:13:50.070
them the dangers of early
marriage and early

00:13:50.070 --> 00:13:52.740
childbearing from a health point
of view and from the

00:13:52.740 --> 00:13:55.550
point of view of interrupting
their education and their

00:13:55.550 --> 00:13:58.250
economic growth potential.

00:13:58.250 --> 00:14:02.980
Girls are taught everything from
self-defense skills to

00:14:02.980 --> 00:14:05.150
ways to become peer educators.

00:14:05.150 --> 00:14:08.150
They're taught how to
express their rights

00:14:08.150 --> 00:14:10.380
against arranged marriages.

00:14:10.380 --> 00:14:14.110
And they're given some skills
for financial independence.

00:14:14.110 --> 00:14:16.880
And they're given vocational
training, access to college

00:14:16.880 --> 00:14:20.700
scholarships, and assistance
in finding jobs.

00:14:20.700 --> 00:14:23.280
And I think one of the strengths
of this group and

00:14:23.280 --> 00:14:25.620
one of the reasons why I thought
to include them in

00:14:25.620 --> 00:14:29.510
this presentation is they
represent what American Jewish

00:14:29.510 --> 00:14:31.050
World Service is all about.

00:14:31.050 --> 00:14:33.010
They see the problem.

00:14:33.010 --> 00:14:35.270
They figured out the solution.

00:14:35.270 --> 00:14:37.960
And they saw that the solution
couldn't just be

00:14:37.960 --> 00:14:39.390
uni-dimensional.

00:14:39.390 --> 00:14:42.090
It's not just stay in school.

00:14:42.090 --> 00:14:45.650
It's not just tell people what
the law is and try to get them

00:14:45.650 --> 00:14:46.350
legal defenders.

00:14:46.350 --> 00:14:49.650
It's like you have to work on
this issue on a variety of

00:14:49.650 --> 00:14:50.880
different levels at once.

00:14:50.880 --> 00:14:53.350
And from our point of
view, ideally we'll

00:14:53.350 --> 00:14:54.180
do that with groups.

00:14:54.180 --> 00:14:56.410
But we'll also hope that some
of the groups that we are

00:14:56.410 --> 00:14:59.300
supporting we'll be preferencing
education, peer

00:14:59.300 --> 00:15:01.220
education, and empowerment.

00:15:01.220 --> 00:15:04.350
Some of them will be emphasizing
teaching young

00:15:04.350 --> 00:15:07.190
women some degree of financial
literacy and financial

00:15:07.190 --> 00:15:10.030
independence, since that turns
out to be one of the things

00:15:10.030 --> 00:15:13.160
they need in order to be able
to stand their ground.

00:15:13.160 --> 00:15:15.450
And it for sure involves
teaching

00:15:15.450 --> 00:15:17.330
basic leadership skills.

00:15:17.330 --> 00:15:21.210
So working on all of these
different fronts, we see that

00:15:21.210 --> 00:15:25.470
the alumni, the graduates of
Aawaaz-e-Niswaan are really

00:15:25.470 --> 00:15:27.610
key leaders now in
their community.

00:15:27.610 --> 00:15:30.050
And they are joining in the
effort that you may have read

00:15:30.050 --> 00:15:33.170
about in India recently of women
standing up and saying,

00:15:33.170 --> 00:15:37.310
we have to end this essentially
right to rape

00:15:37.310 --> 00:15:39.600
which is so prevalent
in our society.

00:15:39.600 --> 00:15:44.740
So in December the staff and the
alumni of Aawaaz-e-Niswaan

00:15:44.740 --> 00:15:49.760
was significantly involved in
organizing around the country

00:15:49.760 --> 00:15:52.320
against rape and for
a violence-free

00:15:52.320 --> 00:15:53.200
environment for women.

00:15:53.200 --> 00:15:55.910
And make no mistake about
it, this change

00:15:55.910 --> 00:15:57.680
will occur very slowly.

00:15:57.680 --> 00:16:00.290
But we're able with each of
these groups that we fund to

00:16:00.290 --> 00:16:03.170
help them evaluate what they're
doing and then to help

00:16:03.170 --> 00:16:07.230
them work with each other to
evaluate any success in moving

00:16:07.230 --> 00:16:10.260
the needle on the broad
questions of human rights and

00:16:10.260 --> 00:16:12.240
governance in-country.

00:16:12.240 --> 00:16:14.540
And about India specifically,
I would say it's

00:16:14.540 --> 00:16:15.430
sort of for me a mix.

00:16:15.430 --> 00:16:19.300
The good news is that it's a
comparatively, comparatively

00:16:19.300 --> 00:16:22.650
given where we work, stable
democracy that does have laws

00:16:22.650 --> 00:16:23.700
on the books.

00:16:23.700 --> 00:16:26.230
And the challenge right now is
that not only people don't

00:16:26.230 --> 00:16:28.580
know those laws, but that people
in this country think

00:16:28.580 --> 00:16:31.330
that India has solved
all its problems.

00:16:31.330 --> 00:16:33.670
And that's to all people who
visit, stay in five-star

00:16:33.670 --> 00:16:36.440
hotels, they think that there
seem to be a lot of poor

00:16:36.440 --> 00:16:38.680
people in the streets but that's
not really the story.

00:16:38.680 --> 00:16:40.720
A lot of people know that that's
where their call center

00:16:40.720 --> 00:16:43.160
is and that everything
must be fine.

00:16:43.160 --> 00:16:46.290
So it's a country that's in
a sense at risk of being

00:16:46.290 --> 00:16:49.870
redefined as a developed world
country when that is

00:16:49.870 --> 00:16:52.630
just not its story.

00:16:52.630 --> 00:16:55.960
OK, I wanted to just say a
little bit about sex work,

00:16:55.960 --> 00:16:57.610
because I'd like to see
if I could possibly be

00:16:57.610 --> 00:17:01.520
controversial before we
turn to questions.

00:17:01.520 --> 00:17:04.890
So we work with an organization,
a couple of

00:17:04.890 --> 00:17:06.450
organizations in
India and other

00:17:06.450 --> 00:17:08.220
organizations around the world.

00:17:08.220 --> 00:17:11.680
And we differ from many people
you know in that we make a

00:17:11.680 --> 00:17:17.290
distinction between trafficking
and sex work.

00:17:17.290 --> 00:17:19.240
And that distinction
is not common.

00:17:19.240 --> 00:17:21.810
And sometimes it's commonly
understood that there's a

00:17:21.810 --> 00:17:24.010
difference, but people
see them the same.

00:17:24.010 --> 00:17:26.670
So I just want to say that we
work against trafficking.

00:17:26.670 --> 00:17:29.900
We work against child soldiers
in Uganda and Ghana.

00:17:29.900 --> 00:17:31.560
We work against child
slaves in the

00:17:31.560 --> 00:17:33.320
fishing industry in Ghana.

00:17:33.320 --> 00:17:36.640
We work against trafficked
women all over.

00:17:36.640 --> 00:17:41.190
But there are women in this
world, including in India, who

00:17:41.190 --> 00:17:45.560
have chosen sex work as the best
way for them to make a

00:17:45.560 --> 00:17:47.400
living and support
their families.

00:17:47.400 --> 00:17:49.690
They're not owned by pimps.

00:17:49.690 --> 00:17:51.090
They are not the trafficked
women who are

00:17:51.090 --> 00:17:52.460
moved across borders.

00:17:52.460 --> 00:17:57.910
They have decided that that is
the way to create an income

00:17:57.910 --> 00:17:58.440
for themselves.

00:17:58.440 --> 00:18:00.490
It's not the choice that you
would make or you would make

00:18:00.490 --> 00:18:01.640
or I would make.

00:18:01.640 --> 00:18:05.780
But we do believe in serious
empowerment by people of their

00:18:05.780 --> 00:18:07.340
own futures.

00:18:07.340 --> 00:18:11.270
And these women organize and get
funding from us to protect

00:18:11.270 --> 00:18:15.000
their own health, to stop
themselves from being abused

00:18:15.000 --> 00:18:20.670
by the local police, and to be
sure that nobody comes in, as

00:18:20.670 --> 00:18:22.920
it were, to sort
of buy them up.

00:18:22.920 --> 00:18:26.120
But they have chosen to do
sex work as a profession.

00:18:26.120 --> 00:18:29.820
And we are part of a small
network of funding

00:18:29.820 --> 00:18:33.090
organizations around the world
called the Red Umbrella Fund

00:18:33.090 --> 00:18:36.620
which supports women who are sex
workers by choice and not

00:18:36.620 --> 00:18:38.380
trafficked women.

00:18:38.380 --> 00:18:40.980
So one of the groups we
support in India is an

00:18:40.980 --> 00:18:45.970
organization called Sangram,
which works specifically on

00:18:45.970 --> 00:18:49.770
behalf of sex workers in India
in order to basically, as I

00:18:49.770 --> 00:18:53.340
said, insist that their clients
use condoms, provide

00:18:53.340 --> 00:18:57.160
access to health care, and get
protection from the police if

00:18:57.160 --> 00:19:00.110
they are raped as opposed to
actually selling their

00:19:00.110 --> 00:19:02.230
services to somebody.

00:19:02.230 --> 00:19:05.100
So that's a very quick snapshot
of work we do in

00:19:05.100 --> 00:19:07.760
India, which is actually
paralleled by work we do all

00:19:07.760 --> 00:19:09.070
over the world.

00:19:09.070 --> 00:19:11.500
India is the country
for us with our

00:19:11.500 --> 00:19:13.950
largest number of grantees.

00:19:13.950 --> 00:19:15.710
Of course, that's partly
because of its size.

00:19:15.710 --> 00:19:17.990
But it also means that it
offers us a significant

00:19:17.990 --> 00:19:21.050
opportunity for these groups to
be working with each other,

00:19:21.050 --> 00:19:23.640
for these groups to be
collaborating and learning

00:19:23.640 --> 00:19:27.210
those organizing, mobilizing
advocacy techniques that will

00:19:27.210 --> 00:19:31.340
help them make change
countrywide, which is our

00:19:31.340 --> 00:19:32.590
vision, with them.

00:19:32.590 --> 00:19:34.510
It's their vision and therefore
is our vision for

00:19:34.510 --> 00:19:36.500
their future.

00:19:36.500 --> 00:19:40.410
So that's the story, starting
with Zinat and ending with two

00:19:40.410 --> 00:19:42.360
or three organizations that
I hope give you a

00:19:42.360 --> 00:19:43.720
flavor of what we do.

00:19:43.720 --> 00:19:45.940
But I would love to take
your questions and

00:19:45.940 --> 00:19:47.930
challenges about anything.

00:19:47.930 --> 00:19:49.180
Yeah.

00:19:55.550 --> 00:19:57.570
AUDIENCE: Googlers like to think
of themselves as being

00:19:57.570 --> 00:19:59.070
data-driven.

00:19:59.070 --> 00:20:02.550
And a lot of people give their
money to organizations

00:20:02.550 --> 00:20:05.580
recommended by GiveWell,
for example.

00:20:05.580 --> 00:20:08.480
I was interested you're
mentioning holding grantees

00:20:08.480 --> 00:20:11.770
accountable, doing
evaluations.

00:20:11.770 --> 00:20:13.540
Could you please say
more about that?

00:20:13.540 --> 00:20:14.670
RUTH MESSINGER: Sure.

00:20:14.670 --> 00:20:18.420
First of all, we have very high
ratings, highest ratings

00:20:18.420 --> 00:20:20.690
from the American Institute
of Philanthropy, Charity

00:20:20.690 --> 00:20:23.140
Navigator, and the Better
Business Bureau.

00:20:23.140 --> 00:20:24.630
And we pride ourselves
on that.

00:20:24.630 --> 00:20:28.240
Second of all, we've grown
a lot in the last--

00:20:28.240 --> 00:20:29.250
we're 28 years old.

00:20:29.250 --> 00:20:32.210
Most of our growth has been
in the last 14 years.

00:20:32.210 --> 00:20:35.990
And I say that to say we've gone
from being a $2.8 million

00:20:35.990 --> 00:20:38.700
organization to a $51 million
organization.

00:20:38.700 --> 00:20:41.980
And in the process, we have been
thinking and rethinking

00:20:41.980 --> 00:20:44.260
our approach to monitoring
and evaluation.

00:20:44.260 --> 00:20:46.470
So we've always done monitoring
and evaluation for

00:20:46.470 --> 00:20:48.350
an individual grantee.

00:20:48.350 --> 00:20:51.130
And we basically have done it,
and quite successfully, I want

00:20:51.130 --> 00:20:54.470
to say, by asking a grass roots
organization that we

00:20:54.470 --> 00:20:57.740
were thinking of funding, for
them to tell us what would

00:20:57.740 --> 00:21:01.610
they do with, fill in the blank,
$15,000, helping them

00:21:01.610 --> 00:21:05.200
list the goals, usually helping
them take away half

00:21:05.200 --> 00:21:07.750
the goals, because they are much
more certain that they

00:21:07.750 --> 00:21:10.610
can do more than they could
possibly do, and attaching

00:21:10.610 --> 00:21:12.520
metrics to some of them.

00:21:12.520 --> 00:21:15.030
And then we've evaluated that
on an ongoing basis.

00:21:15.030 --> 00:21:19.060
We are the kind of evaluators
that say, we really, really

00:21:19.060 --> 00:21:19.760
want the truth.

00:21:19.760 --> 00:21:22.150
We have grants officers in
our New York office.

00:21:22.150 --> 00:21:24.010
We have in-country
consultants.

00:21:24.010 --> 00:21:26.810
We want you to really tell us
when you're being successful

00:21:26.810 --> 00:21:29.230
and when you're not, because we
are not going to take away

00:21:29.230 --> 00:21:30.900
your money at the first
opportunity.

00:21:30.900 --> 00:21:33.120
We're interested in if something
isn't working, why

00:21:33.120 --> 00:21:34.440
is it not working?

00:21:34.440 --> 00:21:38.570
That was the structure for
evaluation that we used for

00:21:38.570 --> 00:21:39.950
the first 10 years
that I was there.

00:21:39.950 --> 00:21:42.940
For the last four years, we've
invested much more heavily in

00:21:42.940 --> 00:21:46.080
just exactly what you're asking
about, looking for the

00:21:46.080 --> 00:21:49.400
most useful kind of independent
data, teaching

00:21:49.400 --> 00:21:53.400
monitoring and evaluation,
trying to help groups use the

00:21:53.400 --> 00:21:57.520
data that they collect for us
in a feedback loop to figure

00:21:57.520 --> 00:22:00.290
out what they need to be doing
differently to improve the

00:22:00.290 --> 00:22:02.120
numbers or decrease
the numbers.

00:22:02.120 --> 00:22:05.460
And now we have to set up a
department of strategic

00:22:05.460 --> 00:22:07.510
learning, research,
and evaluation.

00:22:07.510 --> 00:22:11.510
And they will work both on
monitoring and evaluating our

00:22:11.510 --> 00:22:13.690
in-country work-- so how
successful are we in

00:22:13.690 --> 00:22:17.500
Washington, what happens with
the President's budget , how

00:22:17.500 --> 00:22:20.390
many members of Congress votes
do we actually change?--

00:22:20.390 --> 00:22:24.520
to also adding a new overlay of
work on our international

00:22:24.520 --> 00:22:27.400
grant-making, particularly where
I described, like are we

00:22:27.400 --> 00:22:31.130
moving the needle on a human
rights issue outside of just

00:22:31.130 --> 00:22:34.440
the work we're doing with the
particular organization?

00:22:34.440 --> 00:22:38.510
In India, in Kenya, five years
from now will it be evident

00:22:38.510 --> 00:22:41.060
that many more people know what
their rights are under

00:22:41.060 --> 00:22:44.970
these supposedly good laws on
the books against gender-based

00:22:44.970 --> 00:22:46.700
violence and how will
they do that?

00:22:46.700 --> 00:22:47.590
AUDIENCE: Thank you.

00:22:47.590 --> 00:22:50.160
AUDIENCE: I personally know of
many small organizations in

00:22:50.160 --> 00:22:54.680
India that work to improve
the status of women, of

00:22:54.680 --> 00:22:56.840
impoverished people.

00:22:56.840 --> 00:23:00.230
How do you go and partner with
an organization, because I

00:23:00.230 --> 00:23:00.850
know of so many.

00:23:00.850 --> 00:23:02.690
And they're all doing small
things in small

00:23:02.690 --> 00:23:03.680
parts of the country.

00:23:03.680 --> 00:23:04.350
It's a huge country.

00:23:04.350 --> 00:23:06.550
RUTH MESSINGER: So it's a
perfect question, because our

00:23:06.550 --> 00:23:10.670
notion is both to find those
small groups, pick the best,

00:23:10.670 --> 00:23:13.430
but then grow them into a larger
movement, because as

00:23:13.430 --> 00:23:16.240
you said, you can have some
great small groups scattered

00:23:16.240 --> 00:23:19.800
around, sometimes their problem
is just a lack of

00:23:19.800 --> 00:23:21.210
consistency of resources.

00:23:21.210 --> 00:23:24.250
So they have a great plan, but
as you all know, if you spend

00:23:24.250 --> 00:23:26.610
all your life looking for money,
you don't have much

00:23:26.610 --> 00:23:27.980
time to do your program.

00:23:27.980 --> 00:23:30.820
So first of all, how we find
the organizations is we are

00:23:30.820 --> 00:23:33.260
getting better and better known
in the countries where

00:23:33.260 --> 00:23:38.030
we work as the go-to place for
grassroots groups that have a

00:23:38.030 --> 00:23:39.150
vision of change.

00:23:39.150 --> 00:23:41.040
Second of all, I described
us as a human rights

00:23:41.040 --> 00:23:42.500
organization.

00:23:42.500 --> 00:23:45.570
Our staff, our in-country
consultants who help us find

00:23:45.570 --> 00:23:49.020
and monitor projects and our
program officers, take this

00:23:49.020 --> 00:23:50.890
notion of human rights
very seriously.

00:23:50.890 --> 00:23:52.240
But I just want to
be clear to you.

00:23:52.240 --> 00:23:54.780
It doesn't mean that some little
grassroots group that

00:23:54.780 --> 00:23:57.650
like wants to bring girls
together has to say, we have a

00:23:57.650 --> 00:24:00.390
right to education and we have
the Universal Declaration.

00:24:00.390 --> 00:24:02.560
It's the way in which people
talk about it.

00:24:02.560 --> 00:24:03.660
It's like we're doing a lot.

00:24:03.660 --> 00:24:06.800
We are actually the eighth
largest funder of LGBTI work

00:24:06.800 --> 00:24:09.580
period, in the world, which is
wonderful for us and really

00:24:09.580 --> 00:24:12.540
embarrassing for the world.

00:24:12.540 --> 00:24:15.840
But it's how do those people
talk about their human rights?

00:24:15.840 --> 00:24:19.250
They have made in some cases
unbelievably brave decisions

00:24:19.250 --> 00:24:21.880
to come out of the closet,
to find each other, to be

00:24:21.880 --> 00:24:25.150
challenging laws that
are pretty serious.

00:24:25.150 --> 00:24:27.300
And they basically, when you
listen to them, they say look,

00:24:27.300 --> 00:24:29.630
we just did this secretly
as long as we could.

00:24:29.630 --> 00:24:31.230
But we have a right too.

00:24:31.230 --> 00:24:32.650
So it's the use of
that language.

00:24:32.650 --> 00:24:34.320
It's that sensitivity.

00:24:34.320 --> 00:24:36.950
And the reason for that is
because those groups are more

00:24:36.950 --> 00:24:38.230
sustainable.

00:24:38.230 --> 00:24:41.030
If you're sort of a-- and I
don't want to criticize this,

00:24:41.030 --> 00:24:43.740
but if you're sort of an
organization that does work

00:24:43.740 --> 00:24:48.330
when somebody funds you, that's
less reliable for long

00:24:48.330 --> 00:24:50.700
term social change in the world
than if you just say, we

00:24:50.700 --> 00:24:52.100
have a right to this.

00:24:52.100 --> 00:24:53.660
And when Leymah Gbowee,
the woman I

00:24:53.660 --> 00:24:55.800
referenced from Liberia--

00:24:55.800 --> 00:24:59.640
her success was in organizing
women to end the war, end the

00:24:59.640 --> 00:25:02.970
civil war in Liberia, and demand
the peace process,

00:25:02.970 --> 00:25:05.050
which she did by, among
other things, the

00:25:05.050 --> 00:25:06.215
women went on sex strikes.

00:25:06.215 --> 00:25:08.550
So if you think that only
happens in ancient Greece, you

00:25:08.550 --> 00:25:11.820
need to brush up on your recent
Liberian history.

00:25:11.820 --> 00:25:14.970
But when she did that, frankly
at the end of that time she

00:25:14.970 --> 00:25:16.280
was like a hero.

00:25:16.280 --> 00:25:18.390
And she had five children.

00:25:18.390 --> 00:25:21.040
And people said, OK, you've done
wonders for our country,

00:25:21.040 --> 00:25:23.000
go back and take care
of your children.

00:25:23.000 --> 00:25:24.025
And she was like outraged.

00:25:24.025 --> 00:25:25.750
She was like, what are
you talking about?

00:25:25.750 --> 00:25:28.450
I just proved that you can bring
together Muslim women

00:25:28.450 --> 00:25:29.190
and Christian women.

00:25:29.190 --> 00:25:33.870
You can make women stand up
to and control the idiotic

00:25:33.870 --> 00:25:36.860
behavior of men-- that's the
way she talks about it.

00:25:36.860 --> 00:25:39.860
And I want to go and teach the
girls in this country and in

00:25:39.860 --> 00:25:42.230
neighboring countries how
to assert their rights.

00:25:42.230 --> 00:25:44.620
And we were the only people
who would fund here.

00:25:44.620 --> 00:25:46.780
Everybody else was like, you
did a great job, go home.

00:25:46.780 --> 00:25:49.010
And what my staff said was, this
is a woman who's going to

00:25:49.010 --> 00:25:50.720
set the world on fire.

00:25:50.720 --> 00:25:52.750
And we need to support
her efforts.

00:25:52.750 --> 00:25:54.490
So I think there's that.

00:25:54.490 --> 00:25:58.690
And then I think the benefit
for us now of focusing and

00:25:58.690 --> 00:26:02.530
deepening our work in these 19
countries will be precisely,

00:26:02.530 --> 00:26:05.320
and let's take India as an
example, to bring these

00:26:05.320 --> 00:26:06.820
different groups together.

00:26:06.820 --> 00:26:08.680
And one of the things that
happens when you bring

00:26:08.680 --> 00:26:10.520
together groups that are working
on the same issue,

00:26:10.520 --> 00:26:12.800
especially in a country as large
as India, they don't

00:26:12.800 --> 00:26:14.210
know each other.

00:26:14.210 --> 00:26:16.430
And so they have no idea that
someone is working on

00:26:16.430 --> 00:26:18.290
something similar in
the next town.

00:26:18.290 --> 00:26:21.470
And they have no idea that
somebody thinks the first

00:26:21.470 --> 00:26:23.660
thing to do with girls is to
educate them about their human

00:26:23.660 --> 00:26:25.930
rights and somebody else thinks
that the first thing to

00:26:25.930 --> 00:26:29.030
do with girls is to educate
them about their bodies.

00:26:29.030 --> 00:26:31.510
And these groups, we bring
them together.

00:26:31.510 --> 00:26:35.430
And they are so empowered,
because they are the experts.

00:26:35.430 --> 00:26:38.730
It's not like we brought
together 10 groups in Kenya to

00:26:38.730 --> 00:26:42.050
hear from a Western expert about
the rights of girls.

00:26:42.050 --> 00:26:44.210
It's like this group is talking
about what they do and

00:26:44.210 --> 00:26:46.620
this group is talking about--
and they're like, you want us

00:26:46.620 --> 00:26:49.980
to put on an hour-long program
talking about what we do?

00:26:49.980 --> 00:26:51.980
And so that's the effort.

00:26:51.980 --> 00:26:55.550
And then the next effort is,
including with probably lots

00:26:55.550 --> 00:26:59.390
of the groups you're familiar
with, is to play ball with

00:26:59.390 --> 00:27:01.690
some of the other international
funders and say,

00:27:01.690 --> 00:27:06.010
what can we do within the
structure of what these women

00:27:06.010 --> 00:27:08.030
want anyway or these
people want anyway?

00:27:08.030 --> 00:27:11.228
What can we do to help build
larger movements?

00:27:11.228 --> 00:27:12.470
Yes?

00:27:12.470 --> 00:27:15.520
AUDIENCE: My question was
there's a lot of support-- how

00:27:15.520 --> 00:27:17.650
do you address the culture
problems, thought?

00:27:17.650 --> 00:27:25.400
Because I might know my rights,
but it's not easy--

00:27:25.400 --> 00:27:26.820
to give an example, I
know growing up--

00:27:26.820 --> 00:27:31.260
I'm from a very I guess
relatively modern family, but

00:27:31.260 --> 00:27:33.170
I was always told good
girls get married

00:27:33.170 --> 00:27:34.260
before the age of 20.

00:27:34.260 --> 00:27:35.270
And I did.

00:27:35.270 --> 00:27:39.830
And after a broken engagement,
because of dowry demands--

00:27:39.830 --> 00:27:43.420
and I'm not one of the
girls you see there.

00:27:43.420 --> 00:27:46.860
But I know my friends who have
been divorced have had

00:27:46.860 --> 00:27:49.930
problems getting admission
to their girls in school.

00:27:49.930 --> 00:27:52.075
So it's not that they don't know
their rights and know the

00:27:52.075 --> 00:27:53.830
girls have a right
to education.

00:27:53.830 --> 00:27:56.970
But because this is a divorced
mother, has enough financial

00:27:56.970 --> 00:28:00.280
support, doesn't get admission
for her child in school, where

00:28:00.280 --> 00:28:01.520
do they go?

00:28:01.520 --> 00:28:03.500
Because they're aware
of their rights.

00:28:03.500 --> 00:28:03.860
RUTH MESSINGER: OK.

00:28:03.860 --> 00:28:06.600
So that's like a brilliant
question.

00:28:06.600 --> 00:28:08.630
And I was hoping some of you had
some experience with this.

00:28:08.630 --> 00:28:11.390
So I want to say this
is the area where we

00:28:11.390 --> 00:28:12.660
tread the most carefully.

00:28:12.660 --> 00:28:16.370
There's proven no value in
Westerners coming in and

00:28:16.370 --> 00:28:17.400
saying, you have a
right to this.

00:28:17.400 --> 00:28:18.140
You can do that.

00:28:18.140 --> 00:28:20.640
Just sign up here and then
here's your future.

00:28:20.640 --> 00:28:23.540
And it turns out to be a bad
future, because you dared to

00:28:23.540 --> 00:28:25.050
exercise your rights.

00:28:25.050 --> 00:28:27.580
But what we find is that
people are doing

00:28:27.580 --> 00:28:28.960
this on their own.

00:28:28.960 --> 00:28:30.210
So they're stepping forward.

00:28:30.210 --> 00:28:32.300
So take the example you
said, yes, I think

00:28:32.300 --> 00:28:33.440
that's a perfect example.

00:28:33.440 --> 00:28:35.980
Some women are exercising their
rights because they know

00:28:35.980 --> 00:28:36.800
their rights.

00:28:36.800 --> 00:28:40.090
And then they're getting out
of bad marriages or excess

00:28:40.090 --> 00:28:43.320
dowry demands or abusive
situations.

00:28:43.320 --> 00:28:45.020
And then they have
no place to turn.

00:28:45.020 --> 00:28:47.480
And what we find, though, is
that they're coming together

00:28:47.480 --> 00:28:48.080
with each other.

00:28:48.080 --> 00:28:51.580
They're saying this is a policy
that has to be changed.

00:28:51.580 --> 00:28:53.650
And I want to be
really honest.

00:28:53.650 --> 00:28:57.010
I see that, particularly from
the point of view of the

00:28:57.010 --> 00:29:00.450
people in this room and in our
organization, change in these

00:29:00.450 --> 00:29:01.970
areas comes slowly.

00:29:01.970 --> 00:29:05.320
But all I know is it doesn't
come at all if Westerners come

00:29:05.320 --> 00:29:06.840
in and say, oh, you should
just do this or

00:29:06.840 --> 00:29:07.930
you should do that.

00:29:07.930 --> 00:29:09.970
So I'll tell you our most
exciting story.

00:29:09.970 --> 00:29:13.200
It's not yet in India on this
issue, although this is an

00:29:13.200 --> 00:29:16.520
issue we hope to tackle there
very soon in a big way.

00:29:16.520 --> 00:29:21.160
But we funded, starting 15 years
ago, an organization in

00:29:21.160 --> 00:29:25.010
Senegal that was organizing--

00:29:25.010 --> 00:29:28.200
at that point they were
organizing literacy

00:29:28.200 --> 00:29:29.500
programs for women.

00:29:29.500 --> 00:29:32.090
And then they were organizing,
by their own request, a

00:29:32.090 --> 00:29:34.970
program for women to learn
about health care.

00:29:34.970 --> 00:29:39.900
But in 1998, that turned into
one of the women in one of

00:29:39.900 --> 00:29:43.150
those health care groups saying,
if health care is a

00:29:43.150 --> 00:29:46.800
human right, then why do we
practice female genital

00:29:46.800 --> 00:29:50.770
cutting, which has hurt many
of us, has destroyed the

00:29:50.770 --> 00:29:51.910
health of our daughters,
and has

00:29:51.910 --> 00:29:53.540
killed some of our children?

00:29:53.540 --> 00:29:55.510
And they organized from
the ground up.

00:29:55.510 --> 00:30:00.460
And I can't give you a story
like this every day, but there

00:30:00.460 --> 00:30:03.420
are now 2,200 villages in
Senegal that have banned

00:30:03.420 --> 00:30:04.810
female genital cutting.

00:30:04.810 --> 00:30:05.980
There's a law on the books.

00:30:05.980 --> 00:30:08.710
They're training people
in other countries.

00:30:08.710 --> 00:30:11.510
They've gotten several imams
to support them, which is

00:30:11.510 --> 00:30:14.460
critical to the kind of longer
term cultural change you're

00:30:14.460 --> 00:30:18.600
talking about, imams who now
say, it is not true that this

00:30:18.600 --> 00:30:21.570
is a requirement in the Quran,
which is what all of these

00:30:21.570 --> 00:30:22.860
women believed.

00:30:22.860 --> 00:30:24.730
So I wish it was faster
than that.

00:30:24.730 --> 00:30:26.490
And I think your example
is perfect.

00:30:26.490 --> 00:30:30.810
Women who exercise their rights
then run into new

00:30:30.810 --> 00:30:31.710
stumbling blocks.

00:30:31.710 --> 00:30:36.830
But we have, in a sense for me,
there's a benefit to sort

00:30:36.830 --> 00:30:39.440
of following the lead of the
people on the ground.

00:30:39.440 --> 00:30:43.780
So we're not telling them, if
you do this, all will be fine.

00:30:43.780 --> 00:30:46.200
We are picking up with them
where they say, several women

00:30:46.200 --> 00:30:47.820
here actually chose
to exercise their

00:30:47.820 --> 00:30:48.820
rights under the law.

00:30:48.820 --> 00:30:50.900
And now they can't get their
children into school.

00:30:50.900 --> 00:30:52.660
So that's the next step.

00:30:52.660 --> 00:30:55.230
And so how do you help us?

00:30:55.230 --> 00:30:58.600
How do you help us organize to
kind of make that change?

00:30:58.600 --> 00:31:00.160
And it's complicated for sure.

00:31:00.160 --> 00:31:02.220
So you described
it eloquently.

00:31:02.220 --> 00:31:05.130
But they set the next threshold
in and next

00:31:05.130 --> 00:31:07.260
challenge and the
next horizon.

00:31:07.260 --> 00:31:11.040
I'll just tell you a personal
story that I love.

00:31:11.040 --> 00:31:13.520
Last time I was at
Aawaaz-e-Niswaan, the Muslim

00:31:13.520 --> 00:31:16.410
group that I talked to you
about, they brought in about

00:31:16.410 --> 00:31:19.220
20 young girls who were in
there, they were learning--

00:31:19.220 --> 00:31:21.420
literally it was a class they
were learning to write poetry

00:31:21.420 --> 00:31:22.210
about their lives.

00:31:22.210 --> 00:31:24.630
But they were also being
educated about their rights.

00:31:24.630 --> 00:31:26.210
And they were fascinated
to have all

00:31:26.210 --> 00:31:27.570
these Westerners there.

00:31:27.570 --> 00:31:29.980
So they asked some questions
about, is their domestic

00:31:29.980 --> 00:31:30.980
violence in the West?

00:31:30.980 --> 00:31:33.630
And then they asked, there were
two or three men in our

00:31:33.630 --> 00:31:36.100
group, so they said, we've never
had a man come to hear

00:31:36.100 --> 00:31:37.490
about what we're doing.

00:31:37.490 --> 00:31:40.892
And then finally, this one young
woman puts up here hand.

00:31:40.892 --> 00:31:43.880
And she says, I hear that in
the United States, it's

00:31:43.880 --> 00:31:47.700
possible for people of the same
sex to love each other.

00:31:47.700 --> 00:31:50.400
I mean, it was like probably the
guttiest question asked in

00:31:50.400 --> 00:31:54.050
Mumbai in the last decade.

00:31:54.050 --> 00:31:59.810
And so the person who was
talking from our group said,

00:31:59.810 --> 00:32:01.670
yes, that is true.

00:32:01.670 --> 00:32:05.840
And I suddenly realized that I
had a picture, a photograph in

00:32:05.840 --> 00:32:08.890
my wallet of my daughter and
my daughter-in-law, who are

00:32:08.890 --> 00:32:11.320
not the same race, with
their daughter.

00:32:11.320 --> 00:32:12.790
And so I said to the
young woman, here.

00:32:12.790 --> 00:32:13.900
You might want to
look at this.

00:32:13.900 --> 00:32:15.630
This is a married couple.

00:32:15.630 --> 00:32:17.390
And these women pass this
photograph around.

00:32:17.390 --> 00:32:20.290
It was like in tatters by
the end of an hour.

00:32:20.290 --> 00:32:22.110
So it's like that
kind of story.

00:32:22.110 --> 00:32:26.350
It's very slow efforts
at cultural change.

00:32:28.910 --> 00:32:32.340
And that will not make gay
marriage legal in the United

00:32:32.340 --> 00:32:35.410
States, much less in
Mumbai tomorrow.

00:32:35.410 --> 00:32:36.610
But it's progress.

00:32:36.610 --> 00:32:37.560
AUDIENCE: So I think it's
building a little

00:32:37.560 --> 00:32:38.240
bit on what you asked.

00:32:38.240 --> 00:32:41.160
I think even if women know their
rights, I think it's

00:32:41.160 --> 00:32:43.360
hard for them to stand up to
their brothers and their

00:32:43.360 --> 00:32:45.080
fathers and all of this.

00:32:45.080 --> 00:32:47.600
How much do you guys, or how
have you guys thought about

00:32:47.600 --> 00:32:51.000
educating not just the women
but the parents and the

00:32:51.000 --> 00:32:54.370
siblings and other people that
are willing to help?

00:32:54.370 --> 00:32:55.460
RUTH MESSINGER: The answer
is absolutely.

00:32:55.460 --> 00:32:57.650
And that's the kind of question
that we'll ask a

00:32:57.650 --> 00:32:59.460
group that we're
about to fund.

00:32:59.460 --> 00:33:01.950
OK, so it sounds like you really
have a determined plan

00:33:01.950 --> 00:33:04.110
to sort of bring in girls
and do this and do that.

00:33:04.110 --> 00:33:06.360
But we'll say, it's sort of like
the example I gave you,

00:33:06.360 --> 00:33:08.800
we might say, we know of another
group where they're

00:33:08.800 --> 00:33:13.290
trying to share this education
with men or with parents.

00:33:13.290 --> 00:33:16.700
And it's a question of when
they're ready to take it on.

00:33:16.700 --> 00:33:20.340
So I want to be--

00:33:20.340 --> 00:33:22.240
we were meeting yesterday-- we
were meeting yesterday?-- with

00:33:22.240 --> 00:33:25.220
a-- no, that was the night
before, sorry-- with a donor.

00:33:25.220 --> 00:33:27.880
And the exciting thing was,
an American donor, but her

00:33:27.880 --> 00:33:29.980
background is in cultural
anthropology.

00:33:29.980 --> 00:33:32.230
So she hasn't been in
school in, with all

00:33:32.230 --> 00:33:33.280
due respect, 30 years.

00:33:33.280 --> 00:33:36.080
But she got it.

00:33:36.080 --> 00:33:38.650
And so it's very touch and go.

00:33:38.650 --> 00:33:41.340
But those issues, that fits with
what I'm talking about

00:33:41.340 --> 00:33:42.345
with larger evaluation.

00:33:42.345 --> 00:33:44.620
If those big changes are going
to be made, there's a whole

00:33:44.620 --> 00:33:46.430
lot of men who have
to be involved.

00:33:46.430 --> 00:33:48.510
There's a whole lot of parents
who have to be involved.

00:33:48.510 --> 00:33:51.470
And sometimes it's looking for
that person who will stand up

00:33:51.470 --> 00:33:53.480
and say, I actually did this.

00:33:53.480 --> 00:33:57.340
So the story that I told at
the beginning of Zinat,

00:33:57.340 --> 00:34:01.130
Shaheen went and educated her
parents and said, like, sort

00:34:01.130 --> 00:34:03.130
of nicely, could you-- but
it's not me doing it.

00:34:03.130 --> 00:34:06.335
It's the organization that I
fund calling on that father

00:34:06.335 --> 00:34:08.870
and saying, your daughter is 17
and she's been in 3 abusive

00:34:08.870 --> 00:34:10.500
relationships.

00:34:10.500 --> 00:34:12.320
That can't be what you wish
for your daughter.

00:34:12.320 --> 00:34:13.980
And of course, sometimes you
run into a brick wall.

00:34:13.980 --> 00:34:15.260
Sorry, that's what
I have to do.

00:34:15.260 --> 00:34:17.630
But sometimes, you'll find the
people are ready to make

00:34:17.630 --> 00:34:19.440
social change.

00:34:19.440 --> 00:34:20.520
AUDIENCE: How do you handle--

00:34:20.520 --> 00:34:21.909
like, I'm from India.

00:34:21.909 --> 00:34:25.780
And I know corruption is
so deep-seated that--

00:34:25.780 --> 00:34:29.139
I mean, we see it every day
when you grow up there.

00:34:29.139 --> 00:34:32.250
How do you handle corruption,
a, when you

00:34:32.250 --> 00:34:33.889
invest with these groups?

00:34:33.889 --> 00:34:37.000
But also even if you
educate women--

00:34:37.000 --> 00:34:41.239
in the Delhi rape case, the
police were standing by and

00:34:41.239 --> 00:34:42.650
doing nothing.

00:34:42.650 --> 00:34:44.380
It's not just family support.

00:34:44.380 --> 00:34:49.219
You need the government or
the law enforcers or--

00:34:49.219 --> 00:34:51.600
even knowing your rights is not
enough if there's nobody

00:34:51.600 --> 00:34:54.030
to enforce that you get it.

00:34:54.030 --> 00:34:56.590
So can you speak to how
you deal with that?

00:34:56.590 --> 00:34:56.740
RUTH MESSINGER: Right.

00:34:56.740 --> 00:34:58.635
So the first half is easy.

00:34:58.635 --> 00:35:02.710
Seriously, the first half of
your question, by and large

00:35:02.710 --> 00:35:05.340
for the amounts that we invest
and the care with which we

00:35:05.340 --> 00:35:08.800
determine the amount and the
fact that we're supporting

00:35:08.800 --> 00:35:11.300
grassroots groups and we're not
going through governments,

00:35:11.300 --> 00:35:14.120
we run into almost none of the
corruption that you are

00:35:14.120 --> 00:35:15.030
correct exists.

00:35:15.030 --> 00:35:18.650
And that's significant, because
I have a grants budget

00:35:18.650 --> 00:35:20.060
I'm happy to say
of $15 million.

00:35:20.060 --> 00:35:23.000
The United States probably
has a grant budget of

00:35:23.000 --> 00:35:25.190
$15 million an hour.

00:35:25.190 --> 00:35:29.610
But most of their budget,
including in places where they

00:35:29.610 --> 00:35:32.600
really want to make a
difference, starts at the top

00:35:32.600 --> 00:35:34.650
with government and ministries
and whatever.

00:35:34.650 --> 00:35:37.000
And it doesn't get ever
to the people that

00:35:37.000 --> 00:35:37.930
we're finding directly.

00:35:37.930 --> 00:35:42.520
So I find that really because
of the incredible grassroots

00:35:42.520 --> 00:35:45.800
and bottom-up work that we're
doing, we have only literally

00:35:45.800 --> 00:35:48.680
in a handful of cases in the
last 14 years that I've been

00:35:48.680 --> 00:35:53.500
there run into corruption by
heads of organizations.

00:35:53.500 --> 00:35:56.645
And in most of those cases, I
actually wouldn't describe it

00:35:56.645 --> 00:35:57.250
as corruption.

00:35:57.250 --> 00:36:00.830
I would describe it as getting
too much Western money with

00:36:00.830 --> 00:36:03.350
too many strings attached and
making it too hard for them to

00:36:03.350 --> 00:36:06.020
figure out how to do it, so they
were running their own--

00:36:06.020 --> 00:36:08.360
not with our money, which is
usually general operating

00:36:08.360 --> 00:36:10.750
support, but then another group
would find them and fund

00:36:10.750 --> 00:36:11.590
them to run a program.

00:36:11.590 --> 00:36:13.170
And then a third group would
find them and fund them.

00:36:13.170 --> 00:36:15.650
And they just didn't understand
what I have to

00:36:15.650 --> 00:36:18.290
learn every day, which is the
mechanisms of being responsive

00:36:18.290 --> 00:36:19.890
to donors and not--

00:36:19.890 --> 00:36:20.200
OK.

00:36:20.200 --> 00:36:21.210
So that part is easy.

00:36:21.210 --> 00:36:24.360
The other part is like this
gigantic challenge.

00:36:24.360 --> 00:36:29.590
And it's not so different from
the questions that you were

00:36:29.590 --> 00:36:33.490
asking, like those changes are
only going to come-- and it's

00:36:33.490 --> 00:36:36.360
hard to sort of say this-- but
when one of those empowered

00:36:36.360 --> 00:36:40.530
women decides to become the
local panchayat or challenge

00:36:40.530 --> 00:36:41.450
the local panchayat.

00:36:41.450 --> 00:36:45.440
My favorite story was a town in
which for some reason the

00:36:45.440 --> 00:36:47.000
Indian government decided--

00:36:47.000 --> 00:36:48.790
this is like 10 years ago--

00:36:48.790 --> 00:36:51.240
to bring television to some of
these rural communities.

00:36:51.240 --> 00:36:54.490
And so there was like the notion
of find a community,

00:36:54.490 --> 00:36:56.770
like a center in town, and
put the TV there, so

00:36:56.770 --> 00:36:57.990
people can watch it.

00:36:57.990 --> 00:37:00.360
And a group of women that we
were already funding to do

00:37:00.360 --> 00:37:03.355
microfinance discovered that the
panchayat had taken-- this

00:37:03.355 --> 00:37:05.300
is the local government officer,
for those of you who

00:37:05.300 --> 00:37:06.300
aren't Indian--

00:37:06.300 --> 00:37:10.140
who had taken the television and
put it in his own house.

00:37:10.140 --> 00:37:13.360
So they organized and one
morning at 7:00 AM he opened

00:37:13.360 --> 00:37:14.970
the door and there were
40 women sitting in

00:37:14.970 --> 00:37:15.680
front of his house.

00:37:15.680 --> 00:37:16.540
And he said, what are
you doing here?

00:37:16.540 --> 00:37:18.520
And they said, we're staying
here until you move the

00:37:18.520 --> 00:37:19.620
television.

00:37:19.620 --> 00:37:21.610
So it's like when is that
going to happen?

00:37:21.610 --> 00:37:25.550
And I want to say, I'm so
respectful of the work you do

00:37:25.550 --> 00:37:28.870
here and the universes that
you've built, I wish

00:37:28.870 --> 00:37:31.380
it was as easy as--

00:37:31.380 --> 00:37:34.100
but that's the way the
change occurs.

00:37:34.100 --> 00:37:38.900
I do have a donor who's a donor
of ours who is also on

00:37:38.900 --> 00:37:41.600
his own-- we just manage the
money for him-- but investing

00:37:41.600 --> 00:37:45.340
heavily in trying to change
corruption in the police

00:37:45.340 --> 00:37:48.370
departments in rural Kenya
and not in India.

00:37:48.370 --> 00:37:50.150
And I'm working with
him all the time.

00:37:50.150 --> 00:37:53.090
And I like what he's doing and
I'm happy to move that money

00:37:53.090 --> 00:37:55.500
for him, because it makes
my bank account larger.

00:37:55.500 --> 00:37:57.900
But I think he and I would
be the first to agree.

00:37:57.900 --> 00:38:00.020
Once you get to that level,
it's really difficult.

00:38:00.020 --> 00:38:01.730
Are you sure you have
a good person?

00:38:01.730 --> 00:38:03.450
And if you are-- and by
the way, this is an

00:38:03.450 --> 00:38:04.400
issue that I have too.

00:38:04.400 --> 00:38:07.650
You might have a good police
chief and I might have a great

00:38:07.650 --> 00:38:12.660
head of an NGO, but then much is
dependent on them and their

00:38:12.660 --> 00:38:14.670
strength and their staying
in place and their

00:38:14.670 --> 00:38:16.390
not becoming corrupted.

00:38:16.390 --> 00:38:18.200
So I think you gave
great examples.

00:38:18.200 --> 00:38:20.690
And all I will say is I
particularly learned from

00:38:20.690 --> 00:38:24.380
working with these sex workers,
they are fierce.

00:38:24.380 --> 00:38:26.950
So I'll tell you a story.

00:38:26.950 --> 00:38:32.300
We had a volunteer who went with
us to Uganda and worked

00:38:32.300 --> 00:38:34.890
for a labor rights organization
in Uganda.

00:38:34.890 --> 00:38:37.710
And he got to know a group which
was an organization of

00:38:37.710 --> 00:38:38.370
sex workers.

00:38:38.370 --> 00:38:41.260
So we were funding them mostly
to make sure that they had

00:38:41.260 --> 00:38:42.870
good health care.

00:38:42.870 --> 00:38:46.490
But they described to us and
then they described to this

00:38:46.490 --> 00:38:51.300
young man, who was a lawyer by
training, that their problem

00:38:51.300 --> 00:38:52.510
was the police.

00:38:52.510 --> 00:38:56.730
The police would show up and
say, we know that you're

00:38:56.730 --> 00:38:57.890
selling sex for money.

00:38:57.890 --> 00:38:58.880
And we're not paying.

00:38:58.880 --> 00:39:00.280
We just want the sex.

00:39:00.280 --> 00:39:02.520
And they were both demanding it
for no money and they were

00:39:02.520 --> 00:39:03.110
abusing them.

00:39:03.110 --> 00:39:05.330
And they were being violent.

00:39:05.330 --> 00:39:07.910
So it was exactly what the
women didn't want.

00:39:07.910 --> 00:39:11.880
So this young lawyer
talked to them.

00:39:11.880 --> 00:39:13.550
And he said, OK, look.

00:39:13.550 --> 00:39:15.100
This is like a long shot.

00:39:15.100 --> 00:39:16.980
I don't think this will work.

00:39:16.980 --> 00:39:19.630
You'll never bring a criminal
case successfully against any

00:39:19.630 --> 00:39:22.820
of those people, but because
of Ugandan law, we might be

00:39:22.820 --> 00:39:24.510
able to bring a civil case.

00:39:24.510 --> 00:39:28.950
So what I need you to do is,
when a police officer shows up

00:39:28.950 --> 00:39:31.210
and does that, I can't stop them
from doing it, but if you

00:39:31.210 --> 00:39:35.070
can get his name and his badge
number and just collect these

00:39:35.070 --> 00:39:38.170
over the next few months, then
we'll bring a civil case.

00:39:38.170 --> 00:39:39.580
So they said OK.

00:39:39.580 --> 00:39:41.670
And then he didn't hear
from them at all.

00:39:41.670 --> 00:39:43.460
So he thought it
hadn't worked.

00:39:43.460 --> 00:39:45.450
So after like 2 and 1/2 months,
he called them.

00:39:45.450 --> 00:39:47.850
And he said, I thought we were
going to collaborate in this

00:39:47.850 --> 00:39:48.940
civil suit.

00:39:48.940 --> 00:39:51.460
And they said, oh, our
problems are over.

00:39:51.460 --> 00:39:53.000
And he said, what do you mean
your problems are over?

00:39:53.000 --> 00:39:55.860
And they said, when the police
show up, we say, you know, we

00:39:55.860 --> 00:39:56.680
have a camera.

00:39:56.680 --> 00:39:57.740
You don't know where it is.

00:39:57.740 --> 00:39:59.460
They said, we don't have a
camera but we tell them we

00:39:59.460 --> 00:40:00.470
have a camera.

00:40:00.470 --> 00:40:03.090
And we're writing down your
names and your badge numbers.

00:40:03.090 --> 00:40:04.890
And we have a lawyer who's going
to sue you all and name

00:40:04.890 --> 00:40:06.050
you in the local newspaper.

00:40:06.050 --> 00:40:08.920
And they went away.

00:40:08.920 --> 00:40:11.380
So this guy feels like he
solved the problems of

00:40:11.380 --> 00:40:13.760
corruption in Uganda.

00:40:13.760 --> 00:40:15.640
But I mean, that's the
kind of initiative.

00:40:15.640 --> 00:40:18.610
And I mean, I'm very fortunate
to have this job.

00:40:18.610 --> 00:40:20.540
But I keep hearing it come
up from the bottom.

00:40:20.540 --> 00:40:22.730
And look, it's terrible.

00:40:22.730 --> 00:40:25.110
I could tell you horrendous
problems.

00:40:25.110 --> 00:40:27.930
One of the countries I was in in
the past year was Cambodia.

00:40:27.930 --> 00:40:30.705
And in Cambodia, they pay
teachers so little that, first

00:40:30.705 --> 00:40:33.590
of all, they don't come to work
so the school structure

00:40:33.590 --> 00:40:34.870
isn't what it looks like.

00:40:34.870 --> 00:40:36.460
And second of all, they
demand sexual

00:40:36.460 --> 00:40:38.120
favors from their students.

00:40:38.120 --> 00:40:40.480
Now I'm not going to be able
to stop that tomorrow.

00:40:40.480 --> 00:40:44.020
But it's building a group that
just sort of stands up

00:40:44.020 --> 00:40:45.210
someplace and says, enough.

00:40:45.210 --> 00:40:46.820
We're not taking this anymore.

00:40:46.820 --> 00:40:49.370
And we do know that those people
have been successful in

00:40:49.370 --> 00:40:53.100
history, including for
sure in India.

00:40:53.100 --> 00:40:55.364
AUDIENCE: Thank you.

00:40:55.364 --> 00:40:56.540
FEMALE SPEAKER: Does
anyone who's on

00:40:56.540 --> 00:40:58.950
the GVC have a question?

00:40:58.950 --> 00:40:59.742
AUDIENCE: Can I ask
a question?

00:40:59.742 --> 00:41:00.980
FEMALE SPEAKER: Yeah, please.

00:41:00.980 --> 00:41:01.315
AUDIENCE: Hi.

00:41:01.315 --> 00:41:02.930
It's very nice to
meet you, Ruth.

00:41:02.930 --> 00:41:05.970
I get a lot of emails from
American Jewish World Service,

00:41:05.970 --> 00:41:08.926
and I have two friends that are
actually in India, working

00:41:08.926 --> 00:41:11.630
with the AJWS right now.

00:41:11.630 --> 00:41:12.400
RUTH MESSINGER: Wonderful.

00:41:12.400 --> 00:41:14.010
AUDIENCE: I'm actually leaving
for India tonight.

00:41:14.010 --> 00:41:15.345
RUTH MESSINGER: All right.

00:41:15.345 --> 00:41:16.670
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

00:41:16.670 --> 00:41:18.070
I'm very excited.

00:41:18.070 --> 00:41:21.560
And one thing that I struggle
with a little bit is that

00:41:21.560 --> 00:41:24.970
especially working at Google,
where we're very focused on

00:41:24.970 --> 00:41:28.220
connecting people around the
world, and bringing Google

00:41:28.220 --> 00:41:31.060
services to people around the
world because it unlocks

00:41:31.060 --> 00:41:33.690
knowledge, which turns into
power and [INAUDIBLE]

00:41:33.690 --> 00:41:38.530
information, I sometimes feel
that there's a concept of

00:41:38.530 --> 00:41:41.890
well, these people in these
remote countries are so far

00:41:41.890 --> 00:41:42.300
away from me.

00:41:42.300 --> 00:41:43.330
What could I ever do?

00:41:43.330 --> 00:41:44.555
I live in the United States.

00:41:44.555 --> 00:41:47.450
And I know I'm lucky to have all
these things, but there's

00:41:47.450 --> 00:41:49.690
not much I can do personally.

00:41:49.690 --> 00:41:52.860
As I'm going on this trip, or
for anyone else that has an

00:41:52.860 --> 00:41:55.370
upcoming trip to one of these
countries you're talking

00:41:55.370 --> 00:42:00.060
about, what can you recommend
upon returning, actions that

00:42:00.060 --> 00:42:02.660
we can take in just
our daily lives?

00:42:02.660 --> 00:42:02.920
RUTH MESSINGER: OK.

00:42:02.920 --> 00:42:06.372
Don't tell people how much I
paid you to ask this question

00:42:06.372 --> 00:42:09.200
at this particular
point in time.

00:42:09.200 --> 00:42:10.950
So I think there's
several things

00:42:10.950 --> 00:42:11.990
that are really important.

00:42:11.990 --> 00:42:15.310
One is really pay attention,
you yourself, I don't know

00:42:15.310 --> 00:42:19.050
you, but to like what you're
seeing and how it impacts you,

00:42:19.050 --> 00:42:21.440
because bringing back for those
people who didn't grow

00:42:21.440 --> 00:42:23.450
up in another country or haven't
travelled, bringing

00:42:23.450 --> 00:42:27.040
back the descriptions, you have
to be careful, because

00:42:27.040 --> 00:42:29.830
some of it threatens just
to overwhelm people.

00:42:29.830 --> 00:42:31.090
And then they think there's
nothing I can do.

00:42:31.090 --> 00:42:34.300
But on the other hand, people
haven't seen the dimensions of

00:42:34.300 --> 00:42:39.050
poverty, oppression, hunger that
you may see some of, that

00:42:39.050 --> 00:42:41.480
you'll learn from your friends
who are over there.

00:42:41.480 --> 00:42:45.455
So part of it is just sort of
coming back as a reporter as

00:42:45.455 --> 00:42:46.550
to what you've seen.

00:42:46.550 --> 00:42:49.490
But ideally, we're talking
about coming back as a

00:42:49.490 --> 00:42:53.120
reporter of not only what you
saw in the problems, but what

00:42:53.120 --> 00:42:56.060
you see as these change
agent organizations.

00:42:56.060 --> 00:42:58.430
I mean, we run study
tours every year.

00:42:58.430 --> 00:43:00.920
And part of the reason for that
is that I've learned that

00:43:00.920 --> 00:43:05.230
I can talk a lot, and I do, and
tell stories, which I try

00:43:05.230 --> 00:43:09.670
to do, but seeing it really
changes people's understanding

00:43:09.670 --> 00:43:12.530
of the fact that solutions come
from the grassroots, of

00:43:12.530 --> 00:43:15.750
the fact that relatively little
money that we're giving

00:43:15.750 --> 00:43:18.380
to these organizations makes
dramatic change.

00:43:18.380 --> 00:43:20.790
But then when you come
back, it's--

00:43:20.790 --> 00:43:23.700
and I'll push a little bit--
it's to take on three roles.

00:43:23.700 --> 00:43:25.500
One is educating your friends.

00:43:25.500 --> 00:43:27.390
And since you're at Google,
you all have

00:43:27.390 --> 00:43:28.660
this amazing network.

00:43:28.660 --> 00:43:30.760
So it's literally do a blog.

00:43:30.760 --> 00:43:32.610
If it's a great blog,
we'll publish it.

00:43:32.610 --> 00:43:33.690
But do a blog.

00:43:33.690 --> 00:43:34.910
Sort of say, here's
what I saw.

00:43:34.910 --> 00:43:36.210
Here's what I learned.

00:43:36.210 --> 00:43:38.670
Here are the kinds of groups
that I understand are making a

00:43:38.670 --> 00:43:39.050
difference.

00:43:39.050 --> 00:43:41.580
So it's community education.

00:43:41.580 --> 00:43:44.380
Two is, of course I will
mention donations.

00:43:44.380 --> 00:43:47.700
And I just want to
say carefully--

00:43:47.700 --> 00:43:51.320
and this came up in an early
question, but pay attention.

00:43:51.320 --> 00:43:54.870
There are groups that are
doing just spectacular

00:43:54.870 --> 00:43:57.300
advertising to get you to give
them money and they have

00:43:57.300 --> 00:44:01.110
terrible scores from the
rating agencies.

00:44:01.110 --> 00:44:03.230
The rating agencies are
far from perfect.

00:44:03.230 --> 00:44:04.730
They know that they are
far from perfect.

00:44:04.730 --> 00:44:06.890
They know that they don't
measure enough about impact,

00:44:06.890 --> 00:44:08.140
just what your question was.

00:44:08.140 --> 00:44:10.470
But they're rating for at
least decent financial

00:44:10.470 --> 00:44:11.060
management.

00:44:11.060 --> 00:44:14.090
And I have people all the time
who say, oh, well, if I were

00:44:14.090 --> 00:44:16.300
going to give to you, I'd have
to stop giving to my favorite

00:44:16.300 --> 00:44:19.760
charity, which is X. And I can
sometimes say, have you ever

00:44:19.760 --> 00:44:20.940
looked up that charity?

00:44:20.940 --> 00:44:23.000
They're like spending all their
money writing you for

00:44:23.000 --> 00:44:24.730
more money.

00:44:24.730 --> 00:44:26.190
And those are all rated.

00:44:26.190 --> 00:44:29.240
So it's like to think about
giving and giving

00:44:29.240 --> 00:44:29.800
thoughtfully.

00:44:29.800 --> 00:44:33.690
And please don't think, which
you alluded to correctly,

00:44:33.690 --> 00:44:41.190
don't think it's
just my money.

00:44:41.190 --> 00:44:42.090
I can't do enough.

00:44:42.090 --> 00:44:43.650
I can't make a difference.

00:44:43.650 --> 00:44:46.160
Don't think this is
so overwhelming.

00:44:46.160 --> 00:44:48.950
I mean, if I would say anything
to all of us as

00:44:48.950 --> 00:44:52.670
Americans, as Google employees,
it's we don't have

00:44:52.670 --> 00:44:55.810
the luxury of retreating
to being overwhelmed.

00:44:55.810 --> 00:44:58.070
We actually each have the
capacity to make a difference.

00:44:58.070 --> 00:45:01.270
Small amounts of money make
a big difference.

00:45:01.270 --> 00:45:03.700
And the third thing that you
can do is get involved,

00:45:03.700 --> 00:45:07.770
hopefully with us, but really
with anybody on advocacy.

00:45:07.770 --> 00:45:10.250
The United States spends
our tax dollars doing

00:45:10.250 --> 00:45:13.380
international development
work rather poorly.

00:45:13.380 --> 00:45:16.080
They spend that money for
geopolitical purposes.

00:45:16.080 --> 00:45:17.100
I'm in favor of that.

00:45:17.100 --> 00:45:19.020
I would like us to have good
standing in the world.

00:45:19.020 --> 00:45:20.500
I'd like us to have friends.

00:45:20.500 --> 00:45:21.430
But it's not--

00:45:21.430 --> 00:45:23.930
whatever they tell you, it's
unfortunately not money that's

00:45:23.930 --> 00:45:25.830
usually going to help
poor people.

00:45:25.830 --> 00:45:28.420
And so that's why in a sense
you need to look for

00:45:28.420 --> 00:45:31.440
additional charities and
targeted dollars and need to

00:45:31.440 --> 00:45:32.220
look at their ratings.

00:45:32.220 --> 00:45:35.400
But it's also why you have to
work to change US policy.

00:45:35.400 --> 00:45:36.920
So we would be happy--

00:45:36.920 --> 00:45:38.460
we'll pass around a
piece of paper.

00:45:38.460 --> 00:45:41.860
You can tell Anya if any of you
want to be on our website

00:45:41.860 --> 00:45:45.470
or whatever, it's not painful.

00:45:45.470 --> 00:45:46.800
You're all good at
communicating.

00:45:46.800 --> 00:45:49.800
But right now, we need people
to be lobbying members of

00:45:49.800 --> 00:45:51.560
Congress on this
budget change.

00:45:51.560 --> 00:45:53.250
This is huge.

00:45:53.250 --> 00:45:56.880
And I promise you that a change
in where food dollars

00:45:56.880 --> 00:45:59.830
are going is not going to be
on the front pages of "The

00:45:59.830 --> 00:46:02.280
Chronicle" or "The New York
Times" in the next month I

00:46:02.280 --> 00:46:02.730
don't think.

00:46:02.730 --> 00:46:04.150
I wish it were.

00:46:04.150 --> 00:46:06.150
We actually get quoted
in these articles.

00:46:06.150 --> 00:46:07.940
We got quoted in "The
Manchester Guardian"

00:46:07.940 --> 00:46:10.220
yesterday, which is
like big deal.

00:46:10.220 --> 00:46:15.070
But there's a lot of talk about
tax cuts and cuts to

00:46:15.070 --> 00:46:16.130
entitlement programs.

00:46:16.130 --> 00:46:18.020
And that's where the debate
is going to be.

00:46:18.020 --> 00:46:20.830
But if the United States can
really under the State

00:46:20.830 --> 00:46:24.890
Department spend money flexibly
to buy food from

00:46:24.890 --> 00:46:28.120
local farmers, it could make a
huge difference in key parts

00:46:28.120 --> 00:46:29.010
of the world.

00:46:29.010 --> 00:46:33.070
So it's educate others, think
wisely about contributing.

00:46:33.070 --> 00:46:35.950
And it's become an advocate
for change.

00:46:35.950 --> 00:46:41.410
And I will tell you, because
it motivates me, a few

00:46:41.410 --> 00:46:44.580
teachings, not surprisingly
right now these happen to be

00:46:44.580 --> 00:46:45.350
Jewish teachings.

00:46:45.350 --> 00:46:48.600
But they're pretty applicable
to the whole world.

00:46:48.600 --> 00:46:52.750
So there's a famous social
justice oriented rabbi of the

00:46:52.750 --> 00:46:56.640
20th century who said in a free
society where terrible

00:46:56.640 --> 00:47:01.770
wrongs exist, some are guilty,
but all are responsible.

00:47:01.770 --> 00:47:05.080
And then there's a long ago
Jewish teaching that says you

00:47:05.080 --> 00:47:09.060
are not required to complete the
task, but you can't refuse

00:47:09.060 --> 00:47:11.750
to participate.

00:47:11.750 --> 00:47:13.950
So those are thoughts I
would leave with you.

00:47:13.950 --> 00:47:18.180
And thank you for the great
opportunity and the question.

00:47:18.180 --> 00:47:20.110
AUDIENCE: If you could talk
about the disaster relief work

00:47:20.110 --> 00:47:22.610
that you do, and especially
how do you find those

00:47:22.610 --> 00:47:24.770
grassroots organizations in
places that you've never

00:47:24.770 --> 00:47:26.970
worked in before and to do it
quickly so that it actually

00:47:26.970 --> 00:47:27.190
has an impact?

00:47:27.190 --> 00:47:27.910
RUTH MESSINGER: It's
a perfect question.

00:47:27.910 --> 00:47:30.310
We actually don't.

00:47:30.310 --> 00:47:34.430
We will increasingly going
forward, strategically as a

00:47:34.430 --> 00:47:38.660
lesson we've learned over the
last 15 years, we will target

00:47:38.660 --> 00:47:39.910
our disaster--

00:47:42.030 --> 00:47:45.830
our visibility after a disaster
will be targeted to

00:47:45.830 --> 00:47:48.500
the extent that it's a country
in which we already work.

00:47:48.500 --> 00:47:51.670
That doesn't mean we'll refuse,
because disasters

00:47:51.670 --> 00:47:55.860
because of media and because
of sad stories and drama,

00:47:55.860 --> 00:47:58.750
disasters are one of the few
issues that get covered in the

00:47:58.750 --> 00:47:59.440
American press.

00:47:59.440 --> 00:48:02.420
And so it's one of the times for
us to capture new donors.

00:48:02.420 --> 00:48:04.775
So God forbid if there was a
disaster tomorrow in a country

00:48:04.775 --> 00:48:07.780
in which we've never worked, we
would put ourselves on the

00:48:07.780 --> 00:48:10.280
Google lists, on "The New
York Times" list.

00:48:10.280 --> 00:48:13.700
But we would also strategize
within 36 hours, because

00:48:13.700 --> 00:48:16.130
that's about the window that we
have, as to, OK, if we get

00:48:16.130 --> 00:48:18.460
a lot of money for this
disaster, exactly what are we

00:48:18.460 --> 00:48:20.470
going to do, because it's
not a country in

00:48:20.470 --> 00:48:21.660
which we've done work?

00:48:21.660 --> 00:48:24.580
And the most likely answer is we
partner with some people or

00:48:24.580 --> 00:48:29.320
we tell people, if you want to
feed people tomorrow, actually

00:48:29.320 --> 00:48:30.590
don't send the money to us.

00:48:30.590 --> 00:48:33.260
Because it's going to take us
two months to figure out.

00:48:33.260 --> 00:48:34.200
That's on the first hand.

00:48:34.200 --> 00:48:37.290
On the other hand, countries
where we have worked, where we

00:48:37.290 --> 00:48:40.350
know grassroots groups, I'm
just going to say right up

00:48:40.350 --> 00:48:42.780
front, we are infinitely better
placed to do your

00:48:42.780 --> 00:48:46.300
relief money, because the money
will actually get to the

00:48:46.300 --> 00:48:48.500
people in need almost
immediately.

00:48:48.500 --> 00:48:51.860
And it won't all be spent at
once, because in Haiti the

00:48:51.860 --> 00:48:56.570
story is not just what did
people need right away.

00:48:56.570 --> 00:49:00.050
Haiti's a country that fed its
entire population on its own,

00:49:00.050 --> 00:49:02.300
off of its own land
50 years ago.

00:49:02.300 --> 00:49:06.640
And it's now totally dependent
on expensive imports.

00:49:06.640 --> 00:49:09.190
And the big danger after
something like the earthquake

00:49:09.190 --> 00:49:12.290
is that it will only
make that worse.

00:49:12.290 --> 00:49:15.900
The more food aid we bring in,
the lower the options for

00:49:15.900 --> 00:49:16.900
Haitian farmers.

00:49:16.900 --> 00:49:18.820
And so we're really
pretty smart.

00:49:18.820 --> 00:49:22.200
We received $6.5 million
after the earthquake.

00:49:22.200 --> 00:49:25.720
And we didn't tell every $10
donor, but we told every

00:49:25.720 --> 00:49:30.080
decent sized donor, this is a
five year plan for investment

00:49:30.080 --> 00:49:33.710
in protecting women and
girls and agricultural

00:49:33.710 --> 00:49:35.470
sustainability in Haiti.

00:49:35.470 --> 00:49:37.300
And if you want to spend it
tomorrow, give it to someone

00:49:37.300 --> 00:49:38.940
else, but it won't
be as useful.

00:49:38.940 --> 00:49:44.190
We had eight project partner
organizations in Haiti at the

00:49:44.190 --> 00:49:47.870
time of the earthquake, two that
we had funded previously.

00:49:47.870 --> 00:49:51.930
We now have 41, because they
lead us to others.

00:49:51.930 --> 00:49:55.760
[APPLAUSE]

00:49:55.760 --> 00:49:58.190
RUTH MESSINGER: Oh, I forgot
to say first of all that we

00:49:58.190 --> 00:50:01.980
advertise our trips on our
website, which is ajws.org.

00:50:01.980 --> 00:50:05.530
And second of all, despite my
evident advanced age, I want

00:50:05.530 --> 00:50:06.780
you all to know that I tweet.
