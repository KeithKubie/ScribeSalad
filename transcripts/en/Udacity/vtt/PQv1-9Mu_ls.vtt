00:00:00.360 --> 00:00:03.050
In this question, we're going to ask you to make

00:00:03.050 --> 00:00:05.580
a persona. Now, doing this can be one of

00:00:05.580 --> 00:00:09.370
the most difficult and intimidating thing that a designer

00:00:09.370 --> 00:00:13.260
has to do, but it's really useful. So to try

00:00:13.260 --> 00:00:15.760
and keep this very first persona as sort of

00:00:15.760 --> 00:00:19.200
simple and straightforward as possible, we're going to ask that you

00:00:19.200 --> 00:00:22.190
make it for yourself. And hopefully these two words

00:00:22.190 --> 00:00:25.460
are throwing up a huge warning for you. Because it

00:00:25.460 --> 00:00:27.470
almost, sounds like we're asking you to go down

00:00:27.470 --> 00:00:31.790
the path of designing for yourself, but we're not. Normally,

00:00:31.790 --> 00:00:33.730
you do not want to design yourself, and you won't

00:00:33.730 --> 00:00:36.910
be doing that here. So why are we asking you

00:00:36.910 --> 00:00:39.190
to do this? For one thing, we hope this

00:00:39.190 --> 00:00:43.290
is an easy introduction to creating a persona, because it

00:00:43.290 --> 00:00:47.150
really can be quite difficult. For another, what we want

00:00:47.150 --> 00:00:50.770
to do is seed the discussion form, with a bunch

00:00:50.770 --> 00:00:55.790
of authentic personas and use cases. In, in the next question you'll take the

00:00:55.790 --> 00:01:01.080
personas and use cases created by classmates for themselves, and

00:01:01.080 --> 00:01:05.470
build feature lists and flows for them. We've create a template in

00:01:05.470 --> 00:01:08.300
Prezzy, and there's a link to it below that might help you out.
