1
00:00:00,010 --> 00:00:05,010
[inaudible].

2
00:00:08,040 --> 00:00:12,070
Boom. Good. Okay. We had
some tough technical problem.
Let's try it again. Okay.

3
00:00:12,090 --> 00:00:15,200
So anyway, brother, welcome. Thanks
for coming here. Thanks. Thanks.

4
00:00:15,201 --> 00:00:18,720
So what we were saying before,
we actually said this already,

5
00:00:18,721 --> 00:00:20,490
but let's say it again because
the people didn't hear it.

6
00:00:20,491 --> 00:00:25,320
You were one of the pioneers of standup
comedy in Brazil. Yeah, yeah. He was a,

7
00:00:25,321 --> 00:00:28,260
I started with like four or five guys.

8
00:00:28,650 --> 00:00:33,510
We started doing it like 16,
17 years ago and uh,

9
00:00:33,630 --> 00:00:35,010
nobody knew about standup.

10
00:00:35,220 --> 00:00:38,280
It was something that I found out when
I came here to live and play basketball.

11
00:00:38,430 --> 00:00:42,570
I had a scholarship to play
basketball and I watched Jim Gaffigan.

12
00:00:42,900 --> 00:00:46,530
Oh Wow. And Brian Regan.
Ah, I know those guys.

13
00:00:46,531 --> 00:00:51,330
And I thought it was so weird
because those guys were like, that's,

14
00:00:51,420 --> 00:00:55,740
I was questioning his, his,
his, does he call his name?

15
00:00:55,741 --> 00:00:56,491
Brian Regan does.

16
00:00:56,491 --> 00:01:01,491
He is actually him because we used
to have characters and impersonators,

17
00:01:02,580 --> 00:01:05,280
so we was kind of weird.
But at the same time,

18
00:01:05,281 --> 00:01:09,210
it was interesting because I'm not
a guy who does characters and I do

19
00:01:09,211 --> 00:01:12,560
observations and I ride,
I was a journalist, I'm a
heavy degree in journalism.

20
00:01:12,570 --> 00:01:16,110
So he was interesting for me to see
those guys doing comedy and I thought we

21
00:01:16,111 --> 00:01:17,580
could do the same in my country.

22
00:01:17,610 --> 00:01:21,450
It's so crazy that it took that
long for it to get to Brazil. Yeah.

23
00:01:21,570 --> 00:01:23,550
You would think that because
everything else, I mean,

24
00:01:23,551 --> 00:01:28,320
you guys have movies and you know, uh, I
mean city of God, you have action movies,

25
00:01:28,321 --> 00:01:30,870
you have all these,
you have so much that's so similar.

26
00:01:30,871 --> 00:01:34,310
The fact that standup comedy made
it there is so unusual to see a,

27
00:01:34,320 --> 00:01:37,590
I took a long time a, it
was, I don't know why,

28
00:01:37,591 --> 00:01:42,450
but the image off a comedian speaking
like with a blazer or a suit or something

29
00:01:42,451 --> 00:01:47,100
was Jerry Seinfeld, very American.
You know, and those jokes,

30
00:01:47,101 --> 00:01:51,120
do they actually connect them much with
us? Like, Oh, I have those buckets.

31
00:01:51,121 --> 00:01:55,290
And it was something that we
have bigger problems than, oh,

32
00:01:55,291 --> 00:01:58,880
I just have a pocket. Or when am I
gonna put my pan? I was like, he was,

33
00:01:58,930 --> 00:02:03,300
he was something that I could, we
couldn't connect them much, but when we,

34
00:02:03,420 --> 00:02:07,440
when we saw there was a lot of people
doing other stuff and there was like this

35
00:02:07,441 --> 00:02:12,330
huge role that we could actually explore
that was when it become interesting for

36
00:02:12,331 --> 00:02:15,750
us. So comedy in Brazil, there
would basically be like a,

37
00:02:15,780 --> 00:02:19,200
like say if I was a Brazilian community
and I would come up with a fake name,

38
00:02:19,250 --> 00:02:24,090
if you will, and I would do a character,
a wig, a wig. I'll wear a certain outfit,

39
00:02:24,120 --> 00:02:28,710
outfit like a very over
the top screaming and uh,

40
00:02:29,460 --> 00:02:32,910
and that's teal still exists in Brazil.

41
00:02:32,940 --> 00:02:36,240
This is like a popular part
of the people stand up.

42
00:02:36,270 --> 00:02:40,650
I'm not saying that it's for everyone.
Now I have my Netflix bash show.

43
00:02:40,651 --> 00:02:43,740
We B is becoming huge because,
uh,

44
00:02:43,741 --> 00:02:47,550
we have some other options right now
with the Internet. Everything changed.

45
00:02:47,551 --> 00:02:50,280
The game changed
completely. So we have, uh,

46
00:02:50,310 --> 00:02:53,430
what is good has his own space right now.

47
00:02:53,431 --> 00:02:56,160
It's not only was the TV
ones shoot to watch it.

48
00:02:56,161 --> 00:03:00,670
So the game changed a little for,
for all of, so how did you start out?

49
00:03:00,671 --> 00:03:05,020
Did you start out by going
to music clubs or, he was,

50
00:03:05,080 --> 00:03:10,080
I actually studying the a BDSM
club sadomasochists clubs.

51
00:03:13,090 --> 00:03:18,090
I remember that there was like pictures
Cox in the band and in like a giant as a

52
00:03:19,181 --> 00:03:23,920
huge vaginas and their habit,
and we had that show any you was,

53
00:03:24,370 --> 00:03:25,480
it wasn't good,

54
00:03:25,840 --> 00:03:30,700
but it was an experience for all
of us to go on stage and try to,

55
00:03:30,760 --> 00:03:32,580
to,
to show them a,

56
00:03:32,690 --> 00:03:37,480
our opinions and our jokes and
some irony and sarcasm and we wish,

57
00:03:37,481 --> 00:03:42,130
which was something that people wasn't
watching, eh. But then he becomes,

58
00:03:42,160 --> 00:03:47,050
he becomes something huge and we got
chances to go to TV and everything else.

59
00:03:47,051 --> 00:03:50,950
But at first it was difficult because
people could not understand is he a

60
00:03:50,951 --> 00:03:53,200
character?
Is he playing a part?

61
00:03:53,850 --> 00:03:56,060
So that's why I had an ice tea.

62
00:03:56,061 --> 00:04:00,910
We'll have a lot of problems with the
law because like I did a rape joke,

63
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:05,140
which I'm not proud of. I'm saying
it's not something like, oh,

64
00:04:05,440 --> 00:04:10,240
I'm so over the top, I love it in the
line. And, but uh, he was like, does,

65
00:04:10,480 --> 00:04:14,710
does this guy wants people to be raped
at what is, what is he thinking? What is,

66
00:04:15,310 --> 00:04:19,090
because with all those jokes was taken
out of context and put it on newspapers

67
00:04:19,300 --> 00:04:24,280
kind of killed, uh, you kind of killed my
desire to the comedy over that as well.

68
00:04:24,370 --> 00:04:28,690
Really? Yeah, it was, it was difficult
man, because he was like journalists,

69
00:04:29,230 --> 00:04:34,230
journalists in the audience waiting
for me to say some shit booed out of

70
00:04:35,501 --> 00:04:36,334
context.

71
00:04:36,370 --> 00:04:40,810
And then the guy at like fucking like
billions of clicks on their websites

72
00:04:40,830 --> 00:04:43,720
because of core joke. I
did. Yeah. That's how we,

73
00:04:43,721 --> 00:04:45,910
the controversy was starting over that.

74
00:04:45,911 --> 00:04:47,260
And I don't know if it's
the same thing here.

75
00:04:47,440 --> 00:04:50,520
So they knew that this was a new thing.
They,

76
00:04:50,720 --> 00:04:52,600
and so they would come to see it.

77
00:04:52,601 --> 00:04:57,310
And then what were they criticizing
it before this? He was, he was huge.

78
00:04:57,311 --> 00:05:01,050
Everybody loved today first.
But when, when, when, when,

79
00:05:01,710 --> 00:05:06,710
when we started to have money
and a TV shows and we kind of,

80
00:05:07,310 --> 00:05:12,280
uh, ran away out of the underground,
I was doing shows at midnight,

81
00:05:12,340 --> 00:05:16,900
like packing at three, 300 CT
at there, at midnight in Brazil.

82
00:05:17,140 --> 00:05:21,010
That was my thing. I underground in
some fall in the middle of nowhere.

83
00:05:21,610 --> 00:05:24,610
But then people have this guy's talented.
Let me give him a chance.

84
00:05:24,611 --> 00:05:29,440
So they put me on TV and out of nowhere
I was on TV doing the same thing.

85
00:05:29,740 --> 00:05:31,130
Wow. So the, the,

86
00:05:31,450 --> 00:05:35,440
the country was not that prepared
for what I was doing at the time.

87
00:05:35,500 --> 00:05:39,120
What kind of laws do you have in Brazil
in terms of like the language that

88
00:05:39,121 --> 00:05:42,430
you're allowed to use on
television? Uh, you know, the,

89
00:05:43,090 --> 00:05:47,830
I'm not saying there's like a government
censorship about what you can say,

90
00:05:47,840 --> 00:05:52,720
what you cannot say, but uh, sponsors and,

91
00:05:52,960 --> 00:05:57,960
and even TV stations and the media is
very sensitive about everything because

92
00:05:58,850 --> 00:06:02,000
it's to a poor country. It's still a
Brazil, still a third world country.

93
00:06:02,390 --> 00:06:07,270
So we are, we are like, we have a lot of
people that don't understand the though,

94
00:06:07,340 --> 00:06:09,530
oh this is comedy. What, what's comedy?

95
00:06:09,531 --> 00:06:13,710
So it was my duty to
explain a little bit why.

96
00:06:13,730 --> 00:06:18,680
Well we're stand up and kind of
for open a road for all of us.

97
00:06:18,681 --> 00:06:22,120
That's how I felt.
So you and you said three other new ways,

98
00:06:22,121 --> 00:06:24,560
like three or four guys.
So who are these other guys?

99
00:06:24,850 --> 00:06:28,160
They're still doing comedy in Brazil.
Yeah. They still doing this to heal.

100
00:06:28,190 --> 00:06:32,270
What are their names? Uh,
Marcello Mansfield than illusion.

101
00:06:32,271 --> 00:06:34,370
Chili or kind of feel you.

102
00:06:34,550 --> 00:06:38,260
There was a small group of guys that
we started doing Brazilian Portuguese.

103
00:06:38,261 --> 00:06:42,080
It's such a beautiful language. I
love it. I love it. It's like a song.

104
00:06:42,081 --> 00:06:46,730
It's like it's [inaudible] I'm
doing Jujitsu for 23 years.

105
00:06:46,731 --> 00:06:50,810
So it's like, to me that sound is like,
it's such a cool sound. What does,

106
00:06:50,840 --> 00:06:52,240
what does Brazilians say in,

107
00:06:52,241 --> 00:06:55,310
in Jersey says those that awards are
something that they are still repeating

108
00:06:55,340 --> 00:06:58,260
that you know? Well, I mean,
you know Paul Hall, Paul,

109
00:06:59,810 --> 00:07:03,260
which is com. Yeah. Is that
fucker com which went to come.

110
00:07:03,410 --> 00:07:08,010
But sometimes we'll come ah, pull
though. Sometimes you say it like damn,

111
00:07:08,360 --> 00:07:11,120
but it's come, it's called
Com. But so that's funny.

112
00:07:11,121 --> 00:07:14,630
Cause like that's like the word Shit.
Like shit could be like,

113
00:07:14,660 --> 00:07:19,200
you could look at something,
go chef medic. That's good
input to this. Mad At. Okay.

114
00:07:19,420 --> 00:07:23,540
But shit can also be bad.
Yeah. You know, like fuck too.

115
00:07:23,570 --> 00:07:26,590
Like fuck could be good or fuck could
be bad. Like you could stub your tongue,

116
00:07:26,600 --> 00:07:30,620
go fuck. Or You could, you could see
a girl with a beautiful body and go,

117
00:07:30,650 --> 00:07:34,550
fuck yeah. But Paul is the
same thing. It's so crazy.

118
00:07:34,570 --> 00:07:39,280
But it's called boom.
Got Big ba Ba.

119
00:07:40,040 --> 00:07:44,630
But anyway, you're getting a
choke for her. Yeah, I got it.

120
00:07:44,631 --> 00:07:46,070
I got is the same.
Exactly.
