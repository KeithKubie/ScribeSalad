00:00:01.240 --> 00:00:06.290
The answer is 1,927 amino acids. Now if

00:00:06.290 --> 00:00:07.870
you had any trouble coming up with this, it's

00:00:07.870 --> 00:00:10.050
probably because you need to go back and really

00:00:10.050 --> 00:00:13.750
focus on what gets translated by a ribosome. We

00:00:13.750 --> 00:00:16.170
know that between the start and stop codons, the

00:00:16.170 --> 00:00:18.990
ribosome starts reading at the start codon and stops

00:00:18.990 --> 00:00:22.280
reading at the stop codon. And for this sequence

00:00:22.280 --> 00:00:26.770
we have 5,784 nucleotides. So if we actually divide

00:00:26.770 --> 00:00:28.410
three right, which is the number of

00:00:28.410 --> 00:00:31.130
nucleotides in a codon. Right, the section that

00:00:31.130 --> 00:00:33.280
a ribosome reads, and divide that into the

00:00:33.280 --> 00:00:39.710
total number of nucleotides we get 1,928. But

00:00:39.710 --> 00:00:46.990
why did we not get 27? Remember that 1928 includes the stop codon, but the stop

00:00:46.990 --> 00:00:49.860
codon doesn't have an amino acid associated with

00:00:49.860 --> 00:00:51.830
it. The start codon does, right? It has

00:00:51.830 --> 00:00:57.030
methionine or MET met, or M. But the stop doesn't have any amino acid

00:00:57.030 --> 00:01:02.470
associated with it. So we'd get 1928 when we divide 5784 by 3.

00:01:02.470 --> 00:01:07.460
But then we need to subtract one, because the last codon isn't turned into an

00:01:07.460 --> 00:01:12.860
amino acid. And so then we're left with 1927 amino acids.
