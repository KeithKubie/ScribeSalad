00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.479
Oh my goodness

00:00:01.479 --> 00:00:02.500
Wow

00:00:02.500 --> 00:00:07.950
I got a homemade bag of thermite a map gas torch and a can of soda .mn .n.because today we're doing science

00:00:08.109 --> 00:00:10.379
So here's the basic idea behind this experiment today

00:00:10.380 --> 00:00:13.139
We've got thermite and we've got cans of Soda

00:00:13.139 --> 00:00:16.829
Now cans of soda Soda are actually pressurized vessels and the more you shake them the more the pressure

00:00:16.900 --> 00:00:19.949
builds the soda can itself is a pressurized container made of

00:00:20.050 --> 00:00:24.390
Aluminum very thin aluminum and filled with a liquid that's infused with Carbon dioxide gas

00:00:24.550 --> 00:00:29.699
The more you Shake it the more pressure rises and the warmer the soda the harder it is for carbon dioxide to stay in solution

00:00:29.980 --> 00:00:31.840
The melting point of aluminum is around

00:00:31.840 --> 00:00:36.509
1,200 degrees Fahrenheit and with thin aluminum like this it can be melted down pretty quickly now on the other hand

00:00:36.579 --> 00:00:39.359
Thermite burns at four to five times that temperature

00:00:39.360 --> 00:00:45.270
So it should easily cut right through our can so what is most likely to happen when the two materials meet is the can going?

00:00:45.270 --> 00:00:48.869
To explode well the soda shoot like a guys are high up into the air will the whole thing melt

00:00:49.030 --> 00:00:51.030
That is what we're about to find out

00:00:51.100 --> 00:00:55.860
If you take any standard soda can and flip it over you're going to see some kind of a concave shape on the bottom

00:00:55.860 --> 00:00:58.709
We're going to use this as a dish to pile up a little mound of thermite

00:00:58.710 --> 00:01:03.989
so when we touch it off all that hot molten iron will flow down to the bottom eat through the aluminum and go straight into

00:01:03.989 --> 00:01:07.588
The soda so we're going to do a series of three different experiments here. We're going to start with one

00:01:07.590 --> 00:01:13.290
Can that hasn't been shaken at all a second can that has been shaken very vigorously and a third can where we've opened the soda

00:01:13.290 --> 00:01:18.599
And allowed it to go completely flat let's get started with cat number one unshaken turned upside down and ready to be lit off

00:01:22.990 --> 00:01:24.990
and on the pan

00:01:28.620 --> 00:01:30.620
Nice little pile right there

00:01:32.940 --> 00:01:35.630
So our Canada said it's got a nice little amount of thermite on the top

00:01:35.630 --> 00:01:38.809
So we're going to do now is take a sparkler and light the tip touch it off and run away

00:01:44.460 --> 00:01:46.460
Here we go

00:01:49.080 --> 00:01:50.610
Wow

00:01:50.610 --> 00:01:52.610
That's really broken come check this out

00:01:52.680 --> 00:01:56.900
What I noticed just happened is the thermite made a very clean cut out of the bottom here went down in the soda

00:01:57.210 --> 00:02:00.349
Obviously burn some of the bottom here because it's float or did it

00:02:01.320 --> 00:02:03.739
if we look underneath here the can hot

00:02:04.740 --> 00:02:06.740
Not too bad

00:02:07.200 --> 00:02:09.950
Looking down at the top of the can you can see there's a hole there in the top

00:02:10.289 --> 00:02:14.839
Where the thermite came out and leaked soda all around there's a little bit of the tab that got melted off

00:02:15.450 --> 00:02:18.500
Just cuts cut clean in half and we've got a nice little

00:02:19.020 --> 00:02:22.789
Bit of slag or something built right up here, so that's a pretty cool reaction

00:02:22.790 --> 00:02:28.310
It wasn't nearly as dangerous as I was expecting nice little spark a nice little flare the thermite you could see melted the hole

00:02:28.310 --> 00:02:32.630
Right through the bottom and drop straight down to the soda. Which is very cool, but it wasn't very dangerous

00:02:32.630 --> 00:02:37.130
I mean the spray radius wasn't very big so let's go ahead and shake up a count soda and see if that has any effect

00:02:37.320 --> 00:02:39.320
once the thermite cut through

00:02:40.800 --> 00:02:42.800
Just do a little bit less first-time

00:02:45.239 --> 00:02:47.239
Sparkler

00:02:52.570 --> 00:02:56.040
That was cool interesting so that was a little bit different guys. It actually happened

00:02:56.040 --> 00:02:57.630
so fast my Sparkler still going

00:02:57.630 --> 00:03:03.210
But check this out when that pops through you can see a jet of soda shot up into the air the thermite didn't make it

00:03:03.210 --> 00:03:07.469
Through this time because I put about half as much so it actually like coagulated on the top here

00:03:07.470 --> 00:03:10.470
And I I can actually hear something sizzling and bubbling inside

00:03:10.470 --> 00:03:14.580
It sounds like there's still quite a bit of soda in that can if I'm to touch it

00:03:15.130 --> 00:03:19.799
It's not too terribly hot it's warm actually it is really warm in a top down

00:03:19.800 --> 00:03:21.780
Here's not so bad though, and it's still full of soda

00:03:21.780 --> 00:03:26.220
So if I turn that over you can actually see that fill out now if I set this down in the soda

00:03:27.100 --> 00:03:30.269
Nothing. I was hoping to hear it fizz or pop or something that nature

00:03:30.820 --> 00:03:34.139
So interesting so we've got a little bit of damage there. You can see that

00:03:34.780 --> 00:03:37.649
Thermite has solidified or maybe that was the aluminum

00:03:37.650 --> 00:03:40.530
I think that's part of the aluminum can actually bubbled up the top

00:03:40.990 --> 00:03:44.399
Because you can see it's actually part of the can we blistered the aluminum on the can

00:03:44.590 --> 00:03:48.750
This is probably where the thermite went in we saw that little yet, so this next cam

00:03:48.750 --> 00:03:50.970
Let's do the same thing again, but let's add more thermite

00:03:50.970 --> 00:03:53.699
So it actually does get down inside and see if that's a little more explosive reaction

00:03:58.090 --> 00:04:02.910
Alright, it's lit a little bit more firm out here, whoa?

00:04:05.680 --> 00:04:06.880
oh-ho

00:04:06.880 --> 00:04:09.239
Wow, okay, wow, okay?

00:04:09.910 --> 00:04:14.669
Okay, okay. We got to talk about this because that was a little bit dangerous look at my glove here

00:04:14.670 --> 00:04:17.070
You see that hole in my glove, okay?

00:04:17.070 --> 00:04:21.089
When that exploded it sent showers of Sparks of thermite that landed in my hair

00:04:21.090 --> 00:04:24.959
And I can now smell burning human hair which is my hair which is a risk

00:04:24.960 --> 00:04:27.630
I was totally prepared to take for you today, but that was a little bit dangerous

00:04:27.630 --> 00:04:33.359
you can see what happened is once the thermite actually got inside the can it erupted and it took all that Molten thermite on the

00:04:33.360 --> 00:04:36.780
Top and sprayed it out into the air some of which landed on me

00:04:37.240 --> 00:04:41.820
Thermite is not the kind of stuff if you wanna have stuck to you, so hopefully we got it off

00:04:41.820 --> 00:04:46.200
I'm sure you can see little burn marks on my lab coat and if we look around for damage

00:04:46.200 --> 00:04:48.569
I definitely thought that land in my hair I

00:04:49.120 --> 00:04:51.419
Smelled a little bit of burning, but I think I got it out quick enough

00:04:51.419 --> 00:04:55.649
So I think we're good look at how the bottom of the aluminum. Can here is bubbled back up

00:04:55.650 --> 00:04:59.729
It's even hard to see where the thermite went in I mean. There's not really any noticeable hole there

00:04:59.800 --> 00:05:03.150
We turned upside down though there are two points of impact

00:05:03.610 --> 00:05:07.829
It was almost like a cat launching Molten thermite in my general Direction

00:05:08.769 --> 00:05:12.119
For this next experiment. We're going to grab a new can pop the top and shake it around

00:05:12.119 --> 00:05:15.869
So it loses its fizz and see what thermite does when it goes into an unpressurized can

00:05:21.219 --> 00:05:23.219
That's really warm

00:05:25.909 --> 00:05:28.479
Since this is an open hole. I think we can go a little bit bigger

00:05:30.500 --> 00:05:33.459
Whoa? Oh my goodness. Oh my goodness

00:05:34.400 --> 00:05:36.400
apparently thermite reacts with soda

00:05:36.979 --> 00:05:38.419
interesting I

00:05:38.419 --> 00:05:40.419
Wasn't really expecting that

00:05:40.460 --> 00:05:43.269
Just for fun. We have to open up a new can and see if it does the same thing

00:05:46.219 --> 00:05:48.219
busy

00:05:48.830 --> 00:05:50.949
Just to put a little bit of thermite down in there

00:05:52.669 --> 00:05:54.669
Wow, that's quite a reaction that

00:05:55.310 --> 00:05:57.310
was just a little bit ah

00:05:58.039 --> 00:06:01.689
I wonder a thermite and root beer is the next two mentos and coke

00:06:01.690 --> 00:06:05.859
I think what I'm going to do is just try and light one and see if it spills over to light the other

00:06:12.229 --> 00:06:14.229
Wow

00:06:15.530 --> 00:06:17.530
very cool

00:06:18.050 --> 00:06:24.909
Now what's still going? It's actually burning the can and you can actually see the soda boiling

00:06:27.199 --> 00:06:32.049
That was interesting actually like melted off the whole top of the can like the aluminum itself was burning

00:06:32.050 --> 00:06:34.779
I think it was I think the aluminum itself was brewing this

00:06:35.029 --> 00:06:35.960
jumped over

00:06:35.960 --> 00:06:41.829
Burned off the top of the can and then the soda itself was actually bubbling there for a little while while the Molten iron cooled

00:06:41.830 --> 00:06:42.830
down

00:06:42.830 --> 00:06:45.460
Wow, look at how red this soda turns out

00:06:47.479 --> 00:06:49.479
Looking how red that is

00:06:49.789 --> 00:06:51.740
That is not natural

00:06:51.740 --> 00:06:52.839
Wow, okay?

00:06:52.839 --> 00:06:57.189
So a couple of interesting things that we just learned here apparently if you add thermite to root beer

00:06:57.259 --> 00:06:58.639
It has the same kind of crazy

00:06:58.639 --> 00:07:03.369
Reaction that mentos and coke do in fact it might even be a little bit more vigorous that might be something we try to feature

00:07:03.440 --> 00:07:08.799
Project the other thing it was really interesting to me is the top of the can itself actually started to burn the aluminum

00:07:08.800 --> 00:07:14.169
Just wasn't melting it was actually burning until it dropped down into the liquid and fizzled out now

00:07:14.169 --> 00:07:17.978
We have six cans of root beer left. So for one final experiment for one grand finale

00:07:17.979 --> 00:07:22.479
I say we stack them up in a pyramid and cover the whole thing with thermite watch them all go off at once

00:07:25.660 --> 00:07:27.869
Maybe someday Joe building go home

00:07:37.030 --> 00:07:39.419
I'm going to use all the rest of my thermite on this as well

00:07:42.280 --> 00:07:43.840
ha ha

00:07:43.840 --> 00:07:45.010
Here we are

00:07:45.010 --> 00:07:48.780
The pyramid of thermite doom and the question is if I light at the top here

00:07:48.960 --> 00:07:53.310
Will it make enough of a shower of sparks to ignite the rest of it? We've got thermite around the base

00:07:53.310 --> 00:08:00.449
We've got thermite at every level. We've even got dust coating of thermite on the cans themselves, so grand finale Epic finish here we go

00:08:01.090 --> 00:08:03.239
Alright time for Big Bertha. Let's light it up

00:08:06.790 --> 00:08:10.740
Beautiful whoa? Oh my goodness

00:08:12.430 --> 00:08:14.579
ha ha ha ho oh

00:08:15.430 --> 00:08:19.019
My goodness look at this look at this. It's still spraying out under high pressure there

00:08:19.690 --> 00:08:23.489
Look at this it's shooting out like 6 feet these little bits are shooting out

00:08:23.490 --> 00:08:27.660
This is extremely hot right now if I were to get my glove much closer would start melting

00:08:28.870 --> 00:08:30.520
Wow, wow wow?

00:08:30.520 --> 00:08:33.809
That looked insane it started with the top and just as I was hoping that Molten

00:08:33.940 --> 00:08:38.580
Waterfall spilled over the edges igniting all the thermite at one and when I was a little bit concerned about it

00:08:38.580 --> 00:08:40.770
I actually saw the whole thing explode. I saw Molten metal

00:08:40.770 --> 00:08:45.059
Go flying through the air a little bit concerned about you mark my camera guy because you right in the line of fire

00:08:45.280 --> 00:08:49.980
I'm glad to see you're okay and look at this. This is amazing. We've got bulges on the side of the can here

00:08:49.980 --> 00:08:55.829
We've got a little pinhole leaks. We've got these things sizzling. This can is split in half. Oh, wow look at that

00:08:56.170 --> 00:09:00.119
How did that happen how how did that happen that's amazing?

00:09:38.280 --> 00:09:40.280
This one's still spewing soda

00:09:40.710 --> 00:09:43.430
is actually still pretty full for the most part if I shake it and

00:09:44.400 --> 00:09:46.550
The you can't set it back down because it will fall over

00:09:48.270 --> 00:09:52.069
There's just a tiny little hole on the side here everything else is mostly intact. Oh

00:09:52.650 --> 00:09:59.780
Wow, the pull tab is gone this one is full in fact. It's still pressurized to look at look at the way

00:09:59.780 --> 00:10:02.540
It's bulged up here the bottom has involved is all whoa

00:10:03.270 --> 00:10:04.830
Did you see that?

00:10:04.830 --> 00:10:08.240
Did you see that? It's just off that thing is ready to go?

00:10:09.810 --> 00:10:13.160
I'm going to kind of open that very gingerly

00:10:15.240 --> 00:10:17.509
There we go like a hot one

00:10:18.210 --> 00:10:21.439
How's it taste? Yeah? Is this still good can we still drink it?

00:10:22.320 --> 00:10:23.940
Hmm. Oh

00:10:23.940 --> 00:10:28.400
Man, it's warm. It's really warm. I guess that's one way to get a little iron in your diet

00:10:29.730 --> 00:10:32.569
All right guys. Let's take just a second to talk about what just happened there

00:10:32.630 --> 00:10:36.439
So we started out this experiment mainly just to see how thermite would react with soda

00:10:36.480 --> 00:10:42.680
We tried a series of three different experiments the first one was just a regular soda can when the thermite actually hit that it burned?

00:10:42.680 --> 00:10:46.519
The top off completely and fell into the can it was cool that the entire top burned off

00:10:46.520 --> 00:10:48.330
But what was even more amazing was that the thermite?

00:10:48.330 --> 00:10:53.780
Trickled down to the bottom and burned holes in the bottom of the can as well allowing all the soda to escape the second experiment

00:10:53.780 --> 00:10:58.670
Was with a can that we shook up violently and used half as much thermite what we found was that the thermite burned a small?

00:10:58.670 --> 00:11:01.249
hole into the top of the can releasing a geyser of soda and

00:11:01.350 --> 00:11:06.949
Splashing thermite off to the side so we took another can of soda shook it even harder and loaded up with twice as much thermite

00:11:06.950 --> 00:11:12.499
and that one exploded with a bang so much molten thermite got thrown up into the air that actually came down and landed in my

00:11:12.500 --> 00:11:15.590
Hair which is not an experience. I can recommend trying yourself

00:11:15.590 --> 00:11:20.449
we opened up the next can of soda and sprinkle a thermite around the top where a little bit leaked in and we found the

00:11:20.450 --> 00:11:24.770
Geyser reaction that happens between coke and mentos very interesting and when we lit it off

00:11:24.770 --> 00:11:30.170
The top of the can actually burned it didn't just melt the aluminum. It actually burned for our last experiment

00:11:30.170 --> 00:11:34.729
We used the last six cans to build a pyramid we covered the whole thing in thermite and lit it off to see what would

00:11:34.730 --> 00:11:35.930
Happen and happen

00:11:35.930 --> 00:11:41.449
It did the whole thing exploded viewing Molten metal up into the sky and raining down all over my camera guy mark

00:11:41.640 --> 00:11:45.319
So what really happens when thermite meets soda well it depends on the condition

00:11:45.320 --> 00:11:51.909
We're dealing with a lot of factors here from temperatures pressures boiling liquids dissolved gases and burning metals. Which is epik

00:11:51.910 --> 00:11:56.830
So there we have a guys another day of epic experimenting nobody got seriously hurt, and we get to live to tell another story

00:11:57.170 --> 00:12:00.250
Thanks for joining it for this video. I'll be looking for here the next one Doc you then?

00:12:01.279 --> 00:12:03.279
You okay mark? Yeah?

00:12:04.370 --> 00:12:05.990
nope
