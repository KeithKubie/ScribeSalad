00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.792
Near Alta Badia in the Italian Dolomites

00:00:02.792 --> 00:00:05.959
a legacy of horrendous violence has left behind

00:00:05.959 --> 00:00:07.250
a kind of gift.

00:00:07.250 --> 00:00:09.500
It’s a museum in the mountains.

00:00:14.792 --> 00:00:17.041
I’m very much not a mountain climber.

00:00:17.041 --> 00:00:19.874
But when I visited Alta Badia in 2014,

00:00:19.875 --> 00:00:22.083
I got to pretend for the day.

00:00:22.083 --> 00:00:25.417
I was able to look up at this towering spire of rock

00:00:25.417 --> 00:00:27.250
and I said to myself, “You know what,

00:00:27.250 --> 00:00:29.834
I just Dolomite climb that mountain."

00:00:29.834 --> 00:00:32.709
By clipping a carabiner to a metal cable

00:00:32.709 --> 00:00:35.625
and pulling myself up a series of iron rungs

00:00:35.625 --> 00:00:37.542
I was able to climb a mountain that I would

00:00:37.542 --> 00:00:39.417
never normally have been able to.

00:00:39.417 --> 00:00:41.375
And it was really amazing.

00:00:41.375 --> 00:00:44.959
But these beautiful vistas were once the site of massive violence,

00:00:44.959 --> 00:00:48.583
made possible by these iron rungs and cables I was climbing.

00:00:48.583 --> 00:00:51.166
This system was known as the Via Ferrata

00:00:51.166 --> 00:00:52.959
or “The Iron Road."

00:00:55.917 --> 00:01:00.166
Italy declared war on the Austro-Hungarian Empire in May 1915

00:01:00.166 --> 00:01:03.166
and soldiers rushed up both sides of the mountains.

00:01:03.166 --> 00:01:07.208
They began fighting at the top of these snowy, icy impasses

00:01:07.208 --> 00:01:09.458
and this became known as the Dolomite Front

00:01:09.458 --> 00:01:10.834
or “The White War."

00:01:10.834 --> 00:01:15.125
These soldiers fought at altitudes of up to 12,000 feet,

00:01:15.125 --> 00:01:19.291
and in weather as cold as -22 degrees Fahrenheit.

00:01:19.291 --> 00:01:23.208
Digging in for a long fight, the Austrians built an entire ice city

00:01:23.208 --> 00:01:24.333
on the side of the mountain.

00:01:24.333 --> 00:01:27.917
They had store rooms and barracks and everything was connected

00:01:27.917 --> 00:01:29.166
by ice tunnels.

00:01:29.166 --> 00:01:33.750
And both sides built incredibly elaborate systems of cabling  and iron rungs

00:01:33.750 --> 00:01:36.750
to bring both soldiers and supplies up and down the mountain.

00:01:36.750 --> 00:01:39.792
It was this system, these Via Ferrata or iron roads,

00:01:39.792 --> 00:01:43.333
that made this insane fight even possible.

00:01:43.333 --> 00:01:45.875
Both the Italians and the Austrians tunneled.

00:01:45.875 --> 00:01:49.917
And the idea was to tunnel as close beneath an enemy bunker,

00:01:49.917 --> 00:01:51.792
pack them with explosives

00:01:51.792 --> 00:01:54.875
and then blow the opposing force off the mountain.

00:01:54.875 --> 00:01:59.083
In early 1916 the Italians decided to strike a decisive blow at the Austrians

00:01:59.083 --> 00:02:01.041
and they spent 3 months digging a tunnel

00:02:01.041 --> 00:02:04.208
that would come just 12 feet below the Austrian bunker.

00:02:04.208 --> 00:02:07.458
Now the Austrians could hear them digging for weeks

00:02:07.458 --> 00:02:09.625
but were told to hold position.

00:02:09.625 --> 00:02:13.083
On April 14th, the noise stopped

00:02:13.083 --> 00:02:16.959
and 100 men were instantaneously vaporized,

00:02:16.959 --> 00:02:20.709
as were 90 feet off the top of the mountain.

00:02:20.709 --> 00:02:23.625
By the time the Dolomite Front was abandoned in 1917,

00:02:23.625 --> 00:02:26.417
150,000 men had died on the mountains,

00:02:26.417 --> 00:02:29.083
mostly of cold and exposure.

00:02:29.083 --> 00:02:32.083
Today the remains of this war are ever present.

00:02:32.083 --> 00:02:34.625
You can visit the bunkers and tunnels

00:02:34.625 --> 00:02:36.709
carved by these soldiers

00:02:36.709 --> 00:02:40.083
and climb the same Via Ferrata routes that they climbed

00:02:40.083 --> 00:02:41.792
to bring supplies up and down.

00:02:41.792 --> 00:02:46.041
In the last few decades, over 80 soldiers have been recovered

00:02:46.041 --> 00:02:48.917
as the ice has thawed and released their bodies.

00:02:48.917 --> 00:02:51.083
I climbed Pisciadu, which is a newer route

00:02:51.083 --> 00:02:54.166
but there are over 400 Via Ferrata’s in the area.

00:02:54.166 --> 00:02:57.834
It’s a chance both to look at the incredible natural beauty

00:02:57.834 --> 00:03:00.625
and mourn those lost on the mountainside.

00:03:03.917 --> 00:03:05.792
For me personally it was a real victory

00:03:05.792 --> 00:03:08.125
to climb up that mountain through the Via Ferrata.

00:03:08.125 --> 00:03:11.709
I’d always thought of myself as more of a sedimentary type

00:03:12.792 --> 00:03:14.250
Geology jokes.
