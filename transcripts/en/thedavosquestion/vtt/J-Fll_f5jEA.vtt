00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.020
&gt;&gt; Yeah, in terms of the question will China
us pull out of the

00:00:07.020 --> 00:00:18.000
economy's critical crisis -- I don't think
China can take too much

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:25.340
heavy responsibility at this time.
China, in past three decades, even China has

00:00:25.340 --> 00:00:31.160
already achieved very
great accomplishment in economic growth but

00:00:31.160 --> 00:00:45.510
mostly depends too heavy on
low, low-end or cheap labor in terms of business.

00:00:45.510 --> 00:00:52.820
So I think China also need more time to enhance
or increase its

00:00:52.820 --> 00:01:00.280
capability in knowledge-base industry and
also increase R&amp;D capability.

00:01:00.280 --> 00:01:07.149
So, but anyhow, China is also a very huge
market, consumer market, so I

00:01:07.149 --> 00:01:13.819
think definitely China will keep the world
 -- more contribute in

00:01:13.819 --> 00:01:23.709
economy, advice, huge consumer market.
But also China needs some time to increase

00:01:23.709 --> 00:01:29.299
or enhance this
knowledge-intensive capability is my point.
