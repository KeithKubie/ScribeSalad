00:00:00.480 --> 00:00:03.290
So this lesson we're going to
go through an exercise.

00:00:03.290 --> 00:00:07.030
Imagine you had to prepare an analysis
model of the external behavior of this

00:00:07.030 --> 00:00:09.620
clock radio using state charts.

00:00:09.620 --> 00:00:12.140
What steps would you take to do this?

00:00:12.140 --> 00:00:14.690
Because we are concerned
here with modeling behavior,

00:00:14.690 --> 00:00:19.830
one natural way to get started is with
usage scenarios, also called use cases.

00:00:19.830 --> 00:00:21.530
A use case is a sequence of steps,

00:00:21.530 --> 00:00:25.510
each involving an actor performing
an action, possibly on an object.

00:00:25.510 --> 00:00:28.850
Clearly any model of behavior of the
clock radio must indicate how each of

00:00:28.850 --> 00:00:31.080
the use cases is realized.

00:00:31.080 --> 00:00:34.730
See if you can come up with three
typical use cases for the clock radio.

00:00:34.730 --> 00:00:38.260
&gt;&gt; Okay.
So the first use case I can think of

00:00:38.260 --> 00:00:42.700
is that the user is setting the time for
one of the three different modes.

00:00:42.700 --> 00:00:47.770
Whether that's the display time or
the time we want the alarm to go off.

00:00:48.820 --> 00:00:52.190
There's a third time but with each of
those, I guess there's a separate use

00:00:52.190 --> 00:00:55.920
case but we'll just say setting
the time is use case one.

00:00:55.920 --> 00:00:59.080
&gt;&gt; Okay, so, Jared is right

00:00:59.080 --> 00:01:02.210
that each one of those would be a
separate use case and now we're picking

00:01:02.210 --> 00:01:06.300
the one about just setting the time
of day that's visible on the display.

00:01:06.300 --> 00:01:10.610
&gt;&gt; And then for use case number
two we could change the frequency

00:01:10.610 --> 00:01:14.790
of the radio so we may be in AM mode and
changing the frequency,

00:01:14.790 --> 00:01:18.520
or in FM mode and
changing the frequency.

00:01:18.520 --> 00:01:22.270
&gt;&gt; So regardless of the mode, we're
changing what station is coming in.

00:01:22.270 --> 00:01:25.350
&gt;&gt; Right, so we're going to be
twisting that knob to change it.

00:01:25.350 --> 00:01:26.010
&gt;&gt; On the side.

00:01:26.010 --> 00:01:26.620
&gt;&gt; On the side.

00:01:26.620 --> 00:01:27.290
Okay.

00:01:27.290 --> 00:01:32.950
And then for a third use case, let's
say the user presses the snooze button,

00:01:32.950 --> 00:01:36.360
the alarm's going off and
they want to sleep a little bit longer.

00:01:36.360 --> 00:01:38.040
&gt;&gt; Okay.
Clearly there are lots of other ones,

00:01:38.040 --> 00:01:41.460
like just listening to the radio,
turning it on and just listening to it,

00:01:41.460 --> 00:01:45.449
or getting shocked out of
bed by the beeper going off.

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:50.930
Lots of possibilities here and
ultimately, our state and

00:01:50.930 --> 00:01:56.170
chart model needs to be able to cover
all the cases that might arise,

00:01:56.170 --> 00:02:02.130
including error cases,
including situations where what you had

00:02:02.130 --> 00:02:07.600
hoped to happen doesn't happen and the
radio has to respond in that situation.
