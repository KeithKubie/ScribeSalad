evaluation metric is like placing a

00:00:04.610 --> 00:00:04.620
evaluation metric is like placing a
 

00:00:04.620 --> 00:00:06.889
evaluation metric is like placing a
target somewhere for your team to aim at

00:00:06.889 --> 00:00:06.899

but sometimes partway through a project

00:00:08.750 --> 00:00:08.760
but sometimes partway through a project
 

00:00:08.760 --> 00:00:11.060
but sometimes partway through a project
you might realize you put your target in

00:00:11.060 --> 00:00:11.070
you might realize you put your target in
 

00:00:11.070 --> 00:00:12.919
you might realize you put your target in
the wrong place in that case you should

00:00:12.919 --> 00:00:12.929
the wrong place in that case you should
 

00:00:12.929 --> 00:00:15.230
the wrong place in that case you should
move your target let's take a look at an

00:00:15.230 --> 00:00:15.240
move your target let's take a look at an
 

00:00:15.240 --> 00:00:17.840
move your target let's take a look at an
example let's say you built a CAD

00:00:17.840 --> 00:00:17.850

Avram's a and B have respectively three

00:00:30.080 --> 00:00:30.090
Avram's a and B have respectively three
 

00:00:30.090 --> 00:00:32.089
Avram's a and B have respectively three
percent error and five percent error so

00:00:32.089 --> 00:00:32.099
percent error and five percent error so
 

00:00:32.099 --> 00:00:34.240
percent error and five percent error so
it seems like Gotham a is doing better

00:00:34.240 --> 00:00:34.250
it seems like Gotham a is doing better
 

00:00:34.250 --> 00:00:36.950
it seems like Gotham a is doing better
but let's say you try out these

00:00:36.950 --> 00:00:36.960
but let's say you try out these
 

00:00:36.960 --> 00:00:38.240
but let's say you try out these
algorithms you look at these algorithms

00:00:38.240 --> 00:00:38.250
algorithms you look at these algorithms
 

00:00:38.250 --> 00:00:40.850
algorithms you look at these algorithms
and album a for some reason is letting

through a lot of pornographic images so

00:00:43.970 --> 00:00:43.980
through a lot of pornographic images so
 

00:00:43.980 --> 00:00:46.940
through a lot of pornographic images so
if you ship algorithm a the users would

00:00:46.940 --> 00:00:46.950
if you ship algorithm a the users would
 

00:00:46.950 --> 00:00:49.069
if you ship algorithm a the users would
see more cat images because you know see

00:00:49.069 --> 00:00:49.079
see more cat images because you know see
 

00:00:49.079 --> 00:00:51.560
see more cat images because you know see
percent error is identifying cats but it

00:00:51.560 --> 00:00:51.570
percent error is identifying cats but it
 

00:00:51.570 --> 00:00:53.900
percent error is identifying cats but it
also shows you users some holographic

00:00:53.900 --> 00:00:53.910
also shows you users some holographic
 

00:00:53.910 --> 00:00:56.299
also shows you users some holographic
images which is totally unacceptable but

00:00:56.299 --> 00:00:56.309

percent error so it lists classifies

00:01:04.130 --> 00:01:04.140
percent error so it lists classifies
 

00:01:04.140 --> 00:01:06.830
percent error so it lists classifies
fewer images but it doesn't have

00:01:06.830 --> 00:01:06.840
fewer images but it doesn't have
 

00:01:06.840 --> 00:01:09.620
fewer images but it doesn't have
pornographic images so from your

00:01:09.620 --> 00:01:09.630
pornographic images so from your
 

00:01:09.630 --> 00:01:11.570

is actually much better algorithm

00:01:15.890 --> 00:01:15.900
is actually much better algorithm
 

00:01:15.900 --> 00:01:17.240
is actually much better algorithm
because you know it's not learning

00:01:17.240 --> 00:01:17.250
because you know it's not learning
 

00:01:17.250 --> 00:01:19.580
because you know it's not learning
through any common graphics images so

00:01:19.580 --> 00:01:19.590
through any common graphics images so
 

00:01:19.590 --> 00:01:21.469
through any common graphics images so
what's happened in this example is that

00:01:21.469 --> 00:01:21.479
what's happened in this example is that
 

00:01:21.479 --> 00:01:24.499
what's happened in this example is that
album a is doing better on the

evaluation metric is giving three

00:01:26.510 --> 00:01:26.520
evaluation metric is giving three
 

00:01:26.520 --> 00:01:28.700
evaluation metric is giving three
percent error but is actually worse

00:01:28.700 --> 00:01:28.710
percent error but is actually worse
 

00:01:28.710 --> 00:01:31.700

algorithm so in this case the evaluation

00:01:31.700 --> 00:01:31.710
algorithm so in this case the evaluation
 

00:01:31.710 --> 00:01:36.800
algorithm so in this case the evaluation
metric plus the DEF set it prefers album

00:01:36.800 --> 00:01:36.810

through Paulo graphics images so when
 

00:01:51.540 --> 00:01:54.440
through Paulo graphics images so when
this happens when your evaluation metric

00:01:54.440 --> 00:01:54.450
this happens when your evaluation metric
 

00:01:54.450 --> 00:01:57.399
this happens when your evaluation metric
is no longer correctly rank ordering

00:01:57.399 --> 00:01:57.409

00:01:59.820 --> 00:02:02.780
preferences between algorithms in this
case is miss predicting that album a is

00:02:02.780 --> 00:02:02.790
case is miss predicting that album a is
 

00:02:02.790 --> 00:02:04.880
case is miss predicting that album a is
a better algorithm then there's a sign

00:02:04.880 --> 00:02:04.890
a better algorithm then there's a sign
 

00:02:04.890 --> 00:02:07.429
a better algorithm then there's a sign
that you should change your evaluation

00:02:07.429 --> 00:02:07.439
that you should change your evaluation
 

00:02:07.439 --> 00:02:10.820
that you should change your evaluation
metric or perhaps you're on development

00:02:10.820 --> 00:02:10.830

up the number of examples on which you
 

00:02:58.549 --> 00:03:01.000
up the number of examples on which you
know this thing in sign is true so this

00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:01.010
know this thing in sign is true so this
 

00:03:01.010 --> 00:03:02.940
know this thing in sign is true so this
formula just counts up the number of

00:03:02.940 --> 00:03:02.950
formula just counts up the number of
 

00:03:02.950 --> 00:03:07.509
formula just counts up the number of
misclassifying examples so the problem

00:03:07.509 --> 00:03:07.519
misclassifying examples so the problem
 

00:03:07.519 --> 00:03:09.370
misclassifying examples so the problem
with this evaluation metric is that they

00:03:09.370 --> 00:03:09.380
with this evaluation metric is that they
 

00:03:09.380 --> 00:03:12.130
with this evaluation metric is that they
trees pornographic and non pornographic

00:03:12.130 --> 00:03:12.140
trees pornographic and non pornographic
 

00:03:12.140 --> 00:03:14.920
trees pornographic and non pornographic
images equally but you really want to

00:03:14.920 --> 00:03:14.930
images equally but you really want to
 

00:03:14.930 --> 00:03:18.130
images equally but you really want to
conspire to not miss label pornographic

00:03:18.130 --> 00:03:18.140
conspire to not miss label pornographic
 

00:03:18.140 --> 00:03:19.660
conspire to not miss label pornographic
images like maybe recognize a

00:03:19.660 --> 00:03:19.670

pornographic images academician

00:03:21.520 --> 00:03:21.530
pornographic images academician
 

00:03:21.530 --> 00:03:24.069
pornographic images academician
therefore show it to a unsuspecting

00:03:24.069 --> 00:03:24.079
therefore show it to a unsuspecting
 

00:03:24.079 --> 00:03:26.199
therefore show it to a unsuspecting
users therefore very unhappy with you

00:03:26.199 --> 00:03:26.209
users therefore very unhappy with you
 

00:03:26.209 --> 00:03:31.770
users therefore very unhappy with you
know unexpectedly seeing porn

00:03:31.770 --> 00:03:31.780
 
 

00:03:31.780 --> 00:03:34.630
 
so one way to change this evaluation

00:03:34.630 --> 00:03:34.640
so one way to change this evaluation
 

00:03:34.640 --> 00:03:37.870
so one way to change this evaluation
metric would be if you had a weight term

00:03:37.870 --> 00:03:37.880
metric would be if you had a weight term
 

00:03:37.880 --> 00:03:43.000
metric would be if you had a weight term
here and we call this WI where WI is

00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:43.010
here and we call this WI where WI is
 

00:03:43.010 --> 00:03:47.610
here and we call this WI where WI is
going to be equal to 1 in front X I is

00:03:47.610 --> 00:03:47.620
going to be equal to 1 in front X I is
 

00:03:47.620 --> 00:03:54.220
going to be equal to 1 in front X I is
non porn and maybe 10 or maybe even

00:03:54.220 --> 00:03:54.230
non porn and maybe 10 or maybe even
 

00:03:54.230 --> 00:04:01.410
non porn and maybe 10 or maybe even
larger number like 100 if X I is porn

00:04:01.410 --> 00:04:01.420
larger number like 100 if X I is porn
 

00:04:01.420 --> 00:04:04.059
larger number like 100 if X I is porn
so this way you're giving a much larger

00:04:04.059 --> 00:04:04.069
so this way you're giving a much larger
 

00:04:04.069 --> 00:04:07.120
so this way you're giving a much larger
weight to examples that are pornographic

00:04:07.120 --> 00:04:07.130
weight to examples that are pornographic
 

00:04:07.130 --> 00:04:09.699
weight to examples that are pornographic
so that the error term goes up much more

00:04:09.699 --> 00:04:09.709
so that the error term goes up much more
 

00:04:09.709 --> 00:04:12.490
so that the error term goes up much more
on the algorithm this makes mistakes on

think you should take a machine learning

00:06:02.800 --> 00:06:02.810
think you should take a machine learning
 

00:06:02.810 --> 00:06:05.170
think you should take a machine learning
problem and break it into distinct steps

00:06:05.170 --> 00:06:05.180
problem and break it into distinct steps
 

00:06:05.180 --> 00:06:07.870
problem and break it into distinct steps
so one knob or one step is to figure out

00:06:07.870 --> 00:06:07.880
so one knob or one step is to figure out
 

00:06:07.880 --> 00:06:11.920
so one knob or one step is to figure out
how to define a metric they captures

00:06:11.920 --> 00:06:11.930
how to define a metric they captures
 

00:06:11.930 --> 00:06:17.020
how to define a metric they captures
what you want to do and I will

00:06:17.020 --> 00:06:17.030
what you want to do and I will
 

00:06:17.030 --> 00:06:19.270
what you want to do and I will
is separately about how to actually do

00:06:19.270 --> 00:06:19.280
is separately about how to actually do
 

00:06:19.280 --> 00:06:23.110
is separately about how to actually do
well on this metric so I think of the

00:06:23.110 --> 00:06:23.120
well on this metric so I think of the
 

00:06:23.120 --> 00:06:25.720
well on this metric so I think of the
machine learning tasks as two distinct

00:06:25.720 --> 00:06:25.730
machine learning tasks as two distinct
 

00:06:25.730 --> 00:06:28.480
machine learning tasks as two distinct
steps to use the target analogy the

00:06:28.480 --> 00:06:28.490
steps to use the target analogy the
 

00:06:28.490 --> 00:06:34.270
steps to use the target analogy the
first step is to place the target so

00:06:34.270 --> 00:06:34.280
first step is to place the target so
 

00:06:34.280 --> 00:06:36.070
first step is to place the target so
define where you want to aim and then

00:06:36.070 --> 00:06:36.080
define where you want to aim and then
 

00:06:36.080 --> 00:06:38.170
define where you want to aim and then
it's a completely separate step so this

00:06:38.170 --> 00:06:38.180
it's a completely separate step so this
 

00:06:38.180 --> 00:06:40.060
it's a completely separate step so this
is one knife you could tune which is how

00:06:40.060 --> 00:06:40.070
is one knife you could tune which is how
 

00:06:40.070 --> 00:06:41.770
is one knife you could tune which is how
do you place the target and it's

00:06:41.770 --> 00:06:41.780
do you place the target and it's
 

00:06:41.780 --> 00:06:44.410
do you place the target and it's
completely separate problem think of it

00:06:44.410 --> 00:06:44.420
completely separate problem think of it
 

00:06:44.420 --> 00:06:47.200
completely separate problem think of it
as a separate knob to tune in terms of

00:06:47.200 --> 00:06:47.210
as a separate knob to tune in terms of
 

00:06:47.210 --> 00:06:49.960
as a separate knob to tune in terms of
how to do well at a target or how to you

00:06:49.960 --> 00:06:49.970
how to do well at a target or how to you
 

00:06:49.970 --> 00:06:55.810
how to do well at a target or how to you
know aim accurately or how to shoot at

00:06:55.810 --> 00:06:55.820
know aim accurately or how to shoot at
 

00:06:55.820 --> 00:07:02.080
know aim accurately or how to shoot at
the target and so defining a metric is

00:07:02.080 --> 00:07:02.090
the target and so defining a metric is
 

00:07:02.090 --> 00:07:04.750
the target and so defining a metric is
step one and you do something else for

00:07:04.750 --> 00:07:04.760
step one and you do something else for
 

00:07:04.760 --> 00:07:07.480
step one and you do something else for
step two so in terms of shooting the

00:07:07.480 --> 00:07:07.490
step two so in terms of shooting the
 

00:07:07.490 --> 00:07:09.490
step two so in terms of shooting the
target maybe your learning algorithm is

00:07:09.490 --> 00:07:09.500

00:07:09.500 --> 00:07:11.710

optimizing some cost function that looks
 

00:07:11.720 --> 00:07:13.290
optimizing some cost function that looks
like this

00:07:13.290 --> 00:07:13.300
like this
 

00:07:13.300 --> 00:07:16.380
like this
are you minimizing this you know some

00:07:16.380 --> 00:07:16.390
are you minimizing this you know some
 

00:07:16.390 --> 00:07:23.500
are you minimizing this you know some
losses on your training set so one thing

00:07:23.500 --> 00:07:23.510
losses on your training set so one thing
 

00:07:23.510 --> 00:07:26.590
losses on your training set so one thing
you could do is to also modify this in

00:07:26.590 --> 00:07:26.600
you could do is to also modify this in
 

00:07:26.600 --> 00:07:28.240
you could do is to also modify this in
order to incorporate these weights and

00:07:28.240 --> 00:07:28.250
order to incorporate these weights and
 

00:07:28.250 --> 00:07:29.260
order to incorporate these weights and
maybe you end up changing this

00:07:29.260 --> 00:07:29.270
maybe you end up changing this
 

00:07:29.270 --> 00:07:32.050
maybe you end up changing this
normalization constant as well suggest

00:07:32.050 --> 00:07:32.060
normalization constant as well suggest
 

00:07:32.060 --> 00:07:35.200

of how you define J is important but the
 

00:07:37.220 --> 00:07:38.860
of how you define J is important but the
point was with the philosophy for

formalization think of placing the

00:07:41.200 --> 00:07:41.210
formalization think of placing the
 

00:07:41.210 --> 00:07:43.360
formalization think of placing the
target that's one step and aiming and

00:07:43.360 --> 00:07:43.370
target that's one step and aiming and
 

00:07:43.370 --> 00:07:45.310

which you do separately so so in other

00:07:48.730 --> 00:07:48.740
which you do separately so so in other
 

00:07:48.740 --> 00:07:49.810
which you do separately so so in other
words I encourage you to think of

00:07:49.810 --> 00:07:49.820
words I encourage you to think of
 

00:07:49.820 --> 00:07:51.850
words I encourage you to think of
defining the metrics as one step and

00:07:51.850 --> 00:07:51.860
defining the metrics as one step and
 

00:07:51.860 --> 00:07:54.250
defining the metrics as one step and
then you can and only after you've

then you can and only after you've
 

00:07:54.260 --> 00:07:56.050
then you can and only after you've
defined in metric figure out how to do

00:07:56.050 --> 00:07:56.060
defined in metric figure out how to do
 

00:07:56.060 --> 00:07:57.550
