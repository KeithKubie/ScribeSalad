[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:00:05.925 --> 00:00:07.050
SARAH STEIN LUBRANO: Hello.

00:00:07.050 --> 00:00:08.430
Thank you for coming.

00:00:08.430 --> 00:00:10.470
It's a pleasure being
here for all of us.

00:00:10.470 --> 00:00:13.550
Today, I'm going to talk
really briefly, but hopefully

00:00:13.550 --> 00:00:16.070
usefully, about what we do
and give you a taste of it

00:00:16.070 --> 00:00:18.350
as well in our philosophical
meditation, which is one

00:00:18.350 --> 00:00:20.159
of our most loved exercises.

00:00:20.159 --> 00:00:22.700
So, first, we'll talk about what
we do at The School of Life.

00:00:22.700 --> 00:00:24.908
Then we'll talk about what
emotional intelligence is,

00:00:24.908 --> 00:00:26.630
how we see it at
The School of Life.

00:00:26.630 --> 00:00:28.880
We'll talk about why it's
so important at work.

00:00:28.880 --> 00:00:30.770
And, also, we'll talk about
how we at The School of life

00:00:30.770 --> 00:00:33.353
teach emotional intelligence in
our classes, in our workshops,

00:00:33.353 --> 00:00:36.025
in our events, and sort
of our technique there.

00:00:36.025 --> 00:00:37.650
And, finally, you'll
get to try it out.

00:00:37.650 --> 00:00:39.566
So you'll have a sense
of how it works for you

00:00:39.566 --> 00:00:42.290
or how one of our exercises
works for you in any case.

00:00:42.290 --> 00:00:44.150
So to start, let me
tell you a little bit

00:00:44.150 --> 00:00:46.820
about what we do at
The School of Life.

00:00:46.820 --> 00:00:49.790
We are a global organization
dedicated to developing

00:00:49.790 --> 00:00:51.390
emotional intelligence.

00:00:51.390 --> 00:00:53.330
And we have 10 locations
around the world,

00:00:53.330 --> 00:00:55.430
but we operate in even
more countries than that.

00:00:55.430 --> 00:00:58.250
We have, first of all,
concrete classrooms

00:00:58.250 --> 00:01:01.010
where people can go and
take workshops and classes

00:01:01.010 --> 00:01:03.740
on particular emotional
topics, as was mentioned.

00:01:03.740 --> 00:01:06.740
So we teach things like how to
make love last, and the meaning

00:01:06.740 --> 00:01:08.720
of life, and how
to fail, or things

00:01:08.720 --> 00:01:11.234
about how to be calm,
how to cope with anxiety.

00:01:11.234 --> 00:01:12.650
We're teaching the
types of skills

00:01:12.650 --> 00:01:14.450
that you might wish that
you had learned in school,

00:01:14.450 --> 00:01:15.732
but generally aren't covered.

00:01:15.732 --> 00:01:17.690
And, in particular, we're
trying to save people

00:01:17.690 --> 00:01:19.400
a little bit of time and grief.

00:01:19.400 --> 00:01:20.750
Because these are things
that, otherwise, we

00:01:20.750 --> 00:01:23.060
tend to learn sometimes
through really hard experience.

00:01:23.060 --> 00:01:24.601
So we'd like to save
you a little bit

00:01:24.601 --> 00:01:26.780
of that pain and a little
bit of that time learning

00:01:26.780 --> 00:01:29.450
by doing some thinking upfront.

00:01:29.450 --> 00:01:31.640
You can see here some of
the things that we do.

00:01:31.640 --> 00:01:33.560
That's our classroom in
London in Bloomsbury.

00:01:33.560 --> 00:01:35.120
And you can always come by.

00:01:35.120 --> 00:01:38.480
We've also got a store
front in most of our places

00:01:38.480 --> 00:01:41.052
where you can purchase some
of our books and products.

00:01:41.052 --> 00:01:42.260
Sometimes we have big events.

00:01:42.260 --> 00:01:44.954
And those are really interesting
on different emotional topics.

00:01:44.954 --> 00:01:47.120
And, finally, we've got
locations in lots of places.

00:01:47.120 --> 00:01:50.360
So that's a little map of
where our locations are.

00:01:50.360 --> 00:01:53.597
In particular, we tend to focus
our work on two areas of life.

00:01:53.597 --> 00:01:55.430
And this guy says it
even better than we do.

00:01:55.430 --> 00:01:57.055
This is Sigmund Freud.

00:01:57.055 --> 00:01:59.430
We're very fond of Freud and
of psychotherapy in general.

00:01:59.430 --> 00:02:01.555
We really believe that it's
beneficial for everyone

00:02:01.555 --> 00:02:02.930
at some point in their life.

00:02:02.930 --> 00:02:05.750
Freud said of his patients,
"love, and work, work and love.

00:02:05.750 --> 00:02:07.200
That's all there is."

00:02:07.200 --> 00:02:08.990
And by that, he meant
that, on the whole,

00:02:08.990 --> 00:02:11.569
that was where people
came to him to talk about.

00:02:11.569 --> 00:02:13.610
That was the area in their
life where they really

00:02:13.610 --> 00:02:14.750
needed to explore.

00:02:14.750 --> 00:02:16.850
And we find it's the same
at The School of Life.

00:02:16.850 --> 00:02:17.960
People come, and
they want to talk

00:02:17.960 --> 00:02:19.910
about how to build
fulfilling relationships

00:02:19.910 --> 00:02:22.460
and how to make it work
fulfilling as well.

00:02:22.460 --> 00:02:23.960
So over the last 10 years--

00:02:23.960 --> 00:02:25.340
because we were found in 2008.

00:02:25.340 --> 00:02:26.900
We're just hitting
our second decade.

00:02:26.900 --> 00:02:28.220
Over the last 10
years, we've been

00:02:28.220 --> 00:02:30.761
learning a lot about what people
are concerned about at work,

00:02:30.761 --> 00:02:32.880
what tends to trouble
them, what tends to help,

00:02:32.880 --> 00:02:34.800
what tends to make
work go really well.

00:02:34.800 --> 00:02:36.860
And after a while, people
started coming to us

00:02:36.860 --> 00:02:38.630
and saying, you know
that amazing thing

00:02:38.630 --> 00:02:40.088
that you taught me
about listening,

00:02:40.088 --> 00:02:42.350
or about empathy,
or about patience,

00:02:42.350 --> 00:02:43.760
or about keeping calm?

00:02:43.760 --> 00:02:45.607
I'd really love to
bring it to my office.

00:02:45.607 --> 00:02:46.940
I'd love to bring it to my team.

00:02:46.940 --> 00:02:49.430
Can you come in and teach
our team that thing?

00:02:49.430 --> 00:02:52.500
Or can we do an exercise with my
whole organization about this,

00:02:52.500 --> 00:02:53.150
perhaps?

00:02:53.150 --> 00:02:55.780
So we began to sort of develop
our thinking around what people

00:02:55.780 --> 00:02:56.780
needed in the workplace.

00:02:56.780 --> 00:02:59.030
And we began to provide
services to businesses

00:02:59.030 --> 00:02:59.911
and organizations.

00:02:59.911 --> 00:03:01.910
And, eventually, we decided
that, roughly, there

00:03:01.910 --> 00:03:04.190
were about 20 things
that people really

00:03:04.190 --> 00:03:07.010
needed to know in order to
do well at work in terms

00:03:07.010 --> 00:03:08.540
of emotional intelligence.

00:03:08.540 --> 00:03:09.425
These are the ones.

00:03:09.425 --> 00:03:11.550
And you can see there are
lots of different things,

00:03:11.550 --> 00:03:14.690
so things like adaptability,
diplomacy, playfulness,

00:03:14.690 --> 00:03:17.270
self-awareness,
resilience, right?

00:03:17.270 --> 00:03:19.040
This is more or less
the types of things

00:03:19.040 --> 00:03:22.832
that people need to know in
order to do well at work.

00:03:22.832 --> 00:03:25.040
So we've kind of become
experts in this a little bit,

00:03:25.040 --> 00:03:26.062
hopefully.

00:03:26.062 --> 00:03:27.270
We also do some other things.

00:03:27.270 --> 00:03:28.370
These are some other
things that we do.

00:03:28.370 --> 00:03:30.828
We've got a conference that
travels about every six months.

00:03:30.828 --> 00:03:32.740
We've got a new
location for that.

00:03:32.740 --> 00:03:35.450
We've got really interesting
fun games, cards, books.

00:03:35.450 --> 00:03:37.467
You can see them upstairs
as was mentioned.

00:03:37.467 --> 00:03:39.300
And, of course, we have
our YouTube channel,

00:03:39.300 --> 00:03:42.620
which has about 3.7
million subscribers today.

00:03:42.620 --> 00:03:44.280
And you should become
one if you like.

00:03:44.280 --> 00:03:45.950
And we put out about
two videos a week

00:03:45.950 --> 00:03:48.170
on different topics in
emotional intelligence.

00:03:48.170 --> 00:03:50.880
So we like to bring our message
in lots of different ways

00:03:50.880 --> 00:03:53.810
and connect with people in
lots of different ways as well.

00:03:53.810 --> 00:03:55.490
But I'd like to talk
a little bit now

00:03:55.490 --> 00:03:56.630
about what it is
that we're doing

00:03:56.630 --> 00:03:58.500
with all of these different
ways of talking to people.

00:03:58.500 --> 00:03:59.610
What are we talking about?

00:03:59.610 --> 00:04:03.720
What, in other words, is
emotional intelligence?

00:04:03.720 --> 00:04:07.010
This is the really nice formal
definition that we tend to use.

00:04:07.010 --> 00:04:08.780
Emotional intelligence
is the quality

00:04:08.780 --> 00:04:11.480
that enables us to confront
with patience, insight,

00:04:11.480 --> 00:04:13.520
and imagination
the many problems

00:04:13.520 --> 00:04:15.320
that we face in our
affective relationship

00:04:15.320 --> 00:04:16.829
with ourselves and others.

00:04:16.829 --> 00:04:18.230
And in this case,
effective means

00:04:18.230 --> 00:04:19.612
having to do with emotions.

00:04:19.612 --> 00:04:21.320
So another way I like
to think about this

00:04:21.320 --> 00:04:23.819
is that we're talking to people
about how to navigate around

00:04:23.819 --> 00:04:26.614
their own emotions more
gracefully, more thoughtfully

00:04:26.614 --> 00:04:29.030
and, also, to connect with
other people and other people's

00:04:29.030 --> 00:04:30.988
emotions in a way that's
more intelligent, more

00:04:30.988 --> 00:04:35.270
insightful, and ultimately more
likely to make things go well.

00:04:35.270 --> 00:04:37.250
Now, I know that this
might sound a little bit

00:04:37.250 --> 00:04:38.630
weird to some people.

00:04:38.630 --> 00:04:40.130
Some people say
that's just strange.

00:04:40.130 --> 00:04:42.920
You know, it's like a little
bit of woo-woo magic, whatever.

00:04:42.920 --> 00:04:44.420
Maybe this is just a fad.

00:04:44.420 --> 00:04:46.670
But, actually, we really
think that this is something

00:04:46.670 --> 00:04:48.902
that everyone understands
a little bit intuitively.

00:04:48.902 --> 00:04:50.360
Because we can talk
about people we

00:04:50.360 --> 00:04:52.760
know who have maybe been
very successful at things

00:04:52.760 --> 00:04:54.670
like science, or
even maybe they've

00:04:54.670 --> 00:04:56.420
gotten quite wealthy
in a particular area,

00:04:56.420 --> 00:04:58.503
or they've been a really
good lawyer or something,

00:04:58.503 --> 00:05:01.054
but their personal lives might
be a bit sad or a bit lonely.

00:05:01.054 --> 00:05:03.470
They might have screwed up a
major thing with their family

00:05:03.470 --> 00:05:05.120
or with a relationship.

00:05:05.120 --> 00:05:08.350
Or maybe they're just very
unimaginative or a little bit

00:05:08.350 --> 00:05:11.110
demanding or cruel in a way
that's not very helpful to them

00:05:11.110 --> 00:05:12.040
in the long run.

00:05:12.040 --> 00:05:14.123
And when this is the case,
when someone is clearly

00:05:14.123 --> 00:05:15.790
very intelligent in
one area, but isn't

00:05:15.790 --> 00:05:18.430
very good at navigating their
own emotions or relationships,

00:05:18.430 --> 00:05:20.080
that person can be
said to be lacking

00:05:20.080 --> 00:05:21.490
in emotional intelligence.

00:05:21.490 --> 00:05:23.424
So we all have something
of an intuitive sense

00:05:23.424 --> 00:05:25.590
of what it might mean to
have emotional intelligence

00:05:25.590 --> 00:05:28.960
and, unfortunately,
sometimes to lack it.

00:05:28.960 --> 00:05:30.460
But I want to talk
a little bit more

00:05:30.460 --> 00:05:32.230
about what it is
concretely that you learn

00:05:32.230 --> 00:05:33.980
to do when you have
emotional intelligence

00:05:33.980 --> 00:05:34.979
and when you develop it.

00:05:34.979 --> 00:05:37.210
What exactly are you learning?

00:05:37.210 --> 00:05:40.240
First of all, a major part
of emotional intelligence

00:05:40.240 --> 00:05:42.174
is some skepticism
around our own emotions.

00:05:42.174 --> 00:05:44.590
In other words, that we're not
going to believe everything

00:05:44.590 --> 00:05:45.779
that we feel right away.

00:05:45.779 --> 00:05:47.320
We might feel afraid,
but we're going

00:05:47.320 --> 00:05:49.486
to be able to have a little
bit of distance and ask,

00:05:49.486 --> 00:05:50.770
should I be afraid, right?

00:05:50.770 --> 00:05:52.642
Or, you know, someone
can come to us.

00:05:52.642 --> 00:05:54.100
And we can have a
bit of skepticism

00:05:54.100 --> 00:05:55.040
about their emotions.

00:05:55.040 --> 00:05:56.157
They might be very angry.

00:05:56.157 --> 00:05:58.240
And we're able to have a
little skepticism to say,

00:05:58.240 --> 00:06:00.400
are they just an obnoxious
person that's always angry?

00:06:00.400 --> 00:06:02.608
Or are they really anxious
about something right now,

00:06:02.608 --> 00:06:04.139
and this is covering that over?

00:06:04.139 --> 00:06:05.680
So we think it's
very important to be

00:06:05.680 --> 00:06:08.807
able to have a little bit of
healthy skepticism about why

00:06:08.807 --> 00:06:10.390
we're having the
emotions we're having

00:06:10.390 --> 00:06:13.220
and why other people are having
the emotions they're having.

00:06:13.220 --> 00:06:14.970
And we know this is a
bit countercultural.

00:06:14.970 --> 00:06:17.170
There are a lot of voices in the
world that say, you know, trust

00:06:17.170 --> 00:06:17.794
your instincts.

00:06:17.794 --> 00:06:19.090
Go with your gut instincts.

00:06:19.090 --> 00:06:20.996
But at The School
of Life, we say,

00:06:20.996 --> 00:06:22.120
don't trust your instincts.

00:06:22.120 --> 00:06:23.840
They're often rubbish, right?

00:06:23.840 --> 00:06:26.080
Not always, but it's
good to be able to be

00:06:26.080 --> 00:06:26.980
skeptical about them.

00:06:26.980 --> 00:06:28.510
They can lead us
very far astray.

00:06:28.510 --> 00:06:31.000
And, probably, all of us have
seen that in our own lives

00:06:31.000 --> 00:06:33.880
or in the lives of
someone that we know.

00:06:33.880 --> 00:06:36.500
The other thing that we're very
interested in which is related

00:06:36.500 --> 00:06:38.140
and which we talk a lot
about at The School of life

00:06:38.140 --> 00:06:39.790
is that we talk
a lot about being

00:06:39.790 --> 00:06:42.160
aware of the way our
past might be affecting

00:06:42.160 --> 00:06:44.064
our current emotional responses.

00:06:44.064 --> 00:06:45.980
So we say that emotional
intelligence involves

00:06:45.980 --> 00:06:48.190
recognition of the
importance of our past

00:06:48.190 --> 00:06:49.810
and our childhood in particular.

00:06:49.810 --> 00:06:51.730
You might recognize this if
you've ever been to therapy

00:06:51.730 --> 00:06:53.920
or even read about therapy,
because therapists believe this

00:06:53.920 --> 00:06:54.635
as well.

00:06:54.635 --> 00:06:57.260
And, in particular, they believe
that between the ages of about

00:06:57.260 --> 00:06:59.860
zero and six, a lot of
our emotional apparatus,

00:06:59.860 --> 00:07:01.997
emotional hardware if
you like, is formed.

00:07:01.997 --> 00:07:03.580
It doesn't mean we
can never change it

00:07:03.580 --> 00:07:05.080
after the age of six, of course.

00:07:05.080 --> 00:07:06.640
But it's much, much
harder in the same way

00:07:06.640 --> 00:07:08.620
that it's much, much harder
for someone to learn a language

00:07:08.620 --> 00:07:10.570
once they're over
the age of 20 or so.

00:07:10.570 --> 00:07:12.690
Our minds are shaped a
lot by our childhood.

00:07:12.690 --> 00:07:14.440
And they're also shaped
a lot by our past.

00:07:14.440 --> 00:07:16.930
If we had a very difficult
experience or even a very good

00:07:16.930 --> 00:07:20.040
one, that's likely to affect
how we see things in the future.

00:07:20.040 --> 00:07:22.555
And while this isn't ideal
for a lot of reasons,

00:07:22.555 --> 00:07:25.180
the most important thing is that
we can become conscious of it.

00:07:25.180 --> 00:07:27.130
I also know that some people
will be skeptical about this.

00:07:27.130 --> 00:07:28.838
They'll say, you know,
that's ridiculous.

00:07:28.838 --> 00:07:30.589
I have a really nice
LinkedIn profile now.

00:07:30.589 --> 00:07:32.296
And I look very
professional and serious.

00:07:32.296 --> 00:07:34.240
And I'm an adult. And I
can manage everything,

00:07:34.240 --> 00:07:35.270
thank you very much.

00:07:35.270 --> 00:07:38.120
And I sympathize, because I
sometimes feel that way, too.

00:07:38.120 --> 00:07:40.840
But I think we can see a little
bit of how our childhood might

00:07:40.840 --> 00:07:43.439
have affected us when we get in
high periods of stress, right?

00:07:43.439 --> 00:07:45.730
Or sometimes you can even
see it when people get drunk.

00:07:45.730 --> 00:07:47.170
There are moments where
we kind of revert back

00:07:47.170 --> 00:07:48.010
to our inner child.

00:07:48.010 --> 00:07:49.414
It's a bit like this.

00:07:49.414 --> 00:07:50.080
This is a child.

00:07:50.080 --> 00:07:53.076
And this might be his grown
up version of himself, right?

00:07:53.076 --> 00:07:54.700
You can see this in
people a little bit

00:07:54.700 --> 00:07:56.424
when they're under
a lot of pressure.

00:07:56.424 --> 00:07:58.090
And so the point isn't
that we're always

00:07:58.090 --> 00:07:59.946
going to be acting in
very immature ways,

00:07:59.946 --> 00:08:01.570
but that we have the
potential to do so

00:08:01.570 --> 00:08:02.890
when there's a lot of pressure.

00:08:02.890 --> 00:08:05.530
And, therefore, we need to
become aware a little bit more

00:08:05.530 --> 00:08:07.197
of what those ways
of behaving might be.

00:08:07.197 --> 00:08:09.363
We might have learned as a
child that people are not

00:08:09.363 --> 00:08:11.080
going to be very
responsive to our needs.

00:08:11.080 --> 00:08:12.788
And, actually, it
makes it very difficult

00:08:12.788 --> 00:08:15.500
for us to work in a team
once we're under some stress.

00:08:15.500 --> 00:08:17.470
So there are things
like this about our past

00:08:17.470 --> 00:08:18.928
that emotionally
intelligent people

00:08:18.928 --> 00:08:24.220
tend to become more aware of and
navigate around to some degree.

00:08:24.220 --> 00:08:26.380
I want to talk now more a
little bit about how this

00:08:26.380 --> 00:08:28.210
works in the workplace, right?

00:08:28.210 --> 00:08:32.289
So why is emotional
intelligence important at work?

00:08:32.289 --> 00:08:35.150
Well, one of the reasons
is actually very new.

00:08:35.150 --> 00:08:37.596
This is a new period in human
history in terms of work.

00:08:37.596 --> 00:08:40.179
It's maybe always been helpful
to have emotional intelligence,

00:08:40.179 --> 00:08:41.809
but never more-so than now.

00:08:41.809 --> 00:08:44.895
And it's probably only going
to get more and more important.

00:08:44.895 --> 00:08:47.020
And one of the reasons is
because we're not working

00:08:47.020 --> 00:08:48.499
so much more with our minds.

00:08:48.499 --> 00:08:51.040
For most of human history, we
were gathering nuts and fruits.

00:08:51.040 --> 00:08:52.420
And then suddenly,
we were farming,

00:08:52.420 --> 00:08:53.400
but that was pretty physical.

00:08:53.400 --> 00:08:54.640
And maybe then we
built some pyramids.

00:08:54.640 --> 00:08:56.830
And, you know, we did a
lot of physical labor.

00:08:56.830 --> 00:08:59.350
But after that, only
recently we started

00:08:59.350 --> 00:09:01.210
working in really,
really complicated teams.

00:09:01.210 --> 00:09:02.980
Most people have
started working in ways

00:09:02.980 --> 00:09:05.063
that involve talking to
people and convincing them

00:09:05.063 --> 00:09:07.300
and prioritizing and
managing their own emotions.

00:09:07.300 --> 00:09:09.850
All of the sudden, so much
of our work is psychological.

00:09:09.850 --> 00:09:12.320
And so as a result,
at The School of Life,

00:09:12.320 --> 00:09:14.672
we believe that good business
requires good psychology.

00:09:14.672 --> 00:09:16.630
And that this isn't
something that's, you know,

00:09:16.630 --> 00:09:18.304
cute, and nice,
and good to have,

00:09:18.304 --> 00:09:20.470
and maybe the HR team will
do every once in a while.

00:09:20.470 --> 00:09:22.640
It's something that's
crucial every single day.

00:09:22.640 --> 00:09:23.720
It's not a luxury.

00:09:23.720 --> 00:09:24.590
It's a necessity.

00:09:24.590 --> 00:09:25.870
It's really, really important.

00:09:25.870 --> 00:09:27.591
Because, ultimately
and increasingly,

00:09:27.591 --> 00:09:29.590
it's going to be the very
thing that we work on.

00:09:29.590 --> 00:09:31.300
Even if our technical
skills are great,

00:09:31.300 --> 00:09:33.190
this will determine
whether we succeed

00:09:33.190 --> 00:09:36.160
or don't do so well at the
things that we're working on.

00:09:36.160 --> 00:09:38.650
Again, it's because we used
to be doing things like this.

00:09:38.650 --> 00:09:41.140
And, now all of a sudden,
after thousands and thousands

00:09:41.140 --> 00:09:43.150
of years, a lot of the
most important work

00:09:43.150 --> 00:09:45.730
in the world, a lot of the
work that most of us are doing

00:09:45.730 --> 00:09:46.900
looks more like that.

00:09:46.900 --> 00:09:48.160
And that is very complicated.

00:09:48.160 --> 00:09:51.190
That involves a lot of guessing,
maybe six or seven steps ahead,

00:09:51.190 --> 00:09:54.040
how other people are likely to
respond, how we can persuade

00:09:54.040 --> 00:09:57.040
them, how we can convince them,
how we can get along with them,

00:09:57.040 --> 00:09:59.590
how we can understand
when we're wrong, and why.

00:09:59.590 --> 00:10:01.720
That's very complicated
emotional stuff.

00:10:01.720 --> 00:10:04.630
So, suddenly, our
work is psychological.

00:10:04.630 --> 00:10:06.050
The quality of the
work that we do

00:10:06.050 --> 00:10:09.750
is now hugely dependent on
our emotional states of mind.

00:10:09.750 --> 00:10:12.680
And as a result, we need to
learn with modesty and courage

00:10:12.680 --> 00:10:14.960
and insight how our
emotional minds work

00:10:14.960 --> 00:10:18.040
and why they so
often don't quite.

00:10:18.040 --> 00:10:19.700
And another way of
thinking about this

00:10:19.700 --> 00:10:21.820
is that the most complicated
technologies on Earth

00:10:21.820 --> 00:10:24.320
don't have anything to do with
all the nice things made here

00:10:24.320 --> 00:10:25.190
at Google.

00:10:25.190 --> 00:10:28.230
They are the people in this
room and out there in the world.

00:10:28.230 --> 00:10:29.750
We are the most
complicated things.

00:10:29.750 --> 00:10:32.330
And we need to put ourselves
as much as we can right.

00:10:32.330 --> 00:10:35.460
We need to make
sure it's working.

00:10:35.460 --> 00:10:36.690
So how do we do that?

00:10:36.690 --> 00:10:37.804
That's a good question.

00:10:37.804 --> 00:10:39.470
We'll talk to you a
little bit about how

00:10:39.470 --> 00:10:42.570
we teach emotional intelligence
at The School of Life.

00:10:42.570 --> 00:10:44.570
Some people say, well,
what do you mean teaching

00:10:44.570 --> 00:10:45.410
emotional intelligence?

00:10:45.410 --> 00:10:47.540
Isn't it just something that you
have, or you don't have, right?

00:10:47.540 --> 00:10:49.340
Either you're charming, and
you're good with people,

00:10:49.340 --> 00:10:50.990
and you're good at
communicating, and you're calm,

00:10:50.990 --> 00:10:51.590
or you're not.

00:10:51.590 --> 00:10:52.690
And it's just what
you're born with.

00:10:52.690 --> 00:10:53.480
That's it.

00:10:53.480 --> 00:10:56.059
Why am I trying to
learn this now, right?

00:10:56.059 --> 00:10:58.100
But we completely disagree
at The School of Life.

00:10:58.100 --> 00:11:00.409
We actually think these
are really concrete skills.

00:11:00.409 --> 00:11:01.200
You can learn them.

00:11:01.200 --> 00:11:01.880
You can practice them.

00:11:01.880 --> 00:11:03.588
And you can get better
at them until they

00:11:03.588 --> 00:11:05.330
become second nature in a way.

00:11:05.330 --> 00:11:07.100
We'll talk about nature
more in a second.

00:11:07.100 --> 00:11:08.640
And we're not the only
people who believe

00:11:08.640 --> 00:11:09.680
this in the course of history.

00:11:09.680 --> 00:11:12.221
Here are some funny people who
have definitely believed this.

00:11:12.221 --> 00:11:14.125
These are French
aristocrats in a salon.

00:11:14.125 --> 00:11:15.500
And people like
this were trained

00:11:15.500 --> 00:11:18.770
for a long period of life
to be more charming, better

00:11:18.770 --> 00:11:19.560
communicators.

00:11:19.560 --> 00:11:20.540
They learned some
funny things, like how

00:11:20.540 --> 00:11:22.599
to stand behind a chair
in a charming way, right?

00:11:22.599 --> 00:11:24.890
But they also learned how to
persuade, how to convince,

00:11:24.890 --> 00:11:26.582
how to say no without
giving offense.

00:11:26.582 --> 00:11:28.790
And it's really not so much
about the concrete skills

00:11:28.790 --> 00:11:30.740
that they had, because you
might need different ones now

00:11:30.740 --> 00:11:31.742
that you work here.

00:11:31.742 --> 00:11:33.200
It's the idea that
there are things

00:11:33.200 --> 00:11:35.780
that seem natural, but
really took a lot of practice

00:11:35.780 --> 00:11:37.220
and training to get right.

00:11:37.220 --> 00:11:38.640
There are things that can
make you more likable.

00:11:38.640 --> 00:11:40.973
There are things that can
make you succeed and do better

00:11:40.973 --> 00:11:41.540
in the world.

00:11:41.540 --> 00:11:44.319
So we believe what these
guys believed in a way.

00:11:44.319 --> 00:11:45.860
And we also believe
what, in general,

00:11:45.860 --> 00:11:48.702
is called the classical
approach to education,

00:11:48.702 --> 00:11:51.160
which is in contrast to the
romantic approach to education.

00:11:51.160 --> 00:11:52.580
The romantic
approach to education

00:11:52.580 --> 00:11:54.500
built on the Romantic
Movement in the 1800s

00:11:54.500 --> 00:11:56.375
says, you know, human
nature is wonderful.

00:11:56.375 --> 00:11:57.500
Let's just have more of it.

00:11:57.500 --> 00:11:59.708
All the things that humans
are already good at, let's

00:11:59.708 --> 00:12:01.400
develop them and encourage them.

00:12:01.400 --> 00:12:03.320
But, actually, we're
very interested in what

00:12:03.320 --> 00:12:05.111
you might call second
nature, the thing you

00:12:05.111 --> 00:12:05.960
develop afterward.

00:12:05.960 --> 00:12:07.670
In other words, we're very
interested in the types

00:12:07.670 --> 00:12:09.440
of tools we can use,
almost technologies

00:12:09.440 --> 00:12:11.540
we can use, to improve
or otherwise wouldn't

00:12:11.540 --> 00:12:13.310
be natural for human beings.

00:12:13.310 --> 00:12:14.900
And theorists of
classical education

00:12:14.900 --> 00:12:16.810
love to use the
metaphor of the tool.

00:12:16.810 --> 00:12:18.680
Or in this case,
it's a pulley, right?

00:12:18.680 --> 00:12:21.511
Because no one by nature is
fitted to lift a heavy statue

00:12:21.511 --> 00:12:22.010
like that.

00:12:22.010 --> 00:12:24.010
That's the statue
actually, that guy.

00:12:24.010 --> 00:12:25.850
But with the right
tools, you can do it.

00:12:25.850 --> 00:12:28.340
And teaching emotional
intelligence is the same way.

00:12:28.340 --> 00:12:30.776
You can basically
develop a new type

00:12:30.776 --> 00:12:32.150
of nature, a new
type of ability,

00:12:32.150 --> 00:12:34.608
that you've never had before,
and that wouldn't necessarily

00:12:34.608 --> 00:12:36.420
come natural to
you to begin with.

00:12:36.420 --> 00:12:37.940
So that's what we're working on.

00:12:37.940 --> 00:12:40.410
Let me tell you a little bit
more about how we do that.

00:12:40.410 --> 00:12:41.661
One of the things that we do--

00:12:41.661 --> 00:12:43.993
and this is very important
when you're working in groups

00:12:43.993 --> 00:12:46.430
or in entire organizations--
is that we help to create

00:12:46.430 --> 00:12:47.935
a culture of humility.

00:12:47.935 --> 00:12:49.310
This is really,
really important.

00:12:49.310 --> 00:12:50.780
Because, otherwise, what
happens is you bring people

00:12:50.780 --> 00:12:52.370
into the room and you're
like, well, you're

00:12:52.370 --> 00:12:53.990
the pessimistic one,
and you're the problem.

00:12:53.990 --> 00:12:55.430
And you're the one that's
being really difficult.

00:12:55.430 --> 00:12:57.140
And you're the problem
person in our team.

00:12:57.140 --> 00:12:59.510
And then that person, of
course, becomes very defensive.

00:12:59.510 --> 00:13:00.890
And everyone else feels
very self-righteous.

00:13:00.890 --> 00:13:02.357
And nobody learns anything.

00:13:02.357 --> 00:13:04.940
So we work very hard to begin
by saying, this thing that we're

00:13:04.940 --> 00:13:06.170
going to learn
today, whether it's

00:13:06.170 --> 00:13:08.360
about communication, whether
it's about playfulness,

00:13:08.360 --> 00:13:11.090
is a problem and an opportunity
for every single one of us

00:13:11.090 --> 00:13:12.030
in this room.

00:13:12.030 --> 00:13:14.390
All of us have this strange
quirky thing about us

00:13:14.390 --> 00:13:15.590
that makes it difficult.

00:13:15.590 --> 00:13:18.170
Or, in other words, we
are all crazy, right?

00:13:18.170 --> 00:13:20.800
We're all just nuts, barely
holding it together people

00:13:20.800 --> 00:13:21.560
some days.

00:13:21.560 --> 00:13:23.300
And all of us need
help on this thing.

00:13:23.300 --> 00:13:25.633
And it's actually really
helpful if someone like the CEO

00:13:25.633 --> 00:13:27.940
can stand up and be,
like, hello, I'm an idiot.

00:13:27.940 --> 00:13:30.090
Yes, I'm an idiot in
the following ways.

00:13:30.090 --> 00:13:30.590
It's good.

00:13:30.590 --> 00:13:32.330
Because, first of all,
in most companies,

00:13:32.330 --> 00:13:34.580
at least some people are
already thinking that the CEO

00:13:34.580 --> 00:13:35.540
is a bit of an idiot.

00:13:35.540 --> 00:13:37.310
But it's actually
really reassuring

00:13:37.310 --> 00:13:39.980
to see someone like a
CEO say, you know, I'm

00:13:39.980 --> 00:13:41.180
aware of my idiocy.

00:13:41.180 --> 00:13:42.290
It's not escaped me.

00:13:42.290 --> 00:13:43.350
I'm working on it.

00:13:43.350 --> 00:13:44.600
And that's true for all of us.

00:13:44.600 --> 00:13:46.600
We try to create a culture
where people can say,

00:13:46.600 --> 00:13:48.290
I know I have various
eccentricities.

00:13:48.290 --> 00:13:50.831
You know, I don't mean crazy,
of course, about mental health.

00:13:50.831 --> 00:13:52.361
I mean human
instability in general.

00:13:52.361 --> 00:13:53.360
But I'm working on them.

00:13:53.360 --> 00:13:54.140
I understand them.

00:13:54.140 --> 00:13:55.310
I know I'm not perfect.

00:13:55.310 --> 00:13:57.380
That creates a really open
culture in a community

00:13:57.380 --> 00:13:59.300
and in an organization
and in a team.

00:13:59.300 --> 00:14:01.550
So we work very hard in the
structure of our workshops

00:14:01.550 --> 00:14:04.430
and all the way that we
present our materials to say,

00:14:04.430 --> 00:14:06.980
this is something everyone can
work on, nobody's perfect at,

00:14:06.980 --> 00:14:09.277
and everybody can learn.

00:14:09.277 --> 00:14:11.110
This really helps us
overcome defensiveness.

00:14:11.110 --> 00:14:13.070
We want people to
be open to the idea,

00:14:13.070 --> 00:14:14.690
and actually want
to learn, and learn

00:14:14.690 --> 00:14:16.860
new tools that could help them.

00:14:16.860 --> 00:14:18.030
Another thing that we do--

00:14:18.030 --> 00:14:19.655
and this is very
important-- is that we

00:14:19.655 --> 00:14:21.740
help people not only
learn, but repeat, learn

00:14:21.740 --> 00:14:24.260
over and over and over again
and practice over and over

00:14:24.260 --> 00:14:27.440
and over again the important
skills that we believe in.

00:14:27.440 --> 00:14:29.720
Because a lot of
education in the world

00:14:29.720 --> 00:14:32.510
tends to think about sort of
the human mind is a bucket.

00:14:32.510 --> 00:14:34.880
Like, you are going to
spend maybe a day or a week

00:14:34.880 --> 00:14:36.717
or a year pouring
in some information.

00:14:36.717 --> 00:14:38.300
And then after a
while, you've got it.

00:14:38.300 --> 00:14:39.758
And it's in there,
and that's good.

00:14:39.758 --> 00:14:41.720
And you're done, and
nothing else is needed.

00:14:41.720 --> 00:14:43.553
And at The School of
Life, especially around

00:14:43.553 --> 00:14:45.500
emotional skills, we
disagree completely.

00:14:45.500 --> 00:14:47.270
We think the human mind
is really, really fragile.

00:14:47.270 --> 00:14:48.430
It forgets things really easily.

00:14:48.430 --> 00:14:49.429
It means well, you know.

00:14:49.429 --> 00:14:50.254
But it slips.

00:14:50.254 --> 00:14:51.920
We think we should
be kind and generous.

00:14:51.920 --> 00:14:53.600
And that sounds really
great in the moment

00:14:53.600 --> 00:14:55.340
when you're listening to
someone talk to you about it.

00:14:55.340 --> 00:14:56.810
But then, you know, an
hour later, you're hungry.

00:14:56.810 --> 00:14:58.040
And two hours later,
you have an email.

00:14:58.040 --> 00:14:59.817
And you forget by
the end of the day.

00:14:59.817 --> 00:15:02.150
So we really think the human
mind is a bit like a sieve,

00:15:02.150 --> 00:15:02.550
right?

00:15:02.550 --> 00:15:03.924
And as a result,
we think that we

00:15:03.924 --> 00:15:06.649
need to repeat everything to do
with intelligence quite a bit.

00:15:06.649 --> 00:15:07.940
We need to practice constantly.

00:15:07.940 --> 00:15:09.230
We need good reminders.

00:15:09.230 --> 00:15:11.210
We need interesting,
intelligent, sensitive,

00:15:11.210 --> 00:15:12.110
appealing reminders.

00:15:12.110 --> 00:15:13.750
Because no matter
how wonderful we are,

00:15:13.750 --> 00:15:15.333
it is going to slip
through our minds.

00:15:15.333 --> 00:15:17.015
We are going to need to refresh.

00:15:17.015 --> 00:15:19.140
We're not the only people
that believe this either,

00:15:19.140 --> 00:15:19.980
by the way.

00:15:19.980 --> 00:15:22.521
Some of the very first teachers
of emotional intelligence, so

00:15:22.521 --> 00:15:24.830
to speak, however flawed in
other ways, were religions.

00:15:24.830 --> 00:15:26.396
And religions
believe this as well.

00:15:26.396 --> 00:15:28.520
They think that people need
to repeat all the time,

00:15:28.520 --> 00:15:30.620
that they need to be reminded
to be kind in the morning.

00:15:30.620 --> 00:15:32.390
And then after lunch, they
need to be reminded again,

00:15:32.390 --> 00:15:34.640
because they forgot over
the course of lunch, right?

00:15:34.640 --> 00:15:35.640
It's not because people are bad.

00:15:35.640 --> 00:15:37.590
They just recognize
this about human beings.

00:15:37.590 --> 00:15:38.840
We need to be
reminded constantly,

00:15:38.840 --> 00:15:40.840
or we're going to get
home at the end of the day

00:15:40.840 --> 00:15:43.082
and snap at our partners
and yell at our children.

00:15:43.082 --> 00:15:44.540
And so we kind of
base some of what

00:15:44.540 --> 00:15:47.702
we do on the structure
of movements like this,

00:15:47.702 --> 00:15:49.910
or meditation, things like
that, because we recognize

00:15:49.910 --> 00:15:51.417
the value of that aspect.

00:15:51.417 --> 00:15:53.750
The other thing we try to do
is just make it interesting

00:15:53.750 --> 00:15:54.291
and engaging.

00:15:54.291 --> 00:15:56.812
We work really hard to actually
present things in a way

00:15:56.812 --> 00:15:58.520
that people will say,
yeah, that's right.

00:15:58.520 --> 00:15:59.720
That appeals to me.

00:15:59.720 --> 00:16:01.580
You can see this a bit in our
YouTube channel, of course,

00:16:01.580 --> 00:16:03.329
which is very popular,
but also in the way

00:16:03.329 --> 00:16:04.632
that we do our workshops.

00:16:04.632 --> 00:16:06.590
These are some funny
slides from our workshops.

00:16:06.590 --> 00:16:07.845
And they just have
really appealing quotes.

00:16:07.845 --> 00:16:09.890
They have interesting
historical facts that you're

00:16:09.890 --> 00:16:12.306
unlikely to forget, strange
art, like that funky art there

00:16:12.306 --> 00:16:14.675
at the top, you
know, good metaphors.

00:16:14.675 --> 00:16:16.550
The point is we want it
to stick in the brain

00:16:16.550 --> 00:16:18.800
as long as possible before
it slides through the sieve.

00:16:18.800 --> 00:16:20.841
So we're very, very
interested in beauty as well.

00:16:20.841 --> 00:16:22.490
We think beauty
brings ideas to life.

00:16:22.490 --> 00:16:26.370
And that's true, of course, with
these little products as well.

00:16:26.370 --> 00:16:28.130
And all of this is
designed, ultimately,

00:16:28.130 --> 00:16:30.992
to help people be more
aware of what they're like.

00:16:30.992 --> 00:16:33.200
People don't need to be
perfect at the end of the day

00:16:33.200 --> 00:16:34.730
to be emotionally intelligent.

00:16:34.730 --> 00:16:37.029
What they need to
do most of all is

00:16:37.029 --> 00:16:38.570
to be aware of the
ways in which they

00:16:38.570 --> 00:16:40.982
are imperfect to be able to
navigate a little bit better,

00:16:40.982 --> 00:16:42.940
to acknowledge when they
might have screwed up,

00:16:42.940 --> 00:16:45.120
to look for places
where they can improve.

00:16:45.120 --> 00:16:46.340
That's the ultimate goal.

00:16:46.340 --> 00:16:49.100
None of us will be perfect, but
all of us can be a bit better.

00:16:49.100 --> 00:16:51.020
This has to do with
self-awareness.

00:16:51.020 --> 00:16:54.000
We encourage all this regular
reflection, these exercises.

00:16:54.000 --> 00:16:57.230
They're all geared in some
way towards self-awareness.

00:16:57.230 --> 00:16:59.535
And rather than go on and
on about self-awareness now,

00:16:59.535 --> 00:17:01.160
I'm actually going
to give you a chance

00:17:01.160 --> 00:17:04.369
to try it out with one of
our most popular exercises,

00:17:04.369 --> 00:17:06.260
the philosophical meditation.

00:17:06.260 --> 00:17:08.180
So I'd love to encourage
you for a minute.

00:17:08.180 --> 00:17:10.050
It's good to write things
down during this exercise.

00:17:10.050 --> 00:17:11.660
So if you want, you
might get out something

00:17:11.660 --> 00:17:12.701
you write things down on.

00:17:12.701 --> 00:17:14.660
It's your phone, or
a little notebook,

00:17:14.660 --> 00:17:17.810
or something like that.

00:17:17.810 --> 00:17:21.400
And I'll explain a little
bit about this as well.

00:17:21.400 --> 00:17:23.750
A lot of traditional
meditation, especially

00:17:23.750 --> 00:17:27.290
the way it's been
brought in to the West,

00:17:27.290 --> 00:17:30.079
has to do with the idea of
trying to empty our minds.

00:17:30.079 --> 00:17:32.120
And in a sense, that can
imply that maybe there's

00:17:32.120 --> 00:17:34.370
not anything that useful to
know about the things that

00:17:34.370 --> 00:17:35.330
are floating around in there.

00:17:35.330 --> 00:17:37.426
Maybe we don't need to
investigate them too much.

00:17:37.426 --> 00:17:39.050
This is a bit of an
overgeneralization.

00:17:39.050 --> 00:17:41.701
I know there's very complicated
different strands of meditation

00:17:41.701 --> 00:17:42.200
in the East.

00:17:42.200 --> 00:17:44.300
But the point is that we
sometimes lose the thread.

00:17:44.300 --> 00:17:46.383
We might think, oh, what
I need to do to calm down

00:17:46.383 --> 00:17:49.232
is just not investigate
the content of my mind.

00:17:49.232 --> 00:17:50.690
But at The School
of Life, we think

00:17:50.690 --> 00:17:52.620
it's actually really important.

00:17:52.620 --> 00:17:54.980
So rather than trying
to empty the mind

00:17:54.980 --> 00:17:56.626
or become more
aware of our body,

00:17:56.626 --> 00:17:59.000
although those things can be
useful for people sometimes,

00:17:59.000 --> 00:18:00.666
we're actually very
interested in things

00:18:00.666 --> 00:18:03.410
like downloading the mind, and
sorting through the feelings

00:18:03.410 --> 00:18:06.200
and ideas that we have, and
interpreting the anxieties

00:18:06.200 --> 00:18:08.270
and hurts and excitements
that might be in there,

00:18:08.270 --> 00:18:10.478
but which we haven't fully
recognized and interpreted

00:18:10.478 --> 00:18:11.151
for ourselves.

00:18:11.151 --> 00:18:13.400
We're going to get a chance
to do that today, at least

00:18:13.400 --> 00:18:14.720
with one of these sections.

00:18:14.720 --> 00:18:17.240
Maybe we'll start with
anxiety, because my intuition

00:18:17.240 --> 00:18:19.550
is that most people have
anxieties, a lot of anxieties,

00:18:19.550 --> 00:18:20.840
throughout the day.

00:18:20.840 --> 00:18:23.999
So, first of all, I might say
that many people do this a lot.

00:18:23.999 --> 00:18:25.790
Some people that come
to The School of Life

00:18:25.790 --> 00:18:28.376
end up doing this regularly,
maybe for even an hour or so.

00:18:28.376 --> 00:18:30.500
And it's a good one to take
home and try out again.

00:18:30.500 --> 00:18:33.470
I like to say that our exercises
are a bit like Ikea furniture.

00:18:33.470 --> 00:18:34.940
So you can take
them home with you.

00:18:34.940 --> 00:18:37.040
And then you kind of construct
them in a good way for yourself

00:18:37.040 --> 00:18:37.680
there.

00:18:37.680 --> 00:18:39.410
But we're just
getting a taste now.

00:18:39.410 --> 00:18:42.030
You're just getting
the pieces now.

00:18:42.030 --> 00:18:45.010
So these are the
usual three questions

00:18:45.010 --> 00:18:46.950
of philosophical meditation.

00:18:46.950 --> 00:18:48.380
What am I anxious about?

00:18:48.380 --> 00:18:49.760
What am I upset about?

00:18:49.760 --> 00:18:50.949
And what am I excited about?

00:18:50.949 --> 00:18:52.490
They're just good
starting questions.

00:18:52.490 --> 00:18:55.480
They help us think about
what's going on in our life.

00:18:55.480 --> 00:18:58.070
And I'd love to suggest
that we start with this one.

00:18:58.070 --> 00:19:00.020
What am I presently
anxious about?

00:19:00.020 --> 00:19:03.144
So I would suggest that you
write down for a minute or two

00:19:03.144 --> 00:19:05.060
as many as you can think
of things that you're

00:19:05.060 --> 00:19:05.870
anxious about.

00:19:05.870 --> 00:19:08.000
You can do shorthand, so
none of your colleagues

00:19:08.000 --> 00:19:08.660
know what it means.

00:19:08.660 --> 00:19:10.618
You know, it might just
say K. Or it might just

00:19:10.618 --> 00:19:13.624
say 10:30 or something, as
much shorthand as you need.

00:19:13.624 --> 00:19:16.290
And then in a minute, we'll do a
little bit more with that list.

00:19:19.610 --> 00:19:22.250
There's even some
suggested categories here

00:19:22.250 --> 00:19:24.350
at the top in case
you're thinking of things

00:19:24.350 --> 00:19:27.110
and can't quite drum some up--

00:19:27.110 --> 00:19:31.220
work, relationships,
family, health, sex, money,

00:19:31.220 --> 00:19:32.360
things I have to do.

00:19:38.020 --> 00:19:40.609
Once you've written down a few,
you might just choose three.

00:19:40.609 --> 00:19:43.150
And the three are going to be
the ones that you unpack, maybe

00:19:43.150 --> 00:19:47.080
even two since this
is a short talk.

00:19:47.080 --> 00:19:49.660
And you're just going to begin
to unpack them a little bit.

00:19:49.660 --> 00:19:52.000
It's kind of like separating
out the different strands

00:19:52.000 --> 00:19:54.056
of thought that have
to do with that topic.

00:19:54.056 --> 00:19:56.680
So there's a suggestion here of
how you might do that unpacking

00:19:56.680 --> 00:19:57.217
anxiety.

00:19:57.217 --> 00:19:59.800
You might want to complete the
following sentences around each

00:19:59.800 --> 00:20:00.640
of those two things.

00:20:00.640 --> 00:20:03.610
Let's say one of them has
to do with an argument

00:20:03.610 --> 00:20:05.030
that you had with your partner.

00:20:05.030 --> 00:20:07.230
So you would complete
the sentences in regard

00:20:07.230 --> 00:20:07.990
to that thing.

00:20:07.990 --> 00:20:09.744
What I'm really afraid
will happen is--

00:20:09.744 --> 00:20:11.410
and you'll think about
is it that you're

00:20:11.410 --> 00:20:13.760
worried that the relationship
is getting worse?

00:20:13.760 --> 00:20:16.093
Is it that you're worried
that there might be a breakup?

00:20:16.093 --> 00:20:19.300
Is it that you're worried
that your needs won't be met?

00:20:19.300 --> 00:20:21.710
Kind of trying to be as honest
with yourself as possible,

00:20:21.710 --> 00:20:22.930
what is the underlying fear?

00:20:22.930 --> 00:20:25.610
It's not just that fights
are unpleasant, of course.

00:20:25.610 --> 00:20:27.280
What ultimately might
be the bad thing?

00:20:30.640 --> 00:20:32.712
After that, you might
want to consider

00:20:32.712 --> 00:20:33.920
what you want to do about it.

00:20:33.920 --> 00:20:34.970
Is there actually
something that you

00:20:34.970 --> 00:20:37.011
could do that would,
perhaps, reduce the anxiety,

00:20:37.011 --> 00:20:39.387
or at least take the issue
further in a constructive way?

00:20:39.387 --> 00:20:41.886
It's good to first figure out
what you're afraid of, though.

00:20:41.886 --> 00:20:43.726
Sometimes people
jump right to action,

00:20:43.726 --> 00:20:46.100
but we need a little bit of
skepticism about the emotions

00:20:46.100 --> 00:20:48.245
before we can choose
actions wisely.

00:20:53.080 --> 00:20:57.010
And, finally, you can move on
to the point about reassurance.

00:20:57.010 --> 00:20:58.957
So it's really containment
and reassurance,

00:20:58.957 --> 00:21:01.540
by which we mean that you're not
going to let the anxiety take

00:21:01.540 --> 00:21:03.520
over your whole life
and color everything

00:21:03.520 --> 00:21:04.460
else that's going on.

00:21:04.460 --> 00:21:06.990
You're going to begin to
bring it back down to scale.

00:21:06.990 --> 00:21:09.844
What is, you know, the limit
on this particular anxiety?

00:21:09.844 --> 00:21:11.260
So the worst thing
that can happen

00:21:11.260 --> 00:21:13.884
is, in some ways the limit, you
might think, OK, absolute worst

00:21:13.884 --> 00:21:14.950
case, we break up.

00:21:14.950 --> 00:21:16.810
That would be
terrible, but I guess

00:21:16.810 --> 00:21:18.224
I would do this in that case.

00:21:18.224 --> 00:21:19.390
I could see my friends more.

00:21:19.390 --> 00:21:21.250
For some people, this
is very reassuring,

00:21:21.250 --> 00:21:23.740
because it contains the problem
to scale that is, perhaps,

00:21:23.740 --> 00:21:26.790
smaller than civil war, right?

00:21:26.790 --> 00:21:28.540
We can also think about
how we would cope.

00:21:28.540 --> 00:21:29.956
That can often be
very reassuring.

00:21:29.956 --> 00:21:30.824
I would take baths.

00:21:30.824 --> 00:21:31.990
I would see my friends more.

00:21:31.990 --> 00:21:34.576
I would complain to my
parents, whatever it is.

00:21:34.576 --> 00:21:35.950
These are kind of
silly examples,

00:21:35.950 --> 00:21:37.241
but you probably have your own.

00:21:37.241 --> 00:21:40.360
So think a little bit about how
you might contain your anxiety

00:21:40.360 --> 00:21:42.544
and maybe offer yourself
some reassurance.

00:21:42.544 --> 00:21:43.960
And then in a
minute, if you like,

00:21:43.960 --> 00:21:45.490
you'll have a chance to
just share with the person

00:21:45.490 --> 00:21:46.939
next to you how
this was for you.

00:21:46.939 --> 00:21:48.730
And if you like, you
can share the details.

00:21:48.730 --> 00:21:51.650
Of course, you don't have to.

00:21:51.650 --> 00:21:55.027
So in a minute, I'll open it up.

00:21:55.027 --> 00:21:57.110
When you're ready, do turn
to someone next to you.

00:21:57.110 --> 00:21:58.535
And just mention how this was.

00:21:58.535 --> 00:21:59.660
What did you get out of it?

00:21:59.660 --> 00:22:02.460
If you like, you can share the
details, but you don't have to.

00:22:02.460 --> 00:22:04.585
And then we'll come back
together in a few minutes.

00:22:06.908 --> 00:22:12.331
[INTERPOSING VOICES]

00:22:35.909 --> 00:22:37.700
SARAH STEIN LUBRANO:
I'd love to hear maybe

00:22:37.700 --> 00:22:40.730
from just one or two people
what that was like for you.

00:22:40.730 --> 00:22:41.600
Was it helpful?

00:22:41.600 --> 00:22:44.090
What part of it was hopeful
if anything was helpful?

00:22:44.090 --> 00:22:45.240
Or if not, that's OK, too.

00:22:45.240 --> 00:22:45.740
Yeah.

00:22:45.740 --> 00:22:46.740
I think we've got a mic.

00:22:46.740 --> 00:22:48.530
Can we bring it over?

00:22:48.530 --> 00:22:50.074
Thank you.

00:22:50.074 --> 00:22:50.990
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]?

00:22:50.990 --> 00:22:51.769
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

00:22:51.769 --> 00:22:53.060
SARAH STEIN LUBRANO: Great, hi.

00:22:53.060 --> 00:22:55.722
AUDIENCE: I'm actually going
to steal this gentleman's point

00:22:55.722 --> 00:22:57.180
that he made when
we were chatting.

00:22:57.180 --> 00:22:58.180
SARAH STEIN LUBRANO: OK.

00:22:58.180 --> 00:23:00.280
AUDIENCE: It was
really beneficial.

00:23:00.280 --> 00:23:02.240
I took two to work on.

00:23:02.240 --> 00:23:03.470
One was really beneficial.

00:23:03.470 --> 00:23:04.120
SARAH STEIN LUBRANO: Yup.

00:23:04.120 --> 00:23:06.370
AUDIENCE: Because it made
me seem like my worries sort

00:23:06.370 --> 00:23:07.789
of were a bit insignificant.

00:23:07.789 --> 00:23:09.330
And I could just,
like, move past it.

00:23:09.330 --> 00:23:11.160
But then one went
really horrible.

00:23:11.160 --> 00:23:12.347
So I just thought in sum--

00:23:12.347 --> 00:23:13.430
SARAH STEIN LUBRANO: Yeah.

00:23:13.430 --> 00:23:17.720
AUDIENCE: --when you
pick some worries, what

00:23:17.720 --> 00:23:19.430
I'm really afraid
will happen is,

00:23:19.430 --> 00:23:21.230
that bit can get
a bit horrible, do

00:23:21.230 --> 00:23:21.860
you know what I mean sometimes?

00:23:21.860 --> 00:23:22.210
SARAH STEIN LUBRANO: Sure, yeah.

00:23:22.210 --> 00:23:24.001
AUDIENCE: So I think
it can work both ways.

00:23:24.001 --> 00:23:26.340
But I think, generally, it's
like a nice beneficial way

00:23:26.340 --> 00:23:27.340
to work through it and--

00:23:27.340 --> 00:23:27.800
SARAH STEIN LUBRANO: Yeah.

00:23:27.800 --> 00:23:30.304
AUDIENCE: --just be able
to sort of like prioritize

00:23:30.304 --> 00:23:31.970
and work through your
worries one by one

00:23:31.970 --> 00:23:33.080
is a really nice way
of looking at it,

00:23:33.080 --> 00:23:35.710
which I think everyone in this
group maybe hadn't done before.

00:23:35.710 --> 00:23:37.385
So it was nice to
do it like that.

00:23:37.385 --> 00:23:37.730
SARAH STEIN LUBRANO: Yeah.

00:23:37.730 --> 00:23:38.930
And perhaps a
second issue, there

00:23:38.930 --> 00:23:40.160
are other ways of
thinking about it.

00:23:40.160 --> 00:23:40.910
AUDIENCE: Yeah, absolutely.

00:23:40.910 --> 00:23:42.910
SARAH STEIN LUBRANO: It's
certainly no cure-all,

00:23:42.910 --> 00:23:44.072
but nothing really is.

00:23:44.072 --> 00:23:44.780
AUDIENCE: Thanks.

00:23:44.780 --> 00:23:45.863
SARAH STEIN LUBRANO: Yeah.

00:23:45.863 --> 00:23:46.747
Thank you.

00:23:46.747 --> 00:23:48.830
And you begin to also look
at the nice things that

00:23:48.830 --> 00:23:50.204
are floating around
in your mind,

00:23:50.204 --> 00:23:51.540
but don't get enough attention.

00:23:51.540 --> 00:23:54.180
So in other words, we're
thinking about how sometimes

00:23:54.180 --> 00:23:55.180
our mind notices things.

00:23:55.180 --> 00:23:58.040
And it really likes them and
latches onto them for a minute.

00:23:58.040 --> 00:23:59.415
But then, you know, it forgets.

00:23:59.415 --> 00:24:01.790
And by the end of the day,
you don't remember what it is.

00:24:01.790 --> 00:24:03.706
And, actually, you had
a nice intuition there,

00:24:03.706 --> 00:24:05.030
but you might lose it.

00:24:05.030 --> 00:24:06.904
So these are rather
exciting thoughts.

00:24:06.904 --> 00:24:09.320
Or it might be that it's a
little bit troubling sometimes.

00:24:09.320 --> 00:24:10.040
We envy someone.

00:24:10.040 --> 00:24:11.300
That's not very comfortable.

00:24:11.300 --> 00:24:13.040
But, nevertheless,
the envy is telling us

00:24:13.040 --> 00:24:15.320
something about what we
might actually really like

00:24:15.320 --> 00:24:16.352
to do in the future.

00:24:16.352 --> 00:24:18.560
So these are areas of
excitement, things that they're

00:24:18.560 --> 00:24:20.851
a little bit appealing to us
for one reason or another,

00:24:20.851 --> 00:24:23.809
things we'd really like to get
more into in our life, perhaps.

00:24:23.809 --> 00:24:25.350
And we need to learn
to identify them

00:24:25.350 --> 00:24:29.090
more, so that we can explore
new positive things in our life.

00:24:29.090 --> 00:24:31.852
So just for a minute,
I'd love to let's

00:24:31.852 --> 00:24:34.310
think about someone who made
you either excited, intrigued,

00:24:34.310 --> 00:24:36.435
or envious, which are all
very interesting words.

00:24:36.435 --> 00:24:38.810
You know, someone you felt,
ah, their job is really cool.

00:24:38.810 --> 00:24:42.134
Or their way of talking
to me is really appealing.

00:24:42.134 --> 00:24:44.300
Or I'd really like to have
something that they have.

00:24:44.300 --> 00:24:45.860
You don't have to
question it too much.

00:24:45.860 --> 00:24:47.570
You don't have to feel
guilty about feeling envious,

00:24:47.570 --> 00:24:49.580
because the point here is to
try to take the thing that they

00:24:49.580 --> 00:24:51.320
have and to try to
think about what you

00:24:51.320 --> 00:24:53.877
yourself might really
be attracted to in life.

00:24:53.877 --> 00:24:55.460
And that can be a
really helpful thing

00:24:55.460 --> 00:24:58.372
to know about yourself
just for a minute.

00:24:58.372 --> 00:25:00.830
First things that come to mind,
even if it's a bit strange,

00:25:00.830 --> 00:25:01.680
as an exercise.

00:25:06.466 --> 00:25:07.840
You could also
think about really

00:25:07.840 --> 00:25:09.851
pleasant, interesting,
unusual experiences

00:25:09.851 --> 00:25:11.350
you've had recently,
maybe something

00:25:11.350 --> 00:25:13.210
that took you by surprise,
because it was nicer

00:25:13.210 --> 00:25:14.430
than you thought it would be.

00:25:14.430 --> 00:25:15.370
That's more comfortable.

00:25:15.370 --> 00:25:16.630
But I've given you
the hard task first.

00:25:16.630 --> 00:25:18.910
Now, the easy task, what
was really appealing?

00:25:18.910 --> 00:25:21.120
What was really nice recently?

00:25:25.880 --> 00:25:28.760
Once you've written
down some of these hints

00:25:28.760 --> 00:25:31.732
as to your future interests,
you might begin to unpack them.

00:25:31.732 --> 00:25:33.190
So you might think
about, well, now

00:25:33.190 --> 00:25:35.180
that I've met this
person, what's something

00:25:35.180 --> 00:25:37.640
that I might want to explore
more, or try more, or do

00:25:37.640 --> 00:25:38.596
differently?

00:25:38.596 --> 00:25:40.970
Or, if I wanted to get more
experiences like the one that

00:25:40.970 --> 00:25:43.800
surprised me by being so
nice, what might I need to do?

00:25:47.470 --> 00:25:50.490
The last little section here
says plans from excitement.

00:25:50.490 --> 00:25:52.240
And it's a bit tricky,
because it's really

00:25:52.240 --> 00:25:54.970
thinking about what you could
concretely do in your life,

00:25:54.970 --> 00:25:57.520
like little actual
attainable steps

00:25:57.520 --> 00:26:00.130
that you could act on as a
result of this excitement.

00:26:00.130 --> 00:26:01.600
And perhaps the
nicest thing to do

00:26:01.600 --> 00:26:03.516
is maybe talk to the
other person next to you.

00:26:03.516 --> 00:26:06.332
Just talk to someone
slightly different.

00:26:06.332 --> 00:26:07.790
And each of you,
for a few minutes,

00:26:07.790 --> 00:26:10.490
talk about what your plans
for your excitement might be.

00:26:10.490 --> 00:26:13.330
What could you do as a result
of this interesting moment

00:26:13.330 --> 00:26:14.337
that you had?

00:26:14.337 --> 00:26:16.420
So just for a few minutes
talk to the other person

00:26:16.420 --> 00:26:17.336
the other side of you.

00:26:17.336 --> 00:26:19.660
Or, you know, slightly
switch your partners,

00:26:19.660 --> 00:26:21.940
and think about
what kinds of plans

00:26:21.940 --> 00:26:25.866
could you make in response
to this excitement?

00:26:25.866 --> 00:26:33.610
[INTERPOSING VOICES]

00:26:33.610 --> 00:26:35.830
Let's share a few
if you don't mind.

00:26:35.830 --> 00:26:40.984
I'd really love to hear some of
your plans, some of your plans

00:26:40.984 --> 00:26:41.650
from excitement.

00:26:41.650 --> 00:26:43.360
I can yell more loudly.

00:26:43.360 --> 00:26:46.270
I used to have a, like,
triangle and a gong.

00:26:46.270 --> 00:26:49.950
But let's come back
together if you don't mind.

00:26:53.380 --> 00:26:53.960
Yeah.

00:26:53.960 --> 00:26:56.210
Hello.

00:26:56.210 --> 00:26:57.980
Does anyone have a
plan from excitement

00:26:57.980 --> 00:27:01.370
that they'd really
love to share?

00:27:01.370 --> 00:27:03.710
Something that came
up that you could do?

00:27:06.300 --> 00:27:07.490
No?

00:27:07.490 --> 00:27:08.930
A moment that was very exciting?

00:27:11.750 --> 00:27:12.660
So shy.

00:27:12.660 --> 00:27:13.160
Well.

00:27:13.160 --> 00:27:15.435
Yeah?

00:27:15.435 --> 00:27:17.810
AUDIENCE: I would definitely
apply for another internship

00:27:17.810 --> 00:27:18.310
at Google.

00:27:18.310 --> 00:27:19.640
[LAUGHTER]

00:27:19.640 --> 00:27:21.150
SARAH STEIN LUBRANO: Excellent.

00:27:21.150 --> 00:27:21.780
What else?

00:27:25.966 --> 00:27:28.090
AUDIENCE: I think it was
a little bit of difficulty

00:27:28.090 --> 00:27:31.570
to define what would be
the unusual experience that

00:27:31.570 --> 00:27:34.226
gets you excited
or a person that

00:27:34.226 --> 00:27:35.350
gets you extremely excited.

00:27:35.350 --> 00:27:38.230
Like, to me, there
was nothing that's

00:27:38.230 --> 00:27:40.300
extremely exciting last
time that you can't stand

00:27:40.300 --> 00:27:41.330
yourself kind of excitement.

00:27:41.330 --> 00:27:42.120
That's the [INAUDIBLE].

00:27:42.120 --> 00:27:43.240
SARAH STEIN LUBRANO: What about,
like, moderately exciting?

00:27:43.240 --> 00:27:44.531
AUDIENCE: But that's the thing.

00:27:44.531 --> 00:27:46.300
Like, I was only
thinking, when I read

00:27:46.300 --> 00:27:48.730
excitement, of that extreme.

00:27:48.730 --> 00:27:50.710
And, like, I couldn't
remember anything that's

00:27:50.710 --> 00:27:52.240
in the last year probably.

00:27:52.240 --> 00:27:54.400
But that does not mean
that there weren't probably

00:27:54.400 --> 00:27:55.030
smaller things.

00:27:55.030 --> 00:27:55.390
SARAH STEIN LUBRANO: Yeah.

00:27:55.390 --> 00:27:56.380
AUDIENCE: They just
wouldn't come to your mind,

00:27:56.380 --> 00:27:58.600
because you never
registered them as--

00:27:58.600 --> 00:27:58.960
SARAH STEIN LUBRANO:
Exactly, yeah.

00:27:58.960 --> 00:28:00.310
AUDIENCE: --oh my
god, they're exciting.

00:28:00.310 --> 00:28:02.310
SARAH STEIN LUBRANO: It's
sometimes hard for us.

00:28:02.310 --> 00:28:03.580
We lose track of them, right?

00:28:03.580 --> 00:28:05.450
We often like to say that you
should maybe keep a journal.

00:28:05.450 --> 00:28:08.110
And then the point isn't to
say beautiful, elaborate things

00:28:08.110 --> 00:28:08.740
every sentence.

00:28:08.740 --> 00:28:09.698
It's to just take note.

00:28:09.698 --> 00:28:12.700
Like, that was quite interesting
this morning before you forget.

00:28:12.700 --> 00:28:16.240
Otherwise, we have less data
available to us, effectively.

00:28:16.240 --> 00:28:19.010
Really, the point here isn't
that this is the only thing

00:28:19.010 --> 00:28:19.540
we do at The School of Life.

00:28:19.540 --> 00:28:21.670
It's rather that it's just
one of many, many, many things

00:28:21.670 --> 00:28:23.694
that we do here at the
philosophical meditation.

00:28:23.694 --> 00:28:25.360
And the point is that,
as you mentioned,

00:28:25.360 --> 00:28:28.030
we have a lot of unthought
thoughts and unfelt feelings.

00:28:28.030 --> 00:28:29.260
And they can elude us.

00:28:29.260 --> 00:28:31.150
But we need time
to reflect on them.

00:28:31.150 --> 00:28:33.850
Mental good health requires
us to constantly download

00:28:33.850 --> 00:28:36.220
our minds and sort
out their contents.

00:28:36.220 --> 00:28:38.860
And once these things become a
little bit easier to identify,

00:28:38.860 --> 00:28:41.414
the fears and resentments
and hopes, then it

00:28:41.414 --> 00:28:43.330
can be a little bit
easier to understand them.

00:28:43.330 --> 00:28:45.640
And we become calmer, and
less resentful, and clearer,

00:28:45.640 --> 00:28:49.132
ultimately, about
what we want in life.

00:28:49.132 --> 00:28:50.840
At this point, I'd
love to, first of all,

00:28:50.840 --> 00:28:52.270
thank you for coming
and sticking with it

00:28:52.270 --> 00:28:53.603
even though it's a bit strange--

00:28:53.603 --> 00:28:54.594
I know some of it.

00:28:54.594 --> 00:28:56.260
And I'd also love to
say that, you know,

00:28:56.260 --> 00:28:58.690
if you have any
questions, I'm now free.

00:28:58.690 --> 00:29:02.944
And I can answer them
or take comments, too.

00:29:02.944 --> 00:29:03.610
AUDIENCE: Sorry.

00:29:03.610 --> 00:29:05.167
We were just talking.

00:29:05.167 --> 00:29:06.250
SARAH STEIN LUBRANO: Yeah.

00:29:06.250 --> 00:29:10.210
AUDIENCE: I was wondering
really, in terms of practicing,

00:29:10.210 --> 00:29:12.430
you were mentioning
that earlier.

00:29:12.430 --> 00:29:14.720
In terms of that
excitement meditation,

00:29:14.720 --> 00:29:15.970
the philosophical meditation--

00:29:15.970 --> 00:29:16.870
SARAH STEIN LUBRANO: Yeah.

00:29:16.870 --> 00:29:17.860
AUDIENCE: --do you
think that we should be

00:29:17.860 --> 00:29:19.510
doing that kind of regularly?

00:29:19.510 --> 00:29:20.170
Is that--

00:29:20.170 --> 00:29:21.460
SARAH STEIN LUBRANO: Yes.

00:29:21.460 --> 00:29:21.730
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

00:29:21.730 --> 00:29:23.350
Because it's easy
to sit there and go,

00:29:23.350 --> 00:29:25.180
oh, you know, carry
on for two years.

00:29:25.180 --> 00:29:27.430
And then go, oh, now, I
need to reassess my life.

00:29:27.430 --> 00:29:28.840
But sometimes--

00:29:28.840 --> 00:29:30.100
SARAH STEIN LUBRANO: Yeah, I
think it's much more useful.

00:29:30.100 --> 00:29:32.170
I mean, it's nice that we
had a taste of it here.

00:29:32.170 --> 00:29:33.530
But it's even more useful
as you practice it.

00:29:33.530 --> 00:29:34.850
Just like with
eastern meditation

00:29:34.850 --> 00:29:36.254
also, right, people
get "better,"

00:29:36.254 --> 00:29:37.420
quote unquote at meditating.

00:29:37.420 --> 00:29:39.100
It becomes more
beneficial to them.

00:29:39.100 --> 00:29:40.641
And in the same way,
the more that we

00:29:40.641 --> 00:29:43.120
start taking note of these
little bits of anxiety,

00:29:43.120 --> 00:29:45.970
and excitement, and upset,
and so on, the more likely

00:29:45.970 --> 00:29:48.550
we are to generate these very
long lists we can look through

00:29:48.550 --> 00:29:49.300
and say, oh, look.

00:29:49.300 --> 00:29:51.130
These things that excited me
are related to each other,

00:29:51.130 --> 00:29:52.338
you know, or they're similar.

00:29:52.338 --> 00:29:54.430
Or I tend to be
very excited when

00:29:54.430 --> 00:29:56.432
I have spontaneous
experiences, but I don't

00:29:56.432 --> 00:29:57.640
let myself do that very much.

00:29:57.640 --> 00:30:00.520
So the more that we practice
it probably the more we'll

00:30:00.520 --> 00:30:02.410
get out of it for sure.

00:30:02.410 --> 00:30:03.340
AUDIENCE: Hi.

00:30:03.340 --> 00:30:04.900
SARAH STEIN LUBRANO: Yes.

00:30:04.900 --> 00:30:07.150
AUDIENCE: You briefly
touched on this.

00:30:07.150 --> 00:30:10.105
But I was just wondering
what you think about

00:30:10.105 --> 00:30:14.620
should this kind of stuff be
taught more formally in school.

00:30:14.620 --> 00:30:16.270
Because I know when
I was in school--

00:30:16.270 --> 00:30:17.353
SARAH STEIN LUBRANO: Yeah.

00:30:17.353 --> 00:30:21.700
AUDIENCE: --the focus is
entirely academic or athletic.

00:30:21.700 --> 00:30:24.850
And so only kids who excelled
in those things, like,

00:30:24.850 --> 00:30:26.377
felt good about themselves.

00:30:26.377 --> 00:30:27.460
SARAH STEIN LUBRANO: Yeah.

00:30:27.460 --> 00:30:29.939
AUDIENCE: And there were kids
with lots of other talents

00:30:29.939 --> 00:30:30.730
that were kind of--

00:30:30.730 --> 00:30:33.271
SARAH STEIN LUBRANO: Yeah, we
absolutely think in the future.

00:30:33.271 --> 00:30:35.290
We got a whole
section in our blog,

00:30:35.290 --> 00:30:37.150
actually, in our
book of life, where

00:30:37.150 --> 00:30:38.980
we talk about sort of utopia.

00:30:38.980 --> 00:30:41.020
And we talk about the
utopia of education

00:30:41.020 --> 00:30:44.027
and how much more of our time,
probably, in the education

00:30:44.027 --> 00:30:46.360
system could be well-spent
learning some of these things

00:30:46.360 --> 00:30:47.860
and practicing some
of these things.

00:30:47.860 --> 00:30:50.800
Because, first of all, like
sieves rather than buckets,

00:30:50.800 --> 00:30:52.250
we forget a lot
of the information

00:30:52.250 --> 00:30:53.458
that's given to us in school.

00:30:53.458 --> 00:30:56.080
There are so many things
that we just don't remember.

00:30:56.080 --> 00:30:58.390
But second of all,
because information

00:30:58.390 --> 00:31:00.295
is constantly more and
more available to us.

00:31:00.295 --> 00:31:02.170
But the ability to
regulate our own emotions,

00:31:02.170 --> 00:31:03.040
that takes a lot of time.

00:31:03.040 --> 00:31:04.456
You've really got
to invest in it.

00:31:04.456 --> 00:31:06.920
And we'd love to see it
more widely available,

00:31:06.920 --> 00:31:08.660
especially to children
and young people,

00:31:08.660 --> 00:31:10.390
but also to older People
we can all learn together.

00:31:10.390 --> 00:31:11.770
Like, 70-year-olds
and 7-year-olds

00:31:11.770 --> 00:31:13.436
could be learning
this together actually

00:31:13.436 --> 00:31:15.645
maybe in a really useful way.

00:31:15.645 --> 00:31:17.020
AUDIENCE: I get
really frustrated

00:31:17.020 --> 00:31:18.436
when I feel like
people don't have

00:31:18.436 --> 00:31:19.790
any emotional intelligence.

00:31:19.790 --> 00:31:20.160
SARAH STEIN LUBRANO: Yeah.

00:31:20.160 --> 00:31:22.284
AUDIENCE: Because I feel
like I've got a lot of it.

00:31:22.284 --> 00:31:25.270
And I request-- I feel that I
need that from other people.

00:31:25.270 --> 00:31:28.999
How would you suggest
that I try not to get

00:31:28.999 --> 00:31:30.290
frustrated in those situations?

00:31:30.290 --> 00:31:32.530
What advice would you give me
for dealing with people that,

00:31:32.530 --> 00:31:33.420
you know, would see
this and they'd be like,

00:31:33.420 --> 00:31:34.340
I don't want to go to that talk.

00:31:34.340 --> 00:31:35.131
I'm not interested.

00:31:35.131 --> 00:31:37.210
Or, you know, you try
and explain how you feel.

00:31:37.210 --> 00:31:39.085
And they're just not
interested, because they

00:31:39.085 --> 00:31:40.174
don't understand it.

00:31:40.174 --> 00:31:41.840
SARAH STEIN LUBRANO:
Well, first of all,

00:31:41.840 --> 00:31:44.381
in general about anger at The
School of Life and frustration,

00:31:44.381 --> 00:31:48.850
we tend to say that our anger is
equivalent to our expectations,

00:31:48.850 --> 00:31:49.350
right?

00:31:49.350 --> 00:31:50.860
If we have very
high expectations,

00:31:50.860 --> 00:31:52.570
probably they're going to be
disappointed some of the time.

00:31:52.570 --> 00:31:54.910
And then our anger will
be very intense as well.

00:31:54.910 --> 00:31:58.120
So, frankly, we believe in what
we call strategic pessimism

00:31:58.120 --> 00:32:00.250
and not just at work, but
in general around people.

00:32:00.250 --> 00:32:02.370
They are going to disappoint
quite a bit of the time.

00:32:02.370 --> 00:32:04.703
And it's actually very helpful
to lower our expectations

00:32:04.703 --> 00:32:06.100
a little bit to practice.

00:32:06.100 --> 00:32:08.284
We really like Seneca
who was a philosopher.

00:32:08.284 --> 00:32:09.700
And he said that
you should get up

00:32:09.700 --> 00:32:11.350
in the morning and have
a pray [? meditatio, ?]

00:32:11.350 --> 00:32:12.460
where you think about
all the things that

00:32:12.460 --> 00:32:13.780
could go wrong during the day.

00:32:13.780 --> 00:32:14.900
And there's a lot of them.

00:32:14.900 --> 00:32:15.940
And the nice thing
isn't that at the end

00:32:15.940 --> 00:32:17.230
you feel horribly
anxious, hopefully.

00:32:17.230 --> 00:32:19.750
But that over time you realize,
OK, well, most of these people

00:32:19.750 --> 00:32:21.160
didn't go to the emotional
intelligence talk

00:32:21.160 --> 00:32:23.534
and said really ridiculous
emotionally intelligent things

00:32:23.534 --> 00:32:24.170
in the meeting.

00:32:24.170 --> 00:32:25.961
But this person actually
said a nice thing.

00:32:25.961 --> 00:32:28.940
So it allows us to be less
angry and, perhaps, less upset,

00:32:28.940 --> 00:32:31.340
but also to appreciate more
when things do go well.

00:32:31.340 --> 00:32:32.340
That's a starting point.

00:32:32.340 --> 00:32:33.714
And, also, you
can give them, you

00:32:33.714 --> 00:32:36.009
know, secret gift certificates
to The School Life

00:32:36.009 --> 00:32:36.550
or something.

00:32:36.550 --> 00:32:37.380
But--

00:32:37.380 --> 00:32:38.213
AUDIENCE: Thank you.

00:32:38.213 --> 00:32:39.810
SARAH STEIN LUBRANO:
Yeah, of course.

00:32:39.810 --> 00:32:41.310
AUDIENCE: So thank
you for the talk.

00:32:41.310 --> 00:32:42.222
SARAH STEIN LUBRANO: Yeah.

00:32:42.222 --> 00:32:42.722
Pleasure.

00:32:42.722 --> 00:32:44.240
AUDIENCE: There is
this thing called

00:32:44.240 --> 00:32:47.537
EQ, which is basically IQ test
for emotional intelligence.

00:32:47.537 --> 00:32:48.620
SARAH STEIN LUBRANO: Yeah.

00:32:48.620 --> 00:32:50.120
AUDIENCE: So what
do you think of it

00:32:50.120 --> 00:32:53.012
as a way of measuring
emotional intelligence?

00:32:53.012 --> 00:32:54.470
SARAH STEIN LUBRANO:
I mean, people

00:32:54.470 --> 00:32:56.110
have made a lot
of tests for this.

00:32:56.110 --> 00:32:59.834
And it's not for me to go and
evaluate that particular test.

00:32:59.834 --> 00:33:01.250
In general, at The
School of life,

00:33:01.250 --> 00:33:03.820
we like to test a little bit
more like taking your pulse.

00:33:03.820 --> 00:33:05.060
It's a little bit
more human-sized.

00:33:05.060 --> 00:33:06.768
And, also, people
change a lot, you know?

00:33:06.768 --> 00:33:09.560
And some of these tests might be
more credible than other ones.

00:33:09.560 --> 00:33:11.750
So we tend to think it's
more useful if you're

00:33:11.750 --> 00:33:13.220
thinking about your
emotional intelligence rather

00:33:13.220 --> 00:33:14.390
than if we're telling
you from the outside,

00:33:14.390 --> 00:33:16.899
like, this is your level
of emotional intelligence.

00:33:16.899 --> 00:33:18.690
But we do have little
tests and diagnostics

00:33:18.690 --> 00:33:19.850
you can do for yourself.

00:33:19.850 --> 00:33:21.601
And it's less like
saying, you know,

00:33:21.601 --> 00:33:23.350
this is your likelihood
of a heart attack.

00:33:23.350 --> 00:33:24.680
And it's more like saying,
you know, why don't you

00:33:24.680 --> 00:33:25.346
take your pulse?

00:33:25.346 --> 00:33:27.680
What's your pulse
like right now?

00:33:27.680 --> 00:33:30.339
So that tends to be our approach
to diagnostics I would say.

00:33:30.339 --> 00:33:31.880
But, you know, it's
nice other people

00:33:31.880 --> 00:33:34.160
are doing other things I guess.

00:33:34.160 --> 00:33:36.770
AUDIENCE: So you contrasted
your approach quite dramatically

00:33:36.770 --> 00:33:39.770
to regular mindfulness
where you try to suppress

00:33:39.770 --> 00:33:41.717
or abstract away from
emotions and kind of--

00:33:41.717 --> 00:33:42.800
SARAH STEIN LUBRANO: Yeah.

00:33:42.800 --> 00:33:44.250
AUDIENCE: Can you
elaborate a bit?

00:33:44.250 --> 00:33:47.147
What are the strengths and
weaknesses of each approach?

00:33:47.147 --> 00:33:48.230
SARAH STEIN LUBRANO: Yeah.

00:33:48.230 --> 00:33:50.510
I mean, I'm not an expert
in Eastern mindfulness.

00:33:50.510 --> 00:33:53.570
So I'm going to have to kind
of put that enormous bracket

00:33:53.570 --> 00:33:56.030
around what I'm saying now.

00:33:56.030 --> 00:33:57.680
Some of the types
of meditation that

00:33:57.680 --> 00:34:00.092
are very common in the
West which have been,

00:34:00.092 --> 00:34:01.550
through a very
complicated process,

00:34:01.550 --> 00:34:05.420
translated from much older
sometimes religious techniques,

00:34:05.420 --> 00:34:07.490
tend to allow us to empty
our mind in the sense

00:34:07.490 --> 00:34:09.531
that they don't focus on
the content of the worry

00:34:09.531 --> 00:34:11.179
so much as they ask
you to release it.

00:34:11.179 --> 00:34:13.424
And that can be a
very good thing.

00:34:13.424 --> 00:34:15.590
But one of the reasons we're
interested in examining

00:34:15.590 --> 00:34:17.256
the contents of the
mind is our interest

00:34:17.256 --> 00:34:20.389
in psychology and
psychoanalysis and philosophy.

00:34:20.389 --> 00:34:22.380
I think there's space
for both in the world.

00:34:22.380 --> 00:34:25.130
And one of the ways that there's
particularly space for both

00:34:25.130 --> 00:34:26.239
is that it's
important, in general,

00:34:26.239 --> 00:34:28.219
to interrogate our anxieties
and our excitements,

00:34:28.219 --> 00:34:29.780
but we can't hold
onto them forever.

00:34:29.780 --> 00:34:31.654
And some of them are
not immediately fixable.

00:34:31.654 --> 00:34:33.800
Like, global warming, we
can all do a little bit.

00:34:33.800 --> 00:34:35.360
But, you know, if we sit
all day long thinking

00:34:35.360 --> 00:34:37.010
about the worst case
scenario for global warming,

00:34:37.010 --> 00:34:38.389
we're going to have a hard time.

00:34:38.389 --> 00:34:40.909
So I think the goal
is to be able to sort

00:34:40.909 --> 00:34:42.500
out from our
anxieties, you know,

00:34:42.500 --> 00:34:44.020
this one about my
relationship where

00:34:44.020 --> 00:34:46.850
I have some way of learning
and understanding more and then

00:34:46.850 --> 00:34:47.820
doing better.

00:34:47.820 --> 00:34:49.639
I'm going to really
investigate first.

00:34:49.639 --> 00:34:51.514
And maybe this other
one where I can't really

00:34:51.514 --> 00:34:53.510
do anything, or the more
intelligent approach

00:34:53.510 --> 00:34:54.949
won't make any difference,
because I don't have

00:34:54.949 --> 00:34:56.270
the power in that situation.

00:34:56.270 --> 00:34:57.980
That might be a
really good space.

00:34:57.980 --> 00:34:59.570
And mindfulness,
Eastern mindfulness,

00:34:59.570 --> 00:35:01.320
has a lot of other
benefits, which, again,

00:35:01.320 --> 00:35:04.140
I'm not an expert on,
but are separate as well.

00:35:04.140 --> 00:35:06.130
Does that make sense?

00:35:06.130 --> 00:35:07.630
It's kind of about
how much you need

00:35:07.630 --> 00:35:09.421
to think about the
thing to do better at it

00:35:09.421 --> 00:35:11.172
versus where it won't help.

00:35:11.172 --> 00:35:12.880
AUDIENCE: In the
beginning, you mentioned

00:35:12.880 --> 00:35:17.432
that you recommend to be
skeptical of your own emotions

00:35:17.432 --> 00:35:18.890
and, also, other
people's emotions.

00:35:18.890 --> 00:35:20.050
SARAH STEIN LUBRANO: Yeah.

00:35:20.050 --> 00:35:21.030
AUDIENCE: But on
the other hand, we

00:35:21.030 --> 00:35:22.930
have to be careful not
to dismiss other people's

00:35:22.930 --> 00:35:23.370
feelings.

00:35:23.370 --> 00:35:23.680
SARAH STEIN LUBRANO: Yeah.

00:35:23.680 --> 00:35:25.390
AUDIENCE: Like when someone
comes to me and says,

00:35:25.390 --> 00:35:27.370
they're anxious, then
I don't want to say,

00:35:27.370 --> 00:35:29.810
but here's a reason why
we shouldn't be anxious.

00:35:29.810 --> 00:35:30.230
SARAH STEIN LUBRANO: Sure.

00:35:30.230 --> 00:35:31.771
AUDIENCE: I don't
think your anxious.

00:35:31.771 --> 00:35:34.720
So how do you strike the
balance between this?

00:35:34.720 --> 00:35:36.220
SARAH STEIN LUBRANO:
Well, it sounds

00:35:36.220 --> 00:35:37.970
like it's mostly about
other people's, not

00:35:37.970 --> 00:35:40.386
kind of telling people what
they're feeling, which I think

00:35:40.386 --> 00:35:41.540
is very important.

00:35:41.540 --> 00:35:44.380
So I think the idea is more
to open up possibilities

00:35:44.380 --> 00:35:46.330
before we choose an
action, rather than

00:35:46.330 --> 00:35:48.246
to tell the other person
what they're feeling.

00:35:48.246 --> 00:35:51.160
Like, if a person comes to us
and they're very angry at us,

00:35:51.160 --> 00:35:56.070
it's probably more helpful
for us to first ask, you know,

00:35:56.070 --> 00:35:57.752
maybe some mitigating
circumstances.

00:35:57.752 --> 00:35:59.710
Like, oh, this person is
under a lot of stress.

00:35:59.710 --> 00:36:01.630
This allows me to be slightly
more patient with them.

00:36:01.630 --> 00:36:03.820
Or maybe this person is anxious
about a thing I haven't even

00:36:03.820 --> 00:36:05.770
thought about and I
don't know about at home.

00:36:05.770 --> 00:36:07.840
It's not that we then tell
them this is the situation.

00:36:07.840 --> 00:36:09.850
It's that we're almost
able to be more curious

00:36:09.850 --> 00:36:12.810
and ask them and not immediately
judge and rush to action.

00:36:12.810 --> 00:36:14.815
Does that make sense?

00:36:14.815 --> 00:36:16.060
Yeah.

00:36:16.060 --> 00:36:16.560
Hello

00:36:16.560 --> 00:36:17.750
AUDIENCE: Hi.

00:36:17.750 --> 00:36:20.420
You mentioned at the beginning
of the talk defensiveness.

00:36:20.420 --> 00:36:21.770
SARAH STEIN LUBRANO:
Defensiveness, yeah.

00:36:21.770 --> 00:36:23.210
AUDIENCE: And I
was just wondering

00:36:23.210 --> 00:36:26.530
if you are dealing with people
who are extremely defensive

00:36:26.530 --> 00:36:29.340
and you can see that it's
coming from a place of anxiety

00:36:29.340 --> 00:36:33.290
or fear, what would you advise?

00:36:33.290 --> 00:36:35.194
What is the best
approach in your opinion?

00:36:35.194 --> 00:36:36.860
SARAH STEIN LUBRANO:
Oh, I mean, there's

00:36:36.860 --> 00:36:39.590
lots of different techniques
for dealing with defensiveness.

00:36:39.590 --> 00:36:41.256
The main thing, first
of all, is to deal

00:36:41.256 --> 00:36:42.710
with our own defensiveness.

00:36:42.710 --> 00:36:44.960
You know, our school is
about changing ourselves more

00:36:44.960 --> 00:36:47.081
than other people.

00:36:47.081 --> 00:36:49.580
I think the other thing is to
remember that we're defensive,

00:36:49.580 --> 00:36:51.770
because we often think
that our value is attached

00:36:51.770 --> 00:36:53.960
to the criticism the
person is making.

00:36:53.960 --> 00:36:56.792
So we talk a lot in
our classes, especially

00:36:56.792 --> 00:36:58.250
in our classes
around work, that we

00:36:58.250 --> 00:37:00.590
want to make the
criticisms as we have

00:37:00.590 --> 00:37:02.875
them enormously local, right?

00:37:02.875 --> 00:37:05.250
So that it's very clear to
the person as much as possible

00:37:05.250 --> 00:37:06.920
that this isn't about their
value as a human being

00:37:06.920 --> 00:37:09.170
or even necessarily whether
they're good at their job.

00:37:09.170 --> 00:37:11.270
It's just this particular
paper on line three,

00:37:11.270 --> 00:37:13.430
I wonder if we could make
it a little bit more x.

00:37:13.430 --> 00:37:14.971
So one of the things
we work on doing

00:37:14.971 --> 00:37:17.477
is making criticism
very, very local.

00:37:17.477 --> 00:37:19.310
Because the fear of a
person who's defensive

00:37:19.310 --> 00:37:22.110
is that their whole
being is being judged.

00:37:22.110 --> 00:37:24.689
It's also very good to choose
the time and place and manner

00:37:24.689 --> 00:37:25.730
where you give criticism.

00:37:25.730 --> 00:37:26.810
And sometimes it's
easier to give it,

00:37:26.810 --> 00:37:28.940
you know, out for coffee after
you've already had a nice chat.

00:37:28.940 --> 00:37:30.270
And there's lots of other ways.

00:37:30.270 --> 00:37:32.936
But that's a good starting point
sometimes to make it very local

00:37:32.936 --> 00:37:36.104
and to watch it
in ourselves, too.

00:37:36.104 --> 00:37:39.397
AUDIENCE: I feel a bit like
I've seen some an Ikea catalog.

00:37:39.397 --> 00:37:40.980
SARAH STEIN LUBRANO:
Yeah, definitely.

00:37:40.980 --> 00:37:41.700
That's what you've seen.

00:37:41.700 --> 00:37:42.830
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE] brought
home any furniture yet.

00:37:42.830 --> 00:37:45.025
SARAH STEIN LUBRANO:
100%, it's right here.

00:37:45.025 --> 00:37:47.590
AUDIENCE: Yeah, like, what's
your next suggestion to action?

00:37:47.590 --> 00:37:50.332
Is it like signing up for
a class, buying a book?

00:37:50.332 --> 00:37:52.290
SARAH STEIN LUBRANO: All
those things are good.

00:37:52.290 --> 00:37:55.620
We like to do things in
many different formats.

00:37:55.620 --> 00:37:57.150
It really depends
on what you need.

00:37:57.150 --> 00:37:59.233
I can also talk to you
after if you're like, well,

00:37:59.233 --> 00:38:01.050
this is the thing I'm
most interested in.

00:38:01.050 --> 00:38:03.216
Because we know people
benefit from different things

00:38:03.216 --> 00:38:05.250
depending on what
they're facing.

00:38:05.250 --> 00:38:06.625
I love our workshops
and classes.

00:38:06.625 --> 00:38:08.083
I think they're
really interesting,

00:38:08.083 --> 00:38:10.487
because you get to see not
just what you're working with,

00:38:10.487 --> 00:38:12.570
but what other people are
thinking about and going

00:38:12.570 --> 00:38:13.070
through.

00:38:13.070 --> 00:38:14.880
And that is particularly
valuable for me.

00:38:14.880 --> 00:38:15.740
I really enjoy that.

00:38:15.740 --> 00:38:17.367
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:38:17.367 --> 00:38:19.200
SARAH STEIN LUBRANO:
Not yet, but maybe some

00:38:19.200 --> 00:38:20.010
will be skeptical.

00:38:20.010 --> 00:38:21.720
And, also, they happened in
our Bloomsbury classroom.

00:38:21.720 --> 00:38:23.262
So you can kind of
go and get a taste

00:38:23.262 --> 00:38:24.886
there of some of our
business workshops

00:38:24.886 --> 00:38:26.430
and also some of
our public classes.

00:38:26.430 --> 00:38:27.138
But, yeah, it is.

00:38:27.138 --> 00:38:28.590
It's an IKEA catalog.

00:38:28.590 --> 00:38:31.904
The whole School of Life
in 40 minutes is tough.

00:38:31.904 --> 00:38:33.570
AUDIENCE: Yeah, I
think I was just going

00:38:33.570 --> 00:38:36.130
to ask a similar question.

00:38:36.130 --> 00:38:39.487
You know, we talked about
individuals and, also, maybe

00:38:39.487 --> 00:38:41.820
getting our team to be more
aware of their own emotional

00:38:41.820 --> 00:38:42.900
intelligence.

00:38:42.900 --> 00:38:44.419
Do you do team
building exercises--

00:38:44.419 --> 00:38:45.460
SARAH STEIN LUBRANO: Yup.

00:38:45.460 --> 00:38:46.050
AUDIENCE: --along that front?

00:38:46.050 --> 00:38:46.320
SARAH STEIN LUBRANO: Yes.

00:38:46.320 --> 00:38:48.256
Some of our-- are
about sort of what

00:38:48.256 --> 00:38:50.130
does our team need to
do in order to do this.

00:38:50.130 --> 00:38:52.980
Or some are quite useful
in terms of, like,

00:38:52.980 --> 00:38:55.410
allowing the whole group to
reflect together and come up

00:38:55.410 --> 00:38:57.480
with ideas and
suggestions together.

00:38:57.480 --> 00:38:59.070
So, yeah, it varies
on the topic,

00:38:59.070 --> 00:39:04.336
of course, how individual
versus team built, but yeah.

one more question?

I see people starting to leave.

be here after as well

00:39:12.098 --> 00:39:14.042
