00:00:02.752 --> 00:00:06.047
NARRATOR: While it may seem
unthinkable that pyramids could

00:00:06.047 --> 00:00:10.051
exist in Antarctica,
in recent years,

00:00:10.051 --> 00:00:13.138
archaeologists have found
pyramids all over the world

00:00:13.138 --> 00:00:15.890
that had been lost
for centuries,

00:00:15.890 --> 00:00:19.936
mistaken as natural
formations or hidden

00:00:19.936 --> 00:00:22.689
in the most unlikely places.

00:00:22.689 --> 00:00:27.652
They have been discovered in the
plains of Northern Peru, buried

00:00:27.652 --> 00:00:30.655
beneath dirt and
rubble in Indonesia,

00:00:30.655 --> 00:00:35.577
and one may even exist in
Los Angeles, California.

00:00:35.577 --> 00:00:38.121
All the way around
the world, we find

00:00:38.121 --> 00:00:41.249
evidence of pyramid structures.

00:00:41.249 --> 00:00:44.377
We should start looking
at the possibility

00:00:44.377 --> 00:00:49.466
that there was
habitation on Antarctica.

00:00:49.466 --> 00:00:52.886
Was it a lost civilization?

00:00:52.886 --> 00:00:55.930
Could it be ancient astronauts?

00:00:55.930 --> 00:00:58.683
And just maybe the
earliest monuments

00:00:58.683 --> 00:01:04.731
of our own civilization came
originally from Antarctica.

00:01:04.731 --> 00:01:07.942
If this gigantic
pyramid in Antarctica

00:01:07.942 --> 00:01:12.739
is an artificial structure, it
would probably be the oldest

00:01:12.739 --> 00:01:15.200
pyramid on our planet.

00:01:15.200 --> 00:01:17.911
And in fact, it might
be the master pyramid

00:01:17.911 --> 00:01:21.164
that all the other
pyramids on planet Earth

00:01:21.164 --> 00:01:24.876
were designed to look like.

00:01:24.876 --> 00:01:28.213
There has been extensive
research done on pyramids

00:01:28.213 --> 00:01:30.965
throughout the world in
terms of their structure

00:01:30.965 --> 00:01:33.468
and what it is that
they really are.

00:01:33.468 --> 00:01:37.931
And one of the theories is that
pyramids are power generators.

00:01:37.931 --> 00:01:41.017
And so if you have these
pyramids strategically placed

00:01:41.017 --> 00:01:43.645
around the world
generating this charge,

00:01:43.645 --> 00:01:47.482
it's possible to create
a general standing wave

00:01:47.482 --> 00:01:49.567
around the world
that is basically

00:01:49.567 --> 00:01:54.447
a wireless
transmission of energy.

00:01:54.447 --> 00:01:58.117
It's been theorized
that ancient ships,

00:01:58.117 --> 00:02:01.037
extraterrestrials and
those with high technology,

00:02:01.037 --> 00:02:06.376
could use this interconnected
wireless energy system

00:02:06.376 --> 00:02:09.295
to navigate around the planet.

00:02:09.295 --> 00:02:13.633
And it makes sense that
if there was some kind

00:02:13.633 --> 00:02:21.140
of worldwide pyramid power
grid like this, that Antarctica

00:02:21.140 --> 00:02:25.186
would have pyramids as well.

00:02:25.186 --> 00:02:29.440
The whole idea of these
pyramidal structures,

00:02:29.440 --> 00:02:31.192
where did it come from?

00:02:31.192 --> 00:02:33.319
It's not an arbitrary thing.

00:02:33.319 --> 00:02:35.738
And these structures,
they exist worldwide.

00:02:35.738 --> 00:02:38.199
So what was the impetus?

00:02:38.199 --> 00:02:39.868
What's the origin?

00:02:39.868 --> 00:02:43.538
And even more fascinating,
did they originate

00:02:43.538 --> 00:02:45.206
on the Antarctic continent?

00:02:49.669 --> 00:02:51.546
NARRATOR: Might the
pyramid Joseph White

00:02:51.546 --> 00:02:55.174
claims to have discovered near
the Shackleton Mountain Range,

00:02:55.174 --> 00:02:58.219
and other pyramid-shaped
formations recently

00:02:58.219 --> 00:03:01.973
photographed in Antarctica,
provide evidence

00:03:01.973 --> 00:03:05.018
of extraterrestrial
visitation to our planet

00:03:05.018 --> 00:03:08.229
in the remote past?

00:03:08.229 --> 00:03:11.691
And if they are actually
man-made structures,

00:03:11.691 --> 00:03:14.777
how is such a thing
even possible in a place

00:03:14.777 --> 00:03:20.491
that has been buried beneath the
ice for over 12 million years?

00:03:20.491 --> 00:03:23.202
According to ancient
astronaut theorists,

00:03:23.202 --> 00:03:27.498
Antarctica may not have been
a frozen continent for as long

00:03:27.498 --> 00:03:29.250
as mainstream
scientists suggest.

00:03:32.003 --> 00:03:35.715
And they say proof can
be found by examining

00:03:35.715 --> 00:03:42.680
a 500-year-old map depicting
the continent without any ice.
