00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.435
- They put cameras,
you could go online

00:00:02.435 --> 00:00:03.903
and see the Titanic
at any time you want.

00:00:03.903 --> 00:00:05.138
- That's pretty cool.

00:00:05.138 --> 00:00:06.339
- [Radio Host] Then
it would protect--

00:00:06.339 --> 00:00:07.507
- So, in a way
they're gonna turn

00:00:07.507 --> 00:00:08.742
the Titanic into a
webcam girl (laughing)?

00:00:08.742 --> 00:00:11.811
- Yeah, the first, like,
uh, the first, yeah...

00:00:11.811 --> 00:00:14.114
- Do you wanna see
a piece of my hull?

00:00:14.114 --> 00:00:18.385
- You wanna see an old doll
that rotted in the ocean?

00:00:18.385 --> 00:00:20.253
- This is a blanket

00:00:20.253 --> 00:00:22.722
from the captain's room.
- Oh, hey guys.

00:00:22.722 --> 00:00:24.324
(imitating water bubbling)

00:00:24.324 --> 00:00:26.960
All the coins.
(imitating water bubbling)

00:00:26.960 --> 00:00:29.763
Oh, I guess I could
go grab a plate.

00:00:29.763 --> 00:00:32.332
(imitating water bubbling)
(guys laugh)

00:00:32.332 --> 00:00:33.967
- But, um...

00:00:33.967 --> 00:00:38.438
- Wanna see a sticky
wagon wheel from an old...

00:00:38.438 --> 00:00:41.841
- Mm, this is a
pearl hair brush.

00:00:41.841 --> 00:00:45.879
(laughs)
(imitating water bubbling)

00:00:45.879 --> 00:00:47.113
- This is a very serious topic.

00:00:47.113 --> 00:00:48.148
- I'm so sorry, Jacob.

00:00:48.148 --> 00:00:49.783
I didn't mean to
turn the Titanic

00:00:49.783 --> 00:00:51.684
into a webcam girl.
- I apologize.

00:00:51.684 --> 00:00:55.488
(heavy guitar music)

00:00:55.488 --> 00:00:59.159
- So, to catch up, Sal, on
what we're talking about

00:00:59.159 --> 00:01:02.328
is a girl flipped
out on her boyfriend

00:01:02.328 --> 00:01:05.131
and keyed his car
and he filmed it.

00:01:05.131 --> 00:01:06.466
And Jay saw it on Worldstar,

00:01:06.466 --> 00:01:08.535
and we talked about
it on The Bonfire.

00:01:08.535 --> 00:01:11.171
This is the video, it's like
maybe a 30 second video.

00:01:12.439 --> 00:01:14.007
- You think I care? (laughs)
- [Dan] Oh man.

00:01:14.007 --> 00:01:15.141
- I don't care anymore!

00:01:15.141 --> 00:01:15.942
- Ah!
- [Boyfriend] Quit hitting me.

00:01:15.942 --> 00:01:17.043
- I've lost my mind!

00:01:17.043 --> 00:01:17.877
- [Boyfriend] Quit hitting me.

00:01:17.877 --> 00:01:19.612
- I've lost my mind!

00:01:19.612 --> 00:01:22.916
(key scratching car)
(beep)

00:01:22.916 --> 00:01:24.317
- Yeah.
(beep)

00:01:24.317 --> 00:01:25.785
- [Boyfriend] You
need to give a (beep).

00:01:25.785 --> 00:01:28.088
That's cool, I've got video
proof of you doing this.

00:01:28.088 --> 00:01:29.055
You're crazy, bruh.

00:01:29.055 --> 00:01:30.290
You're crazy.

00:01:30.290 --> 00:01:31.724
Let me leave, you
have me blocked in.

00:01:31.724 --> 00:01:33.526
Let me leave, you're
kidnapping me.

00:01:33.526 --> 00:01:35.695
Let me leave, leave me
alone, let me leave.

00:01:35.695 --> 00:01:37.597
- I just totally
understand that point,

00:01:37.597 --> 00:01:38.865
because I've gotten there
so many times where I go,

00:01:38.865 --> 00:01:40.667
okay now, but I'm
being serious now.

00:01:40.667 --> 00:01:41.901
You gotta move
because I gotta leave.

00:01:41.901 --> 00:01:43.203
You're gonna get me in trouble.

00:01:43.203 --> 00:01:44.771
You're gonna get me
in trouble at work.

00:01:44.771 --> 00:01:47.607
- I've said that I've done
that thing with Christine

00:01:47.607 --> 00:01:51.611
where if we're arguing
and she'll be like,

00:01:51.611 --> 00:01:53.947
"Jay, stop," or put
a hand on my arm,

00:01:53.947 --> 00:01:55.548
and I go, "I don't
want you to touch me.

00:01:55.548 --> 00:01:57.250
"You're assaulting me,
technically, right now."

00:01:57.250 --> 00:01:58.518
(laughing)

00:01:58.518 --> 00:01:59.352
"You're assaulting me by
touching me right now.

00:01:59.352 --> 00:02:00.753
"You know that, right?

00:02:00.753 --> 00:02:01.554
"I don't wanna be
touched by you right now,

00:02:01.554 --> 00:02:02.822
"and you're touching me!

00:02:02.822 --> 00:02:04.057
"You're assaulting me!"

00:02:04.057 --> 00:02:05.458
- Habeas corpus, right
now this is a mistrial.

00:02:05.458 --> 00:02:06.693
It's a double jeopardy.

00:02:06.693 --> 00:02:08.194
You can't get em twice
for the same crime.

00:02:08.194 --> 00:02:09.629
- Get off my property--
- Yeah. (laughs)

00:02:09.629 --> 00:02:12.999
- Napoleon Dynamite. (laughs)
- You're on my property.

00:02:12.999 --> 00:02:14.067
- You assaulted me.

00:02:14.067 --> 00:02:15.602
You're assaulting me.

00:02:15.602 --> 00:02:18.138
- I have accused Christine of
assault 75 times in our house.

00:02:18.138 --> 00:02:20.707
- You know drunk
Christine accuses you

00:02:20.707 --> 00:02:23.076
of not being able
to produce anything.

00:02:23.076 --> 00:02:24.711
(laughs)
- It's true.

00:02:24.711 --> 00:02:25.545
- I don't know if
you know this...

00:02:25.545 --> 00:02:26.913
- It does get volatile.

00:02:26.913 --> 00:02:28.448
- You don't have a
producer bone in your body.

00:02:28.448 --> 00:02:30.817
- [Jay] You don't have a
production bone in your body.

00:02:30.817 --> 00:02:32.018
- One of my favorite,

00:02:32.018 --> 00:02:34.020
because it's such a
sweet, funny thing to me

00:02:34.020 --> 00:02:35.388
that you were going,

00:02:35.388 --> 00:02:36.689
you don't have a production
bone in your body.

00:02:36.689 --> 00:02:39.526
- I wanna see if I
can ever cut the video

00:02:39.526 --> 00:02:41.361
of it just for Lou to
get the audio of it,

00:02:41.361 --> 00:02:42.862
it's a great thing.

00:02:42.862 --> 00:02:44.030
- Here's the thing though,
you gotta ask Christine.

00:02:44.030 --> 00:02:45.765
Because hearing your drunk self

00:02:45.765 --> 00:02:47.634
is on of the worst
things in the world.

00:02:47.634 --> 00:02:48.868
It's like seeing
yourself as a werewolf.

00:02:48.868 --> 00:02:51.204
- If Christine doesn't believe

00:02:51.204 --> 00:02:53.940
that one of the funniest
things ever in the world

00:02:53.940 --> 00:02:58.912
to be said out loud is, you
think I'm so susposable.

00:02:59.546 --> 00:03:01.114
(group laughing)

00:03:01.114 --> 00:03:02.048
Well I go, "Susposable?"

00:03:02.048 --> 00:03:03.416
And she goes, "Yeah."

00:03:03.416 --> 00:03:04.817
She goes, "Susposable."

00:03:04.817 --> 00:03:06.085
She goes, "It's a word Jay,

00:03:06.085 --> 00:03:08.054
"look it up in the
Urban dictionary."

00:03:08.054 --> 00:03:09.923
And then I went, "I'll look
it up where ever you want me

00:03:09.923 --> 00:03:11.491
"to look it up, that's
not a word anywhere."

00:03:11.491 --> 00:03:14.627
And she goes, "Exactly."
(group laughing)

00:03:14.627 --> 00:03:16.196
- That's so funny.

00:03:16.196 --> 00:03:18.565
She did the Cecily Strong girl

00:03:18.565 --> 00:03:20.099
you never wanna
talk to at a party.

00:03:20.099 --> 00:03:21.334
- Yeah, yes.

00:03:21.334 --> 00:03:22.835
- You became that,
that's who you are.

00:03:22.835 --> 00:03:24.637
- While she's putting all
her makeup back in her bag,

00:03:24.637 --> 00:03:26.039
because she dumped the purse out

00:03:26.039 --> 00:03:28.608
three times in one
conversation by accident.

00:03:28.608 --> 00:03:30.476
- Yeah, there was...
- Where's my favorite penny?

00:03:30.476 --> 00:03:32.879
- So anyways, to bring
everyone up to point,

00:03:32.879 --> 00:03:35.715
that's who we're calling,
the girl from this video.

00:03:35.715 --> 00:03:37.984
- Her name...
- Black Lou, what's her name?

00:03:37.984 --> 00:03:40.520
- Her name is Autumn Rowe.
- Autumn Rowe.

00:03:40.520 --> 00:03:43.289
- Okay.
Cute chick.

00:03:43.289 --> 00:03:44.591
- Very friendly.
- Super hot.

00:03:44.591 --> 00:03:46.626
And Black Lou you've
talked to her already.

00:03:46.626 --> 00:03:47.460
- [Black Lou] Yeah, a few times.

00:03:47.460 --> 00:03:48.595
- A few times?

00:03:48.595 --> 00:03:50.463
Have you spoken on words yet?

00:03:50.463 --> 00:03:51.564
- On the phone?
- Yeah.

00:03:51.564 --> 00:03:53.032
- No, no, no, no.

00:03:53.032 --> 00:03:54.267
- This will be the first time
you're hearing her voice?

00:03:54.267 --> 00:03:55.235
- Yes.
- You went back and forth.

00:03:55.235 --> 00:03:56.202
(crosstalk)
- Jesus.

00:03:56.202 --> 00:03:57.270
- I feel like she's young.

00:03:57.270 --> 00:03:58.304
- [Black Lou] Ah, you know what?

00:03:58.304 --> 00:03:59.572
- I'll tell you why.

00:03:59.572 --> 00:04:00.807
- [Dan] She wearing a
school girl uniform?

00:04:00.807 --> 00:04:02.308
(group laughing)

00:04:02.308 --> 00:04:04.043
- Yeah, she's definitely
your possible foot soldier

00:04:04.043 --> 00:04:05.311
with (laughter drowns
out speaker) h.

00:04:05.311 --> 00:04:08.314
No but, every photo is
just a selfie of her.

00:04:08.314 --> 00:04:10.683
And everyone has on those
filters with the big fake eyes

00:04:10.683 --> 00:04:11.918
and all that stuff.
- Yeah, yeah.

00:04:11.918 --> 00:04:15.788
- It's a younger thing.
- Or Japanese culture.

00:04:15.788 --> 00:04:17.056
- [Jay] Yeah.

00:04:17.056 --> 00:04:18.291
- You're either in a
Japanese anime or...

00:04:18.291 --> 00:04:21.461
- Oh yeah, her mom is
Irish, her dad is Anime.

00:04:21.461 --> 00:04:22.729
(group laughing)

00:04:22.729 --> 00:04:24.797
- Her dad was actually,
he's half Dragon Ball Z.

00:04:24.797 --> 00:04:28.735
(group laughing)
(speaking Japanese)

00:04:28.735 --> 00:04:30.303
- So if you thought she
was a little bit exotic,

00:04:30.303 --> 00:04:32.739
it's probably the Japanime side.

00:04:35.008 --> 00:04:36.909
- Y'all just mad I'm cute, LOL.

00:04:36.909 --> 00:04:38.478
Bitches just hate me,
because they ain't me.

00:04:38.478 --> 00:04:40.013
- True that.

00:04:40.013 --> 00:04:40.847
- Christine, you have that
tattooed on your forearm?

00:04:40.847 --> 00:04:41.714
(Christine laughs)

00:04:41.714 --> 00:04:42.815
- You know, in Latin.

00:04:43.950 --> 00:04:45.618
- Autudious bitches
(group laughs).

00:04:47.153 --> 00:04:49.055
- 'Cause you ain'tes meus.

00:04:49.055 --> 00:04:50.356
- There you go, ain'tes meus.

00:04:50.356 --> 00:04:51.824
- Has she become virally
- She's 20.

00:04:51.824 --> 00:04:52.892
Has her identity been
revealed from that video,

00:04:52.892 --> 00:04:54.994
and she's gotten viral?

00:04:54.994 --> 00:04:56.763
- I think she's leaning in,
she's calling in to this show.

00:04:56.763 --> 00:04:58.431
So she has to be leaning
in at some point.

00:04:58.431 --> 00:05:00.066
Black Lou, you said
she's leaning into it?

00:05:00.066 --> 00:05:01.334
- Yeah.

00:05:01.334 --> 00:05:02.268
She told me, I don't
know how true it is,

00:05:02.268 --> 00:05:03.803
but she has been in LA all week.

00:05:03.803 --> 00:05:07.674
Last week she told me she was
going to LA to shoot Dr. Phil.

00:05:07.674 --> 00:05:09.175
So I wanted to get
with her before that.

00:05:09.175 --> 00:05:12.178
- Can we convince her that
Dr. Phil's on the show?

00:05:12.178 --> 00:05:14.414
Good to see you again Autumn.

00:05:14.414 --> 00:05:15.882
How are you?

00:05:15.882 --> 00:05:18.117
By the way, there's rumors,
I saw someone on Twitter

00:05:18.117 --> 00:05:20.653
said that Maggie got put down.

00:05:20.653 --> 00:05:22.055
I'm serious, look it up.

00:05:22.055 --> 00:05:22.989
- I saw that too.

00:05:22.989 --> 00:05:24.190
- Because if Maggie's dead,

00:05:24.190 --> 00:05:26.225
there has to be a
Chicago dets funeral.

00:05:26.225 --> 00:05:27.060
- A lot of filters.

00:05:27.060 --> 00:05:28.561
What it is right now,

00:05:28.561 --> 00:05:31.097
is that it's probably just
raining dick offers on her.

00:05:31.097 --> 00:05:32.799
- Oh my God, the first
question has to be,

00:05:32.799 --> 00:05:35.168
how many unsolicited
dick pic's did you get?

00:05:35.168 --> 00:05:38.271
- Well, she's just
like a normal civilian

00:05:38.271 --> 00:05:39.539
in the world, right?

00:05:39.539 --> 00:05:40.273
How many followers
does she have now?

00:05:40.273 --> 00:05:41.507
- 10.8 thousand.

00:05:41.507 --> 00:05:43.142
- That's a lot for
- That's this week.

00:05:43.142 --> 00:05:45.044
a girl in a place.

00:05:45.044 --> 00:05:48.114
- A girl in a place,
a girl in a place,

00:05:48.114 --> 00:05:49.382
she's in a tough place.

00:05:49.382 --> 00:05:50.683
I'm gonna write a
musical with her,

00:05:50.683 --> 00:05:52.385
called the summer of Autumn.

00:05:52.385 --> 00:05:54.487
(group laughs)
You guys dig it?

00:05:54.487 --> 00:05:56.622
It's about a man that
makes you fall in love

00:05:56.622 --> 00:05:58.191
and then you gotta trap him

00:05:58.191 --> 00:06:00.893
in an apartment
complex parking lot.

00:06:00.893 --> 00:06:03.096
Keying up his Nissan,
it is a Nissan.

00:06:03.096 --> 00:06:05.698
- Black Lou where are you
at with her in conversation?

00:06:05.698 --> 00:06:07.166
What's going on?

00:06:07.166 --> 00:06:09.135
She's calling in to defend
her case of why she did this?

00:06:09.135 --> 00:06:10.837
- Yeah, she wants to tell
her side of the story.

00:06:10.837 --> 00:06:12.071
- Absolutely.

00:06:12.071 --> 00:06:13.306
- I didn't want to
get into it to deep,

00:06:13.306 --> 00:06:14.507
I wanted to let
you guys do that.

00:06:14.507 --> 00:06:15.708
- So you feel that
she'll be forthcoming?

00:06:15.708 --> 00:06:18.077
I want to know, is that
her first keyed car?

00:06:18.077 --> 00:06:19.912
- Oh, probably.
- Yes, exactly.

00:06:19.912 --> 00:06:21.914
What's your technique,
is it a downward thing,

00:06:21.914 --> 00:06:23.416
or is it a up and down
kind of scratches?

00:06:23.416 --> 00:06:25.284
- I give the guy props
for not being like,

00:06:25.284 --> 00:06:28.087
I have to stop you
from keying my car.

00:06:28.087 --> 00:06:29.822
- No, doo, doo, doo,
doo, and grab her wrist.

00:06:29.822 --> 00:06:31.224
- That's hard to watch.

00:06:31.224 --> 00:06:33.393
- [Dan] It's a Nissan
too, watch the video.

00:06:34.961 --> 00:06:36.229
- Behind the scenes

00:06:36.229 --> 00:06:37.697
they're trying to figure
out the boyfriends race.

00:06:37.697 --> 00:06:39.165
- Yes, behind the scenes...
- Can we bet on that,

00:06:39.165 --> 00:06:40.299
because I really think
it's a great (crosstalk).

00:06:40.299 --> 00:06:41.501
- All right, let's do it,

00:06:41.501 --> 00:06:42.735
let's open up the
betting pool right now

00:06:42.735 --> 00:06:44.237
I say...
- Most of us are locked in

00:06:44.237 --> 00:06:45.505
with the same thing I think.

00:06:45.505 --> 00:06:46.706
- Hispanic?
- Yeah,

00:06:46.706 --> 00:06:48.107
I think this guys Hispanic.

00:06:48.107 --> 00:06:49.709
- Latino.
What do you think?

00:06:49.709 --> 00:06:51.110
- Oh, black and white mix.

00:06:51.110 --> 00:06:52.311
- [Dan] You think he's mixed?

00:06:52.311 --> 00:06:53.546
- Blake Griffin,
basketball player...

00:06:53.546 --> 00:06:54.714
- [Dan] Christine
what do you got?

00:06:54.714 --> 00:06:56.816
- He's Spanish.
- You think Hispanic.

00:06:56.816 --> 00:06:59.685
- DJ Lou?
(upbeat Spanish music)

00:06:59.685 --> 00:07:00.853
- Ahhh, see, see.

00:07:00.853 --> 00:07:02.355
Jacob, what do you think?
Jew?

00:07:02.355 --> 00:07:04.323
- Just to be different I'm
gonna say he's a black man.

00:07:04.323 --> 00:07:05.324
- Black man.
- Yeah.

00:07:05.324 --> 00:07:07.093
- Sal?
- From what I gleamed

00:07:07.093 --> 00:07:09.061
that one play, I
think Dominican.

00:07:09.061 --> 00:07:10.930
- Dominican, so you're
gonna go Hispanic?

00:07:10.930 --> 00:07:12.198
We're gonna go Latino.

00:07:12.198 --> 00:07:13.599
- Super Hispanic.
And where is she?

00:07:13.599 --> 00:07:15.368
She lives in LA?

00:07:15.368 --> 00:07:16.636
- She didn't say
where she lives,

00:07:16.636 --> 00:07:17.970
she just said she
was flying to LA.

00:07:17.970 --> 00:07:19.205
- But this is good.

00:07:19.205 --> 00:07:21.040
Good blind bet, because
if we knew the region,

00:07:21.040 --> 00:07:22.442
it would effect everything.

00:07:22.442 --> 00:07:24.477
- Can I change mine?
- Yes.

00:07:24.477 --> 00:07:25.478
- Because we didn't
find out anything.

00:07:25.478 --> 00:07:27.213
- Yeah.
- I'm gonna go Mexicano.

00:07:27.213 --> 00:07:29.649
- Mexicano, got it.

00:07:29.649 --> 00:07:31.884
I'm gonna go Polish.

00:07:32.752 --> 00:07:34.153
- I think we should have to go,

00:07:34.153 --> 00:07:36.055
if we're going
specific Hispanic,

00:07:36.055 --> 00:07:38.024
my answer would be
different than Dominican.

00:07:38.024 --> 00:07:39.625
I would go with Puerto Rican.

00:07:39.625 --> 00:07:42.361
- I was gonna go Colombiano.

00:07:42.361 --> 00:07:45.264
Colombiano, maybe Guatemalan

00:07:45.264 --> 00:07:46.666
(group laughs), he's Guatemalan.

00:07:46.666 --> 00:07:48.935
- That's a cool headed
Colombian, if he's Colombian.

00:07:48.935 --> 00:07:51.938
- He goes, "Bruh, you
gotta let me out bro.

00:07:51.938 --> 00:07:53.339
"You're assaulting me."

00:07:53.339 --> 00:07:55.341
He's this little Colombian,
a little Guatemalan.

00:07:55.341 --> 00:07:56.742
- I don't like you kidnapped me.

00:07:56.742 --> 00:07:59.679
- Peruvian, I'm going Peruvian,
I'm going South America.

00:07:59.679 --> 00:08:01.147
- Ecuadorian.
- Ecuadorian.

00:08:01.147 --> 00:08:02.048
- Just get shorter and shorter.

00:08:02.048 --> 00:08:03.282
- [Dan] No, no, no.

00:08:04.917 --> 00:08:06.185
You see a little arm.

00:08:06.185 --> 00:08:06.886
Stop it, stop it,
Stop it, stop it.

00:08:10.089 --> 00:08:12.325
That's not my car.
- Don't key my car.

00:08:12.325 --> 00:08:13.526
- Emadre say, no.

00:08:13.526 --> 00:08:15.261
- She keyed my car.

00:08:15.261 --> 00:08:17.663
- I would say, I'm actually,
Black Lou makes a good point.

00:08:17.663 --> 00:08:18.831
He might...

00:08:18.831 --> 00:08:19.765
- Can we play it one more time?

00:08:19.765 --> 00:08:21.033
- I'm changing mine.

00:08:21.033 --> 00:08:22.235
You know what, can we
play it one more time?

00:08:22.235 --> 00:08:23.469
Just one more time,
because I might change.

00:08:23.469 --> 00:08:24.871
I think I like the
black and white mix.

00:08:25.838 --> 00:08:27.273
I've lost my mind.

00:08:27.273 --> 00:08:29.909
- Scrape, she's
gonna work on it.

00:08:29.909 --> 00:08:31.377
- [Autumn] You think I care?

00:08:31.377 --> 00:08:32.712
- That's...
- I don't care anymore.

00:08:32.712 --> 00:08:34.814
- What's scary to me
is the (crosstalk).

00:08:34.814 --> 00:08:35.648
- Hold on.

00:08:36.983 --> 00:08:40.319
- [Autumn] (key scratching
car) give a fuck.

00:08:41.387 --> 00:08:42.321
Fuck.

00:08:42.321 --> 00:08:43.589
- You don't need to give a fuck.

00:08:43.589 --> 00:08:45.791
That's cool, I got video
proof of you doing this.

00:08:45.791 --> 00:08:47.293
You're crazy, bruh.

00:08:47.293 --> 00:08:49.295
- Yeah, I'm changing it, I
think he's black and white.

00:08:49.295 --> 00:08:51.731
I think he's mixed.

00:08:51.731 --> 00:08:53.900
I think he's a mixed black guy.

00:08:53.900 --> 00:08:56.269
- I'm gonna go crazy left field.

00:08:56.269 --> 00:08:57.403
- Okay.
- I'm gonna go

00:08:58.304 --> 00:08:59.906
an Asian with urban flare.

00:08:59.906 --> 00:09:02.708
- Oh, I love it.

00:09:02.708 --> 00:09:04.143
Did not think that.

00:09:04.143 --> 00:09:05.778
- Oh, you think this
girls getting dicked down

00:09:05.778 --> 00:09:06.846
by an Asian dude?

00:09:06.846 --> 00:09:08.814
- Oh.
- It is a Nissan.

00:09:08.814 --> 00:09:12.785
- Ooh, shit that's right.

00:09:12.785 --> 00:09:14.353
- It was weird that
we almost sunk up.

00:09:14.353 --> 00:09:15.888
They went, "Aah",

00:09:15.888 --> 00:09:19.725
and Jacob was moving his head
to the left and he goes, "Oh."

00:09:19.725 --> 00:09:21.227
Meow.

00:09:21.227 --> 00:09:23.930
- On the phone line, very
excited to have her on.

00:09:23.930 --> 00:09:26.065
We prepped you a little bit
before the break on the story.

00:09:26.065 --> 00:09:28.568
So intrigued now
to hear the story.

00:09:28.568 --> 00:09:29.802
- A lot of questions,

00:09:29.802 --> 00:09:31.804
but also we know a
lot of perspectives

00:09:31.804 --> 00:09:33.339
that we haven't heard.

00:09:33.339 --> 00:09:36.509
- Well, and I'm saying it's
something upon watching it,

00:09:36.509 --> 00:09:40.346
it's black or white,
everyone is either behind her

00:09:40.346 --> 00:09:42.848
or going ugh crazy brod.

00:09:42.848 --> 00:09:46.786
So we'd love to have her
here, on the line here,

00:09:46.786 --> 00:09:48.688
to explain the story.

00:09:48.688 --> 00:09:49.755
And we'll get to know
her a little bit.

00:09:49.755 --> 00:09:52.124
Everyone, Autumn Rowe.

00:09:52.124 --> 00:09:55.194
Autumn you there?
- Yeah, I'm still here.

00:09:55.194 --> 00:09:57.530
How are you?
Thank you for being on hold

00:09:57.530 --> 00:09:58.864
there for us, I know.

00:09:58.864 --> 00:10:01.067
Sorry, Michael
McDonald was singing.

00:10:01.067 --> 00:10:02.335
Everyone in the
room got caught up.

00:10:02.335 --> 00:10:04.103
- You know, we tried
to turn on the mics

00:10:04.103 --> 00:10:05.371
they wouldn't turn on.

00:10:05.371 --> 00:10:07.406
They wanted us to hear
more Michael McDonald.

00:10:07.406 --> 00:10:10.109
- Your video Autumn,
a viral sensation.

00:10:11.510 --> 00:10:14.313
Worldstar Hip Hop, I still have
a dream of having something

00:10:14.313 --> 00:10:17.049
of mine, I can't in
the world get a video

00:10:17.049 --> 00:10:18.551
on Worldstar Hip Hop.

00:10:18.551 --> 00:10:20.386
But you made the cut,
which was awesome.

00:10:20.386 --> 00:10:24.490
I don't know if you're loving
the attention, not liking it.

00:10:24.490 --> 00:10:25.391
Fill us in.

00:10:26.492 --> 00:10:28.828
[Autumn] Well, at first
I really hated it.

00:10:28.828 --> 00:10:31.664
But honestly I don't
really care anymore.

00:10:31.664 --> 00:10:35.101
Peoples opinions of me, they
just don't bother me anymore.

00:10:35.101 --> 00:10:36.769
- Okay, when it happened...

00:10:36.769 --> 00:10:38.437
[Autumn] I've got a lot
of negative hate from it,

00:10:38.437 --> 00:10:41.140
but I've also had a lot
of positive reactions

00:10:41.140 --> 00:10:42.942
from a lot of women
reaching out to me,

00:10:42.942 --> 00:10:45.411
that have been
through similar things

00:10:45.411 --> 00:10:46.679
that I've been through.

00:10:46.679 --> 00:10:47.980
- So that brings us to
one of the questions

00:10:47.980 --> 00:10:49.215
that we were wondering.

00:10:49.215 --> 00:10:52.051
Because our producer
Lou, Black Lou,

00:10:52.051 --> 00:10:54.453
LJ as Sean Fury calls him.

00:10:54.453 --> 00:10:56.489
Said that he knows a
lot of these stories

00:10:56.489 --> 00:11:00.359
and the dudes always do
something crazy to merit this.

00:11:00.359 --> 00:11:04.196
And all you got was the reaction
shot of you keying up his,

00:11:04.196 --> 00:11:06.499
and let me guess this
properly, Nissan Maxima?

00:11:07.800 --> 00:11:09.502
[Autumn] Yes, it was
actually a rental car, but...

00:11:09.502 --> 00:11:11.537
- Oh.
- Enterprise, I told you.

00:11:11.537 --> 00:11:12.938
Did he rent from Enterprise?

00:11:13.839 --> 00:11:14.974
[Autumn] Um, I think so.

00:11:14.974 --> 00:11:15.875
- Yeah, awe man.

00:11:15.875 --> 00:11:17.643
- Man, Dan nailed that.

00:11:17.643 --> 00:11:19.311
- First off Autumn,
thank you for confirming

00:11:19.311 --> 00:11:20.479
what I already knew,

00:11:20.479 --> 00:11:21.881
which is that Enterprise
has the best deal

00:11:21.881 --> 00:11:23.649
on Nissan's day to day.

00:11:23.649 --> 00:11:25.484
Also, Autumn, second question.

00:11:25.484 --> 00:11:28.087
We have a bet going on the show

00:11:28.087 --> 00:11:30.022
because we don't see his face.

00:11:30.022 --> 00:11:33.059
We just heard...
Is this your ex-boyfriend?

00:11:33.059 --> 00:11:34.026
I don't know what to call him.

00:11:34.026 --> 00:11:35.227
What do we call him, your ex?

00:11:35.227 --> 00:11:36.996
[Autumn] Yes, he
was my ex-boyfriend.

00:11:36.996 --> 00:11:38.497
We dated for about two years.

00:11:38.497 --> 00:11:40.933
- All right, so he's your
boyfriend of two years.

00:11:40.933 --> 00:11:45.104
And we had a guess,
there are seven of us.

00:11:45.104 --> 00:11:48.040
And we all guessed
what ethnicity he was.

00:11:48.040 --> 00:11:50.476
He used bruh, he used...

00:11:50.476 --> 00:11:52.378
We were trying to guess
from the way he talked,

00:11:52.378 --> 00:11:54.413
what was your ex-boyfriend?

00:11:56.449 --> 00:11:59.385
- He was white and black.
(group yells Ahhh in unison)

00:11:59.385 --> 00:12:01.620
- Shit.
- Let's go baby.

00:12:03.122 --> 00:12:05.124
- I pulled it because of you.
- (crosstalk) or what?

00:12:05.124 --> 00:12:06.392
- Bruh.

00:12:06.392 --> 00:12:08.961
- Our one and only black
staff member called it.

00:12:08.961 --> 00:12:12.998
- Yeah, which means we
are ignorant pink racists.

00:12:12.998 --> 00:12:14.567
[Autumn] What was
everyone guessing?

00:12:14.567 --> 00:12:16.736
- We had a couple Dominican's,

00:12:16.736 --> 00:12:20.172
we had an Urban
Asian guess from Sal.

00:12:20.172 --> 00:12:23.242
- Yeah, my guess was, I
thought I heard him going

00:12:23.242 --> 00:12:25.778
when he said, "You're
kidnapping me.

00:12:25.778 --> 00:12:27.446
"You're kidnapping me, Bro."

00:12:27.446 --> 00:12:29.515
sounded very Cholo to me.

00:12:29.515 --> 00:12:32.084
- Yeah, no, you
thought it was some...

00:12:32.084 --> 00:12:32.918
- I'm an idiot.

00:12:34.353 --> 00:12:35.821
Would you mind, Autumn, at all,

00:12:35.821 --> 00:12:37.923
telling the story that
led up to this moment,

00:12:37.923 --> 00:12:40.826
because it really is the
only context of it is,

00:12:40.826 --> 00:12:44.130
girl loosing her shit, but
there's gotta be a reason.

00:12:45.231 --> 00:12:46.732
[Autumn] That was his point,

00:12:46.732 --> 00:12:48.400
it was his point to make
me look like I was crazy,

00:12:48.400 --> 00:12:50.970
that's what he wanted
to gain from this video.

00:12:50.970 --> 00:12:52.605
Looks like he gained that.

00:12:52.605 --> 00:12:54.974
- Yeah, so what happened?

00:12:54.974 --> 00:12:56.776
What led to this moment?

00:12:58.177 --> 00:12:59.879
[Autumn] So, actually
before the video was taken,

00:12:59.879 --> 00:13:01.313
you only see his side really.

00:13:01.313 --> 00:13:04.416
So before the video was taken,
we were at my apartment,

00:13:04.416 --> 00:13:07.086
where he assaulted me,
put his hands on me,

00:13:07.086 --> 00:13:08.888
like he does all the time.

00:13:08.888 --> 00:13:10.422
We had a lot of
domestic problems

00:13:10.422 --> 00:13:12.925
throughout our
relationship of two years.

00:13:12.925 --> 00:13:15.861
So we're at my apartment
and he assaulted me

00:13:15.861 --> 00:13:17.329
and stole my cell phone.

00:13:17.329 --> 00:13:20.099
And I had already paid to
fix my phone about four times

00:13:20.099 --> 00:13:21.801
that month and I had
to buy a new phone

00:13:21.801 --> 00:13:23.302
because he broke
the last one so bad.

00:13:23.302 --> 00:13:26.172
So I was pretty angry
that he took my phone.

00:13:26.172 --> 00:13:28.641
So I got, my car wasn't
there at the time,

00:13:28.641 --> 00:13:30.309
he had dropped me
off at my house.

00:13:30.309 --> 00:13:32.311
So I got an Uber to my car

00:13:32.311 --> 00:13:34.547
and I was just chilling
in my car, rolling up,

00:13:34.547 --> 00:13:37.883
just about to chill, take my
mind off what just happened

00:13:37.883 --> 00:13:40.920
and he pulled up behind
my car at Chick-fil-A,

00:13:40.920 --> 00:13:42.054
blocks my car in.

00:13:43.489 --> 00:13:47.259
He starts beaming through
there, recording me.

00:13:47.259 --> 00:13:48.761
Trying to antagonize me.

00:13:48.761 --> 00:13:50.095
- So you were in
the parking lot?

00:13:50.095 --> 00:13:52.097
And again, you...
- We have to say...

00:13:52.097 --> 00:13:56.035
- We have to legally say,
he allegedly assaulted you,

00:13:56.035 --> 00:13:59.705
because we can't be legally
put on the line for this.

00:13:59.705 --> 00:14:02.508
But you're saying he
allegedly assaulted you

00:14:02.508 --> 00:14:04.376
and then this was
later in the day.

00:14:04.376 --> 00:14:05.711
You were just in the parking lot

00:14:05.711 --> 00:14:07.479
and then this is
when he pulled up?

00:14:08.814 --> 00:14:10.282
[Autumn] No, this is
exactly, this is like, okay.

00:14:10.282 --> 00:14:12.151
So right when that happened,
I got an Uber to my car.

00:14:12.151 --> 00:14:14.987
So this is all within an
hour and a half time span.

00:14:14.987 --> 00:14:17.556
- Okay, so you guys are
fighting, you leave,

00:14:17.556 --> 00:14:20.893
you take an Uber to your car.

00:14:20.893 --> 00:14:22.261
[Autumn] Yes.

00:14:22.261 --> 00:14:24.730
And he blocks my car in there.

00:14:24.730 --> 00:14:27.299
- But his Maxima is
in the parking lot

00:14:27.299 --> 00:14:29.335
and your car is blocking him in.

00:14:29.335 --> 00:14:32.638
- Yeah.
- So how did you get to there?

00:14:32.638 --> 00:14:34.940
If you were parked and
then he blocked you in?

00:14:36.108 --> 00:14:37.576
[Autumn] So because we
were at Chick-fil-A,

00:14:37.576 --> 00:14:40.112
he has my car blocked, I drive
over the curb to get out,

00:14:40.112 --> 00:14:42.281
- Chick-fil-A.
- He starts driving off

00:14:42.281 --> 00:14:44.550
and I'm like, you know
what, I want my phone back,

00:14:44.550 --> 00:14:46.719
and this dude has made
me pay so much money

00:14:46.719 --> 00:14:48.654
between punching
holes in my wall,

00:14:48.654 --> 00:14:50.589
allegedly punching
holes in my wall.

00:14:50.589 --> 00:14:53.092
- Oh no, you can claim the
actual assault on the wall.

00:14:53.092 --> 00:14:54.827
We're just worried about,
we don't think the wall

00:14:54.827 --> 00:14:56.061
will sue Sirius.

00:14:56.061 --> 00:14:57.897
- You can attack,
walls are fruit.

00:14:57.897 --> 00:15:00.966
- Drywall doesn't have
access to legal council.

00:15:02.668 --> 00:15:04.169
So, he would punch
holes in walls.

00:15:04.169 --> 00:15:06.739
Also, I just want to say,
as a video game player,

00:15:06.739 --> 00:15:08.874
that can be a cause
of it as well.

00:15:08.874 --> 00:15:10.576
So he cost you so much money

00:15:10.576 --> 00:15:13.045
that you go stop
him from leaving?

00:15:13.045 --> 00:15:15.614
- [Autumn] Yeah, well,
yeah, I go to and I'm like,

00:15:15.614 --> 00:15:17.750
you know what, I'm gonna
make him pay for money.

00:15:17.750 --> 00:15:19.218
He starts recording me
like he always does.

00:15:19.218 --> 00:15:20.753
I'm like, you wanna record
me, I'm gonna give you a show.

00:15:20.753 --> 00:15:22.888
And that's why I'm kind
of smiling in the video.

00:15:22.888 --> 00:15:24.757
I was like, I'm tired
of you making me pay

00:15:24.757 --> 00:15:26.792
for all of this stuff, it's
your turn to pay for something,

00:15:26.792 --> 00:15:27.626
I'm gonna key your car.

00:15:27.626 --> 00:15:29.528
So I keyed his car.

00:15:29.528 --> 00:15:31.030
- So it wasn't even cheating.

00:15:31.030 --> 00:15:32.665
I think we all just assumed
it was gonna be cheating.

00:15:32.665 --> 00:15:34.199
- We thought it was cheating.
- No, no, no,

00:15:34.199 --> 00:15:36.135
it has nothing to do with him
dumping me or cheating on me.

00:15:36.135 --> 00:15:37.569
He drove to my house
right after that

00:15:37.569 --> 00:15:39.138
and tried his best
to get me back.

00:15:39.138 --> 00:15:41.607
He was begging me,
saying he was so sorry.

00:15:41.607 --> 00:15:43.342
He definitely did
not cheat on me,

00:15:43.342 --> 00:15:44.810
definitely did not
break up with me.

00:15:44.810 --> 00:15:46.278
- Also, do you have
any more money?

00:15:46.278 --> 00:15:47.579
- [Autumn] That is not
what happened, whatsoever.

00:15:47.579 --> 00:15:49.648
- Why did he have a rental?
Fender bender?

00:15:51.083 --> 00:15:53.085
- [Autumn] Oh yeah, he had
gotten into a fender bender

00:15:53.085 --> 00:15:55.020
like a week or two before.
- Nailed it.

00:15:55.020 --> 00:15:56.221
- Ugh, Sal.

00:15:56.221 --> 00:15:57.756
- So keying the rental
car actually isn't

00:15:57.756 --> 00:16:00.092
that big a deal because it's
going back to insurance.

00:16:00.092 --> 00:16:01.393
Did he buy the insurance?

00:16:02.528 --> 00:16:04.063
- [Autumn] Honestly,
I have no idea,

00:16:04.063 --> 00:16:05.631
I just know that I didn't
have to pay for anything.

00:16:05.631 --> 00:16:07.032
- I guess, the question
I'm asking you is,

00:16:07.032 --> 00:16:09.702
is he more half
white or half black?

00:16:09.702 --> 00:16:13.072
(group laughs)

00:16:13.072 --> 00:16:15.674
- [Autumn] I'm not
really, for sure.

00:16:15.674 --> 00:16:18.477
He's just equal, half
white and half black.

00:16:18.477 --> 00:16:20.746
- Now what has been your
dealings with him since?

00:16:22.648 --> 00:16:24.583
- [Autumn] This video
was taken in May.

00:16:25.751 --> 00:16:28.287
So I broke up with him
about two weeks ago

00:16:28.287 --> 00:16:30.289
and then that's when he
sent the video around.

00:16:30.289 --> 00:16:31.690
And that's how it got posted.

00:16:31.690 --> 00:16:34.426
- Oh, you stayed together
after this night?

00:16:36.095 --> 00:16:39.231
- [Autumn] After this night,
yeah, we did get back together.

00:16:39.231 --> 00:16:41.000
- I don't know if you did,

00:16:41.000 --> 00:16:42.534
but I bet if you guys
hooked up that night,

00:16:42.534 --> 00:16:45.671
I bet it was intense.
- Crazy.

00:16:45.671 --> 00:16:46.905
Were you guys doing the thing

00:16:46.905 --> 00:16:48.474
where you're almost
biting each other?

00:16:50.709 --> 00:16:52.711
- Like kissy face punches.

00:16:52.711 --> 00:16:55.247
- Like muah, haa haa, muah.

00:16:56.448 --> 00:16:58.851
So you guys, I'm sorry I
wasn't paying attention.

00:16:58.851 --> 00:17:00.085
You guys got back together?

00:17:00.085 --> 00:17:01.587
I was laughing about
your joke, sorry.

00:17:01.587 --> 00:17:04.656
The half white, half black
thing fucking killed me.

00:17:04.656 --> 00:17:06.725
You guys aren't back together

00:17:06.725 --> 00:17:08.994
or have not been back together?

00:17:08.994 --> 00:17:10.696
- [Autumn] No, we broke
up about, like I said,

00:17:10.696 --> 00:17:12.231
about two weeks ago and
that's when the video

00:17:12.231 --> 00:17:13.899
went viral, is because
I broke up with him,

00:17:13.899 --> 00:17:16.035
so he sent it
around to everybody.

00:17:16.035 --> 00:17:17.369
- Oh, shit, so you guys
had made up after this

00:17:17.369 --> 00:17:19.238
and then he put it viral.

00:17:19.238 --> 00:17:20.773
And you haven't spoke to him

00:17:20.773 --> 00:17:22.741
since the video
went viral, right?

00:17:22.741 --> 00:17:24.676
- [Autumn] I'm
actually in Los Angeles

00:17:24.676 --> 00:17:26.645
and we're about to go
on the Dr. Phil show.

00:17:26.645 --> 00:17:30.182
- Well what if I told you that
Dr. Phil was here right now?

00:17:30.182 --> 00:17:31.617
- You're going on Dr.
Phil with the guy?

00:17:31.617 --> 00:17:33.819
- You're going on right,
have you filmed it yet?

00:17:34.820 --> 00:17:36.221
- [Autumn] We're
filming tomorrow

00:17:36.221 --> 00:17:37.523
and whoever did an
impersonation of Dr. Phil,

00:17:37.523 --> 00:17:39.191
that was trash.

00:17:39.191 --> 00:17:40.659
That was not a
good impersonation.

00:17:40.659 --> 00:17:42.795
- I'll fight you, I'll fight
you, I'll key your car,

00:17:42.795 --> 00:17:44.129
I don't even car
if it's a rental.

00:17:44.129 --> 00:17:45.697
- I will key your car.
- Bring it.

00:17:45.697 --> 00:17:47.099
- That's my favorite
thing I've ever heard.

00:17:47.099 --> 00:17:49.902
- [Dan] I'll fight
you in a parking lot.

00:17:49.902 --> 00:17:51.437
- (crosstalk) it was trash.

00:17:51.437 --> 00:17:54.306
- What's odd is that it's
such a good impersonation.

00:17:54.306 --> 00:17:55.908
- I don't know why she's
such a Dr. Phil fan,

00:17:55.908 --> 00:17:58.844
she can't shit on
a guy a little bit.

00:17:58.844 --> 00:18:00.446
- Oh shit.

00:18:00.446 --> 00:18:03.248
- Are you going on
with the ex-boyfriend?

00:18:03.248 --> 00:18:05.751
- [Autumn] Yes, and I'm
telling my side of the story.

00:18:05.751 --> 00:18:07.219
- Oh, all right.
- And I have proof

00:18:07.219 --> 00:18:08.487
to back everything that
I've been through up.

00:18:08.487 --> 00:18:09.755
- So you're gonna
be there with him,

00:18:09.755 --> 00:18:13.459
it's not like you guys
are going on together.

00:18:13.459 --> 00:18:15.427
You're going there
as adversaries?

00:18:16.595 --> 00:18:18.063
- [Autumn] We have to
go on at different times

00:18:18.063 --> 00:18:19.965
because I have a restraining
order against him.

00:18:19.965 --> 00:18:22.468
- No shit.
So it's serious.

00:18:22.468 --> 00:18:23.902
Dr. Phil you know he dives in.

00:18:23.902 --> 00:18:25.104
- [Autumn] Yeah,
he's been to jail.

00:18:25.104 --> 00:18:26.371
Yeah, he's been to
jail for this already.

00:18:26.371 --> 00:18:29.675
- Oh, so he went
to jail for this,

00:18:29.675 --> 00:18:30.509
not for this video,

00:18:30.509 --> 00:18:32.211
but for other assaults?

00:18:32.211 --> 00:18:34.947
Which if he has been
convicted are legal assaults

00:18:34.947 --> 00:18:36.615
and we can't get sued for that,

00:18:36.615 --> 00:18:37.850
so we don't have
to say allegedly.

00:18:37.850 --> 00:18:38.884
- [Autumn] Yes, he got
aggravated assault.

00:18:38.884 --> 00:18:40.486
- Oh, shit.
- I'll tell you

00:18:40.486 --> 00:18:42.588
after this Dr, Phil appearance,

00:18:42.588 --> 00:18:46.458
if you have any
lyrics inside of you

00:18:46.458 --> 00:18:48.560
that you can drop
a few rap bars,

00:18:48.560 --> 00:18:50.529
you will get looked at for
at least a record deal.

00:18:50.529 --> 00:18:52.331
- Dr. Phil is a king maker.

00:18:52.331 --> 00:18:54.032
- Really?
- I've heard.

00:18:55.501 --> 00:18:57.703
- And I'm gonna watch Dr.
Phil to fucking nail down

00:18:57.703 --> 00:19:00.606
this impression because
apparently it's trash.

00:19:00.606 --> 00:19:01.607
You mean woman.

00:19:01.607 --> 00:19:02.875
- Yeah, you need
to work on that.

00:19:02.875 --> 00:19:04.209
- You work on it.

00:19:04.209 --> 00:19:06.712
(group laughs)

00:19:06.712 --> 00:19:09.014
I'm just getting all pissed off.

00:19:09.014 --> 00:19:10.482
- Now you're gonna
get in a fight

00:19:10.482 --> 00:19:12.451
and get the Dan going,
hey you're kidnapping me,

00:19:12.451 --> 00:19:13.819
you're kidnapping me.

00:19:13.819 --> 00:19:14.753
- Hey, yeah.

00:19:14.753 --> 00:19:15.554
She goes, do you think I care?

00:19:15.554 --> 00:19:17.022
I go, this is a...

00:19:17.022 --> 00:19:18.190
- [Autumn] What you can't
see is the other side

00:19:18.190 --> 00:19:19.958
of the hotel, he
could have driven out.

00:19:19.958 --> 00:19:21.126
I wasn't even blocking him in.

00:19:21.126 --> 00:19:22.528
- It doesn't even
matter, I'm surprised...

00:19:22.528 --> 00:19:24.062
- The part that made
us laugh the hardest

00:19:24.062 --> 00:19:26.565
was when your ex-boyfriend
goes, "You're kidnapping me.

00:19:26.565 --> 00:19:28.367
"You're kidnapping me."

00:19:28.367 --> 00:19:29.668
- [Autumn] Yeah, he is a joke.

00:19:29.668 --> 00:19:30.602
He is the whole joke.

00:19:30.602 --> 00:19:31.803
- That's what I'm saying,

00:19:31.803 --> 00:19:33.038
I'm surprised you
got back with the guy

00:19:33.038 --> 00:19:35.674
and gained a chance
for sexual attraction

00:19:35.674 --> 00:19:39.011
to a guy who yelled, you're
kidnapping me, to you.

00:19:39.011 --> 00:19:41.880
That seems like such a weird
thing to get past, you know.

00:19:41.880 --> 00:19:43.382
- Yeah, yeah.

00:19:43.382 --> 00:19:46.351
- Hey, Autumn, Black Lou,
our producer has a question.

00:19:47.419 --> 00:19:50.122
- Is the ex a
athlete of some sort?

00:19:50.122 --> 00:19:52.791
Because he seems very
tall from the video.

00:19:52.791 --> 00:19:54.293
- [Autumn] He's pretty tall,
but no he's not an athlete.

00:19:54.293 --> 00:19:55.794
- He didn't play ball at all?

00:19:55.794 --> 00:19:59.164
- [Autumn] He used to, but no,
he doesn't play basketball.

00:19:59.164 --> 00:20:00.699
- Black Lou's going
for the trifecta.

00:20:00.699 --> 00:20:02.868
Christine, we have
Christine on the show here.

00:20:02.868 --> 00:20:07.072
Same scenario she describes,
do you key up a car?

00:20:10.175 --> 00:20:13.278
- [Christine] I don't know,
I'm not a very physical person.

00:20:13.278 --> 00:20:14.513
- Did you have a
thing with a guy

00:20:14.513 --> 00:20:15.781
where you paid for everything

00:20:15.781 --> 00:20:17.349
and got taken
advantage of like that?

00:20:17.349 --> 00:20:19.318
- No.
- Just me?

00:20:19.318 --> 00:20:21.153
- [Dan] Autumn, how
did you two meet?

00:20:22.321 --> 00:20:23.355
- [Autumn] How did we meet?

00:20:23.355 --> 00:20:25.524
We actually met on Instagram.

00:20:25.524 --> 00:20:27.192
- Okay.
- Really.

00:20:27.192 --> 00:20:29.461
- [Autumn] He slid in
the DM's, you know.

00:20:29.461 --> 00:20:31.430
- He just reached out.

00:20:31.430 --> 00:20:33.298
- [Autumn] Yep,
he slid in the DM.

00:20:33.298 --> 00:20:35.667
- Black Lou.
- How many kids does he have?

00:20:36.802 --> 00:20:38.370
- He has one kid.
- Boom.

00:20:38.370 --> 00:20:41.039
- [Jay] Man, Black
Lou's on it, God.

00:20:42.574 --> 00:20:45.077
- He walks back in and goes
I got one more question.

00:20:45.077 --> 00:20:46.645
He's like Columbo.

00:20:46.645 --> 00:20:50.482
You said that the car was
borrowed from Enterprise.

00:20:50.482 --> 00:20:52.351
Well, I know if
you're renting a car

00:20:52.351 --> 00:20:54.119
you gotta get insurance on it.

00:20:54.119 --> 00:20:55.087
Is that a trash Columbo?

00:20:55.087 --> 00:20:56.588
Come at me.

00:20:56.588 --> 00:20:59.324
- You think there's a
chance that his kids mom.

00:20:59.324 --> 00:21:00.525
Have you and the kids mom

00:21:00.525 --> 00:21:02.327
had beef before
over the two years?

00:21:03.495 --> 00:21:05.464
- [Autumn] No, I'm
a mature adult,

00:21:05.464 --> 00:21:07.466
I didn't really pay
attention to ex-girlfriends.

00:21:07.466 --> 00:21:09.067
But I've never met her.

00:21:09.067 --> 00:21:10.002
- [Dan] No, but what I'm
saying is that some times

00:21:10.002 --> 00:21:10.936
they come at you.

00:21:10.936 --> 00:21:12.471
She might have come at you.

00:21:12.471 --> 00:21:15.007
- Yeah, so there's been no
drama with the baby mama?

00:21:15.007 --> 00:21:16.908
- Nope.
- Damn.

00:21:16.908 --> 00:21:18.610
- Well that's good at least.

00:21:18.610 --> 00:21:20.545
I'm so excited to watch the
episode of Dr. Phil now.

00:21:20.545 --> 00:21:22.814
I wanna see him, so bad.

00:21:22.814 --> 00:21:25.517
- Do you feel like you
still have feelings for him?

00:21:25.517 --> 00:21:27.152
Or you feel like you've
had the last straw,

00:21:27.152 --> 00:21:28.420
you're completely over him?

00:21:28.420 --> 00:21:31.223
There's no chance of you
ever reconsidering him?

00:21:32.691 --> 00:21:35.727
- No.
- No chance?

00:21:35.727 --> 00:21:39.264
- [Autumn] No chance, I have
bettered my life and moved on.

00:21:39.264 --> 00:21:40.365
- [Dan] All right,
well that's good.

00:21:40.365 --> 00:21:42.167
- What if he
proposes on Dr. Phil?

00:21:42.167 --> 00:21:44.903
- That's a weird left hand,
try to flip it around.

00:21:44.903 --> 00:21:48.006
- Well Black Lou will tell
you, on our squad here.

00:21:48.006 --> 00:21:52.678
Black Lou is Team Autumn
all the way, 100%.

00:21:52.678 --> 00:21:55.113
So if you need somebody
to call on Dr. Phil

00:21:55.113 --> 00:22:00.085
and give a shining testimony,
it's gonna be Black Lou.

00:22:01.486 --> 00:22:03.021
- He's had your back since
we watched the video.

00:22:03.021 --> 00:22:05.123
He didn't doubt you from the
second we watched the video.

00:22:05.123 --> 00:22:07.926
- Black Lou said, "That dude
did some fucked up shit.

00:22:07.926 --> 00:22:09.895
- Yeah, that's
exactly what he said.

00:22:09.895 --> 00:22:12.464
- [Jacob] I'm with
Lou, she's won me over.

00:22:12.464 --> 00:22:15.000
- Then he'd be correct.
- She's won you over too.

00:22:15.000 --> 00:22:16.168
You won Jacob over.

00:22:16.168 --> 00:22:17.369
- Autumn love hard.

00:22:17.369 --> 00:22:18.470
- She does love hard.

00:22:19.671 --> 00:22:22.107
Autumn, could I interest
you in a radio producer

00:22:22.107 --> 00:22:23.308
named Jacob Battat.

00:22:23.308 --> 00:22:25.077
You're single now,
this guy will not do,

00:22:25.077 --> 00:22:28.013
he's got his own cashola, Jacob.

00:22:28.013 --> 00:22:31.049
How do you feel
about maritime law?

00:22:31.049 --> 00:22:32.718
- [Autumn] How do
I feel about what?

00:22:32.718 --> 00:22:34.786
- Maritime law, it's sea law.

00:22:34.786 --> 00:22:36.521
- Just the ocean laws.

00:22:38.223 --> 00:22:40.359
- The ocean laws?
- Yeah.

00:22:40.359 --> 00:22:41.593
How do you feel
about shipwrecked?

00:22:41.593 --> 00:22:43.095
- It's not your fault
you don't know this.

00:22:43.095 --> 00:22:44.996
- Maritime laws, it's
a different set of laws

00:22:44.996 --> 00:22:46.765
and standards from
other sovereign nations

00:22:46.765 --> 00:22:49.601
or any other
international bodies.

00:22:49.601 --> 00:22:51.970
Let's get to the nuts
and bolts of this thing.

00:22:51.970 --> 00:22:53.572
How do you feel
about shipwrecks?

00:22:55.640 --> 00:22:57.142
- [Autumn] How do I
feel about shipwrecks?

00:22:57.142 --> 00:22:59.978
- Are you a Titanic fan?
- Never been on a ship.

00:22:59.978 --> 00:23:01.213
- Really?

00:23:01.213 --> 00:23:02.381
- [Autumn] I've never
watched the Titanic.

00:23:02.381 --> 00:23:03.648
- You've never
watched the Titanic?

00:23:03.648 --> 00:23:04.649
- [Jay] That's gonna be
a deal breaker for sure.

00:23:04.649 --> 00:23:06.118
- This isn't gonna work.
- Yeah.

00:23:06.118 --> 00:23:08.220
- But you know, Jacob,
you can show her Titanic.

00:23:08.220 --> 00:23:11.123
How old are you Autumn,
if you mind me asking?

00:23:11.123 --> 00:23:12.691
- I'm 20.
- 20 years old.

00:23:12.691 --> 00:23:14.926
- Do you know
about boats at all?

00:23:14.926 --> 00:23:16.194
- [Dan] Do you know
anything about boats at all?

00:23:16.194 --> 00:23:17.429
- No, I wouldn't
either at that age.

00:23:17.429 --> 00:23:18.363
- [Autumn] Do I know
anything about books?

00:23:18.363 --> 00:23:19.431
Yes, I've read a lot of books.

00:23:19.431 --> 00:23:21.400
- No, no, no, boats.
- Boats,

00:23:21.400 --> 00:23:22.834
the things that
float in the ocean.

00:23:22.834 --> 00:23:26.171
- [Autumn] Oh, boats, no I
don't know anything about boats.

00:23:26.171 --> 00:23:28.874
I've never been on
a ship or anything.

00:23:28.874 --> 00:23:31.042
- We were hoping to
hook you up with Jacob.

00:23:31.042 --> 00:23:32.611
- [Jacob] She was born
after the movie came out.

00:23:32.611 --> 00:23:34.012
- That is crazy.

00:23:34.012 --> 00:23:35.247
- Ah, that's gonna freak
you out a lot Jacob.

00:23:35.247 --> 00:23:37.382
- Well, Autumn good
luck on Dr. Phil.

00:23:37.382 --> 00:23:38.817
- Yeah, have a great show.

00:23:38.817 --> 00:23:42.287
I hope your point
gets out there.

00:23:42.287 --> 00:23:44.589
You make this guy look like
an ass hole that he is.

00:23:44.589 --> 00:23:46.324
Right Black Lou?
- Yep.

00:23:46.324 --> 00:23:47.559
- Yes indeed.

00:23:47.559 --> 00:23:49.561
Thank you so much
for calling us.

00:23:51.062 --> 00:23:54.733
We'll be right back after this.

00:23:54.733 --> 00:23:56.034
It's The Bonfire.

00:23:56.034 --> 00:23:58.170
- She got real 20 year
old girl at the end.

00:23:58.170 --> 00:24:00.539
Where she didn't
understand the references.

00:24:00.539 --> 00:24:02.874
You know, it's like when
you're confused you get angry.

00:24:02.874 --> 00:24:03.708
She started thrashing.

00:24:03.708 --> 00:24:04.910
- I almost got keyed.

00:24:04.910 --> 00:24:07.546
- Dude, no she tried
to come for you.

00:24:07.546 --> 00:24:09.614
- I mean that girl
on Instagram is hot.

00:24:09.614 --> 00:24:10.949
- Yep.
- Pretty hot chick.

00:24:10.949 --> 00:24:13.151
You now, but definitely hot.

00:24:13.151 --> 00:24:14.886
- 20, you guys were right,
the Columbo impression

00:24:14.886 --> 00:24:18.056
probably flew clear
over her head.

00:24:18.056 --> 00:24:20.325
Like enough fucking air space

00:24:20.325 --> 00:24:22.227
for it to be cleared for flight.

00:24:22.227 --> 00:24:24.796
- Your Dr. Phil
impression is garbage.

00:24:24.796 --> 00:24:26.698
- Oh my God, you're
Dr. Phil, you suck.

00:24:26.698 --> 00:24:28.867
- Sal, thank you so much
for hanging out with us man.

00:24:28.867 --> 00:24:30.068
- Thank you guys for having me.

00:24:30.068 --> 00:24:31.002
- Did you have fun?

00:24:31.002 --> 00:24:32.404
- Always, always blessed.

00:24:32.404 --> 00:24:34.873
- You got to meet your
future, lunatic ex-girlfriend,

00:24:34.873 --> 00:24:36.308
Autumn Rowe.

00:24:36.308 --> 00:24:38.310
Which I guess you can
catch coming up soon

00:24:38.310 --> 00:24:39.611
on Dr. Phil.

00:24:39.611 --> 00:24:41.813
- But don't worry...
- The real Dr. Phil,

00:24:41.813 --> 00:24:43.181
not that hunk of shit
impression we get

00:24:43.181 --> 00:24:44.983
in this bullshit ass studio.

00:24:46.117 --> 00:24:47.586
- [Sal] I wish her the best.

00:24:47.586 --> 00:24:50.021
I do, I do, especially if
that guy needs to be exposed,

00:24:50.021 --> 00:24:51.523
all that stuff.

00:24:51.523 --> 00:24:53.425
- Yeah but also, my Dr. Phil
impression is pretty good.

00:24:53.425 --> 00:24:54.593
- It is pretty good.

00:24:54.593 --> 00:24:57.262
(upbeat music)
