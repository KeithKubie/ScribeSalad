00:00:01.367 --> 00:00:03.436
Welcome back. Now, there's been
an odd phenomena

00:00:03.469 --> 00:00:05.004
happening in the Trump campaign,

00:00:05.037 --> 00:00:07.173
and I'm not talking about
the Trump campaign.

00:00:07.206 --> 00:00:09.976
Uh, it's about
some of his followers.

00:00:10.009 --> 00:00:13.880 line:0%
And you have a lot of
black people supporting Trump.

00:00:17.049 --> 00:00:19.786
Um, black people
supporting Trump?

00:00:19.819 --> 00:00:23.156
(exclaiming)

00:00:23.189 --> 00:00:26.059
So, where are
these black people?

00:00:26.092 --> 00:00:28.895
Well, I had some of them
in my studio the other day,

00:00:28.928 --> 00:00:31.397
uh, where I asked them
the simple question:

00:00:31.430 --> 00:00:33.166
what the (bleep)
are you thinking?

00:00:33.199 --> 00:00:35.068
I just want to ask
a very straight question

00:00:35.101 --> 00:00:38.404
from the beginning. Um,
why do you support Donald Trump?

00:00:38.437 --> 00:00:40.940
I'm a registered Democrat,
let me start first,

00:00:40.973 --> 00:00:43.142
and I lost faith

00:00:43.175 --> 00:00:46.079
and belief in the current state
of our party right now

00:00:46.112 --> 00:00:47.580
with our two candidates.

00:00:47.613 --> 00:00:50.516
I'm open to Donald Trump
because I feel like,

00:00:50.549 --> 00:00:52.452
um, he's a gangster.

00:00:52.485 --> 00:00:53.786
-He's a gangster?
-He's a gangster.

00:00:53.819 --> 00:00:55.421
Is he a gangster or gangsta?

00:00:55.454 --> 00:00:57.623
-He's a gangsta.
-Okay.

00:00:57.656 --> 00:00:59.959
He's going out here
and he's kind of gangstering

00:00:59.992 --> 00:01:01.761
the whole situation.
He's like,

00:01:01.794 --> 00:01:05.398
"If you come up to my mic,
you know, I'm taking you out."

00:01:05.431 --> 00:01:07.934
-Right. -Coming from
the hip-hop community,

00:01:07.967 --> 00:01:09.469
I understand his language.

00:01:09.502 --> 00:01:11.704
Right, because
he is kind of like a rapper.

00:01:11.737 --> 00:01:14.173
-I mean, he's into gold.
-That's what I'm saying.

00:01:14.206 --> 00:01:16.476
-Right? He has his own vodka.
-Absolutely.

00:01:16.509 --> 00:01:18.377
-Uh, he's got a private jet.
-That's right.

00:01:18.410 --> 00:01:20.313
-And he really likes
white women. -Exactly.

00:01:20.346 --> 00:01:22.281
-And his wife was a model.
-Correct.

00:01:22.314 --> 00:01:24.417
Would that sway anybody else--
those qualities?

00:01:24.450 --> 00:01:26.719
The way you express it--
I-I never thought of it

00:01:26.752 --> 00:01:28.421
that way, you know,
but he's pretty cool.

00:01:28.454 --> 00:01:31.057
Have you told other black people
you're voting for Donald Trump?

00:01:31.090 --> 00:01:32.558
-Be honest. -Yeah, absolutely.
-Absolutely.

00:01:32.591 --> 00:01:34.327
Kevin, be honest.
Have you told family members?

00:01:34.360 --> 00:01:36.462
-I've told family members, I've
told... -You've told your mama

00:01:36.495 --> 00:01:38.598
-that you're voting for...
-I told my wife...

00:01:38.631 --> 00:01:41.300
-that I'm... We fight
every morning about it. -Mm-hmm.

00:01:41.333 --> 00:01:42.735
But I stand on my own, too.

00:01:42.768 --> 00:01:45.404
This is America.
America is greedy.

00:01:45.437 --> 00:01:48.207
America is going to try
to cut corners,

00:01:48.240 --> 00:01:50.076
so we have to make a place
for ourselves.

00:01:50.109 --> 00:01:52.178
So, Donald Trump
is the president

00:01:52.211 --> 00:01:54.881
who can get black people
those low-paying jobs again.

00:01:54.914 --> 00:01:56.949
No, we don't want
the low paying jobs.

00:01:56.982 --> 00:01:59.886
Lower-paying jobs are
the first rung on the ladder

00:01:59.919 --> 00:02:02.155
so you can't-you can't
climb up the ladder

00:02:02.188 --> 00:02:03.923
-till you start someplace.
-Donald Trump will get

00:02:03.956 --> 00:02:06.425
black people back on that
first rung of the ladder.

00:02:06.458 --> 00:02:08.961
If you're on the ladder here,
you're gonna climb up more.

00:02:08.994 --> 00:02:10.997
Should the Mexicans
be allowed to use that ladder

00:02:11.030 --> 00:02:12.798
-to climb the wall?
-Yes. -Most definitely.

00:02:12.831 --> 00:02:14.934
Not the wall...

00:02:14.967 --> 00:02:17.637
Do you have a message
for other black people out there

00:02:17.670 --> 00:02:19.906
telling them why they might
want to vote for Donald Trump?

00:02:19.939 --> 00:02:21.374
I'll just...
I would say just know that

00:02:21.407 --> 00:02:22.909
Donald Trump is not gonna
make you a slave.

00:02:22.942 --> 00:02:24.610
-He's<i> not</i> gonna make you
a slave? -He's not gonna

00:02:24.643 --> 00:02:26.145
make you a slave,
you're not gonna be

00:02:26.178 --> 00:02:28.014
-back in the cotton fields. -And
you're sure about that, Gary?

00:02:28.047 --> 00:02:29.382
-I'm pretty sure about that.
-Okay.

00:02:29.415 --> 00:02:32.118
-Everybody's trying
to enslave you. -Mm-hmm.

00:02:32.151 --> 00:02:35.388
But the main important thing
is how much I'm gonna get paid

00:02:35.421 --> 00:02:37.657
-while I'm enslavement,
you know? -Mm-hmm.

00:02:37.690 --> 00:02:40.626
So, you're pro-slavery
but with pay.

00:02:40.659 --> 00:02:42.061
-That's right, that's right.
-You're anti-slavery.

00:02:42.094 --> 00:02:45.398
Yeah, anti-slavery. -Okay,
anyone else pro-slavery here?

00:02:46.966 --> 00:02:50.536
Donald Trump says he has a great
relationship with the blacks.

00:02:50.569 --> 00:02:52.471
Okay, as one of the blacks,

00:02:52.504 --> 00:02:54.140
how would you describe
that relationship?

00:02:54.173 --> 00:02:56.576
-The fact that he says "the
blacks"... -"The blacks", right.

00:02:56.609 --> 00:02:59.345
...means that his relationship
is a little skewed,

00:02:59.378 --> 00:03:01.380
because he wouldn't
call us "the blacks"

00:03:01.413 --> 00:03:03.816
if he really understood
where we were coming from.

00:03:03.849 --> 00:03:05.885
Does it feel like he's
in an abusive relationship

00:03:05.918 --> 00:03:07.320
with the blacks?
Are you guys

00:03:07.353 --> 00:03:09.555
secretly trying
to get out of this relationship?

00:03:09.588 --> 00:03:12.592
-Not at all. -Okay, so how did
you guys feel when Trump said

00:03:12.625 --> 00:03:14.694
he wants to ban Muslims
from coming into the country?

00:03:14.727 --> 00:03:16.562
-We don't have any Muslims
here, right? -I'm Muslim.

00:03:16.595 --> 00:03:18.464
-You're kidding me.
-No, I'm not kidding you.

00:03:18.497 --> 00:03:20.567
-And you're gonna vote
for Trump? -Most certainly.

00:03:23.102 --> 00:03:25.204
-Really?
-Yes.

00:03:25.237 --> 00:03:28.441
Would you be opposed, uh,
to having Trump waterboard you

00:03:28.474 --> 00:03:30.576
just to get more information
about Islam?

00:03:30.609 --> 00:03:33.813
-Um... -If Trump came in here
and he had to pick one person

00:03:33.846 --> 00:03:37.116
to waterboard,
who do you think he would pick?

00:03:37.149 --> 00:03:39.986
Rhymes with schmuslim?

00:03:40.019 --> 00:03:41.487
Um...

00:03:41.520 --> 00:03:43.656
Let's pretend like
I'm your father, okay?

00:03:43.689 --> 00:03:45.124
You guys are all my kids

00:03:45.157 --> 00:03:46.826
and you have to convince me

00:03:46.859 --> 00:03:48.694
-that I should vote for
Donald Trump, okay? -Absolutely.

00:03:48.727 --> 00:03:50.596
Hey, kids, how's it going?
Why do you guys...

00:03:50.629 --> 00:03:52.465
Why are you guys all here?
What's going on?

00:03:52.498 --> 00:03:54.934
Dad, we're about to vote for
Donald Trump, and we need you...

00:03:54.967 --> 00:03:56.235
Jenay, you're so funny.

00:03:56.268 --> 00:03:58.104
Jenay is always the funniest
member of this family.

00:03:58.137 --> 00:04:00.506
All right, you guys want to go
to the movies tonight?

00:04:00.539 --> 00:04:03.175
-What do you want to do? I'm
sorry? -No, we need you to...

00:04:03.208 --> 00:04:05.044
we need you to cast
your vote as well.

00:04:05.077 --> 00:04:07.580
-What are you talking about?
-Because we can't just

00:04:07.613 --> 00:04:10.349
-be Democrats because
we're black. -That's right.

00:04:10.382 --> 00:04:12.385
Wait, hold on.
Winston, you believe this, too?

00:04:12.418 --> 00:04:14.086
I believe her 100%.

00:04:14.119 --> 00:04:16.555
(bleep), please. Come on,
what's going on in here?

00:04:16.588 --> 00:04:19.292
Are you voting for Trump
because, as an Orange-American,

00:04:19.325 --> 00:04:21.193
he's the only remaining
candidate of color?

00:04:21.226 --> 00:04:24.530
I'm tired of the jokes.
Stop the jokes on Donald Trump.

00:04:24.563 --> 00:04:26.732
You guys know
I'm a fake journalist, right?

00:04:26.765 --> 00:04:28.434
Absolutely.

00:04:28.467 --> 00:04:30.703
What kind of disturbs me
in some of these rallies is

00:04:30.736 --> 00:04:32.571
you guys have seen this,
where Trump gets everybody

00:04:32.604 --> 00:04:34.206
to make a pledge?
Have you seen that?

00:04:34.239 --> 00:04:36.075
Where he has them
pledge to vote for him?

00:04:36.108 --> 00:04:37.977
I just want you guys
to raise your hand

00:04:38.010 --> 00:04:39.945
and we'll just
take a pledge right now.

00:04:39.978 --> 00:04:42.648
Okay. And, um, just say,

00:04:42.681 --> 00:04:44.317
I will never
tell black people...

00:04:44.350 --> 00:04:46.786
I will never tell
black people...

00:04:46.819 --> 00:04:48.821
...that I am voting
for Donald Trump...

00:04:48.854 --> 00:04:50.389
...that I am
voting for Donald Trump...

00:04:50.422 --> 00:04:51.657
...until after the election.

00:04:51.690 --> 00:04:53.259
...until after
the election.

00:04:53.292 --> 00:04:55.027
I love the fact that, uh,

00:04:55.060 --> 00:04:57.330
you spoke so freely
and passionately about this.

00:04:57.363 --> 00:04:58.798
And, uh, thanks for coming.

00:04:58.831 --> 00:05:01.467
-Pleasure having us. -Thank you.
-Thank you very much.

00:05:01.500 --> 00:05:04.233
I still don't get it.
We'll be right back.
