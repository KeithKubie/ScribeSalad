00:00:00.170 --> 00:00:01.600
- My name is Kelly Kramarik,

00:00:01.600 --> 00:00:05.240
I am 25 years old, and I'm
a freelance audio engineer.

00:00:05.240 --> 00:00:07.650
Some people just stay in one trade,

00:00:07.650 --> 00:00:09.400
one part of audio.

00:00:09.400 --> 00:00:11.590
I like to do a little bit of everything,

00:00:11.590 --> 00:00:14.000
so I work in a studio as a recording

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:15.350
and mixing engineer.

00:00:15.350 --> 00:00:17.610
I work in live sound as a monitor

00:00:17.610 --> 00:00:19.290
and front-of-house engineer.

00:00:19.290 --> 00:00:21.700
In film, I'm a production sound mixer,

00:00:21.700 --> 00:00:24.920
so my main goal is to
get the dialogue on set.

00:00:24.920 --> 00:00:26.410
Then, in post-production,

00:00:26.410 --> 00:00:28.800
that's when we focus on sound effects,

00:00:28.800 --> 00:00:31.210
creating them, taking them from a library,

00:00:31.210 --> 00:00:34.030
fully recording that, footsteps,

00:00:34.030 --> 00:00:35.560
basically re-creating the world

00:00:35.560 --> 00:00:38.290
that we already recorded
in a studio setting

00:00:38.290 --> 00:00:40.070
so we have more control over it.

00:00:40.070 --> 00:00:41.660
So, I went to school for business

00:00:41.660 --> 00:00:43.310
and I was a vocal minor.

00:00:43.310 --> 00:00:46.570
I had to take an elective
for my vocal classes

00:00:46.570 --> 00:00:49.220
and it was called Music Technology,

00:00:49.220 --> 00:00:50.330
and it was all about, you know,

00:00:50.330 --> 00:00:52.870
microphones and speakers, and music,

00:00:52.870 --> 00:00:54.840
and I was like, "What?",

00:00:54.840 --> 00:00:57.150
like, "This is something I can do?"

00:00:57.150 --> 00:01:00.170
I just, I don't know why my whole life,

00:01:00.170 --> 00:01:03.710
in music, I had no idea that
audio engineering was a thing.

00:01:03.710 --> 00:01:06.210
Once I took that Music Technology class,

00:01:06.210 --> 00:01:10.900
I changed my major to
multidisciplinary studies,

00:01:10.900 --> 00:01:13.590
which is when three
minors make up your major.

00:01:13.590 --> 00:01:15.750
We didn't have a music tech major program,

00:01:15.750 --> 00:01:18.240
so that's how I kinda finagled it,

00:01:18.240 --> 00:01:20.730
and then I studied
theater and advertising.

00:01:20.730 --> 00:01:22.460
So, the theater side of things,

00:01:22.460 --> 00:01:24.810
I did theater sound design,

00:01:24.810 --> 00:01:27.710
which audio engineering
in theater is huge,

00:01:27.710 --> 00:01:28.890
so that's a whole nother avenue

00:01:28.890 --> 00:01:30.100
that you can study.

00:01:30.100 --> 00:01:32.840
And then, advertising because
I knew I was probably gonna

00:01:32.840 --> 00:01:35.580
have to be a freelance person,

00:01:35.580 --> 00:01:37.650
and so, I wanted to be
able to market myself.

00:01:37.650 --> 00:01:39.820
I graduated from West Virginia

00:01:39.820 --> 00:01:41.070
with my bachelor of science

00:01:41.070 --> 00:01:44.490
and multidisciplinary
studies three years ago,

00:01:44.490 --> 00:01:47.880
and then I immediately
moved out to Denver.

00:01:47.880 --> 00:01:49.560
I didn't have a job lined up.

00:01:49.560 --> 00:01:52.360
I knew there were studios in Denver.

00:01:52.360 --> 00:01:53.740
I contacted a bunch of them

00:01:53.740 --> 00:01:56.180
and no one wanted anything to do with me,

00:01:56.180 --> 00:01:59.670
so for about two years out here,

00:01:59.670 --> 00:02:02.820
for the first year, I
did nothing but bartend.

00:02:02.820 --> 00:02:04.850
So, I was a bartender all through college

00:02:04.850 --> 00:02:07.490
and I was bartending out here as well,

00:02:07.490 --> 00:02:10.710
and then I found the master's program,

00:02:10.710 --> 00:02:11.697
and I was like, "You know what?

00:02:11.697 --> 00:02:13.197
"If no one wants to hire me right now,

00:02:13.197 --> 00:02:15.360
"maybe I need to hone
in some more skills."

00:02:15.360 --> 00:02:18.430
And so, I decided to
apply for graduate school.

00:02:18.430 --> 00:02:19.890
You don't need to go to school,

00:02:19.890 --> 00:02:21.450
but it definitely gives you a leg up

00:02:21.450 --> 00:02:24.520
on the competition, depending
on their experience,

00:02:24.520 --> 00:02:27.520
obviously, so once I started interning,

00:02:27.520 --> 00:02:29.830
I was interning at this studio

00:02:29.830 --> 00:02:32.430
in this past summer.

00:02:32.430 --> 00:02:34.490
And the way that I got
that was just networking,

00:02:34.490 --> 00:02:35.990
those engineer meetup groups

00:02:35.990 --> 00:02:37.380
where I go to every studio,

00:02:37.380 --> 00:02:38.550
I always talk to the owners.

00:02:38.550 --> 00:02:40.650
We had a meetup at this studio

00:02:40.650 --> 00:02:44.120
and I came to it, and I
was talking to my boss

00:02:44.120 --> 00:02:45.230
and he said to call him.

00:02:45.230 --> 00:02:47.650
And so, I called him and
I sent him my resume,

00:02:47.650 --> 00:02:49.290
and he hired me as an intern.

00:02:49.290 --> 00:02:52.380
So, I interned here for
a while over the summer,

00:02:52.380 --> 00:02:54.260
and then at the end of the summer,

00:02:54.260 --> 00:02:58.240
he hired me on as a
freelance audio engineer.

00:02:58.240 --> 00:03:00.970
Randomly, I got a call
from a producer in L.A.,

00:03:00.970 --> 00:03:03.500
I got a call from a producer in New York,

00:03:03.500 --> 00:03:05.870
all asking me if I can do production audio

00:03:05.870 --> 00:03:08.887
for their gigs, and I
was like, "Yeah, like,

00:03:08.887 --> 00:03:10.990
"that's awesome," and I'm wondering how

00:03:10.990 --> 00:03:13.320
they got my name, and I find out it's just

00:03:13.320 --> 00:03:16.500
from one connection
where I did a good job,

00:03:16.500 --> 00:03:19.000
and so, they give my name out to people.

00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:22.850
One other way, I guess, that
I've been getting jobs is,

00:03:22.850 --> 00:03:25.300
production houses in Denver don't

00:03:25.300 --> 00:03:29.080
have audio people on
staff, and I noticed that

00:03:29.080 --> 00:03:31.570
when I was researching
different production houses

00:03:31.570 --> 00:03:34.150
on their websites, they
didn't have audio people.

00:03:34.150 --> 00:03:37.097
So, I just started sending
them emails with my rates,

00:03:37.097 --> 00:03:39.580
"If you ever need an audio
person, let me know,"

00:03:39.580 --> 00:03:41.020
and I've gotten a couple of calls

00:03:41.020 --> 00:03:43.300
from people that way, as well.

00:03:43.300 --> 00:03:44.800
So, just being super proactive

00:03:46.173 --> 00:03:48.230
and saying yes to everything

00:03:48.230 --> 00:03:51.103
is how I've gotten where I am right now.
