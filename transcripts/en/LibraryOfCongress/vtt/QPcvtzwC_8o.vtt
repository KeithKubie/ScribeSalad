&gt;&gt; From the Library of
Congress in Washington D.C.

00:00:06.670 --> 00:00:07.970
&gt;&gt; Well our next guest,

00:00:07.970 --> 00:00:11.520
author Nathaniel Philbrick
is himself a history buff.

00:00:11.520 --> 00:00:14.100
And he's written numerous
award winning books

00:00:14.100 --> 00:00:15.930
about our nation's past.

00:00:15.930 --> 00:00:21.200
Many of these including "In the
Heart of the Sea", "Sea of Glory"

00:00:21.200 --> 00:00:26.280
and "Mayflower" reflect his life
long love of sailing and the sea.

00:00:26.280 --> 00:00:30.320
Has anybody been sailing before?

00:00:30.320 --> 00:00:34.700
His more recent books, "Bunker
Hill" and "Valiant Ambition" focus

00:00:34.700 --> 00:00:38.340
on the events and figures
of the American Revolution.

00:00:38.340 --> 00:00:42.710
In fact, the American
Revolution is the backdrop

00:00:42.710 --> 00:00:45.850
for Nathaniel Philbrick's
first children's book.

00:00:45.850 --> 00:00:50.650
"Ben's Revolution: Benjamin Russell
and the Battle of Bunker Hill".

00:00:50.650 --> 00:00:54.740
School Library Journal describes
it as quote "A string account

00:00:54.740 --> 00:00:57.340
of the American Revolution
sure to resonate

00:00:57.340 --> 00:01:00.380
with elementary students"
-- end quote.

00:01:00.380 --> 00:01:05.070
Nathaniel will be signing of
his books from 2:00 to 3:00

00:01:05.070 --> 00:01:07.210
down in the signing area.

00:01:07.210 --> 00:01:09.770
So without further ado
let's put our hands together

00:01:09.770 --> 00:01:12.510
and welcome Nathaniel Philbrick.

00:01:12.510 --> 00:01:20.040
[ Applause ]

00:01:20.040 --> 00:01:21.980
&gt;&gt; Nathaniel Philbrick: Hello,
it is great to be here in D.C.

00:01:21.980 --> 00:01:25.160
on this rainy day and great to
have you sitting around here.

00:01:25.160 --> 00:01:28.160
And yeah, I write books
about history.

00:01:28.160 --> 00:01:31.850
About things that actually
happened in America's past.

00:01:31.850 --> 00:01:37.040
And "Ben's Revolution" is about
a boy who was 12-years-old

00:01:37.040 --> 00:01:39.590
when the Revolution
broke out in Boston,

00:01:39.590 --> 00:01:42.260
Massachusetts which
is actually the city

00:01:42.260 --> 00:01:45.270
where I grew up, where I was born.

00:01:45.270 --> 00:01:47.140
I was born in Boston.

00:01:47.140 --> 00:01:51.010
But I actually grew up in a place
called Pittsburg, Pennsylvania.

00:01:51.010 --> 00:01:52.310
[ Cheering ]

00:01:52.310 --> 00:01:53.610
All right.

00:01:53.610 --> 00:01:54.910
Some Steelers fans out there.

00:01:54.910 --> 00:01:59.640
And it was when I was in
fifth great I read the book

00:01:59.640 --> 00:02:04.010
that would really change my
life -- "Johnny Tremain".

00:02:04.010 --> 00:02:05.310
[ Cheering ]

00:02:05.310 --> 00:02:07.470
Yeah, we have some "Johnny
Tremain" lovers out there.

00:02:07.470 --> 00:02:11.740
I mean this was a book about a
young boy who was apprenticed

00:02:11.740 --> 00:02:17.490
as a silversmith, so he was making
beautiful silver bowls and platters

00:02:17.490 --> 00:02:20.870
and things and he suffered
a terrible accident and so

00:02:20.870 --> 00:02:24.530
that he couldn't be a silversmith
anymore and he got caught

00:02:24.530 --> 00:02:28.380
up in the Revolution and became
a real important part of it.

00:02:28.380 --> 00:02:30.480
And for me it was just amazing.

00:02:30.480 --> 00:02:34.970
History wasn't about dates
and statues of old people,

00:02:34.970 --> 00:02:37.700
it was about kids just
like me who --

00:02:37.700 --> 00:02:42.100
ordinary kids who got caught
up in extraordinary events.

00:02:42.100 --> 00:02:44.800
And this was just -- it like
-- I just couldn't believe it.

00:02:44.800 --> 00:02:49.200
So that's back in my past
where people just like me.

00:02:49.200 --> 00:02:50.500
And then I went to high school

00:02:50.500 --> 00:02:53.010
and I had a great history
teacher named Miss Wilt,

00:02:53.010 --> 00:02:55.560
who taught me about
American history.

00:02:55.560 --> 00:03:00.060
We still exchange Christmas
cards every year.

00:03:00.060 --> 00:03:09.730
And then in 1984 when I was almost
30 years old we moved to Boston

00:03:09.730 --> 00:03:14.030
where the Revolution
broke out in 1775.

00:03:14.030 --> 00:03:18.540
And by that time I had a year and
half old daughter named Jennie,

00:03:18.540 --> 00:03:20.570
and I was at home taking care

00:03:20.570 --> 00:03:25.230
of Jennie while her mother
was a lawyer keeping us going.

00:03:25.230 --> 00:03:31.110 position:56%
And we lived in the North End, which
is the historic center of Boston.

00:03:31.110 --> 00:03:32.800
And it's just so cool.

00:03:32.800 --> 00:03:35.810
It has all these crooked
streets and old houses.

00:03:35.810 --> 00:03:38.710
Some of them look like
they're going to fall down.

00:03:38.710 --> 00:03:42.570 position:56%
And then I used to push Jennie's
stroller through the crooked streets

00:03:42.570 --> 00:03:45.860
of the North End and we'd
always end up at the top

00:03:45.860 --> 00:03:49.980
of this hill called Copp's Hill
where there was this really,

00:03:49.980 --> 00:03:53.960
really old burial ground
where they had stones,

00:03:53.960 --> 00:03:56.080
you know the old grave stones.

00:03:56.080 --> 00:03:57.380
And you know what?

00:03:57.380 --> 00:04:01.670
It was so old that these
grave stones were there

00:04:01.670 --> 00:04:04.330
when the Revolution
broke out way back

00:04:04.330 --> 00:04:08.440
in 1775, more than 200 years ago.

00:04:08.440 --> 00:04:12.790
And some of these grave
stones had chips in them

00:04:12.790 --> 00:04:17.230
from where British soldiers
who didn't like the politics

00:04:17.230 --> 00:04:20.530
of whoever was buried there
fired on the gravestones.

00:04:20.530 --> 00:04:23.980
And that was just amazing
to me to see a stone

00:04:23.980 --> 00:04:29.960
that had been chipped way back in
1775 during the Boston Revolution.

00:04:29.960 --> 00:04:34.480
And when you look out from Copp's
Hill you look across Boston Harbor

00:04:34.480 --> 00:04:36.820
and there not too far away

00:04:36.820 --> 00:04:43.100 position:56%
on the other side is a place called
Charlestown and there is a monument,

00:04:43.100 --> 00:04:46.290
a great big tall monument,
sort of a small version

00:04:46.290 --> 00:04:51.380
of the Washington Monument that you
have here and it's where the Battle

00:04:51.380 --> 00:04:53.760
of Bunker Hill was fought.

00:04:53.760 --> 00:04:58.170
And Jennie and I would look out
at that and I began to wonder,

00:04:58.170 --> 00:05:02.250
"What was Boston like back in
the time of the Revolution?"

00:05:02.250 --> 00:05:05.780
And so every -- we developed
a routine where every Sunday,

00:05:05.780 --> 00:05:11.330
I sort of had that day off and
Jennie's mom was taking care

00:05:11.330 --> 00:05:15.220
of Jennie and I would get
on what is called the "T"

00:05:15.220 --> 00:05:17.220
in Boston, it's the subway.

00:05:17.220 --> 00:05:21.600
And I would go to the
Boston Public Library.

00:05:21.600 --> 00:05:24.230
And you go into the
stacks and I was look --

00:05:24.230 --> 00:05:28.470
what I wanted to find out what
was Boston like back then.

00:05:28.470 --> 00:05:31.890
And I just learned some
amazing things that Boston,

00:05:31.890 --> 00:05:36.750
the way it looks today was nothing
like Boston looked back then.

00:05:36.750 --> 00:05:40.730
Now Boston looks like a city that's
all spread out, that has a bunch

00:05:40.730 --> 00:05:44.250
of neighborhoods, there's
the Back Bay neighborhood,

00:05:44.250 --> 00:05:46.590
there's Beacon Hill neighborhood.

00:05:46.590 --> 00:05:51.250
But back in 1775, Boston
was an Island.

00:05:51.250 --> 00:05:57.450 position:56%
It was a 1.1 square mile island with
high hills, almost like mountains.

00:05:57.450 --> 00:06:01.130
Three mountains dominating
this little island.

00:06:01.130 --> 00:06:06.280
And then it had this very
narrow band of land that --

00:06:06.280 --> 00:06:09.710
it was called the neck, that
connected this island to the town

00:06:09.710 --> 00:06:12.940
of Roxbury, which was
on the mainland.

00:06:12.940 --> 00:06:17.130
And so that was -- my gosh,
is that the way it was?

00:06:17.130 --> 00:06:22.340
And across from the Boston
Harbor was then Charlestown,

00:06:22.340 --> 00:06:25.850
which was a town on
it's own little island.

00:06:25.850 --> 00:06:27.600
Now this got me to thinking.

00:06:27.600 --> 00:06:31.700
It was for the first time --
back then I wrote about sailboats

00:06:31.700 --> 00:06:35.760
and I started to say,
I'm really interested

00:06:35.760 --> 00:06:38.880
in what it was like in the past.

00:06:38.880 --> 00:06:41.090
My wife and I and Jeannie

00:06:41.090 --> 00:06:45.670 position:56%
and eventually her younger brother
Ethan, ended up moving to an island,

00:06:45.670 --> 00:06:50.080
to Nantucket Island,
that's off of the south edge

00:06:50.080 --> 00:06:52.170
of Cape Cod in Massachusetts.

00:06:52.170 --> 00:06:55.470
And this island is
30 miles out to sea.

00:06:55.470 --> 00:06:58.590
If you take a fairy that
has cars on it, it takes two

00:06:58.590 --> 00:07:00.950
and half hours to get there.

00:07:00.950 --> 00:07:04.210
And I was just fascinated
by this island and I said,

00:07:04.210 --> 00:07:08.190
and this was the whaling capital of
the world back in the 19th Century

00:07:08.190 --> 00:07:11.440
and so I started learning
about Nantucket's history

00:07:11.440 --> 00:07:13.480
and I would ultimately
write my first book

00:07:13.480 --> 00:07:16.970
about history about Nantucket.

00:07:16.970 --> 00:07:20.560
But when i was researching
it I got all of that book,

00:07:20.560 --> 00:07:23.160
I got all of these
stories about Boston

00:07:23.160 --> 00:07:26.270
and the Revolution bubbling up.

00:07:26.270 --> 00:07:29.080
Benjamin Franklin, have
you ever heard of him?

00:07:29.080 --> 00:07:30.380
Yeah, yeah.

00:07:30.380 --> 00:07:34.790
Benjamin Franklin's mother
was born on Nantucket.

00:07:34.790 --> 00:07:39.080
And Benjamin Franklin, at the
time the revolution broke out was

00:07:39.080 --> 00:07:43.060
in England trying to stop the
revolution from happening.

00:07:43.060 --> 00:07:45.600
He was hoping that we could all --

00:07:45.600 --> 00:07:48.240
that England and her
American colonies could figure

00:07:48.240 --> 00:07:51.090
out a way to avoid a war.

00:07:51.090 --> 00:07:53.130
But it didn't happen.

00:07:53.130 --> 00:07:56.960
And he became one of
our foremost patriots.

00:07:56.960 --> 00:08:00.170
And have you all heard
of the Boston Tea Party?

00:08:00.170 --> 00:08:02.020
The Boston Tea Party?

00:08:02.020 --> 00:08:07.590
OK, well there were three ships
in the Boston Tea Party that came

00:08:07.590 --> 00:08:12.030
from England with tea that the king
wanted to sell to the colonists.

00:08:12.030 --> 00:08:16.120
But the colonists were angry
because there was a tax that was --

00:08:16.120 --> 00:08:19.280
they were going to be charged
if they bought the tea.

00:08:19.280 --> 00:08:21.310
So what did they do?

00:08:21.310 --> 00:08:25.720
They threw the tea -- they
took the tea off the ships

00:08:25.720 --> 00:08:28.180
and threw it into the harbor.

00:08:28.180 --> 00:08:30.240
And what did they call it?

00:08:30.240 --> 00:08:33.770
Yes, the Boston Tea Party.

00:08:33.770 --> 00:08:38.760
And in fact one boy who was
watching all this shouted out,

00:08:38.760 --> 00:08:45.140
and this is in my book, "Boston
Harbor is a teapot tonight."

00:08:45.140 --> 00:08:49.320
Well, two of those ships,
guess where they came from?

00:08:49.320 --> 00:08:50.910
Nantucket Island.

00:08:50.910 --> 00:08:55.620
They were whale ships that had
taken whale oil to England and then

00:08:55.620 --> 00:09:00.160
on their way back put tea aboard
and it brought it back to sell --

00:09:00.160 --> 00:09:03.210
and then got caught up
in the Boston tea party.

00:09:03.210 --> 00:09:08.070
So I was going, wow I want to
write about the revolution.

00:09:08.070 --> 00:09:11.620
And then, you know,
Nantucket is an island, right?

00:09:11.620 --> 00:09:13.660
And we know Boston was an island.

00:09:13.660 --> 00:09:17.770
And Boston back then
had 15,000 people in it.

00:09:17.770 --> 00:09:20.520
That's a small, it's a small town.

00:09:20.520 --> 00:09:23.730
Do you know how many people
live year round in Nantucket?

00:09:23.730 --> 00:09:28.970
15,000. And I began to realize
after I lived on Nantucket

00:09:28.970 --> 00:09:32.600
for a few years, you know if
you're living in an island

00:09:32.600 --> 00:09:35.520
with 15,000 people you get to --

00:09:35.520 --> 00:09:39.100
you may not know everyone's
name but you know them.

00:09:39.100 --> 00:09:41.110
You know what they look like.

00:09:41.110 --> 00:09:42.740
They're familiar to you.

00:09:42.740 --> 00:09:48.830
And I began to realize that when
the Revolution broke out in Boston,

00:09:48.830 --> 00:09:54.090
it was friends, neighbors,
acquaintances,

00:09:54.090 --> 00:09:57.160
that suddenly you know
they used to work together

00:09:57.160 --> 00:10:00.840
but suddenly their differences
meant that they didn't

00:10:00.840 --> 00:10:03.040
like each other necessarily.

00:10:03.040 --> 00:10:05.320
And the change that
created in a community,

00:10:05.320 --> 00:10:09.260
I began to understand
in a very emotional way.

00:10:09.260 --> 00:10:11.370
An then on Nantucket
we have a tradition

00:10:11.370 --> 00:10:13.610
that many New England
towns still do.

00:10:13.610 --> 00:10:15.960
It's called the town meeting.

00:10:15.960 --> 00:10:22.730
Where to decide very big issues of
the day, everybody who is a voter

00:10:22.730 --> 00:10:28.250
on Nantucket goes in -- we go
to our high school auditorium.

00:10:28.250 --> 00:10:33.560
We have a town moderator who runs
the meeting and we vote on issues

00:10:33.560 --> 00:10:35.010
that are very important to us.

00:10:35.010 --> 00:10:37.270
And you here people
yell at each other.

00:10:37.270 --> 00:10:40.020
You hear people praise each other,

00:10:40.020 --> 00:10:42.700
but you know what this
-- this is democracy.

00:10:42.700 --> 00:10:46.380
This is democracy being
enacted in a town.

00:10:46.380 --> 00:10:49.310
And that's how the Revolution

00:10:49.310 --> 00:10:52.950
in Boston began, was
with town meetings.

00:10:52.950 --> 00:10:56.050
With people in town meetings
discussing the issues

00:10:56.050 --> 00:11:00.950
of the day and, you know, those of
you who have been on the internet

00:11:00.950 --> 00:11:02.490
and maybe know chat rooms.

00:11:02.490 --> 00:11:08.460
Back in 18th Century Boston as the
Revolution was beginning to swell

00:11:08.460 --> 00:11:12.550
across Massachusetts, those were
the chat rooms, the town meeting.

00:11:12.550 --> 00:11:16.200
And I realized I've got
write about the Revolution.

00:11:16.200 --> 00:11:18.280
So I would write a book
called "Bunker Hill".

00:11:18.280 --> 00:11:21.260
I told you about the monument.

00:11:21.260 --> 00:11:22.560
It's about the battle.

00:11:22.560 --> 00:11:27.210
But it begins with the Boston
Tea Party and follows as --

00:11:27.210 --> 00:11:28.600 position:56%
because the British, once they heard

00:11:28.600 --> 00:11:31.390
of the Boston Tea Party
they were very angry

00:11:31.390 --> 00:11:33.570
and passed the Boston Port Act,

00:11:33.570 --> 00:11:37.780
which closed the town
of Boston as a port.

00:11:37.780 --> 00:11:41.650
It gave the people no way to
make money to support themselves.

00:11:41.650 --> 00:11:46.080
And they sent a general,
a general Thomas Gage

00:11:46.080 --> 00:11:50.400
to become their military governor
and the people were not happy.

00:11:50.400 --> 00:11:53.330
And more and more soldiers
came to Boston.

00:11:53.330 --> 00:11:54.950
And more and more people

00:11:54.950 --> 00:11:58.830
who considered themselves
patriots left the town

00:11:58.830 --> 00:12:05.000
until Boston became occupied
by 9,000 British soldiers.

00:12:05.000 --> 00:12:07.390
That's a lot of British soldiers.

00:12:07.390 --> 00:12:10.510
And the people who stayed in
Boston many of them were not happy

00:12:10.510 --> 00:12:14.240
and there would be fights in
the streets and a lot of tension

00:12:14.240 --> 00:12:22.560
until finally on April 19th, 1775
when Thomas Gage sent some soldiers

00:12:22.560 --> 00:12:28.220
to the town of Concord to get the
cannons, and guns, and ammunition

00:12:28.220 --> 00:12:31.350
that the patriots had
collected there.

00:12:31.350 --> 00:12:35.300 position:56%
He sent several hundred soldiers out
and on their way to Concord they had

00:12:35.300 --> 00:12:37.740
to go to through the
town of Lexington .

00:12:37.740 --> 00:12:41.840
And on the Green in Lexington
there were a whole line

00:12:41.840 --> 00:12:47.070
of militiamen stood in their
way and guess what happened?

00:12:47.070 --> 00:12:50.890
The first shot of the
Revolution was fired.

00:12:50.890 --> 00:12:52.990
When we don't know if
it was a militiamen

00:12:52.990 --> 00:12:56.570 position:56%
or a British soldier but it started.

00:12:56.570 --> 00:13:00.450
And then the British then went and
several militiamen were killed.

00:13:00.450 --> 00:13:02.880
They then go to Concord and
then they have a big fight

00:13:02.880 --> 00:13:06.270
at the old North Bridge
where more people are killed.

00:13:06.270 --> 00:13:08.700
And then the soldiers have
to fight there way house

00:13:08.700 --> 00:13:11.250
by house back to Boston.

00:13:11.250 --> 00:13:17.900
And they get back to Boston, the
British close Boston to anybody

00:13:17.900 --> 00:13:20.640
who is not on their side.

00:13:20.640 --> 00:13:24.730
All of those militiamen who
were from every town crowd

00:13:24.730 --> 00:13:28.380
into nearby towns of
Cambridge and Roxbury.

00:13:28.380 --> 00:13:34.640
And suddenly Boston is a British
occupied city under siege.

00:13:34.640 --> 00:13:38.180
At one point the British think
about trying to punch out

00:13:38.180 --> 00:13:39.900
and attack the Americans.

00:13:39.900 --> 00:13:42.040
But to stop them the
Americans decide

00:13:42.040 --> 00:13:46.240
to build a fort on Bunker Hill.

00:13:46.240 --> 00:13:47.540
They would get the wrong hill,

00:13:47.540 --> 00:13:48.980
they'd actually do
it on Breed's Hill.

00:13:48.980 --> 00:13:50.510
So it's a little confusing.

00:13:50.510 --> 00:13:54.980
But it was by when the British
woke up on a June morning

00:13:54.980 --> 00:14:03.310
and saw this fort, they decided
they were going to attack them.

00:14:03.310 --> 00:14:06.420
And so they sent over
2,000 British soldiers

00:14:06.420 --> 00:14:10.260
and boats across the harbor.

00:14:10.260 --> 00:14:12.600
They rowed them across,
they off loaded

00:14:12.600 --> 00:14:15.710
on to Charlestown, the peninsula.

00:14:15.710 --> 00:14:19.300
And they marched up the
hill towards this fort,

00:14:19.300 --> 00:14:21.690
which was full of patriot soldiers.

00:14:21.690 --> 00:14:24.770
They thought they would be
able to take them very easily.

00:14:24.770 --> 00:14:28.070
They were under General
Howe who was leading them.

00:14:28.070 --> 00:14:32.110
They went up once and the
patriots stood their ground

00:14:32.110 --> 00:14:34.340
and forced the soldiers back.

00:14:34.340 --> 00:14:35.870
They went up twice.

00:14:35.870 --> 00:14:40.790
Again the patriots held their
ground and forced the British back.

00:14:40.790 --> 00:14:45.030
And a third time they went
up and the American's --

00:14:45.030 --> 00:14:48.740
the militiamen ran
out of ammunition.

00:14:48.740 --> 00:14:53.020
They could only fight the British
soldiers with their musket,

00:14:53.020 --> 00:14:54.320
the butts of their muskets,

00:14:54.320 --> 00:14:56.450
hitting them over the head
and they had to retreat.

00:14:56.450 --> 00:15:00.970
And the British won the battle but
they had lost so many soldiers,

00:15:00.970 --> 00:15:04.740
almost half their soldiers had
been either killed or wounded

00:15:04.740 --> 00:15:10.280
that it was a British victory but
a moral victory for the Americans.

00:15:10.280 --> 00:15:14.340
And now everyone in Boston, many
of whom had watched the battle

00:15:14.340 --> 00:15:16.090
on the roofs of their houses.

00:15:16.090 --> 00:15:19.500
This just happened a half
mile across the harbor.

00:15:19.500 --> 00:15:22.980
It was like, you know, we watch
sometimes watch things on TV,

00:15:22.980 --> 00:15:26.250
they were watching it from the
roofs of their houses and they knew

00:15:26.250 --> 00:15:28.050
that the history of the country

00:15:28.050 --> 00:15:30.670
and the world could
change with this battle.

00:15:30.670 --> 00:15:34.800
And they realized this
was no longer a rebellion.

00:15:34.800 --> 00:15:37.130
This was now a war.

00:15:37.130 --> 00:15:41.440 position:56%
A few weeks later George Washington,
you guys ever hear of him?

00:15:41.440 --> 00:15:47.570
Yes. George Washington arrives
and takes charge of the Army.

00:15:47.570 --> 00:15:50.860
And it will become
the Continental Army.

00:15:50.860 --> 00:15:55.320
He conducts a siege for nine months
trying to get the British out.

00:15:55.320 --> 00:15:58.640
A bookseller who becomes
the artillery --

00:15:58.640 --> 00:16:03.190
head of artillery for the American
Army, Henry Knox brings cannons,

00:16:03.190 --> 00:16:07.850
more than hundreds of miles down
from Lake Champlain to the North.

00:16:07.850 --> 00:16:15.780
Those go on the high
ground overlooking Boston.

00:16:15.780 --> 00:16:18.000
And the British realize
they have to leave.

00:16:18.000 --> 00:16:22.320
And in March 1775 the British leave

00:16:22.320 --> 00:16:27.030
and Washington has
knocked the British out.

00:16:27.030 --> 00:16:31.540
The war would go on for many more
years but this was the beginning.

00:16:31.540 --> 00:16:34.540
And it was researching
Bunker Hill I discovered

00:16:34.540 --> 00:16:43.220
that there was a 12-year-old
boy named Benjamin Russell

00:16:43.220 --> 00:16:48.340
who was good friends with the
newspaper man, Isaiah Thomas

00:16:48.340 --> 00:16:53.140
and when the -- on the
day that Revolution broke

00:16:53.140 --> 00:16:56.810 position:56%
out on April 19th, he was in school.

00:16:56.810 --> 00:17:00.570
They hear the Revolution, they
follow the British soldiers

00:17:00.570 --> 00:17:05.120
who are sent out as reinforcements
off the island of Boston,

00:17:05.120 --> 00:17:08.200
down the neck to Roxbury,
follow the soldiers

00:17:08.200 --> 00:17:10.910
across the Charles
river to Cambridge.

00:17:10.910 --> 00:17:14.370
They play in Cambridge,
having a great time,

00:17:14.370 --> 00:17:17.050
and then they start hearing firing.

00:17:17.050 --> 00:17:19.820
They hear the British Soldiers
coming back from Lexington

00:17:19.820 --> 00:17:22.950
and Concord, fighting
their way back to Boston.

00:17:22.950 --> 00:17:27.650
They go, "Oh my gosh, we better
get home to our parents in Boston."

00:17:27.650 --> 00:17:30.010
But when they turn
to go back to Boston,

00:17:30.010 --> 00:17:32.640
the British soldiers say, "Stop.

00:17:32.640 --> 00:17:35.130
You cannot go back to Boston.

00:17:35.130 --> 00:17:37.050
The war has begun."

00:17:37.050 --> 00:17:39.350
And so Benjamin Russell

00:17:39.350 --> 00:17:44.590
and his friends are trapped outside
Boston during the siege of Boston.

00:17:44.590 --> 00:17:48.560
Benjamin Russell becomes
employed by the American army.

00:17:48.560 --> 00:17:54.680 position:56%
A Connecticut General, Israel Putnam
becomes his boss and he supplies,

00:17:54.680 --> 00:17:58.190
helps supply food to the
soldiers who are digging earth

00:17:58.190 --> 00:18:00.640
and forts around Cambridge.

00:18:00.640 --> 00:18:06.560
And then on the day of Bunker Hill
he hears firing in Charlestown.

00:18:06.560 --> 00:18:09.630
Israel Putnam rides
like crazy over there

00:18:09.630 --> 00:18:12.820
and the Battle of Bunker
Hill unfolds.

00:18:12.820 --> 00:18:15.810
Ben and his buddies go
up to Prospect Hill,

00:18:15.810 --> 00:18:19.260
a high hill that overlooks
Bunker Hill

00:18:19.260 --> 00:18:22.570
and Boston and watches the battle.

00:18:22.570 --> 00:18:23.940
It's an amazing scene.

00:18:23.940 --> 00:18:26.200
And this actually happened.

00:18:26.200 --> 00:18:30.890
And then his father eventually
escaped from Boston, finds Benjamin

00:18:30.890 --> 00:18:35.340
and apprentices -- he becomes
an apprentice to Isaiah Thomas,

00:18:35.340 --> 00:18:38.970
the newspaper man who is now
in Worcester, Massachusetts.

00:18:38.970 --> 00:18:41.540
Publishing the Massachusetts Spy,

00:18:41.540 --> 00:18:43.800
Benjamin Russell will
one day become one

00:18:43.800 --> 00:18:46.760
of the foremost newspaper
men in New England.

00:18:46.760 --> 00:18:49.090
But it all began in the
American Revolution.

00:18:49.090 --> 00:18:52.090
And I realized I have
to do a book about this.

00:18:52.090 --> 00:18:55.690
So I decided to go with
"Ben's Revolution".

00:18:55.690 --> 00:18:57.150
It tells his story.

00:18:57.150 --> 00:19:01.440
And it was a wonderful --
writing this book was so much fun.

00:19:01.440 --> 00:19:04.120
Trying to tell it to
young people and working

00:19:04.120 --> 00:19:06.940
with the incredible
artist Wendell Minor.

00:19:06.940 --> 00:19:08.740
And I want to -- I'm going to end

00:19:08.740 --> 00:19:12.730
by reading a passage
from "Bunker Hill" OK?

00:19:12.730 --> 00:19:15.210
Excuse me, from "Ben's Revolution".

00:19:15.210 --> 00:19:19.080
OK it's the winter of 1775.

00:19:19.080 --> 00:19:23.400
The British Soldiers
have arrived in Boston.

00:19:23.400 --> 00:19:26.390
There's tensions with
the Boston citizens.

00:19:26.390 --> 00:19:28.100
There's fighting in the streets.

00:19:28.100 --> 00:19:31.330
The boys are not happy that
there are British Soldiers.

00:19:31.330 --> 00:19:35.580
They go to the Boston Common, which
is still there if you go to Boston,

00:19:35.580 --> 00:19:38.820
where the British soldiers are
practicing their maneuvers.

00:19:38.820 --> 00:19:40.810
And they say, "Go home
you red coats!

00:19:40.810 --> 00:19:46.230
Go home!" Well that winter
a storm comes and Ben

00:19:46.230 --> 00:19:50.130
and his boys go sledding
and this is what happens.

00:19:50.130 --> 00:19:53.210
This chapter is called
"Boy's Rights".

00:19:53.210 --> 00:19:56.080
That January a storm
blew in from the North

00:19:56.080 --> 00:19:58.880
and blanketed Boston in snow.

00:19:58.880 --> 00:20:05.880
When classes were over at the
Queen Street Writing School,

00:20:05.880 --> 00:20:09.800
where Ben was a student, he and
his friends got their wooden sleds

00:20:09.800 --> 00:20:14.050
to go coasting down the
icy streets of Beacon Hill.

00:20:14.050 --> 00:20:16.250
They started near the
mansion owned by the merchant

00:20:16.250 --> 00:20:20.150
and patriot leader John
Hancock, pushing their sleds

00:20:20.150 --> 00:20:25.070 position:56%
across the rutted snow and ice until
they seemed to flying down the hill.

00:20:25.070 --> 00:20:28.270
Ben was leading the pack as
they rushed down School Street

00:20:28.270 --> 00:20:30.890
when suddenly his sled slowed down.

00:20:30.890 --> 00:20:34.190
Ben was outraged to discover
that ashes had been spread

00:20:34.190 --> 00:20:37.850
across the snow and ice to
make the street less slippery,

00:20:37.850 --> 00:20:42.120
by the British officer who
had moved into a nearby house.

00:20:42.120 --> 00:20:45.390
With several friends at his
side, Ben marched up the steps

00:20:45.390 --> 00:20:48.800
of the British officer's
house and rapped on the door.

00:20:48.800 --> 00:20:51.320 position:56%
The officer was soon at the doorway.

00:20:51.320 --> 00:20:53.330
Ben explained that for years this

00:20:53.330 --> 00:20:58.990
as the boys' favorite coasting
place, and now it was ruined.

00:20:58.990 --> 00:21:01.960
To Ben's surprise, the
officer ordered his servant

00:21:01.960 --> 00:21:04.350
to pour water over the ashes.

00:21:04.350 --> 00:21:09.170
Soon the water had frozen to ice,
and they were coasting once again.

00:21:09.170 --> 00:21:13.380
Ben had been taught to believer
that the soldiers were in Boston

00:21:13.380 --> 00:21:15.500
to take away his liberties.

00:21:15.500 --> 00:21:19.900
But this officer had proven
to be an understanding man.

00:21:19.900 --> 00:21:23.380
Later that night, the British
officer told General Gage

00:21:23.380 --> 00:21:26.610
about his encounter with
Ben and his friends.

00:21:26.610 --> 00:21:30.040
The general gave a weary sigh.

00:21:30.040 --> 00:21:33.740
"No wonder we are having so much
trouble with these Bostonians,"

00:21:33.740 --> 00:21:39.730
he said, "Even the children
insist on their rights."

00:21:39.730 --> 00:21:41.700
And it actually happened.

00:21:41.700 --> 00:21:44.250
You literally cannot
make this stuff up.

00:21:44.250 --> 00:21:48.200
And so I realized i just
had to tell Ben's story.

00:21:48.200 --> 00:21:55.290 position:56%
And so Ben would be involved with
this sledding incident and I'm going

00:21:55.290 --> 00:22:03.160
to end by reading when he learns of
the first shots of the revolution.

00:22:03.160 --> 00:22:06.790
On the morning of April 19th, 1775,

00:22:06.790 --> 00:22:09.450
Ben walked to the Queen
Street Writing School just

00:22:09.450 --> 00:22:10.750
as he did everyday.

00:22:10.750 --> 00:22:12.910
He and his friends were
sitting at their desks

00:22:12.910 --> 00:22:15.180
when they heard the
sound of a Fife and Drum

00:22:15.180 --> 00:22:17.290
on the street outside the school.

00:22:17.290 --> 00:22:21.020
Master James Carter sent a boy
to find out what was happening.

00:22:21.020 --> 00:22:24.010
He came back with amazing news.

00:22:24.010 --> 00:22:27.590
The previous night General Gage
had sent 500 British soldiers

00:22:27.590 --> 00:22:31.410 position:56%
on a secret mission to seize the
cannons that the patriots had hidden

00:22:31.410 --> 00:22:34.220
in Concord about 20 miles away.

00:22:34.220 --> 00:22:37.020
But the mission had not
remained a secret for long.

00:22:37.020 --> 00:22:41.450
By midnight, patriot riders like
Paul Revere, ever hear of him?

00:22:41.450 --> 00:22:45.150
And William Dawes were headed out
of Boston to alert the countryside

00:22:45.150 --> 00:22:47.420
that the British soldiers
were coming.

00:22:47.420 --> 00:22:51.610
Each town in Massachusetts had its
own militia made up of patriots

00:22:51.610 --> 00:22:54.060
who were willing to fight
for their families, farms,

00:22:54.060 --> 00:22:57.320
and freedom when the
alarm was spread thousands

00:22:57.320 --> 00:23:01.060
of them said goodbye to their wives
and children, took up their muskets

00:23:01.060 --> 00:23:03.720
and powder horns and
headed to Concord.

00:23:03.720 --> 00:23:06.140
But what the militiamen
have the courage to stand

00:23:06.140 --> 00:23:08.180
up to the British soldiers.

00:23:08.180 --> 00:23:11.160
At daybreak on the town
Green in Lexington,

00:23:11.160 --> 00:23:14.360
the patriots showed
they had courage.

00:23:14.360 --> 00:23:17.650
When the British soldiers charged
toward them the militiamen held

00:23:17.650 --> 00:23:18.950
their ground.

00:23:18.950 --> 00:23:22.990
The British fired their muskets
and eight militiamen were killed.

00:23:22.990 --> 00:23:26.840
When Ben and his schoolmates
heard this they were stunned.

00:23:26.840 --> 00:23:31.960 position:56%
After more than a year of mounting
tension people, ordinary people just

00:23:31.960 --> 00:23:35.840
like them had been shot
dead by British soldiers.

00:23:35.840 --> 00:23:39.360
It now seemed that as if all hope
of settling matters peacefully

00:23:39.360 --> 00:23:41.510
with the British were gone.

00:23:41.510 --> 00:23:43.970
Master Carter looked
at them with a solemn

00:23:43.970 --> 00:23:46.940
yet excited expression on his face.

00:23:46.940 --> 00:23:50.360
Boys, he said -- and this
is true he said this --

00:23:50.360 --> 00:23:56.830
"Boys, the wars begun
and you may run."

00:23:56.830 --> 00:24:02.750
And thus begins the
adventure of Benjamin Russell

00:24:02.750 --> 00:24:04.770
and the Battle of Bunker Hill.

00:24:04.770 --> 00:24:07.510
Thank you very much.

00:24:07.510 --> 00:24:10.040
[ Applause ]

00:24:10.040 --> 00:24:13.550

of the Library of Congress.
