00:00:00.530 --> 00:00:03.720
I told you in the last video
on calendar notation that,

00:00:03.720 --> 00:00:08.670
regardless of whether you're
using BC, AD or BCE and CE,

00:00:08.670 --> 00:00:13.660
that there is no year
0, that we had 1 BC.

00:00:13.660 --> 00:00:16.210
And then we had that
theoretical birth of Jesus,

00:00:16.210 --> 00:00:18.120
and most historians
don't think that he

00:00:18.120 --> 00:00:23.140
was born right exactly
on January 1, 1 AD.

00:00:23.140 --> 00:00:24.680
But there's no year 0.

00:00:24.680 --> 00:00:28.360
Right after that, you
go from December 31, 1

00:00:28.360 --> 00:00:31.920
BC, to January 1, 1 AD.

00:00:31.920 --> 00:00:33.690
There's no year 0.

00:00:33.690 --> 00:00:35.410
And despite the fact
that I emphasized

00:00:35.410 --> 00:00:39.030
that in the last video, I didn't
take that into consideration

00:00:39.030 --> 00:00:41.070
when I calculated
how many years there

00:00:41.070 --> 00:00:46.720
were between Plato's birth
and Columbus discovering

00:00:46.720 --> 00:00:47.730
the new world.

00:00:47.730 --> 00:00:50.380
And the reason why I didn't
take that into consideration

00:00:50.380 --> 00:00:52.700
is that the year
1492, whether you

00:00:52.700 --> 00:00:57.505
want to call it AD
1492, Anno Domini 1492.

00:00:57.505 --> 00:00:58.880
Whether you want
to call it that,

00:00:58.880 --> 00:01:01.780
or whether you want to call
it 1492 in the Common Era.

00:01:01.780 --> 00:01:07.177
It's not 1492 years since the
theoretical birth of Jesus,

00:01:07.177 --> 00:01:08.760
which we know is not
the actual birth.

00:01:08.760 --> 00:01:11.040
He was probably
born before that.

00:01:11.040 --> 00:01:15.890
It is 1,491 years since
the birth of Jesus.

00:01:15.890 --> 00:01:17.950
And to think about
it this way, let's

00:01:17.950 --> 00:01:19.890
just assume-- I'll
keep emphasizing,

00:01:19.890 --> 00:01:21.860
it's a theoretical date
that we're talking--

00:01:21.860 --> 00:01:24.630
or the theoretical event,
this kind of birth of Jesus

00:01:24.630 --> 00:01:27.570
that our calendars
revolve around.

00:01:27.570 --> 00:01:33.250
If we talk about January 1,
let's think about it this way.

00:01:33.250 --> 00:01:42.030
So January 1, 1
in the Common Era.

00:01:42.030 --> 00:01:45.140
How long is that since
the birth of Jesus?

00:01:45.140 --> 00:01:46.203
It's not one year.

00:01:46.203 --> 00:01:47.786
You wouldn't just
look at this and say

00:01:47.786 --> 00:01:50.620
it's been one year, because
this is theoretically

00:01:50.620 --> 00:01:52.450
the day that he was born.

00:01:52.450 --> 00:01:55.080
So this is zero years,
or almost zero years

00:01:55.080 --> 00:01:57.640
since that theoretical
birth of Jesus.

00:01:57.640 --> 00:02:04.920
Another way to think about it
is how long after January 1,

00:02:04.920 --> 00:02:09.700
the year 1 before
the Common Era--

00:02:09.700 --> 00:02:11.200
and I could've
called this AD, and I

00:02:11.200 --> 00:02:13.330
could've called this
BC-- what's the time

00:02:13.330 --> 00:02:15.530
difference between
these two dates?

00:02:15.530 --> 00:02:17.367
So the way I calculated
it before, I said,

00:02:17.367 --> 00:02:19.450
oh, this is one year after
that theoretical birth.

00:02:19.450 --> 00:02:20.130
That's wrong.

00:02:20.130 --> 00:02:22.320
This is during that
theoretical birth.

00:02:22.320 --> 00:02:24.560
But if I did it the way
I did in the last video,

00:02:24.560 --> 00:02:25.850
I would have said, oh,
that's one year after,

00:02:25.850 --> 00:02:26.460
one year before.

00:02:26.460 --> 00:02:28.335
You add them together,
and you would get two.

00:02:28.335 --> 00:02:31.390
But that's wrong because
there is no year 0.

00:02:31.390 --> 00:02:37.000
So January 1, 1 AD, or 1 in the
Common Era is right over here.

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:42.580
And then January 1, 1 BCE, is
exactly one year before that.

00:02:42.580 --> 00:02:45.907
So there's only one year,
one year difference.

00:02:45.907 --> 00:02:47.490
And the reason why
the math is strange

00:02:47.490 --> 00:02:50.240
is because there is no year 0.

00:02:50.240 --> 00:02:53.335
If there was a year 0, then my
calculation in the last video

00:02:53.335 --> 00:02:54.630
was correct.

00:02:54.630 --> 00:02:57.070
So really, the way that
you would calculate

00:02:57.070 --> 00:03:03.730
the time between Plato's birth
at 428 BC and Columbus sailing

00:03:03.730 --> 00:03:08.510
across the Atlantic in
1492, you would say, OK.

00:03:08.510 --> 00:03:13.400
This is 428 years before that
theoretical birth of Christ.

00:03:13.400 --> 00:03:18.380
But this isn't 1,492 years
after that theoretical birth.

00:03:18.380 --> 00:03:21.240
This is 1492 minus 1.

00:03:21.240 --> 00:03:23.610
So what you would do is you
would add these two numbers.

00:03:23.610 --> 00:03:25.490
This is 428 before.

00:03:25.490 --> 00:03:28.880
This is 1,492 minus
1 years after.

00:03:28.880 --> 00:03:31.120
So you would add them
and then subtract 1.

00:03:31.120 --> 00:03:34.830
So the correct answer-- so
this is the correction part--

00:03:34.830 --> 00:03:40.140
it isn't 1,920 years between
Plato's birth and Columbus.

00:03:40.140 --> 00:03:42.300
We want to subtract 1 from that.

00:03:42.300 --> 00:03:45.270
It is 1,920 minus 1 years.

00:03:45.270 --> 00:03:49.440
So that is 1,919 years.

00:03:49.440 --> 00:03:54.770
The same way that the difference
between 1 AD and 1 BCE,

00:03:54.770 --> 00:03:57.270
you could almost view it as
positive and negative numbers.

00:03:57.270 --> 00:03:59.470
You say, oh, this is
positive 1 minus negative 1.

00:03:59.470 --> 00:04:00.540
That would give me two.

00:04:00.540 --> 00:04:03.420
But there is no 0, so you would
need to subtract another 1.

00:04:03.420 --> 00:04:06.290
So this is exactly
1 year difference.

00:04:06.290 --> 00:04:07.800
So just want to clarify that.

00:04:07.800 --> 00:04:11.470
That's what that no
year 0 does to us.
