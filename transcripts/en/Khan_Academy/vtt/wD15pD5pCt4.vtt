00:00:00.570 --> 00:00:05.210
In the last video, we learned a
little bit about aldehydes.

00:00:05.210 --> 00:00:07.420
And we saw that they have the
general structure where you

00:00:07.420 --> 00:00:11.370
have a carbonyl group bonded to
some type of carbon chain,

00:00:11.370 --> 00:00:13.180
or I guess in the simplest form,
this could just be a

00:00:13.180 --> 00:00:16.170
hydrogen over here, and then
they definitely will have at

00:00:16.170 --> 00:00:19.760
least one hydrogen bonded to
the carbon in the carbonyl

00:00:19.760 --> 00:00:21.290
group, so this was
an aldehyde.

00:00:21.290 --> 00:00:26.610
Now, very closely related to
an aldehyde is a type of

00:00:26.610 --> 00:00:28.920
molecule called a ketone.

00:00:28.920 --> 00:00:31.380
And let's draw a couple of
ketones just to make things

00:00:31.380 --> 00:00:33.830
clear, and then we'll think
about what the difference is

00:00:33.830 --> 00:00:35.840
between a ketone and
an aldehyde.

00:00:35.840 --> 00:00:44.390
So this right here, CH3, CH3,
carbon right over here.

00:00:44.390 --> 00:00:47.240
This right here is a ketone.

00:00:47.240 --> 00:00:48.570
And you say, hey, Sal,
that looks very

00:00:48.570 --> 00:00:49.670
similar to an aldehyde.

00:00:49.670 --> 00:00:51.900
I have a carbonyl
group in both.

00:00:51.900 --> 00:00:53.830
So this right here is
a carbonyl group.

00:00:53.830 --> 00:00:55.800
This right here is
a carbonyl group.

00:00:55.800 --> 00:00:57.050
Let me write this: carbonyl.

00:00:59.390 --> 00:01:01.650
We have a carbonyl
group in both.

00:01:01.650 --> 00:01:04.280
We have a carbon chain
over here.

00:01:04.280 --> 00:01:06.110
This could be a general
carbon chain here.

00:01:06.110 --> 00:01:07.540
We have a methyl group.

00:01:07.540 --> 00:01:09.160
So how is this different?

00:01:09.160 --> 00:01:10.260
And I think you'll see.

00:01:10.260 --> 00:01:12.960
It's this part that I haven't
highlighted yet.

00:01:12.960 --> 00:01:14.740
In an aldehyde, there's
two ways to

00:01:14.740 --> 00:01:15.510
think about an aldehyde.

00:01:15.510 --> 00:01:18.250
You could either say that, look,
the carbonyl group is at

00:01:18.250 --> 00:01:19.810
the end of a carbon chain.

00:01:19.810 --> 00:01:22.070
So the next thing over is
going to be a hydrogen.

00:01:22.070 --> 00:01:25.590
Or you could say that in an
aldehyde, you have at least

00:01:25.590 --> 00:01:28.830
one hydrogen bonded to
the carbonyl carbon.

00:01:28.830 --> 00:01:32.050
And the way I remember that, so
you have a hydrogen there,

00:01:32.050 --> 00:01:33.360
and in the ketone you don't.

00:01:33.360 --> 00:01:36.880
The carbonyl group is embedded
in a carbon chain.

00:01:36.880 --> 00:01:40.700
It is bonded to-- at least it
is bonded to a carbon on

00:01:40.700 --> 00:01:45.050
either side, so over here
you have a carbon.

00:01:45.050 --> 00:01:46.890
And the way that I remember the
difference, and this is

00:01:46.890 --> 00:01:50.030
really just a little bit of a
mnemonic just to memorize it,

00:01:50.030 --> 00:01:54.780
is aldehyde has an "h" in it.

00:01:54.780 --> 00:01:57.970
There's an "h" right over there,
and an aldehyde has a

00:01:57.970 --> 00:02:00.710
hydrogen bonded to
this carbon.

00:02:00.710 --> 00:02:03.430
So now that we at least have a
reasonable understanding of

00:02:03.430 --> 00:02:05.480
what a ketone is, let's
name a few, just

00:02:05.480 --> 00:02:07.040
to familiarize ourselves.

00:02:07.040 --> 00:02:10.400
So this right here is the
simplest possible ketone.

00:02:10.400 --> 00:02:13.440
And it's called acetone, or
that's its common name.

00:02:16.320 --> 00:02:19.280
And actually, the word ketone
comes from the German word for

00:02:19.280 --> 00:02:21.550
acetone, which was I think
instead of a "c" there, they

00:02:21.550 --> 00:02:23.200
had a "k," so it's
like aketone.

00:02:23.200 --> 00:02:25.090
And they said, oh,
this is a ketone.

00:02:25.090 --> 00:02:26.290
So this is the common name.

00:02:26.290 --> 00:02:33.000
Another kind of traditional or
common way of naming a ketone

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:35.460
is to name each of these groups,
and it's kind of

00:02:35.460 --> 00:02:37.000
similar to the way that
we named ethers.

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:38.930
But instead of writing the
word ether at the end, we

00:02:38.930 --> 00:02:40.390
write the word ketone.

00:02:40.390 --> 00:02:42.460
So here we have a methyl group,
and we have another

00:02:42.460 --> 00:02:46.310
methyl group, so we have two
methyl groups right over here.

00:02:46.310 --> 00:02:47.560
So this would be dimethyl
ketone.

00:02:53.730 --> 00:02:57.450
This right here is
dimethyl ketone.

00:02:57.450 --> 00:03:00.470
And then if you wanted the
systematic way of naming it,

00:03:00.470 --> 00:03:03.600
you just look at the longest
carbon chain, which is one,

00:03:03.600 --> 00:03:07.860
two, three carbons,
so it's prop.

00:03:07.860 --> 00:03:12.100
Propa-, and instead of calling
it propane, we get rid of that

00:03:12.100 --> 00:03:13.950
"e" over there and we would
call it propanone.

00:03:16.690 --> 00:03:19.120
That tells us that this right
here is a ketone.

00:03:19.120 --> 00:03:21.060
And you have to know where
this double bond is.

00:03:21.060 --> 00:03:23.130
And actually, for propanone, you
don't have to specify it,

00:03:23.130 --> 00:03:25.490
because if you know it's a
ketone, you know that it has

00:03:25.490 --> 00:03:29.020
to have a carbon on either side
of the carbonyl group, so

00:03:29.020 --> 00:03:31.520
you actually don't even have
to specify where the

00:03:31.520 --> 00:03:32.940
carbonyl group is.

00:03:32.940 --> 00:03:35.120
But if you wanted to, you could
say, OK, that's going to

00:03:35.120 --> 00:03:36.790
be on the two carbon.

00:03:36.790 --> 00:03:39.160
No matter what direction you
start counting from, it's

00:03:39.160 --> 00:03:40.750
going to be on the two carbon.

00:03:40.750 --> 00:03:42.720
But the two is kind of optional
for propanone.

00:03:45.610 --> 00:03:46.850
Let's do a couple
of other ones.

00:03:46.850 --> 00:03:50.910
So let's say we had a molecule
that looks like this.

00:03:57.980 --> 00:04:01.030
So the traditional way of naming
it, you'd say, OK, on

00:04:01.030 --> 00:04:05.780
this end of the ketone, I have
one, two, three carbons.

00:04:05.780 --> 00:04:07.460
So on that end, I have
three carbons.

00:04:07.460 --> 00:04:08.843
That is a propyl group.

00:04:11.360 --> 00:04:14.580
And on this other side of the
ketone right over here, I have

00:04:14.580 --> 00:04:15.520
only one carbon.

00:04:15.520 --> 00:04:19.050
That is a methyl group.

00:04:19.050 --> 00:04:20.390
So then you would
just name them.

00:04:20.390 --> 00:04:25.650
And you name then in order
of increasing chain size,

00:04:25.650 --> 00:04:27.290
molecule size, or group size.

00:04:27.290 --> 00:04:30.610
So this one you'd write methyl
first. Methyl, because it's

00:04:30.610 --> 00:04:31.500
only one carbon.

00:04:31.500 --> 00:04:38.930
So this is methyl
propyl ketone.

00:04:42.740 --> 00:04:45.440
This is kind of the traditional
or the common way,

00:04:45.440 --> 00:04:48.500
often kind of the most used way,
of naming this molecule.

00:04:48.500 --> 00:04:50.660
But the systematic way of naming
it, you look at the

00:04:50.660 --> 00:04:54.590
longest carbon chain and you
say, OK, I have one, two,

00:04:54.590 --> 00:04:57.920
three, four, five carbons.

00:04:57.920 --> 00:04:59.470
So it's going to be pent-.

00:04:59.470 --> 00:05:02.630
And then you want to start
numbering it so that the

00:05:02.630 --> 00:05:05.585
carbonyl carbon has the lowest
possible number.

00:05:05.585 --> 00:05:08.920
So you want to start numbering
on the right side: one, two,

00:05:08.920 --> 00:05:12.080
three, four and five.

00:05:12.080 --> 00:05:15.440
So this right here, so we said
the prefix would be pent-.

00:05:15.440 --> 00:05:19.200
So it's penton, and instead of
saying it's pentane, you say

00:05:19.200 --> 00:05:20.450
it's pentanone.

00:05:23.560 --> 00:05:26.170
And to specify where the
carbonyl group is,

00:05:26.170 --> 00:05:27.570
you say it's 2.

00:05:27.570 --> 00:05:29.110
This is 2-pentanone.

00:05:29.110 --> 00:05:33.180
And you might also see
it written like this:

00:05:33.180 --> 00:05:34.430
pentan-2-one.

00:05:39.590 --> 00:05:43.880
Either one of these right here
would be acceptable.

00:05:43.880 --> 00:05:45.930
Let's do a slightly more
complicated example.

00:05:45.930 --> 00:05:48.650
Let's say we had something
that looked like this.

00:05:48.650 --> 00:05:52.400
So we have something,
a molecule,

00:05:52.400 --> 00:05:54.390
that looks like this.

00:05:54.390 --> 00:05:57.360
And let me stick some
chlorines over here.

00:05:57.360 --> 00:05:58.600
So what would this be?

00:05:58.600 --> 00:06:01.850
Well, our longest chain, once
again, is this cyclohexane:

00:06:01.850 --> 00:06:06.360
one, two, three, four,
five, six carbons.

00:06:06.360 --> 00:06:08.310
And I'll just name this
systematically right here.

00:06:08.310 --> 00:06:09.870
And the more complicated
things get, the more

00:06:09.870 --> 00:06:11.850
systematic people will
want to name it.

00:06:11.850 --> 00:06:14.360
So if we have six carbons right
here, and they're in a

00:06:14.360 --> 00:06:15.740
chain, so this is cyclohexane.

00:06:20.170 --> 00:06:23.970
You'd put the "e" there
if this carbonyl

00:06:23.970 --> 00:06:25.060
group wasn't there.

00:06:25.060 --> 00:06:30.300
But since it is, we would call
this cyclohexanone, So this

00:06:30.300 --> 00:06:34.360
right here tells us to name
it cyclohexanone.

00:06:34.360 --> 00:06:37.340
And then in a ring like this,
this would implicitly be the

00:06:37.340 --> 00:06:38.530
number one carbon.

00:06:38.530 --> 00:06:42.660
So if this is the number one
carbon and we want to number

00:06:42.660 --> 00:06:45.150
in the direction so that the
next groups have the lowest

00:06:45.150 --> 00:06:48.060
possible number, so we want to
make this the two carbon.

00:06:48.060 --> 00:06:49.310
So this is
2,2-dichlorocyclohexanone.

00:07:03.310 --> 00:07:04.825
Now, there's two more.

00:07:04.825 --> 00:07:07.590
And I'll just show these to you
because these tend to be

00:07:07.590 --> 00:07:09.170
referred to by their
common names.

00:07:09.170 --> 00:07:13.630
So I just want to show them to
you real fast. One is this

00:07:13.630 --> 00:07:16.580
molecule right here, where
we have a methyl group

00:07:16.580 --> 00:07:19.450
on this side: CH3.

00:07:19.450 --> 00:07:21.260
And over here, we have
a benzene ring.

00:07:26.740 --> 00:07:29.940
Now, that first super simple
ketone that we saw, we called

00:07:29.940 --> 00:07:31.440
this acetone.

00:07:31.440 --> 00:07:35.570
And so the common name here is
actually derived from acetone.

00:07:35.570 --> 00:07:37.630
Instead of calling it acetone,
because it doesn't have just a

00:07:37.630 --> 00:07:44.040
methyl group here, this is
called aceto-, and instead of

00:07:44.040 --> 00:07:49.170
acetone, it's acetophenone,
because we have this phenyl

00:07:49.170 --> 00:07:51.610
group, that benzene
ring right there.

00:07:51.610 --> 00:07:56.200
Acetophenone, which is a pretty
common molecule, and

00:07:56.200 --> 00:07:58.480
you'll see it referred
to this way.

00:07:58.480 --> 00:08:02.800
Now, the other one that you
might see every now and then,

00:08:02.800 --> 00:08:06.120
and I just want to expose it
to you, is a molecule that

00:08:06.120 --> 00:08:08.870
looks like this, that has
two benzene rings on it.

00:08:13.475 --> 00:08:15.840
It looks like that.

00:08:15.840 --> 00:08:17.305
And this is benzophenone.

00:08:22.780 --> 00:08:25.290
These last two I just really
wanted to expose you to their

00:08:25.290 --> 00:08:25.990
common names.

00:08:25.990 --> 00:08:28.700
But, in general, I think you
have a decent idea at this

00:08:28.700 --> 00:08:32.049
point of how to name at least
the simpler chains, either

00:08:32.049 --> 00:08:35.400
with the common names, for
example, propyl, or methyl

00:08:35.400 --> 00:08:39.059
propyl ketone, or 2-pentanone.

00:08:39.059 --> 00:08:40.690
And these are the more
typical or maybe the

00:08:40.690 --> 00:08:43.030
easier naming examples.
