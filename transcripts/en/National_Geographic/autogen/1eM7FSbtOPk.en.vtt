quite get round it but one of the good

00:11:19.440 --> 00:11:19.450
quite get round it but one of the good
 

00:11:19.450 --> 00:11:21.780
quite get round it but one of the good
things is that the breeze is picking up

00:11:21.780 --> 00:11:21.790
things is that the breeze is picking up
 

00:11:21.790 --> 00:11:24.570
things is that the breeze is picking up
on this stifling halti so it's given us

00:11:24.570 --> 00:11:24.580
on this stifling halti so it's given us
 

00:11:24.580 --> 00:11:26.850
on this stifling halti so it's given us
a little bit room to breathe and it also

00:11:26.850 --> 00:11:26.860
a little bit room to breathe and it also
 

00:11:26.860 --> 00:11:28.560
a little bit room to breathe and it also
does mean that it will start to get

00:11:28.560 --> 00:11:28.570
does mean that it will start to get
 

00:11:28.570 --> 00:11:31.290
does mean that it will start to get
cooler and the lioness will indeed start

00:11:31.290 --> 00:11:31.300
cooler and the lioness will indeed start
 

00:11:31.300 --> 00:11:33.600
cooler and the lioness will indeed start
moving at some point now just yesterday

rain in April but the trees as well they

00:33:03.220 --> 00:33:03.230
rain in April but the trees as well they
 

00:33:03.230 --> 00:33:05.050
rain in April but the trees as well they
will start losing their leaves as soon

00:33:05.050 --> 00:33:05.060
will start losing their leaves as soon
 

00:33:05.060 --> 00:33:07.480
will start losing their leaves as soon
as the daylight sorts of reaches are

00:33:07.480 --> 00:33:07.490
as the daylight sorts of reaches are
 

00:33:07.490 --> 00:33:10.060
as the daylight sorts of reaches are
certain there's like a daylight limit

00:33:10.060 --> 00:33:10.070
certain there's like a daylight limit
 

00:33:10.070 --> 00:33:11.770
certain there's like a daylight limit
that sort of happens and then a lot of

00:33:11.770 --> 00:33:11.780
that sort of happens and then a lot of
 

00:33:11.780 --> 00:33:13.180
that sort of happens and then a lot of
the trees will start losing their leaves

00:33:13.180 --> 00:33:13.190
the trees will start losing their leaves
 

00:33:13.190 --> 00:33:15.370
the trees will start losing their leaves
the trees that keep their leaves our

00:33:15.370 --> 00:33:15.380
the trees that keep their leaves our
 

00:33:15.380 --> 00:33:17.200

access to the water table so combination

00:33:21.010 --> 00:33:21.020
access to the water table so combination
 

00:33:21.020 --> 00:33:24.360
access to the water table so combination
of change in daylight hours as well as

00:33:24.360 --> 00:33:24.370
of change in daylight hours as well as
 

00:33:24.370 --> 00:33:28.470
of change in daylight hours as well as
change in water depth could potentially

00:33:28.470 --> 00:33:28.480
change in water depth could potentially
 

00:33:28.480 --> 00:33:30.240
change in water depth could potentially
lead to the trees losing their leaves so

00:33:30.240 --> 00:33:30.250
lead to the trees losing their leaves so
 

00:33:30.250 --> 00:33:32.340
lead to the trees losing their leaves so
when you do find trees with lots and

00:33:32.340 --> 00:33:32.350
when you do find trees with lots and
 

00:33:32.350 --> 00:33:33.810
when you do find trees with lots and
lots of leaves and them still very green

00:33:33.810 --> 00:33:33.820
lots of leaves and them still very green
 

00:33:33.820 --> 00:33:36.000
lots of leaves and them still very green
it's a very good chance that that plants

00:33:36.000 --> 00:33:36.010
it's a very good chance that that plants
 

00:33:36.010 --> 00:33:37.830
it's a very good chance that that plants
has got access to the water because

00:33:37.830 --> 00:33:37.840
has got access to the water because
 

00:33:37.840 --> 00:33:39.750
has got access to the water because
essentially if you keep your leaves on

00:33:39.750 --> 00:33:39.760
essentially if you keep your leaves on
 

00:33:39.760 --> 00:33:41.760
essentially if you keep your leaves on
that the leaves are a pump pulling water

00:33:41.760 --> 00:33:41.770
that the leaves are a pump pulling water
 

00:33:41.770 --> 00:33:43.890
that the leaves are a pump pulling water
from the bottom but if you don't have

00:33:43.890 --> 00:33:43.900
from the bottom but if you don't have
 

00:33:43.900 --> 00:33:46.080
from the bottom but if you don't have
water to pool then the leaves are

00:33:46.080 --> 00:33:46.090
water to pool then the leaves are
 

00:33:46.090 --> 00:33:48.419
water to pool then the leaves are
basically going to dry up and they're

00:33:48.419 --> 00:33:48.429
basically going to dry up and they're
 

00:33:48.429 --> 00:33:50.039
basically going to dry up and they're
going to cause damage to the plants

00:33:50.039 --> 00:33:50.049
going to cause damage to the plants
 

00:33:50.049 --> 00:33:51.390
going to cause damage to the plants
they're gonna start pulling water out of

00:33:51.390 --> 00:33:51.400
they're gonna start pulling water out of
 

00:33:51.400 --> 00:33:52.860
they're gonna start pulling water out of
the plant that it can't afford to lose

00:33:52.860 --> 00:33:52.870
the plant that it can't afford to lose
 

00:33:52.870 --> 00:33:55.980
the plant that it can't afford to lose
so if you've ever run a pump dry you can

00:33:55.980 --> 00:33:55.990
so if you've ever run a pump dry you can
 

00:33:55.990 --> 00:33:58.649
so if you've ever run a pump dry you can
do it's some serious serious damage and

00:33:58.649 --> 00:33:58.659
do it's some serious serious damage and
 

00:33:58.659 --> 00:34:00.630
do it's some serious serious damage and
so in trees don't want to lose any more

00:34:00.630 --> 00:34:00.640
so in trees don't want to lose any more
 

00:34:00.640 --> 00:34:03.570
so in trees don't want to lose any more
water and drop the leaves it's one of

00:34:03.570 --> 00:34:03.580
water and drop the leaves it's one of
 

00:34:03.580 --> 00:34:08.639
water and drop the leaves it's one of
the things that they're do art yeah okay

00:34:08.639 --> 00:34:08.649
the things that they're do art yeah okay

because they've all been fat and full

00:51:13.230 --> 00:51:13.240
because they've all been fat and full
 

00:51:13.240 --> 00:51:14.490

been feeding my resident I in a
population and so it would be good for

00:51:22.020 --> 00:51:22.030
population and so it would be good for
 

00:51:22.030 --> 00:51:23.970
population and so it would be good for

able to waste it into a tree for her to
 

00:51:27.850 --> 00:51:30.150
able to waste it into a tree for her to
be able to get some sort of food out of

be able to get some sort of food out of
 

00:51:30.160 --> 00:51:32.490
be able to get some sort of food out of
it at some point oh she's going to have

00:51:32.490 --> 00:51:32.500
it at some point oh she's going to have
 

00:51:32.500 --> 00:51:35.130
it at some point oh she's going to have
to learn what her brother learnt in the

scrap or something for the iana sleeve
 

00:51:38.770 --> 00:51:40.500
scrap or something for the iana sleeve
behind and in grab that and take it up a

00:51:40.500 --> 00:51:40.510
behind and in grab that and take it up a
 

00:51:40.510 --> 00:51:42.720
behind and in grab that and take it up a
tree the problem is is where it is at

00:51:42.720 --> 00:51:42.730
tree the problem is is where it is at
 

00:51:42.730 --> 00:51:45.420
tree the problem is is where it is at
the moment really is not anywhere near a

00:51:45.420 --> 00:51:45.430
the moment really is not anywhere near a
 

00:51:45.430 --> 00:51:48.060
the moment really is not anywhere near a
nice tree for her to hoist these are all

00:51:48.060 --> 00:51:48.070
nice tree for her to hoist these are all
 

00:51:48.070 --> 00:51:49.920
nice tree for her to hoist these are all
tiny little trees that are around her

00:51:49.920 --> 00:51:49.930
tiny little trees that are around her
 

00:51:49.930 --> 00:51:52.470
tiny little trees that are around her
and it's gonna be very difficult for her

00:51:52.470 --> 00:51:52.480
and it's gonna be very difficult for her
 

00:51:52.480 --> 00:51:54.690
and it's gonna be very difficult for her
to drag this really anyway I mean that

00:51:54.690 --> 00:51:54.700
to drag this really anyway I mean that
 

00:51:54.700 --> 00:51:56.550
to drag this really anyway I mean that

does almost double what she does
 

00:51:57.940 --> 00:52:00.030
does almost double what she does
actually if you think about it so she's

actually if you think about it so she's
 

00:52:00.040 --> 00:52:01.680
actually if you think about it so she's
got a lot of kind of work to do to be

00:52:01.680 --> 00:52:01.690
got a lot of kind of work to do to be
 

00:52:01.690 --> 00:52:03.240
got a lot of kind of work to do to be
able to actually move it she's eaten a

00:52:03.240 --> 00:52:03.250
able to actually move it she's eaten a
 

00:52:03.250 --> 00:52:03.750
able to actually move it she's eaten a
little bit

00:52:03.750 --> 00:52:03.760
little bit
 

00:52:03.760 --> 00:52:06.360
little bit
what's a huge amount as yet so I'm

00:52:06.360 --> 00:52:06.370
what's a huge amount as yet so I'm
 

00:52:06.370 --> 00:52:07.860
what's a huge amount as yet so I'm
hoping that at least tonight she'll get

a really good kind of feed out of it

00:52:10.830 --> 00:52:10.840
a really good kind of feed out of it
 

00:52:10.840 --> 00:52:12.900
a really good kind of feed out of it
before she sort of loses it if the

00:52:12.900 --> 00:52:12.910
before she sort of loses it if the
 

00:52:12.910 --> 00:52:15.480
before she sort of loses it if the
hyenas do come and they do sort of get

hyenas do come and they do sort of get
 

00:52:15.490 --> 00:52:17.640
hyenas do come and they do sort of get
to this point the other problem that

00:52:17.640 --> 00:52:17.650
to this point the other problem that
 

00:52:17.650 --> 00:52:19.680
to this point the other problem that
she's got unfortunately is that where we

00:52:19.680 --> 00:52:19.690
she's got unfortunately is that where we
 

00:52:19.690 --> 00:52:21.780
she's got unfortunately is that where we
situated is right next to a road we

00:52:21.780 --> 00:52:21.790
situated is right next to a road we
 

00:52:21.790 --> 00:52:25.860
situated is right next to a road we
within I don't know 15 metres of a road

00:52:25.860 --> 00:52:25.870
within I don't know 15 metres of a road
 

00:52:25.870 --> 00:52:27.960
within I don't know 15 metres of a road
and we know that the heiner's like to

00:52:27.960 --> 00:52:27.970
and we know that the heiner's like to
 

00:52:27.970 --> 00:52:30.720
and we know that the heiner's like to
use roads as they move around in the

00:52:30.720 --> 00:52:30.730
use roads as they move around in the
 

00:52:30.730 --> 00:52:33.900
use roads as they move around in the
sort of um in the evenings so they're

00:52:33.900 --> 00:52:33.910
sort of um in the evenings so they're
 

00:52:33.910 --> 00:52:35.340
sort of um in the evenings so they're
gonna come up and down these roads and

00:52:35.340 --> 00:52:35.350
gonna come up and down these roads and
 

00:52:35.350 --> 00:52:36.750
gonna come up and down these roads and
for them they going to be able to spot

00:52:36.750 --> 00:52:36.760
for them they going to be able to spot
 

00:52:36.760 --> 00:52:38.760
for them they going to be able to spot
that really quickly you can see kind of

00:52:38.760 --> 00:52:38.770
that really quickly you can see kind of
 

00:52:38.770 --> 00:52:40.140
that really quickly you can see kind of
where the road is behind me so this is

00:52:40.140 --> 00:52:40.150
where the road is behind me so this is
 

00:52:40.150 --> 00:52:42.210
where the road is behind me so this is
the road that runs and oh is it hyenas

00:52:42.210 --> 00:52:42.220
the road that runs and oh is it hyenas
 

00:52:42.220 --> 00:52:43.500
the road that runs and oh is it hyenas
are gonna move around from here given

00:52:43.500 --> 00:52:43.510
are gonna move around from here given

and there's another dam straight up this
road on baffles hook so it's kind of a

00:52:48.660 --> 00:52:48.670
road on baffles hook so it's kind of a
 

00:52:48.670 --> 00:52:51.060
road on baffles hook so it's kind of a

along here and the chances of her being
able to actually keep that is gonna be

00:52:54.600 --> 00:52:54.610
able to actually keep that is gonna be
 

00:52:54.610 --> 00:52:56.250
able to actually keep that is gonna be
quite slim but I'm super impressed I

00:52:56.250 --> 00:52:56.260
quite slim but I'm super impressed I

people and they stand taller than a
 

00:55:49.710 --> 00:55:52.160
people and they stand taller than a
human but obviously it's difficult to

00:55:52.160 --> 00:55:52.170
human but obviously it's difficult to
 

00:55:52.170 --> 00:55:54.320

the skin you see she's just broken

01:13:46.950 --> 01:13:46.960
the skin you see she's just broken
 

01:13:46.960 --> 01:13:48.959
the skin you see she's just broken
through the skin now and to start

01:13:48.959 --> 01:13:48.969
through the skin now and to start
 

01:13:48.969 --> 01:13:50.750
through the skin now and to start
feeding on the meats over the rib areas

01:13:50.750 --> 01:13:50.760
feeding on the meats over the rib areas
 

01:13:50.760 --> 01:13:53.040
feeding on the meats over the rib areas
and what you'll find is she's going to

01:13:53.040 --> 01:13:53.050
and what you'll find is she's going to
 

01:13:53.050 --> 01:13:54.899
and what you'll find is she's going to
open that kind of cavity arts and so

01:13:54.899 --> 01:13:54.909
open that kind of cavity arts and so
 

01:13:54.909 --> 01:13:57.359
open that kind of cavity arts and so
she's eating is a sort of membrane that

01:13:57.359 --> 01:13:57.369
she's eating is a sort of membrane that
 

01:13:57.369 --> 01:13:59.339
she's eating is a sort of membrane that
runs between the skin and the meat and

01:13:59.339 --> 01:13:59.349
runs between the skin and the meat and
 

01:13:59.349 --> 01:14:01.200
runs between the skin and the meat and
then there's a sort of Bailey section

01:14:01.200 --> 01:14:01.210
then there's a sort of Bailey section
 

01:14:01.210 --> 01:14:03.029
then there's a sort of Bailey section
and once she opens that she can then

01:14:03.029 --> 01:14:03.039
and once she opens that she can then
 

01:14:03.039 --> 01:14:05.399
and once she opens that she can then
start to pull out that stomach area and

01:14:05.399 --> 01:14:05.409
start to pull out that stomach area and
 

01:14:05.409 --> 01:14:06.990
start to pull out that stomach area and
get rid of all of that stomach content

01:14:06.990 --> 01:14:07.000
get rid of all of that stomach content
 

01:14:07.000 --> 01:14:09.060
get rid of all of that stomach content
which will be fermenting heavily inside

01:14:09.060 --> 01:14:09.070
which will be fermenting heavily inside
 

01:14:09.070 --> 01:14:11.069
which will be fermenting heavily inside
then starting to expand and swell and

01:14:11.069 --> 01:14:11.079
then starting to expand and swell and
 

01:14:11.079 --> 01:14:13.020
then starting to expand and swell and
then she can kind of get rid of that and

01:14:13.020 --> 01:14:13.030
then she can kind of get rid of that and
 

01:14:13.030 --> 01:14:15.209
then she can kind of get rid of that and
get to the choice so two organs inside

01:14:15.209 --> 01:14:15.219
get to the choice so two organs inside
 

01:14:15.219 --> 01:14:17.010
get to the choice so two organs inside
there and this is very common to see a

01:14:17.010 --> 01:14:17.020
there and this is very common to see a
 

01:14:17.020 --> 01:14:18.569
there and this is very common to see a
leopard start like this where they kind

01:14:18.569 --> 01:14:18.579
leopard start like this where they kind
 

01:14:18.579 --> 01:14:20.370
leopard start like this where they kind
of open up a flap along the rib section

01:14:20.370 --> 01:14:20.380
of open up a flap along the rib section
 

01:14:20.380 --> 01:14:22.319
of open up a flap along the rib section
and the belly area and then they kind of

01:14:22.319 --> 01:14:22.329
and the belly area and then they kind of
 

01:14:22.329 --> 01:14:24.270
and the belly area and then they kind of
go down towards between the legs and she

01:14:24.270 --> 01:14:24.280
go down towards between the legs and she
 

01:14:24.280 --> 01:14:26.700
go down towards between the legs and she
has actually eaten from the ramp already

01:14:26.700 --> 01:14:26.710
has actually eaten from the ramp already
 

01:14:26.710 --> 01:14:28.229
has actually eaten from the ramp already
it's difficult to see the way that she

01:14:28.229 --> 01:14:28.239
it's difficult to see the way that she
 

01:14:28.239 --> 01:14:29.940
it's difficult to see the way that she
is at the moment but

01:14:29.940 --> 01:14:29.950
is at the moment but
 

01:14:29.950 --> 01:14:31.590
is at the moment but
there's a little section of the ramp the

01:14:31.590 --> 01:14:31.600
there's a little section of the ramp the
 

01:14:31.600 --> 01:14:33.240
there's a little section of the ramp the
tail area where she's actually eaten

01:14:33.240 --> 01:14:33.250
tail area where she's actually eaten
 

01:14:33.250 --> 01:14:36.270
tail area where she's actually eaten
away at some of that now so I think

01:14:36.270 --> 01:14:36.280
away at some of that now so I think
 

01:14:36.280 --> 01:14:37.590
away at some of that now so I think
she's just trying to create a hole and

01:14:37.590 --> 01:14:37.600
she's just trying to create a hole and
 

01:14:37.600 --> 01:14:39.540
she's just trying to create a hole and
then try and kind of get rid of any of

01:14:39.540 --> 01:14:39.550
then try and kind of get rid of any of
 

01:14:39.550 --> 01:14:42.600
then try and kind of get rid of any of
those internal organs which is it smells

01:14:42.600 --> 01:14:42.610
those internal organs which is it smells
 

01:14:42.610 --> 01:14:45.480
those internal organs which is it smells
good and sometimes they also just like

01:14:45.480 --> 01:14:45.490
good and sometimes they also just like
 

01:14:45.490 --> 01:14:48.540
good and sometimes they also just like
to eat a certain section and they they

01:14:48.540 --> 01:14:48.550
to eat a certain section and they they
 

01:14:48.550 --> 01:14:50.400
to eat a certain section and they they
go for it from there might find she's

01:14:50.400 --> 01:14:50.410
go for it from there might find she's
 

01:14:50.410 --> 01:14:52.710
go for it from there might find she's
also struggling a little bit to move the

01:14:52.710 --> 01:14:52.720
also struggling a little bit to move the
 

01:14:52.720 --> 01:14:54.240
also struggling a little bit to move the
carcass around and so this is just the

01:14:54.240 --> 01:14:54.250
carcass around and so this is just the
 

01:14:54.250 --> 01:14:56.430
carcass around and so this is just the
easiest spot for her to be able to

01:14:56.430 --> 01:14:56.440
easiest spot for her to be able to
 

01:14:56.440 --> 01:14:58.230
easiest spot for her to be able to
actually feed and put in sort of

01:14:58.230 --> 01:14:58.240
actually feed and put in sort of
 

01:14:58.240 --> 01:15:01.470
actually feed and put in sort of
sustenance in and that means that you

01:15:01.470 --> 01:15:01.480
sustenance in and that means that you
 

01:15:01.480 --> 01:15:03.390
sustenance in and that means that you
know she's able to actually kind of get

01:15:03.390 --> 01:15:03.400
know she's able to actually kind of get
 

01:15:03.400 --> 01:15:05.070
know she's able to actually kind of get
some food from there rather than

01:15:05.070 --> 01:15:05.080
some food from there rather than
 

01:15:05.080 --> 01:15:06.960
some food from there rather than
fighting was trying to roll the carcass

01:15:06.960 --> 01:15:06.970
fighting was trying to roll the carcass
 

01:15:06.970 --> 01:15:08.610
fighting was trying to roll the carcass
and get between the legs and all those

01:15:08.610 --> 01:15:08.620
and get between the legs and all those
 

01:15:08.620 --> 01:15:10.860
and get between the legs and all those
kind of things if she wanted to feed off

01:15:10.860 --> 01:15:10.870
kind of things if she wanted to feed off
 

01:15:10.870 --> 01:15:15.000
kind of things if she wanted to feed off
the sort of rump area what she could

01:15:15.000 --> 01:15:15.010
the sort of rump area what she could
 

01:15:15.010 --> 01:15:16.530
the sort of rump area what she could
just be in that kind of mood where she

01:15:16.530 --> 01:15:16.540
just be in that kind of mood where she
 

01:15:16.540 --> 01:15:21.630
just be in that kind of mood where she
just feels like ribs you never know it's

01:15:21.630 --> 01:15:21.640
just feels like ribs you never know it's
 

01:15:21.640 --> 01:15:23.190
just feels like ribs you never know it's

they might find she'll go after a few of
 

01:29:58.060 --> 01:30:00.300
they might find she'll go after a few of
those organs now I think though she's

01:30:00.300 --> 01:30:00.310
those organs now I think though she's
 

01:30:00.310 --> 01:30:02.580
those organs now I think though she's
more trying to open it further so that

01:30:02.580 --> 01:30:02.590
more trying to open it further so that
 

01:30:02.590 --> 01:30:04.020

it's easier to actually get rid of all

01:30:04.020 --> 01:30:04.030
it's easier to actually get rid of all
 

01:30:04.030 --> 01:30:05.580
it's easier to actually get rid of all
of that stuff and then you'll find that

01:30:05.580 --> 01:30:05.590
of that stuff and then you'll find that
 

01:30:05.590 --> 01:30:07.470
of that stuff and then you'll find that
they start to eat the sort of kidneys

01:30:07.470 --> 01:30:07.480
they start to eat the sort of kidneys
 

01:30:07.480 --> 01:30:10.140
they start to eat the sort of kidneys

we'll see if she actually gets tucked

01:30:14.100 --> 01:30:14.110
we'll see if she actually gets tucked
 

01:30:14.110 --> 01:30:16.200
we'll see if she actually gets tucked
into those and it's amazing to watch

01:30:16.200 --> 01:30:16.210
into those and it's amazing to watch
 

01:30:16.210 --> 01:30:17.939
into those and it's amazing to watch

one of those proud to moments that you

one of those proud to moments that you
have when you've been watching a lipid

for quite some time and you always think
 

01:31:08.579 --> 01:31:10.129

what's the biggest animal she can kill

01:31:10.129 --> 01:31:10.139
what's the biggest animal she can kill

we've got of her bringing down a fully

we've got of her bringing down a fully
 

01:31:17.010 --> 01:31:18.259
we've got of her bringing down a fully
grown male Impala I don't think we've

01:31:18.259 --> 01:31:18.269
grown male Impala I don't think we've
 

01:31:18.269 --> 01:31:19.520
grown male Impala I don't think we've
seen her feeding on a fully grown male

01:31:19.520 --> 01:31:19.530
seen her feeding on a fully grown male
 

01:31:19.530 --> 01:31:20.479
seen her feeding on a fully grown male
Impala by herself

01:31:20.479 --> 01:31:20.489
Impala by herself
 

01:31:20.489 --> 01:31:21.799
Impala by herself
have we I know we've seen her with a

01:31:21.799 --> 01:31:21.809
have we I know we've seen her with a
 

01:31:21.809 --> 01:31:23.509
have we I know we've seen her with a
fully grown female Impala when she was

01:31:23.509 --> 01:31:23.519
fully grown female Impala when she was
 

01:31:23.519 --> 01:31:25.819
fully grown female Impala when she was
quite young which we thought maybe died

01:31:25.819 --> 01:31:25.829
quite young which we thought maybe died
 

01:31:25.829 --> 01:31:28.189
quite young which we thought maybe died
of natural causes but this as far as I

01:31:28.189 --> 01:31:28.199
of natural causes but this as far as I
 

01:31:28.199 --> 01:31:29.359
of natural causes but this as far as I
know is the first fully grown male

01:31:29.359 --> 01:31:29.369
know is the first fully grown male
 

01:31:29.369 --> 01:31:31.390
know is the first fully grown male
Impala we found her with by herself

01:31:31.390 --> 01:31:31.400
Impala we found her with by herself
 

01:31:31.400 --> 01:31:38.859
Impala we found her with by herself
might be mistaken but I think it is

01:31:38.859 --> 01:31:38.869
 
 

01:31:38.869 --> 01:31:41.299

worrying about it independence is over

01:31:43.459 --> 01:31:43.469
worrying about it independence is over
 

01:31:43.469 --> 01:31:46.279
worrying about it independence is over
well not necessarily and the reason why

01:31:46.279 --> 01:31:46.289
well not necessarily and the reason why
 

01:31:46.289 --> 01:31:47.870
well not necessarily and the reason why
is that she's still young I mean she's

01:31:47.870 --> 01:31:47.880
is that she's still young I mean she's
 

01:31:47.880 --> 01:31:49.549
is that she's still young I mean she's
not a territorial individual she's still

01:31:49.549 --> 01:31:49.559
not a territorial individual she's still
 

01:31:49.559 --> 01:31:51.680
not a territorial individual she's still
got a lot of kind of work to do until

01:31:51.680 --> 01:31:51.690
got a lot of kind of work to do until
 

01:31:51.690 --> 01:31:53.959
got a lot of kind of work to do until
she becomes territorial but from a point

01:31:53.959 --> 01:31:53.969
she becomes territorial but from a point
 

01:31:53.969 --> 01:31:55.819
she becomes territorial but from a point
of view of feeding herself yes we can

01:31:55.819 --> 01:31:55.829
of view of feeding herself yes we can
 

01:31:55.829 --> 01:31:57.439
of view of feeding herself yes we can
stop worrying now I'm pretty sure she's

01:31:57.439 --> 01:31:57.449
stop worrying now I'm pretty sure she's
 

01:31:57.449 --> 01:31:59.569
stop worrying now I'm pretty sure she's
more than capable of feeding herself

01:31:59.569 --> 01:31:59.579
more than capable of feeding herself
 

01:31:59.579 --> 01:32:01.430
more than capable of feeding herself
sure you know she's hardly been with

01:32:01.430 --> 01:32:01.440
sure you know she's hardly been with
 

01:32:01.440 --> 01:32:02.959
sure you know she's hardly been with
tandy over the course of the last two

01:32:02.959 --> 01:32:02.969
tandy over the course of the last two
 

01:32:02.969 --> 01:32:05.330
tandy over the course of the last two
three months and she's absolutely in

01:32:05.330 --> 01:32:05.340
three months and she's absolutely in
 

01:32:05.340 --> 01:32:07.129
three months and she's absolutely in
perfect condition so I don't think we

01:32:07.129 --> 01:32:07.139
perfect condition so I don't think we
 

01:32:07.139 --> 01:32:08.390
perfect condition so I don't think we
need to worry about her from that

01:32:08.390 --> 01:32:08.400
need to worry about her from that
 

01:32:08.400 --> 01:32:10.640
need to worry about her from that
standpoint but she still got a long road

01:32:10.640 --> 01:32:10.650
standpoint but she still got a long road
 

01:32:10.650 --> 01:32:13.509
standpoint but she still got a long road
from the standpoint of intruding males

01:32:13.509 --> 01:32:13.519
from the standpoint of intruding males
 

01:32:13.519 --> 01:32:16.430
from the standpoint of intruding males
females and her carving out her in

01:32:16.430 --> 01:32:16.440
females and her carving out her in
 

01:32:16.440 --> 01:32:18.560
females and her carving out her in
territorial space in order to become a

01:32:18.560 --> 01:32:18.570
territorial space in order to become a
 

01:32:18.570 --> 01:32:20.209
territorial space in order to become a
successful adult lipid and that will

01:32:20.209 --> 01:32:20.219
successful adult lipid and that will
 

01:32:20.219 --> 01:32:22.399
successful adult lipid and that will
only really show in in a year's time

01:32:22.399 --> 01:32:22.409
only really show in in a year's time
 

01:32:22.409 --> 01:32:24.469
only really show in in a year's time
when she reaches sort of two and a half

01:32:24.469 --> 01:32:24.479
when she reaches sort of two and a half
 

01:32:24.479 --> 01:32:26.239
when she reaches sort of two and a half
three and she's starting to actually

01:32:26.239 --> 01:32:26.249
three and she's starting to actually
 

01:32:26.249 --> 01:32:27.859
three and she's starting to actually
mate and those kind of things then we'll

01:32:27.859 --> 01:32:27.869
mate and those kind of things then we'll
 

01:32:27.869 --> 01:32:29.870
mate and those kind of things then we'll
have seen her really kind of get through

01:32:29.870 --> 01:32:29.880
have seen her really kind of get through
 

01:32:29.880 --> 01:32:30.979
have seen her really kind of get through
it and then we don't have to worry

01:32:30.979 --> 01:32:30.989
it and then we don't have to worry
 

01:32:30.989 --> 01:32:33.830
it and then we don't have to worry
nearly as much but of course any lipid

01:32:33.830 --> 01:32:33.840
nearly as much but of course any lipid
 

01:32:33.840 --> 01:32:36.109
nearly as much but of course any lipid
is some worry throughout their life that

01:32:36.109 --> 01:32:36.119
is some worry throughout their life that
 

01:32:36.119 --> 01:32:37.969
is some worry throughout their life that
they get sort of caught by lions or

01:32:37.969 --> 01:32:37.979
they get sort of caught by lions or
 

01:32:37.979 --> 01:32:39.229
they get sort of caught by lions or
these kind of things I mean we know it

01:32:39.229 --> 01:32:39.239
these kind of things I mean we know it
 

01:32:39.239 --> 01:32:42.259
these kind of things I mean we know it
happens one of her brothers in fact was

01:32:42.259 --> 01:32:42.269
happens one of her brothers in fact was
 

01:32:42.269 --> 01:32:44.209
happens one of her brothers in fact was
caught by lions when he was about four

01:32:44.209 --> 01:32:44.219
caught by lions when he was about four
 

01:32:44.219 --> 01:32:47.600
caught by lions when he was about four
years old so he you know was already at

01:32:47.600 --> 01:32:47.610
years old so he you know was already at
 

01:32:47.610 --> 01:32:48.770
years old so he you know was already at
that point where he was completely

01:32:48.770 --> 01:32:48.780
that point where he was completely
 

01:32:48.780 --> 01:32:50.209
that point where he was completely
independent and looking after himself

01:32:50.209 --> 01:32:50.219
independent and looking after himself
 

01:32:50.219 --> 01:32:52.700
independent and looking after himself
but you know these things can happen so

01:32:52.700 --> 01:32:52.710
but you know these things can happen so
 

01:32:52.710 --> 01:32:54.830
but you know these things can happen so
it's a little while to go for elemental

01:32:54.830 --> 01:32:54.840
it's a little while to go for elemental
 

01:32:54.840 --> 01:32:58.100
it's a little while to go for elemental
we can be kind of rest easy in the

01:32:58.100 --> 01:32:58.110
we can be kind of rest easy in the
 

01:32:58.110 --> 01:32:59.860
we can be kind of rest easy in the
knowledge that she's

01:32:59.860 --> 01:32:59.870
knowledge that she's
 

01:32:59.870 --> 01:33:03.040
knowledge that she's
completely okay and managed to and I've

01:33:03.040 --> 01:33:03.050
completely okay and managed to and I've
 

01:33:03.050 --> 01:33:04.360
completely okay and managed to and I've
sought to sell fat

01:33:04.360 --> 01:33:04.370
sought to sell fat
 

01:33:04.370 --> 01:33:05.560
sought to sell fat
now do you need to jump on the radio

01:33:05.560 --> 01:33:05.570
now do you need to jump on the radio
 

01:33:05.570 --> 01:33:07.960

that that we would have probably found

01:53:04.050 --> 01:53:04.060
that that we would have probably found
 

01:53:04.060 --> 01:53:06.630

01:53:11.070 --> 01:53:11.080
plausible theory and the last time I saw
 

01:53:11.080 --> 01:53:11.910
plausible theory and the last time I saw
her she was day

01:53:11.910 --> 01:53:11.920
her she was day
 

01:53:11.920 --> 01:53:14.669
her she was day
definitely very very big whether that

01:53:14.669 --> 01:53:14.679
definitely very very big whether that
 

01:53:14.679 --> 01:53:15.990
definitely very very big whether that
means that she was pregnant or just very

01:53:15.990 --> 01:53:16.000

haven't seen her properly yes or briefly
 

01:53:25.000 --> 01:53:26.580
haven't seen her properly yes or briefly
the other day but I mean seen her and

spend lots of time with her this year
 

01:53:28.090 --> 01:53:30.630
spend lots of time with her this year
really so I would love for her to kind

01:53:30.630 --> 01:53:30.640
really so I would love for her to kind
 

01:53:30.640 --> 01:53:32.280
really so I would love for her to kind
of show up wouldn't it be nice if she

01:53:32.280 --> 01:53:32.290
of show up wouldn't it be nice if she
 

01:53:32.290 --> 01:53:33.870

showed up this evening that would be

01:53:33.870 --> 01:53:33.880
showed up this evening that would be
 

01:53:33.880 --> 01:53:36.300
showed up this evening that would be
quite cool to see if she kind of is

01:53:36.300 --> 01:53:36.310
quite cool to see if she kind of is
 

01:53:36.310 --> 01:53:38.970
quite cool to see if she kind of is
pregnant or she's you know still looking

for a mate be an interesting kind of

01:53:41.000 --> 01:53:41.010
for a mate be an interesting kind of
 

01:53:41.010 --> 01:53:44.130
for a mate be an interesting kind of
scenario unfortunately they were

01:53:44.130 --> 01:53:44.140
scenario unfortunately they were
 

01:53:44.140 --> 01:53:45.209
scenario unfortunately they were
probably gonna have to leave the

01:53:45.209 --> 01:53:45.219
probably gonna have to leave the
 

01:53:45.219 --> 01:53:48.479
probably gonna have to leave the
sighting for a little bit and there's

01:53:48.479 --> 01:53:48.489
sighting for a little bit and there's
 

01:53:48.489 --> 01:53:49.680
sighting for a little bit and there's
quite a few other cars that do you want

01:53:49.680 --> 01:53:49.690
quite a few other cars that do you want
 

01:53:49.690 --> 01:53:51.510
quite a few other cars that do you want
to come here to us now so we're more

01:53:51.510 --> 01:53:51.520
to come here to us now so we're more
 

01:53:51.520 --> 01:53:52.919
to come here to us now so we're more
than likely gonna have to make a bit of

01:53:52.919 --> 01:53:52.929
than likely gonna have to make a bit of
 

01:53:52.929 --> 01:53:54.959
than likely gonna have to make a bit of
space just now but was it you for a

01:53:54.959 --> 01:53:54.969
space just now but was it you for a
 

01:53:54.969 --> 01:53:56.160
space just now but was it you for a
little while longer James you say

01:53:56.160 --> 01:53:56.170
little while longer James you say
 

01:53:56.170 --> 01:53:59.520
little while longer James you say
crossing fingers yes and no in some

01:53:59.520 --> 01:53:59.530
crossing fingers yes and no in some
 

01:53:59.530 --> 01:54:01.140
crossing fingers yes and no in some
respects because if she has deigned and

01:54:01.140 --> 01:54:01.150
respects because if she has deigned and
 

01:54:01.150 --> 01:54:03.150
respects because if she has deigned and
then she's keeping it very quiet which

01:54:03.150 --> 01:54:03.160
then she's keeping it very quiet which
 

01:54:03.160 --> 01:54:05.189
then she's keeping it very quiet which
is gonna make life ice a tricky we're

01:54:05.189 --> 01:54:05.199
is gonna make life ice a tricky we're
 

01:54:05.199 --> 01:54:06.780
is gonna make life ice a tricky we're
not gonna be able to at the stage we

01:54:06.780 --> 01:54:06.790
not gonna be able to at the stage we
 

01:54:06.790 --> 01:54:09.150
not gonna be able to at the stage we
don't have any idea where she's using so

01:54:09.150 --> 01:54:09.160
don't have any idea where she's using so
 

01:54:09.160 --> 01:54:10.470
don't have any idea where she's using so
it'll be a kind of a few months of

01:54:10.470 --> 01:54:10.480
it'll be a kind of a few months of
 

01:54:10.480 --> 01:54:13.140
it'll be a kind of a few months of
having to try and find her the best

01:54:13.140 --> 01:54:13.150
having to try and find her the best
 

01:54:13.150 --> 01:54:14.400
having to try and find her the best
thing that we can hope for is that she

01:54:14.400 --> 01:54:14.410
thing that we can hope for is that she
 

01:54:14.410 --> 01:54:15.900
thing that we can hope for is that she
has a kill somewhere where she can spin

01:54:15.900 --> 01:54:15.910
has a kill somewhere where she can spin
 

01:54:15.910 --> 01:54:17.790
has a kill somewhere where she can spin
sort of two three days and we can

01:54:17.790 --> 01:54:17.800
sort of two three days and we can
 

01:54:17.800 --> 01:54:19.590
sort of two three days and we can
monitor movements because that always

01:54:19.590 --> 01:54:19.600
monitor movements because that always
 

01:54:19.600 --> 01:54:21.090
monitor movements because that always
gives it away immediately if they have a

01:54:21.090 --> 01:54:21.100
gives it away immediately if they have a
 

01:54:21.100 --> 01:54:23.729
gives it away immediately if they have a
kill big kill and she moves from it and

01:54:23.729 --> 01:54:23.739
kill big kill and she moves from it and
 

01:54:23.739 --> 01:54:25.140
kill big kill and she moves from it and
kind of goes back and forth thing we

01:54:25.140 --> 01:54:25.150
kind of goes back and forth thing we
 

01:54:25.150 --> 01:54:27.060
kind of goes back and forth thing we
know definitely that she's got to the

01:54:27.060 --> 01:54:27.070
know definitely that she's got to the
 

01:54:27.070 --> 01:54:28.470
know definitely that she's got to the
ones or we can at least see if she's

01:54:28.470 --> 01:54:28.480
ones or we can at least see if she's
 

01:54:28.480 --> 01:54:30.600
ones or we can at least see if she's
really massively full and if she's

01:54:30.600 --> 01:54:30.610
really massively full and if she's
 

01:54:30.610 --> 01:54:32.120
really massively full and if she's
starting to lactate - anything like that

01:54:32.120 --> 01:54:32.130
starting to lactate - anything like that
 

01:54:32.130 --> 01:54:34.560
starting to lactate - anything like that
that's what our best chance is I just

01:54:34.560 --> 01:54:34.570
that's what our best chance is I just
 

01:54:34.570 --> 01:54:35.880
that's what our best chance is I just
hope that she hasn't given birth on

01:54:35.880 --> 01:54:35.890
hope that she hasn't given birth on
 

01:54:35.890 --> 01:54:37.290
hope that she hasn't given birth on
torture would I say that even though I

01:54:37.290 --> 01:54:37.300
torture would I say that even though I
 

01:54:37.300 --> 01:54:38.880
torture would I say that even though I
know we have access to tortured but our

01:54:38.880 --> 01:54:38.890
know we have access to tortured but our
 

01:54:38.890 --> 01:54:40.229
know we have access to tortured but our
signal there at the moment is just so

01:54:40.229 --> 01:54:40.239
signal there at the moment is just so
 

01:54:40.239 --> 01:54:42.510
signal there at the moment is just so
poor with all the vegetation that it's

01:54:42.510 --> 01:54:42.520
poor with all the vegetation that it's
 

01:54:42.520 --> 01:54:44.310
poor with all the vegetation that it's
very difficult for us to go into any

01:54:44.310 --> 01:54:44.320
very difficult for us to go into any
 

01:54:44.320 --> 01:54:45.900

places that Tandy likes to walk there

01:54:45.900 --> 01:54:45.910
places that Tandy likes to walk there
 

01:54:45.910 --> 01:54:48.330
places that Tandy likes to walk there
she likes certain drainage lines that we

01:54:48.330 --> 01:54:48.340
she likes certain drainage lines that we
 

01:54:48.340 --> 01:54:50.130
she likes certain drainage lines that we
get zero signal at and so I hope that

01:54:50.130 --> 01:54:50.140
get zero signal at and so I hope that
 

01:54:50.140 --> 01:54:51.780
get zero signal at and so I hope that
she's not dealing in that side because

01:54:51.780 --> 01:54:51.790
she's not dealing in that side because
 

01:54:51.790 --> 01:54:53.669
she's not dealing in that side because
it would be a bit of a shame if we don't

01:54:53.669 --> 01:54:53.679
it would be a bit of a shame if we don't
 

01:54:53.679 --> 01:54:56.189
it would be a bit of a shame if we don't
get the same ability to watch her grow

01:54:56.189 --> 01:54:56.199
get the same ability to watch her grow
 

01:54:56.199 --> 01:54:58.110
get the same ability to watch her grow

conclusive proof that it is her Azrael
 

03:04:43.561 --> 03:04:46.100

so santoku Mary's DNA off as well which

03:04:46.100 --> 03:04:46.110
so santoku Mary's DNA off as well which
 

03:04:46.110 --> 03:04:48.230
so santoku Mary's DNA off as well which
is good news it will at least be in the

03:04:48.230 --> 03:04:48.240
is good news it will at least be in the
 

03:04:48.240 --> 03:04:49.520
is good news it will at least be in the
library and will be interesting to see

03:04:49.520 --> 03:04:49.530
library and will be interesting to see
 

03:04:49.530 --> 03:04:52.310
