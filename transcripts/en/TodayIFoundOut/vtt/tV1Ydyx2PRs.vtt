00:00:00.170 --> 00:00:11.599
Ever wonder where the expression “sleep
tight and don’t let the bed bugs bite”

00:00:11.599 --> 00:00:12.870
comes from?

00:00:12.870 --> 00:00:16.960
Well, wonder no more.

00:00:16.960 --> 00:00:22.240
Let’s start with the bug of it all: the
bed bug, or its scientific name- Cimex lectularius.

00:00:22.240 --> 00:00:27.500
It’s generally accepted that the bed bug
started its feast on humans around 10,000

00:00:27.500 --> 00:00:28.500
years ago.

00:00:28.500 --> 00:00:32.289
Before this, they are thought to have fed
off of other warm-blooded animals who liked

00:00:32.289 --> 00:00:35.079
living in dark, cool places like caves.

00:00:35.079 --> 00:00:39.769
But then around 8,000 BC, the bed bugs moved
onto their next meal.

00:00:39.769 --> 00:00:43.929
Humans are (mostly) hairless and make an easy
target for a bed bug.

00:00:43.929 --> 00:00:48.010
Further, according to a theory proposed at
New Mexico State University’s College of

00:00:48.010 --> 00:00:52.940
Agricultural Sciences, the jump likely happened
because many humans around this time were

00:00:52.940 --> 00:00:57.850
sleeping on sheets made of dried grass that
were covered in animal skins- an easy hiding

00:00:57.850 --> 00:01:02.339
spot for the bugs and one which virtually
guaranteed a regular food source.

00:01:02.339 --> 00:01:05.070
Bed bugs have been biting humans ever since.

00:01:05.070 --> 00:01:09.759
For instance, archaeologists have found fossilized
bed bugs in human dwellings in Egypt dating

00:01:09.759 --> 00:01:13.070
back about 3,550 years ago.

00:01:13.070 --> 00:01:16.810
The ancient Greek playwright Aristophanes
wrote about them in two of his plays.

00:01:16.810 --> 00:01:18.939
They are spoken of in the Jewish Talmud.

00:01:18.939 --> 00:01:24.210
Even Roman philosopher Pliny wrote about bed
bugs in his 77 AD work The Natural History,

00:01:24.210 --> 00:01:28.799
saying that their bites could heal snakebites,
ear infections, and other blood ailments (or

00:01:28.799 --> 00:01:33.009
perceived to be blood ailments) by sucking
out the bad blood.

00:01:33.009 --> 00:01:37.159
Bed bugs are usually associated with places
that are generally kept somewhat less than

00:01:37.159 --> 00:01:38.219
clean.

00:01:38.219 --> 00:01:42.610
While this isn’t always the case, it certainly
was when people began traveling from one place

00:01:42.610 --> 00:01:43.610
to next.

00:01:43.610 --> 00:01:47.569
Most relevant to the "sleep tight" saying,
bed bugs thrived in America with the advent

00:01:47.569 --> 00:01:49.109
of the railroad.

00:01:49.109 --> 00:01:54.119
The motels and inns near the railroads would
be visited by countless travelers, some cleaner

00:01:54.119 --> 00:01:55.119
than others.

00:01:55.119 --> 00:01:59.710
As Robert Snetsinger, a professor emeritus
of entomology at Penn State University, puts

00:01:59.710 --> 00:02:05.549
it, these inns were “distribution centers
for the spread of bed bugs to homes.”

00:02:05.549 --> 00:02:07.530
This brings us to the saying itself.

00:02:07.530 --> 00:02:12.510
There are a couple of different popular speculative
theories out there concerning this, and one

00:02:12.510 --> 00:02:14.420
much more reasonable one.

00:02:14.420 --> 00:02:18.470
For starters, one rather interesting theory
relates to how some beds were made during

00:02:18.470 --> 00:02:21.049
the 18th and early 19th centuries.

00:02:21.049 --> 00:02:26.349
The theory goes that in some cases, beds were
supported by ropes tied in a weave, a predecessor

00:02:26.349 --> 00:02:27.400
to the box-spring.

00:02:27.400 --> 00:02:30.560
In order for it to support the mattresses,
the ropes needed to be pulled tight.

00:02:30.560 --> 00:02:35.150
If they were loose, the mattress would sag,
leaving the bed occupant with an uncomfortable

00:02:35.150 --> 00:02:36.150
night’s sleep.

00:02:36.150 --> 00:02:40.150
In fact, one reference even refers to how
if a guest had overstayed their welcome, the

00:02:40.150 --> 00:02:44.481
hosts would loosen the ropes under the mattress
as a passive-aggressive way of telling the

00:02:44.481 --> 00:02:46.100
guests to go on their way.

00:02:46.100 --> 00:02:49.769
Another theory is that since people sometimes
slept in long john pajamas back then, it was

00:02:49.769 --> 00:02:54.610
always advised to make sure your nightgown
was tied and buttoned tight, to make sure

00:02:54.610 --> 00:02:56.349
the bed bugs didn’t get in.

00:02:56.349 --> 00:03:01.280
The accuracy of either of these notions aside,
it turns out there is a slightly more mundane

00:03:01.280 --> 00:03:03.930
origin for why it's "sleep tight."

00:03:03.930 --> 00:03:08.530
Specifically, as noted by the Oxford English
Dictionary, among others, "tight's" adverb

00:03:08.530 --> 00:03:12.260
is “tightly,” which, at the time, was
just another word for “soundly.”

00:03:12.260 --> 00:03:16.799
So, essentially, “to sleep tight” just
meant “to sleep soundly,” or "to sleep

00:03:16.799 --> 00:03:17.799
well."

00:03:17.799 --> 00:03:21.439
The first known usage of something like “sleep
tight, don’t let the bedbugs bite” dates

00:03:21.439 --> 00:03:24.599
to 1881, though the word “bed” is left
out.

00:03:24.599 --> 00:03:30.130
In the book Boscobel: The Novel by Emma M.
Newton, a nurse tells children “Good night,

00:03:30.130 --> 00:03:31.130
sleep tight.

00:03:31.130 --> 00:03:32.709
And don’t let the buggers bite.”

00:03:32.709 --> 00:03:35.959
In this case, “buggers” could mean other
bugs (mosquitoes, spiders, etc.), but the

00:03:35.959 --> 00:03:36.959
sentiment is the same.

00:03:36.959 --> 00:03:41.840
Next, in the 1884 work Boating Trips on the
New England River by Henry Parker Fellows,

00:03:41.840 --> 00:03:47.069
a little girl tells boaters that she hopes
they “may sleep tight, where the bugs don’t

00:03:47.069 --> 00:03:48.069
bite.”

00:03:48.069 --> 00:03:51.819
This also seems to be a reference to mosquitoes
since they are on a river.

00:03:51.819 --> 00:03:57.799
Finally, in 1897 we find the exact phrase
in a usage book called What they Say in New

00:03:57.799 --> 00:04:01.549
England: A Book of Signs, Sayings, and Superstitions.

00:04:01.549 --> 00:04:05.680
It explains what a boy in New England would
say to a companion as they part for the evening

00:04:05.680 --> 00:04:09.620
- “Goodnight, sleep tight, don’t let the
bedbugs bite."

00:04:09.620 --> 00:04:10.930
Bonus Fact:

00:04:10.930 --> 00:04:15.519
Bed bugs reproduce via the male bed bug literally
stabbing the female in the abdomen with its

00:04:15.519 --> 00:04:19.980
hypodermic genitalia, rather than using the
female's reproductive tract.

00:04:19.980 --> 00:04:24.350
Once he's stabbed the female, he then releases
his sperm insider her body cavity.

00:04:24.350 --> 00:04:28.820
The sperm ultimately travel via the female's
blood to sperm storage structures in her body.

00:04:28.820 --> 00:04:33.050
The males also are perfectly happy to do the
same to other males, with their sexual attraction

00:04:33.050 --> 00:04:35.970
to one another primarily based on the size
of the bed bug.

00:04:35.970 --> 00:04:41.850
So if you're a well fed bed bug, male or female,
expect to have males trying to stab you with

00:04:41.850 --> 00:04:43.030
their genitalia.

00:04:43.030 --> 00:04:47.100
However, there is a pheromone the male bed
bugs may emit to try to ward off potential

00:04:47.100 --> 00:04:59.420
stabbers (and predators), consisting of (E)-2-octenal
and (E)-2-hexenal.
