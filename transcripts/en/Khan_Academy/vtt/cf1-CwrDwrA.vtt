00:00:00.516 --> 00:00:02.523
Keita left camp three days ago

00:00:02.523 --> 00:00:04.188
on a journey into the jungle.

00:00:04.188 --> 00:00:06.436
The three days of his
journey can be described

00:00:06.436 --> 00:00:10.308
by displacement, distance
and direction vectors,

00:00:10.308 --> 00:00:12.807
or displacement vectors,

00:00:12.807 --> 00:00:15.343
and displacement is
distance with the direction,

00:00:15.343 --> 00:00:17.632
and the vectors are d1, d2, and d3.

00:00:17.632 --> 00:00:19.015
They list them right over here.

00:00:19.015 --> 00:00:20.648
The distances are given in kilometers.

00:00:20.648 --> 00:00:24.048
How far is Keita from camp
at the end of day three?

00:00:24.048 --> 00:00:26.126
So let's just think
about what is happening.

00:00:26.126 --> 00:00:28.715
On day one, let's say this
is his starting point.

00:00:28.715 --> 00:00:32.331
His displacement, he starts
here and he goes there,

00:00:32.331 --> 00:00:34.252
but if you break it down based on,

00:00:34.252 --> 00:00:38.208
I guess if you call this direction

00:00:38.208 --> 00:00:39.628
Let me draw a little compass here.

00:00:39.628 --> 00:00:41.405
If you say that this is north,

00:00:41.405 --> 00:00:43.845
this is east,

00:00:43.845 --> 00:00:46.389
this is west, and that this is south,

00:00:46.389 --> 00:00:48.014
you can break it down by how much

00:00:48.014 --> 00:00:49.741
he went in the east direction

00:00:49.741 --> 00:00:51.766
and how much he went
in the north direction.

00:00:51.766 --> 00:00:54.734
So this is saying he went
seven in the east direction.

00:00:54.734 --> 00:00:58.153
One, two, three, four, five, six, seven.

00:00:58.153 --> 00:00:59.570
Seven in the east direction,

00:00:59.570 --> 00:01:01.666
and he went eight in the north direction.

00:01:01.666 --> 00:01:05.578
One, two, three, four,
five, six, seven, eight.

00:01:05.578 --> 00:01:07.146
Just like that.

00:01:07.146 --> 00:01:09.314
This is seven and this is eight.

00:01:09.314 --> 00:01:15.954
Then on day two, he went six units,

00:01:15.954 --> 00:01:17.100
I guess these are kilometers,

00:01:17.100 --> 00:01:18.922
six kilometers to the east,

00:01:18.922 --> 00:01:21.707
one, two, three, four, five, six,

00:01:21.707 --> 00:01:25.322
and he went two kilometers
to the north, one, two.

00:01:25.322 --> 00:01:28.403
So he ends up right over here.

00:01:28.403 --> 00:01:30.556
Six and two, and then finally day three,

00:01:30.556 --> 00:01:33.721
the component of his displacement

00:01:33.721 --> 00:01:36.890
that is to the east is two,

00:01:36.890 --> 00:01:38.843
and the component of his displacement

00:01:38.843 --> 00:01:42.837
that is to the north is nine.

00:01:42.837 --> 00:01:45.588
And so to figure out
how far he is from camp

00:01:45.588 --> 00:01:47.531
at the end of day three,
we just have to figure out

00:01:47.531 --> 00:01:49.275
what is his total displacement?

00:01:49.275 --> 00:01:51.204
What is the length of the vector

00:01:51.204 --> 00:01:53.732
that is the sum of all of these?

00:01:53.732 --> 00:01:57.963
So what is the length of
this vector right over here?

00:01:57.963 --> 00:02:01.949
Let's call this d sub t for total,

00:02:01.949 --> 00:02:01.977
displacement d sub t for total.

00:02:01.977 --> 00:02:04.097
Displacement total, total displacement.

00:02:04.097 --> 00:02:06.344
And you can see how this is arranged,

00:02:06.344 --> 00:02:08.824
that our total displacement
vector is just going

00:02:08.824 --> 00:02:11.058
to be the sum of d1,

00:02:11.058 --> 00:02:13.537
let me do those in the appropriate colors.

00:02:13.537 --> 00:02:25.233
It's just going to be the
sum of d1, d2, and d3.

00:02:25.617 --> 00:02:26.683
And if you're summing these vectors,

00:02:26.683 --> 00:02:28.434
you can just add the
corresponding component.

00:02:28.434 --> 00:02:33.034
So for example, the total
displacement is going to be equal

00:02:33.034 --> 00:02:35.258
to the sum of the horizontal,

00:02:35.258 --> 00:02:38.401
I should say the displacement
in the east direction.

00:02:38.401 --> 00:02:49.718
So it's going to be
seven plus six plus two,

00:02:49.888 --> 00:02:54.079
and then in the north direction you have

00:02:54.079 --> 00:03:02.345
eight plus six, or sorry,
eight plus two plus nine.

00:03:02.698 --> 00:03:04.420
And so our total displacement vector

00:03:04.420 --> 00:03:06.269
if we were to write it in this form,

00:03:06.269 --> 00:03:08.996
is going to be, this is 13 plus two,

00:03:08.996 --> 00:03:11.509
so it's going to be 15 to the east,

00:03:11.509 --> 00:03:13.733
or the component of displacement

00:03:13.733 --> 00:03:15.540
in the eastern direction is 15,

00:03:15.540 --> 00:03:18.582
and in the northern direction
is 10 plus nine, 19.

00:03:18.582 --> 00:03:21.805
So that's this vector right over here.

00:03:21.805 --> 00:03:26.308
It's 15, it's component in the east is 15,

00:03:26.308 --> 00:03:30.778
and to the north is 19.

00:03:30.916 --> 00:03:32.383
Let me make that clear.

00:03:32.383 --> 00:03:34.704
So this distance right over here,

00:03:34.704 --> 00:03:38.624
or if I were to make this
a triangle the length

00:03:38.624 --> 00:03:40.944
of this side of the triangle here is 19

00:03:40.944 --> 00:03:46.521
and that's his total displacement
in the northern direction,

00:03:46.521 --> 00:03:47.695
and his total displacement

00:03:47.695 --> 00:03:57.111
in the eastern direction is that 15.

00:03:57.326 --> 00:03:59.488
So what's going to be the length
of our displacement vector

00:03:59.488 --> 00:04:01.809
or what's the magnitude of
our displacement vector?

00:04:01.809 --> 00:04:05.258
The magnitude of our
total displacement is,

00:04:05.258 --> 00:04:06.969
well it's the Pythagorean theorem.

00:04:06.969 --> 00:04:07.954
This is a right triangle.

00:04:07.954 --> 00:04:09.552
15 squared plus 19 squared is going

00:04:09.552 --> 00:04:11.089
to be the magnitude squared.

00:04:11.089 --> 00:04:12.945
Or we could say that
the magnitude is equal

00:04:12.945 --> 00:04:18.185
to the square root of 15
squared plus 19 squared,

00:04:18.185 --> 00:04:21.218
plus 19 squared.

00:04:21.218 --> 00:04:23.402
So let me get my calculator out.

00:04:23.402 --> 00:04:25.241
All right, so I have the square root

00:04:25.241 --> 00:04:32.561
of 15 squared plus 19 squared gives, 24,

00:04:32.561 --> 00:04:35.018
let's see, they want us to
round to the nearest tenth,

00:04:35.018 --> 00:04:37.240
24 point two.

00:04:37.240 --> 00:04:39.897
So 24 point two kilometers.

00:04:39.897 --> 00:04:41.281
Then they say what direction is Keita

00:04:41.281 --> 00:04:43.329
from camp at the end of day three?

00:04:43.329 --> 00:04:44.490
Round to the nearest degree.

00:04:44.490 --> 00:04:46.994
Your answer should be
between zero and 180 degrees.

00:04:46.994 --> 00:04:50.386
So distance I'm assuming, this
would just be the convention,

00:04:50.386 --> 00:04:51.938
they should be a little bit more precise

00:04:51.938 --> 00:04:53.123
here in their wording

00:04:53.123 --> 00:04:54.313
or a little bit less ambiguous.

00:04:54.313 --> 00:04:57.905
The convention is, the angle relative to,

00:04:57.905 --> 00:05:00.305
if we were thinking of
the coordinate axes,

00:05:00.305 --> 00:05:01.778
the positive X axis,

00:05:01.778 --> 00:05:04.057
on this you could say
the eastern direction,

00:05:04.057 --> 00:05:07.073
so it's really this angle right over here,

00:05:07.073 --> 00:05:08.281
let's call that theta.

00:05:08.281 --> 00:05:09.800
How could we figure out what theta is?

00:05:09.800 --> 00:05:11.535
It's part of this right triangle.

00:05:11.535 --> 00:05:13.128
We know this side has length 19

00:05:13.128 --> 00:05:14.903
and we know this side has 15.

00:05:14.903 --> 00:05:16.936
So we know the opposite side theta

00:05:16.936 --> 00:05:18.519
and we know the adjacent side theta,

00:05:18.519 --> 00:05:21.559
so what trig function involves
opposite and adjacent?

00:05:21.559 --> 00:05:25.336
Well tangent involves
opposite and adjacent,

00:05:25.336 --> 00:05:31.992
so we could write that
the tangent of theta is

00:05:31.992 --> 00:05:34.183
equal to 19 over 15,

00:05:34.183 --> 00:05:41.529
is equal to opposite over
adjacent, 19 over 15,

00:05:41.529 --> 00:05:43.768
and to solve for theta we can just say,

00:05:43.768 --> 00:05:46.436
now we've got to make sure that our angle,

00:05:46.436 --> 00:05:48.333
if we just take the inverse tangent here,

00:05:48.333 --> 00:05:50.486
is actually the angle we're looking for,

00:05:50.486 --> 00:05:52.565
but inverse tangent, the convention is,

00:05:52.565 --> 00:05:54.014
it will give you an angle that is

00:05:54.014 --> 00:05:57.150
between negative pi over two and pi,

00:05:57.150 --> 00:05:58.092
if we're thinking in radiants,

00:05:58.092 --> 00:05:59.370
but since we're thinking in degrees,

00:05:59.370 --> 00:05:59.766
it'll give you an angle

00:05:59.766 --> 00:06:02.120
between negative 90
degrees and 90 degrees,

00:06:02.120 --> 00:06:04.032
and this angle is clearly in that.

00:06:04.032 --> 00:06:07.256
It's actually between zero and 90 degrees.

00:06:07.256 --> 00:06:08.800
So when we take inverse tangent,

00:06:08.800 --> 00:06:10.728
we know that we're going
to get the right angle.

00:06:10.728 --> 00:06:12.336
Otherwise we would have
to make some adjustments.

00:06:12.336 --> 00:06:14.231
So theta is going to be equal

00:06:14.231 --> 00:06:21.520
to the inverse tangent of 19 over 15,

00:06:21.582 --> 00:06:24.713
which is equal to, let's
get our calculator out,

00:06:24.713 --> 00:06:26.322
let's make sure that we are in,

00:06:26.322 --> 00:06:28.026
yep we are in degree mode,

00:06:28.026 --> 00:06:36.330
and so let's take the inverse
tangent of 19 divided by 15,

00:06:36.330 --> 00:06:38.281
which is equal, let's see they want us

00:06:38.281 --> 00:06:39.610
to round to the nearest degree,

00:06:39.610 --> 00:06:43.393
so 52 degrees if we round
to the nearest degree.

00:06:43.393 --> 00:06:47.601
52 degrees, which also looks
right, right over here.

00:06:47.601 --> 00:06:50.377
This looks like a little bit
more than a 45 degree angle,

00:06:50.377 --> 00:06:53.017
which 52 degrees seems to fit the bill,

00:06:53.017 --> 00:06:54.892
and we are done.
