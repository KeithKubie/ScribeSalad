00:00:13.160 --> 00:00:15.760
I'm the product
of a bold leadership decision.

00:00:16.920 --> 00:00:20.896
After 1956, when Tunisia
became independent,

00:00:20.920 --> 00:00:23.656
our first president, Habib Bourguiba,

00:00:23.680 --> 00:00:27.536
decided to invest 20 percent
of the country's national budget

00:00:27.560 --> 00:00:29.136
in education.

00:00:29.160 --> 00:00:30.736
Yes, 20 percent,

00:00:30.760 --> 00:00:33.920
on the high end of the spectrum
even by today's standards.

00:00:34.480 --> 00:00:36.376
Some people protested.

00:00:36.400 --> 00:00:38.096
What about infrastructure?

00:00:38.120 --> 00:00:41.136
What about electricity,
roads and running water?

00:00:41.160 --> 00:00:42.520
Are these not important?

00:00:44.159 --> 00:00:45.616
I would argue

00:00:45.640 --> 00:00:49.320
that the most important
infrastructure we have are minds,

00:00:50.360 --> 00:00:51.640
educated minds.

00:00:53.280 --> 00:00:59.496
President Bourguiba helped establish
free, high-quality education

00:00:59.520 --> 00:01:01.840
for every boy and every girl.

00:01:03.760 --> 00:01:06.816
And together with millions
of other Tunisians,

00:01:06.840 --> 00:01:09.360
I'm deeply indebted
to that historic decision.

00:01:10.040 --> 00:01:12.160
And that's what brought me here today,

00:01:13.280 --> 00:01:17.200
because today, we are facing
a global learning crisis.

00:01:17.840 --> 00:01:21.176
I call it learning crisis
and not education crisis,

00:01:21.200 --> 00:01:24.136
because on top of
the quarter of a billion children

00:01:24.160 --> 00:01:25.760
who are out of school today,

00:01:26.800 --> 00:01:30.856
even more, 330 million children,

00:01:30.880 --> 00:01:33.680
are in school but failing to learn.

00:01:35.760 --> 00:01:37.576
And if we do nothing,

00:01:37.600 --> 00:01:39.256
if nothing changes,

00:01:39.280 --> 00:01:43.256
by 2030, just 13 years from now,

00:01:43.280 --> 00:01:46.816
half of the world's children and youth,

00:01:46.840 --> 00:01:50.896
half of 1.6 billion children and youth,

00:01:50.920 --> 00:01:53.760
will be either out of school
or failing to learn.

00:01:58.240 --> 00:02:02.056
So two years ago,
I joined the Education Commission.

00:02:02.080 --> 00:02:05.816
It's a commission brought together
by former UK Prime Minister

00:02:05.840 --> 00:02:08.760
and UN Special Envoy
for Global Education Gordon Brown.

00:02:09.960 --> 00:02:12.016
Our first task was to find out:

00:02:12.040 --> 00:02:13.696
How big is the learning crisis?

00:02:13.720 --> 00:02:15.680
What's actually the scope of the problem?

00:02:16.840 --> 00:02:18.296
Today we know:

00:02:18.320 --> 00:02:21.496
half of the world's children by 2030

00:02:21.520 --> 00:02:22.840
will be failing to learn.

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:25.936
And that's how actually we discovered

00:02:25.960 --> 00:02:30.656
that we need to change the world's focus
from schooling to learning,

00:02:30.680 --> 00:02:33.416
from just counting
how many bodies are in classrooms

00:02:33.440 --> 00:02:35.120
to actually how many are learning.

00:02:36.320 --> 00:02:38.320
And the second big task was,

00:02:39.520 --> 00:02:40.960
can we do anything about this?

00:02:41.760 --> 00:02:45.176
Can we do anything
about this big, vast, silent,

00:02:45.200 --> 00:02:48.080
maybe most-neglected international crisis?

00:02:48.640 --> 00:02:51.816
And what we found out is, we can.

00:02:51.840 --> 00:02:53.400
It's actually amazing.

00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:56.176
We can, for the first time,

00:02:56.200 --> 00:02:59.816
have every child in school and learning

00:02:59.840 --> 00:03:02.200
within just one generation.

00:03:03.840 --> 00:03:06.640
And we don't even have to really
invent the wheel to do so.

00:03:07.600 --> 00:03:10.736
We just need to learn
from the best in class,

00:03:10.760 --> 00:03:13.056
but not any best in class --

00:03:13.080 --> 00:03:14.880
the best in your own class.

00:03:16.200 --> 00:03:19.936
What we did is actually
we looked at countries by income level:

00:03:19.960 --> 00:03:22.696
low-income, mid-income, high-income.

00:03:22.720 --> 00:03:26.960
We looked at what the 25 percent
fastest improvers in education do,

00:03:27.760 --> 00:03:29.656
and what we found out is

00:03:29.680 --> 00:03:34.176
that if every country moves
at the same rate as the fastest improvers

00:03:34.200 --> 00:03:36.656
within their own income level,

00:03:36.680 --> 00:03:39.056
then within just one generation

00:03:39.080 --> 00:03:41.760
we can have every child
in school and learning.

00:03:43.880 --> 00:03:45.976
Let me give you an example.

00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:47.936
Let's take Tunisia for example.

00:03:47.960 --> 00:03:51.736
We're not telling Tunisia,
"You should move as fast as Finland."

00:03:51.760 --> 00:03:53.696
No disrespect, Finland.

00:03:53.720 --> 00:03:55.096
We're telling Tunisia,

00:03:55.120 --> 00:03:56.456
"Look at Vietnam."

00:03:56.480 --> 00:04:00.816
They spend similar amounts
for primary and secondary pupils

00:04:00.840 --> 00:04:03.136
as percentage of GDP per capita,

00:04:03.160 --> 00:04:05.000
but achieves today higher results.

00:04:06.440 --> 00:04:10.320
Vietnam introduced a standardized
assessment for literacy and numeracy,

00:04:11.120 --> 00:04:15.856
teachers in Vietnam are better monitored
than in other developing countries,

00:04:15.880 --> 00:04:18.480
and students' achievements
are made public.

00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:21.520
And it shows in the results.

00:04:22.160 --> 00:04:24.096
In the 2015 PISA --

00:04:24.120 --> 00:04:26.776
Program for International
Student Assessment --

00:04:26.800 --> 00:04:29.616
Vietnam outperformed
many wealthy economies,

00:04:29.640 --> 00:04:31.519
including the United States.

00:04:33.680 --> 00:04:36.696
Now, if you're not an education expert,

00:04:36.720 --> 00:04:38.656
you may ask, "What's new and different?

00:04:38.680 --> 00:04:43.120
Don't all countries track student progress
and make those achievements public?"

00:04:44.040 --> 00:04:46.976
No. The sad answer is no.

00:04:47.000 --> 00:04:48.560
We are very far from it.

00:04:49.400 --> 00:04:51.896
Only half of the developing countries

00:04:51.920 --> 00:04:54.936
have systematic learning assessment
at primary school,

00:04:54.960 --> 00:04:57.880
and even less so
at lower secondary school.

00:04:59.080 --> 00:05:02.336
So if we don't know

00:05:02.360 --> 00:05:04.056
if children are learning,

00:05:04.080 --> 00:05:08.016
how are teachers supposed to focus
their attention on delivering results,

00:05:08.040 --> 00:05:11.616
and how are countries supposed
to prioritize education spending

00:05:11.640 --> 00:05:13.136
actually to delivering results,

00:05:13.160 --> 00:05:15.240
if they don't know
if children are learning?

00:05:16.600 --> 00:05:20.456
That's why the first big transformation

00:05:20.480 --> 00:05:22.256
before investing

00:05:22.280 --> 00:05:25.480
is to make the education system
deliver results.

00:05:27.160 --> 00:05:30.896
Because pouring more money
into broken systems

00:05:30.920 --> 00:05:32.840
may only fund more inefficiencies.

00:05:34.240 --> 00:05:36.056
And what deeply worries me --

00:05:36.080 --> 00:05:39.296
if children go to school and don't learn,

00:05:39.320 --> 00:05:41.056
it devalues education,

00:05:41.080 --> 00:05:43.256
and it devalues spending on education,

00:05:43.280 --> 00:05:45.976
so that governments
and political parties can say,

00:05:46.000 --> 00:05:48.256
"Oh, we are spending
so much money on education,

00:05:48.280 --> 00:05:49.736
but children are not learning.

00:05:49.760 --> 00:05:51.736
They don't have the right skills.

00:05:51.760 --> 00:05:53.440
Maybe we should spend less."

00:05:54.080 --> 00:05:58.696
Now, improving current
education systems to deliver results

00:05:58.720 --> 00:06:00.800
is important, but won't be enough.

00:06:02.000 --> 00:06:05.176
What about countries where
we won't have enough qualified teachers?

00:06:05.200 --> 00:06:06.456
Take Somalia, for example.

00:06:06.480 --> 00:06:09.496
If every student in Somalia
became a teacher --

00:06:09.520 --> 00:06:12.616
every person who finishes
tertiary education became a teacher --

00:06:12.640 --> 00:06:14.069
we won't have enough teachers.

00:06:16.160 --> 00:06:19.216
And what about children in refugee camps,

00:06:19.240 --> 00:06:21.240
or in very remote rural areas?

00:06:22.280 --> 00:06:23.720
Take Filipe, for example.

00:06:24.480 --> 00:06:27.696
Filipe lives in one
of the thousands of communities

00:06:27.720 --> 00:06:29.720
alongside the Amazonas rivers.

00:06:30.400 --> 00:06:33.680
His village of 78 people has 20 families.

00:06:34.680 --> 00:06:36.496
Filipe and a fellow student

00:06:36.520 --> 00:06:39.600
were the only two
attending grade 11 in 2015.

00:06:41.080 --> 00:06:45.096
Now, the Amazonas is a state
in the northwest of Brazil.

00:06:45.120 --> 00:06:47.736
It's four and a half times
the size of Germany,

00:06:47.760 --> 00:06:50.040
and it's fully covered
in jungle and rivers.

00:06:51.120 --> 00:06:53.936
A decade ago, Filipe
and his fellow student

00:06:53.960 --> 00:06:55.760
would have had just two alternatives:

00:06:57.000 --> 00:07:01.176
moving to Manaus, the capital,
or stopping studying altogether,

00:07:01.200 --> 00:07:02.440
which most of them did.

00:07:04.600 --> 00:07:08.016
In 2009, however, Brazil passed a new law

00:07:08.040 --> 00:07:12.576
that made secondary education
a guarantee for every Brazilian

00:07:12.600 --> 00:07:16.320
and an obligation for every state
to implement this by 2016.

00:07:17.600 --> 00:07:20.816
But giving access
to high-quality education,

00:07:20.840 --> 00:07:23.536
you know, in the Amazonas state,
is huge and expensive.

00:07:23.560 --> 00:07:27.016
How are you going to get, you know,
math and science and history teachers

00:07:27.040 --> 00:07:28.376
all over those communities?

00:07:28.400 --> 00:07:30.016
And even if you find them,

00:07:30.040 --> 00:07:32.080
many of them would not want to move there.

00:07:33.440 --> 00:07:35.976
So faced with this impossible task,

00:07:36.000 --> 00:07:38.336
civil servants and state officials

00:07:38.360 --> 00:07:41.360
developed amazing creativity
and entrepreneurship.

00:07:42.120 --> 00:07:44.096
They developed the media center solution.

00:07:44.120 --> 00:07:45.376
It works this way.

00:07:45.400 --> 00:07:50.816
You have specialized,
trained content teachers in Manaus

00:07:50.840 --> 00:07:53.216
delivering classroom via livestream

00:07:53.240 --> 00:07:56.400
to over a thousand classrooms
in those scattered communities.

00:07:57.160 --> 00:08:00.256
Those classrooms have five to 25 students,

00:08:00.280 --> 00:08:03.896
and they're supported
by a more generalist tutoring teacher

00:08:03.920 --> 00:08:05.600
for their learning and development.

00:08:06.480 --> 00:08:08.816
The 60 content teachers in Manaus

00:08:08.840 --> 00:08:14.296
work with over 2,200 tutoring teachers
in those communities

00:08:14.320 --> 00:08:17.240
to customize lesson plans
to the context and time.

00:08:19.440 --> 00:08:21.376
Now, why is this division

00:08:21.400 --> 00:08:25.000
between content teacher
and tutoring teacher important?

00:08:26.600 --> 00:08:29.216
First of all, as I told you,
because in many countries,

00:08:29.240 --> 00:08:31.896
we just don't have
enough qualified teachers.

00:08:31.920 --> 00:08:35.216
But secondly also because
teachers do too many things

00:08:35.240 --> 00:08:37.760
they're either not trained for
or not supposed to do.

00:08:39.040 --> 00:08:40.720
Let's look at Chile, for example.

00:08:41.560 --> 00:08:43.696
In Chile, for every doctor,

00:08:43.720 --> 00:08:45.655
you have four and a half people,

00:08:45.679 --> 00:08:47.760
four and a half staff supporting them,

00:08:48.520 --> 00:08:53.856
and Chile is on the low end
of the spectrum here,

00:08:53.880 --> 00:08:56.616
because in developing countries,
on average, every doctor

00:08:56.640 --> 00:08:58.240
has 10 people supporting them.

00:08:59.720 --> 00:09:01.656
A teacher in Chile, however,

00:09:01.680 --> 00:09:04.416
has less than half a person,

00:09:04.440 --> 00:09:07.040
0.3 persons, supporting them.

00:09:08.360 --> 00:09:12.736
Imagine a hospital ward
with 20, 40, 70 patients

00:09:12.760 --> 00:09:15.816
and you have a doctor
doing it all by themselves:

00:09:15.840 --> 00:09:18.256
no nurses, no medical assistants,

00:09:18.280 --> 00:09:19.480
no one else.

00:09:20.360 --> 00:09:22.696
You will say this is
absurd and impossible,

00:09:22.720 --> 00:09:26.216
but this is what teachers are doing
all over the world every day

00:09:26.240 --> 00:09:28.960
with classrooms of 20, 40, or 70 students.

00:09:30.400 --> 00:09:34.016
So this division between content
and tutoring teachers is amazing

00:09:34.040 --> 00:09:36.976
because it is changing
the paradigm of the teacher,

00:09:37.000 --> 00:09:39.216
so that each does what they can do best

00:09:39.240 --> 00:09:41.456
and so that children
are not just in school

00:09:41.480 --> 00:09:43.080
but in school and learning.

00:09:44.640 --> 00:09:46.576
And some of these content teachers,

00:09:46.600 --> 00:09:48.776
they became celebrity teachers.

00:09:48.800 --> 00:09:50.656
You know, some of them run for office,

00:09:50.680 --> 00:09:53.496
and they helped raise
the status of the profession

00:09:53.520 --> 00:09:55.920
so that more students
wanted to become teachers.

00:09:57.960 --> 00:09:59.976
And what I love about this example

00:10:00.000 --> 00:10:03.376
is beyond changing
the paradigm of the teacher.

00:10:03.400 --> 00:10:06.400
It teaches us how we can harness
technology for learning.

00:10:07.400 --> 00:10:09.776
The live-streaming is bidirectional,

00:10:09.800 --> 00:10:13.320
so students like Filipe and others
can present information back.

00:10:14.360 --> 00:10:17.216
And we know technology
is not always perfect.

00:10:17.240 --> 00:10:18.816
You know, state officials expect

00:10:18.840 --> 00:10:20.936
between five to 15 percent
of the classrooms

00:10:20.960 --> 00:10:23.056
every day to be off live-stream

00:10:23.080 --> 00:10:26.280
because of flood, broken antennas
or internet not working.

00:10:27.160 --> 00:10:31.936
And yet, Filipe is one
of over 300,000 students

00:10:31.960 --> 00:10:34.136
that benefited from
the media center solution

00:10:34.160 --> 00:10:36.600
and got access to postprimary education.

00:10:38.120 --> 00:10:39.976
This is a living example

00:10:40.000 --> 00:10:42.856
how technology is not just an add-on

00:10:42.880 --> 00:10:47.496
but can be central to learning
and can help us bring school to children

00:10:47.520 --> 00:10:49.640
if we cannot bring children to school.

00:10:53.320 --> 00:10:54.776
Now, I hear you.

00:10:54.800 --> 00:10:56.216
You're going to say,

00:10:56.240 --> 00:10:59.456
"How are we going to implement this
all over the world?"

00:10:59.480 --> 00:11:01.016
I've been in government myself

00:11:01.040 --> 00:11:05.280
and have seen how difficult it is
even to implement the best ideas.

00:11:06.240 --> 00:11:09.136
So as a commission,
we started two initiatives

00:11:09.160 --> 00:11:11.400
to make the "Learning
Generation" a reality.

00:11:12.400 --> 00:11:15.000
The first one is called
the Pioneer Country Initiative.

00:11:15.560 --> 00:11:18.096
Over 20 countries from Africa and Asia

00:11:18.120 --> 00:11:21.056
have committed to make
education their priority

00:11:21.080 --> 00:11:24.856
and to transform their education
systems to deliver results.

00:11:24.880 --> 00:11:26.296
We've trained country leaders

00:11:26.320 --> 00:11:29.096
in a methodology
called the delivery approach.

00:11:29.120 --> 00:11:31.016
What this does is basically two things.

00:11:31.040 --> 00:11:34.336
In the planning phase,
we take everyone into a room --

00:11:34.360 --> 00:11:36.776
teachers, teacher unions,
parent associations,

00:11:36.800 --> 00:11:39.336
government officials, NGOs, everyone --

00:11:39.360 --> 00:11:41.741
so that the reform
and the solution we come up with

00:11:41.765 --> 00:11:44.205
are shared by everyone
and supported by everyone.

00:11:45.320 --> 00:11:47.256
And in the second phase,

00:11:47.280 --> 00:11:49.656
it does something special.

00:11:49.680 --> 00:11:52.920
It's kind of a ruthless
focus on follow-up.

00:11:54.440 --> 00:11:57.296
So week by week you check,

00:11:57.320 --> 00:11:59.976
has that been done,
what was supposed to be done,

00:12:00.000 --> 00:12:04.616
and even sometimes sending a person
physically to the district or school

00:12:04.640 --> 00:12:08.600
to check that versus
just hoping that it happened.

00:12:09.960 --> 00:12:12.376
It may sound for many common sense,

00:12:12.400 --> 00:12:13.896
but it's not common practice,

00:12:13.920 --> 00:12:16.080
and that's why actually many reforms fail.

00:12:18.040 --> 00:12:19.960
It has been piloted in Tanzania,

00:12:20.720 --> 00:12:26.296
and there the pass rate
for students in secondary education

00:12:26.320 --> 00:12:30.400
was increased by 50 percent
in just over two years.

00:12:32.960 --> 00:12:36.536
Now, the next initiative
to make the Learning Generation a reality

00:12:36.560 --> 00:12:38.920
is financing. Who's going to pay for this?

00:12:40.040 --> 00:12:41.456
So we believe and argue

00:12:41.480 --> 00:12:45.240
that domestic financing has to be
the backbone of education investment.

00:12:45.680 --> 00:12:48.256
Do you remember when I told you
about Vietnam earlier

00:12:48.280 --> 00:12:50.680
outperforming the United States in PISA?

00:12:51.240 --> 00:12:53.376
That's due to a better education system,

00:12:53.400 --> 00:12:55.976
but also to Vietnam
increasing their investment

00:12:56.000 --> 00:12:59.560
from seven to 20 percent
of their national budget in two decades.

00:13:01.160 --> 00:13:04.240
But what happens if countries
want to borrow money for education?

00:13:04.960 --> 00:13:08.176
If you wanted to borrow money
to build a bridge or a road,

00:13:08.200 --> 00:13:10.376
it's quite easy and straightforward,

00:13:10.400 --> 00:13:11.840
but not for education.

00:13:12.680 --> 00:13:16.696
It's easier to make a shiny picture
of a bridge and show it to everyone

00:13:16.720 --> 00:13:19.296
than one of an educated mind.

00:13:19.320 --> 00:13:21.440
That's kind of a longer term commitment.

00:13:22.555 --> 00:13:23.936
So we came up with a solution

00:13:23.960 --> 00:13:27.136
to help countries escape
the middle income trap,

00:13:27.160 --> 00:13:31.376
countries that are not poor enough
or not poor, thankfully, anymore,

00:13:31.400 --> 00:13:34.896
that cannot profit from grants
or interest-free loans,

00:13:34.920 --> 00:13:36.416
and they're not rich enough

00:13:36.440 --> 00:13:39.040
to be able to have attractive
interests on their loans.

00:13:39.920 --> 00:13:43.856
So we're pooling donor money
in a finance facility for education,

00:13:43.880 --> 00:13:46.256
which will provide
more finance for education.

00:13:46.280 --> 00:13:49.536
We will subsidize,
or even eliminate completely,

00:13:49.560 --> 00:13:51.496
interest payments on the loans

00:13:51.520 --> 00:13:53.816
so that countries that commit to reforms

00:13:53.840 --> 00:13:55.496
can borrow money,

00:13:55.520 --> 00:13:58.976
reform their education system,
and pay this money over time

00:13:59.000 --> 00:14:01.560
while benefiting
from a better-educated population.

00:14:03.000 --> 00:14:07.576
This solution has been recognized
in the last G20 meeting in Germany,

00:14:07.600 --> 00:14:11.600
and so finally today
education is on the international agenda.

00:14:14.160 --> 00:14:16.480
But let me bring this back
to the personal level,

00:14:17.520 --> 00:14:19.520
because this is where the impact lands.

00:14:21.120 --> 00:14:25.296
Without that decision
to invest a young country's budget,

00:14:25.320 --> 00:14:28.936
20 percent of a young country's
budget in education,

00:14:28.960 --> 00:14:32.096
I would have never
been able to go to school,

00:14:32.120 --> 00:14:34.136
let alone in 2014

00:14:34.160 --> 00:14:36.056
becoming a minister in the government

00:14:36.080 --> 00:14:38.240
that successfully ended
the transition phase.

00:14:39.480 --> 00:14:42.176
Tunisia's Nobel Peace Prize in 2015

00:14:42.200 --> 00:14:45.576
as the only democracy
that emerged from the Arab Spring

00:14:45.600 --> 00:14:48.160
is a legacy to that bold
leadership decision.

00:14:50.440 --> 00:14:53.216
Education is the civil rights struggle,

00:14:53.240 --> 00:14:55.800
it's the human rights struggle
of our generation.

00:14:56.640 --> 00:14:58.656
Quality education for all:

00:14:58.680 --> 00:15:01.400
that's the freedom fight
that we've got to win.

00:15:03.160 --> 00:15:04.376
Thank you.

00:15:04.400 --> 00:15:08.040
(Applause)
