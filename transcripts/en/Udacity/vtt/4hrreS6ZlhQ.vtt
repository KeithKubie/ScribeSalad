00:00:00.120 --> 00:00:02.969
We're going to show that
subset sum is np complete.

00:00:02.969 --> 00:00:05.960
But, here is a simple
algorithm that solves it.

00:00:05.960 --> 00:00:09.262
w is a two dimensional array of bulions,
and

00:00:09.262 --> 00:00:15.167
wij indicates whether there's a subset
of the first i elements that sums to j.

00:00:15.167 --> 00:00:16.940
There are only two ways
that this can be true.

00:00:17.960 --> 00:00:23.490
Either there's a way to sum to j
using the elements one through i-1,

00:00:23.490 --> 00:00:27.660
or there's a way to sum to j-ai,

00:00:27.660 --> 00:00:33.670
using elements 1 through i-1, and
then ai brings the total up to j.

00:00:33.670 --> 00:00:36.930
For now, I just want you to
give the highest valid bound

00:00:36.930 --> 00:00:39.890
on the running time of this algorithm
on a random access machine.
