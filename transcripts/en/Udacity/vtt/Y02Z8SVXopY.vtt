00:00:00.060 --> 00:00:02.227
So that question is
pretty straightforward,

00:00:02.227 --> 00:00:04.678
let's see where unit rates
really become helpful.

00:00:04.678 --> 00:00:11.138
So, let's say that Rafael drove his
car for 7 hours and went 448 miles.

00:00:11.138 --> 00:00:19.038
And Anastasia drove 496 miles in
8 hours, now who drove faster?

00:00:19.038 --> 00:00:21.398
Rafael or Anastasia?

00:00:21.398 --> 00:00:24.438
And if you haven't written this down
yet, it may be a good time to do so.

00:00:24.438 --> 00:00:26.170
It will help you solve this problem.
