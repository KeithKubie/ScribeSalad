00:00:09.349 --> 00:00:15.690
Last week, a senior vice president of Google
quietly parachuted from 135,890 feet, breaking

00:00:15.690 --> 00:00:17.460
the sound barrier in the process.

00:00:17.460 --> 00:00:24.610
How is it that a human can fall faster than
sound?

00:00:24.610 --> 00:00:28.689
Hey guys, Amy here for DNews, and to call
the sound barrier a “barrier” is actually

00:00:28.689 --> 00:00:29.920
a bit of a misnomer.

00:00:29.920 --> 00:00:33.980
Anything moving through the air, like an airplane,
has to push air molecules out of its way to

00:00:33.980 --> 00:00:34.980
move.

00:00:34.980 --> 00:00:38.399
This forms a pressure wave in front of and
behind the airplane, and the faster that airplane

00:00:38.399 --> 00:00:41.579
flies the faster those molecules have to move
out of the way.

00:00:41.579 --> 00:00:42.879
The pressure waves start to compress.

00:00:42.879 --> 00:00:46.030
At a certain point, the molecules can’t
get out the way fast enough and.

00:00:46.030 --> 00:00:49.100
They form a “barrier” in front of the
airplane that also compresses the pressure

00:00:49.100 --> 00:00:53.789
wave into a single shock wave that moves at
the speed of sound, commonly called Mach 1.

00:00:53.789 --> 00:00:57.690
When the airplane goes faster than the speed
of sound it pierces through that barrier created

00:00:57.690 --> 00:01:00.710
by the built up shock wave, creating a negative
pressure space around it.

00:01:00.710 --> 00:01:03.960
The sonic boom is the sound associated with
the sudden change of pressure.

00:01:03.960 --> 00:01:07.690
Engineers worked long and hard to get a plane
to fly through the so-called sound barrier

00:01:07.690 --> 00:01:12.420
and go supersonic in level flight in the 1940s;
for years pilots trying to fly faster than

00:01:12.420 --> 00:01:16.409
sound had airplane shake and break apart around
them thanks to those pressure waves.

00:01:16.409 --> 00:01:20.530
It was Chuck Yeager piloting the X-1, which
was designed to look and fly like a bullet,

00:01:20.530 --> 00:01:23.229
who first broke through that invisible wall
in the sky.

00:01:23.229 --> 00:01:27.619
So how can a human make it through the sound
barrier without a perfectly aerodynamic rocket-powered

00:01:27.619 --> 00:01:28.619
airplane?

00:01:28.619 --> 00:01:30.479
There’s more to going supersonic than just
speed.

00:01:30.479 --> 00:01:33.950
Altitude, and specifically the thickness of
the atmosphere at different altitudes, is

00:01:33.950 --> 00:01:34.950
a major factor.

00:01:34.950 --> 00:01:38.579
The higher the altitude the thinner the atmosphere,
which means there are fewer air molecules

00:01:38.579 --> 00:01:41.380
for a plane, or a body, to get out of the
way.

00:01:41.380 --> 00:01:45.229
Because extreme parachute jumpers like Felix
Baumgartner and Alan Eustace jumped and free

00:01:45.229 --> 00:01:49.200
fell from such high altitudes, it was easier
for them to move air molecules out of the

00:01:49.200 --> 00:01:51.869
way to hit Mach 1 because the air is less
dense.

00:01:51.869 --> 00:01:56.749
Baumgartner didn’t need rockets to break
through the sound barrier falling from more

00:01:56.749 --> 00:01:57.810
than 127,000 feet.

00:01:57.810 --> 00:02:02.259
Yeager, flying the X-1 at 43,000 feet, on
the other hand, did need a rocket boost.

00:02:02.259 --> 00:02:06.369
But interestingly, Baumgartner’s supersonic
moment required just 10 miles per hour less

00:02:06.369 --> 00:02:07.369
than Yeager’s.

00:02:07.369 --> 00:02:11.340
And, of course, specialized pressure suits
these jumpers wore play a big part.

00:02:11.340 --> 00:02:14.400
Suits designed to protect the wearer from
the shock waves associated with the sound

00:02:14.400 --> 00:02:17.870
barrier, even in less dense air, are vital
to success.

00:02:17.870 --> 00:02:19.330
And not to mention survival.

00:02:19.330 --> 00:02:20.330
So what do you guys think.

00:02:20.330 --> 00:02:21.750
Would you make a supersonic jump?
