00:00:00.250 --> 00:00:04.640
Without Global Positioning Satellites, how
will I know where the nearest off-license

00:00:04.640 --> 00:00:05.640
is?

00:00:05.640 --> 00:00:13.480
Oh, don’t worry, you can just use your A
to Zed!

00:00:13.480 --> 00:00:17.690
Hey there DNews navigators, Amy here flying
you through this episode of DNews, with my

00:00:17.690 --> 00:00:19.500
co-pilot Trace.

00:00:19.500 --> 00:00:21.710
GPS is basically a science-created miracle.

00:00:21.710 --> 00:00:25.840
In brief and without satisfying detail, GPS
relies on network of satellites in orbit above

00:00:25.840 --> 00:00:28.550
the Earth that can determine your exact position
on the globe.

00:00:28.550 --> 00:00:32.860
The thing is, and this is going to blow your
mind, there’s more than one GPS system!

00:00:32.860 --> 00:00:37.829
Russia’s is called GLONASS, and Europe’s
is Galileo, ours is Navstar (weird); and China

00:00:37.829 --> 00:00:42.600
and India’s regional systems (they only
work there) are called Beidou and NAVIC, respectively.

00:00:42.600 --> 00:00:46.570
Europe is building Galileo right now, and
is hoping to finish in 2020, but there’s

00:00:46.570 --> 00:00:47.570
a problem.

00:00:47.570 --> 00:00:50.820
The clocks on board the satellites keep breaking…

00:00:50.820 --> 00:00:54.579
Of the 18 sats currently in orbit, nine clocks
are broken.

00:00:54.579 --> 00:00:55.579
This is serious.

00:00:55.579 --> 00:01:00.210
GPS only works with sat signals, plus mathematics,
and nanosecond-precise timekeeping.

00:01:00.210 --> 00:01:04.949
So the ESA put atomic clocks on the satellites
to keep things perfectly in sync.

00:01:04.949 --> 00:01:08.130
They even have to update them because of the
rules of relativity, but you can watch other

00:01:08.130 --> 00:01:10.340
videos for that…

00:01:10.340 --> 00:01:13.610
The question they’re left with is, can they
fix these satellites?

00:01:13.610 --> 00:01:14.820
Or nah?

00:01:14.820 --> 00:01:16.409
It really depends on the satellite.

00:01:16.409 --> 00:01:18.500
I mean, we’ve repaired satellites before!

00:01:18.500 --> 00:01:19.500
Like Hubble!

00:01:19.500 --> 00:01:23.420
The hubble space telescope was launched in
1990, and filled the cargo bay of the space

00:01:23.420 --> 00:01:24.420
shuttle.

00:01:24.420 --> 00:01:28.400
After being placed in orbit, they opened the
lens cover and saw… well crap.

00:01:28.400 --> 00:01:29.400
Blurry images.

00:01:29.400 --> 00:01:33.409
There was a flaw in the Hubble mirror rendering
it crippled!I It was a huge embarrassment

00:01:33.409 --> 00:01:34.409
for NASA.

00:01:34.409 --> 00:01:38.570
It took five more shuttle missions to repair
the space-based scientific instrument -- fixing

00:01:38.570 --> 00:01:42.450
the mirror, replacing and repairing some mechanical
parts, and two scientific instruments.

00:01:42.450 --> 00:01:44.860
It was repaired again in 2009.

00:01:44.860 --> 00:01:47.100
And of course, it was worth it.

00:01:47.100 --> 00:01:48.100
Completely.

00:01:48.100 --> 00:01:52.439
But would have been impossible had the telescope
not been designed to be repaired!

00:01:52.439 --> 00:01:57.409
We can’t just fly up to any old sat and
tinker, they don’t work that way.

00:01:57.409 --> 00:01:59.189
Sometimes we have to get creative.

00:01:59.189 --> 00:02:00.720
Like with the Kepler satellite.

00:02:00.720 --> 00:02:02.130
Kepler was launched in 2009.

00:02:02.130 --> 00:02:06.530
It’s designed to spot planets in other solar
systems… which requires tracking stars for

00:02:06.530 --> 00:02:10.360
long periods of time to try and spot planets
passing in front of them.

00:02:10.360 --> 00:02:14.880
To move a satellite in space for tracking,
thrusters are out, you can’t exactly get

00:02:14.880 --> 00:02:19.130
out and push… instead, they use what are
called reaction wheels.

00:02:19.130 --> 00:02:21.550
Reaction wheels are a kind of orientation
system.

00:02:21.550 --> 00:02:26.360
Basically, they spin super fast -- think thousands
of revolutions per minute -- and the sheer

00:02:26.360 --> 00:02:32.269
force of that spinning motion transfers energy
to the spacecraft to slightly adjust its orientation.

00:02:32.269 --> 00:02:35.100
Spacecraft typically have four wheels each
offset from one another.

00:02:35.100 --> 00:02:37.480
Three are the primary wheels and one’s a
backup.

00:02:37.480 --> 00:02:39.959
But at the end of the day, it’s hardware.

00:02:39.959 --> 00:02:44.900
Unfortunately, after years of successful planet-hunting,
the reaction wheels on Kepler broke -- meaning

00:02:44.900 --> 00:02:48.260
it couldn’t spin and point at stars.

00:02:48.260 --> 00:02:53.410
They now use pressure from the solar wind
to hold the satellite in place, plus the remaining

00:02:53.410 --> 00:02:55.100
two reaction wheels to keep Kepler stable!

00:02:55.100 --> 00:02:57.090
Now it’s on to a new mission called K2!

00:02:57.090 --> 00:02:59.040
Planet hunting, Ho!

00:02:59.040 --> 00:03:03.599
Aside from hardware issues, satellites are
running computer programs too, and sometimes

00:03:03.599 --> 00:03:05.530
even those can cause problems!

00:03:05.530 --> 00:03:10.000
On July 4 of 2015, NASA lost contact with
the New Horizons spacecraft.

00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:13.090
They got a message at Mission Control saying
it was in “safe mode.”

00:03:13.090 --> 00:03:16.970
It’s like your laptop, so it’s just a
super basic boot-up… obviously not ideal

00:03:16.970 --> 00:03:18.599
when you’re 10 days away from Pluto.

00:03:18.599 --> 00:03:22.920
But unlike your laptop, the team couldn’t
exactly pop up there and hold down the power

00:03:22.920 --> 00:03:23.920
button to reboot it.

00:03:23.920 --> 00:03:30.010
It was 3 billion miles from Earth, meaning
signals took four hours to go just one way!

00:03:30.010 --> 00:03:33.770
After a lot of frantic troubleshooting, mission
scientists were able to reset the primary

00:03:33.770 --> 00:03:37.800
computer with a set of commands, and after
waiting hours to get confirmation from the

00:03:37.800 --> 00:03:40.740
spacecraft -- they were thrilled to see it
was up and running.

00:03:40.740 --> 00:03:42.580
Pluto encounter saved!

00:03:42.580 --> 00:03:45.129
So back to Europe’s broken GPS.

00:03:45.129 --> 00:03:50.050
It’s not a software issue, it’s a hardware
issue… short circuits -- or so they think.

00:03:50.050 --> 00:03:52.159
Regardless, the clocks have failed.

00:03:52.159 --> 00:03:55.340
Even though we flew up to fix Hubble, we can’t
do that here.

00:03:55.340 --> 00:03:59.439
Hubble orbits really close to the Earth, while
GPS is really far away.

00:03:59.439 --> 00:04:01.760
Impossible to reach even with a space shuttle.

00:04:01.760 --> 00:04:03.900
So we can’t fix these.

00:04:03.900 --> 00:04:10.269
But, luckily, there are four redundant clocks
on each Galileo satellite, just in case.

00:04:10.269 --> 00:04:14.900
So a single failure -- or even many -- won’t
necessarily kill the 14 billion-dollar system,

00:04:14.900 --> 00:04:17.900
but the breaking clocks might cause delays.

00:04:17.900 --> 00:04:21.240
So we stop launching satellites and find the
problem?

00:04:21.240 --> 00:04:25.020
Or do we keep launching them and cross our
fingers there won’t be more failures?

00:04:25.020 --> 00:04:27.150
Administrators are thinking about this.

00:04:27.150 --> 00:04:31.060
If the clocks keep failing, the satellites
might have to be replaced sooner than their

00:04:31.060 --> 00:04:32.650
10 to 20 year lifespan.

00:04:32.650 --> 00:04:36.160
The system isn't even fully operational, it's
set to be so in 2020.

00:04:36.160 --> 00:04:39.750
But, by then who knows what GPS is going to
look like!?

00:04:39.750 --> 00:04:41.950
It could be like an implant in my brain.

00:04:41.950 --> 00:04:43.680
Oh that would be awesome!

00:04:43.680 --> 00:04:46.110
For more on GPS and how it works…

00:04:46.110 --> 00:04:49.470
literally everything you ever would want to
know about atomic clocks, relativity, and

00:04:49.470 --> 00:04:51.640
how you can use your phone to find things.

00:04:51.640 --> 00:04:52.640
Watch this video.

00:04:52.640 --> 00:04:54.900
Have you ever tried to live without GPS?

00:04:54.900 --> 00:04:55.900
Seriously.

00:04:55.900 --> 00:04:56.900
Try it.

00:04:56.900 --> 00:04:57.900
