[GOOGLE LOGO MUSIC]

00:00:04.530 --> 00:00:05.800
AYLIN ALTIOK: Hi, everyone.

00:00:05.800 --> 00:00:07.600
Welcome to our session.

00:00:07.600 --> 00:00:09.840
My name is Aylin, and
I am a product manager

00:00:09.840 --> 00:00:10.758
on Such and Assistant.

00:00:10.758 --> 00:00:13.050
WILL LESZCZUK: I'm Will, and
I'm an engineering manager

00:00:13.050 --> 00:00:14.190
on Search.

00:00:14.190 --> 00:00:16.470
AYLIN ALTIOK: Today
we will talk about how

00:00:16.470 --> 00:00:20.640
to enhance your presence on
Google with structured data.

00:00:20.640 --> 00:00:23.460
This talk is for
content creators

00:00:23.460 --> 00:00:26.310
who want to bring rich
experiences on Search

00:00:26.310 --> 00:00:29.340
and the Assistant.

00:00:29.340 --> 00:00:31.920
If you watched our
announcements yesterday,

00:00:31.920 --> 00:00:35.460
you may already know we
launched two new structured data

00:00:35.460 --> 00:00:39.210
types, how How-tos and FAQs.

00:00:39.210 --> 00:00:42.750
Today we are going to cover
these use cases in depth

00:00:42.750 --> 00:00:45.570
and show you how to get started.

00:00:45.570 --> 00:00:48.120
We will also do
recaps on use cases

00:00:48.120 --> 00:00:52.440
we introduced last year like
News, Recipes, and Podcasts.

00:00:54.970 --> 00:00:57.370
Before we get started,
let's take a look

00:00:57.370 --> 00:00:59.950
at the content ecosystem.

00:00:59.950 --> 00:01:02.560
For over two decades,
Google Search

00:01:02.560 --> 00:01:06.370
has been helping creators
to get discovered and help

00:01:06.370 --> 00:01:10.940
users to find and engage
with the great content.

00:01:10.940 --> 00:01:14.510
This has been very useful given
the amount of content that's

00:01:14.510 --> 00:01:18.570
online, and Google
Assistant, which

00:01:18.570 --> 00:01:21.560
is helping users
get things done,

00:01:21.560 --> 00:01:25.010
has also been helping
users find and engage

00:01:25.010 --> 00:01:27.230
with the great content.

00:01:27.230 --> 00:01:29.780
We are seeing this increasingly.

00:01:29.780 --> 00:01:33.650
Just last year, we have
seen assistance active usage

00:01:33.650 --> 00:01:36.000
grew four times.

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:40.270
It's available on more than
1 billion devices, nearly 30

00:01:40.270 --> 00:01:44.820
languages, across 80 countries.

00:01:44.820 --> 00:01:49.250
And let's take a look how
users engage with content.

00:01:49.250 --> 00:01:52.550
When we look back
20 years ago, users

00:01:52.550 --> 00:01:55.580
was mostly consuming
content on the web,

00:01:55.580 --> 00:01:58.870
and they were mostly
on desktop machines.

00:01:58.870 --> 00:02:02.820
However, the way users
are engaging with content

00:02:02.820 --> 00:02:06.620
has been constantly evolving.

00:02:06.620 --> 00:02:10.070
In today's world, we see
users are consuming content

00:02:10.070 --> 00:02:15.190
on the web, mobile apps, and
conversational Assistant.

00:02:15.190 --> 00:02:19.660
They are using multiple devices
and engaging with content

00:02:19.660 --> 00:02:22.730
more moments than before.

00:02:22.730 --> 00:02:25.610
Let's take a look at
typical user journey,

00:02:25.610 --> 00:02:31.910
and let's see how they engage
with content in a given day.

00:02:31.910 --> 00:02:34.580
In the morning,
users can start a day

00:02:34.580 --> 00:02:37.670
by asking Google
Assistant the latest news

00:02:37.670 --> 00:02:43.370
and start hearing fresh content
from many news publishers.

00:02:43.370 --> 00:02:46.310
During a commute,
users can ask Assistant

00:02:46.310 --> 00:02:49.760
to play the latest episode
of their favorite podcast

00:02:49.760 --> 00:02:54.030
while they keep their
eye on the road.

00:02:54.030 --> 00:02:56.700
And during the day,
users browse and find

00:02:56.700 --> 00:03:01.090
information on many topics
by using Google Search.

00:03:01.090 --> 00:03:04.480
For example, Mother's
Day is coming up soon,

00:03:04.480 --> 00:03:07.840
so users could search the
flower delivery timelines

00:03:07.840 --> 00:03:11.830
from different providers, and
if they are too late to order,

00:03:11.830 --> 00:03:14.380
like I always am,
they could start

00:03:14.380 --> 00:03:17.650
searching for last-minute
gift solutions,

00:03:17.650 --> 00:03:22.330
like how to make
origami flowers at home.

00:03:22.330 --> 00:03:24.690
And in the evening,
users can ask

00:03:24.690 --> 00:03:29.100
Assistant to find recipes
and get step by step guidance

00:03:29.100 --> 00:03:30.800
while they cook
with their family.

00:03:33.600 --> 00:03:37.380
Reaching users on all
these moments and surfaces

00:03:37.380 --> 00:03:41.040
is great opportunity
for content creators,

00:03:41.040 --> 00:03:43.980
but building and maintaining
customer experiences

00:03:43.980 --> 00:03:46.620
on each of these
surfaces and devices

00:03:46.620 --> 00:03:50.280
could bring additional
overhead to you.

00:03:50.280 --> 00:03:52.680
Solving this problem
is our motivation

00:03:52.680 --> 00:03:56.190
for working on
structured data program.

00:03:56.190 --> 00:04:00.690
You focus on creating the best
content using open standards,

00:04:00.690 --> 00:04:04.710
and Google will help you
reach your users across Search

00:04:04.710 --> 00:04:09.090
and the Assistant without having
to build a custom experience

00:04:09.090 --> 00:04:12.850
on multiple platforms.

00:04:12.850 --> 00:04:17.440
Last year we announced
News, Recipes, and Podcasts.

00:04:17.440 --> 00:04:22.390
The idea was by using
structured data on your website,

00:04:22.390 --> 00:04:25.510
your content becomes
eligible for rich results

00:04:25.510 --> 00:04:31.150
in search and voice enabled
experiences on the Assistant.

00:04:31.150 --> 00:04:34.270
Let's take a quick look at
how you can start with these.

00:04:37.040 --> 00:04:40.610
By searching your
podcast content with RSS,

00:04:40.610 --> 00:04:43.850
your users could find
and engage with it

00:04:43.850 --> 00:04:45.770
on Search and the Assistant.

00:04:48.590 --> 00:04:53.630
By using M and implementing news
article markup in your site,

00:04:53.630 --> 00:04:58.040
your content becomes eligible
to get rich results in search

00:04:58.040 --> 00:05:03.340
and get serviced on
Assistant automatically.

00:05:03.340 --> 00:05:05.820
And by just implementing
the recipe schema.org

00:05:05.820 --> 00:05:08.940
markup on your website,
your recipe content

00:05:08.940 --> 00:05:10.630
becomes eligible
to get rich results

00:05:10.630 --> 00:05:15.000
on search and voice-enabled
Assistant experience on devices

00:05:15.000 --> 00:05:17.190
like Google Home Hub.

00:05:17.190 --> 00:05:20.910
You get out-of-the-box machine
learning and speech recognition

00:05:20.910 --> 00:05:26.260
technologies without
doing any custom work.

00:05:26.260 --> 00:05:28.670
We have been seeing
great publisher success

00:05:28.670 --> 00:05:30.950
with structured data program.

00:05:30.950 --> 00:05:34.460
You can see a few calls from
recipe publishers where they

00:05:34.460 --> 00:05:38.630
highlight the ease of engaging
with their users on Assistant

00:05:38.630 --> 00:05:42.080
and getting out-of-the-box
machine learning experience

00:05:42.080 --> 00:05:45.620
without doing any additional
code work other than markup

00:05:45.620 --> 00:05:48.210
their site.

00:05:48.210 --> 00:05:51.240
And that's why we continue
working on our structured data

00:05:51.240 --> 00:05:52.870
program.

00:05:52.870 --> 00:05:56.920
I am happy to let you know that
our recipe schema.org markup

00:05:56.920 --> 00:05:59.170
now supports video object.

00:05:59.170 --> 00:06:03.230
With this, you can mark up your
video content on your site,

00:06:03.230 --> 00:06:04.960
and it will show up
on Google Home Hub

00:06:04.960 --> 00:06:09.980
where your users can engage
with your content further.

00:06:09.980 --> 00:06:13.520
Not only we invest in our
existing structured data types,

00:06:13.520 --> 00:06:15.440
but we are very
excited to announce

00:06:15.440 --> 00:06:18.740
two new types at this I/O.

00:06:18.740 --> 00:06:21.470
These would enhance your
content on Google Search

00:06:21.470 --> 00:06:24.150
and the Assistant.

00:06:24.150 --> 00:06:27.000
So we announced How-to,
and How-tos is step

00:06:27.000 --> 00:06:31.920
by step tutorials on real world
tasks like how to tie a tie

00:06:31.920 --> 00:06:34.710
or how to install a
doctor that walks user

00:06:34.710 --> 00:06:37.230
through guided journeys.

00:06:37.230 --> 00:06:40.560
And FAQs are questions that
your users are commonly

00:06:40.560 --> 00:06:46.730
asking about your
product or a service.

00:06:46.730 --> 00:06:48.720
Let's take How-to as
an example, and let

00:06:48.720 --> 00:06:53.830
us show you how the consumer
experience would look like.

00:06:53.830 --> 00:06:58.170
For our demo today, we
created a sample website

00:06:58.170 --> 00:07:00.870
for making origami flowers.

00:07:00.870 --> 00:07:03.810
We added two tutorials
in our website,

00:07:03.810 --> 00:07:06.450
and other than
this, all we did was

00:07:06.450 --> 00:07:10.230
to use how to markup
in this website.

00:07:10.230 --> 00:07:12.680
Let's see how this
transforms the appearance

00:07:12.680 --> 00:07:14.420
on Search and Assistant.

00:07:14.420 --> 00:07:16.980
Let's take Search as an example.

00:07:16.980 --> 00:07:21.110
By just adding a markup on
our site, appearance on Search

00:07:21.110 --> 00:07:23.990
became richer with
preview of the tutorial

00:07:23.990 --> 00:07:27.815
with steps along with the
rich carousel of the images.

00:07:30.640 --> 00:07:32.830
And on the Assistant,
when users are

00:07:32.830 --> 00:07:36.220
asked for things using
major language like how do I

00:07:36.220 --> 00:07:39.730
make origami, our system
will find and surface

00:07:39.730 --> 00:07:41.620
the right content.

00:07:41.620 --> 00:07:45.130
Let's see how our origami,
two tutorials for origami

00:07:45.130 --> 00:07:46.850
will show up on Assistant.

00:07:46.850 --> 00:07:50.050
Let's switch the live demo
for smart display device

00:07:50.050 --> 00:07:54.320
and let me show how
this works in real life.

00:07:54.320 --> 00:07:56.820
So I'll go ahead--

00:07:56.820 --> 00:07:59.040
GOOGLE VOICE: The mic's back on.

00:07:59.040 --> 00:08:02.265
AYLIN ALTIOK: Hey Google, how
do I make origami flowers?

00:08:05.360 --> 00:08:07.490
GOOGLE VOICE: Here's some
instructions to explore.

00:08:07.490 --> 00:08:09.410
AYLIN ALTIOK: So you
can see two tutorials

00:08:09.410 --> 00:08:13.160
we edit in our website just
markup now is available

00:08:13.160 --> 00:08:15.120
and surfaced on Assistant.

00:08:15.120 --> 00:08:19.010
I'll go ahead and pick the
one, and you are seeing now

00:08:19.010 --> 00:08:21.140
with the markup, our
site's description

00:08:21.140 --> 00:08:26.750
is displayed in Assistant along
with the supplies and the steps

00:08:26.750 --> 00:08:27.270
count.

00:08:27.270 --> 00:08:30.295
So we can go ahead and
start the tutorial.

00:08:30.295 --> 00:08:31.670
GOOGLE VOICE:
There are 13 steps.

00:08:31.670 --> 00:08:33.720
I'll read them one by one.

00:08:33.720 --> 00:08:34.220
With--

00:08:34.220 --> 00:08:36.387
AYLIN ALTIOK: With this
assistant will automatically

00:08:36.387 --> 00:08:38.610
start talking about each step.

00:08:38.610 --> 00:08:42.530
So users can go ahead and engage
with the adjustment voice.

00:08:42.530 --> 00:08:46.447
Hey Google, next step.

00:08:46.447 --> 00:08:47.530
GOOGLE VOICE: Second step.

00:08:47.530 --> 00:08:50.050
Orient the triangle with
the long side along the--

00:08:50.050 --> 00:08:52.220
AYLIN ALTIOK: And you see
how all the each steps

00:08:52.220 --> 00:08:53.920
we marked up is showing up.

00:08:53.920 --> 00:08:57.320
Users can also engage with it
by just tapping the screen.

00:08:57.320 --> 00:08:59.620
And as you see for
each step, our images

00:08:59.620 --> 00:09:03.240
are showing up along
with the supplies.

00:09:03.240 --> 00:09:04.980
And also users
can engage with it

00:09:04.980 --> 00:09:07.620
without you doing any
custom speech recognition

00:09:07.620 --> 00:09:09.980
like OK, Google, last step.

00:09:12.330 --> 00:09:14.330
GOOGLE VOICE: Grab a pot
and some crinkle paper,

00:09:14.330 --> 00:09:16.190
and plant your succulent.

00:09:16.190 --> 00:09:18.500
AYLIN ALTIOK: So you get
the idea how your content is

00:09:18.500 --> 00:09:21.200
showing up in rich
experiences on Assistant,

00:09:21.200 --> 00:09:23.740
out-of-the-box voice
and speech recognition.

00:09:23.740 --> 00:09:26.390
And users can go
back and engage more.

00:09:26.390 --> 00:09:30.410
And this will show up also
to remember in the feature,

00:09:30.410 --> 00:09:32.960
they can continue
from the tutorials.

00:09:32.960 --> 00:09:34.100
Let's switch back to--

00:09:34.100 --> 00:09:35.720
GOOGLE VOICE: Mic off.

00:09:35.720 --> 00:09:38.560
AYLIN ALTIOK: --slides, please.

00:09:38.560 --> 00:09:42.160
By just adding a bit
of markup, your content

00:09:42.160 --> 00:09:45.760
becomes eligible for
rich results in search,

00:09:45.760 --> 00:09:48.040
speech cognition
and major language

00:09:48.040 --> 00:09:52.390
understanding on the
Assistant, and discovery on all

00:09:52.390 --> 00:09:55.650
these devices and surfaces.

00:09:55.650 --> 00:09:59.400
Now Will is going to show us
how to get started with markup

00:09:59.400 --> 00:10:01.170
and how easy it is to implement.

00:10:04.485 --> 00:10:05.860
WILL LESZCZUK:
OK, so we're going

00:10:05.860 --> 00:10:08.230
to take a look at how Aylin
built that demo we just saw,

00:10:08.230 --> 00:10:10.480
and we'll walk through the
entire end-to-end developer

00:10:10.480 --> 00:10:11.830
journey here.

00:10:11.830 --> 00:10:15.070
What you got on Search plus
that whole experience, the voice

00:10:15.070 --> 00:10:18.250
guidance as well
as the navigation,

00:10:18.250 --> 00:10:21.080
all that stuff is powered
by the same markup.

00:10:21.080 --> 00:10:22.580
And before we jump
into that, I just

00:10:22.580 --> 00:10:24.466
wanted to touch
again on schema.org.

00:10:24.466 --> 00:10:26.317
Aylin showed us a
couple examples earlier

00:10:26.317 --> 00:10:28.400
in the presentation of
different types of objects.

00:10:28.400 --> 00:10:31.520
And schema.org, if
you're not familiar,

00:10:31.520 --> 00:10:33.430
is just an open
standard that defines

00:10:33.430 --> 00:10:36.560
a vocabulary you can use to add
structured data to your site

00:10:36.560 --> 00:10:37.475
to add semantics.

00:10:37.475 --> 00:10:39.600
There's a couple of different
ways you can do this.

00:10:39.600 --> 00:10:41.900
You can use JSON-LD or
you can use Microdata.

00:10:41.900 --> 00:10:42.850
I like JSON-LD.

00:10:42.850 --> 00:10:44.433
It's a little bit
easier to work with.

00:10:44.433 --> 00:10:45.875
So that's what I'll use today.

00:10:45.875 --> 00:10:47.750
And a couple of things
just to call out here,

00:10:47.750 --> 00:10:49.250
those top two highlighted lines.

00:10:49.250 --> 00:10:51.042
The first one tells us
we're using JSON-LD,

00:10:51.042 --> 00:10:52.625
and the second one
tells us that we're

00:10:52.625 --> 00:10:54.560
using that schema.org
vocabulary, which

00:10:54.560 --> 00:10:56.120
Google understands.

00:10:56.120 --> 00:10:58.698
A couple other things
to call out here,

00:10:58.698 --> 00:11:00.740
structured data is not
just for the text content,

00:11:00.740 --> 00:11:02.282
but also if you have
great multimedia

00:11:02.282 --> 00:11:03.720
assets like images and videos.

00:11:03.720 --> 00:11:05.870
You can also specify those
in the structured data.

00:11:05.870 --> 00:11:08.000
And we'll be able to do
some really cool things

00:11:08.000 --> 00:11:09.260
as you'll see in a moment.

00:11:09.260 --> 00:11:11.990
So please go ahead
mark this up as well.

00:11:11.990 --> 00:11:13.805
With that, let's switch
over to the laptop,

00:11:13.805 --> 00:11:14.680
please, for the demo.

00:11:20.230 --> 00:11:20.730
OK.

00:11:20.730 --> 00:11:23.400
And this is the demo
site that Aylin mentioned

00:11:23.400 --> 00:11:24.420
a couple of moments ago.

00:11:24.420 --> 00:11:27.360
That How-to demo was built by
adding markup to this page,

00:11:27.360 --> 00:11:29.713
how to make an
origami succulent.

00:11:29.713 --> 00:11:31.380
Scrolling around just
a little bit here,

00:11:31.380 --> 00:11:33.090
we have all the
tools and materials

00:11:33.090 --> 00:11:36.210
you'll need to make this as
well as the individual steps

00:11:36.210 --> 00:11:37.950
and some really nice
instructional images

00:11:37.950 --> 00:11:40.978
to go along with that content.

00:11:40.978 --> 00:11:42.520
So we're going to
add markup to this,

00:11:42.520 --> 00:11:45.458
and I'll show you how to use
the search tools to validate

00:11:45.458 --> 00:11:48.000
your implementation and get a
nice preview of what this might

00:11:48.000 --> 00:11:49.208
look like on the search page.

00:11:52.000 --> 00:11:54.880
The way that I kind of like
to do this is to use this tool

00:11:54.880 --> 00:11:56.560
called the rich results tester.

00:11:56.560 --> 00:11:58.010
There's a couple different
things you could do.

00:11:58.010 --> 00:12:00.070
You could develop locally
and then stage your URL

00:12:00.070 --> 00:12:01.570
so that the tool can see them.

00:12:01.570 --> 00:12:03.580
Or you can just edit
code live in the tester.

00:12:03.580 --> 00:12:05.110
I think that's a little
easier, especially

00:12:05.110 --> 00:12:06.485
if you're using
JSON-LD, so we're

00:12:06.485 --> 00:12:08.025
going to do some
live coding here.

00:12:08.025 --> 00:12:10.150
And then you would just go
ahead and copy that back

00:12:10.150 --> 00:12:11.295
to your website.

00:12:11.295 --> 00:12:12.670
It also will give
you, as I said,

00:12:12.670 --> 00:12:14.650
a kind of a rich preview
of what you'll get

00:12:14.650 --> 00:12:16.150
on Search, which is really neat.

00:12:16.150 --> 00:12:17.980
If you're familiar with the
structured data testing tool,

00:12:17.980 --> 00:12:20.480
by the way, this is effectively
the successor to that.

00:12:20.480 --> 00:12:22.938
So you can go ahead and start
using the rich results tester

00:12:22.938 --> 00:12:23.520
tool.

00:12:23.520 --> 00:12:27.747
OK, so we'll open this up and
switch over to the Code tab.

00:12:27.747 --> 00:12:29.580
And what I would do is
go ahead and just put

00:12:29.580 --> 00:12:32.520
in a skeleton of my document to
make it easy to work with here.

00:12:32.520 --> 00:12:34.320
I've done that and another tab.

00:12:34.320 --> 00:12:38.255
So I just put, again, a
skeleton kind of HTML document,

00:12:38.255 --> 00:12:39.630
and then, again,
those hallmarks.

00:12:39.630 --> 00:12:42.240
We have the LD JSON script tag--

00:12:42.240 --> 00:12:44.400
this will be in the head
or the body of your page.

00:12:44.400 --> 00:12:47.190
And we're using the
schema.org vocabulary.

00:12:47.190 --> 00:12:50.130
Now we're going to use the
new How-to objects, which

00:12:50.130 --> 00:12:51.510
we announced today.

00:12:51.510 --> 00:12:53.310
And just give our
How-to a name, how

00:12:53.310 --> 00:12:55.140
to make an origami succulent.

00:12:55.140 --> 00:12:56.770
We'll hit Test Code,
and with any luck,

00:12:56.770 --> 00:12:59.340
we should have a
valid How-to object.

00:13:02.380 --> 00:13:04.750
And we don't, right?

00:13:04.750 --> 00:13:06.130
We have an error.

00:13:06.130 --> 00:13:08.892
But that's OK, because the rich
results testing tool detected

00:13:08.892 --> 00:13:10.600
that our How-to is on
the page, but we're

00:13:10.600 --> 00:13:11.950
missing a required field.

00:13:11.950 --> 00:13:14.890
You can't have a step-by-step
How-to without having steps,

00:13:14.890 --> 00:13:16.580
obviously.

00:13:16.580 --> 00:13:18.730
So this is what that's
telling us here.

00:13:18.730 --> 00:13:20.480
And then we're going
to go ahead and we're

00:13:20.480 --> 00:13:23.530
going to add in those steps,
and then we'll have a How-to.

00:13:23.530 --> 00:13:26.545
Again, I've kind of just
kind of put that code

00:13:26.545 --> 00:13:28.670
sample into another tab,
and I have the steps here.

00:13:28.670 --> 00:13:31.450
This is going to be a collection
of How-to step objects.

00:13:31.450 --> 00:13:33.893
And this is all
documented on schema.org.

00:13:33.893 --> 00:13:35.560
I'll take these, and
I'll bring these up

00:13:35.560 --> 00:13:38.910
into our entire document here.

00:13:42.910 --> 00:13:43.690
Hit Run Test.

00:13:46.340 --> 00:13:48.480
Give it a minute.

00:13:48.480 --> 00:13:51.050
And now we have a valid How-to.

00:13:51.050 --> 00:13:53.040
OK, so this is the
really cool part.

00:13:53.040 --> 00:13:56.477
I'll show you this new
tool, the search preview.

00:13:56.477 --> 00:13:58.560
You can hit this, and we
could see what this might

00:13:58.560 --> 00:14:00.010
look like on Google Search.

00:14:00.010 --> 00:14:02.177
And there are a couple of
things you might get here.

00:14:02.177 --> 00:14:04.740
This is kind of the visual
image forward treatment

00:14:04.740 --> 00:14:06.490
where you could see
the names of the steps

00:14:06.490 --> 00:14:08.282
that we added a moment
ago below the tiles.

00:14:08.282 --> 00:14:10.448
It doesn't look like much
yet because we haven't yet

00:14:10.448 --> 00:14:11.770
added the images, of course.

00:14:11.770 --> 00:14:14.290
But we also have something for
text forward How-to content,

00:14:14.290 --> 00:14:16.373
if you don't have those
great instructional images

00:14:16.373 --> 00:14:17.498
but you still have How-tos.

00:14:17.498 --> 00:14:19.623
We have another treatment,
which we might show you,

00:14:19.623 --> 00:14:21.210
which is this
accordion interface.

00:14:21.210 --> 00:14:23.050
And this also does
some pretty neat stuff.

00:14:23.050 --> 00:14:24.310
It'll show you some metadata.

00:14:24.310 --> 00:14:26.190
And as we go back
later and add that in,

00:14:26.190 --> 00:14:29.080
you'll see how this livens up.

00:14:29.080 --> 00:14:29.580
OK?

00:14:29.580 --> 00:14:33.500
So, we'll go back, and this
time what I'd like to do

00:14:33.500 --> 00:14:36.270
is add in the images.

00:14:36.270 --> 00:14:38.330
So again, I don't have
those URLs memorized,

00:14:38.330 --> 00:14:40.930
but I have them in
another tab over here.

00:14:40.930 --> 00:14:46.180
We'll go ahead and we'll
put this instructional image

00:14:46.180 --> 00:14:50.740
from the site, so it's going
to be the URL for this image.

00:14:50.740 --> 00:14:51.830
We'll put that in step 1.

00:14:54.880 --> 00:15:00.115
And we'll add the other image
for the next step to step 2.

00:15:00.115 --> 00:15:01.105
Run our test.

00:15:05.065 --> 00:15:07.180
View the search
result. And now you

00:15:07.180 --> 00:15:09.580
can see how these How-tos
really come to life if you do

00:15:09.580 --> 00:15:11.080
have that great image content.

00:15:11.080 --> 00:15:12.533
So please go ahead,
mark them up.

00:15:12.533 --> 00:15:14.200
We think this looks
really, really great

00:15:14.200 --> 00:15:18.040
and really helps you enhance
your presence on Search.

00:15:18.040 --> 00:15:19.973
If we go back one more
time and take a look

00:15:19.973 --> 00:15:22.390
at the message we're getting
from the rich results testing

00:15:22.390 --> 00:15:25.190
tool, you can see that we
have a few warnings here.

00:15:25.190 --> 00:15:27.190
And so there is a lot of
other stuff you can add

00:15:27.190 --> 00:15:28.630
to your How-tos--

00:15:28.630 --> 00:15:30.640
A lot of metadata
time to completion,

00:15:30.640 --> 00:15:33.490
description, and, again,
those tools and materials

00:15:33.490 --> 00:15:35.340
we saw on the demo page.

00:15:35.340 --> 00:15:38.050
And when you go ahead
and you add all those in,

00:15:38.050 --> 00:15:40.910
you'll see these optional
field warnings go away.

00:15:40.910 --> 00:15:43.098
So what I've done is--

00:15:43.098 --> 00:15:44.890
actually what I'm about
to do is if we just

00:15:44.890 --> 00:15:46.890
go back to the rich results
tester one more time

00:15:46.890 --> 00:15:48.850
and we take the
URL for that site,

00:15:48.850 --> 00:15:51.177
we'll just validate the
live implementation.

00:15:56.781 --> 00:15:57.960
Just getting in here.

00:15:57.960 --> 00:15:59.530
OK, great.

00:15:59.530 --> 00:16:02.913
Preview the result, and now
you can see all the steps here

00:16:02.913 --> 00:16:03.580
in the carousel.

00:16:03.580 --> 00:16:06.543
You can see this nice
metadata about the materials

00:16:06.543 --> 00:16:08.710
that you'll need to do the
How-to, which will really

00:16:08.710 --> 00:16:10.460
help your user make a
decision and if this

00:16:10.460 --> 00:16:12.650
is the right content for them.

00:16:12.650 --> 00:16:15.840
And on this experience you can
see that we have the estimated

00:16:15.840 --> 00:16:18.150
amount of time it will take
to complete the How-to,

00:16:18.150 --> 00:16:20.100
and, again, all those
tools and materials.

00:16:20.100 --> 00:16:22.740
And by the way, Google will
pick the right rich result type

00:16:22.740 --> 00:16:24.310
based on your user
and the context.

00:16:24.310 --> 00:16:26.220
So if you have images,
you still might

00:16:26.220 --> 00:16:28.800
get this accordion
interface, in which case

00:16:28.800 --> 00:16:31.940
the images will appear in
line in these sections here.

00:16:31.940 --> 00:16:34.110
So that's pretty much it.

00:16:34.110 --> 00:16:36.628
I think we did that in
about five or six minutes.

00:16:36.628 --> 00:16:39.170
And it's just one investment on
top of your existing content,

00:16:39.170 --> 00:16:41.280
and we think this is
a really great way to,

00:16:41.280 --> 00:16:43.970
again, help your results
stand out on Google Search.

00:16:43.970 --> 00:16:45.470
It goes without
saying that anything

00:16:45.470 --> 00:16:46.610
you do in the rich
results tester,

00:16:46.610 --> 00:16:47.870
if you do it just
like I did it here,

00:16:47.870 --> 00:16:49.970
won't actually affect
your search appearance.

00:16:49.970 --> 00:16:51.553
You have to copy it
back to your site.

00:16:51.553 --> 00:16:52.770
So don't forget to do that.

00:16:52.770 --> 00:16:54.530
And also head into
Search Console.

00:16:54.530 --> 00:16:56.690
And you could submit
your site map or URLs

00:16:56.690 --> 00:16:58.183
for re-indexing to
just give Google

00:16:58.183 --> 00:16:59.600
a hint, hey, there's
some stuff we

00:16:59.600 --> 00:17:00.980
might want to check out there.

00:17:00.980 --> 00:17:02.912
So go ahead and do that.

00:17:02.912 --> 00:17:04.579
Let's switch back to
the slides, please.

00:17:13.680 --> 00:17:15.190
Just a second here.

00:17:15.190 --> 00:17:15.810
Great.

00:17:15.810 --> 00:17:16.310
OK.

00:17:19.640 --> 00:17:22.640
So, to close the loop,
let's talk about metrics.

00:17:22.640 --> 00:17:24.200
Search Console is
a place you can go,

00:17:24.200 --> 00:17:27.413
and it will give you tools
and reports on traffic

00:17:27.413 --> 00:17:29.330
and detecting issues
with your structured data

00:17:29.330 --> 00:17:30.945
implementation on your site.

00:17:30.945 --> 00:17:32.570
This is kind of always
the place to go,

00:17:32.570 --> 00:17:33.830
and it's the place
that you'll continue

00:17:33.830 --> 00:17:35.330
to go to make sure
that you're using

00:17:35.330 --> 00:17:36.878
these new types correctly.

00:17:36.878 --> 00:17:38.420
So, along with the
markup, we're also

00:17:38.420 --> 00:17:40.760
introducing two new
things for How-to and FAQ.

00:17:40.760 --> 00:17:42.590
We have these new
search appearances,

00:17:42.590 --> 00:17:43.850
and these search
appearances will give you

00:17:43.850 --> 00:17:45.080
all those stats that
you know and love

00:17:45.080 --> 00:17:47.570
like impressions and clicks
and your average position

00:17:47.570 --> 00:17:49.850
for search results
that show with one

00:17:49.850 --> 00:17:51.267
of these new rich result types.

00:17:51.267 --> 00:17:53.600
So you can go ahead and you
can start checking those out

00:17:53.600 --> 00:17:55.017
as soon as your
content is indexed

00:17:55.017 --> 00:17:58.147
and you start getting
traffic on Google Search.

00:17:58.147 --> 00:18:00.230
Finally, make sure to
monitor your new enhancement

00:18:00.230 --> 00:18:02.280
reports when you have
the structured data.

00:18:02.280 --> 00:18:04.520
We'll also have one
for FAQ and How-to.

00:18:04.520 --> 00:18:06.022
And this basically shows you--

00:18:06.022 --> 00:18:07.730
gives you a bird's-eye
view of the health

00:18:07.730 --> 00:18:09.380
of your implementation
for your site.

00:18:09.380 --> 00:18:10.880
Each of the green
bars there you see

00:18:10.880 --> 00:18:12.650
is, in this case,
a valid How-to,

00:18:12.650 --> 00:18:14.360
yellow would be
How-tos with warnings,

00:18:14.360 --> 00:18:16.185
and red or broken How-tos.

00:18:16.185 --> 00:18:18.560
So especially as you're adding
more content or more types

00:18:18.560 --> 00:18:19.630
of markup over
time, you're going

00:18:19.630 --> 00:18:21.840
to want to keep an eye on
these enhancements reports.

00:18:21.840 --> 00:18:23.423
And finally, don't
forget to check out

00:18:23.423 --> 00:18:25.880
the unparseable structured
data report, which hopefully

00:18:25.880 --> 00:18:27.080
is pretty self-explanatory.

00:18:27.080 --> 00:18:29.032
But this just went live,
I think, last week.

00:18:29.032 --> 00:18:30.740
So again, it's a good
tool to kind of get

00:18:30.740 --> 00:18:33.910
a grip on your site's
overall health.

00:18:33.910 --> 00:18:35.450
OK, and as Aylin
mentioned, we're

00:18:35.450 --> 00:18:37.670
also pleased to announce
that FAQ is launching today,

00:18:37.670 --> 00:18:39.962
and you get all the same
tools and support that we just

00:18:39.962 --> 00:18:41.660
saw for How-to for FAQ.

00:18:41.660 --> 00:18:43.520
So we won't go through
that whole devex.

00:18:43.520 --> 00:18:44.937
But what we'll do
is a quick demo,

00:18:44.937 --> 00:18:46.978
and you get some really
cool stuff out of the box

00:18:46.978 --> 00:18:48.460
that I'm going to
want to show off.

00:18:48.460 --> 00:18:51.070
So going back to our demo site,
in addition to the How-tos,

00:18:51.070 --> 00:18:52.630
is we also added an FAQ page.

00:18:52.630 --> 00:18:55.252
And I just picked
a couple FAQs here.

00:18:55.252 --> 00:18:57.460
What's the point of origami,
and what's the right age

00:18:57.460 --> 00:18:59.410
to start making origami?

00:18:59.410 --> 00:19:01.577
And this is what you get
on Search in the Assistant.

00:19:01.577 --> 00:19:03.868
It's a little bit hard to
see, but on Search again, you

00:19:03.868 --> 00:19:05.142
get this new rich result type.

00:19:05.142 --> 00:19:06.850
And you get to bring
some of that content

00:19:06.850 --> 00:19:10.210
forward onto Search to help
your users kind of navigate.

00:19:10.210 --> 00:19:13.570
On the right, you get more
of a one shot answer format,

00:19:13.570 --> 00:19:15.405
where it will take
that FAQ content,

00:19:15.405 --> 00:19:17.530
and it will surface the
correct answer for the user

00:19:17.530 --> 00:19:18.937
based on their query.

00:19:18.937 --> 00:19:20.687
And there's more than
meets the eye there,

00:19:20.687 --> 00:19:22.930
so let's switch over to
the pixel device, please,

00:19:22.930 --> 00:19:24.013
and I'd like to do a demo.

00:19:33.070 --> 00:19:33.570
OK.

00:19:33.570 --> 00:19:36.720
So first I'll just
start out by querying--

00:19:36.720 --> 00:19:38.940
asking the Assistant
what's the point of origami

00:19:38.940 --> 00:19:42.760
exactly the way that it's
put on the FAQ page there.

00:19:42.760 --> 00:19:45.130
Hey, Google?

00:19:45.130 --> 00:19:46.950
Hey, Google?

00:19:46.950 --> 00:19:49.657
Ask origami flowers what
is the point of origami?

00:19:52.228 --> 00:19:54.020
GOOGLE VOICE: According
to origami flowers,

00:19:54.020 --> 00:19:55.820
the goal of origami
paper crafting

00:19:55.820 --> 00:19:57.650
is to create an often
intricate design

00:19:57.650 --> 00:20:01.010
from a single sheet of paper
in a series of simple folds.

00:20:01.010 --> 00:20:02.840
WILL LESZCZUK: Great, OK.

00:20:02.840 --> 00:20:04.790
So it knew how to kind of--

00:20:04.790 --> 00:20:07.007
again, no custom
action built for this.

00:20:07.007 --> 00:20:08.840
It just pulls the markup
right off your page

00:20:08.840 --> 00:20:10.450
and serves to use as an answer.

00:20:10.450 --> 00:20:12.283
And we'll try the other
one just to be sure.

00:20:12.283 --> 00:20:15.710
So hey, Google, ask origami
flowers what's the right age

00:20:15.710 --> 00:20:19.597
to start making origami?

00:20:19.597 --> 00:20:21.430
GOOGLE VOICE: These
came back from a search.

00:20:21.430 --> 00:20:24.280
WILL LESZCZUK: Hey, Google,
ask origami flowers,

00:20:24.280 --> 00:20:28.708
what's the right age to
start making origami?

00:20:28.708 --> 00:20:30.500
GOOGLE VOICE: According
to origami flowers,

00:20:30.500 --> 00:20:33.470
many children in Japan begin
making origami as early

00:20:33.470 --> 00:20:34.970
as preschool, but
it is up to you

00:20:34.970 --> 00:20:37.760
to determine when your child
has the hand-eye coordination,

00:20:37.760 --> 00:20:40.395
manual dexterity, and
patience to practice this art.

00:20:40.395 --> 00:20:41.270
WILL LESZCZUK: Great.

00:20:41.270 --> 00:20:43.550
Sometimes this thing has
trouble with my accent--

00:20:43.550 --> 00:20:44.420
New Jersey.

00:20:44.420 --> 00:20:45.680
AUDIENCE: [LAUGHING]

00:20:45.680 --> 00:20:48.590
WILL LESZCZUK: OK, so now this
is kind of the cool part here.

00:20:48.590 --> 00:20:51.557
If I formulate this query in a
way that's more natural to me,

00:20:51.557 --> 00:20:53.390
and doesn't actually
overlap at all with any

00:20:53.390 --> 00:20:54.973
of the text on the
page, it will still

00:20:54.973 --> 00:20:58.020
see how to-- it will still
serve the right answer.

00:20:58.020 --> 00:21:00.770
So if I say, hey, Google,
ask origami flowers

00:21:00.770 --> 00:21:03.370
if my four-year-old is
too young to make origami.

00:21:06.108 --> 00:21:07.900
GOOGLE VOICE: According
to origami flowers,

00:21:07.900 --> 00:21:08.640
many children--

00:21:08.640 --> 00:21:09.932
WILL LESZCZUK: And there it is.

00:21:09.932 --> 00:21:13.300
So let's switch back
to the slides, please.

00:21:13.300 --> 00:21:16.730
And what we saw there was
speech recognition, an NLU,

00:21:16.730 --> 00:21:18.560
and this stuff called
semantic matching,

00:21:18.560 --> 00:21:20.240
which you get right out of
the box from Google Assistant,

00:21:20.240 --> 00:21:22.180
and it's powered by
Google's machine learning.

00:21:22.180 --> 00:21:24.722
And so here what we saw was two
completely different queries,

00:21:24.722 --> 00:21:27.027
one as stated on the page
and one completely different.

00:21:27.027 --> 00:21:29.110
And Google in kind of a
different twist to what we

00:21:29.110 --> 00:21:30.880
saw with How-to not
only understands

00:21:30.880 --> 00:21:32.890
what the user intends,
but also understands

00:21:32.890 --> 00:21:35.690
the meaning of your content and
can deliver the right answer.

00:21:35.690 --> 00:21:36.820
And so this is pretty cool.

00:21:36.820 --> 00:21:39.880
No defining grammars, no
new code, no deployments,

00:21:39.880 --> 00:21:41.500
right out of the box.

00:21:41.500 --> 00:21:43.150
And this is the
implementation for FAQ,

00:21:43.150 --> 00:21:44.567
and it's not really
much of a demo

00:21:44.567 --> 00:21:45.983
because it's not
really very much.

00:21:45.983 --> 00:21:47.680
So we think you
get a whole lot out

00:21:47.680 --> 00:21:51.530
of just a minimal investment on
top of your existing content.

00:21:51.530 --> 00:21:55.240
So to recap this section, we
talked about schema.org, FAQ

00:21:55.240 --> 00:21:55.990
and How-to markup.

00:21:55.990 --> 00:21:57.657
I showed you how to
use the rich results

00:21:57.657 --> 00:21:59.470
tester to validate
your implementation

00:21:59.470 --> 00:22:02.352
and get a preview of what you
might get on a Google search,

00:22:02.352 --> 00:22:04.060
and we used the Search
Console to monitor

00:22:04.060 --> 00:22:05.830
our site's health over time.

00:22:05.830 --> 00:22:06.910
And here are some tips.

00:22:06.910 --> 00:22:08.290
If you're using the
rich results tester,

00:22:08.290 --> 00:22:10.180
and especially if you're
copying around code samples,

00:22:10.180 --> 00:22:12.680
watch out for special characters
in the markup, smart quotes

00:22:12.680 --> 00:22:13.730
and stuff like that.

00:22:13.730 --> 00:22:15.670
It might give you
some weird output,

00:22:15.670 --> 00:22:19.170
and just stick to
the good stuff.

00:22:19.170 --> 00:22:20.920
For How-to markup,
this is really intended

00:22:20.920 --> 00:22:24.400
for step-by-step How-tos, so
a sequence of instructions

00:22:24.400 --> 00:22:26.720
to help a user achieve
a specific task.

00:22:26.720 --> 00:22:29.260
Don't use it for lists
of related information.

00:22:29.260 --> 00:22:32.650
We really want this step-by-step
guidance Aylin demoed.

00:22:32.650 --> 00:22:34.750
And don't include step
prefixes or suffixes,

00:22:34.750 --> 00:22:37.307
either, things like
step 1, for instance,

00:22:37.307 --> 00:22:39.640
Google, based on the surface
and the context of the user

00:22:39.640 --> 00:22:41.800
will understand the
right way to frame up

00:22:41.800 --> 00:22:44.440
the information for the user.

00:22:44.440 --> 00:22:47.330
So a visual interface
versus a voice modality,

00:22:47.330 --> 00:22:49.580
you may want to do different
things with that content.

00:22:49.580 --> 00:22:50.680
So just give us the
content, and we'll

00:22:50.680 --> 00:22:52.840
put it in the right
context for the user.

00:22:52.840 --> 00:22:54.370
And finally, when you're
marking up your images,

00:22:54.370 --> 00:22:55.930
please just mark up
the original images

00:22:55.930 --> 00:22:56.920
that you're using on your site.

00:22:56.920 --> 00:22:58.930
Don't give us thumbnails, don't
give us previews or anything

00:22:58.930 --> 00:22:59.430
like that.

00:22:59.430 --> 00:23:01.097
And again, the reason
for that is Google

00:23:01.097 --> 00:23:03.010
will create the
right size thumbnails

00:23:03.010 --> 00:23:05.260
in the right aspect
ratio for the surface

00:23:05.260 --> 00:23:07.298
that the user is on.

00:23:07.298 --> 00:23:09.340
For FAQ markup, just one
thing I want to call out

00:23:09.340 --> 00:23:12.350
is this is really for answers
provided by your brand.

00:23:12.350 --> 00:23:15.130
So if you have a user form
on your site, for instance,

00:23:15.130 --> 00:23:15.830
that's OK too.

00:23:15.830 --> 00:23:18.100
We have a type of markup
called QA page markup,

00:23:18.100 --> 00:23:19.870
and that launched last year, so
you can go ahead and use that

00:23:19.870 --> 00:23:20.510
instead.

00:23:20.510 --> 00:23:22.992
And that's linked right
from the FAQ documents.

00:23:22.992 --> 00:23:25.200
So now Aylin is going to
talk to us about another way

00:23:25.200 --> 00:23:27.600
to add structured data to
your great How-to YouTube

00:23:27.600 --> 00:23:29.691
content called Templates.

00:23:34.410 --> 00:23:36.120
AYLIN ALTIOK: Will
showed us how easy

00:23:36.120 --> 00:23:38.220
it is to get started
on the Assistant

00:23:38.220 --> 00:23:40.900
by just implementing
a markup in your site.

00:23:40.900 --> 00:23:42.750
And that was really cool.

00:23:42.750 --> 00:23:45.660
But we recognize
not all the content

00:23:45.660 --> 00:23:48.780
creators maintain a website.

00:23:48.780 --> 00:23:51.220
That's why we have an
alternative solution

00:23:51.220 --> 00:23:56.160
to build on actions on
Assistant called Templates.

00:23:56.160 --> 00:23:59.690
Templates is the easiest
way to build for Assistant.

00:23:59.690 --> 00:24:02.790
No programming
knowledge is necessary.

00:24:02.790 --> 00:24:05.040
To create an action,
all you need to do

00:24:05.040 --> 00:24:07.620
is to fill in your
content in Google Sheets

00:24:07.620 --> 00:24:10.520
and upload it in
Actions Console.

00:24:10.520 --> 00:24:14.490
With Templates you can create
engaging conversational actions

00:24:14.490 --> 00:24:18.750
like trivia games,
personality quiz, flash cards,

00:24:18.750 --> 00:24:22.050
and we are very excited to
introduce newly added type

00:24:22.050 --> 00:24:26.490
for How-to video tutorials.

00:24:26.490 --> 00:24:28.635
It's a video-based
templates where

00:24:28.635 --> 00:24:32.770
you can create step-by-step
tutorials on Assistant by using

00:24:32.770 --> 00:24:35.100
your own YouTube videos.

00:24:35.100 --> 00:24:38.790
All you need to do is to anchor
How-to steps from your video

00:24:38.790 --> 00:24:44.050
with time stamp,
title, and description.

00:24:44.050 --> 00:24:47.400
And again, similarly like we
showed in the earlier demo,

00:24:47.400 --> 00:24:50.460
your content becomes
available to show up

00:24:50.460 --> 00:24:53.890
when your users are asking
about natural questions,

00:24:53.890 --> 00:24:56.340
how do I make origami?

00:24:56.340 --> 00:25:00.090
In this example, we specifically
created a YouTube video

00:25:00.090 --> 00:25:03.030
and uploaded in actions console.

00:25:03.030 --> 00:25:05.070
So let me show how
that experience would

00:25:05.070 --> 00:25:06.240
look like on device.

00:25:06.240 --> 00:25:08.370
Can we switch to smart
display demo, please?

00:25:13.260 --> 00:25:15.620
GOOGLE VOICE: The mic's back on.

00:25:15.620 --> 00:25:18.620
AYLIN ALTIOK: Hey, Google, how
do I make an origami bouquet?

00:25:24.617 --> 00:25:26.450
GOOGLE VOICE: Fold the
square piece of paper

00:25:26.450 --> 00:25:29.120
in half horizontally
and vertically.

00:25:29.120 --> 00:25:30.200
Flip the paper over--

00:25:30.200 --> 00:25:30.730
AYLIN ALTIOK: Hey, Google--

00:25:30.730 --> 00:25:32.063
GOOGLE VOICE: --and fold along--

00:25:32.063 --> 00:25:33.800
AYLIN ALTIOK: Pause.

00:25:33.800 --> 00:25:35.930
So you are noticing
similar to our earlier

00:25:35.930 --> 00:25:40.100
demo with the markup, again,
we get all the steps anchored

00:25:40.100 --> 00:25:44.120
in the spreadsheet in
here, and we get the video

00:25:44.120 --> 00:25:46.260
alongside with the steps.

00:25:46.260 --> 00:25:48.020
And this is the
video that we just

00:25:48.020 --> 00:25:50.370
hosted on YouTube that's come.

00:25:50.370 --> 00:25:54.410
And again, we can go have the
same experience by tapping.

00:25:54.410 --> 00:25:56.180
GOOGLE VOICE: Unfold
the right flap.

00:25:56.180 --> 00:25:57.950
Hold the left side
of the kite down--

00:25:57.950 --> 00:25:58.340
AYLIN ALTIOK: Hey, Google.

00:25:58.340 --> 00:25:59.632
GOOGLE VOICE: --open the flap--

00:25:59.632 --> 00:26:01.938
AYLIN ALTIOK: Maximize.

00:26:01.938 --> 00:26:03.480
GOOGLE VOICE: --made
in step 3, so it

00:26:03.480 --> 00:26:05.060
collapses into the kite shape.

00:26:05.060 --> 00:26:05.560
Repeat--

00:26:05.560 --> 00:26:06.270
AYLIN ALTIOK: Hey, Google.

00:26:06.270 --> 00:26:07.270
GOOGLE VOICE: --all of--

00:26:07.270 --> 00:26:10.905
AYLIN ALTIOK: Last step.

00:26:10.905 --> 00:26:12.280
GOOGLE VOICE: Make
as many lilies

00:26:12.280 --> 00:26:14.170
as you'd like to fill a bouquet.

00:26:14.170 --> 00:26:18.200
You have the perfect
Mother's Day gift.

00:26:18.200 --> 00:26:19.950
AYLIN ALTIOK: Basically
with this example,

00:26:19.950 --> 00:26:23.100
again, your users
on Assistant can

00:26:23.100 --> 00:26:25.230
go through this
step-by-step guidance

00:26:25.230 --> 00:26:27.860
without needing to
type, and while they

00:26:27.860 --> 00:26:31.260
are following the tutorials,
they can navigate with voice.

00:26:31.260 --> 00:26:34.600
And we created all this
just with the spreadsheet.

00:26:34.600 --> 00:26:37.260
And now let me go to
my laptop and show you

00:26:37.260 --> 00:26:40.170
how you can get started
with the same experience.

00:26:40.170 --> 00:26:41.730
Can we switch to laptop, please?

00:26:41.730 --> 00:26:43.210
Awesome.

00:26:43.210 --> 00:26:47.420
So I already went ahead and
created a project earlier,

00:26:47.420 --> 00:26:51.400
but How-to video templates are
available for developer preview

00:26:51.400 --> 00:26:52.000
today.

00:26:52.000 --> 00:26:53.080
You need to opt in.

00:26:53.080 --> 00:26:56.140
You can go to our
documentation to see how

00:26:56.140 --> 00:26:58.060
you can opt in and get started.

00:26:58.060 --> 00:27:01.060
And very soon we are
going to make it default.

00:27:01.060 --> 00:27:04.030
So the first thing you do when
you go to Actions on Google

00:27:04.030 --> 00:27:07.150
Console, you create a project,
you pick the templates,

00:27:07.150 --> 00:27:08.630
and you'll see
the How-tos video.

00:27:08.630 --> 00:27:10.780
And once you click that
this is the first screen

00:27:10.780 --> 00:27:12.320
that you will see.

00:27:12.320 --> 00:27:14.900
So all you need to do is
to fill in your content.

00:27:14.900 --> 00:27:17.210
So let's get started
how to do that.

00:27:17.210 --> 00:27:20.620
So the first thing you have
to do is to create the sheet.

00:27:20.620 --> 00:27:25.600
So we have predefined Google
Sheets that you can make a copy

00:27:25.600 --> 00:27:27.920
and start filling immediately.

00:27:27.920 --> 00:27:29.650
So this is going
to take a couple

00:27:29.650 --> 00:27:35.080
seconds to make a copy
for us, and we will see--

00:27:35.080 --> 00:27:36.270
awesome.

00:27:36.270 --> 00:27:38.590
We just start with
the Read me file.

00:27:38.590 --> 00:27:41.100
You can also go through the
documentation to read more,

00:27:41.100 --> 00:27:43.500
but this is just to
familiarize yourself

00:27:43.500 --> 00:27:46.770
which experience you are
getting with the templates.

00:27:46.770 --> 00:27:49.680
You can add as much as
YouTube tutorials as you want,

00:27:49.680 --> 00:27:51.720
and, as you add
the YouTube videos,

00:27:51.720 --> 00:27:55.210
this shows up as a tile
card in your home page.

00:27:55.210 --> 00:27:58.110
And this is how your users
may find your information,

00:27:58.110 --> 00:28:03.120
by explicitly asking for your
action like Talk To or Ask.

00:28:03.120 --> 00:28:06.570
And this is the video screen
where your videos will show up

00:28:06.570 --> 00:28:10.080
with the steps, the description,
and the anchors that you edit.

00:28:10.080 --> 00:28:13.470
So this was similar
to what I demoed just

00:28:13.470 --> 00:28:15.420
on the smart display device.

00:28:15.420 --> 00:28:17.280
And let's go ahead and
see how you can get

00:28:17.280 --> 00:28:19.200
started filling the content.

00:28:19.200 --> 00:28:23.580
This is where you are just
getting your YouTube URL

00:28:23.580 --> 00:28:25.140
and pasting it.

00:28:25.140 --> 00:28:28.260
And you can just go ahead
and name your tutorial

00:28:28.260 --> 00:28:30.210
and give it a summary.

00:28:30.210 --> 00:28:33.610
And once you do that, you
can move to steps section,

00:28:33.610 --> 00:28:35.760
and for each of the
tutorials you edit,

00:28:35.760 --> 00:28:37.980
it will automatically
be populated in here,

00:28:37.980 --> 00:28:41.370
and you can go ahead and
anchor them by the steps.

00:28:41.370 --> 00:28:44.940
You give the title to a step,
time stamp of the video,

00:28:44.940 --> 00:28:47.490
and just the bullet points
for an additional description

00:28:47.490 --> 00:28:49.150
for your users.

00:28:49.150 --> 00:28:56.280
So let me just edit something
minor, and say hello from Ohio.

00:28:56.280 --> 00:29:00.300
This is not the step, but just
to give some thing in here.

00:29:00.300 --> 00:29:01.440
Let's save it.

00:29:01.440 --> 00:29:04.950
So all we need to do is to copy
this, go back to our actions

00:29:04.950 --> 00:29:07.860
on Google Console,
and now next step

00:29:07.860 --> 00:29:09.700
is for me to upload the content.

00:29:09.700 --> 00:29:12.840
So let's go ahead and
paste this and upload.

00:29:12.840 --> 00:29:15.720
While this is uploading, we
are running some validations

00:29:15.720 --> 00:29:17.280
behind the scene.

00:29:17.280 --> 00:29:18.822
This validation
passed, but I just

00:29:18.822 --> 00:29:20.280
want to familiarize
yourself what's

00:29:20.280 --> 00:29:22.540
happening behind the scenes.

00:29:22.540 --> 00:29:26.340
If you noticed in our
sheets, we have some section

00:29:26.340 --> 00:29:28.120
that is required fields.

00:29:28.120 --> 00:29:31.290
So just ensure that you are
filling all the required steps

00:29:31.290 --> 00:29:33.610
to make sure validation
doesn't fail.

00:29:33.610 --> 00:29:35.760
And just to ensure we
create the best user

00:29:35.760 --> 00:29:38.880
experience in the devices,
we have some limitation

00:29:38.880 --> 00:29:39.620
to characters.

00:29:39.620 --> 00:29:41.490
So make sure you handle those.

00:29:41.490 --> 00:29:43.950
But don't worry, even
if you miss something,

00:29:43.950 --> 00:29:46.470
in our client side, we ordered
around some validations

00:29:46.470 --> 00:29:48.590
to warn you.

00:29:48.590 --> 00:29:50.540
Let's go back to
Actions Console,

00:29:50.540 --> 00:29:53.240
and now we are ready
to go to simulator

00:29:53.240 --> 00:29:58.090
and test our sample action.

00:29:58.090 --> 00:30:00.750
So for those of you who
are not very familiar

00:30:00.750 --> 00:30:03.720
with the actions on
Google's simulator,

00:30:03.720 --> 00:30:08.820
you can see the first time the
preview may take a few seconds

00:30:08.820 --> 00:30:12.950
to load our draft in here.

00:30:12.950 --> 00:30:16.170
Let's give it-- some time.

00:30:16.170 --> 00:30:17.300
But you can--

00:30:17.300 --> 00:30:20.750
I just want to familiarize
you with the stuff

00:30:20.750 --> 00:30:23.130
with the simulator
you see in here.

00:30:23.130 --> 00:30:28.060
You can simulate experience by
giving a different language,

00:30:28.060 --> 00:30:28.990
different location.

00:30:28.990 --> 00:30:30.930
So if you are
specifically testing

00:30:30.930 --> 00:30:33.210
for certain users in
certain demographics,

00:30:33.210 --> 00:30:35.950
you can go ahead and mimic
those in the simulator.

00:30:35.950 --> 00:30:38.050
And you see in here
there is a version.

00:30:38.050 --> 00:30:40.860
So if you are iterating keep
publishing different versions,

00:30:40.860 --> 00:30:42.370
you will see all
of your versions.

00:30:42.370 --> 00:30:45.750
So you can test, simulate,
and compare different versions

00:30:45.750 --> 00:30:47.820
and decide which
one looks the best.

00:30:47.820 --> 00:30:50.650
For this project, I
only have the draft one,

00:30:50.650 --> 00:30:54.960
and let's go ahead and start
the simulation with the draft.

00:30:54.960 --> 00:30:57.900
So we see in here that this is
where your users will-- where

00:30:57.900 --> 00:31:01.950
you will just mimic
what your users might

00:31:01.950 --> 00:31:05.120
be saying to your action.

00:31:05.120 --> 00:31:07.340
You see now two of the
instructions we put

00:31:07.340 --> 00:31:09.750
in our spreadsheets showed up.

00:31:09.750 --> 00:31:11.750
We can go ahead
and pick the one.

00:31:14.380 --> 00:31:16.155
This automatically
starts the video.

00:31:16.155 --> 00:31:17.530
This is the video
we just played,

00:31:17.530 --> 00:31:22.150
and you notice that now that
our change in the spreadsheet

00:31:22.150 --> 00:31:24.400
automatically
populated in real time.

00:31:24.400 --> 00:31:25.480
The idea is the same.

00:31:25.480 --> 00:31:29.470
In simulation you can go ahead
and navigate through and just

00:31:29.470 --> 00:31:32.350
try to simulate it how
your users would engage.

00:31:32.350 --> 00:31:33.850
Check out the experience.

00:31:33.850 --> 00:31:37.750
You can also do the same thing
by just adding some voice

00:31:37.750 --> 00:31:38.770
commands.

00:31:38.770 --> 00:31:42.760
You either type or you can
also enable the mic to input

00:31:42.760 --> 00:31:43.670
by voice.

00:31:43.670 --> 00:31:46.010
Let's say next step.

00:31:46.010 --> 00:31:47.820
And this is jumping
to the next step.

00:31:47.820 --> 00:31:51.170
So you get the idea how you
can basically test your actions

00:31:51.170 --> 00:31:53.060
before you publish.

00:31:53.060 --> 00:31:56.730
And once ready, you can go
ahead, add your information.

00:31:56.730 --> 00:31:59.420
And you would be ready
to submit this action.

00:31:59.420 --> 00:32:03.910
Basically, can we go to--

00:32:03.910 --> 00:32:06.340
slides, please?

00:32:06.340 --> 00:32:09.580
Basically it was like that
easy to build an action just

00:32:09.580 --> 00:32:11.810
by filling out the spreadsheet.

00:32:11.810 --> 00:32:13.540
And once ready,
once you publish,

00:32:13.540 --> 00:32:15.940
you will also start
getting the analytics.

00:32:15.940 --> 00:32:19.030
So you can see your traffic,
active usage, and the details

00:32:19.030 --> 00:32:21.820
about your
conversational metrics

00:32:21.820 --> 00:32:26.440
like the number of conversation
and messages happening.

00:32:26.440 --> 00:32:30.310
Just to recap, with templates,
we built a How-to video

00:32:30.310 --> 00:32:33.790
tutorial by going to
Actions on Google Console,

00:32:33.790 --> 00:32:35.800
picking up the How-to
Video Template,

00:32:35.800 --> 00:32:38.980
filling out the spreadsheet
by adding our YouTube videos,

00:32:38.980 --> 00:32:41.570
and we were ready to
simulate real time.

00:32:41.570 --> 00:32:44.620
And, once we feel comfortable
with the action and test it,

00:32:44.620 --> 00:32:47.710
we can go ahead and publish
that and start monitoring

00:32:47.710 --> 00:32:49.120
to see how users are engaging.

00:32:51.750 --> 00:32:54.540
And some tips, just make
sure you are anchoring

00:32:54.540 --> 00:32:56.410
your own YouTube videos.

00:32:56.410 --> 00:32:57.990
Make sure you are
logged into Actions

00:32:57.990 --> 00:33:00.600
on Google Console
with the same account

00:33:00.600 --> 00:33:03.370
that you use for
your YouTube videos.

00:33:03.370 --> 00:33:07.200
And, if you are a brand account,
if you are verified on YouTube,

00:33:07.200 --> 00:33:10.320
make sure you also follow the
similar verification steps

00:33:10.320 --> 00:33:13.280
and Actions on Google Console.

00:33:13.280 --> 00:33:16.250
Similar to markup, watch
out for smart quotes

00:33:16.250 --> 00:33:18.050
and special characters
when you are

00:33:18.050 --> 00:33:21.270
pasting your step descriptions.

00:33:21.270 --> 00:33:23.040
When you test
locally in simulator,

00:33:23.040 --> 00:33:24.870
you can catch these
type of errors

00:33:24.870 --> 00:33:27.960
and fix it, so always make sure
you go to simulator and test

00:33:27.960 --> 00:33:29.640
before you publish.

00:33:29.640 --> 00:33:32.700
And just make sure you fill
in all required fields,

00:33:32.700 --> 00:33:35.190
and make sure you are
following the specifications

00:33:35.190 --> 00:33:38.570
to pass the validations.

00:33:38.570 --> 00:33:41.853
And now Will is going
to help us put together

00:33:41.853 --> 00:33:42.770
for the session recap.

00:33:45.940 --> 00:33:48.193
WILL LESZCZUK: OK,
so, to recap, users

00:33:48.193 --> 00:33:50.110
are engaging with your
content in more moments

00:33:50.110 --> 00:33:53.950
than ever before, but being
present in these moments

00:33:53.950 --> 00:33:56.320
while it represents a great
opportunity for creators

00:33:56.320 --> 00:33:57.820
to connect with
their audiences, can

00:33:57.820 --> 00:33:59.147
be a real pain for developers.

00:33:59.147 --> 00:34:01.480
It's hard to keep up with the
proliferation of platforms

00:34:01.480 --> 00:34:03.460
and devices over time,
and a lot of times

00:34:03.460 --> 00:34:05.895
you have to build a custom
app for each one of those.

00:34:05.895 --> 00:34:07.270
So this is the
problem that we're

00:34:07.270 --> 00:34:09.370
trying to solve with the
structured data program.

00:34:09.370 --> 00:34:11.620
By adding a single edition
to your existing content,

00:34:11.620 --> 00:34:14.392
you can get that content out
to more users more of the time

00:34:14.392 --> 00:34:15.850
and more of those
moments than ever

00:34:15.850 --> 00:34:18.460
before across the
entire Google ecosystem.

00:34:18.460 --> 00:34:20.770
And that's why we're expanding
the program even further

00:34:20.770 --> 00:34:23.110
to add two new use cases
to serve two large user

00:34:23.110 --> 00:34:25.587
needs, FAQs and How-tos.

00:34:25.587 --> 00:34:27.920
Not only that, you get the
bring the very best of Google

00:34:27.920 --> 00:34:29.273
to bear for your users.

00:34:29.273 --> 00:34:31.190
You get the power of
Google's machine learning

00:34:31.190 --> 00:34:33.620
on the Assistant, and you
get these lush visual search

00:34:33.620 --> 00:34:35.630
results on Google Search.

00:34:35.630 --> 00:34:38.000
So we showed you two
developer journeys today,

00:34:38.000 --> 00:34:40.340
one for site owners who
have great existing content,

00:34:40.340 --> 00:34:42.590
and another for creators who
have great How-to content

00:34:42.590 --> 00:34:44.330
on YouTube.

00:34:44.330 --> 00:34:45.650
The markup journey.

00:34:45.650 --> 00:34:48.850
In that, I showed you how
to add How-to and FAQ,

00:34:48.850 --> 00:34:51.100
by the way, a markup to
your existing content.

00:34:51.100 --> 00:34:52.719
We used the rich
results testing tool

00:34:52.719 --> 00:34:54.460
to validate our
implementation and get

00:34:54.460 --> 00:34:56.710
a preview of what that's
going to look like on Search.

00:34:56.710 --> 00:34:58.600
And don't forget to keep an
eye on your Search Console

00:34:58.600 --> 00:35:00.433
over time the check
your enhancement reports

00:35:00.433 --> 00:35:03.700
and the unparseable
structured data report.

00:35:03.700 --> 00:35:06.400
For our YouTube How-to,
we used Google Sheets

00:35:06.400 --> 00:35:08.602
to add structured data to
our video via templates

00:35:08.602 --> 00:35:10.060
in the Actions
Console, and we also

00:35:10.060 --> 00:35:11.685
showed you how to
use the AoG Simulator

00:35:11.685 --> 00:35:14.170
and keep an eye on
those AoG analytics.

00:35:14.170 --> 00:35:17.220
So here it all is
again one place.

00:35:17.220 --> 00:35:18.720
And, when you leave
the session, you

00:35:18.720 --> 00:35:20.860
could start right away,
adding How-to and FAQ markup.

00:35:20.860 --> 00:35:22.780
You'll immediately be eligible
for these rich results

00:35:22.780 --> 00:35:23.770
on Google Search.

00:35:23.770 --> 00:35:26.187
And, coming soon, you'll get
those amazing Assistant demos

00:35:26.187 --> 00:35:29.170
that we showed you moments ago,
the How-to guided experience

00:35:29.170 --> 00:35:31.660
on a smart display and
the conversational UI

00:35:31.660 --> 00:35:34.757
on the mobile
assistant for FAQs.

00:35:34.757 --> 00:35:37.090
And How-to video templates
are now in developer preview.

00:35:37.090 --> 00:35:39.340
So go ahead, go log into
the Actions Console,

00:35:39.340 --> 00:35:42.600
check it out, and check out our
documentation to get started.

00:35:42.600 --> 00:35:43.628
With that, thanks a lot.

00:35:43.628 --> 00:35:45.420
Don't forget to come
check out our sandbox.

00:35:45.420 --> 00:35:47.112
It's H, and the
documentation links

00:35:47.112 --> 00:35:49.320
for everything we showed
you today are on the screen.

00:35:49.320 --> 00:35:50.970
We hope you enjoy
the rest of I/O.

00:35:50.970 --> 00:35:52.170
