things in order to tell a story and we
 

00:00:45.730 --> 00:00:50.240
things in order to tell a story and we
thought that poets could learn from

00:00:50.240 --> 00:00:50.250
 

00:00:50.250 --> 00:00:53.279
fiction writers something about

trying to make something that lasts in
 

00:01:25.450 --> 00:01:27.870
trying to make something that lasts in
language and there's no question that

00:01:27.870 --> 00:01:27.880
language and there's no question that
 

00:01:27.880 --> 00:01:31.050

poetry that fiction writers learn about
the development of metaphor the the use

00:01:41.460 --> 00:01:41.470
the development of metaphor the the use
 

00:01:41.470 --> 00:01:44.240
the development of metaphor the the use
of rhythm the way that language is

00:01:44.240 --> 00:01:44.250
of rhythm the way that language is
 

00:01:44.250 --> 00:01:48.810
of rhythm the way that language is
