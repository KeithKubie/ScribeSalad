that killed you all have you could argue
 

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:43.399
that killed you all have you could argue
that if you do six schools of

00:01:43.399 --> 00:01:43.409
that if you do six schools of
 

00:01:43.409 --> 00:01:44.450
that if you do six schools of
architecture and one of them actually

00:01:44.450 --> 00:01:44.460

with that school all right so somehow
 

00:01:49.530 --> 00:01:51.830
with that school all right so somehow
that school tricked you into becoming a

00:01:51.830 --> 00:01:51.840
that school tricked you into becoming a
 

00:01:51.840 --> 00:01:52.850
that school tricked you into becoming a
regular student and getting a degree

00:01:52.850 --> 00:01:52.860
regular student and getting a degree
 

00:01:52.860 --> 00:01:55.010

that was the Bartlett but before that

00:01:55.010 --> 00:01:55.020
that was the Bartlett but before that
 

00:01:55.020 --> 00:01:58.190
that was the Bartlett but before that
was also already at oma so at oma

00:01:58.190 --> 00:01:58.200
was also already at oma so at oma
 

00:01:58.200 --> 00:02:01.249
was also already at oma so at oma
rotterdam again as a student so some

00:02:01.249 --> 00:02:01.259
rotterdam again as a student so some

kind of illegitimate transfer backwards

00:02:04.069 --> 00:02:04.079
kind of illegitimate transfer backwards
 

00:02:04.079 --> 00:02:07.219
kind of illegitimate transfer backwards
and forwards between school and an

00:02:07.219 --> 00:02:07.229
and forwards between school and an
 

00:02:07.229 --> 00:02:09.050
and forwards between school and an
office at the moment you're actually out

00:02:09.050 --> 00:02:09.060
office at the moment you're actually out
 

00:02:09.060 --> 00:02:10.790
office at the moment you're actually out
of school you get out of the office like

00:02:10.790 --> 00:02:10.800
of school you get out of the office like
 

00:02:10.800 --> 00:02:12.360

really fast and set up your own off

00:02:12.360 --> 00:02:12.370
really fast and set up your own off
 

00:02:12.370 --> 00:02:14.339
really fast and set up your own off
and it goes like this so it's a kind of

00:02:14.339 --> 00:02:14.349
and it goes like this so it's a kind of
 

00:02:14.349 --> 00:02:17.970
and it goes like this so it's a kind of
nomadic story so before that first

00:02:17.970 --> 00:02:17.980
nomadic story so before that first
 

00:02:17.980 --> 00:02:19.890
nomadic story so before that first
standard oma is about another five

00:02:19.890 --> 00:02:19.900
standard oma is about another five
 

00:02:19.900 --> 00:02:22.589
standard oma is about another five
schools which gets us back to Brussels

00:02:22.589 --> 00:02:22.599
schools which gets us back to Brussels
 

00:02:22.599 --> 00:02:24.149
schools which gets us back to Brussels
and before that I think you were born in

00:02:24.149 --> 00:02:24.159
and before that I think you were born in
 

00:02:24.159 --> 00:02:27.660
and before that I think you were born in
Brussels right so sort of super Brussels

00:02:27.660 --> 00:02:27.670
Brussels right so sort of super Brussels
 

00:02:27.670 --> 00:02:30.899
Brussels right so sort of super Brussels
but operating in Copenhagen and I think

00:02:30.899 --> 00:02:30.909
but operating in Copenhagen and I think
 

00:02:30.909 --> 00:02:37.229
but operating in Copenhagen and I think
what's of course grade is is that your

00:02:37.229 --> 00:02:37.239
what's of course grade is is that your
 

00:02:37.239 --> 00:02:39.030
what's of course grade is is that your
office and you yourself have been

00:02:39.030 --> 00:02:39.040
office and you yourself have been
 

00:02:39.040 --> 00:02:42.059
office and you yourself have been
embarrassingly successful and so there

00:02:42.059 --> 00:02:42.069
embarrassingly successful and so there
 

00:02:42.069 --> 00:02:44.940
embarrassingly successful and so there
is this kind of phenomenon of that

00:02:44.940 --> 00:02:44.950
is this kind of phenomenon of that
 

00:02:44.950 --> 00:02:48.000
is this kind of phenomenon of that
moment in time even it becomes somehow

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:48.010
moment in time even it becomes somehow
 

00:02:48.010 --> 00:02:51.030
moment in time even it becomes somehow
almost kind of Scandinavian phenomenon

00:02:51.030 --> 00:02:51.040
almost kind of Scandinavian phenomenon
 

00:02:51.040 --> 00:02:54.660
almost kind of Scandinavian phenomenon
or at least this this part of Europe in

00:02:54.660 --> 00:02:54.670
or at least this this part of Europe in
 

00:02:54.670 --> 00:02:57.869
or at least this this part of Europe in
which a series of architects are asked

00:02:57.869 --> 00:02:57.879
which a series of architects are asked
 

00:02:57.879 --> 00:03:00.509
which a series of architects are asked
and can deliver architecture which has a

00:03:00.509 --> 00:03:00.519
and can deliver architecture which has a
 

00:03:00.519 --> 00:03:06.539
and can deliver architecture which has a
certain very sharp clear edge to it and

00:03:06.539 --> 00:03:06.549
certain very sharp clear edge to it and
 

00:03:06.549 --> 00:03:09.000
certain very sharp clear edge to it and
it's 10 it seems to me what's what's

00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:09.010
it's 10 it seems to me what's what's
 

00:03:09.010 --> 00:03:12.680
it's 10 it seems to me what's what's
kind of common about this work is that

00:03:12.680 --> 00:03:12.690
kind of common about this work is that
 

00:03:12.690 --> 00:03:15.720
kind of common about this work is that
there's never anything the same it's

00:03:15.720 --> 00:03:15.730
there's never anything the same it's
 

00:03:15.730 --> 00:03:17.610
there's never anything the same it's
like really relentlessly every time

00:03:17.610 --> 00:03:17.620
like really relentlessly every time
 

00:03:17.620 --> 00:03:20.490
like really relentlessly every time
different so it's a kind of requires an

00:03:20.490 --> 00:03:20.500
different so it's a kind of requires an
 

00:03:20.500 --> 00:03:22.860
different so it's a kind of requires an
almost military capacity to generate for

00:03:22.860 --> 00:03:22.870
almost military capacity to generate for
 

00:03:22.870 --> 00:03:24.330
almost military capacity to generate for
each different job a completely

00:03:24.330 --> 00:03:24.340
each different job a completely
 

00:03:24.340 --> 00:03:27.659
each different job a completely
different concept but also for that

00:03:27.659 --> 00:03:27.669
different concept but also for that
 

00:03:27.669 --> 00:03:29.839
different concept but also for that
concept to be in a way super sharply

00:03:29.839 --> 00:03:29.849
concept to be in a way super sharply
 

00:03:29.849 --> 00:03:33.360
concept to be in a way super sharply
defined so that in a certain sense the

00:03:33.360 --> 00:03:33.370
defined so that in a certain sense the
 

00:03:33.370 --> 00:03:36.000
defined so that in a certain sense the
project speaks for itself that's the

00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:36.010
project speaks for itself that's the
 

00:03:36.010 --> 00:03:38.610
project speaks for itself that's the
theory of it this goes everywhere from

00:03:38.610 --> 00:03:38.620
theory of it this goes everywhere from
 

00:03:38.620 --> 00:03:41.189
theory of it this goes everywhere from
kind of lamppost two staircases to

00:03:41.189 --> 00:03:41.199
kind of lamppost two staircases to
 

00:03:41.199 --> 00:03:44.819
kind of lamppost two staircases to
cities so if you are used to thinking of

00:03:44.819 --> 00:03:44.829
cities so if you are used to thinking of
 

00:03:44.829 --> 00:03:47.220
cities so if you are used to thinking of
objects like furniture having having to

00:03:47.220 --> 00:03:47.230
objects like furniture having having to
 

00:03:47.230 --> 00:03:49.520
objects like furniture having having to
having a having kind of self branding

00:03:49.520 --> 00:03:49.530
having a having kind of self branding
 

00:03:49.530 --> 00:03:53.400
having a having kind of self branding
capacity in with this generation of

00:03:53.400 --> 00:03:53.410
capacity in with this generation of
 

00:03:53.410 --> 00:03:54.750
capacity in with this generation of
architects that's also true of cities

00:03:54.750 --> 00:03:54.760
architects that's also true of cities
 

00:03:54.760 --> 00:03:56.939
architects that's also true of cities
and everything in between so I think

00:03:56.939 --> 00:03:56.949
and everything in between so I think
 

00:03:56.949 --> 00:03:59.939
and everything in between so I think
it's a sort of a super interesting

00:03:59.939 --> 00:03:59.949
it's a sort of a super interesting
 

00:03:59.949 --> 00:04:02.250
it's a sort of a super interesting
phenomenon which you know of course

00:04:02.250 --> 00:04:02.260
phenomenon which you know of course
 

00:04:02.260 --> 00:04:03.930
phenomenon which you know of course
because of the exhibitions because of

00:04:03.930 --> 00:04:03.940
because of the exhibitions because of
 

00:04:03.940 --> 00:04:06.150
because of the exhibitions because of
the books because of the videos because

00:04:06.150 --> 00:04:06.160
the books because of the videos because
 

00:04:06.160 --> 00:04:08.939
the books because of the videos because
of the blogs and so on so the last thing

00:04:08.939 --> 00:04:08.949
of the blogs and so on so the last thing
 

00:04:08.949 --> 00:04:10.619
of the blogs and so on so the last thing
you need is actually to listen to the

00:04:10.619 --> 00:04:10.629
you need is actually to listen to the
 

00:04:10.629 --> 00:04:12.930
you need is actually to listen to the
acting all right because this work is

00:04:12.930 --> 00:04:12.940
acting all right because this work is
 

00:04:12.940 --> 00:04:14.610
acting all right because this work is
speaking for itself and also speaking

00:04:14.610 --> 00:04:14.620
speaking for itself and also speaking
 

00:04:14.620 --> 00:04:16.409
speaking for itself and also speaking
through multiple medium but we did the

00:04:16.409 --> 00:04:16.419
through multiple medium but we did the
 

00:04:16.419 --> 00:04:18.060
through multiple medium but we did the
old-fashioned thing to invite the

old-fashioned thing to invite the
 

00:04:18.070 --> 00:04:19.500
old-fashioned thing to invite the
architect to come and talk to Julian

00:04:19.500 --> 00:04:19.510
architect to come and talk to Julian
 

00:04:19.510 --> 00:04:24.730
architect to come and talk to Julian

00:08:51.890 --> 00:08:51.900
instead of like showing you know an
 

00:08:51.900 --> 00:08:54.860
instead of like showing you know an
actual series of project or

00:08:54.860 --> 00:08:54.870
actual series of project or
 

00:08:54.870 --> 00:08:59.840
actual series of project or
installations or sort of a dacoit models

00:08:59.840 --> 00:08:59.850
installations or sort of a dacoit models
 

00:08:59.850 --> 00:09:01.750
installations or sort of a dacoit models
of our work we decided to actually make

00:09:01.750 --> 00:09:01.760
of our work we decided to actually make
 

00:09:01.760 --> 00:09:05.570
of our work we decided to actually make
a sort of an exploration of on space

00:09:05.570 --> 00:09:05.580
a sort of an exploration of on space
 

00:09:05.580 --> 00:09:09.170
a sort of an exploration of on space
like trying to let people discover space

00:09:09.170 --> 00:09:09.180
like trying to let people discover space
 

00:09:09.180 --> 00:09:11.300
like trying to let people discover space
and maybe that's the kind of compression

00:09:11.300 --> 00:09:11.310
and maybe that's the kind of compression
 

00:09:11.310 --> 00:09:13.430
and maybe that's the kind of compression
and extension of space so the way we did

00:09:13.430 --> 00:09:13.440
and extension of space so the way we did
 

00:09:13.440 --> 00:09:15.980
and extension of space so the way we did
it is actually to set up a program that

00:09:15.980 --> 00:09:15.990
it is actually to set up a program that
 

00:09:15.990 --> 00:09:18.560
it is actually to set up a program that
allows to receive the entire new york

00:09:18.560 --> 00:09:18.570
allows to receive the entire new york
 

00:09:18.570 --> 00:09:21.790
allows to receive the entire new york
city block through this through this

00:09:21.790 --> 00:09:21.800
city block through this through this
 

00:09:21.800 --> 00:09:24.380
city block through this through this
visual installation which i'm going to

00:09:24.380 --> 00:09:24.390
visual installation which i'm going to
 

00:09:24.390 --> 00:09:31.160
visual installation which i'm going to
show hopefully is going to work so what

00:09:31.160 --> 00:09:31.170
show hopefully is going to work so what
 

00:09:31.170 --> 00:09:39.440
show hopefully is going to work so what
you have is what you should have

00:09:39.440 --> 00:09:39.450
 
 

00:09:39.450 --> 00:09:42.030
 
so I'm just going to explain this is the

00:09:42.030 --> 00:09:42.040
so I'm just going to explain this is the
 

00:09:42.040 --> 00:09:44.240
so I'm just going to explain this is the
space this tiny space is in fact a half

00:09:44.240 --> 00:09:44.250
space this tiny space is in fact a half
 

00:09:44.250 --> 00:09:47.910
space this tiny space is in fact a half
space of the existing gallery so what we

00:09:47.910 --> 00:09:47.920
space of the existing gallery so what we
 

00:09:47.920 --> 00:09:49.620
space of the existing gallery so what we
did we build this wall and then we made

00:09:49.620 --> 00:09:49.630
did we build this wall and then we made
 

00:09:49.630 --> 00:09:51.960
did we build this wall and then we made
a retro projection over onto it and we

00:09:51.960 --> 00:09:51.970
a retro projection over onto it and we
 

00:09:51.970 --> 00:09:53.640
a retro projection over onto it and we
have as you can see up there little

00:09:53.640 --> 00:09:53.650
have as you can see up there little
 

00:09:53.650 --> 00:09:56.430
have as you can see up there little
camera that's a sensor and it senses the

00:09:56.430 --> 00:09:56.440
camera that's a sensor and it senses the
 

00:09:56.440 --> 00:09:58.800
camera that's a sensor and it senses the
location of the guy of the person in the

00:09:58.800 --> 00:09:58.810
location of the guy of the person in the
 

00:09:58.810 --> 00:10:00.630
location of the guy of the person in the
space you can be multiple people in the

00:10:00.630 --> 00:10:00.640
space you can be multiple people in the
 

00:10:00.640 --> 00:10:03.120
space you can be multiple people in the
space and the point of it is that as the

00:10:03.120 --> 00:10:03.130
space and the point of it is that as the
 

00:10:03.130 --> 00:10:05.250
space and the point of it is that as the
person works towards the screen it will

00:10:05.250 --> 00:10:05.260
person works towards the screen it will
 

00:10:05.260 --> 00:10:07.680
person works towards the screen it will
actually walks towards the entire new

00:10:07.680 --> 00:10:07.690
actually walks towards the entire new
 

00:10:07.690 --> 00:10:09.269
actually walks towards the entire new
york city block all the way to the

00:10:09.269 --> 00:10:09.279
york city block all the way to the
 

00:10:09.279 --> 00:10:12.900
york city block all the way to the
street behind and so it looks a little

00:10:12.900 --> 00:10:12.910
street behind and so it looks a little
 

00:10:12.910 --> 00:10:17.250
street behind and so it looks a little
bit like this the first space that you

00:10:17.250 --> 00:10:17.260
bit like this the first space that you
 

00:10:17.260 --> 00:10:20.579
bit like this the first space that you
will encounter is actually the storage

00:10:20.579 --> 00:10:20.589
will encounter is actually the storage
 

00:10:20.589 --> 00:10:24.300
will encounter is actually the storage
space of a outer space so it's a rather

00:10:24.300 --> 00:10:24.310
space of a outer space so it's a rather
 

00:10:24.310 --> 00:10:26.940
space of a outer space so it's a rather
messy space we had to kind of record no

00:10:26.940 --> 00:10:26.950
messy space we had to kind of record no
 

00:10:26.950 --> 00:10:29.790
messy space we had to kind of record no
visually the whole series of spaces

00:10:29.790 --> 00:10:29.800
visually the whole series of spaces
 

00:10:29.800 --> 00:10:32.910
visually the whole series of spaces
behind as he goes through this we will

00:10:32.910 --> 00:10:32.920
behind as he goes through this we will
 

00:10:32.920 --> 00:10:37.380
behind as he goes through this we will
have sort of a studio another studio

00:10:37.380 --> 00:10:37.390
have sort of a studio another studio
 

00:10:37.390 --> 00:10:43.110
have sort of a studio another studio
that goes then into an apartment of the

00:10:43.110 --> 00:10:43.120
that goes then into an apartment of the
 

00:10:43.120 --> 00:10:50.970
that goes then into an apartment of the
artist and beyond that there's a sort of

00:10:50.970 --> 00:10:50.980
artist and beyond that there's a sort of
 

00:10:50.980 --> 00:10:53.070
artist and beyond that there's a sort of
rooftop and then you can see the other

00:10:53.070 --> 00:10:53.080
rooftop and then you can see the other
 

00:10:53.080 --> 00:10:55.560
rooftop and then you can see the other
side of the street so this is what like

00:10:55.560 --> 00:10:55.570
side of the street so this is what like
 

00:10:55.570 --> 00:10:59.360
side of the street so this is what like
one sort of compressed series of spaces

00:10:59.360 --> 00:10:59.370
one sort of compressed series of spaces
 

00:10:59.370 --> 00:11:02.610
one sort of compressed series of spaces
put together into you know a sort of

00:11:02.610 --> 00:11:02.620
put together into you know a sort of
 

00:11:02.620 --> 00:11:06.600
put together into you know a sort of
experience that makes you go beyond the

00:11:06.600 --> 00:11:06.610
experience that makes you go beyond the
 

00:11:06.610 --> 00:11:10.530
experience that makes you go beyond the
space that you within and this came up

00:11:10.530 --> 00:11:10.540
space that you within and this came up
 

00:11:10.540 --> 00:11:13.110
space that you within and this came up
as a kind of idea to actually explore

00:11:13.110 --> 00:11:13.120
as a kind of idea to actually explore
 

00:11:13.120 --> 00:11:14.579
as a kind of idea to actually explore
you know the condition of space or the

00:11:14.579 --> 00:11:14.589
you know the condition of space or the
 

00:11:14.589 --> 00:11:15.810
you know the condition of space or the
perception of space itself which is

00:11:15.810 --> 00:11:15.820
perception of space itself which is
 

00:11:15.820 --> 00:11:17.360
perception of space itself which is
something that we don't get to do much

00:11:17.360 --> 00:11:17.370
something that we don't get to do much
 

00:11:17.370 --> 00:11:19.920
something that we don't get to do much
in architecture when we deal with you

00:11:19.920 --> 00:11:19.930
in architecture when we deal with you
 

00:11:19.930 --> 00:11:23.430
in architecture when we deal with you
know build projects like we do another

00:11:23.430 --> 00:11:23.440
know build projects like we do another
 

00:11:23.440 --> 00:11:26.180
know build projects like we do another
installation was one that we did for the

00:11:26.180 --> 00:11:26.190
installation was one that we did for the
 

00:11:26.190 --> 00:11:29.190
installation was one that we did for the
contemplating the void exhibition for

00:11:29.190 --> 00:11:29.200
contemplating the void exhibition for
 

00:11:29.200 --> 00:11:33.780
contemplating the void exhibition for
for Guggenheim where we decided to if I

00:11:33.780 --> 00:11:33.790
for Guggenheim where we decided to if I
 

00:11:33.790 --> 00:11:36.420
for Guggenheim where we decided to if I
just showed a space to make an

00:11:36.420 --> 00:11:36.430
just showed a space to make an
 

00:11:36.430 --> 00:11:38.130
just showed a space to make an
installation that would allow for people

00:11:38.130 --> 00:11:38.140
installation that would allow for people
 

00:11:38.140 --> 00:11:40.170
installation that would allow for people
as you know the idea of the sort of

00:11:40.170 --> 00:11:40.180
as you know the idea of the sort of
 

00:11:40.180 --> 00:11:42.900
as you know the idea of the sort of
museum is to go down so from

00:11:42.900 --> 00:11:42.910
museum is to go down so from
 

00:11:42.910 --> 00:11:45.700
museum is to go down so from
top level all the way to the to the

00:11:45.700 --> 00:11:45.710
top level all the way to the to the
 

00:11:45.710 --> 00:11:48.430
top level all the way to the to the
ground floor the ID here would be to go

00:11:48.430 --> 00:11:48.440
ground floor the ID here would be to go
 

00:11:48.440 --> 00:11:50.530
ground floor the ID here would be to go
down but not within the exhibition

00:11:50.530 --> 00:11:50.540
down but not within the exhibition
 

00:11:50.540 --> 00:11:52.060
down but not within the exhibition
spaces but in fact within the void

00:11:52.060 --> 00:11:52.070
spaces but in fact within the void
 

00:11:52.070 --> 00:11:53.440
spaces but in fact within the void
itself and that's what we call it the

00:11:53.440 --> 00:11:53.450
itself and that's what we call it the
 

00:11:53.450 --> 00:11:56.290
itself and that's what we call it the
experiencing the void installation and

00:11:56.290 --> 00:11:56.300
experiencing the void installation and
 

00:11:56.300 --> 00:11:59.100
experiencing the void installation and
is this sort of bouncing net that

00:11:59.100 --> 00:11:59.110
is this sort of bouncing net that
 

00:11:59.110 --> 00:12:01.720
is this sort of bouncing net that
spirals down all the way to the to the

00:12:01.720 --> 00:12:01.730
spirals down all the way to the to the
 

00:12:01.730 --> 00:12:04.180
spirals down all the way to the to the
ground floor and so this this is of

00:12:04.180 --> 00:12:04.190
ground floor and so this this is of
 

00:12:04.190 --> 00:12:07.420
ground floor and so this this is of
course not not done as a project but

00:12:07.420 --> 00:12:07.430
course not not done as a project but
 

00:12:07.430 --> 00:12:12.490
course not not done as a project but
it's a it's an ID which brings me to a

00:12:12.490 --> 00:12:12.500
it's a it's an ID which brings me to a
 

00:12:12.500 --> 00:12:15.220
it's a it's an ID which brings me to a
person that I respect a lot is a scalar

00:12:15.220 --> 00:12:15.230
person that I respect a lot is a scalar
 

00:12:15.230 --> 00:12:17.710
person that I respect a lot is a scalar
I was myself a scalar for years and I

00:12:17.710 --> 00:12:17.720
I was myself a scalar for years and I
 

00:12:17.720 --> 00:12:20.920
I was myself a scalar for years and I
sort of a like in particular these guys

00:12:20.920 --> 00:12:20.930
sort of a like in particular these guys
 

00:12:20.930 --> 00:12:23.290
sort of a like in particular these guys
work I call it work but most people

00:12:23.290 --> 00:12:23.300
work I call it work but most people
 

00:12:23.300 --> 00:12:26.430
work I call it work but most people
would call it a destruction which is a

00:12:26.430 --> 00:12:26.440
would call it a destruction which is a
 

00:12:26.440 --> 00:12:28.780
would call it a destruction which is a
sort of form of Street skating that's

00:12:28.780 --> 00:12:28.790
sort of form of Street skating that's
 

00:12:28.790 --> 00:12:30.280
sort of form of Street skating that's
extremely advanced I'm just going to

00:12:30.280 --> 00:12:30.290
extremely advanced I'm just going to
 

00:12:30.290 --> 00:12:38.740
extremely advanced I'm just going to
show a video of what he does and so

00:12:38.740 --> 00:12:38.750
show a video of what he does and so
 

00:12:38.750 --> 00:12:40.870
show a video of what he does and so
obviously you know skating industry is

00:12:40.870 --> 00:12:40.880
obviously you know skating industry is
 

00:12:40.880 --> 00:12:44.590
obviously you know skating industry is
all about sort of you know destroying or

00:12:44.590 --> 00:12:44.600
all about sort of you know destroying or
 

00:12:44.600 --> 00:12:47.590
all about sort of you know destroying or
abusing the streetscape one thing that's

00:12:47.590 --> 00:12:47.600
abusing the streetscape one thing that's
 

00:12:47.600 --> 00:12:48.910
abusing the streetscape one thing that's
interesting about the way does he is

00:12:48.910 --> 00:12:48.920
interesting about the way does he is
 

00:12:48.920 --> 00:12:51.220
interesting about the way does he is
just like he's also sort of manipulating

00:12:51.220 --> 00:12:51.230
just like he's also sort of manipulating
 

00:12:51.230 --> 00:12:53.140
just like he's also sort of manipulating
the tool itself but he's using which is

00:12:53.140 --> 00:12:53.150
the tool itself but he's using which is
 

00:12:53.150 --> 00:12:56.680
the tool itself but he's using which is
a skate board he invented this way of

00:12:56.680 --> 00:12:56.690
a skate board he invented this way of
 

00:12:56.690 --> 00:12:58.930
a skate board he invented this way of
sliding where he slides on the grip like

00:12:58.930 --> 00:12:58.940
sliding where he slides on the grip like
 

00:12:58.940 --> 00:13:01.440
sliding where he slides on the grip like
this which was you know it's only a

00:13:01.440 --> 00:13:01.450
this which was you know it's only a
 

00:13:01.450 --> 00:13:04.960
this which was you know it's only a
total revolution when you came out at

00:13:04.960 --> 00:13:04.970
total revolution when you came out at
 

00:13:04.970 --> 00:13:07.990
total revolution when you came out at
least four ice skaters and I just

00:13:07.990 --> 00:13:08.000
least four ice skaters and I just
 

00:13:08.000 --> 00:13:10.750
least four ice skaters and I just
feeling like it's type of intervention

00:13:10.750 --> 00:13:10.760
feeling like it's type of intervention
 

00:13:10.760 --> 00:13:13.300
feeling like it's type of intervention
in space is really a sort of thing that

00:13:13.300 --> 00:13:13.310
in space is really a sort of thing that
 

00:13:13.310 --> 00:13:15.400
in space is really a sort of thing that
we would like to contribute to the war

00:13:15.400 --> 00:13:15.410
we would like to contribute to the war
 

00:13:15.410 --> 00:13:21.670
we would like to contribute to the war
work so let's see if we manage these are

00:13:21.670 --> 00:13:21.680
work so let's see if we manage these are
 

00:13:21.680 --> 00:13:22.960
work so let's see if we manage these are
some of the project that I would

00:13:22.960 --> 00:13:22.970
some of the project that I would
 

00:13:22.970 --> 00:13:26.260
some of the project that I would
classify in different ways this is like

00:13:26.260 --> 00:13:26.270
classify in different ways this is like
 

00:13:26.270 --> 00:13:28.030
classify in different ways this is like
two or three projects that I call

00:13:28.030 --> 00:13:28.040
two or three projects that I call
 

00:13:28.040 --> 00:13:31.690
two or three projects that I call

mostly public spaces that we have

00:13:34.090 --> 00:13:34.100
mostly public spaces that we have
 

00:13:34.100 --> 00:13:37.360
mostly public spaces that we have
injected with some programs such as this

to you know young kids and what was

00:13:46.600 --> 00:13:46.610
to you know young kids and what was
 

00:13:46.610 --> 00:13:48.160
to you know young kids and what was
interesting about it is that not only

00:13:48.160 --> 00:13:48.170
interesting about it is that not only
 

00:13:48.170 --> 00:13:51.070
interesting about it is that not only
the project provided you know the spaces

00:13:51.070 --> 00:13:51.080
the project provided you know the spaces
 

00:13:51.080 --> 00:13:51.700
the project provided you know the spaces
and they can

00:13:51.700 --> 00:13:51.710
and they can
 

00:13:51.710 --> 00:13:54.400
and they can
community spaces that were required but

00:13:54.400 --> 00:13:54.410
community spaces that were required but
 

00:13:54.410 --> 00:13:58.210
community spaces that were required but
also it provided this kind of somehow

00:13:58.210 --> 00:13:58.220
also it provided this kind of somehow
 

00:13:58.220 --> 00:14:00.730
also it provided this kind of somehow
like the topography of spaces that were

00:14:00.730 --> 00:14:00.740
like the topography of spaces that were
 

00:14:00.740 --> 00:14:04.120
like the topography of spaces that were
not so required but unleash a kind of

00:14:04.120 --> 00:14:04.130
not so required but unleash a kind of
 

00:14:04.130 --> 00:14:07.150
not so required but unleash a kind of
attitude towards using the facilities

00:14:07.150 --> 00:14:07.160
attitude towards using the facilities
 

00:14:07.160 --> 00:14:09.250
attitude towards using the facilities
this is actually a day where we went to

00:14:09.250 --> 00:14:09.260
this is actually a day where we went to
 

00:14:09.260 --> 00:14:12.760
this is actually a day where we went to
shoot where the kids decided to form to

00:14:12.760 --> 00:14:12.770
shoot where the kids decided to form to
 

00:14:12.770 --> 00:14:15.550

sort of rival teams because there's two

00:14:15.550 --> 00:14:15.560
sort of rival teams because there's two
 

00:14:15.560 --> 00:14:16.930
sort of rival teams because there's two
hills and they were trying to kind of

00:14:16.930 --> 00:14:16.940
hills and they were trying to kind of
 

00:14:16.940 --> 00:14:19.300
hills and they were trying to kind of
you know get the heel of the opponent

00:14:19.300 --> 00:14:19.310
you know get the heel of the opponent
 

00:14:19.310 --> 00:14:21.790
you know get the heel of the opponent
and so they started like so playing with

00:14:21.790 --> 00:14:21.800
and so they started like so playing with
 

00:14:21.800 --> 00:14:25.090
and so they started like so playing with
these virtual wave guns with hockey

00:14:25.090 --> 00:14:25.100
these virtual wave guns with hockey
 

00:14:25.100 --> 00:14:28.990

here for the harbour bath in Copenhagen

00:14:47.350 --> 00:14:47.360
here for the harbour bath in Copenhagen
 

00:14:47.360 --> 00:14:50.260
here for the harbour bath in Copenhagen
was the idea to actually just provide

00:14:50.260 --> 00:14:50.270
was the idea to actually just provide
 

00:14:50.270 --> 00:14:53.710

you know a space for for outdoor bathing
 

00:14:53.720 --> 00:14:56.740
you know a space for for outdoor bathing
and and sort of outdoor public use on

00:14:56.740 --> 00:14:56.750
and and sort of outdoor public use on
 

00:14:56.750 --> 00:15:00.070

this sort of very busy place actually

00:15:07.060 --> 00:15:07.070
this sort of very busy place actually
 

00:15:07.070 --> 00:15:09.220
this sort of very busy place actually
not so busy on this picture but normally

00:15:09.220 --> 00:15:09.230
not so busy on this picture but normally

on some days you have like you know you

00:15:11.380 --> 00:15:11.390
on some days you have like you know you
 

00:15:11.390 --> 00:15:13.180

park and later on we were asked we

00:15:17.770 --> 00:15:17.780
park and later on we were asked we
 

00:15:17.780 --> 00:15:19.360

participated in a competition to do a

00:15:19.360 --> 00:15:19.370
participated in a competition to do a
 

00:15:19.370 --> 00:15:21.700
participated in a competition to do a
huge public space on the other side

00:15:21.700 --> 00:15:21.710
huge public space on the other side
 

00:15:21.710 --> 00:15:23.350
huge public space on the other side
because the other side the side of the

00:15:23.350 --> 00:15:23.360
because the other side the side of the
 

00:15:23.360 --> 00:15:24.760
because the other side the side of the
harbour is completely depraved of

00:15:24.760 --> 00:15:24.770
harbour is completely depraved of
 

00:15:24.770 --> 00:15:26.850
harbour is completely depraved of
activities hardly anything happening

00:15:26.850 --> 00:15:26.860
activities hardly anything happening
 

00:15:26.860 --> 00:15:29.560
activities hardly anything happening
maybe thanks to some of these by really

00:15:29.560 --> 00:15:29.570
maybe thanks to some of these by really
 

00:15:29.570 --> 00:15:33.220
maybe thanks to some of these by really
ugly and big buildings that are not

00:15:33.220 --> 00:15:33.230
ugly and big buildings that are not
 

00:15:33.230 --> 00:15:35.860
ugly and big buildings that are not
doing anything for the public space so

00:15:35.860 --> 00:15:35.870
doing anything for the public space so
 

00:15:35.870 --> 00:15:37.780
doing anything for the public space so
the idea there was to actually create a

00:15:37.780 --> 00:15:37.790
the idea there was to actually create a
 

00:15:37.790 --> 00:15:41.440
the idea there was to actually create a
sort of extension of the piers this is

00:15:41.440 --> 00:15:41.450
sort of extension of the piers this is
 

00:15:41.450 --> 00:15:42.990
sort of extension of the piers this is
the way it looks today which is pretty

00:15:42.990 --> 00:15:43.000
the way it looks today which is pretty
 

00:15:43.000 --> 00:15:47.470
the way it looks today which is pretty
deadly and to extend the Pierce onto the

00:15:47.470 --> 00:15:47.480
deadly and to extend the Pierce onto the
 

00:15:47.480 --> 00:15:50.890
deadly and to extend the Pierce onto the
water from again by doing that creating

00:15:50.890 --> 00:15:50.900
water from again by doing that creating
 

00:15:50.900 --> 00:15:52.690
water from again by doing that creating
a sort of series of new connections a

00:15:52.690 --> 00:15:52.700
a sort of series of new connections a
 

00:15:52.700 --> 00:15:57.040
a sort of series of new connections a
new promenade and then like trying to

00:15:57.040 --> 00:15:57.050
new promenade and then like trying to
 

00:15:57.050 --> 00:15:58.810
new promenade and then like trying to
kind of place these different locations

00:15:58.810 --> 00:15:58.820
kind of place these different locations
 

00:15:58.820 --> 00:16:00.260
kind of place these different locations
these different

00:16:00.260 --> 00:16:00.270
these different
 

00:16:00.270 --> 00:16:03.310
these different
squares in a way that would allow for a

00:16:03.310 --> 00:16:03.320
squares in a way that would allow for a
 

00:16:03.320 --> 00:16:09.140
squares in a way that would allow for a
722 to be optimized giving a few spaces

00:16:09.140 --> 00:16:09.150
722 to be optimized giving a few spaces
 

00:16:09.150 --> 00:16:11.690
722 to be optimized giving a few spaces
for actual water activities so it's not

00:16:11.690 --> 00:16:11.700
for actual water activities so it's not
 

00:16:11.700 --> 00:16:13.640
for actual water activities so it's not
a swimming pool a search but it is a

00:16:13.640 --> 00:16:13.650
a swimming pool a search but it is a
 

00:16:13.650 --> 00:16:18.320
a swimming pool a search but it is a
canoe and kayaking part and so ending up

00:16:18.320 --> 00:16:18.330
canoe and kayaking part and so ending up
 

00:16:18.330 --> 00:16:21.560
canoe and kayaking part and so ending up
with this scheme that where you can see

00:16:21.560 --> 00:16:21.570
with this scheme that where you can see
 

00:16:21.570 --> 00:16:23.480
with this scheme that where you can see
one one particular aspect is that it

00:16:23.480 --> 00:16:23.490
one one particular aspect is that it
 

00:16:23.490 --> 00:16:25.820
one one particular aspect is that it
actually Rica next to the harbour bath

00:16:25.820 --> 00:16:25.830
actually Rica next to the harbour bath
 

00:16:25.830 --> 00:16:27.790
actually Rica next to the harbour bath
unfortunately that's an aspect that we

00:16:27.790 --> 00:16:27.800
unfortunately that's an aspect that we
 

00:16:27.800 --> 00:16:31.580

fighting for still the reconnection to

00:16:31.580 --> 00:16:31.590
fighting for still the reconnection to
 

00:16:31.590 --> 00:16:33.410
fighting for still the reconnection to
the harbour bath the reason why i think

00:16:33.410 --> 00:16:33.420
the harbour bath the reason why i think
 

00:16:33.420 --> 00:16:35.180
the harbour bath the reason why i think
is really an important one is because

00:16:35.180 --> 00:16:35.190
is really an important one is because
 

00:16:35.190 --> 00:16:38.060
is really an important one is because
it's sort of a it may it gives an

it's sort of a it may it gives an
 

00:16:38.070 --> 00:16:39.830
it's sort of a it may it gives an
understanding of the city as a whole

00:16:39.830 --> 00:16:39.840
understanding of the city as a whole
 

00:16:39.840 --> 00:16:41.840

side against the other side it's very
 

00:16:43.830 --> 00:16:45.800
side against the other side it's very
much about saying okay if there's stuff

00:16:45.800 --> 00:16:45.810
much about saying okay if there's stuff
 

00:16:45.810 --> 00:16:47.570
much about saying okay if there's stuff
happening on one side we can use it and

00:16:47.570 --> 00:16:47.580
happening on one side we can use it and
 

00:16:47.580 --> 00:16:52.460
happening on one side we can use it and
drag it over onto the other side so does

00:16:52.460 --> 00:16:52.470
drag it over onto the other side so does
 

00:16:52.470 --> 00:16:54.940
drag it over onto the other side so does

00:17:46.760 --> 00:17:46.770
the day after the dutch and the italian
 

00:17:46.770 --> 00:17:49.340
the day after the dutch and the italian
team had a game and italian lost and

00:17:49.340 --> 00:17:49.350
team had a game and italian lost and
 

00:17:49.350 --> 00:17:52.640
team had a game and italian lost and
because of my name it felt like a bit of

00:17:52.640 --> 00:17:52.650
because of my name it felt like a bit of
 

00:17:52.650 --> 00:17:55.460
because of my name it felt like a bit of
an issue this map is also like a Dutch

00:17:55.460 --> 00:17:55.470
an issue this map is also like a Dutch
 

00:17:55.470 --> 00:17:59.870
an issue this map is also like a Dutch
name so i was fearing a lot of sort of

00:17:59.870 --> 00:17:59.880
name so i was fearing a lot of sort of
 

00:17:59.880 --> 00:18:01.640
name so i was fearing a lot of sort of
negative responses both from the mayor

00:18:01.640 --> 00:18:01.650
negative responses both from the mayor
 

00:18:01.650 --> 00:18:04.370
negative responses both from the mayor

side but also from the citizens and now
top of that there was this other

00:18:05.390 --> 00:18:05.400
top of that there was this other
 

00:18:05.400 --> 00:18:08.480
top of that there was this other
historical moment because i cannot hide

00:18:08.480 --> 00:18:08.490
historical moment because i cannot hide
 

00:18:08.490 --> 00:18:11.370

00:18:13.990 --> 00:18:16.530
once a half French so there is like
other situation and so I basically

00:18:16.530 --> 00:18:16.540
other situation and so I basically
 

00:18:16.540 --> 00:18:18.330
other situation and so I basically
showed this picture to these people so

00:18:18.330 --> 00:18:18.340
showed this picture to these people so
 

00:18:18.340 --> 00:18:20.670
showed this picture to these people so
explaining that this was not so much

00:18:20.670 --> 00:18:20.680
explaining that this was not so much
 

00:18:20.680 --> 00:18:23.370
explaining that this was not so much
about you know who I was or where I was

00:18:23.370 --> 00:18:23.380
about you know who I was or where I was
 

00:18:23.380 --> 00:18:24.960
about you know who I was or where I was
coming from but much more about their

00:18:24.960 --> 00:18:24.970
coming from but much more about their
 

00:18:24.970 --> 00:18:28.500
coming from but much more about their
own issues and the city of remedy is an

00:18:28.500 --> 00:18:28.510
own issues and the city of remedy is an
 

00:18:28.510 --> 00:18:30.420
own issues and the city of remedy is an
interesting place because historically

00:18:30.420 --> 00:18:30.430
interesting place because historically
 

00:18:30.430 --> 00:18:31.860
interesting place because historically
in Europe I was like one of the first

00:18:31.860 --> 00:18:31.870
in Europe I was like one of the first
 

00:18:31.870 --> 00:18:34.860

of dying out as a as a person place and
 

00:18:41.890 --> 00:18:45.830
of dying out as a as a person place and
it's more becoming as a kind of family

00:18:45.830 --> 00:18:45.840
it's more becoming as a kind of family
 

00:18:45.840 --> 00:18:48.810
it's more becoming as a kind of family
holiday place and the mayor of course

00:18:48.810 --> 00:18:48.820
holiday place and the mayor of course
 

00:18:48.820 --> 00:18:50.720

still waiting for results the program is

00:19:14.160 --> 00:19:14.170
still waiting for results the program is
 

00:19:14.170 --> 00:19:16.080
still waiting for results the program is
like a series of you know cultural

00:19:16.080 --> 00:19:16.090
like a series of you know cultural
 

00:19:16.090 --> 00:19:19.830
like a series of you know cultural
venues and then a lot of restaurants and

00:19:19.830 --> 00:19:19.840
venues and then a lot of restaurants and
 

00:19:19.840 --> 00:19:23.370
venues and then a lot of restaurants and
shops and public spaces and the ideas

00:19:23.370 --> 00:19:23.380
shops and public spaces and the ideas
 

00:19:23.380 --> 00:19:25.890
shops and public spaces and the ideas
that we had was to come and look at the

00:19:25.890 --> 00:19:25.900
that we had was to come and look at the
 

00:19:25.900 --> 00:19:28.110
that we had was to come and look at the
site as what it is which is pretty much

00:19:28.110 --> 00:19:28.120
site as what it is which is pretty much
 

00:19:28.120 --> 00:19:31.620
site as what it is which is pretty much
a divided between two cities the one is

00:19:31.620 --> 00:19:31.630
a divided between two cities the one is
 

00:19:31.630 --> 00:19:33.330
a divided between two cities the one is
you know the historical city of you see

00:19:33.330 --> 00:19:33.340
you know the historical city of you see
 

00:19:33.340 --> 00:19:34.740
you know the historical city of you see
and the other one is the beach city

00:19:34.740 --> 00:19:34.750
and the other one is the beach city
 

00:19:34.750 --> 00:19:37.350
and the other one is the beach city
which is literally a city and that's

00:19:37.350 --> 00:19:37.360
which is literally a city and that's
 

00:19:37.360 --> 00:19:39.570
which is literally a city and that's
what it's kind of exceptional about it

00:19:39.570 --> 00:19:39.580
what it's kind of exceptional about it
 

00:19:39.580 --> 00:19:41.730
what it's kind of exceptional about it
there's so many buildings they actually

00:19:41.730 --> 00:19:41.740
there's so many buildings they actually
 

00:19:41.740 --> 00:19:43.110
there's so many buildings they actually
have addresses they actually have

00:19:43.110 --> 00:19:43.120
have addresses they actually have
 

00:19:43.120 --> 00:19:45.600
have addresses they actually have
numbers you know for these buildings are

00:19:45.600 --> 00:19:45.610
numbers you know for these buildings are
 

00:19:45.610 --> 00:19:47.550
numbers you know for these buildings are
of course not real buildings that are

00:19:47.550 --> 00:19:47.560
of course not real buildings that are
 

00:19:47.560 --> 00:19:51.450
of course not real buildings that are
shags where you can you know they get a

00:19:51.450 --> 00:19:51.460
shags where you can you know they get a
 

00:19:51.460 --> 00:19:53.820
shags where you can you know they get a
drink or change or have restrooms

00:19:53.820 --> 00:19:53.830
drink or change or have restrooms
 

00:19:53.830 --> 00:19:57.210
drink or change or have restrooms
different things and then the issue is

00:19:57.210 --> 00:19:57.220
different things and then the issue is
 

00:19:57.220 --> 00:20:00.150
different things and then the issue is
basically how do how do we deal with the

00:20:00.150 --> 00:20:00.160
basically how do how do we deal with the
 

00:20:00.160 --> 00:20:02.880
basically how do how do we deal with the
connection along the sea and across from

00:20:02.880 --> 00:20:02.890
connection along the sea and across from
 

00:20:02.890 --> 00:20:06.570
connection along the sea and across from
that city to the other one so we have

00:20:06.570 --> 00:20:06.580
that city to the other one so we have
 

00:20:06.580 --> 00:20:08.100
that city to the other one so we have
this situation that if you walk along

00:20:08.100 --> 00:20:08.110
this situation that if you walk along
 

00:20:08.110 --> 00:20:10.560
this situation that if you walk along
the sea along their kind of waterfront

00:20:10.560 --> 00:20:10.570
the sea along their kind of waterfront
 

00:20:10.570 --> 00:20:12.390
the sea along their kind of waterfront
you don't see the sea you don't have any

00:20:12.390 --> 00:20:12.400
you don't see the sea you don't have any
 

00:20:12.400 --> 00:20:14.430
you don't see the sea you don't have any
relationship to it because of this other

00:20:14.430 --> 00:20:14.440
relationship to it because of this other
 

00:20:14.440 --> 00:20:18.760
relationship to it because of this other
one story city that kind of stretches

00:20:18.760 --> 00:20:18.770
one story city that kind of stretches
 

00:20:18.770 --> 00:20:22.090
one story city that kind of stretches
the water from so we decided to do

00:20:22.090 --> 00:20:22.100
the water from so we decided to do
 

00:20:22.100 --> 00:20:24.190
the water from so we decided to do
something that would actually allow from

00:20:24.190 --> 00:20:24.200
something that would actually allow from
 

00:20:24.200 --> 00:20:26.970
something that would actually allow from
going you know down and up allow from

00:20:26.970 --> 00:20:26.980
going you know down and up allow from
 

00:20:26.980 --> 00:20:30.310
going you know down and up allow from
the idea of like sort of relating

00:20:30.310 --> 00:20:30.320
the idea of like sort of relating
 

00:20:30.320 --> 00:20:33.100
the idea of like sort of relating
visually to to the sea but also can

00:20:33.100 --> 00:20:33.110
visually to to the sea but also can
 

00:20:33.110 --> 00:20:35.800
visually to to the sea but also can
physically to the city behind and then

00:20:35.800 --> 00:20:35.810
physically to the city behind and then
 

00:20:35.810 --> 00:20:38.350
physically to the city behind and then
we made like a bunch of studies for that

00:20:38.350 --> 00:20:38.360
we made like a bunch of studies for that
 

00:20:38.360 --> 00:20:42.070
we made like a bunch of studies for that
which we always do in order to get to

00:20:42.070 --> 00:20:42.080
which we always do in order to get to
 

00:20:42.080 --> 00:20:44.410
which we always do in order to get to
some sort of idea of a you know what

00:20:44.410 --> 00:20:44.420
some sort of idea of a you know what
 

00:20:44.420 --> 00:20:46.570
some sort of idea of a you know what
could what could work what could be an

could what could work what could be an
 

00:20:46.580 --> 00:20:48.940
could what could work what could be an
inspiration in this case it was very

00:20:48.940 --> 00:20:48.950
inspiration in this case it was very
 

00:20:48.950 --> 00:20:52.000
inspiration in this case it was very
literal the bullet marks you know

00:20:52.000 --> 00:20:52.010
literal the bullet marks you know
 

00:20:52.010 --> 00:20:54.520
literal the bullet marks you know
pattern of a Copacabana is extremely

00:20:54.520 --> 00:20:54.530
pattern of a Copacabana is extremely
 

00:20:54.530 --> 00:20:56.200
pattern of a Copacabana is extremely
interesting because it's the perfect and

00:20:56.200 --> 00:20:56.210
interesting because it's the perfect and

a contraction of a long and a sort of

00:20:59.490 --> 00:20:59.500
a contraction of a long and a sort of
 

00:20:59.500 --> 00:21:02.770
a contraction of a long and a sort of
transversal axis so we started exploring

00:21:02.770 --> 00:21:02.780
transversal axis so we started exploring
 

00:21:02.780 --> 00:21:06.340
transversal axis so we started exploring
this condition and develop it almost

00:21:06.340 --> 00:21:06.350
this condition and develop it almost
 

00:21:06.350 --> 00:21:09.970
this condition and develop it almost
sort of naturally over the whole site in

00:21:09.970 --> 00:21:09.980
sort of naturally over the whole site in
 

00:21:09.980 --> 00:21:13.080
sort of naturally over the whole site in
order to create these two conditions

00:21:13.080 --> 00:21:13.090
order to create these two conditions
 

00:21:13.090 --> 00:21:16.750
order to create these two conditions
this is the program breakdown and what's

00:21:16.750 --> 00:21:16.760
this is the program breakdown and what's
 

00:21:16.760 --> 00:21:19.330
this is the program breakdown and what's
interesting is that the fabric of it is

00:21:19.330 --> 00:21:19.340
interesting is that the fabric of it is
 

00:21:19.340 --> 00:21:21.850
interesting is that the fabric of it is
very similar but as you splice it and

00:21:21.850 --> 00:21:21.860
very similar but as you splice it and
 

00:21:21.860 --> 00:21:23.680
very similar but as you splice it and
work with it in a three-dimensional way

00:21:23.680 --> 00:21:23.690
work with it in a three-dimensional way
 

00:21:23.690 --> 00:21:27.430
work with it in a three-dimensional way
you start playing with its edges or like

00:21:27.430 --> 00:21:27.440
you start playing with its edges or like
 

00:21:27.440 --> 00:21:29.590
you start playing with its edges or like
it'sit's kind of extremes to the point

00:21:29.590 --> 00:21:29.600
it'sit's kind of extremes to the point
 

00:21:29.600 --> 00:21:32.530
it'sit's kind of extremes to the point
of having here on the edge a sort of a

00:21:32.530 --> 00:21:32.540
of having here on the edge a sort of a
 

00:21:32.540 --> 00:21:35.080
of having here on the edge a sort of a
hotel of nine stories that you know it's

00:21:35.080 --> 00:21:35.090
hotel of nine stories that you know it's
 

00:21:35.090 --> 00:21:37.210
hotel of nine stories that you know it's
like a real sort of mount you can climb

00:21:37.210 --> 00:21:37.220
like a real sort of mount you can climb
 

00:21:37.220 --> 00:21:40.050
like a real sort of mount you can climb
it if you if you have the condition for

00:21:40.050 --> 00:21:40.060
it if you if you have the condition for
 

00:21:40.060 --> 00:21:43.180
it if you if you have the condition for
but it's a it's exactly the same sort of

00:21:43.180 --> 00:21:43.190
but it's a it's exactly the same sort of
 

00:21:43.190 --> 00:21:48.940
but it's a it's exactly the same sort of
fabric as the rest of the project so

00:21:48.940 --> 00:21:48.950
fabric as the rest of the project so
 

00:21:48.950 --> 00:21:52.240
fabric as the rest of the project so
within that footprint that's very even

00:21:52.240 --> 00:21:52.250
within that footprint that's very even
 

00:21:52.250 --> 00:21:53.650
within that footprint that's very even
there's a lot of conditions that can

00:21:53.650 --> 00:21:53.660
there's a lot of conditions that can
 

00:21:53.660 --> 00:21:56.620
there's a lot of conditions that can
occur and these conditions are happening

00:21:56.620 --> 00:21:56.630
occur and these conditions are happening
 

00:21:56.630 --> 00:21:59.050
occur and these conditions are happening
in a three-dimensional manner where you

00:21:59.050 --> 00:21:59.060

00:26:23.920 --> 00:26:25.800
total openness what we believe is that
this neighborhood needs to have a

00:26:25.800 --> 00:26:25.810
this neighborhood needs to have a
 

00:26:25.810 --> 00:26:29.400
this neighborhood needs to have a
certain return of you know neighbors

00:26:29.400 --> 00:26:29.410
certain return of you know neighbors
 

00:26:29.410 --> 00:26:33.300
certain return of you know neighbors
taking over their own spaces which is

00:26:33.300 --> 00:26:33.310
taking over their own spaces which is
 

00:26:33.310 --> 00:26:35.100
taking over their own spaces which is
currently not happening at all so that

00:26:35.100 --> 00:26:35.110
currently not happening at all so that
 

00:26:35.110 --> 00:26:37.470
currently not happening at all so that
the project would actually allow for you

00:26:37.470 --> 00:26:37.480
the project would actually allow for you
 

00:26:37.480 --> 00:26:39.510
the project would actually allow for you
know series of activities to occur and

00:26:39.510 --> 00:26:39.520
know series of activities to occur and
 

00:26:39.520 --> 00:26:42.750
know series of activities to occur and
therefore it's sort of more natural type

00:26:42.750 --> 00:26:42.760
therefore it's sort of more natural type
 

00:26:42.760 --> 00:26:46.770
therefore it's sort of more natural type
of control on the side there is also one

00:26:46.770 --> 00:26:46.780
of control on the side there is also one
 

00:26:46.780 --> 00:26:49.410
of control on the side there is also one
big requirement was that the the

00:26:49.410 --> 00:26:49.420
big requirement was that the the
 

00:26:49.420 --> 00:26:51.060
big requirement was that the the
settings were supposed to be or are

00:26:51.060 --> 00:26:51.070
settings were supposed to be or are
 

00:26:51.070 --> 00:26:54.500

needed to be dealt with so in the end

00:27:03.180 --> 00:27:03.190
needed to be dealt with so in the end
 

00:27:03.190 --> 00:27:05.160
needed to be dealt with so in the end
the project is ending up as kind of

00:27:05.160 --> 00:27:05.170
the project is ending up as kind of
 

00:27:05.170 --> 00:27:09.690
the project is ending up as kind of
pretty simple a loop of four strains

00:27:09.690 --> 00:27:09.700

what's sad about yeah this is better
like here you can see that it sort of

00:27:24.240 --> 00:27:24.250
like here you can see that it sort of
 

00:27:24.250 --> 00:27:28.169
like here you can see that it sort of
links the whole park connections from

00:27:28.169 --> 00:27:28.179
links the whole park connections from
 

00:27:28.179 --> 00:27:30.570

bull amount which actually surrounds the

00:27:30.570 --> 00:27:30.580
bull amount which actually surrounds the
 

00:27:30.580 --> 00:27:37.080
bull amount which actually surrounds the
whole bay so unfortunately this project

00:27:37.080 --> 00:27:37.090
whole bay so unfortunately this project
 

00:27:37.090 --> 00:27:40.650
whole bay so unfortunately this project
we recently heard we lost so it's not

00:27:40.650 --> 00:27:40.660
we recently heard we lost so it's not
 

00:27:40.660 --> 00:27:42.810
we recently heard we lost so it's not
going to happen at least not going to

00:27:42.810 --> 00:27:42.820
going to happen at least not going to
 

00:27:42.820 --> 00:27:46.020
going to happen at least not going to
happen like that some local guy get get

00:27:46.020 --> 00:27:46.030
happen like that some local guy get get
 

00:27:46.030 --> 00:27:49.169
happen like that some local guy get get
the job but we're looking forward to

00:27:49.169 --> 00:27:49.179
the job but we're looking forward to
 

00:27:49.179 --> 00:27:54.730
the job but we're looking forward to
seeing to see what they came up with

00:27:54.730 --> 00:27:54.740
 
 

00:27:54.740 --> 00:27:57.460
 
which brings me to a actually a series

00:27:57.460 --> 00:27:57.470
which brings me to a actually a series
 

00:27:57.470 --> 00:28:00.250
which brings me to a actually a series
of the performative architecture that

00:28:00.250 --> 00:28:00.260
of the performative architecture that
 

00:28:00.260 --> 00:28:02.650
of the performative architecture that
also will never perform it's a three

00:28:02.650 --> 00:28:02.660
also will never perform it's a three
 

00:28:02.660 --> 00:28:05.380
also will never perform it's a three
projects that we've been I working on

00:28:05.380 --> 00:28:05.390
projects that we've been I working on
 

00:28:05.390 --> 00:28:07.960
projects that we've been I working on
there are all lost projects but I think

00:28:07.960 --> 00:28:07.970
there are all lost projects but I think
 

00:28:07.970 --> 00:28:09.910
there are all lost projects but I think
are interesting because first I've never

00:28:09.910 --> 00:28:09.920
are interesting because first I've never
 

00:28:09.920 --> 00:28:12.330
are interesting because first I've never
shown them the recent projects and

00:28:12.330 --> 00:28:12.340
shown them the recent projects and
 

00:28:12.340 --> 00:28:16.299
shown them the recent projects and
except from one of them and secondly I

00:28:16.299 --> 00:28:16.309
except from one of them and secondly I
 

00:28:16.309 --> 00:28:18.760
except from one of them and secondly I
think it's also like it's interesting to

00:28:18.760 --> 00:28:18.770
think it's also like it's interesting to
 

00:28:18.770 --> 00:28:21.210
think it's also like it's interesting to
see that you know within the practice we

00:28:21.210 --> 00:28:21.220
see that you know within the practice we
 

00:28:21.220 --> 00:28:23.230
see that you know within the practice we
we try to achieve something that

00:28:23.230 --> 00:28:23.240
we try to achieve something that
 

00:28:23.240 --> 00:28:25.690
we try to achieve something that
sometimes doesn't really get to where it

00:28:25.690 --> 00:28:25.700
sometimes doesn't really get to where it
 

00:28:25.700 --> 00:28:28.810
sometimes doesn't really get to where it
should be but it's an important aspect

00:28:28.810 --> 00:28:28.820
should be but it's an important aspect
 

00:28:28.820 --> 00:28:31.690
should be but it's an important aspect
of the project if you take this this is

00:28:31.690 --> 00:28:31.700
of the project if you take this this is
 

00:28:31.700 --> 00:28:34.419
of the project if you take this this is
a beirut so it's a project for the

00:28:34.419 --> 00:28:34.429
a beirut so it's a project for the
 

00:28:34.429 --> 00:28:40.540
a beirut so it's a project for the
performing arts house in beirut and it's

00:28:40.540 --> 00:28:40.550
performing arts house in beirut and it's
 

00:28:40.550 --> 00:28:42.280
performing arts house in beirut and it's
a site that's very special because it's

00:28:42.280 --> 00:28:42.290
a site that's very special because it's
 

00:28:42.290 --> 00:28:44.500
a site that's very special because it's
located on one side you have you know a

00:28:44.500 --> 00:28:44.510
located on one side you have you know a
 

00:28:44.510 --> 00:28:47.380
located on one side you have you know a
Skyway or sort of a highway that divides

00:28:47.380 --> 00:28:47.390
Skyway or sort of a highway that divides
 

00:28:47.390 --> 00:28:50.890
Skyway or sort of a highway that divides
really two neighborhoods one is the new

00:28:50.890 --> 00:28:50.900
really two neighborhoods one is the new
 

00:28:50.900 --> 00:28:54.430
really two neighborhoods one is the new
BCD be huge central district which is

00:28:54.430 --> 00:28:54.440
BCD be huge central district which is
 

00:28:54.440 --> 00:28:57.880
BCD be huge central district which is
you know very incredible the kind of

00:28:57.880 --> 00:28:57.890
you know very incredible the kind of
 

00:28:57.890 --> 00:29:00.100
you know very incredible the kind of
developing a ground and the other one is

00:29:00.100 --> 00:29:00.110
developing a ground and the other one is
 

00:29:00.110 --> 00:29:03.070
developing a ground and the other one is
this sort of like most of historical

00:29:03.070 --> 00:29:03.080
this sort of like most of historical
 

00:29:03.080 --> 00:29:09.660
this sort of like most of historical
neighborhood that's somewhat left as is

00:29:09.660 --> 00:29:09.670
neighborhood that's somewhat left as is
 

00:29:09.670 --> 00:29:13.390
neighborhood that's somewhat left as is
the site was of course regulated very

00:29:13.390 --> 00:29:13.400
the site was of course regulated very
 

00:29:13.400 --> 00:29:14.980
the site was of course regulated very
specifically what we decided is to

00:29:14.980 --> 00:29:14.990
specifically what we decided is to
 

00:29:14.990 --> 00:29:19.060
specifically what we decided is to
actually try to take an abstract first

00:29:19.060 --> 00:29:19.070
actually try to take an abstract first
 

00:29:19.070 --> 00:29:22.150
actually try to take an abstract first
take on the on the project and do this

00:29:22.150 --> 00:29:22.160
take on the on the project and do this
 

00:29:22.160 --> 00:29:26.290
take on the on the project and do this
kind of 40 by 40 queue full volume and

00:29:26.290 --> 00:29:26.300
kind of 40 by 40 queue full volume and
 

00:29:26.300 --> 00:29:27.660
kind of 40 by 40 queue full volume and
try to see what we could do with it

00:29:27.660 --> 00:29:27.670
try to see what we could do with it
 

00:29:27.670 --> 00:29:30.220
try to see what we could do with it
there's a series of programs that are

00:29:30.220 --> 00:29:30.230
there's a series of programs that are
 

00:29:30.230 --> 00:29:32.740
there's a series of programs that are
required and of course it's a it's

00:29:32.740 --> 00:29:32.750
required and of course it's a it's
 

00:29:32.750 --> 00:29:34.630
required and of course it's a it's
pretty exciting a condition because it's

00:29:34.630 --> 00:29:34.640
pretty exciting a condition because it's
 

00:29:34.640 --> 00:29:38.290
pretty exciting a condition because it's
all sort of performing and art programs

00:29:38.290 --> 00:29:38.300
all sort of performing and art programs
 

00:29:38.300 --> 00:29:40.660
all sort of performing and art programs
another thing that was maybe your thing

00:29:40.660 --> 00:29:40.670
another thing that was maybe your thing
 

00:29:40.670 --> 00:29:42.490
another thing that was maybe your thing
I was much more interesting about the

00:29:42.490 --> 00:29:42.500
I was much more interesting about the
 

00:29:42.500 --> 00:29:45.270
I was much more interesting about the
whole brief was that they outline a

00:29:45.270 --> 00:29:45.280
whole brief was that they outline a
 

00:29:45.280 --> 00:29:49.960
whole brief was that they outline a
specificity of the of the Beirut art

00:29:49.960 --> 00:29:49.970
specificity of the of the Beirut art
 

00:29:49.970 --> 00:29:53.919
specificity of the of the Beirut art
scene is that they have a lot of street

00:29:53.919 --> 00:29:53.929
scene is that they have a lot of street
 

00:29:53.929 --> 00:29:56.799
scene is that they have a lot of street
art happening our street performances so

00:29:56.799 --> 00:29:56.809
art happening our street performances so
 

00:29:56.809 --> 00:29:58.710
art happening our street performances so
what we started looking at is ways to

00:29:58.710 --> 00:29:58.720
what we started looking at is ways to
 

00:29:58.720 --> 00:30:02.950
what we started looking at is ways to
put the program together in in in a

00:30:02.950 --> 00:30:02.960
put the program together in in in a
 

00:30:02.960 --> 00:30:04.780
put the program together in in in a
manner that would allow for some sort of

00:30:04.780 --> 00:30:04.790
manner that would allow for some sort of
 

00:30:04.790 --> 00:30:05.610
manner that would allow for some sort of
a perazzi

00:30:05.610 --> 00:30:05.620
a perazzi
 

00:30:05.620 --> 00:30:08.460
a perazzi
or some elements of porosity within the

00:30:08.460 --> 00:30:08.470
or some elements of porosity within the
 

00:30:08.470 --> 00:30:11.070
or some elements of porosity within the
building these kind of various decks of

00:30:11.070 --> 00:30:11.080
building these kind of various decks of
 

00:30:11.080 --> 00:30:13.610
building these kind of various decks of
various terrazas that will allow for

00:30:13.610 --> 00:30:13.620
various terrazas that will allow for
 

00:30:13.620 --> 00:30:17.430
various terrazas that will allow for
public performances to occur so this is

00:30:17.430 --> 00:30:17.440
public performances to occur so this is
 

00:30:17.440 --> 00:30:20.190
public performances to occur so this is
the sort of volume that we ended up with

00:30:20.190 --> 00:30:20.200
the sort of volume that we ended up with
 

00:30:20.200 --> 00:30:22.700
the sort of volume that we ended up with
that allows for you know an entrance

00:30:22.700 --> 00:30:22.710
that allows for you know an entrance
 

00:30:22.710 --> 00:30:25.320
that allows for you know an entrance
front and back that would be an open

00:30:25.320 --> 00:30:25.330
front and back that would be an open
 

00:30:25.330 --> 00:30:27.450
front and back that would be an open
entrance that would allow for anything

00:30:27.450 --> 00:30:27.460
entrance that would allow for anything
 

00:30:27.460 --> 00:30:29.460
entrance that would allow for anything
to happen and then a kind of Shiraz deck

00:30:29.460 --> 00:30:29.470
to happen and then a kind of Shiraz deck
 

00:30:29.470 --> 00:30:32.490
to happen and then a kind of Shiraz deck
that also allows for for public

00:30:32.490 --> 00:30:32.500
that also allows for for public
 

00:30:32.500 --> 00:30:35.549
that also allows for for public
performances so you have the kind of

00:30:35.549 --> 00:30:35.559
performances so you have the kind of
 

00:30:35.559 --> 00:30:38.970
performances so you have the kind of
conditions of you and then the way you

00:30:38.970 --> 00:30:38.980
conditions of you and then the way you
 

00:30:38.980 --> 00:30:40.380
conditions of you and then the way you
circulate through the building is

00:30:40.380 --> 00:30:40.390
circulate through the building is
 

00:30:40.390 --> 00:30:44.880
circulate through the building is
actually abdo so you can get from one to

00:30:44.880 --> 00:30:44.890
actually abdo so you can get from one to
 

00:30:44.890 --> 00:30:47.180
actually abdo so you can get from one to
the other of these sort of open spaces

00:30:47.180 --> 00:30:47.190
the other of these sort of open spaces
 

00:30:47.190 --> 00:30:51.720
the other of these sort of open spaces
out door and then you get into the real

00:30:51.720 --> 00:30:51.730
out door and then you get into the real
 

00:30:51.730 --> 00:30:54.120
out door and then you get into the real
sort of official performance spaces that

00:30:54.120 --> 00:30:54.130
sort of official performance spaces that
 

00:30:54.130 --> 00:30:57.150
sort of official performance spaces that
are in a way symbolically a it's

00:30:57.150 --> 00:30:57.160

00:30:57.160 --> 00:30:58.950
are in a way symbolically a it's
unfortunate that then they end up being

00:30:58.950 --> 00:30:58.960
unfortunate that then they end up being
 

00:30:58.960 --> 00:31:01.620
unfortunate that then they end up being
on the top because of course it's what

00:31:01.620 --> 00:31:01.630
on the top because of course it's what
 

00:31:01.630 --> 00:31:04.140
on the top because of course it's what
we want to show is that the main thing

00:31:04.140 --> 00:31:04.150
we want to show is that the main thing
 

00:31:04.150 --> 00:31:08.520
we want to show is that the main thing
is the sort of voice but that there's

00:31:08.520 --> 00:31:08.530
is the sort of voice but that there's
 

00:31:08.530 --> 00:31:10.799
is the sort of voice but that there's
also some practical issues so this is

00:31:10.799 --> 00:31:10.809
also some practical issues so this is
 

00:31:10.809 --> 00:31:17.010
also some practical issues so this is
you know the way the place should be and

00:31:17.010 --> 00:31:17.020
you know the way the place should be and
 

00:31:17.020 --> 00:31:18.299
you know the way the place should be and
if you look at it I mean it's a building

00:31:18.299 --> 00:31:18.309
if you look at it I mean it's a building
 

00:31:18.309 --> 00:31:21.049
if you look at it I mean it's a building
that's mostly a experience in section

00:31:21.049 --> 00:31:21.059
that's mostly a experience in section
 

00:31:21.059 --> 00:31:25.080
that's mostly a experience in section
you have these sort of the big holes and

00:31:25.080 --> 00:31:25.090
you have these sort of the big holes and
 

00:31:25.090 --> 00:31:26.850
you have these sort of the big holes and
the exhibition spaces and the theatre

00:31:26.850 --> 00:31:26.860
the exhibition spaces and the theatre
 

00:31:26.860 --> 00:31:29.070
the exhibition spaces and the theatre
here the cinema but then mostly is these

sort of voids that are orchestrating or

00:31:32.250 --> 00:31:32.260
sort of voids that are orchestrating or
 

00:31:32.260 --> 00:31:36.960
sort of voids that are orchestrating or
organizing the actual solids so that's

00:31:36.960 --> 00:31:36.970
organizing the actual solids so that's
 

00:31:36.970 --> 00:31:39.810
organizing the actual solids so that's
the view from the back when you have you

00:31:39.810 --> 00:31:39.820
the view from the back when you have you
 

00:31:39.820 --> 00:31:43.200

the top stage or the top to us that's
 

00:31:48.070 --> 00:31:50.130
the top stage or the top to us that's
the kind of lobby where you know the

00:31:50.130 --> 00:31:50.140
the kind of lobby where you know the
 

00:31:50.140 --> 00:31:53.549
the kind of lobby where you know the

very basic I'm going to go through in
 

00:32:06.120 --> 00:32:09.260
very basic I'm going to go through in
detail but in the section again I mean

00:32:09.260 --> 00:32:09.270
detail but in the section again I mean
 

00:32:09.270 --> 00:32:11.390
detail but in the section again I mean
you get to see the the idea of the

you get to see the the idea of the
 

00:32:11.400 --> 00:32:16.760
you get to see the the idea of the
project we have no entrance hall back

00:32:16.760 --> 00:32:16.770

mean I think in the Beirut wonders like

00:32:45.110 --> 00:32:45.120
mean I think in the Beirut wonders like
 

00:32:45.120 --> 00:32:47.930
mean I think in the Beirut wonders like
it was like six hundred and more soup

00:32:47.930 --> 00:32:47.940
it was like six hundred and more soup
 

00:32:47.940 --> 00:32:50.210
it was like six hundred and more soup
metal in this one I don't know how many

00:32:50.210 --> 00:32:50.220
metal in this one I don't know how many
 

00:32:50.220 --> 00:32:52.640
metal in this one I don't know how many
but it was also quite a few what was

00:32:52.640 --> 00:32:52.650
but it was also quite a few what was
 

00:32:52.650 --> 00:32:54.530
but it was also quite a few what was
interesting for us was that the project

00:32:54.530 --> 00:32:54.540
interesting for us was that the project
 

00:32:54.540 --> 00:32:57.500
interesting for us was that the project
was actually suggesting that it would be

00:32:57.500 --> 00:32:57.510
was actually suggesting that it would be
 

00:32:57.510 --> 00:33:00.950
was actually suggesting that it would be
it's a pop music center so I mean I

00:33:00.950 --> 00:33:00.960
it's a pop music center so I mean I
 

00:33:00.960 --> 00:33:03.070
it's a pop music center so I mean I
don't know actually much about pop music

00:33:03.070 --> 00:33:03.080
don't know actually much about pop music
 

00:33:03.080 --> 00:33:06.920
don't know actually much about pop music
but they come a condition that

00:33:06.920 --> 00:33:06.930
but they come a condition that
 

00:33:06.930 --> 00:33:09.380
but they come a condition that
interested me the most was this divide

00:33:09.380 --> 00:33:09.390
interested me the most was this divide
 

00:33:09.390 --> 00:33:12.200
interested me the most was this divide
in between having an open air scene of

00:33:12.200 --> 00:33:12.210
in between having an open air scene of
 

00:33:12.210 --> 00:33:15.200
in between having an open air scene of
stage in an indoor stage and how we

00:33:15.200 --> 00:33:15.210
stage in an indoor stage and how we
 

00:33:15.210 --> 00:33:18.170
stage in an indoor stage and how we
could sort of place that into a side

00:33:18.170 --> 00:33:18.180
could sort of place that into a side
 

00:33:18.180 --> 00:33:20.240
could sort of place that into a side
there was pretty complex you know one

00:33:20.240 --> 00:33:20.250
there was pretty complex you know one
 

00:33:20.250 --> 00:33:23.030
there was pretty complex you know one
half was on a one side of a busy road

00:33:23.030 --> 00:33:23.040
half was on a one side of a busy road
 

00:33:23.040 --> 00:33:25.340
half was on a one side of a busy road
the other one on the other side and it

00:33:25.340 --> 00:33:25.350
the other one on the other side and it
 

00:33:25.350 --> 00:33:28.070
the other one on the other side and it
was sort of a challenge to deal with

00:33:28.070 --> 00:33:28.080
was sort of a challenge to deal with
 

00:33:28.080 --> 00:33:29.750
was sort of a challenge to deal with
that so what we did is actually trying

00:33:29.750 --> 00:33:29.760
that so what we did is actually trying
 

00:33:29.760 --> 00:33:32.780
that so what we did is actually trying
to make an urban form or like an urban

00:33:32.780 --> 00:33:32.790
to make an urban form or like an urban
 

00:33:32.790 --> 00:33:34.270
to make an urban form or like an urban
project that would deal with these

00:33:34.270 --> 00:33:34.280
project that would deal with these
 

00:33:34.280 --> 00:33:36.980
project that would deal with these
conditions and then take advantage of it

00:33:36.980 --> 00:33:36.990
conditions and then take advantage of it
 

00:33:36.990 --> 00:33:38.950
conditions and then take advantage of it
in order to create a sort of an

00:33:38.950 --> 00:33:38.960
in order to create a sort of an
 

00:33:38.960 --> 00:33:42.620
in order to create a sort of an
unexpected condition of two stages

00:33:42.620 --> 00:33:42.630
unexpected condition of two stages
 

00:33:42.630 --> 00:33:44.750
unexpected condition of two stages
facing each other across the void so

00:33:44.750 --> 00:33:44.760
facing each other across the void so
 

00:33:44.760 --> 00:33:46.130
facing each other across the void so
that void would be the place where

00:33:46.130 --> 00:33:46.140
that void would be the place where
 

00:33:46.140 --> 00:33:49.700
that void would be the place where
anything could happen and anything could

00:33:49.700 --> 00:33:49.710
anything could happen and anything could
 

00:33:49.710 --> 00:33:51.770
anything could happen and anything could
be from universe Porter them to other

00:33:51.770 --> 00:33:51.780
be from universe Porter them to other
 

00:33:51.780 --> 00:33:55.130
be from universe Porter them to other
than two big gatherings and so we

00:33:55.130 --> 00:33:55.140
than two big gatherings and so we
 

00:33:55.140 --> 00:33:57.380
than two big gatherings and so we
basically resolve all the other program

00:33:57.380 --> 00:33:57.390
basically resolve all the other program
 

00:33:57.390 --> 00:33:57.740
basically resolve all the other program
like

00:33:57.740 --> 00:33:57.750
like
 

00:33:57.750 --> 00:33:59.420
like
all the offices and all the kind of

00:33:59.420 --> 00:33:59.430
all the offices and all the kind of
 

00:33:59.430 --> 00:34:01.340
all the offices and all the kind of
facilities that were required in order

00:34:01.340 --> 00:34:01.350
facilities that were required in order
 

00:34:01.350 --> 00:34:05.000
facilities that were required in order
to get that that sort of a project to

00:34:05.000 --> 00:34:05.010
to get that that sort of a project to
 

00:34:05.010 --> 00:34:07.940
to get that that sort of a project to
run we use those in order to feel you

00:34:07.940 --> 00:34:07.950
run we use those in order to feel you
 

00:34:07.950 --> 00:34:09.830
run we use those in order to feel you
know the connections are like the sort

00:34:09.830 --> 00:34:09.840
know the connections are like the sort
 

00:34:09.840 --> 00:34:11.720
know the connections are like the sort
of across the street connections that

00:34:11.720 --> 00:34:11.730
of across the street connections that
 

00:34:11.730 --> 00:34:15.649
of across the street connections that
were required for the project so you

00:34:15.649 --> 00:34:15.659
were required for the project so you
 

00:34:15.659 --> 00:34:20.149
were required for the project so you
have this urban escape let's say and

00:34:20.149 --> 00:34:20.159
have this urban escape let's say and
 

00:34:20.159 --> 00:34:22.210
have this urban escape let's say and
then this sort of a public space

00:34:22.210 --> 00:34:22.220
then this sort of a public space
 

00:34:22.220 --> 00:34:27.770
then this sort of a public space
condition of avoid sort of two stages

00:34:27.770 --> 00:34:27.780
condition of avoid sort of two stages
 

00:34:27.780 --> 00:34:30.889
condition of avoid sort of two stages
facing each other across avoid over

00:34:30.889 --> 00:34:30.899
facing each other across avoid over
 

00:34:30.899 --> 00:34:33.320
facing each other across avoid over
viewing the city and connecting on to

00:34:33.320 --> 00:34:33.330
viewing the city and connecting on to
 

00:34:33.330 --> 00:34:36.830
viewing the city and connecting on to
the parks and then we had to design also

00:34:36.830 --> 00:34:36.840
the parks and then we had to design also
 

00:34:36.840 --> 00:34:40.040
the parks and then we had to design also
the full site in terms of parks so we

00:34:40.040 --> 00:34:40.050
the full site in terms of parks so we
 

00:34:40.050 --> 00:34:41.840
the full site in terms of parks so we
decided to of course work with this

00:34:41.840 --> 00:34:41.850
decided to of course work with this
 

00:34:41.850 --> 00:34:47.530
decided to of course work with this
similar kind of typology of a spaces

00:34:47.530 --> 00:34:47.540
similar kind of typology of a spaces
 

00:34:47.540 --> 00:34:54.409
similar kind of typology of a spaces
just going through quickly so well this

00:34:54.409 --> 00:34:54.419
just going through quickly so well this
 

00:34:54.419 --> 00:34:57.260
just going through quickly so well this
is very burnt but basically these are

00:34:57.260 --> 00:34:57.270
is very burnt but basically these are
 

00:34:57.270 --> 00:34:59.900
is very burnt but basically these are
like all the sort of boring spaces you

00:34:59.900 --> 00:34:59.910
like all the sort of boring spaces you
 

00:34:59.910 --> 00:35:02.600
like all the sort of boring spaces you
know the basic air the offices and the

00:35:02.600 --> 00:35:02.610
know the basic air the offices and the
 

00:35:02.610 --> 00:35:05.470
know the basic air the offices and the
different places that are supposed to

00:35:05.470 --> 00:35:05.480
different places that are supposed to
 

00:35:05.480 --> 00:35:09.500
different places that are supposed to
create the connections with the public

00:35:09.500 --> 00:35:09.510
create the connections with the public
 

00:35:09.510 --> 00:35:14.390
create the connections with the public
space on top this is the void across and

00:35:14.390 --> 00:35:14.400
space on top this is the void across and
 

00:35:14.400 --> 00:35:23.730
space on top this is the void across and
the final project

00:35:23.730 --> 00:35:23.740
 
 

00:35:23.740 --> 00:35:26.940
 
so that's a project that we said lost as

00:35:26.940 --> 00:35:26.950
so that's a project that we said lost as
 

00:35:26.950 --> 00:35:29.540
so that's a project that we said lost as
well I mean we get a mention ultimately

00:35:29.540 --> 00:35:29.550
well I mean we get a mention ultimately
 

00:35:29.550 --> 00:35:35.790
well I mean we get a mention ultimately
doesn't get us very far but but it

00:35:35.790 --> 00:35:35.800
doesn't get us very far but but it
 

00:35:35.800 --> 00:35:37.650
doesn't get us very far but but it
allowed us to to think about you know

00:35:37.650 --> 00:35:37.660
allowed us to to think about you know
 

00:35:37.660 --> 00:35:41.400
allowed us to to think about you know
this issue of sort of urbanity like

00:35:41.400 --> 00:35:41.410
this issue of sort of urbanity like
 

00:35:41.410 --> 00:35:44.930
this issue of sort of urbanity like
urban conditions and public space again

00:35:44.930 --> 00:35:44.940
urban conditions and public space again
 

00:35:44.940 --> 00:35:48.840
urban conditions and public space again
this is a project we did earlier and I'm

00:35:48.840 --> 00:35:48.850
this is a project we did earlier and I'm
 

00:35:48.850 --> 00:35:50.609
this is a project we did earlier and I'm
just showing it because of its insanity

00:35:50.609 --> 00:35:50.619
just showing it because of its insanity
 

00:35:50.619 --> 00:35:55.440
just showing it because of its insanity
in a way it's it's a private Danish

00:35:55.440 --> 00:35:55.450
in a way it's it's a private Danish
 

00:35:55.450 --> 00:35:57.750
in a way it's it's a private Danish
developer who came to us and asked us to

00:35:57.750 --> 00:35:57.760
developer who came to us and asked us to
 

00:35:57.760 --> 00:36:00.510
developer who came to us and asked us to
design six million square meters which

00:36:00.510 --> 00:36:00.520
design six million square meters which
 

00:36:00.520 --> 00:36:03.080
design six million square meters which
is kind of completely incomprehensible

00:36:03.080 --> 00:36:03.090
is kind of completely incomprehensible
 

00:36:03.090 --> 00:36:08.430
is kind of completely incomprehensible
set of our conditional scale and he also

00:36:08.430 --> 00:36:08.440
set of our conditional scale and he also
 

00:36:08.440 --> 00:36:11.810
set of our conditional scale and he also
said that it had to be a 666 meters high

00:36:11.810 --> 00:36:11.820
said that it had to be a 666 meters high
 

00:36:11.820 --> 00:36:15.090
said that it had to be a 666 meters high
which was also sort of weird and after a

00:36:15.090 --> 00:36:15.100
which was also sort of weird and after a
 

00:36:15.100 --> 00:36:18.060
which was also sort of weird and after a
while he came to and said they was 888

00:36:18.060 --> 00:36:18.070
while he came to and said they was 888
 

00:36:18.070 --> 00:36:20.670
while he came to and said they was 888
meters and apparently he had like a lot

00:36:20.670 --> 00:36:20.680
meters and apparently he had like a lot
 

00:36:20.680 --> 00:36:22.560
meters and apparently he had like a lot
of discussions you know in the

00:36:22.560 --> 00:36:22.570
of discussions you know in the
 

00:36:22.570 --> 00:36:25.380
of discussions you know in the
background because the any said like it

00:36:25.380 --> 00:36:25.390
background because the any said like it
 

00:36:25.390 --> 00:36:28.050
background because the any said like it
had to be like a hammer Casimir 111

00:36:28.050 --> 00:36:28.060
had to be like a hammer Casimir 111
 

00:36:28.060 --> 00:36:30.660
had to be like a hammer Casimir 111
meters out and and on top of all that

00:36:30.660 --> 00:36:30.670
meters out and and on top of all that
 

00:36:30.670 --> 00:36:33.420
meters out and and on top of all that
you had to be thankfully so you're

00:36:33.420 --> 00:36:33.430
you had to be thankfully so you're
 

00:36:33.430 --> 00:36:34.980
you had to be thankfully so you're
starting to get the sort of the idea of

00:36:34.980 --> 00:36:34.990
starting to get the sort of the idea of
 

00:36:34.990 --> 00:36:38.609
starting to get the sort of the idea of
the setting we machines n next to Hong

00:36:38.609 --> 00:36:38.619
the setting we machines n next to Hong
 

00:36:38.619 --> 00:36:41.700
the setting we machines n next to Hong
Kong and it was at this time when you

00:36:41.700 --> 00:36:41.710
Kong and it was at this time when you
 

00:36:41.710 --> 00:36:43.320
Kong and it was at this time when you
know shenzhen is sort of booming and

00:36:43.320 --> 00:36:43.330
know shenzhen is sort of booming and
 

00:36:43.330 --> 00:36:45.210
know shenzhen is sort of booming and
developing as a sort of an extension of

00:36:45.210 --> 00:36:45.220
developing as a sort of an extension of
 

00:36:45.220 --> 00:36:48.000
developing as a sort of an extension of
hong kong when we went to the side and

00:36:48.000 --> 00:36:48.010
hong kong when we went to the side and
 

00:36:48.010 --> 00:36:50.190
hong kong when we went to the side and
started analyzing it we realized that

00:36:50.190 --> 00:36:50.200
started analyzing it we realized that
 

00:36:50.200 --> 00:36:52.830
started analyzing it we realized that
the condition was actually across you

00:36:52.830 --> 00:36:52.840
the condition was actually across you
 

00:36:52.840 --> 00:36:55.200
the condition was actually across you
know the past 20-30 years I really

00:36:55.200 --> 00:36:55.210
know the past 20-30 years I really
 

00:36:55.210 --> 00:36:57.990
know the past 20-30 years I really
depressing there was like no more nature

00:36:57.990 --> 00:36:58.000
depressing there was like no more nature
 

00:36:58.000 --> 00:37:00.480
depressing there was like no more nature
happening in the in the region went from

00:37:00.480 --> 00:37:00.490
happening in the in the region went from
 

00:37:00.490 --> 00:37:03.570
happening in the in the region went from
this condition of urbanity to this one

00:37:03.570 --> 00:37:03.580
this condition of urbanity to this one
 

00:37:03.580 --> 00:37:06.599
this condition of urbanity to this one
in 20 years and this this was actually

00:37:06.599 --> 00:37:06.609
in 20 years and this this was actually
 

00:37:06.609 --> 00:37:09.300
in 20 years and this this was actually
happening against you know topography

00:37:09.300 --> 00:37:09.310
happening against you know topography
 

00:37:09.310 --> 00:37:11.220
happening against you know topography
and everything I mean like sort of a

00:37:11.220 --> 00:37:11.230
and everything I mean like sort of a
 

00:37:11.230 --> 00:37:14.520
and everything I mean like sort of a
flattening the land this is Hong Kong so

00:37:14.520 --> 00:37:14.530
flattening the land this is Hong Kong so
 

00:37:14.530 --> 00:37:16.290
flattening the land this is Hong Kong so
like as a condition it's very

00:37:16.290 --> 00:37:16.300
like as a condition it's very
 

00:37:16.300 --> 00:37:17.790
like as a condition it's very
interesting condition because you have

00:37:17.790 --> 00:37:17.800
interesting condition because you have
 

00:37:17.800 --> 00:37:20.099
interesting condition because you have
you know almost like a three-dimensional

00:37:20.099 --> 00:37:20.109
you know almost like a three-dimensional
 

00:37:20.109 --> 00:37:23.880
you know almost like a three-dimensional
urbanism with nature and this was a sort

00:37:23.880 --> 00:37:23.890
urbanism with nature and this was a sort
 

00:37:23.890 --> 00:37:28.230
urbanism with nature and this was a sort
of version of it in ash and then so what

00:37:28.230 --> 00:37:28.240
of version of it in ash and then so what
 

00:37:28.240 --> 00:37:30.210
of version of it in ash and then so what
we started as a kind of question was

00:37:30.210 --> 00:37:30.220
we started as a kind of question was
 

00:37:30.220 --> 00:37:31.640
we started as a kind of question was
could we do a project

00:37:31.640 --> 00:37:31.650
could we do a project
 

00:37:31.650 --> 00:37:33.500
could we do a project
you know a new hong kong also an

00:37:33.500 --> 00:37:33.510
you know a new hong kong also an
 

00:37:33.510 --> 00:37:36.280
you know a new hong kong also an
extension of hong kong this was our site

00:37:36.280 --> 00:37:36.290
extension of hong kong this was our site
 

00:37:36.290 --> 00:37:38.720
extension of hong kong this was our site
and when we started looking at i mean

00:37:38.720 --> 00:37:38.730
and when we started looking at i mean
 

00:37:38.730 --> 00:37:41.360
and when we started looking at i mean
after a lot of tryouts and a lot of

00:37:41.360 --> 00:37:41.370
after a lot of tryouts and a lot of
 

00:37:41.370 --> 00:37:43.610
after a lot of tryouts and a lot of
failures trying to do you know an

00:37:43.610 --> 00:37:43.620
failures trying to do you know an
 

00:37:43.620 --> 00:37:45.980
failures trying to do you know an
interesting tower of a thousand 111

00:37:45.980 --> 00:37:45.990
interesting tower of a thousand 111
 

00:37:45.990 --> 00:37:48.530
interesting tower of a thousand 111
meters well and like not really getting

00:37:48.530 --> 00:37:48.540
meters well and like not really getting
 

00:37:48.540 --> 00:37:51.110
meters well and like not really getting
anywhere we just realized that we were

00:37:51.110 --> 00:37:51.120
anywhere we just realized that we were
 

00:37:51.120 --> 00:37:53.330
anywhere we just realized that we were
asking us at the wrong question is that

00:37:53.330 --> 00:37:53.340
asking us at the wrong question is that
 

00:37:53.340 --> 00:37:55.040
asking us at the wrong question is that
it wasn't about doing a tower it was

00:37:55.040 --> 00:37:55.050
it wasn't about doing a tower it was
 

00:37:55.050 --> 00:37:57.530
it wasn't about doing a tower it was
actually doing a city that was a real

00:37:57.530 --> 00:37:57.540
actually doing a city that was a real
 

00:37:57.540 --> 00:38:00.320
actually doing a city that was a real
question so we started looking at this

00:38:00.320 --> 00:38:00.330
question so we started looking at this
 

00:38:00.330 --> 00:38:03.080
question so we started looking at this
this condition of overlaying

00:38:03.080 --> 00:38:03.090
this condition of overlaying
 

00:38:03.090 --> 00:38:05.420
this condition of overlaying
neighborhoods on to each other and sort

00:38:05.420 --> 00:38:05.430
neighborhoods on to each other and sort
 

00:38:05.430 --> 00:38:07.670
neighborhoods on to each other and sort
of understanding you know what sort of

00:38:07.670 --> 00:38:07.680
of understanding you know what sort of
 

00:38:07.680 --> 00:38:10.570
of understanding you know what sort of
components of the neighborhood we could

00:38:10.570 --> 00:38:10.580
components of the neighborhood we could
 

00:38:10.580 --> 00:38:13.790
components of the neighborhood we could
provide in order to to create that sort

00:38:13.790 --> 00:38:13.800
provide in order to to create that sort
 

00:38:13.800 --> 00:38:16.220
provide in order to to create that sort
of vertical urbanism and so we came up

00:38:16.220 --> 00:38:16.230
of vertical urbanism and so we came up
 

00:38:16.230 --> 00:38:19.610
of vertical urbanism and so we came up
with this very simple paper mall that

00:38:19.610 --> 00:38:19.620
with this very simple paper mall that
 

00:38:19.620 --> 00:38:21.860
with this very simple paper mall that
was actually the sort of start up for

00:38:21.860 --> 00:38:21.870
was actually the sort of start up for
 

00:38:21.870 --> 00:38:24.770
was actually the sort of start up for
the whole project if you look at the

00:38:24.770 --> 00:38:24.780
the whole project if you look at the
 

00:38:24.780 --> 00:38:28.130
the whole project if you look at the
project in a sort of like in plan and

00:38:28.130 --> 00:38:28.140
project in a sort of like in plan and
 

00:38:28.140 --> 00:38:29.900
project in a sort of like in plan and
without the program will just look at

00:38:29.900 --> 00:38:29.910
without the program will just look at
 

00:38:29.910 --> 00:38:32.210
without the program will just look at
the void the main void is quite funny

00:38:32.210 --> 00:38:32.220
the void the main void is quite funny
 

00:38:32.220 --> 00:38:33.980
the void the main void is quite funny
that it actually looks like miss van del

00:38:33.980 --> 00:38:33.990
that it actually looks like miss van del
 

00:38:33.990 --> 00:38:36.650
that it actually looks like miss van del
Carmen but in fact the project is this

00:38:36.650 --> 00:38:36.660
Carmen but in fact the project is this
 

00:38:36.660 --> 00:38:40.280
Carmen but in fact the project is this
kind of wrong set of programs where you

00:38:40.280 --> 00:38:40.290
kind of wrong set of programs where you
 

00:38:40.290 --> 00:38:42.110
kind of wrong set of programs where you
have on the inside all the commercial

00:38:42.110 --> 00:38:42.120
have on the inside all the commercial
 

00:38:42.120 --> 00:38:44.360
have on the inside all the commercial
and all the office spaces on the outside

00:38:44.360 --> 00:38:44.370
and all the office spaces on the outside
 

00:38:44.370 --> 00:38:48.440
and all the office spaces on the outside
all the residential spaces and then

00:38:48.440 --> 00:38:48.450
all the residential spaces and then
 

00:38:48.450 --> 00:38:50.180
all the residential spaces and then
parks sort of tying these two together

00:38:50.180 --> 00:38:50.190
parks sort of tying these two together
 

00:38:50.190 --> 00:38:52.280
parks sort of tying these two together
so if you look at in section when it

00:38:52.280 --> 00:38:52.290
so if you look at in section when it
 

00:38:52.290 --> 00:38:55.220
so if you look at in section when it
gets deeper and darker is public

00:38:55.220 --> 00:38:55.230
gets deeper and darker is public
 

00:38:55.230 --> 00:38:57.980
gets deeper and darker is public
programs such as no cinemas and sports

00:38:57.980 --> 00:38:57.990
programs such as no cinemas and sports
 

00:38:57.990 --> 00:39:00.710
programs such as no cinemas and sports
fields and then when you zoom in you

00:39:00.710 --> 00:39:00.720
fields and then when you zoom in you
 

00:39:00.720 --> 00:39:02.600
fields and then when you zoom in you
have you know terrazas towards the

00:39:02.600 --> 00:39:02.610
have you know terrazas towards the
 

00:39:02.610 --> 00:39:06.560
have you know terrazas towards the
inside and then commercial spaces on the

00:39:06.560 --> 00:39:06.570
inside and then commercial spaces on the
 

00:39:06.570 --> 00:39:10.280
inside and then commercial spaces on the
outside and of course this was you know

00:39:10.280 --> 00:39:10.290
outside and of course this was you know
 

00:39:10.290 --> 00:39:14.090
outside and of course this was you know
a study would say it's a it was

00:39:14.090 --> 00:39:14.100
a study would say it's a it was
 

00:39:14.100 --> 00:39:16.370
a study would say it's a it was
developed to a certain level but not not

00:39:16.370 --> 00:39:16.380
developed to a certain level but not not
 

00:39:16.380 --> 00:39:19.460
developed to a certain level but not not
fully and it was also kind of stopped at

00:39:19.460 --> 00:39:19.470
fully and it was also kind of stopped at
 

00:39:19.470 --> 00:39:21.390
fully and it was also kind of stopped at
the moment of her

00:39:21.390 --> 00:39:21.400
the moment of her
 

00:39:21.400 --> 00:39:24.210
the moment of her
no crisis when developers started

00:39:24.210 --> 00:39:24.220
no crisis when developers started
 

00:39:24.220 --> 00:39:25.770
no crisis when developers started
running away from these kind of

00:39:25.770 --> 00:39:25.780
running away from these kind of
 

00:39:25.780 --> 00:39:30.900
running away from these kind of
development but it was interesting as a

00:39:30.900 --> 00:39:30.910
development but it was interesting as a
 

00:39:30.910 --> 00:39:35.100
development but it was interesting as a
sort of way of thinking in her even like

00:39:35.100 --> 00:39:35.110
sort of way of thinking in her even like
 

00:39:35.110 --> 00:39:36.960
sort of way of thinking in her even like
contextual issues I mean you know that

00:39:36.960 --> 00:39:36.970
contextual issues I mean you know that
 

00:39:36.970 --> 00:39:39.480
contextual issues I mean you know that
in the inner in this sort of the

00:39:39.480 --> 00:39:39.490
in the inner in this sort of the
 

00:39:39.490 --> 00:39:40.710
in the inner in this sort of the
neighborhood of Shenzhen you know

00:39:40.710 --> 00:39:40.720
neighborhood of Shenzhen you know
 

00:39:40.720 --> 00:39:42.930
neighborhood of Shenzhen you know
everything will go in like no time so

00:39:42.930 --> 00:39:42.940
everything will go in like no time so
 

00:39:42.940 --> 00:39:46.950
everything will go in like no time so
it's it's also like a way to to deal

going but I like her in also it's a
 

00:43:59.249 --> 00:44:00.949
going but I like her in also it's a
little more dangerous because you know

00:44:00.949 --> 00:44:00.959
little more dangerous because you know
 

00:44:00.959 --> 00:44:03.890
little more dangerous because you know
they do jump and sometimes when burst

00:44:03.890 --> 00:44:03.900
they do jump and sometimes when burst
 

00:44:03.900 --> 00:44:06.829
they do jump and sometimes when burst
mode and then accidents it could happen

00:44:06.829 --> 00:44:06.839
mode and then accidents it could happen
 

00:44:06.839 --> 00:44:10.789
mode and then accidents it could happen
so another thing was that then they

00:44:10.789 --> 00:44:10.799
so another thing was that then they
 

00:44:10.799 --> 00:44:13.009
so another thing was that then they
decided not to build this keygen even

00:44:13.009 --> 00:44:13.019
decided not to build this keygen even
 

00:44:13.019 --> 00:44:15.620
decided not to build this keygen even
though it had been sort of decided and

00:44:15.620 --> 00:44:15.630
though it had been sort of decided and
 

00:44:15.630 --> 00:44:19.249
though it had been sort of decided and
you know the competition was won and I

00:44:19.249 --> 00:44:19.259
you know the competition was won and I
 

00:44:19.259 --> 00:44:20.779
you know the competition was won and I
think that's that comes out of this kind

00:44:20.779 --> 00:44:20.789
think that's that comes out of this kind
 

00:44:20.789 --> 00:44:24.439
think that's that comes out of this kind
of political sort of attitude to be

00:44:24.439 --> 00:44:24.449
of political sort of attitude to be
 

00:44:24.449 --> 00:44:27.769
of political sort of attitude to be
scared of too much public opinions then

00:44:27.769 --> 00:44:27.779
scared of too much public opinions then
 

00:44:27.779 --> 00:44:29.419
scared of too much public opinions then
at some point some guy came up and said

00:44:29.419 --> 00:44:29.429
at some point some guy came up and said
 

00:44:29.429 --> 00:44:33.309
at some point some guy came up and said
that warned the International architects

00:44:33.309 --> 00:44:33.319
that warned the International architects
 

00:44:33.319 --> 00:44:37.309
that warned the International architects
community not to submit projects in in

00:44:37.309 --> 00:44:37.319
community not to submit projects in in
 

00:44:37.319 --> 00:44:39.549
community not to submit projects in in
Norway and in also in particular because

00:44:39.549 --> 00:44:39.559
Norway and in also in particular because
 

00:44:39.559 --> 00:44:42.049
Norway and in also in particular because
you know they would not be realized and

00:44:42.049 --> 00:44:42.059
you know they would not be realized and
 

00:44:42.059 --> 00:44:43.759
you know they would not be realized and
it's true that or slow has a pretty long

00:44:43.759 --> 00:44:43.769
it's true that or slow has a pretty long
 

00:44:43.769 --> 00:44:47.209
it's true that or slow has a pretty long
string of international competition not

00:44:47.209 --> 00:44:47.219
string of international competition not
 

00:44:47.219 --> 00:44:47.710
string of international competition not
being

00:44:47.710 --> 00:44:47.720

00:44:47.720 --> 00:44:50.560
being
alized some of which or may has

00:44:50.560 --> 00:44:50.570
alized some of which or may has
 

00:44:50.570 --> 00:44:57.010
alized some of which or may has
participated and so then after all in

00:44:57.010 --> 00:44:57.020
participated and so then after all in
 

00:44:57.020 --> 00:44:59.170
participated and so then after all in
December they actually decided to

00:44:59.170 --> 00:44:59.180
December they actually decided to
 

00:44:59.180 --> 00:45:03.070
December they actually decided to
rehabilitate the ski jump so meaning

00:45:03.070 --> 00:45:03.080
rehabilitate the ski jump so meaning
 

00:45:03.080 --> 00:45:04.660
rehabilitate the ski jump so meaning
like they would do it but they didn't

00:45:04.660 --> 00:45:04.670
like they would do it but they didn't
 

00:45:04.670 --> 00:45:07.390
like they would do it but they didn't
really really say how what it turned out

00:45:07.390 --> 00:45:07.400
really really say how what it turned out
 

00:45:07.400 --> 00:45:09.250
really really say how what it turned out
to be is that they wanted to make a

00:45:09.250 --> 00:45:09.260
to be is that they wanted to make a
 

00:45:09.260 --> 00:45:11.109
to be is that they wanted to make a
renovation of the ski jump and then we

00:45:11.109 --> 00:45:11.119
renovation of the ski jump and then we
 

00:45:11.119 --> 00:45:14.080
renovation of the ski jump and then we
had to which I'll explain to study what

00:45:14.080 --> 00:45:14.090
had to which I'll explain to study what
 

00:45:14.090 --> 00:45:16.240
had to which I'll explain to study what
that meant then the person that was

00:45:16.240 --> 00:45:16.250
that meant then the person that was
 

00:45:16.250 --> 00:45:18.460
that meant then the person that was
responsible for that get kicked out

00:45:18.460 --> 00:45:18.470
responsible for that get kicked out
 

00:45:18.470 --> 00:45:21.880
responsible for that get kicked out
because she cannot hit she was hiding

00:45:21.880 --> 00:45:21.890
because she cannot hit she was hiding
 

00:45:21.890 --> 00:45:25.180
because she cannot hit she was hiding
some budget problems that were occurring

00:45:25.180 --> 00:45:25.190
some budget problems that were occurring
 

00:45:25.190 --> 00:45:28.839
some budget problems that were occurring
with the with the competition and the

00:45:28.839 --> 00:45:28.849
with the with the competition and the
 

00:45:28.849 --> 00:45:31.480
with the with the competition and the
reality of the budget this project

00:45:31.480 --> 00:45:31.490
reality of the budget this project
 

00:45:31.490 --> 00:45:34.089
reality of the budget this project
started in 2005 with as a kind of

00:45:34.089 --> 00:45:34.099
started in 2005 with as a kind of
 

00:45:34.099 --> 00:45:36.720
started in 2005 with as a kind of
political decision to be a 15 million

00:45:36.720 --> 00:45:36.730
political decision to be a 15 million
 

00:45:36.730 --> 00:45:40.900
political decision to be a 15 million
Norwegian corner project when in 2007 we

00:45:40.900 --> 00:45:40.910
Norwegian corner project when in 2007 we
 

00:45:40.910 --> 00:45:43.030
Norwegian corner project when in 2007 we
took out the competition it was a 500

00:45:43.030 --> 00:45:43.040
took out the competition it was a 500
 

00:45:43.040 --> 00:45:46.089
took out the competition it was a 500
million corner budget and we ended up

00:45:46.089 --> 00:45:46.099
million corner budget and we ended up
 

00:45:46.099 --> 00:45:48.250
million corner budget and we ended up
building it for 800 million so you could

00:45:48.250 --> 00:45:48.260
building it for 800 million so you could
 

00:45:48.260 --> 00:45:49.510
building it for 800 million so you could
see that there's like a pretty little

00:45:49.510 --> 00:45:49.520
see that there's like a pretty little
 

00:45:49.520 --> 00:45:54.370
see that there's like a pretty little
sort of extensive gap of knowledge in

00:45:54.370 --> 00:45:54.380
sort of extensive gap of knowledge in
 

00:45:54.380 --> 00:45:57.640
sort of extensive gap of knowledge in
terms of like budget calculation and she

00:45:57.640 --> 00:45:57.650
terms of like budget calculation and she
 

00:45:57.650 --> 00:46:01.180
terms of like budget calculation and she
is partially responsible of that so in

00:46:01.180 --> 00:46:01.190
is partially responsible of that so in
 

00:46:01.190 --> 00:46:03.130
is partially responsible of that so in
this mess we started the petition

00:46:03.130 --> 00:46:03.140
this mess we started the petition
 

00:46:03.140 --> 00:46:05.079
this mess we started the petition
because we could see that things were

00:46:05.079 --> 00:46:05.089
because we could see that things were
 

00:46:05.089 --> 00:46:07.329
because we could see that things were
like so sketchy that we had to intervene

00:46:07.329 --> 00:46:07.339
like so sketchy that we had to intervene
 

00:46:07.339 --> 00:46:10.000
like so sketchy that we had to intervene
so we actually made a competition on the

online but you could support you know
 

00:46:12.680 --> 00:46:17.040
online but you could support you know
our project and it recorded like a 2,000

among the municipality then came up this
 

00:46:26.330 --> 00:46:29.890
among the municipality then came up this
issue that you know that we were not

Belgium has known so the question was
 

00:47:07.400 --> 00:47:10.000
Belgium has known so the question was
like this sort of you know looking at

00:47:10.000 --> 00:47:10.010
like this sort of you know looking at
 

00:47:10.010 --> 00:47:12.820
like this sort of you know looking at
the AHA's achievements and instead of

and this kind of wondering you know what
 

00:47:20.330 --> 00:47:23.620
and this kind of wondering you know what
has actually a sort of a lot of that

00:47:23.620 --> 00:47:23.630
has actually a sort of a lot of that
 

00:47:23.630 --> 00:47:28.960
has actually a sort of a lot of that
condition it just completely like taking

00:47:28.960 --> 00:47:28.970
condition it just completely like taking
 

00:47:28.970 --> 00:47:32.020
condition it just completely like taking
it as a joke but like also like sort of

00:47:32.020 --> 00:47:32.030
it as a joke but like also like sort of
 

00:47:32.030 --> 00:47:34.150
it as a joke but like also like sort of
as a way to sort of get back to the

00:47:34.150 --> 00:47:34.160
as a way to sort of get back to the
 

00:47:34.160 --> 00:47:37.330
as a way to sort of get back to the
issue of you know the criticism that we

00:47:37.330 --> 00:47:37.340
issue of you know the criticism that we
 

00:47:37.340 --> 00:47:40.090
issue of you know the criticism that we
were we were under this attack of you

00:47:40.090 --> 00:47:40.100
were we were under this attack of you
 

00:47:40.100 --> 00:47:41.980
were we were under this attack of you
know whether we would be able to do it

00:47:41.980 --> 00:47:41.990
know whether we would be able to do it
 

00:47:41.990 --> 00:47:44.050
know whether we would be able to do it
or not so the first thing was you know

00:47:44.050 --> 00:47:44.060
or not so the first thing was you know
 

00:47:44.060 --> 00:47:45.700
or not so the first thing was you know
being a region and whatever that meant

you know wearing some crazy hats but
 

00:47:49.850 --> 00:47:53.020
you know wearing some crazy hats but
basically meant like being like having a

00:47:53.020 --> 00:47:53.030
basically meant like being like having a
 

00:47:53.030 --> 00:47:54.910
basically meant like being like having a
local office which is what we did so we

00:47:54.910 --> 00:47:54.920
local office which is what we did so we
 

00:47:54.920 --> 00:47:57.790
local office which is what we did so we
open up an office in nostril and then

00:47:57.790 --> 00:47:57.800
open up an office in nostril and then
 

00:47:57.800 --> 00:48:00.730
open up an office in nostril and then
sort of discussing this issue of the

00:48:00.730 --> 00:48:00.740
sort of discussing this issue of the
 

00:48:00.740 --> 00:48:04.480
sort of discussing this issue of the
icon of the country of a nation and sort

00:48:04.480 --> 00:48:04.490
icon of the country of a nation and sort
 

00:48:04.490 --> 00:48:07.690
icon of the country of a nation and sort
of looking at what that could mean in

00:48:07.690 --> 00:48:07.700
of looking at what that could mean in
 

00:48:07.700 --> 00:48:10.480
of looking at what that could mean in
terms of in terms of a project and in

00:48:10.480 --> 00:48:10.490
terms of in terms of a project and in
 

00:48:10.490 --> 00:48:12.820
terms of in terms of a project and in
fact at that point trying to re-explain

00:48:12.820 --> 00:48:12.830
fact at that point trying to re-explain
 

00:48:12.830 --> 00:48:15.520
fact at that point trying to re-explain
you know what our project was about so

00:48:15.520 --> 00:48:15.530
you know what our project was about so
 

00:48:15.530 --> 00:48:18.280
you know what our project was about so
we just sort of went in and explain you

00:48:18.280 --> 00:48:18.290
we just sort of went in and explain you
 

00:48:18.290 --> 00:48:20.349
we just sort of went in and explain you
know the basic cell project over and

00:48:20.349 --> 00:48:20.359
know the basic cell project over and
 

00:48:20.359 --> 00:48:22.420
know the basic cell project over and
over in order to kind of gain back this

00:48:22.420 --> 00:48:22.430
over in order to kind of gain back this
 

00:48:22.430 --> 00:48:26.680
over in order to kind of gain back this
sort of agreement that we already get

00:48:26.680 --> 00:48:26.690
sort of agreement that we already get
 

00:48:26.690 --> 00:48:29.050
sort of agreement that we already get
officially from the competition but in

00:48:29.050 --> 00:48:29.060
officially from the competition but in
 

00:48:29.060 --> 00:48:31.540
officially from the competition but in
this case from the citizens and the

00:48:31.540 --> 00:48:31.550
this case from the citizens and the
 

00:48:31.550 --> 00:48:33.190
this case from the citizens and the
basic idea was to say okay there's an

00:48:33.190 --> 00:48:33.200
basic idea was to say okay there's an
 

00:48:33.200 --> 00:48:34.570
basic idea was to say okay there's an
ideal slope and this is something that

00:48:34.570 --> 00:48:34.580
ideal slope and this is something that
 

00:48:34.580 --> 00:48:38.140
ideal slope and this is something that
we have as a given and there's issues of

00:48:38.140 --> 00:48:38.150
we have as a given and there's issues of
 

00:48:38.150 --> 00:48:39.940
we have as a given and there's issues of
wind protection so we making you know

00:48:39.940 --> 00:48:39.950
wind protection so we making you know
 

00:48:39.950 --> 00:48:42.550
wind protection so we making you know
the wind protection condition then we

00:48:42.550 --> 00:48:42.560
the wind protection condition then we
 

00:48:42.560 --> 00:48:45.400
the wind protection condition then we
sort of extending that and by offsetting

00:48:45.400 --> 00:48:45.410
sort of extending that and by offsetting
 

00:48:45.410 --> 00:48:47.740
sort of extending that and by offsetting
that considering you know maybe a

00:48:47.740 --> 00:48:47.750
that considering you know maybe a
 

00:48:47.750 --> 00:48:50.890
that considering you know maybe a
simplification of the shape by doing so

00:48:50.890 --> 00:48:50.900
simplification of the shape by doing so
 

00:48:50.900 --> 00:48:52.620
simplification of the shape by doing so
we also decide to move

00:48:52.620 --> 00:48:52.630
we also decide to move
 

00:48:52.630 --> 00:48:55.980
we also decide to move
all the all the land program the program

that's supposed to support the project

00:48:58.650 --> 00:48:58.660
that's supposed to support the project
 

00:48:58.660 --> 00:49:01.350
that's supposed to support the project
into the hill so that it becomes a sort

00:49:01.350 --> 00:49:01.360
into the hill so that it becomes a sort
 

00:49:01.360 --> 00:49:04.680
into the hill so that it becomes a sort
of a slightly more simple shape that

00:49:04.680 --> 00:49:04.690
of a slightly more simple shape that

00:49:07.440 --> 00:49:07.450
then is being reconnected by an elevator
 

00:49:07.450 --> 00:49:10.170
then is being reconnected by an elevator
so that all programs are along one

00:49:10.170 --> 00:49:10.180
so that all programs are along one

project that is an icon only it's
 

00:49:18.850 --> 00:49:20.700
project that is an icon only it's
actually a project that allows for

actually a project that allows for
 

00:49:20.710 --> 00:49:23.250
actually a project that allows for
rethinking you know the ID of the icon

imagine you know experiencing that place

00:49:37.820 --> 00:49:37.830
imagine you know experiencing that place
 

00:49:37.830 --> 00:49:40.680

competition then later on we worked on

00:49:53.550 --> 00:49:53.560
competition then later on we worked on
 

00:49:53.560 --> 00:49:56.460

the project developing you know the

00:49:56.460 --> 00:49:56.470
the project developing you know the
 

00:49:56.470 --> 00:49:59.760
the project developing you know the
different sort of like little aspects of

00:49:59.760 --> 00:49:59.770
different sort of like little aspects of
 

00:49:59.770 --> 00:50:02.790
different sort of like little aspects of
that and I go through some of them this

00:50:02.790 --> 00:50:02.800
that and I go through some of them this
 

00:50:02.800 --> 00:50:04.770
that and I go through some of them this
is the project that we ended up getting

00:50:04.770 --> 00:50:04.780
is the project that we ended up getting
 

00:50:04.780 --> 00:50:08.340
is the project that we ended up getting
an agreement on you see it's pretty

00:50:08.340 --> 00:50:08.350
an agreement on you see it's pretty
 

00:50:08.350 --> 00:50:10.350
an agreement on you see it's pretty
faithful to the original project but I

00:50:10.350 --> 00:50:10.360
faithful to the original project but I
 

00:50:10.360 --> 00:50:14.450
faithful to the original project but I
go to some aspects of deaths that are

00:50:14.450 --> 00:50:14.460
go to some aspects of deaths that are
 

00:50:14.460 --> 00:50:18.350
go to some aspects of deaths that are
sometimes great sometimes really painful

00:50:18.350 --> 00:50:18.360
sometimes great sometimes really painful
 

00:50:18.360 --> 00:50:22.560
sometimes great sometimes really painful
we were first required to study a

00:50:22.560 --> 00:50:22.570
we were first required to study a
 

00:50:22.570 --> 00:50:25.320
we were first required to study a
rehabilitation which meant that we add

00:50:25.320 --> 00:50:25.330
rehabilitation which meant that we add
 

00:50:25.330 --> 00:50:27.570
rehabilitation which meant that we add
actually to renovate potentially the

00:50:27.570 --> 00:50:27.580
actually to renovate potentially the
 

00:50:27.580 --> 00:50:30.300
actually to renovate potentially the
structure so instead of doing a whole

00:50:30.300 --> 00:50:30.310
structure so instead of doing a whole
 

00:50:30.310 --> 00:50:32.400
structure so instead of doing a whole
new gem we also were asked to study this

00:50:32.400 --> 00:50:32.410
new gem we also were asked to study this
 

00:50:32.410 --> 00:50:35.250
new gem we also were asked to study this
and and by study I mean like go all the

00:50:35.250 --> 00:50:35.260
and and by study I mean like go all the
 

00:50:35.260 --> 00:50:38.330
and and by study I mean like go all the
way through and this is like basically

00:50:38.330 --> 00:50:38.340
way through and this is like basically
 

00:50:38.340 --> 00:50:41.070
way through and this is like basically
wrapping the existing ski gym with a

00:50:41.070 --> 00:50:41.080
wrapping the existing ski gym with a
 

00:50:41.080 --> 00:50:43.410
wrapping the existing ski gym with a
steel structure just in order to extend

00:50:43.410 --> 00:50:43.420
steel structure just in order to extend
 

00:50:43.420 --> 00:50:46.020
steel structure just in order to extend
it for a few meters which was totally

00:50:46.020 --> 00:50:46.030
it for a few meters which was totally
 

00:50:46.030 --> 00:50:49.020
it for a few meters which was totally
absurd and this was the other study that

00:50:49.020 --> 00:50:49.030
absurd and this was the other study that
 

00:50:49.030 --> 00:50:50.850
absurd and this was the other study that
we had to make which is our

00:50:50.850 --> 00:50:50.860
we had to make which is our
 

00:50:50.860 --> 00:50:56.070
we had to make which is our
from the competition finally in April we

00:50:56.070 --> 00:50:56.080
from the competition finally in April we
 

00:50:56.080 --> 00:50:59.280
from the competition finally in April we
are given you know the news that we

00:50:59.280 --> 00:50:59.290
are given you know the news that we
 

00:50:59.290 --> 00:51:01.050
are given you know the news that we
going to be hired for the job that we

00:51:01.050 --> 00:51:01.060
going to be hired for the job that we
 

00:51:01.060 --> 00:51:05.970
going to be hired for the job that we
already won you know months before but

00:51:05.970 --> 00:51:05.980
already won you know months before but
 

00:51:05.980 --> 00:51:07.440
already won you know months before but
then they still don't know what to do

00:51:07.440 --> 00:51:07.450
then they still don't know what to do
 

00:51:07.450 --> 00:51:09.510
then they still don't know what to do
and they don't know what level of ASCII

00:51:09.510 --> 00:51:09.520
and they don't know what level of ASCII
 

00:51:09.520 --> 00:51:10.770
and they don't know what level of ASCII
gem they're going to be doing because

00:51:10.770 --> 00:51:10.780
gem they're going to be doing because
 

00:51:10.780 --> 00:51:13.490
gem they're going to be doing because
there's all these different sort of

00:51:13.490 --> 00:51:13.500
there's all these different sort of
 

00:51:13.500 --> 00:51:16.620
there's all these different sort of
steps in ski jumping you know from the

00:51:16.620 --> 00:51:16.630
steps in ski jumping you know from the
 

00:51:16.630 --> 00:51:20.220
steps in ski jumping you know from the
k18 the k15 115 was like the existing

00:51:20.220 --> 00:51:20.230
k18 the k15 115 was like the existing
 

00:51:20.230 --> 00:51:22.410
k18 the k15 115 was like the existing
one so we still don't know in the end

00:51:22.410 --> 00:51:22.420
one so we still don't know in the end
 

00:51:22.420 --> 00:51:24.780
one so we still don't know in the end
they kind of settle for like a hundred

00:51:24.780 --> 00:51:24.790
they kind of settle for like a hundred
 

00:51:24.790 --> 00:51:26.850
they kind of settle for like a hundred
and twenty and then we start studying it

00:51:26.850 --> 00:51:26.860
and twenty and then we start studying it
 

00:51:26.860 --> 00:51:30.240
and twenty and then we start studying it
there's a lot of like sort of very

00:51:30.240 --> 00:51:30.250
there's a lot of like sort of very
 

00:51:30.250 --> 00:51:32.010
there's a lot of like sort of very

going to go through but in the end we

00:51:33.570 --> 00:51:33.580
going to go through but in the end we
 

00:51:33.580 --> 00:51:36.450
going to go through but in the end we
end up agreeing on this setup in this

00:51:36.450 --> 00:51:36.460
end up agreeing on this setup in this
 

00:51:36.460 --> 00:51:38.820
end up agreeing on this setup in this
way of explaining the project and

00:51:38.820 --> 00:51:38.830
way of explaining the project and
 

00:51:38.830 --> 00:51:42.570
way of explaining the project and
different sub condition different sub

projects that we had to deal with with
 

00:51:45.010 --> 00:51:48.990
projects that we had to deal with with
different levels of importance so you

00:51:48.990 --> 00:51:49.000
different levels of importance so you
 

00:51:49.000 --> 00:51:51.030
different levels of importance so you
have of course the interim like the

00:51:51.030 --> 00:51:51.040
have of course the interim like the
 

00:51:51.040 --> 00:51:54.360
have of course the interim like the
actual jump and the landing it's a very

actual jump and the landing it's a very
 

00:51:54.370 --> 00:51:56.280
actual jump and the landing it's a very
important aspect of the project because

00:51:56.280 --> 00:51:56.290
important aspect of the project because
 

00:51:56.290 --> 00:51:59.070
important aspect of the project because
the lending is in fact really expensive

00:51:59.070 --> 00:51:59.080
the lending is in fact really expensive
 

00:51:59.080 --> 00:52:01.410
the lending is in fact really expensive

changing now the structure of the jump

00:53:26.250 --> 00:53:26.260
changing now the structure of the jump
 

00:53:26.260 --> 00:53:28.290
changing now the structure of the jump
is of course the main thing and the way

00:53:28.290 --> 00:53:28.300
is of course the main thing and the way

is of course the main thing and the way
it's built is it's a steel structure

00:53:30.060 --> 00:53:30.070
it's built is it's a steel structure
 

00:53:30.070 --> 00:53:31.980
it's built is it's a steel structure
it's in fact I wouldn't say that

00:53:31.980 --> 00:53:31.990
it's in fact I wouldn't say that
 

00:53:31.990 --> 00:53:34.140

one thing I was though quite a battle to

00:54:09.480 --> 00:54:09.490
one thing I was though quite a battle to
 

00:54:09.490 --> 00:54:11.280
one thing I was though quite a battle to
get through is the fact that we had to

00:54:11.280 --> 00:54:11.290
get through is the fact that we had to
 

00:54:11.290 --> 00:54:13.320
get through is the fact that we had to
study you know the deformations in the

study you know the deformations in the
 

00:54:13.330 --> 00:54:16.890
study you know the deformations in the
wind of the John not so much because we

00:54:16.890 --> 00:54:16.900
wind of the John not so much because we
 

00:54:16.900 --> 00:54:18.510
wind of the John not so much because we
were fearing that it was going to break

00:54:18.510 --> 00:54:18.520
were fearing that it was going to break
 

00:54:18.520 --> 00:54:20.880
were fearing that it was going to break
but in fact because it's it's a matter

00:54:20.880 --> 00:54:20.890
but in fact because it's it's a matter
 

00:54:20.890 --> 00:54:23.339

use of the the hill as a job so so we

00:54:27.720 --> 00:54:27.730
use of the the hill as a job so so we
 

00:54:27.730 --> 00:54:29.760
use of the the hill as a job so so we
consider at some point making putting

00:54:29.760 --> 00:54:29.770
consider at some point making putting
 

00:54:29.770 --> 00:54:33.270

any huge weight on the top in order to
 

00:54:33.280 --> 00:54:35.430
any huge weight on the top in order to
kind of stabilize the thing and we have

00:54:35.430 --> 00:54:35.440
kind of stabilize the thing and we have
 

00:54:35.440 --> 00:54:37.710
kind of stabilize the thing and we have
the possibility to still do so if it's

00:54:37.710 --> 00:54:37.720
the possibility to still do so if it's
 

00:54:37.720 --> 00:54:39.000
the possibility to still do so if it's
necessary but we need to kind of

00:54:39.000 --> 00:54:39.010
necessary but we need to kind of
 

00:54:39.010 --> 00:54:42.200
necessary but we need to kind of
experiment the jump a little bit before

00:54:42.200 --> 00:54:42.210
experiment the jump a little bit before

experiment the jump a little bit before
so this is in tune with the facade the

00:54:47.099 --> 00:54:47.109
so this is in tune with the facade the

act as a buffer towards the winds
 

00:54:53.619 --> 00:54:56.089
act as a buffer towards the winds
because of course it takes a lot of wins

00:54:56.089 --> 00:54:56.099
because of course it takes a lot of wins
 

00:54:56.099 --> 00:54:58.259
because of course it takes a lot of wins
so the point is that it has to be

00:54:58.259 --> 00:54:58.269
so the point is that it has to be
 

00:54:58.269 --> 00:55:01.529
so the point is that it has to be
perforated and up to a fifty percent

00:55:01.529 --> 00:55:01.539
perforated and up to a fifty percent

through a series of different options
 

00:55:09.159 --> 00:55:10.979
through a series of different options
like for instance this this is what we

00:55:10.979 --> 00:55:10.989
like for instance this this is what we
 

00:55:10.989 --> 00:55:13.949

did at the mountain again a perforated

00:55:13.949 --> 00:55:13.959
did at the mountain again a perforated
 

00:55:13.959 --> 00:55:16.439
did at the mountain again a perforated
steel plate of this one which was really

00:55:16.439 --> 00:55:16.449
steel plate of this one which was really
 

00:55:16.449 --> 00:55:20.069
steel plate of this one which was really
exciting as a chi chainmail but also

00:55:20.069 --> 00:55:20.079

just stretch it from one side all the
 

00:56:28.630 --> 00:56:30.959
just stretch it from one side all the
way through down and then hook it back

00:56:30.959 --> 00:56:30.969
way through down and then hook it back
 

00:56:30.969 --> 00:56:33.870
way through down and then hook it back
up one piece and that became interesting

00:56:33.870 --> 00:56:33.880
up one piece and that became interesting
 

00:56:33.880 --> 00:56:36.299
up one piece and that became interesting
in the idea of actually creating this

00:56:36.299 --> 00:56:36.309
in the idea of actually creating this
 

00:56:36.309 --> 00:56:39.689
in the idea of actually creating this
sort of a feeling of you know this kind

00:56:39.689 --> 00:56:39.699
sort of a feeling of you know this kind
 

00:56:39.699 --> 00:56:42.839
sort of a feeling of you know this kind
of stretch a piece that you bend so that

00:56:42.839 --> 00:56:42.849
of stretch a piece that you bend so that
 

00:56:42.849 --> 00:56:44.969
of stretch a piece that you bend so that
if you cannot zoom on it it's actually

00:56:44.969 --> 00:56:44.979
if you cannot zoom on it it's actually
 

00:56:44.979 --> 00:56:48.039
if you cannot zoom on it it's actually
like literally being bent

00:56:48.039 --> 00:56:48.049
like literally being bent
 

00:56:48.049 --> 00:56:57.279
like literally being bent
a sort of almost as a as a fabric this

00:56:57.279 --> 00:56:57.289
a sort of almost as a as a fabric this
 

00:56:57.289 --> 00:56:58.859
a sort of almost as a as a fabric this
is just pictures during construction

00:56:58.859 --> 00:56:58.869
is just pictures during construction
 

00:56:58.869 --> 00:57:01.559
is just pictures during construction
it's pretty tough to a built in no way

00:57:01.559 --> 00:57:01.569
it's pretty tough to a built in no way
 

00:57:01.569 --> 00:57:06.009
it's pretty tough to a built in no way
okay gets Revere great really cold and

00:57:06.009 --> 00:57:06.019
okay gets Revere great really cold and
 

00:57:06.019 --> 00:57:12.910
okay gets Revere great really cold and
snowy so this is the making so finally

00:57:12.910 --> 00:57:12.920
snowy so this is the making so finally
 

00:57:12.920 --> 00:57:15.039
snowy so this is the making so finally
in October we started construction and

00:57:15.039 --> 00:57:15.049
in October we started construction and
 

00:57:15.049 --> 00:57:17.890
in October we started construction and
this is just as a kind of a kind of

00:57:17.890 --> 00:57:17.900
this is just as a kind of a kind of
 

00:57:17.900 --> 00:57:20.079
this is just as a kind of a kind of
symbol you know we had we decapitated

00:57:20.079 --> 00:57:20.089
symbol you know we had we decapitated
 

00:57:20.089 --> 00:57:23.319
symbol you know we had we decapitated
the existing ski job so I took the head

00:57:23.319 --> 00:57:23.329
the existing ski job so I took the head
 

00:57:23.329 --> 00:57:26.289
the existing ski job so I took the head
off and it's actually still lying on

00:57:26.289 --> 00:57:26.299
off and it's actually still lying on
 

00:57:26.299 --> 00:57:28.779
off and it's actually still lying on
side next door I don't know what they

00:57:28.779 --> 00:57:28.789
side next door I don't know what they
 

00:57:28.789 --> 00:57:31.089
side next door I don't know what they
got to do with it he's just going to

00:57:31.089 --> 00:57:31.099
got to do with it he's just going to
 

00:57:31.099 --> 00:57:34.089
got to do with it he's just going to
stand there and rot so this was the

00:57:34.089 --> 00:57:34.099
stand there and rot so this was the
 

00:57:34.099 --> 00:57:37.079
stand there and rot so this was the
first in a way the first condition of

00:57:37.079 --> 00:57:37.089
first in a way the first condition of
 

00:57:37.089 --> 00:57:39.160
first in a way the first condition of
construction and the first failure is

00:57:39.160 --> 00:57:39.170
construction and the first failure is
 

00:57:39.170 --> 00:57:41.890
construction and the first failure is
that you can see that this existing

00:57:41.890 --> 00:57:41.900
that you can see that this existing
 

00:57:41.900 --> 00:57:44.650
that you can see that this existing
building around which we building is is

00:57:44.650 --> 00:57:44.660
building around which we building is is
 

00:57:44.660 --> 00:57:48.689
building around which we building is is
a sort of a remain of the OL jam and

00:57:48.689 --> 00:57:48.699
a sort of a remain of the OL jam and
 

00:57:48.699 --> 00:57:51.160
a sort of a remain of the OL jam and
it's something I'm still trying to get

00:57:51.160 --> 00:57:51.170
it's something I'm still trying to get
 

00:57:51.170 --> 00:57:54.660
it's something I'm still trying to get
rid of but I don't think I'm managing

00:57:54.660 --> 00:57:54.670
rid of but I don't think I'm managing
 

00:57:54.670 --> 00:57:58.209
rid of but I don't think I'm managing
it's what's what we call the cubic it's

00:57:58.209 --> 00:57:58.219
it's what's what we call the cubic it's
 

00:57:58.219 --> 00:58:00.400
it's what's what we call the cubic it's
an existing administration building that

00:58:00.400 --> 00:58:00.410
an existing administration building that
 

00:58:00.410 --> 00:58:05.859
an existing administration building that
is somehow being excuse to call this

00:58:05.859 --> 00:58:05.869
is somehow being excuse to call this
 

00:58:05.869 --> 00:58:08.650
is somehow being excuse to call this
renovation and not a new build on a

00:58:08.650 --> 00:58:08.660
renovation and not a new build on a
 

00:58:08.660 --> 00:58:12.339
renovation and not a new build on a
political level so is this big question

00:58:12.339 --> 00:58:12.349
political level so is this big question
 

00:58:12.349 --> 00:58:13.689
political level so is this big question
of whether we have the cool big are we

00:58:13.689 --> 00:58:13.699
of whether we have the cool big are we
 

00:58:13.699 --> 00:58:16.989
of whether we have the cool big are we
actually deal with it and try to take it

00:58:16.989 --> 00:58:16.999
actually deal with it and try to take it
 

00:58:16.999 --> 00:58:20.890
actually deal with it and try to take it
away or slice it so that there is a

00:58:20.890 --> 00:58:20.900
away or slice it so that there is a
 

00:58:20.900 --> 00:58:22.779
away or slice it so that there is a
visual connection between the two sides

00:58:22.779 --> 00:58:22.789
visual connection between the two sides
 

00:58:22.789 --> 00:58:25.059
visual connection between the two sides
of the ski jump which is has been the

00:58:25.059 --> 00:58:25.069
of the ski jump which is has been the
 

00:58:25.069 --> 00:58:26.650
of the ski jump which is has been the
intention for the from the competition

00:58:26.650 --> 00:58:26.660
intention for the from the competition
 

00:58:26.660 --> 00:58:31.419
intention for the from the competition
all along so basically the idea is that

00:58:31.419 --> 00:58:31.429
all along so basically the idea is that
 

00:58:31.429 --> 00:58:33.339
all along so basically the idea is that
you have the lobby entrance here and

00:58:33.339 --> 00:58:33.349
you have the lobby entrance here and
 

00:58:33.349 --> 00:58:36.579
you have the lobby entrance here and
then you could go down you know into the

00:58:36.579 --> 00:58:36.589
then you could go down you know into the
 

00:58:36.589 --> 00:58:39.189
then you could go down you know into the
arena from this staircase existing

00:58:39.189 --> 00:58:39.199
arena from this staircase existing
 

00:58:39.199 --> 00:58:41.100
arena from this staircase existing
building and

00:58:41.100 --> 00:58:41.110
building and
 

00:58:41.110 --> 00:58:43.260
building and
have this so interaction of the

00:58:43.260 --> 00:58:43.270
have this so interaction of the
 

00:58:43.270 --> 00:58:45.870
have this so interaction of the
different programs but currently it's

00:58:45.870 --> 00:58:45.880
different programs but currently it's
 

00:58:45.880 --> 00:58:48.510
different programs but currently it's
working like this and not like this as

00:58:48.510 --> 00:58:48.520
working like this and not like this as
 

00:58:48.520 --> 00:58:52.260
working like this and not like this as
we're trying to get it hard to see

00:58:52.260 --> 00:58:52.270
we're trying to get it hard to see
 

00:58:52.270 --> 00:58:56.570
we're trying to get it hard to see
anything so this is the underside of the

00:58:56.570 --> 00:58:56.580
anything so this is the underside of the
 

00:58:56.580 --> 00:59:00.420
anything so this is the underside of the
the jump and this is when we started

00:59:00.420 --> 00:59:00.430
the jump and this is when we started
 

00:59:00.430 --> 00:59:02.880
the jump and this is when we started
like you know feeling how the jump would

00:59:02.880 --> 00:59:02.890
like you know feeling how the jump would
 

00:59:02.890 --> 00:59:08.700
like you know feeling how the jump would
be and the sort of various steps of

00:59:08.700 --> 00:59:08.710
be and the sort of various steps of
 

00:59:08.710 --> 00:59:14.880
be and the sort of various steps of
building the structure I'm just trying

00:59:14.880 --> 00:59:14.890
building the structure I'm just trying
 

00:59:14.890 --> 00:59:19.230
building the structure I'm just trying
to go through this was like a midterm of

00:59:19.230 --> 00:59:19.240
to go through this was like a midterm of
 

00:59:19.240 --> 00:59:22.230
to go through this was like a midterm of
his visits where we brought the whole

00:59:22.230 --> 00:59:22.240
his visits where we brought the whole
 

00:59:22.240 --> 00:59:25.980
his visits where we brought the whole
office to see the jump like I said it's

00:59:25.980 --> 00:59:25.990
office to see the jump like I said it's
 

00:59:25.990 --> 00:59:27.900
office to see the jump like I said it's
a really tough place to build like a

00:59:27.900 --> 00:59:27.910
a really tough place to build like a
 

00:59:27.910 --> 00:59:30.210
a really tough place to build like a
it's foggy almost like half of the time

00:59:30.210 --> 00:59:30.220
it's foggy almost like half of the time
 

00:59:30.220 --> 00:59:33.960
it's foggy almost like half of the time
and then number on the form of 24 we

00:59:33.960 --> 00:59:33.970
and then number on the form of 24 we
 

00:59:33.970 --> 00:59:39.150
and then number on the form of 24 we
raised up the last piece the 8 section

00:59:39.150 --> 00:59:39.160
raised up the last piece the 8 section
 

00:59:39.160 --> 00:59:41.900
raised up the last piece the 8 section
of the drum which is pretty dramatic

00:59:41.900 --> 00:59:41.910
of the drum which is pretty dramatic
 

00:59:41.910 --> 00:59:44.700
of the drum which is pretty dramatic
experience especially when you get

00:59:44.700 --> 00:59:44.710
experience especially when you get
 

00:59:44.710 --> 00:59:46.320
experience especially when you get
closer and closer and these dudes were

00:59:46.320 --> 00:59:46.330
closer and closer and these dudes were
 

00:59:46.330 --> 00:59:49.140
closer and closer and these dudes were
just smoking cigarettes and like holding

00:59:49.140 --> 00:59:49.150
just smoking cigarettes and like holding
 

00:59:49.150 --> 00:59:51.590
just smoking cigarettes and like holding
and other thing

00:59:51.590 --> 00:59:51.600
and other thing
 

00:59:51.600 --> 00:59:55.790
and other thing
I really a and then that's when you know

00:59:55.790 --> 00:59:55.800
I really a and then that's when you know
 

00:59:55.800 --> 00:59:57.500
I really a and then that's when you know
you're working in a sort of the Viking

00:59:57.500 --> 00:59:57.510
you're working in a sort of the Viking
 

00:59:57.510 --> 01:00:04.940
you're working in a sort of the Viking
I'll and so it took it took a while to

01:00:04.940 --> 01:00:04.950
I'll and so it took it took a while to
 

01:00:04.950 --> 01:00:06.740
I'll and so it took it took a while to
get it in place because of the wind and

01:00:06.740 --> 01:00:06.750
get it in place because of the wind and
 

01:00:06.750 --> 01:00:09.440
get it in place because of the wind and
that last piece was heavier than most of

01:00:09.440 --> 01:00:09.450
that last piece was heavier than most of
 

01:00:09.450 --> 01:00:13.460
that last piece was heavier than most of
the other one you can see that the the

01:00:13.460 --> 01:00:13.470
the other one you can see that the the
 

01:00:13.470 --> 01:00:16.570
the other one you can see that the the
connection was made then we kept the

01:00:16.570 --> 01:00:16.580
connection was made then we kept the
 

01:00:16.580 --> 01:00:19.970
connection was made then we kept the
crane holding it for quite a while while

01:00:19.970 --> 01:00:19.980
crane holding it for quite a while while
 

01:00:19.980 --> 01:00:22.130
crane holding it for quite a while while
it was being like really sort of

01:00:22.130 --> 01:00:22.140
it was being like really sort of
 

01:00:22.140 --> 01:00:26.090
it was being like really sort of
gradually to test that you know the

01:00:26.090 --> 01:00:26.100
gradually to test that you know the
 

01:00:26.100 --> 01:00:29.330
gradually to test that you know the
cantilever was working i love this is

01:00:29.330 --> 01:00:29.340
cantilever was working i love this is
 

01:00:29.340 --> 01:00:32.210
cantilever was working i love this is
the moment of lack of trust in in

01:00:32.210 --> 01:00:32.220
the moment of lack of trust in in
 

01:00:32.220 --> 01:00:34.780
the moment of lack of trust in in
whatever you know engineering has been a

01:00:34.780 --> 01:00:34.790
whatever you know engineering has been a
 

01:00:34.790 --> 01:00:44.320
whatever you know engineering has been a
sort of deployed and so at some point

01:00:44.320 --> 01:00:44.330
sort of deployed and so at some point
 

01:00:44.330 --> 01:00:48.590
sort of deployed and so at some point
some guy started coming into the hill

01:00:48.590 --> 01:00:48.600
some guy started coming into the hill
 

01:00:48.600 --> 01:00:50.780
some guy started coming into the hill
like of course it was far from being

01:00:50.780 --> 01:00:50.790
like of course it was far from being
 

01:00:50.790 --> 01:00:53.660
like of course it was far from being
ready but you know it's too tempting so

01:00:53.660 --> 01:00:53.670
ready but you know it's too tempting so
 

01:00:53.670 --> 01:00:55.760
ready but you know it's too tempting so
locally it's such a big you know like

01:00:55.760 --> 01:00:55.770
locally it's such a big you know like
 

01:00:55.770 --> 01:00:58.220
locally it's such a big you know like
people like the entire neighborhood of

01:00:58.220 --> 01:00:58.230
people like the entire neighborhood of
 

01:00:58.230 --> 01:00:59.840
people like the entire neighborhood of
people living just next to the ski time

01:00:59.840 --> 01:00:59.850
people living just next to the ski time
 

01:00:59.850 --> 01:01:01.790
people living just next to the ski time
and they're all like total fanatic

01:01:01.790 --> 01:01:01.800
and they're all like total fanatic
 

01:01:01.800 --> 01:01:03.470
and they're all like total fanatic
skiers so of course at some point you

01:01:03.470 --> 01:01:03.480
skiers so of course at some point you
 

01:01:03.480 --> 01:01:05.570
skiers so of course at some point you
know some kid get drunk and they're like

01:01:05.570 --> 01:01:05.580
know some kid get drunk and they're like
 

01:01:05.580 --> 01:01:08.750
know some kid get drunk and they're like
okay let's let's do it now so that was

01:01:08.750 --> 01:01:08.760
okay let's let's do it now so that was
 

01:01:08.760 --> 01:01:11.480
okay let's let's do it now so that was
the first the first moment then a

01:01:11.480 --> 01:01:11.490
the first the first moment then a
 

01:01:11.490 --> 01:01:15.800
the first the first moment then a
construction went on until it was sort

01:01:15.800 --> 01:01:15.810
construction went on until it was sort
 

01:01:15.810 --> 01:01:20.060
construction went on until it was sort
of getting close to completion this is

01:01:20.060 --> 01:01:20.070
of getting close to completion this is
 

01:01:20.070 --> 01:01:22.160
of getting close to completion this is
when we started doing so basically like

01:01:22.160 --> 01:01:22.170
when we started doing so basically like
 

01:01:22.170 --> 01:01:27.160
when we started doing so basically like
all this inside stuff is you know just

01:01:27.160 --> 01:01:27.170
all this inside stuff is you know just
 

01:01:27.170 --> 01:01:29.030
all this inside stuff is you know just
backbone for placing all the

01:01:29.030 --> 01:01:29.040
backbone for placing all the
 

01:01:29.040 --> 01:01:30.590
backbone for placing all the
installations because there's a lot of

01:01:30.590 --> 01:01:30.600
installations because there's a lot of
 

01:01:30.600 --> 01:01:34.130
installations because there's a lot of
insertion going into the structure and

01:01:34.130 --> 01:01:34.140
insertion going into the structure and
 

01:01:34.140 --> 01:01:37.310
insertion going into the structure and
then the project was more or less say it

01:01:37.310 --> 01:01:37.320
then the project was more or less say it
 

01:01:37.320 --> 01:01:40.460
then the project was more or less say it
done in its basic form I mean you can

01:01:40.460 --> 01:01:40.470
done in its basic form I mean you can
 

01:01:40.470 --> 01:01:42.140
done in its basic form I mean you can
see that it's still not done over here

01:01:42.140 --> 01:01:42.150
see that it's still not done over here
 

01:01:42.150 --> 01:01:45.290
see that it's still not done over here
but it's all is done with the facade and

01:01:45.290 --> 01:01:45.300
but it's all is done with the facade and
 

01:01:45.300 --> 01:01:48.680
but it's all is done with the facade and
then some guys came over and base jump

01:01:48.680 --> 01:01:48.690
then some guys came over and base jump
 

01:01:48.690 --> 01:01:50.070
then some guys came over and base jump
did and

01:01:50.070 --> 01:01:50.080
did and
 

01:01:50.080 --> 01:01:53.100
did and
it's like the sort of ivory only really

01:01:53.100 --> 01:01:53.110

01:02:04.630 --> 01:02:07.440
like I stare at the time and so they
just had to get up and then they base

01:02:07.440 --> 01:02:07.450
just had to get up and then they base
 

01:02:07.450 --> 01:02:11.840
just had to get up and then they base
jumped the sky intense and then another

01:02:11.840 --> 01:02:11.850

01:02:11.850 --> 01:02:14.520
jumped the sky intense and then another
little issue that happened is that

01:02:14.520 --> 01:02:14.530
little issue that happened is that
 

01:02:14.530 --> 01:02:19.050

01:07:45.940 --> 01:07:45.950
ideas that came and this is what makes
 

01:07:45.950 --> 01:07:48.370
ideas that came and this is what makes
you know the profession really exciting

01:07:48.370 --> 01:07:48.380
you know the profession really exciting
 

01:07:48.380 --> 01:07:54.010
you know the profession really exciting
obviously but in countries that are you

01:07:54.010 --> 01:07:54.020
obviously but in countries that are you
 

01:07:54.020 --> 01:07:56.200
obviously but in countries that are you
know much further away like so doing

01:07:56.200 --> 01:07:56.210
know much further away like so doing
 

01:07:56.210 --> 01:07:59.500
know much further away like so doing
some work in Mexico or like in Asia it's

01:07:59.500 --> 01:07:59.510
some work in Mexico or like in Asia it's
 

01:07:59.510 --> 01:08:03.430
some work in Mexico or like in Asia it's
harder to first to convince yourself to

01:08:03.430 --> 01:08:03.440
harder to first to convince yourself to
 

01:08:03.440 --> 01:08:06.069
harder to first to convince yourself to
do it and then in order to convince your

01:08:06.069 --> 01:08:06.079
do it and then in order to convince your
 

01:08:06.079 --> 01:08:08.950
do it and then in order to convince your
client to go for it all you have to

01:08:08.950 --> 01:08:08.960
client to go for it all you have to
 

01:08:08.960 --> 01:08:11.559
client to go for it all you have to
again you know open I think if we had

01:08:11.559 --> 01:08:11.569
again you know open I think if we had
 

01:08:11.569 --> 01:08:12.849
again you know open I think if we had
really fought for it we could have

01:08:12.849 --> 01:08:12.859
really fought for it we could have
 

01:08:12.859 --> 01:08:15.460
really fought for it we could have
avoided to set up in our local office

01:08:15.460 --> 01:08:15.470
avoided to set up in our local office
 

01:08:15.470 --> 01:08:17.680
avoided to set up in our local office
for the ski jump because we were only an

01:08:17.680 --> 01:08:17.690
for the ski jump because we were only an
 

01:08:17.690 --> 01:08:19.720
for the ski jump because we were only an
hour away I think it's a lot harder when

01:08:19.720 --> 01:08:19.730
hour away I think it's a lot harder when
 

01:08:19.730 --> 01:08:22.720
hour away I think it's a lot harder when
you like you know having to travel 12

01:08:22.720 --> 01:08:22.730
you like you know having to travel 12
 

01:08:22.730 --> 01:08:29.019
you like you know having to travel 12
hours and so I think we we would

01:08:29.019 --> 01:08:29.029
hours and so I think we we would
 

01:08:29.029 --> 01:08:31.930
hours and so I think we we would
probably be more keen on either opening

01:08:31.930 --> 01:08:31.940
probably be more keen on either opening
 

01:08:31.940 --> 01:08:34.720
probably be more keen on either opening
offices or sort of working with someone

01:08:34.720 --> 01:08:34.730
offices or sort of working with someone
 

01:08:34.730 --> 01:08:37.120
offices or sort of working with someone
locally if it was like further away

01:08:37.120 --> 01:08:37.130
locally if it was like further away
 

01:08:37.130 --> 01:08:39.760
locally if it was like further away
project but I haven't really have done

01:08:39.760 --> 01:08:39.770
project but I haven't really have done
 

01:08:39.770 --> 01:08:42.570

collaborations with offices in China

01:08:42.570 --> 01:08:42.580

where they've been doing the detailing
 

01:08:45.080 --> 01:08:49.660
where they've been doing the detailing
and we've been redlining it and we still

01:08:49.660 --> 01:08:49.670
and we've been redlining it and we still
 

01:08:49.670 --> 01:08:50.670
and we've been redlining it and we still
waiting for

01:08:50.670 --> 01:08:50.680
waiting for
 

01:08:50.680 --> 01:08:54.390
waiting for
the canner drawing to redline it's like

01:08:54.390 --> 01:08:54.400
the canner drawing to redline it's like
 

01:08:54.400 --> 01:08:57.260
the canner drawing to redline it's like
it's really sort of something to

01:08:57.260 --> 01:08:57.270
it's really sort of something to
 

01:08:57.270 --> 01:09:01.770
it's really sort of something to
remember in the energy much more I mean

01:09:01.770 --> 01:09:01.780
remember in the energy much more I mean
 

01:09:01.780 --> 01:09:03.330
remember in the energy much more I mean
depending on the project some project

01:09:03.330 --> 01:09:03.340
depending on the project some project
 

01:09:03.340 --> 01:09:08.130
depending on the project some project

01:09:08.130 --> 01:09:08.140
are sort of sufficiently standard that
 

01:09:08.140 --> 01:09:11.430
are sort of sufficiently standard that
you can do it interestingly enough I

01:09:11.430 --> 01:09:11.440
you can do it interestingly enough I
 

01:09:11.440 --> 01:09:13.890
you can do it interestingly enough I

didn't go through it because there you

01:09:27.660 --> 01:09:27.670
didn't go through it because there you
 

01:09:27.670 --> 01:09:30.450
didn't go through it because there you
know we didn't do the full package we

01:09:30.450 --> 01:09:30.460
know we didn't do the full package we
 

01:09:30.460 --> 01:09:33.810
know we didn't do the full package we
didn't draw the details of it we had a

01:09:33.810 --> 01:09:33.820
didn't draw the details of it we had a
 

01:09:33.820 --> 01:09:38.070
didn't draw the details of it we had a
local office do it and yeah like I'm not

01:09:38.070 --> 01:09:38.080
local office do it and yeah like I'm not
 

01:09:38.080 --> 01:09:41.070
local office do it and yeah like I'm not
sure that the you know I would want you

01:09:41.070 --> 01:09:41.080
sure that the you know I would want you
 

01:09:41.080 --> 01:09:42.690
sure that the you know I would want you
to see it actually I mean there's a lot

01:09:42.690 --> 01:09:42.700
to see it actually I mean there's a lot
 

01:09:42.700 --> 01:09:44.760
to see it actually I mean there's a lot
of aspects where we didn't have to we

01:09:44.760 --> 01:09:44.770
of aspects where we didn't have to we
 

01:09:44.770 --> 01:09:46.380
of aspects where we didn't have to we
didn't get the chance to battle I mean

01:09:46.380 --> 01:09:46.390
didn't get the chance to battle I mean
 

01:09:46.390 --> 01:09:48.870
didn't get the chance to battle I mean
we didn't get simply the occasion they

01:09:48.870 --> 01:09:48.880
we didn't get simply the occasion they
 

01:09:48.880 --> 01:09:51.120
we didn't get simply the occasion they
can die capacity to to be involving

01:09:51.120 --> 01:09:51.130
can die capacity to to be involving
 

01:09:51.130 --> 01:09:53.730
can die capacity to to be involving
decisions and I think that's there's a

01:09:53.730 --> 01:09:53.740
decisions and I think that's there's a
 

01:09:53.740 --> 01:09:55.500
decisions and I think that's there's a
big learning actually it's something

01:09:55.500 --> 01:09:55.510
big learning actually it's something
 

01:09:55.510 --> 01:10:01.020
big learning actually it's something
that we need to avoid all we need to be

01:10:01.020 --> 01:10:01.030
that we need to avoid all we need to be
 

01:10:01.030 --> 01:10:02.670
that we need to avoid all we need to be
better at sort of selling of those

01:10:02.670 --> 01:10:02.680
better at sort of selling of those
 

01:10:02.680 --> 01:10:04.620
better at sort of selling of those
collaboration in a really

01:10:04.620 --> 01:10:04.630
collaboration in a really
 

01:10:04.630 --> 01:10:07.470
collaboration in a really
the way that we know who we deal with

the way that we know who we deal with
 

01:10:07.480 --> 01:10:20.800
the way that we know who we deal with
and we know what all arise

presentation there was some very

01:10:26.800 --> 01:10:26.810
presentation there was some very
 

01:10:26.810 --> 01:10:29.500
presentation there was some very
interesting ideas in there the thing

01:10:29.500 --> 01:10:29.510
interesting ideas in there the thing
 

01:10:29.510 --> 01:10:31.630
interesting ideas in there the thing
that I kind of jumped out at me from it

01:10:31.630 --> 01:10:31.640
that I kind of jumped out at me from it
 

01:10:31.640 --> 01:10:33.490
that I kind of jumped out at me from it
was looking at here at some of the

01:10:33.490 --> 01:10:33.500
was looking at here at some of the
 

01:10:33.500 --> 01:10:35.380
was looking at here at some of the
project that you presented and maybe

01:10:35.380 --> 01:10:35.390
project that you presented and maybe
 

01:10:35.390 --> 01:10:37.240
project that you presented and maybe
it's not something the office in general

01:10:37.240 --> 01:10:37.250
it's not something the office in general
 

01:10:37.250 --> 01:10:40.300
it's not something the office in general
but there's a certain scale about your

01:10:40.300 --> 01:10:40.310
but there's a certain scale about your
 

01:10:40.310 --> 01:10:43.000
but there's a certain scale about your
project I mean the ski-jump has a bit of

01:10:43.000 --> 01:10:43.010
project I mean the ski-jump has a bit of
 

01:10:43.010 --> 01:10:44.290
project I mean the ski-jump has a bit of
a scale on its own that you cannot

01:10:44.290 --> 01:10:44.300
a scale on its own that you cannot
 

01:10:44.300 --> 01:10:46.390
a scale on its own that you cannot
really play around with too much but I

01:10:46.390 --> 01:10:46.400
really play around with too much but I
 

01:10:46.400 --> 01:10:47.770
really play around with too much but I
was looking at the other one namely the

01:10:47.770 --> 01:10:47.780
was looking at the other one namely the
 

01:10:47.780 --> 01:10:50.590
was looking at the other one namely the
China one with the tower and the two

01:10:50.590 --> 01:10:50.600
China one with the tower and the two
 

01:10:50.600 --> 01:10:52.960
China one with the tower and the two
theater project where it seemed to be

01:10:52.960 --> 01:10:52.970
theater project where it seemed to be
 

01:10:52.970 --> 01:10:55.900
theater project where it seemed to be
pretty massive compared to its context

01:10:55.900 --> 01:10:55.910
pretty massive compared to its context
 

01:10:55.910 --> 01:11:00.190
pretty massive compared to its context
and almost the out of scale compared to

01:11:00.190 --> 01:11:00.200
and almost the out of scale compared to
 

01:11:00.200 --> 01:11:03.580
and almost the out of scale compared to
what it is where it's located I'm

01:11:03.580 --> 01:11:03.590
what it is where it's located I'm
 

01:11:03.590 --> 01:11:04.900
what it is where it's located I'm
wondering that ever came up in

01:11:04.900 --> 01:11:04.910
wondering that ever came up in
 

01:11:04.910 --> 01:11:07.180
wondering that ever came up in
conversation or like public or against

01:11:07.180 --> 01:11:07.190
conversation or like public or against
 

01:11:07.190 --> 01:11:09.940
conversation or like public or against
it saying that's too big or if that ever

01:11:09.940 --> 01:11:09.950
it saying that's too big or if that ever
 

01:11:09.950 --> 01:11:12.640
it saying that's too big or if that ever
comes in conversation during the design

01:11:12.640 --> 01:11:12.650
comes in conversation during the design
 

01:11:12.650 --> 01:11:14.650
comes in conversation during the design
process where the scale becomes an issue

01:11:14.650 --> 01:11:14.660
process where the scale becomes an issue
 

01:11:14.660 --> 01:11:17.620
process where the scale becomes an issue
or it may be too big or kind of out of

01:11:17.620 --> 01:11:17.630
or it may be too big or kind of out of
 

01:11:17.630 --> 01:11:20.080
or it may be too big or kind of out of
place in that sense and if you can

01:11:20.080 --> 01:11:20.090
place in that sense and if you can
 

01:11:20.090 --> 01:11:24.280
place in that sense and if you can
comment on that I did I think the

01:11:24.280 --> 01:11:24.290
comment on that I did I think the
 

01:11:24.290 --> 01:11:28.840
comment on that I did I think the
Chinese one is it's definitely to be but

01:11:28.840 --> 01:11:28.850
Chinese one is it's definitely to be but
 

01:11:28.850 --> 01:11:30.450
Chinese one is it's definitely to be but
you know that was part of the

01:11:30.450 --> 01:11:30.460
you know that was part of the
 

01:11:30.460 --> 01:11:36.700
you know that was part of the
requirement I don't think you know the

01:11:36.700 --> 01:11:36.710
requirement I don't think you know the
 

01:11:36.710 --> 01:11:37.960
requirement I don't think you know the
two other ones that being a pretty I

01:11:37.960 --> 01:11:37.970
two other ones that being a pretty I
 

01:11:37.970 --> 01:11:39.820
two other ones that being a pretty I
mean they're basically smaller than the

01:11:39.820 --> 01:11:39.830
mean they're basically smaller than the
 

01:11:39.830 --> 01:11:41.950
mean they're basically smaller than the
neighbors so I don't think they're kind

01:11:41.950 --> 01:11:41.960
neighbors so I don't think they're kind
 

01:11:41.960 --> 01:11:45.130
neighbors so I don't think they're kind
of fit in the to be category but I think

01:11:45.130 --> 01:11:45.140
of fit in the to be category but I think
 

01:11:45.140 --> 01:11:50.530
of fit in the to be category but I think
just maybe generally the issue of a I'm

01:11:50.530 --> 01:11:50.540
just maybe generally the issue of a I'm
 

01:11:50.540 --> 01:11:52.780
just maybe generally the issue of a I'm
fighting a building permit right now in

01:11:52.780 --> 01:11:52.790
fighting a building permit right now in
 

01:11:52.790 --> 01:11:55.870
fighting a building permit right now in
Brussels for the exact same reason that

Brussels for the exact same reason that
 

01:11:55.880 --> 01:11:58.060
Brussels for the exact same reason that
I'm being told that the building is too

01:11:58.060 --> 01:11:58.070
I'm being told that the building is too
 

01:11:58.070 --> 01:12:00.400
I'm being told that the building is too
big it's like two storeys above you know

01:12:00.400 --> 01:12:00.410
big it's like two storeys above you know
 

01:12:00.410 --> 01:12:03.370
big it's like two storeys above you know
the neighbors but whatever and thing in

01:12:03.370 --> 01:12:03.380
the neighbors but whatever and thing in
 

01:12:03.380 --> 01:12:05.980
