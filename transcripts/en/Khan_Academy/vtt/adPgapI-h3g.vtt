00:00:00.193 --> 00:00:01.342
- [Voiceover] So we have an equation.

00:00:01.342 --> 00:00:05.786
It says, a-x plus three-x
is equal to b-x plus five.

00:00:05.786 --> 00:00:09.418
And what I want to do
together is to solve for x,

00:00:09.418 --> 00:00:11.047
and if we solve for x it's going to be

00:00:11.047 --> 00:00:14.391
in terms of a, b, and other numbers.

00:00:14.391 --> 00:00:17.038
So pause the video and
see if you can do that.

00:00:17.038 --> 00:00:18.640
All right now, let's do this together,

00:00:18.640 --> 00:00:19.260
and what I'm going to do,

00:00:19.260 --> 00:00:21.349
is I'm gonna try to
group all of the x-terms,

00:00:21.349 --> 00:00:23.353
let's group all the x-terms
on the left-hand side.

00:00:23.353 --> 00:00:25.953
So, I already have a-x and
three-x on the left-hand side.

00:00:25.953 --> 00:00:29.309
Let's get b-x onto the left-hand
side as well, and I can do

00:00:29.309 --> 00:00:34.057
that by subtracting b-x from both sides.

00:00:34.057 --> 00:00:37.551
And if I subtract b-x from both sides,

00:00:37.551 --> 00:00:41.499
I'm going to get on the right-hand side,

00:00:41.499 --> 00:00:44.192
I'm going to have a, or
on the left-hand side,

00:00:44.192 --> 00:00:47.984
a-x plus three-x

00:00:47.984 --> 00:00:52.701
minus b-x, so I can do
that in that color for fun,

00:00:52.701 --> 00:00:56.996
minus b-x, and that's
going to be equal to...

00:00:56.996 --> 00:00:59.155
Well, b-x minus b-x is just zero,

00:00:59.155 --> 00:01:00.211
and I have five.

00:01:00.211 --> 00:01:02.255
It is equal to five.

00:01:02.255 --> 00:01:04.251
And now what I can do is,

00:01:04.251 --> 00:01:07.015
I can factor an x out
of this left-hand side

00:01:07.015 --> 00:01:09.116
of this equation, out of all of the terms.

00:01:09.116 --> 00:01:12.796
So, I can rewrite this as x times...

00:01:12.796 --> 00:01:15.792
Well, a-x divided by x is a.

00:01:15.792 --> 00:01:18.589
Three-x divided by x is three,

00:01:18.589 --> 00:01:20.585
and then negative b-x divided by x

00:01:20.585 --> 00:01:23.847
is just going to be negative b.

00:01:23.847 --> 00:01:26.545
I could keep writing
it in that pink color.

00:01:26.545 --> 00:01:28.862
And that's all going to be equal to five.

00:01:28.862 --> 00:01:30.709
And now, to solve for x I can just divide

00:01:30.709 --> 00:01:35.166
both sides by, the thing that
x is being multiplied by,

00:01:35.166 --> 00:01:37.329
by a plus three minus b.

00:01:37.329 --> 00:01:40.013
So, I can divide both sides by

00:01:40.013 --> 00:01:44.237
a plus three minus b.

00:01:44.237 --> 00:01:47.175
A plus three minus b.

00:01:47.175 --> 00:01:49.415
On this side, they cancel out.

00:01:49.415 --> 00:01:52.515
And, I have x is equal to five

00:01:52.515 --> 00:01:56.598
over a plus three

00:01:56.598 --> 00:01:59.747
minus b, and we are done.

00:01:59.747 --> 00:02:02.394
Let's do one more of these.

00:02:02.394 --> 00:02:03.729
So, another equation here.

00:02:03.729 --> 00:02:04.936
We have a...

00:02:04.936 --> 00:02:09.487
Here we have a times the
quantity, five minus x,

00:02:09.487 --> 00:02:11.496
is equal to b-x minus eight.

00:02:11.496 --> 00:02:12.796
So, once again, pause the video

00:02:12.796 --> 00:02:16.020
and see if you can solve for x.

00:02:16.020 --> 00:02:17.428
Well, the way I like to approach these

00:02:17.428 --> 00:02:20.028
is let's just expand everything all out.

00:02:20.028 --> 00:02:21.386
So, let me just distribute this a,

00:02:21.386 --> 00:02:23.454
and then I'm gonna collect
all the x-terms on one side,

00:02:23.454 --> 00:02:25.670
and all of the non-x-terms
on the other side,

00:02:25.670 --> 00:02:28.526
and essentially do what I
just did in the last example.

00:02:28.526 --> 00:02:31.068
So, let's first distribute this a.

00:02:31.068 --> 00:02:33.343
So the left-hand side becomes

00:02:33.343 --> 00:02:36.571
five-a, I could say a
times five or five-a,

00:02:36.571 --> 00:02:40.567
minus a-x, a-x,

00:02:40.567 --> 00:02:43.269
that is going to be equal to

00:02:43.269 --> 00:02:45.743
b-x minus eight.

00:02:45.743 --> 00:02:48.854
Now we can subtract b-x from both sides.

00:02:48.854 --> 00:02:51.303
So, we're gonna subtract
b-x from the left-hand side,

00:02:51.303 --> 00:02:52.812
b-x from the right-hand side.

00:02:52.812 --> 00:02:53.950
And, once again, the whole
reason I'm doing that,

00:02:53.950 --> 00:02:55.702
I want all the x-terms on the left,

00:02:55.702 --> 00:02:58.082
and all the non-x-terms on the right.

00:02:58.082 --> 00:03:01.530
And, actually, since I want all
the non-x-terms on the right,

00:03:01.530 --> 00:03:04.894
I can actually subtract five-a
from both sides, as well.

00:03:04.894 --> 00:03:06.634
So I'm kind of doing
two steps at once, here,

00:03:06.634 --> 00:03:07.621
but hopefully it makes sense.

00:03:07.621 --> 00:03:09.483
I'm trying to get rid of the b-x here,

00:03:09.483 --> 00:03:11.247
and I'm trying to get
rid of the five-a here.

00:03:11.247 --> 00:03:13.290
So, I subtract five-a there,

00:03:13.290 --> 00:03:15.809
and I'll subtract five-a there,

00:03:15.809 --> 00:03:19.164
and then let's see what this give us.

00:03:19.164 --> 00:03:21.207
So, the five-a's cancel out.

00:03:21.207 --> 00:03:22.264
And, on the left-hand side,

00:03:22.264 --> 00:03:24.539
I have negative a-x,

00:03:24.539 --> 00:03:26.769
negative a-x,

00:03:26.769 --> 00:03:28.659
minus b-x,

00:03:29.510 --> 00:03:33.269
minus, you know, in that same green color,

00:03:33.269 --> 00:03:35.104
minus b-x.

00:03:35.104 --> 00:03:37.148
And on the right-hand side,

00:03:37.148 --> 00:03:37.982
I have...

00:03:37.982 --> 00:03:38.888
This is going to be equal to,

00:03:38.888 --> 00:03:40.420
the b-x's cancel out,

00:03:40.420 --> 00:03:44.359
and I have negative eight minus five-a.

00:03:44.359 --> 00:03:47.304
Negative eight minus,

00:03:47.304 --> 00:03:49.707
in that same magenta color,

00:03:49.707 --> 00:03:52.586
minus five-a.

00:03:52.586 --> 00:03:55.977
And let's see, I have all my x's

00:03:55.977 --> 00:03:58.484
on one side, all my
non-x's on the other side.

00:03:58.484 --> 00:04:01.386
And here I can factor out an x,

00:04:01.386 --> 00:04:04.555
and if I factor out an x, what do I have?

00:04:04.555 --> 00:04:05.681
And, actually, one thing
that might be nice.

00:04:05.681 --> 00:04:08.317
Let me just multiply both
sides by negative one.

00:04:08.317 --> 00:04:10.139
If I multiple both sides by negative one,

00:04:10.139 --> 00:04:13.785
I get a-x plus b-x,

00:04:13.785 --> 00:04:17.941
plus b-x is equal to

00:04:17.941 --> 00:04:20.274
eight plus five-a.

00:04:20.274 --> 00:04:22.945
That just gets rid of all
of those negative signs.

00:04:22.945 --> 00:04:25.800
And now I can factor out an x here.

00:04:25.800 --> 00:04:28.795
So let me factor out an x,

00:04:28.795 --> 00:04:30.967
and I get x times

00:04:30.967 --> 00:04:34.847
a plus b.

00:04:34.847 --> 00:04:39.220
A plus b is going to

00:04:39.220 --> 00:04:43.563
be equal to eight plus five-a.

00:04:43.563 --> 00:04:45.118
Eight plus five-a.

00:04:45.118 --> 00:04:46.691
And we're in the home stretch now.

00:04:46.691 --> 00:04:50.902
We can just divide both sides by a plus b.

00:04:50.902 --> 00:04:54.962
So we could divide both sides by a plus b.

00:04:54.962 --> 00:04:56.958
A plus b.

00:04:56.958 --> 00:04:57.934
And we're going to be left with,

00:04:57.934 --> 00:05:00.241
x is equal to

00:05:01.161 --> 00:05:03.738
eight plus five-a,

00:05:03.738 --> 00:05:07.486
plus five-a, over...

00:05:09.276 --> 00:05:12.294
Actually, I'll write a and
b in our original colors.

00:05:12.294 --> 00:05:16.709
A plus, so this was that a, that a,

00:05:16.709 --> 00:05:18.459
plus b.

00:05:18.459 --> 00:05:22.556
So this is the b, that's a and b,

00:05:22.556 --> 00:05:24.375
a plus b, and we're done.

00:05:24.375 --> 00:05:25.738
We have now solved for x

00:05:25.738 --> 00:05:30.579
in terms of a's and b's and other things.

00:05:30.579 --> 00:05:33.196
And we are all done.
