00:00:12.960 --> 00:00:14.656
Hank Willis Thomas: I'm Deb's son.

00:00:14.680 --> 00:00:16.256
(Laughter)

00:00:16.280 --> 00:00:18.896
Deborah Willis: And I'm Hank's mom.

00:00:18.920 --> 00:00:20.856
HWT: We've said that so many times,

00:00:20.880 --> 00:00:22.616
we've made a piece about it.

00:00:22.640 --> 00:00:25.296
It's called "Sometimes
I See Myself In You,"

00:00:25.320 --> 00:00:27.576
and it speaks to
the symbiotic relationship

00:00:27.600 --> 00:00:30.536
that we've developed over the years
through our life and work.

00:00:30.560 --> 00:00:33.696
And really, it's because everywhere we go,

00:00:33.720 --> 00:00:35.016
together or apart,

00:00:35.040 --> 00:00:36.280
we carry these monikers.

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:39.096
I've been following
in my mother's footsteps

00:00:39.120 --> 00:00:40.696
since before I was even born

00:00:40.720 --> 00:00:42.800
and haven't figured out how to stop.

00:00:43.600 --> 00:00:45.920
And as I get older, it does get harder.

00:00:46.680 --> 00:00:48.936
No seriously, it gets harder.

00:00:48.960 --> 00:00:50.496
(Laughter)

00:00:50.520 --> 00:00:52.896
My mother's taught me many things, though,

00:00:52.920 --> 00:00:55.016
most of all that love overrules.

00:00:55.040 --> 00:00:57.216
She's taught me that love

00:00:57.240 --> 00:00:59.440
is an action,

00:01:00.240 --> 00:01:01.536
not a feeling.

00:01:01.560 --> 00:01:05.016
Love is a way of being,
it's a way of doing,

00:01:05.040 --> 00:01:08.240
it's a way of listening
and it's a way of seeing.

00:01:09.320 --> 00:01:11.696
DW: And also, the idea about love,

00:01:11.720 --> 00:01:13.240
photographers,

00:01:14.360 --> 00:01:17.056
they're looking for love
when they make photographs.

00:01:17.080 --> 00:01:19.856
They're looking and looking
and finding love.

00:01:19.880 --> 00:01:21.496
Growing up in North Philadelphia,

00:01:21.520 --> 00:01:25.376
I was surrounded by people
in my family and friends

00:01:25.400 --> 00:01:26.936
who made photographs

00:01:26.960 --> 00:01:30.936
and used the family camera
as a way of telling a story about life,

00:01:30.960 --> 00:01:32.536
about life of joy,

00:01:32.560 --> 00:01:37.296
about what it meant
to become a family in North Philadelphia.

00:01:37.320 --> 00:01:40.376
So I spent most of my life
searching for pictures

00:01:40.400 --> 00:01:43.816
that reflect on ideas
about black love, black joy

00:01:43.840 --> 00:01:45.416
and about family life.

00:01:45.440 --> 00:01:51.320
So it's really important to think about
the action of love overrules as a verb.

00:01:52.120 --> 00:01:56.456
HWT: Sometimes I wonder
if the love of looking is genetic,

00:01:56.480 --> 00:01:58.896
because, like my mother,

00:01:58.920 --> 00:02:02.216
I've loved photographs
since before I can even remember.

00:02:02.240 --> 00:02:06.016
I think sometimes that --
after my mother and her mother --

00:02:06.040 --> 00:02:09.496
that photography and photographs
were my first love.

00:02:09.520 --> 00:02:11.296
No offense to my father,

00:02:11.320 --> 00:02:14.016
but that's what you get
for calling me a "ham"

00:02:14.040 --> 00:02:15.696
wherever you go.

00:02:15.720 --> 00:02:18.197
I remember whenever I'd go
to my grandmother's house,

00:02:18.221 --> 00:02:19.896
she would hide all the photo albums

00:02:19.920 --> 00:02:22.175
because she was afraid of me asking,

00:02:22.199 --> 00:02:23.936
"Well, who is that in that picture?"

00:02:23.960 --> 00:02:26.216
and "Who are they to you
and who are they to me,

00:02:26.240 --> 00:02:28.576
and how old were you
when that picture was taken?

00:02:28.600 --> 00:02:30.656
How old was I when that picture was taken?

00:02:30.680 --> 00:02:32.496
And why were they in black and white?

00:02:32.520 --> 00:02:34.949
Was the world in black and white
before I was born?"

00:02:34.973 --> 00:02:36.376
DW: Well, that's interesting,

00:02:36.400 --> 00:02:38.736
just to think about the world
in black and white.

00:02:38.760 --> 00:02:41.096
I grew up in a beauty shop
in North Philadelphia,

00:02:41.120 --> 00:02:43.496
my mom's beauty shop,
looking at "Ebony Magazine,"

00:02:43.520 --> 00:02:48.456
found images that told stories
that were often not in the daily news,

00:02:48.480 --> 00:02:50.056
but in the family album.

00:02:50.080 --> 00:02:53.056
I wanted the family album
to be energetic for me,

00:02:53.080 --> 00:02:54.736
a way of telling stories,

00:02:54.760 --> 00:02:58.616
and one day I happened upon a book
in the Philadelphia Public Library

00:02:58.640 --> 00:03:03.016
called "The Sweet Flypaper of Life"
by Roy DeCarava and Langston Hughes.

00:03:03.040 --> 00:03:05.216
I think what attracted me
as a seven-year-old,

00:03:05.240 --> 00:03:08.176
the title, flypaper and sweet,

00:03:08.200 --> 00:03:10.296
but to think about that
as a seven-year-old,

00:03:10.320 --> 00:03:13.696
I looked at the beautiful images
that Roy DeCarava made

00:03:13.720 --> 00:03:17.376
and then looked at ways
that I could tell a story about life.

00:03:17.400 --> 00:03:21.520
And looking for me is the act
that basically changed my life.

00:03:21.920 --> 00:03:25.496
HWT: My friend Chris Johnson
told me that every photographer,

00:03:25.520 --> 00:03:29.736
every artist, is essentially
trying to answer one question,

00:03:29.760 --> 00:03:32.016
and I think your question might have been,

00:03:32.040 --> 00:03:35.376
"Why doesn't the rest of the world
see how beautiful we are,

00:03:35.400 --> 00:03:39.296
and what can I do to help them
see our community the way I do?"

00:03:39.320 --> 00:03:41.016
DW: While studying in art school --

00:03:41.040 --> 00:03:42.456
it's probably true --

00:03:42.480 --> 00:03:46.400
I had a male professor who told me
that I was taking up a good man's space.

00:03:47.120 --> 00:03:50.496
He tried to stifle my dream
of becoming a photographer.

00:03:50.520 --> 00:03:54.336
He attempted to shame me
in a class full of male photographers.

00:03:54.360 --> 00:03:58.256
He told me I was out of place
and out of order as a woman,

00:03:58.280 --> 00:04:01.256
and he went on to say
that all you could and would do

00:04:01.280 --> 00:04:05.576
was to have a baby when a good man
could have had your seat in this class.

00:04:05.600 --> 00:04:09.176
I was shocked into silence
into that experience.

00:04:09.200 --> 00:04:12.016
But I had my camera,
and I was determined to prove to him

00:04:12.040 --> 00:04:14.536
that I was worthy
for a seat in that class.

00:04:14.560 --> 00:04:18.056
But in retrospect, I asked myself:
"Why did I need to prove it to him?"

00:04:18.080 --> 00:04:21.416
You know, I had my camera,
and I knew I needed to prove to myself

00:04:21.440 --> 00:04:23.616
that I would make
a difference in photography.

00:04:23.640 --> 00:04:27.040
I love photography, and no one
is going to stop me from making images.

00:04:27.760 --> 00:04:29.255
HWT: But that's when I came in.

00:04:29.279 --> 00:04:32.216
DW: Yeah, that year I graduated,
I got pregnant.

00:04:32.240 --> 00:04:33.680
Yep, he was right.

00:04:34.600 --> 00:04:35.816
And I had you,

00:04:35.840 --> 00:04:40.776
and I shook off that sexist language
that he used against me

00:04:40.800 --> 00:04:43.776
and picked up my camera
and made photographs daily,

00:04:43.800 --> 00:04:48.456
and made photographs of my pregnant belly
as I prepared for graduate school.

00:04:48.480 --> 00:04:52.416
But I thought about also
that black photographers were missing

00:04:52.440 --> 00:04:55.496
from the history books of photography,

00:04:55.520 --> 00:04:58.456
and I was looking
for ways to tell a story.

00:04:58.480 --> 00:05:03.096
And I ran across Gordon Parks' book
"A Choice of Weapons,"

00:05:03.120 --> 00:05:04.816
which was his autobiography.

00:05:04.840 --> 00:05:07.376
I began photographing and making images,

00:05:07.400 --> 00:05:11.696
and I tucked away that contact sheet
that I made of my pregnant belly,

00:05:11.720 --> 00:05:14.296
and then you inspired me
to create a new piece,

00:05:14.320 --> 00:05:18.616
a piece that said, "A woman
taking a place from a good man,"

00:05:18.640 --> 00:05:20.456
"You took the space from a good man,"

00:05:20.480 --> 00:05:24.056
and then I used that language
and reversed it and said,

00:05:24.080 --> 00:05:26.896
"I made a space for a good man, you."

00:05:26.920 --> 00:05:28.136
(Applause)

00:05:28.160 --> 00:05:29.440
HWT: Thanks, ma.

00:05:33.040 --> 00:05:35.216
Like mother, like son.

00:05:35.240 --> 00:05:38.816
I grew up in a house full of photographs.

00:05:38.840 --> 00:05:42.856
They were everywhere, and my mother
would turn the kitchen into a darkroom.

00:05:42.880 --> 00:05:45.016
And there weren't
just pictures that she took

00:05:45.040 --> 00:05:46.576
and pictures of family members.

00:05:46.600 --> 00:05:51.176
But there were pictures on the wall
of and by people that we didn't know,

00:05:51.200 --> 00:05:53.216
men and women that we didn't know.

00:05:53.240 --> 00:05:54.456
Thanks, ma.

00:05:54.480 --> 00:05:55.696
(Laughter)

00:05:55.720 --> 00:05:56.936
I have my own timing.

00:05:56.960 --> 00:05:58.616
(Laughter)

00:05:58.640 --> 00:05:59.856
Did you see her poke me?

00:05:59.880 --> 00:06:01.096
(Laughter)

00:06:01.120 --> 00:06:02.320
Puppet strings.

00:06:06.000 --> 00:06:08.296
I grew up in a house full of photographs.

00:06:08.320 --> 00:06:11.536
(Applause)

00:06:11.560 --> 00:06:14.456
But they weren't just pictures
of men and women that we knew,

00:06:14.480 --> 00:06:17.616
but pictures of people that I didn't know,

00:06:17.640 --> 00:06:20.616
Pretty much, it was pretty clear
from what I learned in school,

00:06:20.640 --> 00:06:23.136
that the rest of the world didn't either.

00:06:23.160 --> 00:06:26.616
And it took me a long time
to figure out what she was up to,

00:06:26.640 --> 00:06:30.256
but after a while, I figured it out.

00:06:30.280 --> 00:06:32.696
When I was nine years old,
she published this book,

00:06:32.720 --> 00:06:36.616
"Black Photographers, 1840-1940:
A Bio-Bibliography."

00:06:36.640 --> 00:06:39.016
And it's astounding to me to consider

00:06:39.040 --> 00:06:43.256
that in 1840, African Americans
were making photographs.

00:06:43.280 --> 00:06:44.896
What does it mean for us to think

00:06:44.920 --> 00:06:49.576
that at a time that was two, three decades
before the end of slavery,

00:06:49.600 --> 00:06:52.776
that people were learning how to read,

00:06:52.800 --> 00:06:54.416
they had to learn how to do math,

00:06:54.440 --> 00:06:57.336
they had to be on the cutting edge
of science and technology,

00:06:57.360 --> 00:07:02.136
to do math, physics and chemistry
just to make a single photograph.

00:07:02.160 --> 00:07:04.720
And what compelled them
to do that if not love?

00:07:05.200 --> 00:07:10.256
Well, that book led her to her next book,
"Black Photographers, 1940-1988,"

00:07:10.280 --> 00:07:14.976
and that book led to another book,
and another book, and another book,

00:07:15.000 --> 00:07:17.256
and another book, and another book,

00:07:17.280 --> 00:07:18.976
and another book, and another book,

00:07:19.000 --> 00:07:22.336
and another book, and another book,
and another book, and another book,

00:07:22.360 --> 00:07:25.696
and another book, and another book,
and another book, and another book,

00:07:25.720 --> 00:07:27.976
and another book,
and another book, and another.

00:07:28.000 --> 00:07:29.736
(Applause)

00:07:29.760 --> 00:07:31.096
And throughout my life,

00:07:31.120 --> 00:07:34.656
she's edited and published dozens of books

00:07:34.680 --> 00:07:39.376
and curated numerous exhibitions
on every continent,

00:07:39.400 --> 00:07:42.936
not all about black photographers
but all inspired by the curiosity

00:07:42.960 --> 00:07:45.496
of a little black girl
from North Philadelphia.

00:07:45.520 --> 00:07:48.936
DW: What I found is that
black photographers had stories to tell,

00:07:48.960 --> 00:07:51.096
and we needed to listen.

00:07:51.120 --> 00:07:52.736
And then I found and I discovered

00:07:52.760 --> 00:07:55.696
black photographers
like Augustus Washington,

00:07:55.720 --> 00:07:57.936
who made these beautiful daguerreotypes

00:07:57.960 --> 00:08:01.976
of the McGill family
in the early 1840s and '50s.

00:08:02.000 --> 00:08:04.936
Their stories tended to be different,
black photographers,

00:08:04.960 --> 00:08:08.936
and they had a different narrative
about black life during slavery,

00:08:08.960 --> 00:08:13.616
but it was also about family life, beauty
and telling stories about community.

00:08:13.640 --> 00:08:16.256
I didn't know how to link the stories,

00:08:16.280 --> 00:08:19.400
but I knew that teachers
needed to know this story.

00:08:19.800 --> 00:08:24.256
HWT: So I think I was
my mother's first student.

00:08:24.280 --> 00:08:27.856
Unwillingly and unwittingly --
puppet strings --

00:08:27.880 --> 00:08:30.416
I decided to pick up a camera,

00:08:30.440 --> 00:08:32.616
and thought that I
should make my own pictures

00:08:32.640 --> 00:08:35.016
about the then and now
and the now and then.

00:08:35.040 --> 00:08:38.416
I thought about
how I could use photography

00:08:38.440 --> 00:08:41.776
to talk about how what's going on
outside of the frame of the camera

00:08:41.800 --> 00:08:43.976
can affect what we see inside.

00:08:44.000 --> 00:08:47.296
The truth is always in the hands
of the actual image maker

00:08:47.320 --> 00:08:50.376
and it's up to us to really consider
what's being cut out.

00:08:50.400 --> 00:08:53.296
I thought I could use her research
as a jumping-off point

00:08:53.320 --> 00:08:55.296
of things that I was seeing in society

00:08:55.320 --> 00:08:58.816
and I wanted to start to think
about how I could use historical images

00:08:58.840 --> 00:09:01.856
to talk about the past being present

00:09:01.880 --> 00:09:03.736
and think about ways that we can speak

00:09:03.760 --> 00:09:07.456
to the perennial struggle
for human rights and equal rights

00:09:07.480 --> 00:09:11.096
through my appropriation of photographs

00:09:11.120 --> 00:09:14.496
in the form of sculpture, video,

00:09:14.520 --> 00:09:15.856
installation and paintings.

00:09:15.880 --> 00:09:20.216
But through it all,
one piece has affected me the most.

00:09:20.240 --> 00:09:21.896
It continues to nourish me.

00:09:21.920 --> 00:09:24.376
It's based off of this photograph
by Ernest Withers,

00:09:24.400 --> 00:09:26.816
who took this picture in 1968

00:09:26.840 --> 00:09:29.216
at the Memphis Sanitation Workers March

00:09:29.240 --> 00:09:33.896
of men and women standing collectively
to affirm their humanity.

00:09:33.920 --> 00:09:36.456
They were holding signs
that said "I am a man,"

00:09:36.480 --> 00:09:39.416
and I found that astounding,
because the phrase I grew up with

00:09:39.440 --> 00:09:42.536
wasn't "I am a man,"
it was "I am the man,"

00:09:42.560 --> 00:09:46.736
and I was amazed at how it went from this
collective statement during segregation

00:09:46.760 --> 00:09:50.456
to this seemingly selfish statement
after integration.

00:09:50.480 --> 00:09:52.456
And I wanted to ponder that,

00:09:52.480 --> 00:09:55.696
so I decided to remix that text
in as many ways as I could think of,

00:09:55.720 --> 00:10:00.816
and I like to think of the top line
as a timeline of American history,

00:10:00.840 --> 00:10:03.096
and the last line as a poem,

00:10:03.120 --> 00:10:04.376
and it says,

00:10:04.400 --> 00:10:07.216
"I am the man. Who's the man.
You the man. What a man.

00:10:07.240 --> 00:10:10.016
I am man. I am many. I am, am I.

00:10:10.040 --> 00:10:12.936
I am, I am. I am, Amen.

00:10:12.960 --> 00:10:14.936
DW: Wow, so fascinating.

00:10:14.960 --> 00:10:16.176
(Applause)

00:10:16.200 --> 00:10:18.056
But what we learn from this experience

00:10:18.080 --> 00:10:21.936
is the most powerful two words
in the English language is, "I am."

00:10:21.960 --> 00:10:24.576
And we each have the capacity to love.

00:10:24.600 --> 00:10:25.816
Thank you.

00:10:25.840 --> 00:10:30.200
(Applause)
