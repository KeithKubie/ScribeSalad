00:00:00.240 --> 00:00:03.665
The least common denominator here is 12.

00:00:03.665 --> 00:00:09.780
1/4 is equivalent to 3/12, and
1/3 is equivalent to 4/12.

00:00:09.780 --> 00:00:13.930
Remember, we add the numerators together
and keep the denominator the same.

00:00:15.310 --> 00:00:18.354
So that leaves us with 7/12.
