00:00:07.140 --> 00:00:11.040
Since the beginning of cinema, female characters
have been evolving and diversifying to include

00:00:11.040 --> 00:00:14.320
a wide range of roles for actresses in current
day Hollywood.

00:00:14.320 --> 00:00:17.520
Although there is still a disparity between
the number of leading roles offered to men

00:00:17.520 --> 00:00:22.590
and women, the past 40 years have introduced
viewers to a number of fantastic heroines.

00:00:22.590 --> 00:00:26.410
Whether they're battling robots or aliens,
leading a rebel resistance, or succeeding

00:00:26.410 --> 00:00:30.230
where their male counterparts have failed,
no one would dare call these female characters

00:00:30.230 --> 00:00:32.020
damsels in distress.

00:00:32.020 --> 00:00:37.870
Here are Screen Rant's 10 badass female characters
in popular movies.

00:00:37.870 --> 00:00:40.239
Ellen Ripley

00:00:40.239 --> 00:00:44.430
One of the most iconic badass women in film
is Sigourney Weaver's cat-loving heroine from

00:00:44.430 --> 00:00:46.769
Ridley Scott's Alien franchise.

00:00:46.769 --> 00:00:51.010
The role was originally conceived with a male
hero in mind, but Scott decided to cast a

00:00:51.010 --> 00:00:53.250
woman in an effort to flip convention.

00:00:53.250 --> 00:00:56.929
The resulting movie gave fans a heroine who
would be the final crew member of the Nostromo

00:00:56.929 --> 00:00:59.750
left standing against the xenomorph.

00:00:59.750 --> 00:01:03.760
Ripley would go on to be the hero of Aliens
as well and cement her spot in the badass

00:01:03.760 --> 00:01:06.800
female movie character hall of fame.

00:01:06.800 --> 00:01:10.100
Katniss Everdeen

00:01:10.100 --> 00:01:13.970
The archer from District 12 first earned the
love of viewers when she sacrificed herself

00:01:13.970 --> 00:01:20.369
as a tribute to Panem's annual death match
in order to save her younger sister.

00:01:20.369 --> 00:01:24.650
But, after defying the odds and winning in
The Hunger Games, Jennifer Lawrence's character

00:01:24.650 --> 00:01:28.540
went on to be the face of a rebellion as the
Mockingjay and lead the districts against

00:01:28.540 --> 00:01:30.710
the dictator President Snow.

00:01:30.710 --> 00:01:34.810
Though Katniss has her moments of vulnerability,
they only help to make her a more badass character

00:01:34.810 --> 00:01:38.610
when she stands up and does the right thing
for Panem.

00:01:38.610 --> 00:01:41.229
The Bride

00:01:41.229 --> 00:01:45.469
Not every badass female character has the
most noble intentions, though it's debatable

00:01:45.469 --> 00:01:49.340
whether the assassin seeking revenge against
former colleagues in Quentin Tarantino's Kill

00:01:49.340 --> 00:01:52.039
Bill is noble or not.

00:01:52.039 --> 00:01:55.870
After The Bride's groom and entire wedding
party are murdered by her ex-lover, Bill,

00:01:55.870 --> 00:01:59.939
she goes on a mission of vengeance until everyone
responsible is dead.

00:01:59.939 --> 00:02:06.159
Described as "the deadliest woman in the world,"
Uma Thurman's character certainly earns the

00:02:06.159 --> 00:02:11.700
title as she slices through the Deadly Vipers
with ruthless drive.

00:02:11.700 --> 00:02:14.060
Sarah Connor

00:02:14.060 --> 00:02:17.590
After playing the waitress in distress when
a Terminator cyborg from the future comes

00:02:17.590 --> 00:02:19.959
calling, Linda Hamilton returned for the sequel
to John Cameron's sci-fi action thriller as

00:02:19.959 --> 00:02:21.870
a veritable badass.

00:02:21.870 --> 00:02:25.620
Using what she learned from Kyle Reese, and
other skills she picked up along the way,

00:02:25.620 --> 00:02:29.310
Sarah Connor is as instrumental to protecting
her son John in Terminator 2: Judgement Day

00:02:29.310 --> 00:02:32.459
as the T-800 sent by his future self.

00:02:32.459 --> 00:02:38.510
Plus, Sarah is the future leader of the Resistance
against Skynet - though it isn't shown in

00:02:38.510 --> 00:02:43.819
the film, it's easy to see the waitress-turned-badass
as a rebel leader.

00:02:43.819 --> 00:02:46.920

00:02:46.920 --> 00:02:48.700
