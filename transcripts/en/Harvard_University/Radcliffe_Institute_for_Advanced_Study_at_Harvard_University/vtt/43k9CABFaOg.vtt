00:00:06.720 --> 00:00:08.010
-Hi, welcome.

00:00:08.010 --> 00:00:09.710
I'm John Huth.

00:00:09.710 --> 00:00:13.170
I'm with the Physics Department
and also the Radcliffe

00:00:13.170 --> 00:00:15.660
Institute for Advanced Study.

00:00:15.660 --> 00:00:19.130
So let me just say a few
words about Radcliffe.

00:00:19.130 --> 00:00:22.250
We have multiple programs here.

00:00:22.250 --> 00:00:27.490
And its mission is explicitly
to be cross-disciplinary,

00:00:27.490 --> 00:00:30.510
multidisciplinary,
which distinguishes it

00:00:30.510 --> 00:00:32.900
from other institutes
for advanced study.

00:00:32.900 --> 00:00:37.940
And to be engaged
in this institution

00:00:37.940 --> 00:00:42.290
has been just amazing
for me because I've

00:00:42.290 --> 00:00:44.890
learned all sorts of
things that I wouldn't

00:00:44.890 --> 00:00:46.680
thought I would have learned.

00:00:46.680 --> 00:00:48.930
I'm a particle
physicist by trade

00:00:48.930 --> 00:00:53.200
and I get into all sorts
of topics like the oceans,

00:00:53.200 --> 00:00:55.090
for example.

00:00:55.090 --> 00:00:58.420
We have many programs that
includes a fellowship program,

00:00:58.420 --> 00:01:03.600
where people can come and spend
a year here with scientists,

00:01:03.600 --> 00:01:08.200
playwrights, people in
the humanities, artists.

00:01:08.200 --> 00:01:12.420
There's a Schlesinger
Library and it's

00:01:12.420 --> 00:01:15.960
dedicated to the history
of women in America.

00:01:15.960 --> 00:01:17.960
I'm a member of the
Ventures faculty, which

00:01:17.960 --> 00:01:22.510
runs our number of programs,
including exploratory seminars,

00:01:22.510 --> 00:01:25.740
which are meant to be
interdisciplinary, workshops

00:01:25.740 --> 00:01:28.270
and science symposium.

00:01:28.270 --> 00:01:31.150
This coming year our
science symposium

00:01:31.150 --> 00:01:34.590
is on the oceans, looking
at various aspects

00:01:34.590 --> 00:01:39.480
various aspects of oceans like
the early life in the oceans,

00:01:39.480 --> 00:01:43.960
where it came from, life in
hydrothermal vents for example,

00:01:43.960 --> 00:01:49.060
and also the outsized role that
oceans play in our climate.

00:01:49.060 --> 00:01:52.850
We also will be having
a series of lectures.

00:01:52.850 --> 00:01:56.160
The ocean's symposium
is on October 28.

00:01:56.160 --> 00:01:59.250
Our kickoff lecture
is Monday October 24

00:01:59.250 --> 00:02:04.620
by Kerry Emanuel, who is a
climatologist, meteorologist

00:02:04.620 --> 00:02:09.520
expert from MIT, who came up
with the concept of hyper cane

00:02:09.520 --> 00:02:13.550
which is a hurricane that
will occur if the sea

00:02:13.550 --> 00:02:16.890
temperatures rise
about 15 degrees C,

00:02:16.890 --> 00:02:20.810
and has predicted that
with the warming oceans

00:02:20.810 --> 00:02:23.030
the frequency of
hurricanes will decrease

00:02:23.030 --> 00:02:26.050
but their intensity will
increase tremendously.

00:02:26.050 --> 00:02:29.630
So that's on October 24.

00:02:29.630 --> 00:02:32.380
What we have here
is our kickoff event

00:02:32.380 --> 00:02:36.320
of a series that is
called Next In Science.

00:02:36.320 --> 00:02:39.560
And the idea is that we're
going to bring early career

00:02:39.560 --> 00:02:45.200
scientists to talk about their
work to a general audience.

00:02:45.200 --> 00:02:49.480
And I guess this is
in part motivated

00:02:49.480 --> 00:02:53.160
by what I've observed that a lot
of the interesting new science

00:02:53.160 --> 00:02:57.140
is happening at the intersection
between disciplines,

00:02:57.140 --> 00:02:58.030
always has.

00:02:58.030 --> 00:03:00.790
And often times the
way universities

00:03:00.790 --> 00:03:03.970
are set up with
departments, the departments

00:03:03.970 --> 00:03:05.850
can sometimes be
somewhat stovepiped

00:03:05.850 --> 00:03:08.050
and miss opportunities.

00:03:08.050 --> 00:03:11.110
And in fact, a lot
of young scientists

00:03:11.110 --> 00:03:13.970
tend to gravitate
to work that tends

00:03:13.970 --> 00:03:16.170
to be at the boundaries
of disciplines.

00:03:16.170 --> 00:03:21.250
And so in a way by exposing
Harvard and the public

00:03:21.250 --> 00:03:24.640
to their work, we are
trying to educate ourselves

00:03:24.640 --> 00:03:29.120
about new areas, emerging
areas in the sciences

00:03:29.120 --> 00:03:31.490
in addition to
getting some exposure

00:03:31.490 --> 00:03:33.470
to the young scientists.

00:03:33.470 --> 00:03:36.890
Just as an example,
in my own discipline,

00:03:36.890 --> 00:03:39.980
particle physics, which
is I would say rather

00:03:39.980 --> 00:03:45.320
mature at this point, it
had its start in study--

00:03:45.320 --> 00:03:48.900
well one of the starts in
experimental particle physics

00:03:48.900 --> 00:03:50.680
was in the study of clouds.

00:03:50.680 --> 00:03:53.420
There are various theories
about how clouds formed.

00:03:53.420 --> 00:03:55.660
One of them was accretion
around dust particles.

00:03:55.660 --> 00:03:58.530
Another was around charged
particles in the atmosphere.

00:03:58.530 --> 00:04:01.530
And cloud chambers
were invented basically

00:04:01.530 --> 00:04:02.940
to try to make clouds.

00:04:02.940 --> 00:04:06.850
And as an accidental
result, people

00:04:06.850 --> 00:04:09.010
were able to find charged
particles using clouds.

00:04:09.010 --> 00:04:12.740
And so there you have sort
of a funny, accidental,

00:04:12.740 --> 00:04:17.060
cross-disciplinary work
that absolutely innovated

00:04:17.060 --> 00:04:19.110
the field of particle physics.

00:04:19.110 --> 00:04:22.970
So as I said, we focus on
early career scientists

00:04:22.970 --> 00:04:24.930
and we try to have a theme.

00:04:24.930 --> 00:04:28.180
Keeping in the theme
with the oceans,

00:04:28.180 --> 00:04:33.050
we decided to gather together
four outstanding scientists,

00:04:33.050 --> 00:04:36.130
early career scientists, to talk
about their work in the oceans.

00:04:36.130 --> 00:04:38.610
And since I helped
organize this I

00:04:38.610 --> 00:04:42.117
had I guess the privilege
of picking the topics

00:04:42.117 --> 00:04:44.200
that I found the most
interesting and the speakers

00:04:44.200 --> 00:04:46.099
that I found the
most interesting.

00:04:46.099 --> 00:04:47.640
Even though you
might not realize it,

00:04:47.640 --> 00:04:52.010
we did a little homework
before we asked you to come.

00:04:52.010 --> 00:04:56.830
So, the format is, we'll have to
approximately 30 minute talks.

00:04:56.830 --> 00:04:58.300
Hold your questions for them.

00:04:58.300 --> 00:05:02.730
We'll then go to questions from
the audience, take a break,

00:05:02.730 --> 00:05:05.950
and then come back
for two more talks.

00:05:05.950 --> 00:05:09.210
And I think they'll
be fascinating,

00:05:09.210 --> 00:05:12.840
at least I'm going to be on
the edge of my seat listening.

00:05:12.840 --> 00:05:17.660
So the first speaker today
is Dr. Rachel Gittman,

00:05:17.660 --> 00:05:20.850
who is from the Marine
Science Center at Northeastern

00:05:20.850 --> 00:05:24.640
University and got her doctorate
at the University of North

00:05:24.640 --> 00:05:27.590
Carolina at Chapel
Hill and is going

00:05:27.590 --> 00:05:31.930
to talk on the
subject of shorelines.

00:05:31.930 --> 00:05:35.040
I'll just say some words
about why I get interested

00:05:35.040 --> 00:05:37.920
in these things, but since
I'm not a sea kayaker,

00:05:37.920 --> 00:05:39.600
I spend a lot of
time on the coast

00:05:39.600 --> 00:05:42.240
and I'm always looking
at the dynamics of what's

00:05:42.240 --> 00:05:44.640
happening when shorelines
and why the sands going away

00:05:44.640 --> 00:05:48.760
here and going over
there, and also pondering

00:05:48.760 --> 00:05:52.000
why some large jetty
is cracking apart

00:05:52.000 --> 00:05:54.810
and the sand is all disappearing
behind that jetty which

00:05:54.810 --> 00:05:59.290
was supposed to hold back
the sand from erosion.

00:05:59.290 --> 00:06:04.590
And so Rachel is going
to talk about this topic.

00:06:04.590 --> 00:06:07.630
And the title of her talk
is Living Shorelines: Are We

00:06:07.630 --> 00:06:11.401
Designing Functional Sustainable
and Resilient Coasts.

00:06:11.401 --> 00:06:11.900
Rachel.

00:06:11.900 --> 00:06:12.950
[APPLAUSE]

00:06:17.254 --> 00:06:19.170
-Thank you for that
introduction and thank you

00:06:19.170 --> 00:06:21.000
all for coming today.

00:06:21.000 --> 00:06:23.220
So just a little
background since this

00:06:23.220 --> 00:06:24.690
is kind of a diverse group.

00:06:24.690 --> 00:06:26.050
I'm an ecologist by training.

00:06:26.050 --> 00:06:28.566
I'm going to start kind
of with some ecology

00:06:28.566 --> 00:06:30.690
and because this is an
interdisciplinary talk, kind

00:06:30.690 --> 00:06:35.290
of move into a tiny, tiny
bit of the engineering side

00:06:35.290 --> 00:06:38.830
and then into some
social science.

00:06:38.830 --> 00:06:42.760
So our coastlines are incredibly
diverse, not just in the US,

00:06:42.760 --> 00:06:44.090
but globally.

00:06:44.090 --> 00:06:46.280
They can encompass
your ocean shorelines,

00:06:46.280 --> 00:06:49.730
like your sand beaches,
your rocky shores, and also

00:06:49.730 --> 00:06:53.490
your sheltered coastlines,
like your coastal tidal marshes

00:06:53.490 --> 00:06:55.460
and also mangroves.

00:06:55.460 --> 00:06:58.090
And they're incredibly
valuable systems.

00:06:58.090 --> 00:07:01.680
So they encompass only
about 4% of the actual land

00:07:01.680 --> 00:07:03.870
on the earth, but
they're extremely

00:07:03.870 --> 00:07:07.200
valuable in terms of their goods
and services that they provide.

00:07:07.200 --> 00:07:11.620
So there's been several studies
looking at ecosystem services

00:07:11.620 --> 00:07:13.742
provided by our coastlines.

00:07:13.742 --> 00:07:15.450
And they just come
out disproportionately

00:07:15.450 --> 00:07:20.480
above a lot of our other
terrestrial ecosystems.

00:07:20.480 --> 00:07:23.490
And one of these services
that I think about a lot

00:07:23.490 --> 00:07:27.300
is this service of providing
habitat to marine organisms.

00:07:27.300 --> 00:07:32.260
And so our coastal habitats such
as mangroves, marshes, and also

00:07:32.260 --> 00:07:35.430
our open coast shore alliance,
they really serve as a nursery.

00:07:35.430 --> 00:07:38.230
They serve as a habitat
through all life history

00:07:38.230 --> 00:07:40.810
stages for lots of
marine organisms.

00:07:40.810 --> 00:07:42.460
And most importantly
for people they

00:07:42.460 --> 00:07:45.700
serve as habitat for a lot of
commercially and recreationally

00:07:45.700 --> 00:07:47.320
valuable fish.

00:07:47.320 --> 00:07:50.820
So you might recognize, if
you're from New England, cod.

00:07:50.820 --> 00:07:52.980
Cod actually spend some
of their life history

00:07:52.980 --> 00:07:56.040
in shallow, rocky,
cobble bottom habitats,

00:07:56.040 --> 00:07:58.150
also sea grass habitats.

00:07:58.150 --> 00:08:00.660
This fish is actually really
famous in North Carolina,

00:08:00.660 --> 00:08:03.390
the red drum or red fish
also in the Gulf Coast.

00:08:03.390 --> 00:08:05.400
Spends a lot of its
early life history

00:08:05.400 --> 00:08:07.840
in sea grasses and marshes.

00:08:07.840 --> 00:08:11.180
And these are some juveniles of
speckled trout, Black Sea bass,

00:08:11.180 --> 00:08:14.380
and also snapper that are
often pulled right out

00:08:14.380 --> 00:08:18.602
of some really tidally shallow
salt marshes in North Carolina.

00:08:18.602 --> 00:08:19.810
And then I throw this one in.

00:08:19.810 --> 00:08:21.226
This is actually
in the Galapagos.

00:08:21.226 --> 00:08:23.410
These are Bacalao or grouper.

00:08:23.410 --> 00:08:24.980
They actually, in
their early life

00:08:24.980 --> 00:08:26.970
history stages are
using mangrove habitats

00:08:26.970 --> 00:08:27.870
in the Galapagos.

00:08:27.870 --> 00:08:32.640
So, globally, these habitats,
these near shore habitats,

00:08:32.640 --> 00:08:34.590
are incredibly important
for our fisheries.

00:08:34.590 --> 00:08:35.809
They're highly productive.

00:08:35.809 --> 00:08:38.902
In the US alone,
roughly 75% of all

00:08:38.902 --> 00:08:41.110
of the fishes that are
commercially or recreationally

00:08:41.110 --> 00:08:45.380
harvested depend on estuarine
or these shallow, near shore

00:08:45.380 --> 00:08:49.810
habitats at one or more of
their life history stages.

00:08:49.810 --> 00:08:52.470
So these habitats are
incredibly valuable

00:08:52.470 --> 00:08:54.430
but they're also imperiled.

00:08:54.430 --> 00:08:59.090
So we've seen unprecedented
degradation and loss

00:08:59.090 --> 00:09:01.880
of our vegetated near
coastal habitats.

00:09:01.880 --> 00:09:04.330
From a quarter to
nearly half of these

00:09:04.330 --> 00:09:06.310
habitats globally
have been lost.

00:09:06.310 --> 00:09:07.970
And we've even
seen greater losses

00:09:07.970 --> 00:09:11.250
with some of our reefs, our
shellfish reefs, like oysters

00:09:11.250 --> 00:09:13.120
and also our coral reefs.

00:09:13.120 --> 00:09:15.950
And there's a number of
factors at play here.

00:09:15.950 --> 00:09:19.540
So you'll hear about climate
change in the talks today,

00:09:19.540 --> 00:09:21.799
but you also need
to think about all

00:09:21.799 --> 00:09:23.840
of the other human factors
that are at play here.

00:09:23.840 --> 00:09:26.310
And coastal development is
one that I think about a lot

00:09:26.310 --> 00:09:28.370
because we are right
along the coast.

00:09:28.370 --> 00:09:31.170
And I'd like to put this slide
up because this is actually,

00:09:31.170 --> 00:09:32.070
this is Dubai.

00:09:32.070 --> 00:09:35.450
So not only are they
developing their coastline,

00:09:35.450 --> 00:09:37.560
they're actually
creating coastline

00:09:37.560 --> 00:09:40.650
to then provide
waterfront development.

00:09:40.650 --> 00:09:43.957
So they're dredging up the
sand and building islands

00:09:43.957 --> 00:09:45.790
so that people can have
waterfront property.

00:09:45.790 --> 00:09:49.920
So you can imagine that that
has pretty dire ecological, also

00:09:49.920 --> 00:09:54.650
physical consequences for those
coastlines and those habitats.

00:09:54.650 --> 00:09:57.070
And so we might say,
well, that's Dubai.

00:09:57.070 --> 00:09:58.610
We don't do that
kind of thing here.

00:09:58.610 --> 00:10:00.600
But that's actually not true.

00:10:00.600 --> 00:10:04.680
This is actually a shot I
took flying into Logan on one

00:10:04.680 --> 00:10:06.640
of my trips back up to Boston.

00:10:06.640 --> 00:10:09.170
And you know, it's a pretty
densely populated coastline,

00:10:09.170 --> 00:10:09.669
right?

00:10:09.669 --> 00:10:13.030
So New England's got a lot of
people and we love our coast.

00:10:13.030 --> 00:10:15.200
Everyone loves Cape Cod.

00:10:15.200 --> 00:10:18.630
And these resources
are valued just

00:10:18.630 --> 00:10:20.240
for recreation and tourism.

00:10:20.240 --> 00:10:22.180
But obviously having
this many people

00:10:22.180 --> 00:10:25.450
living along the coastline can
have some real consequences

00:10:25.450 --> 00:10:28.060
for those ecosystems.

00:10:28.060 --> 00:10:31.700
Now in a natural setting
devoid of people,

00:10:31.700 --> 00:10:34.560
there are a fair number
of stressors that occur

00:10:34.560 --> 00:10:36.420
for these coastal ecosystems.

00:10:36.420 --> 00:10:39.790
This is actually a salt
marsh in North Carolina.

00:10:39.790 --> 00:10:41.560
And this is a core sound.

00:10:41.560 --> 00:10:43.010
So it's a pretty large sound.

00:10:43.010 --> 00:10:45.690
It's shallow, but when
you get the wind blowing

00:10:45.690 --> 00:10:48.050
from the right direction,
the fetch is very large

00:10:48.050 --> 00:10:50.690
or the distance across
the sound is fairly large.

00:10:50.690 --> 00:10:52.970
And you'll get a significant
amount of wave energy

00:10:52.970 --> 00:10:55.920
hitting these coastal
habitats these marshes.

00:10:55.920 --> 00:10:59.710
And so they erode over time and
they essentially roll back up

00:10:59.710 --> 00:11:01.330
into the uplands as they erode.

00:11:01.330 --> 00:11:04.870
And so this is a
dynamic, natural process.

00:11:04.870 --> 00:11:06.090
Shorelines erode.

00:11:06.090 --> 00:11:07.420
They move around.

00:11:07.420 --> 00:11:10.890
As John was kind of alluding
to, sand is not static.

00:11:10.890 --> 00:11:12.422
It's not staying in one place.

00:11:12.422 --> 00:11:13.880
And so this is not
really something

00:11:13.880 --> 00:11:15.630
we're concerned
about as scientists,

00:11:15.630 --> 00:11:19.040
that we have erosion
or that this marsh is

00:11:19.040 --> 00:11:20.430
going to flood at high tide.

00:11:20.430 --> 00:11:22.350
These are all natural processes.

00:11:22.350 --> 00:11:27.780
It's really when we have kind of
the loss of these habitats then

00:11:27.780 --> 00:11:31.000
tied to human infrastructure
that people really

00:11:31.000 --> 00:11:32.297
start to worry about it.

00:11:32.297 --> 00:11:34.630
Because these systems are
going to persist through time,

00:11:34.630 --> 00:11:36.720
geologic history has shown us.

00:11:36.720 --> 00:11:37.850
We still have salt marshes.

00:11:37.850 --> 00:11:39.960
We're going to continue
to have salt marshes.

00:11:39.960 --> 00:11:42.780
But it's really when
we as humans, come in

00:11:42.780 --> 00:11:44.670
and we draw a line in
the sand, and we say,

00:11:44.670 --> 00:11:47.050
this is my waterfront property.

00:11:47.050 --> 00:11:49.590
I want it to stay
here for my lifetime

00:11:49.590 --> 00:11:50.840
that we start to see an issue.

00:11:50.840 --> 00:11:52.430
And this is a picture I took.

00:11:52.430 --> 00:11:54.160
This is in Dauphin
Island, Alabama.

00:11:54.160 --> 00:11:57.230
So people have decided that
they want to live right

00:11:57.230 --> 00:12:01.230
on the water, and over time, the
ocean has eroded away the sand

00:12:01.230 --> 00:12:03.290
and their house is going
to fall in the water.

00:12:03.290 --> 00:12:05.145
And this is actually
not inhabited anymore.

00:12:05.145 --> 00:12:07.270
There's caution tape,
they're not allowed to go in.

00:12:07.270 --> 00:12:09.010
And this is up and
down the coast.

00:12:09.010 --> 00:12:10.540
It's not just from
hurricanes, it's

00:12:10.540 --> 00:12:15.190
actually just poor
zoning and poor planning.

00:12:15.190 --> 00:12:17.490
And this is a picture from
New Bern, North Carolina.

00:12:17.490 --> 00:12:18.860
So this is actually last year.

00:12:18.860 --> 00:12:22.830
They had a tremendous amount
of rainfall in the fall.

00:12:22.830 --> 00:12:26.590
And then you also tend to have
these really high, high tides

00:12:26.590 --> 00:12:28.970
or king tides in the fall.

00:12:28.970 --> 00:12:32.790
And so this is just a normal day
where the high tide has come in

00:12:32.790 --> 00:12:35.250
and completely flooded
the downtown area.

00:12:35.250 --> 00:12:37.540
And this is a pretty
regular occurrence now.

00:12:37.540 --> 00:12:38.780
And this happens in Boston.

00:12:38.780 --> 00:12:41.740
It happens in cities
throughout the East Coast.

00:12:41.740 --> 00:12:45.560
So that's why we have to
kind of take a step back

00:12:45.560 --> 00:12:48.430
and say, OK, we're doing
all of this development.

00:12:48.430 --> 00:12:50.880
We want to live along the coast.

00:12:50.880 --> 00:12:52.930
Over a third of the
global population

00:12:52.930 --> 00:12:55.010
lives within 100
kilometers of the coast,

00:12:55.010 --> 00:12:56.940
and people are moving
towards the coasts.

00:12:56.940 --> 00:12:59.580
So these numbers are
going to increase.

00:12:59.580 --> 00:13:03.840
What can we really do or how
can we live along the coast

00:13:03.840 --> 00:13:06.430
and also protect
this infrastructure?

00:13:06.430 --> 00:13:10.850
Well, historically, what we
have done at least, the last,

00:13:10.850 --> 00:13:14.320
I would say 100,
150 years in the US,

00:13:14.320 --> 00:13:16.060
has been to harden
the shoreline.

00:13:16.060 --> 00:13:18.680
So the US Army
Corps of Engineers,

00:13:18.680 --> 00:13:21.450
they have done tremendous
things in our country

00:13:21.450 --> 00:13:24.940
in terms of redirecting
rivers and also

00:13:24.940 --> 00:13:26.110
hardening our shorelines.

00:13:26.110 --> 00:13:28.140
They build these sea walls.

00:13:28.140 --> 00:13:29.830
They'll build
groins and jetties,

00:13:29.830 --> 00:13:32.710
the big shore perpendicular
rock structures

00:13:32.710 --> 00:13:35.220
you often see at inlets.

00:13:35.220 --> 00:13:37.450
The idea is that you'll
engineer your way out

00:13:37.450 --> 00:13:39.670
of this problem of
coastal hazards,

00:13:39.670 --> 00:13:42.329
this problem the erosion,
or this problem of flooding.

00:13:42.329 --> 00:13:44.370
And so that's really what
we've done in the past.

00:13:44.370 --> 00:13:45.732
We built sea walls.

00:13:45.732 --> 00:13:48.640
This is one actually,
at Linshore Drive,

00:13:48.640 --> 00:13:51.350
so up near Swanstat,
if you know that area.

00:13:51.350 --> 00:13:53.360
This is a riprap or revetment.

00:13:53.360 --> 00:13:56.960
So it's just essentially rock
piled up along the shore.

00:13:56.960 --> 00:14:00.400
And then this is actually a
break water, so again rock

00:14:00.400 --> 00:14:03.850
and in this case, it's
actually morrel actually placed

00:14:03.850 --> 00:14:06.050
seaward of a tidal salt marsh.

00:14:06.050 --> 00:14:09.030
And so, I'll actually talk
about these structures

00:14:09.030 --> 00:14:11.910
in the terms of calling them a
living shoreline a little bit

00:14:11.910 --> 00:14:12.800
later in the talk.

00:14:12.800 --> 00:14:15.170
But these are the two
more traditional types

00:14:15.170 --> 00:14:20.180
of hardening that I really
focus on with my work.

00:14:20.180 --> 00:14:24.230
So in starting to think about
this issue, when I was starting

00:14:24.230 --> 00:14:26.350
graduate school I
wanted to do work

00:14:26.350 --> 00:14:29.420
on understanding
the ecology or what

00:14:29.420 --> 00:14:31.800
was happening when you
harden the shoreline

00:14:31.800 --> 00:14:33.232
to these near shore habitats.

00:14:33.232 --> 00:14:34.940
The first question I
really had was well,

00:14:34.940 --> 00:14:36.155
how much does this happen?

00:14:36.155 --> 00:14:37.530
How much hardening
do we actually

00:14:37.530 --> 00:14:39.300
have in the United States?

00:14:39.300 --> 00:14:42.010
I thought this would be an easy
number that I could look up.

00:14:42.010 --> 00:14:44.200
It turns out we had no idea.

00:14:44.200 --> 00:14:46.660
So after scouring
a lot of data sets,

00:14:46.660 --> 00:14:48.080
I actually came
across a NOAA data

00:14:48.080 --> 00:14:51.280
set that was used for oil spill
response where they classified

00:14:51.280 --> 00:14:54.100
different shoreline types, but
they had never actually thought

00:14:54.100 --> 00:14:56.840
to do the math and to actually
figure out how much of this

00:14:56.840 --> 00:14:58.950
was actually
artificial shoreline.

00:14:58.950 --> 00:15:01.290
And so I did that
essentially for them.

00:15:01.290 --> 00:15:03.770
And so what I
found is that well,

00:15:03.770 --> 00:15:07.330
if we just take a
subset of this shoreline

00:15:07.330 --> 00:15:09.070
and you look just
at New England,

00:15:09.070 --> 00:15:12.110
I figured out that about 10% of
the shoreline from Connecticut

00:15:12.110 --> 00:15:14.130
to Maine is hardened.

00:15:14.130 --> 00:15:17.130
And so this is a map
showing the warm colors

00:15:17.130 --> 00:15:19.310
being a higher percentage
of the shoreline that's

00:15:19.310 --> 00:15:21.880
actually hardened relative to
the total amount of shoreline.

00:15:21.880 --> 00:15:23.102
Cool colors being less.

00:15:23.102 --> 00:15:24.560
It shouldn't really
be any surprise

00:15:24.560 --> 00:15:28.640
that the Boston area is
fairly highly hardened.

00:15:28.640 --> 00:15:32.870
And if you look at the US
as a whole, it's roughly 14%

00:15:32.870 --> 00:15:33.800
of the US coastline.

00:15:33.800 --> 00:15:37.960
This is about 22,000 kilometers,
roughly 14,000 miles.

00:15:37.960 --> 00:15:40.390
And I had a colleague actually
say that it's essentially

00:15:40.390 --> 00:15:43.166
like saying, you could
take one in six steps

00:15:43.166 --> 00:15:45.040
and you could encounter
a hardened shoreline,

00:15:45.040 --> 00:15:48.511
which I thought was a kind of
neat way to think about it.

00:15:48.511 --> 00:15:50.930
So 14% might not seem
like a whole lot,

00:15:50.930 --> 00:15:53.850
but when you think about how
much coast we actually have,

00:15:53.850 --> 00:15:55.450
it's a pretty
substantial number.

00:15:55.450 --> 00:15:58.320
And it's likely to increase,
given the number of people

00:15:58.320 --> 00:16:00.770
that are moving to the coasts.

00:16:00.770 --> 00:16:02.630
So I did a series
of analyzes to kind

00:16:02.630 --> 00:16:05.000
of figure out what's most
correlated with shoreline

00:16:05.000 --> 00:16:05.980
hardening.

00:16:05.980 --> 00:16:07.980
And it's no surprise
that you know,

00:16:07.980 --> 00:16:09.719
housing density is
positively correlated

00:16:09.719 --> 00:16:10.760
with shoreline hardening.

00:16:10.760 --> 00:16:13.320
The more people you have,
the more houses you have,

00:16:13.320 --> 00:16:15.260
the more hardening you have.

00:16:15.260 --> 00:16:17.880
So if you look at predictions
for population growth,

00:16:17.880 --> 00:16:20.080
what we see is that really
it's the South Atlantic

00:16:20.080 --> 00:16:22.010
and the Gulf Coast
are predicted to see

00:16:22.010 --> 00:16:24.210
the largest increases
in population

00:16:24.210 --> 00:16:26.100
in the coming decades.

00:16:26.100 --> 00:16:28.814
So we expect these
areas to be probably

00:16:28.814 --> 00:16:30.980
the ones that are going to
get hardened the quickest

00:16:30.980 --> 00:16:33.250
unless coastal management
policies change.

00:16:33.250 --> 00:16:37.045
The Northeast, we have seen
kind of natural rocky shores,

00:16:37.045 --> 00:16:39.420
and a lot of the area has
actually already been developed

00:16:39.420 --> 00:16:40.461
and are already hardened.

00:16:40.461 --> 00:16:44.160
So we're probably reaching some
kind of plateau in hardening.

00:16:44.160 --> 00:16:46.390
But it's these areas that
are relatively undeveloped

00:16:46.390 --> 00:16:49.760
now that we really
need to be focused on.

00:16:49.760 --> 00:16:52.600
So why do we care if we're
hardening the shoreline?

00:16:52.600 --> 00:16:54.189
It's essentially
just a different type

00:16:54.189 --> 00:16:54.980
of shoreline right?

00:16:54.980 --> 00:16:58.200
We're using hard materials.

00:16:58.200 --> 00:17:00.580
What does it do in terms of
providing functional habitat?

00:17:00.580 --> 00:17:04.000
Is it equivalent to having
a marsh shoreline or just

00:17:04.000 --> 00:17:06.800
a natural rocky shoreline?

00:17:06.800 --> 00:17:10.650
Is it equivalent in terms
of providing fish habitat?

00:17:10.650 --> 00:17:12.579
So this is a question
that I really wanted

00:17:12.579 --> 00:17:14.609
to ask kind of the last year.

00:17:14.609 --> 00:17:17.490
And so what I did was I
did a meta-analysis of all

00:17:17.490 --> 00:17:20.640
the peer-reviewed studies on
shoreline hardening in terms

00:17:20.640 --> 00:17:24.220
of measuring the biodiversity
of those shoreline types,

00:17:24.220 --> 00:17:26.859
so the number and
types of organisms,

00:17:26.859 --> 00:17:29.100
and the overall
abundance of organisms

00:17:29.100 --> 00:17:31.770
on hardened shorelines
and then compared them

00:17:31.770 --> 00:17:32.870
to natural shorelines.

00:17:32.870 --> 00:17:35.230
So those are all the
studies that have ever

00:17:35.230 --> 00:17:37.210
been published globally.

00:17:37.210 --> 00:17:40.380
So it's not just US studies
but also a lot of work

00:17:40.380 --> 00:17:42.720
out of Europe and
also Australia.

00:17:42.720 --> 00:17:45.370
And the three types of
shorelines I focused on were

00:17:45.370 --> 00:17:47.350
are the ones that are
most commonly used.

00:17:47.350 --> 00:17:50.000
So sea walls and bulkheads,
these are vertical walls.

00:17:50.000 --> 00:17:52.260
They're made of
concrete, wood, vinyl,

00:17:52.260 --> 00:17:54.520
depends on where you are.

00:17:54.520 --> 00:17:57.310
Riprap or revetment, so it's
some type of rock or concrete

00:17:57.310 --> 00:17:58.950
piled along the shore.

00:17:58.950 --> 00:18:01.180
And then these breakwaters
that can sometimes

00:18:01.180 --> 00:18:04.370
include some kind of
marsh, but sometimes not.

00:18:04.370 --> 00:18:07.180
And so I categorize them
into these three groups

00:18:07.180 --> 00:18:10.110
and then I took all of
the data from the studies

00:18:10.110 --> 00:18:14.420
to determine what the overall
effect was on biodiversity,

00:18:14.420 --> 00:18:17.260
and also just the total
number of organisms

00:18:17.260 --> 00:18:20.620
occupying these habitat.

00:18:20.620 --> 00:18:22.820
And so this is just a
table showing the number

00:18:22.820 --> 00:18:25.040
of studies and the
responses by category

00:18:25.040 --> 00:18:27.430
for biodiversity and abundance.

00:18:27.430 --> 00:18:29.170
And this is just to
give you a visual

00:18:29.170 --> 00:18:31.520
of the types of organisms
we're talking about.

00:18:31.520 --> 00:18:35.140
So I had five different kind
of categories of organisms.

00:18:35.140 --> 00:18:38.730
So flora are these
plants, so effect

00:18:38.730 --> 00:18:42.460
on the actual marsh or sea
grass or mangrove habitat.

00:18:42.460 --> 00:18:46.050
Epibiota is anything that's
growing directly on the shores.

00:18:46.050 --> 00:18:49.640
So you might have or oysters,
ribbed mussels, barnacles,

00:18:49.640 --> 00:18:51.360
tuna kits, anything
that's actually

00:18:51.360 --> 00:18:53.270
attaching to the surface.

00:18:53.270 --> 00:18:57.400
Shore birds, so any kind of
marine or shore-based bird,

00:18:57.400 --> 00:19:01.740
sea gulls, plovers, anything
dependent on shore habitat.

00:19:01.740 --> 00:19:06.340
Nekton is really mobile
fishes and crustations, so

00:19:06.340 --> 00:19:09.116
your decapods, your
crabs also any fish that

00:19:09.116 --> 00:19:10.240
might be using the habitat.

00:19:10.240 --> 00:19:12.020
And then benthic
infauna is a whole suite

00:19:12.020 --> 00:19:14.450
of organisms actually
living in the sediments.

00:19:14.450 --> 00:19:18.185
So it can be bivalves,
gastropods, also polychaetes.

00:19:20.790 --> 00:19:23.660
So I'm going to show
you a series of graphs

00:19:23.660 --> 00:19:27.140
here on biodiversity and
abundance of effects.

00:19:27.140 --> 00:19:29.230
And so all you really
need to understand

00:19:29.230 --> 00:19:31.910
here is that this is a
measure of effect size.

00:19:31.910 --> 00:19:34.730
And the more
negative on this axis

00:19:34.730 --> 00:19:37.770
means the larger
the negative effect

00:19:37.770 --> 00:19:40.510
on biodiversity and
abundance, so the worse it

00:19:40.510 --> 00:19:42.710
is for biodiversity
and abundance.

00:19:42.710 --> 00:19:46.590
And this is for seawalls first,
riprap, and then breakwaters.

00:19:46.590 --> 00:19:48.630
And I'm just going to
highlight seawalls here.

00:19:48.630 --> 00:19:51.060
Because there are
this is the group

00:19:51.060 --> 00:19:54.740
of structures that had a
significant negative effect

00:19:54.740 --> 00:19:56.380
on biodiversity and abundance.

00:19:56.380 --> 00:19:58.790
So across all of
the studies that I

00:19:58.790 --> 00:20:00.940
was able to compile
data from, we

00:20:00.940 --> 00:20:04.950
had a consistent negative
effect of this type of structure

00:20:04.950 --> 00:20:08.060
relative to a natural shoreline
on the overall ecosystem

00:20:08.060 --> 00:20:10.170
biodiversity and abundance.

00:20:10.170 --> 00:20:12.590
And if this kind of
log response ratio

00:20:12.590 --> 00:20:15.840
is not that intuitive to you,
another way to think about it

00:20:15.840 --> 00:20:19.040
is a difference, a percent
difference in the biodiversity

00:20:19.040 --> 00:20:20.040
in abundance.

00:20:20.040 --> 00:20:22.320
And so you're essentially
talking about a little

00:20:22.320 --> 00:20:29.610
over a 25% loss in biodiversity,
and also around a 35% to 40%

00:20:29.610 --> 00:20:30.530
loss in abundance.

00:20:30.530 --> 00:20:32.800
This is biodiversity
and this is abundance

00:20:32.800 --> 00:20:35.840
when you have a sea wall
instead of a natural shoreline

00:20:35.840 --> 00:20:38.470
like a rocky shoreline
or a marsh shoreline.

00:20:38.470 --> 00:20:40.480
The other two structure
types, we did not

00:20:40.480 --> 00:20:41.660
have a significant effect.

00:20:41.660 --> 00:20:44.270
They were not different
from natural shoreline.

00:20:44.270 --> 00:20:48.820
But I will say that this is
actually likely due to there

00:20:48.820 --> 00:20:50.240
being fewer number of studies.

00:20:50.240 --> 00:20:54.290
So we didn't have enough studies
to really definitively say

00:20:54.290 --> 00:20:56.654
whether or not they
are different or not.

00:20:56.654 --> 00:20:58.570
And so I'm hoping we'll
see more work come out

00:20:58.570 --> 00:20:59.440
in the coming years.

00:20:59.440 --> 00:21:02.110
So the jury's still kind
of out on these other types

00:21:02.110 --> 00:21:04.210
of shorelines.

00:21:04.210 --> 00:21:06.900
So just to give you an
idea of who's affected,

00:21:06.900 --> 00:21:09.810
so I mentioned the
benthic infauna.

00:21:09.810 --> 00:21:12.030
And I just list a couple
of examples studies,

00:21:12.030 --> 00:21:14.600
but it's really either
polychaete anthropods and also

00:21:14.600 --> 00:21:18.120
these filter-feeding
bivalves, clams, mussels,

00:21:18.120 --> 00:21:21.760
that kind of thing that
are living in the sediment.

00:21:21.760 --> 00:21:25.010
Shore birds are negatively
affected by sea walls,

00:21:25.010 --> 00:21:28.020
likely because when you
have a seawall in place,

00:21:28.020 --> 00:21:30.620
the beach often goes away
in front of the seawall.

00:21:30.620 --> 00:21:35.470
And these shore birds depend on
that shallow, inner tidal zone,

00:21:35.470 --> 00:21:39.910
that swash zone to feed
on benthic invertebrates.

00:21:39.910 --> 00:21:43.620
And then Nekton or your fish and
crustaceans are also affected.

00:21:43.620 --> 00:21:46.210
And these are largely
organisms that

00:21:46.210 --> 00:21:50.620
are utilizing salt marsh habitat
and also seagrass habitat.

00:21:50.620 --> 00:21:53.740
So when you lose that marsh
habitat or you replace it

00:21:53.740 --> 00:21:56.830
with a bulkhead or a
seawall, you're often

00:21:56.830 --> 00:21:59.810
losing these marsh
residents like mummichogs,

00:21:59.810 --> 00:22:04.070
or the little marsh
killifish, or panaeid shrimp,

00:22:04.070 --> 00:22:07.420
so shrimp that we like to
eat, and also blue crabs

00:22:07.420 --> 00:22:09.660
from the Southeast,
so organisms that

00:22:09.660 --> 00:22:12.420
are very dependent on that
vegetative structured habitat

00:22:12.420 --> 00:22:17.120
tend to suffer when you
bulkhead a shoreline.

00:22:17.120 --> 00:22:21.219
But it's not just that snapshot
biodiversity and abundance

00:22:21.219 --> 00:22:22.010
that we care about.

00:22:22.010 --> 00:22:25.270
We're also concerned about
the long term consequences

00:22:25.270 --> 00:22:27.420
of armoring the shoreline.

00:22:27.420 --> 00:22:29.240
So typically, when
you have a-- this

00:22:29.240 --> 00:22:31.600
is a typical shoreline
for the Southeast

00:22:31.600 --> 00:22:35.130
or maybe for the tidal creeks
and the marshes up in New

00:22:35.130 --> 00:22:38.220
England, you're going to have
a shallow sloping tidal marsh,

00:22:38.220 --> 00:22:41.270
a shallow water refuge, and
then maybe some sea grass

00:22:41.270 --> 00:22:44.730
here, occupied by lots of
juvenile fish and crustaceans,

00:22:44.730 --> 00:22:46.430
shore birds, and whatnot.

00:22:46.430 --> 00:22:48.390
When you put a
bulkhead in place,

00:22:48.390 --> 00:22:49.950
even though it's
permit to actually

00:22:49.950 --> 00:22:53.720
be landward of this
marsh, we're facing things

00:22:53.720 --> 00:22:56.940
like sea level rise
and also just increased

00:22:56.940 --> 00:22:58.760
severity of storm events.

00:22:58.760 --> 00:23:01.070
And so over time,
you essentially

00:23:01.070 --> 00:23:03.610
lose that marsh because
this bulkhead is not

00:23:03.610 --> 00:23:05.160
absorbing energy.

00:23:05.160 --> 00:23:07.450
It's essentially
reflecting it back.

00:23:07.450 --> 00:23:11.160
And so you get a deepening of
that intertidal environment

00:23:11.160 --> 00:23:13.044
through scour of the sediment.

00:23:13.044 --> 00:23:14.960
And engineers have known
this for a long time.

00:23:14.960 --> 00:23:17.550
They actually typically pile
of rock in front of bulkheads

00:23:17.550 --> 00:23:19.760
now to prevent that tow scour.

00:23:19.760 --> 00:23:22.590
So this is not new
knowledge, but it's

00:23:22.590 --> 00:23:25.300
something that's been really
hard to document in terms

00:23:25.300 --> 00:23:29.550
of loss of marsh and sea grass
and other vegetative habitats,

00:23:29.550 --> 00:23:33.090
which is why it's actually
still permitted in the US,

00:23:33.090 --> 00:23:35.940
even though wetlands
are federally protected.

00:23:35.940 --> 00:23:38.210
So this is something that
a lot of colleagues of mine

00:23:38.210 --> 00:23:40.040
are trying to document
now, because it

00:23:40.040 --> 00:23:44.180
happens over decade scales, as
opposed to just the one or two

00:23:44.180 --> 00:23:47.650
years that you typically get
funding for a research project.

00:23:47.650 --> 00:23:50.860
And so right now I think we
have about 10 to 15 years

00:23:50.860 --> 00:23:53.200
worth of data on a
set of shorelines,

00:23:53.200 --> 00:23:55.810
and I'm hoping that we'll
be able to publish something

00:23:55.810 --> 00:23:59.710
in the near future to kind
of document this loss.

00:23:59.710 --> 00:24:02.410
But the really important
part about understanding

00:24:02.410 --> 00:24:05.220
this process is this is
happening below the high water

00:24:05.220 --> 00:24:09.540
line, which is really typically
public trust resources.

00:24:09.540 --> 00:24:14.110
So these are areas that are
owned by the general public,

00:24:14.110 --> 00:24:16.860
and not by the
private property owner

00:24:16.860 --> 00:24:19.700
or developer that's actually
put in that structure.

00:24:19.700 --> 00:24:25.850
So there's a very complicated
private-public ownership issue

00:24:25.850 --> 00:24:26.620
here at stake.

00:24:26.620 --> 00:24:29.320
And that's why the politics
and the policies around crystal

00:24:29.320 --> 00:24:32.710
management can be
fairly complicated.

00:24:32.710 --> 00:24:35.160
So I kind of hold
you the bad side.

00:24:35.160 --> 00:24:37.780
I've told you the negative
effects of shoreline hardening.

00:24:37.780 --> 00:24:39.840
But there are alternatives.

00:24:39.840 --> 00:24:42.740
There are ways that we can
protect private property

00:24:42.740 --> 00:24:47.070
from these coastal hazards
without compromising

00:24:47.070 --> 00:24:47.690
the habitat.

00:24:47.690 --> 00:24:49.820
At least that's what
a lot of the NGOs

00:24:49.820 --> 00:24:53.121
and some of NOAA's
group has been trying

00:24:53.121 --> 00:24:54.620
to do in the last
couple decades has

00:24:54.620 --> 00:24:57.480
developed these types of
structures, these living

00:24:57.480 --> 00:24:59.350
shorelines.

00:24:59.350 --> 00:25:01.407
And really, when I came
into graduate school

00:25:01.407 --> 00:25:02.990
one of the first
things I wanted to do

00:25:02.990 --> 00:25:04.531
was actually test
whether or not they

00:25:04.531 --> 00:25:08.770
were functionally equivalent
to a natural or pristine

00:25:08.770 --> 00:25:09.840
shoreline.

00:25:09.840 --> 00:25:12.110
So this is a NOAA definition
for a living shoreline.

00:25:12.110 --> 00:25:14.490
But really what you
want to take from this

00:25:14.490 --> 00:25:17.620
is that it has to have some
kind of living component.

00:25:17.620 --> 00:25:20.530
There can be a structural
element, an artificial element.

00:25:20.530 --> 00:25:23.750
You can have rocks out,
but you have to have marsh.

00:25:23.750 --> 00:25:25.484
You have to have mangrove.

00:25:25.484 --> 00:25:27.400
You have to have some
kind of living component

00:25:27.400 --> 00:25:30.210
to the shoreline for it
to be considered for NOAA

00:25:30.210 --> 00:25:32.260
and for a lot of the
NOS's supporting this,

00:25:32.260 --> 00:25:34.340
a living shoreline.

00:25:34.340 --> 00:25:37.400
And here are some examples
from North Carolina

00:25:37.400 --> 00:25:39.120
for estaurine shorelines.

00:25:39.120 --> 00:25:41.220
And I should say
for the open coast,

00:25:41.220 --> 00:25:44.000
beach June grass
would be equivalent

00:25:44.000 --> 00:25:47.290
if you wanted to have an
open ocean living shoreline.

00:25:47.290 --> 00:25:49.650
So this is a morel sill
with some marsh behind it.

00:25:49.650 --> 00:25:53.660
This is a granite sill
with marsh on this side.

00:25:53.660 --> 00:25:56.087
And then this is actually
a loose oyster sill

00:25:56.087 --> 00:25:58.170
that we constructed while
I was in graduate school

00:25:58.170 --> 00:26:02.230
along a really eroded shoreline
as part of an Estaurine

00:26:02.230 --> 00:26:03.200
Research Reserve.

00:26:03.200 --> 00:26:06.170
And this over time
accululated live oyster

00:26:06.170 --> 00:26:07.745
and became a living oyster reef.

00:26:10.310 --> 00:26:13.390
So for the work that I was
doing in graduate school,

00:26:13.390 --> 00:26:15.730
I really wanted
to understand, OK,

00:26:15.730 --> 00:26:18.810
we have these sill structures
we want to put out.

00:26:18.810 --> 00:26:20.000
We want to plant marsh.

00:26:20.000 --> 00:26:21.820
We want to create
a living shoreline.

00:26:21.820 --> 00:26:25.840
Is it really truly equivalent
to a natural shoreline?

00:26:25.840 --> 00:26:27.500
And so, this is
kind of my schematic

00:26:27.500 --> 00:26:29.784
of what a natural
estaurine shoreline would

00:26:29.784 --> 00:26:30.950
look like in North Carolina.

00:26:30.950 --> 00:26:32.085
You would have salt marsh.

00:26:32.085 --> 00:26:33.460
You'd have intertidal
oyster reef

00:26:33.460 --> 00:26:35.780
and then you'd have
some sea grass.

00:26:35.780 --> 00:26:37.770
Well, in a lot of places
in North Carolina,

00:26:37.770 --> 00:26:40.510
oysters have been
degraded and largely lost.

00:26:40.510 --> 00:26:42.170
So a lot of these
fringing marshes

00:26:42.170 --> 00:26:46.280
are eroding because they don't
have this natural kind of shore

00:26:46.280 --> 00:26:48.810
protection anymore in
the form of oyster reefs.

00:26:48.810 --> 00:26:52.400
So I decided to compare these
shorelines that are currently

00:26:52.400 --> 00:26:54.260
eroding and might end
up being bulkheaded

00:26:54.260 --> 00:26:56.009
because the private
property owner doesn't

00:26:56.009 --> 00:26:58.450
want their property to
erode, and compare them

00:26:58.450 --> 00:27:01.250
to this newer technique, which
is to put a rock still out

00:27:01.250 --> 00:27:02.430
in front.

00:27:02.430 --> 00:27:04.920
And then also compare it
to the traditional way,

00:27:04.920 --> 00:27:07.020
which would have been
to put a bulkhead up,

00:27:07.020 --> 00:27:09.090
and then the thought
being you would eventually

00:27:09.090 --> 00:27:10.420
lose the marsh over time.

00:27:10.420 --> 00:27:13.090
So I sampled bulkheads
for the marsh,

00:27:13.090 --> 00:27:14.900
had basically
already disappeared.

00:27:14.900 --> 00:27:20.120
I sampled sills with marsh
and then marsh alone.

00:27:20.120 --> 00:27:22.160
And so this first
graph is just showing

00:27:22.160 --> 00:27:24.800
you kind of a snapshot of
some of the work that I did.

00:27:24.800 --> 00:27:26.720
But it's a catch
per unit effort.

00:27:26.720 --> 00:27:29.710
So it's basically the number
of individuals that we caught.

00:27:29.710 --> 00:27:32.440
And the first graph is
just comparing our control,

00:27:32.440 --> 00:27:33.930
which is the salt
marshes that have

00:27:33.930 --> 00:27:38.830
lost that intertidal oysterie
to a marsh with that rock

00:27:38.830 --> 00:27:40.270
sill out in front.

00:27:40.270 --> 00:27:42.670
The black bars are the
number of fish we caught

00:27:42.670 --> 00:27:45.320
and the gray bars are the number
of crustacians that we caught,

00:27:45.320 --> 00:27:47.630
so blue crabs and shrimp.

00:27:47.630 --> 00:27:50.150
And what we see here is
that we actually see,

00:27:50.150 --> 00:27:52.840
not only are we providing
equivalent habitat,

00:27:52.840 --> 00:27:54.480
we're actually
seeing enhancement.

00:27:54.480 --> 00:27:56.510
So we have a higher
abundance and this also

00:27:56.510 --> 00:27:59.110
applies in terms of total
diversity of fishing

00:27:59.110 --> 00:28:02.630
crustaceans occupying these
marshes that have sills

00:28:02.630 --> 00:28:05.410
in front relative
to control marshes.

00:28:05.410 --> 00:28:07.670
And one of the
thoughts might be that

00:28:07.670 --> 00:28:10.220
because these marshes typically
had oyster reef in front

00:28:10.220 --> 00:28:13.000
of them, but that those had
been lost through overharvest

00:28:13.000 --> 00:28:16.260
and erosion, that that rock,
that actually colonizes

00:28:16.260 --> 00:28:18.590
oysters, is serving
as a substitute

00:28:18.590 --> 00:28:19.900
for that natural structure.

00:28:19.900 --> 00:28:23.452
So would obviously not be
the same in other regions

00:28:23.452 --> 00:28:24.910
that don't have
intertidal oysters.

00:28:24.910 --> 00:28:27.243
You would be thinking about
it a little bit differently.

00:28:27.243 --> 00:28:28.980
But here it seems
to be a substitution

00:28:28.980 --> 00:28:30.950
in terms of habitat.

00:28:30.950 --> 00:28:32.470
And in terms of
who's present, we

00:28:32.470 --> 00:28:36.800
have a lot of small kind of
estuarine, marsh-dependent

00:28:36.800 --> 00:28:39.220
species like mummichogs
and killifish.

00:28:39.220 --> 00:28:41.530
But we also start to see
some of the commercially

00:28:41.530 --> 00:28:43.661
and recreationally
valuable species.

00:28:43.661 --> 00:28:46.160
In North Carolina, [? retrome ?]
is extremely recreationally

00:28:46.160 --> 00:28:50.260
valuable, blue crab,
speckled trout, flounder,

00:28:50.260 --> 00:28:53.580
and snapper species, also
some pig fish, all of these

00:28:53.580 --> 00:28:56.180
are species that people
are actively fishing for.

00:28:56.180 --> 00:29:00.650
So it's important not only just
for the ecological function,

00:29:00.650 --> 00:29:02.610
but also for the fisheries,
kind of tying back

00:29:02.610 --> 00:29:07.140
to the original reason we
care about coastal ecosystems.

00:29:07.140 --> 00:29:08.910
Now for the second
part of the study,

00:29:08.910 --> 00:29:11.580
we decided to go ahead and
sample bulkheads as well.

00:29:11.580 --> 00:29:14.010
So these are bulkheads
without any marsh in front.

00:29:14.010 --> 00:29:17.690
Same types of marshes and
then marshes with sills.

00:29:17.690 --> 00:29:19.510
And we did a more
targeted sampling

00:29:19.510 --> 00:29:24.160
to get at these marsh-dependent
organisms, so these killifish,

00:29:24.160 --> 00:29:28.540
these smaller organisms
seem to really need marsh

00:29:28.540 --> 00:29:30.860
for them to want to
be in this habitat.

00:29:30.860 --> 00:29:33.290
And so what we see
is that again we

00:29:33.290 --> 00:29:38.500
see an enhancement, although
not significant, of fish

00:29:38.500 --> 00:29:42.290
when you add the sill in front
of the control marsh, and then

00:29:42.290 --> 00:29:45.820
a definite significant increase
relative to the bulkhead.

00:29:45.820 --> 00:29:49.230
So the bulkhead has
many fewer organisms,

00:29:49.230 --> 00:29:51.490
particularly these
marsh-dependent organisms

00:29:51.490 --> 00:29:54.450
than the sill or
the control marsh.

00:29:54.450 --> 00:29:58.160
And so in the control we tend
to see some general species that

00:29:58.160 --> 00:30:00.030
are using these habitats.

00:30:00.030 --> 00:30:02.040
In the sill we tend
to see some more reef

00:30:02.040 --> 00:30:04.600
or oyster associated
species that are added.

00:30:04.600 --> 00:30:07.300
So this is starting to kind
of get at some explanation

00:30:07.300 --> 00:30:13.725
as to who is really
inhabiting these habitat.

00:30:13.725 --> 00:30:15.100
But when you get
to the bulkhead,

00:30:15.100 --> 00:30:17.820
you actually only have
your generalist species.

00:30:17.820 --> 00:30:20.125
So you essentially have
your marsh residents

00:30:20.125 --> 00:30:22.630
plus generalists,
marsh residents

00:30:22.630 --> 00:30:25.442
plus reef associated
species like sheepshead.

00:30:25.442 --> 00:30:26.900
And then when you
have the bulkhad,

00:30:26.900 --> 00:30:28.430
you go back to
generalist species.

00:30:28.430 --> 00:30:30.888
So this is kind of getting more
at the composition of who's

00:30:30.888 --> 00:30:34.090
really utilizing these habitats.

00:30:34.090 --> 00:30:36.740
So just to provide
some conclusions here,

00:30:36.740 --> 00:30:40.460
living shorelines we think so
far, not based just on the work

00:30:40.460 --> 00:30:42.400
I've done, but what
others have done,

00:30:42.400 --> 00:30:45.030
can serve as better habitat
for fish and crustaceans

00:30:45.030 --> 00:30:46.572
in bulkheads.

00:30:46.572 --> 00:30:48.030
And that at least
in North Carolina

00:30:48.030 --> 00:30:49.530
where you have
intertidal oysteries,

00:30:49.530 --> 00:30:51.790
they're functionally
similar to oyster reefs

00:30:51.790 --> 00:30:56.020
in terms of forage and
refuge opportunities.

00:30:56.020 --> 00:31:00.100
So I want to shift gears now
and talk about another aspect

00:31:00.100 --> 00:31:01.772
of shorelines.

00:31:01.772 --> 00:31:03.230
And that's really
whether or not we

00:31:03.230 --> 00:31:05.190
are creating sustainable,
resilient shorelines

00:31:05.190 --> 00:31:07.710
so we might find that
these living shorelines are

00:31:07.710 --> 00:31:10.890
ecologically better
than bulkheads.

00:31:10.890 --> 00:31:12.830
But if they don't
perform in terms

00:31:12.830 --> 00:31:15.272
of providing erosion
protection, no one's

00:31:15.272 --> 00:31:16.980
actually going to want
to implement them.

00:31:16.980 --> 00:31:19.354
They're going to want to stick
with the status quo, which

00:31:19.354 --> 00:31:19.900
is bulkheads.

00:31:19.900 --> 00:31:21.330
So while I was in
graduate school,

00:31:21.330 --> 00:31:25.277
Hurricane Irene came through
North Carolina in 2011.

00:31:25.277 --> 00:31:27.360
And it was about the middle
of my graduate career,

00:31:27.360 --> 00:31:29.401
so I had sampled a lot of
sites before the storm,

00:31:29.401 --> 00:31:32.610
and I was able to go back and
sample sites after the storm.

00:31:32.610 --> 00:31:36.270
And what I did initially
was just go along the areas

00:31:36.270 --> 00:31:39.220
that I knew that were hardest
hit by the hurricane and survey

00:31:39.220 --> 00:31:41.200
first just what type
of shoreline was there,

00:31:41.200 --> 00:31:44.520
just driving along in a
boat with a GPS and a camera

00:31:44.520 --> 00:31:46.400
and documenting the
type of shoreline there.

00:31:46.400 --> 00:31:49.370
So these are just regions
that I sampled and the kind.

00:31:49.370 --> 00:31:51.250
What I want to point
out here is that you

00:31:51.250 --> 00:31:52.650
have a pretty good mix.

00:31:52.650 --> 00:31:54.450
You have a lot of
natural shoreline,

00:31:54.450 --> 00:31:56.820
but you also have a lot of
hardened shoreline here.

00:31:56.820 --> 00:32:01.760
And it's mostly bulkheads, so
this is the bulkhead shoreline.

00:32:01.760 --> 00:32:03.509
And what I decided
to do was that I

00:32:03.509 --> 00:32:05.050
looked to the
engineering literature,

00:32:05.050 --> 00:32:07.341
because I'm an ecologist and
I was like how do I really

00:32:07.341 --> 00:32:10.380
quantify damage to
shoreline structures?

00:32:10.380 --> 00:32:13.270
And I came across the
engineering article that

00:32:13.270 --> 00:32:15.580
basically said they do
a visual classification

00:32:15.580 --> 00:32:17.600
and they assess whether
or not the structure

00:32:17.600 --> 00:32:21.680
is intact and performing the
function that it was intended.

00:32:21.680 --> 00:32:24.990
And so they had a classification
of landward erosion,

00:32:24.990 --> 00:32:26.240
which is shown here.

00:32:26.240 --> 00:32:29.240
So the structure is
intact, but the land

00:32:29.240 --> 00:32:32.040
that it's supposed to be
protecting has eroded away.

00:32:32.040 --> 00:32:34.670
So that's one
category of the image.

00:32:34.670 --> 00:32:37.060
The structure might
be intact but you have

00:32:37.060 --> 00:32:38.400
some kind of structural damage.

00:32:38.400 --> 00:32:39.760
So you have pieces
of the structure

00:32:39.760 --> 00:32:41.051
that are starting to fall away.

00:32:41.051 --> 00:32:44.051
That's another category of
damage you could assess.

00:32:44.051 --> 00:32:45.050
You could have a breach.

00:32:45.050 --> 00:32:47.190
So the structure is still
there, but it's actually

00:32:47.190 --> 00:32:51.320
compromised in some way
and the erosion of the land

00:32:51.320 --> 00:32:53.410
is actually occurring
behind the structure.

00:32:53.410 --> 00:32:55.740
And then you can have a
complete failure or a collapse.

00:32:55.740 --> 00:32:57.397
And so this is
what was shown here

00:32:57.397 --> 00:32:58.980
where the bulkhead
itself has actually

00:32:58.980 --> 00:33:03.920
fallen into the water and all of
the land has then eroded away.

00:33:03.920 --> 00:33:05.990
And so what this
graph is showing you

00:33:05.990 --> 00:33:08.340
is that for these
different regions

00:33:08.340 --> 00:33:11.020
how much of the
bulkheaded shoreline

00:33:11.020 --> 00:33:12.850
suffered some kind of damage.

00:33:12.850 --> 00:33:15.270
And so these three
regions really

00:33:15.270 --> 00:33:17.640
had low percentages of damage.

00:33:17.640 --> 00:33:20.290
But in this one particular area
that seemed to be hardest hit,

00:33:20.290 --> 00:33:24.510
75% of the bulkheads
had some kind of damage.

00:33:24.510 --> 00:33:26.660
And I only show bulkheads
here because none

00:33:26.660 --> 00:33:30.240
of the other types of
shoreline exhibited any damage.

00:33:30.240 --> 00:33:33.130
So the structure that was
most commonly implemented

00:33:33.130 --> 00:33:37.310
for protection was actually
the one most readily damaged

00:33:37.310 --> 00:33:38.990
in a Category 1 hurricane.

00:33:38.990 --> 00:33:40.490
And that's not even
a big hurricane.

00:33:40.490 --> 00:33:42.220
So that's not Superstorm Sandy.

00:33:42.220 --> 00:33:46.700
Irene was a blip compared to
what we saw in the Northeast.

00:33:46.700 --> 00:33:48.950
And I love to put
pictures, because I

00:33:48.950 --> 00:33:52.170
think they really kind of
sell the story even better.

00:33:52.170 --> 00:33:55.904
And these are two properties
that are roughly 500 feet away

00:33:55.904 --> 00:33:56.570
from each other.

00:33:56.570 --> 00:33:57.820
They're on the same shoreline.

00:33:57.820 --> 00:34:00.180
I've been sampling these
properties for years.

00:34:00.180 --> 00:34:03.370
This property owner, Mr.
Avery, has a bulkhead.

00:34:03.370 --> 00:34:06.110
That's just an arrow
to show for reference.

00:34:06.110 --> 00:34:08.520
Mr. Shallcross had a
living shoreline put in.

00:34:08.520 --> 00:34:10.690
This is a picture I took
one year before the storm

00:34:10.690 --> 00:34:13.400
where we actually planted
the marsh grass for him.

00:34:13.400 --> 00:34:15.929
And this is actually
right after the hurricane,

00:34:15.929 --> 00:34:18.130
so the water level
is still pretty high.

00:34:18.130 --> 00:34:19.929
His bulkhead
completely collapsed.

00:34:19.929 --> 00:34:24.480
He lost, he said, about
22 truckloads of sediment,

00:34:24.480 --> 00:34:27.420
which he then put back in
and rebuilt his bulkhead,

00:34:27.420 --> 00:34:31.760
I think for about $20,000,
even though I walked him down

00:34:31.760 --> 00:34:34.060
and I showed him that
this property actually

00:34:34.060 --> 00:34:40.790
had no damage except for other
people's bulkheads and docks.

00:34:40.790 --> 00:34:43.520
So the only damage Jim
really suffered with his deck

00:34:43.520 --> 00:34:47.670
was damaged by pilings,
bulkhead material washing up.

00:34:47.670 --> 00:34:50.206
So no rocks out of place.

00:34:50.206 --> 00:34:52.080
I mean the marsh actually
looks a lot better.

00:34:52.080 --> 00:34:53.440
So this is obviously
a year later.

00:34:53.440 --> 00:34:55.023
The plans have grown
up, but the water

00:34:55.023 --> 00:34:57.900
is really only high because it
was still high after the storm.

00:34:57.900 --> 00:35:00.210
I showed Mr. Ackery
this property

00:35:00.210 --> 00:35:03.790
and he said that he was
trying to sell his house.

00:35:03.790 --> 00:35:07.790
And he said I will
probably be able to sell it

00:35:07.790 --> 00:35:09.950
for more if I rebuild the
bulkhead because people

00:35:09.950 --> 00:35:11.860
like bulkheads.

00:35:11.860 --> 00:35:15.030
So that's that's happened.

00:35:15.030 --> 00:35:16.970
And so, I show
you those pictures

00:35:16.970 --> 00:35:19.750
but I also wanted to make
sure, just because sometimes it

00:35:19.750 --> 00:35:23.900
can be hard to actually quantify
damage to a natural shoreline,

00:35:23.900 --> 00:35:26.840
that we weren't just
observing-- it wasn't just

00:35:26.840 --> 00:35:29.180
that we weren't able
to detect the damage

00:35:29.180 --> 00:35:31.090
that these shorelines
were experiencing.

00:35:31.090 --> 00:35:35.010
And so I had a series of natural
marsh shorelines and shorelines

00:35:35.010 --> 00:35:35.980
with a sill.

00:35:35.980 --> 00:35:38.305
So the black is the
sill and the open circle

00:35:38.305 --> 00:35:39.430
are these marsh shorelines.

00:35:39.430 --> 00:35:42.200
And I was able to
sample a year before,

00:35:42.200 --> 00:35:45.070
right after, and then a
year after the hurricane.

00:35:45.070 --> 00:35:47.570
This is the surface
elevation of that site.

00:35:47.570 --> 00:35:50.014
So surface elevation is
essentially a proxy for

00:35:50.014 --> 00:35:51.180
whether or not it's eroding.

00:35:51.180 --> 00:35:52.770
If the elevation
doesn't change, it's

00:35:52.770 --> 00:35:55.600
not eroding, if it drops
it means it's eroding.

00:35:55.600 --> 00:35:58.680
We saw no change in
those sites through time.

00:35:58.680 --> 00:36:00.790
And then this is
vegetation density.

00:36:00.790 --> 00:36:03.780
So this is the actual number
of plants in the marsh.

00:36:03.780 --> 00:36:05.440
And we did see a
drop in the plants.

00:36:05.440 --> 00:36:07.980
So these lines were
affected by the hurricane.

00:36:07.980 --> 00:36:10.220
But the neat part is
that particularly when

00:36:10.220 --> 00:36:13.451
you had a sill, those plants
rebounded naturally within one

00:36:13.451 --> 00:36:13.950
year.

00:36:13.950 --> 00:36:16.740
So this is really getting
more to the resilience

00:36:16.740 --> 00:36:18.250
part of the shoreline.

00:36:18.250 --> 00:36:22.000
This property owner, Mr.
Shallcross, his shoreline

00:36:22.000 --> 00:36:23.870
is part of this data set.

00:36:23.870 --> 00:36:26.710
He's not having to do
anything to his shoreline

00:36:26.710 --> 00:36:28.540
for it to recover
from a storm event.

00:36:28.540 --> 00:36:32.520
So it's not only that they
sustain the shoreline better

00:36:32.520 --> 00:36:34.250
by preventing erosion,
but they're also

00:36:34.250 --> 00:36:38.120
more resilient in terms of
rebounding from the bulkheads.

00:36:38.120 --> 00:36:39.590
We're continuing
some of this work.

00:36:39.590 --> 00:36:41.920
I have a graduate student
at UNC that I'm currently

00:36:41.920 --> 00:36:44.670
working with, where this
was one storm event.

00:36:44.670 --> 00:36:47.170
It could have just
been the perfect storm

00:36:47.170 --> 00:36:51.590
to for marshes to do well and
for bulkheads to do poorly.

00:36:51.590 --> 00:36:54.310
So we decided that we were
going to continue this work.

00:36:54.310 --> 00:36:56.460
And she actually went out
after hurricane Arthur

00:36:56.460 --> 00:37:00.520
in 2014, another category
1 storm, slightly different

00:37:00.520 --> 00:37:02.910
in that it came in
a different tide,

00:37:02.910 --> 00:37:04.790
so the storm surge
was different.

00:37:04.790 --> 00:37:06.660
It was a much
faster moving storm.

00:37:06.660 --> 00:37:09.400
So the impacts were
potentially very different.

00:37:09.400 --> 00:37:11.740
And so she's actually
analyzing these data now.

00:37:11.740 --> 00:37:13.240
But she went back
to the same places

00:37:13.240 --> 00:37:15.270
I did, did the same assessments.

00:37:15.270 --> 00:37:17.430
And we're going to see
if we see similar trends

00:37:17.430 --> 00:37:21.020
with the second hurricane.

00:37:21.020 --> 00:37:23.660
And we're combining this with
a little bit of social science.

00:37:23.660 --> 00:37:25.820
So a colleague of mine at
Northeastern University,

00:37:25.820 --> 00:37:29.310
Steven Scyphers, does a lot
of socioeconomic surveys.

00:37:29.310 --> 00:37:32.560
And so we have a grant
where we surveyed

00:37:32.560 --> 00:37:35.350
through online and
postcard mailings

00:37:35.350 --> 00:37:38.630
approximately 850 waterfront
residents in North Carolina.

00:37:38.630 --> 00:37:41.350
And we've asked them questions
about their perceptions

00:37:41.350 --> 00:37:43.740
of shoreline hardening in
terms of whether they think

00:37:43.740 --> 00:37:46.790
it's effective or durable by
type, whether it's a bulkhead,

00:37:46.790 --> 00:37:48.790
or riprap or living shoreline.

00:37:48.790 --> 00:37:50.290
And we've also asked
them to tell us

00:37:50.290 --> 00:37:54.230
how much damage they've
had, what's caused it,

00:37:54.230 --> 00:37:58.170
and what it costs them in terms
of repair and maintenance.

00:37:58.170 --> 00:38:00.910
And so we're just starting
to look at the data now.

00:38:00.910 --> 00:38:04.530
So I'm just showing you a
few graphs from the work

00:38:04.530 --> 00:38:06.300
that Carter has
really been leading.

00:38:06.300 --> 00:38:08.230
These top graphs
are the percentage

00:38:08.230 --> 00:38:12.090
of respondents that report
any kind of damage at all

00:38:12.090 --> 00:38:13.644
or any kind of maintenance cost.

00:38:13.644 --> 00:38:15.060
And then these are
the respondents

00:38:15.060 --> 00:38:17.750
that if they report
damage costs, how much,

00:38:17.750 --> 00:38:20.250
and if they report
maintenance costs, how much.

00:38:20.250 --> 00:38:22.240
And so what I really
want to highlight here

00:38:22.240 --> 00:38:25.060
is that these natural
shorelines, so predominantly

00:38:25.060 --> 00:38:27.930
marsh shorelines are
lower in terms of just

00:38:27.930 --> 00:38:30.770
whether they report damage
at all or maintenance at all.

00:38:30.770 --> 00:38:33.500
So there's a lot of people
who are reporting no damage

00:38:33.500 --> 00:38:36.690
or maintenance the entire
lifetime of their shoreline.

00:38:36.690 --> 00:38:39.490
And then even if they are
reporting damage or maintenance

00:38:39.490 --> 00:38:41.240
costs, they are
significantly lower

00:38:41.240 --> 00:38:44.305
than these bulkhead shorelines,
which are most common.

00:38:44.305 --> 00:38:46.680
Riprap is the other shoreling
that we're really not sure,

00:38:46.680 --> 00:38:49.640
we think riprap tends to be
more resilient than bulkheading,

00:38:49.640 --> 00:38:51.940
just because it's rock
kind of piled on shore.

00:38:51.940 --> 00:38:54.450
And so it's not suffering
from the same kind

00:38:54.450 --> 00:38:56.480
of structural failure.

00:38:56.480 --> 00:38:59.420
But we're still kind of
exploring, because many,

00:38:59.420 --> 00:39:02.740
many fewer people have riprap
shorelines in North Carolina

00:39:02.740 --> 00:39:05.480
than bulkhead shorelining.

00:39:05.480 --> 00:39:09.540
So I kind of want to finish with
kind of a thought about what

00:39:09.540 --> 00:39:11.570
it would really
take to get people

00:39:11.570 --> 00:39:12.900
to shift to living shorelines.

00:39:12.900 --> 00:39:15.260
So we've shown you the ecology.

00:39:15.260 --> 00:39:17.640
We showed you a little
bit of the engineering.

00:39:17.640 --> 00:39:19.960
We've also showed you a
little bit of the cost.

00:39:19.960 --> 00:39:24.730
But people are still
resistant to change.

00:39:24.730 --> 00:39:26.582
They like the status quo.

00:39:26.582 --> 00:39:28.290
They like what they've
known for decades.

00:39:28.290 --> 00:39:30.280
Bulkheads have been
something we've

00:39:30.280 --> 00:39:33.330
used for a long time
along our coastlines.

00:39:33.330 --> 00:39:35.340
And so this is work by
our colleague, Steven,

00:39:35.340 --> 00:39:37.520
where he's surveyed
people and asked them,

00:39:37.520 --> 00:39:40.560
would they be willing to
try a living shoreline?

00:39:40.560 --> 00:39:42.290
And initially he
just surveyed them

00:39:42.290 --> 00:39:43.840
and asked them that
simple question.

00:39:43.840 --> 00:39:47.240
And in Alabama, 60%, no way.

00:39:47.240 --> 00:39:48.590
They want a bulkhead.

00:39:48.590 --> 00:39:53.180
But then he asked, well what if
we had some kind of cost share,

00:39:53.180 --> 00:39:55.750
and he varied the amount of
money that was cost shared.

00:39:55.750 --> 00:39:59.150
So the State would maybe give
you a tax credit for instance.

00:39:59.150 --> 00:40:03.100
And the remarkable part is that
people were really much more

00:40:03.100 --> 00:40:04.720
likely to consider it.

00:40:04.720 --> 00:40:08.130
40% of the people changed their
mind a little bit and said,

00:40:08.130 --> 00:40:10.030
yeah, maybe I would
be a little unsure

00:40:10.030 --> 00:40:12.370
or maybe I would be even
likely to build a living

00:40:12.370 --> 00:40:16.640
shoreline if all of
the cost wasn't on me.

00:40:16.640 --> 00:40:19.780
We did have roughly 6%
of Alabama respondents

00:40:19.780 --> 00:40:21.580
who actually went in
the other direction.

00:40:21.580 --> 00:40:22.740
And that's because
they were people

00:40:22.740 --> 00:40:24.710
who commented and believed
that they don't want

00:40:24.710 --> 00:40:28.000
the government spending
taxpayer dollars on any kind

00:40:28.000 --> 00:40:28.930
of private property.

00:40:28.930 --> 00:40:32.576
So that's that 6%
that you see there.

00:40:32.576 --> 00:40:34.450
And so this is just a
picture of a conversion

00:40:34.450 --> 00:40:36.533
of a bulkhead to a living
shoreline, where they've

00:40:36.533 --> 00:40:39.160
actually not removed this
bulkhead, they've essentially

00:40:39.160 --> 00:40:41.060
filled in on top of
it and planed marsh.

00:40:41.060 --> 00:40:46.150
So this is something they're
trying with NGOs and with cost

00:40:46.150 --> 00:40:48.060
incentives in some areas.

00:40:48.060 --> 00:40:50.730
And we're starting to
see some progress there.

00:40:50.730 --> 00:40:54.370
So that's kind of the positive
note I want to end on,

00:40:54.370 --> 00:40:58.800
is that living shorelines are
a viable option in some places.

00:40:58.800 --> 00:41:00.560
It's not going to
work everywhere.

00:41:00.560 --> 00:41:03.630
And with the right amount
of education and incentives,

00:41:03.630 --> 00:41:06.640
it's possible we could push
private property owners

00:41:06.640 --> 00:41:09.480
in the direction of
thinking about the long term

00:41:09.480 --> 00:41:12.440
sustainability and resilience
and ecological function

00:41:12.440 --> 00:41:14.760
of the shorelines,
rather than just, I

00:41:14.760 --> 00:41:17.410
want my property to stay exactly
the way it is for the next 30

00:41:17.410 --> 00:41:19.030
years.

00:41:19.030 --> 00:41:21.490
So with that I just want to
thank all of my collaborators,

00:41:21.490 --> 00:41:24.185
my co-authors, funding
sources over my graduate work

00:41:24.185 --> 00:41:25.750
and my postdoc work.

00:41:25.750 --> 00:41:28.400
And if you have more
questions, Steven

00:41:28.400 --> 00:41:30.020
has developed this
shoreline site

00:41:30.020 --> 00:41:33.010
where you can actually post
your own personal experiences

00:41:33.010 --> 00:41:37.539
if you're a private homeowner to
this site with your shoreline.

00:41:37.539 --> 00:41:39.330
You can even contact
us and we can send you

00:41:39.330 --> 00:41:42.610
a camera, if you're
willing to take pictures

00:41:42.610 --> 00:41:44.150
during storm events.

00:41:44.150 --> 00:41:46.397
And we have some lab
pages and Twitter

00:41:46.397 --> 00:41:48.230
account if you want to
get in touch with me.

00:41:48.230 --> 00:41:49.220
So, thank you.

00:41:49.220 --> 00:41:50.941
[APPLAUSE]

00:41:56.200 --> 00:41:59.990
-OK, thank you, Rachel, i
was bursting with questions.

00:41:59.990 --> 00:42:04.090
But I have to stick to my
own self-imposed format.

00:42:04.090 --> 00:42:06.890
Yeah, you'll have to wait.

00:42:06.890 --> 00:42:10.652
So as I said, we'll have
the two talks and then

00:42:10.652 --> 00:42:15.830
a question and answer session
and then a short break.

00:42:15.830 --> 00:42:23.490
So our next speaker is
Anna Sirovic, Anna Sirovic.

00:42:23.490 --> 00:42:26.050
Sorry.

00:42:26.050 --> 00:42:30.980
She's a researcher in
the marine bioacoustics

00:42:30.980 --> 00:42:35.120
lab at Scripps, and
in particular focusing

00:42:35.120 --> 00:42:39.550
on marine bioacoustics,
and in particular

00:42:39.550 --> 00:42:43.680
of exploited marine mammals,
which I take to mean

00:42:43.680 --> 00:42:47.300
whales and that sort of thing.

00:42:47.300 --> 00:42:50.190
So I don't know why,
but I have to come up

00:42:50.190 --> 00:42:52.472
with some anecdote for
each talk or at least

00:42:52.472 --> 00:42:53.680
something that fascinated me.

00:42:53.680 --> 00:42:58.260
And I guess, although
I knew that whales talk

00:42:58.260 --> 00:43:03.580
to each other I grew up hearing
about songs of humpback whales,

00:43:03.580 --> 00:43:06.230
I only recently heard an
anecdote which I really

00:43:06.230 --> 00:43:07.150
have to track down.

00:43:07.150 --> 00:43:11.960
I have to try this that
evidently Inouit, a group

00:43:11.960 --> 00:43:16.850
of Inouit in what used to be
the Northwest Territories, which

00:43:16.850 --> 00:43:22.600
guess in now the Netsilik
Territory in Canada,

00:43:22.600 --> 00:43:25.050
they would hunt whales.

00:43:25.050 --> 00:43:26.740
The way they would
find whales is

00:43:26.740 --> 00:43:29.680
to take a paddle,
their kayak paddle,

00:43:29.680 --> 00:43:33.030
and put it in the water put
their ear next to the paddle

00:43:33.030 --> 00:43:35.260
blade, and they
could actually hear

00:43:35.260 --> 00:43:36.862
when the whales were close by.

00:43:36.862 --> 00:43:39.070
And that would be how they
would know they were close

00:43:39.070 --> 00:43:40.900
and they could actually
go on the hunt.

00:43:40.900 --> 00:43:43.900
So apparently
bioacoustics has been

00:43:43.900 --> 00:43:47.430
known to humans for
years and years,

00:43:47.430 --> 00:43:51.060
but it's now being
used to understand them

00:43:51.060 --> 00:43:56.530
and unfortunately, one of
the byproducts of humans

00:43:56.530 --> 00:43:59.090
is to pollute just
about everything

00:43:59.090 --> 00:44:00.560
we can get our hands on.

00:44:00.560 --> 00:44:02.590
So we have light
pollution in the sky

00:44:02.590 --> 00:44:04.650
and we have noise
pollution in the oceans.

00:44:04.650 --> 00:44:08.050
So anyway, Anna.

00:44:08.050 --> 00:44:09.674
[APPLAUSE]

00:44:12.382 --> 00:44:13.840
-So thank you for
the introduction.

00:44:13.840 --> 00:44:17.870
And my career as
a bioacoustician,

00:44:17.870 --> 00:44:20.610
I've been spanning
the fields of biology

00:44:20.610 --> 00:44:23.010
and engineering pretty
much this whole time.

00:44:23.010 --> 00:44:27.570
And so I do much
less well with jokes.

00:44:27.570 --> 00:44:29.550
So I promise that my
title is the only pun

00:44:29.550 --> 00:44:30.700
I'm going to try on you.

00:44:30.700 --> 00:44:33.670
But I do promise to play
you a lot of sounds,

00:44:33.670 --> 00:44:36.430
because I think that's the
really cool part and the really

00:44:36.430 --> 00:44:38.500
fascinating part
about all of this.

00:44:38.500 --> 00:44:42.720
But what I will tell you about
today is two kind of stories,

00:44:42.720 --> 00:44:46.470
two different examples of
how I, with my colleagues,

00:44:46.470 --> 00:44:48.140
have been using
sounds that animals

00:44:48.140 --> 00:44:52.000
make to learn more about
endangered marine species.

00:44:52.000 --> 00:44:55.720
And I'll have an example about
blue whales and another example

00:44:55.720 --> 00:44:59.530
on grouper and fish, to
see how we can learn more

00:44:59.530 --> 00:45:04.350
about the populations and
use it for better management

00:45:04.350 --> 00:45:05.800
approaches.

00:45:05.800 --> 00:45:11.210
So ocean is in fact
a very noisy place,

00:45:11.210 --> 00:45:13.815
partly because sound in the
ocean travels really well.

00:45:13.815 --> 00:45:16.050
It travels much further
than light does.

00:45:16.050 --> 00:45:18.930
So a lot of animals use
it then to communicate.

00:45:18.930 --> 00:45:21.430
Because it's a lot harder to
see things in the ocean than it

00:45:21.430 --> 00:45:22.990
is to hear things.

00:45:22.990 --> 00:45:28.360
And among [INAUDIBLE]
it's not just the animals

00:45:28.360 --> 00:45:30.130
that are making sounds.

00:45:30.130 --> 00:45:32.680
Just about anything in and
around the ocean make sounds.

00:45:32.680 --> 00:45:34.680
So first of all, there's
lots of natural sources

00:45:34.680 --> 00:45:38.820
of sound in the ocean,
things like rain, waves,

00:45:38.820 --> 00:45:40.510
or even earthquakes.

00:45:40.510 --> 00:45:46.050
They are, let's see if
can play this for you.

00:45:46.050 --> 00:45:48.462
They're kind of intermittent
sources of sound, so.

00:45:48.462 --> 00:45:50.270
[RAINSTORM SOUNDS]

00:45:54.357 --> 00:45:55.190
Sounds like thunder.

00:45:55.190 --> 00:45:57.940
But it's really the sound of an
earthquake underwater recorded

00:45:57.940 --> 00:46:00.020
by hydrophones.

00:46:00.020 --> 00:46:03.517
And a lot of these natural
sources, what I call them,

00:46:03.517 --> 00:46:05.350
are very low frequency,
kind of low pitched,

00:46:05.350 --> 00:46:07.670
kind of like you
heard that sound.

00:46:07.670 --> 00:46:10.590
In addition to these
sounds, lots of animals

00:46:10.590 --> 00:46:13.190
make sounds, not just
whales, which are probably

00:46:13.190 --> 00:46:15.410
the ones you're
most familiar with,

00:46:15.410 --> 00:46:18.584
but also fish and invertebrates
also make a lot of sounds.

00:46:18.584 --> 00:46:20.750
So just a couple of examples
I want to play for you.

00:46:20.750 --> 00:46:22.550
I'm not going to play humpback
whale songs because everybody

00:46:22.550 --> 00:46:23.710
has heard those.

00:46:23.710 --> 00:46:26.620
But here one example, this
is a sperm whale clicking.

00:46:26.620 --> 00:46:29.620
[CLICKING]

00:46:38.120 --> 00:46:40.270
Sperm whales use these
clicks for echolocaiton,

00:46:40.270 --> 00:46:43.740
similar to what bats are doing.

00:46:43.740 --> 00:46:45.950
But then, rather than
playing you a humpback song,

00:46:45.950 --> 00:46:48.890
I want to play you
in minke whale song.

00:46:48.890 --> 00:46:50.870
And this is a minke
whale that you

00:46:50.870 --> 00:46:53.640
would hear if you went off shore
here in the Atlantic somewhere

00:46:53.640 --> 00:46:55.490
and stuck your
head in the ocean.

00:46:55.490 --> 00:46:57.199
Because, you can in
fact, if you are even

00:46:57.199 --> 00:46:59.448
swimming around or diving,
you can hear these animals.

00:46:59.448 --> 00:47:01.740
They're so loud that
you can often hear them

00:47:01.740 --> 00:47:02.950
if they're in the vicinity.

00:47:02.950 --> 00:47:04.732
[HEARTBEAT SOUNDS]

00:47:07.330 --> 00:47:10.090
Now, a couple of unique things
about this minke whale song

00:47:10.090 --> 00:47:12.150
is that actually, if you
notice, it is very long.

00:47:12.150 --> 00:47:14.375
It will just go on for a while.

00:47:14.375 --> 00:47:17.270
And I am playing
this at regular speed

00:47:17.270 --> 00:47:18.780
as it was recorded in the ocean.

00:47:18.780 --> 00:47:20.520
So this is literally
what you would

00:47:20.520 --> 00:47:22.060
hear if you go
out there and just

00:47:22.060 --> 00:47:23.932
were in the vicinity of one.

00:47:23.932 --> 00:47:26.287
[HEARTBEAT SOUNDS]

00:47:30.530 --> 00:47:33.510
And so this repetitive nature
is also one of the features

00:47:33.510 --> 00:47:35.985
that we see commonly,
particularly for baleen whales,

00:47:35.985 --> 00:47:39.980
where they're just making sounds
over and over and over again.

00:47:39.980 --> 00:47:47.170
But another interesting part,
speeding up a little bit.

00:47:47.170 --> 00:47:48.534
Sometimes they slow down.

00:47:48.534 --> 00:47:49.450
Sometimes to speed up.

00:47:49.450 --> 00:47:50.590
Sometimes they keep it constant.

00:47:50.590 --> 00:47:51.760
We don't really know why.

00:47:51.760 --> 00:47:54.195
But so as you said, this
is what minke whales here

00:47:54.195 --> 00:47:55.320
in the Atlantic sound like.

00:47:55.320 --> 00:47:56.810
If you went into
the Pacific, they

00:47:56.810 --> 00:47:58.060
sound totally different there.

00:47:58.060 --> 00:48:00.500
And this is also a common
thing I'll get to in a minute.

00:48:00.500 --> 00:48:03.083
But I just wanted to entice you
with that piece of information

00:48:03.083 --> 00:48:04.120
here.

00:48:04.120 --> 00:48:07.020
But then of course another
important source of sound

00:48:07.020 --> 00:48:09.290
is us humans.

00:48:09.290 --> 00:48:14.644
Shipping is a huge contributor
to the low frequency noise.

00:48:14.644 --> 00:48:16.830
So you can hear the
propellers of boats.

00:48:20.657 --> 00:48:22.240
And so again, this
is a type of sound,

00:48:22.240 --> 00:48:23.810
because they are
typically low frequency,

00:48:23.810 --> 00:48:25.310
they will travel
over long distances

00:48:25.310 --> 00:48:27.620
and can contribute
to increased noise

00:48:27.620 --> 00:48:30.150
levels across large areas.

00:48:30.150 --> 00:48:32.440
But there are other, also
anthropogenic sources,

00:48:32.440 --> 00:48:35.340
such as oil and gas exploration
that are large contributors

00:48:35.340 --> 00:48:39.700
of ocean noise pollution, as are
even things that echo sounders.

00:48:39.700 --> 00:48:42.240
When you're going out fishing
and your little fish finder

00:48:42.240 --> 00:48:48.160
is on, that's loud and
noisy navy sonar, et cetera.

00:48:48.160 --> 00:48:51.470
So to listen to all
these kinds of sounds,

00:48:51.470 --> 00:48:55.000
we use a variety of
underwater recording devices.

00:48:55.000 --> 00:48:57.710
And since I'm mostly interested
in long term trends and changes

00:48:57.710 --> 00:49:00.500
over a long time, what
I've mostly been using

00:49:00.500 --> 00:49:02.310
are autonomous
recorders that you

00:49:02.310 --> 00:49:05.370
can deploy on the ocean floor
for extended periods of time,

00:49:05.370 --> 00:49:07.100
and they just record
all the sounds

00:49:07.100 --> 00:49:10.740
over a certain bandwidth, over
a certain frequency range.

00:49:10.740 --> 00:49:13.166
And all of these devices,
they have the same features.

00:49:13.166 --> 00:49:14.790
They are fundamentally
the same things.

00:49:14.790 --> 00:49:16.590
They consist of a
hydrophone, which

00:49:16.590 --> 00:49:18.400
is an underwater microphone.

00:49:18.400 --> 00:49:22.070
They have a data logging
system of some sort, hard disk

00:49:22.070 --> 00:49:23.710
to store the data--
we have to retrieve

00:49:23.710 --> 00:49:27.070
the instruments typically to
get our data back and download

00:49:27.070 --> 00:49:28.360
them.

00:49:28.360 --> 00:49:31.130
Batteries, and so those
two factors the batteries

00:49:31.130 --> 00:49:33.930
and the hard disk
space are going

00:49:33.930 --> 00:49:35.480
to limit how long
you can actually

00:49:35.480 --> 00:49:36.987
deploy them on the ocean floor.

00:49:36.987 --> 00:49:38.570
On the left hand
side, I'm showing you

00:49:38.570 --> 00:49:43.540
this is an instrument that
we built in house at Scripps.

00:49:43.540 --> 00:49:45.807
Typically it's a
fairly large device.

00:49:45.807 --> 00:49:48.140
It's called a high frequency
acoustic recording package.

00:49:48.140 --> 00:49:51.210
And we can deploy these
instruments for up to a year,

00:49:51.210 --> 00:49:52.690
recording at very
large bandwidth,

00:49:52.690 --> 00:49:54.750
leave them in deep water.

00:49:54.750 --> 00:49:57.440
And when we retrieve
them, get information

00:49:57.440 --> 00:50:01.000
on a plethora of anthropogenic
sounds and animal sounds

00:50:01.000 --> 00:50:04.855
and any other kind of geographic
or physical sounds as well.

00:50:04.855 --> 00:50:06.480
On the right hand
side, I'm showing you

00:50:06.480 --> 00:50:10.587
an example of a recorder that's
actually an off the shelf

00:50:10.587 --> 00:50:11.670
recorder you can just buy.

00:50:11.670 --> 00:50:14.253
It's actually a company here in
Massachusetts that makes them.

00:50:14.253 --> 00:50:16.802
And we've been using this for
some of the shallow water,

00:50:16.802 --> 00:50:17.635
shorter deployments.

00:50:17.635 --> 00:50:20.040
This is actually
from the grouper work

00:50:20.040 --> 00:50:21.450
that I'll be talking about.

00:50:21.450 --> 00:50:24.677
So there's a variety of
possibilities and scales

00:50:24.677 --> 00:50:26.010
in which these instruments come.

00:50:26.010 --> 00:50:30.550
But again, the idea is to get
long term records of sounds

00:50:30.550 --> 00:50:31.860
from underwater.

00:50:31.860 --> 00:50:33.410
And once we have
these records, we

00:50:33.410 --> 00:50:35.692
can learn a lot about
the actual animals

00:50:35.692 --> 00:50:36.900
that are making those sounds.

00:50:36.900 --> 00:50:40.780
We can learn a lot about
their distribution, also

00:50:40.780 --> 00:50:44.390
population structure or trends,
because most of the animals

00:50:44.390 --> 00:50:46.310
have species specific calls.

00:50:46.310 --> 00:50:49.174
Sometimes they're
even area specific.

00:50:49.174 --> 00:50:50.840
We can learn about
behavior because they

00:50:50.840 --> 00:50:52.770
produce different
calls, depending

00:50:52.770 --> 00:50:53.870
on their behavioral state.

00:50:53.870 --> 00:50:56.830
If they're hungry or if
they're looking for a mate,

00:50:56.830 --> 00:50:59.470
just like humans they're
going to say different things.

00:50:59.470 --> 00:51:01.770
And then ultimately,
we want to apply this

00:51:01.770 --> 00:51:06.440
to species management or to also
understand how us humans are

00:51:06.440 --> 00:51:08.320
impacting the animals.

00:51:08.320 --> 00:51:12.251
So, with that introduction, let
me start with the first case

00:51:12.251 --> 00:51:12.750
study.

00:51:12.750 --> 00:51:14.920
I want to talk about
blue whales for a minute.

00:51:14.920 --> 00:51:16.760
And blue whales, I
don't know if any of you

00:51:16.760 --> 00:51:18.801
have ever had the fortune
of seeing a blue whale,

00:51:18.801 --> 00:51:20.561
but they're awesome animals.

00:51:20.561 --> 00:51:22.560
They are the largest
animal that has ever lived.

00:51:22.560 --> 00:51:24.290
They are bigger
than any dinosaur.

00:51:24.290 --> 00:51:28.390
They can be up to 30
meters long, or 100 feet,

00:51:28.390 --> 00:51:30.440
if you prefer that system.

00:51:30.440 --> 00:51:34.260
They can weigh up to 200 tons.

00:51:34.260 --> 00:51:36.120
It's a massive, massive thing.

00:51:36.120 --> 00:51:39.175
And we find them across
all of the world's oceans.

00:51:39.175 --> 00:51:41.550
They are migratory animals,
like most of the other baleen

00:51:41.550 --> 00:51:42.230
whales.

00:51:42.230 --> 00:51:47.150
They spend winters in kind of
lower latitudes, warmer waters,

00:51:47.150 --> 00:51:50.204
mating and breeding and they
travel to higher latitude

00:51:50.204 --> 00:51:52.370
regions that are more
productive and they feed there

00:51:52.370 --> 00:51:54.550
during the summer.

00:51:54.550 --> 00:51:59.840
Currently, we know there's
at least three subspecies

00:51:59.840 --> 00:52:01.001
of blue whales.

00:52:01.001 --> 00:52:03.000
The Antarctic blue whale
is the largest of them.

00:52:03.000 --> 00:52:07.950
This is the one that's up to 100
feet long and 30 meters long.

00:52:07.950 --> 00:52:09.980
They're found around
the Antarctic continent.

00:52:09.980 --> 00:52:12.146
They were the primary target
of the whaling industry

00:52:12.146 --> 00:52:14.620
in the early 20th
century because they

00:52:14.620 --> 00:52:17.190
have a lot of blubber,
which meant a lot of oil

00:52:17.190 --> 00:52:20.290
that the whaling
industry was after.

00:52:20.290 --> 00:52:23.112
The second subspecies are
the pygmy blue whales.

00:52:23.112 --> 00:52:24.570
They're really
pygmy little things.

00:52:24.570 --> 00:52:28.320
They only are about 24
meters long, still quite

00:52:28.320 --> 00:52:30.250
substantial in weight
as well, because they

00:52:30.250 --> 00:52:31.820
tend to be shorter in stock.

00:52:31.820 --> 00:52:34.360
They have shorter
tail and longer heads.

00:52:34.360 --> 00:52:37.290
So still provide a lot of oil.

00:52:37.290 --> 00:52:40.640
They're initially found
in the Indian Ocean.

00:52:40.640 --> 00:52:45.190
So we constrain that subspecies
to that geographic region.

00:52:45.190 --> 00:52:48.150
And then finally, all
of the other blue whales

00:52:48.150 --> 00:52:50.120
in other oceans,
we just put them

00:52:50.120 --> 00:52:53.390
all in the same subspecies of
just your general blue whale.

00:52:53.390 --> 00:52:56.130
Now the reason why
I study blue whales

00:52:56.130 --> 00:52:58.500
is that they actually
are very vocal.

00:52:58.500 --> 00:53:02.800
They produce songs that
are quite distinct.

00:53:02.800 --> 00:53:06.340
They're very low frequency,
kind of low pitched songs

00:53:06.340 --> 00:53:07.810
and they're very loud.

00:53:07.810 --> 00:53:10.400
They can travel over
very long distances.

00:53:10.400 --> 00:53:13.980
And about 10 years ago,
Mark McDonald and colleagues

00:53:13.980 --> 00:53:19.560
offered this hypothesis
that the different songs

00:53:19.560 --> 00:53:21.820
that blue whales sing
in different populations

00:53:21.820 --> 00:53:25.610
might actually indicate
separate populations.

00:53:25.610 --> 00:53:27.360
Rather than having
these three subspecies,

00:53:27.360 --> 00:53:29.110
we might think of it in a
little bit finer scales.

00:53:29.110 --> 00:53:30.750
Because we know that even
though I said that they're

00:53:30.750 --> 00:53:33.426
found in all the world's
oceans, they are really distinct

00:53:33.426 --> 00:53:34.800
populations in
places where we do

00:53:34.800 --> 00:53:36.400
and we don't see blue whales.

00:53:36.400 --> 00:53:39.520
And so this map shows
that information

00:53:39.520 --> 00:53:42.280
based on these different
songs of blue whales

00:53:42.280 --> 00:53:45.710
where we know and
see them occurring.

00:53:45.710 --> 00:53:48.890
And so for example,
off the coast

00:53:48.890 --> 00:53:51.420
of California,
Washington, and Oregon,

00:53:51.420 --> 00:53:53.030
there is one
population that moves

00:53:53.030 --> 00:53:55.705
from Central America up
to Southern California

00:53:55.705 --> 00:53:58.165
and up the Gulf of
Alaska seasonally.

00:53:58.165 --> 00:53:59.790
There is also another
population that's

00:53:59.790 --> 00:54:02.430
more kind of in the Central
and Western Pacific.

00:54:02.430 --> 00:54:04.932
There's a population of blue
whales offshore here as well.

00:54:04.932 --> 00:54:06.390
But then in the
Southern hemisphere

00:54:06.390 --> 00:54:08.765
we have a couple of different
populations in the Southern

00:54:08.765 --> 00:54:10.810
Indian Ocean and one
in the Northern Indian.

00:54:10.810 --> 00:54:13.220
And then this
Antarctic blue whale

00:54:13.220 --> 00:54:16.970
that is the largest
of them all down

00:54:16.970 --> 00:54:18.900
circumpolarly around Antarctica.

00:54:18.900 --> 00:54:22.626
And so, let me play for you
a couple of their songs,

00:54:22.626 --> 00:54:25.000
because I want to demonstrate
to you how they're actually

00:54:25.000 --> 00:54:25.520
very different.

00:54:25.520 --> 00:54:26.350
So you'll be able to hear them.

00:54:26.350 --> 00:54:28.640
Now actually to hear them,
I had to speed them up.

00:54:28.640 --> 00:54:30.500
Like I said, they're
very, very low pitched.

00:54:30.500 --> 00:54:31.890
They're below our hearing.

00:54:31.890 --> 00:54:34.770
But I've sped all of
these songs four times,

00:54:34.770 --> 00:54:40.196
which means that they are
four times higher frequency.

00:54:40.196 --> 00:54:41.237
So that's the first part.

00:54:41.237 --> 00:54:43.860
[SOFT BEEPING SOUND]

00:54:43.860 --> 00:54:47.927
And four times shorter
duration, so they're

00:54:47.927 --> 00:54:49.635
really faster than
they would be usually.

00:54:56.150 --> 00:54:57.570
So this up here
is a spectrogram.

00:54:57.570 --> 00:55:00.640
That's a way that we represent
kind of visually sounds.

00:55:00.640 --> 00:55:04.130
And it's time on the x-axis
and frequency on the y-axis.

00:55:04.130 --> 00:55:06.570
So that first pulsing
bit is this right here

00:55:06.570 --> 00:55:09.190
and then the tone
is the second part.

00:55:09.190 --> 00:55:13.050
So that is our North
East Pacific Blue Whale.

00:55:13.050 --> 00:55:15.050
Just for comparison,
let me play to you

00:55:15.050 --> 00:55:19.486
the blue whales as they
sound off of Australia.

00:55:19.486 --> 00:55:21.478
[WHOOSHING, HUMMING SOUND]

00:55:29.446 --> 00:55:31.890
And again, these are
sped up four times

00:55:31.890 --> 00:55:33.360
like the previous
ones, so you can

00:55:33.360 --> 00:55:35.068
hear there's a different
pattern to them.

00:55:35.068 --> 00:55:36.790
[HUMMING SOUND]

00:55:41.690 --> 00:55:44.140
So now we're having
a little bit of gap.

00:55:44.140 --> 00:55:46.100
[LOW HUMMING SOUND]

00:55:52.470 --> 00:55:56.340
I want to also play for you
the Antarctic blue whale calls.

00:55:56.340 --> 00:55:59.080
And so here it's harder
to see them here.

00:55:59.080 --> 00:56:02.030
But these little blips
down here, they're

00:56:02.030 --> 00:56:03.330
Antarctic blue whale calls.

00:56:03.330 --> 00:56:06.740
You'll notice they look a
lot less complex than some

00:56:06.740 --> 00:56:07.710
of these other ones.

00:56:07.710 --> 00:56:09.330
And they're also
much lower frequency.

00:56:09.330 --> 00:56:11.300
So you will have a really
hard time hearing these,

00:56:11.300 --> 00:56:13.216
even though again, they're
sped up four times.

00:56:20.370 --> 00:56:23.590
It's much simpler,
and quite a bit lower.

00:56:23.590 --> 00:56:26.695
So like I said, these
songs, as far as we know,

00:56:26.695 --> 00:56:29.070
we believe that they're produced
primarily or exclusively

00:56:29.070 --> 00:56:29.700
by males.

00:56:29.700 --> 00:56:31.640
We know that it's true
for the blue whales

00:56:31.640 --> 00:56:34.540
off the Northeast in
the Northeast Pacific.

00:56:34.540 --> 00:56:37.580
So we're assuming they have
some sort of a mating function.

00:56:37.580 --> 00:56:42.500
But the details are of that
a still a little bit unsure.

00:56:42.500 --> 00:56:45.839
Now that I've introduced
you to the whale songs,

00:56:45.839 --> 00:56:47.880
I want to tell you a little
bit about the whaling

00:56:47.880 --> 00:56:51.980
and the management of
whales kind of worldwide,

00:56:51.980 --> 00:56:54.860
because I think it's a very
interesting and informative

00:56:54.860 --> 00:56:55.934
story.

00:56:55.934 --> 00:56:57.600
So, the International
Whaling Commission

00:56:57.600 --> 00:56:59.110
is the international
organization

00:56:59.110 --> 00:57:04.630
that was founded in 1946, when
the whale populations worldwide

00:57:04.630 --> 00:57:08.150
were in heavy declines with the
goal of managing the whaling so

00:57:08.150 --> 00:57:10.860
that they can continue
whaling for a long time.

00:57:10.860 --> 00:57:14.840
And as their system
of management,

00:57:14.840 --> 00:57:17.130
they had a quota system
where each country,

00:57:17.130 --> 00:57:19.420
each whaling country was
assigned a certain number

00:57:19.420 --> 00:57:20.474
of blue whale units.

00:57:20.474 --> 00:57:22.640
Now, a blue whale unit is
a very interesting measure

00:57:22.640 --> 00:57:25.580
because it's a measure
of how much oil you

00:57:25.580 --> 00:57:26.700
get from the whale.

00:57:26.700 --> 00:57:30.160
And so one blue whale
unit was one blue whale

00:57:30.160 --> 00:57:34.041
or it was a two fin whales, 2
and 1/2 humpbacks, or six sei

00:57:34.041 --> 00:57:34.540
whales.

00:57:34.540 --> 00:57:37.235
So each country would get a
certain number of blue whale

00:57:37.235 --> 00:57:39.610
units, and they could catch
it in any kind of combination

00:57:39.610 --> 00:57:41.260
of all these different species.

00:57:41.260 --> 00:57:43.470
And so what that
contributed to was

00:57:43.470 --> 00:57:50.260
quite a rapid kind of
successive depletion

00:57:50.260 --> 00:57:51.480
of all the different species.

00:57:51.480 --> 00:57:54.240
Because the whalers
could just keep going out

00:57:54.240 --> 00:57:56.630
and collecting
whatever they found.

00:57:56.630 --> 00:57:59.320
But as the blue whales were
becoming more and more rare,

00:57:59.320 --> 00:58:01.028
whenever they found
one, they would still

00:58:01.028 --> 00:58:03.660
catch it, because it was
quite valuable to catch them.

00:58:03.660 --> 00:58:06.020
Until finally in
1966, their numbers

00:58:06.020 --> 00:58:09.320
had dropped so much that they
became protected worldwide.

00:58:09.320 --> 00:58:12.370
It took another 20 years for
a global whaling moratorium

00:58:12.370 --> 00:58:14.740
to come into place, because
all of the populations

00:58:14.740 --> 00:58:15.750
kept decreasing.

00:58:15.750 --> 00:58:18.260
And since then the
IWC has been tasked,

00:58:18.260 --> 00:58:20.500
not just with
management of whaling,

00:58:20.500 --> 00:58:23.430
but also has expanded its
mission to conservation

00:58:23.430 --> 00:58:25.860
of whales themselves.

00:58:25.860 --> 00:58:28.600
So currently, one
of the major things

00:58:28.600 --> 00:58:30.780
that they are
interested in working on

00:58:30.780 --> 00:58:35.400
is stock assessment as
a part of understanding

00:58:35.400 --> 00:58:38.110
of how the populations are
recovering post whaling.

00:58:38.110 --> 00:58:41.760
But then also to be able to do
this kind of stock assessment,

00:58:41.760 --> 00:58:44.670
we really need to know a lot
more about the population

00:58:44.670 --> 00:58:46.040
structure of animals.

00:58:46.040 --> 00:58:49.740
So over the years, they go
through different species

00:58:49.740 --> 00:58:52.180
and different stocks and
try to understand and use

00:58:52.180 --> 00:58:56.150
the available scientific
information to delineate

00:58:56.150 --> 00:59:00.430
and then get a better sense
of how to properly assess

00:59:00.430 --> 00:59:02.960
these stocks and populations.

00:59:02.960 --> 00:59:06.690
And so the current focus are
the pygmy blue whales, so

00:59:06.690 --> 00:59:11.150
these smaller, chubbier
Southern hemisphere animals.

00:59:11.150 --> 00:59:13.276
And just last week,
I was actually

00:59:13.276 --> 00:59:15.900
at the meeting of the scientific
committee of the International

00:59:15.900 --> 00:59:19.980
Whaling Commission where a
large variety of scientists

00:59:19.980 --> 00:59:22.305
were brought in to
provide information

00:59:22.305 --> 00:59:26.810
and all kind of best known
available science on genetics

00:59:26.810 --> 00:59:29.430
and acoustics of these
two species to try

00:59:29.430 --> 00:59:33.520
is to help form a picture of
how these populations look.

00:59:33.520 --> 00:59:36.750
So what I'm showing you here,
the map on the bottom, this

00:59:36.750 --> 00:59:38.930
is the map of all
the locations where

00:59:38.930 --> 00:59:42.190
genetic samples, so basically
tissues of blue whales

00:59:42.190 --> 00:59:44.520
are available to do
genetic analysis,

00:59:44.520 --> 00:59:48.546
to compare genetic difference
between the pygmy blue whales.

00:59:48.546 --> 00:59:49.920
And so there's a
lot of data that

00:59:49.920 --> 00:59:52.460
were collected off of Chile.

00:59:52.460 --> 00:59:55.330
In the Indian Ocean, there
are some of Madagascar, South

00:59:55.330 --> 00:59:57.510
Africa, a little
bit here of India,

00:59:57.510 --> 01:00:01.790
but most samples really come
from waters off Australia.

01:00:01.790 --> 01:00:06.620
And when doing
meta data analysis,

01:00:06.620 --> 01:00:12.660
they just found that the
populations in the Indian Ocean

01:00:12.660 --> 01:00:16.070
and off Chile are actually
as different from each other

01:00:16.070 --> 01:00:19.280
as this pygmy blue whale that I
told you, the subspecies exist

01:00:19.280 --> 01:00:20.980
that is from the
Indian Ocean, is

01:00:20.980 --> 01:00:22.560
from the Antarctic subspecies.

01:00:22.560 --> 01:00:26.480
So there is genetic evidence to
say that the Chilean population

01:00:26.480 --> 01:00:28.890
should be its own subspecies.

01:00:28.890 --> 01:00:31.400
But then we also
looked at acoustics

01:00:31.400 --> 01:00:34.620
and how do the different
acoustic stocks map

01:00:34.620 --> 01:00:36.540
into this genetic variability?

01:00:36.540 --> 01:00:38.270
And what we find--
so again, this

01:00:38.270 --> 01:00:41.520
is now a map of all the places
where different blue whale

01:00:41.520 --> 01:00:43.960
songs were recorded in
the Southern hemisphere.

01:00:43.960 --> 01:00:47.610
And different symbols
are different song types.

01:00:47.610 --> 01:00:50.300
And you'll see that there
is actually a lot more data

01:00:50.300 --> 01:00:53.140
that we have than they've
had in the genetic data.

01:00:53.140 --> 01:00:56.950
And what we have found
is that-- so this

01:00:56.950 --> 01:00:59.830
is an update of the work that
McDonald and colleagues did

01:00:59.830 --> 01:01:01.110
before.

01:01:01.110 --> 01:01:03.140
And we have found that
in a lot of these places,

01:01:03.140 --> 01:01:05.140
their initial maps and
hypotheses were actually

01:01:05.140 --> 01:01:08.410
pretty good in terms of where
the animals occur that sing

01:01:08.410 --> 01:01:09.790
these particular songs.

01:01:09.790 --> 01:01:13.400
But then interestingly,
here off Chile,

01:01:13.400 --> 01:01:15.430
we do have two different
song types that

01:01:15.430 --> 01:01:18.000
occur at the same times
and places at all times,

01:01:18.000 --> 01:01:20.660
and they match that
genetic population

01:01:20.660 --> 01:01:23.180
that is distinct from
the Indian Ocean.

01:01:23.180 --> 01:01:25.410
But based on our data
in the Indian Ocean,

01:01:25.410 --> 01:01:28.240
we have at least three
different populations,

01:01:28.240 --> 01:01:30.350
acoustic populations,
if you will for now.

01:01:30.350 --> 01:01:33.990
So there is the turquoise
diamonds, the red triangles,

01:01:33.990 --> 01:01:37.060
and the red triangles is that
an Australian song, and then

01:01:37.060 --> 01:01:39.532
the yellow crosses.

01:01:39.532 --> 01:01:41.490
There's also this little
other diamond up here,

01:01:41.490 --> 01:01:43.810
but that is a new song
type that hasn't quite

01:01:43.810 --> 01:01:46.820
been confirmed if it's a blue
whale or not but likely is.

01:01:46.820 --> 01:01:49.860
And what you can see when you
map the places and times when

01:01:49.860 --> 01:01:52.850
these different songs occur, is
that Eastern and Western Indian

01:01:52.850 --> 01:01:56.600
Ocean songs are distinct and
occur at different places.

01:01:56.600 --> 01:01:59.910
Northern Indian song is
also different from them,

01:01:59.910 --> 01:02:02.010
and it's also
spatially separated.

01:02:02.010 --> 01:02:04.070
And there's this area in
the Central Indian Ocean

01:02:04.070 --> 01:02:06.190
where there is some
overlap between the songs.

01:02:06.190 --> 01:02:08.940
But Northern Indian Ocean song
is never there at the same time

01:02:08.940 --> 01:02:10.960
when the Southern
songs are there.

01:02:10.960 --> 01:02:15.480
And so what the geneticists have
said, seeing this information

01:02:15.480 --> 01:02:18.780
is, well OK, we really don't
have very much data here

01:02:18.780 --> 01:02:20.670
from the Western Indian Ocean.

01:02:20.670 --> 01:02:22.470
But based on this
information so far,

01:02:22.470 --> 01:02:25.710
we have reason to think that the
population of Australia and off

01:02:25.710 --> 01:02:27.550
of Madagascar
could be different.

01:02:27.550 --> 01:02:29.420
So one of the outcomes
of the meeting

01:02:29.420 --> 01:02:32.110
is for a recommendation
that was put forward

01:02:32.110 --> 01:02:33.960
that there should be
more data collected,

01:02:33.960 --> 01:02:37.024
genetic data collected, in
the Western Indian Ocean

01:02:37.024 --> 01:02:38.440
so that the
comparison of genetics

01:02:38.440 --> 01:02:41.370
can be done between these
two populations to see if

01:02:41.370 --> 01:02:44.440
and how different
they actually are.

01:02:44.440 --> 01:02:49.070
At the same time, it was also
useful for the acoustics people

01:02:49.070 --> 01:02:52.300
in the crowd to talk to
geneticists, because what

01:02:52.300 --> 01:02:54.680
we found-- from
genetic data also

01:02:54.680 --> 01:02:57.470
they found of the
animals off of Australia

01:02:57.470 --> 01:03:00.470
and New Zealand in
the small samples

01:03:00.470 --> 01:03:03.970
that they currently have, there
aren't genetic differences

01:03:03.970 --> 01:03:05.834
necessarily that are obvious.

01:03:05.834 --> 01:03:07.500
And when you talk to
geneticists they'll

01:03:07.500 --> 01:03:09.470
give you different answers
to how strongly they

01:03:09.470 --> 01:03:12.190
believe that indicates
that those are really

01:03:12.190 --> 01:03:15.890
indeed same populations
or same substocks.

01:03:15.890 --> 01:03:19.290
But geneticists have
actually really good ways

01:03:19.290 --> 01:03:22.020
of looking quantitatively
at difference

01:03:22.020 --> 01:03:24.930
between the DNA of animals.

01:03:24.930 --> 01:03:27.240
And what we have done
so far as a community,

01:03:27.240 --> 01:03:28.799
as an acoustics
community, is look

01:03:28.799 --> 01:03:31.090
at more of the differences
in song in a qualitative way

01:03:31.090 --> 01:03:33.050
to delineate these
different things.

01:03:33.050 --> 01:03:34.940
So by working with
geneticists, there's

01:03:34.940 --> 01:03:37.437
hope that we can develop
more quantitative tools

01:03:37.437 --> 01:03:39.520
to compare how different
these songs actually are.

01:03:39.520 --> 01:03:41.912
Because if you remember when
I played you these songs,

01:03:41.912 --> 01:03:43.370
a couple of them
were very similar.

01:03:43.370 --> 01:03:46.300
And some of these songs here
in the Southern hemisphere,

01:03:46.300 --> 01:03:47.860
they're quite similar
to each other.

01:03:47.860 --> 01:03:50.070
But they're very different
from the Antarctic song,

01:03:50.070 --> 01:03:52.150
and they're very different from
some of the Northern hemisphere

01:03:52.150 --> 01:03:52.840
songs.

01:03:52.840 --> 01:03:55.460
So if we can measure
the amount of difference

01:03:55.460 --> 01:03:58.490
in songs of different
populations,

01:03:58.490 --> 01:04:01.150
we could also form
more refined hypotheses

01:04:01.150 --> 01:04:02.900
and how likely they
are to actually

01:04:02.900 --> 01:04:05.810
be difference of populations.

01:04:05.810 --> 01:04:07.840
So that's kind of a
large scale story.

01:04:07.840 --> 01:04:11.290
On a finer scale
story, by looking

01:04:11.290 --> 01:04:13.830
at some of the song variability
in the North Pacific,

01:04:13.830 --> 01:04:17.270
we have found that even one song
that we thought was the same

01:04:17.270 --> 01:04:19.120
may be not quite true.

01:04:19.120 --> 01:04:22.230
So here I'm showing you,
this is the first song

01:04:22.230 --> 01:04:24.660
that I played you, the
tonal part of it in Southern

01:04:24.660 --> 01:04:27.940
California and off of Alaska
that we record regularly.

01:04:27.940 --> 01:04:30.840
And by visual
inspection, if you've

01:04:30.840 --> 01:04:33.140
seen enough of
these at least, it

01:04:33.140 --> 01:04:35.530
becomes apparent that there
is this little kink here

01:04:35.530 --> 01:04:37.900
in the Gulf of Alaska
song, where the frequencies

01:04:37.900 --> 01:04:39.450
get kind of steps down a bit.

01:04:39.450 --> 01:04:42.080
And so when we looked at this
in a little bit more detail,

01:04:42.080 --> 01:04:44.740
we found that in
fact-- so this is now

01:04:44.740 --> 01:04:47.630
from many measured calls
in the Gulf of Alaska

01:04:47.630 --> 01:04:50.640
and Southern California over
a couple of different years.

01:04:50.640 --> 01:04:53.710
We find that, in fact, the
step in the Gulf of Alaska

01:04:53.710 --> 01:04:56.650
is much more prominent than
it is in Southern California.

01:04:56.650 --> 01:04:59.280
But the question is, is
that really important

01:04:59.280 --> 01:05:01.450
and how does it
matter to the whales?

01:05:01.450 --> 01:05:03.620
Now we don't quite
know that yet.

01:05:03.620 --> 01:05:07.410
But what we do see is in
addition to this step-- now

01:05:07.410 --> 01:05:10.340
I've put this in
the same y axis here

01:05:10.340 --> 01:05:13.200
and you'll notice that this
call is much higher frequency

01:05:13.200 --> 01:05:14.110
than that call.

01:05:14.110 --> 01:05:16.610
It's about one and one
half Hertz difference,

01:05:16.610 --> 01:05:18.840
which may seem trivial.

01:05:18.840 --> 01:05:21.430
However, we know that
blue whales actually

01:05:21.430 --> 01:05:23.700
slowly over time are
decreasing their frequency.

01:05:23.700 --> 01:05:26.580
Their calls are getting
lower and lower pitched.

01:05:26.580 --> 01:05:29.960
And the difference between
these two call types

01:05:29.960 --> 01:05:32.960
is about eight years
of frequency shift.

01:05:32.960 --> 01:05:36.610
So that makes me think that
these guys are actually

01:05:36.610 --> 01:05:38.530
separate and they're
not necessarily

01:05:38.530 --> 01:05:42.030
communicating with each other,
at least in the same way.

01:05:42.030 --> 01:05:46.940
So I think we've made
some good progress

01:05:46.940 --> 01:05:50.770
in using these large scale
distinctions in a song

01:05:50.770 --> 01:05:52.729
to get some idea of
population variability.

01:05:52.729 --> 01:05:54.270
But we're really
getting to the point

01:05:54.270 --> 01:05:57.070
where we can think of some
finer scale differences

01:05:57.070 --> 01:06:02.310
and how much difference in
population they may imply.

01:06:02.310 --> 01:06:04.060
Also does this
particular [INAUDIBLE]

01:06:04.060 --> 01:06:09.520
I told you about Northeast
Pacific song difference is

01:06:09.520 --> 01:06:12.120
interesting or relevant
because we have known

01:06:12.120 --> 01:06:13.830
that the global
population of California

01:06:13.830 --> 01:06:15.620
has been stable for
the last 20 years

01:06:15.620 --> 01:06:18.911
or so, which is not quite what
people expect because they're

01:06:18.911 --> 01:06:21.160
supposed to be increasing
and recovering from whaling.

01:06:21.160 --> 01:06:24.470
And one of the ongoing
questions is, why are they not?

01:06:24.470 --> 01:06:28.660
And it's possible that they're
expanding their range, which

01:06:28.660 --> 01:06:31.410
is kind of the going
hypothesis as they're just

01:06:31.410 --> 01:06:32.800
moving to different areas.

01:06:32.800 --> 01:06:34.590
But these differences
in songs may

01:06:34.590 --> 01:06:36.717
indicate that that's not
entirely the whole story,

01:06:36.717 --> 01:06:38.675
that it might be something
else going on there,

01:06:38.675 --> 01:06:41.540
that these maybe are somehow
different populations.

01:06:41.540 --> 01:06:43.510
So the next challenge
for us is going

01:06:43.510 --> 01:06:46.707
to be to figure out how to use
these acoustics to actually do

01:06:46.707 --> 01:06:47.540
abundance estimates.

01:06:47.540 --> 01:06:50.300
This is one thing that's really
important for the managers,

01:06:50.300 --> 01:06:53.930
both from the Navy perspective
but also in the International

01:06:53.930 --> 01:06:56.660
Whaling Commission
community to be

01:06:56.660 --> 01:07:01.320
able to enhance the application
of these data further.

01:07:01.320 --> 01:07:05.870
So next, I'm going to
shift gears altogether,

01:07:05.870 --> 01:07:09.950
and I want to talk about another
group of animals that is just

01:07:09.950 --> 01:07:11.920
as commercially
important, and I would

01:07:11.920 --> 01:07:14.455
argue, maybe close to
being as charismatic,

01:07:14.455 --> 01:07:17.740
which are groupers.

01:07:17.740 --> 01:07:20.010
They are really charismatic.

01:07:20.010 --> 01:07:21.480
Nassau grouper for
example, they're

01:07:21.480 --> 01:07:23.310
famous for being very friendly.

01:07:23.310 --> 01:07:25.432
Divers love them, because
if you go on a reef,

01:07:25.432 --> 01:07:26.390
they'll come up to you.

01:07:26.390 --> 01:07:27.550
They're this huge fish.

01:07:27.550 --> 01:07:29.591
It's an impressive experience
if you ever had it.

01:07:29.591 --> 01:07:32.430
It's as impressive as it is to
see a blue whale in the ocean.

01:07:32.430 --> 01:07:34.596
it's just as impressive to
have a giant fish come up

01:07:34.596 --> 01:07:35.990
to your face and say hello.

01:07:35.990 --> 01:07:37.240
[INAUDIBLE]

01:07:37.240 --> 01:07:40.260
They're about five, I
think, five, six feet long.

01:07:40.260 --> 01:07:43.440
They can be pretty a big fish.

01:07:43.440 --> 01:07:46.090
And so, they're ecologically
important on reefs

01:07:46.090 --> 01:07:48.680
because they are
voracious predators.

01:07:48.680 --> 01:07:52.900
They are the top down
control to the reefs.

01:07:52.900 --> 01:07:56.230
They're commercially important
because they're very tasty.

01:07:56.230 --> 01:07:58.140
And they also have
this recreational value

01:07:58.140 --> 01:08:00.000
because people like
seeing them on the reefs

01:08:00.000 --> 01:08:01.985
and like swimming with them.

01:08:01.985 --> 01:08:03.360
There's a number
of other species

01:08:03.360 --> 01:08:06.190
of groupers that are common,
found through the Atlantic

01:08:06.190 --> 01:08:08.050
and in the reefs
of the Atlantic.

01:08:08.050 --> 01:08:12.280
But many of groupers, they
have this unfortunate spawning

01:08:12.280 --> 01:08:15.905
behavior where fish from all
around will come and aggregate

01:08:15.905 --> 01:08:19.529
in one place at a very
predictable time, every year,

01:08:19.529 --> 01:08:21.235
same place, same time to spawn.

01:08:21.235 --> 01:08:22.609
They will make
these aggregations

01:08:22.609 --> 01:08:25.575
of thousands of fish,
which then make them very

01:08:25.575 --> 01:08:26.700
susceptible to overfishing.

01:08:26.700 --> 01:08:29.189
Because if you're a fisherman,
you know the fish are there,

01:08:29.189 --> 01:08:30.920
you drop your hook
and line and you

01:08:30.920 --> 01:08:34.620
can decimate that population
in a matter of days.

01:08:34.620 --> 01:08:39.319
Now luckily for me, these
guys make also lots of sounds.

01:08:39.319 --> 01:08:42.100
So let me show you
what they sound like.

01:08:42.100 --> 01:08:44.570
[CLICKING AND GROANING SOUNDS]

01:08:52.773 --> 01:08:54.189
So that was a Red
hind group where

01:08:54.189 --> 01:08:57.005
they very common in
the site in the Caymans

01:08:57.005 --> 01:08:58.046
where we've been working.

01:08:58.046 --> 01:09:01.350
[CLICKING AND GROANING SOUNDS]

01:09:01.350 --> 01:09:02.350
That's a Nassau grouper.

01:09:02.350 --> 01:09:05.460
They're a little bit grumpier.

01:09:05.460 --> 01:09:08.990
So, what we have been doing
in the last couple of years

01:09:08.990 --> 01:09:12.540
is working on
Little Cayman, this

01:09:12.540 --> 01:09:14.170
is actually a very
special place,

01:09:14.170 --> 01:09:18.080
where a new, well new
to humans, aggregation,

01:09:18.080 --> 01:09:21.109
spawning aggregation was
discovered in the early 2000s.

01:09:21.109 --> 01:09:23.729
So the Caymans are
a three island chain

01:09:23.729 --> 01:09:26.149
in the middle of the
Caribbean, just South of Cuba.

01:09:26.149 --> 01:09:29.010
And Little Cayman is
the smallest of them.

01:09:29.010 --> 01:09:31.370
And here on the west
side, in early 2000s,

01:09:31.370 --> 01:09:34.760
the fishermen discovered a
previously unknown spawning

01:09:34.760 --> 01:09:35.590
aggregation.

01:09:35.590 --> 01:09:36.960
They started fishing it hard.

01:09:36.960 --> 01:09:38.279
The numbers plummeted.

01:09:38.279 --> 01:09:40.840
Caymanian government
however, stepped in,

01:09:40.840 --> 01:09:44.069
stopped fishing, and
started encouraging research

01:09:44.069 --> 01:09:48.180
in this location to
learn more about how

01:09:48.180 --> 01:09:50.430
we can protect these
animals so that we

01:09:50.430 --> 01:09:54.130
can have sustainable fishery
and keep them under reefs.

01:09:54.130 --> 01:09:57.890
And in the time since, in
the last 10 or 12 years,

01:09:57.890 --> 01:09:59.740
the Grouper Moon
Project has been

01:09:59.740 --> 01:10:01.400
composed of a
variety of scientists

01:10:01.400 --> 01:10:04.290
who have gone out and
done numerous dives

01:10:04.290 --> 01:10:07.310
on and around the spawning site
to study more and understand

01:10:07.310 --> 01:10:10.070
better the spawning
biology, the interchange

01:10:10.070 --> 01:10:12.100
of different populations
and things like that.

01:10:12.100 --> 01:10:14.850
We joined them a
year and a half ago

01:10:14.850 --> 01:10:18.930
and put recorders down,
because prior to us

01:10:18.930 --> 01:10:22.910
joining the-- so the
groupers spawn at dusk.

01:10:22.910 --> 01:10:25.700
And the divers would go down,
observe spawning events,

01:10:25.700 --> 01:10:27.040
but then it would get dark.

01:10:27.040 --> 01:10:29.940
So we didn't really
know how much longer.

01:10:29.940 --> 01:10:31.927
Does the spawning just
happen during that time?

01:10:31.927 --> 01:10:33.260
What did the fish do afterwards?

01:10:33.260 --> 01:10:34.330
Did they disperse?

01:10:34.330 --> 01:10:36.210
Are they still in the
same spot on the reef?

01:10:36.210 --> 01:10:40.380
Kind of the dynamics of the
movements were highly unknown.

01:10:40.380 --> 01:10:43.870
So we put a number of
recorders at the site,

01:10:43.870 --> 01:10:47.670
had all kinds of misfortunes
and adventures in doing so.

01:10:47.670 --> 01:10:49.760
But we've had some
really exciting data

01:10:49.760 --> 01:10:51.950
and really interesting things.

01:10:51.950 --> 01:10:54.290
And this is mostly work
that my student, Casey,

01:10:54.290 --> 01:10:56.710
has been pushing through on.

01:10:56.710 --> 01:10:58.680
And so one of the
approaches that we took

01:10:58.680 --> 01:11:01.710
is using what's called
soundscape analysis, which

01:11:01.710 --> 01:11:03.510
is kind of this large
scale of looking

01:11:03.510 --> 01:11:07.260
at the whole spectrum of sounds,
and trying to divide it up

01:11:07.260 --> 01:11:10.330
into different bands
that are of interest.

01:11:10.330 --> 01:11:13.159
And so what she has done,
you can see here again,

01:11:13.159 --> 01:11:14.950
these are spectrograms
of different grouper

01:11:14.950 --> 01:11:16.450
sounds in the top panel.

01:11:16.450 --> 01:11:18.260
And you can see
there's a lot of energy

01:11:18.260 --> 01:11:21.917
in most of these calls up
the few hundred Hertz range.

01:11:21.917 --> 01:11:24.500
Once you get lower, even though
there's a lot of call activity

01:11:24.500 --> 01:11:26.666
there as well there's a lot
of anthropogenic sounds.

01:11:26.666 --> 01:11:30.250
So she was looking for a
fine balance between the two.

01:11:30.250 --> 01:11:33.950
And then at higher frequency,
we get a lot of other fish

01:11:33.950 --> 01:11:36.650
sounds, a lot of naturally
squirrel fish, which

01:11:36.650 --> 01:11:38.480
are quite abundant on the reef.

01:11:38.480 --> 01:11:40.240
And so what she has
done is gone through

01:11:40.240 --> 01:11:41.780
and measured five
minutes and then

01:11:41.780 --> 01:11:44.150
one hour averages
of sound levels

01:11:44.150 --> 01:11:46.550
for these two frequency
bands over the times

01:11:46.550 --> 01:11:48.240
of our whole deployments.

01:11:48.240 --> 01:11:52.000
And first what we looked
at is how do the fish daily

01:11:52.000 --> 01:11:54.710
soundscape change
during the first period

01:11:54.710 --> 01:11:56.770
we had recorders out in 2015.

01:11:56.770 --> 01:11:59.680
So just as a cue, I'm using
a little picture of Nassau,

01:11:59.680 --> 01:12:04.080
as the Serranidae as the
grouper band descripter

01:12:04.080 --> 01:12:07.510
and then this is our
little squirrel fish that

01:12:07.510 --> 01:12:09.660
is representing other fish.

01:12:09.660 --> 01:12:13.140
And so on these plots, this
is about six days of data,

01:12:13.140 --> 01:12:16.900
the gray shaded boxes
represent nighttime.

01:12:16.900 --> 01:12:19.220
And what you can see
there is the blue

01:12:19.220 --> 01:12:21.560
is the five minute
averages, and the black

01:12:21.560 --> 01:12:22.990
is the one hour averages.

01:12:22.990 --> 01:12:25.820
So you see there's a lot
of variability from five

01:12:25.820 --> 01:12:27.220
minute to five minute interval.

01:12:27.220 --> 01:12:29.650
But when you sum
over that, there

01:12:29.650 --> 01:12:35.519
is a bit of a nocturnal
peak just at about sunset.

01:12:35.519 --> 01:12:37.560
But I should also point
out that during this year

01:12:37.560 --> 01:12:40.830
at this particular site, Nassau
grouper spawning occurred

01:12:40.830 --> 01:12:43.600
on these two nights, and then
back here in these last three

01:12:43.600 --> 01:12:46.120
nights, it was tiger
grouper spawning period.

01:12:46.120 --> 01:12:48.370
And you can see that during
the tiger spawning grouper

01:12:48.370 --> 01:12:52.890
particular, there is a little
bit stronger signals because we

01:12:52.890 --> 01:12:55.140
actually had more tiger
grouper on our particular site

01:12:55.140 --> 01:12:56.100
this year.

01:12:56.100 --> 01:12:58.452
But you see some of
these daily patterns.

01:12:58.452 --> 01:12:59.910
Same is true for
the squirrel fish,

01:12:59.910 --> 01:13:02.290
but they have a very
clear corpuscular pattern

01:13:02.290 --> 01:13:07.740
with peaks at dusk and dawn
and relatively lower levels

01:13:07.740 --> 01:13:09.230
during the day.

01:13:09.230 --> 01:13:11.800
Now in addition to the
daily cycle in calls,

01:13:11.800 --> 01:13:17.080
there's also changes
in the local activity

01:13:17.080 --> 01:13:18.460
with lunar phase.

01:13:18.460 --> 01:13:20.740
Spawning often happens,
or generally happens,

01:13:20.740 --> 01:13:25.770
sometime around usually a
few days after a new moon.

01:13:25.770 --> 01:13:30.220
And so here I'm showing
six days at a period

01:13:30.220 --> 01:13:33.400
in between the moon phases.

01:13:33.400 --> 01:13:37.340
This plot is the new moon and
this plot shows the full moon

01:13:37.340 --> 01:13:38.260
time period.

01:13:38.260 --> 01:13:41.180
And what I just want you
to take home from this

01:13:41.180 --> 01:13:43.600
is that the average level,
so basically average noise

01:13:43.600 --> 01:13:48.260
of this band of grouper sounds
is substantially higher.

01:13:48.260 --> 01:13:51.710
Two to three DB, while it
doesn't sound much this

01:13:51.710 --> 01:13:53.130
is a logarithmic scale.

01:13:53.130 --> 01:13:56.810
So it's actually quite
a substantial increase

01:13:56.810 --> 01:13:58.770
during the new and full moons.

01:13:58.770 --> 01:14:00.740
So the animals are
a lot more active

01:14:00.740 --> 01:14:03.470
during those other times.

01:14:03.470 --> 01:14:08.570
We found the same pattern for
the squirrel fish as well.

01:14:08.570 --> 01:14:10.400
But then what we
really want to know

01:14:10.400 --> 01:14:13.340
is, do these metrics
actually represent fish?

01:14:13.340 --> 01:14:18.450
Can we certainly say that these
are fish that we are detecting?

01:14:18.450 --> 01:14:20.860
And so what Casey has
done is gone through

01:14:20.860 --> 01:14:24.020
and logged painfully all
of the calls that have

01:14:24.020 --> 01:14:26.770
occurred over those six days.

01:14:26.770 --> 01:14:31.810
And that was about 20,000
calls that she's gone through.

01:14:31.810 --> 01:14:33.490
They're basically
identified by species.

01:14:33.490 --> 01:14:36.500
A lot of them are Red hinds,
but we have quite a variety

01:14:36.500 --> 01:14:37.900
of animals in there.

01:14:37.900 --> 01:14:41.520
And the blue line here
in both of these plots

01:14:41.520 --> 01:14:44.680
show the number of
calls at any given hour.

01:14:44.680 --> 01:14:47.410
And then the black is still
the soundscape metric.

01:14:47.410 --> 01:14:52.380
And you'll notice, when doing
cross correlations in these,

01:14:52.380 --> 01:14:55.990
you see that [INAUDIBLE] are
relationship between the two.

01:14:55.990 --> 01:14:58.080
So there is some
indication that they

01:14:58.080 --> 01:15:01.930
are good proxies, these metrics
that you can compute rapidly

01:15:01.930 --> 01:15:03.590
are good proxies.

01:15:03.590 --> 01:15:05.480
Specifically here
during the time

01:15:05.480 --> 01:15:07.680
when we had peak
tiger spawning period,

01:15:07.680 --> 01:15:12.610
you can see that these
increases in number of calls

01:15:12.610 --> 01:15:14.460
match quite nicely
with increases

01:15:14.460 --> 01:15:16.293
with our acoustic level,
so we're definitely

01:15:16.293 --> 01:15:20.090
do a good job measuring
tiger grouper presence.

01:15:20.090 --> 01:15:22.577
But so in addition, while
we had all these calls, what

01:15:22.577 --> 01:15:24.660
I didn't mention right
away is that we didn't just

01:15:24.660 --> 01:15:25.701
have one recorder either.

01:15:25.701 --> 01:15:27.190
We had multiple recorders.

01:15:27.190 --> 01:15:30.570
We had up to four
to five recorders

01:15:30.570 --> 01:15:32.710
simultaneously
collecting this data

01:15:32.710 --> 01:15:39.040
in an array that was about
50 meter by 50 meter large.

01:15:39.040 --> 01:15:41.750
And so what you can
do when you have

01:15:41.750 --> 01:15:43.850
that kind of a
setup is if you hear

01:15:43.850 --> 01:15:46.030
the same sound of
multiple instruments,

01:15:46.030 --> 01:15:49.040
you can use the
difference in the time

01:15:49.040 --> 01:15:52.760
of the arrival of that same
signal to multiple locations

01:15:52.760 --> 01:15:55.440
to localize where the sound
is actually coming from.

01:15:55.440 --> 01:15:58.250
And so the process
then consists basically

01:15:58.250 --> 01:16:00.620
of finding the
sound of interest,

01:16:00.620 --> 01:16:03.690
doing some acoustic processing
where you filter it,

01:16:03.690 --> 01:16:05.520
you rectify the
signal, and then you

01:16:05.520 --> 01:16:09.550
do cross-correlation between
the two pairs of instruments.

01:16:09.550 --> 01:16:12.560
And you look for the
time delay and the peak

01:16:12.560 --> 01:16:14.110
of that cross-correlation.

01:16:14.110 --> 01:16:15.840
And that gives you
the time delay.

01:16:15.840 --> 01:16:19.460
And you'll notice here,
this is time in seconds.

01:16:19.460 --> 01:16:21.640
So our peak is just slightly
off or off from zero.

01:16:21.640 --> 01:16:23.200
So this is a small array.

01:16:23.200 --> 01:16:26.580
We're looking at very,
very small time differences

01:16:26.580 --> 01:16:29.160
because we are localizing
in a very small time scale.

01:16:29.160 --> 01:16:33.220
But what you get once you have
this time delay with any two

01:16:33.220 --> 01:16:36.760
instruments, what that gives
you is this hyperbolic solution.

01:16:36.760 --> 01:16:40.520
So it's a hyperbola along which
that sound may have occurred.

01:16:40.520 --> 01:16:43.140
And then if you
have multiple pairs,

01:16:43.140 --> 01:16:45.000
you get multiple
hyperbole, and where

01:16:45.000 --> 01:16:47.760
they cross that is where
your sound is occurring.

01:16:47.760 --> 01:16:50.890
So what Casey's is in
the process of doing then

01:16:50.890 --> 01:16:54.420
is overlaying the locations
of all these different sounds

01:16:54.420 --> 01:16:57.680
that we can localize
on a map that was

01:16:57.680 --> 01:17:00.230
collected of habitat quality.

01:17:00.230 --> 01:17:05.460
So what I'm showing you
here, the black triangles

01:17:05.460 --> 01:17:08.010
are the instrument
recorder locations.

01:17:08.010 --> 01:17:10.360
And then the circles
of different colors

01:17:10.360 --> 01:17:11.660
are calls of different species.

01:17:11.660 --> 01:17:13.868
There are different call
types for different species.

01:17:13.868 --> 01:17:16.260
All the blue ones are the
Nassau and tiger calls.

01:17:16.260 --> 01:17:18.594
The red, there's a couple
of them, are the Red hind.

01:17:18.594 --> 01:17:20.260
There's also some
black grouper and some

01:17:20.260 --> 01:17:22.320
that we haven't identified
the species yet.

01:17:22.320 --> 01:17:25.030
And so you see there is
quite a few calls that

01:17:25.030 --> 01:17:25.940
have occurred here.

01:17:25.940 --> 01:17:29.910
And then underneath it, this
is the bottom, the reef.

01:17:29.910 --> 01:17:33.030
And the lighter areas
are sandy patches

01:17:33.030 --> 01:17:37.500
and then these darker parts are
coral or other hard structure.

01:17:37.500 --> 01:17:39.250
So what we're in
the process now,

01:17:39.250 --> 01:17:42.070
just kind of qualitatively
looking at this,

01:17:42.070 --> 01:17:45.170
it appears of these
intersections or kind

01:17:45.170 --> 01:17:49.890
of borderline between sand
and rough reef structure maybe

01:17:49.890 --> 01:17:51.400
really important habitat.

01:17:51.400 --> 01:17:54.760
We're in the process of
actually quantifying those call

01:17:54.760 --> 01:17:57.240
localizations and seeing
what kind of habitat

01:17:57.240 --> 01:18:00.080
different calling occurs on.

01:18:00.080 --> 01:18:03.350
So to sum up, I hope
I've convince you

01:18:03.350 --> 01:18:05.680
that acoustics can be
a really powerful tool

01:18:05.680 --> 01:18:10.520
to help us learn more about the
biology, distribution, ecology

01:18:10.520 --> 01:18:12.790
of a variety of marine animals.

01:18:12.790 --> 01:18:15.145
In particular though,
what we're finding is

01:18:15.145 --> 01:18:17.350
it's going to be very
important to understand

01:18:17.350 --> 01:18:19.600
the context of these
different calls

01:18:19.600 --> 01:18:25.482
to really go further in bringing
that context into management

01:18:25.482 --> 01:18:27.440
perspective understanding
better where and when

01:18:27.440 --> 01:18:30.470
and why the different
animals are occurring.

01:18:30.470 --> 01:18:32.780
And then I think what's
going to be important also

01:18:32.780 --> 01:18:35.080
is to continue, there's
been a lot of advances

01:18:35.080 --> 01:18:41.361
on the hardware
side and of things.

01:18:41.361 --> 01:18:43.110
But I think the future
advances are really

01:18:43.110 --> 01:18:45.080
coming in our ability
to process this data

01:18:45.080 --> 01:18:46.450
and interpret this data.

01:18:46.450 --> 01:18:48.577
And I think using
qualitative tools

01:18:48.577 --> 01:18:50.410
and combining techniques
of different fields

01:18:50.410 --> 01:18:51.701
is going to be crucial to that.

01:18:51.701 --> 01:18:53.740
So I think that's the
next exciting thing.

01:18:53.740 --> 01:18:56.290
So with that, I want to
acknowledge the funding

01:18:56.290 --> 01:18:58.255
agencies and all the
collaborators and students

01:18:58.255 --> 01:18:59.713
and I thank you
for your attention.

01:18:59.713 --> 01:19:01.468
[APPLAUSE]

01:19:05.188 --> 01:19:10.530
-So, if I could get
you to sit up here

01:19:10.530 --> 01:19:13.650
and we can take questions
from the audience.

01:19:13.650 --> 01:19:17.650
And if you don't have them,
I have some questions myself.

01:19:17.650 --> 01:19:20.670
But, yeah.

01:19:20.670 --> 01:19:22.260
You should take the microphone.

01:19:22.260 --> 01:19:24.736
-I have a question
for each speaker.

01:19:24.736 --> 01:19:25.261
Is that OK?

01:19:25.261 --> 01:19:25.760
-Yeah.

01:19:25.760 --> 01:19:28.540
-So first, Rachel,
I was just wondering

01:19:28.540 --> 01:19:31.270
you're advocating and
planning for transitioning

01:19:31.270 --> 01:19:36.330
from hard shoreline protection
to living coastline.

01:19:36.330 --> 01:19:40.490
How are you factoring
in the anticipated rise

01:19:40.490 --> 01:19:42.200
in ocean level?

01:19:42.200 --> 01:19:45.600
-Yeah, so it will
depend on where

01:19:45.600 --> 01:19:48.290
you're considering
doing living shorelines

01:19:48.290 --> 01:19:49.490
versus hard shorelines.

01:19:49.490 --> 01:19:54.060
And I will say at first, I think
we'll have a hybrid approach

01:19:54.060 --> 01:19:54.650
everywhere.

01:19:54.650 --> 01:19:57.867
So places like New
York City or Miami

01:19:57.867 --> 01:19:59.700
where you have a lot
of hard infrastructure,

01:19:59.700 --> 01:20:02.050
you're going to need some
engineering structures

01:20:02.050 --> 01:20:03.480
like floodgates.

01:20:03.480 --> 01:20:06.010
You're going to need
seawalls in some places.

01:20:06.010 --> 01:20:09.210
And the idea is to kind of
integrate the living components

01:20:09.210 --> 01:20:11.610
in with the hard infrastructure
for these really heavily

01:20:11.610 --> 01:20:16.205
urbanized areas that are going
to see a lot of sea level rise,

01:20:16.205 --> 01:20:17.790
like Miami.

01:20:17.790 --> 01:20:21.350
In some areas where we
expect in the next 100 years

01:20:21.350 --> 01:20:24.280
there to be enough for
the area to be underwater,

01:20:24.280 --> 01:20:28.800
we're essentially trying to plan
for that retreat, in the sense

01:20:28.800 --> 01:20:31.410
that a lot of these
living designs

01:20:31.410 --> 01:20:35.230
put the hard structure
seaward of the habitat

01:20:35.230 --> 01:20:38.820
they're trying to protect,
so that as you the sea

01:20:38.820 --> 01:20:41.590
level rises, those
habitats, those marshes,

01:20:41.590 --> 01:20:43.800
could actually migrate
landward without having

01:20:43.800 --> 01:20:45.960
a hard structure behind them.

01:20:45.960 --> 01:20:49.020
So that's one way that the
living shoreline approach,

01:20:49.020 --> 01:20:51.910
particularly with the off
shore kind of protection

01:20:51.910 --> 01:20:55.930
is factoring in sea
level, is that assuming

01:20:55.930 --> 01:20:58.080
that those habitats
can migrate like they

01:20:58.080 --> 01:21:00.430
would if you didn't
have any development.

01:21:00.430 --> 01:21:04.690
But again that's also assuming
that the rates of sea level

01:21:04.690 --> 01:21:07.020
don't increase too rapidly.

01:21:07.020 --> 01:21:11.055
So we still have-- there's a
lot of new research right now

01:21:11.055 --> 01:21:16.800
on using dredge material to
actually deposit sediment

01:21:16.800 --> 01:21:18.840
onto marshes like in
the Gulf Coast's that

01:21:18.840 --> 01:21:20.930
are sediment starved
and are actually sinking

01:21:20.930 --> 01:21:23.660
as sea level is rising
to help them keep up

01:21:23.660 --> 01:21:24.910
and be able to migrate.

01:21:24.910 --> 01:21:26.690
So I think we're
going to need a lot

01:21:26.690 --> 01:21:30.980
of different-- both engineering
and ecological techniques.

01:21:30.980 --> 01:21:33.790
And it's going to be
very region specific.

01:21:33.790 --> 01:21:35.690
So a it's complicated.

01:21:35.690 --> 01:21:38.440
-The other question I had is
a question I've always had

01:21:38.440 --> 01:21:40.240
and I never had a
chance to ask it before,

01:21:40.240 --> 01:21:44.080
which is, what exactly
is it about sonar that

01:21:44.080 --> 01:21:50.030
makes it deleterious to
whales and other sea life?

01:21:50.030 --> 01:21:52.050
How specifically,
physiologically

01:21:52.050 --> 01:21:53.570
does it impact the whale?

01:21:53.570 --> 01:21:56.550
-So there's several
different types of sonar.

01:21:56.550 --> 01:22:00.150
There is the low frequency
sonar that can be anywhere.

01:22:00.150 --> 01:22:02.360
It's really usually
below the kilohertz.

01:22:02.360 --> 01:22:04.160
And the mid frequency
active sonar

01:22:04.160 --> 01:22:08.840
is the one that's been
most implicated recently

01:22:08.840 --> 01:22:12.910
in the last 16, 20
years in stranding

01:22:12.910 --> 01:22:17.390
events for [? Adonisees ?] but
really a variety of species.

01:22:17.390 --> 01:22:23.000
And it's an interesting
question because the frequencies

01:22:23.000 --> 01:22:24.830
at which those
sonars are occurring

01:22:24.830 --> 01:22:28.040
are not necessarily
the same frequencies

01:22:28.040 --> 01:22:30.960
at which the animals are
producing sound, and therefore

01:22:30.960 --> 01:22:33.210
would it be reasonable to
assume that their hearing is

01:22:33.210 --> 01:22:35.520
most sensitive.

01:22:35.520 --> 01:22:40.240
But in the cases
where we have seen

01:22:40.240 --> 01:22:43.140
impact is basically in
animals that have stranded

01:22:43.140 --> 01:22:50.490
and they've had various
internal damage in air cavities

01:22:50.490 --> 01:22:52.100
and structures of that nature.

01:22:52.100 --> 01:22:59.010
So there is presumably some
resonance in the air cavities

01:22:59.010 --> 01:23:01.460
and soft tissues
resulting from the sonar.

01:23:01.460 --> 01:23:05.590
But I mean it's a lot more
complicated I think than just

01:23:05.590 --> 01:23:08.820
direct physiological
impact often,

01:23:08.820 --> 01:23:11.520
because we certainly
know there's a variety

01:23:11.520 --> 01:23:17.680
of bathometric and other
constrains that lead to some

01:23:17.680 --> 01:23:20.490
of these events, leading to
standings and others that

01:23:20.490 --> 01:23:21.270
don't.

01:23:21.270 --> 01:23:26.570
So it's a complex answer.

01:23:26.570 --> 01:23:29.480
I'm not sure that I answered
your question satisfactorily.

01:23:29.480 --> 01:23:32.115
-These changes that you see in
the dead whales, [INAUDIBLE]

01:23:39.131 --> 01:23:39.630
-The which?

01:23:39.630 --> 01:23:40.171
I'm missing--

01:23:40.171 --> 01:23:43.770
-They die [INAUDIBLE]
They die on the beach.

01:23:43.770 --> 01:23:44.270
-Right.

01:23:44.270 --> 01:23:47.620
But so sometimes,
often they'll strand

01:23:47.620 --> 01:23:50.290
or they come on the
beach because they're

01:23:50.290 --> 01:23:53.440
disoriented or
otherwise under stress

01:23:53.440 --> 01:23:57.590
and are trying to
escape whatever,

01:23:57.590 --> 01:24:00.300
move away from whatever source
is causing them distress.

01:24:00.300 --> 01:24:05.059
So they may die from
the internal injuries,

01:24:05.059 --> 01:24:06.350
but that's not always the case.

01:24:06.350 --> 01:24:08.725
Sometimes they'll just die
from the process of stranding,

01:24:08.725 --> 01:24:11.250
where they don't want to
be in the environment that

01:24:11.250 --> 01:24:14.110
is causing them stress.

01:24:14.110 --> 01:24:15.950
-Question in the back.

01:24:15.950 --> 01:24:17.820
-Yes, Dr. Gittman.

01:24:17.820 --> 01:24:23.820
This is a question about
denial of sea level rise.

01:24:23.820 --> 01:24:28.320
And I wonder what the
scientific community

01:24:28.320 --> 01:24:29.760
is going to do about this.

01:24:29.760 --> 01:24:33.660
I can hear all of the
Band-Aid approaches

01:24:33.660 --> 01:24:36.450
to dealing with
this, but my sense

01:24:36.450 --> 01:24:39.210
is that scientists
are trying to be

01:24:39.210 --> 01:24:42.790
as conservative and cautious as
they can be about the sea level

01:24:42.790 --> 01:24:44.710
rise, but it's rising.

01:24:44.710 --> 01:24:49.330
So you have at least from
the Carolinas north, just

01:24:49.330 --> 01:24:52.420
affecting the East
Coast, what will

01:24:52.420 --> 01:24:55.380
be a disaster down the
line, and band-aids

01:24:55.380 --> 01:24:57.840
aren't going to fix it.

01:24:57.840 --> 01:25:01.580
And a couple of
things there I believe

01:25:01.580 --> 01:25:04.760
it was the North
Carolina government that

01:25:04.760 --> 01:25:07.590
is in a state of
denial from hell

01:25:07.590 --> 01:25:12.470
to put it gently, much
like climate change denial.

01:25:12.470 --> 01:25:15.386
So they wouldn't
allow, what was it,

01:25:15.386 --> 01:25:18.250
a law or regulation
to go through.

01:25:18.250 --> 01:25:19.850
And I'm sure there
are one of many.

01:25:19.850 --> 01:25:23.100
I think of Miami, all
the time like this.

01:25:23.100 --> 01:25:26.840
But I can see where this is
going to be a real problem.

01:25:26.840 --> 01:25:30.710
What's your take on that, if
you want to make it public?

01:25:30.710 --> 01:25:33.820
But my real question is what
is the science community

01:25:33.820 --> 01:25:36.414
going to do because they've
got to educate people?

01:25:39.320 --> 01:25:42.190
-It is a very complicated issue.

01:25:42.190 --> 01:25:45.837
We are in a very polarized
political society right now.

01:25:45.837 --> 01:25:48.170
And I think it's gotten even
more polarized even since I

01:25:48.170 --> 01:25:50.260
started graduate school.

01:25:50.260 --> 01:25:52.180
When I started in
North Carolina,

01:25:52.180 --> 01:25:57.260
it was pre the passing of
the ban on sea level rise.

01:25:57.260 --> 01:25:59.600
And I was actually working
with the Coastal Resources

01:25:59.600 --> 01:26:01.490
Commission and with the
Division of Coastal Management

01:26:01.490 --> 01:26:02.810
and they were fairly proactive.

01:26:02.810 --> 01:26:04.820
They had a science
panel that had

01:26:04.820 --> 01:26:07.380
developed different
trajectories for sea level rise.

01:26:07.380 --> 01:26:10.640
And they were basing their
mucosal management policies

01:26:10.640 --> 01:26:12.870
on these different trajectories.

01:26:12.870 --> 01:26:15.820
And North Carolina in the '70s
was actually very progressive

01:26:15.820 --> 01:26:18.310
and they banned all shoreline
hardening on open coasts.

01:26:18.310 --> 01:26:19.980
So if you were in
North Carolina you

01:26:19.980 --> 01:26:23.550
don't see sea walls
on any of the beaches.

01:26:23.550 --> 01:26:26.120
You'll see an occasional
jetty or groin

01:26:26.120 --> 01:26:29.470
that the Army Corps built
in maybe the '40s or '50s

01:26:29.470 --> 01:26:31.900
at major inlets,
but you don't have

01:26:31.900 --> 01:26:34.916
hardening like you see in
other parts of the country.

01:26:34.916 --> 01:26:36.540
And then when I was
in graduate school,

01:26:36.540 --> 01:26:40.520
we had a change in
the political arena,

01:26:40.520 --> 01:26:44.360
and they essentially turned
over the entire Department

01:26:44.360 --> 01:26:45.400
of Natural Resources.

01:26:45.400 --> 01:26:48.430
They dismantled
the science panel.

01:26:48.430 --> 01:26:52.690
And they passed a law,
largely driven by developers,

01:26:52.690 --> 01:26:56.040
who wanted to be able to
develop in high risk areas,

01:26:56.040 --> 01:26:58.740
because it would in the short
term make them a lot of money.

01:26:58.740 --> 01:27:00.240
They said, we don't
want you to make

01:27:00.240 --> 01:27:02.530
any new law about
coastal management

01:27:02.530 --> 01:27:05.610
based on any projection
on future sea level

01:27:05.610 --> 01:27:08.630
rise it has to be based on
historic rates of sea level

01:27:08.630 --> 01:27:11.610
rise, which no climate
scientists would agree

01:27:11.610 --> 01:27:13.810
is in any way reasonable.

01:27:13.810 --> 01:27:16.870
Because the idea is that the
sea level rise is accelerating.

01:27:16.870 --> 01:27:18.250
But that was the
law they passed.

01:27:18.250 --> 01:27:21.584
And so they since have
overturned our ban

01:27:21.584 --> 01:27:23.000
on shoreline
hardening and are now

01:27:23.000 --> 01:27:25.600
allowing terminal groins,
which are basically

01:27:25.600 --> 01:27:28.320
put in place where
you have developers

01:27:28.320 --> 01:27:33.980
wanting to build in extremely
dynamic, unstable inlet areas.

01:27:33.980 --> 01:27:35.870
And they want to
have these groins put

01:27:35.870 --> 01:27:39.806
in place to protect their high
risk, high dollar developments.

01:27:39.806 --> 01:27:41.930
So, yeah, North Carolina
has gone kind of backwards

01:27:41.930 --> 01:27:45.530
since I have lived there.

01:27:45.530 --> 01:27:49.410
But the scientific
community is basically

01:27:49.410 --> 01:27:51.800
trying to do a
multifaceted approach.

01:27:51.800 --> 01:27:55.700
So we obviously, in a lot
of areas, are saying retreat

01:27:55.700 --> 01:27:57.990
is going to be the only
option in the long term.

01:27:57.990 --> 01:28:00.400
I mean you're going
to have to move away.

01:28:00.400 --> 01:28:02.330
And we're a disaster
driven society.

01:28:02.330 --> 01:28:06.530
So it will likely take events
like Sandy, like Katrina,

01:28:06.530 --> 01:28:09.090
where whole communities
are going to get wiped out,

01:28:09.090 --> 01:28:12.180
and then we're going to
choose to not rebuild.

01:28:12.180 --> 01:28:14.290
And that's a very sad
way of looking at it.

01:28:14.290 --> 01:28:16.400
But I think it's the
most likely scenario,

01:28:16.400 --> 01:28:19.220
because everything we've seen
in terms of coastal management

01:28:19.220 --> 01:28:22.300
changes has been reactionary.

01:28:22.300 --> 01:28:24.890
We are seeing more funding
post-Sandy I think,

01:28:24.890 --> 01:28:26.500
for resilience efforts.

01:28:26.500 --> 01:28:29.510
Some of the major cities
like New York, Miami,

01:28:29.510 --> 01:28:34.040
are starting to think about ways
they can plan for the future.

01:28:34.040 --> 01:28:36.874
So New York has adopted
like a long term

01:28:36.874 --> 01:28:38.290
plan for how they're
going to deal

01:28:38.290 --> 01:28:40.330
with sea level
rise that includes

01:28:40.330 --> 01:28:43.280
gray and green infrastructure.

01:28:43.280 --> 01:28:45.150
There's a design
in place right now

01:28:45.150 --> 01:28:48.450
that will actually let part
of the downtown area flood

01:28:48.450 --> 01:28:53.340
naturally and then just recede
by including kind of vegetation

01:28:53.340 --> 01:28:55.870
and a series of
floodgates, and you

01:28:55.870 --> 01:29:01.370
know it'll be a combined effort
of engineering and ecology.

01:29:01.370 --> 01:29:03.980
So I think we just
try to advocate

01:29:03.980 --> 01:29:07.200
for many different solutions
in many different phases

01:29:07.200 --> 01:29:09.430
of this process.

01:29:09.430 --> 01:29:12.930
I think if you just
preach retreat,

01:29:12.930 --> 01:29:15.760
you will only reach a small
portion of the population.

01:29:15.760 --> 01:29:19.910
So the surveys I showed in the
talk were to the 850 responses,

01:29:19.910 --> 01:29:22.610
we asked the question,
how much do you

01:29:22.610 --> 01:29:24.680
think sea level is going
to rise and how do you

01:29:24.680 --> 01:29:26.120
think it will
affect your property

01:29:26.120 --> 01:29:27.910
and what are you going to do?

01:29:27.910 --> 01:29:32.750
And most people said, I
mean the range in sea level

01:29:32.750 --> 01:29:36.130
went from zero to 100 feet.

01:29:36.130 --> 01:29:39.535
I mean people have no
idea how much sea level

01:29:39.535 --> 01:29:40.450
is going to rise.

01:29:40.450 --> 01:29:44.320
And so that's one issue is
the education component.

01:29:44.320 --> 01:29:47.370
Two, even if they said
it was going to rise,

01:29:47.370 --> 01:29:49.660
I got responses of
mostly, well, it's

01:29:49.660 --> 01:29:52.250
not going affect me it's going
to affect the next generation.

01:29:52.250 --> 01:29:54.750
Because a lot of people that
live on the waterfront in North

01:29:54.750 --> 01:29:55.860
Carolina are retirees.

01:29:55.860 --> 01:29:58.340
You know, this is where they've
retired and they're like,

01:29:58.340 --> 01:30:02.090
well, you know, my grandkids
will deal with that.

01:30:02.090 --> 01:30:05.170
And then the third part of what
are they going to do about it?

01:30:05.170 --> 01:30:08.330
Overwhelmingly, most
people said nothing.

01:30:08.330 --> 01:30:10.690
And most people said they
were willing to pay over

01:30:10.690 --> 01:30:14.110
100% increase in their insurance
even with sea level rise,

01:30:14.110 --> 01:30:16.560
so they're not willing
to move either.

01:30:16.560 --> 01:30:18.970
They're going to
pay the insurance.

01:30:18.970 --> 01:30:21.700
And so one change we may see
is that the insurance companies

01:30:21.700 --> 01:30:22.760
are starting to pull out.

01:30:22.760 --> 01:30:25.670
So in the Outer Banks
in North Carolina,

01:30:25.670 --> 01:30:28.290
they won't insure whole
stretches of shoreline.

01:30:28.290 --> 01:30:30.770
You can't rebuild based
on insurance anymore.

01:30:30.770 --> 01:30:33.630
You have to be willing to build
your house with no insurance.

01:30:33.630 --> 01:30:35.420
People still do it.

01:30:35.420 --> 01:30:39.290
But it's at least moving
in that direction.

01:30:39.290 --> 01:30:45.280
So people respond to
monetary incentives I

01:30:45.280 --> 01:30:46.610
think more than anything else.

01:30:46.610 --> 01:30:49.160
And so, once we
show that it's going

01:30:49.160 --> 01:30:50.810
to cost more than
it's worth, I think

01:30:50.810 --> 01:30:54.250
we'll start to see more retreat.

01:30:54.250 --> 01:30:56.040
-Thank you.

01:30:56.040 --> 01:31:02.350
-Until 2012, I lived on a
barrier reef, Singer Island

01:31:02.350 --> 01:31:05.040
in Florida, off West Palm.

01:31:05.040 --> 01:31:09.620
And I saw all this
and all the variations

01:31:09.620 --> 01:31:14.440
that you've described of
solutions for the shore.

01:31:14.440 --> 01:31:21.960
So when I would talk to people,
you have public access legally

01:31:21.960 --> 01:31:27.120
to the ocean in Florida,
the Atlantic coast.

01:31:27.120 --> 01:31:29.090
So I say, well, we
really shouldn't

01:31:29.090 --> 01:31:33.650
be building-- it should
be like five miles inland.

01:31:33.650 --> 01:31:35.640
And of course
that's not popular.

01:31:35.640 --> 01:31:37.520
I said, OK, well,
how about three.

01:31:37.520 --> 01:31:40.470
You know, that's
not popular either.

01:31:40.470 --> 01:31:44.850
So I understand that money
is the loudest talker

01:31:44.850 --> 01:31:48.520
and has the most
seats at the table.

01:31:48.520 --> 01:31:52.090
But going back to
education, I think

01:31:52.090 --> 01:31:56.940
the only big piece that
will ever change anything

01:31:56.940 --> 01:32:02.230
is the education of the very
youngest people now alive,

01:32:02.230 --> 01:32:07.320
our children to understand
what will happen

01:32:07.320 --> 01:32:13.630
and that they're going to take
on the mantle of stewardship.

01:32:13.630 --> 01:32:16.810
And when they've lived
with that for 20 years,

01:32:16.810 --> 01:32:20.710
they might be willing
to change and make

01:32:20.710 --> 01:32:22.680
decisions that will be good.

01:32:22.680 --> 01:32:27.830
But you won't find
people now to be

01:32:27.830 --> 01:32:29.080
willing to make those changes.

01:32:29.080 --> 01:32:35.920
So you have to work at
all those levels at once

01:32:35.920 --> 01:32:39.190
in order to hope that
in a quarter century

01:32:39.190 --> 01:32:41.358
there might be real progress.

01:32:41.358 --> 01:32:43.190
-I completely agree.

01:32:43.190 --> 01:32:45.440
One thing we are
doing-- so education

01:32:45.440 --> 01:32:48.900
is a huge component of
the work that we do.

01:32:48.900 --> 01:32:51.220
And we have like
demonstration projects,

01:32:51.220 --> 01:32:53.637
and you know I've done several
field trips out to a living

01:32:53.637 --> 01:32:54.136
shoreline.

01:32:54.136 --> 01:32:56.420
I showed a picture of the
oyster reef living shoreline

01:32:56.420 --> 01:32:58.570
that we constructed in 2012.

01:32:58.570 --> 01:33:02.310
And we bring-- this is part
of an estaurine research.

01:33:02.310 --> 01:33:04.275
So we bring children
out, we teach them

01:33:04.275 --> 01:33:05.400
about the living shoreline.

01:33:05.400 --> 01:33:09.056
But we're also still invested
in educating adults too.

01:33:09.056 --> 01:33:10.680
One of the big things
in North Carolina

01:33:10.680 --> 01:33:14.570
is to initiate-- this kind of
an under the radar Initiative

01:33:14.570 --> 01:33:18.504
that's mostly funded through
donations and through NGOs

01:33:18.504 --> 01:33:20.670
and not obviously through
our legislature right now,

01:33:20.670 --> 01:33:24.760
but is to start a
green engineering

01:33:24.760 --> 01:33:26.480
or like living
shoreline certification

01:33:26.480 --> 01:33:30.460
program for marine contractors
and engineering firms.

01:33:30.460 --> 01:33:33.130
And that's mainly because
your average homeowner

01:33:33.130 --> 01:33:36.520
will buy waterfront
property, see that's eroding,

01:33:36.520 --> 01:33:37.930
and not know what
to do about it.

01:33:37.930 --> 01:33:40.340
And they'll just look up,
they'll go into Google

01:33:40.340 --> 01:33:43.640
and find a coastal engineering
firm or a contractor,

01:33:43.640 --> 01:33:47.260
call them and say, my shoreline
is eroding, what do I do?

01:33:47.260 --> 01:33:49.780
And your average
contractor has been putting

01:33:49.780 --> 01:33:51.200
in bulkheads for three decades.

01:33:51.200 --> 01:33:52.400
And they say, well,
this is what you need.

01:33:52.400 --> 01:33:53.520
You need a bulkhead.

01:33:53.520 --> 01:33:55.430
And they say that because that's
what they know how to build

01:33:55.430 --> 01:33:57.390
and that's what's going
to cost the most money.

01:33:57.390 --> 01:33:59.389
And it also actually costs
the most maintenance,

01:33:59.389 --> 01:34:01.160
but they're not going
to tell them that.

01:34:01.160 --> 01:34:04.160
And so now I've participated
in two training sessions

01:34:04.160 --> 01:34:07.260
for real estate developers,
landscape architects, and then

01:34:07.260 --> 01:34:09.050
engineering and
contracting firms

01:34:09.050 --> 01:34:11.930
on how to build
living shorelines

01:34:11.930 --> 01:34:14.010
and how it could
potentially make them money.

01:34:14.010 --> 01:34:18.640
Because they could go back
and help maintain the plants.

01:34:18.640 --> 01:34:22.060
They can basically get free
advertising through the state,

01:34:22.060 --> 01:34:24.220
because they'll have
the certification.

01:34:24.220 --> 01:34:26.370
So there are ways
that we're trying

01:34:26.370 --> 01:34:28.700
to reach some of
the key players,

01:34:28.700 --> 01:34:31.640
but it's a slow process.

01:34:31.640 --> 01:34:34.110
Again, people are
resistant to change.

01:34:34.110 --> 01:34:37.080
But I'm still optimistic.

01:34:37.080 --> 01:34:39.480
OK, we can take a
break in a second.

01:34:39.480 --> 01:34:43.360
But I have the opportunity
to ask one question.

01:34:43.360 --> 01:34:44.960
I wanted to ask Anna.

01:34:44.960 --> 01:34:49.740
So I will confess to be being
something of a language maven.

01:34:49.740 --> 01:34:51.510
I'm not an expert
in linguistics,

01:34:51.510 --> 01:34:54.720
but I'm always interested
in languages and how they

01:34:54.720 --> 01:34:57.030
evolve and change in humans.

01:34:57.030 --> 01:35:01.450
And what struck me was, when
you were talking about the whale

01:35:01.450 --> 01:35:04.430
populations, I
was just wondering

01:35:04.430 --> 01:35:08.570
in the back of my mind,
do they learn their songs?

01:35:08.570 --> 01:35:12.660
And is there an evolution
over time and location

01:35:12.660 --> 01:35:15.985
the same way you would see
different language populations

01:35:15.985 --> 01:35:17.410
in humans on Earth?

01:35:17.410 --> 01:35:20.130
Does that sound right?

01:35:20.130 --> 01:35:23.990
-Yes, so there are several
examples now that we've seen.

01:35:23.990 --> 01:35:28.430
In humpback whales, songs change
over time and they evolve.

01:35:28.430 --> 01:35:30.870
And we have seen now
that in some there

01:35:30.870 --> 01:35:33.450
is an example off
of Australia where

01:35:33.450 --> 01:35:40.190
there was a new animal that came
to the East Coast of Australia,

01:35:40.190 --> 01:35:42.240
singing the Western
Australia song.

01:35:42.240 --> 01:35:43.920
And within two
seasons, everybody

01:35:43.920 --> 01:35:46.990
adopted the new songs.

01:35:46.990 --> 01:35:49.990
Clearly it was better.

01:35:49.990 --> 01:35:51.940
But then there's
also this gradual--

01:35:51.940 --> 01:35:55.800
-The hip, new whales
the cool new whale.

01:35:55.800 --> 01:35:57.780
-Exactly, and also
humpback song is really

01:35:57.780 --> 01:36:00.460
the one that's been most
looked at in studies.

01:36:00.460 --> 01:36:03.430
We know there a kind of a
cultural transmission of song

01:36:03.430 --> 01:36:06.800
across the Pacific from
the West to the East,

01:36:06.800 --> 01:36:09.804
where it's been progressively
changing and moving its way.

01:36:09.804 --> 01:36:11.220
But recently,
actually some of the

01:36:11.220 --> 01:36:13.280
work that I'm doing
with colleagues,

01:36:13.280 --> 01:36:17.900
we're finding that fin
whales, which they actually

01:36:17.900 --> 01:36:24.330
have very similar pattern of
the sound that they produce.

01:36:24.330 --> 01:36:26.950
It's just this very
short, down sweep,

01:36:26.950 --> 01:36:30.050
but the pattern in
which they produce them,

01:36:30.050 --> 01:36:32.340
they're very, very
regularly repeated.

01:36:32.340 --> 01:36:34.040
It's almost like a metronome.

01:36:34.040 --> 01:36:37.540
And what we have found
is that in some places,

01:36:37.540 --> 01:36:41.430
they'll have these songs change
or the pattern of the intervals

01:36:41.430 --> 01:36:48.270
changes across the year, where
it starts relatively fast,

01:36:48.270 --> 01:36:51.040
and then gradually gets slower
and slower across the mating

01:36:51.040 --> 01:36:51.840
season.

01:36:51.840 --> 01:36:55.220
And so, all the fin whales
across the North Pacific

01:36:55.220 --> 01:36:56.980
do the same thing,
the same pattern.

01:36:56.980 --> 01:37:00.080
They start at the same rate
and then they all together

01:37:00.080 --> 01:37:01.394
get slower and slower.

01:37:01.394 --> 01:37:03.310
And then in Southern
California just recently,

01:37:03.310 --> 01:37:06.629
we've seen that they've
actually changed their song.

01:37:06.629 --> 01:37:08.420
And now it's a completely
different pattern

01:37:08.420 --> 01:37:09.878
that just slowly,
gradually there's

01:37:09.878 --> 01:37:12.150
no longer the seasonal
cycle, but over time it's

01:37:12.150 --> 01:37:13.620
getting slower and slower.

01:37:13.620 --> 01:37:19.260
So there clearly is some
transmission and exchange

01:37:19.260 --> 01:37:22.930
between these
different populations,

01:37:22.930 --> 01:37:26.418
but we don't really know a
whole lot about how that works.

01:37:26.418 --> 01:37:27.290
-Fascinating.

01:37:27.290 --> 01:37:29.800
OK, so let's thank
our speakers again.

01:37:29.800 --> 01:37:32.850
[APPLAUSE]
