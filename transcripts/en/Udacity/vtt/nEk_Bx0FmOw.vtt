00:00:00.025 --> 00:00:03.840
Okay. Now that I've added onion powder to the recipe, oh,

00:00:03.840 --> 00:00:05.350
I have a message from Sarah.

00:00:05.350 --> 00:00:08.020
I guess she made a change removing cumin from the chili recipe.

00:00:08.020 --> 00:00:11.050
Yeah, I agree, I don't like cumin much.

00:00:11.050 --> 00:00:12.000
Sounds good.

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:13.840
Now, I'll go take a look at that.

00:00:13.840 --> 00:00:16.410
I'll look at the commit history to see Sarah's change.

00:00:16.410 --> 00:00:17.210
Looks like this one.

00:00:18.210 --> 00:00:20.420
Now I'll scroll down to see the dif.

00:00:20.420 --> 00:00:22.120
And it looks pretty straightforward.

00:00:22.120 --> 00:00:24.960
She removed cumin from the ingredients list and

00:00:24.960 --> 00:00:27.640
she removed the direction to add cumin.

00:00:27.640 --> 00:00:28.380
Since Sarah and

00:00:28.380 --> 00:00:33.310
I both modified the same line though, Git is going to mark this as a conflict.

00:00:33.310 --> 00:00:33.980
On the next screen,

00:00:33.980 --> 00:00:37.520
you'll see some instructions to add Sarah's changes to your own fork.

00:00:37.520 --> 00:00:40.010
Then Sarah will go over how I can resolve this conflict.
