00:00:00.380 --> 00:00:03.770
So gametes produced from germ cells through

00:00:03.770 --> 00:00:07.140
the process of meiosis end up with only

00:00:07.140 --> 00:00:10.090
23 chromosomes, whereas the germ cells, their parent

00:00:10.090 --> 00:00:13.740
cells, had 46 chromosomes. This is essential to

00:00:13.740 --> 00:00:16.010
make sure that at fertilization, the sperm

00:00:16.010 --> 00:00:18.780
and the egg combine 23 chromosomes a piece

00:00:18.780 --> 00:00:22.480
to get 46 total, the complete genome necessary

00:00:22.480 --> 00:00:26.150
to make a human. Now, this particular process

00:00:26.150 --> 00:00:29.180
of DNA duplication with two rounds of cell division is

00:00:29.180 --> 00:00:33.210
unique to meiosis, and only germ cells do it. All

00:00:33.210 --> 00:00:35.750
other cells in your body divide through a process of

00:00:35.750 --> 00:00:39.470
mitosis, where there's one DNA duplication event and only one

00:00:39.470 --> 00:00:42.270
cell division. Now, take a look at the gametes here,

00:00:42.270 --> 00:00:45.580
the sex cells produced as a product of meiosis. There

00:00:45.580 --> 00:00:48.300
are no chromosome pairs anymore, every chromosome pair is split

00:00:48.300 --> 00:00:52.030
up. And alleles ended up going to their own gamete.

00:00:52.030 --> 00:00:55.630
This is called the law of segregation. This law

00:00:55.630 --> 00:00:59.340
simply means that allele pairs separate during gamete formation.

00:00:59.340 --> 00:01:01.170
This is something that's been known for a very

00:01:01.170 --> 00:01:03.850
long time. In fact, Gregor Mendel, who you saw

00:01:03.850 --> 00:01:06.880
in lesson one, was the first person to ever

00:01:06.880 --> 00:01:11.000
identify this particular phenomenon. So based on what you

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:12.730
see here and what you now know about the

00:01:12.730 --> 00:01:17.130
law of segregation, what is the probability that the dominant

00:01:17.130 --> 00:01:20.130
lactase persistence allele, the plus symbol here, will

00:01:20.130 --> 00:01:23.050
get past on, carried onto the next generation?
