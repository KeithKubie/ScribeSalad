a game would not be an option so I

00:01:38.780 --> 00:01:38.790
a game would not be an option so I
 

00:01:38.790 --> 00:01:40.490
a game would not be an option so I
experimented with a design that would

standards Robert said the Chile would
 

00:02:15.250 --> 00:02:17.039
standards Robert said the Chile would
have to remain above a hundred and

00:02:17.039 --> 00:02:17.049
have to remain above a hundred and
 

00:02:17.049 --> 00:02:19.140
have to remain above a hundred and
thirty five degrees Fahrenheit at all

thirty five degrees Fahrenheit at all
 

00:02:19.150 --> 00:02:22.080
thirty five degrees Fahrenheit at all
times but when I put it on the heat was

00:02:22.080 --> 00:02:22.090
times but when I put it on the heat was
 

00:02:22.090 --> 00:02:24.149
times but when I put it on the heat was
so intense that I could barely have it

00:02:24.149 --> 00:02:24.159
so intense that I could barely have it
 

00:02:24.159 --> 00:02:25.830

so I tracked down some heat resistant

00:02:29.039 --> 00:02:29.049
so I tracked down some heat resistant
 

00:02:29.049 --> 00:02:31.320

against the most extreme temperatures I
did a preliminary test with a blowtorch

00:02:37.890 --> 00:02:37.900
did a preliminary test with a blowtorch
 

00:02:37.900 --> 00:02:40.080
did a preliminary test with a blowtorch
on various parts of my body to ensure

on various parts of my body to ensure
 

00:02:40.090 --> 00:02:42.119
on various parts of my body to ensure
the gel would protect even my most

00:02:42.119 --> 00:02:42.129
the gel would protect even my most
 

00:02:42.129 --> 00:02:46.559
the gel would protect even my most
sensitive regions and after getting

00:02:46.559 --> 00:02:46.569
sensitive regions and after getting
 

00:02:46.569 --> 00:02:49.080
sensitive regions and after getting
gelled up from head to toe the burning

00:02:49.080 --> 00:02:49.090

it seemed like we had solved every
 

00:02:54.069 --> 00:02:56.520
it seemed like we had solved every
problem but there was still one final

00:02:56.520 --> 00:02:56.530
problem but there was still one final
 

00:02:56.530 --> 00:02:59.430
problem but there was still one final
thing I had to take care of the pump on

00:02:59.430 --> 00:02:59.440
thing I had to take care of the pump on
 

00:02:59.440 --> 00:03:00.900

detector so I figured if I could

00:03:09.539 --> 00:03:09.549
detector so I figured if I could
 

00:03:09.549 --> 00:03:11.729
detector so I figured if I could
convince security that I had a medically

00:03:11.729 --> 00:03:11.739
convince security that I had a medically
 

00:03:11.739 --> 00:03:13.830

necessary pacemaker they wouldn't be

00:03:13.830 --> 00:03:13.840
necessary pacemaker they wouldn't be
 

00:03:13.840 --> 00:03:16.080

00:03:16.080 --> 00:03:16.090
suspicious when the alarm went off
 

00:03:16.090 --> 00:03:18.629
suspicious when the alarm went off
so I taped a real pacemaker to my chest

00:03:18.629 --> 00:03:18.639
so I taped a real pacemaker to my chest
 

00:03:18.639 --> 00:03:20.970
so I taped a real pacemaker to my chest
and then headed to a walk-in clinic to

00:03:20.970 --> 00:03:20.980
and then headed to a walk-in clinic to
 

00:03:20.980 --> 00:03:22.770
and then headed to a walk-in clinic to
request an x-ray that would hopefully

00:03:22.770 --> 00:03:22.780
request an x-ray that would hopefully
 

00:03:22.780 --> 00:03:24.870

need the x-ray I have to have a reason
 

00:03:32.859 --> 00:03:36.960
need the x-ray I have to have a reason
why well I'm paying you for it so what

00:03:36.960 --> 00:03:36.970
why well I'm paying you for it so what
 

00:03:36.970 --> 00:03:41.610

do you care I'm actually legally it's
 

00:03:41.620 --> 00:03:46.050
do you care I'm actually legally it's
it's being monitored do you see why

00:03:46.050 --> 00:03:46.060
it's being monitored do you see why
 

00:03:46.060 --> 00:03:49.020
