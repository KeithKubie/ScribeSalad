00:00:00.630 --> 00:00:01.630
[BACKGROUND VOICES]

00:00:01.630 --> 00:00:04.330
Bruce Sewell &gt;&gt; Hi, Pablo. Hi, YouTube viewers.
AH-my name's Bruce Sewell. I'm with Intel.

00:00:04.330 --> 00:00:09.580
Um-I'm the Chief Legal Counsel and I'm also
responsible for corporate social responsibility.

00:00:09.580 --> 00:00:14.860
I think it's a great question. Um-the difference,
I think, though, between CEOs and doctors

00:00:14.860 --> 00:00:19.210
and lawyers is that doctors and lawyers are
regulated by the state. They have to pass

00:00:19.210 --> 00:00:24.069
a licensing exam in order to be qualified
to practice. And as a result the state has

00:00:24.069 --> 00:00:28.569
sort of a heightened interest in making sure
that they have certain levels of competence

00:00:28.569 --> 00:00:32.630
and that they follow certain standards of
behaviors. I'd be a bit uncomfortable about

00:00:32.630 --> 00:00:38.530
trying to superimpose some sort of regulatory
structure on CEOs in general. I think because

00:00:38.530 --> 00:00:45.040
it's likely to have sort of an in-inhibiting
effect on the entrepreneurship that we want

00:00:45.040 --> 00:00:49.930
to encourage among the CEOs.
But having said that, certainly CEOs are no

00:00:49.930 --> 00:00:57.190
less in need of a code of responsibility or
of a code of ethics than are lawyers or doctors.

00:00:57.190 --> 00:01:03.680
So, what I'd like to see is some sort of cross-functional-perhaps
a comprehensive-attempt to define a code of

00:01:03.680 --> 00:01:09.270
conduct and then make the adoption of that
code and the adherence to that code a matter

00:01:09.270 --> 00:01:15.719
of voluntary participation. But it should
be transparent. So a CEO who signs up to this

00:01:15.719 --> 00:01:20.100
that fact should be known to the shareholders
and to the Board of Directors. A CEO who chooses

00:01:20.100 --> 00:01:25.970
not to sign up to this, that fact should also
be known and could be taken into account when

00:01:25.970 --> 00:01:30.540
the shareholders or when the directors are
considering that CEO's performance and considering

00:01:30.540 --> 00:01:34.919
that CEO for, perhaps, continuation of employment.
So that's what I'd like to say.
