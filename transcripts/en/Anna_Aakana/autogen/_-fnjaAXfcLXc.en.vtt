00:00:01.460 --> 00:00:02.340
There she is.

00:00:02.760 --> 00:00:03.960
That's the thief.

00:00:03.960 --> 00:00:05.500
That's the woman who stole your heart, sir?

00:00:06.340 --> 00:00:07.620
She stole my heart.

00:00:08.320 --> 00:00:09.120
Wait, what?

00:00:09.340 --> 00:00:10.380
How could you!?

00:00:10.900 --> 00:00:12.980
You said I was the only one!

00:00:13.360 --> 00:00:16.000
I told him I didn't want a relationship.

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:17.800
Ain't my fault dicks don't quit.

00:00:18.700 --> 00:00:19.500
Arrest her!

00:00:19.640 --> 00:00:20.920
She stole my heart.

00:00:20.920 --> 00:00:23.920
Okay, well that's technically not even a crime.

00:00:23.920 --> 00:00:26.220
If you gave her your heart that's actually a gift.

00:00:26.220 --> 00:00:27.760
It might be tax-deductible, you could check into that

00:00:27.760 --> 00:00:29.460
with your accountant if you have one--

00:00:29.480 --> 00:00:30.200
*sobbing*

00:00:30.540 --> 00:00:31.800
You know once you give her your heart--

00:00:31.800 --> 00:00:34.380
*sobs louder*

00:00:35.600 --> 00:00:37.600
Which one is the aronist, sir?

00:00:38.620 --> 00:00:42.700
Number 2.  She's the one who set my passion aflame.

00:00:42.700 --> 00:00:44.040
Wait, why are you even upset about that?

00:00:44.040 --> 00:00:45.900
That sounds amazing.

00:00:45.900 --> 00:00:48.200
I haven't connected with a woman in so long

00:00:48.200 --> 00:00:49.920
it's like every time we get close it just goes like

00:00:49.920 --> 00:00:53.100
Eh.  There's like Tinder and J-Swipe--all this stuff out there.

00:00:53.100 --> 00:00:54.880
How do you ever know that someone is the one?

00:00:54.880 --> 00:00:56.440
There's so many options nowadays.

00:00:59.920 --> 00:01:00.960
That's the one.

00:01:01.700 --> 00:01:02.920
That's the murderer.

00:01:02.920 --> 00:01:05.940
Oh let me guess, she murdered your chance at love.

00:01:05.940 --> 00:01:07.800
Or she killed your hopes and dreams.

00:01:07.800 --> 00:01:10.580
Or she put an end to the idea of a happy life together.

00:01:11.960 --> 00:01:15.180
No man, she murdered my wife in front of me.

00:01:16.520 --> 00:01:17.020
Oh.

00:01:17.320 --> 00:01:19.560
And then she yelled out "Yahtzee"

00:01:21.440 --> 00:01:22.720
Thank you, Big Red.

00:01:22.940 --> 00:01:24.860
What the fuck is wrong with you?

00:01:24.860 --> 00:01:27.500
Man, that is a good question.  I honestly don't know.

00:01:27.500 --> 00:01:29.560
I mean, I was an only child so I feel like it starts there.

00:01:29.820 --> 00:01:31.400
Ate too much sugar cereal.

00:01:31.400 --> 00:01:33.040
Which I think is like a big thing for a kid

00:01:33.040 --> 00:01:33.860
--it's like a bad thing.

00:01:33.860 --> 00:01:36.000
I used to finger barbies.  Something is wrong with me.

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:37.700
I don't have time to go to therapy, I'm really busy.

00:01:37.700 --> 00:01:39.460
I was telling the other guy that--but something is wrong.

00:01:39.460 --> 00:01:40.360
Something is really wrong.

00:01:40.360 --> 00:01:41.000
Yahtzee!

00:01:41.020 --> 00:01:42.460
