Lee Bollinger: Thank you very much, Mr.

00:00:28.250 --> 00:00:29.660
President. I would also like to

00:00:29.660 --> 00:00:34.910
recognize some special guests that we
have. First lady Hero Ahmed is here.

00:00:34.910 --> 00:00:41.910
Please recognize her. I believe your son

00:00:46.180 --> 00:00:50.170
has also joined us here, and his name

00:00:50.170 --> 00:00:57.170
is Qubad Talabany. We have the Minister
of State for Women's Affairs, Ms. al-

00:01:05.059 --> 00:01:12.059
Shakly, the Minister of Labor, Mr. *Sali,

00:01:15.490 --> 00:01:22.490
and the Minister of Technology, Ms.

00:01:26.670 --> 00:01:33.670
Putros. We would now like to open the
floor for questions. Please go. I'd like to

00:01:34.780 --> 00:01:36.780
give priority to Columbia students.\

00:01:36.780 --> 00:01:41.659
Casey Barnett: Good morning. My name is

00:01:41.659 --> 00:01:44.490
Casey Barnett. I am a student with

00:01:44.490 --> 00:01:49.579
the business school here at Columbia.
I'm also the director of Cam-Ed, a

00:01:49.579 --> 00:01:51.999
research and training Institute in Southeast

00:01:51.999 --> 00:01:55.319
Asia. Your Excellency, you

00:01:55.319 --> 00:02:02.319
mentioned that the Iraqi Constitution
is the best in the region. Yet, Article7 of

00:02:03.439 --> 00:02:04.310
the

00:02:04.310 --> 00:02:10.080
Constitution forbids Ba'ath Party members
from becoming part of the political

00:02:10.080 --> 00:02:13.300
system. Now, most people became Ba'ath

00:02:13.300 --> 00:02:16.740
party members to go to college or get

00:02:16.740 --> 00:02:22.910
a job. Wouldn't it be smarter for your
government to focus on the leaders of the

00:02:22.910 --> 00:02:25.290
Ba'ath Party, rather than the rank and

00:02:25.290 --> 00:02:25.540
file?

00:02:25.459 --> 00:02:32.459
Lee Bollinger: We also should, take this

00:02:41.360 --> 00:02:44.910
occasion, you can just lineup behind

00:02:44.910 --> 00:02:48.440
the microphones to ask questions.

00:02:48.440 --> 00:02:52.940
President Jalal Talabani: This is not

00:02:52.940 --> 00:02:57.430
true. Not all Ba'athists are prevented from

00:02:57.430 --> 00:03:03.420
participating. Only the criminals and
special rank of Ba'athists are prevented.

00:03:03.420 --> 00:03:08.250
But the big majority of them are permitted.

00:03:08.250 --> 00:03:11.460
They are considered as Iraqis. They

00:03:11.460 --> 00:03:17.910
can participate in the democratic process.
And even many of them are still in

00:03:17.910 --> 00:03:21.380
jobs, in universities, in schools, in

00:03:21.380 --> 00:03:26.130
departments, in administration, and only who

00:03:26.130 --> 00:03:31.120
are prevented from that, those who committed
crimes according to law.

00:03:31.120 --> 00:03:33.540
Lee Bollinger: Next question.

00:03:33.540 --> 00:03:36.610
Garth Stewart: Sir, my name is Garth Stewart,

00:03:36.610 --> 00:03:38.410
and I'm a general studies

00:03:38.410 --> 00:03:44.040
student here at Columbia. And, I was in
the Third Infantry Division in 2003 and I

00:03:44.040 --> 00:03:47.730
was a very active participant in the liberation

00:03:47.730 --> 00:03:47.980
of Iraq. And I have to say--

00:03:47.740 --> 00:03:47.990
Lee Bollinger: I'm sorry. Let me just

00:03:47.780 --> 00:03:49.800
ask, put the microphone up so that you

00:03:49.800 --> 00:03:52.230
can be heard more clearly.

00:03:52.230 --> 00:03:59.230
Garth Stewart: Is this all right? Is this

00:04:00.480 --> 00:04:00.940
acceptable if I just bend my head a little

00:04:00.940 --> 00:04:01.190
bit?

00:04:01.010 --> 00:04:01.350
Lee Bollinger: That's good. That's good.

00:04:01.350 --> 00:04:06.070
Garth Stewart: I was in the Third Infantry

00:04:06.070 --> 00:04:07.820
Division, an active participant in the

00:04:07.820 --> 00:04:10.650
liberation of Iraq. And I have to say,
it's an honor to hear you speak here today,

00:04:10.650 --> 00:04:13.790
sir. My question is, in your speech, you

00:04:13.790 --> 00:04:16.859
referred to a new Iraq. And I wanted to

00:04:16.859 --> 00:04:23.859
know, do you ever plan on seeking some
sort of reform in the Middle East as it

00:04:25.220 --> 00:04:26.960
concerns other governments that aren't

00:04:26.960 --> 00:04:29.479
so enlightened as what Iraq is

00:04:29.479 --> 00:04:30.880
becoming?

00:04:30.880 --> 00:04:37.880
President Jalal Talabani: Of course. For

00:04:38.759 --> 00:04:41.610
this reason, many of our neighbors

00:04:41.610 --> 00:04:48.370
are very, are not happy and satisfied
because a democratic, federal, stable Iraq

00:04:48.370 --> 00:04:50.860
will inspire all people of Middle East

00:04:50.860 --> 00:04:54.980
to free themselves from dictatorship and to

00:04:54.980 --> 00:05:01.980
enjoy democracy. For that, I think you;
when you're in Iraq, observe that many

00:05:02.020 --> 00:05:06.420
neighbors are not satisfied with the liberation

00:05:06.420 --> 00:05:08.050
of Iraq or having democracy and

00:05:08.050 --> 00:05:09.440
democratic rights in Iraq.

00:05:09.440 --> 00:05:16.440
Manal Alam: Hi. Mr. President, my name

00:05:21.750 --> 00:05:28.750
is Manal Alam, and I'm a student in

00:05:34.070 --> 00:05:41.070
the engineering school. What will it take
in the future for Iraq to have a separate

00:05:42.669 --> 00:05:43.570
political identity not linked to the United

00:05:43.570 --> 00:05:43.820
States?

00:05:43.780 --> 00:05:45.840
President Jalal Talabani: I think we are

00:05:45.840 --> 00:05:46.910
an independent country, and Iraqi

00:05:46.910 --> 00:05:47.970
people are proud to be independent and
we always struggle to be an

00:05:47.970 --> 00:05:50.340
independent country, but we are in need

00:05:50.340 --> 00:05:54.220
to a kind of core operation and alliances

00:05:54.220 --> 00:06:01.220
in this global of we are so far living
in it, and this globalization is demanding

00:06:02.919 --> 00:06:03.680
that

00:06:03.680 --> 00:06:07.540
countries must look kind of cooperation
and coordination among them.

00:06:07.540 --> 00:06:09.730
Lee Bollinger: Next question.

00:06:09.730 --> 00:06:12.310
Cham Laden: Mr. President, my name is

00:06:12.310 --> 00:06:14.889
Cham Laden, I'm a journalism

00:06:14.889 --> 00:06:20.700
student here. And as I understand it,
you have the very admirable policy of not

00:06:20.700 --> 00:06:23.650
signing execution warrants which Iraq

00:06:23.650 --> 00:06:26.860
courts pass up to your office and delegate

00:06:26.860 --> 00:06:32.800
this duty to a deputy. And I also understand
that this is because the Democratic

00:06:32.800 --> 00:06:36.150
patriotic alliance of Kurdistan is obliged

00:06:36.150 --> 00:06:39.100
under treaties you signed not to endorse

00:06:39.100 --> 00:06:45.010
the death penalty. I think that's wholly
admirable, but I was wondering if you

00:06:45.010 --> 00:06:48.310
thought it was a problem, or set a poor

00:06:48.310 --> 00:06:51.500
precedent for the president of a sovereign

00:06:51.500 --> 00:06:58.500
country of Iraq to be bound by regional
obligations, not to fulfill sections of his

00:06:59.139 --> 00:07:00.190
office. Thank you.

00:07:00.190 --> 00:07:04.960
President Jalal Talabani: Well, you know,

00:07:04.960 --> 00:07:07.430
we are in Iraq now enjoying

00:07:07.430 --> 00:07:12.220
democracy. We have different parties and
groups from Left, extreme Left to

00:07:12.220 --> 00:07:14.919
extreme Right. Of course, different attitudes.

00:07:14.919 --> 00:07:19.090
I am, as a lawyer, I signed an

00:07:19.090 --> 00:07:24.720
international appeal against the death
penalty. And I'm respecting my signature.

00:07:24.720 --> 00:07:31.720
For that, I am able, (applause) even I

00:07:33.080 --> 00:07:37.580
said, if I was one day obliged to choose

00:07:37.580 --> 00:07:43.270
 between my principles and the post, I
will leave the post and keep my, protect my

00:07:43.270 --> 00:07:50.270
principles. (applause) I know that perhaps

00:07:51.120 --> 00:07:53.930
the next president will not be in the

00:07:53.930 --> 00:08:00.930
same way and the same kind of thinking.
But it's my belief, and I cannot deny

00:08:01.050 --> 00:08:03.090
my signature.

00:08:03.090 --> 00:08:04.949
Lee Bollinger: Next question.

00:08:04.949 --> 00:08:07.360
Patrick Luhem: Hello, Mr. President, my

00:08:07.360 --> 00:08:10.870
name is Patrick Luhem. I'm a student

00:08:10.870 --> 00:08:14.870
of Japanese literature here in the Graduate
School of Arts and Sciences and I

00:08:14.870 --> 00:08:17.020
wanted to thank you for your speech and

00:08:17.020 --> 00:08:18.110
also welcome you to Columbia. During

00:08:18.110 --> 00:08:20.110
your speech, you spoke about the kindness
and generosity of American troops.

00:08:20.110 --> 00:08:27.110
And, with
that attitude, I was wondering how you interpret

00:08:29.380 --> 00:08:29.979
an event like what

00:08:29.979 --> 00:08:30.479
happened at Abu Ghraib.

00:08:30.479 --> 00:08:31.280
President Jalal Talabani: Yeah, that was,

00:08:31.280 --> 00:08:31.540
in Abu Ghraib something was very

00:08:31.540 --> 00:08:36.449
bad happened, that some American soldiers,
simple soldiers violated the human

00:08:36.449 --> 00:08:38.769
rights. But I'd like to remind you, Abu

00:08:38.769 --> 00:08:41.380
Ghraib was a prison in Iraq when

00:08:41.380 --> 00:08:47.430
thousands and thousands of Iraqis were
executed. It was a prisoner of tens of

00:08:47.430 --> 00:08:50.459
thousands of Iraqis visited this prison,

00:08:50.459 --> 00:08:53.870
and suffered worse kind of torture and

00:08:53.870 --> 00:08:58.320
violating of human rights. For that, of
course, we condemn what happened

00:08:58.320 --> 00:09:02.640
against Iraqis, because we want to have

00:09:02.640 --> 00:09:05.100
the human rights everywhere in Iraq,

00:09:05.100 --> 00:09:11.050
and human rights must be respected by
Americans, Iraqis, everyone. But, when

00:09:11.050 --> 00:09:14.610
Iraqis remember prison of Abu Ghraib,

00:09:14.610 --> 00:09:16.270
they are remembering thousands and

00:09:16.270 --> 00:09:18.540
thousands of the martyrs who were killed
in that prison.

00:09:18.540 --> 00:09:20.660
Lee Bollinger: Next question.

00:09:20.660 --> 00:09:23.380
Marin Dunnaheim: Mr. President, my name

00:09:23.380 --> 00:09:25.500
is Marin Dunnaheim. I'm Masters

00:09:25.500 --> 00:09:29.430
of Laws student from Ireland. In light
of the Constitutionalization and the

00:09:29.430 --> 00:09:32.460
problems that have sewn in Iraq, what

00:09:32.460 --> 00:09:34.880
is the possibility of the complete

00:09:34.880 --> 00:09:39.420
secularization of Iraq in light of the
role that religious law plays and religious

00:09:39.420 --> 00:09:41.540
diversity plays in Iraq?

00:09:41.540 --> 00:09:44.190
President Jalal Talabani: Well, we couldn't

00:09:44.190 --> 00:09:47.080
reach a secular state, hundreds

00:09:47.080 --> 00:09:50.160
person (inaudible). There was a kind of
compromise, as I told you in my speech.

00:09:50.160 --> 00:09:53.950
There is of course we have strong Islamic

00:09:53.950 --> 00:09:56.510
parties. There were, even some of

00:09:56.510 --> 00:10:00.330
them were asking for an Islamic Republic.
For example, we couldn't reach

00:10:00.330 --> 00:10:02.320
agreement with a group of Sunni Arabs

00:10:02.320 --> 00:10:05.440
about the article, which says that Islam is

00:10:05.440 --> 00:10:12.080
a source for laws. They insisted that
it must be the main source of all laws. We

00:10:12.080 --> 00:10:16.790
refused it. We tried to reach a kind of

00:10:16.790 --> 00:10:20.779
compromise that we could in the same

00:10:20.779 --> 00:10:26.440
time, respect the democratic principles
and respect Islam as the religious of the

00:10:26.440 --> 00:10:29.529
majority of Iraq. Of course it's respecting

00:10:29.529 --> 00:10:33.330
other religions, like Christianity, like

00:10:33.330 --> 00:10:35.620
Azadis, like Sabbis and others which
mentioned in this Constitution.

00:10:35.620 --> 00:10:35.870
Lee Bollinger: Next question.

00:10:35.630 --> 00:10:35.880
Shirley Shavit: Hello, Mr. President.

00:10:35.649 --> 00:10:36.800
My name is Shirley Shavit. I'm the

00:10:36.800 --> 00:10:42.800
director of an international department,
and biggest women's organization in

00:10:42.800 --> 00:10:49.010
Israel. First of all, it was a great honor

00:10:49.010 --> 00:10:55.240
to hear you and to listen to what you said.

00:10:55.240 --> 00:11:00.149
And I'm very concerned and would like
to ask your attitude regarding the state of

00:11:00.149 --> 00:11:03.149
Israel, regarding the future coexistence

00:11:03.149 --> 00:11:06.910
with Iraq. And I think we have a lot in

00:11:06.910 --> 00:11:08.480
common regarding our concern for world
democracy as well as the Al Qaeda

00:11:08.480 --> 00:11:12.270
threat to the whole world. 

00:11:12.270 --> 00:11:12.740
Thank you very much.

00:11:12.740 --> 00:11:16.010
President Jalal Talabani: Well, thank

00:11:16.010 --> 00:11:18.220
you for question. And we are in Iraq

00:11:18.220 --> 00:11:22.649
committed to our member and active member
and founder member of the

00:11:22.649 --> 00:11:25.490
league, Arab League. We are part of the

00:11:25.490 --> 00:11:29.339
Arab world. Iraq participated on all the

00:11:29.339 --> 00:11:35.770
summit, Arab summits. The last one, which
was in Beirut, decided that a

00:11:35.770 --> 00:11:40.760
doctorate, proposal, presented by then

00:11:40.760 --> 00:11:44.839
president, now King Abdullah of Saudi

00:11:44.839 --> 00:11:51.839
Arabia, according to this proposal, there
is some kind of promise if Israel will

00:11:53.770 --> 00:11:56.060
respect all resolutions passed by the

00:11:56.060 --> 00:11:59.980
United Nations and recognize the existence

00:11:59.980 --> 00:12:06.339
of a peaceful Palestinian state. The Arab
countries will normalize relation with

00:12:06.339 --> 00:12:11.230
Israel, and will have full kind of contracts

00:12:11.230 --> 00:12:14.070
with them. It's now up to Israeli people

00:12:14.070 --> 00:12:21.010
and Israeli government to decide to accept
this proposal of King Abdullah, and

00:12:21.010 --> 00:12:23.519
then I think everything will be normal

00:12:23.519 --> 00:12:23.769
and open.

00:12:23.740 --> 00:12:25.089
Lee Bollinger: Yes.

00:12:25.089 --> 00:12:26.880
Carmack MacGee: I'm Carmack MacGee.

00:12:26.880 --> 00:12:29.330
I'm his master student at the

00:12:29.330 --> 00:12:31.140
school of International and Public Affairs.
(speaks Arabic) Columbia.

00:12:31.140 --> 00:12:31.390
President Jalal Talabani: (speaks Arabic).

00:12:31.230 --> 00:12:31.480
Carmack MacGee: Being Middle Eastern,

00:12:31.320 --> 00:12:31.570
specifically from Lebanon, I just want

00:12:31.410 --> 00:12:38.410
to let everyone know that any change in
the Middle East is better than the status

00:12:41.600 --> 00:12:45.990
quo. So some people who argue--at this

00:12:45.990 --> 00:12:48.420
point in time--so some people who

00:12:48.420 --> 00:12:54.230
argue about whether the U.S. should have
gone in or out, I think the change was

00:12:54.230 --> 00:12:57.500
very important. However, I do have a concern.

00:12:57.500 --> 00:12:58.779
In your speech, you said a

00:12:58.779 --> 00:13:05.779
repeated number of times that you are
killing and capturing the terrorists. I was

00:13:08.050 --> 00:13:10.380
just wondering, these people strive and

00:13:10.380 --> 00:13:14.220
breed on the blood of their martyr

00:13:14.220 --> 00:13:19.690
brothers. Do you think that by killing
and capturing these terrorists, you will be

00:13:19.690 --> 00:13:25.709
solving the problem of insurgencies? Because

00:13:25.709 --> 00:13:28.500
I find that this is only addressing

00:13:28.500 --> 00:13:31.140
the symptom of terrorism rather than the
radical cause of terrorism. So what

00:13:31.140 --> 00:13:33.220
measures are being done by the Iraqi government

00:13:33.220 --> 00:13:34.550
to address social welfare and education?

00:13:34.920 --> 00:13:36.560
President Jalal Talabani: Yes. Well, killing

00:13:36.560 --> 00:13:39.580
is not enough. But don't forget, we

00:13:39.580 --> 00:13:42.830
are killing those terrorists in defense
of ourselves. They are attacking us, and we

00:13:42.830 --> 00:13:46.910
are killing them. This is a very important

00:13:46.910 --> 00:13:48.170
point you must take it in consideration.

00:13:48.170 --> 00:13:51.940
When they are coming for example to occupy
a town, we are not ready to

00:13:51.940 --> 00:13:54.180
surrender to them, we are going to resist,

00:13:54.180 --> 00:13:57.110
to liberate the town, and we are killing

00:13:57.110 --> 00:14:03.399
those who are trying to impose their rule
by force on the people. This is one.

00:14:03.399 --> 00:14:06.519
Second, we believe that there must be

00:14:06.519 --> 00:14:10.930
a comprehensive plan for facing terrorism.

00:14:10.930 --> 00:14:17.120
This plan must be political, economic,
media, public opinion, relation with

00:14:17.120 --> 00:14:22.940
diplomacy, many things here. And I think

00:14:22.940 --> 00:14:27.510
those who came, terrorists in Iraq are

00:14:27.510 --> 00:14:30.079
different groups. Some different, some
groups are from Al Qaeda, and

00:14:30.079 --> 00:14:32.120
fundamentalist Islamists who came and

00:14:32.120 --> 00:14:37.140
declared the order of annihilation. They

00:14:37.140 --> 00:14:39.190
openly say it.

00:14:39.190 --> 00:14:42.200
And statesmen, that are killing all shades,

00:14:42.200 --> 00:14:44.459
and consider all shades out of Islam.

00:14:44.459 --> 00:14:46.910
And also, they're killing all Kurdists.
Because they are allies of the United States

00:14:46.910 --> 00:14:52.660
of America. Well, a group coming to declare

00:14:52.660 --> 00:14:56.029
the war of annihilation, what do you

00:14:56.029 --> 00:15:02.940
want for us? Maybe we got to (inaudible).
This is one. Second, second, as you

00:15:02.940 --> 00:15:04.930
said, any change in Middle East is very,

00:15:04.930 --> 00:15:07.470
very important. And especially,

00:15:07.470 --> 00:15:11.950
democratic change is very important. It
will change the Middle East. And those

00:15:11.950 --> 00:15:14.980
who are afraid from new Iraq, they are

00:15:14.980 --> 00:15:17.260
afraid from democracy and from

00:15:17.260 --> 00:15:19.350
democratization in Middle East.

00:15:19.350 --> 00:15:22.570
Andrew Monaghan: Mr. President, it's an

00:15:22.570 --> 00:15:24.260
honor to have you here today. My

00:15:24.260 --> 00:15:28.230
name is Andrew Monaghan and I'm with the
School of International and Public

00:15:28.230 --> 00:15:32.050
Affairs. We learn from the American experience

00:15:32.050 --> 00:15:33.860
as the oldest democracy in the

00:15:33.860 --> 00:15:40.670
world that one of the true potential threats
of the federalist system is Civil War.

00:15:40.670 --> 00:15:43.260
What assurances do you give the world

00:15:43.260 --> 00:15:46.399
that Iraq can become a true federalist

00:15:46.399 --> 00:15:48.760
democracy that will stay together? Thank
you.

00:15:48.760 --> 00:15:51.470
President Jalal Talabani: Well, it depends

00:15:51.470 --> 00:15:54.769
on the will of Iraqi people. It's also

00:15:54.769 --> 00:16:00.290
mentioned in the Constitution that Iraqi
people, through their free will, decide if

00:16:00.290 --> 00:16:03.810
they want to have regional governments,

00:16:03.810 --> 00:16:06.870
kind of, we think that Federation, with

00:16:06.870 --> 00:16:13.839
democracy are necessary for building a
multi-nation country, and without

00:16:13.839 --> 00:16:15.490
Federation and democracy, it's impossible

00:16:15.490 --> 00:16:18.740
to imagine a united, strong Iraq, with

00:16:18.740 --> 00:16:20.820
all these different nationalities and
religions, etcetera.

00:16:20.820 --> 00:16:21.370
Rachel MacMillan: Thank you. Mr. President,

00:16:21.370 --> 00:16:23.839
my name is Rachel MacMillan. I

00:16:23.839 --> 00:16:30.839
am in the Columbia College. One of the
main reasons that President Bush gave

00:16:30.860 --> 00:16:34.470
us for going to war in Iraq and for Operation

00:16:34.470 --> 00:16:36.440
Iraqi Freedom was the allegation of

00:16:36.440 --> 00:16:39.570
nuclear weapons, which we now know didn't
exist. Now, of course, in Iran and

00:16:39.570 --> 00:16:41.670
North Korea, we see large nuclear weapon

00:16:41.670 --> 00:16:45.320
arsenals being developed as well.

00:16:45.320 --> 00:16:46.980
 Do you think that if it was a basic human
rights issue, that we would have gone

00:16:46.980 --> 00:16:51.459
to Iraq in the first place, or was that

00:16:51.459 --> 00:16:56.670
lie actually needed to garner international

00:16:56.670 --> 00:16:59.279
support and attention?

00:16:59.279 --> 00:17:03.709
President Jalal Talabani: Well, I think

00:17:03.709 --> 00:17:07.860
there were mass destruction arms.

00:17:07.860 --> 00:17:12.789
According to our information, our own
information, there was massive chemical

00:17:12.789 --> 00:17:16.500
weapons, which was used against Kurdish

00:17:16.500 --> 00:17:19.389
people in Halajan, against Iranians

00:17:19.389 --> 00:17:26.389
and against South of Iraq. And there was
also, in the (inaudible), biological

00:17:30.669 --> 00:17:37.669
weapons also. Now we are discovering graves,

00:17:38.490 --> 00:17:42.130
for example, that contain the

00:17:42.130 --> 00:17:48.130
children between six to, one to six year,
some other six to 12, some 12 to 18.

00:17:48.130 --> 00:17:52.150
We think that there was a kind of exercise

00:17:52.150 --> 00:17:55.260
of the chemical and the biological

00:17:55.260 --> 00:17:59.840
weapons. We were sure that there were
chemical weapons and there were

00:17:59.840 --> 00:18:02.010
biological weapons. But they could hide

00:18:02.010 --> 00:18:02.260
them.

00:18:02.150 --> 00:18:06.460
You know, Iraq is a big country. This

00:18:06.460 --> 00:18:11.010
is one. The second, I think liberating 27

00:18:11.010 --> 00:18:18.010
million Iraqis and building a democratic
center in Middle East was deserving to

00:18:21.880 --> 00:18:26.660
be, to participate in this war of liberation.

00:18:26.660 --> 00:18:28.179
And don't forget that this is a tradition

00:18:28.179 --> 00:18:31.510
of American people. America participated
in the Second World War, first World

00:18:31.510 --> 00:18:33.870
War, in Asia, liberating Afghanistan and

00:18:33.870 --> 00:18:34.910
Belkan, in many places. That's the

00:18:34.910 --> 00:18:40.500
glorious people of the world. They have
their own responsibility to pay the price

00:18:40.500 --> 00:18:44.320
of it. Although I'm sorry for all kinds

00:18:44.320 --> 00:18:44.860
of American casualties.

00:18:44.860 --> 00:18:45.110
Lee Bollinger: Yes.

00:18:44.919 --> 00:18:45.169
Student: President, I'm international

00:18:44.990 --> 00:18:48.410
student in the School of Engineering and,

00:18:48.410 --> 00:18:55.320
from Turkey. So, I wonder what you exactly
meant in the beginning of your

00:18:55.320 --> 00:18:58.049
speech with Kurdistan?

00:18:58.049 --> 00:19:01.240
President Jalal Talabani: Pardon?

00:19:01.240 --> 00:19:06.990
Student: What you meant exactly in the

00:19:06.990 --> 00:19:09.390
speech of, in the beginning of your

00:19:09.390 --> 00:19:09.640
speech, as Kurdistan.

00:19:09.500 --> 00:19:09.970
President Jalal Talabani: Kurdistan is

00:19:09.970 --> 00:19:12.210
a country. I didn't create it. God created

00:19:12.210 --> 00:19:19.210
it. A few in Turkey denying it. It doesn't
mean that it's not existing. This even at

00:19:19.340 --> 00:19:20.960
the time of command pressure (inaudible)

00:19:20.960 --> 00:19:23.940
was recognize that, go back to the first

00:19:23.940 --> 00:19:28.780
building of Turkish National Assembly,
you will see on the wall, the list of military,

00:19:28.780 --> 00:19:32.590
Kurdistan military. This country is now

00:19:32.590 --> 00:19:36.030
a part of it in Iraq. This part of Iraq is

00:19:36.030 --> 00:19:42.120
officially recognize it. We have a regional
government of Kurdistan, and this

00:19:42.120 --> 00:19:46.460
original, we have also a National Assembly

00:19:46.460 --> 00:19:49.340
of Kurdistan that we are recognizing

00:19:49.340 --> 00:19:52.510
in Iraq. We don't want to interfere in
your own affairs. If you don't want to

00:19:52.510 --> 00:19:55.780
recognize it, it's up to you. But we have

00:19:55.780 --> 00:19:56.549
Kurdistan as a part of Iraq.

00:19:56.549 --> 00:19:58.220
Lee Bollinger: Yes?

00:19:58.220 --> 00:20:00.450
Nate Jennings: Welcome, Mr. President.

00:20:00.450 --> 00:20:02.669
My name's Nate Jennings. I'm an

00:20:02.669 --> 00:20:06.460
undergraduate student in the engineering
school. You spoke a little bit about the

00:20:06.460 --> 00:20:10.250
Constitution in your speech. And I was

00:20:10.250 --> 00:20:13.790
wondering if you could address what the

00:20:13.790 --> 00:20:17.520
major impediments are to having some kind
of consensus. I know you said not,

00:20:17.520 --> 00:20:20.929
there's never a case where everyone can

00:20:20.929 --> 00:20:24.700
be happy. But what do you see as

00:20:24.700 --> 00:20:29.620
being the major problems from having,
I guess widespread consensus?

00:20:29.620 --> 00:20:33.809
President Jalal Talabani: Yeah, the major

00:20:33.809 --> 00:20:34.990
problems was first the relation

00:20:34.990 --> 00:20:37.140
between state and religion. Some people
say, insisted that Iraq must be an

00:20:37.140 --> 00:20:39.750
Islamic regime, and some people wanted

00:20:39.750 --> 00:20:43.510
to say that Islam is the main source of

00:20:43.510 --> 00:20:50.200
the laws in Iraq. It was one of the big
shifts in the discussion. Second was,

00:20:50.200 --> 00:20:54.169
some Sunni Arabs refuse consideration

00:20:54.169 --> 00:20:58.880
for the South. They recognize a

00:20:58.880 --> 00:21:03.190
federation for Kurdistan because they
said federation is existing since a long time

00:21:03.190 --> 00:21:08.650
in Kurdistan. It is a reality to de facto.

00:21:08.650 --> 00:21:12.160
But they denied right of having original

00:21:12.160 --> 00:21:16.660
government for the people of the South.
The third, about the relation between

00:21:16.660 --> 00:21:20.360
Iraq and Arab World. What we have agreed

00:21:20.360 --> 00:21:22.880
with the secretary-general of Arab

00:21:22.880 --> 00:21:27.880
League was Iraq is a founding member,
enacted member of the League of Arab

00:21:27.880 --> 00:21:30.990
Leagues, and committed to the charter

00:21:30.990 --> 00:21:36.220
and the decisions of Arab League. Some

00:21:36.220 --> 00:21:42.020
people want to say that Iraq as a part
of Arab nation, by denying the existence of

00:21:42.020 --> 00:21:46.570
Kurds, Kurdanians, Turkomans, Assyrians,

00:21:46.570 --> 00:21:49.650
etcetera. That was the three main

00:21:49.650 --> 00:21:51.650
issues

00:21:51.660 --> 00:21:57.660
in the way of reaching a consensus on the
Constitution.

00:21:58.299 --> 00:21:58.340
Lee Bollinger: Yes.

00:21:59.340 --> 00:22:04.340
Hallah Al-Zaraf: Mr. President, my name
is Hallah Al-Zaraf. I am an Iraqi

00:22:04.480 --> 00:22:10.480
Fulbright student. I major in health
policy, and if you allow me sir, I will speak

00:22:10.910 --> 00:22:16.740
in English, and then give me the pleasure
of talking in Arabic to our president. As

00:22:16.860 --> 00:22:21.860
an Iraqi Arab Muslim Shi'a woman, I feel

00:22:21.960 --> 00:22:24.320
so privileged to stand here and talk to

00:22:24.320 --> 00:22:28.570
you because this is the first time I have
a chance to talk a president and I have

00:22:28.330 --> 00:22:32.580
passed my 40 years. I never wanted to
speak to the president before, but I am

00:22:33.350 --> 00:22:37.600
greatly honored to be here and talk to
you. I'm doing masters, I left a family

00:22:38.370 --> 00:22:42.620
behind. I'm doing it basically for Iraq.
I want to go back as soon as possible and

00:22:43.390 --> 00:22:47.640
try to do something and participate with
all the good efforts. I have the worry,

00:22:48.400 --> 00:22:52.650
being a woman, being, you know, I don't
know what's going to happen to the

00:22:53.419 --> 00:22:58.669
Constitution, the draft, but I do acknowledge
that there are women leadership. I

00:22:59.429 --> 00:23:03.679
mean, the existence of the First Lady
here is something we would have never

00:23:04.440 --> 00:23:06.690
thought it would happen, and the lady
minister.

00:23:07.450 --> 00:23:16.700
How can we be-- (applause) what assurances

00:23:17.460 --> 00:23:20.710
could we have in light of what you

00:23:21.470 --> 00:23:26.720
have said about the dominance of the cleric,
very strong fundamental attitude

00:23:27.480 --> 00:23:28.730
towards women participation in Iraq? What

00:23:29.490 --> 00:23:31.740
is our assurance if we go back? And

00:23:32.500 --> 00:23:33.340
thank you very much. I don't know if I
need to it in Arabic. (speaks Arabic)

00:23:34.340 --> 00:23:36.590
President Jalal Talabani: Well, I am,
no, no, I am, I'm proud to have you with

00:23:37.390 --> 00:23:46.880
us here, an Iraqi woman from Shi'ite section
of Iraq, and proud to, to see lady like

00:23:47.880 --> 00:23:51.130
you express this attitude very frankly.

00:23:51.090 --> 00:23:52.809
And I'd like to tell you that according in

00:23:52.809 --> 00:23:58.480
institution, many rights of women is insured.
Equality among men and women.

00:23:58.480 --> 00:24:02.320
The right to have 25 person of Parliament

00:24:02.320 --> 00:24:05.080
from women. Of course this will reflect

00:24:05.080 --> 00:24:09.960
in government. Now we have about six ministers,
ladies. Six ladies ministers in

00:24:09.960 --> 00:24:11.490
the--we'll have the (inaudible) prime

00:24:11.490 --> 00:24:15.809
minister, a lady also. And we have many

00:24:15.809 --> 00:24:22.809
members in the, ladies in the National
Assembly. And also, we indirectly put in

00:24:24.110 --> 00:24:27.789
the Constitution that this Constitution

00:24:27.789 --> 00:24:30.929
will respect the universal declaration of

00:24:30.929 --> 00:24:37.929
human rights, which it had a lot of rights
of women in it. And also, the women are

00:24:38.000 --> 00:24:41.929
free to choose in their marriage and their

00:24:41.929 --> 00:24:45.570
divorce, unlikely divorce of course to

00:24:45.570 --> 00:24:49.490
choose if they want to go to Civil Court
or to go to the mosque.

00:24:49.490 --> 00:24:50.440
Hallah Al-Zaraf: One more last thing,

00:24:50.440 --> 00:24:50.789
please allow me to ask--

00:24:50.789 --> 00:24:51.720
President Jalal Talabani: And of course,

00:24:51.720 --> 00:24:53.650
you know, my dear sister, you know

00:24:53.650 --> 00:24:59.970
that in Iraq we have now a strong movement,
but I must be honest with you, they

00:24:59.970 --> 00:25:02.190
are not denying the fundamental rights

00:25:02.190 --> 00:25:04.490
of women. There are some kinds of

00:25:04.490 --> 00:25:05.309
differences, as you know.

00:25:05.309 --> 00:25:06.789
 Hallah Al-Zaraf: Yes. And this is, this

00:25:06.789 --> 00:25:07.049
is the worry.

00:25:07.049 --> 00:25:08.559
President Jalal Talabani: But we are trying

00:25:08.559 --> 00:25:10.110
to receive compromise on it.

00:25:10.110 --> 00:25:11.830
Hallah Al-Zaraf: And *sha Allah, He will

00:25:11.830 --> 00:25:12.490
succeed. Thank you very much.

00:25:12.490 --> 00:25:12.740
President Jalal Talabani: We will do.

00:25:12.710 --> 00:25:12.960
Thank you.

00:25:12.870 --> 00:25:13.429
Hallah Al-Zaraf: And please accept the

00:25:13.429 --> 00:25:13.860
great greetings from other Iraqi

00:25:13.860 --> 00:25:14.659
 Fulbrighters who are studying in Texas,
Massachusetts, Michigan, this is a great

00:25:14.659 --> 00:25:15.280
opportunity to be here and talk to you

00:25:15.280 --> 00:25:16.120
personally.

00:25:16.120 --> 00:25:23.039
President Jalal Talabani: Give all of

00:25:23.039 --> 00:25:23.450
them regards--

00:25:23.450 --> 00:25:26.140
Hallah Al-Zaraf: Thank you very much.

00:25:26.140 --> 00:25:29.299
President Jalal Talabani: --and my love.

00:25:29.299 --> 00:25:32.470
Hallah Al-Zaraf: Thank you very much,

00:25:32.470 --> 00:25:33.530
Mr. President. (applause)

00:25:33.530 --> 00:25:36.100
Lee Bollinger: The, the president has

00:25:36.100 --> 00:25:38.299
time for just two more questions. Yes?

00:25:38.299 --> 00:25:41.100
Emil Rove: My name is Emil Rove. I am

00:25:41.100 --> 00:25:42.860
an International Undergraduate

00:25:42.860 --> 00:25:47.440
Student in Columbia College. Mr. President,
it is known that you have distanced

00:25:47.440 --> 00:25:48.909
yourself from the Kurdish Independence

00:25:48.909 --> 00:25:50.460
Movement for the sake of working with

00:25:50.460 --> 00:25:53.909
different ethnic groups during the process
of rebuilding Iraq. What I am

00:25:53.909 --> 00:25:57.559
wondering is what your standards are going

00:25:57.559 --> 00:26:00.270
to be in the future concerning the

00:26:00.270 --> 00:26:01.650
Kurdish Independence Movement.

00:26:01.650 --> 00:26:04.909
President Jalal Talabani: Well, my dear

00:26:04.909 --> 00:26:11.909
friend. I had my struggle all my life, I

00:26:12.340 --> 00:26:17.600
was struggling for democracy in Iraq and
Kurdish rights within the framework of

00:26:17.600 --> 00:26:22.679
Iraq. I was convinced that Kurdish people,

00:26:22.679 --> 00:26:24.850
who forcibly divided in the Middle

00:26:24.850 --> 00:26:29.330
East, has the right to serve this nation
like others. But, it's impossible today to

00:26:29.330 --> 00:26:33.150
think about independent Kurdistan. I never

00:26:33.150 --> 00:26:34.900
asked for independent Kurdistan

00:26:34.900 --> 00:26:38.409
because I know it's impossible to--I can
give you one example now. Let us

00:26:38.409 --> 00:26:41.530
imagine, tomorrow, the National Assembly

00:26:41.530 --> 00:26:45.710
of Kurdistan decides declaring

00:26:45.710 --> 00:26:52.710
independence, if our neighbors don't fight
us, but close the border, how it can

00:26:53.520 --> 00:26:56.760
come back to you again to be here in this

00:26:56.760 --> 00:26:58.710
presence. For example, we must be

00:26:58.710 --> 00:27:02.740
realistic. We must struggle for what is
possible, achievable of the mass of

00:27:02.740 --> 00:27:04.789
Kurdish people, and rethink the best is

00:27:04.789 --> 00:27:08.870
democracy for Iraq and federation within

00:27:08.870 --> 00:27:12.990
the framework of Iraq as a part of Kurdistan
also. Thank you very much.

00:27:12.990 --> 00:27:14.510
Lee Bollinger: Yes?

00:27:14.510 --> 00:27:15.350
Crystal Foray: President. Thank you for

00:27:15.350 --> 00:27:16.100
coming today. My name is Crystal

00:27:16.100 --> 00:27:23.100
Foray, and I'm a graduate student at the
School of Social Work, concentrating in

00:27:23.200 --> 00:27:24.630
International Social Welfare. In your

00:27:24.630 --> 00:27:26.610
speech, you said that there was no specific

00:27:26.610 --> 00:27:27.600
time frame to pull the troops out of Iraq.
So my question for you is in your

00:27:27.600 --> 00:27:28.120
opinion, what exactly would need to take

00:27:28.120 --> 00:27:32.080
place in order for our troops to come

00:27:32.080 --> 00:27:33.320
home? Thank you.

00:27:33.320 --> 00:27:38.539
President Jalal Talabani: I think the

00:27:38.539 --> 00:27:42.150
best thing we can do is that to train our

00:27:42.150 --> 00:27:47.500
forces and to prepare Iraqi Armed Forces
for combating against terrorism and

00:27:47.500 --> 00:27:51.559
defending this sovereignty independent

00:27:51.559 --> 00:27:53.720
of the country. And of course, there

00:27:53.720 --> 00:27:59.169
must be always a kind of consultation
and negotiation among coalition forces in

00:27:59.169 --> 00:28:02.880
Iraqi to reach agreement when it will

00:28:02.880 --> 00:28:07.010
be necessary to remove. But I think when

00:28:07.010 --> 00:28:12.650
anyone's starting a noble mission, it
must be finished successfully. Thank you

00:28:12.650 --> 00:28:13.130
very much.

00:28:13.130 --> 00:28:16.110
Lee Bollinger: Mr. President, let me just

00:28:16.110 --> 00:28:19.429
say that it is a great pleasure and

00:28:19.429 --> 00:28:24.610
honor for us to have you here today and
to spend this time. It is interesting.

00:28:24.610 --> 00:28:26.750
We're working on a project as part of

00:28:26.750 --> 00:28:29.630
the World Leaders' Forum to have women

00:28:29.630 --> 00:28:33.880
from the Iraqi legislature come and speak
at Columbia at some point in this year.

00:28:33.880 --> 00:28:37.539
This, of course, with the issues that

00:28:37.539 --> 00:28:40.620
have been raised, speak to great questions

00:28:40.620 --> 00:28:46.299
in the United States and the world, issues
of multilateralism, issues of

00:28:46.299 --> 00:28:50.029
democracy, issues of free markets, issues

00:28:50.029 --> 00:28:52.480
of intelligence. These are questions

00:28:52.480 --> 00:28:56.789
that are being debated throughout America
at this time, as you know. For you to

00:28:56.789 --> 00:28:58.610
come here and spend this time with us

00:28:58.610 --> 00:29:01.100
and to answer questions so forthrightly

00:29:01.100 --> 00:29:04.440
and freely, we deeply appreciate it, and
thank you all for coming to join us.

00:29:04.440 --> 00:29:04.690
President Jalal Talabani: Thank you, Mr.

00:29:04.570 --> 00:29:04.820
President. (applause) You are very

00:29:04.650 --> 00:29:05.290
kind. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you.
Thank you.
