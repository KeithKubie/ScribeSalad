since I started science trying to

00:01:07.460 --> 00:01:07.470
since I started science trying to
 

00:01:07.470 --> 00:01:09.910
since I started science trying to
understand how nerve cells in the brain

00:01:09.910 --> 00:01:09.920
understand how nerve cells in the brain
 

00:01:09.920 --> 00:01:13.450
understand how nerve cells in the brain
communicate with each other so our

00:01:13.450 --> 00:01:13.460
communicate with each other so our
 

00:01:13.460 --> 00:01:16.160
communicate with each other so our
contribution to science and a broad

00:01:16.160 --> 00:01:16.170
contribution to science and a broad
 

00:01:16.170 --> 00:01:19.760
contribution to science and a broad
sense was to shed light on how a nerve

00:01:19.760 --> 00:01:19.770
sense was to shed light on how a nerve
 

00:01:19.770 --> 00:01:22.670
sense was to shed light on how a nerve
cell speaks to another nerve cell and

00:01:22.670 --> 00:01:22.680
cell speaks to another nerve cell and
 

00:01:22.680 --> 00:01:26.840
cell speaks to another nerve cell and
the way a nerve cell does that is via

00:01:26.840 --> 00:01:26.850
the way a nerve cell does that is via
 

00:01:26.850 --> 00:01:30.140
the way a nerve cell does that is via
the specialized connection that is

00:01:30.140 --> 00:01:30.150
the specialized connection that is
 

00:01:30.150 --> 00:01:32.330
the specialized connection that is
formed between these cells in the brain

00:01:32.330 --> 00:01:32.340
formed between these cells in the brain
 

00:01:32.340 --> 00:01:34.609
formed between these cells in the brain
and that connection is called a synapse

00:01:34.609 --> 00:01:34.619
and that connection is called a synapse
 

00:01:34.619 --> 00:01:39.109
and that connection is called a synapse
and the synapse transfers information

00:01:39.109 --> 00:01:39.119
and the synapse transfers information
 

00:01:39.119 --> 00:01:41.870
and the synapse transfers information
and processes information from one nerve

00:01:41.870 --> 00:01:41.880
and processes information from one nerve
 

00:01:41.880 --> 00:01:46.149
and processes information from one nerve
cell to the next it is a specialized

00:01:46.149 --> 00:01:46.159
cell to the next it is a specialized
 

00:01:46.159 --> 00:01:49.730
cell to the next it is a specialized
junction between nerve cells there is

00:01:49.730 --> 00:01:49.740
junction between nerve cells there is
 

00:01:49.740 --> 00:01:53.780
junction between nerve cells there is
not only there to relay information but

00:01:53.780 --> 00:01:53.790
not only there to relay information but
 

00:01:53.790 --> 00:01:56.630
not only there to relay information but
also to change information it's it's own

00:01:56.630 --> 00:01:56.640
also to change information it's it's own
 

00:01:56.640 --> 00:01:59.450
also to change information it's it's own

little nano computer if you want to call
 

00:01:59.460 --> 00:02:03.499
little nano computer if you want to call
it that and what we have done is to try

00:02:03.499 --> 00:02:03.509
it that and what we have done is to try
 

00:02:03.509 --> 00:02:09.949
it that and what we have done is to try
to understand better how one cell sends

00:02:09.949 --> 00:02:09.959
to understand better how one cell sends
 

00:02:09.959 --> 00:02:12.230
to understand better how one cell sends
out the information to the next at

00:02:12.230 --> 00:02:12.240
out the information to the next at
 

00:02:12.240 --> 00:02:16.280
out the information to the next at
synapse and ideally how also it

00:02:16.280 --> 00:02:16.290
synapse and ideally how also it
 

00:02:16.290 --> 00:02:20.480
synapse and ideally how also it
processes that information and our major

00:02:20.480 --> 00:02:20.490
processes that information and our major
 

00:02:20.490 --> 00:02:24.140
processes that information and our major
contributions I believe was in figuring

00:02:24.140 --> 00:02:24.150
contributions I believe was in figuring
 

00:02:24.150 --> 00:02:26.950
contributions I believe was in figuring
out the basic fundamental molecular

00:02:26.950 --> 00:02:26.960
out the basic fundamental molecular
 

00:02:26.960 --> 00:02:31.730
out the basic fundamental molecular

to understand how brain cells
 

00:02:50.700 --> 00:02:53.510
to understand how brain cells
communicate yes and how exactly what's

how does their activity affect the

how does their activity affect the

how does their activity affect the
overall brain and how does that change

00:03:09.020 --> 00:03:09.030
overall brain and how does that change
