00:00:04.004 --> 00:00:06.215
&gt;&gt; Larry: WELCOME BACK.

00:00:06.215 --> 00:00:08.133
VERY EXCITING RIGHT NOW.

00:00:08.133 --> 00:00:10.928
BECAUSE WE ARE TRYING A NEW
SEGMENT ON TONIGHT'S SHOW THAT

00:00:10.928 --> 00:00:15.641
COMBINES TWO OF MY GREATEST
PASSIONS, BOOKS AND OUTER SPACE.

00:00:15.641 --> 00:00:21.188
&gt;&gt; WELCOME TO L-DUB'S BOOK CLUB
IN SPACE!

00:00:21.188 --> 00:00:27.653
[ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ]
&gt;&gt; Larry: WELCOME.

00:00:27.653 --> 00:00:30.614
WELCOME TO L-DUB'S BOOK CLUB IN
SPACE.

00:00:30.614 --> 00:00:34.743
NOW, I WANT TO BE CLEAR THAT
THIS IS A NORMAL BOOK CLUB

00:00:34.743 --> 00:00:37.371
SEGMENT THAT WE ARE STARTING
TONIGHT THAT JUST HAPPENS TO BE

00:00:37.371 --> 00:00:40.290
SET IN SPACE, BECAUSE LIKE I
SAID, I LOVE SPACE AND WE HAD

00:00:40.290 --> 00:00:42.292
THE BUDGET FOR IT.

00:00:42.292 --> 00:00:44.795
AND IT'S JUST HAPPENS TO BE A
FORTUNATE COINCIDENCE THAT OUR

00:00:44.795 --> 00:00:49.341
FIRST GUEST IS LEGENDARY
ASTRONAUT AND ONE OF MY 

00:00:49.341 --> 00:00:51.176
CHILDHOOD HEROES, BUZZ ALDRIN.

00:00:51.176 --> 00:01:03.814
[ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ]
&gt;&gt; Larry: OKAY.

00:01:03.814 --> 00:01:05.274
LOOK.

00:01:05.274 --> 00:01:07.317
SO, BUZZ, YOU HAVE WRITTEN A
BOOK CALLED "WELCOME TO MARS",

00:01:07.317 --> 00:01:07.985
RIGHT?

00:01:07.985 --> 00:01:08.527
&gt;&gt; THAT'S RIGHT, YES.

00:01:08.527 --> 00:01:10.028
&gt;&gt; Larry: GREAT.

00:01:10.028 --> 00:01:12.364
AND THAT IS INTENDED TO GET KIDS
EXCITED ABOUT SPACE TRAVEL.

00:01:12.364 --> 00:01:13.615
IN FACT, HOLD ON A SECOND.

00:01:13.615 --> 00:01:16.368
I THINK THIS IS GOING TO BE A
FLY BY OF YOUR BOOK.

00:01:16.368 --> 00:01:17.995
IN THREE, TWO, ONE.

00:01:17.995 --> 00:01:20.205
OH, THERE IT GOES, THERE IT
GOES.

00:01:20.205 --> 00:01:20.747
THERE GOES THE BOOK.

00:01:20.747 --> 00:01:23.000
&gt;&gt; GET IT!

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:23.625
&gt;&gt; WAY.

00:01:23.625 --> 00:01:24.835
&gt;&gt; WHERE DID IT GO?

00:01:24.835 --> 00:01:25.627
&gt;&gt; Larry: THERE IT IS.

00:01:25.627 --> 00:01:26.795
OKAY.

00:01:26.795 --> 00:01:28.839
SO THAT A IS YOUR BOOK.  SO LET
ME ASK YOU.

00:01:28.839 --> 00:01:35.637
SO WHAT -- BUZZ, WHAT IS YOUR
BOOK ABOUT, BASICALLY?  WHAT ARE

00:01:35.637 --> 00:01:36.722
YOU TRYING TO ACCOMPLISH WITH
YOUR BOOK?

00:01:36.722 --> 00:01:38.765
&gt;&gt; WELL, IT IS ABOUT MARS.

00:01:38.765 --> 00:01:39.975
&gt;&gt; Larry: YEAH.

00:01:39.975 --> 00:01:42.269
&gt;&gt; IT IS ABOUT INSPIRING KIDS
FOR THE FUTURE.

00:01:42.269 --> 00:01:43.729
&gt;&gt; Larry: FOR THE FUTURE.

00:01:43.729 --> 00:01:47.065
&gt;&gt; BECAUSE THEY ARE THE ONES WHO
WILL BE HELPING TO MAKE IT

00:01:47.065 --> 00:01:47.608
HAPPEN.

00:01:47.608 --> 00:01:49.109
&gt;&gt; Larry: SURE.

00:01:49.109 --> 00:01:53.613
&gt;&gt; AND MAYBE GOING ALONG AND I
WANT TO WELCOME THEM WHEN THEY

00:01:53.613 --> 00:01:54.114
GET THERE.

00:01:54.114 --> 00:01:55.449
TO MARS

00:01:55.449 --> 00:01:56.450
&gt;&gt; Larry: THAT WOULD BE
AWESOME IF YOU ARE THERE TO

00:01:56.450 --> 00:01:58.160
WELCOME THE KIDS.

00:01:58.160 --> 00:02:01.413
&gt;&gt; THAT WOULD BE THE MOST
AWESOME THING EVER.

00:02:01.413 --> 00:02:03.874
SO WHY DO THEY NEED TO BE
EXCITED ABOUT SPACE?  DO YOU

00:02:03.874 --> 00:02:06.585
THINK PEOPLE AREN'T EXCITED
ABOUT SPACE ANYMORE?  THAT'S THE

00:02:06.585 --> 00:02:07.210
PROBLEM.

00:02:07.210 --> 00:02:09.921
&gt;&gt; AH, IT IS HO-HUM

00:02:09.921 --> 00:02:10.714
&gt;&gt; HO-HUM.

00:02:10.714 --> 00:02:11.882
&gt;&gt; NOTHING TO DO.

00:02:11.882 --> 00:02:15.886
&gt;&gt; WE CAN'T EVEN FLY IN OUR OWN
SPACECRAFTS.

00:02:15.886 --> 00:02:17.095
WE HAVE TO PAY THE RUSSIANS TO
GET THERE.

00:02:17.095 --> 00:02:20.766
&gt;&gt; Larry: WE HAVE THE TESLA
GUYS MAKING THEM AND THE VIRGIN

00:02:20.766 --> 00:02:21.892
FLIGHT GUYS MAKING THEM.

00:02:21.892 --> 00:02:24.353
IT IS HARD FOR NASA TO GET
FUNDING.

00:02:24.353 --> 00:02:26.938
WHY DO YOU THINK THE GOVERNMENT
IS SO DOWN ON NASA?  WHY DO THEY

00:02:26.938 --> 00:02:30.692
HAVE TO HATE ON NASA?  WHAT IS
GOING ON WITH THAT?

00:02:30.692 --> 00:02:32.778
&gt;&gt; THE PEOPLE HAVE LOST THEIR
ENTHUSIASM.

00:02:32.778 --> 00:02:34.071
&gt;&gt; Larry: REALLY?

00:02:34.071 --> 00:02:37.407
&gt;&gt; AND THE PEOPLE VOTE FOR THE
PEOPLE IN CONGRESS.

00:02:37.407 --> 00:02:38.742
&gt;&gt; Larry: RIGHT.

00:02:38.742 --> 00:02:43.246
&gt;&gt; RIGHT?  YOU ARE BEGINNING TO
GET THOUSAND WORKS?

00:02:43.246 --> 00:02:45.916
&gt;&gt; TO GET HOW THIS WORKS?

00:02:45.916 --> 00:02:48.627
&gt;&gt; AND THE PEOPLE VOTE FOR THE
PEOPLE WHO GIVE THEM THE MONEY.

00:02:48.627 --> 00:02:50.921
&gt;&gt; Larry: PEOPLE VOTE FOR THE
PEOPLE WHO GIVE THEM THE MONEY.

00:02:50.921 --> 00:02:52.881
&gt;&gt; SO THERE IS NO MONEY LEFT.

00:02:52.881 --> 00:02:54.341
&gt;&gt; Larry: NO MONEY LEFT.

00:02:54.341 --> 00:02:57.302
SO THAT'S WHY -- WHEN I WAS A
KID PEOPLE WERE SO EXCITED.  TO

00:02:57.302 --> 00:03:00.472
ME THERE WAS NOTHING MORE
EXCITING THAN THE SPACE RACE.

00:03:00.472 --> 00:03:01.973
OKAY.

00:03:01.973 --> 00:03:03.809
I WANT TO ASK YOU, YOU ARE AN
EXPERT ON THIS, NO, THE SPACE

00:03:03.809 --> 00:03:07.104
RACE, THERE IS IS NOTHING MORE
EXCITING THAN THAT.

00:03:07.104 --> 00:03:10.107
WHAT DO YOU THINK IS MORE
EXCITING -- OH, THE BOOK WENT BY

00:03:10.107 --> 00:03:10.732
AGAIN.

00:03:10.732 --> 00:03:11.441
&gt;&gt; WHERE DID IT GO?

00:03:11.441 --> 00:03:13.443
&gt;&gt; Larry: WAIT A SECOND.

00:03:13.443 --> 00:03:14.903
I THINK IT IS WITHIN REACH.
THERE'S A BREACH IN HERE

00:03:14.903 --> 00:03:17.280
WAIT A SECOND.

00:03:17.280 --> 00:03:17.614
OH.

00:03:17.614 --> 00:03:20.575
&gt;&gt; OH.

00:03:20.575 --> 00:03:21.701
&gt;&gt; OH.

00:03:21.701 --> 00:03:22.911
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; Larry: WE GOT A COPY OF

00:03:22.911 --> 00:03:24.704
YOUR BOOK.

00:03:24.704 --> 00:03:26.623
&gt;&gt; YOU GRAB THINGS ALL THE TIME?

00:03:26.623 --> 00:03:28.458
&gt;&gt; Larry: YES, I BET YOU DO
TOO.

00:03:28.458 --> 00:03:30.711
&gt;&gt; NO.

00:03:30.711 --> 00:03:33.964
I THOUGHT I WAS GOING TO BE IN A
CORN FIELD.

00:03:33.964 --> 00:03:36.383
ON A TREADMILL.

00:03:36.383 --> 00:03:39.428
&gt;&gt; IN NEW JERSEY -- A NEW JERSEY
CORN FIELD.

00:03:39.428 --> 00:03:43.014
&gt;&gt; Larry: DON'T GIVE AWAY OUR
SECRETS, BUZZ!  THERE IS NO

00:03:43.014 --> 00:03:43.598
TREADMILL.

00:03:43.598 --> 00:03:44.474
OKAY.

00:03:44.474 --> 00:03:47.978
HERE IS WHAT I WANT TO ASK YOU.

00:03:47.978 --> 00:03:49.438
OKAY.

00:03:49.438 --> 00:03:53.358
&gt;&gt; SPEAKING OF SECRETS, DO YOU
BELIEVE IN EXTRATERRESTRIAL

00:03:53.358 --> 00:03:59.197
LIFE, DID YOU GUYS SEE ANYTHING
ON THE MOON?  KEEP IT 100.

00:03:59.197 --> 00:04:02.200
&gt;&gt; NEIL HAD THE CAMERA MOST OF
THE TIME.

00:04:02.200 --> 00:04:03.994
AND YOU HAVE TO LOOK AT HIS
PICTURE.

00:04:03.994 --> 00:04:05.412
HE TOOK A GOOD PICTURE OF ME.

00:04:05.412 --> 00:04:07.456
YOU KNOW WHAT MADE IT SO FAMOUS?

00:04:07.456 --> 00:04:08.331
&gt;&gt; Larry: WHAT IS THAT?

00:04:08.331 --> 00:04:14.254
&gt;&gt; LOCATION, LOCATION, LOCATION.

00:04:14.254 --> 00:04:16.047
&gt;&gt; Larry: DO YOU THINK THERE
IS LIFE ON MARS?  DO YOU THINK

00:04:16.047 --> 00:04:18.133
WE WILL FIND INTELLIGENT LIFE ON
MARS?

00:04:18.133 --> 00:04:21.761
&gt;&gt; THERE WILL BE.

00:04:21.761 --> 00:04:23.096
THEN.

00:04:23.096 --> 00:04:26.266
OF COURSE WHEN I GET THEM THERE
WITH MY SPACECRAFT.

00:04:26.266 --> 00:04:29.269
&gt;&gt; Larry: WHEN DO YOU THINK WE
WILL FIND INTELLIGENT LIFE ON

00:04:29.269 --> 00:04:30.270
EARTH?

00:04:30.270 --> 00:04:33.940
&gt;&gt; WE HAVE GOT TO LOOK A LONG
TIME.

00:04:33.940 --> 00:04:35.901
YOU KNOW, I WENT DOWN TO THE
"TITANIC".

00:04:35.901 --> 00:04:37.444
&gt;&gt; Larry: YOU WENT TO THE
TITANIC?

00:04:37.444 --> 00:04:37.861
&gt;&gt; YES, DEEP.

00:04:37.861 --> 00:04:38.945
&gt;&gt; Larry: REALLY?

00:04:38.945 --> 00:04:39.946
&gt;&gt; YEAH.

00:04:39.946 --> 00:04:41.406
I AM A DEEP THINKER.

00:04:41.406 --> 00:04:42.949
&gt;&gt; Larry: YES.

00:04:42.949 --> 00:04:45.285
YOU WENT TO THE DEEPEST PART OF
SPACE AND THE DEEPEST PARTS OF

00:04:45.285 --> 00:04:46.787
THE EARTH.

00:04:46.787 --> 00:04:49.331
WHAT WAS MORE EXCITING DEEP
SPACE TRAVEL OR DEEP-SEA TRAVEL?

00:04:49.331 --> 00:04:50.165
WHAT WAS MORE EXCITING.

00:04:50.165 --> 00:04:50.957
&gt;&gt; WELL.

00:04:50.957 --> 00:04:52.501
&gt;&gt; Larry: OR MORE DANGEROUS?

00:04:52.501 --> 00:04:57.714
&gt;&gt; MAN, I WISH I BROUGHT A SLIDE
WITH ME BECAUSE I HAVE A SLIDE

00:04:57.714 --> 00:05:00.091
WHERE I AM RIDING ON A WHALE

00:05:00.091 --> 00:05:00.717
&gt;&gt; Larry: REALLY?

00:05:00.717 --> 00:05:01.676
&gt;&gt; YES.

00:05:01.676 --> 00:05:02.802
&gt;&gt; A WHALE SHARK.

00:05:02.802 --> 00:05:05.222
&gt;&gt; Larry: THIS IS
UNBELIEVABLE.

00:05:05.222 --> 00:05:08.934
YOU ARE THE MOST INTERESTING MAN
IN THE WORLD!  RIGHT HERE!

00:05:08.934 --> 00:05:16.566
