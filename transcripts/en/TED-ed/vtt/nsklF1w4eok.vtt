00:00:06.956 --> 00:00:11.405
Cell membranes are structures 
of contradictions.

00:00:11.405 --> 00:00:16.886
These oily films are hundreds of times
thinner than a strand of spider silk,

00:00:16.886 --> 00:00:20.955
yet strong enough to protect
the delicate contents of life:

00:00:20.955 --> 00:00:25.057
the cell's watery cytoplasm, 
genetic material, organelles,

00:00:25.057 --> 00:00:28.316
and all the molecules it needs to survive.

00:00:28.316 --> 00:00:34.547
How does the membrane work,
and where does that strength come from?

00:00:34.547 --> 00:00:37.206
First of all, it's tempting to think of a
cell membrane

00:00:37.206 --> 00:00:39.637
like the tight skin of a balloon,

00:00:39.637 --> 00:00:43.027
but it's actually something 
much more complex.

00:00:43.027 --> 00:00:45.758
In reality, it's constantly in flux,

00:00:45.758 --> 00:00:49.217
shifting components back and forth
to help the cell take in food,

00:00:49.217 --> 00:00:51.135
remove waste,

00:00:51.135 --> 00:00:53.997
let specific molecules in and out,

00:00:53.997 --> 00:00:55.677
communicate with other cells,

00:00:55.677 --> 00:00:58.057
gather information about the environment,

00:00:58.057 --> 00:01:00.528
and repair itself.

00:01:00.528 --> 00:01:04.887
The cell membrane gets this resilience,
flexibility, and functionality

00:01:04.887 --> 00:01:08.488
by combining a variety 
of floating components

00:01:08.488 --> 00:01:13.117
in what biologists call a fluid mosaic.

00:01:13.117 --> 00:01:15.467
The primary component of the fluid mosaic

00:01:15.467 --> 00:01:19.100
is a simple molecule 
called a phospholipid.

00:01:19.100 --> 00:01:22.748
A phospholipid has a polar, 
electrically-charged head,

00:01:22.748 --> 00:01:24.237
which attracts water,

00:01:24.237 --> 00:01:27.600
and a non-polar tail, which repels it.

00:01:27.600 --> 00:01:31.299
They pair up tail-to-tail
in a two layer sheet

00:01:31.299 --> 00:01:37.540
just five to ten nanometers thick
that extends all around the cell.

00:01:37.540 --> 00:01:39.979
The heads point in towards the cytoplasm

00:01:39.979 --> 00:01:42.979
and out towards the watery fluid 
external to the cell

00:01:42.979 --> 00:01:47.129
with the lipid tails 
sandwiched in between.

00:01:47.129 --> 00:01:51.899
This bilayer, which at body temperature
has the consistency of vegetable oil,

00:01:51.899 --> 00:01:55.081
is studded with other types of molecules,

00:01:55.081 --> 00:01:56.359
including proteins,

00:01:56.359 --> 00:01:57.361
carbohydrates,

00:01:57.361 --> 00:02:00.042
and cholesterol.

00:02:00.042 --> 00:02:03.600
Cholesterol keeps the membrane 
at the right fluidity.

00:02:03.600 --> 00:02:07.521
It also helps regulate communication
between cells.

00:02:07.521 --> 00:02:09.521
Sometimes, cells talk to each other

00:02:09.521 --> 00:02:13.481
by releasing and capturing 
chemicals and proteins.

00:02:13.481 --> 00:02:15.371
The release of proteins is easy,

00:02:15.371 --> 00:02:18.720
but the capture of them 
is more complicated.

00:02:18.720 --> 00:02:23.090
That happens through a process called
endocytosis

00:02:23.090 --> 00:02:25.921
in which sections of the membrane
engulf substances

00:02:25.921 --> 00:02:30.313
and transport them into the cell
as vesicles.

00:02:30.313 --> 00:02:32.271
Once the contents have been released,

00:02:32.271 --> 00:02:36.701
the vesicles are recycled and returned
to the cell membrane.

00:02:36.701 --> 00:02:42.061
The most complex components
of the fluid mosaic are proteins.

00:02:42.061 --> 00:02:43.892
One of their key jobs is to make sure

00:02:43.892 --> 00:02:48.032
that the right molecules 
get in and out of the cell.

00:02:48.032 --> 00:02:50.243
Non-polar molecules, like oxygen,

00:02:50.243 --> 00:02:51.583
carbon dioxide,

00:02:51.583 --> 00:02:53.052
and certain vitamins

00:02:53.052 --> 00:02:56.812
can cross the phospholipid 
bilayer easily.

00:02:56.812 --> 00:03:02.265
But polar and charged molecules can't
make it through the fatty inner layer.

00:03:02.265 --> 00:03:06.693
Transmembrane proteins stretch
across the bilayer to create channels

00:03:06.693 --> 00:03:12.174
that allow specific molecules through,
like sodium and potassium ions.

00:03:12.174 --> 00:03:15.314
Peripheral proteins floating
in the inner face of the bilayer

00:03:15.314 --> 00:03:20.043
help anchor the membrane to the cell's
interior scaffolding.

00:03:20.043 --> 00:03:25.374
Other proteins in cell membranes
can help fuse two different bilayers.

00:03:25.374 --> 00:03:29.294
That can work to our benefit,
like when a sperm fertilizes an egg,

00:03:29.294 --> 00:03:34.455
but also harm us,
as it does when a virus enters a cell.

00:03:34.455 --> 00:03:37.235
And some proteins move within
the fluid mosaic,

00:03:37.235 --> 00:03:42.485
coming together to form complexes
that carry out specific jobs.

00:03:42.485 --> 00:03:46.465
For instance, one complex might
activate cells in our immune system,

00:03:46.465 --> 00:03:50.275
then move apart when the job is done.

00:03:50.275 --> 00:03:53.205
Cell membranes are also the site
of an ongoing war

00:03:53.205 --> 00:03:56.754
between us and all the things
that want to infect us.

00:03:56.754 --> 00:04:00.694
In fact, some of the most toxic
substances we know of

00:04:00.694 --> 00:04:05.705
are membrane-breaching proteins
made by infectious bacteria.

00:04:05.705 --> 00:04:09.785
These pore-forming toxins poke
giant holes in our cell membranes,

00:04:09.785 --> 00:04:13.605
causing a cell's contents to leak out.

00:04:13.605 --> 00:04:17.058
Scientists are working on developing
ways to defend against them,

00:04:17.058 --> 00:04:19.507
like using a nano-sponge 
that saves our cells

00:04:19.507 --> 00:04:24.486
by soaking up 
the membrane-damaging toxins.

00:04:24.486 --> 00:04:28.726
The fluid mosaic is what makes 
all the functions of life possible.

00:04:28.726 --> 00:04:32.248
Without a cell membrane,
there could be no cells,

00:04:32.248 --> 00:04:34.826
and without cells,
there would be no bacteria,

00:04:34.826 --> 00:04:36.136
no parasites,

00:04:36.136 --> 00:04:37.406
no fungi,

00:04:37.406 --> 00:04:38.746
no animals,

00:04:38.746 --> 00:04:40.728
and no us.
