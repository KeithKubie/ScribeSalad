00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.880
So now to computer with Rice's Theorem before we go back into practice,

00:00:03.880 --> 00:00:06.700
I'll give you a quiz very similar to the one we just had.

00:00:06.700 --> 00:00:08.440
All I want you to do is to figure out

00:00:08.440 --> 00:00:11.970
which of the following properties are decidable for a given program?

00:00:11.970 --> 00:00:13.830
A program always returns 1,

00:00:13.830 --> 00:00:16.070
a program solves Vertex Cover,

00:00:16.070 --> 00:00:18.980
a program adds 2 numbers, doesn't do anything,

00:00:18.980 --> 00:00:20.970
converts and MP3 file,

00:00:20.970 --> 00:00:24.330
reads a file, terminates after 3 timesteps,

00:00:24.330 --> 00:00:27.150
is a virus, writes to a file,

00:00:27.150 --> 00:00:29.600
modifies itself, returns an integer,

00:00:29.600 --> 00:00:31.250
downloads data.

00:00:31.250 --> 00:00:33.590
So please make a check mark next to those properties

00:00:33.590 --> 99:59:59.000
that are decidable, and leave the others blank.
