00:00:07.789 --> 00:00:09.454
Take a look out your window,

00:00:09.454 --> 00:00:11.447
put on your glasses if you wear them.

00:00:11.447 --> 00:00:13.492
You might want to grab a pair of binoculars, too,

00:00:13.492 --> 00:00:15.253
or a magnifying lens.

00:00:15.253 --> 00:00:16.702
Now, what do you see?

00:00:16.702 --> 00:00:18.374
Well, whatever it is,

00:00:18.374 --> 00:00:20.252
it's not the multiple layers of glass

00:00:20.252 --> 00:00:21.543
right in front of you.

00:00:21.543 --> 00:00:22.637
But have you ever wondered

00:00:22.637 --> 00:00:25.569
how something so solid can be so invisible?

00:00:25.569 --> 00:00:27.003
To understand that,

00:00:27.003 --> 00:00:29.634
we have to understand what glass actually is,

00:00:29.634 --> 00:00:31.086
and where it comes from.

00:00:31.086 --> 00:00:33.170
It all begins in the Earth's crust,

00:00:33.170 --> 00:00:35.170
where the two most common elements are

00:00:35.170 --> 00:00:37.224
silicon and oxygen.

00:00:37.224 --> 00:00:40.335
These react together to form silicon dioxide,

00:00:40.335 --> 00:00:42.189
whose molecules arrange themselves

00:00:42.189 --> 00:00:45.099
into a regular crystalline form known as quartz.

00:00:45.099 --> 00:00:48.026
Quartz is commonly found in sand,

00:00:48.026 --> 00:00:50.003
where it often makes up most of the grains

00:00:50.003 --> 00:00:52.779
and is the main ingredient in most type of glass.

00:00:52.779 --> 00:00:54.948
Of course, you probably noticed that glass

00:00:54.948 --> 00:00:57.504
isn't made of multiple tiny bits of quartz,

00:00:57.504 --> 00:00:58.836
and for good reason.

00:00:58.836 --> 00:01:01.455
For one thing, the edges of the rigidly formed grains

00:01:01.455 --> 00:01:03.956
and smaller defects within the crystal structure

00:01:03.956 --> 00:01:06.670
reflect and disperse light that hits them.

00:01:06.670 --> 00:01:09.003
But when the quartz is heated high enough

00:01:09.003 --> 00:01:11.633
the extra energy makes the molecules vibrate

00:01:11.633 --> 00:01:13.753
until they break the bonds holding them together

00:01:13.753 --> 00:01:15.635
and become a flowing liquid,

00:01:15.635 --> 00:01:17.972
the same way that ice melts into water.

00:01:17.972 --> 00:01:21.253
Unlike water, though, liquid silicon dioxide

00:01:21.253 --> 00:01:24.602
does not reform into a crystal solid when it cools.

00:01:24.602 --> 00:01:27.273
Instead, as the molecules lose energy,

00:01:27.273 --> 00:01:28.831
they are less and less able

00:01:28.831 --> 00:01:30.835
to move into an ordered position,

00:01:30.835 --> 00:01:33.528
and the result is what is called an amorphous solid.

00:01:33.528 --> 00:01:37.524
A solid material with the chaotic structure of a liquid,

00:01:37.524 --> 00:01:41.107
which allows the molecules to freely fill in any gaps.

00:01:41.107 --> 00:01:43.274
This makes the surface of glass uniform

00:01:43.274 --> 00:01:44.995
on a microscopic level,

00:01:44.995 --> 00:01:46.440
allowing light to strike it

00:01:46.440 --> 00:01:49.169
without being scattered in different directions.

00:01:49.169 --> 00:01:50.691
But this still doesn't explain

00:01:50.691 --> 00:01:53.323
why light is able to pass through glass

00:01:53.323 --> 00:01:56.215
rather than being absorbed as with most solids.

00:01:56.215 --> 00:01:58.274
For that, we need to go all the way down

00:01:58.274 --> 00:02:00.010
to the subatomic level.

00:02:00.010 --> 00:02:02.554
You may know that an atom consists of a nucleus

00:02:02.554 --> 00:02:04.533
with electrons orbiting around it,

00:02:04.533 --> 00:02:06.228
but you may be surprised to know

00:02:06.228 --> 00:02:08.230
that it's mostly empty space.

00:02:08.230 --> 00:02:11.023
In fact, if an atom were the size of a sports stadium,

00:02:11.023 --> 00:02:13.817
the nucleus would be like a single pea in the center,

00:02:13.817 --> 00:02:16.403
while the electrons would be like grains of sand

00:02:16.403 --> 00:02:18.322
in the outer seats.

00:02:18.322 --> 00:02:19.606
That should leave plenty of space

00:02:19.606 --> 00:02:20.825
for light to pass through

00:02:20.825 --> 00:02:22.910
without hitting any of these particles.

00:02:22.910 --> 00:02:24.274
So the real question is not

00:02:24.274 --> 00:02:25.915
why is glass transparent,

00:02:25.915 --> 00:02:29.166
but why aren't all materials transparent?

00:02:29.166 --> 00:02:32.166
The answer has to do with the different energy levels

00:02:32.166 --> 00:02:35.024
that electrons in an atom can have.

00:02:35.024 --> 00:02:36.755
Think of these as different rows of seats

00:02:36.755 --> 00:02:38.440
in the stadium stands.

00:02:38.440 --> 00:02:41.774
An electron is initially assigned to sit in a certain row,

00:02:41.774 --> 00:02:43.763
but it could jump to a better row,

00:02:43.763 --> 00:02:45.640
if it only had the energy.

00:02:45.640 --> 00:02:47.106
As luck would have it,

00:02:47.106 --> 00:02:48.725
absorbing one of those light photons

00:02:48.725 --> 00:02:50.506
passing through the atom can provide

00:02:50.506 --> 00:02:52.691
just the energy the electron needs.

00:02:52.691 --> 00:02:54.191
But there's a catch.

00:02:54.191 --> 00:02:55.481
The energy from the photon

00:02:55.481 --> 00:02:56.984
has to be the right amount

00:02:56.984 --> 00:02:59.236
to get an electron to the next row.

00:02:59.236 --> 00:03:02.489
Otherwise, it will just let the photon pass by,

00:03:02.489 --> 00:03:04.524
and it just so happens that in glass,

00:03:04.524 --> 00:03:06.493
the rows are so far apart

00:03:06.493 --> 00:03:08.356
that a photon of visible light

00:03:08.356 --> 00:03:10.564
can't provide enough energy for an electron

00:03:10.564 --> 00:03:12.262
to jump between them.

00:03:12.262 --> 00:03:14.678
Photons from ultraviolet light, on the other hand,

00:03:14.678 --> 00:03:16.594
give just the right amount of energy,

00:03:16.594 --> 00:03:17.760
and are absorbed,

00:03:17.760 --> 00:03:20.760
which is why you can't get a suntan through glass.

00:03:20.760 --> 00:03:22.719
This amazing property of being both

00:03:22.719 --> 00:03:25.971
solid and transparent has given glass many uses

00:03:25.971 --> 00:03:27.344
throughout the centuries.

00:03:27.344 --> 00:03:28.892
From windows that let in light

00:03:28.892 --> 00:03:30.308
while keeping out the elements,

00:03:30.308 --> 00:03:32.260
to lenses that allow us to see both

00:03:32.260 --> 00:03:33.928
the vast worlds beyond our planet,

00:03:33.928 --> 00:03:36.100
and the tiny ones right around us.

00:03:36.100 --> 00:03:37.150
It is hard to imagine

00:03:37.150 --> 00:03:39.678
modern civilization without glass.

00:03:39.678 --> 00:03:41.571
And yet for such an important material

00:03:41.571 --> 00:03:44.389
we rarely think about glass and its impact.

00:03:44.389 --> 00:03:46.659
It is precisely because the most important

00:03:46.659 --> 00:03:48.436
and useful quality of glass is

00:03:48.436 --> 00:03:50.482
being featureless and invisible

00:03:50.482 --> 00:03:52.602
that we often forget that it's even there.
