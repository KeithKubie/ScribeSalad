[MUSIC]

00:00:03.340 --> 00:00:06.319
When we talk about the OMS program
we sometimes use the metaphor,

00:00:06.319 --> 00:00:08.090
where's the classroom?

00:00:08.090 --> 00:00:10.630
On campus, we have a physical classroom
and it's where the discussion,

00:00:10.630 --> 00:00:13.060
the announcements,
the lecturing all happen.

00:00:13.060 --> 00:00:16.200
In my opinion, in the OMS program,
Piazza is the classroom.

00:00:16.200 --> 00:00:19.230
The lectures are on Udacity like
a textbook and t square is there for

00:00:19.230 --> 00:00:20.880
assignments and resources.

00:00:20.880 --> 00:00:23.934
But Piazza is where we recreate the
personal interactions that are present

00:00:23.934 --> 00:00:24.960
in a typical classroom.

00:00:24.960 --> 00:00:26.790
So we'll talk about getting
started with Piazza.

00:00:26.790 --> 00:00:29.780
And we'll talk about asking questions,
reading responses, and

00:00:29.780 --> 00:00:31.480
providing answers of your own.

00:00:31.480 --> 00:00:34.790
Now, Piazza can get extremely
noisy in classes of this size, so

00:00:34.790 --> 00:00:38.200
we'll also talk about some workflows for
managing your time on Piazza.

00:00:38.200 --> 00:00:41.280
We generally recommend checking in on
Piazza each day while you're enrolled in

00:00:41.280 --> 00:00:43.370
a class, even for
only a couple of minutes.

00:00:43.370 --> 00:00:44.780
Just to see if anything
catches your eye or

00:00:44.780 --> 00:00:46.780
if there is any place you can
help your classmates out.
