00:00:00.160 --> 00:00:04.629
Fungus, typically when I say that word you
think of the stuff that grows under your toenails.

00:00:04.629 --> 00:00:09.519
It gets a bad rap as being slimy, gross, or
infectious. Okay yes, it can be all those

00:00:09.519 --> 00:00:16.590
things, but fungus is actually really cool.

00:00:16.590 --> 00:00:18.320
Hey guys Julia here for DNews

00:00:18.320 --> 00:00:22.949
Fungus is a group of organisms separate from
all other life on earth. It’s in a weird

00:00:22.949 --> 00:00:27.949
kingdom of it’s own, neither plant nor animal
nor bacteria. It’s actually more closely

00:00:27.949 --> 00:00:33.420
related to animals than plants. It includes
things like mold, yeast, and of course mushrooms.

00:00:33.420 --> 00:00:37.399
While they may be a totally different kingdom,
their existence is intertwined with other

00:00:37.399 --> 00:00:41.800
organisms, nearly all plants have some sort
of symbiotic relationship with fungus.

00:00:41.800 --> 00:00:46.620
So it’s a shame they get a lot of hate.
Fungus is great! Mycologist Paul Stamets calls

00:00:46.620 --> 00:00:50.629
the underground network of fungus "nature's
Internet" It connects lots of plants that

00:00:50.629 --> 00:00:55.579
can exchange the nutrients they need. Fungus
also plays vital roles in decomposition and

00:00:55.579 --> 00:00:59.449
might even be the key to saving the bees and
treating disease!

00:00:59.449 --> 00:01:03.539
A recent study published in the journal Current
Biology found that the Brazilian Bee needs

00:01:03.539 --> 00:01:08.860
a type of fungus to survive. Researchers noticed
a white fuzzy fungus growing in a colony.

00:01:08.860 --> 00:01:12.420
At first they thought it was invasive,
but then they noticed all 30 of their hives

00:01:12.420 --> 00:01:16.160
had the fuzz. So they did what researchers
do, they did some science.

00:01:16.160 --> 00:01:20.700
In their experiments, they raised a group
of bee larva in an environment with the fungus

00:01:20.700 --> 00:01:24.080
and a group without the fungus. They found
that the survival rate of those larva with

00:01:24.080 --> 00:01:30.450
the fungus was 72%.... without… the survival
rate dropped to just 8%. It became clear the

00:01:30.450 --> 00:01:32.420
bees need the fungus to survive.

00:01:32.420 --> 00:01:37.130
It either provides nutrients or keeps food
for the larva from spoiling. But what’s

00:01:37.130 --> 00:01:41.030
more interesting, is that when bees leave
the hive to start their own colony they take

00:01:41.030 --> 00:01:45.450
part of the fungus with them. The researchers
call it a kind of “proto-farming”.

00:01:45.450 --> 00:01:48.810
One of the researchers said ““Given the
substantial diversity of bees, many of which

00:01:48.810 --> 00:01:52.970
are poorly studied, it is likely that other
bees engage in similar associations,”

00:01:52.970 --> 00:01:58.320
And they aren’t alone. Mycologist Paul Stamets
is a man on a mission. He’s determined to

00:01:58.320 --> 00:02:02.840
save as many genomes of species of fungus
in the Pacific Northwest as possible. He believes

00:02:02.840 --> 00:02:06.600
that "The rainforests of the Pacific Northwest
may harbor mushroom species with profound

00:02:06.600 --> 00:02:10.500
medicinal properties”. But with climate
change and clear cutting of forests species

00:02:10.500 --> 00:02:15.320
of fungus might be disappearing before we
can find them, taking their medicinal secrets

00:02:15.320 --> 00:02:16.360
with them.

00:02:16.360 --> 00:02:20.340
He also believes that fungus holds the answer
to the massive bee die off known as colony

00:02:20.340 --> 00:02:24.260
collapse disorder. If you want to learn more
about the bee die off check out a video we

00:02:24.260 --> 00:02:28.580
did a while ago, there’s a link in the description.
Besides what we talk about in that video,

00:02:28.580 --> 00:02:33.060
many bee keepers find that little parasite
called the the varroa mite could be responsible.

00:02:33.060 --> 00:02:37.170
The mite carries viruses and it’s the virus
that can destroy entire colonies in just a

00:02:37.170 --> 00:02:38.670
few short years.

00:02:38.670 --> 00:02:42.780
Stamets of course thinks that fungus is the
answer, that an overuse of antifungal agents

00:02:42.780 --> 00:02:48.010
used to treat crops actually damages the fungus
that colonies need. Early research by Stamets

00:02:48.010 --> 00:02:52.420
and a beekeeper show evidence that fungus
helps bees by attacking the things that make

00:02:52.420 --> 00:02:57.470
them sick. They found that a type of fungus
that usually eats up wood, reduces viruses

00:02:57.470 --> 00:03:01.510
in the bees! And another fungus could kill
the mites directly! So yay!

00:03:01.510 --> 00:03:06.780
But it’s not just bees that fungus helps.
Stamets already found several strains of fungus

00:03:06.780 --> 00:03:11.020
that could turn into life saving medicine.
After all one of the most revolutionary drugs

00:03:11.020 --> 00:03:15.819
of all time, the antibiotic penicillin, came
from a fungus. Stamets found several strains

00:03:15.819 --> 00:03:20.770
of a fungus called agarikon might have resistance
to certain illnesses like TB, smallpox, and

00:03:20.770 --> 00:03:26.150
and the flu according to analyses by the University
of Illinois-Chicago's Institute for Tuberculosis

00:03:26.150 --> 00:03:28.470
Research and the University of Mississippi.

00:03:28.470 --> 00:03:32.590
So the next time you go and hate on fungus,
just remember, it might save your life some

00:03:32.590 --> 00:03:32.920
day.

00:03:32.920 --> 00:03:37.400
So that’s just slice of the story of fungus.
If you’d like to tell your own story you

00:03:37.400 --> 00:03:41.350
should look into getting a domain name for
you’re own webpage. No domain extension

00:03:52.630 --> 00:03:56.150
Alright alright i know, i can’t talk about
fungus and mushrooms without mentioning magic

00:03:56.150 --> 00:04:18.280
mushrooms. Tara’s got the whole story in
