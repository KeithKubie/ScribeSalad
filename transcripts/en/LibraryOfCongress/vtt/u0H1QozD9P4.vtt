&gt;&gt; From the Library of
Congress in Washington, D.C.

00:00:06.290 --> 00:00:07.590
&gt;&gt; Leigh Haber: I'm Leigh Haber.

00:00:07.590 --> 00:00:10.270
I'm Books Editor of
O, The Oprah Magazine.

00:00:10.270 --> 00:00:13.190
And I have the great honor
of being the moderator

00:00:13.190 --> 00:00:19.710
of this incredible pair of authors
who are very, very similar writers.

00:00:19.710 --> 00:00:21.920
That's what we were
just talking about.

00:00:21.920 --> 00:00:28.190
Jacqueline Woodson whose
new book, Another Brooklyn,

00:00:28.190 --> 00:00:31.830
came out recently to rave reviews.

00:00:31.830 --> 00:00:37.360
And Jay McInerney whose new
book Bright, Precious Days,

00:00:37.360 --> 00:00:40.960
is also getting stellar coverage.

00:00:40.960 --> 00:00:45.680
I read an interesting piece in the
New Yorker that you all might want

00:00:45.680 --> 00:00:51.770
to look at, a really good
piece on Jay and his history.

00:00:51.770 --> 00:00:55.460
So what I want to start
talking about is

00:00:55.460 --> 00:00:59.810
like why did the National
Books Festival pair you guys?

00:00:59.810 --> 00:01:03.390
It's like not exactly a no brainer.

00:01:03.390 --> 00:01:05.150
But there is the New York thing.

00:01:05.150 --> 00:01:07.430
&gt;&gt; Jay McInerney: We do
both write about New York.

00:01:07.430 --> 00:01:08.730
&gt;&gt; Leigh: That's right.

00:01:08.730 --> 00:01:12.830 position:56%
So I'm guessing that was the thread.

00:01:13.840 --> 00:01:17.840
So, Jackie, I'm going
to start with you.

00:01:17.840 --> 00:01:19.710
You write about a New
York that's very different

00:01:19.710 --> 00:01:23.240
from the one Jay writes about
in his trilogy and in this book.

00:01:23.240 --> 00:01:29.670
Another Brooklyn, what does the
title Another Brooklyn suggest

00:01:29.670 --> 00:01:30.970
to you?

00:01:30.970 --> 00:01:32.270
&gt;&gt; Jacqueline Woodson: Well,

00:01:32.270 --> 00:01:34.250
one thing it's definitely
from Jay's Manhattan.

00:01:34.250 --> 00:01:36.110
&gt;&gt; Leigh: Or the Brooklyn of today.

00:01:36.110 --> 00:01:39.850
&gt;&gt; Jacqueline: Of the
Brooklyn -- yeah, definitely --

00:01:39.850 --> 00:01:41.150
&gt;&gt; Jay: Or Park Slope.

00:01:41.150 --> 00:01:42.450
&gt;&gt; Jacqueline: Or Park Slope.

00:01:42.450 --> 00:01:43.750
Well, Park Slope is its
own Another Brooklyn.

00:01:43.750 --> 00:01:48.390 position:56%
So I'm writing about a Brooklyn that
no longer exists, a neighborhood

00:01:48.390 --> 00:01:50.800
that no longer exists as
it existed back in the day.

00:01:50.800 --> 00:01:55.350
And that's one of the
threads of the title.

00:01:55.350 --> 00:01:59.230
The other is, of course, the
girls wanting to find a way out of

00:01:59.230 --> 00:02:00.920
that Brooklyn and the
many people trying

00:02:00.920 --> 00:02:02.650
to find a way out of that Brooklyn.

00:02:02.650 --> 00:02:08.060
It's also about all the different
lives that are being lived.

00:02:08.060 --> 00:02:10.170
And so it has a lot of layers.

00:02:10.170 --> 00:02:13.080
But really I wanted to put
Bushwick on the page in a way

00:02:13.080 --> 00:02:15.570
that I think can easily
be forgotten.

00:02:15.570 --> 00:02:19.320
I think a lot of times when
neighborhoods get, quote unquote,

00:02:19.320 --> 00:02:22.680
discovered people forget
the history.

00:02:22.680 --> 00:02:26.400
And that it had been a neighborhood
where people were thriving.

00:02:26.400 --> 00:02:27.990 position:56%
My daughter just started high school

00:02:27.990 --> 00:02:29.670
at a high school called
Beacon in Manhattan.

00:02:29.670 --> 00:02:31.810 position:56%
And she came home and she was so mad

00:02:31.810 --> 00:02:34.220
because she said her
social studies teacher said,

00:02:34.220 --> 00:02:38.920
I lived in Bed-Stuy before
it was safe for anybody.

00:02:38.920 --> 00:02:41.160
I'm like did you respond?

00:02:41.160 --> 00:02:45.490
But just that idea that a
place where people of color are

00:02:45.490 --> 00:02:51.840 position:56%
where underserved people lived would
be considered a place that's not

00:02:51.840 --> 00:02:56.010
inhabited because the people
living in it are not seen.

00:02:56.010 --> 00:02:58.510
&gt;&gt; Leigh: And you are romantic
about Brooklyn in a way,

00:02:58.510 --> 00:02:59.810
the Brooklyn of that day.

00:02:59.810 --> 00:03:01.110
&gt;&gt; Jacqueline: Uh-huh.

00:03:01.110 --> 00:03:02.410
&gt;&gt; Leigh: And that's something
I think you share with Jay.

00:03:02.410 --> 00:03:05.190
Jay is very romantic
about Manhattan,

00:03:05.190 --> 00:03:08.710
the Manhattan of the 80s,
the Manhattan of today.

00:03:08.710 --> 00:03:11.270
So would you agree
with that assessment?

00:03:11.270 --> 00:03:16.500
&gt;&gt; Jay: Well, yeah, I
still love Manhattan.

00:03:16.500 --> 00:03:25.030
But I think I have a -- in the
book the characters have a certain

00:03:25.030 --> 00:03:30.480
nostalgia for the New York of their
20s which is the 80s basically.

00:03:30.480 --> 00:03:34.440
And my wife gives me a very
hard time for being nostalgic

00:03:34.440 --> 00:03:37.580
about a period when, you know,

00:03:37.580 --> 00:03:40.620
when one's apartment was
constantly broken into

00:03:40.620 --> 00:03:43.990
and there was a heroin epidemic,
when there was crack vials popping

00:03:43.990 --> 00:03:50.130 position:56%
under foot like acorns in the forest
and graffiti covered every surface.

00:03:50.130 --> 00:03:55.530
But, you know, it was a very
creative time in New York.

00:03:55.530 --> 00:04:01.190
And also Manhattan hadn't
been thoroughly gentrified

00:04:01.190 --> 00:04:03.520
at that point which I think --

00:04:03.520 --> 00:04:05.140
&gt;&gt; Leigh: Yeah, it's hard to
remember that, but you're right.

00:04:05.140 --> 00:04:09.720
&gt;&gt; Jay: Yeah, which was
in some ways a good thing.

00:04:09.720 --> 00:04:12.060
&gt;&gt; Leigh: Well, I asked
Jackie about her title.

00:04:12.060 --> 00:04:18.370
And I'm interested in your love
for the word bright, Bright Lights,

00:04:18.370 --> 00:04:23.440
Big City, the previous novel
that starts the trilogy

00:04:23.440 --> 00:04:24.740
and now this one [inaudible].

00:04:24.740 --> 00:04:30.310
&gt;&gt; Leigh: I know it's become
a tick on my part I think.

00:04:30.310 --> 00:04:35.400
It's funny I came up with this
title, and for me it was kind

00:04:35.400 --> 00:04:39.930
of a mash up of me and Yeats.

00:04:39.930 --> 00:04:43.550
For some reason I actually
thought that Yeats had this phrase

00:04:43.550 --> 00:04:47.200
in his poetry, and it
turns out he doesn't.

00:04:47.200 --> 00:04:52.060
But by the time I realized that
I was kind of fond of the title.

00:04:52.060 --> 00:04:55.450
And the title in this case,
in the case of this book,

00:04:55.450 --> 00:04:59.900
really refers to basically,
you know,

00:04:59.900 --> 00:05:03.360
the days that you don't
notice going by

00:05:03.360 --> 00:05:07.580
and in retrospect are really
the most important ones,

00:05:07.580 --> 00:05:11.110
the ones that make up
the bulk of our lives.

00:05:11.110 --> 00:05:13.550
I don't know, I just think
in terms of bright --

00:05:13.550 --> 00:05:19.190
I think my characters are attracted
to New York like moths to flame.

00:05:19.190 --> 00:05:22.410
I think that's part of it.

00:05:22.410 --> 00:05:26.550
I like the word in so far

00:05:26.550 --> 00:05:31.280
as it denotes intelligence
and illumination.

00:05:31.280 --> 00:05:34.210
I don't know.

00:05:34.210 --> 00:05:38.830
I'm going to try and stay away
from it for the next few titles.

00:05:38.830 --> 00:05:41.940
&gt;&gt; Leigh: Well, the other thing,
so as I was talking about - -

00:05:41.940 --> 00:05:45.350
after I was invited to moderate
this panel I started thinking

00:05:45.350 --> 00:05:47.300
about how dissimilar
these two writers are

00:05:47.300 --> 00:05:51.030
in so many ways and their books.

00:05:51.030 --> 00:05:54.970
So, Jackie, your book
is really about youth.

00:05:54.970 --> 00:06:00.930
It's about people, girls who
it's before they have become

00:06:00.930 --> 00:06:02.530
who they're going to become.

00:06:02.530 --> 00:06:03.830
Wouldn't you say that?

00:06:03.830 --> 00:06:05.130
&gt;&gt; Jacqueline: Uh-huh.

00:06:05.130 --> 00:06:09.060
&gt;&gt; Leigh: And you do write a lot
for adolescents, about adolescence.

00:06:09.060 --> 00:06:12.210
So can you tell us a little
bit about why you're drawn

00:06:12.210 --> 00:06:15.090
to that period in a person's life?

00:06:15.090 --> 00:06:18.610
&gt;&gt; Jacqueline: Yeah, I think
people tend to say you write

00:06:18.610 --> 00:06:20.530
in the period you're stuck in.

00:06:20.530 --> 00:06:22.380
So you write in the
age you're stuck in.

00:06:22.380 --> 00:06:25.330
And I think for me it's
somewhere between 10 and 16.

00:06:25.330 --> 00:06:30.950
And joining on that that's
another thing that Jay

00:06:30.950 --> 00:06:34.690
and I echo is the memory, the
looking back with this kind

00:06:34.690 --> 00:06:37.860
of melancholy and nostalgia
at the period.

00:06:37.860 --> 00:06:42.390
And so in the case of Another
Brooklyn August is looking back

00:06:42.390 --> 00:06:45.800
on that girlhood with that same
kind -- she says, you know,

00:06:45.800 --> 00:06:50.800
I know now what's tragic isn't
the moment, it's the memory.

00:06:50.800 --> 00:06:54.120
So looking back on it and
realizing that while you're

00:06:54.120 --> 00:06:59.370
in it you're not aware exactly of
how quickly that time has passed,

00:06:59.370 --> 00:07:02.020
right, and that one
day it will be past.

00:07:02.020 --> 00:07:06.310
So I think one thing,
that's the thing for grown

00:07:06.310 --> 00:07:08.110
up and adolescence, right?

00:07:08.110 --> 00:07:11.530
We look back and it's like, wait,
I'm no longer that young person.

00:07:11.530 --> 00:07:15.680
I'm no longer that girl
and so who am I now?

00:07:15.680 --> 00:07:17.880
&gt;&gt; Leigh: And it's funny
that you cited that line

00:07:17.880 --> 00:07:19.920
because right here I have what
is tragic isn't the moment it's

00:07:19.920 --> 00:07:22.260
the memory.

00:07:22.260 --> 00:07:25.220
And then I found something
you said somewhere,

00:07:25.220 --> 00:07:27.770
a writer writes to hold on.

00:07:27.770 --> 00:07:31.080
And I think you're right,
both of your books are --

00:07:31.080 --> 00:07:36.000
you're still inhabiting youth
in some ways or, you know,

00:07:36.000 --> 00:07:40.090
aching for it or aching
for a time or, you know,

00:07:40.090 --> 00:07:42.800
looking back with a
kind of world weariness.

00:07:42.800 --> 00:07:47.120
Jay, I think Adelle Waldman
in the New Yorker piece

00:07:47.120 --> 00:07:50.390
that I cited before was
talking about malaise,

00:07:50.390 --> 00:07:53.830
the middle age malaise with
which your characters are --

00:07:53.830 --> 00:07:57.830
&gt;&gt; Jay: You know in an
otherwise very good essay

00:07:57.830 --> 00:08:00.960
in a favorable [inaudible]
I think she emphasized

00:08:00.960 --> 00:08:04.370
that malaise a little bit too much.

00:08:04.370 --> 00:08:08.070
Russell Calloway, one of the
main characters in the book,

00:08:08.070 --> 00:08:11.960
does go through a depression
basically.

00:08:11.960 --> 00:08:15.220
I think it's largely
situational based on the fact

00:08:15.220 --> 00:08:17.650
that he's made a really
stupid decision.

00:08:17.650 --> 00:08:19.000
&gt;&gt; Leigh: A business decision.

00:08:19.000 --> 00:08:21.680
&gt;&gt; Jay: In his publishing
business which possibly is going

00:08:21.680 --> 00:08:23.810
to bring his publishing house down.

00:08:23.810 --> 00:08:28.630
I mean I was a little - - I don't
know, I mean I don't think really

00:08:28.630 --> 00:08:31.090
that this is a book about middle
age malaise in the sense that most

00:08:31.090 --> 00:08:33.760
of these characters
are pretty animated.

00:08:33.760 --> 00:08:35.060
Like most New Yorkers --

00:08:35.060 --> 00:08:36.370
&gt;&gt; Leigh: Right, well middle
age malaise is a cliche.

00:08:36.370 --> 00:08:37.670
&gt;&gt; Jay: It is a cliche.

00:08:37.670 --> 00:08:39.740
But most of these characters
are pretty obsessed

00:08:39.740 --> 00:08:41.460
with like what's next --

00:08:41.460 --> 00:08:42.760
&gt;&gt; Leigh: Right.

00:08:42.760 --> 00:08:45.480
&gt;&gt; Jay: -- in their life as
parents, as the professionals.

00:08:45.480 --> 00:08:47.540
So I --

00:08:47.540 --> 00:08:51.650
&gt;&gt; Leigh: And also trying to
hold onto a marriage that is --

00:08:51.650 --> 00:08:52.950 position:56%
&gt;&gt; Jay: Yeah, and in their marriage.

00:08:52.950 --> 00:08:54.340
&gt;&gt; Leigh: -- stable and
steady in some ways though

00:08:54.340 --> 00:08:58.050
with people sometimes going
in different directions.

00:08:58.050 --> 00:09:01.110
But people still trying
to be engaged

00:09:01.110 --> 00:09:04.180 position:56%
with each other in the world, right?

00:09:04.180 --> 00:09:06.840
&gt;&gt; Jay: Marriage is tough.

00:09:06.840 --> 00:09:08.890
That's one of the main subjects.

00:09:08.890 --> 00:09:10.570
&gt;&gt; Leigh: And you begin the book

00:09:10.570 --> 00:09:14.670 position:56%
with the Richard Held [phonetic]
quote about marriage that's so good.

00:09:14.670 --> 00:09:18.790
Let's see if I can find it
somewhere, about mystery.

00:09:18.790 --> 00:09:21.870
Oh, here, every marriage
is its own culture and even

00:09:21.870 --> 00:09:23.850
within it mystery is
the environment.

00:09:23.850 --> 00:09:27.250
And I think you capture
that so beautifully

00:09:27.250 --> 00:09:29.580
about Corrine and Russell's
marriage.

00:09:29.580 --> 00:09:37.020
&gt;&gt; Jay: Interesting quote from the
sort of founder of New York punk.

00:09:37.020 --> 00:09:45.650
But that sort of captures two
of the poles in this book.

00:09:45.650 --> 00:09:50.080
I mean it does look back to the
days of these characters' youth

00:09:50.080 --> 00:09:53.350
when there punk music
was being invented

00:09:53.350 --> 00:09:55.290
at CBGBs on the lower east side.

00:09:55.290 --> 00:10:00.540
But it's also about people who
are now turning 50 and dealing

00:10:00.540 --> 00:10:07.100
with middle aged problems and
crises and marital dilemmas.

00:10:07.100 --> 00:10:08.930
&gt;&gt; Leigh: Well, since
you mentioned music,

00:10:08.930 --> 00:10:11.510
there's a lot of music
in your book, Jackie.

00:10:11.510 --> 00:10:15.090
And in some ways it's kind
of an ode to jazz, right?

00:10:15.090 --> 00:10:16.390
&gt;&gt; Jacqueline: Uh-huh.

00:10:16.390 --> 00:10:18.230
&gt;&gt; Leigh: Even the way
the book is structured.

00:10:18.230 --> 00:10:19.530
&gt;&gt; Jacqueline: Yeah.

00:10:19.530 --> 00:10:20.830
&gt;&gt; Leigh: Its riffs.

00:10:20.830 --> 00:10:22.130
&gt;&gt; Jacqueline: Uh-huh.

00:10:22.130 --> 00:10:25.410
Yeah, it's an ode to jazz and
kind of a thumb to 70s music.

00:10:25.410 --> 00:10:28.900 position:56%
While at the same time it's
celebrating it because I bring a lot

00:10:28.900 --> 00:10:30.500
of that music back
into the narrative.

00:10:30.500 --> 00:10:32.540
&gt;&gt; Jay: A lot of great 70s music.

00:10:32.540 --> 00:10:33.840
&gt;&gt; Jacqueline: Rock the Boat.

00:10:33.840 --> 00:10:35.140
&gt;&gt; Leigh: I know, Rock the Boat,

00:10:35.140 --> 00:10:37.770
that kept going through
my head today.

00:10:37.770 --> 00:10:40.840
Do you want to give us a rendition?

00:10:40.840 --> 00:10:44.570
&gt;&gt; Jacqueline: You so don't
want me to give you a rendition.

00:10:44.570 --> 00:10:51.890
But Nina Simone's Tom Thumb's
Blues which is a beautiful song,

00:10:51.890 --> 00:10:54.450
but the girls couldn't
understand what it was saying.

00:10:54.450 --> 00:10:55.750
And I think that is, I think

00:10:55.750 --> 00:10:58.690
about adolescence we think
the music is speaking to us,

00:10:58.690 --> 00:11:01.710
and we think we understand
what it's saying.

00:11:01.710 --> 00:11:05.660
And then we realize later
on that maybe not so much.

00:11:05.660 --> 00:11:12.060 position:56%
I just loved being able to put on
my headphones and revisit that music

00:11:12.060 --> 00:11:17.710
and just remember it and remember
how important it was to me

00:11:17.710 --> 00:11:21.250
as an adolescent, and then look
at it from an adult perspective

00:11:21.250 --> 00:11:26.790
and realize not a whole lot was
being said in a lot of those songs.

00:11:26.790 --> 00:11:28.920
&gt;&gt; Leigh: Well, you know,
there's that one moment

00:11:28.920 --> 00:11:32.660
where August see's Jerome
[assumed spelling], her love,

00:11:32.660 --> 00:11:37.560
her teenage love with
one of her best friends.

00:11:37.560 --> 00:11:38.860
&gt;&gt; Jacqueline: With Sylvia, uh-huh.

00:11:38.860 --> 00:11:41.710
&gt;&gt; Leigh: And I'm not quoting,
you may remember the exact line,

00:11:41.710 --> 00:11:43.720
but the world just falls apart

00:11:43.720 --> 00:11:47.870
as only 15 year old worlds can
fall apart that way, right?

00:11:47.870 --> 00:11:49.170
&gt;&gt; Jacqueline: Yeah.

00:11:49.170 --> 00:11:50.480
I don't remember the line.

00:11:50.480 --> 00:11:53.300
But, yeah, it shatters it for her.

00:11:53.300 --> 00:11:57.280
I mean for her it's the moment
of coming into adulthood.

00:11:57.280 --> 00:11:59.430
And when I was writing
it one thing I was trying

00:11:59.430 --> 00:12:06.280
to investigate is how women grow
up to not have women friends.

00:12:06.280 --> 00:12:11.330
And I think that for me
as a mom, as a partner,

00:12:11.330 --> 00:12:15.170
my village is what grounds
me, the women in my life.

00:12:15.170 --> 00:12:19.660 position:56%
And the men are the people who help
me raise my children, who ground me,

00:12:19.660 --> 00:12:21.330
who help me get my
books into the world.

00:12:21.330 --> 00:12:25.210
And all these ways in
which I need those women.

00:12:25.210 --> 00:12:27.630
And I meet women who say, you know,

00:12:27.630 --> 00:12:30.960
I can't have women
friends, I don't trust them.

00:12:30.960 --> 00:12:33.030
&gt;&gt; Leigh: Well, in August's
case, your main character --

00:12:33.030 --> 00:12:34.330
&gt;&gt; Jay: The mother in
the book doesn't --

00:12:34.330 --> 00:12:35.630
&gt;&gt; Leigh: That's what
I was going to say.

00:12:35.630 --> 00:12:36.930
&gt;&gt; Jacqueline: Say it again.

00:12:36.930 --> 00:12:38.230
&gt;&gt; Jay: The mother in your book
doesn't believe in female friends.

00:12:38.230 --> 00:12:39.530
&gt;&gt; Jacqueline: That
was me trying to --

00:12:39.530 --> 00:12:40.830
&gt;&gt; Leigh: She says
don't trust women,

00:12:40.830 --> 00:12:43.010
even the ugly ones will take
what you thought was yours.

00:12:43.010 --> 00:12:44.310
[Laughter]

00:12:44.310 --> 00:12:45.610
&gt;&gt; Jacqueline: Was yours, yeah.

00:12:45.610 --> 00:12:51.490
But it is that thing of how do you
get from this very intimate place

00:12:51.490 --> 00:12:55.970
of girlhood friendships to
having no female friends?

00:12:55.970 --> 00:12:59.020
And I wanted to investigate it
because I didn't understand it.

00:12:59.020 --> 00:13:01.300
And I always say I write because
I have all these questions,

00:13:01.300 --> 00:13:02.600
not answers.

00:13:02.600 --> 00:13:06.480
And what breaks us, what causes
us to move away from each other

00:13:06.480 --> 00:13:12.520
in this way that could be very
detrimental to our own humanity?

00:13:12.520 --> 00:13:15.450
So, I don't know, it's
a big question for me.

00:13:15.450 --> 00:13:17.270
Every time I meet a
women who is like, no,

00:13:17.270 --> 00:13:19.940
I don't have female
friends I'm just like, wow,

00:13:19.940 --> 00:13:21.730
that's heartbreaking to me.

00:13:21.730 --> 00:13:23.400
&gt;&gt; Leigh: And I think
it is the way August

00:13:23.400 --> 00:13:25.320
and her circle start together.

00:13:25.320 --> 00:13:26.940
August sees these three girls,

00:13:26.940 --> 00:13:31.890
and she just for some inexplicable
reason she's just drawn to them.

00:13:31.890 --> 00:13:33.190
&gt;&gt; Jacqueline: Mm-hmm.

00:13:33.190 --> 00:13:34.490
&gt;&gt; Leigh: And, you know, Jay,

00:13:34.490 --> 00:13:35.790
similarly I mean I
think I was thinking

00:13:35.790 --> 00:13:37.780
about similarities
between your books.

00:13:37.780 --> 00:13:43.120
It's obvious to me anyway that male
friendships have been so important

00:13:43.120 --> 00:13:46.730
to you in your writings
life, in your career.

00:13:46.730 --> 00:13:51.410
I don't know whether Russell
is drawn directly from someone

00:13:51.410 --> 00:13:56.340
like Morgan Entrekin, but you have
a very close circle it seems to me

00:13:56.340 --> 00:14:03.420
of male friend who perhaps enable
you to really do a good job

00:14:03.420 --> 00:14:07.280
of capturing that sense of bonding.

00:14:07.280 --> 00:14:15.410
&gt;&gt; Jay: Well, I should mention that
Russell Calloway, the protagonist

00:14:15.410 --> 00:14:21.100
of this novel, is an editor,
and actually when we meet him

00:14:21.100 --> 00:14:25.410
in this book he's also
the publisher of a small,

00:14:25.410 --> 00:14:28.900
independent literary
publishing house.

00:14:28.900 --> 00:14:32.130
And I actually have a couple
of close friends in my life

00:14:32.130 --> 00:14:36.520
who are editors and
publishers and I have had

00:14:36.520 --> 00:14:40.330
for I guess more than 30 years now.

00:14:40.330 --> 00:14:46.990
And inevitably I do draw
on these people in my life

00:14:46.990 --> 00:14:49.540
when I'm shaping my characters.

00:14:49.540 --> 00:14:54.620
Although I have to say that
this is actually a third book

00:14:54.620 --> 00:14:57.310
in what is now obviously a trilogy.

00:14:57.310 --> 00:15:01.970
And at this point I can't
really remember what I took

00:15:01.970 --> 00:15:04.890
from whom including myself.

00:15:04.890 --> 00:15:07.670
Russell Calloway to
me seems like sort

00:15:07.670 --> 00:15:13.450
of a real character
out there in the world.

00:15:13.450 --> 00:15:20.220
And I'm sure I owe parts of
him to my various friends.

00:15:20.220 --> 00:15:23.580
&gt;&gt; Leigh: And there's I think
one of the things about the two

00:15:23.580 --> 00:15:29.690
of you together, New York I
think we feel as if it is a kind

00:15:29.690 --> 00:15:32.020
of community, a literary
community in some ways.

00:15:32.020 --> 00:15:36.570
So there is that insularity
or that community of writers.

00:15:36.570 --> 00:15:42.870 position:56%
But then we're writing about two
very different kinds of communities.

00:15:42.870 --> 00:15:47.220
I just want to switch a
little bit to influences.

00:15:47.220 --> 00:15:50.360
And, Jackie, I'll start
with you because I know

00:15:50.360 --> 00:15:54.440
that for you James
Baldwin was an influence.

00:15:54.440 --> 00:15:57.360
Virginia Hamilton was
very much of an influence,

00:15:57.360 --> 00:16:00.110
another wonderful young
adult writer.

00:16:00.110 --> 00:16:03.210
And Nikki Giovanni.

00:16:03.210 --> 00:16:06.840 position:56%
So can you tell us a little bit
about the influence of those writers

00:16:06.840 --> 00:16:13.180
on your work and how
that feeds what you do?

00:16:13.180 --> 00:16:16.570
&gt;&gt; Jacqueline: I think
one of the biggest parts

00:16:16.570 --> 00:16:19.380
of the influence was that,
of course, they were writing

00:16:19.380 --> 00:16:21.730
about people I really cared about

00:16:21.730 --> 00:16:25.030
and could see reflections
of myself inside of.

00:16:25.030 --> 00:16:29.900
And they were also -- I think
the thing that I was figuring

00:16:29.900 --> 00:16:33.900
out was the context of
myself in the bigger world.

00:16:33.900 --> 00:16:38.400
And I knew that the writer
couldn't just be navel gazing.

00:16:38.400 --> 00:16:42.510
That I had to look at myself
as being here now or look

00:16:42.510 --> 00:16:44.060
at my characters as being here now

00:16:44.060 --> 00:16:47.730
and the impact they were having
the world and the world was having

00:16:47.730 --> 00:16:49.030
on them when you look at something

00:16:49.030 --> 00:16:53.750
like James Baldwin's
Another Country.

00:16:53.750 --> 00:16:58.620 position:56%
It's a huge book that really gets us
into the head of talking about race,

00:16:58.620 --> 00:17:01.490
of talking about economic class,
of talking about sexuality

00:17:01.490 --> 00:17:04.670
and all these things that would
eventually be very important to me.

00:17:04.670 --> 00:17:09.000
Nikki Giovanni the same
thing listening to her

00:17:09.000 --> 00:17:13.260
because I heard her before I read
her during the whole Black Power

00:17:13.260 --> 00:17:15.850 position:56%
Movement was really important to me.

00:17:15.850 --> 00:17:20.020
Not only in figuring out who I was
becoming but in giving me license

00:17:20.020 --> 00:17:23.920
to write about what I cared
about writing on the page.

00:17:23.920 --> 00:17:27.970
And the same with eventually even
Raymond Carver in terms of looking

00:17:27.970 --> 00:17:29.270
at a writer that was minimalist.

00:17:29.270 --> 00:17:32.070
&gt;&gt; Leigh: Something
you guys really share.

00:17:32.070 --> 00:17:33.370
&gt;&gt; Jacqueline: But
also he was writing

00:17:33.370 --> 00:17:37.310
about underserved white folks
which was my first meeting people

00:17:37.310 --> 00:17:39.680
who were struggling that way.

00:17:39.680 --> 00:17:45.340
So I think those writers
definitely gave me license to kind

00:17:45.340 --> 00:17:47.230
of tell the stories I
would eventually tell.

00:17:47.230 --> 00:17:50.480
&gt;&gt; Leigh: Jay, your character
Russell loved Raymond Carver.

00:17:50.480 --> 00:17:52.840
Did you share that love?

00:17:52.840 --> 00:17:58.460
&gt;&gt; Jay: Well, Raymond Carver was my
teacher and in some ways my mentor.

00:17:58.460 --> 00:18:01.930
&gt;&gt; Jacqueline: Where
was he your teacher?

00:18:01.930 --> 00:18:05.810
&gt;&gt; Jay: I studied great writing
in Syracuse in the early 80s,

00:18:05.810 --> 00:18:08.400
and I was very lucky
to have not only Carver

00:18:08.400 --> 00:18:11.650
but Tobias Wolff as
my teachers, too.

00:18:11.650 --> 00:18:12.950
Very different teachers.

00:18:12.950 --> 00:18:16.760
&gt;&gt; Leigh: Anybody who hasn't read
Raymond Carver's short stories he's

00:18:16.760 --> 00:18:18.550
one of the best.

00:18:18.550 --> 00:18:20.790
&gt;&gt; Jay: When I was thinking
about going to graduate school

00:18:20.790 --> 00:18:26.400 position:56%
in the early 80s Carver was probably
the most imitated, the most admired

00:18:26.400 --> 00:18:28.930
and imitated short story
writer in the country.

00:18:28.930 --> 00:18:33.710
And we were all trying to
write stories like Carver.

00:18:33.710 --> 00:18:36.230
And we were trying
to imitate his titles

00:18:36.230 --> 00:18:41.250
like what do you think of this?

00:18:41.250 --> 00:18:47.290
And for someone like me who did
not grow up in a trailer park

00:18:47.290 --> 00:18:51.270
in the western states it was
kind of ridiculous the fact

00:18:51.270 --> 00:18:53.760
that I was trying to write
about characters like this.

00:18:53.760 --> 00:18:55.770
&gt;&gt; Leigh: You group
up in Hartford, right?

00:18:55.770 --> 00:18:57.920
&gt;&gt; Jay: No, no, I grew
up all over the country.

00:18:57.920 --> 00:19:00.450 position:56%
But it was always suburb or another.

00:19:00.450 --> 00:19:04.630
So it was pretty inauthentic
trying to imitate Carver.

00:19:04.630 --> 00:19:07.210
And yet I think that that's
one of the ways that writers --

00:19:07.210 --> 00:19:09.090
you were talking about influence,
I think that's one of the ways

00:19:09.090 --> 00:19:15.020
that writers find their own
voices is to borrow Carver's,

00:19:15.020 --> 00:19:19.670
one of this titles, Putting
Yourself in Someone Else's Shoes.

00:19:19.670 --> 00:19:26.300
And in my case imitating
Carver, imitating Hemingway,

00:19:26.300 --> 00:19:28.230
imitating DeLillo,
imitating Ann [inaudible].

00:19:28.230 --> 00:19:34.440
And eventually outgrowing
those imitations.

00:19:34.440 --> 00:19:38.420
But it's like trying on your
parents clothes and shoes.

00:19:38.420 --> 00:19:47.710
Carver was extremely influential
in many ways to me, although I gave

00:19:47.710 --> 00:19:50.130
up trying to imitate his
subject matter and his titles.

00:19:50.130 --> 00:19:53.200
And he taught me an
awful lot about economy

00:19:53.200 --> 00:19:54.830
and concision and storytelling.

00:19:54.830 --> 00:19:58.920
One of my favorite incidents
with him was he used to go

00:19:58.920 --> 00:20:02.070
over my short stories in
the office after class.

00:20:02.070 --> 00:20:04.520
And at one point he said to me,

00:20:04.520 --> 00:20:07.320
he said why do you use
the word dirt here?

00:20:07.320 --> 00:20:12.840
Or why do you use the word earth
here, what you really mean is dirt.

00:20:12.840 --> 00:20:18.490
You're trying to a kind of
grandiosity that you don't need.

00:20:18.490 --> 00:20:20.760
&gt;&gt; Leigh: That's so interesting.

00:20:20.760 --> 00:20:23.080
&gt;&gt; Jay: That that was always --

00:20:23.080 --> 00:20:26.060
he sort of made me
really think very hard

00:20:26.060 --> 00:20:30.230
about my word choices
and what they meant.

00:20:30.230 --> 00:20:33.940
And I think for a long time I felt
him sort of standing on my shoulder

00:20:33.940 --> 00:20:35.610
when I sat down to write.

00:20:35.610 --> 00:20:37.810
&gt;&gt; Leigh: And yet you
became a novelist.

00:20:37.810 --> 00:20:40.430
&gt;&gt; Jay: You know, I did.

00:20:40.430 --> 00:20:47.250
And in fact, I always -- I don't
know, my first love was poetry.

00:20:47.250 --> 00:20:50.840 position:56%
And then I read Portrait of the
Artist as a young man and I thought,

00:20:50.840 --> 00:20:54.200
wow, prose can be very
lyrical and musical as well.

00:20:54.200 --> 00:20:57.950
And about the same time I read
Hemingway's the Sun Also Rises.

00:20:57.950 --> 00:21:03.670
So I wanted to be a novelist.

00:21:03.670 --> 00:21:06.640
And yet it's hard to just
sit down and write a novel.

00:21:06.640 --> 00:21:11.350
I think for me as for
many apprentice writers --

00:21:11.350 --> 00:21:13.620
&gt;&gt; Leigh: What do you
mean, it's easy, right?

00:21:13.620 --> 00:21:15.540
&gt;&gt; Jay: For most fiction
writers I think we start

00:21:15.540 --> 00:21:16.840
out with short stories.

00:21:16.840 --> 00:21:22.580
And some people stay with them
and some people choose novels.

00:21:22.580 --> 00:21:25.200
There's a very few
people who do both well.

00:21:25.200 --> 00:21:26.500
Not too many.

00:21:26.500 --> 00:21:28.490
John Updike I think did.

00:21:28.490 --> 00:21:33.940
But Carver wanted to write
a novel and never succeeded.

00:21:33.940 --> 00:21:35.990
And yet who would have --

00:21:35.990 --> 00:21:40.780
I don't think it in any way
lessens his achievement.

00:21:40.780 --> 00:21:45.310 position:56%
&gt;&gt; Leigh: So, Jackie, you're known
primarily as a young adult novelist.

00:21:45.310 --> 00:21:50.740
That's where you made most
of your mark up until now.

00:21:50.740 --> 00:21:58.360
So does one sit down and say I'm
going to write a young adult novel?

00:21:58.360 --> 00:22:06.990
And then how is Another Brooklyn
different from a young adult novel?

00:22:06.990 --> 00:22:09.510
&gt;&gt; Jacqueline: Yeah,
I definitely I think

00:22:09.510 --> 00:22:14.190
after Brown Girl Dreaming got the
National Book Award I was kind

00:22:14.190 --> 00:22:16.380
of like I want to try
something else now.

00:22:16.380 --> 00:22:20.260
I don't want to paint a
story night again, right?

00:22:20.260 --> 00:22:25.790
I want to really sit down
and just kind of refocus

00:22:25.790 --> 00:22:27.790
for a little while just to do it.

00:22:27.790 --> 00:22:31.020
And I knew I wanted
to play with time more

00:22:31.020 --> 00:22:33.820
which is something you can do
when you're writing for adults.

00:22:33.820 --> 00:22:36.490 position:56%
When you're writing for young people
you stay within a certain space

00:22:36.490 --> 00:22:39.990
and time, so maybe a year, maybe
a weekend, maybe a school year.

00:22:39.990 --> 00:22:42.920
And there's not that
adult perspective.

00:22:42.920 --> 00:22:45.870
So when I'm writing a novel

00:22:45.870 --> 00:22:49.770
where the adult is the main
character I can look back in time,

00:22:49.770 --> 00:22:51.920
have them look back on their
adolescence, then come back

00:22:51.920 --> 00:22:54.070
into their adult perspective.

00:22:54.070 --> 00:22:55.390
And I wanted to do that.

00:22:55.390 --> 00:22:56.940
I wanted the writing
to be more implicit.

00:22:56.940 --> 00:22:59.590
And my young adult writing
can be very implicit.

00:22:59.590 --> 00:23:07.490
But I just wanted to go a little
bit deeper into that adult's gaze.

00:23:07.490 --> 00:23:11.680
In terms of the depth of the
narrative I think there are

00:23:11.680 --> 00:23:14.490
so many young adult novels
that really go to a lot

00:23:14.490 --> 00:23:18.490
of really important
and implicit places.

00:23:18.490 --> 00:23:20.530
But I wanted to do
it just differently.

00:23:20.530 --> 00:23:25.390
And I wanted to, you know,
throw some sex in there.

00:23:25.390 --> 00:23:29.590
I don't really put a whole lot
of sex in young adult novels.

00:23:29.590 --> 00:23:32.940
Not like they're not having it,
not like it's not happening.

00:23:32.940 --> 00:23:37.490
But it happens off the
page more in my book.

00:23:37.490 --> 00:23:41.470
That's my own religious upbringing.

00:23:41.470 --> 00:23:44.920
But I definitely wanted
to challenge myself.

00:23:44.920 --> 00:23:48.950
And it's a case for when I wrote
Brown Girl Dreaming I wanted to see

00:23:48.950 --> 00:23:51.570
if I could write a memoir in verse.

00:23:51.570 --> 00:23:57.080
When I wrote If You Come Softly I
wanted to rewrite Romeo and Juliet

00:23:57.080 --> 00:24:01.390
but tell it from an
interracial perspective.

00:24:01.390 --> 00:24:05.190
So I always try to do something
differently when I write.

00:24:05.190 --> 00:24:10.270 position:56%
And this was where I felt like after
Brown Girl Dreaming was the right

00:24:10.270 --> 00:24:11.570
place to go.

00:24:11.570 --> 00:24:13.960
&gt;&gt; Leigh: Well, since we're talking
a little bit about process, Jay,

00:24:13.960 --> 00:24:18.460
I was wondering -- this is the
third in the trilogy for you.

00:24:18.460 --> 00:24:23.270
What was your -- and when you
began the trilogy did you say

00:24:23.270 --> 00:24:25.850
to yourself I'm going
to write a trilogy?

00:24:25.850 --> 00:24:27.190
&gt;&gt; Jay: No.

00:24:27.190 --> 00:24:32.190
I definitely had no notion
that I was writing a trilogy.

00:24:32.190 --> 00:24:35.430
This series started with a
book called Brightness Falls --

00:24:35.430 --> 00:24:36.730
&gt;&gt; Leigh: Wonderful
book if you have not --

00:24:36.730 --> 00:24:38.580
&gt;&gt; Jay: Published in 92.

00:24:38.580 --> 00:24:44.950
And that book started out I had
written two very tightly focused

00:24:44.950 --> 00:24:50.800
sort of Manhattan novels that
were very narrow in terms

00:24:50.800 --> 00:24:53.400
of time frame and point of view.

00:24:53.400 --> 00:24:54.700
And I was --

00:24:54.700 --> 00:24:56.000
&gt;&gt; Leigh: And also page count.

00:24:56.000 --> 00:24:57.300
&gt;&gt; Jay: Yeah, and page count.

00:24:57.300 --> 00:25:00.410
I was reading Zachary and Balzac,
and I wanted to write a bigger,

00:25:00.410 --> 00:25:03.050
more panoramic kind
of New York novel.

00:25:03.050 --> 00:25:05.400
And I was standing on
Fifth Avenue one day.

00:25:05.400 --> 00:25:07.000
And there was right
across the street

00:25:07.000 --> 00:25:09.940
from me a homeless man
with a bag of cans.

00:25:09.940 --> 00:25:15.810
And Ronald Perelman, the corporate
raider billionaire, and I only knew

00:25:15.810 --> 00:25:20.270
who he was because he'd been on the
cover of some magazine recently.

00:25:20.270 --> 00:25:23.680
And I suddenly thought, hey, I
want to write a novel that has both

00:25:23.680 --> 00:25:25.960
of those characters in it.

00:25:25.960 --> 00:25:31.630
But the whole sort of scope
of New York, in other words.

00:25:31.630 --> 00:25:35.380
Eventually I realized I needed
somebody, something in the middle,

00:25:35.380 --> 00:25:39.390
and I came up with this couple,
Russell and Corrine Calloway

00:25:39.390 --> 00:25:42.550 position:56%
who was sort of one of those couples
everybody kind of looks up to.

00:25:42.550 --> 00:25:44.760
They go married early,
they give cocktail parties.

00:25:44.760 --> 00:25:46.060
&gt;&gt; Leigh: They meet in college.

00:25:46.060 --> 00:25:50.820
&gt;&gt; Jay: Yeah, they're kind of cool.

00:25:50.820 --> 00:25:54.490
And the first novel was
set in the late 80s.

00:25:54.490 --> 00:26:01.980
And I certainly didn't think of
it as being part of a series.

00:26:01.980 --> 00:26:05.370
If I had I wouldn't have killed
off one of the main characters.

00:26:05.370 --> 00:26:07.300
&gt;&gt; Leigh: Right, part
of the love triangle.

00:26:07.300 --> 00:26:09.410
&gt;&gt; Jay: There's a sort of
Jay McInerney character,

00:26:09.410 --> 00:26:14.410 position:56%
a successful writer names Jeff
Pierce who is Russell's best friend.

00:26:14.410 --> 00:26:15.710 position:56%
&gt;&gt; Leigh: And Russell is his editor.

00:26:15.710 --> 00:26:18.850
&gt;&gt; Jay: And Russell is his editor.

00:26:18.850 --> 00:26:22.300
And he actually comes to AIDS.

00:26:22.300 --> 00:26:29.680
And I think that if I had realized
I was writing a series I might not

00:26:29.680 --> 00:26:30.980
have done that.

00:26:30.980 --> 00:26:34.330
It was kind of me trying to
kill off the bad part of myself,

00:26:34.330 --> 00:26:37.990
this sort of bad boy
80s writer character.

00:26:37.990 --> 00:26:44.590
So when September 11th
befell New York,

00:26:44.590 --> 00:26:48.790
when the World Trade
Towers collapsed,

00:26:48.790 --> 00:26:53.080
like many fiction writers I think
I at first couldn't imagine how

00:26:53.080 --> 00:26:56.260
to address this catastrophe.

00:26:56.260 --> 00:27:01.220
And eventually I decided to kind of
bring it down to a domestic scale

00:27:01.220 --> 00:27:03.440
and see how Russell
and Corrine Calloway

00:27:03.440 --> 00:27:06.190
and their friends would
react to this event.

00:27:06.190 --> 00:27:09.090
And suddenly I went back to them.

00:27:09.090 --> 00:27:15.120
&gt;&gt; Leigh: Now that we're seeing a
trilogy does that mean you're done

00:27:15.120 --> 00:27:21.380
with those characters, or
will we have a quartet?

00:27:21.380 --> 00:27:24.470 position:56%
&gt;&gt; Jay: Well, it's funny, both daily

00:27:24.470 --> 00:27:27.660
and Sunday New York Times
reviewers sort of asked me

00:27:27.660 --> 00:27:30.120
to write another one in the series.

00:27:30.120 --> 00:27:34.470 position:56%
Although the guy in the Sunday Times
said that he had mixed feelings

00:27:34.470 --> 00:27:38.630
about it because they always had a
huge catastrophe as their backdrop.

00:27:38.630 --> 00:27:42.260
And he wasn't sure whether
he wanted to invite another.

00:27:42.260 --> 00:27:46.040
In this case it was the
financial crisis of 2008

00:27:46.040 --> 00:27:48.180
that was the backdrop
of the current book.

00:27:48.180 --> 00:27:53.170
&gt;&gt; Leigh: So, Jackie, Jay is
talking about how big events kind

00:27:53.170 --> 00:27:59.130
of infuse the characters or help
shape plots or characters' lives.

00:27:59.130 --> 00:28:05.220
Is that a factor when
you're creating a character?

00:28:05.220 --> 00:28:07.800
&gt;&gt; Jacqueline: Not always.

00:28:07.800 --> 00:28:11.440
As writers, of course, it's
an emotional factor, right?

00:28:11.440 --> 00:28:14.370
So something big happens,
and the emotion

00:28:14.370 --> 00:28:16.010
of it goes into the narrative.

00:28:16.010 --> 00:28:19.780
Like when I wrote Behind
You it was to place --

00:28:19.780 --> 00:28:24.830 position:56%
9/11 is not mentioned in it at all,
but it's all about loss and grieving

00:28:24.830 --> 00:28:29.190
and when people die suddenly and
what do you do with that emotion.

00:28:29.190 --> 00:28:36.060 position:56%
So I think that it's hard for us to
kind of separate our emotional lives

00:28:36.060 --> 00:28:41.350 position:56%
from the lives of our characters but
not necessarily physically putting

00:28:41.350 --> 00:28:42.890
that stuff into the narrative.

00:28:42.890 --> 00:28:46.000
&gt;&gt; Leigh: And August,
your background

00:28:46.000 --> 00:28:50.330
and August you share some
similarities, Brooklyn.

00:28:50.330 --> 00:28:52.860
&gt;&gt; Jacqueline: Yeah,
Brooklyn, Bushwick, definitely.

00:28:52.860 --> 00:28:54.160
&gt;&gt; Leigh: South Carolina.

00:28:54.160 --> 00:28:57.100 position:56%
&gt;&gt; Jacqueline: She's from Tennessee.

00:28:57.100 --> 00:29:03.240
But there are some
references in South Carolina.

00:29:03.240 --> 00:29:04.870
&gt;&gt; Jacqueline: She comes from
[inaudible] gentry basically.

00:29:04.870 --> 00:29:06.850
She comes from a family
that had a lot of land

00:29:06.850 --> 00:29:08.700
and then couldn't hold onto it.

00:29:08.700 --> 00:29:12.880
I didn't come from that.

00:29:12.880 --> 00:29:17.950
And definitely my uncle had
converted to the Nation of Islam,

00:29:17.950 --> 00:29:19.810
but we were raised
Jehovah's Witnesses.

00:29:19.810 --> 00:29:23.860
But when he came home from prison
and he was part of the Nation

00:29:23.860 --> 00:29:26.980
of Islam then my family I guess
thinking there wasn't enough

00:29:26.980 --> 00:29:29.930
religion in the house we
became part of the Nation

00:29:29.930 --> 00:29:32.820
of Islam as well as Witnesses.

00:29:32.820 --> 00:29:34.120
&gt;&gt; Leigh: Wow.

00:29:34.120 --> 00:29:35.570
That is a lot of religion.

00:29:35.570 --> 00:29:42.300
&gt;&gt; Jacqueline: Hence the no
sex in the young adult books.

00:29:42.300 --> 00:29:46.910
But the great thing about having
grown up with being both Muslin

00:29:46.910 --> 00:29:50.520 position:56%
and Christian is I'm a firm believer

00:29:50.520 --> 00:29:53.940
of Walt Whitman's argument
not concerning God.

00:29:53.940 --> 00:29:55.310
There's no argument there.

00:29:55.310 --> 00:29:59.140
But having known a
lot about the Nation

00:29:59.140 --> 00:30:02.050
of Islam I decided I wanted
to explore it further.

00:30:02.050 --> 00:30:05.540
So I did end up having to do a
lot of research on the religion

00:30:05.540 --> 00:30:08.970
because there was a lot of
stuff I didn't know about it.

00:30:08.970 --> 00:30:11.320
I'm not a big fan of research.

00:30:11.320 --> 00:30:13.830
But I also had to go back
and research Bushwick.

00:30:13.830 --> 00:30:18.210
Because I knew about the white
flight, I knew about the blackout.

00:30:18.210 --> 00:30:21.220
I knew about free lunch
programs and some of that stuff.

00:30:21.220 --> 00:30:24.490
But there was a lot of
stuff I didn't remember.

00:30:24.490 --> 00:30:25.790
And the music.

00:30:25.790 --> 00:30:27.090
&gt;&gt; Jay: You know it's funny

00:30:27.090 --> 00:30:29.880
because in your book all the
white people are fleeing Bushwick,

00:30:29.880 --> 00:30:31.990
and now they're all
going back to Bushwick.

00:30:31.990 --> 00:30:33.970
&gt;&gt; Jacqueline: I know, which is
part of the reason I wrote it

00:30:33.970 --> 00:30:35.840
because I think those
white people coming

00:30:35.840 --> 00:30:39.120
to Bushwick don't realize it
was a neighborhood inhabited

00:30:39.120 --> 00:30:41.130
by people who were thriving there.

00:30:41.130 --> 00:30:46.380
And that's why I dedicated
it for Bushwick 1970 to 1990

00:30:46.380 --> 00:30:50.340
because I think there is a way in
which people like to forget history

00:30:50.340 --> 00:30:52.580
and forget that this
was once a neighborhood

00:30:52.580 --> 00:30:55.250
that their ancestors were from,

00:30:55.250 --> 00:30:58.400
and here they're coming
back and discovering it.

00:30:58.400 --> 00:30:59.700
&gt;&gt; Leigh: Well, we don't have

00:30:59.700 --> 00:31:01.100
that much more time
before we go to questions.

00:31:01.100 --> 00:31:04.850
But there's another similarity
that I think you both share,

00:31:04.850 --> 00:31:09.610
and that is that you both -- Jay,
in your case you shot to fame

00:31:09.610 --> 00:31:12.740
when you were, what, 29 with
Bright Lights, Big City.

00:31:12.740 --> 00:31:14.520
And in your case, Jackie --

00:31:14.520 --> 00:31:19.510
and received tons of critical
praises and prizes and so on.

00:31:19.510 --> 00:31:25.670
And in Jackie's case winning
some really wonderful awards,

00:31:25.670 --> 00:31:31.650
the Caldecott, the National
Book Award, Coretta Scott King.

00:31:31.650 --> 00:31:36.550 position:56%
So you've had, you know, sort of
benchmarks in your career that a lot

00:31:36.550 --> 00:31:38.460
of writers never get to, right?

00:31:38.460 --> 00:31:39.760
&gt;&gt; Jacqueline: Mm-hmm.

00:31:39.760 --> 00:31:41.150
&gt;&gt; Leigh: So let's start with you.

00:31:41.150 --> 00:31:46.210
What did it mean to you to begin
to receive that kind of accolade?

00:31:46.210 --> 00:31:50.310
&gt;&gt; Jacqueline: I always
thing of the awards, I mean,

00:31:50.310 --> 00:31:53.560
as something that is
for that book, right?

00:31:53.560 --> 00:31:57.290
Even the Lifetime Achievement Award
they're for that body of work,

00:31:57.290 --> 00:32:01.440
but it's not necessarily for
anything I'm going forth to do.

00:32:01.440 --> 00:32:03.940
And I think that's the
thing that keeps me writing.

00:32:03.940 --> 00:32:07.700
I think I am very grateful that
I didn't get my first Newbery

00:32:07.700 --> 00:32:10.250 position:56%
until about my seventh book I think.

00:32:10.250 --> 00:32:15.630
And that kind of -- it definitely
helped me keep a perspective

00:32:15.630 --> 00:32:18.520
on why I was doing
the work I was doing.

00:32:18.520 --> 00:32:20.760
I was grateful for the awards.

00:32:20.760 --> 00:32:23.250
I like the metals, I like
putting the stickers on my book.

00:32:23.250 --> 00:32:32.570
But I think it did give
me this kind of faith

00:32:32.570 --> 00:32:35.050
to be able to keep doing the work.

00:32:35.050 --> 00:32:38.040 position:56%
But you know writers are introverts.

00:32:38.040 --> 00:32:41.730
So one thing that comes
with the awards is this.

00:32:41.730 --> 00:32:44.100 position:56%
&gt;&gt; Leigh: Out facing a sea of faces.

00:32:44.100 --> 00:32:45.400
And, Jay, you've --

00:32:45.400 --> 00:32:51.250 position:56%
&gt;&gt; Jay: Well, Jacqueline has won far
more awards than I have and prizes.

00:32:51.250 --> 00:32:55.060
Most of mine came from
France and Italy actually.

00:32:55.060 --> 00:32:59.450
I did have a very large success
of my first novel, though,

00:32:59.450 --> 00:33:02.610
and no one could have
more surprised than I was.

00:33:02.610 --> 00:33:06.010
I was kind of hoping to
get a few good reviews

00:33:06.010 --> 00:33:09.750
so I could get a teaching job
or a newspaper job out of it.

00:33:09.750 --> 00:33:14.650
And that seemed like the only
reasonable expectation at the time.

00:33:14.650 --> 00:33:19.310
I had worked at Random House
reading manuscripts as kind

00:33:19.310 --> 00:33:23.030
of an underpaid assistant.

00:33:23.030 --> 00:33:25.310
And I had seen lots
of books published

00:33:25.310 --> 00:33:29.950
with no fanfare, no
acclaim whatsoever.

00:33:29.950 --> 00:33:33.520
And the vice president
of Random House took me

00:33:33.520 --> 00:33:36.810
out for lunch shortly before
publication and he said, look,

00:33:36.810 --> 00:33:41.950
the novel is dying, nobody in
your generation reads anymore.

00:33:41.950 --> 00:33:45.120
You wrote a nice book
but don't expect much.

00:33:45.120 --> 00:33:47.890
&gt;&gt; Leigh: And that
was way before Kindle.

00:33:47.890 --> 00:33:49.190
&gt;&gt; Jacqueline: Wow.

00:33:49.190 --> 00:33:52.460
&gt;&gt; Jay: And it turned
out that for a variety

00:33:52.460 --> 00:33:56.270
of reasons the book became
extremely successful.

00:33:56.270 --> 00:33:59.270
And I think the main thing it
did was it gave me a career

00:33:59.270 --> 00:34:05.460
because I was able to then
go on and write full time.

00:34:05.460 --> 00:34:09.410
I didn't end up taking a
teaching job or a newspaper job,

00:34:09.410 --> 00:34:14.280
and I'm really grateful for that.

00:34:14.280 --> 00:34:15.810
And I'm still writing.

00:34:15.810 --> 00:34:17.800
&gt;&gt; Leigh: And you're still writing.

00:34:17.800 --> 00:34:19.560
You're both such wonderful writers.

00:34:19.560 --> 00:34:20.860
&gt;&gt; Jacqueline: Thanks, Leigh.

00:34:20.860 --> 00:34:22.620
&gt;&gt; Leigh: We have to
wind it down a little bit

00:34:22.620 --> 00:34:24.830
so we can begin to take questions.

00:34:24.830 --> 00:34:30.030
We have ten minutes for questions
or should we keep talking up here?

00:34:30.030 --> 00:34:37.620
Okay. All right, so who would like
to start with the first question?

00:34:37.620 --> 00:34:42.210
&gt;&gt; So I have a question
for Jacqueline Woodson.

00:34:42.210 --> 00:34:45.510
I read your children's books
to my students all the time.

00:34:45.510 --> 00:34:46.810
I loved The Other Side.

00:34:46.810 --> 00:34:50.210
Each Kindness, they're
just such powerful books.

00:34:50.210 --> 00:34:53.040 position:56%
And I was wondering how is writing
a children's book which is something

00:34:53.040 --> 00:34:58.400
that I'm trying to do different
than writing a young adult book,

00:34:58.400 --> 00:35:01.970
and what pointers do you
have for someone like me?

00:35:01.970 --> 00:35:03.420
&gt;&gt; Jacqueline: Well,
thanks for sharing them.

00:35:03.420 --> 00:35:05.840
Writing a picture book is the
absolute hardest thing you

00:35:05.840 --> 00:35:07.140
can write.

00:35:07.140 --> 00:35:09.590
When you think of the attention
span you're working with,

00:35:09.590 --> 00:35:11.420
how you have to get
in there immediately

00:35:11.420 --> 00:35:13.470
and take it line by line.

00:35:13.470 --> 00:35:16.480
And if you lose them by the
third line they're gone.

00:35:16.480 --> 00:35:19.650
So I think it's important to read
a lot of poetry if you're thinking

00:35:19.650 --> 00:35:21.900
about writing books
for the very young.

00:35:21.900 --> 00:35:25.700 position:56%
I didn't come to picture books until
I had written about eight or nine --

00:35:25.700 --> 00:35:28.530
no, it was actually my twelfth
young adult middle grade book

00:35:28.530 --> 00:35:31.480
and then I wrote a picture book.

00:35:31.480 --> 00:35:33.110 position:56%
But I think that that's really hard.

00:35:33.110 --> 00:35:36.650
And the only way you can do it
is really reading a lot of poetry

00:35:36.650 --> 00:35:39.220
and reading a lot of picture books.

00:35:39.220 --> 00:35:42.920 position:56%
I've probably -- young adult writing
is a little bit easier for me

00:35:42.920 --> 00:35:44.250
than writing picture books.

00:35:44.250 --> 00:35:45.550
&gt;&gt; Leigh: Can I just ask --

00:35:45.550 --> 00:35:46.850
&gt;&gt; Jacqueline: Sure.

00:35:46.850 --> 00:35:48.150
&gt;&gt; Leigh: I've always been
curious about the process

00:35:48.150 --> 00:35:51.300
between the illustrator
and the writer.

00:35:51.300 --> 00:35:52.600
What is that like?

00:35:52.600 --> 00:35:54.370
&gt;&gt; Jacqueline: So I get
to choose my illustrators.

00:35:54.370 --> 00:35:57.300
But once I choose them I'm not
allowed to talk to them at all.

00:35:57.300 --> 00:35:58.600
&gt;&gt; Leigh: Wow.

00:35:58.600 --> 00:35:59.960
&gt;&gt; Jacqueline: Except for Show
Way because that was a story

00:35:59.960 --> 00:36:02.840
of my family, and I used
family photographs and stuff.

00:36:02.840 --> 00:36:05.920
And so basically it's the
illustrated interpretation

00:36:05.920 --> 00:36:08.110
of the narrative, and
then the two come together

00:36:08.110 --> 00:36:09.410
to form this other thing.

00:36:09.410 --> 00:36:13.740
And so with The Other Side I got
to see sketches and some paintings.

00:36:13.740 --> 00:36:16.280
But you really are not
supposed to have a dialogue.

00:36:16.280 --> 00:36:18.110
And with the picture book
the pictures should stand

00:36:18.110 --> 00:36:19.950
on their own without the words.

00:36:19.950 --> 00:36:22.470
And the words should stand on
their own without the pictures.

00:36:22.470 --> 00:36:25.140
So when you submit a
book to a publisher

00:36:25.140 --> 00:36:27.380
that story has to stand on its own.

00:36:27.380 --> 00:36:31.190
And the publisher has to be able to
imagine what the illustrations --

00:36:31.190 --> 00:36:33.390
what the book would
look like illustrated.

00:36:33.390 --> 00:36:34.690
&gt;&gt; Thank you.

00:36:34.690 --> 00:36:35.990
&gt;&gt; Leigh: Thanks for the question.

00:36:35.990 --> 00:36:37.290
&gt;&gt; This is for Jay.

00:36:37.290 --> 00:36:40.460
In addition to your fiction I've
always enjoyed your wine writing.

00:36:40.460 --> 00:36:43.000
Do you plan on doing any
more of that in the future?

00:36:43.000 --> 00:36:47.900
&gt;&gt; Jay: Yeah, I have a
kind of second career

00:36:47.900 --> 00:36:50.680
as a wine writer and wine critic.

00:36:50.680 --> 00:36:54.840
It started almost 20 years ago when
a friend of mine took over House

00:36:54.840 --> 00:36:58.360
and Garden Magazine and
wanted a wine column.

00:36:58.360 --> 00:37:01.860
And she thought as a reader

00:37:01.860 --> 00:37:04.940
and consumer she found most wine
writing to be pretty boring.

00:37:04.940 --> 00:37:08.500
And she asked me if I
would be interested.

00:37:08.500 --> 00:37:12.620
And I protested that I
didn't really know enough.

00:37:12.620 --> 00:37:16.490
But she felt that, you know,
just to be a passionate amateur

00:37:16.490 --> 00:37:22.020
who had some writing chops
might be a good place to start.

00:37:22.020 --> 00:37:26.950
And it's become strange -- I
agreed to do it for six months,

00:37:26.950 --> 00:37:30.200
and I'm still doing it 20 years
later, although I moved from House

00:37:30.200 --> 00:37:32.130
and Garden to the Wall
Street Journal.

00:37:32.130 --> 00:37:37.090
I'm still writing about wine
for Town &amp; Country Magazine.

00:37:37.090 --> 00:37:41.630
I've published three collections
of essays about wine for those

00:37:41.630 --> 00:37:45.150
of you who are interested.

00:37:45.150 --> 00:37:52.300
And I certainly try to write
from a perspective that is not

00:37:52.300 --> 00:37:56.760
that of a specialist or an expert.

00:37:56.760 --> 00:38:04.140
It's a great -- it's a great kind
of relaxation from writing fiction.

00:38:04.140 --> 00:38:09.960
I find it a little
easier, a lot more fun,

00:38:09.960 --> 00:38:11.830
and it gets me out of the house.

00:38:11.830 --> 00:38:15.440
And, yeah, I'm going
to keep doing it.

00:38:15.440 --> 00:38:17.480
&gt;&gt; Leigh: Thank you
for your question.

00:38:17.480 --> 00:38:21.680
&gt;&gt; So I'm a Chicago girl, but
I love Greenpoint in Brooklyn,

00:38:21.680 --> 00:38:25.460
I love Waynesburg in Queens.

00:38:25.460 --> 00:38:29.620
As New York today [inaudible]
are the same as 20 years ago.

00:38:29.620 --> 00:38:32.190
So when you're writing
about during the past

00:38:32.190 --> 00:38:36.950
in your books how do you guard
against I'm trying to write history

00:38:36.950 --> 00:38:39.440
but how do you guard against
writing about nostalgia?

00:38:39.440 --> 00:38:42.500
They're two different things.

00:38:42.500 --> 00:38:44.370
&gt;&gt; Jay: Well, I think
I write about both.

00:38:44.370 --> 00:38:45.670
&gt;&gt; Jacqueline: Yeah, it's both.

00:38:45.670 --> 00:38:47.570
I feel like it's both.

00:38:47.570 --> 00:38:51.980
We're writing about
history nostalgically.

00:38:51.980 --> 00:38:53.980
So it is a balance.

00:38:53.980 --> 00:38:56.470
They're both in there.

00:38:56.470 --> 00:38:59.300
&gt;&gt; Jay: I think my characters --

00:38:59.300 --> 00:39:06.240 position:56%
I mean this book is already somewhat
historical because it's about more

00:39:06.240 --> 00:39:11.200
or less the financial
crisis of 2008.

00:39:11.200 --> 00:39:15.150
And my characters in turn are
looking back often further

00:39:15.150 --> 00:39:18.110
to the days of their youth.

00:39:18.110 --> 00:39:21.440
And I think there's very
few of us who aren't prone

00:39:21.440 --> 00:39:25.270
to nostalgia particularly
when we get a little older.

00:39:27.110 --> 00:39:28.580
&gt;&gt; Leigh: Thank you.

00:39:28.580 --> 00:39:29.880
Yes?

00:39:29.880 --> 00:39:31.180
&gt;&gt; Hi, my question
is for Ms. Woodson.

00:39:31.180 --> 00:39:35.060
I am a fourth grade teacher, I
teach reading and Virginia history.

00:39:35.060 --> 00:39:38.660 position:56%
And one of the biggest questions
that kinds of looms over my students

00:39:38.660 --> 00:39:42.330
in their touch screen world
is why are books important,

00:39:42.330 --> 00:39:44.560
why is reading important?

00:39:44.560 --> 00:39:49.730
And I'm just wondering
what you would say to them.

00:39:49.730 --> 00:39:51.940
&gt;&gt; Jacqueline: You know,
it's a good question.

00:39:51.940 --> 00:39:54.110
I think as a teacher, of course,

00:39:54.110 --> 00:39:57.040
we know you set the
tone in the room, right?

00:39:57.040 --> 00:40:00.980
That's the power of teaching
is you get to decide everything

00:40:00.980 --> 00:40:05.720
from letting the kids choose
their own preferred gender pronoun

00:40:05.720 --> 00:40:09.200
to having big conversations
about race and economic classes.

00:40:09.200 --> 00:40:16.330
All you. And I think in terms
of reading, I mean I think Jay

00:40:16.330 --> 00:40:19.720
and I could both answer
this, reading is everywhere.

00:40:19.720 --> 00:40:23.560
Reading is so necessary in
every single part of your life

00:40:23.560 --> 00:40:30.830
from reading the directions for
the Pokemon app to reading the back

00:40:30.830 --> 00:40:37.590
of a cereal box to reading a
really good book or a comic strip.

00:40:37.590 --> 00:40:40.320
Words are everywhere, and
they're going to be with us

00:40:40.320 --> 00:40:41.980
for the rest of our lives.

00:40:41.980 --> 00:40:45.920
Even if the ways we read
change there's always going

00:40:45.920 --> 00:40:48.320
to be the need for
that context, right?

00:40:48.320 --> 00:40:52.370
So they're going to
need it in their lives.

00:40:52.370 --> 00:40:55.180 position:56%
&gt;&gt; Leigh: How do you respond to
your students when they ask you that

00:40:55.180 --> 00:40:57.670
or when the question is in the air.

00:40:57.670 --> 00:41:02.750
&gt;&gt; I respond by saying that books
helps us understand ourselves,

00:41:02.750 --> 00:41:05.320
they help us understand
other people.

00:41:05.320 --> 00:41:09.310
And through that understanding
they make us better people.

00:41:09.310 --> 00:41:10.870
&gt;&gt; Leigh: Yeah, and I think
all of us probably share --

00:41:10.870 --> 00:41:15.170 position:56%
Jay was talking a little bit earlier
about being a passionate amateur.

00:41:15.170 --> 00:41:20.940
When people ask like me, for
example, being a book editor

00:41:20.940 --> 00:41:24.180
in my past or being the
books editor for a magazine,

00:41:24.180 --> 00:41:26.430
is there some big industry.

00:41:26.430 --> 00:41:29.290
Yes, there's an industry, but
I think we probably all started

00:41:29.290 --> 00:41:32.370
by just being readers, like
being in love with reading,

00:41:32.370 --> 00:41:38.490
addicted to reading, using books
as like a shield or a way in.

00:41:38.490 --> 00:41:44.670
And it's so miraculous that
we're able to inhabit or travel

00:41:44.670 --> 00:41:48.630
to someone else's mind or another
country just by sitting there

00:41:48.630 --> 00:41:50.810
with something in front of us.

00:41:50.810 --> 00:41:52.380
Pretty amazing.

00:41:52.380 --> 00:41:56.250
Jay, do you have anything
to add on that subject?

00:41:56.250 --> 00:42:00.540 position:56%
&gt;&gt; Jay: Yeah, I couldn't agree more.

00:42:00.540 --> 00:42:07.000
For me I was a great nomadic kid.

00:42:07.000 --> 00:42:13.770
My dad changed jobs every seven
or eight months it seemed.

00:42:13.770 --> 00:42:16.670
And reading became my
source of companionship

00:42:16.670 --> 00:42:21.180
and also my window
onto the wider world.

00:42:21.180 --> 00:42:22.480
&gt;&gt; Leigh: Yes?

00:42:22.480 --> 00:42:25.950
&gt;&gt; I have a question
for Ms. Woodson.

00:42:25.950 --> 00:42:30.430
How did you start your own
book and your own series?

00:42:30.430 --> 00:42:34.140
&gt;&gt; Jacqueline: How did
I start my own book?

00:42:34.140 --> 00:42:37.370
I've known I wanted to be
a writer since I was seven.

00:42:37.370 --> 00:42:39.910
And I talk about it in
Brown Girl Dreaming.

00:42:39.910 --> 00:42:41.980
I got in trouble for lying a lot,

00:42:41.980 --> 00:42:44.100
and I had a teacher
who said write it down.

00:42:44.100 --> 00:42:50.330
And it was such a strong -- I
was constantly making up stories,

00:42:50.330 --> 00:42:54.210
but I was also bored a lot.

00:42:54.210 --> 00:42:55.870
I think that's the difference

00:42:55.870 --> 00:42:59.810
between my kids and
who is was as a kid.

00:42:59.810 --> 00:43:03.270
We had commercials, television
went off at six o'clock

00:43:03.270 --> 00:43:04.580
and then the news came on.

00:43:04.580 --> 00:43:05.880
We had three channels.

00:43:05.880 --> 00:43:07.640
So there were all these places.

00:43:07.640 --> 00:43:09.730
I was in houses of worship a lot,

00:43:09.730 --> 00:43:11.610
so there were a lot
of places to be bored.

00:43:11.610 --> 00:43:16.830
[Laughter] And I would make
up stories and I would write.

00:43:16.830 --> 00:43:18.780
And I just kept doing it.

00:43:18.780 --> 00:43:21.040
I didn't know that it
would eventually be this.

00:43:21.040 --> 00:43:25.040
But I knew that I needed to
do it for my own salvation.

00:43:25.040 --> 00:43:26.660
&gt;&gt; Leigh: When did you
start writing it down?

00:43:26.660 --> 00:43:28.390
&gt;&gt; Jacqueline: When I was seven.

00:43:28.390 --> 00:43:30.300
When I learned how to write my name

00:43:30.300 --> 00:43:33.730
from that point I realized how
powerful putting letters together

00:43:33.730 --> 00:43:36.110
and words together and
words making sentences

00:43:36.110 --> 00:43:37.750
and sentences making paragraphs.

00:43:37.750 --> 00:43:42.290
Like that was mind blowing to
me that it was just that simple.

00:43:42.290 --> 00:43:46.540
And that what was in my head
I could actually put on paper

00:43:46.540 --> 00:43:47.840
and it could be something.

00:43:47.840 --> 00:43:50.050
&gt;&gt; Leigh: Do you want
to be a writer?

00:43:50.050 --> 00:43:51.350
&gt;&gt; Yes. [Applause]

00:43:51.350 --> 00:43:53.650
&gt;&gt; Jay: Stick with it.

00:43:55.960 --> 00:44:00.450
&gt;&gt; Hi, this is for Jay.

00:44:00.450 --> 00:44:04.290
I know you're very renowned
as a Manhattan writer.

00:44:04.290 --> 00:44:07.500
But I have to take issue with
the first thing you said.

00:44:07.500 --> 00:44:08.800
&gt;&gt; Jay: Uh-oh.

00:44:08.800 --> 00:44:10.810
&gt;&gt; Of your description
of Manhattan in the 80s.

00:44:10.810 --> 00:44:15.560
I've lived in Manhattan all
through for about 40 years.

00:44:15.560 --> 00:44:18.920
And I raised a child in the
80s on the upper west side,

00:44:18.920 --> 00:44:22.610
and your description is
totally unrecognizable to me.

00:44:22.610 --> 00:44:24.950
There were no crack vials
I was stepping over.

00:44:24.950 --> 00:44:30.050
I mean a gross generalization of
what was a problem in New York.

00:44:30.050 --> 00:44:31.720
&gt;&gt; Jay: Well, there
were these pockets --

00:44:31.720 --> 00:44:33.290
&gt;&gt; Yes, of course.

00:44:33.290 --> 00:44:36.610
&gt;&gt; Jay: There were these pockets of
civilization, the upper west side

00:44:36.610 --> 00:44:42.450
and the upper east side were these
long- established residential areas

00:44:42.450 --> 00:44:44.370
where families were raised.

00:44:44.370 --> 00:44:45.720
But around the edges --

00:44:45.720 --> 00:44:47.310
&gt;&gt; Of course, I wouldn't
disagree with that.

00:44:47.310 --> 00:44:50.130
&gt;&gt; Jay: And for that matter
Amsterdam Avenue and Needle Park

00:44:50.130 --> 00:44:54.850
on the upper west side
when I arrived in New York

00:44:54.850 --> 00:44:56.150
in the early 80s it was

00:44:56.150 --> 00:44:58.740
like Amsterdam Avenue
was almost uncrossable.

00:44:58.740 --> 00:45:00.250
It was pretty dangerous.

00:45:00.250 --> 00:45:05.020
&gt;&gt; I cross it every day.

00:45:05.020 --> 00:45:08.300
&gt;&gt; Leigh: One little girl,
this is our last question.

00:45:08.300 --> 00:45:12.100
&gt;&gt; Jay: Last question.

00:45:12.100 --> 00:45:15.250
&gt;&gt; Can I make this shorter?

00:45:15.250 --> 00:45:20.680
&gt;&gt; Leigh: Just bend
it down towards you.

00:45:20.680 --> 00:45:21.980
What's your name?

00:45:21.980 --> 00:45:23.280
&gt;&gt; My name is Margaret.

00:45:23.280 --> 00:45:24.580
&gt;&gt; Leigh: Hi, Margaret.

00:45:24.580 --> 00:45:27.180
&gt;&gt; And this is for Mrs. Woodson.

00:45:27.180 --> 00:45:30.250
What's your favorite medium
like when you're writing.

00:45:30.250 --> 00:45:32.970
&gt;&gt; Jacqueline: Thanks for
your question, Margaret.

00:45:32.970 --> 00:45:35.740
And I love that you
adjusted the mic first.

00:45:35.740 --> 00:45:39.030
I usually start writing by hand.

00:45:39.030 --> 00:45:42.200
And when the ideas start coming
fast I move to the computer,

00:45:42.200 --> 00:45:44.600
and then I go back
to writing by hand.

00:45:44.600 --> 00:45:47.260
So I go back and forth.

00:45:47.260 --> 00:45:49.460
Just because I always have
a pad and a pen somewhere,

00:45:49.460 --> 00:45:52.910
and I write on my hand sometimes.

00:45:52.910 --> 00:45:55.120
I don't have any today.

00:45:55.120 --> 00:45:57.870
Today is a bust.

00:45:57.870 --> 00:46:01.690
But, yeah, I have a
ton of pens right now.

00:46:01.690 --> 00:46:07.130
So, yeah, by hand and then I have
a laptop that I carry everywhere.

00:46:07.130 --> 00:46:10.690
Viking will be able
to tell you that.

00:46:10.690 --> 00:46:11.990
So thank you.

00:46:11.990 --> 00:46:13.290
Thanks, everyone.

00:46:13.290 --> 00:46:14.590
&gt;&gt; Leigh: Thanks very much.

00:46:14.590 --> 00:46:15.890
&gt;&gt; Jay: Thank you.

00:46:15.890 --> 00:46:17.190
[Applause]

00:46:17.190 --> 00:46:20.340

of the Library of Congress.
