00:00:05.169 --> 00:00:08.879
When Humans Started Shaving Different Parts
of Our Bodies

00:00:08.879 --> 00:00:12.589
Both sexes have a love-hate relationship with
removing body hair.

00:00:12.589 --> 00:00:17.770
We’ve been pulling, plucking, burning, tweezing
and ripping out undesirable hair since the

00:00:17.770 --> 00:00:18.880
dawn of time.

00:00:18.880 --> 00:00:24.670
It’s believed that as far back as 4,000
B.C., women were using dangerous substances

00:00:24.670 --> 00:00:27.550
like arsenic and quicklime to get the job
done.

00:00:27.550 --> 00:00:32.870
Meanwhile, the Egyptians, who never did anything
halfway, removed all of their body hair from

00:00:32.870 --> 00:00:34.140
head to toe.

00:00:34.140 --> 00:00:38.300
They really liked the sleek look, but it also
had a practical purpose.

00:00:38.300 --> 00:00:44.100
Being hairless discouraged the spread of disease
and vermin such as lice and other icky creepy-crawlies.

00:00:44.100 --> 00:00:49.230
By 500 B.C., Roman ladies had learned how
to use pumice stones and even a primitive

00:00:49.230 --> 00:00:50.819
version of the razor.

00:00:50.819 --> 00:00:53.409
Let’s fast-forward to more recent times.

00:00:53.409 --> 00:00:57.749
When did our modern-day obsession with silky-smooth
armpits and legs first take hold?

00:00:57.749 --> 00:01:02.260
As far as armpits are concerned, we can pinpoint
it almost to the day.

00:01:02.260 --> 00:01:08.040
In May of 1915, the upscale magazine Harper’s
Bazaar ran an ad featuring a young model in

00:01:08.040 --> 00:01:12.979
a sleeveless, slip-like dress posing with
both arms over her head.

00:01:12.979 --> 00:01:14.510
You may be thinking, “So what?”

00:01:14.510 --> 00:01:18.140
Well, up until that time, fashion – and
propriety – dictated that women were covered

00:01:18.140 --> 00:01:20.180
to the wrist and to the ankle.

00:01:20.180 --> 00:01:24.180
A dress that exposed the underarms was nothing
short of revolutionary.

00:01:24.180 --> 00:01:29.200
In fact, just the utterance of the word “underarm”
out loud was enough to call for the smelling

00:01:29.200 --> 00:01:30.909
salts mere weeks earlier.

00:01:30.909 --> 00:01:33.750
Now, it was becoming perfectly acceptable.

00:01:33.750 --> 00:01:37.929
It also meant since underarms were body parts
that had always been covered, whether or not

00:01:37.929 --> 00:01:41.579
they needed shaving had been a moot point
and little discussed.

00:01:41.579 --> 00:01:43.799
If it didn’t show, why bother?

00:01:43.799 --> 00:01:48.259
And yet, here was an ad cajoling women that
it was necessary to remove “objectionable”

00:01:48.259 --> 00:01:49.259
hair.

00:01:49.259 --> 00:01:53.850
To think just days earlier women had no idea
such a problem even existed!

00:01:53.850 --> 00:01:58.210
There were several marketing strategies employed
to lure women into jumping on the shaving

00:01:58.210 --> 00:02:02.670
bandwagon, most of which appealed to the timeless
desire to be trendy.

00:02:02.670 --> 00:02:07.310
The obsession worked its way down to the middle
class slowly but surely, as sleeveless and

00:02:07.310 --> 00:02:10.440
sheer dresses became popular among that demographic.

00:02:10.440 --> 00:02:14.790
Women’s razors and depilatories were finally
being offered for sale in the Sears Roebuck

00:02:14.790 --> 00:02:16.930
catalog in 1922.

00:02:16.930 --> 00:02:21.040
This was the same year they started to sell
– you guessed it – sleeveless and sheer

00:02:21.040 --> 00:02:22.040
dresses.

00:02:22.040 --> 00:02:26.920
By this point, advertisers didn’t feel the
need to justify their product’s purpose

00:02:26.920 --> 00:02:30.849
anymore, and could instead start spending
their budgets differentiating their product

00:02:30.849 --> 00:02:32.220
from their competitors.

00:02:32.220 --> 00:02:34.500
This meant that women had been won over – or
brainwashed as some might say – and it was

00:02:34.500 --> 00:02:39.959
no longer a question of convincing them if
they should shave their underarms in advertisements;

00:02:39.959 --> 00:02:44.129
now it came down to convincing them that a
particular product was the best choice to

00:02:44.129 --> 00:02:49.090
remove the hair that women didn’t realize
until recently was objectionable in the first

00:02:49.090 --> 00:02:50.090
place.

00:02:50.090 --> 00:02:52.239
The leg shaving phenomenon was a lot slower
to catch on.

00:02:52.239 --> 00:02:56.540
It’s true that during the 1920s the flappers
brought with them a decade of much shorter

00:02:56.540 --> 00:03:01.739
dresses coming into vogue, but by the 1930s
hemlines became much longer again.

00:03:01.739 --> 00:03:06.670
There were some fashion and beauty writers
loudly proclaiming that leg hair was on a

00:03:06.670 --> 00:03:10.250
par with leprosy, boldly referring to it as
a “curse”.

00:03:10.250 --> 00:03:15.040
Regardless, it seemed that the majority of
women were content to leave well enough alone

00:03:15.040 --> 00:03:17.390
and not worry about shaving their legs.

00:03:17.390 --> 00:03:22.019
The fashion mavens just couldn’t stir up
the same frenzy this time around as they had

00:03:22.019 --> 00:03:23.030
with armpit hair.

00:03:23.030 --> 00:03:27.740
It seems that most women were a tad more hesitant
when it came to shaving and therefore drawing

00:03:27.740 --> 00:03:31.099
attention to their legs, as opposed to their
underarms.

00:03:31.099 --> 00:03:34.519
After all, the leg’s closest neighbors are
the “private” bits.

00:03:34.519 --> 00:03:39.590
You wouldn’t want anyone to think you were
that kind of girl, or give men any kind of

00:03:39.590 --> 00:03:40.620
wrong impression.

00:03:40.620 --> 00:03:45.670
Then World War II erupted, and that iconic
pin-up picture of Betty Grable became part

00:03:45.670 --> 00:03:47.780
of popular culture almost overnight.

00:03:47.780 --> 00:03:52.700
It’s only a slight exaggeration to say that
the women of America have been shaving their

00:03:52.700 --> 00:03:54.120
legs ever since.

00:03:54.120 --> 00:03:55.730
Why, you ask?

00:03:55.730 --> 00:03:59.849
Because Betty’s legs looked amazing, and
to emulate that look, you had to wear a short

00:03:59.849 --> 00:04:01.769
skirt and sheer stockings.

00:04:01.769 --> 00:04:05.350
You also had to shave your legs, as nothing
killed the effect you were trying to create

00:04:05.350 --> 00:04:08.540
more than leg hair poking through your silky
stockings.

00:04:08.540 --> 00:04:10.319
Now, what about the guys?

00:04:10.319 --> 00:04:13.580
It’s impossible to know who the first men
to shave their beards were.

00:04:13.580 --> 00:04:19.090
It’s pretty certain the story begins during
the Stone Age, where cave paintings show Neanderthal

00:04:19.090 --> 00:04:23.790
man using seashells as tweezers to pluck out
unwanted hairs.

00:04:23.790 --> 00:04:27.950
Flint blades, believed to be the first razors
used for shaving, have been dated back as

00:04:27.950 --> 00:04:33.750
far as 30,000 B.C. Flint would provide a very
sharp edge, but would also become dull very

00:04:33.750 --> 00:04:34.750
quickly.

00:04:34.750 --> 00:04:39.540
Therefore, it’s probably safe to say that
flint was man’s first disposable razor.

00:04:39.540 --> 00:04:44.070
There is evidence that in ancient times Egyptian
men shaved their beards for religious as well

00:04:44.070 --> 00:04:45.570
as aesthetic purposes.

00:04:45.570 --> 00:04:49.390
For the most part, it’s the Egyptians who
are given credit for introducing shaving as

00:04:49.390 --> 00:04:52.140
part of a daily hygienic routine.

00:04:52.140 --> 00:04:56.390
Shaving was very important to Egyptian men,
as facial hair was indicative of personal

00:04:56.390 --> 00:05:01.700
neglect- so much so that affluent people typically
kept a barber as a member of their household

00:05:01.700 --> 00:05:02.700
staff.

00:05:02.700 --> 00:05:05.970
Alexander the Great is thought by some to
have introduced the practice of shaving to

00:05:05.970 --> 00:05:08.420
the Greeks around 300 B.C.

00:05:08.420 --> 00:05:14.110
Even if his role there is overstated, he definitely
was a huge proponent of it and helped popularize

00:05:14.110 --> 00:05:15.690
shaving among the Greeks.

00:05:15.690 --> 00:05:20.410
It is thought he took up the practice of shaving
his beard as a beard gives the enemy something

00:05:20.410 --> 00:05:25.570
to grab onto during battle, putting soldiers
with beards at a distinct disadvantage.

00:05:25.570 --> 00:05:30.710
Not surprisingly, cropped hair and closely
shaven skin became all the rage in Greece

00:05:30.710 --> 00:05:31.790
at the time.

00:05:31.790 --> 00:05:36.270
There was soon a definite divide between the
shaven and the unshaven – at least as far

00:05:36.270 --> 00:05:38.420
as the shaven were concerned anyway.

00:05:38.420 --> 00:05:43.770
In fact, some etymologists think that the
term “barbarian” actually comes from “barba”,

00:05:43.770 --> 00:05:44.770
meaning “beard”.

00:05:44.770 --> 00:05:49.770
Hence, barbarians were simply all those who
were “unbarbered” or didn’t shave.

00:05:49.770 --> 00:05:54.740
(An alternate theory is that “barbarian”
comes from the Proto-Indo-Eurpoean root *barbar,

00:05:54.740 --> 00:05:58.730
meaning something to the effect of “stammering”
or “unintelligible”, referring to the

00:05:58.730 --> 00:06:01.360
people’s language, rather than lack of shaving.)

00:06:01.360 --> 00:06:05.280
Whatever the case, it’s plain to see that
our relationship with the removal of unwanted

00:06:05.280 --> 00:06:09.930
body hair is a long and colorful one.

00:06:09.930 --> 00:06:33.130
Once mankind was gifted with the invention
of toilet paper to ball up and staunch the

00:06:33.130 --> 00:06:38.060
bleeding from the inevitable shaving-induced
nicks and cuts, we could realize just how

00:06:38.060 --> 00:06:42.500
difficult the landscape our ancestors had
to traverse really was.
