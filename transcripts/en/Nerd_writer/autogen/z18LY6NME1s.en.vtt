00:00:03.399 --> 00:00:05.130
 I think it should be Stephen Frye. 

00:00:05.130 --> 00:00:12.210
 Once said: "A real thing is a lie after being badly expressed." This is the theory. 

00:00:12.910 --> 00:00:15.929
 The language you speak determines how you think and... 

00:00:16.600 --> 00:00:24.479
 Yes, it will affect how you look at everything. The key to the problem is: no expression, no expression, no content 

00:00:24.480 --> 00:00:31.199
 There is no form, an idea that feels profound to you, does not exist. 

00:00:31.840 --> 00:00:34.889
 Until you can write it down, or in some cases 

00:00:35.580 --> 00:00:43.020
 Put it in the movie. Watching Dennis Villeneuve’s Advent is to watch the film director’s mastery of the language, he presets 

00:00:43.600 --> 00:00:46.980
 The point is just to show: He has a strong film 

00:00:47.140 --> 00:00:52.460
 ability. I feel as a fan, I can hardly tell you how comfortable this is. 

00:00:52.469 --> 00:00:56.639
 When you are in a world built by people who know how to create movies 

00:00:56.920 --> 00:01:02.100
 Many of the films are now scattered so much that the audience has to pay 

00:01:02.440 --> 00:01:09.510
 More energy to compensate for the distraction. In this regard, I think that Advent has seen so much for us. 

00:01:09.510 --> 00:01:16.469
 The rotten film made a perfect response. Almost all other films made mistakes, "Advent" is doing the right thing, this action is effective and influential. 

00:01:16.470 --> 00:01:21.059
 And it looks at focusing on the things that affect and impact us. 

00:01:21.729 --> 00:01:29.459
 "Language" But I think "Advent" also focuses on the language of the film, just like writing, verbal or alien 

00:01:29.460 --> 00:01:33.449
 Languages, such as the beginning of several scenes, are a bit like 

00:01:33.820 --> 00:01:41.549
 Amplification experiment of the Kulesov effect - the phenomenon that the audience gets meaning from two consecutive shots, Hitchcock is famous 

00:01:41.680 --> 00:01:47.639
 Turning a gentle gentleman into a pervert with a reverse lens 

00:01:47.829 --> 00:01:49.799
 Villeneuve uses the full scene in Advent 

00:01:49.799 --> 00:01:54.029
 Do the same thing. The first scene is a montage depicting Amy Adams 

00:01:54.250 --> 00:02:01.529
 The birth and death of her daughter, the second scene is that Adams came to her school on the day of the aliens. 

00:02:01.630 --> 00:02:06.810
 Because we saw the tragedy in the first scene, and we think that the timeline of the movie is linear 

00:02:06.840 --> 00:02:09.820
 So we interpret Adams’s indifference here as 

00:02:10.480 --> 00:02:15.240
 Frustrated, her boring appearance is expressing her deep sadness and heartache. 

00:02:15.240 --> 00:02:20.760
 It wasn’t until we watched the film that we knew that the opening montage of the movie happened after the film event. 

00:02:21.040 --> 00:02:28.360
 Adams, who we understand in the second act, is just a blank canvas that is given meaning by us. 

00:02:28.720 --> 00:02:36.280
 "Montage means by moving the combined movie clips quickly in front of your eyes. 

00:02:37.240 --> 00:02:43.260
 To create an idea." The difference between Villeneuve and other directors is that he can 

00:02:43.390 --> 00:02:51.089
 Inspire with film, then blend these ideas on another level, collide and fuse them to create higher 

00:02:51.220 --> 00:02:52.660
 significance. 

00:02:52.660 --> 00:02:59.399
 So, what is the significance of Villeneuve's experiment using the Kurishov effect? Maybe it means the future 

00:02:59.590 --> 00:03:01.180
 Influence the past? 

00:03:01.180 --> 00:03:04.500
 After you read this movie, the conclusion is quite 

00:03:04.569 --> 00:03:10.949
 Reasonable, in fact, the key to reaching the climax of this film is when Adams learned 

00:03:10.950 --> 00:03:16.019
 Aliens are high-dimensional lives, they can see all the time at the same time, 

00:03:16.269 --> 00:03:21.689
 She uses this ability to explore the future and influence her. "I called you, are you?" 

00:03:23.530 --> 00:03:30.299
 "Yes, you played." But you can also read another meaning from the same experience, that is, communication. 

00:03:30.850 --> 00:03:32.170
 limited by 

00:03:32.170 --> 00:03:38.759
 Perspective. From our point of view, at the beginning of the movie, everything tells us that Adams is sad, until later 

00:03:38.760 --> 00:03:45.269
 We only know that it is not true. This is another theme of Advent in the exploration of the entire film - 

00:03:46.120 --> 00:03:50.009
 The limitations of human communication have been strengthened and expanded, and we rely on it. 

00:03:50.380 --> 00:03:56.399
 The physiological limitations of our own sensory feedback, our culture and our own personality imposed on us 

00:03:56.829 --> 00:03:58.829
 limitation. "Believe me, you can 

00:03:59.380 --> 00:04:00.910
 Understanding communication 

00:04:00.910 --> 00:04:07.769
 And in the end, it’s still single. When talking to aliens, communication is actually imagined as a screen, a vague intention 

00:04:08.110 --> 00:04:15.119
 Intermediary. Today, the screen can connect with us, we can also divide us, and the same is true for communication. Communication is a kind 

00:04:15.459 --> 00:04:17.100
 The link between the two parties, 

00:04:17.100 --> 00:04:24.749
 But it is usually a connection that speeds up separation. "Language is the foundation of civilization and the glue that brings people together. 

00:04:25.180 --> 00:04:31.079
 It was also the first weapon to be revealed in a conflict. "We are falling asleep on the wheel, you know what I am talking about." 

00:04:31.080 --> 00:04:34.530
 I know that you know. The key here is not that the two interpretations are 

00:04:34.600 --> 00:04:41.729
 Effective, but both interpretations echoed in other parts of the film, and the topics that were introduced were not 

00:04:41.830 --> 00:04:44.340
 waste. The language of the aliens is round, 

00:04:44.340 --> 00:04:51.299
 This movie is also. The difficulty of cooperation between small groups in the Montana camp reflects the cooperation between countries. 

00:04:51.700 --> 00:04:59.189
 difficult. Louise's understanding of her movement in time is nonlinear in the audience's awareness of the described event. 

00:04:59.650 --> 00:05:01.650
 At the same time. "Non-zero and game?" 

00:05:02.020 --> 00:05:06.389
 Each theme is gradually spread through other moments, characters and other themes. 

00:05:06.580 --> 00:05:12.270
 The theme until it starts to feel like something solid, you start thinking about the relationship between language and time 

00:05:12.910 --> 00:05:14.590
 What is it. 

00:05:14.590 --> 00:05:21.840
 Maybe because the mind is not a thing, but a process, the language takes place in time, just like a movie is 

00:05:22.380 --> 00:05:24.720
 An exchange of time occurs. [Russian] 

00:05:24.760 --> 00:05:30.100
 No other art form can be fixed at a fixed time like a movie. 

00:05:30.740 --> 00:05:36.900
 However, what is a movie? It is a mosaic made with time. 

00:05:36.900 --> 00:05:40.680
 Therefore, "Advent" seems to be about the meaning of the film. 

00:05:40.960 --> 00:05:47.250
 possibility. What is it? Where does it come from? I think Villeneuve imagines it as an alien spaceship: 

00:05:47.889 --> 00:05:54.809
 Mysterious, vague, a kind of expression that is not like written or spoken language, so it is difficult to decipher. 

00:05:55.450 --> 00:06:01.379
 Some boring techniques, characters, and stories are always in the movies. 

00:06:01.380 --> 00:06:06.029
 Always on the background, from different angles, can't avoid 

00:06:06.520 --> 00:06:11.010
 "Advent" is not just a denial of bad film, but an example 

00:06:11.560 --> 00:06:16.709
 I think this is also an exploration of "what makes the film great". 

00:06:16.710 --> 00:06:23.519
 It explores from a unique perspective, a movie can be a gift to fans, just like the same language 

00:06:24.040 --> 00:06:29.579
 Can be a gift from an alien, this perspective allows us to see what kind of 

00:06:30.280 --> 00:06:32.280
 A new world. 

00:06:40.909 --> 00:06:47.438
