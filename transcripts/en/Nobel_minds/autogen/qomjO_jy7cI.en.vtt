invention and as we said in the

00:01:00.040 --> 00:01:00.050
invention and as we said in the
 

00:01:00.050 --> 00:01:01.900
invention and as we said in the
announcement these are two achievements

00:01:01.900 --> 00:01:01.910
announcement these are two achievements
 

00:01:01.910 --> 00:01:04.389
announcement these are two achievements
that of affect our everyday lives they

00:01:04.389 --> 00:01:04.399
that of affect our everyday lives they
 

00:01:04.399 --> 00:01:05.560
that of affect our everyday lives they
affect the way that it communicates

00:01:05.560 --> 00:01:05.570
affect the way that it communicates
 

00:01:05.570 --> 00:01:07.780
affect the way that it communicates
everyday and in facts the reason why we

00:01:07.780 --> 00:01:07.790
everyday and in facts the reason why we
 

00:01:07.790 --> 00:01:09.280
everyday and in facts the reason why we
can broadcast this announcement live

around the world is down to these

00:01:10.959 --> 00:01:10.969
around the world is down to these
 

00:01:10.969 --> 00:01:12.459
around the world is down to these
achievements could you say a bit more

00:01:12.459 --> 00:01:12.469
achievements could you say a bit more
 

00:01:12.469 --> 00:01:14.260
achievements could you say a bit more
about that the practical achievements

00:01:14.260 --> 00:01:14.270
about that the practical achievements
 

00:01:14.270 --> 00:01:16.149
about that the practical achievements
that we're discussing towards this

00:01:16.149 --> 00:01:16.159
that we're discussing towards this
 

00:01:16.159 --> 00:01:19.120
that we're discussing towards this
producer price well the the practical

00:01:19.120 --> 00:01:19.130
producer price well the the practical
 

00:01:19.130 --> 00:01:21.279
producer price well the the practical
achievements are enormous I mean if you

00:01:21.279 --> 00:01:21.289
achievements are enormous I mean if you
 

00:01:21.289 --> 00:01:23.709
achievements are enormous I mean if you
start with a with an optical fiber for

00:01:23.709 --> 00:01:23.719
start with a with an optical fiber for
 

00:01:23.719 --> 00:01:26.620
start with a with an optical fiber for
telecommunication there was an awareness

00:01:26.620 --> 00:01:26.630
telecommunication there was an awareness
 

00:01:26.630 --> 00:01:29.260
telecommunication there was an awareness
of the potential of optical

00:01:29.260 --> 00:01:29.270
of the potential of optical
 

00:01:29.270 --> 00:01:32.889
of the potential of optical
communication in more than 50 years ago

00:01:32.889 --> 00:01:32.899
communication in more than 50 years ago
 

00:01:32.899 --> 00:01:36.010
communication in more than 50 years ago
but it was not possible because the

00:01:36.010 --> 00:01:36.020
but it was not possible because the
 

00:01:36.020 --> 00:01:39.099
but it was not possible because the
fibers that were available didn't work I

00:01:39.099 --> 00:01:39.109
fibers that were available didn't work I
 

00:01:39.109 --> 00:01:41.589
fibers that were available didn't work I
mean after 20 meters most of the light

00:01:41.589 --> 00:01:41.599
mean after 20 meters most of the light
 

00:01:41.599 --> 00:01:44.709
mean after 20 meters most of the light
was was gone and to solve these problems

00:01:44.709 --> 00:01:44.719
was was gone and to solve these problems
 

00:01:44.719 --> 00:01:48.879
was was gone and to solve these problems
that was the key work of how that made

00:01:48.879 --> 00:01:48.889
that was the key work of how that made
 

00:01:48.889 --> 00:01:51.190
that was the key work of how that made
all these things happen he was able to

00:01:51.190 --> 00:01:51.200
all these things happen he was able to
 

00:01:51.200 --> 00:01:53.319
all these things happen he was able to
identify what the problem was

00:01:53.319 --> 00:01:53.329
identify what the problem was
 

00:01:53.329 --> 00:01:55.949
identify what the problem was
really and devise a pathway to a

00:01:55.949 --> 00:01:55.959
really and devise a pathway to a
 

00:01:55.959 --> 00:01:58.569
really and devise a pathway to a
successful fabrication of the fibers

00:01:58.569 --> 00:01:58.579
successful fabrication of the fibers
 

00:01:58.579 --> 00:02:00.279
successful fabrication of the fibers
that eventually led to what we have

00:02:00.279 --> 00:02:00.289
that eventually led to what we have
 

00:02:00.289 --> 00:02:04.539
that eventually led to what we have
today and now I think it's more than a

00:02:04.539 --> 00:02:04.549
today and now I think it's more than a
 

00:02:04.549 --> 00:02:07.389
today and now I think it's more than a
billions of kilometers of fibers around

00:02:07.389 --> 00:02:07.399
billions of kilometers of fibers around
 

00:02:07.399 --> 00:02:09.490
billions of kilometers of fibers around
the world that connects us all almost

00:02:09.490 --> 00:02:09.500
the world that connects us all almost
 

00:02:09.500 --> 00:02:13.840
the world that connects us all almost
instantly and this is due to the work of

00:02:13.840 --> 00:02:13.850
instantly and this is due to the work of
 

00:02:13.850 --> 00:02:16.120
instantly and this is due to the work of
how the work that inspired and started

00:02:16.120 --> 00:02:16.130
how the work that inspired and started
 

00:02:16.130 --> 00:02:17.800
how the work that inspired and started
the

00:02:17.800 --> 00:02:17.810
the
 

00:02:17.810 --> 00:02:21.350
the
evolution of optical communication that

00:02:21.350 --> 00:02:21.360
evolution of optical communication that
 

00:02:21.360 --> 00:02:25.430
evolution of optical communication that
we had today the other yeah the other

00:02:25.430 --> 00:02:25.440
we had today the other yeah the other
 

00:02:25.440 --> 00:02:29.000
we had today the other yeah the other
part to record images directly

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:29.010
part to record images directly
 

00:02:29.010 --> 00:02:31.640
part to record images directly
electronically I mean we had of course

00:02:31.640 --> 00:02:31.650
electronically I mean we had of course
 

00:02:31.650 --> 00:02:34.840
electronically I mean we had of course
TV cameras the vidicon type of camera

00:02:34.840 --> 00:02:34.850
TV cameras the vidicon type of camera
 

00:02:34.850 --> 00:02:38.900
TV cameras the vidicon type of camera
when when Boyle and Smith did their work

00:02:38.900 --> 00:02:38.910
when when Boyle and Smith did their work
 

00:02:38.910 --> 00:02:41.840
when when Boyle and Smith did their work
and actually they were not primarily

00:02:41.840 --> 00:02:41.850
and actually they were not primarily
 

00:02:41.850 --> 00:02:45.920
and actually they were not primarily
after a sensor to record images they

00:02:45.920 --> 00:02:45.930
after a sensor to record images they
 

00:02:45.930 --> 00:02:51.160
after a sensor to record images they
were inspired or or pushed almost by

00:02:51.160 --> 00:02:51.170
were inspired or or pushed almost by
 

00:02:51.170 --> 00:02:53.660
were inspired or or pushed almost by
competing activities in the lab because

00:02:53.660 --> 00:02:53.670
competing activities in the lab because
 

00:02:53.670 --> 00:02:56.510
competing activities in the lab because
at Bell Labs the bubble memory the

00:02:56.510 --> 00:02:56.520
at Bell Labs the bubble memory the
 

00:02:56.520 --> 00:02:58.040
at Bell Labs the bubble memory the
magnetic bubble memory was something

00:02:58.040 --> 00:02:58.050
magnetic bubble memory was something
 

00:02:58.050 --> 00:02:59.600
magnetic bubble memory was something
that people worked on and it would be

00:02:59.600 --> 00:02:59.610
that people worked on and it would be
 

00:02:59.610 --> 00:03:03.020
that people worked on and it would be
very important and somehow I think Boyle

00:03:03.020 --> 00:03:03.030
very important and somehow I think Boyle
 

00:03:03.030 --> 00:03:06.620
very important and somehow I think Boyle
and Smith felt a little bit pressed to

00:03:06.620 --> 00:03:06.630
and Smith felt a little bit pressed to
 

00:03:06.630 --> 00:03:08.240
and Smith felt a little bit pressed to
come up with some things I could compete

00:03:08.240 --> 00:03:08.250
come up with some things I could compete
 

00:03:08.250 --> 00:03:11.780
come up with some things I could compete
that could could offer something in with

00:03:11.780 --> 00:03:11.790
that could could offer something in with
 

00:03:11.790 --> 00:03:13.070
that could could offer something in with
respect or memories so they were

00:03:13.070 --> 00:03:13.080
respect or memories so they were
 

00:03:13.080 --> 00:03:15.380
respect or memories so they were
actually trying to invent a new type of

00:03:15.380 --> 00:03:15.390
actually trying to invent a new type of
 

00:03:15.390 --> 00:03:18.949
actually trying to invent a new type of
memory but in doing that they soon

00:03:18.949 --> 00:03:18.959
memory but in doing that they soon
 

00:03:18.959 --> 00:03:21.470
memory but in doing that they soon
realized that they had an image sensor

00:03:21.470 --> 00:03:21.480
realized that they had an image sensor
 

00:03:21.480 --> 00:03:25.790
realized that they had an image sensor
that worked perfectly well and this is

00:03:25.790 --> 00:03:25.800
that worked perfectly well and this is
 

00:03:25.800 --> 00:03:27.500
that worked perfectly well and this is
the form of a image technology that we

00:03:27.500 --> 00:03:27.510
the form of a image technology that we
 

00:03:27.510 --> 00:03:31.130
the form of a image technology that we
see in everyday digital cameras well not

00:03:31.130 --> 00:03:31.140
see in everyday digital cameras well not
 

00:03:31.140 --> 00:03:33.670
see in everyday digital cameras well not
every day digital cameras because in

00:03:33.670 --> 00:03:33.680
every day digital cameras because in
 

00:03:33.680 --> 00:03:36.250
every day digital cameras because in
telephones for instance those cameras

00:03:36.250 --> 00:03:36.260
telephones for instance those cameras
 

00:03:36.260 --> 00:03:39.229
telephones for instance those cameras
are typically another technique but in a

00:03:39.229 --> 00:03:39.239
are typically another technique but in a
 

00:03:39.239 --> 00:03:42.440
are typically another technique but in a
really high-end cameras where resolution

00:03:42.440 --> 00:03:42.450
really high-end cameras where resolution
 

00:03:42.450 --> 00:03:45.220
really high-end cameras where resolution
and sensitivity are really very high

00:03:45.220 --> 00:03:45.230
and sensitivity are really very high
 

00:03:45.230 --> 00:03:49.970
and sensitivity are really very high
then you'll find the cccd technique so

00:03:49.970 --> 00:03:49.980
then you'll find the cccd technique so
 

00:03:49.980 --> 00:03:53.710
then you'll find the cccd technique so
the prize is rewarding the the use of

is images which was an invention created
by Boyle and Smith yes it's in in this

00:04:06.800 --> 00:04:06.810
by Boyle and Smith yes it's in in this
 

00:04:06.810 --> 00:04:09.650
by Boyle and Smith yes it's in in this
case it is really an invention and the

00:04:09.650 --> 00:04:09.660
case it is really an invention and the
 

00:04:09.660 --> 00:04:11.870
case it is really an invention and the
idea they come up with the idea and

00:04:11.870 --> 00:04:11.880
idea they come up with the idea and
 

00:04:11.880 --> 00:04:14.240
idea they come up with the idea and
sketched it and come to a more or less

you said that the fiber optics are

00:04:49.149 --> 00:04:49.159
you said that the fiber optics are
 

00:04:49.159 --> 00:04:51.099
you said that the fiber optics are
already in use but they're they they

00:04:51.099 --> 00:04:51.109
already in use but they're they they
 

00:04:51.109 --> 00:04:52.479
already in use but they're they they
weren't great at transmitting light

was wrong with these fibers spent a few
 

00:05:01.879 --> 00:05:03.489
was wrong with these fibers spent a few
years work on this and came up with with

00:05:03.489 --> 00:05:03.499
years work on this and came up with with
 

00:05:03.499 --> 00:05:06.099
years work on this and came up with with
a paper in 1966 to propose what he

00:05:06.099 --> 00:05:06.109
a paper in 1966 to propose what he
 

00:05:06.109 --> 00:05:07.959
a paper in 1966 to propose what he
thought was was was wrong with these

Gothic fibers how to improve their
 

00:05:09.499 --> 00:05:11.679
Gothic fibers how to improve their
quality could you discuss a little bit

00:05:11.679 --> 00:05:11.689
quality could you discuss a little bit
 

00:05:11.689 --> 00:05:13.539
quality could you discuss a little bit
about what findings he came up with and

00:05:13.539 --> 00:05:13.549
about what findings he came up with and
 

00:05:13.549 --> 00:05:16.149
about what findings he came up with and
how they were actually realized well the

00:05:16.149 --> 00:05:16.159
how they were actually realized well the
 

00:05:16.159 --> 00:05:19.359
how they were actually realized well the
main thing was that he realized that

00:05:19.359 --> 00:05:19.369
main thing was that he realized that
 

00:05:19.369 --> 00:05:22.059
main thing was that he realized that
there were impurities even though they

00:05:22.059 --> 00:05:22.069
there were impurities even though they
 

00:05:22.069 --> 00:05:23.739
there were impurities even though they
thought they had very clean glass it was

00:05:23.739 --> 00:05:23.749
thought they had very clean glass it was
 

00:05:23.749 --> 00:05:26.609
thought they had very clean glass it was
impurities that impeded the the

00:05:26.609 --> 00:05:26.619
impurities that impeded the the
 

00:05:26.619 --> 00:05:29.259
impurities that impeded the the
transmission and to get rid of because

00:05:29.259 --> 00:05:29.269
transmission and to get rid of because
 

00:05:29.269 --> 00:05:31.179

he could he made theoretical

00:05:31.179 --> 00:05:31.189
he could he made theoretical
 

00:05:31.189 --> 00:05:33.219
he could he made theoretical
calculations the studies and he came to

00:05:33.219 --> 00:05:33.229
calculations the studies and he came to
 

00:05:33.229 --> 00:05:34.959
calculations the studies and he came to
the conclusion that it should be much

00:05:34.959 --> 00:05:34.969
the conclusion that it should be much
 

00:05:34.969 --> 00:05:39.209
the conclusion that it should be much
better than it was experimentally and

00:05:39.209 --> 00:05:39.219
better than it was experimentally and
 

00:05:39.219 --> 00:05:42.299
better than it was experimentally and
also he studied what would be the the

00:05:42.299 --> 00:05:42.309
also he studied what would be the the
 

00:05:42.309 --> 00:05:44.499
also he studied what would be the the
showstopper so they're limiting factors

00:05:44.499 --> 00:05:44.509
showstopper so they're limiting factors
 

00:05:44.509 --> 00:05:47.859
showstopper so they're limiting factors
the real showstopper was impurities but

00:05:47.859 --> 00:05:47.869
the real showstopper was impurities but
 

00:05:47.869 --> 00:05:49.689
the real showstopper was impurities but
also the other limiting factors is

00:05:49.689 --> 00:05:49.699
also the other limiting factors is
 

00:05:49.699 --> 00:05:53.379
also the other limiting factors is
scattering and excitation in the fiber

00:05:53.379 --> 00:05:53.389
scattering and excitation in the fiber
 

00:05:53.389 --> 00:05:56.679
scattering and excitation in the fiber
of the atomic motion and and so on they

00:05:56.679 --> 00:05:56.689
of the atomic motion and and so on they
 

00:05:56.689 --> 00:05:58.059
of the atomic motion and and so on they
are the things that set their limit

00:05:58.059 --> 00:05:58.069
are the things that set their limit
 

00:05:58.069 --> 00:06:02.499
are the things that set their limit
eventually but to get ultra pure fibers

00:06:02.499 --> 00:06:02.509
eventually but to get ultra pure fibers
 

00:06:02.509 --> 00:06:04.479
eventually but to get ultra pure fibers
and that was also quite some undertaking

00:06:04.479 --> 00:06:04.489
and that was also quite some undertaking
 

00:06:04.489 --> 00:06:06.459
and that was also quite some undertaking
to do that I mean that were others like

00:06:06.459 --> 00:06:06.469
to do that I mean that were others like
 

00:06:06.469 --> 00:06:09.789
to do that I mean that were others like
Corning Glass that were able after four

00:06:09.789 --> 00:06:09.799
Corning Glass that were able after four
 

00:06:09.799 --> 00:06:12.729
Corning Glass that were able after four
years to fabricate such fibers and they

00:06:12.729 --> 00:06:12.739
years to fabricate such fibers and they
 

00:06:12.739 --> 00:06:14.649
years to fabricate such fibers and they
were very advanced chemical methods that

00:06:14.649 --> 00:06:14.659
were very advanced chemical methods that
 

00:06:14.659 --> 00:06:17.409
were very advanced chemical methods that
they had to develop and employ in order

00:06:17.409 --> 00:06:17.419
they had to develop and employ in order
 

00:06:17.419 --> 00:06:21.069
they had to develop and employ in order
to do that so that was also substantial

00:06:21.069 --> 00:06:21.079
to do that so that was also substantial
 

00:06:21.079 --> 00:06:23.259
to do that so that was also substantial
and an important work that was done by

00:06:23.259 --> 00:06:23.269
and an important work that was done by
 

00:06:23.269 --> 00:06:26.769
and an important work that was done by
these glass companies so improving the

00:06:26.769 --> 00:06:26.779
these glass companies so improving the
 

00:06:26.779 --> 00:06:28.509
these glass companies so improving the
quality of the glass that's or in cases

00:06:28.509 --> 00:06:28.519
quality of the glass that's or in cases
 

00:06:28.519 --> 00:06:30.099
quality of the glass that's or in cases
these fiber optics and allowed better

00:06:30.099 --> 00:06:30.109
these fiber optics and allowed better
 

00:06:30.109 --> 00:06:31.689
these fiber optics and allowed better
performance allowed less light to be

00:06:31.689 --> 00:06:31.699
performance allowed less light to be
 

00:06:31.699 --> 00:06:33.639
performance allowed less light to be
lost as you transmit the signal through

00:06:33.639 --> 00:06:33.649
lost as you transmit the signal through
 

00:06:33.649 --> 00:06:36.129
lost as you transmit the signal through
them what was then possible once these

00:06:36.129 --> 00:06:36.139

well the cow had set up a target and

00:06:44.660 --> 00:06:44.670
well the cow had set up a target and
 

00:06:44.670 --> 00:06:48.710
well the cow had set up a target and
that he thought would be enough to make

00:06:48.710 --> 00:06:48.720
that he thought would be enough to make
 

00:06:48.720 --> 00:06:51.170
that he thought would be enough to make
communication feasible but the companies

00:06:51.170 --> 00:06:51.180
communication feasible but the companies
 

00:06:51.180 --> 00:06:53.810
communication feasible but the companies
they after four years were able to beat

00:06:53.810 --> 00:06:53.820
they after four years were able to beat
 

00:06:53.820 --> 00:06:56.720
they after four years were able to beat
that target and even go much further but

00:06:56.720 --> 00:06:56.730
that target and even go much further but
 

00:06:56.730 --> 00:06:59.180
that target and even go much further but
today of course when the fibers

00:06:59.180 --> 00:06:59.190
today of course when the fibers
 

00:06:59.190 --> 00:07:01.910
today of course when the fibers
themselves have something like 95% of

00:07:01.910 --> 00:07:01.920
themselves have something like 95% of
 

00:07:01.920 --> 00:07:03.140
themselves have something like 95% of
the light is still there after one

00:07:03.140 --> 00:07:03.150
the light is still there after one
 

00:07:03.150 --> 00:07:05.660
the light is still there after one
kilometer but of course if you want to

00:07:05.660 --> 00:07:05.670
kilometer but of course if you want to
 

00:07:05.670 --> 00:07:08.990
kilometer but of course if you want to
communicate between continents you still

00:07:08.990 --> 00:07:09.000
communicate between continents you still
 

00:07:09.000 --> 00:07:11.420
communicate between continents you still
lose quite a lot so in today's network

00:07:11.420 --> 00:07:11.430
lose quite a lot so in today's network
 

00:07:11.430 --> 00:07:13.610
lose quite a lot so in today's network
fibre network there is also integrated

00:07:13.610 --> 00:07:13.620
fibre network there is also integrated
 

00:07:13.620 --> 00:07:17.000
fibre network there is also integrated
lasers you can make a laser in a fiber

00:07:17.000 --> 00:07:17.010
lasers you can make a laser in a fiber
 

00:07:17.010 --> 00:07:19.310
lasers you can make a laser in a fiber
so part of the fiber is a laser that

00:07:19.310 --> 00:07:19.320
so part of the fiber is a laser that
 

00:07:19.320 --> 00:07:21.260
so part of the fiber is a laser that
amplifies so you have a number of those

00:07:21.260 --> 00:07:21.270
amplifies so you have a number of those
 

00:07:21.270 --> 00:07:23.630
amplifies so you have a number of those
amplification stages also that are used

00:07:23.630 --> 00:07:23.640
amplification stages also that are used
 

00:07:23.640 --> 00:07:26.000
amplification stages also that are used
in today's fiber networks and so what is

00:07:26.000 --> 00:07:26.010
in today's fiber networks and so what is
 

00:07:26.010 --> 00:07:27.560
in today's fiber networks and so what is
it possible to achieve now with with

00:07:27.560 --> 00:07:27.570
it possible to achieve now with with
 

00:07:27.570 --> 00:07:31.070
it possible to achieve now with with
fiber optic technology well you can

00:07:31.070 --> 00:07:31.080
fiber optic technology well you can
 

00:07:31.080 --> 00:07:34.550
fiber optic technology well you can
communicate the terabit per second range

00:07:34.550 --> 00:07:34.560
communicate the terabit per second range
 

00:07:34.560 --> 00:07:37.220
communicate the terabit per second range
and you can have tens of thousands and

00:07:37.220 --> 00:07:37.230
and you can have tens of thousands and
 

00:07:37.230 --> 00:07:40.040
and you can have tens of thousands and
thousands of telephone calls in the same

00:07:40.040 --> 00:07:40.050
thousands of telephone calls in the same
 

00:07:40.050 --> 00:07:42.680
thousands of telephone calls in the same
fiber and then sort of the the capacity

00:07:42.680 --> 00:07:42.690

of the transferring information is

00:07:44.360 --> 00:07:44.370
of the transferring information is
 

00:07:44.370 --> 00:07:49.790
of the transferring information is
enormous and and it's still it's still

00:07:49.790 --> 00:07:49.800
enormous and and it's still it's still

mean they had a somewhat different focus

00:11:09.440 --> 00:11:09.450
mean they had a somewhat different focus
 

00:11:09.450 --> 00:11:11.960
mean they had a somewhat different focus
what they wanted to accomplish and then

00:11:11.960 --> 00:11:11.970
what they wanted to accomplish and then
 

00:11:11.970 --> 00:11:13.730
what they wanted to accomplish and then
they soon realized it could you be used

time they had a lot of resources they

00:11:25.670 --> 00:11:25.680
time they had a lot of resources they
 

00:11:25.680 --> 00:11:27.650
time they had a lot of resources they
had an environment which was very

00:11:27.650 --> 00:11:27.660
had an environment which was very
 

00:11:27.660 --> 00:11:29.720
had an environment which was very
productive and creative and they can

00:11:29.720 --> 00:11:29.730
productive and creative and they can
 

00:11:29.730 --> 00:11:32.360
productive and creative and they can
sort of do what they wanted and there's

00:11:32.360 --> 00:11:32.370
sort of do what they wanted and there's
 

00:11:32.370 --> 00:11:34.610
sort of do what they wanted and there's
so much that came out of this lab and

00:11:34.610 --> 00:11:34.620
so much that came out of this lab and
 

00:11:34.620 --> 00:11:37.030
so much that came out of this lab and
other labs who had that kind of

00:11:37.030 --> 00:11:37.040
other labs who had that kind of
 

00:11:37.040 --> 00:11:40.060
other labs who had that kind of
possibilities unfortunately I would say

00:11:40.060 --> 00:11:40.070
possibilities unfortunately I would say
 

00:11:40.070 --> 00:11:44.720
possibilities unfortunately I would say
into the 80s or so several of those lab

00:11:44.720 --> 00:11:44.730
into the 80s or so several of those lab
 

00:11:44.730 --> 00:11:46.940
into the 80s or so several of those lab
these American labs from but the big

00:11:46.940 --> 00:11:46.950
these American labs from but the big
 

00:11:46.950 --> 00:11:49.040
these American labs from but the big
companies had like Bell and Exxon and

00:11:49.040 --> 00:11:49.050
companies had like Bell and Exxon and
 

00:11:49.050 --> 00:11:52.520
companies had like Bell and Exxon and
and IBM and others they abandoned some

00:11:52.520 --> 00:11:52.530
and IBM and others they abandoned some
 

00:11:52.530 --> 00:11:56.720

of this these ideas to have a fairly

00:11:56.720 --> 00:11:56.730
of this these ideas to have a fairly
 

00:11:56.730 --> 00:12:00.470
of this these ideas to have a fairly
free possibility for scientists to work

00:12:00.470 --> 00:12:00.480
free possibility for scientists to work
 

00:12:00.480 --> 00:12:02.540
free possibility for scientists to work
on their problems and that's a pity I

00:12:02.540 --> 00:12:02.550
on their problems and that's a pity I
 

00:12:02.550 --> 00:12:04.760
on their problems and that's a pity I
think and of course Bell Labs is no

00:12:04.760 --> 00:12:04.770
think and of course Bell Labs is no
 

00:12:04.770 --> 00:12:07.610
think and of course Bell Labs is no
longer with us but is it is the idea is

00:12:07.610 --> 00:12:07.620
longer with us but is it is the idea is
 

00:12:07.620 --> 00:12:08.990
longer with us but is it is the idea is
the concept of the way that these ideas

00:12:08.990 --> 00:12:09.000
the concept of the way that these ideas
 

00:12:09.000 --> 00:12:10.870
the concept of the way that these ideas
come about something that the Academy

00:12:10.870 --> 00:12:10.880
come about something that the Academy
 

00:12:10.880 --> 00:12:13.280
come about something that the Academy
really wants promoting in terms of its

I mean it is the scientific environment

00:12:19.370 --> 00:12:19.380
I mean it is the scientific environment
 

00:12:19.380 --> 00:12:23.690
I mean it is the scientific environment
where students researchers work is is

00:12:23.690 --> 00:12:23.700
where students researchers work is is
 

00:12:23.700 --> 00:12:25.760
where students researchers work is is
almost everything I mean of course it

00:12:25.760 --> 00:12:25.770
almost everything I mean of course it
 

00:12:25.770 --> 00:12:27.020
almost everything I mean of course it
has to be based on good and your

price Shadwell between two is so evident
 

00:14:02.110 --> 00:14:04.500
price Shadwell between two is so evident
for everyone I mean the way we are

00:14:04.500 --> 00:14:04.510
for everyone I mean the way we are
 

00:14:04.510 --> 00:14:06.420
for everyone I mean the way we are
connected today the way the

connected today the way the
communication works the way we

00:14:09.650 --> 00:14:09.660
communication works the way we
 

00:14:09.660 --> 00:14:14.540
communication works the way we
can image things that happen and we can

00:14:14.540 --> 00:14:14.550
can image things that happen and we can
 

00:14:14.550 --> 00:14:16.939
can image things that happen and we can
transmit easily I mean it is so evident

00:14:16.939 --> 00:14:16.949
transmit easily I mean it is so evident
 

00:14:16.949 --> 00:14:19.509
transmit easily I mean it is so evident
and that was not evident 20 years ago

00:14:19.509 --> 00:14:19.519
and that was not evident 20 years ago
 

00:14:19.519 --> 00:14:22.879
and that was not evident 20 years ago
and in terms of the the way the prize is

00:14:22.879 --> 00:14:22.889
and in terms of the the way the prize is
 

00:14:22.889 --> 00:14:24.499
and in terms of the the way the prize is
shared is it straightforward decision to

00:14:24.499 --> 00:14:24.509
shared is it straightforward decision to
 

00:14:24.509 --> 00:14:26.960
shared is it straightforward decision to
award half the prize to each of these

00:14:26.960 --> 00:14:26.970
award half the prize to each of these
 

00:14:26.970 --> 00:14:30.410
award half the prize to each of these
subjects well you can choose under there

00:14:30.410 --> 00:14:30.420
subjects well you can choose under there
 

00:14:30.420 --> 00:14:34.160
subjects well you can choose under there
again the statute allows you to share

00:14:34.160 --> 00:14:34.170
again the statute allows you to share
 

00:14:34.170 --> 00:14:37.999
again the statute allows you to share
the price or to divide it into two to

00:14:37.999 --> 00:14:38.009
the price or to divide it into two to
 

00:14:38.009 --> 00:14:40.660
the price or to divide it into two to
two parts and we thought that it was a

00:14:40.660 --> 00:14:40.670
two parts and we thought that it was a
 

00:14:40.670 --> 00:14:43.370
two parts and we thought that it was a
good combination I mean they are linked

00:14:43.370 --> 00:14:43.380
good combination I mean they are linked
 

00:14:43.380 --> 00:14:44.749
good combination I mean they are linked
to their different distinctly different

00:14:44.749 --> 00:14:44.759
to their different distinctly different
 

00:14:44.759 --> 00:14:46.639
to their different distinctly different
but they are linked to each other and it

00:14:46.639 --> 00:14:46.649
but they are linked to each other and it
 

00:14:46.649 --> 00:14:49.129
but they are linked to each other and it
was we're very happy that we could do it

00:14:49.129 --> 00:14:49.139
was we're very happy that we could do it
 

00:14:49.139 --> 00:14:51.980
was we're very happy that we could do it
