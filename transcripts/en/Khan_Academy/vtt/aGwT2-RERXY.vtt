00:00:00.374 --> 00:00:01.790
What I want to do
in this video is

00:00:01.790 --> 00:00:04.692
to show that if we start
with any arbitrary triangle--

00:00:04.692 --> 00:00:07.150
and this will be the arbitrary
triangle that we're starting

00:00:07.150 --> 00:00:10.010
with-- that we can
always make this

00:00:10.010 --> 00:00:13.265
the medial triangle
of a larger triangle.

00:00:13.265 --> 00:00:15.090
And when we say the
medial triangle,

00:00:15.090 --> 00:00:18.410
we mean that each of the
vertices of this triangle

00:00:18.410 --> 00:00:21.887
will be the midpoint of the
sides of a larger triangle.

00:00:21.887 --> 00:00:24.220
And I wanted to show that you
can always construct that.

00:00:24.220 --> 00:00:25.730
If you start with
this triangle, you

00:00:25.730 --> 00:00:29.360
can always have this be the
medial triangle of a larger

00:00:29.360 --> 00:00:30.380
triangle.

00:00:30.380 --> 00:00:33.560
So to do that, let's
draw a line that

00:00:33.560 --> 00:00:35.870
goes through this
point right over here,

00:00:35.870 --> 00:00:39.010
but that's parallel to
this line down here.

00:00:39.010 --> 00:00:44.470
So this line and this line up
here are going to be parallel.

00:00:44.470 --> 00:00:46.302
So just like that.

00:00:46.302 --> 00:00:47.760
And immediately we
can start to say

00:00:47.760 --> 00:00:49.940
some interesting things
about the angles.

00:00:49.940 --> 00:00:53.082
So if we have a transversal
right over here,

00:00:53.082 --> 00:00:55.290
we could view this side as
a transversal of these two

00:00:55.290 --> 00:00:58.160
parallel lines, or of
this line in the segment.

00:00:58.160 --> 00:01:01.310
We know that alternate
interior angles are congruent.

00:01:01.310 --> 00:01:04.250
So that angle is going to
be congruent to that angle.

00:01:04.250 --> 00:01:07.030
And we also know that
this angle in blue,

00:01:07.030 --> 00:01:10.760
is going to be congruent to
that angle right over there.

00:01:10.760 --> 00:01:12.910
Now, let's do that for
the other two sides.

00:01:12.910 --> 00:01:16.710
So let's create a
line that is parallel

00:01:16.710 --> 00:01:19.020
to this side of the
triangle, but that

00:01:19.020 --> 00:01:22.090
goes through this
point right over here.

00:01:22.090 --> 00:01:27.090
So let me draw it
as well as possible.

00:01:27.090 --> 00:01:29.432
And so these two characters
are going to be parallel,

00:01:29.432 --> 00:01:31.640
and you could always construct
a line that's parallel

00:01:31.640 --> 00:01:35.510
to another line that goes to a
point that's not on that line.

00:01:35.510 --> 00:01:39.240
And so once again, we can use
alternate interior angles.

00:01:39.240 --> 00:01:42.520
We know that if this angle
right over here-- let's

00:01:42.520 --> 00:01:45.940
say we have this orange angle--
it's alternate interior angle

00:01:45.940 --> 00:01:48.640
is this angle right over there.

00:01:48.640 --> 00:01:50.380
We also have
corresponding angles.

00:01:50.380 --> 00:01:55.060
This blue angle corresponds
to this angle right over here.

00:01:55.060 --> 00:01:59.070
So it will correspond to
that angle right over there.

00:01:59.070 --> 00:02:01.870
And now let's draw another
line that is parallel

00:02:01.870 --> 00:02:05.070
to this line right
over here, but it

00:02:05.070 --> 00:02:06.580
goes through this vertex.

00:02:06.580 --> 00:02:09.470
It goes through the vertex
that's opposite that line.

00:02:09.470 --> 00:02:11.650
And so let me just draw it.

00:02:11.650 --> 00:02:15.330
And you can always construct
these parallel lines just

00:02:15.330 --> 00:02:16.360
like that.

00:02:16.360 --> 00:02:17.500
And let's see what happens.

00:02:17.500 --> 00:02:19.333
So once again, these
two lines are parallel.

00:02:19.333 --> 00:02:21.650
So you could view this
green line as a transversal.

00:02:21.650 --> 00:02:23.660
If this green line
is a transversal,

00:02:23.660 --> 00:02:29.420
this corresponding angle is
this angle right over here.

00:02:29.420 --> 00:02:32.510
If we view this green line
as a transversal of both

00:02:32.510 --> 00:02:35.930
of these pink lines,
then this angle

00:02:35.930 --> 00:02:39.470
corresponds to this
angle right over here.

00:02:39.470 --> 00:02:42.970
If we view this yellow line
as a transversal of both

00:02:42.970 --> 00:02:47.080
of these pink lines-- actually,
let's look at it this way.

00:02:47.080 --> 00:02:50.270
View the pink line as a
transversal of these two

00:02:50.270 --> 00:02:53.970
yellow lines, then we know
that this angle corresponds

00:02:53.970 --> 00:02:56.300
to this angle right over here.

00:02:56.300 --> 00:02:59.300
And if you view this yellow line
as a transversal of these two

00:02:59.300 --> 00:03:02.420
pink lines, then this
angle corresponds

00:03:02.420 --> 00:03:06.500
to this angle right over here.

00:03:06.500 --> 00:03:11.390
And then the last thing
we need to think about

00:03:11.390 --> 00:03:18.030
is if we think about the
two green parallel lines

00:03:18.030 --> 00:03:22.470
and you view this yellow
line as a transversal,

00:03:22.470 --> 00:03:27.460
then this corresponding angle
in orange is right over here.

00:03:27.460 --> 00:03:30.800
This corresponds to that
angle, because this yellow line

00:03:30.800 --> 00:03:33.900
is a transversal on both
of these green lines.

00:03:33.900 --> 00:03:37.600
So what I've just shown starting
with this inner triangle

00:03:37.600 --> 00:03:40.740
right over here is that if I
construct these parallel lines

00:03:40.740 --> 00:03:43.934
in this way, that I
now have four triangles

00:03:43.934 --> 00:03:45.850
if I include the original
one, and they're all

00:03:45.850 --> 00:03:47.210
going to be similar
to each other.

00:03:47.210 --> 00:03:48.240
And we know that
they're all similar

00:03:48.240 --> 00:03:50.073
because they all have
the exact same angles.

00:03:50.073 --> 00:03:52.050
You just need two angles
to prove similarity.

00:03:52.050 --> 00:03:55.732
But all four of these triangles
have the exact three angles.

00:03:55.732 --> 00:03:58.190
Now, the other thing we can
show is that they're congruent.

00:03:58.190 --> 00:04:00.260
So all of these
four are similar.

00:04:00.260 --> 00:04:01.780
And we also know
they're congruent.

00:04:01.780 --> 00:04:06.270
For example, this side
right over here in yellow

00:04:06.270 --> 00:04:08.490
is the side in this
triangle, between the orange

00:04:08.490 --> 00:04:11.240
and the green side, is the
side between the orange

00:04:11.240 --> 00:04:13.920
and the green side on this
triangle right over here.

00:04:13.920 --> 00:04:18.720
So these two-- we have an
angle, a side, and an angle.

00:04:18.720 --> 00:04:20.000
Angle-side-angle congruency.

00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:23.430
So these two are going to
be congruent to each other.

00:04:23.430 --> 00:04:26.600
Then over here, on
this inner triangle,

00:04:26.600 --> 00:04:28.230
our original triangle,
the side that's

00:04:28.230 --> 00:04:30.680
between the orange
and the blue side

00:04:30.680 --> 00:04:33.450
is going to be congruent to
the side between the orange

00:04:33.450 --> 00:04:35.400
and the blue side
on that triangle.

00:04:35.400 --> 00:04:37.720
Once again, we have
angle-side-angle congruency.

00:04:37.720 --> 00:04:40.450
So this is congruent to this,
which is congruent to that.

00:04:40.450 --> 00:04:42.920
All of these are
going to be congruent.

00:04:42.920 --> 00:04:49.350
And by the same exact
argument, this middle triangle

00:04:49.350 --> 00:04:52.340
is going to be congruent
to this bottom triangle.

00:04:52.340 --> 00:04:56.690
You have an angle, blue angle,
purple side, green angle.

00:04:56.690 --> 00:04:59.260
Blue angle, purple
side, green angle.

00:04:59.260 --> 00:05:00.960
They're congruent to each other.

00:05:00.960 --> 00:05:02.390
So you have all
of these triangles

00:05:02.390 --> 00:05:04.440
are congruent to each other.

00:05:04.440 --> 00:05:06.980
So their corresponding
sides are equal.

00:05:06.980 --> 00:05:10.400
So if you look at this
triangle over here,

00:05:10.400 --> 00:05:15.540
we know that the side
between the blue angle

00:05:15.540 --> 00:05:19.070
and the green angle
is going to be

00:05:19.070 --> 00:05:21.510
equal to this angle
right over here.

00:05:21.510 --> 00:05:24.032
Sorry, equal to this length.

00:05:24.032 --> 00:05:25.740
So it's going to be
equal to this length.

00:05:25.740 --> 00:05:27.230
Between the blue
and the green we

00:05:27.230 --> 00:05:29.040
have this length, between
the blue and the green

00:05:29.040 --> 00:05:31.290
we have that length, between
the blue and the green we

00:05:31.290 --> 00:05:33.320
have that length
right over there.

00:05:33.320 --> 00:05:35.920
So you immediately see that
this point-- and let me label it

00:05:35.920 --> 00:05:37.900
now, maybe I should've
labeled it before.

00:05:37.900 --> 00:05:39.770
If we call that point
A, we see that A

00:05:39.770 --> 00:05:44.000
is the midpoint of--
let's call this point B,

00:05:44.000 --> 00:05:46.550
and call this point
C right over here.

00:05:46.550 --> 00:05:49.364
So A is the midpoint of BC.

00:05:49.364 --> 00:05:50.280
So that's fair enough.

00:05:50.280 --> 00:05:52.500
So I was able to
construct it in that way.

00:05:52.500 --> 00:05:54.540
Now let's look at
the other sides.

00:05:54.540 --> 00:05:56.990
So this green side
on all the triangles

00:05:56.990 --> 00:06:00.620
is the side between the
blue and the orange angle.

00:06:00.620 --> 00:06:02.560
So between the blue
and the orange angle,

00:06:02.560 --> 00:06:05.450
you have the green side, between
the blue and the orange angle

00:06:05.450 --> 00:06:07.310
you have the green side.

00:06:07.310 --> 00:06:10.250
So once again, this length
is equal to this length.

00:06:10.250 --> 00:06:13.080
And so if we call this
point over here D,

00:06:13.080 --> 00:06:15.170
and maybe this
point over here E,

00:06:15.170 --> 00:06:18.560
you see that D is
the midpoint of BE.

00:06:18.560 --> 00:06:21.340
And then finally,
the yellow side

00:06:21.340 --> 00:06:22.840
is between the green
and the orange.

00:06:22.840 --> 00:06:24.850
So between the green and the
orange, we have a yellow side.

00:06:24.850 --> 00:06:27.183
Between the green and the
orange you have a yellow side.

00:06:27.183 --> 00:06:28.800
All of these triangles
are congruent.

00:06:28.800 --> 00:06:30.810
So once again, let
me call this F.

00:06:30.810 --> 00:06:35.450
We see that F is
the midpoint of EC.

00:06:35.450 --> 00:06:37.730
So we've done what
we wanted to do.

00:06:37.730 --> 00:06:39.940
We've shown that if you
start with any arbitrary

00:06:39.940 --> 00:06:54.880
triangle, triangle ADF, we can
construct a triangle BCE so

00:06:54.880 --> 00:07:05.750
that ADF is triangle
BCE's medial triangle.

00:07:05.750 --> 00:07:10.890
And all that means is
that the vertices of ADF

00:07:10.890 --> 00:07:14.190
sit on the midpoints of BCE.

00:07:14.190 --> 00:07:16.680
So you might say Sal, that
by itself is interesting,

00:07:16.680 --> 00:07:18.311
but what's the
whole point of this?

00:07:18.311 --> 00:07:19.810
The whole point of
this is actually,

00:07:19.810 --> 00:07:23.310
I wanted to use this fact that
if you give me any triangle,

00:07:23.310 --> 00:07:25.890
I can make it the medial
triangle of the larger one

00:07:25.890 --> 00:07:29.830
to prove that the altitudes of
this triangle are concurrent.

00:07:29.830 --> 00:07:32.730
And to see that, let me
first draw the altitudes.

00:07:32.730 --> 00:07:35.450
So an altitude from
vertex A looks like this.

00:07:35.450 --> 00:07:37.810
It starts at the vertex,
goes to the opposite side,

00:07:37.810 --> 00:07:40.180
and is perpendicular
to the opposite side.

00:07:40.180 --> 00:07:42.620
If I draw an altitude
from vertex D,

00:07:42.620 --> 00:07:44.560
it would look like this.

00:07:44.560 --> 00:07:47.080
And if I draw an
altitude from vertex F,

00:07:47.080 --> 00:07:49.560
it will look like this.

00:07:49.560 --> 00:07:51.620
And what I did, this
whole set up of this video

00:07:51.620 --> 00:07:57.450
is to show, to prove that these
will always be concurrent.

00:07:57.450 --> 00:07:59.880
And you might say,
wait how do we

00:07:59.880 --> 00:08:01.970
know that they are concurrent?

00:08:01.970 --> 00:08:03.720
Well all you have to
do is think about how

00:08:03.720 --> 00:08:06.610
they interact with
the larger triangle.

00:08:06.610 --> 00:08:09.790
What are these altitudes
to the larger triangle?

00:08:09.790 --> 00:08:12.620
Well, this yellow altitude
to the larger triangle.

00:08:12.620 --> 00:08:16.170
Remember, these two yellow
lines, line AD and line CE

00:08:16.170 --> 00:08:17.480
are parallel.

00:08:17.480 --> 00:08:22.070
So if this is a 90-degree angle,
so its alternate interior angle

00:08:22.070 --> 00:08:23.950
is also going to be 90 degrees.

00:08:23.950 --> 00:08:27.120
So this right over here
is perpendicular to CE,

00:08:27.120 --> 00:08:29.890
and it bisects CE,
because we know

00:08:29.890 --> 00:08:32.510
that ADE is the medial triangle.

00:08:32.510 --> 00:08:33.919
This is the midpoint.

00:08:33.919 --> 00:08:36.850
So this right over here
is perpendicular bisector.

00:08:36.850 --> 00:08:42.620
This is a perpendicular bisector
for the larger triangle,

00:08:42.620 --> 00:08:45.620
for triangle BCE.

00:08:45.620 --> 00:08:47.410
So this altitude
for the smaller one

00:08:47.410 --> 00:08:49.550
is a perpendicular bisector
for the larger one.

00:08:49.550 --> 00:08:51.750
We can do that for all of them.

00:08:51.750 --> 00:08:53.972
If this angle right
over here is 90 degrees,

00:08:53.972 --> 00:08:55.430
then this angle
right over there is

00:08:55.430 --> 00:08:58.013
going to be 90 degrees, because
this line is parallel to this,

00:08:58.013 --> 00:09:02.880
this is a transversal, alternate
interior angles are the same.

00:09:02.880 --> 00:09:05.890
So this line right over here,
this altitude of the smaller

00:09:05.890 --> 00:09:09.390
triangle, it bisects right at
the midpoint of the larger one,

00:09:09.390 --> 00:09:12.520
on this side, and it's also
a perpendicular bisector.

00:09:12.520 --> 00:09:15.702
So it's a perpendicular
bisector of the larger triangle.

00:09:15.702 --> 00:09:17.160
And then finally,
the same thing is

00:09:17.160 --> 00:09:19.750
true of this altitude
right over here.

00:09:19.750 --> 00:09:21.820
It bisects this
side of the larger

00:09:21.820 --> 00:09:24.374
triangle at a 90-degree angle.

00:09:24.374 --> 00:09:26.540
We know that because these
two magenta lines the way

00:09:26.540 --> 00:09:28.420
we constructed the
larger triangle,

00:09:28.420 --> 00:09:29.830
they're going to be parallel.

00:09:29.830 --> 00:09:32.550
So once again, this is a
perpendicular bisector.

00:09:32.550 --> 00:09:36.500
So this whole reason, if you
just give me any triangle,

00:09:36.500 --> 00:09:38.220
I can take its
altitudes and I know

00:09:38.220 --> 00:09:40.989
that its altitude are going
to intersect in one point.

00:09:40.989 --> 00:09:42.280
They're going to be concurrent.

00:09:42.280 --> 00:09:45.310
Because for any triangle, I
can make it the medial triangle

00:09:45.310 --> 00:09:47.520
of a larger one, and
then it's altitudes

00:09:47.520 --> 00:09:50.040
will be the perpendicular
bisector for the larger

00:09:50.040 --> 00:09:50.690
triangle.

00:09:50.690 --> 00:09:53.410
And we already know that
the perpendicular bisectors

00:09:53.410 --> 00:09:55.380
for any triangle are concurrent.

00:09:55.380 --> 00:10:00.700
They do intersect in
exactly one point.
