00:00:00.056 --> 00:00:02.006
 Let's say I go to the store today and there 

00:00:02.006 --> 00:00:03.071
 have a sale to Guava 

00:00:03.072 --> 00:00:07.071
 Everything is 30% cheaper 

00:00:07.073 --> 00:00:08.055
 This applies to Guava 

00:00:11.067 --> 00:00:13.034
 And only today 

00:00:13.035 --> 00:00:17.073
 Only today 

00:00:17.075 --> 00:00:21.055
 And I say to you, you know what, I'll take a little guava 

00:00:21.055 --> 00:00:23.085
 So I buy 6 guavas 

00:00:23.085 --> 00:00:27.037
 I buy 6 guavas. 

00:00:27.037 --> 00:00:30.035
 And it ends up, when I go to the register, and we're 

00:00:30.035 --> 00:00:33.046
 assuming no tax, it's a grocery and I live in a state where 

00:00:33.046 --> 00:00:34.089
 they do not tax groceries. 

00:00:34.089 --> 00:00:38.067
 So for the six guavas I bought, I get a 30% discount 

00:00:38.067 --> 00:00:42.049
 I charge 12 BGN and 60 BGN 

00:00:42.050 --> 00:00:44.064
 $ 12.60. 

00:00:44.064 --> 00:00:48.025
 This is the discount price for 6 guavas 

00:00:48.027 --> 00:00:51.028
 I'm going home, and my girlfriend tells me, you know, Iane, 

00:00:51.028 --> 00:00:54.003
 Will you get two more guavas tomorrow? 

00:00:54.003 --> 00:00:54.070
 I say, of course. 

00:00:54.071 --> 00:00:57.077
 So the next day I go and want to buy 2 more fruits 

00:00:57.077 --> 00:01:00.002
 2 guava 22 00: 01: 00,003 -&gt; 00: 01: 01,075 But the sale has passed 

00:01:01.075 --> 00:01:03.004
 No more discount 30% 

00:01:03.006 --> 00:01:05.056
 It was only the first day I bought the six 

00:01:05.056 --> 00:01:09.062
 So how much will these 2 guavas cost me? 

00:01:09.064 --> 00:01:14.065
 How much is the real price of these guavas? 

00:01:14.065 --> 00:01:19.079
 The whole price 

00:01:19.079 --> 00:01:22.051
 A good start would be to think about how much 

00:01:22.053 --> 00:01:25.023
 They would cost those 6 guavas without the reduction 

00:01:25.023 --> 00:01:26.059
 That's the price here 

00:01:26.059 --> 00:01:29.017
 This is the price 

00:01:29.018 --> 00:01:32.048
 How much would they cost me without the reduction? 

00:01:32.050 --> 00:01:36.034
 Let's find out with some algebra 

00:01:36.034 --> 00:01:39.056
 Let's choose the right color for algebra 

00:01:39.056 --> 00:01:40.078
 Maybe this gray color 

00:01:40.079 --> 00:01:47.015
 Let's say x is the price of 6 guavas 

00:01:47.015 --> 00:01:53.062
 six guavas without a reduction. 

00:01:53.062 --> 00:01:56.007
 In fact, if we take 30% of that 

00:01:56.009 --> 00:01:57.093
 we need to get 12.60. . 

00:01:57.095 --> 00:01:59.004
 Let's do that 

00:01:59.004 --> 00:02:02.021
 So if we have the whole price of 6 guavas, we will 

00:02:02.023 --> 00:02:04.018
 we take 30% of it 

00:02:04.018 --> 00:02:07.028
 This is the same as 0.30. 

00:02:07.029 --> 00:02:08.068
 or I can just write 0.3. 

00:02:08.068 --> 00:02:10.074
 I could ignore zero if I want to. 

00:02:10.074 --> 00:02:11.062
 Actually, let's write it like that 

00:02:11.062 --> 00:02:14.046
 My girlfriend always makes me write the zeros before the dozen 

00:02:14.046 --> 00:02:20.065
 So this is the price of 6 guavas minus 0.30 multiplied 

00:02:20.065 --> 00:02:22.094
 at the real price 

00:02:22.096 --> 00:02:26.034
 So I only take 30% of the real price 

00:02:26.034 --> 00:02:27.050
 of the real price. 

00:02:27.052 --> 00:02:29.088
 So we'll find her. 

00:02:29.090 --> 00:02:34.046
 This will be equal to $ 12.60 here. 

00:02:34.046 --> 00:02:37.053
 This will be equal to 12.60lv. 

00:02:37.053 --> 00:02:39.088
 I just took 30% of the whole price 

00:02:39.090 --> 00:02:41.018
 And now we're just making algebra. 

00:02:41.018 --> 00:02:43.012
 We can imagine that there is a unit in front of x - you know, 

00:02:43.012 --> 00:02:45.000
 x is the same as 1x. 

00:02:45.002 --> 00:02:50.028
 So 1x minus 0.3x will be equal to 0.7x. 

00:02:50.028 --> 00:02:54.022
 And togaway 0.7x, or we can say 0.70 if you like. 

00:02:54.024 --> 00:02:55.015
 It is the same number 

00:02:55.015 --> 00:03:00.006
 Point, or 0.7x is equal to 12.60. 

00:03:00.006 --> 00:03:02.012
 And once you get used to these tasks, you can skip 

00:03:02.012 --> 00:03:03.077
 right up to this step 

00:03:03.078 --> 00:03:07.065
 where you say 70% of the total price = 

00:03:07.065 --> 00:03:08.053
 the price of the reduced fruit 

00:03:08.055 --> 00:03:09.099
 I removed 30% 

00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:12.015
 These are 70% of the total price 

00:03:12.015 --> 00:03:14.036
 You can move on to this step as you get used to it 

00:03:14.036 --> 00:03:15.025
 with these tasks. 

00:03:15.027 --> 00:03:16.077
 And now we have to find x. 

00:03:16.078 --> 00:03:21.003
 Divide the two parts to 0.7 to get that x = 

00:03:21.003 --> 00:03:26.036
 12.60 divided by 0.7. 

00:03:26.037 --> 00:03:28.096
 You can use a calculator, but it's always better 

00:03:28.096 --> 00:03:31.005
 to practice with the dozens 

00:03:31.006 --> 00:03:31.086
 So let's do that 

00:03:31.086 --> 00:03:38.058
 0.7 holds at 12.60. 

00:03:38.059 --> 00:03:41.087
 let's multiply the two numbers by 10, which we do like 

00:03:41.087 --> 00:03:45.025
 move the comma, the decimal to the right. 

00:03:45.027 --> 00:03:47.058
 So 0.7 is going to 7. 

00:03:47.058 --> 00:03:49.003
 Do not pay attention to this here 

00:03:49.003 --> 00:03:53.096
 12.60 goes to 126, put the comma right here 

00:03:53.096 --> 00:03:55.033
 The tenth right there 

00:03:55.034 --> 00:03:57.068
 And now we are ready for the great division 

00:03:57.068 --> 00:04:00.011
 This is now 7, not 0.7 

00:04:00.012 --> 00:04:03.021
 7 fits at 12 once 

00:04:03.021 --> 00:04:05.091
 1 in 7 is 7 

00:04:05.093 --> 00:04:08.062
 12 - 7 = 5 

00:04:08.062 --> 00:04:10.086
 Download below 6 

00:04:10.087 --> 00:04:15.033
 7 ranks in 56 eight times 

00:04:15.034 --> 00:04:18.037
 8 at 7 = 56 

00:04:18.037 --> 00:04:20.039
 and we have nothing left to do 

00:04:20.041 --> 00:04:22.081
 So 18, and there is nothing after the comma 

00:04:22.081 --> 00:04:25.087
 In our case, we get 18 

00:04:25.087 --> 00:04:30.079
 So x is equal to BGN 18. 

00:04:30.080 --> 00:04:36.074
 Remember what was x? x was the total price of guavas 

00:04:36.075 --> 00:04:39.092
 x was the full price of 6 

00:04:39.092 --> 00:04:42.006
 x is the actual cost of 6 guava 

00:04:42.006 --> 00:04:44.066
 Now, the question is, how much will it cost me 2 guavas 

00:04:44.067 --> 00:04:46.022
 at full cost? 

00:04:46.022 --> 00:04:52.069
 This is the price for 6 

00:04:52.069 --> 00:04:54.031
 You should immediately remember how much it is 

00:04:54.032 --> 00:04:56.050
 the actual price 

00:04:56.051 --> 00:04:58.062
 Shares 18 to 6 

00:04:58.062 --> 00:05:01.075
 Which is equal to 3 

00:05:01.075 --> 00:05:09.045
 Ie. 3lv. for guavas 

00:05:09.047 --> 00:05:11.086
 And they ask us if we want 2 guavas 

00:05:11.087 --> 00:05:14.026
 And two guavas are 2 at 3 leva. 

00:05:14.026 --> 00:05:16.073
 which is 6 BGN. 

00:05:16.074 --> 00:05:17.055
 6lv. 

00:05:17.055 --> 00:05:19.005
 You could say, hey 

00:05:19.005 --> 00:05:22.099
 6 fetuses without a reduction would cost me 18 lv. 

00:05:23.000 --> 00:05:25.062
 2 is one third of 6 

00:05:25.062 --> 00:05:28.043
 And a third of 18 is 6 

00:05:28.043 --> 00:05:31.011
 Let's repeat briefly what we did 

00:05:31.012 --> 00:05:34.074
 We said we bought guavas for 12.60. . 

00:05:34.075 --> 00:05:37.035
 Which is a 30% discount 

00:05:37.036 --> 00:05:41.029
 Or you could say 70% of the real price 

00:05:41.029 --> 00:05:45.075
 70% of the total price 

00:05:45.075 --> 00:05:49.050
 Then we said that 30% - if we take x for the real price 

00:05:49.050 --> 00:05:53.056
 on 6 guavas, you can tell the real price of 6 guavas minus 

00:05:53.056 --> 00:05:57.077
 30% of the real price of 6 is equal to 12.60lv. 

00:05:57.079 --> 00:06:02.012
 which is also like, 70% of the redeemed price is 12.60. 

00:06:02.012 --> 00:06:04.031
 We divorced - and then we algered it algebraically 

00:06:04.032 --> 00:06:08.013
 we divided the two sides to 0.7, and we got the x, the real price 

00:06:08.013 --> 00:06:14.081
 of 6 guavas, which is 18, or 3 for guavas or 6lv. for two 

00:06:14.081 --> 00:06:17.036
 I hope all of this has helped you.
