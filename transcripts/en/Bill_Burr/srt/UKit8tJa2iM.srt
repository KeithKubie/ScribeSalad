1
00:00:01,410 --> 00:00:02,243
Okay.

2
00:00:02,480 --> 00:00:05,720
Hey, what's going on? It's Bill Burr and
it's time for the Thursday afternoon,

3
00:00:05,721 --> 00:00:09,290
just before Friday,
Monday morning podcast.

4
00:00:09,740 --> 00:00:13,070
And I am just checking in on you.

5
00:00:14,850 --> 00:00:17,940
I'm not yelling at,
I'm in Houston right now and I have a,

6
00:00:17,941 --> 00:00:20,580
I got a show here in a couple
of hours and you know, Bill is,

7
00:00:20,610 --> 00:00:25,110
I am in an advanced age at this point.
You know,

8
00:00:25,290 --> 00:00:26,370
this is how old I am.

9
00:00:27,240 --> 00:00:30,390
I now qualify for something
I never heard of before.

10
00:00:30,391 --> 00:00:35,100
It's called a I p. A. R. P.
I don't know what it does.

11
00:00:35,220 --> 00:00:38,010
It's for old guys like me.
We're not 65.

12
00:00:38,400 --> 00:00:42,480
We're 50 and evidently I can now
go to the movie for eight bucks.

13
00:00:45,440 --> 00:00:48,900
I'd probably get a free side of Metamucil,
you know,

14
00:00:48,901 --> 00:00:53,760
maybe a little Ben [inaudible] Ben
gay when I walk out, but I'm site. So,

15
00:00:54,360 --> 00:00:59,010
um, yeah, don't let anybody ever tell
you that getting old fucking sucks. Okay?

16
00:00:59,011 --> 00:01:02,220
Yeah, it does. You body breaks down.
Eventually you take a dirt nap.

17
00:01:02,221 --> 00:01:04,320
Who's getting who?
You know,

18
00:01:05,770 --> 00:01:09,300
you fucking surrounded by loved ones.
As you're laying there,

19
00:01:09,301 --> 00:01:13,480
everybody's bottom lip quivering. Did
you just sit now? Was I a good person,

20
00:01:14,400 --> 00:01:17,290
good person, right. Yeah. That sucks.

21
00:01:20,830 --> 00:01:24,850
But there's a lot of shit that
balances it off. All right.

22
00:01:25,860 --> 00:01:27,850
$8 tickets to movies,
Bam.

23
00:01:29,720 --> 00:01:33,700
Talking Shit to somebody in their
twenties. You know, like you're a Badass,

24
00:01:33,770 --> 00:01:35,750
but you're too old for
them to fuck with you.

25
00:01:35,870 --> 00:01:40,400
So you look tough right in front
of your 50 year old wife bomb.

26
00:01:43,670 --> 00:01:47,180
MMM. I mean, that's pretty much
the extent of it. I haven't really,

27
00:01:47,360 --> 00:01:51,080
I'm new to this being fucking
over the hill here. Uh,

28
00:01:51,770 --> 00:01:52,603
but you know,

29
00:01:53,790 --> 00:01:53,940
yeah.

30
00:01:53,940 --> 00:01:55,320
Getting aware of stupid hat.

31
00:01:56,670 --> 00:01:56,780
Yeah.

32
00:01:56,780 --> 00:02:00,920
Right. One of those fucking old man coats.
I can't fuck. I mean it's, it's okay.

33
00:02:00,921 --> 00:02:04,970
I can't wait, but uh, I'm
going to enjoy it. Um,

34
00:02:05,570 --> 00:02:09,620
anyways, uh, before we get started, I
have a couple of things to promote. Oh,

35
00:02:09,621 --> 00:02:14,240
rough and rowdy brawl. August 5th, uh,

36
00:02:14,270 --> 00:02:18,710
the people over there when nice
enough l pres, Dave Portnoy's,

37
00:02:19,590 --> 00:02:22,700
uh, was nice enough to invite me back
and of course I jumped at the chance.

38
00:02:22,701 --> 00:02:26,170
I had such a great time the last time
when we were in fucking Charlotte.

39
00:02:28,130 --> 00:02:32,740
Um, it's so cool. And I will show up to
these things as long as they have made,

40
00:02:32,741 --> 00:02:36,200
because a, it's a, it's ridiculously fun.

41
00:02:36,201 --> 00:02:40,760
So it's going to be in
Youngstown, Ohio. All right.

42
00:02:40,761 --> 00:02:45,150
Kids come out of the womb swinging.
All right.

43
00:02:45,390 --> 00:02:49,550
When the doctor hits the baby on the ass
in Youngstown, he's wearing headgear.

44
00:02:49,590 --> 00:02:53,360
That's all I'm saying. And a mouthpiece.
Um, all right. But we get it to tough.

45
00:02:53,620 --> 00:02:56,520
All right. Who knows, I don't
know what their deal is there.

46
00:02:56,521 --> 00:02:59,940
I don't know why they're so
tough there. I imagine, you know,

47
00:03:00,930 --> 00:03:04,430
I think each little pool of people,
you know, starts off with a,

48
00:03:04,431 --> 00:03:08,080
with a couple of Adam and Eve's.
Right? And they bang and then whatever,

49
00:03:08,170 --> 00:03:11,580
if they're in the books, then
you get like Seattle, you know,

50
00:03:11,581 --> 00:03:14,250
but if they got hammered and they
beat the shit out of each other, yeah,

51
00:03:14,251 --> 00:03:17,700
you get Youngstown.
I haven't researched any of this,

52
00:03:17,701 --> 00:03:19,440
but I don't know what all I know is,

53
00:03:19,441 --> 00:03:22,050
I'm not looking at anybody in the eye
when I get there, cause I don't, I don't,

54
00:03:22,051 --> 00:03:26,220
I don't need to be clocked by
fucking Kelly Pavlics third cousin.

55
00:03:28,590 --> 00:03:31,240
Um, but anyways, so I,
I got to do a Gig. A,

56
00:03:31,241 --> 00:03:33,990
I'm going to do a gig right before I
get there. I'm going to be in Rochester,

57
00:03:33,991 --> 00:03:35,910
New York.
All right.

58
00:03:35,940 --> 00:03:39,930
I believe home is Steve Gadd
childhood home. I remember he was,

59
00:03:39,931 --> 00:03:43,230
I remember that I used to watch the
instructional DVD that he had a zillion

60
00:03:43,231 --> 00:03:47,940
times up close and he would talk about
how he got his hands together playing in

61
00:03:47,941 --> 00:03:52,500
the Rochester Crusaders.
It was a drum corps. Um,

62
00:03:52,590 --> 00:03:56,880
I know crazy information, but whatever
it's in my head, I got to get it up. Um,

63
00:03:56,881 --> 00:04:00,960
so that will be on August 4th, August
5th, I'll be driving down to Youngstown.

64
00:04:02,560 --> 00:04:03,393
MMM.

65
00:04:03,630 --> 00:04:04,650
For rough and rowdy.

66
00:04:04,710 --> 00:04:08,940
So go to rough and rowdy
brawl.com to get your tickets.

67
00:04:10,320 --> 00:04:13,710
Um, to stream it. Whatever you got to
do, it's going to be fucking awesome.

68
00:04:13,920 --> 00:04:16,830
And I've already seen some
of the highlights so I
should really retweet some of

69
00:04:16,831 --> 00:04:20,040
the, some of the guys, they got
some Pittsburgh, Cleveland guys,

70
00:04:20,041 --> 00:04:25,041
no love lost there with all the Steelers
trophies and a Cleveland's baron shelf.

71
00:04:26,340 --> 00:04:29,430
Cause for some reason they
don't count NFL titles,

72
00:04:30,690 --> 00:04:34,710
which Cleveland one I think in 65,
but you know, as far as franchises go,

73
00:04:34,711 --> 00:04:38,220
that went out to fucking Baltimore,
Baltimore,

74
00:04:39,030 --> 00:04:42,720
Scarface reference. Um, any hoo,

75
00:04:42,780 --> 00:04:47,500
I'm here in a Houston,
Texas. I'm like, God,

76
00:04:47,501 --> 00:04:50,380
I thought it was going to be
fucking brutally hot. I was like,

77
00:04:51,690 --> 00:04:54,120
I was almost ready to
call my agent and be like,

78
00:04:54,180 --> 00:04:57,360
how many fucking years have
you been in this business?

79
00:04:58,170 --> 00:05:03,170
Slash how many years have you been
booking me that you would book a bald,

80
00:05:04,340 --> 00:05:05,173
redheaded male?

81
00:05:06,010 --> 00:05:06,190
Yeah,

82
00:05:06,190 --> 00:05:11,190
that qualifies for Arp in Houston,

83
00:05:11,201 --> 00:05:14,620
Texas in fucking July.
But um,

84
00:05:15,180 --> 00:05:17,410
when we were coming in for Atlanta and
I was looking out the window and I'll,

85
00:05:17,411 --> 00:05:21,970
all the, you know, fields that I saw
were green. So it was like, all right,

86
00:05:21,971 --> 00:05:25,270
maybe they getting some rain, I don't
know. But it's not that bad down here.

87
00:05:26,510 --> 00:05:31,220
The bad thing is, is I forgot
my show shoes. You know,

88
00:05:31,640 --> 00:05:33,320
for those of you not in show business,

89
00:05:33,321 --> 00:05:36,470
you have your shoes that you
walk around in your shoes,

90
00:05:36,471 --> 00:05:41,030
your workout in or whatever. All right.
This is a very first world here, okay?

91
00:05:41,031 --> 00:05:44,750
For those, those of you listening
in lesser countries, okay,

92
00:05:44,751 --> 00:05:48,770
we are so privileged here that we
have shoes for different events.

93
00:05:48,860 --> 00:05:53,420
I need to work out, right? I'm
going to fucking wear these shoes.

94
00:05:54,590 --> 00:05:59,120
I'm going to go, uh, I don't know. Go run
some errands. Oh, I think I'll grab those.

95
00:06:00,020 --> 00:06:02,570
And then you got to put on a show,
a dance like a monkey.

96
00:06:02,750 --> 00:06:05,540
You have these other fucking shows.
Now I know other people in other towns,

97
00:06:05,541 --> 00:06:09,290
you know, uh, countries I should say.
You know, you've got one pair of shoes.

98
00:06:09,291 --> 00:06:10,430
If you're lucky,
right?

99
00:06:11,330 --> 00:06:15,650
You and 18 other people jump on a fucking
moped with 37 boxes and somehow you

100
00:06:15,651 --> 00:06:18,710
don't tip over. You go down the street
making fucking Instagram videos.

101
00:06:18,950 --> 00:06:23,660
I see out there, I see out there all
the time. I don't know how you'd do it.

102
00:06:25,800 --> 00:06:27,870
Is it like young style where
you just grow up fighting?

103
00:06:27,871 --> 00:06:32,400
You guys just grow up fucking stack
and shit up on tea. It makes no sense.

104
00:06:33,420 --> 00:06:34,850
And Somehow they stay upright.

105
00:06:34,890 --> 00:06:39,180
Everybody always watch his fucking evil
Knievel jumping over the buses with a,

106
00:06:39,181 --> 00:06:44,070
with a motorcycle that probably weighed
like four to 500,000 fucking pounds.

107
00:06:45,030 --> 00:06:49,290
You know, as great as that is, as
impressive as that is, you know,

108
00:06:50,130 --> 00:06:52,680
to drive down the street with
all your personal belongings,

109
00:06:52,710 --> 00:06:57,660
your wife and all of your
kids with that much to lose.

110
00:06:57,661 --> 00:07:00,720
I don't think evil Knievel can touch that,
you know?

111
00:07:02,480 --> 00:07:04,640
Cause if he wiped out,
he died. That was it.

112
00:07:05,330 --> 00:07:10,100
He didn't lose fucking everything
and all his clothes. All right,

113
00:07:10,101 --> 00:07:15,040
so that's wanting to grow on next
time they say evil Knievel is, is,

114
00:07:15,090 --> 00:07:18,740
is the grandfather of
fucking, uh, the x games.

115
00:07:19,680 --> 00:07:22,700
All right? You know, there's
always somebody else.
Everybody talks about Edison.

116
00:07:22,880 --> 00:07:27,520
There's always a Tesla. I'm
sorry, what do you want from me?

117
00:07:27,521 --> 00:07:29,140
I got to fill up a fucking half hour here.

118
00:07:29,290 --> 00:07:33,820
I'm waiting for my salad
with a protein coming. Um,

119
00:07:34,510 --> 00:07:37,180
I've been doing real well with the whole
eating and everything and I actually

120
00:07:37,181 --> 00:07:39,280
got in contact with a nutritionist.

121
00:07:41,460 --> 00:07:44,220
I took a long pause there for all
you guys would be like, Oh gee,

122
00:07:44,221 --> 00:07:48,000
you are you going to do next? You get to
get botox. You fucking freckled can't,

123
00:07:48,420 --> 00:07:49,253
Huh?

124
00:07:49,840 --> 00:07:53,220
You're going to find some ginger cat and
skin it and put the fucking hair on top

125
00:07:53,221 --> 00:07:54,690
of your head. Well, maybe I will.

126
00:07:57,250 --> 00:08:01,150
That makes me feel better about myself.
Fuck that cat.

127
00:08:03,280 --> 00:08:04,700
Never been a cat person.
Right.

128
00:08:06,280 --> 00:08:08,980
You know why they have such attitudes
is cause they're allowed to shit in the

129
00:08:08,981 --> 00:08:12,580
house and then they think you're on the
same level and then they're faster than

130
00:08:12,581 --> 00:08:15,820
you and then it's over.
Then you can, you know,

131
00:08:15,821 --> 00:08:19,510
you can instill like fucking martial
law with the water spray bottle.

132
00:08:20,020 --> 00:08:22,150
You don't want to fucking do that.
Although I would enjoy doing that.

133
00:08:22,180 --> 00:08:25,570
I would actually, you know, if I wasn't in
this business, I would do that as a job.

134
00:08:27,400 --> 00:08:31,090
Um, is I don't like cats.
I respect him. I do,

135
00:08:31,091 --> 00:08:35,110
but I would get an a lot of enjoyment
spraying water at cats that jump on the

136
00:08:35,111 --> 00:08:39,880
back of couches. Is that actually
a career? Can you do that?

137
00:08:40,300 --> 00:08:42,220
Is that how my life's going to end?
Wait a minute,

138
00:08:45,530 --> 00:08:49,760
is that what's going to happen? I'm going
to die alone with like a cat, you know,

139
00:08:49,790 --> 00:08:50,750
have a cigar,

140
00:08:50,930 --> 00:08:55,200
a little glass of fucking
whiskey or something and
I'll just be sitting there in

141
00:08:55,201 --> 00:08:58,950
my rocking chair spread of all these,
all these fucking cats.

142
00:08:58,951 --> 00:09:03,150
So that'll be like my fucking
playstation 19 right. Cause I, you know,

143
00:09:03,151 --> 00:09:04,320
I wouldn't have saved my money.

144
00:09:04,321 --> 00:09:09,321
I'll have all these fucking cats and I'll
just be spraying and I'm just cackling

145
00:09:09,331 --> 00:09:13,740
laughing until like Keel over like
Brando and fucking the Godfather.

146
00:09:15,390 --> 00:09:17,670
Jesus built you really by know. I
don't know what it is. You know?

147
00:09:17,671 --> 00:09:20,670
I was doing so well with my anger
and just late. I just fucking,

148
00:09:20,700 --> 00:09:23,700
I just been losing it lately.
Fucking losing it.

149
00:09:25,650 --> 00:09:29,690
I don't know. I think I need to
let it out. It's Kinda like Busan.

150
00:09:29,700 --> 00:09:32,610
It's like if I don't do
it then it just builds up.

151
00:09:33,210 --> 00:09:36,690
I went online yesterday looking up like
what are you, what you call that a,

152
00:09:37,440 --> 00:09:40,260
it's not a fifth of Jack Daniels.
It's the smaller ones,

153
00:09:40,261 --> 00:09:43,140
the little brother to that one.
That's always been my favorite.

154
00:09:43,141 --> 00:09:46,830
If you just going to get fucking
hammered, he'd get that size of it. Right.

155
00:09:47,640 --> 00:09:51,120
I was just talking to Nate Craig, who's,
who's going to be with me this weekend,

156
00:09:51,690 --> 00:09:56,130
crushing it in front of me. I was saying,
I like that size. You're poured over on,

157
00:09:56,180 --> 00:10:00,870
on the rocks. You don't get like,
there's no guilt that you're, you're,

158
00:10:01,220 --> 00:10:04,590
you, you're wasting this booze that's
been in a barrel for fucking, I dunno,

159
00:10:04,890 --> 00:10:08,790
since Nixon was in office and you just
sit in there and getting shit faced,

160
00:10:09,060 --> 00:10:12,120
watching a baseball game. It's,
you know, it's Jack Daniels, this,

161
00:10:12,121 --> 00:10:16,410
there's plenty of it. Right? And
then when you finish the bottle,

162
00:10:16,411 --> 00:10:18,240
you get like a sense of accomplishment.

163
00:10:19,200 --> 00:10:22,750
So that's all that not boozing
does for me. It just makes me, uh,

164
00:10:23,320 --> 00:10:28,020
makes me want to booze more. And I think
like not flipping out is the same thing.

165
00:10:28,800 --> 00:10:33,750
All right. Now for those of you new to
the podcast, um, if you're questioning,

166
00:10:33,751 --> 00:10:38,610
did he just justify not controlling
his emotions and his drinking problem?

167
00:10:38,640 --> 00:10:42,660
Yes, I did. Yes I did. And
thank you for noticing.

168
00:10:44,250 --> 00:10:48,810
Um, I don't have fucking drinking
problem. I drink just fine.

169
00:10:50,040 --> 00:10:53,100
What I have is a drinking buddy problem.

170
00:10:54,480 --> 00:10:57,060
Can't seem to get anybody
I can fucking drink with.

171
00:10:57,380 --> 00:11:01,200
That ain't going to be sitting there
counting my fucking drinks are right now.

172
00:11:01,201 --> 00:11:05,580
We both went to public schools. We can
both count up to 20 Yang Preston, me.

173
00:11:06,460 --> 00:11:08,550
All right.
You want to press me by fucking round.

174
00:11:09,390 --> 00:11:11,530
Quit reminded me that I drove tonight.

175
00:11:12,360 --> 00:11:16,800
The fuck could fucking drive that car.
My fucking sleep.

176
00:11:17,430 --> 00:11:20,610
I'll back it on home.
You keep fucking talking.

177
00:11:21,540 --> 00:11:26,250
That's my main or alcoholic
is a fucking redneck. Um,

178
00:11:27,510 --> 00:11:31,590
anyways, oh, shout out to Chris
Hardwick. Congratulations.

179
00:11:31,591 --> 00:11:35,010
They investigated and they found
out what most of us already knew.

180
00:11:35,040 --> 00:11:36,000
You're a good guy.

181
00:11:36,780 --> 00:11:41,310
And it was nice to see one of those
ones that seemed really sort of fucking

182
00:11:41,311 --> 00:11:46,311
frivolous be investigated thoroughly
according to CNN entertainment.

183
00:11:47,400 --> 00:11:49,890
And you know, that's a, that that was,

184
00:11:49,970 --> 00:11:53,950
that needed to fucking happen because uh,
you know,

185
00:11:54,130 --> 00:11:57,460
that whole me too movement was supposed
to be for people that were like victims.

186
00:11:57,461 --> 00:12:00,040
It wasn't supposed to be,
you know,

187
00:12:00,520 --> 00:12:04,950
something to be used to
get back at somebody,

188
00:12:05,130 --> 00:12:06,960
you know, I don't know. I shouldn't,

189
00:12:06,961 --> 00:12:09,300
I guess allegedly whenever the
fuck you're supposed to say.

190
00:12:09,301 --> 00:12:13,860
But it was nice to see that AMC
took the time to investigate it,

191
00:12:14,340 --> 00:12:15,930
saw that nothing happened.

192
00:12:16,620 --> 00:12:19,170
They were satisfied with it
and they brought the guy back.

193
00:12:19,230 --> 00:12:24,150
There you go. There you go. I hope

194
00:12:24,340 --> 00:12:26,570
that this is like, you know,
cause it kinda needed that.

195
00:12:26,730 --> 00:12:28,580
And then there was the initial fucking,
you know,

196
00:12:30,960 --> 00:12:33,200
because nobody listened to women.
So then it just,

197
00:12:33,330 --> 00:12:35,910
there was just this
floodgate of fucking anger.

198
00:12:35,911 --> 00:12:37,320
You had to ride through it and just,

199
00:12:37,321 --> 00:12:41,610
you knew eventually somebody who didn't
do shit was going to go down. So it's,

200
00:12:41,611 --> 00:12:45,210
it's nice to see that they,
they rectified that situation.

201
00:12:46,740 --> 00:12:47,110
Yeah.

202
00:12:47,110 --> 00:12:50,100
I just get myself in trouble by
saying rectified. Is that too much?

203
00:12:50,101 --> 00:12:53,460
Like rectal than I just,
I just advocate something you get made.

204
00:12:53,461 --> 00:12:57,510
It's just a strange time, you know? Um,

205
00:12:57,960 --> 00:13:00,420
anyways, um, plowing ahead here.

206
00:13:02,240 --> 00:13:02,820
MMM.

207
00:13:02,820 --> 00:13:04,920
Yeah.
So I forgot my God damn show shoes.

208
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:09,440
All right. Um, uh, you know,

209
00:13:09,970 --> 00:13:12,790
I'm becoming Billy minimalist but not,
not on this level.

210
00:13:12,791 --> 00:13:17,290
Like I like to wear a nice pair of fucking
sneakers or shoes when I do my shows

211
00:13:17,820 --> 00:13:19,200
and uh,

212
00:13:20,400 --> 00:13:23,610
I don't have them what I have,
I just have my fucking workout sneakers.

213
00:13:23,611 --> 00:13:27,390
So I'm going to go out there looking shop
from the ankles up and then I'm going

214
00:13:27,391 --> 00:13:31,380
to have these big clunky
fucking 50 year old white guy.

215
00:13:31,381 --> 00:13:35,040
My feet hurt sometimes
sneakers on. So, you know,

216
00:13:36,600 --> 00:13:39,210
I give it about seven minutes
before somebody heckles me.

217
00:13:39,750 --> 00:13:40,830
Well now that I've put it out there,

218
00:13:40,831 --> 00:13:42,570
someone's going to do it
and think they're original.

219
00:13:43,650 --> 00:13:46,200
Or maybe it's their way of saying
that they listened to the podcast.

220
00:13:46,201 --> 00:13:46,650
I don't know,

221
00:13:46,650 --> 00:13:49,320
but I'm going to beat all of you cause
I'm just going to come out and address it.

222
00:13:51,430 --> 00:13:52,263
MMM.

223
00:13:53,140 --> 00:13:54,410
Anyways, you know what they
look like? They actually,

224
00:13:54,411 --> 00:13:55,970
they don't even look like men's sneakers.

225
00:13:55,971 --> 00:14:00,410
You know those fucking sneakers that like
old lady was old ladies with big feet

226
00:14:00,411 --> 00:14:05,090
get, you know, you see them on the
bus, they just have like, you see him,

227
00:14:05,091 --> 00:14:09,320
the cute little old ladies and they just
have these giant fucking sneakers over

228
00:14:09,321 --> 00:14:12,110
their feet. You know what I mean?
That's what they look like. No,

229
00:14:12,111 --> 00:14:15,050
they're not all white Reeboks
from the late eighties.

230
00:14:19,950 --> 00:14:20,783
MMM.

231
00:14:21,720 --> 00:14:24,560
Anyway, so I am really
looking forward to, uh,

232
00:14:24,920 --> 00:14:28,250
I got two days here in Houston
and then I got one in Dallas. Uh,

233
00:14:28,270 --> 00:14:30,320
Houston's going to be fun.
Thousand is going to be awesome,

234
00:14:30,321 --> 00:14:33,740
but it's going to be a little sad.
Um,

235
00:14:33,770 --> 00:14:37,490
because this is my first time going to
Dallas and with Vinnie Paul not being

236
00:14:37,491 --> 00:14:40,910
around anymore and he was a big comedy
fan and he was somebody that I always

237
00:14:40,911 --> 00:14:43,940
made sure I reached out to and I had a 50,

238
00:14:43,941 --> 00:14:47,690
50 chance because he also lived in Vegas
that, uh, he was going to be in town,

239
00:14:48,730 --> 00:14:51,990
but um, yeah, going to suck. I was just

240
00:14:51,990 --> 00:14:56,610
talking to a buddy of mine who
was hanging out with Vinny, um,

241
00:14:57,150 --> 00:15:01,860
just a few days before he passed and
he was saying he used to always quote

242
00:15:01,861 --> 00:15:05,100
Comedians' bits and he would
always like mess him up.

243
00:15:05,101 --> 00:15:09,400
He was just the funniest fucking guy
ever, man. God dammit. Um, anyways,

244
00:15:09,401 --> 00:15:11,200
so I'll be going up there in,

245
00:15:11,240 --> 00:15:15,210
in my mind will be
dedicating my show to him.

246
00:15:15,470 --> 00:15:18,290
So that means I have to go hard,
but by the wave, I don't know how I,

247
00:15:18,310 --> 00:15:22,050
I missed all of this pan terrorists shit
now that I'm like totally fucking into

248
00:15:22,051 --> 00:15:27,051
them and like trying to play drums
along to their amazing music.

249
00:15:27,300 --> 00:15:31,780
And um, somebody sent me the, uh,

250
00:15:33,600 --> 00:15:37,910
the official video to unbroken, which
I never saw. And what I love is they,

251
00:15:38,130 --> 00:15:42,840
they spent enough time on Vinny that
I saw all this shit that I was playing

252
00:15:42,841 --> 00:15:46,230
wrong as far as, uh, oh,
whatever. Just, you know,

253
00:15:46,830 --> 00:15:50,550
the two opening crashes, like I
didn't know he had like four crashes,

254
00:15:50,720 --> 00:15:53,310
two on each side.
And then there was another part,

255
00:15:53,311 --> 00:15:56,400
I thought he was playing aids and he
was playing sixties pretty fucking cool.

256
00:15:56,401 --> 00:15:58,290
You don't get that a lot in music videos.

257
00:15:59,010 --> 00:16:02,040
Music videos usually
barely shows the drummer.

258
00:16:02,190 --> 00:16:07,190
And when they do they have the snare when
he's hitting the snare or he or she is

259
00:16:07,231 --> 00:16:09,960
hitting the snare.
It's on the one in three in the bass,

260
00:16:10,710 --> 00:16:12,390
the bass drums on two and four.

261
00:16:12,480 --> 00:16:17,430
I cannot tell you how many fucking
times they do that. It's like,

262
00:16:17,431 --> 00:16:19,350
are you even listening
to the music right now?

263
00:16:20,790 --> 00:16:23,130
You're hearing the crack of the
snare and you got him fucking,

264
00:16:23,310 --> 00:16:27,900
you're lining up the video
and he's hitting the fucking
bass drum. If anything,

265
00:16:29,430 --> 00:16:32,700
and the music videos
genre drove me more nuts.

266
00:16:33,660 --> 00:16:37,680
There wasn't anything. It was that that
they would never fucking show the drama.

267
00:16:37,830 --> 00:16:42,740
And when they did they, it was
just like they didn't give a fuck.

268
00:16:43,520 --> 00:16:46,730
I think they just looked at the right
hand to just line up the music and that

269
00:16:46,731 --> 00:16:49,100
was it. And then, then he didn't
see what else we was fucking,

270
00:16:49,110 --> 00:16:53,570
the amount of times they
cut to like the singer,

271
00:16:53,960 --> 00:16:56,730
he sing in some part and you see
the drummer playing the F uh,

272
00:16:57,230 --> 00:17:01,340
Phil that you don't even hear or you hear
of Phil and the guys just play in the

273
00:17:01,341 --> 00:17:06,020
beat. It just, you know, oh, the fucking
guitarists does some, oh Jesus Christ.

274
00:17:07,560 --> 00:17:11,320
So make sure we fucking line that up.
Note for note the singer, pay attention.

275
00:17:11,321 --> 00:17:14,350
I always like fuck the drama.
So anyways,

276
00:17:14,351 --> 00:17:18,400
it's a great video because they did
not do that in that video. Sorry.

277
00:17:18,430 --> 00:17:21,010
Look at me getting all worked
up over nothing. So anyways,

278
00:17:21,370 --> 00:17:26,370
I'm a friend of mine got me in touch with
the nutritionist and this is not code

279
00:17:27,521 --> 00:17:32,200
name for a drug dealer.
Somebody just knock on my door.
Oh Jesus. Hang on a second.

280
00:17:34,150 --> 00:17:34,983
Anyways,

281
00:17:36,150 --> 00:17:37,150
so,
uh,

282
00:17:38,070 --> 00:17:43,010
I got this fucking nutritionist cause
I wanna learn, I wanna learn how to eat

283
00:17:43,570 --> 00:17:45,150
well.
Um,

284
00:17:46,840 --> 00:17:48,820
you know what I mean? I don't want
to just be this guy like, hey,

285
00:17:50,280 --> 00:17:53,580
I'm going to fucking cut this out and
I'm going to start fucking doing it.

286
00:17:53,581 --> 00:17:56,100
You know, like I mentioned
before, like how many,

287
00:17:56,110 --> 00:17:58,530
like the amount of fat fucking vegans

288
00:17:59,980 --> 00:18:01,390
I'm talking like back fat,

289
00:18:01,391 --> 00:18:03,700
I'm not just saying they got a
little pooch or something like that.

290
00:18:03,701 --> 00:18:07,930
I'm just talking about like, you
know, just looking at people,

291
00:18:07,931 --> 00:18:10,690
like you just look at him like you,
you look like you're not healthy.

292
00:18:12,280 --> 00:18:15,730
And they'll be like, oh, I'm a vegetarian
or I'm fucking Vegan and all of that.

293
00:18:16,030 --> 00:18:20,110
So anyways, like I mentioned, say,
bring the fucking food tray over here.

294
00:18:20,410 --> 00:18:21,250
There's like,

295
00:18:22,240 --> 00:18:26,680
there's so much fucking like
misinformation. I don't know how to,

296
00:18:28,090 --> 00:18:31,630
I don't know how to sift through it.
And I don't want to become a vegetarian,

297
00:18:31,660 --> 00:18:35,680
you know what I mean? But I also fucking
hate working out, you know what I mean?

298
00:18:35,681 --> 00:18:39,060
So I would like to
fucking just eat smarter

299
00:18:39,920 --> 00:18:44,660
is what I'm trying to do, you know?
Now that I'm on the fucking road,

300
00:18:45,260 --> 00:18:49,910
this is what always gets me, you know,
I come in, I'm grumpy from a flight,

301
00:18:50,600 --> 00:18:50,961
you know,

302
00:18:50,961 --> 00:18:54,200
and you look at the salads and when
you're in a fucking bad mood and you're

303
00:18:54,201 --> 00:18:57,780
hungry, a salad never looks
like the right option, does it?

304
00:18:58,650 --> 00:19:00,390
It never does. What do you do? Yeah,

305
00:19:00,391 --> 00:19:04,760
I'm getting a fucking burger and you're
trying to say I want a side salad.

306
00:19:05,720 --> 00:19:09,200
And then the lady's like, do you want
fries with that? And then you had gone,

307
00:19:09,410 --> 00:19:09,950
no bill, don't. Yeah,

308
00:19:09,950 --> 00:19:12,440
do it. And then you can eat. Yeah, yeah.

309
00:19:12,510 --> 00:19:16,320
Fuck it. Give me some Goddamn fries. Okay

310
00:19:16,790 --> 00:19:20,570
Sir. You can order your food
without using that language.

311
00:19:20,750 --> 00:19:22,900
I like to remind you all you
are in the bottle, right?

312
00:19:23,250 --> 00:19:28,130
Yep. So I've been in Houston a thousand
times, so what am I supposed to do now?

313
00:19:28,190 --> 00:19:31,780
Am I going to go to the fucking Alamo
again? Going into that God forsaken.

314
00:19:31,990 --> 00:19:33,770
I've never even been in it.
You don't?

315
00:19:34,700 --> 00:19:38,300
And I'm not talking about the
original Alamo in San Antonio.

316
00:19:38,301 --> 00:19:41,530
I'm talking about the
Houston Alamo. It's a, uh,

317
00:19:42,830 --> 00:19:47,000
it's a mom and pop place.
You know, I don't know what
the fuck I'm talking about.

318
00:19:47,030 --> 00:19:48,980
I just wanted to just
say the different cities,

319
00:19:49,070 --> 00:19:52,360

could be all like [inaudible]

00:24:40,610 --> 00:24:45,610
Stitch fix has reimagined the
way we we find and buy clothes.

395
00:24:47,120 --> 00:24:48,620
First of all,
hats off to these guys.

396
00:24:48,621 --> 00:24:52,310
No Pun intended that they took the time
to figure out how to fix this boring

397
00:24:52,311 --> 00:24:56,870
problem. Um, we've reimagined
it like Disney convenience,

398

that life gets busy.

399
00:24:59,511 --> 00:25:02,780
So just tell them your sizes and your
favorite types of clothes and how much you

400
00:25:02,910 --> 00:25:06,920
want to spend and your personal stylist
will pick out your clothing for you

401
00:25:07,430 --> 00:25:09,770
based on your preferences.

like it, no worries. Just send it back.

Free of charge style. Some of
us have it, some of us don't.

404
00:25:17,210 --> 00:25:21,050
But just because a sense of style seems
elusive for some doesn't mean it's

405
00:25:21,051 --> 00:25:23,690
impossible to obtain to attain.
Sorry.

406
00:25:24,580 --> 00:25:28,070
There's no time like the present to
discover that style you never knew you had

and you can with a little help
from our friends at stitch fix.

408
00:25:31,430 --> 00:25:34,730
This is like when they would go into the
musical montage in any eighties movie

409
00:25:34,731 --> 00:25:38,000
when they would be like re
remaking the nerdy chick. You know,

410
00:25:38,120 --> 00:25:41,990
she wasn't good looking because she
wore glasses and had our hair up right.

411
00:25:42,050 --> 00:25:44,930
Then they'd let the hair down and take
the glasses off. It's like, oh my God,

412
00:25:44,931 --> 00:25:49,310
Megan, you're beautiful. This is what

And now they got them all warm
underneath the Napkin with some butter.

442
00:27:30,490 --> 00:27:33,250
And My mother taught me not to waste.
So what am I supposed to do here?

443
00:27:34,700 --> 00:27:35,533
Huh?

444
00:27:36,550 --> 00:27:41,140
I Dunno. Anyways, but I'm, I'm uh,
I'm liking the way I look right now.

445
00:27:41,141 --> 00:27:44,440
I get irritated. So I
would like to continue, uh,

446
00:27:45,760 --> 00:27:47,120
with the nok booze and for a while,

447
00:27:47,121 --> 00:27:50,410
I'm not going to do with like the
way I smoke cigars like a chimney.

448
00:27:51,010 --> 00:27:53,620
Now I'm going to drink the way I
smoke cigars, which is, you know,

449
00:27:53,710 --> 00:27:58,630
once every 10 minutes. No, once
every 10 to 14 days I have a cigar.

450
00:27:58,900 --> 00:28:03,900
So I would like to get hammered or have
a couple of cocktails twice a month.

451
00:28:04,421 --> 00:28:09,100
That's not bad. 24 times
a year, 24 times a year.

452
00:28:09,160 --> 00:28:13,100
I just want to remind my liver
that this is not a game. Okay.

453
00:28:16,060 --> 00:28:20,560
The preseason is over. All right. So
keep your head on a fucking swivel.

454
00:28:21,220 --> 00:28:25,350
Stay on you, God damn toes. Um, I like,

455
00:28:25,351 --> 00:28:28,270
I got a night coming up. I'm going
to come off the wagon for one day.

456
00:28:28,271 --> 00:28:30,730
Like what I would like to do, come up
to the wagon for one day in August,

457
00:28:31,180 --> 00:28:35,470
and then I am not going to drink again
until I'm going to a Michigan Wolverine

458
00:28:35,471 --> 00:28:37,580

Jay Jay,

461
00:28:39,750 --> 00:28:44,710
I have not been to a game there
since 1999 and the only guy,

462
00:28:44,740 --> 00:28:47,650
there was some guy in Michigan I believe
when the Heisman and I for some reason

463
00:28:47,651 --> 00:28:49,300
I remember that Guy David Boston,

464
00:28:49,660 --> 00:28:53,740
cause he had the last name Boston and
then he went to the charges or something

465
00:28:53,741 --> 00:28:57,650
like that. I can't remember.
But uh, I went to the uh,

466

big house. That's a, that's a good one.

482
00:30:02,260 --> 00:30:06,610

He did it cover of his freedom.
Um,

this artist is staring king and,

485
00:30:16,330 --> 00:30:20,560

drums with mute math. He plays guitar,

486
00:30:20,740 --> 00:30:22,570
he sings.
And from what I've heard,

487
00:30:22,571 --> 00:30:26,650
he's going to be maybe doing
a small tour coming up. Um,

00:31:32,070 --> 00:31:32,250
[inaudible] [inaudible]

495
00:31:32,250 --> 00:31:35,190
I got a break time in Vegas other
than when I went down to the pool,

496
00:31:36,030 --> 00:31:39,590
because I go down to the pool, I'm down
there to me, it's fucking j law had,

497
00:31:39,630 --> 00:31:42,340
who has been killing it
in front of me. And, uh,

498
00:31:42,360 --> 00:31:45,930
the lovely Nia and her cousins and
were, hang all right cousin. I mean,

499
00:31:45,980 --> 00:31:49,830
and we're hanging out, down the pool and
they're doing the usual shit, you know,

500
00:31:50,070 --> 00:31:52,080
if you're a redhead and
he'd go down to the pool,

501
00:31:53,040 --> 00:31:56,770
like you just asked it for people all,
you know,

502
00:31:56,970 --> 00:32:00,570
look how white you are. You
know, like, I never noticed.

503
00:32:00,571 --> 00:32:02,580
It's like I'm fucking around myself.

504
00:32:03,660 --> 00:32:06,900
I've been around myself since the sixties,
the late sixties.

505
00:32:06,930 --> 00:32:09,840
I know how white I am,
and if I ever forget how white I am,

506
00:32:10,080 --> 00:32:14,090
there's always somebody
there to remind me. Sorry,

507
00:32:14,091 --> 00:32:18,490
I don't know if you've noticed your
skin tone. What am I meditating?

508
00:32:18,491 --> 00:32:22,850
Floating up on my body? All right,
so these people up with go, c'mon,

509
00:32:22,860 --> 00:32:25,090
c'mon in the pool and like,
I don't want to go in the pool.

510
00:32:25,780 --> 00:32:28,810
I don't want to go on the fucking
pool. You know, they're like, why? No,

511
00:32:28,811 --> 00:32:31,800
why don't you want to go to the pool?
You know why? Because the fucking

512
00:32:34,000 --> 00:32:38,210
look at, look at these people, look at
them, look at them. And you're getting,

513
00:32:38,220 --> 00:32:41,390
you're getting your, you know,
would you take a bath with all,

514
00:32:41,391 --> 00:32:43,580
with any one of the
people that you see here,

515
00:32:43,610 --> 00:32:48,050
these fucking just masses of human beings.

516
00:32:48,170 --> 00:32:52,670
There's not enough chlorine in a fucking
pool to kill whatever the fuck they're

517
00:32:52,671 --> 00:32:55,280
dragging in the pool. You know, it's
like I finally end up going to the pool.

518
00:32:55,490 --> 00:32:59,690
Then everybody made fun of how white my
fucking alabaster chest was a da that I

519
00:32:59,691 --> 00:33:04,460
had to stay in the shade of the
fucking, uh, the lifeguard's chair,

520
00:33:05,270 --> 00:33:09,640
you know,
you know,

521
00:33:09,650 --> 00:33:13,580
I had a show to do, I'm
being a professional, I
can't come out stage later,

522
00:33:13,640 --> 00:33:17,420
half in the bag, looking
like a lot of stuff, right?

523
00:33:18,450 --> 00:33:22,980
I gotta do my little song and dance
later on that night. So, anyway,

524
00:33:22,981 --> 00:33:26,150
so I ended up getting in the fucking
pool against my, what I wanted to do,

525
00:33:26,330 --> 00:33:30,080
you know, and then I
get out of the pool. Uh,

526
00:33:30,450 --> 00:33:34,920
first of all for my age,
I am in absolutely phenomenal.

527
00:33:34,921 --> 00:33:38,370
Top shelf shape.
Alright.

528
00:33:39,450 --> 00:33:43,550
I gotta tell you the fucking,
just the stuff.

529
00:33:43,560 --> 00:33:48,560
Fuck the humanity that I
saw poolside in Las Vegas,

530
00:33:49,290 --> 00:33:51,570
the fucking humanity

531
00:33:54,250 --> 00:33:55,120
keyword manatee.

532
00:33:59,480 --> 00:34:00,313
Yeah.

533
00:34:00,630 --> 00:34:03,090
Not The skep step on a Jim Gaffigan.

534
00:34:03,540 --> 00:34:06,870
I just realized he used to use that
reference and I'm pretty sure he used it.

535
00:34:08,160 --> 00:34:09,720
I can't remember how the fuck he used it,

536
00:34:09,721 --> 00:34:14,120
but if he used it to
describe a fat Pale Torso,

537
00:34:14,160 --> 00:34:17,880
not really pale, but whatever, whatever
the fucking shit. I saw the side of the,

538
00:34:17,881 --> 00:34:22,160
he was dead on that.
Oh my God.

539
00:34:23,720 --> 00:34:28,130
Is there anything worse than seeing
a tattoo come of age? You know,

540
00:34:29,930 --> 00:34:32,000
Jesus Christ, if you get
a tattoo, you better.

541
00:34:32,030 --> 00:34:35,960
You better just make the mental decision
that you're going to p nine dx for the

542
00:34:35,961 --> 00:34:38,360
rest of your fucking life.
Cause when you don't do it,

543
00:34:38,361 --> 00:34:41,420
I saw this guy down at the pool.
All right.

544
00:34:42,740 --> 00:34:46,940
He had like not only the worst
tattoos you've ever seen in your life,

545
00:34:47,450 --> 00:34:50,660
like the worst placement,
you know what I mean?

546
00:34:51,170 --> 00:34:53,690
Like you get one like on the side
of your arm up by your shoulder,

547
00:34:53,691 --> 00:34:57,890
that looks good, right on the
bicep. That looks good. You know,

548
00:34:58,820 --> 00:35:00,260
geo,
somebody got gets one right over there.

549
00:35:01,160 --> 00:35:04,340
Voicebox like I don't give a fuck
what you have surrounding that.

550
00:35:04,341 --> 00:35:07,970
That leads into that part of the,
of the, of the work or the piece,

551
00:35:07,971 --> 00:35:12,950
whatever they call it. It looks fucking
horrible. Leg Tattoos, horrific,

552
00:35:13,760 --> 00:35:16,400
horrific.
So this fucking jerk off.

553
00:35:17,090 --> 00:35:20,960
He has basically the exact sort of
like tribal thing that the rock has,

554
00:35:22,310 --> 00:35:26,510
except he doesn't look tribal. He
looks like an accountant, you know,

555
00:35:27,590 --> 00:35:29,660
and he doesn't work out.

556
00:35:30,050 --> 00:35:33,910
So just imagine if the
rock was his pasty as I was

557
00:35:36,650 --> 00:35:38,250
and it never worked down in his life.

558
00:35:38,251 --> 00:35:41,760
But he has that same tattoo that
starts at the elbow, goes up the arm,

559
00:35:41,761 --> 00:35:44,520
over the shoulder and
covers one whole peck.

560
00:35:44,970 --> 00:35:49,410
But the way this guy had it done was
it didn't cover his whole packet,

561
00:35:49,411 --> 00:35:53,070
came swinging in and went right above his,
his man nipple.

562
00:35:53,640 --> 00:35:56,370
So now all of the,
all of that is like colored in.

563
00:35:57,360 --> 00:36:00,720
So because of the pasting as of his torso,

564
00:36:01,020 --> 00:36:03,960
your eye is just drawn
to his right nipple.

565
00:36:06,420 --> 00:36:07,253
Yeah.

566
00:36:07,600 --> 00:36:09,760
Is he standing in the fucking pool?

567
00:36:11,020 --> 00:36:13,930
My neck was sore from shaking
my head at people. It was,

568
00:36:14,080 --> 00:36:17,890
it was absolutely fucking
horrific. Right? So, so anyways,

569
00:36:19,510 --> 00:36:24,100
um, I go back up to the, uh, I go back
up to the hotel room. Right? You know,

570
00:36:24,950 --> 00:36:29,050
you gotta make sure that I'm all shipshape
from my goddamn show and I put on the

571
00:36:29,051 --> 00:36:32,470
news and what do they end
up doing a story about?

572
00:36:33,250 --> 00:36:37,420
They start doing a story
about the amount of, uh,

573
00:36:38,350 --> 00:36:41,830
fecal matter found in public pools

574
00:36:44,650 --> 00:36:47,950
right after I just got out of a God pool.
You know,

575
00:36:47,951 --> 00:36:51,310
and I know what people always think,
oh, stay away from where the kids are.

576
00:36:52,000 --> 00:36:54,610
Stay away from the Kitty Pool.
Right. Stay away from that.

577
00:36:54,611 --> 00:36:56,500
They always blamed the fucking kids.
Will I,

578
00:36:56,501 --> 00:37:00,610
you know something after seeing
what I saw poolside, you know,

579
00:37:00,730 --> 00:37:03,580
there weren't a lot of kids in there,
but I guarantee you

580
00:37:05,080 --> 00:37:07,940
somebody's got a cola. I know this is
fucking disgusting. But people you've,

581
00:37:07,950 --> 00:37:12,330
you're basically bathing, you
don't see even more fucked up. His,

582
00:37:12,550 --> 00:37:16,420
his Vegas is just like, you know,
people fly in from all over the world.

583
00:37:16,660 --> 00:37:21,620
You're taking a fucking aids bath,
you know, with a shot of fucking,

584
00:37:21,870 --> 00:37:23,590
ah,
what the hell was that shit that came out,

585
00:37:23,591 --> 00:37:25,960
but to kill people so fast
that it just burned out.

586
00:37:26,560 --> 00:37:30,610
Everybody just ran into the woods.
The fuck was that shit called.

587
00:37:32,730 --> 00:37:35,440
Oh Christ.
I can't remember a bola.

588
00:37:36,370 --> 00:37:40,680
That's it with a shot
of Ebola or whatever.

589
00:37:40,681 --> 00:37:43,800
Food poisoning. I don't know what
it is. A salmon, Ellis shower,

590
00:37:43,830 --> 00:37:46,980
whatever the fuck you want to call it.
I'm done with public pools.

591
00:37:46,981 --> 00:37:50,220
The only pool that I will ever
swimming again is my pool.

592
00:37:50,340 --> 00:37:54,450
If I ever get one or the pool of some
hot chick that I want to fucking bang

593
00:37:54,630 --> 00:37:57,540
cause I have Nias permission.
That's the only way it's going to go down.

594
00:37:57,720 --> 00:38:01,350
Other than that, you know, I'll
just go, I'll just go take a bath.

595
00:38:05,910 --> 00:38:06,210
Yeah.
That

596
00:38:06,210 --> 00:38:10,620
way I'm out of the sun. You know,
we'll take a couple of vitamin E pills,

597
00:38:10,621 --> 00:38:14,130
whatever the fuck it is you get from
the sun, other than skin cancer,

598
00:38:14,580 --> 00:38:15,413
I'm done with it.

599
00:38:16,620 --> 00:38:21,620
You know what America needs to implement
after years and years of calling the

600
00:38:21,721 --> 00:38:24,180
French people smelly.
You know?

601
00:38:24,210 --> 00:38:28,110
That's Kinda like the thing when we went
over to France and save their ass for

602
00:38:28,111 --> 00:38:32,400
the second time last century. Oh wait, did
we do it once? We did it one time, right?

603
00:38:32,970 --> 00:38:35,830
I can't fucking remember.
So anyways,

604
00:38:36,260 --> 00:38:38,500
we always made fun of the French father.
They smell.

605
00:38:38,501 --> 00:38:42,520
If you ever watched a bugs bunny
growing up, man, you saw pepe Le Pew.

606
00:38:42,580 --> 00:38:45,190
If you noticed he had a French accent,
you know,

607
00:38:45,220 --> 00:38:48,190
that's the kind of shit you couldn't
get away with today because of political

608
00:38:48,191 --> 00:38:51,820
correctness. I guess they were basically
saying that you know that they stunk.

609
00:38:52,180 --> 00:38:57,180
But I'll tell you one thing would that
the French have when it comes to hygiene

610
00:38:57,550 --> 00:39:00,790
over Americans, all right? Is the big day.

611
00:39:02,300 --> 00:39:06,250
All right? I can guarantee you if I
ever go swimming in a public pool again,

612
00:39:06,251 --> 00:39:07,190
it's going to be good friends.

613
00:39:11,370 --> 00:39:14,110
Ellis is a bunch of Americans are,
I know, I've been over to England,

614
00:39:14,111 --> 00:39:16,720
I never saw but day over there,
you know,

615
00:39:17,920 --> 00:39:22,630
but day is basically a car
wash for your asshole Ed. Uh,

616
00:39:23,110 --> 00:39:25,870
you know,
it leaves you feeling refreshed,

617
00:39:26,230 --> 00:39:30,760
puts a fucking smile on your face and
evidently had French is so fucking happy.

618
00:39:30,761 --> 00:39:31,440
You forget.
Yeah,

619
00:39:31,440 --> 00:39:34,250
put on Deodorant. But I'll tell you
right now, you can jump in that pool.

620
00:39:34,251 --> 00:39:36,920
I bet the next debt back then I'm
talking about that shit over there.

621
00:39:59,840 --> 00:40:00,673
[inaudible]

622
00:40:12,490 --> 00:40:13,323
pen

623
00:40:37,650 --> 00:40:38,483
not chose.

624
00:40:59,430 --> 00:41:00,263
[inaudible]

625
00:41:02,190 --> 00:41:07,050
Hey, how are ya? It's built bar and it is
the Monday morning podcasts from Monday,

626
00:41:10,800 --> 00:41:15,030
July 26th, 2010 look at that
Honda last Monday in July,

627
00:41:15,330 --> 00:41:19,560
another summer month flying by.
And once again there they are,

628
00:41:19,561 --> 00:41:23,400
the goddamn bank or cuts
just staring you in the face,

629
00:41:24,090 --> 00:41:25,380
sticking their hands out there.

630
00:41:25,381 --> 00:41:30,060
A little grubby fucking hands asking
for another pound of flesh as they do at

631
00:41:30,061 --> 00:41:30,990
the end of every month.

632
00:41:30,991 --> 00:41:34,670
Don't they actually talked to a buddy
mine who outside the business and got a

633
00:41:34,671 --> 00:41:39,350
check the other day, right? And was,
you know, bitching about the taxes.

634
00:41:39,710 --> 00:41:43,790
I talking about all the taxes taken
out and he goes, thanks a lot Obama,

635
00:41:45,050 --> 00:41:45,883
you know,

636
00:41:45,950 --> 00:41:50,950
and then I get into a fucking argument
trying to get this dude to stop blaming

637
00:41:53,361 --> 00:41:55,070
the standing fucking president.

638
00:41:56,030 --> 00:42:00,140
You got to get to the fucking guys
who put put, put the dude in there.

639
00:42:00,170 --> 00:42:05,000
Not even put the dude in there but
can take the dude out. You know,

640
00:42:06,040 --> 00:42:10,160
doesn't fucking make a difference. I
remember I voted for Ron Paul. You know,

641
00:42:10,161 --> 00:42:14,030
I always vote for those guys.
Ralph Nader's and all that.

642
00:42:14,031 --> 00:42:15,740
The Ross Perot's and everybody always,

643
00:42:15,970 --> 00:42:19,640
they always tells me it's a fucking
waste of a vote. Is it though?

644
00:42:20,120 --> 00:42:24,260
You tell me one fucking thing different
that Obama's doing that McCain wouldn't

645
00:42:24,261 --> 00:42:27,560
be doing. I know there's little subtle
differences, you know, he's going to,

646
00:42:27,980 --> 00:42:29,900
rather than giving it to the fucking rich,

647
00:42:29,901 --> 00:42:34,490
he's going to give it to the fucking
poor. You know, both their philosophy suck

648
00:42:36,080 --> 00:42:40,160
and I'll in bankers just keep
getting richer and fucking richer.

649
00:42:41,460 --> 00:42:44,980
It just, it just blows my mind.
You know, it's one thing I've,

650
00:42:44,981 --> 00:42:49,310
I've learned finally figured out over
all this shit, that whole rich guy,

651
00:42:49,490 --> 00:42:52,970
we'll give it to the rich and they'll
create jobs and it'll trickle down.

652
00:42:52,971 --> 00:42:55,550
The keyword is trickle and we're all
going to be sitting there with their

653
00:42:55,551 --> 00:43:00,110
tongues. Ah, Eh, trying to catch
a drop of fucking prosperity.

654
00:43:00,650 --> 00:43:04,910
And then on the other side,
if you just give people shit,

655
00:43:05,240 --> 00:43:09,950
you don't help them. They come back
the next day like a fucking cat,

656
00:43:10,430 --> 00:43:13,280
you know, waiting for another
bowl of milk. It's like, no dude,

657
00:43:13,400 --> 00:43:17,030
I was trying to give you nourishment
so you could go fucking, you know,

658
00:43:17,090 --> 00:43:20,480
have enough strength to go milk a cow
wherever the fuck you supposed to do. Oh,

659
00:43:20,481 --> 00:43:22,700
I didn't know.
I don't you going to give a dog.

660
00:43:22,701 --> 00:43:27,290
This is where I get the free milk from.
All right Dan, I get the fuck out of here.

661
00:43:28,610 --> 00:43:32,810
Fucking piece of shit.
You know, anybody got a,

662
00:43:32,920 --> 00:43:37,400
I've got a got a bomb for a
friend always asking for money.

663
00:43:37,480 --> 00:43:38,061
Do you ever do that?

664
00:43:38,061 --> 00:43:41,840
And you're doing well in your life and
you feel guilty and they get themselves

665
00:43:41,841 --> 00:43:46,370
into a jam. Man, I'm in
a fucking jam, you know,

666
00:43:46,490 --> 00:43:47,780
and it's everybody's fucking fault.

667
00:43:47,781 --> 00:43:52,280
But theirs and their girls got them on
the outs and the cops fucking arrested

668
00:43:52,640 --> 00:43:56,270
'em and air. They're going to put
them in fucking jail. You know,

669
00:43:56,271 --> 00:43:57,680
or whatever's going to happen.

670
00:43:57,890 --> 00:44:02,150
They're going to take their fucking car
and they need 500 bucks and you fucking

671
00:44:02,151 --> 00:44:05,300
give it to him, right? What do you do?

672
00:44:05,301 --> 00:44:09,740
They get out of that jam for fucking 10
minutes and what within a month they're

673
00:44:09,741 --> 00:44:12,830
in another fucking jam if
they learned anything. No,

674
00:44:12,980 --> 00:44:15,620
and a lot of times it's
an even worse predicament.

675
00:44:15,650 --> 00:44:18,740
I'm going to stop saying jam
like I'm in the fucking seventies

676
00:44:21,060 --> 00:44:23,450
started off me doing the character.
I'm in a jam.

677
00:44:23,451 --> 00:44:25,700
And then I just started saying it is me.

678
00:44:25,880 --> 00:44:29,660
And I felt like fucking the dude who
drives the mystery machine on Scooby Doo.

679
00:44:30,780 --> 00:44:32,100
I say that he was too much

680
00:44:32,100 --> 00:44:35,840
of a square, right?
Fucking the hot chicken,

681
00:44:35,870 --> 00:44:40,580
the missionary position.
Am I really doing Scooby Doo jokes?

682
00:44:41,240 --> 00:44:45,320
Um, the fuck was his name.
Was it Fred with his ascot?

683
00:44:46,670 --> 00:44:49,010
That's all I'm saying, dude.
It's all fucking bullshit.

684
00:44:49,100 --> 00:44:53,630
I believe there's plenty of fucking money
if these fucking banker assholes will

685
00:44:53,631 --> 00:44:58,280
stop taking all of it in
these corporations. I Dunno.
Does it, does it really cost?

686
00:44:59,000 --> 00:45:02,180
Well, it really costs like
fucking 40 bucks a tee shirt.

687
00:45:02,690 --> 00:45:05,090
If you pay somebody a
decent wage to make it,

688
00:45:05,350 --> 00:45:10,010
they really got to have some eight year
old make $3 a fucking day, you know,

689
00:45:10,790 --> 00:45:15,590
isn't there a of fucking
middle ground? Yeah, I,

690
00:45:15,591 --> 00:45:16,424
I don't get it.

691
00:45:16,470 --> 00:45:20,430
I just don't get it. I, I just refused.
I don't blame politicians anymore.

692
00:45:20,730 --> 00:45:24,870
Democrat or Republican. I
just don't fucking blame him
anymore. It's an absolute,

693
00:45:25,710 --> 00:45:27,280
it's a fucking shit storm.
And look at,

694
00:45:27,281 --> 00:45:29,910
look at a shitstorm Obama came
walking into, that's like, yeah,

695
00:45:30,090 --> 00:45:34,140
you're hosting one of those hoarders
shows and you walk into the house and it's

696
00:45:34,141 --> 00:45:38,280
just piled high was shit.
Trillions of fucking

697
00:45:39,060 --> 00:45:42,210
things that need to be thrown
out. Right? And then what?

698
00:45:42,211 --> 00:45:45,840
You give the guy 10 minutes to clean out
the fucking house and then after that

699
00:45:45,841 --> 00:45:48,300
it's his mess.
Look at a fucking mess you made.

700
00:45:50,180 --> 00:45:54,050
I don't fucking know. I gotta I gotta
admit like politics is just like baseball.

701
00:45:54,051 --> 00:45:57,080
I stopped watching in June of last year,
you know,

702
00:45:57,081 --> 00:45:58,820
although I'm starting
to come around again,

703
00:46:00,210 --> 00:46:02,500
I'm coming back around
to baseball and I'm, um,

704
00:46:03,300 --> 00:46:06,630
I'm in the nationals and I'm
liking the Pittsburgh pirates.

705
00:46:07,080 --> 00:46:10,770
I'm coming back into the fucking backdoor.
All right,

706
00:46:11,880 --> 00:46:16,380
going, I'm going down to tier three.
I'm bored shitless with Yankees,

707
00:46:16,381 --> 00:46:20,400
red sox. I got to at, I'm fucking burned
out and burned out with this shit.

708
00:46:20,401 --> 00:46:22,780
It's just like whatever.
We won the fucking world series.

709
00:46:22,920 --> 00:46:25,680
Then we want another one that's the
end of the movie. Roll the credits.

710
00:46:26,430 --> 00:46:27,990
I got to fucking try to give a shit.

711
00:46:28,080 --> 00:46:31,470
They act like I give a fuck
12 times a goddamn year.

712
00:46:33,810 --> 00:46:38,160
Um, I don't know. Yeah, but I don't
watch politics either. Um, I just, uh,

713
00:46:39,270 --> 00:46:41,940
and those though, those political
fucking shows on TV, I just,

714
00:46:41,970 --> 00:46:44,660
I can't get into them because,
uh,

715
00:46:44,900 --> 00:46:49,700
there's nobody really taken the people
that I feel need to be taken to task.

716
00:46:49,760 --> 00:46:53,240
And at the end of the day,
the people I feel need to be taken to task

717
00:46:54,950 --> 00:46:59,630
are, uh, it's, it's all based on
shit I watched on youtube, you know,

718
00:46:59,631 --> 00:47:00,850
so who the fuck am I?
Right,

719
00:47:00,870 --> 00:47:04,590
bitch. So I just tapped out. I
just said, you know what? Fuck it.

720
00:47:05,920 --> 00:47:08,200
Fuck it.
I'm going to get myself a bear.

721
00:47:09,150 --> 00:47:12,330
Okay. You know, maybe get a pistol.
Learn how to shoot the fucking thing.

722
00:47:12,870 --> 00:47:14,760
You know what a beer sounds
really good right now.

723
00:47:15,420 --> 00:47:17,670
If I ever drank a beer
on the fucking podcast,

724
00:47:18,330 --> 00:47:21,240
I think I'm going to think I'm
going to go fucking get one.

725
00:47:22,350 --> 00:47:25,260
Do I got time to go run and get it? You
know what? It's not one of those bears.

726
00:47:25,261 --> 00:47:28,710
You can really drink out of a fucking
can you get a pour it into a glass

727
00:47:29,890 --> 00:47:33,370
and I, you know what? I have the ability
to hit pause, don't I? I really do.

728
00:47:33,670 --> 00:47:37,840
Let me see if I know how to do it
here. Ah, Jesus. This is always tough.

729
00:47:37,841 --> 00:47:41,380
Do I hit play? Oh, I
hit record. Hit record.

730
00:47:43,370 --> 00:47:45,910
All right.
And with the magic of the pause button,

731
00:47:45,911 --> 00:47:48,580
I am back and I got a fucking
brew right in front of me.

732
00:47:50,020 --> 00:47:53,260
Huck too is what I'm doing.
I don't give a shit anymore.

733
00:47:53,350 --> 00:47:57,550
I gave a fuck and a all you end
up doing it. You just start.

734
00:47:57,551 --> 00:48:02,410
You just start yelling at people in
bars. That's all given a fuck. Get you.

735
00:48:03,160 --> 00:48:06,010
You know what are you gonna make a sign?

736
00:48:08,380 --> 00:48:12,790
Staying on some street corner.
Honk. If you give a fuck, that's,

737
00:48:12,791 --> 00:48:17,620
that's going to stop the banks.
You can't do it. I quit. I give up.

738
00:48:17,680 --> 00:48:21,070
I don't give a shit.
Just tell me what to believe.

739
00:48:21,940 --> 00:48:24,700
I don't fucking care anymore.
I want to get a gun though.

740
00:48:24,730 --> 00:48:29,440
I really do stand on my fucking
porch waving it at people.

741
00:48:29,680 --> 00:48:34,090
Just be that guy. We always knew who
he was going to be a problem. I mean,

742
00:48:34,180 --> 00:48:38,680
you had a gun. I got a gun too. What?
I'm responsible. I'll keep it in. Uh,

743
00:48:38,681 --> 00:48:43,540
keeping him a safe that way.
If somebody breaks in, uh,

744
00:48:43,600 --> 00:48:46,420
I go, can you wait a second? I've
never understood that. You know,

745
00:48:46,421 --> 00:48:49,660
it's like if you're going to
have a fucking gun, you know,

746
00:48:50,170 --> 00:48:52,660
to really protect yourself,
don't you have to sleep with it?

747
00:48:52,661 --> 00:48:57,661
Like fucking Tony Soprano in the second
to last episode on the Soprano's when

748
00:48:57,791 --> 00:49:02,710
you thought this Tony Montana ending
was going to happen and then it didn't.

749
00:49:03,430 --> 00:49:05,440
I don't get tissue.
Keep it in the gun safe.

750
00:49:05,560 --> 00:49:08,560
And then you keep the bullets
in the trunk of your car, right?

751
00:49:08,561 --> 00:49:12,070
You keep the scope up in the attic,
you know,

752
00:49:15,910 --> 00:49:19,060
as, as the intruders chasing
you around your fucking house,

753
00:49:19,070 --> 00:49:21,700
you grabbing different parts of the gun,
assembling it,

754
00:49:23,000 --> 00:49:24,750
stick it under your fucking pillowcase.

755
00:49:24,790 --> 00:49:27,070
Like Beretta is not what
you're supposed to do.

756
00:49:29,440 --> 00:49:31,690
You know what?
I've never owned a nightstand in my life.

757
00:49:32,050 --> 00:49:35,590
I'm going to get a gun too. This is a, I
should have done this on the 4th of July.

758
00:49:36,310 --> 00:49:37,540
I'm doing a podcast.

759
00:49:37,541 --> 00:49:40,420
I'm talking about getting a gun and I'm
drinking a fucking beer and I one of

760
00:49:40,421 --> 00:49:41,111
those pussy ones.

761
00:49:41,111 --> 00:49:46,111
Either he's a fucking s one
pint Boddington's pub Ale.

762
00:49:46,990 --> 00:49:49,450
You know one of those ones,
you open it up and it's got that fucking,

763
00:49:49,451 --> 00:49:50,440
I don't know what it has in there.

764
00:49:50,441 --> 00:49:53,800
That metal ball that rattles around
you look in, you can never find it.

765
00:49:54,520 --> 00:49:55,780
They had no idea what it is,

766
00:49:55,870 --> 00:49:59,880
but for some reason you never had the
curiosity enough to fucking gut the can to

767
00:49:59,881 --> 00:50:03,130
see what it looks like. I like the
mystery. I like the mystery of it.

768
00:50:04,300 --> 00:50:05,133
I don't know what it is.

769
00:50:05,800 --> 00:50:08,440
Isn't it weird how a fucking beer
like quenches your thirst and then

770
00:50:08,441 --> 00:50:12,960
automatically makes you thirsty again
once the deal is or cools, it's, Ooh,

771
00:50:13,730 --> 00:50:17,170
Ooh. Um, speaking of guns,

772
00:50:18,920 --> 00:50:22,390
Oh, what'd you guys do? If I just got
absolutely shit faced on this podcast,

773
00:50:22,500 --> 00:50:24,760
I'd feel great and I wouldn't even
think that I had a drinking problem.

774
00:50:25,090 --> 00:50:28,340
I can just keep hitting pause.
You guys wouldn't even know.

775
00:50:28,520 --> 00:50:32,420
And technically because I'm talking to
you. I'm not drinking alone. All right?

776
00:50:33,710 --> 00:50:36,830
Isn't that what George Thorogood went
off the fucking rails when he did that

777
00:50:36,831 --> 00:50:40,250
song. I drink alone. The adweek Lune

778
00:50:41,770 --> 00:50:45,240
rally and he started putting on the weight
and he still wear those rattle snake

779
00:50:45,800 --> 00:50:50,110
skin fucking pants with matching top,
you know, at some point, I mean, dude, I,

780
00:50:50,111 --> 00:50:54,050
I should fucking talk.
I should really talk with my fucking,

781
00:50:55,070 --> 00:50:56,870
my God Damn Ma round.

782
00:50:57,530 --> 00:51:02,060
Smooth white belly is fucking beer at
Goddamn quarter to nine at night's not

783
00:51:02,061 --> 00:51:05,000
going to help.
At least it's hot as fuck in here.

784
00:51:05,001 --> 00:51:10,001
You know my old bastard fucking
neighbor downstairs is home and I like,

785
00:51:10,401 --> 00:51:14,150
I bring my voice down because
I don't need the bullshit.

786
00:51:14,540 --> 00:51:18,950
I can't fucking wait. You know, I got
a new special coming out. All right,

787
00:51:18,951 --> 00:51:23,951
it's coming out in September and I get
a fail on this going to fucking hit and

788
00:51:24,021 --> 00:51:27,920
it's going to hit hard and I'm finally
going to go out and buy a gun damn house

789
00:51:27,921 --> 00:51:32,921
out here and a day I do when I
load up that fucking you all right.

790
00:51:32,961 --> 00:51:34,820
You liked that. Even though I'm
dreaming about buying a house,

791
00:51:34,821 --> 00:51:38,270
I'm still a broke ass hole and I have to
move my shit myself when I load up that

792
00:51:38,271 --> 00:51:40,580
you all okay?

793
00:51:40,790 --> 00:51:44,990
And I bring that fucking tailgate
down one last time. All the way down.

794
00:51:44,991 --> 00:51:47,660
That little fucking he little bumper,

795
00:51:47,690 --> 00:51:51,770
that's only an inch off the ground to
make it easier for pussies like me to load

796
00:51:51,771 --> 00:51:54,560
their bureau in there.
You know,

797
00:51:55,730 --> 00:51:59,810
I'm going to ring his doorbell and I'm
going to get in his face and be like,

798
00:51:59,811 --> 00:52:03,440
listen old man.
I don't know when.

799
00:52:04,910 --> 00:52:07,220
I don't know how,
but I'm going to fucking get back.

800
00:52:07,550 --> 00:52:10,450
I'm going to do something to you.
I don't know what the fuck I'm gonna I,

801
00:52:10,451 --> 00:52:13,100
you know I sound, I sound like
fucking jumping Jeff Farmer right now.

802
00:52:13,610 --> 00:52:16,340
I'm coming at you full force.

803
00:52:18,500 --> 00:52:22,280
You turn the tables on me
in the wrong way. Old Man.

804
00:52:24,140 --> 00:52:26,480
No, I don't know. I, I can I, you
know, I don't do the revenge thing.

805
00:52:26,481 --> 00:52:29,870
I told you that guys a long time
ago. I don't do it. You know,

806
00:52:29,900 --> 00:52:32,360
if I wasn't so worried that
he'd have a heart attack,

807
00:52:32,361 --> 00:52:36,530
I really want to scare him one day.
Just do a fake sneeze,

808
00:52:36,531 --> 00:52:40,160
right close to him,
make them shit his pants a little bit,

809
00:52:42,020 --> 00:52:45,470
you know, take a Geritol shit
and it's fucking Dickies.

810
00:52:46,160 --> 00:52:49,370
Miserable bastard
really is.

811
00:52:49,371 --> 00:52:53,750
He's really the fucking ghost of a, was
it future? Was that the one that was, uh,

812
00:52:53,900 --> 00:52:56,840
I dunno what the fuck he is.
All right, let's move on here.

813
00:52:56,841 --> 00:52:59,090
I talked about getting a gun and so on.
And this is a thing too,

814
00:52:59,091 --> 00:53:03,260
because I'm doing this
podcast so early in the week,

815
00:53:05,450 --> 00:53:08,080
um, you know, I, I actually,

816
00:53:08,160 --> 00:53:10,460
I went through a bunch of
old emails and you know,

817
00:53:10,461 --> 00:53:13,100
I get a ton of emails
from you guys and uh,

818
00:53:13,160 --> 00:53:15,320
and I know sometimes people get
upset when I don't read them.

819
00:53:15,321 --> 00:53:19,100
I just get a ton of emails, but I just
went back because it's only Thursday.

820
00:53:19,101 --> 00:53:21,500
So I didn't really have that
many current ones. And I, uh,

821
00:53:21,501 --> 00:53:26,370
I saw some gems that I missed.
And I guess one week I was talking

822
00:53:26,370 --> 00:53:30,150
about the amount of people that
Stalin had killed. Verse Hitler.

823
00:53:30,570 --> 00:53:33,990
And how come people when they bring
up evil, they don't talk more about

824
00:53:35,610 --> 00:53:36,510
Yosef Stalin considering it,

825
00:53:36,570 --> 00:53:40,770
it seems to me that he killed like
three times plus a little bit more.

826
00:53:42,120 --> 00:53:46,110
I mean what, what, what exactly
are Hitler's uh, exact numbers?

827
00:53:46,320 --> 00:53:49,980
Cause I know the says that they killed
six on 6 million, 600. Jesus Christ,

828
00:53:50,250 --> 00:53:54,510
6 million Jewish people.
But I also know that he killed gaze.

829
00:53:54,720 --> 00:53:59,370
He killed, uh, uh, I think he killed
blacks. If there's only blacks in Germany.

830
00:54:01,170 --> 00:54:06,150
Um, maybe some Catholics,
I dunno, whatever. Traders,

831
00:54:06,180 --> 00:54:08,490
people who helped out Jewish
people. I mean, what do, I mean,

832
00:54:08,640 --> 00:54:10,530
did he get another fucking
million out of that?

833
00:54:11,190 --> 00:54:13,470
I don't know what his exact number is,
but I'm pretty safe.

834
00:54:13,471 --> 00:54:17,610
It's pretty safe to say that it's
under 10 million. So I was saying like,

835
00:54:17,611 --> 00:54:20,790
you know, Joseph Yosef Style and know
where the fuck you said it. You know this,

836
00:54:20,791 --> 00:54:22,950
this son of a bitch killed
like twice as many of that.

837
00:54:22,951 --> 00:54:25,080
If he give Hitler 10 million.
All right.

838
00:54:26,220 --> 00:54:28,800
So that was basically what I
was riffing on. So this game,

839
00:54:28,860 --> 00:54:33,840
this game made a great point. He
actually wrote to me and he said, um,

840
00:54:34,140 --> 00:54:37,020
I ran across something I thought
you might find interesting. Uh,

841
00:54:37,021 --> 00:54:40,680
I know you how you talk about Hitler
versus Mussolini Versus Stalin and the

842
00:54:40,681 --> 00:54:43,770
number of drug deaths attributed
to each one of them. Well,

843
00:54:43,771 --> 00:54:46,470
I don't think they actually
did much of the dirty work.

844
00:54:46,860 --> 00:54:51,030
They outsourced it to a Indian kids
who did it for half the price. Hahaha.

845
00:54:51,031 --> 00:54:53,970
And it's actually a decent joke.
If I read it better, I'm seriously,

846
00:54:53,971 --> 00:54:56,190
they had it done and they
didn't do it themselves.

847
00:54:56,191 --> 00:55:00,840
So thinking about the fact that they
didn't do much of the dirty work got me

848
00:55:00,841 --> 00:55:05,130
thinking about who did the dirty work
for themselves. After a little research,

849
00:55:05,160 --> 00:55:07,050
I came across,
uh,

850
00:55:07,051 --> 00:55:12,051
the person who I think was the baddest
motherfucker of World War Two and a,

851
00:55:14,491 --> 00:55:18,160
I love the suspense. He builds
up. Was He from the u s no.

852
00:55:18,600 --> 00:55:23,490
Was He from Germany? Ah. Was
He from England? No Cigar.

853
00:55:23,730 --> 00:55:26,760
Mother fucker. Was He from
Finland? Finland, fuck yeah.

854
00:55:27,730 --> 00:55:29,820
Does evidently do was from Finland.
The guy's name was,

855
00:55:29,821 --> 00:55:34,000
and I'm going to butcher this because even
the, the, the phonetic pronunciation, I,

856
00:55:34,001 --> 00:55:37,860
I don't know how to say the guy's
name. Uh, maybe anybody in Finland.

857
00:55:39,510 --> 00:55:43,450
And what's a fuck is in, is that
Helsinki? I have no fucking idea. Uh, um,

858
00:55:44,520 --> 00:55:49,320
CMO. Hey Ha. I don't know how the
fuck to say. My best attempt at the,

859
00:55:49,350 --> 00:55:53,670
at the pronunciation of the last name is,
what did he say?

860
00:55:53,671 --> 00:55:56,010
How high as in hat head,

861
00:55:56,880 --> 00:56:00,910
how Ha Cmo, how hair, I don't know.

862
00:56:01,680 --> 00:56:02,071
Anyways,

863
00:56:02,071 --> 00:56:06,180
he was nickname white death due to the
fact that he would operate in the snow

864
00:56:06,480 --> 00:56:10,830
and at a completely white uniform so
he couldn't be seen. All right, let's,

865
00:56:10,831 --> 00:56:13,620
let's go onto the Wikipedia. Let me read
about this guy. The first thing you know,

866
00:56:13,621 --> 00:56:17,610
if you look at, look at, look,
this guy up, it's s. I. M o h.

867
00:56:17,611 --> 00:56:21,960
A. Y. H.

868
00:56:21,960 --> 00:56:25,840
A M live to be a 96 years old.
All right.

869
00:56:27,150 --> 00:56:32,150
Nicknamed the white death by the Russians
is highest recorded number of kills.

870
00:56:33,101 --> 00:56:36,100
He was a sniper was 505.

871
00:56:36,101 --> 00:56:41,101
He has the highest recorded number
of kills 505 kills in any major war.

872
00:56:42,600 --> 00:56:47,110
All right. Uh, before entering
combat, he was a farmer and a hunter.

873
00:56:47,350 --> 00:56:51,160
His farmhouse was reportedly full
of trophies for marksmanship.

874
00:56:51,880 --> 00:56:55,510
So I guess he was a natural, he was kinda
like the Wayne Gretzky of killing shit.

875
00:56:55,511 --> 00:56:58,480
Right. Um, it was during war, the world,

876
00:56:58,510 --> 00:57:03,510
the winter war in 1939 to 1940
between Finland and the Soviet Union.

877
00:57:04,120 --> 00:57:08,500
Isn't that interesting? Interesting.
They call it the winter war. Um,

878
00:57:08,800 --> 00:57:12,430
or maybe that was an aspect of World
War II. I have no idea. Anyways,

879
00:57:12,431 --> 00:57:13,450
the winter war,
uh,

880
00:57:13,570 --> 00:57:18,570
that he began his duty as a sniper and
fought for the Finnish army against the

881
00:57:19,090 --> 00:57:24,090
Red Army and temperatures of minus
40 and minus 20 degrees Celsius.

882
00:57:24,850 --> 00:57:28,390
So what's that like 80 degrees Fahrenheit?
I have no idea. It's fucking cold out.

883
00:57:29,140 --> 00:57:33,550
Um, dress completely in white camouflage.
Hey Ha, whatever the fuck his call,

884
00:57:33,640 --> 00:57:35,770
his name. Hey Ya. Uh,

885
00:57:35,771 --> 00:57:40,240
was credited with 505 confirmed
kills of Soviet soldiers.

886
00:57:41,710 --> 00:57:45,100
542 unconfirmed.
If unconfirmed deaths are included,

887
00:57:45,101 --> 00:57:49,170
the unofficial finished frontline
figure with the battlefield,

888
00:57:49,240 --> 00:57:54,240
battlefield of Cola places the
number of his kills at over 800

889
00:57:56,470 --> 00:58:00,700
cause I guess he also had a submachine
gun and people give them credit for

890
00:58:00,701 --> 00:58:02,350
killing another 200 people,

891
00:58:03,550 --> 00:58:07,240
thus bringing his credits up
to at least 705 remarkably,

892
00:58:07,241 --> 00:58:08,200
this is the biggest thing here.

893
00:58:08,410 --> 00:58:13,410
This mother fucker did this in fewer
than a hundred days with very limited

894
00:58:14,291 --> 00:58:18,400
amount of daylight per day.
So he just sort of woke up,

895
00:58:19,600 --> 00:58:22,090
I guess. You know, he's killing
like seven people a day.

896
00:58:22,950 --> 00:58:25,840
If he's up for 16 hours
once every couple hours.

897
00:58:28,630 --> 00:58:30,700
Uh, what else can I
say about this guy? Um,

898
00:58:32,140 --> 00:58:36,160
I missed the part where he got to formed
part of the way through there. He was a,

899
00:58:40,700 --> 00:58:44,920
I'm gonna fuck is it now?
The tech to hae a was to compact the snow.

900
00:58:44,921 --> 00:58:48,730
You can pack the snow in front of him so
that the shot wouldn't disturb the snow

901
00:58:48,940 --> 00:58:50,350
and reveal his position.

902
00:58:50,680 --> 00:58:55,680
He also kept snow in his mouth so that
when breathing this steam would not give

903
00:58:56,141 --> 00:58:59,770
them away. How have they not
made a movie about this guy?

904
00:59:01,570 --> 00:59:05,380
He preferred to you as iron sights rather
than telescopic sites for all you gun

905
00:59:05,381 --> 00:59:07,420
nuts to present a smaller target.

906
00:59:10,570 --> 00:59:11,320
Uh Oh,
I see.

907
00:59:11,320 --> 00:59:15,190
Cause the sniper must raise his head
higher when using a telescopic sight to

908
00:59:15,191 --> 00:59:19,960
prevent visibility risks. A telescopic
sights glass can fog up easily.

909
00:59:21,130 --> 00:59:22,520
Okay.

910
00:59:23,030 --> 00:59:25,550
[inaudible] the Soviets tried a
number of ways to get rid of him.

911
00:59:26,000 --> 00:59:29,400
Counter sniper's artillery
strikes and filing. On May six,

912
00:59:29,401 --> 00:59:33,740
the guy was shot through the jaw during
combat by a Russian soldier. The,

913
00:59:34,030 --> 00:59:37,400
the bullet tumbled upon
impact and left his head.

914
00:59:38,840 --> 00:59:41,450
Fellow soldier picked him up.
Half his head was missing.

915
00:59:41,451 --> 00:59:44,600
He regained consciousness
seven days later,

916
00:59:45,380 --> 00:59:50,090
the day peace was declared. Shortly
after the war, uh, this dude was,

917
00:59:50,091 --> 00:59:52,310
went straight from corporal
to a second lieutenant,

918
00:59:52,311 --> 00:59:57,200
the highest jump and rank in the
history of the Finnish army. Uh, wow.

919
00:59:57,650 --> 01:00:01,160
Did that board, I'll be like, I didn't
bore you guys too much, but uh, they,

920
01:00:01,170 --> 01:00:04,460
you go and they asked him later on
in life, did, did it bother you?

921
01:00:04,520 --> 01:00:07,670
The amount of people that you kill,
which is such a Douchey fucking question.

922
01:00:08,090 --> 01:00:10,970
And he just basically said, look, I
was doing the job they told me to do.

923
01:00:11,810 --> 01:00:15,530
Like they all end up fucking same.
Did it bother you?

924
01:00:16,460 --> 01:00:20,000
Did it bother me that I killed the guys
who were trying to kill me? Uh, no,

925
01:00:20,001 --> 01:00:20,834
it didn't.

926
01:00:24,200 --> 01:00:28,190
I'm sure a couple of dumb fucks who
thought they were in the clear and got up

927
01:00:28,191 --> 01:00:30,260
and took a Piss,
you know,

928
01:00:30,380 --> 01:00:33,980
and he kind of felt bad like Jesus
Christ do Kaylee's pissed behind a tree,

929
01:00:35,060 --> 01:00:38,570
you know, maybe that wouldn't make
you feel bad. What are you guys think?

930
01:00:38,571 --> 01:00:41,570
Do you think you'd feel bad?
Um,

931
01:00:44,210 --> 01:00:47,930
I would just think if I went to war,
I've always felt this,

932
01:00:47,931 --> 01:00:51,350
that the second the battle started,
I would be,

933
01:00:51,530 --> 01:00:53,240
I would be the guy crying in the Fox hole,

934
01:00:53,241 --> 01:00:57,590
but if I could ever just kill that first
fucking person, I would just be like,

935
01:00:57,591 --> 01:01:01,430
all right, well, you know,
fuck it now. And, uh,

936
01:01:01,460 --> 01:01:06,380
I just think I would be so
filled with anger and fear that,

937
01:01:07,010 --> 01:01:11,840
uh, I dunno. I Dunno. That's,

938
01:01:12,050 --> 01:01:16,070
and I have no fucking, you know,
those people who fight in wars, man,

939
01:01:16,071 --> 01:01:20,920
people would join the service.
Jesus Christ. I don't know.
I, I don't think I could.

940
01:01:20,990 --> 01:01:23,570
And you know, as much as people sit
there and they talk about, you know,

941
01:01:23,870 --> 01:01:27,890
the balls it takes to do stand up,
you know,

942
01:01:29,410 --> 01:01:32,330
it, it really pales in fucking
comparison when, you know,

943
01:01:32,930 --> 01:01:36,260
if you just talk about someone who goes
into the Peace Corps is trying to bring

944
01:01:36,261 --> 01:01:40,100
water to a try, forget about
somebody who's fucking going
to war. And speaking of,

945
01:01:40,101 --> 01:01:43,940
let's talk about standup terminology.
Here's something that, um,

946
01:01:45,140 --> 01:01:49,830
has been bugging me lately
is I've noticed that, um,

947
01:01:49,990 --> 01:01:54,800
and this happens, you know, people
come up with new words like a,

948
01:01:54,801 --> 01:01:56,180
you know,
I'm chilling,

949
01:01:56,810 --> 01:01:59,720
I'm going to use like hip hop slang
because that's always the easiest.

950
01:01:59,780 --> 01:02:00,890
You know what,
I get this old ones,

951
01:02:00,891 --> 01:02:04,430
I can really think of it then they just
become words. But, uh, just as, as a,

952
01:02:04,431 --> 01:02:09,320
as a stand up comic purest I've noticed,

953
01:02:09,321 --> 01:02:10,820
you know,
when I get into it with the crab,

954
01:02:10,821 --> 01:02:14,150
when somebody heckles me and then
I give him shit back, I get emails.

955
01:02:14,150 --> 01:02:16,520
I was at your second show,
sat on Saturday night.

956
01:02:17,030 --> 01:02:21,390
I loved the way you heckled guy in
the audience after he heckled you.

957
01:02:22,650 --> 01:02:25,020
Um,
heckling is done by the crowd.

958
01:02:25,710 --> 01:02:27,660
The comedian does not heckle the crowd.

959
01:02:27,661 --> 01:02:31,190
He can play with the
crowd and he can fucking,

960
01:02:31,200 --> 01:02:35,790
I don't even know what it's called. When
you, when you fucking murderer a heckler,

961
01:02:35,791 --> 01:02:39,030
you destroy them, but you're
not heckling them. All right?

962
01:02:39,031 --> 01:02:43,320
You're up there trying to do your rec.
The only way for a comedian to,

963
01:02:43,380 --> 01:02:45,180
to heckle a crowd as if he,

964
01:02:45,181 --> 01:02:49,650
if he sat in the crowd and the hope and
the whole crowd got up on stage and then

965
01:02:49,651 --> 01:02:54,651
tried to do some to some
sort of performance and I
interrupted and fucked up

966
01:02:55,861 --> 01:02:59,910
their performance. But when they
tell me to go fuck themselves,

967
01:03:00,060 --> 01:03:04,810
fuck myself, they're
not heckling me. Jesus.

968
01:03:04,950 --> 01:03:07,350
You would think that I would actually
have the decency to look up heckle.

969
01:03:10,070 --> 01:03:13,380
Why don't I do that?
Heckle definition?

970
01:03:13,740 --> 01:03:17,070
Goddamn at that beer tasted
good and I get a fucking 6:54 AM

971
01:03:18,690 --> 01:03:20,220
definition for heckle.

972
01:03:23,780 --> 01:03:24,870
Uh, okay. Here we go.

973
01:03:27,030 --> 01:03:30,810
Try to embarrass and annoyed by questions.

974
01:03:31,380 --> 01:03:32,310
Jibes or objections.

975
01:03:32,311 --> 01:03:36,660
Badger try to annoy someone speaking
or performing in public by questions.

976
01:03:37,200 --> 01:03:39,570
Jibes or objections and
bad. There you go. See,

977
01:03:39,571 --> 01:03:43,710
that's why you can't because you're not
trying to perform in public. All right,

978
01:03:43,770 --> 01:03:46,950
I skipped over the shit in parentheses.
So let me read that again. Try to,

979
01:03:47,880 --> 01:03:52,650
Heckerling is trying to embarrass and
annoy someone speaking or performing in

980
01:03:52,651 --> 01:03:56,790
public by questions. Jibes or
objections, badger or whatever.

981
01:03:57,360 --> 01:03:58,230
That's what it means.

982
01:03:58,231 --> 01:04:03,231
So the comedian can't heckle the crowd
because the crowd is not on stage trying

983
01:04:04,261 --> 01:04:07,800
to give a performance.
So for the love of God,

984
01:04:08,130 --> 01:04:11,820
stop sending me fucking emails saying
you loved how I heckled the crowd.

985
01:04:12,120 --> 01:04:16,350
I didn't do that. It's like telling
a guitarist, I love your drum solo.

986
01:04:18,030 --> 01:04:20,700
Did they make any sense as this
alcohol taking place? I haven't drank.

987
01:04:20,760 --> 01:04:22,080
I haven't fucking eight in a minute.

988
01:04:22,860 --> 01:04:27,330
You know this beer is fucking delicious.
You know what makes a beer like this?

989
01:04:27,331 --> 01:04:30,210
Tastes go to good beer glass.
Do you guys have beer glasses?

990
01:04:30,420 --> 01:04:34,590
Talking to the men out there and the few
women out there who are a fuck you guys.

991
01:04:34,830 --> 01:04:39,000
Women aren't into beer glasses,
are you? You know what I mean?

992
01:04:39,001 --> 01:04:42,360
Lesbians on my podcast, maybe you guys
have the brains to like beer glasses.

993
01:04:44,160 --> 01:04:46,470
Um, Jesus Christ. You know, I
usually don't make any sense,

994
01:04:46,471 --> 01:04:50,430
but me buzz doing this podcast is
going to make even less and less sense.

995
01:04:51,300 --> 01:04:55,260
That's a fucking sign of maturity. A
beer glass. And that's another thing.

996
01:04:55,261 --> 01:04:59,280
If you want to stave off the fact
that you kind of think that you have a

997
01:04:59,281 --> 01:05:02,460
drinking problem is if in your house,

998
01:05:02,461 --> 01:05:07,461
if you have the proper glasses for
whatever alcohol you're drinking,

999
01:05:07,800 --> 01:05:10,500
okay, you're drinking whiskey
out of a disc Dixie Cup.

1000
01:05:10,920 --> 01:05:13,050
Let me stutter in like a shit head.
That was a good line too.

1001
01:05:13,260 --> 01:05:17,980
If you're drinking whiskey out
of a Dixie Cup, take to uh, yeah,

1002
01:05:18,010 --> 01:05:22,600
there's really no way,
you know,

1003
01:05:23,720 --> 01:05:25,660
a little vodka in a sippy cup.

1004
01:05:26,410 --> 01:05:28,840
She kids crying in the corner
because he's fucking hungry.

1005
01:05:31,810 --> 01:05:34,960
Uh, hang on one second. Hang on a second.
What are we going? What do I got here?

1006
01:05:35,650 --> 01:05:40,630
Hey Paul, let me call you back. I'm doing
my podcast. All right. All right man.

1007
01:05:40,631 --> 01:05:44,830
Take it easy. Um, all
right. Where the fuck am I?

1008
01:05:45,940 --> 01:05:48,850
Yeah. You know what I mean? But if you
have the right, you have the proper glass.

1009
01:05:49,960 --> 01:05:52,900
I have the classic 16 ounce,
you know,

1010
01:05:53,050 --> 01:05:54,670
you'd pour a Heineken
in this type of thing.

1011
01:05:54,820 --> 01:05:56,770
I actually got those
Sam Adams glasses too.

1012
01:05:56,771 --> 01:05:59,740
You know the ones that they had where
they got some sort of special glass thing

1013
01:05:59,741 --> 01:06:03,940
at the bottom and it makes the beers,
you know, the Sam Adams Swirl up,

1014
01:06:04,330 --> 01:06:07,720
they're really cool glasses. But what I
don't like as they only hold 12 ounces,

1015
01:06:08,710 --> 01:06:11,440
you know, and it's just
like, well, what about me?

1016
01:06:11,470 --> 01:06:14,650
Who likes to go 16 ounces at a time?
You know?

1017
01:06:17,610 --> 01:06:19,210
All right.
I'm not even being funny right now.

1018
01:06:19,211 --> 01:06:23,590
I'm just fucking sitting here enjoying a,
there's nothing better.

1019
01:06:23,591 --> 01:06:26,260
One Nice fucking beer.
But can you ever stop?

1020
01:06:28,450 --> 01:06:30,070
You know what's funny is my
girl's not here right now.

1021
01:06:30,071 --> 01:06:33,130
He'd be funny if I'm just sitting here
in my fucking boxers and just, just,

1022
01:06:33,160 --> 01:06:37,000
she comes home and I'm about ready to
go on the road for another five days and

1023
01:06:37,001 --> 01:06:41,260
then she just comes home and I'm just
fucking sitting here buzzed, you know,

1024
01:06:42,100 --> 01:06:45,940
t shirt, boxers, socks. I mean,

1025
01:06:45,941 --> 01:06:48,700
I'm just dressed like I'm unemployed.

1026
01:06:51,430 --> 01:06:55,540
Then all I gotta do is just start giving
a shit. Why am I such a Dick? All right,

1027
01:06:55,570 --> 01:06:58,480
let's continue on here. Um, yeah,

1028
01:06:58,481 --> 01:07:00,610
that would be on sightful
in our speaking of shit.

1029
01:07:00,611 --> 01:07:03,910
That's just fucking on sightful to use a,
a,

1030
01:07:04,660 --> 01:07:06,730
a segue from the 1980s,

1031
01:07:07,740 --> 01:07:12,010
I was flying back from New York and uh,
you know,

1032
01:07:12,130 --> 01:07:14,080
it's a real pet bait.
Pet peeve of mine is these,

1033
01:07:14,110 --> 01:07:18,810
these motherfucking like regular
look and people who just get here,

1034
01:07:18,940 --> 01:07:21,700
they kicked his shoes off
during the flight. All right?

1035
01:07:21,701 --> 01:07:26,200
And then not wearing any socks.
All right?

1036
01:07:26,201 --> 01:07:31,201
So it's gross enough that you have your
bare feet on that airline carpet were

1037
01:07:33,251 --> 01:07:37,720
God knows what is in the rug.
Okay.

1038
01:07:38,620 --> 01:07:41,500
You know how filthy the fucking
errors in the Goddamn tube,

1039
01:07:41,501 --> 01:07:44,410
they never recycled that fucking
air. You're just breathing. I mean,

1040
01:07:44,411 --> 01:07:47,770
it's like 80% carbon dioxide,
right?

1041
01:07:49,300 --> 01:07:51,400
So what the fuck you think is in the rug?

1042
01:07:52,300 --> 01:07:55,780
If you ever seen him shampoo a goddamn
rug in between flights, they don't do it.

1043
01:07:56,020 --> 01:07:59,440
And you put your bare feet on this. What
kills me? This is regular fucking people.

1044
01:08:00,100 --> 01:08:02,470
After, after they've kicked his shoes
off, they have to go to the bathroom.

1045
01:08:02,471 --> 01:08:03,304
They get up and they,

1046
01:08:03,420 --> 01:08:08,420
they walked down the aisle
into the bathroom with no
fucking socks or shoes on.

1047
01:08:10,730 --> 01:08:14,160
So most disgusting. I saw
this girl sitting next to
me. She had one of those, uh,

1048
01:08:14,190 --> 01:08:16,370
English Australian can't
pick out the accent,

1049
01:08:17,720 --> 01:08:18,553
you know,

1050
01:08:19,180 --> 01:08:22,630
the next time you fucking European
shit on what animals, we are over here.

1051
01:08:22,631 --> 01:08:26,500
One of your fucking, when you fucking
birds who is sitting next to me,

1052
01:08:26,501 --> 01:08:30,190
got up with their flip flops
on now, kicked him off. And
then while she actually,

1053
01:08:30,191 --> 01:08:33,310
I'll give her credit. She did walk halfway
to the bathroom and then came back,

1054
01:08:34,230 --> 01:08:36,950
you know, and I was like, all
right, she has some class,

1055
01:08:37,070 --> 01:08:40,070
but she had her hair up and
she had flakes behind her ear.

1056
01:08:41,050 --> 01:08:42,680
Just disgusting the whole fucking flight,

1057
01:08:42,681 --> 01:08:46,220
and I could stop looking at it every time
I'd glance over and then I would just

1058
01:08:46,221 --> 01:08:48,260
keep making these noises going.
Ah.

1059
01:08:48,980 --> 01:08:51,680
Then she sort of glance at me and I
pretend like I didn't do what she probably

1060
01:08:51,681 --> 01:08:55,280
thought I had Tourette's and she didn't
realize that I'm reacting to the fucking

1061
01:08:55,450 --> 01:08:59,510
the fucking flakes behind you. You're
kind of a mother. Are you going to be,

1062
01:08:59,570 --> 01:09:01,610
you can't even clean behind
your own fucking years.

1063
01:09:02,630 --> 01:09:05,540
Put your head down and go walk
barefoot to the fucking airplane,

1064
01:09:06,220 --> 01:09:09,710
goddamn bathroom and clean yourself
up before I slap the shit out of you.

1065
01:09:10,430 --> 01:09:13,320
All right, what else do
we got here? All right.

1066
01:09:13,321 --> 01:09:16,620
Here's a good youtube video for the
week as the fucking booze is starting to

1067
01:09:16,621 --> 01:09:19,770
kick in a Boddingtons,
I highly recommend it.

1068
01:09:20,300 --> 01:09:24,800
All right? You youngsters out there,
you're probably not gonna like it. Um,

1069
01:09:25,380 --> 01:09:26,100
all right.

1070
01:09:26,100 --> 01:09:30,600
But as your voice gets deeper and your
ball stuck to drop even further into the

1071
01:09:30,601 --> 01:09:33,000
toilet bowl, I'm telling you it's a
bear. You're going to fucking like,

1072
01:09:33,030 --> 01:09:38,000
what am I doing here? What the
hell am I? All right. Note to self,

1073
01:09:38,001 --> 01:09:41,070
don't drink when you do the
podcast anymore. What did
you guys enjoy? Podcasts?

1074
01:09:41,210 --> 01:09:44,960
So I just got completely shit faced.
The thing is, is it's only an hour long,

1075
01:09:44,961 --> 01:09:48,470
so it's kind of hard to get drunk that
quick. I can get pretty buzzed, you know,

1076
01:09:48,560 --> 01:09:51,650
really bill, is that what we're here?
We're down to right now was like,

1077
01:09:51,651 --> 01:09:55,070
you're going to do like some fucking
stunt like David Blaine. Bill,

1078
01:09:55,071 --> 01:09:58,100
why don't you do the podcast and a
fucking block of ice? You'd dumb cunt.

1079
01:09:58,400 --> 01:10:00,350
I think it's time for a
special guest at some point.

1080
01:10:00,351 --> 01:10:04,070
I gotta I gotta get another special
guest on this podcast. Um, all right,

1081
01:10:04,071 --> 01:10:09,000
plowing ahead here. Um, here's a
youtube video to watch for this week.

1082
01:10:09,330 --> 01:10:12,610
Ah,
baby preacher with subtitles.

1083
01:10:14,380 --> 01:10:15,380
Uh,
it's just fucking awesome.

1084
01:10:16,650 --> 01:10:20,190
It's a a, I dunno, this
baby who that guest is,

1085
01:10:20,191 --> 01:10:24,600
goes to church every fucking day and
his watch these preachers preaching and

1086
01:10:24,601 --> 01:10:27,970
then they gave the baby the Mike and it's
just sort of walking around going, Eh,

1087
01:10:28,490 --> 01:10:29,670
eh,
talking baby talk.

1088
01:10:29,671 --> 01:10:34,671
But somebody transcribes what the kid
is saying and I swear to God it the way

1089
01:10:35,101 --> 01:10:36,310
they put it up there it

1090
01:10:37,200 --> 01:10:40,920
right as you read it. The baby says
it and it sounds like the baby saying,

1091
01:10:40,921 --> 01:10:44,640
and it's fucking, and it's a visual
joke and I'm trying to explain it here.

1092
01:10:44,930 --> 01:10:47,160
All right. Underrated.
Overrated for this week.

1093
01:10:47,190 --> 01:10:51,510
I'm doing this at a half hour in knowing
full well that I have to somehow fill

1094
01:10:51,511 --> 01:10:53,550
up another 20 fucking minutes.
All right.

1095
01:10:55,090 --> 01:10:58,600
Overrated for this week.
This is a great one.

1096
01:10:58,930 --> 01:11:02,440
Overrated wind chimes is,
Dude says,

1097
01:11:02,441 --> 01:11:06,760
I hate the annoying clink clank
sound with a fucking passion.

1098
01:11:07,510 --> 01:11:11,110
What is wrong with the people? Huh?
What's wrong with people? Seriously,

1099
01:11:11,260 --> 01:11:15,390
the world is not loud.
You have to fucking add to it.

1100
01:11:17,630 --> 01:11:18,740
You know they,

1101
01:11:18,830 --> 01:11:23,810
they do believe the sounds will make
them better people or make life better.

1102
01:11:24,260 --> 01:11:26,160
You know what dude?
You want such a great roll to your right.

1103
01:11:26,420 --> 01:11:28,570
Wrote that fucking sentence. Yeah. Oh,

1104
01:11:28,571 --> 01:11:32,920
what do they believe the sounds will make
them better people or make their life

1105
01:11:32,921 --> 01:11:36,800
better? I found it most
annoying and of in invasive,

1106
01:11:37,930 --> 01:11:42,780
right? I find it. Oh Jesus Christ, I'm
never drinking on the podcast again.

1107
01:11:43,260 --> 01:11:46,590
Go fuck yourselves. All right. What
is wrong with people? Where am I?

1108
01:11:46,830 --> 01:11:51,030
I find it the most annoying and evasive
thing. I am forced to listen to,

1109
01:11:51,210 --> 01:11:55,320
even with closed windows,
but they're so peaceful.

1110
01:11:56,700 --> 01:11:58,110
Um,
if you fucking like the sound,

1111
01:11:58,230 --> 01:12:01,680
why don't you put them up inside your
home and have the fucking fan going

1112
01:12:03,440 --> 01:12:06,990
in any way? What gives anybody the right
to push their taste on others? Dude,

1113
01:12:06,991 --> 01:12:10,830
I totally agree. It's like if you're
going to make smokers smoke outside,

1114
01:12:11,010 --> 01:12:14,310
then you want to make these fucking wind
chime. People take that shit indoors.

1115
01:12:14,460 --> 01:12:16,850
I can't tell you how annoying that is.
It's uh,

1116
01:12:16,890 --> 01:12:21,450
you know what's annoying about it is it's
an annoying sound that's trying to be

1117
01:12:21,451 --> 01:12:25,630
fucking spiritual. That's what
kills me. It's even, um, it's,

1118
01:12:25,640 --> 01:12:28,980
it's more annoying than just the loud,
annoying sound that's fucking annoying.

1119
01:12:29,130 --> 01:12:32,430
Cause at least the loud annoying sound
has to fucking courage to be annoying.

1120
01:12:33,980 --> 01:12:36,610
Those fucking things. They
actually, they're there,
they're there. You know what,

1121
01:12:36,611 --> 01:12:40,100
when I go on youtube and just get some
fucking wind chime sounds for all you've

1122
01:12:40,490 --> 01:12:42,470
done concert out there who do yoga,

1123
01:12:43,320 --> 01:12:47,190
you know and actually think that these
fucking things sound good. Here we go.

1124
01:12:47,191 --> 01:12:52,140
Wind fucking Shaimes youtube.
Let's see what we got. Here we go.

1125
01:12:52,141 --> 01:12:54,720
Yeah, cause somebody fucking loves
him so much. They put up a video.

1126
01:12:54,721 --> 01:12:58,630
Here we go for all you cops
out there. Here it is. Okay.

1127
01:13:07,480 --> 01:13:08,313
[inaudible]

1128
01:13:08,500 --> 01:13:09,670
I got to.
Those are nice.

1129
01:13:12,390 --> 01:13:12,890
[inaudible]

1130
01:13:12,890 --> 01:13:16,610
this isn't fair. This guy's got fuck. He's
got the professional grade level ones.

1131
01:13:16,611 --> 01:13:21,160
He thinks look like the
exhaust on a Goddamn. Okay.
Oh, that's giant wind change.

1132
01:13:21,180 --> 01:13:26,100
All right. I just learned
something. I don't mind. Giant
wind chimes. Oh, here's one.

1133
01:13:26,101 --> 01:13:28,890
Here's one of these little douchey ones
you get at a fucking hardware store.

1134
01:13:29,390 --> 01:13:33,880
Yeah, just typical youtube. You
just can't put wind chimes, Elliot.

1135
01:13:34,020 --> 01:13:36,830
Beautiful wind shame.
Is this the county and one

1136
01:13:40,790 --> 01:13:41,623
there it is.

1137
01:13:46,740 --> 01:13:47,210
[inaudible].

1138
01:13:47,210 --> 01:13:49,310
You know what the great thing is,
is they're made out of metal.

1139
01:13:49,311 --> 01:13:50,360
So when you rip them off,

1140
01:13:50,361 --> 01:13:54,020
you have a fucking blunt object to beat
your neighbor to death with [inaudible].

1141
01:13:54,350 --> 01:13:55,071
That's what you do.

1142
01:13:55,071 --> 01:13:58,850
And then you dip it in and fucking
peroxide or bleach and you hook it back up

1143
01:13:58,851 --> 01:14:00,630
again.
Let those a and e cons.

1144
01:14:01,040 --> 01:14:05,000
Figure out that murder a
man murdered on his porch.

1145
01:14:06,540 --> 01:14:09,620
You know, somehow they'd
find, you know, and a fucking,

1146
01:14:11,740 --> 01:14:12,191
I don't know,

1147
01:14:12,191 --> 01:14:15,730
an eighth of an inch of his face
imprint on that fucking wind chime.

1148
01:14:15,880 --> 01:14:18,790
If you ever watched those a and e things,
how they catch people, it's, it's like,

1149
01:14:18,791 --> 01:14:20,440
it's not even fucking fair.

1150
01:14:23,490 --> 01:14:27,170
You ever see the one as I take another
healthy way. I got news for you.

1151
01:14:27,171 --> 01:14:29,390
I'm having another beer.
This might be the new thing.

1152
01:14:29,391 --> 01:14:33,110
I might do this shit Thursday night.
Take a night off from stand up.

1153
01:14:33,710 --> 01:14:36,050
Tell my chick to hit the fucking bricks.

1154
01:14:36,800 --> 01:14:39,200
Is there anything better than
drinking your own goddamn house?

1155
01:14:39,201 --> 01:14:43,430
It just makes you want to start screaming
about this shit you own. You know

1156
01:14:46,430 --> 01:14:50,840
I paid for this shit.
You hear that old man downstairs,

1157
01:14:50,841 --> 01:14:52,310
I'm going to get louder and
he's going to come up here.

1158
01:14:52,311 --> 01:14:56,360
That would be the ultimate podcast. You
know what the thing about old people is,

1159
01:14:56,361 --> 01:15:00,130
you always have to worry that they
are a fucking, like they, they,

1160
01:15:00,131 --> 01:15:03,610
they fought in a fucking war
cause I never had, I never have.

1161
01:15:03,611 --> 01:15:07,540
So I have total respect
for fucking veterans in the
fact that they still got it

1162
01:15:07,541 --> 01:15:08,950
in him.
You know,

1163
01:15:09,480 --> 01:15:12,020
that would be insane one night if I
actually just totally pissed him off.

1164
01:15:12,021 --> 01:15:15,920
And he really did fight in the Korean
War and he just fucking through whatever

1165
01:15:15,921 --> 01:15:17,860
that fucking thing is
you throw up when you,

1166
01:15:17,900 --> 01:15:21,260
when you're gonna climb up the rope on
the side of the building, you know, that,

1167
01:15:21,261 --> 01:15:21,610
that,

1168
01:15:21,610 --> 01:15:26,600
that fucking land fish hook thing
throws it up there and just climbs up.

1169
01:15:26,630 --> 01:15:31,610
Comes over my railing as I'm sitting
here doing this podcast. Half in the bag.

1170
01:15:32,760 --> 01:15:35,960
Yeah. He's got a kitchen knife between
his teeth, like a fucking pirate.

1171
01:15:37,510 --> 01:15:38,343
What would I do?

1172
01:15:39,650 --> 01:15:44,650
I've probably taken 12 karate classes
in my life and they've all been like,

1173
01:15:46,250 --> 01:15:49,800
you know, six years apart. Yeah.

1174
01:15:50,280 --> 01:15:53,910
Fucking guy coming in
and fully me. Yeah, know

1175
01:15:55,760 --> 01:15:58,880
I don't fucking know. I just sat back
and I just lost the screen here. Yeah.

1176
01:15:58,890 --> 01:16:02,270
So whatever wind chimes are
fucking overrated. They really are.

1177
01:16:02,271 --> 01:16:04,490
But I gotta tell you, if you get
the giant ones, the giant ones,

1178
01:16:04,491 --> 01:16:07,830
a nice listen to the giant ones that
Jason wants to have a nice tone to him.

1179
01:16:08,100 --> 01:16:10,590
It's a little deeper.
I think I figured it out.

1180
01:16:18,900 --> 01:16:20,340
Come on man.
You gotta admit that's not bad.

1181
01:16:20,640 --> 01:16:23,940
If you let go of the anger you childhood,
right? Let go of anger for a second.

1182
01:16:30,300 --> 01:16:33,390
Si sound of a ship in the background.

1183
01:16:37,510 --> 01:16:38,343
Uh,

1184
01:16:38,700 --> 01:16:39,533
okay.

1185
01:16:44,010 --> 01:16:45,980
The ocean coming up on the beach.

1186
01:16:52,880 --> 01:16:56,270
You have get to that point right when
you're going to get relaxed and let go and

1187
01:16:56,271 --> 01:16:57,650
then you get so fucking scared.

1188
01:16:57,651 --> 01:17:01,100
You get right back into the anger and
then you want to punch somebody in fucking

1189
01:17:01,101 --> 01:17:05,940
yoga pants. Um, all right, I have
enough with the fucking windshield here.

1190
01:17:06,590 --> 01:17:09,320
That was really painting a picture there.
I fucking Michael Winslow here.

1191
01:17:09,620 --> 01:17:12,140
I think it's time for more booze.
What do you guys think?

1192
01:17:12,620 --> 01:17:15,930
How about a nice healthy sip.
Yeah.

1193
01:17:18,700 --> 01:17:23,290
Ah, God dammit. It's fucking delicious.
He poor bastards and Owen. Oh,

1194
01:17:23,340 --> 01:17:25,410
and a you poor bastards in Aa.

1195
01:17:26,800 --> 01:17:29,320
And that was one good thing about
the trip. Uh, when I went back,

1196
01:17:30,290 --> 01:17:34,670
it's actually got to do open Anthony and
I'm going to do it again. Um, next week,

1197
01:17:34,671 --> 01:17:36,290
probably again the Tuesday again,

1198
01:17:36,291 --> 01:17:40,760
I'm on the exact same flight
back to Los Angeles. I did it,

1199
01:17:40,761 --> 01:17:45,050
the opiod Anthony show this past Tuesday,
popped in there for like an hour.

1200
01:17:45,051 --> 01:17:49,160
I had a good fucking time.
Didn't get a chance to argue with Anthony,

1201
01:17:49,161 --> 01:17:54,090
but you know, it's still good
to say them as adorable as ever.

1202
01:17:54,730 --> 01:17:57,930
All right, let's uh,
let's plow ahead here. Um,

1203
01:17:58,440 --> 01:18:01,890
let's get to some more fucking
overrated shit. Um, overrated.

1204
01:18:02,790 --> 01:18:04,850
Super expensive TVS.

1205
01:18:05,620 --> 01:18:09,280
Who the fuck needs to
spend two grand on a TV?

1206
01:18:10,120 --> 01:18:13,870
I know the super clear, et Cetera,
but it's not like it's, it's,

1207
01:18:14,230 --> 01:18:18,950
I'm a huge jump. My eight year
old, Sony still works great.

1208
01:18:19,100 --> 01:18:22,010
The picture is fine.
If I want to watch some great TV,

1209
01:18:22,190 --> 01:18:26,990
I'll just go to one of a hundred bars
in the city that have 80 of them slapped

1210
01:18:26,991 --> 01:18:29,190
on the walls.
Which another thing,

1211
01:18:29,280 --> 01:18:34,020
which is another thing that's overrated
cookie cutter bars with a million TVs

1212
01:18:34,170 --> 01:18:37,080
and zero atmosphere.
But I digress

1213
01:18:39,410 --> 01:18:39,960
you guys,

1214
01:18:39,960 --> 01:18:43,290
while you guys are fucking good writers
and I like how you said I digress rather

1215
01:18:43,291 --> 01:18:44,580
than me last week when I say,

1216
01:18:44,581 --> 01:18:49,581
but I digressed in the past tense because
I never use that expression animal

1217
01:18:50,011 --> 01:18:50,844
memorial on.

1218
01:18:51,400 --> 01:18:53,610
Um, dude, I have to totally
agree with you. In fact,

1219
01:18:53,611 --> 01:18:56,760
I would still have an
old school TV if I'm,

1220
01:18:57,590 --> 01:18:59,810
I didn't move from New York,
New York to La.

1221
01:19:00,020 --> 01:19:01,370
I was going to keep my old school one.

1222
01:19:01,400 --> 01:19:06,400
I had no problem watching the
game on the old school square TV.

1223
01:19:07,480 --> 01:19:12,440
It didn't bug me. You know, I don't
need to see that. The inside of shacks,

1224
01:19:12,920 --> 01:19:16,790
I don't need to see shacks. Fucking,
you know, knows Cartlidge. Ever.

1225
01:19:16,791 --> 01:19:19,000
When I first got HDTV,
I was watching a,

1226
01:19:19,001 --> 01:19:22,970
I was watching ESPN and like Stuart Scott
or one of those guys is doing it and

1227
01:19:22,971 --> 01:19:25,940
I'm like looking at his pores and I
could see actually a little bit of the

1228
01:19:25,941 --> 01:19:29,750
inside of his nose. Nose wasn't dirty or
nothing, but it was just, it's like, dude,

1229
01:19:30,310 --> 01:19:32,180
all I need is just to hear the scores.

1230
01:19:34,610 --> 01:19:38,630
I'll tell you know it's fucking overrated
too and I hope it flops like fucking

1231
01:19:38,631 --> 01:19:41,000
David Beckham in La are.

1232
01:19:41,001 --> 01:19:44,930
Here's one great overrated
is fucking Shit in three d.

1233
01:19:46,590 --> 01:19:50,430
All right,
Avatar in three day.

1234
01:19:50,431 --> 01:19:51,780
Who gives a fuck?

1235
01:19:52,680 --> 01:19:56,820
Some butterfly flying near
you face your goddamn ferry.

1236
01:19:57,330 --> 01:19:58,680
The fuck is wrong with you

1237
01:19:59,310 --> 01:20:02,590
and all these idiots who are going
to go out and buy three d TVs.

1238
01:20:02,980 --> 01:20:07,220
You dumb fucks if you buy a three D TV.

1239
01:20:07,320 --> 01:20:08,220
You know what she'll like?

1240
01:20:08,370 --> 01:20:09,070
You like those?

1241
01:20:09,070 --> 01:20:12,960
Do you like one of those dumb shits
who keeps buying the new razor blades?

1242
01:20:14,220 --> 01:20:17,640
Has any razor blade worked
better than the fucking,

1243
01:20:17,641 --> 01:20:22,641
all you needed was to one sucked too
was the shit three doesn't do underneath

1244
01:20:23,191 --> 01:20:24,960
your nose.
You've got to pinch your nose,

1245
01:20:24,961 --> 01:20:27,660
like you're in a barbershop
in the 19 fucking twenties,

1246
01:20:27,840 --> 01:20:31,080
getting a straight razor shave
during a fucking three stooges film.

1247
01:20:31,920 --> 01:20:33,690
And then it goes all the way up to four.

1248
01:20:34,110 --> 01:20:37,470
And then they knew they couldn't do
five or did they do five and now they're

1249
01:20:37,471 --> 01:20:42,060
trying to act like the blades or even
fucking sharper. It's all bullshit.

1250
01:20:42,720 --> 01:20:43,920
The worst thing that ever happened to me,

1251
01:20:43,921 --> 01:20:46,170
one time I was doing college of something,

1252
01:20:46,590 --> 01:20:50,280
I think I was in Florida and
it was the double whammy.

1253
01:20:51,450 --> 01:20:52,800
I had a toiletry,

1254
01:20:53,130 --> 01:20:56,940
a bag from tough crowd,

1255
01:20:57,750 --> 01:21:02,110
one of my favorite fucking shows to
do. Tough crowd with Colin Quinn. Um,

1256
01:21:02,130 --> 01:21:05,470
and one of the, one of the gift
bags they gave you was, was this,

1257
01:21:05,690 --> 01:21:10,530
this toiletry bag. It's a tough crowd
on it and shit, you know. And uh,

1258
01:21:10,590 --> 01:21:15,540
not only did I leave that for God
and in the bathroom, but my, uh,

1259
01:21:16,380 --> 01:21:17,160
my razor,

1260
01:21:17,160 --> 01:21:22,020
my twin bladed razor was in it
and they don't sell them anymore.

1261
01:21:22,021 --> 01:21:25,920
And ever since then I've had the
triple one and it just sucks. Hey,

1262
01:21:26,010 --> 01:21:27,450
if there's one whisker right in that,

1263
01:21:27,451 --> 01:21:30,900
that the skin between your
fucking nostrils, I can't get it.

1264
01:21:31,250 --> 01:21:33,840
I can't get it and I got to do all
these different fucking tricks.

1265
01:21:34,110 --> 01:21:35,940
I'll do it right now. You
just, I gotta like, you know,

1266
01:21:37,170 --> 01:21:41,280
make my nose look like that fucking
chicks knows in the Batman revenge movie.

1267
01:21:43,410 --> 01:21:47,110
Um, I bet she has no
problem. I was kind of mean.

1268
01:21:49,830 --> 01:21:54,540
Yeah. So you guys do me a
favor. All right. Don't buy
it. Don't buy three D TV's.

1269
01:21:54,541 --> 01:21:59,490
Don't fucking buy him. Okay. Two
dimensional football is still the shit.

1270
01:21:59,760 --> 01:22:04,110
Are you really going to sit there on
the couch with your friend wearing those

1271
01:22:04,111 --> 01:22:07,210
stupid fucking glasses?
So what?

1272
01:22:07,690 --> 01:22:10,950
[inaudible] balls can be in your face.
Come on.

1273
01:22:11,970 --> 01:22:14,430
You want to see it in three d?
Go to the fucking game.

1274
01:22:16,230 --> 01:22:17,760
I'll watch the TVS will be awesome.

1275
01:22:19,080 --> 01:22:21,090
The TVS will be awesome and
eventually I'll get them.

1276
01:22:21,091 --> 01:22:25,080
If you guys noticed what a fucking
hypocrite I am, I bought the Prius,

1277
01:22:25,081 --> 01:22:27,930
I defended it.
And slowly I'm going towards a challenger.

1278
01:22:28,950 --> 01:22:32,070
You know how fucking totally
into into conspiracy theory.

1279
01:22:32,071 --> 01:22:34,200
I'm actually still into that shit.
And I don't give a fuck.

1280
01:22:34,201 --> 01:22:36,960
Now I'm just sitting here in my
underwear doing a podcast and on Thursday

1281
01:22:36,961 --> 01:22:39,030
drinking a beer,
you know,

1282
01:22:40,020 --> 01:22:44,850
I quit fucking quit. You know what
I realized the other day too is a,

1283
01:22:45,420 --> 01:22:47,340
you don't have a gate.
You start talking shit.

1284
01:22:47,370 --> 01:22:51,690
When you get into conspiracy theory,
you actually think that like, you know,

1285
01:22:51,750 --> 01:22:52,740
you're a,

1286
01:22:53,020 --> 01:22:56,730
you're on to something dangerous and
people are gonna start watching you.

1287
01:22:56,731 --> 01:23:00,300
But the bottom line is,
is the second you recorded it and there's,

1288
01:23:01,290 --> 01:23:04,020
you know, I just look at what
Mel Gibson is going through,

1289
01:23:05,680 --> 01:23:09,490
what he's going through with the
recorded shit that he's fucking said.

1290
01:23:10,180 --> 01:23:12,070
I'm not saying I said
anything racist or anything,

1291
01:23:12,071 --> 01:23:14,680
but everything that I've done in the
podcast and last three fucking years,

1292
01:23:14,890 --> 01:23:19,480
I could never pull a Schwartzenegger.
Let's just fucking just like totally

1293
01:23:20,440 --> 01:23:21,850
get into fantasy here.

1294
01:23:21,851 --> 01:23:26,851
Let's pretend that I actually somehow
became a huge fucking movie star.

1295
01:23:26,950 --> 01:23:31,240
Did it for 20 years and then got sick
of it and decided to run for political

1296
01:23:31,241 --> 01:23:32,074
office.

1297
01:23:32,110 --> 01:23:36,190
You could pick any one of my podcast and
that would be the end of the campaign.

1298
01:23:37,060 --> 01:23:37,893
You know,

1299
01:23:38,140 --> 01:23:41,560
especially those ones early on when I
said con to every other fucking word,

1300
01:23:43,090 --> 01:23:47,980
I just, I go through phases. I
didn't, I got into golf for a minute.

1301
01:23:47,981 --> 01:23:49,930
I got into conspiracy theory for a minute.

1302
01:23:50,260 --> 01:23:54,130
I got into saying confirm
minute and I don't know,

1303
01:23:54,131 --> 01:23:56,620
it just all goes by the fucking wayside.

1304
01:23:56,680 --> 01:23:59,500
This is one of the reasons why I
can't sustain a fucking relationship,

1305
01:24:00,370 --> 01:24:04,940
although I've been able to sustain
this one. You know, I finally realized,

1306
01:24:05,880 --> 01:24:09,340
uh, I'm, I'm, I'm going to stop fucking
running like that fucking Eagle Song.

1307
01:24:10,500 --> 01:24:15,160
That's stupid song. Desperado you
know, I would like to do that.

1308
01:24:15,540 --> 01:24:15,541
Five.

1309
01:24:15,541 --> 01:24:19,820
We'd like to do a three stooges slapped
to everybody in the eagles is great of,

1310
01:24:19,830 --> 01:24:23,860
of musicians that they are those
cheese balls, songs that they wrote

1311
01:24:27,200 --> 01:24:28,390
days the Ratto.

1312
01:24:29,110 --> 01:24:34,060
Why don't you call to your
[inaudible] shut up Don Henley.

1313
01:24:35,200 --> 01:24:38,050
Just play the fucking drums.
Why don't you make a good fucking song?

1314
01:24:39,040 --> 01:24:42,970
This song's a class I wanted.
Whatever the fuck. Who am I kidding?

1315
01:24:43,690 --> 01:24:47,230
I'd love to be making the fucking
bank. Those guys are making, you know,

1316
01:24:47,500 --> 01:24:50,200
I'm going to warn you guys, bear when I
make some fucking money in this business,

1317
01:24:50,430 --> 01:24:55,120
I'm going to sell out like you've never
seen anybody sell out in your fucking

1318
01:24:55,121 --> 01:24:59,920
life. I don't know what I'm gonna
do, but I'm going to tap out.

1319
01:24:59,950 --> 01:25:04,240
I know I am. I'm going to buy a modest
house in the middle of fucking nowhere.

1320
01:25:04,390 --> 01:25:07,600
I was actually looking at property
in like Wyoming and Montana.

1321
01:25:07,900 --> 01:25:09,220
I'm getting into that shit.

1322
01:25:10,300 --> 01:25:15,300
Having a fucking ranch couple of fucking
Jakks goddamn pig that you can boot in

1323
01:25:17,201 --> 01:25:20,020
the ass when your well water
isn't coming up that day.

1324
01:25:20,590 --> 01:25:25,480
Fucking shit ain't working.
Thing running over the hill.

1325
01:25:25,970 --> 01:25:30,830
Who's going to report you? You're
out there by yourself, dude.

1326
01:25:30,831 --> 01:25:35,620
You live in fucking Wyoming or Montana.
You get yourself a spread.

1327
01:25:36,250 --> 01:25:40,150
You know you might as,
it's like you have your own country

1328
01:25:42,220 --> 01:25:46,390
just walk around naked on your property.
Nothing but you and your fucking, it's

1329
01:25:50,650 --> 01:25:55,650
just shooting shit slowly go and crazy
best friends with like a pheasant.

1330
01:25:57,330 --> 01:26:00,250
You know,
I fucking love it.

1331
01:26:01,390 --> 01:26:04,070
Learn how to grow fucking
vegetables and shit.

1332
01:26:05,480 --> 01:26:07,790
You want to stand that I'll
fucking awesome. That would be,

1333
01:26:07,910 --> 01:26:11,270
because I'll still do standup.
Just listen to this.

1334
01:26:11,271 --> 01:26:15,920
This is the fucking dream that for
some reason this week I'm totally into,

1335
01:26:15,930 --> 01:26:17,180
I'm going to live like that.

1336
01:26:17,510 --> 01:26:22,510
And then every other week I get to leave
the Ponderosa and then I fly into a

1337
01:26:22,761 --> 01:26:26,450
fucking metropolis.
Right. Get the, you know,

1338
01:26:26,451 --> 01:26:30,710
hang out with everybody who's living
on top of one another. You know,

1339
01:26:31,190 --> 01:26:36,020
soak up that vibe for a minute. Hang
an extra day, go to a football game,

1340
01:26:36,830 --> 01:26:39,950
you know, eat somebody barbecue
that they claim is the greatest,

1341
01:26:39,951 --> 01:26:44,780
but it's always some dried out fucking
ribs and chicken with some sweet sauce.

1342
01:26:44,781 --> 01:26:49,610
The sauce always tastes the best. The
MITO, we sucks. You know, once again,

1343
01:26:50,090 --> 01:26:53,270
I had some more smoked fucking barbecue
when I or whatever the hell it is.

1344
01:26:53,271 --> 01:26:54,104
I always eat it.

1345
01:26:54,530 --> 01:26:57,800
I always believe like this is going to
be the one that's gonna make me like it.

1346
01:26:59,750 --> 01:27:02,650
Um, anyways. Nah Dude,

1347
01:27:02,660 --> 01:27:07,250
I would love to fucking do that shit.
I don't know if I could do it.

1348
01:27:07,280 --> 01:27:10,940
I don't know if I could live way
out in the middle of nowhere.

1349
01:27:12,860 --> 01:27:17,090
Um, but I'm telling you
man, that, that really the,

1350
01:27:17,091 --> 01:27:22,091
the longer I'm in this business and the
longer I'm on flights and I'm sitting

1351
01:27:23,001 --> 01:27:26,900
next to people with fucking flakes behind
their ears and they're getting up and

1352
01:27:26,901 --> 01:27:31,901
they're walking to the bathroom without
their fucking shoes on and I'm listening

1353
01:27:32,331 --> 01:27:36,470
to the male stewardess on the Mike,
we have a very full flight,

1354
01:27:39,080 --> 01:27:42,470
you know, if he can feet, if he can feed,

1355
01:27:42,500 --> 01:27:45,620
if they can fit in the
seat and friendly view,

1356
01:27:46,290 --> 01:27:50,000
please be Korean style and people
on the flight. And they never are.

1357
01:27:50,600 --> 01:27:54,890
They never are.
People up there just stick and shit.

1358
01:27:54,891 --> 01:27:58,760
They could easily fit in front of the
seat in front of them. And I swear to God,

1359
01:27:58,830 --> 01:27:59,920
and he'll be like,
John Denver,

1360
01:27:59,950 --> 01:28:04,290
I learn how to fly a plane and by some
experimental fucking thing and crashing

1361
01:28:04,410 --> 01:28:06,230
into the side of a mountain.
That's the thing though. That's,

1362
01:28:06,231 --> 01:28:10,460
that's the ultimate right there
that the, I'll tell you right now,

1363
01:28:10,700 --> 01:28:13,160
if you guys want to know what
it's like to do the fucking road,

1364
01:28:13,430 --> 01:28:14,360
and I'm telling you right now,

1365
01:28:14,361 --> 01:28:18,680
I know salesman and people with
corporate jobs who have to fly around the

1366
01:28:18,681 --> 01:28:19,400
country.

1367
01:28:19,400 --> 01:28:24,260
What you do after a while as
you fantasize about the way,

1368
01:28:25,460 --> 01:28:26,780
um,
you want to do the road.

1369
01:28:27,080 --> 01:28:31,700
If you could do the fucking
road and I would love it.

1370
01:28:32,030 --> 01:28:35,090
I don't know if I could live in fucking
in the middle of nowhere like that, but,

1371
01:28:35,091 --> 01:28:38,540
well, let's just say I could,
so this would be the deal.

1372
01:28:39,650 --> 01:28:43,190
I live in the middle of nowhere
on the fucking Ponderosa, right?

1373
01:28:43,610 --> 01:28:46,610
Woodburn and stove.
It's,

1374
01:28:46,670 --> 01:28:50,630
it's like it's a fucking log cabin,
but you still got the flat screen.

1375
01:28:51,440 --> 01:28:55,280
I'll build a fucking ice rink out
back for the kids that I don't have,

1376
01:28:55,970 --> 01:28:56,803
you know,

1377
01:28:59,000 --> 01:29:02,130
have like four fucking dogs
because who gives a shit?

1378
01:29:03,210 --> 01:29:06,030
You buy a mansion for
like 1200 bucks out there.

1379
01:29:06,450 --> 01:29:11,430
Have like four fucking dogs.
Keep I get Guy Cleo.

1380
01:29:11,580 --> 01:29:14,910
I'll get a fucking, okay. Pitbull boxer,

1381
01:29:15,120 --> 01:29:19,470
a fucking bulldog.
And then what else I get a month.

1382
01:29:19,500 --> 01:29:22,440
I mean a bloodhound.
Yeah,

1383
01:29:22,610 --> 01:29:26,370
something that likes to howl but
also likes to lay around, you know,

1384
01:29:27,420 --> 01:29:30,330
do my MTV cribs around and
have a bunch of fucking cars.

1385
01:29:30,420 --> 01:29:33,900
I'll have the baddest of the
Lamborghini, the Ferrari, the Porsche,

1386
01:29:34,410 --> 01:29:37,050
and the fucking dodge challenger.
A dog's right.

1387
01:29:37,051 --> 01:29:40,530
Line them up in my fucking dirt driveway,

1388
01:29:44,790 --> 01:29:49,590
you know, and then down the street
somehow I'd have my own pride. This is,

1389
01:29:49,591 --> 01:29:53,400
this is the ultimate, right? I'd
have my own fucking private jet. Oh.

1390
01:29:53,401 --> 01:29:56,580
Meanwhile the business is also
sending me fucking movie scripts.

1391
01:29:56,610 --> 01:30:00,990
Just offer me begging me, begging
me, not only to be in the movie,

1392
01:30:01,170 --> 01:30:05,280
but all I got to be is like the fucking
six to lead. And when I show up,

1393
01:30:05,370 --> 01:30:09,480
they shoot all my shit. You
know, you have me for five days,

1394
01:30:09,481 --> 01:30:13,560
shoot all my fucking scenes and I'm that
guy who was in the movie like fucking

1395
01:30:13,561 --> 01:30:18,150
three, four times, but kills it. So I
keep my career going. This is the dream.

1396
01:30:18,900 --> 01:30:22,580
Then I live in the middle of nowhere.
I fucking make my fucking, ah,

1397
01:30:23,720 --> 01:30:25,860
got my garden in the back.
Fresh vegetables,

1398
01:30:26,130 --> 01:30:30,150
got chicken coop every once in awhile.
Who wants a fucking Burrito?

1399
01:30:30,180 --> 01:30:32,820
Hang on a second. I'm going to
go wring the neck of something.

1400
01:30:32,821 --> 01:30:35,940
You grab it and you're fucking
by the neck is how you do it.

1401
01:30:35,941 --> 01:30:40,500
You grabbed by the neck and then you
spin their fucking body around and that's

1402
01:30:40,501 --> 01:30:42,300
it.
All right.

1403
01:30:42,930 --> 01:30:46,380
You have your oldest son named John
Boy and you haven't plucked the shit.

1404
01:30:49,500 --> 01:30:53,520
You stick it in the set it and forget it.
You kept it as a joke,

1405
01:30:53,521 --> 01:30:56,220
as a reminder of civilization.
You fucking eat that way.

1406
01:30:56,340 --> 01:31:01,110
And then whenever I got a Gig, I go
down the fucking street down the street,

1407
01:31:01,111 --> 01:31:04,860
whatever,
rural road number 47 and there's the,

1408
01:31:05,120 --> 01:31:09,300
and there's a fucking airport and I
got my own jet and pilots on call,

1409
01:31:10,230 --> 01:31:11,910
right?
And in the back of the plane,

1410
01:31:12,030 --> 01:31:15,150
that's just a big goddamn bed
with a huge fucking seatbelt.

1411
01:31:16,020 --> 01:31:19,990
And they fucking knocked me out.
If it's a long flight, if it isn't,

1412
01:31:20,040 --> 01:31:24,630
I just sit there shooting the shit
with the pilots and that's what I do.

1413
01:31:24,680 --> 01:31:29,430
And then I fly in, I do the Gig, and
then I fucking go to a sporting event.

1414
01:31:29,530 --> 01:31:31,350
Then I fly back.
That's my fucking dream.

1415
01:31:32,040 --> 01:31:36,900
That's my dream of how I'd like to do
the road. How do you like that? Huh?

1416
01:31:37,920 --> 01:31:39,450
Boozes got on the podcast,
isn't it?

1417
01:31:39,630 --> 01:31:42,630
I hope I'm not going to listen back to
this when I'm not buzzed and think that

1418
01:31:42,631 --> 01:31:46,700
this is fucked up, but that's
something I would like to do. Um,

1419
01:31:47,130 --> 01:31:48,000
but I gotta be honest with you,

1420
01:31:48,001 --> 01:31:52,470
I don't think that I could
live in a Wyoming or Montana.

1421
01:31:54,570 --> 01:31:57,510
Um,
I do think that I could live,

1422
01:31:59,080 --> 01:31:59,980
where can I live?
I

1423
01:31:59,980 --> 01:32:03,190
could live in parts of Pennsylvania,

1424
01:32:04,090 --> 01:32:07,000
Connecticut,
upstate New York,

1425
01:32:08,620 --> 01:32:10,450
parts of northern New Jersey.

1426
01:32:13,840 --> 01:32:15,910
Uh,
maybe western Massachusetts.

1427
01:32:18,340 --> 01:32:20,920
I Dunno.
Maybe Northern California.

1428
01:32:20,950 --> 01:32:25,180
We get up there and they got some
redwoods and shit. I don't know.

1429
01:32:25,181 --> 01:32:28,720
That's fucked up, man. It's scary. You
want to do something fucked up? Go, uh,

1430
01:32:29,440 --> 01:32:33,430
go on a, go on Google maps and just, uh,

1431
01:32:33,460 --> 01:32:37,510
just look at Montana and then just pick,
um,

1432
01:32:37,540 --> 01:32:41,830
pick a town and then hit
satellite and then just, you know,

1433
01:32:42,460 --> 01:32:46,390
dropped that little man and then just
go down a fucking street and you'll see

1434
01:32:46,391 --> 01:32:49,180
what it's like out there.
You know?

1435
01:32:49,270 --> 01:32:53,380
And if you don't hear a banjo music in
on a fucking human being, it's scary.

1436
01:32:53,500 --> 01:32:55,960
I'd love to go out there, man. I
want to check it out. You know,

1437
01:32:56,020 --> 01:32:57,820
just see what the fuck
is going on up there.

1438
01:32:58,210 --> 01:33:00,610
Actually know a guy who has
a gig out in fucking Montana.

1439
01:33:00,610 --> 01:33:03,190
I've actually was thinking about
doing it just cause I've never been,

1440
01:33:03,880 --> 01:33:06,550
never been out that way. Um, all right,

1441
01:33:06,551 --> 01:33:11,350
let's get on with the overrated underrated
now or continue with it. I should say.

1442
01:33:12,940 --> 01:33:17,710
Uh, do overrated. The word.
Oh, I this one. Overrated.

1443
01:33:17,750 --> 01:33:20,110
The use of the word countless.

1444
01:33:20,830 --> 01:33:22,900
I hear it on the news all the time.

1445
01:33:23,200 --> 01:33:27,070
This tragedy has left countless
numbers of people homeless.

1446
01:33:27,730 --> 01:33:32,680
That's bullshit. I think there are
like six or 7 billion people on earth.

1447
01:33:32,920 --> 01:33:37,570
I know the numeric system works.
I can count to 7 billion. Hell,

1448
01:33:37,780 --> 01:33:41,110
I could count to 7
trillion given enough time.

1449
01:33:41,440 --> 01:33:44,200
I'm not saying the tragedies
that happen aren't bad,

1450
01:33:44,350 --> 01:33:48,790
but trying to jack up the fear quotion
by making it sound like the number of

1451
01:33:48,791 --> 01:33:53,260
people affected is just too
big to comprehend is bullshit.

1452
01:33:54,040 --> 01:33:57,970
I liked that. I never noticed that.
Leaving countless people homeless.

1453
01:33:59,680 --> 01:34:02,530
Uh, what do you mean by the
actually 1,247? Well, you know what?

1454
01:34:02,531 --> 01:34:03,700
I think I could count that high.

1455
01:34:05,650 --> 01:34:09,250
Are you saying that you don't care
about the homeless? No. You dumb cunt.

1456
01:34:10,090 --> 01:34:14,300
I'm saying that I can count that
high. So it's not countless. 1200 is,

1457
01:34:14,490 --> 01:34:19,360
it's countable leaving countable people
homeless. This guy is absolutely right.

1458
01:34:19,361 --> 01:34:22,510
Or this woman, whoever wrote
it in absolutely fucking right.

1459
01:34:22,990 --> 01:34:27,850
You are absolutely fucking correct
on that one. Uh, underrated, uh,

1460
01:34:27,910 --> 01:34:29,800
animated shows on TV today.

1461
01:34:29,801 --> 01:34:34,780
The Simpsons and family guy
are legitimately well done
shows and south park to a

1462
01:34:34,781 --> 01:34:37,990
lesser degree. Dude, I think
South Park is still the best.

1463
01:34:38,920 --> 01:34:41,800
I'd go South Park,
the Simpsons and then the family guy.

1464
01:34:42,160 --> 01:34:46,930
South Park has the best social commentary
on TV. But I have to tell you this,

1465
01:34:46,931 --> 01:34:51,220
I don't watch that show. What the
fuck is it? I always mean to watch it.

1466
01:34:51,221 --> 01:34:55,320
It comes on Sunday night. The, um,

1467
01:34:56,300 --> 01:35:00,890
I had, fuck do I describe
it? It's the, uh,

1468
01:35:00,950 --> 01:35:04,670
African American one. There
we go. Come on. You know it.

1469
01:35:05,420 --> 01:35:07,580
I don't know what it is,
but I heard that one is the shit.

1470
01:35:07,850 --> 01:35:12,320
What the fuck is the name of it? I can't
remember. I heard that one's awesome.

1471
01:35:12,321 --> 01:35:15,590
I got to get into watching that. I always
say I'm going to, and then I never do.

1472
01:35:16,670 --> 01:35:20,180
And there's also a billboard I've seen
on sunset boulevard out here for that

1473
01:35:20,181 --> 01:35:23,030
show. Children's hospital.
It looks creepy as hell.

1474
01:35:23,330 --> 01:35:27,380
And it's on a adult swim.
That's what I'm trying to say.

1475
01:35:27,381 --> 01:35:31,730
Adult swim is what that other, the
Boondocks, right? Is that the name of it?

1476
01:35:32,000 --> 01:35:35,120
And then there's the, um, I heard
that children's hospital is great.

1477
01:35:36,020 --> 01:35:39,610
I want to check that one out too.
Alright. Ah, what are we doing? Well,

1478
01:35:39,620 --> 01:35:43,880
where are we going? Ah, they, AH, okay.
Um, cartoons that they have good writing,

1479
01:35:43,881 --> 01:35:47,720
good plot points and legitimate
social commentary. Totally
agree. And all of that.

1480
01:35:48,710 --> 01:35:50,150
This is what pisses me off though.

1481
01:35:50,450 --> 01:35:54,320
I can tell you that the number of times
that someone will ask me what I've

1482
01:35:54,321 --> 01:35:58,130
watched on television, I will give
them the plot of a Simpsons episode,

1483
01:35:58,250 --> 01:36:01,610
not mentioning any names,
um,

1484
01:36:01,640 --> 01:36:05,810
or the fact that it's a cartoon and they
will tell me how funny they think it is.

1485
01:36:05,870 --> 01:36:08,780
But then when I tell them it's
the Simpsons of the family guy,

1486
01:36:08,810 --> 01:36:10,790
it's a Simpson or a family guy episode.

1487
01:36:11,060 --> 01:36:15,890
All of a sudden they turn their noses
up and say that they're adults and they

1488
01:36:15,891 --> 01:36:19,970
don't watch cartoons anymore.
What the fuck is up with that?

1489
01:36:20,030 --> 01:36:22,760
A funny show is a funny show,
Dude. I couldn't agree with more.

1490
01:36:23,330 --> 01:36:24,320
I couldn't agree with you more.

1491
01:36:25,640 --> 01:36:29,030
Let me take the last fucking Swig
here and I'm going to, uh, I'm gonna,

1492
01:36:29,060 --> 01:36:32,360
I'm gonna Finish this thing off and
I'm going to finish up the podcast. Um,

1493
01:36:33,260 --> 01:36:37,220
here's something that I have learned
on a, on the podcast. Hang on a second.

1494
01:36:37,221 --> 01:36:40,220
Here we go. Let me get a little
more, a little more happy juice here.

1495
01:36:43,740 --> 01:36:45,990
Oh God. Damn. That's fucking perfect. Um,

1496
01:36:48,140 --> 01:36:50,620
anyways, oh, by the way, uh,

1497
01:36:51,260 --> 01:36:54,600
I've been watching a lot of
the old Jackie Gleason. Um,

1498
01:36:54,601 --> 01:36:57,800
I used to watch him when I was a kid
and I never really noticed how many the,

1499
01:36:57,860 --> 01:37:01,880
the older shows,
it was weird.

1500
01:37:01,881 --> 01:37:04,250
I don't know what it was
because I came up in the 70s.

1501
01:37:04,970 --> 01:37:08,480
You have to understand that a lot of
the original shows weren't filmed,

1502
01:37:08,930 --> 01:37:13,400
so there was no syndication. That was
the brilliance of Ricky Ricardo there.

1503
01:37:15,030 --> 01:37:19,400
Uh, what's his face there? Ricky
Ricardo was his character name. Um,

1504
01:37:20,330 --> 01:37:25,330
Desi Arnaz that he actually
had the brilliance to film.

1505
01:37:26,150 --> 01:37:30,410
I love you. I love Lucy and get
the rights for the old episodes.

1506
01:37:30,411 --> 01:37:35,411
Like nobody in the business for saw
the money in reruns and they just,

1507
01:37:35,841 --> 01:37:39,170
they signed off and just gave him to
them basically for fucking nothing.

1508
01:37:39,500 --> 01:37:44,470
So anyways, there wasn't a lot of reruns.
Certainly from the 1950s. There's,

1509
01:37:44,620 --> 01:37:49,370
you know, a lot of those live shows, they
just went live and that was it. But, um,

1510
01:37:49,430 --> 01:37:53,930
so like, what am I trying to say? And
actually television was this how old I am?

1511
01:37:53,931 --> 01:37:56,040
Television for the most
as far as the golden

1512
01:37:56,040 --> 01:37:56,880
age of television,

1513
01:37:57,150 --> 01:38:01,630
right up was only 20 years old
and there was only three networks.

1514
01:38:01,710 --> 01:38:03,540
So you basically got the best of the best.

1515
01:38:03,541 --> 01:38:05,580
And I used to watch like
the Jackie Gleason show,

1516
01:38:05,581 --> 01:38:08,340
they used to show reruns
of the Dean Martin show.

1517
01:38:08,341 --> 01:38:10,890
I know this makes me sound like
I'm older than fucking dirt,

1518
01:38:10,891 --> 01:38:14,340
but they used to play it. They used
to play all that shit, three stooges,

1519
01:38:14,341 --> 01:38:15,210
all that type of shit.

1520
01:38:15,211 --> 01:38:18,780
And I used to watch the Jackie Gleason
show and he had this character,

1521
01:38:18,781 --> 01:38:21,900
Reginald van Gleason.
And um,

1522
01:38:23,220 --> 01:38:26,250
I don't know the character,
he just had this little broom mustache.

1523
01:38:26,730 --> 01:38:30,460
And before he would say anything
he would of sort of hum. Hmm.

1524
01:38:30,600 --> 01:38:31,980
And then say whatever he said.

1525
01:38:31,981 --> 01:38:34,320
And I watched one the other
day where he was playing, uh,

1526
01:38:34,840 --> 01:38:38,670
he's trying to solve a murder mystery
and he comes walking in on this couple is

1527
01:38:38,671 --> 01:38:42,000
a dead body in there. And, uh,

1528
01:38:42,330 --> 01:38:46,140
but before we start questioning
them about the murder,

1529
01:38:46,740 --> 01:38:50,580
he actually sees a wet bar.
So he just puts his index finger up.

1530
01:38:50,581 --> 01:38:54,420
This is why I'd love to buy
Jackie Gleason was how, um,

1531
01:38:54,600 --> 01:38:58,740
without saying anything, he freaking
could go for like, you know,

1532
01:38:58,920 --> 01:39:02,610
minutes on ends without saying anything
and just have you die in laughing.

1533
01:39:03,390 --> 01:39:06,150
And He, and, and he never rehearsed
either. And he just fought.

1534
01:39:06,151 --> 01:39:11,151
He puts his finger up and after he sees
the bar and he walks over to the wet bar

1535
01:39:11,281 --> 01:39:15,720
and he does all this exaggerated
shit of making the drink,

1536
01:39:15,721 --> 01:39:19,470
but before he walks in
with a second, he's, I'm to
explaining this wrong, whatever,

1537
01:39:19,740 --> 01:39:24,410
he comes walking over to the bar, the
second he sees it, he just goes, hmm,

1538
01:39:25,740 --> 01:39:30,600
booze. Right? And it gets this
huge fucking laugh. I don't know.

1539
01:39:30,690 --> 01:39:33,090
I don't know. The, I just
loved that old school shit.

1540
01:39:33,090 --> 01:39:37,950
We're fucking drinking and having
a drinking problem is funny.

1541
01:39:38,040 --> 01:39:38,580
This guy,

1542
01:39:38,580 --> 01:39:42,000
this is a dead body in the room and
he's gonna make himself a drink first.

1543
01:39:42,001 --> 01:39:46,440
He obviously has his preop priorities
around a fucking whack and nobody gives a

1544
01:39:46,441 --> 01:39:50,880
shit. So whatever. But anyways, this last
week of this podcast, I really learned,

1545
01:39:50,881 --> 01:39:53,670
man, uh, how to do, uh,

1546
01:39:54,120 --> 01:39:57,600
if I ever want to do a fucking radio show,
there's three,

1547
01:39:57,630 --> 01:40:02,630
there's three topics that get me the
most email responses of either I totally

1548
01:40:05,371 --> 01:40:08,220
agree with you or you're fucking
annoying the shit out of me.

1549
01:40:08,250 --> 01:40:10,500
And they are politics,

1550
01:40:10,710 --> 01:40:15,570
sports and uh,
and Jesus or any sort of religion.

1551
01:40:15,571 --> 01:40:20,490
If I go off on any of
those like, uh, you know,

1552
01:40:20,550 --> 01:40:24,240
trashing the fucking, uh, Lebron on
trusting what did I do a few weeks ago,

1553
01:40:24,241 --> 01:40:27,780
I trashed, um, New York and the Knicks.

1554
01:40:27,781 --> 01:40:30,780
I got all these fucking emails
from Knicks fans, you know,

1555
01:40:30,781 --> 01:40:35,160
last week I trashed the fucking, uh,
I didn't think I trashed the Lakers.

1556
01:40:35,160 --> 01:40:39,300
I thought I was just talking
about Kobe versus um, um, Jordan,

1557
01:40:39,780 --> 01:40:42,360
but are all these fucking Laker fans,

1558
01:40:42,390 --> 01:40:47,310
just fucking writing in
writing and capital letters,

1559
01:40:47,311 --> 01:40:50,880
flipping the fuck out.
And uh, I don't know.

1560
01:40:51,660 --> 01:40:54,590
This podcast has been
very in like the end,

1561
01:40:54,600 --> 01:40:59,290
like that level where it's like a,
if I ever do a fucking radio show,

1562
01:40:59,291 --> 01:41:00,220
which I don't think I will,

1563
01:41:00,221 --> 01:41:03,900
I like doing this shit better and I
always felt when I did on informed,

1564
01:41:03,910 --> 01:41:05,560
when we were actually able
to do episodes of that,

1565
01:41:05,561 --> 01:41:09,270
I always felt the collars
slowed down the show, you know,

1566
01:41:09,271 --> 01:41:11,460
and it was so many people just
fucking with you or whatever.

1567
01:41:11,461 --> 01:41:12,660
But if I ever get a situation,

1568
01:41:12,661 --> 01:41:15,760
I have to do a radio show
and I want to get collars,

1569
01:41:15,780 --> 01:41:20,780
those are the three fucking magic topics
that just get people flipping the fuck

1570
01:41:22,341 --> 01:41:27,140
out. I guess the fourth would be a fee
if you trash one of the sexist, you know,

1571
01:41:27,440 --> 01:41:28,640
I don't know what the
fuck I'm saying here.

1572
01:41:28,641 --> 01:41:32,930
I'm just enjoying the nice buzz of one
fucking beer. That's a great thing to do.

1573
01:41:32,931 --> 01:41:34,790
Drink up,
drink a 16 ounce,

1574
01:41:35,860 --> 01:41:39,820
really good beer on an empty
fucking stomach, you know,

1575
01:41:40,260 --> 01:41:44,610
and do a God damn podcast and tell me
you're not proud to be a fucking American.

1576
01:41:45,500 --> 01:41:47,270
All right, that's it. Okay.

1577
01:41:47,271 --> 01:41:50,120
I think we had a little bit of something
for everybody here. Wind chimes,

1578
01:41:50,840 --> 01:41:52,870
booze reminiscing, telling you my, my,

1579
01:41:52,900 --> 01:41:55,610
my dreams of how I want to
live in the fucking future.

1580
01:41:56,600 --> 01:42:01,190
I guess none of which included having
a spouse or children. Fucking creepy.

1581
01:42:01,191 --> 01:42:03,350
Is that a,
that's it.

1582
01:42:03,351 --> 01:42:08,240
That's the podcast here that I
did it on a Thursday and I'm,

1583
01:42:08,241 --> 01:42:10,850
hopefully I'm going to try and
do Letterman again next week.

1584
01:42:11,170 --> 01:42:15,890
My set is more than ready to go and I'll
try to give you the heads up this time

1585
01:42:15,891 --> 01:42:20,580
if I have fight, get bumped up, but
whatever, it's actually, I actually,

1586
01:42:20,581 --> 01:42:23,700
I'm kind of psyched that I got bumped
because there's nothing cooler than going

1587
01:42:23,701 --> 01:42:27,330
to the Ed Sullivan Theater. It's just a
shit. And he just, he come up beforehand,

1588
01:42:27,690 --> 01:42:29,070
they show you where your mark is,

1589
01:42:29,370 --> 01:42:31,970
and as much as it's showing you where your
market is, you sit sitting there, God,

1590
01:42:31,980 --> 01:42:35,340
Jesus Christ, the fucking Beatles
were here, the stones were here,

1591
01:42:35,910 --> 01:42:39,450
the doors came as where the doors came
out, and then, and, and Jim Morrison,

1592
01:42:39,860 --> 01:42:44,070
whatever the fuck he wasn't supposed
to say. He said, it's incredible.

1593
01:42:44,130 --> 01:42:45,630
It's an incredible,
uh,

1594
01:42:45,790 --> 01:42:50,790
I'd say it's one of the few things left
in show business that is still as big as

1595
01:42:51,220 --> 01:42:54,790
show business was back in the day before
it all got splintered into like 400,

1596
01:42:55,240 --> 01:42:59,350
400 different, uh,
channels. Um, so whatever,

1597
01:42:59,380 --> 01:43:01,930
all you young comics out there who never
done let them, and I'm telling you,

1598
01:43:01,931 --> 01:43:06,670
it's not gonna fucking disappoint
you. It's a, it's a huge thrill.

1599
01:43:06,671 --> 01:43:07,910
And this is my fifth time doing it.

1600
01:43:07,940 --> 01:43:11,820
I'm beyond excited and I'm really
hoping I get to get on this weekend. Ah,

1601
01:43:11,830 --> 01:43:13,600
that's it.
That's the podcast for this week.

1602
01:43:14,470 --> 01:43:18,250
I hope all you guys
enjoyed it and we'll talk,

1603
01:43:18,430 --> 01:43:19,870
see you next week. Okay. Take it easy.

1604
01:43:51,910 --> 01:43:52,743
[inaudible]

1605
01:46:02,530 --> 01:46:02,530
[inaudible].
