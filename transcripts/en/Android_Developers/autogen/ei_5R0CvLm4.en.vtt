Ramon and Jake just talked you through

00:35:04.150 --> 00:35:04.160
Ramon and Jake just talked you through
 

00:35:04.160 --> 00:35:06.339
Ramon and Jake just talked you through
the language and library experiences to

00:35:06.339 --> 00:35:06.349
the language and library experiences to
 

00:35:06.349 --> 00:35:07.660
the language and library experiences to
build on top of that I'm going to talk

00:35:07.660 --> 00:35:07.670
build on top of that I'm going to talk
 

00:35:07.670 --> 00:35:09.069
build on top of that I'm going to talk
to you about productivity and what we're

00:35:09.069 --> 00:35:09.079
to you about productivity and what we're
 

00:35:09.079 --> 00:35:11.319
to you about productivity and what we're
doing with Android studio four three two

00:35:11.319 --> 00:35:11.329
doing with Android studio four three two
 

00:35:11.329 --> 00:35:14.829
doing with Android studio four three two
we asked ourselves what can we do to

00:35:14.829 --> 00:35:14.839
we asked ourselves what can we do to
 

00:35:14.839 --> 00:35:16.630
we asked ourselves what can we do to
have a meaningful impact on productivity

00:35:16.630 --> 00:35:16.640
have a meaningful impact on productivity
 

00:35:16.640 --> 00:35:18.819
have a meaningful impact on productivity
and where do you spend the most your

00:35:18.819 --> 00:35:18.829
and where do you spend the most your
 

00:35:18.829 --> 00:35:20.739
and where do you spend the most your
time we heard loud and clear

00:35:20.739 --> 00:35:20.749

something that you do every day you set

00:35:26.559 --> 00:35:26.569
something that you do every day you set

me up it's something you do every day
 

00:35:28.700 --> 00:35:30.579
me up it's something you do every day
multiple times a day and every minute

00:35:30.579 --> 00:35:30.589
multiple times a day and every minute

that you're waiting for that bill to

00:35:31.779 --> 00:35:31.789
that you're waiting for that bill to
 

00:35:31.789 --> 00:35:34.870
that you're waiting for that bill to
finish we know it's a minute wasted so

00:35:34.870 --> 00:35:34.880
finish we know it's a minute wasted so
 

00:35:34.880 --> 00:35:36.759

we took a deep look at our data to see

00:35:36.759 --> 00:35:36.769
we took a deep look at our data to see
 

00:35:36.769 --> 00:35:38.349
we took a deep look at our data to see
what was going on and we actually found

00:35:38.349 --> 00:35:38.359
what was going on and we actually found
 

00:35:38.359 --> 00:35:40.509
what was going on and we actually found
two things to be true the first thing we

00:35:40.509 --> 00:35:40.519
two things to be true the first thing we
 

00:35:40.519 --> 00:35:42.849
two things to be true the first thing we
found was that build speeds in our

00:35:42.849 --> 00:35:42.859
found was that build speeds in our
 

00:35:42.859 --> 00:35:44.890
found was that build speeds in our
opt-in data is actually getting slower

00:35:44.890 --> 00:35:44.900
opt-in data is actually getting slower
 

00:35:44.900 --> 00:35:47.289
opt-in data is actually getting slower
over time the second thing we found is

00:35:47.289 --> 00:35:47.299
over time the second thing we found is
 

00:35:47.299 --> 00:35:49.900
over time the second thing we found is
that new releases of studio are actually

00:35:49.900 --> 00:35:49.910
that new releases of studio are actually
 

00:35:49.910 --> 00:35:51.999
that new releases of studio are actually
improving build times in the last year

00:35:51.999 --> 00:35:52.009
improving build times in the last year
 

00:35:52.009 --> 00:35:53.499
improving build times in the last year
and a half we saw build speeds get

00:35:53.499 --> 00:35:53.509
and a half we saw build speeds get
 

00:35:53.509 --> 00:35:56.799
and a half we saw build speeds get
faster by 42% on fresh projects so

00:35:56.799 --> 00:35:56.809
faster by 42% on fresh projects so
 

00:35:56.809 --> 00:35:58.569
faster by 42% on fresh projects so
something's going on and we had to take

00:35:58.569 --> 00:35:58.579
something's going on and we had to take
 

00:35:58.579 --> 00:36:02.079
something's going on and we had to take
a deeper look code bases are just

00:36:02.079 --> 00:36:02.089
a deeper look code bases are just
 

00:36:02.089 --> 00:36:04.779
a deeper look code bases are just
getting larger custom plugins are adding

00:36:04.779 --> 00:36:04.789
getting larger custom plugins are adding
 

00:36:04.789 --> 00:36:06.910
getting larger custom plugins are adding
to build times annotation processors

00:36:06.910 --> 00:36:06.920
to build times annotation processors
 

00:36:06.920 --> 00:36:09.450

builds new languages can add to

00:36:13.479 --> 00:36:13.489
builds new languages can add to
 

00:36:13.489 --> 00:36:15.549
builds new languages can add to
compilation times and if you have many

00:36:15.549 --> 00:36:15.559
compilation times and if you have many
 

00:36:15.559 --> 00:36:17.650

modules resource management can add time

00:36:17.650 --> 00:36:17.660
modules resource management can add time
 

00:36:17.660 --> 00:36:20.049
modules resource management can add time
as well the ecosystem and project growth

00:36:20.049 --> 00:36:20.059
as well the ecosystem and project growth
 

00:36:20.059 --> 00:36:21.789
as well the ecosystem and project growth
are kind of outgrowing our build

00:36:21.789 --> 00:36:21.799
are kind of outgrowing our build
 

00:36:21.799 --> 00:36:24.279
are kind of outgrowing our build
improvements we are committed to making
