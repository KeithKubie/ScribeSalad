GUEST SPEAKER: Great.

00:00:11.770 --> 00:00:14.380
Thank you very much,
everyone, for the opportunity

00:00:14.380 --> 00:00:16.740
to present some
of the strategies

00:00:16.740 --> 00:00:19.965
that we can use to influence
federal policy making in

00:00:19.965 --> 00:00:22.492
regards to renewable energy.

00:00:22.492 --> 00:00:23.950
So first of all,
I'm just give you,

00:00:23.950 --> 00:00:27.190
just going to give you a brief
overview of the presentation

00:00:27.190 --> 00:00:27.740
today.

00:00:27.740 --> 00:00:29.770
So first, I'm going
to talk a little bit

00:00:29.770 --> 00:00:31.420
about some background
information

00:00:31.420 --> 00:00:35.456
about climate change regulation
here in the United States.

00:00:35.456 --> 00:00:37.330
Then I'm going to give
you a general overview

00:00:37.330 --> 00:00:39.070
about the policy making process.

00:00:39.070 --> 00:00:42.058
And with that, I'm going to
give you specific strategies

00:00:42.058 --> 00:00:46.665
that we can use to employ
and increase employments

00:00:46.665 --> 00:00:49.190
over federal policy making.

00:00:49.190 --> 00:00:52.990
So just briefly, the three
strategies are, first one,

00:00:52.990 --> 00:00:56.500
take advantage of the
political momentum.

00:00:56.500 --> 00:00:58.720
The second one is to
frame climate change

00:00:58.720 --> 00:01:01.730
as both an energy issue
and as a health issue.

00:01:01.730 --> 00:01:03.610
And the third one
will be to focus

00:01:03.610 --> 00:01:08.870
on tax credit for investments
in renewable energy production.

00:01:08.870 --> 00:01:12.970
So as a way of a
background, as you know,

00:01:12.970 --> 00:01:15.760
renewable resources and
climate change regulation

00:01:15.760 --> 00:01:18.220
are closely linked.

00:01:18.220 --> 00:01:21.370
So unfortunately,
climate change regulation

00:01:21.370 --> 00:01:26.410
is, congressional action on
climate change is stalled.

00:01:26.410 --> 00:01:30.770
However, the federal
government and President Obama,

00:01:30.770 --> 00:01:35.440
more specifically, recently
proposed regulation to cut--

00:01:35.440 --> 00:01:38.620
and the wording is,
carbon pollution

00:01:38.620 --> 00:01:44.680
from power plants
in 30% by 2030.

00:01:44.680 --> 00:01:47.740
So this is a very
big opportunity.

00:01:47.740 --> 00:01:51.760
And as you can see
in the diagram,

00:01:51.760 --> 00:01:57.266
I'm just going to talk about
three phases, if you will.

00:01:57.266 --> 00:01:58.640
There are more
phases after that.

00:01:58.640 --> 00:02:02.590
But it's agenda setting, policy
formulation, policy option.

00:02:02.590 --> 00:02:05.470
So the first thing that
you, that's important

00:02:05.470 --> 00:02:10.139
is that this is
not a sequential--

00:02:10.139 --> 00:02:15.250
line of-- policy making.

00:02:15.250 --> 00:02:18.910
Even though we do have some
legislation on renewable energy

00:02:18.910 --> 00:02:22.600
and tax credit, we
are still, we still

00:02:22.600 --> 00:02:25.910
have to take advantage of
the agenda setting phase

00:02:25.910 --> 00:02:29.220
and the policy formulation
and the policy adoption.

00:02:29.220 --> 00:02:31.760
So the first strategy
that I talked

00:02:31.760 --> 00:02:33.770
about before, which
is take advantage

00:02:33.770 --> 00:02:38.900
of the political momentum,
is that we have to make sure

00:02:38.900 --> 00:02:43.550
that we take advantage of
the fact that climate change

00:02:43.550 --> 00:02:46.010
is now permanent in
the media, not only

00:02:46.010 --> 00:02:55.330
because of this announcement
of this new push for regulation

00:02:55.330 --> 00:02:57.960
of power plant emission.

00:02:57.960 --> 00:03:03.680
But also-- we have to make sure
that the United Nations climate

00:03:03.680 --> 00:03:07.370
summit creates also
this opportunity for us

00:03:07.370 --> 00:03:12.280
to put this, the action
on renewable energy

00:03:12.280 --> 00:03:14.500
and the political agenda.

00:03:14.500 --> 00:03:18.730
The second strategy will be
to frame renewable energy

00:03:18.730 --> 00:03:21.380
as both a climate change
issue and a health issue.

00:03:21.380 --> 00:03:27.380
So as I said before,
President Obama's announcement

00:03:27.380 --> 00:03:30.710
was targeting health
issues, or climate change

00:03:30.710 --> 00:03:32.030
as a public health issue.

00:03:32.030 --> 00:03:33.530
So I think that's
an interesting way

00:03:33.530 --> 00:03:39.860
to frame our policy
proposals and use

00:03:39.860 --> 00:03:42.377
this framing that
was already given

00:03:42.377 --> 00:03:43.460
by the federal government.

00:03:43.460 --> 00:03:46.040
But we can use it
in our advantage.

00:03:46.040 --> 00:03:50.330
By reducing fossil fuel
use, we can actually

00:03:50.330 --> 00:03:53.760
increase public health.

00:03:53.760 --> 00:03:57.890
So also, just remembering
that the issue is already

00:03:57.890 --> 00:03:59.360
part of the
institutional agenda,

00:03:59.360 --> 00:04:01.880
meaning that renewable
energy and tax

00:04:01.880 --> 00:04:04.010
credit for renewable
energy production

00:04:04.010 --> 00:04:07.700
is already part of the
institutional agenda

00:04:07.700 --> 00:04:10.580
because there's already
regulation in place.

00:04:10.580 --> 00:04:16.610
Unfortunately, the tax
credit will expire by 2016.

00:04:16.610 --> 00:04:20.390
So we need to make sure that
it continues in the agenda

00:04:20.390 --> 00:04:25.340
and propose the tax credit
in the policy formulation

00:04:25.340 --> 00:04:30.950
and make sure that is
adopted after it expires.

00:04:30.950 --> 00:04:34.790
So just briefly, I'm
just going to give you

00:04:34.790 --> 00:04:39.130
five reasons why a tax
credit is a important policy

00:04:39.130 --> 00:04:41.120
instrument in this case.

00:04:41.120 --> 00:04:45.230
First of all, it's the only
issue that you all agree on.

00:04:45.230 --> 00:04:48.650
So I think the fact that
this coalition actually

00:04:48.650 --> 00:04:52.250
has a consensus on
one policy instrument

00:04:52.250 --> 00:04:54.140
is a very important
political tool

00:04:54.140 --> 00:04:56.840
that we can use to actually
tell Congress, well,

00:04:56.840 --> 00:05:00.210
this is what we agree
on, all sides of--

00:05:02.870 --> 00:05:04.070
this issue.

00:05:04.070 --> 00:05:08.480
And second, there is
no direct expenditure.

00:05:08.480 --> 00:05:11.720
So basically, tax
credit is an investment.

00:05:11.720 --> 00:05:16.550
There is no additional
expenditure.

00:05:16.550 --> 00:05:20.160
Third, it's easier to
administrate because we already

00:05:20.160 --> 00:05:23.196
have the institutional
framework in place.

00:05:23.196 --> 00:05:24.820
And we already have
tax credits anyway.

00:05:24.820 --> 00:05:28.110
It's not a new, a
brand new proposal.

00:05:28.110 --> 00:05:33.480
And fourth, it's technically
and politically feasible.

00:05:33.480 --> 00:05:37.770
So we just have to make
sure that we tell Congress

00:05:37.770 --> 00:05:40.890
that there's regulations
already in place.

00:05:40.890 --> 00:05:44.520
It's, renewable energy
is technically feasible.

00:05:44.520 --> 00:05:47.160
And so we just need
more incentives

00:05:47.160 --> 00:05:50.850
to actually invest
in renewable energy

00:05:50.850 --> 00:05:54.360
and make sure that better
regulation that was proposed

00:05:54.360 --> 00:06:00.210
by President Obama actually
has a positive impact

00:06:00.210 --> 00:06:03.390
on renewable energy production.

00:06:03.390 --> 00:06:04.940
Thank you.
