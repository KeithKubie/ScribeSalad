TIMOTHY JORDAN: Hello,
I'm Timothy Jordan,

00:00:01.810 --> 00:00:04.143
and this is your update about
the coolest developer news

00:00:04.143 --> 00:00:06.070
from Google in the last week.

00:00:06.070 --> 00:00:08.280
The room and lifecycle
Architecture Components

00:00:08.280 --> 00:00:10.900
libraries have
reached 1.0 stable,

00:00:10.900 --> 00:00:13.974
which means they are ready for
production apps and libraries.

00:00:13.974 --> 00:00:15.390
These foundational
components make

00:00:15.390 --> 00:00:19.230
it possible to write modular
apps with less boilerplate code

00:00:19.230 --> 00:00:21.480
so you can focus on
innovating instead

00:00:21.480 --> 00:00:23.070
of reinventing the wheel.

00:00:23.070 --> 00:00:25.890
You can get started with the
post linked in the description

00:00:25.890 --> 00:00:27.350
below.

00:00:27.350 --> 00:00:32.040
In 11.6.0 of the Google
Play Services SDK,

00:00:32.040 --> 00:00:34.620
we're introducing a major
change in the APIs meant

00:00:34.620 --> 00:00:37.440
to make them easier
to use, thread safe,

00:00:37.440 --> 00:00:39.580
and more memory efficient.

00:00:39.580 --> 00:00:42.180
We've deprecated the
Google API client class

00:00:42.180 --> 00:00:44.310
and introduced a
de-coupled collection

00:00:44.310 --> 00:00:46.800
of feature-specific API clients.

00:00:46.800 --> 00:00:50.380
All the details and sample
code are on the post.

00:00:50.380 --> 00:00:52.890
TensorFlow 1.4 is now available.

00:00:52.890 --> 00:00:57.300
Included in the changes,
both Keras and datasets

00:00:57.300 --> 00:01:00.030
have graduated to core packages.

00:01:00.030 --> 00:01:02.430
For more details on
these and other updates,

00:01:02.430 --> 00:01:04.410
check out the post.

00:01:04.410 --> 00:01:07.890
Tangent is a new, free, and
open source Python library

00:01:07.890 --> 00:01:10.170
for automatic
differentiation, and

00:01:10.170 --> 00:01:14.670
its source-to-source system,
consuming a Python function F

00:01:14.670 --> 00:01:16.950
and emitting a new
Python function that

00:01:16.950 --> 00:01:20.850
computes the gradient of F.
This allows much better user

00:01:20.850 --> 00:01:22.980
visibility into
gradient computations,

00:01:22.980 --> 00:01:25.770
as well as easy
user-level editing

00:01:25.770 --> 00:01:28.261
and debugging of gradients.

00:01:28.261 --> 00:01:29.760
We're excited to
announce that we're

00:01:29.760 --> 00:01:33.060
adding Domain Name System
Security Extension support

00:01:33.060 --> 00:01:37.170
to our fully-managed
Google Cloud DNS service.

00:01:37.170 --> 00:01:39.240
Now you and your users
can take advantage

00:01:39.240 --> 00:01:41.760
of the protection
provided by DNSSEC

00:01:41.760 --> 00:01:44.520
without having to maintain
it once it's set up.

00:01:44.520 --> 00:01:47.020
Screenshots are on the post.

00:01:47.020 --> 00:01:48.780
Google Cloud Dataprep,
which has been

00:01:48.780 --> 00:01:52.080
available to the public in a
beta release for just a month,

00:01:52.080 --> 00:01:54.840
had its first public
update on Thursday.

00:01:54.840 --> 00:01:59.220
Included is a fresh UI, job
scheduling, and richer sampling

00:01:59.220 --> 00:02:00.150
options.

00:02:00.150 --> 00:02:03.360
Details for each are on the
post linked in the description

00:02:03.360 --> 00:02:04.480
below.

00:02:04.480 --> 00:02:06.340

I'm Timothy Jordan, and
I'll see you next week.

00:02:10.020 --> 00:02:10.750
Hey, everyone.

00:02:10.750 --> 00:02:13.270
Thanks for watching yet another
episode of "The Developer

00:02:13.270 --> 00:02:13.770
Show."
