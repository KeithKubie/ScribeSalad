hello my name is Fred Ryan I'm speaking

00:00:03.800 --> 00:00:03.810
hello my name is Fred Ryan I'm speaking
 

00:00:03.810 --> 00:00:06.860
hello my name is Fred Ryan I'm speaking
to you from inside my garage and Clinton

00:00:06.860 --> 00:00:06.870
to you from inside my garage and Clinton
 

00:00:06.870 --> 00:00:10.270
to you from inside my garage and Clinton
New Jersey I'm a retired police officer

00:00:10.270 --> 00:00:10.280
New Jersey I'm a retired police officer
 

00:00:10.280 --> 00:00:14.930
New Jersey I'm a retired police officer
my question is is it possible to measure

00:00:14.930 --> 00:00:14.940
my question is is it possible to measure
 

00:00:14.940 --> 00:00:20.090
my question is is it possible to measure
the trajectory of a galaxy I'm

00:00:20.090 --> 00:00:20.100
the trajectory of a galaxy I'm
 

00:00:20.100 --> 00:00:23.960
the trajectory of a galaxy I'm
interested in learning whether or not we

00:00:23.960 --> 00:00:23.970
interested in learning whether or not we
 

00:00:23.970 --> 00:00:27.410
interested in learning whether or not we
can determine if galaxies are actually

00:00:27.410 --> 00:00:27.420
can determine if galaxies are actually
 

00:00:27.420 --> 00:00:30.589
can determine if galaxies are actually
moving in an arc and I believe that if

00:00:30.589 --> 00:00:30.599
moving in an arc and I believe that if
 

00:00:30.599 --> 00:00:33.229
moving in an arc and I believe that if
they are found to be moving in an arc

00:00:33.229 --> 00:00:33.239
they are found to be moving in an arc
 

00:00:33.239 --> 00:00:36.950
they are found to be moving in an arc
then we can suspect that they're

00:00:36.950 --> 00:00:36.960
then we can suspect that they're
 

00:00:36.960 --> 00:00:41.240
then we can suspect that they're
actually in an orbit thank you well hi

00:00:41.240 --> 00:00:41.250
actually in an orbit thank you well hi
 

00:00:41.250 --> 00:00:43.280
actually in an orbit thank you well hi
Fred it's actually pretty tough to

00:00:43.280 --> 00:00:43.290
Fred it's actually pretty tough to
 

00:00:43.290 --> 00:00:45.080
Fred it's actually pretty tough to
measure whether a galaxy is moving in an

00:00:45.080 --> 00:00:45.090
measure whether a galaxy is moving in an
 

00:00:45.090 --> 00:00:47.750
measure whether a galaxy is moving in an
arc we do know how to measure whether a

00:00:47.750 --> 00:00:47.760
arc we do know how to measure whether a
 

00:00:47.760 --> 00:00:49.610
arc we do know how to measure whether a
galaxy is coming towards us or away from

00:00:49.610 --> 00:00:49.620
galaxy is coming towards us or away from
 

00:00:49.620 --> 00:00:51.380
galaxy is coming towards us or away from
us we do that with the Doppler shift of

00:00:51.380 --> 00:00:51.390
us we do that with the Doppler shift of
 

00:00:51.390 --> 00:00:55.069
us we do that with the Doppler shift of
light but it's very tough to measure

00:00:55.069 --> 00:00:55.079
light but it's very tough to measure
 

00:00:55.079 --> 00:00:56.990
light but it's very tough to measure
whether a galaxy is going across the sky

00:00:56.990 --> 00:00:57.000
whether a galaxy is going across the sky
 

00:00:57.000 --> 00:00:59.540
whether a galaxy is going across the sky
in front of us so so far we're not able

00:00:59.540 --> 00:00:59.550
in front of us so so far we're not able
 

00:00:59.550 --> 00:01:01.610
in front of us so so far we're not able
to tell if it's moving in an arc by

00:01:01.610 --> 00:01:01.620
to tell if it's moving in an arc by
 

00:01:01.620 --> 00:01:03.680
to tell if it's moving in an arc by
observations but we can certainly

00:01:03.680 --> 00:01:03.690
observations but we can certainly
 

00:01:03.690 --> 00:01:05.600
observations but we can certainly
calculate the way that galaxies move or

00:01:05.600 --> 00:01:05.610
calculate the way that galaxies move or
 

00:01:05.610 --> 00:01:07.820
calculate the way that galaxies move or
should move because when we see a cloud

00:01:07.820 --> 00:01:07.830
should move because when we see a cloud
 

00:01:07.830 --> 00:01:10.250
should move because when we see a cloud
of galaxies with several of them in a

00:01:10.250 --> 00:01:10.260
of galaxies with several of them in a
 

00:01:10.260 --> 00:01:12.050
of galaxies with several of them in a
group or maybe hundreds or thousands of

00:01:12.050 --> 00:01:12.060
group or maybe hundreds or thousands of
 

00:01:12.060 --> 00:01:13.760
group or maybe hundreds or thousands of
them in a group we see them moving

00:01:13.760 --> 00:01:13.770
them in a group we see them moving
 

00:01:13.770 --> 00:01:15.410
them in a group we see them moving
towards us and away from is in a way

00:01:15.410 --> 00:01:15.420
towards us and away from is in a way
 

00:01:15.420 --> 00:01:16.820
towards us and away from is in a way
that tells us they must be orbiting

00:01:16.820 --> 00:01:16.830
that tells us they must be orbiting
 

00:01:16.830 --> 00:01:19.550
that tells us they must be orbiting
around each other so we calculate that

00:01:19.550 --> 00:01:19.560
around each other so we calculate that
 

00:01:19.560 --> 00:01:21.170
around each other so we calculate that
they must be moving in arcs even though

00:01:21.170 --> 00:01:21.180
they must be moving in arcs even though
 

00:01:21.180 --> 00:01:23.690
they must be moving in arcs even though
that we can't see the arcs themselves so

00:01:23.690 --> 00:01:23.700
that we can't see the arcs themselves so
 

00:01:23.700 --> 00:01:25.010
that we can't see the arcs themselves so
we're pretty sure that the answer to

00:01:25.010 --> 00:01:25.020
we're pretty sure that the answer to
 

00:01:25.020 --> 00:01:27.740
we're pretty sure that the answer to
your question is yes
