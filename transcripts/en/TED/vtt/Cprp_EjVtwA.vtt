00:00:12.813 --> 00:00:15.579
On a warm August morning in Harare,

00:00:16.336 --> 00:00:17.500
Farai,

00:00:18.550 --> 00:00:21.120
a 24-year-old mother of two,

00:00:21.144 --> 00:00:23.864
walks towards a park bench.

00:00:24.765 --> 00:00:28.079
She looks miserable and dejected.

00:00:28.581 --> 00:00:33.904
Now, on the park bench
sits an 82-year-old woman,

00:00:33.928 --> 00:00:37.478
better known to the community
as Grandmother Jack.

00:00:39.392 --> 00:00:45.912
Farai hands Grandmother Jack
an envelope from the clinic nurse.

00:00:47.373 --> 00:00:50.385
Grandmother Jack invites Farai to sit down

00:00:50.409 --> 00:00:53.793
as she opens the envelope and reads.

00:00:53.817 --> 00:00:57.664
There's silence for three minutes
or so as she reads.

00:00:58.899 --> 00:01:02.965
And after a long pause,
Grandmother Jack takes a deep breath,

00:01:02.989 --> 00:01:05.502
looks at Farai and says,

00:01:06.640 --> 00:01:07.926
"I'm here for you.

00:01:10.463 --> 00:01:12.615
Would you like to share
your story with me?"

00:01:13.530 --> 00:01:15.368
Farai begins,

00:01:15.392 --> 00:01:17.898
her eyes swelling with tears.

00:01:19.383 --> 00:01:21.443
She says, "Grandmother Jack,

00:01:22.092 --> 00:01:23.756
I'm HIV-positive.

00:01:24.721 --> 00:01:27.587
I've been living with HIV
for the past four years.

00:01:28.019 --> 00:01:30.208
My husband left me a year ago.

00:01:30.645 --> 00:01:31.943
I have two kids

00:01:32.683 --> 00:01:34.013
under the age of five.

00:01:34.343 --> 00:01:35.538
I'm unemployed.

00:01:35.981 --> 00:01:39.543
I can hardly take care of my children."

00:01:40.211 --> 00:01:42.714
Tears are now flowing down her face.

00:01:43.252 --> 00:01:46.733
And in response,
Grandmother Jack moves closer,

00:01:47.375 --> 00:01:49.329
puts her hand on Farai,

00:01:49.353 --> 00:01:52.538
and says, "Farai, it's OK to cry.

00:01:53.800 --> 00:01:55.257
You've been through a lot.

00:01:56.453 --> 00:01:58.401
Would you like to share more with me?"

00:01:59.060 --> 00:02:00.747
And Farai continues.

00:02:02.140 --> 00:02:03.841
"In the last three weeks,

00:02:04.666 --> 00:02:08.413
I have had recurrent thoughts
of killing myself,

00:02:09.603 --> 00:02:11.608
taking my two children with me.

00:02:12.717 --> 00:02:14.343
I can't take it anymore.

00:02:15.154 --> 00:02:19.222
The clinic nurse sent me to see you."

00:02:20.304 --> 00:02:24.528
There's an exchange between the two,
which lasts about 30 minutes.

00:02:25.128 --> 00:02:27.685
And finally, Grandmother Jack says,

00:02:28.569 --> 00:02:29.727
"Farai,

00:02:30.533 --> 00:02:36.028
it seems to me that you have
all the symptoms of kufungisisa."

00:02:37.778 --> 00:02:42.544
The word "kufungisisa"
opens up a floodgate of tears.

00:02:44.497 --> 00:02:48.753
So, kufungisisa is the local
equivalent of depression

00:02:48.777 --> 00:02:49.927
in my country.

00:02:50.776 --> 00:02:52.363
It literally means

00:02:52.837 --> 00:02:54.579
"thinking too much."

00:02:56.035 --> 00:02:59.444
The World Health Organization estimates

00:02:59.468 --> 00:03:05.577
that more than 300 million people
globally, today, suffer from depression,

00:03:05.601 --> 00:03:08.473
or what in my country
we call kufungisisa.

00:03:08.966 --> 00:03:12.012
And the World Health
Organization also tells us

00:03:12.036 --> 00:03:15.153
that every 40 seconds,

00:03:15.177 --> 00:03:19.227
someone somewhere in the world
commits suicide

00:03:19.251 --> 00:03:20.522
because they are unhappy,

00:03:21.055 --> 00:03:24.612
largely due to depression or kufungisisa.

00:03:24.636 --> 00:03:28.216
And most of these deaths are occurring
in low- and middle-income countries.

00:03:29.395 --> 00:03:30.621
In fact,

00:03:30.645 --> 00:03:33.548
the World Health Organization
goes as far as to say

00:03:34.425 --> 00:03:38.333
that when you look at the age group
between 15 to 29,

00:03:38.357 --> 00:03:42.805
a leading cause of death
now is actually suicide.

00:03:43.849 --> 00:03:47.505
But there are wider events
that lead to depression

00:03:47.529 --> 00:03:49.324
and in some cases, suicide,

00:03:49.348 --> 00:03:50.634
such as abuse,

00:03:51.151 --> 00:03:53.194
conflict, violence,

00:03:53.865 --> 00:03:56.208
isolation, loneliness --

00:03:56.232 --> 00:03:57.583
the list is endless.

00:03:59.594 --> 00:04:01.910
But one thing that we do know

00:04:01.934 --> 00:04:05.883
is that depression can be treated
and suicides averted.

00:04:06.401 --> 00:04:07.557
But the problem is

00:04:07.581 --> 00:04:11.031
we just don't have enough psychiatrists
or psychologists in the world

00:04:11.055 --> 00:04:12.413
to do the job.

00:04:12.437 --> 00:04:15.461
In most low- and middle-income
countries, for instance,

00:04:15.485 --> 00:04:18.265
the ratio of psychiatrists
to the population

00:04:18.289 --> 00:04:22.449
is something like one for every
one and a half million people,

00:04:22.473 --> 00:04:26.050
which literally means
that 90 percent of the people

00:04:26.074 --> 00:04:28.094
needing mental health services

00:04:28.118 --> 00:04:29.606
will not get it.

00:04:30.039 --> 00:04:31.229
In my country,

00:04:31.918 --> 00:04:34.547
there are 12 psychiatrists,

00:04:34.571 --> 00:04:35.815
and I'm one of them,

00:04:36.414 --> 00:04:40.328
for a population
of approximately 14 million.

00:04:40.352 --> 00:04:42.342
Now, let me just put that into context.

00:04:43.107 --> 00:04:45.759
One evening while I was at home,

00:04:46.319 --> 00:04:48.967
I get a call from the ER,

00:04:48.991 --> 00:04:50.514
or the emergency room,

00:04:51.308 --> 00:04:54.327
from a city which is some
200 kilometers away

00:04:54.908 --> 00:04:56.173
from where I live.

00:04:56.197 --> 00:04:57.845
And the ER doctor says,

00:04:57.869 --> 00:04:59.058
"One of your patients,

00:04:59.082 --> 00:05:00.956
someone you treated four months ago,

00:05:01.440 --> 00:05:03.172
has just taken an overdose,

00:05:03.196 --> 00:05:05.245
and they are in the ER department.

00:05:05.673 --> 00:05:07.809
Hemodynamically, they seem to be OK,

00:05:07.833 --> 00:05:11.595
but they will need
neuropsychiatric evaluation."

00:05:11.619 --> 00:05:14.944
Now, I obviously can't get into my car
in the middle of the night

00:05:14.968 --> 00:05:16.689
and drive 200 kilometers.

00:05:16.713 --> 00:05:18.959
So as best as we could,

00:05:18.983 --> 00:05:21.395
over the phone with the ER doctor,

00:05:21.419 --> 00:05:23.681
we come up with an assessment.

00:05:24.148 --> 00:05:28.662
We ensure that suicidal
observations are in place.

00:05:29.162 --> 00:05:32.410
We ensure that we start reviewing
the antidepressants

00:05:32.434 --> 00:05:34.698
that this patient has been taking,

00:05:34.722 --> 00:05:36.534
and we finally conclude

00:05:37.360 --> 00:05:40.757
that as soon as Erica --
that was her name, 26-year-old --

00:05:40.781 --> 00:05:44.694
as soon as Erica is ready
to be released from the ER,

00:05:44.718 --> 00:05:47.328
she should come
directly to me with her mother,

00:05:47.352 --> 00:05:49.303
and I will evaluate

00:05:49.327 --> 00:05:51.118
and establish what can be done.

00:05:51.142 --> 00:05:53.884
And we assumed that that would
take about a week.

00:05:54.994 --> 00:05:56.404
A week passes.

00:05:56.428 --> 00:05:57.578
Three weeks pass.

00:05:57.884 --> 00:05:59.083
No Erica.

00:05:59.558 --> 00:06:01.921
And one day I get a call
from Erica's mother,

00:06:02.488 --> 00:06:03.704
and she says,

00:06:04.853 --> 00:06:07.319
"Erica committed suicide three days ago.

00:06:07.894 --> 00:06:11.760
She hanged herself from the mango tree

00:06:12.645 --> 00:06:14.103
in the family garden."

00:06:16.417 --> 00:06:19.114
Now, almost like a knee-jerk reaction,

00:06:19.614 --> 00:06:21.887
I couldn't help but ask,

00:06:21.911 --> 00:06:25.019
"But why didn't you come
to Harare, where I live?

00:06:25.043 --> 00:06:28.212
We had agreed that as soon
as you're released from the ER,

00:06:28.236 --> 00:06:29.505
you will come to me."

00:06:30.290 --> 00:06:32.488
Her response was brief.

00:06:34.056 --> 00:06:37.628
"We didn't have the 15 dollars bus fare

00:06:37.652 --> 00:06:38.918
to come to Harare."

00:06:40.412 --> 00:06:44.204
Now, suicide is not an unusual event

00:06:44.228 --> 00:06:46.145
in the world of mental health.

00:06:47.101 --> 00:06:49.724
But there was something
about Erica's death

00:06:49.748 --> 00:06:52.894
that struck me at the core
of my very being.

00:06:54.367 --> 00:06:57.182
That statement from Erica's mother:

00:06:57.766 --> 00:07:02.198
"We didn't have 15 dollars bus fare
to come to you,"

00:07:03.103 --> 00:07:04.768
made me realize

00:07:05.784 --> 00:07:07.925
that it just wasn't going to work,

00:07:07.949 --> 00:07:10.457
me expecting people to come to me.

00:07:10.813 --> 00:07:14.546
And I got into this state
of soul-searching,

00:07:14.570 --> 00:07:18.175
trying to really discover my role

00:07:18.199 --> 00:07:21.228
as a psychiatrist in Africa.

00:07:21.252 --> 00:07:25.799
And after considerable consultation
and soul-searching,

00:07:25.823 --> 00:07:28.927
talking to colleagues, friends and family,

00:07:28.951 --> 00:07:31.082
it suddenly dawned on me

00:07:31.106 --> 00:07:36.243
that actually, one the most reliable
resources we have in Africa

00:07:36.892 --> 00:07:38.177
are grandmothers.

00:07:39.707 --> 00:07:41.273
Yes, grandmothers.

00:07:41.661 --> 00:07:42.904
And I thought,

00:07:43.753 --> 00:07:46.147
grandmothers are in every community.

00:07:46.171 --> 00:07:47.764
There are hundreds of them.

00:07:48.183 --> 00:07:49.349
And --

00:07:49.373 --> 00:07:50.583
(Laughter)

00:07:50.607 --> 00:07:55.967
And they don't leave their communities
in search of greener pastures.

00:07:55.991 --> 00:07:57.189
(Laughter)

00:07:57.495 --> 00:07:59.015
See, the only time they leave

00:07:59.039 --> 00:08:01.608
is when they go to a greener
pasture called heaven.

00:08:01.632 --> 00:08:02.756
(Laughter)

00:08:02.780 --> 00:08:05.743
So I thought, how about
training grandmothers

00:08:06.740 --> 00:08:09.680
in evidence-based talk therapy,

00:08:09.704 --> 00:08:12.806
which they can deliver on a bench?

00:08:13.283 --> 00:08:16.180
Empower them with the skills to listen,

00:08:16.966 --> 00:08:18.278
to show empathy,

00:08:19.154 --> 00:08:22.514
all of that rooted
in cognitive behavioral therapy;

00:08:22.538 --> 00:08:27.020
empower them with the skills
to provide behavior activation,

00:08:27.044 --> 00:08:28.876
activity scheduling;

00:08:28.900 --> 00:08:33.473
and support them using digital technology.

00:08:33.497 --> 00:08:35.590
You know, mobile phone technology.

00:08:35.614 --> 00:08:38.246
Pretty much everyone in Africa
has a mobile phone today.

00:08:38.872 --> 00:08:40.637
So in 2006,

00:08:40.661 --> 00:08:42.841
I started my first group

00:08:44.016 --> 00:08:45.300
of grandmothers.

00:08:45.324 --> 00:08:48.846
(Applause)

00:08:49.186 --> 00:08:50.336
Thank you.

00:08:50.360 --> 00:08:52.639
(Applause)

00:08:53.229 --> 00:08:56.564
Today, there are hundreds of grandmothers

00:08:56.588 --> 00:08:59.384
who are working
in more than 70 communities.

00:09:00.844 --> 00:09:02.672
And in the last year alone,

00:09:03.371 --> 00:09:08.296
more than 30,000 people received treatment

00:09:08.320 --> 00:09:09.837
on the Friendship Bench

00:09:09.861 --> 00:09:13.228
from a grandmother
in a community in Zimbabwe.

00:09:13.745 --> 00:09:16.705
(Applause)

00:09:21.305 --> 00:09:26.275
And recently, we published this work
that is done by these grandmothers

00:09:26.299 --> 00:09:29.361
in the Journal of the American
Medical Association.

00:09:29.385 --> 00:09:30.535
And --

00:09:30.559 --> 00:09:32.217
(Applause)

00:09:32.241 --> 00:09:38.918
And our results show
that six months after receiving treatment

00:09:38.942 --> 00:09:40.169
from a grandmother,

00:09:40.685 --> 00:09:42.423
people were still symptom-free:

00:09:42.851 --> 00:09:44.061
no depression,

00:09:44.836 --> 00:09:47.238
suicidal ideation completely reduced.

00:09:47.262 --> 00:09:50.944
In fact, our results --
this was a clinical trial --

00:09:50.968 --> 00:09:52.949
in fact, this clinical trial showed

00:09:52.973 --> 00:09:56.023
that grandmothers were more effective
at treating depression

00:09:56.047 --> 00:09:57.246
than doctors and --

00:09:57.270 --> 00:09:58.808
(Laughter)

00:09:58.832 --> 00:10:02.139
(Applause)

00:10:06.466 --> 00:10:07.685
And so,

00:10:08.764 --> 00:10:12.002
we're now working towards
expanding this program.

00:10:14.794 --> 00:10:21.474
There are more than 600 million people
currently aged above 65 in the world.

00:10:21.813 --> 00:10:23.684
And by the year 2050,

00:10:23.708 --> 00:10:28.416
there will be 1.5 billion people
aged 65 and above.

00:10:29.455 --> 00:10:35.473
Imagine if we could create
a global network of grandmothers

00:10:35.497 --> 00:10:39.859
in every major city in the world,

00:10:39.883 --> 00:10:43.994
who are trained
in evidence-based talk therapy,

00:10:44.018 --> 00:10:46.578
supported through digital platforms,

00:10:46.602 --> 00:10:47.817
networked.

00:10:48.553 --> 00:10:52.946
And they will make a difference
in communities.

00:10:53.377 --> 00:10:55.602
They will reduce the treatment gap

00:10:55.626 --> 00:10:58.792
for mental, neurological
and substance-use disorders.

00:11:00.283 --> 00:11:01.563
Finally,

00:11:01.587 --> 00:11:05.115
this is a file photograph
of Grandmother Jack.

00:11:05.842 --> 00:11:11.565
So, Farai had six sessions on the bench
with Grandmother Jack.

00:11:12.089 --> 00:11:13.955
Today, Farai is employed.

00:11:14.463 --> 00:11:17.888
She has her two children at school.

00:11:18.668 --> 00:11:20.149
And as for Grandmother Jack,

00:11:20.786 --> 00:11:26.937
one morning in February, we expected her
to see her 257th client on the bench.

00:11:28.453 --> 00:11:29.828
She didn't show up.

00:11:31.076 --> 00:11:34.001
She had gone to a greener
pasture called heaven.

00:11:34.460 --> 00:11:37.717
But I believe that Grandmother Jack,

00:11:37.741 --> 00:11:38.970
from up there,

00:11:39.719 --> 00:11:42.185
she's cheering on
all the other grandmothers --

00:11:42.209 --> 00:11:46.802
the increasing number of grandmothers
who are making a difference

00:11:46.826 --> 00:11:49.330
in the lives of thousands of people.

00:11:50.118 --> 00:11:52.627
And I'm sure she's in awe

00:11:52.651 --> 00:11:57.500
when she realizes that something
that she helped to pioneer

00:11:57.524 --> 00:12:00.128
is now spreading to other countries,

00:12:00.152 --> 00:12:01.374
like Malawi,

00:12:01.398 --> 00:12:02.866
the island of Zanzibar

00:12:02.890 --> 00:12:06.501
and coming closer to home
here in the Unites States

00:12:06.525 --> 00:12:07.982
in the city of New York.

00:12:09.039 --> 00:12:11.379
May her soul rest in peace.

00:12:12.508 --> 00:12:13.663
Thank you.

00:12:13.687 --> 00:12:16.480
(Applause)

00:12:16.504 --> 00:12:18.489
(Cheering)

00:12:18.513 --> 00:12:20.399
(Applause)
