00:00:00.680 --> 00:00:04.630
&gt;&gt; From the Library of
Congress in Washington, D. C.

00:00:21.020 --> 00:00:22.530
&gt;&gt; Elizabeth Peterson:
Good morning, everyone.

00:00:22.530 --> 00:00:23.830
&gt;&gt; Good morning.

00:00:23.830 --> 00:00:25.430
&gt;&gt; Elizabeth Peterson: It's such
a beautiful day and you all are

00:00:25.430 --> 00:00:28.880
such a beautiful sight to look at.

00:00:28.880 --> 00:00:31.130
Welcome to the Library of congress.

00:00:31.130 --> 00:00:35.320
I'm Betsy Peterson, the director of
the American Folk Life Center here.

00:00:35.320 --> 00:00:38.560
And I'm not going to talk
too long because the staff

00:00:38.560 --> 00:00:42.430
of the center is going to talk
about our collections and work

00:00:42.430 --> 00:00:44.620
that we do in greater detail.

00:00:44.620 --> 00:00:50.100
But the leadership of NABS
approached us last spring to talk

00:00:50.100 --> 00:00:54.360
about what we could do and
how we could work together

00:00:54.360 --> 00:00:55.940
for your conference.

00:00:55.940 --> 00:00:57.980
And so we're really excited.

00:00:57.980 --> 00:01:02.310
We've been meeting with Dilan
Pritchard for several months

00:01:02.310 --> 00:01:03.880
and talking with him on the phone.

00:01:03.880 --> 00:01:07.460
So I hope we've got a good
program here for you today.

00:01:07.460 --> 00:01:11.480 position:56%
But I think given the title or theme
of the conference in the tradition,

00:01:11.480 --> 00:01:13.980
I think you've come
to the right place.

00:01:13.980 --> 00:01:15.280
I would certainly hope so.

00:01:15.280 --> 00:01:18.430
And I think we have
a lot of materials,

00:01:18.430 --> 00:01:25.370
a lot of primary resources that can
inform and connect with the work

00:01:25.370 --> 00:01:27.680
that you do, with the
stories that you tell.

00:01:27.680 --> 00:01:30.560
And actually I think
Zora Neale Hurston has

00:01:30.560 --> 00:01:34.330
about the best definition
of folklore ever.

00:01:34.330 --> 00:01:38.120
Which is folklore is the boiled
down juice of human living.

00:01:38.120 --> 00:01:41.630
And I think that kind
of about sums it up.

00:01:41.630 --> 00:01:45.690
So we do have that
boiled down juice here.

00:01:45.690 --> 00:01:48.810
And please come back
and come back often.

00:01:48.810 --> 00:01:53.840
Before I turn it over to the staff,
I just wanted to say one word,

00:01:53.840 --> 00:02:01.100
just a note of remembrance about
a colleague, friend, mentor,

00:02:01.100 --> 00:02:04.630
Gladys Marie Fry, who I
know many of you knew.

00:02:04.630 --> 00:02:07.800
She was a great friend to folklore.

00:02:07.800 --> 00:02:11.410
And a great mentor to
many folkoreists as well.

00:02:11.410 --> 00:02:16.080
She was a professor at the
University of Maryland,

00:02:16.080 --> 00:02:21.070 position:56%
has written two fabulous books,
Night Riders and Black Folk History,

00:02:21.070 --> 00:02:26.420
and Stitch from the Soul: Slave
Quilts from the Antebellum South.

00:02:26.420 --> 00:02:30.040
And we're very sad to
hear of her passing.

00:02:30.040 --> 00:02:34.910
We know you are too, but we know
her spirit is with us here today.

00:02:34.910 --> 00:02:36.670
And I think throughout
your gathering.

00:02:36.670 --> 00:02:42.360
So with that said, I'm going to
turn this over to Todd Harvey,

00:02:42.360 --> 00:02:46.120
the curator, one of the curators,
reference librarians here

00:02:46.120 --> 00:02:47.780
at the American Folk Life Center.

00:02:47.780 --> 00:02:49.880
And actually two words.

00:02:49.880 --> 00:02:53.030
There are cups, water in the back.

00:02:53.030 --> 00:02:55.090
Please get some water
if you need some.

00:02:55.090 --> 00:02:58.720
I know some of you have found
the restrooms, but if you need

00:02:58.720 --> 00:03:03.070
to find the restrooms,
talk to some of our staff.

00:03:03.070 --> 00:03:04.950
And we'll get you all set up.

00:03:04.950 --> 00:03:08.650
And hi there.

00:03:08.650 --> 00:03:11.070
Okay. Todd Harvey.

00:03:11.070 --> 00:03:15.060
[ Applause ]

00:03:15.060 --> 00:03:16.930
&gt;&gt; Todd Harvey: Good
morning, good morning.

00:03:16.930 --> 00:03:20.770
I take the podium in gratitude,
and I think that you know why.

00:03:20.770 --> 00:03:24.690
It's because we work
in the same field

00:03:24.690 --> 00:03:30.380
and that is preserving tradition
and continuing tradition.

00:03:30.380 --> 00:03:35.120
And I do it from my place, which
is to take care of the stuff.

00:03:35.120 --> 00:03:37.970
And you do it out there
in the world.

00:03:37.970 --> 00:03:41.190
And we're all part
of the same process.

00:03:41.190 --> 00:03:50.290 position:56%
I have a few words that I think will
help us focus on the talks today.

00:03:50.290 --> 00:03:57.050
And I get to talk about
the Library of Congress

00:03:57.050 --> 00:04:03.200
which is the oldest federal
institution, cultural institution.

00:04:03.200 --> 00:04:05.800
The world's preeminent
reservoir of knowledge,

00:04:05.800 --> 00:04:08.740
providing unparalleled
integrated resources

00:04:08.740 --> 00:04:11.530 position:56%
to Congress and the American people.

00:04:11.530 --> 00:04:13.510
That's the big bold:
the American people.

00:04:13.510 --> 00:04:18.390
Founded in 1800, the library seeks
to further human understanding,

00:04:18.390 --> 00:04:21.680
wisdom, by providing
access to knowledge

00:04:21.680 --> 00:04:24.910 position:56%
through its magnificent collections.

00:04:24.910 --> 00:04:27.620
So we are the largest
library in the world,

00:04:27.620 --> 00:04:29.310
which means we have
the largest collection

00:04:29.310 --> 00:04:32.890
of storytelling in
the world by default.

00:04:32.890 --> 00:04:36.850
And most of those are here at
the American Folk Life Center.

00:04:36.850 --> 00:04:40.850 position:56%
So let me tell you, the American
Folk Life Center was created in 1976

00:04:40.850 --> 00:04:45.180 position:56%
by an act of Congress, through
programs of research, documentation,

00:04:45.180 --> 00:04:49.980 position:56%
archival preservation, reference
service, live performance, exhibits,

00:04:49.980 --> 00:04:51.650
publications and training.

00:04:51.650 --> 00:04:55.510
The American Folk Life Center
archive, established by the Library

00:04:55.510 --> 00:04:58.700
of Congress Music Division in 1928,

00:04:58.700 --> 00:05:02.880
is now one of the world's largest
archives of ethnographic materials

00:05:02.880 --> 00:05:05.900
from the United States
and around the world.

00:05:05.900 --> 00:05:09.970
Most of our materials and
our programs and our services

00:05:09.970 --> 00:05:15.530
to you are found on our website,
and it's a great thing to explore.

00:05:15.530 --> 00:05:19.180
You can waste hours and
hours of time looking at it.

00:05:19.180 --> 00:05:24.640
I curate the Lomax Collections here
at the American Folk Life Center.

00:05:24.640 --> 00:05:29.920
And they are some of the
earliest documentation.

00:05:29.920 --> 00:05:32.780
The Lomax's ran our
archive in the 1930's.

00:05:32.780 --> 00:05:36.070
And so what I thought I would
do, just to start things off,

00:05:36.070 --> 00:05:41.580
is to play a couple of
examples of Lomax materials.

00:05:41.580 --> 00:05:46.440
This isn't strictly storytelling,
but it's personal narrative.

00:05:46.440 --> 00:05:48.770
It's spoken word materials.

00:05:48.770 --> 00:05:52.510
And I think it will
give you some insight

00:05:52.510 --> 00:05:55.400
into what we have in
our collections.

00:05:55.400 --> 00:06:00.750
And so the Lomax's,
here's Mr. Lomax,

00:06:00.750 --> 00:06:03.400 position:56%
John Lomax with an unidentified man.

00:06:03.400 --> 00:06:06.160
Maybe someone will know who he is.

00:06:06.160 --> 00:06:09.040
Probably somewhere in Georgia.

00:06:09.040 --> 00:06:15.390
Here's the younger
Lomax, with Sonny Terry

00:06:15.390 --> 00:06:19.350
and Brownie McGhee, these guys.

00:06:19.350 --> 00:06:24.490
Recording girls singing
in San Antonio 1934.

00:06:24.490 --> 00:06:27.860
Alan Lomax in action in the 1980's,

00:06:27.860 --> 00:06:31.980 position:56%
explaining to the world why
cultural equity is the way we should

00:06:31.980 --> 00:06:33.800
all live.

00:06:33.800 --> 00:06:35.510
So I want to play you an example.

00:06:35.510 --> 00:06:39.800
This is [inaudible] since 1939.

00:06:39.800 --> 00:06:45.290
But the dust jacket you can see is
side A number two, The Cat's Story.

00:06:45.290 --> 00:06:46.590
[ Inaudible ]

00:06:46.590 --> 00:06:52.130
So he places himself in a
traditional tale, right?

00:06:52.130 --> 00:07:05.520
It reminds me of some of the jack
tales, the kind of magical cat

00:07:05.520 --> 00:07:10.180
who appears and disappears
in the haunted house.

00:07:10.180 --> 00:07:20.600 position:56%
And you know, it's a motif that you
find all over American storytelling.

00:07:20.600 --> 00:07:27.890
But in this case it's from
Texas and there he is.

00:07:27.890 --> 00:07:30.850
I guess he was a mule driver.

00:07:30.850 --> 00:07:35.380
So the next performer
I have for you,

00:07:35.380 --> 00:07:40.970
Alan Lomax called her the
greatest voice in American song,

00:07:40.970 --> 00:07:50.860 position:56%
Vera Hall from northwestern Alabama,
from Livingstone area Alabama.

00:07:50.860 --> 00:07:59.580
And he recorded her in
1948 for about 15 hours.

00:07:59.580 --> 00:08:00.880
He did oral history with her.

00:08:00.880 --> 00:08:09.420
And it was the only time I
believe she left Alabama.

00:08:09.420 --> 00:08:11.900
He brought her up to New York
to make these recordings.

00:08:11.900 --> 00:08:20.930
And the recorded her first
in 1937 and last in 1959.

00:08:20.930 --> 00:08:27.600
So at the American Folk Life
Center archive we have a lot

00:08:27.600 --> 00:08:30.750
of Vera Hall recordings.

00:08:30.750 --> 00:08:35.510
And this is one of her
best, The Wild Ox Moan.

00:08:35.510 --> 00:08:36.810
[ Singing ]

00:08:36.810 --> 00:08:38.110

00:08:38.110 --> 00:08:39.410
[ Inaudible ]

00:08:39.410 --> 00:08:40.710
Of course the library has
Bessy Smith recordings.

00:08:40.710 --> 00:08:42.010
[ Laughter ]

00:08:42.010 --> 00:08:44.550
Not today, but we can certainly
help you when you come back.

00:08:44.550 --> 00:08:48.410 position:56%
I know Bessy Smith was quite famous.

00:08:48.410 --> 00:08:54.750
I would listen to Vera Hall
alongside with her I think.

00:08:54.750 --> 00:08:56.810
So I have one more.

00:08:56.810 --> 00:09:01.430
I love that, because
it's improvised, right?

00:09:01.430 --> 00:09:06.270
And she's talking about what's
happening today and it feels

00:09:06.270 --> 00:09:10.280
like it could go on as
long as it needed to go on.

00:09:10.280 --> 00:09:12.030
And do you have a question?

00:09:12.030 --> 00:09:18.400
&gt;&gt; Yes. You know what, I
understand also that --

00:09:18.400 --> 00:09:19.700
[ Inaudible ]

00:09:19.700 --> 00:09:21.000
[ Laughter ]

00:09:21.000 --> 00:09:22.300
&gt;&gt; Todd Harvey: Do I know?

00:09:22.300 --> 00:09:25.280
I was listening but I can't
tell you what the words were.

00:09:25.280 --> 00:09:34.410
It is online, for what it's worth.

00:09:34.410 --> 00:09:40.600
Let's listen to one more.

00:09:40.600 --> 00:09:48.850
This is Mohave Plantation,
Moon Lake.

00:09:48.850 --> 00:10:01.420
It's in one of those Islands in
the Mississippi in Coahoma County.

00:10:01.420 --> 00:10:10.090
And this is a nighttime
service that they recorded

00:10:10.090 --> 00:10:12.090
in a little country church.

00:10:12.090 --> 00:10:16.990
And this is near the end of it,

00:10:16.990 --> 00:10:26.220
so it's hard to imagine this
has been going on for an hour.

00:10:26.220 --> 00:10:35.570
And what I love about this is
it has multilayered events going

00:10:35.570 --> 00:10:42.600
on at the same time, right?

00:10:42.600 --> 00:10:47.790
And so there is preaching, there is
singing and there is some speaking.

00:10:47.790 --> 00:10:56.190
So I just have a little bit of it
to play for you and you're going

00:10:56.190 --> 00:11:08.330
to have to come back and
listen to the whole thing.

00:11:08.330 --> 00:11:09.630

[ Applause ]

00:11:13.530 --> 00:11:18.680
All right, so I can imagine
there might be a few questions.

00:11:18.680 --> 00:11:26.690
But I want to -- Thea says I
can take a question or two.

00:11:26.690 --> 00:11:51.950
But we have to move on
soon because there are lots

00:11:51.950 --> 00:12:02.540
of people to talk to today.

00:12:02.540 --> 00:12:14.140
&gt;&gt; Elizabeth Peterson: We have
about five minutes to take a couple

00:12:14.140 --> 00:12:21.350 position:56%
of questions and I have a microphone

00:12:21.350 --> 00:12:23.980
so that it's easy for
Todd to hear you.

00:12:23.980 --> 00:12:26.970
&gt;&gt; Do your recordings
have English subtitles?

00:12:26.970 --> 00:12:28.350
&gt;&gt; Todd Harvey: No, they do not.

00:12:28.350 --> 00:12:29.990
These are archival recordings.

00:12:29.990 --> 00:12:36.030
These are discs and things
like that, the real thing.

00:12:36.030 --> 00:12:40.780
&gt;&gt; Is there a way to go online
to get some of this information?

00:12:40.780 --> 00:12:42.080
&gt;&gt; Todd Harvey: Yes.

00:12:42.080 --> 00:12:45.590
&gt;&gt; What do you do to go online?

00:12:45.590 --> 00:12:50.310
&gt;&gt; Todd Harvey: American
Folk Life Center website.

00:12:50.310 --> 00:12:52.720
&gt;&gt; That's it?

00:12:52.720 --> 00:12:59.720
Okay, thank you.

00:12:59.720 --> 00:13:06.440
&gt;&gt; Elizabeth Peterson: Also,
if you look in your packets,

00:13:06.440 --> 00:13:15.310
Dana Bell has created -- one of
our amazing staff people here

00:13:15.310 --> 00:13:21.640
at the Library of Congress --
has compiled a guide to resources

00:13:21.640 --> 00:13:24.970
that are online that
you can access remotely.

and she'll be here during the break.

00:13:33.810 --> 00:13:35.960
You can ask questions.

Dana, can you raise your hand?

00:13:38.940 --> 00:13:40.240
Here she is.

00:13:40.240 --> 00:13:42.310

00:13:43.610 --> 00:13:47.270

that I know that some

00:13:47.270 --> 00:13:51.770
of the words may be a little
bit difficult to understand,

00:13:51.770 --> 00:13:55.550
but I would hope that most of
us can appreciate the sounds

00:13:55.550 --> 00:13:59.070
and the feeling and the emotion.

00:13:59.070 --> 00:14:03.860
Understanding the period that
the people had come through.

00:14:03.860 --> 00:14:15.880
So I don't think we have
to know the exact words.

00:14:24.010 --> 00:15:29.520
We should hopefully be
able to surmise what

00:15:31.470 --> 00:15:42.880
that whole experience was about.

00:15:42.880 --> 00:15:49.780
We're from that root.

00:15:49.780 --> 00:15:52.650
&gt;&gt; Todd Harvey: Thank you.

00:15:52.650 --> 00:16:02.410
&gt;&gt; I just want to share
a quick statement.

00:16:02.410 --> 00:16:29.830
I don't know how many of you
saw me do Voices of Courage.

00:16:29.830 --> 00:16:48.560
I did it in let's see, when
we were in Little Rock, right?

00:16:48.560 --> 00:16:53.130
So when I went to study,
when I got to IB Wells,

00:16:53.130 --> 00:16:58.050
I wanted to include folk life
and I wanted to do games.

00:16:58.050 --> 00:17:06.640
And so when I came to the Library
of Congress I looked up Vera Hall.

00:17:06.640 --> 00:17:11.690
And I couldn't get the exact
region, but I got the south.

00:17:11.690 --> 00:17:15.510
And I used Vera Hall when I played
the Game Song, The Courting Song.

00:17:15.510 --> 00:17:16.810
I used Vera Hall's
Courting Song to say

00:17:16.810 --> 00:17:20.510
that at this age she would
be courting IB Wells,

00:17:20.510 --> 00:17:25.780
but she couldn't court
because her parents died.

00:17:25.780 --> 00:17:30.640
And I sing that song
with the audience,

00:17:30.640 --> 00:17:39.260
just to let you know
how to use this work.

00:17:39.260 --> 00:17:43.850
&gt;&gt; Todd Harvey: So I want
to answer more questions,

00:17:43.850 --> 00:17:49.380
but I think it's time
for us to move on.

00:17:49.380 --> 00:17:51.610
I'll be here after this.

00:17:51.610 --> 00:17:52.910
Okay, go ahead.

00:17:52.910 --> 00:17:54.210
[ Inaudible ]

00:17:54.210 --> 00:17:55.510
&gt;&gt; Elizabeth Peterson:
Hang on just one second.

00:17:55.510 --> 00:17:57.390
&gt;&gt; I don't think I need this.

00:17:57.390 --> 00:18:10.980
I look around and I see so many
people here that have these stories

00:18:10.980 --> 00:18:18.760
and everything and a lot of
us have made that transition.

00:18:18.760 --> 00:18:28.300
Is there a way that we as a group
can start recording our stories

00:18:28.300 --> 00:18:30.850
so that they can be found?

00:18:30.850 --> 00:18:35.390
You know, so that the
younger generation

00:18:35.390 --> 00:18:39.130
that comes after us can hear it?

00:18:39.130 --> 00:18:41.250
Because I heard the Vera Hall.

00:18:41.250 --> 00:18:49.160
I remember my aunt singing
those songs and things to me.

00:18:49.160 --> 00:18:55.330
I said, "Dang, I didn't
even know it."

00:18:55.330 --> 00:18:56.650
And I'm a librarian.

00:18:56.650 --> 00:18:58.500
I didn't even know.

00:18:58.500 --> 00:19:02.920
So what is the best way for someone
to have their stories recorded?

00:19:02.920 --> 00:19:05.150
Do you have any type of program

00:19:05.150 --> 00:19:08.530
where they have their stories
recorded so it can be added

00:19:08.530 --> 00:19:11.880
to the archive, to the Folk Life?

00:19:11.880 --> 00:19:13.180
&gt;&gt; Todd Harvey: There are ways.

00:19:13.180 --> 00:19:14.480
I will make you a deal.

00:19:14.480 --> 00:19:19.530
If you as a group will record your
oral histories, we will put them

00:19:19.530 --> 00:19:21.800
in the Library of Congress.

00:19:21.800 --> 00:19:23.100

00:19:23.100 --> 00:19:25.330
&gt;&gt; Elizabeth Peterson:
Also, just to let you know

00:19:25.330 --> 00:19:30.960
that our staff member Guha
Shankar will be talking more

00:19:30.960 --> 00:19:34.730
about field work later on
today in your sessions.

00:19:34.730 --> 00:19:36.030
But let's thank Todd Harvey.

00:19:36.030 --> 00:19:37.330
[ Applause ]

00:19:37.330 --> 00:19:40.030
&gt;&gt; Todd Harvey: Well, my stuff
is what you want to hear.

00:19:40.030 --> 00:19:44.560
What Megan is going to talk
about is what you have to hear.

00:19:44.560 --> 00:19:45.860
Thank you.

00:19:45.860 --> 00:19:47.160
[ Applause ]

00:19:47.160 --> 00:19:48.460
&gt;&gt; Megan Harris: Wow,
that was quite a lead-in.

00:19:48.460 --> 00:19:49.760
Thanks, Todd.

00:19:49.760 --> 00:19:51.060
Hi, everyone.

00:19:51.060 --> 00:19:52.360
Thank you so much for coming.

00:19:52.360 --> 00:19:53.660
Good morning.

00:19:53.660 --> 00:19:55.200
I don't know that I've
ever presented

00:19:55.200 --> 00:19:58.820
to as enthusiastic
an audience as this.

00:19:58.820 --> 00:20:05.750
It's really wonderful
and it puts me at ease

00:20:05.750 --> 00:20:08.880
because I am not a
performer whatsoever.

00:20:08.880 --> 00:20:12.430
So you'll have to bear
with me a little bit.

00:20:12.430 --> 00:20:15.430
Great. Todd's presentation
was actually a great lead-in

00:20:15.430 --> 00:20:20.620
to my presentation because I am
from the Veterans History Project.

00:20:20.620 --> 00:20:23.230
I am the reference specialist
at the Veterans History Project.

00:20:23.230 --> 00:20:26.820
And we're part of the American Folk
Life Center here at the Library.

00:20:26.820 --> 00:20:30.640
And it's a project that
you can take part in

00:20:30.640 --> 00:20:32.940
and donate stories of veterans.

00:20:32.940 --> 00:20:35.420
So it's a great lead-in
to the question

00:20:35.420 --> 00:20:39.270
about how can our stories
be part of the library here.

00:20:39.270 --> 00:20:40.570
All right.

00:20:40.570 --> 00:20:41.870
Let's see.

00:20:41.870 --> 00:20:46.990
Okay. So in case you don't know
about the Veterans History Project,

00:20:50.830 --> 00:20:55.620
our mission is to collect, preserve
and make accessible the stories

00:20:55.620 --> 00:20:57.850
of America's War Veterans.

00:20:57.850 --> 00:21:02.000
And we were established
by Congress in 2000.

00:21:02.000 --> 00:21:14.560
And since 2000 we're celebrating
our 15th anniversary this year.

00:21:14.560 --> 00:21:28.440
Since 2000, we've collected over
99,000 individual narratives.

00:21:28.440 --> 00:21:30.190
So quite a lot.

00:21:30.190 --> 00:21:35.740
And our emphasis is really on the
social and cultural experience.

00:21:35.740 --> 00:21:43.500
Not so much the military
history experience.

00:21:43.500 --> 00:21:48.570
We're not so much about
charting how battles were won

00:21:48.570 --> 00:21:56.870
and how different regiments
took part in a glorious victory.

00:21:56.870 --> 00:22:02.810
It's really more about what
the experience of being

00:22:02.810 --> 00:22:09.020
in the military was all about, how
it felt, how basic training felt.

00:22:09.020 --> 00:22:11.760
How it felt to leave your family.

00:22:11.760 --> 00:22:16.140
Those sorts of experiential
feelings.

00:22:16.140 --> 00:22:23.330 position:56%
And we do this by asking the general
public, so folks such as yourself,

00:22:23.330 --> 00:22:25.990
to interview the veteran
in your life

00:22:25.990 --> 00:22:31.530
and then donate the oral history
to us here at the library.

00:22:31.530 --> 00:22:37.170 position:56%
We archive it and make it accessible
to researchers who are working

00:22:37.170 --> 00:22:44.090
on Ph. D dissertations, who
are working on documentaries,

00:22:44.090 --> 00:22:52.890 position:56%
who might just be wanting to know
more about their own family history.

00:22:52.890 --> 00:23:00.770
We make these stories accessible
both in the reading room here

00:23:00.770 --> 00:23:03.920
at the library as well as online.

00:23:03.920 --> 00:23:09.470
So in terms of our
African American holdings,

00:23:09.470 --> 00:23:16.590
stories of African American
veterans, these are some

00:23:16.590 --> 00:23:24.250
of the photos that we have
that have been donated to us.

00:23:24.250 --> 00:23:28.590
All of these folks here have
taken part in our project.

00:23:28.590 --> 00:23:31.560
We have over 3,000
stories of veterans

00:23:31.560 --> 00:23:37.360
who have self-identified
as African American.

00:23:37.360 --> 00:23:46.210
And you can see that out of the
99,000, 3,000 is only a small part.

00:23:46.210 --> 00:23:52.390
And it really has to do with
the fact that we are dependent

00:23:52.390 --> 00:23:58.850
on the general public
not only for the stories,

00:23:58.850 --> 00:24:02.870
but for the information
about the veterans.

00:24:02.870 --> 00:24:07.140
So we can only count a story

00:24:07.140 --> 00:24:15.500
if someone has self-identified
as African American.

00:24:15.500 --> 00:24:27.000
This is what we call metadata and
it's really important that we know

00:24:27.000 --> 00:24:31.400
as much as we can about
the veteran and their story

00:24:31.400 --> 00:24:32.890
when they're donated to us.

00:24:32.890 --> 00:24:35.050
So it's a small fraction.

00:24:35.050 --> 00:24:39.260
There are more veterans than
this that are in our collection.

00:24:39.260 --> 00:24:41.940
But that's the number
that we can go with.

00:24:41.940 --> 00:24:46.650
About 500 of these are fully
digitized and available online.

00:24:46.650 --> 00:24:51.570
And they span every branch,
every conflict from World War II

00:24:51.570 --> 00:24:56.610
to the present, including recent
conflicts in Iraq and Afghanistan.

00:24:56.610 --> 00:24:57.910
And every rank.

00:24:57.910 --> 00:25:01.110
So we have some of the more lauded
stories from Tuskegee airmen

00:25:01.110 --> 00:25:02.830
and Montfort Point Marines.

00:25:02.830 --> 00:25:06.310
And then veterans who maybe
didn't ever leave the state,

00:25:06.310 --> 00:25:10.460 position:56%
who just served stateside or who
served in more administrative roles.

00:25:10.460 --> 00:25:13.120
We are again interested
in all experiences,

00:25:13.120 --> 00:25:16.170
and not just combat roles
or storming the beach

00:25:16.170 --> 00:25:18.740
or in the trenches,
but all of the roles.

00:25:18.740 --> 00:25:22.690 position:56%
So one of the stories that I wanted
to show you today, I decided to look

00:25:22.690 --> 00:25:25.120
at two different collections
just to give you a taste

00:25:25.120 --> 00:25:27.560
of what our collections
are all about.

00:25:27.560 --> 00:25:30.340
The first veteran is
James Edward Blakely.

00:25:30.340 --> 00:25:35.580
He enlisted in the Navy in 1939 and
he served as a cook aboard a couple

00:25:35.580 --> 00:25:39.990
of different ships in
the Pacific Theatre.

00:25:39.990 --> 00:25:41.290
[ Inaudible ]

00:25:41.290 --> 00:25:42.590
Sorry?

00:25:42.590 --> 00:25:43.890
[ Inaudible ]

00:25:43.890 --> 00:25:45.210
Yeah, just like Dorie
Miller, exactly.

00:25:45.210 --> 00:25:48.460
Yeah. And just like Dorie
Miller he was stationed

00:25:48.460 --> 00:25:51.060
at Pearl Harbor on
December 7th, 1941.

00:25:51.060 --> 00:25:52.580
So I thought this was
a good collection

00:25:52.580 --> 00:25:55.160
as we approach Pearl Harbor Day.

00:25:55.160 --> 00:25:59.170
And John, if you could
play that first audio clip.

00:25:59.170 --> 00:26:01.510
So this is part of this collection.

00:26:01.510 --> 00:26:14.350
&gt;&gt; About five or six minutes before
8:00, I was on the USS St. Louis.

00:26:14.350 --> 00:26:19.830
That's what they call
box-back cruiser.

00:26:19.830 --> 00:26:25.520 position:56%
The word came over the loudspeaker,
"All hands man your battle stations.

00:26:25.520 --> 00:26:27.910
All hands man your battle stations.

00:26:27.910 --> 00:26:30.580
This is not a drill."

00:26:30.580 --> 00:26:34.780
That was where hell on earth began.

00:26:34.780 --> 00:26:41.270
We only had probably 50, 60 men
aboard, coming back to their ship.

00:26:41.270 --> 00:26:46.580
And when I looked around,
it was a direct hit,

00:26:46.580 --> 00:26:54.190
right in the middle of the ship.

00:26:54.190 --> 00:26:59.330
In December in Hawaii,
the world is like summer,

00:26:59.330 --> 00:27:05.490
and I could see white
uniforms blown sky high.

00:27:05.490 --> 00:27:09.860
They never made it.

00:27:19.500 --> 00:27:25.880
I don't have to close
my eyes to see that.

00:27:25.880 --> 00:27:31.140
&gt;&gt; Megan Harris: So you can see

00:27:31.140 --> 00:27:35.220
that Mr. Blakely's story is maybe
different than those that we have

00:27:35.220 --> 00:27:38.710
in the Lomax Collection, or those
that Todd talked to you about.

00:27:38.710 --> 00:27:44.090
But I think you'll agree
that that account is equally

00:27:44.090 --> 00:27:45.940
as important in terms of folk life.

00:27:45.940 --> 00:27:48.850
Yeah, so that's Mr.
Blakely's collection.

00:27:48.850 --> 00:27:50.680
The next collection that I wanted

00:27:50.680 --> 00:27:53.430
to show you is actually
a video collection

00:27:53.430 --> 00:27:56.390 position:56%
from Evelyn Clarisse Martin Johnson.

00:27:56.390 --> 00:27:58.660
She was in the Women's Army Corps.

00:27:58.660 --> 00:28:03.300
She enlisted in 1941 and she
served in a postal battalion,

00:28:03.300 --> 00:28:06.870
which was actually the only all
African American female unit

00:28:06.870 --> 00:28:08.610
to serve overseas.

00:28:08.610 --> 00:28:12.040
She served in France and
England during World War II.

00:28:12.040 --> 00:28:14.980
And John, if you can play that
clip, that would be great.

00:28:14.980 --> 00:28:17.370
She talks about her
experiences are overseas.

00:28:17.370 --> 00:28:21.320
&gt;&gt; What were your emotions over
there when you did see them?

00:28:22.560 --> 00:28:29.150
&gt;&gt; Well, destruction
is heartbreaking.

00:28:29.150 --> 00:28:36.350
To see how the schools,
the churches,

00:28:36.350 --> 00:28:40.680
the entire communities were bombed.

00:28:40.680 --> 00:28:46.080 position:56%
Because all that destruction had not
yet been cleared up or cleaned up.

00:28:46.080 --> 00:28:50.190
And we saw that daily,
where we were.

00:28:50.190 --> 00:28:54.240
Because they had bombed Birmingham
before we had arrived there.

00:28:54.240 --> 00:28:58.190 position:56%
And it was the same in rural France.

00:28:58.190 --> 00:29:02.840
That was what was sort
of helping you

00:29:02.840 --> 00:29:08.250
to wish you were leaving the area
and on your way back to America.

00:29:08.250 --> 00:29:12.890
&gt;&gt; Did your military experience
influence your thinking about war

00:29:12.890 --> 00:29:15.620
or about the military in general?

00:29:16.900 --> 00:29:19.030
&gt;&gt; Well you don't forget it.

00:29:19.030 --> 00:29:21.750
There's no way to forget it.

00:29:21.750 --> 00:29:30.890
You try not to keep it on your
everyday thinking, but you're going

00:29:30.890 --> 00:29:36.020
to think about it especially
when there is

00:29:36.020 --> 00:29:42.100
so much similarity of
that going on later.

00:29:42.100 --> 00:29:47.970
Like the Vietnam and the Korean
War and all the other wars.

00:29:47.970 --> 00:29:49.870
You don't forget that.

00:29:49.870 --> 00:29:54.910 position:56%
&gt;&gt; How did people treat you when
they find out that you're a veteran?

00:29:54.910 --> 00:29:58.580
&gt;&gt; Oh, many of them are surprised.

00:29:58.580 --> 00:30:06.630
And then when I say World War
II, they say, "Where were you?"

00:30:06.630 --> 00:30:11.590
And then I tell them
and they are delighted.

00:30:11.590 --> 00:30:13.510
They appreciate the
fact that I did so.

00:30:13.510 --> 00:30:16.420
&gt;&gt; Megan Harris: All right, so
those are just two of the stories

00:30:16.420 --> 00:30:17.720
that we have in our collection.

00:30:17.720 --> 00:30:19.940
They happen to both
be from World War II.

00:30:19.940 --> 00:30:21.690
But like I said, we collect stories

00:30:21.690 --> 00:30:25.570
from all conflicts,
and even between wars.

00:30:25.570 --> 00:30:29.690
So not just limited to particular
conflicts, particular wars.

00:30:29.690 --> 00:30:34.200
But anyone who served in US uniform
can take part in our project.

00:30:34.200 --> 00:30:35.660
Let's see, all right.

00:30:35.660 --> 00:30:38.390
So just really quick, a
couple of other resources.

00:30:38.390 --> 00:30:41.360
Like I said, some of our
collections are digitized

00:30:41.360 --> 00:30:42.800
and available on our website.

00:30:42.800 --> 00:30:44.740
So you can search our website.

00:30:44.740 --> 00:30:50.010
We have an online database you
can search by race, by gender,

00:30:50.010 --> 00:30:51.960
by service location and unit.

00:30:51.960 --> 00:30:54.460
So if you have family
members or if you want

00:30:54.460 --> 00:30:57.060
to research the particular
history of a unit,

00:30:57.060 --> 00:30:59.550
you can do that with
our online database.

00:30:59.550 --> 00:31:03.000
We also have online exhibits.

00:31:03.000 --> 00:31:04.860
It's a series called
Experiencing War.

00:31:04.860 --> 00:31:09.090
And we released those quarterly
on a number of different topics

00:31:09.090 --> 00:31:13.240
and we have right now two different
online exhibits that pertain

00:31:13.240 --> 00:31:15.170
to African American veterans.

00:31:15.170 --> 00:31:18.990
So you can go to our
website to see those.

00:31:18.990 --> 00:31:21.870
And that's all I have
for you right now.

00:31:21.870 --> 00:31:24.070
But I'd be more than
happy to take a couple

00:31:24.070 --> 00:31:26.270
of questions if there are any.

00:31:26.270 --> 00:31:31.760
&gt;&gt; Detroit Public Library is
celebrating their sesquicentennial,

00:31:31.760 --> 00:31:35.230
along with the Detroit
Police Department.

00:31:35.230 --> 00:31:40.850
And I wanted to know how would I
with assistance through the Library

00:31:40.850 --> 00:31:45.270
of Congress set up a
Sesquicentennial blog

00:31:45.270 --> 00:31:47.790
where people tell their
stories and the stories

00:31:47.790 --> 00:31:51.940
of their community service
in the city of Detroit.

00:31:51.940 --> 00:31:53.240
&gt;&gt; Megan Harris: That's
a great question.

00:31:53.240 --> 00:31:57.060
And it gets towards -- the
question was about working

00:31:57.060 --> 00:32:01.660
with partner organizations such
as the Detroit Public Library

00:32:01.660 --> 00:32:05.670
to donate oral histories
to us and to the library.

00:32:05.670 --> 00:32:09.470
And we have organizations that
donate collections ranging

00:32:09.470 --> 00:32:12.910
from public libraries to
retirement communities,

00:32:12.910 --> 00:32:16.230
to schools from K-12
and universities.

00:32:16.230 --> 00:32:17.630
All sorts of organizations.

00:32:17.630 --> 00:32:21.870
And so I would definitely encourage
you to go to the public library

00:32:21.870 --> 00:32:25.800
and work with the librarians
there to start your own project.

00:32:25.800 --> 00:32:29.370
There's not anything
specific that you need to do.

00:32:29.370 --> 00:32:32.470
We can get information to you and
I can have some of my colleagues

00:32:32.470 --> 00:32:35.720
who work on the programming end
of the project work with you.

00:32:35.720 --> 00:32:39.460
But it's really, if you
have the will to start this

00:32:39.460 --> 00:32:43.440
up in your community, then
you can go ahead and do that.

00:32:43.440 --> 00:32:44.740
Yeah, yeah.

00:32:44.740 --> 00:32:46.040
Hi.

00:32:46.040 --> 00:32:50.630
&gt;&gt; So I remember a couple of years
ago a student tried to do a project

00:32:50.630 --> 00:32:53.450
with the regiments where they
wrote their stories down.

00:32:53.450 --> 00:32:57.210
And I know a lot of library
systems are trying to do that now

00:32:57.210 --> 00:32:59.840
and get the veterans to come in.

00:32:59.840 --> 00:33:02.750
Do you do a partnership
or do you have a program

00:33:02.750 --> 00:33:06.720
where they can come together in
a group and record their stories

00:33:06.720 --> 00:33:10.020
or write their stories so they
can submit it to the archives?

00:33:10.020 --> 00:33:14.260
I'm a veteran myself and I'm
one of the last of the wax.

00:33:14.260 --> 00:33:17.990
So mine was from a
reserve point of view

00:33:17.990 --> 00:33:20.530
but I think it would
be really important

00:33:20.530 --> 00:33:22.620
that all those stories get put in.

00:33:22.620 --> 00:33:25.150
So if there's a way that we

00:33:25.150 --> 00:33:29.240
as a group can organize
to get the stories in.

00:33:29.240 --> 00:33:30.540
&gt;&gt; Megan Harris: Yeah, wonderful.

00:33:30.540 --> 00:33:31.990
And yes, definitely.

00:33:31.990 --> 00:33:34.230
Even as a reservist, your
story is very important

00:33:34.230 --> 00:33:36.710
and we definitely want
it in our archive.

00:33:36.710 --> 00:33:40.310
And in terms of working
with community organizations

00:33:40.310 --> 00:33:44.870
and with students, we have, like I
said, a lot of different programs

00:33:44.870 --> 00:33:48.780
at schools, whether
it's younger students

00:33:48.780 --> 00:33:51.260
or older students and universities.

00:33:51.260 --> 00:33:54.980
Generally we need stories to be
kind of one-on-one interviews.

00:33:54.980 --> 00:33:58.290
But that doesn't preclude
having larger programs.

00:33:58.290 --> 00:34:01.350
And I can speak with
you after the program

00:34:01.350 --> 00:34:04.150
about your specific community
where you are and see

00:34:04.150 --> 00:34:06.970
if there are organizations that
are already set up doing this.

00:34:06.970 --> 00:34:08.810
That would be wonderful.

00:34:08.810 --> 00:34:12.840
Yeah. Any other questions?

00:34:12.840 --> 00:34:14.140
Okay.

00:34:14.140 --> 00:34:20.800
&gt;&gt; Elizabeth Peterson: Okay, Let's
thank Megan for her presentation.

00:34:20.800 --> 00:34:22.100
[ Applause ]

00:34:22.100 --> 00:34:24.040
And we have one more staff member,
Guha Shankar is going to come up

00:34:24.040 --> 00:34:26.050
and talk about the Civil
Rights Oral History Project

00:34:26.050 --> 00:34:27.840
and a couple of others.

00:34:27.840 --> 00:34:30.480
But we have a few late arrivals.

00:34:30.480 --> 00:34:36.650
So if you have an empty seat next
to you, could you raise your hand?

00:34:36.650 --> 00:34:39.700
So we have a seat up here.

00:34:39.700 --> 00:34:42.390
We have a couple right in here.

00:34:42.390 --> 00:34:45.710
There's one here.

00:34:45.710 --> 00:34:51.780
There's one in the front row here.

00:34:51.780 --> 00:35:03.750
And there's a seat over
here in the front row.

00:35:03.750 --> 00:35:11.070
Has everybody got a seat yet?

00:35:11.070 --> 00:35:16.840
No? Is that a little tight?

00:35:16.840 --> 00:35:25.460
Actually there are two seats here.

00:35:25.460 --> 00:35:31.970
Okay, so Guha.

00:35:31.970 --> 00:35:39.320
Actually, ace you comfortable?

00:35:39.320 --> 00:35:40.620
Are you? All right.

00:35:40.620 --> 00:35:42.880
Okay, so Guha Shankar.

00:35:42.880 --> 00:35:47.570
[ Applause ]

00:35:47.570 --> 00:35:51.990
&gt;&gt; Guha Shankar: Hi,
good morning again.

00:35:51.990 --> 00:35:53.480
Thank you all for being here.

00:35:53.480 --> 00:35:56.480
It's a privilege to be
here in front of you today.

00:35:56.480 --> 00:36:00.890
I want to thank my colleagues Todd
Harvey and Megan Harris for doing

00:36:00.890 --> 00:36:03.360
such a nice job of
setting up my presentation.

00:36:03.360 --> 00:36:06.410
I have very little to say, so
I'm just going to play some clips

00:36:06.410 --> 00:36:09.790
for you from two of our
most substantial collections

00:36:09.790 --> 00:36:12.580
that document the African American
experience here at the Library

00:36:12.580 --> 00:36:13.890
of the American Folk Life Center.

00:36:13.890 --> 00:36:17.410
If you look in your packets,
you will see the URLs

00:36:17.410 --> 00:36:19.080 position:56%
for the Civil Rights History Project

00:36:19.080 --> 00:36:22.720
and the National Visionary
Leadership Project.

00:36:22.720 --> 00:36:25.070
And those are the ones
that I'm going to talk

00:36:25.070 --> 00:36:28.370
about mostly in the
time I have here.

00:36:28.370 --> 00:36:32.910
And I look around and I think
I see some familiar faces.

00:36:32.910 --> 00:36:35.670
So I guess maybe we should
start by acknowledging that many

00:36:35.670 --> 00:36:37.450
of you have actually done
research here before.

00:36:37.450 --> 00:36:38.750
Is that correct?

00:36:38.750 --> 00:36:40.840
Those of you how have
visited our reading room,

00:36:40.840 --> 00:36:44.440
raise your hands please.

00:36:44.440 --> 00:36:45.740
Excellent.

00:36:45.740 --> 00:36:47.040
Thank you.

00:36:47.040 --> 00:36:49.560
Well, we welcome all of you, though
not at the same time, to come

00:36:49.560 --> 00:36:50.910
and visit our reading rooms.

00:36:50.910 --> 00:36:52.210
[ Laughter ]

00:36:52.210 --> 00:36:53.510
So make an appointment.

00:36:53.510 --> 00:36:54.830
Your best friend is the librarian.

00:36:54.830 --> 00:36:56.130
That's us.

00:36:56.130 --> 00:37:01.230
I also noticed that with respect
to what Megan has just said

00:37:01.230 --> 00:37:05.290
about the experiences of the
service folks here in the library,

00:37:05.290 --> 00:37:07.110
and some of you have
identified yourself,

00:37:07.110 --> 00:37:09.040
those of you who are veterans

00:37:09.040 --> 00:37:13.170
of the armed services,
please raise your hand.

00:37:13.170 --> 00:37:19.930
[ Applause ]

00:37:19.930 --> 00:37:21.230
Thank you.

00:37:21.230 --> 00:37:24.270
And then the other category
of folks I wanted to call out,

00:37:24.270 --> 00:37:27.070
give a shout out to, were
those of you who are involved

00:37:27.070 --> 00:37:29.190
in the freedom struggle
from the 1950's

00:37:29.190 --> 00:37:32.570
and '60's and on through today.

00:37:32.570 --> 00:37:37.620
[ Applause ]

00:37:37.620 --> 00:37:38.920
Thank you.

00:37:38.920 --> 00:37:42.620
All right, so with regard to
that, in your packets you will see

00:37:42.620 --> 00:37:45.500
as I said, the URL's for the
Civil Rights History project

00:37:45.500 --> 00:37:48.090
from the National Visionary
Leadership Project.

00:37:48.090 --> 00:37:53.550
These resources are available to
you online, in your own browser

00:37:53.550 --> 00:37:55.230
in the comfort of your own home.

00:37:55.230 --> 00:37:57.530
The Civil Rights History Project,
the distinction I will make is

00:37:57.530 --> 00:37:59.930
that the Civil Rights
History Project is available

00:37:59.930 --> 00:38:02.740
through the website of
the Library of Congress,

00:38:02.740 --> 00:38:04.840
as you can see down
here in the corner.

00:38:04.840 --> 00:38:07.550
And the National Visionary
Leadership Project,

00:38:07.550 --> 00:38:11.820 position:56%
although the archival materials, the
recordings, are here at the library,

00:38:11.820 --> 00:38:15.220
in point of fact the National
Visionary Leadership Project

00:38:15.220 --> 00:38:16.970
maintains its own website.

00:38:16.970 --> 00:38:19.470
And you can access stories
through their website.

00:38:19.470 --> 00:38:21.520
Have you folks visited the
National Visionary Leadership

00:38:21.520 --> 00:38:22.820
Project website?

00:38:22.820 --> 00:38:24.880
Do you know where that is?

00:38:24.880 --> 00:38:27.630
Well, you'll find out.

00:38:27.630 --> 00:38:28.930
Okay, all right.

00:38:28.930 --> 00:38:30.860
So let me begin first with the
Civil Rights History Project.

00:38:30.860 --> 00:38:34.420 position:56%
I'm the project director here at the
library side for this initiative.

00:38:34.420 --> 00:38:36.950
It's a joint effort
between the Library

00:38:36.950 --> 00:38:38.390
and the Smithsonian's
National Museum

00:38:38.390 --> 00:38:40.330
for African American
History and Culture.

00:38:40.330 --> 00:38:44.900
We operate under the
mandate of a public law

00:38:44.900 --> 00:38:48.080
that was passed in
2009 by US Congress.

00:38:48.080 --> 00:38:52.370 position:56%
Under the terms of the mandate, the
library and the NMAAHC were directed

00:38:52.370 --> 00:38:55.880
to first conduct a survey of
existing oral history collections

00:38:55.880 --> 00:38:58.560
with the relevance of the Civil
Rights Movement to obtain justice,

00:38:58.560 --> 00:39:01.100
freedom and equality
for African Americans.

00:39:01.100 --> 00:39:04.650
And then to record new interviews
with people who have participated

00:39:04.650 --> 00:39:06.880
in the struggle, beginning
about 2010.

00:39:06.880 --> 00:39:09.540
The initiative ended about 2014.

00:39:09.540 --> 00:39:15.110 position:56%
To that end, we have as you will see
here, over 100 distinct interviews

00:39:15.110 --> 00:39:18.250
with members of the struggle.

00:39:18.250 --> 00:39:21.230
Ranging from people who
were well-known and famous,

00:39:21.230 --> 00:39:23.110
like the Reverend Joseph Lowery,

00:39:23.110 --> 00:39:27.970
to others who were frontline
activists whose work is perhaps not

00:39:27.970 --> 00:39:32.700
as well known, but whose stories
are compelling nonetheless.

00:39:32.700 --> 00:39:37.060 position:56%
And we have over 100 interviews, and
some of them, just to reference back

00:39:37.060 --> 00:39:39.390
to an earlier point,
some of them are done

00:39:39.390 --> 00:39:42.110 position:56%
with multiple people in one setting.

00:39:42.110 --> 00:39:44.430
It's a difficult situation
to do something like that.

00:39:44.430 --> 00:39:46.860
I can talk about that a
little later when we talk

00:39:46.860 --> 00:39:50.220
about the technical aspects of
conducting your own documentation.

00:39:50.220 --> 00:39:52.370
So all these materials
are available.

00:39:52.370 --> 00:39:54.860
One of the nice things about the
Civil Rights History Project is

00:39:54.860 --> 00:39:59.440
that every one of these interviews,
unlike others that you might find,

00:39:59.440 --> 00:40:02.870
not just in the library site,
but also across the spectrum

00:40:02.870 --> 00:40:06.100
of oral history collections,
they're all fully transcribed.

00:40:06.100 --> 00:40:08.970
So you can actually come through
here and search for them according

00:40:08.970 --> 00:40:12.320
to locations of where
the interviews were done.

00:40:12.320 --> 00:40:17.240 position:56%
Or where they're referencing events
that were important in the struggle,

00:40:17.240 --> 00:40:20.440
like say Birmingham or
Selma and those other places

00:40:20.440 --> 00:40:23.910
like St. Augustine Florida,
which was a little less known.

00:40:23.910 --> 00:40:27.700
And we have these materials, as
I said, are available on-site.

00:40:27.700 --> 00:40:31.350
And if you look for instance at the
subject listing, it will tell you

00:40:31.350 --> 00:40:33.470
that these are all the ways
in which you can search

00:40:33.470 --> 00:40:36.050
across the collections
and aggregate.

00:40:36.050 --> 00:40:38.200
Several interviews will
come up in one place.

00:40:38.200 --> 00:40:40.710
So you can search for those
individual interviews.

00:40:40.710 --> 00:40:43.450
And you can also do what is the
librarian's best friend now.

00:40:43.450 --> 00:40:46.100
You can Google it, which
has now become a verb.

00:40:46.100 --> 00:40:47.990
And you can find some of
these materials and some

00:40:47.990 --> 00:40:51.240
of these themes embedded
within those transcripts.

00:40:51.240 --> 00:40:54.010
So I'm going to sort
of stop talking now

00:40:54.010 --> 00:40:56.720
because I think the most important
thing I can do is tell you

00:40:56.720 --> 00:41:01.970
that the words of the elders,
the words of the individuals

00:41:01.970 --> 00:41:04.130
who we interviewed are paramount.

00:41:04.130 --> 00:41:07.030
And here I'll make a distinction
between I think what Todd

00:41:07.030 --> 00:41:09.480
and Megan were also talking about.

00:41:09.480 --> 00:41:12.650
We serve at the library
the stuff that is the raw.

00:41:12.650 --> 00:41:15.460
It's up to you to cook it, right?

00:41:15.460 --> 00:41:19.100
So what we're presenting, and
the nice examples that Megan

00:41:19.100 --> 00:41:22.740
and Todd presented were extracts
from a larger corpus of materials.

00:41:22.740 --> 00:41:27.790
There's 15 hours of material
in the Vera Hall interviews.

00:41:27.790 --> 00:41:29.390
Todd pulled together something

00:41:29.390 --> 00:41:32.430
that crystalizes what
we think is important

00:41:32.430 --> 00:41:34.090
about that particular
collection that speaks

00:41:34.090 --> 00:41:36.940
to a certain aspect
of the experience.

00:41:36.940 --> 00:41:40.260
We cannot do the research
for you, as you well know.

00:41:40.260 --> 00:41:42.600
And find out what those
nuggets of information are.

00:41:42.600 --> 00:41:45.260
That's what archival
research is in a lot of cases:

00:41:45.260 --> 00:41:47.670
digging down, digging deep.

00:41:47.670 --> 00:41:50.230
Gold doesn't just wash up
on the shore in your pan.

00:41:50.230 --> 00:41:51.930
You've got to go looking for it.

00:41:51.930 --> 00:41:55.780 position:56%
And that means doing all of this
work like reading through or looking

00:41:55.780 --> 00:41:57.650
through over 200 hours of materials

00:41:57.650 --> 00:41:59.260
from the Civil Rights
History Project alone.

00:41:59.260 --> 00:42:02.080
There are over 300 interviews

00:42:02.080 --> 00:42:04.250
in the National Visionary
Leadership Project.

00:42:04.250 --> 00:42:07.540
And don't even get us started
about the Alan Lomax collection.

00:42:07.540 --> 00:42:10.060
So it's a lifetime worth of work.

00:42:10.060 --> 00:42:12.160
I certainly made it my lifetime,
because I've been here a long time.

00:42:12.160 --> 00:42:13.470
So I'm happy here.

00:42:13.470 --> 00:42:16.690
But you're all welcome to come
and participate with that as well.

00:42:16.690 --> 00:42:20.370
So without further ado I'm going
to start with the first interview.

00:42:20.370 --> 00:42:23.400
And this is with Sam
Mahone who was interviewed

00:42:23.400 --> 00:42:26.020
in Albany, Georgia in 2013.

00:42:26.020 --> 00:42:28.220
Sam Mahone was a Civil
Rights Activist

00:42:28.220 --> 00:42:30.710
with a student nonviolent
coordinating community

00:42:30.710 --> 00:42:34.740
in America's Georgia College
of Art Institute of Atlanta,

00:42:34.740 --> 00:42:37.520
working several art
museums and galleries.

00:42:37.520 --> 00:42:40.610
In this interview he discusses his
experience of racial segregation,

00:42:40.610 --> 00:42:43.370 position:56%
discrimination in America's Georgia.

00:42:43.370 --> 00:42:48.400
And the experiences which were
on the heels of the passage

00:42:48.400 --> 00:42:51.040
of the Civil Rights Act of 1964.

00:42:51.040 --> 00:42:52.390
How many of you have been

00:42:52.390 --> 00:42:54.790
to the Civil Rights
exhibit here in the library?

00:42:54.790 --> 00:43:00.980
Well, you all must
be from out of town.

00:43:00.980 --> 00:43:02.290
So if you haven't done it, go.

00:43:02.290 --> 00:43:04.950
Not now, but go after
this presentation.

00:43:04.950 --> 00:43:06.250
Go to that exhibition.

00:43:06.250 --> 00:43:10.120
It's replete with a lot of just
fascinating material, artifacts,

00:43:10.120 --> 00:43:14.790
objects, transcripts and several
oral histories, interviews,

00:43:14.790 --> 00:43:16.800
not just from our collections
but from collections

00:43:16.800 --> 00:43:19.610
across the breadth of the library.

00:43:19.610 --> 00:43:22.600
You'd find yourself really
well-suited for that.

00:43:22.600 --> 00:43:26.430
So I want to play this first
clip, which is from Sam Mahone.

00:43:26.430 --> 00:43:33.900
&gt;&gt; I finished high school and
then I joined State and began

00:43:33.900 --> 00:43:36.470
to continue working throughout
our reference, but I also worked

00:43:36.470 --> 00:43:39.270
in other counties,
surrounding counties as well.

00:43:39.270 --> 00:43:44.610
Continued doing voter registration
and continued doing a lot

00:43:44.610 --> 00:43:48.610
of public accommodation
and what have you.

00:43:48.610 --> 00:43:54.080 position:56%
I remember the night the Civil
Rights Bill was passed we decided we

00:43:54.080 --> 00:43:58.400
were going to test it
at a local restaurant.

00:43:58.400 --> 00:43:59.760
&gt;&gt; This is July '64?

00:43:59.760 --> 00:44:01.550
&gt;&gt; Exactly.

00:44:01.550 --> 00:44:06.030
Myself and John Padoe
who I believe is here,

00:44:06.030 --> 00:44:10.600
who was one of the
America's state workers.

00:44:10.600 --> 00:44:15.430
Bob Mince, Adam Wolhouse
who recently passed away.

00:44:16.520 --> 00:44:19.300
And four of the students.

00:44:19.300 --> 00:44:23.690
We went down to a place called
The Hasty House restaurant.

00:44:23.690 --> 00:44:28.010
And we sat there and
we tried to order food,

00:44:28.010 --> 00:44:31.110
but the waitress never came.

00:44:31.110 --> 00:44:38.970 position:56%
One of the guys who was with us said
he needed to go to the restroom.

00:44:38.970 --> 00:44:40.300
And the restroom was outside.

00:44:40.300 --> 00:44:43.930
You had to go outside and go
around the side of the building.

00:44:43.930 --> 00:44:46.730
Well while we were waiting, the
woman came to take our order,

00:44:46.730 --> 00:44:49.960
but about 10 minutes
passed and we realized

00:44:49.960 --> 00:44:53.380
that he hadn't come
back from the restroom.

00:44:53.380 --> 00:44:58.510
So we finally decided
to get up to leave.

00:44:58.510 --> 00:45:02.940
And as we get up to leave to go out
to the car, we were met by a group

00:45:02.940 --> 00:45:06.000
of whites who had come across
the street from a service station

00:45:06.000 --> 00:45:10.010
with tire irons and baseball bats.

00:45:10.010 --> 00:45:15.490
And so they waited until
we got into the car,

00:45:15.490 --> 00:45:17.860
which was a convertible car.

00:45:17.860 --> 00:45:21.030
And then they just rained down
on the car with baseball bats

00:45:21.030 --> 00:45:24.300
and tire irons, beating
us on top of our heads.

00:45:24.300 --> 00:45:29.970
And we finally get the car started
and we just get out of there

00:45:29.970 --> 00:45:32.760
without the guy who had
gone to the restroom.

00:45:32.760 --> 00:45:37.630
Well he shows up about two days
later and he says what happened is

00:45:37.630 --> 00:45:42.070
that when he went to the restroom
he was attacked and beaten

00:45:42.070 --> 00:45:45.090
and he just ran off
and never came back.

00:45:45.090 --> 00:45:52.080
And so that was the first evening
we decided to test the laws

00:45:52.080 --> 00:45:53.850
that Congress had passed.

00:45:53.850 --> 00:45:57.360
&gt;&gt; Guha Shankar: So that's that
moment of deep personal experience.

00:45:57.360 --> 00:46:00.070
And this is a person
operating from 50 year memory.

00:46:00.070 --> 00:46:02.820
And I think many of you might have
similar memories of experiences

00:46:02.820 --> 00:46:05.620
that just burned so deeply
into you that you recount it

00:46:05.620 --> 00:46:07.170
as though it were yesterday.

00:46:07.170 --> 00:46:09.550 position:56%
I'd be interested in finding out how

00:46:09.550 --> 00:46:13.740
and in what way storytellers craft
these kinds of personal experiences

00:46:13.740 --> 00:46:15.540
into stories for your own use

00:46:15.540 --> 00:46:19.180
and for sharing more widely
with the world outside.

00:46:19.180 --> 00:46:21.520
The second clip is
from Bill Saunders,

00:46:21.520 --> 00:46:24.290
who was born in New York, New York.

00:46:24.290 --> 00:46:26.680
Married Henrietta Jenkins
and had 10 children.

00:46:26.680 --> 00:46:29.530
Mr. Saunders attended
Southern Business College,

00:46:29.530 --> 00:46:31.740
Southern Illinois University,
vocational education,

00:46:31.740 --> 00:46:33.700
and the University of Nevada.

00:46:33.700 --> 00:46:36.620
He worked as a politician and
was also the CEO of the committee

00:46:36.620 --> 00:46:39.880
on Better Racial Assurance
Human Services Agency.

00:46:39.880 --> 00:46:42.300
He was interviewed for this
project down in South Carolina.

00:46:42.300 --> 00:46:45.700
And in this interview he recalls
serving the Army during the

00:46:45.700 --> 00:46:47.000
Korean War.

00:46:47.000 --> 00:46:49.100
And speaks of his experiences
with racism

00:46:49.100 --> 00:46:52.330
in the national army at that time.

00:46:52.330 --> 00:46:55.800
And I think those of you who have
relatives who you have spoken to,

00:46:55.800 --> 00:47:00.190
members of our service people,
and particularly of that era,

00:47:00.190 --> 00:47:03.880
will know how deeply those
experiences influence their

00:47:03.880 --> 00:47:07.680
subsequent activism in
the freedom struggle.

00:47:07.680 --> 00:47:10.010
So I want to play this
particular clip from Mr. Saunders.

00:47:10.010 --> 00:47:15.370
&gt;&gt; You confronted more racism in
Hawaii than you had encountered

00:47:15.370 --> 00:47:17.220
on Johns Island or
in Charleston even?

00:47:17.220 --> 00:47:20.390
&gt;&gt; Hawaii and the military
even in Korea.

00:47:20.390 --> 00:47:23.610
The racisms was real,
real bad in Korea.

00:47:23.610 --> 00:47:24.910
And then Hawaii.

00:47:24.910 --> 00:47:28.470
And I just realized later
on, it was right after 1851.

00:47:28.470 --> 00:47:30.590
They had just really
integrated the army.

00:47:30.590 --> 00:47:36.320
There were four blacks in our
company, one Hispanic, one Indian.

00:47:36.320 --> 00:47:40.190
And I didn't realize until
many years later that all

00:47:40.190 --> 00:47:44.330
of these people, poor white men,
who also had a lot of problems.

00:47:44.330 --> 00:47:46.880
And the only place
they could vet any

00:47:46.880 --> 00:47:51.930
of those problems was
on people like me.

00:47:51.930 --> 00:47:54.850
So they had their own problem
reasons and we had a lot of fights.

00:47:54.850 --> 00:47:58.570
&gt;&gt; Do you remember
particular instances?

00:47:58.570 --> 00:47:59.870
&gt;&gt; Physical fights.

00:47:59.870 --> 00:48:01.170
A guy will beat me,

00:48:01.170 --> 00:48:05.980
but my grandmother gave
me such a bad temper.

00:48:05.980 --> 00:48:09.270
I get real mad, I don't give up.

00:48:09.270 --> 00:48:11.490
So I don't stop when
people say to stop.

00:48:11.490 --> 00:48:14.670
So I end up being the
one getting in trouble.

00:48:14.670 --> 00:48:17.690
But they did so many
things to the blacks.

00:48:17.690 --> 00:48:21.300
We had one guy, one of my best
friends who died recently,

00:48:21.300 --> 00:48:26.740
they made him dig a 6x6x6 hole and
they decided to drop a dime in it

00:48:26.740 --> 00:48:28.510
and then make him close it up.

00:48:28.510 --> 00:48:32.570
Those were the kinds of
things we went through.

00:48:32.570 --> 00:48:35.670
And a lot of it coming back
to me more and more now.

00:48:35.670 --> 00:48:38.710
I'm having a lot of
flashbacks with that.

00:48:38.710 --> 00:48:43.520
Even in Korea, the war, I mean
the guy who was my first sergeant

00:48:43.520 --> 00:48:48.610
who I didn't know, on the front
lines we just fought for two days.

00:48:48.610 --> 00:48:53.470
And I was going up the hill on top
and he said, "Blacks are difficult.

00:48:53.470 --> 00:48:54.770
I'll blow your brains out."

00:48:54.770 --> 00:48:57.120
And he had a .45 on me.

00:48:57.120 --> 00:49:01.380
And I decided at that point -- my
rifle was in the hole I was going

00:49:01.380 --> 00:49:05.290
to roll and get my gun
like you saw from a movie.

00:49:05.290 --> 00:49:09.300
Man, that .45 will blow a
hole straight through you.

00:49:09.300 --> 00:49:13.320
Because I've seen a
.45 shoot people.

00:49:13.320 --> 00:49:16.290
I went back to my hole
and stayed there.

00:49:16.290 --> 00:49:19.420
When it was time for us to
leave, he sent for me and said

00:49:19.420 --> 00:49:24.370
that he had made me lead the whole
company out there because being

00:49:24.370 --> 00:49:25.670
in front you get killed first.

00:49:25.670 --> 00:49:27.970
So he wanted me killed
out in front going out.

00:49:27.970 --> 00:49:30.390
That was the kind of stuff.

00:49:30.390 --> 00:49:33.900
So there was a lot of stuff
that we can laugh about,

00:49:33.900 --> 00:49:35.840
because if you don't
you cry about it.

00:49:35.840 --> 00:49:39.080
So but the racism was
just really heavy.

00:49:39.080 --> 00:49:43.530
Coming back, even in California
when we got back as heroes,

00:49:43.530 --> 00:49:48.510
because I got wounded, there in
California they started calling

00:49:48.510 --> 00:49:51.860
out the white soldiers' names
and then the called blacks.

00:49:51.860 --> 00:49:54.400
I never understood
that until we got on.

00:49:54.400 --> 00:49:55.940
But black and white
soldiers couldn't ride

00:49:55.940 --> 00:49:58.840
in the same train coach
across America.

00:49:58.840 --> 00:50:01.570
So we had to ride in
separate coaches.

00:50:01.570 --> 00:50:04.180
&gt;&gt; Guha Shankar: Okay, I'm going
to wrap this up because I want

00:50:04.180 --> 00:50:06.120
to make sure we have
some time for questions.

00:50:06.120 --> 00:50:09.040
The other collections that I
might sort of point you to,

00:50:09.040 --> 00:50:10.660
and my colleague Catherine
Kerst will talk

00:50:10.660 --> 00:50:13.620
about some of these a little later.

00:50:13.620 --> 00:50:17.320
But again in your packet you will
notice a URL for Born in Slavery:

00:50:17.320 --> 00:50:19.830
Slave Narratives from the
Federal Writers Project.

00:50:19.830 --> 00:50:23.330
And this is more than 2,300
first-person accounts of slavery

00:50:23.330 --> 00:50:25.620
and also photographs
of former slaves.

00:50:25.620 --> 00:50:28.460
And these narratives were
collected in the 1930's as part

00:50:28.460 --> 00:50:32.210
of the Federal Writers Project of
the Works Progress Administration,

00:50:32.210 --> 00:50:33.510
a federal project, by the way.

00:50:33.510 --> 00:50:38.250
And assembled and microfilmed
in 1941 as the Slave Narratives,

00:50:38.250 --> 00:50:40.620 position:56%
which is this mammoth 17-volume set.

00:50:40.620 --> 00:50:44.970
Published and available to you.

00:50:44.970 --> 00:50:47.770
And the online collect I think
might be interesting for you all

00:50:47.770 --> 00:50:51.240
because it actually has facsimiles
of all of the various narratives

00:50:51.240 --> 00:50:56.910
that have been digitized and put
up online so you can scan those.

00:50:56.910 --> 00:50:58.970
They have some subject
terms and so on,

00:50:58.970 --> 00:51:00.480
but they're not fully transcribed

00:51:00.480 --> 00:51:02.310
as are the Civil Rights
History project.

00:51:02.310 --> 00:51:04.830
So with that I'm going
to bring this to a close

00:51:04.830 --> 00:51:06.510
and thank you for your patience.

00:51:06.510 --> 00:51:08.390
I know it's already
been a little long.

00:51:08.390 --> 00:51:10.090
But we'll move on.

00:51:10.090 --> 00:51:11.500
And if there are any
questions I'd be happy

00:51:11.500 --> 00:51:14.270
to entertain them either
here or afterwards.

00:51:14.270 --> 00:51:17.530
&gt;&gt; In which way are you
connected with Story Corps?

00:51:17.530 --> 00:51:22.120
Because they have been going
around, you know collecting stories

00:51:22.120 --> 00:51:27.750
and I've even joined in
telling people about it.

00:51:27.750 --> 00:51:29.160
&gt;&gt; Guha Shankar: Story
Corps is archived here.

00:51:29.160 --> 00:51:32.150
The materials, the recordings
are archived here at the Library

00:51:32.150 --> 00:51:33.960
of the American Folk Life Center.

00:51:33.960 --> 00:51:36.430
Again, you can get access to those.

00:51:36.430 --> 00:51:38.090
It's an enormous volume of stories,

00:51:38.090 --> 00:51:40.730
so we can't provide online
access to all of them.

00:51:40.730 --> 00:51:42.930
But if you make an appointment
with our library staff,

00:51:42.930 --> 00:51:46.010 position:56%
with our American Folk Life Center
reference staff, you all can come in

00:51:46.010 --> 00:51:47.520
and listen to those stories.

00:51:47.520 --> 00:51:49.410
And some of them, as you
know, are available in bits

00:51:49.410 --> 00:51:50.820
and pieces here and there.

00:51:50.820 --> 00:51:53.050
That's the nuggets that
get extracted by NPR

00:51:53.050 --> 00:51:55.070
for their programs as well.

00:51:55.070 --> 00:51:56.460
So that's one way to do it.

00:51:56.460 --> 00:51:58.120
And participation is
an interesting one.

00:51:58.120 --> 00:52:00.430
We can direct you to the
Story Corps site and tell you

00:52:00.430 --> 00:52:03.920
when the mobile trucks and
buses show up in your area.

00:52:03.920 --> 00:52:08.400 position:56%
And you might want to think about
working on a way to get your stories

00:52:08.400 --> 00:52:11.990
or the individuals whose
stories you think are important

00:52:11.990 --> 00:52:17.330
into that archive.

00:52:17.330 --> 00:52:20.850
Yes ma'am?

00:52:22.050 --> 00:52:29.140
&gt;&gt; I wanted to share with
NABS that Mary Carter Smith

00:52:29.140 --> 00:52:35.110
and Victoria Smith were
recorded by Story Corps,

00:52:35.110 --> 00:52:39.280
so they are here with you.

00:52:39.280 --> 00:52:40.580
&gt;&gt; Guha Shankar: Yes.

00:52:40.580 --> 00:52:43.160
Thank you very much
for your contributions.

00:52:43.160 --> 00:52:50.510
I appreciate it.

00:52:50.510 --> 00:52:52.250
&gt;&gt; Elizabeth Peterson: All right.

00:52:52.250 --> 00:52:57.590
Oh, one more question and
then we'll take a break.

00:52:57.590 --> 00:53:01.960
&gt;&gt; Next year in 2017 will
be the 50th anniversary

00:53:01.960 --> 00:53:07.860
of the Detroit Riot, and I wanted
to know would it be possible to set

00:53:07.860 --> 00:53:13.380
up a Story Corps bus or
whatever at that time?

00:53:13.380 --> 00:53:14.680
&gt;&gt; Guha Shankar: That would
be a very good question

00:53:14.680 --> 00:53:16.190
and we can refer you to
the Story Corps folks.

00:53:16.190 --> 00:53:17.620
They might actually
be in partnership

00:53:17.620 --> 00:53:19.740
with the local organizations
in Detroit

00:53:19.740 --> 00:53:21.530
to do something like that already.

00:53:21.530 --> 00:53:23.700
I guess that's one of the things
I want to mention to you is

00:53:23.700 --> 00:53:28.050 position:56%
that we're the national library, but
we're not quite the national mafia

00:53:28.050 --> 00:53:32.060 position:56%
and we really believe that our local
partners are every bit as important

00:53:32.060 --> 00:53:33.620
with the collecting
efforts that you all do.

00:53:33.620 --> 00:53:37.800
So we would encourage you strongly
to contact your local libraries.

00:53:37.800 --> 00:53:41.630
They are the community centers at
their very best and they are places

00:53:41.630 --> 00:53:44.960
that your stories can be collected.

00:53:44.960 --> 00:53:46.930
They can help you with
documentation efforts.

00:53:46.930 --> 00:53:50.060
And they can help you find stories
and that's really what we say,

00:53:50.060 --> 00:53:53.850
is that the library is in
your backyard and it's one

00:53:53.850 --> 00:53:56.040
of the greatest resources
that we have.

00:53:56.040 --> 00:53:58.090
And we are always proud to
partner with those folks

00:53:58.090 --> 00:54:00.950
to do precisely the kind of
efforts you were talking about.

00:54:00.950 --> 00:54:02.250
Okay.

00:54:02.250 --> 00:54:05.110
&gt;&gt; Elizabeth Peterson: Okay,
so let's come back at 10:40

00:54:05.110 --> 00:54:07.200
and you'll hear more
about the collections

00:54:07.200 --> 00:54:08.500
at the Library of Congress.

00:54:08.500 --> 00:54:09.800
Thank you.

00:54:09.800 --> 00:54:11.100
[ Applause ]

00:54:11.100 --> 00:54:12.400
[ Singing ]

00:54:12.400 --> 00:54:13.700
[ Applause ]

00:54:13.700 --> 00:54:27.590
&gt;&gt; VM: So I'm guessing
by the amount of cheers

00:54:28.920 --> 00:54:39.760
that this person is no
stranger to y'all's association.

00:54:39.760 --> 00:54:41.060
So this was a recording of Linda

00:54:41.060 --> 00:54:48.280
at the National Storytelling
Festival, somewhere in the 1970's.

00:54:48.280 --> 00:54:50.350
And I'm glad that you enjoy that.

00:54:50.350 --> 00:54:51.650
Good morning.

00:54:51.650 --> 00:54:54.010
I am Valda Morris and I'm
a processing archivist here

00:54:54.010 --> 00:54:57.080
at the American Folk Life Center.

00:54:57.080 --> 00:55:01.030
And I want to piggyback
off of something

00:55:01.030 --> 00:55:08.290
that my colleague Guha
said about we are archives

00:55:08.290 --> 00:55:10.000
and we give the raw materials.

00:55:10.000 --> 00:55:12.520
And it's up to you
all to find that gold.

00:55:12.520 --> 00:55:16.060
And Linda, Ms. Goss was
actually here a couple years ago.

00:55:16.060 --> 00:55:19.600
She had won one of our grants.

00:55:19.600 --> 00:55:23.330
And she actually was able
to research and she was able

00:55:23.330 --> 00:55:26.670 position:56%
to enrich our collections even more
because she was able to fill in some

00:55:26.670 --> 00:55:29.360
of the gaps and the
questions that I had

00:55:29.360 --> 00:55:31.100
about the National
Storytelling Festival.

00:55:31.100 --> 00:55:34.630
So that's just you know, another
plug for you all to come in

00:55:34.630 --> 00:55:39.220
and do some research here at
our American Folk Life Center.

00:55:39.220 --> 00:55:42.620
Okay, so I would like to
personally welcome all of y'all

00:55:42.620 --> 00:55:45.800
and every single member of
NABS to the Library of Congress

00:55:45.800 --> 00:55:47.840
to the American Folk
Life Center and to DC.

00:55:47.840 --> 00:55:52.250
I'm really excited here this
morning to be able to share some

00:55:52.250 --> 00:55:56.100 position:56%
of the wonderful storyteller
resources that you have just seen --

00:55:56.100 --> 00:55:58.520
that you're about to
see from my colleagues

00:55:58.520 --> 00:56:00.090
and that you're about
to see from me.

00:56:00.090 --> 00:56:03.740
That are actually housed here at
the American Folk Life Center.

00:56:03.740 --> 00:56:06.230
Some of these resources
are not just on paper

00:56:06.230 --> 00:56:08.430
or what we call manuscript
materials.

00:56:08.430 --> 00:56:11.680
But they are sound recordings,
they're graphic images, you know,

00:56:11.680 --> 00:56:13.930
photos and prints and stuff.

00:56:13.930 --> 00:56:16.120
And moving images.

00:56:16.120 --> 00:56:20.740
We have also digitized a large
amount of these materials

00:56:20.740 --> 00:56:23.510
and we're working on
digitizing another set.

00:56:23.510 --> 00:56:28.990
And some of these that are not
digitized, you can also request

00:56:28.990 --> 00:56:32.230
and we could do it
for you on-demand.

00:56:32.230 --> 00:56:36.620
Today I will share some of the
recordings that are both sound

00:56:36.620 --> 00:56:40.520
and moving images that are
part of story collections here

00:56:40.520 --> 00:56:42.500
at the American Folk Life Center.

00:56:42.500 --> 00:56:45.960
The first one is a James
Carpenter collection

00:56:45.960 --> 00:56:47.820
and then the other would
be the International

00:56:47.820 --> 00:56:49.120
Storytelling Collection.

00:56:49.120 --> 00:56:56.330
The earliest recordings of
American Folk Tales that we have

00:56:56.330 --> 00:57:02.390
in our archives that are actually
done on wax cylinder recordings.

00:57:02.390 --> 00:57:05.120
So just imagine like a
candle with a hole in it

00:57:05.120 --> 00:57:08.930
and they have grooves in there.

00:57:08.930 --> 00:57:11.880
That's one of the earliest
recordings

00:57:11.880 --> 00:57:16.180
that we have of sound recordings.

00:57:16.180 --> 00:57:20.380
And these were made in the
1930's by Harvard-trained scholar

00:57:20.380 --> 00:57:25.640
from Mississippi, a person by the
name of James Madison Carpenter.

00:57:25.640 --> 00:57:30.470
Carpenter was best known
for his ballads and songs

00:57:30.470 --> 00:57:36.800
and he collected a lot of stories
in England, Scotland and Wales.

00:57:36.800 --> 00:57:40.640
However, he was also a
teacher at Duke University.

00:57:40.640 --> 00:57:46.070
And that's where he identified a
janitor there by the name of John.

00:57:46.070 --> 00:57:47.700
And these became important

00:57:47.700 --> 00:57:51.150
because they were the
earliest known field recordings

00:57:51.150 --> 00:57:55.640
of African American folktales
within the United States.

00:57:55.640 --> 00:58:01.210 position:56%
I'm going to play you a brief sample
of James' wax cylinder recording

00:58:01.210 --> 00:58:05.970
of John telling the story
of Jack and the Devil.

00:58:05.970 --> 00:58:09.110
So you image that these
are some old recordings,

00:58:09.110 --> 00:58:11.620
so the quality is not
going to be that great.

00:58:11.620 --> 00:58:14.610
But if you listen clearly
you will hear when he begins.

00:58:14.610 --> 00:58:15.910
"Once upon a time there
was a boy named Jack."

00:58:15.910 --> 00:58:18.600
&gt;&gt; Once upon a time there was
a boy by the name of Jack.

00:58:18.600 --> 00:58:19.900
[ Inaudible ]

00:58:19.900 --> 00:59:58.660
&gt;&gt; VM: All right, I know that
wasn't the best, but we have a lot

00:59:58.660 --> 01:00:02.280
of these recordings in our
James Carpenter Collection,

01:00:02.280 --> 01:00:04.600
just waiting to be
discovered by you.

01:00:04.600 --> 01:00:09.480
Carpenter completed his field
recordings and manuscripts.

01:00:09.480 --> 01:00:16.630
His complete field recordings and
manuscripts will be online in 2016

01:00:16.630 --> 01:00:19.100
as part of the digital archives.

01:00:19.100 --> 01:00:21.600
The Full English, hosted
by the English Folk

01:00:21.600 --> 01:00:26.110
and Song Society in London.

01:00:26.110 --> 01:00:32.010
Okay. The International
Story Collection is one

01:00:32.010 --> 01:00:37.680
of our largest collections
that we received here in 2001.

01:00:37.680 --> 01:00:41.500
It was actually 500,000 items came.

01:00:41.500 --> 01:00:45.200
And it documents the beginning

01:00:45.200 --> 01:00:47.160
of the International
Storytelling Center

01:00:47.160 --> 01:00:49.950
and all the different
variations that it had.

01:00:49.950 --> 01:00:54.340 position:56%
And of course you know it hosts the
International Storytelling Festival.

01:00:54.340 --> 01:00:59.240
And have featured many black
storytellers over the ages.

01:00:59.240 --> 01:01:02.930
Mary Catherine Smith, Linda
Goss, Jackie Torrence,

01:01:02.930 --> 01:01:06.590
Charlotte Bri Alsom, which I
think I see her down there.

01:01:06.590 --> 01:01:08.600
Donna Washington, Bro.

01:01:08.600 --> 01:01:13.210 position:56%
Blue, Lyn Cabral, Paul Keems Douglas
and that's just to name a few.

01:01:13.210 --> 01:01:15.470
We have many, many
others in the collection.

01:01:15.470 --> 01:01:21.590
In 2001 we actually digitized the
real-to-real sound recordings,

01:01:21.590 --> 01:01:23.280
which documents the beginnings

01:01:23.280 --> 01:01:26.890
of the festival, right
up to the 1990's.

01:01:26.890 --> 01:01:30.920
And then we continue to
digitize the docs which came,

01:01:30.920 --> 01:01:35.780
which kind of like took up from
that era right up to the 2000's.

01:01:35.780 --> 01:01:43.910 position:56%
We know we receive a lot of the
storytelling stories on hard drives,

01:01:43.910 --> 01:01:48.200
so we just upload them
directly to our servers.

01:01:48.200 --> 01:01:51.520
The collection is an
open collection.

01:01:51.520 --> 01:01:55.310
We have a corporate
agreement with them,

01:01:55.310 --> 01:01:59.090
which means we receive their
materials every three years

01:01:59.090 --> 01:02:03.280
for the life of the
Center and of the festival.

01:02:03.280 --> 01:02:08.220
In 2012, in an effort to
celebrate the 40th anniversary

01:02:08.220 --> 01:02:10.390
with the International
Storytelling Center,

01:02:10.390 --> 01:02:14.470
we at the American Folk Life
digitized a set of tapes

01:02:14.470 --> 01:02:20.200
and we put it all together and we
produced a piece entitled Echoes

01:02:20.200 --> 01:02:23.940
from the National Storytelling
Festival.

01:02:23.940 --> 01:02:25.770
So I opened with Linda
Goss as you saw,

01:02:25.770 --> 01:02:27.440
and that was part of this piece.

01:02:27.440 --> 01:02:30.260
And now I'm going to
close with another icon

01:02:30.260 --> 01:02:33.050
to the storytelling festival.

01:02:33.050 --> 01:02:35.220
Her name is Jackie Torrence.

01:02:35.220 --> 01:02:38.560
And I would like to thank
you for your patience.

01:02:38.560 --> 01:02:42.140
And enjoy DC and enjoy
the Library of Congress

01:02:42.140 --> 01:02:44.280
and we're looking forward
to serving you more.

01:02:44.280 --> 01:02:45.580
[ Applause ]

01:02:45.580 --> 01:02:51.580
&gt;&gt; Now Brer Rabbit
was a fine fisherman.

01:02:51.580 --> 01:02:55.730
All he had to do was go down
to the river, drop his pole in

01:02:55.730 --> 01:02:59.450
and with inside of 10 minutes
he'd have 20 fish right

01:02:59.450 --> 01:03:01.230
up there on the bank.

01:03:01.230 --> 01:03:03.150
He was a good fisherman.

01:03:03.150 --> 01:03:06.250
Brer Rabbit had a good friend,
his best friend in fact,

01:03:06.250 --> 01:03:11.090
whose name was Brer Raccoon.

01:03:11.090 --> 01:03:15.420
But Brer Rabbit called
him Brer Coon for short.

01:03:15.420 --> 01:03:19.060
Brer Coon couldn't fish a toad.

01:03:19.060 --> 01:03:21.700
He didn't even like fish.

01:03:21.700 --> 01:03:25.500
What he liked was frogs.

01:03:25.500 --> 01:03:29.270 position:56%
Brer Coon would go down to the river
with a big tow sack and he'd fill

01:03:29.270 --> 01:03:32.300
that sack full of frogs and
he'd take them home to his wife

01:03:32.300 --> 01:03:33.600
and his wife would say, "Woohoo!

01:03:33.600 --> 01:03:35.400
Frogs!"

01:03:35.400 --> 01:03:40.110
[ Laughter ]

01:03:40.110 --> 01:03:44.650
Now Brer Coon loved frogs.

01:03:44.650 --> 01:03:50.620
But the frogs was getting tired
of Brer Coon catching them.

01:03:50.620 --> 01:03:53.540
So they had a big frog meeting.

01:03:53.540 --> 01:03:58.290
And they said, "We's got to
do something about Brer Coon.

01:03:58.290 --> 01:04:01.350
He's coming down here
and catching us.

01:04:01.350 --> 01:04:06.570
We got to find out where he
is and when he's coming."

01:04:06.570 --> 01:04:10.990
So they decided to put a
lookout frog on the bank.

01:04:10.990 --> 01:04:14.310
They needed a frog with big eyes.

01:04:14.310 --> 01:04:18.350
A frog that could hear
good from a long way.

01:04:18.350 --> 01:04:22.560
A frog that could see
real good, see him coming.

01:04:22.560 --> 01:04:24.790
They only frog they could see

01:04:24.790 --> 01:04:29.090
with them qualifications
was the bullfrog.

01:04:29.090 --> 01:04:34.610
So they put him down on the
riverbank to watch for Brer Coon.

01:04:34.610 --> 01:04:39.900
Brer Coon would get a half
a mile down to the river

01:04:39.900 --> 01:04:43.020
and the bullfrog would see him.

01:04:43.020 --> 01:04:46.650
And the bullfrog would warn
all the rest of the frogs.

01:04:46.650 --> 01:04:49.610
And you could hear him
say, "Here he comes."

01:04:49.610 --> 01:04:50.910
[ Laughter ]

01:04:50.910 --> 01:04:53.550
"Here he comes."

01:04:53.550 --> 01:04:54.850
[ Laughter ]

01:04:54.850 --> 01:05:00.150
"Here he comes."

01:05:00.150 --> 01:05:03.790
And the little frogs would echo
what the bullfrog had said.

01:05:03.790 --> 01:05:05.090
"Here he comes."

01:05:05.090 --> 01:05:06.390
[ Laughter ]

01:05:06.390 --> 01:05:08.360
"Here he comes.

01:05:08.360 --> 01:05:10.310
Here he comes."

01:05:10.310 --> 01:05:13.280
Well by the time Brer
Coon got to the river,

01:05:13.280 --> 01:05:17.050
all the frogs had leaped
into the water.

01:05:17.050 --> 01:05:19.120
And there wasn't a frog in sight.

01:05:19.120 --> 01:05:22.530
And ole Brer Coon couldn't go in
the water because he couldn't swim.

01:05:22.530 --> 01:05:26.470
He'd go home with that empty
tow sack and his wife would say,

01:05:26.470 --> 01:05:31.280
"Is you coming in here
without a frog?"

01:05:31.280 --> 01:05:33.690
[ Laughter ]

01:05:33.690 --> 01:05:35.210
And Brer Coon would
say, "Now wait a minute.

01:05:35.210 --> 01:05:36.510
I can't catch them frogs.

01:05:36.510 --> 01:05:37.810
They done got to wild.

01:05:37.810 --> 01:05:39.460
I've been down there
and every time I go

01:05:39.460 --> 01:05:41.500 position:56%
down there they say, "Here he comes.

01:05:41.500 --> 01:05:45.320
Here he comes.

01:05:45.320 --> 01:05:46.910
Here he comes."

01:05:46.910 --> 01:05:48.210
[ Laughter ]

01:05:48.210 --> 01:05:49.510
&gt;&gt; Catherine Kerst:
High, I'm Cathy Kerst.

01:05:49.510 --> 01:05:51.790
I'm a folklorist and archivist
in the American Folk Life center.

01:05:51.790 --> 01:05:54.070
And I'll be talking
to you about some

01:05:54.070 --> 01:05:57.910
of the Zora Neale Hurston materials
that we have in our archive

01:05:57.910 --> 01:06:00.640
and also elsewhere in
the Library of Congress.

01:06:00.640 --> 01:06:03.490
We are thrilled to have
you here, really pleased.

01:06:03.490 --> 01:06:10.010
In 1938, Zora Neale Hurston wrote
an essay called Folklore in Music,

01:06:10.010 --> 01:06:13.490
intended to be published in a
work called The Florida Negro.

01:06:13.490 --> 01:06:17.180
In it she wrote, as
Betsy has already said,

01:06:17.180 --> 01:06:19.880
"Folklore is the boiled
down juice of human living.

01:06:19.880 --> 01:06:24.080
It does not belong to any
special time, place nor people.

01:06:24.080 --> 01:06:27.630
In folklore, as in everything
else that people create,

01:06:27.630 --> 01:06:31.160
the world is a great
big old serving platter.

01:06:31.160 --> 01:06:34.410
And all the places are
like eating plates.

01:06:34.410 --> 01:06:37.150
Whatever is on the plates
must come out of the platter,

01:06:37.150 --> 01:06:39.630
but each plate has
a flavor of its own.

01:06:39.630 --> 01:06:42.500
Because the people take
the universal stuff

01:06:42.500 --> 01:06:44.930
and season it to suit themselves.

01:06:44.930 --> 01:06:50.470
And this local flavor is what
is known as originality."

01:06:50.470 --> 01:06:52.820
She wrote so beautifully.

01:06:52.820 --> 01:06:56.340
Known by many as a literary
figure, a gifted author,

01:06:56.340 --> 01:06:58.690
Hurston was also an astute

01:06:58.690 --> 01:07:01.790
and perceptive ethnographer
and interviewer.

01:07:01.790 --> 01:07:06.150
She studied anthropology at
Columbia University in the mid-20's

01:07:06.150 --> 01:07:10.050
where she was encouraged to
travel to her native Florida

01:07:10.050 --> 01:07:11.980 position:56%
to gather African American folklore.

01:07:11.980 --> 01:07:13.520
Which she did.

01:07:13.520 --> 01:07:15.820
The American Folk Life
Center holds a variety

01:07:15.820 --> 01:07:19.900
of fascinating Hurston materials
relating to this research.

01:07:19.900 --> 01:07:24.120
Our Hurston collections include
for the most part audio recordings

01:07:24.120 --> 01:07:27.150
that she collected from
individuals or groups,

01:07:27.150 --> 01:07:30.440
or were made of her own
speaking and singing

01:07:30.440 --> 01:07:33.530
in Florida and Georgia in 1935.

01:07:33.530 --> 01:07:36.080
In Haiti in 1936.

01:07:36.080 --> 01:07:40.290
In Washington, D. C. at the
National Folk Festival in 1938.

01:07:40.290 --> 01:07:42.970
And during her work for
the Federal Writers Project

01:07:42.970 --> 01:07:46.490
in Florida in 1938 and -39.

01:07:46.490 --> 01:07:51.750
We also have a few
letters in our collection.

01:07:51.750 --> 01:07:54.910
Here is a photo of Hurston
which we believe was taken

01:07:54.910 --> 01:07:57.750
at a recording site in 1935.

01:07:57.750 --> 01:08:00.440
The photo resides in the prints

01:08:00.440 --> 01:08:03.590
and photographs division
here at the library.

01:08:03.590 --> 01:08:07.450
It was really hard to decide what
audio recordings to play for you

01:08:07.450 --> 01:08:10.380
since so much of it
is so compelling.

01:08:10.380 --> 01:08:13.740
I've chosen three selections
from the late 1930's

01:08:13.740 --> 01:08:15.960
that feature Hurston
speaking and singing

01:08:15.960 --> 01:08:20.840
and demonstrate her ethnographic
eye and documentary style.

01:08:20.840 --> 01:08:24.450
In April of 1938 Hurston
joined the staff

01:08:24.450 --> 01:08:26.620
of the Florida Federal
Writers Project

01:08:26.620 --> 01:08:31.150
to collect African American
folklore in Florida.

01:08:31.150 --> 01:08:35.160 position:56%
The Federal Writers Project was part
of the Works Progress Administration

01:08:35.160 --> 01:08:38.130
where authors, historians,
artists and folklorists

01:08:38.130 --> 01:08:42.430
like Hurston were hired to collect
folklore, history, oral narratives,

01:08:42.430 --> 01:08:45.340 position:56%
songs and more to document the lives

01:08:45.340 --> 01:08:48.870
of ordinary Americans
from many backgrounds.

01:08:48.870 --> 01:08:53.430
As part of her work, Hurston
collected folk speech, work songs,

01:08:53.430 --> 01:08:57.200
tall tales and lies,
narratives about preachers,

01:08:57.200 --> 01:08:59.090
children's games and much more.

01:08:59.090 --> 01:09:03.260
I'm focusing today on the
recordings where you get a chance

01:09:03.260 --> 01:09:06.660
to hear Hurston's voice
and experience her method

01:09:06.660 --> 01:09:09.250
of documenting folk culture.

01:09:09.250 --> 01:09:12.410
These recordings are all on the
Library of Congress's website.

01:09:12.410 --> 01:09:14.660
This is a description
of track lining.

01:09:14.660 --> 01:09:20.050
&gt;&gt; Now when the men are lining,
they put the rail down and then

01:09:20.050 --> 01:09:25.020
of course the captain, he squats
straddle of it and looks down it

01:09:25.020 --> 01:09:30.810
so he can tell when it's lined
up in exact line with the others.

01:09:30.810 --> 01:09:33.340
And he'll say, "Shove it over."

01:09:33.340 --> 01:09:34.830
And the captain, he'll
say, "Send it back."

01:09:34.830 --> 01:09:37.680
And when they get it
exactly in line,

01:09:37.680 --> 01:09:39.420
he'll tell them, "Join it ahead."

01:09:39.420 --> 01:09:41.190
But they corrupted
that to "Joiner ahead."

01:09:41.190 --> 01:09:43.530
And all of them said, "Joiner
head," for "Join it ahead."

01:09:43.530 --> 01:09:50.770
And so this song is about lining
and the rhythm goes with this.

01:09:50.770 --> 01:09:54.540
They put this lining bar,
this long steel bar, crow bar,

01:09:54.540 --> 01:09:57.870
between their legs so they have
greater push and pull back on it.

01:09:57.870 --> 01:09:59.170
[ Inaudible ]

01:09:59.170 --> 01:10:00.470
Their back is to the rail.

01:10:00.470 --> 01:10:01.770
[ Inaudible ]

01:10:01.770 --> 01:10:03.070
They're pulling up on the bar.

01:10:03.070 --> 01:10:05.120 position:56%
They don't have to look at the rail,

01:10:05.120 --> 01:10:11.660
because that's the captain's
job to see when it's right.

01:10:11.660 --> 01:10:16.480
&gt;&gt; How do they get
it under the rail?

01:10:17.590 --> 01:10:20.930
&gt;&gt; They just push the flange of
this lining bar onto the rail

01:10:20.930 --> 01:10:22.770
and then pull back on it.

01:10:22.770 --> 01:10:25.680
&gt;&gt; Do they have to look back at it?

01:10:25.680 --> 01:10:27.130
&gt;&gt; Catherine Kerst: You
can hear Herbert Kelford,

01:10:27.130 --> 01:10:31.160
one of the other Federal Writers
Project workers asking all sorts

01:10:31.160 --> 01:10:32.460
of questions.

01:10:32.460 --> 01:10:33.760
So Zora was interested

01:10:33.760 --> 01:10:38.160
in documenting how things were done
sometimes in traditional culture.

01:10:38.160 --> 01:10:44.490
And the next recording
is Shove It Over,

01:10:44.490 --> 01:10:50.120 position:56%
which is actually the work song that
goes along with the track lining.

01:10:50.120 --> 01:10:54.610
Sort of like a call and response
chant used on the railroad.

01:10:54.610 --> 01:10:59.350 position:56%
&gt;&gt; This song is called Shove It Over

01:10:59.350 --> 01:11:05.150
and it's the lining rhythm
pretty generally distributed all

01:11:05.150 --> 01:11:07.590
over Florida.

01:11:07.590 --> 01:11:23.270
It was sung to me by Charlie Jones

01:11:23.270 --> 01:11:45.190
on the railroad construction
camp near Lakeland, Florida.

01:11:45.190 --> 01:11:49.350
&gt;&gt; How long ago?

01:11:49.350 --> 01:11:58.830
&gt;&gt; I gathered that in '33, 1933.

01:11:58.830 --> 01:12:00.130
[ Singing ]

01:12:00.130 --> 01:12:06.230
&gt;&gt; Catherine Kerst: And here is
Uncle Bud, which is a social song,

01:12:06.230 --> 01:12:09.640
a body juke song sung by Hurston.

01:12:09.640 --> 01:12:13.470
It was collected by Stetson
Kennedy who was recording her

01:12:13.470 --> 01:12:17.620
and whose voice you also
hear on this recording.

01:12:17.620 --> 01:12:20.940
1939 in Jacksonville.

01:12:23.890 --> 01:12:26.790
&gt;&gt; Uncle Bud is not a works song.

01:12:26.790 --> 01:12:29.790
It's a sort of social
song for amusement

01:12:29.790 --> 01:12:31.380
and it's so widely distributed.

01:12:31.380 --> 01:12:34.390
It's growing all the time
by incremental repetition.

01:12:34.390 --> 01:12:37.730
And it is known all over the south.

01:12:37.730 --> 01:12:42.560
No matter where you go, you
can find versions of Uncle Bud.

01:12:42.560 --> 01:12:46.210 position:56%
And it's a favorite song and the men
get to working in every kind of way.

01:12:46.210 --> 01:12:48.280
And they just yell
down to Uncle Bud.

01:12:48.280 --> 01:12:49.620
And nobody in particular leads it.

01:12:49.620 --> 01:12:52.330
Everybody puts in his
verse when he gets ready.

01:12:52.330 --> 01:12:56.830
And Uncle Bud goes
and goes and goes.

01:12:56.830 --> 01:13:00.350
&gt;&gt; Wow. Was it sung before
the respectable ladies?

01:13:00.350 --> 01:13:02.910
&gt;&gt; Never. It's one
of those juke songs.

01:13:02.910 --> 01:13:06.040
Any woman that they sing Uncle
Bud in front of is a juke woman.

01:13:06.040 --> 01:13:10.200 position:56%
&gt;&gt; I thought you heard it from them.

01:13:10.200 --> 01:13:13.500
&gt;&gt; Yes, I heard it from them.

01:13:13.500 --> 01:13:18.980
[Singing] Uncle Bud's
a man, a man like this.

01:13:18.980 --> 01:13:22.240
He can't get a woman,
got to use his fists.

01:13:22.240 --> 01:13:28.180
Uncle Bud, Uncle Bud, Uncle
Bud, Uncle Bud, Uncle Bud.

01:13:28.180 --> 01:13:31.980
Oh go to town, got to hurry back,

01:13:31.980 --> 01:13:35.160
Uncle Bud's got something
I sure do like.

01:13:35.160 --> 01:13:41.550
Uncle Bud, Uncle Bud, Uncle
Bud, Uncle Bud, Uncle Bud.

01:13:41.550 --> 01:13:45.740
Oh, little cat, big cat, little
bitty kitten, gonna work that tale,

01:13:45.740 --> 01:13:47.470
but they don't stop shitting.

01:13:47.470 --> 01:13:53.060
Uncle Bud, Uncle Bud, Uncle
Bud, Uncle Bud, Uncle Bud.

01:13:53.060 --> 01:13:56.260
Uncle Bud got caught knee jerking,

01:13:56.260 --> 01:13:59.300
Uncle Bud's got gout
that sure needs working.

01:13:59.300 --> 01:14:04.900
Uncle Bud, Uncle Bud, Uncle
Bud, Uncle Bud, Uncle Bud.

01:14:04.900 --> 01:14:06.790
&gt;&gt; Catherine Kerst: You can
hear the rest of it online.

01:14:06.790 --> 01:14:08.090
[ Laughter ]

01:14:08.090 --> 01:14:13.010 position:56%
So I have a few photographs from
the prints and photographs division.

01:14:13.010 --> 01:14:16.860
These are from Hurston's
1935 research with Edenville,

01:14:16.860 --> 01:14:20.810
Florida children documenting
their games and songs.

01:14:20.810 --> 01:14:24.470
With the field research done
by Hurston and the researchers

01:14:24.470 --> 01:14:29.500
in the 1930's during the New Deal
Era, the lives, music, speech,

01:14:29.500 --> 01:14:34.000
memories and artistic efforts of
ordinary Americans were documented.

01:14:34.000 --> 01:14:38.520
The Library of Congress holds a
huge amount of New Deal materials.

01:14:38.520 --> 01:14:41.050
And in the American Folk
Life Center we were honored

01:14:41.050 --> 01:14:44.860
to also house a wealth of
this material including these

01:14:44.860 --> 01:14:48.540
and other stunning examples
of Hurston's voice, vitality,

01:14:48.540 --> 01:14:51.690
with and deep cultural
understanding.

01:14:51.690 --> 01:14:54.810
The Hurston recordings I
played for you, plus many more,

01:14:54.810 --> 01:14:57.660
are accessible online at
the library's website.

01:14:57.660 --> 01:15:02.210
And on the handout in your packet
you will find a finding aid

01:15:02.210 --> 01:15:05.590
to Zora Neale Hurston materials
throughout the library.

01:15:05.590 --> 01:15:08.870
Manuscript division, prints
and photographs and so on.

01:15:08.870 --> 01:15:12.480
I recommend that you explore them.

01:15:12.480 --> 01:15:16.440
And now I want to talk very
briefly about Voices from the Days

01:15:16.440 --> 01:15:21.030
of Slavery: Former
Slaves Tell their Stories.

01:15:21.030 --> 01:15:28.420 position:56%
So if you go to the American Folk
Life Center homepage and look at all

01:15:28.420 --> 01:15:33.020
of the online collections,
there are quite a few.

01:15:33.020 --> 01:15:36.530
There is Voices from
the Days of Slavery.

01:15:36.530 --> 01:15:39.400
And I just urge you to
take a look at this site.

01:15:39.400 --> 01:15:43.580
The site includes seven hours of
recorded interviews that took place

01:15:43.580 --> 01:15:49.210
between 1932 and 1975
in nine southern states.

01:15:49.210 --> 01:15:53.550
On these recordings, 23
persons were interviewed born

01:15:53.550 --> 01:15:57.960
between 1823 and the early 1860's.

01:15:57.960 --> 01:16:02.600
In the interviews they discuss
how they felt about slavery,

01:16:02.600 --> 01:16:06.310
about slaveholders,
the coercion of slaves,

01:16:06.310 --> 01:16:08.870
their families and about freedom.

01:16:08.870 --> 01:16:12.380
The variety of topics, personal
experiences and feelings

01:16:12.380 --> 01:16:16.580
that are conveyed are incredibly
moving and quite remarkable.

01:16:16.580 --> 01:16:21.210
Being able to actually able
to hear their voices and all.

01:16:21.210 --> 01:16:24.580
Included in the collection is an
interview that Hurston took part

01:16:24.580 --> 01:16:29.500
in with Wallace Porterman
in 1935 in Georgia.

01:16:29.500 --> 01:16:33.610
This whole collection of audio
recordings is available here

01:16:33.610 --> 01:16:34.910
on this site.

01:16:34.910 --> 01:16:39.090
And it includes transcriptions
of the narratives to help

01:16:39.090 --> 01:16:43.250
in understanding dialect
and understanding some

01:16:43.250 --> 01:16:46.560
of the older recordings
that are a little scratchy.

01:16:46.560 --> 01:16:47.860
Anyway, thank you.

01:16:47.860 --> 01:16:49.770
Thank you so much for coming.

01:16:49.770 --> 01:16:51.720
It's a pleasure having you here.

01:16:51.720 --> 01:16:54.980
And we urge you to
come and visit us.

01:16:54.980 --> 01:16:57.010
There's a lot to explore.

01:16:57.010 --> 01:17:06.860
Thank you very much.

01:17:06.860 --> 01:17:09.110
[ Applause ]

01:17:09.110 --> 01:17:12.580
&gt;&gt; Guha Shankar: Hello again.

01:17:12.580 --> 01:17:17.580
Right, this is going to be
the high-speed version of how

01:17:17.580 --> 01:17:22.800
to conduct audio documentation,
or cultural documentation.

01:17:22.800 --> 01:17:25.770
Before we do that, I wanted to
make a couple of announcements.

01:17:25.770 --> 01:17:27.750
First of all I want to
thank a couple of people

01:17:27.750 --> 01:17:29.630
who have not been acknowledged
so far.

01:17:29.630 --> 01:17:31.890
Frist and foremost or events
production coordinator,

01:17:31.890 --> 01:17:34.820
Thea Austin who has put this
program together for you.

01:17:34.820 --> 01:17:39.310
There she is right there.

01:17:39.310 --> 01:17:40.610
[ Applause ]

01:17:40.610 --> 01:17:41.910
And Dana Bell who is in the back,

01:17:41.910 --> 01:17:43.710
who put together the wonderful
list of resources for you.

01:17:43.710 --> 01:17:46.740
[ Applause ]

01:17:46.740 --> 01:17:51.780
And many others too numerous to
name at this particular point.

01:17:51.780 --> 01:17:54.770
By rights, this next session,
which I'm going to do at top speed

01:17:54.770 --> 01:17:57.850
in about 15 minutes, leaving
some time for questions,

01:17:57.850 --> 01:18:01.240
is generally the focus on various
training programs that we conduct

01:18:01.240 --> 01:18:04.380
at the library through
various institutional partners

01:18:04.380 --> 01:18:09.320
across the country to orient
people like yourselves who wish

01:18:09.320 --> 01:18:12.840 position:56%
to do cultural documentation in your
communities for various purposes.

01:18:12.840 --> 01:18:17.700
Whether it's for podcasts,
whether it's for collecting stories

01:18:17.700 --> 01:18:22.470
of elders and community members,
class projects and so on.

01:18:22.470 --> 01:18:26.090
And the things that we often
get asked go along the lines of,

01:18:26.090 --> 01:18:27.390
"How do I do it?

01:18:27.390 --> 01:18:28.840
What equipment do I use?

01:18:28.840 --> 01:18:30.140
And how do I do interviews?"

01:18:30.140 --> 01:18:35.610
I'm going to concentrate on those
three things because it's a topic

01:18:35.610 --> 01:18:38.650
which as I said, covers
about three weeks in duration

01:18:38.650 --> 01:18:40.990
when we teach our annual
field schools.

01:18:40.990 --> 01:18:42.800
This is not for the faint-hearted.

01:18:42.800 --> 01:18:47.340 position:56%
How many of you have done collecting
oral history interviews yourselves?

01:18:47.340 --> 01:18:51.860
Well, you know, I should get you
all to come up here and do this.

01:18:51.860 --> 01:18:53.590
[ Laughter ]

01:18:53.590 --> 01:18:57.370
But I think they will tell you
that be prepared, be careful

01:18:57.370 --> 01:19:00.620
and be cautious about
what you are embarking on.

01:19:00.620 --> 01:19:02.850
It's not a project for
the faint of heart.

01:19:02.850 --> 01:19:06.070
Our colleague Todd Harvey,
very generously said

01:19:06.070 --> 01:19:08.810 position:56%
that he would take the documentation
that you're going to collect.

01:19:08.810 --> 01:19:14.050
I will caution you that while
we are welcoming of collections,

01:19:14.050 --> 01:19:19.120
we also are acutely aware, given
where we stand in terms of trying

01:19:19.120 --> 01:19:21.350
to archive and sustain
these materials,

01:19:21.350 --> 01:19:24.240
and sustainability
is a keyword for us.

01:19:24.240 --> 01:19:26.600 position:56%
When we say sustain we mean not just

01:19:26.600 --> 01:19:31.650 position:56%
to have these stories accessible the
day after you record them and so on,

01:19:31.650 --> 01:19:33.600
but generations down the line.

01:19:33.600 --> 01:19:36.030
The recordings that you
have here from the Lomax's,

01:19:36.030 --> 01:19:38.490
from the Civil Rights
History Project,

01:19:38.490 --> 01:19:41.890 position:56%
from the Federal Writers Project and
so on, have stood the test of time.

01:19:41.890 --> 01:19:43.740
Because there is a body of people

01:19:43.740 --> 01:19:47.100
and there's an entire
institution devoted to making sure

01:19:47.100 --> 01:19:50.110
that these materials are
available and accessible to you.

01:19:50.110 --> 01:19:53.860
I do not believe, unless you are
really well-funded trust fund

01:19:53.860 --> 01:19:56.310
hippies, that you've got
that kind of manpower

01:19:56.310 --> 01:19:58.440
and resources at your disposal.

01:19:58.440 --> 01:20:01.150
That's where the library
and other institutions

01:20:01.150 --> 01:20:03.790
in your community come into play.

01:20:03.790 --> 01:20:07.490
But even then, even with all
of our interests in maintaining

01:20:07.490 --> 01:20:09.810
and preserving our collections,
there are certain things

01:20:09.810 --> 01:20:13.780
that we would ask that you
do in terms of making sure

01:20:13.780 --> 01:20:16.200
that your materials are
going to be available

01:20:16.200 --> 01:20:18.830
and accessible over
the course of time.

01:20:18.830 --> 01:20:20.380
One of the things that we ask

01:20:20.380 --> 01:20:23.840
in the first place is
understand what the parameters

01:20:23.840 --> 01:20:25.760
of your project are.

01:20:25.760 --> 01:20:29.130
To take inventory of the
resources that you have

01:20:29.130 --> 01:20:33.160
so that you can then embark upon a
project of cultural documentation

01:20:33.160 --> 01:20:35.700
and interviewing very carefully.

01:20:35.700 --> 01:20:39.780
One of the things I will show
you here is on our website.

01:20:39.780 --> 01:20:43.670
This particular thing is called
the cultural documentation, methods

01:20:43.670 --> 01:20:45.320
and techniques, on that site.

01:20:45.320 --> 01:20:49.430
And within the site we have
provided some basic guidelines

01:20:49.430 --> 01:20:52.840
and best practices documents
that you may wish to consult.

01:20:52.840 --> 01:20:54.780
There are many of these
around the country.

01:20:54.780 --> 01:20:58.510 position:56%
Many institutions like Baylor's Oral
History Association have similar

01:20:58.510 --> 01:20:59.920
sets of guidelines.

01:20:59.920 --> 01:21:02.810
The Smithsonian Institution's
Folk Life programs,

01:21:02.810 --> 01:21:07.130 position:56%
the Center for Folk Life and
Heritage Research have their own set

01:21:07.130 --> 01:21:09.140
of rubrics and best practices.

01:21:09.140 --> 01:21:12.180
We generally bring these materials
together from our colleagues

01:21:12.180 --> 01:21:15.710
across these institutions because
we've been at it for a long time

01:21:15.710 --> 01:21:19.050
and our roles as ethnographers, as
folklorists, as anthropologists,

01:21:19.050 --> 01:21:22.750
as ethnomusicologists, and we
always lean upon our colleagues

01:21:22.750 --> 01:21:25.060
to keep us abreast
of best practices.

01:21:25.060 --> 01:21:27.670
So one of the things I would
urge you to do is when you get

01:21:27.670 --> 01:21:29.590
to the site and you're
interested in trying to figure

01:21:29.590 --> 01:21:32.210
out what the parameters of
such projects are is to go

01:21:32.210 --> 01:21:36.410 position:56%
to this link here you'll see, called
cultural documentation guidelines.

01:21:36.410 --> 01:21:39.700
And within that you
have various aspects

01:21:39.700 --> 01:21:43.870
of what the broad categories
are that one needs to think

01:21:43.870 --> 01:21:47.150
about when engaging in projects
of cultural documentation.

01:21:47.150 --> 01:21:49.210
Some of these are more
relevant to you than others.

01:21:49.210 --> 01:21:51.330
I'm not planning on going
through all of them.

01:21:51.330 --> 01:21:53.990
But one of the very first
things we suggest is

01:21:53.990 --> 01:21:57.500
that you actually do a
project plan, all right?

01:21:57.500 --> 01:22:00.840
And what we're asking you to
do again is take an inventory

01:22:00.840 --> 01:22:02.510
of the resources that you have.

01:22:02.510 --> 01:22:07.150 position:56%
If you don't already have equipment,
if you don't already have a place

01:22:07.150 --> 01:22:10.910
to have these materials rest,
then you're going to have to think

01:22:10.910 --> 01:22:12.860
about it at the head end.

01:22:12.860 --> 01:22:17.510
Many project runs afoul
of one very basic thing.

01:22:17.510 --> 01:22:20.380
Nobody thought through what
the end result was going to be

01:22:20.380 --> 01:22:22.400
and where it was going to live.

01:22:22.400 --> 01:22:24.700
People come to these
projects and they say,

01:22:24.700 --> 01:22:27.840
"We're going to document this
particular community member

01:22:27.840 --> 01:22:31.190 position:56%
or these particular community
members because there's an urgency."

01:22:31.190 --> 01:22:33.280
You get halfway through
the project and you find

01:22:33.280 --> 01:22:35.960
that you don't know
where to store them.

01:22:35.960 --> 01:22:39.600
You find that you don't
have an idea of what sorts

01:22:39.600 --> 01:22:41.710
of topics you might
want to embark upon.

01:22:41.710 --> 01:22:43.010
You have a broad idea,

01:22:43.010 --> 01:22:46.600
but the specific historical
facts are not available to you.

01:22:46.600 --> 01:22:49.830
You find out that your
technical needs are inadequate

01:22:49.830 --> 01:22:52.330
to the subject matter at hand.

01:22:52.330 --> 01:22:57.700 position:56%
So there's a very simple spreadsheet
that our colleagues Paula Johnson

01:22:57.700 --> 01:23:00.610
at the Smithsonian
Institution, she's a curator there

01:23:00.610 --> 01:23:04.380 position:56%
and a folklorist, and our own David
Taylor who used to work with us here

01:23:04.380 --> 01:23:08.730
at the Library of Congress, have
put together several years ago.

01:23:08.730 --> 01:23:11.230
And I've modified this
over the course of time.

01:23:11.230 --> 01:23:14.410
But it asks you to take
account of very basic things

01:23:14.410 --> 01:23:18.990
like a budget, what are your goals.

01:23:18.990 --> 01:23:21.260
What other kind of
research has been done?

01:23:21.260 --> 01:23:24.010
Do you have a body of
materials to draw upon?

01:23:24.010 --> 01:23:25.320
Would you need to consult

01:23:25.320 --> 01:23:27.710
for instance International
Storytelling Collection to figure

01:23:27.710 --> 01:23:29.410
out if the people whom you want

01:23:29.410 --> 01:23:31.500
to interview have already
been interviewed?

01:23:31.500 --> 01:23:34.040
Or if they've been interviewed,
if they've been documented,

01:23:34.040 --> 01:23:35.340
is there something else

01:23:35.340 --> 01:23:37.780
in the historical record
that needs fleshing out?

01:23:37.780 --> 01:23:42.030
So thorough research is one of
the things that we ask you to do.

01:23:42.030 --> 01:23:45.110
And then you just precisely ask,
where are you going to do the work?

01:23:45.110 --> 01:23:46.670
Is it a national collecting project

01:23:46.670 --> 01:23:49.240
like this Civil Rights
History Project?

01:23:49.240 --> 01:23:50.540
Probably not.

01:23:50.540 --> 01:23:52.470
I mean, you've got to have
money for funding and you have

01:23:52.470 --> 01:23:54.550
to have funding for
travel and so on.

01:23:54.550 --> 01:23:56.530
So maybe it's in your backyard.

01:23:56.530 --> 01:23:59.420
One of the things we ask you
is are you planning on --

01:23:59.420 --> 01:24:03.610
what sort of documentation
are you going to do?

01:24:03.610 --> 01:24:04.910
Is it audio recording?

01:24:04.910 --> 01:24:06.430
In my view that's the best

01:24:06.430 --> 01:24:09.190
and the simplest method
of recording stories.

01:24:09.190 --> 01:24:12.890
Video recording and videotaping,
it looks great, it looks sexy,

01:24:12.890 --> 01:24:14.880
all hi-def and all of that.

01:24:14.880 --> 01:24:16.880
If you don't have the expertise
to do that, you're going to have

01:24:16.880 --> 01:24:19.940
to bring some people in who can
help you do that documentation.

01:24:19.940 --> 01:24:21.980
That adds to the resources
that you're going to need.

01:24:21.980 --> 01:24:25.200
That adds to the money, right?

01:24:25.200 --> 01:24:26.740
You're going to have
to get equipment.

01:24:26.740 --> 01:24:28.040
You're going to have to buy it.

01:24:28.040 --> 01:24:29.340
You're going to have to rent it.

01:24:29.340 --> 01:24:30.640
You're going to have to
do something with it.

01:24:30.640 --> 01:24:32.020
Even if you were to
work in partnership

01:24:32.020 --> 01:24:35.090
with a particular institution,
you're going to have

01:24:35.090 --> 01:24:38.340
to understand what their technical
limitations are, who they can lend

01:24:38.340 --> 01:24:40.180
to the project and so on.

01:24:40.180 --> 01:24:41.480
Are you going to do photography?

01:24:41.480 --> 01:24:43.230
Those photographs, images, as Cathy

01:24:43.230 --> 01:24:47.410
and others have shown you are
really important to give a face

01:24:47.410 --> 01:24:52.010
to the voices that you hear
online or anywhere else.

01:24:52.010 --> 01:24:58.650
And all of these materials, all of
these kinds of very detailed things

01:24:58.650 --> 01:25:00.980
that we're asking you to
consider are important

01:25:00.980 --> 01:25:03.330
because they will play
a part in how well

01:25:03.330 --> 01:25:06.640
and how well-sustained your
materials are going to be

01:25:06.640 --> 01:25:08.770
in an archival situation.

01:25:08.770 --> 01:25:12.810
I do not believe -- I heard
a young lady ask a question

01:25:12.810 --> 01:25:14.500
over here about recording.

01:25:14.500 --> 01:25:17.300
That the stories that she
wants to collect are going

01:25:17.300 --> 01:25:19.040
to just live in here and the now.

01:25:19.040 --> 01:25:20.590
Again, I go back to
that point earlier:

01:25:20.590 --> 01:25:23.750
you're trying to make these
publicly available and acceptable

01:25:23.750 --> 01:25:26.120
to generations of people
that come after you.

01:25:26.120 --> 01:25:28.830
You do that through
your storytelling.

01:25:28.830 --> 01:25:31.770 position:56%
Consider the fact that the materials
that you collect, the documentation,

01:25:31.770 --> 01:25:35.190
the firsthand experiences that
you collect, have to live.

01:25:35.190 --> 01:25:37.590
If they don't live, then they
don't enter public memory.

01:25:37.590 --> 01:25:40.140
They don't enter American
historical consciousness.

01:25:40.140 --> 01:25:41.440
So it's up to you.

01:25:41.440 --> 01:25:43.580
Because you guys are
mediating between the voice

01:25:43.580 --> 01:25:47.130 position:56%
of the person whom you're collecting
and everybody else in this room

01:25:47.130 --> 01:25:48.550
and people you don't even know.

01:25:48.550 --> 01:25:51.620
Right? That's the generational
aspect of all of this.

01:25:51.620 --> 01:25:54.800
So think through all of these
questions very carefully.

01:25:54.800 --> 01:26:02.610
Now let me see if I can -- so the
project plan is available online

01:26:02.610 --> 01:26:05.630
in this particular website.

01:26:05.630 --> 01:26:10.680
The second thing we get asked is,
what equipment do we want to use?

01:26:10.680 --> 01:26:12.720
The Library of Congress,
being a public institution,

01:26:12.720 --> 01:26:16.130 position:56%
can neither confirm nor deny that
there are better grades of equipment

01:26:16.130 --> 01:26:20.230
than others, although I could tell
you that off-camera somewhere.

01:26:20.230 --> 01:26:24.670
So we rely again on our colleagues
like Doug Boyd, who is the director

01:26:24.670 --> 01:26:27.840
of the Oral History
Association's Oral History

01:26:27.840 --> 01:26:29.440
in the Digital Age Project.

01:26:29.440 --> 01:26:33.120
And this to me is one
of the great tools.

01:26:33.120 --> 01:26:35.640
I keep hoping for the day
and keep toying with the idea

01:26:35.640 --> 01:26:37.940
that there might be a
similar set of rubrics

01:26:37.940 --> 01:26:40.400
that we could use for
video recording.

01:26:40.400 --> 01:26:43.030
Video recording is a
whole other animal.

01:26:43.030 --> 01:26:47.580
What we're dealing here with is
almost a transparent interaction

01:26:47.580 --> 01:26:50.610
in terms of audio recording
between you as a collector

01:26:50.610 --> 01:26:51.950
and the person that
you're recording.

01:26:51.950 --> 01:26:53.400
There's not a lot of equipment.

01:26:53.400 --> 01:26:55.460
There's not a lot of people
trailing wires behind them

01:26:55.460 --> 01:26:56.760
as is the case with video.

01:26:56.760 --> 01:26:58.580
You don't have to have
a video operator.

01:26:58.580 --> 01:27:03.410
You can with practice get really
good at conducting an interview,

01:27:03.410 --> 01:27:06.740
a story collecting project
with just you and the person

01:27:06.740 --> 01:27:08.460
that you wish to document.

01:27:08.460 --> 01:27:13.100
And to that end, people say, "What
kind of equipment should I get?"

01:27:13.100 --> 01:27:15.280
And we say, well, here's
what you do.

01:27:15.280 --> 01:27:17.500
You go in here and you go
to this particular website.

01:27:17.500 --> 01:27:20.720
This is the Oral History
in the Digital Age site.

01:27:20.720 --> 01:27:26.590
And right here is this
thing called go to ask Doug.

01:27:26.590 --> 01:27:31.570 position:56%
And digital expert Doug Boyd, fellow
folklorist, oral historian and all

01:27:31.570 --> 01:27:35.340
around good guy has done this
really, really neat thing here.

01:27:35.340 --> 01:27:37.970
And what he says is,
it's very simple.

01:27:37.970 --> 01:27:39.620
It's radio buttons and checkboxes.

01:27:39.620 --> 01:27:42.360
If I can do it, you can do it.

01:27:42.360 --> 01:27:45.880
And basically says things like it
goes back to your project planning.

01:27:45.880 --> 01:27:48.380
How much money do you
have to get a recorder?

01:27:48.380 --> 01:27:51.570
Right? He asks you
question like quality.

01:27:51.570 --> 01:27:53.060 position:56%
What is it you want to do with this?

01:27:53.060 --> 01:27:54.480
Is it professional level quality?

01:27:54.480 --> 01:27:57.150
Are you the person who's
facile with technical equipment

01:27:57.150 --> 01:28:00.560
that you can say, "I want the best
and the brightest, the lates"?

01:28:00.560 --> 01:28:04.180
Then you check this box that
says professional quality.

01:28:04.180 --> 01:28:08.610
But you still want to keep it
somewhere in the $500 range.

01:28:08.610 --> 01:28:12.760
And then Doug very
helpfully has told you

01:28:12.760 --> 01:28:14.910
that he considers this
the best in class.

01:28:14.910 --> 01:28:16.970
This is something that
people like Doug can do.

01:28:16.970 --> 01:28:20.330 position:56%
That is to say they can actually put
their hands on pieces of equipment.

01:28:20.330 --> 01:28:23.700
And I can guarantee you
that you have some assurance

01:28:23.700 --> 01:28:25.460
that it is what he says it is.

01:28:25.460 --> 01:28:29.110 position:56%
What he says it is in the box will
actually be what's delivered to you.

01:28:29.110 --> 01:28:32.490
One of the things that we
often say is that you know

01:28:32.490 --> 01:28:33.790
that people are lying
when they tell you

01:28:33.790 --> 01:28:38.030
to have archival quality
CD's and DVD's.

01:28:38.030 --> 01:28:39.600
There's no such thing.

01:28:39.600 --> 01:28:42.980
Right? But with this particular
project you can understand

01:28:42.980 --> 01:28:47.510
as Doug says that there are these
classes of recorders and every one

01:28:47.510 --> 01:28:51.950 position:56%
of them comes with an explanation of
what the equipment is, what it does,

01:28:51.950 --> 01:28:55.550
tells you where to go buy them.

01:28:55.550 --> 01:28:58.870
All right?

01:28:58.870 --> 01:29:00.570
Making sense?

01:29:00.570 --> 01:29:01.870
All right.

01:29:01.870 --> 01:29:05.040
So that's one of the
recommendations that we would have.

01:29:05.040 --> 01:29:07.340
So mark this down if it's
not already in your package,

01:29:07.340 --> 01:29:09.300
prepared very nicely by Dana.

01:29:09.300 --> 01:29:13.060
Right? We can come back to this
in just a second, all right?

01:29:13.060 --> 01:29:14.660
Whoops, what happened here?

01:29:14.660 --> 01:29:23.120
Hang on. Yes, thank you.

01:29:23.120 --> 01:29:26.470
All right, and let me go back

01:29:26.470 --> 01:29:32.670
to one more particular
aspect of this website.

01:29:32.670 --> 01:29:34.740
So far we talked about
project planning,

01:29:34.740 --> 01:29:36.240
understanding what you want to do

01:29:36.240 --> 01:29:38.160
and who you want to
do it with and so on.

01:29:38.160 --> 01:29:42.700
We talk about very basic equipment
and now comes what happens

01:29:42.700 --> 01:29:48.220
when you go to the actual
interview situation?

01:29:48.220 --> 01:29:51.130
And this should be no
surprise to those of you

01:29:51.130 --> 01:29:52.780
who have done cultural
documentation,

01:29:52.780 --> 01:29:54.160
who have done interviews.

01:29:54.160 --> 01:29:56.840
But one of the things we do is
we say these are best practices

01:29:56.840 --> 01:29:59.670
and guidelines for
conducting recorded interviews.

01:29:59.670 --> 01:30:03.490
And not all of these
are going to come

01:30:03.490 --> 01:30:07.470
up in your particular
situation, but check these out.

01:30:07.470 --> 01:30:11.890
Sort of take them to heart and
understand what they are in terms

01:30:11.890 --> 01:30:15.510
of your own particular
documentary situation.

01:30:15.510 --> 01:30:17.730
We just go through a list of stuff.

01:30:17.730 --> 01:30:19.030
It's not a template.

01:30:19.030 --> 01:30:20.330
It's not the Bible.

01:30:20.330 --> 01:30:21.630
We're not saying you
have to follow it

01:30:21.630 --> 01:30:24.030
from point one to point
20 or whatever.

01:30:24.030 --> 01:30:28.210
But this enables you to get the
story and the voices of people

01:30:28.210 --> 01:30:31.680
that you're wanting to document
in as clear and as concise

01:30:31.680 --> 01:30:33.460
and as precise a fashion
as possible.

01:30:33.460 --> 01:30:41.260
And above all, one of the things
that we say is right here.

01:30:41.260 --> 01:30:45.330 position:56%
That I think is probably as
germain to you all as anything else.

01:30:45.330 --> 01:30:48.540
And all it says is you're
not just after the facts.

01:30:48.540 --> 01:30:54.770
You want stories, narratives
and explanations, right?

01:30:54.770 --> 01:30:58.270
You're storytellers yourselves,
so you just have to figure out how

01:30:58.270 --> 01:31:02.560
to mesh the things that you do with
the people whom you're talking to.

01:31:02.560 --> 01:31:06.450
And elicit those stories so that
it makes sense for you and for all

01:31:06.450 --> 01:31:08.180
of us who will hear it later on.

01:31:08.180 --> 01:31:12.030
Okay. So my 10 minutes are up and I
think the buses are about to come.

01:31:12.030 --> 01:31:16.240
But I will be happy to
take some -- yes ma'am.

It just says avoid questions
-- it's just a guideline.

01:31:20.100 --> 01:31:23.780
It says avoid questions that can
be answered with a yes or a no.

01:31:23.780 --> 01:31:25.080
You're not just after the fact.

01:31:25.080 --> 01:31:28.200
You want stories, narratives
and explanations.

Some of the pictures we have online.

01:31:56.080 --> 01:31:59.450
Some of them are in the
public domain and can be used,

01:31:59.450 --> 01:32:02.720
but some of them we ask that
you figure out the provenance

01:32:02.720 --> 01:32:06.610
of each collection because they
are copyrighted by the donors.

And there's also user and performer
rights that you want to be aware of.

01:32:09.710 --> 01:32:13.150

they've been donated to the library

01:32:13.150 --> 01:32:15.860

contact the performer,

01:32:17.890 --> 01:32:20.650
up in those photographs
and/or their estates.

01:32:20.650 --> 01:32:21.950
Just as a courtesy.

01:32:21.950 --> 01:32:23.250
Say, "Can we use this
in our own work?"

01:32:23.250 --> 01:32:25.160
Okay? Anything else?

01:32:25.160 --> 01:32:36.930
GShankar. First name
is Guha, G-u-h-a.

01:32:36.930 --> 01:32:50.460
@LOC.gov. Or you can just get
me through FolkLife@LOC.gov.

01:32:50.460 --> 01:32:52.810
And all that information
is available

01:32:52.810 --> 01:33:00.710
at our website right at
the LOC.gov/folklife.

01:33:00.710 --> 01:33:03.420
And all of that information is
in your packets, by the way.

01:33:03.420 --> 01:33:05.570
A lot of this information
is in your packets,

01:33:05.570 --> 01:33:07.700
so you're quite welcome
to contact us.

01:33:07.700 --> 01:33:09.000
Thea has final announcements.

01:33:09.000 --> 01:33:12.960 position:56%
&gt;&gt; Thea Austin: Yes, so there are --

01:33:12.960 --> 01:33:18.560
as your glorious leader here has
told you, there are three buses.

01:33:18.560 --> 01:33:22.260
One group of people is going to
be staying behind a little bit,

01:33:22.260 --> 01:33:23.560
waiting for the last bus.

01:33:23.560 --> 01:33:27.490
And I urge you to take a look at
the Civil Rights History exhibit.

01:33:27.490 --> 01:33:29.690
That's one floor up,
on the second floor.

01:33:29.690 --> 01:33:32.350
If you're going to be staying
here for a little while longer,

01:33:32.350 --> 01:33:34.660
hang back a little bit and
let the people who are going

01:33:34.660 --> 01:33:37.720
to be exiting the building
first go through the door.

01:33:37.720 --> 01:33:39.130
We have a couple of staff people

01:33:39.130 --> 01:33:42.690
to help you either take the
elevator or take the stairs.

01:33:42.690 --> 01:33:44.470
There's one exit.

01:33:44.470 --> 01:33:47.090
And we'll help you
get back to the foyer

01:33:47.090 --> 01:33:49.700
where you got off the
bus originally.

01:33:49.700 --> 01:33:51.000
So thank you again.

01:33:51.000 --> 01:33:52.590
Let's thank Guha for
his presentation.

01:33:52.590 --> 01:33:54.420
[ Applause ]

01:33:54.420 --> 01:33:57.440
Valda, Cathy Kerst.

01:33:57.440 --> 01:33:58.740
All of the staff.

01:33:58.740 --> 01:34:00.040
Thank you so much for coming.

01:34:00.040 --> 01:34:02.760
We really enjoyed presenting
our collections to you today.

01:34:02.760 --> 01:34:04.750
And we hope that you'll
come back and do research

01:34:04.750 --> 01:34:06.920
with the American Folk
Life center at the library.

01:34:06.920 --> 01:34:09.730
&gt;&gt; Guha Shankar: Thank you.

01:34:09.730 --> 01:34:13.590
&gt;&gt; This has been a presentation
of the Library of Congress.

01:34:13.590 --> 01:34:19.090
