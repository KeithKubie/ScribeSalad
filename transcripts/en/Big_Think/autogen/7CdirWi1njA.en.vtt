a lot of hot times and cold times back

00:00:10.730 --> 00:00:10.740
a lot of hot times and cold times back
 

00:00:10.740 --> 00:00:12.860
a lot of hot times and cold times back
and forth and forth and back and what I

00:00:12.860 --> 00:00:12.870
and forth and forth and back and what I
 

00:00:12.870 --> 00:00:14.839
and forth and forth and back and what I
do is I study deep time by looking at

00:00:14.839 --> 00:00:14.849
do is I study deep time by looking at
 

00:00:14.849 --> 00:00:17.090
do is I study deep time by looking at
co2 levels and relative temperatures and

00:00:17.090 --> 00:00:17.100
co2 levels and relative temperatures and
 

00:00:17.100 --> 00:00:19.820
co2 levels and relative temperatures and
we are coming out of a cold time and

00:00:19.820 --> 00:00:19.830
we are coming out of a cold time and
 

00:00:19.830 --> 00:00:22.790
we are coming out of a cold time and
moving into a hot time however for this

material particular time in history we

material particular time in history we
 

00:00:25.050 --> 00:00:27.259
material particular time in history we
should be moving back in a cold time if

00:00:27.259 --> 00:00:27.269
should be moving back in a cold time if
 

00:00:27.269 --> 00:00:29.089

time to go cold again and yet doesn't

isn't at the tropics that's where
 

00:02:07.830 --> 00:02:09.350
isn't at the tropics that's where
temperatures change the least but it's

00:02:09.350 --> 00:02:09.360
temperatures change the least but it's
 

00:02:09.360 --> 00:02:11.210
temperatures change the least but it's
at the poles where you have the greatest

00:02:11.210 --> 00:02:11.220
at the poles where you have the greatest
 

00:02:11.220 --> 00:02:14.240
at the poles where you have the greatest
absolute change and so we found a 10

00:02:14.240 --> 00:02:14.250

couple of direct and indirect ways but

00:02:39.140 --> 00:02:39.150
couple of direct and indirect ways but
 

00:02:39.150 --> 00:02:40.790
couple of direct and indirect ways but
the most direct way is to take the

the most direct way is to take the
 

00:02:40.800 --> 00:02:43.250

and just run an isotope check on it you

00:02:55.280 --> 00:02:55.290
and just run an isotope check on it you
 

00:02:55.290 --> 00:02:57.110

measuring ancient temperatures so all we

00:03:14.600 --> 00:03:14.610
measuring ancient temperatures so all we
 

00:03:14.610 --> 00:03:16.670
measuring ancient temperatures so all we
try to do is understand see what

00:03:16.670 --> 00:03:16.680
try to do is understand see what
 

00:03:16.680 --> 00:03:18.470

happened to ocean temperatures across
 

00:03:18.480 --> 00:03:21.440
happened to ocean temperatures across
this 2 or 3 million year interval so we

00:03:21.440 --> 00:03:21.450
this 2 or 3 million year interval so we
 

00:03:21.450 --> 00:03:23.300
this 2 or 3 million year interval so we
collect the specimens we take them back

00:03:23.300 --> 00:03:23.310
collect the specimens we take them back
 

00:03:23.310 --> 00:03:25.040

to our labs in America we run them

00:03:25.040 --> 00:03:25.050

through the machines it came up with the
 

00:03:26.520 --> 00:03:28.699
through the machines it came up with the
temperature curve so you have a direct

00:03:28.699 --> 00:03:28.709
temperature curve so you have a direct
 

00:03:28.709 --> 00:03:30.980

measurement now say the last 5 million

00:03:30.980 --> 00:03:30.990
measurement now say the last 5 million
 

00:03:30.990 --> 00:03:32.330

and sure enough those are the places

00:03:36.920 --> 00:03:36.930
and sure enough those are the places
 

00:03:36.930 --> 00:03:39.110

that should warm up the most if you had

00:03:39.120 --> 00:03:41.449
that should warm up the most if you had
a global warming scenario and in fact

00:03:41.449 --> 00:03:41.459
a global warming scenario and in fact
 

00:03:41.459 --> 00:03:45.590
a global warming scenario and in fact
that's exactly what happened

00:03:45.590 --> 00:03:45.600
 

00:03:45.600 --> 00:03:48.410
well the differences are just simply

00:03:48.410 --> 00:03:48.420
well the differences are just simply
 

00:03:48.420 --> 00:03:50.570
well the differences are just simply
what is causing it I mean in the past

00:03:50.570 --> 00:03:50.580
what is causing it I mean in the past
 

00:03:50.580 --> 00:03:53.240
what is causing it I mean in the past

reality it's not even the cars and see

00:03:57.830 --> 00:03:57.840

this is a misnomer that I see we think

00:04:00.800 --> 00:04:00.810
this is a misnomer that I see we think
 

00:04:00.810 --> 00:04:02.270
this is a misnomer that I see we think
of all those cars and all the exhaust

00:04:02.270 --> 00:04:02.280
of all those cars and all the exhaust
 

00:04:02.280 --> 00:04:03.920
of all those cars and all the exhaust
from them and surely that is a problem

00:04:03.920 --> 00:04:03.930
from them and surely that is a problem
 

00:04:03.930 --> 00:04:07.010
from them and surely that is a problem
but it's the power plants that make the

but it's the power plants that make the
 

00:04:07.020 --> 00:04:09.650
but it's the power plants that make the
steel that make the cars that's the

00:04:09.650 --> 00:04:09.660
steel that make the cars that's the
 

00:04:09.660 --> 00:04:11.510
steel that make the cars that's the
problem power plants with a big problem

00:04:11.510 --> 00:04:11.520
problem power plants with a big problem
 

00:04:11.520 --> 00:04:13.490
problem power plants with a big problem
in this planet and that's why we really

00:04:13.490 --> 00:04:13.500
in this planet and that's why we really
 

00:04:13.500 --> 00:04:16.610
in this planet and that's why we really
have to think seriously about China with

00:04:16.610 --> 00:04:16.620
have to think seriously about China with
 

00:04:16.620 --> 00:04:19.790
