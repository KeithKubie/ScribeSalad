Hi, I’m Adriene Hill and Welcome back to
Crash Course Statistics.

00:00:06.520 --> 00:00:10.680
In this series we’ve been talking a lot
about how often you see data and statistics

00:00:10.680 --> 00:00:13.170
on the news and on social media.

00:00:13.170 --> 00:00:17.640
There are all sorts of studies and data sets
promising the keys to a better life.

00:00:17.640 --> 00:00:19.840
Coffee is good for you. No wait.

00:00:19.840 --> 00:00:21.920
It’s killing you So what do you trust?

00:00:21.920 --> 00:00:30.900
INTRO

00:00:30.900 --> 00:00:35.900
Journalism has many goals to inform, expose,
help people make better decisions about their

00:00:35.900 --> 00:00:37.620
communities and their lives.

00:00:37.620 --> 00:00:42.580
But, the only way journalism matters--is if
people read it or watch it or listen to it.

00:00:42.580 --> 00:00:46.180
Journalists have to capture the attention
of their audience and help them connect with

00:00:46.180 --> 00:00:46.820
the story.

00:00:46.820 --> 00:00:51.560
Case studies and observational studies can
be great source materials for articles or

00:00:51.570 --> 00:00:52.560
podcast.

00:00:52.570 --> 00:00:55.829
But, it’s always important to look at both
the quality of the science.

00:00:55.829 --> 00:00:58.280
And the quality of the journalism.

00:00:58.280 --> 00:01:02.250
If there’s a study without a control group
or with non-randomized design it’s going

00:01:02.250 --> 00:01:03.969
to be less reliable.

00:01:03.969 --> 00:01:08.081
And if a journalist doesn’t ask those questions,
or just doesn’t include the answers in her

00:01:08.081 --> 00:01:09.820
story, how are you going to know?

00:01:09.820 --> 00:01:15.220
Back in 2015, newspapers around the world
ran stories heralding Chocolate as a way to

00:01:15.220 --> 00:01:16.259
lose weight.

00:01:16.260 --> 00:01:16.960
It sounded great.

00:01:16.960 --> 00:01:19.799
But turns out it wasn’t good journalism
or good science.

00:01:19.800 --> 00:01:25.400
A science journalist and PhD named John Bohannon
created this story by doing a real, randomized

00:01:25.400 --> 00:01:28.920
study, but one that was intentionally riddled
with flaws.

00:01:28.929 --> 00:01:33.500
It was meant to be a way to show that academic
journals would publish the very flawed study.

00:01:33.500 --> 00:01:34.680
And so would news outlets.

00:01:34.680 --> 00:01:41.380
The goal, writes Bohannon, was to demonstrate how easy it is to turn bad science into big headlines.

00:01:41.400 --> 00:01:42.280
And it worked.

00:01:42.280 --> 00:01:45.620
Once the study was published and the press
release went out journalists jumped on it.

00:01:45.630 --> 00:01:49.780
Bohannon says that many outlets ran the story
without ever contacting him.

00:01:49.780 --> 00:01:54.619
Very few reporters asked about the number
of subjects they tested-- only 16--and no

00:01:54.620 --> 00:01:56.440
he says, reported that number.

00:01:56.440 --> 00:02:01.960
Also says Bohannon the stories that ran didn’t quote any outside researchers for corroboration.

00:02:01.960 --> 00:02:06.980
And while it is disappointing that you can’t
add some Cadbury to your diet and lose weight,

00:02:06.980 --> 00:02:12.260
and maybe your aunt keeps quoting this study
to you as she downs that 5th and 6th bon-bon,

00:02:12.260 --> 00:02:17.070
but bad science and bad scientific journalism
is not always that harmless.

00:02:17.070 --> 00:02:22.110
Most clinical studies base their conclusions
on statistical tests that give researchers--and

00:02:22.110 --> 00:02:26.780
the rest of us a quantifiable way to measure
the evidence that the study provides.

00:02:26.780 --> 00:02:31.380
For example, when a reputable doctor claims
that Ibuprofen increases the risk of fertility

00:02:31.380 --> 00:02:35.771
issues in men, it’s because there was a
study with a group that took Ibuprofen and

00:02:35.771 --> 00:02:40.930
a control group that didn’t, and the subjects
taking Ibuprofen showed a tangible increase

00:02:40.930 --> 00:02:43.070
in some measure of infertility.

00:02:43.070 --> 00:02:44.260
But which measure?

00:02:44.260 --> 00:02:46.850
And was the control group given a placebo?

00:02:46.850 --> 00:02:50.180
An article that you see on Yahoo health, probably
won’t tell you in fact this one doesn’t.

00:02:50.180 --> 00:02:53.560
For that information, you have to go to the
original academic article, and those can be

00:02:53.560 --> 00:02:54.640
kinda dense.

00:02:54.640 --> 00:02:58.570
It turns out that this study did have a placebo
control group, and it measured infertility

00:02:58.570 --> 00:03:04.240
in a clinically respectable way, by measuring
levels of fertility related hormones.

00:03:04.240 --> 00:03:08.820
But these facts are important when considering
how trustworthy the conclusion of a study

00:03:08.820 --> 00:03:11.980
is, and a lot of news articles don’t have them.

00:03:11.980 --> 00:03:16.540
As a side note if this study was done in rats
instead of humans the conclusion that Ibuprofen

00:03:16.540 --> 00:03:20.760
increases the risk of fertility issues in
men would not be as strongly supported!

00:03:20.760 --> 00:03:22.560
Let’s go to the Thought Bubble.

00:03:22.560 --> 00:03:26.320
Imagine that you’re going about your morning
as usual, sipping your coffee and scrolling

00:03:26.320 --> 00:03:31.920
through the latest news when you see an article with the title “Miracle Food causes weight loss!"

00:03:31.940 --> 00:03:34.220
You want to fit better into your jeans so,
you click through.

00:03:34.220 --> 00:03:39.580
You see that the miracle food is called Targ,
AND the results were “statistically significant”so

00:03:39.580 --> 00:03:40.830
it’ seems legit.

00:03:40.830 --> 00:03:44.550
You jump in your car and drive down to the
local grocery store and see that Targ is on

00:03:44.550 --> 00:03:45.300
sale!

00:03:45.300 --> 00:03:48.840
So you pick up the largest pack and start
eating you’re already feeling stronger

00:03:48.850 --> 00:03:53.660
But then you begin to experience side effects
like heartburn and stomach ulcers and a desire

00:03:53.660 --> 00:03:54.660
to fight.

00:03:54.660 --> 00:03:58.590
The article you read didn’t mention that
when researchers considered the over 20,000

00:03:58.590 --> 00:04:04.460
subjects that the weight loss was only about
1/10th of a pound more for Targ eaters.

00:04:04.460 --> 00:04:08.080
That’s not very much maybe not worth these side effects.

00:04:08.090 --> 00:04:12.360
When a study reports something as significant,
you probably assume that this means that it’s

00:04:12.360 --> 00:04:16.690
really gonna matter, but this isn’t always
the case, since significant means something

00:04:16.690 --> 00:04:20.380
different in statistics than in everyday English.

00:04:20.380 --> 00:04:25.260
And Science journalists can misuse this confusion
by not mentioning how big of an effect was

00:04:25.260 --> 00:04:26.200
observed.

00:04:26.210 --> 00:04:27.210
Thanks Thought Bubble!

00:04:27.210 --> 00:04:32.120
We don’t have time to read all the academic
articles on even one topic that affects us.

00:04:32.120 --> 00:04:36.700
Take what gets called “text neck”-- a
condition that includes sore neck muscles

00:04:36.710 --> 00:04:39.360
from looking down at your phone and laptop
all the time.

00:04:39.370 --> 00:04:45.889
A Google Scholar search for Academic articles
about “Text Neck” returns over 180 results

00:04:45.889 --> 00:04:47.680
and that’s only since 2013.

00:04:47.680 --> 00:04:52.820
There’s no way that you could read all of
those without exacerbating your already sore neck.

00:04:52.820 --> 00:04:58.420
So we need people like scientific journalists
who can distill all those articles into digestible--and

00:04:58.420 --> 00:05:01.300
engaging--pieces for us to consume.

00:05:01.300 --> 00:05:05.040
It’s helpful to be skeptical but we should
keep reading about science.

00:05:05.040 --> 00:05:08.440
When reading a science story it’s important
to note a couple things: who wrote it, who

00:05:08.449 --> 00:05:12.009
published it, who did the science, and who
funded the science.

00:05:12.009 --> 00:05:15.699
If an article that tells you that drinking
Diet Coke is good for your teeth and is on

00:05:15.699 --> 00:05:20.550
the Coke website, your suspicion should be
raised more so than if it was published by

00:05:20.550 --> 00:05:21.830
Scientific American.

00:05:21.830 --> 00:05:26.479
You should also consider who funded and completed
the research the article is based on.

00:05:26.479 --> 00:05:30.449
If you read an article that claims a rare
fruit juice will reduce your blood pressure

00:05:30.449 --> 00:05:35.040
and stave of cancer and you see that study
was funded by the juice company.

00:05:35.040 --> 00:05:36.120
Be suspicious.

00:05:36.120 --> 00:05:39.740
Not every study funded by a company is inherently
flawed.

00:05:39.750 --> 00:05:45.140
Science cost money, it can be expensive, and while there are sources of funding from governments and other neutral

00:05:45.159 --> 00:05:49.569
organizations, the reality is that often the
people who are willing to pay to have the

00:05:49.569 --> 00:05:54.000
research done are the companies who have a
vested interest in the results.

00:05:54.000 --> 00:05:59.120
Sometimes to get the research done, researchers
need to partner with these organization.

00:05:59.120 --> 00:06:02.100
Privately funded research can be done well.

00:06:02.100 --> 00:06:05.980
Another thing to watch for in science and
health journalism is whether the claims made

00:06:05.980 --> 00:06:09.749
in the headline actually match the claims
made in the story.

00:06:09.749 --> 00:06:13.819
You don’t see many stories with headlines
like “Ketchup may have mild relationship

00:06:13.819 --> 00:06:17.979
with weight gain in men over 40”cause who’s
going to read that?

00:06:17.980 --> 00:06:22.300
It might be accurate, but it’s just not
as flashy as “Is Ketchup making you fat!?”

00:06:22.300 --> 00:06:27.140
There are a number of reasons we get this
splashy headlines.Media outlets from Buzzfeed

00:06:27.140 --> 00:06:31.919
to Goop to the old-guard newspapers are all
fighting for audience these days--Maybe not

00:06:31.919 --> 00:06:33.789
exactly the same audience but audience.

00:06:33.789 --> 00:06:38.840
And that competition makes the super-sexy
headline, really, really appealing.

00:06:38.840 --> 00:06:40.880
Sensational gets clicks.

00:06:40.880 --> 00:06:45.340
Content creators are under pressure to find
and write what’s gonna get shared.

00:06:45.340 --> 00:06:50.120
The language of correlation is uncertain and,
as such, less catchy.

00:06:50.120 --> 00:06:53.930
You’ll also spot plenty of causation problems
in science and health reporting.

00:06:53.930 --> 00:06:58.600
When you see an article that claims that “doing
yoga cures cancer” you should check to see

00:06:58.600 --> 00:07:03.360
whether it was an experimental study or whether
the claim is based on correlation on a survey

00:07:03.360 --> 00:07:06.379
between doing yoga and not having cancer.

00:07:06.379 --> 00:07:10.539
Only experimental studies with randomized
designs and control groups have a shot at

00:07:10.539 --> 00:07:12.930
showing evidence of causation.

00:07:12.930 --> 00:07:18.280
Because personally, I can think of a lot of
confounding factors for yoga and cancer study.

00:07:18.280 --> 00:07:21.580
Nowon to another way science can get mischaracterized.

00:07:21.580 --> 00:07:26.499
There are studies done on mice and rats that
get reported as if they were studies on humans.

00:07:26.499 --> 00:07:31.439
And while a lot of medical and health related
studies get their start in mouse models many

00:07:31.439 --> 00:07:35.990
of the treatments that work in mice don’t
end up being successful in their human counterparts.

00:07:35.990 --> 00:07:42.289
Similarly, you will see clickbait-y headlines
that say “Hydrogen Peroxide kills cancer!”

00:07:42.289 --> 00:07:46.740
and lists all the ways you can now incorporate
H2O2 into your daily life.

00:07:46.740 --> 00:07:50.669
But what the title doesn’t tell you is that
these were in vitro studies, which means they’re

00:07:50.669 --> 00:07:54.050
done on real cancer cells but in a petri dish.

00:07:54.050 --> 00:07:58.199
In a very simplified sense-- the cells were
grown by themselves in a dish and the substance

00:07:58.199 --> 00:08:02.080
of interest was put into the dish and it killed
the cancer cells.

00:08:02.080 --> 00:08:08.180
But in a dish lots of things we consume everyday
will kill cancer cells like coffee, or alcohol.

00:08:08.180 --> 00:08:11.740
But they even working in tandem aren’t going
to cure cancer.

00:08:11.740 --> 00:08:16.460
Anyway these misguided “hydrogen peroxide
kills cancer” headlines get shared around

00:08:16.460 --> 00:08:20.550
online and people come up with alternative
therapies that involve consuming Hydrogen

00:08:20.550 --> 00:08:23.480
Peroxide which can be really, really dangerous.

00:08:23.480 --> 00:08:24.900
Like dead dangerous.

00:08:24.960 --> 00:08:27.260
Science stories can make for great journalism.

00:08:27.280 --> 00:08:30.449
And they can give you something clever to
say at your next dinner party.

00:08:30.449 --> 00:08:34.630
But any time you hear a cable talk show host
says the phrase “scientists have found...”

00:08:34.630 --> 00:08:38.640
or “a new study suggests…” you should
always just look up that study to be sure.

00:08:38.640 --> 00:08:40.790
At least before you start spreading it around.

00:08:40.790 --> 00:08:44.870
And if the results of a study will cause you
to make any changes in your life or your family’s

00:08:44.870 --> 00:08:47.430
life you should really go back and check the
science.

00:08:47.430 --> 00:08:52.360
No matter how reputable the source, it’s
always important to be aware of these issues,

00:08:52.360 --> 00:08:54.980
whether you see it in Buzzfeed or the Economist.

00:08:54.980 --> 00:08:59.520
Articles often gloss over all kinds of details. The kind of control group that was used, or whether

00:08:59.520 --> 00:09:03.900
the study was done in mice or monkeys, all
of which can make a huge difference in how

00:09:03.900 --> 00:09:06.060
strongly you can take the claims of the study.

00:09:06.060 --> 00:09:10.180
And the bigger the life change you are thinking
about making, the more in depth your search

00:09:10.180 --> 00:09:11.900
for information should be.

00:09:11.900 --> 00:09:15.820
Adding a square or two of dark chocolate to your diet is not going to be a big deal.

00:09:15.820 --> 00:09:21.100
Trying to cure cancer with high doses of Vitamin K just because some study found it kills

00:09:21.100 --> 00:09:23.550
cancer cells in a dish that is.

00:09:23.550 --> 00:09:27.320
So this doesn’t mean all the science you
read` about on Reddit or watch on your favorite

00:09:27.320 --> 00:09:29.210
YouTube channel is wrong.

00:09:29.210 --> 00:09:33.630
It just means that you need to use statistical
thinking to check which claims are reasonable

00:09:33.630 --> 00:09:34.620
and which aren’t.

00:09:34.620 --> 00:09:38.840
In order to help us remember some of the rules of thumb we talked about today, our writer

00:09:38.850 --> 00:09:43.020
Chelsea came up with a limerick: And so without further ado.

00:09:43.030 --> 00:09:45.720
Crash Course’s FIRST original limerick.

00:09:45.720 --> 00:09:51.100
When a study reports correlations
Or has mice as its main population

00:09:51.100 --> 00:09:55.080
The results it declares
May not be quite fair

00:09:55.080 --> 00:09:59.840
So be careful about generalizations

00:09:59.840 --> 00:10:02.100
Alright, let’s see you do better.

00:10:02.100 --> 00:10:04.100
Thanks for watching. I'll see you next time.
