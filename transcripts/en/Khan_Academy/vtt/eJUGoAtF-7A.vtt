00:00:00.500 --> 00:00:02.690
In the last video, we
saw that the quotient

00:00:02.690 --> 00:00:06.904
rule, which, once again, I have
mixed feelings about because it

00:00:06.904 --> 00:00:08.820
really comes straight
out of the product rule.

00:00:08.820 --> 00:00:11.484
If we have something in the
form f of x over g of x,

00:00:11.484 --> 00:00:12.900
then the derivative
of it could be

00:00:12.900 --> 00:00:14.730
this business right over here.

00:00:14.730 --> 00:00:16.840
So I thought I would at
least do one example where

00:00:16.840 --> 00:00:17.670
we can apply that.

00:00:17.670 --> 00:00:21.640
And can could do it to find the
derivative of something useful.

00:00:21.640 --> 00:00:24.609
So what's the
derivative with respect

00:00:24.609 --> 00:00:26.150
to x-- let me write
this a little bit

00:00:26.150 --> 00:00:32.356
neater-- the derivative with
respect to x of tangent of x?

00:00:32.356 --> 00:00:33.730
And you might say,
hey Sal, wait,

00:00:33.730 --> 00:00:35.120
I thought this was
about the quotient rule.

00:00:35.120 --> 00:00:36.578
But you just have
to remember, what

00:00:36.578 --> 00:00:39.370
is the definition
of the tangent of x?

00:00:39.370 --> 00:00:41.930
Or what is one way to
view the tangent of x?

00:00:41.930 --> 00:00:44.100
The tangent of x
is the same thing

00:00:44.100 --> 00:00:48.070
as sine of x-- let me
now color code it--

00:00:48.070 --> 00:00:56.860
is the same thing as sine
of x over cosine of x.

00:01:01.510 --> 00:01:07.800
And now it looks clear that
our expression is the ratio

00:01:07.800 --> 00:01:12.250
or it's one function
over another function.

00:01:12.250 --> 00:01:15.190
So now we can just
apply the quotient rule.

00:01:15.190 --> 00:01:17.160
So all of this
business is going to be

00:01:17.160 --> 00:01:21.020
equal to the derivative of
sine of x times cosine of x.

00:01:21.020 --> 00:01:23.420
So what's the
derivative of sine of x?

00:01:23.420 --> 00:01:25.200
Well, that's just cosine of x.

00:01:25.200 --> 00:01:28.440
So it's cosine of x is
derivative of sine of x times

00:01:28.440 --> 00:01:30.640
whatever function we
had in the denominator.

00:01:30.640 --> 00:01:37.886
So times cosine of
x minus whatever

00:01:37.886 --> 00:01:39.260
function we had
in the numerator,

00:01:39.260 --> 00:01:45.550
sine of x, times the
derivative of whatever we

00:01:45.550 --> 00:01:46.920
have in the denominator.

00:01:46.920 --> 00:01:50.010
Well what's the
derivative of cosine of x?

00:01:50.010 --> 00:01:53.860
Well the derivative of cosine
of x is negative sine of x.

00:01:53.860 --> 00:01:55.412
So we'll put the sine of x here.

00:01:55.412 --> 00:01:56.870
And it's a negative
so I could just

00:01:56.870 --> 00:01:59.150
make this right over
here a positive.

00:01:59.150 --> 00:02:03.120
And then all of
that over, whatever

00:02:03.120 --> 00:02:04.920
was in the denominator
squared, all

00:02:04.920 --> 00:02:11.570
of that over cosine
of x squared.

00:02:11.570 --> 00:02:13.580
Now what does this simplify to?

00:02:13.580 --> 00:02:15.280
Well in the numerator
right over here,

00:02:15.280 --> 00:02:17.940
we have cosine of x
times cosine of x.

00:02:17.940 --> 00:02:22.700
So all of this simplifies
to cosine squared of x.

00:02:22.700 --> 00:02:27.240
And sine of x times sine of x,
that's just sine squared of x.

00:02:27.240 --> 00:02:29.680
And what's cosine squared
of x plus sine squared of x?

00:02:29.680 --> 00:02:32.306
This is one of the most basic
trigonometric identities.

00:02:32.306 --> 00:02:34.430
It comes straight out of
the unit circle definition

00:02:34.430 --> 00:02:36.577
of trig functions.

00:02:36.577 --> 00:02:37.660
Let me write it over here.

00:02:37.660 --> 00:02:41.990
Cosine squared of
x plus sine squared

00:02:41.990 --> 00:02:47.500
of x is equal to 1, which
simplifies things quite nicely.

00:02:47.500 --> 00:02:50.750
So cosine squared of
x plus sine squared

00:02:50.750 --> 00:02:54.940
of x, all of this entire
numerator is equal to 1.

00:02:54.940 --> 00:03:03.460
So this nicely simplifies to
1 over cosine of x squared,

00:03:03.460 --> 00:03:06.110
which we could also write like
this, cosine squared of x.

00:03:06.110 --> 00:03:09.620
These are two ways of
writing cosine of x squared,

00:03:09.620 --> 00:03:15.630
which is the same exact thing
as 1 over cosine of x squared,

00:03:15.630 --> 00:03:18.010
which is the same
thing as secant.

00:03:18.010 --> 00:03:20.840
1 over cosine of x
is just secant of x.

00:03:20.840 --> 00:03:23.310
Secant of x squared, or we
could write it like this.

00:03:23.310 --> 00:03:25.654
Secant squared of x.

00:03:25.654 --> 00:03:27.070
And so that's where
it comes from.

00:03:27.070 --> 00:03:29.520
If you know that the
derivative of sine of x

00:03:29.520 --> 00:03:31.410
is cosine of x and the
derivative of cosine

00:03:31.410 --> 00:03:34.094
of x is negative sine of x,
we can use the quotient rule,

00:03:34.094 --> 00:03:36.260
which, once again, comes
straight out of the product

00:03:36.260 --> 00:03:38.260
rule to find the
derivative of tangent

00:03:38.260 --> 00:03:41.730
x is secant squared of x.
