00:00:02.980 --> 00:00:07.819
Well, look where we are now. With our backs
to the Sun, and the planets, asteroids, and

00:00:07.819 --> 00:00:13.499
comets behind us, we face deep space. There’s
nothing between us and the stars, so terribly

00:00:13.500 --> 00:00:15.280
terribly far away.

00:00:15.280 --> 00:00:16.580
… or is there?

00:00:27.420 --> 00:00:33.399
The empty space past Neptune isn’t exactly
empty. In episode 21 I mentioned that comets

00:00:33.399 --> 00:00:38.210
come in two varieties: Those with orbital
periods of less than 200 years, which tend

00:00:38.210 --> 00:00:42.190
to orbit the Sun in the same plane as the
planets, and those with longer periods, which

00:00:42.190 --> 00:00:44.010
have orbits tilted every which-way.

00:00:44.010 --> 00:00:48.140
This is something of a problem: Comets lose
material when they get near the Sun. Over

00:00:48.160 --> 00:00:53.460
the course of millions of years these comets
should evaporate! And yet here we are, 4.56

00:00:53.460 --> 00:00:57.760
billion years after the solar system’s birth,
and comets still appear in our skies.

00:00:57.760 --> 00:00:59.520
So, where are they coming from?

00:00:59.520 --> 00:01:04.880
To see, we’ll have to turn the clock back
a wee bit - like, 4.5 billion years.

00:01:04.880 --> 00:01:09.820
Behold, our forming solar system. Coalescing
out of a flat disk of material around the

00:01:09.820 --> 00:01:14.500
Sun, the inner planets were warmer, smaller,
and rocky, while the outer planets were in

00:01:14.500 --> 00:01:18.770
a region that was colder, and grew huge. Out
there in the chillier part of the solar system,

00:01:18.770 --> 00:01:23.590
water came in the form of ice mixed in with
dust and other stuff. These bits would collide

00:01:23.590 --> 00:01:28.049
and stick together, growing bigger. Some grew
to hundreds of kilometers across.

00:01:28.049 --> 00:01:33.150
But there was a problem: those outer planets.
They had a lot of gravity, and any chunk of

00:01:33.150 --> 00:01:37.710
ice getting too close would either fall into
the planet and get assimilated or get kicked

00:01:37.710 --> 00:01:42.760
into a different orbit. It could then plunge in toward
the Sun, or get flung out into deep space.

00:01:42.760 --> 00:01:47.159
Trillions upon trillions of such iceballs
got tossed around by the planets. Even though

00:01:47.159 --> 00:01:51.869
they were small compared to the planets, they
did have a little bit of mass and gravity,

00:01:51.869 --> 00:01:56.320
so every time the planet pulled hard on them,
they also pulled a little bit on the planets,

00:01:56.320 --> 00:02:01.399
too. It wasn’t much per chunk, but after
trillions of events this adds up! A current

00:02:01.399 --> 00:02:06.060
model of what happened, called the Nice model
after the city in France where it was proposed,

00:02:06.060 --> 00:02:10.640
says that the overall effect of all these
encounters was that Saturn, Uranus, and Neptune

00:02:10.640 --> 00:02:14.840
slowly moved outward from the Sun, while Jupiter
moved inward.

00:02:14.840 --> 00:02:18.400
Neptune would have had the biggest effect
on these iceballs, because it bordered the

00:02:18.400 --> 00:02:22.950
biggest volume of space where they lived.
As Neptune migrated outward, close encounters

00:02:22.950 --> 00:02:27.480
with these chunks of ice flung lots of them
into crazy orbits, highly elliptical and tilted

00:02:27.480 --> 00:02:32.470
with respect to the planets. Repeated more
distant encounters tended to more slowly increase

00:02:32.470 --> 00:02:34.870
the sizes of the orbits of the iceballs, too.

00:02:34.870 --> 00:02:38.790
We think that this shuffling around of the
outer planets is what caused the Late Heavy

00:02:38.790 --> 00:02:43.200
Bombardment, the intense shower of objects
that came screaming down from the outer solar

00:02:43.200 --> 00:02:48.150
system, scarring planets and moons, a few
hundred million years after the planets themselves

00:02:48.150 --> 00:02:52.209
formed. It’s not known for sure, but all
the pieces fit together really well.

00:02:52.209 --> 00:02:58.000
In the end, today, there are three rather distinct
populations of these objects. One is a region

00:02:58.000 --> 00:03:02.760
shaped like a puffy disk or a doughnut, aligned
with the plane of the planets. Icy objects

00:03:02.760 --> 00:03:07.430
there have stable orbits, unaffected by Neptune.
We call this the Kuiper Belt, named after

00:03:07.430 --> 00:03:11.909
the Dutch astronomer Gerard Kuiper, one of
many who initially speculated about the existence

00:03:11.909 --> 00:03:16.909
of this region. The Kuiper Belt starts more
or less just outside Neptune’s orbit, extending

00:03:16.909 --> 00:03:21.099
from about 4.5 to 7.5 billion kilometers from
the Sun.

00:03:21.099 --> 00:03:25.540
The second region is called the scattered
disk. This is composed of the iceballs sent

00:03:25.540 --> 00:03:30.180
by Neptune into those weird, highly tilted
orbits. This overlaps the Kuiper Belt on its

00:03:30.180 --> 00:03:35.640
inner edge, and extends out to perhaps 150
billion kilometers from the Sun—that’s

00:03:35.640 --> 00:03:38.239
25 times farther out than Neptune.

00:03:38.239 --> 00:03:43.549
Finally, outside those two zones there’s
a spherical cloud of icy objects which starts

00:03:43.549 --> 00:03:50.309
roughly 300 billion kilometers out— 70 times
farther out than Neptune, a staggering 2000

00:03:50.309 --> 00:03:54.700
times the distance of the Earth from the Sun.
And that’s just where it starts: It extends

00:03:54.709 --> 00:04:00.510
way farther out than that, perhaps as much
as a light year, 10 trillion kilometers! This

00:04:00.510 --> 00:04:04.540
is called the Oort Cloud, after astronomer
Jan Oort who first proposed it.

00:04:04.540 --> 00:04:09.150
The Oort Cloud is the origin of long period
comets. Since they orbit the Sun on a sphere

00:04:09.150 --> 00:04:13.129
with no preferred orientation, they come in
toward the inner solar system from random

00:04:13.129 --> 00:04:17.720
directions in the sky. Many newly discovered
comets fall into this category. Their orbits

00:04:17.720 --> 00:04:22.570
can be extremely long; they start their fall
from so far away they swing around the Sun

00:04:22.570 --> 00:04:26.530
at nearly escape velocity, and their orbits
are close to being parabolic.

00:04:26.530 --> 00:04:30.530
The scattered disk is the source of short
period comets. They can still be affected

00:04:30.530 --> 00:04:34.660
by Neptune, which can alter their orbits to
drop them down closer in. They can orbit the

00:04:34.660 --> 00:04:38.790
Sun on paths between Jupiter and Neptune,
meaning eventually they’ll have a close

00:04:38.790 --> 00:04:43.750
encounter with Jupiter. This can send them in closer
to the Sun, and they become short period comets.

00:04:43.750 --> 00:04:46.190
Tadaaa! That’s how comets are made.

00:04:46.190 --> 00:04:51.400
So how do we know all this? Well, until 1930
it was pretty much just conjecture. But then

00:04:51.400 --> 00:04:56.300
an American astronomer, Clyde Tombaugh, discovered
the first Kuiper Belt Object: Pluto.

00:04:56.300 --> 00:05:01.520
Pluto orbits the Sun on an elliptical, mildly-tilted
path. Its orbit actually brings it closer

00:05:01.530 --> 00:05:05.230
to the Sun than Neptune! So how come it never
collides with the larger planet?

00:05:05.230 --> 00:05:09.760
Pluto’s orbit crosses Neptune’s… more
or less. Because the orbit is tilted, they

00:05:09.770 --> 00:05:14.850
never actually physically cross. When Pluto
is at perihelion, closest to the Sun, it’s

00:05:14.850 --> 00:05:18.430
well above the plane of the solar system,
far from Neptune’s orbit.

00:05:18.430 --> 00:05:23.570
Not only that, but Pluto orbits the Sun twice
for every three times Neptune does. Because

00:05:23.570 --> 00:05:29.240
of this, whenever Pluto is closest to the
Sun, Neptune is always 90° away in its orbit.

00:05:29.240 --> 00:05:33.100
That’s many billions of kilometers distant,
way too far to affect Pluto.

00:05:33.100 --> 00:05:38.009
This is mostly coincidence. We’ve seen how
orbital resonances can be forced by tides

00:05:38.009 --> 00:05:42.860
and by gravity. But in this case it’s due
to attrition. Once upon a time, billions of

00:05:42.860 --> 00:05:48.040
years ago, there were probably a lot of objects out by
Pluto, with orbits of all different shapes and tilts.

00:05:48.040 --> 00:05:52.220
But the ones that got too close to Neptune
got gravitationally tweaked into different

00:05:52.220 --> 00:05:56.480
orbits, turning them into comets or flinging
them deeper into space. The only ones that

00:05:56.490 --> 00:06:02.259
could survive just happened to have orbits
with that 3:2 or 2:1 resonance with Neptune,

00:06:02.259 --> 00:06:06.620
keeping them far from Neptune’s influence.
Today, those are the only kinds of objects

00:06:06.620 --> 00:06:08.360
we see with orbits near Neptune.

00:06:08.360 --> 00:06:13.470
We call these objects plutinos. They’re
not really a separate class of object—they’re

00:06:13.470 --> 00:06:17.139
still Kuiper Belt objects, but a fun and interesting
subset of them.

00:06:17.139 --> 00:06:21.490
Once Pluto was found, astronomers wondered
if it might herald a new class of icy objects

00:06:21.490 --> 00:06:27.699
past Neptune. However, it took more than six
decades to find the next one! 1992 QB1 was

00:06:27.699 --> 00:06:32.740
discovered in 1992, and that opened a sort
of gold rush of Kuiper Belt discoveries. We

00:06:32.740 --> 00:06:37.850
now know of more than a thousand Kuiper Belt
Objects. One, called Eris, is very close to

00:06:37.850 --> 00:06:42.270
Pluto’s size and is more massive — it’s
probably rockier than icy Pluto.

00:06:42.270 --> 00:06:47.440
Pluto is an interesting object. A moon was
discovered in 1978. Named Charon, it’s actually

00:06:47.440 --> 00:06:52.840
about 1/8th the mass of Pluto itself! While
Charon orbits Pluto, the moon has enough mass

00:06:52.840 --> 00:06:57.660
that it can be said that Pluto noticeably
orbits Charon, too. In reality, both circle

00:06:57.660 --> 00:07:00.900
around their mutual center of mass, located
between the two.

00:07:00.900 --> 00:07:05.740
Four more moons were discovered in Hubble
images of Pluto in 2005 and 2012. There may

00:07:05.740 --> 00:07:12.040
be more. Pluto is so small and distant that we don't
know much about it… but that may be about to change.

00:07:12.040 --> 00:07:13.580
[sighs]

00:07:13.580 --> 00:07:18.420
And now I have to admit to being in a tough
spot. As I record this episode of Crash Course,

00:07:18.430 --> 00:07:23.190
a space probe called New Horizons is heading
toward Pluto. It will fly by the tiny world

00:07:23.190 --> 00:07:28.289
in July 2015. There’s no doubt our view
of Pluto will change: There may be more moons

00:07:28.289 --> 00:07:32.259
discovered, we’ll see surface features for
the first time, and much more. But right now

00:07:32.259 --> 00:07:36.580
I can’t tell you about any of that because
we don’t know yet. So I think the best thing

00:07:36.580 --> 00:07:39.060
to do is leave little Pluto alone for now.

00:07:39.060 --> 00:07:44.380
But there is a point I want to bring up. Pluto
was found in 1930, long before any other Kuiper

00:07:44.380 --> 00:07:48.470
Belt Object, because it’s much brighter
than any other. When it was discovered, it

00:07:48.470 --> 00:07:52.910
was thought to be about the size of Earth.
But over the years better observations showed

00:07:52.910 --> 00:07:57.550
it to be far smaller than first thought; in
fact it’s smaller than Earth’s Moon! Its

00:07:57.550 --> 00:08:02.740
surface is unusually reflective, shiny, making
it look much bigger than it seems. Most other

00:08:02.740 --> 00:08:06.440
Kuiper Belt denizens are far less reflective,
and so are far fainter.

00:08:06.440 --> 00:08:11.620
If Pluto is King of the Kuiper Belt Objects,
it has a lot of loyal subjects. We think the

00:08:11.620 --> 00:08:17.370
Kuiper Belt may have 100,000 objects in it
larger than 100 km wide. If that sounds like

00:08:17.370 --> 00:08:23.310
a lot, get this: The Oort Cloud, surrounding
the solar system, may have trillions of icy

00:08:23.310 --> 00:08:25.370
bodies in it. Trillions!

00:08:25.370 --> 00:08:29.220
While we know of lots of Kuiper Belt Objects,
we don’t know of any Oort Cloud objects

00:08:29.220 --> 00:08:35.310
for sure. Two very interesting bodies have
been found: Sedna, and VP113. Sedna’s orbit

00:08:35.310 --> 00:08:41.360
takes it an incredible 140 billion km from
the Sun, while VP113 gets about half that

00:08:41.360 --> 00:08:46.560
far out. Both are on very elliptical orbits.
Neither, however, gets close to Neptune, so

00:08:46.560 --> 00:08:51.029
it’s not at all clear how they got where
they are. They may be Oort Cloud objects that

00:08:51.029 --> 00:08:57.820
were disturbed by passing stars long ago, dropping
them closer into the Sun. But no one knows. Yet.

00:08:57.820 --> 00:09:02.180
Speaking of which… we can calculate how
many Oort Cloud objects there should be left

00:09:02.180 --> 00:09:07.300
over from the formation of the solar system,
and it’s about 6 billion. However, calculating

00:09:07.300 --> 00:09:12.820
how many there are using long period comet
observations, you wind up getting about 400

00:09:12.820 --> 00:09:18.740
billion. That’s a big discrepancy! Now get
this: One idea to solve this discrepancy is

00:09:18.740 --> 00:09:24.350
that the Sun has stolen comets from other
stars. Seriously! Comets should form wherever

00:09:24.350 --> 00:09:29.399
stars do, and sometimes the Sun passes near
other stars. When we see a long-period comet

00:09:29.399 --> 00:09:34.599
gracing our skies, could we be seeing an object
from an alien solar system? Maybe.

00:09:34.600 --> 00:09:39.440
There is another explanation, but it’s highly
speculative. Perhaps there’s another planet

00:09:39.450 --> 00:09:42.149
in the solar system, well beyond Neptune.

00:09:42.149 --> 00:09:47.130
It’s possible. Some very preliminary studies
have shown that some long-period comets aren’t

00:09:47.130 --> 00:09:51.690
coming in randomly, but instead have their
orbits aligned in a way you might expect if

00:09:51.690 --> 00:09:56.800
a very distant planet perturbed them. There are a
handful of Kuiper Belt Objects aligned in a similar way.

00:09:56.800 --> 00:10:00.880
NASA’s WISE observatory scanned the skies
in infrared, and would’ve seen anything

00:10:00.890 --> 00:10:05.649
as big as Jupiter or Saturn out to tremendous
distances, so any hypothetical planet would

00:10:05.649 --> 00:10:11.000
have to be smaller. And very distant, probably
tens of billions of kilometers out. We’ve

00:10:11.000 --> 00:10:14.860
seen other stars with planets this far out,
so it’s physically possible.

00:10:14.860 --> 00:10:20.100
But is there one really there? We can’t
say either way, yes or no. At least, not yet.

00:10:20.100 --> 00:10:24.680
This region of the solar system is seriously
underexplored. It’s distant, difficult to

00:10:24.680 --> 00:10:30.060
reach, and above all else extremely huge and
numbingly empty. You could hide a whole planet

00:10:30.060 --> 00:10:32.140
out there, and it would be pretty hard to
find.

00:10:32.140 --> 00:10:36.760
The point? There’s still lots of solar system
left to explore. We’ve barely dipped our

00:10:36.760 --> 00:10:39.280
toes into these dark, frigid waters.

00:10:39.280 --> 00:10:43.839
Today you learned that past Neptune are vast
reservoirs of icy bodies that can become comets

00:10:43.839 --> 00:10:48.649
if they get poked into the inner solar system.
The Kuiper Belt is a donut shape aligned with

00:10:48.649 --> 00:10:52.920
the plane of the solar system; the scattered
disk is more eccentric and is the source of

00:10:52.920 --> 00:10:58.120
short period comets; and the Oort Cloud which
surrounds the solar system out to great distances

00:10:58.120 --> 00:11:02.690
is the source of long-period comets. These
bodies all probably formed closer into the

00:11:02.690 --> 00:11:08.110
Sun, and got flung out to the solar system's suburbs
by gravitational interactions with the outer planets.
