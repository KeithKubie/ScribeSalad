00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.580
Hey it's me Destin, welcome back to Smarter Every Day.

00:00:02.580 --> 00:00:05.300
I have built a potato gun out of clear pipe

00:00:05.300 --> 00:00:08.260
which is amazing because you can see what's going on

00:00:08.260 --> 00:00:09.980
on the inside of the potato gun.

00:00:10.460 --> 00:00:11.760
Today's experiment is going to be pretty fun.

00:00:11.760 --> 00:00:14.760
Please excuse my scratchy voice but this is my only day off of work.

00:00:14.760 --> 00:00:16.940
This is my buddy. What are you going to do to help me?

00:00:16.940 --> 00:00:19.320
Uhmm, I'm going to trigger the high speed camera.

00:00:19.320 --> 00:00:21.380
Destin: Trigger the high speed camera. That's right.

00:00:21.380 --> 00:00:23.020
This is the high speed camera we are going to use

00:00:23.020 --> 00:00:24.940
to film at about 3000 fps.

00:00:24.940 --> 00:00:28.320
This is going to be a pretty big explosion so you are going to need that.

00:00:28.720 --> 00:00:35.360
We've got our potato ammunition, isobutane propellant (hairspray), watermelon and large squash.

00:00:35.360 --> 00:00:39.560
We're going to put a squash up here and we are going to hit it with a potato

00:00:39.560 --> 00:00:44.600
and see how much force we can transfer to that thing. You ready? Should be fun, let's give it a shot.

00:00:45.220 --> 00:00:50.780
Okay so the important thing when are putting a potato in a potato gun is you want a seal  all the way around the potato.

00:00:50.780 --> 00:00:54.140
There is a fancy word for that. It is called obturation.

00:00:54.180 --> 00:01:01.140
If you can get a complete obturation seal on the obturator you can get more compression and more velocity.

00:01:01.140 --> 00:01:04.080
So let's see how many Mississippi's we are going to put in here...

00:01:09.180 --> 00:01:10.920
3, 2, 1

00:01:11.980 --> 00:01:14.700
Alright let's see. Let's see if it worked.

00:01:23.740 --> 00:01:27.720
Broke just a little bit but we can do better than that can't we? Alright let's do it again!

00:01:27.720 --> 00:01:32.560
Okay that white part all the way around that's touching the barrel on the potato that's called the what?

00:01:33.200 --> 00:01:36.080
Obturator. And what does the obturator do?

00:01:36.500 --> 00:01:38.980
It makes the air not go past the bullet.

00:01:38.980 --> 00:01:42.360
Destin: That's right. It makes the explosion not go past the bullet.

00:01:45.160 --> 00:01:47.400
Ohhh that was a weak one wasn't it?

00:01:48.360 --> 00:01:49.640
We broke the squash.

00:01:49.640 --> 00:01:50.680
Destin: Did we?

00:01:50.680 --> 00:01:53.180
I think gravity did that more than the potato don't you?

00:01:54.100 --> 00:01:58.240
Let's go look at the high speed but I think the potato is breaking when it hits the squash

00:01:58.240 --> 00:02:01.160
so we might have to make a stronger potato on the front.

00:02:13.480 --> 00:02:17.820
Okay the potato is just shattering on impact. So clearly we need to fortify our potato.

00:02:17.820 --> 00:02:21.980
So I'm going to drill a hole in it here and put some metal on the front and see what that does.

00:02:36.260 --> 00:02:37.740
3, 2, 1

00:02:38.540 --> 00:02:39.820
I think that worked...

00:02:55.720 --> 00:02:57.400
Okay so the potato kept breaking, right?

00:02:57.400 --> 00:02:59.880
So we are going to use this. But it is made in a plastic case,

00:03:00.360 --> 00:03:02.680
so why can we use this in the barrel?

00:03:03.300 --> 00:03:05.300
Because it has the obturator.

00:03:05.300 --> 00:03:07.840
That's right. Good for you that's a big word for a little boy im proud of you.

00:03:08.440 --> 00:03:10.120
Okay let's go get it set up.

00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:13.400
You hear that seal? It's really good.

00:03:16.240 --> 00:03:18.260
It's really hard to do it because it's a really good seal.

00:03:18.260 --> 00:03:19.800
3, 2, 1

00:03:40.660 --> 00:03:44.980
Are you ready? 3, 2, 1, Go!

00:04:01.520 --> 00:04:03.880
Okay one quick thing I wanted to point out about the potato gun,

00:04:03.880 --> 00:04:06.280
it has to do with pressure, volume, and velocity.

00:04:06.560 --> 00:04:10.120
As the propellant ignites and pressure causes the potato to move down the barrel,

00:04:10.120 --> 00:04:12.980
when it does this the volume behind the potato expands.

00:04:12.980 --> 00:04:19.580
As the volume increases, if the burn rate doesn't keep up, sometimes the pressure can start to decrease.

00:04:19.580 --> 00:04:25.140
Different types of potato gun propellant  burn at different rates. Depending on the length of the barrel,

00:04:25.140 --> 00:04:30.300
if the volume expands to much, the pressure inside the chamber can actually dip below atmospheric pressure.

00:04:30.560 --> 00:04:35.200
The pressure can dip so low in fact that it can condense water vapor out of the air.

00:04:35.200 --> 00:04:39.800
I'm not 100% sure that's what is happening in this next clip but it's still awesome. Check it out.

00:04:57.580 --> 00:05:00.380
That is what you call backyard ballastics.

00:05:00.380 --> 00:05:05.020
I hope you enjoy this episode of Smarter Everyday. It was brought to you buy Audible.com.

00:05:05.020 --> 00:05:08.360
Before I tell you about the book I've been listening to I'm going to tell you about the next episode

00:05:08.660 --> 00:05:14.160
which is ridiculous. It's the same combustion chamber, transparent, at night, in slow motion,

00:05:14.160 --> 00:05:18.580
but I propagate that flame by initiating it at different points inside the combustion chamber.

00:05:19.240 --> 00:05:23.640
When I saw the slow-mo I just giggled like a lot. It's really a blast.

00:05:23.640 --> 00:05:29.580
That was bad, I'm so sorry. Anyway, if you want to see that episode go click that potato right over there.

00:05:29.580 --> 00:05:31.200
I think you will really enjoy it. Back to the sponsor.

00:05:31.200 --> 00:05:36.080
Audible.com sponsors Smarter Everyday and this is really easy to sell for me, this is not a challenge

00:05:36.080 --> 00:05:41.940
because Audible is my happy place. When I get on an airplane my favorite thing to do is to play a game on my phone

00:05:41.940 --> 00:05:48.520
and listen to an audio book. recently I'm listening to a Hitchhicker's Guide to the Galaxy the Restaurant at the End of the Universe.

00:05:48.520 --> 00:05:54.500
I really enjoy it. I've done this for years. I've listened to audio books on Audible.com well before they decided

00:05:54.500 --> 00:05:59.080
to start sponsoring Smarter Everyday. I listen to a bunch of books these are the ones I have physical copies of, whatever.

00:05:59.080 --> 00:06:03.720
It's you getting smarter. This is what you call a soft sell. I don't have to convince you, you're smart people,

00:06:03.720 --> 00:06:08.180
you know why going to audible.com/smarter would help Smarter Every Day. You also know that listening to

00:06:08.180 --> 00:06:12.960
audio books is smart. Anyway, that's it. There is plenty of stuff to click if you are interested in doing that.

00:06:12.960 --> 00:06:19.620
If you want to go click that potato and go giggle with me, feel free to do that. I'm Destin and you're getting smarter every day. Have a good one.

00:06:19.820 --> 00:06:24.380
What happen's if I start the ignition of the potato gun from the back?

00:06:24.380 --> 00:06:26.480
What happens if I start from the middle?

00:06:26.860 --> 00:06:34.620
(laughing)
