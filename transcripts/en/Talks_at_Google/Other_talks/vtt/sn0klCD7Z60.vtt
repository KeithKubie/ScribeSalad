00:00:00.975 --> 00:00:02.100
MARY GROVE: Good afternoon.

00:00:02.100 --> 00:00:03.830
How Is everyone today?

00:00:03.830 --> 00:00:04.610
AUDIENCE: Great.

00:00:04.610 --> 00:00:05.430
MARY GROVE: Great.

00:00:05.430 --> 00:00:07.300
My name is Mary Grove,
and I'm the Director

00:00:07.300 --> 00:00:08.810
of Google for Entrepreneurs.

00:00:08.810 --> 00:00:11.060
And we thank you
for joining us today

00:00:11.060 --> 00:00:13.700
for our special
fireside conversation.

00:00:13.700 --> 00:00:15.640
It is my pleasure to
introduce and welcome

00:00:15.640 --> 00:00:18.060
to Google Yoani Sanchez.

00:00:18.060 --> 00:00:20.030
Yoani is a Cuban
blogger and activist

00:00:20.030 --> 00:00:23.360
who has become a symbol
of global free expression.

00:00:23.360 --> 00:00:26.230
She was born in Havana,
Cuba, and studied in Cuba

00:00:26.230 --> 00:00:28.480
during the years when the
Soviet Union was supporting

00:00:28.480 --> 00:00:31.980
the island and its communist
revolution with tangible aid.

00:00:31.980 --> 00:00:35.190
And this also coincided with
the collapse of the Soviet Union

00:00:35.190 --> 00:00:37.270
and the loss of subsidies
that then comprised

00:00:37.270 --> 00:00:40.390
80% of Cuba's
international trade.

00:00:40.390 --> 00:00:42.850
Yoani has received
international acclaim

00:00:42.850 --> 00:00:44.480
for her critical
portrayal of life

00:00:44.480 --> 00:00:46.880
in Cuba under its
current government.

00:00:46.880 --> 00:00:50.190
She is best known for her
blog, "Generation Y," which

00:00:50.190 --> 00:00:52.250
is translated into 17 languages.

00:00:52.250 --> 00:00:56.560
And she boasts over half a
million followers on Twitter.

00:00:56.560 --> 00:00:59.100
"Time Magazine" named Yoani
one of the world's 100

00:00:59.100 --> 00:01:02.050
most influential people,
and President Barack Obama

00:01:02.050 --> 00:01:03.860
has applauded her
efforts to empower

00:01:03.860 --> 00:01:06.070
fellow Cubans to
express themselves

00:01:06.070 --> 00:01:08.240
through the use of technology.

00:01:08.240 --> 00:01:10.950
She has traveled throughout
South America and Europe

00:01:10.950 --> 00:01:13.180
and has lived in
Switzerland as well.

00:01:13.180 --> 00:01:15.070
Yoani has done
incredible work to break

00:01:15.070 --> 00:01:17.940
through the barriers of
access and get information out

00:01:17.940 --> 00:01:21.070
of Cuba and into the
global conversation.

00:01:21.070 --> 00:01:23.350
Last week, Yoani spoke at
the Google Ideas summit

00:01:23.350 --> 00:01:24.244
in New York City.

00:01:24.244 --> 00:01:26.660
And we are proud to welcome
her to the Google headquarters

00:01:26.660 --> 00:01:27.312
today.

00:01:27.312 --> 00:01:29.520
And just to set a little
bit of context for everybody

00:01:29.520 --> 00:01:33.740
today, thinking about technology
and access and free expression,

00:01:33.740 --> 00:01:37.620
Cuba's population is 11
million people, and only 2%

00:01:37.620 --> 00:01:40.070
of the country has
internet access.

00:01:40.070 --> 00:01:42.420
Yoani's ability to share
information from Cuba

00:01:42.420 --> 00:01:44.960
with the rest of the
world is remarkable,

00:01:44.960 --> 00:01:48.030
and it is all made possible
because of technology.

00:01:48.030 --> 00:01:51.310
She is what we call a blind
blogger or a blind tweeter,

00:01:51.310 --> 00:01:53.800
relying on SMS technology
to text information

00:01:53.800 --> 00:01:57.140
out and relying on her network
of citizens, what we call

00:01:57.140 --> 00:01:59.670
her citizen network
around the world, to post.

00:01:59.670 --> 00:02:02.330
And so she can't see the
responses, the comments,

00:02:02.330 --> 00:02:04.950
the conversation that's
happening in both directions.

00:02:04.950 --> 00:02:07.054
And it's pretty
remarkable and incredible.

00:02:07.054 --> 00:02:08.720
And we're delighted
to have her with us.

00:02:08.720 --> 00:02:10.340
Please join me in
welcoming Yoani Sanchez.

00:02:10.340 --> 00:02:10.940
[APPLAUSE]

00:02:10.940 --> 00:02:11.981
YOANI SANCHEZ: Thank you.

00:02:11.981 --> 00:02:13.760
Thank you, thank you.

00:02:16.944 --> 00:02:19.110
MARY GROVE: I also want to
welcome and thank Natalia

00:02:19.110 --> 00:02:23.380
from Roots of Hope for
being our translator today.

00:02:23.380 --> 00:02:24.660
So Yoani, welcome to Google.

00:02:24.660 --> 00:02:26.280
It's an honor to
have you with us.

00:02:26.280 --> 00:02:33.614
YOANI SANCHEZ:
[SPEAKING SPANISH]

00:02:33.614 --> 00:02:36.030
TRANSLATOR: I feel that today,
I am realizing many dreams.

00:02:36.030 --> 00:02:40.350
I don't want to pinch
myself in case I wake up.

00:02:40.350 --> 00:02:43.230
MARY GROVE: Tell us about your
experience growing up in Cuba.

00:02:43.230 --> 00:02:47.320
What were your high school
and university years like?

00:02:47.320 --> 00:02:54.000
TRANSLATOR: [SPEAKING SPANISH]

00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:58.819
YOANI SANCHEZ:
[SPEAKING SPANISH]

00:02:58.819 --> 00:03:00.360
TRANSLATOR: In
reality, my profession

00:03:00.360 --> 00:03:02.235
has absolutely nothing
to do with technology.

00:03:02.235 --> 00:03:13.570
YOANI SANCHEZ:
[SPEAKING SPANISH]

00:03:13.570 --> 00:03:16.260
TRANSLATOR: In some corner
of my house that I now cannot

00:03:16.260 --> 00:03:19.140
remember, there
is a certificate,

00:03:19.140 --> 00:03:21.960
a diploma that says
that I'm a philologist,

00:03:21.960 --> 00:03:24.150
studied Spanish
language and literature.

00:03:24.150 --> 00:03:32.417
YOANI SANCHEZ:
[SPEAKING SPANISH]

00:03:32.417 --> 00:03:34.500
TRANSLATOR: But in reality,
from a very young age,

00:03:34.500 --> 00:03:37.190
I was interested in all that
that had circuits and cables,

00:03:37.190 --> 00:03:39.880
and I was very intrigued
by house appliances

00:03:39.880 --> 00:03:41.929
and housewares.

00:03:41.929 --> 00:03:44.470
MARY GROVE: So you have always
loved technology, as you said.

00:03:44.470 --> 00:03:47.880
And it's my understanding that
you built your first computer

00:03:47.880 --> 00:03:50.280
in 1994 and called
it Frankenstein.

00:03:50.280 --> 00:03:52.685
Can you tell us about
how you created that

00:03:52.685 --> 00:03:54.810
and how you sourced the
parts for Frankenstein?

00:03:54.810 --> 00:03:59.590
YOANI SANCHEZ:
[SPEAKING SPANISH]

00:03:59.590 --> 00:04:02.710
TRANSLATOR: In 1994, I put
together my first computer.

00:04:02.710 --> 00:04:09.495
YOANI SANCHEZ:
[SPEAKING SPANISH]

00:04:09.495 --> 00:04:10.870
TRANSLATOR: At
that time in Cuba,

00:04:10.870 --> 00:04:13.180
almost no one had even
heard of what a computer was

00:04:13.180 --> 00:04:14.600
and definitely had not seen one.

00:04:14.600 --> 00:04:21.117
YOANI SANCHEZ:
[SPEAKING SPANISH]

00:04:21.117 --> 00:04:22.700
TRANSLATOR: But since
we are a country

00:04:22.700 --> 00:04:26.180
with a very robust illegal
market, a black market--

00:04:26.180 --> 00:04:30.970
YOANI SANCHEZ:
[SPEAKING SPANISH]

00:04:30.970 --> 00:04:34.030
TRANSLATOR: I began to purchase
and exchange parts and pieces

00:04:34.030 --> 00:04:35.350
to make my first Frankenstein.

00:04:35.350 --> 00:04:41.940
YOANI SANCHEZ:
[SPEAKING SPANISH]

00:04:41.940 --> 00:04:43.730
TRANSLATOR: I
remember that I had

00:04:43.730 --> 00:04:46.430
a machine for
depilating legs that

00:04:46.430 --> 00:04:49.640
used to be pretty painful that I
traded in for a microprocessor.

00:04:49.640 --> 00:04:59.750
YOANI SANCHEZ:
[SPEAKING SPANISH]

00:04:59.750 --> 00:05:02.220
TRANSLATOR: The model was a 286.

00:05:02.220 --> 00:05:08.150
YOANI SANCHEZ:
[SPEAKING SPANISH]

00:05:08.150 --> 00:05:10.630
TRANSLATOR: Again, I don't
know if I know this one.

00:05:10.630 --> 00:05:11.180
MS2--

00:05:11.180 --> 00:05:13.014
YOANI SANCHEZ:
[SPEAKING SPANISH]

00:05:13.014 --> 00:05:14.430
MARY GROVE: DOS,
like version 1.0.

00:05:14.430 --> 00:05:15.860
TRANSLATOR: Yeah,
DOS version 1.0.

00:05:15.860 --> 00:05:18.096
It's just hearing it in Spanish.

00:05:18.096 --> 00:05:18.596
Sorry.

00:05:18.596 --> 00:05:21.610
MARY GROVE: You have always
been such an entrepreneur,

00:05:21.610 --> 00:05:24.330
and it's an honor to have
you here at Google today.

00:05:24.330 --> 00:05:27.170
Our mission as a company is
to organize all the world's

00:05:27.170 --> 00:05:29.340
information and to
make it universally

00:05:29.340 --> 00:05:30.800
accessible and useful.

00:05:30.800 --> 00:05:34.580
And we think a lot about
this piece called access.

00:05:34.580 --> 00:05:38.510
Talk to us about the current
state of access in Cuba.

00:05:38.510 --> 00:05:46.481
YOANI SANCHEZ:
[SPEAKING SPANISH]

00:05:46.481 --> 00:05:48.730
TRANSLATOR: We Cubans live
in an island of disconnect.

00:05:48.730 --> 00:05:53.869
YOANI SANCHEZ:
[SPEAKING SPANISH]

00:05:53.869 --> 00:05:55.660
TRANSLATOR: And it's
not really a metaphor.

00:05:55.660 --> 00:05:58.020
It is that because we are
the country with the lowest

00:05:58.020 --> 00:06:00.040
internet penetration in
the Western hemisphere.

00:06:00.040 --> 00:06:06.860
YOANI SANCHEZ:
[SPEAKING SPANISH]

00:06:06.860 --> 00:06:08.860
TRANSLATOR: Official
figures say that around 15%

00:06:08.860 --> 00:06:11.470
of the population has access
to internet, but that's false.

00:06:11.470 --> 00:06:19.991
YOANI SANCHEZ:
[SPEAKING SPANISH]

00:06:19.991 --> 00:06:21.990
TRANSLATOR: The reality
is that within that 15%,

00:06:21.990 --> 00:06:25.530
there are many people who only
have access to an intranet

00:06:25.530 --> 00:06:27.270
or to email.

00:06:27.270 --> 00:06:35.710
YOANI SANCHEZ:
[SPEAKING SPANISH]

00:06:35.710 --> 00:06:37.280
TRANSLATOR: One
hour of connectivity

00:06:37.280 --> 00:06:40.570
in kind of a public
hotspot place

00:06:40.570 --> 00:06:43.990
costs $5 an hour
in a country where

00:06:43.990 --> 00:06:47.190
the average monthly salary
does not exceed $20.

00:06:47.190 --> 00:06:53.250
YOANI SANCHEZ:
[SPEAKING SPANISH]

00:06:53.250 --> 00:06:55.500
TRANSLATOR: It is not possible
for an ordinary citizen

00:06:55.500 --> 00:06:59.190
to go somewhere and take out
a home internet connection

00:06:59.190 --> 00:06:59.850
or land line.

00:06:59.850 --> 00:07:06.645
YOANI SANCHEZ:
[SPEAKING SPANISH]

00:07:06.645 --> 00:07:08.520
TRANSLATOR: You must
meet certain ideological

00:07:08.520 --> 00:07:10.970
prerequisites and be a
highly trustworthy person

00:07:10.970 --> 00:07:13.760
to even qualify for
internet access.

00:07:13.760 --> 00:07:23.539
Seen

00:07:23.539 --> 00:07:25.330
TRANSLATOR: Despite
all these restrictions,

00:07:25.330 --> 00:07:29.610
Cubans are very capable at
circumventing and finding

00:07:29.610 --> 00:07:32.260
ways around all that is
censured or prohibited.

00:07:32.260 --> 00:07:41.787
YOANI SANCHEZ:
[SPEAKING SPANISH]

00:07:41.787 --> 00:07:43.870
TRANSLATOR: So the same
as there is a black market

00:07:43.870 --> 00:07:46.830
to purchase eggs,
beef, or milk, there

00:07:46.830 --> 00:07:52.060
is a black market for the
acquisition of information,

00:07:52.060 --> 00:07:54.450
audiovisual files, and so on.

00:07:54.450 --> 00:07:56.340
MARY GROVE: So let's
talk about getting

00:07:56.340 --> 00:07:59.190
information, stories
from Cuba, out.

00:07:59.190 --> 00:08:01.250
How did you begin
blogging, and what

00:08:01.250 --> 00:08:03.696
was the real impetus for you?

00:08:03.696 --> 00:08:05.440
TRANSLATOR: [SPEAKING SPANISH]

00:08:05.440 --> 00:08:09.690
YOANI SANCHEZ:
[SPEAKING SPANISH]

00:08:09.690 --> 00:08:11.875
TRANSLATOR: I started
in April of 2007.

00:08:11.875 --> 00:08:20.717
YOANI SANCHEZ:
[SPEAKING SPANISH]

00:08:20.717 --> 00:08:22.300
TRANSLATOR: Several
years before that,

00:08:22.300 --> 00:08:25.310
I had started kind of a
collective communal project

00:08:25.310 --> 00:08:27.510
for the first ever
digital magazine in Cuba

00:08:27.510 --> 00:08:28.860
that was critical.

00:08:28.860 --> 00:08:33.490
YOANI SANCHEZ:
[SPEAKING SPANISH]

00:08:33.490 --> 00:08:36.150
TRANSLATOR: I had to learn in
a very autodidactic fashion

00:08:36.150 --> 00:08:37.480
to write in HTML.

00:08:37.480 --> 00:08:43.754
YOANI SANCHEZ:
[SPEAKING SPANISH]

00:08:43.754 --> 00:08:45.170
TRANSLATOR: And
at a certain time,

00:08:45.170 --> 00:08:48.040
I felt good about the
magazine, but I also

00:08:48.040 --> 00:08:49.720
wanted a space for
personal expression.

00:08:49.720 --> 00:08:58.590
YOANI SANCHEZ:
[SPEAKING SPANISH]

00:08:58.590 --> 00:09:03.520
TRANSLATOR: As such, I created
a very bare bones HTML page,

00:09:03.520 --> 00:09:05.220
and I uploaded it
to the internet

00:09:05.220 --> 00:09:07.250
under the title "Generation Y."

00:09:07.250 --> 00:09:15.040
YOANI SANCHEZ:
[SPEAKING SPANISH]

00:09:15.040 --> 00:09:16.540
TRANSLATOR: I was
unaware that there

00:09:16.540 --> 00:09:19.120
were services such as Blogger,
WordPress, or Typepad.

00:09:19.120 --> 00:09:25.810
YOANI SANCHEZ:
[SPEAKING SPANISH]

00:09:25.810 --> 00:09:27.310
TRANSLATOR: And so
every time that I

00:09:27.310 --> 00:09:29.600
wanted to update my
blog, I would completely

00:09:29.600 --> 00:09:32.230
take down the page and
then upload a new page.

00:09:32.230 --> 00:09:36.190
YOANI SANCHEZ:
[SPEAKING SPANISH]

00:09:36.190 --> 00:09:39.130
TRANSLATOR: And really, it's
a space for narrating reality.

00:09:39.130 --> 00:09:42.495
YOANI SANCHEZ:
[SPEAKING SPANISH]

00:09:42.495 --> 00:09:44.120
TRANSLATOR: The local
quotidian stories

00:09:44.120 --> 00:09:47.000
that the official
press does not mention.

00:09:47.000 --> 00:09:50.730
MARY GROVE: How were you
sourcing these stories?

00:09:50.730 --> 00:09:53.575
Who were they-- how
were you getting them?

00:09:53.575 --> 00:09:56.020
TRANSLATOR: [SPEAKING SPANISH]

00:09:56.020 --> 00:09:58.300
YOANI SANCHEZ:
[SPEAKING SPANISH]

00:09:58.300 --> 00:10:01.180
TRANSLATOR: I only recount
that which I have lived.

00:10:01.180 --> 00:10:08.950
YOANI SANCHEZ:
[SPEAKING SPANISH]

00:10:08.950 --> 00:10:14.150
TRANSLATOR: I attempt to
have every story on my blog

00:10:14.150 --> 00:10:17.030
be very linked to something
that has personally happened

00:10:17.030 --> 00:10:18.470
or that is related to me.

00:10:18.470 --> 00:10:22.685
YOANI SANCHEZ:
[SPEAKING SPANISH]

00:10:22.685 --> 00:10:24.830
TRANSLATOR: I am neither
an analyst or an academic

00:10:24.830 --> 00:10:26.720
or a specialist in
anything, really.

00:10:26.720 --> 00:10:38.070
YOANI SANCHEZ:
[SPEAKING SPANISH]

00:10:38.070 --> 00:10:40.570
TRANSLATOR: And I don't
like to view journalism

00:10:40.570 --> 00:10:44.690
as a researcher in a lab
coat, looking down at ants

00:10:44.690 --> 00:10:46.000
and recording their movements.

00:10:46.000 --> 00:10:50.310
YOANI SANCHEZ:
[SPEAKING SPANISH]

00:10:50.310 --> 00:10:51.685
TRANSLATOR: My
kind of journalism

00:10:51.685 --> 00:10:55.672
is the journalism of the
ant inside the ant hill.

00:10:55.672 --> 00:10:57.520
MARY GROVE: Wonderful analogy.

00:10:57.520 --> 00:11:01.940
So you, it's taken a tremendous
amount of courage and bravery

00:11:01.940 --> 00:11:03.630
to put these stories out there.

00:11:03.630 --> 00:11:05.950
I know you've received
numerous threats

00:11:05.950 --> 00:11:07.560
and been in danger
several times.

00:11:07.560 --> 00:11:08.720
Talk to us.

00:11:08.720 --> 00:11:11.540
What's the scariest thing
that's happened to you?

00:11:11.540 --> 00:11:17.980
YOANI SANCHEZ:
[SPEAKING SPANISH]

00:11:17.980 --> 00:11:20.320
TRANSLATOR: I have had very
difficult times and moments

00:11:20.320 --> 00:11:21.950
in the six years of
writing the blog.

00:11:21.950 --> 00:11:24.020
YOANI SANCHEZ:
[SPEAKING SPANISH]

00:11:24.020 --> 00:11:26.060
TRANSLATOR: I have also
had very beautiful ones.

00:11:26.060 --> 00:11:33.657
YOANI SANCHEZ:
[SPEAKING SPANISH]

00:11:33.657 --> 00:11:35.490
TRANSLATOR: One of the
most complicated ones

00:11:35.490 --> 00:11:37.680
was my first arrest.

00:11:37.680 --> 00:11:41.935
YOANI SANCHEZ:
[SPEAKING SPANISH]

00:11:41.935 --> 00:11:43.990
TRANSLATOR: And it
is a story of pain,

00:11:43.990 --> 00:11:45.700
but it is also a story
about technology.

00:11:45.700 --> 00:11:50.174
YOANI SANCHEZ:
[SPEAKING SPANISH]

00:11:50.174 --> 00:11:52.090
TRANSLATOR: And the
importance that technology

00:11:52.090 --> 00:11:53.980
has in the protection
of Cuban activists.

00:11:53.980 --> 00:11:57.400
YOANI SANCHEZ:
[SPEAKING SPANISH]

00:11:57.400 --> 00:12:00.600
TRANSLATOR: It was on
November 6 of 2009.

00:12:00.600 --> 00:12:06.506
YOANI SANCHEZ:
[SPEAKING SPANISH]

00:12:06.506 --> 00:12:07.880
TRANSLATOR: With
several friends,

00:12:07.880 --> 00:12:12.120
we were going to participate in
an alternative peaceful protest

00:12:12.120 --> 00:12:13.270
against violence.

00:12:13.270 --> 00:12:29.960
YOANI SANCHEZ:
[SPEAKING SPANISH]

00:12:29.960 --> 00:12:35.730
TRANSLATOR: So, as a tangent,
Cubans send Twitter, or tweet,

00:12:35.730 --> 00:12:38.150
using SMS messages
from their phones.

00:12:38.150 --> 00:12:42.660
So we were getting ready
to leave, one of my friends

00:12:42.660 --> 00:12:45.050
noticed some tension
in the surrounding

00:12:45.050 --> 00:12:46.070
area due to the protest.

00:12:46.070 --> 00:12:47.530
And so she said
that she was going

00:12:47.530 --> 00:12:49.595
to write a tweet in her drafts.

00:12:49.595 --> 00:12:54.649
YOANI SANCHEZ:
[SPEAKING SPANISH]

00:12:54.649 --> 00:12:56.440
TRANSLATOR: And so she
wrote, just in case,

00:12:56.440 --> 00:12:58.350
a message that she saved
in her drafts that said,

00:12:58.350 --> 00:12:59.250
we've been detained.

00:12:59.250 --> 00:13:02.430
YOANI SANCHEZ:
[SPEAKING SPANISH]

00:13:02.430 --> 00:13:04.610
TRANSLATOR: And I remember
thinking and saying

00:13:04.610 --> 00:13:06.460
that that augurs bad luck.

00:13:06.460 --> 00:13:16.370
YOANI SANCHEZ:
[SPEAKING SPANISH]

00:13:16.370 --> 00:13:18.660
TRANSLATOR: And sure
enough, on our way there,

00:13:18.660 --> 00:13:22.640
a police car pulled us
over and forced two of us

00:13:22.640 --> 00:13:23.780
into the backseat.

00:13:23.780 --> 00:13:29.460
YOANI SANCHEZ:
[SPEAKING SPANISH]

00:13:29.460 --> 00:13:31.170
TRANSLATOR: They
turned me upside down,

00:13:31.170 --> 00:13:33.740
and there was a
very strong man that

00:13:33.740 --> 00:13:35.250
placed his knee on my chest.

00:13:35.250 --> 00:13:37.089
YOANI SANCHEZ:
[SPEAKING SPANISH]

00:13:37.089 --> 00:13:39.380
TRANSLATOR: And the car
started to move through Havana.

00:13:39.380 --> 00:13:47.700
YOANI SANCHEZ:
[SPEAKING SPANISH]

00:13:47.700 --> 00:13:51.430
TRANSLATOR: And at a certain
point, the driver of the car

00:13:51.430 --> 00:13:55.590
picked up a phone call, spoke
briefly, and turned to the man

00:13:55.590 --> 00:13:56.710
in the backseat.

00:13:56.710 --> 00:13:59.300
YOANI SANCHEZ:
[SPEAKING SPANISH]

00:13:59.300 --> 00:14:01.430
TRANSLATOR: And said,
don't press her too much,

00:14:01.430 --> 00:14:03.000
because they already know.

00:14:03.000 --> 00:14:19.144
YOANI SANCHEZ:
[SPEAKING SPANISH]

00:14:19.144 --> 00:14:20.560
TRANSLATOR: At
that moment, I felt

00:14:20.560 --> 00:14:22.060
that the little
blue bird of Twitter

00:14:22.060 --> 00:14:24.790
had come to save me because the
tweet that my friend had been

00:14:24.790 --> 00:14:27.330
able to send out had
gone and returned

00:14:27.330 --> 00:14:32.180
in the form of protection
via the virtual response that

00:14:32.180 --> 00:14:33.230
had come to her tweet.

00:14:33.230 --> 00:14:36.550
YOANI SANCHEZ:
[SPEAKING SPANISH]

00:14:36.550 --> 00:14:38.050
TRANSLATOR: For
this reason as well,

00:14:38.050 --> 00:14:39.633
I am very passionate
about technology.

00:14:39.633 --> 00:14:40.610
MARY GROVE: Incredible.

00:14:40.610 --> 00:14:42.920
Really incredible.

00:14:42.920 --> 00:14:45.240
You are such a vital
voice representing

00:14:45.240 --> 00:14:47.249
so many generations of Cubans.

00:14:47.249 --> 00:14:48.790
What messages would
you like to share

00:14:48.790 --> 00:14:51.750
with our community
about the Cuban people?

00:14:51.750 --> 00:15:00.485
YOANI SANCHEZ:
[SPEAKING SPANISH]

00:15:00.485 --> 00:15:03.440
TRANSLATOR: The message that I
would like to transmit today,

00:15:03.440 --> 00:15:05.970
now that I'm here at the
Mecca of technology--

00:15:05.970 --> 00:15:10.630
YOANI SANCHEZ:
[SPEAKING SPANISH]

00:15:10.630 --> 00:15:14.140
TRANSLATOR: --is that we Cubans
would like to feel ourselves

00:15:14.140 --> 00:15:16.770
as citizens of the 21st century.

00:15:16.770 --> 00:15:26.350
YOANI SANCHEZ:
[SPEAKING SPANISH]

00:15:26.350 --> 00:15:28.210
TRANSLATOR: And not
only in the sense

00:15:28.210 --> 00:15:31.640
of freedom or self-expression,
but also in terms of access

00:15:31.640 --> 00:15:32.600
to technology.

00:15:32.600 --> 00:15:36.490
YOANI SANCHEZ:
[SPEAKING SPANISH]

00:15:36.490 --> 00:15:40.100
TRANSLATOR: Cubans have a
robust appetite for technology.

00:15:40.100 --> 00:15:52.270
YOANI SANCHEZ:
[SPEAKING SPANISH]

00:15:52.270 --> 00:15:54.610
TRANSLATOR: Sometimes, people
will be crammed into a car

00:15:54.610 --> 00:15:56.484
from the '50s,
while falling apart

00:15:56.484 --> 00:15:58.650
and [? racketing ?] along
in Havana, and a cellphone

00:15:58.650 --> 00:15:59.340
will ring.

00:15:59.340 --> 00:16:04.920
YOANI SANCHEZ:
[SPEAKING SPANISH]

00:16:04.920 --> 00:16:07.630
TRANSLATOR: And when the
person takes out their phone

00:16:07.630 --> 00:16:09.860
from their pocket, it's
a Samsung Galaxy S3.

00:16:09.860 --> 00:16:18.750
YOANI SANCHEZ:
[SPEAKING SPANISH]

00:16:18.750 --> 00:16:21.740
TRANSLATOR: Because Cubans
have such a desire to associate

00:16:21.740 --> 00:16:24.500
themselves as men and
women of the 21st century,

00:16:24.500 --> 00:16:26.430
they really thirst
for technology.

00:16:26.430 --> 00:16:29.850
YOANI SANCHEZ:
[SPEAKING SPANISH]

00:16:29.850 --> 00:16:31.350
TRANSLATOR: And as
such, please help

00:16:31.350 --> 00:16:33.739
us be citizens of
the 21st century.

00:16:33.739 --> 00:16:36.280
MARY GROVE: You could trade that
Samsung for the Frankenstein

00:16:36.280 --> 00:16:38.410
parts.

00:16:38.410 --> 00:16:41.280
So here within the room,
we have many, many Googlers

00:16:41.280 --> 00:16:43.030
who are passionate
about learning

00:16:43.030 --> 00:16:46.790
how they can help and be a
part of the journey forward.

00:16:46.790 --> 00:16:48.740
So what would you like
to see from Google,

00:16:48.740 --> 00:16:51.240
or how can people in this room
who are interested in getting

00:16:51.240 --> 00:16:52.970
involved?

00:16:52.970 --> 00:17:26.294
YOANI SANCHEZ:
[SPEAKING SPANISH]

00:17:26.294 --> 00:17:28.460
TRANSLATOR: I would say
there are many ways to help.

00:17:28.460 --> 00:17:31.790
One important
thing to realize is

00:17:31.790 --> 00:17:35.090
that the official
narrative in Cuba

00:17:35.090 --> 00:17:36.975
has many avenues
for dissemination

00:17:36.975 --> 00:17:40.020
and for propaganda,
but the voices

00:17:40.020 --> 00:17:43.090
of dissent and opposition
and free thinkers in Cuba

00:17:43.090 --> 00:17:46.710
have very few and limited
avenues for dissemination.

00:17:46.710 --> 00:17:53.982
YOANI SANCHEZ:
[SPEAKING SPANISH]

00:17:53.982 --> 00:17:55.440
TRANSLATOR: And so
it would be very

00:17:55.440 --> 00:17:59.030
helpful to assist
that small group that

00:17:59.030 --> 00:18:04.110
dares to opine differently
in amplifying their voices.

00:18:04.110 --> 00:18:13.994
YOANI SANCHEZ:
[SPEAKING SPANISH]

00:18:13.994 --> 00:18:15.410
TRANSLATOR: We
need tools that are

00:18:15.410 --> 00:18:19.390
very specific to the
Cuban circumstances, which

00:18:19.390 --> 00:18:22.100
is difficult for other people
to understand because it

00:18:22.100 --> 00:18:23.770
is like time traveling back.

00:18:23.770 --> 00:18:35.740
YOANI SANCHEZ:
[SPEAKING SPANISH]

00:18:35.740 --> 00:18:38.500
TRANSLATOR: Any tool that
allows for the downloading

00:18:38.500 --> 00:18:40.606
and processing of
information offline

00:18:40.606 --> 00:18:44.440
or that allows-- that interacts
with USB drives or flash

00:18:44.440 --> 00:18:48.810
drives, on or off information,
are transcendental in Cuba.

00:18:48.810 --> 00:18:52.520
YOANI SANCHEZ:
[SPEAKING SPANISH]

00:18:52.520 --> 00:18:55.420
TRANSLATOR: I would love to see
a mobile or portable version

00:18:55.420 --> 00:18:56.185
of Chrome.

00:18:56.185 --> 00:18:58.030
Not mobile, portable.

00:18:58.030 --> 00:19:00.782
MARY GROVE: So what are some
of your favorite products,

00:19:00.782 --> 00:19:01.990

YOANI SANCHEZ:
[SPEAKING SPANISH]

00:19:20.236 --> 00:19:22.860
TRANSLATOR: I won't show you the
collection of apps that I have

00:19:22.860 --> 00:19:24.660
because it's too much.

00:19:24.660 --> 00:19:35.670
YOANI SANCHEZ:
[SPEAKING SPANISH]

00:19:35.670 --> 00:19:38.690
TRANSLATOR: But I try to
concentrate all my effort

00:19:38.690 --> 00:19:40.160
usually in one gadget.

00:19:40.160 --> 00:19:52.660
YOANI SANCHEZ:
[SPEAKING SPANISH]

00:19:52.660 --> 00:19:54.410
TRANSLATOR: It's also
a matter of survival

00:19:54.410 --> 00:19:56.410
because if the
police come to raid,

00:19:56.410 --> 00:20:00.040
and I have a phone, a camera,
a laptop, a USB drive,

00:20:00.040 --> 00:20:02.650
there are more items for them
to take and more items for me

00:20:02.650 --> 00:20:03.370
to protect.

YOANI SANCHEZ:
[SPEAKING SPANISH]

00:20:15.020 --> 00:20:18.030
TRANSLATOR: As such, I
use smartphones a lot

00:20:18.030 --> 00:20:22.800
because they allow me to record,
write, take photos, and do

00:20:22.800 --> 00:20:24.240
a lot of other things.

00:20:24.240 --> 00:20:29.100

with Android.

YOANI SANCHEZ:
[SPEAKING SPANISH]

00:20:34.364 --> 00:20:36.905
TRANSLATOR: But at the moment,
I have in my pocket an iPhone.

00:20:40.280 --> 00:20:41.390
So I'm very curious.

00:20:41.390 --> 00:20:44.390
You talk about this concept
of the citizen network

00:20:44.390 --> 00:20:46.230
and all of the global
community around you

00:20:46.230 --> 00:20:48.410
who was helping disseminate
this information.

00:20:48.410 --> 00:20:51.760
How have you built
that network over time?

says that my blog has so much

traction and following
because the CIA has

00:21:15.280 --> 00:21:17.770
built my blog and my persona.

YOANI SANCHEZ:

is a much more powerful
force, friendship.

YOANI SANCHEZ:
[SPEAKING SPANISH]

00:21:28.910 --> 00:21:31.470

00:21:40.930 --> 00:21:43.660
what people are
willing to do or help

00:21:43.660 --> 00:21:47.360
with when your narrative
and your story touches them.

00:21:47.360 --> 00:21:56.785
YOANI SANCHEZ:
[SPEAKING SPANISH]

00:21:56.785 --> 00:21:58.160
TRANSLATOR: And
here's an example

00:21:58.160 --> 00:22:02.740
is Mary Jo Porter, who is my
translator, the translator

00:22:02.740 --> 00:22:04.240
of my blog into
English, and also

00:22:04.240 --> 00:22:07.980
the person who organizes
a network of translators

00:22:07.980 --> 00:22:09.700
for other Cuban blogs.

00:22:09.700 --> 00:22:18.469
YOANI SANCHEZ:
[SPEAKING SPANISH]

00:22:18.469 --> 00:22:20.260
TRANSLATOR: And so
there are many examples.

00:22:20.260 --> 00:22:25.210
These earrings, which
have the logo of my blog,

00:22:25.210 --> 00:22:28.510
"Generation Y," were made
for me by a reader from Peru.

00:22:28.510 --> 00:22:35.150
YOANI SANCHEZ:
[SPEAKING SPANISH]

00:22:35.150 --> 00:22:37.930
TRANSLATOR: And one day,
in Twitter via message,

00:22:37.930 --> 00:22:40.320
I explained that I had
a respiratory problem.

00:22:40.320 --> 00:22:50.390
YOANI SANCHEZ:
[SPEAKING SPANISH]

00:22:50.390 --> 00:22:52.160
TRANSLATOR: And
several weeks later, I

00:22:52.160 --> 00:22:53.951
heard a knock on my
door, and it was a girl

00:22:53.951 --> 00:22:57.030
from Barcelona who said,
Yoani, I brought you

00:22:57.030 --> 00:23:00.610
a machine for inhalating,
like an inhalation machine.

00:23:00.610 --> 00:23:03.230
MARY GROVE: Friends
all over the world.

00:23:03.230 --> 00:23:06.280
So I'd love to shift gears a
bit and think about the future.

00:23:06.280 --> 00:23:09.180
So you're currently
working on a new project.

00:23:09.180 --> 00:23:10.420
Tell us about it.

00:23:10.420 --> 00:23:23.514
YOANI SANCHEZ:
[SPEAKING SPANISH]

00:23:23.514 --> 00:23:24.930
TRANSLATOR: I have
a motto in life

00:23:24.930 --> 00:23:27.730
that I was sharing earlier
today with Roberta Jacobson that

00:23:27.730 --> 00:23:32.320
is, I prefer to be
stressed rather than bored.

00:23:32.320 --> 00:23:39.395
YOANI SANCHEZ:
[SPEAKING SPANISH]

00:23:39.395 --> 00:23:41.770
TRANSLATOR: As such, I always
like to have many projects.

00:23:41.770 --> 00:23:43.650
I believe that life is
about having projects.

00:23:43.650 --> 00:23:47.275
YOANI SANCHEZ:
[SPEAKING SPANISH]

00:23:47.275 --> 00:23:48.650
TRANSLATOR: At
the moment, I have

00:23:48.650 --> 00:23:51.845
a project that is journalistic
and deals with information.

00:23:51.845 --> 00:23:53.650
And it is a collective project.

00:23:53.650 --> 00:24:01.165
YOANI SANCHEZ:
[SPEAKING SPANISH]

00:24:01.165 --> 00:24:04.210
TRANSLATOR: It is a project
to create a digital newspaper

00:24:04.210 --> 00:24:07.180
from Cuba, which is
quite a challenge

00:24:07.180 --> 00:24:08.460
due to the lack of access.

00:24:08.460 --> 00:24:17.990
YOANI SANCHEZ:
[SPEAKING SPANISH] I

00:24:17.990 --> 00:24:20.760
TRANSLATOR: It is a place
for opinions and information,

00:24:20.760 --> 00:24:25.160
but also a sphere for
practicing democracy 2.0.

00:24:25.160 --> 00:24:32.034
YOANI SANCHEZ:
[SPEAKING SPANISH]

00:24:32.034 --> 00:24:33.950
TRANSLATOR: Where people
can exchange opinions

00:24:33.950 --> 00:24:37.350
about the dual currency
in Cuba or the death

00:24:37.350 --> 00:24:38.990
penalty, gay marriage.

00:24:38.990 --> 00:24:43.260
YOANI SANCHEZ:
[SPEAKING SPANISH]

00:24:43.260 --> 00:24:46.010
TRANSLATOR: But also a newspaper
to read about technology.

00:24:46.010 --> 00:24:49.380
MARY GROVE: How is the digital
journalism landscape in Cuba

00:24:49.380 --> 00:24:51.230
shifting at all right now?

00:24:51.230 --> 00:25:04.550
YOANI SANCHEZ:
[SPEAKING SPANISH]

00:25:04.550 --> 00:25:07.200
TRANSLATOR: After
the arrival of blogs

00:25:07.200 --> 00:25:09.206
and Twitter to the
national stage,

00:25:09.206 --> 00:25:11.080
independent journalism
has certainly changed,

00:25:11.080 --> 00:25:13.310
but even official journalism
has had to change.

00:25:13.310 --> 00:25:20.785
YOANI SANCHEZ:
[SPEAKING SPANISH]

00:25:20.785 --> 00:25:22.410
TRANSLATOR: For
example, the government

00:25:22.410 --> 00:25:26.160
has realized that it can
no longer occult and hide

00:25:26.160 --> 00:25:28.680
certain events that
happen in reality.

00:25:28.680 --> 00:25:37.179
YOANI SANCHEZ:
[SPEAKING SPANISH]

00:25:37.179 --> 00:25:38.970
TRANSLATOR: As such,
the official narrative

00:25:38.970 --> 00:25:42.920
has to broach subjects that
years ago it never would have.

00:25:42.920 --> 00:25:48.032
YOANI SANCHEZ:
[SPEAKING SPANISH]

00:25:48.032 --> 00:25:49.990
TRANSLATOR: In addition,
independent journalism

00:25:49.990 --> 00:25:53.020
has also achieved
greater immediacy.

00:25:53.020 --> 00:26:06.120
YOANI SANCHEZ:
[SPEAKING SPANISH]

00:26:06.120 --> 00:26:09.340
TRANSLATOR: Before, if there had
been an arrest or other event,

00:26:09.340 --> 00:26:13.030
independent journalists had
to wait for calls from abroad

00:26:13.030 --> 00:26:15.460
to [INAUDIBLE] confirm that
something had happened.

00:26:15.460 --> 00:26:25.550
YOANI SANCHEZ:
[SPEAKING SPANISH]

00:26:25.550 --> 00:26:28.030
TRANSLATOR: Now, with a cell
phone in hand and no internet,

00:26:28.030 --> 00:26:30.710
any ordinary citizen
from anywhere in Cuba

00:26:30.710 --> 00:26:33.560
can send a piece of news out.

00:26:33.560 --> 00:26:40.610
YOANI SANCHEZ:
[SPEAKING SPANISH]

00:26:40.610 --> 00:26:44.040
TRANSLATOR: I will give
you a technological trick.

00:26:44.040 --> 00:26:56.500
YOANI SANCHEZ:
[SPEAKING SPANISH]

00:26:56.500 --> 00:26:59.600
TRANSLATOR: Whenever you are
in a place that lacks internet,

00:26:59.600 --> 00:27:02.760
whether because you're in
a highly censored place,

00:27:02.760 --> 00:27:05.150
or a natural disaster
has occurred,

00:27:05.150 --> 00:27:06.860
or you simply
don't have signal--

00:27:06.860 --> 00:27:14.570
YOANI SANCHEZ:
[SPEAKING SPANISH]

00:27:14.570 --> 00:27:17.100
TRANSLATOR: It's good to
know that social networks

00:27:17.100 --> 00:27:20.670
such as Twitter allow for
publication on their medium

00:27:20.670 --> 00:27:22.120
through text message.

00:27:22.120 --> 00:27:27.805
YOANI SANCHEZ:
[SPEAKING SPANISH]

00:27:27.805 --> 00:27:28.930
TRANSLATOR: It's very easy.

00:27:28.930 --> 00:27:31.690
All you have to do is
take the service number,

00:27:31.690 --> 00:27:33.420
a particular service
number for Twitter,

00:27:33.420 --> 00:27:35.160
and send four commands.

00:27:35.160 --> 00:27:38.910
YOANI SANCHEZ:
[SPEAKING SPANISH]

00:27:38.910 --> 00:27:41.080
TRANSLATOR: Start, yes,
username, and password.

00:27:41.080 --> 00:27:45.785
YOANI SANCHEZ:
[SPEAKING SPANISH]

00:27:45.785 --> 00:27:47.160
TRANSLATOR: And
your phone number

00:27:47.160 --> 00:27:49.370
will then be linked
to Twitter, and you

00:27:49.370 --> 00:27:50.990
can tweet without internet.

00:27:50.990 --> 00:27:54.560
YOANI SANCHEZ:
[SPEAKING SPANISH]

00:27:54.560 --> 00:27:56.560
TRANSLATOR: I hope that
someday Google will also

00:27:56.560 --> 00:27:58.380
make such a tool for us.

00:27:58.380 --> 00:28:01.755
[LAUGHTER]

00:28:01.755 --> 00:28:03.880
MARY GROVE: There is,
actually, we do a lot of work

00:28:03.880 --> 00:28:05.629
in emerging markets,
focusing on how do we

00:28:05.629 --> 00:28:06.990
bring the next 4 billion online.

00:28:06.990 --> 00:28:10.672
And it's all about mobile, using
SMS gateways, and absolutely.

00:28:10.672 --> 00:28:14.620
We launched a tool called Google
Trader across Africa, which

00:28:14.620 --> 00:28:17.165
is allowing transaction
of prices and currencies,

00:28:17.165 --> 00:28:19.320
or that sharing of
information via mobile.

00:28:19.320 --> 00:28:21.880
So absolutely, I think
that's very, very much

00:28:21.880 --> 00:28:23.640
a huge part of the future.

00:28:23.640 --> 00:28:25.960
And so I want to
shift gears to talk

00:28:25.960 --> 00:28:27.460
a little bit about
entrepreneurship.

00:28:27.460 --> 00:28:30.000
And in my work with
Google for entrepreneurs,

00:28:30.000 --> 00:28:33.870
our mission is to empower the
next generation of startups.

00:28:33.870 --> 00:28:36.810
We work with entrepreneurs
in over 125 countries.

00:28:36.810 --> 00:28:41.030
What advice do you have for
aspiring entrepreneurs looking

00:28:41.030 --> 00:28:41.840
to break through?

00:28:41.840 --> 00:28:45.390
We have this notion that
constrained resources breeds

00:28:45.390 --> 00:28:46.400
a lot of creativity.

00:28:46.400 --> 00:28:47.900
What's your advice
for entrepreneurs

00:28:47.900 --> 00:28:50.170
looking to get started?

00:28:50.170 --> 00:29:01.117
YOANI SANCHEZ:
[SPEAKING SPANISH]

00:29:01.117 --> 00:29:03.700
TRANSLATOR: Just a few days ago,
when I spoke at Google Ideas,

00:29:03.700 --> 00:29:07.420
I said that creativity is having
the possibility of opening

00:29:07.420 --> 00:29:09.310
a window when the
door is closed.

00:29:09.310 --> 00:29:12.316
YOANI SANCHEZ:
[SPEAKING SPANISH]

00:29:12.316 --> 00:29:15.160
TRANSLATOR: And creativity
is also necessity's daughter.

00:29:15.160 --> 00:29:21.810
YOANI SANCHEZ:
[SPEAKING SPANISH]

00:29:21.810 --> 00:29:24.150
TRANSLATOR: The hardest thing
is to keep up and maintain

00:29:24.150 --> 00:29:26.450
your creativity when you
have all resources available

00:29:26.450 --> 00:29:27.950
and all possibilities open.

00:29:27.950 --> 00:29:29.960
YOANI SANCHEZ:
[SPEAKING SPANISH]

00:29:29.960 --> 00:29:32.320
TRANSLATOR: But that
shouldn't be contradictory.

00:29:32.320 --> 00:29:41.770
YOANI SANCHEZ:
[SPEAKING SPANISH]

00:29:41.770 --> 00:29:44.040
TRANSLATOR: And so a good
piece of advice is to,

00:29:44.040 --> 00:29:46.830
for one second, place yourself
in the skin of someone

00:29:46.830 --> 00:29:47.900
who has very little.

00:29:47.900 --> 00:29:58.822
YOANI SANCHEZ:
[SPEAKING SPANISH]

00:29:58.822 --> 00:30:00.530
TRANSLATOR: So place
yourself in the skin

00:30:00.530 --> 00:30:03.960
of a citizen in a country that
lacks internet, that does not

00:30:03.960 --> 00:30:06.590
have access to Paypal, that
has never been able to purchase

00:30:06.590 --> 00:30:08.950
a flight ticket
via the internet.

00:30:08.950 --> 00:30:15.580
YOANI SANCHEZ:
[SPEAKING SPANISH]

00:30:15.580 --> 00:30:17.290
TRANSLATOR: Place
yourself in the shoes

00:30:17.290 --> 00:30:20.430
of a person who has never been
able to see online a YouTube

00:30:20.430 --> 00:30:21.040
video.

00:30:21.040 --> 00:30:26.340
YOANI SANCHEZ:
[SPEAKING SPANISH]

00:30:26.340 --> 00:30:28.480
TRANSLATOR: Or
such as is my case,

00:30:28.480 --> 00:30:31.830
often, I can't even see how many
followers I have on Twitter.

00:30:31.830 --> 00:30:34.986
YOANI SANCHEZ:
[SPEAKING SPANISH]

00:30:34.986 --> 00:30:37.080
TRANSLATOR: I
would say that that

00:30:37.080 --> 00:30:40.600
would be a good exercise
to engender creativity.

00:30:40.600 --> 00:30:49.884
YOANI SANCHEZ:
[SPEAKING SPANISH]

00:30:49.884 --> 00:30:52.050
TRANSLATOR: And also, to
remember that anything that

00:30:52.050 --> 00:30:54.390
is created here or
elsewhere, often

00:30:54.390 --> 00:30:58.700
in roundabout and small
ways, reaches us in Cuba.

00:30:58.700 --> 00:31:00.710
MARY GROVE: I'd like
to do a brief thing we

00:31:00.710 --> 00:31:03.180
think of as free
word association.

00:31:03.180 --> 00:31:04.960
So I'm going to say
one word and ask

00:31:04.960 --> 00:31:07.564
you to say the first word
that comes to your mind.

00:31:07.564 --> 00:31:10.225
TRANSLATOR: [SPEAKING SPANISH]

00:31:10.225 --> 00:31:10.850

00:32:18.220 --> 00:32:20.012
please join me in a
warm round of applause.

00:32:20.012 --> 00:32:21.053
YOANI SANCHEZ: Thank you.

00:32:21.053 --> 00:32:21.765
Thank you.

00:32:21.765 --> 00:32:24.170
Thank you very much, thank you.

00:32:24.170 --> 00:32:28.900
[APPLAUSE]

00:32:28.900 --> 00:32:31.400
MARY GROVE: Nowhere is there a
better example of this notion

00:32:31.400 --> 00:32:33.960
that constraint breeds
tremendous creativity,

00:32:33.960 --> 00:32:36.225
and you are just a living
testament to all that

00:32:36.225 --> 00:32:37.850
is possible, and
we really thank you

00:32:37.850 --> 00:32:40.780
for taking the time to
share your insights with us.

00:32:40.780 --> 00:32:42.190
And I know a lot
of my colleagues

00:32:42.190 --> 00:32:43.106
likely have questions.

00:32:43.106 --> 00:32:45.300
If you could just
speak loudly, and I'll

00:32:45.300 --> 00:32:48.670
repeat it for the benefit of
those on video conference.

00:32:48.670 --> 00:32:50.744
Do you have hopes for Cuba?

00:32:50.744 --> 00:32:52.520
TRANSLATOR: [SPEAKING SPANISH]

00:32:52.520 --> 00:32:54.290
YOANI SANCHEZ:
[SPEAKING SPANISH]

00:32:54.290 --> 00:32:55.480
TRANSLATOR: I have many.

00:32:55.480 --> 00:33:01.395
YOANI SANCHEZ:
[SPEAKING SPANISH]

00:33:01.395 --> 00:33:03.020
TRANSLATOR: Cuba is
precisely a country

00:33:03.020 --> 00:33:06.180
with a lot of future potential.

00:33:06.180 --> 00:33:10.975
YOANI SANCHEZ:
[SPEAKING SPANISH]

00:33:10.975 --> 00:33:12.850
TRANSLATOR: Although at
this particular time,

00:33:12.850 --> 00:33:14.960
we have a scenario
of economic collapse

00:33:14.960 --> 00:33:16.810
and a lack of freedoms.

00:33:16.810 --> 00:33:20.009
YOANI SANCHEZ:
[SPEAKING SPANISH]

00:33:20.009 --> 00:33:22.050
TRANSLATOR: Cuba has an
incredible human capital.

00:33:22.050 --> 00:33:24.650
YOANI SANCHEZ:
[SPEAKING SPANISH]

00:33:24.650 --> 00:33:27.270
TRANSLATOR: In fact, here in
Google, there work many Cubans.

00:33:27.270 --> 00:33:34.110
YOANI SANCHEZ:
[SPEAKING SPANISH]

00:33:34.110 --> 00:33:37.890
TRANSLATOR: In fact,
professional academic levels

00:33:37.890 --> 00:33:39.210
are very high.

00:33:39.210 --> 00:33:45.260
YOANI SANCHEZ:
[SPEAKING SPANISH]

00:33:45.260 --> 00:33:47.870
TRANSLATOR: And people
are more and more

00:33:47.870 --> 00:33:51.060
thirsting for political
and economic change.

00:33:51.060 --> 00:33:59.455
YOANI SANCHEZ:
[SPEAKING SPANISH]

00:33:59.455 --> 00:34:01.080
TRANSLATOR: So it
would not surprise me

00:34:01.080 --> 00:34:02.960
if halfway through
the 21st century,

00:34:02.960 --> 00:34:05.640
we were an economic or a
technological powerhouse

00:34:05.640 --> 00:34:06.510
in the region.

00:34:06.510 --> 00:34:08.969
YOANI SANCHEZ:
[SPEAKING SPANISH]

00:34:08.969 --> 00:34:12.110
TRANSLATOR: And if we had our
own version of Silicon Valley.

00:34:12.110 --> 00:34:16.639
YOANI SANCHEZ:
[SPEAKING SPANISH]

00:34:16.639 --> 00:34:19.520
TRANSLATOR: I'll first tell
you the government's position.

00:34:19.520 --> 00:34:27.889
YOANI SANCHEZ:
[SPEAKING SPANISH]

00:34:27.889 --> 00:34:29.659
TRANSLATOR: The Cuban
government explains

00:34:29.659 --> 00:34:33.630
the lack of internet
and access based firmly

00:34:33.630 --> 00:34:36.719
on the American embargo.

00:34:36.719 --> 00:34:41.560
YOANI SANCHEZ:
[SPEAKING SPANISH]

00:34:41.560 --> 00:34:44.230
TRANSLATOR: The same
restrictions that mean that

00:34:44.230 --> 00:34:47.440
certain Google services
cannot be used in Cuba.

00:34:47.440 --> 00:34:58.480
YOANI SANCHEZ:
[SPEAKING SPANISH]

00:34:58.480 --> 00:35:00.120
TRANSLATOR: However,
this argument

00:35:00.120 --> 00:35:04.790
has lost its truthfulness
after several years ago,

00:35:04.790 --> 00:35:07.000
a fiber optic cable was
installed from Venezuela

00:35:07.000 --> 00:35:08.070
to Cuba.

00:35:08.070 --> 00:35:19.917
YOANI SANCHEZ:
[SPEAKING SPANISH]

00:35:19.917 --> 00:35:22.000
TRANSLATOR: At this point,
at this moment in time,

00:35:22.000 --> 00:35:24.120
the cable is functional,
but the government

00:35:24.120 --> 00:35:30.290
has decided to use it to open
118 public internet access

00:35:30.290 --> 00:35:32.110
spots across the country.

00:35:32.110 --> 00:35:39.844
YOANI SANCHEZ:
[SPEAKING SPANISH]

00:35:39.844 --> 00:35:41.260
TRANSLATOR: The
authorities do not

00:35:41.260 --> 00:35:45.980
seem interested in granting
personal home internet access

00:35:45.980 --> 00:35:47.930
or access through mobile phones.

00:35:47.930 --> 00:35:54.682
YOANI SANCHEZ:
[SPEAKING SPANISH]

00:35:54.682 --> 00:35:56.140
TRANSLATOR: And
the prices are also

00:35:56.140 --> 00:36:00.770
high as a means of kind of
being cost prohibitive for most

00:36:00.770 --> 00:36:01.730
ordinary Cubans.

00:36:01.730 --> 00:36:04.660
YOANI SANCHEZ:
[SPEAKING SPANISH]

00:36:04.660 --> 00:36:06.820
TRANSLATOR: The reason
is fear of the internet.

00:36:06.820 --> 00:36:22.600
YOANI SANCHEZ:
[SPEAKING SPANISH]

00:36:22.600 --> 00:36:26.130
TRANSLATOR: A system that has
based itself on the limitation

00:36:26.130 --> 00:36:29.100
of information and on the
controlling of a narrative

00:36:29.100 --> 00:36:33.280
cannot possibly survive the
avalanche of information that

00:36:33.280 --> 00:36:35.380
comes from the internet.

00:36:35.380 --> 00:36:39.360
AUDIENCE: I've always wondered
how the Castro brothers have

00:36:39.360 --> 00:36:43.030
been able to get the Cuban
people to tolerate that much.

00:36:43.030 --> 00:36:48.390
And I understand that they
have lots of controls.

00:36:48.390 --> 00:36:52.000
But there's also not
a violent reaction,

00:36:52.000 --> 00:36:57.900
so they've got to manage
a certain level-- achieve

00:36:57.900 --> 00:37:00.470
a certain level of
tolerance among the people.

00:37:00.470 --> 00:37:02.780
And I see that in my country
as well, in Venezuela,

00:37:02.780 --> 00:37:05.060
where after 14
years of revolution,

00:37:05.060 --> 00:37:08.720
we are having very
extreme scarcity now,

00:37:08.720 --> 00:37:12.306
and people fighting for a little
milk in the grocery stores.

00:37:12.306 --> 00:37:15.440
And the government still
has 50% popularity.

00:37:15.440 --> 00:37:19.340
So how is that process of
getting people accustomed?

00:37:19.340 --> 00:37:23.144
YOANI SANCHEZ:
[SPEAKING SPANISH]

00:37:23.144 --> 00:37:24.560
TRANSLATOR: There
are many reasons

00:37:24.560 --> 00:37:26.395
for this social inertia.

00:37:26.395 --> 00:37:30.804
YOANI SANCHEZ:
[SPEAKING SPANISH]

00:37:30.804 --> 00:37:32.220
TRANSLATOR: Firstly,
my generation

00:37:32.220 --> 00:37:34.030
does not know of any
other [INAUDIBLE].

00:37:34.030 --> 00:37:40.989
YOANI SANCHEZ:
[SPEAKING SPANISH]

00:37:40.989 --> 00:37:43.030
TRANSLATOR: My mother was
born under the Castros.

00:37:43.030 --> 00:37:44.250
I was born under the Castros.

00:37:44.250 --> 00:37:46.340
And my son, who is 18
years old, was also

00:37:46.340 --> 00:37:47.630
born under the Castros.

00:37:47.630 --> 00:37:51.395
YOANI SANCHEZ:
[SPEAKING SPANISH]

00:37:51.395 --> 00:37:53.520
TRANSLATOR: If the Castros
last several more years,

00:37:53.520 --> 00:37:55.680
my grandchildren will
be born under them.

00:37:55.680 --> 00:38:04.950
YOANI SANCHEZ:
[SPEAKING SPANISH]

00:38:04.950 --> 00:38:07.520
TRANSLATOR: This creates the
sensation that you cannot

00:38:07.520 --> 00:38:10.200
change anything, that it is a
curse with which you have been

00:38:10.200 --> 00:38:12.000
born and cannot change.

00:38:12.000 --> 00:38:20.800
YOANI SANCHEZ:
[SPEAKING SPANISH]

00:38:20.800 --> 00:38:22.670
TRANSLATOR: Another
issue or comment

00:38:22.670 --> 00:38:26.540
is that rebelliousness in Cuba,
for decades, has been expressed

00:38:26.540 --> 00:38:29.580
in leaving and escaping
and not in confronting.

00:38:29.580 --> 00:38:38.399
YOANI SANCHEZ:
[SPEAKING SPANISH]

00:38:38.399 --> 00:38:40.565
TRANSLATOR: It's very sad,
but a majority of Cubans,

00:38:40.565 --> 00:38:43.020
or a significant
proportion of Cubans,

00:38:43.020 --> 00:38:46.950
prefer to face a shark
in the Florida straits

00:38:46.950 --> 00:38:49.100
than a policeman in
the streets of Havana.

00:38:49.100 --> 00:38:58.256
YOANI SANCHEZ:
[SPEAKING SPANISH]

00:38:58.256 --> 00:38:59.630
TRANSLATOR: Yet
another reason is

00:38:59.630 --> 00:39:03.680
that the government cut all
of the infrastructure that

00:39:03.680 --> 00:39:08.060
would have allowed economic
independence to civil society.

00:39:08.060 --> 00:39:13.787
YOANI SANCHEZ:
[SPEAKING SPANISH]

00:39:13.787 --> 00:39:16.120
TRANSLATOR: And severed all
informational infrastructure

00:39:16.120 --> 00:39:17.400
parallel to the government.

00:39:17.400 --> 00:39:26.302
YOANI SANCHEZ:
[SPEAKING SPANISH]

00:39:26.302 --> 00:39:28.760
TRANSLATOR: In the nations of
the Arab Spring, for example,

00:39:28.760 --> 00:39:32.050
technology was a primary
tool for the population

00:39:32.050 --> 00:39:34.110
to communicate and congregate.

00:39:34.110 --> 00:39:38.999
YOANI SANCHEZ:
[SPEAKING SPANISH]

00:39:38.999 --> 00:39:41.540
TRANSLATOR: But in Cuba, how
can I communicate to my neighbor

00:39:41.540 --> 00:39:44.340
that I agree with him?

00:39:44.340 --> 00:39:48.577
YOANI SANCHEZ:
[SPEAKING SPANISH]

00:39:48.577 --> 00:39:50.160
TRANSLATOR: Despite
this, I do believe

00:39:50.160 --> 00:39:54.180
that Cubans are
slowly waking up.

00:39:54.180 --> 00:40:05.306
YOANI SANCHEZ:
[SPEAKING SPANISH]

00:40:05.306 --> 00:40:06.950
TRANSLATOR: I'm very critical.

00:40:06.950 --> 00:40:13.570
I've always perceived that
the US restrictions are

00:40:13.570 --> 00:40:16.190
the excuse of the Cuban
government, the scapegoat

00:40:16.190 --> 00:40:18.710
of the Cuban government,
for justifying everything

00:40:18.710 --> 00:40:23.370
from economic situation
to the lack of liberties.

00:40:23.370 --> 00:40:31.910
YOANI SANCHEZ:
[SPEAKING SPANISH]

00:40:31.910 --> 00:40:34.420
TRANSLATOR: As such, I
would like for the embargo

00:40:34.420 --> 00:40:38.010
to end tomorrow to see how the
Cuban government would explain

00:40:38.010 --> 00:40:40.810
the lack of access to the
internet or the inability

00:40:40.810 --> 00:40:43.630
to form other political parties.

00:40:43.630 --> 00:40:51.696
YOANI SANCHEZ:
[SPEAKING SPANISH]

00:40:51.696 --> 00:40:54.070
TRANSLATOR: The quality of
the educational system in Cuba

00:40:54.070 --> 00:40:56.830
has also suffered
significantly in recent years.

00:40:56.830 --> 00:41:04.500
YOANI SANCHEZ:
[SPEAKING SPANISH]

00:41:04.500 --> 00:41:08.230
TRANSLATOR: There is a popular
myth exported from Cuba

00:41:08.230 --> 00:41:10.740
that we have excellent
public health

00:41:10.740 --> 00:41:12.530
systems and educational systems.

00:41:12.530 --> 00:41:20.300
YOANI SANCHEZ:
[SPEAKING SPANISH]

00:41:20.300 --> 00:41:24.640
TRANSLATOR: In truth, it is
extensive and reaches everyone

00:41:24.640 --> 00:41:28.470
in the country, but the
quality has declined.

00:41:28.470 --> 00:41:39.320
YOANI SANCHEZ:
[SPEAKING SPANISH]

00:41:39.320 --> 00:41:41.650
TRANSLATOR: When Soviet
subsidies were halted,

00:41:41.650 --> 00:41:43.370
the Cuban
infrastructure could not

00:41:43.370 --> 00:41:47.200
maintain the educational
or medical infrastructure

00:41:47.200 --> 00:41:48.140
that had been set up.

00:41:48.140 --> 00:42:02.582
YOANI SANCHEZ:
[SPEAKING SPANISH]

00:42:02.582 --> 00:42:04.040
TRANSLATOR: As
such, there has been

00:42:04.040 --> 00:42:06.850
a huge exodus of
teachers and instructors.

00:42:06.850 --> 00:42:11.130
An instructor, for example,
of technology and software

00:42:11.130 --> 00:42:12.960
and kind of information
systems would

00:42:12.960 --> 00:42:15.910
have a maximum monthly
salary of $30 a month.

00:42:15.910 --> 00:42:22.150
YOANI SANCHEZ:
[SPEAKING SPANISH]

00:42:22.150 --> 00:42:27.330
TRANSLATOR: And in addition
to the financial restrictions

00:42:27.330 --> 00:42:30.680
or limitations,
there's also the issue

00:42:30.680 --> 00:42:32.770
of significant
political indoctrination

00:42:32.770 --> 00:42:34.160
of the educational system.

00:42:34.160 --> 00:42:44.070
YOANI SANCHEZ:
[SPEAKING SPANISH]

00:42:44.070 --> 00:42:47.560
TRANSLATOR: It's very difficult
for a professor of technology

00:42:47.560 --> 00:42:50.300
or information systems
to be in a classroom

00:42:50.300 --> 00:42:52.530
with students who do not
have access to the internet.

00:42:52.530 --> 00:42:53.950
How do you teach that?

00:42:53.950 --> 00:43:00.150
YOANI SANCHEZ:
[SPEAKING SPANISH]

00:43:00.150 --> 00:43:02.790
TRANSLATOR: And there's also,
the government has an intention

00:43:02.790 --> 00:43:07.140
to paint the internet
as a battlefield.

00:43:07.140 --> 00:43:10.760
YOANI SANCHEZ:
[SPEAKING SPANISH]

00:43:10.760 --> 00:43:13.840

lot of soldiers to wage battle.

YOANI SANCHEZ:
[SPEAKING SPANISH]

00:43:17.422 --> 00:43:19.880

can tell you is still little.

YOANI SANCHEZ:
[SPEAKING SPANISH]

00:43:30.405 --> 00:43:33.580
TRANSLATOR: But in Cuba, we
have a specific department

00:43:33.580 --> 00:43:37.340
in which students
focus on waging

00:43:37.340 --> 00:43:40.430
ideological battles
on the internet.

00:43:40.430 --> 00:43:51.676
YOANI SANCHEZ:
[SPEAKING SPANISH]

00:43:51.676 --> 00:43:53.300
TRANSLATOR: From
blogs that are in line

00:43:53.300 --> 00:43:57.080
with government thinking to
people that enter other forums

00:43:57.080 --> 00:43:59.280
or comment on other
blogs to guide

00:43:59.280 --> 00:44:02.290
the discussion more in
favor to the positions

00:44:02.290 --> 00:44:03.090
of the government.

[SPEAKING SPANISH]

00:44:21.727 --> 00:44:23.310

I imagine that it's

00:44:23.310 --> 00:44:27.000
very difficult for an
instructor of anything

00:44:27.000 --> 00:44:29.990
that touches the internet, and
who has a more modern mind,

00:44:29.990 --> 00:44:34.602
to be teaching anything that
touches with technology.

00:44:34.602 --> 00:44:36.240
MARY GROVE: Last
question, if I may.

00:44:36.240 --> 00:44:40.135
What is your greatest hope
for Cuba and for the future?

00:44:40.135 --> 00:44:44.380
YOANI SANCHEZ:
[SPEAKING SPANISH]

00:44:44.380 --> 00:44:46.790
TRANSLATOR: I think
that Cuba needs freedom.

00:44:46.790 --> 00:44:52.840
YOANI SANCHEZ:
[SPEAKING SPANISH]

00:44:52.840 --> 00:44:55.710
TRANSLATOR: The freedom to
stand on a corner and scream,

00:44:55.710 --> 00:44:56.830
there's no liberty here.

00:44:56.830 --> 00:45:03.529
YOANI SANCHEZ:
[SPEAKING SPANISH]

00:45:03.529 --> 00:45:06.070
TRANSLATOR: The day that I can
do that in a street in Havana,

00:45:06.070 --> 00:45:08.607
I will feel that my country
has entered the future.

00:45:08.607 --> 00:45:10.940
MARY GROVE: On behalf of all
of us here, muchas gracias.

00:45:10.940 --> 00:45:11.540
YOANI SANCHEZ: Muchas gracias.

00:45:11.540 --> 00:45:12.440
Thank you very much.

00:45:12.440 --> 00:45:15.599
[APPLAUSE]

00:45:15.599 --> 00:45:16.640
YOANI SANCHEZ: Thank you.

00:45:16.640 --> 00:45:25.090
[APPLAUSE]
