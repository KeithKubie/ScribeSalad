&gt;&gt; Recorder: From the Library
of Congress in Washington DC.

00:00:04.220 --> 00:00:09.840 position:56%
&gt;&gt; Catalina Gomez: Now it's my great
pleasure to introduce our speaker.

00:00:09.840 --> 00:00:14.870
This wonderful children's
author and illustrator,

00:00:14.870 --> 00:00:17.980
brilliant artist, Juana Medina.

00:00:17.980 --> 00:00:21.610
Juana Medina is an illustrator
and author of children's books,

00:00:21.610 --> 00:00:24.880
as well as a teacher at
George Washington University.

00:00:24.880 --> 00:00:27.670
Juana grew up in Bogotá,
Colombia and studied

00:00:27.670 --> 00:00:30.290
at the Rhode Island
School of Design.

00:00:30.290 --> 00:00:33.980
Medina was a first winner of the
Jay Kennedy Memorial Scholarship,

00:00:33.980 --> 00:00:38.230
an award given yearly by the
National Cartoonist Society

00:00:38.230 --> 00:00:41.500
to a top college cartoonist
in North America.

00:00:41.500 --> 00:00:46.680
She is also the recipient of a
Marion Vannett Ridgway Honor Award

00:00:46.680 --> 00:00:50.730
and [inaudible] Colombianos, a
100 Colombians, an honor granted

00:00:50.730 --> 00:00:54.800
to 100 successful Colombians
living abroad.

00:00:54.800 --> 00:00:57.870
Her books for children
include "One Big Salad,"

00:00:57.870 --> 00:01:01.230
a delicious counting
book and "Smick."

00:01:01.230 --> 00:01:03.970
And her latest picture
book that which -

00:01:03.970 --> 00:01:05.590 position:56%
"Smick" was her latest picture book.

00:01:05.590 --> 00:01:09.290
Today we're here to celebrate
her latest book, which is "Juana

00:01:09.290 --> 00:01:13.870
and Lucas", a book and it's
published by Candlewick Press.

00:01:13.870 --> 00:01:16.330
And this tells the story
of a young girl's decision

00:01:16.330 --> 00:01:20.210
to learn English back in her
home city in Bogotá, Colombia.

00:01:20.210 --> 00:01:23.370
This book particularly moved
me because I happen to be

00:01:23.370 --> 00:01:25.430
from the same city as Juana.

00:01:25.430 --> 00:01:29.970
So it's a beautiful,
beautiful - a beautiful book.

00:01:29.970 --> 00:01:34.690
So "Juana and Lucas," as you know
it's being sold today, here today.

00:01:34.690 --> 00:01:35.990
I'll also like to announce

00:01:35.990 --> 00:01:38.630
that Juana had started a
beautiful collaboration

00:01:38.630 --> 00:01:42.000
with our national poet
laureate [inaudible] Barrera.

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:47.980
So very soon you'll start hearing
about this beautiful collaboration.

00:01:47.980 --> 00:01:50.990
It's kind of an e-book
story collaboration

00:01:50.990 --> 00:01:55.750
with the poet laureate featuring
very fun character called

00:01:55.750 --> 00:01:57.300
Catalina Neon.

00:01:57.300 --> 00:02:01.510 position:56%
And it'll be a collaboration also
with second and third grade students

00:02:01.510 --> 00:02:04.460
and schools around the country.

00:02:04.460 --> 00:02:06.550
So that will be really exciting.

00:02:06.550 --> 00:02:08.160
So I think that is all.

00:02:08.160 --> 00:02:10.480
Please join me in welcoming
Juana Medina.

00:02:10.480 --> 00:02:12.280
Thank you.

00:02:12.280 --> 00:02:17.490
[ Clapping ]

00:02:17.490 --> 00:02:20.470
&gt;&gt; Juana Medina: [Inaudible]
All right.

00:02:20.470 --> 00:02:25.560
Catalina, thank you for such
a beautiful introduction,

00:02:25.560 --> 00:02:26.910
such a pleasure being here.

00:02:26.910 --> 00:02:31.050
First, I just wanted to say hello.

00:02:31.050 --> 00:02:34.750
And to share a little bit
about this book, which is,

00:02:34.750 --> 00:02:37.830
as Catalina said called
Juana and Lucas.

00:02:37.830 --> 00:02:42.090
The main character is called,
just like me, because it's based

00:02:42.090 --> 00:02:46.150
on a story that happened
when I was a child.

00:02:46.150 --> 00:02:50.990
Basically, my mom picked me
up at school and I was furious

00:02:50.990 --> 00:02:52.570
because they had said that I needed

00:02:52.570 --> 00:02:55.100
to learn something
called "the English."

00:02:55.100 --> 00:02:57.590
We were living then
in Bogotá, Colombia.

00:02:57.590 --> 00:03:00.430
And my mom said "Well, if
you don't learn English.

00:03:00.430 --> 00:03:01.730
You'll be in trouble.

00:03:01.730 --> 00:03:05.130
We're going to go visit
Mickey Mouse in Disney World.

00:03:05.130 --> 00:03:07.150
So you might want to learn."

00:03:07.150 --> 00:03:11.630
So this is based, loosely based,
in what happened many years ago.

00:03:11.630 --> 00:03:17.150
But today, I'm going to
need a little bit of help.

00:03:17.150 --> 00:03:26.560
So first, I need to ask
are you willing to help me?

00:03:26.560 --> 00:03:30.580
I really need to -
yes, thank you so much.

00:03:30.580 --> 00:03:34.150
Do any of you speak
Spanish by any chance?

00:03:34.150 --> 00:03:35.450
All right.

00:03:35.450 --> 00:03:38.570
Yes, two Spanish speakers,
three Spanish speakers.

00:03:38.570 --> 00:03:43.350
Great. Well, as I said, this
story takes place in Bogotá.

00:03:43.350 --> 00:03:47.840
Bogotá is a beautiful
city in Colombia.

00:03:47.840 --> 00:03:53.110
Yay. And because Juana lives
in Bogotá and we're going

00:03:53.110 --> 00:03:55.120
to be hearing about Bogotá.

00:03:55.120 --> 00:04:01.200
We're going to - I'm going to be
asking you a very special favor.

00:04:01.200 --> 00:04:07.980
First of all, whenever
you see the word "Bogotá,"

00:04:07.980 --> 00:04:09.450
you're going to see a highlight.

00:04:09.450 --> 00:04:13.930
So it's going to appear in blue,
just as it is on the screen.

00:04:13.930 --> 00:04:18.930
So whenever you see it, would you
be able to say out loud with me.

00:04:18.930 --> 00:04:20.450
Bogotá.

00:04:20.450 --> 00:04:22.410
&gt;&gt; Audience: Bogotá.

00:04:22.410 --> 00:04:25.220
&gt;&gt; Juana Medina: That was
pretty just, kind of quiet.

00:04:25.220 --> 00:04:28.440
And I know there's a lot of
noise, but let's try that again.

00:04:28.440 --> 00:04:29.740
Bogotá.

00:04:29.740 --> 00:04:31.040
&gt;&gt; Audience: Bogotá.

00:04:31.040 --> 00:04:32.340
&gt;&gt; Juana Medina: Yes,
that's much better.

00:04:32.340 --> 00:04:33.640
All right.

00:04:33.640 --> 00:04:37.680
So let's get ready to learn
about Juana and Lucas.

00:04:42.250 --> 00:04:44.460
All right.

00:04:44.460 --> 00:04:46.140
So here is Juana.

00:04:46.140 --> 00:04:51.310
"My name is Juana and
it is spelled J-U-A-N-A.

00:04:51.310 --> 00:04:56.340
And it is pronounced Juana.

00:04:57.710 --> 00:05:02.140
Things I like are drawing
sometimes on paper

00:05:02.140 --> 00:05:05.080
and sometimes on other surfaces."

00:05:05.080 --> 00:05:07.770
Do any of you draw
in other surfaces?

00:05:07.770 --> 00:05:12.980
Maybe carpets or walls or
bathtubs or things like that?

00:05:12.980 --> 00:05:16.190
Maybe not, hopefully you
won't get in trouble.

00:05:16.190 --> 00:05:20.260
"Astroman needs no
rockets to fly in space.

00:05:20.260 --> 00:05:25.110
His intergalactic suit and
shiny helmet cover all of him

00:05:25.110 --> 00:05:27.030
and let him glide from galaxy

00:05:27.030 --> 00:05:30.710
to galaxy faster than
I can say Jupiter.

00:05:30.710 --> 00:05:35.570 position:56%
He knows all the constellations from
A to Z. And can redirect a comet

00:05:35.570 --> 00:05:41.200
by simply blowing on it, as if it
were a candle flame on a cupcake.

00:05:41.200 --> 00:05:44.120
No one else can do that.

00:05:44.120 --> 00:05:49.150
My favorite food of all foods,
more than cheese and chocolate

00:05:49.150 --> 00:05:55.260 position:56%
and ice cream, but not all together,
is Brussels sprouts," in...

00:05:55.260 --> 00:05:56.560
&gt;&gt; Audience: Bogotá.

00:05:56.560 --> 00:05:57.860
&gt;&gt; Juana Medina: Yes.

00:05:57.860 --> 00:05:59.170
"Brussels sprouts are
called [foreign language].

00:05:59.170 --> 00:06:06.690
The world has many cities but"?

00:06:06.690 --> 00:06:07.990
&gt;&gt; Audience: Bogotá.

00:06:07.990 --> 00:06:12.360
&gt;&gt; Juana Medina: "Bogotá is
where I am and where school is

00:06:12.360 --> 00:06:15.810
and where mommy and my [foreign
language] and Lucas are.

00:06:15.810 --> 00:06:18.150
And where I play with
Eric and Danielle

00:06:18.150 --> 00:06:23.050
and where I get in
trouble with Huli.

00:06:23.050 --> 00:06:26.590
Bogotá." Whoops, what
happened there?

00:06:26.590 --> 00:06:29.130
Okay. There's another Bogotá there.

00:06:29.130 --> 00:06:32.210
"Bogota, Colombia in
South America is the city

00:06:32.210 --> 00:06:35.050
that is closest to my heart.

00:06:35.050 --> 00:06:37.050
I love"?

00:06:37.050 --> 00:06:38.880
&gt;&gt; Audience: Bogotá.

00:06:38.880 --> 00:06:40.180
&gt;&gt; Juana Medina: "Love it.

00:06:40.180 --> 00:06:43.270
And here's why."

00:06:43.270 --> 00:06:44.820
There's one more.

00:06:44.820 --> 00:06:49.440
"Bogotá has more neighborhoods
than I can count.

00:06:49.440 --> 00:06:54.170
There's a financial district and a
flower district, galleries, houses,

00:06:54.170 --> 00:06:59.120
little coffee shops,
bookstores, it just never stops.

00:06:59.120 --> 00:07:02.460
There are a lot of parts in"?

00:07:02.460 --> 00:07:03.960
&gt;&gt; Audience: Bogotá.

00:07:03.960 --> 00:07:05.260
&gt;&gt; Juana Medina: "...too."

00:07:05.260 --> 00:07:06.560
Yes, thank you.

00:07:06.560 --> 00:07:10.800
"The [foreign language]
is a never ending route

00:07:10.800 --> 00:07:14.070
of bike lanes all across the city.

00:07:14.070 --> 00:07:17.030
So I haven't been able
to go on every bit

00:07:17.030 --> 00:07:19.650
of bike lane across the city.

00:07:19.650 --> 00:07:23.710
It would take me ages to
do it, but I like the idea

00:07:23.710 --> 00:07:25.710
of peddling through town.

00:07:25.710 --> 00:07:34.110
During the day the weather is mild
as if it is eternally springtime.

00:07:34.110 --> 00:07:38.720
Then the night comes and the
ground turns freezing cold,

00:07:38.720 --> 00:07:44.150
so everyone always keeps a
pair of slippers by their bed.

00:07:45.960 --> 00:07:50.820
There are many trees, mostly old
and almost as tall as buildings.

00:07:50.820 --> 00:07:55.080
In the daytime they give shade
from the incredible strong sun.

00:07:55.080 --> 00:07:57.710
At night, when illuminated
from below

00:07:57.710 --> 00:08:02.480
by the street lights they make
shadows of all shapes and sizes."

00:08:02.480 --> 00:08:04.870
Get ready.

00:08:04.870 --> 00:08:06.170
In?

00:08:06.170 --> 00:08:07.470
&gt;&gt; Audience: Bogotá.

00:08:07.470 --> 00:08:11.800
&gt;&gt; Juana Medina: "Bogotá,
Colombia everyone speaks Español.

00:08:11.800 --> 00:08:15.570
They might - there might be a
few who speak other languages,

00:08:15.570 --> 00:08:20.360
but to understand one another
we all mainly speak Spanish.

00:08:20.360 --> 00:08:25.430
Lucas doesn't speak Spanish only
because he doesn't speak at all.

00:08:25.430 --> 00:08:33.250
At bed time chances are" - whoops.

00:08:33.250 --> 00:08:38.580
Hold on, there's somebody I want
you to meet before anything else.

00:08:38.580 --> 00:08:40.980
"I love Lucas.

00:08:40.980 --> 00:08:43.760
Love him and here's why.

00:08:43.760 --> 00:08:51.210
Unlike others, Lucas listens to
absolutely everything I have to say

00:08:51.210 --> 00:08:57.680
without interrupting even when
stories get a little bit long.

00:08:57.680 --> 00:09:01.230
His vision and hearing are so good

00:09:01.230 --> 00:09:05.940
that when mommy is making her way
toward my room Lucas gives me a

00:09:05.940 --> 00:09:11.170
little push with his snout which
gives me time to turn up the light.

00:09:11.170 --> 00:09:14.170
That always saves me
from a talk or two

00:09:14.170 --> 00:09:18.040
about still being awake
past bedtime."

00:09:18.040 --> 00:09:21.360
Do any of you get in
trouble for this?

00:09:21.360 --> 00:09:26.000
I know somebody who does, yes.

00:09:26.000 --> 00:09:28.930
[laughs] "Even though
cleats will never fit him

00:09:28.930 --> 00:09:33.260
and gloves are pointless,
he's a phenomenal goalie.

00:09:33.260 --> 00:09:37.310
He's learned from watching
football matches on TV."

00:09:37.310 --> 00:09:39.910
In Colombia they call
soccer, football.

00:09:39.910 --> 00:09:43.310
So that's why it's
football on screen.

00:09:43.310 --> 00:09:49.680
"He jumps really high, high enough
to get cookies off the counter.

00:09:49.680 --> 00:09:52.970
Plus he'll share them with me.

00:09:52.970 --> 00:09:56.280
He eats math homework like a pro.

00:09:56.280 --> 00:10:01.220
The harder the homework,
the faster he'll eat it.

00:10:01.220 --> 00:10:04.260
No one is better than
Lucas at playing spies.

00:10:04.260 --> 00:10:10.310
No matter where I hide,
he always finds me.

00:10:10.310 --> 00:10:15.910
Lucas always walks to me - he
walks me to and from the bus stop

00:10:15.910 --> 00:10:19.160
on school days, which makes
the walks a lot better

00:10:19.160 --> 00:10:24.310
than they could be.

00:10:24.310 --> 00:10:28.730
I strongly dislike my uniform."

00:10:28.730 --> 00:10:31.880
Do any of you have to
wear uniforms here?

00:10:31.880 --> 00:10:33.620
Do you? Yeah.

00:10:33.620 --> 00:10:35.520
Do you like your uniform?

00:10:35.520 --> 00:10:39.680
No. I don't - I didn't
like mine either.

00:10:39.680 --> 00:10:44.210
"I don't - I strongly dislike
my uniform very strongly

00:10:44.210 --> 00:10:45.510
and here's why.

00:10:45.510 --> 00:10:52.390
The blazer is heavy and hot
and sometimes it makes me very,

00:10:52.390 --> 00:10:56.950
very hot like very
hot celery soup hot.

00:10:56.950 --> 00:10:58.930
It's awful."

00:10:58.930 --> 00:11:01.580
Have any of you been that hot?

00:11:01.580 --> 00:11:04.240
In summer some days felt that hot.

00:11:04.240 --> 00:11:06.330
Kind of. Right?

00:11:06.330 --> 00:11:09.600
"The uniform has a tie
that can make me feel

00:11:09.600 --> 00:11:14.300 position:56%
like I'm choking and that's not fun.

00:11:14.300 --> 00:11:16.350
The skirt is itchy.

00:11:16.350 --> 00:11:20.750
When I play on the monkey
bars I have to watch out

00:11:20.750 --> 00:11:24.800
or boys will be shouting out
that my underpants are pink.

00:11:24.800 --> 00:11:27.030
I think boys should
be doing better things

00:11:27.030 --> 00:11:29.670
than looking at my pink underpants.

00:11:29.670 --> 00:11:34.070
The uniform socks are
supposed to be white,

00:11:34.070 --> 00:11:37.880
but my socks are never truly white.

00:11:37.880 --> 00:11:39.990
It's impossible to have white socks

00:11:39.990 --> 00:11:44.090
when you're a serious
football player,

00:11:44.090 --> 00:11:50.920
playing football while wearing
a school uniform is the worst."

00:11:50.920 --> 00:11:57.690
So I won't share right now
anymore about Juana or Lucas,

00:11:57.690 --> 00:12:00.580
so that you can read
the whole story.

00:12:00.580 --> 00:12:04.000
But I - what I can definitely
tell you is that Juana is

00:12:04.000 --> 00:12:07.660
about to get in serious trouble.

00:12:07.660 --> 00:12:13.040
So if you want to hear more about
it, you can check out the book.

00:12:13.040 --> 00:12:17.130
The other thing I wanted to say is
I hope that this story inspires you

00:12:17.130 --> 00:12:21.040
to share your own stories,
whether it is through writing them

00:12:21.040 --> 00:12:24.410
or drawing them or
just simply talking

00:12:24.410 --> 00:12:26.390
and just sharing them
with somebody else.

00:12:26.390 --> 00:12:31.240
But I think we all have stories
to tell, so for now I'm going

00:12:31.240 --> 00:12:34.210
to draw a few drawings and
I'm going to need your help

00:12:34.210 --> 00:12:36.400
with a little bit of inspiration.

00:12:36.400 --> 00:12:44.920
Let me just get the markers first.

00:12:47.930 --> 00:12:52.640
So we talked about
how Juana usually -

00:12:52.640 --> 00:12:55.780
how Lucas usually eats
Juana's homework.

00:12:55.780 --> 00:13:02.630
What kind of homework did you think
that he must have been eating?

00:13:02.630 --> 00:13:08.170
No idea? Any clues?

00:13:08.170 --> 00:13:11.470
I'm going to draw Lucas and you'll
start thinking about what kind

00:13:11.470 --> 00:13:14.640
of homework he might be eating.

00:13:14.640 --> 00:13:24.590
So let's start by drawing
his ears and then his eyes.

00:13:24.590 --> 00:13:26.400
His little snout.

00:13:26.400 --> 00:13:29.560
Any ideas or nothing yet?

00:13:29.560 --> 00:13:32.590
Yes. English homework?

00:13:32.590 --> 00:13:38.870
Oh-uh. So maybe he's
got a book in his mouth

00:13:40.100 --> 00:13:44.730
and the pages are suffering
a little, kind of wrinkled.

00:13:44.730 --> 00:13:47.350
Might - one page might
be falling out.

00:13:47.350 --> 00:13:50.420
Another one has already fallen out.

00:13:53.410 --> 00:13:56.620
And let's finish his mouth.

00:13:56.620 --> 00:13:59.950
He seems very happy to be
eating English homework.

00:13:59.950 --> 00:14:02.250
Let's write "English."

00:14:08.380 --> 00:14:09.760
What else is going on?

00:14:09.760 --> 00:14:12.060
What could be happening?

00:14:14.590 --> 00:14:17.020
Any ideas?

00:14:17.020 --> 00:14:30.650
Not yet. Would Juana be
worried or she's okay

00:14:30.650 --> 00:14:34.170 position:56%
about him eating the - her homework?

00:14:41.520 --> 00:14:44.350
Yes. She's very happy
because now she doesn't have -

00:14:44.350 --> 00:14:47.150
now she has an excuse for school.

00:14:47.150 --> 00:14:50.430
So should we draw her
very happy, celebrating?

00:14:50.430 --> 00:14:55.030
Okay. I think she's going to
be in real trouble for that.

00:14:55.030 --> 00:14:57.700 position:56%
Let's try drawing Juana celebrating.

00:14:57.700 --> 00:15:00.000
So maybe she's dancing.

00:15:08.170 --> 00:15:11.470
We're drawing her eyes,
her little nose.

00:15:11.470 --> 00:15:14.960
She's got a big smile.

00:15:14.960 --> 00:15:20.260
And she wears her pigtails
and a little barrette.

00:15:20.260 --> 00:15:31.750
What do you think she's dancing to?

00:15:31.750 --> 00:15:34.630
Some music or she's just
making up the music?

00:15:34.630 --> 00:15:35.930
Yes.

00:15:35.930 --> 00:15:37.750
[ Inaudible ]

00:15:37.750 --> 00:15:40.050 position:56%
&gt;&gt; Juana Medina: Some Spanish music?

00:15:40.050 --> 00:15:42.090
[ Inaudible ]

00:15:42.090 --> 00:15:43.390
&gt;&gt; Juana Medina: What's that?

00:15:43.390 --> 00:15:44.690
[ Inaudible ]

00:15:44.690 --> 00:15:46.170 position:56%
&gt;&gt; Juana Medina: Some Spanish music?

00:15:46.170 --> 00:15:49.630
So maybe some salsa
or some merengue.

00:15:51.260 --> 00:15:52.880
She's wearing her socks.

00:15:52.880 --> 00:15:55.490
She's not wearing her shoes.

00:15:55.490 --> 00:16:00.020 position:56%
Maybe we can throw a shoe
somewhere, maybe it flew away, just,

00:16:00.020 --> 00:16:05.540
she's dancing so energetically
her shoe is flying.

00:16:05.540 --> 00:16:11.920
There goes one shoe and
she has a stripy shirt.

00:16:11.920 --> 00:16:16.080
I think she's going
to be in trouble.

00:16:16.080 --> 00:16:19.270
How will she explain this?

00:16:19.270 --> 00:16:23.260
The other foot is right here.

00:16:26.440 --> 00:16:29.000
Let's add a little bit of color.

00:16:30.190 --> 00:16:38.550
So maybe she's wearing a red,
let's put in some red stripes.

00:16:38.550 --> 00:16:48.580
Do any of you know how
to say red in Spanish?

00:16:48.580 --> 00:16:52.310
No? Yes? [Foreign language],
that's right.

00:16:52.310 --> 00:16:53.610
That's fantastic.

00:16:53.610 --> 00:16:59.890
I think Juana loves [foreign
language] or color red.

00:16:59.890 --> 00:17:04.910
Should we add some
color to Lucas as well?

00:17:04.910 --> 00:17:12.100
Maybe a little bit of
color on his collar.

00:17:12.100 --> 00:17:14.710
Should we make it blue,
like in the book?

00:17:14.710 --> 00:17:17.920
Yes? Let's give it a try.

00:17:17.920 --> 00:17:19.670
Some blue.

00:17:19.670 --> 00:17:26.540
And his little tag, so
he doesn't get lost.

00:17:26.540 --> 00:17:31.720
And Juana's English book is green.

00:17:31.720 --> 00:17:41.120
So let's go ahead and color
that book or what is left of it.

00:17:48.020 --> 00:17:50.570
And then maybe a couple
lines on the book.

00:17:50.570 --> 00:17:53.000
We can't really read them
because they're a little far.

00:18:02.040 --> 00:18:06.630
Oh boy, I think she's going to
be in serious trouble very soon.

00:18:06.630 --> 00:18:08.970
Should we do another drawing?

00:18:08.970 --> 00:18:12.350
Yes? Okay.

00:18:12.350 --> 00:18:13.650
Oh, we didn't color the shoe.

00:18:13.650 --> 00:18:15.950
Let's color the shoe first.

00:18:19.020 --> 00:18:24.400
The flying shoe and
maybe, since it's flying,

00:18:24.400 --> 00:18:34.250
we can just give it wings,
might fly away very far.

00:18:35.340 --> 00:18:37.690
There goes the shoe.

00:18:37.690 --> 00:18:42.410
Maybe it's a very stinky
shoe knowing Juana.

00:18:42.410 --> 00:18:45.670
Okay. Are we ready for another one?

00:18:45.670 --> 00:18:48.670
Yeah? Okay.

00:18:48.670 --> 00:18:53.710
What should we do now?

00:18:53.710 --> 00:18:56.870
Should we draw a little
bit of Bogotá, the city.

00:18:56.870 --> 00:18:58.170
Oh, you haven't.

00:18:58.170 --> 00:19:01.540
Yes? Why don't we draw what?

00:19:01.540 --> 00:19:04.860
&gt;&gt; Female: [Inaudible] sitting
on a chair reading her book.

00:19:04.860 --> 00:19:06.160
&gt;&gt; Juana Medina: I like that idea.

00:19:06.160 --> 00:19:10.890
So now we're going to draw Juana
sitting on a chair, reading a book.

00:19:10.890 --> 00:19:16.650 position:56%
So there's a very comfy chair that
Juana really loves and it looks sort

00:19:16.650 --> 00:19:21.120
of like a giant - what
does that look like?

00:19:21.120 --> 00:19:22.420
Yes?

00:19:22.420 --> 00:19:23.720
&gt;&gt;Female: A jelly bean.

00:19:23.720 --> 00:19:25.020
&gt;&gt; Juana Medina: A jelly bean.

00:19:25.020 --> 00:19:26.320
It could be.

00:19:26.320 --> 00:19:27.640
What else does it looks like?

00:19:27.640 --> 00:19:28.940
&gt;&gt; Female: An ear?

00:19:28.940 --> 00:19:30.240
&gt;&gt; Juana Medina: Yes,
could be an ear.

00:19:30.240 --> 00:19:32.770
She could be sitting on an
ear reading an English book,

00:19:32.770 --> 00:19:35.750
that could be cool too.

00:19:35.750 --> 00:19:43.090
So here she is, her hair.

00:19:43.090 --> 00:19:45.930
She always wears a little barrette.

00:19:45.930 --> 00:19:54.550
Do you think she's enjoying this
book or she's about to fall asleep?

00:19:54.550 --> 00:19:56.480
She really likes it?

00:19:56.480 --> 00:20:00.470
So it must be a very
captivating book.

00:20:00.470 --> 00:20:03.400
Here's her hand.

00:20:03.400 --> 00:20:08.090
What could this book be
about that she's so excited?

00:20:08.090 --> 00:20:10.790
It's definitely not about English.

00:20:14.380 --> 00:20:15.680
&gt;&gt; Female: It's about dinosaurs.

00:20:15.680 --> 00:20:16.980
&gt;&gt; Juana Medina: It's about what?

00:20:16.980 --> 00:20:18.280
&gt;&gt; Female: Dinosaurs.

00:20:18.280 --> 00:20:19.580
&gt;&gt; Juana Medina: Dinosaurs.

00:20:19.580 --> 00:20:20.880
I like that.

00:20:20.880 --> 00:20:22.180
All right.

00:20:22.180 --> 00:20:27.970
So let's draw a dinosaur
on the jacket of the book.

00:20:27.970 --> 00:20:31.330
No wonder she's so
entertained by the book.

00:20:31.330 --> 00:20:35.410
It's a pretty funny
looking dinosaur.

00:20:35.410 --> 00:20:38.880
And then let's draw her ear.

00:20:40.350 --> 00:20:44.330
She really likes that book.

00:20:44.330 --> 00:20:48.000
Her stripy shirt.

00:20:57.400 --> 00:20:59.160
She's got her leg up.

00:20:59.160 --> 00:21:01.630
She's so excited about the book.

00:21:07.090 --> 00:21:09.490
The other one down.

00:21:09.490 --> 00:21:11.930
Let's draw some more stripes.

00:21:13.490 --> 00:21:14.860
Hey, where's Lucas?

00:21:14.860 --> 00:21:18.280
What would Lucas be doing
while she reads her book?

00:21:23.620 --> 00:21:24.920
Lucas is where?

00:21:24.920 --> 00:21:26.270
&gt;&gt; Female: On a bone.

00:21:26.270 --> 00:21:27.570
&gt;&gt; Juana Medina: On a boat?

00:21:27.570 --> 00:21:28.870
&gt;&gt; Female: On a bone.

00:21:28.870 --> 00:21:30.170
&gt;&gt; Juana Medina: On a bow?

00:21:30.170 --> 00:21:31.470
&gt;&gt; Female: No, a bone.

00:21:31.470 --> 00:21:33.090
&gt;&gt; Juana Medina: A bone,
oh, chewing on a bone.

00:21:33.090 --> 00:21:35.450
What other ideas are there?

00:21:39.600 --> 00:21:44.350
Yes? Do you want to think
a little bit more about it?

00:21:44.350 --> 00:21:46.140
Reading Juana and Lucas?

00:21:46.140 --> 00:21:52.260
Dancing. Okay, there's
another idea in the back.

00:21:52.260 --> 00:21:53.560
I can't hear.

00:21:53.560 --> 00:21:56.800
&gt;&gt; Female: Trying to eat her book.

00:21:56.800 --> 00:21:58.850
&gt;&gt; Juana Medina: Oh,
trying to eat her book.

00:21:58.850 --> 00:22:03.100
Okay. So we have a number of ideas.

00:22:03.100 --> 00:22:04.400
Let's see.

00:22:04.400 --> 00:22:05.700
Where do we start?

00:22:05.700 --> 00:22:11.970
So here we can draw Lucas
dancing, in two legs.

00:22:11.970 --> 00:22:18.170
There's little Lucas, tu-tu-tu.

00:22:18.170 --> 00:22:19.470
The ears are flopping.

00:22:31.160 --> 00:22:36.020
The tail moving to
the sound of music.

00:22:36.020 --> 00:22:37.320
All right.

00:22:37.320 --> 00:22:39.640
So there's Lucas dancing.

00:22:39.640 --> 00:22:42.370
Now, let's draw Lucas
chewing on a bone.

00:22:42.370 --> 00:22:48.040
Right? So he can be
here chewing on a bone.

00:22:48.040 --> 00:22:50.340
Here's the bone.

00:22:53.310 --> 00:22:55.000
He really is loving that bone.

00:23:03.040 --> 00:23:06.220
He might actually be
kind of falling asleep

00:23:08.100 --> 00:23:11.190
or let's just draw a
happy tail to tell us

00:23:11.190 --> 00:23:17.020
that he is actually just very
focused, loving that bone.

00:23:18.310 --> 00:23:23.670
And now we are going to draw
Lucas trying to eat her book.

00:23:23.670 --> 00:23:26.720
Do you think he'll succeed?

00:23:26.720 --> 00:23:34.830 position:56%
Oh-oh. His mouth is really open big.

00:23:34.830 --> 00:23:40.000
Oh-uh. I hope he doesn't get it.

00:23:41.170 --> 00:23:46.000
The ears. Wow, he really
wants to eat that book.

00:23:57.330 --> 00:23:59.920
All right.

00:23:59.920 --> 00:24:02.220
Should we add some color?

00:24:03.580 --> 00:24:11.130
Yeah? Let's go ahead and
draw in this dinosaur,

00:24:11.130 --> 00:24:20.040
make it green and draw her shirt.

00:24:20.040 --> 00:24:21.340
Drawing her shirt.

00:24:21.340 --> 00:24:23.480
Get some red.

00:24:23.480 --> 00:24:33.630 position:56%
Oh hey, do any of you know how green
is, how do you say green in Spanish?

00:24:33.630 --> 00:24:34.930
&gt;&gt; Female: [Foreign language].

00:24:34.930 --> 00:24:36.230 position:56%
&gt;&gt; Juana Medina: [Foreign language].

00:24:36.230 --> 00:24:37.530
[inaudible].

00:24:37.530 --> 00:24:38.830
And what did we say about red?

00:24:38.830 --> 00:24:40.130
&gt;&gt; Female: [Foreign language].

00:24:40.130 --> 00:24:41.430 position:56%
&gt;&gt; Juana Medina: [Foreign language].

00:24:41.430 --> 00:24:46.740
Okay. Anything else that's
going on in this picture

00:24:46.740 --> 00:24:50.120
that we haven't drawn in?

00:24:50.120 --> 00:24:58.510
Yes? You're going to
have to speak very loud.

00:24:58.510 --> 00:25:06.040
[ Inaudible ]

00:25:06.040 --> 00:25:07.960
&gt;&gt; Juana Medina: The
top of the house?

00:25:07.960 --> 00:25:09.260
&gt;&gt; Male: Yes.

00:25:09.260 --> 00:25:10.560
&gt;&gt; Juana Medina: Okay.

00:25:10.560 --> 00:25:11.860
Of course.

00:25:11.860 --> 00:25:13.160
Otherwise they'll get really
wet if they're reading outside

00:25:13.160 --> 00:25:15.240
and then her book will be ruined.

00:25:15.240 --> 00:25:17.810
Great idea.

00:25:17.810 --> 00:25:20.560
So there we go.

00:25:20.560 --> 00:25:22.970
Now they're all protected.

00:25:22.970 --> 00:25:24.740
Is that good?

00:25:24.740 --> 00:25:27.140
Great. All right.

00:25:27.140 --> 00:25:32.620
Oh, you know what, we
didn't finish this bone.

00:25:32.620 --> 00:25:35.930
There we go.

00:25:35.930 --> 00:25:41.020
Her socks again and we
also forgot her shoes.

00:25:41.020 --> 00:25:44.730
Do you think her shoes
are flying very, very far

00:25:44.730 --> 00:25:48.340
and that's why they're
not in the picture

00:25:48.340 --> 00:25:50.050
or should we draw them
there somewhere?

00:25:50.050 --> 00:25:54.840
&gt;&gt; Male: Up on the
roof of the house.

00:25:54.840 --> 00:25:56.140
&gt;&gt; Juana Medina: On
the roof of the house.

00:25:56.140 --> 00:25:57.790
That's how far they flew?

00:25:57.790 --> 00:26:04.180
Here's one shoe on
the roof of the house.

00:26:04.180 --> 00:26:05.620
I like that idea too.

00:26:05.620 --> 00:26:07.470
All right.

00:26:07.470 --> 00:26:10.360
But still with the wings.

00:26:10.360 --> 00:26:13.220
And let's draw the
other one right here.

00:26:14.330 --> 00:26:17.340
Maybe this one is falling
in the chimney.

00:26:21.150 --> 00:26:23.730
Poor Santa's not going
to make it through.

00:26:26.010 --> 00:26:27.320
[ Inaudible ]

00:26:27.320 --> 00:26:29.620
&gt;&gt; Juana Medina: [Laughs]
That's true.

00:26:34.080 --> 00:26:36.360
Or maybe he'll just
leave her presence

00:26:36.360 --> 00:26:39.710
in the shoe out in the chimney top.

00:26:39.710 --> 00:26:41.010
Okay.

00:26:41.010 --> 00:26:46.470
&gt;&gt; Male: [Inaudible] snowed on.

00:26:46.470 --> 00:26:48.270
&gt;&gt; Juana Medina: Let's hope
it doesn't get snowed on.

00:26:48.270 --> 00:26:49.570
That's true.

00:26:49.570 --> 00:26:50.870
All right.

00:26:50.870 --> 00:26:52.990
Are we missing anything
else in this picture?

00:26:52.990 --> 00:26:57.480
Are we ready to just
leave it as it is?

00:26:57.480 --> 00:26:59.780
Last chance.

00:27:05.710 --> 00:27:08.220
Yes?

00:27:08.220 --> 00:27:09.650
&gt;&gt; Juana Medina: A
sky above the house.

00:27:09.650 --> 00:27:12.180
Of course, we need a
sky above the house.

00:27:12.180 --> 00:27:14.950
So let's draw in some clouds.

00:27:14.950 --> 00:27:19.490
Thank goodness there's
no sign of storms

00:27:19.490 --> 00:27:23.930
or those shoes would
be really damp, wet.

00:27:27.620 --> 00:27:31.310
Big sun shining.

00:27:32.350 --> 00:27:35.290
Juana should be outside
playing instead of inside,

00:27:35.290 --> 00:27:42.120
but good thing she's reading books,
so we'll let her just play inside.

00:27:42.120 --> 00:27:43.420
All right.

00:27:43.420 --> 00:27:44.720
There we go.

00:27:44.720 --> 00:27:46.020
I hope you had fun.

00:27:46.020 --> 00:27:48.580
I had a lot of fun
meeting all of you.

00:27:48.580 --> 00:27:51.400
And thank you to Steve
for being here with us.

00:27:51.400 --> 00:27:53.200
Thank you.
