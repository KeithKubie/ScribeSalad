useful pull-to-refresh library in there
 

00:17:08.010 --> 00:17:09.710
useful pull-to-refresh library in there
and those well it's an imageview that's

00:17:09.710 --> 00:17:09.720
and those well it's an imageview that's
 

00:17:09.720 --> 00:17:12.860
and those well it's an imageview that's
got pinched to shrink and those can do

00:17:12.860 --> 00:17:12.870
got pinched to shrink and those can do
 

00:17:12.870 --> 00:17:17.750
got pinched to shrink and those can do
this like an multi-touch zooming image

00:17:17.750 --> 00:17:17.760
this like an multi-touch zooming image
 

00:17:17.760 --> 00:17:20.929

while just pinched off the old galleria

00:17:25.939 --> 00:17:25.949
while just pinched off the old galleria
 

00:17:25.949 --> 00:17:31.250
while just pinched off the old galleria
and so the old of really you know it's

00:17:31.250 --> 00:17:31.260
and so the old of really you know it's
 

00:17:31.260 --> 00:17:34.010
and so the old of really you know it's
open source exactly yeah that's the

00:17:34.010 --> 00:17:34.020
open source exactly yeah that's the
 

00:17:34.020 --> 00:17:35.210
open source exactly yeah that's the
whole point

00:17:35.210 --> 00:17:35.220
whole point
 

00:17:35.220 --> 00:17:38.310
whole point
yeah I see people doing pinch zooming

00:17:38.310 --> 00:17:38.320
yeah I see people doing pinch zooming
 

00:17:38.320 --> 00:17:40.799
yeah I see people doing pinch zooming
wrong especially like a lot of people do

00:17:40.799 --> 00:17:40.809
wrong especially like a lot of people do

00:17:45.570 --> 00:17:45.580
pitch they don't actually do panning at
 

00:17:45.580 --> 00:17:47.789
pitch they don't actually do panning at
the same time like yeah like that it

00:17:47.789 --> 00:17:47.799
the same time like yeah like that it
 

00:17:47.799 --> 00:17:48.660
the same time like yeah like that it
really annoys me when you see an

00:17:48.660 --> 00:17:48.670
really annoys me when you see an
 

00:17:48.670 --> 00:17:50.130
really annoys me when you see an
implementation it doesn't do that it's

00:17:50.130 --> 00:17:50.140
implementation it doesn't do that it's
 

00:17:50.140 --> 00:17:52.320
implementation it doesn't do that it's
like we've open source code which shows

00:17:52.320 --> 00:17:52.330
like we've open source code which shows
 

00:17:52.330 --> 00:17:54.900
like we've open source code which shows
exactly how to do this like there are

00:17:54.900 --> 00:17:54.910
exactly how to do this like there are
 

00:17:54.910 --> 00:17:58.470
exactly how to do this like there are
you doing it wrong exactly yes are

00:17:58.470 --> 00:17:58.480
you doing it wrong exactly yes are
 

00:17:58.480 --> 00:17:59.730
you doing it wrong exactly yes are
having a good library which is kind of

00:17:59.730 --> 00:17:59.740

for libraries and but yeah the one thing

00:18:39.960 --> 00:18:39.970
for libraries and but yeah the one thing
 

00:18:39.970 --> 00:18:41.190

got found out that it's not

00:18:41.190 --> 00:18:41.200
got found out that it's not
 

00:18:41.200 --> 00:18:43.530
got found out that it's not
multi-threaded it's single threaded so

00:18:43.530 --> 00:18:43.540

custom resource and you can reuse that

00:22:39.930 --> 00:22:39.940
custom resource and you can reuse that
 

00:22:39.940 --> 00:22:45.090

something similar i use a set of

00:23:07.070 --> 00:23:07.080
something similar i use a set of
 

00:23:07.080 --> 00:23:10.860
something similar i use a set of
attributes which I in a separate file

attributes which I in a separate file
 

00:23:10.870 --> 00:23:14.370

00:23:24.590 --> 00:23:24.600
44 now I can add and remove the
 

00:23:24.600 --> 00:23:27.960
44 now I can add and remove the
attributes as I wish it doesn't break

00:23:27.960 --> 00:23:27.970

your your resource identifiers once and
 

00:24:11.079 --> 00:24:14.219
your your resource identifiers once and
just save them off as text constants or

00:24:14.219 --> 00:24:14.229
just save them off as text constants or
 

00:24:14.229 --> 00:24:15.659
just save them off as text constants or
your static finals or something like

like a lot of work um content providers

00:24:35.249 --> 00:24:35.259

you can even use reflection if you know

00:24:39.899 --> 00:24:39.909
you can even use reflection if you know
 

00:24:39.909 --> 00:24:42.149
you can even use reflection if you know
the values of them so you can then

00:24:42.149 --> 00:24:42.159
the values of them so you can then
 

00:24:42.159 --> 00:24:47.189
the values of them so you can then
reflect into the ID database or that the

reflect into the ID database or that the
 

00:24:47.199 --> 00:24:50.279
reflect into the ID database or that the

either is fixed value of the resource
 

00:25:23.229 --> 00:25:27.419
either is fixed value of the resource
already and then actually have no idea

00:25:27.419 --> 00:25:27.429
already and then actually have no idea

the other option I was thinking about

00:25:30.930 --> 00:25:30.940
the other option I was thinking about
 

00:25:30.940 --> 00:25:37.379
the other option I was thinking about
was to a him move back to a actual

horse similar way that's not such a bad
 

00:25:45.940 --> 00:25:48.629

solution really I mean it's not quite as

00:25:48.629 --> 00:25:48.639
solution really I mean it's not quite as
 

00:25:48.639 --> 00:25:50.279

but you know realistically how often do

00:25:53.849 --> 00:25:53.859
but you know realistically how often do
 

00:25:53.859 --> 00:25:55.709
but you know realistically how often do
you have to do it I mean you parse the

00:25:55.709 --> 00:25:55.719
you have to do it I mean you parse the
 

00:25:55.719 --> 00:25:57.419
you have to do it I mean you parse the
XML once when you load the plug-in or

00:25:57.419 --> 00:25:57.429
XML once when you load the plug-in or
 

00:25:57.429 --> 00:25:59.369
XML once when you load the plug-in or
maybe even when you install it and then

00:25:59.369 --> 00:25:59.379
maybe even when you install it and then
 

00:25:59.379 --> 00:26:02.690
maybe even when you install it and then
you're pretty much done I think that

00:26:02.690 --> 00:26:02.700
you're pretty much done I think that
 

00:26:02.700 --> 00:26:05.069
you're pretty much done I think that
it's worth incurring a performance

00:26:05.069 --> 00:26:05.079
it's worth incurring a performance
 

00:26:05.079 --> 00:26:06.370
it's worth incurring a performance

that only happens you know once a day or

00:26:09.490 --> 00:26:09.500
that only happens you know once a day or
 

00:26:09.500 --> 00:26:16.720
that only happens you know once a day or
less okay okay so a you you don't you

00:26:16.720 --> 00:26:16.730
less okay okay so a you you don't you
 

00:26:16.730 --> 00:26:18.670
