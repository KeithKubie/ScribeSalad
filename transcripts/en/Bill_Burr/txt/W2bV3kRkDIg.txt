Um, you know, I, I'm going to be, oh, I'm going back down the rabbit hole. This, this Thursday. I know it's supposed to be about you on Thursdays. Mondays it's about me, but on Thursdays it's supposed to be about you. You know what I mean? You sit there, you sit in there with that Styrofoam Cup drinking a cup of Cho America that don't work without you. Now he's singing those condescending songs to the working man. Hey, gay puts his fucking pants on one leg at a time. Joe. Six pack. Yeah.

Speaker 3:          00:00:56       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:00:57       Goes the track every once in a while has an occasional [inaudible] again, you know, laughs that are racist, choke every 7.2 days. You know, never questions it. Um, yeah, I'm going down the rabbit hole this week cause I, you know, I, I would like a little bit credit after the Superbowl for being a fucking gentleman as a Patriot fan. Okay. And you Bronco fans better know what I'm talking about. I was a gentleman, you know, it's so funny. A lot of you are in chickens. Get your fucking head so far up your fucking bronco is that you don't even know what I'm talking about. You think I'm talking about because you guys kicked my team's ass, right? Not really kicked her ass. Fucking won in the last second. Took the whole fucking game to win. Right. You take that. I'm fucking saying that I was nice that I actually rooted for Peyton manning and the Broncos. Now that's not what I'm talking about. You know what I'm talking about? After tar, Brady went to that fucking to deflate gate thing went to the entire baseball season. Air Pressure. Okay. You know, you would think of, that's what happens with air pressure. What if a certain, someone had a certain something shipped to his certain house? To a certain wife.

Speaker 3:          00:02:18       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:02:19       And that certain someone is in the fucking super bowl, Jesus Christ, if they can make a fucking air pressure in eight months, fucking Goddamn story on ESPN, how long is this thing gonna last answer? Zero seconds wasn't even a fucking story. Okay. And you know what? And I loved that it happened. I love that they didn't make a big fucking deal out of it. You know, cause I don't think they should. I think we're all going to be on roids in the future. In the future. We're all gonna be Jack. Right. And the future, they're going to have like a fucking 80 enrolled or like heavyweight division, you know? Um, sorry, meet the Hershey's cuss. I just had some salty, I apologize. Very rude. You know, I'm just saying what I loved about how that happened is I'm never going to lose another fucking argument that there is a fucking witch hunt or that was a fucking witch hunt.

Speaker 1:          00:03:17       Okay. If you're going to fucking, you know, go fucking ballistic about that Horse Shit, you know, then all somebody has to come out and says, you should, you know, just makes me sheer cool. Oh girl, you where'd she come from? And then that's it. It's over. It's over. Done. I don't know about you guys, but I don't have any more questions. They down place that close the book. Take it off the board. Now the case solved. I'm fucking unbelief. I was a gentlemen. Oh, I was general. Give Up. Not even naming names. You know what I'm talking about? Everyone knows the fuck I'm talking about. I'm just being a fucking gentleman. I'm just a gentleman right now sitting in here and some fucking basketball shorts, eating Hershey kisses. Just talking. Just talking to myself. Oh, I'm having [inaudible]. Who's the fucking annoying content makes Hershey's kisses. I don't fucking get it.

Speaker 3:          00:04:12       Okay,

Speaker 1:          00:04:13       thank God we've made sure that kisses also doesn't make popcorn or you have to fucking unwrap each goddamn colonel. Pop Dry. Am I doing 80 standup right now? Why or would you go do so small? You know, I bet they make bigger ones now for fat fucks. I got to look that up. What should I Google here? The Hershey kiss for a fat fuck. I gotta do it now just to see if something comes up. Do my dog looks so fucking cute right now. She's completely just like, she has her bed and um, nobody fucking lies down on a bed like a dog. Just cause they're pack animals and they don't need their space. They, they, they like being in each other's spaces, laying down on top of each other. She fucking, she's laying there right now. She'll say a fucking lion just laying in a cage. Except she's got a bed and there's no cage. Surely doesn't look like a lion. She's like a dog. She's chilling. That's what I'm trying to say. All right. Alright. I say Hershey. Kiss her. She is the one chocolate I have. All right. Hershey kiss for fat. Fuck.

Speaker 1:          00:05:24       You know there's going to be a hit here. Hershey kisses. This annoys me. Irish people taste test. Hershey kisses.

Speaker 1:          00:05:33       Oh, let me guess. They're going to shit on America's chocolate when the fuck go. Europe is just enough already. You know what I mean? Isn't it enough that we accepted the fact that you stole Blues Music after we stole it and then brought it back to us? We were nice about it. Then we, um, all right, I bet I would supersized supersize Hershey's kits and then, and there's no way they're going to say for fat. Fuck, come on. Let's, let's, let's be intelligence about this. All right. Hershey kiss for a supersize, but then they're not going to be able to say that because McDonald's uses that, right? Supersize which all just means for fat fucks, right?

Speaker 4:          00:06:07       Hm.

Speaker 1:          00:06:07       Kisses giants, milk chocolate, seven ounce package images for her. She kisses [inaudible] super cy. There they are. Oh yeah. You know somebody fucking complaint, you know some fucking [inaudible]. You know as people that breathe like biggie smalls, that kind of out of shape, they have sleep apnea even when they're awake. You know, they called up the Hershey

Speaker 4:          00:06:37       [inaudible] department, please, I want you, if you work so much, okay, you gotta burn so many calories,

Speaker 1:          00:06:46       you know, it's just so fucking gross to him. Like, it was just gross to you that they just said five, five and make them bigger, you know, just imagine how much more aluminum foil that was some poor kid fucking, you know, thrown out his back, picking up those giant chocolate fucking kisses.

Speaker 4:          00:07:04       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:07:04       They're really not that much bigger. Oh fuck. You may have those peanut butter ones. What am I talking about here? Jesus Christ. Let's, let's continue on here. So anyways, um, I am going to have a good time with that. When I go to, I'm actually going to Cheyenne, Wyoming and Denver, Colorado, and uh, all the fun. I'm going to have a Denver wishing them a happy celebration for the Superbowl wind and uh, you know, you know, and I'll have a couple of, you know, choice words to say,

Speaker 4:          00:07:40       okay,

Speaker 1:          00:07:42       and you know what? The best part is as much as if I do, I don't think I'm going to do it, but if I do it as much as they bow and as loud as they do in the back of their heads, they know I'm fucking right. I challenge anyone that you guys send me a fucking email right now and you tell me that there isn't some unbalanced fucking going after the Patriots thing after that fucking horse shit. If the flight date is an eight months story and that fucking thing is eight seconds. Oh, what a gentleman I didn't say shit to. I alluded to it, but I, you know, still not naming names. We had protection issues.

Speaker 1:          00:08:18       That's not a story. Nothing to say. Um, anyway, so I'm going to Wyoming and uh, I drove through it a long time ago and saw these things that look like deer, but I knew they weren't, you know, so I was just like, wow, where the fuck am I even I knew I was in Wyoming, right? This podcast is all over the place. Um, let me, uh, so I looked up Wyoming on Wikipedia. Who's kidding? Who? I went to Wikipedia. I didn't even go to Wikipedia. I just wrote Wyoming. And Wikipedia always, always comes up, right? It's just a great website. You know, you just read a bunch of things about the thing that you looked up and afterwards you feel like you something and then you throw it out at a party and you go, yeah it does. And then eventually you run into somebody that's an expert on it and then you realize halfway through it and then you're like, Yo, I had fuck Yale.

Speaker 1:          00:09:05       And you just walk away during the, uh, the Wikipedia shuffle as you walk away. 20 ways I found out that Wyoming is, um, I bet somebody there named their kid oming, you know their first name Omi, so they can be like Wyoming. How are you doing? Sorry. Jesus. Brutal podcast. All right. This article includes a sortable listing of the United States 50, 50 United States by population density cause I immediately found out that Wyoming, Wyoming is the, um, second least, uh, densely populated state. All right, so here we go. Let me get to the list here. Density, state ranks. Here we go. All right, the top one. What do you think it is now? This is density. This is not population. This is like elbow room. Okay. Density. Uh, the most densely populated state is you'd never guess this and they shoot New Jersey. I never would have guessed that most densely populated was New Jersey.

Speaker 1:          00:10:18       That's cause of all it cons that can't afford to live in Manhattan right along the coast. I think. Then there's Rhode Island. It's a number two. Massachusetts is number three. It's all the small ones on the east coast where the white man first landed, right first started banging away. First said to the native Americans, what do you call that stuff, man? Can you teach us? Right? Four, they took it from them. Um, Connecticut, Maryland, Delaware, New York, Florida, right. Wherever he lose it with a dream from the east coast. Fucking vacations deal with going down to Fort Myers. My cousins has a boat. Uh, Pennsylvania in Ohio, that's the top 10 most densely populated. I was surprised. California was 11 was not in the top 10. Granted, I live in Los Angeles. All right. Least populated state. What do you guess? What do you got? What do you got? Alaska. All right, here we go.

Speaker 1:          00:11:20       Is the top the least populated from number 10 all the way down to number one, number one being the least densely populated. All right. Kansas, Nevada and Nebraska. Idaho, New Mexico, South Dakota, North Dakota, Montana. Wow. I mean in Alaska. So there you go. In generally speaking, I guess we are a not a very densely populated country and a, you know, you'd think I would notice that the amount of traveling I've done, the only time I really noticed it was when I went to Asia and I was like, Jesus Christ, there's a of fucking people over here. You know? That's all you do when you go to Asia. Go holy fucking shit. Look at all these. Look, they fucking just look at all these apartment buildings. Look at them all. They're all filled. There's laundry hanging out every window. Um, isn't it amazing that there's a billion people in China and they all have shirts?

Speaker 1:          00:12:12       Have you ever fucking thought about stuff like that? Like who the fuck made all those shirts you take with all those fucking pee, all those shirts that needed to be made. What do you think that you would know? Somebody that makes shirts. I don't know anybody in the clothing industry yet. Everybody, everybody in the fucking, that's unbelievable. As much as many rollerblades as they sold, right? Everybody didn't have them, but everybody's got a shirt, right? Everybody's got to cover up the junk. Even the strippers, even strippers have to walk out with some clothes right before they take it off. All right. This article is about the u s state. Wyoming. Wyoming is a state in their mountain region of West, so we know all this shit, the United States, but booboo, popo populates a, where the fuck is it? Come on. The Western two thirds of the state is covered mostly with the mountain ranges and the range lands in the foothills of the eastern rocky mountains is has God's country here. While the eastern third of the state is high plank, high elevation prairie, known as the high plains. Cheyenne is the capital in the most populous city in Wyoming with the population estimate of this is the most populated city

Speaker 1:          00:13:22       in Wyoming, a population of 62,448 people as of 2013 62,448 people. Do you realize what a let them that that is, that's a dream.

Speaker 3:          00:13:39       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:13:40       It's a dream. You know what the sad thing is? Most people like myself, I would go there and I would go crazy because there was nothing to do. Look at these fucking pictures. It's all the second Clint Eastwood movie. You don't know. Oh my God. Look at the sunset. Yeah. I'd go out of my mind here. Jesus Christ.

Speaker 3:          00:14:02       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:14:03       It's fucking unreal. I mean at the have you run to a native American that it doesn't even know that they lost, right?

Speaker 3:          00:14:09       Yeah.

Speaker 1:          00:14:10       Like back in the day when those Japanese soldiers stayed on the fucking islands, it kept fighting. World War Two is old faithful there. Yellowstone. Yellowstone is in fucking Wyoming. I never knew that. Oh Man. I wish I had the time. I would drive all the way up there on the John d Rockefeller Jr memorial parkway. I would go all the way up there.

Speaker 3:          00:14:33       [inaudible]

Speaker 1:          00:14:34       why I'm asking me a fucking amazing state. This is all like fucking like, like the people that live there. You got the regular people that are from their generations, generations of people that you know first went across the country and had the balls to pull up stakes from east coast and go west and a didn't have the balls to continue. Like all those real men that settled in San Francisco, in Los Angeles, particularly Hollywood. They stayed there. Right. And then what you have now is you have rich Fox and a rich Fox meaning just like business people and then uh, celebrities, celebrities, a big on going out there and buying someplace where they can just get away and clear their head, you know, become a singer songwriter, wherever the fuck it is they want to do. I'd like to do that Shit, man. I'd like to fucking rent a log cabin out there. But like one of those, it looks like a log cabin from the outside, but on the inside it looks like a house. Right. Like an updated one, not a real one with a dirt floor, you know, so grizzly bear sticking his face through the fucking kitchen window. Like there is a kitchen that's just a fireplace. Right.

Speaker 4:          00:15:46       Fuck all that. You know what I mean?

Speaker 1:          00:15:51       I, I, you know something, this is what, you know what I always enjoyed most about fucking skiing cause this time of year, I'm sure there's great skiing. Uh, even with global warming, right? Which we're not causing evidently from the documentaries that I watched, I didn't watch him. I just saw the links and I was just like, you know, I'm too fucking busy. I'm too busy. I'm staying with the, I'm staying with my life, you know? Um, well the thing that I like most about skiing is after skiing and going down to the lodge and sitting by the fire and getting shit faced, you know, the whole skiing itself and worrying that I'm going to blow out my knee. I fucking hate skiing, man. I respect the hell out of it. I think it's an amazing workout. But like a, I should take a lesson. I never took a lesson.

Speaker 1:          00:16:31       I was like, I can skate. Right. And I just started going down the blue square ones, right? Then of course you know your ego, then it's black diamond, double black diamond. I don't wear a helmet. It's really fucking dumb and I don't know how to fall and whatever I do, one knee goes one way, one goes the other way and it's just like, you know what I should just do, I should just buy all the ski ship Shit minus the fucking poles in the skis and then just go do cardio like a fucking maniac for two hours. Okay. Then I put all the ski shit on a roll around on the snow and then I come walking into the lodge and just say I went down some quadruple black diamond. I would like an IPA night. And then I sit there, a couple of snow bunnies come walking up, right little have she have fun and I'm in there. Um, but that's not going to happen. I'm just going to go to Cheyenne and tell some shit jokes. That's what's going to happen. You know what sucks is I'm barely into that beautiful state, mark my words. At some point I'm going to a, I've got to do a tour,

Speaker 4:          00:17:30       uh,

Speaker 1:          00:17:32       you know, of all I, you know, go from fucking Wyoming over to Nebraska, up through the Dakotas, through Montana, down through fucking Idaho, back over to Yellowstone. And then I'll fucking hit home. I had to do one of those fucking runs. That'd be a fun one. Cost a fucking fortunate gas. It'd be fucking city. There's like nine, eight hours, nine hour dries between each of them. I run into some comics that have done those runs out there. Dude, that is not for the fucking faith of heart. I can tell you that right now. But, um, I'm definitely going to do that. You know, I'm psyched cause I haven't, I haven't been in Nebraska in a long fucking time. I used to all of those things. I was just watching better call Saul and when they, when name and some of the cities, you know, I was going like, I fucking know those Hays Grand Junction.

Speaker 1:          00:18:19       I bend to all of those. That's on route 80. Route 80 goes through Nebraska. I'm sorry, what the fuck am I talking about? Let's, let's back up here for a second. Oh, freckles flew yesterday in the helicopter. I flew with my instructor by and we flew all the way up to Santa Barbara and came back and um, was fucking incredible. And I went along the coastline the whole way. I was trying to get a, a a three point. Um, I needed 3.4 on the Hobbs me to have 100 hours right. And uh, ended up getting a 2.9 cause we had a tailwind and I also took the coasts back rather than going along the one-on-one and down the four oh five, but just was too beautiful. Did Not do it. And on the way back, um, you go over this, uh, navy airstrip, which is restricted area, but if, you know, if they don't have any planes coming in, they let you fly over it.

Speaker 1:          00:19:17       So we were flying along the coast of it and they let us go in and they said, you know, and then they came back on the radio and they said they had a couple of planes coming in to basically keep your eye out for it. And of course my instructor finds him first and I look, I go, dude, I only see one. Where's the other one? Where's the other one? Where's the other one? I'm like, freaking out. He goes, no, they're like fucking those FAA teens, they fly like really close together. And sure enough when they turned the corner there was like two of them. And they do this fucking sick ass approach that they do is they come in right turn base and turned final. And as they come in, right, one of them peels away. Neither one of them lands on the first pass.

Speaker 1:          00:19:55       They fly right over the runway. One of them does a tight circle. And the other does a bigger circle and then they just fucking one lands and the other one comes in right in and after them it's fucking and say what was funny was the tower was going on once the other hotel that keep a traffic in sight. And I'm like, yeah, keeping traffic at site once Sierra hotel. And then I'm like going like, like I could do anything if that fucking thing was coming at me. Like this thing was like in like a f, like not even like a Lamborghini. He's like in a Ferrari, not a fry me enough to fucking Batmobile. Right. Whatever. It's more like one of those land speed fucking things they have out there in the, uh, the, the Salt Lake, whatever the fuck the salt flats, the fucking salty dirt out there in Utah.

Speaker 1:          00:20:39       And I'm in this fucking, I was basically in a Chevy Chevette. Like if it came at me, like, what was I going to do other than be like, and then that would have been what a way to go. Um, but when we were coming back down, um, we got to a point on the, a lot of geography in this one. We got along at this point on the California coast, which is called, uh, I think, I think dunes point. I'd never flown up there before. And um, there's a sick ass fucking house there, right as you go up there. It's got like a fucking a pool that's shaped like a fucking cutlass. Oh, like a sword. And we will looking at that as it, as we came down a little bit further, um, we saw something splashing in the water and we looked down and it was a whale coming up by breaching, I believe is what you call it.

Speaker 1:          00:21:28       And we did a little loop around, I got some video, I'll put that up there. Um, it was fucking amazing. And then there's just this point, I think maybe it's, maybe that was further up. I think it was further up north when we came around dunes point. Like all of a sudden you could start to see lax and then Santa Monica, Culver City, and then downtown La is one of the most beautiful flights that I've been on. But the big thing was, um, I flew by lax and I made all the radio calls, which is, you know, Bravo airspaces I've mentioned before, and that's like the shit where I'm, you need explicit permission to go into that airspace where they have to read your whole fucking tail number. And, uh, I dunno, it's like you feel like you're fucking talking to God when you talk to those guys.

Speaker 1:          00:22:14       So I had rehearsed the radio call like fucking 30 times on the drive down. And, uh, I was able to say it with enough confidence, um, that he didn't sound too much like an asshole. And, um, and he let us go through and it was kind of anticlimactic. I had really built it up in my fucking head. But anyway, so I went back, I got a 2.9, so old freckled says 99.5, um, 99.5 hours. So, uh, I was supposed to fly today but I was tired and I don't fuck around doing that shit. I'm just like, yeah, I'm feeling tired. I'm not feeling it. Fuck it. Um, so anyways, another thing that I was looking up is, uh, is beautiful as these states are, you know, that I've been going to all of these states that people, you know, consider fly overstates and fucking what the fuck goes on there.

Speaker 1:          00:23:00       You know, just shitting all over him even though they're absolutely gorgeous and there's great people out there is um, you know, just to the drug use and that type of shit is really fucking bad. The heroin man, everywhere I go is this fucking heroin problem. And they keep linking it back to these, uh, you know, people having an injury, I saw this on real sports. People have an injury and then they get like whatever they get the fucking, was it percosets Viking and I don't know what the fuck it is. Oxy and that shit. And then when that runs out, they still want that high and heroin is cheaper. And it's just like, you know, once again, once again you would think, you know, with all this shit of talking about terrorism, you know, and people doing shit to this country for some reason, you can fuck with the food supply and you can get your own countrymen addicted to heroin.

Speaker 1:          00:23:47       And as long as you've got enough fucking money, nobody gives a shit. It's completely flag. Isn't that like an act of terrorism? Am I out of my fucking mind? How can you do that to fellow Americans? You'll ruin people's lives. It's fucking brutal. But it's one of the reasons why I stay out of the politics shit. You know, every once in awhile I look at this stuff and it just, I dunno, it's like overwhelmingly depressing, you know, like, um, I saw us up to the other day on, uh, for some reason I was looking up Chelsea Clinton cause I saw her on TV with Hillary and Hillary was giving a speech.

Speaker 5:          00:24:21       Yeah. [inaudible]

Speaker 1:          00:24:25       right. And I was literally going like, there's no fucking way I can listen to that voice for four fucking years. I just can't, I am not against a woman being president whatsoever, but you cannot sound like somebody's learning how to play a trumpet, Dee. I just, I don't give us, you could have all the answers to the fucking universe. There is no fee. Can't hear what she's saying.

Speaker 5:          00:24:47       Yeah, yeah.

Speaker 1:          00:24:53       You know, my dog's looking at me right now. Like, really? Um, so anyways, so I looked up and I was just going like, how old is she now? And when I started out in comedy, she was just a kid. And, um, you know, she was at that awkward age and it was kind of this nice unwritten rule, you know, you did make fun of her wishing that fucking awkward age. Right. I was like, was she like 12 or something like that? And, uh, I went to go look it up. You know how old she was final, she was in her thirties, which fucking blew my mind, even though obviously it was 20 years ago. Right. But, um, what killed me is what I saw was they had a stat on our wedding. Do you know our parents fucking through are a $3 million wedding.

Speaker 3:          00:25:33       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:25:34       Like these politicians is so fucking dishonest. They don't even try to hide it. It's like, how the fuck could you afford a $3 million wedding? The most money, either one of you ever made in public service was, was being president, which was 400 grand of fucking year. Dude, you make 400 fucking grand a year. They're going to whack you in half. You're going to maybe walk with 200, right? Nowadays probably less than that. Probably one 95. What the fuck are you getting off playing for a fucking

Speaker 3:          00:26:07       [inaudible]?

Speaker 1:          00:26:08       You got a fucking $3 million wedding house on fucking math is vineyard. Give me a fucking break. These cars go around, right? All right, got another Hershey's kiss my mom. So you know I'm playing them true. Um, these guys go around. They just give speeches and his wife two 53 in a grand a fucking whack. Just giving speeches. Can you imagine paying a trainer? Granted, listen, sunny for an hour ago,

Speaker 5:          00:26:40       right, right.

Speaker 1:          00:26:41       For a fucking hour. Now you got sickly Clinton with that awful face lifted he got, which just made his head look fucking huge. You know, he's lost all that weight and he got it. You got a chin, whatever the fuck he did to his chin, he yanked that fucker back. He looked like a bobble head version of himself and I'll tell you, his shit's Yag back so tidy. Can't even clap anymore. You know what I mean? Either that or that's his true failings about his wife. Right. What you can't blame, you really can't blame Bill Clinton for going out and taking a cigar and putting it in that woman. You know what I mean? If like that's what he's laying next to his bed. I mean I, you know, Jesus Christ, if I was married to Hillary Clinton, she would have to have, you know, those, those surgical masks that Asian people wear when they get sick, cause they don't want to get anybody else sick cause they're fucking courteous or because it's like nine zillion people that live next door. They get turned into an epidemic. I don't fucking know why they do it. Right. I would make her wear one of those all the time because maybe then she'd sound like a muted trumpet. Right. And every once in a while she'd hit a couple of notes that remind me of a miles Davis song and then maybe I could just stop myself from strangling her in the fucking Oval Office.

Speaker 4:          00:28:00       Yeah.

Speaker 1:          00:28:04       She reminds me like an animal that like is getting eaten alive. You know, you ever hear that? Like, just like time I saw that fucking monkey, that other monkey alive just digging meat out of its back. And he's like, you know, it's sort of like, not as sharp but not as quick as that.

Speaker 4:          00:28:22       Um,

Speaker 1:          00:28:23       anyways, and they fucking that, that Bernie Sanders guys with his fucking [inaudible]. You look at Bro, you know, you wonder why Bill Clinton got a fucking face lift and then you, yeah, you're fucking, you got his neck done. Then you look at Bernie Sanders, you're like, oh, that's why Jesus Christ, he looks like a fucking, he looks like a bloodhound eating a fucking Turkey dinner, jowls flopping all around. We go, you're in a federal job. All right. All of these guys that Jerry Jersey guy looks all fat, then everybody else just looks like an extra to me. Granted, I have not listened to one fucking word. Any of them have said, but it's a, it's going to be interesting. Oh really? Bill, you think it's going to be interesting, a presidential election that might Pique your interest? You have freckled arrogant country.

Speaker 4:          00:29:14       Um, anyways, so,

Speaker 2:          00:38:35       [inaudible]

Speaker 6:          00:39:23       I never know about. I do now. Valentine's Day advice. Billy boy, dear his billion. I know this is last minute. I had a question about Valentine's Day. I am a single guy in my mid twenties rejoice, dude, I'm going to tell you right now, if you're a single guy in your mid twenties and you live in America and you're living on your own, please

Speaker 6:          00:39:51       dropped to your knees and thank whatever gods you pray to every day because you're never going to be free or in your life. I know you've probably got student loans at Blah, blah, blah, the stress and all that bullshit. Fuck that. Okay? Do you never going to be freer in your life? Go get three years supplies of condoms, okay, and bang away my friend. Maybe you don't need to do it for three years. Maybe you're one of those guys for only three weeks, but you need to get it out of your system. All right? He says, I never really had a girlfriend for whatever reason. Oh, Jesus Christ. All right, we're gone the whole other other way. Truth be told, my friends could name numerous reasons why I don't have a girlfriend, but that's an entirely different issue. What? Jesus Christ, there's a fucking can of worms.

Speaker 2:          00:40:39       They can.

Speaker 6:          00:40:42       You don't seem defensive or argumentative. So I don't know if it's an anger issue that, look, I'm, I'm so sick of trying to be fucking Hannibal Lecter here. Trying to guess what your shoes look like with w with the way you write, you know. All right. I'm just gonna read the rest of the shit. Uh, as of right now, I am currently sleeping with three girls off of, see you fucking, you'll get knocking it out. I thought you'd like never had a girlfriend like, and you've never banged anybody. Alright. My fault.

Speaker 2:          00:41:08       All right.

Speaker 6:          00:41:11       Do go fuck yourself. You're a guy in your mid twenties and you fucking three girls right now and I'm on this. You need advice? I keep doing what you're doing. Um, anyways, depending on what day of the week it is and how much I've drank. Okay. That depends on how many girls he's paying it. I've never lied to any of the, any of any of them about where our relationship is going. And although they never met each other, each of them has an idea that I'm seeing other girls. It's kind of a don't ask, don't tell policy. Um, yeah, dude and I, you got to come with that. You know, you can open with that, you know, what are you doing? I'm dating, I'm playing the field. I mean, people you're dating right now. A couple of people kind of seeing just having a good time. Well, I don't do stuff like that.

Speaker 6:          00:41:59       Well there's the door sweetheart then they'll respect like that. The honesty of that. Some won't, some will actually have self esteem and walked out, but a lot of them they'll hang around eventually that if tired their neck gets weak and they'll fall right in your fucking Dick. Um, birthdays and Christmas are always a piece of cake because all that requires a quick text or a phone call or at the very most drinks at the bar. But Valentine's Day is tricky. Our dates consist of bar hopping and drunk sex. So flowers and a nice dinner would completely send the wrong message. Dude, you selfish Kahn? Are you asking me how to keep banging these three chicks while getting through Valentine's Day? Why don't you just look at the Valentine's Day like that's your pussy getting all star break. Just take three days off the day before the day after on the day of just say, uh, what are you doing for Valentine's Day? Um, uh, I'm going to be a Jesus. Where are you going to be? I don't, you know, I don't have a good one for that one. All right. You know what? I just put myself in your shoes and I understand your problem now. You said I got to do a little bit of trouble. Last year one of the girls texted me and said, you know, every girl likes flowers on Valentine's Day.

Speaker 6:          00:43:14       He said, I knew my response couldn't be. Yeah, but if I get you flowers done, I have to get you flowers for all the other girls. So I just post out and responded. Yeah, well, oh dude, you shouldn't responded at all.

Speaker 1:          00:43:28       You know, every girl likes to give flowers on Valentine's Day. Isn't that funny? And that has nothing to do with most likely her having any sort of feelings towards you. It's just the bitch next to her. And the other cubicle probably got some, you know why the girl on their fucking, whatever the fuck you want to call it. Some guy broke my balls this week was fucking hilarious. He was trashing me say come off as a pompous ass because I always talk about anybody who doesn't do comedy works in a cubicle, you know? And for some reason he decided to take that seriously and tell me that he actually works at the u n and travels all around the world.

Speaker 7:          00:44:05       Okay.

Speaker 6:          00:44:09       If that's actually true. Sarah, why don't you just get on with doing that? You work at the UN and you travel all over the world. Why would you give a fuck what some absolute jackass. You say it on a fucking podcast. How insecure are you? Your insecurities? Probably a great thing cause that's probably the thing that drove you to be at the UN where you travel all around the world. You know what sir? Good for you. That's awesome. I hope working at the UN and traveling all around the world fills you up some point where it fills you up high enough where you don't have to respond to a silly joke on some dumb ass podcast. Um, I travel all around the world. Um, you know what? That's actually a great fucking job. Do you feel like you get anything done? You know, do you sit there wearing that headpiece next to that guy who's wearing the water buffalo hat? I buy their beer at the above doing that shit. And you're sitting there trying to talk to him about how you can sell your rich crackers. Did their country, is that what you're doing when you're traveling? All around the where I travel all around the world.

Speaker 6:          00:45:25       I can just see you on the plane with the of fucking dress socks on. You have a dash cunt. Oh, just sitting there or what movies am I gonna Watch on this flight as I travel all around the world? Um, anyways.

Speaker 3:          00:45:41       Yeah.

Speaker 6:          00:45:41       You know something sir? You had you, you had the James Bond job and then you fucking, you played yourself. I don't know why you did that. Why would you fucking, that's like me responding to people on Twitter. Why would I do it? I should pretend like I have better things to do. Um, anyways, I want to keep seeing all these girls back to this guy, but this, but at the same time, I don't want any broken hearts on Valentine's Day. Oh two. You know what? Go [inaudible]. I don't know. What is your problem here, dude? Yeah. You like a Gemini. It's like you're this fucking lady killer. Then also you kind of like you how you want to hurt anybody. She, I get her some jam jams. I can't even, I won't talk to the fucking UN guy. What the hell was going on here again? Valentine's Day got a little trouble as you, well listen, you're anticipating trouble. Didn't you learn anything from last year? You know, every girl likes flowers on Valentine's Day.

Speaker 3:          00:46:34       Okay.

Speaker 6:          00:46:36       Um, what, what would I write back? I know what my response would be. The second I read that if it was just some girl I was banging and then they wrote that I would get this awful feeling in my stomach and I would, I would read it and as I got that awful feeling, I'd go and make that noise.

Speaker 3:          00:46:57       Yeah.

Speaker 6:          00:46:58       You know that thing like when you're just banging a girl and then all of a sudden she just fucking makes that comment. You know, you think she's on the same page as you. When did, she just makes that comment, you know, I was thinking about you today. You just feel that feeling in your stomach. Yes. Oh yeah. Well a don't fucking worst. Ah, you gotta be one and done, but one had done is scary. You just gotta be honest. I don't know if some girls, what would I say? You know, every girl likes flowers on Valentine's Day.

Speaker 6:          00:47:35       Um, what would I text back? Yeah. You know, that's what I heard. You know what I, you know when I shouldn't give you shit, I don't have a good response to that. Well, maybe someday you'll meet a guy who wants to give you some, you want to get drunk and fuck. Um, and I got nothing and you can't ignore it. You know what I would've done? I would've ignored the text and I would have called her, but a good three hours later, three, four hours, three hours later, that's a good one. You call her, you ignore that text and then you call and she goes hell hour. And they're like, hey, what's going on? What are you doing tonight? I got no plans Valentine's Day. What are you doing? He just started with that and then she, well, what are you at it there? And she'll be seen. If you're going to take it in some romantic,

Speaker 1:          00:48:22       you know, direction and you don't, you just keep it in the fuck buddy.

Speaker 6:          00:48:28       I figured we'd go down to our meet hammers or whatever the fuck we go down to. Uh, take it the face and have a couple pitchers of beer and see what happens. Dude, you know what? You're, you're, it seems to me you're not just fucking these girls. You're actually having like these mini relationships with them. You know the, the key to having a fuck buddy is, is the time between fucking them. And I don't give a shit how much a woman says that she can handle it. Most of them can't. Most of them can't. If you fucking come on over there and you, and it just, eventually they're going to get feelings. They're more, I don't know if they're more mature or if it's a defect. It's just, I just respect the fact that that's how they're wired. So if you have a fuck buddy, okay, let's, let's just do the math. Okay, now, now, February is a very short month here. So let's just say right out of the gate, you fucker on February 2nd all right? You shouldn't come around again til at least the 17th and progress. You Fuck and you leave

Speaker 1:          00:49:43       f and l,

Speaker 6:          00:49:45       you fuck them and then you leave. You don't bang her on the SEC. You Bang around the second and then you bang her on the seventh. You're in a fucking relationship in their world.

Speaker 1:          00:49:53       You know,

Speaker 6:          00:49:56       unless you, literally this second you have an orgasm as you're coming, you're scooping up your clothes and you walk out like half naked, then you just bizarre is another good way to keep them at bay. And why don't I just read the rest of the, to see what his question is here. He says, I want to keep seeing all these girls, but at the same time I don't want to Bray, I don't want any broken hearts on Valentine's Day. Yeah, you want to keep fucking all of them now do what you have to have. You have to have a road involving door. You have to have a stable of women if you're going to this life or you have to give into fucking rubbing one out. All right? But you can't be a relationship guy with three different women cause you are going to end up hurting them.

Speaker 6:          00:50:35       So what you have to constantly be doing, you gotta be like a college coach. All right? Every year you lose some top prospects, but you're out there recruiting. Okay. See you. So you maintain, but it's never ending. It's fucking exhausting. But if that's the game you want to play, that's what you have to do. So that girl who says, you know, every girl likes flowers on Valentine's Day right there, you put on waivers, okay, for a fucking piece of ass to be named later, you got, you got to get rid of her. Okay. And you got to look, go back and analyze what the fuck you did wrong that she felt it was okay for her to text you cause you fucked up. That right there shows that you fucked up, that she felt that she could send that to you if you think you're just fucked buddies.

Speaker 6:          00:51:26       All right? So anyways, he continues. He says, I know that like it or not, this shit is important to women. If I take one girl out, I'm playing favorites and setting a bad precedent. Plus if she does that check in Shit on Facebook, I'm completely fucked. Yeah Dude, you're doing dirtbag shit. If you're a single guy and something could happen that fucks you on Facebook, you're leaving these girls on anyways. He says, if I take none of them out or do nothing, I have three irritable ladies on my hand. Dude, are you going to marry any of them now? Well then let them go. Why don't you have the balls to do that? You know, when a team halfway through the season just realized their weight went in this shit, just pull a fucking Marlin's. Just get rid of everybody and then your fan base is your Dick and they're going to, he's going to be pissed for awhile. Um, but then you build it back up again. Build it back up again. You know, I dunno, look to it. If you want to be in a fucking relationship, you know, there's other ways about going about and doing this, but you're trying to have your cake and eat it. Um, told you, get you, you got three women right now, you're banging in three different women. Where's your confidence? You know what you're doing.

Speaker 4:          00:52:50       All right.

Speaker 6:          00:52:53       Dump to keep one at bay and then get two more. Then dump the other one and get the other ones. You see them. You don't even dump them. You just phase him out, phase him out. But the new recruits that you get in, you gotta be straight up honest with them. You know, unless you actually feel failure, if you're feeling no failings, you know, don't keep coming back fucking them. Unless you know, you get that 15 day, you fuck them on the second you fuck them on the 17th,

Speaker 6:          00:53:22       then you're into March and then bang her on like the 11th. All right? And even then, they can't catch feelings doing that. But before you know it, you know, that's like 14, 15 days out of the year taken up while you, well, you got to bag somebody. This is such, this is a, this is really should be eye opening to women that I'm actually saying this is really, uh, this is really awful that I'm speaking this out loud. Um, he says, in a perfect world, I'll take all of them out at once and have the force and I've been chasing after my entire life, but we don't always get what we want. Any advice from the lovely neo would be much appreciated as well. Love the podcast. Go Fuck Yourself. Uh,

Speaker 2:          00:54:03       yeah, she probably wouldn't have been is a understanding is I was even going to give you a lot of shifts. [inaudible] [inaudible] I've been asking some of the ladies to Reagan and uh, finally,

Speaker 6:          00:55:12       I haven't even read this yet, but this already seems like goals. This is, this is the, the and the subject line of this email. It says, I think the guy I'm dating is a pussy. Hello Bill. I am a 21 year old student. I began listening to your podcast recently and I heard you complaining about how women have not written in, in awhile and being a woman myself decided to do so and asks you for advice. Well, God bless you. Uh, I live at home with my mom and go to college. I recently found a very nice guy. Uh, they were at college and was really into them, but then I started suspecting something strange. I started suspecting that maybe he was a pussy. At first I thought it was pretty harmless, but then one night we had a house party and everyone was pretty drunk. And a friend of mine who I haven't seen in a while was there and when everyone was way, way, way past drunk, she tried to get into a fight with me and eventually pushed me down the wall, then stole my iPhone and he was there and did nothing.

Speaker 6:          00:56:25       Jesus Christ. I was so scared that I called my ex to come get me any did.

Speaker 8:          00:56:32       Wow.

Speaker 6:          00:56:35       Right. You think you're dating a pussy? I mean that right there g and he just stood there and let this other guy who used to hook up with you come in riding in on his white horse. Anyways, my ex was more of a man than the guy was dating now even though the guy I'm dating was drunk, I felt like he should have protected me or done something, anything. He did nothing and later he even confessed to me that he was scared of my drunk friend and even scared of me. What the fuck? Right. Even though he says this will never happen again. I have enough knowledge to know that people do do not usually change like that, you know? That's really wise that you're really wise for your age at 21, if you, if you are already not buying into the, I'm gonna Change, that's a, you're, you're wise beyond your years.

Speaker 6:          00:57:27       You know, they say that your, basically, your psychological makeup is done by the time you're three. So if you see some little toddler standing there while somebody is taking his blocks, that kid's going to be a pussy anyway. So should I be upset or give him another chance? Is this a deal breaker? Is there no way to change a guy from a pussy to a real man? Should I just break off things off with him and if so, should I remain friends with him? Thanks bill. And I hope you read this. Uh, I love you in the Oh, that's nice. Um, all right. This is the deal. Uh, you ask a question, is there no way to change a guy from a pussy to a real man? No, I don't think. I think that that happens. I think it happens way more in movies where somebody has a life changing moment.

Speaker 8:          00:58:22       Uh,

Speaker 6:          00:58:24       and then they just decide I'm not going to take shit anymore. But even then, that just begins the journey of not being a pussy. You don't just say, I'm not going to be a pussy and then Bam, you're not a pussy anymore. You have to, you got to work your way up. It's like if you were a hundred pounds overweight and you're like this, I'm done. I'm not eating fucking ice cream anymore. The next day you don't have a six pack, you know, takes a fucking year or something. You really gotta turn it around. So, um, I dunno, what are you looking for in a guy? I mean, I think the fact that you're writing me and you're saying, I think the guy I'm dating is a pussy. I mean that, that actually hurts me on some level just because I insert myself into this story and the person I'm dating would be calling me a pussy or it could be the ex, I guess. I don't know. This isn't about me. This is about you. Come up, you'll stop being selfish. All right. Um, I think you've totally lost respect for this guy. And if you don't respect the person you're with, eventually you're going to blow somebody else. You know, if you don't break up with this guy, that's what I'm predicting. If you don't break up with this guy, you just going to cheat on him just to facilitate getting out of the relationship because uh,

Speaker 6:          00:59:40       you know, to get to that ll cool j moment, we can just be fucking on us. But I don't think you'd like that when something about you knowing that people don't change your age and the fact that you like, you know, this guy's a pussy, he's not sticking up for me. And the fact that he didn't stick up for you and then you took charge and say, well I'm going to fucking call somebody who will,

Speaker 6:          01:00:01       I mean technically you should have fucked your ex boyfriend that night and he, and he shouldn't have been mad. He should have been like Eddie probably wouldn't have been cause he's a pussy. Ain't I stared, oh man. You know when you needed a big swinging dick. I mean, God knows it wasn't me. So, uh, yeah. Um, I think if you don't break up with this guy, you're actually fighting nature. All right? And you guys are wired to too, I know you guys aren't wired to just have kids with pussies. You know what I mean? You want a strong son, right? You know, like, you know what that Pussy DNA and your kid, right? Oh, that's going to kill you. Imagine that you have a kid with this guy and you want this kid to be like a, like your ex boyfriend and it comes down and it's like this fucking little wormy worm guy.

Speaker 6:          01:00:55       Ah, that'd be awful. Walking down the aisle to marry this guy with dead sheepish. [inaudible] you do you know what? That you want this guy to be the man standing down there in a white Tuxedo, like fucking Roger Moore on James Bond. I think. I think, uh, look, I don't know if this just happened and you're really upset. So, uh, you know, and like, and in three days you're not going to care and you're going to go back to having a picnic with this guy because for all I know, your ex who came coming back, maybe you broke up with him because he cheated on you. Maybe he was too much of a guy, if you know what I mean.

Speaker 6:          01:01:34       So then you said, well, all right, I'm gonna. Maybe I'm this next time I'm dating a nice guy to now you dated a nice guy. The thing about is sometimes you'd date a nice guy. They can be so nice that they're pussies. All right? And look, I'm not, I'm not sitting there acting like, you know, if I'm out with my girl in some fucking 200 pounds, 300 pounds, Jack fucking 25 year old comes up and starts doing shit, then I'm going to start swinging because I'm not, I'm not, I'm not getting my fucking head kicked in just for the fuck of it now. You know what I mean? I mean, it's not like just, you know, straight across the board as a guy, you have to fucking go and get your Goddamn head kicked in. But this was a fucking woman. This was a, I mean he's Jesus.

Speaker 6:          01:02:22       It is a weird situation in defense of him where, how do you get the fucking iPhone back? You start wrestling with her and now you're kind of fucking throwing a girl around so you're looking at that possible assault charge cause God knows that's how the world worked. Works right now. Your honor. I was trying to steal a phone and he, that this guy is salted me and you're going to be sitting there going, she was stealing of phone and then not gonna be able to get past your, you're a guy and she's a girl. But um, yeah, he should have just, he should've just held her by the back of her pants so she couldn't leave and just stayed out of reach of her swinging.

Speaker 6:          01:03:07       That's what you do. If you're in that situation as that guy, you just reached out, you grabbed by the back of your pants and you just start running in a circle until cops get there. So they can't swing at Ya. That running backwards. I mean, I don't know what you, you gotta you gotta fucking do something and he didn't do anything. That's the big thing. If you told them, honestly, if you told me that this was some giant guy who could kick the shit out of him, uh, I wouldn't say that the guy's a pussy. You know what I mean? I mean, what is the point of going and getting a concussion? Getting your tooth driven up through your fucking nose. The Guy Still gonna leave with your phone. You know that said old, uh, Richard Pryor. Bit Macho, man. I'll take that knife and stick it up your ass macho man.

Speaker 6:          01:03:50       It's like, no, you're going to get the shit kicked out of you. But this was a woman. Alright. Pill for fuck sakes. Quit. You have God damn rambling. Wrap it up. Um, I think you know what you want to do when you should do it. Um, you are dating a pussy. The fact that when he was sober, he said that he was scared of her and have you, uh, he seems like he's a little for clamped and uh, I just can't imagine there's going to be a stereotype, but a guy like that actually putting it on you in the bedroom. I really don't. He probably stares at you in the eye. Am I hurting you? Is Everything okay? God, you're so beautiful. I mean, come on right. Flip her over. What's your face in the pillows? I'm always, she says in ps, don't worry. Uh, that con I used to call a friend who pushed me and took my phone is no longer in my life. She gets your phone back. Well, what happened with you guys? Now wait a minute. What can I hear the followup here? There's so many different ways that this could be gone. Was that like a girl? Like when you thought that maybe you were a swinging another way and now all of a sudden you broke up with her and

Speaker 2:          01:04:58       a problem. [inaudible]

Speaker 6:          01:05:46       anyway, I got them into the biggest, dumbest fucking fight last night with my girl, right? We had this great day, you know, everything's going great. So I stay in, I take a night off from comedy and I say, Hey, why don't we watch, why don't we watch your movie? You know what I mean? Cap Off this wonderful fucking day. Everything's going great. What could go wrong? This is like the beginning of a horror movie where they just show like the perfect family and everything's great and people are wearing like white linen, you know? And then all of a sudden they just start showing the camera in the bushes, like a POV of like Mike Meyers. This is basically what happens. So 60 minutes comes on, right? Who doesn't want to watch that show and pretend they're smart? You know, I like it some more that Morley safer comes on and you know, we smells like an old person.

Speaker 6:          01:06:35       Some old people don't smell like old people, but he looks like he smells like an old person, you know, smells of cigars, ash trays, you know, a couple of wars, maybe a date rape. Um, so he's interviewing Meryl Streep, all right. The Great Meryl Streep, and they're going through all our old oral frigging life and all the movies and all the different characters that she's played. Oh, first of all, they start, they start the report off with Morley safer just sitting there, right smelling of fucking Ben Gay in Whiskey, right? And, uh, he says, how, you know how over in England, you know, they, you know, I dunno, they make their, their actors, they, they award them by calling them Lords and they knight them. But over here at America, all we do is just give them the shiny statue and it's just like, starts off right off the bat for some reason, just shitting on America.

Speaker 6:          01:07:35       I don't know why. Like an Oscar is somehow beneath sir, uh, Anthony Michael Hall. I mean, or, or Lord, what Lord of what, what are, what, at least you can fucking hold our statue, your lord of what kingdom, that phony horse shit that you have with Prince Charles in the popper or whatever the fuck is going on over there. You know, look, if the Rothschilds knight you over there, then that fucking means something. Then you can come become part of their yacht convoy as they go around the world figuring out how to take over another currency, right? Then you're in with them. Okay. But if you're, if you're fucking, you know, Lord of this and you're, your wing man is the Duke of Elton John. I mean, it's a whole thing is fucking stupid, right? So right off the bat, it's already bugging me. But I know Nia hates when I talk to the TV, right?

Speaker 6:          01:08:30       So, you know, I keep my big fucking Yap shut and they start talking about Meryl Streep. Babababababa gone through the whole thing and then I'm the old guy. They're smelling, have a, you know, prescription meds goes, uh, you know, whenever they talk about the roles you play, they always say, you know, you play independent minded women, very strong women. And Meryl Goes, I know that's, yeah, that's what they say. You know, when a guy, they never say to a guy, oh, you're playing a strong willed character, Yada Yada Yada. I let that go, whatever, no Biggie, I'll take that. It's probably true. The fuck do I know I'm not a Horman right. But then they show her after she played Margaret Stature and she's given a speech to a bunch of women's young girls. She's trying to inspire them and she, she takes a quote from Margaret Thatcher and it was something along the lines of, if you want a bunch of people to talk around, talk is standing around talking about doing something, you know, something a Golden Eagle, you got to talk to men.

Speaker 6:          01:09:30       But if you want it to actually get done, you got to get a woman and then all the chicks go, Woo. Like flipping out. Right. So I laughed and I'm like, Yay. Reverse sexism. Right. Just seeing, you know, my, my whole fucking theory how everybody is just a piece of shit. You just don't have the power to act out what the fuck you want to do because that, that right there, if you flip that around as a guy, if you're running for president, it's fucking over. He can't be like, let me tell you know, tell you what after I get you jobs and after I fixed this economy, okay? And I'm the man to do it because I'll tell you right now, if you're looking for someone to stand around and talk about doing something, you get a woman. You want to get done. You got to get a man. Here are my nuts right here on the podium. Vote for me November 4th go fuck yourself. Right? You did that. Your presidential campaigns over. She does it. It's fucking adorable and it's just as fucking ignorant, you know what I mean? What a fuck do you get off saying that we stand around and do nothing. Meryl Streep. Huh? Or quoting Margaret and you too. Margaret Thatcher.

Speaker 6:          01:10:40       Let me taste you bitches something. Alright? We faked a fucking lunar landing. Okay. You think that's just talking. Anybody can land on the fucking moon, that's easy. But to pretend you did it all right and get everybody to shut the fuck up about it. That, that, that, that right there, that takes skill. So whatever. So I make that little comment and um, then I just go with that, that, that, that, that suddenly fucking porky pig. So, so I make that comment and like, you know, I've been with Nia long enough that I can tell by the side of her face when she's just thinking about like, what if I just grabbed everything I really cared about and walked out of this house right now?

Speaker 6:          01:11:18       She got like that fucking mad at me, you know? And I'm like, she's just like, right after the story was over, she just shut the fucking thing off. And uh, I own half an extent. I'm walking to seven 11 and get some ice cream. I haven't, I've done even what happened was all going great. You know, am I the asshole there? What am I supposed to just fucking sit there with my mouth hanging open with drool coming out when I watch TV, if somebody says something Douchey, I'm not supposed to say it, whatever, whatever. So I just finally just said, you know what? Fuck this. I take the dog out. I go around the block. What do I do? I'm calling my guy friends, right? They're all backing me up. I'm not saying who I called. I don't name names, right? And they're all laughing their ass off and they 100% agree with me, which is all I'm looking for at this point. I just want people to say that I'm right. I don't want to learn anything from this experience. Just tell me I was right. So it can be an ignorant ass again. I don't know. Why don't you guys weigh in on that? Am I a Dick for saying that? Should I just let that one go? You know? Oh, you know what she said? That fucking drove me up the wall. She goes, why are you, she didn't say intimidated.

Speaker 6:          01:12:37       She was one of those words. Why are you threatened by what she, it's like I'm not threatened. I, yeah, Jesus Christ. Then I take the bait, you know, it just sends me right over it, like threatened about what? Oh my God. This person that I don't know who has never called me, nor will ever call me, who has no effect on my life. How do you get threatened by that? I'm just calling it for the bullshit that it is. Cause you know what? This is what fucking drives me nuts. I can't stand when somebody tells me that their shit sandwich tastes worse than my shit sandwich. Okay, go fuck yourself. At what point am I supposed to have empathy as I'm sitting here eating a shit sandwich and you're telling me how much worse your yours, yours is, you know, at the end of the fucking day.

Speaker 6:          01:13:24       You know what I mean? Sure. Mine might be on, you know, a better slice of bread, which I guess would make it taste a little bit better, but at the end of the fucking day, right the end of the fucking day. All right. I'm going to end up in a FEMA camp with you. Okay? You think on the next fucking a psycho comes along. I'm gonna make the cut. What the fuck? The white board, what do I bring to the world? Huh? Exactly. And to be standing right next to you. So go fuck yourself. You just fucking woman. Every time she sneezes, they give her another God damn award. She's still pitching, still fucking pitching. You know, I remember when I did this Oscar nominated part out. Go Fuck yourself with your wigs though thing. Just, you know, that's what fucking pisses me off when I watched this shit. If you want to know my perspective is from where I come from, I can't bitch about shit cause everybody's like, oh go fuck yourself. You hit the lottery. Right. But I got to sit here and listen to you bitch. Even if you fucking killing it, even if you're killing it, you know, Yale School of drama and he's stepped on the bull. Go Fuck yourself with your goddamn yachts. Alright, there you go. That felt good. It's probably ignorant or whatever. I love you.

Speaker 2:          01:14:40       Yeah. [inaudible] [inaudible].
