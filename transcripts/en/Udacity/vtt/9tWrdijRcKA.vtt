00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.000
Here is a really tricky quiz. Let's look at the robot motion again.

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:10.000
Say I change the last measurement from 2 down to 1.

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:15.000
You might remember the robot poses were -3, 2, and 5.

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:19.000
Before that modification the landmark position was 7, but a 1 doesn't really add up.

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:25.000
A 1 suggests I might be at a different distance to the 7 than the 5 over here

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:27.000
that comes from this side.

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:29.000
Here is my quiz.

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:34.000
First, I want you to know if I make this modification what is the effect on x2?

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:37.000
Will the estimate be smaller than 5?

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:40.000
That is, we shrink the robot path a little bit?

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:43.000
Will it be exactly equal to 5 like before?

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:47.000
Or will it be larger than 5? Check exactly 1 of the three boxes.

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:50.000
I also want to know what is the effect on x0.

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:55.000
Will it be smaller than -3, equals -3, or larger than -3.

00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:57.000
This is a completely nontrivial quiz.

00:00:57.000 --> 00:00:59.000
It takes really some thinking.

00:00:59.000 --> 09:59:59.000
Invest in thinking, and you can even go back and try it out.
