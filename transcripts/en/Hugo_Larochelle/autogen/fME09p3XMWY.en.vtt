00:00:00.020 --> 00:00:06.660
 in this capsule we will see the rule 

00:00:02.370 --> 00:00:09.450
 of chaining and the opel rule then 

00:00:06.660 --> 00:00:12.480
 start with the chaining rule that's 

00:00:09.450 --> 00:00:16.260
 a rule that will be able to make the link 

00:00:12.480 --> 00:00:18.420
 between a marginal probability and the 

00:00:16.260 --> 00:00:20.939
 conditional probabilities 

00:00:18.420 --> 00:00:22.410
 we will start with the rule of the product 

00:00:20.939 --> 00:00:25.439
 that rule for the particular case 

00:00:22.410 --> 00:00:27.359
 with two random variables so 

00:00:25.439 --> 00:00:30.330
 according to this rule rise if we take 

00:00:27.359 --> 00:00:33.270
 the example of spam that tells us that the 

00:00:30.330 --> 00:00:35.160
 probability that for example spam 

00:00:33.270 --> 00:00:37.860
 be equal to fo is unknown or equal to 

00:00:35.160 --> 00:00:39.800
 fact can be written in two ways one 

00:00:37.860 --> 00:00:43.320
 can write it as the probability 

00:00:39.800 --> 00:00:45.450
 marginal of strangers would equal times the 

00:00:43.320 --> 00:00:48.780
 probability that for there is legal wrong 

00:00:45.450 --> 00:00:50.399
 knowing that unknown is true where we can 

00:00:48.780 --> 00:00:52.980
 also write it as the priority 

00:00:50.399 --> 00:00:54.750
 of legal power fake times the 

00:00:52.980 --> 00:00:57.510
 probability that a stranger is equal 

00:00:54.750 --> 00:01:00.090
 Le Havre knowing that for yelle is equal 

00:00:57.510 --> 00:01:01.440
 wrongly and generally whatever 

00:01:00.090 --> 00:01:02.910
 the value of spam was 

00:01:01.440 --> 00:01:05.189
 unknown so as you see if I have 

00:01:02.910 --> 00:01:06.360
 not specified the value one has whatever 

00:01:05.189 --> 00:01:08.310
 their value of the variables 

00:01:06.360 --> 00:01:11.189
 random all the time that in our 

00:01:08.310 --> 00:01:13.350
 case here policy spam and unknown 

00:01:11.189 --> 00:01:15.420
 and with a strong image of the probity of 

00:01:13.350 --> 00:01:17.159
 spam and a stranger this is the 

00:01:15.420 --> 00:01:20.640
 politics of strangers times politics 

00:01:17.159 --> 00:01:22.740
 unknown sacha spam or it's also 

00:01:20.640 --> 00:01:24.869
 our ways of calculating his probity of 

00:01:22.740 --> 00:01:29.280
 junk times the probity of strangers 

00:01:24.869 --> 00:01:30.810
 knowing the value of spam and we 

00:01:29.280 --> 00:01:33.150
 can take this rule of the product and 

00:01:30.810 --> 00:01:35.549
 generalize it to the corner a barbie name 

00:01:33.150 --> 00:01:38.759
 lags in n2 random variable that I 

00:01:35.549 --> 00:01:42.420
 going noted x1 up excels in that 

00:01:38.759 --> 00:01:45.090
 if the joint probability of x1 up 

00:01:42.420 --> 00:01:48.509
 to ixelles well we can what we can 

00:01:45.090 --> 00:01:50.520
 to do it's separate but two groups of 

00:01:48.509 --> 00:01:53.970
 random way in group two 

00:01:50.520 --> 00:01:54.450
 extremes up to x men -1 then xn 

00:01:53.970 --> 00:01:56.189
 only 

00:01:54.450 --> 00:01:57.719
 and if I mention the rule of the product but 

00:01:56.189 --> 00:02:03.840
 it's going to say it's the product of the 

00:01:57.719 --> 00:02:05.520
 joined probability so marginal on 

00:02:03.840 --> 00:02:08.640
 only ex years up to excellent less 

00:02:05.520 --> 00:02:11.610
 1 times the probability of xn knowing ex1 

00:02:08.640 --> 00:02:13.110
 up to excellent - this is 2 of 

00:02:11.610 --> 00:02:15.660
 way the cures if I can replicate 

00:02:13.110 --> 00:02:17.580
 product stops but on this 

00:02:15.660 --> 00:02:20.370
 probability here here about my values ​​and 

00:02:17.580 --> 00:02:22.770
 thouars ex1 until excellent - a game 

00:02:20.370 --> 00:02:25.710
 not separate the two bodies the two 

00:02:22.770 --> 00:02:27.510
 group ii x up to excess -2 and excel 

00:02:25.710 --> 00:02:30.450
 - and if I apply the stop of the product 

00:02:27.510 --> 00:02:32.840
 so that here range of the ex years up 

00:02:30.450 --> 00:02:35.130
 great way it's the product of 

00:02:32.840 --> 00:02:37.020
 enjoy the screen up to xl less 

00:02:35.130 --> 00:02:38.790
 twice the probability of an excellent 

00:02:37.020 --> 00:02:41.340
 - hours knowing the values ​​of the ex 

00:02:38.790 --> 00:02:43.140
 until excellent - 2 and then I 

00:02:41.340 --> 00:02:44.850
 still my term here and if I continue 

00:02:43.140 --> 00:02:48.560
 like that I can get the formula 

00:02:44.850 --> 00:02:56.790
 general which is the probability of x1 

00:02:48.560 --> 00:02:59.550
 until ex n is equal to the product of the 

00:02:56.790 --> 00:03:02.070
 probability of xy knowing the variables 

00:02:59.550 --> 00:03:04.350
 random x1 until aix i - 1 

00:03:02.070 --> 00:03:06.570
 and that I do the product for there is 

00:03:04.350 --> 00:03:10.080
 equals 1 to reindeer 

00:03:06.570 --> 00:03:13.560
 so that office is a way of 

00:03:10.080 --> 00:03:16.890
 to express it if the product of everything but 

00:03:13.560 --> 00:03:19.200
 not ultimate marginal hexis purchases them 

00:03:16.890 --> 00:03:21.750
 variables etc without up to aix and less 

00:03:19.200 --> 00:03:24.239
 young people and in my notation I can 

00:03:21.750 --> 00:03:25.980
 assume that the coc equals a calf 

00:03:24.239 --> 00:03:28.200
 corresponds to only the producer 

00:03:25.980 --> 00:03:31.500
 marginal of the ex a name that will have no 

00:03:28.200 --> 00:03:33.120
 continue because also and this symbol has 

00:03:31.500 --> 00:03:34.799
 here if you wonder what it is 

00:03:33.120 --> 00:03:37.350
 it's the equivalent of the summation but 

00:03:34.799 --> 00:03:40.049
 or rather than accumulate right now 

00:03:37.350 --> 00:03:42.900
 the terms here we will welcome them in 

00:03:40.049 --> 00:03:46.260
 multiplying them together so that's 

00:03:42.900 --> 00:03:50.220
 a way to write probability of x1 

00:03:46.260 --> 00:03:53.370
 times the probability of x2 sacha experts 

00:03:50.220 --> 00:03:59.750
 times the likelihood of peace then the 

00:03:53.370 --> 00:04:03.420
 part ii x3 sacha x2 and x1 is instituted 

00:03:59.750 --> 00:04:12.750
 up to the probability of hicks and 

00:04:03.420 --> 00:04:15.130
 sasha x1 to xn - that's the rule 

00:04:12.750 --> 00:04:17.500
 chaining 

00:04:15.130 --> 00:04:20.820
 the chaining rule it's true 

00:04:17.500 --> 00:04:24.280
 whatever the distribution 

00:04:20.820 --> 00:04:27.100
 his spouse on everything but variables etc 

00:04:24.280 --> 00:04:28.630
 101 up to rexel on what it wants 

00:04:27.100 --> 00:04:31.330
 to say it's actually rather than 

00:04:28.630 --> 00:04:32.830
 specify but joint probability and 

00:04:31.330 --> 00:04:34.360
 who are up to excellent a bit like 

00:04:32.830 --> 00:04:35.650
 I did at the very beginning hall in the 

00:04:34.360 --> 00:04:38.800
 first capsule where I gave the 

00:04:35.650 --> 00:04:40.480
 priority of assigning my three 

00:04:38.800 --> 00:04:42.970
 random variables for all 

00:04:40.480 --> 00:04:45.390
 possible causes for the specified call 

00:04:42.970 --> 00:04:47.680
 my conditional probabilities of x1 

00:04:45.390 --> 00:04:49.270
 sorry my door is marginal from the ex in 

00:04:47.680 --> 00:04:52.060
 pretending to be my own which conditioned ii 

00:04:49.270 --> 00:04:54.010
 x2 sacha ex1 my probity continue from 

00:04:52.060 --> 00:04:57.130
 the ex 3 knowing x1 x2 and so on 

00:04:54.010 --> 00:04:59.830
 for everything but random variable and if 

00:04:57.130 --> 00:05:03.610
 we give everything happened and the water 

00:04:59.830 --> 00:05:05.020
 here I can calculate with the stop of 

00:05:03.610 --> 00:05:07.030
 chaining all its producers 

00:05:05.020 --> 00:05:10.090
 here so this is an equivalent way of 

00:05:07.030 --> 00:05:12.370
 define a probabilistic model up but 

00:05:10.090 --> 00:05:13.570
 random variable for example in my 

00:05:12.370 --> 00:05:13.960
 spamming neck but I so I 

00:05:13.570 --> 00:05:15.850
 only 

00:05:13.960 --> 00:05:17.230
 I therefore consider even simpler 

00:05:15.850 --> 00:05:19.870
 with two random variables for y 

00:05:17.230 --> 00:05:23.020
 go unknown rather than specify 

00:05:19.870 --> 00:05:25.960
 all the probabilities attached for 

00:05:23.020 --> 00:05:27.460
 yelle is unknown I could specify 

00:05:25.960 --> 00:05:29.350
 the marginal policy says long on 

00:05:27.460 --> 00:05:31.990
 spam so what is probity has 

00:05:29.350 --> 00:05:35.080
 priori to observe to receive a 

00:05:31.990 --> 00:05:37.420
 email because if we ask that 80% 

00:05:35.080 --> 00:05:39.250
 of time I get a bridge for yen 

00:05:37.420 --> 00:05:41.020
 then but to find out that 

00:05:39.250 --> 00:05:43.240
 I get that I get are some 

00:05:41.020 --> 00:05:44.500
 spam and then we say that I 

00:05:43.240 --> 00:05:47.020
 could define all my priorities 

00:05:44.500 --> 00:05:51.820
 conditional possible so the quality 

00:05:47.020 --> 00:05:54.730
 that the sender is unknown when I 

00:05:51.820 --> 00:05:56.500
 get paul when I'm scared it's a 

00:05:54.730 --> 00:05:58.150
 email so the priority in that 

00:05:56.500 --> 00:06:02.620
 if they happen to have been thrown it's up to 

00:05:58.150 --> 00:06:04.540
 to say that if I know the shipper no 

00:06:02.620 --> 00:06:08.110
 sorry if I get 

00:06:04.540 --> 00:06:10.639
 I received spam the chances that I 

00:06:08.110 --> 00:06:14.240
 do not know the sender 

00:06:10.639 --> 00:06:16.400
 the sounds are not good if I get a 

00:06:14.240 --> 00:06:18.349
 kind be not spam so if I 

00:06:16.400 --> 00:06:21.650
 received one I received a valid email 

00:06:18.349 --> 00:06:23.629
 the probability that I know 

00:06:21.650 --> 00:06:26.840
 the sender therefore unknown on galas 

00:06:23.629 --> 00:06:28.939
 fake and pretty high then we notice 

00:06:26.840 --> 00:06:30.680
 if not, ie if I 

00:06:28.939 --> 00:06:32.060
 know that I received it is beautiful and 

00:06:30.680 --> 00:06:35.110
 well spam in that if the 

00:06:32.060 --> 00:06:38.180
 probability that I know 

00:06:35.110 --> 00:06:40.789
 the sender ie the address 

00:06:38.180 --> 00:06:43.460
 of the sender is not unknown is 

00:06:40.789 --> 00:06:45.340
 lower is much higher so 

00:06:43.460 --> 00:06:48.590
 I do not know the sender what 

00:06:45.340 --> 00:06:52.789
 so in that it does not represent too much 

00:06:48.590 --> 00:06:54.409
 badly a Korean and so so at the beach 

00:06:52.789 --> 00:06:56.779
 had specified all that I could 

00:06:54.409 --> 00:06:59.330
 calculated all but not ultimate marginal 

00:06:56.779 --> 00:07:01.550
 on email and so unknown between 

00:06:59.330 --> 00:07:03.740
 others the probability that for yesterday is 

00:07:01.550 --> 00:07:05.389
 false etc. unknown be true it would be the 

00:07:03.740 --> 00:07:07.939
 probability that a stranger is true 

00:07:05.389 --> 00:07:10.099
 knowing that to go in so must in 

00:07:07.939 --> 00:07:17.330
 this case also this probability the man 

00:07:10.099 --> 00:07:19.219
 is given but give here it's zero 

00:07:17.330 --> 00:07:21.560
 point is the unknown productivity is 

00:07:19.219 --> 00:07:25.389
 true knowing that to go there must times 

00:07:21.560 --> 00:07:29.409
 the probability a priori that spam 

00:07:25.389 --> 00:07:33.289
 is fake gala and it gives me here 

00:07:29.409 --> 00:07:38.449
 so I produce it from 0.1 says 0.8 it's me 

00:07:33.289 --> 00:07:40.490
 gives 0.08 and so that would be according to that 

00:07:38.449 --> 00:07:42.979
 model parity e-mail attachments 

00:07:40.490 --> 00:07:45.259
 equal fake and unknown there is the true 

00:07:42.979 --> 00:07:46.580
 and then another example if I would do 

00:07:45.259 --> 00:07:49.060
 not but that you can do like 

00:07:46.580 --> 00:07:49.060
 exercise 

00:07:50.639 --> 00:07:56.310
 ok but let's imagine that I did all 

00:07:52.680 --> 00:07:57.990
 these definitions of marginal probity then 

00:07:56.310 --> 00:08:00.960
 conditional but that there I want 

00:07:57.990 --> 00:08:03.090
 calculate the probability that the emails 

00:08:00.960 --> 00:08:08.159
 that I received from tax be what a 

00:08:03.090 --> 00:08:11.099
 spam knowing that I observed that 

00:08:08.159 --> 00:08:13.050
 the sender's address is unknown 

00:08:11.099 --> 00:08:14.789
 ok so noticed that here is the 

00:08:13.050 --> 00:08:17.909
 conditional in the opposite direction me 

00:08:14.789 --> 00:08:21.180
 I had defined in my example the 

00:08:17.909 --> 00:08:23.039
 probability of unknown knowing spam 

00:08:21.180 --> 00:08:24.840
 but I'm asked and I'm interested in 

00:08:23.039 --> 00:08:26.400
 calculate the spam policy 

00:08:24.840 --> 00:08:27.569
 knowing unknown so if that's 

00:08:26.400 --> 00:08:29.520
 actually it would allow me to 

00:08:27.569 --> 00:08:32.490
 make a decision whether to observe 

00:08:29.520 --> 00:08:35.969
 that the sender is unknown 

00:08:32.490 --> 00:08:38.640
 I put the email in a box 

00:08:35.969 --> 00:08:40.260
 emails or not ok but it turns out 

00:08:38.640 --> 00:08:44.159
 that I can still do this calculation 

00:08:40.260 --> 00:08:45.570
 even though I defined p2i sacha known 

00:08:44.159 --> 00:08:45.990
 sacha for yesterday i'm able to 

00:08:45.570 --> 00:08:49.050
 calculate 

00:08:45.990 --> 00:08:51.839
 and then knowing spam and I 

00:08:49.050 --> 00:08:54.209
 do it as dense as if I have 

00:08:51.839 --> 00:08:57.209
 actually need the probability of 

00:08:54.209 --> 00:08:59.010
 unknown knowing spam but also from 

00:08:57.209 --> 00:09:01.170
 the probability of spam only 

00:08:59.010 --> 00:09:04.019
 so actually the probity of 

00:09:01.170 --> 00:09:06.779
 spam equal fake knowing that a 

00:09:04.019 --> 00:09:08.490
 unknown by definition would equal 

00:09:06.779 --> 00:09:10.140
 conditional it's the probability of 

00:09:08.490 --> 00:09:12.449
 spam equals false and unknown he 

00:09:10.140 --> 00:09:16.800
 should divide by the probability of a 

00:09:12.449 --> 00:09:18.120
 unknown and wasted this priority on 

00:09:16.800 --> 00:09:20.970
 these two labs there I can 

00:09:18.120 --> 00:09:22.829
 write it as because of the rule of 

00:09:20.970 --> 00:09:24.480
 chaining like the unknown policy 

00:09:22.829 --> 00:09:26.550
 gallerey knowing junk there is the fake 

00:09:24.480 --> 00:09:28.470
 times to go there fake galls I 

00:09:26.550 --> 00:09:32.970
 again this is the same theme 

00:09:28.470 --> 00:09:36.000
 who says if I find him here and my 

00:09:32.970 --> 00:09:39.180
 unknown marginal probability equals true 

00:09:36.000 --> 00:09:42.120
 it's the marginal probability is known 

00:09:39.180 --> 00:09:43.440
 would equal for illegal it takes more the 

00:09:42.120 --> 00:09:45.000
 parity is known and gavray could 

00:09:43.440 --> 00:09:46.949
 legal should so I sum up on 

00:09:45.000 --> 00:09:48.949
 murderous laboratory bullets 

00:09:46.949 --> 00:09:51.449
 spam since is not specified 

00:09:48.949 --> 00:09:54.089
 is another way to see that this is a 

00:09:51.449 --> 00:09:56.850
 way for me to normalize in fact my 

00:09:54.089 --> 00:09:57.720
 numerator who are at a knock if I 

00:09:56.850 --> 00:09:59.010
 put all the numbers 

00:09:57.720 --> 00:10:01.949
 I do all the calculations I will do them 

00:09:59.010 --> 00:10:03.400
 no time but it gives me 0.08 of 

00:10:01.949 --> 00:10:06.430
 0.08 more 

00:10:03.400 --> 00:10:10.380
 it's at the water point which gives me 0.4 

00:10:06.430 --> 00:10:13.120
 so even if I had defined 

00:10:10.380 --> 00:10:15.010
 colter of unknown knowing spam and 

00:10:13.120 --> 00:10:19.000
 to take advantage of the careers I am able 

00:10:15.010 --> 00:10:21.010
 to laugh at Der derivatives derived actually 

00:10:19.000 --> 00:10:25.860
 the spam policy knowing 

00:10:21.010 --> 00:10:25.860
 unknown from the part of that 

00:10:26.460 --> 00:10:31.720
 then the rule of beille is a rule 

00:10:28.630 --> 00:10:35.590
 who will formalize this reasoning the 

00:10:31.720 --> 00:10:37.810
 basic rule says that the probability of 

00:10:35.590 --> 00:10:39.910
 some causes sacha options that 

00:10:37.810 --> 00:10:42.280
 we observe can be calculated as 

00:10:39.910 --> 00:10:46.390
 being the product of the probity of 

00:10:42.280 --> 00:10:48.300
 effects sacha the causes times the pole t &amp; d 

00:10:46.390 --> 00:10:50.710
 causes the word of marginal causes 

00:10:48.300 --> 00:10:52.990
 standardized so dividing by the 

00:10:50.710 --> 00:10:55.630
 marginal policy effects in 

00:10:52.990 --> 00:10:58.540
 our body the basic rule that actually 

00:10:55.630 --> 00:11:01.240
 the link between my spam policy 

00:10:58.540 --> 00:11:03.910
 knowing that I observed unknown that I 

00:11:01.240 --> 00:11:05.380
 know the value of unknowns and says that 

00:11:03.910 --> 00:11:08.110
 it's actually the production of strangers 

00:11:05.380 --> 00:11:12.520
 knowing spam times my probability of 

00:11:08.110 --> 00:11:16.270
 standardized spam by dividing by the 

00:11:12.520 --> 00:11:18.010
 marginal parity of unknowns in the 

00:11:16.270 --> 00:11:19.990
 context the bank of decline we will say 

00:11:18.010 --> 00:11:22.840
 that the quality of spam or the 

00:11:19.990 --> 00:11:23.560
 probability of cause it's a 

00:11:22.840 --> 00:11:27.130
 probability 

00:11:23.560 --> 00:11:28.480
 a priori what does that actually mean 

00:11:27.130 --> 00:11:31.990
 that's what it's all about 

00:11:28.480 --> 00:11:34.120
 it's our belief about the fact 

00:11:31.990 --> 00:11:36.270
 a new email is spam 

00:11:34.120 --> 00:11:39.940
 even before we have seen its content 

00:11:36.270 --> 00:11:42.580
 and we're going to get with obese stopping 

00:11:39.940 --> 00:11:44.980
 a posterior probability so that's 

00:11:42.580 --> 00:11:47.140
 the probability of sacha spam 

00:11:44.980 --> 00:11:49.320
 unknown and this makes it our belief 

00:11:47.140 --> 00:11:52.090
 which has been updated 

00:11:49.320 --> 00:11:55.060
 after observing that the author of 

00:11:52.090 --> 00:11:56.950
 email and is unknown or not so in 

00:11:55.060 --> 00:11:59.230
 this case if these unknown galas true 

00:11:56.950 --> 00:12:01.240
 would we could update it is 

00:11:59.230 --> 00:12:04.060
 what our certainty about the fact 

00:12:01.240 --> 00:12:06.520
 that our mail received an email to 

00:12:04.060 --> 00:12:08.530
 using his business proofs that 

00:12:06.520 --> 00:12:11.260
 corresponds to finally calculating a 

00:12:08.530 --> 00:12:13.470
 probability to posterior of the rule of 

00:12:11.260 --> 00:12:15.310
 base makes it possible to smooth 2 probability 

00:12:13.470 --> 00:12:16.019
 the assembly will allow us to do 

00:12:15.310 --> 00:12:18.420
 finally 

00:12:16.019 --> 00:12:20.249
 probabilistic reasoning the other 

00:12:18.420 --> 00:12:22.499
 way to finally see the abc rule she 

00:12:20.249 --> 00:12:24.629
 will allow us to get a 

00:12:22.499 --> 00:12:27.059
 probability diagnosis none 

00:12:24.629 --> 00:12:29.009
 probability that makes it possible to do the 

00:12:27.059 --> 00:12:31.649
 diagnosis of causes from 

00:12:29.009 --> 00:12:33.119
 some observed effects and therefore hyper 

00:12:31.649 --> 00:12:35.910
 do it from that she that from 

00:12:33.119 --> 00:12:38.970
 of a causa probability ie a 

00:12:35.910 --> 00:12:40.829
 probability of a distribution of 

00:12:38.970 --> 00:12:42.509
 effects from the ribs 

00:12:40.829 --> 00:12:44.339
 is needed though 

00:12:42.509 --> 00:12:47.129
 also we define the 

00:12:44.339 --> 00:12:48.540
 prior probability of the accounts the 

00:12:47.129 --> 00:12:49.980
 part of his little used the rule of 

00:12:48.540 --> 00:12:52.730
 basis and reasoning 

00:12:49.980 --> 00:12:52.730
 probabilistic
