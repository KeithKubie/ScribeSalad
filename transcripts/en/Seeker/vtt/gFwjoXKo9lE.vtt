00:00:00.290 --> 00:00:01.619
Will ET phone home?

00:00:01.619 --> 00:00:02.619
Who knows!

00:00:02.619 --> 00:00:06.359
But we'd better pick up the call, wouldn't
want to make those guys angry.

00:00:06.359 --> 00:00:14.429
Hello, I'm Ian O'Neill, space producer for
Discovery News.

00:00:14.429 --> 00:00:18.350
As we discover more and more alien worlds
orbiting distant stars, the question "Are

00:00:18.350 --> 00:00:19.350
we alone?"

00:00:19.350 --> 00:00:20.940
becomes more and more pressing.

00:00:20.940 --> 00:00:24.480
Surely there are other life forms out there
-- perhaps even alien civilizations.

00:00:24.480 --> 00:00:26.800
Unfortunately, space is big.

00:00:26.800 --> 00:00:28.240
Really, REALLY big.

00:00:28.240 --> 00:00:32.890
In the future we might be able to send a probe
to another solar system to find intelligent

00:00:32.890 --> 00:00:35.770
extraterrestrial life, but that's a tough
prospect.

00:00:35.770 --> 00:00:39.930
The nearest star is around 4 light-years away
and using current propulsion technology it

00:00:39.930 --> 00:00:42.460
would take us tens of thousands of years to
get there.

00:00:42.460 --> 00:00:46.990
So until we develop new ways of speeding around
the galaxy to find intelligent life, astronomers

00:00:46.990 --> 00:00:50.720
are thinking up some ingenious methods of
detecting their presence without even leaving

00:00:50.720 --> 00:00:51.720
Earth.

00:00:51.720 --> 00:00:52.720
Here are some of my favorites:

00:00:52.720 --> 00:00:56.390
The first is an obvious one and is currently
the main method behind the Search for Extraterrestrial

00:00:56.390 --> 00:00:57.690
Intelligence, or "SETI".

00:00:57.690 --> 00:01:02.370
This is to look for radio signals (or even
laser pulses) that may be transmitted by ET.

00:01:02.370 --> 00:01:06.500
Humanity has been leaking artificial signals
into space for over 100 years and we've been

00:01:06.500 --> 00:01:09.440
blasting radar into the solar system for many
decades.

00:01:09.440 --> 00:01:12.920
This "accidental" leakage could be picked
up by a nearby alien civilization.

00:01:12.920 --> 00:01:17.890
We are also beaming radio signals at stars
known to have planets in orbit in the hope

00:01:17.890 --> 00:01:20.830
our electromagnetic "message in a bottle"
gets picked up.

00:01:20.830 --> 00:01:23.740
What if aliens are leaking radio signals into
space as well?

00:01:23.740 --> 00:01:27.979
That's why we are trying to "look out" for
their signal using radio antennae.

00:01:27.979 --> 00:01:32.890
So far, there have been a few isolated cases
of bizarre signals, but nothing definitive.

00:01:32.890 --> 00:01:38.130
A second cool way we may detect an alien civilization
is if we observe dust and small chunks of

00:01:38.130 --> 00:01:41.440
depleted asteroids in a distant star system.

00:01:41.440 --> 00:01:45.950
Astronomers may be confused by the anomalous
quantities of dust and may hint at a spacefaring

00:01:45.950 --> 00:01:49.040
alien race mining asteroids for resources.

00:01:49.040 --> 00:01:53.070
Now that we're getting rather good at detecting
exoplanets, eventually we'll be able to develop

00:01:53.070 --> 00:01:57.840
telescopes that will be able to analyze the
chemical makeup of atmospheres of small planets

00:01:57.840 --> 00:02:00.270
orbiting very close to their stars.

00:02:00.270 --> 00:02:06.240
Astronomers can use spectroscopy to identify
the fingerprint of certain atmospheric chemicals.

00:02:06.240 --> 00:02:12.299
Say if they detected chemicals like chlorofluorocarbons,
or CFCs?

00:02:12.299 --> 00:02:16.650
Humanity has been struggling with CFCs for
some time and they were commonly used in pressurized

00:02:16.650 --> 00:02:20.260
containers like hairspray and refrigerators
-- but when released into the atmosphere the

00:02:20.260 --> 00:02:22.629
chemical breaks down our protective ozone
layer.

00:02:22.629 --> 00:02:26.480
But CFCs are ONLY created through industrial
processes.

00:02:26.480 --> 00:02:31.680
So imagine if we saw CFCs in the atmosphere
of an exoplanet!

00:02:31.680 --> 00:02:34.919
It could mean only one thing: industrialized
aliens!

00:02:34.919 --> 00:02:38.879
Many other chemical groups that have no known
natural production mechanism would also make

00:02:38.879 --> 00:02:40.859
for a fascinating discovery.

00:02:40.859 --> 00:02:45.069
Astronomers could also search for astronomical
signatures of alien mega-engineering projects

00:02:45.069 --> 00:02:49.779
like Dyson spheres, huge artificial planets
or even extreme stellar power stations that

00:02:49.779 --> 00:02:51.059
use black holes as fuel!

00:02:51.059 --> 00:02:55.529
This search is called, perhaps unsurprisingly,
the Search for Extraterrestrial Technology,

00:02:55.529 --> 00:02:57.010
or simply "SETT."

00:02:57.010 --> 00:03:00.049
But ultimately, the only sure-fire way we'll
find any form of alien life -- intelligent

00:03:00.049 --> 00:03:02.129
or otherwise -- is to actually get out there.

00:03:02.129 --> 00:03:05.529
In the short term, we need to send robots
and eventually humans to planetary bodies

00:03:05.529 --> 00:03:09.849
in the Solar System to seek out basic lifeforms
-- perhaps even complex lifeforms in the oceans

00:03:09.849 --> 00:03:11.439
of Europa... who knows!

00:03:11.439 --> 00:03:15.840
But if we do happen to stumble across an intelligent
alien civilization, or if they happen to stumble

00:03:15.840 --> 00:03:18.419
across us, let's just hope they're friendly.

00:03:18.419 --> 00:03:20.469
Do you think we should seek out intelligent
aliens?

00:03:20.469 --> 00:03:23.019
Or should we just keep quiet to avoid being
attacked?
