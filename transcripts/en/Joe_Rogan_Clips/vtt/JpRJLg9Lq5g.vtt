WEBVTT

1
00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.620
The older I get,
I'm just a plus,
man.
I need a man up.
I used to be so aggressive.

2
00:00:04.621 --> 00:00:07.530
Big Dude,
you're strong.
That's why nobody messes with me.
Oh,

3
00:00:07.531 --> 00:00:10.620
so they leave you alone and that's I because of it.
Yeah,
I know what it's like.

4
00:00:10.650 --> 00:00:15.560
It's like,
um,
like you,
you like fight and all that stuff.
Like I can't even,

5
00:00:15.600 --> 00:00:19.800
like if somebody punched me in the face today,
I don't know how I would react.

6
00:00:19.830 --> 00:00:23.820
Like,
I don't know.
I used to be a bouncer at clubs.
I played college football.

7
00:00:24.090 --> 00:00:29.060
I was a tough dude.
Now everyone apart,
dude,
can I get you to the gym?
No,

8
00:00:29.220 --> 00:00:33.120
no,
no,
no.
I'm in shape.
But I mean like a fight gym.
No.
No.
Why?
No?

9
00:00:33.320 --> 00:00:35.820
I had a little bit.
No,
not to fight people.

10
00:00:36.040 --> 00:00:39.720
Why do you so you don't worry about it?
I never worry about it.
Okay,

11
00:00:39.721 --> 00:00:42.740
well then don't worry about it cause I'm at home at eight 30 [inaudible]

12
00:00:42.760 --> 00:00:46.590
sleeping by nine to stand up.
I know.
I saw you at the Improv the other night.

13
00:00:46.591 --> 00:00:49.710
I have nobody's go jump on stage.
I'm talking about family.
Oh man,

14
00:00:49.740 --> 00:00:51.000
you never know people crazy.

15
00:00:51.030 --> 00:00:55.100
Does anyone want to dude jumped up on the WWF and uh,
attacked.
Uh,

16
00:00:55.410 --> 00:00:59.370
who did he attacked?
He attacked Bret Harte speech.
That's crazy.

17
00:00:59.780 --> 00:01:02.910
It's gotta be like,
how old is he now?
He's a stroke survivor.

18
00:01:02.940 --> 00:01:07.020
So fucked up and they got tackled him.
Jesus.
But Joe,
seriously,

19
00:01:07.021 --> 00:01:10.200
you think anybody's going to jump on stage when you're on some dude and could

20
00:01:10.201 --> 00:01:12.170
easily,
you would fucking kill him.
No,
this,

21
00:01:12.270 --> 00:01:13.830
there's a lot of people they can kill me.

22
00:01:13.831 --> 00:01:18.831
You don't get confused now I know a lot of have been here all the time.

23
00:01:19.290 --> 00:01:21.830
I get that.
But like I,
I,

24
00:01:22.140 --> 00:01:25.290
I just don't see me doing stand up talking about family and love and a dude

25
00:01:25.291 --> 00:01:29.160
because I hate family and love.
I'm gonna jump up.
It's that.
It's not rational.

26
00:01:29.161 --> 00:01:32.220
Nothing.
Right?
A rational person wouldn't do that,

27
00:01:32.221 --> 00:01:34.740
but you're not worried about rational people anyway.
Okay.
So,

28
00:01:34.741 --> 00:01:38.130
so say I started to go to a fight gym.
Like where would I start at?

29
00:01:38.550 --> 00:01:42.120
Like what I do,
I would say you should try Jiu Jitsu cause it's fun.

30
00:01:42.150 --> 00:01:46.560
It's really good exercise and you'll learn some stuff.
You learn how to do it.

31
00:01:46.590 --> 00:01:50.340
It's a technique based art where it's like,
say if,
um,

32
00:01:51.240 --> 00:01:55.200
if you like,
there's,
there's guys that I will,
uh,
do Jiu Jitsu sparring.

33
00:01:55.201 --> 00:01:58.800
We call rolling.
Okay.
There's guys that I will roll with that are weaker than me,

34
00:01:58.830 --> 00:02:02.730
smaller than me and tap me every time I wrote with them and I'm a black belt.

35
00:02:02.910 --> 00:02:04.750
Okay.
That's reality.
Like if there's,

36
00:02:04.780 --> 00:02:08.220
there's guys out there that are 150 pounds that I can roll with that I know will

37
00:02:08.221 --> 00:02:11.820
tap me virtually every time we roll because their technique is sharper.

38
00:02:11.820 --> 00:02:15.330
They train more often than I am.
They're more focused,
they're more in the groove.

39
00:02:15.750 --> 00:02:18.210
But I also heard you say like one of your podcasts,

40
00:02:18.211 --> 00:02:21.150
you've got to watch out who you train with because they might just try to hurt

41
00:02:21.151 --> 00:02:22.750
you.
That's trying need,
I need,

42
00:02:22.751 --> 00:02:26.040
you got to go to a good school with good ethics because a good school with good

43
00:02:26.041 --> 00:02:29.130
ethics,
they get rid of those guys.
Did you know,
do you know one in studio city?

44
00:02:29.220 --> 00:02:33.480
I'm sure I'll get,
yeah,
no,
I'll do it.
I want to learn,
there's a good spot,

45
00:02:33.540 --> 00:02:35.850
just a little further than that and Tarzana.
Okay.

46
00:02:35.880 --> 00:02:39.270
Machado's where I got my black belt.
So John Jacques Machado.

47
00:02:39.271 --> 00:02:41.120
I train there sometimes and um,

48
00:02:41.130 --> 00:02:44.540
he used to have a place in Malibu but closed down because of the fires.
Um,

49
00:02:44.610 --> 00:02:47.520
but they um,
they have an outstanding CIM.

50
00:02:47.521 --> 00:02:51.240
It's like one of the best in the country and it's in that area as far as

51
00:02:51.241 --> 00:02:53.220
teaching top notch like,

52
00:02:53.430 --> 00:02:56.850
but there's a lot of really good Jujitsu schools now.

53
00:02:57.090 --> 00:03:00.610
It's not like I'm like when I started in [inaudible] 96,

54
00:03:00.670 --> 00:03:02.500
it was hard to find a good gym.

55
00:03:02.501 --> 00:03:05.800
There was only like five of them in all of California.
Right.

56
00:03:06.500 --> 00:03:07.810
Cause it was just starting out.

57
00:03:07.830 --> 00:03:12.100
I was like 93 is when Jujitsu sort of emerged in the public consciousness

58
00:03:12.101 --> 00:03:15.220
because of the UFC.
And then the,
the gym started like popping up,
popping up.

59
00:03:15.221 --> 00:03:17.140
But I was really lucky.
There was like Hixon Gracie's,

60
00:03:17.141 --> 00:03:20.830
which is where I took my first class and then Carlson Gracie's,

61
00:03:20.831 --> 00:03:23.110
I thought they were like the same.
And the other one was closer,

62
00:03:23.111 --> 00:03:25.150
so I just switched to Carlson's.
I didn't know shit.
You know,

63
00:03:25.151 --> 00:03:26.650
it was white belt but,

64
00:03:26.730 --> 00:03:29.380
and then there was a Machado's and then like a couple other places.

65
00:03:29.381 --> 00:03:32.890
How long does it take you to get to a black belt?
Like for you?

66
00:03:32.891 --> 00:03:35.980
Some guy took me a long time.
I was a brown belt for eight years,

67
00:03:36.280 --> 00:03:39.430
but it was just because I wasn't training as much as I should have.
Like they,

68
00:03:39.431 --> 00:03:43.060
you don't,
they don't give them away.
Like you have to be a real black belt.

69
00:03:43.180 --> 00:03:47.080
But I just mean who decides what is somebody just watched instructors and you
do?

70
00:03:47.210 --> 00:03:49.570
No.
Okay.
Well everyone knows.
It's like,

71
00:03:49.810 --> 00:03:53.020
like you know when a guy is fucking killing,
like,
like he,

72
00:03:53.021 --> 00:03:57.310
let's take like Theo Vaughan for example,
like Theo,
I love him.

73
00:03:57.700 --> 00:04:02.290
He hit a groove sometime ago,
whether it's two years ago or whatever it was.

74
00:04:02.530 --> 00:04:04.940
And I remember being in the back of the store and I was like,
dude,

75
00:04:04.950 --> 00:04:09.850
this motherfucker's on fire.
Yeah.
He started hitting that groove.
That where,

76
00:04:09.851 --> 00:04:12.950
where you go and sit down,
you want to watch is set,
you know.

77
00:04:13.180 --> 00:04:16.630
And I think when that happens in Jujitsu,
it's the same kind of thing.

78
00:04:16.630 --> 00:04:20.730
Guys started talking to my like,
dude,
Mike has been tapping everybody,
dude,

79
00:04:20.800 --> 00:04:24.010
he's just his,
his Jujitsu so sharp and you're like,
man,

80
00:04:24.011 --> 00:04:25.630
I'm gonna Watch them roll.
And then you watch them.

81
00:04:25.631 --> 00:04:29.470
Only like two that pass at guard pass and it got to start asking like how often

82
00:04:29.471 --> 00:04:31.850
are you training?
I'm going five days a week now.
Really Yad,

83
00:04:31.870 --> 00:04:34.870
I'm taking two privates block.
And then you know,

84
00:04:34.871 --> 00:04:39.871
like this guy is on the quest and you'll see a guy go from white belt to black

85
00:04:40.151 --> 00:04:43.630
belt in three years,
but they have to be super exceptional,

86
00:04:43.690 --> 00:04:47.710
like really unusual athletes.
Unusual mindset,

87
00:04:47.711 --> 00:04:51.040
unusual discipline.
It can happen most of the time,

88
00:04:51.041 --> 00:04:55.150
like a garden variety estimate is like 10 years is realistic.

89
00:04:55.660 --> 00:04:57.700
White belt to black belt for a regular person.

90
00:04:57.910 --> 00:05:00.370
If you really train hard and you really dedicate yourself,

91
00:05:00.520 --> 00:05:03.010
but freaks can get there quicker.
Like Bj Penn,

92
00:05:03.250 --> 00:05:05.890
he won the Moon Dealz which is the world championships.

93
00:05:05.920 --> 00:05:09.400
After three years of training,
three years of training.
He was a black belt one.

94
00:05:09.401 --> 00:05:12.700
The world child should be doing that to PJ's a special guy though.

95
00:05:12.760 --> 00:05:15.250
I used also got legs that are like arms.
He,

96
00:05:15.300 --> 00:05:19.560
he has leg dexterity like no one on the planet.
I got the chicken legs.

97
00:05:19.950 --> 00:05:22.360
It's actually good.
Is it really?
Yeah.

98
00:05:22.570 --> 00:05:26.560
You could cinch up triangles on people with chicken legs.
Yeah,

99
00:05:26.561 --> 00:05:29.470
for real and are sitting up.
People everywhere though.

100
00:05:29.471 --> 00:05:34.000
Just think about it in terms of leverage guys with longer limbs,

101
00:05:34.001 --> 00:05:38.170
like a hydra Gracie's a perfect example.
He's a really tall long guy.

102
00:05:38.350 --> 00:05:40.210
So on the best Jujitsu players ever,

103
00:05:40.420 --> 00:05:45.420
they can do things with those limbs that a shorter person can't do in terms of

104
00:05:45.761 --> 00:05:48.010
like leverage from joints and stuff like this.

105
00:05:48.011 --> 00:05:50.770
Like there's advantages to every frame.

106
00:05:50.830 --> 00:05:55.240
Like there's a guy like who some are Paul Horez,
a famous like tank of a guy.

107
00:05:55.241 --> 00:05:59.690
He's like five,
seven,
200 plus pounds and just rips guy's legs apart.

108
00:06:00.080 --> 00:06:05.080
And he uses this like short style to dive in on people's legs and get them in

109
00:06:05.081 --> 00:06:10.081
heal hooks and bars and rip their legs parties terrifying and that that style

110
00:06:10.431 --> 00:06:13.520
heavily favors being built like a little tank.

111
00:06:13.850 --> 00:06:17.540
Whereas like that long like you are,
you're a tall long guy,

112
00:06:17.720 --> 00:06:20.630
you would have like good Darce choke,

113
00:06:20.660 --> 00:06:24.920
good rear nakeds good or good arm bars,
good triangles.

114
00:06:25.040 --> 00:06:27.560
You would have lengthened leverage with that length.

115
00:06:27.561 --> 00:06:31.850
Especially with triangles cause long legged guys they can like sometimes a guy

116
00:06:31.851 --> 00:06:33.470
like me with short legs like I'll,

117
00:06:33.530 --> 00:06:37.910
I'll get my legs crossed and I have to adjust a lot to be able to cinch up by

118
00:06:37.911 --> 00:06:41.270
triangle.
Whereas you might be able to just close it up right there.

119
00:06:41.450 --> 00:06:45.590
So you'll have like more opportunities for triangles because the length of your

120
00:06:45.591 --> 00:06:49.310
limbs.
And have you,
would you have ever been at a point in your,

121
00:06:49.520 --> 00:06:52.340
in your career when you were doing to just where you,

122
00:06:52.910 --> 00:06:54.470
how would you have been in the UFC?

123
00:06:55.400 --> 00:06:59.060
Like it's your prime like I have no idea.
I'd have no idea.

124
00:06:59.330 --> 00:07:02.750
I would have had to have gotten way better.
Like when I was fighting,

125
00:07:02.751 --> 00:07:05.690
I was just kickboxing.
Yeah,
kickboxing.
And first of all,

126
00:07:05.720 --> 00:07:07.700
first it was taekwondo and then went to kickboxing.

127
00:07:07.730 --> 00:07:12.500
And by the time the UFC came around,
like on the ground,
I was useless.
Okay.

128
00:07:12.530 --> 00:07:16.250
There's a straight white belt.
I would get ripped apart every day.

129
00:07:16.251 --> 00:07:19.040
I would go to the gym and if I,
if I tapped anybody,

130
00:07:19.041 --> 00:07:23.240
like if it was like a week went by and I tapped one guy be like,
Woo,

131
00:07:23.241 --> 00:07:28.040
I fucking tapped the guy buddy.
There wasn't that many people doing it,
you know?

132
00:07:28.041 --> 00:07:30.800
So I was going with like,
there was a couple of white belts may be,

133
00:07:30.801 --> 00:07:33.620
and then there was like blue belts and purple belts and Brown belts and those

134
00:07:33.621 --> 00:07:37.280
guys would always tap me.
Got It.
So that's just how it went for a long time.

135
00:07:37.281 --> 00:07:38.570
When you are,
you know,

136
00:07:38.571 --> 00:07:42.440
unless you're some kind of freak like some big ass football player or some like

137
00:07:42.441 --> 00:07:46.220
super athlete,
you're probably not going to be behold,
hold these guys off.

138
00:07:46.330 --> 00:07:50.180
They're gonna,
they're gonna choke you.
Now.
Was it true?
You're gonna a fight.

139
00:07:50.181 --> 00:07:52.550
Wesley snipes.
That was way later though,
way later.

140
00:07:52.551 --> 00:07:55.940
That was a brown belt by then and I'd been doing a long for you beaten them.

141
00:07:56.510 --> 00:08:00.770
I don't know cause we never did ever deserve real martial artist,

142
00:08:01.020 --> 00:08:03.080
real martial arts.
But he doesn't know Jujitsu.

143
00:08:03.620 --> 00:08:06.860
The thing that must have been exciting though for super excited cause I was

144
00:08:06.861 --> 00:08:10.820
thinking like I knew that he was a real legitimate martial artists.

145
00:08:10.820 --> 00:08:13.730
Like he throws kicks and punches and it looks really good.

146
00:08:13.790 --> 00:08:17.180
Like he really does know his shit.
But I also know he never fought.

147
00:08:17.930 --> 00:08:22.160
And there's a big difference between throwing kicks and I and I haven't fought

148
00:08:22.161 --> 00:08:26.480
in a long time,
but I probably fought a hundred times.
Yeah.
So I,
I,

149
00:08:26.540 --> 00:08:29.960
I've been,
I've felt that nerves,
I know what that's like.

150
00:08:30.140 --> 00:08:33.920
It'll be crazy as fuck to do it again.
That's what I was thinking.
I'm like,

151
00:08:33.921 --> 00:08:37.810
it'll probably scare the shit out of me,
but I think I know what to do.
Like,

152
00:08:37.850 --> 00:08:41.390
I think I know how to like get in there and start fainting and start giving some

153
00:08:41.391 --> 00:08:44.660
movement and see how he reacts.
And then the worst case scenarios,

154
00:08:44.690 --> 00:08:48.350
like I'm like in a scramble,
I'm going to strangle this guy.
Like if this,

155
00:08:48.410 --> 00:08:53.410
if this comes to a scramble because the average person really doesn't know how

156
00:08:54.651 --> 00:08:59.610
helpless are until a Jujitsu black belt grabs a hold of you and then you just

157
00:08:59.611 --> 00:09:01.050
go,
oh shit.

158
00:09:01.320 --> 00:09:06.030
Like I'm helpless because in a fight you really think like you might be able to

159
00:09:06.031 --> 00:09:06.864
punch a guy.

160
00:09:06.870 --> 00:09:09.810
Like maybe if he's friendly and he's swinging at me and I'm swinging at him,

161
00:09:09.811 --> 00:09:13.530
maybe I hit him first.
You really think that,
but there's no swinging.

162
00:09:13.880 --> 00:09:16.230
If it's a Jujitsu fight,
if,
if,

163
00:09:16.410 --> 00:09:19.740
if you guys get into some sort of a tussle and that guy grabs you and trips you

164
00:09:19.741 --> 00:09:20.574
in,
boom,

165
00:09:20.580 --> 00:09:23.250
and he's on the ground with his hand on your Jack and a knee on your chest,

166
00:09:23.520 --> 00:09:28.400
you're a dead man.
You're a dead man because there's no lucky shots.

167
00:09:28.420 --> 00:09:28.830
Yeah,

168
00:09:28.830 --> 00:09:33.150
a Jujitsu black belt is just going to close the distance like that evil fucking

169
00:09:33.151 --> 00:09:33.984
crab.

170
00:09:33.990 --> 00:09:38.820
And he's just going to use your fucking neck and there's no way you're going to

171
00:09:38.821 --> 00:09:42.000
avoid it and there's no way you're going to survive it.
You're just not going to.

172
00:09:42.060 --> 00:09:45.610
That's why you don't fight people like five people and I'm just,

173
00:09:45.690 --> 00:09:48.150
you can't fight random people on the streets like when you're young.

174
00:09:48.151 --> 00:09:50.790
That was the thing that you could go to bars.
Yeah.
Like I,

175
00:09:50.791 --> 00:09:54.770
I had some friends that like to throw down when I was younger and I,

176
00:09:54.771 --> 00:09:56.700
I wouldn't do that.
I was watching but good for you.

177
00:09:56.701 --> 00:09:59.910
Now it's kind of like you've got to watch everybody because you don't know what

178
00:09:59.911 --> 00:10:00.810
kind of training they're doing.

179
00:10:00.840 --> 00:10:04.080
Like everybody is so educated on and it's so big right now.

180
00:10:04.110 --> 00:10:08.700
Well some guy fought off a guy in the subway that was attacking with a knife

181
00:10:08.701 --> 00:10:12.450
with some moves that he learned watching the UFC never even trained before he

182
00:10:12.451 --> 00:10:13.740
just knew what to do.
Yeah.

183
00:10:13.920 --> 00:10:18.120
He like knew what to do because he'd seen guys like get the mountain and drop

184
00:10:18.121 --> 00:10:21.990
ground and pound.
He like knew what to do based on watching it.
Yeah.

185
00:10:22.600 --> 00:10:24.580
I think is good.
Like when you mentioned,

186
00:10:24.610 --> 00:10:28.950
I think it's good just to learn so you would feel better about yourself in case

187
00:10:28.951 --> 00:10:33.330
danger comes.
Yeah,
man.
You want to be the person that gets to make the decision.

188
00:10:33.510 --> 00:10:34.500
Here's the thing,
right?

189
00:10:34.680 --> 00:10:37.710
If you don't know how to fight and there's some drunk asshole who doesn't know

190
00:10:37.711 --> 00:10:38.640
how to fight either,

191
00:10:38.641 --> 00:10:41.340
but he might come over and punch you in the face and sucker punch you and he

192
00:10:41.341 --> 00:10:43.770
could hurt you or knock you out in front of your woman.

193
00:10:44.220 --> 00:10:46.200
You want to be the one who gets to decide.

194
00:10:46.590 --> 00:10:51.240
If I'm in a situation in some guy and he's like reasonably close to my size and

195
00:10:51.241 --> 00:10:53.670
he's being an asshole and he's drunk and he gets aggressive with me,

196
00:10:53.700 --> 00:10:58.080
I can decide what to do with him.
Like I can,
it gets,

197
00:10:58.140 --> 00:10:59.580
I don't want to hurt anybody,

198
00:10:59.670 --> 00:11:04.670
but I'm not gonna let you hurt me and you get to decide like you don't want.

199
00:11:04.860 --> 00:11:05.590
Like you've,

200
00:11:05.590 --> 00:11:10.500
we've all seen these seven 11 fucking parking lot fights on youtube or some

201
00:11:10.560 --> 00:11:12.210
asshole and both of them don't know how to fight,

202
00:11:12.211 --> 00:11:14.070
but one guy might fuck that guy up.

203
00:11:14.071 --> 00:11:17.280
He might kick them in the face while he's down.
He don't want to be that guy,

204
00:11:17.490 --> 00:11:19.070
but you don't want to be in that situation.

205
00:11:19.090 --> 00:11:21.820
Definitely walk away whenever you can.
Always.
