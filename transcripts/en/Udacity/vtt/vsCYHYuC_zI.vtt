00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.000
Welcome back to statistics.

00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:06.000
Today we do a case study in regression.

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:10.000
In this case study, I will use again the data that you all submitted

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:16.000
about my current weight called L and my previous weight from last year

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:19.000
as you guessed it all in kilograms called P.

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:23.000
Here is my question for you as a well-trained statistician.

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:25.000
What is the very first thing I'll do?

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:29.000
Compute the mean, the variance, and similar simple statistics?

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:31.000
Run a scatterplot?

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:35.000
Or go straight to the end and run my regression methods

00:00:35.000 --> 99:59:59.000
to see what's the best line that fits the data? Pick one.
