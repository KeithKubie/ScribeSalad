00:00:00.390 --> 00:00:05.229
Scientists want to use sperm to treat tumors
in women’s vaginas!?

00:00:05.229 --> 00:00:06.509
That’s right.

00:00:06.509 --> 00:00:08.069
Buckle up people.

00:00:08.069 --> 00:00:11.770
Gynecological cancers are really hard to treat
. And with over one million women diagnosed

00:00:11.770 --> 00:00:16.720
every year, researchers are looking for some
kind of drug delivery method that can survive

00:00:16.720 --> 00:00:19.920
in the harsh environments of the vagina, cervix,
and uterus.

00:00:19.920 --> 00:00:25.510
It also needs to be able to quickly propel
itself towards a tumor, without diluting the

00:00:25.510 --> 00:00:26.830
drug itself.

00:00:26.830 --> 00:00:31.210
One group of researchers realized they didn’t
have to look very far to find such a thing

00:00:31.210 --> 00:00:36.149
because living, breathing mammals naturally
make something that thrives in that environment…

00:00:36.149 --> 00:00:37.440
Sperm.

00:00:37.440 --> 00:00:42.290
Sperm are evolutionarily programmed to travel
through the reproductive system and now scientists

00:00:42.290 --> 00:00:43.920
are using this to their advantage.

00:00:43.920 --> 00:00:49.679
They’re testing bionic bovine sperm to deliver
cancer-treating drugs directly to tumors.

00:00:49.679 --> 00:00:51.300
So, how does this method work?

00:00:51.300 --> 00:00:56.500
First, researchers take the bovine sperm and
soak them in doxorubicin, which is a type

00:00:56.500 --> 00:00:58.230
of chemotherapy drug.

00:00:58.230 --> 00:01:05.229
Then, a 3D-printed iron harness is microscopically
fitted onto the sperm.

00:01:05.229 --> 00:01:12.770
Sperm themselves are only like .002 inches,
so imagine how tiny that harness would be!

00:01:12.770 --> 00:01:16.720
The armored sperm would then be inserted into
the patient's reproductive system.

00:01:16.720 --> 00:01:20.570
Once the sperm are inside, the researchers
use magnets to guide the iron-clad sperm to

00:01:20.570 --> 00:01:23.030
the drug drop-off point, a tumor.

00:01:23.030 --> 00:01:27.909
Then, the bionic suit releases the sperm,
allowing it to swim into the cancerous tumor

00:01:27.909 --> 00:01:30.280
and deliver the drug to the problem
area.

00:01:30.280 --> 00:01:35.060
At that point, the drug fights to the death,
hoping to overpower and destroy the cancer

00:01:35.060 --> 00:01:36.340
cell.

00:01:36.340 --> 00:01:40.590
Doxorubicin is a pretty effective drug sometimes
used for cancer treatment.

00:01:40.590 --> 00:01:45.689
The struggle has been finding the right delivery
method for the strongest doses, but still

00:01:45.689 --> 00:01:50.800
maintaining potency and without damaging nearby
cells. It's not exactly targeted on its own.

00:01:50.800 --> 00:01:54.690
And while this drug delivery method may sound
pretty ridiculous (which it kind of is) and

00:01:54.690 --> 00:01:59.501
it’s still only effective in the lab, it
could be what scientists, doctors and patients

00:01:59.501 --> 00:02:01.320
have all been waiting for.

00:02:01.320 --> 00:02:05.399
Now this is obviously a pretty farfetched
use of sperm but scientists are looking into

00:02:05.399 --> 00:02:09.800
other ways sperm can help treat various medical
conditions.

00:02:09.800 --> 00:02:14.000
Similar methods of sperm-assisted drug delivery
have the potential to treat gynecological

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:19.209
diseases like endometriosis and pelvic inflammatory
disease, but also other diseases throughout

00:02:19.209 --> 00:02:20.209
the body.

00:02:20.209 --> 00:02:24.519
And scientists are using sperm as inspiration
for nanobots that could help clear clogged

00:02:24.519 --> 00:02:26.310
arteries within the body!

00:02:26.310 --> 00:02:30.860
More research is definitely needed but it
seems like sperm could be used for a whole

00:02:30.860 --> 00:02:34.350
lot more than just makin’ babies.

00:02:34.350 --> 00:02:38.180
Microscopic mini machines that can do all
sorts of things in our body is very Honey

00:02:38.180 --> 00:02:40.019
I Shrunk The Kids … wanna know more?

00:02:40.019 --> 00:02:41.790
We’ve got a whole video on them right here.

00:02:41.790 --> 00:02:44.519
What do you guys think of these iron-clad
swimmers?

00:02:44.519 --> 00:02:47.290
