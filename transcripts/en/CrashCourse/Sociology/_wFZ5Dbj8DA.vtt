00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.840
“If all your friends jumped off a bridge,
would you jump too?"

00:00:02.840 --> 00:00:07.800
It’s the lament of many an exasperated parent,
but it’s also a kind of profound sociological question.

00:00:07.800 --> 00:00:11.150
Because, when you're talking to your parents,
the answer's always no.

00:00:11.150 --> 00:00:15.020
But, with the right group of friends, you might
be quite happy to take a dive in the water.

00:00:15.020 --> 00:00:19.700
The thing is, you're a different person when
you're a part of a group, and you're a different
person in different groups.

00:00:19.700 --> 00:00:25.160
A family, a group of friends out for a swim,
a business meeting, and a choir are different
kinds of groups.

00:00:25.160 --> 00:00:27.640
And the same person can be a member of all
of them.

00:00:27.650 --> 00:00:31.900
So if we want to understand how these groups
are different, and even how they're similar,

00:00:31.900 --> 00:00:38.720
we need to talk about what social groups are,
and why they matter, both to the people who are
a part of them, and to the people who aren't.

00:00:38.720 --> 00:00:49.840
[Theme Music]

00:00:49.840 --> 00:00:54.000
The choir, the meeting, the friends, and the
family are all examples of social groups.

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:59.800
A social group is simply a collection of people
who have something in common and who believe
that what they have in common is significant.

00:00:59.800 --> 00:01:05.060
In other words, a group is partly defined
by the fact that its members feel like they're
part of a group.

00:01:05.060 --> 00:01:07.470
This is obviously a pretty broad definition.

00:01:07.470 --> 00:01:13.000
But it does have its limits, and you can see
these limits if you compare social groups
to aggregates and categories.

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:17.140
An aggregate is a set of individuals who happen
to be in the same place at the same time.

00:01:17.140 --> 00:01:21.620
All the people passing through Grand Central Station
at 1:00 on a Friday afternoon are an aggregate,

00:01:21.620 --> 00:01:24.960
but they aren't a group, because they don't
share a sense of belonging.

00:01:24.960 --> 00:01:29.810
Categories, meanwhile, consist of one particular
kind of person across time and space.

00:01:29.810 --> 00:01:32.720
They’re sets of people who share similar
characteristics.

00:01:32.720 --> 00:01:34.680
Racial categories are a simple example.

00:01:34.680 --> 00:01:39.090
So the sense of feeling like you belong to
a group is a defining feature of a group.

00:01:39.090 --> 00:01:44.980
But it also helps you differentiate kinds
of groups, specifically between primary and
secondary groups.

00:01:44.980 --> 00:01:49.420
Primary groups are small and tightly knit,
bound by a very strong sense of belonging.

00:01:49.420 --> 00:01:51.460
Family and friendship groups are primary groups.

00:01:51.460 --> 00:01:56.040
They’re mutually supportive places where
members can turn for emotional, social, and
financial help.

00:01:56.040 --> 00:01:59.670
And as far as group members are concerned,
the group is an end-in-itself.

00:01:59.670 --> 00:02:02.900
It exists to be a group, not for any other
purpose.

00:02:02.900 --> 00:02:05.200
Secondary groups, however, are the reverse.

00:02:05.200 --> 00:02:12.400
These are large and impersonal groups, whose
members are bound primarily by a shared goal
or activity, rather than by strong emotional ties.

00:02:12.400 --> 00:02:14.940
A company is a good example of a secondary group:

00:02:14.940 --> 00:02:20.900
Employees are often loosely or formally
connected to one another through their jobs,
and they tend to know little about each other.

00:02:20.900 --> 00:02:23.900
So there’s a sense of belonging there, but
it's much more limited.

00:02:23.900 --> 00:02:26.900
That's not to say that coworkers never have
emotional relationships.

00:02:26.900 --> 00:02:34.380
In fact, secondary groups can become primary
groups over time, as a set of coworkers spends time
together and becomes a primary group of friends.

00:02:34.380 --> 00:02:40.200
And while a gang of friends and a company
clearly have a lot of differences, they also have
at least one major similarity:

00:02:40.200 --> 00:02:44.680
They're both voluntary –  if you belong to
that group, it’s because you choose to join.

00:02:44.680 --> 00:02:48.020
But there are also plenty of involuntary groups,
in which membership is assigned.

00:02:48.020 --> 00:02:51.680
Prisoners in a prison are members of an involuntary
group, as are conscripted soldiers.

00:02:51.680 --> 00:02:55.820
Now that we understand a little bit about
what groups are, we can start to study how
they work –

00:02:55.820 --> 00:03:00.640
beginning with group dynamics,
or the way that individuals affect groups,
and groups affect individuals.

00:03:00.640 --> 00:03:05.600
If we want to think about how individuals
affect groups, a good place to start is with
leadership.

00:03:05.600 --> 00:03:11.460
Not all groups have formally assigned leaders,
but even groups that don't, often have de facto
leaders, like parents in a family.

00:03:11.460 --> 00:03:14.240
A leader is just someone who influences other
people in the group.

00:03:14.240 --> 00:03:16.460
And there are generally two types of leadership:

00:03:16.460 --> 00:03:21.620
an instrumental leader is focused on a
group's goals, giving orders and making
plans in order to achieve those goals.

00:03:21.620 --> 00:03:26.720
An expressive leader, by contrast, is looking
to increase harmony and minimize conflict
within the group.

00:03:26.720 --> 00:03:31.460
They aren't focused on any particular goal,
they’re just trying to promote the wellbeing
of the group’s members.

00:03:31.460 --> 00:03:36.540
And just as leaders may differ in what they’re
trying to do, so too can they go about doing
it in different ways.

00:03:36.550 --> 00:03:39.480
I’m talking here about leadership styles,
of which we have three.

00:03:39.480 --> 00:03:44.740
Authoritarian leaders lead by giving orders
and setting down rules which they expect the
group to follow.

00:03:44.740 --> 00:03:50.140
Such a leader earns respect, and can be
effective in a crisis, but at the expense of affection
from group members.

00:03:50.140 --> 00:03:53.800
Democratic leaders on the other hand, lead
by trying to reach a consensus.

00:03:53.800 --> 00:03:57.380
Instead of issuing orders, they consider all
viewpoints to try and reach a decision.

00:03:57.380 --> 00:04:04.960
Such leaders are less effective during a crisis,
but, because of the variety of different viewpoints
they consider, they often find more creative
solutions to problems.

00:04:04.960 --> 00:04:08.100
And they’re more likely to receive affection
from their group’s members.

00:04:08.100 --> 00:04:10.960
Finally, laissez-faire leaders do the least
leading.

00:04:10.960 --> 00:04:14.820
They’re extremely permissive, and mostly
leave the group to function on its own.

00:04:14.820 --> 00:04:20.920
This means lots of freedom, but it’s the
least effective style at promoting group solidarity
and least effective in times of crisis.

00:04:20.920 --> 00:04:25.559
So, leadership is one way that individuals
affect groups, but groups also affect individuals.

00:04:25.560 --> 00:04:30.800
You can see this especially clearly in group
conformity, where members of a group hew to
the group’s norms and standards.

00:04:30.800 --> 00:04:34.680
Basically, group conformity is the reason that
you do jump off the bridge with your friends.

00:04:34.680 --> 00:04:37.660
And this has been demonstrated in some fascinating
experimental results.

00:04:37.660 --> 00:04:42.960
Let’s go to the Thought Bubble to learn
about perhaps the most famous – or infamous
– experiment on conformity.

00:04:42.960 --> 00:04:47.320
The Milgram Experiment was run by American
psychologist Stanley Milgram in 1974,

00:04:47.320 --> 00:04:51.740
and it was presented as an experiment in
punishment and learning, with two participants.

00:04:51.740 --> 00:04:59.600
One participant was the teacher, who read aloud a series of word pairs and then asked the other participant, the student, seated in another room, to recall them.

00:04:59.610 --> 00:05:03.180
The student was strapped to a chair and wired
up with electrodes.

00:05:03.180 --> 00:05:11.340
For each wrong answer, the experimenter, who was standing beside the teacher, instructed the teacher to deliver a painful electric shock to the student.

00:05:11.340 --> 00:05:18.520
With each wrong answer, the intensity increased,
from an unpleasant few volts up to 450 volts,
a potentially deadly shock.

00:05:18.520 --> 00:05:21.379
But the experiment was not about punishment
or learning.

00:05:21.380 --> 00:05:26.620
The student was actually an actor, a confederate
of the experimenter, and the shocks were not real.

00:05:26.620 --> 00:05:30.740
The experiment was designed to test how far
the teacher would go in conforming to authority.

00:05:30.740 --> 00:05:36.160
At some point in the experiment, the confederate
would feign extreme pain and beg the teacher to stop.

00:05:36.160 --> 00:05:37.640
Then he fell silent.

00:05:37.640 --> 00:05:42.820
If at any point the teacher refused to issue
the shock, the experimenter would insist that
he continue.

00:05:42.820 --> 00:05:49.140
In the end, 65% of participants went all the
way, administering the presumably deadly
450 volt shock.

00:05:49.140 --> 00:05:53.900
And this is usually given as proof that
people tend to follow orders, but there’s a lot
more to it than that.

00:05:53.900 --> 00:06:00.660
If the experimenter gave direct orders to the teacher,
like “You must continue, you have no other choice,”
that resulted in non-compliance.

00:06:00.660 --> 00:06:03.080
That’s when the teacher was
more likely to refuse.

00:06:03.080 --> 00:06:08.260
The prods that did produce compliance were
the ones that appealed, instead, to the value
of the experiment –

00:06:08.260 --> 00:06:13.440
the ones that said administering the
shocks was necessary for the experiment to be
successful and worthwhile.

00:06:13.440 --> 00:06:19.120
So in this instance, the value of the experiment,
of science, was a strongly held group value,

00:06:19.120 --> 00:06:23.180
and it helped convince the subjects to continue,
even though they might not have wanted to.

00:06:23.180 --> 00:06:24.340
Thanks, Thought Bubble.

00:06:24.340 --> 00:06:30.600
This idea of group values points us to another
important concept in understanding conformity:
the idea of groupthink.

00:06:30.600 --> 00:06:37.140
Groupthink is the narrowing of thought in
a group, by which its members come to believe
that there is only one possible correct answer.

00:06:37.140 --> 00:06:43.080
Moreover, in a groupthink mentality, to even suggest
alternatives is a sign of disloyalty to the group.

00:06:43.080 --> 00:06:46.500
Another way of understanding group conformity
is to think about reference groups.

00:06:46.500 --> 00:06:50.499
Reference groups are groups we use as standards
to judge ourselves and others.

00:06:50.500 --> 00:06:54.160
What’s "normal" for you is determined partly
by your reference groups.

00:06:54.160 --> 00:06:57.600
In-groups are reference groups that you feel
loyalty to, and that you identify with.

00:06:57.600 --> 00:07:03.780
But you can compare yourself to out-groups,
too, which are groups that you feel antagonism
toward, and which you don't identify with.

00:07:03.780 --> 00:07:08.100
And another aspect of a social group that can
affect its impacts and dynamics is its size.

00:07:08.100 --> 00:07:13.240
And here, the general rule is: the larger the
group, the more stable, but less intimate, it is.

00:07:13.240 --> 00:07:18.000
A group of two people is obviously the
smallest and most intimate kind of group,
but it’s also the least stable.

00:07:18.000 --> 00:07:20.740
Because, if one person leaves, there’s no
group anymore.

00:07:20.740 --> 00:07:26.460
Larger groups are more stable, and if there
are disagreements among members, other members
are around who can mediate between them.

00:07:26.460 --> 00:07:32.200
But big groups also are prone to coalitions
forming within them, which can result with
one faction aligning against another.

00:07:32.200 --> 00:07:36.640
The size of a group matters in other ways,
too, for instance in terms of social diversity.

00:07:36.640 --> 00:07:42.760
Larger homogenous groups tend to turn inward,
concentrating relationships within the group
instead of relying on intergroup contacts.

00:07:42.760 --> 00:07:50.080
By contrast, heterogenous groups, or groups that
have more diversity within them, turn outward, with
its members more likely to interact with outsiders.

00:07:50.080 --> 00:07:54.600
Finally, it’s worth pointing out that social
groups aren’t just separate clumps of people.

00:07:54.600 --> 00:07:57.520
There's another way to understand groups,
in terms of social networks.

00:07:57.520 --> 00:08:01.040
This perspective sees people as nodes that
are all socially interconnected.

00:08:01.040 --> 00:08:04.800
You can imagine a "circle of friends" who are
all connected to each other in different ways,

00:08:04.800 --> 00:08:09.680
some with strong connections in a clique or
subgroup, while some are connected by much
weaker ties.

00:08:09.680 --> 00:08:15.960
And you can follow the ties between all of the nodes
outward, to friends-of-friends and acquaintances
who exist on the periphery of the network.

00:08:15.960 --> 00:08:19.460
Networks are important, because even their
weak ties can be useful.

00:08:19.460 --> 00:08:24.480
Think of the last time you were networking,
following every connection you had to, say,
land a job interview.

00:08:24.480 --> 00:08:28.649
Regardless of whether you think about groups
as networks and ties, or as bounded sets,

00:08:28.649 --> 00:08:32.200
it's clear that they have important impacts
on people, both inside and outside.

00:08:32.200 --> 00:08:37.400
If you just looked at society as a bunch of
individuals, you’d miss all the ways that groups
impact our lives –

00:08:37.400 --> 00:08:42.160
by acting as reference groups,
by influencing our decisions through
group conformity, and much more.

00:08:42.160 --> 00:08:45.480
And groups are important for how society itself
is organized.

00:08:45.480 --> 00:08:50.920
So next time, we're gonna talk about one big
part of that: formal organizations and bureaucracy.

00:08:50.920 --> 00:08:52.740
For now, we’ve learned about social groups.

00:08:52.740 --> 00:08:55.709
We talked about what social groups are and
the different kinds of groups.

00:08:55.709 --> 00:09:01.310
Then we discussed group dynamics: how individuals
affect groups and how groups affect individuals.

00:09:01.310 --> 00:09:06.180
We learned about leadership, group conformity,
reference groups, and the impacts of group size.

00:09:06.180 --> 00:09:09.760
And finally, we talked about groups as networks
and why networks matter.

00:09:09.760 --> 00:09:16.430
