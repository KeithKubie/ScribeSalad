00:00:00.140 --> 00:00:07.370
I love my pizza as much as the next girl,
it totally counts as a vegetable right?

00:00:07.370 --> 00:00:14.520
It wasn’t that long ago when the US Congress
declared pizza as a source of some of your

00:00:14.520 --> 00:00:16.080
daily vegetable intake.

00:00:16.080 --> 00:00:20.910
The bill proposed back in 2011 allowed the
USDA to count two tablespoons of tomato paste

00:00:20.910 --> 00:00:22.279
as a vegetable.

00:00:22.279 --> 00:00:23.429
But as bad as that sounds.

00:00:23.429 --> 00:00:26.640
That’s exactly how most Americans are getting
their vegetables.

00:00:26.640 --> 00:00:31.119
So the thing is, the USDA recommends that
we eat about 2.5 to 3 cups of vegetables a

00:00:31.119 --> 00:00:35.500
day, but a recent survey from the Centers
for Disease control found that 87% of adults

00:00:35.500 --> 00:00:36.500
don’t get that much.

00:00:36.500 --> 00:00:40.320
Instead, the vegetables we do eat like tomatoes
and potatoes are in the form of processed

00:00:40.320 --> 00:00:42.879
foods like French Fries and tomato paste on
pizza.

00:00:42.879 --> 00:00:46.840
But even if things change and people start
eating healthy now, there’s a bigger problem.

00:00:46.840 --> 00:00:49.769
There’s simply not enough veggies to go
around.

00:00:49.769 --> 00:00:54.609
Recently the USDA found that only 1.7 cups
of veggies are available for every person.

00:00:54.609 --> 00:00:56.480
And not even the kind that’s recommend.

00:00:56.480 --> 00:00:58.829
Daily recommendations promote a variety of
veggies.

00:00:58.829 --> 00:01:01.589
From dark leafy greens to colorful veggies
and tasty legumes.

00:01:01.589 --> 00:01:06.490
A recent report by the USDA found that potatoes,
tomatoes, and lettuce make up close to 60

00:01:06.490 --> 00:01:08.640
percent of U.S. vegetable availability.

00:01:08.640 --> 00:01:12.500
Unfortunately, most of those produce are set
for processing into less healthy foods like

00:01:12.500 --> 00:01:14.710
potato chips and tomato sauces.

00:01:14.710 --> 00:01:16.640
So what are farmers growing?

00:01:16.640 --> 00:01:22.360
Well the top five most common crops in America
are corn, soybeans, hay, wheat and cotton.

00:01:22.360 --> 00:01:27.189
Of the 300 million acres of farmland used
for food, only a small portion, 14 million

00:01:27.189 --> 00:01:31.040
acres, are used for fruits and veggies and
that includes the stuff we grow for processed

00:01:31.040 --> 00:01:32.210
foods like chips.

00:01:32.210 --> 00:01:35.689
And they aren’t growing these crops to meet
demands of American appetites, a lot of it

00:01:35.689 --> 00:01:39.030
has less to do with the nation’s food habits
and more to do with price.

00:01:39.030 --> 00:01:42.079
The Federal government heavily subsidizes
crops like corn.

00:01:42.079 --> 00:01:45.829
Which might be good for the food supply except
most of it doesn’t get eaten by people.

00:01:45.829 --> 00:01:49.650
According to the National Corn Growers Association,
about eighty percent of all corn grown in

00:01:49.650 --> 00:01:53.880
the U.S. is consumed by domestic and overseas
livestock, poultry, and fish production.

00:01:53.880 --> 00:01:59.130
Only 12% of corn is consumed directly or indirectly
as corn syrup for things like soda.

00:01:59.130 --> 00:02:02.920
Farmers grow whatever crops are the most profitable,
and that doesn’t always mean food.

00:02:02.920 --> 00:02:07.290
Like in 2011 a lot of Southern farmers switched
from growing food to growing cotton as the

00:02:07.290 --> 00:02:08.920
price of cotton soared.

00:02:08.920 --> 00:02:12.610
Webb Wallace, executive director of the Cotton
and Grain Producers of the Lower Rio Grande

00:02:12.610 --> 00:02:16.230
Valley said that “It’s good for the farmer,
but from a humanitarian perspective it’s

00:02:16.230 --> 00:02:17.319
kind of scary.”

00:02:17.319 --> 00:02:18.910
And well this isn’t new.

00:02:18.910 --> 00:02:21.360
Americans have always prized profit over produce.

00:02:21.360 --> 00:02:25.250
Some of the earliest settlers grew crops like
tobacco that they could sell rather than food

00:02:25.250 --> 00:02:26.660
they could survive on.

00:02:26.660 --> 00:02:27.660
As a result.

00:02:27.660 --> 00:02:28.720
Well a lot of people starved.

00:02:28.720 --> 00:02:32.230
So it’s clear our agricultural system needs
a bit of an overhaul.

00:02:32.230 --> 00:02:34.400
And we could do our part to demand more yummy
veggies.

00:02:34.400 --> 00:02:36.300
And thankfully veggies are becoming trendy.

00:02:36.300 --> 00:02:39.810
One of the most popular leafy greens of late
is Kale.

00:02:39.810 --> 00:02:43.110
How did Kale become such a super veg and just
how good for you is it?

00:02:43.110 --> 00:02:54.450
Check out this video to find out more.

00:02:54.450 --> 00:02:56.269
So the question is, what veggies are your
favorite?

00:02:56.269 --> 00:03:05.129
I’m a weirdo and really love brussel sprouts.
