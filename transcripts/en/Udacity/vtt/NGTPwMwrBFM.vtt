00:00:03.010 --> 00:00:05.700

00:00:05.700 --> 00:00:08.350
tunes and Disney songs is a learned trait. Because it's

00:00:08.350 --> 00:00:10.120
what I was exposed to as I was growing up.

00:00:10.120 --> 00:00:13.190

00:00:13.190 --> 00:00:15.740
Steve Miller Band. But we all have our own taste.
