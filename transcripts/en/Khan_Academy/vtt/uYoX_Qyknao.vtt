00:00:00.697 --> 00:00:02.415
- [Voiceover] Hello,
Grammarians, and hello, Paige.

00:00:02.415 --> 00:00:03.297
- [Voiceover] Hi, David.

00:00:03.297 --> 00:00:05.155
- [Voiceover] So, we're gonna talk about

00:00:05.155 --> 00:00:07.209
using commas in dialogue.

00:00:07.209 --> 00:00:09.114
So I've got these two sentences here

00:00:09.114 --> 00:00:12.179
that I have removed all
the punctuation from

00:00:12.179 --> 00:00:15.104
because I recognize that figuring out

00:00:15.104 --> 00:00:17.682
where to put commas when you are reporting

00:00:17.682 --> 00:00:19.493
someone else's speech, you know,

00:00:19.493 --> 00:00:22.558
for a newspaper article
or a piece of fiction

00:00:22.558 --> 00:00:24.114
or whatever it is,

00:00:24.114 --> 00:00:26.031
can be quite confusing.

00:00:26.900 --> 00:00:30.151
And so here's basically
what you need to know

00:00:30.151 --> 00:00:33.402
is that commas in dialogue
essentially function

00:00:33.402 --> 00:00:34.725
as runways.

00:00:34.725 --> 00:00:36.931
It can ramp you up to get going

00:00:36.931 --> 00:00:38.069
for an utterance

00:00:38.069 --> 00:00:40.319
and take you down and land.

00:00:41.575 --> 00:00:44.803
Paige, would you read me this sentence?

00:00:44.803 --> 00:00:46.823
- [Voiceover] "Guillermo
said, I have no idea

00:00:46.823 --> 00:00:48.309
"where I put that moonstone."

00:00:48.309 --> 00:00:51.072
- [Voiceover] So, we're
starting into this sentence,

00:00:51.072 --> 00:00:53.998
and we're gonna use this comma as a ramp

00:00:53.998 --> 00:00:56.645
to divide between the utterance

00:00:56.645 --> 00:00:58.642
and what's called the dialogue tag.

00:00:58.642 --> 00:01:00.360
"So Guillermo said," comma,

00:01:00.360 --> 00:01:02.612
"I have no idea where
I put that moonstone."

00:01:02.612 --> 00:01:03.889
This is the end of his utterance.

00:01:03.889 --> 00:01:05.584
We're gonna put a period here.

00:01:05.584 --> 00:01:08.208
However, sentence number two--

00:01:08.208 --> 00:01:09.648
- [Voiceover] "They're probably pirates,

00:01:09.648 --> 00:01:11.134
"Roxane said."

00:01:11.134 --> 00:01:12.365
- [Voiceover] So here, since we're putting

00:01:12.365 --> 00:01:15.662
the dialogue tag after
the reported speech,

00:01:15.662 --> 00:01:18.913
this were otherwise going to be a period.

00:01:18.913 --> 00:01:21.188
We're gonna put a comma here.

00:01:21.188 --> 00:01:22.883
"They're probably pirates,"

00:01:22.883 --> 00:01:25.300
comma, "Roxane said," period.

00:01:26.970 --> 00:01:27.803
And why is this?

00:01:27.803 --> 00:01:29.524
It's because we're trying to separate

00:01:29.524 --> 00:01:31.428
between the reported speech

00:01:31.428 --> 00:01:34.052
and the dialogue tag itself.

00:01:34.052 --> 00:01:35.385
So, in the event

00:01:36.931 --> 00:01:39.848
that this were a question, however,

00:01:41.506 --> 00:01:43.317
you would use a question mark

00:01:43.317 --> 00:01:45.407
or if it were an exclamation,

00:01:45.407 --> 00:01:46.614
you would use an exclamation point,

00:01:46.614 --> 00:01:49.075
but if it were going to just be a period,

00:01:49.075 --> 00:01:50.027
you wouldn't do this.

00:01:50.027 --> 00:01:51.537
You wouldn't say, "They're
probably pirates,"

00:01:51.537 --> 00:01:53.371
period, "Roxane said."

00:01:53.371 --> 00:01:55.414
You would say, "They're probably pirates,"

00:01:55.414 --> 00:01:57.164
comma, "Roxane said."

00:01:58.294 --> 00:01:59.803
- [Voiceover] Yeah.

00:01:59.803 --> 00:02:02.172
- [Voiceover] I know
that's kinda confusing.

00:02:02.172 --> 00:02:06.839
But that is the style that
we abide by in English.

00:02:06.839 --> 00:02:07.791
- [Voiceover] Right, so as you said,

00:02:07.791 --> 00:02:10.252
comma with dialogue is pretty much

00:02:10.252 --> 00:02:11.390
acting as a runway.

00:02:11.390 --> 00:02:12.223
- [Voiceover] Okay.

00:02:12.223 --> 00:02:13.480
- [Voiceover] So with the first sentence,

00:02:13.480 --> 00:02:15.511
"Guillermo said," comma, and then--

00:02:15.511 --> 00:02:17.067
- [Voiceover] So just
kinda like, take off--

00:02:17.067 --> 00:02:18.019
- [Voiceover] Right, you're getting like,

00:02:18.019 --> 00:02:20.364
ramped up into the dialogue,

00:02:20.364 --> 00:02:21.525
and then with the second one,

00:02:21.525 --> 00:02:23.661
it's like the plane is landing,

00:02:23.661 --> 00:02:26.958
and, "They're probably pirates,"

00:02:26.958 --> 00:02:28.514
and then the dialogue ends.

00:02:28.514 --> 00:02:29.347
- [Voiceover] Cool.

00:02:29.347 --> 00:02:30.290
- [Voiceover] But there
has to be a comma in there

00:02:30.290 --> 00:02:31.521
to end it.

00:02:31.521 --> 00:02:32.914
- [Voiceover] So if the
statement were going

00:02:32.914 --> 00:02:33.819
to end with a period,

00:02:33.819 --> 00:02:35.398
we'd use a comma in reported dialogue

00:02:35.398 --> 00:02:37.976
when the tag follows the reported speech.

00:02:37.976 --> 00:02:38.809
- [Voiceover] That's right.

00:02:38.809 --> 00:02:39.880
- [Voiceover] Otherwise,
we'd use all the other

00:02:39.880 --> 00:02:42.620
relevant punctuation marks.

00:02:42.620 --> 00:02:43.453
- [Voiceover] Yeah.

00:02:43.453 --> 00:02:45.290
- [Voiceover] Okay, cool.

00:02:45.290 --> 00:02:46.904
So this is like the only time ever

00:02:46.904 --> 00:02:49.388
when you can end a sentence with a comma.

00:02:49.388 --> 00:02:50.851
- [Voiceover] Yeah, pretty much.

00:02:50.851 --> 00:02:52.384
- [Voiceover] Woah, that's awesome.

00:02:52.384 --> 00:02:54.009
- [Voiceover] Yeah.

00:02:54.009 --> 00:02:56.563
- [Voiceover] So that's how
you use commas in dialogue.

00:02:56.563 --> 00:02:57.956
You can learn anything.

00:02:57.956 --> 00:02:58.792
David out.

00:02:58.792 --> 00:02:59.672
- [Voiceover] Paige out.
