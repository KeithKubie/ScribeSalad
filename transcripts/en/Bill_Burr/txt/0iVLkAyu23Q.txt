Speaker 1:          00:00:02       Hey, what's going on? It's bill bird. It's time for the Thursday afternoon. Just before Friday, Monday morning podcast and

Speaker 2:          00:00:10       ah,

Speaker 1:          00:00:10       just checking in. Oh, you, what's going on? How are Ya? There's some happy people out there. There's some sad people out. There was a wonderful couple of days of soccer. Here are the World Cop, France or Hall Beats Belgium and England falls to Croatia. It's coming, omits calming. Oh my folly. Looked it up to see like why do they keep saying

Speaker 3:          00:00:39       that it's coming home?

Speaker 1:          00:00:41       You know, I immediately assume like, well obviously England must've won the most championships and this is their arrogant fucking way of being like, yeah, this is where it rightfully belongs. Kind of like when the Yankees win a world series and then all those fucking talking heads on on Espn logo and everything is all is right in baseball again. It's why. Why? Because a toward had million dollar team on a fucking play off series play off.

Speaker 3:          00:01:14       Turns out that's not what it is. Evidently the game of soccer now this might our football footie, whatever the fuck you call it. Evidently it was according to the English. It was created in England. They were the ones who decided despite the fact that you have four limbs, you can only use two. They wanted a degree of difficulty. They weren't like the animals over here. You know where we get bored and they're like, pick it up, you know, tackle them, which meant jump on his back and throw him to the fucking ground. I now tackle over there as you trip somebody, you stick your foot out in your triple. So evidently it started over there. That's what they're saying. So that's what it meant because I thought it meant that they had the most championships. And then I looked up all time World Cup champions. All right.

Speaker 3:          00:02:06       What you gotta do? How the fuck do you not to do? I don't give a fuck what the sport is. I want to know who dominated. Turns out Brazil since 1930 they won the most. They've won five 58 60 to 70 94 2002 which is a fucking lot considering it's every four years. How many have there been? One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 1520. This is a 21st one. They've won 21, like whatever fucking was at 20% of 25% of them than Germany. Auntie. Yeah, they, they got for Italy has four. Oh, they should have had five in [inaudible] 94 I remember that one. Uh, Argentina hand, God, that guy, whatever his name was. Uh, the hell was that guy's name? Diego or some shit. What the fuck was his name? I used to know his name.

Speaker 4:          00:03:02       Okay.

Speaker 3:          00:03:02       And were those fucking names where it's just like the second they gave him that his name is just like, pussy is going to be rated down on this guy. Right. Um, I forget the hand to God guy. That guy, it was weird. He was like in shape and he also look fat. What the fuck was his name?

Speaker 4:          00:03:19       Okay.

Speaker 3:          00:03:21       Diego Era Gamo was something like that. I can't fucking remember. Then. Uh, I got my hope. I say this right. I always, always was Uruguay urgh away, won it twice. And then England, France, and Spain of all one at once. That's interesting cause I thought Spain was a powerhouse and I would've thought in England when a bunch way back in the day when it's probably just a bunch of white guys running around. Right? Yeah. I also don't want, so that's why they say it's coming home. It's not some arrogant shit. It's like, Hey, you know, this game at the whole world loves, you know, not to pat ourselves on the back, but guess what? We came up with it. It's our shit. Okay. Every, you know, you know what I mean? You know, it's not just all about colonization. The caste system.

Speaker 4:          00:04:05       Yeah.

Speaker 3:          00:04:05       And it's slaving people of other colors around the world. It's not just about, that's not all we did. Okay. Yay. Hey, you want to focus on the negative? You can do that. Okay. But you can't deny that the beautiful game of football known as soccer rover here in the states as we sit around eating Arby's, right. Was evidently created in England. I don't know when they did it. You'd think for it to have a World Cup by 1934 to sweep the fucking nation. Wait a minute.

Speaker 4:          00:04:47       Yeah.

Speaker 3:          00:04:47       They also had an empire back then. Oh, I get it. So they came up with this game. They'd come in, they'd fucking take you over. They'd fucking kill a bunch of people. And everybody was like, man, these guys are fucking assholes, man. Settle down. Settle down. We're gonna teach you a little game. All right? You can't use your arms. A lot of you had your arms chopped off because you couldn't find any gold anyways. So this is going to work real well for you all. I can use it. Your fate in your fucking had and the game spread like wildfire across the globe

Speaker 3:          00:05:27       as England expanded her empire. I never understood why it was considered female. Was that the tone it down? There was a bunch of Luna tick guys going around the world going and this is a nice place to live. Too Bad. There's other people here. What can we do about this? Everybody does it right? Everybody's done it since the beginning of time. You, you go back, you go back far enough in history books. This is what all guilty white people do. Everybody. Yeah. You know a Africans and slave, the other African jewelry. Would you say that shit, try get past it. You know it's like the Billy Joel Song. We didn't start the fire, which has got to be the most classic, the most classic fucking baby boomer response. I mean, what a fucking baby. He couldn't even take a little bit of responsibility, you know, hey, you know we, we can start here and he starts naming all this shit. Half of it is like pop stars like Marilyn Monroe. What did, what did she have to do with foreign policy? I know she fucked a couple of Kennedy's but I mean other than that, I don't think that dictated whether or not we went into Cuba.

Speaker 3:          00:06:35       Doris Day fucking [inaudible] to Bubba. Papa trouble into sue as the fucky. He must've been on blow what he wrote that song. It's like, Billy, are you going to take any responsibility for the self centered cons that the baby boom generation was? I'm not saying everything you did was bad. I mean, he invented the Frisbee, right? Was that you guys or was that the greatest generation?

Speaker 4:          00:06:59       Yeah.

Speaker 3:          00:07:00       I don't know. Somewhere in there there's gotta be truth right from the greatest generation.

Speaker 4:          00:07:06       Okay.

Speaker 3:          00:07:06       You know, that generation also didn't want to play baseball. Jackie Robinson, by the way, uh, to the baby boomers who are, you know, widely considered the most selfish cons, you know, this country has ever produced, right? Just sitting around staring at the navel, you know, this is the dawning of the age of Aquarius, right? That's the same generation that gave us hippies, but truly Birkenstocks,

Speaker 3:          00:07:39       you know, fucking in the mud at a concert. I used to have a theory way back in the day, you know, when they talked about HIV and aids, they always said that, you know, it was some, somebody, you know, always try something about a monkey or some shit and some guy in France. Got It. Um, I never thought it was then. I used to have a theory that, you know, if you watch the woodstocks tapes and you just see all those naked white people rolling around fucking each other in the mud, I mean, he can't tell me that something didn't come out of that, you know, at least a stronger strain of the mumps. Right. So anyways, to get back to it, you know, I was, I was, uh, working as an actor. I was acting during the last couple of days and I was talking to this dude going like, yeah, how come England keeps saying it's coming home when they were talking about the World Cup? And he goes, is that what they're saying? Those colonizing constantly fucking dude went off. No. It's just like, you know, white people when we're not all bad. I mean, there's some things, you know,

Speaker 3:          00:08:42       Blue Windows curtains, you know, we've done some nice things, you know, now you can look out your house and see all the, the lack of opportunity, right. Right. From inside your house without people. Am I actually taking credit for windows? I Dunno. I have no idea. I don't read. Oh, speaking of which, oh my God. Oh my God. I said on my last podcast that the Obama's bought an $82 million house. Turned out it was an eight point $1 million house. It wasn't even 8.2 million. That's how off I was and this is my favorite thing. So now all these people are like, what? They're all gone. Why don't you do your fucking homework man? Like nothing makes people flip out. Not even religion, unless you make fun of Muslims to those fucking lunatics. A liable to do something, but fucking if you make, if you make fun of like a Democrat or Republican, nothing brings people out of the woodwork. So all these people are like, why don't you do your fucking homework? Blah Blah. Which is hilarious. This whole podcast is based on me not doing any homework, not reading whatsoever. So I'm just going to tell you political concept there. You've got a lot of fucking nerve. A lot. I just said AIDS came for white people fucking in the mud at Woodstock. Are you going to come back at me on that one? What did you do? Your fucking homework, man.

Speaker 5:          00:10:10       Okay.

Speaker 3:          00:10:11       This whole podcast exists for one reason and one reason only. It's to make you feel smarter. Ice. We here at the Monday morning podcast and by we, I mean me in the voices in my head that agree with me. We hear it. The Monday morning podcast set the bar so low that even you, you know with that college that you went to that advertised on television and you drove yourself there and they like living there was not even an option. They didn't have dorms. They just, you know, was your college one giant sad building? Look at like a high school for people in their twenties yeah, yeah. That's who you are. And you know what, even you get to feel smart on this podcast. So my favorite thing is,

Speaker 5:          00:11:00       yeah,

Speaker 3:          00:11:01       if you go back and you listen to my podcasts on Monday when I thought I was so fucking write about the Obamas buying this $82 million house is somebody actually wrote into the podcast and goes, you know bill, I love you, but why don't you do your homework? Obama just signed a $62 million book deal. Okay. And this is what's fucking hilarious. He's telling me to do my homework. He didn't even do the homework to look up to double check what the fuck I said even say if it was true, he just took it for granted that I said $82 million house and then he's like, he took that as truth and started looking up the guy's fucking book deal. So why don't you do your fucking homework man. All right. For the 9 million time. Okay on this podcast.

Speaker 5:          00:11:49       Okay.

Speaker 3:          00:11:49       Do not take anything I say seriously? Okay. You can disagree with the web and you can correct me and all that, but just don't get upset and don't be fucking surprised that I, I fucking don't read. And then my, my facts might be off by a good $72 million. Okay. You know, if you guys sound like all you fucking political cuts out there bitching at me, you sound like all these fucking fat actresses out here who are bitching about Hollywood acting as though they're surprised that so much of this fucking industry is based on how you look. What was that really a shocker? Had He never been to a movie? You didn't notice a trend. Do you think it's just you?

Speaker 5:          00:12:40       Yeah.

Speaker 3:          00:12:40       You know what I mean? You fucking sloppy tits. Who's having a rough time? I'm a fucking bald redhead and male. I have no sympathy for you.

Speaker 5:          00:12:48       Okay?

Speaker 3:          00:12:49       No, he's knocking down their fucking door to put me in an action movie. You know, I could be hell boy. Do a fucking cycle of steroids. I already have the head. You just fucking painted red and you're ready to go. I could do a headstand and fucking my head would turned so red. You could save feeds the amount of money you'd save on makeup and time alone. Bill, do a fucking handstand. Okay, you're in the scene. Um,

Speaker 5:          00:13:18       yeah.

Speaker 3:          00:13:19       Anyways, so I guess the Obamas bought an eight point $1 million house, not an $82 million house, which then led me into this whole thing. Like he's on his, he, this is his third book that he's written. It's like he was writing books while he was president. Aren't you supposed to be running the fucking country?

Speaker 3:          00:13:39       Fucking sitting there dealing with the Russians and all these terrorist groups and all that shit. And then you're like fucking at nighttime, take out a little legal pad. It was the best of times. It was the worst of times. These fucking assholes out right in the books. They always get like somebody else. It's like written by Bill Clinton and the other guy who actually wrote the book. Yeah, I want to run a thriller. Well, how about you and me Ron it right. Like, Oh, you'll put your name and put my name on the cover and then you lock write it.

Speaker 3:          00:14:09       What is that book about? You've got to write what you know. It's gotta be something about somebody fucking sneak around on his wife. Right. Sticking cigars and people. Oh, it's too on the nose. I wanted to be challenged. I wrote about a guy who was faithful. Um, sorry for the bad Bill Clinton. Uh, now you guys spill once you do your whole book. The book is actually bugs experiences, Oxford, Oxford in England, the home where it all started. I take both of those games. I was working both days, so I have to go back and watch them and I gotta tell you, man, I am so fucking sold in that game though. I don't know what happened. I had so much fun making fun of soccer all these fucking years. And it's uh, it's crazy. And then watching the highlights of when a goal is scored, like my whole, my whole complaint about the sport is what makes the sport so great. The fact that scoring is so God damn difficult. The fucking,

Speaker 3:          00:15:11       that the emotion that gets led off when these people score. I mean, Jesus Christ, like in my country, if you dump a beer on somebody's after some sort of point is scored, you're going to get into a fight over there. I mean, it looked like a fucking, I dunno what it looked like. It looked like a, a sports bar combined with the money shot in a porno. Everybody's jumping up and down, just spray and booze all over the place. Part of me that was a little annoying. Like why, why, why are you wasting all that good boots? You know, cause I'm a, I'm, I'm, I'm taking another month off. You don't me.

Speaker 5:          00:15:50       Okay.

Speaker 3:          00:15:51       I impose my own little fucking sabbaticals, you know what I mean? And after that, that my little excursion over there to Europe, oh my God, there's just I aisle that says Rasaka the 1664 bet fucking beer tastes so god damn good in that Goddamn glass in that one cafe, uh, over there in Europe, over there in France. Right then I refuse, I've, I've seen it over here and I've been tempted to buy it and it's like, I'm not going to fucking do it because this is what happens. Like when you go to Ireland and you drink Guinness over there and then you come back here and you want to continue it, it fucking sucks. And you know what else I did? You know, it's just unbelievably like, just on another level is Indian food in England.

Speaker 5:          00:16:38       Yeah.

Speaker 3:          00:16:39       I went to this fucking place. The Indian food was so goddamn good. I've been, I, I've ordered it twice since then. Once in France it was okay. And then I ordered it here in la in it fucking sucked. And it was like, I got to walk away, you know, it's like you go to Paris and he come home and be like, you know, I'm going to have a French breakfast. I'm going to get a, I saw. Right. And then you'd go down to the fucking supermarket and you get an, and it's like somebody pulled it out of this shoe, you know, it just all goes back to the when in Rome thing.

Speaker 5:          00:17:10       Okay.

Speaker 3:          00:17:10       Yes. Go on. Um, you know what I mean? That's the only thing that sucks about traveling.

Speaker 3:          00:17:18       You know what I mean? Like, uh, I'm, I'm, I think I'm going to do a Gig in buffalo coming up. I haven't been there in fucking forever. And what's going to happen is I'm going to go to Duffy's or that other fucking place with, you know, where they came up with buffalo wings and I'm going to eat them and they're going to be so goddamn good. And then I'm going to come back out here. I'm going to have that fucking crack in my, my, my system going, well, I'm going to get, I gotta get some wings out here and when eat them and they're going to suck. And then it's just depressing. Do you like I the only place to get good wings in Buffalo? It really is. I've never gone to any other place other than buffalo that really knows how to make good buffalo wings. That's it. Now I just lob that out there for all of you guys to lose your fucking shoe. Yeah.

Speaker 6:          00:18:02       She, which brought low jockey. Good.

Speaker 5:          00:18:07       Okay.

Speaker 3:          00:18:08       But you want to do is go to Cincinnati. You can go to fucking mfi stay of the best ones. I followed Joe Rogan on all social media and he posted this really fascinating thing that within 10 minutes I was like, I don't even know what the fuck this guy's talking about. He was talking something about fasting and how it's actually could be good for you. I mean, I've read, I mean, Dick Gregory wrote a whole bunch of books on this type of Shit, right? Rest his soul and a saying how, you know, let's see. Oregon's rejuvenate and all of that type of shit. And I thought it was really fascinating. Until about 10 minutes in, I realized I, I didn't understand what the guy was talking about and I looked at him and he was not in the best of shape. He looked a little mushy, you know, which I would think would happen if you fast it, you'd get a little fleshy cause your body would keep eating muscle. You know what I mean? I Dunno. But anyways, um, the fuck was my point. Let's talking about food out cheeses. I don't fucking know. I have no idea. Troubled in this. Sue is

Speaker 6:          00:19:10       JFK blown away.

Speaker 3:          00:19:13       Tips the table over like a fucking baby.

Speaker 5:          00:19:19       MMM.

Speaker 3:          00:19:21       Why am I talking about that? Because I was watching TV late night and I watched all these old 80s

Speaker 5:          00:19:29       videos

Speaker 3:          00:19:32       and that song came on, you know, I'm telling you my new show is 77 sunset strip with FM Zimbalist jr who I was always a big fan of cause that FBI show and uh, and I've been, you know, I've been maintain, you know, I think yesterday was the first day I snapped while driving in a while and it felt weird and I immediately

Speaker 3:          00:19:55       dialed it back down and my move for all you other angry guys out there like me and you're not angry, you're not an angry guy. You just, that's your default emotion. Like, you know what I mean? I'd like to really be an angry guy. You just have to be like walking around seeding, which I don't, I walk around totally normal and then something happens and I fucking flip out, you know, and have a fucking meltdown and then it just takes people. It's just, it's so fucking over the top that everybody forgets what a great guy was for the previous four hours. That's essentially what it is. And it's like a fucking five minute meltdown, you know,

Speaker 3:          00:20:32       it's like, what about the other four hours when I was a good guy? And it's just like no bill. No what you did in that five minutes negated all that. It's like doing four hours of fucking cardio and then sitting down and eating a box of fucking Oreo cookies. It's just, it, you just negated all of that. It's over. You still a fat fuck emotionally. So anyways, I, I listened to baseball, I listened to the red sox on Sirius Xm and uh, actually watched, then I came home that's making me watch them again. Fucking Chris sales up God damn beast. You watched the game last night when he walked that guy and he didn't think that he walked him and he got fucking mad cause he started throwing like 98, 99 miles an hour on the corners. That crazy delivery. Um,

Speaker 3:          00:21:18       I dunno, we shall see that. I don't know who that bum was that they brought in the fucking eighth inning. Then almost gate, we were up four to nothing and he's like, you know what? Let's make the gamblers nervous is an nice fatty hanging out over the plate. Bam. Base head, boom. Double four to one, load them up and they finally got him out of there. Then our relief pitcher, I don't know anybody's name, that guy who comes out there, he hangs his arm like he's driving a shirt or some shit. He came out there and shut them the fuck down. Um, so I'm, I'm like a, I'm back into that shit and I'm actually going to be really sad when the World Cup's over. When is the finals out on Saturday? That's going to be crazy one match for all the fucking models. Can you imagine if that comes down to penalty kicks again?

Speaker 3:          00:22:09       I used to think that was the stupidest fucking thing ever. Like a world basketball, basketball championship coming down to foul shots. You know what I mean? That would just be like boring as shit. But now I get it. I get it. Because if you fuck it up, I really feel like the goaltender has like no pressure cause all he has to do is just guess, you know, I love that they're guessing it's just a total guests. And when they guess, right, they guess, right. They stand up like, yeah, like, like there was some sort of intelligent thought there. It's just like left, right, left, right diving left. Fuck you went right. Um, that always, it's always funny when they guess wrong when they're, they start to dive that way and they realized that guy went the other way and you just watched the goaltender, like his whole body goes limp.

Speaker 3:          00:22:56       Like, ah, I should tell the other way and he just fucking lands on the grass. Um, but the pressure on the shooter, they don't want to miss the net. So I, I, I'm gathering it takes massive balls to try to shoot it up top to go top corner, which why wouldn't you just go there? He's not going to fucking get that. Cause it's like, what if I miss then I'm that cunt that fucking missed for the rest of my fucking life in fat, crooked, great teeth, fish and chip eating. Fucking assholes can get my grill everywhere I go for the rest of my life. People who never accomplish it now can take out the failure of their life on me cause I tried to go top shelf. What do you guys call it? What do we do? What do you guys call shelfs over them?

Speaker 3:          00:23:44       The Bonnet. The boot. What the fuck do you always have some stupid fucking name for it? Um, I've noticed that I'm cooking shows. Every ingredient you guys pronounce differently. Oregano, Oregon. No tomato, tomato. Bazell Basel Second. They just fucking with me. There wasn't one thing. Do we hate England that much? By the end of it, I really think that we would like to summer school kids that came over here in like the weird religious people. Yeah. We all came over here and you had people who weren't good in school. Fucking people that were too into religion and those two people combined made Americans.

Speaker 3:          00:24:27       That's why I am the product of that. And I thought an eight point $1 million house was $82 million. Why don't you do your homework, but you go fuck yourself. Do my homework. I'm not in fucking school. All right. I didn't get in this business to think. All right, let me, uh, let me read it. A little bit of advertising here. JFK blown away. A tipping over your fucking table. I still love Billy Joel cause he got so hammered, he drove his car through his fucking neighbor's living room window. I mean, can you, can you loan him enough sugar in your lifetime to get past that? You know, every day I'd be knocking on the door. Hey Man, if you want to borrow a rake or a wheel barrow, anything, anything, you know Barrow by the way, not barrel roll out the Barrow where Ray can some fuck and leaves a, by the way, Dean del Ray from the letter B talk podcast on all things.

Speaker 3:          00:25:31       Comedy has the legendary Henry Rollins on his podcast this week. This is a dream guests for Dean del race. He want to listen to them. Fan Boy out while asking all the questions. You always wanted to hear Henry Rollins answer. Give a take a few, um, checking out in the all things coming network. Let there be talk.

Speaker 11:         00:53:36       you guys see that car. I just saw a commercial for Kentucky Fried Chicken where the parents are all excited because the two bratty kids won't sit still at the dinner table, but they got them this fucking chicken and they're feeding it to the, basically very subtly saying that there's drugs in this chicken that will make you a spastic children. Chill the fuck out and spastic. I mean like, you know, not, not the way they mean it over there in Great Britain, you can't say that on the comedy. So you can say it in a comedy club over in Scotland, but you'll have a rough, you'll have a rough go of it if you say the kid was spastic over there, that means like severely mentally challenged over here. It just means you're not going to get laid to you at 26

Speaker 8:          00:54:23       when

Speaker 11:         00:54:23       you were in Grad school looking over a fucking cadaver, right, with some other fucking nerve narrowed. Right. And you're just sitting there going, you know the ankle bones connected to the knee bone. Right. Has any of this made any sense? What shouldn't? It's fucking Sunday night and I am spent and I got a whole bunch of Shit I have to do tomorrow so I got to do it tonight. All right, I'm off my game. All right, you, you cleanse your liver and like 42 43 days or something like that. Every drunk guy knows has told me that if he drunk, I know that does not have a medical degree. Has told me that if you go 42 43 days you will cleanse your liver at least to the booze. You know now if you fucking, you start doing blow or a, you know, eating a bunch of trans fat fucking food or feeding your kids Kentucky Fried fucking chicken, Jesus Christ.

Speaker 11:         00:55:15       What happened to parents that you got a drug, your kids to keep them under control, you know, you know what it is. Kids don't respect their parents, they respect him, but they don't respect like, oh my God, this, this person could wring my neck, could pick me up by my hair. Right. Could grab a paddle and fucking, you know, mostly hit my ass, but also kinda hit my lower back because I'm squirming right. That doesn't exist anymore. So now these kids are so fucking out of control. These people have to go down to Kentucky Fried Chicken. Okay. And I, I, I use the term chicken very loosely to go down and whatever that is, that's in that bucket. Okay. If it doesn't have a beak, it doesn't have feet. If it's fucking, you know, justice, it's breasts is sticking out like the cast on fucking, uh, what was, what was that show with the Italians there on New Jersey shore. Jersey shore. Right. My world. That's not a fucking chicken. You know, you want the chicken that looked like Mark McGuire in his rookie season. You don't want to eat the chicken. That looks like mark McGwire when he fucking played for the cardinals, you know,

Speaker 11:         00:56:37       do you eat a regular fucking chicken? First of all, it's going to look like a pigeon to you because you so used to seeing those roided up once that they have murderer's row that you got down there at your fucking Shaws, right? You Vons, you, JC Penney's, wherever the fuck you buy your goddamn chicken, you go down, you go down to any one of the main stream fucking supermarkets. Okay. And I swear to God, when you get to the chicken section, okay, if you, if you slept for the last 30 years, like that Van Gundy guy under the bridge or whatever his fucking name is, Van Morrison, the hell's his name, Rip Van Winkle. Right. It was one of those people, one of the vans. Um, if you slept for the last 30 years and you went down, okay. And they showed you what a chicken was, you'd be like, ah. You'd be like, that ain't no chicken. Okay. It's a goddamn Turkey. I know. Fucking yeah, die. No fucking Turkey. When I say what I no such thing as a mad pad. Fucking chicken can't be done. No Sir. No Sir. Get off my property. Okay. I'm, I'm done with your witchcraft. Okay. Hey, I said get the fuck Outta here. The fuck off my property.

Speaker 5:          00:57:53       MMM

Speaker 11:         00:57:56       honey, get the gun. Um, yeah, you would think it was a fucking Turkey. And the thing is, is now it's a chicken. And I remember I watched one of those food inks, one of those fucking liberal goddamn things, you know, talking about flying carpets in electric roads and all that bullshit. Somewhere in there they were talking about, you know, the food supply and I'll poison it is poisonous poisoning than it is. It is. Um, so I fucking went down to a farmer's fucking mom and um, I said, I wanna, I wanna, I wanna all I want, I want, I want an all natural fucking chicken. I can't even talk. I'm so tired. One an all natural chicken. The guy goes, these are all natural. And I said, all natural. And he goes, well, I'm like, come on, where is it? And he had to walk around the corner sitting over there, lonely.

Speaker 11:         00:58:52       I swear to God, looking like a dove look going in. Somebody killed the fucking, he goes right there. That one right there is 100% all natural. Nothing's wrong with it. And I was like, I was like, what? That's what a chicken is supposed to look like. And he raised his eyebrows and he, he kind of put his lips together so they were a straight line. And then he nodded, you know, that looked at people do like, like, yeah, I'm in the Matrix. I realize I'm in the Matrix. You know, I knocked the bitch up so I got to be selling these roided up chickens. No. Um, anyways, anyway, what the fuck I'm talking about? So basically that's what these people are eating over there. Okay. There they are drugging up their kids, but I can't get mad at him because I actually did that to Charlie Murphy and Darnell Rawlings.

Speaker 11:         00:59:47       I've told this story before, Hey, I'll tell it against my fucking podcast. I actually drug I the exact thing that they're doing in their Kentucky Fried Chicken commercial where they're trying to get their kids to sit still by just feeding them so full of these fucking trans fats from these roided up beatless fucking chickens with their Dolly Parton breasts. Disses right. I did that to fucking Darnell and Charlie. I was hung over and we taken a car service from Chicago xannies up to one of those whenever the fuck it was Saint Charles was a three city run and one of them was Saint Charles. So we're getting in the fucking Limo, Don L's in rare form. Charlie's in rare form their fucking Gavin and trash and people and me and everybody and I just don't want to hear it. I'm like, I don't want to listen to these fucking guys running that Goddamn yaps in the back of this car the whole fucking way up.

Speaker 11:         01:00:46       I want a nice quiet ride. This is going to suck. And I walked outside, hung over and I walked into this Chicago where you know, almost got hit by three fat people. And, um, I looked up the street and I saw it, I saw Popeye's and I was like, oh, thank God. And I fucking walked in there and I got all this fucking Popeye's chicken with biscuits and all of this shit food. And I brought it back to the car. And as the car pulled up, they came out and I say, guys, I got to sell some. I got some food. And they were like, oh, that's fucking great. You know, they were hungry or whatever. And they started showering that fucking Popeye's food. And I sat back, nibbling on drumstick, and I swear to God, 10 minutes later they were asleep. I'm not lying.

Speaker 11:         01:01:41       They were fucking asleep, snoring the whole way up. And I was just sitting there, loving life, the whole fucking write up. And I, you know what, I admitted to him later, they thought it was funny, but that's basically what it is. They call it the Itis, that's what they call it. When you eat that shit food and then you have to go to sleep, they call it the Itis, I guess. And by they, I mean African Americans. Um, they call it the fucking Itus and that's what the gut, and I learned that from don because I don't know how that man stayed in shape, but he had the worst diet. He's one of those guys who like you stopped for gas and he comes out of the gas station with like one of those gas station hotdogs

Speaker 11:         01:02:27       and he would eat it and then he would immediately fall asleep. And I got, I would say to Charlie, look at this guy were, he's sleeping. And Chad be like, yeah man, he got the itis. Let me explain that to me and what that little bit of information, it went into my evil white brain and I drug my two African American friends way back in the year 2005. Um, and that's a little chicken story for you. What time did you like dad? Everybody. So that's what the fuck they're saying right there. That's what Kentucky Fried Chicken is allegedly saying. I guess they have to say a legit, so that lawyers on retainer don't attack my fucking podcast as far as I can tell. I'm asking you right now, uh, Kentucky Fried Chicken hiding behind your fucking letters, KFC. Is that what the fuck you do? Is that what you're saying?

Speaker 8:          01:03:20       Yeah.

Speaker 11:         01:03:21       If you've got kids who are not stimulated enough that they can't even sit down, if you haven't read yet to have run them around, you got to tie your kids out. Open the door. You send them out in the fucking yard. Go ahead. Go outside, get outside and play. That's what you do. Like a Goddamn one of those fucking Irish dogs. It was bred to have to to herd sheep. You've got to let that fucking thing run around. Run around in circles. Guy, get out there, take a ball, and you just fucking throw it out in traffic. Let the dog run around. Dodgy cars that comes in, it's going to lay down. Okay? It's not going to jump all over. Company sticking it's cold nose right in their fucking who has. That's what you gotta do with your kids. You've got to send them outside, right? But to catch a Predator and all these other fucking shows, you know, all these shows on TV where people forget they're kids are in a car with the windows rolled up. Their kids are too fucking dumb to roll them down or they're too weak because they haven't gone outside and climb to fucking tree and they stay in there and their, their brains get cooked like a boxer, you know?

Speaker 8:          01:04:24       Okay.

Speaker 11:         01:04:25       Do you know that dog boxes? They know they don't do well in this sun. Well we'll need to do fat kids. If you leave the windows rolled up, you know, and they got those weak arms at all. That doesn't like the most tedious things they ever did was take a wrapper off of a fucking, uh, an ice cream sandwich. Right? You can't leave them in the car. My mother left us in the car all the fucking time. She would go to school. She was going to school during the day trying to further her education as she left five fucking kids in the car with the windows rolled up and money for Burger King. And she would say to us, just go into the Burger. That's the only time you were to leave this car over the left, over the next three fucking hours when I'm in class.

Speaker 11:         01:05:08       And she would disappear around the corner after we set. Absolutely mom. And she walked away. And uh, we immediately would get out of the car, start up and down the streets in Boston. We go into fucking burger king and we, we'd have something to eat. Do you know what, what happened? Nowadays they just saw five fucking dirty face kids walking up and down, calm AV Boylston street going into a burger king, look like the cast to fucking nanny. Someone would've filmed it and my mother would have been in, Jay would have taken us away, you know, but, but they didn't cause there was no cameras back then or videotape ones. I mean there was, but only the people add them on like the news and a young Steven Spielberg. So we went in there and we fucking got some food, Kline bunk cars and fucking yelled at people and Shit, you know, hanging on plant parking meters and all that.

Speaker 11:         01:06:02       Hence, we had the fucking forearm strength to roll down the windows and none of us ever had an issue in the car. And you know what? I think that's one to grow on today. You go people, I'm not saying KFC is food, I'm not, I'm just kidding. I'm not saying it's bad food. Every once in awhile, who's kitten home? Every once in we don't go would be great if he could just fucking do heroin the way you can eat McDonald's. Just like every once in awhile he'd just be like, you know what? Yeah, let's just fucking tie off. Not off for the rest of the fucking day. And like the people that work understood it, you know? Hey, where were you yesterday? Od and yeah, I got this black tar heroin came in. You know, I hadn't done it like three months away. Figured fuck it. Oh, is that what you did? How was it? I wasn't, you know, like, like you went to Aruba, you said October was all ice.

Speaker 14:         01:06:52       I don't remember shit she can do, you know, you get addicted to [inaudible]. That's fine.

Speaker 11:         01:08:08       Hey, what's going on? It's bill Belper and it is the Monday morning podcast for Monday, July 12th, 2010

Speaker 1:          01:08:16       all la. I'm sorry, I was really gonna act like I could speak Spanish there all although you'll soy comical, anemia, maybe litchi or numb on Santa Bent. The loan A's Una COMESA. I actually, if you can't tell, I've actually finally broken open my Rosetta stone that I got for Christmas two and a half fucking years ago. Whatever it is. Yeah, I got it for a year and a half ago. December of 2008 I got a the Rosetta stone. Um, oh God. Yeah. Black or Negro. Roho um, I, I got it, dude. It's the shit. It's a shit. I'm going to be fluent in Spanish. I've always wanted to learn another language and I am trying to immerse myself. That's what I'm trying to do. I'm trying to immerse myself in the language. I'm listening to it on the radio. I'm also listening to it. Uh, you know, I'm listening to shit like this on a, on my iTunes, hoping I can pick up some shit. You know, you gotta, you gotta immerse yourself in this shit. You got to listen to stuff like this.

Speaker 1:          01:09:44       A fucking great. Is that got to have a fucking be able to fucking no. What that means. Sing that have pigment in my chest so I can actually wear that open. I'm going to go stab a ball. Latino shirt. How much pussy would you get if he could fucking, it's just unbelievable. It's half the shit that they say. It sounds like fucking dirty talk when you're banging a girl in need yet. Pipit itchy. That means a girl who's drinking them is drinking milk. There's no way to say that without, just sounded like you're fucking, yeah, Nina. Vivid, itchy. Hey, next time you guys are banging your girl. Okay. You got a Doggie style. Just lean down in her ear and just feel like, ah, it itchy, needy of vivid, itchy.

Speaker 1:          01:10:35       Shall we even have an orgasm or fucking world around and elbow when you, you in the face either way. Either way. It's going to be funny, but I want to be fluent in that Shit and uh, I'm liking Rosetta stone. I really like it. You sit there and you put on like a, a bill, Bellamy, Janet Jackson sort of headset, you know, and uh, yeah, you put it on some stretchy pants and then you put, you put in the fucking CD Rom or whatever the hell it is. And then they just, they just start speaking to you like you're a baby sitting in the crib. That's exactly what it is. Two very stereotypical Mexican look and faces just sort of peer into the screen, like you're laying in the crib and then they just start speaking to you and they tickle your tummy. It's, it's tremendous.

Speaker 1:          01:11:23       It's a tremendous, it's a tremendous way to nom. I'm just fucking around, dude. It's awesome. It's a, if you ever thinking about doing it, like, you know, I always wanted to learn to speak a different language. Whenever I rode the subway, I was nervous that Puerto Rican through actually calling me bad words. What does [inaudible] mean? Um, is that even Puerto Rican? This is what's killing me. This is how fucking what I am. I actually believe that I'm going to learn this shit. Uh, El Nina Bibliology, I'm going to learn this shit and uh, therefore I will be able to go to Mexico, Cuba, Puerto Rico, Brazil or whatever, and be able to understand every motherfucker out there, even though people I know this dude who is Cuban and he tells me it's, it's really different. Not totally different, but, um, I mean, I don't know. He seemed a little peeved when I was like, yeah, and I can go to fucking Cuba. I can go to Dominican Republic. It's not the fucking same thing. All right, sorry. You know when it's one of those things, I'm not even trying to be offensive and I offended you, but it's like, you know, do you think when I go to Ireland or I went, I went to Scotland. I can understand those fuckers, everything that they said, but I knew what they was saying.

Speaker 1:          01:12:38       Am I being ignorant right here? Do you guys, is it a complete, it's not a completely different language. Ah, they'll, Nina Bibby lit. You can't say that and fucking Cuba and they won't know what you're talking about. Is that because economy, communism, you know, I already stopped this podcast and started it again because I'm doing this Sunday morning. My fucking brain isn't awake yet. Stuttering like a goddamn jackass. Ah. Pantaloneys Sabbat doors will not come Isa. I can't fucking wait. I can't wait the first time somebody from uh, I was going to say somebody from another language. That's how dumb I am. Somebody speaking Spanish talk shit about me because I'll tell you right now, I would fucking do it all the time. I would do it all the Goddamn time. If English was the second language was not the main language of this country. And I had another English speaking friends in and I was walking around people who did not understand English and it'll be our own little private language.

Speaker 1:          01:13:43       I would be shitting on people, right and left perverted stuff. Can you imagine that? If nobody understood English, everybody just spoke Spanish, right? Your bosses, some can't, but she's got a nice rack and you sit in there and she could literally walk by and like, dude, I would tit, fuck this bitch right on a Goddamn desk. And then turn around me. Oh La me boss. Ah, you know, no wonder they're so fucking laid back. They can get it out. I gotta sit. I got to sit on all this goddamn rage because I don't have some secret fucking language. All right. All right. Mexicans. I mean you fucking hide out and I'm breaking down your code. So I'm telling you this time next year, you better watch your tongue. Okay, good.

Speaker 1:          01:14:30       All the I could turn learning another language seat, see it and see here me stuttering. It's in the morning only I could turn speaking another language and my only, I could turn a the language, relax Mexico, just relax. Just really listen to a couple of my podcasts and realize how fucking stupid I am. And also how I get totally psycho into something for about 10 days. And then I just walk away from it and then it just sits there gathering dust on my desk. Anyways, so it was a big week this weekend in sports. It's actually, uh, what time is it right now? It's 10 43 and this is the funny thing. In 17 minutes, the World Cup final is starting, which is basically the championship, one of the true championships of the world. It's the entire world competes for it. And as big a fucking sports fan as I am, I could give a shit.

Speaker 1:          01:15:32       The only thing that I would find less interesting than the World Cup final was the Lebron James Hour long press conference to announce what team he's going to fucking go to. You know, that's actually bullshit. I totally respect the game of soccer. It just, it fucking bores the shit out of me. And A, we have a number of soccer fans on here and they send me emails and they get mad at me. They say, says, Dear Bill Dude, until you have a better understanding of the game, you gotta stop ragging on soccer. Find someone that knows a little bit about the game and take some fucking time and watch a couple of games. Dude, watch the World Cup finals. Uh, exclamation point. What? Cause you fucking say so. Um, do you realize that if you added up everyone that watched the NFL, the NBA, the Nhl, and MLB, you would only have about half as many people that watch soccer do.

Speaker 1:          01:16:26       Do you realize that? I'm not so fucking stupid that I don't realize that you just pulled that stat out of your ass. Give me some numbers you didn't. You said you would have about PAF is about really? Yeah. You're going to guesstimate there. Put that in your pipe and smoke it bill. Thanks dude. All right. This is the deal. All right. I'm so sick of these fucking soccer cunts trying to convince me that it's an exciting sport. Do you think that I haven't sat down and watched it earlier this year when I watched the Olympics, I got into curling. I was watching the cross country skiing. Will you shoot the gun? I'm very open minded when it comes to sports. Okay. But to sit there and killed two, three fucking hours of my day to watch a zero to zero fucking game and watching these guys flop around like a bunch of Goddamn POW goes Saul's every 10 fucking minutes.

Speaker 1:          01:17:21       It's, it's, I try, dude. I tried it just because the whole fucking world is watching the sport. Does it mean that I should? All right. The whole world was wearing an acid wash jeans and the lay fucking eighties I followed that trend and I got the embarrassing God damn pictures to prove it. Where the fuck did that get me? You know what I like about soccer? I like the highlights, the highlights, you know, and they show it in slow motion motion. Absolutely gorgeous sport to watch, but to sit there for fucking two hours listening to those God damn mosquito horns, you're really asking too much.

Speaker 1:          01:17:59       All right, everybody flopping around like a bunch of God damn fucking girls. Get off the goddamn ground. Fucking pussies. The guy doesn't even touch you and you flop around on the ground. It's so a feminine. That's what I can't stand about that sport. You know this guy did bring up a good point. He goes, you're telling me the basketball players. Yes. Basketball players do. Basketball is a very fucking a feminine sport when it comes to that shit. That fake fucking flopping around. Yeah, no other, you know, that's the closest thing. I'm trying to think. There's a couple guys in the NHL, look, there's always going to be a couple of broads in every sport, you know, but at least in, in, in the NHL soccer fan, you know what they have, they have a penalty for pretending that somebody hit you two minutes. You get, it's called diving. Two minutes for diving, get up you fag and getting the Goddamn penalty box.

Speaker 1:          01:18:55       I was, I dunno, I, I, dude, I tried. I fucking tried. I tried to watch the shit. I don't give a fuck. Um, I find the Premiere League way more enjoyable to watch. I can watch that game, but I got to tell you like, I don't know what it is. I start to get a headache and I get a little bit of a stomach ache when I'm watching it because the amount of effort that I have to put in to, you know, do, to sit there and in two hours of your fucking life to watch a one to nothing game. That's why, you know, so I think I finally figured out why they fight in Nhl hockey cause you can actually have a one to nothing fucking game. So, you know, then we basically have guys going, it's legal to smash somebody's, you know, against the boards. You can drop the gloves, he could fight. There's a lot of other exciting things that, that, that do happen. All right? But to sit there for two fucking hours.

Speaker 1:          01:19:52       Oh my God. Oh my God. Oh my God. Ah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. Ooh, ah, it's the sports equivalent to fucking blue balls. I don't fucking like it. I really don't. I just don't. I don't like it. I don't fucking like it. Okay. And you can't make me fucking like it because the whole world likes it. All right. Is this is a major part of the fucking world that, you know, they, they take out a high grade piece of sandpaper and then they, they, they rubbed the girl's fucking clips off. That doesn't mean that I think it's right. Wow. That was really disgusting. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. 12 minutes into the podcast, getting that fucking gross. I should have saved that towards the end for the die hard fans. Um, so anyways, that, that Lebron James Announcement, um, speaking of mind numbingly boring. Um, I listen to think about fucking soccer.

Speaker 1:          01:20:49       Like I'm invited to this, this, this party where they're going to watch the finals and whenever you find a person who's really into soccer, you know, yeah, they always get like the little soccer shirt on. They always have like these little fucking wimpy torsos. If you notice, that was the last time you saw somebody jacked that was into fucking soccer. You don't always have like those little fucking, those little European torsos, you know, your little seventh grade bodies. It does anybody lift weights or do pushups or anything in fucking Europe? Do you just, you just take the torso God gave you and then you just start stuffing fish and chips down your fucking throat and you just let it all sort of slide down until you look like Jethro Tull. Um, all right. I think I've tried that shit enough. Let's trash in American sports. Let's talk about fucking Lebron James and his fucking, first of all, his howdy doody puppets shirt that he wore. You know, there really is this theory out there that black guys are so cool that they really can wear any type of clothing and make it look good. Well, that was an example when it doesn't quite always work. I mean, that was a, I don't know what that was. That looked like he was going to go sing on the Grand Ole Opry in like 1948.

Speaker 1:          01:22:09       Um, all right, the fuck am I talking about? Let's get into this whole podcast thing. Alright. Uh, the Lebron James one hour announcement for everybody out there who's saying how fucking lame it was. Um, you know who's fault that is? It's your own God damn fault. It's your own fucking fault for sitting there and watching it. Okay? It's not like ESPN lied. They told you what it was going to be. [inaudible] this is going to be a one hour special of an athlete announcing which team he's going to go fucking play for. I mean, how long should that realistically take? It's like the fucking Oscars. How long should it take to be and to, to take to just fucking be like in the Oscar goes to Sean Connery and the Oscar for the best fucking dress in a period piece goes to Claire, Bill Billingsley, Bill Billingsley clear bill Billingsley fucking Douche bag.

Speaker 1:          01:23:07       Go Burn. Not even fucking awake. Trying to do a podcast to get it out of the Goddamn way to go to some stupid ass fucking party that's showing the finals of a sport that he doesn't give a fuck about. That starts in nine minutes. Oh my God. Somebody hit fucking record. Um, yeah. I mean, you knew what the fuck it was going to be. Why did you even watch it? I mean, can't you tell that that day, that guy just got some fucking horrific and he just got horrific advice from his people around him who they were just like, we're going to create the biggest media stir ever. All right, we'll go to Chicago first. We'll gain some interests. We'll go to the Knicks, we'll get some interested. We'll go down and fucking man, oh, where the fuck is he going to? Who gives a shit?

Speaker 1:          01:23:53       Nobody cares except the people in those fucking towns. I gotta tell you, I really did enjoy him. Fucking, you know, tear in the hearts on in Knicks fans because as always, New York fans are the most fucking, just like a, that's the sense of entitlement that fans of New York sports have just because they live in New York City. If I have to watch one more fucking asshole on TV, talk about the big stage in New York. Okay. Overrated. Underrated for this week. Overrated. The big stage in New York, there's only one big stage in New York. It's in fucking Yankee stadium. That's the only big stage that is in New York. 27 championships. You go there, there is pressure to win. What is this big like when Lebron didn't pick fucking in New York? I'm on, you know, I'm online and I read three comments and I'm like, there you go. That's enough evidence for me.

Speaker 1:          01:24:53       I'm going to judge every new fan in New York right now. They were all sitting there going like, oh, he was afraid of the bright lights. He couldn't handle the big stage of New York. Let me ask you this, Nick fans, where is the big fucking stage for professional basketball in New York City? Huh? Madison Square Garden, that place, the biggest thing that happens in Madison Square Garden every year is Elton John comes there and sell. He fucking sells out 20 shows. You know Bruce Springsteen comes there and sings his songs about New Jersey. The circus comes once a fucking year. Those are the biggest days every year. And Madison Square Garden. All right, and in case you don't know what I'm talking about, next time you go there and there's yet another horrific played by May, by either the fucking rangers or the Knicks, and you look up and discussed to that, to the sports gods, like what the fuck?

Speaker 1:          01:25:55       When you're done praying for some messiah to come in there and save those two pathetic fucking franchises, look up at the ceiling and tell me what you see. A striking lack of championship fucking banners. I'll even give you the goddamn answers you dumped. Fucks. There is no big stage and it's so fucking disrespectful. I've everybody to say that all the fucking time. Talking about Amy, you know when they talk about the biggest stage in, in major, Major League baseball team, what do they say? Fenway Park. How about Saint Louis? Say they got, they got 10 fucking world series titles.

Speaker 1:          01:26:39       That's not even a good example. It's not like the Knicks are in second place with titles. Dude, Yankee stadium is the big stage and made major league baseball. Okay? The fucking Celtics have 17 NBA championships that we're all one in Boston. All right. The Los Angeles Lakers, 11 titles have been one there. They once a year they hold hands with somebody from Minnesota and they add the five that we're in. That's, that's the thing right there. The Minneapolis Lakers have more titles than the fucking New York next. Do you guys understand that? That a team that's dead, that fucking moved west. All right. That moved fucking West around the same time the Brooklyn Dodgers went out to la still has three more fucking titles than you do. You don't have a big stage there and nobody is afraid to play in New York City and there's certainly not afraid to play the fucking Knicks.

Speaker 1:          01:27:37       So get off your own dicks. I'm sick of it. All right. The jets haven't won it since 69 the Knicks haven't wanted since 73 the mets haven't won it since fucking 86 who else has left? The giants are, are a respectable franchise. That's the best you have. You have a respectable franchise that is one. The same amount of Superbowls is the patriots, the packers, the Redskins, and the Raiders. The giants are in the middle of the pack. All right? There's no big fucking stage. And they sit there and they act like these sports writers in New York. These fat man tinted jackasses, these fill mush nics are going intimidate a guy at the level of fucking Lebron James. They're not. I hate to tell it to you in New York. The reason why he didn't go to Madison Square Garden is cause she has suck. That's why, I mean think about that. Who the fuck wouldn't want to go play in New York? You know, New York is the city is the Paris of fucking of America. It's the best fucking city we have. All right. But just because there's a bunch of people outside of Madison Square Garden succeeding and doing some shit, most of whom aren't even from New York by the way.

Speaker 1:          01:28:57       That's another thing. New Yorkers think they're the shit just because they live there just

Speaker 15:         01:29:02       because they're standing on the corner of fucking 52nd and third eaten a slice.

Speaker 1:          01:29:07       You know, if I can mark it there, I'll make an anywhere.

Speaker 15:         01:29:11       Are you really making it with your dirty fucking sneakers standing there outside of Tad steaks? You're not doing shit. None of you are all you fucking pieces of Shit fucking gathering outside of fucking port authority.

Speaker 1:          01:29:25       Yeah. That's another thing of, Oh man, I'm trashing the York this week. I don't give a fuck. Listen to me. I don't give a fuck who bill. Really? You're being dangerous. It's dangerous to make the alarm Bray and a data resol. Um, do Frank Sinatra's from New Jersey. Okay. He was bridge and tunnel. Okay. The kind of the kind of guy that Paris Hilton wouldn't have fucked in one of her whore night clubs down there in the meatpacking district. If he came in and said, oh, I live in Hoboken, she would have turned a little pointy nose up to the ceiling and walked away, or in a big fucking Sasquatch feet that she tries to hide. Bye Jack. And a god Goddamn fucking ass in the air to eye level. No girls would have banged that guy. But what did he do? He came in there, he came in there and he fucking sang a song and he took over your fucking city, the way a bunch of people from other states that you fucking New Yorkers looked down on.

Speaker 1:          01:30:26       We come in there all the time. We come in there and we blow away half the fucking talent in New York because you guys are standing there eating a slice of pizza, looking at the fucking empire state building going, oh, it's open all night. You're not doing shit. You don't have a big stage. You have a sorry ass fucking NBA team. You know this. How dumb the fucking nics are. Isaiah Thomas, there was a league called the CBA that did find for like 30 fucking years and then s what's his face? Isaiah Thomas. Thomas became president of the league and in like three, four years, I don't have the fucking stats. I don't know, five years. It went out of business. Okay. I'm not talking about, you know, a winning franchise went to a losing franchise. I'm not talking about a franchise that existed in a city, had to move.

Speaker 1:          01:31:23       I'm not even saying the franchise folded. I'm talking about an entire fucking league. He got it to controls. He pushed the yolk forward and just flew the shit right into the goddamn ground. All right? And like bugs bunny. He stepped out right before it hit the ground before any of it got on him and then the next go. Yet that's our guy. That's the guy we're going to get to run the f a fucking NBA franchise. The guy who fucking flew bootleg NBA into the goddamn ground. That's the fucking dude. See, that's why Lebron didn't come. Not because he's afraid of the big stage. You want to know who is afraid of the big stage? Jeff Weaver. Jeff Weaver was afraid of the big stage. Okay? But Lebron James is not afraid of the big, the big stage. Okay? He could fucking put his nuts on Jeff waivers chest and hold them down in the deep end of a fucking pool. All right? He's not afraid of fucking Madison Square Garden

Speaker 15:         01:32:26       and I also thought it was really fucking ironic

Speaker 1:          01:32:29       of the three emails that I read by New Yorkers, which I'm now judging all of them, they were going like, you know Miami. That's Dwayne Wade's town. If he goes down there and wins a championship there, nobody's going to respect him.

Speaker 15:         01:32:42       Can you fucking believe a New Yorker had the balls to say that with the fucking pile on team that the Yankees have been for the last 12 fucking years? Every goddamn free agent on the fucking planet just clinging to Derek Jeters leg. Show me how to do it. I want to win one too. Huh? Roger Clemens, that fat buffalo wing, Eaton Jackass. Was it hard up in Toronto? Roger. Then he fucking comes down there and jumps in the fucking Limo. The fucking balls are these New York fans to sit there and question somebody's piling on another team to go in a fucking championship. I, I can't even take it.

Speaker 15:         01:33:26       I think I've got to drink some throat coat tea that I mentioned that on this podcast cause I already deleted the other one when I was annoyed with how fucking unfunny I was. Um, ground when I go out on a limb here and say that the ratings for this in New York City are going to be kind of low this week I've got this throat coat tea, which is a great, if you stand on stage and you don't know how to write a joke, you have to scream at jokes or even feel like to call your girlfriend and comment at the top of your lungs. You know, you have to do that. And then the next day you want to do it again. But you throw his two tore up. You can't do it. Well get organic throat coat tea. Everybody. You could call your girl account seven days a week. Three and 65 days a year. That'd be a great commercial, right? Just have the girl crying in the background. Sitting down in the fetal position is you're fucking sitting in the field. Fetal position bill curled up in the fetal position bill. He had dumb fuck. All right, let's see. What did I do so far in this podcast? I pissed off anyone who isn't from America

Speaker 1:          01:34:26       or I guess you know

Speaker 15:         01:34:28       Americans who are also into soccer and then I trashed a a giant media market. See right there bill. That's why New York is such the big stage because it's worded

Speaker 1:          01:34:39       the biggest media markets in all of the fucking cook for you.

Speaker 15:         01:34:43       How pathetic are you fucking teams that you've got to bring up the level of media in your city, the level of media gimme a fucking break.

Speaker 1:          01:34:57       Two Championship banners, 1970 fucking three do you know in 1973 the Chevy Vega was considered a sports car. And if you go on the game show network, people lose their fucking minds about that car, you know, and you can win. And then they opened the current Brad Little Chevy Vega and these people with their fucking big Greg Greg Bait, Brady fucking belt buckles, and they're fucking, ah, who's that dude from? Knocked up, observe and report their, there's Seth Rogan fucking Afros go absolutely fucking ape shit over a Chevy Vega. That's when you guys won it last. People from are dying of old fucking age on that team. Who Do you have an attorney? Who are the fucking, the Nix, the greats.

Speaker 1:          01:35:58       Who Do you got? Bill Bradley Dodd. He became a senator and then he fucking died. This is what it is. You want to get down to brass tacks here? What's really bugging me is, uh, in Boston we only have four sports teams. Okay. We're playing a fucking, you know, we got one, one bullet in the chamber and those cuts down there in New York, they're doubled down in two out of the four fucking sports every year. This split and fucking aces in two different sports. So they pad their stats with championships. But I respect the Yankees. The Yankees are the greatest franchise in an an all for sports. They got the fucking championships. You have to respect it. They got them. And I would never ever try to act like somebody was afraid to play in Boston because of the media or whatever the fuck that you know or call it the big stage in Boston.

Speaker 1:          01:37:01       All right. I would never do that out of respect for the fucking Yankees. The fact that they have 20 more fucking championships than we do. Okay, so give me the fucking respect that I deserve as a Boston Celtics Fan, that we have 15 more fucking NBA championships than you do fucking idiots. The big state. I'm so sick of these fat mantated shitheads with their fucking game worn jerseys and they yell shit at players on the field and they think that they're intimidating them. You know like the fact that you got a d up Kobe Bryant that you know that night isn't enough to make you nervous? No, it's the fat fuck with the shaved head and fucking row 58 g who Stew's Chanten airball it. They don't care. They don't even fucking hear it. They don't even hear it. Lebron James is not afraid to go to New York.

Speaker 1:          01:37:58       He wanted to win. All right? That's why the fuck he went to Miami. But uh, you know, and I would really love it and this is the deal if, if the fucking Lakers didn't exist, um, with this stupid tee shirts claiming that the Los Angeles Lakers have fucking 16, because that's what the t shirt says. It says Los Angeles Lakers 16 championships, not Los Angeles Slash Minneapolis Lakers. Um, so now I have to become a Miami heat fan. I really do. But just for the record, dude, I don't like any of this shit. I didn't like the 2008 Boston Celtics. I didn't like that either. Where you just go out and, and just everybody piles on one team. I don't fucking like it. I don't like this age of the super teams. It's a, yeah, I don't even, that's not, I don't know what it is anymore. It's like the, it's like a, it's sports are becoming like what wreath retail stores have become.

Speaker 1:          01:38:54       They're all like these super stores now. There's not like just the regular hardware store. That example, I use every podcast. It's always a hardware store with me, but fucking one trick pony. It's all fucking, it's all Walmarts now. Home depots best buys, all of that type of shit. And uh, I dunno, it's not the same kind of pride like, uh, that you had back in the day when you watched red Arrow back get some unknown center from Golden State. You know Robert Parish, who the fuck knew who he was before he came to the Celtics and he goes after Kevin Mchale wasn't a highly touted draft pick and then Larry Bird, he works on for like three fucking years and gets them to come to the Celtics like that with some interesting shit. But nowadays when you got shit like Kevin Mchale, a former Celtic is working for the grizzlies and he gives the fucking Celtics Kevin Garnett for nothing, for nothing.

Speaker 1:          01:39:57       Decimates an entire fucking franchise. The same way Jerry West is fucking working from Memphis and gives the fucking Lakers Pau Gasol for nothing. I mean, it's, I don't know. I don't fucking know. And the fact that these fucking knick fans are sitting there talking about that guy piling on as the god Damn Yankees are Erin negotiations to try to get cliff Lee. Like they don't have enough with fucking sabbatical. Aja Burnett, Marianna Rivera, fucking Alex Rodriguez, Al fucking to share all those guys. I love all the names of fading away cause I don't even watch baseball anymore. It's such a fucking stupid goddamn sport. Um, dude, if the Yankees got cliff Lee, you might as well just mail them the trophy, you know, and um, this is what it is. I Dunno if I'm just as crabby old man. I'm really trying to find the art in, uh, signing all these free agents because it just seems to me like whoever has the most fucking money will eventually get most of the best guys in.

Speaker 1:          01:41:05       Occasionally you'll lose out on a guy, occasionally a cliff Lee, we'll go to the rangers, you know, or somebody will pick the fucking angels or maybe they'll go to the fucking red sox or something like that. But generally speaking, you start with the fucking Yankees and then it just goes down. I Dunno, I just doesn't seem like there's any fucking skill that I had just spent over five. You know what it is. I'm on my fucking period this week, half hour a rag. Ragging about that shit. Let's get to uh, let's keep, let's just totally fucking, uh, make a left turn here. And, uh, somebody asked me some for some advices week. All right, here we go. This is, this is now, this is a quote. This is a situation that I think a lot of people that all embrace can deal with. Um, let's see here. Uh, hey bill, huge fan.

Speaker 1:          01:41:55       Love you. Comedy. Pull a good book, but the hope this won't get too long. Um, it starts with one of my good friends going out with this girl. Uh, they went out for a body of right off the bat. You know, you can't, can't you tell where this is going? This story starts with one of my good friends going out with this girl. They went out for about a year or two to honor on and off. Come on, Bill. Focus here. Just try to read this smoothly. All right, let's start over and starts with one of my good friends going out with this girl. They went out for about a year or two on and off. I'm still though, even when they were together, they were never really good in quotes.

Speaker 1:          01:42:39       Here we go. They fought basically all the time and just didn't seem right for each other though. G Gee, you know where this is going during the early stages of their relationship. My friend thought I had a thing for her old Judy. She's a, she is a good looking girl. She is a good looking girl and I was friends with her before they even got together. Dude, you are so justifying what the fuck you either did or about ready to do. I love it. They weren't really good for each other. Even when they were together, they just, there was something missing. I actually knew her before he did. Um, here we go. She is a good looking girl and I was friends with her before they were even together. I admit I might have inadvertently been a little flirty with her sometimes.

Speaker 1:          01:43:32       Oh, I'm sorry. It was I just flirting there. Do you have a future at uh, at BP the next time they pollute an entire Gulf of a nation that they're not even citizens of and they need to bring somebody out to stand behind the podium. Dude, this is fucking great. I might have inadvertently been a little flirty with her. How the fuck do you even do that? How do you inadvertently flirt with somebody? Why are you really look beautiful in that dress? I'll tell you if you will. My girlfriend, I have a debit. Duh. I mean, wait, what the fuck do you go with? Oh, I'm sorry. I'm sorry. That's right. You're not my girlfriend. I'm sorry. I thought you were my girlfriend for a second. What was I thinking? Jesus Christ. I'm so embarrassed. My face turning red. Oh my God. I was just inadvertently flirting with you right then.

Speaker 1:          01:44:18       Ah, Jesus. Uh, here we go. But he goes, this is what he says. I might have inadvertently been a little flirty with her sometimes, but that shit always happens with a guy and a girl. I think do the level of guilt just weighing you down as you're trying to justify all of this? Uh, either way I told him, um, I didn't like her, which was true dude, stop lying to yourself anyways, it passed. However, I always got this feeling that there was a, there was still an undertone that he resented me since then. Yeah. Probably because of all the inadvertent flirting and the fact that you were emoting that they weren't right for each other. Um, but anyways, let's, let's, let's fast forward as he says, fast forward now. They've been broken up for at least a year and don't talk. She says, uh, he randomly texts her Texas, her texts her, Jesus Christ. I can't even fucking read. She says he randomly texted her, but uh, that she doesn't ever answer him. But regardless of that, now this girl likes me. What? Oh my God, I didn't see that coming. Wait a minute. Anyways, but she actually likes me and basically says she wants to fuck my voice. Just cracked in the perfect.

Speaker 1:          01:45:40       Says she wants to fuck. Am I getting excited? I need some more throat coat here and basically says she wants to fuck. Um, she tells me stuff like she wishes she went out with me instead of him to begin with. Now I do all right with girls, but I don't have them lining up or anything. So I'm not trying to let a virtual shirt thing passed me by. Oh my God. And this is when it's getting Jerry Springer here. Uh, with most guys. I don't, I, I'd feel like they'd not care if I went forward or at least understand why I did.

Speaker 1:          01:46:20       Do you realize what you're saying? I think most guys wouldn't care if their best friend went out and bang their fucking ex-girlfriend within a year of them going out. I think that they'd understand. So anyways, he goes, I think most guys wanted to stand, but this buddy of mine is a little nuts and it's also a situation where he's the type of guy that if he were in my position, he do the same thing. Ah, dude, you just justifying, you don't even need my advice, you're going to do it. Um, my other friend who knows the whole situation says I should, but others I've talked to about it. Say I shouldn't. Uh, the last I talked to her, she said she wanted to hang out just me and her and then I should let her know when I want to. Uh, all right. I guess this seems getting kind of long.

Speaker 1:          01:47:13       I have one question. Do I have any justification and fucking this girl and two, if I do, would you say I should go through with it? Okay. All right, sir. There there's just this just a ton of shit going on here. Okay. Right off the bat. Um, you have to be honest with yourself. All right? You weren't inadvertently flirting with this girl. You actually probably, uh, like this girl before this guy even got with her. Or maybe the fact that the guy, your friend got with her and he was banging her, made you all of a sudden interested in her. See, I don't know you as a person, you could be a very sadistic, a human being. Actually, I'm going to go out on a limb and say you're not, because the fact that you actually give a fuck enough to write me and ask whether you should do this, that means you actually have some sort of guilt about it.

Speaker 1:          01:48:10       Um, so you won't get off on bang in your fucking, uh, best friends, ex-girlfriend a two. There's a lot of shit here that could blow up in your face. Okay? In a perfect world, all right, you're a man and you say, you know what a, that's not going to be worth the, the, the blow back. It's not going to be worth the fucking damage that I'm going to do. This guy's my best friend. I don't even though he would do it to me, I'm not going to do it to him. And then I also need to stop being friends with this guy because anybody who would go out and fuck my ex girlfriend within a year is not truly a friend. I need to get better friends. But despite all that, I'm still not going to do what the fuck he would have done just because he would've done it to me.

Speaker 1:          01:48:58       And you just walk away from the situation and you go out and you chat up some other fucking broads. That's, that is like, if you want to be knighted someday, buy one of those fucking broads over there and a in the castle in England, you know, if you want to go over there with Surf Surf Phil Collins looking on and get knighted, that's what the fuck you do. But if you're going to bang this broad, um, you've already fucked up. Okay. Fucking your best friend's ex girlfriend. It's like committing a murder you want is few people involved is humanly possible. I learned that on an episode of uninformed when we had a cop come in and me and my, uh, cohost Joe to Rosa were saying that, um, you know, we were trying to come up with how to commit the perfect murder. And I remember said, okay, I get me and a buddy of mine, he goes right there, you fucked up right there. You fucked up. He goes, the more people you bring in,

Speaker 15:         01:50:01       the bigger chance you have of getting caught. You know,

Speaker 1:          01:50:04       cause you're not going to rat yourself out. But the other guy, if he gets scared, might go down to the police station and try to cop a plea. All right? That's the same shit with this. If you're going to fuck your best friend's girl, ex-girlfriend, you don't go around and ask other friends going, dude, should I do with

Speaker 15:         01:50:22       you? Don't.

Speaker 1:          01:50:23       And you already did. All right. And then the other side of it is,

Speaker 15:         01:50:30       mmm, I don't know how the two of these people broke up, but uh, you know, Hell hath no fury like a woman scorned.

Speaker 1:          01:50:40       And for all, you know, this chick might be a fucking psycho. All right? I mean, I think it's a good thing

Speaker 15:         01:50:49       that he's texting her and not the other way around

Speaker 1:          01:50:52       and that she is not texting him back. Granted, you're taking her word for it, that that's what the situation is now. For all you know, it's the reverse. And if it is the reverse, she wants some sort of vengeance, which means she goes out and bangs his best friend and then low and behold feels guilty the next day and then has to tell him, all right, just to let you know

Speaker 15:         01:51:21       that is on the fucking table. If you really want to know whether or not you want a jerk, if you want a jerk, if you want to fucking, I got ahead of myself here. If you want to fuck this girl and not just go jerk off to her and after he had done, if you still want a Banger, you want a banger and then just fucking man up and deal with the fucking consequences of it and go out and bang her because who gives a fuck? Because someday you're going to be 80 and who gives a shit, you know? Or on the other side, if you actually have feelings for this girl, that's a whole, then you should definitely do it. If you actually feel like this girl could be the girl that you're going to spend your life with, then I would definitely say go for it. Knowing full well that your friendship with this other guy is, uh, is going to end. MMM. I Dunno. So Dude, you know what, it's fucking on you. You know, if you asked me what I do at a yeah, I would have back in the day I would have, but now that I'm an older, wiser man, I wouldn't, I would just fucking rub one out to her and then be afterwards going, oh, thank God I didn't fucking do that. Thank God I didn't do that. And I was, I would also fucking not hang out with the other guy because any guy friend of mine that would fuck an ex girlfriend of mine within a fucking year, I, I wouldn't want to be friends with.

Speaker 1:          01:52:38       Yeah.

Speaker 15:         01:52:38       Even though I just described all of my friends do it. I don't know what to tell you.

Speaker 1:          01:52:46       I don't know what to tell you. Um, you probably shouldn't do what you should. You shouldn't, dude, you should. And you should go out and go fucking bank somebody else. You shouldn't. All right. But I feel like a hypocrite because I would, I would. But then again, I'm also a fucking 42 year old guy. Never got married. So when, so you're listening to a complete fucking scumbag here. So Jesus Christ, this is why I don't have a fucking advice show, you know, because in my attempt to be honest, I, I, I, I tell you both things, do it. Don't do it. I would, but you shouldn't have a nice day.

Speaker 1:          01:53:27       Um, you know what? Let's, let's go to the listeners. I would love to hear from the women because they, they're going to have on both sides. They can have like, you shouldn't do that, your friend. And then they're also going to be mad on some level. Like why did guys feel like they own somebody just because they youth to go out with them? Because we are territorial, were territorial that way. And you have to understand that whoever you've banged in your life as a female, um, for the rest of your life, that pussies not yours anymore. It belongs to him. And you can say it's yours. It isn't because he fucked it.

Speaker 1:          01:54:08       All right? You know what? I, I feel like, you know, there wasn't enough ignorance on this podcast, so I feel like I had to just say something stupid like that. But that's how guys work. And, um, I didn't even ask you, this is your best friend. Is he bigger than you are physically? Can he beat you down? Does he take Jujitsu classes? Um, has he ever had any murderous thoughts that he, I'm sort of divulge to you at a, you know, a night of drinking too many Tequila shots and you see an agony, darker side of him. You know, there's, there's a whole bunch of Shit, ah, this is what she got to do. This is what you gotta do. Go out and get yourself a fucking pimp hat. All right? And this is what you have to do. You've got to go to this girl and you, you just got to lay it on the fucking table.

Speaker 1:          01:55:01       That's what you gotta do. You just gotta be honest with her and just say, look sweetheart, I have wanted to fuck you since 2006 you don't say that, but basically you finesse your way into that. You've got to tell her that you've wanted to hook up with her. And the only reason why you didn't, this is the deal. This is all right. Well, we had a little technical difficulty there. I left you hanging. Sorry about that. The batteries just died. I was right in the middle of trying to tell this dude how we could go out and bang this girl. Now I gotta fucking stick this into the goddamn girl garageband and splice it together, which I already did that this point. So why even bitch about it when you listen to this fucking thing? All right, let me wrap this Goddamn podcast up by telling this kid how to go out and fuck his best friend's ex girlfriend.

Speaker 1:          01:55:56       All right? This is what you do. You gotta, you gotta have a talk with this girl before you do it. Don't just go over there and just fucking sneak over there. You know, with this nervous excitement fucking rail, this girl bust your nut and then realize, oh my God, I have no fucking feelings for this girl. And then you know, risking that she'll then, you know, be resentful. All the bullshit I said on the first fucking installment of this Goddamn podcast, this is what you gotta do. You gotta fucking get everything out in the open. All right? In fucking let her convince you that it's the right fucking thing to do and get her to say that she ain't gonna say shit. All right. Get her to say that. And when she says she's not going to say Shit, you have to read her. All right?

Speaker 1:          01:56:49       Like a fucking seasoned goddamn pro. You know, the 27 fucking, uh, pantomimes align, whatever that fucking goddamn movie was true romance. You gotta look at her and Jay, you have to, you have to make a fucking assessment. If this girl can keep your fucking mouth shut by presenting these scenarios, you up. Look, I'm going to get worried that tomorrow. What if you're going to wake up feeling guilty and then you have to confess to him, you know, I'm not going to feel, I'm not gonna feel guilty. Yeah, you are. You're just fucking, I don't know. I'm really giving you shit advice. Do what? I'm trying to give you a fucking scumbag way to go out and go do this shit. Just like, I dunno. I'm fucking bad at this, man. I have to be in the moment that what the fuck dirtbag goddamn thing would I be saying?

Speaker 1:          01:57:42       All right, this is what you do. You don't go over a fucking places. What you do don't go over a goddamn place. See, this is the hard thing. Now you've got to go out. You've got to meet her in public. Okay? So there's no sexual fucking tension that you can act on. All right? So your Dick won't be like, dude, she's fine. She's not lying. She's not lying. She's going to be cool. What you have to do is, um, you're going to meet in a public place where then people can see a CTO. This is just a, it's just a fact. It's a, it's a tough one. Tell you why to do it. If you can actually fucking pull this off, why don't you write me back and tell you, tell, tell me how you, how the fuck he did it. I remember a long time ago, I was in the beginning of a relationship and I was banging is still banging this other psycho on the side and uh, like a dirt bag, you know? And I remember there was gonna be a point where the two of them were going to be at the same fucking place.

Speaker 15:         01:58:42       So I just dealt with it. But I, that was it before we hooked up,

Speaker 1:          01:58:47       I just said, look, you've got to be honest with you. This girl I'm coming down with, we're new. I'm starting to have feelings for

Speaker 15:         01:58:53       all right.

Speaker 1:          01:58:54       I told her that I cleaned up everything on the side, which I haven't with you, so I need you to not act weird

Speaker 15:         01:59:00       when I fucking come down there. If I don't, you know, if I'm not saying hello to you. Okay. That was before I hooked up with her. She's like, fine, fine.

Speaker 1:          01:59:08       And then when she went down there and then she did that. Cool. Because in her head she's probably holding out like maybe if I had cool, he'll see how fucking cool I am and then I want to be with me and not this other bitch. And meanwhile I fucking got away with it.

Speaker 15:         01:59:21       And you know what a part of me died? Another fucking chunk of my soul came out and said, dirty fucking game.

Speaker 1:          01:59:27       It's a dirty goddamn game. I'm a piece of shit. Don't fucking listen to me. All right, what else do we got this week? But by the way, dude, now that I've talked about a for 10 fucking minutes, you got, you got to write a Spec and let us know what happened.

Speaker 15:         01:59:42       All right?

Speaker 1:          01:59:45       You know, I realize this might be like one of those stupid Hollywood movies. And then I realized that's not the person I wanted to be it. If you do that, I don't want to fucking hear it. But if you don't, if you do the dirty bullshit, I want to hear about it.

Speaker 15:         01:59:59       Okay. Would I be the worst fucking life coach ever? Um, all right, here's a, here's a segment, corporate costs.

Speaker 1:          02:00:06       Hey Bill, for someone who flies as much as you do, can you take a shot at explaining the logic behind why a one way ticket almost costs more than a round trip.

Speaker 15:         02:00:18       Um, for a domestic fuck

Speaker 1:          02:00:19       for domestic flights, maybe this isn't a problem. However, I'm flying from your, uh, from Europe at the end of the month on a one way ticket and it costs one and a half times more than a round trip chip ticket. And I immediately said, well, why don't you buy the round trip ticket? And he addresses this immediately and says, and if the airline company can prove that I purchased a roundtrip ticket, it with the intent of not using the return for the flight, they can legally charge for the price difference between the fares. What the fuck is this normal business practice? I hate to tell you it, but it is because that's how corrupt are fucking government is. That's how powerful corporations are around the fucking world. They, they do whatever they, whatever they want to do.

Speaker 15:         02:01:05       And they have this thing where every quarter they have to show a profit, all right? Oh, actually they have to, to, to show more of a profit than the previous quarter. They can't even just have the same amount of profit. It's not enough. And basically they've legally run out of ways to create revenue streams. So what they're doing now is they're just stealing. They're stealing from people. All right? If you have a one way ticket, that means you're going home or you're starting a new life and you want to get the fuck out of where you're at. So that's why they know that they can charge you a ton of fucking money.

Speaker 1:          02:01:42       All right? And then we'll watch some buys, a round trip ticket, then we'll fucking, we'll just write this little bill here and we'll have the senator who we fucking paid for his goddamn campaign helped push it through. Isn't that how it works? They just call the senator. I don't know anything. Um, yeah, no, it's a piece of shit thing. So what you gotta do is you have to vandalize the airplane. All right? Do something to vandalize the fucking airplane. Now that you don't even do that, cause all they're going to do is just pass that expense onto us. This is what you have to do. Um, you have to find out who it is that came up with that. Who created that? Who was, uh, who was the lobbyist who push that thing through how that somehow became legal. You've got to find out where they live and then you just gotta.

Speaker 1:          02:02:30       You gotta tailor them the whole fucking week. Get their patterns down, figure out when they go to the Goddamn Jim. All Right, borrow a pair of pantyhose from your fucking girlfriend. Put it over your head, height and some shrubs. And when that dude comes walking out of the gym with that fucking towel around his neck, you just blast them right in the face and then you fucking choke them with it. Your choke him. You Mush his face into the mulch and you'd be like desperate, a one way ticket from fucking hall and back to the state yet can't, and then you get in your fucking Ford Festiva and you drive away. That's the only way to get back at him. And, uh, and if you do that, I'll give you a free DVD, a underrated overrated for the week, uh, underrated, the movie waiting. Uh, it's all about the world of restaurant waiters, cooks, it, et cetera.

Speaker 1:          02:03:21       It's funny, honest and quite gross. I imagine it is because I've worked in a couple of fucking restaurants in the shit that goes on. You know, the shit that you'll do when you're not cooking for a family member is really a, it's staggering. I'll leave it at that. Um, overrated. Um, this is pretty bitter. But anyways, when you watch the special features on a DVD and there's always the making of feature, far too many of these features, including the movie waiting, then I just recommended have the actors and the directors jokingly calling others on the film, useless, awful, amateur, amateurish, etc. Uh, they'll talk about how the whole film is a disaster and we'll, uh, and we'll go straight to video. Get it. They don't really mean it. They're joking around. Lol, lol. See, I told you it was a better one. Yeah, I guess, you know, I of understand, I mean, how many times can you just sit there and go, Aston Kutcher was absolutely brilliant in Madame of the butterfly or the butterfly effect, whatever the fuck it was called.

Speaker 1:          02:04:26       Um, that scene, his reaction here is right up with Bruce Willis in die hard part three. When he turns around and looks at the greenscreen and pretends to be looking at a jumbo jet, it was absolutely some of the best act. I mean, how long could you listen to that so they gotta make fun of themselves. Um, I would go with arrogance. I would just talk about my scenes and how fucking amazing I am. Um, while I was pointing out the dumb shit that I did in it, uh, youtube videos for the week and do this, I'm going to tell you, man, I think I'm recommending, or at least the listeners of my podcast, we're recommended some of the funniest and best fucking, uh, youtube videos out there. How great. Well those youtube videos last week, you know, all right, here's one duck face song search, duck face song like quack, quack, duck face song.

Speaker 1:          02:05:15       Um, this is an amazing one. Search, fake Yoyo trickster fool's, every TV station everywhere. I mean, granted it could have been shorter, but fake Yoyo trickster fool's, every TV station everywhere. This is hilarious. This guy goes on and he claims to be a Yoyo champion and he actually sucks at it and he talks all this shit and then he goes on there and he can't pull off any tricks and he just stands there and leaves the morning news guy with the awkwardness of him completely failing and not handling the failing and just leaving it in the lap of the reporter and it's, uh, it's fucking awesome. Um, AH, here's one for all you kids and I'm going to use the young kid where this one is epic. Um, this one isn't on Youtube. This is how cutting edge the Monday morning podcast is. Uh, go to www.everythingisterrible.com.

Speaker 1:          02:06:16       And then search for the video. This is hip hop and uh, it's awesome. It's a fucking white lady's soccer mom, you know, and she's going to let you know what time it is. I'm going to leave it at that. Everything is terrible.com. I'm a couple more, uh, for all you knick fans out there who are licking your wounds, go to go search a Lebron James Decision interview parody. I think you'll enjoy that one immensely. Uh, for all you death metal fans who have a sense of humor and because this one really hinges on actually knowing the song, there's a band called Cannibal corpse and the name of the song is hammer smashed face. And if you don't already know that song, I suggest you listen to it first. Listened to Cannibal corpse hammer smashed face for as long as you can, unless you're death metal fan. And then you'll love it, um, or a fan of comedy.

Speaker 1:          02:07:17       Um, and then go to search Cannibal Corpse Hammer, smash his face smashed face, Disney radio version, some fucking genius out there. Basically, you know, I guess death metal is a lot of like, I dunno, the darker cords and he turned them all, plays the same court but in a major court, which are they happier once and then he sings the song with the same lyrics. It's fucking great. Um, and that is it. You know what, I didn't bring up asides from fro hyping, uh, the month, uh, the MM podcast.com, um, is um, uh, and all of this Lebron Shit. I didn't really bring up like the fans of fucking Cleveland and yet another fucking blow that those people have to take. I mean that just, it's brutal between the industry leaving that town and then I'll, you know, cc Sabathia he went, ended up going in New York. Manny Ramirez went to Boston, Jim told went to Philly.

Speaker 1:          02:08:23       I mean, they had the team and now they finally get like fucking arguably, I would say the next Kobe level player. He's got a way to go. But the next Coby level player player in Lebron James gave him a reason to go to the downtown area. It sucks. It sucks because downtown Cleveland, if you really look at the buildings, if he can look, pass the scary homeless people and really look at the buildings, uh, it's beautiful. It's just that, you know, getting back to these corporate clients, they just pulled up stakes and they left because they were sick of paying people a fair wage and they were sick of having to pay for health insurance and they wanted to have some eight year old go put the fucking grill on a Goddamn fucking caprice classic. I don't fucking know. Same thing with Detroit. Those all those cities, Buffalo, all of them, if you look at them, the buildings, they're very, they're, they're beautiful cities and you can see what they used to be and it's a fucking shame. Um, I dunno, I dunno how to bring them back, you know, buy American, which is why I'm going to get the fucking challenger. Okay. And if I find out that it's actually put together down and fucking Honduras, I'm going to be fucking pissed. All right.

Speaker 1:          02:09:44       Al Challenger is dodge not put together in fucking whatever the fucking thing is. I'm going to learn Spanish. God dammit, and I'm going to have two podcasts. I'll have one in fucking a on glaze in one in fucking spend. Y'All, would that be great? Then I could find that I could actually trash people in their native language about how much soccer is fucking boring. All right. That is a, that's a podcast for this week.
