00:00:00.359 --> 00:00:04.192
(whooshing and beeping tones)

00:00:05.615 --> 00:00:09.460
(cheerful piano and string music)

00:00:09.460 --> 00:00:11.403
- [Man] We are the paradoxical ape,

00:00:12.360 --> 00:00:15.923
bipedal, naked, large-brained.

00:00:17.560 --> 00:00:20.713
Long the master of fire,
tools, and language,

00:00:21.630 --> 00:00:24.023
but still trying to understand ourselves.

00:00:25.910 --> 00:00:27.903
Aware that death is inevitable,

00:00:29.190 --> 00:00:30.863
yet filled with optimism.

00:00:32.500 --> 00:00:33.683
We grow up slowly.

00:00:34.840 --> 00:00:36.243
We hand down knowledge.

00:00:37.440 --> 00:00:39.283
We empathize and deceive.

00:00:40.920 --> 00:00:43.820
We shape the future from
our shared understanding

00:00:43.820 --> 00:00:44.693
of the past.

00:00:46.400 --> 00:00:50.160
CARTA brings together experts
from diverse disciplines,

00:00:50.160 --> 00:00:54.703
to exchange insights on who
we are and how we got here,

00:00:56.260 --> 00:01:00.030
an exploration made possible
by the generosity of humans,

00:01:00.030 --> 00:01:04.223
like you.
(uplifting orchestra music)

00:01:15.390 --> 00:01:18.890
(upbeat electronic music)

00:01:20.836 --> 00:01:24.336
(upbeat electronic music)

00:01:34.740 --> 00:01:36.280
- I like to start with this very, kind of,

00:01:36.280 --> 00:01:38.620
self-flattering question of:

00:01:38.620 --> 00:01:40.140
How do we get so smart?
(audience chuckles)

00:01:40.140 --> 00:01:43.620
How are we humans able to think about

00:01:43.620 --> 00:01:46.340
all of the complex and
sophisticated things

00:01:46.340 --> 00:01:47.173
that we think about?

00:01:47.173 --> 00:01:49.020
How do we invent them?

00:01:49.020 --> 00:01:50.620
And specifically, there's a puzzle

00:01:50.620 --> 00:01:53.440
because, ultimately,
we're physical creatures.

00:01:53.440 --> 00:01:56.610
And we get only physical
information from the world.

00:01:56.610 --> 00:01:59.540
So we get photons in our eyes.

00:01:59.540 --> 00:02:01.463
We get pressure waves in our ears.

00:02:02.710 --> 00:02:03.970
We're subject to gravity,

00:02:03.970 --> 00:02:06.630
and we bend our toes and flex our knees

00:02:06.630 --> 00:02:09.640
to try to defy gravity and stay upright.

00:02:09.640 --> 00:02:13.150
And we can push on things and
exert pressure on the world.

00:02:13.150 --> 00:02:16.650
And that somehow, through this
super-physical interaction,

00:02:16.650 --> 00:02:19.540
we end up with really fancy ideas.

00:02:19.540 --> 00:02:22.470
Like, we think about goals and principles

00:02:22.470 --> 00:02:24.510
and truth and justice.

00:02:24.510 --> 00:02:27.903
We invent ideas like time
travel and imaginary numbers.

00:02:28.910 --> 00:02:30.550
How do we do that?

00:02:30.550 --> 00:02:33.270
How does that set of physical interactions

00:02:33.270 --> 00:02:34.810
and brains that are evolved

00:02:34.810 --> 00:02:37.260
for these basic physical interactions,

00:02:37.260 --> 00:02:42.260
how do they create this wonderful,
abstract world of ideas?

00:02:43.780 --> 00:02:45.840
And these abstract ideas are the things

00:02:45.840 --> 00:02:48.680
that actually make
being human so much fun.

00:02:48.680 --> 00:02:51.210
So if you go to a dinner party,

00:02:51.210 --> 00:02:53.300
and the only things you talk about

00:02:53.300 --> 00:02:55.420
are physical, concrete things.

00:02:55.420 --> 00:02:59.281
Like if all you can say is,
"Boy, this podium is wooden

00:02:59.281 --> 00:03:01.437
(knocks on podium) "and solid."

00:03:02.470 --> 00:03:04.708
You're not gonna get invited
back to that dinner party.

00:03:04.708 --> 00:03:07.670
(audience chuckles)
The things that we talk about,

00:03:07.670 --> 00:03:10.020
the things that we obsess
about, all day long,

00:03:10.020 --> 00:03:11.800
are these abstract things.

00:03:11.800 --> 00:03:13.630
How do our minds create these?

00:03:13.630 --> 00:03:16.310
Now, this is a problem
that has vexed scholars

00:03:16.310 --> 00:03:17.860
for centuries.

00:03:17.860 --> 00:03:19.970
Plato thought about it,
so he thought about:

00:03:19.970 --> 00:03:24.010
How would you teach someone
an abstract idea, like virtue?

00:03:24.010 --> 00:03:26.950
And he ends up concluding
that it's impossible.

00:03:26.950 --> 00:03:29.940
And we can't learn these things,
so we must recollect them

00:03:29.940 --> 00:03:32.063
from past incarnations of our souls.

00:03:34.170 --> 00:03:35.930
Darwin, actually, also ran into this.

00:03:35.930 --> 00:03:38.320
So Alfred Wallace, the co-originator

00:03:38.320 --> 00:03:40.620
of the Theory of Evolution with Darwin,

00:03:40.620 --> 00:03:42.680
gave up on the Theory of Evolution

00:03:42.680 --> 00:03:45.450
because he got so vexed by this idea

00:03:45.450 --> 00:03:49.710
of how brains that evolved
for physical interaction,

00:03:49.710 --> 00:03:52.070
how natural selection could have created

00:03:52.070 --> 00:03:55.500
brains that then invent
symphonies or play chess

00:03:55.500 --> 00:03:58.230
or do any of the kinds of
complex things that we do.

00:03:58.230 --> 00:04:01.247
And Darwin tried to
intervene, writing to Wallace,

00:04:01.247 --> 00:04:02.927
"I hope you have not
murdered too completely

00:04:02.927 --> 00:04:04.310
"your own and my child."

00:04:04.310 --> 00:04:06.160
Don't throw the baby out with bathwater.

00:04:06.160 --> 00:04:07.933
We can save this evolution thing.

00:04:08.970 --> 00:04:13.400
So how do we actually
create these abstract ideas?

00:04:13.400 --> 00:04:15.890
I'm gonna give you one, specific example,

00:04:15.890 --> 00:04:18.240
and that is how we think about time.

00:04:18.240 --> 00:04:20.470
Now, I do a lotta work on time.

00:04:20.470 --> 00:04:22.700
I'm not the only one obsessed with time.

00:04:22.700 --> 00:04:24.770
The work "time" is actually
the most frequent noun

00:04:24.770 --> 00:04:25.603
in English.

00:04:26.670 --> 00:04:29.050
And that's kind of interesting because,

00:04:29.050 --> 00:04:30.460
of course, we can't see time.

00:04:30.460 --> 00:04:31.570
We can't touch time.

00:04:31.570 --> 00:04:32.590
We can't smell time.

00:04:32.590 --> 00:04:33.730
We can't taste time.

00:04:33.730 --> 00:04:35.010
It's abstract.

00:04:35.010 --> 00:04:36.060
But at the same time,

00:04:37.545 --> 00:04:39.410
it creates the very basis

00:04:39.410 --> 00:04:40.720
of our experience.

00:04:40.720 --> 00:04:43.020
You can't experience
anything outside of time.

00:04:43.870 --> 00:04:48.393
So how do we conceptualize
this abstract entity?

00:04:49.450 --> 00:04:51.930
I'll take it one step further and ask:

00:04:51.930 --> 00:04:53.820
How do we think about
something like time travel?

00:04:53.820 --> 00:04:55.110
How do we invent that idea?

00:04:55.110 --> 00:04:57.720
Of course, it's not
through physical experience

00:04:57.720 --> 00:04:59.280
of your own, with time travel.

00:04:59.280 --> 00:05:00.890
It's not because you actually traveled

00:05:00.890 --> 00:05:02.240
to some other time and came back,

00:05:02.240 --> 00:05:04.830
and now you can recollect that idea.

00:05:04.830 --> 00:05:06.220
So here's a story

00:05:06.220 --> 00:05:08.920
of how we might come up with
an idea like time travel.

00:05:09.850 --> 00:05:13.010
In lots of languages, we talk about time,

00:05:13.010 --> 00:05:14.750
using spatial metaphors.

00:05:14.750 --> 00:05:15.967
So we'll say things like,

00:05:15.967 --> 00:05:17.660
"We're approaching the holidays"

00:05:17.660 --> 00:05:20.277
or "We're coming up on Christmas."

00:05:20.277 --> 00:05:22.640
"We're coming up on the deadline."

00:05:22.640 --> 00:05:25.950
Well, if we're coming up on the holidays,

00:05:25.950 --> 00:05:28.240
time is a path on which I'm traveling.

00:05:28.240 --> 00:05:30.340
I'm traveling from the past to the future.

00:05:31.660 --> 00:05:33.763
Once you have that analogy
in place, that metaphor,

00:05:33.763 --> 00:05:36.430
that time is a path that you can travel,

00:05:36.430 --> 00:05:39.010
well, a path you can travel
in whatever direction you want

00:05:39.010 --> 00:05:40.620
and whatever speed you want.

00:05:40.620 --> 00:05:42.830
So once you set that analogy,

00:05:42.830 --> 00:05:44.090
you can now extend it

00:05:44.090 --> 00:05:45.960
and think about something that goes beyond

00:05:45.960 --> 00:05:47.790
what's possible in your
physical experience.

00:05:47.790 --> 00:05:50.010
You've invented the idea of time travel,

00:05:50.010 --> 00:05:52.780
just by extending this little analogy.

00:05:52.780 --> 00:05:54.580
There are a couple of
ingredients to that story.

00:05:54.580 --> 00:05:57.690
One is, you have to be
able to make an analogy

00:05:57.690 --> 00:06:01.150
between physical experience
and something more abstract.

00:06:01.150 --> 00:06:02.810
But also, something has to encourage you,

00:06:02.810 --> 00:06:04.230
invite you to make that analogy.

00:06:04.230 --> 00:06:06.057
Something has to say,
"Well, why don't you try

00:06:06.057 --> 00:06:08.470
"thinking about moving in
time, like moving in space?"

00:06:08.470 --> 00:06:10.120
And then, you can go beyond that.

00:06:11.490 --> 00:06:13.810
How do we know that any part of this story

00:06:13.810 --> 00:06:15.100
that I just told you is true,

00:06:15.100 --> 00:06:17.853
that people actually do
these kinds of extensions.

00:06:18.710 --> 00:06:20.560
Let me give you a couple of examples.

00:06:21.880 --> 00:06:25.510
In English, we actually have
two, kind of opposing ways

00:06:25.510 --> 00:06:27.030
of talking about time.

00:06:27.030 --> 00:06:29.810
One talks about ourselves as moving

00:06:29.810 --> 00:06:31.050
from the past to the future.

00:06:31.050 --> 00:06:33.050
We call this the "ego-moving" metaphor.

00:06:33.050 --> 00:06:36.680
And we say things like, "We're
approaching the deadline."

00:06:36.680 --> 00:06:38.940
The other one goes in
the opposite direction.

00:06:38.940 --> 00:06:41.690
We're stationary, and
time is moving past us,

00:06:41.690 --> 00:06:43.390
like a train or a river.

00:06:43.390 --> 00:06:45.320
We call this the "time-moving" metaphor.

00:06:45.320 --> 00:06:46.477
And so, you might say something like,

00:06:46.477 --> 00:06:48.790
"The deadline is approaching."

00:06:48.790 --> 00:06:52.030
Now, in a strict, physical sense,

00:06:52.030 --> 00:06:53.600
if I'm approaching the deadline

00:06:53.600 --> 00:06:55.600
or the deadline is approaching me,

00:06:55.600 --> 00:06:57.210
those are the same.

00:06:57.210 --> 00:07:01.270
If time is really a uni-directional,
one-dimensional entity,

00:07:01.270 --> 00:07:04.620
it doesn't actually matter
which one of us is moving.

00:07:04.620 --> 00:07:05.900
But in space, it matters.

00:07:05.900 --> 00:07:07.440
So if I'm moving towards you,

00:07:07.440 --> 00:07:09.090
or you're moving towards me,

00:07:09.090 --> 00:07:10.160
those two things are different

00:07:10.160 --> 00:07:12.340
because there's a fixed ground
against which we're moving.

00:07:12.340 --> 00:07:13.880
So we can actually tell the difference

00:07:13.880 --> 00:07:15.180
of which one is happening.

00:07:16.470 --> 00:07:18.667
How do we know if people
really think about

00:07:18.667 --> 00:07:21.030
"I'm approaching the
deadline" as being different

00:07:21.030 --> 00:07:22.600
from "The deadline is approaching"?

00:07:22.600 --> 00:07:26.170
Do people really take these
spatial metaphors seriously?

00:07:26.170 --> 00:07:27.723
Here's one hint.

00:07:28.610 --> 00:07:31.217
Suppose I ask you: "Next
Wednesday's meeting

00:07:31.217 --> 00:07:33.957
"has been moved forward two days.

00:07:33.957 --> 00:07:36.698
"What day is the meeting, now
that it's been rescheduled?"

00:07:36.698 --> 00:07:38.833
(audience murmurs)
Who thinks Monday?

00:07:40.060 --> 00:07:41.940
Who thinks Friday?

00:07:41.940 --> 00:07:43.683
Okay, it's about normal.

00:07:44.660 --> 00:07:47.470
So if you're thinking of
time moving towards you,

00:07:47.470 --> 00:07:49.240
then moving the meeting forward

00:07:49.240 --> 00:07:52.380
is moving the meeting in the
direction of motion of time,

00:07:52.380 --> 00:07:53.950
from Wednesday to Monday.

00:07:53.950 --> 00:07:56.610
But if you think of yourself
as moving through time,

00:07:56.610 --> 00:07:58.880
then moving the meeting forward is

00:07:58.880 --> 00:08:01.150
moving the meeting in
your direction of motion,

00:08:01.150 --> 00:08:03.160
from Wednesday to Friday.

00:08:03.160 --> 00:08:06.090
And we can actually get people to imagine

00:08:06.090 --> 00:08:07.600
motion in space.

00:08:07.600 --> 00:08:09.777
So, for example, we'd say,
"Imagine how you'd maneuver

00:08:09.777 --> 00:08:10.800
"the chair to the X."

00:08:10.800 --> 00:08:13.360
And you either have to
imagine yourself scooting

00:08:13.360 --> 00:08:14.770
in a chair, somewhere.

00:08:14.770 --> 00:08:17.990
Or you imagine pulling a
rope to bring a chair to you.

00:08:17.990 --> 00:08:20.190
So in one case, you're
imagining yourself moving.

00:08:20.190 --> 00:08:22.360
In the other case, something
is coming towards you.

00:08:22.360 --> 00:08:24.850
And after people have
imagined one or the other,

00:08:24.850 --> 00:08:28.000
we slip in the seemingly
unrelated question about time.

00:08:28.000 --> 00:08:29.607
We say, "Next Wednesday's meeting has been

00:08:29.607 --> 00:08:30.447
"moved forward two days.

00:08:30.447 --> 00:08:32.020
"What day is the meeting?"

00:08:32.020 --> 00:08:34.240
And what we find is, people
who have been imagining

00:08:34.240 --> 00:08:36.540
themselves moving forward through space

00:08:36.540 --> 00:08:38.670
will say the meeting is now on Friday.

00:08:38.670 --> 00:08:41.750
People who have been imagining
something coming towards them

00:08:41.750 --> 00:08:43.860
will say the meeting is now on Monday.

00:08:43.860 --> 00:08:46.750
Course, they don't know that
they're being influenced

00:08:46.750 --> 00:08:49.210
by this imagination
exercise that we gave them.

00:08:49.210 --> 00:08:51.830
But what it's telling us is,
people are actively using

00:08:51.830 --> 00:08:55.883
the spatial image that they
created to think about time.

00:08:57.050 --> 00:08:58.730
Actually, these two scenarios in time

00:08:58.730 --> 00:09:00.703
are psychologically different from them.

00:09:01.680 --> 00:09:03.960
Now, the other thing about
how we think about time

00:09:03.960 --> 00:09:07.380
is that it differs from
culture to culture.

00:09:07.380 --> 00:09:09.940
So humans haven't invented just one way

00:09:09.940 --> 00:09:10.773
of thinking about time.

00:09:10.773 --> 00:09:12.970
But we invented many, many different ways.

00:09:12.970 --> 00:09:15.560
Let me give you just a few examples.

00:09:15.560 --> 00:09:18.740
So in English, of
course, we read and write

00:09:18.740 --> 00:09:20.300
from left to right.

00:09:20.300 --> 00:09:23.280
And it's natural to then
organize all kinds of things

00:09:23.280 --> 00:09:24.113
from left to right.

00:09:24.113 --> 00:09:26.610
So here, I'm showing you
pictures of my grandfather

00:09:26.610 --> 00:09:27.610
at different ages.

00:09:27.610 --> 00:09:30.210
And if I gave you this set
of cards, shuffled them,

00:09:30.210 --> 00:09:32.870
and said, "Please lay them
out in a correct order,"

00:09:32.870 --> 00:09:34.930
chances are you would lay
them out exactly like this,

00:09:34.930 --> 00:09:35.810
from left to right.

00:09:35.810 --> 00:09:38.070
We consider this to be the correct order,

00:09:38.070 --> 00:09:39.910
the correct arrangement.

00:09:39.910 --> 00:09:42.720
But people who read and
write from right to left,

00:09:42.720 --> 00:09:45.440
for example, people who
read Arabic or Hebrew,

00:09:45.440 --> 00:09:48.060
will organize these
cards from right to left.

00:09:48.060 --> 00:09:50.460
So for them, the direction of time

00:09:50.460 --> 00:09:52.100
goes in the opposite direction.

00:09:52.100 --> 00:09:54.870
And just to give you
an intuition for this,

00:09:54.870 --> 00:09:58.610
here's a logo for a nutritional
supplement for kids.

00:09:58.610 --> 00:10:00.640
And you can read this logo very easily,

00:10:00.640 --> 00:10:03.600
and you can see what
it does for your child.

00:10:03.600 --> 00:10:05.970
When they tried using this
in Arabic-speaking countries,

00:10:05.970 --> 00:10:07.920
they ran into some problems
(audience chuckles)

00:10:07.920 --> 00:10:11.720
because if you read the
logo from right to left,

00:10:11.720 --> 00:10:13.740
it becomes quite
problematic and confusing,

00:10:13.740 --> 00:10:15.140
what it does for your child.

00:10:18.040 --> 00:10:19.980
Now, so far, I've given you examples

00:10:19.980 --> 00:10:22.360
of how time can travel
with respect to the body,

00:10:22.360 --> 00:10:24.960
either left to right or right to left.

00:10:24.960 --> 00:10:28.840
But it can also travel not with
respect to the body at all.

00:10:28.840 --> 00:10:30.163
So here's an example.

00:10:31.530 --> 00:10:33.730
This is an aboriginal
community in Australia

00:10:33.730 --> 00:10:34.870
that I had a chance to work with.

00:10:34.870 --> 00:10:36.820
They live on the edge of Cape York.

00:10:36.820 --> 00:10:38.260
They're the Kuuk Thaayore people.

00:10:38.260 --> 00:10:40.830
And what's interesting about
languages like Kuuk Thaayore

00:10:40.830 --> 00:10:43.610
is they don't use words
like "left" and "right."

00:10:43.610 --> 00:10:46.137
Instead, they primarily
rely on words like,

00:10:46.137 --> 00:10:47.790
"north," "south," "east," and "west,"

00:10:47.790 --> 00:10:49.233
cardinal direction terms.

00:10:50.160 --> 00:10:52.360
And when I say they primarily rely

00:10:52.360 --> 00:10:53.600
on cardinal direction terms,

00:10:53.600 --> 00:10:55.610
I really mean that at all scales.

00:10:55.610 --> 00:10:57.797
So even for body parts, you would say,

00:10:57.797 --> 00:11:00.070
"There's an ant on your southwest leg"

00:11:00.070 --> 00:11:02.355
or "Move your cup to the
north/northeast a little bit,"

00:11:02.355 --> 00:11:04.720
(cup taps on podium)
things like that.

00:11:04.720 --> 00:11:06.560
Even the way you say
"hello," in Kuuk Thaayore

00:11:06.560 --> 00:11:09.110
is to say, "Which way are you heading?"

00:11:09.110 --> 00:11:11.127
And the answer should be something like,

00:11:11.127 --> 00:11:12.917
"North/northwest, in the far distance.

00:11:12.917 --> 00:11:13.787
"How about you?"

00:11:14.870 --> 00:11:18.830
So imagine, as you walk around
your day, everyone you greet,

00:11:18.830 --> 00:11:20.706
you have to report your heading direction.

00:11:20.706 --> 00:11:22.700
(audience chuckles)
That would get you oriented

00:11:22.700 --> 00:11:23.770
really quickly, right?

00:11:23.770 --> 00:11:26.620
Because, literally, you
could not get past "hello"

00:11:26.620 --> 00:11:29.310
without knowing which way is which.

00:11:29.310 --> 00:11:32.370
And let's just establish that
we don't think like this.

00:11:32.370 --> 00:11:34.270
Everyone close your eyes for a second.

00:11:35.630 --> 00:11:37.210
And I can see you, so I
can tell whether or not

00:11:37.210 --> 00:11:38.910
you've closed your eyes.

00:11:38.910 --> 00:11:42.633
Point southeast.
(audience chuckles)

00:11:48.660 --> 00:11:50.840
All right, you can open your eyes.

00:11:50.840 --> 00:11:53.297
I see points in every possible direction.

00:11:53.297 --> 00:11:55.180
(audience laughs)
At least,

00:11:55.180 --> 00:11:57.680
some of you are right.
(audience laughs)

00:11:57.680 --> 00:11:58.513
That's good.

00:11:59.950 --> 00:12:03.370
So people who speak
languages like Kuuk Thaayore

00:12:03.370 --> 00:12:05.600
actually stay oriented really well.

00:12:05.600 --> 00:12:07.490
They can point southeast
without hesitation.

00:12:07.490 --> 00:12:09.133
Even young children can do that.

00:12:10.260 --> 00:12:12.800
But I also wondered: How
do they think about time?

00:12:12.800 --> 00:12:15.260
So if they don't think
about left and right,

00:12:15.260 --> 00:12:17.800
with respect to space,
how do they lay out time?

00:12:17.800 --> 00:12:19.810
So remember, if I give you this task,

00:12:19.810 --> 00:12:21.980
I give you a bunch of cards to lay out.

00:12:21.980 --> 00:12:23.400
What would they do?

00:12:23.400 --> 00:12:25.650
So here's an example.

00:12:25.650 --> 00:12:27.220
This is one participant.

00:12:27.220 --> 00:12:28.760
They're sitting, facing south.

00:12:28.760 --> 00:12:30.420
And this is a bunch of different card sets

00:12:30.420 --> 00:12:31.590
they've laid out.

00:12:31.590 --> 00:12:33.730
And what they've done
is go from left to right

00:12:33.730 --> 00:12:34.733
in each case.

00:12:35.590 --> 00:12:37.330
Here's another participant.

00:12:37.330 --> 00:12:38.690
I'm sorry; this is the same participant

00:12:38.690 --> 00:12:40.920
on a different day, sitting facing north.

00:12:40.920 --> 00:12:44.313
And they've laid everything
out, now, from right to left.

00:12:45.720 --> 00:12:48.180
Here's a different person,
sitting, facing east.

00:12:48.180 --> 00:12:49.610
And they've laid everything out,

00:12:49.610 --> 00:12:50.813
coming towards the body.

00:12:51.730 --> 00:12:53.450
What's the pattern?

00:12:53.450 --> 00:12:55.720
It's the sun, from east to west.

00:12:55.720 --> 00:12:59.150
So for them, time is
locked on the landscape.

00:12:59.150 --> 00:13:01.030
It doesn't stay locked on the body.

00:13:01.030 --> 00:13:03.090
So for me, as an English speaker,

00:13:03.090 --> 00:13:05.320
if I'm facing this way,
then time goes this way.

00:13:05.320 --> 00:13:07.410
And if I'm facing this way,
then time goes this way.

00:13:07.410 --> 00:13:10.000
And if I'm facing this way,
then time goes this way.

00:13:10.000 --> 00:13:13.430
Very egocentric of me to
make the dimension of time

00:13:13.430 --> 00:13:16.040
chase me around, every
time I turn my body.

00:13:16.040 --> 00:13:17.410
Instead, for the Kuuk Thaayore,

00:13:17.410 --> 00:13:18.980
time always goes in the same direction,

00:13:18.980 --> 00:13:20.210
with respect to the landscape,

00:13:20.210 --> 00:13:22.900
regardless of which way
their body is facing.

00:13:22.900 --> 00:13:25.030
And this isn't the only
way that time can flow,

00:13:25.030 --> 00:13:26.250
according to the landscape.

00:13:26.250 --> 00:13:28.320
So, for example, a work by Rafael Nunez,

00:13:28.320 --> 00:13:31.530
here at UCSD, shows that
time doesn't even have

00:13:31.530 --> 00:13:32.630
to go in a straight line.

00:13:32.630 --> 00:13:35.140
So, for example, for the
Yupno of Papua, New Guinea,

00:13:35.140 --> 00:13:37.880
time flows into the village at one angle.

00:13:37.880 --> 00:13:39.090
And then, once it hits the village,

00:13:39.090 --> 00:13:41.190
it takes a turn and flows
out at a different angle.

00:13:41.190 --> 00:13:42.210
And this has to do with

00:13:42.210 --> 00:13:43.940
the mouth and the source
of the Yupno River,

00:13:43.940 --> 00:13:46.550
which are important
geographical locations.

00:13:46.550 --> 00:13:48.890
So people around the world have imagined

00:13:48.890 --> 00:13:52.930
all kinds of ways to organize
this very basic dimension,

00:13:52.930 --> 00:13:55.280
whether it goes left to
right, right to left.

00:13:55.280 --> 00:13:57.460
There are vertical organizations,

00:13:57.460 --> 00:13:59.080
organizations that go on the landscape,

00:13:59.080 --> 00:14:01.370
in all kinds of different ways.

00:14:01.370 --> 00:14:04.300
There's a really rich variety
that humans have invented,

00:14:04.300 --> 00:14:05.150
around the world.

00:14:06.560 --> 00:14:09.850
Now, you could ask: How
deeply rooted is this

00:14:09.850 --> 00:14:12.510
imagined time, in our idea of space?

00:14:12.510 --> 00:14:16.640
So if you were to disable
the part of the brain

00:14:16.640 --> 00:14:19.160
that processes a particular part of space,

00:14:19.160 --> 00:14:22.480
would that also disrupt
our ability to imagine

00:14:22.480 --> 00:14:24.380
that part of time?

00:14:24.380 --> 00:14:26.610
And we actually had a
chance to test this idea,

00:14:26.610 --> 00:14:28.710
by looking at patients
who've suffered strokes

00:14:28.710 --> 00:14:30.200
in their right parietal lobe.

00:14:30.200 --> 00:14:32.370
So here, I'm showing you the
brain of Federico Fellini,

00:14:32.370 --> 00:14:35.210
after he suffered a stroke
in his right parietal lobe.

00:14:35.210 --> 00:14:38.920
And this kind of stroke
often results in neglect,

00:14:38.920 --> 00:14:41.170
on the opposite side of the stroke.

00:14:41.170 --> 00:14:44.010
If you have left neglect,
in everyday life,

00:14:44.010 --> 00:14:47.860
you might not notice food on
the left side of your plate.

00:14:47.860 --> 00:14:49.940
You might only eat the food on
the ride side of your plate,

00:14:49.940 --> 00:14:51.440
even though you're still hungry.

00:14:51.440 --> 00:14:54.070
You might only put makeup
on one side of your face

00:14:54.070 --> 00:14:55.910
or shave one side of your face.

00:14:55.910 --> 00:14:58.970
You might only read words
on one side of the page.

00:14:58.970 --> 00:15:01.960
People with neglect seem to not notice,

00:15:01.960 --> 00:15:04.440
not pay attention to,
things on the left side

00:15:04.440 --> 00:15:05.760
of space, for them.

00:15:05.760 --> 00:15:07.320
This member of Kiss doesn't have neglect

00:15:07.320 --> 00:15:08.153
as far as I know.

00:15:08.153 --> 00:15:09.780
But this is how he would do his makeup,

00:15:09.780 --> 00:15:11.850
if he would.
(audience chuckles)

00:15:11.850 --> 00:15:15.840
So we wondered: How would patients,

00:15:15.840 --> 00:15:19.000
who neglect the left side
of space, think about time?

00:15:19.000 --> 00:15:23.730
So we told patients about a guy, David,

00:15:23.730 --> 00:15:25.970
fictional guy, David, who
likes doing some things

00:15:25.970 --> 00:15:28.250
10 years ago and will like
doing different things,

00:15:28.250 --> 00:15:29.700
10 years from now.

00:15:29.700 --> 00:15:31.560
So 10 years ago, he liked strawberries,

00:15:31.560 --> 00:15:33.600
but 10 years from now,
he will like cherries.

00:15:33.600 --> 00:15:35.750
And they just had to remember these facts.

00:15:35.750 --> 00:15:37.940
And we had a couple of control groups.

00:15:37.940 --> 00:15:39.340
We had healthy controls

00:15:39.340 --> 00:15:41.210
and also patients who'd had a stroke,

00:15:41.210 --> 00:15:43.290
but didn't show signs of neglect.

00:15:43.290 --> 00:15:46.240
So let me show you data from
the two control groups, first.

00:15:47.300 --> 00:15:49.640
So the solid bars, here, show you

00:15:49.640 --> 00:15:51.090
the items that people got right.

00:15:51.090 --> 00:15:53.490
And everything to the right of the center

00:15:53.490 --> 00:15:54.810
is things to do with the future.

00:15:54.810 --> 00:15:56.140
Everything to the left of the center

00:15:56.140 --> 00:15:57.910
is things to do with the past.

00:15:57.910 --> 00:16:00.940
The shaded areas are where
people made mistakes.

00:16:00.940 --> 00:16:03.700
Now, of course, both
groups made some mistakes,

00:16:03.700 --> 00:16:05.240
but the mistakes are symmetrical,

00:16:05.240 --> 00:16:07.620
around the past and the future.

00:16:07.620 --> 00:16:10.860
Here's what the neglect
patients look like.

00:16:10.860 --> 00:16:14.060
They were heavily shifted to the right.

00:16:14.060 --> 00:16:15.940
They weren't able to recognize, correctly,

00:16:15.940 --> 00:16:17.530
things that had do with the past,

00:16:17.530 --> 00:16:20.880
with the left side of the mental timeline.

00:16:20.880 --> 00:16:24.269
And instead, they misattributed
a whole lot of things

00:16:24.269 --> 00:16:26.630
to the right.

00:16:26.630 --> 00:16:29.330
So when you damage the part of the brain

00:16:29.330 --> 00:16:32.560
that's responsible for representing
the left side of space,

00:16:32.560 --> 00:16:35.614
you also damage the imagined left,

00:16:35.614 --> 00:16:39.483
the time that you imagine on
the left side of your body.

00:16:41.220 --> 00:16:43.530
Now, I've been giving
a lot of examples about

00:16:43.530 --> 00:16:45.460
how we imagine time and space

00:16:45.460 --> 00:16:48.330
and how metaphors and cultural artifacts,

00:16:48.330 --> 00:16:51.280
like reading and writing, invite us to

00:16:51.280 --> 00:16:53.870
make different kinds of analogies.

00:16:53.870 --> 00:16:56.520
But, of course, these ideas go far beyond

00:16:56.520 --> 00:16:57.520
how we think about time.

00:16:57.520 --> 00:17:01.640
Because metaphors are
ubiquitous in our experience.

00:17:01.640 --> 00:17:05.106
Just about anything that's
complex or interesting

00:17:05.106 --> 00:17:08.890
is at least partially imagined.

00:17:08.890 --> 00:17:11.790
And the way we talk about these complex,

00:17:11.790 --> 00:17:14.270
interesting things is
suffused with metaphor.

00:17:14.270 --> 00:17:17.270
So if you're talking about
a relationship problem,

00:17:17.270 --> 00:17:21.057
you might say, "Well,
we're spinning our wheels.

00:17:21.057 --> 00:17:22.989
"Our relationship is off track."

00:17:22.989 --> 00:17:25.807
If we're talking about the
economy, you might say,

00:17:25.807 --> 00:17:27.470
"We need to jump-start the economy."

00:17:27.470 --> 00:17:29.560
And the idea is that a quick stimulus

00:17:29.560 --> 00:17:32.380
is what the economy needs,
to get going, again.

00:17:32.380 --> 00:17:34.780
Or you might say that we
need "prop up the economy."

00:17:34.780 --> 00:17:35.720
And then, you're using

00:17:35.720 --> 00:17:38.410
a different set of physical metaphors,

00:17:38.410 --> 00:17:41.010
to think about what needs to happen.

00:17:41.010 --> 00:17:43.367
When we talk theories or
ideas, we could talk about

00:17:43.367 --> 00:17:47.200
"poking holes" or "warming up to ideas."

00:17:47.200 --> 00:17:49.160
With social issues, we talk about

00:17:49.160 --> 00:17:51.440
immigrants as "seeping into the country,"

00:17:51.440 --> 00:17:54.410
as if they're some kind
of nefarious substance

00:17:54.410 --> 00:17:58.350
or crime as "preying" or
"infecting" our neighborhoods.

00:17:58.350 --> 00:18:01.070
And these metaphors have
psychological weight.

00:18:01.070 --> 00:18:04.500
So, for example, in our
lab, we've looked at

00:18:04.500 --> 00:18:07.260
how people want to approach
a crime problem in a city.

00:18:07.260 --> 00:18:09.260
If you tell them that "Crime is a beast,

00:18:10.447 --> 00:18:12.520
"plaguing their city" or
"preying on their city,"

00:18:12.520 --> 00:18:14.610
as opposed to "Crime is a virus."

00:18:14.610 --> 00:18:16.510
If you tell them, "Crime is a beast,"

00:18:16.510 --> 00:18:19.300
they want to do the kinds of things

00:18:19.300 --> 00:18:21.000
you would normally do to contain a beast.

00:18:21.000 --> 00:18:23.830
So they want harsher enforcement measures.

00:18:23.830 --> 00:18:25.620
If you tell them, "Crime is a virus,"

00:18:25.620 --> 00:18:28.640
they want to take a more
epidemiological approach.

00:18:28.640 --> 00:18:30.410
They wanna diagnose the problem,

00:18:30.410 --> 00:18:32.243
maybe inoculate the population,

00:18:33.120 --> 00:18:35.370
do things that are more reform-oriented.

00:18:35.370 --> 00:18:37.920
So these metaphors have
real, psychological weight.

00:18:38.910 --> 00:18:43.043
So coming back to this question
of: How do we get so smart?

00:18:44.120 --> 00:18:47.330
My answer would be that
our brains are masters

00:18:47.330 --> 00:18:51.960
at doing dynamic, opportunistic bricolage.

00:18:51.960 --> 00:18:55.150
They recycle and reuse
machinery that has evolved

00:18:55.150 --> 00:18:58.230
for simple, perceptual motor tasks.

00:18:58.230 --> 00:19:00.740
They recycle and reuse the
knowledge that we acquire

00:19:00.740 --> 00:19:03.000
through physical experience.

00:19:03.000 --> 00:19:06.770
But also, language is an
incredibly powerful tool

00:19:06.770 --> 00:19:09.240
that invites us to conjure up those ideas

00:19:09.240 --> 00:19:12.070
and recombine them in
all kinds of novel ways

00:19:12.070 --> 00:19:14.840
because language supplies
us with a large stock

00:19:14.840 --> 00:19:18.700
of units, but an infinite
ability to recombine them.

00:19:18.700 --> 00:19:21.860
So I can, right now,
take a bunch of words,

00:19:21.860 --> 00:19:24.360
put them in a new configuration

00:19:24.360 --> 00:19:25.900
and invite you to imagine something

00:19:25.900 --> 00:19:27.120
you've never imagined before.

00:19:27.120 --> 00:19:32.120
So I could say, "Imagine
a circle of hedgehogs

00:19:32.207 --> 00:19:34.937
"dancing the polka on top of a crepe

00:19:34.937 --> 00:19:36.347
"that is traveling through time,

00:19:36.347 --> 00:19:38.627
"from paleolithic times to now,

00:19:38.627 --> 00:19:40.117
"to puzzle us about how they are able

00:19:40.117 --> 00:19:42.960
"to make such fine,
thin pastry, back then."

00:19:42.960 --> 00:19:46.920
(audience laughs)
Now, if everything

00:19:46.920 --> 00:19:49.020
has gone relatively well
in your life, so far,

00:19:49.020 --> 00:19:51.282
you haven't had that
thought before, right?

00:19:51.282 --> 00:19:55.103
(audience laughs)
And so, you're welcome.

00:19:57.180 --> 00:19:58.900
That is through the power of language,

00:19:58.900 --> 00:20:01.080
we can conjure up all kinds of ideas,

00:20:01.080 --> 00:20:03.330
an infinite set of new ideas,

00:20:03.330 --> 00:20:06.510
by recombining things from
our physical experience

00:20:06.510 --> 00:20:09.700
and from other abstract ideas
we've built in the past.

00:20:09.700 --> 00:20:13.383
Thank you very much.
(audience applause)

00:20:16.052 --> 00:20:19.552
