00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.000
Let's talk about Whitespace for a moment.

00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:05.000
You may have noticed, when I was entering text in the editor before,

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:07.000
that even though I put text on multiple lines--

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:09.000
when I rendered it in HTML,

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:11.000
it rendered all on a single line.

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:13.000
This is because, in HTML, all Whitespace--

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:15.000
new lines, tabs, spaces--

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:17.000
all turn into a single space.

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:19.000
To force our HTML to have multiple lines,

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:21.000
we can use another tag called the "br" tag.

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:23.000
It looks like this: .

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:25.000
It is also a "void" tag.

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:27.000
It stands for "break"--

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:29.000
and it's a tag--

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:33.000
and you put this after any lines that you want to appear on multiple lines.

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:36.000
Let's play around with this in the browser a little bit.

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:40.000
Here we are in the browser--let's enter some text.

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:43.000
We've got this text that's really too long for one line,

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:47.000
and when we render this, it appears as one line.

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:49.000
Let's put a little line break here.

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:51.000
When I render this,

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:53.000
it still appears as one line.

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:55.000
If we want to render multiple lines,

00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:59.000
we can enter the tag, like here--no problem.

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:02.000
And now we have a line break, and we can even enter

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:06.000
multiple tags if we want multiple line breaks.

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:08.000
Okay. There we go.

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:11.000
Two line breaks--or two equals two line breaks,

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:13.000
Cool, huh?

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:15.000
Another way of doing line breaks

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:17.000
is to use the tag.

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:20.000
This stands for "paragraph".

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:22.000
This is not a tag.

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:24.000
So the tag has content and it looks like this.

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:26.000
So because it's not a tag,

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:28.000
it has a closing tag

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:30.000
and we have an opening tag.

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:33.000
So you've got: opening , content, closing .

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:36.000
And this will render as one paragraph.

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:39.000
Let's check this out on the browser really quick.

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:42.000
Okay--so we've got these two lines; let's take a different approach.

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:46.000
I'm going to start this line with a paragraph tag

00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:48.000
and we'll render this.

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:50.000
Aha! Now we've got a line break here in our text.

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:55.000
Now the font got bigger and that's kind of a side effect of our HTML tool.

00:01:55.000 --> 00:01:59.000
There must be some sort of style set on "p"--that doesn't normally happen.

00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:04.000
I'm going to wrap the bottom line with the paragraph as well.

00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:06.000
Okay. There we go--now we've got two lines--

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:09.000
the same kind of basic idea as we had before.

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:11.000
Now, we'll talk about why there's this extra space in here,

00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:14.000
even though there's no space between this text up here.

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:16.000
We'll come to that in a minute--but first,

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:18.000
quiz time.

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:22.000
Take this text, here: "Hello everyone! We're using two lines now!"

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:25.000
and enter the HTML to draw that,

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:30.121
as it's formatted here--with two lines--and I want you to use the tag.
