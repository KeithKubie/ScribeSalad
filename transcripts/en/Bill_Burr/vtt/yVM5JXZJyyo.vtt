00:00:10.340 --> 00:00:14.810
I'm up to episode eight,
season three.
I got two more episodes to go.

3
00:00:15.110 --> 00:00:18.200
That show.
That series is gut wrenching.

4
00:00:18.360 --> 00:00:23.140
Like I can only watch two of them and then I have to shut it off.
And I,

5
00:00:23.280 --> 00:00:26.300
I've never watched the show where I get so mad at the characters,

6
00:00:28.010 --> 00:00:32.360
you know?
I guess so fucking mad.
Like why the fuck did you just do that?
Shut up,

7
00:00:32.361 --> 00:00:36.380
stop talking.
All of that stuff.
Most of it's what the Kevin Character.

8
00:00:38.010 --> 00:00:38.330
<v 1>MMM.</v>

00:00:38.330 --> 00:00:40.290
<v 2>And
he's,</v>

10
00:00:41.390 --> 00:00:44.630
he's just lying on the floor and I,
I don't think he's crazy.

11
00:00:45.790 --> 00:00:50.240
Stop talking
fast.
Your favor.
Judo.

12
00:00:50.420 --> 00:00:51.860

17
00:01:06.830 --> 00:01:10.860
who's absolutely killing it.
His name is Jamie Mcshane.

18
00:01:10.890 --> 00:01:13.470
And for breaking bad fans,
if you are wondering,

19
00:01:13.500 --> 00:01:16.170

If you're a breaking bad fit the episode,

22
00:01:27.721 --> 00:01:31.050
I'm not going to give anything away.
The one that involved the train.

23
00:01:32.430 --> 00:01:35.460
All right.

What's the trouble with it?
No clue.

27
00:01:55.520 --> 00:01:59.830
I just driving down the road off the old couches bellied up and died on me.
Hey,

28
00:01:59.831 --> 00:02:02.150

How could she do?

29
00:02:02.720 --> 00:02:03.990
That's why they call you an engineer,

30
00:02:07.670 --> 00:02:09.750
<v 1>Get in there.

34
00:02:22.121 --> 00:02:24.540
I Dunno,

35
00:02:24.640 --> 00:02:28.450
