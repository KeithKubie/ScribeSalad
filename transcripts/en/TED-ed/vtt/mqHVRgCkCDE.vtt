00:00:09.745 --> 00:00:11.690
Everybody loves fireworks --

00:00:11.690 --> 00:00:12.934
the lights, the colors,

00:00:12.934 --> 00:00:15.497
and, of course, the big boom.

00:00:15.497 --> 00:00:16.881
But the history of fireworks

00:00:16.881 --> 00:00:19.084
isn't all hugs and celebrations.

00:00:19.084 --> 00:00:21.471
Long before epic fireworks displays,

00:00:21.471 --> 00:00:24.225
chemists in China invented the key ingredient

00:00:24.225 --> 00:00:27.432
that propels those bright lights into the sky.

00:00:27.432 --> 00:00:30.388
That invention was what we now call gunpowder.

00:00:30.388 --> 00:00:32.766
Our story begins back in ancient China

00:00:32.766 --> 00:00:34.342
in the mid-ninth century

00:00:34.342 --> 00:00:36.186
where early Chinese alchemists

00:00:36.186 --> 00:00:39.684
were trying to create a potion for immortality.

00:00:39.684 --> 00:00:42.733
Instead, what they created was a flammable powder

00:00:42.733 --> 00:00:45.159
that burned down many of their homes.

00:00:45.159 --> 00:00:47.740
They quickly realized that this black powder,

00:00:47.740 --> 00:00:49.277
which they called fire medicine,

00:00:49.277 --> 00:00:51.518
was precisely the opposite of something

00:00:51.518 --> 00:00:53.326
that would make you live forever.

00:00:53.326 --> 00:00:54.611
In these early days,

00:00:54.611 --> 00:00:56.573
the Chinese hadn't yet figured out

00:00:56.573 --> 00:00:58.508
how to make the powder explode;

00:00:58.508 --> 00:01:00.263
it was simply very flammable,

00:01:00.263 --> 00:01:01.518
and their armies used it

00:01:01.518 --> 00:01:02.845
to make flaming arrows

00:01:02.845 --> 00:01:04.384
and even a flamethrower.

00:01:04.384 --> 00:01:06.224
But once they figured out the right proportions

00:01:06.224 --> 00:01:08.391
of ingredients to create a blast,

00:01:08.391 --> 00:01:10.718
they began using the powder even more,

00:01:10.718 --> 00:01:13.510
creating fireworks to keep evil spirits away

00:01:13.510 --> 00:01:15.233
and bombs to defend themselves

00:01:15.233 --> 00:01:17.568
against Mongol invaders.

00:01:17.568 --> 00:01:19.769
It was these Mongols, most likely,

00:01:19.769 --> 00:01:21.573
who spread the invention of gunpowder

00:01:21.573 --> 00:01:22.981
across the world.

00:01:22.981 --> 00:01:25.098
After fielding Chinese attacks,

00:01:25.098 --> 00:01:27.352
they learned how to produce the powder themselves

00:01:27.352 --> 00:01:28.320
and brought it with them

00:01:28.320 --> 00:01:31.074
on their conquests in Persia and India.

00:01:31.074 --> 00:01:32.403
William of Rubruck,

00:01:32.403 --> 00:01:34.241
a European ambassador to the Mongols,

00:01:34.241 --> 00:01:36.550
was likely responsible for bringing gunpowder

00:01:36.550 --> 00:01:39.332
back to Europe around 1254.

00:01:39.332 --> 00:01:42.770
From there, engineers and military inventors

00:01:42.770 --> 00:01:44.498
created all kinds of destructive weapons.

00:01:44.498 --> 00:01:47.167
From bombs to guns to cannons,

00:01:47.167 --> 00:01:49.457
gunpowder left its mark on the world

00:01:49.457 --> 00:01:51.180
in some pretty terrible ways,

00:01:51.180 --> 00:01:52.986
in contrast to the beautiful marks

00:01:52.986 --> 00:01:54.754
it can leave in the air.

00:01:54.754 --> 00:01:56.254
So, how does black powder propel

00:01:56.254 --> 00:01:58.005
fireworks into the sky?

00:01:58.005 --> 00:02:00.588
You might have seen old Westerns or cartoons

00:02:00.588 --> 00:02:02.406
where a trail of gunpowder is lit

00:02:02.406 --> 00:02:05.646
and it leads to a large and obviously explosive barrel.

00:02:05.646 --> 00:02:07.418
Once the fire gets to the barrel,

00:02:07.418 --> 00:02:08.924
a large boom occurs.

00:02:08.924 --> 00:02:11.667
But why doesn't the trail itself explode?

00:02:11.667 --> 00:02:13.646
The reason is that burning the powder

00:02:13.646 --> 00:02:15.926
releases energy and gases.

00:02:15.926 --> 00:02:17.530
While the trail is burning,

00:02:17.530 --> 00:02:20.533
these are easily released into the surrounding air.

00:02:20.533 --> 00:02:21.563
But when the gunpowder

00:02:21.563 --> 00:02:23.417
is contained within the barrel,

00:02:23.417 --> 00:02:26.398
the energy and gases cannot easily escape

00:02:26.398 --> 00:02:27.983
and build up until

00:02:27.983 --> 00:02:29.048
BOOM!

00:02:29.632 --> 00:02:31.193
Firework canisters provide

00:02:31.193 --> 00:02:33.374
a single, upward-facing outlet

00:02:33.374 --> 00:02:35.666
to channel this explosive energy.

00:02:35.666 --> 00:02:37.376
The wick ignites the gunpowder

00:02:37.376 --> 00:02:38.333
and the energy takes

00:02:38.333 --> 00:02:40.288
the easiest exit from the canister,

00:02:40.288 --> 00:02:42.719
launching the firework high into the sky.

00:02:42.719 --> 00:02:44.058
The flame then makes its way

00:02:44.058 --> 00:02:45.675
through the firework's encasing

00:02:45.675 --> 00:02:47.176
and the same reaction occurs

00:02:47.176 --> 00:02:48.795
high above our heads.

00:02:48.795 --> 00:02:50.509
So, while the Chinese alchemists

00:02:50.509 --> 00:02:52.837
never found the compound for eternal life,

00:02:52.837 --> 00:02:54.005
they did find something

00:02:54.005 --> 00:02:56.503
that would go on to shape all of civilization,

00:02:56.503 --> 00:02:57.606
something that has caused

00:02:57.606 --> 00:02:59.592
many tragic moments in human history,

00:02:59.592 --> 00:03:01.559
and yet still gives us hope

00:03:01.559 --> 00:03:03.260
when we look up in celebration

00:03:03.260 --> 00:03:05.645
at the colorful night sky.
