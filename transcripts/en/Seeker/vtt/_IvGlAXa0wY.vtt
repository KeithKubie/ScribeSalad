00:00:00.080 --> 00:00:05.490
Under federal law abortion providers have
to tell women of the risks in the procedure,

00:00:05.490 --> 00:00:07.840
imagine if you had to do that to run a marathon?

00:00:07.840 --> 00:00:14.290
Just how dangerous are abortions?

00:00:14.290 --> 00:00:16.750
Howdy folks, Trace here for DNews.

00:00:16.750 --> 00:00:19.730
Abortion is something everyone talks about
but few people really understand.

00:00:19.730 --> 00:00:23.140
I did a video a while back about HOW they
work, so if you need to know -- check that

00:00:23.140 --> 00:00:24.140
out.

00:00:24.140 --> 00:00:27.890
Recently, the U.S. Supreme Court struck down
an law in Texas requiring doctors to have

00:00:27.890 --> 00:00:32.750
admitting privileges at a nearby hospital
because of the purported risks to the mother,

00:00:32.750 --> 00:00:35.470
but is abortion really that dangerous?

00:00:35.470 --> 00:00:39.930
Abortion isn't just one thing, it depends
on when in the gestation the pregnancy is

00:00:39.930 --> 00:00:40.930
terminated.

00:00:40.930 --> 00:00:45.570
As you probably know human gestation is broken
into three trimesters of about 12 to 14 weeks,

00:00:45.570 --> 00:00:50.300
and each trimester presents different risks
to the mother, but overall abortion is not

00:00:50.300 --> 00:00:51.300
risky.

00:00:51.300 --> 00:00:55.960
According to a study from Obstetrics and Gynecology
comparing risk of dying from abortion versus

00:00:55.960 --> 00:01:01.420
dying from giving birth found childbirth is
14.7-times more dangerous.

00:01:01.420 --> 00:01:06.360
The risk of death from abortion is about point-zero
zero zero seven percent.

00:01:06.360 --> 00:01:11.260
According to a study in the journal Contraception
this is similar to plastic surgery, dental

00:01:11.260 --> 00:01:15.330
procedures, or the number of running deaths
during marathons.

00:01:15.330 --> 00:01:20.750
Another study followed 54,000 women who had
abortions to track any post-abortion hospital

00:01:20.750 --> 00:01:26.160
visits, and found only zero-point-eight-seven
percent of women visited the ER within six

00:01:26.160 --> 00:01:27.690
weeks after the procedure.

00:01:27.690 --> 00:01:31.580
Which is great news, because half of all women
in the U.S., or roughly one out of every four

00:01:31.580 --> 00:01:34.570
people in this country, will have this procedure…!

00:01:34.570 --> 00:01:39.500
It's done so often that of 170,000 procedures
studied by the Journal of the American Board

00:01:39.500 --> 00:01:44.960
of Family Medicine only zero point eight five
percent of procedures: required "re-aspiration,"

00:01:44.960 --> 00:01:48.210
experienced a cervical tear, or got a mild
infection.

00:01:48.210 --> 00:01:52.510
None of those, by the way, require a hospital
to treat -- hospitalization incidence was

00:01:52.510 --> 00:01:54.760
only point zero seven percent.

00:01:54.760 --> 00:01:57.940
But there are different kinds of risks for
different procedures.

00:01:57.940 --> 00:02:03.440
Ninety-seven percent of abortions in the first
trimester are done using vacuum aspiration.

00:02:03.440 --> 00:02:06.409
Don't picture your floor vacuum at home, it's
not like that at all.

00:02:06.409 --> 00:02:09.259
Instead, picture a doctor pulling back on
a syringe.

00:02:09.259 --> 00:02:13.100
Of the remaining three percent, some are done
with drugs -- called a medical abortion.

00:02:13.100 --> 00:02:16.650
Basically, a pill tells the lining of the
uterus it's time to shed, and the fetus is

00:02:16.650 --> 00:02:17.870
carried along with it.

00:02:17.870 --> 00:02:22.220
With these the risks are mild, mainly infections,
bleeding, cramps, diarrhea, and such.

00:02:22.220 --> 00:02:26.970
But, there are also surgical abortions, where
dilation and evacuation takes place.

00:02:26.970 --> 00:02:31.870
These are usually done in the second trimester,
and the risks are greater, but still mild.

00:02:31.870 --> 00:02:36.130
Here, again, doctors are mostly concerned
about infections, perforating the uterus,

00:02:36.130 --> 00:02:40.020
or uncontrolled bleeding, all of which are
pretty rare.

00:02:40.020 --> 00:02:42.250
Abortions do carry a small risk for future
pregnancies.

00:02:42.250 --> 00:02:47.570
A 2003 study of thousands of women found there
was a slight miscarriage increase of around

00:02:47.570 --> 00:02:51.520
2 percent, but overall, the risk was incredibly
low.

00:02:51.520 --> 00:02:57.790
By comparison, smoking during pregnancy increases
the risk of miscarriage by 11 percent.

00:02:57.790 --> 00:03:01.380
The major problems abortion patients should
worry about is sepsis.

00:03:01.380 --> 00:03:05.430
Basically, the aspiration doesn't get all
the fetal and placental tissue, which may

00:03:05.430 --> 00:03:07.950
become infected as the immune system attacks
it.

00:03:07.950 --> 00:03:11.840
And if women have multiple abortions, the
risks of abnormal placental movement in future

00:03:11.840 --> 00:03:13.360
pregnancies increases.

00:03:13.360 --> 00:03:19.440
Although, remember, both of these fall under
the overall low risk of hospitalization and

00:03:19.440 --> 00:03:20.440
mortality.

00:03:20.440 --> 00:03:23.830
Each year in the U.S. at least 700,000 women
will seek an abortion.

00:03:23.830 --> 00:03:28.290
In a charged political climate, there will
always be a philosophical debate.

00:03:28.290 --> 00:03:33.190
But numerous scientific studies have proven
that the risk is low to the mother, as long

00:03:33.190 --> 00:03:48.230
as it’s done by 
a medical professional.

00:03:48.230 --> 00:03:58.940
I'm sure you're already leaving comments,
but if you haven't, go down there and tell

00:03:58.940 --> 00:04:02.290
me what you think.
