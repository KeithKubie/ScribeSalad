00:00:00.005 --> 00:00:05.480
5x- (7- 4x) simplifies to 9x- 7.

00:00:05.480 --> 00:00:08.470
This is a tricky one.

00:00:08.470 --> 00:00:13.939
In this problem it is very
helpful to rewrite 5x-

00:00:13.939 --> 00:00:20.230
(7- 4x) as 5x + (-1)(7 + (-4x)).

00:00:20.230 --> 00:00:22.340
I know this looks a little messy but

00:00:22.340 --> 00:00:25.330
this will help us keep track
of all the negative signs.

00:00:25.330 --> 00:00:30.321
So this (-1) needs to be distributed
to both terms inside the parentheses.

00:00:30.321 --> 00:00:38.134
And what we get is 5x
+ ((-1)7 + (-1)(-4x)).

00:00:38.134 --> 00:00:42.607
Simplifying further and removing
the outer parentheses because there's

00:00:42.607 --> 00:00:46.172
nothing left to distribute,
we get 5x + (-7) + 4x.

00:00:46.172 --> 00:00:49.910
Remember a negative times
a negative gives a positive.

00:00:50.970 --> 00:00:55.940
These are alike terms which
we can combine to get 9x.

00:00:55.940 --> 00:01:00.350
Then, since 7 can't combine with
anything else, we leave it how it is.

00:01:00.350 --> 00:01:03.504
And our answer is 9x- 7.
