00:00:08.820 --> 00:00:15.400
We've come to see living on our own or in a small family unit of our own as a key step in growing up;

00:00:15.400 --> 00:00:19.200
it's the dominant image we have of adult existence.

00:00:19.200 --> 00:00:26.160
So, monasticism, which involves unmarried people working and living together in highly organized communities,

00:00:26.160 --> 00:00:28.700
can seem very marginal and odd.

00:00:28.700 --> 00:00:34.020
We may not have anything particularly against monasticism, but it can seem just very unusual,

00:00:34.020 --> 00:00:39.840
something that might work for a very few individuals without being relevant to the lives of most people today.

00:00:39.840 --> 00:00:43.500
At its core, monasticism puts forward the bold thesis

00:00:43.500 --> 00:00:47.480
that people can actually lead the most fruitful, productive, and happy lives

00:00:47.480 --> 00:00:51.360
when they abandon the idea of coupledom and the single family dwelling,

00:00:51.360 --> 00:01:00.180
get together into controlled, very organized groups of friends, have some clear rules, and direct themselves towards a few big ambitions.

00:01:00.180 --> 00:01:05.940
The modern world insist that we'll always be happier in a small home, on our own or with one or two very special people,

00:01:05.940 --> 00:01:12.120
but this ideal can be deeply problematic, leaving us occasionally looking around for some sort of an alternative.

00:01:12.540 --> 00:01:17.160
Even if we're not planning on setting up a secular version of a monastery anytime soon,

00:01:17.160 --> 00:01:25.900
the history of monasticism deserves to be studied for the lessons it can yield about the limits to modern individualism.

00:01:25.900 --> 00:01:28.420
A site near Athens, 300 BC

00:01:28.420 --> 00:01:34.960
The philosopher, Epicurus, buys some land just outside the city of Athens and invites friends to come and live with him.

00:01:34.960 --> 00:01:39.080
It's the world's first proper commune based around philosophy.

00:01:39.080 --> 00:01:44.920
Epicurus has come to the view that we tend not to be very happy because we overrate the importance of three things:

00:01:44.920 --> 00:01:48.800
romantic love, having lots of money, and the enjoyment of luxury.

00:01:48.800 --> 00:01:57.220
The point of this commune is to help people avoid these mistakes and to focus instead on friendship, simple pleasures, and cultivating the mind.

00:01:57.220 --> 00:02:03.100
In the commune, everyone has a room and there are common areas downstairs and in the grounds. That way, the residents are

00:02:03.100 --> 00:02:07.520
always surrounded by people who share their outlooks, are entertaining and kind.

00:02:07.520 --> 00:02:12.760
Children are looked after in Rota, everyone eats together, one can chat in the corridors late at night.

00:02:13.400 --> 00:02:18.400
It's a very succesful arrangement and a great many other epicurean communities are founded.

00:02:18.400 --> 00:02:21.480
The movement flourishes for almost 400 years.

00:02:21.720 --> 00:02:25.180
The big move that Epicurus makes is that people should live together

00:02:25.180 --> 00:02:30.280
not because they happen to be related by family ties, or were born in the same geographical region

00:02:30.540 --> 00:02:33.900
They should do so because they share values and ideals.

00:02:33.900 --> 00:02:40.200
Epicurus proposes that we need the presence and assistance of like-minded people able to free ourselves

00:02:40.200 --> 00:02:45.400
from the usual social preoccupations and get on with the sincere tasks of our lives.

00:02:47.800 --> 00:02:50.340
Monte Cassino, Italy, 529 AD,

00:02:50.640 --> 00:02:54.340
Inspired by the example of Epicurus, Saint Benedict establishes

00:02:54.340 --> 00:02:57.460
his first monastery halfway between Rome and Naples.

00:02:57.460 --> 00:03:03.300
It's still there, although it had to be heavily rebuilt after it was damaged by allied bombing in 1944.

00:03:03.300 --> 00:03:08.140
Benedict writes an instruction manual for his followers with a simple and emphatic title,

00:03:08.320 --> 00:03:09.540
"The Rule."

00:03:09.540 --> 00:03:14.440
In his book, Benedict lays out strict regulations about how to run a monastery; he details:

00:03:14.440 --> 00:03:20.100
what to eat, when it's OK to talk and when you have to be silent, who has to do the cooking, washing up and gardening

00:03:20.100 --> 00:03:24.840
Everyone has to take turns: when to go to bed and went to get up, what sorts of clothes to wear

00:03:24.840 --> 00:03:26.660
and what kind of haircut to have.

00:03:26.660 --> 00:03:33.200
The list can seem like a huge denial of individual liberty, but Benedict's contributions to the history of monasticism

00:03:33.200 --> 00:03:40.740
is his faith in the benefit of extensive, explicit and detailed rules to which members voluntarily agree.

00:03:41.020 --> 00:03:46.620
Benedict believes that only under regulated conditions can the best potential of people be harnessed.

00:03:46.620 --> 00:03:51.920
He works on the idea that although high level of personal freedom sounds like a lovely idea,

00:03:51.980 --> 00:03:55.440
it's not in fact an optimum condition for most of us

00:03:55.440 --> 00:04:00.100
because we have a fatal tendency to veer towards dissipation, distraction,

00:04:00.100 --> 00:04:01.660
and wasting our time.

00:04:02.760 --> 00:04:05.080
North Yorkshire, England, 657 AD;

00:04:05.280 --> 00:04:09.920
St. Hilda of Whitby, one of the most powerful and accomplished women in the early history of England,

00:04:10.180 --> 00:04:11.540
founds a monestary.

00:04:11.540 --> 00:04:16.200
In her role as the head of the monastery of Whitby, she becomes a very senior administrator,

00:04:16.280 --> 00:04:18.600
runs a large cultural enterprise,

00:04:18.600 --> 00:04:21.780
is a management consultant to visiting kings and princes,

00:04:21.780 --> 00:04:24.860
and has an impact as a leading educationalist.

00:04:24.860 --> 00:04:27.440
And she does all this while being noted for her good temper.

00:04:27.440 --> 00:04:29.180
Of course, she's unmarried.

00:04:29.620 --> 00:04:31.280
It's not that because she's a nun,

00:04:31.280 --> 00:04:32.880
she isn't allowed to get married,

00:04:32.880 --> 00:04:36.980
and so has to make the best of her work opportunities without a supportive home-life--

00:04:36.980 --> 00:04:39.520
the line of thought runs the other way around.

00:04:39.520 --> 00:04:43.740
She's able to have a stellar career and achieve so much for the community

00:04:43.740 --> 00:04:47.500
because she's free of the demands of relationships and domestic life.

00:04:47.600 --> 00:04:51.100
Being a nun means she's supplied with meals, laundry, and heating

00:04:51.100 --> 00:04:53.340
without having to organize everything for herself.

00:04:53.380 --> 00:04:55.940
She can be astonishingly productive.

00:04:56.120 --> 00:04:59.300
We tend to associate monastic life with religious devotion,

00:04:59.300 --> 00:05:02.860
but people like Hilda suggest that there are many benefits of monasteries,

00:05:02.860 --> 00:05:05.620
which are not really tied to religion at all.

00:05:05.620 --> 00:05:10.660
Most crucially, the monastery removes the problem of finding a work-life balance.

00:05:10.660 --> 00:05:14.260
Within the monastery, work and life are not really two separate things--

00:05:14.260 --> 00:05:15.780
you're always at work.

00:05:16.120 --> 00:05:18.920
It's an attitude summed up by the followers of Saint Benedict

00:05:18.920 --> 00:05:20.460
in one of their key mottoes,

00:05:20.480 --> 00:05:22.440
"Laborare est orare:

00:05:22.440 --> 00:05:23.720
to work is to pray."

00:05:24.160 --> 00:05:26.480
That is, what you're doing when you're digging the fields,

00:05:26.480 --> 00:05:30.560
administering the accounts, deliberating policy, or involved in contemplation

00:05:30.580 --> 00:05:33.920
are not opposed activities to be weighed up against each other.

00:05:33.920 --> 00:05:40.100
You can fully immerse yourself in your work, which when it's meaningful, can be the highest of pleasures.

00:05:43.100 --> 00:05:45.340
Kingdom of Bhutan, 1692:

00:05:45.340 --> 00:05:49.460
the establishment of the Takstang Palphug Buddhist monastery.

00:05:49.460 --> 00:05:53.660
Like Christianity, Buddhism has a long standing interest in communal living.

00:05:53.920 --> 00:05:57.700
The lofty and rather inaccessible location isn't an accident.

00:05:57.760 --> 00:05:59.460
The point of going to a monastery

00:05:59.460 --> 00:06:04.220
is to avoid the distractions that might take one's attention away from what's really important.

00:06:04.520 --> 00:06:08.000
The Buddhists are acutely aware of the problems of distraction;

00:06:08.000 --> 00:06:10.340
what they call, "The Monkey Mind."

00:06:10.720 --> 00:06:13.500
This is one of the recurrent themes around monasteries,

00:06:13.500 --> 00:06:19.240
so locating the monastery far away from the city, and in a setting where nature appears at its most impressive,

00:06:19.240 --> 00:06:21.360
is a careful, strategic ploy.

00:06:21.360 --> 00:06:26.600
It's using geography and architecture in a struggle to get us to focus on the right things.

00:06:27.260 --> 00:06:31.300
Monasticism knows that human beings are pathetically prone to distraction.

00:06:31.380 --> 00:06:35.700
It's almost comically easy to get us to stop concentrating on anything serious,

00:06:35.700 --> 00:06:37.680
or even a tiny bit challenging.

00:06:37.960 --> 00:06:43.560
But collectively, we've been very reluctant to take serious steps to address this mania for distraction.

00:06:43.560 --> 00:06:49.220
It's almost shocking to imagine what one might be able to do where our attention's not always wandering off.

00:06:49.280 --> 00:06:54.740
Buddhism's leading figures are prepared to accept that asking for prolonged, non-distracted attention

00:06:54.820 --> 00:06:57.600
means making huge and specific adjustments.

00:06:57.780 --> 00:06:59.320
That's what monasticism is for.

00:07:00.160 --> 00:07:03.140
Trinity college, Cambridge, England, October 1911.

00:07:03.380 --> 00:07:07.920
The philosopher, Ludwig Littgenstein, enrolls as a student at Trinity College, Cambridge

00:07:07.920 --> 00:07:11.140
to study under the great and eminent professor, Bertrand Russell.

00:07:11.500 --> 00:07:17.560
Trinity College is, like most of the Oxford and Cambridge colleges, founded on the plan of a medieval monastery.

00:07:17.840 --> 00:07:20.500
It isn't centered around a relationship with God,

00:07:20.500 --> 00:07:22.220
but it does have a belief system.

00:07:22.260 --> 00:07:25.520
One focused on the idea of academic work.

00:07:25.720 --> 00:07:27.480
Fellows of the college, such as Russell,

00:07:27.480 --> 00:07:32.340
lived a communal life and they have to be unmarried in order to admitted inside the community;

00:07:32.340 --> 00:07:34.840
married academics lived elsewhere in Cambridge.

00:07:34.920 --> 00:07:36.540
The arrangements are an admission

00:07:36.540 --> 00:07:40.300
that certain kinds of jobs, especially intellectual and creative ones,

00:07:40.300 --> 00:07:43.380
are not well-aligned with the demands of family life

00:07:43.380 --> 00:07:45.380
or even of running your own household.

00:07:45.980 --> 00:07:49.240
This academic monastery means you can socialize mainly with people

00:07:49.240 --> 00:07:51.540
who are involved in the same kind of work as you--

00:07:51.540 --> 00:07:53.560
who can offer you sympathy, help and advice

00:07:53.560 --> 00:07:55.400
and will never nag you about the laundry.

00:07:55.940 --> 00:07:59.780
The sneaking suspicion that someone who does your job might be harming their talents

00:07:59.780 --> 00:08:04.420
by emptying the bins or making the beds might, the college system argues, just be true.

00:08:04.800 --> 00:08:08.860
Russell and Wittgenstein weld together revolutionized 20th century philosophy.

00:08:09.780 --> 00:08:11.620
San Francisco, 1966.

00:08:11.700 --> 00:08:15.320
The first hippy communes spring up in the Haight-Ashbury district of the city.

00:08:15.600 --> 00:08:19.360
The hippies go in for a very particular style of communal living, involving:

00:08:19.360 --> 00:08:26.600
beards, lentils, chanting, free-wheeling attitudes to sex, suspicion of technology, and dislike of tidiness.

00:08:26.700 --> 00:08:30.120
They so gripped the public imagination that their way of doing things

00:08:30.120 --> 00:08:33.040
becomes what living together looks like to most people

00:08:33.040 --> 00:08:36.020
when they think of what it might mean to live in a commune.

00:08:36.100 --> 00:08:38.040
Almost by chance, it comes to seem as if

00:08:38.100 --> 00:08:43.460
being interested in shared property, collective responsibility, and mutual assistance with your work

00:08:43.460 --> 00:08:48.880
means you also have to be interested in dancing naked and sitting cross-legged on the floor with large a beard.

00:08:49.000 --> 00:08:54.120
It hence becomes hard to imagine a secular monastery with non-hippy values.

00:08:54.440 --> 00:08:58.340
For example, a commune devoted to entrepreneurship, traditional manners,

00:08:58.340 --> 00:09:02.800
or a strong enthusiasm for clean design and modernist architecture.

00:09:03.400 --> 00:09:06.660
Many options for communal living still lie before us.

00:09:06.660 --> 00:09:09.940
Monasteries and communes have not exhausted the possibilities,

00:09:09.940 --> 00:09:14.160
even if their examples can act as sources of ongoing inspiration.

00:09:14.200 --> 00:09:17.960
When we try to live together with just one special other person,

00:09:17.960 --> 00:09:20.080
the experiment often runs aground.

00:09:20.080 --> 00:09:23.040
We get bored, sexually frustrated or constrained.

00:09:23.040 --> 00:09:25.180
We often blame the other person for this,

00:09:25.180 --> 00:09:28.360
and rush off to repeat the experiment with someone else.

00:09:28.640 --> 00:09:32.100
We'd be wise to see that the institution of romantic marriage

00:09:32.100 --> 00:09:35.960
can place some intolerable burdens on otherwise very good people,

00:09:35.960 --> 00:09:41.400
who would hugely benefit from other ways of structuring their time and their laundry responsibilities.

00:09:41.480 --> 00:09:45.560
As an alternative to the dispiriting domestic bickering of certain couples,

00:09:45.560 --> 00:09:52.200
it may be time to revisit the fascinating examples of early modes of monastic and communal life.
