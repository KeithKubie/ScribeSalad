00:00:00.450 --> 00:00:03.360
The next step now, is to have
a way to turn off the recording

00:00:03.360 --> 00:00:05.500
once you've started recording something.

00:00:05.500 --> 00:00:07.590
For that, we will need, you guessed it.

00:00:07.590 --> 00:00:08.750
Our stop recording button.

00:00:10.150 --> 00:00:13.170
We'll also need an IP-action
from the stop recording button

00:00:13.170 --> 00:00:15.000
to the view controller code.

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:18.130
Make sure you are on the assistant
view with the storyboard and

00:00:18.130 --> 00:00:20.500
the view controller files open.

00:00:20.500 --> 00:00:23.850
Control drag from this button
into the view controller and

00:00:23.850 --> 00:00:25.770
select the option to
create an IB action.

00:00:27.020 --> 00:00:29.140
Let's name this IB action
stopped recording.

00:00:30.790 --> 00:00:34.850
In this action, let's add a line to
print out when this button was pressed

00:00:34.850 --> 00:00:36.160
by adding the following code.

00:00:37.370 --> 00:00:39.450
We should be able to run
the pitch perfect app now.

00:00:39.450 --> 00:00:41.780
And if we press the stop
recording button,

00:00:41.780 --> 00:00:45.570
we'll see our caveman debugging
output in the Xcode console.

00:00:45.570 --> 00:00:46.180
Let's give it a try.

00:00:47.290 --> 00:00:48.110
We're almost there.

00:00:48.110 --> 00:00:51.560
The next step is to add the constraints
to our new label and button and

00:00:51.560 --> 00:00:54.960
then to wire up some IBoutlets so
that the Recording and

00:00:54.960 --> 00:00:58.310
Stop Recording buttons are not
both enabled at the same time.
