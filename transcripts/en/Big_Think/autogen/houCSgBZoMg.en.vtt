a scientific way of thinking so why
aren't scientists doing this because

00:00:13.869 --> 00:00:13.879
aren't scientists doing this because
 

00:00:13.879 --> 00:00:15.609
aren't scientists doing this because
they're busy doing their own thing in

there's a whole hundreds and hundreds of

00:00:42.400 --> 00:00:42.410
there's a whole hundreds and hundreds of
 

00:00:42.410 --> 00:00:45.430

these claims that are all connected to

00:00:45.430 --> 00:00:45.440
these claims that are all connected to
 

00:00:45.440 --> 00:00:48.340
these claims that are all connected to
different Sciences but the scientists in

00:00:48.340 --> 00:00:48.350
different Sciences but the scientists in
 

00:00:48.350 --> 00:00:50.130
different Sciences but the scientists in
those particular fields are too busy

00:00:50.130 --> 00:00:50.140
those particular fields are too busy
 

00:00:50.140 --> 00:00:53.860
those particular fields are too busy
working in their research to bother with

00:00:53.860 --> 00:00:53.870
working in their research to bother with
 

00:00:53.870 --> 00:00:55.180
working in their research to bother with
what these claims are because the claims

00:00:55.180 --> 00:00:55.190
what these claims are because the claims
 

00:00:55.190 --> 00:00:57.010
what these claims are because the claims
really aren't about those fields they're

00:00:57.010 --> 00:00:57.020
really aren't about those fields they're
 

00:00:57.020 --> 00:00:58.780
really aren't about those fields they're
just hooked to them they're about

00:00:58.780 --> 00:00:58.790
just hooked to them they're about
 

00:00:58.790 --> 00:01:01.000
just hooked to them they're about
something else because like back in the

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:01.010
something else because like back in the
 

00:01:01.010 --> 00:01:03.010
something else because like back in the

earth creationists you know they did not
 

00:01:07.490 --> 00:01:09.789
earth creationists you know they did not
fare well and I saw some Holocaust

00:01:09.789 --> 00:01:09.799
fare well and I saw some Holocaust
 

00:01:09.799 --> 00:01:12.280

deniers they did not fare well because

00:01:16.840 --> 00:01:16.850
deniers they did not fare well because
 

00:01:16.850 --> 00:01:18.730
deniers they did not fare well because
they didn't know the special arguments

00:01:18.730 --> 00:01:18.740
they didn't know the special arguments
 

00:01:18.740 --> 00:01:20.620
they didn't know the special arguments
that are being made by these fringe

00:01:20.620 --> 00:01:20.630
that are being made by these fringe
 

00:01:20.630 --> 00:01:22.660

people that have nothing to do with the

00:01:22.660 --> 00:01:22.670
people that have nothing to do with the
 

00:01:22.670 --> 00:01:24.399
people that have nothing to do with the
science really they have an agenda and

00:01:24.399 --> 00:01:24.409
science really they have an agenda and
 

00:01:24.409 --> 00:01:26.080
science really they have an agenda and
they're using these little tweak

00:01:26.080 --> 00:01:26.090
they're using these little tweak
 

00:01:26.090 --> 00:01:29.920
they're using these little tweak
questions to get at it the mainstream

00:01:29.920 --> 00:01:29.930
questions to get at it the mainstream
 

00:01:29.930 --> 00:01:31.120
questions to get at it the mainstream
and try to debunk it for their own

00:01:31.120 --> 00:01:31.130
and try to debunk it for their own
 

00:01:31.130 --> 00:01:33.250
and try to debunk it for their own
ideological reasons so for example like

00:01:33.250 --> 00:01:33.260
ideological reasons so for example like
 

00:01:33.260 --> 00:01:35.380
ideological reasons so for example like
Holocaust revisionists I make this big

00:01:35.380 --> 00:01:35.390
Holocaust revisionists I make this big
 

00:01:35.390 --> 00:01:38.140

deal about why the door on the gas

00:01:38.140 --> 00:01:38.150
deal about why the door on the gas

chamber at madhouse and doesn't lock I

00:01:40.240 --> 00:01:40.250
chamber at madhouse and doesn't lock I
 

00:01:40.250 --> 00:01:41.890
chamber at madhouse and doesn't lock I
mean if it doesn't lock how are you

00:01:41.890 --> 00:01:41.900
mean if it doesn't lock how are you
 

00:01:41.900 --> 00:01:43.240
mean if it doesn't lock how are you
gassing people if you can't lock the

00:01:43.240 --> 00:01:43.250
gassing people if you can't lock the
 

00:01:43.250 --> 00:01:45.100
gassing people if you can't lock the
door you know so they must not a gas

00:01:45.100 --> 00:01:45.110
door you know so they must not a gas
 

00:01:45.110 --> 00:01:46.390
door you know so they must not a gas
people in there so if they didn't gas

00:01:46.390 --> 00:01:46.400
people in there so if they didn't gas
 

00:01:46.400 --> 00:01:47.620
people in there so if they didn't gas
people at Matt house and they probably

00:01:47.620 --> 00:01:47.630
people at Matt house and they probably
 

00:01:47.630 --> 00:01:49.060
people at Matt house and they probably
didn't gas people at any of the death

00:01:49.060 --> 00:01:49.070
didn't gas people at any of the death
 

00:01:49.070 --> 00:01:50.560
didn't gas people at any of the death
camps and if they didn't gas people

00:01:50.560 --> 00:01:50.570
camps and if they didn't gas people
 

00:01:50.570 --> 00:01:52.420
camps and if they didn't gas people
attending the death camps then they must

00:01:52.420 --> 00:01:52.430
attending the death camps then they must
 

00:01:52.430 --> 00:01:54.700
attending the death camps then they must
not have been a Holocaust what wait a

00:01:54.700 --> 00:01:54.710
not have been a Holocaust what wait a
 

00:01:54.710 --> 00:01:56.890
not have been a Holocaust what wait a
minute what yeah well from this door

00:01:56.890 --> 00:01:56.900
minute what yeah well from this door
 

00:01:56.900 --> 00:01:58.480
minute what yeah well from this door
that doesn't lock well I eventually went

00:01:58.480 --> 00:01:58.490
that doesn't lock well I eventually went
 

00:01:58.490 --> 00:01:59.740
that doesn't lock well I eventually went
and found out that that wasn't the

00:01:59.740 --> 00:01:59.750
and found out that that wasn't the
 

00:01:59.750 --> 00:02:01.060
and found out that that wasn't the
original door that took me a couple

00:02:01.060 --> 00:02:01.070
original door that took me a couple
 

00:02:01.070 --> 00:02:03.069
original door that took me a couple
years that's the kind of specialty thing

00:02:03.069 --> 00:02:03.079
years that's the kind of specialty thing
 

00:02:03.079 --> 00:02:05.469
years that's the kind of specialty thing
that skeptics do that mainstream

00:02:05.469 --> 00:02:05.479
that skeptics do that mainstream
 

00:02:05.479 --> 00:02:07.120
that skeptics do that mainstream
scientists scholars historians don't

00:02:07.120 --> 00:02:07.130
scientists scholars historians don't
 

00:02:07.130 --> 00:02:11.410
scientists scholars historians don't
have time to do so over the 25 years not

00:02:11.410 --> 00:02:11.420
have time to do so over the 25 years not
 

00:02:11.420 --> 00:02:13.300
have time to do so over the 25 years not
just us there's other skeptic magazines

00:02:13.300 --> 00:02:13.310
just us there's other skeptic magazines
 

00:02:13.310 --> 00:02:15.220
just us there's other skeptic magazines
and conferences and

00:02:15.220 --> 00:02:15.230
and conferences and
 

00:02:15.230 --> 00:02:17.199
and conferences and
you know and groups of people that meet

00:02:17.199 --> 00:02:17.209

and it's because we've because of

00:02:22.720 --> 00:02:22.730
and it's because we've because of
 

00:02:22.730 --> 00:02:24.520
and it's because we've because of
the internet especially this whole idea

00:02:24.520 --> 00:02:24.530
the internet especially this whole idea
 

00:02:24.530 --> 00:02:26.020
the internet especially this whole idea
of what we now call fake news

00:02:26.020 --> 00:02:26.030
of what we now call fake news
 

00:02:26.030 --> 00:02:27.670
of what we now call fake news
alternative facts has gotten bigger and

00:02:27.670 --> 00:02:27.680
alternative facts has gotten bigger and
 

00:02:27.680 --> 00:02:30.369
alternative facts has gotten bigger and
bigger and it just gets unfolded in real

00:02:30.369 --> 00:02:30.379
bigger and it just gets unfolded in real
 

00:02:30.379 --> 00:02:32.530
bigger and it just gets unfolded in real
time online within minutes and hours and

time online within minutes and hours and
 

00:02:32.540 --> 00:02:35.140
time online within minutes and hours and
we have to jump on it fast and so that's

00:02:35.140 --> 00:02:35.150
we have to jump on it fast and so that's
 

00:02:35.150 --> 00:02:36.910
we have to jump on it fast and so that's
really in part what we do so that's what

00:02:36.910 --> 00:02:36.920
really in part what we do so that's what
 

00:02:36.920 --> 00:02:38.559
really in part what we do so that's what
we've been doing for 25 years is kind of

00:02:38.559 --> 00:02:38.569
we've been doing for 25 years is kind of
 

00:02:38.569 --> 00:02:40.180
we've been doing for 25 years is kind of
putting out brushfires here and there

00:02:40.180 --> 00:02:40.190
putting out brushfires here and there
 

00:02:40.190 --> 00:02:43.059
putting out brushfires here and there
but also developing a set of tools that

00:02:43.059 --> 00:02:43.069
but also developing a set of tools that
 

00:02:43.069 --> 00:02:46.059
but also developing a set of tools that
can apply to any future ideas because I

00:02:46.059 --> 00:02:46.069
can apply to any future ideas because I
 

00:02:46.069 --> 00:02:47.410
can apply to any future ideas because I
don't know what's gonna be popular in

don't know what's gonna be popular in
 

00:02:47.420 --> 00:02:48.789
don't know what's gonna be popular in
five years from now heck I don't know

00:02:48.789 --> 00:02:48.799
five years from now heck I don't know

five years from now heck I don't know
what's gonna be trending tomorrow you

00:02:52.030 --> 00:02:52.040
what's gonna be trending tomorrow you
 

00:02:52.040 --> 00:02:53.680
what's gonna be trending tomorrow you
know who knows so you got to have these

00:02:53.680 --> 00:02:53.690
know who knows so you got to have these
 

00:02:53.690 --> 00:02:55.150
know who knows so you got to have these
tools at the ready and that's what we've

00:02:55.150 --> 00:02:55.160
tools at the ready and that's what we've
 

00:02:55.160 --> 00:02:57.729
tools at the ready and that's what we've
been doing at skeptic magazine but let's

00:02:57.729 --> 00:02:57.739
been doing at skeptic magazine but let's
 

00:02:57.739 --> 00:02:59.559
been doing at skeptic magazine but let's
address let's address the college campus

00:02:59.559 --> 00:02:59.569
address let's address the college campus
 

00:02:59.569 --> 00:03:01.599
address let's address the college campus
issue these days okay I I really think

00:03:01.599 --> 00:03:01.609
issue these days okay I I really think
 

00:03:01.609 --> 00:03:05.110

this goes back to the 1980s I noticed at

00:03:05.110 --> 00:03:05.120
this goes back to the 1980s I noticed at
 

00:03:05.120 --> 00:03:07.330
this goes back to the 1980s I noticed at
first when I was in graduate school the

00:03:07.330 --> 00:03:07.340
first when I was in graduate school the
 

00:03:07.340 --> 00:03:09.460
first when I was in graduate school the
second time when I got a PhD in the

00:03:09.460 --> 00:03:09.470
second time when I got a PhD in the
 

00:03:09.470 --> 00:03:12.009
second time when I got a PhD in the
history of science my first round was in

00:03:12.009 --> 00:03:12.019
history of science my first round was in
 

00:03:12.019 --> 00:03:14.500
history of science my first round was in
the 70s in experimental psychology

00:03:14.500 --> 00:03:14.510
the 70s in experimental psychology
 

00:03:14.510 --> 00:03:16.660
the 70s in experimental psychology
graduate school and I didn't notice any

really taking off and so I initially

00:03:34.270 --> 00:03:34.280
really taking off and so I initially
 

00:03:34.280 --> 00:03:36.220
really taking off and so I initially
thought what is this you know but okay

00:03:36.220 --> 00:03:36.230
thought what is this you know but okay
 

00:03:36.230 --> 00:03:37.300

I'll give it a shot

00:03:37.300 --> 00:03:37.310
I'll give it a shot
 

00:03:37.310 --> 00:03:38.740
I'll give it a shot
I'll keep an open mind here and just try

00:03:38.740 --> 00:03:38.750
I'll keep an open mind here and just try
 

00:03:38.750 --> 00:03:40.750
I'll keep an open mind here and just try
to follow the reasoning and I can kind

00:03:40.750 --> 00:03:40.760
to follow the reasoning and I can kind
 

00:03:40.760 --> 00:03:41.890
to follow the reasoning and I can kind
of see where they were going okay so

00:03:41.890 --> 00:03:41.900

that author and I can see that there may
not be one meaning you know maybe the

00:03:55.539 --> 00:03:55.549

completely to history and you can see

this is one of the earliest things we
started going after because it was

started going after because it was
 

00:06:03.340 --> 00:06:05.070
