00:00:00.060 --> 00:00:01.960
So, it was my birthday last Monday,

00:00:01.960 --> 00:00:02.660
woohoo!

00:00:02.680 --> 00:00:04.640
And, am I the only one that does this,

00:00:04.740 --> 00:00:06.220
but whenever it's my birthday,

00:00:06.320 --> 00:00:08.640
I sort of expect everyone to become

00:00:08.640 --> 00:00:10.180
my personal slave.

00:00:10.380 --> 00:00:11.480
Can you get my cell phone?

00:00:11.480 --> 00:00:12.920
The cell phone that's...

00:00:13.280 --> 00:00:14.940
right next to your hand?

00:00:15.420 --> 00:00:16.940
But it's my birthday.

00:00:16.940 --> 00:00:19.060
And it's not just small things like that,

00:00:19.060 --> 00:00:19.520
like,

00:00:19.520 --> 00:00:21.240
when it is my birthday...

00:00:21.820 --> 00:00:22.700
I become...

00:00:22.980 --> 00:00:23.760
a queen.

00:00:24.020 --> 00:00:25.280
(British accent) Good morrow!

00:00:25.280 --> 00:00:27.640
I beckon thee to my quarters.

00:00:28.100 --> 00:00:28.820
Anna...

00:00:28.980 --> 00:00:30.580
My fast of break shall be

00:00:30.580 --> 00:00:32.500
bacon and eggs.

00:00:33.240 --> 00:00:34.180
Make them green.

00:00:34.180 --> 00:00:36.120
It's like 11:59 right now.

00:00:36.120 --> 00:00:37.395
I'm not coming over

00:00:37.395 --> 00:00:38.755
and making you breakfast.

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:41.540
It is my birthday, for minutes more,

00:00:41.540 --> 00:00:45.200
and I demand birthday service!

00:00:46.980 --> 00:00:48.560
Your accents suck.

00:00:48.640 --> 00:00:50.420
I use the birthday excuse

00:00:50.420 --> 00:00:52.820
when it's not even my birthday anymore.

00:00:52.820 --> 00:00:54.880
But it was my birthday yesterday...

00:00:54.960 --> 00:00:57.060
But it's my birthday tomorrow...

00:00:57.100 --> 00:01:00.600
But my birthday only happens once every 365 days

00:01:00.600 --> 00:01:02.320
and even though today is not that day

00:01:02.320 --> 00:01:04.800
who's to say that I don't deserve to be treated that way

00:01:05.120 --> 00:01:06.900
for my non-birthday?

00:01:07.720 --> 00:01:08.640
Funny story,

00:01:08.640 --> 00:01:11.440
My parents got me this director's chair for my birthday.

00:01:11.440 --> 00:01:14.820
It had my name on one side and 
the Batman symbol on the other,

00:01:14.820 --> 00:01:17.000
and I loved it so much, thank you Mom and Dad.

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:17.980
I Instagrammed it,

00:01:18.220 --> 00:01:20.840
and one of my best friends of like 10 years, Gaby,

00:01:20.840 --> 00:01:22.580
texted me, and she was like,

00:01:22.580 --> 00:01:23.440
"Hey...

00:01:23.680 --> 00:01:26.900
I love your parents and everything, but uh...

00:01:27.040 --> 00:01:27.640
that's...

00:01:27.660 --> 00:01:29.320
the same exact thing...

00:01:29.320 --> 00:01:31.480
that I got you for your birthday too."

00:01:31.500 --> 00:01:33.800
And she was so disappointed

00:01:33.800 --> 00:01:36.260
cause it..she felt like they stole her thunder,

00:01:36.560 --> 00:01:38.953
but, I thought it was really awesome because

00:01:38.953 --> 00:01:42.293
that was kind of... the best gift... ever...

00:01:42.440 --> 00:01:45.360
the fact that the closest people to me

00:01:45.480 --> 00:01:46.980
thought to get me something like that

00:01:47.140 --> 00:01:48.340
kind of like, was like,

00:01:48.480 --> 00:01:51.160
"Ooh, okay. I'm a director now. Yay!"

00:01:51.420 --> 00:01:53.100
And I just--I'd--I really loved it.

00:01:53.100 --> 00:01:54.620
And also, the story was funny,

00:01:54.620 --> 00:01:55.960
and now I get 2 chairs.

00:01:56.100 --> 00:01:58.480
Which is fuckin' awesome for everyone 
who comes to my house.

00:01:58.480 --> 00:02:00.440
Really quick, before I thank today's sponsor,

00:02:00.561 --> 00:02:03.241
I am selling signed posters of my short films

00:02:03.241 --> 00:02:05.360
on ghostandstars.com,

00:02:05.369 --> 00:02:08.529
which is where I'm gonna launch 
my clothing line in a few months, woo~

00:02:08.529 --> 00:02:10.549
but yeah, if you wanna support my narrative work,

00:02:10.549 --> 00:02:12.249
then I'd love for you to buy a poster.

00:02:12.249 --> 00:02:13.849
And obviously you don't have to,

00:02:13.849 --> 00:02:16.629
but, I mean, you probably would want to,

00:02:16.629 --> 00:02:18.329
because then you could frame me,

00:02:18.480 --> 00:02:20.120
and put me in your room,

00:02:20.360 --> 00:02:21.700
so that I can watch you

00:02:21.740 --> 00:02:22.780
endlessly,

00:02:23.020 --> 00:02:25.140
as you make love to your significant other,

00:02:25.640 --> 00:02:28.840
as you cry into the pillows when 
he or she breaks your heart,

00:02:29.060 --> 00:02:31.540
while you work and walk to and fro,

00:02:31.680 --> 00:02:32.560
I'll be there.

00:02:32.820 --> 00:02:34.040
Consoling you

00:02:34.280 --> 00:02:35.980
with my endless stare.

00:02:36.500 --> 00:02:37.320
Watching.

00:02:37.680 --> 00:02:38.360
Waiting.

00:02:38.860 --> 00:02:40.940
Experiencing your life with you.

00:02:41.620 --> 00:02:42.480
Forever.

00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:44.760
Every poster comes with that guaranteed.

00:02:44.760 --> 00:02:45.500
(snickers)

00:02:45.500 --> 00:02:48.380
I'd like to thank Zulily for sponsoring today's episode,

00:02:48.591 --> 00:02:52.391

top quality brands to its members.

00:02:52.420 --> 00:02:55.920

00:02:55.920 --> 00:02:58.400

They curate collections and make 
online shopping fun and interesante~

00:03:02.800 --> 00:03:06.160
You can also favorite certain brands to 
get a reminder for when they go on sale.

00:03:06.200 --> 00:03:09.120
I love the names that they use to classify clothing, like,

00:03:09.120 --> 00:03:12.640
"European Touch: Sophisticated Apparel."

00:03:12.640 --> 00:03:14.840
I was like, "That's everything that I want to be.

00:03:14.840 --> 00:03:18.040
I want to be European and 
sophisticated and wear apparel."

00:03:18.040 --> 00:03:19.500

00:03:29.480 --> 00:03:32.100
Happy birthday to me, bitches!

00:03:32.621 --> 00:03:33.167
Woo!

00:03:33.820 --> 00:03:35.200
It's not narcissistic

00:03:35.280 --> 00:03:37.260
when you have a lot of self loathing

00:03:37.260 --> 00:03:38.380
and you just wanna

00:03:38.380 --> 00:03:40.680
be reminded of your accomplishments.

00:03:41.420 --> 00:03:42.100
Yeah.

00:03:43.860 --> 00:03:44.880
I love you, baby.

00:03:46.440 --> 00:03:47.400
Self love.

00:03:48.220 --> 00:03:49.240
(snickers)

00:03:49.240 --> 00:03:49.740
Little fuck..
