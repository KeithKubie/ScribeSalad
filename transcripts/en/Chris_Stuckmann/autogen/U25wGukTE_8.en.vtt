your friends in this virtual world so
apparently the plot of the game is

00:01:32.559 --> 00:01:32.569
apparently the plot of the game is
 

00:01:32.569 --> 00:01:34.929
apparently the plot of the game is
essentially Lex Luthor made a virtual

00:01:34.929 --> 00:01:34.939
essentially Lex Luthor made a virtual
 

00:01:34.939 --> 00:01:39.340

00:01:46.130 --> 00:01:48.489
it's a virtual world all Superman gets
to do in this virtual world is fly

00:01:48.489 --> 00:01:48.499
to do in this virtual world is fly
 

00:01:48.499 --> 00:01:51.569
to do in this virtual world is fly
through a horrendous amount of rings and

00:01:51.569 --> 00:01:51.579
through a horrendous amount of rings and
 

00:01:51.579 --> 00:01:55.510
through a horrendous amount of rings and
you got me as to why tightest software I

00:01:55.510 --> 00:01:55.520
you got me as to why tightest software I
 

00:01:55.520 --> 00:01:58.629
you got me as to why tightest software I
thought this would be a good idea but

00:01:58.629 --> 00:01:58.639
thought this would be a good idea but
 

00:01:58.639 --> 00:02:01.899
thought this would be a good idea but
someone somewhere did and so now we have

00:02:01.899 --> 00:02:01.909
someone somewhere did and so now we have
 

00:02:01.909 --> 00:02:03.969

finished I mean just look at the
beautiful green haze that surrounds

00:02:07.239 --> 00:02:07.249
beautiful green haze that surrounds
 

00:02:07.249 --> 00:02:09.790
beautiful green haze that surrounds
everything I mean essentially and look

00:02:09.790 --> 00:02:09.800
everything I mean essentially and look
 

00:02:09.800 --> 00:02:11.350

rings like then that's it the idea of a
 

00:02:25.340 --> 00:02:27.369
rings like then that's it the idea of a
virtual world basically means that the

00:02:27.369 --> 00:02:27.379
virtual world basically means that the
 

00:02:27.379 --> 00:02:28.710
virtual world basically means that the
developers don't actually

00:02:28.710 --> 00:02:28.720
developers don't actually
 

00:02:28.720 --> 00:02:31.320
