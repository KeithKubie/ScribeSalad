[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:00:05.935 --> 00:00:07.060
MALIKA SAADA SAAR: Welcome.

00:00:07.060 --> 00:00:09.150
My name is Malika Saada Saar.

00:00:09.150 --> 00:00:13.380
I'm Google's Senior Council
on Civil and Human Rights.

00:00:13.380 --> 00:00:18.050
You know, about a year ago,
the great human rights lawyer

00:00:18.050 --> 00:00:21.540
Brian Stevenson came to Google.

00:00:21.540 --> 00:00:24.870
Came to our TGIF,
where all of us

00:00:24.870 --> 00:00:26.580
come together in Mountain View.

00:00:26.580 --> 00:00:30.610
And TGIF is livestreamed
to all of our employees.

00:00:30.610 --> 00:00:35.580
And so, as a company, we came
together to welcome Brian.

00:00:35.580 --> 00:00:41.580
And Brian said to us,
challenged us, to bear witness,

00:00:41.580 --> 00:00:47.740
to be proximate to the human
costs of mass incarceration.

00:00:47.740 --> 00:00:52.260
And so over the year,
in the last 10 months,

00:00:52.260 --> 00:00:56.010
in fact, we have been doing
criminal justice forums

00:00:56.010 --> 00:00:59.100
within Google to
really do what Brian

00:00:59.100 --> 00:01:02.580
asks us to do-- to
bear witness and to be

00:01:02.580 --> 00:01:07.110
proximate to the human
costs of mass incarceration.

00:01:07.110 --> 00:01:11.640
We've had these conversations in
different parts of our company.

00:01:11.640 --> 00:01:16.020
We've thought about and continue
to ask the question of--

00:01:16.020 --> 00:01:22.170
how do we use our platforms
to disrupt mass incarceration?

00:01:22.170 --> 00:01:25.770
Because we know that what
we do at Google is disrupt,

00:01:25.770 --> 00:01:27.420
disrupt for good.

00:01:27.420 --> 00:01:30.050
And if anything needs
to be disrupted,

00:01:30.050 --> 00:01:32.250
its the overcriminalization
of our black

00:01:32.250 --> 00:01:34.830
and brown communities.

00:01:34.830 --> 00:01:38.180
But most of how we've
had that conversation

00:01:38.180 --> 00:01:41.510
has really been
without the words

00:01:41.510 --> 00:01:44.840
and lived experiences
of women and girls.

00:01:44.840 --> 00:01:48.950
And so today, as part of
Women's History Month,

00:01:48.950 --> 00:01:52.460
we want to be able
to delve deeply

00:01:52.460 --> 00:01:57.440
into what is mass incarceration
from the perspective of women

00:01:57.440 --> 00:01:58.370
and girls?

00:01:58.370 --> 00:02:01.590
When we talk about
achieving racial justice,

00:02:01.590 --> 00:02:05.910
how do we do it from
a gendered lens?

00:02:05.910 --> 00:02:08.840
Up to 80% of women
behind bars have

00:02:08.840 --> 00:02:13.150
been subject to some
form of sexual violence.

00:02:13.150 --> 00:02:16.380
Sexual violence is
the primary predictor

00:02:16.380 --> 00:02:19.290
of girls going behind bars.

00:02:19.290 --> 00:02:22.710
And women and girls are
the fastest growing prison

00:02:22.710 --> 00:02:24.300
populations.

00:02:24.300 --> 00:02:27.090
We must have this
conversation as part

00:02:27.090 --> 00:02:32.080
of our overall commitment to
disrupting mass incarceration.

00:02:32.080 --> 00:02:37.020
We cannot have any real
comprehensive discourse around

00:02:37.020 --> 00:02:41.430
criminalization of black and
brown communities without

00:02:41.430 --> 00:02:46.290
centering the experiences
of women and girls.

00:02:46.290 --> 00:02:50.280
And with that, it is my
absolute honor and privilege

00:02:50.280 --> 00:02:54.300
to introduce to you the
founder and Executive Director

00:02:54.300 --> 00:02:57.060
of the National
Council for Formerly

00:02:57.060 --> 00:03:00.780
Incarcerated and Incarcerated
Women and Girls, Andrea James.

00:03:00.780 --> 00:03:06.744
[APPLAUSE]

00:03:06.744 --> 00:03:07.910
ANDREA JAMES: Hi, everybody.

00:03:07.910 --> 00:03:08.690
Thank you.

00:03:08.690 --> 00:03:12.580
I'm not going to be labor
anything beyond what Malika

00:03:12.580 --> 00:03:13.880
has said.

00:03:13.880 --> 00:03:16.910
I cannot underscore enough the
importance of the words that

00:03:16.910 --> 00:03:17.540
she did say.

00:03:17.540 --> 00:03:20.450
I want to say thank you to
everybody here at Google, both

00:03:20.450 --> 00:03:23.720
in this room, and those of
you who are on live stream,

00:03:23.720 --> 00:03:26.930
for tuning in to this
incredibly important issue.

00:03:26.930 --> 00:03:28.970
And I think, without
me going any further,

00:03:28.970 --> 00:03:30.650
you will understand
why it was so

00:03:30.650 --> 00:03:34.160
important by the end of
our time here together.

00:03:34.160 --> 00:03:35.792
Miss Alice, are you there?

00:03:35.792 --> 00:03:37.250
ALICE MARIE JOHNSON:
Yes, I'm here.

00:03:37.250 --> 00:03:39.440
ANDREA JAMES: Can
you see me at all?

00:03:39.440 --> 00:03:40.760
ALICE MARIE JOHNSON: No,
I don't see you right now.

00:03:40.760 --> 00:03:42.200
ANDREA JAMES: OK,
well, I love you.

00:03:42.200 --> 00:03:43.385
I don't know what
I'm doing here.

00:03:43.385 --> 00:03:43.860
ALICE MARIE JOHNSON:
I love you, too.

00:03:43.860 --> 00:03:44.359
Thank you.

00:03:44.359 --> 00:03:46.520
ANDREA JAMES: Topeka's
telling me to do something--

00:03:46.520 --> 00:03:47.050
what phone?

00:03:47.050 --> 00:03:47.800
Oh, here.

00:03:47.800 --> 00:03:48.740
Hi, Miss Alice.

00:03:48.740 --> 00:03:49.910
There you go.

00:03:49.910 --> 00:03:51.770
ALICE MARIE JOHNSON:
Oh, I see you now.

00:03:51.770 --> 00:03:52.540
Hi, Andrea.

00:03:52.540 --> 00:03:53.998
ANDREA JAMES: How
are you, darling?

00:03:53.998 --> 00:03:56.800
OK, so we're going to
begin our conversation.

00:03:56.800 --> 00:04:00.637
You are seeing Miss
Alice Marie Johnson.

00:04:00.637 --> 00:04:02.720
And I'm going to tell you
very briefly, so that we

00:04:02.720 --> 00:04:04.070
can get to Ms.
Johnson, and you're

00:04:04.070 --> 00:04:06.028
going to hear from her
for the rest of the time

00:04:06.028 --> 00:04:08.330
that we're having our
discussion together,

00:04:08.330 --> 00:04:10.980
about the work of
the National Council.

00:04:10.980 --> 00:04:15.380
We are a platform that we have
created, really starting out.

00:04:15.380 --> 00:04:19.070
Because we knew that our
voices needed to be heard.

00:04:19.070 --> 00:04:21.470
Our mantra is nothing
about us without us.

00:04:21.470 --> 00:04:24.230
Because we are the experts,
the women and girls who

00:04:24.230 --> 00:04:26.300
have gone through
the experiences, who

00:04:26.300 --> 00:04:30.260
have been directly affected by
an incredibly unjust, racist,

00:04:30.260 --> 00:04:33.950
classist, and discriminatory
criminal justice system,

00:04:33.950 --> 00:04:37.040
we are the experts that
need to be at the forefront

00:04:37.040 --> 00:04:39.950
and at the table in
creating a policy for--

00:04:39.950 --> 00:04:42.560
not just change, not for
reforming a criminal justice

00:04:42.560 --> 00:04:46.160
system that we don't believe
can be reformed, but in creating

00:04:46.160 --> 00:04:50.684
and shifting radically
to a human justice system

00:04:50.684 --> 00:04:51.600
and what that entails.

00:04:51.600 --> 00:04:53.270
So the National Council
for Incarcerated

00:04:53.270 --> 00:04:55.340
and Formerly Incarcerated
Women and Girls

00:04:55.340 --> 00:04:58.850
was created to connect all
of the powerful, brilliant,

00:04:58.850 --> 00:05:03.470
courageous, brave, incarcerated
and formerly incarcerated women

00:05:03.470 --> 00:05:05.600
and girls across
this country who

00:05:05.600 --> 00:05:08.060
are doing that
work as the experts

00:05:08.060 --> 00:05:11.240
to create the change that
we know needs to happen.

00:05:11.240 --> 00:05:14.180
You're going to hear from
many of them here today.

00:05:14.180 --> 00:05:17.690
And you are privileged to have
the voice of the experience

00:05:17.690 --> 00:05:20.150
of the women that you will
hear from today, starting

00:05:20.150 --> 00:05:21.560
with Miss Alice.

00:05:21.560 --> 00:05:24.170
And the Obama
administration started

00:05:24.170 --> 00:05:26.780
a project called The
Clemency Project 2014,

00:05:26.780 --> 00:05:29.390
obviously it was back in 2014.

00:05:29.390 --> 00:05:31.910
And we went to the mat,
under the leadership

00:05:31.910 --> 00:05:35.340
of our clemency
expert, Amy Povah, who

00:05:35.340 --> 00:05:38.360
was a woman who served years
in the federal prison system

00:05:38.360 --> 00:05:41.690
prior to her sentence being
commuted by President Bill

00:05:41.690 --> 00:05:42.560
Clinton.

00:05:42.560 --> 00:05:45.410
And Amy, we have this thing,
when we leave the prison doors,

00:05:45.410 --> 00:05:49.460
and we're walking out the door,
everybody says don't look back.

00:05:49.460 --> 00:05:50.480
Don't look back.

00:05:50.480 --> 00:05:51.530
It's like a curse.

00:05:51.530 --> 00:05:52.670
Don't look back.

00:05:52.670 --> 00:05:53.314
We love you.

00:05:53.314 --> 00:05:54.230
We want to see you go.

00:05:54.230 --> 00:05:55.340
Do not look back.

00:05:55.340 --> 00:05:57.110
If you look back,
it's like the curse

00:05:57.110 --> 00:05:58.340
is going to bring you back.

00:05:58.340 --> 00:06:00.680
And so we kind of leave
there, and we don't look back.

00:06:00.680 --> 00:06:01.910
Amy Povah looked back.

00:06:01.910 --> 00:06:03.950
She never stopped
looking back from the day

00:06:03.950 --> 00:06:06.680
that she left that prison when
President Bill Clinton commuted

00:06:06.680 --> 00:06:07.460
her sentence.

00:06:07.460 --> 00:06:10.600
She started the organization
Can Do Clemency.

00:06:10.600 --> 00:06:11.900
And please, check it out.

00:06:11.900 --> 00:06:14.100
You are going to see some
of the faces of the women,

00:06:14.100 --> 00:06:16.370
including Miss Alice
that are part of that.

00:06:16.370 --> 00:06:18.710
Well, unfortunately
or fortunately,

00:06:18.710 --> 00:06:21.740
of the very small
number of the thousands

00:06:21.740 --> 00:06:25.670
of women that met
President Obama's criteria,

00:06:25.670 --> 00:06:29.120
but somehow were left
behind, 50 of our women

00:06:29.120 --> 00:06:32.240
did make it out under the
leadership of Amy Povah

00:06:32.240 --> 00:06:34.550
and the women of the
council and women

00:06:34.550 --> 00:06:36.920
across this country that
went to the mat to fight,

00:06:36.920 --> 00:06:39.050
to push these women
out of prison.

00:06:39.050 --> 00:06:43.490
Miss Alice Johnson fit those
criteria, unfortunately,

00:06:43.490 --> 00:06:45.950
and even though she's been
in a prison for decades,

00:06:45.950 --> 00:06:50.090
was not one of the women that
we were able to push out.

00:06:50.090 --> 00:06:53.124
And this is incredibly
painful for us.

00:06:53.124 --> 00:06:54.290
And I'm going to stop there.

00:06:54.290 --> 00:06:55.670
And I'm going to
ask Miss Alice--

00:06:55.670 --> 00:06:57.470
Miss Alice, we love you.

00:06:57.470 --> 00:06:58.916
We understand how incredible--

00:06:58.916 --> 00:07:00.290
Miss Alice is in
a federal prison

00:07:00.290 --> 00:07:02.060
speaking to us right now.

00:07:02.060 --> 00:07:05.510
And I want you to begin, Miss
Alice, by telling us about you

00:07:05.510 --> 00:07:07.220
and about your
story, and why you're

00:07:07.220 --> 00:07:09.920
sitting in that federal prison.

00:07:09.920 --> 00:07:10.941
ALICE MARIE JOHNSON: OK.

00:07:10.941 --> 00:07:11.440
OK.

00:07:11.440 --> 00:07:14.150
My name is Alice Marie Johnson.

00:07:14.150 --> 00:07:18.530
And on May 30th of this
year, I'll be 62-years-old.

00:07:18.530 --> 00:07:23.960
I've already spent a third
of my life behind bars.

00:07:23.960 --> 00:07:28.830
In 1996, my life
drastically changed forever.

00:07:28.830 --> 00:07:32.570
I was convicted as a first
time, non-violent drug offender,

00:07:32.570 --> 00:07:36.230
and sentenced to life
in federal prison.

00:07:36.230 --> 00:07:41.120
I'd always thought that only the
most heinous crimes warranted

00:07:41.120 --> 00:07:43.610
a life without parole sentence.

00:07:43.610 --> 00:07:48.500
I have the exact same
sentence as Charles Manson.

00:07:48.500 --> 00:07:51.220
Prior to coming to prison.

00:07:51.220 --> 00:07:55.040
I lived, I guess you could
say, a pretty productive life.

00:07:55.040 --> 00:07:58.730
I never expected anything
like this to happen to me.

00:07:58.730 --> 00:08:03.230
I had worked in various
professional positions.

00:08:03.230 --> 00:08:05.510
I was working at
Federal Express.

00:08:05.510 --> 00:08:09.960
I had been a manager
with FedEx for 10 years.

00:08:09.960 --> 00:08:11.990
I was also a
facilitator who trained

00:08:11.990 --> 00:08:14.660
other people for management.

00:08:14.660 --> 00:08:18.470
When I lost my job at
10 years with Fed Ex,

00:08:18.470 --> 00:08:20.420
I can tell you that
my life literally

00:08:20.420 --> 00:08:22.920
began to spiral out of control.

00:08:22.920 --> 00:08:27.050
I made one of the worst
choices that I've ever

00:08:27.050 --> 00:08:30.620
made in my life,
which I deeply regret.

00:08:30.620 --> 00:08:35.450
I became involved in
a drug conspiracy.

00:08:35.450 --> 00:08:37.580
I had never sold drugs.

00:08:37.580 --> 00:08:39.830
I had never used drugs.

00:08:39.830 --> 00:08:44.360
And I can tell you, I
literally got in over my head.

00:08:44.360 --> 00:08:47.660
But I tell you, I made
some very different choices

00:08:47.660 --> 00:08:49.940
when I came to prison.

00:08:49.940 --> 00:08:52.960
I want to tell you real quickly,
when I was a young girl,

00:08:52.960 --> 00:08:55.490
I had someone ask
me, Alice, what

00:08:55.490 --> 00:08:57.760
do you want to be
when you grow up?

00:08:57.760 --> 00:09:01.140
And I said, I wanted to
be an incredible woman.

00:09:01.140 --> 00:09:04.430
They said, what is
an incredible woman?

00:09:04.430 --> 00:09:07.040
I said, it's a
woman who goes down

00:09:07.040 --> 00:09:09.940
in history, who makes
changes in life,

00:09:09.940 --> 00:09:14.930
who makes their print in life,
and impacts people's lives.

00:09:14.930 --> 00:09:18.240
That's the kind of woman
that I wanted to be.

00:09:18.240 --> 00:09:23.620
I decided when I came to prison,
that because I was in prison,

00:09:23.620 --> 00:09:27.080
prison bars don't have
to contain your dreams.

00:09:27.080 --> 00:09:30.740
I still wanted to be
an incredible woman.

00:09:30.740 --> 00:09:35.060
So I looked around
my new environment

00:09:35.060 --> 00:09:40.520
to see how I could impact the
society in prison for good.

00:09:40.520 --> 00:09:43.450
So I started serving
others and making

00:09:43.450 --> 00:09:45.350
a difference in their lives.

00:09:45.350 --> 00:09:48.170
I picked up my pen
and I started writing

00:09:48.170 --> 00:09:52.220
plays, plays that were the
largest inmate participation

00:09:52.220 --> 00:09:54.440
programs in the prison.

00:09:54.440 --> 00:09:57.980
People who thought they
couldn't do anything,

00:09:57.980 --> 00:10:01.310
they learned how to do
theatrical productions.

00:10:01.310 --> 00:10:02.720
They learned how to act.

00:10:02.720 --> 00:10:05.090
I started choreographing dance.

00:10:05.090 --> 00:10:09.240
I found people that
the gift of artistry

00:10:09.240 --> 00:10:14.540
was stirred up in them, and
beautiful, beautiful backdrops.

00:10:14.540 --> 00:10:19.850
And our plays became
just known everywhere.

00:10:19.850 --> 00:10:23.300
I also started
mentoring women to see

00:10:23.300 --> 00:10:26.970
if I can help be deterred
from a life of crime.

00:10:26.970 --> 00:10:30.170
I used the experience that I
had with interviewing and job

00:10:30.170 --> 00:10:34.980
preparedness to prepare other
women to go outside and be

00:10:34.980 --> 00:10:36.360
productive citizens.

00:10:36.360 --> 00:10:39.950
ANDREA JAMES: And
Miss Alice, I want

00:10:39.950 --> 00:10:41.800
us to have the
opportunity, Miss Alice,

00:10:41.800 --> 00:10:44.570
to talk a little
bit about the fact

00:10:44.570 --> 00:10:50.450
that we don't have
available to us right now,

00:10:50.450 --> 00:10:53.240
The Clemency Project,
we do not have that.

00:10:53.240 --> 00:10:56.090
We have a Justice
Department now that

00:10:56.090 --> 00:11:01.550
wants to turn the clocks
back to a place in time that

00:11:01.550 --> 00:11:04.910
is dark and draconian
and something that,

00:11:04.910 --> 00:11:08.601
with all of the education that
we have learned over the years

00:11:08.601 --> 00:11:10.850
and throughout the Obama
administration about the need

00:11:10.850 --> 00:11:12.340
to decarcerate--

00:11:12.340 --> 00:11:15.350
why, Miss Alice,
you are in a prison,

00:11:15.350 --> 00:11:17.840
one of many federal
women's prisons

00:11:17.840 --> 00:11:21.910
that are full of
women who are there

00:11:21.910 --> 00:11:26.330
and only but for conspiracy
laws in this country that allow

00:11:26.330 --> 00:11:30.170
these women to be thrown in and
charged and held responsible

00:11:30.170 --> 00:11:32.840
for the same amount
as the person who

00:11:32.840 --> 00:11:34.610
is the leader of the drug ring.

00:11:34.610 --> 00:11:38.540
Why Miss Alice, why is it
so incredibly important

00:11:38.540 --> 00:11:42.200
that we continue and raise
awareness in places like this,

00:11:42.200 --> 00:11:44.720
about the need to
push and to continue

00:11:44.720 --> 00:11:49.430
to push for the freedom of women
like yourself through clemency?

00:11:49.430 --> 00:11:52.110
ALICE MARIE JOHNSON:
Well, conspiracy--

00:11:52.110 --> 00:11:55.340
I can say this about conspiracy.

00:11:55.340 --> 00:11:58.520
Many of the women in here
were women who did not

00:11:58.520 --> 00:12:00.920
have those types of roles.

00:12:00.920 --> 00:12:04.220
But they are charged
with leadership roles.

00:12:04.220 --> 00:12:06.800
They have to take on
the responsibility

00:12:06.800 --> 00:12:08.580
of the entire conspiracy.

00:12:08.580 --> 00:12:10.610
Because I was dumb.

00:12:10.610 --> 00:12:13.820
I was [INAUDIBLE] because
I had never been in prison.

00:12:13.820 --> 00:12:16.130
I didn't even know people
who had served time.

00:12:16.130 --> 00:12:19.010
So I didn't know what a
conspiracy charge meant.

00:12:19.010 --> 00:12:21.830
It means that you are
charged with every element

00:12:21.830 --> 00:12:22.990
of the crime.

00:12:22.990 --> 00:12:25.640
You are held responsible
for every act

00:12:25.640 --> 00:12:29.569
that anyone else has committed,
whether you had knowledge

00:12:29.569 --> 00:12:30.860
of what they were doing or not.

00:12:30.860 --> 00:12:32.840
That's why it's
called conspiracy,

00:12:32.840 --> 00:12:36.010
so it becomes a catch
all for everything.

00:12:36.010 --> 00:12:39.450
And these women, most
of them are mothers.

00:12:39.450 --> 00:12:42.170
I'd say 95% of them are mothers.

00:12:42.170 --> 00:12:44.870
And I tell you, we
know that women,

00:12:44.870 --> 00:12:46.410
not to say anything
about the men,

00:12:46.410 --> 00:12:49.490
but the mother is the
nucleus of the family.

00:12:49.490 --> 00:12:53.270
When a mother is taken out
of the home, so many times

00:12:53.270 --> 00:12:56.810
the family is split apart.

00:12:56.810 --> 00:12:58.940
When a man is taken
out of the home,

00:12:58.940 --> 00:13:01.650
the woman will hold it down.

00:13:01.650 --> 00:13:05.820
But when the women, most of the
time, and it's just the truth--

00:13:05.820 --> 00:13:09.540
the children are sent away
to live with relatives,

00:13:09.540 --> 00:13:13.470
foster care, and too many times
they are sent to the streets

00:13:13.470 --> 00:13:14.930
to be raised that the streets.

00:13:14.930 --> 00:13:18.610
And the cycle of
incarceration continues.

00:13:18.610 --> 00:13:24.200
So this cause of women and
girls is saving the families.

00:13:24.200 --> 00:13:28.140
ANDREA JAMES: Now Miss Alice,
you were a mother, Miss Alice.

00:13:28.140 --> 00:13:29.610
ALICE MARIE JOHNSON: Yes.

00:13:29.610 --> 00:13:30.693
ANDREA JAMES: And you're--

00:13:30.693 --> 00:13:32.110
[INTERPOSING VOICES]

00:13:32.110 --> 00:13:33.212
ALICE MARIE JOHNSON: Yes.

00:13:33.212 --> 00:13:35.670
ANDREA JAMES: You were a mother,
and you know directly what

00:13:35.670 --> 00:13:39.810
that is like to be a mother
who is incarcerated for all

00:13:39.810 --> 00:13:42.820
of the years that you
have been imprisoned,

00:13:42.820 --> 00:13:45.810
and I want to just,
again, commend

00:13:45.810 --> 00:13:49.440
you Miss Alice for
your courage to still

00:13:49.440 --> 00:13:53.160
stay with us, as part of the
team, to raise awareness.

00:13:53.160 --> 00:13:58.470
Because it must have been
incredibly difficult to have

00:13:58.470 --> 00:14:01.200
an opportunity, through
The Clemency Project,

00:14:01.200 --> 00:14:05.040
to maybe gain your
freedom, something that you

00:14:05.040 --> 00:14:07.630
deserved, a lot of
skin in the game.

00:14:07.630 --> 00:14:10.080
We weren't asking for any
favors on your behalf.

00:14:10.080 --> 00:14:12.060
You earned your freedom.

00:14:12.060 --> 00:14:15.960
And yet to have been denied, I
know it was difficult for us.

00:14:15.960 --> 00:14:19.440
We still are challenged with it
every single day, Miss Alice.

00:14:19.440 --> 00:14:22.800
We are here, as your team,
fighting to bring you home.

00:14:22.800 --> 00:14:26.160
But why is it important
that we use our voices

00:14:26.160 --> 00:14:30.600
to encourage this administration
and future administrations

00:14:30.600 --> 00:14:33.990
to use clemency to push
women like yourself out

00:14:33.990 --> 00:14:35.707
who deserve to come home?

00:14:35.707 --> 00:14:37.290
ALICE MARIE JOHNSON:
The fact is there

00:14:37.290 --> 00:14:41.160
is no parole in the
federal system--

00:14:41.160 --> 00:14:46.890
for most of us, for me,
clemency has been our only hope.

00:14:46.890 --> 00:14:51.240
So to not push for clemency
is to take away their hope.

00:14:51.240 --> 00:14:54.990
Because we have exhausted
all of the means.

00:14:54.990 --> 00:14:56.590
I have not been sitting still.

00:14:56.590 --> 00:14:59.940
I have filed motion after
motion in the court.

00:14:59.940 --> 00:15:04.140
But clemency, in itself, is an
act of mercy and forgiveness.

00:15:04.140 --> 00:15:06.150
And when you see a
person like myself

00:15:06.150 --> 00:15:10.020
who has did a complete
turn around in their life,

00:15:10.020 --> 00:15:11.040
who has gotten--

00:15:11.040 --> 00:15:12.450
I've gotten so much support.

00:15:12.450 --> 00:15:14.460
My family fought so hard.

00:15:14.460 --> 00:15:17.400
The Clemency Project was
like putting a carrot,

00:15:17.400 --> 00:15:19.950
and then drawing it back.

00:15:19.950 --> 00:15:22.080
Because we all had so
much hope that that

00:15:22.080 --> 00:15:23.580
was going to come
through, because I

00:15:23.580 --> 00:15:25.300
knew I fit the criteria.

00:15:25.300 --> 00:15:28.560
But as you see, I'm left
behind and I'm still here.

00:15:28.560 --> 00:15:31.320
And this is what I
want to say to Google.

00:15:31.320 --> 00:15:35.790
Google is a company that
has been greatly blessed.

00:15:35.790 --> 00:15:39.480
To whom much is given,
much is required.

00:15:39.480 --> 00:15:43.170
When you use your
voice, people listen.

00:15:43.170 --> 00:15:48.720
When you champion a cause,
our leadership listens.

00:15:48.720 --> 00:15:52.360
You may say am I my
brother's or sister's keeper?

00:15:52.360 --> 00:15:57.070
And I say to you to that,
if not you, then who?

00:15:57.070 --> 00:15:59.490
If not now, then when?

00:15:59.490 --> 00:16:01.470
I don't want to die in prison.

00:16:01.470 --> 00:16:04.530
To say later may
be too late for me.

00:16:04.530 --> 00:16:05.900
I'm already 62.

00:16:05.900 --> 00:16:08.130
I've already spent
two decades in prison.

00:16:08.130 --> 00:16:13.230
So I believe that as
responsible citizens we do

00:16:13.230 --> 00:16:16.440
have a responsibility
to each other.

00:16:16.440 --> 00:16:17.220
We do.

00:16:17.220 --> 00:16:20.100
It is not just a
social issue that you

00:16:20.100 --> 00:16:22.470
put on an agenda that
sounds good on paper.

00:16:22.470 --> 00:16:25.680
It's something you
have to take to heart.

00:16:25.680 --> 00:16:28.500
When you see me and so
many others like me,

00:16:28.500 --> 00:16:31.680
you see I'm just a
representative, a very small

00:16:31.680 --> 00:16:33.750
representative.

00:16:33.750 --> 00:16:36.390
But there's many
more just like me.

00:16:36.390 --> 00:16:38.550
And I don't believe
that the public is safe

00:16:38.550 --> 00:16:41.160
because I'm here.

00:16:41.160 --> 00:16:44.690
I'm non-violent, and I've
already spent 20 years.

00:16:44.690 --> 00:16:49.280
And I've had 100% clear conduct.

00:16:49.280 --> 00:16:53.800
I was on pre-trial
bond for two years.

00:16:53.800 --> 00:16:58.190
I was trusted enough to be
out on bond after my arrest.

00:16:58.190 --> 00:17:02.420
I've proven that I'm
a reformed woman.

00:17:02.420 --> 00:17:04.450
But there's still
no help from me,

00:17:04.450 --> 00:17:08.800
unless someone takes on
this challenge of helping us

00:17:08.800 --> 00:17:14.099
in mass incarceration and using
what you have been gifted with,

00:17:14.099 --> 00:17:16.089
a blessed company.

00:17:16.089 --> 00:17:19.045
We need you, and I
would appreciate it

00:17:19.045 --> 00:17:21.022
if you would help us.

00:17:21.022 --> 00:17:22.522
ANDREA JAMES: Thank
you, Miss Alice.

00:17:22.522 --> 00:17:29.727
[APPLAUSE]

00:17:29.727 --> 00:17:31.310
ANDREA JAMES: Miss
Alice, as we always

00:17:31.310 --> 00:17:33.410
do, we want to remind
you that we are here.

00:17:33.410 --> 00:17:35.160
Your team is out here.

00:17:35.160 --> 00:17:42.949
We will never-- we are here.

00:17:42.949 --> 00:17:44.240
ALICE MARIE JOHNSON: Thank you.

00:17:44.240 --> 00:17:47.670
ANDREA JAMES: And you know
that we are going to continue.

00:17:47.670 --> 00:17:51.110
And we are going to continue
to do this work, hopefully,

00:17:51.110 --> 00:17:53.510
by raising the
consciousness level of what

00:17:53.510 --> 00:17:56.270
you have described perfectly--

00:17:56.270 --> 00:18:02.270
an incredible organization
here at Google and the power

00:18:02.270 --> 00:18:04.130
and the brilliance
that they have,

00:18:04.130 --> 00:18:06.280
that we hope that
they recognize,

00:18:06.280 --> 00:18:07.850
not that they are
special people,

00:18:07.850 --> 00:18:09.850
but they are privileged.

00:18:09.850 --> 00:18:12.440
And people who are privileged
to have a responsibility

00:18:12.440 --> 00:18:14.360
to the rest of the human race.

00:18:14.360 --> 00:18:19.790
So I thank you again for again
coming with us on the road

00:18:19.790 --> 00:18:22.520
and sharing what is
so very difficult

00:18:22.520 --> 00:18:24.200
and to let everybody understand.

00:18:24.200 --> 00:18:26.332
When I hang up this phone
call with Miss Alice,

00:18:26.332 --> 00:18:28.040
I'm going to go and
I'm going to sit down

00:18:28.040 --> 00:18:30.623
and I'm going to listen to the
rest of the women and girls who

00:18:30.623 --> 00:18:31.730
are here with us today.

00:18:31.730 --> 00:18:36.650
Miss Alice is going to go back
to a prison, into a prison cell

00:18:36.650 --> 00:18:39.920
that she has been in
for more than 20 years.

00:18:39.920 --> 00:18:41.580
We need to bring her home.

00:18:41.580 --> 00:18:43.430
And we hope that all
of you here at Google

00:18:43.430 --> 00:18:44.704
will help us to do that.

00:18:44.704 --> 00:18:45.620
Thank you, Miss Alice.

00:18:45.620 --> 00:18:46.430
We love you.

00:18:46.430 --> 00:18:46.930
ALICE MARIE JOHNSON: Thank you.

00:18:46.930 --> 00:18:47.780
I love you, too.

00:18:47.780 --> 00:18:49.280
Thank you so much.

00:18:49.280 --> 00:18:51.387
Thank you, thank you, thank you.

00:18:51.387 --> 00:18:52.970
I'm going to call
your Topeka up here,

00:18:52.970 --> 00:18:55.700
because I don't know what I'm
supposed to do now, Miss Alice.

00:18:55.700 --> 00:18:58.610
But we know that you
like to hang out.

00:18:58.610 --> 00:19:01.831
And Topeka, what
am I doing here?

00:19:01.831 --> 00:19:02.330
OK.

00:19:02.330 --> 00:19:03.440
ALICE MARIE JOHNSON: OK.

00:19:03.440 --> 00:19:03.710
ANDREA JAMES: OK.

00:19:03.710 --> 00:19:05.630
We're going to get to
let you hang out there.

00:19:05.630 --> 00:19:07.760
And Miss Alice is
going to cut off

00:19:07.760 --> 00:19:09.470
when she cuts off,
because she is calling

00:19:09.470 --> 00:19:10.970
from a federal
prison, and they only

00:19:10.970 --> 00:19:12.590
get a tiny window
of opportunity.

00:19:12.590 --> 00:19:15.410
But we like to let her hang
out and listen for as long

00:19:15.410 --> 00:19:18.080
as she can, because it's like
giving her a break from being

00:19:18.080 --> 00:19:18.920
in the prison.

00:19:18.920 --> 00:19:20.630
So I love you, Miss Alice,
we're going to move on.

00:19:20.630 --> 00:19:22.130
ALICE MARIE JOHNSON:
OK, I love you.

00:19:22.130 --> 00:19:23.680
And I love you, Malika.

00:19:23.680 --> 00:19:25.544
I love you--

00:19:25.544 --> 00:19:27.710
ANDREA JAMES: Topeka, Miss
Alice is speaking to you.

00:19:27.710 --> 00:19:28.526
TOPEKA SAM: She's
talking to Malika.

00:19:28.526 --> 00:19:28.934
ALICE MARIE JOHNSON:
Malika and Topeka.

00:19:28.934 --> 00:19:29.750
ANDREA JAMES: Oh, Malika.

00:19:29.750 --> 00:19:30.470
Right there.

00:19:30.470 --> 00:19:32.581
Topeka, Malika, you know what?

00:19:32.581 --> 00:19:33.080
OK.

00:19:33.080 --> 00:19:35.240
ALICE MARIE JOHNSON: Malika
and Topeka, I love you.

00:19:35.240 --> 00:19:35.840
Thank you.

00:19:35.840 --> 00:19:38.090
MALIKA SAADA SAAR: We
love you, Miss Alice.

00:19:38.090 --> 00:19:38.840
I'm going to ask--

00:19:38.840 --> 00:19:39.410
ALICE MARIE JOHNSON: Thank you.

00:19:39.410 --> 00:19:42.380
MALIKA SAADA SAAR: --the women's
panel to come and join us.

00:20:02.180 --> 00:20:07.010
So we want to focus on
the experience of Women

00:20:07.010 --> 00:20:12.170
Behind Bars, and Miss Alice
did a powerful, powerful job

00:20:12.170 --> 00:20:15.980
in helping us to begin to
understand that more deeply.

00:20:15.980 --> 00:20:18.860
And we are so honored
and privileged to have

00:20:18.860 --> 00:20:20.560
your voice, Miss Alice.

00:20:20.560 --> 00:20:22.580
And we're going to make
sure that your voice is

00:20:22.580 --> 00:20:26.850
heard through all the
corridors of Google.

00:20:26.850 --> 00:20:29.930
I want each of you to
introduce yourselves and then

00:20:29.930 --> 00:20:32.677
let's start our conversation.

00:20:32.677 --> 00:20:34.760
MIYHOSI BENTON: Thank Thank
you, Malika and Google

00:20:34.760 --> 00:20:37.620
for having us be a part of this
conversation, a conversation

00:20:37.620 --> 00:20:41.510
that's definitely necessary
and crucial at this time.

00:20:41.510 --> 00:20:42.890
My name is Miyhosi Benton.

00:20:42.890 --> 00:20:44.880
I'm with the Women
in Justice Project.

00:20:44.880 --> 00:20:47.690
And pretty much we [INAUDIBLE]
leadership so it directly

00:20:47.690 --> 00:20:51.590
impacted women to shift
the dynamic change

00:20:51.590 --> 00:20:54.470
to allow the criminal justice
system to be dismantled.

00:20:56.505 --> 00:20:57.630
TOPEKA SAM: Good afternoon.

00:20:57.630 --> 00:20:59.480
My name is Topeka Sam.

00:20:59.480 --> 00:21:02.119
I am the National
Organizer for the National

00:21:02.119 --> 00:21:03.660
Council for Incarcerated
and Formerly

00:21:03.660 --> 00:21:05.430
Incarcerated Women and Girls.

00:21:05.430 --> 00:21:07.180
I'm a formerly
incarcerated woman.

00:21:07.180 --> 00:21:10.310
And I'm also the founder of
the Ladies of Hope Ministries.

00:21:10.310 --> 00:21:12.620
And our goal at the
National Council

00:21:12.620 --> 00:21:16.399
is to end the incarceration
of women and girls.

00:21:16.399 --> 00:21:18.440
MALIKA SAADA SAAR: So I
wanted to ask each of you

00:21:18.440 --> 00:21:24.784
to talk in more depth around how
mass incarceration has impacted

00:21:24.784 --> 00:21:25.325
you directly.

00:21:27.450 --> 00:21:29.450
MIYHOSI BENTON: So mass
incarceration-- so like,

00:21:29.450 --> 00:21:31.940
I was arrested at the age of 19.

00:21:31.940 --> 00:21:34.560
I was two months pregnant.

00:21:34.560 --> 00:21:37.290
And I did a total of four
years in three different states

00:21:37.290 --> 00:21:39.990
New York, New Jersey,
and Pennsylvania.

00:21:39.990 --> 00:21:44.370
And while incarcerated, I
gave birth to my daughter

00:21:44.370 --> 00:21:46.260
at the Bethel Hills
Correctional Facility,

00:21:46.260 --> 00:21:50.400
which is the maximum
facility in New York state.

00:21:50.400 --> 00:21:53.130
And I spent many
birthdays behind bars.

00:21:53.130 --> 00:21:55.890
And when you think about
your 21st birthday,

00:21:55.890 --> 00:21:59.180
you really don't think
about celebrating it inside,

00:21:59.180 --> 00:22:02.010
behind the cell, with the
women you barely know.

00:22:02.010 --> 00:22:04.120
But you make the best of it.

00:22:04.120 --> 00:22:08.970
And as women we make the
best of our situations.

00:22:08.970 --> 00:22:12.114
I was also fortunate to be
able to go into the nursery.

00:22:12.114 --> 00:22:13.530
Bethel Hills
Correctional Facility

00:22:13.530 --> 00:22:16.890
has a nursery where they
allow the woman to stay

00:22:16.890 --> 00:22:19.260
with their children
up to a year.

00:22:19.260 --> 00:22:21.340
And I was able to
bond with my daughter.

00:22:21.340 --> 00:22:23.850
And after I sent her
home, they transferred me

00:22:23.850 --> 00:22:28.050
to Albion Correctional Facility,
which is the medium security

00:22:28.050 --> 00:22:31.680
facility in New York state
on the borderline of Canada.

00:22:31.680 --> 00:22:35.177
And from there, I didn't
receive another visit

00:22:35.177 --> 00:22:36.510
from neither one of my children.

00:22:36.510 --> 00:22:39.930
Because I had a son that was one
years old when I went inside.

00:22:39.930 --> 00:22:44.400
And this is not like
a unique situation.

00:22:44.400 --> 00:22:47.940
75 percent of women that
are incarcerated at the time

00:22:47.940 --> 00:22:49.440
are moms.

00:22:49.440 --> 00:22:52.380
And I was one of those
moms that was far away

00:22:52.380 --> 00:22:55.620
and did not have access to
being able to see my children.

00:22:55.620 --> 00:22:57.570
And speaking on a
phone or letters

00:22:57.570 --> 00:22:59.395
don't cut it when you
have young children,

00:22:59.395 --> 00:23:01.020
and they don't cut
it for any children,

00:23:01.020 --> 00:23:03.780
because you're not
afforded the bond that you

00:23:03.780 --> 00:23:07.950
need to nurture and
to bring them up.

00:23:07.950 --> 00:23:10.980
So after my four years,
I came home and reunited

00:23:10.980 --> 00:23:13.440
with my son and my daughter.

00:23:13.440 --> 00:23:20.810
[APPLAUSE]

00:23:20.810 --> 00:23:29.210
TOPEKA SAM: So my impact
with incarceration

00:23:29.210 --> 00:23:34.580
has started just being an
African-American woman.

00:23:34.580 --> 00:23:38.610
Family members and things
that have been incarcerated

00:23:38.610 --> 00:23:39.520
are friends.

00:23:39.520 --> 00:23:45.000
But my family, my parents, they
were entrepreneurs, franchise

00:23:45.000 --> 00:23:45.500
owners.

00:23:45.500 --> 00:23:48.800
And they had us
living in the area

00:23:48.800 --> 00:23:50.330
where we were the
only black family.

00:23:50.330 --> 00:23:52.700
And partly, it was to
protect us from what was

00:23:52.700 --> 00:23:53.910
happening within the country.

00:23:53.910 --> 00:23:55.493
And the things that
they went through,

00:23:55.493 --> 00:23:57.050
being from New York City.

00:23:57.050 --> 00:23:59.290
And when I went off
to go to college

00:23:59.290 --> 00:24:03.050
is when I got exposed directly
to different things that

00:24:03.050 --> 00:24:05.030
were really happening
in the world,

00:24:05.030 --> 00:24:07.160
and started making
poor choices and really

00:24:07.160 --> 00:24:11.170
buying into the narrative
of what being black

00:24:11.170 --> 00:24:13.520
looked like in America.

00:24:13.520 --> 00:24:16.730
And that entailed
dating guys who

00:24:16.730 --> 00:24:20.940
may have been drug dealing
and things of that nature.

00:24:20.940 --> 00:24:23.630
And then not even
understanding what

00:24:23.630 --> 00:24:26.810
had happened in this country
to even cause it to happen

00:24:26.810 --> 00:24:28.460
within our communities.

00:24:28.460 --> 00:24:33.710
So I had gotten in trouble, and
I would get arrested, and then

00:24:33.710 --> 00:24:35.180
go on probation.

00:24:35.180 --> 00:24:36.540
And it was a cycle.

00:24:36.540 --> 00:24:42.440
Yet still in college and
still maintaining employment

00:24:42.440 --> 00:24:45.320
and building a career
or starting a business.

00:24:45.320 --> 00:24:48.590
And so when I was incarcerated
in federal prison,

00:24:48.590 --> 00:24:51.270
I was incarcerated
for 3 and 1/2 years.

00:24:51.270 --> 00:24:53.300
And part of what Miss
Alice spoke about,

00:24:53.300 --> 00:24:54.800
and what Miyhosi
just touched on,

00:24:54.800 --> 00:24:59.360
was the fact that I had met so
many women who had children.

00:24:59.360 --> 00:25:02.120
And so many women in
the federal prison--

00:25:02.120 --> 00:25:05.060
we are taken far, far away.

00:25:05.060 --> 00:25:07.430
In the Northeast,
Danbury, Connecticut

00:25:07.430 --> 00:25:09.680
was the only women's
federal prison.

00:25:09.680 --> 00:25:12.380
And I was camp designated,
so I was in Danbury.

00:25:12.380 --> 00:25:15.150
And you had women from all
up and down the East Coast

00:25:15.150 --> 00:25:16.950
and Midwest who were there.

00:25:16.950 --> 00:25:19.430
Yet I would be in
the visiting room,

00:25:19.430 --> 00:25:21.830
and there would be no one there.

00:25:21.830 --> 00:25:24.540
And partly, it's because
you had the parents, who

00:25:24.540 --> 00:25:27.320
were home, who are elderly on
fixed incomes, who were taking

00:25:27.320 --> 00:25:31.580
care of the children and
had to choose whether or not

00:25:31.580 --> 00:25:35.000
they could have the children
go to see their parents

00:25:35.000 --> 00:25:38.210
or feed the children and
make sure that they were OK.

00:25:38.210 --> 00:25:41.330
And in then meeting women
who had had already done

00:25:41.330 --> 00:25:45.170
20 years in prison,
I knew at that point

00:25:45.170 --> 00:25:48.350
that it was my
responsibility to then take

00:25:48.350 --> 00:25:51.440
what it was that I learned, even
being impacted by a conspiracy

00:25:51.440 --> 00:25:55.500
charge, and by the grace of God,
I did not get life in prison.

00:25:55.500 --> 00:25:57.800
But those conspiracy
laws are just that.

00:25:57.800 --> 00:26:00.200
I had no drugs in
my case at all.

00:26:00.200 --> 00:26:04.950
Yet I was charged with
having 80 kilos of cocaine.

00:26:04.950 --> 00:26:08.840
So when you look at
just how that law is

00:26:08.840 --> 00:26:11.600
and what is in place and what
it does to our communities,

00:26:11.600 --> 00:26:15.020
specifically women and girls.

00:26:15.020 --> 00:26:16.910
One of the policies in
the reform that we're

00:26:16.910 --> 00:26:21.330
doing at the National Council is
to change that conspiracy law.

00:26:21.330 --> 00:26:26.030
So now as a national organizer,
we go around the country.

00:26:26.030 --> 00:26:29.900
We are mobilizing, hoping to
get 100,000 members, which

00:26:29.900 --> 00:26:32.570
includes formerly incarcerated
and incarcerated women,

00:26:32.570 --> 00:26:35.870
directly impacted children
of incarcerated parents,

00:26:35.870 --> 00:26:40.220
and people like you who are
movement family and allies who

00:26:40.220 --> 00:26:43.010
can help us in moving this work
and getting the message out

00:26:43.010 --> 00:26:45.020
so that we can end the
incarceration of women

00:26:45.020 --> 00:26:45.759
and girls.

00:26:45.759 --> 00:26:47.300
MALIKA SAADA SAAR:
So, Topeka, I want

00:26:47.300 --> 00:26:49.280
to just surface
more of what you're

00:26:49.280 --> 00:26:51.410
talking about with the
conspiracy charges.

00:26:51.410 --> 00:26:54.200
Because we know,
right, that most women

00:26:54.200 --> 00:26:56.630
who are behind bars
at federal and state

00:26:56.630 --> 00:27:00.110
correctional facilities
are mothers to children

00:27:00.110 --> 00:27:01.670
under the age of 18.

00:27:01.670 --> 00:27:05.540
We know that most women
and mothers behind bars

00:27:05.540 --> 00:27:09.710
are first time,
nonviolent felons.

00:27:09.710 --> 00:27:12.950
What is going on with
the conspiracy charges--

00:27:12.950 --> 00:27:16.190
that first time
nonviolent felons,

00:27:16.190 --> 00:27:19.880
who are mothers to children
under the age of 18,

00:27:19.880 --> 00:27:24.260
are being put behind bars for
20 years or a lifetime sentence?

00:27:24.260 --> 00:27:26.150
Can you explain that more to us?

00:27:26.150 --> 00:27:27.110
TOPEKA SAM: Absolutely.

00:27:27.110 --> 00:27:33.260
It's happening because
it's a retaliation tactic.

00:27:33.260 --> 00:27:36.590
It's used because, if
you don't cooperate

00:27:36.590 --> 00:27:38.660
in whatever the charges
are-- and a lot of times

00:27:38.660 --> 00:27:41.370
the women really have
no idea what's going on.

00:27:41.370 --> 00:27:43.100
I mean think about you.

00:27:43.100 --> 00:27:45.560
Do you really know what your
boyfriend or your husband

00:27:45.560 --> 00:27:47.260
is doing when they leave you?

00:27:47.260 --> 00:27:48.350
You don't.

00:27:48.350 --> 00:27:52.610
And so they want you to then
speak on information that you

00:27:52.610 --> 00:27:55.010
don't-- make up information,
it's people that you may not

00:27:55.010 --> 00:27:57.170
have even met in the conspiracy.

00:27:57.170 --> 00:27:59.930
Yet, if you don't
cooperate, you end up

00:27:59.930 --> 00:28:03.130
getting hit with-- as Miss
Alice described-- everything

00:28:03.130 --> 00:28:05.420
that's in that charge.

00:28:05.420 --> 00:28:07.400
And then you ending
up in life in prison

00:28:07.400 --> 00:28:10.890
because of the sentencing
guidelines and the guidelines

00:28:10.890 --> 00:28:11.390
chart.

00:28:11.390 --> 00:28:14.180
And the fact that
you are charged

00:28:14.180 --> 00:28:18.080
based on the amount of
drugs that is said to have--

00:28:18.080 --> 00:28:19.850
not actually have.

00:28:19.850 --> 00:28:22.130
So they call it ghost dope.

00:28:22.130 --> 00:28:26.240
You don't even have to find it,
yet you'll be charged with it.

00:28:26.240 --> 00:28:28.610
And that's how the system
is being manipulated

00:28:28.610 --> 00:28:31.520
and so many women and girls
are being caught and swept

00:28:31.520 --> 00:28:33.110
into the conspiracy.

00:28:33.110 --> 00:28:37.780
And yet it's really a conspiracy
against our women and girls.

00:28:37.780 --> 00:28:41.150
MALIKA SAADA SAAR: Do you
want to add to that, Miyhosi?

00:28:41.150 --> 00:28:42.260
MIYHOSI BENTON: Um, no.

00:28:42.260 --> 00:28:44.760
MALIKA SAADA SAAR: I'm going
to ask you a different question

00:28:44.760 --> 00:28:47.300
to add to, but but I just
want to make sure that people

00:28:47.300 --> 00:28:48.530
understand what you've said.

00:28:48.530 --> 00:28:50.750
Because this is really
one of the key ways

00:28:50.750 --> 00:28:53.120
that when we talk
about the war on drugs

00:28:53.120 --> 00:28:56.210
and the over prosecution of
black and brown communities

00:28:56.210 --> 00:28:58.700
and the overcriminalization
that has happened,

00:28:58.700 --> 00:29:02.120
these conspiracy
charges are at the heart

00:29:02.120 --> 00:29:06.800
of how we talk about the war
on drugs' devastating impact

00:29:06.800 --> 00:29:08.060
on our communities.

00:29:08.060 --> 00:29:10.460
But often what doesn't
get talked about

00:29:10.460 --> 00:29:13.640
is the particular ways
that it's played out

00:29:13.640 --> 00:29:16.100
in the lives of women.

00:29:16.100 --> 00:29:18.620
So Miyhosi, I wanted
to talk to you

00:29:18.620 --> 00:29:22.820
about this issue of conditions
of confinement for our women

00:29:22.820 --> 00:29:24.370
and mothers.

00:29:24.370 --> 00:29:30.320
When I was heading up an NGO
on gender-based violence,

00:29:30.320 --> 00:29:33.560
some women who were
previously incarcerated

00:29:33.560 --> 00:29:37.460
talked to me about how
they had been, during labor

00:29:37.460 --> 00:29:39.340
and childbirth, shackled.

00:29:39.340 --> 00:29:41.330
And I thought they
were explaining to me

00:29:41.330 --> 00:29:45.500
like some crazy thing that
was an aberrant violation

00:29:45.500 --> 00:29:49.010
of practice and policy
at a southern prison,

00:29:49.010 --> 00:29:52.100
because they were
coming from Tennessee.

00:29:52.100 --> 00:29:56.210
And I started to find out
that actually shackling women

00:29:56.210 --> 00:29:59.750
during labor and childbirth
is standard procedure.

00:29:59.750 --> 00:30:02.570
It was standard procedure in
all of our federal correctional

00:30:02.570 --> 00:30:03.590
facilities.

00:30:03.590 --> 00:30:06.350
Fortunately, we were
able to change that.

00:30:06.350 --> 00:30:11.810
It remains standard procedure
in most of our state prisons.

00:30:11.810 --> 00:30:14.480
So let me be clear
in what I am saying.

00:30:14.480 --> 00:30:18.050
When a woman behind
bars who is pregnant

00:30:18.050 --> 00:30:22.880
is in labor and childbirth,
she is shackled.

00:30:22.880 --> 00:30:26.000
She's shackled by
her arms, her legs.

00:30:26.000 --> 00:30:29.630
I heard one case of a
belly shackle during labor.

00:30:29.630 --> 00:30:31.790
Can you talk to us
more about this policy

00:30:31.790 --> 00:30:35.630
and the incredible work that
you've done to change it?

00:30:35.630 --> 00:30:38.790
MIYHOSI BENTON: So I
was one of those women.

00:30:38.790 --> 00:30:40.200
I was illegally shackled.

00:30:40.200 --> 00:30:44.190
In New York state, we
had a law, a 2009 law

00:30:44.190 --> 00:30:48.090
that banned the barbaric
shackle in a pregnant women.

00:30:48.090 --> 00:30:50.910
When I went in 2009,
I was pregnant.

00:30:50.910 --> 00:30:53.820
I gave birth to my
daughter in 2010.

00:30:53.820 --> 00:30:57.270
And when you're inside,
you don't know your rights.

00:30:57.270 --> 00:30:59.670
And that's one of the
ways they control you.

00:30:59.670 --> 00:31:02.490
By not allowing you
to educate yourself

00:31:02.490 --> 00:31:05.430
or to educate you on
what your rights are.

00:31:05.430 --> 00:31:08.110
So the less you know,
the best for them.

00:31:08.110 --> 00:31:11.280
So I didn't know that it was
illegal to shackle me while I

00:31:11.280 --> 00:31:13.620
was in labor or delivering.

00:31:13.620 --> 00:31:16.830
And my experience, where I was--

00:31:16.830 --> 00:31:21.260
so just imagine, for me, like
for anyone, giving birth--

00:31:21.260 --> 00:31:23.550
like a joyous moment,
a moment that you're

00:31:23.550 --> 00:31:26.140
supposed to be with your
loved ones, your family,

00:31:26.140 --> 00:31:29.340
sharing and welcoming
a new life--

00:31:29.340 --> 00:31:32.640
and that moment being
distorted and corrupted

00:31:32.640 --> 00:31:37.020
by a correctional
officer who doesn't

00:31:37.020 --> 00:31:39.390
have any good
intentions towards you.

00:31:39.390 --> 00:31:41.760
It's malicious energy.

00:31:41.760 --> 00:31:44.610
And for me, while
I was giving birth,

00:31:44.610 --> 00:31:47.340
I had the correction officer
standing between my legs

00:31:47.340 --> 00:31:50.610
while pushing, while
the doctor was pushing.

00:31:50.610 --> 00:31:53.920
And you know, you
want to say something.

00:31:53.920 --> 00:31:56.220
And you want to like,
try to understand

00:31:56.220 --> 00:31:59.580
how can someone in their
right mind think it's OK.

00:31:59.580 --> 00:32:01.560
Like, how is this
humanly possible

00:32:01.560 --> 00:32:03.930
that anyone in the world
would think it's OK for you

00:32:03.930 --> 00:32:07.800
to stand where I'm trying
to deliver my baby?

00:32:07.800 --> 00:32:09.465
And not only put
my life at risk,

00:32:09.465 --> 00:32:11.470
but my child's life at risk?

00:32:11.470 --> 00:32:14.580
So you not only strip me
of my dignity, my respect,

00:32:14.580 --> 00:32:17.700
my self-worth, but you going
to put my life in danger

00:32:17.700 --> 00:32:19.630
and my child's life in danger?

00:32:19.630 --> 00:32:22.230
So for me that was
a really hard part.

00:32:22.230 --> 00:32:25.410
And then the correctional
officer and the doctor

00:32:25.410 --> 00:32:28.350
was arguing, because the
doctor did understand

00:32:28.350 --> 00:32:30.450
like, this is my job.

00:32:30.450 --> 00:32:32.490
This was her job
to deliver the baby

00:32:32.490 --> 00:32:34.330
and make sure the mom
and the baby was OK.

00:32:34.330 --> 00:32:35.955
And she couldn't do
her job to the best

00:32:35.955 --> 00:32:39.080
of her abilities because
of the correction officer.

00:32:39.080 --> 00:32:43.710
But after I gave birth,
they automatically

00:32:43.710 --> 00:32:45.600
handcuff you right away.

00:32:45.600 --> 00:32:48.090
Like, you don't really
even have a moment to bond

00:32:48.090 --> 00:32:50.130
with your child,
not to feed them,

00:32:50.130 --> 00:32:53.170
not to just hold them and
take in that precious moment.

00:32:53.170 --> 00:32:58.091
And when you give
birth, they send you

00:32:58.091 --> 00:32:59.340
to Westchester Medical Center.

00:32:59.340 --> 00:33:02.910
So you are in a prison ward
inside a Westchester Medical

00:33:02.910 --> 00:33:03.616
Center.

00:33:03.616 --> 00:33:06.240
And then they bring you in, they
shackle and they handcuff you.

00:33:06.240 --> 00:33:08.490
And they may allow you
to see your child maybe

00:33:08.490 --> 00:33:10.660
once or twice, if you're lucky.

00:33:10.660 --> 00:33:12.720
But in that process, once
again you're shackled

00:33:12.720 --> 00:33:14.700
and you're handcuffed,
and it's the metal

00:33:14.700 --> 00:33:17.010
chain around your waist,
and it's the handcuffs,

00:33:17.010 --> 00:33:18.410
and it's the ankle shackles.

00:33:18.410 --> 00:33:20.910
And then you're brought into a
wheelchair to see your child.

00:33:20.910 --> 00:33:24.600
And they remove
just the handcuffs.

00:33:24.600 --> 00:33:26.860
So you literally cannot
walk with your child.

00:33:26.860 --> 00:33:28.860
And all of these things
are illegal at the time,

00:33:28.860 --> 00:33:31.170
and no one is held
accountable for these things.

00:33:31.170 --> 00:33:34.920
So it is OK for us to be put
into the criminal justice

00:33:34.920 --> 00:33:36.510
system for breaking the law.

00:33:36.510 --> 00:33:39.630
But it's OK for the
Department of Corrections

00:33:39.630 --> 00:33:41.640
to break it day in and day out.

00:33:41.640 --> 00:33:42.180
Why?

00:33:42.180 --> 00:33:44.430
Because they do not
value our lives.

00:33:44.430 --> 00:33:48.330
Black girls, women-- our
lives are not valued--

00:33:48.330 --> 00:33:51.840
not in society, not in the
current administrative system

00:33:51.840 --> 00:33:54.060
that we have right now,
not inside a prison.

00:33:54.060 --> 00:33:55.320
Our lives are not valued.

00:33:55.320 --> 00:33:58.340
And it was just
another reminder.

00:33:58.340 --> 00:34:02.820
So after I went through
that whole process

00:34:02.820 --> 00:34:06.390
of being traumatized and
humiliated and just--

00:34:06.390 --> 00:34:09.780
I thought, like, when I come
home, I have to speak up.

00:34:09.780 --> 00:34:11.699
Because if we don't
speak up, the ones who

00:34:11.699 --> 00:34:15.000
are being criminalized, the
ones who are being dehumanized,

00:34:15.000 --> 00:34:17.580
if we don't speak
up, then who will?

00:34:17.580 --> 00:34:19.080
It's our stories.

00:34:19.080 --> 00:34:20.880
We're the ones who
are experiencing

00:34:20.880 --> 00:34:24.480
these horrific
injustices all the time.

00:34:24.480 --> 00:34:29.130
So I came home, and I met
with [INAUDIBLE] Tamar,

00:34:29.130 --> 00:34:31.770
who was at the correctional
association at the time.

00:34:31.770 --> 00:34:34.320
And they came up to me
and was, like, well,

00:34:34.320 --> 00:34:35.940
were you illegally shackled?

00:34:35.940 --> 00:34:37.260
And I was like, I was.

00:34:37.260 --> 00:34:40.116
Like, I was so excited
that there was something--

00:34:40.116 --> 00:34:41.699
and there was
organizations and people

00:34:41.699 --> 00:34:44.370
out there that cared
and were fighting it.

00:34:44.370 --> 00:34:45.330
So I got involved.

00:34:45.330 --> 00:34:49.230
And what we did, we spoke
to legislators at Albany.

00:34:49.230 --> 00:34:50.159
We had letters.

00:34:50.159 --> 00:34:53.250
We dealt with the media.

00:34:53.250 --> 00:34:56.340
We did interviews,
and we rallied outside

00:34:56.340 --> 00:34:58.200
of the governor's office.

00:34:58.200 --> 00:34:59.280
We fought and fought.

00:34:59.280 --> 00:35:01.440
We made films about
the experience

00:35:01.440 --> 00:35:03.780
of what we had to go through.

00:35:03.780 --> 00:35:07.470
And we was able to have
this progressive law pass.

00:35:07.470 --> 00:35:11.880
So it reinforced the 2009 law.

00:35:11.880 --> 00:35:16.290
And it also expanded it so your
whole pregnancy you were not

00:35:16.290 --> 00:35:19.500
allowed to be shackled
and handcuffed at all.

00:35:19.500 --> 00:35:22.950
And you had the
privacy of not having

00:35:22.950 --> 00:35:25.920
to worry about a correctional
officer being inside

00:35:25.920 --> 00:35:28.710
your room while giving birth.

00:35:28.710 --> 00:35:29.970
It expanded so much.

00:35:29.970 --> 00:35:32.880
[APPLAUSE]

00:35:32.880 --> 00:35:34.980
And New York state
now has the most

00:35:34.980 --> 00:35:38.140
progressive anti-shackling
law in the country.

00:35:38.140 --> 00:35:42.330
And it's because a woman
directly impacted speaking up

00:35:42.330 --> 00:35:44.509
in collaboration with allies.

00:35:44.509 --> 00:35:46.050
And that would not
have been possible

00:35:46.050 --> 00:35:50.040
if it was not for the chances
that we had to speak our piece

00:35:50.040 --> 00:35:51.450
and to make it right.

00:35:51.450 --> 00:35:54.000
And we have to continue to
do this for any injustice

00:35:54.000 --> 00:35:55.710
that we witnessed
or that we bear.

00:35:55.710 --> 00:36:00.720
[APPLAUSE]

00:36:00.720 --> 00:36:02.700
MALIKA SAADA SAAR:
Thank you for your work.

00:36:02.700 --> 00:36:06.160
Topeka, we are at
this incredible moment

00:36:06.160 --> 00:36:11.980
around how, finally, it's
a bipartisan conversation

00:36:11.980 --> 00:36:14.290
on ending mass incarceration.

00:36:14.290 --> 00:36:17.450
Finally, we have
Republicans and Democrats,

00:36:17.450 --> 00:36:22.000
and in the public square,
talking about the war on drugs

00:36:22.000 --> 00:36:24.940
was an egregious
violation of human rights.

00:36:24.940 --> 00:36:29.950
Finally, we are saying that
mass incarceration must end.

00:36:29.950 --> 00:36:33.940
But the women who
have been locked up,

00:36:33.940 --> 00:36:37.150
who are still behind
bars, like Miss Alice,

00:36:37.150 --> 00:36:40.570
are not part of
these conversations.

00:36:40.570 --> 00:36:44.260
What needs to happen
in order to make sure

00:36:44.260 --> 00:36:47.740
that at this critical
moment of reform

00:36:47.740 --> 00:36:50.650
the women are not left behind?

00:36:50.650 --> 00:36:53.860
TOPEKA SAM: Well, what needs to
happen is what's happening now.

00:36:53.860 --> 00:36:56.590
Women like you, who are
in these spaces, who

00:36:56.590 --> 00:37:00.580
are making it necessary, and
are committing to this work

00:37:00.580 --> 00:37:04.090
to allow us, those who have
been directly impacted,

00:37:04.090 --> 00:37:06.430
to have our seat at the table.

00:37:06.430 --> 00:37:10.300
Our mantra at the council is
nothing about us without us.

00:37:10.300 --> 00:37:12.590
And so that's because, as
Andrea had said earlier,

00:37:12.590 --> 00:37:14.080
we are the experts.

00:37:14.080 --> 00:37:16.240
And how do you know
what we need if you

00:37:16.240 --> 00:37:19.240
don't ask us and
engage us in changing

00:37:19.240 --> 00:37:21.040
these laws and these policies?

00:37:21.040 --> 00:37:24.700
And as Miss Alice said, I
just want to reinforce that,

00:37:24.700 --> 00:37:26.800
if not you, then who?

00:37:26.800 --> 00:37:29.380
You can't look to your neighbor
or look to someone else

00:37:29.380 --> 00:37:32.320
and say that it's
their responsibility.

00:37:32.320 --> 00:37:36.490
As humans in this world,
it is our responsibility

00:37:36.490 --> 00:37:38.530
and commitment to
one another in order

00:37:38.530 --> 00:37:41.050
to make sure that
we are shifting this

00:37:41.050 --> 00:37:45.610
to this disgusting
criminal justice system

00:37:45.610 --> 00:37:50.074
into a more human
justice system.

00:37:50.074 --> 00:37:52.230
MALIKA SAADA SAAR:
Miyhosi, I want to ask you,

00:37:52.230 --> 00:37:54.850
as we get ready to
end this panel, what

00:37:54.850 --> 00:37:58.600
needs to happen to make
sure that the stories,

00:37:58.600 --> 00:38:02.200
the lived experience,
and expertise of women

00:38:02.200 --> 00:38:05.627
is part of our conversation
on racial justice?

00:38:05.627 --> 00:38:07.210
MIYHOSI BENTON: I
think before we even

00:38:07.210 --> 00:38:08.584
say what needs to
be happening, I

00:38:08.584 --> 00:38:10.480
think we need to
recognize and acknowledge

00:38:10.480 --> 00:38:12.550
what has been happening.

00:38:12.550 --> 00:38:16.300
So women on the inside always
played leadership roles.

00:38:16.300 --> 00:38:18.370
They made change when
change was needed.

00:38:18.370 --> 00:38:21.280
In New York state, I can
speak for New York state,

00:38:21.280 --> 00:38:24.730
in New York state, women
brought college back.

00:38:24.730 --> 00:38:27.850
They had the first
HIV education program,

00:38:27.850 --> 00:38:30.380
which was modeled across
the whole country.

00:38:30.380 --> 00:38:33.456
They also had the children
center and parenting centers.

00:38:33.456 --> 00:38:35.080
These are the kind
of things that women

00:38:35.080 --> 00:38:36.910
did before coming out.

00:38:36.910 --> 00:38:39.550
And then now, they're out,
and they still fighting.

00:38:39.550 --> 00:38:41.620
So I feel like we
just need to keep

00:38:41.620 --> 00:38:45.040
in mind these are the women we
need to have at the forefront.

00:38:45.040 --> 00:38:48.017
These are the women that had the
experience and the expertise.

00:38:48.017 --> 00:38:49.600
And these are the
women that are going

00:38:49.600 --> 00:38:51.790
to be change agents
to shift away

00:38:51.790 --> 00:38:54.550
from that perpetual
punishment paradigm

00:38:54.550 --> 00:38:58.780
to one of accountability,
transformation, and healing.

00:38:58.780 --> 00:39:00.820
MALIKA SAADA SAAR:
So when I talked

00:39:00.820 --> 00:39:04.180
about this panel to some folks,
the response was, well, so,

00:39:04.180 --> 00:39:06.910
where's the policy
person, or the lawmaker?

00:39:06.910 --> 00:39:08.390
And I said, right here.

00:39:08.390 --> 00:39:08.890
Right?

00:39:08.890 --> 00:39:12.610
You all are the
ones that we need.

00:39:12.610 --> 00:39:16.090
And we so desperately,
desperately need your voices.

00:39:16.090 --> 00:39:17.920
And we're deeply
honored at Google

00:39:17.920 --> 00:39:19.430
to be able to have you here.

00:39:19.430 --> 00:39:19.960
TOPEKA SAM: Thank you.

00:39:19.960 --> 00:39:21.043
MIYHOSI BENTON: Thank you.

00:39:21.043 --> 00:39:27.580
[APPLAUSE]

00:39:27.580 --> 00:39:29.750
MARQUESHA BABERS:
Hello, everyone.

00:39:29.750 --> 00:39:30.250
Hi.

00:39:30.250 --> 00:39:32.230
My name is Marquesha.

00:39:32.230 --> 00:39:35.020
I'm going to be doing a
poem for you guys today.

00:39:35.020 --> 00:39:36.190
It's called "Imprisoned."

00:39:36.190 --> 00:39:40.270
And it's about more than just
being imprisoned physically.

00:39:40.270 --> 00:39:43.930
It's about being in a prison
emotionally and mentally.

00:39:43.930 --> 00:39:45.540
So here I go.

00:39:45.540 --> 00:39:46.885
It's called "Imprisoned."

00:39:50.850 --> 00:39:55.590
Imprisoned in a dark and gloomy
chamber, I am imprisoned,

00:39:55.590 --> 00:39:59.190
my feet chained together,
hands chained behind me.

00:39:59.190 --> 00:40:03.660
I'm afraid of what might happen
if I fight, so I sit silently.

00:40:03.660 --> 00:40:07.680
Imprisoned in a dark and gloomy
chamber, I am imprisoned.

00:40:07.680 --> 00:40:10.080
Mouth taped shut
so I can't scream.

00:40:10.080 --> 00:40:12.720
I close my eyes and
sleep, so I can dream.

00:40:12.720 --> 00:40:16.200
Imprisoned in a dark and gloomy
chamber, I am imprisoned.

00:40:16.200 --> 00:40:18.930
Hands and feet chained together
with suffering, depression,

00:40:18.930 --> 00:40:19.620
and doubt.

00:40:19.620 --> 00:40:22.080
But it doesn't take much to
break these chains and get out.

00:40:22.080 --> 00:40:25.380
Imprisoned in a dark and gloomy
chamber, I am imprisoned.

00:40:25.380 --> 00:40:27.690
Mouth taped shut with
words I can't speak.

00:40:27.690 --> 00:40:29.240
Words like I am smart.

00:40:29.240 --> 00:40:30.030
I am pretty.

00:40:30.030 --> 00:40:31.440
Words like release me.

00:40:31.440 --> 00:40:34.050
No longer imprisoned in a
dark and gloomy chamber,

00:40:34.050 --> 00:40:35.640
no longer am I imprisoned.

00:40:35.640 --> 00:40:38.160
I've found the key to remove
these chains from my hands

00:40:38.160 --> 00:40:38.740
and feet.

00:40:38.740 --> 00:40:41.730
I'm not afraid to fight you,
fear, so don't challenge me.

00:40:41.730 --> 00:40:44.340
No longer imprisoned in a
dark and gloomy chamber,

00:40:44.340 --> 00:40:45.630
no longer am I imprisoned.

00:40:45.630 --> 00:40:48.480
Cut this tape from my mouth
so I can scream and shout.

00:40:48.480 --> 00:40:51.480
It's a great thing when you
make a reality out of a dream.

00:40:51.480 --> 00:40:53.760
No longer imprisoned in a
dark and gloomy chamber,

00:40:53.760 --> 00:40:55.200
no longer am I imprisoned.

00:40:55.200 --> 00:40:58.800
I stand fearless, no longer
imprisoned in a dark and gloomy

00:40:58.800 --> 00:41:00.960
chamber, I stand worthy.

00:41:00.960 --> 00:41:03.440
No longer imprisoned in a
dark and gloomy chamber,

00:41:03.440 --> 00:41:05.490
I stand peaceful.

00:41:05.490 --> 00:41:08.880
No longer imprisoned in this
dark and gloomy chamber,

00:41:08.880 --> 00:41:11.490
no longer am I imprisoned.

00:41:11.490 --> 00:41:12.130
Thank you.

00:41:12.130 --> 00:41:13.534
[APPLAUSE]

00:41:16.369 --> 00:41:17.660
ANA KASPARIAN: Hello, everyone.

00:41:17.660 --> 00:41:19.060
My name's Anna Kasparian.

00:41:19.060 --> 00:41:21.490
I come from a news background.

00:41:21.490 --> 00:41:23.410
I am a reporter and
host at "The Young

00:41:23.410 --> 00:41:27.150
Turks," which is a very
progressive online news show.

00:41:27.150 --> 00:41:29.330
Thank you.

00:41:29.330 --> 00:41:31.457
I just want to take
a minute to thank

00:41:31.457 --> 00:41:33.790
the organizers of this event
for giving me the privilege

00:41:33.790 --> 00:41:36.070
to be here and to
be part of this,

00:41:36.070 --> 00:41:38.950
and also to be inspired by
the resilience of the women

00:41:38.950 --> 00:41:40.660
that we've already heard from.

00:41:40.660 --> 00:41:42.490
And of course,
there are more women

00:41:42.490 --> 00:41:44.050
that we're going to hear from.

00:41:44.050 --> 00:41:46.330
In this portion
of the event, I am

00:41:46.330 --> 00:41:49.840
going to speak to an
incarcerated woman, Ms. Santra

00:41:49.840 --> 00:41:53.890
Rucker, and also her
daughter, Kendia Riley.

00:41:53.890 --> 00:41:58.360
And it's more about
the difficulty

00:41:58.360 --> 00:42:01.210
of establishing a
relationship, as a woman

00:42:01.210 --> 00:42:04.480
who has been incarcerated due to
this egregious justice system,

00:42:04.480 --> 00:42:06.700
establishing a relationship
with your family members,

00:42:06.700 --> 00:42:07.750
with your children.

00:42:07.750 --> 00:42:09.940
We've already heard
about the number

00:42:09.940 --> 00:42:14.410
of women who are incarcerated
and do have young children

00:42:14.410 --> 00:42:17.950
and have a difficult time
having a relationship with them

00:42:17.950 --> 00:42:19.300
as a result of this.

00:42:19.300 --> 00:42:20.734
So do we have--

00:42:20.734 --> 00:42:22.900
MALIKA SAADA SAAR: We're
going to start with Kendia.

00:42:22.900 --> 00:42:23.990
ANA KASPARIAN: Oh, we're
going to start with, OK.

00:42:23.990 --> 00:42:25.864
That's great so we're
actually going to start

00:42:25.864 --> 00:42:29.060
with Cindia Riley, and--

00:42:29.060 --> 00:42:30.060
Kendia Riley.

00:42:30.060 --> 00:42:30.782
I apologize.

00:42:30.782 --> 00:42:31.490
Sorry about that.

00:42:34.010 --> 00:42:37.270
So-- OK, can we sit over there?

00:42:37.270 --> 00:42:37.780
OK, great.

00:42:50.990 --> 00:42:53.730
Thank you so much for being
here and having a conversation

00:42:53.730 --> 00:42:55.980
with me about something
that's so incredibly important

00:42:55.980 --> 00:42:57.780
and doesn't get talked
about, honestly,

00:42:57.780 --> 00:43:00.330
in the field of work
that I do, in journalism.

00:43:00.330 --> 00:43:02.550
So tell me a little
bit about your story.

00:43:02.550 --> 00:43:05.280
What is it like establishing a
relationship with your mother?

00:43:05.280 --> 00:43:07.620
I know that she was
given a life sentence

00:43:07.620 --> 00:43:09.970
when you were two years old.

00:43:09.970 --> 00:43:12.840
KENDIA RILEY: So
both of my parents

00:43:12.840 --> 00:43:16.290
have been incarcerated with
life sentences since I was two.

00:43:16.290 --> 00:43:20.100
So it's kind of
been like a seesaw

00:43:20.100 --> 00:43:22.620
between trying to communicate
with the both of them.

00:43:22.620 --> 00:43:24.600
And I was raised
underneath my grandparents.

00:43:24.600 --> 00:43:27.240
So when my mother went
to prison, obviously,

00:43:27.240 --> 00:43:29.550
it was either she gives
me to somebody else,

00:43:29.550 --> 00:43:32.280
or I'd be in a
foster home, or just

00:43:32.280 --> 00:43:34.380
under the care of somebody else.

00:43:34.380 --> 00:43:37.890
So she gave power of
attorney to my grandparents.

00:43:37.890 --> 00:43:41.790
And in that time, it was
as if the relationship

00:43:41.790 --> 00:43:44.010
between my mother
and my father and I

00:43:44.010 --> 00:43:46.260
had been transferred
to my grandparents.

00:43:46.260 --> 00:43:49.950
So it was as if they became
my actual, legitimate parents.

00:43:49.950 --> 00:43:52.980
And the relationship
that you would typically

00:43:52.980 --> 00:43:57.750
have as a child, where I
would maybe talk to my mom

00:43:57.750 --> 00:44:01.290
individually or ride in a
car, it ceased to exist.

00:44:01.290 --> 00:44:03.420
All of our holidays,
whether it's

00:44:03.420 --> 00:44:06.390
Christmas or
birthdays or anything,

00:44:06.390 --> 00:44:09.090
we had to go through
it in a visiting room.

00:44:09.090 --> 00:44:13.500
Or we never had that
physical relationship,

00:44:13.500 --> 00:44:16.050
that caring and nurturing.

00:44:16.050 --> 00:44:18.570
That there's just that
availability for both of us

00:44:18.570 --> 00:44:22.110
to sit down and be able
to communicate thoroughly

00:44:22.110 --> 00:44:23.610
and adequately.

00:44:23.610 --> 00:44:26.220
And I think that's
most effective when

00:44:26.220 --> 00:44:30.452
it comes to that actual
stable relationship

00:44:30.452 --> 00:44:31.410
between the two of you.

00:44:31.410 --> 00:44:34.710
Because no matter how much
you talk on the phone--

00:44:34.710 --> 00:44:38.940
where you have 15 minute
phone calls that cost $3,

00:44:38.940 --> 00:44:41.310
and you have 300
minutes a month.

00:44:41.310 --> 00:44:43.350
The way that my father's
visitation is set up

00:44:43.350 --> 00:44:45.550
is he can only get
five visits a month.

00:44:45.550 --> 00:44:48.870
And out of 365 days, that's
just 60 visits a year.

00:44:48.870 --> 00:44:52.450
So not only are we
just restricted,

00:44:52.450 --> 00:44:55.020
it's like we can never
have a relationship

00:44:55.020 --> 00:44:57.120
with real sentimental value.

00:44:57.120 --> 00:44:59.040
Because once my
parents come home,

00:44:59.040 --> 00:45:01.140
they don't truly know who I am.

00:45:01.140 --> 00:45:04.440
And we have to sit,
and I guess, take that,

00:45:04.440 --> 00:45:06.990
and try to build off of it.

00:45:06.990 --> 00:45:09.570
And my mother has
a release date now.

00:45:09.570 --> 00:45:11.852
So it's 2022.

00:45:11.852 --> 00:45:13.560
So it's about five or
six years from now.

00:45:13.560 --> 00:45:17.580
But when she comes home, I'll be
freshly graduated from college.

00:45:17.580 --> 00:45:20.160
And it will be the both
of us sitting in the room

00:45:20.160 --> 00:45:23.520
while I'm an adult, and I'm
a grown woman at this point.

00:45:23.520 --> 00:45:25.187
And she's older.

00:45:25.187 --> 00:45:27.270
And we're trying to place
ourselves in a situation

00:45:27.270 --> 00:45:30.840
where we're getting to know
who each other really truly is.

00:45:30.840 --> 00:45:33.210
And it's kind of devastating
for the both of us.

00:45:33.210 --> 00:45:37.470
And it's practically traumatic,
because we don't know anything.

00:45:37.470 --> 00:45:42.270
And the things that she should
know from me being two or three

00:45:42.270 --> 00:45:44.550
and watching me grow
and watching what I like

00:45:44.550 --> 00:45:47.047
and what I love, that's absent.

00:45:47.047 --> 00:45:48.630
And I don't know
what she truly likes.

00:45:48.630 --> 00:45:52.020
Because it's not the
same as if you're

00:45:52.020 --> 00:45:53.520
riding in a car
with your parent.

00:45:53.520 --> 00:45:56.070
And you sit down,
and you hear a song,

00:45:56.070 --> 00:45:57.540
and you say, oh, I like this.

00:45:57.540 --> 00:45:59.490
And she says, she likes it, too.

00:45:59.490 --> 00:46:02.730
And then we can actually
vibe and enjoy it together,

00:46:02.730 --> 00:46:05.220
versus being on the telephone,
and I say, oh, I like this,

00:46:05.220 --> 00:46:06.510
and she agrees.

00:46:06.510 --> 00:46:08.239
And it's just not the same.

00:46:08.239 --> 00:46:09.780
ANA KASPARIAN: I
think a lot of times

00:46:09.780 --> 00:46:12.630
when we hear about
incarceration and how

00:46:12.630 --> 00:46:15.840
we need to reform our
criminal justice system--

00:46:15.840 --> 00:46:17.400
and it's always
funny to me that it's

00:46:17.400 --> 00:46:19.983
called the justice system, when
there's such a lack of justice

00:46:19.983 --> 00:46:23.160
involved-- we don't really
think about the impact it

00:46:23.160 --> 00:46:26.682
has on the family members of the
person who gets incarcerated.

00:46:26.682 --> 00:46:28.890
Of course, it's a mass
injustice for the person who's

00:46:28.890 --> 00:46:30.270
incarcerated, but
also the family

00:46:30.270 --> 00:46:33.630
members who are torn from their
mothers and their fathers.

00:46:33.630 --> 00:46:38.030
And so I came across an event
that you actually spoke at,

00:46:38.030 --> 00:46:39.840
where you talked
about the first time

00:46:39.840 --> 00:46:42.960
that you had physical
contact with your mother.

00:46:42.960 --> 00:46:44.704
And I thought that
it was so incredible.

00:46:44.704 --> 00:46:46.620
And it shared a perspective
that I don't think

00:46:46.620 --> 00:46:47.884
most people really know about.

00:46:47.884 --> 00:46:49.550
So can you talk about
that a little bit?

00:46:49.550 --> 00:46:52.332
KENDIA RILEY: So
I was speaking on,

00:46:52.332 --> 00:46:53.790
I can't remember
what event it was,

00:46:53.790 --> 00:46:58.180
but my grandmother,
when I was younger,

00:46:58.180 --> 00:47:00.420
she used to take me to
all the different places.

00:47:00.420 --> 00:47:03.330
And my mother was first
in Danbury, Connecticut,

00:47:03.330 --> 00:47:05.050
and we were living in Virginia.

00:47:05.050 --> 00:47:06.750
So that was also
not even the hike.

00:47:06.750 --> 00:47:09.540
We had a fixed income, as
Topeka spoke of earlier.

00:47:09.540 --> 00:47:12.180
So it was hard to travel,
hard to actually get

00:47:12.180 --> 00:47:13.890
that money to go there.

00:47:13.890 --> 00:47:18.000
So Mother's Days we would
go when I was younger.

00:47:18.000 --> 00:47:20.890
But when I became older, it
became a lot more difficult.

00:47:20.890 --> 00:47:22.980
We had a lot more
responsibilities.

00:47:22.980 --> 00:47:25.920
And I didn't realize--

00:47:25.920 --> 00:47:28.080
and it was over this
past summer that I

00:47:28.080 --> 00:47:29.382
went to go visit her in June.

00:47:29.382 --> 00:47:30.840
And I hadn't realized
that I hadn't

00:47:30.840 --> 00:47:32.740
seen my mother for 10 years.

00:47:32.740 --> 00:47:35.850
And when I went to go
visit her, the only thing

00:47:35.850 --> 00:47:37.950
I could remember was
the smell of her hair

00:47:37.950 --> 00:47:40.920
and just sitting in the
visiting room seeing

00:47:40.920 --> 00:47:42.900
how happy and excited
she was to see me

00:47:42.900 --> 00:47:46.500
and then watching everything
just unfold, from the fact

00:47:46.500 --> 00:47:48.890
that the last time she
had actually seen me I

00:47:48.890 --> 00:47:50.790
was eight or nine years old.

00:47:50.790 --> 00:47:51.740
And I was little.

00:47:51.740 --> 00:47:53.220
I was innocent.

00:47:53.220 --> 00:47:56.210
I hadn't been through all the
traumatic events and turmoil

00:47:56.210 --> 00:48:00.030
that I had endured
at that point.

00:48:00.030 --> 00:48:03.080
So looking at her was like
looking at a complete stranger.

00:48:03.080 --> 00:48:06.200
And I couldn't remember
how she looked.

00:48:06.200 --> 00:48:09.680
And just looking
at her, and telling

00:48:09.680 --> 00:48:12.080
my aunt, who visited
with me, and just saying,

00:48:12.080 --> 00:48:13.940
wow, we really do look alike.

00:48:13.940 --> 00:48:16.880
And just kind of looking
into her eyes and thinking,

00:48:16.880 --> 00:48:20.140
I've never seen you
past a photograph.

00:48:20.140 --> 00:48:24.954
Or I've never heard your voice
constantly in front of me,

00:48:24.954 --> 00:48:26.870
like actually going
through my ears other than

00:48:26.870 --> 00:48:28.970
through like the
static of a telephone.

00:48:28.970 --> 00:48:32.660
And I think sitting there and
smelling her and just taking me

00:48:32.660 --> 00:48:34.460
back to the innocence
of my childhood

00:48:34.460 --> 00:48:36.800
and just remembering
that I'm in this, that I

00:48:36.800 --> 00:48:40.220
was in the same exact
predicament as I was then.

00:48:40.220 --> 00:48:43.940
ANA KASPARIAN: How
has your experience

00:48:43.940 --> 00:48:47.940
with having an incarcerated
mother impacted your future?

00:48:47.940 --> 00:48:51.590
Because in every sense of the
word, you are a success story.

00:48:51.590 --> 00:48:54.770
You have a successful
academic career,

00:48:54.770 --> 00:48:56.870
and you've persevered
through what

00:48:56.870 --> 00:48:59.630
most people would stereotype
as something that's impossible,

00:48:59.630 --> 00:49:00.170
right?

00:49:00.170 --> 00:49:02.655
So can you talk to me a
little bit about that.

00:49:02.655 --> 00:49:05.030
KENDIA RILEY: So I feel as
though, with the incarceration

00:49:05.030 --> 00:49:07.010
of both of my
parents, it's embedded

00:49:07.010 --> 00:49:09.770
like a sense of determination
within me, that's kind of--

00:49:09.770 --> 00:49:12.860
I feel if they hadn't
been incarcerated,

00:49:12.860 --> 00:49:15.660
it wouldn't be as stable
in there as it is.

00:49:15.660 --> 00:49:20.060
Because when I was younger,
when I was in elementary school,

00:49:20.060 --> 00:49:22.460
they said that I had
behavioral issues.

00:49:22.460 --> 00:49:23.770
And it was maybe--

00:49:23.770 --> 00:49:25.520
I was in multi-age,
which is a combination

00:49:25.520 --> 00:49:29.130
of first and second
grade, and I would act up.

00:49:29.130 --> 00:49:30.690
I would threaten my teachers.

00:49:30.690 --> 00:49:32.690
I would do all of the above.

00:49:32.690 --> 00:49:36.530
And one day, I wrote a letter
to my teacher threatening her,

00:49:36.530 --> 00:49:39.200
and they had to get a police
officer to come into the room.

00:49:39.200 --> 00:49:42.980
And he had to tell me that
threatening was a felony

00:49:42.980 --> 00:49:45.730
and that basically it
was just irrefutable,

00:49:45.730 --> 00:49:47.750
you can't do that type of thing.

00:49:47.750 --> 00:49:51.230
And my dean stopped and
said, you're so smart.

00:49:51.230 --> 00:49:52.550
I don't understand why.

00:49:52.550 --> 00:49:53.510
Why are you doing it?

00:49:53.510 --> 00:49:55.490
And I told him that I
wanted to go with my parents

00:49:55.490 --> 00:49:56.448
and be with my parents.

00:49:56.448 --> 00:49:59.270
And I thought getting in trouble
would place me in a situation

00:49:59.270 --> 00:50:01.240
where I go to prison
with the both of them.

00:50:01.240 --> 00:50:02.990
And then he explained
that it would either

00:50:02.990 --> 00:50:04.700
get me in juvenile
detention or I'd

00:50:04.700 --> 00:50:07.060
have to go to Merrimack,
which was the main institution

00:50:07.060 --> 00:50:07.670
in Virginia.

00:50:07.670 --> 00:50:11.210
And it was like
that day forward,

00:50:11.210 --> 00:50:14.780
I knew that it was
physically impossible for me

00:50:14.780 --> 00:50:16.310
to be with them at all times.

00:50:16.310 --> 00:50:19.460
And it just set a standard
for me and an expectation

00:50:19.460 --> 00:50:24.320
that, I naturally had
the ability to do well,

00:50:24.320 --> 00:50:26.750
so why not just do well
for the sake of them,

00:50:26.750 --> 00:50:28.550
or for the sake of myself?

00:50:28.550 --> 00:50:31.550
Because if I-- and like, just
the way the police officer

00:50:31.550 --> 00:50:32.600
explained it.

00:50:32.600 --> 00:50:34.970
And just saying how
it's not the same.

00:50:34.970 --> 00:50:37.200
I'm not going to be in
a facility with them,

00:50:37.200 --> 00:50:39.590
and it's not what
I think it to be.

00:50:39.590 --> 00:50:41.270
And just thinking
of, oh, I don't

00:50:41.270 --> 00:50:44.590
want to end up in that
situation at all or ultimately.

00:50:44.590 --> 00:50:46.730
And just trying to be
better and set the stakes.

00:50:46.730 --> 00:50:50.150
And let them know, so they
wouldn't have that burden,

00:50:50.150 --> 00:50:53.150
where they know their child--
and I know it's a lot of blame

00:50:53.150 --> 00:50:55.400
can go on the parents while
they're in prison for what

00:50:55.400 --> 00:50:57.590
happens to the children
while they're inside--

00:50:57.590 --> 00:51:00.590
and I didn't want to be the one
that ended up on the streets.

00:51:00.590 --> 00:51:03.440
And my father when
he was interviewed

00:51:03.440 --> 00:51:06.440
for Humans of New York, he
said that I was the exception

00:51:06.440 --> 00:51:08.090
for a lot of his children.

00:51:08.090 --> 00:51:11.120
And just the fact that
he said I had a brother

00:51:11.120 --> 00:51:13.280
that I didn't even know
about, that as soon

00:51:13.280 --> 00:51:15.260
as he got in prison
about a year later,

00:51:15.260 --> 00:51:17.570
he ended up being killed
because of following

00:51:17.570 --> 00:51:18.920
in the footsteps of him.

00:51:18.920 --> 00:51:21.507
And he said, it's children like
me that should be the norm.

00:51:21.507 --> 00:51:23.090
When they have an
incarcerated parent,

00:51:23.090 --> 00:51:25.280
we should still be able
to do well, and still

00:51:25.280 --> 00:51:27.890
be able to excel, and
do things differently.

00:51:27.890 --> 00:51:30.170
So I feel like my
future is impact

00:51:30.170 --> 00:51:31.850
because it gives me a role.

00:51:31.850 --> 00:51:34.130
And it gives me,
not only which I've

00:51:34.130 --> 00:51:37.640
found my voice because of
Topeka, I found my voice truly

00:51:37.640 --> 00:51:38.690
and honestly.

00:51:38.690 --> 00:51:42.410
Because I had never spoke about
it until I came to a point

00:51:42.410 --> 00:51:45.080
where I was so destitute
and by myself and alone.

00:51:45.080 --> 00:51:46.710
And I was just hurting.

00:51:46.710 --> 00:51:50.030
And it was everybody that
my mother had left me

00:51:50.030 --> 00:51:52.100
with had passed away.

00:51:52.100 --> 00:51:53.210
So I was 18.

00:51:53.210 --> 00:51:55.560
Living by myself,
about to go to college.

00:51:55.560 --> 00:51:57.860
I was, like, there
was no one to take me.

00:51:57.860 --> 00:51:59.760
No one to help me
with that transition.

00:51:59.760 --> 00:52:01.718
And it just got to a
point where I had nothing.

00:52:01.718 --> 00:52:02.810
I didn't have any money.

00:52:02.810 --> 00:52:06.170
And it grew to the point where
I had to go and do everything

00:52:06.170 --> 00:52:07.530
by myself.

00:52:07.530 --> 00:52:09.491
So when Topeka
came, and said, hey,

00:52:09.491 --> 00:52:11.990
would you like to speak on a
panel about how it affects you?

00:52:11.990 --> 00:52:15.650
I never really thought about
how it had majorly impacted

00:52:15.650 --> 00:52:18.140
my life, and I was numb to it.

00:52:18.140 --> 00:52:21.500
And it was just I was
so succumbed to feeling,

00:52:21.500 --> 00:52:22.830
like everything was normal.

00:52:22.830 --> 00:52:24.500
Oh, I'd go visit them
in visiting rooms.

00:52:24.500 --> 00:52:26.180
I'd talk to them on the phone.

00:52:26.180 --> 00:52:29.130
It was just seeing
my vulnerability.

00:52:29.130 --> 00:52:31.160
And then realizing
that every single time

00:52:31.160 --> 00:52:33.410
I spoke it was like I was
learning something different

00:52:33.410 --> 00:52:34.190
about myself.

00:52:34.190 --> 00:52:37.220
So I feel like from an
educational standpoint,

00:52:37.220 --> 00:52:39.770
it shows that you can
practically do anything.

00:52:39.770 --> 00:52:43.550
And like Topeka said earlier,
I do a lot of stuff with grace.

00:52:43.550 --> 00:52:48.290
So it makes me feel like I'm
powerful, that I'm invincible.

00:52:48.290 --> 00:52:50.180
And it makes it really
takes me to a point

00:52:50.180 --> 00:52:52.280
where, just because you
don't have your parents,

00:52:52.280 --> 00:52:54.490
you still have that
ability to do better and go

00:52:54.490 --> 00:52:56.805
beyond what anybody can
tell you that you can do.

00:52:56.805 --> 00:52:57.305
[APPLAUSE]

00:52:57.305 --> 00:52:58.554
ANA KASPARIAN: That's amazing.

00:53:04.010 --> 00:53:06.740
So I just wanted to quickly
note on "The Young Turks,"

00:53:06.740 --> 00:53:09.110
we often bring up the
issue of white privilege,

00:53:09.110 --> 00:53:12.170
which, unfortunately, some
of our audience members

00:53:12.170 --> 00:53:13.700
get very offended about.

00:53:13.700 --> 00:53:15.770
And the reason why I'm
bringing that up right now

00:53:15.770 --> 00:53:18.620
is because these are
the types of obstacles

00:53:18.620 --> 00:53:23.840
that the disenfranchised have
to persevere through in order

00:53:23.840 --> 00:53:25.940
to become success
stories, right?

00:53:25.940 --> 00:53:28.400
These are the issues that
I think a lot of people

00:53:28.400 --> 00:53:31.610
don't realize occur, that
we have a biased justice

00:53:31.610 --> 00:53:34.160
system, that we have
certain obstacles

00:53:34.160 --> 00:53:36.860
for certain communities that
people like me don't ever

00:53:36.860 --> 00:53:37.760
have to worry about.

00:53:37.760 --> 00:53:41.030
And that's the reason why I feel
that it's important for someone

00:53:41.030 --> 00:53:43.340
like me to be an ally, to
hear stories like yours,

00:53:43.340 --> 00:53:46.460
and do what I can to fight
to reform the justice

00:53:46.460 --> 00:53:48.140
system that we have right now.

00:53:48.140 --> 00:53:50.630
If there's one final thing
that you would want everyone

00:53:50.630 --> 00:53:53.540
to know about how all
of this has impacted you

00:53:53.540 --> 00:53:57.059
and your relationship with
your family, what would it be?

00:53:57.059 --> 00:53:59.600
KENDIA RILEY: So I think, and
especially over the last couple

00:53:59.600 --> 00:54:03.560
of days, that just separating
a mother from her daughter

00:54:03.560 --> 00:54:06.620
or father from her daughter
is really just rifting.

00:54:06.620 --> 00:54:08.900
And like I said earlier,
it's really numbing.

00:54:08.900 --> 00:54:11.450
Where you get to
this point that you

00:54:11.450 --> 00:54:14.900
want to know each other so well,
and it seems so impossible,

00:54:14.900 --> 00:54:19.240
because there's so many physical
limitations and monetary--

00:54:19.240 --> 00:54:24.770
it's just so much stuff where it
takes you away from really ever

00:54:24.770 --> 00:54:26.900
having that capability
to establish

00:54:26.900 --> 00:54:29.900
a real physical relationship.

00:54:29.900 --> 00:54:35.750
And just the idea that, if
you're arguing, if you're sad,

00:54:35.750 --> 00:54:39.084
or you're having just a
debate, or just a bad day,

00:54:39.084 --> 00:54:41.750
there's no way that you can just
hop up and say, I'm going to go

00:54:41.750 --> 00:54:43.340
visit my mom.

00:54:43.340 --> 00:54:45.710
You have to sit on
the phone, and then

00:54:45.710 --> 00:54:50.270
from every single penny of
every second you're talking,

00:54:50.270 --> 00:54:53.390
it's going to either go to waste
or go to a really good cause

00:54:53.390 --> 00:54:54.500
of talking on the phone.

00:54:54.500 --> 00:54:58.040
And I think more
lately with my mother,

00:54:58.040 --> 00:55:01.380
it's been we have
such limited time.

00:55:01.380 --> 00:55:04.090
But it's like we're going
and talking back and forth

00:55:04.090 --> 00:55:06.590
and battling about what we know
about each other and what we

00:55:06.590 --> 00:55:07.370
don't.

00:55:07.370 --> 00:55:11.450
And just to sit back and
think, if you were home,

00:55:11.450 --> 00:55:12.950
we wouldn't have to do this.

00:55:12.950 --> 00:55:15.920
Or to think about other
daughters that might not

00:55:15.920 --> 00:55:18.170
have the maturity that
I have or might not

00:55:18.170 --> 00:55:20.960
have that ability to even talk.

00:55:20.960 --> 00:55:24.770
And I just think that it's
unfair to the children,

00:55:24.770 --> 00:55:26.270
and it's just
unfair to all of us

00:55:26.270 --> 00:55:31.040
or anybody who can sit and allow
a parent to not be able to be

00:55:31.040 --> 00:55:32.960
with their child in some sense.

00:55:32.960 --> 00:55:36.290
Or just not to think about
every single stipulation

00:55:36.290 --> 00:55:38.870
that surrounds being
with their child.

00:55:38.870 --> 00:55:42.710
And just thinking, if you
have a child yourself,

00:55:42.710 --> 00:55:45.710
and you take yourself and
separate them, and put them

00:55:45.710 --> 00:55:49.520
in a room, and you guys are just
divided by these four walls,

00:55:49.520 --> 00:55:52.220
and you have no way of
communicating with each other

00:55:52.220 --> 00:55:56.030
without her sliding $1
under the door or $5

00:55:56.030 --> 00:55:57.749
for a limited amount of time.

00:55:57.749 --> 00:56:00.290
And just thinking about how you
could build that relationship

00:56:00.290 --> 00:56:02.180
or how that could taint you.

00:56:02.180 --> 00:56:04.490
And it's just not, I
don't think that when

00:56:04.490 --> 00:56:07.100
they are making the policies
and the legislation around it,

00:56:07.100 --> 00:56:09.126
they don't think about
us as the children.

00:56:09.126 --> 00:56:10.250
They think about the crime.

00:56:10.250 --> 00:56:14.120
But they don't put in place
that you're hurting us as well.

00:56:14.120 --> 00:56:17.000
While my mom's in prison,
that puts me in prison, too.

00:56:17.000 --> 00:56:18.470
So it's not just affecting them.

00:56:18.470 --> 00:56:22.147
We both have to live it
together and simultaneously.

00:56:22.147 --> 00:56:24.480
ANA KASPARIAN: Thank you so
much for sharing your story.

00:56:24.480 --> 00:56:25.146
I appreciate it.

00:56:25.146 --> 00:56:28.640
[APPLAUSE]

00:56:28.640 --> 00:56:31.360
MALIKA SAADA SAAR: Before
Kendia leaves the stage,

00:56:31.360 --> 00:56:34.090
I want to acknowledge
that not only is

00:56:34.090 --> 00:56:39.670
Kendia a powerful, fierce
woman advocate for so

00:56:39.670 --> 00:56:44.420
many other girls and boys
whose parents are behind bars,

00:56:44.420 --> 00:56:53.290
but Kendia is also a sophomore
at the University of Virginia,

00:56:53.290 --> 00:56:57.510
majoring in chemistry and
minoring in astronomy.

00:56:57.510 --> 00:57:03.560
[CHEERING]

00:57:03.560 --> 00:57:07.070
So because it's our
commitment to bring

00:57:07.070 --> 00:57:10.970
in the voices of the
women behind bars,

00:57:10.970 --> 00:57:14.180
we have a little bit
of time before we

00:57:14.180 --> 00:57:17.690
can bring Kendia's mom
in through the phone.

00:57:17.690 --> 00:57:19.970
We can't do it until 2:10.

00:57:19.970 --> 00:57:24.710
So before we bring
Kendia's mom onto the call,

00:57:24.710 --> 00:57:26.090
I'm going to do two things.

00:57:26.090 --> 00:57:30.230
I'm going to ask Andrea James
to join the stage with Kendia

00:57:30.230 --> 00:57:36.440
and Ana to help represent, while
we're waiting for Santra Rucker

00:57:36.440 --> 00:57:40.580
to join us, to talk about
more the experience of being

00:57:40.580 --> 00:57:44.240
a mother behind bars and
that mother-child bond, which

00:57:44.240 --> 00:57:47.900
as Ana pointed out, is
rarely talked about when

00:57:47.900 --> 00:57:51.470
we have these conversations
around the criminal justice

00:57:51.470 --> 00:57:52.560
system.

00:57:52.560 --> 00:57:54.740
So I invite you all,
and Ana, thank you

00:57:54.740 --> 00:57:55.880
for going with the flow.

00:57:55.880 --> 00:57:57.110
KENDIA RILEY: Of
course, my pleasure.

00:57:57.110 --> 00:57:58.651
MALIKA SAADA SAAR:
And before you all

00:57:58.651 --> 00:58:00.380
get started on
that conversation,

00:58:00.380 --> 00:58:02.090
there are these
pictures that have

00:58:02.090 --> 00:58:04.400
been flashing on these screens.

00:58:04.400 --> 00:58:07.850
And these pictures are
remarkable paintings

00:58:07.850 --> 00:58:11.300
done by women and
girls behind bars

00:58:11.300 --> 00:58:16.130
as part of an organization
known as Artistic Noise.

00:58:16.130 --> 00:58:18.800
It's a New York-based
organization

00:58:18.800 --> 00:58:24.230
that goes into our correctional
facilities, adult and juvenile,

00:58:24.230 --> 00:58:28.940
and gives young women and
men and boys and girls

00:58:28.940 --> 00:58:32.660
and our elders the chance
to have art in their lives

00:58:32.660 --> 00:58:36.980
as an opportunity to express
their emotions, their pain,

00:58:36.980 --> 00:58:37.700
and their joy.

00:58:37.700 --> 00:58:40.250
So I want to acknowledge
these beautiful paintings

00:58:40.250 --> 00:58:43.400
that Artistic Noise has
allowed us to share with you.

00:58:46.840 --> 00:58:48.790
ANA KASPARIAN: So
I think it's also

00:58:48.790 --> 00:58:52.720
important to maybe focus
a little bit on the types

00:58:52.720 --> 00:58:55.030
of laws, like the war on drugs.

00:58:55.030 --> 00:58:59.740
And some of the influences
behind those types of policies

00:58:59.740 --> 00:59:02.440
that lead to individuals
being incarcerated

00:59:02.440 --> 00:59:04.970
for ridiculous reasons.

00:59:04.970 --> 00:59:07.240
So since I come from
a news background

00:59:07.240 --> 00:59:09.730
and do a lot of reporting
on the justice system

00:59:09.730 --> 00:59:12.700
and also policies that
politicians propose,

00:59:12.700 --> 00:59:15.850
there are a lot of
financial interests at play

00:59:15.850 --> 00:59:19.420
that force, not force,
but influence politicians

00:59:19.420 --> 00:59:24.250
to push for sentencing
that's incredibly harsh

00:59:24.250 --> 00:59:29.140
related to drug policy or
for mandatory minimums,

00:59:29.140 --> 00:59:30.110
things like that.

00:59:30.110 --> 00:59:32.500
And so it's not an accident.

00:59:32.500 --> 00:59:34.300
What we're seeing in
our justice system

00:59:34.300 --> 00:59:38.680
is a direct influence of
things like money and politics,

00:59:38.680 --> 00:59:43.270
of private prisons encouraging
our representatives

00:59:43.270 --> 00:59:48.280
to pass legislation that would
incarcerate people for profit.

00:59:48.280 --> 00:59:50.450
And so I don't want
anyone to think that,

00:59:50.450 --> 00:59:52.870
hey, these are people who
are just tough on crime.

00:59:52.870 --> 00:59:55.280
It's not being about
tough on crime.

00:59:55.280 --> 00:59:58.960
It's about victimizing
people to make a dollar.

00:59:58.960 --> 01:00:01.600
And I think that that's an
important issue that everyone

01:00:01.600 --> 01:00:02.750
needs to focus on.

01:00:02.750 --> 01:00:06.280
The women that we've heard
from today are not criminals.

01:00:06.280 --> 01:00:08.860
These are innocent
individuals who

01:00:08.860 --> 01:00:12.030
have been victimized by
an injust justice system,

01:00:12.030 --> 01:00:14.410
or unjust, I should
say, justice system.

01:00:14.410 --> 01:00:16.630
So I can't help but
share my opinion.

01:00:16.630 --> 01:00:20.139
I know no one told me that
I should or if I could,

01:00:20.139 --> 01:00:22.180
but I can't help myself
because this is something

01:00:22.180 --> 01:00:23.840
that I'm very passionate about.

01:00:23.840 --> 01:00:25.800
And I really do
want reform here.

01:00:25.800 --> 01:00:29.380
Anyway, so thank you
for joining us, Andrea.

01:00:29.380 --> 01:00:32.680
So talk to me a little bit
about your experiences.

01:00:32.680 --> 01:00:36.130
You've been working in this
line of work for a long time.

01:00:36.130 --> 01:00:38.010
And I think it's so
incredibly important.

01:00:38.010 --> 01:00:40.990
Can we talk a little bit more
about the positive impacts

01:00:40.990 --> 01:00:47.910
that women such as yourself
have had in this space?

01:00:47.910 --> 01:00:49.099
ANDREA JAMES: Oh, sure.

01:00:49.099 --> 01:00:50.890
I want to dial back
just a little bit, just

01:00:50.890 --> 01:00:54.520
so we can just, so we
can touch upon the issues

01:00:54.520 --> 01:00:55.840
that Kendia was talking about.

01:00:55.840 --> 01:00:58.720
Because as a woman--
so I was a lawyer

01:00:58.720 --> 01:01:00.760
who was sentenced
to serve a 24 month

01:01:00.760 --> 01:01:02.800
sentence in the federal
prison for women

01:01:02.800 --> 01:01:03.850
in Danbury, Connecticut.

01:01:03.850 --> 01:01:06.580
OK, I was allowed
to self-report.

01:01:06.580 --> 01:01:07.300
I was a lawyer.

01:01:07.300 --> 01:01:08.510
We were treated differently.

01:01:08.510 --> 01:01:09.760
I showed up in court twice.

01:01:09.760 --> 01:01:13.060
Once to hear the charges against
me, and the other to hear what

01:01:13.060 --> 01:01:14.510
I was going to be sentenced to.

01:01:14.510 --> 01:01:18.760
I negotiated my sentence down
from 63 months to 24 months,

01:01:18.760 --> 01:01:21.910
and I went off and
served my 24 months.

01:01:21.910 --> 01:01:24.940
I happened to have older
adult children at the time.

01:01:24.940 --> 01:01:27.610
But I also had a
12-year-old daughter,

01:01:27.610 --> 01:01:30.490
who's currently a sophomore
at Spelman University, Spelman

01:01:30.490 --> 01:01:31.240
College.

01:01:31.240 --> 01:01:36.320
And I also had a baby boy who
I had just given birth to,

01:01:36.320 --> 01:01:38.110
who when I walked
into that prison-- so

01:01:38.110 --> 01:01:39.830
my whole family took
me to the prison.

01:01:39.830 --> 01:01:41.500
I, again, was
treated differently

01:01:41.500 --> 01:01:45.072
than 99% of the women that
I was incarcerated with--

01:01:45.072 --> 01:01:47.530
who had not seen their children
since they were looking out

01:01:47.530 --> 01:01:50.080
the back window of a
law enforcement vehicle,

01:01:50.080 --> 01:01:52.630
and watching their babies
being shuttled away

01:01:52.630 --> 01:01:56.180
by some other state actor, OK?

01:01:56.180 --> 01:01:59.470
And then I was in
a prison with women

01:01:59.470 --> 01:02:02.510
who had not seen their
children for six, seven,

01:02:02.510 --> 01:02:06.190
eight years, if they had
seen them at all since they

01:02:06.190 --> 01:02:07.660
had been incarcerated.

01:02:07.660 --> 01:02:10.690
And the feeling of
what that's like--

01:02:10.690 --> 01:02:12.490
my baby boy was five months old.

01:02:12.490 --> 01:02:16.810
I did not come home
until he was 2.

01:02:16.810 --> 01:02:17.920
This is Santra calling in.

01:02:17.920 --> 01:02:18.670
So I'm happy then.

01:02:18.670 --> 01:02:21.130
Because I want you to hear
her voice and not mine.

01:02:21.130 --> 01:02:22.810
But those are the
very real things

01:02:22.810 --> 01:02:25.060
that women who are
incarcerated are dealing with.

01:02:25.060 --> 01:02:28.120
And not even being
able to breathe.

01:02:28.120 --> 01:02:29.631
I want to leave us
with this point,

01:02:29.631 --> 01:02:31.630
that for a woman who
leaves her children behind,

01:02:31.630 --> 01:02:34.870
we literally have to put
our children on a shelf

01:02:34.870 --> 01:02:37.480
in order to breathe to
get through our sentence.

01:02:37.480 --> 01:02:38.293
That is criminal.

01:02:42.085 --> 01:02:43.230
OK?

01:02:43.230 --> 01:02:43.730
OK.

01:02:43.730 --> 01:02:44.450
I can hear you.

01:02:44.450 --> 01:02:45.491
ANA KASPARIAN: OK, great.

01:02:45.491 --> 01:02:46.495
My name's Ana Kasparian.

01:02:46.495 --> 01:02:49.496
Thank you for taking the
time to speak with me.

01:02:49.496 --> 01:02:50.920
SANTRA RUCKER: Oh, thank you.

01:02:50.920 --> 01:02:53.904
Thank you for
allowing me to speak.

01:02:53.904 --> 01:02:56.320
ANA KASPARIAN: So we were just
having a great conversation

01:02:56.320 --> 01:03:02.500
with your daughter about some
of the obstacles to establishing

01:03:02.500 --> 01:03:04.290
a bond between the two of you.

01:03:04.290 --> 01:03:06.975
And we heard her side of
the story, her perspective.

01:03:06.975 --> 01:03:08.350
And I was hoping
that we can also

01:03:08.350 --> 01:03:11.240
hear your perspective as well.

01:03:11.240 --> 01:03:17.260
SANTRA RUCKER: OK, well, it's
like the dynamics of being

01:03:17.260 --> 01:03:20.950
incarcerated is really sensitive
when it comes to a mother

01:03:20.950 --> 01:03:25.420
and daughter
relationship, because you

01:03:25.420 --> 01:03:29.440
don't want your child to have
any type of resentment or anger

01:03:29.440 --> 01:03:33.370
because she feels
abandoned or whatever

01:03:33.370 --> 01:03:35.860
situation is due to
my circumstances that

01:03:35.860 --> 01:03:37.900
led me to come to prison.

01:03:37.900 --> 01:03:41.740
You know, these are
the things that I hope.

01:03:41.740 --> 01:03:47.050
But people might feel that
it is wrong for me to say,

01:03:47.050 --> 01:03:52.240
like I'm not really
remorseful for the things that

01:03:52.240 --> 01:03:53.930
led me to come to prison.

01:03:53.930 --> 01:03:57.490
In fact, I think that
the greater gravity was

01:03:57.490 --> 01:04:00.820
my choice and my poor choices.

01:04:00.820 --> 01:04:04.270
At the time, I didn't think
that those choices would affect

01:04:04.270 --> 01:04:09.010
my children or my family,
because I was doing the things

01:04:09.010 --> 01:04:11.930
that I love to do at the time.

01:04:11.930 --> 01:04:15.220
So at the same time, I
don't want to beat myself up

01:04:15.220 --> 01:04:18.850
for my past to make
my relationship better

01:04:18.850 --> 01:04:23.130
with my daughter because
I can't change the past.

01:04:23.130 --> 01:04:26.920
So what I'm doing is I'm trying
to benefit from the past,

01:04:26.920 --> 01:04:28.210
and move on.

01:04:28.210 --> 01:04:31.330
But in my own belief,
I believe that karma

01:04:31.330 --> 01:04:35.230
plays a big part in the
conditions of my imprisonment,

01:04:35.230 --> 01:04:37.950
because that's my
personal belief.

01:04:37.950 --> 01:04:41.430
But at the same time, I
believe that whatever you are,

01:04:41.430 --> 01:04:43.340
and whatever you are
not, you earned it

01:04:43.340 --> 01:04:46.570
whether it's good or
bad and whatever you are

01:04:46.570 --> 01:04:47.800
or whatever you are not--

01:04:47.800 --> 01:04:50.330
SPEAKER 1: This call is
from a federal prison.

01:04:50.330 --> 01:04:52.120
SANTRA RUCKER: And
right now I feel like I

01:04:52.120 --> 01:04:54.430
have changed dramatically.

01:04:54.430 --> 01:04:57.700
And I have [INAUDIBLE] raised
my level of consciousness

01:04:57.700 --> 01:05:02.320
to a higher vibration so that
I can be able to be active with

01:05:02.320 --> 01:05:06.310
my daughter, to show love for
my daughter, to do the things--

01:05:06.310 --> 01:05:08.530
not trying to make
up for my past,

01:05:08.530 --> 01:05:10.600
but the things that
a mother would do.

01:05:10.600 --> 01:05:14.500
I try to do these things over
the phone, through the emails,

01:05:14.500 --> 01:05:17.890
through visitation, sending
things to my daughter

01:05:17.890 --> 01:05:20.350
to show her that I
love her and that I

01:05:20.350 --> 01:05:21.960
am sorry to not be there.

01:05:21.960 --> 01:05:25.662
So in my absence, I do
things from my heart.

01:05:25.662 --> 01:05:29.172
[SOBBING]

01:05:29.172 --> 01:05:30.880
ANA KASPARIAN: Kendia
talked a little bit

01:05:30.880 --> 01:05:35.710
about what it was like to
have physical contact with you

01:05:35.710 --> 01:05:37.420
for the first time.

01:05:37.420 --> 01:05:42.360
I'm curious to hear what
that felt like for you.

01:05:42.360 --> 01:05:45.820
SANTRA RUCKER: It
felt kind of awkward.

01:05:45.820 --> 01:05:50.930
Because you don't
know what to say.

01:05:50.930 --> 01:05:53.330
Like I wanted to
be a mother, but I

01:05:53.330 --> 01:05:58.040
didn't want to act too
overprotective, because

01:05:58.040 --> 01:06:01.120
of my absence,
due to my absence.

01:06:01.120 --> 01:06:04.450
But I wanted to show her that,
yeah, true, I am your mother.

01:06:04.450 --> 01:06:07.000
And I want you to
be open with me.

01:06:07.000 --> 01:06:09.160
I want you to
understand me, and I

01:06:09.160 --> 01:06:12.490
want you to learn who I
am through visitation,

01:06:12.490 --> 01:06:16.360
because we only would
talk over the phone.

01:06:16.360 --> 01:06:21.970
And it was kind of a bonding
time, where I looked at her

01:06:21.970 --> 01:06:24.540
and she looked at me.

01:06:24.540 --> 01:06:27.180
But at the same time, I
didn't know what to say.

01:06:27.180 --> 01:06:30.910
I didn't know if I
should touch her.

01:06:30.910 --> 01:06:35.650
I didn't know if
she would reject me.

01:06:35.650 --> 01:06:40.365
So I watch how other
people in the visitation

01:06:40.365 --> 01:06:43.090
interacted with their children.

01:06:43.090 --> 01:06:44.800
So that I can learn
that, OK, this

01:06:44.800 --> 01:06:46.620
is all right to hold her hand.

01:06:46.620 --> 01:06:50.830
This is all right to do this,
or this is all right to do that.

01:06:50.830 --> 01:06:51.910
But it was pretty--

01:06:51.910 --> 01:06:55.420
it was more emotional
for me when I came back.

01:06:55.420 --> 01:06:59.600
Because I was, like, I wish
I would have said this.

01:06:59.600 --> 01:07:01.600
I wish I would have said that.

01:07:01.600 --> 01:07:04.810
And when she came to
visit me, my other family

01:07:04.810 --> 01:07:06.690
was there-- my
sisters, my nephews,

01:07:06.690 --> 01:07:09.650
so I couldn't be
as personal as I

01:07:09.650 --> 01:07:12.730
wanted to be and say the
things that I really wanted to.

01:07:12.730 --> 01:07:14.130
Because it was so long.

01:07:14.130 --> 01:07:16.345
It had been 10
years before I had

01:07:16.345 --> 01:07:19.690
seen my family and my daughter.

01:07:19.690 --> 01:07:22.080
So it was just really hard.

01:07:22.080 --> 01:07:27.250
It's even harder when you have
to come back from visitation.

01:07:27.250 --> 01:07:30.500
You know and to be around total
strangers that you don't love,

01:07:30.500 --> 01:07:32.000
and that you don't know.

01:07:32.000 --> 01:07:34.000
You know?

01:07:34.000 --> 01:07:35.200
So, I'm sorry.

01:07:35.200 --> 01:07:35.867
Can you hear me?

01:07:35.867 --> 01:07:37.324
ANA KASPARIAN: Yes,
I can hear you.

01:07:37.324 --> 01:07:39.100
Thank you so much for
sharing your story.

01:07:39.100 --> 01:07:40.240
It's very moving.

01:07:40.240 --> 01:07:42.490
And everyone-- there
are several members

01:07:42.490 --> 01:07:45.760
of the audience that are in
tears right now over what

01:07:45.760 --> 01:07:47.410
you're saying.

01:07:47.410 --> 01:07:51.050
So Kendia has done incredible
things with her life.

01:07:51.050 --> 01:07:53.990
She is a sophomore at the
University of Virginia.

01:07:53.990 --> 01:07:56.710
She's studying majors
that I can't even

01:07:56.710 --> 01:07:57.940
wrap my brain around.

01:07:57.940 --> 01:08:00.620
She's an incredible young woman.

01:08:00.620 --> 01:08:04.216
So what are your
feelings about that?

01:08:04.216 --> 01:08:06.270
SANTRA RUCKER: I'm very proud.

01:08:06.270 --> 01:08:10.810
And I feel, sometimes I wonder
if my absence made her life

01:08:10.810 --> 01:08:12.580
better.

01:08:12.580 --> 01:08:17.450
Because she was raised by
the same parents as me.

01:08:17.450 --> 01:08:19.580
That's my mom and dad.

01:08:19.580 --> 01:08:23.830
So I knew she would be a
good person, a loving person.

01:08:23.830 --> 01:08:26.439
You know, but I'm glad.

01:08:26.439 --> 01:08:29.439
I feel like she's the
better side of me.

01:08:29.439 --> 01:08:30.120
You know?

01:08:30.120 --> 01:08:32.700
Like, I feel like
I couldn't make it.

01:08:32.700 --> 01:08:33.609
And I didn't make it.

01:08:33.609 --> 01:08:37.229
And I wasn't successful
like I wanted to be.

01:08:37.229 --> 01:08:39.580
So I figure that
with her doing it,

01:08:39.580 --> 01:08:42.580
it makes me feel proud
because she is me.

01:08:42.580 --> 01:08:44.170
She's a part of me.

01:08:44.170 --> 01:08:47.560
And I knew that she
would do great things.

01:08:47.560 --> 01:08:51.620
And I just always knew that she
had she has great potential.

01:08:51.620 --> 01:08:53.770
So I wasn't shocked
that she would

01:08:53.770 --> 01:08:57.460
be as productive and intelligent
as she is in everything

01:08:57.460 --> 01:08:59.479
that she's displaying.

01:08:59.479 --> 01:09:00.210
You know?

01:09:00.210 --> 01:09:04.439
So I knew that she would
be all right, you know?

01:09:04.439 --> 01:09:08.710
But I often wonder, if
I was home to raise her,

01:09:08.710 --> 01:09:12.700
would she have taken that route?

01:09:12.700 --> 01:09:17.910
Maybe my poor choices would have
infected her and affected her.

01:09:17.910 --> 01:09:21.750
You know, so I was kind of
glad to be absent in a way

01:09:21.750 --> 01:09:24.107
so that she could have
the perfect life that I

01:09:24.107 --> 01:09:25.061
didn't have.

01:09:27.340 --> 01:09:28.840
ANA KASPARIAN:
Kendia shared with us

01:09:28.840 --> 01:09:32.420
that you, fortunately,
finally, have a release date.

01:09:32.420 --> 01:09:37.120
So I'm curious what
you maybe fantasize

01:09:37.120 --> 01:09:39.819
about doing with your family,
doing with Kendia when

01:09:39.819 --> 01:09:42.670
you are released.

01:09:42.670 --> 01:09:44.800
SANTRA RUCKER:
Well, a lot of times

01:09:44.800 --> 01:09:46.960
I see, I listen to a lot
of prisoners that leave.

01:09:46.960 --> 01:09:48.590
They make big plans.

01:09:48.590 --> 01:09:51.040
And that folder seems
to be somewhere lost

01:09:51.040 --> 01:09:53.410
in the attic when they get home.

01:09:53.410 --> 01:09:55.930
But I know one of
the biggest problems

01:09:55.930 --> 01:09:59.750
that my family faces
is financial problems.

01:09:59.750 --> 01:10:02.710
So I've been in
here studying how

01:10:02.710 --> 01:10:05.440
to learn the different
grants that's available

01:10:05.440 --> 01:10:08.410
when I get out, the different
loans that they have

01:10:08.410 --> 01:10:13.120
for convicted felons, and try
to use those things to open up

01:10:13.120 --> 01:10:16.690
a restaurant where my
family can benefit from.

01:10:16.690 --> 01:10:20.871
And I think finances is of
great importance for everybody

01:10:20.871 --> 01:10:21.370
in life.

01:10:21.370 --> 01:10:24.790
Because without money, you
can't really do anything.

01:10:24.790 --> 01:10:27.790
And I believe that we can
come together as a family

01:10:27.790 --> 01:10:32.050
and be productive and have
fun and go places and travel.

01:10:32.050 --> 01:10:35.230
And do the things, not
to make up for lost time,

01:10:35.230 --> 01:10:38.120
but for the now.

01:10:38.120 --> 01:10:40.640
And so I hope to have a
restaurant when I get out.

01:10:40.640 --> 01:10:42.040
I took culinary art.

01:10:42.040 --> 01:10:46.210
And I taught Kendia how to
bake over this telephone.

01:10:46.210 --> 01:10:49.430
So I'm hoping that I can do
that, not just for myself,

01:10:49.430 --> 01:10:51.430
but for my family.

01:10:51.430 --> 01:10:53.680
That's one of the main things.

01:10:53.680 --> 01:10:57.860
And I just want to be a
mother to my daughter.

01:10:57.860 --> 01:11:01.545
And those things I have tried
to do from prison, which

01:11:01.545 --> 01:11:04.500
I have great limitations here.

01:11:04.500 --> 01:11:07.630
But I believe when I get
home, it could be better.

01:11:07.630 --> 01:11:10.540
But it depends on my daughter.

01:11:10.540 --> 01:11:13.840
Because if my daughter
feels that I abandoned

01:11:13.840 --> 01:11:16.990
her or she feels any
resentment, or she feels

01:11:16.990 --> 01:11:20.560
any anger towards my
absence, then it's

01:11:20.560 --> 01:11:22.960
going to be quite difficult
for me to do the things

01:11:22.960 --> 01:11:26.990
that I would love to do and
have the great desire to do.

01:11:26.990 --> 01:11:31.600
But it has to be a
mutual agreement.

01:11:31.600 --> 01:11:34.630
And I just hope to be the
most successful person

01:11:34.630 --> 01:11:35.890
that I can be.

01:11:35.890 --> 01:11:40.570
I want to be the person
that I was in 1999 before I

01:11:40.570 --> 01:11:42.160
came to prison.

01:11:42.160 --> 01:11:43.540
So I have high goals.

01:11:43.540 --> 01:11:44.710
I have high standards.

01:11:44.710 --> 01:11:46.280
I have high principles.

01:11:46.280 --> 01:11:49.940
And I believe, that with
God being in my life,

01:11:49.940 --> 01:11:53.680
that these things are
manifesting before I even

01:11:53.680 --> 01:11:55.960
come home, you know.

01:11:55.960 --> 01:11:58.210
So I'm not waiting
for the manifestation

01:11:58.210 --> 01:12:01.170
to take place when
I walk out the door.

01:12:01.170 --> 01:12:02.695
I'm preparing it now.

01:12:02.695 --> 01:12:04.630
Through my provision,
through my prayers,

01:12:04.630 --> 01:12:08.080
and through what I know,
which is my belief.

01:12:08.080 --> 01:12:12.410
But I believe that we were
all one, and we'll be one.

01:12:12.410 --> 01:12:15.520
It's kind of hard to be
one from prison, because

01:12:15.520 --> 01:12:18.460
of the barricades that we face.

01:12:18.460 --> 01:12:22.000
But hopefully, I hope that,
through my mom and dad,

01:12:22.000 --> 01:12:23.560
that the love that
they instilled

01:12:23.560 --> 01:12:26.020
in me, the human
compassion that they

01:12:26.020 --> 01:12:27.900
instilled in me,
that they instilled

01:12:27.900 --> 01:12:29.700
those things into Kendia.

01:12:29.700 --> 01:12:34.710
So when I get home, everything
will be as if I never left.

01:12:34.710 --> 01:12:36.580
And that's how I would like it.

01:12:36.580 --> 01:12:41.540
That's how I want it to
be when I touch home.

01:12:41.540 --> 01:12:42.330
I'm sorry.

01:12:42.330 --> 01:12:43.550
I get a little emotional.

01:12:43.550 --> 01:12:44.675
ANA KASPARIAN: No, it's OK.

01:12:44.675 --> 01:12:48.730
SANTRA RUCKER: But you know,
but you know, I'm sorry?

01:12:48.730 --> 01:12:50.880
ANA KASPARIAN: No, go ahead.

01:12:50.880 --> 01:12:53.310
SANTRA RUCKER: But you know,
I understand where I am.

01:12:53.310 --> 01:12:55.760
I understand the
circumstances of my life.

01:12:55.760 --> 01:12:58.960
And the events that took
shape to get me here,

01:12:58.960 --> 01:13:01.510
and the people who
I gravitated to.

01:13:01.510 --> 01:13:06.154
But during that era of the '80s,
that was like the 'in' thing--

01:13:06.154 --> 01:13:08.070
SPEAKER 1: This call is
from a federal prison.

01:13:08.070 --> 01:13:10.400
SANTRA RUCKER: --what was
happening at the time.

01:13:10.400 --> 01:13:10.750
ANA KASPARIAN: Miss--

01:13:10.750 --> 01:13:12.541
SANTRA RUCKER: And the
decision that I made

01:13:12.541 --> 01:13:15.080
were what I thought
were good decisions.

01:13:15.080 --> 01:13:19.560
It was just normal and typical
for people my age in that area.

01:13:19.560 --> 01:13:22.200
ANA KASPARIAN: Miss Santra
Rucker, sorry to interrupt you.

01:13:22.200 --> 01:13:24.710
I just want to let you know
that we might lose you soon.

01:13:24.710 --> 01:13:27.590
And if we do, I just want
to thank you for your time.

01:13:27.590 --> 01:13:31.240
And thank you for speaking
with us and sharing your story.

01:13:31.240 --> 01:13:33.410
SANTRA RUCKER: No, and I
thank you for allowing me.

01:13:33.410 --> 01:13:36.110
I thank you for having
human compassion,

01:13:36.110 --> 01:13:38.120
to be able to be a
sensitive audience.

01:13:38.120 --> 01:13:41.050
That-- just take this
as a shift of awareness

01:13:41.050 --> 01:13:42.710
and know that, I
just know everything

01:13:42.710 --> 01:13:45.410
is going to be all right just
from speaking to you all.

01:13:45.410 --> 01:13:47.520
And I think you all can
make a big difference.

01:13:47.520 --> 01:13:51.860
And I thank you
again, I really do.

01:13:51.860 --> 01:13:53.990
Because you have an
influential power

01:13:53.990 --> 01:13:55.760
that can change your life.

01:13:55.760 --> 01:13:58.800
And just from the audience
being there today,

01:13:58.800 --> 01:14:04.130
this shows that everybody's
destiny and fate can change.

01:14:04.130 --> 01:14:06.740
And you could be really
influential and encouraging

01:14:06.740 --> 01:14:08.780
to prisoners as well.

01:14:08.780 --> 01:14:11.290
Because it's difficult.
It's very difficult.

01:14:11.290 --> 01:14:14.840
It's difficult for our children
and for us as prisoners.

01:14:14.840 --> 01:14:17.380
But I thank you as well.

01:14:17.380 --> 01:14:18.972
Start crying.

01:14:18.972 --> 01:14:20.930
ANA KASPARIAN: You have
no reason to apologize.

01:14:20.930 --> 01:14:23.790
Please take care of yourself,
and thank you again.

01:14:23.790 --> 01:14:25.200
SANTRA RUCKER: OK, thank you.

01:14:25.200 --> 01:14:27.234
[APPLAUSE]

01:14:27.234 --> 01:14:28.650
MALIKA SAADA SAAR:
Typical Google,

01:14:28.650 --> 01:14:32.677
where I said working at Google's
like understanding jazz.

01:14:32.677 --> 01:14:34.260
That you know
somebody's riffing here.

01:14:34.260 --> 01:14:35.360
Somebody's riffing there.

01:14:35.360 --> 01:14:38.100
So this is also, this
is a very Google-y,

01:14:38.100 --> 01:14:41.670
because this is very
much like an act of jazz.

01:14:41.670 --> 01:14:47.910
I know that it's a lot to hold
all of the ways in which we are

01:14:47.910 --> 01:14:50.910
bearing witness and
being proximate to what

01:14:50.910 --> 01:14:53.040
the costs of
incarceration has been

01:14:53.040 --> 01:14:56.040
to our mothers
and our daughters.

01:14:56.040 --> 01:14:58.980
But I think it's
important to stay present.

01:14:58.980 --> 01:15:03.770
Because it's not only
an issue of placing

01:15:03.770 --> 01:15:07.230
and overcriminalization
and relegating our women

01:15:07.230 --> 01:15:10.770
and mothers to incarceration.

01:15:10.770 --> 01:15:15.150
It is also a narrative of what
is happening to our girls.

01:15:15.150 --> 01:15:18.570
And there's a lot of
conversation around the school

01:15:18.570 --> 01:15:20.250
to prison pipeline.

01:15:20.250 --> 01:15:24.330
But there's not conversation
around how the girls fit

01:15:24.330 --> 01:15:25.860
into that pipeline.

01:15:25.860 --> 01:15:29.850
And how in many ways, the
girls have a separate pipeline

01:15:29.850 --> 01:15:32.160
into the juvenile
justice system.

01:15:32.160 --> 01:15:34.980
We wanted this panel
to be able to surface

01:15:34.980 --> 01:15:39.600
some of the lived experiences
and the lived expertise

01:15:39.600 --> 01:15:42.300
around what is
happening to our girls.

01:15:42.300 --> 01:15:44.190
So if we could
start with Charity.

01:15:44.190 --> 01:15:46.410
If you could each introduce
yourselves and and then

01:15:46.410 --> 01:15:47.244
we'll talk about it.

01:15:47.244 --> 01:15:49.076
CHARITY CHANDLER-COLE:
Yes, hello, everyone.

01:15:49.076 --> 01:15:50.490
My name is Charity
Chandler-Cole.

01:15:50.490 --> 01:15:52.530
I am a social justice
advocate, and I

01:15:52.530 --> 01:15:55.170
advocate for various
social justice

01:15:55.170 --> 01:15:57.780
issues such as criminal
justice reform, human sex

01:15:57.780 --> 01:15:59.480
trafficking, and foster care.

01:15:59.480 --> 01:16:01.230
And I sit on various
boards and committees

01:16:01.230 --> 01:16:03.864
throughout the state that
address these issues.

01:16:03.864 --> 01:16:05.280
MICHELLE DIAZ: Hi,
good afternoon.

01:16:05.280 --> 01:16:06.390
My name is Michelle Diaz.

01:16:06.390 --> 01:16:08.730
I'm an advisor
for the task force

01:16:08.730 --> 01:16:10.530
in ending girls'
incarceration in New York

01:16:10.530 --> 01:16:12.930
City for Vera Institute.

01:16:12.930 --> 01:16:14.850
SARAH ZARBA: Hi,
my name is Sarah.

01:16:14.850 --> 01:16:16.770
I'm actually also part
of that task force

01:16:16.770 --> 01:16:19.210
and I'm also working at the
Vera Institute of Justice

01:16:19.210 --> 01:16:21.045
in New York City.

01:16:21.045 --> 01:16:22.920
MALIKA SAADA SAAR: So
beginning with Charity,

01:16:22.920 --> 01:16:25.830
if you could each
talk about how you

01:16:25.830 --> 01:16:28.650
were placed into
the juvenile justice

01:16:28.650 --> 01:16:30.354
system and your
experiences there.

01:16:30.354 --> 01:16:31.770
CHARITY CHANDLER-COLE:
Absolutely.

01:16:31.770 --> 01:16:36.630
So at the age of 10, my mother
was going through a divorce,

01:16:36.630 --> 01:16:38.520
and she got breast
cancer at the same time.

01:16:38.520 --> 01:16:40.980
And she pretty much
afterwards went

01:16:40.980 --> 01:16:43.360
through a state of depression,
stress, and anxiety.

01:16:43.360 --> 01:16:47.400
And she basically just gave up
on the six children she had,

01:16:47.400 --> 01:16:49.380
and we kind of had to
fend for ourselves.

01:16:49.380 --> 01:16:51.780
My older sister entered
the juvenile justice

01:16:51.780 --> 01:16:53.800
and foster care system
at the age of 12.

01:16:53.800 --> 01:16:56.352
So when I was 14, I
was the big sister.

01:16:56.352 --> 01:16:57.060
I was the mother.

01:16:57.060 --> 01:17:00.630
And I did everything I could
to provide for my four younger

01:17:00.630 --> 01:17:03.890
siblings while we
were on welfare.

01:17:03.890 --> 01:17:08.460
At the age of 16, I got caught
stealing underwear from Ross.

01:17:08.460 --> 01:17:09.870
Nothing cute, it was Hanes.

01:17:09.870 --> 01:17:13.230
You know, from a
sibling, so it was simply

01:17:13.230 --> 01:17:15.900
out of a pure desire
of need for my family.

01:17:15.900 --> 01:17:19.140
And the police called
my mother to pick me up,

01:17:19.140 --> 01:17:20.910
and she said, take her to jail.

01:17:20.910 --> 01:17:21.570
And they did.

01:17:21.570 --> 01:17:24.750
And my mom at the time used the
foster care system and juvenile

01:17:24.750 --> 01:17:28.800
justice system to kind of one
by one get rid of the children

01:17:28.800 --> 01:17:32.040
that she no longer desired
to have at the time.

01:17:32.040 --> 01:17:33.790
It wasn't because she
just didn't love us,

01:17:33.790 --> 01:17:35.581
she just didn't know
how to take care of us

01:17:35.581 --> 01:17:37.650
any longer after
what she experienced.

01:17:40.710 --> 01:17:42.990
After there, I spent the
next two years in and out

01:17:42.990 --> 01:17:45.480
of juvenile hall
and foster care.

01:17:45.480 --> 01:17:47.850
No one at any point
asked my mother

01:17:47.850 --> 01:17:49.850
why do you want your
child to go to jail?

01:17:49.850 --> 01:17:51.870
You know, why is she
stealing underwear?

01:17:51.870 --> 01:17:53.850
What situation is
happening in your family

01:17:53.850 --> 01:17:57.630
to cause your daughter
to steal underwear?

01:17:57.630 --> 01:18:00.450
Here are some alternatives
to incarceration.

01:18:00.450 --> 01:18:03.422
I was just-- they said,
OK, they hung up the phone.

01:18:03.422 --> 01:18:05.880
They handcuffed me, put me in
the back of their patrol car,

01:18:05.880 --> 01:18:08.800
booked me, and took
me to juvenile hall.

01:18:08.800 --> 01:18:13.530
I, at that very moment, realized
that my life had zero value,

01:18:13.530 --> 01:18:16.470
and that I could easily
be discarded and put away.

01:18:16.470 --> 01:18:18.630
My experience in
the juvenile justice

01:18:18.630 --> 01:18:21.660
system and the foster
care system were horrid.

01:18:21.660 --> 01:18:23.190
And I experienced
and was exposed

01:18:23.190 --> 01:18:26.250
to things I probably would
have never experienced

01:18:26.250 --> 01:18:29.160
living in the streets in a
gang-infested and drug-infested

01:18:29.160 --> 01:18:30.690
neighborhood.

01:18:30.690 --> 01:18:33.000
Any ounce of self-esteem
and confidence

01:18:33.000 --> 01:18:36.750
I have went out the window,
and I was constantly degraded.

01:18:36.750 --> 01:18:40.590
I felt enslaved, and I
was psychologically abused

01:18:40.590 --> 01:18:43.300
and sexually exploited
while in the system.

01:18:43.300 --> 01:18:45.450
And because of
what I experienced

01:18:45.450 --> 01:18:49.080
and because of the feeling of
abandoning the four siblings

01:18:49.080 --> 01:18:51.720
that needed me-- who was going
to feed them and take care

01:18:51.720 --> 01:18:55.280
of them, who's going to walk
them to school the next day--

01:18:55.280 --> 01:18:58.710
just feeling completely
just abandoned, alone,

01:18:58.710 --> 01:19:01.860
and worthless, I left
the system determined

01:19:01.860 --> 01:19:04.770
that I was going to work my
ass off for the rest of my life

01:19:04.770 --> 01:19:05.590
to help change it.

01:19:05.590 --> 01:19:13.820
[APPLAUSE]

01:19:13.820 --> 01:19:16.250
MICHELLE DIAZ: Well, everything
started when I was 13.

01:19:16.250 --> 01:19:18.680
I'm only 20.

01:19:18.680 --> 01:19:20.600
I came here.

01:19:20.600 --> 01:19:23.030
I did not speak English
at all, and my mother

01:19:23.030 --> 01:19:25.730
was working seven days a week.

01:19:25.730 --> 01:19:29.640
And the only person that I
knew was my mother, and then

01:19:29.640 --> 01:19:30.440
nobody else.

01:19:30.440 --> 01:19:36.320
When I went to school, my
school class was only Spanish,

01:19:36.320 --> 01:19:39.710
so I didn't really
learn English at all.

01:19:39.710 --> 01:19:45.530
And when I was going
to school, I was shy.

01:19:45.530 --> 01:19:47.450
I didn't talk to the other kids.

01:19:47.450 --> 01:19:50.450
And then one time, I just
went to McDonald's, and I

01:19:50.450 --> 01:19:51.530
met this guy.

01:19:51.530 --> 01:19:54.230
And you know, he was
much older than me--

01:19:54.230 --> 01:19:55.910
keeping in mind
that I was only 13--

01:19:55.910 --> 01:19:58.220
and he talked to me.

01:19:58.220 --> 01:20:01.370
And you know, like I
said, my mother never

01:20:01.370 --> 01:20:02.990
had the time to be with me.

01:20:02.990 --> 01:20:07.560
And the reason why I
moved to United States,

01:20:07.560 --> 01:20:10.580
it was because I wanted to
have that mother and daughter

01:20:10.580 --> 01:20:15.240
relationship, because my mother
all the time, she was working.

01:20:15.240 --> 01:20:19.910
And then this guy
who treat me "right,"

01:20:19.910 --> 01:20:21.770
quote unquote, who
pay attention to me,

01:20:21.770 --> 01:20:24.800
make me being the
idea of being in love.

01:20:24.800 --> 01:20:27.650
And one time, like
I was going crazy--

01:20:27.650 --> 01:20:30.600
the only person that I
really pay attention to--

01:20:30.600 --> 01:20:32.320
and one time we just
went to the mall

01:20:32.320 --> 01:20:36.620
and he stole a tee shirt
from JC Penney, 25 bucks.

01:20:36.620 --> 01:20:38.730
And we got caught.

01:20:38.730 --> 01:20:41.060
And he was like, oh,
Michelle, take the charge.

01:20:41.060 --> 01:20:41.750
Take the charge.

01:20:41.750 --> 01:20:43.374
They're not going to
do nothing to you.

01:20:43.374 --> 01:20:44.180
You're under age.

01:20:44.180 --> 01:20:47.720
And I was like, no, it's not
my fault. And he was like,

01:20:47.720 --> 01:20:49.130
oh, he started arguing with me.

01:20:49.130 --> 01:20:51.230
And of course, you don't want
to be mad with the person--

01:20:51.230 --> 01:20:53.810
you don't want the person to
be mad at you, the only person

01:20:53.810 --> 01:20:55.310
who's paying attention to you.

01:20:55.310 --> 01:20:57.260
So I said, yeah,
I take the charge.

01:20:57.260 --> 01:20:59.990
And then I will spend
the night at the prison.

01:20:59.990 --> 01:21:01.772
And then my mother
came and took me.

01:21:01.772 --> 01:21:02.980
And the next day, I run away.

01:21:02.980 --> 01:21:04.370
I went back to him.

01:21:04.370 --> 01:21:06.740
And this was like
a family court.

01:21:06.740 --> 01:21:10.710
And my lawyer was like, oh,
Michelle, just take the charge.

01:21:10.710 --> 01:21:12.620
It's going to be 18
months of probation.

01:21:12.620 --> 01:21:15.822
And of course, I did
not know nothing.

01:21:15.822 --> 01:21:16.780
I didn't speak English.

01:21:16.780 --> 01:21:19.550
My lawyer was only
speak English.

01:21:19.550 --> 01:21:21.230
So it was really, really hard.

01:21:21.230 --> 01:21:23.960
The interpreter was there
only for like two minutes.

01:21:23.960 --> 01:21:26.587
And I was like,
yeah, sure, whatever.

01:21:26.587 --> 01:21:28.045
And then one thing
lead to another.

01:21:28.045 --> 01:21:29.720
I started missing school.

01:21:29.720 --> 01:21:31.850
I got pregnant at 15.

01:21:31.850 --> 01:21:35.640
I was in seventh grade, and
like all these things crash.

01:21:35.640 --> 01:21:38.120
I run away.

01:21:38.120 --> 01:21:40.880
Got a warrant and a
violation of probation.

01:21:40.880 --> 01:21:43.460
I went back because I always
wanted to do the right thing.

01:21:43.460 --> 01:21:44.780
I always wanted to be somebody.

01:21:44.780 --> 01:21:47.690
But never nobody
asked me why I was

01:21:47.690 --> 01:21:50.360
doing what I was doing, what I
wanted to be, where am I going,

01:21:50.360 --> 01:21:52.040
what is my future, right?

01:21:52.040 --> 01:21:54.740
In the end, I went back.

01:21:54.740 --> 01:21:58.610
I try, I try to do things right.

01:21:58.610 --> 01:22:00.440
But there was no support at all.

01:22:00.440 --> 01:22:03.050
And I was a teenage mom.

01:22:03.050 --> 01:22:07.460
And I dropped out of middle
school, never graduated.

01:22:07.460 --> 01:22:11.180
And I couldn't
take it any longer.

01:22:11.180 --> 01:22:14.870
And my probation officer
violated me again.

01:22:14.870 --> 01:22:16.220
I ran away.

01:22:16.220 --> 01:22:18.710
Then the judge said
that I was a runner,

01:22:18.710 --> 01:22:22.820
and he put me in a secure
facility in New York.

01:22:22.820 --> 01:22:26.600
And I spent like, about eight,
six to eight months in there.

01:22:26.600 --> 01:22:29.750
And after that I went
to a group home close

01:22:29.750 --> 01:22:32.090
to home, a secure facility.

01:22:32.090 --> 01:22:37.070
And it was when I started
speaking English was when

01:22:37.070 --> 01:22:39.230
I was in this secure facility.

01:22:39.230 --> 01:22:41.075
Because nobody spoke
Spanish over there.

01:22:41.075 --> 01:22:43.790
But I could put together
the images, what I see,

01:22:43.790 --> 01:22:44.870
what I hear.

01:22:44.870 --> 01:22:45.950
And it was amazing.

01:22:45.950 --> 01:22:48.691
But the first time I was
there, I couldn't eat.

01:22:48.691 --> 01:22:49.190
Why?

01:22:49.190 --> 01:22:51.350
Because I didn't like the food.

01:22:51.350 --> 01:22:53.360
I just, I couldn't take it.

01:22:53.360 --> 01:22:58.620
Nobody wanted how I lost 10, 20
pounds in a month over there.

01:22:58.620 --> 01:23:04.820
And when I got out, I spent
two months in a group home.

01:23:04.820 --> 01:23:06.650
But I was always scared.

01:23:06.650 --> 01:23:09.410
People talk about Rikers
Island, the secure facility,

01:23:09.410 --> 01:23:11.030
and how bad it is.

01:23:11.030 --> 01:23:13.370
And I was like, damn, I
don't want to go there.

01:23:13.370 --> 01:23:15.060
I was so afraid,
because at that time,

01:23:15.060 --> 01:23:16.910
I didn't have papers at all.

01:23:16.910 --> 01:23:19.880
And then I was like,
if I do something,

01:23:19.880 --> 01:23:21.000
and there was this girl.

01:23:21.000 --> 01:23:22.580
She was 15 and
tried to fight me.

01:23:22.580 --> 01:23:24.220
And I was like, I
can't get into her.

01:23:24.220 --> 01:23:25.982
Because what is next?

01:23:25.982 --> 01:23:27.940
Next thing you know, I'm
going to get deported.

01:23:27.940 --> 01:23:29.660
And I can't do that,
I have a child.

01:23:29.660 --> 01:23:30.560
And I want something.

01:23:30.560 --> 01:23:32.790
I wanted to do
something with my life.

01:23:32.790 --> 01:23:37.190
And then I got moved to the
foster care system, where I

01:23:37.190 --> 01:23:38.660
spent about two years in there.

01:23:38.660 --> 01:23:40.090
And I met this amazing work.

01:23:40.090 --> 01:23:41.930
And then I met my mentor.

01:23:41.930 --> 01:23:44.030
And everything started
being put together.

01:23:44.030 --> 01:23:46.100
I went to school,
got my GED, and then

01:23:46.100 --> 01:23:49.034
when I was going to
school, it's when

01:23:49.034 --> 01:23:50.450
I got to sit down
with people that

01:23:50.450 --> 01:23:53.630
had to spend decades of
their lives in prison

01:23:53.630 --> 01:23:55.460
and how much they suffer.

01:23:55.460 --> 01:23:57.710
And then I would ask them,
why you didn't do something

01:23:57.710 --> 01:23:58.209
about it.

01:23:58.209 --> 01:24:00.420
Look, but no-- they're
waiting for the other person.

01:24:00.420 --> 01:24:02.570
And then I decided
to be that person.

01:24:02.570 --> 01:24:07.580
And if there's one thing
that I have to go back to,

01:24:07.580 --> 01:24:08.690
I wouldn't change it.

01:24:08.690 --> 01:24:12.170
Even though I would love to
have been for my daughter

01:24:12.170 --> 01:24:12.810
all this time.

01:24:12.810 --> 01:24:16.470
But I am where I am because
of everything that I had done.

01:24:16.470 --> 01:24:18.120
And I'm liking myself.

01:24:18.120 --> 01:24:19.600
I'm starting to love myself.

01:24:19.600 --> 01:24:26.640
[APPLAUSE]

01:24:26.640 --> 01:24:29.220
SARAH ZARBA: Just listening
to you ladies, I mean,

01:24:29.220 --> 01:24:30.900
it's just echoing
the same thing.

01:24:30.900 --> 01:24:34.830
I was 14 the first time that I
was involved with the system.

01:24:34.830 --> 01:24:36.930
And I mean, I was in
the back of the police

01:24:36.930 --> 01:24:39.180
car, 14 years old,
handcuffed, because

01:24:39.180 --> 01:24:41.100
of a fight that
happened at home.

01:24:41.100 --> 01:24:44.860
And my parents, I mean,
they stayed together.

01:24:44.860 --> 01:24:46.500
They're still together today.

01:24:46.500 --> 01:24:51.570
And coming from Long Island,
which is a suburban community,

01:24:51.570 --> 01:24:54.540
that's not something
that is the norm there.

01:24:54.540 --> 01:24:57.060
So parents of limited resources
on what to [INAUDIBLE],

01:24:57.060 --> 01:24:59.400
like, what do you do when
your child is out of control?

01:24:59.400 --> 01:25:02.700
Or what do you do when your
kid is skipping school?

01:25:02.700 --> 01:25:04.680
And in that case,
the cops were called,

01:25:04.680 --> 01:25:06.330
and I was placed in handcuffs.

01:25:06.330 --> 01:25:09.150
And the whole ride, at 14, too.

01:25:09.150 --> 01:25:10.950
I didn't even know
where I was going.

01:25:10.950 --> 01:25:15.890
And I ended up getting
taken to the family court.

01:25:15.890 --> 01:25:17.520
And that there was
a petition filed,

01:25:17.520 --> 01:25:19.540
a PINS petition at the time.

01:25:19.540 --> 01:25:21.270
And it was just
so chaotic that I

01:25:21.270 --> 01:25:22.824
had no idea what was happening.

01:25:22.824 --> 01:25:24.990
I just thought, well, I
must have committed a crime.

01:25:24.990 --> 01:25:26.823
I must have done something
wrong because I'm

01:25:26.823 --> 01:25:28.050
in the back of this car.

01:25:28.050 --> 01:25:33.420
And that just continued on
from age 14 on until 18.

01:25:33.420 --> 01:25:35.820
And I just kept going
back and forth to court.

01:25:35.820 --> 01:25:39.810
Also in school, I was
considered homeless

01:25:39.810 --> 01:25:42.030
because I didn't live at home.

01:25:42.030 --> 01:25:46.710
And I was actually kicked out
of three different high schools.

01:25:46.710 --> 01:25:47.970
And it was very chaotic.

01:25:47.970 --> 01:25:50.100
And people in the
school district

01:25:50.100 --> 01:25:52.620
didn't understand
why I was acting out.

01:25:52.620 --> 01:25:54.125
I was disrupting class.

01:25:54.125 --> 01:25:57.420
I was disrupting everything
that came into my path,

01:25:57.420 --> 01:26:00.660
I just destroyed
it because I didn't

01:26:00.660 --> 01:26:02.010
have any support at home.

01:26:02.010 --> 01:26:04.890
And everything seemed that
it was fine from the outside,

01:26:04.890 --> 01:26:07.080
but no one was asking
those questions to find out

01:26:07.080 --> 01:26:08.670
what was really going on.

01:26:08.670 --> 01:26:10.650
And there was, at
the time, there

01:26:10.650 --> 01:26:13.590
is a probation officer stationed
in the school district.

01:26:13.590 --> 01:26:17.640
And she would-- full uniform,
school resource officer is what

01:26:17.640 --> 01:26:18.750
they're called now--

01:26:18.750 --> 01:26:21.150
and she would come to class,
make sure I was in class.

01:26:21.150 --> 01:26:24.300
And all my classmates
thought that I was a problem.

01:26:24.300 --> 01:26:26.850
No one wanted to
hang out with me.

01:26:26.850 --> 01:26:28.290
My friends, their
parents wouldn't

01:26:28.290 --> 01:26:32.190
allow them to hang out with me
because I was a problem child.

01:26:32.190 --> 01:26:35.490
So that continued,
and eventually I

01:26:35.490 --> 01:26:36.990
ended up in independent living.

01:26:36.990 --> 01:26:39.870
So when I turned 16, I was
eligible to go to this group

01:26:39.870 --> 01:26:41.550
home with other girls.

01:26:41.550 --> 01:26:44.460
And I started
experimenting with drugs.

01:26:44.460 --> 01:26:45.540
I was smoking weed.

01:26:45.540 --> 01:26:47.400
I mean I just wanted
some kind of escape,

01:26:47.400 --> 01:26:51.180
some kind of release, because
I didn't feel any connection

01:26:51.180 --> 01:26:54.804
to anyone, not even to myself.

01:26:54.804 --> 01:26:56.970
And then family court, going
back and forth to court

01:26:56.970 --> 01:26:59.330
during that time,
the legal aid who

01:26:59.330 --> 01:27:01.860
was supposed to be
representing me didn't ask me,

01:27:01.860 --> 01:27:02.607
what do you want?

01:27:02.607 --> 01:27:04.440
What's going on, or
what's going on at home?

01:27:04.440 --> 01:27:06.060
Or where do you want to go?

01:27:06.060 --> 01:27:08.560
So I just kind of cycled
through the system.

01:27:08.560 --> 01:27:12.960
And when I aged out at
18, there was no plan.

01:27:12.960 --> 01:27:14.980
There was no nowhere
for me to go.

01:27:14.980 --> 01:27:18.150
It was just like, well, you've
aged out of this system.

01:27:18.150 --> 01:27:21.780
And now we're just going to
leave you to your own devices.

01:27:21.780 --> 01:27:24.270
And what ended up
happening was, because I

01:27:24.270 --> 01:27:27.000
had no relationship with my
family, that wasn't reconciled,

01:27:27.000 --> 01:27:30.690
all those years from
14 to 18, I ended up

01:27:30.690 --> 01:27:32.880
moving in with a
boyfriend of mine.

01:27:32.880 --> 01:27:35.940
And by the time I turned
19, actually seven years

01:27:35.940 --> 01:27:40.020
to the day, I was arrested
for my part in a robbery.

01:27:40.020 --> 01:27:44.280
And I was tried as an adult.
And I served time in jail.

01:27:44.280 --> 01:27:48.930
And it's just been all
those missed opportunities

01:27:48.930 --> 01:27:50.220
from when I was younger.

01:27:50.220 --> 01:27:52.050
And it just seemed
so simple now,

01:27:52.050 --> 01:27:54.570
when I look back on it,
that all somebody had

01:27:54.570 --> 01:27:56.940
to do was ask me what
is going on with you?

01:27:56.940 --> 01:27:57.960
Or how can we help you?

01:27:57.960 --> 01:27:59.520
Or how can we support you?

01:27:59.520 --> 01:28:02.490
And that simple question could
have changed the trajectory

01:28:02.490 --> 01:28:04.060
of my whole life.

01:28:04.060 --> 01:28:06.630
And it's just been such a
struggle now from being a girl

01:28:06.630 --> 01:28:09.630
and now being an adult woman
with this felony conviction.

01:28:09.630 --> 01:28:13.200
And it's been so
challenging to find a job.

01:28:13.200 --> 01:28:17.222
And I'm not representative
of the population of girls

01:28:17.222 --> 01:28:18.180
that are in the system.

01:28:18.180 --> 01:28:19.680
I mean it
disproportionately affects

01:28:19.680 --> 01:28:21.280
women and girls of color.

01:28:21.280 --> 01:28:23.850
And I feel like it's a
responsibility that I have

01:28:23.850 --> 01:28:26.070
and that I hope that those
listening and those here

01:28:26.070 --> 01:28:29.190
today can understand that
we have a responsibility

01:28:29.190 --> 01:28:31.800
to speak out about it, because
it's the only way that we're

01:28:31.800 --> 01:28:33.930
going to change the hearts
and minds of people that

01:28:33.930 --> 01:28:35.610
can make decisions.

01:28:35.610 --> 01:28:38.160
And yeah, so it's
just been challenging.

01:28:38.160 --> 01:28:42.080
If we can change things from the
front door, which is the girls'

01:28:42.080 --> 01:28:43.330
system, then that would help.

01:28:43.330 --> 01:28:48.040
[APPLAUSE]

01:28:48.040 --> 01:28:50.750
MALIKA SAADA SAAR: I want to
talk about this piece more,

01:28:50.750 --> 01:28:53.740
that each of you has
given voice to of--

01:28:53.740 --> 01:28:57.430
nobody asked me
what was going on.

01:28:57.430 --> 01:29:04.180
I've spent many, many
moments and hours and days

01:29:04.180 --> 01:29:06.580
in girls' correctional
facilities.

01:29:06.580 --> 01:29:11.050
And I remember the first time
I went, I thought, my gosh,

01:29:11.050 --> 01:29:12.910
they're just girls.

01:29:12.910 --> 01:29:18.740
They're just hurt,
abused, violated girls.

01:29:18.740 --> 01:29:19.610
Right?

01:29:19.610 --> 01:29:20.750
[APPLAUSE]

01:29:20.750 --> 01:29:24.730
MALIKA SAADA SAAR: And I
want to understand better.

01:29:24.730 --> 01:29:27.610
Can you help me to
understand better?

01:29:27.610 --> 01:29:33.610
Why is it that the system feels
so comfortable just putting

01:29:33.610 --> 01:29:38.740
the girls behind bars, than
asking that question of what's

01:29:38.740 --> 01:29:41.880
going on?

01:29:41.880 --> 01:29:44.960
CHARITY CHANDLER-COLE: Well, I
think for girls, just overall,

01:29:44.960 --> 01:29:48.020
we're just looked at differently
in the criminal justice system.

01:29:48.020 --> 01:29:51.470
People fail to realize
that when we offend,

01:29:51.470 --> 01:29:53.870
it's normally because of
something we experienced

01:29:53.870 --> 01:29:55.610
in our life prior
to the offense,

01:29:55.610 --> 01:29:59.870
either through bad parenting
or poverty or lack of education

01:29:59.870 --> 01:30:00.860
or being abused.

01:30:00.860 --> 01:30:03.870
And that when we offend,
it's usually out of survival.

01:30:03.870 --> 01:30:07.009
So it's usually something
we've stolen or we've acted out

01:30:07.009 --> 01:30:09.050
or because we were actually
victims of something,

01:30:09.050 --> 01:30:12.140
such as sex trafficking
or exploitation or even

01:30:12.140 --> 01:30:13.490
domestic violence.

01:30:13.490 --> 01:30:18.020
And when they look at us as
women, because even as girls,

01:30:18.020 --> 01:30:19.820
we still are nurturers.

01:30:19.820 --> 01:30:22.760
We still help to provide for
our family and for our siblings,

01:30:22.760 --> 01:30:25.520
so when we offend
versus when boys offend,

01:30:25.520 --> 01:30:27.290
we should have
known better, and we

01:30:27.290 --> 01:30:30.100
deserve the punishment we
received, as opposed to boys--

01:30:30.100 --> 01:30:32.510
oh, they're just
youthful and immature.

01:30:32.510 --> 01:30:35.960
And when we are charged
for our offenses,

01:30:35.960 --> 01:30:39.470
ours are gender-specific
offenses versus--

01:30:39.470 --> 01:30:44.000
and so because they're
gender-specific offenses,

01:30:44.000 --> 01:30:46.504
were perceived differently
and judged differently

01:30:46.504 --> 01:30:48.920
and treated differently once
we're in the criminal justice

01:30:48.920 --> 01:30:49.419
system.

01:30:49.419 --> 01:30:52.700
Because what gets us in jail
versus what gets boys in jail,

01:30:52.700 --> 01:30:55.260
they don't really know
how to deal with that.

01:30:55.260 --> 01:31:00.770
So they just look at us as being
just bad, or we're acting out,

01:31:00.770 --> 01:31:03.085
or we're whores, because
we were sexually exploited

01:31:03.085 --> 01:31:03.960
or whatever the case.

01:31:03.960 --> 01:31:06.620
So we should be treated
as such, instead

01:31:06.620 --> 01:31:11.700
of realizing that we're more
vulnerable, we're more fragile,

01:31:11.700 --> 01:31:15.380
we need more help because
we're susceptible,

01:31:15.380 --> 01:31:17.770
more susceptible to
violence, and to be

01:31:17.770 --> 01:31:19.130
being treated differently.

01:31:19.130 --> 01:31:21.380
So it's just a
totally different lens

01:31:21.380 --> 01:31:23.980
because of what we're
because of our offenses.

01:31:23.980 --> 01:31:25.250
It's just different.

01:31:25.250 --> 01:31:28.840
And we often go to jail
for nonviolent offenses.

01:31:28.840 --> 01:31:30.761
And we get these crazy
ridiculous charges

01:31:30.761 --> 01:31:32.510
for something that's
minimal and something

01:31:32.510 --> 01:31:35.030
that, had someone taken
the time to say, you know,

01:31:35.030 --> 01:31:36.060
what's going on?

01:31:36.060 --> 01:31:39.281
Why are you 14, in
jail, for prostitution?

01:31:39.281 --> 01:31:41.780
You know the first thing I saw
when I went to juvenile hall,

01:31:41.780 --> 01:31:43.430
even though that
wasn't my charge,

01:31:43.430 --> 01:31:45.530
was that there were
so many girls in here

01:31:45.530 --> 01:31:47.840
locked up for having
sex with adult men.

01:31:47.840 --> 01:31:49.550
I was blown away.

01:31:49.550 --> 01:31:53.722
And at no point, did anyone
say what's happening?

01:31:53.722 --> 01:31:54.680
You're being exploited.

01:31:54.680 --> 01:31:55.790
You're being victimized.

01:31:55.790 --> 01:31:57.319
No, they were criminalized.

01:31:57.319 --> 01:31:59.360
And were constantly being
criminalized for things

01:31:59.360 --> 01:32:03.420
that we should be looked
at as ways to help us,

01:32:03.420 --> 01:32:06.206
and that's just not happening.

01:32:06.206 --> 01:32:07.580
MICHELLE DIAZ:
Well, I do believe

01:32:07.580 --> 01:32:09.170
that people don't
get to the root

01:32:09.170 --> 01:32:11.630
of the causes of the problems.

01:32:11.630 --> 01:32:14.580
We put, let's say,
we have to talk

01:32:14.580 --> 01:32:17.210
about who are the real
expertise on these.

01:32:17.210 --> 01:32:18.290
Like is it a book?

01:32:18.290 --> 01:32:19.910
Who's going to teach you?

01:32:19.910 --> 01:32:22.200
Like, what is it going
to be about in there?

01:32:22.200 --> 01:32:25.000
And now, of course, now
we need to put the youth,

01:32:25.000 --> 01:32:28.790
we need to put the people, and
nothing about us without us,

01:32:28.790 --> 01:32:29.560
you know?

01:32:29.560 --> 01:32:32.300
Who are the ones who are going
to come up with the solutions?

01:32:32.300 --> 01:32:35.420
Because we experienced
what is the problem.

01:32:35.420 --> 01:32:39.140
And of course, we have all these
amazing people that come here.

01:32:39.140 --> 01:32:42.810
It goes to the [INAUDIBLE]
centers or whatever.

01:32:42.810 --> 01:32:45.530
And they have no
idea they don't know

01:32:45.530 --> 01:32:48.090
what is it like to be there.

01:32:48.090 --> 01:32:51.950
And most importantly, the
people that come up with ideas

01:32:51.950 --> 01:32:57.770
or go to these places, and
when you end up in a facility,

01:32:57.770 --> 01:33:01.040
we have seen people be
treated differently.

01:33:01.040 --> 01:33:05.120
People, kids, who have been
intimidated by the staff.

01:33:05.120 --> 01:33:07.010
And you know, like when
you are in a facility

01:33:07.010 --> 01:33:09.380
once a month, once
whatever, you--

01:33:09.380 --> 01:33:12.770
the staff are there
for safety reasons.

01:33:12.770 --> 01:33:15.890
But are you able
to speak freely?

01:33:15.890 --> 01:33:16.800
Of course not.

01:33:16.800 --> 01:33:17.299
Why?

01:33:17.299 --> 01:33:19.400
Because you get
there, and you leave.

01:33:19.400 --> 01:33:20.330
No, I'm stayed there.

01:33:20.330 --> 01:33:23.480
And if I say something wrong,
what is going to happen next?

01:33:25.871 --> 01:33:27.620
SARAH ZARBA: I just
wanted to make a point

01:33:27.620 --> 01:33:29.450
that-- a status offense.

01:33:29.450 --> 01:33:32.900
So when I was actually
detained, like,

01:33:32.900 --> 01:33:34.970
a status offense is
something-- it's not a crime.

01:33:34.970 --> 01:33:38.630
And it's because of
your status as a minor

01:33:38.630 --> 01:33:40.550
that the action
becomes criminalized.

01:33:40.550 --> 01:33:42.320
And that's what
happened, that's how

01:33:42.320 --> 01:33:45.080
I started when I became
involved with the system,

01:33:45.080 --> 01:33:47.330
running away from home
and skipping school.

01:33:47.330 --> 01:33:48.890
I was placed in
handcuffs, and I was

01:33:48.890 --> 01:33:51.650
placed in a detention
facility in a jail cell

01:33:51.650 --> 01:33:53.150
because I skipped school.

01:33:53.150 --> 01:33:57.260
And I think people don't realize
that that's what we do here.

01:33:57.260 --> 01:33:59.090
I mean we really
take a hard look

01:33:59.090 --> 01:34:00.530
at the practices
and the policies

01:34:00.530 --> 01:34:04.250
that we have that affect girls
and just all kids in general.

01:34:04.250 --> 01:34:07.160
We should not be locking up
kids for skipping school.

01:34:07.160 --> 01:34:11.954
And that experience,
and not asking children,

01:34:11.954 --> 01:34:13.370
because that's
what we're talking,

01:34:13.370 --> 01:34:16.250
we're talking about
children, what

01:34:16.250 --> 01:34:17.930
the reasons behind
their actions are.

01:34:17.930 --> 01:34:20.750
And you know, I
remember just being

01:34:20.750 --> 01:34:23.030
the only girl in the facility.

01:34:23.030 --> 01:34:26.900
And I spent a lot of
times, I mean, isolated.

01:34:26.900 --> 01:34:30.370
Because we need to be separated
from the boys, and just

01:34:30.370 --> 01:34:32.810
there's always this
notion to protect girls.

01:34:32.810 --> 01:34:34.330
And we need all this protection.

01:34:34.330 --> 01:34:36.800
And that was not helpful,
because the protection that's

01:34:36.800 --> 01:34:38.480
offered is punitive.

01:34:38.480 --> 01:34:43.370
And it really damaged the
rest of my trajectory.

01:34:43.370 --> 01:34:45.820
So I think it's
important to listen.

01:34:45.820 --> 01:34:48.950
And there's a lot of
assumptions that are made,

01:34:48.950 --> 01:34:50.680
I think at different
system points.

01:34:50.680 --> 01:34:53.290
When you're in court, the
assumption is made by the judge

01:34:53.290 --> 01:34:55.960
that the legal aid has talked
about this with the kid

01:34:55.960 --> 01:34:56.830
or with the child.

01:34:56.830 --> 01:34:59.410
And that's not what
happened to me.

01:34:59.410 --> 01:35:02.530
So yeah, I think we just
need to start implementing

01:35:02.530 --> 01:35:04.992
that every system point.

01:35:04.992 --> 01:35:06.700
MICHELLE DIAZ: Can I
add something to it?

01:35:06.700 --> 01:35:12.107
So I do believe that we are
being put in the menu and not

01:35:12.107 --> 01:35:15.000
at the table.

01:35:15.000 --> 01:35:15.727
Yeah.

01:35:15.727 --> 01:35:18.310
MALIKA SAADA SAAR: Being put on
the menu and not at the table.

01:35:18.310 --> 01:35:19.143
MICHELLE DIAZ: Yeah.

01:35:22.730 --> 01:35:26.890
Unfortunately, what could be
a whole day of conversation

01:35:26.890 --> 01:35:30.310
on girls, and we need to have
a whole day on conversations

01:35:30.310 --> 01:35:33.940
around girls because of
the systematic negligence

01:35:33.940 --> 01:35:36.640
that is being
shown to our girls.

01:35:36.640 --> 01:35:40.900
We have to give the stage over
to Kat Blaque and Maui Chacon.

01:35:40.900 --> 01:35:42.970
But I wanted to so
deeply thank you

01:35:42.970 --> 01:35:47.770
for being the young women,
the young fierce warrior

01:35:47.770 --> 01:35:50.530
advocates for other girls
who are behind bars.

01:35:50.530 --> 01:35:51.490
Thank you so much.

01:35:51.490 --> 01:35:54.130
[APPLAUSE]

01:35:54.130 --> 01:35:55.000
KAT BLAQUE: Hello.

01:35:55.000 --> 01:35:57.340
I just wanted to thank you
guys so much for inviting me

01:35:57.340 --> 01:35:59.380
to introduce our next speaker.

01:35:59.380 --> 01:36:01.270
My name is Kat, and
I've been a YouTuber

01:36:01.270 --> 01:36:04.130
since I was a young teenager.

01:36:04.130 --> 01:36:06.407
YouTube has been a very
central place in my life,

01:36:06.407 --> 01:36:07.990
and it's really been
where I've always

01:36:07.990 --> 01:36:10.210
come to express the
things that have

01:36:10.210 --> 01:36:14.100
happened in my life, the
good, the bad, and the ugly.

01:36:14.100 --> 01:36:16.510
And unfortunately,
while I had my platform,

01:36:16.510 --> 01:36:19.150
I experienced sexual violence.

01:36:19.150 --> 01:36:23.840
And because YouTube had
been such an integral part

01:36:23.840 --> 01:36:24.840
of my life.

01:36:24.840 --> 01:36:27.590
It was where I turned
to express my trauma.

01:36:27.590 --> 01:36:30.650
And that didn't go very well.

01:36:30.650 --> 01:36:34.790
I was told, almost immediately,
that I had made up the story.

01:36:34.790 --> 01:36:37.130
That I had told the
story for views.

01:36:37.130 --> 01:36:40.190
That I had fabricated
it, because after all,

01:36:40.190 --> 01:36:43.190
who would want to
rape someone like me?

01:36:43.190 --> 01:36:45.590
And so I internalized that.

01:36:45.590 --> 01:36:46.850
I deleted my videos.

01:36:46.850 --> 01:36:49.520
And for a really long time,
I didn't talk about it.

01:36:49.520 --> 01:36:52.610
But once I gained the strength
to speak about it again,

01:36:52.610 --> 01:36:57.950
I realized just how much
rape and sexual violence

01:36:57.950 --> 01:36:59.750
is a tool of silence.

01:36:59.750 --> 01:37:04.220
Just how much it is used against
women and people, in general,

01:37:04.220 --> 01:37:08.180
to silence them and to stop them
from being able to get justice.

01:37:08.180 --> 01:37:11.660
That rape culture
relies on this silence.

01:37:11.660 --> 01:37:13.790
And that social
media, especially,

01:37:13.790 --> 01:37:17.120
is an amazing place for us to be
able to come forward and speak.

01:37:17.120 --> 01:37:18.620
And when I started
telling my story,

01:37:18.620 --> 01:37:21.980
I got contacted by women who
had similar stories, who said

01:37:21.980 --> 01:37:24.560
that my story reflected theirs.

01:37:24.560 --> 01:37:26.210
And we all said to
each other the words

01:37:26.210 --> 01:37:32.910
that we all needed to hear so
badly, that we believed you.

01:37:32.910 --> 01:37:38.790
So social media has been a very
important part of my activism

01:37:38.790 --> 01:37:40.320
and what I do.

01:37:40.320 --> 01:37:43.350
We've seen so many good and
positive things come out

01:37:43.350 --> 01:37:44.580
of raising voices.

01:37:44.580 --> 01:37:48.030
And a lot of the women
today, those that spoke,

01:37:48.030 --> 01:37:52.170
are leaving me wanting to have
conversations on my platform

01:37:52.170 --> 01:37:54.300
to draw attention to
a lot of the things

01:37:54.300 --> 01:37:57.060
that I didn't know about
were happening to our women

01:37:57.060 --> 01:37:58.620
and girls.

01:37:58.620 --> 01:38:01.710
Our next speaker is going
to be Maui Chacon, who

01:38:01.710 --> 01:38:05.340
is a woman who has
been using her poetry

01:38:05.340 --> 01:38:11.260
to fight against women who are
being who are being trafficked.

01:38:11.260 --> 01:38:14.010
So I just wanted to
introduce Maui Chacon.

01:38:14.010 --> 01:38:24.104
[APPLAUSE]

01:38:24.104 --> 01:38:25.020
MAUI CHACON: Hi, guys.

01:38:27.580 --> 01:38:29.390
OK.

01:38:29.390 --> 01:38:32.750
So yeah, I was trafficked at 12.

01:38:32.750 --> 01:38:35.660
Thank you.

01:38:35.660 --> 01:38:38.270
So I wrote this poem
when I was 13 years old.

01:38:38.270 --> 01:38:40.460
I just wanted to give
you guys a mind frame

01:38:40.460 --> 01:38:44.510
of where I was at the time.

01:38:44.510 --> 01:38:47.880
Am I walking through hell or
beneath the shadows of death?

01:38:47.880 --> 01:38:49.340
I need someone to help me.

01:38:49.340 --> 01:38:51.360
I'm like a baby
crying for a nipple,

01:38:51.360 --> 01:38:53.100
like a dog wanting it's owner.

01:38:53.100 --> 01:38:55.040
Beautiful on the outside,
but feel degraded,

01:38:55.040 --> 01:38:57.450
misused, and ugly on the inside.

01:38:57.450 --> 01:38:59.940
Why no one love me for me?

01:38:59.940 --> 01:39:03.270
Pushing people away because they
act as if they care, like Tupac

01:39:03.270 --> 01:39:05.220
with his mistress love affair?

01:39:05.220 --> 01:39:08.880
Have a soul of steel, a heart
as flimsy as a bird's feather,

01:39:08.880 --> 01:39:12.750
like a tiger hunted for prey,
but a mind frame of a baby cub,

01:39:12.750 --> 01:39:16.800
on the level of a great boat and
have a spark out of this world.

01:39:16.800 --> 01:39:19.440
And I have dreams,
but what is that?

01:39:19.440 --> 01:39:21.730
I want to help people
because I need help.

01:39:21.730 --> 01:39:25.620
I reach out to people because
no one reached out to me.

01:39:25.620 --> 01:39:28.170
I'm living alone with
no honesty and existing

01:39:28.170 --> 01:39:30.420
in this world with no dignity.

01:39:30.420 --> 01:39:31.890
They say I have a purpose.

01:39:31.890 --> 01:39:33.270
But what might that be?

01:39:33.270 --> 01:39:35.460
I want to be like Sleeping
Beauty, hopefully wake up

01:39:35.460 --> 01:39:37.590
in someone else's
body that's not me.

01:39:37.590 --> 01:39:39.336
I keep asking who might that be?

01:39:39.336 --> 01:39:40.710
I want to be like
Pink, how she's

01:39:40.710 --> 01:39:42.660
so energetic and so sweet.

01:39:42.660 --> 01:39:44.910
Like [INAUDIBLE]
crying like a puppy,

01:39:44.910 --> 01:39:48.005
acting out like Angelina
Jolie, Mr. and Mrs. Smith,

01:39:48.005 --> 01:39:48.810
beating myself up.

01:39:48.810 --> 01:39:51.860
Not me, but the inside of me.

01:39:51.860 --> 01:39:54.830
They say I act out
because of my ADHD.

01:39:54.830 --> 01:39:56.380
I'm going to be me.

01:39:56.380 --> 01:39:58.020
Learn to sit up like a baby.

01:39:58.020 --> 01:40:00.290
Better yet, trying
to come out a cocoon,

01:40:00.290 --> 01:40:02.300
hopefully one day, or maybe.

01:40:02.300 --> 01:40:04.640
Picking that cheese,
like a baby mice,

01:40:04.640 --> 01:40:07.310
like a caged bird
screaming for food.

01:40:07.310 --> 01:40:11.270
Is it bad that my mind seeks
the gates of hell, or wonders

01:40:11.270 --> 01:40:12.820
for a black night?

01:40:12.820 --> 01:40:15.620
Why can't I have
someone hold me tight?

01:40:15.620 --> 01:40:17.690
I look at my reflection,
and yet my body

01:40:17.690 --> 01:40:21.080
starts to feel cold, like
a polar bear in winter

01:40:21.080 --> 01:40:23.340
but a vampire at night.

01:40:23.340 --> 01:40:26.130
Katrina washing people
away and I'm trying

01:40:26.130 --> 01:40:27.610
to find that secret get away.

01:40:27.610 --> 01:40:28.110
Thank you.

01:40:28.110 --> 01:40:40.210
[APPLAUSE]

01:40:40.210 --> 01:40:41.340
SPEAKER 2: Wow.

01:40:41.340 --> 01:40:43.390
Thank you, Maui, for
sharing your words.

01:40:43.390 --> 01:40:44.800
The poem speaks for itself.

01:40:44.800 --> 01:40:48.880
But I just feel so incredibly
privileged to be in this room.

01:40:48.880 --> 01:40:53.200
And thank all of you for
sharing your stories.

01:40:53.200 --> 01:40:57.130
Just-- we're so privileged to
have you here at Google today.

01:40:57.130 --> 01:41:00.730
For those of you that I haven't
met, my name is [INAUDIBLE].

01:41:00.730 --> 01:41:03.610
And I'm a program
manager at Google.org,

01:41:03.610 --> 01:41:06.520
which is the philanthropic
arm of Google.

01:41:06.520 --> 01:41:08.810
And I support our
racial justice work.

01:41:08.810 --> 01:41:12.370
So I've been incredibly
moved by everything

01:41:12.370 --> 01:41:15.220
I've heard today
and also reminded

01:41:15.220 --> 01:41:17.680
of sort of where we've
started this work as Google

01:41:17.680 --> 01:41:19.450
and how far it's come.

01:41:19.450 --> 01:41:22.330
So I wanted to share a
little bit of that story

01:41:22.330 --> 01:41:25.630
and reflect back to when
we began our racial justice

01:41:25.630 --> 01:41:28.810
funding at Google back in 2014.

01:41:28.810 --> 01:41:31.390
And we were, to be
honest, curiously

01:41:31.390 --> 01:41:34.360
optimistic about
where it would lead.

01:41:34.360 --> 01:41:37.450
Like many folks in the
room, there are definitely

01:41:37.450 --> 01:41:40.150
Googlers who have been
impacted by the system

01:41:40.150 --> 01:41:43.960
of mass incarceration, who have
parents and family members who

01:41:43.960 --> 01:41:48.450
are incarcerated today, and
many of these Googlers advocate

01:41:48.450 --> 01:41:51.430
and volunteer with criminal
justice organizations

01:41:51.430 --> 01:41:53.140
in their personal time.

01:41:53.140 --> 01:41:56.470
But working on the
giving team at Google,

01:41:56.470 --> 01:41:59.170
we were trying to
move this issue

01:41:59.170 --> 01:42:01.990
to the center of our
company's consciousness

01:42:01.990 --> 01:42:05.110
and to bring it to
a place where we

01:42:05.110 --> 01:42:08.020
could open that conversation
to those who may not

01:42:08.020 --> 01:42:10.440
feel as proximate to the issue.

01:42:10.440 --> 01:42:13.720
And so I remember the day that
my colleague, Justin Steele,

01:42:13.720 --> 01:42:15.700
got the signal
from our executives

01:42:15.700 --> 01:42:18.500
to present our initial work
in this area at our company

01:42:18.500 --> 01:42:19.000
meeting.

01:42:19.000 --> 01:42:23.740
And Malika referenced it at
the beginning of our day.

01:42:23.740 --> 01:42:28.930
But it's a big meeting.

01:42:28.930 --> 01:42:30.850
Googlers from all
over the world tune

01:42:30.850 --> 01:42:35.440
in on GBC, which is our kind
of virtual way to connect.

01:42:35.440 --> 01:42:37.990
And the room isn't that much
bigger than this one here,

01:42:37.990 --> 01:42:40.570
but we knew that thousands of
Googlers would be listening.

01:42:40.570 --> 01:42:45.310
And it was our way to kind
test out Googlers' willingness

01:42:45.310 --> 01:42:47.620
to get close to the issue.

01:42:47.620 --> 01:42:50.560
And I remember, on the back end,
calling our community partners

01:42:50.560 --> 01:42:53.320
and letting them know, many of
them who we're now supporting

01:42:53.320 --> 01:42:55.030
through our grants,
that this work

01:42:55.030 --> 01:42:57.490
was going to be talked about
during our company meeting.

01:42:57.490 --> 01:42:59.830
And I actually didn't share
how big that meeting was,

01:42:59.830 --> 01:43:01.900
so they might think it
was just a couple of folks

01:43:01.900 --> 01:43:05.140
who were interested in
hearing more about their work.

01:43:05.140 --> 01:43:08.530
But the response from
Googlers that day,

01:43:08.530 --> 01:43:11.590
and to this day, Googlers who
are challenging themselves

01:43:11.590 --> 01:43:15.790
to learn more about this issue
and supporting the folks that

01:43:15.790 --> 01:43:18.640
have boots on the
ground, it really

01:43:18.640 --> 01:43:23.110
inspires us on our team to
keep moving the company forward

01:43:23.110 --> 01:43:29.200
and challenging ourselves
to discuss this conversation

01:43:29.200 --> 01:43:31.450
and push where we
haven't pushed before.

01:43:31.450 --> 01:43:34.030
So our employees have
hosted movie screenings

01:43:34.030 --> 01:43:36.490
on mass incarceration,
both on campus

01:43:36.490 --> 01:43:39.370
and in the community; policy
convenings, like today,

01:43:39.370 --> 01:43:42.070
on criminal justice; brought
some of the nation's most

01:43:42.070 --> 01:43:44.570
prominent speakers and
voices in the movement,

01:43:44.570 --> 01:43:48.700
folks like Brian Stevenson and
Gina Clayton to our campus;

01:43:48.700 --> 01:43:52.480
and are volunteering in the
communities and in prisons.

01:43:52.480 --> 01:43:55.120
And we think that's
very important.

01:43:55.120 --> 01:43:59.380
We're very excited now to
be testing out Googlers

01:43:59.380 --> 01:44:03.100
actually getting on the
ground, in the office,

01:44:03.100 --> 01:44:05.290
and working alongside one
of our community partners,

01:44:05.290 --> 01:44:09.250
Center for Policing Equity
to engineer systems and help

01:44:09.250 --> 01:44:12.700
build a national database
that can help reduce bias

01:44:12.700 --> 01:44:13.960
in policing.

01:44:13.960 --> 01:44:16.270
And so I just wanted
to share with the room

01:44:16.270 --> 01:44:20.590
that we're pushing ourselves
to get smarter and do more.

01:44:20.590 --> 01:44:22.350
And I want to
encourage everyone who

01:44:22.350 --> 01:44:26.860
is listening from the
company side on the GBC today

01:44:26.860 --> 01:44:32.880
to really just continue your
volunteering, your giving,

01:44:32.880 --> 01:44:36.100
and learn more about this issue.

01:44:36.100 --> 01:44:39.150
And as we are challenged today,
make an intentional effort

01:44:39.150 --> 01:44:42.960
to support and share our
platform with women and girls

01:44:42.960 --> 01:44:45.570
who are directly impacted.

01:44:45.570 --> 01:44:48.195
You can go to go/getproximate,
if you're listening in,

01:44:48.195 --> 01:44:50.070
to get involved with
our volunteering efforts

01:44:50.070 --> 01:44:52.710
at Google.org in
criminal justice.

01:44:52.710 --> 01:44:55.170
And then for the folks
who are in the room,

01:44:55.170 --> 01:44:57.900
let's please find
ways to collaborate.

01:44:57.900 --> 01:45:02.130
If you have a creative idea on
how we can share our platforms,

01:45:02.130 --> 01:45:03.900
please find me after this event.

01:45:03.900 --> 01:45:05.400
Or you can reach out to me.

01:45:05.400 --> 01:45:09.567
My email address
is maab@google.org.

01:45:09.567 --> 01:45:12.150
And you can learn more about our
criminal justice grant-making

01:45:12.150 --> 01:45:15.150
efforts at www.Google.org.

01:45:15.150 --> 01:45:17.925
So thank you all for sharing
this room with us today,

01:45:17.925 --> 01:45:19.800
and for sharing your
voices and your stories.

01:45:19.800 --> 01:45:21.246
We really appreciate it.

01:45:21.246 --> 01:45:25.869
[APPLAUSE]

01:45:25.869 --> 01:45:27.660
MALIKA SAADA SAAR: I
really thank everybody

01:45:27.660 --> 01:45:29.790
for being with us today.

01:45:29.790 --> 01:45:31.710
And I want to give
special thanks

01:45:31.710 --> 01:45:35.900
and honor to the women and
girls who not only shared

01:45:35.900 --> 01:45:38.910
their narratives, but also
their expertise of how

01:45:38.910 --> 01:45:42.900
we dismantle these
pipelines into incarceration

01:45:42.900 --> 01:45:45.160
for women and girls.

01:45:45.160 --> 01:45:48.180
I also want to say
to those in the room

01:45:48.180 --> 01:45:53.400
and those who are listening in,
that one powerful way of being

01:45:53.400 --> 01:45:56.010
part of this movement to
make sure that our women

01:45:56.010 --> 01:45:58.920
and girls are not
left behind, is

01:45:58.920 --> 01:46:01.590
to know what the National
Council for Formerly

01:46:01.590 --> 01:46:05.370
Incarcerated and Incarcerated
Women and Girls is up to.

01:46:05.370 --> 01:46:08.100
If you go to their
website, you can find out

01:46:08.100 --> 01:46:12.480
how to donate to them as well
as be part of the campaigns

01:46:12.480 --> 01:46:14.520
that they are advancing.

01:46:14.520 --> 01:46:18.840
I also want to plead to make
sure that we, as a company,

01:46:18.840 --> 01:46:21.300
continue to be
proximate, continue

01:46:21.300 --> 01:46:25.890
to recognize that this issue
is at the center of all

01:46:25.890 --> 01:46:28.620
of our work and
communities and lives.

01:46:28.620 --> 01:46:30.460
That it is not marginal.

01:46:30.460 --> 01:46:34.560
That it is part of how
we can use our goodness,

01:46:34.560 --> 01:46:39.120
and use our wisdom, and use
our platforms to make sure

01:46:39.120 --> 01:46:43.080
that we live in a society
where everyone is valued,

01:46:43.080 --> 01:46:47.040
where every life, where every
mother-child bond is honored

01:46:47.040 --> 01:46:50.020
and has the chance to be.

01:46:50.020 --> 01:46:52.980
And finally, I want
to close this out

01:46:52.980 --> 01:46:55.560
on two notes of gratitude.

01:46:55.560 --> 01:47:00.397
Gratitude to Topeka Sam for
helping us bring the women in.

01:47:00.397 --> 01:47:03.151
[APPLAUSE]

01:47:03.151 --> 01:47:05.470
MALIKA SAADA SAAR: We have
to keep thinking about ways

01:47:05.470 --> 01:47:08.200
to use tech to scale
the prison walls.

01:47:08.200 --> 01:47:10.480
And we tried to do that today.

01:47:10.480 --> 01:47:13.300
And thank you, Topeka,
for helping us to do that,

01:47:13.300 --> 01:47:17.830
to bring the voices of
Miss Alice and Miss Santra

01:47:17.830 --> 01:47:19.570
into our space.

01:47:19.570 --> 01:47:21.760
And I also want to
give special thanks

01:47:21.760 --> 01:47:25.438
to Greer Stockman who allowed
this all to come together.

01:47:25.438 --> 01:47:30.127
[APPLAUSE]

01:47:30.127 --> 01:47:32.460
MALIKA SAADA SAAR: Thank you
for all of the courage that

01:47:32.460 --> 01:47:33.900
was shown today.

01:47:33.900 --> 01:47:37.980
And we are going to close out
with Christen Lien, allowing

01:47:37.980 --> 01:47:40.170
us to just breathe
in this moment,

01:47:40.170 --> 01:47:42.840
and think how we are
going to move forward

01:47:42.840 --> 01:47:44.260
in the work before us.

01:47:44.260 --> 01:47:44.760
Thank you.

01:47:44.760 --> 01:47:48.210
[APPLAUSE]

01:47:48.210 --> 01:47:50.910
CHRISTEN LIEN: Hi, everyone.

01:47:50.910 --> 01:47:52.980
There's two songs I want
to play for you today

01:47:52.980 --> 01:47:56.340
that I think are very fitting.

01:47:56.340 --> 01:47:59.190
And before I do, while I set
up and tune my instrument

01:47:59.190 --> 01:48:01.811
over here, anyone that's away
in the distance, feels far away,

01:48:01.811 --> 01:48:03.310
and wants to come
over to this side,

01:48:03.310 --> 01:48:05.560
we'll have a second
for you to do that.

01:48:05.560 --> 01:48:08.430
The first song I want to
play is called "The Escape."

01:48:08.430 --> 01:48:11.220
And it's from an album that's
coming out later this year.

01:48:11.220 --> 01:48:12.720
And this song, this
single actually,

01:48:12.720 --> 01:48:15.130
is going to drop on Thursday.

01:48:15.130 --> 01:48:18.150
So you guys are hearing
it before everyone else.

01:48:18.150 --> 01:48:21.060
And it's called "The
Escape" because my new album

01:48:21.060 --> 01:48:24.240
is about a character
who escapes a prison.

01:48:24.240 --> 01:48:27.810
And I wrote this song
not just about escaping

01:48:27.810 --> 01:48:31.500
a physical prison, but the kind
that we impose on ourselves

01:48:31.500 --> 01:48:33.900
in terms of the kind of
self-love we give ourselves,

01:48:33.900 --> 01:48:36.570
or how we allow other
people to dictate who we are

01:48:36.570 --> 01:48:37.680
and what we can be.

01:48:37.680 --> 01:48:40.050
So I hope you enjoy it.

01:48:40.050 --> 01:48:41.890
And then I'll explain
the second song here.

01:48:41.890 --> 01:48:43.570
So thank you very much.

01:48:43.570 --> 01:48:44.070

 ESCAPE"]

01:56:44.180 --> 01:56:46.920
CHRISTEN LIEN: Thank you.

01:56:46.920 --> 01:56:50.050
Thank you so much for everyone
sharing stories today.

01:56:50.050 --> 01:56:51.860
It has just been
an incredible day.

01:56:51.860 --> 01:56:55.920
And leads me to why I want
to play this next song that I

01:56:55.920 --> 01:56:58.260
wrote, called "Unconditional."

01:56:58.260 --> 01:56:59.940
And I call it
"Unconditional" because I

01:56:59.940 --> 01:57:02.430
wanted to write a song
that captured the essence

01:57:02.430 --> 01:57:04.290
of unconditional love.

01:57:04.290 --> 01:57:06.650
Not just any kind of
love, but unconditional--

01:57:06.650 --> 01:57:10.230
it's the kind that loves you
not only in your best moments,

01:57:10.230 --> 01:57:13.470
but your worst
moments, you know?

01:57:13.470 --> 01:57:14.970
The kind of love
that accepts you

01:57:14.970 --> 01:57:19.020
for who you are, including the
highest version of yourself,

01:57:19.020 --> 01:57:21.540
and then that monster
that comes out sometimes

01:57:21.540 --> 01:57:24.680
that we're ashamed of,
but is a part of us.

01:57:24.680 --> 01:57:28.110
The stories of our lives
that we can't be without,

01:57:28.110 --> 01:57:32.040
because as hard as
they are, they made us.

01:57:32.040 --> 01:57:33.780
They are us.

01:57:33.780 --> 01:57:36.840
So I wanted to see if
I could write a song,

01:57:36.840 --> 01:57:39.720
even without lyrics, that could
capture that feeling of what

01:57:39.720 --> 01:57:42.270
it means to be unconditionally
loved for those of us who

01:57:42.270 --> 01:57:43.410
know that feeling.

01:57:43.410 --> 01:57:46.350
Because even though everyone
deserves unconditional love,

01:57:46.350 --> 01:57:47.476
not everyone has it.

01:57:47.476 --> 01:57:49.350
So I thought if I could
capture it in a song,

01:57:49.350 --> 01:57:51.000
we could all share it.

01:57:51.000 --> 01:57:51.980
Thank you.
