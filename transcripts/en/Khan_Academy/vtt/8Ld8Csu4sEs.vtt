00:00:00.630 --> 00:00:02.810
We now know that if
we have two triangles

00:00:02.810 --> 00:00:05.110
and all of their
corresponding sides

00:00:05.110 --> 00:00:07.910
are the same, so by
side, side, side-- so

00:00:07.910 --> 00:00:09.670
if the corresponding
sides, all three

00:00:09.670 --> 00:00:12.150
of the corresponding sides,
have the same length,

00:00:12.150 --> 00:00:15.034
we know that those
triangles are congruent.

00:00:15.034 --> 00:00:16.450
What I want to do
in this video is

00:00:16.450 --> 00:00:18.540
explore if there
are other properties

00:00:18.540 --> 00:00:20.750
that we can find between
the triangles that

00:00:20.750 --> 00:00:23.870
can help us feel pretty good
that those two triangles would

00:00:23.870 --> 00:00:25.110
be congruent.

00:00:25.110 --> 00:00:26.690
So side, side, side works.

00:00:26.690 --> 00:00:28.770
What about angle, angle, angle?

00:00:28.770 --> 00:00:30.210
So let me do that over here.

00:00:30.210 --> 00:00:31.860
What about angle angle angle?

00:00:31.860 --> 00:00:33.840
So what I'm saying
is, is if-- let's say

00:00:33.840 --> 00:00:36.060
I have a triangle
like this, like I

00:00:36.060 --> 00:00:39.640
have a triangle like that, and
I have a triangle like this.

00:00:39.640 --> 00:00:44.550
And if we know that this angle
is congruent to that angle,

00:00:44.550 --> 00:00:47.660
if this angle is congruent
to that angle, which

00:00:47.660 --> 00:00:51.610
means that their measures are
equal, or-- and-- I should say

00:00:51.610 --> 00:00:55.100
and-- and that angle is
congruent to that angle,

00:00:55.100 --> 00:00:59.350
can we say that these are
two congruent triangles?

00:00:59.350 --> 00:01:01.870
And at first case, it
looks like maybe it

00:01:01.870 --> 00:01:03.470
is, at least the
way I drew it here.

00:01:03.470 --> 00:01:04.970
But when you think
about it, you can

00:01:04.970 --> 00:01:08.616
have the exact same
corresponding angles,

00:01:08.616 --> 00:01:10.830
having the same measure
or being congruent,

00:01:10.830 --> 00:01:13.760
but you could actually scale one
of these triangles up and down

00:01:13.760 --> 00:01:15.390
and still have that property.

00:01:15.390 --> 00:01:20.840
For example, if I had this
triangle right over here,

00:01:20.840 --> 00:01:23.630
it looks similar--
and I'm using that

00:01:23.630 --> 00:01:25.550
in just the everyday
language sense--

00:01:25.550 --> 00:01:28.740
it has the same shape as these
triangles right over here.

00:01:28.740 --> 00:01:31.650
And it has the same angles.

00:01:31.650 --> 00:01:34.070
That angle is congruent
to that angle,

00:01:34.070 --> 00:01:36.700
this angle down here is
congruent to this angle

00:01:36.700 --> 00:01:39.570
over here, and this
angle over here

00:01:39.570 --> 00:01:41.510
is congruent to this
angle over here.

00:01:41.510 --> 00:01:44.020
So all of the angles in all
three of these triangles

00:01:44.020 --> 00:01:44.800
are the same.

00:01:44.800 --> 00:01:47.080
The corresponding angles
have the same measure.

00:01:47.080 --> 00:01:50.690
But clearly, clearly this
triangle right over here

00:01:50.690 --> 00:01:52.010
is not the same.

00:01:52.010 --> 00:01:54.120
It is not congruent
to the other two.

00:01:54.120 --> 00:01:56.940
The sides have a very
different length.

00:01:56.940 --> 00:01:59.850
This side is much shorter than
this side right over here.

00:01:59.850 --> 00:02:02.500
This side is much shorter
than that side over there.

00:02:02.500 --> 00:02:04.650
And this side is much
shorter over here.

00:02:04.650 --> 00:02:06.580
So with just angle,
angle, angle,

00:02:06.580 --> 00:02:11.090
you cannot say that a triangle
has the same size and shape.

00:02:11.090 --> 00:02:14.070
It does have the same shape
but not the same size.

00:02:14.070 --> 00:02:18.530
So this does not
imply congruency.

00:02:18.530 --> 00:02:21.400
So angle, angle, angle
does not imply congruency.

00:02:21.400 --> 00:02:24.130
What it does imply, and we
haven't talked about this yet,

00:02:24.130 --> 00:02:26.500
is that these are
similar triangles.

00:02:26.500 --> 00:02:29.012
So angle, angle,
angle implies similar.

00:02:29.012 --> 00:02:30.220
So let me write it over here.

00:02:30.220 --> 00:02:32.250
It implies similar triangles.

00:02:32.250 --> 00:02:33.975
And similar-- you
probably are use

00:02:33.975 --> 00:02:36.100
to the word in just everyday
language-- but similar

00:02:36.100 --> 00:02:39.190
has a very specific
meaning in geometry.

00:02:39.190 --> 00:02:42.500
And similar things have
the same shape but not

00:02:42.500 --> 00:02:44.800
necessarily the same size.

00:02:44.800 --> 00:02:47.050
So anything that is
congruent, because it

00:02:47.050 --> 00:02:50.120
has the same size and
shape, is also similar.

00:02:50.120 --> 00:02:53.030
But not everything that is
similar is also congruent.

00:02:53.030 --> 00:02:56.910
So for example, this
triangle is similar-- all

00:02:56.910 --> 00:02:59.080
of these triangles are
similar to each other,

00:02:59.080 --> 00:03:00.520
but they aren't all congruent.

00:03:00.520 --> 00:03:02.215
These two are congruent
if their sides

00:03:02.215 --> 00:03:04.090
are the same-- I didn't
make that assumption.

00:03:04.090 --> 00:03:06.096
But if we know that
their sides are the same,

00:03:06.096 --> 00:03:07.720
then we can say that
they're congruent.

00:03:07.720 --> 00:03:10.050
But neither of these are
congruent to this one right

00:03:10.050 --> 00:03:12.030
over here, because this
is clearly much larger.

00:03:12.030 --> 00:03:14.530
It has the same shape
but a different size.

00:03:14.530 --> 00:03:18.590
So we can't have an AAA
postulate or an AAA axiom

00:03:18.590 --> 00:03:20.820
to get to congruency.

00:03:20.820 --> 00:03:23.220
What about side, angle, side?

00:03:23.220 --> 00:03:26.880
So let's try this out,
side, angle, side.

00:03:26.880 --> 00:03:29.727
So let's start off with one
triangle right over here.

00:03:29.727 --> 00:03:32.060
So let's start off with a
triangle that looks like this.

00:03:32.060 --> 00:03:35.010
I have my blue side,
I have my pink side,

00:03:35.010 --> 00:03:37.410
and I have my magenta side.

00:03:37.410 --> 00:03:40.410
And let's say that I have
another triangle that

00:03:40.410 --> 00:03:42.520
has this blue side.

00:03:42.520 --> 00:03:45.670
It has the same side, same
length as that blue side.

00:03:45.670 --> 00:03:47.530
So let me draw it like that.

00:03:47.530 --> 00:03:49.820
It has the same length
as that blue side.

00:03:49.820 --> 00:03:53.180
So that length and that length
are going to be the same.

00:03:53.180 --> 00:03:56.170
It has a congruent
angle right after that.

00:03:56.170 --> 00:04:00.020
So this angle and the next
angle for this triangle

00:04:00.020 --> 00:04:02.496
are going to have
the same measure,

00:04:02.496 --> 00:04:03.870
or they're going
to be congruent.

00:04:03.870 --> 00:04:07.207
And then the next
side is going to have

00:04:07.207 --> 00:04:08.790
the same length as
this one over here.

00:04:08.790 --> 00:04:12.360
So that's going to be the
same length as this over here.

00:04:12.360 --> 00:04:15.140
So it's going to
be the same length.

00:04:15.140 --> 00:04:20.490
And because we only know that
two of the corresponding sides

00:04:20.490 --> 00:04:23.119
have the same length, and
the angle between them--

00:04:23.119 --> 00:04:25.160
and this is important--
the angle between the two

00:04:25.160 --> 00:04:28.630
corresponding sides also
have the same measure,

00:04:28.630 --> 00:04:32.230
we can do anything we want with
this last side on this one.

00:04:32.230 --> 00:04:33.855
We can essentially--
it's going to have

00:04:33.855 --> 00:04:35.540
to start right over here.

00:04:35.540 --> 00:04:36.980
You could start from this point.

00:04:36.980 --> 00:04:39.940
And we can pivot it to
form any triangle we want.

00:04:39.940 --> 00:04:42.065
But we can see, the only
way we can form a triangle

00:04:42.065 --> 00:04:44.170
is if we bring this side
all the way over here

00:04:44.170 --> 00:04:46.560
and close this right over there.

00:04:46.560 --> 00:04:51.780
And so we can see just
logically for two triangles,

00:04:51.780 --> 00:04:54.540
they have one side that
has the length the same,

00:04:54.540 --> 00:04:56.260
the next side has
a length the same,

00:04:56.260 --> 00:04:59.710
and the angle in between
them-- so this angle--

00:04:59.710 --> 00:05:02.080
let me do that in the
same color-- this angle in

00:05:02.080 --> 00:05:03.570
between them, this is the angle.

00:05:03.570 --> 00:05:06.310
This A is this angle
and that angle.

00:05:06.310 --> 00:05:08.080
It's the angle in between them.

00:05:08.080 --> 00:05:10.590
This first side is in blue.

00:05:10.590 --> 00:05:13.716
And this second side right,
over here, is in pink.

00:05:13.716 --> 00:05:15.490
Well, it's already
written in pink.

00:05:15.490 --> 00:05:17.770
So we can see that if two
sides are the same, have

00:05:17.770 --> 00:05:19.760
the same length-- two
corresponding sides have

00:05:19.760 --> 00:05:21.593
the same length, and
the corresponding angle

00:05:21.593 --> 00:05:23.950
between them, they
have to be congruent.

00:05:23.950 --> 00:05:27.000
There's no other one place
to put this third side.

00:05:27.000 --> 00:05:29.270
So SAS-- and sometimes,
it's once again

00:05:29.270 --> 00:05:32.230
called a postulate, an axiom,
or if it's kind of proven,

00:05:32.230 --> 00:05:34.500
sometimes is called
a theorem-- this

00:05:34.500 --> 00:05:38.594
does imply that the two
triangles are congruent.

00:05:38.594 --> 00:05:40.760
So we will give ourselves
this tool in our tool kit.

00:05:40.760 --> 00:05:42.960
We had the SSS postulate.

00:05:42.960 --> 00:05:45.320
Now we have the SAS postulate.

00:05:45.320 --> 00:05:47.830
Two sides are equal and
the angle in between them,

00:05:47.830 --> 00:05:50.730
for two triangles,
corresponding sides and angles,

00:05:50.730 --> 00:05:53.120
then we can say that
it is definitely--

00:05:53.120 --> 00:05:55.362
these are congruent triangles.

00:05:55.362 --> 00:05:56.820
Now what about--
and I'm just going

00:05:56.820 --> 00:06:00.900
to try to go through all the
different combinations here--

00:06:00.900 --> 00:06:04.170
what if I have
angle, side, angle?

00:06:04.170 --> 00:06:05.730
So let me try that.

00:06:05.730 --> 00:06:09.420
So what happens if I
have angle, side, angle?

00:06:09.420 --> 00:06:12.232
So let's go back to this
one right over here.

00:06:12.232 --> 00:06:13.940
So actually, let me
just redraw a new one

00:06:13.940 --> 00:06:15.640
for each of these cases.

00:06:15.640 --> 00:06:20.230
So angle, side, angle, so
I'll draw a triangle here.

00:06:20.230 --> 00:06:22.160
So I have this triangle.

00:06:22.160 --> 00:06:24.500
So this would be maybe the side.

00:06:24.500 --> 00:06:25.816
That would be the side.

00:06:25.816 --> 00:06:27.940
So let me draw the whole
triangle, actually, first.

00:06:27.940 --> 00:06:29.460
So I have this triangle.

00:06:29.460 --> 00:06:31.600
Let me draw one side over here.

00:06:31.600 --> 00:06:34.090
And then let me draw
one side over there.

00:06:34.090 --> 00:06:36.650
And this angle right
over here, I'll

00:06:36.650 --> 00:06:39.230
call it-- I'll do it in orange.

00:06:39.230 --> 00:06:43.790
And this angle over here,
I will do it in yellow.

00:06:43.790 --> 00:06:45.560
So if I have another
triangle that

00:06:45.560 --> 00:06:49.449
has one side having
equal measure--

00:06:49.449 --> 00:06:51.490
so I'll use it as this
blue side right over here.

00:06:51.490 --> 00:06:53.940
So it has one side
that has equal measure.

00:06:53.940 --> 00:06:56.730
And the two angles on
either side of that side,

00:06:56.730 --> 00:06:59.610
or at either end of
that side, are the same,

00:06:59.610 --> 00:07:01.505
will this triangle
necessarily be congruent?

00:07:01.505 --> 00:07:03.380
And we're just going to
try to reason it out.

00:07:03.380 --> 00:07:04.570
These aren't formal proofs.

00:07:04.570 --> 00:07:05.986
We're really just
trying to set up

00:07:05.986 --> 00:07:07.680
what are reasonable
postulates, or what

00:07:07.680 --> 00:07:11.400
are reasonable assumptions
we can have in our tool kit

00:07:11.400 --> 00:07:13.370
as we try to prove other things.

00:07:13.370 --> 00:07:17.625
So that angle, let's call it
that angle, right over there,

00:07:17.625 --> 00:07:20.130
they're going to have the
same measure in this triangle.

00:07:20.130 --> 00:07:22.497
And this angle right
over here in yellow

00:07:22.497 --> 00:07:24.580
is going to have the same
measure on this triangle

00:07:24.580 --> 00:07:26.030
right over here.

00:07:26.030 --> 00:07:28.570
So regardless,
I'm not in any way

00:07:28.570 --> 00:07:30.130
constraining the
sides over here.

00:07:30.130 --> 00:07:33.700
So this side right over
here could have any length.

00:07:33.700 --> 00:07:37.340
It could have any length, but it
has to form this angle with it.

00:07:37.340 --> 00:07:38.506
So it could have any length.

00:07:38.506 --> 00:07:40.830
And it can just go as
far as it wants to go.

00:07:40.830 --> 00:07:43.490
In no way have we constrained
what the length of that is.

00:07:43.490 --> 00:07:45.290
And actually, let me
mark this off, too.

00:07:45.290 --> 00:07:47.230
So this is the same as this.

00:07:47.230 --> 00:07:48.570
So that side can be anything.

00:07:48.570 --> 00:07:50.040
We haven't constrained it all.

00:07:50.040 --> 00:07:53.160
And once again, this
side could be anything.

00:07:53.160 --> 00:07:54.690
We haven't
constrained it at all.

00:07:54.690 --> 00:07:56.630
But we know it has
to go at this angle.

00:07:56.630 --> 00:07:58.410
So it has to go at that angle.

00:07:58.410 --> 00:08:00.424
Well, once again,
there's only one triangle

00:08:00.424 --> 00:08:01.590
that can be formed this way.

00:08:01.590 --> 00:08:03.298
We can say all day
that this length could

00:08:03.298 --> 00:08:05.230
be as long as we want
or as short as we want.

00:08:05.230 --> 00:08:06.900
And this one could be as
long as we want and as short

00:08:06.900 --> 00:08:07.750
as we want.

00:08:07.750 --> 00:08:10.083
But the only way that they
can actually touch each other

00:08:10.083 --> 00:08:12.760
and form a triangle and
have these two angles,

00:08:12.760 --> 00:08:18.390
is if they are the exact same
length as these two sides

00:08:18.390 --> 00:08:19.140
right over here.

00:08:19.140 --> 00:08:22.761
So this side will actually have
to be the same as that side.

00:08:22.761 --> 00:08:24.760
And this would have to
be the same as that side.

00:08:24.760 --> 00:08:26.790
Once again, this isn't a proof.

00:08:26.790 --> 00:08:30.080
I'd call it more of a reasoning
through it or an investigation,

00:08:30.080 --> 00:08:32.919
really just to establish
what reasonable baselines,

00:08:32.919 --> 00:08:36.120
or axioms, or assumptions, or
postulates that we could have.

00:08:36.120 --> 00:08:40.070
So for my purposes, I
think ASA does show us

00:08:40.070 --> 00:08:44.727
that two triangles
are congruent.

00:08:44.727 --> 00:08:45.810
Now let's try another one.

00:08:45.810 --> 00:08:49.010
Let's try angle, angle, side.

00:08:49.010 --> 00:08:50.510
Let's try angle, angle, side.

00:08:50.510 --> 00:08:52.571
And in some geometry
classes, maybe

00:08:52.571 --> 00:08:54.320
if you have to go
through an exam quickly,

00:08:54.320 --> 00:08:57.086
you might memorize, OK, side,
side, side implies congruency.

00:08:57.086 --> 00:08:58.210
And that's kind of logical.

00:08:58.210 --> 00:08:59.751
Side, angle, side
implies congruency,

00:08:59.751 --> 00:09:01.660
and so on, and so forth.

00:09:01.660 --> 00:09:03.140
I'm not a fan of memorizing it.

00:09:03.140 --> 00:09:04.880
It might be good
for time pressure.

00:09:04.880 --> 00:09:07.470
It is good to, sometimes, even
just go through this logic.

00:09:07.470 --> 00:09:09.420
If you're like, wait, does
angle, angle, angle work?

00:09:09.420 --> 00:09:10.878
Well, no, I can
find this case that

00:09:10.878 --> 00:09:12.440
breaks down angle, angle, angle.

00:09:12.440 --> 00:09:14.540
If these work, just try
to verify for yourself

00:09:14.540 --> 00:09:17.880
that they make logical sense
why they would imply congruency.

00:09:17.880 --> 00:09:20.910
Now, let's try
angle, angle, side.

00:09:20.910 --> 00:09:24.620
Let's try angle, angle, side.

00:09:24.620 --> 00:09:27.670
So once again, let's have
a triangle over here.

00:09:27.670 --> 00:09:28.936
It has some side.

00:09:28.936 --> 00:09:31.310
So this one is going to be a
little bit more interesting.

00:09:31.310 --> 00:09:32.270
So it has some side.

00:09:32.270 --> 00:09:34.184
That's the side
right over there.

00:09:34.184 --> 00:09:35.350
And then, it has two angles.

00:09:35.350 --> 00:09:38.750
So let me draw the other
sides of this triangle.

00:09:38.750 --> 00:09:42.000
I'll draw one in magenta
and then one in green.

00:09:42.000 --> 00:09:45.720
And there's two angles
and then the side.

00:09:45.720 --> 00:09:48.200
So let's say you
have this angle-- you

00:09:48.200 --> 00:09:49.650
have that angle
right over there.

00:09:49.650 --> 00:09:50.720
Actually, I didn't
have to put a double,

00:09:50.720 --> 00:09:53.053
because that's the first angle
that I'm-- So I have that

00:09:53.053 --> 00:09:55.580
angle, which we'll refer
to as that first A.

00:09:55.580 --> 00:10:01.110
Then we have this angle,
which is that second A.

00:10:01.110 --> 00:10:05.570
So if I know that there's
another triangle that

00:10:05.570 --> 00:10:08.860
has one side having the
same length-- so let me draw

00:10:08.860 --> 00:10:11.680
it like that-- it has one
side having the same length.

00:10:11.680 --> 00:10:16.140
It has one angle on that side
that has the same measure.

00:10:16.140 --> 00:10:18.520
So it has a measure like that.

00:10:18.520 --> 00:10:23.950
And so this side right over
here could be of any length.

00:10:23.950 --> 00:10:26.590
We aren't constraining what
the length of that side is.

00:10:26.590 --> 00:10:28.980
But whatever the angle is on
the other side of that side

00:10:28.980 --> 00:10:32.350
is going to be the same as this
green angle right over here.

00:10:32.350 --> 00:10:34.327
So for example, it
could be like that.

00:10:34.327 --> 00:10:36.410
And then you could have a
green side go like that.

00:10:36.410 --> 00:10:39.650
It could be like that and have
the green side go like that.

00:10:39.650 --> 00:10:41.560
And if we have--
so the only thing

00:10:41.560 --> 00:10:46.490
we're assuming is that this
is the same length as this,

00:10:46.490 --> 00:10:49.360
and that this angle is the
same measure as that angle,

00:10:49.360 --> 00:10:51.710
and that this measure is the
same measure as that angle.

00:10:51.710 --> 00:10:54.390
And this magenta line
can be of any length,

00:10:54.390 --> 00:10:56.330
and this green line
can be of any length.

00:10:56.330 --> 00:10:58.440
We in no way have
constrained that.

00:10:58.440 --> 00:11:01.590
But can we form any triangle
that is not congruent to this?

00:11:01.590 --> 00:11:04.000
Because the bottom line
is, this green line

00:11:04.000 --> 00:11:06.330
is going to touch this
one right over there.

00:11:06.330 --> 00:11:10.040
And the only way it's going to
touch that one right over there

00:11:10.040 --> 00:11:13.370
is if it starts right
over here, because we're

00:11:13.370 --> 00:11:15.210
constraining this
angle right over here.

00:11:15.210 --> 00:11:16.970
We're constraining that angle.

00:11:16.970 --> 00:11:18.630
And so it looks
like angle, angle,

00:11:18.630 --> 00:11:23.220
side does indeed
imply congruency.

00:11:23.220 --> 00:11:26.110
So that does imply congruency.

00:11:26.110 --> 00:11:28.860
So let's just do one more
just to kind of try out

00:11:28.860 --> 00:11:30.806
all of the different situations.

00:11:30.806 --> 00:11:32.180
What if we have--
and I'm running

00:11:32.180 --> 00:11:33.240
out of a little
bit of real estate

00:11:33.240 --> 00:11:34.970
right over here at
the bottom-- what

00:11:34.970 --> 00:11:39.030
if we tried out
side, side, angle?

00:11:39.030 --> 00:11:42.000
So once again, draw a triangle.

00:11:42.000 --> 00:11:44.310
So it has one side there.

00:11:44.310 --> 00:11:46.710
It has another side there.

00:11:46.710 --> 00:11:49.750
And then-- I don't have to
do those hash marks just yet.

00:11:49.750 --> 00:11:54.497
So one side, then another
side, and then another side.

00:11:54.497 --> 00:11:57.080
And what happens if we know that
there's another triangle that

00:11:57.080 --> 00:12:00.470
has two of the sides the same
and then the angle after it?

00:12:00.470 --> 00:12:04.480
So for example, we would have
that side just like that,

00:12:04.480 --> 00:12:05.940
and then it has another side.

00:12:05.940 --> 00:12:09.540
But we're not
constraining the angle.

00:12:09.540 --> 00:12:11.910
We aren't constraining
this angle right over here,

00:12:11.910 --> 00:12:14.021
but we're constraining
the length of that side.

00:12:14.021 --> 00:12:15.020
So let me color code it.

00:12:15.020 --> 00:12:17.500
So that blue side
is that first side.

00:12:17.500 --> 00:12:21.150
Then we have this magenta
side right over there.

00:12:21.150 --> 00:12:23.835
So this is going to be the same
length as this right over here.

00:12:23.835 --> 00:12:25.460
But let me make it
at a different angle

00:12:25.460 --> 00:12:27.350
to see if I can disprove it.

00:12:27.350 --> 00:12:29.270
So let's say it looks like that.

00:12:29.270 --> 00:12:31.840
Or actually let me make
it even more interesting.

00:12:36.340 --> 00:12:39.600
Let me try to make it like that.

00:12:39.600 --> 00:12:41.090
So it's a very different angle.

00:12:41.090 --> 00:12:43.600
But now, it has to have
the same angle out here.

00:12:43.600 --> 00:12:45.700
It has to have that
same angle out here.

00:12:45.700 --> 00:12:47.640
So it has to be
roughly that angle.

00:12:47.640 --> 00:12:50.680
So it actually looks like we
can draw a triangle that is not

00:12:50.680 --> 00:12:54.429
congruent that has two
sides being the same length

00:12:54.429 --> 00:12:55.720
and then an angle is different.

00:12:55.720 --> 00:12:57.660
For example, this
is pretty much that.

00:12:57.660 --> 00:13:00.550
I made this angle
smaller than this angle.

00:13:00.550 --> 00:13:02.250
These two sides are the same.

00:13:02.250 --> 00:13:05.495
This angle is the same now, but
what the byproduct of that is,

00:13:05.495 --> 00:13:08.310
is that this green side is going
to be shorter on this triangle

00:13:08.310 --> 00:13:09.470
right over here.

00:13:09.470 --> 00:13:12.740
So you don't necessarily
have congruent triangles

00:13:12.740 --> 00:13:16.220
with side, side, angle.

00:13:16.220 --> 00:13:19.350
So this is not
necessarily congruent,

00:13:19.350 --> 00:13:23.520
not necessarily, or similar.

00:13:23.520 --> 00:13:27.650
It gives us neither
congruency nor similarity.
