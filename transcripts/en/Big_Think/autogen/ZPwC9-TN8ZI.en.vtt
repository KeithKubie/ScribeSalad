china is a specific problem and

00:00:06.639 --> 00:00:06.649
china is a specific problem and
 

00:00:06.649 --> 00:00:09.580
china is a specific problem and
opportunity for every company pretty

00:00:09.580 --> 00:00:09.590
opportunity for every company pretty
 

00:00:09.590 --> 00:00:11.169
opportunity for every company pretty
much every company because they are a

00:00:11.169 --> 00:00:11.179
much every company because they are a
 

00:00:11.179 --> 00:00:13.480
much every company because they are a
dominating force both in their domestic

00:00:13.480 --> 00:00:13.490
dominating force both in their domestic
 

00:00:13.490 --> 00:00:15.520
dominating force both in their domestic
market as well as their offshore market

00:00:15.520 --> 00:00:15.530
market as well as their offshore market
 

00:00:15.530 --> 00:00:17.650
market as well as their offshore market
and I think a you have to take China

00:00:17.650 --> 00:00:17.660
and I think a you have to take China
 

00:00:17.660 --> 00:00:20.260
and I think a you have to take China
seriously and China is a very nuanced

00:00:20.260 --> 00:00:20.270
seriously and China is a very nuanced
 

00:00:20.270 --> 00:00:22.180
seriously and China is a very nuanced
environment that many of us don't

00:00:22.180 --> 00:00:22.190
environment that many of us don't
 

00:00:22.190 --> 00:00:24.460
environment that many of us don't
understand completely yet and I think

00:00:24.460 --> 00:00:24.470
understand completely yet and I think
 

00:00:24.470 --> 00:00:27.010
understand completely yet and I think
the way you do well in new environments

00:00:27.010 --> 00:00:27.020
the way you do well in new environments
 

00:00:27.020 --> 00:00:29.530
the way you do well in new environments
is to experiment right you just don't go

00:00:29.530 --> 00:00:29.540
is to experiment right you just don't go
 

00:00:29.540 --> 00:00:31.240
is to experiment right you just don't go
in thinking you know at all what you do

00:00:31.240 --> 00:00:31.250
in thinking you know at all what you do
 

00:00:31.250 --> 00:00:33.340
in thinking you know at all what you do
is you go in and experiment and some of

00:00:33.340 --> 00:00:33.350
is you go in and experiment and some of
 

00:00:33.350 --> 00:00:35.319
is you go in and experiment and some of
the most successful experiments so far

00:00:35.319 --> 00:00:35.329
the most successful experiments so far
 

00:00:35.329 --> 00:00:36.700
the most successful experiments so far
and China have been going in and

00:00:36.700 --> 00:00:36.710
and China have been going in and
 

00:00:36.710 --> 00:00:38.799
and China have been going in and
creating joint venture relationships

00:00:38.799 --> 00:00:38.809
creating joint venture relationships
 

00:00:38.809 --> 00:00:40.630
creating joint venture relationships
with Chinese partners where there's a

00:00:40.630 --> 00:00:40.640
with Chinese partners where there's a
 

00:00:40.640 --> 00:00:44.229
with Chinese partners where there's a
50-50 relationship or 51-49 and you

00:00:44.229 --> 00:00:44.239
50-50 relationship or 51-49 and you
 

00:00:44.239 --> 00:00:46.479
50-50 relationship or 51-49 and you
learn how to operate in this nuanced

00:00:46.479 --> 00:00:46.489
learn how to operate in this nuanced
 

00:00:46.489 --> 00:00:49.059
learn how to operate in this nuanced
environment and be successful the

00:00:49.059 --> 00:00:49.069
environment and be successful the
 

00:00:49.069 --> 00:00:51.970
environment and be successful the
opportunity in China is massive but I

00:00:51.970 --> 00:00:51.980
opportunity in China is massive but I
 

00:00:51.980 --> 00:00:53.739
opportunity in China is massive but I
think again companies have to be

00:00:53.739 --> 00:00:53.749
think again companies have to be
 

00:00:53.749 --> 00:00:56.049
think again companies have to be
cautious around you know where there's

00:00:56.049 --> 00:00:56.059
cautious around you know where there's
 

00:00:56.059 --> 00:00:57.969
cautious around you know where there's
great opportunity there's also great

00:00:57.969 --> 00:00:57.979
great opportunity there's also great
 

00:00:57.979 --> 00:01:00.579
great opportunity there's also great
risk and I think you have to not go in

00:01:00.579 --> 00:01:00.589
risk and I think you have to not go in
 

00:01:00.589 --> 00:01:03.700
risk and I think you have to not go in
blindly but you have to go in in stages

00:01:03.700 --> 00:01:03.710
blindly but you have to go in in stages
 

00:01:03.710 --> 00:01:05.229
blindly but you have to go in in stages
and I think you have to experiment

00:01:05.229 --> 00:01:05.239
and I think you have to experiment
 

00:01:05.239 --> 00:01:07.510
and I think you have to experiment
through each level of those stages in

00:01:07.510 --> 00:01:07.520
through each level of those stages in
 

00:01:07.520 --> 00:01:09.490
through each level of those stages in
order to successfully make it to the

00:01:09.490 --> 00:01:09.500
order to successfully make it to the
 

00:01:09.500 --> 00:01:12.399
order to successfully make it to the
next stage and you see companies for

00:01:12.399 --> 00:01:12.409
next stage and you see companies for
 

00:01:12.409 --> 00:01:14.679
next stage and you see companies for
example in the computer business you

00:01:14.679 --> 00:01:14.689
example in the computer business you
 

00:01:14.689 --> 00:01:17.289
example in the computer business you
know one of our domestic large computer

00:01:17.289 --> 00:01:17.299
know one of our domestic large computer
 

00:01:17.299 --> 00:01:20.230
know one of our domestic large computer
manufacturers has gone in they they they

do engineering in China they build in

00:01:22.990 --> 00:01:23.000
do engineering in China they build in
 

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:24.760
do engineering in China they build in
China and they sell in China and they've

00:01:24.760 --> 00:01:24.770

China that's really hard is that you
 

00:02:03.829 --> 00:02:08.710
China that's really hard is that you
know is that you know they can decide

00:02:08.710 --> 00:02:08.720
know is that you know they can decide
 

00:02:08.720 --> 00:02:11.470
know is that you know they can decide
that you're uninvited right and then

00:02:11.470 --> 00:02:11.480
that you're uninvited right and then
 

00:02:11.480 --> 00:02:13.479
that you're uninvited right and then
they become your worst you know then

00:02:13.479 --> 00:02:13.489
they become your worst you know then
 

00:02:13.489 --> 00:02:15.309
they become your worst you know then
they can become one of your greatest

00:02:15.309 --> 00:02:15.319
they can become one of your greatest
 

00:02:15.319 --> 00:02:16.200
they can become one of your greatest

so I think that's why the experimental

00:02:18.420 --> 00:02:18.430
so I think that's why the experimental
 

00:02:18.430 --> 00:02:19.980
so I think that's why the experimental
piece is really important so going to

00:02:19.980 --> 00:02:19.990
piece is really important so going to
 

00:02:19.990 --> 00:02:22.560
piece is really important so going to
step by step by step and using joint

00:02:22.560 --> 00:02:22.570
step by step by step and using joint
 

00:02:22.570 --> 00:02:24.630
step by step by step and using joint
ventures is a powerful way to sort of

00:02:24.630 --> 00:02:24.640
ventures is a powerful way to sort of
 

00:02:24.640 --> 00:02:26.430
ventures is a powerful way to sort of
gain entry and gain knowledge on how to

00:02:26.430 --> 00:02:26.440
gain entry and gain knowledge on how to
 

00:02:26.440 --> 00:02:28.800
