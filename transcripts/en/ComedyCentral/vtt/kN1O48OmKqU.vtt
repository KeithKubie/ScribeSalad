00:00:03.863 --> 00:00:04.696
- [Dan] Yeah.

00:00:04.696 --> 00:00:05.529
- Anytime I'm at a coffee
place, they're like

00:00:05.529 --> 00:00:07.412
"what's your name?" I just go nope.

00:00:07.412 --> 00:00:08.245
- [Dan] Yeah.
(laughing)

00:00:08.245 --> 00:00:09.837
- We're not doing this shit.

00:00:09.837 --> 00:00:10.670
(rock music)

00:00:10.670 --> 00:00:13.728
(fire crackling)

00:00:13.728 --> 00:00:15.533
- Do you get worried
that your son's 19 and

00:00:15.533 --> 00:00:17.737
just out there now? As you know like...

00:00:17.737 --> 00:00:18.710
- No, not really.

00:00:18.710 --> 00:00:20.560
I'd like to think that I

00:00:20.560 --> 00:00:24.520
Well, I don't know if
I instill great values.

00:00:24.520 --> 00:00:25.353
- [Dan] Yeah.

00:00:25.353 --> 00:00:26.463
- You know, good enough.

00:00:26.463 --> 00:00:28.212
- Okay so you putting him out there like

00:00:28.212 --> 00:00:30.393
Jay's daughter is gonna be 16 in October.

00:00:30.393 --> 00:00:31.773
- Okay I have a daughter that's 14.

00:00:31.773 --> 00:00:33.074
- Nutty. Huh? You have
a daughter that's 14?

00:00:33.074 --> 00:00:34.743
- My daughter's gonna be
a freshmen this year yeah.

00:00:34.743 --> 00:00:35.660
- Is that terrifying?

00:00:35.660 --> 00:00:37.205
Was that, I mean cause.

00:00:37.205 --> 00:00:38.301
- In every step of it.

00:00:38.301 --> 00:00:39.695
- It's terrifying a little because

00:00:39.695 --> 00:00:41.935
I talk about, and she said
it was okay to do, but I

00:00:41.935 --> 00:00:44.581
talk about her first period
she had at my house in my act.

00:00:44.581 --> 00:00:45.681
- [Dan] Yeah.

00:00:45.681 --> 00:00:47.250
Oh man you don't think about that.

00:00:47.250 --> 00:00:48.607
If you're the daughter of a comedian

00:00:48.607 --> 00:00:50.378
and you're like, uh man, with Isabella.

00:00:50.378 --> 00:00:51.682
- [Chad] Yeah. I asked.

00:00:51.682 --> 00:00:53.233
- And your daughter.

00:00:53.233 --> 00:00:54.975
- I said here's what I like to say

00:00:54.975 --> 00:00:56.652
and I told her everything
that I was going to say.

00:00:56.652 --> 00:00:58.620
But grown men will come
up to me after shows,

00:00:58.620 --> 00:00:59.995
and she goes "Oh, she's a woman now."

00:00:59.995 --> 00:01:01.797
And I'm like, I will fucking murder you.

00:01:01.797 --> 00:01:02.657
(laughs)

00:01:02.657 --> 00:01:04.697
No she's not, she's a
little girl, so back it up.

00:01:04.697 --> 00:01:08.290
â™ª Girl, you'll be a woman soon. â™ª

00:01:08.290 --> 00:01:10.327
- Cause I noticed you talked
about your little girl

00:01:10.327 --> 00:01:11.731
becoming a woman. And you're like,

00:01:11.731 --> 00:01:13.521
"I'll rip you God damn throat out."

00:01:13.521 --> 00:01:15.931
Who's at a comedy club
like, "I enjoyed that act,

00:01:15.931 --> 00:01:18.042
let me go talk to him about
his daughter's period."

00:01:18.042 --> 00:01:19.890
- Several people, you'd be surprised.

00:01:19.890 --> 00:01:23.149
- And how old is this little princess, 14?

00:01:23.149 --> 00:01:24.638
Countdown starts.

00:01:24.638 --> 00:01:25.471
- [Dan] There he goes.

00:01:25.471 --> 00:01:26.712
- Nice to meet you Mr. Daniels.

00:01:26.712 --> 00:01:29.127
- Anyways, good show.

00:01:29.127 --> 00:01:31.030
Is this the new lady of the lake?

00:01:31.030 --> 00:01:32.382
(laughs)

00:01:32.382 --> 00:01:34.438
He goes, "good jokes."

00:01:34.438 --> 00:01:36.210
- A mature woman in Tijuana.

00:01:36.210 --> 00:01:37.043
(laughs)

00:01:37.043 --> 00:01:41.045
- He goes, "You know in certain
kingdoms, you'd be a queen."

00:01:41.045 --> 00:01:42.408
Anyways, good jokes. I'll see ya later.

00:01:42.408 --> 00:01:44.342
(laughs)

00:01:44.342 --> 00:01:46.000
- My palms are sweating right now

00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:47.899
just thinking about this shit.

00:01:47.899 --> 00:01:51.467
- Ah dude, yeah! If someone
without kids, like Jay and I...

00:01:51.467 --> 00:01:52.800
- Soft features.

00:01:53.862 --> 00:01:55.276
Anyway man, love the closures.

00:01:55.276 --> 00:01:57.009
(laughs)

00:01:57.009 --> 00:01:58.612
- Been a fan for quite some time.

00:01:58.612 --> 00:02:00.342
(laughs)

00:02:00.342 --> 00:02:01.360
- I follow all of your work.

00:02:01.360 --> 00:02:05.231
- He goes, "Ay ay ay, good stock. Anyways.

00:02:05.231 --> 00:02:06.064
Yeah, I really enjoyed...

00:02:06.064 --> 00:02:07.304
- I remember listening to stories

00:02:07.304 --> 00:02:09.015
about her when she was three.

00:02:09.015 --> 00:02:10.391
(laughter)

00:02:10.391 --> 00:02:13.236
- You know, I thought she
aged nice in your act,

00:02:13.236 --> 00:02:14.805
turns out better in person.

00:02:14.805 --> 00:02:17.002
- Well look who's filling out.

00:02:17.002 --> 00:02:20.169
Anyway, can you make it out to Steven.

00:02:21.108 --> 00:02:23.205
- Seriously, I got every
one you put out there.

00:02:23.205 --> 00:02:24.229
- This is for my friend:

00:02:24.229 --> 00:02:26.534
To Steve, you're a fag for not coming.

00:02:26.534 --> 00:02:27.867
Check, you write that please.

00:02:27.867 --> 00:02:30.214
Guys, he's asks you to write
something like volatile.

00:02:30.214 --> 00:02:31.047
I don't know
- Yeah.

00:02:31.047 --> 00:02:31.880
- I'm gonna stab you in the throat,

00:02:31.880 --> 00:02:33.369
I don't want to put that down.

00:02:33.369 --> 00:02:34.643
(Chad laughs)

00:02:34.643 --> 00:02:35.754
- I pray for your death.

00:02:35.754 --> 00:02:38.083
I hope your mother never
recovers from her surgeries.

00:02:38.083 --> 00:02:39.810
- Yeah! Hey dude, I
understand that you're fan,

00:02:39.810 --> 00:02:41.516
you came out, I can't
write 'death to America,

00:02:41.516 --> 00:02:43.223
praise Allah', I just feel like that's...

00:02:43.223 --> 00:02:44.929
- My girlfriend couldn't
make the show man,

00:02:44.929 --> 00:02:46.813
but if you could write like,
"If you would've been here,

00:02:46.813 --> 00:02:48.380
I'd try to fuck you, that'd be great".

00:02:48.380 --> 00:02:49.213
- Yeah, uh..

00:02:49.213 --> 00:02:50.183
- Yeah, I'm gonna put my name on that.

00:02:50.183 --> 00:02:51.124
(laughter)

00:02:51.124 --> 00:02:54.641
- Or the Shanghai, you're
making a video with me right now

00:02:54.641 --> 00:02:56.318
for this asshole who couldn't come.

00:02:56.318 --> 00:03:00.431
- Aw dude, no his kid just
got hit by a car, hold on.

00:03:00.431 --> 00:03:01.807
Steve!

00:03:01.807 --> 00:03:03.460
Look what you're missing!

00:03:03.460 --> 00:03:05.267
Your son's bones are weak!

00:03:05.267 --> 00:03:07.349
Aw, awesome dudes, thanks, man.

00:03:07.349 --> 00:03:08.182
- My friend couldn't make it, man.

00:03:08.182 --> 00:03:09.508
He's being shipped home from Iraq.

00:03:09.508 --> 00:03:10.586
He's legless.

00:03:10.586 --> 00:03:11.586
Hey, Thomas!

00:03:12.759 --> 00:03:13.592
- [Dan] Wish you could run to the club!

00:03:13.592 --> 00:03:14.824
- Look who I'm with!

00:03:14.824 --> 00:03:16.969
- Dude, this would've put
you in such a better mood.

00:03:16.969 --> 00:03:18.504
- Yeah, aw man, no, yeah,

00:03:18.504 --> 00:03:20.368
my friend just found out his
wife just completely fucked

00:03:20.368 --> 00:03:23.148
him over like financially,
emotionally, and spiritually.

00:03:23.148 --> 00:03:23.981
Hold on real quick.

00:03:23.981 --> 00:03:24.898
Hey, Boner!

00:03:26.250 --> 00:03:28.347
- Yeah, what's up, Dick-nuts,
look who I'm sittin' with!

00:03:28.347 --> 00:03:30.572
- [Dan] I'm 'bout to do a shot
with your favorite comedian,

00:03:30.572 --> 00:03:31.405
Fuck-face!

00:03:32.420 --> 00:03:33.253
Yeah, he's crying.

00:03:33.253 --> 00:03:34.086
Like, we're on suicide watch.

00:03:34.086 --> 00:03:37.308
All of us have to call
him, to check in his house.

00:03:37.308 --> 00:03:39.740
So you called me last
night while I was watching

00:03:39.740 --> 00:03:42.036
Hard Knocks, which is great this season.

00:03:42.036 --> 00:03:43.593
Really enjoying it.

00:03:43.593 --> 00:03:46.229
But, (mumbles) about Jay just the same way

00:03:46.229 --> 00:03:47.812
they called me out for
looking like I'm dressing

00:03:47.812 --> 00:03:50.486
for a Rock N' Jock bit softball game.

00:03:50.486 --> 00:03:51.619
When you called me, I go, yeah dude

00:03:51.619 --> 00:03:52.933
I'm watching Hard Knocks.

00:03:52.933 --> 00:03:54.785
And you go, "what are you
watching? Some wide receiver

00:03:54.785 --> 00:03:56.508
"taking his baby mamma out to dinner?"

00:03:56.508 --> 00:03:58.000
I'm like, oh no.
(laughing)

00:03:58.000 --> 00:03:59.583
I go, "no I'm watching the
fourth ring quarterback

00:03:59.583 --> 00:04:02.378
take his stripper girlfriend
to some fuckin' bug place.

00:04:02.378 --> 00:04:04.780
And you go, exactly.
- [Jay] Exactly.

00:04:04.780 --> 00:04:06.824
But he called me because
you were like, dude,

00:04:06.824 --> 00:04:09.086
did you know that Ariana
Grande, or as I call her,

00:04:09.086 --> 00:04:10.612
airy-anna-gran-dee.

00:04:10.612 --> 00:04:11.973
- You'd been watching Total Divas,

00:04:11.973 --> 00:04:12.854
is what you were watching?

00:04:12.854 --> 00:04:13.687
- Yeah, hey shut up.

00:04:13.687 --> 00:04:14.520
- [Jay] I like to follow everyone.

00:04:14.520 --> 00:04:15.648
- I was watching SmackDown, dude.

00:04:15.648 --> 00:04:16.688
- I follow everybody.

00:04:16.688 --> 00:04:17.521
- Fight me.

00:04:17.521 --> 00:04:19.564
(laughs)

00:04:19.564 --> 00:04:21.017
But you called me and were like, dude,

00:04:21.017 --> 00:04:22.621
Ariana, which I knew that she had a song

00:04:22.621 --> 00:04:23.489
called Pete Davidson, but.

00:04:23.489 --> 00:04:24.683
- I was late to the game on this.

00:04:24.683 --> 00:04:27.430
- But I knew it was
coming, I just didn't...

00:04:27.430 --> 00:04:28.531
- Isabella told me.

00:04:28.531 --> 00:04:29.364
- She told you about it?

00:04:29.364 --> 00:04:30.197
- Yeah.

00:04:30.197 --> 00:04:31.030
- [Dan] It's called Pete Davidson

00:04:31.030 --> 00:04:32.845
and then you said at the end,

00:04:32.845 --> 00:04:37.183
she says it's only like a
minute forty-five seconds long.

00:04:37.183 --> 00:04:39.515
- I'm sorry, how long are the
songs gettin' written for you?

00:04:39.515 --> 00:04:41.546
- Which, I didn't know she
was gonna do a fuckin' Ramones

00:04:41.546 --> 00:04:43.641
fuckin' punk lines.

- God bless the queen.

00:05:27.193 --> 00:05:28.343
I didn't know she was British.

00:05:28.343 --> 00:05:29.413
- Holy shit, man.

00:05:29.413 --> 00:05:31.674
She did a whole thing, huh.

00:05:31.674 --> 00:05:34.518
She wore tight plaid pants
with a bunch of suspenders on.

00:05:34.518 --> 00:05:35.547
- Oh my God.

00:05:35.547 --> 00:05:37.558
Did you have a bunch
of fuckin' silver rings

00:05:37.558 --> 00:05:38.827
hanging out of her plaid pants.

00:05:38.827 --> 00:05:40.594

â™ª And I love Pete Davidson â™ª

00:05:53.558 --> 00:05:57.595
â™ª I drank his blood, I
drank his cum, I drank him â™ª

00:05:57.595 --> 00:05:59.583
â™ª Oi oi oi oi â™ª

00:05:59.583 --> 00:06:01.196
(laughing)

00:06:01.196 --> 00:06:04.066
â™ª And I, I, I, I â™ª

00:06:04.066 --> 00:06:06.818
â™ª love Pete Davidson â™ª

00:06:06.818 --> 00:06:09.398
- Young Iggy Pop'n it,
rolling around on glass.

00:06:09.398 --> 00:06:10.381
(laughing)

00:06:10.381 --> 00:06:11.591
- Yeah, just cutting herself.

00:06:11.591 --> 00:06:12.424
Man!

00:06:13.334 --> 00:06:15.298
She is going out for it.

00:06:15.298 --> 00:06:17.024
â™ª Let the blood go â™ª

00:06:17.024 --> 00:06:20.036
â™ª I love Pete Davidson â™ª

00:06:20.036 --> 00:06:22.756
- I just wanted to tap into
a different part of my art,

00:06:22.756 --> 00:06:23.589
ya know.

00:06:23.589 --> 00:06:25.357
Why can't I be a singer in cross genres?

00:06:25.357 --> 00:06:26.580
- Oh God, let's listen to the actual,

00:06:26.580 --> 00:06:27.905
there's a music video now?

00:06:27.905 --> 00:06:29.766
- It's not a music video is what she said.

00:06:29.766 --> 00:06:31.252
It's a montage of pictures.
- [Jay] One, two, three, four!

00:06:31.252 --> 00:06:32.121
- I could do it all day.

00:06:32.121 --> 00:06:33.262
(laughs)

00:06:33.262 --> 00:06:34.718
- We're gonna be doin' it all weekend!

00:06:34.718 --> 00:06:35.651
When I'm by myself in the shower.

00:06:35.651 --> 00:06:38.932
â™ª Pete Davidson! Pete Davidson â™ª

00:06:38.932 --> 00:06:43.932
â™ª Now, stand up, make it bleed,
aw yeah, you're my queen â™ª

00:06:44.408 --> 00:06:46.688
â™ª Pete Davidson â™ª

00:06:46.688 --> 00:06:49.120
â™ª You're my girl and I love â™ª

00:06:49.120 --> 00:06:50.718
- All right, let's get to the actual song.

00:06:50.718 --> 00:06:54.885
We're gonna hear it and
not our fuckin' punk song.

00:06:58.692 --> 00:07:00.438
Are these all videos that she took of him?

00:07:00.438 --> 00:07:01.271
- Yeah.

00:07:02.306 --> 00:07:04.083
â™ª I thought you into my life â™ª

00:07:04.083 --> 00:07:04.916
â™ª Look at my mind â™ª

00:07:04.916 --> 00:07:06.350
(laughing)

00:07:06.350 --> 00:07:07.451
- This is so weird

00:07:07.451 --> 00:07:09.510
- It's very, It's just weird
from our perspective 'cuz...

00:07:09.510 --> 00:07:10.471
- [Jay] I mean, It's adorable.

00:07:10.471 --> 00:07:13.518
But it sounds really weird.

00:07:13.518 --> 00:07:14.351
- Yeah.

00:07:14.351 --> 00:07:15.559
- I feel like Pete left
his phone here and I

00:07:15.559 --> 00:07:16.841
looked through it and the
guys were gonna be like,

00:07:16.841 --> 00:07:19.519
ah we're gonna laugh so hard,
and then we're like, aw.

00:07:19.519 --> 00:07:20.553
I don't know these days.

00:07:20.553 --> 00:07:21.386
It's makin' me uncomfortable.

00:07:21.386 --> 00:07:23.051
- No, these kids really
care about each other.

00:07:23.051 --> 00:07:25.027
- Aw, she makes him hang out
with so many gay people, I bet.

00:07:25.027 --> 00:07:26.281
(laughs)

00:07:26.281 --> 00:07:27.866
- Ah, the amount of gay people in my life

00:07:27.866 --> 00:07:30.279
has sky-rocketed significantly.

00:07:30.279 --> 00:07:33.133
- This is Ronaldo, he's
completely dope, I guess.

00:07:33.133 --> 00:07:35.781
He talks to me about a
lot of people he fucked,

00:07:35.781 --> 00:07:37.510
uncomfortably sometimes.

00:07:37.510 --> 00:07:39.931
- He goes, It's pretty
graphic about the sex.

00:07:39.931 --> 00:07:41.172
Well, I don't know.

00:07:41.172 --> 00:07:42.377
Ariana likes him.

00:07:42.377 --> 00:07:45.441
- This is Xun Shixin
Tao, he lives here also.

00:07:45.441 --> 00:07:47.484
He's a spiritual voice.

00:07:47.484 --> 00:07:48.946
- He makes us sushi.

00:07:48.946 --> 00:07:50.356
(laughs)

00:07:50.356 --> 00:07:52.236
- He makes a kind of fish that, like,

00:07:52.236 --> 00:07:53.945
if he cuts it wrong, we die.

00:07:53.945 --> 00:07:55.891
- It's, you're not gonna
like what I'm gonna do,

00:07:55.891 --> 00:07:57.445
but this is the part that
I want to talk about is,

00:07:57.445 --> 00:07:59.685
you called me and you're
like, listen for the end.

00:07:59.685 --> 00:08:01.292
It's only a minute and forty-five seconds.

00:08:01.292 --> 00:08:03.237
Of course they're doing
all that punk shit.

00:08:03.237 --> 00:08:04.420
(laughs)

00:08:04.420 --> 00:08:05.406
- You were like, dude, listen for the end

00:08:05.406 --> 00:08:07.585
because it sounds like
she's saying uppy uppy.

00:08:07.585 --> 00:08:08.768
- I wanna be uppy uppy.

00:08:08.768 --> 00:08:11.248
- I wanna be uppy uppy and
you said you texted him

00:08:11.248 --> 00:08:14.027
and he was like, no, the song.

00:08:14.027 --> 00:08:15.027
- That's not.

00:08:15.027 --> 00:08:15.936
- That's not what it was.

00:08:15.936 --> 00:08:16.769
- I mean, he laughs.

00:08:16.769 --> 00:08:17.602
He enjoyed the uppy uppy, I guess.

00:08:17.602 --> 00:08:20.588
- Here's the thing, when we
sent the clip of the Ariana,

00:08:20.588 --> 00:08:22.501
of me calling her Arry-anny-granny.

00:08:22.501 --> 00:08:23.508
- Airy-anna-grandy.

00:08:23.508 --> 00:08:25.035
- Airy-anna-grandy and he was like, yeah.

00:08:25.035 --> 00:08:27.324
We listened to it and we were laughing,

00:08:27.324 --> 00:08:29.963
and you're like, oh, yeah, hey, what's up.

00:08:29.963 --> 00:08:32.960
(laughing)

00:08:32.960 --> 00:08:35.616
- You were like that,
like, weird older dude,

00:08:35.616 --> 00:08:37.470
where you go, man, I'm cool.

00:08:37.470 --> 00:08:38.303
- God damn, that stuff's annoying.

00:08:38.303 --> 00:08:39.694
- [Dan] You guys went over there,

00:08:39.694 --> 00:08:40.718
you guys hung out at the apartment.

00:08:40.718 --> 00:08:41.755
- I felt so old.

00:08:41.755 --> 00:08:42.955
- [Dan] Let's play the part of the song

00:08:42.955 --> 00:08:44.532
where you can hear her go uppy.

00:08:44.532 --> 00:08:45.939
She put out this video?

00:08:45.939 --> 00:08:48.356
- Yeah, no, this is like her.

00:08:49.858 --> 00:08:53.207
- A video of the time
Pete attacked a gay guy.

00:08:53.207 --> 00:08:54.461
- Yeah, it was shocked by 'em.

00:08:54.461 --> 00:08:55.988
- [Jay] Don't touch me, homo.

00:08:55.988 --> 00:08:58.654
- Good for Pete, he got
some shoulders on him.

00:08:58.654 --> 00:08:59.695
- Oh, yeah.

00:08:59.695 --> 00:09:02.513
- That's gotta be awful
just to come out of

00:09:02.513 --> 00:09:05.266
every building and just.

00:09:05.266 --> 00:09:06.099
- Bee line for the car.

00:09:06.099 --> 00:09:07.743
- She's had it her entire life.

00:09:07.743 --> 00:09:09.719
She doesn't know anything else.

00:09:09.719 --> 00:09:11.722
- I get that at VFW wrestling events.

00:09:11.722 --> 00:09:13.138
(laughing)

00:09:13.138 --> 00:09:13.971
- You go, "Big Jay!"

00:09:13.971 --> 00:09:15.405
He goes, "Just let me live."

00:09:15.405 --> 00:09:18.177
- Yo, hey man, can I
just go take a piss, man,

00:09:18.177 --> 00:09:19.896
without having to be a whole thing?

00:09:19.896 --> 00:09:20.729
There's already, that's
been five people tonight.

00:09:20.729 --> 00:09:22.088
- [Christine] Here's to Pete. (laughs)

00:09:22.088 --> 00:09:24.562
- Yeah, wait where's the uppy part?

00:09:24.562 --> 00:09:26.018
- We're gonna bounce on that thing.

00:09:26.018 --> 00:09:27.719
â™ª I'ma be happy, happy. â™ª

00:09:27.719 --> 00:09:28.886
- There it is.

00:09:29.734 --> 00:09:33.575
â™ª Wanna be uppy â™ª

00:09:33.575 --> 00:09:35.368
â™ª Gotta be uppy uppy â™ª

00:09:35.368 --> 00:09:37.954
- I can't believe that's
Pete's girlfriend. (laughs)

00:09:37.954 --> 00:09:40.151
- It's just weird 'cuz it's
like your friend's girlfriend

00:09:40.151 --> 00:09:42.406
and she's like writing a song about him.

00:09:42.406 --> 00:09:43.952
Like, if someone was like

00:09:43.952 --> 00:09:45.573
â™ª Garrapay â™ª

00:09:45.573 --> 00:09:50.558
(mumbles) (laughing)

00:09:50.558 --> 00:09:52.665
You know like you spoke
about one of my best friends

00:09:52.665 --> 00:09:53.809
to this day and he's like

00:09:53.809 --> 00:09:55.761
â™ª I love Garrapay â™ª

00:09:55.761 --> 00:09:57.125
I love him, too.

00:09:57.125 --> 00:09:59.741
â™ª Benji Klapholz â™ª

00:09:59.741 --> 00:10:02.005
â™ª You are the boy of my dreams â™ª

00:10:02.005 --> 00:10:03.788
â™ª Benji Klapholz â™ª

00:10:03.788 --> 00:10:05.088
(laughing)

00:10:05.088 --> 00:10:08.211
â™ª I love you, Fu Jack â™ª

00:10:08.211 --> 00:10:10.461
(laughing)

00:10:12.524 --> 00:10:16.824
â™ª Dwan Nials, you are Dwan Nials â™ª

00:10:16.824 --> 00:10:19.002
â™ª You're the man of my heart â™ª

00:10:19.002 --> 00:10:21.241
Something that I can't get
out of my head that you said

00:10:21.241 --> 00:10:25.158
when you hung out at
their apartment with them,

00:10:26.684 --> 00:10:28.281
whenever I think about this
it always makes me laugh,

00:10:28.281 --> 00:10:30.149
is that you said you'd just
be in another room with Pete

00:10:30.149 --> 00:10:31.548
and just out of the room
you could hear, like

00:10:31.548 --> 00:10:33.847
â™ª Ohhh â™ª

00:10:33.847 --> 00:10:34.725
Yeah!

00:10:34.725 --> 00:10:36.319
You gotta live with that!

00:10:36.319 --> 00:10:37.633
- That's gotta be a dream come true.

00:10:37.633 --> 00:10:40.164
- Like the way you gotta live
with a comic be like, blah!

00:10:40.164 --> 00:10:42.056
You fuckin' ya dick!

00:10:42.056 --> 00:10:42.889
Like you just gotta.

00:10:42.889 --> 00:10:43.791
- Well, I'll tell you,

00:10:43.791 --> 00:10:45.784
and I hope he didn't mind me saying this,

00:10:45.784 --> 00:10:48.990
it was such a great sentence he said.

00:10:48.990 --> 00:10:51.254
I go, "so how's it like, dude?"

00:10:51.254 --> 00:10:53.986
He goes, he goes, "ay, you
know how good you think it is?

00:10:53.986 --> 00:10:55.091
"it's way better."

00:10:55.091 --> 00:10:55.924
- That's awesome.

00:10:55.924 --> 00:10:57.230
- I was like, right, he goes,

00:10:57.230 --> 00:10:59.445
"it's so much better than that even."

00:10:59.445 --> 00:11:00.692
And you would, you'd just hear her, like,

00:11:00.692 --> 00:11:02.739
hittin' notes and it was great.

00:11:02.739 --> 00:11:04.114
- [Christine] And they're
like giggly in love.

00:11:04.114 --> 00:11:05.475
- They're so lovey-dovey happy.

00:11:05.475 --> 00:11:07.108
- But I'm wondering,
like, you know, let's say

00:11:07.108 --> 00:11:10.287
this goes 15 - 20 years, and
they're married, and he goes,

00:11:10.287 --> 00:11:13.423
"hey honey, I'm tryna' have
a conversation in here.

00:11:13.423 --> 00:11:17.907
"I know you're, (coughs)
writin' another song about me.

00:11:17.907 --> 00:11:19.584
"This time I don't
think it's so positive."

00:11:19.584 --> 00:11:20.843
(laughs)

00:11:20.843 --> 00:11:25.088
- "I'm writin' Pete Davidson
part three and four right now."

00:11:25.088 --> 00:11:26.069
- She goes, "It's my open."

00:11:26.069 --> 00:11:30.163
â™ª All and all, you were just
Pete Davidson in the wall. â™ª

00:11:30.163 --> 00:11:30.996
- He goes,

00:11:30.996 --> 00:11:35.427
â™ª And now you're back to me â™ª

00:11:35.427 --> 00:11:39.510
â™ª I'm in love with Pete Davidson â™ª

00:11:40.648 --> 00:11:41.481
Look at Jacob.

00:11:41.481 --> 00:11:44.972
Just stares at that screen when she's on.

00:11:44.972 --> 00:11:47.063
She's perfect sized for you, Jacob.

00:11:47.063 --> 00:11:48.227
Here's the problem,

00:11:48.227 --> 00:11:49.060
- She's with Pete.

00:11:49.060 --> 00:11:50.085
- she love's Pete.

00:11:50.085 --> 00:11:51.726
- Like, she loves him a lot, dude.

00:11:51.726 --> 00:11:53.165
- I mean, she's way into him.

00:11:53.165 --> 00:11:54.773
You couldn't even keep up.

00:11:54.773 --> 00:11:57.566
- I'm really happy for the both of them.

00:11:57.566 --> 00:11:58.668
Yeah, you know what I heard?

00:11:58.668 --> 00:12:01.388
Pete just texted me that
she bought him a shark.

00:12:01.388 --> 00:12:03.638
(laughing)

00:12:07.456 --> 00:12:08.957
- Very happy for him, yeah.

00:12:08.957 --> 00:12:09.790
- He goes,

00:12:09.790 --> 00:12:12.167
"I don't know, Ariana got
me shark-riding lessons."

00:12:12.167 --> 00:12:14.705
- (laughs) Yeah, we have a pet.

00:12:14.705 --> 00:12:17.506
He goes, "Pete, is that a
saddle on a shark in that tank?"

00:12:17.506 --> 00:12:18.558
He goes, "Yeah,

00:12:18.558 --> 00:12:20.706
(mumbles) didn't even know
you could ride sharks."

00:12:20.706 --> 00:12:25.706
- Yo, Ricky started a saddle
for sharks business. (mumbles)

00:12:27.040 --> 00:12:28.458
- Fashionable.

00:12:28.458 --> 00:12:33.125
Ricky and his wife started a
high-fashion shark saddles.

00:12:36.684 --> 00:12:38.296
- Yeah, look at this performance.

00:12:38.296 --> 00:12:39.129
You didn't watch the thing.

00:12:39.129 --> 00:12:40.641
You should look at her performance, man.

00:12:40.641 --> 00:12:45.042
It really is, like, I don't
think the song's for me

00:12:45.042 --> 00:12:47.729
as a 40-year-old white dude
- What?

00:12:47.729 --> 00:12:49.996
The performance is unbelievable.

00:12:49.996 --> 00:12:52.663
She can all right, man, she's
so talented of a singer.

00:12:52.663 --> 00:12:55.277
All right, turn it off before
Jacob creams his shorts.

00:12:55.277 --> 00:12:57.328
- He goes, "It's happening again.

00:12:57.328 --> 00:12:58.748
"Insides are coming outside."

00:12:58.748 --> 00:13:00.230
- He's like, "oh God, I'm 'bout to poof.

00:13:00.230 --> 00:13:01.063
"I'm about to poof!"

00:13:01.063 --> 00:13:01.896
(laughing)

00:13:01.896 --> 00:13:03.457
- "Oh no I'm gonna ink!

00:13:03.457 --> 00:13:05.839
"I'm gonna ink right here.

00:13:05.839 --> 00:13:06.716
"I can't"

00:13:06.716 --> 00:13:09.243
- "Oh no, poof's coming!

00:13:09.243 --> 00:13:10.190
"Poof's coming!"

00:13:10.190 --> 00:13:12.683
- Yeah, she's insanely talented.

00:13:12.683 --> 00:13:15.253
- She's insanely talented.

00:13:15.253 --> 00:13:18.138
- And she's fuckin' gorgeous.

00:13:18.138 --> 00:13:20.653
- And she's gorgeous
and insanely talented.

00:13:20.653 --> 00:13:22.093
And that's why she's Ariana Grande.

00:13:22.093 --> 00:13:23.632
- [Jay] Hell yeah.

00:13:23.632 --> 00:13:26.199
That's why she's my niece, Ariana Grande.

00:13:26.199 --> 00:13:27.952
- And Pete has to pause Madden.

00:13:27.952 --> 00:13:29.641
It's just weird to know your friend, like,

00:13:29.641 --> 00:13:31.756
Pete's texting me, like,
"we all play Madden."

00:13:31.756 --> 00:13:34.312
- She's like, "Baby, is
this a sexy dance move?"

00:13:34.312 --> 00:13:35.845
- He goes, "it's pretty good baby,

00:13:35.845 --> 00:13:36.900
"you could probably do better.

00:13:36.900 --> 00:13:37.733
"What's up dudes!"

00:13:37.733 --> 00:13:38.566
(laughing)

00:13:38.566 --> 00:13:41.724
- He goes, "hey Gorgeous,
do you wanna play Madden?"

00:13:41.724 --> 00:13:43.515
- He goes, "I don't know, babe,

00:13:43.515 --> 00:13:45.235
"I mean, I guess you're
not practicing enough,

00:13:45.235 --> 00:13:47.773
"but you'll figure it out
at some point, I mean.

00:13:47.773 --> 00:13:49.411
"Hey, what's up Fart-bitch."

00:13:49.411 --> 00:13:50.887
- "I don't think the lyric

00:13:50.887 --> 00:13:54.118
"'love is a mystic forest' makes sense.

00:13:54.118 --> 00:13:56.712
"I don't know, you hit random three times,

00:13:56.712 --> 00:13:59.575
"and if you do a fourth time
you have to keep the team."

00:13:59.575 --> 00:14:04.575
- "Which just sounds a lot
like (mumbles) lose people."

00:14:05.730 --> 00:14:06.563
(heavy metal music)

00:14:06.563 --> 00:14:09.313
(fire crackling)

00:14:10.246 --> 00:14:12.496
(beeping)
