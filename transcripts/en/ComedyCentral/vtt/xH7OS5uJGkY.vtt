UNDERREPORTING AND
BAD MEDIA ARE ONLY TWO OF

00:00:04.036 --> 00:00:06.906 size:84% position:42% line:91%
THE MANY SYSTEMIC ISSUES
THAT AMERICA'S RAPE VICTIMS

00:00:06.939 --> 00:00:08.608 align:start position:0% line:85%
HAVE TO CONTEND WITH.

00:00:08.641 --> 00:00:10.109 align:start position:0% line:91%
SAMANTHA BEE FILES THIS
REPORT.

00:00:10.142 --> 00:00:12.645 align:start position:0% line:91%
&gt;&gt; AMERICA FACES A LITANY OF
COMPLEX PROBLEMS THAT WE

00:00:12.678 --> 00:00:14.580 size:81% position:41% line:85%
CAN'T AGREE ON HOW TO FIX.

00:00:14.613 --> 00:00:17.083 align:start position:0% line:91%
OUR CRUMBABLING
INFRASTRUCTURE, SIMPLIFYING

00:00:17.116 --> 00:00:20.720 align:start position:0% line:91%
OUR BLOATED TAX CODE, IS
SCIENCE EVEN REAL?

00:00:20.753 --> 00:00:21.788 align:start position:0% line:85%
HARD STUFF.

00:00:21.821 --> 00:00:25.024 align:start position:0% line:91%
BUT CONGRESSWOMAN DEBBIE
WASSERMAN-SCHULTZ THINKS SHE

00:00:25.057 --> 00:00:28.494 align:start position:0% line:91%
HAS AN ISSUE THAT NO ONE CAN
DISAGREE WITH.

00:00:28.527 --> 00:00:32.565 align:start position:0% line:91%
&gt;&gt; RIGHT NOW A WOMAN DOESN'T
HAVE THE RIGHT ACROSS

00:00:32.598 --> 00:00:36.202 size:78% position:39% line:91%
AMERICA TO TERMINATE HER
RAPIST'S PARENTAL RIGHTS.

00:00:36.235 --> 00:00:37.270 size:75% position:38% line:85%
&gt;&gt; NO, THAT IS NOT TRUE.

00:00:37.303 --> 00:00:40.073 align:start position:0% line:91%
&gt;&gt; IF YOU ARE THE VICTIM OF
RAPE AND YOU CONCEIVE A

00:00:40.106 --> 00:00:44.277 size:78% position:39% line:91%
CHILD, THEN YOU SHOULD BE
ABLE TO TERMINATE YOUR

00:00:44.310 --> 00:00:45.778 size:78% position:39% line:85%
RAPIST'S PARENTAL RIGHTS.

00:00:45.811 --> 00:00:48.047 size:78% position:39% line:91%
&gt;&gt; SO WE'RE TALKING ABOUT
CUSTODY, TALKING ABOUT

00:00:48.080 --> 00:00:48.581 align:start position:0% line:85%
VISITATION.

00:00:48.614 --> 00:00:49.682 align:start position:0% line:85%
&gt;&gt; YES.

00:00:49.715 --> 00:00:51.717 size:84% position:42% line:91%
&gt;&gt; EVERY OTHER WEEKEND YOU
HAVE TO MEET YOUR RAPIST IN

00:00:51.750 --> 00:00:53.820 align:start position:0% line:91%
A DENNY'S PARKING LOT AND HAND
OVER YOUR CHILD.

00:00:53.853 --> 00:00:54.387 align:start position:0% line:85%
&gt;&gt; EXACTLY. RIGHT.

00:00:54.420 --> 00:00:55.521 align:start position:0% line:85%
&gt;&gt; THIS CANNOT BE REAL.

00:00:55.554 --> 00:00:58.291 size:75% position:38% line:91%
NO, THAT DOESN'T HAPPEN,
NO, I REFUSE TO BELIEVE

00:00:58.324 --> 00:00:59.259 align:start position:0% line:85%
THAT.

00:00:59.292 --> 00:01:02.495 align:start position:0% line:91%
&gt;&gt; I SPENT TWO YEARS OF MY
OWN LIFE FIGHTING MY

00:01:02.528 --> 00:01:05.465 align:start position:0% line:91%
ATTACKER FOR CUSTODY OF MY
DAUGHTER.

00:01:05.498 --> 00:01:07.433 align:start position:0% line:91%
AND IT'S WHAT PROMPTED ME TO GO
TO LAW SCHOOL.

00:01:07.466 --> 00:01:10.303 align:start position:0% line:91%
&gt;&gt; OKAY, SO THIS ACTUALLY IS
A THING.

00:01:10.336 --> 00:01:13.873 line:91%
AND SHAUNA PREWITT HAS BEEN A
PUBLIC ADVOCATE TO END THIS

00:01:13.906 --> 00:01:17.043 align:start position:0% line:91%
UN[BLEEP] BELIEVABLE
SITUATION.

00:01:17.076 --> 00:01:20.947 align:start position:0% line:91%
&gt;&gt; WE KNOW THAT ABOUT 32,000
WOMEN EACH YEAR BECOME

00:01:20.980 --> 00:01:22.015 align:start position:0% line:85%
PREGNANT THROUGH RAPE.

00:01:22.048 --> 00:01:25.451 align:start position:0% line:91%
AT LEAST A THIRD OF THEM GO
ON TO RAISE THAT CHILD.

00:01:25.484 --> 00:01:29.522 align:start position:0% line:91%
SO WE'RE LOOKING AT, YOU KNOW,
AT LEAST 10,000 POTENTIAL

00:01:29.555 --> 00:01:31.424 align:start position:0% line:91%
CUSTODY BATTLES EVERY SINGLE
YEAR IN THIS COUNTRY.

00:01:31.457 --> 00:01:33.059 align:start position:0% line:91%
&gt;&gt; OH, THAT'S VERY
INTERESTING.

00:01:33.092 --> 00:01:35.328 line:85%
OKAY, EXCUSE ME JUST ONE SECOND.

00:01:35.361 --> 00:01:38.331 align:start position:0% line:85%
JUST BE RIGHT BACK.

00:01:38.364 --> 00:01:40.900 align:start position:0% line:85%
(SCREAMING)

00:01:40.933 --> 00:01:43.202 align:start position:0% line:91%
PREWITT'S NUMBERS WERE MAKING MY
BRAIN EXPLODE.

00:01:43.235 --> 00:01:45.671 align:start position:0% line:91%
I WAS GOING TO NEED A LITTLE
HELP GETTING THROUGH THIS

00:01:45.704 --> 00:01:46.705 align:start position:0% line:85%
STORY.

00:01:46.739 --> 00:01:49.942 align:start position:0% line:91%
LUCKILY I WAS PREPARED FOR
JUST SUCH AN EMERGENCY.

00:01:49.975 --> 00:01:52.512 align:start position:0% line:91%
EMOTIONAL SUPPORT BABY
CHICKENS.

00:01:52.545 --> 00:01:56.149 align:start position:0% line:91%
THE GOOD NEWS IS
WASSERMAN-SCHULTZ INTRODUCED

00:01:56.182 --> 00:01:57.316 size:75% position:38% line:85%
LEGISLATION TO FIX THIS.

00:01:57.349 --> 00:01:58.951 align:start position:0% line:91%
&gt;&gt; WE DO HAVE BIPARTISAN
SUPPORT.

00:01:58.984 --> 00:02:02.588 align:start position:0% line:91%
THIS BILL IS ENDORSED BY
PRO-LIFE GROUPS AND

00:02:02.621 --> 00:02:04.023 align:start position:0% line:85%
PRO-CHOICE GROUPS.

00:02:04.056 --> 00:02:08.261 align:start position:0% line:91%
I EXPECTED THAT IF THERE WAS
ANY ISSUE THAT WOULD SAIL

00:02:08.294 --> 00:02:10.997 size:81% position:41% line:91%
THROUGH WITHOUT A PROBLEM,
THAT IT WOULD BE THIS ONE.

00:02:11.030 --> 00:02:14.167 align:start position:0% line:91%
BUT THE BILL DIDN'T EVEN GET
A HEARING.

00:02:14.200 --> 00:02:15.368 align:start position:0% line:85%
&gt;&gt; OKAY, NO, NOPE.

00:02:15.401 --> 00:02:17.370 size:78% position:39% line:85%
&gt;&gt; THE PARENTAL RIGHTS --

00:02:17.403 --> 00:02:18.571 align:start position:0% line:91%
&gt;&gt; IT'S GOING
TO BE OKAY.

00:02:18.604 --> 00:02:19.772 align:start position:0% line:85%
IT'S GOING TO BE OKAY.

00:02:19.805 --> 00:02:22.408 align:start position:0% line:91%
SO WHY DID THIS CAN'T FAIL
BILL FAIL?

00:02:22.441 --> 00:02:25.645 align:start position:0% line:91%
&gt;&gt; THERE IS A SMALL
PROVISION IN THE BILL THAT

00:02:25.678 --> 00:02:27.813 size:84% position:42% line:85%
ACTUALLY SPENDS SOME MONEY.

00:02:27.846 --> 00:02:31.150 size:78% position:39% line:91%
THE BILL DIDN'T MOVE OVER
THIS SMALL FUNDING ISSUE.

00:02:31.183 --> 00:02:31.784 align:start position:0% line:85%
&gt;&gt; SMALL FUNDING, OKAY.

00:02:31.817 --> 00:02:33.186 size:88% position:44% line:85%
SO THIS IS A WEIRD QUESTION.

00:02:33.219 --> 00:02:36.856 size:81% position:41% line:91%
BUT HOW MUCH MONEY IS TOO
MUCH MONEY TO STOP RAPISTS

00:02:36.889 --> 00:02:38.991 align:start position:0% line:91%
FROM PURSUING THEIR
CUSTODIAL RIGHTS.

00:02:39.024 --> 00:02:39.992 align:start position:0% line:91%
&gt;&gt; WELL, LET ME SHARE THE WITH
YOU.

00:02:40.025 --> 00:02:40.560 align:start position:0% line:91%
THE BILL AUTHORIZED $5
MILLION PER YEAR FOR FIVE

00:02:40.593 --> 00:02:42.395 align:start position:0% line:85%
YEARS.

00:02:42.428 --> 00:02:44.130 align:start position:0% line:85%
&gt;&gt; FOR [BLEEP] SAKE.

00:02:44.163 --> 00:02:46.365 align:start position:0% line:91%
DO YOU KNOW HOW MUCH THE
GOVERNMENT SPENDS ON

00:02:46.398 --> 00:02:49.802 align:start position:0% line:91%
PROMOTING FRUITS AND
VEGETABLES ON SOCIAL MEDIA?

00:02:49.835 --> 00:02:53.873 line:85%
$5 MILLION A YEAR, #GETFRUVED.

00:02:53.906 --> 00:02:55.408 align:start position:0% line:91%
SO WE'RE COOL WITH TEAM GRAPES
BUT NOT TEAM HELPING

00:02:55.441 --> 00:02:58.010 align:start position:0% line:85%
RAPE VICTIMS? GOT IT.

00:02:58.043 --> 00:03:02.682 align:start position:0% line:91%
IN THE MEANTIME
WASSERMAN-SCHULTZ HAS

00:03:02.715 --> 00:03:03.416 align:start position:0% line:91%
RE-INTRODUCED HER
BILL AND THINKS THAT THIS TIME

00:03:03.449 --> 00:03:04.484 align:start position:0%
IT MAY PASS.

00:03:04.517 --> 00:03:06.719 align:start position:0% line:91%
&gt;&gt; IF IT PASSES THEN NO
WOMAN WILL EVER HAVE TO FACE

00:03:06.752 --> 00:03:09.255 align:start position:0% line:91%
THIS NIGHTMARE EVER AGAIN,
PROBLEM SOLVED, RIGHT?

00:03:09.288 --> 00:03:10.856 align:start position:0% line:91%
&gt;&gt; WELL, I WISH IT WERE THAT
SIMPLE.

00:03:10.889 --> 00:03:11.557 align:start position:0% line:85%
BUT IT'S NOT AUTOMATIC.

00:03:11.590 --> 00:03:12.691 line:85%
IT IS ACTUALLY UP TO THE STATES.

00:03:12.724 --> 00:03:15.127 align:start position:0% line:91%
SO WHAT WE DO IN THE BILL IS WE
INCENTIVIZE STATES THAT

00:03:15.160 --> 00:03:16.996 align:start position:0% line:91%
DON'T HAVE THIS LAW IN
PLACE.

00:03:17.029 --> 00:03:19.932 align:start position:0% line:91%
WE HAVE TO EITHER USE A
CARROT OR A STICK.

00:03:19.965 --> 00:03:21.634 align:start position:0% line:91%
IN THIS CASE WE CHOSE A
CARROT.

00:03:21.667 --> 00:03:23.970 align:start position:0% line:91%
&gt;&gt; I FEEL LIKE I WOULD HAVE
CHOSEN THE STICK.

00:03:24.003 --> 00:03:26.639 align:start position:0% line:91%
&gt;&gt; I KNOW, THE STICK CAN BE
TEMPTING.

00:03:26.672 --> 00:03:29.208 size:84% position:42% line:91%
&gt;&gt; SO CONSTITUTIONALLY EACH
STATE HAS TO CHANGE ITS OWN

00:03:29.241 --> 00:03:31.777 size:78% position:39% line:91%
LAWS. QUICK QUESTION, WHY
THE [BLEEP] DO THE STATES

00:03:31.810 --> 00:03:34.714 align:start position:0% line:85%
EVEN NEED AN INCENTIVE?

00:03:34.747 --> 00:03:39.085 size:84% position:42% line:91%
&gt;&gt; I THINK THAT THE PROBLEM
IS THAT IT GOES BACK TO THE

00:03:39.118 --> 00:03:41.554 align:start position:0% line:91%
SUSPICION THAT LEGISLATORS
HAVE OF RAPED WOMEN.

00:03:41.587 --> 00:03:46.192 align:start position:0% line:91%
AND NOT ONLY THAT, SOME
WOMEN HAVE BEEN THREATENED

00:03:46.225 --> 00:03:50.796 align:start position:0% line:91%
BY THEIR ATTACKERS WHO HAVE
SAID IF YOU STOP THE

00:03:50.829 --> 00:03:54.567 size:88% position:44% line:91%
CRIMINAL PROCESS AGAINST ME
I WILL AGREE NOT TO SEEK ANY

00:03:54.600 --> 00:03:56.602 size:84% position:42% line:85%
CUSTODY OF PARENTAL RIGHTS.

00:03:56.635 --> 00:04:00.006 align:start position:0% line:91%
&gt;&gt; I'M JUST GOING TO GO GET SOME
FRESH AIR.

00:04:00.039 --> 00:04:01.440 align:start position:0% line:85%
THAT'S IT, I'M OUT.

00:04:01.473 --> 00:04:02.441 align:start position:0% line:85%
I'M OUT OF SHOCK.

00:04:02.474 --> 00:04:06.112 align:start position:0% line:91%
OKAY, JUST WALK AND THINK,
THINK AND WALK, OKAY.

00:04:06.145 --> 00:04:07.246 align:start position:0% line:85%
WHOOO.

00:04:07.280 --> 00:04:09.682 size:88% position:44% line:91%
NOBODY SHOULD HAVE TO CHOOSE
BETWEEN DROPPING CHARGES OR

00:04:09.715 --> 00:04:11.284 align:start position:0% line:85%
A CUSTODY BATTLE.

00:04:11.317 --> 00:04:12.151 align:start position:0% line:85%
OH MY GOD.

00:04:12.184 --> 00:04:13.052 align:start position:0% line:85%
OH MY GOD.

00:04:13.085 --> 00:04:13.853 align:start position:0% line:85%
WHERE AM I?

00:04:13.886 --> 00:04:16.289 align:start position:0% line:85%
OH, THIS IS PRETTY.

00:04:16.322 --> 00:04:17.657 align:start position:0% line:85%
SO SNOWY.

00:04:17.690 --> 00:04:19.358 align:start position:0% line:85%
NOT INFURIATINGLY SAD.

00:04:19.391 --> 00:04:21.994 align:start position:0% line:91%
YOU KNOW WHAT, WHY WOULD I
LEAVE?

00:04:22.027 --> 00:04:23.529 align:start position:0% line:85%
I'LL JUST ENJOY MY TEA.

00:04:23.562 --> 00:04:24.730 align:start position:0% line:85%
GROW A BEARD.

00:04:24.763 --> 00:04:28.868 size:84% position:42% line:91%
WOULD YOU LOOK AT THE LACK
OF SOUL-CRUSHING GOVERNMENT

00:04:28.901 --> 00:04:29.535 align:start position:0% line:85%
DYSFUNCTION?

00:04:29.569 --> 00:04:34.240 line:85%
I COULD MAKE A NEW LIFE HERE.

00:04:34.273 --> 00:04:34.740 align:start position:0% line:85%
&gt;&gt; SAM.

00:04:34.774 --> 00:04:37.476 align:start position:0% line:85%
&gt;&gt; WHAT DO YOU WANT?

00:04:37.509 --> 00:04:39.845 align:start position:0% line:91%
&gt;&gt; IT'S HASAN MINHAJ FROM THE
DAILY SHOW.

00:04:39.878 --> 00:04:40.713 align:start position:0% line:85%
&gt;&gt; I KNOW WHO YOU ARE.

00:04:40.746 --> 00:04:42.148 align:start position:0% line:91%
&gt;&gt; YOU NEED TO FINISH THE
PIECE.

00:04:42.181 --> 00:04:43.282 size:78% position:39% line:85%
&gt;&gt; I'M TO THE GOING BACK.

00:04:43.315 --> 00:04:46.385 align:start position:0% line:85%
&gt;&gt; BUT IT'S IMPORTANT.

00:04:46.418 --> 00:04:48.487 size:78% position:39% line:85%
&gt;&gt; I KNOW IT'S IMPORTANT.

00:04:48.520 --> 00:04:49.188 align:start position:0% line:85%
GODDAMN IT.

00:04:49.221 --> 00:04:50.923 align:start position:0% line:91%
&gt;&gt; THERE WAS STILL WORK TO
DO.

00:04:50.956 --> 00:04:52.792 align:start position:0% line:91%
LISTEN, CAN I BORROW YOUR
RAZOR?

00:04:52.825 --> 00:04:55.594 align:start position:0% line:91%
&gt;&gt; I LEFT THAT LADY SITTING
THERE FOR A LONG TIME.

00:04:55.627 --> 00:04:56.829 align:start position:0% line:85%
&gt;&gt; OKAY, HERE WE GO.

00:04:56.862 --> 00:04:59.131 size:84% position:42% line:91%
ARE THERE ANY STATES OUT
THERE DOING THE RIGHT THING

00:04:59.164 --> 00:05:02.601 align:start position:0% line:85%
ON THEIR OWN?

00:05:02.634 --> 00:05:04.503 size:81% position:41% line:91%
&gt;&gt; FLORIDA NOT ONLY HAS A
LAW, IT HAS A TERRIFIC LAW

00:05:04.536 --> 00:05:05.103 line:91%
THAT'S ACTUALLY A MODEL THAT I
WOULD LIKE TO GET REPLICATED IN

00:05:05.137 --> 00:05:06.906 size:78% position:39%
A NUMBER OF OTHER STATES.

00:05:06.939 --> 00:05:08.574 size:88% position:44% line:85%
&gt;&gt; DID YOU JUST SAY FLORIDA?

00:05:08.607 --> 00:05:09.675 align:start position:0% line:85%
&gt;&gt; YEAH.

00:05:09.708 --> 00:05:11.977 size:84% position:42% line:91%
&gt;&gt; I'VE BEEN DOING THIS JOB
FOR A LONG TIME AND I HAVE

00:05:12.010 --> 00:05:14.814 align:start position:0% line:91%
NEVER SAID THESE WORDS
BEFORE.

00:05:14.847 --> 00:05:17.683 align:start position:0% line:85%
GOOD JOB, FLORIDA!

00:05:17.716 --> 00:05:19.485 size:75% position:38% line:85%
I KNEW WHAT I HAD TO DO.

00:05:19.518 --> 00:05:23.189 align:start position:0% line:91%
TIME FOR A GOOD
OLD-FASHIONED STATE-SHAMING.

00:05:23.222 --> 00:05:24.290 align:start position:0% line:85%
&gt;&gt; HI.

00:05:24.323 --> 00:05:26.659 align:start position:0% line:91%
IF YOUR STATE IS RED ON THIS
MAP, CALL YOUR LEGISLATOR

00:05:26.692 --> 00:05:29.595 align:start position:0% line:91%
AND TELL THEM TO GET THEIR
[BLEEP] TOGETHER.

00:05:29.628 --> 00:05:31.530 align:start position:0% line:91%
DON'T LIKE MAPS? HERE ARE THEIR
NAMES.

00:05:31.563 --> 00:05:39.739 align:start position:0% line:91%
