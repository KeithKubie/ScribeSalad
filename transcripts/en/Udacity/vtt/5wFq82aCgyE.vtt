00:00:00.220 --> 00:00:02.680
This is the correct notation.

00:00:02.680 --> 00:00:07.710
You may have noticed that all of these
are equivalent to our original number,

00:00:07.710 --> 00:00:10.280
but only this one is in
the correct notation.

00:00:11.380 --> 00:00:15.300
In scientific notation there
should only be one number

00:00:15.300 --> 00:00:17.070
on the left of the decimal point.

00:00:18.120 --> 00:00:21.420
It doesn't really matter how many
numbers are in the right of the decimal

00:00:21.420 --> 00:00:26.410
point, but usually it's no
more than two or maybe three.

00:00:26.410 --> 00:00:29.510
Another thing to note the number
on the left of the decimal

00:00:29.510 --> 00:00:30.635
point should not be 0.
