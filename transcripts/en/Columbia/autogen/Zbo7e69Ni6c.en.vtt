would have liked to seen the physical

01:40:31.689 --> 01:40:31.699
would have liked to seen the physical
 

01:40:31.699 --> 01:40:35.020
would have liked to seen the physical
examples of the preservation that you

01:40:35.020 --> 01:40:35.030
examples of the preservation that you
 

01:40:35.030 --> 01:40:38.710
examples of the preservation that you
were talking about and contrast it 20

01:40:38.710 --> 01:40:38.720
were talking about and contrast it 20
 

01:40:38.720 --> 01:40:43.510
were talking about and contrast it 20
one may be the physical maybe the the

01:40:43.510 --> 01:40:43.520
one may be the physical maybe the the
 

01:40:43.520 --> 01:40:46.180
one may be the physical maybe the the
visual examples are in all that telling

01:40:46.180 --> 01:40:46.190
visual examples are in all that telling
 

01:40:46.190 --> 01:40:48.820
visual examples are in all that telling
because maybe part of the unique

01:40:48.820 --> 01:40:48.830
because maybe part of the unique
 

01:40:48.830 --> 01:40:53.010
because maybe part of the unique
approach to preservation in bond say is

01:40:53.010 --> 01:40:53.020
approach to preservation in bond say is
 

01:40:53.020 --> 01:40:58.270
approach to preservation in bond say is
that it's not strictly based on physical

01:40:58.270 --> 01:40:58.280
that it's not strictly based on physical
 

01:40:58.280 --> 01:41:01.690
that it's not strictly based on physical
renovation and I think that's another

01:41:01.690 --> 01:41:01.700
renovation and I think that's another
 

01:41:01.700 --> 01:41:04.830
renovation and I think that's another
question I want to ask all the panelists

01:41:04.830 --> 01:41:04.840
question I want to ask all the panelists
 

01:41:04.840 --> 01:41:08.650
question I want to ask all the panelists
very much focused on the physical part

01:41:08.650 --> 01:41:08.660
very much focused on the physical part
 

01:41:08.660 --> 01:41:13.060
very much focused on the physical part
of preservation but the there seems this

01:41:13.060 --> 01:41:13.070
of preservation but the there seems this
 

01:41:13.070 --> 01:41:15.220
of preservation but the there seems this
seems to be disjointed from the

01:41:15.220 --> 01:41:15.230
seems to be disjointed from the
 

01:41:15.230 --> 01:41:18.660
seems to be disjointed from the
discussion of cultural preservation and

01:41:18.660 --> 01:41:18.670
discussion of cultural preservation and
 

01:41:18.670 --> 01:41:23.620
discussion of cultural preservation and
I think we architects and planners tend

01:41:23.620 --> 01:41:23.630
I think we architects and planners tend
 

01:41:23.630 --> 01:41:27.750
I think we architects and planners tend
to fetishize the physical without

01:41:27.750 --> 01:41:27.760
to fetishize the physical without
 

01:41:27.760 --> 01:41:29.980
to fetishize the physical without
sufficiently giving attention to the

01:41:29.980 --> 01:41:29.990
sufficiently giving attention to the
 

01:41:29.990 --> 01:41:35.740
sufficiently giving attention to the
political and the cultural and then

01:41:35.740 --> 01:41:35.750
political and the cultural and then
 

01:41:35.750 --> 01:41:41.860
political and the cultural and then
finally on buenos I days I have to

01:41:41.860 --> 01:41:41.870
finally on buenos I days I have to
 

01:41:41.870 --> 01:41:45.900
finally on buenos I days I have to
confess I am one of the persons who

01:41:45.900 --> 01:41:45.910
confess I am one of the persons who
 

01:41:45.910 --> 01:41:50.020
confess I am one of the persons who
commit this mistake all the time in the

01:41:50.020 --> 01:41:50.030
commit this mistake all the time in the
 

01:41:50.030 --> 01:41:53.530
commit this mistake all the time in the
with regard to New York City when we

01:41:53.530 --> 01:41:53.540
with regard to New York City when we
 

01:41:53.540 --> 01:41:55.300
with regard to New York City when we
talk about New York City we talked about

01:41:55.300 --> 01:41:55.310
talk about New York City we talked about
 

01:41:55.310 --> 01:41:57.430
talk about New York City we talked about
the city of New York the 8 million

01:41:57.430 --> 01:41:57.440
the city of New York the 8 million
 

01:41:57.440 --> 01:42:01.240
the city of New York the 8 million
people living in the core and I think

01:42:01.240 --> 01:42:01.250
people living in the core and I think
 

01:42:01.250 --> 01:42:03.970
people living in the core and I think
buenos itís is one of those other cities

01:42:03.970 --> 01:42:03.980
buenos itís is one of those other cities
 

01:42:03.980 --> 01:42:07.510
buenos itís is one of those other cities
in the world where when people talk

01:42:07.510 --> 01:42:07.520
in the world where when people talk
 

01:42:07.520 --> 01:42:09.280
in the world where when people talk
about Buenos itís they always talk about

01:42:09.280 --> 01:42:09.290
about Buenos itís they always talk about
 

01:42:09.290 --> 01:42:13.690
about Buenos itís they always talk about
the core as I say I make this mistake

01:42:13.690 --> 01:42:13.700
the core as I say I make this mistake
 

01:42:13.700 --> 01:42:16.330
the core as I say I make this mistake
all the time I was talked about but his

01:42:16.330 --> 01:42:16.340
all the time I was talked about but his
 

01:42:16.340 --> 01:42:18.220
all the time I was talked about but his
presence because of the historic

01:42:18.220 --> 01:42:18.230
presence because of the historic
 

01:42:18.230 --> 01:42:22.000
presence because of the historic
identity and the power of the core in

01:42:22.000 --> 01:42:22.010
identity and the power of the core in
 

01:42:22.010 --> 01:42:23.950
identity and the power of the core in
the strength of the core but the

01:42:23.950 --> 01:42:23.960
the strength of the core but the
 

01:42:23.960 --> 01:42:25.810
the strength of the core but the
majority of population in Buenos Aires

01:42:25.810 --> 01:42:25.820
majority of population in Buenos Aires
 

01:42:25.820 --> 01:42:28.810
majority of population in Buenos Aires
lives outside this city of Buenos Aires

01:42:33.370 --> 01:42:33.380
and it would have been nice to have a
 

01:42:33.380 --> 01:42:37.260
and it would have been nice to have a
discussion about the meaning of the

01:42:37.260 --> 01:42:37.270
discussion about the meaning of the
 

01:42:37.270 --> 01:42:41.830
discussion about the meaning of the
preservation of the core for those who

01:42:41.830 --> 01:42:41.840
preservation of the core for those who
 

01:42:41.840 --> 01:42:45.790
preservation of the core for those who
live outside in the periphery and with

01:42:45.790 --> 01:42:45.800
live outside in the periphery and with
 

01:42:45.800 --> 01:42:48.340

01:42:48.340 --> 01:42:48.350
regard to the question of participation
 

01:42:48.350 --> 01:42:50.170

it would have been nice i'm sorry we
didn't have more time to hear the

01:42:52.270 --> 01:42:52.280
didn't have more time to hear the
 

01:42:52.280 --> 01:42:55.330
didn't have more time to hear the
the story but the participation of the

01:42:55.330 --> 01:42:55.340
the story but the participation of the
 

01:42:55.340 --> 01:42:59.709
the story but the participation of the
middle class this is a big question also

01:42:59.709 --> 01:42:59.719
middle class this is a big question also
 

01:42:59.719 --> 01:43:03.129
middle class this is a big question also
in New York where many of the protests

01:43:03.129 --> 01:43:03.139
in New York where many of the protests
 

01:43:03.139 --> 01:43:05.439
in New York where many of the protests
and much of the community and

01:43:05.439 --> 01:43:05.449
and much of the community and
 

01:43:05.449 --> 01:43:08.020
and much of the community and
neighborhood base place-based organizing

01:43:08.020 --> 01:43:08.030
neighborhood base place-based organizing
 

01:43:08.030 --> 01:43:11.169
neighborhood base place-based organizing
is led by what are called the middle

01:43:11.169 --> 01:43:11.179
is led by what are called the middle
 

01:43:11.179 --> 01:43:13.779
is led by what are called the middle
class but quite frankly I don't know

01:43:13.779 --> 01:43:13.789
class but quite frankly I don't know
 

01:43:13.789 --> 01:43:16.390
class but quite frankly I don't know
what that is I'm not sure what the

01:43:16.390 --> 01:43:16.400
what that is I'm not sure what the
 

01:43:16.400 --> 01:43:19.660
what that is I'm not sure what the
middle class is anymore because it is

01:43:19.660 --> 01:43:19.670
middle class is anymore because it is
 

01:43:19.670 --> 01:43:24.729
middle class is anymore because it is
very heterogeneous and it includes a

01:43:24.729 --> 01:43:24.739
very heterogeneous and it includes a
 

01:43:24.739 --> 01:43:29.080
very heterogeneous and it includes a
great diversity of people at the in

01:43:29.080 --> 01:43:29.090
great diversity of people at the in
 

01:43:29.090 --> 01:43:31.689
great diversity of people at the in
different occupations different income

01:43:31.689 --> 01:43:31.699
different occupations different income
 

01:43:31.699 --> 01:43:37.990
different occupations different income
levels and so forth and there's often a

01:43:37.990 --> 01:43:38.000
levels and so forth and there's often a
 

01:43:38.000 --> 01:43:39.540
levels and so forth and there's often a
surprise that the middle class is

01:43:39.540 --> 01:43:39.550
surprise that the middle class is
 

01:43:39.550 --> 01:43:45.970
surprise that the middle class is
organizing but I'm not so sure that at I

01:43:45.970 --> 01:43:45.980
organizing but I'm not so sure that at I
 

01:43:45.980 --> 01:43:49.330
organizing but I'm not so sure that at I
think I I'm more concerned about the use

01:43:49.330 --> 01:43:49.340
think I I'm more concerned about the use
 

01:43:49.340 --> 01:43:51.910
think I I'm more concerned about the use
of that category because it is so in

01:43:51.910 --> 01:43:51.920
of that category because it is so in
 

01:43:51.920 --> 01:43:56.640
of that category because it is so in
precise in trying to make a point or

01:43:56.640 --> 01:43:56.650
precise in trying to make a point or
 

01:43:56.650 --> 01:44:01.839
precise in trying to make a point or
demonstrate something it if the

01:44:01.839 --> 01:44:01.849
demonstrate something it if the
 

01:44:01.849 --> 01:44:04.450
demonstrate something it if the
categories aren't appropriate it's going

01:44:04.450 --> 01:44:04.460
categories aren't appropriate it's going
 

01:44:04.460 --> 01:44:07.839
categories aren't appropriate it's going
to be difficult to make that make that

01:44:07.839 --> 01:44:07.849
to be difficult to make that make that
 

01:44:07.849 --> 01:44:14.950
to be difficult to make that make that
point so these are these are my comments

01:44:14.950 --> 01:44:14.960
point so these are these are my comments
 

01:44:14.960 --> 01:44:18.609
point so these are these are my comments
a little scattered but I think overall I

01:44:18.609 --> 01:44:18.619
a little scattered but I think overall I
 

01:44:18.619 --> 01:44:23.109
a little scattered but I think overall I
really appreciated the four

01:44:23.109 --> 01:44:23.119
really appreciated the four
 

01:44:23.119 --> 01:44:25.000
really appreciated the four
presentations that have a good deal of

01:44:25.000 --> 01:44:25.010
presentations that have a good deal of
 

01:44:25.010 --> 01:44:28.299
presentations that have a good deal of
overlap then I think cover some of the

01:44:28.299 --> 01:44:28.309
overlap then I think cover some of the
 

01:44:28.309 --> 01:44:31.750
overlap then I think cover some of the
big questions in a very short period of

01:44:31.750 --> 01:44:31.760
big questions in a very short period of
 

01:44:31.760 --> 01:44:38.439
big questions in a very short period of
time that ran out thanks would you come

01:44:38.439 --> 01:44:38.449
time that ran out thanks would you come
 

01:44:38.449 --> 01:45:23.290
time that ran out thanks would you come

Rockefeller stated that such

01:46:17.500 --> 01:46:17.510
Rockefeller stated that such
 

01:46:17.510 --> 01:46:19.850
Rockefeller stated that such
representations are it's a matter of

01:46:19.850 --> 01:46:19.860
representations are it's a matter of
 

01:46:19.860 --> 01:46:22.250
representations are it's a matter of
space that Rockefeller Center was a

01:46:22.250 --> 01:46:22.260
space that Rockefeller Center was a
 

01:46:22.260 --> 01:46:24.950
space that Rockefeller Center was a
