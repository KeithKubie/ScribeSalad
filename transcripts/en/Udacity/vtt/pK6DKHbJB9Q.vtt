00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.040
The last piece I want to talk about for research is intellectualy property.

00:00:04.040 --> 00:00:08.210
There are great law firms who can give you tutorials.

00:00:08.210 --> 00:00:10.210
There is plenty of stuff on the web.

00:00:10.210 --> 00:00:15.460
But the types of intellectual property, shorthand IP, you want to think about are these.

00:00:15.460 --> 00:00:18.460
There are 5. One is trademark.

00:00:18.460 --> 00:00:24.710
Trademark means what can you protect as branding. Like the Nike swoosh.

00:00:24.710 --> 00:00:28.200
The examples could be marks or logos or slogans.

00:00:28.200 --> 00:00:31.810
Other type of intellectual property could be copyright.

00:00:31.810 --> 00:00:34.200
An example is creative or authored works and expressions.

00:00:34.200 --> 00:00:40.310
You can't copyright ideas, but you can copyright software or songs or movies or website content.

00:00:40.310 --> 00:00:42.310
The other one is trade secrets.

00:00:42.310 --> 00:00:44.880
Well I don't want to patent this because someone is going to read the patent.

00:00:44.880 --> 00:00:46.880
They'll figure it out.

00:00:46.880 --> 00:00:49.820
So you might have decided that you're going to protect it in a vault.

00:00:49.820 --> 00:00:54.290
Just like the Coca Cola recipe is supposedly kept in a vault in Atlanta,

00:00:54.290 --> 00:00:56.730
and it's non-public technology.

00:00:56.730 --> 00:01:00.560
Also your customer lists might kind of fit in this category,

00:01:00.560 --> 00:01:04.930
or some secret formulas necessary for our final element in your product.

00:01:04.930 --> 00:01:09.000
Two things that startups run into all of the time are contracts or NDAs,

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:11.070
which stands for non-disclosure agreements.

00:01:11.070 --> 00:01:16.240
You know what's protectable is in the contract, that is you specify it or somebody making

00:01:16.240 --> 00:01:20.040
you sign it or offering you a contract or an NDA specifies it.

00:01:20.040 --> 00:01:23.880
Examples are technology and business information.

00:01:23.880 --> 00:01:26.840
By the way before we go forward, this is one point I want to mention.

00:01:26.840 --> 00:01:32.650
Founders sometimes naively believe that they can protect their technology from investors

00:01:32.650 --> 00:01:36.670
or potential investors by making investors sign a non-disclosure agreement.

00:01:36.670 --> 00:01:41.220
That just doesn't happen, and it's a naive view of how to protect your technology.

00:01:41.220 --> 00:01:47.980
My suggestion is, by the way, don't put your source code, your firmware, or your deep insight

00:01:47.980 --> 00:01:50.540
in the first presentation.

00:01:50.540 --> 00:01:54.130
Because you're never going to have somebody push a bag of money at you across the table

00:01:54.130 --> 00:01:56.720
over a series of Powerpoint slides.

00:01:56.720 --> 00:02:03.390
In fact if an investor is interested, and you are now in meeting 2, 3, or 4, and they say listen

00:02:03.390 --> 00:02:08.000
for us to really proceed we need to have you open the hood and let us or a consultant

00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:14.370
take a look, the next question to ask is well if we do that, and it meets these following criteria,

00:02:14.370 --> 00:02:16.740
is there an investment or not?

00:02:16.740 --> 00:02:22.380
If the answer is yes then you can make them, or at least require an NDA, because they have

00:02:22.380 --> 00:02:24.640
gone down the path of interest with you and are serious.

00:02:24.640 --> 00:02:28.150
The last piece of intellectual property is patent.

00:02:28.150 --> 00:02:31.560
U.S. patent law has changed in some important ways in the last year.

00:02:31.560 --> 00:02:35.200
If you were familiar with it it's nice to get updated with it again.

00:02:35.200 --> 00:02:37.490
What's protectable are inventions.

00:02:37.490 --> 00:02:39.960
Typical examples are new technologies.

00:02:39.960 --> 00:02:43.700
You've invented something new. Some hardware, or algorithm, or software, etc.

00:02:43.700 --> 99:59:59.000
Getting a patent is kind of important.
