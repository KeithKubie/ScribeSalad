00:00:01.310 --> 00:00:04.279
one of the overriding reasons why modern

00:00:04.279 --> 00:00:06.859
work is so boring is that we keep having

00:00:06.859 --> 00:00:09.410
to do more or less the same thing every

00:00:09.410 --> 00:00:10.880
day

00:00:10.880 --> 00:00:14.000
we have to be specialists whereas we

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:16.369
would deepen our hearts surely be so

00:00:16.369 --> 00:00:18.350
much more fulfilled if we could be

00:00:18.350 --> 00:00:20.510
wide-ranging endlessly curious

00:00:20.510 --> 00:00:23.330
generalists you can understand the

00:00:23.330 --> 00:00:25.520
origins of restlessness when you look at

00:00:25.520 --> 00:00:27.800
childhood as children we will allow to

00:00:27.800 --> 00:00:30.919
do so much in a single Saturday morning

00:00:30.919 --> 00:00:32.810
we might put on an extra jumper and

00:00:32.810 --> 00:00:34.970
imagine being an arctic explorer then

00:00:34.970 --> 00:00:37.040
have brief stints as an architect making

00:00:37.040 --> 00:00:39.320
a Lego house a rock star making up an

00:00:39.320 --> 00:00:41.480
anthem about corn flakes and an inventor

00:00:41.480 --> 00:00:43.280
working out how to speed up coloring in

00:00:43.280 --> 00:00:45.710
by gluing for felt-tip pens together

00:00:45.710 --> 00:00:47.660
we'd put in a few minutes as a member of

00:00:47.660 --> 00:00:49.970
an emergency rescue team then we try out

00:00:49.970 --> 00:00:51.710
being a pilot brilliantly landing a

00:00:51.710 --> 00:00:53.780
cargo plane on the rug in the corridor

00:00:53.780 --> 00:00:56.090
we'd perform a life-saving operation on

00:00:56.090 --> 00:00:58.190
a knitted rabbit and finally we find

00:00:58.190 --> 00:01:00.380
employment as a sous chef helping make a

00:01:00.380 --> 00:01:02.960
ham and cheese sandwich for lunch each

00:01:02.960 --> 00:01:05.449
one of these so-called games might have

00:01:05.449 --> 00:01:08.060
been the beginning of a career and yet

00:01:08.060 --> 00:01:10.880
we had to settle on only a single option

00:01:10.880 --> 00:01:15.109
done repeatedly for over 50 years we are

00:01:15.109 --> 00:01:17.539
so much more than the world of work ever

00:01:17.539 --> 00:01:20.479
allows us to be in his song of myself

00:01:20.479 --> 00:01:22.640
published in eighteen fifty five the

00:01:22.640 --> 00:01:24.920
American poet Walt Whitman gave our

00:01:24.920 --> 00:01:28.340
multiplicity memorable expression I am

00:01:28.340 --> 00:01:32.899
large I contain multitudes by which

00:01:32.899 --> 00:01:34.789
Whitman meant that there is so many

00:01:34.789 --> 00:01:36.770
interesting attractive and viable

00:01:36.770 --> 00:01:39.200
versions of oneself so many good ways

00:01:39.200 --> 00:01:41.869
one could potentially live and work but

00:01:41.869 --> 00:01:44.359
very few of these ever get properly

00:01:44.359 --> 00:01:46.729
played out and become real in the course

00:01:46.729 --> 00:01:49.759
of the single life we have no wonder if

00:01:49.759 --> 00:01:51.709
we're often conscious of our unfulfilled

00:01:51.709 --> 00:01:54.469
destinies and at times recognize with a

00:01:54.469 --> 00:01:56.749
legitimate sense of agony that we really

00:01:56.749 --> 00:01:58.759
could well have succeeded at doing

00:01:58.759 --> 00:02:01.369
something else if not our fault that

00:02:01.369 --> 00:02:03.049
we've not been able to give our

00:02:03.049 --> 00:02:05.450
multitudes expression the modern job

00:02:05.450 --> 00:02:07.579
market gives us no option but to

00:02:07.579 --> 00:02:10.280
specialize we can't be an airline pilot

00:02:10.280 --> 00:02:12.740
one afternoon a week at research in two

00:02:12.740 --> 00:02:14.660
days a month a singer-songwriter in the

00:02:14.660 --> 00:02:16.580
evenings while holding down part-time

00:02:16.580 --> 00:02:18.950
work as a political advisor a plumber a

00:02:18.950 --> 00:02:20.750
dress designer a tennis coach a travel

00:02:20.750 --> 00:02:22.520
agent and being additionally the owner

00:02:22.520 --> 00:02:23.780
of a small restaurant

00:02:23.780 --> 00:02:26.150
lebanese mezack however much this might

00:02:26.150 --> 00:02:28.880
be the ideal arrangement to do justice

00:02:28.880 --> 00:02:30.650
to our widespread interests and

00:02:30.650 --> 00:02:34.100
potential the reason or we cannot do so

00:02:34.100 --> 00:02:36.110
much were first elaborated at the end of

00:02:36.110 --> 00:02:37.790
the eighteenth century by the Scottish

00:02:37.790 --> 00:02:40.580
philosopher adam smith in the wealth of

00:02:40.580 --> 00:02:42.650
nations Smith explained how what he

00:02:42.650 --> 00:02:44.900
termed the division of labour massively

00:02:44.900 --> 00:02:47.720
increases collective productivity in a

00:02:47.720 --> 00:02:49.760
society where everyone does everything

00:02:49.760 --> 00:02:52.520
only a small number of shoes houses

00:02:52.520 --> 00:02:54.739
nails bushels of wheat horse bridles and

00:02:54.739 --> 00:02:57.560
cartwheels but ever produced and no one

00:02:57.560 --> 00:02:59.810
is especially good at anything but if

00:02:59.810 --> 00:03:02.120
people specialize in just one small area

00:03:02.120 --> 00:03:04.489
making rivets shaping spokes

00:03:04.489 --> 00:03:07.459
manufacturing rope bricklaying etc they

00:03:07.459 --> 00:03:09.410
become very much faster and more

00:03:09.410 --> 00:03:11.540
efficient in their work and collectively

00:03:11.540 --> 00:03:13.340
the level of production is greatly

00:03:13.340 --> 00:03:16.130
increased by focusing our efforts we

00:03:16.130 --> 00:03:17.480
lose out on the enjoyment of

00:03:17.480 --> 00:03:20.090
multiplicity yet our society becomes

00:03:20.090 --> 00:03:22.340
overall far wealthier and better

00:03:22.340 --> 00:03:25.160
supplied with the goods it needs it's a

00:03:25.160 --> 00:03:27.200
tribute to the world Smith foresaw that

00:03:27.200 --> 00:03:29.030
we have ended up with job titles like

00:03:29.030 --> 00:03:31.310
senior packaging and branding designer

00:03:31.310 --> 00:03:33.950
intake and triage clinician research

00:03:33.950 --> 00:03:36.500
center manager risk and internal audit

00:03:36.500 --> 00:03:38.360
controller and transport policy

00:03:38.360 --> 00:03:41.269
consultant in other words tiny cogs in a

00:03:41.269 --> 00:03:44.090
giant efficient machine hugely richer

00:03:44.090 --> 00:03:46.790
but full of private longings to give our

00:03:46.790 --> 00:03:50.060
multitudinous self-expression one of

00:03:50.060 --> 00:03:51.620
Adam Smith's most intelligent and

00:03:51.620 --> 00:03:53.630
penetrating readers with the German

00:03:53.630 --> 00:03:56.120
economist Karl Marx marks agreed

00:03:56.120 --> 00:03:57.709
entirely with Smith's analysis

00:03:57.709 --> 00:04:00.320
specialization had transformed the world

00:04:00.320 --> 00:04:02.840
and possessed the revolutionary power to

00:04:02.840 --> 00:04:05.540
enrich individuals and nations but where

00:04:05.540 --> 00:04:07.220
he differed from Smith was in his

00:04:07.220 --> 00:04:08.989
assessment of how desirable this

00:04:08.989 --> 00:04:11.180
development might be we would certainly

00:04:11.180 --> 00:04:12.769
make ourselves a wealthier by

00:04:12.769 --> 00:04:14.930
specializing but we would also if he

00:04:14.930 --> 00:04:17.209
pointed out with passion dull our lives

00:04:17.209 --> 00:04:20.479
and cauterize our talents in describing

00:04:20.479 --> 00:04:23.150
his utopian communist Society marks

00:04:23.150 --> 00:04:25.640
place enormous emphasis on the idea of

00:04:25.640 --> 00:04:28.490
everyone having many different jobs

00:04:28.490 --> 00:04:31.460
there were to be no specialists here in

00:04:31.460 --> 00:04:33.200
a pointed dig at Smith he wrote in

00:04:33.200 --> 00:04:35.990
communist society nobody has one

00:04:35.990 --> 00:04:37.040
exclusive

00:04:37.040 --> 00:04:38.900
of activity but each can become

00:04:38.900 --> 00:04:40.910
accomplished in any branch he wishes

00:04:40.910 --> 00:04:43.190
thus it's possible for me to do one

00:04:43.190 --> 00:04:45.650
thing today and another tomorrow to hunt

00:04:45.650 --> 00:04:47.720
in the morning to fish in the afternoon

00:04:47.720 --> 00:04:49.970
to rear cattle in the evening to

00:04:49.970 --> 00:04:52.070
criticize after dinner without ever

00:04:52.070 --> 00:04:54.650
becoming a hunter or fisherman a

00:04:54.650 --> 00:04:57.620
shepherd or a critic it's a beautiful

00:04:57.620 --> 00:05:01.250
but entirely unrealistic dream we have

00:05:01.250 --> 00:05:03.590
collectively chosen to make work pay

00:05:03.590 --> 00:05:06.320
more rather than be more interesting

00:05:06.320 --> 00:05:08.900
it's a somber thought but a consoling

00:05:08.900 --> 00:05:11.570
one to our suffering is painful but it

00:05:11.570 --> 00:05:13.910
has a curious dignity to it because it

00:05:13.910 --> 00:05:15.500
doesn't uniquely affect us as

00:05:15.500 --> 00:05:17.870
individuals it applies as much to the

00:05:17.870 --> 00:05:20.750
CEO as to the intern to the artist as

00:05:20.750 --> 00:05:23.390
much as to the accountant everyone could

00:05:23.390 --> 00:05:25.370
have found so many versions of happiness

00:05:25.370 --> 00:05:27.860
that will elude them in suffering in

00:05:27.860 --> 00:05:29.690
this way we are participating in the

00:05:29.690 --> 00:05:32.030
common human lot we can be sure that

00:05:32.030 --> 00:05:34.520
whatever we do parts of our potential

00:05:34.520 --> 00:05:36.860
will have to go undeveloped and die

00:05:36.860 --> 00:05:39.050
without ever having had the chance to

00:05:39.050 --> 00:05:41.360
come to full maturity for the sake of

00:05:41.360 --> 00:05:43.550
the real benefits of focus and

00:05:43.550 --> 00:05:46.900
specialization

00:05:52.680 --> 00:05:54.740
you
