00:00:00.790 --> 00:00:05.280
&gt;&gt; From the Library of
Congress in Washington DC.

00:00:06.510 --> 00:00:22.530
[silence]

00:00:22.530 --> 00:00:25.860
&gt;&gt; KAREN JAFFE: I'm Karen Jaffe,
head of the Young Readers Center

00:00:25.860 --> 00:00:28.420
at the Library of Congress.

00:00:28.420 --> 00:00:32.020
I'd like to welcome today
the School Without Walls,

00:00:32.020 --> 00:00:35.220
at Francis Stevens' seventh grade.

00:00:35.220 --> 00:00:38.970
If you're seventh graders,
raise your hand.

00:00:38.970 --> 00:00:42.750
Okay. Glad to see you.

00:00:44.360 --> 00:00:47.420
Thank you, Clay.

00:00:47.420 --> 00:00:53.090 position:56%
I'd like to also welcome our special
partner, Everybody Wins D.C.,

00:00:53.090 --> 00:01:00.170
and their very special supporter,
Target stores, who is making a copy

00:01:00.170 --> 00:01:03.940
of the book you're going to
hear about today, March Two,

00:01:03.940 --> 00:01:08.490
available to you, each and every
one of you, when you leave.

00:01:08.490 --> 00:01:13.820
Thank Target for that,
and Everybody Wins D.C..

00:01:13.820 --> 00:01:18.480 position:56%
We also, of course, want to
mention and thank our special guest,

00:01:18.480 --> 00:01:28.030
Congressman John Lewis, and Andrew
Aydin, his co-author of March Two.

00:01:28.030 --> 00:01:30.470
They both have very busy schedules

00:01:30.470 --> 00:01:33.850
at the U.S. House of
Representatives.

00:01:33.850 --> 00:01:38.880
Congressman Lewis represents
the fifth district of Georgia.

00:01:39.940 --> 00:01:44.130
Today is really an historic
day for all of us in this room,

00:01:44.130 --> 00:01:48.490
because you have had a chance
to see, and I think some of you

00:01:48.490 --> 00:01:54.460
for a second time, the Library
of Congress Civil Rights Exhibit.

00:01:55.530 --> 00:02:00.580
John Lewis is clearly one of
the most courageous persons

00:02:00.580 --> 00:02:07.500
of the Civil Rights Movement,
that this movement ever produced

00:02:07.500 --> 00:02:11.100
and we're very honored
to have him with us.

00:02:11.100 --> 00:02:14.340
So, I'm just going to give
you a brief, very short bio

00:02:14.340 --> 00:02:18.690
because you're really going to be
hearing from him about his life,

00:02:18.690 --> 00:02:22.400
but I'll just put a
few things in context.

00:02:22.400 --> 00:02:26.480
John Lewis grew up on his
family's farm in Alabama,

00:02:26.480 --> 00:02:29.660
attended segregated public schools.

00:02:29.660 --> 00:02:34.340
As a young boy, he was inspired
by the Montgomery Bus Boycott,

00:02:34.340 --> 00:02:38.260
and knew he wanted to be part
of the Civil Rights Movement.

00:02:38.260 --> 00:02:42.490
As a student first at Troy
University, and then when he went

00:02:42.490 --> 00:02:45.780
to Fisk University,
he organized sit-ins.

00:02:45.780 --> 00:02:49.380
He participated in the
Freedom Rides, and was chairman

00:02:49.380 --> 00:02:52.820
of the Student Non-violent
Coordinating Committee,

00:02:52.820 --> 00:02:56.000
called SNCC, which
he helped to form.

00:02:56.000 --> 00:03:00.760
He also graduated from the American
Baptist Theological Seminary.

00:03:00.760 --> 00:03:04.650
At 23, he was an architect
and keynote speaker

00:03:04.650 --> 00:03:15.050
at the historic March on
Washington in August of 1963.

00:03:15.050 --> 00:03:20.700
He and Hosea Williams led
the 600 peaceful protesters

00:03:20.700 --> 00:03:28.660
across the Edmund Pettus Bridge
in Selma, Alabama in March, 1965,

00:03:28.660 --> 00:03:31.140
but the marchers were
attacked by state troopers,

00:03:31.140 --> 00:03:36.880
and the infamous confrontation
became known as Bloody Sunday.

00:03:36.880 --> 00:03:41.390
In 1977, President Jimmy
Carter appointed him

00:03:41.390 --> 00:03:44.950
to direct the 250,000 members

00:03:44.950 --> 00:03:49.440
of the federal volunteer
agency called Action.

00:03:49.440 --> 00:03:53.950
In 1981, he was elected to
the Atlanta City Council,

00:03:53.950 --> 00:04:00.570
and in 1986 was elected to U.S.
Congress, where he still serves.

00:04:00.570 --> 00:04:05.450
Congressman Lewis has won too many
awards and honors to list them all,

00:04:05.450 --> 00:04:09.800 position:56%
but it would be worth noting that
President Barack Obama presented him

00:04:09.800 --> 00:04:11.510
with the Medal of Freedom,

00:04:11.510 --> 00:04:15.430
the highest civilian
honor in our country.

00:04:15.430 --> 00:04:26.970
Allow me to introduce Congressman
John Lewis and Andrew Aydin.

00:04:26.970 --> 00:04:28.270
[applause]

00:04:28.270 --> 00:04:29.570
&gt;&gt; JOHN LEWIS: Good morning.

00:04:29.570 --> 00:04:30.870
&gt;&gt; AUDIENCE: Good morning.

00:04:30.870 --> 00:04:32.170
&gt;&gt; JOHN LEWIS: You're
a beautiful group.

00:04:32.170 --> 00:04:33.470
You're handsome.

00:04:33.470 --> 00:04:34.770
You look good.

00:04:34.770 --> 00:04:36.070
&gt;&gt; AUDIENCE: Thank you.

00:04:36.070 --> 00:04:37.370
&gt;&gt; JOHN LEWIS: You look very good.

00:04:37.370 --> 00:04:38.670
&gt;&gt; AUDIENCE: Thanks.

00:04:38.670 --> 00:04:39.970
&gt;&gt; JOHN LEWIS: And I
know you're very smart.

00:04:39.970 --> 00:04:41.270
&gt;&gt; AUDIENCE: Thank you.

00:04:41.270 --> 00:04:42.740 position:56%
&gt;&gt; JOHN LEWIS: Now, I remember
many, many years ago, when I had all

00:04:42.740 --> 00:04:45.610
of my hair, and a few
pounds lighter,

00:04:45.610 --> 00:04:53.510
when I was in elementary school,
middle school, high school.

00:04:53.510 --> 00:04:56.200
But, long before then,
I remember growing

00:04:56.200 --> 00:05:00.350
up on a farm, in the rural Alabama.

00:05:00.350 --> 00:05:04.460
My father had been a
sharecropper, a tenant farmer,

00:05:04.460 --> 00:05:07.510
living on another person's land.

00:05:07.510 --> 00:05:10.230
But, in 1944, when I
was four years old,

00:05:10.230 --> 00:05:12.340
and I do remember when I was four.

00:05:12.340 --> 00:05:15.640
How many of you remember
when you were four?

00:05:15.640 --> 00:05:19.300
What happened to the rest of us?

00:05:19.300 --> 00:05:20.640
Do you remember?

00:05:20.640 --> 00:05:22.340
Do you remember?

00:05:22.340 --> 00:05:23.640
&gt;&gt; AUDIENCE: Yes.

00:05:23.640 --> 00:05:24.940
&gt;&gt; JOHN LEWIS: Okay, good.

00:05:24.940 --> 00:05:26.720
Well, my father had saved $300,

00:05:26.720 --> 00:05:31.750
and a man sold him 110
acres of land for $300.

00:05:31.750 --> 00:05:35.180
That's a lot of land for $300.

00:05:35.180 --> 00:05:40.410
And on this farm, we raised a
lot of cotton and corn, peanuts,

00:05:40.410 --> 00:05:42.580
horse, cows, and chickens.

00:05:42.580 --> 00:05:48.740
Andrew, this young man here,
I've been his Congressperson

00:05:48.740 --> 00:05:50.800
since he was three years old?

00:05:50.800 --> 00:05:52.240
Or four, Andrew?

00:05:52.240 --> 00:05:53.540
&gt;&gt; ANDREW AUDIN: Three.

00:05:53.540 --> 00:05:55.850
&gt;&gt; JOHN LEWIS: Three.

00:05:55.850 --> 00:05:59.110
He would tell you the story
that when I was a little boy,

00:05:59.110 --> 00:06:02.660
growing up on that farm,
it was my responsibility

00:06:02.660 --> 00:06:04.890
to care for the chickens.

00:06:04.890 --> 00:06:10.500
When you read March Book One
and Book Two, you know I fell

00:06:10.500 --> 00:06:11.800
in love raising chickens.

00:06:11.800 --> 00:06:13.790
Any of you know what they
say about raising chickens?

00:06:13.790 --> 00:06:15.830
Any of you?

00:06:15.830 --> 00:06:17.710
I know some of you like
to eat chicken, right?

00:06:17.710 --> 00:06:19.010
&gt;&gt; AUDIENCE: Yes.

00:06:19.010 --> 00:06:20.990
&gt;&gt; JOHN LEWIS: What,
do you like Popeye's?

00:06:20.990 --> 00:06:22.370
&gt;&gt; AUDIENCE: Yes.

00:06:22.370 --> 00:06:24.160
&gt;&gt; JOHN LEWIS: Or Kentucky Fried?

00:06:24.160 --> 00:06:25.460
&gt;&gt; AUDIENCE: Yes.

00:06:25.460 --> 00:06:26.760
&gt;&gt; JOHN LEWIS: Or [inaudible]?

00:06:26.760 --> 00:06:28.640
&gt;&gt; AUDIENCE: Yes.

00:06:28.640 --> 00:06:30.250
&gt;&gt; JOHN LEWIS: Okay,
and others, right?

00:06:30.250 --> 00:06:32.800
But you don't know anything
about raising chickens.

00:06:32.800 --> 00:06:37.040
Well, let me tell you what I had
to do as a young boy, growing up.

00:06:37.040 --> 00:06:40.600
When I was seven, eight,
nine years old,

00:06:40.600 --> 00:06:42.890
I fell in love with
raising chickens.

00:06:42.890 --> 00:06:45.060
When a setting hen was sat,
I had to take the fresh eggs,

00:06:45.060 --> 00:06:50.200
mark them with a pencil, place
them under the setting hen and wait

00:06:50.200 --> 00:06:53.190
for the three long weeks for
the little chicks to hatch.

00:06:53.190 --> 00:06:55.870
&gt;&gt; I know some of you are
saying now, "John Lewis,

00:06:55.870 --> 00:06:57.180
why did you mark the fresh egg

00:06:57.180 --> 00:07:02.760
with a pencil before you place
them under the setting hen?"

00:07:02.760 --> 00:07:05.350
Well, from time to time, another
hen would get on that same nest,

00:07:05.350 --> 00:07:11.360
and there would be more fresh eggs,
so you had to tell the fresh eggs

00:07:11.360 --> 00:07:13.540
from the eggs that were
already under the setting hen.

00:07:13.540 --> 00:07:14.840
You follow me?

00:07:14.840 --> 00:07:16.140
Do you really follow me?

00:07:16.140 --> 00:07:17.440
&gt;&gt; AUDIENCE: Yeah.

00:07:17.440 --> 00:07:18.740
&gt;&gt; JOHN LEWIS: It's okay if you
don't follow me, it's all right.

00:07:18.740 --> 00:07:20.460
When these little chicks
were hatched,

00:07:20.460 --> 00:07:22.400
I would fool these setting hens.

00:07:22.400 --> 00:07:24.750 position:56%
I would cheat on these setting hens.

00:07:24.750 --> 00:07:27.800
When I look back on it, it
was not the right thing to do.

00:07:27.800 --> 00:07:30.150
It was not the good thing to do.

00:07:30.150 --> 00:07:32.740
I kept on cheating on
those setting hens.

00:07:32.740 --> 00:07:37.970 position:56%
I would take these little chicks and
put them in a box with a lantern,

00:07:37.970 --> 00:07:40.360
raise them on their own,
get some more fresh eggs,

00:07:40.360 --> 00:07:43.810
mark them with a pencil, place
them under the setting hen.

00:07:43.810 --> 00:07:46.770 position:56%
I kept doing it over and over again.

00:07:46.770 --> 00:07:50.670
As a little boy, about
eight or nine years old,

00:07:50.670 --> 00:07:52.500
I wanted to be a minister.

00:07:52.500 --> 00:07:53.950
I got all of our chickens
together in the chicken yard,

00:07:53.950 --> 00:07:55.720
and together here, in
this beautiful room.

00:07:55.720 --> 00:07:57.020
&gt;&gt; And my brothers and sisters

00:07:57.020 --> 00:08:01.480
and first cousins were lining
outside around the chicken yard.

00:08:01.480 --> 00:08:04.080
Then, I would start
speaking, or preaching.

00:08:04.080 --> 00:08:05.380
When I look back on it,

00:08:05.380 --> 00:08:06.680
some of these chickens
would bow their heads.

00:08:06.680 --> 00:08:10.110
Some of these chickens
would shake their heads.

00:08:10.110 --> 00:08:13.900
They never quite sit there now.

00:08:13.900 --> 00:08:18.180
These chickens tended listen
to me much better than some

00:08:18.180 --> 00:08:19.480
of my colleagues and
friends listen to me today.

00:08:19.480 --> 00:08:21.130
Some of the little chickens were
just a little more productive.

00:08:21.130 --> 00:08:22.430
&gt;&gt; At least they produced
[inaudible].

00:08:22.430 --> 00:08:24.820
I had grown up there.

00:08:24.820 --> 00:08:27.590
We would visit the
little town of Troy,

00:08:27.590 --> 00:08:30.620
visit Montgomery, about
50 miles away.

00:08:30.620 --> 00:08:32.400
Troy about ten miles away.

00:08:32.400 --> 00:08:36.260 position:56%
Visit Tuskegee, about 40 miles away.

00:08:36.260 --> 00:08:40.600
I saw those signs that said, "white
men", "colored men", "white women",

00:08:40.600 --> 00:08:43.640
"colored women", "white
waiting", "colored waiting".

00:08:43.640 --> 00:08:45.740
They would go downtown
on a Saturday afternoon

00:08:45.740 --> 00:08:47.470
to the theater, to see a movie.

00:08:47.470 --> 00:08:52.180
All of us little black children
had to go upstairs to the balcony.

00:08:52.180 --> 00:08:58.250
All of the little white children
were downstairs on the first floor.

00:08:58.250 --> 00:09:01.680
I kept on saying to my mother,
my father, my grandparents,

00:09:01.680 --> 00:09:03.400
my great-grandparents, "Why?

00:09:03.400 --> 00:09:05.610
Why?" They said, "That's
the way it is.

00:09:05.610 --> 00:09:07.280
Don't get in the way.

00:09:07.280 --> 00:09:10.950
Don't get in trouble."

00:09:10.950 --> 00:09:22.100 position:56%
&gt;&gt; But, 60 years ago today, December
1st, 1955, I heard about Rosa Parks.

00:09:22.100 --> 00:09:26.670
For the action of Rosa Parks, and
the words of Martin Luther King,

00:09:26.670 --> 00:09:31.690
Jr. inspired me to find
a way to get in the way.

00:09:31.690 --> 00:09:35.060
Remember, my folks told
me, "Don't get in the way.

00:09:35.060 --> 00:09:37.100
Don't get in trouble."

00:09:37.100 --> 00:09:39.060
But, I got in trouble.

00:09:39.060 --> 00:09:41.750
I got in what I called
"good trouble".

00:09:41.750 --> 00:09:45.240
I didn't like seeing those signs
that said "white" and "colored".

00:09:45.240 --> 00:09:48.900
White boys, colored boys, white
girls, colored girls, white men,

00:09:48.900 --> 00:09:51.560
colored men, white
women, colored women.

00:09:51.560 --> 00:09:53.820
I wanted to do something about it.

00:09:53.820 --> 00:09:57.950 position:56%
&gt;&gt; So, in 1956, when I was 16 years
old, some of my brothers and sisters

00:09:57.950 --> 00:09:59.470
and cousins, we went down
to the public library,

00:09:59.470 --> 00:10:01.060
trying to get a library card,
trying to check out some books.

00:10:01.060 --> 00:10:02.440
We were told by the
librarian that the library was

00:10:02.440 --> 00:10:03.740
for whites only, and
not for coloreds.

00:10:03.740 --> 00:10:05.050
I never went back to the library
in the little town of Troy

00:10:05.050 --> 00:10:07.150
until July 5th, 1998, for a
book signing for my first book.

00:10:07.150 --> 00:10:08.530
And hundreds of blacks and
white citizens showed up.

00:10:08.530 --> 00:10:10.540
At the end of the program,
they gave me a library card.

00:10:10.540 --> 00:10:26.020
&gt;&gt; So, in 1958, before 1958, 7, at
the age of 17, I met Rosa Parks.

00:10:26.020 --> 00:10:28.520
Changed my life.

00:10:28.520 --> 00:10:41.960
The next year, 1958, at the age of
18, I met Martin Luther King, Jr..

00:10:41.960 --> 00:10:51.150
Andrew would tell you, and March
would tell you, these two books,

00:10:51.150 --> 00:10:58.910 position:56%
that Rosa Parks, Dr. King and others
inspired me to find a way to get

00:10:58.910 --> 00:11:01.690
in the way, so I got in the way.

00:11:01.690 --> 00:11:07.060
Just think, a few short years ago,
black people and white people,

00:11:07.060 --> 00:11:12.870
young black students, young
white students, black teachers,

00:11:12.870 --> 00:11:17.880
white teachers, black lawyers,
white lawyers, they would be seated

00:11:17.880 --> 00:11:25.070
on a bus, a Greyhound bus, leaving
Washington D.C. in May of 1961,

00:11:25.070 --> 00:11:28.240
the same year that President
Barack Obama was born.

00:11:28.240 --> 00:11:30.280
&gt;&gt; We had to change that.

00:11:30.280 --> 00:11:33.620
We were beaten, we were
arrested, we went to jail.

00:11:33.620 --> 00:11:35.810
I got arrested a few times.

00:11:35.810 --> 00:11:38.420
Beaten, and left bloody.

00:11:38.420 --> 00:11:43.160
But Dr. King, Rosa Parks, and
others told us the way of peace,

00:11:43.160 --> 00:11:46.760
the way of love, the
way of non-violence.

00:11:46.760 --> 00:11:55.430
Andrew would tell you that
I had wonderful teachers

00:11:55.430 --> 00:11:57.980
in this poorly staffed,
segregated school.

00:11:57.980 --> 00:12:00.700 position:56%
And I had a teacher who told me over

00:12:00.700 --> 00:12:02.110
and over again, "Read,
my child, read."

00:12:02.110 --> 00:12:04.780
I tried to read everything.

00:12:04.780 --> 00:12:09.670 position:56%
We were too poor to have a
subscription to the local newspaper.

00:12:09.670 --> 00:12:10.970
We couldn't afford it.

00:12:10.970 --> 00:12:13.650 position:56%
My grandfather had one, and each day

00:12:13.650 --> 00:12:15.400
when he would finish
reading his newspaper,

00:12:15.400 --> 00:12:17.450
he would pass it on to us.

00:12:17.450 --> 00:12:18.920
So, I read about Rosa Parks.

00:12:18.920 --> 00:12:20.220
I read about Martin Luther King Jr.

00:12:20.220 --> 00:12:24.570
&gt;&gt; And so the actions of Rosa
Parks, the words, the leadership

00:12:24.570 --> 00:12:28.830
of Dr. King inspired me and
changed my life forever.

00:12:28.830 --> 00:12:31.850
If it hadn't been for Rosa
Parks, Martin Luther King Jr.,

00:12:31.850 --> 00:12:34.760
and the Civil Rights
Movement of the sixties,

00:12:34.760 --> 00:12:41.850 position:56%
I wouldn't be sitting here today and
talking with you, speaking with you.

00:12:41.850 --> 00:12:44.570
So, America has come a distance.

00:12:44.570 --> 00:12:47.660
We made a lot of progress, but
we still have a distance to go.

00:12:47.660 --> 00:12:59.330 position:56%
I say to each and every one of you,
continue to read, and never give up.

00:12:59.330 --> 00:13:00.630
Never become bitter.

00:13:00.630 --> 00:13:02.290
Never hate.

00:13:02.290 --> 00:13:07.550
Hate is too heavy a burden to bear.

00:13:07.550 --> 00:13:19.650
We were beaten, left bloody, left
unconscious, but I'm not bitter.

00:13:19.650 --> 00:13:20.950
We'll never hate.

00:13:20.950 --> 00:13:22.250
The will to love is another way.

00:13:22.250 --> 00:13:23.550
Andrew? [applause]

00:13:23.550 --> 00:13:24.850
&gt;&gt; ANDREW AYDIN: It's
never easy to follow that.

00:13:24.850 --> 00:13:27.720
My name is Andrew Aydin,
Congressman's congressional office,

00:13:27.720 --> 00:13:29.730
and I'm the co-author of March.

00:13:29.730 --> 00:13:33.320
When I was a kid, I
was a huge comic geek.

00:13:33.320 --> 00:13:34.940
I was a nerd.

00:13:34.940 --> 00:13:37.130
I liked computers.

00:13:37.130 --> 00:13:39.730
Truth be told, my father
left when I was about three,

00:13:39.730 --> 00:13:41.710 position:56%
and I was raised by a single mother.

00:13:41.710 --> 00:13:45.450
And I started reading comics
because it was a refuge.

00:13:45.450 --> 00:13:48.510
It was a place where I could
see stories about justice,

00:13:48.510 --> 00:13:53.350 position:56%
and people doing the right thing,
people motivated by pure intentions,

00:13:53.350 --> 00:13:56.980
which, even at that age,
I felt was all too lacking

00:13:56.980 --> 00:13:59.030
in our society, right?

00:13:59.030 --> 00:14:00.840
How many of you guys read comics?

00:14:00.840 --> 00:14:03.920
That's a pretty good number.

00:14:03.920 --> 00:14:06.490
You guys ever go to
comic conventions?

00:14:06.490 --> 00:14:07.790
You ever been?

00:14:07.790 --> 00:14:09.090
&gt;&gt; AUDIENCE: ComicCon?

00:14:09.090 --> 00:14:10.390
&gt;&gt; ANDREW AYDIN: Yeah, right?

00:14:10.390 --> 00:14:14.540
You know John Lewis
marched at ComicCon?

00:14:14.540 --> 00:14:17.190
He cosplayed as himself.

00:14:17.190 --> 00:14:21.690
Yeah, he had on his backpack
from Selma, and the trench coat,

00:14:21.690 --> 00:14:25.450
and he led a march of
kids through the ComicCon.

00:14:25.450 --> 00:14:30.510
It was a really moving moment,
coming at the end of this journey,

00:14:30.510 --> 00:14:35.150
because- To put it in another
way, when I was your age,

00:14:35.150 --> 00:14:37.520
if I pulled a comic book
out in my classroom,

00:14:37.520 --> 00:14:40.840
my teachers would take it away,
because at that point in time,

00:14:40.840 --> 00:14:42.910
comics were not seen as literature.

00:14:42.910 --> 00:14:45.680
They were not seen as
something that was acceptable.

00:14:45.680 --> 00:14:48.360
But, not too long ago,
Congressman Lewis came with me back

00:14:48.360 --> 00:14:50.250
to my own high school, to talk

00:14:50.250 --> 00:14:53.660
about their experiences
teaching our graphic novels.

00:14:53.660 --> 00:14:57.480
I say that as an example
of, change is possible

00:14:57.480 --> 00:15:01.240
in a brief period of time.

00:15:01.240 --> 00:15:02.790
So, I guess you're probably asking,

00:15:02.790 --> 00:15:05.730
at some point why John Lewis
would write a graphic novel?

00:15:05.730 --> 00:15:07.770
Well, it started in 2008.

00:15:07.770 --> 00:15:10.730
I was serving on the
Congressman's re-election campaign.

00:15:10.730 --> 00:15:14.720
And I admitted, as we were talking
about what we were going to do

00:15:14.720 --> 00:15:17.020
after the campaign was
over, that I was going to go

00:15:17.020 --> 00:15:19.680
to a comic convention, and
everybody laughed at me,

00:15:19.680 --> 00:15:21.530
except for one person: John Lewis.

00:15:21.530 --> 00:15:22.830
He didn't laugh.

00:15:22.830 --> 00:15:25.200
He said there was a comic book
during the Civil Rights Movement,

00:15:25.200 --> 00:15:27.540
and it was incredibly influential.

00:15:27.540 --> 00:15:29.710
It was called "Martin Luther
King and the Montgomery Story,"

00:15:29.710 --> 00:15:32.070
and it was used to inspire some

00:15:32.070 --> 00:15:34.520
of the earliest acts
of civil disobedience.

00:15:34.520 --> 00:15:38.830
In fact, we later found out, it
was actually edited by Dr. King.

00:15:38.830 --> 00:15:41.780 position:56%
Doesn't that change your perspective
of Dr. King a little bit?

00:15:41.780 --> 00:15:43.760
Dr. King, comic book editor?

00:15:43.760 --> 00:15:46.770
But it's true, and his edits

00:15:46.770 --> 00:15:49.930
that he submitted actually
made it into the final version.

00:15:49.930 --> 00:15:52.780
And so, me being me and
loving comics like I do,

00:15:52.780 --> 00:15:56.100
I was captivated by this idea.

00:15:56.100 --> 00:15:57.400
I was young.

00:15:57.400 --> 00:15:58.700
I was 24. I didn't know any better.

00:15:58.700 --> 00:16:01.500
I started asking, "John Lewis,
why don't you write a comic book?"

00:16:01.500 --> 00:16:03.650
At first he said, "Oh, maybe."

00:16:03.650 --> 00:16:06.230
Which, if you ever get a chance
to go into politics or volunteer

00:16:06.230 --> 00:16:07.530
or anything, you'll find

00:16:07.530 --> 00:16:09.510
that 'maybe' is a really
nice way of saying 'no'.

00:16:09.510 --> 00:16:12.540
I couldn't give up on the idea.

00:16:12.540 --> 00:16:15.430
I really believed in it.

00:16:15.430 --> 00:16:17.500
Finally, after I asked
several more times,

00:16:17.500 --> 00:16:18.800
the Congressman said,
"You know what?

00:16:18.800 --> 00:16:21.260
Let's do it, but only if
you write it with me."

00:16:21.260 --> 00:16:22.990
That moment changed my life.

00:16:22.990 --> 00:16:24.320
But, if there's a lesson
for you guys,

00:16:24.320 --> 00:16:26.610
it's that if people
are laughing at you,

00:16:26.610 --> 00:16:29.280
you're probably doing
something right.

00:16:29.280 --> 00:16:31.180 position:56%
Remember that then people tease you,

00:16:31.180 --> 00:16:33.170
or they think your
idea is a little nutty.

00:16:33.170 --> 00:16:37.850
It just means you're a little
bit ahead of your time.

00:16:37.850 --> 00:16:42.820
Now, for this journey,
working with Congressman Lewis,

00:16:42.820 --> 00:16:44.420
it's been pretty incredible.

00:16:44.420 --> 00:16:47.690
He's been my Congressman
since I was three years old.

00:16:47.690 --> 00:16:51.220 position:56%
It's not the sort of thing that your
single mom envisions you will grow

00:16:51.220 --> 00:16:52.520
up to do.

00:16:52.520 --> 00:16:56.290
It's not something many people
would have even thought possible,

00:16:56.290 --> 00:16:57.590
coming from where I came from.

00:16:57.590 --> 00:16:59.160
My father was a Turkish immigrant.

00:16:59.160 --> 00:17:02.980
He was a Muslim, which is kind
of a dirty word these days.

00:17:02.980 --> 00:17:10.860
But, I never really knew him, and
my mother took unbelievable action

00:17:10.860 --> 00:17:13.030
to make sure that I
had a good education,

00:17:13.030 --> 00:17:15.290
to make sure that every time I came
home, there was somebody there,

00:17:15.290 --> 00:17:19.250
and to make sure that
when I wanted to learn,

00:17:19.250 --> 00:17:21.610
I could always go to the library.

00:17:21.610 --> 00:17:23.910
That's why it's so
important to me to be here.

00:17:23.910 --> 00:17:28.470
The Library of Congress is this
incredible institution that those

00:17:28.470 --> 00:17:30.720
of us who live in Washington are
fortunate to be able to visit.

00:17:30.720 --> 00:17:35.490
This is a place with so much
history, so much invested

00:17:35.490 --> 00:17:37.670
in every stone that makes it up.

00:17:37.670 --> 00:17:41.420
To be in the building, every
time, I always get excited.

00:17:41.420 --> 00:17:45.660
So, I'm glad you guys are here.

00:17:45.660 --> 00:17:49.520
I'll tell you, there's been some
weird moments on this journey.

00:17:49.520 --> 00:17:54.310
Early on, when we were starting
out, and we didn't have a book,

00:17:54.310 --> 00:17:56.270
we just had an idea, and I
was working on it at night,

00:17:56.270 --> 00:17:57.700
because we have a day job, right?

00:17:57.700 --> 00:17:59.150
It's not easy.

00:17:59.150 --> 00:18:02.910 position:56%
I'm going to go on a pilgrimage with
a Congressman where he leads members

00:18:02.910 --> 00:18:04.800
of Congress down to Alabama.

00:18:04.800 --> 00:18:07.340
He shows them the sites,
he tells them the stories.

00:18:07.340 --> 00:18:10.430
I get on the elevator and
there's John Siegenthaler,

00:18:10.430 --> 00:18:13.500
which was Robert Kennedy's
aide, and there's Ethel Kennedy,

00:18:13.500 --> 00:18:15.270
who was Robert Kennedy's widow.

00:18:15.270 --> 00:18:16.570
I couldn't help myself.

00:18:16.570 --> 00:18:20.360
I was like, "Excuse me, I just
thought you might want to know.

00:18:20.360 --> 00:18:24.700
You all are in a comic book that
I'm working on with John Lewis."

00:18:24.700 --> 00:18:27.330
Ethel Kennedy looked up at me
with these big, beautiful eyes,

00:18:27.330 --> 00:18:30.550
and she was like, "That's
nice, dear."

00:18:30.550 --> 00:18:34.680
You can understand what it meant
to me then when a few years later,

00:18:34.680 --> 00:18:36.920
she called me on my
cell phone to tell me

00:18:36.920 --> 00:18:39.340
that March Book One was the
first graphic novel ever

00:18:39.340 --> 00:18:42.180
to receive the Robert
F. Kennedy Book Award.

00:18:43.850 --> 00:18:47.910
Above all that, the most important
thing is John Lewis' story.

00:18:47.910 --> 00:18:52.910
He grew up poor, and he
never let that stop him.

00:18:52.910 --> 00:18:55.030
He was a little maladjusted.

00:18:55.030 --> 00:18:56.790
He was a little weird.

00:18:56.790 --> 00:18:58.150
It's okay.

00:18:58.150 --> 00:19:02.250
We all are, and if anything, we
all need to explore those parts

00:19:02.250 --> 00:19:05.350
of ourselves, because that's what
makes us unique, and in the end,

00:19:05.350 --> 00:19:06.690
that's what makes us successful.

00:19:06.690 --> 00:19:09.910
I want to point to
a scene in Book Two,

00:19:09.910 --> 00:19:11.210
when you get a chance to read it.

00:19:11.210 --> 00:19:13.430
It's during the Children's Crusade.

00:19:13.430 --> 00:19:17.340
Many of those kids who
participated were your age.

00:19:17.340 --> 00:19:20.490
If I'm totally frank, the
status quo, the powers that be,

00:19:20.490 --> 00:19:23.550
they're more afraid of
you than you are of them.

00:19:23.550 --> 00:19:25.090
You're free.

00:19:25.090 --> 00:19:29.400
You have the power to change this
country, to change our society.

00:19:29.400 --> 00:19:32.510
It's just a matter of learning the
tools, and having the perseverance

00:19:32.510 --> 00:19:35.180
and the commitment
to make it possible.

00:19:35.180 --> 00:19:36.480
So, I thank you guys for listening.

00:19:36.480 --> 00:19:38.580
It's an honor to be here.

00:19:38.580 --> 00:19:40.340
Keep reading comics.

00:19:40.340 --> 00:19:42.240
It's great to have
this in the classroom.

00:19:42.240 --> 00:19:50.970
[applause]

00:19:50.970 --> 00:19:58.660
&gt;&gt; KAREN JAFFE: If you don't mind,
we'd like to give some questions.

00:19:58.660 --> 00:19:59.960
&gt;&gt; JOHN LEWIS: Yes.

00:19:59.960 --> 00:20:01.260
&gt;&gt; AUDIENCE: My name
is Juneau Hackett.

00:20:01.260 --> 00:20:02.560
I'm in the seventh grade.

00:20:02.560 --> 00:20:07.610
My question for you was, when
you did the march the first time,

00:20:07.610 --> 00:20:14.220
how hard was it when the officers,

00:20:14.220 --> 00:20:16.340
when they chased you
back the other way,

00:20:16.340 --> 00:20:21.160
they made you get out of the way?

00:20:21.160 --> 00:20:27.910
&gt;&gt; JOHN LEWIS: Well, on that day,
March 7, 1965, I'm 25 years old.

00:20:27.910 --> 00:20:31.210
Again, I had all my hair,
a few pounds lighter,

00:20:31.210 --> 00:20:35.030
and I was wearing a backpack
before it became fashionable

00:20:35.030 --> 00:20:36.800
to wear backpacks.

00:20:36.800 --> 00:20:39.430
In this backpack, I had two books.

00:20:39.430 --> 00:20:42.950
I thought we were going to be
arrested, going to go to jail.

00:20:42.950 --> 00:20:46.200
So, I wanted to have
something to read.

00:20:46.200 --> 00:20:48.150
I had one apple, and one orange.

00:20:48.150 --> 00:20:50.470
I wanted to have something to eat.

00:20:50.470 --> 00:20:54.460
Since I thought we were going
to be in jail with my friends,

00:20:54.460 --> 00:20:58.160
neighbors, with my colleagues.

00:20:58.160 --> 00:21:02.400
I had toothpaste and a toothbrush.

00:21:02.400 --> 00:21:06.350
I wanted to be able
to brush my teeth.

00:21:06.350 --> 00:21:09.050
We were walking in twos.

00:21:09.050 --> 00:21:15.920
No one said a word, walking
beside a young man by the name

00:21:15.920 --> 00:21:21.330
of Josea Williams, one
of Dr. King's staff.

00:21:21.330 --> 00:21:28.110
We get to the highest
point on the bridge.

00:21:28.110 --> 00:21:37.960
We saw the sea of blue,
of Alabama state troopers.

00:21:37.960 --> 00:21:40.160
We continue to walk.

00:21:40.160 --> 00:21:48.190
We come within hearing
distance of the state troopers.

00:21:48.190 --> 00:21:51.040
I really thought we were
being arrested, and jailed.

00:21:51.040 --> 00:21:54.370
A man identified himself and
said, "I'm Major John Plough

00:21:54.370 --> 00:21:57.470
of the Alabama state troopers.

00:21:57.470 --> 00:22:11.590
This is an unlawful march, and
will not be allowed to continue.

00:22:11.590 --> 00:22:14.570
I give you three minutes
to disperse.

00:22:14.570 --> 00:22:21.720
Return to your homes
or to your church."

00:22:21.720 --> 00:22:29.970 position:56%
And Josea Williams said, "Major,
give us a moment to kneel and pray."

00:22:29.970 --> 00:22:32.650 position:56%
The Major said, "Troopers, advance."

00:22:32.650 --> 00:22:40.400
We saw his men putting
on their gas masks.

00:22:40.400 --> 00:22:43.290
They came toward us,
beating us with night sticks.

00:22:43.290 --> 00:22:45.880
Trampling us with horses.

00:22:45.880 --> 00:22:47.180
Releasing the tear gas.

00:22:47.180 --> 00:22:49.520
I was hit in the head.

00:22:49.520 --> 00:22:50.820
I thought I saw death.

00:22:50.820 --> 00:22:52.120
I thought I was going to die.

00:22:52.120 --> 00:22:53.720
50 years later, I don't know how
I made it back across that bridge,

00:22:53.720 --> 00:22:55.460 position:56%
through the streets of Selma, come
back to the church we had left from.

00:22:55.460 --> 00:22:56.760
The parent of someone
just took me back.

00:22:56.760 --> 00:22:58.430
We knew we had to continue, so when
Dr. King and others came and said,

00:22:58.430 --> 00:22:59.730
"We're going to march again.

00:22:59.730 --> 00:23:01.030
We've got a court order."

00:23:01.030 --> 00:23:02.330
President Lyndon Johnson called
out the military to protect us.

00:23:02.330 --> 00:23:03.630
We finally made it, two
and a half weeks later,

00:23:03.630 --> 00:23:04.930
from Selma to Montgomery.

00:23:04.930 --> 00:23:06.230
Hundreds and thousands of
people, from all across America,

00:23:06.230 --> 00:23:07.530
more than 25,000 people
came and marched with us.

00:23:07.530 --> 00:23:08.830
Black and white, Asian Americans,
Native American, Latinos.

00:23:08.830 --> 00:23:10.130
[applause]

00:23:10.130 --> 00:23:11.430
&gt;&gt; AUDIENCE: I'm [inaudible],
and if you were getting beaten,

00:23:11.430 --> 00:23:14.100
did you regret it, or did
you feel like, "Oh my God,

00:23:14.100 --> 00:23:16.170
I'm making history or [inaudible]?

00:23:16.170 --> 00:23:23.270
JOHN LEWIS: No, when I was
being beaten, I didn't ...

00:23:23.270 --> 00:23:26.210
No one likes pain.

00:23:26.210 --> 00:23:30.090
No one wanted to be
suffering, being beaten.

00:23:30.090 --> 00:23:37.040 position:56%
But, I felt it was part of the price
that I had to pay to change things.

00:23:38.210 --> 00:23:43.310
Years later and years before, I
was beaten on the Freedom Rides,

00:23:43.310 --> 00:23:47.920
in Rock Hill, South Carolina
as we left Washington, D.C..

00:23:47.920 --> 00:23:51.010
My seatmate was a young
white gentleman.

00:23:51.010 --> 00:23:53.430
When we arrived at the
Greyhound bus station,

00:23:53.430 --> 00:24:00.710
there was an attempt to beat us.

00:24:00.710 --> 00:24:03.000
They beat us, and left us bloody.

00:24:03.000 --> 00:24:04.300
Left us unconscious.

00:24:04.300 --> 00:24:06.690
Left us lying in a pool of blood.

00:24:06.690 --> 00:24:11.040
Many years later, one of the guys
that beat me and beat my seatmate,

00:24:11.040 --> 00:24:14.890
came to my office in the Canon
building right across the street.

00:24:14.890 --> 00:24:19.670
Came to my office, he was in his
seventies, with his son in his 40's

00:24:19.670 --> 00:24:22.710
and he said, "Mr. Lewis,
I'm one of the people

00:24:22.710 --> 00:24:26.640
that beat you and your seatmate."

00:24:26.640 --> 00:24:31.550
He said, "Will you forgive me?

00:24:31.550 --> 00:24:33.780
I want to apologize."

00:24:33.780 --> 00:24:37.320
The son started crying.

00:24:37.320 --> 00:24:38.620
He started crying.

00:24:38.620 --> 00:24:39.920
I said, "I accept your apology.

00:24:39.920 --> 00:24:41.220
I forgive you."

00:24:41.220 --> 00:24:42.520
He hugged me.

00:24:42.520 --> 00:24:43.820
I hugged him back,
and I started crying.

00:24:43.820 --> 00:24:45.590
That is the power of
the way of peace,

00:24:45.590 --> 00:24:49.520
the way of love, the
way of non-violence.

00:24:49.520 --> 00:24:54.270
Those signs that I saw
in 1961, they are gone.

00:24:54.270 --> 00:24:55.570
They will not return.

00:24:55.570 --> 00:24:59.760
The only places we would see those
signs today would be in a book.

00:24:59.760 --> 00:25:06.990
In a book, in a museum, on a video.

00:25:06.990 --> 00:25:18.760
When people tell me nothing has
changed, I feel like saying,

00:25:18.760 --> 00:25:20.060
"Come and walk in my shoes.

00:25:20.060 --> 00:25:21.360
I'll show you the changes."

00:25:21.360 --> 00:25:22.660
[applause]

00:25:22.660 --> 00:25:25.090
&gt;&gt; AUDIENCE: I'm [inaudible],
I'm in the seventh grade.

00:25:25.090 --> 00:25:27.770
My question is, after you
got arrested multiple times,

00:25:27.770 --> 00:25:30.530
what inspired you to
keep protesting?

00:25:32.290 --> 00:25:34.460
&gt;&gt; JOHN LEWIS: Andrew, you
may want to tell that story

00:25:34.460 --> 00:25:37.860
about me getting arrested and
how many times [inaudible].

00:25:37.860 --> 00:25:39.160
&gt;&gt; ANDREW AYDIN: Well,

00:25:39.160 --> 00:25:42.020 position:56%
I think sometimes the historic
record gets muddled as things go on.

00:25:42.020 --> 00:25:43.530
One of the things that's
fun about March is

00:25:43.530 --> 00:25:45.320
that we get to set things straight.

00:25:45.320 --> 00:25:49.300
One of the things we uncovered
that I think took all of us back,

00:25:49.300 --> 00:25:52.620
was the realization that during the
first week of the Selma campaign,

00:25:52.620 --> 00:25:56.210
John Lewis got arrested
four times in eight days.

00:25:56.210 --> 00:26:01.600
You've got to work to be arrested
four times in eight days, to get in

00:26:01.600 --> 00:26:03.180
and then get out of jail.

00:26:03.180 --> 00:26:05.260
There was some gifted
attorneys who were making sure

00:26:05.260 --> 00:26:07.650
that he was able to get out.

00:26:07.650 --> 00:26:16.110 position:56%
No human being, during the movement,
got in the way with such fervor.

00:26:16.110 --> 00:26:17.610
I'll let you finish the rest of it,

00:26:17.610 --> 00:26:21.400
but to me that's why his
story is so important.

00:26:21.400 --> 00:26:23.710
For us, it's easy to
say, "Okay, I tried it.

00:26:23.710 --> 00:26:25.010
I did it once.

00:26:25.010 --> 00:26:26.310
I did it twice.

00:26:26.310 --> 00:26:27.800
I did something."

00:26:27.800 --> 00:26:30.210
But to stay that committed,
to fight that hard,

00:26:30.210 --> 00:26:32.680
that's something we
all should aspire to.

00:26:32.680 --> 00:26:38.990
&gt;&gt; JOHN LEWIS: More than anything
else, I think, I saw something

00:26:38.990 --> 00:26:42.560
that I felt in me that
was not right, not fair.

00:26:42.560 --> 00:26:49.450
I'm not going to give up.

00:26:49.450 --> 00:26:54.020
As long as I could read, I was
going to stand up, speak up

00:26:54.020 --> 00:26:56.560
and speak out, and
try to do something.

00:26:56.560 --> 00:27:02.420
You get arrested, you go to
jail, and you get beaten.

00:27:02.420 --> 00:27:08.100
Some nurse or doctor or group
of people- no one helped us.

00:27:08.100 --> 00:27:14.350
When we beaten in Selma,
there was a group

00:27:14.350 --> 00:27:24.950
of nuns [inaudible]
that took care of us.

00:27:24.950 --> 00:27:26.590
[applause]

00:27:26.590 --> 00:27:27.890
&gt;&gt; AUDIENCE: My name is William.

00:27:27.890 --> 00:27:30.500
I'm in the sixth grade,
and my question to you is,

00:27:30.500 --> 00:27:34.420
what was one of the things
that you had to do ...

00:27:34.420 --> 00:27:37.340
What was your role in being
one of the main leaders

00:27:37.340 --> 00:27:39.240
in the Civil Rights Movement?

00:27:39.240 --> 00:27:44.020
&gt;&gt; JOHN LEWIS: Part of
my responsibility was

00:27:44.020 --> 00:27:47.470
to tell the story, just
go out and tell the story.

00:27:47.470 --> 00:27:49.310
What was happening,
how it was happening,

00:27:49.310 --> 00:27:51.570
and try to inspire people.

00:27:51.570 --> 00:27:56.570
We had to conduct what we
called "non-violent workshops".

00:27:56.570 --> 00:28:04.890 position:56%
You teach people not to strike back,
to believe in the way of peace,

00:28:04.890 --> 00:28:07.310
in the way of love, non-violence.

00:28:07.310 --> 00:28:11.020
Andrew will tell you, we had
what we called "road plan."

00:28:11.020 --> 00:28:13.840
You may call it "social drama".

00:28:13.840 --> 00:28:19.840
How to protect your body
if you're knocked down.

00:28:19.840 --> 00:28:25.170
We'd go to a sit-in.

00:28:25.170 --> 00:28:28.010
We had the dos and don'ts
of the sit-in one time.

00:28:28.010 --> 00:28:29.310
I was a student in [inaudible].

00:28:29.310 --> 00:28:35.380
We'd tell them to look
straight ahead.

00:28:35.380 --> 00:28:37.680
Sit up straight.

00:28:39.560 --> 00:28:41.860
Obey your leader.

00:28:43.050 --> 00:28:56.970
Follow in the teaching of Gandhi,
and Martin Luther King, Jr..

00:28:56.970 --> 00:28:58.270
[applause]

00:28:58.270 --> 00:29:00.540
&gt;&gt; AUDIENCE: My name is Max,
and I'm a seventh grader.

00:29:00.540 --> 00:29:05.610
I would like to know if there
was anyone besides Dr. King

00:29:05.610 --> 00:29:10.400
and Rosa Parks who inspired
you when you were younger?

00:29:12.390 --> 00:29:13.890
&gt;&gt; JOHN LEWIS: That's a
very good question, Max.

00:29:13.890 --> 00:29:15.470
Thank you very much.

00:29:15.470 --> 00:29:19.830
I had wonderful, wonderful parents.

00:29:19.830 --> 00:29:22.750
Wonderful mother, wonderful father.

00:29:22.750 --> 00:29:27.350 position:56%
Sometimes I would be out and working
in the field, in the hot sun,

00:29:27.350 --> 00:29:30.010
picking cotton, pulling corn,

00:29:30.010 --> 00:29:36.570
gathering peanuts, and
I would fall behind.

00:29:36.570 --> 00:29:38.680
My mother would say, "Boy,
you're falling behind.

00:29:38.680 --> 00:29:39.980
You need to catch up."

00:29:39.980 --> 00:29:42.170
I would say, "This is hard work.

00:29:42.170 --> 00:29:44.740
This is hard work."

00:29:44.740 --> 00:29:46.890
She would say, "Hard work
never killed anybody."

00:29:46.890 --> 00:29:51.690
I said, "Well, it's
about to kill me."

00:29:51.690 --> 00:29:56.400
My mother and my father
taught me the dignity

00:29:56.400 --> 00:30:00.070
of work, and not giving up.

00:30:00.070 --> 00:30:01.870
Not giving in.

00:30:01.870 --> 00:30:03.430
They were persistent.

00:30:03.430 --> 00:30:09.440
They didn't like the idea
of me getting involved

00:30:09.440 --> 00:30:12.330
in the Civil Rights Movement,
because they were afraid

00:30:12.330 --> 00:30:17.460
that something was
going to happen to me.

00:30:17.460 --> 00:30:26.370
My mother would say to me, over and
over again, "Don't get in trouble."

00:30:26.370 --> 00:30:29.190
As I said earlier, I got in trouble

00:30:29.190 --> 00:30:33.010
but it was good trouble,
necessary trouble.

00:30:33.010 --> 00:30:36.140
She couldn't even register to vote,

00:30:36.140 --> 00:30:38.360
until after the voting
rights was passed.

00:30:38.360 --> 00:30:43.740
My uncles, my teachers
couldn't register to vote.

00:30:43.740 --> 00:30:45.040
They were told they could not
read and write well enough.

00:30:45.040 --> 00:30:46.470
They were lawyers and doctors,
but these people kept fighting.

00:30:46.470 --> 00:30:47.770
They didn't give up.

00:30:47.770 --> 00:30:49.070
They didn't give in.

00:30:49.070 --> 00:30:50.370
They all inspired me.

00:30:50.370 --> 00:30:52.520
&gt;&gt; AUDIENCE: My name is David
Smith, and I'm in seventh grade.

00:30:52.520 --> 00:30:56.180
Have you ever felt defeated, and
if you have, what inspired you

00:30:56.180 --> 00:30:58.970
to keep on going [inaudible]?

00:30:58.970 --> 00:31:01.220
&gt;&gt; JOHN LEWIS: Well, it's
a very good question.

00:31:01.220 --> 00:31:06.330
Sometimes you're knocked
down, but you have to get up.

00:31:06.330 --> 00:31:08.500
Get arrested, go to jail.

00:31:08.500 --> 00:31:14.420
On the Freedom Rides,
in May of 1961,

00:31:14.420 --> 00:31:24.120
the same year President
Obama was born, in 1961,

00:31:24.120 --> 00:31:29.130
when we left Washington, D.C.,

00:31:29.130 --> 00:31:33.220
traveled through the
south, we were arrested.

00:31:33.220 --> 00:31:35.680
We were jailed.

00:31:35.680 --> 00:31:37.330
We were left bloody, not just
in Rock Hill, South Carolina,

00:31:37.330 --> 00:31:38.860
but at the Greyhound bus
station in Montgomery was black

00:31:38.860 --> 00:31:40.450
and white Freedom Riders, but we
were seated together on a bus,

00:31:40.450 --> 00:31:41.890
in a waiting room, trying to
get something to eat together,

00:31:41.890 --> 00:31:43.880
at a lunch counter there
in the bus station.

00:31:43.880 --> 00:31:53.630
Trying to use the same
restroom facilities.

00:31:53.630 --> 00:31:59.620
We made it to Mississippi.

00:31:59.620 --> 00:32:09.310
We filled the city jail, the county
jail in Jackson, Mississippi.

00:32:09.310 --> 00:32:15.300
Then, more than 400 of us
were arrested and taken

00:32:15.300 --> 00:32:20.860
to the state penitentiary.

00:32:21.890 --> 00:32:24.680
We stayed there for about 44 days.

00:32:24.680 --> 00:32:27.920
But we won, because
President Kennedy

00:32:27.920 --> 00:32:34.840
and his brother Robert Kennedy,
the Attorney General, intervened,

00:32:34.840 --> 00:32:36.140
and those signs came tumbling down.

00:32:36.140 --> 00:32:37.440
They're gone.

00:32:37.440 --> 00:32:38.740
You won't see them
in Mississippi today.

00:32:38.740 --> 00:32:40.040
We had to continue going, going.

00:32:40.040 --> 00:32:41.340
So, I never feel defeated.

00:32:41.340 --> 00:32:42.640
I always felt, somehow, we were
going to have a great victory.

00:32:42.640 --> 00:32:43.940
[applause]

00:32:43.940 --> 00:32:45.240
&gt;&gt; AUDIENCE: My name's Alisa
and I'm in seventh grade.

00:32:45.240 --> 00:32:46.540
Throughout all your
challenges in history,

00:32:46.540 --> 00:32:51.040
do you think these experiences
made you weaker or stronger?

00:32:52.240 --> 00:33:00.440
&gt;&gt; JOHN LEWIS: I think what I've
experienced during the past more

00:33:00.440 --> 00:33:06.870
than 50 years have made me much
stronger and much more determined.

00:33:06.870 --> 00:33:12.120
Sometimes, when I'm even in
the Congress, in a meeting

00:33:12.120 --> 00:33:14.980
or on the floor of the
House of Representatives,

00:33:14.980 --> 00:33:18.200
I feel like I've passed
this way once before.

00:33:18.200 --> 00:33:26.550
This is easy, in comparison what
we went through during the sixties.

00:33:26.550 --> 00:33:31.720
Sometimes, Andrew, I
guess, has seen harder.

00:33:31.720 --> 00:33:37.040
You just can never give up, never
get lost in the sea of despair.

00:33:37.040 --> 00:33:49.890 position:56%
You have to keep your faith and keep
your eyes on the prize, on the goal.

00:33:49.890 --> 00:33:52.160
[applause]

00:33:52.160 --> 00:33:54.250
&gt;&gt; AUDIENCE: My name
is Maggie [inaudible],

00:33:54.250 --> 00:33:56.740
and I'm in seventh grade.

00:33:56.740 --> 00:34:09.810
Did your parents support you in
what you wanted to do, and if not,

00:34:09.810 --> 00:34:14.330 position:56%
did that make you work harder in it?

00:34:14.330 --> 00:34:17.530
&gt;&gt; JOHN LEWIS: In the very,
very beginning, my mother,

00:34:17.530 --> 00:34:22.650
more so than my father were
very troubled that I was going

00:34:22.650 --> 00:34:28.740
to get hurt, or something
would happen to me.

00:34:28.740 --> 00:34:31.290
She thought we would lose the land,

00:34:31.290 --> 00:34:37.380
that our home would
be bombed, or burned.

00:34:37.380 --> 00:34:40.990
But, in the end, she became
very, very supportive,

00:34:40.990 --> 00:34:49.620
especially after President Johnson
signed the Voting Rights Act,

00:34:49.620 --> 00:34:50.920
because she could become
a registered voter.

00:34:50.920 --> 00:34:52.220
Her father, my grandfather,
could become a registered voter.

00:34:52.220 --> 00:34:53.520
And so she became a crusader

00:34:53.520 --> 00:34:54.820
that everybody should
get registered and vote.

00:34:54.820 --> 00:34:56.120
[applause]

00:34:56.120 --> 00:34:57.420
&gt;&gt; AUDIENCE: Did you ever
take pity on the ones

00:34:57.420 --> 00:34:58.720
who discriminate against you?

00:34:58.720 --> 00:35:02.620 position:56%
&gt;&gt; JOHN LEWIS: Did I ever take pity?

00:35:02.620 --> 00:35:08.210
On the people who discriminated
against me?

00:35:08.210 --> 00:35:14.470
I felt sorry, I guess, in a sense,

00:35:14.470 --> 00:35:18.380
and feeling maybe they really
don't understand why they shouldn't

00:35:18.380 --> 00:35:22.470
discriminate against someone.

00:35:22.470 --> 00:35:24.430
Let's take this room.

00:35:24.430 --> 00:35:25.730
This is a store.

00:35:25.730 --> 00:35:32.100
This is a store, and everybody
can come in, everybody.

00:35:32.100 --> 00:35:35.370
It doesn't matter whether
you're black, white, Latino,

00:35:35.370 --> 00:35:36.700
Asian-American, Native American.

00:35:36.700 --> 00:35:38.790
Everybody can come in.

00:35:38.790 --> 00:35:44.300
You have a restaurant,
you have a lunch counter,

00:35:44.300 --> 00:35:50.360
and only white people could
eat at that lunch counter.

00:35:52.280 --> 00:35:53.810
How would you feel?

00:35:53.810 --> 00:35:58.710
How would you feel if you come
into a store, there's a nice,

00:35:58.710 --> 00:36:06.630
shining fountain, saying "white",
and then next to that fountain,

00:36:06.630 --> 00:36:11.170
there's a little spigot,
just saying "colored".

00:36:11.170 --> 00:36:13.010
If you come and visit
my congressional office

00:36:13.010 --> 00:36:15.580
across the street, you
will see a photograph,

00:36:15.580 --> 00:36:18.540
a [inaudible] the photograph
in the [inaudible] room,

00:36:18.540 --> 00:36:26.390
showing what existed during the
sixties, and fifties, the forties.

00:36:26.390 --> 00:36:27.690
That's not right.

00:36:27.690 --> 00:36:29.990
That's not fair.

00:36:31.500 --> 00:36:36.010
You're invited to come in, but
you're going to be segregated

00:36:36.010 --> 00:36:39.160
because of your race, your color.

00:36:41.270 --> 00:36:52.220
We have to try to teach people,
and educate people to come

00:36:52.220 --> 00:36:53.520
to the point where we are today.

00:36:53.520 --> 00:36:54.820
[applause]

00:36:54.820 --> 00:36:56.120
&gt;&gt; ANDREW AYDIN: Do you mind
if I just add one part to that?

00:36:56.120 --> 00:37:01.880
I think there's an integral
part to what has happened

00:37:01.880 --> 00:37:05.810
in our society today stems
from that fundamental conflict.

00:37:05.810 --> 00:37:10.450
Let's put it this way.

00:37:10.450 --> 00:37:15.490
When John Lewis first sat in,
if they had actually allowed him

00:37:15.490 --> 00:37:20.390
to eat, he didn't have a dollar
to pay for that sandwich.

00:37:22.450 --> 00:37:24.380
Play that out today.

00:37:24.380 --> 00:37:28.420
It's one thing to allow the
integration of facilities.

00:37:28.420 --> 00:37:34.650
It's another to ensure that
every human being has the means

00:37:34.650 --> 00:37:38.980
to patronize that facility,
to pay for that sandwich.

00:37:38.980 --> 00:37:41.540
When you think about
the conflicts today,

00:37:41.540 --> 00:37:44.640
think about not only the
integration of the facilities,

00:37:44.640 --> 00:37:47.730
but the fundamental right
of every human being to eat,

00:37:47.730 --> 00:37:51.910
to be treated equally, to
have those same experiences,

00:37:51.910 --> 00:37:54.040
and have the right
to earn those means.

00:37:54.040 --> 00:38:02.030
That's all I wanted to say.

00:38:02.030 --> 00:38:03.330
[applause]

00:38:03.330 --> 00:38:04.670
&gt;&gt; AUDIENCE: How did you feel

00:38:04.670 --> 00:38:08.760
about segregated schools
when you attended?

00:38:08.760 --> 00:38:14.940
&gt;&gt; JOHN LEWIS: As a young
student, I didn't like it.

00:38:14.940 --> 00:38:23.130
First of all, the school was
poorly staffed, overcrowded ...

00:38:23.130 --> 00:38:26.410
The black school.

00:38:26.410 --> 00:38:33.580
We had the hand-me-down books, with
other people's names in the book.

00:38:33.580 --> 00:38:36.970
We rode in broken-down buses.

00:38:36.970 --> 00:38:42.440
We passed the nice,
newly built white school.

00:38:42.440 --> 00:38:44.530
I didn't like it.

00:38:44.530 --> 00:38:48.590
So, when the Supreme Court
decision came down in 1954,

00:38:48.590 --> 00:38:52.990
I was 14 years old but I
remember it like it was yesterday.

00:38:52.990 --> 00:39:01.790
I thought we would be going to
an integrated school, with black

00:39:04.900 --> 00:39:16.860
and white students would be
attending the same school,

00:39:16.860 --> 00:39:22.450
but it never happened for me.

00:39:22.450 --> 00:39:25.300
I was glad when the
decision came down.

00:39:25.300 --> 00:39:30.190
It did [inaudible]
kept pushing in change.

00:39:30.190 --> 00:39:36.030
We still have problems today
that we must continue to work on.

00:39:36.030 --> 00:39:37.610
We're not there yet.

00:39:37.610 --> 00:39:43.400
Dr. King used to speak
about the beloved community,

00:39:43.400 --> 00:39:44.700
where we lay down the
burden of race.

00:39:44.700 --> 00:39:46.000
We're on our way, but
we're not there.

00:39:46.000 --> 00:39:47.300
As young people, as young
students, as you grow up,

00:39:47.300 --> 00:39:48.600 position:56%
you've got to continue to do what
you can, so no one will be left out,

00:39:48.600 --> 00:39:49.900
and left behind because
of their race,

00:39:49.900 --> 00:39:51.200
their color, their nationality.

00:39:51.200 --> 00:39:52.500
[applause]

00:39:52.500 --> 00:39:53.800
&gt;&gt; KAREN JAFFE: We want to
thank you so much, both of you.

00:39:53.800 --> 00:39:55.100
&gt;&gt; JOHN LEWIS: Thank you.

00:39:55.100 --> 00:40:01.760
&gt;&gt; KAREN JAFFE: It was
a wonderful program.

00:40:01.760 --> 00:40:03.060
[applause]

00:40:03.060 --> 00:40:10.450
&gt;&gt; I'd like to have to
school chaperones and faculty

00:40:10.450 --> 00:40:24.430
to help get the students
up in an orderly fashion,

00:40:24.430 --> 00:40:33.100
so that we can give you
the books from Target,

00:40:33.100 --> 00:40:41.440
and Everybody Wins D.C., okay?

00:40:41.440 --> 00:40:57.770
&gt;&gt; JOHN LEWIS: Thank you
so much for having us here.

00:40:59.380 --> 00:41:09.470
Thank you so much.

00:41:09.470 --> 00:41:19.080
[applause] [background talk]

00:41:19.080 --> 00:41:24.990
&gt;&gt; This has been a presentation
of the Library of Congress.
