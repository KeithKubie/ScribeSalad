00:00:01.992 --> 00:00:03.480
LIV WU: Hi, everyone.

00:00:03.480 --> 00:00:05.620
Welcome.

00:00:05.620 --> 00:00:09.620
Thanks for showing up in such
a nice numbers on a Friday

00:00:09.620 --> 00:00:14.610
afternoon before Easter.

00:00:14.610 --> 00:00:18.264
Did you know we were
going to pour wine?

00:00:18.264 --> 00:00:19.602
You did?

00:00:19.602 --> 00:00:22.440
I thought I kept it a secret.

00:00:22.440 --> 00:00:26.020
It was a test to see how
many of you would come.

00:00:26.020 --> 00:00:28.870
So thank you for coming.

00:00:28.870 --> 00:00:31.220
And I didn't have
to know the numbers

00:00:31.220 --> 00:00:35.650
because I had to figure
out how many wines to get,

00:00:35.650 --> 00:00:38.950
because these wines
are not easy to get.

00:00:38.950 --> 00:00:44.370
Trust my friend, Jon, to
write about rarer wines.

00:00:44.370 --> 00:00:45.720
Anyway, welcome.

00:00:45.720 --> 00:00:47.150
My name is Liv Wu.

00:00:47.150 --> 00:00:50.790
I'm on the Mountain
View food team.

00:00:50.790 --> 00:00:55.170
I was hired six years
ago as an executive chef.

00:00:55.170 --> 00:00:57.770
But now I'm a program manager.

00:00:57.770 --> 00:01:01.190
And very happy that
we have Kitchen

00:01:01.190 --> 00:01:03.310
Sink, the download on food.

00:01:03.310 --> 00:01:07.070
That's the official
name of this glass cube.

00:01:07.070 --> 00:01:09.110
It's a mouthful, and it
still doesn't tell you

00:01:09.110 --> 00:01:14.070
that it's a teaching
kitchen, which is what it is.

00:01:14.070 --> 00:01:19.260
The food team believes
passionately in not just

00:01:19.260 --> 00:01:22.980
giving you the fish, but
teaching you how to fish.

00:01:22.980 --> 00:01:28.540
And so we have created this
place-- this lab, this studio,

00:01:28.540 --> 00:01:32.660
if you want-- for you
to play in and to learn,

00:01:32.660 --> 00:01:36.370
as much as you want
to, about food.

00:01:36.370 --> 00:01:41.250
Including that very
essential ingredient, wine.

00:01:41.250 --> 00:01:45.330
And so we do want to
learn a lot about wine.

00:01:45.330 --> 00:01:48.000
And I am absolutely
thrilled to have

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:53.730
as my first guest this expert
and my dear friend, Jon Bonne,

00:01:53.730 --> 00:01:56.690
wine editor for the
San Francisco Chronicle

00:01:56.690 --> 00:01:58.210
and my former colleague.

00:01:58.210 --> 00:01:59.036
Welcome.

00:01:59.036 --> 00:02:00.202
JON BONNE: Great to be here.

00:02:00.202 --> 00:02:01.675
Thank you guys for coming.

00:02:05.120 --> 00:02:10.590
LIV WU: So John came to
the Chronicle in 4006?

00:02:10.590 --> 00:02:14.040
4006.

00:02:14.040 --> 00:02:14.650
OK.

00:02:14.650 --> 00:02:17.162
JON BONNE: Glad I got
in the time machine.

00:02:17.162 --> 00:02:17.750
2006.

00:02:17.750 --> 00:02:19.640
LIV WU: 2006.

00:02:19.640 --> 00:02:21.980
And I left in 2008.

00:02:21.980 --> 00:02:25.880
But was an amazing colleague.

00:02:25.880 --> 00:02:31.430
Just the depth and breadth
of knowledge about wine.

00:02:31.430 --> 00:02:34.430
Spoken sometimes in
a lovely geeky way--

00:02:34.430 --> 00:02:40.850
this is what I loved about him--
just endeared himself to me.

00:02:40.850 --> 00:02:43.850
I put myself at
his feet and tried

00:02:43.850 --> 00:02:46.280
to learn about tasting wine.

00:02:46.280 --> 00:02:49.850
Wednesday mornings,
50 to 80 wines

00:02:49.850 --> 00:02:52.220
that we poured and tasted.

00:02:52.220 --> 00:02:54.010
And we spit.

00:02:54.010 --> 00:02:55.070
On Wednesday morning.

00:02:55.070 --> 00:02:56.528
JON BONNE: In two
and a half hours.

00:02:56.528 --> 00:02:57.970
LIV WU: In two and a half hours.

00:02:57.970 --> 00:03:02.740
To go through all the wines that
come through the Chronicle wine

00:03:02.740 --> 00:03:04.130
selection.

00:03:04.130 --> 00:03:08.830
So Jon was in Seattle before
he came to San Francisco.

00:03:08.830 --> 00:03:15.040
He was with MSNBC, writing
about lifestyles and wine.

00:03:15.040 --> 00:03:17.380
He's also been published
in the New York

00:03:17.380 --> 00:03:20.110
Times, and various
food magazines

00:03:20.110 --> 00:03:21.930
and tabloid magazines.

00:03:21.930 --> 00:03:24.500
So he is really knowledgeable.

00:03:24.500 --> 00:03:28.210
And we did many a
series of stories,

00:03:28.210 --> 00:03:30.200
together, that we
loved doing, which

00:03:30.200 --> 00:03:33.970
was finding wines to
pair with Asian flavors.

00:03:33.970 --> 00:03:35.600
And that was just a lot of fun.

00:03:35.600 --> 00:03:37.512
A lot of fun cooking and--

00:03:37.512 --> 00:03:39.970
JON BONNE: I'm going to get
you back for one more of those.

00:03:39.970 --> 00:03:40.660
LIV WU: OK.

00:03:40.660 --> 00:03:41.620
It's a deal.

00:03:41.620 --> 00:03:43.390
Thank you for coming.

00:03:43.390 --> 00:03:48.450
So I get to do something
with him I've never done,

00:03:48.450 --> 00:03:51.680
which is-- we each
interview a lot of people

00:03:51.680 --> 00:03:56.010
and did a lot of reporting, but
I get to interview him, now.

00:03:56.010 --> 00:04:00.180
So tell me what was
the genesis of the book

00:04:00.180 --> 00:04:05.310
and why you decided to
say yes even though you

00:04:05.310 --> 00:04:09.330
had this label that kind of
sat on top of you that said,

00:04:09.330 --> 00:04:12.290
he hates California wine.

00:04:12.290 --> 00:04:15.190
That was what was
said about him.

00:04:15.190 --> 00:04:18.217
And even though I
knew it was not true.

00:04:18.217 --> 00:04:19.800
JON BONNE: This
specific genesis of it

00:04:19.800 --> 00:04:23.480
was this piece I did for
"Saveur" magazine, in 2010,

00:04:23.480 --> 00:04:25.532
called "The New
California Wine," which

00:04:25.532 --> 00:04:28.210
made it seemed like it
was a very smart thing

00:04:28.210 --> 00:04:30.100
to then turn into a book.

00:04:30.100 --> 00:04:32.420
But you probably know
better than anyone

00:04:32.420 --> 00:04:35.840
else what it was like for
me when I came out here.

00:04:35.840 --> 00:04:40.230
I didn't inherently have
anything against California

00:04:40.230 --> 00:04:41.920
wine but I had
grown up with wine

00:04:41.920 --> 00:04:46.280
from California and
elsewhere, in New York.

00:04:46.280 --> 00:04:50.060
And had started
writing about wine

00:04:50.060 --> 00:04:52.940
when I moved to the
West coast, in Seattle.

00:04:52.940 --> 00:04:57.120
And had this amazing explosion
to witness of Northwest wines,

00:04:57.120 --> 00:04:59.310
that I absolutely
fell in love with.

00:04:59.310 --> 00:05:01.654
And would continually
taste California,

00:05:01.654 --> 00:05:03.070
because when you
write about wine,

00:05:03.070 --> 00:05:04.520
you have to taste from all over.

00:05:04.520 --> 00:05:06.651
And was really
persistently disappointed,

00:05:06.651 --> 00:05:09.150
and wondered what happened from
this time, when I was a kid,

00:05:09.150 --> 00:05:11.870
and my father was
teaching me about wine.

00:05:11.870 --> 00:05:14.570
And we would taste wines
from Mondavi and whoever,

00:05:14.570 --> 00:05:17.000
and they were
certainly very good.

00:05:17.000 --> 00:05:21.350
And this was, at that point,
sort of, early '80s, I'd say.

00:05:21.350 --> 00:05:25.120
And jumping forward
20 years or so,

00:05:25.120 --> 00:05:28.600
really why there was no
real interest for me.

00:05:28.600 --> 00:05:31.560
And then, of course, I got hired
by the San Francisco Chronicle

00:05:31.560 --> 00:05:33.200
to write about wine.

00:05:33.200 --> 00:05:39.260
Notably California wine, which
was a bold move on their part.

00:05:39.260 --> 00:05:43.580
And what became
clear, I started out

00:05:43.580 --> 00:05:48.000
looking for any signs of hope.

00:05:48.000 --> 00:05:51.380
And, actually, kept finding
them here and there.

00:05:51.380 --> 00:05:54.500
The first really significant
one was not far from here.

00:05:54.500 --> 00:05:57.680
I had chose the
winemaker of the year

00:05:57.680 --> 00:06:00.180
two weeks after I got there.

00:06:00.180 --> 00:06:01.700
And chose Paul Draper at Ridge.

00:06:01.700 --> 00:06:04.870
And so, actually, didn't even
make the trek to Cupertino,

00:06:04.870 --> 00:06:06.820
because he was in
London and had to spend

00:06:06.820 --> 00:06:09.630
three hours on the
phone with him,

00:06:09.630 --> 00:06:12.790
when he was in London
after slightly tipsy lunch,

00:06:12.790 --> 00:06:15.140
getting my winemaker
interview done.

00:06:15.140 --> 00:06:17.180
But found him.

00:06:17.180 --> 00:06:20.810
Found Josh Jensen at Calera,
down in San Benito County

00:06:20.810 --> 00:06:24.110
the next year, who really
pioneered terroir-driven Pinot

00:06:24.110 --> 00:06:26.590
Noir in this country.

00:06:26.590 --> 00:06:28.990
Kept finding more
and more people.

00:06:28.990 --> 00:06:32.140
And realized, especially,
that there was this younger

00:06:32.140 --> 00:06:36.240
generation of
winemakers who were,

00:06:36.240 --> 00:06:39.882
at first, it seemed, just
making interesting side projects

00:06:39.882 --> 00:06:41.090
and working around the edges.

00:06:41.090 --> 00:06:43.390
And then, by about 2010,
it became really clear

00:06:43.390 --> 00:06:45.600
that what they were
doing-- and I don't even

00:06:45.600 --> 00:06:47.860
think they knew
it, particularly--

00:06:47.860 --> 00:06:51.075
was changing the dialogue
about California wine

00:06:51.075 --> 00:06:54.200
and what it represented, and
how the world would perceive it.

00:06:54.200 --> 00:06:57.750
And that really, ultimately,
what they were beginning to do

00:06:57.750 --> 00:07:00.020
and, I think, have
done, is as important,

00:07:00.020 --> 00:07:03.070
culturally, as what the great
pioneers of the late '60s

00:07:03.070 --> 00:07:06.520
and early '70s did, here, the
Robert Mondavis and the Warren

00:07:06.520 --> 00:07:07.030
Winiarskis.

00:07:07.030 --> 00:07:09.950
Which is to make
wine from California

00:07:09.950 --> 00:07:16.050
they felt was as relevant and
as site-specific and as driven

00:07:16.050 --> 00:07:19.380
by a sense of
place as great wine

00:07:19.380 --> 00:07:21.400
from anywhere else in the world.

00:07:21.400 --> 00:07:24.400
LIV WU: There were
the greats of the '70s

00:07:24.400 --> 00:07:25.970
and the Judgment of Paris.

00:07:25.970 --> 00:07:28.780
And then was there a real fall?

00:07:28.780 --> 00:07:30.080
What happened?

00:07:30.080 --> 00:07:31.500
Why did they go off course?

00:07:31.500 --> 00:07:32.958
JON BONNE: There
was a fall but not

00:07:32.958 --> 00:07:35.630
in the way people
perceive it, necessarily.

00:07:35.630 --> 00:07:38.180
So the '80s were this
transitional time.

00:07:38.180 --> 00:07:42.120
A lot of wineries grew
very fast and very big.

00:07:42.120 --> 00:07:44.110
And started making
what they called,

00:07:44.110 --> 00:07:45.650
at the time,
"fighting varietals,"

00:07:45.650 --> 00:07:47.300
which were valuable.

00:07:47.300 --> 00:07:51.220
This is when the notion of $10
Chardonnay or $8 Chardonnay

00:07:51.220 --> 00:07:53.130
really appeared
for the first time.

00:07:53.130 --> 00:07:54.930
Or Merlot or Cabernet.

00:07:54.930 --> 00:07:58.910
Rather than buying wine known
by a place or by something

00:07:58.910 --> 00:08:02.290
like Mountain Chablis, which
meant absolutely nothing.

00:08:02.290 --> 00:08:06.930
That you would buy a specific
type of grape and, typically,

00:08:06.930 --> 00:08:08.565
it was from California.

00:08:08.565 --> 00:08:10.690
And it wasn't more specific
than that and, in part,

00:08:10.690 --> 00:08:13.790
that was because,
as they grew, you

00:08:13.790 --> 00:08:15.604
started making
millions of cases.

00:08:15.604 --> 00:08:17.270
You had to go out to
the Central Valley.

00:08:17.270 --> 00:08:21.580
You had to find cheaper and
more industrially farmed grapes.

00:08:21.580 --> 00:08:24.900
And find ways to
grow your business

00:08:24.900 --> 00:08:26.620
to make the numbers work.

00:08:26.620 --> 00:08:27.630
So that was one piece.

00:08:27.630 --> 00:08:32.809
And then the other
piece was that really,

00:08:32.809 --> 00:08:37.565
starting in the late '60s
through the mid to late '80s,

00:08:37.565 --> 00:08:42.840
the advice that UC Davis
was giving to vineyardists

00:08:42.840 --> 00:08:47.050
was to plant their vineyards
on a rootstock called AxR1.

00:08:47.050 --> 00:08:50.984
And the way that
vineyards work, really

00:08:50.984 --> 00:08:52.400
almost everywhere
in the world, is

00:08:52.400 --> 00:08:57.360
that every vine is
essentially a mutant.

00:08:57.360 --> 00:08:58.150
It's a hybrid.

00:09:00.920 --> 00:09:07.210
The vinifera vine-- that
specific genus, I think--

00:09:07.210 --> 00:09:10.954
is susceptible to
a number of things,

00:09:10.954 --> 00:09:13.120
and particularly, to a vine
louse called phylloxera.

00:09:13.120 --> 00:09:15.330
Phylloxera destroyed most
of the world's vineyards

00:09:15.330 --> 00:09:16.260
of the 19th century.

00:09:16.260 --> 00:09:18.857
Destroyed them again
in places in the 20th.

00:09:18.857 --> 00:09:20.440
And so it's always
been this challenge

00:09:20.440 --> 00:09:27.190
to find a way to prevent
this pest from eradicating

00:09:27.190 --> 00:09:30.630
huge, huge portions of vineyard.

00:09:30.630 --> 00:09:34.370
So what would you do is you
take a resistant rootstock.

00:09:34.370 --> 00:09:35.760
You graft the vine on top.

00:09:35.760 --> 00:09:38.800
And almost every vine planted
in the state of California

00:09:38.800 --> 00:09:39.640
is it that way.

00:09:39.640 --> 00:09:42.201
And actually almost every
vine planted in France, Italy,

00:09:42.201 --> 00:09:44.075
Spain-- pretty much
everywhere in the world--

00:09:44.075 --> 00:09:45.860
is planted that way.

00:09:45.860 --> 00:09:49.280
So AxR was this great
solution to them.

00:09:49.280 --> 00:09:50.582
And it was good for yield.

00:09:50.582 --> 00:09:51.790
It was good for productivity.

00:09:51.790 --> 00:09:53.920
It was drought tolerant.

00:09:53.920 --> 00:09:56.080
It had a slight problem
with phylloxera.

00:09:56.080 --> 00:09:57.440
It wasn't entirely resistant.

00:09:57.440 --> 00:09:59.309
But you go back and
you look at the text.

00:09:59.309 --> 00:10:01.600
And they actually say, you
know, we think it's so good,

00:10:01.600 --> 00:10:04.060
that the lack of
resistance probably

00:10:04.060 --> 00:10:05.680
isn't going to be an issue.

00:10:05.680 --> 00:10:09.080
So by the late '80s, I
would say almost all,

00:10:09.080 --> 00:10:11.320
but an enormous portion
California's vineyards had

00:10:11.320 --> 00:10:13.110
been wiped out by phylloxera.

00:10:13.110 --> 00:10:17.130
For, at the time, over a
billion dollars of replanting.

00:10:17.130 --> 00:10:21.820
So after this huge boom, there
was this replanting that came.

00:10:21.820 --> 00:10:24.500
And at the same time, there was
a ton of money that showed up.

00:10:24.500 --> 00:10:26.440
This is going in the early '90s.

00:10:26.440 --> 00:10:29.980
And so, especially in Napa,
there were these new vineyards.

00:10:29.980 --> 00:10:31.880
And new vineyards do
one thing very well,

00:10:31.880 --> 00:10:36.270
which is to produce fruit very
fast at very high sugar levels.

00:10:36.270 --> 00:10:39.240
And you have an
influx of investors

00:10:39.240 --> 00:10:41.397
who were interested in wine.

00:10:41.397 --> 00:10:42.980
Might not have known
a lot about wine,

00:10:42.980 --> 00:10:45.940
but we're curious and
wanted to get in there

00:10:45.940 --> 00:10:47.640
and get famous quick.

00:10:47.640 --> 00:10:51.470
And you had vineyards that
would make these big, ripe, very

00:10:51.470 --> 00:10:54.640
expressive wines, even
if they weren't complex.

00:10:54.640 --> 00:10:57.220
And you also had critics who
suddenly decided that, rather

00:10:57.220 --> 00:10:59.220
than these much more
structured, much more

00:10:59.220 --> 00:11:02.600
classic wines that people have
been interested in before,

00:11:02.600 --> 00:11:04.350
the bigger, the better.

00:11:04.350 --> 00:11:06.480
And this is what's,
in the book, called

00:11:06.480 --> 00:11:08.670
"The Beginning of the
Era of Big Flavor."

00:11:08.670 --> 00:11:11.887
Where there was no upper limit.

00:11:11.887 --> 00:11:12.970
That's how I would put it.

00:11:12.970 --> 00:11:16.972
And so, in a way, that was
a mark of great success.

00:11:16.972 --> 00:11:18.930
Because all of a sudden,
there were these wines

00:11:18.930 --> 00:11:21.720
that had no track record that
were coming out and getting

00:11:21.720 --> 00:11:26.310
97, 98, 99, 100
points from critics.

00:11:26.310 --> 00:11:28.920
And people were going a
little crazy over them.

00:11:28.920 --> 00:11:29.520
They were big.

00:11:29.520 --> 00:11:30.840
They were flashy.

00:11:30.840 --> 00:11:33.680
They were increasingly
very expensive.

00:11:33.680 --> 00:11:35.900
And so, if you didn't
know a lot about wine

00:11:35.900 --> 00:11:39.970
but you knew that 99
was better than 95

00:11:39.970 --> 00:11:43.880
and you were looking for a way
to get a connoisseurship very

00:11:43.880 --> 00:11:46.180
quickly, these were
wines that would do it

00:11:46.180 --> 00:11:49.200
without having to sort of
go through the boring part

00:11:49.200 --> 00:11:52.210
of learning about terroir
and looking for wines

00:11:52.210 --> 00:11:54.210
that had a specific
track record.

00:11:54.210 --> 00:11:56.640
And so it's hard
to say that that

00:11:56.640 --> 00:12:01.290
was a decline, because
obviously, in a way,

00:12:01.290 --> 00:12:02.210
it was a success.

00:12:02.210 --> 00:12:04.660
But it also chased a lot
of very serious people

00:12:04.660 --> 00:12:05.750
out of the industry.

00:12:05.750 --> 00:12:08.970
LIV WU: So give me a
sense of the wines that

00:12:08.970 --> 00:12:16.110
were scored 95, 96, 97, 99 by
wine enthusiasts or by somebody

00:12:16.110 --> 00:12:19.130
else we won't
mention, quite yet.

00:12:19.130 --> 00:12:21.404
How were you scoring them?

00:12:21.404 --> 00:12:22.820
JON BONNE: Luckily,
at that point,

00:12:22.820 --> 00:12:25.610
I was-- well, when that
started, I was still in college.

00:12:25.610 --> 00:12:27.160
So I was I not scoring anything.

00:12:27.160 --> 00:12:30.710
Because I was drinking cheap
Chilean wine, anything, out

00:12:30.710 --> 00:12:32.600
of a jug.

00:12:32.600 --> 00:12:36.287
But when I got to the Chronicle
and these wines would,

00:12:36.287 --> 00:12:37.870
at least some of
them, come before me.

00:12:37.870 --> 00:12:42.020
Because really, the ones who
reach that truly top pinnacle,

00:12:42.020 --> 00:12:45.180
they would get in this
thing where, typically, you

00:12:45.180 --> 00:12:48.640
would send a wine critic wine
and they would review it.

00:12:48.640 --> 00:12:50.410
But they got to this
place where they

00:12:50.410 --> 00:12:52.810
felt that the only way that
a critic would properly

00:12:52.810 --> 00:12:54.700
understand it was if
they came to the winery

00:12:54.700 --> 00:12:56.385
and they tasted it
with the winemaker

00:12:56.385 --> 00:12:58.310
and tasted it in context.

00:12:58.310 --> 00:13:01.010
And got to, therefore, get a
complete sense of the wine.

00:13:01.010 --> 00:13:02.759
So if you want to go
and taste, let's say,

00:13:02.759 --> 00:13:07.542
a Screaming Eagle, or Harlan,
you would make the trip.

00:13:07.542 --> 00:13:09.750
Because otherwise you wouldn't
get to taste the wine.

00:13:09.750 --> 00:13:13.960
And if you were a critic who
was trafficking in such things,

00:13:13.960 --> 00:13:16.720
you would look
like a chump if you

00:13:16.720 --> 00:13:18.660
didn't have that in your roster.

00:13:18.660 --> 00:13:19.550
How did I score them?

00:13:19.550 --> 00:13:21.100
Not very well.

00:13:21.100 --> 00:13:23.110
And that was, part
of it is, I got here

00:13:23.110 --> 00:13:26.380
with some notion of a
frustration about California.

00:13:26.380 --> 00:13:28.830
And then was encountering a
lot of these wines-- not all

00:13:28.830 --> 00:13:29.840
of them, some of
them were well made,

00:13:29.840 --> 00:13:32.030
but a lot these wines--
over and over again,

00:13:32.030 --> 00:13:33.630
that were just monotonous.

00:13:33.630 --> 00:13:38.750
They tasted like raisins,
and oak, and alcohol.

00:13:38.750 --> 00:13:40.670
And the thing was
that it was, and we'll

00:13:40.670 --> 00:13:43.550
talk more sure about the
details of this a little bit,

00:13:43.550 --> 00:13:48.860
but it was people
pushing grape growing

00:13:48.860 --> 00:13:54.990
beyond the bounds of
natural chemistry.

00:13:54.990 --> 00:13:57.860
And some of it was that there
was a rise of technology

00:13:57.860 --> 00:14:01.370
in the '90s, really,
that allowed people

00:14:01.370 --> 00:14:04.970
to go far beyond the adjustments
they had ever made, to really

00:14:04.970 --> 00:14:07.610
kind of tweak wine, to make
it taste however they wanted.

00:14:07.610 --> 00:14:12.850
So rather than think about how
you would take a grape grown

00:14:12.850 --> 00:14:15.060
to optimum ripeness,
pick it, make wine

00:14:15.060 --> 00:14:16.840
from it and, hopefully,
it would express

00:14:16.840 --> 00:14:18.900
some semblance of
where it was grown.

00:14:18.900 --> 00:14:21.830
You would just grow a
grape as ripe as you could,

00:14:21.830 --> 00:14:23.830
knowing that the things
that you were taking out

00:14:23.830 --> 00:14:26.630
of it-- for instance,
acidity, natural acidity-- you

00:14:26.630 --> 00:14:28.910
could just put it right back in.

00:14:28.910 --> 00:14:31.260
And that, one of the
things, for instance,

00:14:31.260 --> 00:14:35.970
that happens when you do
that, which is that-- wine

00:14:35.970 --> 00:14:39.390
is a slightly delicate,
microbial environment.

00:14:39.390 --> 00:14:43.030
When you have a wine
that's too low in acidity,

00:14:43.030 --> 00:14:45.620
it exposes itself
to bacterial taint--

00:14:45.620 --> 00:14:47.890
potential bacterial taint.

00:14:47.890 --> 00:14:50.470
But when you have all these
filtration techniques that

00:14:50.470 --> 00:14:53.335
showed up-- reverse
osmosis that showed up,

00:14:53.335 --> 00:14:55.293
something called Velcorin,
which was originally

00:14:55.293 --> 00:15:00.320
used in sports drinks, which
essentially biologically

00:15:00.320 --> 00:15:04.430
neutralizes whatever it's put
into-- then you don't have

00:15:04.430 --> 00:15:07.617
to worry about the natural
parameters of winemaking.

00:15:07.617 --> 00:15:08.990
LIV WU: Interesting.

00:15:08.990 --> 00:15:13.020
But then we can't
place all the blame

00:15:13.020 --> 00:15:15.920
on the critics that scored high.

00:15:15.920 --> 00:15:19.340
There had to be an
audience that loved

00:15:19.340 --> 00:15:25.210
big, in-your-face, jammy
wines, and high alcohol.

00:15:25.210 --> 00:15:25.890
Is that true?

00:15:25.890 --> 00:15:27.180
Is that part of the equation?

00:15:27.180 --> 00:15:28.760
JON BONNE: There
were, absolutely.

00:15:28.760 --> 00:15:32.406
And in part, whereas
wine had always

00:15:32.406 --> 00:15:34.030
been portrayed before
as something that

00:15:34.030 --> 00:15:37.050
was on the table-- to your
point about it being integrated

00:15:37.050 --> 00:15:40.090
into the program, here--
it was on the table,

00:15:40.090 --> 00:15:41.580
it was part of a meal.

00:15:41.580 --> 00:15:43.400
These wines were
really intended,

00:15:43.400 --> 00:15:45.740
and were largely
consumed, on their own.

00:15:45.740 --> 00:15:46.630
LIV WU: On their own.

00:15:46.630 --> 00:15:50.390
JON BONNE: And so you didn't
open up a blockbuster,

00:15:50.390 --> 00:15:53.150
thinking you would have it
with a Tuesday night dinner.

00:15:53.150 --> 00:15:55.350
You opened it up because
you wanted to be impressed

00:15:55.350 --> 00:15:57.183
and you wanted your
friends to be impressed.

00:15:57.183 --> 00:15:59.330
And you would sit
in awe of this wine

00:15:59.330 --> 00:16:03.350
that simply, kind of,
turned itself up to eleven.

00:16:03.350 --> 00:16:05.930
LIV WU: One the greatest
lessons I learned from you

00:16:05.930 --> 00:16:10.860
was that lower alcohol
red wines-- which

00:16:10.860 --> 00:16:15.010
are very hard to find, for
especially Asian flavors, which

00:16:15.010 --> 00:16:19.749
are so bold-- are the wines
that go well with food.

00:16:19.749 --> 00:16:20.540
JON BONNE: Usually.

00:16:20.540 --> 00:16:21.390
LIV WU: Usually.

00:16:21.390 --> 00:16:22.380
Right.

00:16:22.380 --> 00:16:26.650
Anything above 13.5,
14 is going to fight

00:16:26.650 --> 00:16:29.790
with the high-flavored food.

00:16:29.790 --> 00:16:31.450
JON BONNE: Yes.

00:16:31.450 --> 00:16:36.090
And the thing is, if your life
consists of going and eating

00:16:36.090 --> 00:16:39.500
rare filet mignon,
every night, then you

00:16:39.500 --> 00:16:42.640
might have a justification
for a 15% Cabernet

00:16:42.640 --> 00:16:45.390
or a 15% Zinfandel.

00:16:45.390 --> 00:16:50.290
And legitimately, there are
gastronomic contexts for those,

00:16:50.290 --> 00:16:54.220
but on balance, they
don't work well with food.

00:16:54.220 --> 00:16:55.980
And even, I think,
their defenders

00:16:55.980 --> 00:17:01.000
have largely given up on trying
to make the case that they're

00:17:01.000 --> 00:17:02.570
gastronomic wines.

00:17:02.570 --> 00:17:04.170
They want to be showpieces.

00:17:04.170 --> 00:17:08.770
LIV WU: So you wrote the book
based on the Saveur articles.

00:17:08.770 --> 00:17:14.420
And then you put this winemaker,
this wine grower, on the cover.

00:17:14.420 --> 00:17:18.960
Tell us about Mr. Lemon.

00:17:18.960 --> 00:17:23.200
JON BONNE: So Ted Lemon owns
a winery called Littorai.

00:17:23.200 --> 00:17:29.010
L-I-T-T-O-R-A-I. And he was
my 2010 winemaker of the year.

00:17:29.010 --> 00:17:33.880
And Ted is really one of my
favorite people in California.

00:17:33.880 --> 00:17:37.180
Among other things, he
was the first American

00:17:37.180 --> 00:17:39.050
to run a domain in Burgundy.

00:17:39.050 --> 00:17:40.460
He was 24 years old.

00:17:40.460 --> 00:17:44.880
He had studied in Dijon, I
think-- Dijon or Beaunne.

00:17:44.880 --> 00:17:48.470
And Domaine Guy Roulot, which
is really the greatest, or one

00:17:48.470 --> 00:17:50.210
of the greatest,
houses in the commune

00:17:50.210 --> 00:17:55.126
of Meursault, sort of one of
the top white wines in Burgundy.

00:17:55.126 --> 00:17:56.250
Their patriarchal had died.

00:17:56.250 --> 00:17:58.390
They needed someone to
come in and make the wines.

00:17:58.390 --> 00:18:00.850
And Ted was highly recommended.

00:18:00.850 --> 00:18:03.561
It was implied that
he wasn't going to,

00:18:03.561 --> 00:18:05.060
despite the fact
he was an American,

00:18:05.060 --> 00:18:07.329
he wasn't going to muck
around with things, too much.

00:18:07.329 --> 00:18:09.870
And would, more or less, keep
the winemaking style as it was.

00:18:09.870 --> 00:18:12.200
And so that was
his real tutelage.

00:18:12.200 --> 00:18:13.650
So he came back to the US.

00:18:13.650 --> 00:18:15.324
Came to California.

00:18:15.324 --> 00:18:17.490
And you would think, well,
he made wine in Burgundy.

00:18:17.490 --> 00:18:20.470
He's going to try to
make wines like Burgundy.

00:18:20.470 --> 00:18:22.270
And very quickly he
concluded that it

00:18:22.270 --> 00:18:23.940
was ludicrous to
try and do that.

00:18:23.940 --> 00:18:26.905
And that what you should do is
to take the best of the lessons

00:18:26.905 --> 00:18:30.940
that he had learned about
respecting soils which-- and he

00:18:30.940 --> 00:18:34.502
says it in the book-- Burgundy
did not often do very well,

00:18:34.502 --> 00:18:36.210
despite having, really,
some of the great

00:18:36.210 --> 00:18:37.357
terroirs in the world.

00:18:37.357 --> 00:18:38.940
But learning how to
respect the soils.

00:18:38.940 --> 00:18:40.090
Learning how to farm well.

00:18:40.090 --> 00:18:41.840
And really learning
how to make wines that

00:18:41.840 --> 00:18:43.840
are appropriate to their place.

00:18:43.840 --> 00:18:49.360
And began what's now, I guess,
about a 20-year endeavour

00:18:49.360 --> 00:18:51.720
to find these great vineyards.

00:18:51.720 --> 00:18:54.940
Littorai means, in Latin, it's
a derivative of the coasts.

00:18:54.940 --> 00:18:57.540
And so, running
essentially from,

00:18:57.540 --> 00:19:02.170
approximately, Sebastopol
up through Anderson valley.

00:19:02.170 --> 00:19:06.450
This winery that's essentially
a meditation on great vineyard

00:19:06.450 --> 00:19:09.820
sites near the Pacific coast.

00:19:09.820 --> 00:19:12.020
Which would, in and of
itself, be interesting.

00:19:12.020 --> 00:19:14.180
But Ted also is one of
the most diligent farmers

00:19:14.180 --> 00:19:16.120
I have ever met.

00:19:16.120 --> 00:19:21.310
He practices biodynamics, which
is, sort of, organics beyond.

00:19:21.310 --> 00:19:23.449
But not even Steinerien
biodynamics--

00:19:23.449 --> 00:19:25.490
although he would argue
it's classical Steinerian

00:19:25.490 --> 00:19:28.770
biodynamics-- but
he's pushed aside

00:19:28.770 --> 00:19:32.600
the by-the-numbers
version of biodynamics

00:19:32.600 --> 00:19:34.650
and really started
working with consultants

00:19:34.650 --> 00:19:38.650
who looked at agroecology.

00:19:38.650 --> 00:19:44.110
And looked at farming your
farm as a holistic unit.

00:19:44.110 --> 00:19:46.540
Which involves figuring out
appropriate cover crops.

00:19:46.540 --> 00:19:48.060
Which involves
growing-- not only

00:19:48.060 --> 00:19:50.280
using homeopathic
treatments-- but growing

00:19:50.280 --> 00:19:54.080
the chamomile or the
nettles, yourself.

00:19:54.080 --> 00:19:55.982
And really, in his
case, his view of this--

00:19:55.982 --> 00:19:57.690
LIV WU: Does he have
animals on the farm?

00:19:57.690 --> 00:19:58.981
JON BONNE: He has some animals.

00:19:58.981 --> 00:20:00.930
The animals are always
a little tricky,

00:20:00.930 --> 00:20:02.430
especially when you
have grapevines.

00:20:04.610 --> 00:20:10.860
So it's this
negotiation of manure.

00:20:10.860 --> 00:20:14.230
You have never met someone
who has been so revered,

00:20:14.230 --> 00:20:19.950
in the world, and who graduated
Brown, and has this Ivy League

00:20:19.950 --> 00:20:24.320
education, who's spent so much
time thinking about cow manure.

00:20:24.320 --> 00:20:27.240
And his thing is that
it's not even the grapes.

00:20:27.240 --> 00:20:29.690
He has a lot of work
with vines and with using

00:20:29.690 --> 00:20:31.344
clonal replication.

00:20:31.344 --> 00:20:33.010
So that, instead of
going to the nursery

00:20:33.010 --> 00:20:34.870
and getting what they
say you should get,

00:20:34.870 --> 00:20:36.680
that you really are
interested in coming up

00:20:36.680 --> 00:20:39.290
with a clonal diversity,
or in his case Pinot noir

00:20:39.290 --> 00:20:41.085
and Chardonnay.

00:20:41.085 --> 00:20:42.460
But more than
that, that you have

00:20:42.460 --> 00:20:45.680
to figure out a way to
sustainably farm the dirt.

00:20:45.680 --> 00:20:50.710
So that you have a biological
life in your vineyard.

00:20:50.710 --> 00:20:52.690
And that will
allow you to create

00:20:52.690 --> 00:20:54.210
wines of true distinction.

00:20:54.210 --> 00:20:58.400
So Ted ended up embodying
all of the things

00:20:58.400 --> 00:20:59.400
that the book gets into.

00:20:59.400 --> 00:21:02.080
Because a lot of it is
about farming and how

00:21:02.080 --> 00:21:04.540
the real goal of
farming, in wine, is

00:21:04.540 --> 00:21:08.730
to be able to create
these signatures of place

00:21:08.730 --> 00:21:11.540
that make a wine different
from another wine.

00:21:11.540 --> 00:21:14.490
That let you see this
vague notion of terroir,

00:21:14.490 --> 00:21:19.630
lest you understand what,
potentially, is there.

00:21:19.630 --> 00:21:21.850
And he completes the loop.

00:21:21.850 --> 00:21:26.040
Plus he did his best American
Gothic impression for us.

00:21:26.040 --> 00:21:28.625
So after 13 covers,
it became clear this

00:21:28.625 --> 00:21:31.790
was the image we really wanted.

00:21:31.790 --> 00:21:34.610
LIV WU: They're all--
well, they're not all--

00:21:34.610 --> 00:21:39.100
quite a few are small wineries
and probably not-so-easy-to-get

00:21:39.100 --> 00:21:39.600
wines.

00:21:39.600 --> 00:21:44.070
Are there producers and
growers in here that are bigger

00:21:44.070 --> 00:21:45.770
and that are more
accessible for us.

00:21:45.770 --> 00:21:46.970
JON BONNE: Sure.

00:21:46.970 --> 00:21:47.820
They vary.

00:21:47.820 --> 00:21:50.060
There are a fair
number small wineries.

00:21:50.060 --> 00:21:53.806
Only in that, as with any
innovation, you're going to,

00:21:53.806 --> 00:21:55.180
inevitably, be
looking for people

00:21:55.180 --> 00:21:56.860
who are starting to
work at small scale.

00:22:00.860 --> 00:22:02.360
But a lot of them have scaled.

00:22:02.360 --> 00:22:04.850
Ridge is a perfect
example of a wine

00:22:04.850 --> 00:22:07.790
that is still very accessible.

00:22:07.790 --> 00:22:13.010
Calera actually, as well,
Calera-- the estate bottlings

00:22:13.010 --> 00:22:14.360
are not that easy to get.

00:22:14.360 --> 00:22:18.610
But the Central Coast, which
are with purchased fruit,

00:22:18.610 --> 00:22:20.961
I think I see them
in most Safeways.

00:22:20.961 --> 00:22:22.460
LIV WU: This is
Calera in Hollister.

00:22:22.460 --> 00:22:23.970
JON BONNE: In Hollister, yeah.

00:22:23.970 --> 00:22:26.920
12 miles outside of Hollister.

00:22:26.920 --> 00:22:28.830
And who else?

00:22:28.830 --> 00:22:34.300
There's a family that I profile
in the book called the Bilbros.

00:22:34.300 --> 00:22:37.040
And they have a label
called Marietta.

00:22:37.040 --> 00:22:40.970
And Marietta, it's interesting,
is about 35 or 37 years old

00:22:40.970 --> 00:22:41.470
now.

00:22:41.470 --> 00:22:44.800
And it's now up to
75,000 cases of the wine

00:22:44.800 --> 00:22:46.960
called "Old Vine Red."

00:22:46.960 --> 00:22:52.310
And it's this classic tribute
to the old field blends,

00:22:52.310 --> 00:22:54.900
really, that the
Sonoma Italian farmers

00:22:54.900 --> 00:22:56.180
were making pre-Prohibition.

00:22:56.180 --> 00:22:58.610
And they simply wanted to
bring that back, in some cases,

00:22:58.610 --> 00:23:00.930
using the exact same vineyards.

00:23:00.930 --> 00:23:05.067
And to make, surely,
a table wine.

00:23:05.067 --> 00:23:07.150
And then, there's a whole
chapter about table wine

00:23:07.150 --> 00:23:10.410
and this very issue
of how do you scale.

00:23:10.410 --> 00:23:13.400
There's two brothers,
just for one more,

00:23:13.400 --> 00:23:16.990
Jim and Bob Varner,
who are twin brothers.

00:23:16.990 --> 00:23:21.500
They did a number of things.

00:23:21.500 --> 00:23:25.290
One of them studied biotech.

00:23:25.290 --> 00:23:30.220
One studied at Davis,
doing sensory science.

00:23:30.220 --> 00:23:32.830
But they found this
tiny little jewel

00:23:32.830 --> 00:23:36.105
of a vineyard in Portola
Valley, and make--

00:23:36.105 --> 00:23:36.730
LIV WU: Really.

00:23:36.730 --> 00:23:38.810
JON BONNE: Yeah and
right by the open space.

00:23:38.810 --> 00:23:42.310
And have for almost--
certainly over 30 years,

00:23:42.310 --> 00:23:45.920
now, really, some of the best
Chardonnays in California.

00:23:45.920 --> 00:23:49.350
But because they came up in
late '70s and early '80s,

00:23:49.350 --> 00:23:51.420
at a time when they
realized that even

00:23:51.420 --> 00:23:55.380
the great French winemakers
also made table wine.

00:23:55.380 --> 00:23:58.800
So they went farther
south on the Central Coast

00:23:58.800 --> 00:24:00.590
to look for less
expensive fruit.

00:24:00.590 --> 00:24:02.680
And they make a second
label called Foxglove

00:24:02.680 --> 00:24:06.430
that is about $14 a bottle,
$13 to $14 a bottle.

00:24:06.430 --> 00:24:09.230
And they make, all told,
with the different ones,

00:24:09.230 --> 00:24:12.460
probably about
45,000 cases of it.

00:24:12.460 --> 00:24:14.550
And in a slightly different way.

00:24:14.550 --> 00:24:16.870
It's not as meticulous.

00:24:16.870 --> 00:24:20.380
But in a notion that
you, as a good winemaker,

00:24:20.380 --> 00:24:23.320
have a responsibility to make
a wine that people can actually

00:24:23.320 --> 00:24:25.327
find and that they can afford.

00:24:25.327 --> 00:24:27.410
LIV WU: I'm going to have
you talk about the wines

00:24:27.410 --> 00:24:30.260
but we're going to
be tasting soon.

00:24:30.260 --> 00:24:32.820
And we'll tell you
where they are.

00:24:32.820 --> 00:24:36.690
But I'll just break off for
now, for the time being,

00:24:36.690 --> 00:24:38.146
to see if there
are any questions.

00:24:38.146 --> 00:24:39.770
AUDIENCE: How do you
envision this book

00:24:39.770 --> 00:24:41.159
being consumed by your readers?

00:24:41.159 --> 00:24:42.700
JON BONNE: That is,
not surprisingly,

00:24:42.700 --> 00:24:44.450
a discussion that I
had with my publisher.

00:24:46.650 --> 00:24:49.030
I think that we
want it very much

00:24:49.030 --> 00:24:52.651
to be a book that had
multiple entry points.

00:24:52.651 --> 00:24:53.150
It's funny.

00:24:53.150 --> 00:24:55.399
A lot of people do describe
it as a coffee table book.

00:24:55.399 --> 00:24:56.290
I don't think it is.

00:24:56.290 --> 00:25:01.050
But I think, because it has some
pretty pictures, maybe that's

00:25:01.050 --> 00:25:02.409
where people take it to.

00:25:02.409 --> 00:25:04.200
Certainly you can put
it on a coffee table.

00:25:04.200 --> 00:25:10.480
I have one on mine for not
particularly aesthetic reasons.

00:25:10.480 --> 00:25:13.080
But it obviously needed
to speak to people

00:25:13.080 --> 00:25:17.080
who are expert in the field,
and to be a solid reference.

00:25:17.080 --> 00:25:21.070
But I also wanted it to tell
a specific narrative story.

00:25:21.070 --> 00:25:22.880
And so the first
third of the book

00:25:22.880 --> 00:25:26.190
is thematic, in the
sense that-- some of it

00:25:26.190 --> 00:25:28.940
is talking about what we
were just talking about.

00:25:28.940 --> 00:25:33.890
What happened, what went wrong,
the evolution of history.

00:25:33.890 --> 00:25:35.100
A lot of talk about farming.

00:25:35.100 --> 00:25:38.470
A lot of talk about
grapes and varieties

00:25:38.470 --> 00:25:40.840
and this totally
arbitrary selection

00:25:40.840 --> 00:25:43.970
of the varieties that people
associate with California.

00:25:43.970 --> 00:25:46.750
When, in fact, there's many,
many other grapes that do

00:25:46.750 --> 00:25:49.790
do well, here,
and could do well.

00:25:49.790 --> 00:25:55.100
And so it's complex
stuff, but I don't

00:25:55.100 --> 00:25:57.210
think it's meant--
it's not a textbook.

00:25:57.210 --> 00:26:00.340
It's not meant to be
super, super nerdy.

00:26:00.340 --> 00:26:02.320
And the other piece--
so there's that.

00:26:02.320 --> 00:26:04.210
The second part is
what we ended up

00:26:04.210 --> 00:26:05.870
calling a "road trip,"
which is looking

00:26:05.870 --> 00:26:11.320
at the evolving geography of
California through, literally,

00:26:11.320 --> 00:26:14.859
me going out and spending
time and driving around a lot.

00:26:14.859 --> 00:26:16.400
And then the third
part is reference.

00:26:16.400 --> 00:26:19.960
And that is the part where I
think people go back and look

00:26:19.960 --> 00:26:21.475
for producers they
might know, look

00:26:21.475 --> 00:26:23.370
for producers they
don't know, and use it

00:26:23.370 --> 00:26:27.000
in some ways as a buying guide.

00:26:27.000 --> 00:26:28.770
LIV WU: The maps are great.

00:26:28.770 --> 00:26:30.470
JON BONNE: And there's maps.

00:26:30.470 --> 00:26:32.090
LIV WU: And it's
so very different

00:26:32.090 --> 00:26:35.840
than the tourism map you would
get when you drop into the Napa

00:26:35.840 --> 00:26:38.632
Valley or the Sonoma Valley or
the Central Coast or Mendocino.

00:26:38.632 --> 00:26:40.840
JON BONNE: And a complete
shameless plug, I will say.

00:26:40.840 --> 00:26:43.715
Those maps were almost entirely
developed, all the data,

00:26:43.715 --> 00:26:44.340
LIV WU: Google?

00:26:44.340 --> 00:26:44.980
JON BONNE: Google Earth.

00:26:44.980 --> 00:26:45.470
LIV WU: Oh, Thank you.

00:26:45.470 --> 00:26:46.150
Google Maps.

00:26:46.150 --> 00:26:47.090
OK.

00:26:47.090 --> 00:26:48.410
If you had said anything else.

00:26:48.410 --> 00:26:49.082
JON BONNE: No, Google Earth.

00:26:49.082 --> 00:26:49.283
LIV WU: OK.

00:26:49.283 --> 00:26:49.783
All right.

00:26:49.783 --> 00:26:53.010
JON BONNE: Yeah, and it was,
shipped off the data set

00:26:53.010 --> 00:26:56.590
and then had to
spend a lot of time

00:26:56.590 --> 00:26:58.270
negotiating with
our cartographer.

00:26:58.270 --> 00:27:00.900
AUDIENCE: So anecdotally, I
feel like, in the last 10 years,

00:27:00.900 --> 00:27:04.690
wine prices in California have
gone up quite tremendously.

00:27:04.690 --> 00:27:06.750
And the number of
producers has also

00:27:06.750 --> 00:27:10.590
increased dramatically,
particularly small producers.

00:27:10.590 --> 00:27:14.200
Do you feel like we're
in a wine bubble, per se?

00:27:14.200 --> 00:27:14.950
As people--

00:27:14.950 --> 00:27:16.575
JON BONNE: The supply
and demand curves

00:27:16.575 --> 00:27:18.290
don't quite seem to make sense?

00:27:18.290 --> 00:27:22.770
Yeah, some of it is that wine
prices almost never go down.

00:27:22.770 --> 00:27:24.800
They do when there's
a major correction.

00:27:24.800 --> 00:27:26.400
And 2008 brought a
major correction.

00:27:26.400 --> 00:27:29.640
But even then, you
could see the pain

00:27:29.640 --> 00:27:32.180
that the cult
Cabernet makers had

00:27:32.180 --> 00:27:34.650
with having to contemplate
what it would do to their brand

00:27:34.650 --> 00:27:36.070
to drop prices.

00:27:36.070 --> 00:27:37.090
And a few of them did.

00:27:37.090 --> 00:27:40.190
I'm thinking of Dominus, which
dropped its price by about $40

00:27:40.190 --> 00:27:42.820
and then promptly raised by $80.

00:27:42.820 --> 00:27:49.480
But it is probably
the biggest problem

00:27:49.480 --> 00:27:52.240
with California wine,
which is that it

00:27:52.240 --> 00:27:55.412
is very expensive to farm here.

00:27:55.412 --> 00:27:56.620
There's built-in labor costs.

00:27:56.620 --> 00:27:59.070
There's obviously
built-in land costs.

00:27:59.070 --> 00:28:02.720
If you buy new land, it
is exorbitantly expensive

00:28:02.720 --> 00:28:05.700
to first buy it and
then and then plant it.

00:28:05.700 --> 00:28:12.350
And also there's very
little discussion

00:28:12.350 --> 00:28:14.810
within the industry
of affordability.

00:28:14.810 --> 00:28:19.710
And that, to me, is really
one of the big liabilities,

00:28:19.710 --> 00:28:20.440
for California.

00:28:20.440 --> 00:28:25.430
Because I think everyone
can make an ambitious wine

00:28:25.430 --> 00:28:27.050
and wants to make
an ambitious wine.

00:28:27.050 --> 00:28:30.280
But making an affordable
wine and, what I would say

00:28:30.280 --> 00:28:34.019
is, a sustainable
business model is

00:28:34.019 --> 00:28:35.560
something people
are struggling with.

00:28:35.560 --> 00:28:41.280
And I don't know that the
number of wineries will shrink.

00:28:41.280 --> 00:28:45.110
I keep waiting for it
to, because it's amazing

00:28:45.110 --> 00:28:50.310
how tolerant people's bankers
are of a really poor cash flow.

00:28:50.310 --> 00:28:52.900
And I don't know that we
need this constant expansion,

00:28:52.900 --> 00:28:57.265
only in that I would
rather see quality come up.

00:28:57.265 --> 00:28:59.070
AUDIENCE: Does the
book only cover

00:28:59.070 --> 00:29:00.670
Napa or the whole California?

00:29:00.670 --> 00:29:03.010
JON BONNE: It covers
all of California

00:29:03.010 --> 00:29:06.390
from-- did I make
it up to Humboldt?

00:29:06.390 --> 00:29:11.650
Let's see-- northern Mendocino
down to San Diego County.

00:29:11.650 --> 00:29:14.560
And we actually do we have two
San Diego producers in there.

00:29:14.560 --> 00:29:17.136
And then also out into
the Sierra foothills.

00:29:17.136 --> 00:29:18.010
AUDIENCE: OK.

00:29:18.010 --> 00:29:21.100
And have you been to many
of those small, family-owned

00:29:21.100 --> 00:29:22.229
boutique wineries?

00:29:22.229 --> 00:29:23.520
JON BONNE: Quite a lot of them.

00:29:23.520 --> 00:29:25.394
AUDIENCE: So they're
all covered in the book?

00:29:25.394 --> 00:29:26.320
JON BONNE: Sorry?

00:29:26.320 --> 00:29:28.720
AUDIENCE: Have you also
featured them in the book?

00:29:28.720 --> 00:29:29.600
JON BONNE: Yeah.

00:29:29.600 --> 00:29:34.310
There's a 125 producers
who are in the book.

00:29:34.310 --> 00:29:36.870
I would say they're all,
ultimately, family-owned,

00:29:36.870 --> 00:29:38.340
in some way.

00:29:38.340 --> 00:29:41.470
And most of them, probably
80% to 85% of them,

00:29:41.470 --> 00:29:44.266
are making 5,000 cases or less.

00:29:44.266 --> 00:29:45.140
JON BONNE: Thank you.

00:29:45.140 --> 00:29:46.030
AUDIENCE: Hi.

00:29:46.030 --> 00:29:48.570
So you mentioned
things about additives

00:29:48.570 --> 00:29:50.970
and what they're putting
back in the wine.

00:29:50.970 --> 00:29:56.260
And so what, if anything, is
the role of modern chemistry

00:29:56.260 --> 00:29:59.870
and science in new
California wine?

00:29:59.870 --> 00:30:02.070
JON BONNE: So Ridge is
actually a good example.

00:30:02.070 --> 00:30:04.380
Because Ridge had a guy
named Leo McCloskey,

00:30:04.380 --> 00:30:06.620
who has become the
poster child for what

00:30:06.620 --> 00:30:10.220
I will call "interventionism"
in the cellar.

00:30:10.220 --> 00:30:13.460
He worked there as an intern,
actually, in the '70s,

00:30:13.460 --> 00:30:16.610
before he went on to become a
pretty famous wine consultant.

00:30:16.610 --> 00:30:20.040
He's the guy who
created software

00:30:20.040 --> 00:30:28.360
based around gas chromatography
that, he asserts, can predict,

00:30:28.360 --> 00:30:31.590
to the exact number, what Robert
Parker and the Wine Spectator

00:30:31.590 --> 00:30:33.740
will give a wine.

00:30:33.740 --> 00:30:36.700
I hate to think of being
that predictable as a critic,

00:30:36.700 --> 00:30:38.670
but so it is.

00:30:38.670 --> 00:30:41.510
So one of the things that
that created at Ridge

00:30:41.510 --> 00:30:44.830
was a legacy where
the lab serves

00:30:44.830 --> 00:30:48.510
as your canary, so to speak.

00:30:48.510 --> 00:30:50.700
It shows you when
things are going right.

00:30:50.700 --> 00:30:53.680
It shows you if there's
really a microbial issue,

00:30:53.680 --> 00:30:56.920
a chemical issue that
needs to be dealt with.

00:30:56.920 --> 00:31:00.080
It gives you a constant
set of feedback.

00:31:00.080 --> 00:31:03.510
But then the other side
of Ridge is this very--

00:31:03.510 --> 00:31:06.350
I don't want to say rudimentary,
but this very minimalist view

00:31:06.350 --> 00:31:07.040
of winemaking.

00:31:07.040 --> 00:31:11.920
Where they really do believe
that, in general, properly

00:31:11.920 --> 00:31:16.212
farmed grapes can go through
spontaneous fermentations.

00:31:16.212 --> 00:31:18.670
That the various yeast strains
that you need to take a wine

00:31:18.670 --> 00:31:21.470
all the way through
should fundamentally

00:31:21.470 --> 00:31:23.470
be available to you.

00:31:23.470 --> 00:31:27.460
That's not a universal
but it's certainly,

00:31:27.460 --> 00:31:31.230
I think, a good
belief to have, rather

00:31:31.230 --> 00:31:34.206
than believing you have
to inevitably start out

00:31:34.206 --> 00:31:36.270
with a commercial yeast.

00:31:36.270 --> 00:31:41.055
They try not to do
acid adjustments.

00:31:41.055 --> 00:31:41.930
They do a little bit.

00:31:41.930 --> 00:31:43.050
They do add a
little bit of water.

00:31:43.050 --> 00:31:45.510
A lot of people add water,
which is technically illegal.

00:31:45.510 --> 00:31:52.120
But is just a very
weak acidification.

00:31:56.595 --> 00:31:57.970
It's interesting,
because I think

00:31:57.970 --> 00:32:00.440
there are people who
believe that you absolutely

00:32:00.440 --> 00:32:02.500
can't do anything.

00:32:02.500 --> 00:32:05.680
And that is difficult,
because there are just times

00:32:05.680 --> 00:32:08.020
when things don't go right.

00:32:08.020 --> 00:32:10.770
Even for people who would
choose to not do more

00:32:10.770 --> 00:32:13.002
than an absolute bare minimum.

00:32:13.002 --> 00:32:14.460
But the thing to
always remember is

00:32:14.460 --> 00:32:16.580
that each step
that someone takes

00:32:16.580 --> 00:32:23.950
beyond 19th century winemaking
inevitably pulls the wine away.

00:32:23.950 --> 00:32:26.410
And especially when you're
starting to adjust chemistry,

00:32:26.410 --> 00:32:28.290
pulls the wine away
from what it would

00:32:28.290 --> 00:32:32.680
taste like if it were grown
to peak ripeness, where it was

00:32:32.680 --> 00:32:36.500
grown, and pulled off
at this balance point.

00:32:36.500 --> 00:32:39.610
And it's not something to
even pick on California about,

00:32:39.610 --> 00:32:42.230
necessarily, because the
French have been adding sugar

00:32:42.230 --> 00:32:47.020
to their wines, and
still do, for 150 years,

00:32:47.020 --> 00:32:51.110
in order to bring up the
minimum alcohol level.

00:32:51.110 --> 00:32:54.770
So they have some
issues to deal with,

00:32:54.770 --> 00:32:58.940
as do a lot of
new world regions.

00:32:58.940 --> 00:33:02.000
But I think the thing for me
that I always try to remember

00:33:02.000 --> 00:33:04.030
is where we are with
viticulture, now,

00:33:04.030 --> 00:33:07.540
with grape growing, is
so exponentially farther

00:33:07.540 --> 00:33:09.870
than we were 30 years ago.

00:33:09.870 --> 00:33:12.370
That things are not
always going to go right,

00:33:12.370 --> 00:33:16.490
but there is a lot more
knowledge in figuring out

00:33:16.490 --> 00:33:19.370
how to hit peak
ripeness, naturally.

00:33:19.370 --> 00:33:22.570
That people who are
deliberately pushing beyond that

00:33:22.570 --> 00:33:26.860
because they feel
that that's how

00:33:26.860 --> 00:33:29.287
they'd rather
construct their wine.

00:33:29.287 --> 00:33:30.370
That, to me, is a problem.

00:33:30.370 --> 00:33:32.210
Because it's also
those folks usually

00:33:32.210 --> 00:33:34.930
want about $150
to $200 a bottle.

00:33:34.930 --> 00:33:36.004
LIV WU: The raisin wines.

00:33:36.004 --> 00:33:37.170
JON BONNE: The raisin wines.

00:33:37.170 --> 00:33:39.339
And one of the things
that I asserted--

00:33:39.339 --> 00:33:41.630
this is something that came
up the first time, I think,

00:33:41.630 --> 00:33:45.550
last year when we were at
Charleston-- is a lot of,

00:33:45.550 --> 00:33:48.654
not just the book, but a lot of
California wines are expensive.

00:33:48.654 --> 00:33:50.070
And certainly when
you're starting

00:33:50.070 --> 00:33:54.970
to pay $45, $50, $80, $100,
$200 a bottle for a product,

00:33:54.970 --> 00:33:57.490
I want someone who has
done their job right.

00:33:57.490 --> 00:34:01.000
And when people are
either correcting things

00:34:01.000 --> 00:34:03.650
they did wrong, or
are deliberately

00:34:03.650 --> 00:34:07.780
making bad decisions
about farming so that they

00:34:07.780 --> 00:34:12.389
can go and fix it later, then
I'm paying someone to have,

00:34:12.389 --> 00:34:14.872
essentially, done
their job badly.

00:34:14.872 --> 00:34:17.080
AUDIENCE: This might be
rather obvious, but as a wine

00:34:17.080 --> 00:34:20.900
critic what do you
see as your role?

00:34:20.900 --> 00:34:21.856
LIV WU: Good question.

00:34:23.962 --> 00:34:25.420
JON BONNE: That is
a good question.

00:34:29.250 --> 00:34:34.219
I think my role is to do
what any critic does, which

00:34:34.219 --> 00:34:39.570
is to find what there is of
quality and highlight it.

00:34:39.570 --> 00:34:44.620
To find what is under-performing
and take issue with it.

00:34:44.620 --> 00:34:47.949
I don't get to do quite as much
of that as I would like to.

00:34:47.949 --> 00:34:51.917
But, commercial
realities of newspapers.

00:34:51.917 --> 00:34:53.500
But I think, more
than anything, to be

00:34:53.500 --> 00:34:57.040
able to step back and talk
about themes and trends

00:34:57.040 --> 00:34:59.250
and what's happening and
where things are going.

00:34:59.250 --> 00:35:03.580
And to see where the edge is
and to see where avant garde is.

00:35:03.580 --> 00:35:07.800
And not to simply
hand out scores.

00:35:07.800 --> 00:35:10.590
Because I think wine,
for whatever reason,

00:35:10.590 --> 00:35:14.050
has fallen into this place where
people expect that a critic's

00:35:14.050 --> 00:35:18.560
job is to just hold up a
number at the end of things.

00:35:18.560 --> 00:35:21.600
And that's given birth to a
lot of critics who, I think,

00:35:21.600 --> 00:35:26.180
don't step back and look
for greater perspective.

00:35:26.180 --> 00:35:29.810
And look at whether a
style of wine or styles

00:35:29.810 --> 00:35:33.960
of wine or regions are emerging
and getting interesting.

00:35:33.960 --> 00:35:39.220
Or perhaps are living a
little too high on the hog

00:35:39.220 --> 00:35:41.710
or are overextending themselves.

00:35:41.710 --> 00:35:45.845
So I think my view
of how you are

00:35:45.845 --> 00:35:47.720
being a wine critic is
probably a little more

00:35:47.720 --> 00:35:52.956
aggressive than some
of my fellow critics.

00:35:52.956 --> 00:35:54.330
But the other
thing-- and I think

00:35:54.330 --> 00:35:56.538
it's important that I've
been talking about it more--

00:35:56.538 --> 00:36:01.890
is that there's this somewhat
flawed notion in wine

00:36:01.890 --> 00:36:03.880
criticism and food
criticism, as well,

00:36:03.880 --> 00:36:06.890
that you can stand
back and be objective.

00:36:06.890 --> 00:36:10.930
And that you could hand down
from on high this score that

00:36:10.930 --> 00:36:13.760
will absolutely represent
the quality of wine,

00:36:13.760 --> 00:36:16.470
of a restaurant, what have
you, which is ludicrous.

00:36:16.470 --> 00:36:18.950
In my case, I can
bring my experience.

00:36:18.950 --> 00:36:26.690
I can bring what I see are
successful iterations of a wine

00:36:26.690 --> 00:36:28.890
or of a region.

00:36:28.890 --> 00:36:33.260
But ultimately, I came
to this realization

00:36:33.260 --> 00:36:35.660
that I had own my biases.

00:36:35.660 --> 00:36:39.280
And I would sort of hope
that, in the next few years,

00:36:39.280 --> 00:36:41.270
that I see more wine
critics doing the same.

00:36:41.270 --> 00:36:43.770
Because there are
a handful of folks

00:36:43.770 --> 00:36:47.380
who I'm thinking of who
very clearly have biases,

00:36:47.380 --> 00:36:48.159
which is fine.

00:36:48.159 --> 00:36:49.950
They've done [INAUDIBLE]
very well by them.

00:36:49.950 --> 00:36:53.750
But they do stand behind
this veil of objectivity

00:36:53.750 --> 00:36:57.830
and pretend as though what
they're doing is gospel.

00:36:57.830 --> 00:37:00.500
And that, I have a
huge problem with.

00:37:00.500 --> 00:37:02.670
LIV WU: That leads
me to a question.

00:37:02.670 --> 00:37:10.600
So food critics, were all being
undone by yelpers and others.

00:37:10.600 --> 00:37:13.333
It's not happening as
heavily in wine, is it?

00:37:13.333 --> 00:37:15.770
JON BONNE: It's
happening a fair amount.

00:37:15.770 --> 00:37:21.560
Not that there was ever a great,
sustainable career as a wine--

00:37:21.560 --> 00:37:25.310
basically, I have one of the
two unicorn jobs in the country.

00:37:25.310 --> 00:37:27.350
And Eric Asimov, at
the Times is the other.

00:37:27.350 --> 00:37:34.430
And so we enjoy our good luck.

00:37:34.430 --> 00:37:37.070
But I think, going
forward, what's

00:37:37.070 --> 00:37:40.791
going to-- and to the point
about what a critic's role is--

00:37:40.791 --> 00:37:43.040
what's going to happen, and
probably in food, as well,

00:37:43.040 --> 00:37:46.130
is that anyone can
hand out four stars

00:37:46.130 --> 00:37:49.930
and say that the
fries were soggy.

00:37:49.930 --> 00:37:51.140
But to actually--

00:37:51.140 --> 00:37:52.882
LIV WU: Two stars.

00:37:52.882 --> 00:37:53.590
JON BONNE: Sorry.

00:37:53.590 --> 00:37:54.480
Four stars on Yelp!

00:37:58.730 --> 00:38:02.080
To actually step back and
look at themes and patterns,

00:38:02.080 --> 00:38:04.060
and to see what's
happening, and to be

00:38:04.060 --> 00:38:09.770
able to place restaurants, but
also chefs, trends, cities,

00:38:09.770 --> 00:38:11.970
into context, it's
still something

00:38:11.970 --> 00:38:15.480
that really does require
professional skill.

00:38:15.480 --> 00:38:18.190
And, honestly, a lot of
writers don't have that skill.

00:38:18.190 --> 00:38:20.375
So the way I just started
describing it with wine

00:38:20.375 --> 00:38:21.750
is that I think
where we're going

00:38:21.750 --> 00:38:24.010
to evolve to is something
a little bit more

00:38:24.010 --> 00:38:26.140
like a Pro-Am model.

00:38:26.140 --> 00:38:31.190
Where there's no reason
not to have input

00:38:31.190 --> 00:38:33.340
from people who are
tasting the wines.

00:38:33.340 --> 00:38:35.560
Because-- I don't know
if anyone's encountered--

00:38:35.560 --> 00:38:37.490
there's a website
called "Cellar Tracker"

00:38:37.490 --> 00:38:41.630
which, it's technical
issues aside,

00:38:41.630 --> 00:38:43.380
is actually a very,
very good database

00:38:43.380 --> 00:38:46.610
of consumer and pro
reviews of wines.

00:38:46.610 --> 00:38:48.850
And it's astonishing
to me how often

00:38:48.850 --> 00:38:54.190
the median of the
consumer reviews

00:38:54.190 --> 00:38:57.700
comes to where
professional reviews land.

00:38:57.700 --> 00:39:00.700
So my takeaway from that
is that when you get people

00:39:00.700 --> 00:39:03.300
who are interested in the wines
and who are interested enough

00:39:03.300 --> 00:39:07.510
to actually want to go and
share their views of them,

00:39:07.510 --> 00:39:11.780
you get a pretty
accurate view of quality.

00:39:11.780 --> 00:39:13.587
And there's no reason
not to have that

00:39:13.587 --> 00:39:15.170
and not to appreciate
that same thing.

00:39:15.170 --> 00:39:17.270
There's a technology
called "Delectable"

00:39:17.270 --> 00:39:20.930
that's doing something similar,
although it's all iPhone-based.

00:39:20.930 --> 00:39:24.885
I've nagged them
incessantly that-- they

00:39:24.885 --> 00:39:27.010
said they had trouble
finding an Android developer.

00:39:27.010 --> 00:39:27.510
I--

00:39:30.610 --> 00:39:32.880
But same thing.

00:39:32.880 --> 00:39:34.972
It's sort of Facebook
for wine, basically.

00:39:34.972 --> 00:39:38.307
It lets you see what everyone
you know is drinking.

00:39:38.307 --> 00:39:39.890
And the great thing
with it is that it

00:39:39.890 --> 00:39:41.810
has optical recognition,
so all you have to do

00:39:41.810 --> 00:39:43.060
is take a picture of a bottle.

00:39:43.060 --> 00:39:45.200
And within 10 or 15
minutes it will tell you,

00:39:45.200 --> 00:39:47.764
with about 99% accuracy,
what you're drinking.

00:39:50.326 --> 00:39:52.700
So there's these models that
are out there that, I think,

00:39:52.700 --> 00:39:55.560
are very effective for doing a
lot of what criticism has done

00:39:55.560 --> 00:39:58.820
in the past, which is just
throw numbers out on something.

00:39:58.820 --> 00:40:00.520
Which for me, gives
me the latitude

00:40:00.520 --> 00:40:02.840
to go and do things
like write books.

00:40:02.840 --> 00:40:04.950
AUDIENCE: What if there's
no water in California?

00:40:04.950 --> 00:40:07.490
JON BONNE: Really good question.

00:40:07.490 --> 00:40:11.320
Water gets a good bit of
discussion in the book.

00:40:11.320 --> 00:40:14.390
The thing with grapevines
that most winemakers don't

00:40:14.390 --> 00:40:17.060
want to admit is that
they're basically weeds.

00:40:17.060 --> 00:40:19.530
They're not really hard to grow.

00:40:19.530 --> 00:40:22.140
When you look at crops that
are actually difficult to grow,

00:40:22.140 --> 00:40:25.100
vines are extraordinarily
easy to grow.

00:40:25.100 --> 00:40:28.790
And they actually don't
require a lot of water.

00:40:28.790 --> 00:40:32.020
They're a drought-tolerant crop
when they're farmed correctly.

00:40:32.020 --> 00:40:34.090
The problem is that,
mostly after the advent

00:40:34.090 --> 00:40:37.030
of drip irrigation, which
was better, admittedly,

00:40:37.030 --> 00:40:43.050
than furrow and
sprinkler irrigation,

00:40:43.050 --> 00:40:44.920
viticulturists in
California came

00:40:44.920 --> 00:40:47.230
to believe that they had to
water their vines in a very

00:40:47.230 --> 00:40:48.690
regular pattern.

00:40:48.690 --> 00:40:52.070
So the first thing
is you see vineyards

00:40:52.070 --> 00:40:55.620
that have been established as
dry-farmed tend to be much more

00:40:55.620 --> 00:40:59.140
drought-tolerant, because
they've developed deeper root

00:40:59.140 --> 00:41:00.820
systems.

00:41:00.820 --> 00:41:03.210
There's not as much
variability based

00:41:03.210 --> 00:41:05.820
on seasonal weather
patterns and rainfall.

00:41:05.820 --> 00:41:07.340
But also there's
a company that I

00:41:07.340 --> 00:41:09.381
talk about in the book,
called Fruition Sciences.

00:41:09.381 --> 00:41:13.820
And these are guys who came up
with a very good model of using

00:41:13.820 --> 00:41:18.680
various sensor probes to
measure the potential water

00:41:18.680 --> 00:41:20.500
access of vineyards.

00:41:20.500 --> 00:41:25.300
And their assertion is that
even vineyards that are using,

00:41:25.300 --> 00:41:27.400
relatively, water could
probably drop their water

00:41:27.400 --> 00:41:30.750
usage by 80% to 90%,
and still farm well.

00:41:30.750 --> 00:41:33.690
So I think that the
folks who are either

00:41:33.690 --> 00:41:37.970
deciding that they're going to
take the time to let vineyards

00:41:37.970 --> 00:41:40.540
establish themselves
without added water,

00:41:40.540 --> 00:41:43.090
or the folks who are
really willing to use

00:41:43.090 --> 00:41:45.610
the technology that's
available to them

00:41:45.610 --> 00:41:48.260
to drop their water use,
they're going to be fine.

00:41:48.260 --> 00:41:51.010
The folks who want to
keep using standard drip

00:41:51.010 --> 00:41:52.740
so that they can
bump their yields up

00:41:52.740 --> 00:41:56.470
and they keep, essentially,
overcharging people for wine,

00:41:56.470 --> 00:41:59.160
they are going to face a
rather significant crisis

00:41:59.160 --> 00:42:00.609
is this keeps going.

00:42:00.609 --> 00:42:02.400
AUDIENCE: There's a
current trend right now

00:42:02.400 --> 00:42:06.889
about pairing Cabernet
Francs with Szechuan cuisine.

00:42:06.889 --> 00:42:08.930
I just want to know what
your opinion is on that.

00:42:08.930 --> 00:42:11.410
JON BONNE: I love it.

00:42:11.410 --> 00:42:17.540
I've taken-- well,
you know Old Mandarin.

00:42:17.540 --> 00:42:20.300
It's not, specifically, that
Szechuan's more Beijing-style.

00:42:20.300 --> 00:42:24.270
But there's a restaurant
in the Outer Sunset,

00:42:24.270 --> 00:42:27.990
near me, that uses a fair
amount of those flavors.

00:42:27.990 --> 00:42:30.150
And I bring some
form of Cabernet-

00:42:30.150 --> 00:42:32.400
based Franc wine--
Cabernet Franc-based wine,

00:42:32.400 --> 00:42:34.597
everywhere I can,
or every time I can.

00:42:34.597 --> 00:42:36.680
Some of it is that it is
one of the few wines that

00:42:36.680 --> 00:42:39.330
has both the aromatics
and also, what I'll

00:42:39.330 --> 00:42:44.480
say, sort of the capsicum-like
aspects, in its, aromas.

00:42:44.480 --> 00:42:46.850
As well as this
very bright fruit,

00:42:46.850 --> 00:42:53.130
that actually goes with the
range of Szechuan flavors.

00:42:53.130 --> 00:42:56.360
So you've just
revealed my secret.

00:42:58.586 --> 00:42:59.960
LIV WU: It's in
print, somewhere.

00:42:59.960 --> 00:43:01.150
JON BONNE: Yeah.

00:43:01.150 --> 00:43:04.610
LIV WU: So if you have
no more questions,

00:43:04.610 --> 00:43:07.764
I'm going to have you
describe the three

00:43:07.764 --> 00:43:09.055
wines that we have for tasting.

00:43:09.055 --> 00:43:09.721
JON BONNE: Sure.

00:43:09.721 --> 00:43:12.310
LIV WU: And then
we'll pour some wine.

00:43:12.310 --> 00:43:16.620
And then you can ask John more
questions while you're sipping.

00:43:16.620 --> 00:43:18.659
So talk about the
Chenin Blanc, first?

00:43:18.659 --> 00:43:19.950
JON BONNE: Yeah, it's in order.

00:43:19.950 --> 00:43:20.991
LIV WU: It'll be in here?

00:43:20.991 --> 00:43:21.870
Is it in there?

00:43:21.870 --> 00:43:22.590
Yes.

00:43:22.590 --> 00:43:24.420
JON BONNE: The Chenin Blanc.

00:43:24.420 --> 00:43:28.370
So we actually have two wines
from the same wine maker

00:43:28.370 --> 00:43:33.170
and then one from
another duo of guys.

00:43:33.170 --> 00:43:35.780
So the Chenin Blanc is the
Leo Steen Chenin Blanc.

00:43:35.780 --> 00:43:38.910
It's made by a guy named Leo
Hansen, who's actually Danish.

00:43:38.910 --> 00:43:41.770
Was a sommelier, a very famous
sommelier in Copenhagen.

00:43:41.770 --> 00:43:46.320
And wanted to make wine,
so he came to California.

00:43:46.320 --> 00:43:48.530
Makes wine actually for
a vineyard in Sonoma

00:43:48.530 --> 00:43:49.840
called Stuhlmuller.

00:43:49.840 --> 00:43:52.530
But also has his own
label called Leo Steen.

00:43:52.530 --> 00:43:54.220
Steen is his middle name.

00:43:54.220 --> 00:43:56.880
Steen is also the South African
name, the historical South

00:43:56.880 --> 00:43:58.670
African name, for
Chenin Blanc, which

00:43:58.670 --> 00:44:01.510
is the other place in the
world where it grows well.

00:44:01.510 --> 00:44:05.740
And this is his Chenin Blanc.

00:44:05.740 --> 00:44:09.520
It's from Dry Creek Valley,
from a vineyard called Saini,

00:44:09.520 --> 00:44:14.660
S-A-I-N-I. About 30-year-old
vines, dry farmed.

00:44:14.660 --> 00:44:17.970
And in fact, I think
all of the wines, today,

00:44:17.970 --> 00:44:19.800
are from dry-farmed vineyards.

00:44:19.800 --> 00:44:22.350
In fact, from dry-farmed
organic vineyards.

00:44:22.350 --> 00:44:24.270
So about 30 years old.

00:44:24.270 --> 00:44:27.705
Kind of a parcel that the farmer
forgot or was selling off.

00:44:27.705 --> 00:44:31.350
Because Chenin Blanc used to
be a very significant grape

00:44:31.350 --> 00:44:33.430
in California in
the '70s and '80s.

00:44:33.430 --> 00:44:37.850
And then got this reputation
for being kind of trashy and not

00:44:37.850 --> 00:44:40.450
that interesting.

00:44:40.450 --> 00:44:41.850
And people stopped drinking it.

00:44:41.850 --> 00:44:44.821
And so Leo and a
handful of other folks

00:44:44.821 --> 00:44:46.320
have started to
bring it back really

00:44:46.320 --> 00:44:50.720
as this great, sort of
aromatic, slightly spicy

00:44:50.720 --> 00:44:54.710
table wine, that is great.

00:44:54.710 --> 00:44:56.520
I don't tend to age
this wine very long,

00:44:56.520 --> 00:45:00.880
but I have friends who
do age it and insist,

00:45:00.880 --> 00:45:03.726
among other things, that
the 2006 bottling of this

00:45:03.726 --> 00:45:05.600
is one of the best Chenin
Blancs they've had.

00:45:05.600 --> 00:45:07.780
And this is someone, by the way,
who makes, what I would argue,

00:45:07.780 --> 00:45:09.650
is the best Chenin
Blanc in California.

00:45:09.650 --> 00:45:13.990
So if he thinks Leo is beating
him, I'll give him that.

00:45:13.990 --> 00:45:16.940
LIV WU: And it's $16, $17?

00:45:16.940 --> 00:45:17.860
How much is that?

00:45:17.860 --> 00:45:20.950
JON BONNE: About
that. $17, yeah.

00:45:20.950 --> 00:45:24.430
Directly behind you-- and
I'm going in the order

00:45:24.430 --> 00:45:26.680
that I would
probably taste them--

00:45:26.680 --> 00:45:37.290
is the-- there we go-- the
Birichino 2012 Sinsault.

00:45:37.290 --> 00:45:39.920
So Birichino is a project
from two guys, John Locke

00:45:39.920 --> 00:45:41.695
and Alex Kraus.

00:45:41.695 --> 00:45:43.820
Both of them worked for
Randal Graham at Bonny Doon

00:45:43.820 --> 00:45:45.840
and survived.

00:45:45.840 --> 00:45:48.950
And John actually
still runs a wine shop

00:45:48.950 --> 00:45:52.130
in Santa Cruz called "Swap."

00:45:52.130 --> 00:45:54.720
So they make wine
together under this label.

00:45:54.720 --> 00:45:57.689
And this is from one of
my favorite vineyards

00:45:57.689 --> 00:45:58.230
in the state.

00:45:58.230 --> 00:46:00.980
It's from a vineyard
called Bechthold,

00:46:00.980 --> 00:46:03.860
which is in western Lodi.

00:46:03.860 --> 00:46:08.430
And it was planted
in 1886 to Sinsault,

00:46:08.430 --> 00:46:11.830
which is a not terribly
noteworthy grape

00:46:11.830 --> 00:46:14.170
from southern France.

00:46:14.170 --> 00:46:18.810
And somehow Bechthold has become
the darling of all California.

00:46:18.810 --> 00:46:22.390
Everyone wants to get into
Bechthold and make Sinsault.

00:46:22.390 --> 00:46:25.680
Turley, actually, was the
first big name to get in there

00:46:25.680 --> 00:46:27.810
and make this very
Beaujolais style.

00:46:27.810 --> 00:46:29.210
They now are in there.

00:46:29.210 --> 00:46:34.640
Randall used to use
it for Cigare Volante.

00:46:34.640 --> 00:46:38.770
And a handful of other folks,
Scholium Project, et cetera.

00:46:38.770 --> 00:46:42.740
Like I said, it's sort of
organically farmed, by neglect.

00:46:42.740 --> 00:46:44.650
Nobody ever bothered
to put chemicals on it.

00:46:44.650 --> 00:46:48.825
So and again, sort of
sandy soils, dry-farmed.

00:46:48.825 --> 00:46:50.700
And it's this completely
improbable vineyard.

00:46:50.700 --> 00:46:54.400
No one's entirely sure how
it survived, because nobody

00:46:54.400 --> 00:46:56.130
made any money in
Lodi selling grapes.

00:46:56.130 --> 00:46:58.840
And certainly not
low-yielding grapes--

00:46:58.840 --> 00:47:02.770
from low--yielding dry-farmed
vines that were getting,

00:47:02.770 --> 00:47:05.850
I don't know, $400 a ton and
are now getting like, maybe,

00:47:05.850 --> 00:47:07.840
three times that.

00:47:07.840 --> 00:47:12.040
So to me, this is this
quintessence one of, really,

00:47:12.040 --> 00:47:14.891
the longitivity of
California, and how,

00:47:14.891 --> 00:47:16.390
for all of the
newness, there really

00:47:16.390 --> 00:47:19.430
is a great lineage
back to the past.

00:47:19.430 --> 00:47:22.850
And to these grapes that were
once really important, here,

00:47:22.850 --> 00:47:26.940
before market forces dictated
that Cabernet and Chardonnay

00:47:26.940 --> 00:47:29.410
would take over.

00:47:29.410 --> 00:47:32.980
And it's just pretty,
it's fragrant.

00:47:32.980 --> 00:47:34.800
It is-- to your
point, before-- it

00:47:34.800 --> 00:47:37.870
is a wine that I think would
go with quite a lot of food,

00:47:37.870 --> 00:47:39.710
because it's subtle.

00:47:39.710 --> 00:47:42.110
The tannins are very, very soft.

00:47:42.110 --> 00:47:45.110
It's not a tannic grape.

00:47:45.110 --> 00:47:46.690
And I think, more
than anything, it

00:47:46.690 --> 00:47:50.380
preserves this really
significant vineyard

00:47:50.380 --> 00:47:55.060
that is very much a
historical artifact.

00:47:55.060 --> 00:47:59.630
On similar lines, right around
the corner, back to Leo,

00:47:59.630 --> 00:48:04.110
is the-- here we go--
the Leo Steen Calpella.

00:48:04.110 --> 00:48:05.834
And this is--
unfortunately, I think

00:48:05.834 --> 00:48:07.750
he's going to move on
to a different vineyard.

00:48:07.750 --> 00:48:10.940
But so he also wanted
to make a red wine.

00:48:10.940 --> 00:48:14.070
Oh, and the Bechtold
is, I think, $19.

00:48:14.070 --> 00:48:16.110
$19 or $20.

00:48:16.110 --> 00:48:20.540
And so the Leo Steen Calpella
is a blend going back, again,

00:48:20.540 --> 00:48:23.730
to historically important
grapes in California.

00:48:23.730 --> 00:48:28.200
It's a blend of Carignan
and Petit Syrah.

00:48:28.200 --> 00:48:30.550
The vineyard's about
60, 65 years old.

00:48:30.550 --> 00:48:31.950
It's called the Testa Vineyard.

00:48:31.950 --> 00:48:34.750
It's in Calpella, which
is a tiny little hamlet

00:48:34.750 --> 00:48:38.680
in Mendocino, right off the 101.

00:48:38.680 --> 00:48:41.100
And again, this is
one of those vineyards

00:48:41.100 --> 00:48:42.780
that just survived by neglect.

00:48:42.780 --> 00:48:45.880
It's dry-farmed,
organically farmed.

00:48:45.880 --> 00:48:47.957
Again, just old
Mendocino farming family,

00:48:47.957 --> 00:48:49.540
didn't really know
what to do with it.

00:48:49.540 --> 00:48:51.860
But didn't want to take
it out, so they've now

00:48:51.860 --> 00:48:55.550
found buyers who are interested
in paying them fair market

00:48:55.550 --> 00:48:57.300
value.

00:48:57.300 --> 00:48:59.340
So Carignan was the
great workhorse grape

00:48:59.340 --> 00:49:02.450
of the late 19th and
early 20th century.

00:49:02.450 --> 00:49:05.980
Planted all over a very big
part of the old field blends.

00:49:05.980 --> 00:49:07.360
Can make an
interesting wine when

00:49:07.360 --> 00:49:10.040
it's from old vines,
which this is.

00:49:10.040 --> 00:49:12.790
Got again a reputation
for being sort of lowly

00:49:12.790 --> 00:49:17.110
and uninteresting, which it can
be, if it's not farmed well.

00:49:17.110 --> 00:49:22.230
But makes this very savory,
spicy, complex wine.

00:49:22.230 --> 00:49:24.860
There's usually kind of a
celery seed component to it.

00:49:24.860 --> 00:49:27.290
Petit Syrah being the
other piece of the blending

00:49:27.290 --> 00:49:29.230
component, historically.

00:49:29.230 --> 00:49:29.950
Used for color.

00:49:29.950 --> 00:49:31.840
Used for tannin.

00:49:31.840 --> 00:49:33.740
Very tannic, very kind of blue.

00:49:33.740 --> 00:49:36.245
It's like blueberries
and sandpaper.

00:49:39.170 --> 00:49:41.500
It's not a huge
component in here.

00:49:41.500 --> 00:49:44.930
I think this is a very
appropriate use of it.

00:49:44.930 --> 00:49:47.430
But again, this notion, this
is obviously more structured.

00:49:47.430 --> 00:49:51.160
But if you think about what
a really good, somewhat

00:49:51.160 --> 00:49:53.550
savory table wine
should be, I think

00:49:53.550 --> 00:49:56.080
this is a perfect,
perfect example.

00:49:56.080 --> 00:50:00.250
And again, it's $18, maybe.

00:50:00.250 --> 00:50:00.900
LIV WU: Great.

00:50:00.900 --> 00:50:02.850
So look forward to tasting it.

00:50:02.850 --> 00:50:04.490
Thank you so much.

00:50:04.490 --> 00:50:06.040
And.
