[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:00:06.140 --> 00:00:08.394
SPEAKER: Well, welcome everyone.

00:00:08.394 --> 00:00:09.560
Thanks for joining us today.

00:00:09.560 --> 00:00:12.320
We're excited to
host Bishop Robert

00:00:12.320 --> 00:00:16.920
Barron for this talk at Google
as part of a series of talks,

00:00:16.920 --> 00:00:21.030
the Catholic community here
arranged not only for itself,

00:00:21.030 --> 00:00:24.230
but also for other religious
or non-religious groups

00:00:24.230 --> 00:00:26.990
that we also warmly welcome.

00:00:26.990 --> 00:00:30.170
Bishop Barron just flew in
this morning, all the way

00:00:30.170 --> 00:00:32.750
from LA, to share a
message that we believe

00:00:32.750 --> 00:00:34.430
to be very aligned
with our core values

00:00:34.430 --> 00:00:37.910
here at Google, especially in
regards to respectful dialogue

00:00:37.910 --> 00:00:41.660
and respecting each other
and each other's dignity.

00:00:41.660 --> 00:00:43.760
Who is Bishop Robert
Barron, though?

00:00:43.760 --> 00:00:47.370
MELISSA: I'm glad you
asked, [? Davo. ?]

00:00:47.370 --> 00:00:49.760
Bishop Robert Barron
is the Auxiliary

00:00:49.760 --> 00:00:52.490
Bishop of the Archdiocese
of Los Angeles.

00:00:52.490 --> 00:00:55.580
And he's the founder of Word
on Fire Catholic Ministries.

00:00:55.580 --> 00:00:59.000
His website,
wordonfire.org, reaches

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:00.900
millions of people each year.

00:01:00.900 --> 00:01:03.180
And he's one of the world's
most followed Catholics

00:01:03.180 --> 00:01:06.200
on social media, along
with Pope Francis.

00:01:06.200 --> 00:01:08.570
And his regular YouTube
videos have been

00:01:08.570 --> 00:01:11.090
viewed over 25 million times.

00:01:11.090 --> 00:01:14.420
And he recently received the
YouTube Silver Creator Award.

00:01:14.420 --> 00:01:16.100
Woo!

00:01:16.100 --> 00:01:20.060
So Bishop Barron is a number one
bestselling author on Amazon.

00:01:20.060 --> 00:01:23.450
And he's published numerous
books, essays, and articles

00:01:23.450 --> 00:01:26.240
on theology and
the spiritual life.

00:01:26.240 --> 00:01:28.820
We have a few copies
of his latest book,

00:01:28.820 --> 00:01:32.300
"To Light a Fire on the Earth,"
in the back to give away today.

00:01:32.300 --> 00:01:34.730
Please don't all rush
over there right now.

00:01:34.730 --> 00:01:38.030
There will be time after
the talk for a book signing

00:01:38.030 --> 00:01:39.893
and also Q&amp;A again.

00:01:39.893 --> 00:01:40.820
SPEAKER: Yeah.

00:01:40.820 --> 00:01:43.973
So without further ado,
let's welcome Bishop Barron.

00:01:43.973 --> 00:01:46.070
[APPLAUSE]

00:01:46.070 --> 00:01:47.736
ROBERT BARRON: Thank
you guys very much.

00:01:47.736 --> 00:01:48.236
Thanks.

00:01:52.067 --> 00:01:53.150
Well, thank you very much.

00:01:53.150 --> 00:01:54.566
Thanks for that
nice introduction.

00:01:54.566 --> 00:01:57.309
And it really is a
delight to be here at--

00:01:57.309 --> 00:01:59.600
I mean, you all know this--
one of the most significant

00:01:59.600 --> 00:02:01.640
cultural centers,
really, in the world.

00:02:01.640 --> 00:02:03.290
I've been very warmly received.

00:02:03.290 --> 00:02:04.640
So thanks for the invitation.

00:02:04.640 --> 00:02:09.530
Thanks for the
great hospitality.

00:02:09.530 --> 00:02:15.590
I want to talk about religion
and the opening up of the mind.

00:02:15.590 --> 00:02:18.950
Because very often,
religion gets a bad rap.

00:02:18.950 --> 00:02:20.060
It's superstitious.

00:02:20.060 --> 00:02:21.140
It's subrational.

00:02:21.140 --> 00:02:22.730
It's opposed to the mind.

00:02:22.730 --> 00:02:25.520
I'm going to argue,
au contraire--

00:02:25.520 --> 00:02:27.080
just the contrary--
that religion,

00:02:27.080 --> 00:02:30.620
authentically construed,
is meant to open up

00:02:30.620 --> 00:02:32.070
the mind and the will.

00:02:32.070 --> 00:02:32.570
OK?

00:02:32.570 --> 00:02:36.230
That's my goal today.

00:02:36.230 --> 00:02:38.150
A term that now
is common parlance

00:02:38.150 --> 00:02:41.642
but didn't exist when I was
a young man is search engine.

00:02:41.642 --> 00:02:43.100
And here we are at
the headquarters

00:02:43.100 --> 00:02:47.810
of the most popular and powerful
search engine on the planet.

00:02:47.810 --> 00:02:49.730
At our fingertips
now, quite literally,

00:02:49.730 --> 00:02:52.881
is almost all the knowledge,
all the wisdom, information,

00:02:52.881 --> 00:02:54.380
that the human race
has accumulated.

00:02:54.380 --> 00:02:58.040
And we can just press a
button, and up it comes.

00:02:58.040 --> 00:03:00.800
Just recently, I was with
an older friend of mine,

00:03:00.800 --> 00:03:05.810
and he was mentioning
the 1937 World Series.

00:03:05.810 --> 00:03:07.407
And he was convinced
that game three

00:03:07.407 --> 00:03:09.740
ended with a certain score,
but wasn't sure what it was.

00:03:09.740 --> 00:03:11.340
And I said, well,
let's check Mr. Google.

00:03:11.340 --> 00:03:12.215
So of course, we did.

00:03:12.215 --> 00:03:15.920
And up came the information
about game three of the 1937

00:03:15.920 --> 00:03:16.709
World Series.

00:03:16.709 --> 00:03:18.500
Not that long ago, I
was with someone else,

00:03:18.500 --> 00:03:21.020
and we were wondering about
a passage in "The Divine

00:03:21.020 --> 00:03:22.010
Comedy" of Dante.

00:03:22.010 --> 00:03:24.721
And of course we were able
to find it very quickly.

00:03:24.721 --> 00:03:25.220
Here's one.

00:03:25.220 --> 00:03:27.178
Now, there's maybe a few
in the room old enough

00:03:27.178 --> 00:03:28.750
to remember the show "F Troop."

00:03:28.750 --> 00:03:29.999
Remember that from the '60s?

00:03:29.999 --> 00:03:31.790
[LAUGHS] Well, I see
I've got a few of you.

00:03:31.790 --> 00:03:34.901
I was with some
friends from my era,

00:03:34.901 --> 00:03:37.150
and we were arguing about
the characters in "F Troop."

00:03:37.150 --> 00:03:38.630
I said, well, let's
ask Mr. Google.

00:03:38.630 --> 00:03:41.202
So up came the
characters on "F Troop."

00:03:41.202 --> 00:03:41.910
So you know that.

00:03:41.910 --> 00:03:45.380
That we have, really, at this
extraordinary civilizational

00:03:45.380 --> 00:03:50.300
moment, the capacity to
access the wisdom of the race.

00:03:50.300 --> 00:03:54.140
Now, see, search
engine, search engine,

00:03:54.140 --> 00:03:58.590
triggers for me an awful lot
of resonances with religion.

00:03:58.590 --> 00:04:00.470
How come?

00:04:00.470 --> 00:04:05.780
The mind, by an inner
instinct, is restless,

00:04:05.780 --> 00:04:07.400
even relentlessly so.

00:04:07.400 --> 00:04:08.060
Right?

00:04:08.060 --> 00:04:10.850
The mind searches for truth.

00:04:10.850 --> 00:04:11.570
And it finds it.

00:04:11.570 --> 00:04:14.300
Finds the particular truth,
like the ones I just mentioned.

00:04:14.300 --> 00:04:16.610
But does the mind ever
rest at that point?

00:04:16.610 --> 00:04:17.720
No, no, no.

00:04:17.720 --> 00:04:20.450
The minute we find
some truth, usually

00:04:20.450 --> 00:04:22.820
12 more questions emerge.

00:04:22.820 --> 00:04:24.540
Think of the way we
all surf the web.

00:04:24.540 --> 00:04:27.040
We go looking for something,
but it leads us somewhere else,

00:04:27.040 --> 00:04:28.940
then somewhere else,
somewhere else again.

00:04:28.940 --> 00:04:30.920
And then we find all
this so fascinating,

00:04:30.920 --> 00:04:33.020
we forget what we were
originally looking for.

00:04:33.020 --> 00:04:36.710
The mind is restless,
even relentlessly so.

00:04:36.710 --> 00:04:38.030
It never rests.

00:04:38.030 --> 00:04:41.462
Or if it does, it's
the way a climber might

00:04:41.462 --> 00:04:42.920
rest on the side
of a mountain just

00:04:42.920 --> 00:04:46.770
to catch his breath
before heading back up.

00:04:46.770 --> 00:04:47.650
It searches.

00:04:47.650 --> 00:04:49.070
It searches.

00:04:49.070 --> 00:04:53.258
The more it knows, the
more it wants to know.

00:04:53.258 --> 00:04:56.300
My great intellectual hero
is St. Thomas Aquinas.

00:04:56.300 --> 00:05:01.610
And he spoke in the 13th
century of the [LATIN]..

00:05:01.610 --> 00:05:02.740
That's his Latin.

00:05:02.740 --> 00:05:04.760
And usually it's
transliterated into English

00:05:04.760 --> 00:05:08.720
as the agent intellect,
which sounds rather cold.

00:05:08.720 --> 00:05:12.080
See, [LATIN],, in
Latin, is a participle.

00:05:12.080 --> 00:05:15.830
Doing, making, moving.

00:05:15.830 --> 00:05:19.115
[LATIN] is the restless,
searching mind.

00:05:21.770 --> 00:05:24.740
Now, where is it
going, the [LATIN]??

00:05:24.740 --> 00:05:26.240
What's it looking for?

00:05:26.240 --> 00:05:30.230
Here I love the one-liner from
the great Jesuit philosopher,

00:05:30.230 --> 00:05:31.910
Bernard Lonergan.

00:05:31.910 --> 00:05:33.620
Lonergan says, it's very simple.

00:05:33.620 --> 00:05:38.060
The mind wants to know
everything about everything.

00:05:38.060 --> 00:05:41.300
Now, Google, this should
be familiar to you, right?

00:05:41.300 --> 00:05:43.490
But that's the natural
dynamism of the mind.

00:05:43.490 --> 00:05:48.710
Not to know just this particular
truth or that, not just

00:05:48.710 --> 00:05:51.650
the conglomeration of
all particular truths.

00:05:51.650 --> 00:05:54.170
The mind wants to know
everything about everything.

00:05:54.170 --> 00:05:57.450
It wants not just
particular truths,

00:05:57.450 --> 00:06:01.310
it wants the truth itself.

00:06:01.310 --> 00:06:04.520
It wants the source
of reality itself.

00:06:04.520 --> 00:06:07.840
That's how hungry the mind is.

00:06:07.840 --> 00:06:10.520
Another Lonergan line
is there's an emptiness

00:06:10.520 --> 00:06:12.860
like the emptiness of a box.

00:06:12.860 --> 00:06:16.050
It's kind of a dumb emptiness,
just waiting to be filled.

00:06:16.050 --> 00:06:18.630
But there's also the
emptiness of the stomach.

00:06:18.630 --> 00:06:21.410
It's empty, but it
knows what it wants.

00:06:21.410 --> 00:06:23.690
The mind is empty at
the beginning of life,

00:06:23.690 --> 00:06:26.180
but not like a box,
more like a stomach.

00:06:26.180 --> 00:06:30.950
[LATIN],, searching,
searching, until it

00:06:30.950 --> 00:06:35.690
comes to its fulfillment,
only in knowing everything

00:06:35.690 --> 00:06:37.190
about everything.

00:06:37.190 --> 00:06:40.220
The very source of reality.

00:06:40.220 --> 00:06:41.300
OK?

00:06:41.300 --> 00:06:47.480
True of the mind,
equally true of the will.

00:06:47.480 --> 00:06:50.720
The second great dynamic of
the human spirit, the will.

00:06:50.720 --> 00:06:55.600
Now, the will seeks not
the true, but the good.

00:06:55.600 --> 00:06:57.130
So right now,
everyone in this room,

00:06:57.130 --> 00:06:59.480
we're all seeking
the good in some way.

00:06:59.480 --> 00:07:02.050
So I'm seeking the good
of speaking to you.

00:07:02.050 --> 00:07:07.090
You're seeking-- I hope you
find it-- some good in my talk.

00:07:07.090 --> 00:07:09.275
We talk about final causality.

00:07:09.275 --> 00:07:10.900
Aristotle made that
distinction, right?

00:07:10.900 --> 00:07:14.740
Between efficient causality,
it's like a pushing cause.

00:07:14.740 --> 00:07:16.630
Think of all the
physical sciences.

00:07:16.630 --> 00:07:19.700
The modern sciences are based
upon efficient causality,

00:07:19.700 --> 00:07:22.840
where did things come from,
what brings them into being.

00:07:22.840 --> 00:07:25.945
But final causality, Aristotle
thought was more important.

00:07:25.945 --> 00:07:31.490
That's the pulling cause, what
attracts or lures things Now,

00:07:31.490 --> 00:07:32.740
that's a talk for another day.

00:07:32.740 --> 00:07:36.020
We could debate final
causality in nature,

00:07:36.020 --> 00:07:40.150
but I think no one would
disagree that final causality

00:07:40.150 --> 00:07:43.780
obtains, in our world,
that we human beings are

00:07:43.780 --> 00:07:45.710
drawn by the good.

00:07:45.710 --> 00:07:49.080
It lures our wills.

00:07:49.080 --> 00:07:50.200
OK.

00:07:50.200 --> 00:07:53.980
But remember the [LATIN],,
the restless, seeking, never

00:07:53.980 --> 00:07:55.390
satisfied mind.

00:07:55.390 --> 00:07:58.690
The same is true of the will.

00:07:58.690 --> 00:08:01.510
Notice how any act
of the will can

00:08:01.510 --> 00:08:03.660
be analyzed in a kind
of Russian doll manner.

00:08:03.660 --> 00:08:04.660
Do you know what I mean?

00:08:04.660 --> 00:08:06.140
The one doll inside the other?

00:08:06.140 --> 00:08:09.880
That every particular act of
the will, if we think about it,

00:08:09.880 --> 00:08:14.800
is situated in a broader and
wider act of the will, which

00:08:14.800 --> 00:08:18.520
in turn is in a broader and
wider, broader and wider,

00:08:18.520 --> 00:08:20.080
et cetera.

00:08:20.080 --> 00:08:21.820
And what am I talking about?

00:08:21.820 --> 00:08:24.630
Think about getting out
of bed in the morning.

00:08:24.630 --> 00:08:27.072
So it's an act of the will
unless you fell out of bed.

00:08:27.072 --> 00:08:28.780
But if you get out of
bed the normal way,

00:08:28.780 --> 00:08:29.890
it's an act of the will.

00:08:29.890 --> 00:08:33.130
You're seeking a good
to start your day.

00:08:33.130 --> 00:08:37.299
But see, that good
nests in a higher good.

00:08:37.299 --> 00:08:39.039
Why do you get out of bed?

00:08:39.039 --> 00:08:40.820
Well, I want to get to work.

00:08:40.820 --> 00:08:42.190
OK.

00:08:42.190 --> 00:08:44.049
Why do you want to get to work?

00:08:44.049 --> 00:08:46.150
Well, I need to make money.

00:08:46.150 --> 00:08:48.290
Well, why do you
need to make money?

00:08:48.290 --> 00:08:51.104
Well, I want to support
myself and my family.

00:08:51.104 --> 00:08:53.270
Why do you want to support
yourself and your family?

00:08:53.270 --> 00:08:56.200
Well, supporting my family
leads to their flourishing.

00:08:56.200 --> 00:08:57.580
Well, why do you want that?

00:08:57.580 --> 00:09:03.660
Because my family
flourishing makes me happy.

00:09:03.660 --> 00:09:06.920
And I want to be
happy all the time

00:09:06.920 --> 00:09:10.790
and in an unconditioned way.

00:09:10.790 --> 00:09:13.820
Just as the mind won't rest
until it knows everything

00:09:13.820 --> 00:09:16.010
about everything,
so the will doesn't

00:09:16.010 --> 00:09:21.950
rest until it finds an
unconditioned happiness.

00:09:21.950 --> 00:09:24.800
Now, analyze any act
of the will that way.

00:09:24.800 --> 00:09:26.450
I sent my car to the mechanic.

00:09:26.450 --> 00:09:27.070
How come?

00:09:27.070 --> 00:09:28.456
So the car will run better.

00:09:28.456 --> 00:09:29.580
Well, why do you want that?

00:09:29.580 --> 00:09:31.970
So I can get to work,
and now do that analysis.

00:09:31.970 --> 00:09:34.049
Or so I can get to my
friends more easily.

00:09:34.049 --> 00:09:35.090
But why do you want that?

00:09:35.090 --> 00:09:38.520
Well, being with my friends is a
great good that makes me happy.

00:09:38.520 --> 00:09:40.820
And I want to be
happy all the time

00:09:40.820 --> 00:09:43.880
and in an unconditioned way.

00:09:43.880 --> 00:09:45.009
I go to a basketball game.

00:09:45.009 --> 00:09:46.425
This is kind of
easier to analyze.

00:09:46.425 --> 00:09:47.630
Well, why do you want that?

00:09:47.630 --> 00:09:50.000
Well, because basketball is
interesting and beautiful,

00:09:50.000 --> 00:09:51.840
and contemplating
it makes me happy.

00:09:51.840 --> 00:09:54.560
And I want to be
happy all the time

00:09:54.560 --> 00:09:56.580
and in an unconditioned way.

00:09:56.580 --> 00:10:00.770
See, the will, if we
analyze it sufficiently,

00:10:00.770 --> 00:10:07.400
is conditioned by a
desire for [LATIN]..

00:10:07.400 --> 00:10:09.410
I'm using this Latin
term on purpose,

00:10:09.410 --> 00:10:12.440
because it was
Thomas Aquinas' term.

00:10:12.440 --> 00:10:12.980
Happiness.

00:10:12.980 --> 00:10:14.840
[LATIN] means happy in Latin.

00:10:14.840 --> 00:10:18.690
[LATIN] is the happiness
I'm talking about,

00:10:18.690 --> 00:10:21.271
which is not the happiness that
comes from a particular act

00:10:21.271 --> 00:10:21.770
of the will.

00:10:21.770 --> 00:10:23.754
Like, hey, I went to hear
Bishop Barron's talk.

00:10:23.754 --> 00:10:24.420
Yeah, it was OK.

00:10:24.420 --> 00:10:25.280
I liked it.

00:10:25.280 --> 00:10:27.750
It made me happy in
a very limited way.

00:10:27.750 --> 00:10:28.520
OK.

00:10:28.520 --> 00:10:30.830
I'll be happy if that's true.

00:10:30.830 --> 00:10:34.190
But then analyze any
act, including this one,

00:10:34.190 --> 00:10:38.390
and you'll eventually
get to the desire

00:10:38.390 --> 00:10:42.590
at the ground of the
will for [LATIN],,

00:10:42.590 --> 00:10:46.130
unconditioned happiness.

00:10:46.130 --> 00:10:48.530
Now, here's an interesting
thing, everybody.

00:10:48.530 --> 00:10:52.910
Prior to modernity, prior
to the rise of the sciences,

00:10:52.910 --> 00:10:56.180
the principal question
that preoccupied

00:10:56.180 --> 00:10:59.000
the minds of the best and
brightest people in the West

00:10:59.000 --> 00:11:01.840
was the nature of [LATIN].

00:11:01.840 --> 00:11:03.140
What is it?

00:11:03.140 --> 00:11:04.640
So we all want it.

00:11:04.640 --> 00:11:07.460
And that's true, by the way,
of the religious believer,

00:11:07.460 --> 00:11:08.900
of the agnostic, the atheist.

00:11:08.900 --> 00:11:12.300
Everybody wants [LATIN].

00:11:12.300 --> 00:11:15.560
It's the first
mover of the will.

00:11:15.560 --> 00:11:17.890
So what is it?

00:11:17.890 --> 00:11:20.960
And can I submit to you, there
is no question more important

00:11:20.960 --> 00:11:22.165
than that.

00:11:22.165 --> 00:11:24.290
And see, one of the tragedies,
I think, of our time

00:11:24.290 --> 00:11:26.660
is so often we
bracket that question.

00:11:26.660 --> 00:11:29.510
Because we're so preoccupied
with the achievements

00:11:29.510 --> 00:11:31.199
of our sciences,
and God bless them.

00:11:31.199 --> 00:11:32.240
I'm all in favor of them.

00:11:32.240 --> 00:11:33.470
Don't get me wrong.

00:11:33.470 --> 00:11:35.590
But we tend to
bracket the question

00:11:35.590 --> 00:11:38.120
that prior to modernity,
the best and brightest

00:11:38.120 --> 00:11:41.870
people thought was
the most important.

00:11:41.870 --> 00:11:46.550
What is this [LATIN] that all
of us, at least implicitly,

00:11:46.550 --> 00:11:48.500
are seeking?

00:11:48.500 --> 00:11:49.060
OK?

00:11:49.060 --> 00:11:52.250
And I want to give you a little
bit now of Thomas Aquinas'

00:11:52.250 --> 00:11:53.780
analysis of this.

00:11:53.780 --> 00:11:56.150
You can find it, by the
way, in the very beginning

00:11:56.150 --> 00:11:59.840
of the second part of his
great "Summa Theologica,"

00:11:59.840 --> 00:12:02.380
his summary of theology.

00:12:02.380 --> 00:12:03.710
You know, it's interesting.

00:12:03.710 --> 00:12:07.370
Many years ago, there was a
prominent Catholic cardinal

00:12:07.370 --> 00:12:09.080
who had a little quip
that he often used.

00:12:09.080 --> 00:12:12.680
He said, good morality
is like good art.

00:12:12.680 --> 00:12:15.300
It begins with the
drawing of a line.

00:12:15.300 --> 00:12:19.190
Now, it's a clever line, but
I think, actually, it's wrong.

00:12:19.190 --> 00:12:22.690
Because that's not the
way Aquinas starts.

00:12:22.690 --> 00:12:24.860
The drawing of a
line, like a law.

00:12:24.860 --> 00:12:25.899
I am in favor of it.

00:12:25.899 --> 00:12:26.690
Don't get me wrong.

00:12:26.690 --> 00:12:29.360
We have to get to
some drawing of lines.

00:12:29.360 --> 00:12:31.220
But Aquinas begins
not with the law,

00:12:31.220 --> 00:12:33.800
that happens in question 90.

00:12:33.800 --> 00:12:35.090
Nine-zero.

00:12:35.090 --> 00:12:37.580
Question one, question
one, and here he's

00:12:37.580 --> 00:12:41.300
just like all his
premodern colleagues.

00:12:41.300 --> 00:12:45.200
Question one, what is [LATIN]?

00:12:45.200 --> 00:12:51.380
What is the happiness
that is luring our wills?

00:12:51.380 --> 00:12:55.370
So he does a kind of
process of elimination.

00:12:55.370 --> 00:13:00.110
He looks at four
classical candidates,

00:13:00.110 --> 00:13:02.590
what great people have said
and thought about the nature

00:13:02.590 --> 00:13:04.940
of [LATIN].

00:13:04.940 --> 00:13:10.910
So first he says, some people
claim that wealth is [LATIN]..

00:13:13.840 --> 00:13:15.320
To be rich, sufficiently.

00:13:15.320 --> 00:13:18.890
To be sufficiently
wealthy, that's the [LATIN]

00:13:18.890 --> 00:13:21.050
that finally I'm seeking.

00:13:21.050 --> 00:13:22.820
Now, is it a
legitimate position?

00:13:22.820 --> 00:13:24.770
Well, in a way,
I mean, I get it.

00:13:24.770 --> 00:13:27.440
Lots of very smart
people have said that.

00:13:27.440 --> 00:13:29.400
And may I submit,
in our culture,

00:13:29.400 --> 00:13:32.150
especially, you can find
an awful lot of people,

00:13:32.150 --> 00:13:34.610
I think, that hold to that.

00:13:34.610 --> 00:13:38.240
If I just have enough
money in the bank,

00:13:38.240 --> 00:13:40.920
I have a big enough
house, nice enough cars,

00:13:40.920 --> 00:13:44.727
I have a commodious
life, I'll be happy.

00:13:44.727 --> 00:13:47.060
And that's, in fact, what I'm
always implicitly desiring

00:13:47.060 --> 00:13:48.350
in all my acts of the will.

00:13:50.980 --> 00:13:52.170
True?

00:13:52.170 --> 00:13:55.180
Aquinas says, no.

00:13:55.180 --> 00:13:59.890
Wealth is good, but it can't
be the unconditioned good.

00:13:59.890 --> 00:14:00.780
How come?

00:14:00.780 --> 00:14:04.120
Well, he says, look,
what does wealth mean?

00:14:04.120 --> 00:14:05.766
He says, wealth, in
the natural sense,

00:14:05.766 --> 00:14:08.140
means-- and let me give--
there's a quote here that makes

00:14:08.140 --> 00:14:09.850
it sound kind of contemporary.

00:14:09.850 --> 00:14:18.310
He says, "Wealth serves as
a remedy for our natural

00:14:18.310 --> 00:14:23.440
wants, such as food, drink,
clothing, cars, dwellings,

00:14:23.440 --> 00:14:24.629
and such like."

00:14:24.629 --> 00:14:26.920
That's from the 13th century,
but it sounds like today,

00:14:26.920 --> 00:14:27.420
doesn't it?

00:14:27.420 --> 00:14:29.410
I mean, what is wealth?

00:14:29.410 --> 00:14:31.900
It's a remedy for natural wants.

00:14:31.900 --> 00:14:34.800
So these natural wants, like
I'm hungry, I'm thirsty,

00:14:34.800 --> 00:14:36.100
I'm uncomfortable.

00:14:36.100 --> 00:14:38.980
And so wealth gives me
food, drink, clothing, cars,

00:14:38.980 --> 00:14:41.050
dwellings, and such like.

00:14:41.050 --> 00:14:42.150
Goods?

00:14:42.150 --> 00:14:42.790
Yeah.

00:14:42.790 --> 00:14:44.360
But it can't be
the ultimate good.

00:14:44.360 --> 00:14:44.860
Why?

00:14:44.860 --> 00:14:45.670
Why?

00:14:45.670 --> 00:14:48.550
Because Thomas
says, those things

00:14:48.550 --> 00:14:50.980
are the condition
for the possibility

00:14:50.980 --> 00:14:53.037
of much higher goods.

00:14:53.037 --> 00:14:54.370
And think about it for a second.

00:14:54.370 --> 00:14:58.180
Once you've discovered-- you've
found enough food and drink,

00:14:58.180 --> 00:15:02.230
you've got a shelter, you're
living in a comfortable,

00:15:02.230 --> 00:15:07.780
commodious way, then you
can aspire to philosophy

00:15:07.780 --> 00:15:11.860
and science and friendship
and conversation--

00:15:11.860 --> 00:15:14.380
these higher goods.

00:15:14.380 --> 00:15:16.190
Wealth is a proximate good.

00:15:16.190 --> 00:15:19.510
It can't be, therefore,
the ultimate good.

00:15:19.510 --> 00:15:23.950
So that can't be [LATIN],, what
we're all implicitly seeking.

00:15:23.950 --> 00:15:24.670
OK?

00:15:24.670 --> 00:15:30.735
Others have said [LATIN],,
happiness, consists in honors.

00:15:30.735 --> 00:15:32.110
Now, think about
it for a second.

00:15:32.110 --> 00:15:35.410
How many societies, both East
and West, around the world,

00:15:35.410 --> 00:15:37.960
trans-historically,
how many societies

00:15:37.960 --> 00:15:42.880
are predicated upon
honor and shame.

00:15:42.880 --> 00:15:46.720
And the worst thing you can
experience is to be shamed.

00:15:46.720 --> 00:15:49.570
And therefore,
concomitantly, the best thing

00:15:49.570 --> 00:15:51.370
is to be honored.

00:15:51.370 --> 00:15:55.120
And I know lots of people whose
lives are pretty much centered

00:15:55.120 --> 00:15:57.880
around the quest for honor--

00:15:57.880 --> 00:16:02.410
to be thought highly of, to be
given titles and prerogatives,

00:16:02.410 --> 00:16:03.340
to be held up.

00:16:05.980 --> 00:16:06.670
OK.

00:16:06.670 --> 00:16:08.635
Is honor, though, [LATIN]?

00:16:08.635 --> 00:16:12.820
And Aquinas says,
no it can't be.

00:16:12.820 --> 00:16:13.810
Why?

00:16:13.810 --> 00:16:17.590
Because honor, he
says, is like a flag

00:16:17.590 --> 00:16:21.970
that we put on something
good, noble, and virtuous.

00:16:21.970 --> 00:16:24.460
So you notice someone
who's got great ability,

00:16:24.460 --> 00:16:27.340
or they're leading
a virtuous life,

00:16:27.340 --> 00:16:29.470
and you want to put a
flag on that to say,

00:16:29.470 --> 00:16:31.420
hey everybody, look at that.

00:16:31.420 --> 00:16:33.700
That's worth emulating.

00:16:33.700 --> 00:16:34.360
That's honor.

00:16:34.360 --> 00:16:37.810
So think of titles and positions
and prerogatives and so on.

00:16:37.810 --> 00:16:39.420
Signs of respect.

00:16:39.420 --> 00:16:42.870
They are flags of
virtue or nobility,

00:16:42.870 --> 00:16:44.860
therefore they are derivative.

00:16:44.860 --> 00:16:46.750
They're secondary.

00:16:46.750 --> 00:16:48.430
What matters much
more than honor

00:16:48.430 --> 00:16:50.110
are the things that
are being honored,

00:16:50.110 --> 00:16:53.150
namely your virtue and
nobility and so on.

00:16:53.150 --> 00:16:56.470
Therefore, honor,
good things, sure.

00:16:56.470 --> 00:16:58.870
But it can't be [LATIN].

00:16:58.870 --> 00:17:02.560
It can't be the happiness that
deep down we're all seeking.

00:17:06.099 --> 00:17:08.589
Here's another
indication that honor

00:17:08.589 --> 00:17:10.670
can't be the ultimate good.

00:17:10.670 --> 00:17:13.150
Notice Aquinas says,
who in your society

00:17:13.150 --> 00:17:15.790
is being honored the most?

00:17:15.790 --> 00:17:18.380
Are they the very best people?

00:17:18.380 --> 00:17:20.440
The question answers
itself, doesn't it?

00:17:20.440 --> 00:17:22.810
Age to age, think of the
people who get the most

00:17:22.810 --> 00:17:25.240
attention, the most adulation.

00:17:25.240 --> 00:17:26.980
Are they, in fact, the best?

00:17:26.980 --> 00:17:28.060
Again, answers itself.

00:17:30.740 --> 00:17:34.680
Others have said, you
know what [LATIN] is?

00:17:34.680 --> 00:17:37.311
It's power.

00:17:37.311 --> 00:17:37.810
Power.

00:17:37.810 --> 00:17:41.440
And again, this has a lot
of weight across the ages.

00:17:41.440 --> 00:17:45.130
Lots of impressive, important
people have argued for this.

00:17:45.130 --> 00:17:49.750
And deep down, there are a
lot of people, age after age,

00:17:49.750 --> 00:17:53.590
who do indeed seek power
as their ultimate good.

00:17:53.590 --> 00:17:56.680
You know, go back to the Tolkien
movies and the great Tolkien

00:17:56.680 --> 00:17:57.550
novels.

00:17:57.550 --> 00:18:01.630
What's the Ring but a
ring of power, right?

00:18:01.630 --> 00:18:02.710
What are they seeking?

00:18:02.710 --> 00:18:04.570
What's everybody drawn to?

00:18:04.570 --> 00:18:06.760
Talk about final
causality, right?

00:18:06.760 --> 00:18:08.740
The minute the Ring
gets near anybody.

00:18:08.740 --> 00:18:11.230
Well, it's the Ring of Power.

00:18:11.230 --> 00:18:15.280
It is, indeed, something
that we all seek.

00:18:15.280 --> 00:18:18.610
I think in our culture,
too, I would correlate power

00:18:18.610 --> 00:18:20.770
and freedom very strongly.

00:18:20.770 --> 00:18:22.630
You know, for Americans
or many Westerners,

00:18:22.630 --> 00:18:26.240
what's the supreme
value but freedom?

00:18:26.240 --> 00:18:29.260
Well, what's freedom
but power, right?

00:18:29.260 --> 00:18:30.310
Don't tread on me.

00:18:30.310 --> 00:18:31.270
Don't get in my way.

00:18:31.270 --> 00:18:33.920
Let me do what I want to
do, go where I want to go,

00:18:33.920 --> 00:18:35.950
accomplish what I
want to accomplish.

00:18:35.950 --> 00:18:38.170
And isn't it true
that we hate it when

00:18:38.170 --> 00:18:39.960
people take away our freedom?

00:18:39.960 --> 00:18:40.460
I do.

00:18:40.460 --> 00:18:41.532
I hate it.

00:18:41.532 --> 00:18:43.990
Whether that's in a physical
sense, or psychological sense,

00:18:43.990 --> 00:18:45.550
a spiritual sense.

00:18:45.550 --> 00:18:49.930
And so, OK, power does seem
to be something very alluring.

00:18:49.930 --> 00:18:53.030
Notice too, please, so
keep Tolkien in mind,

00:18:53.030 --> 00:18:55.450
but also keep in
mind, in the gospels,

00:18:55.450 --> 00:18:58.500
the great story of the
temptation of Jesus.

00:18:58.500 --> 00:19:00.370
What's the highest temptation?

00:19:00.370 --> 00:19:02.830
The third temptation?

00:19:02.830 --> 00:19:04.330
The devil takes
him to a high place

00:19:04.330 --> 00:19:06.610
and shows him what all
the kingdoms of the world

00:19:06.610 --> 00:19:07.720
in one glance.

00:19:07.720 --> 00:19:10.090
And all these I
will give you if you

00:19:10.090 --> 00:19:12.252
but bow down and worship me.

00:19:12.252 --> 00:19:15.850
It's a temptation
to power, isn't it?

00:19:15.850 --> 00:19:17.800
So it is alluring.

00:19:17.800 --> 00:19:21.000
But is it [LATIN]?

00:19:21.000 --> 00:19:22.120
Aquinas says, no.

00:19:22.120 --> 00:19:23.290
It can't be.

00:19:23.290 --> 00:19:24.370
Why?

00:19:24.370 --> 00:19:25.870
Very simple reason.

00:19:25.870 --> 00:19:30.310
Power, he says, is
a source of activity

00:19:30.310 --> 00:19:33.370
that allows us to attain an end.

00:19:33.370 --> 00:19:35.530
But [LATIN] is an end.

00:19:35.530 --> 00:19:37.090
You see what he means.

00:19:37.090 --> 00:19:39.880
Whatever this [LATIN] is, it's
something that I'm going for,

00:19:39.880 --> 00:19:40.540
that I want.

00:19:40.540 --> 00:19:42.010
It's a good that's out there.

00:19:42.010 --> 00:19:45.710
Power is terrific as a
means of attaining ends.

00:19:45.710 --> 00:19:46.210
Right?

00:19:46.210 --> 00:19:48.910
You give me the power
to do this, the power

00:19:48.910 --> 00:19:51.040
to do that, the power to attain.

00:19:51.040 --> 00:19:53.620
But power in itself
is not what you want.

00:19:53.620 --> 00:19:57.700
It's the good that power
gives you access to.

00:19:57.700 --> 00:20:02.720
Therefore, power can't
in itself be [LATIN]..

00:20:02.720 --> 00:20:06.970
OK, so it's not wealth,
not honor, not power.

00:20:06.970 --> 00:20:09.000
Here's the fourth
great candidate.

00:20:09.000 --> 00:20:11.125
And I think everybody, from
a spiritual standpoint,

00:20:11.125 --> 00:20:13.540
this is a really
helpful analysis.

00:20:13.540 --> 00:20:17.654
Because all of us, we're all
sinners in this room, I trust.

00:20:17.654 --> 00:20:20.380
[LAUGHTER]

00:20:20.380 --> 00:20:22.510
We're all beguiled by
these things in some way.

00:20:22.510 --> 00:20:25.840
We all tend to mistake
these for [LATIN]..

00:20:25.840 --> 00:20:30.040
So the fourth one,
Thomas says, is pleasure.

00:20:30.040 --> 00:20:32.350
Now, this is a very old
philosophical position.

00:20:32.350 --> 00:20:33.680
It's called hedonism.

00:20:33.680 --> 00:20:36.620
And don't make fun of
hedonism as just eat, drink,

00:20:36.620 --> 00:20:37.390
and be merry.

00:20:37.390 --> 00:20:40.530
Hedonism is a very
noble classical position

00:20:40.530 --> 00:20:43.609
that says what we all seek
deep down is pleasure.

00:20:43.609 --> 00:20:45.400
Now, it could be pleasure
in food and drink

00:20:45.400 --> 00:20:49.420
and so on, but also pleasure in
the arts, pleasure in sports,

00:20:49.420 --> 00:20:51.970
pleasure in
knowledge, et cetera.

00:20:51.970 --> 00:20:56.260
So it can be a more
refined form of hedonism.

00:20:56.260 --> 00:21:01.390
But then pleasure, it seems,
is this ultimate good.

00:21:01.390 --> 00:21:05.098
It seems to be [LATIN].

00:21:05.098 --> 00:21:08.080
Yeah, it might seem that way,
says Aquinas, but it can't be.

00:21:08.080 --> 00:21:09.550
How come?

00:21:09.550 --> 00:21:13.330
Because pleasure, he
says, is a side effect

00:21:13.330 --> 00:21:15.940
of something much
more fundamental.

00:21:15.940 --> 00:21:18.580
So when I achieve some
physical well-being,

00:21:18.580 --> 00:21:22.240
I experience pleasure
as a happy side effect,

00:21:22.240 --> 00:21:25.510
but it's the health of the
body that's really substantive.

00:21:25.510 --> 00:21:28.240
Or when I make some great
spiritual, intellectual,

00:21:28.240 --> 00:21:31.390
cultural attainment, I might
feel a rush of pleasure

00:21:31.390 --> 00:21:33.160
accompanying that,
but the pleasure

00:21:33.160 --> 00:21:35.710
is just derivative,
isn't it, from

00:21:35.710 --> 00:21:38.920
the substantive accomplishment.

00:21:38.920 --> 00:21:42.471
So pleasure can't be it.

00:21:42.471 --> 00:21:42.970
OK.

00:21:42.970 --> 00:21:44.560
So where we now?

00:21:44.560 --> 00:21:46.854
We all want [LATIN].

00:21:46.854 --> 00:21:47.770
Everyone in this room.

00:21:47.770 --> 00:21:49.960
Again, this is religious,
non-religious, believer,

00:21:49.960 --> 00:21:50.500
atheist.

00:21:50.500 --> 00:21:52.180
Everybody wants [LATIN].

00:21:52.180 --> 00:21:55.430
Otherwise, you would not get
out of bed in the morning.

00:21:55.430 --> 00:21:56.120
So what is it?

00:21:56.120 --> 00:21:57.814
What is it?

00:21:57.814 --> 00:21:58.480
It's not wealth.

00:21:58.480 --> 00:21:59.351
It's not power.

00:21:59.351 --> 00:22:00.100
It's not pleasure.

00:22:00.100 --> 00:22:00.970
It's not honor.

00:22:03.650 --> 00:22:09.560
Thomas says, the desire
for happiness, for [LATIN],,

00:22:09.560 --> 00:22:12.230
is an infinite desire.

00:22:12.230 --> 00:22:14.720
Remember I said, we want
to be happy all the time

00:22:14.720 --> 00:22:17.090
and in an unconditioned
way, don't we?

00:22:17.090 --> 00:22:19.490
I don't want to [INAUDIBLE]
over some proximate good,

00:22:19.490 --> 00:22:21.290
some limited, mitigated good.

00:22:21.290 --> 00:22:23.820
I want goodness itself.

00:22:23.820 --> 00:22:28.460
And therefore, he concludes,
[LATIN] cannot be any good

00:22:28.460 --> 00:22:32.780
in this world, of wealth,
pleasure, power, honor,

00:22:32.780 --> 00:22:34.670
or anything else.

00:22:34.670 --> 00:22:39.770
None of that can satisfy
this longing of the soul

00:22:39.770 --> 00:22:43.230
and of the heart, this questing,
this searching for [LATIN]..

00:22:45.800 --> 00:22:49.730
It is only in God.

00:22:49.730 --> 00:22:51.440
Listen to his quote.

00:22:51.440 --> 00:22:55.640
"Hence, it is evident that
nothing can lull a person's

00:22:55.640 --> 00:23:00.230
will, save the universal good.

00:23:00.230 --> 00:23:04.910
And this is to be found not
in any creature, but in God

00:23:04.910 --> 00:23:07.131
alone."

00:23:07.131 --> 00:23:08.630
Now, can I submit
to you, everybody,

00:23:08.630 --> 00:23:13.466
this is the moral wisdom of
the great biblical tradition.

00:23:13.466 --> 00:23:14.840
And the roots of
this go way back

00:23:14.840 --> 00:23:16.590
into the scriptures themselves.

00:23:16.590 --> 00:23:21.210
But this is the way Aquinas
analyzes it philosophically.

00:23:21.210 --> 00:23:26.150
What we want cannot be met
by anything in this world.

00:23:26.150 --> 00:23:29.630
Just as what the
mind wants does not

00:23:29.630 --> 00:23:33.200
correspond to any particular bit
of knowledge within the world.

00:23:33.200 --> 00:23:35.600
The mind wants to know
unconditioned truth.

00:23:35.600 --> 00:23:39.590
The will wants the
unconditioned good.

00:23:39.590 --> 00:23:45.740
That hunger is at the source
of religion, it seems to me.

00:23:45.740 --> 00:23:50.150
That opening up of the
questing mind and heart

00:23:50.150 --> 00:23:52.100
is what it's all about.

00:23:52.100 --> 00:23:52.850
OK.

00:23:52.850 --> 00:23:56.480
Now, can I turn from that
little philosophical analysis

00:23:56.480 --> 00:23:57.830
to the Bible?

00:23:57.830 --> 00:24:01.850
And I want to share with you a
story that I've always loved.

00:24:01.850 --> 00:24:05.060
And I think it speaks
precisely to this point.

00:24:05.060 --> 00:24:11.210
It's a story from the First Book
of Kings in the Old Testament.

00:24:11.210 --> 00:24:16.130
It's a story dealing with
Elijah and the priests of Baal.

00:24:16.130 --> 00:24:20.300
Now, as I tell the story,
you might remember it.

00:24:20.300 --> 00:24:25.610
During this period, Israel had
gone over to false worship.

00:24:25.610 --> 00:24:29.290
So King Ahab-- remember,
so Melville calls his,

00:24:29.290 --> 00:24:30.664
you know, Captain Ahab.

00:24:30.664 --> 00:24:31.580
And poor Captain Ahab.

00:24:31.580 --> 00:24:33.740
Because we hear in
the Bible that Ahab

00:24:33.740 --> 00:24:37.220
is worse than all the
kings of Israel combined.

00:24:37.220 --> 00:24:40.230
And knowing the rogues'
gallery of the kings of Israel,

00:24:40.230 --> 00:24:41.870
that's saying a mouthful, right?

00:24:41.870 --> 00:24:43.760
So Ahab is a really bad guy.

00:24:43.760 --> 00:24:46.640
More to it, his wife,
Jezebel, has now drawn him

00:24:46.640 --> 00:24:50.180
into the worship of false gods.

00:24:50.180 --> 00:24:52.040
So Elijah, the
prophet, rises up.

00:24:52.040 --> 00:24:54.740
We know nothing
about him except he's

00:24:54.740 --> 00:24:56.180
from the little town of Tishbe.

00:24:56.180 --> 00:24:57.909
Now, talk to
specialist historians

00:24:57.909 --> 00:25:00.200
of the ancient world, they
don't know where Tishbe was.

00:25:00.200 --> 00:25:01.533
So we know nothing about Elijah.

00:25:01.533 --> 00:25:03.710
He suddenly appears
on the scene.

00:25:03.710 --> 00:25:05.402
And he challenges Ahab.

00:25:05.402 --> 00:25:06.860
He says, you know
the drought we're

00:25:06.860 --> 00:25:08.420
having here in this country?

00:25:08.420 --> 00:25:11.590
It's because of
the false worship.

00:25:11.590 --> 00:25:14.060
Pretty interesting
thing now in the Bible.

00:25:14.060 --> 00:25:18.950
Never read the punishments
of God as somehow arbitrary.

00:25:18.950 --> 00:25:21.620
God's just having a bad
day, and so he's imposing

00:25:21.620 --> 00:25:23.180
this arbitrary-- no, no.

00:25:23.180 --> 00:25:24.335
It's spiritual physics.

00:25:26.840 --> 00:25:27.399
The garden.

00:25:27.399 --> 00:25:28.440
Go back to the beginning.

00:25:28.440 --> 00:25:30.980
What's the garden symbolic
of but flourishing?

00:25:30.980 --> 00:25:34.790
The flourishing that God
wants for his people.

00:25:34.790 --> 00:25:37.730
Adam and Eve expelled from
the garden, not capriciously,

00:25:37.730 --> 00:25:40.640
arbitrarily, but as
spiritual physics.

00:25:40.640 --> 00:25:44.690
When we fall away from God, we
tend to fall into lifelessness.

00:25:44.690 --> 00:25:45.890
That's the point.

00:25:45.890 --> 00:25:48.440
And so the drought, now,
that Elijah points out,

00:25:48.440 --> 00:25:51.730
is a function of false worship.

00:25:51.730 --> 00:25:52.490
Now, let me just--

00:25:52.490 --> 00:25:54.156
I'm going to dwell
on that for a second.

00:25:54.156 --> 00:25:57.380
Keep Aquinas in mind and [LATIN]
and the seeking of the good,

00:25:57.380 --> 00:25:58.070
right?

00:25:58.070 --> 00:26:00.320
And keep in mind
those substitutes

00:26:00.320 --> 00:26:04.640
for [LATIN],, wealth,
pleasure, honor, power.

00:26:04.640 --> 00:26:07.220
The very beginning of
the book of Genesis,

00:26:07.220 --> 00:26:11.170
we hear about God making the
heavens and the earth, right?

00:26:11.170 --> 00:26:15.530
And everything is coming
forth in this orderly manner.

00:26:15.530 --> 00:26:18.260
Mind you, please, not
science, high poetry this is.

00:26:18.260 --> 00:26:18.920
Right?

00:26:18.920 --> 00:26:21.620
So as things come forth
in this orderly way,

00:26:21.620 --> 00:26:23.430
let there be light,
and there was light.

00:26:23.430 --> 00:26:25.490
Let the earth come
forth, it came forth.

00:26:25.490 --> 00:26:29.630
Let the earth teem with
animals, and so on and so forth.

00:26:29.630 --> 00:26:32.600
Stars and the planets
all come forth

00:26:32.600 --> 00:26:35.120
in this orderly
procession from God.

00:26:35.120 --> 00:26:38.690
Two basic moves are being
made here, symbolically.

00:26:38.690 --> 00:26:43.250
First of all, the
author is dethroning

00:26:43.250 --> 00:26:46.160
all these false
claimants to divinity.

00:26:46.160 --> 00:26:48.800
Think for a second of the
planets, the moon, the stars,

00:26:48.800 --> 00:26:51.290
mountains, animals, the
river, et cetera-- what

00:26:51.290 --> 00:26:52.770
do they all have in common?

00:26:52.770 --> 00:26:54.800
They were all, at
one point or another,

00:26:54.800 --> 00:26:57.110
worshiped in the ancient world.

00:26:57.110 --> 00:26:59.900
These are all gods
worthy of worship.

00:26:59.900 --> 00:27:06.040
The author of Genesis is
saying, no, no, no, no, no.

00:27:06.040 --> 00:27:10.300
These are all creatures
of God, not God.

00:27:10.300 --> 00:27:12.430
Don't worship them.

00:27:12.430 --> 00:27:13.450
Are they good?

00:27:13.450 --> 00:27:14.380
Yes.

00:27:14.380 --> 00:27:17.080
And the conglomeration,
indeed, is very good.

00:27:17.080 --> 00:27:19.810
But they're not God.

00:27:19.810 --> 00:27:21.880
Don't worship them.

00:27:21.880 --> 00:27:23.589
Now, here's the second
point he's making.

00:27:23.589 --> 00:27:25.171
And here the Catholics
will understand

00:27:25.171 --> 00:27:26.260
what I'm talking about.

00:27:26.260 --> 00:27:30.370
As these things come forth
in an orderly manner, one

00:27:30.370 --> 00:27:32.890
after the other, in
a stately procession,

00:27:32.890 --> 00:27:36.140
what does that remind you of?

00:27:36.140 --> 00:27:40.240
It should remind you a bit
of the mass and of the way

00:27:40.240 --> 00:27:43.695
the ministers of
the mass process in.

00:27:43.695 --> 00:27:45.070
The mass, of
course, the roots go

00:27:45.070 --> 00:27:48.820
way back into the Jewish
temple rituals and so on.

00:27:48.820 --> 00:27:50.170
There's the idea.

00:27:50.170 --> 00:27:51.370
Nothing in the world is God.

00:27:51.370 --> 00:27:52.240
Don't worship them.

00:27:52.240 --> 00:27:54.910
But everything in
the world is meant

00:27:54.910 --> 00:27:59.620
to turn to God in right praise.

00:27:59.620 --> 00:28:01.120
That's the purpose
of creation is

00:28:01.120 --> 00:28:03.790
to turn to God in right praise.

00:28:03.790 --> 00:28:07.367
And who comes at the
end of this procession?

00:28:07.367 --> 00:28:08.950
Well, there's the
human beings, right?

00:28:08.950 --> 00:28:10.570
Adam and Eve.

00:28:10.570 --> 00:28:13.712
Who comes at the end of
a liturgical procession

00:28:13.712 --> 00:28:15.420
but the priest or the
bishop, the one who

00:28:15.420 --> 00:28:17.530
is going to lead the praise?

00:28:17.530 --> 00:28:19.540
That's the idea.

00:28:19.540 --> 00:28:23.500
Dethrone all false
claimants to divinity.

00:28:23.500 --> 00:28:24.740
Nothing in the world is God.

00:28:24.740 --> 00:28:26.950
Don't worship those things.

00:28:26.950 --> 00:28:29.290
But rather let all
those things be

00:28:29.290 --> 00:28:32.980
part of a great
chorus of praise led

00:28:32.980 --> 00:28:37.870
by human beings
who can give voice

00:28:37.870 --> 00:28:39.895
to the praise of creation.

00:28:39.895 --> 00:28:41.210
Does that make sense?

00:28:41.210 --> 00:28:42.340
That's the biblical vision.

00:28:42.340 --> 00:28:44.280
That's the biblical vision.

00:28:44.280 --> 00:28:46.360
Right praise.

00:28:46.360 --> 00:28:47.470
I love this connection.

00:28:47.470 --> 00:28:51.760
The word adoration, from
two Latin words, [LATIN]..

00:28:54.580 --> 00:28:56.110
[LATIN] means mouth, right?

00:28:56.110 --> 00:28:59.230
[LATIN] is mouth to mouth.

00:28:59.230 --> 00:29:02.740
To adore god is to be
mouth to mouth with God.

00:29:02.740 --> 00:29:04.500
It means lined up.

00:29:04.500 --> 00:29:08.080
A line, see, under
the power of God.

00:29:08.080 --> 00:29:13.220
In that stance, we
find who we are.

00:29:13.220 --> 00:29:15.450
Another little etymology thing.

00:29:15.450 --> 00:29:17.950
Worship, our word worship.

00:29:17.950 --> 00:29:21.250
Go back now to Chaucerian
times and older English form,

00:29:21.250 --> 00:29:25.170
is worth ship.

00:29:25.170 --> 00:29:27.880
What's of highest worth?

00:29:27.880 --> 00:29:29.535
That's what you worship.

00:29:29.535 --> 00:29:30.910
Now, again, this
means everybody.

00:29:30.910 --> 00:29:33.140
This is believer,
nonbeliever, everybody.

00:29:33.140 --> 00:29:35.410
This is religious
person, atheist.

00:29:35.410 --> 00:29:39.210
Everybody in this room
worships something.

00:29:39.210 --> 00:29:43.560
There is something of
highest worth to you.

00:29:43.560 --> 00:29:44.720
Remember [LATIN].

00:29:44.720 --> 00:29:46.161
Everyone's seeking happiness.

00:29:46.161 --> 00:29:46.660
Everyone.

00:29:46.660 --> 00:29:48.350
There's no way around that.

00:29:48.350 --> 00:29:49.570
What is it?

00:29:49.570 --> 00:29:50.950
What is it?

00:29:50.950 --> 00:29:52.870
And see, the author
of Genesis is saying,

00:29:52.870 --> 00:29:55.450
don't let anything
in the world be

00:29:55.450 --> 00:30:02.140
the object of your
worth-ship but God alone.

00:30:02.140 --> 00:30:06.100
Wealth, pleasure, honor,
power, any creaturely thing,

00:30:06.100 --> 00:30:09.580
that will not lead you to
the [LATIN] that you want,

00:30:09.580 --> 00:30:12.030
but only the right
praise of God.

00:30:12.030 --> 00:30:17.290
And can I submit to you, I think
that's lesson one of the Bible.

00:30:17.290 --> 00:30:21.190
It's what the Bible is about
from Genesis to Revelation.

00:30:21.190 --> 00:30:24.250
It's about right praise.

00:30:24.250 --> 00:30:26.470
And don't interpret
that in a fussy way,

00:30:26.470 --> 00:30:30.270
but rather in this deep,
sort of metaphysical way.

00:30:30.270 --> 00:30:33.190
Right praise means the right
ordering of one's life.

00:30:33.190 --> 00:30:36.580
Worth-shipping God alone.

00:30:36.580 --> 00:30:38.200
When you do that,
where do you live?

00:30:38.200 --> 00:30:39.370
In a garden.

00:30:39.370 --> 00:30:41.980
That means you live
in a place of life.

00:30:41.980 --> 00:30:47.230
When you stop worth-shipping God
alone, welcome to the desert.

00:30:47.230 --> 00:30:50.610
That's the biblical symbolism.

00:30:50.610 --> 00:30:51.310
OK.

00:30:51.310 --> 00:30:53.080
So with all that in
mind, go back now

00:30:53.080 --> 00:30:56.350
to Elijah and King Ahab.

00:30:56.350 --> 00:30:58.450
He says, the trouble
here, Ahab, is

00:30:58.450 --> 00:30:59.890
you're worshipping false gods.

00:30:59.890 --> 00:31:02.080
That's always the problem.

00:31:02.080 --> 00:31:03.930
Fellow sinners.

00:31:03.930 --> 00:31:04.480
Right?

00:31:04.480 --> 00:31:05.680
That's always the problem.

00:31:05.680 --> 00:31:09.610
I'm worth-shipping
something other than God.

00:31:09.610 --> 00:31:11.010
Well, is Ahab happy about this?

00:31:11.010 --> 00:31:12.250
No, no, no.

00:31:12.250 --> 00:31:16.260
He says, get lost, you
troubler of Israel.

00:31:16.260 --> 00:31:19.096
And Elijah, again, all we
know about him is his name.

00:31:19.096 --> 00:31:20.470
But you know what
his name means?

00:31:20.470 --> 00:31:21.640
It tells you everything.

00:31:21.640 --> 00:31:28.130
Eliyahu in Hebrew, Elijah,
Eliyahu means Yahweh is my god.

00:31:28.130 --> 00:31:30.460
His whole being is
summed up in that.

00:31:30.460 --> 00:31:32.820
I don't worship anything
anybody but Yahweh.

00:31:32.820 --> 00:31:33.790
Yahweh is my god.

00:31:33.790 --> 00:31:35.380
Eliyahu.

00:31:35.380 --> 00:31:38.130
And so he prophetically
challenges Ahab.

00:31:38.130 --> 00:31:39.370
And here's what he says.

00:31:39.370 --> 00:31:43.720
He says, look, you get all the
priests and prophets of Baal,

00:31:43.720 --> 00:31:45.700
so the gods that they
were worshipping,

00:31:45.700 --> 00:31:47.350
and let's all go
to Mount Carmel,

00:31:47.350 --> 00:31:51.830
and I'm going to go up there,
and let's have a challenge.

00:31:51.830 --> 00:31:56.620
And so the 450 priests of Baal
go up Mount Carmel, and then

00:31:56.620 --> 00:31:58.530
the one Elijah.

00:31:58.530 --> 00:32:01.600
Now, in that there's an
important lesson too.

00:32:01.600 --> 00:32:06.440
The avatars of the false gods
are always thick on the ground.

00:32:06.440 --> 00:32:07.280
True then?

00:32:07.280 --> 00:32:07.850
Uh-huh.

00:32:07.850 --> 00:32:08.750
True today?

00:32:08.750 --> 00:32:10.560
Yes.

00:32:10.560 --> 00:32:12.980
Wealth, pleasure, honor,
power, by the way,

00:32:12.980 --> 00:32:16.460
the avatars of those
things, are they everywhere?

00:32:16.460 --> 00:32:17.190
Uh-huh.

00:32:17.190 --> 00:32:19.880
They're always
thick on the ground.

00:32:19.880 --> 00:32:24.160
The representatives of God tend
to be a much smaller number.

00:32:24.160 --> 00:32:27.950
So the one Elijah against
the 450 priests of Baal.

00:32:27.950 --> 00:32:30.320
And then, of course,
that wonderful story

00:32:30.320 --> 00:32:32.352
unfolds, which actually
is quite funny.

00:32:32.352 --> 00:32:34.560
And the friends of mine who
know Hebrew really well--

00:32:34.560 --> 00:32:35.780
I don't know it that well--

00:32:35.780 --> 00:32:40.730
will tell me that the humor
really comes out in the Hebrew.

00:32:40.730 --> 00:32:43.170
Let me read you
some of the lines.

00:32:43.170 --> 00:32:46.970
So the priest of Baal
set up the altars,

00:32:46.970 --> 00:32:49.220
and then they begin to
supplicate and to beg

00:32:49.220 --> 00:32:52.250
and to pray that their gods
will come and send fire

00:32:52.250 --> 00:32:53.600
to consume the sacrifice.

00:32:53.600 --> 00:32:55.100
Because that was the challenge.

00:32:55.100 --> 00:32:57.530
You call on your gods
and see what happens.

00:32:57.530 --> 00:33:00.470
And I'll call on mine, and
we'll see which one responds.

00:33:00.470 --> 00:33:04.700
So they begin to beg and so on.

00:33:04.700 --> 00:33:09.050
And Elijah, around midday,
begins to mock them.

00:33:09.050 --> 00:33:12.800
Because no fire is coming to
answer their-- he mocks them.

00:33:12.800 --> 00:33:14.220
Cry louder.

00:33:14.220 --> 00:33:18.140
Baal is a god, but he
may be detained in talk.

00:33:18.140 --> 00:33:21.770
Or maybe he's lodging abroad,
or maybe he's on a journey,

00:33:21.770 --> 00:33:25.340
or maybe he's fallen
asleep and needs awakening.

00:33:25.340 --> 00:33:27.710
So he's mocking the
priests of Baal.

00:33:27.710 --> 00:33:29.690
And now they're kind
of stung by this.

00:33:29.690 --> 00:33:32.030
And so then they take
out swords, we hear,

00:33:32.030 --> 00:33:34.490
and they slash themselves
till they bleed.

00:33:34.490 --> 00:33:36.800
That was a sign of
greater supplication.

00:33:36.800 --> 00:33:40.310
And still they beg,
and still they cajole,

00:33:40.310 --> 00:33:43.470
and still no fire falls.

00:33:43.470 --> 00:33:47.030
Then Elijah comes
forward to his altar.

00:33:47.030 --> 00:33:48.680
He says, hear me,
O Lord, hear me.

00:33:48.680 --> 00:33:52.220
Prove to all the people
that thou art the Lord God

00:33:52.220 --> 00:33:55.130
and are calling their
hearts back to thee.

00:33:55.130 --> 00:33:57.680
And with that, we hear
the fire comes down,

00:33:57.680 --> 00:33:59.600
consumes the sacrifice.

00:33:59.600 --> 00:34:01.280
Elijah wins.

00:34:01.280 --> 00:34:02.090
OK.

00:34:02.090 --> 00:34:04.390
But here's what I want
you all to see, please.

00:34:04.390 --> 00:34:08.179
That this is not just a my
god is bigger than your god.

00:34:08.179 --> 00:34:11.659
It's not just kind of
a chauvinistic story.

00:34:11.659 --> 00:34:16.210
This is making the same point
that Thomas Aquinas was making,

00:34:16.210 --> 00:34:18.800
it seems to me.

00:34:18.800 --> 00:34:20.800
Look, everybody's got
a hungry heart, right?

00:34:20.800 --> 00:34:23.679
Bruce Springsteen taught us
that, saying the same thing.

00:34:23.679 --> 00:34:25.239
Everyone's got a hungry heart.

00:34:25.239 --> 00:34:27.040
Everybody wants [LATIN].

00:34:27.040 --> 00:34:28.330
So what do we do?

00:34:28.330 --> 00:34:31.150
We worth-ship something.

00:34:31.150 --> 00:34:33.144
Everybody does it.

00:34:33.144 --> 00:34:34.810
Paul Tillich, the
Protestant theologian,

00:34:34.810 --> 00:34:36.940
said that all you need to
know about a person you

00:34:36.940 --> 00:34:40.870
can learn by asking one
question, what do you worship?

00:34:40.870 --> 00:34:42.909
It's dead right, it seems to me.

00:34:42.909 --> 00:34:45.159
Because your life will
be organized around what

00:34:45.159 --> 00:34:47.030
you take to be
the highest value.

00:34:47.030 --> 00:34:49.810
So think of the
priests of Baal now.

00:34:49.810 --> 00:34:53.260
Think, if you want,
of four altars,

00:34:53.260 --> 00:34:59.620
erected to wealth,
pleasure, power, honor.

00:34:59.620 --> 00:35:01.930
What do most of us sinners
do most of the time

00:35:01.930 --> 00:35:07.360
is we hop around one or
more of those altars.

00:35:07.360 --> 00:35:11.400
We worth-ship one or
more of these things.

00:35:11.400 --> 00:35:14.080
I think everyone can
tell the story, right?

00:35:14.080 --> 00:35:16.780
I know lots of young
people that got very early

00:35:16.780 --> 00:35:19.480
on the train toward wealth.

00:35:19.480 --> 00:35:21.190
And they worshipped it.

00:35:21.190 --> 00:35:22.720
They devoted themselves to it.

00:35:22.720 --> 00:35:26.470
They hopped around the altar.

00:35:26.470 --> 00:35:27.640
Did it satisfy them?

00:35:27.640 --> 00:35:28.960
No, it can't.

00:35:28.960 --> 00:35:30.400
And we just saw why.

00:35:30.400 --> 00:35:33.349
Because the hunger is infinite,
and no amount of wealth

00:35:33.349 --> 00:35:34.390
is going to satisfy that.

00:35:37.100 --> 00:35:39.850
So what happens then?

00:35:39.850 --> 00:35:42.810
You get addicted.

00:35:42.810 --> 00:35:43.830
You see why.

00:35:43.830 --> 00:35:45.750
I'm searching for wealth.

00:35:45.750 --> 00:35:46.740
And I got it.

00:35:46.740 --> 00:35:50.040
I got my first million
by 30 or whatever it is.

00:35:50.040 --> 00:35:53.130
And I got a little buzz
from that, as you do.

00:35:53.130 --> 00:35:54.420
But then the buzz wears off.

00:35:54.420 --> 00:35:55.050
It has to.

00:35:55.050 --> 00:35:57.720
Because you're not
built for that.

00:35:57.720 --> 00:36:00.420
And when the buzz wears off, I
better go back to that altar.

00:36:00.420 --> 00:36:02.670
I better keep
worth-shipping there.

00:36:02.670 --> 00:36:04.895
I better keep hopping
around that altar.

00:36:04.895 --> 00:36:08.250
I've got to get my first $10
million by 40 or whatever goals

00:36:08.250 --> 00:36:09.120
you have.

00:36:09.120 --> 00:36:13.149
And the buzz comes back, but
what will any addict tell you?

00:36:13.149 --> 00:36:14.940
We're all addicts in
this room, by the way.

00:36:14.940 --> 00:36:16.310
Because we're all sinners.

00:36:16.310 --> 00:36:17.610
What will any addict tell you?

00:36:17.610 --> 00:36:21.230
The buzz will wear off faster.

00:36:21.230 --> 00:36:23.770
And so now I panic.

00:36:23.770 --> 00:36:27.030
Remember them slashing
themselves with the knives

00:36:27.030 --> 00:36:28.350
until they're bleeding.

00:36:28.350 --> 00:36:31.110
That we'll harm
ourselves in the process

00:36:31.110 --> 00:36:34.180
of hopping around this altar.

00:36:34.180 --> 00:36:35.830
Power?

00:36:35.830 --> 00:36:36.330
Same thing.

00:36:36.330 --> 00:36:37.500
Same dynamic.

00:36:37.500 --> 00:36:40.840
Talk to people who very
early on got hooked on power.

00:36:40.840 --> 00:36:42.860
That's what will make
me happy, so I'm going

00:36:42.860 --> 00:36:45.090
to be worth-ship at that altar.

00:36:45.090 --> 00:36:47.010
[LATIN], man, it's power.

00:36:47.010 --> 00:36:47.910
That's what I want.

00:36:47.910 --> 00:36:50.550
And I get power, whatever
it was I'm going for,

00:36:50.550 --> 00:36:51.810
by the age of 30.

00:36:51.810 --> 00:36:54.480
And I get a buzz from
it, but it wears off.

00:36:54.480 --> 00:36:56.750
It has to.

00:36:56.750 --> 00:37:00.570
So I get more and more,
and I hop, and I cajole.

00:37:00.570 --> 00:37:04.170
And then before I know it,
I'm addicted to such a degree

00:37:04.170 --> 00:37:06.050
that I'm harming
myself in the process.

00:37:08.570 --> 00:37:09.590
Same with honors.

00:37:09.590 --> 00:37:13.170
Talk to anybody
who's on that train.

00:37:13.170 --> 00:37:14.630
I never get enough attention.

00:37:14.630 --> 00:37:16.040
They don't appreciate me.

00:37:16.040 --> 00:37:17.430
Why did he get that job?

00:37:17.430 --> 00:37:21.080
Why do I not have
the honors I deserve?

00:37:21.080 --> 00:37:23.480
I've been worth-shipping
at that altar all my life,

00:37:23.480 --> 00:37:24.830
people will say.

00:37:24.830 --> 00:37:27.860
It's not designed to satisfy
you because [LATIN] is not

00:37:27.860 --> 00:37:28.580
found there.

00:37:31.110 --> 00:37:33.060
What does Elijah represent?

00:37:33.060 --> 00:37:35.440
Again, don't think of it so
much kind of chauvinistically

00:37:35.440 --> 00:37:36.630
and nationalistically.

00:37:36.630 --> 00:37:42.690
What does Elijah represent
but the worth-shipping

00:37:42.690 --> 00:37:47.580
of the true God,
the infinite truth,

00:37:47.580 --> 00:37:50.460
the infinite goodness of God?

00:37:50.460 --> 00:37:53.400
When you order your life
that way, listen now,

00:37:53.400 --> 00:37:56.110
the fire will fall.

00:37:56.110 --> 00:37:57.330
That's the point.

00:37:57.330 --> 00:37:59.580
Then the fire will fall.

00:37:59.580 --> 00:38:02.180
Because now you hooked
your infinite desire

00:38:02.180 --> 00:38:05.160
onto the properly
infinite object,

00:38:05.160 --> 00:38:07.800
and the fire will
fall and consume

00:38:07.800 --> 00:38:13.170
the sacrifice of your
life and make it radiant

00:38:13.170 --> 00:38:16.510
and bring it to a
heightened fulfillment.

00:38:16.510 --> 00:38:17.340
There's the Bible.

00:38:17.340 --> 00:38:19.170
That's the lesson
the Bible has for us,

00:38:19.170 --> 00:38:23.070
which is as relevant
in 2018 as it ever was.

00:38:23.070 --> 00:38:24.450
Because I could introduce you--

00:38:24.450 --> 00:38:26.460
you all know this, you
do the same thing--

00:38:26.460 --> 00:38:29.280
introduce you to dozens
and dozens of people

00:38:29.280 --> 00:38:33.900
that I know who are hopping
around these four altars.

00:38:33.900 --> 00:38:37.720
It's only true worth-ship that
will give me satisfaction.

00:38:37.720 --> 00:38:38.220
OK.

00:38:38.220 --> 00:38:39.845
I'm going to make
one more little step,

00:38:39.845 --> 00:38:41.482
and then we'll
bring it to a close.

00:38:41.482 --> 00:38:45.540
Here's where it gets, I
think, really interesting.

00:38:45.540 --> 00:38:49.700
So God alone will satisfy the
deepest hunger of my heart.

00:38:49.700 --> 00:38:50.200
OK.

00:38:50.200 --> 00:38:52.350
Got that.

00:38:52.350 --> 00:38:57.780
I've got to get God in me to
satisfy my desire for [LATIN]..

00:38:57.780 --> 00:39:00.330
But who is God?

00:39:00.330 --> 00:39:05.770
In the biblical
reading, God is love.

00:39:05.770 --> 00:39:07.500
St. John tells us that.

00:39:07.500 --> 00:39:09.420
And that's a distinctively
Christian idea.

00:39:09.420 --> 00:39:12.360
Because it's not
that God simply loves

00:39:12.360 --> 00:39:14.910
or that God has the
attribute of love.

00:39:14.910 --> 00:39:15.790
It's what God is.

00:39:18.380 --> 00:39:21.470
Father, Son, Holy Spirit,
by the way, lover, beloved,

00:39:21.470 --> 00:39:22.400
and shared love.

00:39:22.400 --> 00:39:24.709
That's who God is, is love.

00:39:24.709 --> 00:39:25.625
So here's the paradox.

00:39:28.610 --> 00:39:31.160
Only in God is my soul at rest.

00:39:31.160 --> 00:39:34.580
Only when I have God in
me do I have [LATIN]..

00:39:34.580 --> 00:39:36.770
But God is love.

00:39:36.770 --> 00:39:42.440
Therefore, only when I
give away what God gives

00:39:42.440 --> 00:39:45.530
me do I have the
[LATIN] that I seek.

00:39:48.160 --> 00:39:49.750
Love is willing the
good of the other.

00:39:49.750 --> 00:39:51.670
Love is giving away.

00:39:51.670 --> 00:39:55.660
And so as the divine life comes
into me, what do I do with it?

00:39:55.660 --> 00:39:57.210
Don't hang on to it.

00:39:57.210 --> 00:40:00.670
Now reread the prodigal son,
if you want the physics there.

00:40:00.670 --> 00:40:02.620
Father, give me my
share coming to me.

00:40:02.620 --> 00:40:03.830
Give me, me, me, me.

00:40:03.830 --> 00:40:05.590
Give it to me, so I can have it.

00:40:05.590 --> 00:40:06.520
What happens to him?

00:40:06.520 --> 00:40:07.960
Fritters it away.

00:40:07.960 --> 00:40:09.320
Not arbitrary punishment.

00:40:09.320 --> 00:40:10.720
That's spiritual physics.

00:40:10.720 --> 00:40:13.360
You try to hang onto
it, you'll lose it.

00:40:13.360 --> 00:40:16.480
But when you give away
the divine life that's

00:40:16.480 --> 00:40:22.310
flowing into you, now
it increases in you 30,

00:40:22.310 --> 00:40:26.110
60, and a hundredfold, right?

00:40:26.110 --> 00:40:31.880
You get the love that God
is in you by giving it away.

00:40:31.880 --> 00:40:34.060
You see why this Christian
thing is so hard to get,

00:40:34.060 --> 00:40:35.950
because it's so
counterintuitive.

00:40:35.950 --> 00:40:39.190
Fellow sinners in this
room, what's our hangup?

00:40:39.190 --> 00:40:40.420
Look, I'm unhappy.

00:40:40.420 --> 00:40:41.520
We all are, by the way.

00:40:41.520 --> 00:40:43.144
I don't mean
psychologically depressed.

00:40:43.144 --> 00:40:44.290
I mean we're all unhappy.

00:40:44.290 --> 00:40:47.170
We're all unsatisfied
in this room.

00:40:47.170 --> 00:40:48.430
So I know, I know.

00:40:48.430 --> 00:40:49.441
I'm missing something.

00:40:49.441 --> 00:40:49.940
That's it.

00:40:49.940 --> 00:40:54.220
I'm missing requisite wealth,
pleasure, power, or honor.

00:40:54.220 --> 00:40:55.132
That's our instinct.

00:40:55.132 --> 00:40:56.340
I've got to get more of that.

00:40:56.340 --> 00:40:57.820
I've got to fill myself up.

00:40:57.820 --> 00:40:59.590
That's never the answer.

00:40:59.590 --> 00:41:00.700
That's never the answer.

00:41:00.700 --> 00:41:03.250
In fact, that's
counter indicated.

00:41:03.250 --> 00:41:06.280
That will lead to
addiction and unhappiness.

00:41:06.280 --> 00:41:12.130
Rather, contrive a way to give
your life away, and you'll

00:41:12.130 --> 00:41:17.640
find the [LATIN] that
you're actually seeking.

00:41:17.640 --> 00:41:19.460
See, I'm saying
about the questing

00:41:19.460 --> 00:41:22.820
mind and the searching heart.

00:41:22.820 --> 00:41:24.920
When they open up to
the infinite source

00:41:24.920 --> 00:41:29.660
of love, that's when they
find the [LATIN] they seek.

00:41:29.660 --> 00:41:33.290
So how about I'll just give
Saint Augustine the last word.

00:41:33.290 --> 00:41:35.030
If you go back to the
great "Confessions

00:41:35.030 --> 00:41:37.790
of Saint Augustine,"
one of the masterworks

00:41:37.790 --> 00:41:41.930
of the Western world,
page one, you'll

00:41:41.930 --> 00:41:45.980
find this little pithy statement
of Christian anthropology.

00:41:45.980 --> 00:41:48.620
Lord, you've made
us for yourself.

00:41:48.620 --> 00:41:53.712
Therefore, our heart is
restless until it rests in thee.

00:41:53.712 --> 00:41:56.090
There's no better
statement of what I've been

00:41:56.090 --> 00:41:58.460
trying to say all this talk.

00:41:58.460 --> 00:42:00.410
Lord, you've made
us for yourself.

00:42:00.410 --> 00:42:03.590
That's the infinite hunger.

00:42:03.590 --> 00:42:06.260
We're not like a dog,
satisfies its basic needs

00:42:06.260 --> 00:42:08.360
and goes blissfully to
sleep, utterly happy.

00:42:08.360 --> 00:42:08.975
It's terrific.

00:42:08.975 --> 00:42:10.730
That's what dogs
are designed for.

00:42:10.730 --> 00:42:13.220
But we're not designed that way.

00:42:13.220 --> 00:42:14.880
Lord, you made us for yourself.

00:42:14.880 --> 00:42:16.600
We've got an infinite longing.

00:42:16.600 --> 00:42:18.600
Therefore-- and this is
beautiful in Augustine--

00:42:18.600 --> 00:42:20.700
therefore, our heart, he says.

00:42:20.700 --> 00:42:23.610
He doesn't say
chordae, our hearts.

00:42:23.610 --> 00:42:25.550
He says [LATIN].

00:42:25.550 --> 00:42:29.180
See, what he means is we've
all got this in common.

00:42:29.180 --> 00:42:31.160
This links everybody together.

00:42:31.160 --> 00:42:36.130
[LATIN],, our heart is restless
until it rests in thee.

00:42:36.130 --> 00:42:39.920
And that means
conformed unto love.

00:42:39.920 --> 00:42:42.350
That's [LATIN].

00:42:42.350 --> 00:42:43.140
Thanks, everybody.

00:42:43.140 --> 00:42:44.014
Thanks for listening.

00:42:44.014 --> 00:42:47.264
[APPLAUSE]

00:42:51.200 --> 00:42:52.184
Thank you.

00:42:57.069 --> 00:42:58.485
MELISSA: Thank
you, Bishop Barron.

00:42:58.485 --> 00:42:58.800
ROBERT BARRON: Thank you all.

00:42:58.800 --> 00:42:59.640
Go ahead, please.

00:42:59.640 --> 00:43:01.598
MELISSA: So we are going
to have Q&amp;A right now.

00:43:01.598 --> 00:43:02.892
So [? Davo ?] is over there.

00:43:02.892 --> 00:43:04.350
He's going to run
around with a mic

00:43:04.350 --> 00:43:06.240
if there's any live questions.

00:43:06.240 --> 00:43:08.850
And I will read out some
questions from the Dory.

00:43:08.850 --> 00:43:11.850
So let's start with
one from the Dory.

00:43:11.850 --> 00:43:14.880
We have John Nolan in
Mountain View asking,

00:43:14.880 --> 00:43:17.700
when scientists and atheists
talk about religion,

00:43:17.700 --> 00:43:21.210
they seem to be stuck rehashing
debates of previous centuries,

00:43:21.210 --> 00:43:24.240
evolution, age of the
Earth, heliocentrism.

00:43:24.240 --> 00:43:27.630
What can be done to convince
science-minded skeptics

00:43:27.630 --> 00:43:29.280
that religious
belief systems have

00:43:29.280 --> 00:43:31.617
something valuable to
offer in the 21st century?

00:43:31.617 --> 00:43:32.700
ROBERT BARRON: Yeah, good.

00:43:32.700 --> 00:43:35.081
It's a question I wrestle
with all the time.

00:43:35.081 --> 00:43:36.580
First of all, all
the things they've

00:43:36.580 --> 00:43:39.120
raised there, from my
perspective as a Catholic,

00:43:39.120 --> 00:43:40.410
are non-issues.

00:43:40.410 --> 00:43:42.500
So how old is the earth?

00:43:42.500 --> 00:43:43.180
Don't ask me.

00:43:43.180 --> 00:43:44.450
Ask a scientist.

00:43:44.450 --> 00:43:46.320
How did biological
things develop?

00:43:46.320 --> 00:43:46.890
Don't ask me.

00:43:46.890 --> 00:43:48.840
Ask an evolutionary biologist.

00:43:48.840 --> 00:43:51.420
Those are scientific
questions, properly so.

00:43:51.420 --> 00:43:53.169
The Bible is not science.

00:43:53.169 --> 00:43:55.710
The last book of the Bible is
written around the year 100 AD.

00:43:55.710 --> 00:43:57.970
The first scientific texts
are in the, let's say,

00:43:57.970 --> 00:43:59.070
16th century.

00:43:59.070 --> 00:44:00.310
The Bible is not science.

00:44:00.310 --> 00:44:01.350
It simply isn't.

00:44:01.350 --> 00:44:03.330
It's spirituality
and theology, making

00:44:03.330 --> 00:44:06.000
very profound
observations that are

00:44:06.000 --> 00:44:08.400
truthful about the
nature of reality.

00:44:08.400 --> 00:44:10.050
But not in a scientific mode.

00:44:10.050 --> 00:44:12.810
So first of all, to give
science its total due,

00:44:12.810 --> 00:44:14.880
that we're not in a
conflictual relationship.

00:44:14.880 --> 00:44:16.830
But then the second
move is this.

00:44:16.830 --> 00:44:18.870
To overcome our
terrible tendency

00:44:18.870 --> 00:44:21.130
in our culture toward scientism.

00:44:21.130 --> 00:44:24.480
And scientism is the
reduction of all knowledge

00:44:24.480 --> 00:44:26.970
to the scientific
form of knowledge.

00:44:26.970 --> 00:44:29.610
So what the scientific
method can give us--

00:44:29.610 --> 00:44:30.900
I love the scientific method.

00:44:30.900 --> 00:44:33.450
And look around us, I
mean, what it's produced.

00:44:33.450 --> 00:44:34.950
God bless it.

00:44:34.950 --> 00:44:38.130
But we shouldn't reduce
all forms of knowledge

00:44:38.130 --> 00:44:41.880
to what can be delivered
by the scientific method.

00:44:41.880 --> 00:44:43.980
Get out of Plato's cave,
if you want to go back

00:44:43.980 --> 00:44:45.900
to the Republic of Plato.

00:44:45.900 --> 00:44:48.840
Get out of the realm of simply
looking at shadows on the wall

00:44:48.840 --> 00:44:51.954
and come to much higher
levels of reality, accessed,

00:44:51.954 --> 00:44:53.370
I would argue,
through metaphysics

00:44:53.370 --> 00:44:54.690
and through philosophy.

00:44:54.690 --> 00:44:59.220
And so there I would give
science its total due.

00:44:59.220 --> 00:45:02.020
We're not in a conflictual
game with the sciences.

00:45:02.020 --> 00:45:04.860
But also not to allow the
sciences to draw everything

00:45:04.860 --> 00:45:07.030
into themselves.

00:45:07.030 --> 00:45:12.470
So that's a quick answer to a
subtle set of questions, there.

00:45:12.470 --> 00:45:13.350
Please.

00:45:13.350 --> 00:45:16.370
MELISSA: If anyone has a
question, just raise your hand.

00:45:16.370 --> 00:45:19.350
AUDIENCE: So [LATIN] and
the way you describe it,

00:45:19.350 --> 00:45:23.310
with its necessary
longing and desire

00:45:23.310 --> 00:45:27.930
and journeying towards it,
Eastern ideas like the Four

00:45:27.930 --> 00:45:30.900
Noble Truths say that this
is, in fact, something

00:45:30.900 --> 00:45:32.040
that we can move past.

00:45:32.040 --> 00:45:34.620
That it's not
completely universal.

00:45:34.620 --> 00:45:37.950
And that moving past this
desire and this longing

00:45:37.950 --> 00:45:41.310
is in fact a viable path
towards enlightenment.

00:45:41.310 --> 00:45:44.370
Is there a way to resolve
those Eastern ideas

00:45:44.370 --> 00:45:47.130
with what you said today, or is
that a fundamental difference?

00:45:47.130 --> 00:45:48.250
ROBERT BARRON: Yeah,
it's a good question.

00:45:48.250 --> 00:45:49.530
Of course, it would
take us a year

00:45:49.530 --> 00:45:50.760
to search it out completely.

00:45:50.760 --> 00:45:52.009
But I think that that's right.

00:45:52.009 --> 00:45:53.090
There's a key difference.

00:45:53.090 --> 00:45:55.380
Because it's the
quieting of desire.

00:45:55.380 --> 00:45:56.150
You know, Nirvana.

00:45:56.150 --> 00:45:58.620
It's the blowing out of
the candle of desire.

00:45:58.620 --> 00:46:00.600
That is the goal of
the Buddhist tradition.

00:46:00.600 --> 00:46:02.610
And desire, in a way, is
the problem, you know,

00:46:02.610 --> 00:46:04.600
born of ego and so on.

00:46:04.600 --> 00:46:06.690
And so [? dependent ?]
[? co-origination ?]

00:46:06.690 --> 00:46:11.700
and through intense meditation,
one finds that point of putting

00:46:11.700 --> 00:46:13.010
out desire.

00:46:13.010 --> 00:46:16.860
Where the Christian thing,
and Augustine is typical here,

00:46:16.860 --> 00:46:20.880
is not putting out desire
but awakening and directing

00:46:20.880 --> 00:46:23.920
desire appropriately.

00:46:23.920 --> 00:46:26.340
Now, I think we can play,
as Thomas Merton did,

00:46:26.340 --> 00:46:29.000
the true self, false self game.

00:46:29.000 --> 00:46:33.090
And that's a good way, I think,
to dialogue with Buddhism.

00:46:33.090 --> 00:46:35.820
Is there a false
self that's full

00:46:35.820 --> 00:46:38.850
of all kinds of weird
and errant desires?

00:46:38.850 --> 00:46:39.530
Yeah.

00:46:39.530 --> 00:46:41.130
And that should be put to death.

00:46:41.130 --> 00:46:42.660
Blow that out if you want.

00:46:42.660 --> 00:46:45.450
Blow out the candle of
that kind of desire.

00:46:45.450 --> 00:46:48.060
But I would say as a Christian,
there's not just that.

00:46:48.060 --> 00:46:52.350
There's also a properly
directed desire, an awakened

00:46:52.350 --> 00:46:54.590
and heightened desire.

00:46:54.590 --> 00:46:57.660
But you're onto, I think,
a very fundamental point

00:46:57.660 --> 00:46:59.040
of demarcation.

00:46:59.040 --> 00:47:00.660
But I think true
self, false self

00:47:00.660 --> 00:47:03.960
might give us a Christian
analogy to the blowing

00:47:03.960 --> 00:47:05.820
out of errant desire.

00:47:05.820 --> 00:47:09.240
But we wouldn't go so far as
to say that desire, qua desire,

00:47:09.240 --> 00:47:09.900
is the problem.

00:47:13.250 --> 00:47:17.482
De Lubac talks about this,
[FRENCH],, this weird kind

00:47:17.482 --> 00:47:20.520
of crippling of desire.

00:47:20.520 --> 00:47:21.674
That's the problem.

00:47:21.674 --> 00:47:22.840
But that's a great question.

00:47:22.840 --> 00:47:24.480
It's the point of
demarcation, I think.

00:47:27.150 --> 00:47:29.190
Please, go ahead.

00:47:29.190 --> 00:47:31.530
MELISSA: We have another
question on the Dory.

00:47:31.530 --> 00:47:33.570
From Mike [? Rile ?]
in Mountain View.

00:47:33.570 --> 00:47:35.970
With the growth of technology
and the development

00:47:35.970 --> 00:47:38.610
of a globalized
community, what's

00:47:38.610 --> 00:47:40.200
the most important
thing that we can

00:47:40.200 --> 00:47:42.360
do as a group of
people dedicated

00:47:42.360 --> 00:47:45.000
to the advancement of
technology to ensure

00:47:45.000 --> 00:47:48.390
that our ethical and moral
growth as a global population

00:47:48.390 --> 00:47:50.506
doesn't fall behind our
technological growth?

00:47:50.506 --> 00:47:52.380
ROBERT BARRON: That's
a really good question.

00:47:52.380 --> 00:47:53.160
That's terrific.

00:47:53.160 --> 00:47:54.730
And I'm glad it's raised.

00:47:54.730 --> 00:47:56.230
You understand
the dynamic there.

00:47:56.230 --> 00:47:58.060
That we get so
enthusiastic about

00:47:58.060 --> 00:47:59.700
our technological advances.

00:47:59.700 --> 00:48:01.120
And again, God bless them.

00:48:01.120 --> 00:48:02.650
They're wonderful.

00:48:02.650 --> 00:48:08.027
But they must always be properly
haunted by the moral question.

00:48:08.027 --> 00:48:10.360
And the moral question is the
question of love, finally.

00:48:10.360 --> 00:48:11.890
I will speak as a Christian.

00:48:11.890 --> 00:48:15.040
To love is to will
the good of the other.

00:48:15.040 --> 00:48:17.980
Not my good through
you, but your good.

00:48:17.980 --> 00:48:19.480
I want what's good for you.

00:48:19.480 --> 00:48:20.590
That's love.

00:48:20.590 --> 00:48:23.410
And love must always dominate.

00:48:23.410 --> 00:48:25.670
Love must always be the
primary consideration.

00:48:25.670 --> 00:48:27.860
And so as our
technology advances,

00:48:27.860 --> 00:48:30.060
is it in service of love?

00:48:30.060 --> 00:48:35.140
Saint Augustine said, love
God, and do what you want.

00:48:35.140 --> 00:48:37.660
His point there
was as long as love

00:48:37.660 --> 00:48:41.040
is thoroughly
dominant in your life,

00:48:41.040 --> 00:48:43.220
then the rest will
take care of itself.

00:48:43.220 --> 00:48:47.700
So then your technological life
will find its proper place.

00:48:47.700 --> 00:48:48.670
So that's terrific.

00:48:48.670 --> 00:48:51.260
I'm glad that ethical,
spiritual question is raised,

00:48:51.260 --> 00:48:54.070
or else our technology
will destroy us.

00:48:54.070 --> 00:48:57.940
Because that's the-- look at
wealth, pleasure, honor, power.

00:48:57.940 --> 00:49:00.110
They'll turn on us.

00:49:00.110 --> 00:49:03.070
If we don't know how to
manage them spiritually,

00:49:03.070 --> 00:49:04.870
they'll manage us.

00:49:04.870 --> 00:49:06.234
Again, sound familiar?

00:49:06.234 --> 00:49:07.900
Every sinner in this
room, including me,

00:49:07.900 --> 00:49:09.190
we know what that's about.

00:49:09.190 --> 00:49:11.920
They start managing us.

00:49:11.920 --> 00:49:15.790
But we need to have the
sovereignty of love,

00:49:15.790 --> 00:49:18.230
and then these things
find their proper place.

00:49:18.230 --> 00:49:19.720
That's good.

00:49:19.720 --> 00:49:21.051
Please.

00:49:21.051 --> 00:49:21.550
Go ahead.

00:49:21.550 --> 00:49:22.566
Please.

00:49:22.566 --> 00:49:23.480
AUDIENCE: Is this on?

00:49:23.480 --> 00:49:24.140
OK.

00:49:24.140 --> 00:49:25.120
Hi.

00:49:25.120 --> 00:49:28.060
I think you might have already
partially answered my question.

00:49:28.060 --> 00:49:30.970
But during the
course of your talk,

00:49:30.970 --> 00:49:35.630
it sounds as if, OK, there
is the created world and ways

00:49:35.630 --> 00:49:38.290
to basically worship
or love those things,

00:49:38.290 --> 00:49:39.580
and then there is God.

00:49:39.580 --> 00:49:43.270
And is there a way to love God?

00:49:43.270 --> 00:49:44.830
I mean, there are so many of us.

00:49:44.830 --> 00:49:45.910
We're all so different.

00:49:45.910 --> 00:49:52.950
Is there a one way, or how do
we find our way to love God?

00:49:52.950 --> 00:49:55.760
Are there seven castles
that we should be aware of,

00:49:55.760 --> 00:49:59.402
or are we so different that
we have to make our own way?

00:49:59.402 --> 00:50:00.610
ROBERT BARRON: No, it's good.

00:50:00.610 --> 00:50:02.560
I mean, you're talking there
about the spiritual tradition.

00:50:02.560 --> 00:50:04.940
And you're making reference,
actually, to Teresa of Avila

00:50:04.940 --> 00:50:06.790
and so on, the interior castle.

00:50:06.790 --> 00:50:09.200
And there are different
paths that spiritual masters

00:50:09.200 --> 00:50:11.030
have laid out.

00:50:11.030 --> 00:50:14.415
And so we can find some of
those general categories.

00:50:14.415 --> 00:50:15.950
Everyone is different.

00:50:15.950 --> 00:50:17.650
Everyone's got a
unique personality.

00:50:17.650 --> 00:50:22.357
Everyone falls in love
with God differently.

00:50:22.357 --> 00:50:23.940
I would like to say,
John of the Cross

00:50:23.940 --> 00:50:25.960
is one of the great masters.

00:50:25.960 --> 00:50:29.470
John said, don't use the image
of climbing the holy mountain,

00:50:29.470 --> 00:50:30.640
which a lot of us will use.

00:50:30.640 --> 00:50:32.015
Like God's up
there, and I've got

00:50:32.015 --> 00:50:33.790
to find my way to get to him.

00:50:33.790 --> 00:50:37.540
But rather, God wants
nothing more than

00:50:37.540 --> 00:50:41.020
to move into your
life in a saving way,

00:50:41.020 --> 00:50:42.370
in a life-giving way.

00:50:42.370 --> 00:50:44.980
So the idea, John
of the Cross, is

00:50:44.980 --> 00:50:49.384
to clear the ground so
the helicopter can land.

00:50:49.384 --> 00:50:51.550
So don't think of, I've got
to get up that mountain.

00:50:51.550 --> 00:50:53.720
And there's God
distantly out there

00:50:53.720 --> 00:50:55.780
and looking
judgmentally at me as I

00:50:55.780 --> 00:50:57.430
strive to get up the mountain.

00:50:57.430 --> 00:50:58.990
Rather, God's like
in a helicopter

00:50:58.990 --> 00:51:02.470
who wants to land in
my heart, but there

00:51:02.470 --> 00:51:03.670
are obstacles in the way.

00:51:03.670 --> 00:51:05.380
There's stuff in the way.

00:51:05.380 --> 00:51:09.250
And I would say there's forms
of false worship in the way.

00:51:09.250 --> 00:51:12.760
Clear those out so the
helicopter can land.

00:51:12.760 --> 00:51:17.590
So it's like have the confidence
that God wants in my heart.

00:51:17.590 --> 00:51:19.510
That's all he wants.

00:51:19.510 --> 00:51:24.100
And if I just get out of the
way enough, it will happen.

00:51:24.100 --> 00:51:26.994
Now, everyone's got their
own hangups and problems

00:51:26.994 --> 00:51:28.160
that they have to deal with.

00:51:28.160 --> 00:51:30.730
But I think that's
a basic strategy.

00:51:33.277 --> 00:51:34.360
Please, Melissa, go ahead.

00:51:34.360 --> 00:51:36.484
MELISSA: So I think we'll
just do one more question

00:51:36.484 --> 00:51:38.200
from the Dory and one
more live question,

00:51:38.200 --> 00:51:39.430
and then we'll call it.

00:51:39.430 --> 00:51:43.520
So [? Louisa ?] [? Wolf ?]
from Mexico is asking,

00:51:43.520 --> 00:51:47.115
how do you see our role as
Catholic employees at Google?

00:51:47.115 --> 00:51:48.490
BISHOP ROBERT
BARRON: Well, she'd

00:51:48.490 --> 00:51:50.280
know better than I.
She's an employee.

00:51:50.280 --> 00:51:52.480
[LAUGHTER]

00:51:52.480 --> 00:51:55.720
You know, first of all, this.

00:51:55.720 --> 00:51:57.760
Be a person of love.

00:51:57.760 --> 00:51:59.170
Whatever you find yourself.

00:51:59.170 --> 00:52:01.540
I go with a little
flower, [FRENCH],,

00:52:01.540 --> 00:52:04.060
you know, her
so-called little way.

00:52:04.060 --> 00:52:07.690
Don't read that as something
kind of twee and sentimental.

00:52:07.690 --> 00:52:11.200
The little way means
in any situation,

00:52:11.200 --> 00:52:13.390
find the opportunity for love.

00:52:13.390 --> 00:52:14.890
And love, again,
is not a sentiment.

00:52:14.890 --> 00:52:16.810
It means willing the
good of the other.

00:52:16.810 --> 00:52:20.620
So wherever you are, in
whatever condition, you're sick,

00:52:20.620 --> 00:52:23.920
you're in prison, you're
at work, wherever you are,

00:52:23.920 --> 00:52:25.600
what's the path of love?

00:52:25.600 --> 00:52:27.670
Find it, and walk it.

00:52:27.670 --> 00:52:30.070
So that's what I'd say
to Catholics at Google,

00:52:30.070 --> 00:52:33.010
is walk the path of love
as fully as you can.

00:52:33.010 --> 00:52:35.110
But then you want
to press the thing,

00:52:35.110 --> 00:52:37.930
always be open, as we
hear in First Peter,

00:52:37.930 --> 00:52:40.300
to give a reason for
the hope that's in you.

00:52:40.300 --> 00:52:43.000
So if someone is curious
about your faith,

00:52:43.000 --> 00:52:46.410
your Catholicism, be
ready to provide answers.

00:52:46.410 --> 00:52:48.160
We're going through a
kind of a golden age

00:52:48.160 --> 00:52:49.804
right now of apologetics.

00:52:49.804 --> 00:52:51.470
I think it's because
of the new atheism.

00:52:51.470 --> 00:52:54.809
I think it awakened a lot
of religious people to we've

00:52:54.809 --> 00:52:56.350
got to defend
ourselves here and make

00:52:56.350 --> 00:52:58.427
the case to a skeptical public.

00:52:58.427 --> 00:53:00.260
So there's a lot of
good material out there.

00:53:00.260 --> 00:53:02.500
Learn it, so that when
people approach you,

00:53:02.500 --> 00:53:05.020
maybe, curiously, you have
something to say to them.

00:53:05.020 --> 00:53:06.220
So those two things.

00:53:06.220 --> 00:53:08.950
Love first, and then be
ready to give a reason

00:53:08.950 --> 00:53:10.110
for the hope that's in you.

00:53:13.050 --> 00:53:13.680
Please.

00:53:13.680 --> 00:53:14.221
AUDIENCE: Hi.

00:53:14.221 --> 00:53:15.920
Would you mind sharing
with us one way

00:53:15.920 --> 00:53:19.197
in which you've personally
experienced God in your life?

00:53:19.197 --> 00:53:20.030
ROBERT BARRON: Yeah.

00:53:20.030 --> 00:53:22.340
Well, I mean,
first and foremost,

00:53:22.340 --> 00:53:25.970
every day, when I say
mass is the most powerful.

00:53:25.970 --> 00:53:28.730
But I'll tell you,
when I was 14,

00:53:28.730 --> 00:53:32.030
it was hearing one of
Thomas Aquinas' arguments

00:53:32.030 --> 00:53:33.290
for God's existence.

00:53:33.290 --> 00:53:35.750
So I was a Catholic
kid going to mass,

00:53:35.750 --> 00:53:38.060
but I wasn't all that
interested in religion.

00:53:38.060 --> 00:53:39.620
And I was a freshman
in high school.

00:53:39.620 --> 00:53:41.960
And I see a Dominican
in the back of the room.

00:53:41.960 --> 00:53:44.870
A Dominican Friar in
our religion class

00:53:44.870 --> 00:53:47.326
laid out for us one
of Thomas's arguments.

00:53:47.326 --> 00:53:48.950
And honestly, I never
thought you could

00:53:48.950 --> 00:53:50.630
think about religion seriously.

00:53:50.630 --> 00:53:53.120
To me it was just like,
yeah, I go to mass on Sunday,

00:53:53.120 --> 00:53:55.970
but I never thought about
it until that moment.

00:53:55.970 --> 00:54:00.260
I thought, wow, that's a
very intriguing presentation.

00:54:00.260 --> 00:54:03.240
And it led me on this
quest that I'm still on.

00:54:03.240 --> 00:54:04.020
That's quite true.

00:54:04.020 --> 00:54:06.110
That was [MUMBLES] years ago.

00:54:06.110 --> 00:54:08.010
[LAUGHTER]

00:54:08.010 --> 00:54:09.630
But I've never left that path.

00:54:09.630 --> 00:54:11.300
And that's where
I really say God,

00:54:11.300 --> 00:54:13.250
and I look at it now
in a decisive way,

00:54:13.250 --> 00:54:16.910
kind of entered my life
and set me on a path

00:54:16.910 --> 00:54:19.205
that I'm still on,
standing before you today.

00:54:22.621 --> 00:54:23.120
Good.

00:54:23.120 --> 00:54:23.760
God bless you all.

00:54:23.760 --> 00:54:24.720
Thank you very much for coming.

00:54:24.720 --> 00:54:25.070
MELISSA: Thank you.

00:54:25.070 --> 00:54:26.069
SPEAKER: Thanks, Bishop.

00:54:26.069 --> 00:54:27.820
[APPLAUSE]
