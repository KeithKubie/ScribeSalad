00:00:00.080 --> 00:00:02.490
For this programming assignment, you needed to have rearranged the

00:00:02.490 --> 00:00:05.890
levels of the age.range variable, so that way, under 18 appeared

00:00:05.890 --> 00:00:08.830
first. One way to do this is to use the ordered

00:00:08.830 --> 00:00:13.430
function on the variable. We'll use the ordered function on age.range,

00:00:13.430 --> 00:00:15.800
and then we'll set the levels. I can run all

00:00:15.800 --> 00:00:18.320
this code to set the levels, and then, I can make

00:00:18.320 --> 00:00:22.140
my plot again. Pretty nice, huh? Another way to achieve the

00:00:22.140 --> 00:00:25.120
same result would be to use this code. Here, we're using

00:00:25.120 --> 00:00:29.310
the factor function. We're taking our age.range variable,

00:00:29.310 --> 00:00:31.710
setting the levels, and then making the order

00:00:31.710 --> 00:00:34.470
be true since we want these ordered. I'll

00:00:34.470 --> 00:00:36.700
run this code. And then, I'll make sure that

00:00:36.700 --> 00:00:40.150
the graph is the same output. And yes,

00:00:40.150 --> 00:00:43.830
it is. Now, if you want another challenge, try

00:00:43.830 --> 00:00:46.260
reordering the levels for the income range variable,

00:00:46.260 --> 00:00:48.040
and see if you can produce this same plot.
