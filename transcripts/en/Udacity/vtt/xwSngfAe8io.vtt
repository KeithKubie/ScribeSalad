00:00:00.300 --> 00:00:02.968
So, the teacher isn't getting
to pick questions anymore?

00:00:02.968 --> 00:00:05.530
&gt;&gt; No, the teacher's going to do,
the teacher is going to say,

00:00:05.530 --> 00:00:07.833
here's where I think the level
of understanding it.

00:00:07.833 --> 00:00:08.340
&gt;&gt; Kay.

00:00:08.340 --> 00:00:10.432
&gt;&gt; And then,
questions will be generated accordingly.

00:00:10.432 --> 00:00:11.970
&gt;&gt; Ooh, maybe from Gaussian.

00:00:11.970 --> 00:00:16.589
&gt;&gt; Maybe from a Gaussian, and in fact,
what I'm going to suggest we do is that

00:00:16.589 --> 00:00:19.184
we're going to say you
need to pick a line.

00:00:19.184 --> 00:00:21.470
Now, why should you pick
one line over the other?

00:00:21.470 --> 00:00:25.770
Because I'm going to set up
the incentive, so that you get plus one

00:00:27.080 --> 00:00:32.009
any time the learner answers correctly
something they should get wrong.

00:00:33.460 --> 00:00:37.420
&gt;&gt; But you also get plus
one when ever the student

00:00:37.420 --> 00:00:40.140
gets something incorrect
that they should get right.

00:00:40.140 --> 00:00:40.790
So, what does that mean?

00:00:40.790 --> 00:00:44.680
So, if you say, well, this is where
their level of understanding is,

00:00:44.680 --> 00:00:46.664
what you're really doing is you're
kind of picking two questions, right?

00:00:46.664 --> 00:00:49.930
You're you saying, look, this is a
question that they should get right and

00:00:49.930 --> 00:00:51.680
this is a question
they should get wrong.

00:00:51.680 --> 00:00:55.700
But if you actually identified where
their level of understanding is, then,

00:00:55.700 --> 00:00:58.452
sometimes they'll get some of these
things wrong that they should get right

00:00:58.452 --> 00:00:59.650
because they're easier, and

00:00:59.650 --> 00:01:02.110
sometimes they'll get right some of
the things that they should get wrong.

00:01:02.110 --> 00:01:03.410
Sort of set up the problem that way.

00:01:03.410 --> 00:01:03.930
&gt;&gt; Okay.
&gt;&gt; Right?

00:01:03.930 --> 00:01:05.610
And I'm going to get credit for that.

00:01:05.610 --> 00:01:06.230
&gt;&gt; You, the teacher.

00:01:06.230 --> 00:01:09.110
&gt;&gt; You, the teacher, I'm the teacher,
going to get credit for that.

00:01:09.110 --> 00:01:10.050
Well, let's see, what does that mean?

00:01:10.050 --> 00:01:14.520
Well, that means, in order for
that to work, I must have identified,

00:01:14.520 --> 00:01:18.385
more or less correctly, where your
level of understanding is as a learner.

00:01:18.385 --> 00:01:22.560
&gt;&gt; because if you set it too high,
the learner's always going to get things

00:01:22.560 --> 00:01:25.310
wrong, but there are things that
the learner should get wrong, so

00:01:25.310 --> 00:01:26.680
there's no points to the teacher.

00:01:27.740 --> 00:01:31.420
And if the teacher sets it too easy,
the bar down towards the bottom,

00:01:31.420 --> 00:01:33.840
then the learner's never
getting anything wrong.

00:01:33.840 --> 00:01:35.050
And when he gets things right,

00:01:35.050 --> 00:01:37.500
it's things that the learner
should get right.

00:01:37.500 --> 00:01:40.680
And again, should just means
below the bar set by the teacher.

00:01:40.680 --> 00:01:41.320
&gt;&gt; That's right.

00:01:41.320 --> 00:01:43.270
So, you'll get some
points by doing that, but

00:01:43.270 --> 00:01:46.700
you won't get as many as if you get
it right where they ought to be.

00:01:46.700 --> 00:01:50.919
&gt;&gt; So, the maximum comes when you've
done this 50-50 thing, right,

00:01:50.919 --> 00:01:55.073
where you're getting points for
the learner stretching a little bit and

00:01:55.073 --> 00:01:59.567
getting a little bit above and scoring
well, and you're getting points for,

00:01:59.567 --> 00:02:01.908
I guess tricking the student in a sense.

00:02:01.908 --> 00:02:05.121
&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] I wouldn't say tricking, what
you really is you're sort of testing

00:02:05.121 --> 00:02:07.163
where their understanding really is,
right?

00:02:07.163 --> 00:02:09.514
So, if it's the case that if
identified this correctly,

00:02:09.514 --> 00:02:12.443
will still get some things wrong,
we would think you would get right in,

00:02:12.443 --> 00:02:15.280
you'll get some things right that
we think you would get wrong.

00:02:15.280 --> 00:02:16.938
You really want to do it on both sides.

00:02:16.938 --> 00:02:21.427
And so,
if I move this line too far to one side,

00:02:21.427 --> 00:02:25.355
I only get points for
one side of the bar.

00:02:25.355 --> 00:02:28.828
If I move things this far, all the way
over to the right, I only get points for

00:02:28.828 --> 00:02:30.052
the other side of the bar.

00:02:30.052 --> 00:02:31.605
I want to get things for
both sides of the bar.

00:02:31.605 --> 00:02:33.700
&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.
&gt;&gt; So, that's only going to happen,

00:02:33.700 --> 00:02:37.540
if I can identify roughly where your
level of understanding actually is.

00:02:37.540 --> 00:02:38.570
&gt;&gt; That's clever.

00:02:38.570 --> 00:02:39.660
&gt;&gt; That is kind of clever.

00:02:39.660 --> 00:02:40.760
&gt;&gt; Did you come up with this?

00:02:40.760 --> 00:02:45.100
&gt;&gt; I came up with this by listening to a
guy named Jordan when he told me this is

00:02:45.100 --> 00:02:49.280
what he ended up doing with real
class of, I think, fifth graders.

00:02:49.280 --> 00:02:50.040
&gt;&gt; Interesting.

00:02:50.040 --> 00:02:51.620
&gt;&gt; Now, by the way,
there's something subtle here,

00:02:51.620 --> 00:02:52.910
we actually aren't finished with this.

00:02:52.910 --> 00:02:55.500
We just described this as
if it only happens once.

00:02:55.500 --> 00:02:58.290
Really, what we did is we spend our
time talking about the teacher, and that

00:02:58.290 --> 00:03:02.250
makes sense, because the teacher is this
complicated incentive function, right?

00:03:02.250 --> 00:03:04.018
So, the teacher's
going to get credit for

00:03:04.018 --> 00:03:06.780
basically identifying where
your level of understanding is.

00:03:06.780 --> 00:03:09.850
So, let's say I've done that, I know
where your level of understanding is.

00:03:09.850 --> 00:03:10.810
I put the line here.

00:03:10.810 --> 00:03:11.740
&gt;&gt; Good.

00:03:11.740 --> 00:03:15.260
&gt;&gt; What should you, what it's
going to happen for you as a learner.

00:03:15.260 --> 00:03:17.470
Your goal is still to
maximize your points.

00:03:17.470 --> 00:03:19.110
So, how do you maximize your points?

00:03:19.110 --> 00:03:21.350
&gt;&gt; Well, learner's perspective,
just try to always answer correctly.

00:03:21.350 --> 00:03:21.850
&gt;&gt; Right.

00:03:21.850 --> 00:03:25.670
So, how are you going to start answering
things correctly, getting more and

00:03:25.670 --> 00:03:27.140
more things right?

00:03:27.140 --> 00:03:27.950
&gt;&gt; By learning?

00:03:27.950 --> 00:03:32.050
&gt;&gt; By learning, by actually moving
your actual bar to the right.

00:03:32.050 --> 00:03:32.610
&gt;&gt; I see.

00:03:32.610 --> 00:03:35.300
&gt;&gt; Because then, you will not
get these things wrong anymore,

00:03:35.300 --> 00:03:37.450
and you will get these things right.

00:03:37.450 --> 00:03:40.290
And so, you will increase
the number of points that you get.

00:03:40.290 --> 00:03:40.970
&gt;&gt; Got it.
&gt;&gt; So

00:03:40.970 --> 00:03:46.250
then, this will cause you to learn more
so that you can get more things right.

00:03:46.250 --> 00:03:48.055
And then,
what's going to happen to the teacher?

00:03:48.055 --> 00:03:49.780
&gt;&gt; Teacher's going to be unhappy, but

00:03:49.780 --> 00:03:51.760
the teacher could move
the bar to the right.

00:03:51.760 --> 00:03:52.832
&gt;&gt; Right.

00:03:52.832 --> 00:03:54.920
&gt;&gt; To kind of catch up to
where you actually are.

00:03:54.920 --> 00:03:58.160
&gt;&gt; Right, so the learner is
incentivized to learn, and the teacher

00:03:58.160 --> 00:04:02.240
is incentivized to understand really
what the learner has learned.

00:04:02.240 --> 00:04:06.070
And they will keep pushing each other
until you've learned everything.

00:04:06.070 --> 00:04:08.750
&gt;&gt; Ooh, and then,
no one has any incentives anymore.

00:04:08.750 --> 00:04:09.863
&gt;&gt; Yeah, but at that point,
you know everything.

00:04:09.863 --> 00:04:11.926
And you're a teenager.

00:04:11.926 --> 00:04:16.110
&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Well, I was just
worried about this case where, so

00:04:16.110 --> 00:04:19.360
then the learner feigns ignorance for
a little while so the teacher can

00:04:19.360 --> 00:04:23.320
move the bar down, and then, starts
getting things right and wrong again.

00:04:23.320 --> 00:04:25.340
Yeah, I don't know,
I guess that's not really a concern.

00:04:25.340 --> 00:04:26.250
&gt;&gt; Yeah, I don't think so.

00:04:26.250 --> 00:04:27.500
&gt;&gt; Okay.
&gt;&gt; And even if it is,

00:04:27.500 --> 00:04:29.040
the teacher will immediately
figure this out, and

00:04:29.040 --> 00:04:31.690
the learner will be giving
up points in the meantime.

00:04:31.690 --> 00:04:34.100
&gt;&gt; Yeah.
&gt;&gt; It's not really the maximal policy.

00:04:34.100 --> 00:04:37.180
I mean you'd have to
get it exactly right.

00:04:37.180 --> 00:04:37.770
&gt;&gt; Right.

00:04:37.770 --> 00:04:39.530
It's just that once the learners
learned everything,

00:04:39.530 --> 00:04:41.030
the teacher has no incentive anymore.

00:04:41.030 --> 00:04:43.260
&gt;&gt; Sure, but then once the learners
learn everything, then you're done.
