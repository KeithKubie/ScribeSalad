00:00:00.395 --> 00:00:03.895
(upbeat electronic music)

00:00:10.060 --> 00:00:11.380
- Hello and welcome.

00:00:11.380 --> 00:00:12.530
My name is Charlotte Hill.

00:00:12.530 --> 00:00:15.120
I'm a Ph.D. student here at UC Berkeley.

00:00:15.120 --> 00:00:17.840
And I'm here with
professor of public policy

00:00:17.840 --> 00:00:20.320
and political science Sarah Anzia

00:00:20.320 --> 00:00:23.450
and the former governor of
Michigan Jennifer Granholm,

00:00:23.450 --> 00:00:26.370
who's also a professor
here at UC Berkeley.

00:00:26.370 --> 00:00:27.520
Welcome thanks for joining us.

00:00:27.520 --> 00:00:29.300
- Thanks.
- Thank you for having us.

00:00:29.300 --> 00:00:33.810
- So 2018 was an incredible year for women

00:00:33.810 --> 00:00:36.493
at the ballot box.
- Woo hoo!

00:00:36.493 --> 00:00:38.500
(chuckles)
- We saw an unprecedented

00:00:38.500 --> 00:00:42.680
number of women getting
elected to the U.S. Congress.

00:00:42.680 --> 00:00:45.700
And it seems like there's
something different this year,

00:00:45.700 --> 00:00:47.700
compared to past elections.

00:00:47.700 --> 00:00:51.470
But it's not totally clear,
from an outsider's perspective,

00:00:51.470 --> 00:00:53.300
what it is that is different.

00:00:53.300 --> 00:00:55.380
Is it just that more women were running?

00:00:55.380 --> 00:00:58.310
Is it that women were
running campaigns that were

00:00:58.310 --> 00:01:00.240
qualitatively different from campaigns

00:01:00.240 --> 00:01:02.160
that had been run in the past?

00:01:02.160 --> 00:01:04.250
Could either of you
shed some light on that?

00:01:04.250 --> 00:01:05.960
Maybe Sarah.
- Sure.

00:01:05.960 --> 00:01:08.060
Well I think the really big story

00:01:08.060 --> 00:01:12.180
was the record numbers
of women running for

00:01:12.180 --> 00:01:15.980
particularly U.S. House and
specifically, Democratic women.

00:01:15.980 --> 00:01:19.490
I think prior to this year, the record for

00:01:19.490 --> 00:01:21.840
Democratic women running for office,

00:01:21.840 --> 00:01:25.860
running for U.S. House, was
something like 190 back in 2012.

00:01:25.860 --> 00:01:29.170
And this past election, it was over 350

00:01:29.170 --> 00:01:30.440
filed to become candidates.

00:01:30.440 --> 00:01:32.970
It's a huge jump from the record.

00:01:32.970 --> 00:01:36.470
And then on top of that,
they did really well.

00:01:36.470 --> 00:01:37.830
Women won their primary.

00:01:37.830 --> 00:01:40.430
Democratic women won their primaries

00:01:40.430 --> 00:01:42.080
at higher rates than any other group.

00:01:42.080 --> 00:01:44.110
And so what you had was a record number

00:01:44.110 --> 00:01:45.720
of Democratic nominees who were women,

00:01:45.720 --> 00:01:48.070
43 percent or something like that.

00:01:48.070 --> 00:01:49.900
And I guess the other notable thing is,

00:01:49.900 --> 00:01:52.890
this did not happen on
the Republican side.

00:01:52.890 --> 00:01:54.910
The numbers of Republican women

00:01:54.910 --> 00:01:56.270
running for House were pretty much.

00:01:56.270 --> 00:01:58.110
They looked like they had before.

00:01:58.110 --> 00:02:01.120
So this was definitely
just an amazing year

00:02:01.120 --> 00:02:03.747
for Democratic women in
particular, running for office.

00:02:03.747 --> 00:02:06.530
- There's another piece of information

00:02:06.530 --> 00:02:08.390
which I think is such a great anecdote

00:02:08.390 --> 00:02:11.670
about the enthusiasm on
the part of women to run.

00:02:11.670 --> 00:02:14.160
'Cause normally, prior to this year,

00:02:14.160 --> 00:02:16.700
you used to really have
to persuade women to run.

00:02:16.700 --> 00:02:18.720
You had to ask them five times et cetera.

00:02:18.720 --> 00:02:20.910
Emily's List, who of
course helps pro-choice

00:02:20.910 --> 00:02:24.690
Democratic women, this past cycle.

00:02:24.690 --> 00:02:29.160
So in a normal cycle, in the
cycle before this past one,

00:02:29.160 --> 00:02:32.620
they had about 900 women
who had raised their hand

00:02:32.620 --> 00:02:34.930
and had approached them
and said, "I wanna run."

00:02:34.930 --> 00:02:38.500
In this cycle, so 900
last time, in this cycle,

00:02:38.500 --> 00:02:41.530
42,000 women.
(exclaims)

00:02:41.530 --> 00:02:43.650
Does that give you goosebumps or what?

00:02:43.650 --> 00:02:46.700
So there is something
qualitatively different

00:02:46.700 --> 00:02:50.250
about what has happened between
the last cycle and this one.

00:02:50.250 --> 00:02:54.570
And it has caused more
women voters to step up.

00:02:54.570 --> 00:02:57.560
And it's caused more
women to run for office.

00:02:57.560 --> 00:02:59.640
So the question is, what is it?

00:02:59.640 --> 00:03:02.270
And obviously, we got a big
answer in the White House

00:03:02.270 --> 00:03:04.490
because it is largely Democratic women.

00:03:04.490 --> 00:03:09.490
People are angry and feel
empowered to take our nation back,

00:03:09.720 --> 00:03:13.090
feel like perhaps they have
a responsibility to do that.

00:03:13.090 --> 00:03:15.320
And so that Women's March

00:03:15.320 --> 00:03:18.010
and the millions of women who participated

00:03:18.010 --> 00:03:19.590
in 600 marches across the country,

00:03:19.590 --> 00:03:22.600
all of that sort of was the initial fuel.

00:03:22.600 --> 00:03:24.487
And then after that, women felt like,

00:03:24.487 --> 00:03:26.247
"Heck yes, this is my country.

00:03:26.247 --> 00:03:27.877
"I'm not just going to sit back

00:03:27.877 --> 00:03:30.037
"and allow others to
make decisions for me.

00:03:30.037 --> 00:03:33.640
"I am gonna take a participatory role."

00:03:33.640 --> 00:03:34.473
So that was super exciting,

00:03:34.473 --> 00:03:36.730
I think a really important catalyst

00:03:36.730 --> 00:03:38.140
in addition to probably some other things

00:03:38.140 --> 00:03:39.210
that you probably have ideas on.

00:03:39.210 --> 00:03:41.100
- Well I mean, this is just anecdotal.

00:03:41.100 --> 00:03:43.610
But there were a number of accounts of

00:03:43.610 --> 00:03:46.850
primary campaign ads also
that looked different

00:03:46.850 --> 00:03:47.910
than they had in the past.

00:03:47.910 --> 00:03:51.750
You had women running as women

00:03:51.750 --> 00:03:53.630
rather than following
sort of the old playbook,

00:03:53.630 --> 00:03:58.250
so campaign ads showing
women breastfeeding

00:03:58.250 --> 00:04:00.010
or talking about sexual assault

00:04:00.010 --> 00:04:02.620
or people bringing their kids along.

00:04:02.620 --> 00:04:04.740
So that seemed, again
this is purely anecdotal,

00:04:04.740 --> 00:04:06.638
but it seemed like a
shift this time around.

00:04:06.638 --> 00:04:09.520
- Okay so in Michigan, this
is just one classic example.

00:04:09.520 --> 00:04:11.990
The woman who ran for
Attorney General of Michigan,

00:04:11.990 --> 00:04:13.360
her name was Dana Nessel.

00:04:13.360 --> 00:04:15.670
She had a minute-long introductory ad,

00:04:15.670 --> 00:04:17.880
and this is what her ad was basically.

00:04:17.880 --> 00:04:19.950
Vote, this is not censored.

00:04:19.950 --> 00:04:22.923
Vote for the one without the penis.

00:04:22.923 --> 00:04:24.010
I'm not kidding you.

00:04:24.010 --> 00:04:24.843
That was her ad.

00:04:24.843 --> 00:04:27.153
And she won, like significantly.

00:04:29.050 --> 00:04:31.030
She ran as a woman.

00:04:31.030 --> 00:04:33.240
Obviously you have to run
as woman if you are a woman.

00:04:33.240 --> 00:04:36.140
But your point about in previous times,

00:04:36.140 --> 00:04:36.990
yeah you were told.

00:04:36.990 --> 00:04:39.047
I was told, "Don't even show your children

00:04:39.047 --> 00:04:41.247
"because people don't
wanna be thinking about

00:04:41.247 --> 00:04:44.250
"whether you will be
capable of being in office."

00:04:44.250 --> 00:04:47.550
But this time, totally authentic ads

00:04:47.550 --> 00:04:50.060
that had women showing who they were,

00:04:50.060 --> 00:04:54.000
women fighter pilots, women
with their families et cetera.

00:04:54.000 --> 00:04:57.350
It was so refreshing and authentic.

00:04:57.350 --> 00:05:00.810
And that I think is the
gift that this past cycle

00:05:00.810 --> 00:05:03.230
has given to us, is this notion that

00:05:03.230 --> 00:05:06.170
you can be imperfect and use some.

00:05:06.170 --> 00:05:07.830
Not that being a woman is imperfect.

00:05:07.830 --> 00:05:09.860
But you can use some of your challenges

00:05:09.860 --> 00:05:14.210
as a way to have people relate to you,

00:05:14.210 --> 00:05:15.120
obviously being a woman.

00:05:15.120 --> 00:05:16.870
But I think of Stacey Abrams,

00:05:16.870 --> 00:05:19.200
who ran for governor of Georgia.

00:05:19.200 --> 00:05:23.440
She had some issues with
some finances in the past,

00:05:23.440 --> 00:05:24.880
some loans et cetera.

00:05:24.880 --> 00:05:26.557
And she used that as a way to say,

00:05:26.557 --> 00:05:27.637
"I am not the only one.

00:05:27.637 --> 00:05:29.737
"I am somebody who went to Yale et cetera,

00:05:29.737 --> 00:05:30.980
"and I'm having problems."

00:05:30.980 --> 00:05:33.230
So what is their average citizen having?

00:05:33.230 --> 00:05:34.700
So all of that is to say

00:05:34.700 --> 00:05:37.180
that authentic challenge and struggle

00:05:37.180 --> 00:05:40.650
and laying it out there is
I think a real difference.

00:05:40.650 --> 00:05:42.440
- So why do we think this matters,

00:05:42.440 --> 00:05:47.030
to have women versus men holding office?

00:05:47.030 --> 00:05:49.390
Clearly it matters for
descriptive representation,

00:05:49.390 --> 00:05:50.630
for young women to grow up

00:05:50.630 --> 00:05:53.590
seeing people who look
like them in office.

00:05:53.590 --> 00:05:56.740
Are there other ways
that women legislators

00:05:56.740 --> 00:05:58.830
govern differently or
legislate differently?

00:05:58.830 --> 00:05:59.663
- Didn't you do some
research on that? (chuckles)

00:05:59.663 --> 00:06:02.973
- Yeah well, and I think it
can easily be misrepresented.

00:06:04.008 --> 00:06:06.720
I have an article I published a while back

00:06:06.720 --> 00:06:09.770
with Chris Berry at
University of Chicago where

00:06:09.770 --> 00:06:12.610
we show evidence that in Congress,

00:06:12.610 --> 00:06:15.870
the female legislators
appear to outperform

00:06:15.870 --> 00:06:19.300
the male legislators
in bringing money back

00:06:19.300 --> 00:06:22.220
to their districts, in sponsoring
and cosponsoring bills.

00:06:22.220 --> 00:06:23.053
They're doing more.

00:06:23.053 --> 00:06:25.070
And there's actually
new work by Sarah Fulton

00:06:25.070 --> 00:06:27.260
suggesting that women are also doing more

00:06:27.260 --> 00:06:29.887
constituency service, more casework.

00:06:29.887 --> 00:06:32.530
Now before you take that
and draw conclusions,

00:06:32.530 --> 00:06:35.980
the explanation appears to be that

00:06:35.980 --> 00:06:38.190
in the past, it has been more difficult

00:06:38.190 --> 00:06:40.180
for women to have the same success

00:06:40.180 --> 00:06:41.530
in getting elected to office.

00:06:41.530 --> 00:06:43.540
And so to get the same vote share,

00:06:43.540 --> 00:06:46.100
to get the same support from voters,

00:06:46.100 --> 00:06:48.280
women on average had to be a bit better.

00:06:48.280 --> 00:06:51.250
And so when you look at the
pool of people who are elected,

00:06:51.250 --> 00:06:55.430
the women on average are
outperforming the men.

00:06:55.430 --> 00:06:59.810
But in addition to that,
there is a lot of research

00:06:59.810 --> 00:07:04.650
suggesting that female legislators
are more collaborative,

00:07:04.650 --> 00:07:06.200
perhaps more bipartisan,

00:07:06.200 --> 00:07:08.183
that they prioritize different issues.

00:07:09.950 --> 00:07:13.560
They're pushing policies
supportive of women and families,

00:07:13.560 --> 00:07:16.340
social welfare, civil
rights, health, education.

00:07:16.340 --> 00:07:17.980
And there are some clear differences there

00:07:17.980 --> 00:07:20.200
in terms of the policies they push.

00:07:20.200 --> 00:07:21.900
- We certainly saw Hillary Clinton

00:07:21.900 --> 00:07:25.250
champion early childhood education

00:07:25.250 --> 00:07:27.400
child care for working parents

00:07:27.400 --> 00:07:30.390
in her presidential campaign in 2016.

00:07:30.390 --> 00:07:32.420
Can we expect to see some of those issues

00:07:32.420 --> 00:07:35.150
staying at the top of
the policy priority list

00:07:35.150 --> 00:07:36.920
in the 2020 presidential campaign?

00:07:36.920 --> 00:07:37.753
- Oh I think so.

00:07:37.753 --> 00:07:38.683
I think totally.

00:07:39.670 --> 00:07:44.060
Women's issues have been sort of relegated

00:07:44.060 --> 00:07:48.350
as the second tier of issues because

00:07:48.350 --> 00:07:50.099
a woman is the one who bears children.

00:07:50.099 --> 00:07:51.040
A woman is the one who is

00:07:51.040 --> 00:07:53.310
primarily responsible in many cases.

00:07:53.310 --> 00:07:58.310
However in an environment
where women are at the table

00:07:59.110 --> 00:08:01.936
and insisting that these
are women's issues.

00:08:01.936 --> 00:08:03.286
Yes but these are children's issues,

00:08:03.286 --> 00:08:06.470
and children are male and female.

00:08:06.470 --> 00:08:08.420
And this should be an issue for all of us.

00:08:08.420 --> 00:08:09.820
And so I think what you're seeing,

00:08:09.820 --> 00:08:12.250
for example even in California,
you have a male governor

00:08:12.250 --> 00:08:14.160
who's pushing parental leave,

00:08:14.160 --> 00:08:15.680
six month parental leave policies.

00:08:15.680 --> 00:08:18.364
He's pushing universal preschool.

00:08:18.364 --> 00:08:19.600
And that's awesome.

00:08:19.600 --> 00:08:22.110
I think largely because Millennial men

00:08:22.110 --> 00:08:24.200
and younger men who are coming up

00:08:24.200 --> 00:08:26.270
understand the importance of

00:08:26.270 --> 00:08:28.240
making sure that policy is inclusive

00:08:28.240 --> 00:08:30.760
and helps the family move forward.

00:08:30.760 --> 00:08:33.510
So those have historically
been women's issues.

00:08:33.510 --> 00:08:35.190
Hopefully they are women.

00:08:35.190 --> 00:08:39.010
They should be women and men's issues.

00:08:39.010 --> 00:08:43.320
But I do think that just on
the process side, women are,

00:08:43.320 --> 00:08:45.450
just anecdotally again.

00:08:45.450 --> 00:08:48.750
I have found that women are
really quite collaborative.

00:08:48.750 --> 00:08:51.930
So when I had the hardest
pieces of legislation

00:08:51.930 --> 00:08:54.290
to push through, I had a Republican House

00:08:54.290 --> 00:08:55.770
and a Republican Senate.

00:08:55.770 --> 00:08:57.320
So I needed to work in a bipartisan way.

00:08:57.320 --> 00:08:59.400
So whenever I had something
that was really tough,

00:08:59.400 --> 00:09:01.220
there was a Democratic woman in the House

00:09:01.220 --> 00:09:02.600
and a Republican woman in the Senate

00:09:02.600 --> 00:09:04.890
that I would ask to work together on it.

00:09:04.890 --> 00:09:09.050
And those two would do all
of the consultative work

00:09:09.050 --> 00:09:10.890
that was needed for
the constituency groups

00:09:10.890 --> 00:09:12.390
to make this happen et cetera.

00:09:13.395 --> 00:09:17.630
They were by far and away the
most effective legislators,

00:09:17.630 --> 00:09:21.560
Patty Birkholz, Representative Warren.

00:09:21.560 --> 00:09:24.920
They were the ones who got
the hardest stuff through

00:09:24.920 --> 00:09:25.880
because they could.

00:09:25.880 --> 00:09:28.890
And they were not seen as
threatening for whatever reason.

00:09:28.890 --> 00:09:30.473
- That's really interesting.

00:09:30.473 --> 00:09:33.435
You mentioned Jennifer that

00:09:33.435 --> 00:09:36.910
there had been a shift
after President Trump's

00:09:36.910 --> 00:09:40.610
2016 election in the
mobilization and activation

00:09:40.610 --> 00:09:44.020
of women at the grassroots
level, women voters.

00:09:44.020 --> 00:09:45.694
Can you speak a little more about that?

00:09:45.694 --> 00:09:49.250
How has that activism landscape changed?

00:09:49.250 --> 00:09:50.083
- Oh it's awesome.

00:09:50.083 --> 00:09:51.190
I mean look at all of these groups

00:09:51.190 --> 00:09:54.700
that have been born since
Donald Trump was elected.

00:09:54.700 --> 00:09:56.820
I guess that's the silver
lining for our democracy

00:09:56.820 --> 00:09:58.790
is that he's really energized a huge

00:09:58.790 --> 00:10:00.520
amount of participation.

00:10:00.520 --> 00:10:03.480
And so whether it's Swing
Left or Sister District

00:10:03.480 --> 00:10:08.400
or Indivisible, there's
just a plethora of groups,

00:10:08.400 --> 00:10:09.990
a lot of them focused on women.

00:10:09.990 --> 00:10:13.200
Here in the Bay area,
there's a group called Emerge

00:10:13.200 --> 00:10:15.510
that really helps women to become elected.

00:10:15.510 --> 00:10:17.460
And they have spread across the country.

00:10:17.460 --> 00:10:20.360
And they, like Emily's
List, were seeing this huge

00:10:20.360 --> 00:10:23.438
uptick in women who were
raising their hand to say,

00:10:23.438 --> 00:10:25.117
(claps hands)
"I am in.

00:10:25.117 --> 00:10:28.487
"I am interested in running
and saving my community

00:10:28.487 --> 00:10:29.670
"in some way shape or form."

00:10:29.670 --> 00:10:31.261
And it wasn't just Congress.

00:10:31.261 --> 00:10:34.060
This happened up and down the ballot.

00:10:34.060 --> 00:10:36.250
In Michigan, we had a
woman elected as governor,

00:10:36.250 --> 00:10:38.760
a woman elected as Attorney General,

00:10:38.760 --> 00:10:40.390
a woman elected as Secretary of State.

00:10:40.390 --> 00:10:42.906
We took back too congressional
seats that were both women.

00:10:42.906 --> 00:10:46.730
I mean it was really an all-female year

00:10:46.730 --> 00:10:47.790
which was fantastic.

00:10:47.790 --> 00:10:49.740
And it wasn't just
Michigan as an anecdote.

00:10:49.740 --> 00:10:51.930
So I think that the President has been

00:10:51.930 --> 00:10:54.070
an incredible motivator.

00:10:54.070 --> 00:10:58.240
But ultimately on the
ground, it may be the spark

00:10:58.240 --> 00:10:59.980
that got people to raise their hand.

00:10:59.980 --> 00:11:02.010
But in real communities
across the country,

00:11:02.010 --> 00:11:02.970
it really was health care.

00:11:02.970 --> 00:11:05.270
And I think women are a trusted deliverer

00:11:05.270 --> 00:11:08.020
of the message of the
importance of health care,

00:11:08.020 --> 00:11:08.853
not that men aren't.

00:11:08.853 --> 00:11:09.940
Men are as well.

00:11:09.940 --> 00:11:13.000
But I think that women
embody that, whether it's.

00:11:13.000 --> 00:11:14.410
It's not just reproductive freedom,

00:11:14.410 --> 00:11:16.390
but that's one of the
aspects of health care

00:11:16.390 --> 00:11:19.210
that I think people are energized about,

00:11:19.210 --> 00:11:21.220
women are energized about.

00:11:21.220 --> 00:11:24.500
So I think women took advantage of

00:11:24.500 --> 00:11:26.130
both Trump in the White House

00:11:26.130 --> 00:11:28.750
as well as Trump's expressed desire

00:11:28.750 --> 00:11:30.220
to kill the Affordable Care Act,

00:11:30.220 --> 00:11:31.667
to say, "No no no no no,

00:11:31.667 --> 00:11:32.617
"We're gonna stop that.

00:11:32.617 --> 00:11:34.810
"This is too important
for people on the ground."

00:11:34.810 --> 00:11:38.110
- I mean I think one,
just the turnout in 2018--

00:11:38.110 --> 00:11:40.250
- Yeah historic.
- just blew me away.

00:11:40.250 --> 00:11:42.800
I give a lecture every year about.

00:11:42.800 --> 00:11:44.440
I talk about the seesaw pattern

00:11:44.440 --> 00:11:47.090
in midterm and presidential
election turnout.

00:11:47.090 --> 00:11:50.740
In a typical midterm, it's
40 percent of eligible voters

00:11:50.740 --> 00:11:51.960
participating typically.

00:11:51.960 --> 00:11:54.250
It was something like
50, close to 50 percent.

00:11:54.250 --> 00:11:55.640
This is a huge uptick.

00:11:55.640 --> 00:11:56.840
It looked more like a
presidential election.

00:11:56.840 --> 00:11:57.950
- Not quite presidential but close.

00:11:57.950 --> 00:12:00.110
- Exactly and so somethin's.

00:12:00.110 --> 00:12:01.160
That is really different.

00:12:01.160 --> 00:12:02.930
I think compared to the midterms

00:12:02.930 --> 00:12:05.600
in the last hundred years,
this just stands out

00:12:05.600 --> 00:12:06.590
as a huge event.

00:12:06.590 --> 00:12:09.620
- And I think what was striking about it

00:12:09.620 --> 00:12:12.940
was the number, particularly of

00:12:12.940 --> 00:12:16.920
suburban college-educated
women, who came out to

00:12:16.920 --> 00:12:17.753
flip the House.

00:12:17.753 --> 00:12:20.173
I mean really, they flipped the House.

00:12:22.160 --> 00:12:24.450
Women of color, African
American women in particular,

00:12:24.450 --> 00:12:27.260
are clearly such a strong
base for the Democrats

00:12:27.260 --> 00:12:28.093
on making that.

00:12:28.093 --> 00:12:29.700
But when you can add to that

00:12:29.700 --> 00:12:34.010
by including women who
had perhaps even in 2016

00:12:34.010 --> 00:12:35.500
voted for Donald Trump

00:12:35.500 --> 00:12:37.310
and who had aligned with the Republicans

00:12:37.310 --> 00:12:38.757
and who said, "Enough is enough.

00:12:38.757 --> 00:12:41.027
"This is just too much to bear.

00:12:41.027 --> 00:12:43.130
"I've got to get out and
help save my community."

00:12:43.130 --> 00:12:44.997
That I think was a real
contributor to that.

00:12:44.997 --> 00:12:46.530
- So that's really interesting.

00:12:46.530 --> 00:12:50.770
Four in 10 women still identify
with the Republican party,

00:12:50.770 --> 00:12:52.550
either by calling themselves Republicans

00:12:52.550 --> 00:12:55.160
or saying they lean toward
the Republican party.

00:12:55.160 --> 00:12:59.510
And yet we see certain issues that seem to

00:12:59.510 --> 00:13:02.319
mobilize women on both sides,

00:13:02.319 --> 00:13:05.610
regardless of their partisan slant.

00:13:05.610 --> 00:13:08.210
So do you think that
there's an opportunity

00:13:08.210 --> 00:13:12.280
for women to kinda come
together as a voting block,

00:13:12.280 --> 00:13:14.730
as an issue-focused voting block

00:13:14.730 --> 00:13:16.750
in 2020 and moving forward

00:13:16.750 --> 00:13:20.440
and bypass some of the partisan politics?

00:13:20.440 --> 00:13:21.500
- Maybe a little bit,

00:13:21.500 --> 00:13:23.210
but I wouldn't be too optimistic there.

00:13:23.210 --> 00:13:25.290
I mean so most Republican women

00:13:25.290 --> 00:13:27.550
still wanted to confirm Judge Kavanaugh.

00:13:27.550 --> 00:13:30.960
So their partisanship
is still a huge factor.

00:13:30.960 --> 00:13:34.910
And the shifts we saw in
particularly white women

00:13:36.170 --> 00:13:40.930
between 2016 and 2018 were significant.

00:13:40.930 --> 00:13:43.120
So something like 53
percent of white women

00:13:43.120 --> 00:13:46.560
voted for Donald Trump in 2016.

00:13:46.560 --> 00:13:49.580
It looks like there was an increase

00:13:49.580 --> 00:13:51.800
in the share of white
women voting for Democrats

00:13:51.800 --> 00:13:54.179
for House this past election,
something like 49 percent

00:13:54.179 --> 00:13:56.410
of Democrat white women.

00:13:56.410 --> 00:13:58.420
But at the same time, that's not.

00:13:58.420 --> 00:14:00.910
It's big because the numbers are big.

00:14:00.910 --> 00:14:04.490
But partisanship is still
gonna be a huge divider there.

00:14:04.490 --> 00:14:07.170
And I think that we can't
talk about women as a block

00:14:07.170 --> 00:14:08.003
for that reason.

00:14:08.003 --> 00:14:10.760
They're not a voting; they
don't vote as a block.

00:14:10.760 --> 00:14:15.210
- I would say I have
a little more optimism

00:14:15.210 --> 00:14:18.110
than you do, only because of the

00:14:18.990 --> 00:14:22.150
unprecedented nature I
think of this presidency.

00:14:22.150 --> 00:14:26.120
He's so sui generisant,
causes such reaction.

00:14:26.120 --> 00:14:28.870
But particularly among Independents,

00:14:28.870 --> 00:14:31.310
obviously that middle block is so huge.

00:14:31.310 --> 00:14:35.130
And like 59 percent of the
Independents voted Democratic,

00:14:35.130 --> 00:14:36.330
or maybe it was 56 percent.

00:14:36.330 --> 00:14:38.490
But nonetheless, it was a big block.

00:14:38.490 --> 00:14:40.420
And a lot of those women,

00:14:40.420 --> 00:14:42.860
a lot of those were women, suburban women.

00:14:42.860 --> 00:14:44.520
So I do think.

00:14:44.520 --> 00:14:47.020
I mean historically, I'd
be curious about your

00:14:47.020 --> 00:14:48.910
position on this Sarah.

00:14:48.910 --> 00:14:52.680
Historically white women
have voted Republican.

00:14:52.680 --> 00:14:56.150
And white women have seen, have often.

00:14:56.150 --> 00:15:00.430
White Republican women have
aligned themselves behind

00:15:00.430 --> 00:15:02.170
the patriarchy if you will,

00:15:02.170 --> 00:15:04.560
taken cover by the patriarchy.

00:15:04.560 --> 00:15:06.420
But I am seeing.

00:15:06.420 --> 00:15:08.440
And perhaps it's just anecdotally,

00:15:08.440 --> 00:15:09.930
and perhaps it's just 'cause
I'm in the mix on this.

00:15:09.930 --> 00:15:13.330
But I am seeing so much alignment between

00:15:13.330 --> 00:15:15.440
white women and women of color

00:15:15.440 --> 00:15:17.950
as opposed to white women and white men.

00:15:17.950 --> 00:15:21.110
So there seems to be a real push about,

00:15:21.110 --> 00:15:22.120
we're all in this together,

00:15:22.120 --> 00:15:24.860
and we've got to team up

00:15:24.860 --> 00:15:26.022
to be able to make an impact.

00:15:26.022 --> 00:15:29.150
- I mean I agree there's
definitely been a shift,

00:15:29.150 --> 00:15:30.400
a perceptible shift.

00:15:30.400 --> 00:15:32.910
How far it will go I am not quite sure.

00:15:32.910 --> 00:15:33.803
I am not sure.

00:15:35.140 --> 00:15:38.380
Polarization is at its peak.

00:15:38.380 --> 00:15:39.930
And well we don't know.

00:15:39.930 --> 00:15:43.870
But it's difficult to say how
much unification you can get

00:15:43.870 --> 00:15:45.450
under the women umbrella

00:15:45.450 --> 00:15:47.940
with that, with the degree of polarization

00:15:47.940 --> 00:15:48.900
and partisanship we have now.

00:15:48.900 --> 00:15:50.080
But we'll see.

00:15:50.080 --> 00:15:51.480
We will see.

00:15:51.480 --> 00:15:54.140
- So let's talk a little
bit about the media.

00:15:54.140 --> 00:15:57.230
In the 2016 presidential election,

00:15:57.230 --> 00:15:59.860
there was certainly a lot of talk about

00:15:59.860 --> 00:16:01.890
Hillary Clinton being covered differently

00:16:01.890 --> 00:16:03.960
by the media than Donald Trump

00:16:03.960 --> 00:16:06.963
and even Bernie Sanders on the left.

00:16:07.860 --> 00:16:10.660
And now moving into the
2020 presidential election,

00:16:10.660 --> 00:16:13.100
which is already right around the corner,

00:16:13.100 --> 00:16:17.170
we can expect to have
probably four at least

00:16:17.170 --> 00:16:21.680
female Democratic
contenders for that race.

00:16:21.680 --> 00:16:24.640
Should we expect that
media coverage will be

00:16:24.640 --> 00:16:26.430
similar of those candidates

00:16:26.430 --> 00:16:28.230
as it was of Hillary Clinton?

00:16:28.230 --> 00:16:30.280
Do you think journalists
have learned anything?

00:16:30.280 --> 00:16:32.420
- Right I mean the minute Elizabeth Warren

00:16:32.420 --> 00:16:35.130
announced that she had formed
an exploratory committee

00:16:35.130 --> 00:16:37.910
and she was getting in, you
saw a headline from Politico

00:16:37.910 --> 00:16:41.407
saying, "Is She Facing
The Liability Factor

00:16:41.407 --> 00:16:43.460
"That Hillary Clinton Faced?"

00:16:43.460 --> 00:16:45.200
which is what you're alluding to.

00:16:45.200 --> 00:16:47.040
I think the media has a role to play

00:16:47.040 --> 00:16:48.760
in checking their biases at the door.

00:16:48.760 --> 00:16:50.200
There's clearly about that.

00:16:50.200 --> 00:16:52.660
I think women who are running know this.

00:16:52.660 --> 00:16:54.600
It is clear that women,

00:16:54.600 --> 00:16:57.490
that voters expect women
to be more likable,

00:16:57.490 --> 00:16:58.870
whether that's fair or not.

00:16:58.870 --> 00:16:59.830
Obviously it's not fair.

00:16:59.830 --> 00:17:01.160
We never asked that about

00:17:01.160 --> 00:17:03.180
the very unlikeable President
of the United States.

00:17:03.180 --> 00:17:06.990
But anyway, we don't expect
the same thing of men.

00:17:06.990 --> 00:17:08.850
But what I say to women who are in it.

00:17:08.850 --> 00:17:10.390
Look it, you're gonna face biases.

00:17:10.390 --> 00:17:12.400
It just is part of the deal.

00:17:12.400 --> 00:17:16.940
So as Ann Richards said when
she was governor of Texas,

00:17:16.940 --> 00:17:18.840
and it's alluding to the
whole thing you were saying

00:17:18.840 --> 00:17:20.010
about women in state legislatures,

00:17:20.010 --> 00:17:23.020
the old saw that women have to do.

00:17:23.020 --> 00:17:25.190
Women can do everything that men can do.

00:17:25.190 --> 00:17:28.740
Remember Ginger Rogers did
everything that Fred Astaire did.

00:17:28.740 --> 00:17:30.580
She just did it backwards in high heels.

00:17:30.580 --> 00:17:31.870
Women have to be twice as good

00:17:31.870 --> 00:17:33.180
to be considered half as good.

00:17:33.180 --> 00:17:34.700
And that's just it.

00:17:34.700 --> 00:17:36.870
But (claps hands) here's
what I say to them (chuckles)

00:17:36.870 --> 00:17:39.840
is that that's a fact.

00:17:39.840 --> 00:17:44.370
But don't highlight the fact
that you think you are a victim

00:17:44.370 --> 00:17:48.190
because people do not
want to elect a victim.

00:17:48.190 --> 00:17:50.410
They want to elect a warrior.

00:17:50.410 --> 00:17:53.520
And the only way we are
gonna eliminate those biases

00:17:53.520 --> 00:17:57.220
is to get warriors in
office, at the table,

00:17:57.220 --> 00:17:59.760
in those positions so that those biases

00:17:59.760 --> 00:18:01.210
go away over time.

00:18:01.210 --> 00:18:02.810
We're not gonna fix it in one election.

00:18:02.810 --> 00:18:04.740
These women will have that bias.

00:18:04.740 --> 00:18:07.450
But they cannot succumb to it.

00:18:07.450 --> 00:18:10.890
- I think that the thing that
hasn't and will not change

00:18:10.890 --> 00:18:14.370
is the need to go, to cover
what is gonna get clicks

00:18:14.370 --> 00:18:15.733
and is gonna get readers.

00:18:16.707 --> 00:18:18.180
- So true.
- And that is a constant.

00:18:18.180 --> 00:18:20.570
At the same time, I think
that there's greater awareness

00:18:20.570 --> 00:18:22.740
of the potential for
differential treatment

00:18:22.740 --> 00:18:25.890
than perhaps there was a few years back.

00:18:25.890 --> 00:18:28.700
And frankly, I think in
terms of the research,

00:18:28.700 --> 00:18:30.050
it's really difficult to study

00:18:30.050 --> 00:18:33.520
just because a lot of it's
so nuanced and subtle.

00:18:33.520 --> 00:18:36.210
If you're trying to
create a measure of bias,

00:18:36.210 --> 00:18:37.530
it's difficult

00:18:37.530 --> 00:18:40.230
because a lot of it's hard to track.

00:18:40.230 --> 00:18:43.970
And comparing Hillary Clinton
and Donald Trump in 2016,

00:18:43.970 --> 00:18:46.780
okay it's difficult to
attribute anything that happened

00:18:46.780 --> 00:18:49.720
to gender bias because
look, they're two people.

00:18:49.720 --> 00:18:51.233
They're really unusual.

00:18:52.961 --> 00:18:54.510
When people said her voice is shrill,

00:18:54.510 --> 00:18:56.350
okay that's probably a gender thing.

00:18:56.350 --> 00:18:59.898
But it's a difficult thing to study.

00:18:59.898 --> 00:19:02.340
It's the sort of thing where
there are studies suggesting

00:19:02.340 --> 00:19:04.370
there's no bias in the volume of coverage

00:19:04.370 --> 00:19:05.579
and the content of coverage

00:19:05.579 --> 00:19:08.590
if you look at men and women
congressional candidates.

00:19:08.590 --> 00:19:09.590
At the same time you think,

00:19:09.590 --> 00:19:12.430
uh maybe we're just not
measuring this right.

00:19:12.430 --> 00:19:13.263
- And you know what?

00:19:13.263 --> 00:19:16.270
There's the great, the democratization

00:19:16.270 --> 00:19:18.170
of political discourse through Twitter

00:19:18.170 --> 00:19:22.870
allows for entities to
be checked by the masses.

00:19:22.870 --> 00:19:25.460
And there's so many young
people who are on there,

00:19:25.460 --> 00:19:28.070
whose antennae are up and
are listening for this

00:19:28.070 --> 00:19:31.040
and are checking the media all the time.

00:19:31.040 --> 00:19:32.110
And I just have to say one thing

00:19:32.110 --> 00:19:33.380
about this shrill voice thing

00:19:33.380 --> 00:19:35.133
'cause you'll hear this again.

00:19:35.133 --> 00:19:37.150
You even hear strains of it right now

00:19:37.150 --> 00:19:38.480
in talking about Elizabeth Warren

00:19:38.480 --> 00:19:40.250
when she went to Iowa et cetera.

00:19:40.250 --> 00:19:42.810
This is the hardest
thing for women in office

00:19:42.810 --> 00:19:45.210
because (deepens voice) we
don't have these deep voices.

00:19:45.210 --> 00:19:48.730
And so our natural voice
is going to be higher.

00:19:48.730 --> 00:19:52.960
And if you are making a forceful point,

00:19:52.960 --> 00:19:54.630
the speech coaches will train

00:19:54.630 --> 00:19:57.830
all of these women
candidates to try to lower

00:19:57.830 --> 00:19:59.890
your voice rather than allow it

00:19:59.890 --> 00:20:01.250
to get up to a higher register

00:20:01.250 --> 00:20:04.890
because people are just not there yet.

00:20:04.890 --> 00:20:08.316
- I would be in big trouble
(laughs) with the direction.

00:20:08.316 --> 00:20:09.658
- (with deep voice) You would have to.

00:20:09.658 --> 00:20:10.657
We all would.

00:20:10.657 --> 00:20:14.380
I mean I certainly had to
check myself a lot on that.

00:20:14.380 --> 00:20:17.330
- One thing that's really
interesting to me is that

00:20:17.330 --> 00:20:21.840
we have some new members of the U.S. House

00:20:21.840 --> 00:20:25.580
who are, particularly younger
women who have been elected,

00:20:25.580 --> 00:20:28.110
like Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez,

00:20:28.110 --> 00:20:29.979
who seem to be throwing
some of those rules--

00:20:29.979 --> 00:20:31.590
- Love it.
- out the door

00:20:31.590 --> 00:20:34.008
and saying, "I'm going
to be my authentic self,

00:20:34.008 --> 00:20:36.630
"and if you don't it, so be it."

00:20:36.630 --> 00:20:40.017
But people on the left
at least seem to like it.

00:20:40.017 --> 00:20:42.620
So is there some sort of intersection

00:20:42.620 --> 00:20:45.720
between age and gender
that is playing out here?

00:20:45.720 --> 00:20:46.553
It seems like it.

00:20:46.553 --> 00:20:47.780
- I think there totally is.

00:20:47.780 --> 00:20:50.590
And I love these younger
women who are saying

00:20:50.590 --> 00:20:55.590
basically screw you (chuckles)
to the political pundits

00:20:57.930 --> 00:20:59.640
and all of the folks who have

00:20:59.640 --> 00:21:01.770
historically brought women along.

00:21:01.770 --> 00:21:05.870
And I think those who are in
the job of training women,

00:21:05.870 --> 00:21:08.660
like the Emerges and the Emily's
List, they're understanding

00:21:08.660 --> 00:21:11.000
that people are craving that authenticity.

00:21:11.000 --> 00:21:15.140
That doesn't mean that you
can throw everything out

00:21:15.140 --> 00:21:17.100
'cause there's certain sort of bounds

00:21:17.100 --> 00:21:18.400
that you've got to operate in.

00:21:18.400 --> 00:21:22.870
But I love the fact that
A.O.C. as she's called

00:21:22.870 --> 00:21:26.830
uses social media in a savvier way

00:21:26.830 --> 00:21:29.950
than almost anybody
out there in responding

00:21:29.950 --> 00:21:31.640
and is fearless about it.

00:21:31.640 --> 00:21:34.293
So that fearlessness I think
is a really important thing

00:21:34.293 --> 00:21:36.150
that Millennials have given as a gift

00:21:36.150 --> 00:21:38.140
to the political universe.

00:21:38.140 --> 00:21:41.760
- So 2018 has been labeled
by political pundits

00:21:41.760 --> 00:21:43.400
as the year of the woman.

00:21:43.400 --> 00:21:45.020
And of course, it's not the first time

00:21:45.020 --> 00:21:47.500
that this label has been put on a year.

00:21:47.500 --> 00:21:50.860
1992 was the last time that
this label was applied.

00:21:50.860 --> 00:21:53.700
And that was following
the Anita Hill hearings

00:21:53.700 --> 00:21:56.720
and a handful of senators getting elected

00:21:56.720 --> 00:21:58.840
in the wake of those hearings.

00:21:58.840 --> 00:22:01.710
What are some of the
parallels that you see

00:22:01.710 --> 00:22:04.510
between the early '90s and now,

00:22:04.510 --> 00:22:07.130
and how do you think things have evolved

00:22:07.130 --> 00:22:09.190
if at all, between then and now?

00:22:09.190 --> 00:22:10.023
Let's start with Sarah.

00:22:10.023 --> 00:22:13.630
- Sure well I mean there
are the obvious parallels,

00:22:13.630 --> 00:22:18.040
a Supreme Court nominee
accused of sexual harassment,

00:22:18.040 --> 00:22:21.863
sexual assault and the backlash to that.

00:22:22.962 --> 00:22:27.962
At the same time, in '92
there was also of retirements,

00:22:28.780 --> 00:22:31.870
congressional retirements, and
so this desire for outsiders.

00:22:31.870 --> 00:22:33.760
And frankly, 'cause women are a minority,

00:22:33.760 --> 00:22:36.140
they are viewed as outsiders.
- I totally agree.

00:22:36.140 --> 00:22:37.890
- I think that that was part of it.

00:22:39.340 --> 00:22:41.700
Things that are different though.

00:22:41.700 --> 00:22:44.280
Well first of all, you ended up in '92

00:22:44.280 --> 00:22:47.400
with a Democratic president
and a Democratic congress.

00:22:47.400 --> 00:22:48.960
And that's definitely
not where we are now.

00:22:48.960 --> 00:22:52.620
And polarization is sort of
the elephant in the room.

00:22:52.620 --> 00:22:56.350
The divide between the political parties

00:22:56.350 --> 00:22:59.310
is just nowhere near what it was in '92.

00:22:59.310 --> 00:23:00.820
And I think that that has a major impact.

00:23:00.820 --> 00:23:04.940
And also, Donald Trump is a phenomenon

00:23:04.940 --> 00:23:07.990
that has no parallel in 1992.

00:23:07.990 --> 00:23:10.810
I mean we're just in a
completely different world

00:23:10.810 --> 00:23:12.160
with our current president.

00:23:13.290 --> 00:23:16.380
Yeah so the real question is,

00:23:16.380 --> 00:23:18.700
can we expect this
enthusiasm and this surge

00:23:18.700 --> 00:23:23.200
in female candidacies to continue?

00:23:23.200 --> 00:23:24.993
And after '92, we did not.

00:23:26.132 --> 00:23:28.120
It wasn't a blip because

00:23:28.120 --> 00:23:29.840
there was a steady increase over time

00:23:29.840 --> 00:23:32.430
in the share of women running and elected.

00:23:32.430 --> 00:23:36.740
And one nice difference
between today and '92 is that

00:23:36.740 --> 00:23:38.500
I think it's seen as more legitimate

00:23:38.500 --> 00:23:39.490
for women to hold office.

00:23:39.490 --> 00:23:41.330
There are just a lot more women

00:23:41.330 --> 00:23:43.130
who are getting elected and running.

00:23:44.330 --> 00:23:47.320
But it remains to be
seen what's gonna happen.

00:23:47.320 --> 00:23:51.770
Is the 2018 surge going to
continue into 2020, 2022?

00:23:51.770 --> 00:23:52.603
I don't know.

00:23:52.603 --> 00:23:53.640
It's too soon to tell.

00:23:53.640 --> 00:23:54.900
I don't know.

00:23:54.900 --> 00:23:55.733
You seem to think that--
- Yeah I mean

00:23:55.733 --> 00:23:56.566
I think about it.

00:23:56.566 --> 00:23:59.190
So in 1992, I think there were five women

00:23:59.190 --> 00:24:00.050
who were elected in the Senate.

00:24:00.050 --> 00:24:01.800
And that was the year of the woman,

00:24:01.800 --> 00:24:04.440
five out of 100, woo-hoo.

00:24:04.440 --> 00:24:09.080
And then, I think 20 years later in 2012,

00:24:09.080 --> 00:24:11.880
there were 20 women elected in the Senate.

00:24:11.880 --> 00:24:13.950
And that was seen as a huge breakthrough.

00:24:13.950 --> 00:24:18.250
And so here we are in
2019, and we have 25 women.

00:24:18.250 --> 00:24:20.870
And we're still not at 50.

00:24:20.870 --> 00:24:23.440
So we've still got a long way to go.

00:24:23.440 --> 00:24:26.990
I think this year of the
woman thing, (clicks tongue)

00:24:26.990 --> 00:24:29.370
I think the difference really right now

00:24:29.370 --> 00:24:34.370
is this notion of young
women who do not feel bound

00:24:34.940 --> 00:24:39.940
by previous mores in terms of
how you operate politically.

00:24:40.730 --> 00:24:43.870
I think that the young,
these Millennial women

00:24:43.870 --> 00:24:47.397
and younger, the Gen Zs, I think.

00:24:47.397 --> 00:24:49.890
They're called the Mil-Zs, the combination

00:24:49.890 --> 00:24:52.150
of Millennial and Gen Z.

00:24:52.150 --> 00:24:55.130
They are not havin' any of it.

00:24:55.130 --> 00:24:56.410
They're not goin' back.

00:24:56.410 --> 00:24:58.040
They are not havin' any of that.

00:24:58.040 --> 00:25:02.080
So this push to authenticity
and to allowing people,

00:25:02.080 --> 00:25:05.780
I think a lot of reality
TV has opened up the door

00:25:05.780 --> 00:25:08.725
of allowing people just to be who they are

00:25:08.725 --> 00:25:12.670
and to capitalize on struggles.

00:25:12.670 --> 00:25:15.727
So there's a lot of women who were firsts,

00:25:15.727 --> 00:25:20.310
who were elected as first
Muslim American woman,

00:25:20.310 --> 00:25:22.540
first Native American women.

00:25:22.540 --> 00:25:25.210
And they were unabashed about sharing

00:25:25.210 --> 00:25:28.020
the challenges that happened
while and how they over,

00:25:28.020 --> 00:25:29.450
I mean the story about overcoming

00:25:29.450 --> 00:25:31.260
is the most important piece of that,

00:25:31.260 --> 00:25:33.483
and how they championed
so that people see,

00:25:34.520 --> 00:25:37.670
if you overcame that, I can
overcome my struggles too.

00:25:37.670 --> 00:25:40.080
And being open and free to share,

00:25:40.080 --> 00:25:42.240
I think that is a huge difference

00:25:42.240 --> 00:25:45.420
and that women are by nature,

00:25:45.420 --> 00:25:49.570
not by nature, by circumstance outsiders.

00:25:49.570 --> 00:25:50.890
I think that point about
them being outsiders

00:25:50.890 --> 00:25:52.680
is absolutely fundamental.

00:25:52.680 --> 00:25:54.020
Why not try something else

00:25:54.020 --> 00:25:55.340
'cause what we've got ain't workin'?

00:25:55.340 --> 00:25:59.060
- Right and I think also
just the success of women

00:25:59.060 --> 00:26:01.350
this particular midterm.

00:26:01.350 --> 00:26:03.610
You have now a bunch of role models,

00:26:03.610 --> 00:26:06.040
a bunch of people that
other women can look to

00:26:06.040 --> 00:26:08.787
and say, "Oh maybe I could do that."

00:26:10.250 --> 00:26:11.870
I think it does have the potential

00:26:11.870 --> 00:26:13.030
to have a longer term impact

00:26:13.030 --> 00:26:14.647
on the political ambition
gap between men and women.

00:26:14.647 --> 00:26:16.640
- I totally agree, totally agree.

00:26:16.640 --> 00:26:20.470
- So do you expect to see
the same number of women

00:26:20.470 --> 00:26:22.480
running for office--
- More.

00:26:22.480 --> 00:26:23.350
- More women.
- More.

00:26:23.350 --> 00:26:26.600
- And the same or more
voter turnout among women?

00:26:26.600 --> 00:26:27.979
- Yeah I totally think,

00:26:27.979 --> 00:26:32.500
again partly propelled by
opposition to the President.

00:26:32.500 --> 00:26:35.770
But I do think that you are
gonna see a woman on the ticket.

00:26:35.770 --> 00:26:37.070
I firmly believe it.

00:26:37.070 --> 00:26:39.640
I don't know if she'll be
in number one or number two,

00:26:39.640 --> 00:26:40.860
president or vice-president.

00:26:40.860 --> 00:26:42.890
But I think we will have
a woman on the ticket.

00:26:42.890 --> 00:26:44.523
And that's gonna be exciting.

00:26:45.368 --> 00:26:47.860
And I think you're gonna see more women

00:26:47.860 --> 00:26:49.070
who are running for president,

00:26:49.070 --> 00:26:52.830
who are legitimate serious contenders.

00:26:52.830 --> 00:26:56.580
And that kind of brawling
is really healthy

00:26:56.580 --> 00:26:58.130
from a democracy point of view.

00:26:59.110 --> 00:27:00.573
- Sarah any predictions?

00:27:01.610 --> 00:27:04.930
- I would love to be shown information

00:27:04.930 --> 00:27:05.880
that would lead me to be optimistic.

00:27:05.880 --> 00:27:07.123
I want to be.
(laughs)

00:27:07.123 --> 00:27:09.442
I wanna be encouraged.

00:27:09.442 --> 00:27:11.023
And I just look at the.

00:27:12.960 --> 00:27:14.940
We don't know what will happen in 2020

00:27:14.940 --> 00:27:17.710
and how long President
Trump will be around

00:27:17.710 --> 00:27:19.140
to be this motivating force

00:27:19.140 --> 00:27:22.040
and how permanent the impacts
are in the Republican party.

00:27:23.500 --> 00:27:25.810
If not Donald Trump,
there could be another

00:27:25.810 --> 00:27:26.933
Trump-like figure.

00:27:28.404 --> 00:27:31.110
People are energized to participate

00:27:31.110 --> 00:27:32.700
when their enemies are in office.

00:27:32.700 --> 00:27:34.410
So when--
- Totally true.

00:27:34.410 --> 00:27:38.850
- For better or worse, anger
is a very strong motivator.

00:27:38.850 --> 00:27:42.800
So the question is, will that persist,

00:27:42.800 --> 00:27:45.176
that motivation to--
- In 2020?

00:27:45.176 --> 00:27:46.970
- In 2020 and beyond.
- Don't you think it will?

00:27:46.970 --> 00:27:48.170
- Yes absolutely.
- Okay so--

00:27:48.170 --> 00:27:49.690
- I'm just saying going forward--

00:27:49.690 --> 00:27:51.810
- Beyond.
- Beyond yeah.

00:27:51.810 --> 00:27:55.540
So the question being,
will we see the enthusiasm

00:27:55.540 --> 00:27:57.640
and turnout dip at some
point in the future?

00:27:57.640 --> 00:27:59.980
Is this a lasting change?
- Not in 2020.

00:27:59.980 --> 00:28:01.560
But who knows into the future?

00:28:01.560 --> 00:28:02.560
- One thing that was interesting

00:28:02.560 --> 00:28:05.550
that I believe you
mentioned, Governor Granholm,

00:28:05.550 --> 00:28:09.226
was the suite of resistance organizations

00:28:09.226 --> 00:28:11.210
that have sprung up after 2016.

00:28:11.210 --> 00:28:14.320
And I think of the four
or five that you listed,

00:28:14.320 --> 00:28:17.480
all of them have a least
a female co-founder

00:28:17.480 --> 00:28:18.800
- Totally--
- or are being led

00:28:18.800 --> 00:28:20.300
100 percent by women.

00:28:20.300 --> 00:28:23.360
So it seems like that could play a role

00:28:23.360 --> 00:28:27.060
in maintaining enthusiasm and
turnout in the years ahead,

00:28:27.060 --> 00:28:29.810
a new ecosystem of
grassroots organizations

00:28:29.810 --> 00:28:31.413
championed by women.
- Yes.

00:28:32.270 --> 00:28:33.103
- Can you speak to that?

00:28:33.103 --> 00:28:35.090
- No no I think you put your finger on it.

00:28:35.090 --> 00:28:37.883
I think women, not just in front of,

00:28:38.860 --> 00:28:40.820
not just raising their
hand to say, "I'm running,"

00:28:40.820 --> 00:28:41.667
but raising their hand to say,

00:28:41.667 --> 00:28:44.267
"I am going to create an
ecosystem that ensures

00:28:44.267 --> 00:28:47.420
"greater representation for
women across the board."

00:28:47.420 --> 00:28:49.943
And so many of these, it's great.

00:28:50.870 --> 00:28:52.590
They do have co-founders, many of them.

00:28:52.590 --> 00:28:53.920
Some of them are just two women

00:28:53.920 --> 00:28:55.527
who founded it and said, (claps hands)

00:28:55.527 --> 00:28:56.610
"Enough is enough."

00:28:56.610 --> 00:28:57.970
But the bottom line is,

00:28:57.970 --> 00:29:02.150
the fact that women are
at the ground level,

00:29:02.150 --> 00:29:06.010
building organization, building capacity,

00:29:06.010 --> 00:29:07.680
in addition to running for office

00:29:07.680 --> 00:29:09.150
and in addition to voting,

00:29:09.150 --> 00:29:12.950
those three pieces of democracy are now,

00:29:12.950 --> 00:29:15.560
you're seeing much greater representation.

00:29:15.560 --> 00:29:17.760
And I think that will
bear fruit in the future.

00:29:17.760 --> 00:29:20.110
- I think we should wrap it
up on that optimistic note.

00:29:20.110 --> 00:29:21.288
Thank you so much speaking with us.

00:29:21.288 --> 00:29:22.700
- You bet.
- Thank you.

00:29:22.700 --> 00:29:26.403
- Thank you both.
(upbeat band music)
