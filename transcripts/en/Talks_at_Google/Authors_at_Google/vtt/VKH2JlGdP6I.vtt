00:00:03.220 --> 00:00:07.460
&gt;&gt;Female Announcer: Joining us all the way
from Santa Cruz to talk about his latest book.

00:00:07.460 --> 00:00:12.770
Uh, his book is called "The Misleading Mind:
How We Create Our Own Problems and How Buddhist

00:00:12.770 --> 00:00:18.070
Psychology Can Help Us Solve Them" So Karuna's
going to talk a little about this today. And

00:00:18.070 --> 00:00:23.820
a little bit of background before he gets
started. So Karuna, uh, spent twelve years

00:00:23.820 --> 00:00:29.730
working with Tibetan refugees in Nepal and
studying the Buddhist masters in person live.

00:00:29.730 --> 00:00:35.730
Ah, his Karuna Group Practice supplies the
Buddhist psychology to people and organizations.

00:00:35.730 --> 00:00:41.520
Karuna's also a senior trainer for the Potential
Project. This is a corporate based mindfulness

00:00:41.520 --> 00:00:48.020
training. And you can read more about it at
www.potentialproject.com. And essentially

00:00:48.020 --> 00:00:55.040
what we're covering today is to talk about
the process for working with rather than against

00:00:55.040 --> 00:01:00.640
depression, anxiety or compulsions by recognizing
habitual ways that our minds often can mislead

00:01:00.640 --> 00:01:06.790
us. So very excited to have Karuna here today
and again, thanks for coming. Please welcome

00:01:06.790 --> 00:01:12.440
Karuna. And I'll hand over mic.
&gt;&gt;Karuna: Thank you.

00:01:12.440 --> 00:01:18.740
[Applause]
&gt;&gt;Karuna: Is this on? Hope I don't trip on

00:01:18.740 --> 00:01:24.940
the wires. Well first I'm very honored to
be here. They told me I have to stand close

00:01:24.940 --> 00:01:31.010
to this podium, but I'm going to try and creep
around a bit as time goes on. I'm very honored

00:01:31.010 --> 00:01:35.540
to be here. Thank you for coming. And, you
know, I don't know if anyone's, has anyone

00:01:35.540 --> 00:01:43.950
else written a book before? No, yeah? Did
you think someone would read it? Yeah. I mean

00:01:43.950 --> 00:01:48.640
while writing the book I thought I'll write
this book and it's quite a labor of love.

00:01:48.640 --> 00:01:52.610
I never thought that actually anyone would,
the reading part, the audience part never

00:01:52.610 --> 00:01:56.530
came alive until I was finished and then I
realized I had to do a lot more work around

00:01:56.530 --> 00:02:01.890
it. But I'm very, uh very, very happy to have
written this book and very happy that people

00:02:01.890 --> 00:02:08.780
are reading it and it seems to be of some
use to them. Um, usually when I give these

00:02:08.780 --> 00:02:14.890
kind of talks I think it's really important
to set up the context, right, because the

00:02:14.890 --> 00:02:20.110
words in the book come from somewhere, right,
it's all interdependent on what where I came

00:02:20.110 --> 00:02:25.610
from and. I think that's important to share
that. Usually start my history around the

00:02:25.610 --> 00:02:33.280
time um, I finished High School. Uh, I didn't,
I wasn't much of a student. Didn't like school

00:02:33.280 --> 00:02:37.240
that much. And so I took a year off and my
mother said 'if you're going to take the year

00:02:37.240 --> 00:02:40.950
off' after I graduated from high school she
said "You have to promise me you'll go to

00:02:40.950 --> 00:02:45.230
college in a year." And so I promised her,
and of course the year ended and I said I

00:02:45.230 --> 00:02:50.520
think I'm going to take another year. And
uh, she was quite firm and said 'you know

00:02:50.520 --> 00:02:54.800
you made your promise'. So she was very kind
in that she found a school up in the Lincoln

00:02:54.800 --> 00:03:00.410
Washington that people won't know about now,
but it, back this is the ear- late, early

00:03:00.410 --> 00:03:05.349
seventies, where there weren't a lot of alternative
options for schools, colleges. But there was

00:03:05.349 --> 00:03:09.760
one in Santa Cruz, UC Santa Cruz was just
beginning I think. So I went to Evergreen

00:03:09.760 --> 00:03:15.940
State College, which allowed you to study
and graduate without actually having to take

00:03:15.940 --> 00:03:22.060
grades. So you had evaluations, it was perfect
for me. But the reason I tell you this is,

00:03:22.060 --> 00:03:27.100
um, I had begun to get interested in, I grew
up outside Los Angeles, part of the whole

00:03:27.100 --> 00:03:36.340
end of the middle of the hippie thing. And,
um, I was somehow got interested in yoga,

00:03:36.340 --> 00:03:42.770
as a high school student and I went to a yoga
retreat. And, uh, prior to that I was, of

00:03:42.770 --> 00:03:47.690
course, doing all the things that we did then,
you know, doing lots of partying, drugs, the

00:03:47.690 --> 00:03:54.090
whole thing and went to this, uh, yoga retreat.
And I came back and I gave up eating meat,

00:03:54.090 --> 00:03:59.069
smoking cigarettes and getting high all that.
So I lost all my friends. No one came around

00:03:59.069 --> 00:04:03.140
anymore. I thought my friends were my friends,
but I guess they were, you know, but they

00:04:03.140 --> 00:04:06.250
weren't. Except for one guy Dave, and Dave
is featured in the book, in the early part

00:04:06.250 --> 00:04:11.659
of the book. So, that was quite a wakeup call
and there wasn't much, it was really hard

00:04:11.659 --> 00:04:15.220
to find something. I was really interested
in meditation, what is meditation? And it

00:04:15.220 --> 00:04:21.620
wasn't easy to find much explained in those,
then. Um, so I ended up at Evergreen State

00:04:21.620 --> 00:04:25.690
College I was still involved in yoga. And
then uh a program came along called the Year

00:04:25.690 --> 00:04:32.169
In Nepal. And I don't know if you know, if
you read, you know thing the interesting thing

00:04:32.169 --> 00:04:36.870
in those days was, you know, find your guru.
People were going to India and finding a guru

00:04:36.870 --> 00:04:40.880
and I had a little bit of that sort of resonating
with, well not a little and really resonated

00:04:40.880 --> 00:04:44.770
with me. But here I was stuck in this college
and I thought "A year in Nepal. Where's that

00:04:44.770 --> 00:04:49.360
at?" I didn't know where Nepal was. Looked
on the map and of course, as you know, I'm

00:04:49.360 --> 00:04:52.420
sure everyone knows it's right next to India.
So I thought, well that's easy, I'll sneak

00:04:52.420 --> 00:04:57.330
into India find some guru, I'll do, you know,
get this degree and everything will be cool.

00:04:57.330 --> 00:05:03.940
Well I loved Nepal and has anyone here been
in Nepal? No? Well it's changed a lot but

00:05:03.940 --> 00:05:08.970
it's still a beautiful country, worthwhile
to go visit. And uh I was there, I went to

00:05:08.970 --> 00:05:15.060
Nepal in 1975. And instead of staying a year
I left in 1988. I did have one, a year and

00:05:15.060 --> 00:05:20.430
a half break in the early stages back here
where I had to come back and start a master's

00:05:20.430 --> 00:05:22.960
program. Because the only way you could stay
in Nepal then was either you had to be in

00:05:22.960 --> 00:05:26.780
development work or a student. So I knew I
had to do the student thing. So I went back

00:05:26.780 --> 00:05:31.711
and I did the longest master's degree of anyone
ever. It was like ten years, so I could keep

00:05:31.711 --> 00:05:41.800
my visa. Thanks. So that's the really core
part of this book is that the foundation of

00:05:41.800 --> 00:05:50.020
it of course, was the ten twelve years I spent
in Nepal and I found myself, uh, really, originally

00:05:50.020 --> 00:05:56.370
I went there to study the difference between
Hinduism that was arriving in America comparing

00:05:56.370 --> 00:06:03.150
to what really exists in a Hindu country.
And Nepal is sort of Hindu and Buddhist. But

00:06:03.150 --> 00:06:08.460
that's a little bit like someone going to
Silicon Valley to study technology, you know.

00:06:08.460 --> 00:06:14.090
It's like it's just imbued here, right. It's
it's, how do you extract it out? So I became

00:06:14.090 --> 00:06:18.229
pretty bored and disillusioned, but there
was a monastery nearby of the village I was

00:06:18.229 --> 00:06:23.750
living. I was immersed in Nepalese culture,
Nepalese language. There was a monastery teaching,

00:06:23.750 --> 00:06:30.910
uh, meditation course for westerns. For foreigners.
And it, again this is 1975, it was very tough

00:06:30.910 --> 00:06:36.449
if you were interested in, you'd see Tibetan
Buddhists walking around and you really wonder

00:06:36.449 --> 00:06:40.979
what were they about and you could. But to
study it, it almost, it was very tough, but

00:06:40.979 --> 00:06:45.419
there was this monastery there that taught
these one month cour- intensive courses in

00:06:45.419 --> 00:06:52.690
English, Kopan monastery. That's where I ended
up. I didn't want to go there because I was,

00:06:52.690 --> 00:06:58.040
it wasn't cool enough for me. Because I was
like Nepalese guy. And I didn't want to go

00:06:58.040 --> 00:07:03.039
up there with a bunch of foreigners and tourists.
So I did swallow my pride, fortunately, went

00:07:03.039 --> 00:07:07.669
up there. And it was at this one month course
and then that's where I stayed for the next

00:07:07.669 --> 00:07:14.800
twelve years or so. Very unique place. What
was unique about it, it featured, was unique

00:07:14.800 --> 00:07:21.580
about it- one of their Lama named Lama Thubten
Yeshe who passed away in 1984. And uh, you

00:07:21.580 --> 00:07:25.550
know, again, I had the great fortune of working
closely with him. He was, what I would call

00:07:25.550 --> 00:07:39.560
a renaissance lama. Gotta get away from that.
Um, what I mean by that is that he, um, I

00:07:39.560 --> 00:07:46.260
don't know he had this wisdom and understanding
that things were changing really fast. That

00:07:46.260 --> 00:07:52.240
Tibetans had been of course, expelled from
Tibet, many of them, hundred thousand of them

00:07:52.240 --> 00:07:56.582
or so. And he had seen the writing on the
wall. We were the first monastery to start

00:07:56.582 --> 00:08:02.510
an English program, a western studies, a modern
studies program, which I was responsible for,

00:08:02.510 --> 00:08:07.759
which was kind of ironic, 'cause I hated school.
So here I was starting something for them,

00:08:07.759 --> 00:08:13.300
the young monks. There were about 85 monks
in those days. And so, uh, but he said to

00:08:13.300 --> 00:08:18.410
me, you know, and he said, he had a program,
he had a way of thinking, where he said, and

00:08:18.410 --> 00:08:22.669
this really the mission of this book. If I
get anything across today, here's what I want

00:08:22.669 --> 00:08:29.100
to get across. The ideas that we're talking
about in Buddhist thought are universal. You

00:08:29.100 --> 00:08:36.099
do not have to be Buddhist. You can be Christian,
you can be Jewish, you can be American, or

00:08:36.099 --> 00:08:40.629
you can be Russian, you can be, it doesn't
matter. Now there is a, there is a challenge

00:08:40.629 --> 00:08:46.100
in the translation, right? Because these ideas
are still new in modern language, in modern

00:08:46.100 --> 00:08:50.900
cultures. So the really the mission of this
book, was really lama Yeshe's mission. So

00:08:50.900 --> 00:08:56.079
I feel I was just carrying the mantel and
doing my little part for him. Uh, in that,

00:08:56.079 --> 00:08:59.319
I really really want to explain these things.
Now I had the great fortune of being there

00:08:59.319 --> 00:09:04.660
a long time studying, I still study, that
was 1975 till now. And I, it's just not possible

00:09:04.660 --> 00:09:09.360
for everyone to do that. So, I hope that,
uh, through this message of this book that

00:09:09.360 --> 00:09:15.910
you're able to sort of jump time and all that
effort, uh, to get to some of these ideas.

00:09:15.910 --> 00:09:21.279
Now the, Lama Yeshe's couple of things he
said, one of the things he said to me and

00:09:21.279 --> 00:09:28.649
to other students, he said "You know these
ideas are universal. You have to cut through

00:09:28.649 --> 00:09:33.110
them." I think once we, a group of us, uh,
asked the Dalai Lama did he think Tibetan

00:09:33.110 --> 00:09:41.600
Buddhism, um, uh, able to transfer into modern
culture, or into the West and those who said

00:09:41.600 --> 00:09:47.899
it then. And he said "Well, leave the Tibetan
with us and take the Buddhism." And I think

00:09:47.899 --> 00:09:54.110
that's, so it's tricky to find to extract
the culture from what is the actual principles.

00:09:54.110 --> 00:10:00.189
The principles for the most part in Buddhist
thought are psychological. You know, it of

00:10:00.189 --> 00:10:05.990
course, there is the philosophy. It's really
not, it's religious depending on the culture

00:10:05.990 --> 00:10:12.480
that it traveled to. So there was the historical
Buddha, Shakyamuni Buddha alive more than

00:10:12.480 --> 00:10:17.269
2500 years ago. Which is really fascinating,
a little village, some little area of India

00:10:17.269 --> 00:10:23.879
then. And it, you know it's really amazing
it spread from, uh, as far south as Sri Lanka

00:10:23.879 --> 00:10:33.779
as far north as southern Russia as far east
as, uh, Indonesia and Korea, Japan, north,

00:10:33.779 --> 00:10:39.299
I mean china, and south east Asia and as far
west as, I think as, well as far west we know

00:10:39.299 --> 00:10:46.189
for sure as Afghanistan. And where ever it
went it didn't ask the cultures to adapt to

00:10:46.189 --> 00:10:51.489
that system of thought, right? It said "What,
in our system, in this system of thought is

00:10:51.489 --> 00:10:56.910
applicable to your culture?" So think about
what's happening now today in our culture.

00:10:56.910 --> 00:11:00.540
And that's a hard word to say, our culture,
'cause if I just talk about America it's,

00:11:00.540 --> 00:11:06.170
uh, a multiple cultures, right? But if we
just generically, or generally, uh, what do

00:11:06.170 --> 00:11:13.869
you think is the system of the dominate system
of thought in this modern culture? Does anyone

00:11:13.869 --> 00:11:18.100
want to say?
&gt;&gt;Male #1: Our culture? Scientific [inaudible].

00:11:18.100 --> 00:11:23.540
&gt;&gt;Karuna: Yeah, thank you, exactly, right.
Now isn't it amazing, scientific, and materialism

00:11:23.540 --> 00:11:32.449
and it, and you know, see in Buddhist system
of thought there is a science that can morph

00:11:32.449 --> 00:11:37.509
and adapt in here into this culture. As the
[unintelligible] dalai lama for many years

00:11:37.509 --> 00:11:44.129
had a dialog with modern western day uh, modern
day scientists. So, that's the idea and I

00:11:44.129 --> 00:11:49.389
think that from my background, uh, when I
um, those years in Nepal what was I going

00:11:49.389 --> 00:11:55.199
to do when I came back to the States? You
know, how do you integrate that? I mean, how

00:11:55.199 --> 00:12:00.800
do you integrate that that richness of experience
and that's why I became a, um, psychotherapist.

00:12:00.800 --> 00:12:07.800
I got my master's in clinical psychology.
And it was tough, because, uh, I had already

00:12:07.800 --> 00:12:13.949
studied this complete system of thought. Very
complete 2500 years old, it had been debated,

00:12:13.949 --> 00:12:18.619
it had been, you know, uh, uh, discussed,
it been meditated upon, it's you know. All

00:12:18.619 --> 00:12:25.260
this so rich so deep, so thick. And then I
come back to California and I'm working with,

00:12:25.260 --> 00:12:32.109
you know, getting a master's degree psychology
which is a system of thought. It's really,

00:12:32.109 --> 00:12:40.709
really new. Isn't it? Think about it. It's,
it's, it's very new. And, um, so my job and

00:12:40.709 --> 00:12:45.660
it was difficult, my job still is. Is how
do we integrate these ideas? So then Lama

00:12:45.660 --> 00:12:50.740
Yeshe said, he said to me, he said "You know
you need to communicate these ideas so that

00:12:50.740 --> 00:13:00.149
your mother can understand them." Ok. So they're
not meant to be just for the scholar. And

00:13:00.149 --> 00:13:06.429
that's that's a pretty that's a big task because,
I don't know about your mother but, you know,

00:13:06.429 --> 00:13:10.720
it's not easy to do. So that's the idea, is
to communicate them so that anyone can understand

00:13:10.720 --> 00:13:13.499
them, because they are useful. Let's go to
another part of this.

00:13:13.499 --> 00:13:19.290
Uh why is this even interesting? Why even
get involved in this Buddhist psychology?

00:13:19.290 --> 00:13:25.929
Uh, there's only really one purpose and that
is that, uh, the we all are looking for the

00:13:25.929 --> 00:13:34.529
same thing. What we're looking for is, it's
pretty simple, is to be happy. And we could

00:13:34.529 --> 00:13:40.600
make an argument that everything we do is
for that purpose. And it becomes really fascinating,

00:13:40.600 --> 00:13:43.839
of course then we have to define what do you
mean by happiness? But, the other thing about

00:13:43.839 --> 00:13:49.769
Buddhist thought is that we define everything,
well, all important terms are defined. So

00:13:49.769 --> 00:13:59.109
that we have the same, uh, language, to have
a conversation with. You know, um, I'm just

00:13:59.109 --> 00:14:08.180
curious has anyone studied, you know, excuse
me, studied psychology in here? Did you, so

00:14:08.180 --> 00:14:11.649
psychology. Psych means what?
&gt;&gt;Female #1: Soul

00:14:11.649 --> 00:14:15.650
&gt;&gt;Karuna: Soul, what else? Soul, psyche
&gt;&gt;Male #2: Mind

00:14:15.650 --> 00:14:18.389
&gt;&gt;Karuna: Mind, And -ology?
&gt;&gt;Audience: Study of.

00:14:18.389 --> 00:14:26.220
&gt;&gt;Karuna: Study of! Study of the mind, right?
Did you ever study the mind, have a class

00:14:26.220 --> 00:14:34.171
on the definition, the nature of mind in your
study of psychology? No. Anybody else. In

00:14:34.171 --> 00:14:42.230
Russia did they? No. Anybody else? Is there
a third hand? I was thinking there was a third,

00:14:42.230 --> 00:14:49.759
but you chickened out. Um, isn't that amazing?
I mean think about that. Here we are trained

00:14:49.759 --> 00:14:56.609
to be psychologists, ok, psychotherapists,
therapists of the mind and we don't have a

00:14:56.609 --> 00:15:02.399
working accepted definition of the mind. I
don't think there's any other, I don't know

00:15:02.399 --> 00:15:13.399
if there's any other discipline that you would
have that same situation. If you were to travel

00:15:13.399 --> 00:15:20.720
throughout the Buddhist world I can't say
about, you know, the sort of, I mean, at least

00:15:20.720 --> 00:15:26.939
if you'd ask a scholar in, a Buddhist scholar
in Japan, a Buddhist scholar wherever, in

00:15:26.939 --> 00:15:34.220
Tibet. If you have a Buddhist scholar in Sri
Lanka, southeast Asia, generally speaking

00:15:34.220 --> 00:15:40.420
they will come up with the same definition
of the mind. It's debated in terms of what

00:15:40.420 --> 00:15:47.639
that means, but you have a working definition.
There's not an argument. I think that's fascinating.

00:15:47.639 --> 00:15:53.369
Here in the western world we don't have that.
I think that's interesting, I think that's

00:15:53.369 --> 00:15:59.210
kind of strange. Ok. So the purpose in Buddhist
psychology what is why is it psychology? Why

00:15:59.210 --> 00:16:06.049
even talk about it? I don't think there is
Islamic psychology, or Judaic, Christian psychology

00:16:06.049 --> 00:16:11.850
that I know. Why Buddhist psychology? Isn't
that kind of weird? The reason is simple.

00:16:11.850 --> 00:16:15.759
The reason is that this whole purpose of all
these systems of thought really is to be happy,

00:16:15.759 --> 00:16:20.139
right? To give you a system of thought to
kind of liberate yourself from difficulties

00:16:20.139 --> 00:16:26.309
from problems. So, the Buddhist approach,
what I think is very, very unique, is it's

00:16:26.309 --> 00:16:32.660
inner approach. That to, in fact the Tibetan
word for Buddhist is a word called nangpa

00:16:32.660 --> 00:16:39.839
and "nang" means inside or inner. And "pa"
is, uh, is a marker for a person or being.

00:16:39.839 --> 00:16:47.429
So it means "inner being." It's interesting.
An inner being is the definition of Buddhist.

00:16:47.429 --> 00:16:52.790
So you don't have to be, if anyone here who
thinks of themselves as the inner being you're

00:16:52.790 --> 00:16:56.809
Buddhist, so you don't have to worry about
changing religion. Ok? The thing is, and we

00:16:56.809 --> 00:17:02.029
don't want you to anyway. You're, um, the
the, so really I think again Buddhism is more

00:17:02.029 --> 00:17:07.910
of the [unintelligible] dalai calls it mind
science, why? Mind science is a synonym for

00:17:07.910 --> 00:17:17.350
psychology, isn't it? Close enough. Ok. So
again mind science. So I urge, uh, I you know

00:17:17.350 --> 00:17:21.659
the, within this book, my point is that I
think people can understand. I don't think

00:17:21.659 --> 00:17:28.360
I was too shallow or superficial in the book.
I really wanted to get you know, deeper into

00:17:28.360 --> 00:17:32.310
the concepts as best I could without losing
my audience. Because we're, you know, we can

00:17:32.310 --> 00:17:39.190
really lose it pretty easily. Um, so some
of the ideas here are that number one the

00:17:39.190 --> 00:17:44.100
only purpose of Buddhist psychology is to
be happy. And in the Buddhist psychology the

00:17:44.100 --> 00:17:49.419
idea is that happiness, ok you all know this,
but just to rephrase it, happiness doesn't

00:17:49.419 --> 00:17:55.121
come from outside. Ok, there's only two places,
there's the outside and the inside, there's

00:17:55.121 --> 00:18:01.279
subject, there's the object, right? And yet,
we spend all of our time, most of our time,

00:18:01.279 --> 00:18:06.680
maybe not consciously, maybe not you know
intentionally, but if we think about, you

00:18:06.680 --> 00:18:13.640
know, to be happy, we are generally speaking,
going to look for something to help us on

00:18:13.640 --> 00:18:20.200
the outside. Not always, but generally, that's
our sort of default mode. That's because that's

00:18:20.200 --> 00:18:24.790
the way we're trained. You know I think it'd
be good to start training you know, kids and

00:18:24.790 --> 00:18:29.549
people that know that there's options and
so in this context, happiness in the Buddhist

00:18:29.549 --> 00:18:39.820
context means a balanced mind. Ok. happiness
is an inside job. Ok, so uh, if happiness

00:18:39.820 --> 00:18:46.720
is an inside job then we need to understand
psychology. But we need to understand our

00:18:46.720 --> 00:18:49.960
psychology. The idea is not to necessarily
understand all these fabulous theories, which

00:18:49.960 --> 00:18:55.409
we have tons of. You know that in what the
Buddha taught himself, I was reading the other

00:18:55.409 --> 00:19:02.179
day, back 2500, 2600 years ago, sometimes
the monks in the monasteries recite the, what

00:19:02.179 --> 00:19:06.780
we call the sutras, which are just the words
and not the commentaries, just the words that

00:19:06.780 --> 00:19:10.370
Buddha spoke. And someone was saying I read
something the other day it would take a monk

00:19:10.370 --> 00:19:16.850
of course depends how fast he reads, right?
Take him forty days to recite the entire sutras,

00:19:16.850 --> 00:19:23.630
that Buddha spoke. That's a lot of words.
Buddha taught for forty years, unfortunately

00:19:23.630 --> 00:19:27.961
you know and with our other great teachers,
they maybe didn't teach as long, right? In

00:19:27.961 --> 00:19:32.860
forty years he didn't teach different things
every teaching, he kept repeating what he

00:19:32.860 --> 00:19:42.150
was teaching. Whatever. So I have a question,
so can someone, um, just look at your hand

00:19:42.150 --> 00:19:47.759
for a second, everybody has to do this, right?
People eating don't have to do this. Ok can

00:19:47.759 --> 00:19:52.480
someone tell me what color it is? What color
is your hand?

00:19:52.480 --> 00:19:57.259
[chatter]
&gt;&gt;Male #2: I would say it's a mixture of colors.

00:19:57.259 --> 00:19:59.730
&gt;&gt;Karuna: Mixture of colors, generally what
would you say?

00:19:59.730 --> 00:20:06.539
&gt;&gt;Male #2: Mine's pink.
&gt;&gt;Karuna: Pink. Tan. Tan. No one's white,

00:20:06.539 --> 00:20:10.820
but that's interesting. Ok someone tell me
what's the texture of your hand? Huh?

00:20:10.820 --> 00:20:20.720
&gt;&gt;Female #2: Soft?
&gt;&gt;Karuna: Soft, ok, what else? What's it's

00:20:20.720 --> 00:20:22.799
shape? This is not hard, is it?
[chuckle]

00:20:22.799 --> 00:20:26.850
&gt;&gt;Karuna: You got shape, shape is I don't
know how you describe the shape but you've

00:20:26.850 --> 00:20:34.870
got five digits, finger things. Ok, what's
it composed of? Skin. What else?

00:20:34.870 --> 00:20:38.659
[chatter]
&gt;&gt;Karuna: Right, right, ok so, we've had,

00:20:38.659 --> 00:20:42.500
there's more we could talk about the hand
right? There's more uh, to talk about the

00:20:42.500 --> 00:20:47.230
hand, but enough. Isn't it interesting we
are pretty, we're pretty good. Now we've had

00:20:47.230 --> 00:20:52.820
this hand since the moment we're born, at
least, I mean it formed in the womb as well.

00:20:52.820 --> 00:20:58.960
Now can someone tell me what is the color
of your mind?

00:20:58.960 --> 00:21:07.872
&gt;&gt;Female #3: Rainbow.
&gt;&gt;Karuna: Grey [chuckle] I'll go with that,

00:21:07.872 --> 00:21:17.770
I'm not sure what else. What is the shape
of your mind?

00:21:17.770 --> 00:21:28.370
Ok, what's it composed of? Or constructed
of? Ok, so we've had the mind since the day

00:21:28.370 --> 00:21:35.940
we were born also, maybe before. We don't
know the mind. We know our hand. You know

00:21:35.940 --> 00:21:40.000
if I asked you to describe your car, you'd
probably do as good a job as with your hand.

00:21:40.000 --> 00:21:45.240
If I asked you to desc- whatever. Everyone
knows how their face looks, we look at it

00:21:45.240 --> 00:21:51.299
every morning in the mirror or whatever. But
isn't it weird that at least half of our being,

00:21:51.299 --> 00:21:57.200
maybe more, but at least half of it is a mind,
right? You got mind and body. That's kind

00:21:57.200 --> 00:22:02.559
of strange. Don't you think it's strange?
Who thinks it's strange? That we don't know

00:22:02.559 --> 00:22:09.080
what the nature of a mind is. Yeah. If we
know the nature of our mind, then we are able

00:22:09.080 --> 00:22:15.549
to actually, uh, take a hold of our own happiness.
In general what it's considered in Buddhist

00:22:15.549 --> 00:22:20.820
psychology is that the mind is the key to
being happy. And happy you can define however

00:22:20.820 --> 00:22:31.720
you want, I don't care how you define it really.
It means, what, it means kind 

00:22:31.720 --> 00:22:36.710
of contentment, uh, ease, clarity, um, stability,
those are all things we don't have, I don't

00:22:36.710 --> 00:22:40.710
think. If you're like me, maybe you're not,
if you're like me, we don't have those things,

00:22:40.710 --> 00:22:46.510
ok. In general, our minds are up and down
up and down up and down and we're not very

00:22:46.510 --> 00:22:56.720
clear, most of us are not very clear. And
most of us don't even know what the mind is.

00:22:56.720 --> 00:23:00.529
And those of us who have studied who are sort
of involved in psychology at least we should

00:23:00.529 --> 00:23:09.379
know. It's kind of like being a hand surgeon
without knowing the nature of a hand. Ok.

00:23:09.379 --> 00:23:18.450
Oh, I just for the fun of it, I looked, I
tried to find out how many studies have done

00:23:18.450 --> 00:23:23.850
on mollusks. Don't ask me why mollusks, I
just, it was random. I couldn't find how many

00:23:23.850 --> 00:23:29.500
studies were done--. I googled it. Ok, and
I couldn't find how many I googled, you know,

00:23:29.500 --> 00:23:33.842
uh, mollusks. I didn't find out how many studies
were done, maybe if someone can ever find

00:23:33.842 --> 00:23:39.539
out I'd like to know. But I did find out there's
75000 kinds of mollusks. I thought that was

00:23:39.539 --> 00:23:44.741
amazing. I mean someone has counted that or
figured that out. Anyway the point was, what

00:23:44.741 --> 00:23:52.950
I did do I did do a search on uh, the hand.
And I know it's not scientific, but uh, if

00:23:52.950 --> 00:23:59.000
3 billion, I got 3 billion different sites
that I could go to that were associated with

00:23:59.000 --> 00:24:05.490
the hand. And but with the hand there were
only 2 billion. I think that is interesting.

00:24:05.490 --> 00:24:09.780
Um, I think the mind's more important, well
that's a value judgment. I should say it's

00:24:09.780 --> 00:24:18.450
more important. So the mind, but I want to
quote un Lama Yeshe. He says "The human mind

00:24:18.450 --> 00:24:26.750
has both positive and negative sides, but
the negative is transient, very temporary,

00:24:26.750 --> 00:24:33.200
your up and down emotions are like clouds
in the sky. Beyond them the real basic human

00:24:33.200 --> 00:24:41.341
nature is clear and pure."
That's pretty cool. Ok. Beyond them the human

00:24:41.341 --> 00:24:46.570
nature is clear and pure. This is because
you know I know that a lot of times when we

00:24:46.570 --> 00:24:53.110
look at Buddhist thought and Buddhist psychology,
there's a lot of talk about suffering, right?

00:24:53.110 --> 00:25:01.730
Yeah? The reason for that is not because that's
all there is the reason for that is that we

00:25:01.730 --> 00:25:09.360
don't understand how things are and it's only
by understanding the problem that we can actualize

00:25:09.360 --> 00:25:16.220
the solution. So you know sometimes it's a
little bit, uh, Buddhist therapy so to speak,

00:25:16.220 --> 00:25:23.639
it's a little bit intense because it um, it's
it does force us to deal with our stuff. It

00:25:23.639 --> 00:25:30.720
really does. So it's not for everybody, ok?
What I mean by that, is in the book, I get

00:25:30.720 --> 00:25:36.720
often asked, what did I mean by problems become
friends? Because that's in the book. And it's

00:25:36.720 --> 00:25:43.009
a little tricky thing to understand, it can
be tricky or not be tricky and I'll tell you

00:25:43.009 --> 00:25:53.210
why. For somebody who is a 'spiritual practitioner'
that idea is not difficult, that problems

00:25:53.210 --> 00:25:56.539
could be your friends. Now what do I mean
by spiritual practitioner? I have a very specific

00:25:56.539 --> 00:26:04.510
meaning about that. I think a spiritual practitioner
is anybody who is interested in and focused

00:26:04.510 --> 00:26:12.279
upon developing one's inner potential. Ok,
so I don't mean anything religious by spiritual.

00:26:12.279 --> 00:26:16.429
Because religions are religions. You could
be a religious person and not be spiritual,

00:26:16.429 --> 00:26:22.850
in my book. Ok? And you could you non-religious
and be very spiritual and you be involved

00:26:22.850 --> 00:26:27.889
in therapy, right? Therapy or coaching and
be very spiritual because you are really trying

00:26:27.889 --> 00:26:35.419
to figure out, you know, you're trying to
learn. To be a spiritual person means to learn

00:26:35.419 --> 00:26:40.889
about how we work internally. That's what
I think. And access in learning the correct

00:26:40.889 --> 00:26:45.970
stuff too, right? There's a lot of ideas out
there, I mean, their helpful, but maybe not

00:26:45.970 --> 00:26:53.409
helpful in the very long term. So if you are
engaged in or are interested in uh, developing

00:26:53.409 --> 00:26:58.679
and believe there's a inner potential that
we're not accessing and you're interested

00:26:58.679 --> 00:27:03.440
in that and you're pursuing it, then in my
book you're a spiritual person. And for the

00:27:03.440 --> 00:27:11.370
sake of uh, to get this out now, I mean, uh,
I we do a lot of work around people in work,

00:27:11.370 --> 00:27:17.070
businesses things like that. Why? This is
where we live. So does it mean you can't be

00:27:17.070 --> 00:27:22.480
a spiritual person when you are at work? No.
We believe as we get better, it's a , that's

00:27:22.480 --> 00:27:27.970
why we call ourselves, you know, you're a
practitioner, is that you have to practice

00:27:27.970 --> 00:27:33.360
this. So it's like why are problems our friends?
Because it's only through problems that the

00:27:33.360 --> 00:27:43.980
crap comes up. That's a generalization, ok,
but generally speaking, it's, in relationship,

00:27:43.980 --> 00:27:50.799
first of all with other people, a lot of the
times, we get upset, we get jealous, we get

00:27:50.799 --> 00:28:00.970
anxious, we get tired, we get impatient, we
become sad. All these things mostly by the

00:28:00.970 --> 00:28:04.289
way, in relation to other people and when
they're not in relation to other people, they'll,

00:28:04.289 --> 00:28:10.600
those are our problems. So, my definition
of happiness, now has changed over the years,

00:28:10.600 --> 00:28:16.299
it keeps changing actually. Uh, meaning, it
gets sort of more refined, I should say. It

00:28:16.299 --> 00:28:20.879
used to be, I remember my, one of my son years
ago asked me he said "Dad why don't you get

00:28:20.879 --> 00:28:27.090
stoned anymore? Why don't you smoke dope anymore?"
And I said "Because it doesn't make me feel

00:28:27.090 --> 00:28:35.409
better anymore." Right? So, it's kind of,
the bar changes and as the bar changes, that's

00:28:35.409 --> 00:28:43.940
where you aim for. Ethics. Another good question.
Ethics are not in my opinion are something

00:28:43.940 --> 00:28:49.399
that should imposed from above, or morality.
Ethics are something that work for you. So

00:28:49.399 --> 00:28:53.860
in terms of Buddhist ethics we don't certain
things only because they disturb the mind

00:28:53.860 --> 00:28:59.320
of myself and others. And what did I say the
opposite of happiness is? A disturbed mind.

00:28:59.320 --> 00:29:06.010
Ok? So because of very simple and very pragmatic
you don't, we don't, have to change all this

00:29:06.010 --> 00:29:11.870
stuff. Just do it slowly, like that's why
I have no moral qualms with getting stoned,

00:29:11.870 --> 00:29:18.899
it's not a moral thing. It has to deal with
it makes my happiness lower and I want to

00:29:18.899 --> 00:29:23.730
be happy just like everybody else. Ok? Not
everyone has that that's not their reality.

00:29:23.730 --> 00:29:28.650
That's my situation, ok? So it's just like
that. That's what ethics are. Ok, for lack

00:29:28.650 --> 00:29:33.960
of a better in case you're interested. I wasn't
going to go into that. Um, another thing Buddha

00:29:33.960 --> 00:29:44.419
said, he said, uh, he said "Everything has
mind in the lead, has mind in the forefront,

00:29:44.419 --> 00:29:52.509
is made by mind." Wow. I mean, if that's true,
we have to research it, see if it's true.

00:29:52.509 --> 00:29:57.369
We're focusing on the wrong things, in order
to be happy. So in order to be happy, of course,

00:29:57.369 --> 00:30:01.730
you go to work, it's not to be happy. You
turn your work into happiness. You turn your

00:30:01.730 --> 00:30:07.059
work into your spiritual path. That's my point.
I'm sorry, I lost my thread a little bit.

00:30:07.059 --> 00:30:12.799
Work and spirituality are interconnected,
it's up to you. If you use work, if you use

00:30:12.799 --> 00:30:17.591
your relationship with your partner, if you
use your relationship with your kids, if you

00:30:17.591 --> 00:30:22.659
use your relationship with the traffic out
there as a means to further develop yourself

00:30:22.659 --> 00:30:30.640
internally, work is a spiritual path. Ok.
And, we all want to do that anyway, because

00:30:30.640 --> 00:30:35.789
we do want to be happy and the mind is the
source of happiness. And the way we do it

00:30:35.789 --> 00:30:43.120
by just to give you the final equation on
that is when things arise, like uh, you know,

00:30:43.120 --> 00:30:47.070
anxiety because you have to turn in, you know,
a project you've been working on and you've

00:30:47.070 --> 00:30:53.299
got to present it in front of your team and
your boss and it's like anxiety and it's like.

00:30:53.299 --> 00:30:58.899
What happ- that is an opportunity to become
more spiritually developed, because you can

00:30:58.899 --> 00:31:05.210
you can look, you know, you can like do those
things about becoming calm or positive reinforcement,

00:31:05.210 --> 00:31:11.960
or have a beer, or whatever you do, right?
That's the outer approach. That's not the

00:31:11.960 --> 00:31:18.960
spiritual approach. The spiritual approach
is, the problem I'm having in this presentation

00:31:18.960 --> 00:31:27.929
is within me, it's my anxiety. It's my lack
of confidence, ok? So it's a mental construct,

00:31:27.929 --> 00:31:33.249
right? It's a mental so the only thing that
will really work to get rid of it long term

00:31:33.249 --> 00:31:40.850
is a mental approach. That's a spiritual person,
ok? It's also psychologically sound. It works.

00:31:40.850 --> 00:31:45.759
We become psychologically more healthy. Now
in the book I can't go into all the techniques,

00:31:45.759 --> 00:31:49.759
there's thousands of techniques we could talk
about, ok? And it's not really opportunity

00:31:49.759 --> 00:31:56.740
to but, main thing first thing we have to
do- How much time do I got? I do, I do want

00:31:56.740 --> 00:32:03.029
to share this, because I know people always
want techniques and tips. And um, and un that

00:32:03.029 --> 00:32:07.040
that what we need to do as a first--, I think
I offered four steps, one four step method

00:32:07.040 --> 00:32:12.690
in the book that talks about the first thing
we need to do is be aware that we have a choice.

00:32:12.690 --> 00:32:19.510
And generally speaking if you're like me,
we are in automatic pilot mode, right? We

00:32:19.510 --> 00:32:26.380
are not very conscious, we are not very aware,
we are not very mindful. If you're like me.

00:32:26.380 --> 00:32:31.869
And the beauty of this human life is that
we do have a choice to be mindful. And you

00:32:31.869 --> 00:32:37.629
don't, if we just just make that decision
it's like wow, this moment right now becomes

00:32:37.629 --> 00:32:43.999
extremely valuable and precious. And when
we don't do that, we just carry on as usual

00:32:43.999 --> 00:32:47.049
and then we die. Ok?
[Laughter]

00:32:47.049 --> 00:32:52.809
&gt;&gt;Karuna: Don't mean to sound dramatic, but
that is what happens. So so the first thing

00:32:52.809 --> 00:32:58.390
is to really go hey, wow, I have this beautiful,
beautiful opportunity precious life. Sure

00:32:58.390 --> 00:33:03.149
there is problems, I'm not talking about,
there are problems that's the nature of life.

00:33:03.149 --> 00:33:07.580
That's why Buddhism is kind of negative. It's
not that its negative, it just says that things

00:33:07.580 --> 00:33:13.990
are kind of negative. Problems don't go away
on their own. We're problem free today and

00:33:13.990 --> 00:33:18.720
then we have problems tomorrow, it's amazing.
And we have no control over it, the external

00:33:18.720 --> 00:33:23.850
stuff. And we try to control it, right? It's
very very fascinating and it's a great topic

00:33:23.850 --> 00:33:27.970
to discuss how we try to control suffering
on the outside. Doesn't mean we should stop

00:33:27.970 --> 00:33:34.320
doing those things by the way. We should try,
but we have to be conscious of our intentions,

00:33:34.320 --> 00:33:42.419
you know. So, um, and then they don't really
help the solution is something internal, ok?

00:33:42.419 --> 00:33:49.549
So the first step is just go I have a choice
of how this, how I am in this minute, in this

00:33:49.549 --> 00:33:53.970
moment, in this experience. If you're in traffic
and you're pissed off on the Bay Bridge, you

00:33:53.970 --> 00:34:00.300
have a choice, ok? When you go out to the
lunch area and you're really excited because

00:34:00.300 --> 00:34:04.490
yesterday they had what they have yesterday?
What was the special? Huh?

00:34:04.490 --> 00:34:07.690
&gt;&gt;Female #3: Mexican.
&gt;&gt;Karuna: Mexican! And you go, gosh I really,

00:34:07.690 --> 00:34:12.089
fish tacos, yeah, so you go, I really look
forward to those fish tacos. They actually

00:34:12.089 --> 00:34:16.210
have them again today because people loved
them yesterday and you go out there and they're

00:34:16.210 --> 00:34:22.139
all gone. What happens in the mind? The more
you thought about it from yesterday the more

00:34:22.139 --> 00:34:25.290
agitated the mind becomes. If you thought
about it, just how quickly the mind gets to

00:34:25.290 --> 00:34:29.530
agitated, ok? So then you start yelling for
them "Where's the fish tacos, is there anymore

00:34:29.530 --> 00:34:31.169
in the back?" Yeah, you know, like that.
[Laughter]

00:34:31.169 --> 00:34:35.520
&gt;&gt;Karuna: And because we have this default
mode that that's, there isn't anything wrong

00:34:35.520 --> 00:34:42.830
with having the fish tacos, but you see, we're
mislead. Misleading mind, ok, got that out

00:34:42.830 --> 00:34:47.560
there. We're mislead to think that's going
to make me happy and no one would say "Oh

00:34:47.560 --> 00:34:50.059
a fish taco's going to make me happy, what
are you talking about?" I'm talking about

00:34:50.059 --> 00:34:55.490
different understanding of the word happiness.
Because in that moment we're not making the

00:34:55.490 --> 00:35:03.589
choice to be different. We are on autopilot,
ok? We have a choice. Ok?

00:35:03.589 --> 00:35:09.250
Second step is, if I could find it. Oh, it's
I talk about is setting up the laboratory.

00:35:09.250 --> 00:35:13.970
So ever- a lot of people know about my influence
practice up there. Once you recognize that

00:35:13.970 --> 00:35:21.710
you have a choice, it sort of a create a gap
and you can just go to the breath. Ok, breath

00:35:21.710 --> 00:35:26.100
is always with us. And it, again, I I don't
have the time, but there's a technique, you

00:35:26.100 --> 00:35:30.490
know, we call it the A-B-C technique where
you just check the tension in your body, that's

00:35:30.490 --> 00:35:34.950
anatomy for A, A for Anatomy, B is for breath
so you just connect with your breath in the

00:35:34.950 --> 00:35:40.400
nostrils or your stomach. Don't change it
just it is what it is and it's on the fish

00:35:40.400 --> 00:35:43.930
tacos, you just found out and your breaths
going [inhales] like that, you just watch

00:35:43.930 --> 00:35:50.049
it, ok? And then the C stands for counting.
Just count the in and exhalation ok? When

00:35:50.049 --> 00:35:55.580
you go one if you could do up to ten and then
you turn it around and you go back to one,

00:35:55.580 --> 00:36:02.960
ok? This is again just a little more solid
technique and then uh, that's just this uh,

00:36:02.960 --> 00:36:09.450
four steps, you get the mind a little bit
out of its reactive mode. Ok? The third is

00:36:09.450 --> 00:36:14.760
uh, you know you look at what's going on.
This is powerful is that you just identify

00:36:14.760 --> 00:36:21.819
your emotion, ok? And in Buddha psychology
the problems we have are really related to

00:36:21.819 --> 00:36:28.260
uh, we have these afflicted, or disturbing
emotions. And there what's run the show, we're

00:36:28.260 --> 00:36:35.520
not in control of the mind, the mind is in
control of us. That is not, that's not right.

00:36:35.520 --> 00:36:42.810
We should be in control of the mind, not the
afflicted disturbing emotions. Ok? You know,

00:36:42.810 --> 00:36:50.359
if you really think about it, there is nothing
much preventing us in the next minute of being

00:36:50.359 --> 00:36:57.040
in total fear, or totally taken over by rage,
or totally taken over by jealousy. It doesn't

00:36:57.040 --> 00:37:03.440
take much, it happens like that. And once
you're in it, it's like a virus, right, it's

00:37:03.440 --> 00:37:08.640
hard to get rid of. Ok? This is what we're
talking about, this is what we're saying,

00:37:08.640 --> 00:37:14.350
we don't have to be that way. There is, we
can actually live this life where we're in

00:37:14.350 --> 00:37:20.170
control. Now and, it's not easy. It takes
time, lot of time and by the way, you get

00:37:20.170 --> 00:37:25.210
better, you don't actually, when you're fully
healed, you're like you know those, like the

00:37:25.210 --> 00:37:31.520
dalai Lama. So let's not, you know, can't
get too unrealistic. We can get there and

00:37:31.520 --> 00:37:38.260
I would say in my lot of years of doing this,
35 or whatever years I am a better, I'm better.

00:37:38.260 --> 00:37:44.680
Not there yet, but I'm better, no doubt. Ok?
So and I think my friends are and people who

00:37:44.680 --> 00:37:52.710
try to, so, um, but that so that's the second
the third step. It's like identify what emotions

00:37:52.710 --> 00:37:55.670
are arising, because when you name it, what
happens when you name it, is you objectify

00:37:55.670 --> 00:38:01.650
it. When we objectify it, ok, when we don't
objectify, do you know like when you get if

00:38:01.650 --> 00:38:09.270
you get like agitated or angry anxious, or
depressed it's very interesting psychological,

00:38:09.270 --> 00:38:16.450
um, condition where we merge with the depression
don't we? We merge with the anger. It's like

00:38:16.450 --> 00:38:23.380
I'm angry. When we say I'm angry, there's
no subject object. The linguistics of I'm

00:38:23.380 --> 00:38:30.390
angry is subject object, isn't it? I is the
subject. We can see anger and I and we say

00:38:30.390 --> 00:38:36.090
I am angry. But the conception is I merge
with it, I am one with anger. There's no way

00:38:36.090 --> 00:38:41.510
I can say I'm angry if you merged. I mean,
I don't wanna go, it's-- Think about it. In

00:38:41.510 --> 00:38:46.730
if you are it, you can't see yourself, ok?
So obviously you are not the anger, but we're

00:38:46.730 --> 00:38:51.700
so confused. So we say I'm angry. For the
degree of subjectivity by the way, there's

00:38:51.700 --> 00:38:58.359
more control. That's what we're looking for.
So we objectify the disturbing emotions and

00:38:58.359 --> 00:39:03.720
by the way because I only have a short time,
there are positive emotions too. The job is

00:39:03.720 --> 00:39:12.940
to uh, develop the positive emotions. Unfortunately
for some reason the negative afflictive do

00:39:12.940 --> 00:39:18.230
run, are more powerful in this in the sense
that we're more habituate, but we all know

00:39:18.230 --> 00:39:21.780
people who are compassionate right? WE all
know people who are wise, we all know people

00:39:21.780 --> 00:39:27.109
who are kind, empathetic. Those are some of
the positive emotions. There are, but it gets,

00:39:27.109 --> 00:39:34.630
the idea is, we got to rid the mind of those
ones that take over, which are anger, jealousy,

00:39:34.630 --> 00:39:43.210
desire, confusion, things like that, anxiety.
Ok? Um, the fourth step is you take some action,

00:39:43.210 --> 00:39:48.020
so you're there. And actions that you can
take when the afflictive minds are arising

00:39:48.020 --> 00:39:53.089
are lots of different things, I can't give
you just one right here, um, I don't mean

00:39:53.089 --> 00:39:57.900
to do that, uh, but there are a few in the
book or somewhere else. But the point is that

00:39:57.900 --> 00:40:06.100
um, with action comes inquiry. Ok I want to
really stress that. I'm not, I really respect

00:40:06.100 --> 00:40:11.559
the whole mindfulness movement is great. But
I think something is missing that we can add

00:40:11.559 --> 00:40:17.359
to people. Once you develop a calm mind, it's
not a not, we can do more. And the thir- the

00:40:17.359 --> 00:40:24.720
last, the more is inquiry. What I mean by
that is, uh, to inquire to the nature of what's

00:40:24.720 --> 00:40:30.900
going on. So let's say you're getting really
angry. You know, you're really agitated, agitated.

00:40:30.900 --> 00:40:35.020
So one of the things you can be, we have an
inquiry about, is how does that anger really

00:40:35.020 --> 00:40:39.990
exist? You know how I was talking about subject
to object, if you just inquire about that,

00:40:39.990 --> 00:40:47.359
what happens to the anger, does anyone know?
Dissipates. The inquiry itself is a powerful

00:40:47.359 --> 00:40:54.050
antidote. Ok. And so when we inquire about
the nature of this, and then you can say,

00:40:54.050 --> 00:41:00.500
oh, I'm angry. Well just like we did in the
beginning earlier about the mind, I am angry.

00:41:00.500 --> 00:41:06.079
We say it all the time. What is that I? We
just take it for granted. But if you really

00:41:06.079 --> 00:41:12.330
start looking for it, it's very interesting.
Very very interesting. And we have, by the

00:41:12.330 --> 00:41:21.930
way, we have multiple I's, I's, I's. Multiple
I's, we are multi personality disordered.

00:41:21.930 --> 00:41:32.020
Ok, I'm a father, I'm a husband, I'm a author,
I'm a therapist, I'm a coach, I'm angry, I'm

00:41:32.020 --> 00:41:39.320
agitated, I'm nervous, I'm afraid, I mean
we've got it all through the day, right? Right?

00:41:39.320 --> 00:41:43.951
So there's positive ones and there's more
negative ones. And I think that I think I

00:41:43.951 --> 00:41:47.340
must be running out of time.
&gt;&gt;Female Announcer: You've got about two minutes.

00:41:47.340 --> 00:41:52.200
&gt;&gt;Karuna: Two minutes, Oh! Questions! Ten
minutes for questions. Um, I really like questions,

00:41:52.200 --> 00:41:56.190
I hope there's some questions. Uh-oh.
[Laughter]

00:41:56.190 --> 00:42:01.599
&gt;&gt;Karuna: I'll just keep talking and I don't
want to do that. Yeah.

00:42:01.599 --> 00:42:09.579
&gt;&gt;Male #3:: Uh, alright, I'm not sure what
to ask, alright I'll ask this question, what

00:42:09.579 --> 00:42:16.069
would you define, it seems like you focus
more on Tibetan Buddhism. Right?

00:42:16.069 --> 00:42:17.069
&gt;&gt;Karuna: Yes.

00:42:17.069 --> 00:42:21.320
&gt;&gt;Male #3: [inaudible]
&gt;&gt;Karuna: Yes, Ok, so you were asking about

00:42:21.320 --> 00:42:25.870
yeah, you were asking about uh that I speak
mainly from the Tibetan tradition which is

00:42:25.870 --> 00:42:30.950
true and what is the difference or some differences
about the Tibetan tradition from other traditions.

00:42:30.950 --> 00:42:34.319
&gt;&gt;Male #3: Yes, why are you more invested
more so in the Tibetan tradition?

00:42:34.319 --> 00:42:40.700
&gt;&gt;Karuna: Ok why I am more invested in Tibetan
than in other traditions. Um, that's correct,

00:42:40.700 --> 00:42:45.340
I'll answer the last part of the question
first, the reason is only because of luck.

00:42:45.340 --> 00:42:52.069
I was in Nepal and the system of Buddhism
in Nepal it just so happens I, I found myself

00:42:52.069 --> 00:42:56.670
living with Tibetan refugees. And that was
at Tibet, that monastery I mentioned to you,

00:42:56.670 --> 00:43:02.680
Kopan Monastery was a Tibetan, it was it wasn't
only Tibetan, but the founders were Tibetan

00:43:02.680 --> 00:43:08.510
refugees and so many of the monks were from
Tibetan families. Or in Nepal you have a lot

00:43:08.510 --> 00:43:14.130
of tribes, a lot of tribes are really other
than political reasons their Tibetan. You

00:43:14.130 --> 00:43:20.690
know, Sherpa's for example, Sherpa language
is a dialect of Tibet, we had a lot of Sherpa,

00:43:20.690 --> 00:43:26.660
uh, um, Sherpa, um, monks. So so for me personally
was that's where I was. I tried to study all

00:43:26.660 --> 00:43:31.790
a lot of the traditions, um, you know the
only, so I can only speak from that point

00:43:31.790 --> 00:43:40.559
view. Now, in Buddhist approach there are
two primary, uh, traditions we could say.

00:43:40.559 --> 00:43:45.380
But there, uh, one is the Theravada tradition
which is sometimes referred to as the southern

00:43:45.380 --> 00:43:50.640
school. And the other is the Mahayana tradition
of which Tibetan Buddhism is part of, uh,

00:43:50.640 --> 00:43:57.750
Buddhism in China, Korea, Japan, uh, Vietnam,
whereas Burma, and Thailand and Sri Lanka

00:43:57.750 --> 00:44:06.130
are of the Theravada tradition. And so, for
me, um, it, the the Tibetan tradition offers

00:44:06.130 --> 00:44:14.430
more philosophical ideas. For example people
refer to Tantra and Vasryana, that's something

00:44:14.430 --> 00:44:20.200
very uh, linked with Tibetan tradition. So
it's it's just it's somewhat more extensive.

00:44:20.200 --> 00:44:27.109
They're inclusive, by the way, the Mahayana
tradition, it includes the Theravada tradition.

00:44:27.109 --> 00:44:28.431
You know and the teachings I should say. Yeah.
&gt;&gt;Female #4: Um I'm curious like at what point

00:44:28.431 --> 00:44:32.099
with your study of Buddhism did you decide
to turn to a study of psychology. I was actually

00:44:32.099 --> 00:44:33.730
a psychology/religion double major.

00:44:33.730 --> 00:44:38.230
&gt;&gt;Karuna: Uh-huh.
&gt;&gt;Female #4: I was always trying to get to

00:44:38.230 --> 00:44:44.770
that point like, where psychology was religion,
or took a lot of Buddhism classes. And like

00:44:44.770 --> 00:44:50.089
the psychology of Buddhism. And like, was
there a defining moment or [inaudible]?

00:44:50.089 --> 00:44:56.789
&gt;&gt;Karuna: Ah ha, so the question was uh, was
there a defining moment uh, when I uh, decided

00:44:56.789 --> 00:45:02.810
to study psychology as opposed to religion?
Yeah. Um, well fortunately, I listened to

00:45:02.810 --> 00:45:09.599
Lama Yeshe very carefully, I got the, got
it, that that Buddhist thought was about wasn't

00:45:09.599 --> 00:45:14.390
really religious. There was religious parts,
but it's really a psychology and so I think

00:45:14.390 --> 00:45:19.470
I studying psychology long before I came back
here and I was, I just loved it. I loved the

00:45:19.470 --> 00:45:25.450
depth, uh, in Buddhist psychology, it's it's
very vast, I mean, just you know not to leave

00:45:25.450 --> 00:45:30.190
you hanging it's not something interpretive.
It is a system of psychology, the mind is

00:45:30.190 --> 00:45:35.369
explained, mental disorders are explained,
how experience arises, all it's very, very

00:45:35.369 --> 00:45:43.130
vast and very, very in-depth, ah, the when
I came back here. I really wasn't I, I thought

00:45:43.130 --> 00:45:49.170
I'd like western psychology but I found it
um, you know, I had I don't know what to say,

00:45:49.170 --> 00:45:53.730
it's very useful in terms of applications,
like particularly in terms of crisis management.

00:45:53.730 --> 00:45:58.700
Um, very useful in terms of helping us you
know, understanding how to communicate better

00:45:58.700 --> 00:46:03.170
you know, Buddhist psychology doesn't really
go into that. Um, but as a theory, I didn't

00:46:03.170 --> 00:46:07.589
find much as much use. So I don't know if
there was a defining moment, I think the defining

00:46:07.589 --> 00:46:13.049
moment happened long before I came back. Studying
psychology here was really sort of a pragmatic

00:46:13.049 --> 00:46:14.990
decision. Does that answer your question?
Yeah. Yeah

00:46:14.990 --> 00:46:22.799
&gt;&gt;Female #5: So you talked about integrating
spirituality into work and your paths, so

00:46:22.799 --> 00:46:31.589
how can anyone, you know watching you speak
whether you are at Google somewhere else,

00:46:31.589 --> 00:46:34.800
um, integrate that or try to incorporate that
across a company?

00:46:34.800 --> 00:46:41.619
&gt;&gt;Karuna: Oh yeah, uh, so, so Rachel was asking
how to integrate more around developing spiritual

00:46:41.619 --> 00:46:52.010
approach to ones work, right? Throughout Google
we could just say. Um, Hah, um, have a conversation

00:46:52.010 --> 00:46:56.710
with me about that? I mean, the, the there's
many things and I think the main thing is

00:46:56.710 --> 00:46:59.230
develop a more mindful organization, ok.
&gt;&gt;Female #5: How do we do that as like a people

00:46:59.230 --> 00:47:03.290
in the organization?
&gt;&gt;Karuna: Oh people in the organization how

00:47:03.290 --> 00:47:08.940
do they do that? Well, um, you really need
instruction. The first thing is instruction,

00:47:08.940 --> 00:47:13.520
uh, we offer, for example, I don't know if
I can promote, but we do offer a corporate

00:47:13.520 --> 00:47:18.410
based mindfulness training program that is
designed for people in the workplace. That's

00:47:18.410 --> 00:47:22.660
the beginning, the first thing is develop
a mindful approach, but I want to just make

00:47:22.660 --> 00:47:30.410
my soapbox issue that it goes beyond that.
First my becoming a more mindful organization

00:47:30.410 --> 00:47:33.539
through a training, I don't know who else
does that, but I'm sure there's other people.

00:47:33.539 --> 00:47:40.279
But you need to have a program and our program
we work with organizations for eight, for

00:47:40.279 --> 00:47:44.060
actually four months and develop people to
become their own trainers, which is one of

00:47:44.060 --> 00:47:48.930
our strong beliefs. Also in my book and also,
my book, this idea that Lama Yeshe was very

00:47:48.930 --> 00:47:55.279
strong was, he had this phrase you need to
become your own therapist. And that's what

00:47:55.279 --> 00:47:59.760
my goal, I hope I can help people do that,
you know get me out of a job. So in a same

00:47:59.760 --> 00:48:06.360
thing organizations our programs model that
philosophy. Um, after mindful- it is very

00:48:06.360 --> 00:48:10.539
important to become a more mindful organization,
because what happens in a mindful organizations

00:48:10.539 --> 00:48:15.840
is there's a lot natural empathy develops,
natural listening develops, uh, natural um,

00:48:15.840 --> 00:48:22.640
natural self-awareness, you know. Uh, when
we do, emotional intelligence surveys for

00:48:22.640 --> 00:48:27.710
leaders, one of the prime competencies of
course, is self-awareness. And there is, we

00:48:27.710 --> 00:48:33.011
have lots of data showing that that self-awareness
does develop, empathy does develop, through

00:48:33.011 --> 00:48:37.720
mindfulness practice and you know, the right
kind of mindfulness practice. So, um, I'm

00:48:37.720 --> 00:48:42.560
all for it, I think it, you're in a great
organization, right here that's uh, cutting

00:48:42.560 --> 00:48:48.549
edge and it's just really, really a thrill
to have a, a shared mindset around the these

00:48:48.549 --> 00:48:52.910
ideas. I just really feel very honored. So
I want to thank you for that. Thank all the

00:48:52.910 --> 00:48:58.011
Google-ites for that . Yeah. Question? Come
on, one more? Yeah.

00:48:58.011 --> 00:48:59.011
&gt;&gt;Male #4: [inaudible] but from like a spiritual
perspective, is there like one thing you'd

00:48:59.011 --> 00:49:06.840
recommend starting today or tomorrow to become
more spiritual? [inaudible]

00:49:06.840 --> 00:49:14.960
&gt;&gt;Karuna: The question was is there one thing
on a individual level that we could do to

00:49:14.960 --> 00:49:22.549
just start the process of becoming more aware.
Uh, yes, I there is there is a requirement

00:49:22.549 --> 00:49:29.190
for this and I'm not going to pull any, what's
that expression? Pull any punches. You have,

00:49:29.190 --> 00:49:35.170
we have to be engaged in some kind of mind
training, ok. Which means we have to begin

00:49:35.170 --> 00:49:43.661
to turn our uh, the default automatic approach
around. The way to do that is we have to do

00:49:43.661 --> 00:49:48.050
it, we have to at least have some sort of,
when I say mind training, it doesn't have

00:49:48.050 --> 00:49:55.140
to just be meditation, but it has to be something
that really trains me, and eventually meditation.

00:49:55.140 --> 00:49:57.589
Because what do you call meditation, whatever
you like to call it, I like to call it mind

00:49:57.589 --> 00:50:02.440
training. So the first thing to do, what I
would suggest people do, if they're just going

00:50:02.440 --> 00:50:09.460
to start, is do that ABCD method that I talked
about. Do it at your desk or wherever you

00:50:09.460 --> 00:50:14.430
work and watch. The only thing we need to
do, well not the only thing, but the first

00:50:14.430 --> 00:50:20.430
thing and the thing we do from beginning middle
to end is to be curious and so what you're

00:50:20.430 --> 00:50:26.329
doing is I going to watch my mind like I'd
watch the Olympics. Ok, you know in the Olympics

00:50:26.329 --> 00:50:30.789
they tell how "Now here's how he does—"
they go into all the dialog and explanation.

00:50:30.789 --> 00:50:39.190
We want that stuff. But we don't we just watch.
And so it's more like, just become a learner.

00:50:39.190 --> 00:50:44.640
And your, your what you're learning is your
mind. So you have to, it's just about watching

00:50:44.640 --> 00:50:49.529
it right now and to watch it you have to quiet
it. In other words, if we just sit, we don't

00:50:49.529 --> 00:50:52.819
have time but if we just sit and said everyone
watch your mind. How long do you think you'd

00:50:52.819 --> 00:50:55.029
be watching your mind? Anybody have anything?
&gt;&gt;Female Announcer: A few seconds.

00:50:55.029 --> 00:50:59.682
&gt;&gt;Karuna: It's a few seconds! Is that, I think
that that's what's the word for me, someone

00:50:59.682 --> 00:51:05.760
help me with the adjective, that's not a that's
pathetic, uh, hah?

00:51:05.760 --> 00:51:08.069
&gt;&gt;Audience members: Preposterous

00:51:08.069 --> 00:51:11.869
&gt;&gt;Karuna: Preposterous! That's perfect. That's
preposterous! We've had this mind for twenty,

00:51:11.869 --> 00:51:20.339
thirty, forty, fifty whatever years and we
can't watch it for more than a few seconds?

00:51:20.339 --> 00:51:26.880
But we can develop that. So focus, so if when
the first thing you do is focus on the breath,

00:51:26.880 --> 00:51:31.760
do the counting that I was talking about and
if you can do that and you bring your mind

00:51:31.760 --> 00:51:35.200
back, you notice the distractions, that's
all you need to do in the beginning. 'Cause

00:51:35.200 --> 00:51:42.670
there's ABCD, I didn't tell you the D. The
D is notice distractions. There's also an

00:51:42.670 --> 00:51:51.309
E, it comes later. [Laughter] Yeah, part two.
Ok? So I am good? Well good. Ok, I think that's

00:51:51.309 --> 00:51:52.670
it. Thank you very much. Thank you.

00:51:52.670 --> 00:51:52.760
[applause]
