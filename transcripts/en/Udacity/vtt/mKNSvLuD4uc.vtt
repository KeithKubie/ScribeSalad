00:00:00.550 --> 00:00:03.370
Here's the state of our knowledge
about NP-complete problems,

00:00:03.370 --> 00:00:06.280
given just what we proved
in the last lesson.

00:00:06.280 --> 00:00:09.520
We've shown that we can take
an arbitrary problem in NP and

00:00:09.520 --> 00:00:12.270
reduce it to CNF satisfied ability.

00:00:12.270 --> 00:00:14.450
That's what the Cook-Levin theorem said.

00:00:14.450 --> 00:00:18.380
We did do another polynomial reduction,
one of the independent set or

00:00:18.380 --> 00:00:21.320
clique problem to
the vertex cover problem.

00:00:21.320 --> 00:00:22.750
Again, I'm treating Clique and

00:00:22.750 --> 00:00:25.860
Independent Set here as one because
the problems are so similar.

00:00:26.940 --> 00:00:29.590
Much of the lesson will be
concerned with connecting up

00:00:29.590 --> 00:00:31.720
these two links into a chain.

00:00:31.720 --> 00:00:37.010
First, we're going to reduce
general CNF SAT to 3-CNF SAT.

00:00:37.010 --> 00:00:40.030
Where each clause has
exactly three literals.

00:00:40.030 --> 00:00:43.140
This is a critical reduction
because 3 SAT is much

00:00:43.140 --> 00:00:47.160
easier to reduce to other
problems than general CNF SAT.

00:00:47.160 --> 00:00:51.050
Then we're going to reduce
3-CNF to independent set and

00:00:51.050 --> 00:00:55.210
by transitivity this will show that
this whole chain here is NP complete.

00:00:56.370 --> 00:00:59.160
Note that this is very convenient
because it would have been pretty messy

00:00:59.160 --> 00:01:03.760
to try to reduce every problem to
NP to these problems directly.

00:01:03.760 --> 00:01:08.240
Finally, we will reduce 3-CNF
SAT to the Subset Sum problem

00:01:08.240 --> 00:01:11.630
to give you a fuller sense of the types
of arguments that go into reductions.
