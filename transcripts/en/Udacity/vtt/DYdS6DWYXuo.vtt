00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.000
And the answer is the main diagonal remains one.

00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:07.000
This expresses the effect that in the absence of any velocity,

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:10.000
we expect the x-coordinate and the y-coordinate not to change.

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:13.000
We also don't expect the velocities to change.

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:19.000
But the x-velocity will impact the x-position through a 0.1 over here.

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:23.000
The third coordinate is the velocity, and it affects the first coordinate.

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:30.000
The same over here. All the other values should be zero.

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:33.000
So this is the 4-dimensionalization

00:00:33.000 --> 09:59:59.000
of this 2-dimensional state-transition matrix over here.
