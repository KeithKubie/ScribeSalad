view it's a perspective that takes a
big-picture view and you know when we

big-picture view and you know when we
 

00:00:12.809 --> 00:00:15.410

zoom out and see our planet from space a

and I think it's it's a acknowledgment
 

00:00:24.420 --> 00:00:26.660
and I think it's it's a acknowledgment
that we don't have to accept the status

this this magnificent sight and after we
 

00:01:38.130 --> 00:01:39.469
this this magnificent sight and after we
undocked we did a couple of laps around

00:01:39.469 --> 00:01:39.479
undocked we did a couple of laps around
 

00:01:39.479 --> 00:01:41.870
undocked we did a couple of laps around
around the planet and as we passed the

we fired our engines just a little bit

00:01:54.289 --> 00:01:54.299
we fired our engines just a little bit
 

00:01:54.299 --> 00:01:56.300
we fired our engines just a little bit
at the precisely the right moment to

00:01:56.300 --> 00:01:56.310
at the precisely the right moment to
 

00:01:56.310 --> 00:01:58.249
at the precisely the right moment to
have us enter the upper atmosphere and

00:01:58.249 --> 00:01:58.259
have us enter the upper atmosphere and
 

00:01:58.259 --> 00:01:59.780
have us enter the upper atmosphere and
as we enter the upness of our atmosphere

00:01:59.780 --> 00:01:59.790
as we enter the upness of our atmosphere
 

00:01:59.790 --> 00:02:02.660
as we enter the upness of our atmosphere
we started to develop drag you know we

00:02:02.660 --> 00:02:02.670
we started to develop drag you know we
 

00:02:02.670 --> 00:02:05.300

had this fiery violent ride through the

00:02:05.300 --> 00:02:05.310
had this fiery violent ride through the
 

00:02:05.310 --> 00:02:07.880
had this fiery violent ride through the
atmosphere it was it was really amazing

00:02:07.880 --> 00:02:07.890
atmosphere it was it was really amazing
 

00:02:07.890 --> 00:02:09.889
atmosphere it was it was really amazing
once you got down to a lower altitude

00:02:09.889 --> 00:02:09.899
once you got down to a lower altitude
 

00:02:09.899 --> 00:02:12.090
once you got down to a lower altitude
the speed really

00:02:12.090 --> 00:02:12.100
the speed really
 

00:02:12.100 --> 00:02:14.040
the speed really
becomes amazing and I remember seeing no

00:02:14.040 --> 00:02:14.050
becomes amazing and I remember seeing no
 

00:02:14.050 --> 00:02:15.660

throw us all over the place

00:02:19.790 --> 00:02:19.800
throw us all over the place
 

00:02:19.800 --> 00:02:23.040
throw us all over the place
shortly thereafter we smashed into the

00:02:23.040 --> 00:02:23.050
shortly thereafter we smashed into the
 

00:02:23.050 --> 00:02:25.290
shortly thereafter we smashed into the
ground we bounced we flipped we rolled

00:02:25.290 --> 00:02:25.300
ground we bounced we flipped we rolled
 

00:02:25.300 --> 00:02:28.050
ground we bounced we flipped we rolled
over and when we rolled over we rolled

00:02:28.050 --> 00:02:28.060
over and when we rolled over we rolled
 

00:02:28.060 --> 00:02:30.780
over and when we rolled over we rolled
on the right side and now my window was

00:02:30.780 --> 00:02:30.790
on the right side and now my window was
 

00:02:30.790 --> 00:02:32.520
on the right side and now my window was
pointing it at the ground and I remember

00:02:32.520 --> 00:02:32.530
pointing it at the ground and I remember
 

00:02:32.530 --> 00:02:33.570
pointing it at the ground and I remember
looking out of the window

00:02:33.570 --> 00:02:33.580
looking out of the window
 

00:02:33.580 --> 00:02:36.600
looking out of the window
and seeing a rock of flour and a blade

00:02:36.600 --> 00:02:36.610
and seeing a rock of flour and a blade
 

00:02:36.610 --> 00:02:38.250
and seeing a rock of flour and a blade
of grass and I remember thinking to

00:02:38.250 --> 00:02:38.260
of grass and I remember thinking to
 

00:02:38.260 --> 00:02:41.400
of grass and I remember thinking to
myself distinctly that I'm home and what

00:02:41.400 --> 00:02:41.410
myself distinctly that I'm home and what
 

00:02:41.410 --> 00:02:43.200
myself distinctly that I'm home and what
was really amazing about that that

00:02:43.200 --> 00:02:43.210
was really amazing about that that
 

00:02:43.210 --> 00:02:45.930
was really amazing about that that
thought was that I was in Kazakhstan and

00:02:45.930 --> 00:02:45.940
thought was that I was in Kazakhstan and
 

00:02:45.940 --> 00:02:48.360
thought was that I was in Kazakhstan and
so for me at that moment my home was no

00:02:48.360 --> 00:02:48.370
so for me at that moment my home was no
 

00:02:48.370 --> 00:02:50.340
so for me at that moment my home was no
longer Houston Texas where I live with

00:02:50.340 --> 00:02:50.350
longer Houston Texas where I live with
 

00:02:50.350 --> 00:02:52.080
longer Houston Texas where I live with
my family or Yonkers New York where I

00:02:52.080 --> 00:02:52.090
my family or Yonkers New York where I
 

00:02:52.090 --> 00:02:54.030
my family or Yonkers New York where I
was born and grew up my homeless birth

00:02:54.030 --> 00:02:54.040
was born and grew up my homeless birth
 

00:02:54.040 --> 00:02:55.680
was born and grew up my homeless birth
and it was really a perspective shifting

00:02:55.680 --> 00:02:55.690
and it was really a perspective shifting
 

00:02:55.690 --> 00:02:58.380
and it was really a perspective shifting
moment for me so one of the big tenets

00:02:58.380 --> 00:02:58.390
moment for me so one of the big tenets
 

00:02:58.390 --> 00:03:00.890
moment for me so one of the big tenets
of the book and and the reason why I

00:03:00.890 --> 00:03:00.900
of the book and and the reason why I
 

00:03:00.900 --> 00:03:03.450
of the book and and the reason why I
cites and tell so many stories about

cites and tell so many stories about
 

00:03:03.460 --> 00:03:05.700

understand the framework that we've

00:03:27.060 --> 00:03:27.070
understand the framework that we've
 

00:03:27.070 --> 00:03:29.820
understand the framework that we've
built to view the world in now we live

00:03:29.820 --> 00:03:29.830
built to view the world in now we live
 

00:03:29.830 --> 00:03:31.199
built to view the world in now we live
as we all know in a very very

as we all know in a very very
 

00:03:31.209 --> 00:03:33.090
as we all know in a very very
complicated world there's so many

are our global society face but our

self-sacrifice and so it becomes very
 

00:03:50.320 --> 00:03:51.960
self-sacrifice and so it becomes very
complicated and what we tend to do is

00:03:51.960 --> 00:03:51.970
complicated and what we tend to do is
 

00:03:51.970 --> 00:03:54.510
complicated and what we tend to do is
and myself included we tend to build a

and myself included we tend to build a
 

00:03:54.520 --> 00:03:57.030
and myself included we tend to build a
more simplified framework through which

00:03:57.030 --> 00:03:57.040
more simplified framework through which
 

00:03:57.040 --> 00:03:59.250

to view the world through which to view

to view the world through which to view
our global society and when we do that

00:04:01.620 --> 00:04:01.630
our global society and when we do that
 

00:04:01.630 --> 00:04:03.660
our global society and when we do that
we tend to build cubby holes and put

00:04:03.660 --> 00:04:03.670
we tend to build cubby holes and put
 

00:04:03.670 --> 00:04:05.880
we tend to build cubby holes and put
people and groups into certain cubby

00:04:05.880 --> 00:04:05.890
people and groups into certain cubby

what that does is it also creates

00:04:16.560 --> 00:04:16.570
what that does is it also creates

what that does is it also creates
barriers and walls we box ourselves into

just mean you know people and

where we've become so divided and to the

where we've become so divided and to the
 

00:05:00.719 --> 00:05:03.559
where we've become so divided and to the
point where one side will refuse to

we lose if they gain we lose and so I

00:05:09.920 --> 00:05:09.930
we lose if they gain we lose and so I

a recipe for not being able to have

a recipe for not being able to have
progress it's it's a barrier to us being

progress it's it's a barrier to us being
 

00:05:19.500 --> 00:05:21.860
progress it's it's a barrier to us being
able to tackle the big problems and so I
