00:00:09.450 --> 00:00:11.450
- [Narrator] We are the paradoxical ape.

00:00:12.370 --> 00:00:16.736
Bipedal, naked, large-brained.

00:00:16.736 --> 00:00:20.713
Long the master of fire,
tools, and language,

00:00:21.630 --> 00:00:24.023
but still trying to understand ourselves.

00:00:25.900 --> 00:00:30.883
Aware that death is inevitable,
yet filled with optimism.

00:00:32.500 --> 00:00:33.683
We grow up slowly.

00:00:34.850 --> 00:00:36.243
We hand down knowledge.

00:00:37.450 --> 00:00:39.273
We empathize and deceive.

00:00:40.910 --> 00:00:42.410
We shape the future from our

00:00:42.410 --> 00:00:44.693
shared understanding of the past.

00:00:46.390 --> 00:00:50.160
CARTA brings together experts
from diverse disciplines

00:00:50.160 --> 00:00:54.473
to exchange insights on who
we are and how we got here,

00:00:56.370 --> 00:00:57.960
an exploration made possible

00:00:57.960 --> 00:01:00.737
by the generosity of humans like you.

00:01:35.101 --> 00:01:36.820
- I'm very happy to be here today

00:01:36.820 --> 00:01:40.140
to talk about a topic that's
very near and dear to my heart,

00:01:40.140 --> 00:01:43.633
which is the role of
technology in human evolution.

00:01:45.520 --> 00:01:48.950
In fact, if you go back about 60 years,

00:01:48.950 --> 00:01:52.950
it was a pretty much widespread viewpoint

00:01:52.950 --> 00:01:55.930
that technology and toolmaking

00:01:55.930 --> 00:01:58.990
was absolutely central to human evolution,

00:01:58.990 --> 00:02:02.103
and in fact perhaps
definitive of our species.

00:02:04.021 --> 00:02:07.200
This was graphically
represented film in 1968,

00:02:09.450 --> 00:02:12.300
2001: A Space Odyssey, which depicts

00:02:12.300 --> 00:02:15.820
this critical turning
point in human evolution

00:02:15.820 --> 00:02:19.280
when this Australopithecine
male, of course,

00:02:19.280 --> 00:02:21.530
realizing that he can use a bone as a club

00:02:21.530 --> 00:02:24.073
and then proceeds to
slaughter his rivals with it.

00:02:24.980 --> 00:02:28.300
From then, our future was
assured and virtually inevitable.

00:02:28.300 --> 00:02:31.953
In triumph he tosses
the bone up in the air,

00:02:31.953 --> 00:02:35.880
spins around, and then,
on the way back down,

00:02:35.880 --> 00:02:39.406
it very smoothly, at least
in 1960s cinematography,

00:02:39.406 --> 00:02:42.220
turns into a spaceship.

00:02:42.220 --> 00:02:44.223
So you get the picture, right?

00:02:45.070 --> 00:02:48.160
But already by the time
that this film had come out,

00:02:48.160 --> 00:02:50.870
and you saw this quote
in the last presentation,

00:02:50.870 --> 00:02:52.600
this vision of man the toolmaker

00:02:52.600 --> 00:02:54.570
had started to unravel a bit.

00:02:54.570 --> 00:02:57.327
As Louis Leakey famously quipped,

00:02:57.327 --> 00:02:59.637
"Now we must redefine man, redefine tool,

00:02:59.637 --> 00:03:01.850
"or accept chimpanzees as human."

00:03:01.850 --> 00:03:04.920
And in fact, now we know it's
not just the chimpanzees,

00:03:04.920 --> 00:03:06.420
it's not even just the primates.

00:03:06.420 --> 00:03:08.230
If you're willing to accept

00:03:08.230 --> 00:03:10.960
kind of covering yourself
with a coconut as tool use,

00:03:10.960 --> 00:03:14.130
it goes into molluscs even using tools.

00:03:14.130 --> 00:03:17.810
And as archeologists, we
also know that the earliest

00:03:17.810 --> 00:03:20.680
appearance of flake stone
tools was not really

00:03:20.680 --> 00:03:24.340
the transformative
breakthrough that we thought.

00:03:24.340 --> 00:03:28.180
The first stone tools appear
around 3.3 million years

00:03:28.180 --> 00:03:29.890
and then nothing happens.

00:03:29.890 --> 00:03:32.590
In fact, the graph should
probably look more like this.

00:03:32.590 --> 00:03:37.523
You have a little bit of a
flash, or a flash in the pan,

00:03:37.523 --> 00:03:39.720
let me get the laser pointer up here,

00:03:39.720 --> 00:03:43.150
at 3.3 million years ago,
then a whole lot of nothing,

00:03:43.150 --> 00:03:45.050
until about 2.6 when you have some

00:03:45.050 --> 00:03:47.210
low-intensity mucking about in toolmaking,

00:03:47.210 --> 00:03:49.010
but it doesn't really take off

00:03:49.010 --> 00:03:50.980
until after two million years.

00:03:50.980 --> 00:03:53.110
So maybe early stone tools really aren't

00:03:53.110 --> 00:03:55.560
that much of a big deal after all.

00:03:55.560 --> 00:03:57.310
But obviously I don't believe that.

00:03:58.760 --> 00:04:00.809
And in fact, you could say that

00:04:00.809 --> 00:04:05.809
the termite probe here is a
tool, the phone is a tool.

00:04:06.400 --> 00:04:08.480
You know, they're the
same thing qualitatively,

00:04:08.480 --> 00:04:10.550
but quantitatively there's a massive

00:04:10.550 --> 00:04:13.633
difference in complexity
that we need to explain.

00:04:17.432 --> 00:04:21.363
So take this famous scene from
Shibuya Crossing in Tokyo.

00:04:22.567 --> 00:04:25.970
Arguably there's not a single
natural thing in sight here.

00:04:25.970 --> 00:04:28.700
Even the people, even the bodies,

00:04:28.700 --> 00:04:30.650
the human bodies have been transformed

00:04:30.650 --> 00:04:33.990
by this long engagement with technology.

00:04:33.990 --> 00:04:36.570
The reduction in the size
of our jaws and teeth

00:04:36.570 --> 00:04:39.340
and our gut from external
processing of food,

00:04:39.340 --> 00:04:42.170
the adaptations to the hands and arm

00:04:42.170 --> 00:04:43.720
for dextrous manipulation, and of course,

00:04:43.720 --> 00:04:46.630
the very large energy-hungry brain.

00:04:46.630 --> 00:04:48.610
But the other thing to
notice in this picture

00:04:48.610 --> 00:04:51.440
is how many people there are.

00:04:51.440 --> 00:04:53.640
Despite this really expensive brain,

00:04:53.640 --> 00:04:55.080
the very long development,

00:04:55.080 --> 00:04:57.380
the heavy investment that children require

00:04:58.362 --> 00:04:59.503
that you may be familiar with,

00:05:00.490 --> 00:05:04.890
there's more than seven
billion of us on the planet.

00:05:04.890 --> 00:05:07.710
Compared to the other apes, human mothers

00:05:07.710 --> 00:05:09.990
have the shortest interbirth interval

00:05:09.990 --> 00:05:12.460
and the highest total fertility rate

00:05:12.460 --> 00:05:14.760
despite having these
really expensive offspring.

00:05:14.760 --> 00:05:17.100
So basically, they should not
be able to afford to do this.

00:05:17.100 --> 00:05:18.430
Human women should not be able to

00:05:18.430 --> 00:05:20.300
afford this rate of reproduction.

00:05:20.300 --> 00:05:21.740
So how they do it is they do

00:05:21.740 --> 00:05:24.820
receive assistance from others.

00:05:24.820 --> 00:05:26.750
This could be fathers, could be siblings,

00:05:26.750 --> 00:05:29.030
could be grandparents, other
members of the community,

00:05:29.030 --> 00:05:31.492
in a strategy that's been called

00:05:31.492 --> 00:05:34.150
a human biocultural reproductive strategy.

00:05:34.150 --> 00:05:35.970
But obviously, for these other individuals

00:05:35.970 --> 00:05:39.600
to provide assistance to human mothers,

00:05:39.600 --> 00:05:41.750
they have to produce more than

00:05:41.750 --> 00:05:44.490
just what they themselves need to survive.

00:05:44.490 --> 00:05:47.249
And throughout the life
course, chimpanzees pretty much

00:05:47.249 --> 00:05:49.900
produce what they consume and
consume what they produce.

00:05:49.900 --> 00:05:51.360
Except for maybe a little bit of nursing

00:05:51.360 --> 00:05:54.060
right here at the outset,
it tracks closely.

00:05:54.060 --> 00:05:58.210
Now humans, we have this
long, very expensive childhood

00:05:58.210 --> 00:06:01.700
in which we are producing much
less than we're consuming.

00:06:01.700 --> 00:06:05.860
But eventually, we're able
to start producing a surplus,

00:06:05.860 --> 00:06:09.470
and the reason for this
is what I call technology,

00:06:09.470 --> 00:06:13.030
these culturally inherited,
passed-on techniques

00:06:13.030 --> 00:06:15.410
for exploiting the environment.

00:06:15.410 --> 00:06:19.680
So this describes a human
technological niche.

00:06:19.680 --> 00:06:21.530
What you've got here is a powerful

00:06:21.530 --> 00:06:23.589
biocultural feedback cycle where

00:06:23.589 --> 00:06:27.660
technology can increase production,

00:06:27.660 --> 00:06:29.860
which provides the resources for sharing

00:06:29.860 --> 00:06:32.610
which can subsidize long expensive

00:06:32.610 --> 00:06:34.780
development in population growth,

00:06:34.780 --> 00:06:36.640
which makes it possible to grow

00:06:36.640 --> 00:06:38.350
and educate a large brain,

00:06:38.350 --> 00:06:39.450
which makes it possible to have

00:06:39.450 --> 00:06:42.680
further technological
innovations, and so forth.

00:06:42.680 --> 00:06:44.700
Now, as I articulated there,

00:06:44.700 --> 00:06:48.170
this suggests a very
powerful, as I said, feedback,

00:06:48.170 --> 00:06:49.840
or even a runaway feedback curve,

00:06:49.840 --> 00:06:52.270
so maybe we're back to the, you know,

00:06:52.270 --> 00:06:54.350
guy tossing a bone in the air, after all.

00:06:54.350 --> 00:06:56.480
Once it gets started how do you stop it?

00:06:56.480 --> 00:06:59.090
But in fact, not every
technological innovation

00:06:59.090 --> 00:07:01.130
is necessarily gonna be a gamechanger

00:07:01.130 --> 00:07:04.060
that is going to increase your production.

00:07:04.060 --> 00:07:05.910
Increase in intelligence may lead

00:07:05.910 --> 00:07:08.860
to greater refinement of toolmaking

00:07:08.860 --> 00:07:10.780
rather than some kind of innovation.

00:07:10.780 --> 00:07:12.970
And so, models that take the interaction

00:07:12.970 --> 00:07:15.260
between some of these
variables into account,

00:07:15.260 --> 00:07:17.120
well they can produce
this exponential curve,

00:07:17.120 --> 00:07:19.120
but they can also produce a series

00:07:19.120 --> 00:07:21.320
of steps and plateaus
that's a lot more like

00:07:21.320 --> 00:07:23.823
what the archeological
record actually looks like.

00:07:24.760 --> 00:07:26.680
So unfortunately things are complicated.

00:07:26.680 --> 00:07:28.540
Life is complicated, and we have to turn

00:07:28.540 --> 00:07:30.320
to the actual archeological record

00:07:30.320 --> 00:07:34.100
and try to figure out what
happened, when, where, and why.

00:07:34.100 --> 00:07:37.160
So why didn't the earliest
stone tools take off?

00:07:37.160 --> 00:07:39.103
Why wasn't this a gamechanger?

00:07:40.160 --> 00:07:44.490
So, if you've ever loosened or tightened

00:07:44.490 --> 00:07:46.320
a screw using the knife you happen

00:07:46.320 --> 00:07:47.700
to have in your hand rather than

00:07:47.700 --> 00:07:49.690
digging through your tool chest

00:07:49.690 --> 00:07:51.480
to get a proper screwdriver,

00:07:51.480 --> 00:07:53.960
or if you've weighed
the costs and benefits

00:07:53.960 --> 00:07:55.978
of updating your operating system,

00:07:55.978 --> 00:08:00.720
you know that technology comes
with both costs and benefits.

00:08:00.720 --> 00:08:03.965
So for instance, you know,
technology might increase

00:08:03.965 --> 00:08:07.470
your rate of return, but before
you can start employing it

00:08:07.470 --> 00:08:09.070
you may have to gather raw materials,

00:08:09.070 --> 00:08:11.870
you may have to actually
produce and maintain the tools,

00:08:11.870 --> 00:08:13.190
and critically, you've gotta learn

00:08:13.190 --> 00:08:14.910
how to do all of these
things before you can

00:08:14.910 --> 00:08:18.110
even start harvesting
form the environment.

00:08:18.110 --> 00:08:19.910
And in some circumstances
you'd be better off

00:08:19.910 --> 00:08:22.080
to just start right in
with a simpler technology

00:08:22.080 --> 00:08:24.150
rather than wasting all of this time.

00:08:24.150 --> 00:08:27.580
I'm going to focus, well
actually the argument here,

00:08:27.580 --> 00:08:29.210
to make it explicit, is that this could

00:08:29.210 --> 00:08:31.370
help to explain some of the patterning

00:08:31.370 --> 00:08:33.769
that we see in the archeological record.

00:08:33.769 --> 00:08:36.333
I'm going to focus in
particular on skill learning,

00:08:36.333 --> 00:08:38.250
the cost of skill learning,

00:08:38.250 --> 00:08:40.270
because this is something
that, evolutionarily,

00:08:40.270 --> 00:08:42.810
brain evolution could mitigate the costs

00:08:42.810 --> 00:08:45.943
of skill evolution, of
skill learning, I'm sorry,

00:08:47.341 --> 00:08:49.330
and also changes in our donation

00:08:49.330 --> 00:08:51.150
of time and energy in
the form of teaching.

00:08:51.150 --> 00:08:53.190
So sharing our time and
energy to teach others

00:08:53.190 --> 00:08:56.530
could alter the costs and benefits

00:08:56.530 --> 00:08:58.813
of investment in skill learning.

00:08:59.730 --> 00:09:04.730
So chimpanzees, apes, can make stone tools

00:09:05.240 --> 00:09:06.892
But they don't do it in the wild.

00:09:06.892 --> 00:09:10.317
And in fact, it takes
them a really long time

00:09:10.317 --> 00:09:12.830
to learn how to do it and how to make

00:09:12.830 --> 00:09:14.963
tools that are, frankly, not very good.

00:09:15.810 --> 00:09:18.730
So it's really no wonder that
they don't bother to do this.

00:09:18.730 --> 00:09:20.170
Now part of the reason,

00:09:20.170 --> 00:09:21.860
and Dr. Fragaszy talked
about some of this,

00:09:21.860 --> 00:09:24.030
part of the reason probably
has to do with their hands.

00:09:24.030 --> 00:09:26.330
So they have these very long fingers

00:09:26.330 --> 00:09:29.060
that make some of the
manipulations of stones

00:09:29.060 --> 00:09:31.510
that we do for stone toolmaking difficult.

00:09:31.510 --> 00:09:34.652
But I think that there's more
to it than just the hands.

00:09:34.652 --> 00:09:39.609
So for reference, here
is a skilled modern human

00:09:39.609 --> 00:09:43.050
making simple stone flakes.

00:09:43.050 --> 00:09:45.610
These sharp pieces of
rock that are coming off

00:09:45.610 --> 00:09:48.320
are surprisingly effective
knives, actually,

00:09:48.320 --> 00:09:51.250
you can use them to butcher
a wide range of animals.

00:09:51.250 --> 00:09:53.160
And what's required here is to identify

00:09:53.160 --> 00:09:55.817
the appropriate geometry on the stone,

00:09:55.817 --> 00:09:58.950
to very dexterously
manipulate and support it

00:09:58.950 --> 00:10:01.230
with the left hand while delivering

00:10:01.230 --> 00:10:05.440
very forceful and accurate
strikes with the right hand.

00:10:05.440 --> 00:10:07.240
Now this is not rocket science,

00:10:07.240 --> 00:10:09.110
but it does require some pretty

00:10:09.110 --> 00:10:11.164
sophisticated spatial relationships

00:10:11.164 --> 00:10:16.164
as well as some highly skilled
manual movements and control.

00:10:17.700 --> 00:10:19.570
So I don't think it's just the fingers,

00:10:19.570 --> 00:10:22.880
but I think it's also the
brain that's involved here

00:10:22.880 --> 00:10:24.370
that makes this easier for humans

00:10:24.370 --> 00:10:26.920
than it is for chimpanzees.

00:10:26.920 --> 00:10:30.100
And in fact, humans have
an expanded neural system,

00:10:30.100 --> 00:10:32.270
a dorsal stream, for relating things

00:10:32.270 --> 00:10:35.240
like spatial relations, body positions,

00:10:35.240 --> 00:10:37.450
object identification and kinematics

00:10:37.450 --> 00:10:40.070
to technological goals,

00:10:40.070 --> 00:10:42.510
that I think makes it
easier and less costly

00:10:42.510 --> 00:10:45.800
for humans to learn these kinds of skills.

00:10:45.800 --> 00:10:47.421
And in fact, this is exactly,

00:10:47.421 --> 00:10:49.373
and if you do a functional imaging

00:10:49.373 --> 00:10:51.870
of the systems that are activated

00:10:51.870 --> 00:10:53.730
during simple stone toolmaking,

00:10:53.730 --> 00:10:55.945
this is the same network of structures

00:10:55.945 --> 00:10:59.490
that you see involved there.

00:10:59.490 --> 00:11:02.794
So, if we turn to Australopithecines,

00:11:02.794 --> 00:11:07.390
with their small brains,
with large jaws and teeth

00:11:07.390 --> 00:11:12.390
and guts adapted for digesting
unprocessed kinds of foods,

00:11:13.260 --> 00:11:14.480
with hands and arms that may or

00:11:14.480 --> 00:11:16.110
may not have been up to the task,

00:11:16.110 --> 00:11:18.240
it's probably the case
that stone toolmaking

00:11:18.240 --> 00:11:21.380
just wasn't really worth it
for them as an investment.

00:11:21.380 --> 00:11:23.692
The exception, then, that
proves the rule here,

00:11:23.692 --> 00:11:26.290
is the Lomekwian stone toolmaking,

00:11:26.290 --> 00:11:27.850
which actually was produced using

00:11:27.850 --> 00:11:31.730
less demanding techniques
like indirect percussion

00:11:31.730 --> 00:11:34.509
against a rock, a
stationary rock like this,

00:11:34.509 --> 00:11:37.550
or bipolar shattering on an anvil.

00:11:37.550 --> 00:11:40.770
And you can see that the experimenter here

00:11:40.770 --> 00:11:45.170
actually has their fingers bound together

00:11:45.170 --> 00:11:47.730
to make this point, it requires a lot less

00:11:47.730 --> 00:11:50.030
demanding kind of manipulation.

00:11:50.030 --> 00:11:52.900
So less investment in
skill, but perhaps also

00:11:52.900 --> 00:11:56.273
less payoff in terms of the
effectiveness of the technology.

00:11:57.920 --> 00:12:00.910
By 2.5, 2.6 million years ago,

00:12:00.910 --> 00:12:04.170
we do have evidence of
more skill-intensive,

00:12:04.170 --> 00:12:06.740
more dexterous freehand flaking,

00:12:06.740 --> 00:12:09.460
like what we saw in that video,

00:12:09.460 --> 00:12:13.061
from sites, the site of Gona in Ethiopa,

00:12:13.061 --> 00:12:16.021
where I worked with Dr. Sileshi Semaw.

00:12:16.021 --> 00:12:18.070
And you can see some of these tools

00:12:18.070 --> 00:12:20.300
are made very finely, very small.

00:12:20.300 --> 00:12:21.660
Some very delicate flaking

00:12:21.660 --> 00:12:23.870
and precise gestures involved there.

00:12:23.870 --> 00:12:26.953
And arguably could then be
a more efficient technology

00:12:26.953 --> 00:12:29.240
that might have a better payoff.

00:12:29.240 --> 00:12:32.110
We don't really know very
much about early Homo

00:12:32.110 --> 00:12:33.870
that was around at this time,

00:12:33.870 --> 00:12:36.100
except the teeth maybe
are a little bit smaller.

00:12:36.100 --> 00:12:38.788
We could speculate the brain's
also bigger, we don't know.

00:12:38.788 --> 00:12:42.050
Australopithecines also
around at the right

00:12:42.050 --> 00:12:43.710
time and place to make these tools

00:12:43.710 --> 00:12:46.900
don't show any obvious
adaptations for toolmaking.

00:12:46.900 --> 00:12:49.490
And the sites on the landscape

00:12:49.490 --> 00:12:51.800
remain rare and somewhat ephemeral.

00:12:51.800 --> 00:12:54.410
So this is maybe sometimes worth it.

00:12:54.410 --> 00:12:56.810
And it's only after about
two million years ago

00:12:56.810 --> 00:12:57.780
that we see what I'm going to

00:12:57.780 --> 00:13:01.180
loosely call habitual toolmaking,

00:13:01.180 --> 00:13:04.597
though I think John Shay,
who we'll hear from,

00:13:04.597 --> 00:13:07.630
has a different definition of habitual.

00:13:07.630 --> 00:13:09.100
But I just mean, in the sense that they're

00:13:09.100 --> 00:13:11.590
doing it much more frequently,
the sites are larger,

00:13:11.590 --> 00:13:14.090
they are denser, they occur across

00:13:14.090 --> 00:13:16.550
more of the continent, it persists.

00:13:16.550 --> 00:13:19.493
And this is interesting
because there's a, you know,

00:13:19.493 --> 00:13:21.870
a pretty loose, we like to
do these correspondences,

00:13:21.870 --> 00:13:23.717
between this shift in the technology

00:13:23.717 --> 00:13:25.080
and the appearance of evidence

00:13:25.080 --> 00:13:27.160
of larger brain and body size.

00:13:27.160 --> 00:13:29.750
And it's pretty rapidly after that,

00:13:29.750 --> 00:13:32.403
by 1.8, 1.7 million years ago,

00:13:32.403 --> 00:13:35.163
that we see the invention of
an entirely new technology,

00:13:35.163 --> 00:13:37.200
what we call the Early Acheulean,

00:13:37.200 --> 00:13:39.379
where for the first time
tools are being made

00:13:39.379 --> 00:13:42.760
to an intentional shape, imposing a point,

00:13:42.760 --> 00:13:45.500
these things we call picks and hand axes,

00:13:45.500 --> 00:13:47.400
which are often made by striking

00:13:47.400 --> 00:13:50.010
a really large flake
off of a boulder core,

00:13:50.010 --> 00:13:51.660
which requires a whole different technique

00:13:51.660 --> 00:13:53.400
and different kind of manual skill

00:13:53.400 --> 00:13:54.979
and seems to go hand in hand

00:13:54.979 --> 00:13:59.280
with the appearance of Homo
erectus in the loose sense,

00:13:59.280 --> 00:14:02.133
with larger brains and body size.

00:14:03.390 --> 00:14:07.347
This, then, appears to be
a fairly stable adaptation.

00:14:07.347 --> 00:14:11.010
With or without hand ax, hominids are able

00:14:11.010 --> 00:14:15.500
to inhabit diverse environments
throughout Eurasia,

00:14:15.500 --> 00:14:19.310
even up to the edge of
the Boreal zone here.

00:14:19.310 --> 00:14:22.740
And in places where hand
axes were made consistently

00:14:22.740 --> 00:14:24.940
throughout this period,
like in East Africa,

00:14:24.940 --> 00:14:27.880
there is some evidence of
incremental refinement,

00:14:27.880 --> 00:14:30.060
but overall things seem
to be pretty stable,

00:14:30.060 --> 00:14:32.080
if variable, stable but variable

00:14:32.080 --> 00:14:34.981
for about a million years or more.

00:14:34.981 --> 00:14:37.990
And it's by then about
half-a-million years ago

00:14:37.990 --> 00:14:39.450
that we see clear evidence that we've

00:14:39.450 --> 00:14:42.628
entered into another
period of abrupt change

00:14:42.628 --> 00:14:46.516
indicated by rapid encephalization,

00:14:46.516 --> 00:14:49.160
by the expansion into new habitats,

00:14:49.160 --> 00:14:52.950
and by the appearance of new
forms of technology as well.

00:14:52.950 --> 00:14:54.860
And one of these that I've studied

00:14:54.860 --> 00:14:59.860
in some detail are Late
Acheulean style hand axes,

00:15:00.420 --> 00:15:03.379
like this one from Boxgrove in the UK.

00:15:03.379 --> 00:15:06.467
And, in contrast to earlier tools,

00:15:06.467 --> 00:15:11.320
earlier hand axes, these
are very nicely shaped,

00:15:11.320 --> 00:15:16.320
and especially, made very flat
and thin in cross section.

00:15:17.060 --> 00:15:18.610
And I emphasize that because that's

00:15:18.610 --> 00:15:21.610
actually a very difficult
thing to achieve with a rock,

00:15:21.610 --> 00:15:23.540
by hitting it with another rock.

00:15:23.540 --> 00:15:26.890
You start off with a big
nodule, irregularly shaped,

00:15:26.890 --> 00:15:28.600
and you have to flatten that thing down.

00:15:28.600 --> 00:15:30.800
And the only way you're
going to be able to do that

00:15:30.800 --> 00:15:32.840
is if you can strike flakes that travel

00:15:32.840 --> 00:15:36.150
more than halfway across
the surface of the rock.

00:15:36.150 --> 00:15:39.410
And to enable that kind of fracture,

00:15:39.410 --> 00:15:40.490
you really need to be able

00:15:40.490 --> 00:15:42.640
to delicately adjust the angle,

00:15:42.640 --> 00:15:44.000
the placement in the bevel,

00:15:44.000 --> 00:15:46.200
of the edge relative to the midline,

00:15:46.200 --> 00:15:47.910
in order to ensure that the flaky strike

00:15:47.910 --> 00:15:49.779
is going to actually travel

00:15:49.779 --> 00:15:51.580
some distance along the core face.

00:15:51.580 --> 00:15:54.860
Archeologists call this
striking platform preparation.

00:15:54.860 --> 00:15:57.960
And this entire technology
is a very demanding one.

00:15:57.960 --> 00:16:00.369
So, in order to find out
a little bit more about

00:16:00.369 --> 00:16:03.343
exactly what goes into
learning how to do this,

00:16:03.343 --> 00:16:07.500
we recently ran an experiment
training modern people

00:16:07.500 --> 00:16:10.610
to make these kinds of stone
tools, about 20 people.

00:16:10.610 --> 00:16:13.270
They received close to
100 hours of training,

00:16:13.270 --> 00:16:17.410
each from an expert stone
toolmaker, Dr. Nada Khreisheh.

00:16:17.410 --> 00:16:20.380
Their products, and
we've collected all kinds

00:16:20.380 --> 00:16:22.510
of information about these
people and their behavior,

00:16:22.510 --> 00:16:24.210
their lithic products I'll talk about,

00:16:24.210 --> 00:16:25.660
the actual tools they made,

00:16:25.660 --> 00:16:28.653
have been analyzed by Dr. Justin Pargeter

00:16:28.653 --> 00:16:31.520
in my lab as well, he's
my current postdoc.

00:16:31.520 --> 00:16:36.520
And what we found is a
classic power learning curve,

00:16:38.590 --> 00:16:41.848
in which early progress is rapid,

00:16:41.848 --> 00:16:44.510
but then it asymptotes off to pretty much

00:16:44.510 --> 00:16:47.230
a plateau of diminishing
returns from practice.

00:16:47.230 --> 00:16:49.500
You may be familiar
with this kind of effect

00:16:49.500 --> 00:16:51.160
in sports or anything like that.

00:16:51.160 --> 00:16:54.529
It's found across a wide
range of different skills.

00:16:54.529 --> 00:16:58.310
Things being as they are in life,

00:16:58.310 --> 00:17:00.890
although we tried to
control training time,

00:17:00.890 --> 00:17:02.700
there was some variability in how often

00:17:02.700 --> 00:17:04.656
people were able to make it

00:17:04.656 --> 00:17:05.770
into the lab for training sessions,

00:17:05.770 --> 00:17:07.960
and we found that not only is it

00:17:07.960 --> 00:17:10.210
the total amount of practice
that you've racked up,

00:17:10.210 --> 00:17:12.750
but it's actually the
density, the frequency

00:17:12.750 --> 00:17:14.510
and intensity of your practice,

00:17:14.510 --> 00:17:15.960
that helps to determine individual

00:17:15.960 --> 00:17:18.260
differences in the
progress of skill learning.

00:17:19.140 --> 00:17:21.920
I wanna point out here that this scale

00:17:21.920 --> 00:17:23.450
is actually a five point scale,

00:17:23.450 --> 00:17:25.540
so the top is not even
being shown on the graph

00:17:25.540 --> 00:17:29.030
because nobody even got
close to it in 90 hours.

00:17:29.030 --> 00:17:31.860
We could extrapolate, from
individual learning curves,

00:17:31.860 --> 00:17:33.580
the people in our study, we expect,

00:17:33.580 --> 00:17:35.790
would've taken anywhere from 121 hours

00:17:35.790 --> 00:17:38.127
to over 400 hours to achieve mastery

00:17:38.127 --> 00:17:41.240
comparable to what we see at Boxgrove

00:17:41.240 --> 00:17:42.830
in this kind of toolmaking.

00:17:42.830 --> 00:17:47.280
This is a very substantial
investment of time,

00:17:47.280 --> 00:17:48.480
especially considering that we've

00:17:48.480 --> 00:17:49.430
given these people everything.

00:17:49.430 --> 00:17:51.595
They don't have to gather their tools,

00:17:51.595 --> 00:17:52.671
don't have to make their equipment,

00:17:52.671 --> 00:17:53.763
it's all right there for them.

00:17:53.763 --> 00:17:55.259
And we're still talking several

00:17:55.259 --> 00:17:56.650
hundred hours of dedicated practice.

00:17:56.650 --> 00:17:58.940
And this, to us, begins to suggest

00:18:00.200 --> 00:18:02.610
that we may be starting to see

00:18:02.610 --> 00:18:04.838
some of the kinds of
support that modern humans

00:18:04.838 --> 00:18:09.330
provide for the transmission
of complex technical skills,

00:18:09.330 --> 00:18:12.060
everything ranging from
intentional demonstration,

00:18:12.060 --> 00:18:15.410
perhaps explicit teaching,
certainly social support,

00:18:15.410 --> 00:18:18.088
coaching, scaffolding, and encouragement.

00:18:18.088 --> 00:18:20.990
So the social context
is a very important part

00:18:20.990 --> 00:18:23.540
of what's evolving here in
the technological niche.

00:18:24.420 --> 00:18:25.950
The other thing, of
course, is that learning

00:18:25.950 --> 00:18:29.660
complex skills does
require complex cognition,

00:18:29.660 --> 00:18:32.900
and during this initial
jump in performance here,

00:18:32.900 --> 00:18:34.500
we found that individual differences

00:18:34.500 --> 00:18:37.360
in how rapidly you
kinda learned this skill

00:18:37.360 --> 00:18:38.690
were related to your performance

00:18:38.690 --> 00:18:43.217
on a classic neuropsychological
test of set shifting.

00:18:45.100 --> 00:18:47.680
Basically, you have to match
this card to one of these,

00:18:47.680 --> 00:18:50.449
you can match either on
shape or color or number,

00:18:50.449 --> 00:18:53.870
and your ability to do that,
they keep changing the rules,

00:18:53.870 --> 00:18:55.860
your ability to recognize
when a rule has changed

00:18:55.860 --> 00:18:57.510
is your set shifting ability.

00:18:57.510 --> 00:19:00.410
And if you temporarily mess
with the part of the brain

00:19:00.410 --> 00:19:02.500
that controls this, in the
right inferior frontal gyrus,

00:19:02.500 --> 00:19:04.930
with a magnetic pulse,
it slows people down

00:19:04.930 --> 00:19:07.670
in being able to put together
complex action sequences.

00:19:07.670 --> 00:19:10.170
Not coincidentally, this
very same part of the brain

00:19:10.170 --> 00:19:12.280
is what we consistently find to be active

00:19:12.280 --> 00:19:15.961
in functional imaging studies
of people making stone tools.

00:19:15.961 --> 00:19:18.170
It also experiences changes

00:19:18.170 --> 00:19:20.780
in white matter connectivity
during training.

00:19:20.780 --> 00:19:24.380
In fact, these changes are paralleled

00:19:24.380 --> 00:19:28.610
by species differences between
humans and chimpanzees,

00:19:28.610 --> 00:19:30.490
and particularly this right hemisphere

00:19:30.490 --> 00:19:31.860
inferior frontal gyrus.

00:19:31.860 --> 00:19:33.950
So we can say that evolutionary changes

00:19:33.950 --> 00:19:36.940
to this system in humans parallel

00:19:36.940 --> 00:19:38.690
the effects of toolmaking training.

00:19:38.690 --> 00:19:40.380
The remaining question is, you know,

00:19:40.380 --> 00:19:43.590
whether this is genetic
adaptation to toolmaking ability,

00:19:43.590 --> 00:19:45.830
or whether it's the developmental context

00:19:45.830 --> 00:19:47.730
of growing up in a technological niche,

00:19:47.730 --> 00:19:49.590
or some combination of those two,

00:19:49.590 --> 00:19:52.290
which is obviously the most likely thing.

00:19:52.290 --> 00:19:53.890
Anyway, it's going to be complicated,

00:19:53.890 --> 00:19:58.140
but hopefully, by continued study

00:19:58.140 --> 00:20:00.735
of the archeological record
and focused experimentation,

00:20:00.735 --> 00:20:03.562
we can begin to sort out
some of these details

00:20:03.562 --> 00:20:07.480
of the very extended
and multistage process

00:20:07.480 --> 00:20:10.770
through which the modern human
technological niche evolved.

00:20:10.770 --> 00:20:11.603
Thank you.
