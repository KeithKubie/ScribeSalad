00:00:00.580 --> 00:00:04.220
ALEX BELLOS: Well, I wrote a
whole chapter in my book,

00:00:04.220 --> 00:00:07.850
Alex's Adventures in Numberland,
about pi, because

00:00:07.850 --> 00:00:10.470
it's kind of the most famous
number in math.

00:00:10.470 --> 00:00:11.900
It's the sort of celebrity
number.

00:00:15.370 --> 00:00:19.970
Pi is the simplest possible
ratio of the

00:00:19.970 --> 00:00:21.580
simplest possible shape.

00:00:21.580 --> 00:00:25.820
So, the simplest possible shape
being a circle, really.

00:00:25.820 --> 00:00:29.890
And pi is the ratio of all the
way around it to all the way

00:00:29.890 --> 00:00:30.555
across it--

00:00:30.555 --> 00:00:33.000
its circumference
to its diameter.

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:34.760
ROGER BOWLEY: And the
Babylonians first thought it

00:00:34.760 --> 00:00:35.580
was about three.

00:00:35.580 --> 00:00:38.170
In fact, they wrote
it down as three.

00:00:38.170 --> 00:00:40.230
ALEX BELLOS: What is interesting
is that it's the

00:00:40.230 --> 00:00:45.380
simplest possible ratio of the
simplest possible shape, but

00:00:45.380 --> 00:00:49.920
it's the most complicated,
kind of ugly, number.

00:00:49.920 --> 00:00:52.370
It doesn't slice neatly.

00:00:52.370 --> 00:00:55.030
It's what's called an irrational
number, which means

00:00:55.030 --> 00:00:58.060
that if you were express it as
a decimal, the decimals just

00:00:58.060 --> 00:01:00.240
go on forever without
ever repeating.

00:01:00.240 --> 00:01:03.080
And people have been fascinated
by this idea that

00:01:03.080 --> 00:01:08.960
something so simple, something
so basic, it sort of lets you

00:01:08.960 --> 00:01:13.280
into this mess and madness
and chaos.

00:01:13.280 --> 00:01:15.890
ROGER BOWLEY: So I would like,
with your permission, to talk

00:01:15.890 --> 00:01:20.580
about the work that was done by
Archimedes which has been

00:01:20.580 --> 00:01:21.510
discovered.

00:01:21.510 --> 00:01:23.720
And he did it in the
following way.

00:01:23.720 --> 00:01:26.110
ALEX BELLOS: And so this was
this brilliant kind of

00:01:26.110 --> 00:01:28.670
narrative of human expedition.

00:01:28.670 --> 00:01:31.320
Like kind of trying to get to
the moon and then to get to

00:01:31.320 --> 00:01:34.490
the next planet, of trying to
find more and more digits.

00:01:34.490 --> 00:01:36.070
ROGER BOWLEY: He took
a unit circle--

00:01:36.070 --> 00:01:38.910
so I'm going to make a unit
circle on here, and draw it

00:01:38.910 --> 00:01:44.640
out in green, so that you can
see, that's a simple circle.

00:01:44.640 --> 00:01:45.850
MALE SPEAKER 1: Lovely
circle, Roger.

00:01:45.850 --> 00:01:47.240
ROGER BOWLEY: I know,
I couldn't have

00:01:47.240 --> 00:01:48.760
drawn it better freehand.

00:01:48.760 --> 00:01:51.990
ALEX BELLOS: Also, it was one
of the first numbers to gain

00:01:51.990 --> 00:01:53.010
its own symbol.

00:01:53.010 --> 00:01:56.680
Because you can't keep writing
3.1415 all the time.

00:01:56.680 --> 00:02:01.720
And once it gained the pi,
probably short for periphery,

00:02:01.720 --> 00:02:05.120
the symbol, it just became
quite iconic.

00:02:05.120 --> 00:02:08.620
ROGER BOWLEY: Now I'm going to
draw inside, a triangle.

00:02:08.620 --> 00:02:11.039
And I'll try and make this
have equal sides.

00:02:11.039 --> 00:02:13.510
So we call it an equilateral
triangle.

00:02:13.510 --> 00:02:16.810
ALEX BELLOS: So just say you
were an ancient Egyptian wheel

00:02:16.810 --> 00:02:18.380
maker or something.

00:02:18.380 --> 00:02:19.980
Pi is going to come up, because
you're going to need

00:02:19.980 --> 00:02:24.377
to be calculating the size
of rims and spokes,

00:02:24.377 --> 00:02:25.600
and things like that.

00:02:25.600 --> 00:02:28.330
ROGER BOWLEY: Now if I were to
walk around this path, all the

00:02:28.330 --> 00:02:32.340
way, all the way around, that
is a longer path for me to

00:02:32.340 --> 00:02:35.630
walk than the path that goes
in a straight line between

00:02:35.630 --> 00:02:37.710
these points, between
these points, and

00:02:37.710 --> 00:02:38.770
between these points.

00:02:38.770 --> 00:02:42.010
So you can see this perimeter
is bigger than that.

00:02:42.010 --> 00:02:44.920
So then he went to the next
stage and put another little

00:02:44.920 --> 00:02:50.740
triangle in here, another one
there, and another one there.

00:02:50.740 --> 00:02:54.660
And you get a hexagon, that just
means six equal sides.

00:02:54.660 --> 00:02:59.060
And this is getting closer in
length to this perimeter.

00:02:59.060 --> 00:03:01.730
And then he went to the
next stage, to make

00:03:01.730 --> 00:03:03.550
something with 12 sides.

00:03:03.550 --> 00:03:06.250
So you end up with a
12 sided figure.

00:03:06.250 --> 00:03:11.940
Then he did 24, then he did
48, then he did 96.

00:03:11.940 --> 00:03:15.560
And this length is still less
than the radius of the circle,

00:03:15.560 --> 00:03:17.870
because when you go in a
straight line, it's quicker

00:03:17.870 --> 00:03:19.800
than going on a curved line.

00:03:19.800 --> 00:03:23.900
And he got out pi, which is--

00:03:23.900 --> 00:03:28.040
the circumference is 2
pi times the radius--

00:03:28.040 --> 00:03:35.990
this pi he gets out is
3 plus 10 over 71.

00:03:35.990 --> 00:03:37.440
That's a bound.

00:03:37.440 --> 00:03:40.570
Pi has got to be greater than
this because this curved

00:03:40.570 --> 00:03:42.890
surface is greater
than this number.

00:03:42.890 --> 00:03:47.070
When you have a 96-sided
regular figure.

00:03:47.070 --> 00:03:50.130
So, that wasn't the end of the
story because that doesn't

00:03:50.130 --> 00:03:51.270
give you the answer.

00:03:51.270 --> 00:03:57.420
He then considered a triangle
that goes outside with three

00:03:57.420 --> 00:03:59.170
equal sides.

00:03:59.170 --> 00:04:02.480
Now clearly, this
is much longer.

00:04:02.480 --> 00:04:06.240
You go much further than
going along this path.

00:04:06.240 --> 00:04:09.730
So this is going to give a
greater bound than pi.

00:04:09.730 --> 00:04:14.160
And then he filled it in with
lines and with lines.

00:04:14.160 --> 00:04:17.970
And now you've got a hexagon
that goes around this circle.

00:04:17.970 --> 00:04:21.140
And then he filled it in with
more, and he carried on like

00:04:21.140 --> 00:04:22.940
this 'til the cows come home.

00:04:22.940 --> 00:04:27.680
He went all way up to 96-sided
figures again, and that gave

00:04:27.680 --> 00:04:33.220
him the other bound, which
is, pi is less than 3

00:04:33.220 --> 00:04:36.140
plus 10 over 70.

00:04:36.140 --> 00:04:38.970
ALEX BELLOS: And using that
method, Archimedes sort of

00:04:38.970 --> 00:04:41.030
upped the ante, and
got much closer.

00:04:41.030 --> 00:04:46.840
And that was for, I think, 1,000
years, was basically how

00:04:46.840 --> 00:04:48.300
people estimated pi.

00:04:48.300 --> 00:04:50.340
ROGER BOWLEY: And so he got
two limits for this, and

00:04:50.340 --> 00:04:55.680
worked out from that, that
pi is about 3.1412.

00:04:55.680 --> 00:04:59.340
ALEX BELLOS: The next great jump
in understanding how to

00:04:59.340 --> 00:05:06.830
calculate pi required the era
in the Enlightenment and the

00:05:06.830 --> 00:05:08.430
invention of calculus.

00:05:08.430 --> 00:05:10.510
So even slightly pre-calculus,
the idea of

00:05:10.510 --> 00:05:12.670
the infinite series.

00:05:12.670 --> 00:05:18.690
The simplest infinite series for
pi is pi over 4 is equal

00:05:18.690 --> 00:05:26.430
to 1 minus 1/3 plus 1/5 minus
1/7, plus 1/9, et cetera, et

00:05:26.430 --> 00:05:27.380
cetera, et cetera.

00:05:27.380 --> 00:05:32.150
So, what you need to do is you
just need to add as many of

00:05:32.150 --> 00:05:34.270
the terms on as possible--

00:05:34.270 --> 00:05:37.480
which is kind of zigzagging
and still honing in on pi.

00:05:37.480 --> 00:05:40.770
And the more you do, the
closer you'll get pi.

00:05:40.770 --> 00:05:43.260
ROGER BOWLEY: People do it
on computers and get into

00:05:43.260 --> 00:05:45.520
hundreds of places of
decimals or more.

00:05:45.520 --> 00:05:48.200
I have no idea how accurately.

00:05:48.200 --> 00:05:50.400
This is the realm of
the super geek.

00:05:50.400 --> 00:05:52.340
ALEX BELLOS: The better
the computers got, the

00:05:52.340 --> 00:05:53.140
more digits they want.

00:05:53.140 --> 00:05:59.070
And now, I think 3 or 7 trillion
digits in pi has been

00:05:59.070 --> 00:06:00.390
the last ones decided.

00:06:00.390 --> 00:06:03.760
Remembering the digits in pi
is just as difficult--

00:06:03.760 --> 00:06:04.690
just as easy--

00:06:04.690 --> 00:06:06.680
just exactly the same-- as the
digits in the square root of

00:06:06.680 --> 00:06:13.150
2, the square root of 3, phi,
E, but no one wants to

00:06:13.150 --> 00:06:13.980
memorize those ones.

00:06:13.980 --> 00:06:15.340
They want to memorize pi.

00:06:15.340 --> 00:06:17.533
MALE SPEAKER 2: I wouldn't be
doing my job properly if I

00:06:17.533 --> 00:06:19.920
didn't ask you how many digits
you can remember pi to.

00:06:19.920 --> 00:06:22.030
ALEX BELLOS: Five.

00:06:22.030 --> 00:06:23.805
3.1459.

00:06:23.805 --> 00:06:26.270
Maybe there's a two
after that?

00:06:26.270 --> 00:06:29.990
Yeah, my memory is not--

00:06:29.990 --> 00:06:32.800
I don't like to spend my spare
time memorizing pi.

00:06:32.800 --> 00:06:36.490
ROGER BOWLEY: I got 3.14159.

00:06:36.490 --> 00:06:38.150
And I've got a mnemonic.

00:06:38.150 --> 00:06:40.280
ALEX BELLOS: The beauty of pi
is fascinating, but just

00:06:40.280 --> 00:06:42.920
memorizing things
is not my bag.

00:06:42.920 --> 00:06:46.790
ROGER BOWLEY: "How I Like To
Drink, Alcoholic Of Course,

00:06:46.790 --> 00:06:50.480
After Two Heavy Lectures
Involving Quantum Mechanics."

00:06:50.480 --> 00:06:53.510
ALEX BELLOS: At first, people
were sort of disconcerted by

00:06:53.510 --> 00:06:55.580
the fact that pi--

00:06:55.580 --> 00:06:56.590
the numbers in pi--

00:06:56.590 --> 00:06:58.280
the digits never repeat

00:06:58.280 --> 00:07:00.940
ROGER BOWLEY: "How" has three
letters, "I" has one--

00:07:00.940 --> 00:07:02.330
3.1.

00:07:02.330 --> 00:07:03.570
"Like," four.

00:07:03.570 --> 00:07:04.660
"To"--

00:07:04.660 --> 00:07:06.000
3.142.

00:07:06.000 --> 00:07:07.470
"Drink," five.

00:07:07.470 --> 00:07:10.030
"Alcoholic," nine.

00:07:10.030 --> 00:07:13.730
ALEX BELLOS: But actually, this
fact they don't repeat is

00:07:13.730 --> 00:07:16.540
actually what's fascinating.

00:07:16.540 --> 00:07:17.980
ROGER BOWLEY: "Of," two.

00:07:17.980 --> 00:07:19.390
And then we're getting
where I don't know.

00:07:19.390 --> 00:07:23.190
2-6, "Course." "After," five.

00:07:23.190 --> 00:07:25.910
The Heavy, Lectures.

00:07:25.910 --> 00:07:27.090
ALEX BELLOS: The pattern.

00:07:27.090 --> 00:07:31.410
They're so devoid of any
pattern, that actually, the

00:07:31.410 --> 00:07:35.360
digits in pi, if taken as random
numbers, are the most

00:07:35.360 --> 00:07:38.150
random numbers that we
know of, really.

00:07:38.150 --> 00:07:40.260
They pass sort of
every test for

00:07:40.260 --> 00:07:43.440
randomness with flying colors.

00:07:43.440 --> 00:07:44.470
ROGER BOWLEY: "After," five.

00:07:44.470 --> 00:07:45.530
"The," three.

00:07:45.530 --> 00:07:46.580
"Heavy," five.

00:07:46.580 --> 00:07:49.610
"Lectures," I can't
count-- eight--

00:07:49.610 --> 00:07:51.690
Involving Quantum Mechanics.

00:07:51.690 --> 00:07:54.490
And you can get even longer
ones than these.

00:07:54.490 --> 00:07:57.290
These are ways of remembering
if you remember the phrase.

00:07:57.290 --> 00:07:58.930
But of course, I can't
remember the phrase.

00:07:58.930 --> 00:08:00.610
I prefer to remember
the number.

00:08:00.610 --> 00:08:05.300
ALEX BELLOS: What you had during
the 1970s and '80s was

00:08:05.300 --> 00:08:10.830
a sort of arms race between
America and Japan where the

00:08:10.830 --> 00:08:14.290
two great tech nations
developing their

00:08:14.290 --> 00:08:15.630
supercomputers.

00:08:15.630 --> 00:08:17.330
And really--

00:08:17.330 --> 00:08:20.780
no one really cares what digit
the two billionth digit in pi

00:08:20.780 --> 00:08:23.010
is, but you want to do it
because it shows how strong

00:08:23.010 --> 00:08:24.280
your computer is.

00:08:24.280 --> 00:08:27.080
They're not interested in the
digits in pi because it's

00:08:27.080 --> 00:08:29.080
going to be any use in
terms of doing any

00:08:29.080 --> 00:08:30.730
calculations with circles.

00:08:30.730 --> 00:08:35.780
Because just say, your
high-precision wheel design or

00:08:35.780 --> 00:08:36.570
something--

00:08:36.570 --> 00:08:40.260
or even if you do something
for like a spaceship--

00:08:40.260 --> 00:08:43.440
10, pi to 10 decimal
places, that's

00:08:43.440 --> 00:08:45.010
probably more than enough.

00:08:45.010 --> 00:08:47.430
You're just never going
to need that much.

00:08:47.430 --> 00:08:49.770
But now we have it to several
trillion decimal places.

00:08:49.770 --> 00:08:51.010
ROGER BOWLEY: To a physicist,
there's

00:08:51.010 --> 00:08:52.320
an engineering approach.

00:08:52.320 --> 00:08:54.390
That if you've got it on your
calculator to enough

00:08:54.390 --> 00:08:56.670
significant figures, you
really don't care.

00:08:56.670 --> 00:08:59.540
Because most of the time when
we're working in physics, you

00:08:59.540 --> 00:09:01.460
work to two or three significant
figures.

00:09:01.460 --> 00:09:02.820
ALEX BELLOS: It's good for
testing computers.

00:09:02.820 --> 00:09:06.790
And it's also fantastic
have this set of

00:09:06.790 --> 00:09:08.160
beautifully random numbers.
