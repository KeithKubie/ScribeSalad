1
00:00:00,290 --> 00:00:05,290
[inaudible] joining me today is an
Iranian born Shia Muslim scholar and the

2
00:00:07,981 --> 00:00:11,700
president of the Islamic
Association of South Australia.

3
00:00:11,990 --> 00:00:14,910
You mom Mohammed to Ed. Welcome
to the Rubin report. Hello.

4
00:00:15,160 --> 00:00:15,993
Thank you for having me.

5
00:00:16,320 --> 00:00:19,260
Which one of us is going to be in
more trouble for doing this? Well,

6
00:00:19,261 --> 00:00:23,910
I'm already in enough
trouble, so hopefully we can
share that part. All right,

7
00:00:23,911 --> 00:00:28,650
so two interesting things that happened
even before we start this conversation.

8
00:00:28,651 --> 00:00:32,400
First you said to me in the green room,
nothing is off limits.

9
00:00:32,430 --> 00:00:36,360
You said asked me the hardest questions
you can possibly do because, uh,

10
00:00:36,361 --> 00:00:39,930
I appreciate that as an interviewer and
that's, it's a refreshing thing to hear.

11
00:00:40,230 --> 00:00:44,310
Um, I just thought it was interesting
that you even said that to me because it's

12
00:00:44,311 --> 00:00:47,670
like, you know, a lot of times people just
want to come in and say what they want,

13
00:00:47,671 --> 00:00:51,540
but, but you, you want to be challenged.
You want to go to those places.

14
00:00:51,780 --> 00:00:52,613
I'm trying to,

15
00:00:53,280 --> 00:00:56,940
I've had so many interviews over 400
interviews in the last two years,

16
00:00:57,270 --> 00:01:00,720
whether they be on radio
or television or youtube.

17
00:01:01,110 --> 00:01:04,710
And I just feel that many people,
uh,

18
00:01:05,280 --> 00:01:09,180
give us special treatment just because
I'm Muslim and even though they know that

19
00:01:09,181 --> 00:01:12,100
I do have some conservative views such as,
uh,

20
00:01:12,190 --> 00:01:15,150
a border on border protection,
national security,

21
00:01:15,480 --> 00:01:18,510
but even then they still want to
give me that special treatment.

22
00:01:18,511 --> 00:01:22,110
So I made that request publicly as
well. Yeah. Okay. Please don't be nice.

23
00:01:22,170 --> 00:01:23,880
There's a lot of information
I could share. All right,

24
00:01:23,881 --> 00:01:25,200
well I'm probably going to be nice to you,

25
00:01:25,201 --> 00:01:27,900
but I will try to get to some of the
hard stuff. Don't worry. It's right here.

26
00:01:27,901 --> 00:01:30,660
That's number one. And then number
two, right before we started,

27
00:01:30,661 --> 00:01:34,260
you requested that normally
right behind you there we have a,

28
00:01:34,261 --> 00:01:37,470
a little bing of wine bottles
that are right behind you.

29
00:01:37,650 --> 00:01:40,980
And you asked that we removed it just out
of your direct shot behind you because

30
00:01:40,981 --> 00:01:45,450
you just don't want to get any, any
bonus hate, let's say, which I think is,

31
00:01:46,200 --> 00:01:47,760
I sympathize with that position.

32
00:01:47,761 --> 00:01:49,950
But it's also sort of interesting
because you take all of these very

33
00:01:49,951 --> 00:01:51,870
controversial positions and it's like,
oh,

34
00:01:51,871 --> 00:01:56,400
well they got him with some wine
bottles. It's like, yes, well these, uh,

35
00:01:56,460 --> 00:01:58,530
issues of the extremist agenda,

36
00:01:58,920 --> 00:02:03,920
extremist can obtain an image of me
beside the wine bottle or a bottle for

37
00:02:05,491 --> 00:02:06,001
example.

38
00:02:06,001 --> 00:02:10,050
Then they can easily discredit me as a
Muslim e mom because Muslims don't drink

39
00:02:10,051 --> 00:02:11,160
and I don't drink either.

40
00:02:11,370 --> 00:02:15,810
But they can easily stick that accusation
when they have a picture of me being

41
00:02:15,811 --> 00:02:19,890
close to a wine bottle and they want that
and I'm not going to allow them to do

42
00:02:19,891 --> 00:02:22,770
that. How thrilled are they going to
be that you're in the home studio?

43
00:02:22,770 --> 00:02:27,300
Have a gauge you, this cannot be a, a,
that's got to be worse than wine bottles.

44
00:02:27,360 --> 00:02:29,190
What's the list?
Well,

45
00:02:29,191 --> 00:02:32,460
I would say 2% upset
and they won't be happy.

46
00:02:32,461 --> 00:02:35,880
They won't be happy at the fact that,
uh, you have a large audience as well.

47
00:02:36,270 --> 00:02:39,720
So they try to silence me and you've
got people that tried to silence you as

48
00:02:39,721 --> 00:02:43,440
well. So, but I'm happy to be
here getting on not to do or not.

49
00:02:43,441 --> 00:02:47,010
I'm happy to be here. Yeah. And I'm happy
you're here and all right. So let's,

50
00:02:47,011 --> 00:02:50,020
let's let it fly. So first just tell me
a little bit about your history. You,

51
00:02:50,021 --> 00:02:54,150
you grew up in Iran until you were about
12 years old, right? Correct. Yeah, I was,

52
00:02:54,151 --> 00:02:56,530
uh, in Iran, uh,

53
00:02:57,000 --> 00:03:00,580
for the first 12 years of my life
and we traveled to Australia.

54
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:02,650
We'll ended in 1995.

55
00:03:03,290 --> 00:03:07,540
My father is a prominent
Muslim faith leader as well.

56
00:03:07,540 --> 00:03:11,170
And your mom and he traveled
from Melbourne, which we,

57
00:03:11,171 --> 00:03:15,700
we first landed to Western Australia
and established the first Shia Muslim

58
00:03:15,701 --> 00:03:18,820
mosque. And it was originally
a church. He called the,

59
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:23,710
it was called Saint Mary Church,
so he left her name Saint Mary Mosque.

60
00:03:23,740 --> 00:03:28,580
Wow. Yeah. Out of respect for the
Greater Christian majority. Huh. And,

61
00:03:28,581 --> 00:03:31,840
uh, you see my father, I
learned tolerance from him.

62
00:03:32,050 --> 00:03:35,920
He didn't have that belief in him
that, or it's a church, it's filthy.

63
00:03:35,921 --> 00:03:38,320
We can't turn it into a mosque.
It was for sale.

64
00:03:38,321 --> 00:03:40,160
The people will come to the mosque.
Well,

65
00:03:40,280 --> 00:03:44,350
none of these terrorist attacks had
happened. People were fine with mosques.

66
00:03:44,680 --> 00:03:49,340
And so the first mosque was
erected in, uh, uh, in, uh,

67
00:03:49,510 --> 00:03:52,230
Perth, Western Australia. And, uh,

68
00:03:52,270 --> 00:03:57,270
basically I grew up there until 2007
I was raised her amongst scholars and

69
00:03:59,231 --> 00:04:02,530
Islamic teachings and a very
conservative Muslim family.

70
00:04:03,070 --> 00:04:06,160
I come from what is a
conservative Muslim family mean?

71
00:04:06,220 --> 00:04:08,480
A conservative Muslim family,
uh,

72
00:04:08,650 --> 00:04:12,220
goes the extra mile to be extra religious.

73
00:04:12,221 --> 00:04:16,900
So we wouldn't even go to banks or
shopping centers that played music,

74
00:04:17,260 --> 00:04:19,750
let alone listening to music ourselves,

75
00:04:20,050 --> 00:04:24,420
whereby other Muslims would not
listen to music because it's banned in

76
00:04:24,460 --> 00:04:27,460
mainstream Islamic jurisprudence.
Uh,

77
00:04:27,660 --> 00:04:30,130
there would still go to
shopping centers and you know,

78
00:04:30,300 --> 00:04:34,480
at 10 music lessons in class,
in school, but we were very,

79
00:04:35,440 --> 00:04:39,220
very conservative. I couldn't wear
anything shiny or anything like that,

80
00:04:39,700 --> 00:04:42,280
such as watches or Nicholas
or anything like that.

81
00:04:42,320 --> 00:04:45,580
What was that like for you or just
as a young person that, you know,

82
00:04:45,581 --> 00:04:47,500
I'm sure you knew that
music was out there.

83
00:04:47,501 --> 00:04:50,230
I'm sure you knew movies were out there
in video games and the rest of it,

84
00:04:50,490 --> 00:04:55,030
I'd never been to a cinema
until I was 20 years old. Well,

85
00:04:55,090 --> 00:05:00,070
I've never actually completed a
movie. Now I'm not here to, uh, uh,

86
00:05:00,190 --> 00:05:04,420
play the oppressed person in or was harsh.
And I know you are not me,

87
00:05:04,540 --> 00:05:06,790
but I'm going to be,
I try to be as honest as I can.

88
00:05:07,060 --> 00:05:10,120
I didn't know what that life was like.

89
00:05:10,121 --> 00:05:13,300
So the life I was living was very normal.
It was,

90
00:05:13,690 --> 00:05:18,100
this is how life is to me. I didn't know
there was another life. And in fact,

91
00:05:19,060 --> 00:05:21,960
when I first moved to a,
uh,

92
00:05:22,290 --> 00:05:27,120
a public Australian school, uh, I, uh,

93
00:05:28,450 --> 00:05:32,770
was shocked that we actually had people
that were not Muslim because the school

94
00:05:32,771 --> 00:05:36,270
I grew up in was a, I was
raised in initially, uh,

95
00:05:36,460 --> 00:05:38,950
completed my initial studies in
Western Australia. There were,

96
00:05:38,990 --> 00:05:43,330
it was a private Muslim school,
also a conservative atmosphere.

97
00:05:43,510 --> 00:05:46,480
So the house was a
conservative atmosphere.

98
00:05:46,600 --> 00:05:51,600
School was a conservative atmosphere
up until 2007 I had gone back to Iran.

99
00:05:52,090 --> 00:05:54,280
And then you've got sharia law everywhere.
Wow.

100
00:05:54,310 --> 00:05:59,310
So I've never actually had time to be
open to the rest of the world and just

101
00:06:00,150 --> 00:06:03,200
accepted everyone. And that
happened after, you know,

102
00:06:03,320 --> 00:06:08,180
my family was oppressed by Isis in
2014 when I was still there studying.

103
00:06:09,080 --> 00:06:14,080
And it just hit me that this can't
be the way we were supposed to live.

104
00:06:16,550 --> 00:06:18,800
Do you remember the moment
that it hit you? Was it,

105
00:06:18,860 --> 00:06:21,890
was it finally going
because another school? No,

106
00:06:23,030 --> 00:06:27,980
I was an Islamist a fundamentalist
and an extremist as well. Okay.

107
00:06:27,981 --> 00:06:29,120
So I'm going to later in the interview,

108
00:06:29,121 --> 00:06:32,210
let's define some of those terms because
I think people get lost a little bit in

109
00:06:32,211 --> 00:06:35,600
the difference between Islamist
jihadist, fundamentalist, etc. Okay.

110
00:06:35,900 --> 00:06:40,110
So put it this way, I wouldn't
have sat with you. Yeah. Uh,

111
00:06:40,420 --> 00:06:43,250
before 2014 I wouldn't have,

112
00:06:43,290 --> 00:06:47,540
I wouldn't even shake your hand because
that was the mentality that I had

113
00:06:47,870 --> 00:06:51,770
complete rejection of the
west and I was walking in,

114
00:06:51,840 --> 00:06:56,780
in the holy city of Karbala.
It's a Shia Muslim stronghold.

115
00:06:57,470 --> 00:07:02,470
And the speakers of the sacred
shrine of [inaudible] are saying,

116
00:07:04,160 --> 00:07:06,920
and now that Mosul,
which is Mosul,

117
00:07:07,460 --> 00:07:09,500
the Iraqi city close to Baghdad,

118
00:07:09,680 --> 00:07:13,790
had fallen under the authority of Isis.

119
00:07:15,020 --> 00:07:20,000
And that's what an hour away from where
I was. So that's when it really hit me.

120
00:07:20,480 --> 00:07:23,470
And then as I tried to leave the country,
uh,

121
00:07:23,480 --> 00:07:26,630
I found a lot of struggle because
airports went out blocked.

122
00:07:26,631 --> 00:07:31,631
These guys were shooting down airplanes
and the Australian passport that I had

123
00:07:31,971 --> 00:07:36,200
saved me, I was given priority
and I returned back to Australia.

124
00:07:37,190 --> 00:07:41,840
But before all of this happened, my
uncle was kidnapped, burnt, alive,

125
00:07:42,500 --> 00:07:44,030
who served in the Iraq army.

126
00:07:44,450 --> 00:07:47,570
And we had to go receive
his body from Baghdad.

127
00:07:47,571 --> 00:07:51,260
So this whole scenario woke me up.

128
00:07:51,410 --> 00:07:56,120
And when I came to Australia, I saw
that hand got Muslims killing Muslims.

129
00:07:57,110 --> 00:08:01,970
I've been interrogated in Iran for
several times for my views and opinions.

130
00:08:02,810 --> 00:08:05,810
And the Muslims in Australia
are playing the victim card,

131
00:08:06,500 --> 00:08:07,850
recurring Islamophobia.

132
00:08:08,270 --> 00:08:12,290
So then I started to form diplomatic
relations and public relations to combat

133
00:08:12,320 --> 00:08:16,370
extremists. So what was it like
right when you got onto the scene?

134
00:08:16,371 --> 00:08:18,500
Right when you started being
more public about this?

135
00:08:18,501 --> 00:08:19,610
Cause I'll be very honest with you,

136
00:08:19,611 --> 00:08:23,450
when I first saw you on Twitter and you
were tweeting about some of these things,

137
00:08:23,930 --> 00:08:28,790
I thought I can't immediately,
everybody was like, Reuben,

138
00:08:28,791 --> 00:08:30,530
you've got to have the
amount to eating on.

139
00:08:30,531 --> 00:08:33,980
Everybody was saying it and I was like,
this guy just came out of nowhere.

140
00:08:33,981 --> 00:08:36,950
I can't just magically sit down with him.

141
00:08:36,951 --> 00:08:40,070
I am not perfectly versed in
all of these things obviously,

142
00:08:40,071 --> 00:08:43,070
and I don't want to be
used as upon basically.

143
00:08:43,280 --> 00:08:47,930
So what was it like as you started
talking about these things from the inside

144
00:08:47,931 --> 00:08:50,270
community and the outside community?
Okay.

145
00:08:50,510 --> 00:08:53,930
The inside community knew who
I was because of my lineage,

146
00:08:54,460 --> 00:08:57,300
because descend from the,

147
00:08:58,250 --> 00:08:59,880
the companions of the Prophet Mohammed,

148
00:09:00,450 --> 00:09:04,650
one of the early converts from
Christianity to Islam and you know,

149
00:09:04,680 --> 00:09:07,920
shared their wealth and the military
and the tribes and everything.

150
00:09:08,330 --> 00:09:10,460
A military power with
the Prophet Muhammad.

151
00:09:10,461 --> 00:09:13,980
And they went through it with
the Route Arabia in all the wars.

152
00:09:13,981 --> 00:09:18,960
And I've written in my book that they're
terrorists. So my prominent lineage, uh,

153
00:09:18,990 --> 00:09:20,910
my father,
my grandfather,

154
00:09:21,300 --> 00:09:24,560
and also the fact that I was
close to the ground, I told us,

155
00:09:24,561 --> 00:09:26,280
and I was ordained
publicly as like your mom.

156
00:09:26,580 --> 00:09:31,580
So the inside world of Islam knew
who I was and I still had Facebook,

157
00:09:31,890 --> 00:09:36,780
I still had Twitter, you know, very
humble following of basic following.

158
00:09:36,810 --> 00:09:41,190
And, but I was still known not that
being Twitter star you are now. Well,

159
00:09:41,760 --> 00:09:44,970
life changes. Yeah. So
what happened was the,

160
00:09:45,040 --> 00:09:49,310
there was no Naomi and there are many
forums now dating back to 2008 that

161
00:09:49,680 --> 00:09:53,610
discuss what I'm doing. So they
knew who I was. But as you,

162
00:09:53,670 --> 00:09:57,750
as you started speaking up against,
didn't have plans to speak out.

163
00:09:58,410 --> 00:10:00,220
I didn't have plans.
I'm going to be honest with you.

164
00:10:00,250 --> 00:10:02,760
Many people think that I have an agenda.
I didn't have any plans.

165
00:10:02,940 --> 00:10:06,950
I was discovered by,
look how I'm putting it as though,

166
00:10:07,550 --> 00:10:10,560
but American idol, Australian
idol, let's go. Uh,

167
00:10:10,630 --> 00:10:14,370
I got a call from channel
seven in Australia,

168
00:10:14,670 --> 00:10:17,520
one of the Best Australian
that channels top channels.

169
00:10:17,880 --> 00:10:19,620
And they had a program called tonight,
tonight.

170
00:10:19,650 --> 00:10:23,700
And apparently they googled Mrm Adelaide
Muslim, just to get a comment. Yeah.

171
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:29,000
So they came in wanting a three minute
comment on a certain issue and I gave

172
00:10:30,001 --> 00:10:34,380
them a 30 minute talk about the
Muslim community and everything.

173
00:10:34,381 --> 00:10:38,230
And so they take that and then the
director gets in touch with me and they're

174
00:10:38,231 --> 00:10:41,610
let you know, we can do a lot with
what you're saying and you have this,

175
00:10:41,611 --> 00:10:42,444
we didn't know.

176
00:10:43,080 --> 00:10:48,080
So then I became known in
the area nationally and
then internationally I had a

177
00:10:48,571 --> 00:10:52,170
few heated exchanges on
Australian television.

178
00:10:53,070 --> 00:10:57,780
Sunrise. Yeah. Were those
usually with a suspect?

179
00:10:57,781 --> 00:11:02,220
They were proudly with white people
on the left. Is that fair to say?

180
00:11:02,760 --> 00:11:05,280
Or maybe maybe with people
more extreme on there? Right.

181
00:11:05,640 --> 00:11:10,640
Well we did have several interviews where
the host was a leftist and the other

182
00:11:13,651 --> 00:11:17,690
guest was an extremist Muslim
and they would gang up on me,

183
00:11:18,210 --> 00:11:21,600
give him more time and not giving me
the right of reply or for let's say,

184
00:11:21,601 --> 00:11:26,310
you know you're doing something right
or articles about me without even asking

185
00:11:26,311 --> 00:11:30,720
my opinion or just pops up article one,
article two,

186
00:11:30,721 --> 00:11:31,441
article three.

187
00:11:31,441 --> 00:11:36,270
And so were you shocked once you started
talking about these issues and the

188
00:11:36,271 --> 00:11:39,840
problems that you see within Islam and
the and the solutions that you see?

189
00:11:40,140 --> 00:11:44,740
Were you shocked, were you were
getting comfort from and where are you?

190
00:11:44,740 --> 00:11:48,480
We're getting hatred from?
I always absolutely confused.

191
00:11:48,481 --> 00:11:53,100
Confused is the right word to put it
because on one hand I've got politicians,

192
00:11:53,470 --> 00:11:58,180
me telling me that you are an asset,
you speak English,

193
00:11:58,360 --> 00:12:01,960
you're young, you're presenting
yourself well, you know how to talk.

194
00:12:02,110 --> 00:12:05,470
You're against the extremist.
You love Australia clean record,

195
00:12:05,710 --> 00:12:08,590
we need you but not publicly.

196
00:12:09,370 --> 00:12:12,430
So that really hurt because
what do you mean not publicly?

197
00:12:13,180 --> 00:12:15,130
You want to work with me behind the scene,

198
00:12:15,700 --> 00:12:19,420
but you still want to visit the extremists
for votes. Why wouldn't they want, oh,

199
00:12:19,540 --> 00:12:21,070
so that's purely votes because,

200
00:12:21,071 --> 00:12:25,340
so that really does tell you about some
demographics that does does. So they'll,

201
00:12:25,360 --> 00:12:30,360
they'll sit with me privately and these
meetings aren't official meetings.

202
00:12:30,991 --> 00:12:35,760
It's not enough. I would actually have
my, my turban on the side and we're just,

203
00:12:35,830 --> 00:12:37,780
I'll open some buttons and we just,

204
00:12:37,980 --> 00:12:40,330
it was a very relaxed gathering with
this politics. Should the record,

205
00:12:40,331 --> 00:12:45,220
you walked in here a turban lists her
man and without the robes. So just FYI.

206
00:12:45,370 --> 00:12:49,990
And it was a very uh,
friendly gathering with the gifts.

207
00:12:50,200 --> 00:12:55,200
We would exchange gifts but as soon as
the issue turned public it's like they're

208
00:12:55,601 --> 00:12:56,434
not normally.

209
00:12:56,800 --> 00:13:00,400
So that almost gets to the heart of
exactly why the discussion around Islam is

210
00:13:00,401 --> 00:13:05,401
so difficult because every time someone
tries to come in and talk some sense

211
00:13:06,521 --> 00:13:10,570
about the difference between an ideology
and people and all of the sort of

212
00:13:10,571 --> 00:13:13,840
moderate things that I see you
talking about all the time.

213
00:13:14,530 --> 00:13:16,540
You guys are the ones that
get thrown under the bus.

214
00:13:16,570 --> 00:13:17,740
There's so many examples of this.

215
00:13:17,741 --> 00:13:20,350
I've almost every minority that
tries to fight from within,

216
00:13:20,530 --> 00:13:23,770
they're the ones that get thrown under
the bus and then all that does is

217
00:13:23,771 --> 00:13:25,060
strengthen the extremist.

218
00:13:25,780 --> 00:13:30,780
I think what helped me a lot was the
fact that I had a political adviser and

219
00:13:31,331 --> 00:13:35,380
then who worked in the,
in the Australian parliament for 40 years,

220
00:13:35,440 --> 00:13:39,820
retired now. Uh, Australian.
So born in Australia,

221
00:13:39,880 --> 00:13:43,370
non Muslim, yeah. And can I ask
you his name? Just know. Okay.

222
00:13:43,420 --> 00:13:46,590
I'm really sorry because I
feared for his safety. Okay.

223
00:13:46,960 --> 00:13:51,960
And basically this man was giving me
advice as to how to handle the media

224
00:13:52,121 --> 00:13:55,330
because look, Dave, you asked
me a question about how I felt.

225
00:13:56,200 --> 00:14:00,880
Let me just give you one scenario so you
know exactly what was going through my

226
00:14:00,881 --> 00:14:03,880
mind.
I'm criticizing extremists on Twitter.

227
00:14:04,390 --> 00:14:09,100
I get a phone call from the uh,
ABC in Australia.

228
00:14:09,940 --> 00:14:13,570
This is the, the main Australian
Broadcasting Corporation.

229
00:14:13,930 --> 00:14:18,930
And they asked me what is my opinion about
claims that I am aligning myself with

230
00:14:19,961 --> 00:14:23,950
the right? And I said, what
is the right? I did not know.

231
00:14:24,640 --> 00:14:28,510
So I came from a completely a
conservative Muslim background.

232
00:14:28,511 --> 00:14:31,600
Now I'm trying to serve humanity.

233
00:14:31,601 --> 00:14:35,470
This is my only agenda to so going against
the extremist and someone's telling

234
00:14:35,471 --> 00:14:39,790
me that there's lifting is right now I
have to sit back and try to understand

235
00:14:39,791 --> 00:14:43,420
what's happening. All right?
So which politician that I
met with was on the right,

236
00:14:43,450 --> 00:14:44,380
which one was on the left.

237
00:14:44,590 --> 00:14:47,560
We're trying to put everything
together and get some perspective.

238
00:14:48,430 --> 00:14:50,980
And that was one of the
things that really confused.

239
00:14:51,110 --> 00:14:55,070
So it was really good to have a political
adviser two and a half years ago

240
00:14:55,670 --> 00:14:58,380
because he told me exactly
what was going on. Yeah.

241
00:14:58,520 --> 00:15:00,980
So what about the reaction from
within the community though?

242
00:15:00,981 --> 00:15:03,530
I would imagine once you start
talking about these things,

243
00:15:03,710 --> 00:15:06,950
often the reaction from
within the community is going
to be even worse because

244
00:15:06,951 --> 00:15:10,370
now you're a trader and a
sellout and the rest of it,

245
00:15:10,670 --> 00:15:15,670
the community reaction was very fast and
evaporate quickly because if the mom's

246
00:15:19,641 --> 00:15:22,760
state silence,
if the lead is carried on,

247
00:15:23,570 --> 00:15:26,150
then it would be a different scenario.
So what do you make of that?

248
00:15:26,620 --> 00:15:30,920
I make that the lead is a agree with me
because they still come to my house and

249
00:15:30,921 --> 00:15:34,190
we have dinners and no problem.
But they don't want any photos.

250
00:15:34,880 --> 00:15:36,200
But I do have photos,

251
00:15:36,440 --> 00:15:41,440
but I share that with the
people in government to know
what the progress is with

252
00:15:43,041 --> 00:15:47,540
what I'm doing. I'm not a one man
band who's walking around with nobody.

253
00:15:47,541 --> 00:15:51,870
No Muslim leaders come to my house and
we have amazing dinners and we talk about

254
00:15:51,930 --> 00:15:52,763
Muslim issues,

255
00:15:53,180 --> 00:15:56,780
but the community will reject them if
they know that they have relations with me

256
00:15:57,090 --> 00:15:59,420
in a way that does that type of person.

257
00:15:59,421 --> 00:16:02,870
Although I can sympathize with their
position, right. They don't want it.

258
00:16:02,900 --> 00:16:05,570
They don't want their congregation to
turn on them or something like that.

259
00:16:05,810 --> 00:16:09,950
But that type of person that gives
you the quiet support but won't do it

260
00:16:09,951 --> 00:16:13,820
publicly, isn't an in a way the
most frustrating type of support.

261
00:16:14,090 --> 00:16:17,060
I find that I've also many people that
will come up to me, public people,

262
00:16:17,061 --> 00:16:20,000
people were famous with plenty more money
and all sorts of things that come up

263
00:16:20,001 --> 00:16:22,700
to me and say, David, you know, I really
love your show. And I have, I'm sorry,

264
00:16:22,701 --> 00:16:24,650
I can't tweet about it.
I just don't want to get in hot water

265
00:16:24,920 --> 00:16:28,670
or, or, and I think this is a theme
amongst a lot of the people that,

266
00:16:28,780 --> 00:16:32,990
that were sort of connected
to. Um, it's frustrating,

267
00:16:33,080 --> 00:16:37,430
but I also appreciate it because at least
I know who's on my side and who will

268
00:16:37,431 --> 00:16:41,630
not attack me with a fatwa
without me knowing. So it's good.

269
00:16:41,660 --> 00:16:44,830
I don't appreciate the sign at once.
Is there a co fat,

270
00:16:44,831 --> 00:16:47,900
why could we get a fat while on both
of us? Right? There would be amazing.

271
00:16:47,930 --> 00:16:50,960
It's like an episode of curb your
enthusiasm, but it would be amazing.

272
00:16:51,490 --> 00:16:55,210
But it would certainly paved the way for,
for other people to get fed to us.

273
00:16:55,220 --> 00:16:59,060
So I don't know how we would feel about
that. Right, right. We can deal with it.

274
00:16:59,100 --> 00:17:01,370
We can, we can. Um,

275
00:17:02,070 --> 00:17:02,251
okay.

276
00:17:02,251 --> 00:17:07,251
So let's just do a little bit of sort of
Islam one o one and sort of how to talk

277
00:17:08,131 --> 00:17:09,000
about these issues.

278
00:17:09,390 --> 00:17:13,530
So when I first sort of became
interested in all of this,

279
00:17:13,560 --> 00:17:16,230
most of my audience knows my
sort of political evolution,

280
00:17:16,650 --> 00:17:20,820
but it was the night and I,
I suspect you've probably
seen this, that Sam Harris,

281
00:17:20,821 --> 00:17:24,720
the neuroscientists was on real time with
Bill Maher and they were talking about

282
00:17:24,840 --> 00:17:28,320
the difference between Islam,
a set of ideas and Muslims as people.

283
00:17:28,321 --> 00:17:29,550
And that you shouldn't be prejudice,

284
00:17:29,551 --> 00:17:31,350
but you should be allowed
to criticize ideas.

285
00:17:31,710 --> 00:17:36,030
And the line that sort of
caught the internet on fire
was Ben Aflac Calling Bill

286
00:17:36,030 --> 00:17:40,560
Maher in Sam Harris, gross and racist. He
said, that's gross and racist. And for me,

287
00:17:40,561 --> 00:17:44,670
and I was, that was a progressive at the
time and the whole thing. Um, I thought,

288
00:17:44,671 --> 00:17:48,810
Whoa, this just captures everything
that I've seen wrong with my,

289
00:17:49,650 --> 00:17:54,000
the inability to deal with
a complex issue honestly.

290
00:17:54,001 --> 00:17:58,710
And that the immediate charge is you
must be racist, you must be a bigot.

291
00:17:58,711 --> 00:18:02,010
And the rest of it. So first off, can
you just talk a little bit about that?

292
00:18:02,011 --> 00:18:06,420
Just how you can talk about a doctrine,
any doctrine, but in this case, you know,

293
00:18:06,421 --> 00:18:10,260
through an Islamic Lens and then how,
how you can do that,

294
00:18:10,261 --> 00:18:13,260
but then not be racist or
prejudice towards people.

295
00:18:13,960 --> 00:18:14,793
Okay.

296
00:18:15,220 --> 00:18:20,220
That's a very dangerous area to fall
into because I'm not a political

297
00:18:21,341 --> 00:18:22,174
commentator.

298
00:18:22,630 --> 00:18:26,890
I am trying to change the
mentality of a community,

299
00:18:27,340 --> 00:18:29,890
at least on a local level.
Socially,

300
00:18:30,280 --> 00:18:33,280
I might not be able to change Mecca
and changed the whole religion,

301
00:18:33,550 --> 00:18:38,490
but at least where we live,
we want to have a peaceful community.

302
00:18:38,540 --> 00:18:43,540
So I'm trying to present a better example
for the moderates or the vulnerable

303
00:18:45,020 --> 00:18:49,390
ones, then the extremist
Islam in their own mosque.

304
00:18:49,930 --> 00:18:54,930
So it is a very dangerous field because
the moment you lose their trust,

305
00:18:55,540 --> 00:19:00,540
you lose a Muslim Muslim man's trust
or any Muslim individuals trust.

306
00:19:01,960 --> 00:19:03,790
If you then recite the Quran,

307
00:19:04,060 --> 00:19:07,960
they'll say you're lying because
they lost her trust. It's finished,

308
00:19:08,230 --> 00:19:09,400
they're not trust you anymore.

309
00:19:09,940 --> 00:19:14,940
And I find that very difficult
to get that point across.

310
00:19:15,790 --> 00:19:16,271
However,

311
00:19:16,271 --> 00:19:21,271
what I do is I use a lot of
quotations and so it's not my words.

312
00:19:21,730 --> 00:19:26,730
I quote certain issues and I refer to
certain social events and I comment on

313
00:19:27,461 --> 00:19:28,294
them.

314
00:19:28,390 --> 00:19:32,620
So I try my best not to make any
statements from myself because the,

315
00:19:32,680 --> 00:19:36,190
the level of mentality within
the Muslim world is that, okay,

316
00:19:36,400 --> 00:19:40,270
as long as it has a divine coating,
then we'll accept it.

317
00:19:40,810 --> 00:19:44,620
If it's from he be himself,
then it's manmade.

318
00:19:45,130 --> 00:19:47,260
So if it's divine,
they also can't reject it.

319
00:19:47,920 --> 00:19:50,110
So I tried to use a lot of quotations.

320
00:19:50,180 --> 00:19:50,391
Okay.

321
00:19:50,391 --> 00:19:54,080
So can you give me an example of say a
quotation and then how you would approach

322
00:19:54,081 --> 00:19:54,500
it?

323
00:19:54,500 --> 00:19:57,950
Definitely. For example,
when I speak against stoning,

324
00:19:58,880 --> 00:20:01,970
I can refer to the more
secret book outside the crime,

325
00:20:01,971 --> 00:20:06,971
the Makati and show that this stoning
began when two monkeys were throwing rocks

326
00:20:08,631 --> 00:20:12,350
at each other in Behati
throwing rocks at each other.

327
00:20:12,680 --> 00:20:17,540
And the companion of Mohammed saw them
and said, okay, so that, that must be,

328
00:20:17,541 --> 00:20:20,830
must be a female. I must've cheated
on that mail. So he's stolen, incur.

329
00:20:20,990 --> 00:20:24,920
So we must apply that. And this is
the more sacred book after the Quran.

330
00:20:25,640 --> 00:20:30,220
And the Quran itself does not have a
verse on stolen it because a goat eight of

331
00:20:30,230 --> 00:20:31,063
that verse.

332
00:20:31,370 --> 00:20:36,020
So what I do is I bring to the sacred
scriptures that speak them at stoning how

333
00:20:36,021 --> 00:20:37,250
it began with monkeys.

334
00:20:37,460 --> 00:20:41,240
And it began and the verse that was
supposedly there was eaten by a goat.

335
00:20:41,241 --> 00:20:44,450
And I quickly say, well,
this is a monkey teaching.

336
00:20:45,410 --> 00:20:49,810
It sounds finally as hell. I'm having a
go at them. But the evidence is there.

337
00:20:49,930 --> 00:20:54,010
Yeah. Um, okay. So we can,

338
00:20:54,040 --> 00:20:55,600
we can talk about these issues.

339
00:20:55,601 --> 00:21:00,340
A certain amount of people all over the
map are gonna not be happy with either

340
00:21:00,341 --> 00:21:03,280
one of us.
What do you have,

341
00:21:03,310 --> 00:21:07,360
do you have proof of some of the inroads
that you've been able to make in terms

342
00:21:07,361 --> 00:21:09,190
of d radicalizing people?

343
00:21:11,110 --> 00:21:15,640
The extremists are so frustrated with me.
They're trying to ban the,

344
00:21:15,641 --> 00:21:19,060
I've got diplomats and the Pakistan
government that tried to shut me down.

345
00:21:19,810 --> 00:21:22,820
Uh, are you banned on Facebook
as we tape this right now?

346
00:21:22,880 --> 00:21:24,260
You were band a couple of days ago.

347
00:21:24,320 --> 00:21:26,860
Can you just explain to people what
you posted because I retweeted it.

348
00:21:26,861 --> 00:21:28,460
It's incredible. I didn't,
I wasn't sure if the band,

349
00:21:28,610 --> 00:21:31,280
the band was still awful while I was
cause they hopefully it's still out by the

350
00:21:31,281 --> 00:21:33,620
time we post this in a couple of days,
but hopefully not

351
00:21:34,090 --> 00:21:38,440
the, uh, amazing Song Jihad Bells,

352
00:21:38,441 --> 00:21:39,221
Jihad bells.

353
00:21:39,221 --> 00:21:44,221
Do you handle the way I got that song
and I posted it on Facebook and I said I

354
00:21:45,011 --> 00:21:50,011
share this song every Christmas
because the extremists don't like it.

355
00:21:50,950 --> 00:21:53,660
Therefore please share
it. And it's, it's a,

356
00:21:53,661 --> 00:21:56,680
it's a funny song at ridicules
them for what they're doing.

357
00:21:57,460 --> 00:22:02,460
And Facebook shut me down for 30 days and
said that was hate speech and that was

358
00:22:04,751 --> 00:22:06,220
it.
So I find it very ridiculous.

359
00:22:06,250 --> 00:22:10,010
This is the mind time Facebook
has blocked me or bang,

360
00:22:10,020 --> 00:22:14,890
you're a published my page
completely in 2018 so it's,

361
00:22:15,280 --> 00:22:17,650
you know, the Twitter has
never suspended me. Not once.

362
00:22:17,760 --> 00:22:18,720
Yeah,
nothing.

363
00:22:18,840 --> 00:22:23,010
What do you make of what's going on with
our ability to talk about these issues

364
00:22:23,040 --> 00:22:25,800
online?
So you haven't been suspended by Twitter,

365
00:22:25,801 --> 00:22:28,080
but this has happened a bunch
of times on Facebook. Yes.

366
00:22:28,470 --> 00:22:31,230
Do you know my friend Faisal
Al Mutar chance. So Faisal,

367
00:22:31,231 --> 00:22:33,840
who is one of my best friends on
earth, I love the guy, I adore him.

368
00:22:33,990 --> 00:22:37,260
He has been banned several
times for tweeting out,

369
00:22:37,261 --> 00:22:41,160
similar or for posting on Facebook.
Several things like that. It's like,

370
00:22:41,400 --> 00:22:42,450
did they realize,

371
00:22:42,451 --> 00:22:45,660
do you think they realize they're actually
emboldening the extremists the more

372
00:22:45,661 --> 00:22:47,730
they try to take people like you out?

373
00:22:48,650 --> 00:22:48,981
Well,

374
00:22:48,981 --> 00:22:53,660
they definitely do because the extremist
only operate as much as they do because

375
00:22:53,661 --> 00:22:58,661
they know that they can operate with
no criticism or if there is criticism,

376
00:22:59,631 --> 00:23:02,780
it's only one or two accounts
that are speaking against them.

377
00:23:02,840 --> 00:23:05,360
So by shutting me down,
I mean,

378
00:23:05,430 --> 00:23:07,940
that's a big win for the Jihad.

379
00:23:07,941 --> 00:23:12,941
This because let's not forget jihadist
use Facebook friend recommendations to

380
00:23:13,911 --> 00:23:17,390
build cyber societies,
the cyber caliphate.

381
00:23:17,420 --> 00:23:20,480
And it's a real study that
Facebook's been falling into.

382
00:23:20,481 --> 00:23:22,760
This trap where it's,

383
00:23:23,060 --> 00:23:26,270
it's website recommends Jihad this
to each other based on the pages.

384
00:23:26,271 --> 00:23:27,610
They're like,
yeah.

385
00:23:27,770 --> 00:23:31,820
So now they have this community
and Twitter is the same.

386
00:23:31,910 --> 00:23:33,860
Twitter recommend friends to each other.

387
00:23:34,160 --> 00:23:39,160
So these guys have that advantage
with the help of Facebook and Twitter,

388
00:23:39,950 --> 00:23:42,890
but we don't,
when someone likes my page,

389
00:23:43,250 --> 00:23:46,250
the next person that comes on is a right

390
00:23:46,250 --> 00:23:50,150
wing figure. So the people say, okay,
we're not going to like this page.

391
00:23:50,151 --> 00:23:52,460
I'm going to unfollow this guy
too. Yeah, it's incredible.

392
00:23:52,461 --> 00:23:56,390
You're fighting an ideological war at
some level and a, and an algorithmic war.

393
00:23:56,540 --> 00:24:00,770
Yes. I had another level. So let's
just do some of the definitional stuff.

394
00:24:01,100 --> 00:24:04,460
Um, so first off you, you've
mentioned moderate Muslims sometimes.

395
00:24:04,461 --> 00:24:08,480
So what would you say are the categories,
so to speak of of Muslim

396
00:24:08,510 --> 00:24:13,210
people? Okay, well there's a Muslim who
believes in God, believes in the prophet,

397
00:24:13,211 --> 00:24:18,211
Mohammed's believes in the Quran
and just an average person who,

398
00:24:19,061 --> 00:24:21,760
and this is me speaking in the West,
uh,

399
00:24:22,210 --> 00:24:25,960
believes that they should pray
five times a day fast in Ramadan,

400
00:24:25,961 --> 00:24:29,860
seller based the Muslim celebrations.
That's about it.

401
00:24:30,040 --> 00:24:31,800
That's the definition of a Muslim.
Yeah.

402
00:24:32,270 --> 00:24:35,280
But can you be less than that and
still be Muslim so to speak. So you,

403
00:24:35,281 --> 00:24:38,540
so you couldn't be just sort
of nominally secular Muslim,

404
00:24:38,750 --> 00:24:42,350
where do you don't pray five
times a day or are Muslim by name?

405
00:24:42,800 --> 00:24:45,080
So you would say that.
Would you say that to ex Muslim?

406
00:24:45,110 --> 00:24:47,630
So there is a girl I wanted to ask you
about the ex Muslim community also,

407
00:24:47,631 --> 00:24:50,660
but so you would say that's just,
you would say that's actually not Muslim,

408
00:24:50,661 --> 00:24:51,560
that's just sort of,

409
00:24:52,790 --> 00:24:55,850
look I'm Muslim.
The term Muslim,

410
00:24:57,170 --> 00:25:01,100
it's taken from Islam,
which means submission.

411
00:25:01,101 --> 00:25:04,400
So when it's a verb and Muslim
is a man who submitting,

412
00:25:04,401 --> 00:25:08,870
so you're everyday you're praying so
you are upholding that name of being a

413
00:25:08,871 --> 00:25:11,750
Muslim. If you don't pray
then you just Muslim by name,

414
00:25:11,751 --> 00:25:13,950
you're not an actual Muslim,

415
00:25:14,780 --> 00:25:17,420
you're not an ex Muslim because you
haven't been announced the religion,

416
00:25:17,690 --> 00:25:20,900
you just missing prayers
or drinking alcohol. Right.

417
00:25:21,070 --> 00:25:23,440
So do you have any idea
the number is a bad amount?

418
00:25:23,441 --> 00:25:27,850
I would imagine in the West that that's
probably a very large percentage of

419
00:25:27,851 --> 00:25:28,684
Muslims.

420
00:25:28,710 --> 00:25:32,990
The majority of Muslims believe
in God and uh, and uh, and pray.

421
00:25:33,320 --> 00:25:35,690
And there are also Muslims
that believe in God.

422
00:25:35,720 --> 00:25:37,610
I love believe in Mohammed but don't pray.
Right.

423
00:25:38,000 --> 00:25:40,730
So I wouldn't say that's an issue for us.

424
00:25:40,760 --> 00:25:43,490
They can pray or not pray whenever they,

425
00:25:43,500 --> 00:25:47,720
like for me it's the more extremist
ones and then trying to differentiate

426
00:25:47,721 --> 00:25:49,110
between the moderate and the extreme.

427
00:25:49,240 --> 00:25:51,740
Right. Okay. So we've got sort
of just the ones by name only.

428
00:25:51,741 --> 00:25:54,770
I gather the ones who let's say
aren't practicing but, but still are,

429
00:25:54,800 --> 00:25:56,060
they were born Muslim.
There was,

430
00:25:56,061 --> 00:25:59,720
and then the ones who are not practicing
on the ones the WISC refers to as

431
00:25:59,721 --> 00:26:01,130
moderates.
Right.

432
00:26:01,131 --> 00:26:03,740
So that's where I was trying to get with
this to understand what your definition

433
00:26:03,741 --> 00:26:04,580
of moderate is.
Yeah.

434
00:26:04,990 --> 00:26:07,600
It's the ones who don't practice.
And by not practicing,

435
00:26:07,630 --> 00:26:12,110
I mean the other laws of
Islam. So for example, the uh,

436
00:26:12,120 --> 00:26:13,630
the stoning of the killing,

437
00:26:13,660 --> 00:26:18,660
the reporting on people who break the
blasphemy law issues like the people who

438
00:26:19,460 --> 00:26:21,580
just don't care.
I just want to go to work nine to five,

439
00:26:21,581 --> 00:26:25,420
come back and raise a family, you
know, live life, go on holidays. Yeah.

440
00:26:25,450 --> 00:26:27,880
Parents were Muslim. We born
Muslim, but that's about it.

441
00:26:28,300 --> 00:26:30,970
These guys are the ones who
are referred to as moderates,

442
00:26:32,020 --> 00:26:35,890
but they're not really moderates.
The moderate is the,

443
00:26:36,280 --> 00:26:38,020
the ex, the, the, the,

444
00:26:38,310 --> 00:26:43,310
the Muslim that is conservative
but wishes to ban certain,

445
00:26:45,550 --> 00:26:49,470
uh, teaching, setting verdicts.
They are the moderates.

446
00:26:49,670 --> 00:26:54,170
So the moderate is the one who sort of
staying within the religion and fighting

447
00:26:54,171 --> 00:26:55,940
the extreme parts of the religion

448
00:26:56,800 --> 00:27:01,090
personally on a family level, not raising
their children in extremist mosques.

449
00:27:01,590 --> 00:27:02,770
Those on the mothers.

450
00:27:02,860 --> 00:27:05,500
Okay. And then you obviously
include yourself in that.

451
00:27:06,250 --> 00:27:08,870
Well, uh, well I can see why this
would be a tough question for them.

452
00:27:08,900 --> 00:27:13,900
I don't believe in something called the
mother Islam now just for the viewers

453
00:27:14,550 --> 00:27:15,830
don't get confused.
Yeah,

454
00:27:15,980 --> 00:27:20,120
I'm answering your question based on
what society and what Islam Sates.

455
00:27:20,300 --> 00:27:22,850
My personal opinion
could be another thing.

456
00:27:23,630 --> 00:27:26,930
So you might want to ask me what
my opinion is on this issue.

457
00:27:27,020 --> 00:27:29,900
I don't believe there's a mother of,
let's pretend I asked you your opinion.

458
00:27:30,440 --> 00:27:35,270
There is no mother Islam.
Islam is Islam and uh,

459
00:27:35,450 --> 00:27:40,450
you're either a reformist I reformer
or reformed person or you're still on

460
00:27:40,791 --> 00:27:41,624
Muslim.

461
00:27:42,230 --> 00:27:47,130
The Muslims were doing to chop the
handle of the fee if and don't stolen and

462
00:27:47,370 --> 00:27:51,700
don't, uh, you know, applying
the violence of Sharia law there,

463
00:27:51,701 --> 00:27:54,920
they've diverted away from
the core beliefs of Islam.

464
00:27:56,020 --> 00:28:00,250
So in a weird way,
you're an e mom who also,

465
00:28:00,280 --> 00:28:03,190
you obviously have a great,
affinity is not the right word.

466
00:28:03,350 --> 00:28:06,700
You have a great respect,
I suppose for the,

467
00:28:06,701 --> 00:28:08,410
for the ex Muslims in a way,

468
00:28:09,490 --> 00:28:14,490
the extra Muslims have every
right to be where they are.

469
00:28:15,020 --> 00:28:15,280
Yeah.

470
00:28:15,280 --> 00:28:20,280
Because now is the west top to be a Muslim
and when I'm Muslim has a problem or

471
00:28:22,961 --> 00:28:26,800
is facing a problem, whether it
be inheritance, financial issues,

472
00:28:26,980 --> 00:28:31,540
abuse at home, divorced after
being married off. You know,

473
00:28:31,541 --> 00:28:35,890
at a very young age they don't find
the person who listens to them.

474
00:28:36,760 --> 00:28:41,760
The majority of moms in mosques have
zero qualifications when it comes to

475
00:28:42,731 --> 00:28:45,940
counseling. When it comes to
solving real life problems,

476
00:28:46,150 --> 00:28:49,060
they only know how to talk
when it's against Israel,

477
00:28:49,061 --> 00:28:53,440
against the Jews and to play the victim
card and basically spread news about

478
00:28:53,441 --> 00:28:56,710
what they're doing in society.
So the ex Muslims,

479
00:28:56,800 --> 00:29:00,610
the majority of them leave the
religion because number one,

480
00:29:00,970 --> 00:29:02,590
they really feel it's
not for them anymore.

481
00:29:03,490 --> 00:29:08,020
And the people who paved
the way for them. Uh, right.

482
00:29:08,021 --> 00:29:13,021
I do know that some people read Richard
Dawkins or read certain books and then

483
00:29:13,091 --> 00:29:15,970
changed their religion or
leave religion completely.

484
00:29:16,240 --> 00:29:21,160
But Isis makes more ex Muslims
than any intellectual in the West.

485
00:29:22,210 --> 00:29:26,980
So to, if we want to blame
x Muslim for me ex Muslim,

486
00:29:27,090 --> 00:29:30,160
it's the Muslim, the fundamentalist
Muslims that made them ex Muslim.

487
00:29:30,810 --> 00:29:33,030
They are the ones who are
making them leave the religion

488
00:29:33,120 --> 00:29:36,900
and that's completely contrary to what
the media would portray about this.

489
00:29:36,901 --> 00:29:39,780
They would say it's,
it's that if you talk about any of this,

490
00:29:39,781 --> 00:29:43,990
you're driving people to become
extremists, which as many people call it,

491
00:29:43,991 --> 00:29:46,000
this is the soft bigotry
of low expectations.

492
00:29:46,150 --> 00:29:48,400
If I was to say anything
that might offend you,

493
00:29:48,640 --> 00:29:50,350
you would automatically
become an extremist,

494
00:29:50,351 --> 00:29:54,510
which is such a horrific way of viewing
a, another human being. You know,

495
00:29:54,520 --> 00:29:57,130
is there something that I could say to
you that somehow you might end up blowing

496
00:29:57,131 --> 00:30:01,700
me up? Nothing. If you were to
kill me and I'll come back to low,

497
00:30:01,710 --> 00:30:02,543
I'd still have,

498
00:30:03,730 --> 00:30:07,000
I still shake your head or you got
another to worry about brother. Um, okay.

499
00:30:07,001 --> 00:30:09,640
So let, let's just do a little bit
more of, of the deaf. Okay. So wait,

500
00:30:09,641 --> 00:30:13,300
so we have sort of the ex Muslims
and the nominal Muslim then,

501
00:30:13,330 --> 00:30:17,230
then the moderate that you say
is not really a thing actually.

502
00:30:17,380 --> 00:30:21,040
Then can you sort of explain, uh,
Islamists and jihadists. Okay.

503
00:30:21,970 --> 00:30:23,860
And if there's anything else
that I missed within that

504
00:30:24,360 --> 00:30:29,360
Islamist is an individual that believes
in preaching and spreading and expanding

505
00:30:31,650 --> 00:30:35,610
Islam and the message of
Islam through militant means.

506
00:30:36,180 --> 00:30:41,180
So there would spread Islam by the
sword and now the tactics are a bit

507
00:30:41,851 --> 00:30:44,400
different.
Now it's getting through congress.

508
00:30:45,210 --> 00:30:46,860
So before it was by the sword,

509
00:30:47,160 --> 00:30:51,900
now it's getting themselves
into parliament and then
making laws that act as the

510
00:30:51,901 --> 00:30:55,020
sword, the Islamophobia law in
Canada and one or three. Yeah.

511
00:30:55,620 --> 00:31:00,620
So an Islamist would silence
you just to spread his agenda.

512
00:31:02,640 --> 00:31:05,250
That's different from a Muslim,
I'm Muslim would say, okay,

513
00:31:05,460 --> 00:31:08,360
this is the Koran I
believe is the right God.

514
00:31:08,400 --> 00:31:11,220
I believe Islam is true except
that you don't accept it.

515
00:31:11,221 --> 00:31:12,760
You're not going to be
saved. Goodnight. Goodnight.

516
00:31:12,870 --> 00:31:17,870
That's basically a Muslim and Islam
most will actually go the extra mile of

517
00:31:18,331 --> 00:31:22,260
kidnapping someone because they drank
alcohol a whipping them because they

518
00:31:22,261 --> 00:31:24,930
believe that is the right thing to do.
We've seen across Europe,

519
00:31:25,230 --> 00:31:29,430
statues are being destroyed
because it's not allowed in Islam.

520
00:31:29,730 --> 00:31:34,730
So that's an Islamist and Islamist
organization would be Hamas.

521
00:31:35,761 --> 00:31:40,680
Hamas is an Islamist organization
that did terrorist. Uh, doings,

522
00:31:40,681 --> 00:31:42,690
it's responsible for terrorist activities.

523
00:31:42,691 --> 00:31:44,430
So then it became a
terrorist organization.

524
00:31:44,610 --> 00:31:46,950
But its ideology is an Islamist ideology.

525
00:31:47,100 --> 00:31:49,620
So two state solution is not an option.

526
00:31:50,340 --> 00:31:53,730
They need to be eliminated because
our message is the right one.

527
00:31:54,120 --> 00:31:56,880
That's an Islamist mentality.

528
00:31:57,870 --> 00:32:02,870
Now the other person or the other group
of people would be the fundamentalists,

529
00:32:03,060 --> 00:32:08,060
a fundamentalist Muslim once to preserve
the message of Prophet Mohammed and

530
00:32:09,361 --> 00:32:13,230
live like Mohammed the same way he lived.
So if the report,

531
00:32:13,231 --> 00:32:17,490
say Mohammad had a short pants because
his pants would stop to his ankle,

532
00:32:17,640 --> 00:32:18,990
they'd go to the university,

533
00:32:19,140 --> 00:32:21,960
Harvard University and with
their ankles sticking out.

534
00:32:22,500 --> 00:32:25,470
So if there was no deodorant in Macau,
we're not going to use the order.

535
00:32:25,470 --> 00:32:29,400
And if they, if Mohammad never
trimmed his beard with a blade,

536
00:32:29,430 --> 00:32:32,340
then we're not going to use a blade
on ours. That's a fundamentalist.

537
00:32:32,430 --> 00:32:36,660
And these guys will always take the
side of the Islamist rather than the

538
00:32:36,661 --> 00:32:40,940
moderate. And also moderate it
just a politically created term.

539
00:32:40,941 --> 00:32:44,660
It's a political term to differentiate.
But at the end of the day,

540
00:32:45,200 --> 00:32:48,170
I don't believe there's one that you in
the Muslim iron arts and then there are

541
00:32:48,171 --> 00:32:51,980
liberals in faith as
to how deep you on how,

542
00:32:52,100 --> 00:32:55,990
how much into the religion you are.
So where does the jihadist fit into that?

543
00:32:55,991 --> 00:33:00,991
Because I thought that was a little bit
of your definition of a Islamist because

544
00:33:01,131 --> 00:33:02,900
of the,
because of the use of violence,

545
00:33:03,920 --> 00:33:08,330
the Islamist isn't always a jihadist.
Islam is,

546
00:33:08,340 --> 00:33:13,340
can be someone who believes in the
ideology of spreading Islam by violence,

547
00:33:16,520 --> 00:33:19,940
who believes that's the right way,
that's how religion should develop.

548
00:33:20,270 --> 00:33:24,200
But they don't actually go and fight.
You know who these people are?

549
00:33:24,300 --> 00:33:25,730
The majority of the moms,

550
00:33:26,930 --> 00:33:30,860
so they're sitting in their mosques
recruiting, sending people to Isis,

551
00:33:30,861 --> 00:33:35,861
but they're not jihadists that in Momma's
responsible for the jihadist growing

552
00:33:37,041 --> 00:33:38,360
and fun joining Isis.

553
00:33:38,570 --> 00:33:42,280
So here's the Islamist
and he would send the,

554
00:33:42,830 --> 00:33:47,390
the Islamist congregation
to them become jihadists.

555
00:33:47,420 --> 00:33:48,141
So this is when,

556
00:33:48,141 --> 00:33:51,770
when people talk about the radicalization
that's happening in mosques in the

557
00:33:51,771 --> 00:33:54,380
West,
you believe that to be a real thing.

558
00:33:54,650 --> 00:33:57,800
Of course it is a real thing and it's
something we battle every single day.

559
00:33:59,980 --> 00:34:03,840
What? So what if I was to
go into one of these marks,

560
00:34:04,660 --> 00:34:09,200
what would I be hearing? Well,
firstly, because of your beard,

561
00:34:09,290 --> 00:34:13,940
you'd be welcome to lengthen this a
little bit. Okay. So you'd be welcome.

562
00:34:13,990 --> 00:34:14,440
Okay.

563
00:34:14,440 --> 00:34:18,620
And a fundamentalist mosque would there
would definitely frown upon you if you

564
00:34:18,621 --> 00:34:21,950
had shaved opiate completely.
So be it.

565
00:34:22,130 --> 00:34:26,120
You'd be welcome to have you don't have
a beard. You actually can't even go in.

566
00:34:26,190 --> 00:34:29,750
No, I don't care. They'll just tell
you why. What's wrong? Are you a woman?

567
00:34:30,380 --> 00:34:31,730
Are you a Jew?
Why?

568
00:34:32,060 --> 00:34:36,710
Because the reports saying that the
Jews that came to fight Mohammed had no

569
00:34:36,711 --> 00:34:40,940
beard design. It was a sign
of going to war and in Arabia,

570
00:34:41,210 --> 00:34:43,430
the sign of going toward
would be to shave your head.

571
00:34:43,910 --> 00:34:46,070
The Jews in Arabia would
shave their beards.

572
00:34:46,220 --> 00:34:51,000
So then you can tell who is who
in the backdrop. So Jesus, yes,

573
00:34:51,340 --> 00:34:56,060
slums kept their beards. Okay,
so it's not a credit. I mean,

574
00:34:56,061 --> 00:34:58,400
there are many reformers were don't
have beer. It's not a big deal.

575
00:34:58,940 --> 00:35:02,860
I grow this out. It's a week from
now. I say to you, let's get mom,

576
00:35:02,930 --> 00:35:07,340
get me to one of these masks. I want to
know what's going on. I walk in with you,

577
00:35:07,341 --> 00:35:11,040
let's say on a Friday prayer. Yeah,
we're just tell me what, what,

578
00:35:11,050 --> 00:35:16,050
what is actually being spoke of that
is the place from where it goes from in

579
00:35:18,110 --> 00:35:21,650
Islam as an ideology to a fundamentalist
ideology? Well, what are people hearing?

580
00:35:22,100 --> 00:35:24,710
Well firstly it depends on the speaker.
It depends on the MRI.

581
00:35:25,460 --> 00:35:30,460
There are Islamist in moms who say in
close circles what they will not say on

582
00:35:31,251 --> 00:35:34,070
the pulpits because of
the laws in the West.

583
00:35:34,520 --> 00:35:39,070
And then there are in moms who would go
on there and things nobody could have

584
00:35:39,090 --> 00:35:42,210
imagined would ever be set and the
history of Islam on the pulpit,

585
00:35:42,240 --> 00:35:43,950
they will just say it.
So there

586
00:35:44,050 --> 00:35:46,310
between the West and some of them,
they're doing this in though.

587
00:35:46,330 --> 00:35:50,020
I mean we see this out of Canada a lot,
just these incredibly,

588
00:35:50,290 --> 00:35:52,340
I'm awful things that
people that they're saying

589
00:35:52,370 --> 00:35:55,340
memory has a wonderful archive
of all of these issues.

590
00:35:55,550 --> 00:35:58,640
Youtube is another great source.
And the issue is they,

591
00:35:58,641 --> 00:36:02,600
the Mascaro records that your mom
and applauds it on. You've chipped.

592
00:36:02,601 --> 00:36:05,270
So it's nothing being discovered.
They,

593
00:36:05,720 --> 00:36:10,010
they know that the world is going to
react this way and they still continue to

594
00:36:10,011 --> 00:36:12,980
produce this content and now
they're speaking in English,

595
00:36:13,130 --> 00:36:17,700
which makes my job a lot easier because
I have to translate sometimes but now

596
00:36:17,730 --> 00:36:19,700
they were just saying it in English.

597
00:36:20,210 --> 00:36:23,710
Yes we want to be heard
and we want to conquer. And

598
00:36:23,840 --> 00:36:24,560
so when they're,

599
00:36:24,560 --> 00:36:27,950
when I see these videos and memory does
a great job of the translations when I

600
00:36:27,951 --> 00:36:28,790
see these videos,

601
00:36:28,791 --> 00:36:32,270
but let's say the new ones that aren't
translated from Canada for example,

602
00:36:32,630 --> 00:36:35,450
they want that message
to get out of the mosque.

603
00:36:35,451 --> 00:36:38,000
Like you would think that's
contrary to what they would want.

604
00:36:38,001 --> 00:36:41,390
You'd think it's like you'd want to keep
it sort of radicalized within so you

605
00:36:41,391 --> 00:36:43,070
can put a good face on things.

606
00:36:43,340 --> 00:36:46,250
But you're saying when they're talking
about this and now with the Jews and the

607
00:36:46,251 --> 00:36:49,610
gays and this and that and the other
thing you think they actually want that to

608
00:36:49,611 --> 00:36:51,020
get out there?
Cause they're the ones putting it out.

609
00:36:51,190 --> 00:36:51,640
Yes.

610
00:36:51,640 --> 00:36:56,470
And also there's a concept of the one
Muslim nation and it's called the Muslim

611
00:36:56,500 --> 00:36:59,890
Ummah Islam,
the Islamic nation.

612
00:37:00,640 --> 00:37:05,640
Now what it is is basically a Muslim
is a citizen of two or more nations.

613
00:37:07,300 --> 00:37:11,230
One of the nation, they live in America,

614
00:37:11,560 --> 00:37:14,140
Australia,
the UK,

615
00:37:14,470 --> 00:37:18,170
and the second one is the nation of Islam.
Not Farrakhan,

616
00:37:18,460 --> 00:37:20,110
but the actual Islamic nation.

617
00:37:20,710 --> 00:37:25,710
So if the mufti in Mecca issues affect
Wa and Islam are sitting in La would come

618
00:37:28,760 --> 00:37:31,200
in a terrorist attack. You
see that connection? Yeah.

619
00:37:31,510 --> 00:37:34,030
So when they were Salman
Rushdie's at Starbucks,

620
00:37:34,180 --> 00:37:37,660
yes you're on issues or
fatwah they'll get him here.

621
00:37:37,870 --> 00:37:42,870
There's a link and no other religion has
this power unless it's an organized a

622
00:37:43,150 --> 00:37:46,510
organization that targets
people in sense Hitman,

623
00:37:46,720 --> 00:37:48,730
but no other religion has this power.

624
00:37:48,940 --> 00:37:53,940
And in mom in Mecca would would say
that the Jews are the enemy or that the

625
00:37:55,240 --> 00:37:56,530
Christians are the enemy.

626
00:37:57,160 --> 00:38:02,160
Knowing 100% that they will be a Muslim
who would go and comment a terrorist

627
00:38:02,381 --> 00:38:06,100
attack. He doesn't even have to look
for him and doesn't need to do anything.

628
00:38:06,101 --> 00:38:09,580
He just knows the Muslim who will
get this and we'll do the job.

629
00:38:09,970 --> 00:38:14,170
Not other religion has this.
And we see it several times where the,

630
00:38:14,440 --> 00:38:17,520
in Russia they killed the a uh,

631
00:38:18,400 --> 00:38:20,770
I think it was a, sorry, in Turkey,

632
00:38:21,760 --> 00:38:25,070
I think it was a Russian ambassador
was shot dead. Oh yeah, yeah,

633
00:38:25,090 --> 00:38:27,640
there's video of it. Yeah. Just
right in the fight in the museum.

634
00:38:27,641 --> 00:38:30,400
There's nothing that was supposed to
protect him. And he said for Syria,

635
00:38:30,770 --> 00:38:35,770
and we see us every single month and
act doesn't go by without in the west,

636
00:38:36,550 --> 00:38:40,960
committing a terrorist attack and saying,
this is for Syria, this is for Iraq.

637
00:38:41,230 --> 00:38:45,190
What's that link? And this confuses
our intelligence departments.

638
00:38:45,580 --> 00:38:47,140
They've never seen anything like it.

639
00:38:47,230 --> 00:38:51,250
So when we're speaking about the
moms uploading videos online,

640
00:38:51,520 --> 00:38:54,940
they're actually contributing to
that platform of the Islamic nation.

641
00:38:55,240 --> 00:38:56,920
Whoever's out there.
This is our message.

642
00:38:57,030 --> 00:39:00,450
So I know you a free speech guy because
I see you tweeting about it all the time

643
00:39:00,451 --> 00:39:03,270
and then you're exercising. You are free
speech here. It's a beautiful thing.

644
00:39:04,020 --> 00:39:07,950
What should be done now? I
don't mean just from, you know,

645
00:39:08,010 --> 00:39:11,580
the inside conversation, say you
meeting with a a more fundamentalist,

646
00:39:11,581 --> 00:39:15,780
the mom and trying to, you
know, uh, get him back,

647
00:39:15,781 --> 00:39:17,250
let's say towards the center or something.

648
00:39:17,610 --> 00:39:20,190
But what should be done by these states?
What should Canada,

649
00:39:20,191 --> 00:39:21,420
what should the United States,

650
00:39:21,421 --> 00:39:24,880
what should Australia be doing
because they're using the,

651
00:39:24,881 --> 00:39:27,720
the freedoms of the West
against themselves. I mean,

652
00:39:27,721 --> 00:39:30,630
this is as difficult to free
speech topic as there is for the,

653
00:39:30,660 --> 00:39:32,340
for the true free speech people.
Yep.

654
00:39:32,450 --> 00:39:37,450
They're fighting for democratic rights
to be applied for the extremist,

655
00:39:38,301 --> 00:39:41,900
for the Islamist when their Islam is,
doesn't believe in democracy.

656
00:39:42,530 --> 00:39:46,800
They will use democracy to destroy
democracy and then establish their on a

657
00:39:46,860 --> 00:39:50,060
belief system. Now what
can we do? I think,

658
00:39:50,210 --> 00:39:52,320
and I say this all the time when,

659
00:39:52,330 --> 00:39:56,690
when I'm having dinner with a politician
or a premiere or you know, and I say,

660
00:39:56,750 --> 00:40:01,730
your political party is finished. You
guys are infiltrated. And if you email me,

661
00:40:01,731 --> 00:40:05,360
I'll send you reports about one or
two of your candidates and what their

662
00:40:05,361 --> 00:40:09,700
backgrounds are like.
And they remained spit just,

663
00:40:09,710 --> 00:40:12,560
and I'm not speaking in Liberal,
I'm speaking Conservative Party.

664
00:40:13,280 --> 00:40:17,120
I'm speaking parties who, you
know, we have hope in. Okay.

665
00:40:17,121 --> 00:40:19,810
These guys will seriously serve,
uh,

666
00:40:20,020 --> 00:40:25,020
the cause of national security will
tighten the situation at the borders more

667
00:40:25,131 --> 00:40:28,820
than let these jihad this come in, uh,
refugees who ended up being behind this,

668
00:40:28,821 --> 00:40:32,960
that we've had them in Australia.
So these guys are being infiltrated.

669
00:40:32,961 --> 00:40:34,240
So number one,
what we can.

670
00:40:34,360 --> 00:40:36,220
So what does that mean?
They're being infiltrated?

671
00:40:36,221 --> 00:40:39,730
Meaning meaning that there are actual
operatives within the political parties.

672
00:40:39,731 --> 00:40:40,030
I mean,

673
00:40:40,030 --> 00:40:44,500
I just had Brigitte Gabriel on who talks
a lot about the Muslim Brotherhood's

674
00:40:44,501 --> 00:40:47,170
long plan that this is an actual plan.

675
00:40:47,220 --> 00:40:48,020
Yes.
It's,

676
00:40:48,020 --> 00:40:53,020
it's one of the main plans to infiltrate
political parties and then make their

677
00:40:54,181 --> 00:40:57,930
way into positions where they
can change or make the law.

678
00:40:59,070 --> 00:41:02,160
And we've seen this numerous
times. I mean, my book,

679
00:41:02,161 --> 00:41:06,840
I speak about a lady deep,
I mean, uh, she became,

680
00:41:07,230 --> 00:41:09,150
well she's deceased now,
she passed away,

681
00:41:09,151 --> 00:41:14,151
but she wa she actually said that about
her long term goal is to make all of

682
00:41:14,431 --> 00:41:18,690
American Muslim and she was getting
grants from the American government.

683
00:41:18,900 --> 00:41:21,240
She was overseeing educational curriculums

684
00:41:21,450 --> 00:41:23,660
and, and you see this, I mean
even in the United States,

685
00:41:23,760 --> 00:41:26,900
and I'm not totally sure this is her
name, Alon Omar, is that her name?

686
00:41:26,901 --> 00:41:31,220
The representative in Minnesota
who just got elected and you know,

687
00:41:31,221 --> 00:41:34,000
should they found old tweets of hers
where she's saying, you know, uh,

688
00:41:34,070 --> 00:41:38,090
the Jews or Israel has pulled the wool
over something and all ask to take care

689
00:41:38,091 --> 00:41:42,050
of this. And then the entire time that
she was being elected, she kept saying,

690
00:41:42,051 --> 00:41:45,770
she's against boycotting Israel. The day
she gets elected and now she's for it.

691
00:41:46,010 --> 00:41:49,970
So, so this is not just pie in the
sky stuff that you're talking about.

692
00:41:51,120 --> 00:41:56,120
Everything you see in the Muslim world
when it comes to politics is all studied,

693
00:41:56,970 --> 00:42:01,650
is strategic. It's all planned,
well funded, well organized,

694
00:42:01,920 --> 00:42:04,410
and they know exactly what to do.
And when to do it.

695
00:42:05,220 --> 00:42:08,460
All the media that's going
on now against the, uh,

696
00:42:08,461 --> 00:42:10,830
the organizations such as care,

697
00:42:11,550 --> 00:42:13,650
they do no harm to care whatsoever.

698
00:42:14,070 --> 00:42:19,070
Care has a clear vision and they are
reaching their goals because there are

699
00:42:19,410 --> 00:42:23,610
loopholes and there are cracks within
the system and they're equivalent in

700
00:42:23,611 --> 00:42:28,140
Canada. They're equivalent in
Australia. And these, you know,

701
00:42:28,141 --> 00:42:32,670
these loopholes within the government
keep getting bigger and bigger as these

702
00:42:32,671 --> 00:42:37,230
guys get elected.
And I don't want to scare your viewers,

703
00:42:37,680 --> 00:42:40,950
but all I have to say is these
people are very smart people.

704
00:42:41,370 --> 00:42:46,370
They're not what the media says that
when they actually attack and then there

705
00:42:46,511 --> 00:42:50,160
are mentally ill or these people are,
are minorities,

706
00:42:50,340 --> 00:42:52,500
they're very strategic and they're very,
very smart,

707
00:42:52,530 --> 00:42:57,330
which is why intelligence services around
the world need hundreds of millions of

708
00:42:57,330 --> 00:42:59,670
dollars just to keep up with
what these guys are doing,

709
00:42:59,970 --> 00:43:04,680
that we need these resources to
understand how they operate and they keep

710
00:43:04,681 --> 00:43:07,520
learning and they're getting better
and better. What do you make of

711
00:43:07,540 --> 00:43:12,400
the, uh, the progressive
alliance seemingly with Islamist?

712
00:43:12,440 --> 00:43:16,120
I, I, to me, this is like
the biggest piece of this,

713
00:43:16,360 --> 00:43:17,850
that you've got certain pieces,

714
00:43:18,010 --> 00:43:21,460
pieces of the left that are just useless
idiots basically are, they're useful,

715
00:43:21,461 --> 00:43:22,630
idiot,
not useless.

716
00:43:22,631 --> 00:43:26,740
They're useful because they're allowing
these people to attain power in the name

717
00:43:26,741 --> 00:43:28,660
of tolerance. And it's like, well,

718
00:43:28,661 --> 00:43:31,180
you guys will just be the last
ones to be beheaded. I mean,

719
00:43:31,181 --> 00:43:33,040
that's really the way I
see this thing playing out.

720
00:43:34,180 --> 00:43:34,900
First,

721
00:43:34,900 --> 00:43:39,900
when I was in a fundamentalist Islamist,

722
00:43:40,690 --> 00:43:45,040
someone who rejected the West
rejected ballot with the West,

723
00:43:45,460 --> 00:43:49,510
my best friends from the outside world,

724
00:43:50,440 --> 00:43:54,850
you know, and I wouldn't say there were
friends who aren't your personally,

725
00:43:54,880 --> 00:43:58,360
but the people who I
considered our friends,

726
00:43:58,361 --> 00:44:00,550
our allies where the leftists.

727
00:44:01,570 --> 00:44:04,990
So when I was a fundamentalist
in mom's sitting in,

728
00:44:04,991 --> 00:44:09,370
in Iraq or Iran,
and I am on social media,

729
00:44:10,400 --> 00:44:13,090
there were certain people,
I liked politicians.

730
00:44:13,091 --> 00:44:17,950
I liked Jeremy Corbyn hero.
Uh, people like that. Yeah.

731
00:44:17,951 --> 00:44:20,080
Hillary Clinton,
every Muslim,

732
00:44:20,320 --> 00:44:24,580
every extremist Muslim in the United
States votes for Hillary Clinton.

733
00:44:25,210 --> 00:44:30,100
This is a fact. I'm not saying all of
them volts, but lords will do four vote.

734
00:44:30,101 --> 00:44:32,100
Hillary. There would
never republican. Right.

735
00:44:32,101 --> 00:44:35,810
So can you explain that connection
there? There's a common agenda. The edge.

736
00:44:35,860 --> 00:44:39,210
It's very common. I mean you take a
look at what these guys are doing.

737
00:44:40,120 --> 00:44:44,520
It's very common. Most extremist
Muslims just want to operate.

738
00:44:44,610 --> 00:44:48,930
Who's going to give them that free room
to breathe. They'll vote for that person.

739
00:44:49,410 --> 00:44:52,500
And Hillary and Obama, these
guys, they funded Isis,

740
00:44:52,980 --> 00:44:57,090
they funded isis and they funded
and with Jackie Dean, the jihadists,

741
00:44:57,450 --> 00:45:00,930
these rebels who killed my
family and these guys fund them.

742
00:45:01,470 --> 00:45:03,300
So the extremist at the end of the day,

743
00:45:03,301 --> 00:45:07,680
it's not seen as a threat by the
Democratic Party and they visit them every

744
00:45:07,681 --> 00:45:10,680
Ramadan and they sit with them
every Ramadan and they, you know,

745
00:45:10,681 --> 00:45:11,640
they welcome each other.

746
00:45:11,740 --> 00:45:14,410
So what do you think, okay,
so I'll go with you on that.

747
00:45:14,411 --> 00:45:18,760
But what do you think then is in the
mind of Hillary or Obama or any of these

748
00:45:18,761 --> 00:45:22,930
other lower level politicians that then
I would say again are useful idiots

749
00:45:22,931 --> 00:45:23,411
basically.

750
00:45:23,411 --> 00:45:28,150
They don't understand the threat that
you're laying out here are or do they,

751
00:45:28,250 --> 00:45:29,370
are they in that?
Like what?

752
00:45:29,371 --> 00:45:32,130
What do you think is actually going
on in the mind of Hillary when,

753
00:45:32,131 --> 00:45:33,310
when she's doing these things,

754
00:45:33,620 --> 00:45:35,530
and we don't even have to make
it about her specifically,

755
00:45:35,531 --> 00:45:36,400
but any of these people,

756
00:45:36,640 --> 00:45:39,970
she understands the threat and
so do many people like her.

757
00:45:40,030 --> 00:45:41,770
They know the threat
of what they're doing.

758
00:45:42,190 --> 00:45:45,640
I think they're just greedy because
they know they can't be touched,

759
00:45:46,120 --> 00:45:50,260
so she's protected. She doesn't
care about anybody else. It's greed,

760
00:45:50,460 --> 00:45:53,680
but pat protection doesn't always last.
Right. I mean this, this is a fool's game,

761
00:45:53,681 --> 00:45:54,240
right?

762
00:45:54,240 --> 00:45:55,680
It doesn't last,
but I mean,

763
00:45:55,860 --> 00:45:57,720
I think she's going to teach
for the rest of her life.

764
00:45:57,721 --> 00:46:00,360
She's going to have that protection
at least because you know, any Iraq,

765
00:46:00,361 --> 00:46:03,150
we had the same situation.
How did isis get in?

766
00:46:03,310 --> 00:46:07,950
Ice has gone into Iraq because certain
politicians plate the diversity game.

767
00:46:08,520 --> 00:46:12,600
You know, why have borders with
Saudi Arabia? Why have a wall,

768
00:46:13,320 --> 00:46:17,580
let the desert to be open and then these
cars came in from around the world and

769
00:46:17,581 --> 00:46:20,580
they took over 40 minutes
away from bad debt.

770
00:46:20,670 --> 00:46:24,930
I mean then politicians, when their
family members were being killed,

771
00:46:24,931 --> 00:46:29,730
they will up. So maybe that,
that's what it takes, that you,

772
00:46:29,970 --> 00:46:34,970
you experience the threat
of jihad personally.

773
00:46:35,640 --> 00:46:39,720
Then you'll understand where in Mankato
Hillary is coming from and people like

774
00:46:39,721 --> 00:46:43,450
Dave Rubin who understand what your mom
told he is saying maybe some people will

775
00:46:43,451 --> 00:46:46,920
wake up, but then again, that's
another world of politics.

776
00:46:47,640 --> 00:46:50,400
Let's talk about immigration a little
bit cause it's been sort of a thread

777
00:46:50,401 --> 00:46:55,230
through this. Um, your first
strong border protection,

778
00:46:55,460 --> 00:46:57,000
uh, I mentioned to you
right before we started,

779
00:46:57,001 --> 00:47:00,930
I was in London a couple months ago and
I hadn't been there for quite some time

780
00:47:00,931 --> 00:47:03,360
before that. I've been there twice this
year and the first time I was there,

781
00:47:03,690 --> 00:47:05,490
one of the things that was shocking to me,
it's just,

782
00:47:05,550 --> 00:47:09,000
it's just viscerally shocking and it has
nothing to do with bigotry or hatred or

783
00:47:09,001 --> 00:47:11,370
anything else is that I was in,
you know,

784
00:47:11,400 --> 00:47:15,240
the Harrods area right in the sort of
center of London and the amount of women

785
00:47:15,241 --> 00:47:18,390
that I saw in burqas. I mean
only eyes. That's it. Now,

786
00:47:18,391 --> 00:47:22,620
I have no problem with those
people individually of course,

787
00:47:22,950 --> 00:47:24,940
but seeing this amount,
I mean I'm talking,

788
00:47:25,020 --> 00:47:28,860
it seemed like at points 20 or
30% of the women now, if they, if,

789
00:47:28,930 --> 00:47:32,870
if I had seen 30% of the women dressed
in traditional Mormon clothing or dressed

790
00:47:32,871 --> 00:47:33,611
as orthodox Jews,

791
00:47:33,611 --> 00:47:36,280
I would have also thought there's
something strange going on here.

792
00:47:36,281 --> 00:47:37,640
Let's put it that way.
That's what I do.

793
00:47:37,650 --> 00:47:40,570
It's just like this
something odd going on here.

794
00:47:40,571 --> 00:47:44,710
Can you just talk about that related to
Western countries and then how that's

795
00:47:44,740 --> 00:47:47,140
related to immigration?
Very simple.

796
00:47:47,650 --> 00:47:49,720
You see how I had to even ask the
question in a way that's like,

797
00:47:49,721 --> 00:47:52,960
I'm apologizing for seeing something.
It's like it's pathetic.

798
00:47:52,990 --> 00:47:57,790
Yeah. Uh, it's very simple. The West
has become weaker. They become stronger.

799
00:47:58,690 --> 00:48:02,020
They're telling you this is the norm.
In fact, this is the college norm.

800
00:48:02,050 --> 00:48:03,190
This is how we're going to address.

801
00:48:03,191 --> 00:48:05,560
You're going to look at us and you're
going to turn away if you're not like it.

802
00:48:05,890 --> 00:48:10,780
That's basically it. That's
what's happening now. Are
these people extremists?

803
00:48:10,990 --> 00:48:11,823
Of course.

804
00:48:12,160 --> 00:48:16,660
I'm not saying every lady that
always a burger is an extremist.

805
00:48:17,020 --> 00:48:22,020
What I'm saying is because you
know this is between us on camera.

806
00:48:22,781 --> 00:48:27,580
Yeah, don't worry, it's just
going to youtube. So you know,

807
00:48:27,730 --> 00:48:32,530
some of the filthiest woman to ever
exist are ones that were burgers,

808
00:48:33,340 --> 00:48:35,890
seriously hookers.
Uh,

809
00:48:35,920 --> 00:48:40,900
they were brokers because they don't
want them their faces to be not. And uh,

810
00:48:40,930 --> 00:48:45,580
you know, now in Baghdad from the
reports that come, because you know,

811
00:48:45,581 --> 00:48:46,720
I speak to officials,

812
00:48:47,080 --> 00:48:52,000
they tell us that they have a problem
with prostitution and the woman are

813
00:48:52,001 --> 00:48:56,410
wearing burgers and they want to stand
out from the other women that are wearing

814
00:48:56,411 --> 00:49:01,000
burkas. So what they do is they flip their
attire inside out, but it's all black.

815
00:49:01,030 --> 00:49:04,330
But all you have to do is focus on
that thread. Is that inside out?

816
00:49:04,610 --> 00:49:09,010
Ah, so an inside out
burger and fries to three,

817
00:49:09,100 --> 00:49:12,910
exactly in Baghdad and some air,
some Muslim areas.

818
00:49:13,510 --> 00:49:17,230
If a lady went in there with a burger,
they know she's up to something.

819
00:49:17,980 --> 00:49:22,510
So this isn't Islamophobia,
this is Muslim areas or what's,

820
00:49:22,540 --> 00:49:25,960
what's she up to? So
it's none of that. Oh,

821
00:49:25,961 --> 00:49:27,690
I wear it to preserve my modesty.

822
00:49:27,700 --> 00:49:30,760
No one's going to hit on me or on the
street and cat calling. No. In fact,

823
00:49:30,761 --> 00:49:35,650
some guys got there just to look for these
women because they know she's out for

824
00:49:35,651 --> 00:49:37,780
business. Yeah. No, not all of them,

825
00:49:37,810 --> 00:49:42,810
but this does exist for the women
who live in the West who web workers.

826
00:49:45,160 --> 00:49:48,430
There are several types of women.
One,

827
00:49:48,610 --> 00:49:52,690
one that's forced by her husband.
The second one,

828
00:49:52,930 --> 00:49:56,410
the second type is the type that would
divorce her husband if he told her to

829
00:49:56,411 --> 00:50:01,411
take it off and the third one would be
someone who is just trying to fit in with

830
00:50:02,891 --> 00:50:05,800
all of this.
We are the rebels in society.

831
00:50:06,250 --> 00:50:10,510
We are the real Muslims.
That's basically my analysis of the city.

832
00:50:10,750 --> 00:50:11,583
Yeah.

833
00:50:12,160 --> 00:50:17,160
Do the average leftie that used to be
your ally when you were more extreme,

834
00:50:17,561 --> 00:50:18,394
so to speak,

835
00:50:18,400 --> 00:50:23,400
do you think they realize that this set
of ideas is so in direct conflict with

836
00:50:24,641 --> 00:50:27,800
the rest of their ideas, their
rest of their ideas, tolerance,

837
00:50:27,801 --> 00:50:31,490
and we're for gays and minorities and
women and all of these things that they've

838
00:50:31,491 --> 00:50:33,530
aligned themselves with
it with an ideology.

839
00:50:33,531 --> 00:50:34,970
If you were to look at
it in their pyramid,

840
00:50:35,150 --> 00:50:38,630
they've put Islam really at the top of
their pyramid because they believe it's a

841
00:50:38,631 --> 00:50:40,070
brown person's religion,

842
00:50:40,370 --> 00:50:44,830
which of course is is a racist notion
in itself because a religion is not of a

843
00:50:44,910 --> 00:50:46,670
skin color.
Um,

844
00:50:46,700 --> 00:50:49,730
but do you think they even realize
like now I'm not talking about say the

845
00:50:49,731 --> 00:50:52,580
Islamist, what they realize their
alliance is the other way around.

846
00:50:52,820 --> 00:50:55,100
Do you think these people have
any sense of what's going on here?

847
00:50:55,850 --> 00:51:00,850
I think what's happening now is that
loyalty has shifted from being loyal to

848
00:51:01,041 --> 00:51:05,660
your country and to your people, to being
loyal to your boss and to your company.

849
00:51:06,770 --> 00:51:11,300
So I've seen generalists who would
write wonderful articles about me.

850
00:51:11,420 --> 00:51:15,290
The moment they get a job
and a left leaning outlets,

851
00:51:15,860 --> 00:51:19,250
it's like I'm a whore. I'm the worst
person that they've ever known.

852
00:51:19,490 --> 00:51:22,490
And the contradiction remains
online. Like what happened here? I'm,

853
00:51:22,670 --> 00:51:27,380
I'm someone who is going to influence
the Australia and I'm a peaceful guy and

854
00:51:27,381 --> 00:51:31,500
they welcome me and here I am
a fraud who should be silenced.

855
00:51:31,501 --> 00:51:35,920
Don't give him the megaphone. So you
see, I think a loyalty falls in, uh,

856
00:51:36,080 --> 00:51:39,260
companies, uh, no more in,

857
00:51:40,040 --> 00:51:42,470
in country or faith or family.

858
00:51:42,580 --> 00:51:43,000
Yeah.

859
00:51:43,000 --> 00:51:46,960
Can you talk a little bit about the sort
of unique way that Islam is designed to

860
00:51:46,961 --> 00:51:48,410
spread?
So already,

861
00:51:48,530 --> 00:51:51,870
are you familiar with Dr Bill
Warner who does political islam.com?

862
00:51:51,871 --> 00:51:54,010
So one of the things that
he said when I had him on,

863
00:51:54,011 --> 00:51:57,280
I think this is probably over three years
ago, that I thought it was interesting.

864
00:51:57,281 --> 00:52:00,310
He said that religions are
designed to spread differently.

865
00:52:00,311 --> 00:52:03,520
So Judaism for example,
it's very hard to convert.

866
00:52:03,521 --> 00:52:05,710
You have to do a lot to convert.
But if you want to get out,

867
00:52:05,950 --> 00:52:08,440
you just basically say, I'm not a
Jew. Every Jew would be like, ah,

868
00:52:08,441 --> 00:52:12,670
you're still a Jew. And then that's it.
Where Islam, it's very easy to get in,

869
00:52:12,671 --> 00:52:12,821
right?

870
00:52:12,821 --> 00:52:16,630
You just have to recite something very
quickly and it's almost impossible to get

871
00:52:16,631 --> 00:52:20,320
out because then you're an apostate,
so now we can, we can kill you.

872
00:52:20,321 --> 00:52:22,420
So he said it's actually a virus is,

873
00:52:22,630 --> 00:52:26,170
is very easy to attain and
very difficult to eliminate.

874
00:52:26,350 --> 00:52:29,740
So that's what he was comparing it to.
I thought it was an interesting analogy.

875
00:52:29,950 --> 00:52:33,220
Okay. Um, for me personally,

876
00:52:33,670 --> 00:52:37,030
the way I see it is if Islam was going
to grow in Huston row in the right

877
00:52:37,031 --> 00:52:37,864
direction,

878
00:52:37,900 --> 00:52:41,710
because I believe Muslims will always
be converting people and there'll be,

879
00:52:41,711 --> 00:52:43,540
people always come back to Islam.

880
00:52:43,840 --> 00:52:48,670
So I don't believe religion can be
stopped at all or eliminated. I mean,

881
00:52:48,680 --> 00:52:49,540
look at Judaism,

882
00:52:50,160 --> 00:52:53,320
they never had a government to protect
them for thousands and thousands of years.

883
00:52:54,010 --> 00:52:57,010
Everyone was trying to kill
them and did in fact kill them.

884
00:52:57,011 --> 00:53:01,390
They've been butchered in the millions,
but they still, they're still around.

885
00:53:01,480 --> 00:53:05,620
It's hard. It's not hard. It's almost
impossible to eradicate a religion.

886
00:53:06,040 --> 00:53:10,030
It doesn't work like that. Uh,
so that's my take my position.

887
00:53:10,031 --> 00:53:11,620
So I don't see it as a virus.

888
00:53:12,040 --> 00:53:16,660
I just believe people will always have
certain opinions and and change religions.

889
00:53:17,140 --> 00:53:22,140
What I do acknowledge is the fact that
Islam is very strategic in recruiting

890
00:53:22,930 --> 00:53:25,030
adherence to its belief system.

891
00:53:25,650 --> 00:53:30,570
And this isn't all Islamic schools
of thought, but the majority of them,

892
00:53:31,140 --> 00:53:35,550
so the majority of mainstream do actually
have a strategy and it's called throw

893
00:53:35,551 --> 00:53:36,870
down that way.

894
00:53:37,200 --> 00:53:41,340
What does it is they go out to the
streets and there are basically selling

895
00:53:41,341 --> 00:53:45,030
religion. There was solid religion
and in return they'll give you heaven,

896
00:53:45,390 --> 00:53:49,410
a paradise in the hereafter.
That's the basic transaction.

897
00:53:50,040 --> 00:53:52,380
And you know there's an
audience for everything.

898
00:53:52,440 --> 00:53:57,240
This is a fact and many people do embrace
Islam because of the promises that

899
00:53:57,241 --> 00:53:57,601
they get.

900
00:53:57,601 --> 00:54:01,650
I mean if you're a businessman and
you're stopped by one of these stalls and

901
00:54:01,651 --> 00:54:05,610
they'll tell you there's so much
wealth waiting for you, one prayer,

902
00:54:05,611 --> 00:54:10,020
we'll build your five castles.
If you're a farmer, they'll tell,

903
00:54:10,050 --> 00:54:13,350
they'll promise you massive farms in,
in paradise.

904
00:54:13,770 --> 00:54:17,580
If they know that you're like women,
they'll promise you plenty of women.

905
00:54:17,580 --> 00:54:21,360
Like the Jihad is 72 virgin issue. Let's
see. Two virgins seems like a bit much.

906
00:54:22,680 --> 00:54:23,513
No,

907
00:54:23,760 --> 00:54:28,760
the actual teaching say each one of
these 72 virgins comes with her aids.

908
00:54:30,960 --> 00:54:32,280
So it's actually more than 72.

909
00:54:32,820 --> 00:54:37,820
And the actual number 72 or 70 in
the Arabic language just means a lot.

910
00:54:38,730 --> 00:54:41,460
It means unlimited PTO is right.
I've told you a million times.

911
00:54:42,770 --> 00:54:47,070
That's good to know. So
it's not actually 72. Um,

912
00:54:47,400 --> 00:54:48,630
and it's not raisins either.

913
00:54:49,080 --> 00:54:53,880
Maybe people say it's not because the
Islamic books describe their hair,

914
00:54:54,140 --> 00:54:57,990
their eyes. And if one hair
wants to fall on planet earth,

915
00:54:58,050 --> 00:55:00,780
the perfume would be smarter by everyone.

916
00:55:00,781 --> 00:55:03,720
So there are descriptions that
these actual women non reasons.

917
00:55:04,530 --> 00:55:09,530
So the strategy of Islam spreading is
very unique in a sense that their unity,

918
00:55:11,710 --> 00:55:16,680
uh, in, in their urology is
unbreakable. It's impossible. I mean,

919
00:55:17,160 --> 00:55:22,080
I'm Muslim would unite with a Muslim,
against a Christian, against an atheist,

920
00:55:22,290 --> 00:55:26,370
even if he knows his brother and faith
is wrong. So then how are you a Muslim?

921
00:55:27,270 --> 00:55:31,650
And that's the thing. When you ask him,
are Shia Muslims Muslim? They'll say, no,

922
00:55:31,980 --> 00:55:35,490
you asked the Shia and the Sunni
Muslim, they'll say, not real Muslims.

923
00:55:35,970 --> 00:55:39,150
Then that Hamodia will say,
both of these guys are not Muslim.

924
00:55:39,600 --> 00:55:40,500
I'm the real Muslim.

925
00:55:41,070 --> 00:55:44,070
And then bought the she and the suddenly
all the United against that at the and

926
00:55:44,071 --> 00:55:48,750
say, here's what the real Muslim, so
it's a struggle within Islam itself.

927
00:55:48,780 --> 00:55:53,520
It's a problem. And they fall into
many contradictions because of this,

928
00:55:53,521 --> 00:55:57,660
because Muslims killing Muslims everyday
Muslim governments bombing all Muslim

929
00:55:57,661 --> 00:55:58,494
governments,

930
00:55:59,000 --> 00:56:01,370
right? I mean what's going on with Saudi
Arabia in Yemen, right? Yeah, yeah.

931
00:56:01,371 --> 00:56:02,600
Which nobody talks about of course,

932
00:56:02,601 --> 00:56:04,310
because we don't know
how to frame it properly.

933
00:56:04,370 --> 00:56:07,280
So we just wait for something
to happen with Israel basically.

934
00:56:07,281 --> 00:56:10,250
And then it's like, oh well now we can,
we got good guys and bad guys. It's easy.

935
00:56:10,251 --> 00:56:14,000
So all right. So two more questions
for you. So one, where do you,

936
00:56:14,120 --> 00:56:15,920
what do you think it is about you?

937
00:56:16,310 --> 00:56:19,730
About the guy I'm sitting across from
him right now that gives you the sort of

938
00:56:19,731 --> 00:56:22,070
bravery to talk about
this. This is, this is,

939
00:56:22,190 --> 00:56:24,520
I mean that's why when first came
on the scene and everyone was like,

940
00:56:24,521 --> 00:56:28,330
talk to this guy, I was hesitant
because I was like, I just,

941
00:56:28,510 --> 00:56:32,140
I just don't know enough that I had a,
I don't want the wool pulled over my eyes,

942
00:56:32,141 --> 00:56:36,430
but be, you know, as your critics will
say, there's fame to gain out of this.

943
00:56:36,431 --> 00:56:39,920
There is all of this other,
a bounty to be habit.

944
00:56:40,130 --> 00:56:43,030
So what is it about you
that makes you do this?

945
00:56:44,100 --> 00:56:48,690
I'm nobody special.
I swear I'm nobody special.

946
00:56:48,691 --> 00:56:51,900
I'm just a regular guy who
grew up in almost a family,

947
00:56:52,530 --> 00:56:55,560
was trained in Iran,
um,

948
00:56:55,710 --> 00:56:58,980
life put me in this position
or they end as a scholar,

949
00:56:59,550 --> 00:57:03,750
came back to Australia,
started meeting with politicians.

950
00:57:04,620 --> 00:57:07,350
It worked out really well.
More politicians started inviting me.

951
00:57:07,650 --> 00:57:10,910
We started working with parliaments,
advising senates,

952
00:57:11,460 --> 00:57:14,070
and I have a Twitter
account that I'm active on.

953
00:57:14,130 --> 00:57:17,160
I have a foundation and organization,
basic stuff.

954
00:57:17,790 --> 00:57:22,790
And I speak out only because I've always
been outspoken about it when I was in

955
00:57:23,071 --> 00:57:26,220
Islam as I was an outspoken Islam.
So let's put it that way.

956
00:57:26,221 --> 00:57:30,990
Going out smoking Islam. This sound like
you don't want to hear it. It's horrible.

957
00:57:31,380 --> 00:57:34,290
I was outspoken.
I used to flagellate.

958
00:57:35,250 --> 00:57:37,770
I don't know if you've seen
my pictures now, but you,

959
00:57:37,771 --> 00:57:42,510
so you actually used to do it. Yeah.
Wait, can you explain what that is?

960
00:57:42,810 --> 00:57:44,760
I would cover myself in my own blood.

961
00:57:46,270 --> 00:57:49,960
Absolute flagellation so you know I'm,
I'm,

962
00:57:50,000 --> 00:57:51,930
I'm not a convert into the religion.

963
00:57:53,190 --> 00:57:56,660
I've come from that whole lineage
and lifestyle. You got credit,

964
00:57:57,840 --> 00:58:02,840
but people usually ask me what red
pilled you and because this is politics,

965
00:58:03,511 --> 00:58:06,390
this is religion.
I just don't know how to answer that.

966
00:58:06,780 --> 00:58:11,780
But I think the best way to put it is
that I have always been outspoken and I'm

967
00:58:14,191 --> 00:58:16,530
not afraid.
In fact,

968
00:58:16,860 --> 00:58:21,860
I am afraid of the fact that I'm not
afraid because I can get myself into

969
00:58:21,901 --> 00:58:22,830
serious trouble.

970
00:58:23,220 --> 00:58:27,000
I've said certain things in front of
certain people that I've had to leave the

971
00:58:27,001 --> 00:58:28,140
country at the same afternoon.

972
00:58:28,190 --> 00:58:32,660
Yeah. Well your, your Twitter, Twitter,
bio used to be something to the,

973
00:58:32,970 --> 00:58:35,020
do you know what exactly it is?
Where I want to today.

974
00:58:35,200 --> 00:58:37,510
One day you will hear that.

975
00:58:37,690 --> 00:58:41,260
I have been killed and the
news will speak about it.

976
00:58:41,800 --> 00:58:46,750
That was my first Twitter bio and then
I changed it simply because I had a

977
00:58:46,751 --> 00:58:50,020
meeting with state intelligence
and they said, you know what,

978
00:58:50,470 --> 00:58:54,730
you could be giving ideas to
certain people, so remove it.

979
00:58:54,731 --> 00:58:58,440
So I put peace advocate, things like
that. But I do have a, you know,

980
00:58:58,460 --> 00:59:02,050
a great security team and
I'm very grateful for.

981
00:59:02,230 --> 00:59:04,690
Yeah. All right. So my
last question is this.

982
00:59:05,590 --> 00:59:10,380
Paint me two roads of the future. Give
me two pictures of the future, Hawaii,

983
00:59:10,450 --> 00:59:15,450
the the future that you want to
build and then I want the future.

984
00:59:15,761 --> 00:59:17,860
If that does not get built,
what does that look like?

985
00:59:17,861 --> 00:59:19,210
So you can do either one first.

986
00:59:19,640 --> 00:59:23,660
The future, I want to focuses
on the west and the West alone.

987
00:59:24,080 --> 00:59:29,080
The Middle East isn't in my area anymore
because me having this interview,

988
00:59:30,410 --> 00:59:34,340
something like this in the Middle East
would see me killed the same week.

989
00:59:35,060 --> 00:59:39,770
So the best way to reach the Middle
East is through social media.

990
00:59:40,190 --> 00:59:42,680
And I've got my accounts and Arabic,
I've got a counseling,

991
00:59:42,681 --> 00:59:45,530
different languages where I have
translators that do that for me.

992
00:59:46,190 --> 00:59:51,190
But my main vision and my effort and
energy goes into the west and I would like

993
00:59:57,831 --> 01:00:02,831
to see all Islamist
extremist centers shut down.

994
01:00:04,480 --> 01:00:08,840
Uh, the people who are fundamentalists
and have been sponsored by terrorist

995
01:00:08,841 --> 01:00:13,640
organizations such as care to lose
their positions in government.

996
01:00:14,810 --> 01:00:19,810
I would like to see a honorable leader
of a country that cracks down on these

997
01:00:21,501 --> 01:00:24,380
extremists.
On the other hand,

998
01:00:24,410 --> 01:00:29,410
I would like to see the so
called moderates or just
the regular Muslims speaking

999
01:00:32,151 --> 01:00:37,151
out more and they're in moms being more
vocal against the extremists and have

1000
01:00:39,140 --> 01:00:43,640
this unity as a society.
You could be Jewish,

1001
01:00:43,910 --> 01:00:44,840
I could be Muslim,

1002
01:00:45,590 --> 01:00:48,770
our friend could be Christian and we
could just sit down and have a meal

1003
01:00:48,771 --> 01:00:53,350
together, shake hands, go
to, you know, a, a match,

1004
01:00:53,400 --> 01:00:54,950
watch a match together.
Watch a movie.

1005
01:00:55,190 --> 01:00:58,110
No problem in that which people are
doing every day in the west. Yes.

1006
01:00:58,270 --> 01:01:02,870
We shouldn't forget that we are
doing that. So after this interview,

1007
01:01:03,080 --> 01:01:06,950
I'll go back to Australia and I
go back into the Muslim community.

1008
01:01:07,820 --> 01:01:10,820
I don't go back to meeting
with Jews and Christians.

1009
01:01:10,821 --> 01:01:13,670
I do that in my interfaith work,

1010
01:01:14,120 --> 01:01:17,000
but I actually live amongst
the Muslim community.

1011
01:01:17,240 --> 01:01:22,240
So I would like to see that
Muslim community embracing
the larger community in

1012
01:01:22,461 --> 01:01:24,610
the West.
That's uh,

1013
01:01:25,010 --> 01:01:29,960
my vision because then we can work on
establishing peace and building a better

1014
01:01:29,961 --> 01:01:33,650
relations and basically uniting with w
with the rest of the world against the

1015
01:01:33,651 --> 01:01:37,760
extremists, within our own
religion. That's my vision.
If that doesn't work out,

1016
01:01:37,790 --> 01:01:40,010
I was going to say we should have done
this and the other way because now you're

1017
01:01:40,011 --> 01:01:42,220
going to end up ending on,
on the bad notes.

1018
01:01:42,221 --> 01:01:45,560
So I'll try to figure out a way to
get us the thumbnail offending is.

1019
01:01:45,950 --> 01:01:47,360
If that doesn't work out,

1020
01:01:47,810 --> 01:01:52,810
then I believe we have to unite as a,

1021
01:01:53,900 --> 01:01:58,900
because there will always be
Muslims or have conservative views.

1022
01:01:59,930 --> 01:02:02,240
Do you know how many Muslims
about for Trump? Many.

1023
01:02:02,660 --> 01:02:06,470
They flit from the rulers who
Trump is now putting in line.

1024
01:02:07,070 --> 01:02:11,360
So they would vote for Trump just for
that very reason that they know that

1025
01:02:11,361 --> 01:02:16,361
they're all as back home can start war
with other countries who are allies with

1026
01:02:17,721 --> 01:02:20,670
America. So many Muslims
vote for Trump. Well that,

1027
01:02:20,671 --> 01:02:24,090
that also is the ultimate irony of the
alliance with the left because it's like

1028
01:02:24,091 --> 01:02:27,030
you're taking a group of people
who are inherently conservative,

1029
01:02:27,031 --> 01:02:32,031
who old conservative religious values
and then your aligning them with people

1030
01:02:32,191 --> 01:02:35,940
that hold none of those values and
they're going, please join us for now.

1031
01:02:36,900 --> 01:02:41,900
I think if my vision of the West
doesn't end up being successful,

1032
01:02:42,930 --> 01:02:47,180
then we need to unite as the,
uh,

1033
01:02:47,580 --> 01:02:52,580
the revisionists reformist Muslims who
are completely against what's happening

1034
01:02:54,980 --> 01:02:58,290
unite with the Jews,
with the Christians.

1035
01:02:58,650 --> 01:03:03,650
Let's put far left far right aside
and let's just speak as humans who are

1036
01:03:03,980 --> 01:03:07,860
concerned about national security,
we need to unite on a professional level.

1037
01:03:07,890 --> 01:03:12,540
It's not enough to speak on youtube and,
and to tweet. This isn't enough for me,

1038
01:03:12,600 --> 01:03:16,200
which is why I go and I sit
with politicians because
I want to get something

1039
01:03:16,201 --> 01:03:20,990
done. So we need tonight,
either now or unite in, in a,

1040
01:03:20,991 --> 01:03:25,991
in a much more global style in the
future to end on a positive note.

1041
01:03:27,060 --> 01:03:27,960
I'll tell you this,

1042
01:03:29,550 --> 01:03:34,550
the Islamists are worried now may be not
showing it too much because they were

1043
01:03:35,961 --> 01:03:38,700
getting people into Congress
and people into parliaments,

1044
01:03:39,000 --> 01:03:41,940
but then are worried they've
lost a lot of territory.

1045
01:03:42,570 --> 01:03:47,520
The caliphate that they dreamed of, they
have lost Isis and they've lost a lot.

1046
01:03:47,521 --> 01:03:51,600
I mean the United Arab Emirates
shutting them down, uh,

1047
01:03:51,630 --> 01:03:56,630
Austria shut down 60 deported
60 months back to Turkey.

1048
01:03:58,230 --> 01:04:03,230
I mean we are doing things
that harm them and harm their,

1049
01:04:03,750 --> 01:04:06,090
you know, their, their
agenda of death basically.

1050
01:04:06,780 --> 01:04:10,260
And we're doing them in large portion,

1051
01:04:10,261 --> 01:04:15,261
so in portions they can't accept 16 months
vanished from the country in one day.

1052
01:04:16,530 --> 01:04:20,640
That's a big loss for them.
Yeah. So we are pushing back,

1053
01:04:20,670 --> 01:04:21,880
I believe as a,

1054
01:04:21,881 --> 01:04:26,770
as a society or as a global
society against the extremists. Uh,

1055
01:04:26,790 --> 01:04:31,790
but I think it's a slow way
to the finishing point and
we will win at the end of

1056
01:04:32,340 --> 01:04:32,341
the day.

1057
01:04:32,341 --> 01:04:36,990
I do know that eventually people will
just get fed up with the extremists and

1058
01:04:36,991 --> 01:04:41,490
unite with these reformers and
just get them out of the society.

1059
01:04:41,491 --> 01:04:43,410
I don't know how. Maybe in a
hundred years, I don't know,

1060
01:04:43,650 --> 01:04:47,040
but it's going to be really bad.
The way we win. We'll be really bad.

1061
01:04:47,041 --> 01:04:48,290
That one might be peaceful and it's,

1062
01:04:48,430 --> 01:04:53,070
I really hope that we can pave the
way for a much more peaceful ending,

1063
01:04:53,580 --> 01:04:57,750
but I'll just say this. Every time
I came on Australian television,

1064
01:04:58,620 --> 01:05:01,840
I have a police officer that time
that tells me, you're not your mom.

1065
01:05:02,370 --> 01:05:04,950
I've been testing this every
time you go out there speaking,

1066
01:05:05,310 --> 01:05:10,310
we get more applications for firearms
because they believe Marine invasion is

1067
01:05:11,341 --> 01:05:15,120
coming. So then I started to
tone it down a little bit. Yeah,

1068
01:05:15,390 --> 01:05:18,020
but I still want to say
the truth and I wish for

1069
01:05:18,020 --> 01:05:19,320
a peaceful ending.
That's basically it.

1070
01:05:19,390 --> 01:05:22,090
Isn't it weird how you just have to
live your life and do what you think is

1071
01:05:22,091 --> 01:05:23,140
right at all times?

1072
01:05:23,141 --> 01:05:26,050
I remember when I first started talking
about this stuff and I was just a little

1073
01:05:26,051 --> 01:05:30,030
worried about security and things. I
said to, do you know Dennis Prager? Yes.

1074
01:05:30,160 --> 01:05:33,130
I said to Dennis Prager. I asked him
about just security cause it just,

1075
01:05:33,131 --> 01:05:35,380
any of any of my friends in this world,
they're talking about this stuff.

1076
01:05:35,381 --> 01:05:38,860
I was just asking and I said
to Dennis, uh, you know,

1077
01:05:38,861 --> 01:05:41,230
what do you do about security? And he
told me some things that I can't repeat,

1078
01:05:41,231 --> 01:05:44,410
but then he goes, but at the end of
the day when it's your time to go,

1079
01:05:44,440 --> 01:05:47,740
it's your time to go. I thought,
well, I'm a little younger than you.

1080
01:05:47,741 --> 01:05:52,390
I'm not quite ready for that yet. Well
listen, you have an ally in me and I hope,

1081
01:05:52,420 --> 01:05:53,400
I hope,
I hope we,

1082
01:05:53,440 --> 01:05:57,940
I hope we helped spread a little bit of
what I know you've made your life about.

1083
01:05:57,941 --> 01:05:59,650
And uh,
you know,

1084
01:05:59,651 --> 01:06:02,260
hopefully there's a way that it doesn't
get that bad before it gets better.

1085
01:06:02,261 --> 01:06:05,790
I suppose. We shall see. Definitely.
Thank you so much for having me. Yeah.

1086
01:06:05,800 --> 01:06:08,110
And I'm sorry we can't hang out
tonight cause I would've loved to,

1087
01:06:08,111 --> 01:06:11,740
but I'm a little crazy at the moment.
And for more on a mom to Iti,

1088
01:06:11,770 --> 01:06:16,300
follow him on Twitter before
he's banned at eamomm of peace.
