The Do's Of Assisting With Panic Attacks

00:00:14.935 --> 00:00:15.535
The Do's Of Assisting With Panic Attacks

00:00:15.540 --> 00:00:18.475
A panic attack is a sudden urge of overwhelming anxiety and fear

00:00:18.480 --> 00:00:21.840
That can occur anywhere at any time

00:00:21.840 --> 00:00:24.700
If ever observing someone experiencing an attack

00:00:24.705 --> 00:00:27.520
Do not panic, the person suffering

00:00:27.525 --> 00:00:30.575
the panic attack does not need the extra stress of

00:00:30.575 --> 00:00:33.705
someone else panicking and screaming at them. Instead there are some

00:00:33.705 --> 00:00:36.560
Helpful ways to assist someone through a panic attack.

00:00:37.380 --> 00:00:40.480
If it is the first time the individual is experiencing this

00:00:40.480 --> 00:00:42.160
Seek medical attention.

00:00:42.160 --> 00:00:43.300
Having a panic attack

00:00:43.300 --> 00:00:46.375
Can be overwhelming enough, but experiencing it for the first time

00:00:46.380 --> 00:00:48.760
Makes it even more stressful.

00:00:48.760 --> 00:00:51.920
Especially if the individual doesn't know what's going on.

00:00:51.920 --> 00:00:54.680
Although a panic attack is non life threatening on it's own

00:00:54.685 --> 00:00:57.695
It's best to call for emergency medical attention if in doubt.

00:00:57.695 --> 00:01:00.815
This is especially important if the person has asthma,

00:01:00.820 --> 00:01:03.280
diabetes or other medical conditions.

00:01:03.460 --> 00:01:06.060
Ensure the individual experiencing the attack is breathing

00:01:06.060 --> 00:01:07.300
Ensure the individual experiencing the attack is breathing

00:01:07.615 --> 00:01:10.585
If the individual is standing or leaning

00:01:10.585 --> 00:01:13.565
against an object, it's best that they sit down.

00:01:13.565 --> 00:01:16.855
This will make breathing easier and insure minimal harm if they faint.

00:01:17.335 --> 00:01:20.295
The person may remain unresponsive or hyperventilate too quickly

00:01:20.295 --> 00:01:23.135
And fall unconscious. If this is the case,

00:01:23.135 --> 00:01:25.865
Lay them down, listen to their breathing, and check their pulse.

00:01:25.865 --> 00:01:28.555
check their pulse. The average adult heart beats 60 times per minute

00:01:28.560 --> 00:01:31.465
The average adult heart beats 60 time per minute so try to keep track of the clock

00:01:31.465 --> 00:01:34.040
As you take their pulse. If their hyperventilating

00:01:34.040 --> 00:01:37.140
or breathing too quickly, ask the individual to take

00:01:37.140 --> 00:01:39.595
a breath with every other number you say and begin counting to 10.

00:01:39.595 --> 00:01:40.805
counting to 10

00:01:41.195 --> 00:01:43.905
start counting at a slightly sped up pace

00:01:43.905 --> 00:01:46.855
but as their rate of breathing falls decrease their speed of counting

00:01:46.860 --> 00:01:50.105
until the individual is breathing at a regular pace.

00:01:50.105 --> 00:01:53.040
If their not breathing at all, calmly ask them

00:01:53.045 --> 00:01:56.120
to attempt to take a single breath.

00:01:56.125 --> 00:01:59.025
This request may have to be repeated several times, and once they respond

00:01:59.025 --> 00:02:02.065
continue to make this request.

00:02:02.065 --> 00:02:03.985
The goal is to have the person breathing on their own.

00:02:04.875 --> 00:02:07.425
Ask grounding questions.

00:02:07.765 --> 00:02:10.545
This is a frightening time for the individual

00:02:10.545 --> 00:02:13.425
experiencing the attack, and confusion can often come with the panic

00:02:13.425 --> 00:02:16.840
Asking simple questions can help ground them.

00:02:16.880 --> 00:02:19.940
Grounding questions require that the individual answers without having to over think.

00:02:19.940 --> 00:02:22.820
For example; What is your name?

00:02:22.860 --> 00:02:26.140
Where are you from? and what is your favorite color?

00:02:26.320 --> 00:02:29.300
These questions provide an anchor

00:02:29.305 --> 00:02:32.455
that the individual can focus on. If the individual is unable to provide

00:02:32.455 --> 00:02:35.505
verbal answers, then ask yes or no questions.

00:02:35.505 --> 00:02:38.345
These still require that the individual focus on the answer

00:02:38.515 --> 00:02:41.395
and be sure to give them time to answer each question

00:02:41.395 --> 00:02:44.325
and do not overwhelm them or pressure them into answering quickly.

00:02:44.445 --> 00:02:46.835
Patience is extremely important here

00:02:47.595 --> 00:02:50.305
Ask if the individual is okay with being touched

00:02:50.305 --> 00:02:53.485
In a yes or no form.

00:02:53.485 --> 00:02:56.405
If the answer is yes, slowly move toward the individual

00:02:56.405 --> 00:02:58.855
while remaining in their immediate range of eyesight

00:02:59.055 --> 00:03:01.560
Once close enough, you may calmly lay a hand

00:03:01.695 --> 00:03:04.035
On theirs. anymore contact

00:03:04.035 --> 00:03:07.395
should only be initiated from the individual having the attack.

00:03:07.515 --> 00:03:10.635
If the individual requests not to be touched,

00:03:10.635 --> 00:03:13.185
Then simply continue to ask grounding questions.

00:03:13.315 --> 00:03:16.065
You can also repeat where the individual is. (Work, school etc)

00:03:16.065 --> 00:03:19.265
and that they are safe.

00:03:19.265 --> 00:03:22.155
Do not ever touch a person who is experiencing a panic attack

00:03:22.155 --> 00:03:25.185
without asking or receiving permission to do so.

00:03:25.185 --> 00:03:28.065
In some cases, the situation can get worse and their panic can increase

00:03:28.065 --> 00:03:30.840
if the individual is touched without permission.

00:03:31.640 --> 00:03:34.640
Do not leave the individual struggling through the panic attack alone

00:03:34.640 --> 00:03:35.640
Do not leave the individual struggling through the panic attack alone

00:03:35.935 --> 00:03:38.605
One of the scariest parts of a panic attack

00:03:38.605 --> 00:03:41.395
is the inability to focus on all parts of reality

00:03:41.555 --> 00:03:43.685
The individual knowing that they are not alone

00:03:43.685 --> 00:03:46.705
they are not alone can make resurfacing from the panic attack easier.

00:03:46.705 --> 00:03:49.735
the panic attack easier. Do you have any tips on helping someone through a panic attack?
