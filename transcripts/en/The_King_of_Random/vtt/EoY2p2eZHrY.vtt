00:00:00.240 --> 00:00:01.400
Growing up, you may have heard

00:00:01.400 --> 00:00:03.460
that you should never
stick a knife in a toaster,

00:00:03.460 --> 00:00:05.480
and today, we want to try
and do a few tests

00:00:05.480 --> 00:00:07.020
to find out why that is.

00:00:07.020 --> 00:00:08.480
What is going to happen

00:00:08.490 --> 00:00:09.809
if you put a knife in a toaster

00:00:09.809 --> 00:00:11.160
while it's turned on?

00:00:13.100 --> 00:00:18.040
[Music]

00:00:18.040 --> 00:00:19.700
Many years ago,
when I was a child,

00:00:19.700 --> 00:00:21.529
I actually did stick
a knife in a toaster.

00:00:21.529 --> 00:00:24.000
I had never been told
that this was a bad idea,

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:27.400
and I don't know the exact
circumstances behind what I did,

00:00:27.400 --> 00:00:29.900
but I remember getting one
heck of a jolt through my body.

00:00:29.900 --> 00:00:30.800
It wasn't comfortable,

00:00:30.800 --> 00:00:34.180
and I want to avoid doing that,
or anything potentially fatal today.

00:00:34.540 --> 00:00:35.920
Here's the basic idea.

00:00:35.920 --> 00:00:37.400
We're going to test
a few different methods

00:00:37.400 --> 00:00:39.980
of seeing what happens
if you do stick a knife in a toaster.

00:00:39.980 --> 00:00:42.520
We'll try and measure
the current flowing through it,

00:00:42.520 --> 00:00:44.100
and we'll try
and create an analog

00:00:44.100 --> 00:00:45.300
to see what would happen

00:00:45.300 --> 00:00:47.470
if the current were
flowing through a person.

00:00:47.600 --> 00:00:50.300
So here's what I'm going to
be doing to avoid getting shocked.

00:00:50.480 --> 00:00:52.960
First off, my knife
will be attached to a stick

00:00:52.960 --> 00:00:54.700
using some plastic zip ties.

00:00:54.700 --> 00:00:56.480
This should allow me
to have some distance

00:00:56.480 --> 00:00:57.780
away from the toaster,

00:00:57.780 --> 00:00:59.680
and to not have
the current of the knife

00:00:59.680 --> 00:01:01.240
traveling through my hands.

00:01:01.240 --> 00:01:06.240
Second, the hand holding the stick will
be wearing a thick leather welding glove.

00:01:06.500 --> 00:01:08.860
This does not conduct
electricity well at all,

00:01:08.869 --> 00:01:11.329
so, that should prevent
even more current getting to me,

00:01:11.329 --> 00:01:13.880
even if it manages to
travel up through the stick.

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:15.900
I'll be wearing these strange slippers

00:01:15.900 --> 00:01:18.520
that I made out of
Proto-Putty in a different video,

00:01:18.520 --> 00:01:21.980
and I'm going to be standing
on a block of insulation foam.

00:01:21.980 --> 00:01:24.719
My left hand, the one
not holding the stick

00:01:24.719 --> 00:01:27.770
will be behind my back,
or in a pocket the whole time.

00:01:27.770 --> 00:01:30.360
So, there's very little chance
of any electricity conducting

00:01:30.360 --> 00:01:33.439
from one hand through
my chest and my heart

00:01:33.440 --> 00:01:34.440
into the other hand.

00:01:34.900 --> 00:01:36.940
If any electricity
does get conducted,

00:01:36.940 --> 00:01:39.320
it's much more likely
to go through my arm

00:01:39.320 --> 00:01:41.140
and down out of my feet,

00:01:41.140 --> 00:01:44.119
and finally, in case there
are any really bright sparks,

00:01:44.120 --> 00:01:46.260
I'll be wearing a welding mask.

00:01:46.580 --> 00:01:48.040
Let's get all of our safety gear ready,

00:01:48.040 --> 00:01:49.200
plug in our toaster,

00:01:49.200 --> 00:01:49.760
turn it on,

00:01:49.760 --> 00:01:52.160
and then see what happens
if we start poking around in there.

00:01:52.620 --> 00:01:55.770
First, I'm going to try and touch
one of the nichrome heating coils

00:01:55.770 --> 00:01:58.380
without touching any of
the other metal in there.

00:01:58.760 --> 00:02:02.000
This is on a stick,
so, my dexterity may be a little limited.

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:02.940
But, that's the goal.

00:02:02.940 --> 00:02:11.240
[Music]

00:02:11.240 --> 00:02:12.760
Well, I managed
to make the knife warm.

00:02:12.760 --> 00:02:15.260
So, that's your first danger.

00:02:15.260 --> 00:02:17.580
If you leave the knife in
too long while you're holding it,

00:02:17.580 --> 00:02:19.920
it's going to get hot,
and then you'll burn your fingers.

00:02:20.740 --> 00:02:23.240
Now, let's see if I can touch
one of the nichrome wires

00:02:23.240 --> 00:02:25.900
while touching the
metal sides of the toaster,

00:02:26.180 --> 00:02:27.340
see if that does anything different.

00:02:27.340 --> 00:02:37.080
[Music]

00:02:37.080 --> 00:02:39.600
I thought maybe I would
get a couple of sparks,

00:02:39.600 --> 00:02:40.500
something like that.

00:02:40.500 --> 00:02:41.720
Maybe the circuit breaker would trip,

00:02:41.720 --> 00:02:44.900
but a knife not connected to anything
isn't really completing a circuit.

00:02:44.900 --> 00:02:46.480
It's just poking at stuff,

00:02:46.480 --> 00:02:48.960
and I presume the toaster's
already built in such a way

00:02:48.960 --> 00:02:51.280
that if something metal touches
those nichrome wires,

00:02:51.480 --> 00:02:53.440
it's not going to short anything out.

00:02:53.440 --> 00:02:55.580
So, we may have to force the issue.

00:02:55.580 --> 00:02:59.760
I want to see if I can get the knife 
connecting from one wire onto another,

00:02:59.760 --> 00:03:01.390
but since my knife is very straight,

00:03:01.390 --> 00:03:03.740
I'm gonna have to try,
and wrap a little bit of wire

00:03:03.740 --> 00:03:05.860
around some of the
nichrome in the toaster,

00:03:05.860 --> 00:03:10.020
to give me a sort of access point, so 
I can see what happens if the two connect.

00:03:11.020 --> 00:03:11.780
Right.

00:03:11.940 --> 00:03:15.640
That wire is now definitely
in contact with some of the nichrome.

00:03:16.680 --> 00:03:20.180
So I'm gonna try two different things,
I'm going to try touching that wire,

00:03:20.560 --> 00:03:22.660
and the copper wire
connecting those with the knife,

00:03:22.980 --> 00:03:26.140
and I'm going to try touching that 
nichrome element in the wire

00:03:26.140 --> 00:03:27.080
at the same time.

00:03:27.540 --> 00:03:28.800
Let's give this a shot.

00:03:29.940 --> 00:03:30.980
Oh, I saw a spark!

00:03:30.980 --> 00:03:34.100
[Music]

00:03:34.100 --> 00:03:39.600
So not only Is that sparking,
but it's actually like sticking.

00:03:40.660 --> 00:03:43.820
it's like welded the knife
onto the nichrome wire.

00:03:43.820 --> 00:03:45.880
You can also see that the whole toaster

00:03:45.880 --> 00:03:48.360
lights up a lot more
when I'm making this connection.

00:03:50.080 --> 00:03:54.200
[inaudible] the copper wire is actually
attached to the steel knife now.

00:03:54.680 --> 00:03:57.800
All right, we tried one side,
we got some cool sparks,

00:03:57.800 --> 00:04:01.960
the knife started welding itself onto
the nichrome wire and the copper wire,

00:04:02.260 --> 00:04:05.400
so, that's not something you want 
happening while you're making toast.

00:04:05.400 --> 00:04:07.720
Your knife welding itself down in place...

00:04:08.440 --> 00:04:10.160
Let's see what happens
on the other side.

00:04:10.160 --> 00:04:11.260
Will it be the same effect?

00:04:11.260 --> 00:04:14.820
[Music]

00:04:14.820 --> 00:04:15.640
Oh, yep!

00:04:15.640 --> 00:04:21.340
That's that same look we got before,
sparking, welding, glowing extra bright,

00:04:22.100 --> 00:04:22.920
Check this out.

00:04:22.920 --> 00:04:24.699
where I've been connecting,

00:04:24.699 --> 00:04:25.920
the copper wire has heated enough

00:04:25.920 --> 00:04:29.020
that where it touches
the plastic housing of the toaster,

00:04:29.020 --> 00:04:30.460
it started melting into it.

00:04:30.620 --> 00:04:33.840
The coils inside the toaster
have been heating up way hotter

00:04:33.840 --> 00:04:35.320
than I'm pretty sure they're supposed to.

00:04:35.320 --> 00:04:39.539
I want to see just how much electricity 
starts flowing through these things.

00:04:39.539 --> 00:04:41.320
What we want to do now
is take a voltmeter,

00:04:41.320 --> 00:04:43.720
and connect the leads
to the two different sides

00:04:43.720 --> 00:04:47.200
to see how much energy is
flowing through these things.

00:04:48.060 --> 00:04:51.300
Plug it in and I'll just touch
the knife to one of the wires,

00:04:51.300 --> 00:04:53.680
and we can see what
shows up on our voltmeter.

00:04:54.140 --> 00:04:55.280
It looks like while these are connected,

00:04:55.280 --> 00:04:59.000
we have about 50 volts running
from one nichrome wire to the other.

00:04:59.000 --> 00:05:02.240
Another test I want to try
is to see what happens

00:05:02.240 --> 00:05:04.160
if we touch the knife to one of the coils,

00:05:04.160 --> 00:05:07.440
and at the same time to
something that is grounded.

00:05:07.440 --> 00:05:08.960
We're going to take an extension cord,

00:05:08.960 --> 00:05:12.540
fit a wire into the grounding port 
of the end of the extension cord,

00:05:12.540 --> 00:05:15.629
and then see what happens
if we touch one of the nichrome wires

00:05:15.629 --> 00:05:17.280
to that grounded wire.

00:05:17.280 --> 00:05:25.280
[Music]

00:05:25.280 --> 00:05:30.060
That popped the toaster up immediately.

00:05:31.340 --> 00:05:32.920
And I believe I popped the toaster up

00:05:32.920 --> 00:05:35.540
because there's no longer
electricity to the toaster,

00:05:35.540 --> 00:05:38.840
which means almost certainly
we have tripped the breaker.

00:05:39.460 --> 00:05:41.320
We have a GFI in the kitchen,

00:05:41.520 --> 00:05:43.420
and we just had to hit reset on that,

00:05:43.420 --> 00:05:45.080
took us a few minutes to find it.

00:05:45.080 --> 00:05:47.860
It's possible that if something
less conductive than a knife

00:05:47.860 --> 00:05:49.600
had this current running
through it though,

00:05:49.600 --> 00:05:52.760
it could get a good jolt of electricity
without resetting the breaker.

00:05:53.300 --> 00:05:55.840
I have an idea of how we can test that.

00:05:56.140 --> 00:06:00.280
We've now got wire running
from the knife down into the hot dog.

00:06:00.280 --> 00:06:02.320
At the other end of
the hot dog is a wire

00:06:02.440 --> 00:06:05.880
that's connected to
the ground wire in our extension cord.

00:06:06.400 --> 00:06:09.980
And we have both of these plugged in,
and we touch the knife to the nichrome,

00:06:09.980 --> 00:06:14.680
we'll see if it conducts electricity through
the hot dog well enough to trip the breaker

00:06:14.680 --> 00:06:16.780
or if it starts frying the thing.

00:06:16.780 --> 00:06:20.220
[Music]

00:06:20.220 --> 00:06:21.000
Oh!

00:06:21.640 --> 00:06:22.960
Popped it immediately.

00:06:23.380 --> 00:06:25.280
That's probably good for security.

00:06:25.280 --> 00:06:27.960
Now, we have our knife
connected to our hotdog.

00:06:27.960 --> 00:06:31.100
Our hotdog is connected to 
one end of the voltmeter,

00:06:31.100 --> 00:06:34.120
and the other end of the voltmeter
is going into our ground wire.

00:06:34.120 --> 00:06:38.860
[Music]

00:06:38.860 --> 00:06:41.940
109 volts traveling through
that hot dog right now.

00:06:42.320 --> 00:06:43.340
This is pretty interesting.

00:06:43.340 --> 00:06:44.200
I didn't see this coming,

00:06:44.200 --> 00:06:46.640
and that's possibly just
because I don't know everything

00:06:46.640 --> 00:06:48.140
about how toasters work.

00:06:48.460 --> 00:06:51.200
But every different segment
of nichrome wire that I touch

00:06:51.200 --> 00:06:53.440
gives a different readout on the voltmeter.

00:06:53.440 --> 00:06:55.800
Once again, I've hooked
the knife up to the hot dog,

00:06:55.800 --> 00:06:57.600
and the hot dog up to the ground.

00:06:57.600 --> 00:07:02.400
However, this time our toaster is
not plugged into an outlet with the GFI.

00:07:02.400 --> 00:07:05.620
Now, our toaster is plugged into
an outlet that only has a breaker switch

00:07:05.620 --> 00:07:07.220
to turn it off if something goes wrong.

00:07:07.220 --> 00:07:10.860
So, we might see some difference
in what's happening to our hot dog

00:07:10.860 --> 00:07:16.700
[Music]

00:07:16.700 --> 00:07:18.940
And our hot dog is starting to cook,

00:07:19.380 --> 00:07:20.400
Random fact,

00:07:20.400 --> 00:07:24.780
the first electrical toaster
was invented in Scotland in 1893,

00:07:24.780 --> 00:07:28.520
35 years before sliced bread
started being sold in stores.

00:07:28.520 --> 00:07:32.220
[Music]

00:07:32.220 --> 00:07:36.020
Parts of our hotdog got a little
bit scorched by electricity there.

00:07:36.320 --> 00:07:37.060
It was burning,

00:07:37.060 --> 00:07:38.140
you can see the steam coming out--

00:07:38.600 --> 00:07:40.680
This part's actually quite hot in fact.

00:07:40.800 --> 00:07:44.180
By connecting our hotdog to
a circuit that doesn't have a GFI on it,

00:07:44.180 --> 00:07:48.569
we were allowing over a hundred volts
of electricity to run through this hot dog,

00:07:48.569 --> 00:07:49.760
which as you may remember,

00:07:49.760 --> 00:07:50.480
is an analog for

00:07:50.480 --> 00:07:53.240
what would happen if you held
the knife in your bare hand?

00:07:53.240 --> 00:07:54.720
Based on this set of experiments,

00:07:54.720 --> 00:07:56.920
we learned that if you stick
a knife into a toaster,

00:07:56.920 --> 00:07:58.420
not too much really happens.

00:07:58.420 --> 00:08:01.520
Unless some part of your body
is electrically grounded as you do,

00:08:01.520 --> 00:08:04.920
in which case, you're going to get
a real shock that could potentially kill you.

00:08:04.920 --> 00:08:08.100
if the toaster is plugged into
a switch on a GFI circuit,

00:08:08.100 --> 00:08:09.440
you'll likely get a little shock,

00:08:09.440 --> 00:08:12.260
but the GFI should
trip instantly and save your life.

00:08:12.380 --> 00:08:13.740
But why take the chance?

00:08:13.740 --> 00:08:15.800
Don't stick knives in toasters.

00:08:16.860 --> 00:08:18.240
Guys, we've got more for you to see.

you should be watching next,

00:08:25.320 --> 00:08:26.660
and if you hit this bomb in the middle,

00:08:26.660 --> 00:08:29.420
you'll be subscribed to our channel
so you never miss a video.

00:08:29.420 --> 00:08:31.800
Don't forget to ring that bell,
and we'll see you in the next one.

00:08:31.800 --> 00:08:32.680
Talk to you then.
