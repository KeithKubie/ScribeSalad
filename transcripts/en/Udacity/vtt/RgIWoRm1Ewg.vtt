All right,
welcome back to Computer Vision.

00:00:03.440 --> 00:00:05.170
If you recall last time I said that,

00:00:05.170 --> 00:00:08.410
that was going to end our,
recognition, discussion.

00:00:08.410 --> 00:00:12.130
When we talked about SVMs and
discriminative learning, well I lied.

00:00:12.130 --> 00:00:15.190
Basically what I'm going to talk about
is what's referred to as a bag of words

00:00:15.190 --> 00:00:17.160
approach to doing recognition.

00:00:17.160 --> 00:00:21.070
And it, it was used somewhat in
static images, a lot in video but it,

00:00:21.070 --> 00:00:23.800
it really should follow
right after doing the SVM.
