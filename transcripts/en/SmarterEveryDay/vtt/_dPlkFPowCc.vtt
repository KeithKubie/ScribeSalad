Hey it's me Destin. Ahh.. I got my

00:00:04.060 --> 00:00:08.100
dad a present for father's day, and it's kind of weird, so I figured

00:00:08.120 --> 00:00:10.120
I'd show you an interesting principle with the present.

00:00:14.140 --> 00:00:16.130
It's a chicken. I got my dad a chicken

00:00:16.150 --> 00:00:20.140
for father's day, and I want to show you a pretty interesting method

00:00:20.160 --> 00:00:24.190
that chickens have to keep their heads stable. You know in guidance and control you have

00:00:24.210 --> 00:00:28.230
feedback loops and so you have to know your position, and

00:00:28.250 --> 00:00:32.270
where your relative motion is going so you can compensate for it, but chickens are really good

00:00:32.290 --> 00:00:36.300
at this, so I'll show you.. Watch his head stay totally stationary

00:00:36.320 --> 00:00:40.320
as I move his body.

00:00:40.340 --> 00:00:44.330
I can move his body in pretty much any direction and his head stays

00:00:44.350 --> 00:00:48.380
rock solid in one position.

00:00:48.400 --> 00:00:52.430
This is really hard to do. So anyway, he knows exactly

00:00:52.450 --> 00:00:56.450
where his body is and where his body's moving.

00:01:00.510 --> 00:01:04.510
It's kinda fun to watch isn't it. So, they're really good at it

00:01:04.530 --> 00:01:08.550
I don't really know why, but I'm sure there's an explanation

00:01:08.570 --> 00:01:12.600
There's my sister Browley with the other

00:01:12.620 --> 00:01:16.620
chicken we got dad, so..

00:01:16.640 --> 00:01:20.630
(Sister) Mine does tail tricks. Up down, up, down.
-Anyway,

00:01:20.650 --> 00:01:22.640
look how solid his head is.

00:01:27.060 --> 00:01:28.700
That's kinda stupid, he'd probably peck me in the eye

00:01:28.720 --> 00:01:32.710
so I'll stop now. Alright, so bye.

00:01:32.730 --> 00:01:37.050
(Dad) The perfect father's day gift.
- Yep, he liked it.

00:01:39.070 --> 00:01:40.790
