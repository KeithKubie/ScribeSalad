00:00:06.500 --> 00:00:07.940
BENJAMIN SCHROM: Hello.

00:00:07.940 --> 00:00:09.610
Welcome to our session.

00:00:09.610 --> 00:00:12.122
We really appreciate you
choosing to spend the next 40

00:00:12.122 --> 00:00:14.080
minutes here with us
given the number of things

00:00:14.080 --> 00:00:18.220
that are going on at I/O.
It's really busy time.

00:00:18.220 --> 00:00:20.420
My name is Benjamin
Schrom, and I'm

00:00:20.420 --> 00:00:23.810
joined here by Jennifer
Miller and Brittany Mennuti.

00:00:23.810 --> 00:00:26.510
And we're all from
the team at Google

00:00:26.510 --> 00:00:28.100
working on immersive computing.

00:00:28.100 --> 00:00:31.190
We want to talk to you today
about using immersive computing

00:00:31.190 --> 00:00:34.130
for teaching and learning in a
few really important and really

00:00:34.130 --> 00:00:35.405
different contexts.

00:00:35.405 --> 00:00:37.280
But first I want
to make sure we're

00:00:37.280 --> 00:00:41.230
all on the same page about what
we mean by immersive computing.

00:00:41.230 --> 00:00:44.540
In the simplest terms
we mean VR and AR.

00:00:44.540 --> 00:00:47.810
VR, that can take you anywhere,
like to the Taj Mahal,

00:00:47.810 --> 00:00:53.810
to another place and time, down
to the atomic level, wherever.

00:00:53.810 --> 00:00:57.210
And AR that can bring you
anything, a dinosaur, a jet

00:00:57.210 --> 00:01:01.590
engine, da Vinci's 15th century
design for a helicopter,

00:01:01.590 --> 00:01:05.381
or just information about
the world around you.

00:01:05.381 --> 00:01:07.380
But the reason we say,
and will continue to say,

00:01:07.380 --> 00:01:09.630
immersive computing
is that at Google, we

00:01:09.630 --> 00:01:12.810
look at these technologies
as occupying different areas

00:01:12.810 --> 00:01:14.710
on a shared spectrum.

00:01:14.710 --> 00:01:16.660
Increasingly, all
points on the spectrum

00:01:16.660 --> 00:01:20.602
are beginning to blur
together more and more.

00:01:20.602 --> 00:01:23.060
So the plan today is to spend
a few minutes walking through

00:01:23.060 --> 00:01:26.030
specifically why and how we
see this technology being

00:01:26.030 --> 00:01:27.612
used for teaching and learning.

00:01:27.612 --> 00:01:29.570
And again, we really mean
teaching and learning

00:01:29.570 --> 00:01:31.530
in the broadest sense.

00:01:31.530 --> 00:01:33.890
So I'll share some updates
about Google Expeditions.

00:01:33.890 --> 00:01:35.810
Jen will talk to us
about our efforts

00:01:35.810 --> 00:01:38.245
to bring this technology
to higher education.

00:01:38.245 --> 00:01:40.620
And then finally, Brit will
walk us through Tour Creator.

00:01:43.180 --> 00:01:45.840
So why are we here for
the third I/O in a row

00:01:45.840 --> 00:01:46.710
talking about this?

00:01:46.710 --> 00:01:50.240
Like, what's the big idea here?

00:01:50.240 --> 00:01:53.600
For us, the really powerful idea
is that we have an opportunity,

00:01:53.600 --> 00:01:56.270
with almost any technology
on this immersive computing

00:01:56.270 --> 00:01:59.810
spectrum, to help turn the
abstract representations

00:01:59.810 --> 00:02:02.570
of things that form so
much of our education,

00:02:02.570 --> 00:02:05.900
of our work, of just sort of
how we perceive the world,

00:02:05.900 --> 00:02:08.180
into more concrete
experiences that

00:02:08.180 --> 00:02:10.970
activate our minds
and our bodies

00:02:10.970 --> 00:02:13.400
and allow us to
learn by experience,

00:02:13.400 --> 00:02:17.149
sort of a continuation of how
we all learned things as kids.

00:02:17.149 --> 00:02:18.690
And for the set of
things we're going

00:02:18.690 --> 00:02:20.820
to talk about
today, what we want

00:02:20.820 --> 00:02:23.160
to enable is this
technology makes

00:02:23.160 --> 00:02:26.460
those concrete experiences much
more regular things, much more

00:02:26.460 --> 00:02:30.084
accessible, and as
effective as possible.

00:02:30.084 --> 00:02:32.250
And this is really important
because we all need it,

00:02:32.250 --> 00:02:34.390
like our kids will need
it, future generations

00:02:34.390 --> 00:02:37.060
will need it.

00:02:37.060 --> 00:02:40.690
So two years ago at I/O, I
posed this classic math problem

00:02:40.690 --> 00:02:41.410
to the audience.

00:02:41.410 --> 00:02:42.940
And I wanted to
check back and see

00:02:42.940 --> 00:02:47.450
if anyone got the answer
in these last two years.

00:02:47.450 --> 00:02:50.010
I've actually now learned
this is a classic problem.

00:02:50.010 --> 00:02:52.860
It's actually called the
Age of the Captain problem.

00:02:52.860 --> 00:02:54.660
Many, many studies
have posed this

00:02:54.660 --> 00:02:58.770
or similar sorts of questions to
primary and secondary students.

00:02:58.770 --> 00:03:02.960
Anyone have an answer on
how old the captain is?

00:03:02.960 --> 00:03:07.124
It turns out a majority
of your average primary

00:03:07.124 --> 00:03:08.540
and secondary
school math students

00:03:08.540 --> 00:03:12.680
will produce a numerical answer
to this question, 66 out of 97

00:03:12.680 --> 00:03:16.097
in the most recent
study I could find.

00:03:16.097 --> 00:03:17.680
The researchers in
this study actually

00:03:17.680 --> 00:03:21.220
termed this phenomena "the
suspension of sense-making",

00:03:21.220 --> 00:03:24.150
which now that I know it, is
actually a really useful phrase

00:03:24.150 --> 00:03:25.870
in all kinds of contexts.

00:03:25.870 --> 00:03:28.330
But it's kind of a doomsday
scenario for when learning

00:03:28.330 --> 00:03:30.495
becomes too abstracted.

00:03:30.495 --> 00:03:31.870
And I think it
really illustrates

00:03:31.870 --> 00:03:33.820
for us both the challenge
and the opportunity

00:03:33.820 --> 00:03:36.840
that we have before us.

00:03:36.840 --> 00:03:41.520
The opportunity is that instead
of asking a student why they

00:03:41.520 --> 00:03:45.700
should spend time studying
why ancient Rome is important,

00:03:45.700 --> 00:03:48.300
or asking them to appreciate
these amazing artifacts

00:03:48.300 --> 00:03:51.810
of human history with just some
little pictures in a textbook

00:03:51.810 --> 00:03:54.870
or a video on a
little screen, you

00:03:54.870 --> 00:03:58.350
can let them explore it in VR,
like they were there in Rome.

00:03:58.350 --> 00:04:02.080
You can give them this
bite-sized field trip moment

00:04:02.080 --> 00:04:03.960
that engages their
mind, their body,

00:04:03.960 --> 00:04:07.200
gives them the agency
to look around.

00:04:07.200 --> 00:04:10.020
Or you can let them evaluate
a statue of a powerful woman

00:04:10.020 --> 00:04:12.522
in history, like Cleopatra,
like it was standing right

00:04:12.522 --> 00:04:13.230
in front of them.

00:04:15.740 --> 00:04:17.699
Another way to think
about this is a theory

00:04:17.699 --> 00:04:20.240
that's popular among cognitive
scientists who study learning,

00:04:20.240 --> 00:04:22.070
the so-called
cognitive load theory.

00:04:22.070 --> 00:04:24.890
People heard of this?

00:04:24.890 --> 00:04:27.070
It says that our
ability to learn,

00:04:27.070 --> 00:04:29.950
you can think about
it like it's a funnel.

00:04:29.950 --> 00:04:32.140
And basically it's the
total mental energy

00:04:32.140 --> 00:04:35.020
that we have to learn
something is what's left over

00:04:35.020 --> 00:04:37.090
after you've subtracted
the inherent difficulty

00:04:37.090 --> 00:04:39.400
of the thing that you're
trying to understand to learn,

00:04:39.400 --> 00:04:41.350
plus the effort
required to understand

00:04:41.350 --> 00:04:43.466
how that concept is presented.

00:04:43.466 --> 00:04:45.340
So what you're left with
is the mental energy

00:04:45.340 --> 00:04:46.390
you have to learn.

00:04:46.390 --> 00:04:50.310
So if fractions had an
inherent difficulty of x,

00:04:50.310 --> 00:04:53.350
there's this other
difficulty of y

00:04:53.350 --> 00:04:55.570
that's just trying
to understand how

00:04:55.570 --> 00:04:58.330
fractions are presented to
you or how it's taught to you.

00:04:58.330 --> 00:05:00.700
And we can't do much about
the inherent difficulty

00:05:00.700 --> 00:05:01.900
of these concepts.

00:05:01.900 --> 00:05:03.889
The world is a really
complicated place.

00:05:03.889 --> 00:05:06.430
But we can do something about
that orange part of the funnel,

00:05:06.430 --> 00:05:07.804
about how information
is actually

00:05:07.804 --> 00:05:11.121
presented to people when
they're trying to learn it.

00:05:11.121 --> 00:05:12.870
But when you look at
so many of the places

00:05:12.870 --> 00:05:16.410
that learning actually happens,
like classrooms and lecture

00:05:16.410 --> 00:05:20.910
halls, they really aren't set up
to lessen that cognitive load.

00:05:20.910 --> 00:05:23.520
They're basically only
set up to explain things

00:05:23.520 --> 00:05:27.349
with words or 2D drawings.

00:05:27.349 --> 00:05:28.890
And then you realize
that not a lot's

00:05:28.890 --> 00:05:30.900
changed in hundreds
of years, like this

00:05:30.900 --> 00:05:34.720
is how we were teaching
people in the 15th century.

00:05:34.720 --> 00:05:37.450
And for us, it makes
scenes of students

00:05:37.450 --> 00:05:41.810
using AR in their class
seem almost overdue.

00:05:41.810 --> 00:05:45.840
So let's start with talking
about Google Expeditions.

00:05:45.840 --> 00:05:49.590
We launched Expeditions
at I/O three years ago,

00:05:49.590 --> 00:05:52.210
and it's been incredible
to watch it grow.

00:05:52.210 --> 00:05:54.300
And now tens and tens
of thousands of schools

00:05:54.300 --> 00:05:56.940
are using it every single day.

00:05:56.940 --> 00:05:58.770
But at its core,
Expeditions really

00:05:58.770 --> 00:06:01.410
hasn't changed much from
how we first conceived it.

00:06:01.410 --> 00:06:03.150
It's a tool that
allows a teacher--

00:06:03.150 --> 00:06:05.010
or we call them a guide--

00:06:05.010 --> 00:06:08.430
to take groups of co-located
students on virtual field trips

00:06:08.430 --> 00:06:12.130
or show them virtual things.

00:06:12.130 --> 00:06:14.470
And since we
announced it in 2015,

00:06:14.470 --> 00:06:16.170
we've continued to see it grow.

00:06:16.170 --> 00:06:17.670
And we've continued
to add features

00:06:17.670 --> 00:06:22.060
to make it even more powerful
and even more accessible.

00:06:22.060 --> 00:06:24.370
And as of today, we're
really excited to share

00:06:24.370 --> 00:06:27.340
that over three million students
and teachers have participated

00:06:27.340 --> 00:06:29.950
in one of our Pioneer
Programs, and that Expeditions

00:06:29.950 --> 00:06:33.130
has been installed on
over six million devices.

00:06:33.130 --> 00:06:36.192
And we're so encouraged by
the continued enthusiasm

00:06:36.192 --> 00:06:38.650
and excitement we've seen from
teachers and students who've

00:06:38.650 --> 00:06:40.191
been using it for
multiple years now.

00:06:42.710 --> 00:06:45.650
In addition to the steady
stream of qualitative feedback

00:06:45.650 --> 00:06:47.180
we've received,
we've also started

00:06:47.180 --> 00:06:49.750
to get some real quantitative
data back as well.

00:06:49.750 --> 00:06:51.660
And it's still early
days for this stuff,

00:06:51.660 --> 00:06:56.510
but in a recent study, we
worked with researchers at SRI,

00:06:56.510 --> 00:06:59.270
we found that students that
used Expeditions VR as part

00:06:59.270 --> 00:07:03.620
of a specific science lesson
outperformed those students who

00:07:03.620 --> 00:07:06.350
used that same lesson but
with traditional 2D media,

00:07:06.350 --> 00:07:07.880
like pictures and video.

00:07:07.880 --> 00:07:10.190
And they did so by a
statistically significant

00:07:10.190 --> 00:07:12.314
number.

00:07:12.314 --> 00:07:13.980
So I wanted to share
a few of the things

00:07:13.980 --> 00:07:16.440
that we've learned along
the way and some things

00:07:16.440 --> 00:07:17.940
that we're doing
to make Expeditions

00:07:17.940 --> 00:07:21.810
even better and even
more accessible.

00:07:21.810 --> 00:07:23.730
So first, we've learned
that while cardboard

00:07:23.730 --> 00:07:26.730
might be an awesome material out
of which to build a universally

00:07:26.730 --> 00:07:29.610
available VR headset, it
might not be the best material

00:07:29.610 --> 00:07:31.710
out of which to build
a VR kit for schools

00:07:31.710 --> 00:07:34.590
to use Expeditions with.

00:07:34.590 --> 00:07:37.940
This was the first Expeditions
kit box we made back in 2015,

00:07:37.940 --> 00:07:40.260
and we were so excited
when it arrived.

00:07:40.260 --> 00:07:42.070
We thought it was the
coolest thing ever.

00:07:42.070 --> 00:07:45.160
We had cardboard headsets,
we had a cardboard kit.

00:07:45.160 --> 00:07:47.110
Well, there was our
Expeditions cardboard box

00:07:47.110 --> 00:07:50.860
after about two
hours in a classroom.

00:07:50.860 --> 00:07:51.910
Big surprise, right?

00:07:51.910 --> 00:07:54.999
Classrooms are harsh
environments for technology.

00:07:54.999 --> 00:07:57.290
So we knew we had to bring
on some partners to help us.

00:07:57.290 --> 00:07:59.260
And so today we have
kits like this in school

00:07:59.260 --> 00:08:01.290
across the world.

00:08:01.290 --> 00:08:03.630
Who here wishes they
had a VR cart like that

00:08:03.630 --> 00:08:05.880
in their class
instead of a TV cart?

00:08:05.880 --> 00:08:09.140
Yeah, me too.

00:08:09.140 --> 00:08:11.080
We now have over 10
different partners

00:08:11.080 --> 00:08:13.762
offering kits in over a
dozen different countries.

00:08:16.660 --> 00:08:18.310
We've also learned
that if we want

00:08:18.310 --> 00:08:19.870
to reach the most
number of learners

00:08:19.870 --> 00:08:22.920
possible with technology
like VR and AR,

00:08:22.920 --> 00:08:25.300
we need to remove as many
technological prerequisites as

00:08:25.300 --> 00:08:26.410
possible.

00:08:26.410 --> 00:08:30.110
So we started by allowing
Expeditions to work offline

00:08:30.110 --> 00:08:32.770
so that even in schools
like this one in Ghana,

00:08:32.770 --> 00:08:36.010
they could travel
the world with VR.

00:08:36.010 --> 00:08:38.919
Or in this school hundreds
of miles up the Amazon River,

00:08:38.919 --> 00:08:41.128
they could go outside and
compare their environment

00:08:41.128 --> 00:08:42.669
to ones all the way
across the world.

00:08:45.490 --> 00:08:48.340
So last year we removed
another prerequisite and made

00:08:48.340 --> 00:08:50.830
Expeditions work for users
who didn't find themselves

00:08:50.830 --> 00:08:52.659
in a classroom or in a group.

00:08:52.659 --> 00:08:54.700
And we've actually seen
lots and lots of teachers

00:08:54.700 --> 00:08:56.572
use the solo mode
in their classes

00:08:56.572 --> 00:08:58.780
to let their students explore
the world on their own.

00:09:01.700 --> 00:09:04.430
And we'll soon be updating
the Expeditions home screen

00:09:04.430 --> 00:09:07.400
to make self-guided tours much
easier to discover and jump

00:09:07.400 --> 00:09:09.470
into, while still
making it really simple

00:09:09.470 --> 00:09:10.970
and straightforward
to use in class.

00:09:14.390 --> 00:09:16.792
We've also been making some
really amazing new content,

00:09:16.792 --> 00:09:19.000
like the set of Expeditions
we made with the Earth VR

00:09:19.000 --> 00:09:21.490
team that brings the
incredible experience of seeing

00:09:21.490 --> 00:09:24.250
Google Earth in VR to
Cardboard and Daydream.

00:09:24.250 --> 00:09:26.710
And we used the technology the
Daydream team recently open

00:09:26.710 --> 00:09:28.960
sourced and made
available called Seurat.

00:09:28.960 --> 00:09:31.780
Seurat allows you to take a
highly complicated 3D mesh,

00:09:31.780 --> 00:09:34.690
like this scene from Google
Earth of New York City,

00:09:34.690 --> 00:09:36.700
and simplifies it
down to a scene that,

00:09:36.700 --> 00:09:40.580
within a limited headbox, can
be viewed on mobile VR devices.

00:09:40.580 --> 00:09:43.630
It's really, really
powerful stuff.

00:09:43.630 --> 00:09:45.720
And it's especially
really powerful stuff

00:09:45.720 --> 00:09:48.990
on the recently announced
Lenovo Mirage solo device.

00:09:48.990 --> 00:09:50.560
These sorts of
Expeditions really,

00:09:50.560 --> 00:09:52.880
really come alive with
the six degrees of freedom

00:09:52.880 --> 00:09:53.880
you get with the Mirage.

00:09:56.320 --> 00:09:58.570
And we've continued to add
just more and more engaging

00:09:58.570 --> 00:10:01.090
and interesting content to
our library of Expeditions.

00:10:01.090 --> 00:10:03.160
We now have over 800
different Expeditions

00:10:03.160 --> 00:10:06.160
spinning history,
STEM subjects, art.

00:10:06.160 --> 00:10:07.970
There's really
something for everyone,

00:10:07.970 --> 00:10:13.420
every teacher, every
student every curious adult.

00:10:13.420 --> 00:10:15.790
We will also continue to
partner with the real experts

00:10:15.790 --> 00:10:18.630
in the field of educational
publishing, like HMH.

00:10:18.630 --> 00:10:20.544
We now have a series
of Expeditions

00:10:20.544 --> 00:10:22.960
that supplement their textbooks
and, as we were discussing

00:10:22.960 --> 00:10:25.750
at the outset, make all that
important information contained

00:10:25.750 --> 00:10:28.690
within the textbook become
more accessible and concrete

00:10:28.690 --> 00:10:32.472
with the set of
accompanying VR content.

00:10:32.472 --> 00:10:33.930
But most importantly,
we've learned

00:10:33.930 --> 00:10:36.540
that when you take
students to amazing places,

00:10:36.540 --> 00:10:39.430
like underwater
among coral reefs,

00:10:39.430 --> 00:10:42.340
they really want to investigate
the things they see there,

00:10:42.340 --> 00:10:46.677
like coral or sharks.

00:10:46.677 --> 00:10:47.760
They want to get up close.

00:10:47.760 --> 00:10:48.780
They want to take
the opportunity

00:10:48.780 --> 00:10:50.321
to look at this guy
right in the eye,

00:10:50.321 --> 00:10:54.860
to look at those
rows of sharp teeth.

00:10:54.860 --> 00:10:57.260
So Expeditions AR is
our answer for how

00:10:57.260 --> 00:11:00.620
you bring that shark into the
classroom such that everyone

00:11:00.620 --> 00:11:03.559
remains dry and intact.

00:11:03.559 --> 00:11:05.600
We gave you a preview of
Exhibitions AR last year

00:11:05.600 --> 00:11:08.484
at I/O. And we
spent the last year

00:11:08.484 --> 00:11:09.900
taking our beta
application around

00:11:09.900 --> 00:11:13.270
to schools all over the world.

00:11:13.270 --> 00:11:15.850
Over one million
students and teachers

00:11:15.850 --> 00:11:17.350
participated in our beta.

00:11:17.350 --> 00:11:18.820
They gave us their thoughts.

00:11:18.820 --> 00:11:20.920
They helped us refine
it and improve it.

00:11:20.920 --> 00:11:23.410
We wanted to take this
chance to thank them

00:11:23.410 --> 00:11:25.570
for such thoughtful
feedback, for seeing

00:11:25.570 --> 00:11:27.800
through some of the
early rough edges,

00:11:27.800 --> 00:11:31.270
and for just inspiring us to
build it each and every day.

00:11:31.270 --> 00:11:33.880
Go ahead and check out hashtag
#GoogleExpeditions on Twitter

00:11:33.880 --> 00:11:36.760
if you wanted to see some
amazing scenes of people

00:11:36.760 --> 00:11:40.350
using Expeditions AR.

00:11:40.350 --> 00:11:43.750
The feedback we've received
has been super encouraging,

00:11:43.750 --> 00:11:46.240
like this ninth grade teacher
from Boise, Idaho, who

00:11:46.240 --> 00:11:49.050
saw her classroom come alive.

00:11:49.050 --> 00:11:51.210
We love that last
part in the quote

00:11:51.210 --> 00:11:53.530
most of all, that
students have become both

00:11:53.530 --> 00:11:55.780
the teacher and the learner.

00:11:55.780 --> 00:11:58.520
And this is really
the holy grail,

00:11:58.520 --> 00:12:00.219
giving amazing
teachers like Karen

00:12:00.219 --> 00:12:02.510
the technological instruments
to make moments like this

00:12:02.510 --> 00:12:06.340
happen in her classroom.

00:12:06.340 --> 00:12:09.020
So Exhibitions AR will be
shipping as a major update

00:12:09.020 --> 00:12:10.770
to our already launched app.

00:12:10.770 --> 00:12:12.871
AR will live alongside
VR in the same binary.

00:12:12.871 --> 00:12:14.870
And we'll be shipping it
at the end of the month

00:12:14.870 --> 00:12:17.480
with over 100 different
AR Expeditions composed

00:12:17.480 --> 00:12:20.690
of objects that span the same
breadth that our VR tours do.

00:12:20.690 --> 00:12:23.820
History, art, chemistry,
biology, natural history,

00:12:23.820 --> 00:12:25.784
math, the list goes on.

00:12:25.784 --> 00:12:28.200
And I want to give you a quick
run through of the features

00:12:28.200 --> 00:12:30.900
we'll be launching with.

00:12:30.900 --> 00:12:34.106
First, as we do in VR, one
of the most powerful tools

00:12:34.106 --> 00:12:35.730
that we can give a
guide is the ability

00:12:35.730 --> 00:12:38.400
to draw the group's
attention to specific areas

00:12:38.400 --> 00:12:40.010
or points of interest.

00:12:40.010 --> 00:12:42.330
But we needed to design
a new way to point out

00:12:42.330 --> 00:12:44.020
parts of the object.

00:12:44.020 --> 00:12:45.660
So we built a
spotlight feature that

00:12:45.660 --> 00:12:48.750
lets a teacher shine a light
on part of the object such

00:12:48.750 --> 00:12:50.980
that all the
students can see it.

00:12:50.980 --> 00:12:53.140
The teacher can move
that spotlight around,

00:12:53.140 --> 00:12:55.630
they can make it a
pinpoint or a floodlight.

00:12:55.630 --> 00:12:57.340
It looks really, really cool.

00:12:59.860 --> 00:13:03.590
We also learned that the bigger
the elephant, the better.

00:13:03.590 --> 00:13:06.250
But the spaces people have
available to them are all

00:13:06.250 --> 00:13:07.960
different sizes,
so you need to be

00:13:07.960 --> 00:13:10.704
able to quickly resize it
and let that propagate to all

00:13:10.704 --> 00:13:11.620
the connected devices.

00:13:14.310 --> 00:13:16.341
And while we don't use
markers for tracking,

00:13:16.341 --> 00:13:18.590
we've learned that physical
marker images can actually

00:13:18.590 --> 00:13:20.840
be a great way of establishing
a common reference

00:13:20.840 --> 00:13:23.974
point for large groups that
are viewing the same object.

00:13:23.974 --> 00:13:25.640
So with Expeditions,
you can put down up

00:13:25.640 --> 00:13:28.056
to eight different
markers around your space,

00:13:28.056 --> 00:13:29.930
and the objects you
choose to show your group

00:13:29.930 --> 00:13:32.110
will display right
on top of them.

00:13:32.110 --> 00:13:34.330
This helps to ensure you
don't have 30 kids crowded

00:13:34.330 --> 00:13:37.290
around the same object.

00:13:37.290 --> 00:13:39.600
And just like we have
a solo mode in VR,

00:13:39.600 --> 00:13:41.760
we also have a solo mode in AR.

00:13:41.760 --> 00:13:44.670
So if you aren't guiding a
group, you don't need a marker.

00:13:44.670 --> 00:13:47.220
You can just tap on any plane
that your device detects

00:13:47.220 --> 00:13:49.000
to place that object
and have a look,

00:13:49.000 --> 00:13:51.810
and you get all the explanatory
information in a little card

00:13:51.810 --> 00:13:53.202
to read about.

00:13:53.202 --> 00:13:55.410
Like, who doesn't want the
Mars Rover on their table?

00:13:58.410 --> 00:13:59.869
So as I said before,
Expeditions AR

00:13:59.869 --> 00:14:02.076
will be shipping at the end
of the month as an update

00:14:02.076 --> 00:14:03.210
to our current application.

00:14:03.210 --> 00:14:05.460
There's no need to
install anything new.

00:14:05.460 --> 00:14:07.770
To experience AR, you'll
need an ARCore enabled

00:14:07.770 --> 00:14:11.120
device like the Pixel.

00:14:11.120 --> 00:14:13.210
But for schools that
love their VR kits--

00:14:13.210 --> 00:14:15.370
and there are more and
more and more of them--

00:14:15.370 --> 00:14:16.930
Best Buy Education
will be offering

00:14:16.930 --> 00:14:20.170
a best of both
worlds VR and ARKit

00:14:20.170 --> 00:14:22.270
built with the Asus ZenFone AR.

00:14:22.270 --> 00:14:24.940
And this device does
high quality AR and VR

00:14:24.940 --> 00:14:27.690
just beautifully.

00:14:27.690 --> 00:14:29.430
We're also really
excited to announce

00:14:29.430 --> 00:14:31.890
that the recently debuted
Acer Chrometab 10,

00:14:31.890 --> 00:14:34.200
the world's first Chrome
OS tablet designed

00:14:34.200 --> 00:14:36.390
from the ground up
for use in schools,

00:14:36.390 --> 00:14:41.130
will be supporting both
ARCore and Expeditions AR.

00:14:41.130 --> 00:14:44.260
And finally, for those schools
with ARKit-enabled iPads,

00:14:44.260 --> 00:14:45.990
we'll also be bringing
these same updates

00:14:45.990 --> 00:14:47.550
to the Expeditions iOS app.

00:14:47.550 --> 00:14:49.050
And just like Cloud
Anchors that you

00:14:49.050 --> 00:14:50.720
may have heard of in
an earlier session,

00:14:50.720 --> 00:14:52.710
it will work
cross-platform so you

00:14:52.710 --> 00:14:55.511
can use an Android device to
guide an iOS device or vice

00:14:55.511 --> 00:14:56.010
versa.

00:14:58.780 --> 00:15:00.270
So that's it for Expeditions.

00:15:00.270 --> 00:15:03.330
A beautiful new UI,
a powerful set of AR

00:15:03.330 --> 00:15:06.870
features, and a bunch of cool
AR content to go with it.

00:15:06.870 --> 00:15:08.610
It's basically a
museum in your pocket.

00:15:11.020 --> 00:15:11.520
OK.

00:15:11.520 --> 00:15:13.730
So we're going to
change gears here.

00:15:13.730 --> 00:15:14.570
We're excited, too.

00:15:14.570 --> 00:15:15.069
Thank you.

00:15:15.069 --> 00:15:18.077
[APPLAUSE]

00:15:18.077 --> 00:15:20.660
Beyond K-12 learning, we're also
seeing lots and lots of signs

00:15:20.660 --> 00:15:23.420
that this technology can
create engaging experiences

00:15:23.420 --> 00:15:24.800
for university students.

00:15:24.800 --> 00:15:28.230
And to talk to you about that,
I'd like to introduce Jen.

00:15:28.230 --> 00:15:29.480
JENNIFER HOLLAND: Thanks, Ben.

00:15:33.180 --> 00:15:35.000
Beyond the
curriculum, we quickly

00:15:35.000 --> 00:15:37.730
learned that there was even
broader learning opportunities

00:15:37.730 --> 00:15:39.320
with VR.

00:15:39.320 --> 00:15:41.270
In the same way
that learning can

00:15:41.270 --> 00:15:45.920
be an abstraction for many
students, going to college,

00:15:45.920 --> 00:15:48.110
pursuing different
careers is an abstraction

00:15:48.110 --> 00:15:50.430
for students around the world.

00:15:50.430 --> 00:15:52.740
These students don't have
access to the mentors

00:15:52.740 --> 00:15:54.270
and the professionals
in their life

00:15:54.270 --> 00:15:56.340
that have experience
going to college

00:15:56.340 --> 00:16:00.810
or have experience
pursuing different careers.

00:16:00.810 --> 00:16:02.820
So for the past few
years, we've been

00:16:02.820 --> 00:16:06.780
creating hundreds of college
and career Expeditions

00:16:06.780 --> 00:16:09.630
to enable students to be
able to visualize what it's

00:16:09.630 --> 00:16:13.170
like taking that step
across that graduation stage

00:16:13.170 --> 00:16:17.010
and accepting that diploma,
or taking that first step

00:16:17.010 --> 00:16:20.430
and applying for that dream job.

00:16:20.430 --> 00:16:24.060
And along those same lines,
many educational programs

00:16:24.060 --> 00:16:26.130
have not been
traditionally represented

00:16:26.130 --> 00:16:28.430
by women and minorities.

00:16:28.430 --> 00:16:30.180
And it can be difficult
for these students

00:16:30.180 --> 00:16:34.110
to imagine what it's like to
participate in these programs.

00:16:34.110 --> 00:16:38.010
But we know VR can
help with this.

00:16:38.010 --> 00:16:41.650
One school, the New York
Tandon School of Engineering,

00:16:41.650 --> 00:16:45.210
has taken us to a
completely other level.

00:16:45.210 --> 00:16:48.510
They were looking to improve
the impact and the diversity

00:16:48.510 --> 00:16:50.610
of their incoming
freshman class.

00:16:50.610 --> 00:16:52.950
So they created a VR app.

00:16:52.950 --> 00:16:56.070
And they enlisted the help
of students and faculty

00:16:56.070 --> 00:16:58.260
and built a bunch of
different experiences

00:16:58.260 --> 00:17:00.930
showcasing the different
projects and programs happening

00:17:00.930 --> 00:17:02.310
on their campus.

00:17:02.310 --> 00:17:05.319
And the admissions team
created these custom

00:17:05.319 --> 00:17:09.040
branded cardboards, sent out a
letter to all admitted students

00:17:09.040 --> 00:17:13.180
with instructions on how to
actually download the VR app.

00:17:13.180 --> 00:17:16.480
And apart from doing this
to separate themselves

00:17:16.480 --> 00:17:20.020
from other schools, the
immersive experience,

00:17:20.020 --> 00:17:23.800
mainly highlighting the work
of female students and faculty

00:17:23.800 --> 00:17:26.089
and narrated by a
woman, has helped

00:17:26.089 --> 00:17:29.950
to increase the female
acceptance rate of students

00:17:29.950 --> 00:17:34.520
by over 10% in just two years.

00:17:34.520 --> 00:17:35.374
Yeah, come on.

00:17:35.374 --> 00:17:36.290
We can cheer for that.

00:17:38.850 --> 00:17:41.180
That's so impressive.

00:17:41.180 --> 00:17:44.150
When the admissions office
surveyed that incoming class,

00:17:44.150 --> 00:17:46.910
many cited the VR app
as one of the reasons

00:17:46.910 --> 00:17:49.599
why they chose the New York
Tandon School of Engineering

00:17:49.599 --> 00:17:51.890
because they could visualize
what their four years were

00:17:51.890 --> 00:17:53.720
going to be like
on campus and get

00:17:53.720 --> 00:17:56.855
to experience working with
different faculty and students.

00:17:59.700 --> 00:18:02.400
And beyond using the
VR for admissions,

00:18:02.400 --> 00:18:04.710
we're seeing professors
like Adam Blumenthal

00:18:04.710 --> 00:18:07.830
from Brown University
capture historical sites

00:18:07.830 --> 00:18:11.460
using Google's Jump camera,
and then marking those videos

00:18:11.460 --> 00:18:13.590
and 360 photos up
using in Tilt Brush

00:18:13.590 --> 00:18:16.890
and using tools
like Blocks and Poly

00:18:16.890 --> 00:18:22.520
to vividly recreate important
historical moments in history

00:18:22.520 --> 00:18:24.590
like the Gaspee Affair,
which happened off

00:18:24.590 --> 00:18:26.600
the coast of Rhode Island.

00:18:26.600 --> 00:18:28.190
It was a dramatic
event in the lead-up

00:18:28.190 --> 00:18:30.380
to the American Revolution.

00:18:30.380 --> 00:18:33.830
Students can now walk
through this virtual tour

00:18:33.830 --> 00:18:37.850
and experience a
preserved part of history.

00:18:37.850 --> 00:18:40.070
But not all faculty
are like Adam

00:18:40.070 --> 00:18:43.590
and know how to build
immersive content.

00:18:43.590 --> 00:18:46.820
So to help faculty and
students get started,

00:18:46.820 --> 00:18:49.680
we created a free VR
video course for anyone

00:18:49.680 --> 00:18:51.160
to be able to take.

00:18:51.160 --> 00:18:56.150
And we'll also be launching
an AR course this summer.

00:18:56.150 --> 00:18:59.300
We've also provided schools
with sample projects

00:18:59.300 --> 00:19:02.360
to help them get inspired for
how they can build experiences

00:19:02.360 --> 00:19:05.160
using VR and AR.

00:19:05.160 --> 00:19:07.560
And we've also established
a hardware loan program

00:19:07.560 --> 00:19:10.529
so that schools can apply and
get the necessary hardware

00:19:10.529 --> 00:19:12.570
to help them get started
on their first projects.

00:19:15.360 --> 00:19:18.210
Since launching the VR video
course and the hardware loan

00:19:18.210 --> 00:19:22.590
program this past fall, we've
received really positive

00:19:22.590 --> 00:19:24.090
feedback from
students, like Michael

00:19:24.090 --> 00:19:26.130
here, who have actually
taken the course.

00:19:28.960 --> 00:19:30.640
And one thing that
we're seeing is

00:19:30.640 --> 00:19:33.550
that more and more
students like Michael

00:19:33.550 --> 00:19:37.490
are going online to
pursue an education.

00:19:37.490 --> 00:19:44.730
In fact, 32% of students took
an online course just last year.

00:19:44.730 --> 00:19:49.330
This is a really
powerful notion--

00:19:49.330 --> 00:19:52.130
that your access to
a great education

00:19:52.130 --> 00:19:56.950
is no longer dependent on your
geographic proximity to one

00:19:56.950 --> 00:20:00.475
or dependent on having all
day, in-person classes.

00:20:03.300 --> 00:20:05.610
Imagine if you wanted to
pursue a career in, let's say,

00:20:05.610 --> 00:20:09.420
nursing, and you had to take
a set of prerequisite courses

00:20:09.420 --> 00:20:11.340
like biology.

00:20:11.340 --> 00:20:15.210
And your closest university
is 200 miles away.

00:20:15.210 --> 00:20:17.520
You might decide it's
worth it, and so you go

00:20:17.520 --> 00:20:19.921
and you look up the courses
that are being offered.

00:20:19.921 --> 00:20:21.337
And you realize
that biology class

00:20:21.337 --> 00:20:24.810
is offered Mondays, Wednesdays,
and Fridays from 1:00

00:20:24.810 --> 00:20:26.260
to 4:00 PM.

00:20:26.260 --> 00:20:29.430
But you have a full time job.

00:20:29.430 --> 00:20:32.630
You're probably not likely
to register for that class.

00:20:32.630 --> 00:20:35.690
And you might also consider a
different career opportunity

00:20:35.690 --> 00:20:39.500
that allows you
more flexibility.

00:20:39.500 --> 00:20:42.380
Almost all degree
granting institutions

00:20:42.380 --> 00:20:44.600
offer courses online.

00:20:44.600 --> 00:20:48.290
But many popular courses
and degrees, like biology,

00:20:48.290 --> 00:20:51.970
require in-person
activities like labs.

00:20:51.970 --> 00:20:55.570
Because of this, schools either
don't offer those courses,

00:20:55.570 --> 00:20:58.960
ask students to pay
really high course fees,

00:20:58.960 --> 00:21:02.500
or ask remote students
to drive hours to attend

00:21:02.500 --> 00:21:05.100
these in-person activities.

00:21:05.100 --> 00:21:07.800
It turns out this doesn't scale.

00:21:07.800 --> 00:21:10.080
But we know we
have the technology

00:21:10.080 --> 00:21:13.930
to enable these experiences.

00:21:13.930 --> 00:21:15.880
And that's why
we're excited today

00:21:15.880 --> 00:21:19.000
to announce that in partnership
with Labster, a science

00:21:19.000 --> 00:21:22.660
education company in Denmark,
we have removed the physical lab

00:21:22.660 --> 00:21:25.600
requirements to complete
an online biology

00:21:25.600 --> 00:21:27.940
degree using virtual reality.

00:21:27.940 --> 00:21:32.152
[APPLAUSE]

00:21:34.970 --> 00:21:39.200
Schools will now be able to
truly offer an online biology

00:21:39.200 --> 00:21:40.600
degree.

00:21:40.600 --> 00:21:44.300
The 30 labs can fully
simulate real-world outcomes

00:21:44.300 --> 00:21:48.560
using advanced simulations
and mathematical equations all

00:21:48.560 --> 00:21:50.005
built on the Daydream platform.

00:21:52.830 --> 00:21:55.050
These labs are
economically efficient,

00:21:55.050 --> 00:21:58.650
as the cost of the VR headset
and the content for the labs

00:21:58.650 --> 00:22:01.550
is still cheaper than
the years of lab fees.

00:22:01.550 --> 00:22:04.470
And it provides scale to a
growing number of students

00:22:04.470 --> 00:22:06.630
that are pursuing
courses online who

00:22:06.630 --> 00:22:11.480
previously were left out because
of geographic constraints.

00:22:11.480 --> 00:22:13.970
Students are also able
to have unlimited lab

00:22:13.970 --> 00:22:17.810
time, which is something that
many schools can't offer today.

00:22:17.810 --> 00:22:20.270
And as one student
put it, I no longer

00:22:20.270 --> 00:22:23.560
have to worry about
having a bad TA.

00:22:23.560 --> 00:22:26.680
Students are also able to
engage on a molecular level

00:22:26.680 --> 00:22:31.770
within these labs, which
is impossible today.

00:22:31.770 --> 00:22:33.630
And we're really
excited to announce

00:22:33.630 --> 00:22:37.110
that the first university
that will be offering these VR

00:22:37.110 --> 00:22:39.810
labs to their students
is Arizona State

00:22:39.810 --> 00:22:43.480
University this fall.

00:22:43.480 --> 00:22:47.480
[APPLAUSE]

00:22:47.480 --> 00:22:49.880
And what's also exciting
is that these labs

00:22:49.880 --> 00:22:53.810
map to AP and IB courses
for K-12 schools,

00:22:53.810 --> 00:22:55.970
so schools that want to
supplement their existing

00:22:55.970 --> 00:22:58.880
curriculum with these VR labs
can go ahead and do that.

00:22:58.880 --> 00:23:02.720
And for those schools that
can't afford creating a whole VR

00:23:02.720 --> 00:23:05.750
laboratory in their school,
they can offer these VR labs

00:23:05.750 --> 00:23:07.650
as a replacement.

00:23:07.650 --> 00:23:11.400
Labster also connects the
lab progress with major LMS

00:23:11.400 --> 00:23:13.620
systems, including
Google Classroom, which

00:23:13.620 --> 00:23:15.620
will be integrated this fall.

00:23:15.620 --> 00:23:17.610
And it allows teachers
to actually track

00:23:17.610 --> 00:23:20.130
the progress of students
throughout these VR labs.

00:23:22.940 --> 00:23:26.330
Labster has been able to help
reduce all of the laboratory

00:23:26.330 --> 00:23:28.880
costs for schools by
virtualizing hundreds

00:23:28.880 --> 00:23:31.130
of machines and equipment.

00:23:31.130 --> 00:23:35.404
I'm not sure what this
HPLC or the PCR is,

00:23:35.404 --> 00:23:37.070
but I'm pretty sure
I could do something

00:23:37.070 --> 00:23:38.765
fun with that fermenter.

00:23:41.620 --> 00:23:44.860
We think this is the
beginning of something big.

00:23:44.860 --> 00:23:48.010
What better way to use
the power of the VR

00:23:48.010 --> 00:23:51.190
than to offer a
powerful education?

00:23:51.190 --> 00:23:53.570
And with that, I'll hand it
off to my colleague Brit, who

00:23:53.570 --> 00:23:54.986
is going to talk
a little bit more

00:23:54.986 --> 00:23:58.710
about how VR is being used
in the classroom and beyond.

00:23:58.710 --> 00:24:03.130
[APPLAUSE]

00:24:03.130 --> 00:24:04.750
BRITTANY MENNUTI:
Thanks so much, Jen.

00:24:04.750 --> 00:24:06.882
Programs like Labster
got us thinking,

00:24:06.882 --> 00:24:08.590
how could we scale
this kind of immersive

00:24:08.590 --> 00:24:10.300
learning to more people?

00:24:10.300 --> 00:24:13.510
And how can we make it easier
to create this kind of content?

00:24:13.510 --> 00:24:15.910
Now we all know that most of
us don't have the expertise

00:24:15.910 --> 00:24:18.820
to recreate a $1 million
laboratory in VR.

00:24:18.820 --> 00:24:21.700
But we also know that many
of us have things to teach

00:24:21.700 --> 00:24:23.230
and stories to tell.

00:24:23.230 --> 00:24:25.510
And since the earliest
days of Expeditions,

00:24:25.510 --> 00:24:28.180
both teachers and students
have asked for the ability

00:24:28.180 --> 00:24:29.650
to create their own.

00:24:29.650 --> 00:24:31.150
So we started to
think about what

00:24:31.150 --> 00:24:35.240
it would be like to make it
easier to create VR content.

00:24:35.240 --> 00:24:38.170
That's why, in January,
we launched a beta

00:24:38.170 --> 00:24:41.350
for students and teachers to
make their own Expeditions.

00:24:41.350 --> 00:24:44.020
In partnership with Ricoh,
we outfitted students

00:24:44.020 --> 00:24:48.880
in schools all over the globe
with Ricoh Theta 360 cameras

00:24:48.880 --> 00:24:52.600
and kits of Chromebooks,
cardboards, phones, tripods,

00:24:52.600 --> 00:24:55.840
everything they needed to
create their own Expeditions.

00:24:55.840 --> 00:24:57.970
We encourage them to
use the theme love

00:24:57.970 --> 00:24:59.800
where you live so
they could showcase

00:24:59.800 --> 00:25:02.050
their communities to other
schools participating

00:25:02.050 --> 00:25:03.500
in the program.

00:25:03.500 --> 00:25:05.470
Let's take a look at
the experience of one

00:25:05.470 --> 00:25:07.750
of these schools in
Lancaster, Pennsylvania

00:25:07.750 --> 00:25:09.056
with this quick video.

00:25:09.056 --> 00:25:09.930
[VIDEO PLAYBACK]

00:25:09.930 --> 00:25:12.100
- I was born and raised
here in Lancaster.

00:25:12.100 --> 00:25:14.090
- It is definitely a
big farming community.

00:25:14.090 --> 00:25:16.650
- You see family farms
everywhere you go.

00:25:16.650 --> 00:25:19.860
- And I think it's really cool
that we have this opportunity

00:25:19.860 --> 00:25:23.331
to share our way of life.

00:25:23.331 --> 00:25:25.330
- How we're going to do
this is using a new tool

00:25:25.330 --> 00:25:26.480
called Tour Creator.

00:25:26.480 --> 00:25:28.270
- It's an interactive,
easy to use

00:25:28.270 --> 00:25:31.540
tool that allows our students
to create rich, 360 degree

00:25:31.540 --> 00:25:32.770
experiences.

00:25:32.770 --> 00:25:35.500
- You will see the photos that
the ag department and the art

00:25:35.500 --> 00:25:37.850
department have supplied.

00:25:37.850 --> 00:25:41.380
- Add a title and
description, click on that,

00:25:41.380 --> 00:25:43.180
and then it'll bring
up the street view.

00:25:43.180 --> 00:25:46.840
We can plug that
into the actual tour.

00:25:46.840 --> 00:25:50.260
- It will definitely inspire
me to show more of Lancaster.

00:25:50.260 --> 00:25:53.200
And hopefully it'll inspire
people to do the same.

00:25:53.200 --> 00:25:55.990
- And it's wonderful that we can
have our students interacting

00:25:55.990 --> 00:25:57.730
with all of these
other students' stories

00:25:57.730 --> 00:25:58.970
across the globe.

00:25:58.970 --> 00:26:01.380
- This is Chicago's Little
Village neighborhood.

00:26:01.380 --> 00:26:03.160
- That's very close
living quarters,

00:26:03.160 --> 00:26:05.620
very different from around here.

00:26:05.620 --> 00:26:07.540
- We were just looking
at the one from Bali.

00:26:07.540 --> 00:26:10.907
Their classes are
basically outside.

00:26:10.907 --> 00:26:12.490
- I really thought
that that was neat.

00:26:12.490 --> 00:26:14.656
- Everybody's different on
the way they like living.

00:26:14.656 --> 00:26:16.615
- And every place
has a unique story.

00:26:21.190 --> 00:26:22.630
[END PLAYBACK]

00:26:22.630 --> 00:26:25.990
[APPLAUSE]

00:26:25.990 --> 00:26:28.000
BRITTANY MENNUTI: Now
Penn Manor high school

00:26:28.000 --> 00:26:29.920
is just one of
hundreds of schools

00:26:29.920 --> 00:26:32.740
around the globe that have
participated in this program.

00:26:32.740 --> 00:26:35.770
For example, Spry Links
Community High School

00:26:35.770 --> 00:26:39.070
in Chicago made an amazing tour
of Chicago's Little Village,

00:26:39.070 --> 00:26:41.290
showcasing all the
awesome arts and culture

00:26:41.290 --> 00:26:43.480
the Village has to offer.

00:26:43.480 --> 00:26:46.700
And the Green School in
Bali made this amazing tour

00:26:46.700 --> 00:26:48.410
that showcases
other students what

00:26:48.410 --> 00:26:51.740
it's like to get an education
being completely immersed

00:26:51.740 --> 00:26:52.700
in nature.

00:26:52.700 --> 00:26:56.780
That's right, these students
actually learn outside.

00:26:56.780 --> 00:26:59.180
And another school
in Valdemoro, Spain

00:26:59.180 --> 00:27:02.620
created a tour of all the
historic sites in Valdemoro

00:27:02.620 --> 00:27:05.690
to show other schools what
their community was like.

00:27:05.690 --> 00:27:09.290
Now these are just a few
examples of over 300 schools

00:27:09.290 --> 00:27:11.420
that have participated
in this program.

00:27:11.420 --> 00:27:14.000
And thanks to them, we
now have a ton of feedback

00:27:14.000 --> 00:27:17.100
about what it's like to
create your own Expeditions.

00:27:17.100 --> 00:27:19.110
And as we were thinking
through that feedback,

00:27:19.110 --> 00:27:21.660
it occurred to us that when
it comes to this concept

00:27:21.660 --> 00:27:25.440
that Ben mentioned earlier of
transforming abstract concepts

00:27:25.440 --> 00:27:28.890
to real ones, perhaps
Expeditions like content

00:27:28.890 --> 00:27:32.350
could be useful
outside the classroom.

00:27:32.350 --> 00:27:34.794
Let's take the example
of buying a home.

00:27:34.794 --> 00:27:36.210
When you're
purchasing a home, you

00:27:36.210 --> 00:27:38.040
might consult a whole
bunch of resources

00:27:38.040 --> 00:27:41.160
like photos,
brochures, blueprints,

00:27:41.160 --> 00:27:45.840
floor plans, in order
to inform your decision.

00:27:45.840 --> 00:27:47.790
Now we can imagine
how being immersed

00:27:47.790 --> 00:27:50.100
in a virtual tour of
that home would give you

00:27:50.100 --> 00:27:52.020
a much better
understanding of what it's

00:27:52.020 --> 00:27:53.511
like to actually live there.

00:27:56.100 --> 00:27:58.350
That's why we're
super excited today

00:27:58.350 --> 00:28:01.800
to announce the launch of Tour
Creator, a web application that

00:28:01.800 --> 00:28:06.970
gives anyone the power
to create VR content.

00:28:06.970 --> 00:28:11.080
As of today, students,
teachers, businesses, employees,

00:28:11.080 --> 00:28:14.860
folks like you and me, we can
all create our own VR tours

00:28:14.860 --> 00:28:17.261
and easily share them
anywhere on the web.

00:28:20.150 --> 00:28:22.580
When you go to Tour
Creator, you start out

00:28:22.580 --> 00:28:26.790
by starting a new tour
or picking up on a draft.

00:28:26.790 --> 00:28:29.870
And then you add some basic
metadata, things like a title,

00:28:29.870 --> 00:28:34.560
description, category,
and a cover photo.

00:28:34.560 --> 00:28:36.590
And then you fill
your tour with scenes.

00:28:36.590 --> 00:28:39.980
Scenes are made possible
through the use of 360 photos.

00:28:39.980 --> 00:28:42.810
Now if you have your
own 360 photos, awesome.

00:28:42.810 --> 00:28:45.110
You can upload them in
just a couple of clicks.

00:28:45.110 --> 00:28:46.940
But if you don't, have no fear.

00:28:46.940 --> 00:28:48.840
We've integrated directly
with Street View.

00:28:48.840 --> 00:28:51.230
So you can take advantage
of the massive library

00:28:51.230 --> 00:28:56.390
of 360 photos already
available in Google Maps.

00:28:56.390 --> 00:28:58.340
Once you add your
scenes, you add what

00:28:58.340 --> 00:29:00.140
we call points of interest.

00:29:00.140 --> 00:29:02.000
These are essentially
areas of importance

00:29:02.000 --> 00:29:03.380
that you'd like to highlight.

00:29:03.380 --> 00:29:05.480
And you can add a little
bit of text information

00:29:05.480 --> 00:29:08.480
to inform your viewer.

00:29:08.480 --> 00:29:10.640
You can also enrich
these points of interest

00:29:10.640 --> 00:29:13.130
with other media like 2D photos.

00:29:13.130 --> 00:29:15.710
And in the future, we'll be
adding narration and ambient

00:29:15.710 --> 00:29:20.394
audio to help your viewers feel
like they're actually there.

00:29:20.394 --> 00:29:22.060
Now when you're done
creating your tour,

00:29:22.060 --> 00:29:23.326
you publish it to the web.

00:29:23.326 --> 00:29:24.700
You can make it
public for anyone

00:29:24.700 --> 00:29:29.510
to see or unlisted so only
those with the link can see it.

00:29:29.510 --> 00:29:31.040
And when you publish
it to the web,

00:29:31.040 --> 00:29:33.500
you actually publish it to Poly.

00:29:33.500 --> 00:29:35.270
If you're not
familiar with Poly,

00:29:35.270 --> 00:29:38.000
Poly is Google's
library of 3D content

00:29:38.000 --> 00:29:39.800
launched late last year.

00:29:39.800 --> 00:29:43.490
Previously, Poly had things
like 3D models, 3D sketches,

00:29:43.490 --> 00:29:47.390
and as of today, Poly will
also contain 3D experiences

00:29:47.390 --> 00:29:49.790
in the form of tours.

00:29:49.790 --> 00:29:52.100
And this is where the true
beauty of this product

00:29:52.100 --> 00:29:53.180
comes in.

00:29:53.180 --> 00:29:55.520
Because you're publishing
your tour to the web,

00:29:55.520 --> 00:29:58.460
all you need to do to
share it is share a URL.

00:29:58.460 --> 00:30:01.250
So that means you can view
your tour in 2D on desktop

00:30:01.250 --> 00:30:02.960
or on your laptop computer.

00:30:02.960 --> 00:30:05.895
You can text a link to your
tour to a friend or colleague.

00:30:05.895 --> 00:30:07.520
They can load it on
their mobile device

00:30:07.520 --> 00:30:10.610
and simply use Magic
Window to experience it,

00:30:10.610 --> 00:30:12.650
or they can tap an
Enter VR button,

00:30:12.650 --> 00:30:15.170
put it in a Google
Cardboard, and immediately be

00:30:15.170 --> 00:30:19.080
immersed in the tour
that you just created.

00:30:19.080 --> 00:30:21.540
Now you may be wondering,
what is this magic?

00:30:21.540 --> 00:30:22.970
I thought when it
came to VR, you

00:30:22.970 --> 00:30:24.590
have to install a
bunch of apps, get

00:30:24.590 --> 00:30:26.992
some really expensive hardware.

00:30:26.992 --> 00:30:29.450
Well, this is all made powerful
through a technology called

00:30:29.450 --> 00:30:32.300
WebXR that you might have
heard about at the previous I/O

00:30:32.300 --> 00:30:33.840
session.

00:30:33.840 --> 00:30:35.810
WebXR means that
you can experience

00:30:35.810 --> 00:30:39.292
VR content in your browser
using any VR headset.

00:30:42.270 --> 00:30:44.640
Another beautiful thing
about publishing these tours

00:30:44.640 --> 00:30:48.240
to the web is that you
can easily embed them.

00:30:48.240 --> 00:30:50.522
Just go to Poly, click
on a Share button,

00:30:50.522 --> 00:30:52.230
and you'll get an
iFrame snippet that you

00:30:52.230 --> 00:30:55.015
can put in any blog or website.

00:30:55.015 --> 00:30:56.390
And when you think
about it, this

00:30:56.390 --> 00:30:59.069
can be truly transformational
for business.

00:30:59.069 --> 00:31:00.860
Let's go back to the
example of real estate

00:31:00.860 --> 00:31:02.270
that I mentioned earlier.

00:31:02.270 --> 00:31:04.280
Imagine a future where
instead of seeing

00:31:04.280 --> 00:31:08.240
a series of 2D photos on a real
estate listing online, instead

00:31:08.240 --> 00:31:10.370
you saw a virtual
tour of that property

00:31:10.370 --> 00:31:13.630
that you were about to buy.

00:31:13.630 --> 00:31:15.460
Now you may be
thinking, OK, maybe

00:31:15.460 --> 00:31:19.270
businesses will use this thing,
but will they actually use it?

00:31:19.270 --> 00:31:21.994
Well, to validate that we were
building the right product,

00:31:21.994 --> 00:31:23.410
we actually partnered
with a bunch

00:31:23.410 --> 00:31:25.810
of companies across
many verticals

00:31:25.810 --> 00:31:27.640
to get their feedback
before we launched.

00:31:27.640 --> 00:31:29.530
And we want to share
with you a few examples

00:31:29.530 --> 00:31:32.610
of what they've created.

00:31:32.610 --> 00:31:35.490
Time Out New York has
been using to Tour Creator

00:31:35.490 --> 00:31:38.310
to create tours of having
the best day ever in New York

00:31:38.310 --> 00:31:41.670
City, everything
from Central Park

00:31:41.670 --> 00:31:46.040
to Lincoln Center to the
New York Public Library.

00:31:46.040 --> 00:31:48.440
Imagine It Done,
a company devoted

00:31:48.440 --> 00:31:52.550
to helping its clients, like
style icon Lindsay Lane,

00:31:52.550 --> 00:31:55.850
organize their lives
and their closets,

00:31:55.850 --> 00:31:59.630
has been using Tour Creator
to showcase their expertise.

00:31:59.630 --> 00:32:01.220
Now I don't know
about you, but if I

00:32:01.220 --> 00:32:02.655
had that many
pairs of shoes, I'd

00:32:02.655 --> 00:32:04.280
probably want to see
a tour of how they

00:32:04.280 --> 00:32:05.537
were going to organize them.

00:32:08.950 --> 00:32:13.420
REA Group, owner of
realestate.com.au, the number

00:32:13.420 --> 00:32:15.970
one place for
property in Australia,

00:32:15.970 --> 00:32:17.800
has been using Tour
Creator to create

00:32:17.800 --> 00:32:21.030
tours to embed in both their
website and their mobile apps

00:32:21.030 --> 00:32:21.880
soon.

00:32:21.880 --> 00:32:24.280
As they've mentioned
to us, Tour Creator

00:32:24.280 --> 00:32:26.530
allows their users to
explore their properties

00:32:26.530 --> 00:32:29.210
from wherever they are.

00:32:29.210 --> 00:32:31.400
And of course, we've
seen broad applications

00:32:31.400 --> 00:32:34.250
for this technology in
enterprise training.

00:32:34.250 --> 00:32:36.650
KLM Airlines has been
using Tour Creator

00:32:36.650 --> 00:32:39.080
to save lots of money
on training costs

00:32:39.080 --> 00:32:41.900
by acclimating their flight
crews to the aircraft

00:32:41.900 --> 00:32:45.380
before they even
set foot inside.

00:32:45.380 --> 00:32:49.850
Now it's one thing to hear
about these use cases from us.

00:32:49.850 --> 00:32:52.830
It's another thing to hear about
them direct from the source.

00:32:52.830 --> 00:32:54.680
So let's cut to a
quick video where

00:32:54.680 --> 00:32:56.020
we'll share their feedback.

00:32:56.020 --> 00:32:56.880
[VIDEO PLAYBACK]

00:32:56.880 --> 00:32:58.650
- Time Out has always
been about helping

00:32:58.650 --> 00:33:00.180
people explore their city.

00:33:00.180 --> 00:33:02.740
And Tour Creator
helps us do just that.

00:33:02.740 --> 00:33:06.120
It's really going to help
us be able to innovate more

00:33:06.120 --> 00:33:08.730
in the digital world and
really create new content.

00:33:08.730 --> 00:33:11.056
We get some cool 360
photos, and we just

00:33:11.056 --> 00:33:12.430
pop them right
into Tour Creator.

00:33:12.430 --> 00:33:14.610
We pull images,
information, fun facts,

00:33:14.610 --> 00:33:16.950
things to do in that area,
anything you could really

00:33:16.950 --> 00:33:17.910
possibly need to know.

00:33:17.910 --> 00:33:19.850
We have some really
cool tours through that.

00:33:19.850 --> 00:33:22.450
- We can use Tour
Creator to virtually see

00:33:22.450 --> 00:33:25.650
the aircraft, which means that
we can take the people whenever

00:33:25.650 --> 00:33:28.560
they want and wherever they
want with virtual reality.

00:33:28.560 --> 00:33:30.060
And that saves quite
a lot of money.

00:33:30.060 --> 00:33:31.770
- Spectrum Designs
is a full service,

00:33:31.770 --> 00:33:33.510
customer-powered
business with a mission,

00:33:33.510 --> 00:33:36.090
to provide purposeful work
opportunities and authentic

00:33:36.090 --> 00:33:38.570
vocational experiences to
individuals with autism.

00:33:38.570 --> 00:33:42.030
Tour Creator has
allowed us to habituate

00:33:42.030 --> 00:33:44.545
our staff and our
employees before they even

00:33:44.545 --> 00:33:45.420
come in the building.

00:33:45.420 --> 00:33:48.180
Before they take one
step over the threshold

00:33:48.180 --> 00:33:49.770
into our building,
Tour Creator lets

00:33:49.770 --> 00:33:52.310
us show them exactly
what to expect

00:33:52.310 --> 00:33:56.250
to become acclimated to
the building, to the noise,

00:33:56.250 --> 00:33:57.600
to the machinery.

00:33:57.600 --> 00:34:00.820
- The Tour Creator tool
brings everything to life.

00:34:00.820 --> 00:34:02.730
Clients feel so
comfortable knowing

00:34:02.730 --> 00:34:04.200
what the spaces
are going to look

00:34:04.200 --> 00:34:06.770
like by seeing it through
this Tour Creator tool

00:34:06.770 --> 00:34:08.238
It's indispensable.

00:34:14.998 --> 00:34:15.498
[APPLAUSE]

00:34:15.498 --> 00:34:19.370
Thank you, thank you.

00:34:19.370 --> 00:34:22.199
We are super excited to launch
Tour Creator to all of you

00:34:22.199 --> 00:34:24.389
today and can't wait
to see all the tours

00:34:24.389 --> 00:34:26.100
that you're going to create.

00:34:26.100 --> 00:34:28.320
Later this year we'll be
introducing the ability

00:34:28.320 --> 00:34:31.320
to add these tours directly
to the Expeditions app,

00:34:31.320 --> 00:34:33.159
so stay tuned for that.

00:34:33.159 --> 00:34:34.860
And with that, I'll
pass it back off

00:34:34.860 --> 00:34:38.340
to Ben for some closing remarks.

00:34:38.340 --> 00:34:42.040
[APPLAUSE]

00:34:42.040 --> 00:34:44.460
BENJAMIN SCHROM: Thanks, Brit.

00:34:44.460 --> 00:34:45.690
So there you have it.

00:34:45.690 --> 00:34:48.870
A new powerful AR mode
in Google Expeditions

00:34:48.870 --> 00:34:51.929
that packs a universe of places
and things in your pocket

00:34:51.929 --> 00:34:54.350
and brings them into your
classroom, onto your desk,

00:34:54.350 --> 00:34:56.200
right on top of your textbook.

00:34:56.200 --> 00:34:59.510
A wholly online biology degree
from Labster and Daydream

00:34:59.510 --> 00:35:02.040
that uses the power
of immersive computing

00:35:02.040 --> 00:35:04.200
to make access to
a great education

00:35:04.200 --> 00:35:07.380
not reliant on your
geographic proximity to one.

00:35:07.380 --> 00:35:10.080
And finally, Tour Creator,
a simple, powerful tool

00:35:10.080 --> 00:35:13.050
that makes creating immersive
content accessible to anyone

00:35:13.050 --> 00:35:15.838
straight from their web browser.

00:35:15.838 --> 00:35:19.385
I want to close on a note
about why this is so important.

00:35:19.385 --> 00:35:21.510
I can't really think about
education and technology

00:35:21.510 --> 00:35:24.610
without thinking about
this guy, Seymour Papert.

00:35:24.610 --> 00:35:26.320
20 years ago, he
observed that it

00:35:26.320 --> 00:35:29.320
might be time to reconsider our
fundamental conception of what

00:35:29.320 --> 00:35:30.610
a literal person--

00:35:30.610 --> 00:35:34.600
I mean-- sorry, not a literal
person, a literate person.

00:35:34.600 --> 00:35:37.810
For hundreds of years, the
primary way we've taught things

00:35:37.810 --> 00:35:41.710
or learned things in school
was via the written word

00:35:41.710 --> 00:35:44.830
or symbols, reading,
writing them.

00:35:44.830 --> 00:35:47.800
And while these are
obviously critical skills,

00:35:47.800 --> 00:35:50.460
for many people they're really
challenging entry points.

00:35:50.460 --> 00:35:54.074
They're about as
abstract as things get.

00:35:54.074 --> 00:35:55.740
We have an opportunity
to use technology

00:35:55.740 --> 00:35:59.610
to lower these barriers to
make learning richer, less

00:35:59.610 --> 00:36:01.950
abstract, to make all
that important reading

00:36:01.950 --> 00:36:03.660
and writing that
we do be augmented

00:36:03.660 --> 00:36:06.420
with the actual parts of the
world that they refer to.

00:36:06.420 --> 00:36:09.050
And we can use photospheres,
sounds, 3D objects,

00:36:09.050 --> 00:36:12.950
simulations, all the formats
immersive computing enables,

00:36:12.950 --> 00:36:14.810
to give learners
more effective entry

00:36:14.810 --> 00:36:19.234
points into complicated
subjects and ideas.

00:36:19.234 --> 00:36:21.150
So here's a quote from
one of the teachers who

00:36:21.150 --> 00:36:22.840
participated in
Exhibitions AR beta,

00:36:22.840 --> 00:36:25.214
and it really resonated with us.

00:36:25.214 --> 00:36:26.630
She refers to
something I remember

00:36:26.630 --> 00:36:30.260
seeing every day when I was
a teacher over 10 years ago.

00:36:30.260 --> 00:36:32.540
Many very, very
smart students, they

00:36:32.540 --> 00:36:34.796
might not bring extensive
textual literacy

00:36:34.796 --> 00:36:36.170
to their learning
from the get go

00:36:36.170 --> 00:36:37.961
for a bunch of different
reasons-- language

00:36:37.961 --> 00:36:41.610
barriers, their particular
educational background.

00:36:41.610 --> 00:36:43.370
But we traditionally
treat this like it's

00:36:43.370 --> 00:36:45.330
a blocker to their learning.

00:36:45.330 --> 00:36:46.760
We don't have to.

00:36:46.760 --> 00:36:50.090
We all, you all, we
all have an opportunity

00:36:50.090 --> 00:36:53.030
to use all these
tools, VR and AR,

00:36:53.030 --> 00:36:55.850
to give them a more natural,
more inherently visual entry

00:36:55.850 --> 00:36:58.940
point to really important
ideas and learning.

00:36:58.940 --> 00:37:01.130
And as this teacher
says, we can help

00:37:01.130 --> 00:37:03.080
to level the playing field.

00:37:03.080 --> 00:37:05.160
So thanks very much.

00:37:05.160 --> 00:37:07.920
