That's right. You should never far-future cache the manifest

00:00:03.450 --> 00:00:06.610
file itself. Cat videos, of course, never go out

00:00:06.610 --> 00:00:09.590
of style, so that's fine, but if you far-future

00:00:09.590 --> 00:00:12.450
cache the manifest file, you're going to have a really

00:00:12.450 --> 00:00:15.130
hard time getting the user's system to update the

00:00:15.130 --> 00:00:18.310
cache. Your users will get locked into that set of

00:00:18.310 --> 00:00:22.230
cache files. Unless the user specifically goes in, clears

00:00:22.230 --> 00:00:26.721
out their cache, the manifest file will never be re-downloaded.
