A lot of girls,

00:00:01.001 --> 00:00:03.003
like, don't eat for two days
if they wanna have anal sex.

00:00:03.003 --> 00:00:04.630
Two whole days for anal?!

00:00:04.630 --> 00:00:05.631
It's not worth it.
I won't do it.

00:00:05.631 --> 00:00:06.965
-What the hell?
-No... two days?

00:00:06.965 --> 00:00:08.842
-I won't do it, and I love...
-Who has the strength

00:00:08.842 --> 00:00:10.594
for anal after you've starved
yourself? You need to...

00:00:10.594 --> 00:00:12.596
- That's a good...
- Adriana Chechik?

00:00:12.596 --> 00:00:14.223
Oh, that's a good point.

00:00:14.223 --> 00:00:16.350
Yeah, you, you do, you...

00:00:16.350 --> 00:00:17.684
A lot of girls...

00:00:17.684 --> 00:00:19.436
I remember one of
my friends was like,

00:00:19.436 --> 00:00:21.104
"I'm having anal tonight
for the first time.

00:00:21.104 --> 00:00:23.649
I haven't... I've been drinking
clear soup for two days."

00:00:23.649 --> 00:00:24.983
I'm like, "That sucks.
I will not..." 

00:00:24.983 --> 00:00:26.443
Is it -- Ramadan for your ass?

00:00:26.443 --> 00:00:28.987
Yeah. 
(laughter)

00:00:28.987 --> 00:00:31.573
If you could just time your 
anal around Ramadan...

00:00:31.573 --> 00:00:33.033
-Yeah. 
-...that would actually be 

00:00:33.033 --> 00:00:34.034
really good.

Myka Fox is here,
a friend of the show,

00:00:40.832 --> 00:00:43.126
a hilarious bitch,
my kinda doppelganger.

00:00:43.126 --> 00:00:47.256
I'm, you know, tooting
my own horn by saying that.

00:00:47.256 --> 00:00:47.881
(chuckles)

00:00:47.881 --> 00:00:49.466
Let's toot both horns,
let's toot a few.

00:00:49.466 --> 00:00:50.050
Yeah, like...

00:00:50.050 --> 00:00:50.801
Is that what we were just
talking about?

00:00:50.801 --> 00:00:52.344
Yeah.
(laughter)

00:00:52.344 --> 00:00:53.804
We were just talking
about farts off-air, guys.

00:00:53.804 --> 00:00:55.222
We're gonna get
back into it, but, uh...

00:00:55.222 --> 00:00:57.641
Myka has a weekly show,
"Live from Outer Space,"

00:00:57.641 --> 00:01:00.060
in Bushwick,
at the Cobra Club,

00:01:00.060 --> 00:01:01.561
if you're in New York City.

00:01:01.561 --> 00:01:03.313
Um, where is that?
What time... when is it?

00:01:03.313 --> 00:01:06.566
It's at 9:00 p.m.,
it's off the Jefferson L stop.

00:01:06.566 --> 00:01:08.568
Ian's gonna be on the next one.
-Yeah, Friday night.

00:01:08.568 --> 00:01:09.695
-What day of the week
are we looking at?

00:01:09.695 --> 00:01:11.071
That's a Friday night.
Every Friday night.

00:01:11.071 --> 00:01:12.364
Fridays nights, okay.

00:01:12.364 --> 00:01:14.032
-Best weekly in town.
-Oh, really?

00:01:14.032 --> 00:01:16.118
-Yeah, it's really fun.
-Very cool, very hip.

00:01:16.118 --> 00:01:17.119
-Oh...
-Yeah.

00:01:17.119 --> 00:01:18.245
If I call it cool.

00:01:18.245 --> 00:01:19.579
-I'm in town this Friday.
-Oh...

00:01:19.579 --> 00:01:20.789
-You're on it this Friday?
-Yeah.

00:01:20.789 --> 00:01:21.832
-Come do it.
-Maybe I'll stop in 

00:01:21.832 --> 00:01:23.667
and say "Hey."

00:01:23.667 --> 00:01:25.002
But I just
don't go to Brooklyn

00:01:25.002 --> 00:01:26.753
ever, ever, ever now.

00:01:26.753 --> 00:01:28.213
Come to Brooklyn! Yeah!

00:01:28.213 --> 00:01:30.590
But I'm gonna be doing spots
in the city on Friday night.

00:01:30.590 --> 00:01:31.591
-You know, like,...
-Ah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

00:01:31.591 --> 00:01:32.843
I'm trying to, like, really
stack 'em up.

00:01:32.843 --> 00:01:34.386
-Yeah. 
-Get ready for my special

00:01:34.386 --> 00:01:36.054
taping, which is May 22nd,
everyone.

00:01:36.054 --> 00:01:37.931
-Ooh.
-May 22nd. Make sure that

00:01:37.931 --> 00:01:39.182
you're in Los Angeles May 22nd.

00:01:39.182 --> 00:01:40.600
Build a trip around it.

00:01:40.600 --> 00:01:42.185
I don't know
what day of the week it is,

00:01:42.185 --> 00:01:44.187
I think it's either
a Tuesday or a Wednesday,

00:01:44.187 --> 00:01:45.939
but May 22nd is the date

00:01:45.939 --> 00:01:48.275
that I'm taping my Netflix
special in Los Angeles,

00:01:48.275 --> 00:01:51.069
all details coming up, um,
soon as I can get 'em.

00:01:51.069 --> 00:01:52.321
It is a Wednesday.

00:01:52.321 --> 00:01:54.698
And we're gonna
have some fun and...

00:01:54.698 --> 00:01:56.199
there'll be two shows
to go to that night,

00:01:56.199 --> 00:01:57.868
tickets will be available,
they'll be free,

00:01:57.868 --> 00:02:00.329
uh, make sure
you make it out, but, um...

00:02:00.329 --> 00:02:03.457
So, Myka and Ian
are here, um...

00:02:03.457 --> 00:02:04.583
Yeah, how are you guys?
Good?

00:02:04.583 --> 00:02:06.043
-I'm good, yeah.

00:02:06.043 --> 00:02:07.961
Yeah, we were just talking
about farts off-air

00:02:07.961 --> 00:02:09.963
and discussing whether 
or not the sound of a fart

00:02:09.963 --> 00:02:12.716
is inspired by the butt cheeks
or inspired...

00:02:12.716 --> 00:02:15.093
like, your, your --
is like, "You know what?"

00:02:15.093 --> 00:02:17.012
-It has a muse.
-Yeah, yeah.

00:02:17.012 --> 00:02:18.472
(laughing)
It's Shakespearean.

00:02:18.472 --> 00:02:20.599
...uh, is caused
by butt cheeks or...

00:02:20.599 --> 00:02:22.726
-Flapping.
-It's the sphincter.

00:02:22.726 --> 00:02:23.852
Or the sphinct.

00:02:23.852 --> 00:02:25.145
The kind that's like, "Rrr..."

00:02:25.145 --> 00:02:26.813
is when the butt,
the butthole...

00:02:26.813 --> 00:02:28.190
What's your favorite
kinda fart?

00:02:28.190 --> 00:02:29.733
-The...
-Alone. When you're by yourself.

00:02:29.733 --> 00:02:31.777
-...straight up "Brrrn?"

00:02:31.777 --> 00:02:33.028
One that asks a question?

00:02:33.028 --> 00:02:34.112
(laughing)
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

00:02:34.112 --> 00:02:35.489
One that asks a question
that can't be answered.

00:02:35.489 --> 00:02:36.907
-Uh-huh. Yeah, yeah.
-You know?

00:02:36.907 --> 00:02:37.991
Like, one of those
existential questions.

00:02:37.991 --> 00:02:39.910
(laughing)
"Why are we here?"

00:02:39.910 --> 00:02:41.745
Yeah.
That kind of question.
Yeah, I like those too.

00:02:41.745 --> 00:02:44.706
Like a S... Socrates,
but for your butt?
"Mmm...?"

00:02:44.706 --> 00:02:46.124
Where you're just like,

00:02:46.124 --> 00:02:47.918
"Oh, someone's got
a little toot today."

00:02:47.918 --> 00:02:50.670
You're right.
I didn't think of it like that.

00:02:50.670 --> 00:02:52.964
"Well, when you say it
like that, --..."

00:02:52.964 --> 00:02:55.759
(laughing)
Yeah, I mean,
there are some...

00:02:55.759 --> 00:02:57.677
some where you're just like,

00:02:57.677 --> 00:03:01.139
"I'm so glad no one else
was around to...

00:03:01.139 --> 00:03:03.642
Like, I'm glad I didn't
let that one out like an SBD.

00:03:03.642 --> 00:03:05.936
You know, where you're like,
"Oh, it won't smell that bad,"

00:03:05.936 --> 00:03:08.063
and then
you're like, "Oh, dear."
Do you... yeah, do you ever think in your head,

00:03:08.063 --> 00:03:09.898
you're like, "I know this
isn't gonna smell..."

00:03:09.898 --> 00:03:11.274
Yes.
...and then you have to
start pointing

00:03:11.274 --> 00:03:13.360
to the...
kid on the train?

00:03:13.360 --> 00:03:16.279
Oh... oh, you, you do them...
Do you let 'em loose
on the train?

00:03:16.279 --> 00:03:18.573
Yeah, I have to, 'cause if
I don't, I get a stomachache.
You ha...

00:03:18.573 --> 00:03:20.033
What?
Oh, well, guess what?

00:03:20.033 --> 00:03:22.536
Screw you, Ian.
Suck it up, literally.

00:03:22.536 --> 00:03:24.371
It's a train!
The train stinks!

00:03:24.371 --> 00:03:26.790
I mean, unfairness,
if anyone farts on the train,

00:03:26.790 --> 00:03:28.708
they're probably gonna think
it's Ian.
That's a good point.

00:03:28.708 --> 00:03:30.627
Yeah, 'cause I look
like a fart.
You've gotten blamed

00:03:30.627 --> 00:03:32.462
for a lot of farts that
weren't your responsibility...

00:03:32.462 --> 00:03:34.214
I might as well
toss it out there.
...so now you might...

00:03:34.214 --> 00:03:35.924
might as well get 'em out.
You're like a fart
with a face.

00:03:35.924 --> 00:03:37.342
Yeah.
Yeah, yeah, that's so true.

00:03:37.342 --> 00:03:39.136
Thank you.
I'd be like, "That guy just...

00:03:39.136 --> 00:03:41.346
"That guy gets stomach issues
if he doesn't let 'em out...

00:03:41.346 --> 00:03:43.265
Yeah, people love farts,
so people love me
...so I'm gonna let him do it."

00:03:43.265 --> 00:03:44.641
By the way, you're not
some... this isn't

00:03:44.641 --> 00:03:47.394
some unique quality
that you possess

00:03:47.394 --> 00:03:50.522
because you get stomach
cramps if you don't fart.

00:03:50.522 --> 00:03:52.649
We all do,
but we hold them in.

00:03:52.649 --> 00:03:55.652
I mean, I was br... I was
being brutalized on the train

00:03:55.652 --> 00:03:57.404
by my own digestive system...

00:03:57.404 --> 00:03:59.823
Where?
...or on the, um,
on the plane yesterday.

00:03:59.823 --> 00:04:01.283
But I knew letting it out

00:04:01.283 --> 00:04:03.326
would make everyone suffer,
so I suffered

00:04:03.326 --> 00:04:05.036
silently.
So, why didn't you go
to the bathroom then?

00:04:05.036 --> 00:04:07.247
I did eventually, and, um...
Yeah.

00:04:07.247 --> 00:04:08.999
Yeah, and I let out, but,
like, you know, because...

00:04:08.999 --> 00:04:10.750
a, a lot of being on a plane

00:04:10.750 --> 00:04:12.586
is not being able to get up
and go to the bathroom.

00:04:12.586 --> 00:04:14.212
Right.
Either the people
next to you are sleeping

00:04:14.212 --> 00:04:17.007
and you're waiting on that,
or there's turbulence

00:04:17.007 --> 00:04:19.342
and they put the sign on,
and then you're the --

00:04:19.342 --> 00:04:21.303
who gets up and makes
a big commotion...

00:04:21.303 --> 00:04:22.762
Mm-hmm.
...or you're landing,
or you're...

00:04:22.762 --> 00:04:24.931
there's a lotta rules
when you fly...

00:04:24.931 --> 00:04:27.350
um, so you can't
time it perfectly,

00:04:27.350 --> 00:04:29.269
but I've let 'em sli...
I fall asleep

00:04:29.269 --> 00:04:30.520
and sometimes they slip out.

00:04:30.520 --> 00:04:32.647
It happens.
That's when it happens.

00:04:32.647 --> 00:04:34.107
And that's when it's like,
I feel so bad.

00:04:34.107 --> 00:04:36.485
Yeah.
And what do you do?
Do you... I don't...

00:04:36.485 --> 00:04:38.445
I just pretend to be asleep.
You're asleep.
How do you feel bad?

00:04:38.445 --> 00:04:39.821
Oh, you...
wait, wait, you're falling...
No, it'll,

00:04:39.821 --> 00:04:41.448
it'll wake me up.
(laughs)

00:04:41.448 --> 00:04:43.283
Do you...
What are you, a dog?
Yeah, yeah, totally.

00:04:43.283 --> 00:04:45.452
Oh, that's happened.
(laughing)

00:04:45.452 --> 00:04:47.537
I love that,
that's so funny.
I would, I get woken up because I...

00:04:47.537 --> 00:04:48.955
of the embarrassment
more than anything,

00:04:48.955 --> 00:04:50.582
'cause you just realize
where you are

00:04:50.582 --> 00:04:52.501
and who you've just
done this thing in front of.

00:04:52.501 --> 00:04:53.835
I don't have enough shame
for that.

00:04:53.835 --> 00:04:55.921
Ugh.
I don't think
that would wake me up.

00:04:55.921 --> 00:04:58.006
Oh, yeah.
You know, you know how parents,
when they have a new kid,

00:04:58.006 --> 00:05:00.717
they hand out candy with, like,
a little letter to, like...

00:05:00.717 --> 00:05:02.093
Oh, yeah, like on the plane?
"It's our son's first flight.

00:05:02.093 --> 00:05:03.553
He's gonna be yelling."

00:05:03.553 --> 00:05:05.096
I'm gonna be do that,
but for my stomachaches.

00:05:05.096 --> 00:05:07.849
Oh, my God,
you just have, um, uh...

00:05:07.849 --> 00:05:10.060
What, what could you give
someone to put over their face?

00:05:10.060 --> 00:05:12.312
Like, an air freshener?
Like, one of those sort of...
full masks?

00:05:12.312 --> 00:05:13.814
Like, one of those face masks,
but it's like...
Yeah.

00:05:13.814 --> 00:05:14.940
Yes!

00:05:14.940 --> 00:05:16.316
Yeah.
Oh, my God, that's so...

00:05:16.316 --> 00:05:18.151
and just quietly hand it
to everyone in your...

00:05:18.151 --> 00:05:19.653
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
like, behind you,
in front of you.

00:05:19.653 --> 00:05:21.238
"I had
a lot of coffee today."

00:05:21.238 --> 00:05:23.073
(laughter)
That is so funny.

00:05:23.073 --> 00:05:26.284
Oh, I was, like, putting down
some broccoli one...

00:05:26.284 --> 00:05:27.953
My mom, like,
made me all this broccoli,

00:05:27.953 --> 00:05:29.621
'cause I eat veggies
all the time, and I was...

00:05:29.621 --> 00:05:31.289
My dad was watching me
eat before a flight

00:05:31.289 --> 00:05:34.000
and he was like, "This is
a crime what you're do...

00:05:34.000 --> 00:05:35.919
(laughter)
...what you're loading up,
like, this is..."

00:05:35.919 --> 00:05:37.587
It looked like I was,
like, trying...

00:05:37.587 --> 00:05:39.506
like I was about to do
a prank on a plane.

00:05:39.506 --> 00:05:41.591
(laughter)
Like, that was how much
broccoli I was eating.

00:05:41.591 --> 00:05:43.468
It's like bioterrorism.

00:05:43.468 --> 00:05:44.761
It really was.

00:05:44.761 --> 00:05:46.304
It was so...
it was so much, yeah.

00:05:46.304 --> 00:05:48.265
Now we're gonna have to
arrest your ass.

00:05:48.265 --> 00:05:49.808
Yeah, I did
a "Hiking with Kevin."

00:05:49.808 --> 00:05:51.184
Um, you can go check that out.

00:05:51.184 --> 00:05:53.645
It's on Kevin Nealon's
YouTube channel.

00:05:53.645 --> 00:05:56.690
But at one point he was like,
"Have you farted on this hike?"

00:05:56.690 --> 00:05:58.400
And I'm like... "No."

00:05:58.400 --> 00:05:59.734
And he's like,
"Do you want...?"

00:05:59.734 --> 00:06:01.361
And I'm like,
"I don't even think...

00:06:01.361 --> 00:06:03.655
"I'm sure I could, but I think
my body shuts down,

00:06:03.655 --> 00:06:05.782
and it's like, well, no farts
are coming out right now."

00:06:05.782 --> 00:06:08.368
Mm-hmm.
When it's...
When you know the com...

00:06:08.368 --> 00:06:09.953
Like, right now
I couldn't fart,

00:06:09.953 --> 00:06:11.621
even though I probably have
so many farts in me.

00:06:11.621 --> 00:06:13.873
I've had coffee,
I ate a lot last night.
(laughs)

00:06:13.873 --> 00:06:15.625
Got a couple
in the chamber.
I chewed a lot of gum this morning too.

00:06:15.625 --> 00:06:17.252
Like, every...
Gum?

00:06:17.252 --> 00:06:19.337
Oh, gum makes me
fart like crazy.

00:06:19.337 --> 00:06:21.214
It makes everyone fart, 'cause
you, like, breathe in air.

00:06:21.214 --> 00:06:22.382
Oh, wow.
And it's that

00:06:22.382 --> 00:06:23.592
fake sugar.
Otherwise,

00:06:23.592 --> 00:06:25.218
she's not breathing --.
Yeah.

00:06:25.218 --> 00:06:26.720
(laughter)

00:06:26.720 --> 00:06:29.264
It makes you swallow air
is what I meant to say.

00:06:29.264 --> 00:06:31.975
What have I taught...
thank you for catching that.

00:06:31.975 --> 00:06:35.103
No, it makes you swallow air
and it has the aspartame in it,

00:06:35.103 --> 00:06:37.689
which makes me...
like, the sugar-free stuff?

00:06:37.689 --> 00:06:40.317
Mm-hmm.
Oh, yeah.
That gives you disgusting farts.

00:06:40.317 --> 00:06:43.153
Like... farts made in a lab.

00:06:43.153 --> 00:06:45.864
They're bad.
Those farts kill rats
in a lab.

00:06:45.864 --> 00:06:47.449
Yeah, do you ever eat
sugar-free stuff, Myka?

00:06:47.449 --> 00:06:49.242
I, I used to, I, you know,
I grew up in the '80s,

00:06:49.242 --> 00:06:50.619
so that's all we ate.

00:06:50.619 --> 00:06:52.412
Yeah, I mean,
the... it's disgusting.

00:06:52.412 --> 00:06:54.289
Yeah.
Those farts are really
disgusting.

00:06:54.289 --> 00:06:56.374
We gotta move on
from fart talk, it's
kinda grossing me out...

00:06:56.374 --> 00:06:59.377
(laughs)
...and it takes a lot
to gross me out.

00:06:59.377 --> 00:07:01.796
Hey. Hi.
Kerryn Feehan
just walked in the door.

00:07:01.796 --> 00:07:03.048
Sorry I'm late.

00:07:03.048 --> 00:07:04.883
Um, we are not sorry
that you're late...

00:07:04.883 --> 00:07:06.384
(laughs)
...because you sent us
a picture of your ass

00:07:06.384 --> 00:07:08.136
in consolation.
Yeah, thank you.

00:07:08.136 --> 00:07:10.472
So, Kerryn was running late
today and she, um, texted Myka.

00:07:10.472 --> 00:07:12.432
She was like, "I'm running late,
the train, whatever."

00:07:12.432 --> 00:07:15.977
(Ian)
And me.
And Ian, and, um, and said, "Show this to everyone."

00:07:15.977 --> 00:07:18.521
Like, as a consolation prize,
and it was a picture of her,

00:07:18.521 --> 00:07:21.941
um, taking a selfie in
the mirror with her fine ass.

00:07:21.941 --> 00:07:23.526
Thank you so much.
Your fine, naked ass.

00:07:23.526 --> 00:07:24.861
Is this the hot girl
side of the table?

00:07:24.861 --> 00:07:27.238
Oh, yeah.
(laughing)

00:07:27.238 --> 00:07:28.531
We'll get Myka over here.

00:07:28.531 --> 00:07:29.574
Hey, what?
I'm a hot girl.

00:07:29.574 --> 00:07:30.617
Okay, you are.

00:07:30.617 --> 00:07:32.410
Some days you are.
(Ian laughs)

00:07:32.410 --> 00:07:33.662
I'm a hot bitch.

00:07:33.662 --> 00:07:35.580
Yup.
Uh...

00:07:35.580 --> 00:07:38.124
How was, uh, everyone's
weekend, guys? Good?

00:07:38.124 --> 00:07:40.126
Great.
Yes.
Did we have good times?

00:07:40.126 --> 00:07:41.878
Any good stories come out of it?
Anything of note?

00:07:41.878 --> 00:07:44.339
I was in Phoenix, had a lot
of Squirt Nation come out,

00:07:44.339 --> 00:07:47.759
shout out to Anushka...
Nanushka.

00:07:47.759 --> 00:07:49.260
You said I wouldn't remember
your name, and I didn't.

00:07:49.260 --> 00:07:51.596
Yes, I did. Anushka and Ali.
Yeah.

00:07:51.596 --> 00:07:53.515
and then that tall black man
who was super nice

00:07:53.515 --> 00:07:55.100
but I forget your name.

00:07:55.100 --> 00:07:57.268
Uh, he was a listener
to the show, really nice guy,

00:07:57.268 --> 00:07:58.812
forgot your name,
but I did ask for it,

00:07:58.812 --> 00:08:00.480
'cause I was like,
I was gonna give you a shout-out

00:08:00.480 --> 00:08:01.940
but I didn't remember it.

00:08:01.940 --> 00:08:03.566
After Anushka... I had to
commit that to memory...

00:08:03.566 --> 00:08:05.902
Yeah.
...and then I lost yours,
and then another guy

00:08:05.902 --> 00:08:08.363
that I only remember your name
because you messaged me later,

00:08:08.363 --> 00:08:09.406
Peter is also a listener.

00:08:09.406 --> 00:08:10.448
Thank you for coming out.

00:08:10.448 --> 00:08:11.783
If you come to the show

00:08:11.783 --> 00:08:13.451
and you listen
and you tell me your name,

00:08:13.451 --> 00:08:15.161
I will give you
a shout-out on Monday's show,

00:08:15.161 --> 00:08:16.413
uh, generally, if I remember.

00:08:16.413 --> 00:08:17.789
But thank you for listening

00:08:17.789 --> 00:08:20.625
and thank you for coming
to those shows. Um...

00:08:20.625 --> 00:08:22.502
Yeah, I'm...
If it was a tall black guy
in Arizona,

00:08:22.502 --> 00:08:24.295
it had to be a Phoenix Sun.

00:08:24.295 --> 00:08:25.839
(laughing)
Yeah. Yeah.

00:08:25.839 --> 00:08:27.132
'Cause there are...
those are

00:08:27.132 --> 00:08:28.258
the only black people
in the entire state.

00:08:28.258 --> 00:08:29.384
It was a weird...

00:08:29.384 --> 00:08:31.302
Phoenix is hot...
Yeah.

00:08:31.302 --> 00:08:34.305
...and weird, but it's... it was
good, it was a fun time. Yeah.

00:08:34.305 --> 00:08:35.849
Nice.
Andrew and I
had a good weekend.

00:08:35.849 --> 00:08:39.728
He... I... oh, man,
he is on a plane right now.

00:08:39.728 --> 00:08:41.604
He got stuck on a...
(laughing)

00:08:41.604 --> 00:08:44.023
We got the wrong...
we booked the wrong ticket home.

00:08:44.023 --> 00:08:45.859
I booked the wrong ticket home.

00:08:45.859 --> 00:08:47.986
So, I was supposed to leave
at 1:20 in the morning

00:08:47.986 --> 00:08:49.362
after our shows...
like, we were supposed to go

00:08:49.362 --> 00:08:50.530
right from the shows
to the airport.

00:08:50.530 --> 00:08:51.948
(Ian)
Uh-huh.

00:08:51.948 --> 00:08:53.616
I was like, "Oh, my God."
I, I loved it.

00:08:53.616 --> 00:08:55.577
I was like, "I don't have to
go back to my hotel room."

00:08:55.577 --> 00:08:57.704
It's perfect.
And then wake up at 7:00.

00:08:57.704 --> 00:08:59.205
Yup.
It's just, like, on.

00:08:59.205 --> 00:09:00.874
I was so excited,
and then I looked at my ticket

00:09:00.874 --> 00:09:02.584
just to be like,
"Wait, where are we sitting?"

00:09:02.584 --> 00:09:04.252
In between the shows.

00:09:04.252 --> 00:09:05.920
And I realized
it was for Monday morning.

00:09:05.920 --> 00:09:07.464
Oh...
Oh...

00:09:07.464 --> 00:09:09.132
And I was like, "Oh, no,"
and I, I called Jenn,

00:09:09.132 --> 00:09:12.177
'cause Jenn helps me with
this kinda stuff on the weekends

00:09:12.177 --> 00:09:14.804
when she can, and I called
Jenn, our producer,

00:09:14.804 --> 00:09:16.806
and she fixed it,
but, um, it... but An...

00:09:16.806 --> 00:09:18.224
Jenn...
But got Andrew stuck.

00:09:18.224 --> 00:09:19.476
...we couldn't get Andrew
on a different flight,

00:09:19.476 --> 00:09:21.144
so Andrew kept that flight.

00:09:21.144 --> 00:09:23.688
He had to stay in Phoenix
yesterday all day.
Oh, no.

00:09:23.688 --> 00:09:24.689
(imitates, nasally)
"The snake on a plane."

00:09:24.689 --> 00:09:25.899
Oh, my God, and I was, like,

00:09:25.899 --> 00:09:26.983
"You should do something
with your day.

00:09:26.983 --> 00:09:28.443
"Go out and go to a...

00:09:28.443 --> 00:09:30.779
"Uh, there's spring training
happening there, like,

00:09:30.779 --> 00:09:32.822
at the stadium right across
the street, like, there's..."
Oh, that's so fun.

00:09:32.822 --> 00:09:34.616
...and we made friends
with local comics.

00:09:34.616 --> 00:09:36.493
Right.
Like, there were people that
wanted to hang out with him,

00:09:36.493 --> 00:09:37.619
and he just...
yesterday, all he did

00:09:37.619 --> 00:09:38.828
was sit in the hotel room
all day.

00:09:38.828 --> 00:09:40.163
He's like, "I went to the...

00:09:40.163 --> 00:09:42.749
I went to the pool
for 15 minutes and..."

00:09:42.749 --> 00:09:44.042
(laughter)
That was it.
Like...

00:09:44.042 --> 00:09:47.003
I, I just...
I worried about him.

00:09:47.003 --> 00:09:48.630
"I dunked my sandwich
in the pool

00:09:48.630 --> 00:09:50.256
to get it wet
so I could eat it."

00:09:50.256 --> 00:09:52.550
(laughter)
"So it was mushy
so I could chews it."

00:09:52.550 --> 00:09:55.094
Chew, chew... I said chews it.
Chews it?

00:09:55.094 --> 00:09:58.097
Oh, my God, he is saying,
"Huh?" so much,

00:09:58.097 --> 00:09:59.516
and he's got me saying "Huh?"

00:09:59.516 --> 00:10:01.518
instead of "What?"
or "Could you say that again?"

00:10:01.518 --> 00:10:02.560
or "Pardon?"
Oh, no.

00:10:02.560 --> 00:10:04.312
"Huh?"
We were doing...
Ugh.

00:10:04.312 --> 00:10:06.773
That is not the direction
that the influence should go.

00:10:06.773 --> 00:10:08.024
(laughing)
I know.

00:10:08.024 --> 00:10:09.192
He should be
getting funnier

00:10:09.192 --> 00:10:11.069
and more erudite.
Not cool.

00:10:11.069 --> 00:10:13.029
I am saying, "Huh?", he...

00:10:13.029 --> 00:10:14.864
'cause I call him out
every time he says it,

00:10:14.864 --> 00:10:16.491
and then I started saying it...
Oh...

00:10:16.491 --> 00:10:18.576
...and it is, it is an epidemic.
Yeah.

00:10:18.576 --> 00:10:20.119
"Huh?"

00:10:20.119 --> 00:10:21.955
"Huh?"
Oh...

00:10:21.955 --> 00:10:23.957
Oh...
Like a donkey.

00:10:23.957 --> 00:10:26.417
It is so bad.
Uh...

00:10:26.417 --> 00:10:29.379
I used to, I used to get...
made fun of by my family

00:10:29.379 --> 00:10:32.632
for saying, "Wool..."
instead of, like, "Well..."

00:10:32.632 --> 00:10:34.050
I go, "Wool..."

00:10:34.050 --> 00:10:35.260
Oh, that's a good one.

00:10:35.260 --> 00:10:36.845
"Wool..."
Yeah, yeah, you do say that.

00:10:36.845 --> 00:10:38.471
"Wool, you don't know."

00:10:38.471 --> 00:10:40.390
My dad used to make...
get mad at me

00:10:40.390 --> 00:10:43.184
'cause he used to...
'cause I'd go, "No... ah."
Oh, yeah.

00:10:43.184 --> 00:10:44.435
And he'd go, "Noah's Ark?"

00:10:44.435 --> 00:10:46.104
(laughter)
So I always say your name.

00:10:46.104 --> 00:10:47.856
He goes, "Why you
bringing Noah into this?"

00:10:47.856 --> 00:10:51.484
I'd be like,
"I hate you, Dad! No... ah!"

00:10:51.484 --> 00:10:53.778
Um...
(Kerryn)
Dad burn.

00:10:53.778 --> 00:10:55.405
(Ian)
That's great.
So I was saying your name all...

00:10:55.405 --> 00:10:58.074
Noah, I was saying your name
my whole childhood.
Hmm.

00:10:58.074 --> 00:11:01.661
Um, yeah, it was, uh,
it was a good weekend of shows.

00:11:01.661 --> 00:11:02.620
Yeah, someone, um...

00:11:02.620 --> 00:11:04.706
Apparently, someone's
pretending to be me on Facebook

00:11:04.706 --> 00:11:06.499
and has started an account
that looks exactly like mine...

00:11:06.499 --> 00:11:07.876
- Oh, Myka... 
- ...and is messaging

00:11:07.876 --> 00:11:08.626
a lot of my friends. 
-You caught me.

00:11:08.626 --> 00:11:09.544
Good for you.

00:11:09.544 --> 00:11:12.130
-Myka... 
-I'm getting so many followers.

00:11:12.130 --> 00:11:13.172
(laughing) 
She's caught.

00:11:13.172 --> 00:11:15.800
And someone wrote my dad,
and then my dad wrote me.

00:11:15.800 --> 00:11:16.885
-Nuh-uh.
-He'd be like, "Is this you?"

00:11:16.885 --> 00:11:18.720
And I go, "Dad, why would I
talk like that?"

00:11:18.720 --> 00:11:20.430
It sounds like someone
who's learning...

00:11:20.430 --> 00:11:22.140
It sounds like a bot, you know?
-Yeah.

00:11:22.140 --> 00:11:23.266
Like, and there's... like,

00:11:23.266 --> 00:11:25.602
"I sincerely appreciate
you writing me, good sir."

00:11:25.602 --> 00:11:26.811
Like, it's, like, that.

00:11:26.811 --> 00:11:27.937
-No...
-Wow.

00:11:27.937 --> 00:11:28.605
And my dad was like,
"Is this you?"

00:11:28.605 --> 00:11:30.231
Have you seen the movie "Us"?

00:11:30.231 --> 00:11:30.982
-Not yet.
-No, not yet.

00:11:30.982 --> 00:11:32.066
Oh, boy, that sounds like

00:11:32.066 --> 00:11:34.777
it's from "Us."
-Doppelgangers, right?

00:11:34.777 --> 00:11:36.821
Oh, like someone kinda being you
but not you.

00:11:36.821 --> 00:11:37.655
Uh-huh, yeah.

00:11:37.655 --> 00:11:38.907
Cool reference, though,
nobody can get.

00:11:38.907 --> 00:11:39.991
-Yeah. 
-You know what, Kerryn?

00:11:39.991 --> 00:11:40.950
-- off, all right?
(laughter)

00:11:40.950 --> 00:11:42.285
It's the new Jordan Peele...

00:11:42.285 --> 00:11:43.786
- Yeah.
-...movie that everyone saw

00:11:43.786 --> 00:11:45.330
-I saw it Thursday
-This weekend.

00:11:45.330 --> 00:11:45.914
and it was really good.

00:11:45.914 --> 00:11:47.373
Yeah, everyone saw it.
Everyone...

00:11:47.373 --> 00:11:49.083
Keep bragging about having $13.

00:11:49.083 --> 00:11:50.209
(laughter)

00:11:50.209 --> 00:11:51.878
I get the senior tickets.

00:11:51.878 --> 00:11:53.087
(laughter)
You -- would.

00:11:53.087 --> 00:11:54.505
-Yeah, yeah. Yeah.
-You Dreyfus.

00:11:54.505 --> 00:11:56.966
-Ian does get...
-First seating in airlines.

00:11:56.966 --> 00:11:58.551
-Yeah.
-Dreyfus.

00:11:58.551 --> 00:12:00.803
One time I was on a date
and, uh, they caught me...

00:12:00.803 --> 00:12:02.972
-With a what?
-And it, it was... yes.

00:12:02.972 --> 00:12:04.015
Look at him
bragging and bragging.

00:12:04.015 --> 00:12:05.350
-Yeah.
-I know.

00:12:05.350 --> 00:12:07.602
And, uh, and she lost 
her --... on them.

00:12:07.602 --> 00:12:08.311
She was like--
'cause I was like,

00:12:08.311 --> 00:12:09.979
"My grandmother
bought me these tickets."

00:12:09.979 --> 00:12:11.731
-Oh, my God.
-So you bought the senior

00:12:11.731 --> 00:12:14.192
tickets online and then when you
met them in person 

00:12:14.192 --> 00:12:14.984
and the ticket tearer was
like...

00:12:14.984 --> 00:12:16.194
They were, like,
"Hey, it's a senior."

00:12:16.194 --> 00:12:17.320
And I was like, "Well,
you know, my grandmother."

00:12:17.320 --> 00:12:18.905
You took a date
on a senior discount?

00:12:18.905 --> 00:12:20.114
I know, isn't that insane?

00:12:20.114 --> 00:12:21.240
Why didn't you just bring out

00:12:21.240 --> 00:12:22.492
the Entertainment Book
of Coupons?

00:12:22.492 --> 00:12:24.035
-Right.
-I know, it's really...

00:12:24.035 --> 00:12:26.120
-You -- cheapskate.
-What do you want from me?

00:12:26.120 --> 00:12:27.455
But then, Myka,
his date defended him.

00:12:27.455 --> 00:12:28.039
Yeah.

00:12:28.039 --> 00:12:30.041
...and was like,"His
grandma bought these!

00:12:30.041 --> 00:12:31.042
-Yeah
-"His grandma bought these!

00:12:31.042 --> 00:12:33.044
-Oh, my God. 
-Yeah, it was, it was a...

00:12:33.044 --> 00:12:35.463
Which is an insane thing, that
your grandma would go online

00:12:35.463 --> 00:12:36.547
and buy you tickets...
-Well, my  grandmom's dead,

00:12:36.547 --> 00:12:37.090
...for your date. 

00:12:37.090 --> 00:12:39.801
so... all my family's dead, so
it was a lie to begin with.

00:12:39.801 --> 00:12:41.010
That was a really good
impersonation

00:12:41.010 --> 00:12:43.221
of your tranny date. 
(laughter)

00:12:43.221 --> 00:12:45.181
What was...
it was one of my girls,

00:12:45.181 --> 00:12:47.308
and the, the fella
really came out.

00:12:47.308 --> 00:12:50.186
Yeah.
(laughter)

00:12:50.186 --> 00:12:53.439
I mean,
it was a real 'tude, dude.

00:12:53.439 --> 00:12:56.359
(laughter)

00:12:56.359 --> 00:12:58.611
I was like, "I've never seen
this side of you before."

00:12:58.611 --> 00:13:00.196
What would it be like?
Yeah.

00:13:00.196 --> 00:13:01.406
"I hope to later tonight,
but, uh..."

00:13:01.406 --> 00:13:03.366
Yeah, yeah, yeah,
yeah, yeah. Please.

00:13:03.366 --> 00:13:05.702
He's got
his mustache ready.

00:13:05.702 --> 00:13:07.078
Ian Fidance is here.

00:13:07.078 --> 00:13:08.204
-Yeah. 
-Myka Fox is here.

00:13:08.204 --> 00:13:08.871
Woot-woot!

00:13:08.871 --> 00:13:10.540
-Kerryn Feehan is here.
-Woot-woot.

00:13:10.540 --> 00:13:11.958
Uh, you can hear
their podcasts...

00:13:11.958 --> 00:13:13.668
What is your podcast,
you guys?

00:13:13.668 --> 00:13:15.753
-Oh, it's defunct.
-Oh, never mind.

00:13:15.753 --> 00:13:17.005
But you should still...

00:13:17.005 --> 00:13:19.298
Well, you can listen
to Ian's podcast,

00:13:19.298 --> 00:13:21.175
"Ian Fidance's Wild World."

00:13:21.175 --> 00:13:24.220
Yeah, well, I got a new one:
"Sex Ian the City."

00:13:24.220 --> 00:13:25.430
Yes, "Sex Ian the City,"

00:13:25.430 --> 00:13:26.431
in which you lit...
-Yes.

00:13:26.431 --> 00:13:28.057
-Oh, shut up, Ian.
...watch "Sex and the City."

00:13:28.057 --> 00:13:29.392
-Yeah.
-You, you made a podcast

00:13:29.392 --> 00:13:30.601
just for a title?

00:13:30.601 --> 00:13:32.812
I... no.
I've never seen

00:13:32.812 --> 00:13:34.147
"Sex and the City..."
-Yeah, which came first?

00:13:34.147 --> 00:13:35.982
My buddy's seen every episode,

00:13:35.982 --> 00:13:37.734
and I've always kinda hated it,
We're rewatching it, and I...

00:13:37.734 --> 00:13:38.818
And what are you on right
now?

00:13:38.818 --> 00:13:39.777
...loves it, uh...

00:13:39.777 --> 00:13:41.154
-Yeah, isn't it great? 
-Uh...

00:13:41.154 --> 00:13:42.280
Are you Aidan or Big?

00:13:42.280 --> 00:13:43.531
I haven't gotten
to Aidan yet.

00:13:43.531 --> 00:13:45.283
-Oh, --.
-We're just on episode 106.

00:13:45.283 --> 00:13:46.784
-Oh, wow.
-But we have

00:13:46.784 --> 00:13:49.203
real bad ADD,
so we have a hard time

00:13:49.203 --> 00:13:49.871
sticking to the episode.
-I, I was reading

00:13:49.871 --> 00:13:51.080
the reviews of your ep...

00:13:51.080 --> 00:13:52.331
of your podcast,
'cause you had posted some.

00:13:52.331 --> 00:13:54.292
-Uh-huh.
-People really seem to like it.

00:13:54.292 --> 00:13:56.252
But people are like, "Uh, you
don't even talk about the show."

00:13:56.252 --> 00:13:57.754
-Yeah, yeah, yeah.
-I could tell.

00:13:57.754 --> 00:14:00.006
-Yeah, it's very fun.
-Yeah, yeah, yeah. Um...

00:14:00.006 --> 00:14:01.841
What are... do you...
what, what are your...

00:14:01.841 --> 00:14:03.718
what's your takeaways
from watching six episodes?

00:14:03.718 --> 00:14:05.636
Uh, I -- love Carrie.

00:14:05.636 --> 00:14:07.430
She smokes indoors...
-Yeah.

00:14:07.430 --> 00:14:11.184
...um, and I wanna be
as cool as Big, and, uh...

00:14:11.184 --> 00:14:13.561
I want that for you too.
-Yeah? Thank you.

00:14:13.561 --> 00:14:15.188
I don't see it
coming even close.

00:14:15.188 --> 00:14:16.189
- Who were you guys into?
- No?

00:14:16.189 --> 00:14:17.065
-Oh, on the show?
-Mm-hmm.

00:14:17.065 --> 00:14:18.191
-Big, a thousand percent.
-Really?

00:14:18.191 --> 00:14:19.025
I hate Miranda.

00:14:19.025 --> 00:14:20.151
-Oh, yeah.
-I like Big. Why?

00:14:20.151 --> 00:14:21.319
I can't stand Miranda.

00:14:21.319 --> 00:14:23.237
Most people are not,
like, into her.

00:14:23.237 --> 00:14:23.738
Yeah.

00:14:23.738 --> 00:14:25.323
Because she's the only
believable character 

00:14:25.323 --> 00:14:26.199
on that show.

00:14:26.199 --> 00:14:27.784
Why, 'cause she wears 
-- collared suits?

00:14:27.784 --> 00:14:29.118
No, 'cause she makes sense.

00:14:29.118 --> 00:14:30.578
Everyone else is acting
like an idiot all day.

00:14:30.578 --> 00:14:32.163
Yeah, that's a good point.

00:14:32.163 --> 00:14:33.331
-She's not as interesting. 
- Like, Samantha's over here

00:14:33.331 --> 00:14:34.749
putting, like,
pineapple on her --

00:14:34.749 --> 00:14:36.000
and making people, like,
turn it into a soufflé.

00:14:36.000 --> 00:14:37.502
I'm like,
"I don't know what happening."

00:14:37.502 --> 00:14:38.586
Yeah, yeah, she's...

00:14:38.586 --> 00:14:40.254
Actually, no, no, no.
I don't like Charlotte,

00:14:40.254 --> 00:14:41.297
that's who I don't like.
-Well, yeah.

00:14:41.297 --> 00:14:43.216
You know what I don't like
is that they're selling us

00:14:43.216 --> 00:14:44.926
that any of these women
are friends...

00:14:44.926 --> 00:14:46.094
...outside of their connection
with Carrie.

00:14:46.094 --> 00:14:46.928
-Yes!
-Right.

00:14:46.928 --> 00:14:49.555
Like, when they do a 
Charlotte/Samantha storyline...

00:14:49.555 --> 00:14:50.098
No way.

00:14:50.098 --> 00:14:51.557
...where, like, they care
about each other, I'm like...

00:14:51.557 --> 00:14:52.517
-No. 
-"...Yeah, right."

00:14:52.517 --> 00:14:53.309
Oh, I haven't gotten 
there yet.

00:14:53.309 --> 00:14:55.353
If Carrie's going, like,
"Hey, Samantha,

00:14:55.353 --> 00:14:57.313
let's go to brunch,
Charlotte's coming,"

00:14:57.313 --> 00:14:58.773
Samantha would go,
"I'm gonna...

00:14:58.773 --> 00:14:59.732
-Yes!
-...bail out, honey."

00:14:59.732 --> 00:15:00.733
(laughter)
Yeah. Yeah.

00:15:00.733 --> 00:15:02.110
-In a heartbeat.
-Right.

00:15:02.110 --> 00:15:04.695
She would never hang out
with Charlotte, ever.

00:15:04.695 --> 00:15:05.613
-No. No.
-Miranda and Samantha

00:15:05.613 --> 00:15:06.614
might get along.

00:15:06.614 --> 00:15:07.615
Like, I could see those two.

00:15:07.615 --> 00:15:08.908
Charlotte is a bummer.
Yeah.

00:15:08.908 --> 00:15:10.493
No one would ever be
friends with her.

00:15:10.493 --> 00:15:11.828
She sucks,
she would only be friends

00:15:11.828 --> 00:15:13.955
with people exactly like her.

00:15:13.955 --> 00:15:16.249
She would never be friends with
someone as cool as, uh, Carrie.

00:15:16.249 --> 00:15:18.251
-Right.
-She's a, she's a bummer.

00:15:18.251 --> 00:15:21.629
She thinks everything... she's,
uh, uptight about everything.

00:15:21.629 --> 00:15:22.130
Yeah.

00:15:22.130 --> 00:15:24.590
And she doesn't like to, like,
really share much about herself,

00:15:24.590 --> 00:15:25.967
which is what you look for
in a friend,

00:15:25.967 --> 00:15:27.260
is someone who's, like...
lets you share

00:15:27.260 --> 00:15:29.554
a lot of weird stuff
and doesn't judge you,

00:15:29.554 --> 00:15:30.763
and also shares weird stuff
about herself.

00:15:30.763 --> 00:15:32.390
She's a, she's a... 
the worst.

00:15:32.390 --> 00:15:33.975
She's that
New York archetype, though,

00:15:33.975 --> 00:15:35.351
that had to be
in the script, though.

00:15:35.351 --> 00:15:36.769
Yeah, it makes sense 
why she's in it.

00:15:36.769 --> 00:15:38.062
She was that, like...
little princess.

00:15:38.062 --> 00:15:39.856
But she would never be
friends with any of them.

00:15:39.856 --> 00:15:41.482
I dug, in, like,
one of the first episodes,

00:15:41.482 --> 00:15:44.735
how, uh, Samantha was like,
"Have sex like a man."

00:15:44.735 --> 00:15:46.571
And then Carrie has
some guy go down on her

00:15:46.571 --> 00:15:47.738
and then she was like,
"Okay, go."

00:15:47.738 --> 00:15:48.948
(Kerryn, laughing)
Right.

00:15:48.948 --> 00:15:50.449
"I'm gonna smoke
a cigarette."

00:15:50.449 --> 00:15:51.951
And I was like,
"Yeah! That's my ideal day."

00:15:51.951 --> 00:15:53.995
-Yeah...
-I relate to Samantha

00:15:53.995 --> 00:15:56.038
'cause she refuses
to get an AIDS test.

00:15:56.038 --> 00:15:58.207
(laughter)

00:15:58.207 --> 00:16:00.126
Oh, you pulled a Samantha?

00:16:00.126 --> 00:16:03.421
That's... yeah...
the, um, "Act like a dude."

00:16:03.421 --> 00:16:04.839
Just, like, have a guy...

00:16:04.839 --> 00:16:07.008
That's what the...
there used to be, like, um...

00:16:07.008 --> 00:16:08.885
I heard a story
about Britney Spears,

00:16:08.885 --> 00:16:10.887
that she would just, like,
have guys.

00:16:10.887 --> 00:16:12.638
Like, she would pick out
a guy at a dance club

00:16:12.638 --> 00:16:14.223
and they'd be like, "Miss Spears
is waiting for you."

00:16:14.223 --> 00:16:15.433
Oh, no, this is...

00:16:15.433 --> 00:16:17.476
-Oh, I love her so much.
-What?

00:16:17.476 --> 00:16:19.604
-That is so hot.
-I heard a story about a, um...

00:16:19.604 --> 00:16:20.813
This is what I was ins...

00:16:20.813 --> 00:16:22.398
I was talking
about the Britney thing

00:16:22.398 --> 00:16:25.359
because I heard, um, s...
I forget who told the story,

00:16:25.359 --> 00:16:27.904
but it seemed
really trustworthy,

00:16:27.904 --> 00:16:30.615
that a certain
singer-songwriter-actress

00:16:30.615 --> 00:16:33.743
that we all know was...
had a party at her house,

00:16:33.743 --> 00:16:36.245
she had just broken up
with someone after a long time

00:16:36.245 --> 00:16:38.456
and had this, like, party of...
like, a coming-out party,

00:16:38.456 --> 00:16:40.499
like, "I'm out of this
relationship," and, uh...

00:16:40.499 --> 00:16:42.168
Oh, I remember who told me now.

00:16:42.168 --> 00:16:45.713
So then, she's, she meets this
guy, they have a good banter,

00:16:45.713 --> 00:16:47.673
he... all of a sudden
she's gone,

00:16:47.673 --> 00:16:50.968
and her assistant come up
to the guy and goes, "Um, she's,

00:16:50.968 --> 00:16:53.095
uh... Miss Blah-blah's
waiting for you upstairs."

00:16:53.095 --> 00:16:54.555
-And she's like...
-Ah...

00:16:54.555 --> 00:16:56.641
It's, like, at her house
that the party's going on.

00:16:56.641 --> 00:16:58.643
He goes upstairs, they bang.

00:16:58.643 --> 00:16:59.894
(gasping)

00:16:59.894 --> 00:17:01.270
-And then...
-I love it.

00:17:01.270 --> 00:17:03.981
...he... and then, uh...
I, I think this...

00:17:03.981 --> 00:17:05.650
This is what happened
with Britney Spears.

00:17:05.650 --> 00:17:07.026
Britney Spears used to do this,

00:17:07.026 --> 00:17:08.611
and summon guys
upstairs or whatever.

00:17:08.611 --> 00:17:10.154
Like, her assistant
would just get them

00:17:10.154 --> 00:17:12.198
and tell them to arrive
at the house or whatever,

00:17:12.198 --> 00:17:14.533
then they'd be brought up,
and then they would bang.

00:17:14.533 --> 00:17:16.244
Britney would go to the
bathroom,

00:17:16.244 --> 00:17:18.079
you know, like, as you do after,
you go to the bathroom,

00:17:18.079 --> 00:17:19.789
and then the assistant would...

00:17:19.789 --> 00:17:21.290
she would text her assistant
from the bathroom,

00:17:21.290 --> 00:17:22.792
like, "Get him out..."

00:17:22.792 --> 00:17:23.542
(gasping)
...and the assistant would come

00:17:23.542 --> 00:17:26.170
and go, "Miss Spears, um...
your car is ready, sir."

00:17:26.170 --> 00:17:26.796
Oh, my God, I love it.

00:17:26.796 --> 00:17:29.757
-"Your car's ready."
-And she would never even...

00:17:29.757 --> 00:17:32.385
She would never... this would
just be during the day.

00:17:32.385 --> 00:17:33.803
She would... he would be
brought to her house,

00:17:33.803 --> 00:17:34.845
like, she would, like...
- Oh...

00:17:34.845 --> 00:17:36.138
- During the day.
- ...ask...

00:17:36.138 --> 00:17:36.681
Or whatever.
-I love it.

00:17:36.681 --> 00:17:40.559
Like, she wanted to have sex,
she would ride a guy, come,

00:17:40.559 --> 00:17:42.353
go to the bathroom,
then text her assistant,

00:17:42.353 --> 00:17:43.938
"Get this guy outta there."

00:17:43.938 --> 00:17:45.898
The guy would be gone by
the time she went back to bed,

00:17:45.898 --> 00:17:47.233
so she would never
have to say goodbye...

00:17:47.233 --> 00:17:48.484
she would never have to
do any of like, the...

00:17:48.484 --> 00:17:50.027
-Oh... 
-That sounds awful, actually.

00:17:50.027 --> 00:17:51.320
-I love it!
-I kinda love it.

00:17:51.320 --> 00:17:52.113
If it was me, though,
I'd be like,

00:17:52.113 --> 00:17:54.407
"Miss Feenan is waiting
for you at a bus stop."

00:17:54.407 --> 00:17:55.700
Yeah.
(laughter)

00:17:55.700 --> 00:17:57.326
I, like, wouldn't be,
like glamorous-- I love it!

00:17:57.326 --> 00:17:58.869
"Your Uber pool is here."

00:17:58.869 --> 00:18:00.204
-Right, I love that power.
-I really...

00:18:00.204 --> 00:18:02.123
I think if I could do that,
I would do that.

00:18:02.123 --> 00:18:03.457
That... Motley Crue
used to do that.

00:18:03.457 --> 00:18:05.001
If I didn't have any of the...
'Cause sometimes..

00:18:05.001 --> 00:18:07.253
I just wanna... Sometimes 
I... you know.

00:18:07.253 --> 00:18:08.754
It's, like,
such a rock star move.

00:18:08.754 --> 00:18:10.339
To just, like...
I don't like the after stuff.

00:18:10.339 --> 00:18:13.384
I don't like...
sometimes even during sex,

00:18:13.384 --> 00:18:15.511
I would like to text
my assistant and be like...

00:18:15.511 --> 00:18:17.138
-"Can you get him out of here?"
-"Get him out."

00:18:17.138 --> 00:18:18.514
"Can you get him
out of my --?"

00:18:18.514 --> 00:18:19.849
"Yeah, can you ask him
to leave?"

00:18:19.849 --> 00:18:21.058
"Can you pull him out?"
(laughing)

00:18:21.058 --> 00:18:22.476
-I think it's just so brilliant.
-I love it.

00:18:22.476 --> 00:18:23.936
Then you don't have 
any of that awkward...

00:18:23.936 --> 00:18:26.272
I mean, I'm sure guys
do this all the time.

00:18:26.272 --> 00:18:28.566
Male celebrities are getting
their assistants...

00:18:28.566 --> 00:18:29.650
-Yeah. 
-...to get rid of bitches

00:18:29.650 --> 00:18:30.693
constantly.

00:18:30.693 --> 00:18:32.737
Derek Jeter used to give,
like, a gift bag.

00:18:32.737 --> 00:18:34.447
-Yeah.
-I've had guys, like,

00:18:34.447 --> 00:18:36.449
make me a cup of coffee
at 2:00 in the morning.

00:18:36.449 --> 00:18:38.451
I'm like, "Wait a minute."
(laughter)

00:18:38.451 --> 00:18:40.536
"Sorry, honey,
this ain't a sleepover."

00:18:40.536 --> 00:18:41.162
"I have to go now."

00:18:41.162 --> 00:18:42.538
Oh, my God.

00:18:42.538 --> 00:18:43.748
"You don't have to go home,

00:18:43.748 --> 00:18:45.750
but you can't stay here."
-Coffee.

00:18:45.750 --> 00:18:48.044
Guys get so weird after sex.

00:18:48.044 --> 00:18:49.128
-(Ian) Yeah.
-They really...

00:18:49.128 --> 00:18:50.338
- I, I really avoid it.
-Yeah.

00:18:50.338 --> 00:18:52.048
I avoid sex
'cause I don't wanna fart

00:18:52.048 --> 00:18:54.383
and I avoid it because I don't
wanna see them change afterward.

00:18:54.383 --> 00:18:57.386
Do you kiss on the mouth
after a hookup?

00:18:57.386 --> 00:18:58.596
Um, I, yeah, I would, yeah.

00:18:58.596 --> 00:19:00.556
-Yeah.
-Yeah, why?

00:19:00.556 --> 00:19:02.350
I always think that's
like a test, I don't know.

00:19:02.350 --> 00:19:04.018
-What?
-Like, I think, like,

00:19:04.018 --> 00:19:05.061
it wouldn't, like...
-Oh, like, kiss goodbye?

00:19:05.061 --> 00:19:05.978
Yeah, like a kiss goodbye.

00:19:05.978 --> 00:19:06.896
Sometimes guys
don't wanna... yeah.

00:19:06.896 --> 00:19:08.064
Like it's
too romantic now.

00:19:08.064 --> 00:19:09.398
Yes, it's too romantic.

00:19:09.398 --> 00:19:11.192
We just...
banged and it's over.

00:19:11.192 --> 00:19:12.193
Guys are always trying
to make out with me

00:19:12.193 --> 00:19:13.235
after they go down on me
and I'm like,

00:19:13.235 --> 00:19:15.029
"Ooh, I know what
that smells like. Get out."

00:19:15.029 --> 00:19:16.697
-You don't do it?
-Jesus, Kerryn.

00:19:16.697 --> 00:19:18.699
I mean, I will, reluctantly.
(laughs)

00:19:18.699 --> 00:19:20.368
-What? I freakin' love it.
-I mean, in fairness,

00:19:20.368 --> 00:19:22.370
I smelled Kerryn's chair,
so I don't blame her.

00:19:22.370 --> 00:19:23.329
Uh, no, I'm like, I'm like,

00:19:23.329 --> 00:19:25.664
you know, "This is like...
I just took a spin class, bro.

00:19:25.664 --> 00:19:27.625
I mean, it... maybe it's
good for you, but..."

00:19:27.625 --> 00:19:29.251
Even if I'm not, like...

00:19:29.251 --> 00:19:30.378
-Ugh...
-...as fresh as a daisy...

00:19:30.378 --> 00:19:31.629
(laughing)

00:19:31.629 --> 00:19:32.963
First of all,
no guy's going down on me

00:19:32.963 --> 00:19:34.340
if I'm not fresh as a daisy.
-Oh...

00:19:34.340 --> 00:19:35.716
Like, I would, I would just
be like,

00:19:35.716 --> 00:19:36.759
"No, you're not allowed
to do that."

00:19:36.759 --> 00:19:37.760
Are you kidding me?

00:19:37.760 --> 00:19:38.969
I'm like, "Clean it up.

00:19:38.969 --> 00:19:40.262
I mean,
it can't stay gross forever."

00:19:40.262 --> 00:19:41.972
Like,
"Can you get that lint?"

00:19:41.972 --> 00:19:45.351
(laughter)

00:19:45.351 --> 00:19:47.019
-I love...
-We're gross.

00:19:47.019 --> 00:19:48.938
...licking a guy's face
after he goes down on me.

00:19:48.938 --> 00:19:49.939
Me too.

00:19:49.939 --> 00:19:51.148
-Love... it.
-No.

00:19:51.148 --> 00:19:52.775
I am like a golden retriever

00:19:52.775 --> 00:19:55.319
who hasn't seen his owner
after he's been at war.

00:19:55.319 --> 00:19:56.445
(laughter)

00:19:56.445 --> 00:19:57.446
I'm like...

00:19:57.446 --> 00:20:00.032
(panting and yelping)

00:20:00.032 --> 00:20:01.200
Like, I pull them back up.

00:20:01.200 --> 00:20:02.410
I love it.

00:20:02.410 --> 00:20:04.370
I'm like,
"It's me, it's me."

00:20:04.370 --> 00:20:06.414
(laughter)
Oh, my God...

00:20:06.414 --> 00:20:08.499
That's, like,
the only way you could ever

00:20:08.499 --> 00:20:10.334
go down on yourself, kind of.
-Yeah.

00:20:10.334 --> 00:20:11.877
Yeah, I love it.

00:20:11.877 --> 00:20:13.671
I used to... I remember
the first time a guy did it,

00:20:13.671 --> 00:20:16.590
I was like, "Oh, God!
Good night, sir!"

00:20:16.590 --> 00:20:19.593
Like, I was disgusted
that he would even try,

00:20:19.593 --> 00:20:21.303
and then I...
now I've... I love it.

00:20:21.303 --> 00:20:23.180
I guess it also depends on,
like... it was like...

00:20:23.180 --> 00:20:24.932
if it's the first time,
I'm grossed out.

00:20:24.932 --> 00:20:26.142
Like, once I start
liking a guy,

00:20:26.142 --> 00:20:27.768
then I can, like,
get into it.

00:20:27.768 --> 00:20:30.271
-But it's your juice eitherway.
-Yeah. It's so good.

00:20:30.271 --> 00:20:31.480
I know, but, like, the
first time, I'm like,

00:20:31.480 --> 00:20:32.773
"We're really
that comfortable already?"

00:20:32.773 --> 00:20:34.066
I don't know.

00:20:34.066 --> 00:20:35.234
(Nikki)
Yeah, I guess it is...

00:20:35.234 --> 00:20:36.610
No, I...
what it is, it's like a p...

00:20:36.610 --> 00:20:38.362
what's good for the goose...

00:20:38.362 --> 00:20:40.990
It's like, that's how you know
whether or not your -- stank.

00:20:40.990 --> 00:20:42.783
And he's trying
to let you know.

00:20:42.783 --> 00:20:44.118
-I know. I'm like, "I get it."
-Yeah.

00:20:44.118 --> 00:20:45.786
I'm like, "You were
down there for a while."

00:20:45.786 --> 00:20:47.830
No, we figure it out
beforehand, though.

00:20:47.830 --> 00:20:49.373
I feel... do you really?

00:20:49.373 --> 00:20:50.541
And if it's bad,
we're not... yeah.

00:20:50.541 --> 00:20:52.001
Do you.. how do you,
how do you know?

00:20:52.001 --> 00:20:53.377
You do a little tip test.

00:20:53.377 --> 00:20:54.879
I don't know,
I've had guys pull off my pants

00:20:54.879 --> 00:20:56.714
and go right to it,

00:20:56.714 --> 00:20:59.300
and I'm like, "That...
you should have tested it."

00:20:59.300 --> 00:21:00.134
(laughing)
-Yeah.

00:21:00.134 --> 00:21:01.594
-Yeah, you test it.
-Yeah.

00:21:01.594 --> 00:21:03.804
You should have 'em pee
on the PrettyLitter first.

00:21:03.804 --> 00:21:04.805
-Yeah.
-Yeah.

00:21:04.805 --> 00:21:06.223
To check for...

00:21:06.223 --> 00:21:08.058
(laughter)

00:21:08.058 --> 00:21:11.020
I do feel like...
uh, yeah, I don't know.

00:21:11.020 --> 00:21:13.397
Once in a blue moon,
you'll just tear the panties off

00:21:13.397 --> 00:21:14.106
and go to town...

00:21:14.106 --> 00:21:15.483
-I feel bad when I...
-...but you gotta, you gotta 

00:21:15.483 --> 00:21:16.901
test it, it's just a...

00:21:16.901 --> 00:21:19.737
How will we know if they're,
like... if you're not into it?

00:21:19.737 --> 00:21:22.323
Like, how do we know if you're
like, "Uh-oh, this is a bad one.

00:21:22.323 --> 00:21:23.532
This one's not right.
Or it is."

00:21:23.532 --> 00:21:25.493
You make yourself a cup of
coffee...

00:21:25.493 --> 00:21:27.953
(laughter)
You just head out.

00:21:27.953 --> 00:21:29.163
Pour a coffee on it?

00:21:29.163 --> 00:21:30.789
Gotta go to work."
(Kerryn laughing)

00:21:30.789 --> 00:21:32.041
If they come back up for air

00:21:32.041 --> 00:21:34.627
within five seconds,
you know, right?

00:21:34.627 --> 00:21:36.378
-Yeah, that's a good point.
-That's what would happen.

00:21:36.378 --> 00:21:37.421
-Yeah, that's probably...
-But, like, haven't you...

00:21:37.421 --> 00:21:39.256
Or if they just, like,
go straight to sex.

00:21:39.256 --> 00:21:40.341
Haven't you gone down on a guy
with, like, musk?

00:21:40.341 --> 00:21:41.926
Yeah, if they just circle,
you're done.

00:21:41.926 --> 00:21:42.927
They start eating your ass.
They're like, 

00:21:42.927 --> 00:21:46.680
"This is probably better."
(laughter)

00:21:46.680 --> 00:21:48.724
"At least I understand
this smell."

00:21:48.724 --> 00:21:51.644
(laughter)

00:21:51.644 --> 00:21:53.562
"Oh, at least
I understand this."

00:21:53.562 --> 00:21:55.397
'Cause you...
I don't even understand

00:21:55.397 --> 00:21:56.815
vagina smell sometimes.
-No.

00:21:56.815 --> 00:21:58.359
I mean, it's just, like,
"What's going on?"

00:21:58.359 --> 00:22:00.402
-But week to week...
-If, if you...

00:22:00.402 --> 00:22:02.029
-It's all...
-If I really like the chick,

00:22:02.029 --> 00:22:03.989
I, I like her smell.

00:22:03.989 --> 00:22:05.157
-Yeah.
-Certain smells.

00:22:05.157 --> 00:22:06.534
But if it's just like
a whatever, it's like,

00:22:06.534 --> 00:22:07.535
"Uh, you're really..."

00:22:07.535 --> 00:22:10.371
That's the only way of knowing
that I, that I would...

00:22:10.371 --> 00:22:11.705
Like, 'cause sometimes
you're just like,

00:22:11.705 --> 00:22:13.123
"I don't know
what it's like down there,"

00:22:13.123 --> 00:22:15.084
and when you lick a guy's face,
you can be like,

00:22:15.084 --> 00:22:16.210
"Oh, okay, I could do that."

00:22:16.210 --> 00:22:17.545
-Mm-hmm.
-Yeah.

00:22:17.545 --> 00:22:18.963
Like, I feel like, "Okay,"
that I'm not...

00:22:18.963 --> 00:22:20.965
Or you could lick his fingers--
that's hot.

00:22:20.965 --> 00:22:21.966
Yeah, yeah, I've done that.

00:22:21.966 --> 00:22:23.092
-You know.
-Yeah.

00:22:23.092 --> 00:22:24.218
Or sometimes you'll,

00:22:24.218 --> 00:22:25.344
you'll peel
the panties off

00:22:25.344 --> 00:22:27.012
and you're like, "This is...

00:22:27.012 --> 00:22:29.473
Honey..."
-A penis.

00:22:29.473 --> 00:22:31.141
Really?
(laughing)

00:22:31.141 --> 00:22:33.561
If you're Ian.
(laughter)

00:22:33.561 --> 00:22:36.021
"Honey..."

00:22:36.021 --> 00:22:37.690
"Honey, yes..."

00:22:37.690 --> 00:22:39.900
Oh, man, she's got
some real big clit energy.

00:22:39.900 --> 00:22:41.569
Yeah.
(chuckles)

00:22:41.569 --> 00:22:44.780
I mean, I've, I've felt,
like, not so fresh sometimes

00:22:44.780 --> 00:22:46.699
when I've had sex before,
and been like,

00:22:46.699 --> 00:22:48.367
"Don't go down, it's not..."

00:22:48.367 --> 00:22:51.120
That's totally fine
to communicate it.
Yeah.

00:22:51.120 --> 00:22:52.371
You know?
I'm just... yeah.

00:22:52.371 --> 00:22:53.539
I mean, I really feel like,
though...

00:22:53.539 --> 00:22:54.999
Well, that's you, Ian.
You would...

00:22:54.999 --> 00:22:57.835
What would it take
for you to stop having sex...

00:22:57.835 --> 00:22:59.461
once you started?

00:22:59.461 --> 00:23:00.838
Fire alarm?
What do we,
what do we gotta do?

00:23:00.838 --> 00:23:01.922
Yeah.

00:23:01.922 --> 00:23:05.759
(laughter)

00:23:05.759 --> 00:23:07.177
At least stop talking
about it.

00:23:07.177 --> 00:23:09.513
Some... some sort of
state emergency.

00:23:09.513 --> 00:23:10.931
(Nikki, laughing)
Yeah...

00:23:10.931 --> 00:23:12.057
Tragedy.
Yeah.

00:23:12.057 --> 00:23:14.184
"This Amber Alert can wait."

00:23:14.184 --> 00:23:15.394
Yeah, it's like...

00:23:15.394 --> 00:23:17.896
I mean, when, when we, uh...

00:23:17.896 --> 00:23:20.274
if we blow you
after you've been inside us,

00:23:20.274 --> 00:23:21.900
then we're doing the same...

00:23:21.900 --> 00:23:23.694
Yeah.
We're licking ourselves
off of you.

00:23:23.694 --> 00:23:24.737
Yeah.
Essentially.

00:23:24.737 --> 00:23:26.322
Sometimes I...
yeah, I do that.

00:23:26.322 --> 00:23:27.865
I really surprise myself at
what I taste like sometimes.

00:23:27.865 --> 00:23:29.199
Like, "Oh, it's kinda
like pennies."

00:23:29.199 --> 00:23:30.451
Yes, pennies.

00:23:30.451 --> 00:23:32.161
Oh, they -- you
in the ass, Kerryn.

00:23:32.161 --> 00:23:35.205
Yeah, that's your butthole.
Damn it! Foiled again!

00:23:35.205 --> 00:23:37.916
That's what that...
it tastes like iron ore?
Okay.

00:23:37.916 --> 00:23:39.752
(laughing)

00:23:39.752 --> 00:23:42.838
I've been working on this
new bit about how, um...

00:23:42.838 --> 00:23:44.965
you know, I'm tired of guys
fingering us too soon,

00:23:44.965 --> 00:23:46.675
like, before we're wet.

00:23:46.675 --> 00:23:48.385
Like, it just really...
makes me insecure.
Oh, no.

00:23:48.385 --> 00:23:50.387
Well, wait a second...
but that's how you get wet.

00:23:50.387 --> 00:23:52.431
No... no...
No, rub my clit
to get me wet.

00:23:52.431 --> 00:23:54.391
Rub my...
like, outside my pants.
Yeah.

00:23:54.391 --> 00:23:56.226
Kiss me... --...
Oh, oh, okay, okay, okay,
yeah, yeah.

00:23:56.226 --> 00:23:58.604
Yeah.
Yeah. When they just go to
finger you, like, inside...

00:23:58.604 --> 00:24:00.105
Ooh.
...and you're totally, like,

00:24:00.105 --> 00:24:02.107
dry still...
Oh, like,
before anything... ooh!

00:24:02.107 --> 00:24:03.442
Not before anything,
but they make out with you

00:24:03.442 --> 00:24:04.693
for, like, two minutes.
Yeah.

00:24:04.693 --> 00:24:06.153
It's not enough to get...

00:24:06.153 --> 00:24:07.946
I, I need a little bit more
than that to get wet.

00:24:07.946 --> 00:24:09.156
Maybe I'm an old bitch,
but I...

00:24:09.156 --> 00:24:11.033
and I, and I don't drink
enough water,

00:24:11.033 --> 00:24:12.284
but I need more time.
These are the times
we're living in.

00:24:12.284 --> 00:24:13.577
What do you do?
Do you move the hand?

00:24:13.577 --> 00:24:14.870
Things are fast.
What, what's the move?

00:24:14.870 --> 00:24:16.622
If they go in too soon?
No, I just...

00:24:16.622 --> 00:24:18.582
I try to will it wet
while they're going down...
Right.

00:24:18.582 --> 00:24:20.209
...where, where...
if I feel their hand going down,

00:24:20.209 --> 00:24:23.212
I'm like, just like,
"Please get wet," and I don't.

00:24:23.212 --> 00:24:25.297
Oh, my move...
I'll just, like, blow them,

00:24:25.297 --> 00:24:27.007
and then I'm like,
"This'll give me enough time."

00:24:27.007 --> 00:24:28.801
Yup, yup.
(laughing)

00:24:28.801 --> 00:24:30.386
That's a good move.
That's a good move!

00:24:30.386 --> 00:24:32.012
I do that too,
I do that too.
Why has it gotta be them

00:24:32.012 --> 00:24:33.555
doing all the work?
Why can't you hop on top...

00:24:33.555 --> 00:24:34.848
Because you guys don't wait
for even me to blow you.

00:24:34.848 --> 00:24:35.933
...or -- dry hump
for a while?

00:24:35.933 --> 00:24:37.184
Right.
That's the thing, no.

00:24:37.184 --> 00:24:38.352
Yeah.
That's when you make the time.

00:24:38.352 --> 00:24:39.687
You're like,
"Oh, that sounds great,

00:24:39.687 --> 00:24:41.397
"but real fast,
let me blow you,

00:24:41.397 --> 00:24:43.107
get the juices going."
Yeah.
You know what?

00:24:43.107 --> 00:24:45.150
I don't wanna blow you because
you're not gonna go down on me,

00:24:45.150 --> 00:24:47.653
and you don't deserve to be
blown just because you're there.

00:24:47.653 --> 00:24:49.613
You don't know that.
I'm so tired... no...

00:24:49.613 --> 00:24:51.115
But they deserve to finger you
just 'cause they're there?

00:24:51.115 --> 00:24:52.700
Yeah!
Yes.
Or if you blow 'em,

00:24:52.700 --> 00:24:54.410
do the move where you
flip around and it's a 69.

00:24:54.410 --> 00:24:56.203
Fingering takes no effort.

00:24:56.203 --> 00:24:59.331
It is so easy to do.
And it's so hot.
It's super easy.

00:24:59.331 --> 00:25:02.209
Girls getting... putting a --
in your head is a lot to ask.
Yup, yup.

00:25:02.209 --> 00:25:04.461
No, I agree, but...
So, then, throw your --
on their face.

00:25:04.461 --> 00:25:05.879
Hmm...
There you go.

00:25:05.879 --> 00:25:06.964
I don't wanna force
someone to do that

00:25:06.964 --> 00:25:08.048
if they don't wanna do it.

00:25:08.048 --> 00:25:10.175
Can you win at all?
(laughs)

00:25:10.175 --> 00:25:12.511
I won't blow a guy till, like,
the second or third time.

00:25:12.511 --> 00:25:13.929
And he'll be, like,
coming at me

00:25:13.929 --> 00:25:15.264
with that, like,
hard -- in my face,

00:25:15.264 --> 00:25:16.515
I'm like,
"Ooh, what's over there?"

00:25:16.515 --> 00:25:18.058
Oh, yeah.
I, like, really distract.

00:25:18.058 --> 00:25:20.102
I've started rejecting it.
Yeah, I'm like, "Nah."

00:25:20.102 --> 00:25:21.687
The guy
I hook up with normally,

00:25:21.687 --> 00:25:23.605
he always is just, like,
it's commonplace that it...

00:25:23.605 --> 00:25:26.483
we, we make out a little bit
and then his -- gets hard

00:25:26.483 --> 00:25:28.318
and then he moves it
up to my head.
Yeah.

00:25:28.318 --> 00:25:30.195
(laughing)
And recently...
Yeah.

00:25:30.195 --> 00:25:31.989
The other day, like,
the last time we hooked up,

00:25:31.989 --> 00:25:33.449
he did it, and I was just...

00:25:33.449 --> 00:25:34.825
I just turned my head
like a baby.
Good.

00:25:34.825 --> 00:25:36.201
Like on a... I was just, "No."
"No."

00:25:36.201 --> 00:25:38.287
Like, I felt like a baby
on the changing table.

00:25:38.287 --> 00:25:40.664
What's happening
to these babies you know?
'Cause you know when, like...

00:25:40.664 --> 00:25:42.207
I don't know, like, you know
when you change a baby

00:25:42.207 --> 00:25:44.376
and they're just like, "No."
"No. No." Yeah.

00:25:44.376 --> 00:25:46.044
And you...
I just, I just was like...
with my mouth,

00:25:46.044 --> 00:25:47.755
because I didn't say it.

00:25:47.755 --> 00:25:49.465
That's why I felt like a baby,
'cause babies can't communicate,

00:25:49.465 --> 00:25:51.091
so I just felt like, "No."
"No."
(laughs)

00:25:51.091 --> 00:25:52.760
Like, I just turned my head
and pretended he wasn't there.

00:25:52.760 --> 00:25:54.011
(Ian)
That's so funny.
I'm just picturing him

00:25:54.011 --> 00:25:55.971
whacking your face
with his --.

00:25:55.971 --> 00:25:58.098
Like, "Come on, come on."
No, he just kinda moved it
around near it

00:25:58.098 --> 00:25:59.683
and realized
I wasn't gonna do it.

00:25:59.683 --> 00:26:01.018
Yeah.
I wasn't ta...
I wasn't taking the bait.

00:26:01.018 --> 00:26:02.770
Nice.
And so then he just...

00:26:02.770 --> 00:26:05.189
He...
like a fish in the water.
He just moseyed on back down

00:26:05.189 --> 00:26:07.983
to finger me, and I was like,
"Good job, good job."

00:26:07.983 --> 00:26:10.486
I am... I am done
giving blowjobs away

00:26:10.486 --> 00:26:12.070
as, like, party favors.
Yeah.

00:26:12.070 --> 00:26:14.823
Like, just because you...
just because you kiss me now,

00:26:14.823 --> 00:26:16.200
and the next step
is me blowing you?

00:26:16.200 --> 00:26:17.951
No, it's not.
Yeah.

00:26:17.951 --> 00:26:19.536
It's not.
No, it doesn't have to be
that way.

00:26:19.536 --> 00:26:21.038
I mean,
I made such a good film

00:26:21.038 --> 00:26:22.331
of me giving a blowjob
that I don't feel like

00:26:22.331 --> 00:26:24.583
I should ever have to
do it again.

00:26:24.583 --> 00:26:26.543
Oh, my God, where it is...
where is this footage?
I should be able to just play it.

00:26:26.543 --> 00:26:28.545
It's on my phone.
You want it?

00:26:28.545 --> 00:26:30.172
I would love to
see your styling.
50 bucks, Venmo. (laughing)

00:26:30.172 --> 00:26:31.715
(Nikki)
Oh, my God.
Truth in comedy.

00:26:31.715 --> 00:26:32.841
It's so weird, because
she's blowing a dude

00:26:32.841 --> 00:26:33.967
but you still can't see
her face?

00:26:33.967 --> 00:26:35.219
Oh, you can see my face.

00:26:35.219 --> 00:26:36.553
You can see
everything too.

00:26:36.553 --> 00:26:37.888
I... are you good
at giving blowjobs?

00:26:37.888 --> 00:26:39.014
Yes, especially
if a camera's on me.

00:26:39.014 --> 00:26:40.349
What's your trick?
(chuckling)

00:26:40.349 --> 00:26:41.767
Oh, I know, yeah.
A, a lot of spit...

00:26:41.767 --> 00:26:43.185
A lot of self-hate.
Oh, I should pretend

00:26:43.185 --> 00:26:44.978
that I'm being filmed.
Yeah!

00:26:44.978 --> 00:26:46.480
That would make me
so much better at them.
More into it, right?

00:26:46.480 --> 00:26:47.731
Yeah.
'Cause you, like,
worry about your angles,

00:26:47.731 --> 00:26:48.982
you do a lot of eye contact.

00:26:48.982 --> 00:26:50.484
I do, like,
the edging thing,

00:26:50.484 --> 00:26:52.152
where, like, you just,
like, suck on the tip

00:26:52.152 --> 00:26:53.779
and keep spinning it, and,
like, just, like, lick it,

00:26:53.779 --> 00:26:55.239
and, like, not go full,
full blowjob

00:26:55.239 --> 00:26:56.490
until, like,
two or three minutes in.

00:26:56.490 --> 00:26:58.200
That is what I've heard,

00:26:58.200 --> 00:27:01.745
is that a lot of girls go in
and they're, they're at a ten...

00:27:01.745 --> 00:27:03.372
They're deep-throating
too early, yeah.
They're trying, they're...

00:27:03.372 --> 00:27:05.582
Too much. No, thanks.
...they come in at a ten.

00:27:05.582 --> 00:27:06.792
A lotta guys do that too.

00:27:06.792 --> 00:27:08.544
You come in at a ten.
Yeah, yeah.

00:27:08.544 --> 00:27:10.671
There's so much to be said
for coming in at a two...
Yup.

00:27:10.671 --> 00:27:12.005
Yeah, build up.
...keeping it at a two...

00:27:12.005 --> 00:27:13.257
Look at you guys
bragging about -- dudes

00:27:13.257 --> 00:27:14.925
with -- long enough
to make a choice.

00:27:14.925 --> 00:27:16.677
(laughter)

00:27:16.677 --> 00:27:18.387
Myka...
(laughing)

00:27:18.387 --> 00:27:21.014
So... I...
sometimes I jerk off alone,

00:27:21.014 --> 00:27:22.349
and I can handle my hand,

00:27:22.349 --> 00:27:23.851
because I'm so used
to my hand.

00:27:23.851 --> 00:27:25.644
I hope you jerk off alone.
I think...

00:27:25.644 --> 00:27:27.563
I hope most of the time
you jerk off alone.
Usually alone.

00:27:27.563 --> 00:27:28.939
You said,
"Sometime, I jerk off alone."

00:27:28.939 --> 00:27:30.357
Well, somet...
I keep the window open.

00:27:30.357 --> 00:27:31.775
You never know.

00:27:31.775 --> 00:27:33.402
A bird, a pigeon.

00:27:33.402 --> 00:27:35.779
A picture... this is like
"Beauty and the Beast,"

00:27:35.779 --> 00:27:37.781
and you're like,
"Hello, Belle!"

00:27:37.781 --> 00:27:38.907
Out the window.

00:27:38.907 --> 00:27:41.368
"Oh, hi, Andrew!"

00:27:41.368 --> 00:27:46.248
♪♪

00:27:46.248 --> 00:27:49.293
So... you're seeing
someone now.

00:27:49.293 --> 00:27:50.419
Mm-hmm.

00:27:50.419 --> 00:27:53.171
Um...
you're hooking up a lot.

00:27:53.171 --> 00:27:54.590
You're... this is the first time
you've been in...

00:27:54.590 --> 00:27:56.341
You're a 39-year-old man.

00:27:56.341 --> 00:27:59.303
38 and... and 11 months
in ten days.

00:27:59.303 --> 00:28:01.221
20 days.
In 15 days, yeah.

00:28:01.221 --> 00:28:04.349
Yeah, so you're... 39.
So, 38.

00:28:04.349 --> 00:28:06.310
Okay.
Give or take.

00:28:06.310 --> 00:28:09.104
I'd give.
Taking it.

00:28:09.104 --> 00:28:10.606
Just take it.
I am.

00:28:10.606 --> 00:28:12.482
39.
38.

00:28:12.482 --> 00:28:15.068
You're in a new relationship
with a 26-year-old.

00:28:15.068 --> 00:28:16.612
27 at some point.

00:28:16.612 --> 00:28:17.863
At some point.
(chuckles)

00:28:17.863 --> 00:28:18.864
Give or take.

00:28:18.864 --> 00:28:20.908
She's 26.
Take.

00:28:21.992 --> 00:28:22.993
Give.
Give.

00:28:22.993 --> 00:28:26.038
(laughing)

00:28:26.038 --> 00:28:28.582
39-year-old man dating
a 26-year-old woman.

00:28:28.582 --> 00:28:30.250
That means you were a teenager
when she was born.

00:28:30.250 --> 00:28:32.210
No big deal.
Um...

00:28:32.210 --> 00:28:34.630
I didn't hit puberty,
though, till late.

00:28:34.630 --> 00:28:37.090
Oh. Oh, okay.
(chuckling)

00:28:37.090 --> 00:28:38.216
Makes sense.

00:28:38.216 --> 00:28:39.760
It does make sense.

00:28:39.760 --> 00:28:41.970
Um...
I had no pubes
when she had no pubes.

00:28:41.970 --> 00:28:43.180
(laughing)
Okay.

00:28:43.180 --> 00:28:44.431
Which makes it fine

00:28:44.431 --> 00:28:45.515
later in life.
Oh, good.

00:28:45.515 --> 00:28:46.767
If there was a point
in your life

00:28:46.767 --> 00:28:47.768
where you both...
Where you both...

00:28:47.768 --> 00:28:49.019
...didn't have pubes,

00:28:49.019 --> 00:28:50.437
then the age difference
does not matter.

00:28:50.437 --> 00:28:51.939
Well, there was
a, a year later, but...

00:28:51.939 --> 00:28:53.607
A year later you got pubes.
But when she was born...

00:28:53.607 --> 00:28:54.733
No pubes.
No pubes.

00:28:54.733 --> 00:28:55.901
In the clear.
Straight up.

00:28:55.901 --> 00:28:57.361
And turned me on more,

00:28:57.361 --> 00:28:58.987
'cause you know
how I feel about hair.

00:28:58.987 --> 00:29:01.073
Right, exactly.
(chuckling)

00:29:01.073 --> 00:29:02.991
Um...
So, yeah.

00:29:02.991 --> 00:29:04.284
So, you're
in a new relationship.
Yeah.

00:29:04.284 --> 00:29:06.244
Uh, is she mature
for her age?

00:29:06.244 --> 00:29:07.537
She has an old, uh...

00:29:07.537 --> 00:29:08.789
(woman laughs)

00:29:08.789 --> 00:29:10.290
...soul.
Soul.

00:29:10.290 --> 00:29:11.875
(chuckling)

00:29:11.875 --> 00:29:14.711
Lot of these young women
walking around with old souls.

00:29:14.711 --> 00:29:16.588
She has been...
she's seen things.

00:29:16.588 --> 00:29:18.048
Yeah.
You know?

00:29:18.048 --> 00:29:19.925
Like Malala?

00:29:19.925 --> 00:29:22.052
Yeah, she's, uh...
she comes from the Sudan.

00:29:22.052 --> 00:29:24.596
No one says, "Malala's young,
but she's got an old soul."

00:29:24.596 --> 00:29:27.265
You only hear about girls
who are Instagram models

00:29:27.265 --> 00:29:28.684
with old souls.

00:29:28.684 --> 00:29:31.103
For some reason,
we're t... we're... really...

00:29:31.103 --> 00:29:34.064
um, celebrating the souls
of all these hot women...

00:29:34.064 --> 00:29:35.607
(chuckling)

00:29:35.607 --> 00:29:37.776
...to justify why older men
are dating younger women.

00:29:37.776 --> 00:29:39.611
"No, but she's, like,
really got an old soul."

00:29:39.611 --> 00:29:41.029
But here's the thing.

00:29:41.029 --> 00:29:42.948
I, I feel like I have
a very young soul.

00:29:42.948 --> 00:29:44.199
That's true,
so you guys, like...

00:29:44.199 --> 00:29:46.159
Old...
old face, young soul.

00:29:46.159 --> 00:29:47.411
Right, right.

00:29:47.411 --> 00:29:48.453
So I think we counterbalance
each other.

00:29:48.453 --> 00:29:50.163
So she's telling her friends,

00:29:50.163 --> 00:29:52.249
"Listen, he is old, but he has,
like... he's really immature."

00:29:52.249 --> 00:29:54.626
"Very old --,
very young soul."

00:29:54.626 --> 00:29:55.919
"Super-old --."

00:29:55.919 --> 00:29:57.170
"And super-old,
disgusting --."

00:29:57.170 --> 00:29:58.422
Mm-hmm.

00:29:58.422 --> 00:29:59.923
"Such a young soul.
I mean, this guy..."

00:29:59.923 --> 00:30:03.301
Does she compliment
your, um... penis?
No.

00:30:03.301 --> 00:30:04.886
She hasn't?
Uh-uh.

00:30:04.886 --> 00:30:06.221
She hasn't said
anything about...
Not even on...

00:30:06.221 --> 00:30:08.473
She said one time, um...

00:30:08.473 --> 00:30:09.850
"Is... it get bigger?"

00:30:09.850 --> 00:30:11.226
No, she didn't.
No, no, no, no, no.

00:30:11.226 --> 00:30:12.936
She... no, she'll say
it feels good.

00:30:12.936 --> 00:30:14.146
She said it feels good?
Feels great.

00:30:14.146 --> 00:30:15.605
Yeah, it feels great.
That's nice.

00:30:15.605 --> 00:30:18.650
Um... but never like...

00:30:18.650 --> 00:30:20.193
"How am I gonna put
my mouth around that?"

00:30:20.193 --> 00:30:21.695
Right, like, you would,

00:30:21.695 --> 00:30:24.072
you would call her on that
if that was the case.

00:30:24.072 --> 00:30:26.158
Yeah, well,
she would have no mouth.
You'd be like, "Well, that's ridiculous."

00:30:26.158 --> 00:30:28.243
She would have, uh, just...

00:30:28.243 --> 00:30:31.121
Maybe... to get it in her
nostril would be a struggle.

00:30:31.121 --> 00:30:33.081
Which one?
She did a lot of coke.

00:30:33.081 --> 00:30:36.293
(both laughing)

00:30:36.293 --> 00:30:38.211
I don't know, yeah, it's good,
though, I don't know.

00:30:38.211 --> 00:30:40.047
It's, it's been fun.
She's cool.

00:30:40.047 --> 00:30:42.132
Yeah, the age difference
I don't feel that much.

00:30:42.132 --> 00:30:43.467
Right.

00:30:43.467 --> 00:30:44.676
I think if she was 22...

00:30:44.676 --> 00:30:45.719
There's a difference.

00:30:45.719 --> 00:30:47.345
I... you tell me, as woman.

00:30:47.345 --> 00:30:50.182
When you're 21, 22,
as opposed to twenty-s...

00:30:50.182 --> 00:30:51.767
I think
once you get past 25,

00:30:51.767 --> 00:30:54.561
you're getting towards 30,
you know?

00:30:54.561 --> 00:30:56.563
Yeah.
Like, there's...

00:30:56.563 --> 00:30:58.523
You've been through that
party phase, most likely.

00:30:58.523 --> 00:31:00.525
You already went clubbing.
Yeah, I, I don't have
a problem with it.

00:31:00.525 --> 00:31:01.943
You're on the tail end
of it.

00:31:01.943 --> 00:31:03.487
I don't have a problem with it,
because it is...

00:31:03.487 --> 00:31:05.155
It's truly the norm,

00:31:05.155 --> 00:31:07.449
that a, a man is 13 years
older than his girlfriend.

00:31:07.449 --> 00:31:12.746
It's, uh... that's, that's...
no one would even... no one...

00:31:12.746 --> 00:31:14.247
It... that,
that's very common.
Yeah.

00:31:14.247 --> 00:31:15.916
The other way around
is not common.

00:31:15.916 --> 00:31:19.127
If I was dating someone who was
13 years younger than me...

00:31:19.127 --> 00:31:20.712
a 21-year-old boy...

00:31:20.712 --> 00:31:22.964
it would be... I would get...

00:31:22.964 --> 00:31:25.759
I mean, they would...
I could never do it.

00:31:25.759 --> 00:31:27.886
I mean, I could,
it'd be legal.
Yes.

00:31:27.886 --> 00:31:29.513
But, like, I would get
so much -- for it.

00:31:29.513 --> 00:31:30.680
But here's the thing.

00:31:30.680 --> 00:31:32.474
If... you could date
a 26-year-old...

00:31:32.474 --> 00:31:34.017
And I know
the age difference,

00:31:34.017 --> 00:31:35.894
but I'm saying
no one would care...

00:31:35.894 --> 00:31:37.604
I know
you're doing the gap.

00:31:37.604 --> 00:31:40.065
I'm 33.
No, no, no... well, 34.

00:31:40.065 --> 00:31:41.858
Oh, that's right,
I am 34.
Give or take, give or take.

00:31:41.858 --> 00:31:43.110
I was like, "Oh, --.

00:31:43.110 --> 00:31:44.736
I usually round up to 35,
to be honest.

00:31:44.736 --> 00:31:47.280
When I put it in the treadmill,
I just go 35.

00:31:47.280 --> 00:31:48.990
I'm like,
"I'm gonna be there eventually."

00:31:48.990 --> 00:31:50.534
There is something
on the tread...

00:31:50.534 --> 00:31:52.285
I don't know, someone's
had to have done a bit

00:31:52.285 --> 00:31:54.496
where you start...
scrolling.

00:31:54.496 --> 00:31:56.081
You know,
when they start at 30,

00:31:56.081 --> 00:31:58.667
or they start your weight
at whatever,

00:31:58.667 --> 00:32:01.086
and you have to scroll
farther away from it.
I buy your plane tickets every week.

00:32:01.086 --> 00:32:05.382
I know how long it takes me
to get to 19...--...72.

00:32:05.382 --> 00:32:07.801
(laughter)

00:32:07.801 --> 00:32:11.096
'80... I'm an '80 baby,
I'm an '80 baby.
I go scrolling, scrolling, scrolling...

00:32:11.096 --> 00:32:12.430
An '80 baby.

00:32:12.430 --> 00:32:13.765
Literally, 1980.

00:32:13.765 --> 00:32:15.100
Mm-hmm.
'80.

00:32:15.100 --> 00:32:18.562
Okay.
What were we talking about?

00:32:18.562 --> 00:32:22.107
This is your first
relationship in...
Yeah.

00:32:22.107 --> 00:32:23.608
...ever?
Ever, I guess.

00:32:23.608 --> 00:32:24.776
Yeah.
As an adult.

00:32:24.776 --> 00:32:26.403
As an adult.

00:32:26.403 --> 00:32:30.907
And... h... and you're also
newly on Zoloft.
Yes.

00:32:30.907 --> 00:32:34.828
And I can't, uh...
come... that much.

00:32:34.828 --> 00:32:36.997
Mm-hmm.
But I feel great.

00:32:36.997 --> 00:32:39.040
Yeah.
So, it's like a very...

00:32:39.040 --> 00:32:40.500
It's a tough dilemma,

00:32:40.500 --> 00:32:42.544
because I've never
worked out more,

00:32:42.544 --> 00:32:46.381
I've never felt more
confident, I've never, uh...

00:32:46.381 --> 00:32:48.341
been more aware and present.

00:32:48.341 --> 00:32:52.846
Mm-hmm.
But the penis is a-not,
a-shootin' anything.

00:32:52.846 --> 00:32:54.681
Right.
But it still feels good?

00:32:54.681 --> 00:32:56.391
Like, you can still...

00:32:56.391 --> 00:32:58.560
Ah... it doesn't get to the
point of, like... pow-pow!

00:32:58.560 --> 00:33:00.228
But do you feel
the frustration of it?

00:33:00.228 --> 00:33:02.439
Are you just, "I can't come!"
But that's the thing!

00:33:02.439 --> 00:33:03.982
You don't even feel that.
I don't feel the frustration.

00:33:03.982 --> 00:33:05.692
So then, what's...
then, what's...
There...

00:33:05.692 --> 00:33:07.694
The only thing
is the other person.

00:33:07.694 --> 00:33:10.280
The what?
The, the person.

00:33:10.280 --> 00:33:12.324
The only thing...
only thing...

00:33:12.324 --> 00:33:14.659
Mm-hmm.
...is the other person's...

00:33:14.659 --> 00:33:16.620
if you're feeling bad
for them.

00:33:16.620 --> 00:33:18.830
Okay.
I mean, sure, I'd like to...

00:33:18.830 --> 00:33:21.750
I gotta say, girl...
we don't really care if...

00:33:21.750 --> 00:33:24.127
Like, if you didn't...
But if it never happens?

00:33:24.127 --> 00:33:25.754
Mm... yeah.

00:33:25.754 --> 00:33:28.340
Then you start to get
a little suspicious of, like...

00:33:28.340 --> 00:33:30.592
A lotta girls will go,
"Well, what's wrong with me?"

00:33:30.592 --> 00:33:31.968
They'll, they'll put it
on themselves.

00:33:31.968 --> 00:33:33.094
Yeah.
I've had that before.

00:33:33.094 --> 00:33:35.138
And say,
"It's just your old soul.
