1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,000
[inaudible].

2
00:00:07,040 --> 00:00:09,890
I get a lot of questions about
automation and delegation.

3
00:00:10,250 --> 00:00:13,190
What should you attempt to automate?
What should you attempt to delegate?

4
00:00:13,490 --> 00:00:17,330
The technologies change.
They adapt and evolve very quickly,

5
00:00:17,390 --> 00:00:21,230
so the tools in the toolkit will vary,
but if you understand the principles,

6
00:00:21,231 --> 00:00:24,560
then you can choose the tools and you
can certainly do homework to find the

7
00:00:24,561 --> 00:00:25,394
latest and greatest.

8
00:00:26,300 --> 00:00:31,300
I'll tell you how I look at this in the
simplest form and one of the frameworks

9
00:00:32,601 --> 00:00:35,870
should sound familiar. If you've read
the four hour work week 80 20 analysis,

10
00:00:35,900 --> 00:00:39,560
I will look at, and I do this
in fact instead of for instance,

11
00:00:39,561 --> 00:00:43,340
New Year's resolutions, I do a review
of my entire calendar previous year,

12
00:00:43,370 --> 00:00:46,340
week by week four.
In this case,

13
00:00:46,341 --> 00:00:51,200
we just came into 2018 I'll look
at 2017 and I will make a list.

14
00:00:51,710 --> 00:00:52,131
In fact,

15
00:00:52,131 --> 00:00:57,131
two lists of the the 20% of people in
activities who produced 80% of my peak

16
00:00:58,730 --> 00:01:01,250
positive emotional states.
That's one list.

17
00:01:01,940 --> 00:01:06,530
The other side of the 20% of people or
activities that produce 80% of my peak

18
00:01:06,890 --> 00:01:11,890
negative emotional states and it could
be as simple as frustration and what this

19
00:01:12,681 --> 00:01:14,180
will help you to put together.

20
00:01:14,210 --> 00:01:19,210
It doesn't have to be at the end of the
year is a to do list or I to focus list

21
00:01:19,221 --> 00:01:21,230
and then a not to do list.
All right,

22
00:01:21,680 --> 00:01:26,680
and I tend to focus on these days at
least taking disagreeable tasks or

23
00:01:28,731 --> 00:01:33,731
distracting tasks and first trying to
automate them with software autopay,

24
00:01:33,950 --> 00:01:37,820
whatever. It might be a repeating
schedule with a task rabbit for instance,

25
00:01:37,821 --> 00:01:39,410
for fiscal pickup or anything like that.

26
00:01:39,680 --> 00:01:43,250
Perhaps you do that through a ups store
that scans and the emails or documents

27
00:01:43,251 --> 00:01:48,251
or earth class mail use technology
whenever possible instead of a brute force

28
00:01:49,280 --> 00:01:50,600
with humans.
Right.

29
00:01:50,630 --> 00:01:53,390
Even if they're humans involved in
conjunction with the technology,

30
00:01:53,780 --> 00:01:56,870
so I'll try to automate
as much as possible first.

31
00:01:57,440 --> 00:02:02,420
Then if we're looking at delegating, which
frequently includes technology, again,

32
00:02:02,421 --> 00:02:05,540
I'll try to remove the
negative as much as possible,

33
00:02:05,541 --> 00:02:09,410
especially with repeating tasks
that is the lowest hanging fruit.

34
00:02:09,560 --> 00:02:14,560
Then I will look at my primary
projects for a given period of time.

35
00:02:15,110 --> 00:02:15,950
And if you have,

36
00:02:15,951 --> 00:02:19,970
let's just say four or five projects
you could pursue or that are in play in

37
00:02:19,971 --> 00:02:21,320
your life,
I will,

38
00:02:21,350 --> 00:02:26,350
I will narrow it down by asking which
of these projects if moved ahead to the

39
00:02:27,651 --> 00:02:32,651
next milestone or if completed will make
all of the rest either irrelevant or

40
00:02:33,950 --> 00:02:35,630
make all of the rest easier.

41
00:02:35,690 --> 00:02:38,300
And I've done this in fact
recently in the last week,

42
00:02:38,660 --> 00:02:40,700
then we have a primary focus.

43
00:02:40,701 --> 00:02:43,520
This is the lead domino that
will make everything else easier.

44
00:02:43,880 --> 00:02:46,460
I will throw as much at that as possible.

45
00:02:46,461 --> 00:02:51,461
So let's just say hypothetically
we are trying to design a website.

46
00:02:52,060 --> 00:02:55,970
Uh, in some cases you want
to throw money at a problem.

47
00:02:55,990 --> 00:02:57,410
It doesn't have to
necessarily be a lot of money,

48
00:02:57,740 --> 00:03:00,820
but throw money at a problem
instead of time times nonrenewable.

49
00:03:00,850 --> 00:03:05,850
So I will say go to 99 designs and get
50 different submissions to brainstorm

50
00:03:06,971 --> 00:03:09,100
ideas for a potential website higher,

51
00:03:09,101 --> 00:03:14,101
perhaps two firms and have them all at
the same time working on designs so that

52
00:03:14,261 --> 00:03:17,970
I can save time and move this project uh,

53
00:03:17,980 --> 00:03:22,960
ahead as quickly as possible with as
few stops as possible. If for instance,

54
00:03:22,961 --> 00:03:26,290
I need a legal opinion. All right,
well I'm going to look for a consensus.

55
00:03:26,291 --> 00:03:29,350
I'm going to look for gaps to
be filled by different people.

56
00:03:29,500 --> 00:03:33,610
I will very frequently have two or three
people work on that at the same time

57
00:03:33,670 --> 00:03:37,420
and then gather the responses again just
to quickly review the not to do list

58
00:03:37,421 --> 00:03:41,730
based on the 20% of activities and
people that tend to produce 80% of my

59
00:03:41,731 --> 00:03:42,880
negative emotional states.

60
00:03:43,180 --> 00:03:47,200
And then the to do list based on
looking at your list of projects and

61
00:03:47,201 --> 00:03:51,730
identifying the project that will
make it the others either irrelevant

62
00:03:52,390 --> 00:03:55,660
unnecessarily to do or easier.
That is the lead domino.

63
00:03:55,661 --> 00:03:58,510
And then I throw as much
as possible at that, uh,

64
00:03:58,630 --> 00:04:01,390
which does not need to
cost a lot of money.

65
00:04:01,630 --> 00:04:04,750
And certainly for me has not caused
a lot of money, even when I was,

66
00:04:05,910 --> 00:04:07,840
I'm not gonna say in the poor house,
but really,

67
00:04:07,841 --> 00:04:09,160
really scraping by and very little.

68
00:04:09,161 --> 00:04:12,190
You can still find ways to do it
because there is talent with overseas

69
00:04:12,400 --> 00:04:13,600
domestically end.

70
00:04:13,930 --> 00:04:18,790
There are many different types of software
that can help you to smooth out and

71
00:04:18,820 --> 00:04:20,860
simplify process to make
a much more elegant.

72
00:04:21,100 --> 00:04:24,100
So those are a few of the ways that I
think about automation and delegation.

73
00:04:24,400 --> 00:04:24,760
Good luck.
