00:00:09.130 --> 00:00:13.940
Not too long ago, the internet was abuzz with news that the ferocious Tyrannosaurus Rex was

00:00:13.940 --> 00:00:18.160
as many news agencies put it, a sensitive and sensual lover.

00:00:18.160 --> 00:00:21.360
Which brings up a couple of questions: first...how can they tell that?

00:00:21.360 --> 00:00:24.660
And second...is this really true?

00:00:24.660 --> 00:00:29.360
Well, the headlines originated from a study found in the science journal Nature, all about

00:00:29.360 --> 00:00:32.720
a new species of Tyrannosaurid called the
Daspletosaurus horneri.

00:00:32.720 --> 00:00:37.780
It is a very long and complicated sounding paper full of long and complicated words that

00:00:37.780 --> 00:00:41.030
covers everything from etymology to anagenesis.

00:00:41.030 --> 00:00:45.540
But skimming over all that fun stuff, you’ll
find a section talking about evidence of small

00:00:45.540 --> 00:00:48.480
openings on the Daspletosaurus’ snout and jaw.

00:00:48.480 --> 00:00:51.640
These holes are the key to all that sensual
loving talk.

00:00:51.650 --> 00:00:53.800
The study believes these holes were nerve openings.

00:00:53.800 --> 00:00:58.200
They noticed they were identical in many ways to bumps called ISO’s found on the snouts

00:00:58.200 --> 00:01:00.480
and jaws of modern day crocodiles.

00:01:00.480 --> 00:01:05.260
These croc bumps are essentially touch sensors that make a crocodile’s face more sensitive

00:01:05.260 --> 00:01:06.660
than human fingertips.

00:01:06.660 --> 00:01:10.780
Crocs will rub these highly-sensitive areas
of their snout and jaw on the body or head

00:01:10.799 --> 00:01:13.560
of their preferred partner in a pre-mating
ritual.

00:01:13.560 --> 00:01:18.270
So, even though we don’t have direct proof that the T. Rex participated in similar mating

00:01:18.270 --> 00:01:22.799
rituals, scientists can make the connection between the bumps on crocodile faces and the

00:01:22.799 --> 00:01:27.789
holes on tyrannosaurid skulls, to deduce that they also rubbed each other down before sex.

00:01:27.789 --> 00:01:31.939
The study also suggests the tyrannosaurids’ sensitive faces could have helped ensure proper

00:01:31.939 --> 00:01:34.710
nest temperatures or to help them gently move eggs.

00:01:34.710 --> 00:01:38.689
But, as we all know, sex sells, so that’s
what the media picked up on.

00:01:38.689 --> 00:01:41.920
Cause you were never going to click on this headline.

00:01:41.920 --> 00:01:46.620
But you might have clicked on something that suggests this:

00:01:48.180 --> 00:01:50.660
That’s graphic.

00:01:50.780 --> 00:01:53.100
Way more graphic than I thought it was going to be.

00:01:53.760 --> 00:01:57.000
So you know how an asteroid is supposedly what led to the dinosaurs going extinct?

00:01:57.000 --> 00:01:59.380
Well, what if that’s not actually what happened?

00:01:59.380 --> 00:02:00.820
