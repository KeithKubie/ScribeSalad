Episode 36: World War II (2) – the war at
home

00:00:01.669 --> 00:00:04.250
Hi, I’m John Green, this is Crash Course
U.S. History and today we’re going to discuss

00:00:04.250 --> 00:00:08.069
how World War II played out at home and also
the meaning of the war.

00:00:08.069 --> 00:00:11.639
Mr. Green, Mr. Green, so is this going to
be, like, one of the boring philosophical

00:00:11.639 --> 00:00:12.639
ones, then?

00:00:12.639 --> 00:00:15.120
Oh, Me From the Past, I remember when you
were idealistic.

00:00:15.120 --> 00:00:22.539
I remember a time when all you cared about
was the deep inner meaning of … mostly girls.

00:00:22.539 --> 00:00:27.619
But, you’ve changed, Me from the Past, and
not in a good way.

00:00:27.619 --> 00:00:36.469
intro
So anyway World War II brought about tremendous

00:00:36.469 --> 00:00:40.940
changes in the United States, in many ways
shaping how Americans would come to see themselves

00:00:40.940 --> 00:00:43.739
and how they would want to be seen by the
rest of the world.

00:00:43.739 --> 00:00:47.690
Some of these ideological changes were a continuation
of the New Deal, others were direct results

00:00:47.690 --> 00:00:52.699
of the war, but one thing we can say is that
by the end of the war, the country was very

00:00:52.699 --> 00:00:53.699
different.

00:00:53.699 --> 00:00:56.679
For starters, World War II strengthened the
federal government of the United States.

00:00:56.679 --> 00:01:00.539
This always happens when a country goes to
war, but World War II brought about even more

00:01:00.539 --> 00:01:03.829
governmental intervention and control than
we had seen in World War I.

00:01:03.829 --> 00:01:05.820
It was like the New Deal on steroids.

00:01:05.820 --> 00:01:10.530
Like federal agencies, like the War Production
Board, War Manpower Commission and Office

00:01:10.530 --> 00:01:14.359
of Price Administration took unprecedented
control of the economy.

00:01:14.359 --> 00:01:18.979
There was massive rationing of food and supplies,
entire industries were completely taken over

00:01:18.979 --> 00:01:19.979
by the government.

00:01:19.979 --> 00:01:23.930
The federal government fixed wages, rents,
prices, and especially production quotas.

00:01:23.930 --> 00:01:29.070
Like, if you’re looking to buy a 1942 model
Ford, or Chrysler, good luck because there

00:01:29.070 --> 00:01:30.070
weren’t any.

00:01:30.070 --> 00:01:33.510
The government told those car makers not to
create new models that year.

00:01:33.510 --> 00:01:36.539
So basically FDR was president for life and
controlled all the industries.

00:01:36.539 --> 00:01:39.429
I mean, how did this Communist end up on the
dime?

00:01:39.429 --> 00:01:43.030
Well the answer is that while it might have
sucked not to have a 1942 Ford, most people

00:01:43.030 --> 00:01:46.360
were just happy to be working after the Great
Depression.

00:01:46.360 --> 00:01:49.929
Unemployment dropped from 14% in 1940 to 2%
in 1943.

00:01:49.929 --> 00:01:54.340
Of course 13 million Americans were serving
in the military in some capacity, so that

00:01:54.340 --> 00:01:55.340
helped employment.

00:01:55.340 --> 00:01:57.990
But in general the war kicked the American
economy into overdrive.

00:01:57.990 --> 00:02:02.950
Like, by 1944 American factories were producing
an airplane every five minutes and a ship

00:02:02.950 --> 00:02:04.020
every day.

00:02:04.020 --> 00:02:10.229
U.S. Gross National Product went from $91
billion to $214 billion during the war.

00:02:10.229 --> 00:02:11.230
Why did this happen?

00:02:11.230 --> 00:02:14.790
Well that’s controversial, but primarily
because of federal spending.

00:02:14.790 --> 00:02:19.030
Government expenditures during the war were
twice the amount they had been in the previous

00:02:19.030 --> 00:02:20.930
150 years.

00:02:20.930 --> 00:02:21.930
Combined.

00:02:21.930 --> 00:02:25.540
Although a lot of this was financed with debt,
much of the war was paid for with taxes.

00:02:25.540 --> 00:02:30.319
Like, the federal government began the practice
of withholding taxes from paychecks, for instance,

00:02:30.319 --> 00:02:34.340
a practice I first became familiar with when
working at Steak N Shake discovering that

00:02:34.340 --> 00:02:39.480
instead of being paid I don’t know, like,
$100 a week, I was being paid -$30 a week

00:02:39.480 --> 00:02:41.370
because I had to declare my tips.

00:02:41.370 --> 00:02:42.900
Because my dad made me.

00:02:42.900 --> 00:02:47.879
Before World War II only 4 million Americans
even paid federal income taxes; but after

00:02:47.879 --> 00:02:49.860
the war 40 million did.

00:02:49.860 --> 00:02:53.709
Also big business got even bigger during the
war because of government contracts.

00:02:53.709 --> 00:02:58.120
Cost-plus contracts guaranteed that companies
would make a profit, and the lion’s share

00:02:58.120 --> 00:02:59.970
of contracts went to the biggest businesses.

00:02:59.970 --> 00:03:05.799
So, by the war’s end the 200 biggest American
corporations controlled half of all of America’s

00:03:05.799 --> 00:03:06.799
corporate assets.

00:03:06.799 --> 00:03:10.189
And all this government spending also spurred
development, like defense spending basically

00:03:10.189 --> 00:03:12.659
created the West Coast as an industrial center.

00:03:12.659 --> 00:03:15.739
Seattle became a shipping and aircraft-manufacturing
hub.

00:03:15.739 --> 00:03:18.600
And California got 10% of all federal spending.

00:03:18.600 --> 00:03:22.000
And Los Angeles became the second largest
manufacturing center in the country, meaning

00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:26.420
that it was not in fact built by Hollywood,
it was built by World War II.

00:03:26.420 --> 00:03:29.819
All of this was pretty bad for the South,
by the way, because most of this industrialization

00:03:29.819 --> 00:03:33.830
happened in cities and the South only had
two cities with more than a half a million

00:03:33.830 --> 00:03:34.830
people.

00:03:34.830 --> 00:03:37.830
And organized labor continued to grow as well,
with union membership soaring from around

00:03:37.830 --> 00:03:41.640
9 million in 1940 to almost 15 million in
1945.

00:03:41.640 --> 00:03:46.049
Besides union-friendly New Deal policies,
the government forced employers to recognize

00:03:46.049 --> 00:03:50.900
unions in order to prevent labor strife and
keep the factories humming so that war production

00:03:50.900 --> 00:03:51.900
would not decrease.

00:03:51.900 --> 00:03:55.599
And, from a human history standpoint, one
of the biggest changes is that many of the

00:03:55.599 --> 00:03:57.569
workers in those factories were women.

00:03:57.569 --> 00:04:01.440
You’ve probably seen this picture of Rosie
the Riveter and while there wasn’t actually

00:04:01.440 --> 00:04:05.280
a riveter named Rosie, or maybe there was
but, she’s an amalgam.

00:04:05.280 --> 00:04:10.780
But by 1944 women made up 1/3 of the civilian
labor force in addition to the 350,000 who

00:04:10.780 --> 00:04:11.909
were serving in the military.

00:04:11.909 --> 00:04:14.420
And the type of women who were working changed
as well.

00:04:14.420 --> 00:04:17.920
Married women in their 30s outnumbered single
women in the workforce.

00:04:17.920 --> 00:04:22.210
But the government and employers both saw
this phenomenon as temporary, so when the

00:04:22.210 --> 00:04:26.420
war was over most women workers, especially
those in high paying industrial jobs, were

00:04:26.420 --> 00:04:27.420
let go.

00:04:27.420 --> 00:04:30.750
This was especially hard on working class
women who needed to work to survive and had

00:04:30.750 --> 00:04:36.220
to return to lower paid work as domestics
or in food services, or, god forbid, as teachers.

00:04:36.220 --> 00:04:37.980
Oh, it’s time for the Mystery Document?

00:04:37.980 --> 00:04:41.270
The rules here are simple.

00:04:41.270 --> 00:04:44.640
We use primary sources for learning as this
is a serious show about history and then if

00:04:44.640 --> 00:04:46.580
I guess the author wrong, I get shocked.

00:04:46.580 --> 00:04:47.760
Okay, what do we got today?

00:04:47.760 --> 00:04:48.760
Let’s take a look.

00:04:48.760 --> 00:04:52.080
Certainly this is no time for any of us to
stop thinking about the social and economic

00:04:52.080 --> 00:04:56.330
problems which are the root cause of the social
revolution which is today a supreme factor

00:04:56.330 --> 00:04:57.450
in the world.

00:04:57.450 --> 00:05:01.760
For there is nothing mysterious about the
foundations of a healthy and strong democracy.

00:05:01.760 --> 00:05:06.690
The basic things expected by our people of
their political and economic systems are simple.

00:05:06.690 --> 00:05:09.420
They are:
Equality of opportunity for youth and for

00:05:09.420 --> 00:05:10.420
others.

00:05:10.420 --> 00:05:11.970
Jobs for those who can work.

00:05:11.970 --> 00:05:13.160
Security for those who need it.

00:05:13.160 --> 00:05:15.510
The ending of special privilege for the few.

00:05:15.510 --> 00:05:17.510
The preservation of civil liberties for all.

00:05:17.510 --> 00:05:20.360
I mean, that’s some pretty hardcore New
Deal stuff right there.

00:05:20.360 --> 00:05:27.310
And, uh, the biggest New Deal-er of all was
FDR, BUT I remember last time when I guessed

00:05:27.310 --> 00:05:31.440
FDR and it was actually Eleanor Roosevelt.

00:05:31.440 --> 00:05:33.900
So.

00:05:33.900 --> 00:05:36.050
You wouldn’t do Eleanor Roosevelt twice.

00:05:36.050 --> 00:05:37.380
Or would you?

00:05:37.380 --> 00:05:38.380
Hm.

00:05:38.380 --> 00:05:39.380
No it sounds more like a speech.

00:05:39.380 --> 00:05:40.380
FDR.

00:05:40.380 --> 00:05:41.380
YES!

00:05:41.380 --> 00:05:44.330
So, I mentioned at the beginning of this video
that World War II was an ideological war,

00:05:44.330 --> 00:05:48.530
and nothing better encapsulates that idea
than FDR’s “Four Freedoms,” which were:

00:05:48.530 --> 00:05:53.930
freedom of speech, freedom of worship, freedom
from want, and freedom from fear.

00:05:53.930 --> 00:05:57.710
During the war the National Resources Planning
Board offered a plan for a peacetime economy

00:05:57.710 --> 00:06:02.530
based on full employment, an expanded welfare
state and a higher standard of living for

00:06:02.530 --> 00:06:03.530
all.

00:06:03.530 --> 00:06:07.430
In 1944 FDR even called for a new Economic
Bill of Rights that would expand governmental

00:06:07.430 --> 00:06:11.910
power in order to create full employment,
and guarantee an adequate income, medical

00:06:11.910 --> 00:06:14.880
care, education, and housing to all Americans.

00:06:14.880 --> 00:06:19.910
As FDR put it: “True individual freedom
cannot exist without economic security and

00:06:19.910 --> 00:06:20.910
independence.”

00:06:20.910 --> 00:06:23.840
But that didn’t happen, largely because
Southern Democrats in the House and Senate

00:06:23.840 --> 00:06:27.770
didn’t want it to because it would have
meant a larger role for unions and also extending

00:06:27.770 --> 00:06:31.780
greater equality to African Americans, and
they weren’t about to let that happen.

00:06:31.780 --> 00:06:36.000
I mean, their jobs were literally dependent
upon African Americans not being able to vote.

00:06:36.000 --> 00:06:40.270
But, Congress did pass the GI Bill of Rights
– officially the Servicemen’s Readjustment

00:06:40.270 --> 00:06:43.980
Act -- to attempt to prevent widespread unemployment
for returning soldiers.

00:06:43.980 --> 00:06:49.240
It worked amazingly well, and by 1946 more
than one million former soldiers were enrolled

00:06:49.240 --> 00:06:54.310
in college and almost 4 million got assistance
with mortgages, spurring a post-war housing

00:06:54.310 --> 00:06:55.310
boom.

00:06:55.310 --> 00:06:57.990
Levittown and all the towns since that look
like it came after the war.

00:06:57.990 --> 00:07:02.910
So, we talked about FDR’s Four Freedoms,
but big business added a fifth freedom – free

00:07:02.910 --> 00:07:03.910
enterprise.

00:07:03.910 --> 00:07:07.440
Advertisers helped on this front, trying to
make the war about consumption, telling Americans

00:07:07.440 --> 00:07:12.190
that they were fighting to “hasten the day
when you … can once more walk into any store

00:07:12.190 --> 00:07:16.690
in the land and buy anything you want,”
according to an ad for Royal Typewriters.

00:07:16.690 --> 00:07:21.260
And FDR’s vision of extending freedom wasn’t
limited to the United States, like Henry Luce,

00:07:21.260 --> 00:07:24.960
the publisher of Time Magazine published a
book called The American Century claiming

00:07:24.960 --> 00:07:29.990
that the war had thrust upon the U.S. the
opportunity to share with all people their

00:07:29.990 --> 00:07:34.720
“magnificent industrial products” (that’s
a quote) and American ideas like “love of

00:07:34.720 --> 00:07:37.710
freedom” and “free economic enterprise.”

00:07:37.710 --> 00:07:38.710
Now, of course, there wasn’t complete agreement
on this liberal, government-led vision of

00:07:38.710 --> 00:07:39.710
freedom.

00:07:39.710 --> 00:07:40.710
Like, Frederick Hayek in 1944 published the
Road to Serfdom, claiming that government

00:07:40.710 --> 00:07:41.710
planning posed a threat to individual liberty.

00:07:41.710 --> 00:07:42.710
And even though he claimed not to be a conservative
because conservatives liked social hierarchy,

00:07:42.710 --> 00:07:43.710
Hayek’s equating New Deal planning with
Fascism and socialism became a foundation

00:07:43.710 --> 00:07:44.710
for later American conservatives.

00:07:44.710 --> 00:07:45.710
The struggle against Nazism also helped re-shape
the way that Americans thought of themselves.

00:07:45.710 --> 00:07:47.221
Like, because the Nazis were racists, Americanism
would mean diversity, and tolerance, and equality

00:07:47.221 --> 00:07:48.221
for all people.

00:07:48.221 --> 00:07:50.700
The federal government supported this version
of America.

00:07:50.700 --> 00:07:55.400
FDR claimed that to be an American was “a
matter of mind and heart,” not “a matter

00:07:55.400 --> 00:07:58.370
of race or ancestry.”[1]
Of course, it wasn’t a matter of race and

00:07:58.370 --> 00:08:01.710
ancestry, we’d already killed 95% of the
indigenous population.

00:08:01.710 --> 00:08:05.500
This was also, not coincidentally, the period
where American intellectuals began publishing

00:08:05.500 --> 00:08:09.110
books debunking the supposed “scientific”
basis of racism.

00:08:09.110 --> 00:08:12.900
Now this didn’t mean that Americans suddenly
embraced equality for all people.

00:08:12.900 --> 00:08:17.090
Anti-Semitism still existed and contributed
to the government’s not doing more to help

00:08:17.090 --> 00:08:18.840
the Jews who perished in the Holocaust.

00:08:18.840 --> 00:08:23.520
In fact, only 21,000 Jewish people were allowed
to come to the U.S. during the course of the

00:08:23.520 --> 00:08:24.520
war.

00:08:24.520 --> 00:08:27.840
And white peoples’ fear over minority groups
contributed to race riots in Detroit and the

00:08:27.840 --> 00:08:31.040
Zoot Suit Riot against Mexicans in Los Angeles
in 1943.

00:08:31.040 --> 00:08:35.310
Not just a song by the Cherry Poppin’ Daddies,
also a tragic moment in American history.

00:08:35.310 --> 00:08:40.169
The war years saw a dramatic increase in immigration
from Mexico under the Bracero program (which

00:08:40.169 --> 00:08:41.769
lasted until 1964).

00:08:41.769 --> 00:08:46.660
And about 500,000 Mexican American men and
women served in the armed forces during the

00:08:46.660 --> 00:08:47.660
war.

00:08:47.660 --> 00:08:51.850
As did 25,000 American Indians although Indian
reservations being largely rural, didn’t

00:08:51.850 --> 00:08:53.819
really share in the wartime prosperity.

00:08:53.819 --> 00:08:59.860
Asian Americans are probably the most glaring
example of the failure to be adequately pluralistic.

00:08:59.860 --> 00:09:03.790
Although things did improve for Chinese Americans
because America couldn’t keep restricting

00:09:03.790 --> 00:09:08.540
the immigration of its ally in the war, Japanese
Americans suffered horrible racism and one

00:09:08.540 --> 00:09:11.660
of the worst violations of civil liberties
in America’s history.

00:09:11.660 --> 00:09:18.311
Executive Order 9066 in February 1942 expelled
all persons of Japanese descent from the west

00:09:18.311 --> 00:09:19.311
coast.

00:09:19.311 --> 00:09:24.790
70% of Japanese Americans lived in California
and as a result of this order more than 110,000

00:09:24.790 --> 00:09:30.910
people, almost 2/3 of whom were American citizens,
were sent to internment camps where they lived

00:09:30.910 --> 00:09:34.160
in makeshift barracks under the eyes and searchlights
of guards.

00:09:34.160 --> 00:09:39.029
A man named Fred Korematsu appealed his conviction
for failing to show up for internment all

00:09:39.029 --> 00:09:44.290
the way to the Supreme Court, where he lost
in yet another horrendous court decision.

00:09:44.290 --> 00:09:45.870
Okay, let’s go to the Thought Bubble.

00:09:45.870 --> 00:09:50.120
The group that experienced the greatest change
during World War II was probably African Americans.

00:09:50.120 --> 00:09:54.220
They still served in segregated regiments
in the armed forces, but more than 1 million

00:09:54.220 --> 00:09:56.200
of them answered the call to fight.

00:09:56.200 --> 00:10:01.439
And just as important, continuing the Great
Migration that had begun in the 1920s 700,000

00:10:01.439 --> 00:10:05.829
African Americans left the south, moving to
northern and especially western cities where

00:10:05.829 --> 00:10:10.050
they could find jobs, even though these mass
migrations often led to tensions between blacks

00:10:10.050 --> 00:10:13.050
and whites and sometimes these tensions exploded
into violence.

00:10:13.050 --> 00:10:15.850
World War II also saw the beginning of the
Civil Rights Movement.

00:10:15.850 --> 00:10:20.449
Angered by discrimination in defense employment,
black labor leader A. Philip Randolph threatened

00:10:20.449 --> 00:10:25.339
a march on Washington demanding access to
defense jobs, an end to segregation and a

00:10:25.339 --> 00:10:27.000
federal anti-lynching law.

00:10:27.000 --> 00:10:32.540
He didn’t get all those things, but he did
get Executive Order 8802 which banned discrimination

00:10:32.540 --> 00:10:36.560
in defense hiring and created the Fair Employment
Practices Commission.

00:10:36.560 --> 00:10:41.430
The FEPC couldn’t enforce anti-discrimination
but as a compliance agency it helped African

00:10:41.430 --> 00:10:45.310
American workers obtain jobs in arms factories
and shipyards.

00:10:45.310 --> 00:10:51.230
By 1944 more than a million black people were
working in manufacturing, and 300,000 of them

00:10:51.230 --> 00:10:52.240
were women.

00:10:52.240 --> 00:10:56.649
The rhetoric of fighting a war for freedom
against a racist dictatorship wasn’t lost

00:10:56.649 --> 00:11:01.810
on African Americans and many saw themselves
as engaged in the double-V campaign, victory

00:11:01.810 --> 00:11:06.519
over the Axis powers abroad and over racism
in the United States.

00:11:06.519 --> 00:11:11.370
The war saw ending segregation and black equality
become cornerstones of American liberalism,

00:11:11.370 --> 00:11:14.170
along with full employment and the expansion
of civil liberties.

00:11:14.170 --> 00:11:18.430
Eventually even the army and navy began to
integrate, although the full end to discrimination

00:11:18.430 --> 00:11:21.240
in the military would have to wait until well
after the war.

00:11:21.240 --> 00:11:22.240
Thanks Thought Bubble.

00:11:22.240 --> 00:11:25.660
So if America was isolationist before the
war – and I’ve argued that it actually

00:11:25.660 --> 00:11:28.850
wasn’t really – after the war it certainly
wasn’t.

00:11:28.850 --> 00:11:34.149
FDR took a very active role in planning for
a more peaceful and prosperous post-war world.

00:11:34.149 --> 00:11:38.920
And conferences at Teheran, Yalta, and Potsdam
clarified war aims, and established the idea

00:11:38.920 --> 00:11:42.569
that Germany would be divided and Nazis tried
for war crimes.

00:11:42.569 --> 00:11:46.420
These conferences also laid the foundation
for the Cold War in allowing Soviet influence

00:11:46.420 --> 00:11:50.149
in Eastern Europe, especially Poland, so that
wasn’t such a good thing.

00:11:50.149 --> 00:11:54.999
But, the 1944 conference Bretton Woods, in
beautiful, freedom loving New Hampshire, established

00:11:54.999 --> 00:11:59.240
America’s economic dominance as the dollar
– which again would be backed by gold -- replaced

00:11:59.240 --> 00:12:02.430
the pound as the main currency in international
transactions.

00:12:02.430 --> 00:12:06.309
It also created World Bank to help rebuild
Europe and also to help developing countries

00:12:06.309 --> 00:12:08.570
and the IMF to stabilize currencies.

00:12:08.570 --> 00:12:12.750
How well that’s worked is debatable, but
this isn’t: the United States became the

00:12:12.750 --> 00:12:15.540
financial leader of a global capitalist order.

00:12:15.540 --> 00:12:19.040
The United States also took a leading role
in establishing the United Nations at the

00:12:19.040 --> 00:12:21.980
Dumbarton Oaks conference in 1944.

00:12:21.980 --> 00:12:26.070
Why do we not have a UN commission on improving
the names of historical events?

00:12:26.070 --> 00:12:27.070
And then America adopted the UN charter, which
was endorsed by the Senate because apparently

00:12:27.070 --> 00:12:28.070
we had learned our lesson after the League
of Nations debacle.

00:12:28.070 --> 00:12:30.470
The goal of the UN was to ensure peace, and
the United States’s position as one of the

00:12:30.470 --> 00:12:35.259
five permanent members of the Security Council
signaled that it intended to take an active

00:12:35.259 --> 00:12:37.420
and leading role in international affairs.

00:12:37.420 --> 00:12:42.240
And we had to because by the end of the war
only the United States and USSR were powerful

00:12:42.240 --> 00:12:43.519
enough to have any influence.

00:12:43.519 --> 00:12:47.209
So, World War II ended the depression and
transformed America’s economy.

00:12:47.209 --> 00:12:51.720
It cemented the new definition of liberalism
established by the New Deal, and opened up

00:12:51.720 --> 00:12:54.230
opportunities for diverse groups of Americans.

00:12:54.230 --> 00:12:57.410
It also transformed definitions of freedom
both at home and abroad.

00:12:57.410 --> 00:13:01.649
I mean, even before the U.S. entered the war
it issued the Atlantic Charter along with

00:13:01.649 --> 00:13:06.329
Britain affirming the freedom of all people
to choose their own government and declaring

00:13:06.329 --> 00:13:11.209
that the defeat of Nazi Germany would help
to bring about a world of “improved labor

00:13:11.209 --> 00:13:14.459
standards, economic advancement, and social
security.”

00:13:14.459 --> 00:13:18.829
At home and abroad World War II became a war
that was about freedom, but was also about

00:13:18.829 --> 00:13:25.050
what Gunnar Myrdal called the American Creed
– a belief in equality, justice, equal opportunity,

00:13:25.050 --> 00:13:26.050
and freedom.

00:13:26.050 --> 00:13:29.540
I want to be clear that we have done a terrible
job of living up to the American Creed, but

00:13:29.540 --> 00:13:35.740
the story of American history is in many ways
the story of ideas pulling policy, not the

00:13:35.740 --> 00:13:36.889
other way around.

00:13:36.889 --> 00:13:40.860
American history is an economic and political
and social history, but it is also a story

00:13:40.860 --> 00:13:42.319
about the power of ideas.

00:13:42.319 --> 00:13:47.060
And World War II helped clarify those ideas
for America and for the world.

00:13:47.060 --> 00:13:48.060
Thanks for watching.

00:13:48.060 --> 00:13:49.060
