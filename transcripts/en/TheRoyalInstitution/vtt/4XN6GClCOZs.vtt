00:00:01.380 --> 00:00:03.780
I had a strange dream last night.

00:00:03.780 --> 00:00:06.760
Three blue cats jumped onto my bed.

00:00:07.400 --> 00:00:12.340
I wasn’t at home but in a hotel at the top
of the Himalayan mountains.

00:00:12.340 --> 00:00:16.890
Bach’s Goldberg variations were playing
in the background.

00:00:16.890 --> 00:00:19.860
And then one of the cats bit my hand!

00:00:20.180 --> 00:00:23.360
It all felt so real at the time.

00:00:23.560 --> 00:00:29.300
Yet when I finally woke up I realised that
the cats, the mountains, the music

00:00:29.300 --> 00:00:34.120
had just been conjured up in my mind’s eye.
None of it was real.

00:00:34.700 --> 00:00:40.760
How had the neurons firing in my brain generated
a sensation of blue cats?

00:00:40.770 --> 00:00:44.730
If I look at the blue of the sky
then I know that it’s blue because of the

00:00:44.730 --> 00:00:47.640
specific wavelength of the light entering
my eye.

00:00:48.260 --> 00:00:52.540
And yet I’d generated that sensation of
blue in my dream

00:00:52.540 --> 00:00:58.620
without the need for any light at all.
How does my brain give me the feeling of blue?

00:01:00.560 --> 00:01:03.800
The sensation of blueness, the sound of the piano,

00:01:03.800 --> 00:01:06.620
and the pain in my hand are all related

00:01:06.620 --> 00:01:08.800
to what we call consciousness.

00:01:08.800 --> 00:01:11.200
The thing responsible for the “I”

00:01:11.200 --> 00:01:13.260
that experiences the world around me.

00:01:14.060 --> 00:01:17.860
As Descartes declared: “I think therefore I am".

00:01:18.580 --> 00:01:20.280
But what is this "I"?

00:01:20.860 --> 00:01:21.960
Where is it?

00:01:23.580 --> 00:01:29.420
The idea that the mind is separate from the
brain is what Descartes called dualism.

00:01:29.800 --> 00:01:33.900
And the duallists love to butt heads with
the materialists,

00:01:33.900 --> 00:01:38.000
the guys who say that there is only one kind
of stuff – matter –

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:43.440
the stuff of quarks, thermodynamics, earthquakes,
photosynthesis.

00:01:44.060 --> 00:01:48.040
Modern brain imaging techniques are today's
telescopes,

00:01:48.040 --> 00:01:50.780
allowing us to look into the brain in action.

00:01:51.580 --> 00:01:54.420
We might be able to identify a very specific

00:01:54.420 --> 00:01:58.440
region that is active
when I think about say... maths,

00:01:58.440 --> 00:02:01.100
or running through a field of grass.

00:02:01.100 --> 00:02:03.440
Or three blue cats.

00:02:03.440 --> 00:02:05.260
That then turned red!

00:02:05.800 --> 00:02:10.240
They can even predict some of my decisions a whole 6 seconds

00:02:10.250 --> 00:02:12.960
before my consciousness becomes aware of them.

00:02:12.960 --> 00:02:17.170
So can they tell us what makes a brain conscious?

00:02:17.170 --> 00:02:20.580
Perhaps I need to go back to sleep to find
out.

00:02:21.140 --> 00:02:27.260
The brain is at its most unconscious in something
called deep stage four sleep.

00:02:27.620 --> 00:02:31.300
No dreams. No feelings. Nothing.

00:02:31.900 --> 00:02:34.180
So can we find out what is different about

00:02:34.180 --> 00:02:36.980
the way the brain works when it is awake?

00:02:43.120 --> 00:02:46.040
Using transcranial magnetic stimulation

00:02:46.040 --> 00:02:50.880
you can switch on neurons in the brain and
see the effect.

00:02:50.880 --> 00:02:54.520
In the awake brain information floods back
and forth

00:02:54.520 --> 00:02:59.400
across the network of synapses and neurons
with an obvious feedback behaviour.

00:02:59.960 --> 00:03:04.160
The unconscious sleeping brain sees none of
these feedback loops.

00:03:04.440 --> 00:03:08.120
This has led to a new mathematical formula
called Phi

00:03:08.120 --> 00:03:12.580
which attempts to measure the difference
in the network behaviour of a conscious brain.

00:03:13.080 --> 00:03:17.240
Does what it means to be “me” come down
to a mathematical equation?

00:03:17.660 --> 00:03:19.380
I like the idea of that!

00:03:20.600 --> 00:03:22.740
But what about other networks?

00:03:23.680 --> 00:03:28.440
Your gut has as many neurons as there are
in the brain of those cats.

00:03:28.440 --> 00:03:30.260
Could my gut be conscious?

00:03:30.920 --> 00:03:34.320
Most of the neurons of an octopus are in its arms.

00:03:34.840 --> 00:03:37.640
So what kind of experience does an octopus have?

00:03:38.020 --> 00:03:41.780
A centralised one or many peripheral ones?

00:03:42.780 --> 00:03:46.000
Could my phone ever identify itself in the
mirror?

00:03:46.180 --> 00:03:52.700
Declare “iPhone think therefore iPhone am."
The internet has a few billion nodes.

00:03:52.700 --> 00:03:58.850
Each node has hundreds of millions of transistors
whose interconnectedness begins to approach

00:03:58.850 --> 00:04:02.180
the interconnectedness of biological systems.

00:04:03.600 --> 00:04:06.840
The intriguing thing is that we are all just

00:04:06.840 --> 00:04:11.280
lots of electrons and quarks
put together to make a human being.

00:04:12.240 --> 00:04:15.850
The challenge is working out how many atoms
you need

00:04:15.850 --> 00:04:19.260
and how do you put them together in order
to get consciousness.

00:04:20.180 --> 00:04:23.640
Maybe there's a magic ingredient that you
need to add

00:04:23.640 --> 00:04:25.700
that we just haven’t discovered yet.

00:04:26.420 --> 00:04:30.540
Or maybe we should think of consciousness in a totally different way.

00:04:30.960 --> 00:04:34.680
More like an emergent phenomenon that can’t

00:04:34.680 --> 00:04:37.080
be reduced to simple building blocks.

00:04:37.480 --> 00:04:41.440
After all one molecule of H2O isn’t wet.

00:04:42.000 --> 00:04:45.720
But put lots together and wetness emerges.
