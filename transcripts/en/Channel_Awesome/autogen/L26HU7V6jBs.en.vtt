set pieces that we've had to build for a

00:00:27.550 --> 00:00:27.560
set pieces that we've had to build for a
 

00:00:27.560 --> 00:00:29.890
set pieces that we've had to build for a
single review there's a ton of work but

00:00:29.890 --> 00:00:29.900
single review there's a ton of work but
 

00:00:29.900 --> 00:00:32.019
single review there's a ton of work but
it was also a lot of fun I was probably

00:00:32.019 --> 00:00:32.029
it was also a lot of fun I was probably
 

00:00:32.029 --> 00:00:34.299
it was also a lot of fun I was probably
gonna build a lot of the props that we

00:00:34.299 --> 00:00:34.309
gonna build a lot of the props that we
 

00:00:34.309 --> 00:00:38.590
gonna build a lot of the props that we
used anyway so it was it was a cool

00:00:38.590 --> 00:00:38.600
used anyway so it was it was a cool
 

00:00:38.600 --> 00:00:41.430
used anyway so it was it was a cool
excuse and a good exercise for me to

00:00:41.430 --> 00:00:41.440
excuse and a good exercise for me to
 

00:00:41.440 --> 00:00:44.380
excuse and a good exercise for me to
delve into and build those props and

00:00:44.380 --> 00:00:44.390
delve into and build those props and
 

00:00:44.390 --> 00:00:46.989
delve into and build those props and
fortunately we also had more time on

00:00:46.989 --> 00:00:46.999
fortunately we also had more time on
 

00:00:46.999 --> 00:00:50.349
fortunately we also had more time on
that particular review to focus on

00:00:50.349 --> 00:00:50.359
that particular review to focus on
 

00:00:50.359 --> 00:00:51.969
that particular review to focus on
building some of the props and the

00:00:51.969 --> 00:00:51.979
building some of the props and the
 

00:00:51.979 --> 00:00:53.979
building some of the props and the
costumes and stuff so in this first

00:00:53.979 --> 00:00:53.989
costumes and stuff so in this first
 

00:00:53.989 --> 00:00:56.500
costumes and stuff so in this first
episode I'm gonna be focusing on the

00:00:56.500 --> 00:00:56.510
episode I'm gonna be focusing on the
 

00:00:56.510 --> 00:00:58.539
episode I'm gonna be focusing on the
first prop that I built for that review

00:00:58.539 --> 00:00:58.549
first prop that I built for that review
 

00:00:58.549 --> 00:01:01.299
first prop that I built for that review
but for me kind of set the tone probably

00:01:01.299 --> 00:01:01.309
but for me kind of set the tone probably
 

00:01:01.309 --> 00:01:04.360
but for me kind of set the tone probably
wanted the build of props and stuff it

00:01:04.360 --> 00:01:04.370
wanted the build of props and stuff it
 

00:01:04.370 --> 00:01:05.859
wanted the build of props and stuff it
was a prop that I have aligned to build

00:01:05.859 --> 00:01:05.869
was a prop that I have aligned to build
 

00:01:05.869 --> 00:01:08.289
was a prop that I have aligned to build
for a long time even before the movie

00:01:08.289 --> 00:01:08.299
for a long time even before the movie
 

00:01:08.299 --> 00:01:09.880
for a long time even before the movie
came out and stuff so it just gave me an

00:01:09.880 --> 00:01:09.890
came out and stuff so it just gave me an
 

00:01:09.890 --> 00:01:12.010
came out and stuff so it just gave me an
excuse to kind of delve right into it

00:01:12.010 --> 00:01:12.020
excuse to kind of delve right into it
 

00:01:12.020 --> 00:01:17.859
excuse to kind of delve right into it
and that prop is that Max's shotgun this

00:01:17.859 --> 00:01:17.869
and that prop is that Max's shotgun this
 

00:01:17.869 --> 00:01:20.740
and that prop is that Max's shotgun this
prop was primarily used by Tamara who

00:01:20.740 --> 00:01:20.750
prop was primarily used by Tamara who
 

00:01:20.750 --> 00:01:23.080
prop was primarily used by Tamara who
was playing furiosa during the review

00:01:23.080 --> 00:01:23.090
was playing furiosa during the review
 

00:01:23.090 --> 00:01:24.819
was playing furiosa during the review
yeah so I've compiled some of the behind

00:01:24.819 --> 00:01:24.829
yeah so I've compiled some of the behind
 

00:01:24.829 --> 00:01:26.289
yeah so I've compiled some of the behind
the scenes footage of some of the

00:01:26.289 --> 00:01:26.299
the scenes footage of some of the
 

00:01:26.299 --> 00:01:29.469
the scenes footage of some of the
elements I used in the process that I

00:01:29.469 --> 00:01:29.479
elements I used in the process that I
 

00:01:29.479 --> 00:01:32.410
elements I used in the process that I
put it together so yeah I hope you guys

00:01:32.410 --> 00:01:32.420
put it together so yeah I hope you guys
 

00:01:32.420 --> 00:01:38.990
put it together so yeah I hope you guys
enjoyed this first installment

00:01:38.990 --> 00:01:39.000
 
 

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:41.999
 
so I started with a piece of conduit

00:01:41.999 --> 00:01:42.009
so I started with a piece of conduit
 

00:01:42.009 --> 00:01:47.999
so I started with a piece of conduit
that I cut into two 12 inch lengths as

00:01:47.999 --> 00:01:48.009
that I cut into two 12 inch lengths as
 

00:01:48.009 --> 00:01:49.499
that I cut into two 12 inch lengths as
you can see there I think I used

00:01:49.499 --> 00:01:49.509
you can see there I think I used
 

00:01:49.509 --> 00:01:52.109
you can see there I think I used
three-quarter inch and then I've got two

00:01:52.109 --> 00:01:52.119
three-quarter inch and then I've got two
 

00:01:52.119 --> 00:01:55.980
three-quarter inch and then I've got two
pieces of square tubing ones brass ones

00:01:55.980 --> 00:01:55.990
pieces of square tubing ones brass ones
 

00:01:55.990 --> 00:01:58.139
pieces of square tubing ones brass ones
a little home it's basically just what I

00:01:58.139 --> 00:01:58.149
a little home it's basically just what I
 

00:01:58.149 --> 00:02:02.160
a little home it's basically just what I
had so I used the smaller piece to

00:02:02.160 --> 00:02:02.170
had so I used the smaller piece to
 

00:02:02.170 --> 00:02:04.800
had so I used the smaller piece to
create a spacer between the two pieces

00:02:04.800 --> 00:02:04.810
create a spacer between the two pieces
 

00:02:04.810 --> 00:02:09.120
create a spacer between the two pieces
of conduit and I glued it using j-b weld

00:02:09.120 --> 00:02:09.130
of conduit and I glued it using j-b weld
 

00:02:09.130 --> 00:02:12.120
of conduit and I glued it using j-b weld
or I think I used JB quick which just

00:02:12.120 --> 00:02:12.130
or I think I used JB quick which just
 

00:02:12.130 --> 00:02:13.979
or I think I used JB quick which just
activates a little faster but it's a

00:02:13.979 --> 00:02:13.989
activates a little faster but it's a
 

00:02:13.989 --> 00:02:19.550
activates a little faster but it's a
really good adhesive for adhering metals

00:02:19.550 --> 00:02:19.560
really good adhesive for adhering metals
 

00:02:19.560 --> 00:02:27.830
really good adhesive for adhering metals
so this is the two pieces combined and

00:02:27.830 --> 00:02:27.840
 
 

00:02:27.840 --> 00:02:33.860
 
then once that was cured add a piece of

00:02:33.860 --> 00:02:33.870
then once that was cured add a piece of
 

00:02:33.870 --> 00:02:37.050
then once that was cured add a piece of
epoxy putty of a plumber's epoxy putty

00:02:37.050 --> 00:02:37.060
epoxy putty of a plumber's epoxy putty
 

00:02:37.060 --> 00:02:42.270
epoxy putty of a plumber's epoxy putty
and said the larger square tubing on top

00:02:42.270 --> 00:02:42.280
and said the larger square tubing on top
 

00:02:42.280 --> 00:02:45.630
and said the larger square tubing on top
of that to kind of get where I wanted it

00:02:45.630 --> 00:02:45.640
of that to kind of get where I wanted it
 

00:02:45.640 --> 00:02:49.190
of that to kind of get where I wanted it
make sure it was flat and it was even

00:02:49.190 --> 00:02:49.200
make sure it was flat and it was even
 

00:02:49.200 --> 00:02:52.770
make sure it was flat and it was even
all the way across

00:02:52.770 --> 00:02:52.780
 
 

00:02:52.780 --> 00:02:56.500
 
so that then I could fill in that gap

00:02:56.500 --> 00:02:56.510
so that then I could fill in that gap
 

00:02:56.510 --> 00:02:58.690
so that then I could fill in that gap
between the square tubing and the

00:02:58.690 --> 00:02:58.700
between the square tubing and the
 

00:02:58.700 --> 00:03:02.230
between the square tubing and the
conduit with more jb weld it's a

00:03:02.230 --> 00:03:02.240
conduit with more jb weld it's a
 

00:03:02.240 --> 00:03:06.790
conduit with more jb weld it's a
two-part epoxy that you can mix up you

00:03:06.790 --> 00:03:06.800
two-part epoxy that you can mix up you
 

00:03:06.800 --> 00:03:09.190
two-part epoxy that you can mix up you
lay it in pour it in brush it in however

00:03:09.190 --> 00:03:09.200
lay it in pour it in brush it in however
 

00:03:09.200 --> 00:03:13.120
lay it in pour it in brush it in however
you want and then you've got some time

00:03:13.120 --> 00:03:13.130
you want and then you've got some time
 

00:03:13.130 --> 00:03:16.030
you want and then you've got some time
you can kind of smooth it out which is

00:03:16.030 --> 00:03:16.040
you can kind of smooth it out which is
 

00:03:16.040 --> 00:03:19.210
you can kind of smooth it out which is
what I did there and you can kind of see

00:03:19.210 --> 00:03:19.220
what I did there and you can kind of see
 

00:03:19.220 --> 00:03:21.130
what I did there and you can kind of see
there's some bubbles and stuff I think I

00:03:21.130 --> 00:03:21.140
there's some bubbles and stuff I think I
 

00:03:21.140 --> 00:03:23.020
there's some bubbles and stuff I think I
hadn't even wanted to cut two or three

00:03:23.020 --> 00:03:23.030
hadn't even wanted to cut two or three
 

00:03:23.030 --> 00:03:24.910
hadn't even wanted to cut two or three
coats or whatever they kind of would

00:03:24.910 --> 00:03:24.920
coats or whatever they kind of would
 

00:03:24.920 --> 00:03:26.530
coats or whatever they kind of would
settle in and then I would put another

00:03:26.530 --> 00:03:26.540
settle in and then I would put another
 

00:03:26.540 --> 00:03:32.890
settle in and then I would put another
thin bead kind of smooth it out but yeah

00:03:32.890 --> 00:03:32.900
thin bead kind of smooth it out but yeah
 

00:03:32.900 --> 00:03:36.690
thin bead kind of smooth it out but yeah
then once that cures I cut out the

00:03:36.690 --> 00:03:36.700
then once that cures I cut out the
 

00:03:36.700 --> 00:03:41.200
then once that cures I cut out the
handle and all like the wood pieces the

00:03:41.200 --> 00:03:41.210
handle and all like the wood pieces the
 

00:03:41.210 --> 00:03:44.260
handle and all like the wood pieces the
hand the handle itself and then the

00:03:44.260 --> 00:03:44.270
hand the handle itself and then the
 

00:03:44.270 --> 00:03:47.560
hand the handle itself and then the
forward grip and cut out of a piece of

00:03:47.560 --> 00:03:47.570
forward grip and cut out of a piece of
 

00:03:47.570 --> 00:03:51.120
forward grip and cut out of a piece of
2x4 and just sanded the hell out of it

00:03:51.120 --> 00:03:51.130
2x4 and just sanded the hell out of it
 

00:03:51.130 --> 00:03:56.680
2x4 and just sanded the hell out of it
so and then the brake mechanism the

00:03:56.680 --> 00:03:56.690
so and then the brake mechanism the
 

00:03:56.690 --> 00:04:01.030
so and then the brake mechanism the
hinge piece I just took a piece of scrap

00:04:01.030 --> 00:04:01.040
hinge piece I just took a piece of scrap
 

00:04:01.040 --> 00:04:03.430
hinge piece I just took a piece of scrap
aluminum that I had of a little flat bar

00:04:03.430 --> 00:04:03.440
aluminum that I had of a little flat bar
 

00:04:03.440 --> 00:04:09.040
aluminum that I had of a little flat bar
and a metal spacer that I had that was

00:04:09.040 --> 00:04:09.050
and a metal spacer that I had that was
 

00:04:09.050 --> 00:04:10.810
and a metal spacer that I had that was
about the right size that I was looking

00:04:10.810 --> 00:04:10.820
about the right size that I was looking
 

00:04:10.820 --> 00:04:11.170
about the right size that I was looking
for

00:04:11.170 --> 00:04:11.180
for
 

00:04:11.180 --> 00:04:13.990
for
I had a few different ones and I shot a

00:04:13.990 --> 00:04:14.000
I had a few different ones and I shot a
 

00:04:14.000 --> 00:04:18.000
I had a few different ones and I shot a
screw through it into the spacer and

00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:18.010
screw through it into the spacer and
 

00:04:18.010 --> 00:04:23.050
screw through it into the spacer and
held it there with epoxy putty and

00:04:23.050 --> 00:04:23.060
held it there with epoxy putty and
 

00:04:23.060 --> 00:04:24.640
held it there with epoxy putty and
that's basically what you see there and

00:04:24.640 --> 00:04:24.650
that's basically what you see there and
 

00:04:24.650 --> 00:04:26.080
that's basically what you see there and
then I covered the screw head with the

00:04:26.080 --> 00:04:26.090
then I covered the screw head with the
 

00:04:26.090 --> 00:04:27.640
then I covered the screw head with the
epoxy putty so it wouldn't shift around

00:04:27.640 --> 00:04:27.650
epoxy putty so it wouldn't shift around
 

00:04:27.650 --> 00:04:31.150
epoxy putty so it wouldn't shift around
or loosen or anything and the deck notch

00:04:31.150 --> 00:04:31.160
or loosen or anything and the deck notch
 

00:04:31.160 --> 00:04:33.400
or loosen or anything and the deck notch
in there that groove really serves no

00:04:33.400 --> 00:04:33.410
in there that groove really serves no
 

00:04:33.410 --> 00:04:36.550
in there that groove really serves no
purpose it was just a scrap piece so but

00:04:36.550 --> 00:04:36.560
purpose it was just a scrap piece so but
 

00:04:36.560 --> 00:04:38.500
purpose it was just a scrap piece so but
you're never gonna see it so it didn't

00:04:38.500 --> 00:04:38.510
you're never gonna see it so it didn't
 

00:04:38.510 --> 00:04:44.379
you're never gonna see it so it didn't
matter to me I then decided how I wanted

00:04:44.379 --> 00:04:44.389
matter to me I then decided how I wanted
 

00:04:44.389 --> 00:04:49.780
matter to me I then decided how I wanted
to you like the body of the gun I once I

00:04:49.780 --> 00:04:49.790
to you like the body of the gun I once I
 

00:04:49.790 --> 00:04:51.159
to you like the body of the gun I once I
got there the shape that I was looking

00:04:51.159 --> 00:04:51.169
got there the shape that I was looking
 

00:04:51.169 --> 00:04:53.940
got there the shape that I was looking
for I traced it unto the the wood and

00:04:53.940 --> 00:04:53.950
for I traced it unto the the wood and
 

00:04:53.950 --> 00:04:58.150
for I traced it unto the the wood and
then I cut it and I cut three identic or

00:04:58.150 --> 00:04:58.160
then I cut it and I cut three identic or
 

00:04:58.160 --> 00:05:03.390
then I cut it and I cut three identic or
two identical pieces and a centerpiece

00:05:03.390 --> 00:05:03.400
two identical pieces and a centerpiece
 

00:05:03.400 --> 00:05:05.800
two identical pieces and a centerpiece
as you can see here then the centerpiece

00:05:05.800 --> 00:05:05.810
as you can see here then the centerpiece
 

00:05:05.810 --> 00:05:10.270
as you can see here then the centerpiece
is the one that's got sort of rounded

00:05:10.270 --> 00:05:10.280
is the one that's got sort of rounded
 

00:05:10.280 --> 00:05:13.570
is the one that's got sort of rounded
out notch kind of there and I

00:05:13.570 --> 00:05:13.580
out notch kind of there and I
 

00:05:13.580 --> 00:05:15.280
out notch kind of there and I
pre-drilled all my holes so I knew

00:05:15.280 --> 00:05:15.290
pre-drilled all my holes so I knew
 

00:05:15.290 --> 00:05:19.300
pre-drilled all my holes so I knew
everything was lined up correctly got my

00:05:19.300 --> 00:05:19.310
everything was lined up correctly got my
 

00:05:19.310 --> 00:05:20.920
everything was lined up correctly got my
holes there that's gonna drill into the

00:05:20.920 --> 00:05:20.930
holes there that's gonna drill into the
 

00:05:20.930 --> 00:05:23.250
holes there that's gonna drill into the
hand off

00:05:23.250 --> 00:05:23.260
hand off
 

00:05:23.260 --> 00:05:25.920
hand off
and then that's the centerpiece and

00:05:25.920 --> 00:05:25.930
and then that's the centerpiece and
 

00:05:25.930 --> 00:05:28.830
and then that's the centerpiece and
that's where my locking pin is gonna

00:05:28.830 --> 00:05:28.840
that's where my locking pin is gonna
 

00:05:28.840 --> 00:05:31.380
that's where my locking pin is gonna
slide through you can see it's kind of

00:05:31.380 --> 00:05:31.390
slide through you can see it's kind of
 

00:05:31.390 --> 00:05:38.630
slide through you can see it's kind of
effed up and do a very good job there so

00:05:38.630 --> 00:05:38.640
 
 

00:05:38.640 --> 00:05:42.900
 
here I'm just assembling the pieces and

00:05:42.900 --> 00:05:42.910
here I'm just assembling the pieces and
 

00:05:42.910 --> 00:05:47.480
here I'm just assembling the pieces and
see how they all go and where that

00:05:47.480 --> 00:05:47.490
see how they all go and where that
 

00:05:47.490 --> 00:05:54.570
see how they all go and where that
spacer is gonna fit the brake so there's

00:05:54.570 --> 00:05:54.580
spacer is gonna fit the brake so there's
 

00:05:54.580 --> 00:05:57.030
spacer is gonna fit the brake so there's
my finished handle after a lot of

00:05:57.030 --> 00:05:57.040
my finished handle after a lot of
 

00:05:57.040 --> 00:06:01.080
my finished handle after a lot of
sanding and I drilled a hole and created

00:06:01.080 --> 00:06:01.090
sanding and I drilled a hole and created
 

00:06:01.090 --> 00:06:03.360
sanding and I drilled a hole and created
a notch in the top there and that's

00:06:03.360 --> 00:06:03.370
a notch in the top there and that's
 

00:06:03.370 --> 00:06:06.630
a notch in the top there and that's
where my pin is gonna go or the locking

00:06:06.630 --> 00:06:06.640
where my pin is gonna go or the locking
 

00:06:06.640 --> 00:06:08.880
where my pin is gonna go or the locking
mechanism and that's my pin which is

00:06:08.880 --> 00:06:08.890
mechanism and that's my pin which is
 

00:06:08.890 --> 00:06:11.040
mechanism and that's my pin which is
just a sliding bolt for like a sliding

00:06:11.040 --> 00:06:11.050
just a sliding bolt for like a sliding
 

00:06:11.050 --> 00:06:13.770
just a sliding bolt for like a sliding
latch or sliding lock and I just

00:06:13.770 --> 00:06:13.780
latch or sliding lock and I just
 

00:06:13.780 --> 00:06:15.810
latch or sliding lock and I just
modified it by cutting it down and then

00:06:15.810 --> 00:06:15.820
modified it by cutting it down and then
 

00:06:15.820 --> 00:06:19.110
modified it by cutting it down and then
adding some plumbers epoxy putty for

00:06:19.110 --> 00:06:19.120
adding some plumbers epoxy putty for
 

00:06:19.120 --> 00:06:22.940
adding some plumbers epoxy putty for
that little kinda like

00:06:22.940 --> 00:06:22.950
 
 

00:06:22.950 --> 00:06:27.720
 
and they're right here I'm just screwing

00:06:27.720 --> 00:06:27.730
and they're right here I'm just screwing
 

00:06:27.730 --> 00:06:33.160
and they're right here I'm just screwing
together the body of the gun

00:06:33.160 --> 00:06:33.170
 
 

00:06:33.170 --> 00:06:37.190
 
you can see that I have to cut off the

00:06:37.190 --> 00:06:37.200
you can see that I have to cut off the
 

00:06:37.200 --> 00:06:40.700
you can see that I have to cut off the
end pieces but kind of just testing it

00:06:40.700 --> 00:06:40.710
end pieces but kind of just testing it
 

00:06:40.710 --> 00:06:41.840
end pieces but kind of just testing it
out I wanted to put all the pieces

00:06:41.840 --> 00:06:41.850
out I wanted to put all the pieces
 

00:06:41.850 --> 00:06:43.550
out I wanted to put all the pieces
together and make sure that everything

00:06:43.550 --> 00:06:43.560
together and make sure that everything
 

00:06:43.560 --> 00:06:49.580
together and make sure that everything
fit before because I had to rebuild

00:06:49.580 --> 00:06:49.590
fit before because I had to rebuild
 

00:06:49.590 --> 00:06:52.700
fit before because I had to rebuild
anything anything like that so there's

00:06:52.700 --> 00:06:52.710
anything anything like that so there's
 

00:06:52.710 --> 00:06:54.230
anything anything like that so there's
the spring and that's gonna go inside

00:06:54.230 --> 00:06:54.240
the spring and that's gonna go inside
 

00:06:54.240 --> 00:06:57.710
the spring and that's gonna go inside
the handle like that behind the pin and

00:06:57.710 --> 00:06:57.720
the handle like that behind the pin and
 

00:06:57.720 --> 00:06:59.570
the handle like that behind the pin and
are the pin slides in like that and

00:06:59.570 --> 00:06:59.580
are the pin slides in like that and
 

00:06:59.580 --> 00:07:01.900
are the pin slides in like that and
that's gonna be my my locking mechanism

00:07:01.900 --> 00:07:01.910
that's gonna be my my locking mechanism
 

00:07:01.910 --> 00:07:04.520
that's gonna be my my locking mechanism
lock and release for the the break of

00:07:04.520 --> 00:07:04.530
lock and release for the the break of
 

00:07:04.530 --> 00:07:13.460
lock and release for the the break of
the gun that slice of the hole there

00:07:13.460 --> 00:07:13.470
 
 

00:07:13.470 --> 00:07:17.580
 
and

00:07:17.580 --> 00:07:17.590
 
 

00:07:17.590 --> 00:07:21.690
 
and then this is the barrel where I have

00:07:21.690 --> 00:07:21.700
and then this is the barrel where I have
 

00:07:21.700 --> 00:07:26.490
and then this is the barrel where I have
now added the some screws or the forward

00:07:26.490 --> 00:07:26.500
now added the some screws or the forward
 

00:07:26.500 --> 00:07:31.710
now added the some screws or the forward
grip and there's my brake mechanism so I

00:07:31.710 --> 00:07:31.720
grip and there's my brake mechanism so I
 

00:07:31.720 --> 00:07:35.700
grip and there's my brake mechanism so I
use the jb weld and glue that piece of

00:07:35.700 --> 00:07:35.710
use the jb weld and glue that piece of
 

00:07:35.710 --> 00:07:41.820
use the jb weld and glue that piece of
aluminum to the conduit and then my

00:07:41.820 --> 00:07:41.830
aluminum to the conduit and then my
 

00:07:41.830 --> 00:07:44.610
aluminum to the conduit and then my
spacer there is gonna fit to the body of

00:07:44.610 --> 00:07:44.620
spacer there is gonna fit to the body of
 

00:07:44.620 --> 00:07:47.770
spacer there is gonna fit to the body of
the gun

00:07:47.770 --> 00:07:47.780
 
 

00:07:47.780 --> 00:07:50.050
 
yeah I put some epoxy putty for those

00:07:50.050 --> 00:07:50.060
yeah I put some epoxy putty for those
 

00:07:50.060 --> 00:07:51.400
yeah I put some epoxy putty for those
screws but it wasn't really strong

00:07:51.400 --> 00:07:51.410
screws but it wasn't really strong
 

00:07:51.410 --> 00:07:55.780
screws but it wasn't really strong
enough sigh also I had some JB quit and

00:07:55.780 --> 00:07:55.790
enough sigh also I had some JB quit and
 

00:07:55.790 --> 00:07:59.170
enough sigh also I had some JB quit and
there's the what word grip that I sanded

00:07:59.170 --> 00:07:59.180
there's the what word grip that I sanded
 

00:07:59.180 --> 00:08:00.940
there's the what word grip that I sanded
how the same 2x4 I think that I've

00:08:00.940 --> 00:08:00.950
how the same 2x4 I think that I've
 

00:08:00.950 --> 00:08:04.750
how the same 2x4 I think that I've
sanded a hand a lot of and again it was

00:08:04.750 --> 00:08:04.760
sanded a hand a lot of and again it was
 

00:08:04.760 --> 00:08:09.370
sanded a hand a lot of and again it was
a lot of sanding but yeah pre-drill my

00:08:09.370 --> 00:08:09.380
a lot of sanding but yeah pre-drill my
 

00:08:09.380 --> 00:08:14.080
a lot of sanding but yeah pre-drill my
holes then I kind of design the whole

00:08:14.080 --> 00:08:14.090
holes then I kind of design the whole
 

00:08:14.090 --> 00:08:18.040
holes then I kind of design the whole
thing so that I could break it apart

00:08:18.040 --> 00:08:18.050
thing so that I could break it apart
 

00:08:18.050 --> 00:08:19.600
thing so that I could break it apart
like a real gun I could take out the

00:08:19.600 --> 00:08:19.610
like a real gun I could take out the
 

00:08:19.610 --> 00:08:21.909
like a real gun I could take out the
elements apart in case something broke

00:08:21.909 --> 00:08:21.919
elements apart in case something broke
 

00:08:21.919 --> 00:08:24.460
elements apart in case something broke
and I can replace just that one part

00:08:24.460 --> 00:08:24.470
and I can replace just that one part
 

00:08:24.470 --> 00:08:27.700
and I can replace just that one part
instead of having to scrap it or rebuild

00:08:27.700 --> 00:08:27.710
instead of having to scrap it or rebuild
 

00:08:27.710 --> 00:08:32.709
instead of having to scrap it or rebuild
the whole thing so this is me kind of

00:08:32.709 --> 00:08:32.719
the whole thing so this is me kind of
 

00:08:32.719 --> 00:08:34.839
the whole thing so this is me kind of
testing out the brake mechanism make

00:08:34.839 --> 00:08:34.849
testing out the brake mechanism make
 

00:08:34.849 --> 00:08:36.640
testing out the brake mechanism make
sure it's gonna work before I put the

00:08:36.640 --> 00:08:36.650
sure it's gonna work before I put the
 

00:08:36.650 --> 00:08:43.240
sure it's gonna work before I put the
screws down everything

00:08:43.240 --> 00:08:43.250
 
 

00:08:43.250 --> 00:08:45.410
 
yeah and it's kind of like that's how it

00:08:45.410 --> 00:08:45.420
yeah and it's kind of like that's how it
 

00:08:45.420 --> 00:08:48.319
yeah and it's kind of like that's how it
swivels

00:08:48.319 --> 00:08:48.329
 
 

00:08:48.329 --> 00:08:52.340
 
does lock in pretty good so we're good

00:08:52.340 --> 00:08:52.350
does lock in pretty good so we're good
 

00:08:52.350 --> 00:08:56.990
does lock in pretty good so we're good
you

00:08:56.990 --> 00:08:57.000
 
 

00:08:57.000 --> 00:08:59.579
 
so at this point now I'm gonna attack

00:08:59.579 --> 00:08:59.589
so at this point now I'm gonna attack
 

00:08:59.589 --> 00:09:01.290
so at this point now I'm gonna attack
the forward grip and that piece that I

00:09:01.290 --> 00:09:01.300
the forward grip and that piece that I
 

00:09:01.300 --> 00:09:05.400
the forward grip and that piece that I
added there is gonna fit around the

00:09:05.400 --> 00:09:05.410
added there is gonna fit around the
 

00:09:05.410 --> 00:09:08.030
added there is gonna fit around the
curve of the body of the gun so that

00:09:08.030 --> 00:09:08.040
curve of the body of the gun so that
 

00:09:08.040 --> 00:09:10.620
curve of the body of the gun so that
when it breaks it doesn't swing like all

00:09:10.620 --> 00:09:10.630
when it breaks it doesn't swing like all
 

00:09:10.630 --> 00:09:13.139
when it breaks it doesn't swing like all
the way down it kind of swings down and

00:09:13.139 --> 00:09:13.149
the way down it kind of swings down and
 

00:09:13.149 --> 00:09:18.710
the way down it kind of swings down and
stops very much like a real shotgun

00:09:18.710 --> 00:09:18.720
 
 

00:09:18.720 --> 00:09:33.180
 
stand those screws screwed to the body

00:09:33.180 --> 00:09:33.190
 
 

00:09:33.190 --> 00:09:35.879
 
and I added a trigger guard using a

00:09:35.879 --> 00:09:35.889
and I added a trigger guard using a
 

00:09:35.889 --> 00:09:39.629
and I added a trigger guard using a
piece of aluminum that I bent into much

00:09:39.629 --> 00:09:39.639
piece of aluminum that I bent into much
 

00:09:39.639 --> 00:09:41.790
piece of aluminum that I bent into much
rear guard and then the triggers are

00:09:41.790 --> 00:09:41.800
rear guard and then the triggers are
 

00:09:41.800 --> 00:09:44.639
rear guard and then the triggers are
just they don't activate or anything or

00:09:44.639 --> 00:09:44.649
just they don't activate or anything or
 

00:09:44.649 --> 00:09:46.949
just they don't activate or anything or
there's no springs just pieces of

00:09:46.949 --> 00:09:46.959
there's no springs just pieces of
 

00:09:46.959 --> 00:09:49.429
there's no springs just pieces of
plastic that I cut into triggers and

00:09:49.429 --> 00:09:49.439
plastic that I cut into triggers and
 

00:09:49.439 --> 00:09:55.259
plastic that I cut into triggers and
drill the hole put a pin through it so

00:09:55.259 --> 00:09:55.269
drill the hole put a pin through it so
 

00:09:55.269 --> 00:09:56.490
drill the hole put a pin through it so
they're basically just there they kind

00:09:56.490 --> 00:09:56.500
they're basically just there they kind
 

00:09:56.500 --> 00:09:57.660
they're basically just there they kind
of move but they don't really do

00:09:57.660 --> 00:09:57.670
of move but they don't really do
 

00:09:57.670 --> 00:10:07.740
of move but they don't really do
anything and that's pretty much finished

00:10:07.740 --> 00:10:07.750
anything and that's pretty much finished
 

00:10:07.750 --> 00:10:13.199
anything and that's pretty much finished
elements before painting all right so

00:10:13.199 --> 00:10:13.209
elements before painting all right so
 

00:10:13.209 --> 00:10:14.759
elements before painting all right so
I've been working on this project a

00:10:14.759 --> 00:10:14.769
I've been working on this project a
 

00:10:14.769 --> 00:10:16.470
I've been working on this project a
little bit here a little bit there for

00:10:16.470 --> 00:10:16.480
little bit here a little bit there for

somewhat I to think that I'm most
 

00:10:36.970 --> 00:10:38.730
somewhat I to think that I'm most
disappointed with is that break

00:10:38.730 --> 00:10:38.740
disappointed with is that break
 

00:10:38.740 --> 00:10:41.040
disappointed with is that break
mechanism I wanted to do it more like

00:10:41.040 --> 00:10:41.050
mechanism I wanted to do it more like
 

00:10:41.050 --> 00:10:42.929
mechanism I wanted to do it more like
the the real thing where you kind of

00:10:42.929 --> 00:10:42.939
the the real thing where you kind of
 

00:10:42.939 --> 00:10:45.900
the the real thing where you kind of
flip it to the side and there's a catch

00:10:45.900 --> 00:10:45.910
flip it to the side and there's a catch
 

00:10:45.910 --> 00:10:49.620
flip it to the side and there's a catch
underneath that'll break the the barrel

00:10:49.620 --> 00:10:49.630
underneath that'll break the the barrel
 

00:10:49.630 --> 00:10:53.850
underneath that'll break the the barrel
but unfortunately that was gonna take a

00:10:53.850 --> 00:10:53.860
but unfortunately that was gonna take a
 

00:10:53.860 --> 00:10:55.530
but unfortunately that was gonna take a
little more time because I constructed

00:10:55.530 --> 00:10:55.540
little more time because I constructed
 

00:10:55.540 --> 00:10:58.530
little more time because I constructed
the housing out of wood it was kind of

00:10:58.530 --> 00:10:58.540
the housing out of wood it was kind of
 

00:10:58.540 --> 00:11:00.780
the housing out of wood it was kind of
brittle so when I started to construct

00:11:00.780 --> 00:11:00.790
brittle so when I started to construct
 

00:11:00.790 --> 00:11:03.150
brittle so when I started to construct
it one of the pieces already cracked so

00:11:03.150 --> 00:11:03.160
it one of the pieces already cracked so
 

00:11:03.160 --> 00:11:05.040
it one of the pieces already cracked so
I just scrapped it I rebuilt the center

00:11:05.040 --> 00:11:05.050
I just scrapped it I rebuilt the center
 

00:11:05.050 --> 00:11:07.110
I just scrapped it I rebuilt the center
piece and then I just put the pin in

00:11:07.110 --> 00:11:07.120
piece and then I just put the pin in
 

00:11:07.120 --> 00:11:10.710
piece and then I just put the pin in
with the spring so you just pull it back

00:11:10.710 --> 00:11:10.720
with the spring so you just pull it back
 

00:11:10.720 --> 00:11:13.319
with the spring so you just pull it back
and it's never shot like that and then

00:11:13.319 --> 00:11:13.329
and it's never shot like that and then
 

00:11:13.329 --> 00:11:16.920
and it's never shot like that and then
I've got these toy shotgun shells that

00:11:16.920 --> 00:11:16.930
I've got these toy shotgun shells that
 

00:11:16.930 --> 00:11:20.970
I've got these toy shotgun shells that
came with a toy shotgun and they fit

came with a toy shotgun and they fit
actually perfectly into the barrel and

00:11:24.230 --> 00:11:24.240
actually perfectly into the barrel and
 

00:11:24.240 --> 00:11:27.299
actually perfectly into the barrel and
then you can still close it and you've

00:11:27.299 --> 00:11:27.309
then you can still close it and you've
 

00:11:27.309 --> 00:11:31.710
then you can still close it and you've
got your cool loading and unloading kind

00:11:31.710 --> 00:11:31.720
got your cool loading and unloading kind
 

00:11:31.720 --> 00:11:34.949
got your cool loading and unloading kind

usually I'd do a darker and I worked

00:14:19.440 --> 00:14:19.450
usually I'd do a darker and I worked
 

00:14:19.450 --> 00:14:23.010
usually I'd do a darker and I worked
lighter this time I actually did the

00:14:23.010 --> 00:14:23.020
lighter this time I actually did the
 

00:14:23.020 --> 00:14:26.940
lighter this time I actually did the
lighter brown over the whole thing and

00:14:26.940 --> 00:14:26.950
lighter brown over the whole thing and
 

00:14:26.950 --> 00:14:31.019
lighter brown over the whole thing and
then I just touched up the edges with

00:14:31.019 --> 00:14:31.029
then I just touched up the edges with
 

00:14:31.029 --> 00:14:38.430
then I just touched up the edges with
the red oxide to kind of mirror the

00:14:38.430 --> 00:14:38.440
the red oxide to kind of mirror the
 

00:14:38.440 --> 00:14:40.139
the red oxide to kind of mirror the
effect that when you're you know when

00:14:40.139 --> 00:14:40.149
effect that when you're you know when
 

00:14:40.149 --> 00:14:43.199

wood or whatever then the oils in your

00:14:46.500 --> 00:14:46.510
wood or whatever then the oils in your
 

00:14:46.510 --> 00:14:50.310
wood or whatever then the oils in your
hands are going to wear away the finish

00:14:50.310 --> 00:14:50.320
hands are going to wear away the finish
 

00:14:50.320 --> 00:14:51.480
hands are going to wear away the finish
on the gun so you're gonna have a

00:14:51.480 --> 00:14:51.490
on the gun so you're gonna have a
 

00:14:51.490 --> 00:14:54.810
on the gun so you're gonna have a
lighter kind of finish I like the handle

00:14:54.810 --> 00:14:54.820
lighter kind of finish I like the handle
 

00:14:54.820 --> 00:14:56.310

hands are going to the barrel I primed
 

00:14:59.020 --> 00:15:01.769
hands are going to the barrel I primed
in a black and then all these pieces are

00:15:01.769 --> 00:15:01.779
in a black and then all these pieces are
 

00:15:01.779 --> 00:15:05.010
in a black and then all these pieces are
just black primer and then I went over

00:15:05.010 --> 00:15:05.020
just black primer and then I went over
 

00:15:05.020 --> 00:15:07.680
just black primer and then I went over
it again with gunmetal gray so this is

00:15:07.680 --> 00:15:07.690
it again with gunmetal gray so this is
 

00:15:07.690 --> 00:15:09.420

for mainly one production I've been
 

00:15:14.949 --> 00:15:16.470
for mainly one production I've been
wanting to build this for a long time

00:15:16.470 --> 00:15:16.480
wanting to build this for a long time
 

00:15:16.480 --> 00:15:19.310
wanting to build this for a long time
this just sort of gave me the excuse and

00:15:19.310 --> 00:15:19.320
this just sort of gave me the excuse and
 

00:15:19.320 --> 00:15:21.720
