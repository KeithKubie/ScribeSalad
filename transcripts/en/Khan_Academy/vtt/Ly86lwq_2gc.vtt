00:00:00.574 --> 00:00:01.990
What I want to do
in this video is

00:00:01.990 --> 00:00:04.771
see if we can identify similar
triangles here and prove

00:00:04.771 --> 00:00:06.520
to ourselves that they
really are similar,

00:00:06.520 --> 00:00:09.080
using some of the postulates
that we've set up.

00:00:09.080 --> 00:00:10.930
So over here, I
have triangle BDC.

00:00:10.930 --> 00:00:13.870
It's inside of triangle AEC.

00:00:13.870 --> 00:00:16.010
They both share this
angle right over there,

00:00:16.010 --> 00:00:17.140
so that gives us one angle.

00:00:17.140 --> 00:00:19.020
We need two to get
to angle-angle,

00:00:19.020 --> 00:00:20.980
which gives us similarity.

00:00:20.980 --> 00:00:22.990
And we know that these
two lines are parallel.

00:00:22.990 --> 00:00:24.365
We know if two
lines are parallel

00:00:24.365 --> 00:00:26.770
and we have a transversal
that corresponding angles are

00:00:26.770 --> 00:00:28.290
going to be congruent.

00:00:28.290 --> 00:00:29.980
So that angle is
going to correspond

00:00:29.980 --> 00:00:31.790
to that angle right over there.

00:00:31.790 --> 00:00:32.880
And we're done.

00:00:32.880 --> 00:00:36.180
We have one angle
in triangle AEC that

00:00:36.180 --> 00:00:38.940
is congruent to
another angle in BDC,

00:00:38.940 --> 00:00:40.760
and then we have
this angle that's

00:00:40.760 --> 00:00:44.360
obviously congruent to itself
that's in both triangles.

00:00:44.360 --> 00:00:48.270
So both triangles have a
pair of corresponding angles

00:00:48.270 --> 00:00:50.320
that are congruent, so
they must be similar.

00:00:50.320 --> 00:00:57.050
So we can write,
triangle ACE is going

00:00:57.050 --> 00:00:58.590
to be similar to
triangle-- and we

00:00:58.590 --> 00:01:00.490
want to get the letters
in the right order.

00:01:00.490 --> 00:01:03.030
So where the blue angle is
here, the blue angle there

00:01:03.030 --> 00:01:06.100
is vertex B. Then we go
to the wide angle, C,

00:01:06.100 --> 00:01:11.250
and then we go to the unlabeled
angle right over there, BCD.

00:01:11.250 --> 00:01:12.667
So we did that first one.

00:01:12.667 --> 00:01:14.250
Now let's do this
one right over here.

00:01:14.250 --> 00:01:16.210
This is kind of
similar, but it looks,

00:01:16.210 --> 00:01:19.030
just superficially looking at
it, that YZ is definitely not

00:01:19.030 --> 00:01:21.380
parallel to ST. So we
won't be able to do

00:01:21.380 --> 00:01:23.970
this corresponding
angle argument,

00:01:23.970 --> 00:01:26.360
especially because they didn't
even label it as parallel.

00:01:26.360 --> 00:01:28.871
And so you don't want to look
at things just by the way

00:01:28.871 --> 00:01:29.370
they look.

00:01:29.370 --> 00:01:30.770
You definitely want to
say, what am I given,

00:01:30.770 --> 00:01:31.760
and what am I not given?

00:01:31.760 --> 00:01:33.080
If these weren't
labeled parallel,

00:01:33.080 --> 00:01:34.830
we wouldn't be able
to make the statement,

00:01:34.830 --> 00:01:36.390
even if they looked parallel.

00:01:36.390 --> 00:01:38.920
One thing we do have is that
we have this angle right here

00:01:38.920 --> 00:01:40.820
that's common to
the inner triangle

00:01:40.820 --> 00:01:43.000
and to the outer
triangle, and they've

00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:44.770
given us a bunch of sides.

00:01:44.770 --> 00:01:47.520
So maybe we can use
SAS for similarity,

00:01:47.520 --> 00:01:50.250
meaning if we can show
the ratio of the sides

00:01:50.250 --> 00:01:52.260
on either side of
this angle, if they

00:01:52.260 --> 00:01:55.210
have the same ratio from the
smaller triangle to the larger

00:01:55.210 --> 00:01:58.950
triangle, then we
can show similarity.

00:01:58.950 --> 00:02:02.670
So let's go, and we have to go
on either side of this angle

00:02:02.670 --> 00:02:03.360
right over here.

00:02:03.360 --> 00:02:06.960
Let's look at the shorter side
on either side of this angle.

00:02:06.960 --> 00:02:09.373
So the shorter side
is two, and let's look

00:02:09.373 --> 00:02:10.789
at the shorter
side on either side

00:02:10.789 --> 00:02:12.880
of the angle for
the larger triangle.

00:02:12.880 --> 00:02:16.190
Well, then the shorter side
is on the right-hand side,

00:02:16.190 --> 00:02:18.496
and that's going to be XT.

00:02:18.496 --> 00:02:20.120
So what we want to
compare is the ratio

00:02:20.120 --> 00:02:21.810
between-- let me
write it this way.

00:02:21.810 --> 00:02:29.500
We want to see, is XY
over XT equal to the ratio

00:02:29.500 --> 00:02:31.370
of the longer side?

00:02:31.370 --> 00:02:33.770
Or if we're looking relative
to this angle, the longer

00:02:33.770 --> 00:02:36.540
of the two, not necessarily
the longest of the triangle,

00:02:36.540 --> 00:02:38.040
although it looks
like that as well.

00:02:38.040 --> 00:02:43.792
Is that equal to the ratio of
XZ over the longer of the two

00:02:43.792 --> 00:02:45.750
sides-- when you're
looking at this angle right

00:02:45.750 --> 00:02:47.208
here, on either
side of that angle,

00:02:47.208 --> 00:02:49.746
for the larger
triangle-- over XS?

00:02:51.764 --> 00:02:54.180
And it's a little confusing,
because we've kind of flipped

00:02:54.180 --> 00:02:56.400
which side, but I'm just
thinking about the shorter

00:02:56.400 --> 00:02:59.340
side on either side of
this angle in between,

00:02:59.340 --> 00:03:01.899
and then the longer side on
either side of this angle.

00:03:01.899 --> 00:03:04.190
So these are the shorter
sides for the smaller triangle

00:03:04.190 --> 00:03:05.430
and the larger triangle.

00:03:05.430 --> 00:03:08.740
These are the longer sides
for the smaller triangle

00:03:08.740 --> 00:03:10.240
and the larger triangle.

00:03:10.240 --> 00:03:11.610
And we see XY.

00:03:11.610 --> 00:03:12.870
This is two.

00:03:12.870 --> 00:03:17.400
XT is 3 plus 1 is 4.

00:03:17.400 --> 00:03:24.160
XZ is 3, and XS is 6.

00:03:24.160 --> 00:03:25.810
So you have 2 over
4, which is 1/2,

00:03:25.810 --> 00:03:28.080
which is the same thing as 3/6.

00:03:28.080 --> 00:03:31.090
So the ratio between
the shorter sides

00:03:31.090 --> 00:03:33.160
on either side of the
angle and the longer

00:03:33.160 --> 00:03:36.300
sides on either side of the
angle, for both triangles,

00:03:36.300 --> 00:03:40.590
the ratio is the same.

00:03:40.590 --> 00:03:44.437
So by SAS we know that the
two triangles are congruent.

00:03:44.437 --> 00:03:46.770
But we have to be careful on
how we state the triangles.

00:03:46.770 --> 00:03:51.264
We want to make sure we get
the corresponding sides.

00:03:51.264 --> 00:03:52.680
And I'm running
out of space here.

00:03:52.680 --> 00:03:54.480
Let me write it
right above here.

00:03:54.480 --> 00:04:04.250
We can write that triangle
XYZ is similar to triangle--

00:04:04.250 --> 00:04:07.380
so we started up at X, which
is the vertex at the angle,

00:04:07.380 --> 00:04:09.560
and we went to the
shorter side first.

00:04:09.560 --> 00:04:11.370
So now we want to
start at X and go

00:04:11.370 --> 00:04:14.430
to the shorter side
on the large triangle.

00:04:14.430 --> 00:04:15.404
So you go to XTS.

00:04:19.899 --> 00:04:23.454
XYZ is similar to XTS.

00:04:23.454 --> 00:04:25.120
Now, let's look at
this right over here.

00:04:25.120 --> 00:04:28.860
So in our larger triangle,
we have a right angle here,

00:04:28.860 --> 00:04:31.980
but we really know
nothing about what's

00:04:31.980 --> 00:04:33.930
going on with any of
these smaller triangles

00:04:33.930 --> 00:04:35.390
in terms of their actual angles.

00:04:35.390 --> 00:04:37.140
Even though this looks
like a right angle,

00:04:37.140 --> 00:04:38.540
we cannot assume it.

00:04:38.540 --> 00:04:42.090
And if we look at this smaller
triangle right over here,

00:04:42.090 --> 00:04:44.130
it shares one side with
the larger triangle,

00:04:44.130 --> 00:04:45.770
but that's not enough
to do anything.

00:04:45.770 --> 00:04:47.710
And then this triangle over
here also shares another side,

00:04:47.710 --> 00:04:49.221
but that also
doesn't do anything.

00:04:49.221 --> 00:04:50.970
So we really can't
make any statement here

00:04:50.970 --> 00:04:52.590
about any kind of similarity.

00:04:52.590 --> 00:04:54.280
So there's no similarity
going on here.

00:04:57.500 --> 00:04:59.300
There are some shared angles.

00:04:59.300 --> 00:05:01.723
This guy-- they both share
that angle, the larger triangle

00:05:01.723 --> 00:05:02.690
and the smaller triangle.

00:05:02.690 --> 00:05:04.110
So there could be a
statement of similarity

00:05:04.110 --> 00:05:06.260
we could make if we knew
that this definitely

00:05:06.260 --> 00:05:07.360
was a right angle.

00:05:07.360 --> 00:05:09.276
Then we could make some
interesting statements

00:05:09.276 --> 00:05:10.740
about similarity,
but right now, we

00:05:10.740 --> 00:05:14.130
can't really do anything as is.

00:05:14.130 --> 00:05:16.214
Let's try this one out,
this pair right over here.

00:05:16.214 --> 00:05:18.255
So these are the first
ones that we have actually

00:05:18.255 --> 00:05:19.610
separated out the triangles.

00:05:19.610 --> 00:05:21.910
So they've given us the three
sides of both triangles.

00:05:21.910 --> 00:05:23.590
So let's just figure
out if the ratios

00:05:23.590 --> 00:05:26.460
between corresponding
sides are a constant.

00:05:26.460 --> 00:05:28.580
So let's start with
the short side.

00:05:28.580 --> 00:05:30.370
So the short side here is 3.

00:05:30.370 --> 00:05:33.960
The shortest side here
is 9 square roots of 3.

00:05:33.960 --> 00:05:37.340
So we want to see whether the
ratio of 3 to 9 square roots

00:05:37.340 --> 00:05:42.220
of 3 is equal to the next
longest side over here,

00:05:42.220 --> 00:05:49.170
is 3 square roots of 3 over the
next longest side over here,

00:05:49.170 --> 00:05:49.845
which is 27.

00:05:53.030 --> 00:05:54.820
And then see if
that's going to be

00:05:54.820 --> 00:05:59.240
equal to the ratio
of the longest side.

00:05:59.240 --> 00:06:02.590
So the longest side
here is 6, and then

00:06:02.590 --> 00:06:05.390
the longest side over here
is 18 square roots of 3.

00:06:08.070 --> 00:06:12.220
So this is going to give
us-- let's see, this is 3.

00:06:12.220 --> 00:06:15.050
Let me do this in
a neutral color.

00:06:15.050 --> 00:06:19.140
So this becomes 1 over
3 square roots of 3.

00:06:19.140 --> 00:06:26.541
This becomes 1
over root 3 over 9,

00:06:26.541 --> 00:06:28.040
which seems like a
different number,

00:06:28.040 --> 00:06:30.180
but we want to be careful here.

00:06:30.180 --> 00:06:34.690
And then this right over here--
if you divide the numerator

00:06:34.690 --> 00:06:36.170
and denominator
by 6, this becomes

00:06:36.170 --> 00:06:38.580
a 1 and this becomes
3 square roots of 3.

00:06:38.580 --> 00:06:46.940
So 1 over 3 root 3 needs to
be equal to square root of 3

00:06:46.940 --> 00:06:53.020
over 9, which needs to be equal
to 1 over 3 square roots of 3.

00:06:53.020 --> 00:06:55.220
At first they don't look
equal, but we can actually

00:06:55.220 --> 00:06:57.290
rationalize this
denominator right over here.

00:06:57.290 --> 00:07:00.130
We can show that 1 over
3 square roots of 3,

00:07:00.130 --> 00:07:02.150
if you multiply it
by square root of 3

00:07:02.150 --> 00:07:04.250
over square root
of 3, this actually

00:07:04.250 --> 00:07:06.750
gives you in the
numerator square root of 3

00:07:06.750 --> 00:07:10.140
over square root of 3 times
square root of 3 is 3, times 3

00:07:10.140 --> 00:07:11.280
is 9.

00:07:11.280 --> 00:07:13.190
So these actually
are all the same.

00:07:13.190 --> 00:07:15.082
This is actually
saying, this is 1 over 3

00:07:15.082 --> 00:07:17.540
root 3, which is the same thing
as square root of 3 over 9,

00:07:17.540 --> 00:07:19.039
which is this right
over here, which

00:07:19.039 --> 00:07:21.230
is the same thing
as 1 over 3 root 3.

00:07:21.230 --> 00:07:24.120
So actually, these
are similar triangles.

00:07:24.120 --> 00:07:25.760
So we can actually
say it, and I'll

00:07:25.760 --> 00:07:27.360
make sure I get the order right.

00:07:27.360 --> 00:07:29.600
So let's start with E,
which is between the blue

00:07:29.600 --> 00:07:31.010
and the magenta side.

00:07:31.010 --> 00:07:33.780
So that's between the
blue and the magenta side.

00:07:33.780 --> 00:07:36.010
That is H, right over here.

00:07:38.690 --> 00:07:40.500
I'll do it like this.

00:07:40.500 --> 00:07:50.830
Triangle E, and then I'll
go along the blue side, F.

00:07:50.830 --> 00:07:52.720
Actually, let me just
write it this way.

00:07:52.720 --> 00:07:57.340
Triangle EFG, we know
is similar to triangle--

00:07:57.340 --> 00:07:59.780
So E is between the blue
and the magenta side.

00:07:59.780 --> 00:08:03.180
Blue and magenta side--
that is H. And then we

00:08:03.180 --> 00:08:08.470
go along the blue side to F,
go along the blue side to I,

00:08:08.470 --> 00:08:10.660
and then you went along
the orange side to G,

00:08:10.660 --> 00:08:13.110
and then you go along
the orange side to J.

00:08:13.110 --> 00:08:18.070
So triangle EFJ-- EFG is
similar to triangle HIJ

00:08:18.070 --> 00:08:20.570
by side-side-side similarity.

00:08:20.570 --> 00:08:22.030
They're not congruent sides.

00:08:22.030 --> 00:08:24.700
They all have just the same
ratio or the same scaling

00:08:24.700 --> 00:08:25.910
factor.

00:08:25.910 --> 00:08:27.755
Now let's do this last
one, right over here.

00:08:30.120 --> 00:08:30.620
Let's see.

00:08:30.620 --> 00:08:33.309
We have an angle that's
congruent to another angle

00:08:33.309 --> 00:08:36.490
right over there, and
we have two sides.

00:08:36.490 --> 00:08:38.870
And so it might be tempting
to use side-angle-side,

00:08:38.870 --> 00:08:41.210
because we have
side-angle-side here.

00:08:41.210 --> 00:08:44.204
And even the ratios look kind
of tempting, because 4 times 2

00:08:44.204 --> 00:08:44.703
is 8.

00:08:44.703 --> 00:08:46.460
5 times 2 is 10.

00:08:46.460 --> 00:08:48.720
But it's tricky
here, because they

00:08:48.720 --> 00:08:50.315
aren't the same
corresponding sides.

00:08:50.315 --> 00:08:52.440
In order to use side-angle-side,
the two sides that

00:08:52.440 --> 00:08:54.740
have the same
corresponding ratios,

00:08:54.740 --> 00:08:56.820
they have to be on
either side of the angle.

00:08:56.820 --> 00:08:59.090
So in this case, they are
on either side of the angle.

00:08:59.090 --> 00:09:01.250
In this case, the 4 is
on one side of the angle,

00:09:01.250 --> 00:09:04.190
but the 5 is not.

00:09:04.190 --> 00:09:07.430
So because if this
5 was over here,

00:09:07.430 --> 00:09:09.605
then we could make an
argument for similarity,

00:09:09.605 --> 00:09:12.230
but with this 5 not being on the
other side of the angle-- it's

00:09:12.230 --> 00:09:14.140
not sandwiching the
angle with the 4--

00:09:14.140 --> 00:09:15.680
we can't use side-angle-side.

00:09:15.680 --> 00:09:18.800
And frankly, there's nothing
that we can do over here.

00:09:18.800 --> 00:09:20.790
So we can't make
some strong statement

00:09:20.790 --> 00:09:23.760
about similarity
for this last one.
