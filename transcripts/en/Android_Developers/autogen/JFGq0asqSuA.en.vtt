here we're here to talk about a little

00:00:12.350 --> 00:00:12.360
here we're here to talk about a little
 

00:00:12.360 --> 00:00:15.740
here we're here to talk about a little
thing called navigation now what what is

00:00:15.740 --> 00:00:15.750
thing called navigation now what what is
 

00:00:15.750 --> 00:00:18.080
thing called navigation now what what is
navigation um if you're here for Google

00:00:18.080 --> 00:00:18.090
navigation um if you're here for Google
 

00:00:18.090 --> 00:00:20.290
navigation um if you're here for Google
Maps you're not in the right talk

00:00:20.290 --> 00:00:20.300
Maps you're not in the right talk
 

00:00:20.300 --> 00:00:22.130
Maps you're not in the right talk
because today we'll be talking

00:00:22.130 --> 00:00:22.140
because today we'll be talking
 

00:00:22.140 --> 00:00:23.900
because today we'll be talking
specifically about the jetpack

00:00:23.900 --> 00:00:23.910
specifically about the jetpack
 

00:00:23.910 --> 00:00:26.890
specifically about the jetpack
navigation component now when we say

00:00:26.890 --> 00:00:26.900
navigation component now when we say
 

00:00:26.900 --> 00:00:28.939
navigation component now when we say
component what does that actually mean

00:00:28.939 --> 00:00:28.949
component what does that actually mean
 

00:00:28.949 --> 00:00:31.189
component what does that actually mean
well let's look at what the mission

00:00:31.189 --> 00:00:31.199
well let's look at what the mission
 

00:00:31.199 --> 00:00:32.900
well let's look at what the mission
statement for jetpack navigation

00:00:32.900 --> 00:00:32.910
statement for jetpack navigation
 

00:00:32.910 --> 00:00:36.400
statement for jetpack navigation
actually is so it's a suite of libraries

00:00:36.400 --> 00:00:36.410
actually is so it's a suite of libraries
 

00:00:36.410 --> 00:00:40.069
actually is so it's a suite of libraries
tooling and guidance that provide a

00:00:40.069 --> 00:00:40.079
tooling and guidance that provide a
 

00:00:40.079 --> 00:00:42.650
tooling and guidance that provide a
robust navigation framework for in-app

00:00:42.650 --> 00:00:42.660
robust navigation framework for in-app
 

00:00:42.660 --> 00:00:45.650
robust navigation framework for in-app
navigation so a very specific goal is

00:00:45.650 --> 00:00:45.660
navigation so a very specific goal is
 

00:00:45.660 --> 00:00:47.360
navigation so a very specific goal is
kind of that in-app nation that

00:00:47.360 --> 00:00:47.370
kind of that in-app nation that
 

00:00:47.370 --> 00:00:49.790
kind of that in-app nation that
navigation between screens and provide

00:00:49.790 --> 00:00:49.800
navigation between screens and provide
 

00:00:49.800 --> 00:00:52.069
navigation between screens and provide
more than just the libraries but also

00:00:52.069 --> 00:00:52.079
more than just the libraries but also
 

00:00:52.079 --> 00:00:54.139
more than just the libraries but also
tooling and guidance to go along with

00:00:54.139 --> 00:00:54.149
tooling and guidance to go along with
 

00:00:54.149 --> 00:00:57.260
tooling and guidance to go along with
that so I think it's best to kind of

00:00:57.260 --> 00:00:57.270
that so I think it's best to kind of
 

00:00:57.270 --> 00:01:00.860
that so I think it's best to kind of
explain navigation with a sample app so

00:01:00.860 --> 00:01:00.870
explain navigation with a sample app so
 

00:01:00.870 --> 00:01:02.420
explain navigation with a sample app so
here we're going to build a trivia app

00:01:02.420 --> 00:01:02.430
here we're going to build a trivia app
 

00:01:02.430 --> 00:01:05.149
here we're going to build a trivia app
and because I'm a Googler and of course

00:01:05.149 --> 00:01:05.159
and because I'm a Googler and of course
 

00:01:05.159 --> 00:01:08.690
and because I'm a Googler and of course
has chat built in so we have a chat list

00:01:08.690 --> 00:01:08.700
has chat built in so we have a chat list
 

00:01:08.700 --> 00:01:11.390
has chat built in so we have a chat list
size all of your conversations and then

00:01:11.390 --> 00:01:11.400
size all of your conversations and then
 

00:01:11.400 --> 00:01:13.219
size all of your conversations and then
of course a chat fragment which will

00:01:13.219 --> 00:01:13.229
of course a chat fragment which will
 

00:01:13.229 --> 00:01:14.660
of course a chat fragment which will
actually have the actual conversation

00:01:14.660 --> 00:01:14.670
actually have the actual conversation
 

00:01:14.670 --> 00:01:18.020
actually have the actual conversation
itself and of course a profile and all

00:01:18.020 --> 00:01:18.030
itself and of course a profile and all
 

00:01:18.030 --> 00:01:20.480
itself and of course a profile and all
these will be available via a navigation

00:01:20.480 --> 00:01:20.490
these will be available via a navigation
 

00:01:20.490 --> 00:01:23.990
these will be available via a navigation
drawer on our main activity so we chose

00:01:23.990 --> 00:01:24.000
drawer on our main activity so we chose
 

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:26.780
drawer on our main activity so we chose
fragments here because they provide a

00:01:26.780 --> 00:01:26.790
fragments here because they provide a
 

00:01:26.790 --> 00:01:28.190
fragments here because they provide a
really good integration with other

00:01:28.190 --> 00:01:28.200
really good integration with other
 

00:01:28.200 --> 00:01:30.140
really good integration with other
architecture components like view models

00:01:30.140 --> 00:01:30.150
architecture components like view models
 

00:01:30.150 --> 00:01:33.020
architecture components like view models
and life cycle and to kind of actually

00:01:33.020 --> 00:01:33.030
and life cycle and to kind of actually
 

00:01:33.030 --> 00:01:36.200
and life cycle and to kind of actually
make this all work we're putting all of

00:01:36.200 --> 00:01:36.210
make this all work we're putting all of
 

00:01:36.210 --> 00:01:39.080
make this all work we're putting all of
these fragments in a now host fragment

00:01:39.080 --> 00:01:39.090
these fragments in a now host fragment
 

00:01:39.090 --> 00:01:41.240
these fragments in a now host fragment
so this is the thing that navigation

00:01:41.240 --> 00:01:41.250
so this is the thing that navigation
 

00:01:41.250 --> 00:01:43.190
so this is the thing that navigation
provides for you which is basically the

00:01:43.190 --> 00:01:43.200
provides for you which is basically the
 

00:01:43.200 --> 00:01:45.950
provides for you which is basically the
container where as we swap between these

00:01:45.950 --> 00:01:45.960
container where as we swap between these
 

00:01:45.960 --> 00:01:48.109
container where as we swap between these
different screens in our app the now

00:01:48.109 --> 00:01:48.119
different screens in our app the now
 

00:01:48.119 --> 00:01:50.120
different screens in our app the now
host fragment is what's actually going

00:01:50.120 --> 00:01:50.130
host fragment is what's actually going
 

00:01:50.130 --> 00:01:53.870
host fragment is what's actually going
to be that container in your layout so

00:01:53.870 --> 00:01:53.880
to be that container in your layout so
 

00:01:53.880 --> 00:01:55.429
to be that container in your layout so
what do we actually need to build out

00:01:55.429 --> 00:01:55.439
what do we actually need to build out
 

00:01:55.439 --> 00:01:58.310
what do we actually need to build out
this sample app and it's 40 minute talk

00:01:58.310 --> 00:01:58.320
this sample app and it's 40 minute talk
 

00:01:58.320 --> 00:02:01.310
this sample app and it's 40 minute talk
so we're gonna go fast but we have a

00:02:01.310 --> 00:02:01.320
so we're gonna go fast but we have a
 

00:02:01.320 --> 00:02:03.620
so we're gonna go fast but we have a
navigation graph itself so this is kind

00:02:03.620 --> 00:02:03.630
navigation graph itself so this is kind
 

00:02:03.630 --> 00:02:07.760
navigation graph itself so this is kind
of the map of your app and it has four

00:02:07.760 --> 00:02:07.770
of the map of your app and it has four
 

00:02:07.770 --> 00:02:10.180
of the map of your app and it has four
fragment destinations are four screens

00:02:10.180 --> 00:02:10.190
fragment destinations are four screens
 

00:02:10.190 --> 00:02:12.470
fragment destinations are four screens
then of course we're gonna have a menu

00:02:12.470 --> 00:02:12.480
then of course we're gonna have a menu
 

00:02:12.480 --> 00:02:13.360
then of course we're gonna have a menu
and

00:02:13.360 --> 00:02:13.370
and
 

00:02:13.370 --> 00:02:16.119
and
for setting up our side navigation our

00:02:16.119 --> 00:02:16.129
for setting up our side navigation our
 

00:02:16.129 --> 00:02:18.729
for setting up our side navigation our
navigation view with what items we want

00:02:18.729 --> 00:02:18.739
navigation view with what items we want
 

00:02:18.739 --> 00:02:22.119
navigation view with what items we want
in that list but of course we have our

00:02:22.119 --> 00:02:22.129
in that list but of course we have our
 

00:02:22.129 --> 00:02:24.970
in that list but of course we have our
layout for our our activity which is

00:02:24.970 --> 00:02:24.980
layout for our our activity which is
 

00:02:24.980 --> 00:02:26.500
layout for our our activity which is
going to have a drawer layout for our

00:02:26.500 --> 00:02:26.510
going to have a drawer layout for our
 

00:02:26.510 --> 00:02:29.530
going to have a drawer layout for our
side nav a toolbar for our top app bar

00:02:29.530 --> 00:02:29.540
side nav a toolbar for our top app bar
 

00:02:29.540 --> 00:02:31.869
side nav a toolbar for our top app bar
and then our nav shows fragment which is

00:02:31.869 --> 00:02:31.879
and then our nav shows fragment which is
 

00:02:31.879 --> 00:02:34.149
and then our nav shows fragment which is
actually going to be the main content of

00:02:34.149 --> 00:02:34.159
actually going to be the main content of
 

00:02:34.159 --> 00:02:36.580
actually going to be the main content of
our app and then lastly we just need an

00:02:36.580 --> 00:02:36.590
our app and then lastly we just need an
 

00:02:36.590 --> 00:02:38.649
our app and then lastly we just need an
activity to kind of tie all those things

00:02:38.649 --> 00:02:38.659
activity to kind of tie all those things
 

00:02:38.659 --> 00:02:40.750
activity to kind of tie all those things
together so what does this actually look

00:02:40.750 --> 00:02:40.760
together so what does this actually look
 

00:02:40.760 --> 00:02:44.080
together so what does this actually look
like first we'll start with the graph

00:02:44.080 --> 00:02:44.090
like first we'll start with the graph
 

00:02:44.090 --> 00:02:47.470
like first we'll start with the graph
now we want a deep integration in the

00:02:47.470 --> 00:02:47.480
now we want a deep integration in the
 

00:02:47.480 --> 00:02:50.920
now we want a deep integration in the
tooling so in Android studio Android

00:02:50.920 --> 00:02:50.930
tooling so in Android studio Android
 

00:02:50.930 --> 00:02:55.180
tooling so in Android studio Android
studio 3.4 and 3.5 we have a navigation

00:02:55.180 --> 00:02:55.190
studio 3.4 and 3.5 we have a navigation
 

00:02:55.190 --> 00:02:57.369
studio 3.4 and 3.5 we have a navigation
editor so besides being able to do

00:02:57.369 --> 00:02:57.379
editor so besides being able to do
 

00:02:57.379 --> 00:03:00.099
editor so besides being able to do
things in XML and also programmatically

00:03:00.099 --> 00:03:00.109
things in XML and also programmatically
 

00:03:00.109 --> 00:03:02.770
things in XML and also programmatically
if you're up for that you also get a

00:03:02.770 --> 00:03:02.780
if you're up for that you also get a
 

00:03:02.780 --> 00:03:04.899
if you're up for that you also get a
visual editor where we can actually see

00:03:04.899 --> 00:03:04.909
visual editor where we can actually see
 

00:03:04.909 --> 00:03:08.710
visual editor where we can actually see
the structure of our whole app here you

00:03:08.710 --> 00:03:08.720
the structure of our whole app here you
 

00:03:08.720 --> 00:03:10.180
the structure of our whole app here you
know with all the pieces and all the

00:03:10.180 --> 00:03:10.190
know with all the pieces and all the
 

00:03:10.190 --> 00:03:12.580
know with all the pieces and all the
links between each one so for example

00:03:12.580 --> 00:03:12.590
links between each one so for example
 

00:03:12.590 --> 00:03:16.539
links between each one so for example
between the chat list and the chat next

00:03:16.539 --> 00:03:16.549
between the chat list and the chat next
 

00:03:16.549 --> 00:03:18.670
between the chat list and the chat next
for our menu it's all very kind of basic

00:03:18.670 --> 00:03:18.680
for our menu it's all very kind of basic
 

00:03:18.680 --> 00:03:21.370
for our menu it's all very kind of basic
stuff IDs icons and titles for each one

00:03:21.370 --> 00:03:21.380
stuff IDs icons and titles for each one
 

00:03:21.380 --> 00:03:24.909
stuff IDs icons and titles for each one
but the important part here is we'll use

00:03:24.909 --> 00:03:24.919
but the important part here is we'll use
 

00:03:24.919 --> 00:03:29.050
but the important part here is we'll use
the same IDs as we put on in our

00:03:29.050 --> 00:03:29.060
the same IDs as we put on in our
 

00:03:29.060 --> 00:03:31.330
the same IDs as we put on in our
navigation graph and this is what will

00:03:31.330 --> 00:03:31.340
navigation graph and this is what will
 

00:03:31.340 --> 00:03:33.250
navigation graph and this is what will
that navigation kind of tie these things

00:03:33.250 --> 00:03:33.260
that navigation kind of tie these things
 

00:03:33.260 --> 00:03:37.089
that navigation kind of tie these things
together automatically now of course for

00:03:37.089 --> 00:03:37.099
together automatically now of course for
 

00:03:37.099 --> 00:03:39.099
together automatically now of course for
our actual layout we've stripped out a

00:03:39.099 --> 00:03:39.109
our actual layout we've stripped out a
 

00:03:39.109 --> 00:03:42.339
our actual layout we've stripped out a
few layout widths and Heights so don't

00:03:42.339 --> 00:03:42.349
few layout widths and Heights so don't
 

00:03:42.349 --> 00:03:43.960
few layout widths and Heights so don't
try and compile this but that's all the

00:03:43.960 --> 00:03:43.970
try and compile this but that's all the
 

00:03:43.970 --> 00:03:46.300
try and compile this but that's all the
important bits specifically has one

00:03:46.300 --> 00:03:46.310
important bits specifically has one
 

00:03:46.310 --> 00:03:48.220
important bits specifically has one
important bit which is the actual

00:03:48.220 --> 00:03:48.230
important bit which is the actual
 

00:03:48.230 --> 00:03:51.039
important bit which is the actual
Navajos fragment itself so here we'll

00:03:51.039 --> 00:03:51.049
Navajos fragment itself so here we'll
 

00:03:51.049 --> 00:03:53.080
Navajos fragment itself so here we'll
just put it directly in our layout and a

00:03:53.080 --> 00:03:53.090
just put it directly in our layout and a
 

00:03:53.090 --> 00:03:54.909
just put it directly in our layout and a
post fragment and here's where we'll

00:03:54.909 --> 00:03:54.919
post fragment and here's where we'll
 

00:03:54.919 --> 00:03:58.330
post fragment and here's where we'll
actually use that app Navagraha that to

00:03:58.330 --> 00:03:58.340
actually use that app Navagraha that to
 

00:03:58.340 --> 00:04:00.750
actually use that app Navagraha that to
the graph that we created in our xml

00:04:00.750 --> 00:04:00.760
the graph that we created in our xml
 

00:04:00.760 --> 00:04:04.000
the graph that we created in our xml
then took up our navigation view for

00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:04.010
then took up our navigation view for
 

00:04:04.010 --> 00:04:06.280
then took up our navigation view for
that side nav we'll just attach the same

00:04:06.280 --> 00:04:06.290
that side nav we'll just attach the same
 

00:04:06.290 --> 00:04:09.309
that side nav we'll just attach the same
menu that we built here it's now what

00:04:09.309 --> 00:04:09.319
menu that we built here it's now what
 

00:04:09.319 --> 00:04:11.890
menu that we built here it's now what
really is just the activity that binds

00:04:11.890 --> 00:04:11.900
really is just the activity that binds
 

00:04:11.900 --> 00:04:14.740
really is just the activity that binds
all these things together so we made it

00:04:14.740 --> 00:04:14.750
all these things together so we made it
 

00:04:14.750 --> 00:04:16.689
all these things together so we made it
really easy from anywhere in your

00:04:16.689 --> 00:04:16.699
really easy from anywhere in your
 

00:04:16.699 --> 00:04:18.729
really easy from anywhere in your
activity as well as anywhere in a

00:04:18.729 --> 00:04:18.739
activity as well as anywhere in a
 

00:04:18.739 --> 00:04:21.339
activity as well as anywhere in a
fragment as well as any view within that

00:04:21.339 --> 00:04:21.349
fragment as well as any view within that
 

00:04:21.349 --> 00:04:23.950
fragment as well as any view within that
whole hierarchy to get an instance of

00:04:23.950 --> 00:04:23.960
whole hierarchy to get an instance of
 

00:04:23.960 --> 00:04:27.170
whole hierarchy to get an instance of
your nav controller so call an extension

00:04:27.170 --> 00:04:27.180
your nav controller so call an extension
 

00:04:27.180 --> 00:04:29.840
your nav controller so call an extension
or fine nav controller with just the ID

00:04:29.840 --> 00:04:29.850
or fine nav controller with just the ID
 

00:04:29.850 --> 00:04:33.680
or fine nav controller with just the ID
of your naff host fragment of course if

00:04:33.680 --> 00:04:33.690
of your naff host fragment of course if
 

00:04:33.690 --> 00:04:34.610
of your naff host fragment of course if
you're using the java programming

00:04:34.610 --> 00:04:34.620
you're using the java programming
 

00:04:34.620 --> 00:04:35.659
you're using the java programming
language

00:04:35.659 --> 00:04:35.669
language
 

00:04:35.669 --> 00:04:37.490
language
then you'll be able to use a static

00:04:37.490 --> 00:04:37.500
then you'll be able to use a static
 

00:04:37.500 --> 00:04:40.279
then you'll be able to use a static
method to do the exact same thing so

00:04:40.279 --> 00:04:40.289
method to do the exact same thing so
 

00:04:40.289 --> 00:04:42.409
method to do the exact same thing so
once we have this nav controller right

00:04:42.409 --> 00:04:42.419
once we have this nav controller right
 

00:04:42.419 --> 00:04:44.390
once we have this nav controller right
this thing that is powering all of

00:04:44.390 --> 00:04:44.400
this thing that is powering all of
 

00:04:44.400 --> 00:04:46.370
this thing that is powering all of
navigation what do we actually do with

00:04:46.370 --> 00:04:46.380
navigation what do we actually do with
 

00:04:46.380 --> 00:04:49.310
navigation what do we actually do with
it well we can do a couple things one we

00:04:49.310 --> 00:04:49.320
it well we can do a couple things one we
 

00:04:49.320 --> 00:04:51.860
it well we can do a couple things one we
can set up our toolbar at the top and

00:04:51.860 --> 00:04:51.870
can set up our toolbar at the top and
 

00:04:51.870 --> 00:04:55.010
can set up our toolbar at the top and
what we'll do here is use our the app

00:04:55.010 --> 00:04:55.020
what we'll do here is use our the app
 

00:04:55.020 --> 00:04:57.909
what we'll do here is use our the app
bar configuration this is kind of that

00:04:57.909 --> 00:04:57.919
bar configuration this is kind of that
 

00:04:57.919 --> 00:05:00.920
bar configuration this is kind of that
figuring out what that top app bar is

00:05:00.920 --> 00:05:00.930
figuring out what that top app bar is
 

00:05:00.930 --> 00:05:02.540
figuring out what that top app bar is
supposed to do in the first place and

00:05:02.540 --> 00:05:02.550
supposed to do in the first place and
 

00:05:02.550 --> 00:05:04.850
supposed to do in the first place and
the first thing we want to do is make

00:05:04.850 --> 00:05:04.860
the first thing we want to do is make
 

00:05:04.860 --> 00:05:07.070
the first thing we want to do is make
sure that all of those top-level

00:05:07.070 --> 00:05:07.080
sure that all of those top-level
 

00:05:07.080 --> 00:05:09.110
sure that all of those top-level
destinations those three things in our

00:05:09.110 --> 00:05:09.120
destinations those three things in our
 

00:05:09.120 --> 00:05:11.300
destinations those three things in our
navigation view are all kind of at the

00:05:11.300 --> 00:05:11.310
navigation view are all kind of at the
 

00:05:11.310 --> 00:05:13.700
navigation view are all kind of at the
same visual hierarchy so we pass in the

00:05:13.700 --> 00:05:13.710
same visual hierarchy so we pass in the
 

00:05:13.710 --> 00:05:15.680
same visual hierarchy so we pass in the
list here and those are the ones that

00:05:15.680 --> 00:05:15.690
list here and those are the ones that
 

00:05:15.690 --> 00:05:18.350
list here and those are the ones that
won't show an up arrow right there all

00:05:18.350 --> 00:05:18.360
won't show an up arrow right there all
 

00:05:18.360 --> 00:05:21.320
won't show an up arrow right there all
at the same visual hierarchy level so we

00:05:21.320 --> 00:05:21.330
at the same visual hierarchy level so we
 

00:05:21.330 --> 00:05:23.120
at the same visual hierarchy level so we
want to make sure we tell navigation oh

00:05:23.120 --> 00:05:23.130
want to make sure we tell navigation oh
 

00:05:23.130 --> 00:05:25.270
want to make sure we tell navigation oh
these three destinations are important

00:05:25.270 --> 00:05:25.280
these three destinations are important
 

00:05:25.280 --> 00:05:28.189
these three destinations are important
then we're going to pass in the actual

00:05:28.189 --> 00:05:28.199
then we're going to pass in the actual
 

00:05:28.199 --> 00:05:31.250
then we're going to pass in the actual
drawer layout itself and this is the key

00:05:31.250 --> 00:05:31.260
drawer layout itself and this is the key
 

00:05:31.260 --> 00:05:33.140
drawer layout itself and this is the key
that says when you're on one of those

00:05:33.140 --> 00:05:33.150
that says when you're on one of those
 

00:05:33.150 --> 00:05:34.879
that says when you're on one of those
top-level destinations instead of

00:05:34.879 --> 00:05:34.889
top-level destinations instead of
 

00:05:34.889 --> 00:05:37.219
top-level destinations instead of
showing no icon at all you want to show

00:05:37.219 --> 00:05:37.229
showing no icon at all you want to show
 

00:05:37.229 --> 00:05:39.080
showing no icon at all you want to show
that hamburger icon so that users know

00:05:39.080 --> 00:05:39.090
that hamburger icon so that users know
 

00:05:39.090 --> 00:05:41.330
that hamburger icon so that users know
that they can pull out the drawer and

00:05:41.330 --> 00:05:41.340
that they can pull out the drawer and
 

00:05:41.340 --> 00:05:44.360
that they can pull out the drawer and
then with that app bar configuration set

00:05:44.360 --> 00:05:44.370
then with that app bar configuration set
 

00:05:44.370 --> 00:05:46.580
then with that app bar configuration set
up all we call is set up with nav

00:05:46.580 --> 00:05:46.590
up all we call is set up with nav
 

00:05:46.590 --> 00:05:48.770
up all we call is set up with nav
controller another call an extension on

00:05:48.770 --> 00:05:48.780
controller another call an extension on
 

00:05:48.780 --> 00:05:52.100
controller another call an extension on
the toolbar here and now as we navigate

00:05:52.100 --> 00:05:52.110
the toolbar here and now as we navigate
 

00:05:52.110 --> 00:05:55.070
the toolbar here and now as we navigate
between screens of our app we're

00:05:55.070 --> 00:05:55.080
between screens of our app we're
 

00:05:55.080 --> 00:05:57.200
between screens of our app we're
automatically updating the title in the

00:05:57.200 --> 00:05:57.210
automatically updating the title in the
 

00:05:57.210 --> 00:05:59.510
automatically updating the title in the
toolbar we're automatically changing the

00:05:59.510 --> 00:05:59.520
toolbar we're automatically changing the
 

00:05:59.520 --> 00:06:01.730
toolbar we're automatically changing the
icon and there's nothing else we need to

00:06:01.730 --> 00:06:01.740
icon and there's nothing else we need to
 

00:06:01.740 --> 00:06:03.620
icon and there's nothing else we need to
do to hook up to get the correct up

00:06:03.620 --> 00:06:03.630
do to hook up to get the correct up
 

00:06:03.630 --> 00:06:06.620
do to hook up to get the correct up
behavior to get the correct label it's

00:06:06.620 --> 00:06:06.630
behavior to get the correct label it's
 

00:06:06.630 --> 00:06:07.969
behavior to get the correct label it's
all kind of built into this

00:06:07.969 --> 00:06:07.979
all kind of built into this
 

00:06:07.979 --> 00:06:09.800
all kind of built into this
functionality because we've set up our

00:06:09.800 --> 00:06:09.810
functionality because we've set up our
 

00:06:09.810 --> 00:06:12.430
functionality because we've set up our
app bar configuration correctly

00:06:12.430 --> 00:06:12.440
app bar configuration correctly
 

00:06:12.440 --> 00:06:15.830
app bar configuration correctly
similarly for our navigation view it's

00:06:15.830 --> 00:06:15.840
similarly for our navigation view it's
 

00:06:15.840 --> 00:06:17.300
similarly for our navigation view it's
the same type of thing we have with just

00:06:17.300 --> 00:06:17.310
the same type of thing we have with just
 

00:06:17.310 --> 00:06:19.999
the same type of thing we have with just
another set up with nav controller now

00:06:19.999 --> 00:06:20.009
another set up with nav controller now
 

00:06:20.009 --> 00:06:22.730
another set up with nav controller now
whenever you click on something in your

00:06:22.730 --> 00:06:22.740
whenever you click on something in your
 

00:06:22.740 --> 00:06:25.159
whenever you click on something in your
side nav it's automatically gonna go to

00:06:25.159 --> 00:06:25.169
side nav it's automatically gonna go to
 

00:06:25.169 --> 00:06:26.930
side nav it's automatically gonna go to
the right screen because we use that

00:06:26.930 --> 00:06:26.940
the right screen because we use that
 

00:06:26.940 --> 00:06:29.990
the right screen because we use that
same ID in the menu and the navigation

00:06:29.990 --> 00:06:30.000
same ID in the menu and the navigation
 

00:06:30.000 --> 00:06:32.810
same ID in the menu and the navigation
graph similarly the selected item is

00:06:32.810 --> 00:06:32.820
graph similarly the selected item is
 

00:06:32.820 --> 00:06:35.149
graph similarly the selected item is
always going to stay in sync with where

00:06:35.149 --> 00:06:35.159
always going to stay in sync with where
 

00:06:35.159 --> 00:06:38.930
always going to stay in sync with where
you're at in the graph so now we don't

00:06:38.930 --> 00:06:38.940
you're at in the graph so now we don't
 

00:06:38.940 --> 00:06:41.060
you're at in the graph so now we don't
need to focus on anything else

00:06:41.060 --> 00:06:41.070
need to focus on anything else
 

00:06:41.070 --> 00:06:43.940
need to focus on anything else
but we built a lot of things right it

00:06:43.940 --> 00:06:43.950
but we built a lot of things right it
 

00:06:43.950 --> 00:06:45.920
but we built a lot of things right it
was like we just never need to touch our

00:06:45.920 --> 00:06:45.930
was like we just never need to touch our
 

00:06:45.930 --> 00:06:47.120
was like we just never need to touch our
activity again but how do we actually

00:06:47.120 --> 00:06:47.130
activity again but how do we actually
 

00:06:47.130 --> 00:06:49.310
activity again but how do we actually
put this all together well it started

00:06:49.310 --> 00:06:49.320
put this all together well it started
 

00:06:49.320 --> 00:06:51.830
put this all together well it started
with the common library and this is

00:06:51.830 --> 00:06:51.840
with the common library and this is
 

00:06:51.840 --> 00:06:53.750
with the common library and this is
where I actually have the runtime

00:06:53.750 --> 00:06:53.760
where I actually have the runtime
 

00:06:53.760 --> 00:06:56.690
where I actually have the runtime
equivalent of navigation graphs and all

00:06:56.690 --> 00:06:56.700
equivalent of navigation graphs and all
 

00:06:56.700 --> 00:06:59.990
equivalent of navigation graphs and all
the kind of base components and on top

00:06:59.990 --> 00:07:00.000
the kind of base components and on top
 

00:07:00.000 --> 00:07:03.650
the kind of base components and on top
of that is the actual navigation runtime

00:07:03.650 --> 00:07:03.660
of that is the actual navigation runtime
 

00:07:03.660 --> 00:07:05.840
of that is the actual navigation runtime
library so this is kind of that thing

00:07:05.840 --> 00:07:05.850
library so this is kind of that thing
 

00:07:05.850 --> 00:07:07.970
library so this is kind of that thing
that provides the actual nav controller

00:07:07.970 --> 00:07:07.980
that provides the actual nav controller
 

00:07:07.980 --> 00:07:11.630
that provides the actual nav controller
itself but on top of that we realize

00:07:11.630 --> 00:07:11.640
itself but on top of that we realize
 

00:07:11.640 --> 00:07:13.910
itself but on top of that we realize
like okay well that's kind of the core

00:07:13.910 --> 00:07:13.920
like okay well that's kind of the core
 

00:07:13.920 --> 00:07:16.220
like okay well that's kind of the core
pieces but we want to build a few things

00:07:16.220 --> 00:07:16.230
pieces but we want to build a few things
 

00:07:16.230 --> 00:07:18.950
pieces but we want to build a few things
so you know a lot of people do use

00:07:18.950 --> 00:07:18.960
so you know a lot of people do use
 

00:07:18.960 --> 00:07:21.980
so you know a lot of people do use
fragments they are probably one of the

00:07:21.980 --> 00:07:21.990
fragments they are probably one of the
 

00:07:21.990 --> 00:07:26.090
fragments they are probably one of the
most popular api's not from a popularity

00:07:26.090 --> 00:07:26.100
most popular api's not from a popularity
 

00:07:26.100 --> 00:07:29.720
most popular api's not from a popularity
but from a usage perspective so we

00:07:29.720 --> 00:07:29.730
but from a usage perspective so we
 

00:07:29.730 --> 00:07:32.000
but from a usage perspective so we
wanted something out of the box and

00:07:32.000 --> 00:07:32.010
wanted something out of the box and
 

00:07:32.010 --> 00:07:33.530
wanted something out of the box and
especially that integration with other

00:07:33.530 --> 00:07:33.540
especially that integration with other
 

00:07:33.540 --> 00:07:35.120
especially that integration with other
architecture components was really

00:07:35.120 --> 00:07:35.130
architecture components was really
 

00:07:35.130 --> 00:07:37.160
architecture components was really
important so we have the Navajos

00:07:37.160 --> 00:07:37.170
important so we have the Navajos
 

00:07:37.170 --> 00:07:39.410
important so we have the Navajos
fragment and the ability to use fragment

00:07:39.410 --> 00:07:39.420
fragment and the ability to use fragment
 

00:07:39.420 --> 00:07:42.530
fragment and the ability to use fragment
destinations in a navigation fragment

00:07:42.530 --> 00:07:42.540
destinations in a navigation fragment
 

00:07:42.540 --> 00:07:45.410
destinations in a navigation fragment
library similarly if you're using those

00:07:45.410 --> 00:07:45.420
library similarly if you're using those
 

00:07:45.420 --> 00:07:48.260
library similarly if you're using those
material components like toolbars and

00:07:48.260 --> 00:07:48.270
material components like toolbars and
 

00:07:48.270 --> 00:07:51.080
material components like toolbars and
other things then we have a navigation

00:07:51.080 --> 00:07:51.090
other things then we have a navigation
 

00:07:51.090 --> 00:07:53.540
other things then we have a navigation
UI which is what provides the app bar

00:07:53.540 --> 00:07:53.550
UI which is what provides the app bar
 

00:07:53.550 --> 00:07:55.400
UI which is what provides the app bar
configuration and all these set up with

00:07:55.400 --> 00:07:55.410
configuration and all these set up with
 

00:07:55.410 --> 00:07:57.800
configuration and all these set up with
nav controller items these top two items

00:07:57.800 --> 00:07:57.810
nav controller items these top two items
 

00:07:57.810 --> 00:08:00.860
nav controller items these top two items
are totally optional if you want to go

00:08:00.860 --> 00:08:00.870
are totally optional if you want to go
 

00:08:00.870 --> 00:08:02.690
are totally optional if you want to go
off the rails and do something totally

00:08:02.690 --> 00:08:02.700
off the rails and do something totally
 

00:08:02.700 --> 00:08:05.360
off the rails and do something totally
different we do support all of that as

00:08:05.360 --> 00:08:05.370
different we do support all of that as
 

00:08:05.370 --> 00:08:08.480
different we do support all of that as
well just using navigation runtime and

00:08:08.480 --> 00:08:08.490
well just using navigation runtime and
 

00:08:08.490 --> 00:08:11.750
well just using navigation runtime and
of course because it's 2019 of course we

00:08:11.750 --> 00:08:11.760
of course because it's 2019 of course we
 

00:08:11.760 --> 00:08:14.990
of course because it's 2019 of course we
have KTX versions of all of these so

00:08:14.990 --> 00:08:15.000
have KTX versions of all of these so
 

00:08:15.000 --> 00:08:17.030
have KTX versions of all of these so
Colin extensions for all of these things

00:08:17.030 --> 00:08:17.040
Colin extensions for all of these things
 

00:08:17.040 --> 00:08:19.550
Colin extensions for all of these things
as well as a Colin DSL for building

00:08:19.550 --> 00:08:19.560
as well as a Colin DSL for building
 

00:08:19.560 --> 00:08:21.230
as well as a Colin DSL for building
navigation graphs and many other

00:08:21.230 --> 00:08:21.240
navigation graphs and many other
 

00:08:21.240 --> 00:08:25.250
navigation graphs and many other
features if you're using Colin now we

00:08:25.250 --> 00:08:25.260
features if you're using Colin now we
 

00:08:25.260 --> 00:08:27.830
features if you're using Colin now we
talked a little bit about the library

00:08:27.830 --> 00:08:27.840
talked a little bit about the library
 

00:08:27.840 --> 00:08:30.260
talked a little bit about the library
side and saw the navigation editor but

00:08:30.260 --> 00:08:30.270
side and saw the navigation editor but
 

00:08:30.270 --> 00:08:32.120
side and saw the navigation editor but
we also have more tooling integration as

00:08:32.120 --> 00:08:32.130
we also have more tooling integration as
 

00:08:32.130 --> 00:08:34.850
we also have more tooling integration as
well so being able to integrate in with

00:08:34.850 --> 00:08:34.860
well so being able to integrate in with
 

00:08:34.860 --> 00:08:37.159
well so being able to integrate in with
manifest merger so you don't have to

00:08:37.159 --> 00:08:37.169
manifest merger so you don't have to
 

00:08:37.169 --> 00:08:40.040
manifest merger so you don't have to
write intent filters for deep links we

00:08:40.040 --> 00:08:40.050
write intent filters for deep links we
 

00:08:40.050 --> 00:08:41.420
write intent filters for deep links we
can build that for you

00:08:41.420 --> 00:08:41.430
can build that for you
 

00:08:41.430 --> 00:08:43.280
can build that for you
out of the deep links you put in your

00:08:43.280 --> 00:08:43.290
out of the deep links you put in your
 

00:08:43.290 --> 00:08:46.130
out of the deep links you put in your
navigation graph similarly we also have

00:08:46.130 --> 00:08:46.140
navigation graph similarly we also have
 

00:08:46.140 --> 00:08:48.380
navigation graph similarly we also have
a safe args Gradle plugin which we'll

00:08:48.380 --> 00:08:48.390
a safe args Gradle plugin which we'll
 

00:08:48.390 --> 00:08:50.840
a safe args Gradle plugin which we'll
talk about more in detail that really

00:08:50.840 --> 00:08:50.850
talk about more in detail that really
 

00:08:50.850 --> 00:08:52.160
talk about more in detail that really
makes it easy to move between

00:08:52.160 --> 00:08:52.170
makes it easy to move between
 

00:08:52.170 --> 00:08:55.069
makes it easy to move between
destinations and it types

00:08:55.069 --> 00:08:55.079
destinations and it types
 

00:08:55.079 --> 00:08:57.359
destinations and it types
and of course we also talked about the

00:08:57.359 --> 00:08:57.369
and of course we also talked about the
 

00:08:57.369 --> 00:08:59.429
and of course we also talked about the
guidance side of things so one of the

00:08:59.429 --> 00:08:59.439
guidance side of things so one of the
 

00:08:59.439 --> 00:09:01.319
guidance side of things so one of the
things that was really for us is to not

00:09:01.319 --> 00:09:01.329
things that was really for us is to not
 

00:09:01.329 --> 00:09:04.379
things that was really for us is to not
just throw a library over the wall but

00:09:04.379 --> 00:09:04.389
just throw a library over the wall but
 

00:09:04.389 --> 00:09:06.960
just throw a library over the wall but
instead really talk to our internal

00:09:06.960 --> 00:09:06.970
instead really talk to our internal
 

00:09:06.970 --> 00:09:09.660
instead really talk to our internal

Google say what actually works for

00:09:12.030 --> 00:09:12.040
Google say what actually works for
 

00:09:12.040 --> 00:09:14.249
Google say what actually works for
developers how can we make a consistent

00:09:14.249 --> 00:09:14.259
developers how can we make a consistent
 

00:09:14.259 --> 00:09:16.769
developers how can we make a consistent
experience across everyone and that

00:09:16.769 --> 00:09:16.779
experience across everyone and that
 

00:09:16.779 --> 00:09:18.239
experience across everyone and that
really came up with a lot of the

00:09:18.239 --> 00:09:18.249
really came up with a lot of the
 

00:09:18.249 --> 00:09:20.699
really came up with a lot of the
guidance and a lot of the documentation

00:09:20.699 --> 00:09:20.709
guidance and a lot of the documentation
 

00:09:20.709 --> 00:09:22.530
guidance and a lot of the documentation
that we provide so we have quite a few

00:09:22.530 --> 00:09:22.540
that we provide so we have quite a few
 

00:09:22.540 --> 00:09:26.129
that we provide so we have quite a few
pages on developer.android.com that

00:09:26.129 --> 00:09:26.139
pages on developer.android.com that
 

00:09:26.139 --> 00:09:28.829
pages on developer.android.com that
really go into the details on how not

00:09:28.829 --> 00:09:28.839
really go into the details on how not
 

00:09:28.839 --> 00:09:31.679
really go into the details on how not
only how to use navigation but also some

00:09:31.679 --> 00:09:31.689
only how to use navigation but also some
 

00:09:31.689 --> 00:09:33.329
only how to use navigation but also some
of the why and some of the reasonings

00:09:33.329 --> 00:09:33.339
of the why and some of the reasonings
 

00:09:33.339 --> 00:09:36.269
of the why and some of the reasonings
behind things and the way to really kind

00:09:36.269 --> 00:09:36.279
behind things and the way to really kind
 

00:09:36.279 --> 00:09:38.489
behind things and the way to really kind
of set it up in a consistent way across

00:09:38.489 --> 00:09:38.499
of set it up in a consistent way across
 

00:09:38.499 --> 00:09:41.579
of set it up in a consistent way across
every app and also we have worked with

00:09:41.579 --> 00:09:41.589
every app and also we have worked with
 

00:09:41.589 --> 00:09:44.429
every app and also we have worked with
dev rel and other organizations to make

00:09:44.429 --> 00:09:44.439
dev rel and other organizations to make
 

00:09:44.439 --> 00:09:46.409
dev rel and other organizations to make
sure that you have good getting started

00:09:46.409 --> 00:09:46.419
sure that you have good getting started
 

00:09:46.419 --> 00:09:49.379
sure that you have good getting started
points with our code lab now the

00:09:49.379 --> 00:09:49.389
points with our code lab now the
 

00:09:49.389 --> 00:09:51.449
points with our code lab now the
documentation was a really big focus for

00:09:51.449 --> 00:09:51.459
documentation was a really big focus for
 

00:09:51.459 --> 00:09:53.549
documentation was a really big focus for
the navigation stable released last

00:09:53.549 --> 00:09:53.559
the navigation stable released last
 

00:09:53.559 --> 00:09:58.559
the navigation stable released last
month but it also is a big focus for our

00:09:58.559 --> 00:09:58.569
month but it also is a big focus for our
 

00:09:58.569 --> 00:10:01.319
month but it also is a big focus for our
navigation 2.1 release which is in alpha

00:10:01.319 --> 00:10:01.329
navigation 2.1 release which is in alpha
 

00:10:01.329 --> 00:10:03.989
navigation 2.1 release which is in alpha
right now one of the things in there was

00:10:03.989 --> 00:10:03.999
right now one of the things in there was
 

00:10:03.999 --> 00:10:07.229
right now one of the things in there was
dialog destinations so in addition to

00:10:07.229 --> 00:10:07.239
dialog destinations so in addition to
 

00:10:07.239 --> 00:10:09.479
dialog destinations so in addition to
using full screen fragments now you can

00:10:09.479 --> 00:10:09.489
using full screen fragments now you can
 

00:10:09.489 --> 00:10:13.409
using full screen fragments now you can
use a dialog destination and in then you

00:10:13.409 --> 00:10:13.419
use a dialog destination and in then you
 

00:10:13.419 --> 00:10:16.799
use a dialog destination and in then you
can navigate to a dialog so this is

00:10:16.799 --> 00:10:16.809
can navigate to a dialog so this is
 

00:10:16.809 --> 00:10:19.259
can navigate to a dialog so this is
supported out of the box by nav host

00:10:19.259 --> 00:10:19.269
supported out of the box by nav host
 

00:10:19.269 --> 00:10:21.359
supported out of the box by nav host
fragment just like fragment destinations

00:10:21.359 --> 00:10:21.369
fragment just like fragment destinations
 

00:10:21.369 --> 00:10:23.699
fragment just like fragment destinations
that allows you to use all the same

00:10:23.699 --> 00:10:23.709
that allows you to use all the same
 

00:10:23.709 --> 00:10:26.220
that allows you to use all the same
actions and arguments as you would for

00:10:26.220 --> 00:10:26.230
actions and arguments as you would for
 

00:10:26.230 --> 00:10:28.769
actions and arguments as you would for
any other kind of destination so what

00:10:28.769 --> 00:10:28.779
any other kind of destination so what
 

00:10:28.779 --> 00:10:30.840
any other kind of destination so what
does this look like in code well instead

00:10:30.840 --> 00:10:30.850
does this look like in code well instead
 

00:10:30.850 --> 00:10:33.030
does this look like in code well instead
of just using the fragment tag for a

00:10:33.030 --> 00:10:33.040
of just using the fragment tag for a
 

00:10:33.040 --> 00:10:36.720
of just using the fragment tag for a
fragment now we can use a dialogue tag

00:10:36.720 --> 00:10:36.730
fragment now we can use a dialogue tag
 

00:10:36.730 --> 00:10:38.850
fragment now we can use a dialogue tag
for a dialogue oh that's pretty easy

00:10:38.850 --> 00:10:38.860
for a dialogue oh that's pretty easy
 

00:10:38.860 --> 00:10:41.400
for a dialogue oh that's pretty easy
right same type of things are supported

00:10:41.400 --> 00:10:41.410
right same type of things are supported
 

00:10:41.410 --> 00:10:42.989
right same type of things are supported
so if you have arguments like for

00:10:42.989 --> 00:10:42.999
so if you have arguments like for
 

00:10:42.999 --> 00:10:44.479
so if you have arguments like for
example here we have an error message

00:10:44.479 --> 00:10:44.489
example here we have an error message
 

00:10:44.489 --> 00:10:48.720
example here we have an error message
for our error dialog fragment those all

00:10:48.720 --> 00:10:48.730
for our error dialog fragment those all
 

00:10:48.730 --> 00:10:50.369
for our error dialog fragment those all
still work just like any other

00:10:50.369 --> 00:10:50.379
still work just like any other
 

00:10:50.379 --> 00:10:52.660
still work just like any other
destination

00:10:52.660 --> 00:10:52.670
destination
 

00:10:52.670 --> 00:10:54.519
destination
another feature that we were really

00:10:54.519 --> 00:10:54.529
another feature that we were really
 

00:10:54.529 --> 00:10:57.009
another feature that we were really
excited about for navigation 2.1 was

00:10:57.009 --> 00:10:57.019
excited about for navigation 2.1 was
 

00:10:57.019 --> 00:10:59.500
excited about for navigation 2.1 was
integration with view models now view

00:10:59.500 --> 00:10:59.510
integration with view models now view
 

00:10:59.510 --> 00:11:01.329
integration with view models now view
models are an architecture component

00:11:01.329 --> 00:11:01.339
models are an architecture component
 

00:11:01.339 --> 00:11:03.790
models are an architecture component
about saving data across configuration

00:11:03.790 --> 00:11:03.800
about saving data across configuration
 

00:11:03.800 --> 00:11:06.610
about saving data across configuration
changes and with the new safe state view

00:11:06.610 --> 00:11:06.620
changes and with the new safe state view
 

00:11:06.620 --> 00:11:09.220
changes and with the new safe state view
models even saving things across process

00:11:09.220 --> 00:11:09.230
models even saving things across process
 

00:11:09.230 --> 00:11:11.980
models even saving things across process
death and Recreation but we realized

00:11:11.980 --> 00:11:11.990
death and Recreation but we realized
 

00:11:11.990 --> 00:11:13.810
death and Recreation but we realized
there was something that needed to

00:11:13.810 --> 00:11:13.820
there was something that needed to
 

00:11:13.820 --> 00:11:17.170
there was something that needed to
happen in between the activity scope ie

00:11:17.170 --> 00:11:17.180
happen in between the activity scope ie
 

00:11:17.180 --> 00:11:20.350
happen in between the activity scope ie
the entire app as well as just the

00:11:20.350 --> 00:11:20.360
the entire app as well as just the
 

00:11:20.360 --> 00:11:23.139
the entire app as well as just the
individual fragment level so now you can

00:11:23.139 --> 00:11:23.149
individual fragment level so now you can
 

00:11:23.149 --> 00:11:25.540
individual fragment level so now you can
actually scope things to a navigation

00:11:25.540 --> 00:11:25.550
actually scope things to a navigation
 

00:11:25.550 --> 00:11:27.699
actually scope things to a navigation
graph so let's take a look at what that

00:11:27.699 --> 00:11:27.709
graph so let's take a look at what that
 

00:11:27.709 --> 00:11:30.009
graph so let's take a look at what that
looks like here's our four destinations

00:11:30.009 --> 00:11:30.019
looks like here's our four destinations
 

00:11:30.019 --> 00:11:32.050
looks like here's our four destinations
that we add and now we want to add an

00:11:32.050 --> 00:11:32.060
that we add and now we want to add an
 

00:11:32.060 --> 00:11:34.329
that we add and now we want to add an
onboarding flow right and so our our

00:11:34.329 --> 00:11:34.339
onboarding flow right and so our our
 

00:11:34.339 --> 00:11:37.269
onboarding flow right and so our our
onboarding Florez welcome set up and

00:11:37.269 --> 00:11:37.279

the way of attaching information at the
 

00:11:59.750 --> 00:12:01.900
the way of attaching information at the
graph level rather than just at the

graph level rather than just at the
 

00:12:01.910 --> 00:12:04.870
graph level rather than just at the
destination level so what does this look

00:12:04.870 --> 00:12:04.880
destination level so what does this look
 

00:12:04.880 --> 00:12:10.030

functions for the ballot actions that

00:15:48.310 --> 00:15:48.320
functions for the ballot actions that
 

00:15:48.320 --> 00:15:51.160
functions for the ballot actions that
you can take these functions also

00:15:51.160 --> 00:15:51.170
you can take these functions also
 

00:15:51.170 --> 00:15:54.340
you can take these functions also
actually have parameters and these

00:15:54.340 --> 00:15:54.350
actually have parameters and these
 

00:15:54.350 --> 00:15:57.820
actually have parameters and these
parameters are based on the arguments

00:15:57.820 --> 00:15:57.830
parameters are based on the arguments
 

00:15:57.830 --> 00:15:59.380
parameters are based on the arguments
that you have in your action and if they

00:15:59.380 --> 00:15:59.390
that you have in your action and if they
 

00:15:59.390 --> 00:16:01.510
that you have in your action and if they
have default values they all show here

00:16:01.510 --> 00:16:01.520
have default values they all show here
 

00:16:01.520 --> 00:16:04.210
have default values they all show here
as default value as you can see and this

00:16:04.210 --> 00:16:04.220
as default value as you can see and this
 

00:16:04.220 --> 00:16:06.880
as default value as you can see and this
is how we make sure that by calling this

00:16:06.880 --> 00:16:06.890
is how we make sure that by calling this
 

00:16:06.890 --> 00:16:08.230
is how we make sure that by calling this
function and passing the right

00:16:08.230 --> 00:16:08.240
function and passing the right
 

00:16:08.240 --> 00:16:10.270
function and passing the right
parameters you will be able to receive

00:16:10.270 --> 00:16:10.280
parameters you will be able to receive
 

00:16:10.280 --> 00:16:14.290
parameters you will be able to receive
them on the other side correctly safer

also generates a second set of classes
 

00:16:16.610 --> 00:16:20.110
also generates a second set of classes
which we call the arts classes we

00:16:20.110 --> 00:16:20.120
which we call the arts classes we
 

00:16:20.120 --> 00:16:22.450

teeth these two methods to bundle from

00:16:36.730 --> 00:16:36.740
teeth these two methods to bundle from
 

00:16:36.740 --> 00:16:39.900
teeth these two methods to bundle from
Mongo and you will use these methods to

00:16:39.900 --> 00:16:39.910
Mongo and you will use these methods to
 

00:16:39.910 --> 00:16:44.560

actually you know get the arts out but

00:16:44.560 --> 00:16:44.570
actually you know get the arts out but
 

00:16:44.570 --> 00:16:46.720
actually you know get the arts out but
using this method is how we basically

00:16:46.720 --> 00:16:46.730
using this method is how we basically
 

00:16:46.730 --> 00:16:49.030
using this method is how we basically
take what their responsibility from you

00:16:49.030 --> 00:16:49.040
take what their responsibility from you
 

00:16:49.040 --> 00:16:52.030
take what their responsibility from you
from using bundles even better if you're

00:16:52.030 --> 00:16:52.040
from using bundles even better if you're
 

00:16:52.040 --> 00:16:53.710

noticed that the generator code is in
 

00:17:07.130 --> 00:17:09.190
noticed that the generator code is in
Kotlin and that's because safe arts will

00:17:09.190 --> 00:17:09.200
Kotlin and that's because safe arts will
 

00:17:09.200 --> 00:17:10.780

if you have a coupling only app then
 

00:17:44.900 --> 00:17:46.600
if you have a coupling only app then
generate the cutting code that means you

00:17:46.600 --> 00:17:46.610
generate the cutting code that means you
 

00:17:46.610 --> 00:17:48.880
generate the cutting code that means you
don't have big sources and the second is

the Kotlin inversion we have data

00:17:58.660 --> 00:17:58.670
the Kotlin inversion we have data
 

00:17:58.670 --> 00:18:00.460
the Kotlin inversion we have data
classes with primary constructor that

00:18:00.460 --> 00:18:00.470
classes with primary constructor that
 

00:18:00.470 --> 00:18:02.230
classes with primary constructor that
you can use name arguments and default

00:18:02.230 --> 00:18:02.240
you can use name arguments and default
 

00:18:02.240 --> 00:18:04.480
you can use name arguments and default
arguments so that's pretty nice because

00:18:04.480 --> 00:18:04.490
arguments so that's pretty nice because
 

00:18:04.490 --> 00:18:05.830
arguments so that's pretty nice because
their data classes you also have things

00:18:05.830 --> 00:18:05.840
their data classes you also have things
 

00:18:05.840 --> 00:18:07.660
their data classes you also have things
like copy hash code and those kind of

00:18:07.660 --> 00:18:07.670
like copy hash code and those kind of
 

00:18:07.670 --> 00:18:12.520
like copy hash code and those kind of
things for your arguments now whether

00:18:12.520 --> 00:18:12.530

support a lot of types so we started

00:18:21.820 --> 00:18:21.830
support a lot of types so we started
 

00:18:21.830 --> 00:18:23.590
support a lot of types so we started
supporting the pragmatic side and as we

00:18:23.590 --> 00:18:23.600
supporting the pragmatic side and as we
 

00:18:23.600 --> 00:18:25.960
supporting the pragmatic side and as we
got closer through stable we were we

00:18:25.960 --> 00:18:25.970
got closer through stable we were we
 

00:18:25.970 --> 00:18:28.390

00:19:35.940 --> 00:19:37.009
application to your users a couple of
the benefits there on modularization

00:19:37.009 --> 00:19:37.019
the benefits there on modularization
 

00:19:37.019 --> 00:19:39.710
the benefits there on modularization
during development are that you can cut

00:19:39.710 --> 00:19:39.720
during development are that you can cut
 

00:19:39.720 --> 00:19:41.089
during development are that you can cut
down your build times by creating

00:19:41.089 --> 00:19:41.099
down your build times by creating
 

00:19:41.099 --> 00:19:43.039
down your build times by creating
distinct modules also you can separate

00:19:43.039 --> 00:19:43.049
distinct modules also you can separate
 

00:19:43.049 --> 00:19:44.659
distinct modules also you can separate
the concerns within the image and within

00:19:44.659 --> 00:19:44.669
the concerns within the image and within
 

00:19:44.669 --> 00:19:47.810
the concerns within the image and within
those separation of concerns also is

00:19:47.810 --> 00:19:47.820
those separation of concerns also is
 

00:19:47.820 --> 00:19:50.839
those separation of concerns also is
around navigation and navigation library

00:19:50.839 --> 00:19:50.849
around navigation and navigation library
 

00:19:50.849 --> 00:19:55.430
around navigation and navigation library
supports modularization so let's talk a

00:19:55.430 --> 00:19:55.440
supports modularization so let's talk a
 

00:19:55.440 --> 00:19:57.109
supports modularization so let's talk a
little bit about how you can split up

00:19:57.109 --> 00:19:57.119
little bit about how you can split up
 

00:19:57.119 --> 00:19:58.609
little bit about how you can split up
your graph while you break up your

00:19:58.609 --> 00:19:58.619
your graph while you break up your
 

00:19:58.619 --> 00:20:04.609
your graph while you break up your
application into distinct modules we saw

00:20:04.609 --> 00:20:04.619
application into distinct modules we saw
 

00:20:04.619 --> 00:20:06.229
application into distinct modules we saw
this graph grow over this presentation

00:20:06.229 --> 00:20:06.239
this graph grow over this presentation
 

00:20:06.239 --> 00:20:09.979
this graph grow over this presentation
and we have a couple of you look at the

00:20:09.979 --> 00:20:09.989
and we have a couple of you look at the
 

00:20:09.989 --> 00:20:12.469
and we have a couple of you look at the
design editor here we have a home and

00:20:12.469 --> 00:20:12.479
design editor here we have a home and
 

00:20:12.479 --> 00:20:14.690
design editor here we have a home and
error our home graph which is the which

00:20:14.690 --> 00:20:14.700
error our home graph which is the which
 

00:20:14.700 --> 00:20:16.249
error our home graph which is the which
also has the arrow dialogue we have a

00:20:16.249 --> 00:20:16.259
also has the arrow dialogue we have a
 

00:20:16.259 --> 00:20:18.979
also has the arrow dialogue we have a
chat list we have the chat and we have

00:20:18.979 --> 00:20:18.989
chat list we have the chat and we have
 

00:20:18.989 --> 00:20:20.749
chat list we have the chat and we have
the profile as well also we have a

00:20:20.749 --> 00:20:20.759
the profile as well also we have a
 

00:20:20.759 --> 00:20:22.940
the profile as well also we have a
nested graph in here we can break this

00:20:22.940 --> 00:20:22.950
nested graph in here we can break this
 

00:20:22.950 --> 00:20:25.430
nested graph in here we can break this
up in multiple in multiple ways what we

00:20:25.430 --> 00:20:25.440
up in multiple in multiple ways what we
 

00:20:25.440 --> 00:20:27.619
up in multiple in multiple ways what we
are doing here is we're breaking up this

00:20:27.619 --> 00:20:27.629
are doing here is we're breaking up this
 

00:20:27.629 --> 00:20:31.279
are doing here is we're breaking up this
graph into several distinct libraries we

00:20:31.279 --> 00:20:31.289
graph into several distinct libraries we
 

00:20:31.289 --> 00:20:33.080
graph into several distinct libraries we
will still continue to have one

00:20:33.080 --> 00:20:33.090
will still continue to have one
 

00:20:33.090 --> 00:20:35.060
will still continue to have one
application module we will have a home

00:20:35.060 --> 00:20:35.070
application module we will have a home
 

00:20:35.070 --> 00:20:37.639
application module we will have a home
module a chat and a profile we'll just

00:20:37.639 --> 00:20:37.649
module a chat and a profile we'll just
 

00:20:37.649 --> 00:20:39.139
module a chat and a profile we'll just
take that away and put it into a

00:20:39.139 --> 00:20:39.149
take that away and put it into a
 

00:20:39.149 --> 00:20:41.659
take that away and put it into a
distinct graph in a distinct library

00:20:41.659 --> 00:20:41.669
distinct graph in a distinct library
 

00:20:41.669 --> 00:20:47.539
distinct graph in a distinct library
module as well so if you take a look at

00:20:47.539 --> 00:20:47.549
module as well so if you take a look at
 

00:20:47.549 --> 00:20:49.820
module as well so if you take a look at
this for these navigation file it's

00:20:49.820 --> 00:20:49.830
this for these navigation file it's
 

00:20:49.830 --> 00:20:51.320
this for these navigation file it's
really really tricky to see what's going

00:20:51.320 --> 00:20:51.330
really really tricky to see what's going
 

00:20:51.330 --> 00:20:54.259
really really tricky to see what's going
on here and this is already a very

00:20:54.259 --> 00:20:54.269
on here and this is already a very
 

00:20:54.269 --> 00:20:56.869
on here and this is already a very
simplified example if you have a real

00:20:56.869 --> 00:20:56.879
simplified example if you have a real
 

00:20:56.879 --> 00:20:58.430
simplified example if you have a real
world app you can keep on scrolling with

00:20:58.430 --> 00:20:58.440
world app you can keep on scrolling with
 

00:20:58.440 --> 00:21:02.180
world app you can keep on scrolling with
these for a long time so what we do

00:21:02.180 --> 00:21:02.190
these for a long time so what we do
 

00:21:02.190 --> 00:21:04.729
these for a long time so what we do
instead is we just break it up into the

00:21:04.729 --> 00:21:04.739
instead is we just break it up into the
 

00:21:04.739 --> 00:21:07.399
instead is we just break it up into the
modules we take out the relevant source

00:21:07.399 --> 00:21:07.409
modules we take out the relevant source
 

00:21:07.409 --> 00:21:09.859
modules we take out the relevant source
or the relevant destinations and put

00:21:09.859 --> 00:21:09.869
or the relevant destinations and put
 

00:21:09.869 --> 00:21:12.499
or the relevant destinations and put
those into the files where they are

00:21:12.499 --> 00:21:12.509
those into the files where they are
 

00:21:12.509 --> 00:21:15.979
those into the files where they are
going to be used and we do that for each

00:21:15.979 --> 00:21:15.989
going to be used and we do that for each
 

00:21:15.989 --> 00:21:17.899
going to be used and we do that for each
of the modules that we recruit that we

00:21:17.899 --> 00:21:17.909
of the modules that we recruit that we
 

00:21:17.909 --> 00:21:19.200
of the modules that we recruit that we
are creating as

00:21:19.200 --> 00:21:19.210
are creating as
 

00:21:19.210 --> 00:21:21.480
are creating as
see each of that has a start destination

00:21:21.480 --> 00:21:21.490
see each of that has a start destination
 

00:21:21.490 --> 00:21:28.860
see each of that has a start destination
that we're able to jump into and then we

00:21:28.860 --> 00:21:28.870
that we're able to jump into and then we
 

00:21:28.870 --> 00:21:32.730
that we're able to jump into and then we
include these in the graph that we are

00:21:32.730 --> 00:21:32.740
include these in the graph that we are
 

00:21:32.740 --> 00:21:35.490
include these in the graph that we are
hosting in the application itself so all

00:21:35.490 --> 00:21:35.500
hosting in the application itself so all
 

00:21:35.500 --> 00:21:37.740
hosting in the application itself so all
the modules that we have created can be

00:21:37.740 --> 00:21:37.750
the modules that we have created can be
 

00:21:37.750 --> 00:21:41.039
the modules that we have created can be
included in that the way this works is

00:21:41.039 --> 00:21:41.049
included in that the way this works is
 

00:21:41.049 --> 00:21:43.080
included in that the way this works is
using the include tag that has been

00:21:43.080 --> 00:21:43.090
using the include tag that has been
 

00:21:43.090 --> 00:21:45.680
using the include tag that has been
around since we launched navigation and

00:21:45.680 --> 00:21:45.690
around since we launched navigation and
 

00:21:45.690 --> 00:21:48.269
around since we launched navigation and
you just simply include the graphs that

00:21:48.269 --> 00:21:48.279
you just simply include the graphs that
 

00:21:48.279 --> 00:21:50.730
you just simply include the graphs that
you we have it extracted out here this

00:21:50.730 --> 00:21:50.740
you we have it extracted out here this
 

00:21:50.740 --> 00:21:52.680
you we have it extracted out here this
goes alongside each other in navigation

00:21:52.680 --> 00:21:52.690
goes alongside each other in navigation
 

00:21:52.690 --> 00:21:54.360
goes alongside each other in navigation
destination that already exists so you

00:21:54.360 --> 00:21:54.370
destination that already exists so you
 

00:21:54.370 --> 00:21:56.220
destination that already exists so you
can have nested graphs or any other

00:21:56.220 --> 00:21:56.230
can have nested graphs or any other
 

00:21:56.230 --> 00:21:59.029
can have nested graphs or any other
target any other destination in here

00:21:59.029 --> 00:21:59.039
target any other destination in here
 

00:21:59.039 --> 00:22:02.399
target any other destination in here
this is really cool when you have when

00:22:02.399 --> 00:22:02.409
this is really cool when you have when
 

00:22:02.409 --> 00:22:03.720
this is really cool when you have when
you have independent graphs and you want

00:22:03.720 --> 00:22:03.730
you have independent graphs and you want
 

00:22:03.730 --> 00:22:05.779
you have independent graphs and you want
to navigate between those that's great

00:22:05.779 --> 00:22:05.789
to navigate between those that's great
 

00:22:05.789 --> 00:22:08.880
to navigate between those that's great
but what if you want to move from one

00:22:08.880 --> 00:22:08.890
but what if you want to move from one
 

00:22:08.890 --> 00:22:12.450
but what if you want to move from one
graph to another our chat app has grown

00:22:12.450 --> 00:22:12.460
graph to another our chat app has grown
 

00:22:12.460 --> 00:22:15.360
graph to another our chat app has grown
so we have a profile fragment but also

00:22:15.360 --> 00:22:15.370
so we have a profile fragment but also
 

00:22:15.370 --> 00:22:17.490
so we have a profile fragment but also
well we want to have friends in the app

00:22:17.490 --> 00:22:17.500
well we want to have friends in the app
 

00:22:17.500 --> 00:22:19.139
well we want to have friends in the app
so we want to make sure that we have the

00:22:19.139 --> 00:22:19.149
so we want to make sure that we have the
 

00:22:19.149 --> 00:22:21.269
so we want to make sure that we have the
friend list there as well and since you

00:22:21.269 --> 00:22:21.279
friend list there as well and since you
 

00:22:21.279 --> 00:22:23.370
friend list there as well and since you
can navigate from the profile to the

00:22:23.370 --> 00:22:23.380
can navigate from the profile to the
 

00:22:23.380 --> 00:22:26.159
can navigate from the profile to the
friend list we have that in the profile

00:22:26.159 --> 00:22:26.169
friend list we have that in the profile
 

00:22:26.169 --> 00:22:29.310
friend list we have that in the profile
graph so what you want to do is what you

00:22:29.310 --> 00:22:29.320
graph so what you want to do is what you
 

00:22:29.320 --> 00:22:31.980
graph so what you want to do is what you
can do here with IDs is you can simply

00:22:31.980 --> 00:22:31.990
can do here with IDs is you can simply
 

00:22:31.990 --> 00:22:34.919
can do here with IDs is you can simply
reference the chat graph and the start

00:22:34.919 --> 00:22:34.929
reference the chat graph and the start
 

00:22:34.929 --> 00:22:37.019
reference the chat graph and the start
destination here but I will only lead us

00:22:37.019 --> 00:22:37.029
destination here but I will only lead us
 

00:22:37.029 --> 00:22:39.389
destination here but I will only lead us
so far actually what we would like to

00:22:39.389 --> 00:22:39.399
so far actually what we would like to
 

00:22:39.399 --> 00:22:41.909
so far actually what we would like to
have is we want to go straight if

00:22:41.909 --> 00:22:41.919
have is we want to go straight if
 

00:22:41.919 --> 00:22:44.279
have is we want to go straight if
somebody if we click on the on a friend

00:22:44.279 --> 00:22:44.289
somebody if we click on the on a friend
 

00:22:44.289 --> 00:22:45.630
somebody if we click on the on a friend
list what we want to do is we want to go

00:22:45.630 --> 00:22:45.640
list what we want to do is we want to go
 

00:22:45.640 --> 00:22:48.149
list what we want to do is we want to go
straight to the chat fragment being able

00:22:48.149 --> 00:22:48.159
straight to the chat fragment being able
 

00:22:48.159 --> 00:22:49.980
straight to the chat fragment being able
to chat directly with a friend rather

00:22:49.980 --> 00:22:49.990
to chat directly with a friend rather
 

00:22:49.990 --> 00:22:51.690
to chat directly with a friend rather
than going to the chat list first and

00:22:51.690 --> 00:22:51.700
than going to the chat list first and
 

00:22:51.700 --> 00:22:54.960
than going to the chat list first and
I'm jumping in there with IDs like I

00:22:54.960 --> 00:22:54.970
I'm jumping in there with IDs like I
 

00:22:54.970 --> 00:22:56.430
I'm jumping in there with IDs like I
said it's not only possible to jump

00:22:56.430 --> 00:22:56.440
said it's not only possible to jump
 

00:22:56.440 --> 00:22:58.500
said it's not only possible to jump
directly to the start destination of the

00:22:58.500 --> 00:22:58.510
directly to the start destination of the
 

00:22:58.510 --> 00:23:02.220
directly to the start destination of the
graph and that's why with navigation 2.1

00:23:02.220 --> 00:23:02.230
graph and that's why with navigation 2.1
 

00:23:02.230 --> 00:23:05.299
graph and that's why with navigation 2.1
we have enabled navigation by your eyes

00:23:05.299 --> 00:23:05.309
we have enabled navigation by your eyes
 

00:23:05.309 --> 00:23:07.740
we have enabled navigation by your eyes
so you can use deep links to navigate

00:23:07.740 --> 00:23:07.750
so you can use deep links to navigate
 

00:23:07.750 --> 00:23:10.380
so you can use deep links to navigate
directly to destinations even across

00:23:10.380 --> 00:23:10.390
directly to destinations even across
 

00:23:10.390 --> 00:23:17.010
directly to destinations even across
graph boundaries how this works is you

00:23:17.010 --> 00:23:17.020
graph boundaries how this works is you
 

00:23:17.020 --> 00:23:19.409
graph boundaries how this works is you
remove your ID and declare deep link in

00:23:19.409 --> 00:23:19.419
remove your ID and declare deep link in
 

00:23:19.419 --> 00:23:22.310
remove your ID and declare deep link in
here with a URI it can host the

00:23:22.310 --> 00:23:22.320
here with a URI it can host the
 

00:23:22.320 --> 00:23:25.049
here with a URI it can host the
parameter for the for a user ID so you

00:23:25.049 --> 00:23:25.059
parameter for the for a user ID so you
 

00:23:25.059 --> 00:23:26.909
parameter for the for a user ID so you
can jump directly into the user fragment

00:23:26.909 --> 00:23:26.919
can jump directly into the user fragment
 

00:23:26.919 --> 00:23:29.700
can jump directly into the user fragment
and start chatting with your friends

00:23:29.700 --> 00:23:29.710
and start chatting with your friends
 

00:23:29.710 --> 00:23:30.850
and start chatting with your friends
right away

00:23:30.850 --> 00:23:30.860
right away

right away
so you're not longer have to hold on to

00:23:32.710 --> 00:23:32.720
so you're not longer have to hold on to

so you're not longer have to hold on to
IDs you no longer in the modularize that

IDs you no longer in the modularize that
 

00:23:34.549 --> 00:23:35.620
IDs you no longer in the modularize that

would have to have them in a shared
 

00:23:35.630 --> 00:23:38.830
would have to have them in a shared
space instead of that you have your your

00:23:38.830 --> 00:23:38.840
space instead of that you have your your
 

00:23:38.840 --> 00:23:40.990
space instead of that you have your your
eyes that you can share across the

00:23:40.990 --> 00:23:41.000
eyes that you can share across the
 

00:23:41.000 --> 00:23:44.230
eyes that you can share across the
application and within the friendless

simply build up the URI and navigate to

00:23:48.610 --> 00:23:48.620
simply build up the URI and navigate to
 

00:23:48.620 --> 00:23:57.100
simply build up the URI and navigate to
our destination another problem that

00:23:57.100 --> 00:23:57.110
our destination another problem that
 

00:23:57.110 --> 00:23:59.110
our destination another problem that
comes as we came across is when you

00:23:59.110 --> 00:23:59.120
comes as we came across is when you
 

00:23:59.120 --> 00:24:01.000
comes as we came across is when you
navigate not within an app that has

00:24:01.000 --> 00:24:01.010
navigate not within an app that has
 

00:24:01.010 --> 00:24:02.620
navigate not within an app that has
library modules but one that has dynamic

00:24:02.620 --> 00:24:02.630
library modules but one that has dynamic
 

00:24:02.630 --> 00:24:04.659
library modules but one that has dynamic
feature modules the question out here is

00:24:04.659 --> 00:24:04.669
feature modules the question out here is
 

00:24:04.669 --> 00:24:08.649
feature modules the question out here is
where are we going with this libraries

00:24:08.649 --> 00:24:08.659
where are we going with this libraries
 

00:24:08.659 --> 00:24:11.440
where are we going with this libraries
can so as you can see the dynamic

00:24:11.440 --> 00:24:11.450
can so as you can see the dynamic
 

00:24:11.450 --> 00:24:12.549
can so as you can see the dynamic
feature modules have a bit of a

00:24:12.549 --> 00:24:12.559
feature modules have a bit of a
 

00:24:12.559 --> 00:24:14.169
feature modules have a bit of a
different way that the dependencies are

00:24:14.169 --> 00:24:14.179
different way that the dependencies are
 

00:24:14.179 --> 00:24:16.389
different way that the dependencies are
on one another so they can't depend on

00:24:16.389 --> 00:24:16.399
on one another so they can't depend on
 

00:24:16.399 --> 00:24:17.710
on one another so they can't depend on
the app and it's really tricky to

00:24:17.710 --> 00:24:17.720
the app and it's really tricky to
 

00:24:17.720 --> 00:24:20.560
the app and it's really tricky to
navigate between those features when it

00:24:20.560 --> 00:24:20.570
navigate between those features when it
 

00:24:20.570 --> 00:24:23.049
navigate between those features when it
comes to modules that are not on device

00:24:23.049 --> 00:24:23.059
comes to modules that are not on device
 

00:24:23.059 --> 00:24:25.480
comes to modules that are not on device
in particular dynamic feature modules

00:24:25.480 --> 00:24:25.490
in particular dynamic feature modules
 

00:24:25.490 --> 00:24:26.950
in particular dynamic feature modules
can be installed initially or can be

00:24:26.950 --> 00:24:26.960
can be installed initially or can be
 

00:24:26.960 --> 00:24:29.940
can be installed initially or can be
downloaded later on we've heard

00:24:29.940 --> 00:24:29.950
downloaded later on we've heard
 

00:24:29.950 --> 00:24:32.769
downloaded later on we've heard
questions around this over the past year

00:24:32.769 --> 00:24:32.779
questions around this over the past year
 

00:24:32.779 --> 00:24:36.820
questions around this over the past year
and we thought about it and we are we

00:24:36.820 --> 00:24:36.830
and we thought about it and we are we
 

00:24:36.830 --> 00:24:39.310
and we thought about it and we are we
have started to work on a new library

00:24:39.310 --> 00:24:39.320
have started to work on a new library
 

00:24:39.320 --> 00:24:41.590
have started to work on a new library
that is extending the navigation library

00:24:41.590 --> 00:24:41.600
that is extending the navigation library
 

00:24:41.600 --> 00:24:44.440
that is extending the navigation library
that will allow you to intercept

00:24:44.440 --> 00:24:44.450
that will allow you to intercept
 

00:24:44.450 --> 00:24:47.680
that will allow you to intercept
navigating to separate destinations then

00:24:47.680 --> 00:24:47.690
navigating to separate destinations then
 

00:24:47.690 --> 00:24:50.230
navigating to separate destinations then
if the module that we're looking for is

00:24:50.230 --> 00:24:50.240
if the module that we're looking for is
 

00:24:50.240 --> 00:24:52.419
if the module that we're looking for is
not installed it will take care of all

00:24:52.419 --> 00:24:52.429
not installed it will take care of all
 

00:24:52.429 --> 00:24:54.370
not installed it will take care of all
the downloading for that provides you

00:24:54.370 --> 00:24:54.380
the downloading for that provides you
 

00:24:54.380 --> 00:24:56.379
the downloading for that provides you
with a couple of feet with a couple of

all what it does is it directs you
 

00:25:13.159 --> 00:25:16.629
all what it does is it directs you
directly to your target destination we

directly to your target destination we
just looked in a bit of the future what

00:25:18.610 --> 00:25:18.620
just looked in a bit of the future what
 

00:25:18.620 --> 00:25:22.240
just looked in a bit of the future what
we're what's in store for for navigation

00:25:22.240 --> 00:25:22.250
we're what's in store for for navigation
 

00:25:22.250 --> 00:25:24.399
we're what's in store for for navigation
and to talk a little bit more about the

00:25:24.399 --> 00:25:24.409
and to talk a little bit more about the
 

00:25:24.409 --> 00:25:25.840
and to talk a little bit more about the
bigger picture here let me know invite

00:25:25.840 --> 00:25:25.850
bigger picture here let me know invite
 

00:25:25.850 --> 00:25:32.630
bigger picture here let me know invite
back in

00:25:32.630 --> 00:25:32.640
 

00:25:32.640 --> 00:25:35.070
thanks Ben I'm really excited about the

00:25:35.070 --> 00:25:35.080
thanks Ben I'm really excited about the
 

00:25:35.080 --> 00:25:37.320
thanks Ben I'm really excited about the
dynamic feature navigation and looking

00:25:37.320 --> 00:25:37.330
dynamic feature navigation and looking
 

00:25:37.330 --> 00:25:38.910
dynamic feature navigation and looking
forward to seeing that later this year

00:25:38.910 --> 00:25:38.920
forward to seeing that later this year
 

00:25:38.920 --> 00:25:41.160
forward to seeing that later this year
but I want to talk a little bit more

00:25:41.160 --> 00:25:41.170
but I want to talk a little bit more
 

00:25:41.170 --> 00:25:43.169
but I want to talk a little bit more
generally about just where we're going

00:25:43.169 --> 00:25:43.179
generally about just where we're going
 

00:25:43.179 --> 00:25:45.390
generally about just where we're going
with navigation so I realized it took us

00:25:45.390 --> 00:25:45.400
with navigation so I realized it took us
 

00:25:45.400 --> 00:25:47.940
with navigation so I realized it took us
a while to get to that 1.0 stable

00:25:47.940 --> 00:25:47.950
a while to get to that 1.0 stable
 

00:25:47.950 --> 00:25:51.150
a while to get to that 1.0 stable
release but from now on what we're

00:25:51.150 --> 00:25:51.160
release but from now on what we're
 

00:25:51.160 --> 00:25:53.040
release but from now on what we're
trying to move towards is a much faster

00:25:53.040 --> 00:25:53.050
trying to move towards is a much faster
 

00:25:53.050 --> 00:25:56.850
trying to move towards is a much faster
iteration time so the time between the

00:25:56.850 --> 00:25:56.860
iteration time so the time between the
 

00:25:56.860 --> 00:25:59.940
iteration time so the time between the
first alpha and the first release 2 beta

00:25:59.940 --> 00:25:59.950
first alpha and the first release 2 beta
 

00:25:59.950 --> 00:26:03.600
first alpha and the first release 2 beta
2 RC 2 stable realize that not everyone

00:26:03.600 --> 00:26:03.610
2 RC 2 stable realize that not everyone
 

00:26:03.610 --> 00:26:06.810
2 RC 2 stable realize that not everyone
is happy using the latest latest alpha

00:26:06.810 --> 00:26:06.820
is happy using the latest latest alpha
 

00:26:06.820 --> 00:26:08.850
is happy using the latest latest alpha
release and sometimes a little bit of

00:26:08.850 --> 00:26:08.860
release and sometimes a little bit of
 

00:26:08.860 --> 00:26:11.280
release and sometimes a little bit of
that stability or at least the word

00:26:11.280 --> 00:26:11.290
that stability or at least the word
 

00:26:11.290 --> 00:26:14.220
that stability or at least the word
stable or the lack of the word alpha can

00:26:14.220 --> 00:26:14.230
stable or the lack of the word alpha can
 

00:26:14.230 --> 00:26:16.830
stable or the lack of the word alpha can
really help win over PM's who aren't as

00:26:16.830 --> 00:26:16.840
really help win over PM's who aren't as
 

00:26:16.840 --> 00:26:19.350
really help win over PM's who aren't as
familiar with what alpha means for

00:26:19.350 --> 00:26:19.360
familiar with what alpha means for
 

00:26:19.360 --> 00:26:21.060
familiar with what alpha means for
navigation so we're really trying to

00:26:21.060 --> 00:26:21.070
navigation so we're really trying to
 

00:26:21.070 --> 00:26:24.000
navigation so we're really trying to
focus on just a small set of features so

00:26:24.000 --> 00:26:24.010
focus on just a small set of features so
 

00:26:24.010 --> 00:26:26.010
focus on just a small set of features so
what we talked about today we're the

00:26:26.010 --> 00:26:26.020
what we talked about today we're the
 

00:26:26.020 --> 00:26:28.770
what we talked about today we're the
core the features in navigation 2.1 at

00:26:28.770 --> 00:26:28.780
core the features in navigation 2.1 at
 

00:26:28.780 --> 00:26:30.419
core the features in navigation 2.1 at
this point we're saying like no let's

00:26:30.419 --> 00:26:30.429
this point we're saying like no let's
 

00:26:30.429 --> 00:26:33.270
this point we're saying like no let's
cut it off here and let's go towards

00:26:33.270 --> 00:26:33.280
cut it off here and let's go towards
 

00:26:33.280 --> 00:26:36.180
cut it off here and let's go towards
beta and RC and stable now rather than

00:26:36.180 --> 00:26:36.190
beta and RC and stable now rather than
 

00:26:36.190 --> 00:26:38.370
beta and RC and stable now rather than
continuing to add features over and over

00:26:38.370 --> 00:26:38.380
continuing to add features over and over
 

00:26:38.380 --> 00:26:40.470
continuing to add features over and over
again but that doesn't mean that we're

00:26:40.470 --> 00:26:40.480
again but that doesn't mean that we're
 

00:26:40.480 --> 00:26:42.720
again but that doesn't mean that we're
not working on more things there's

00:26:42.720 --> 00:26:42.730
not working on more things there's
 

00:26:42.730 --> 00:26:44.669
not working on more things there's
certainly a lot more dynamic feature

00:26:44.669 --> 00:26:44.679
certainly a lot more dynamic feature
 

00:26:44.679 --> 00:26:47.220
certainly a lot more dynamic feature
navigator is one thing but we're also

00:26:47.220 --> 00:26:47.230
navigator is one thing but we're also
 

00:26:47.230 --> 00:26:50.130
navigator is one thing but we're also
really looking at your feedback so we

00:26:50.130 --> 00:26:50.140
really looking at your feedback so we
 

00:26:50.140 --> 00:26:52.950
really looking at your feedback so we
have and we use the issue tracker Google

00:26:52.950 --> 00:26:52.960
have and we use the issue tracker Google
 

00:26:52.960 --> 00:26:55.470
have and we use the issue tracker Google
comm extensively particularly for

00:26:55.470 --> 00:26:55.480
comm extensively particularly for
 

00:26:55.480 --> 00:26:57.480
comm extensively particularly for
navigation and all these counts here are

00:26:57.480 --> 00:26:57.490
navigation and all these counts here are
 

00:26:57.490 --> 00:26:59.790
navigation and all these counts here are
actually the number of stars that you

00:26:59.790 --> 00:26:59.800
actually the number of stars that you
 

00:26:59.800 --> 00:27:02.340
actually the number of stars that you
all have given for navigation features

00:27:02.340 --> 00:27:02.350
all have given for navigation features
 

00:27:02.350 --> 00:27:04.500
all have given for navigation features
and we can see we've done pretty good we

00:27:04.500 --> 00:27:04.510
and we can see we've done pretty good we
 

00:27:04.510 --> 00:27:06.810
and we can see we've done pretty good we
fixed we fixed a fair few of them some

00:27:06.810 --> 00:27:06.820
fixed we fixed a fair few of them some
 

00:27:06.820 --> 00:27:08.010
fixed we fixed a fair few of them some
of these are actually fixed in

00:27:08.010 --> 00:27:08.020
of these are actually fixed in
 

00:27:08.020 --> 00:27:10.700
of these are actually fixed in
navigation 2.1 based on your feedback

00:27:10.700 --> 00:27:10.710
navigation 2.1 based on your feedback
 

00:27:10.710 --> 00:27:13.830
navigation 2.1 based on your feedback
but there's still a few more to do and

00:27:13.830 --> 00:27:13.840
but there's still a few more to do and
 

00:27:13.840 --> 00:27:15.990
but there's still a few more to do and
you know if it's not in two point one

00:27:15.990 --> 00:27:16.000
you know if it's not in two point one
 

00:27:16.000 --> 00:27:19.200
you know if it's not in two point one
that's gonna be in 2.2 or 2.3 as we go

00:27:19.200 --> 00:27:19.210
that's gonna be in 2.2 or 2.3 as we go
 

00:27:19.210 --> 00:27:20.850
that's gonna be in 2.2 or 2.3 as we go
through things we realize some of these

00:27:20.850 --> 00:27:20.860
through things we realize some of these
 

00:27:20.860 --> 00:27:22.680
through things we realize some of these
things like multiple back stacks are

00:27:22.680 --> 00:27:22.690
things like multiple back stacks are
 

00:27:22.690 --> 00:27:25.890
things like multiple back stacks are
very highly requested and they do mean

00:27:25.890 --> 00:27:25.900
very highly requested and they do mean
 

00:27:25.900 --> 00:27:27.660
very highly requested and they do mean
that we also need to work on the

00:27:27.660 --> 00:27:27.670
that we also need to work on the
 

00:27:27.670 --> 00:27:30.030
that we also need to work on the
underlying libraries so for example that

00:27:30.030 --> 00:27:30.040
underlying libraries so for example that
 

00:27:30.040 --> 00:27:32.100
underlying libraries so for example that
one we should probably get that working

00:27:32.100 --> 00:27:32.110
one we should probably get that working
 

00:27:32.110 --> 00:27:33.600
one we should probably get that working
in fragments and then working in

00:27:33.600 --> 00:27:33.610
in fragments and then working in
 

00:27:33.610 --> 00:27:35.400
in fragments and then working in
navigation as well and that's certainly

00:27:35.400 --> 00:27:35.410
navigation as well and that's certainly
 

00:27:35.410 --> 00:27:37.890
navigation as well and that's certainly
bigger efforts but it's something that

00:27:37.890 --> 00:27:37.900
bigger efforts but it's something that
 

00:27:37.900 --> 00:27:40.080
bigger efforts but it's something that
we're dedicated to do and something that

00:27:40.080 --> 00:27:40.090
we're dedicated to do and something that
 

00:27:40.090 --> 00:27:43.290
we're dedicated to do and something that
we think that would be great to have out

00:27:43.290 --> 00:27:43.300
we think that would be great to have out
 

00:27:43.300 --> 00:27:47.400
we think that would be great to have out
to all of you in the near future so I'd

00:27:47.400 --> 00:27:47.410
to all of you in the near future so I'd
 

00:27:47.410 --> 00:27:50.010
to all of you in the near future so I'd
really like to continue if you have more

00:27:50.010 --> 00:27:50.020
really like to continue if you have more
 

00:27:50.020 --> 00:27:52.590
really like to continue if you have more
feature requests bug reports anything

00:27:52.590 --> 00:27:52.600
feature requests bug reports anything
 

00:27:52.600 --> 00:27:55.680
feature requests bug reports anything
please let us know if we can find an

00:27:55.680 --> 00:27:55.690
please let us know if we can find an
 

00:27:55.690 --> 00:27:56.730
please let us know if we can find an
issue for it already

00:27:56.730 --> 00:27:56.740
issue for it already
 

00:27:56.740 --> 00:27:58.560
issue for it already
we'll certainly happy to look at that

00:27:58.560 --> 00:27:58.570
we'll certainly happy to look at that
 

00:27:58.570 --> 00:28:01.530
we'll certainly happy to look at that
but your stars really do Drive the

00:28:01.530 --> 00:28:01.540
but your stars really do Drive the
 

00:28:01.540 --> 00:28:03.060
but your stars really do Drive the
future of navigation

00:28:03.060 --> 00:28:03.070
future of navigation
 

00:28:03.070 --> 00:28:24.980
future of navigation
