00:00:00.590 --> 00:00:04.928
And the answer is that Y1
should be 3 and Y2 should be 0.

00:00:04.928 --> 00:00:07.980
&gt;From looking at the bound we see
that we want them both to be small.

00:00:07.980 --> 00:00:12.310
And looking at the constraints
we see that the non negativity

00:00:12.310 --> 00:00:14.830
implies that this one
will always be met.

00:00:14.830 --> 00:00:16.510
So we can more or
less ignore that constraint.

00:00:17.570 --> 00:00:22.620
An increase in Y2 here actually
enforces us to increase Y1 as well.

00:00:22.620 --> 00:00:29.894
So it should be clear that Y2 is zero,
and from that it follows that Y1 is 3.

00:00:29.894 --> 00:00:33.459
Now you might have used some reasoning
like that, or you could have recognized

00:00:33.459 --> 00:00:37.670
that what you were doing here was
really solving another linear program.

00:00:37.670 --> 00:00:41.900
I asked you to minimize
a linear function subject

00:00:41.900 --> 00:00:47.450
to a set of linear constraints and
the non-negativity of the variables.

00:00:47.450 --> 00:00:49.590
This, then, is the essence of duality.

00:00:49.590 --> 00:00:52.990
In trying to obtain a tight
bound on one linear program,

00:00:52.990 --> 00:00:54.280
we end up with another one.
