00:00:00.140 --> 00:00:02.930
So to calculate how much sales
tax you pay on this $40,

00:00:02.930 --> 00:00:04.790
we have to first convert
this to a decimal.

00:00:04.790 --> 00:00:09.518
And by moving the decimal place to
the left we find that it's 0.0675.

00:00:09.518 --> 00:00:14.836
To calculate how much we pay in dollars,
we have to multiply this by $40.

00:00:14.836 --> 00:00:19.001
And that gives me 40 times 0.0675 and

00:00:19.001 --> 00:00:24.601
we need to use a calculator for
this, 2.7 or $2.70.
