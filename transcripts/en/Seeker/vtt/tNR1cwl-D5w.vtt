00:00:00.140 --> 00:00:04.310
Every mission to space must go through a proper
cleaning procedure before launch.

00:00:04.310 --> 00:00:06.370
But how clean are they really?

00:00:06.370 --> 00:00:10.890
Cleaning spacecraft is to prevent contamination
of any place explored in space.

00:00:10.890 --> 00:00:13.040
AKA planetary protection.

00:00:13.040 --> 00:00:17.830
Planetary Protection was set-up in 1967 as
part of an international law known as The

00:00:17.830 --> 00:00:19.110
Outer Space Treaty.

00:00:19.110 --> 00:00:23.109
It was set up to limit the amount of Earth
organisms that go into space.

00:00:23.109 --> 00:00:28.109
If say an Earth microbe were to land on another
planet through one of our missions, it could

00:00:28.109 --> 00:00:32.660
cause major cross-contamination issues when
collecting samples from that planet.

00:00:32.660 --> 00:00:35.170
This can cause problems with data analyses.

00:00:35.170 --> 00:00:40.030
If something from Earth mixes with something
on another planet--how can we tell the difference

00:00:40.030 --> 00:00:42.030
between say us and an alien?!

00:00:42.030 --> 00:00:46.719
Not to mention if an organism from Earth were
to land in a region where there’s high chance

00:00:46.719 --> 00:00:51.399
that life can survive----can someone say accidental
colonization?

00:00:51.399 --> 00:00:56.660
A possible example is, there are places on
Mars with the potential of harboring water.

00:00:56.660 --> 00:01:01.640
I’d hate to imagine an Earth microbe landing
there and accidentally spawning life.

00:01:01.640 --> 00:01:05.089
This is why we make sure to clean stuff that
goes to space.

00:01:05.089 --> 00:01:09.550
In order to prevent biological contamination
amongst the planets in our solar system and

00:01:09.550 --> 00:01:15.360
beyond, an international agency known as COSPAR
has set these guidelines for launching missions

00:01:15.360 --> 00:01:18.040
into space depending on where they are going.

00:01:18.040 --> 00:01:24.229
So for federal space agencies, rules and guidelines
are mandatory and proper cleaning is monitored.

00:01:24.229 --> 00:01:28.390
But private sector space agencies don’t
necessarily have to follow the same rules

00:01:28.390 --> 00:01:29.810
for recent missions.

00:01:29.810 --> 00:01:34.250
Because there is currently little framework
overseeing “non-traditional” commercial

00:01:34.250 --> 00:01:35.540
space missions.

00:01:35.540 --> 00:01:40.190
AKA sending humans into orbit, a rover to
the Moon or... a Tesla to space.

00:01:40.190 --> 00:01:41.190
These are things not listed in the treaty.

00:01:41.190 --> 00:01:45.360
Which is why the government is trying to pass
what’s known as the American Space Commerce

00:01:45.360 --> 00:01:47.090
Free Enterprise Act.

00:01:47.090 --> 00:01:51.540
Right now before a company launches anything
they must first go through the Federal Aviation

00:01:51.540 --> 00:01:54.500
Administration to get a license to launch.

00:01:54.500 --> 00:02:01.240
The only thing is.. once the payload separates
in space, the FAA no longer has authority...

00:02:01.240 --> 00:02:05.530
Depending on where the mission will go, COSPAR
will determine the extent of sterilization.

00:02:05.530 --> 00:02:09.930
If you’re sending something like a rover,
that will touch the surface of a planet--then

00:02:09.930 --> 00:02:12.090
it’s time to start baking!

00:02:12.090 --> 00:02:17.300
This is a procedure used to clean the surface
of spacecraft of any earthly organisms.

00:02:17.300 --> 00:02:21.510
They do this by putting the spacecraft under
very high amounts of heat for an extended

00:02:21.510 --> 00:02:22.730
period of time.

00:02:22.730 --> 00:02:25.840
Like 111 degrees Celsius for 30 hours.

00:02:25.840 --> 00:02:30.560
They can also use chemical cleaning with chemical
sterilizers like alcohol or UV irradiation.

00:02:30.560 --> 00:02:35.790
Of course, some organisms can still survive
-- so no method is perfect.

00:02:35.790 --> 00:02:42.070
The PPO allows for up to 300,000 spores on
a spacecraft, which may seem like a lot, but

00:02:42.070 --> 00:02:44.140
they’d all fit on the head of a large pin.

00:02:44.140 --> 00:02:49.120
So doing multiple and thorough cleaning procedures
is a MUST to be sure there are minimal lingering

00:02:49.120 --> 00:02:50.620
Earth microbes.

00:02:50.620 --> 00:02:54.610
Knowing that… what I’m wondering is, if
we have these strict regulations for when

00:02:54.610 --> 00:02:58.970
things LEAVE Earth, then what happens when
things ENTER Earth from elsewhere in the solar

00:02:58.970 --> 00:02:59.970
system?

00:02:59.970 --> 00:03:03.230
Couldn’t they, too, contain contamination
from another planet?

00:03:03.230 --> 00:03:06.129
Like meteorites that have landed here from
Mars...?

00:03:06.129 --> 00:03:10.159
Things that could survive in space are called
extremophiles, and they might exist inside

00:03:10.159 --> 00:03:14.099
rocks on Mars, but to get in there we’ll
have to crack them open.

00:03:14.099 --> 00:03:17.870
Our sister show, Science in the Extremes looks
at that... here.

00:03:17.870 --> 00:03:23.040
One last thing, Elon’s red Tesla roadster
did get licensed by the FAA for the launch…

00:03:23.040 --> 00:03:25.390
but does that mean it got cleaned?

00:03:25.390 --> 00:03:27.900
SpaceX has yet to comment on that.
