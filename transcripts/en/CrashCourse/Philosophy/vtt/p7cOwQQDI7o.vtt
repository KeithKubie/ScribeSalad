00:00:03.040 --> 00:00:05.950
For most of you, your parents brought you
into this world.

00:00:05.950 --> 00:00:09.150
They also fed you, and changed your diapers,
and wiped your tears.

00:00:09.150 --> 00:00:10.630
They raised you.

00:00:10.630 --> 00:00:17.210
Yet, according to contemporary American philosopher Jane English, once you’re grown, you don’t owe your parents anything.

00:00:17.210 --> 00:00:18.880
Not a single thing.

00:00:18.880 --> 00:00:22.460
Now, this might sound a little selfish.
A little ungrateful. A little mean.

00:00:22.460 --> 00:00:23.580
But let’s hear her out.

00:00:23.580 --> 00:00:33.580
Because, you’ve learned by now that many of your default attitudes – the attitudes that you think you have about other beings, and your relationships to them – have a hard time standing up to philosophical scrutiny.

00:00:33.580 --> 00:00:37.580
So let’s scrutinize one of the most important
relationships you have in your life –

00:00:37.580 --> 00:00:42.060
the one that you’ve had the longest, and
probably the most intimate one you’ll ever have.

00:00:42.060 --> 00:00:43.940
Let’s talk about your folks.

00:00:43.950 --> 00:00:54.490
[Theme Music]

00:00:54.490 --> 00:00:57.760
There are three basic views about the obligations
you have to your parents.

00:00:57.760 --> 00:00:59.980
One is the unconditional view.

00:00:59.980 --> 00:01:10.350
This is the view that, simply by virtue of being your parent, that person is entitled to certain things from you – at a bare minimum, your presence and attention in their lives – until one of you dies.

00:01:10.360 --> 00:01:15.200
By contrast, the conditional view says that
you owe your parents based on what they gave you.

00:01:15.200 --> 00:01:20.320
So, really terrible parents might not deserve anything from their grown children, but good parents deserve quite a lot.

00:01:20.320 --> 00:01:24.220
So your level of obligation is based on the
amount of benefit that you received growing up.

00:01:24.220 --> 00:01:27.220
And finally there’s English’s view, known
as the friendship view.

00:01:27.220 --> 00:01:32.680
This says that you don’t actually owe your parents anything once you’ve grown, regardless of how much you benefited from their parenting.

00:01:32.680 --> 00:01:41.040
Many of us take it as basic that we owe our parents a lot – what with all of the feeding and nurturing and driving to soccer games and acting like they enjoyed our macaroni art.

00:01:41.040 --> 00:01:43.540
But English makes a couple of observations
about this assumption.

00:01:43.540 --> 00:01:47.320
First, she says, if anything it’s the parents
who owe their kids.

00:01:47.320 --> 00:01:53.580
After all, if you choose to have a child, you incur a huge responsibility to raise that child, or to give it away to someone who will.

00:01:53.580 --> 00:01:56.460
So it’s basically a contractarian relationship.

00:01:56.460 --> 00:02:02.320
If you agree to do something, then you have a duty to see it through, or to extract yourself from the contract.

00:02:02.320 --> 00:02:07.880
And that is the line of reasoning that leads English to conclude that grown kids don’t owe their parents back.

00:02:07.880 --> 00:02:09.880
Because none of us chose to be born.

00:02:09.880 --> 00:02:13.360
And you can’t have an obligation if you
didn’t do something to incur that obligation.

00:02:13.360 --> 00:02:21.220
Now, you might be thinking, fine, if you want to think of family relationships in terms of contracts, then isn’t there still an implicit contract between child and parent?

00:02:21.220 --> 00:02:29.620
If you’ve reaped the benefits of being raised by good, loving parents, doesn’t it mean that you’ve implicitly accepted the contract, and have therefore incurred obligations?

00:02:29.620 --> 00:02:33.300
The problem with that is, children can’t
really enter into moral contracts.

00:02:33.300 --> 00:02:41.080
If, as an adult, you enter into an agreement with your parents – like, you can live at home for free as long as you maintain your grades in college – then you’ve got yourself a contract.

00:02:41.080 --> 00:02:50.680
But any benefits incurred while growing up don’t count, because, back when the relationship started, you were just a baby, and you didn’t have the rational capacity to be held to a moral contract.

00:02:50.680 --> 00:02:54.800
And what’s more, your parents didn’t provide
for you with the expectation of a payout.

00:02:54.800 --> 00:03:00.900
They had you – or they kept you or adopted you – because they wanted you, and they gave to you because they wanted to.

00:03:00.900 --> 00:03:02.960
Good parents give unconditionally.

00:03:02.960 --> 00:03:08.620
So no matter how much you receive from them, you simply don’t incur debt, because that’s not how family works.

00:03:08.629 --> 00:03:12.309
Now, to be clear, English isn’t giving us
a pass to freeload off our parents.

00:03:12.309 --> 00:03:17.669
She thinks that, if you have a good relationship with your parents, you’ll probably want to help them out when you can, but that’s not an obligation.

00:03:17.669 --> 00:03:20.749
Instead, she says, the appropriate model is
friendship.

00:03:20.749 --> 00:03:23.689
Friends don’t keep score – they help each
other out of love.

00:03:23.689 --> 00:03:28.980
And in loving relationships, no one’s keeping a hidden tally of who helped last and who’s due to help next.

00:03:28.980 --> 00:03:33.260
You don’t have to keep score; you give simply
because you want to, out of love.

00:03:33.260 --> 00:03:38.060
So English argues that, once you’re an adult, your relationship with your parents should model that of friendship.

00:03:38.060 --> 00:03:42.151
And the thing about friends is, if the love
isn’t there, the friendship dissolves.

00:03:42.160 --> 00:03:45.079
You have no underlying obligation to remain
friends with someone.

00:03:45.080 --> 00:03:53.620
And likewise, if you had bad parents, or if you simply don’t care about them once you’re an adult, you have no obligation to give them anything – including your time.

00:03:53.620 --> 00:04:00.940
You didn’t incur a debt by being raised, she says, so just like with friendship, you can choose not to maintain a relationship with your parents.

00:04:00.940 --> 00:04:01.880
It’s up to you.

00:04:01.889 --> 00:04:04.029
Now, this attitude might seem scandalous to
some people.

00:04:04.029 --> 00:04:06.199
I mean, isn’t blood thicker than water?

00:04:06.200 --> 00:04:12.260
Well, many philosophers challenge the idea that you have special obligations to someone just because you share some genetic material with them.

00:04:12.260 --> 00:04:20.980
By that logic, a person who was adopted at birth would have obligations to biological relatives that they’ve never met – and they wouldn’t have any obligations to the family that raised them.

00:04:20.989 --> 00:04:23.230
And I think most of us can agree that that
doesn’t make any sense.

00:04:23.230 --> 00:04:27.790
We tend to think of adopted families as being
no less familial than biological families.

00:04:27.790 --> 00:04:37.620
So if you think families are built through love and not blood, then it follows that families lacking in love can’t make moral demands on its members, because they simply don’t have the standing.

00:04:37.620 --> 00:04:41.440
While we’re talking about parents here, let’s stop
by the Thought Bubble for some Flash Philosophy.

00:04:41.440 --> 00:04:46.860
Before you’re trusted to do something that has the potential to cause harm, you have to demonstrate that you can handle it.

00:04:46.860 --> 00:04:49.120
In most societies, this is done through licensing.

00:04:49.120 --> 00:04:55.360
Driver’s licenses, hunting licenses, wedding licenses – heck, barbers even need to be certified before they can cut your hair!

00:04:55.360 --> 00:05:01.360
So, contemporary American philosopher Hugh LaFollette thinks that there’s another group of people who should be licensed – parents.

00:05:01.360 --> 00:05:09.540
That’s right, LaFollette thinks potential parents should be required to apply for and obtain a license before being permitted to reproduce.

00:05:09.540 --> 00:05:11.540
This sounds kind of ridiculous, right?

00:05:11.540 --> 00:05:12.680
But think about it.

00:05:12.680 --> 00:05:19.000
Most activities that require competence to do well, and that can cause harm if done badly, are regulated by society.

00:05:19.000 --> 00:05:23.360
There’s no question that parenting isn’t easy, and
you can really mess up a kid if you do it badly.

00:05:23.360 --> 00:05:28.560
But right now, we wait until a parent has abused
or neglected a child before the state intervenes.

00:05:28.560 --> 00:05:33.380
So, LaFollette asks, wouldn’t it be better
if we took preventative measures instead?

00:05:33.390 --> 00:05:37.460
After all, adoptive parents undergo heavy
scrutiny before they get to have kids.

00:05:37.460 --> 00:05:43.260
So, just like driving a car, in LaFollette’s plan, you’d have to pass a test before you could get a parenting license.

00:05:43.260 --> 00:05:47.000
There’d be classes for those who need it,
and you can always reapply.

00:05:47.000 --> 00:05:51.980
But if you can’t demonstrate a basic ability to
raise a child, then you just don’t get to have one.

00:05:51.980 --> 00:05:52.940
What do you think?

00:05:52.940 --> 00:05:57.080
Would society be better or worse if you needed
a license to raise children?

00:05:57.090 --> 00:05:59.900
Does everyone have the right to be a parent?

00:05:59.900 --> 00:06:05.340
Or should you have to demonstrate that you’re up to the task before you’re allowed to bring a new human being into the world?

00:06:05.340 --> 00:06:06.480
Thanks, Thought Bubble!

00:06:06.490 --> 00:06:10.650
Now, here’s yet another perspective on the
philosophy of family obligations.

00:06:10.650 --> 00:06:17.180
Contemporary American philosopher Claudia Mills argues that there’s something truly special about what you have with your family.

00:06:17.180 --> 00:06:25.660
Your family members are the only people in your life that are permanent and unchosen, she says, and because of that, there’s value in maintaining a connection with them.

00:06:25.670 --> 00:06:28.870
Mills points out that we live in a world where
we’re constantly changing.

00:06:28.870 --> 00:06:35.110
Most of us will have many different jobs, and live in lots of different places, and go through a great many friends, maybe even a couple of spouses.

00:06:35.110 --> 00:06:40.310
But there will come a time when there are very few people left in your life who have known you since the beginning.

00:06:40.310 --> 00:06:46.070
Mills thinks that your family allows you to stay connected to the person you once were, before all those changes happened.

00:06:46.070 --> 00:06:50.850
And, even if you aren’t really that person anymore, that connection can be grounding, and valuable.

00:06:50.850 --> 00:06:52.900
So go ahead, call your brother on his birthday!

00:06:52.900 --> 00:06:55.540
Remind him of the time he tried to dry his
socks in a frying pan!

00:06:55.540 --> 00:06:59.920
In addition to getting a good laugh out of it, your brother might appreciate re-connecting with his roots.

00:06:59.920 --> 00:07:09.080
Now, you might have noticed that this is the first time our discussion of ethics has focused on personal, individual connections – on feelings of love, rather than on impartiality.

00:07:09.080 --> 00:07:13.240
This is characteristic of a school of moral
thought known as the ethics of care.

00:07:13.240 --> 00:07:20.160
Contrary to most of the theories we’ve studied, this view says that morality demands that we pay attention to the special relationships we have in our lives.

00:07:20.160 --> 00:07:28.280
The ethics of care says that morality goes wrong when we emphasize impartiality, because it’s our most caring relationships that make our lives worthwhile.

00:07:28.280 --> 00:07:31.880
And we want our friends and family to care
more for us than they do for strangers, right?

00:07:31.880 --> 00:07:37.220
So ethicists of care often reason that, even though we might have a general love for humanity itself,

00:07:37.220 --> 00:07:47.540
you just can’t beat the unconditional, I-would-literally-die-for-you love that we only have for the people we know best, the ones with whom we share an intimacy that we simply can’t feel with strangers.

00:07:47.540 --> 00:07:48.980
What could the harm be in that?

00:07:48.980 --> 00:07:54.320
Well, many ethicists worry that showing preference for the people you happen to like opens up the door for prejudice.

00:07:54.320 --> 00:07:58.880
Because it’s easy to be kind to people you
like – you don’t need morality to tell you that.

00:07:58.880 --> 00:08:05.700
The hard part is being kind to people you don’t like, or who are different from you, or who you simply don’t know or understand very well.

00:08:05.700 --> 00:08:12.260
It would be great if everyone had a support network of people who love them, so we’d just all take care of our own loved ones, and life would be perfect.

00:08:12.260 --> 00:08:16.820
But the problem is, there are a lot of people who aren’t lucky enough to have support networks of care.

00:08:16.820 --> 00:08:21.960
And there are others who have people who care about them, but their loved ones lack the resources to actually provide for them.

00:08:21.960 --> 00:08:25.940
If we rely on ethics of care, it looks like
those people will get neglected.

00:08:25.940 --> 00:08:31.720
So we’re going to talk about this next time, when we discuss poverty, and the moral obligations we have to strangers in need.

00:08:31.720 --> 00:08:34.639
But today we talked about moral obligations
to family.

00:08:34.640 --> 00:08:42.980
We considered the possibility of licensing parents, and we talked about the ethics of care, and some potential problems that type of approach to morality carries with it.
