00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.850
While we're recording these, actually we thought it wasn't a very challenging example

00:00:04.850 --> 00:00:10.430
and then we got it wrong about 4 times, but the correct answer here is that these three lines

00:00:10.430 --> 00:00:13.300
take 11 time steps to execute.

00:00:13.300 --> 00:00:19.270
The first line is free as in the first quiz and the second line is actually why we had

00:00:19.270 --> 00:00:22.160
to count a few times until we all got it right.

00:00:22.160 --> 00:00:27.870
This line here is executed 6 times--once for s=5

00:00:27.870 --> 00:00:32.549
and then s is decreased by 1 each time this line down here is executed.

00:00:32.549 --> 00:00:40.520
So, s starts out as 5, 4, 3, 2, 1 and 0, which means this line here is executed 6 times

00:00:40.520 --> 00:00:46.320
whereas this line down here is only executed 5 times because once s is equal to 0

00:00:46.320 --> 99:59:59.000
this line here is not executed anymore, which makes for a total of 11 time steps.
