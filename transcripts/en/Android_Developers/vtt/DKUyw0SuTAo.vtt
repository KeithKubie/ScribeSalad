00:00:00.099 --> 00:00:05.160
&gt;&gt;Reto Meier: Good afternoon and welcome to
this Friday's app clinic.

00:00:05.160 --> 00:00:13.510
My name's Reto Meier, I'm joined by Ian Ni-Lewis
and our senior executive producer, Alex Lucas.

00:00:13.510 --> 00:00:18.820
On the engineering panel we have Daniel Pham,
our NFL expert, and today we're gonna be looking

00:00:18.820 --> 00:00:20.710
at football apps.

00:00:20.710 --> 00:00:25.140
&gt;&gt;Ian Ni-Lewis: Now, if you're watching us
live, first, thanks for sticking through the

00:00:25.140 --> 00:00:31.880
completely screwed up intro that engineer
Daniel has provided us because he's usually

00:00:31.880 --> 00:00:34.370
great but not today.

00:00:34.370 --> 00:00:40.609
And second, if you have any questions for
us or any comments you wanna make during the

00:00:40.609 --> 00:00:49.719
show, engineer Alex, I'm sorry, producer,
senior vice executive producer Alex is standing

00:00:49.719 --> 00:00:50.979
by on the YouTube live stream.

00:00:50.979 --> 00:00:54.739
So he's actually watching the comments as
they go by, he's checking to make sure that

00:00:54.739 --> 00:01:03.019
we're not, you know, going all fuzzy or muted
or, you know, distorted but at the same time

00:01:03.019 --> 00:01:08.780
he can watch your comments and pass them along
to us if you say anything interesting.

00:01:08.780 --> 00:01:13.009
&gt;&gt;Reto Meier: So I'm really excited today
that you guys decided to do football.

00:01:13.009 --> 00:01:18.570
Football season is in full swing so, I've
been away from Australia for awhile so I wanted

00:01:18.570 --> 00:01:22.159
to kick off and find out exactly how the football
teams are doing.

00:01:22.159 --> 00:01:24.350
I've got this app here, Aussie Rules Live

00:01:24.350 --> 00:01:25.350
&gt;&gt;Ian Ni-Lewis: Nice.

00:01:25.350 --> 00:01:26.350
&gt;&gt;Reto Meier: which is really good.

00:01:26.350 --> 00:01:30.579
&gt;&gt;Ian Ni-Lewis: See when you said Aussie Rules
Live, I thought this was gonna be a Black

00:01:30.579 --> 00:01:31.579
Sabbath concert.

00:01:31.579 --> 00:01:33.060
&gt;&gt;Reto Meier: Interesting.

00:01:33.060 --> 00:01:34.130
Yes, no.

00:01:34.130 --> 00:01:36.329
&gt;&gt;Ian Ni-Lewis: So this is--

00:01:36.329 --> 00:01:42.770
&gt;&gt;Reto Meier: If you switch to the phone app
and the tablet for yourself.

00:01:42.770 --> 00:01:43.770
Slick.

00:01:43.770 --> 00:01:45.450
&gt;&gt;Ian Ni-Lewis: Nice.

00:01:45.450 --> 00:01:47.460
&gt;&gt;Reto Meier: Excellent.

00:01:47.460 --> 00:01:51.340
&gt;&gt;Ian Ni-Lewis: Yeah that's not really what
we had in mind.

00:01:51.340 --> 00:01:52.340
&gt;&gt;Reto Meier: No, this is pretty good.

00:01:52.340 --> 00:01:57.060
I mean, it's got some sort of iphoney styling
here and we have kind of the action bar but

00:01:57.060 --> 00:01:59.729
&gt;&gt;Ian Ni-Lewis: It's not exactly football.

00:01:59.729 --> 00:02:01.609
It has something about Australia in it.

00:02:01.609 --> 00:02:03.640
&gt;&gt;Reto Meier: Well, yeah, Australian football.

00:02:03.640 --> 00:02:06.350
That's what you guys are talking about, right?

00:02:06.350 --> 00:02:11.340
&gt;&gt;Ian Ni-Lewis: Yeah that's the thing, any
sport that can be abbreviated to something

00:02:11.340 --> 00:02:15.190
that sounds like you put it on a baby when
they go to sleep

00:02:15.190 --> 00:02:16.190
[Laughter]

00:02:16.190 --> 00:02:17.580
&gt;&gt;Reto Meier: It's not working for you?

00:02:17.580 --> 00:02:18.580
&gt;&gt;Ian Ni-Lewis: No.

00:02:18.580 --> 00:02:20.260
&gt;&gt;Reto Meier: Oh okay, sorry, it's an easy
mistake to make, right?

00:02:20.260 --> 00:02:21.260
&gt;&gt;Ian Ni-Lewis: Yeah.

00:02:21.260 --> 00:02:22.970
&gt;&gt;Reto Meier: I'm from the west coast of Australia
so football.

00:02:22.970 --> 00:02:26.670
&gt;&gt;Ian Ni-Lewis: Oh, the west coast, that explains
the whole thing.

00:02:26.670 --> 00:02:27.780
&gt;&gt;Reto Meier: It does, it does.

00:02:27.780 --> 00:02:32.880
Okay, we're not talking about Aussie Rules
so, obviously, I thought this through.

00:02:32.880 --> 00:02:35.980
So, I've got this rugby app which is great.

00:02:35.980 --> 00:02:40.550
It works, it's not quite as nice of display,
we don't have the action bar here we've kind

00:02:40.550 --> 00:02:42.350
of got the old school tabs.

00:02:42.350 --> 00:02:45.790
&gt;&gt;Ian Ni-Lewis: Yeah, not really getting it.

00:02:45.790 --> 00:02:46.920
&gt;&gt;Reto Meier: No?

00:02:46.920 --> 00:02:48.050
&gt;&gt;Ian Ni-Lewis: Who?

00:02:48.050 --> 00:02:49.050
The slippers?

00:02:49.050 --> 00:02:50.050
The blues?

00:02:50.050 --> 00:02:51.050
&gt;&gt;Reto Meier: Yeah, yeah, [cannot understand],
yeah.

00:02:51.050 --> 00:02:52.480
&gt;&gt;Ian Ni-Lewis: The hurricanes?

00:02:52.480 --> 00:02:55.550
&gt;&gt;Reto Meier: Uh, possibly.

00:02:55.550 --> 00:03:01.350
&gt;&gt;Ian Ni-Lewis: Yeah, I'm, this isn't working
for me either.

00:03:01.350 --> 00:03:02.820
&gt;&gt;Reto Meier: No?

00:03:02.820 --> 00:03:03.820
That's

00:03:03.820 --> 00:03:05.700
&gt;&gt;Ian Ni-Lewis: Daniel, are you feeling it?

00:03:05.700 --> 00:03:06.700
&gt;&gt;Daniel Pham: I have no idea what Reto is
talking about.

00:03:06.700 --> 00:03:10.250
&gt;&gt;Reto Meier: Okay, we're not talking about
Aussie Rules or Rugby.

00:03:10.250 --> 00:03:16.510
&gt;&gt;Ian Ni-Lewis: Who do you prefer War or Woofer
in the alliance stadium mat?

00:03:16.510 --> 00:03:20.820
You know, I'm glad to know it's not just in
America that we totally sell out.

00:03:20.820 --> 00:03:21.820
[Laughter]
&gt;&gt;Ian Ni-Lewis: our stadiums

00:03:21.820 --> 00:03:22.820
&gt;&gt;Reto Meier: Oh, no.

00:03:22.820 --> 00:03:24.160
&gt;&gt;Ian Ni-Lewis: Try again foreign boy.

00:03:24.160 --> 00:03:27.170
&gt;&gt;Reto Meier: Okay, so I've made a common
mistake here.

00:03:27.170 --> 00:03:30.800
I assumed that when you guys said you were
talking football that you meant this because,

00:03:30.800 --> 00:03:35.200
obviously, what a lot of people think of as
football you call soccer but I did think this

00:03:35.200 --> 00:03:38.300
through so I have some other football apps.

00:03:38.300 --> 00:03:40.050
&gt;&gt;Ian Ni-Lewis: See I knew you were gonna
try this.

00:03:40.050 --> 00:03:41.800
&gt;&gt;Reto Meier: What's that Ian?

00:03:41.800 --> 00:03:46.950
&gt;&gt;Ian Ni-Lewis: I knew you were gonna try
to pull in that whole rest of the world football

00:03:46.950 --> 00:03:47.950
thing.

00:03:47.950 --> 00:03:48.950
&gt;&gt;Reto Meier: Well we have a lot of viewers.

00:03:48.950 --> 00:03:51.270
&gt;&gt;Ian Ni-Lewis: And I know exactly why because
you know that our main, our primary audience

00:03:51.270 --> 00:03:52.270
is in Austria.

00:03:52.270 --> 00:03:53.280
&gt;&gt;Reto Meier: This is true.

00:03:53.280 --> 00:03:54.500
We have a lot of Austrian viewers.

00:03:54.500 --> 00:03:55.500
&gt;&gt;Ian Ni-Lewis: Yep.

00:03:55.500 --> 00:03:56.500
&gt;&gt;Reto Meier: Thanks for tuning in.

00:03:56.500 --> 00:03:57.500
&gt;&gt;Ian Ni-Lewis: Shout out to you guys.

00:03:57.500 --> 00:03:59.880
&gt;&gt;Reto Meier: So I don't know if we've got
the Austrian league here.

00:03:59.880 --> 00:04:04.750
I should go through cause I'm sup- well, I
think that's the Austrian flag.

00:04:04.750 --> 00:04:06.840
So there we go, so we can see, we can drill
in.

00:04:06.840 --> 00:04:11.300
The actual app itself, again, we've kind of
got this pseudo action bar with the refresh

00:04:11.300 --> 00:04:14.403
button which I know you're not a fan of, back
button which really should be--

00:04:14.403 --> 00:04:15.403
&gt;&gt;Ian Ni-Lewis: You know what?

00:04:15.403 --> 00:04:16.403
You know what?

00:04:16.403 --> 00:04:17.403
I give up, fine.

00:04:17.403 --> 00:04:18.691
[Laughter]
&gt;&gt;Ian Ni-Lewis: We're not doing your Aussie

00:04:18.691 --> 00:04:19.691
thing.

00:04:19.691 --> 00:04:20.691
[Laughter]
&gt;&gt;Ian Ni-Lewis: But I get it, okay?

00:04:20.691 --> 00:04:21.691
&gt;&gt;Reto Meier: Okay.

00:04:21.691 --> 00:04:29.260
&gt;&gt;Ian Ni-Lewis: We've go, we've got enough
non US audience here that, probably because

00:04:29.260 --> 00:04:32.850
every programmer in the US, except for you
and me, has been laid off.

00:04:32.850 --> 00:04:36.240
[Laughter]
&gt;&gt;Ian Ni-Lewis: Fine, we'll do them.

00:04:36.240 --> 00:04:39.060
I was excited; I was excited because the NFL
is starting their season.

00:04:39.060 --> 00:04:40.060
&gt;&gt;Reto Meier: Oh, the NFL.

00:04:40.060 --> 00:04:41.060
&gt;&gt;Ian Ni-Lewis: Yeah.

00:04:41.060 --> 00:04:42.060
[Laughs]

00:04:42.060 --> 00:04:43.060
&gt;&gt;Reto Meier: Oh is that

00:04:43.060 --> 00:04:44.060
&gt;&gt;Ian Ni-Lewis: You know the NFL.

00:04:44.060 --> 00:04:45.060
&gt;&gt;Reto Meier: Is the "F" for football?

00:04:45.060 --> 00:04:46.210
I didn't realize that

00:04:46.210 --> 00:04:47.210
&gt;&gt;Ian Ni-Lewis: It is.

00:04:47.210 --> 00:04:48.210
&gt;&gt;Reto Meier: You guys had a kicking game
that you were proud of.

00:04:48.210 --> 00:04:49.210
Oh, that's great.

00:04:49.210 --> 00:04:50.310
&gt;&gt;Ian Ni-Lewis: It's not just kicking, actually.

00:04:50.310 --> 00:04:55.170
There's all sorts of interaction between feet
and hands and--

00:04:55.170 --> 00:04:56.590
&gt;&gt;Reto Meier: Balls.

00:04:56.590 --> 00:04:57.590
[Laughter]

00:04:57.590 --> 00:05:03.040
&gt;&gt;Ian Ni-Lewis: So let's go ahead and take
a look at a few apps from the NFL

00:05:03.040 --> 00:05:04.040
&gt;&gt;Reto Meier: Okay, let's have a look.

00:05:04.040 --> 00:05:05.040
&gt;&gt;Ian Ni-Lewis: from the American football

00:05:05.040 --> 00:05:06.270
&gt;&gt;Reto Meier: It'll be an education.

00:05:06.270 --> 00:05:11.370
All I know about American football is from
Friday Night Lights so it should be an education.

00:05:11.370 --> 00:05:13.570
&gt;&gt;Ian Ni-Lewis: Yeah, well they play high
school rules there don't they?

00:05:13.570 --> 00:05:18.100
&gt;&gt;Reto Meier: Well they were in high school
so I would assume so.

00:05:18.100 --> 00:05:21.490
&gt;&gt;Ian Ni-Lewis: Well let's get ready for the
NFL season.

00:05:21.490 --> 00:05:25.350
I'm gonna crack open an American beer.

00:05:25.350 --> 00:05:26.350
&gt;&gt;Reto Meier: Interesting.

00:05:26.350 --> 00:05:27.350
Don't we need a, like a tailgate?

00:05:27.350 --> 00:05:30.140
Maybe a grill, is there a grill around here
somewhere?

00:05:30.140 --> 00:05:32.860
&gt;&gt;Ian Ni-Lewis: No but I've already spilled
beer on the table so I think we're off to

00:05:32.860 --> 00:05:33.860
an excellent start.

00:05:33.860 --> 00:05:36.750
&gt;&gt;Reto Meier: I think we're off to a good
start.

00:05:36.750 --> 00:05:37.750
&gt;&gt;Ian Ni-Lewis: Alright.

00:05:37.750 --> 00:05:38.800
&gt;&gt;Reto Meier: So what do you wanna start with?

00:05:38.800 --> 00:05:40.510
You guys are the NFL experts.

00:05:40.510 --> 00:05:45.700
&gt;&gt;Ian Ni-Lewis: Well, let's actually start
with one of the NFL apps.

00:05:45.700 --> 00:05:47.340
&gt;&gt;Reto Meier: Okay.

00:05:47.340 --> 00:05:49.530
&gt;&gt;Ian Ni-Lewis: That one?

00:05:49.530 --> 00:05:56.480
So, if we go over to the tablet, one of the,
one of the apps that I thought was really

00:05:56.480 --> 00:05:59.889
impressive is NFL Preseason Live.

00:05:59.889 --> 00:06:00.889
&gt;&gt;Reto Meier: Oh, nice.

00:06:00.889 --> 00:06:06.889
&gt;&gt;Ian Ni-Lewis: Now, the thing about NFL Preseason
Live, it has really terrible reviews and there's

00:06:06.889 --> 00:06:12.010
was one really good reason for that and it's
that on ICS and up, actually on Honeycomb

00:06:12.010 --> 00:06:14.950
and up, the video playback was really, really
sketchy.

00:06:14.950 --> 00:06:23.919
Now, sadly this is because previous to Honeycomb
they were actually using their own playback

00:06:23.919 --> 00:06:33.490
engine for their HTV live streaming and post
Honeycomb they went ahead and, well there

00:06:33.490 --> 00:06:38.890
you go, post Honeycomb they went ahead and
used out playback engine and it turns out

00:06:38.890 --> 00:06:41.540
that ours was a little less resilient than
theirs.

00:06:41.540 --> 00:06:49.450
They had some streams that had a little bit
of, okay so I think we're gonna need to switch

00:06:49.450 --> 00:06:53.440
to the regular camera here because as soon
as we start playing video it switches over

00:06:53.440 --> 00:06:55.340
to full screen mode.

00:06:55.340 --> 00:06:59.080
&gt;&gt;Reto Meier: You may wanna zoom out just
a touch, I think.

00:06:59.080 --> 00:07:05.651
&gt;&gt;Ian Ni-Lewis: So what they've done is they
had a few streams where the audio part of

00:07:05.651 --> 00:07:12.010
it was malformed and it crashed our decoder
and then it was unable to recover.

00:07:12.010 --> 00:07:15.570
So once we got rid of that problem everything
was okay.

00:07:15.570 --> 00:07:16.730
&gt;&gt;Reto Meier: Nice.

00:07:16.730 --> 00:07:18.370
&gt;&gt;Ian Ni-Lewis: I like the app.

00:07:18.370 --> 00:07:21.530
There's a few problems with it but the basic
concept is really cool.

00:07:21.530 --> 00:07:28.220
So, what you're getting here is start a, we
start a game, you can look at any game that's

00:07:28.220 --> 00:07:33.280
already played or I believe you can look at
them live but I haven't had the time to check

00:07:33.280 --> 00:07:37.090
it out live myself.

00:07:37.090 --> 00:07:41.780
When you-- now here's what's gonna happen
and this is the problem that we've seen in

00:07:41.780 --> 00:07:48.169
the past is we actually can't get the video
now because the, that one stream crashed it.

00:07:48.169 --> 00:07:49.169
&gt;&gt;Reto Meier: Gotcha.

00:07:49.169 --> 00:07:50.169
&gt;&gt;Ian Ni-Lewis: I kind of know

00:07:50.169 --> 00:07:51.210
&gt;&gt;Reto Meier: Once you have the crash then
you're, yeah.

00:07:51.210 --> 00:07:55.061
&gt;&gt;Ian Ni-Lewis: So, let's go ahead and just
pretend the video is playing.

00:07:55.061 --> 00:07:56.061
&gt;&gt;Reto Meier: That's probably best that it's
not there

00:07:56.061 --> 00:07:57.061
&gt;&gt;Ian Ni-Lewis: It's probably best, yeah.

00:07:57.061 --> 00:07:58.061
&gt;&gt;Reto Meier: cause the man might get--

00:07:58.061 --> 00:07:59.070
&gt;&gt;Ian Ni-Lewis: You know, we should have just
said that to begin with.

00:07:59.070 --> 00:08:00.070
&gt;&gt;Reto Meier: Yeah.

00:08:00.070 --> 00:08:01.250
&gt;&gt;Ian Ni-Lewis: We should've been like, "Oh
yeah, we blacked it out because of the man

00:08:01.250 --> 00:08:02.250
cause we're that good."

00:08:02.250 --> 00:08:03.250
&gt;&gt;Reto Meier: Exactly.

00:08:03.250 --> 00:08:04.250
It's actually well done.

00:08:04.250 --> 00:08:07.640
We can actually see the video here but I believe
it's not coming across cause Daniel is blacking

00:08:07.640 --> 00:08:08.640
it out.

00:08:08.640 --> 00:08:09.640
&gt;&gt;Ian Ni-Lewis: Right.

00:08:09.640 --> 00:08:10.640
&gt;&gt;Reto Meier: real time.

00:08:10.640 --> 00:08:11.640
&gt;&gt;Ian Ni-Lewis: Yes, exactly.

00:08:11.640 --> 00:08:12.640
Good save.

00:08:12.640 --> 00:08:17.710
Okay, so what you can see, though, is they've
actually got a whole list of all the plays

00:08:17.710 --> 00:08:19.080
that happened in the game.

00:08:19.080 --> 00:08:20.720
It's a little; it took a while to figure it
out.

00:08:20.720 --> 00:08:21.720
&gt;&gt;Reto Meier: Wow.

00:08:21.720 --> 00:08:26.600
&gt;&gt;Ian Ni-Lewis: But the orange circles basically
means there was some ball movement and then

00:08:26.600 --> 00:08:33.909
you get, I think a triangle for a turnover,
you get, if it's blue it means they scored.

00:08:33.909 --> 00:08:36.029
So like, for instance, here's the--

00:08:36.029 --> 00:08:37.029
&gt;&gt;Reto Meier: There you are.

00:08:37.029 --> 00:08:38.029
&gt;&gt;Ian Ni-Lewis: 20 yard field goal.

00:08:38.029 --> 00:08:39.029
&gt;&gt;Reto Meier: 20 yard field goal.

00:08:39.029 --> 00:08:44.209
&gt;&gt;Ian Ni-Lewis: And what's really cool about
it is you can go down here and see where the

00:08:44.209 --> 00:08:48.870
plays are that you wanna look at and then
if you click over here then it'll actually

00:08:48.870 --> 00:08:50.059
bring that up on the video.

00:08:50.059 --> 00:08:51.059
&gt;&gt;Reto Meier: Oh, nice.

00:08:51.059 --> 00:08:52.189
&gt;&gt;Ian Ni-Lewis: Yeah, it'll take you right
to it.

00:08:52.189 --> 00:08:53.490
&gt;&gt;Reto Meier: So basically like an index.

00:08:53.490 --> 00:08:54.490
&gt;&gt;Ian Ni-Lewis: Yeah.

00:08:54.490 --> 00:08:55.490
&gt;&gt;Reto Meier: For every play.

00:08:55.490 --> 00:08:56.529
&gt;&gt;Ian Ni-Lewis: Yeah and it works really well.

00:08:56.529 --> 00:08:57.529
&gt;&gt;Reto Meier: Nice.

00:08:57.529 --> 00:09:01.209
&gt;&gt;Ian Ni-Lewis: The main problem I have with
it is first, it's a little bit cryptic like

00:09:01.209 --> 00:09:04.769
there's nothing that tells you what the little
markings mean, etcetera.

00:09:04.769 --> 00:09:10.009
Second, if you can see the difference between
my quite normally sized finger and the touch

00:09:10.009 --> 00:09:11.689
target, it is a little on the small side.

00:09:11.689 --> 00:09:15.860
&gt;&gt;Reto Meier: Yeah, it's definitely not following
that 48 pixel rhythm which I'm kind of expecting.

00:09:15.860 --> 00:09:16.860
&gt;&gt;Ian Ni-Lewis: Right.

00:09:16.860 --> 00:09:17.860
Well, 48 DP.

00:09:17.860 --> 00:09:19.519
&gt;&gt;Reto Meier: 48 DP I should say.

00:09:19.519 --> 00:09:24.000
As well, I'm, does clicking anywhere do the
shortcut or do you have to specifically hit

00:09:24.000 --> 00:09:25.000
the?

00:09:25.000 --> 00:09:28.800
&gt;&gt;Ian Ni-Lewis: Actually, clicking anywhere
does as long as it has the little triangle.

00:09:28.800 --> 00:09:30.540
That means that there's an index.

00:09:30.540 --> 00:09:32.809
Now, I would probably prefer a different icon

00:09:32.809 --> 00:09:33.809
&gt;&gt;Reto Meier: Yeah.

00:09:33.809 --> 00:09:36.819
&gt;&gt;Ian Ni-Lewis: because we've always thought
that when you have a triangle pointing one

00:09:36.819 --> 00:09:43.050
way that means that you're either going to
slide and see content that's hidden over on

00:09:43.050 --> 00:09:47.990
the right or maybe the triangle's gonna turn
and you're gonna get something beneath it.

00:09:47.990 --> 00:09:55.180
There's pretty well accepted user interface
guidelines that users are gonna have expectations

00:09:55.180 --> 00:10:00.949
around, where in this case, all it does is
click and put the video on a different place,

00:10:00.949 --> 00:10:04.360
it's not even always the right place to be
perfectly honest but it's always close.

00:10:04.360 --> 00:10:08.459
&gt;&gt;Reto Meier: It feels like a pretty obvious
icon to use instead would be, in fact, a video

00:10:08.459 --> 00:10:09.750
camera or something like that.

00:10:09.750 --> 00:10:11.259
&gt;&gt;Ian Ni-Lewis: Sure.

00:10:11.259 --> 00:10:12.259
Absolutely.

00:10:12.259 --> 00:10:14.189
You know, or some sort of a bookmark icon
would be fine too.

00:10:14.189 --> 00:10:15.189
&gt;&gt;Reto Meier: That could work as well.

00:10:15.189 --> 00:10:19.139
Just some sort of indicator cause clicking
here you kind of assume that it's gonna be

00:10:19.139 --> 00:10:22.630
a drill down and you get more detail on that
particular play.

00:10:22.630 --> 00:10:25.309
The video is probably better but it's sort
of not clear.

00:10:25.309 --> 00:10:31.230
&gt;&gt;Ian Ni-Lewis: The other thing that I would
love to have is some sort of sorting ability.

00:10:31.230 --> 00:10:35.339
You can sort, for instance, on scores but
you'll notice that that removes the bookmarking

00:10:35.339 --> 00:10:36.339
functionality.

00:10:36.339 --> 00:10:37.339
&gt;&gt;Reto Meier: Oh, yeah absolutely.

00:10:37.339 --> 00:10:39.740
That's a shame cause that's kind of gonna
be the highlight that you look for.

00:10:39.740 --> 00:10:40.970
&gt;&gt;Ian Ni-Lewis: Absolutely.

00:10:40.970 --> 00:10:46.089
For me, I'm all about the passing game so
I'd really just like to see all the big passes.

00:10:46.089 --> 00:10:47.181
&gt;&gt;Reto Meier: Sure, that makes sense.

00:10:47.181 --> 00:10:50.610
&gt;&gt;Ian Ni-Lewis: I found myself, literally
for this game, sort of scrolling through and

00:10:50.610 --> 00:10:54.980
looking for like a yardage number, oh 15 yards,
maybe I wanna see that.

00:10:54.980 --> 00:10:59.459
&gt;&gt;Reto Meier: It seems like there's a lot
of information going on on this screen but

00:10:59.459 --> 00:11:03.999
what really isn't clear is exactly, like you
have to read everything in order to see anything.

00:11:03.999 --> 00:11:05.930
&gt;&gt;Ian Ni-Lewis: You know what it reminds me
of?

00:11:05.930 --> 00:11:11.910
It reminds me of trying to read the scrolling
output from like a role playing game or something,

00:11:11.910 --> 00:11:12.999
you remember those old school stuff?

00:11:12.999 --> 00:11:13.999
&gt;&gt;Reto Meier: Absolutely.

00:11:13.999 --> 00:11:14.999
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

00:11:14.999 --> 00:11:18.879
It actually reminds some, I'm a cricket fan,
I'm gonna wanna review cricket apps at some

00:11:18.879 --> 00:11:22.279
point, but it's the same sort of thing where
you have sort of constant, you know, six balls

00:11:22.279 --> 00:11:24.589
and over it's just constant, whatever happened.

00:11:24.589 --> 00:11:27.279
&gt;&gt;Ian Ni-Lewis: Now, I just wanna cut in,
Reto, and just--

00:11:27.279 --> 00:11:28.279
&gt;&gt;Reto Meier: Please do.

00:11:28.279 --> 00:11:31.529
&gt;&gt;Ian Ni-Lewis: just remind the viewers that
you have the power on this show.

00:11:31.529 --> 00:11:38.770
We do listen to reader comments or viewer
comments; we do abide, in general, by viewer

00:11:38.770 --> 00:11:43.970
votes when we're reviewing apps so you have
the power to stop the cricket madness.

00:11:43.970 --> 00:11:44.970
[Laughter]

00:11:44.970 --> 00:11:48.279
&gt;&gt;Reto Meier: Or, indeed, to force the cricket
madness if that is your inclination.

00:11:48.279 --> 00:11:49.279
&gt;&gt;Ian Ni-Lewis: Indeed.

00:11:49.279 --> 00:11:53.139
&gt;&gt;Reto Meier: So anyways, the point is that
a lot of people follow the cricket just by

00:11:53.139 --> 00:11:58.069
watching the live commentary so they've kind
of optimized that process of having the most

00:11:58.069 --> 00:11:59.329
important thing first.

00:11:59.329 --> 00:12:03.999
So the number of runs scored off each particular
ball is the first thing you see or if the

00:12:03.999 --> 00:12:07.579
person was out then that's the first thing
you see and I'd like to see the same thing

00:12:07.579 --> 00:12:08.809
here.

00:12:08.809 --> 00:12:12.350
The distance passed seems like that would
be the most important thing on a completed

00:12:12.350 --> 00:12:13.350
play.

00:12:13.350 --> 00:12:14.350
&gt;&gt;Ian Ni-Lewis: Yeah.

00:12:14.350 --> 00:12:18.319
&gt;&gt;Reto Meier: Or, in fact, scoring seems like
it should be something that should be fairly

00:12:18.319 --> 00:12:19.319
obvious.

00:12:19.319 --> 00:12:20.319
&gt;&gt;Ian Ni-Lewis: Yeah.

00:12:20.319 --> 00:12:24.059
But you can see that it feels like they actually
haven't taken a huge amount of care here because

00:12:24.059 --> 00:12:26.791
if you look at this it actually repeats some
information.

00:12:26.791 --> 00:12:30.980
This is the time on the clock and then time
on the clock is the first thing you see here

00:12:30.980 --> 00:12:31.980
as well.

00:12:31.980 --> 00:12:32.980
&gt;&gt;Reto Meier: Yeah.

00:12:32.980 --> 00:12:35.319
&gt;&gt;Ian Ni-Lewis: So I think this feels like
they're just pulling it off their news feed

00:12:35.319 --> 00:12:36.319
of some kind.

00:12:36.319 --> 00:12:37.319
&gt;&gt;Reto Meier: Yeah.

00:12:37.319 --> 00:12:41.519
&gt;&gt;Ian Ni-Lewis: At the same time, although,
it could be presented in a slightly nicer

00:12:41.519 --> 00:12:43.410
format, this is some great information.

00:12:43.410 --> 00:12:44.410
&gt;&gt;Reto Meier: Absolutely.

00:12:44.410 --> 00:12:45.410
&gt;&gt;Ian Ni-Lewis: It's a really useful app.

00:12:45.410 --> 00:12:46.410
&gt;&gt;Reto Meier: Just a presentation thing at
this point.

00:12:46.410 --> 00:12:51.269
I mean, the app itself is obviously hugely
useful to any sports fan.

00:12:51.269 --> 00:12:55.209
It's really just a case here of trying to,
you need to make this text bigger, you need

00:12:55.209 --> 00:12:59.249
to make the touch targets bigger and expand
the text cause I think all of you guys watching

00:12:59.249 --> 00:13:02.569
can see that you'd be pretty lucky if you
can read any of this from the camera.

00:13:02.569 --> 00:13:07.259
And, in fact, as soon as you sort of sit back
from it you're checking to make sure your

00:13:07.259 --> 00:13:09.569
prescription is still valid.

00:13:09.569 --> 00:13:10.569
It's small.

00:13:10.569 --> 00:13:13.180
&gt;&gt;Ian Ni-Lewis: Right and on a Nexus 7 it's
even less useful.

00:13:13.180 --> 00:13:14.180
&gt;&gt;Reto Meier: I can imagine.

00:13:14.180 --> 00:13:15.622
&gt;&gt;Ian Ni-Lewis: It's very, very difficult
to use.

00:13:15.622 --> 00:13:18.070
&gt;&gt;Reto Meier: This is a pretty big tablet
as tablets go these days.

00:13:18.070 --> 00:13:22.189
So you really wanna have that bigger and,
in fact, there's no need.

00:13:22.189 --> 00:13:27.519
Like, what they've kind of optimized here
for is to have as many plays on screen at

00:13:27.519 --> 00:13:30.100
a time and that's probably not what you wanna
optimize for, right?

00:13:30.100 --> 00:13:31.639
&gt;&gt;Ian Ni-Lewis: Yeah, I think you're right.

00:13:31.639 --> 00:13:37.009
I think that rather than seeing a huge number
of plays where I have to carefully read each

00:13:37.009 --> 00:13:42.709
one, I'd rather have the information presented
so that I can scan it so quickly that flicking

00:13:42.709 --> 00:13:45.009
this up and down will actually be useful.

00:13:45.009 --> 00:13:46.089
&gt;&gt;Reto Meier: Yes, absolutely.

00:13:46.089 --> 00:13:49.839
&gt;&gt;Ian Ni-Lewis: So if I see, and you can see
they've done a little bit like I can flick

00:13:49.839 --> 00:13:55.720
this up and down and when I see this little
blue-ish green color go by, even if it's moving

00:13:55.720 --> 00:13:59.459
very fast, I can see that because it stands
out from the rest of everything.

00:13:59.459 --> 00:14:00.459
&gt;&gt;Reto Meier: Yeah, absolutely.

00:14:00.459 --> 00:14:01.779
&gt;&gt;Ian Ni-Lewis: So bravo on that count.

00:14:01.779 --> 00:14:07.170
Now, take that idea and extend it out to the
rest of this particular UI and I think you've

00:14:07.170 --> 00:14:08.170
got a real winner.

00:14:08.170 --> 00:14:11.750
&gt;&gt;Reto Meier: And, in fact, what I would say
is you've actually got the right idea here.

00:14:11.750 --> 00:14:15.920
So if we look over here on this side you can
actually see that they've got this rich and

00:14:15.920 --> 00:14:17.269
large touch targets.

00:14:17.269 --> 00:14:21.339
That's probably about the size you want and
the same way that they've got their sort of

00:14:21.339 --> 00:14:24.920
background bleed image, that'd be kind of
cool even having this done here, right?

00:14:24.920 --> 00:14:30.439
So you could have the same UI element over
on this side with a beak, you know, rather

00:14:30.439 --> 00:14:34.600
than having a sort of small logo, you have
that background effect, bigger text, more

00:14:34.600 --> 00:14:36.149
dramatic, you know, view.

00:14:36.149 --> 00:14:40.720
Particularly here cause we've got light gray
on slightly darker gray, if you're supposed

00:14:40.720 --> 00:14:44.910
to be able to read it make it stand out, put
it in bold, make it bright white against black,

00:14:44.910 --> 00:14:45.910
you know, whatever you like.

00:14:45.910 --> 00:14:48.709
But I would say something like this over on
this side so you can actually read it.

00:14:48.709 --> 00:14:50.160
&gt;&gt;Ian Ni-Lewis: Yeah, over on the left is
great isn't it?

00:14:50.160 --> 00:14:51.160
&gt;&gt;Reto Meier: That looks fantastic.

00:14:51.160 --> 00:14:52.160
&gt;&gt;Ian Ni-Lewis: Yeah, it's just beautiful.

00:14:52.160 --> 00:14:53.160
I'm really impressed.

00:14:53.160 --> 00:14:59.879
So, I think, I just wanna say one more thing
about this app and that's about the top of

00:14:59.879 --> 00:15:00.879
the app.

00:15:00.879 --> 00:15:01.879
&gt;&gt;Reto Meier: Yeah, absolutely.

00:15:01.879 --> 00:15:02.879
&gt;&gt;Ian Ni-Lewis: Go ahead.

00:15:02.879 --> 00:15:03.879
&gt;&gt;Reto Meier: No, no, please.

00:15:03.879 --> 00:15:04.879
&gt;&gt;Ian Ni-Lewis: Oh, no I was just feeding
you lines.

00:15:04.879 --> 00:15:05.879
[Laughter]
&gt;&gt;Ian Ni-Lewis: I was feeding them and you're

00:15:05.879 --> 00:15:06.879
running.

00:15:06.879 --> 00:15:07.879
&gt;&gt;Reto Meier: I like this, yeah.

00:15:07.879 --> 00:15:09.279
I need a blocker.

00:15:09.279 --> 00:15:15.230
So we've kind of got this, it's not an action
bar it's a title bar and it's kind of all

00:15:15.230 --> 00:15:16.230
wrong, right?

00:15:16.230 --> 00:15:17.230
I mean, this is a--

00:15:17.230 --> 00:15:18.230
&gt;&gt;Daniel Pham: Hang out.

00:15:18.230 --> 00:15:21.380
&gt;&gt;Ian Ni-Lewis: Oh man, all of a sudden I'm
being Dan Galpin.

00:15:21.380 --> 00:15:24.019
Yeah, I gotta watch the content monitor.

00:15:24.019 --> 00:15:25.019
[Laughter]

00:15:25.019 --> 00:15:29.009
&gt;&gt;Reto Meier: So, this at the top and even
here where you're looking at the sort of almost

00:15:29.009 --> 00:15:34.179
tabs, turn them into actual tabs so that I
stop having to do scare quotes and this title

00:15:34.179 --> 00:15:35.790
bar should really be an action bar.

00:15:35.790 --> 00:15:41.759
So things like settings, if I hit this, so,
yeah.

00:15:41.759 --> 00:15:42.759
&gt;&gt;Ian Ni-Lewis: Yeah.

00:15:42.759 --> 00:15:44.549
&gt;&gt;Reto Meier: I don't even know where to start.

00:15:44.549 --> 00:15:48.579
So this should all be in an overflow menu
and it shouldn't be this weird dropdown popup

00:15:48.579 --> 00:15:50.859
thing it should just be a standard menu affordance.

00:15:50.859 --> 00:15:55.359
Now, as far as I know, this is a tablet app,
an app for tablets only, is that right?

00:15:55.359 --> 00:15:56.359
&gt;&gt;Ian Ni-Lewis: Right.

00:15:56.359 --> 00:15:59.420
&gt;&gt;Reto Meier: Okay, so you don't actually
have an excuse not to use the action bar because

00:15:59.420 --> 00:16:02.480
you don't have to worry about backwards compatibility,
you don't have to worry about how your menu

00:16:02.480 --> 00:16:06.129
is gonna work on other devices, you just make
it an action bar.

00:16:06.129 --> 00:16:10.749
So this, all of this stuff, it's fair enough
to have, to put this in settings but settings

00:16:10.749 --> 00:16:13.120
should kind of always be in the overflow menu.

00:16:13.120 --> 00:16:16.350
I'm not quite sure what the question mark
is gonna do.

00:16:16.350 --> 00:16:17.670
Oh, hello.

00:16:17.670 --> 00:16:19.179
So it's like on screen tips.

00:16:19.179 --> 00:16:20.920
That's actually not bad.

00:16:20.920 --> 00:16:24.369
I don't know that I'd make it a primary action,
again, I'd probably stick that into an overflow

00:16:24.369 --> 00:16:27.350
menu and maybe display this the first time
the app came up.

00:16:27.350 --> 00:16:28.519
I don't know

00:16:28.519 --> 00:16:33.360
&gt;&gt;Ian Ni-Lewis: I will say that, in general,
if you find that it's necessary to show something

00:16:33.360 --> 00:16:38.369
like this it is probably a good clue telling
you that you're--

00:16:38.369 --> 00:16:40.290
&gt;&gt;Reto Meier: A little too complex.

00:16:40.290 --> 00:16:41.579
&gt;&gt;Ian Ni-Lewis: not doing a good UI.

00:16:41.579 --> 00:16:43.319
&gt;&gt;Reto Meier: Things should be as intuitive
as possible.

00:16:43.319 --> 00:16:46.839
You know, you shouldn't have to explain to
users how things work, you should just be

00:16:46.839 --> 00:16:52.100
able to plop this down in front of someone
who understands NFL and they're able to start

00:16:52.100 --> 00:16:54.089
getting involved in the app.

00:16:54.089 --> 00:16:58.239
In fact, when we do sort of internal reviews
for apps, we find the ones which we like the

00:16:58.239 --> 00:17:02.119
best are the ones where rather than everyone
sitting down and everyone sort of nit picking

00:17:02.119 --> 00:17:07.250
which pixel should be a different color, we're
all sort of using the app and sort of getting

00:17:07.250 --> 00:17:08.250
involved in that.

00:17:08.250 --> 00:17:11.100
I'm sure it's a similar experience when you
guys have done games reviews as well.

00:17:11.100 --> 00:17:12.100
&gt;&gt;Ian Ni-Lewis: Absolutely.

00:17:12.100 --> 00:17:13.100
&gt;&gt;Reto Meier: That's what you want.

00:17:13.100 --> 00:17:15.799
You want it so that people aren't going, "Oh
wait, how did you get to that screen?

00:17:15.799 --> 00:17:16.900
What did you do just there?"

00:17:16.900 --> 00:17:21.000
It's just like I'm too busy getting engaged
in apps like this there's so much content.

00:17:21.000 --> 00:17:23.510
&gt;&gt;Ian Ni-Lewis: You really need to do some
user testing.

00:17:23.510 --> 00:17:29.720
Sit down with somebody, not, and I can't emphasize
this enough, don't sit down with some random

00:17:29.720 --> 00:17:35.210
guy who is probably carrying a blackberry
or an Iphone, sit down with someone who's

00:17:35.210 --> 00:17:38.710
used to using an Android tablet, you know,
sit down with somebody who's actually your

00:17:38.710 --> 00:17:42.510
target market for an Android application and
watch them use it.

00:17:42.510 --> 00:17:47.710
If they start swiping their finger across
things that are unswipable and getting frustrated,

00:17:47.710 --> 00:17:48.710
that's your first clue.

00:17:48.710 --> 00:17:49.809
&gt;&gt;Reto Meier: That's a sign.

00:17:49.809 --> 00:17:53.360
In fact, I saw a little tip, so we can slide
here so that's quite nice.

00:17:53.360 --> 00:17:56.070
So you can slide between weeks, yeah, 3 week
season.

00:17:56.070 --> 00:17:58.980
&gt;&gt;Ian Ni-Lewis: Yeah, the only thing I don't
really like about it is that I think that

00:17:58.980 --> 00:18:03.420
it's not obvious enough where you're at.

00:18:03.420 --> 00:18:09.250
Like, if you look at most of the view pagers
that we've put out, they have some sort of

00:18:09.250 --> 00:18:11.270
indication of where you are, it's either the
little dots like you see on a home screen

00:18:11.270 --> 00:18:12.530
&gt;&gt;Reto Meier: Absolutely.

00:18:12.530 --> 00:18:16.360
&gt;&gt;Ian Ni-Lewis: Or it's a tabs or something
like that.

00:18:16.360 --> 00:18:18.909
&gt;&gt;Reto Meier: Yeah, particularly because it
gives you that indication of where the, you

00:18:18.909 --> 00:18:22.159
know, how far along you are and obviously
on this side, it's obvious that there isn't

00:18:22.159 --> 00:18:26.100
anything before, well there is, and that's
interesting so.

00:18:26.100 --> 00:18:27.490
&gt;&gt;Ian Ni-Lewis: Well it's wrapping around.

00:18:27.490 --> 00:18:31.130
&gt;&gt;Reto Meier: It is and particularly so I'm
at pre week 1 and it seems intuitive that

00:18:31.130 --> 00:18:33.510
there isn't anything before the first pre
week but there is.

00:18:33.510 --> 00:18:38.330
You know, if, you've got the hall of fame
and then we're back to pre week 4 which is,

00:18:38.330 --> 00:18:40.519
again, kind of funny how we're doing a wrap
around.

00:18:40.519 --> 00:18:41.519
I don't know that you wanna do that.

00:18:41.519 --> 00:18:43.929
&gt;&gt;Ian Ni-Lewis: I don't know that I would
have made that choice but whatever.

00:18:43.929 --> 00:18:44.929
&gt;&gt;Reto Meier: It's a call.

00:18:44.929 --> 00:18:49.630
&gt;&gt;Ian Ni-Lewis: It's valid it's just not,
now here I'll tell you what I'm gonna do.

00:18:49.630 --> 00:18:50.630
&gt;&gt;Reto Meier: You gonna clean up the beer?

00:18:50.630 --> 00:18:56.200
&gt;&gt;Ian Ni-Lewis: I'm gonna sacrifice my Android
camp hoody to save your Google lab coat.

00:18:56.200 --> 00:18:58.130
&gt;&gt;Reto Meier: My lab coat, It seems like the
lab coat should be the--

00:18:58.130 --> 00:19:00.130
&gt;&gt;Ian Ni-Lewis: God knows they're not making
any more of them.

00:19:00.130 --> 00:19:01.130
[Laughter]

00:19:01.130 --> 00:19:02.769
&gt;&gt;Reto Meier: True enough.

00:19:02.769 --> 00:19:06.970
So the other thing I'd point out as well is,
I mean, this is a pretty fast device and this

00:19:06.970 --> 00:19:08.730
scrolling is not the smoothest.

00:19:08.730 --> 00:19:13.419
So there might be something you can do there
to optimize that scroll speed.

00:19:13.419 --> 00:19:18.330
Anything which makes the app feel a little
janky really distracts from the user experience

00:19:18.330 --> 00:19:22.059
so, you know, when you are designing things,
everything should be as smooth as it possibly

00:19:22.059 --> 00:19:23.059
can be.

00:19:23.059 --> 00:19:30.049
&gt;&gt;Ian Ni-Lewis: Yeah, and this is, a lot of
times what we see if people are either using

00:19:30.049 --> 00:19:34.250
a regular view inefficiently or they're using
a web view to do some of this.

00:19:34.250 --> 00:19:41.360
The other thing that's actually, a good tip
for many devices, but not all, which also

00:19:41.360 --> 00:19:45.860
happens to line up nicely with our design
guidelines is if you put a little less emphasis

00:19:45.860 --> 00:19:51.929
on the gradients here, especially if that's
something the you're adding in after that

00:19:51.929 --> 00:19:52.929
fact.

00:19:52.929 --> 00:19:59.830
In general, most Android apps and the Android
UI tries to be from simplified and flat, we

00:19:59.830 --> 00:20:01.250
don't go for the bubbly look.

00:20:01.250 --> 00:20:02.250
&gt;&gt;Reto Meier: Yeah.

00:20:02.250 --> 00:20:07.100
&gt;&gt;Ian Ni-Lewis: And there are devices in the
field that, possibly because of that, are

00:20:07.100 --> 00:20:09.090
not actually very good at drawing gradients.

00:20:09.090 --> 00:20:10.559
&gt;&gt;Reto Meier: This is true.

00:20:10.559 --> 00:20:14.540
I did an experiment, myself, with a compass
app and just, you know, if you do it flat

00:20:14.540 --> 00:20:19.679
it renders really quickly, if I put like a
gloss top on top of it, everything slows down.

00:20:19.679 --> 00:20:24.530
&gt;&gt;Ian Ni-Lewis: Well, you gotta remember that
anytime you're drawing like a gradient or

00:20:24.530 --> 00:20:31.300
a glassy look or anything like that you're
touching the pixels twice as often and, in

00:20:31.300 --> 00:20:35.950
many cases, devices are fill bound and that
literally does make it half as fast.

00:20:35.950 --> 00:20:37.100
&gt;&gt;Reto Meier: There you go.

00:20:37.100 --> 00:20:41.059
So the only other thing we've got here, so
we've got these tabs, these should probably

00:20:41.059 --> 00:20:46.580
be actual tabs rather than these weird pseudo
tabs and, again, basically this is the idea

00:20:46.580 --> 00:20:52.799
of the text being difficult to pause easily,
being small and not of high contrast is something

00:20:52.799 --> 00:20:53.799
you probably wanna look at throughout.

00:20:53.799 --> 00:20:54.940
Alright, shall we move on?

00:20:54.940 --> 00:20:56.500
&gt;&gt;Ian Ni-Lewis: Yes, let's do so.

00:20:56.500 --> 00:20:58.309
&gt;&gt;Reto Meier: Alright, let's have a look.

00:20:58.309 --> 00:21:06.520
&gt;&gt;Ian Ni-Lewis: Alright, well, I think that
the top rated apps this week by viewers were

00:21:06.520 --> 00:21:07.520
actually the--

00:21:07.520 --> 00:21:08.520
&gt;&gt;Reto Meier: The football apps.

00:21:08.520 --> 00:21:09.920
&gt;&gt;Ian Ni-Lewis: The football apps.

00:21:09.920 --> 00:21:11.909
&gt;&gt;Reto Meier: The soccer apps?

00:21:11.909 --> 00:21:15.019
&gt;&gt;Ian Ni-Lewis: Yes, the football with a round
ball app.

00:21:15.019 --> 00:21:16.039
&gt;&gt;Reto Meier: Excellent.

00:21:16.039 --> 00:21:20.940
And, in fact, I think, no there's international
rules for football also uses a round ball,

00:21:20.940 --> 00:21:24.659
I was gonna say soccer was the only one which
does but it's not quite true.

00:21:24.659 --> 00:21:29.830
Alright, let's have a look at FotMob Pro which
I think is one of the top, one of the top

00:21:29.830 --> 00:21:31.150
resulting ones.

00:21:31.150 --> 00:21:33.490
Trying to go back to the home screen.

00:21:33.490 --> 00:21:38.730
So look at this straight away, so this is
a popular app and I would suggest that one

00:21:38.730 --> 00:21:41.110
of the main reasons for that is that it's
very useful.

00:21:41.110 --> 00:21:45.659
You can get all the soccer scores from basically
whichever league you're watching including

00:21:45.659 --> 00:21:46.840
the major league soccer.

00:21:46.840 --> 00:21:53.360
&gt;&gt;Ian Ni-Lewis: Oh good, let's see if my favorite
team Real Salt Lake is in there.

00:21:53.360 --> 00:21:55.681
[Laughter]
&gt;&gt;Ian Ni-Lewis: Apparently not.

00:21:55.681 --> 00:21:56.681
&gt;&gt;Reto Meier: Apparently not.

00:21:56.681 --> 00:21:59.559
So that's one thing to be concerned of straight
away is that I'm not entirely sure what this

00:21:59.559 --> 00:22:02.610
icon represents but clicking it should take
you to something.

00:22:02.610 --> 00:22:07.620
I kind of assumed it would be rankings which
makes sense, the very fact that it didn't

00:22:07.620 --> 00:22:11.530
appear for the MLS suggests that we're pulling
this down--

00:22:11.530 --> 00:22:12.530
&gt;&gt;Ian Ni-Lewis: American soccer sucks?

00:22:12.530 --> 00:22:13.850
&gt;&gt;Reto Meier: Could be, it could be.

00:22:13.850 --> 00:22:16.919
&gt;&gt;Ian Ni-Lewis: I don't actually mean that,
of course American soccer is the greatest

00:22:16.919 --> 00:22:17.919
just like anything American.

00:22:17.919 --> 00:22:18.919
[Laughter]
&gt;&gt;Ian Ni-Lewis: compared to most Australian

00:22:18.919 --> 00:22:20.910
things is what I'm saying.

00:22:20.910 --> 00:22:22.520
&gt;&gt;Reto Meier: Oh, nice.

00:22:22.520 --> 00:22:24.549
&gt;&gt;Ian Ni-Lewis: Austrian, of course,

00:22:24.549 --> 00:22:27.399
&gt;&gt;Reto Meier: Let's pick on the Australians
we're all asleep right now.

00:22:27.399 --> 00:22:28.399
&gt;&gt;Ian Ni-Lewis: Let's do that.

00:22:28.399 --> 00:22:29.399
[Laughter]

00:22:29.399 --> 00:22:30.630
&gt;&gt;Reto Meier: It seems reasonable enough.

00:22:30.630 --> 00:22:34.880
&gt;&gt;Ian Ni-Lewis: Alright, so yeah, I don't
know why that's not showing up but it would

00:22:34.880 --> 00:22:35.880
be nice to have something.

00:22:35.880 --> 00:22:38.610
&gt;Reto Meier: I think it's just failing to
pull down the data so I think you wanna have

00:22:38.610 --> 00:22:39.750
some sort of indication here that it's loading.

00:22:39.750 --> 00:22:40.750
&gt;&gt;Ian Ni-Lewis: Right.

00:22:40.750 --> 00:22:43.750
&gt;&gt;Reto Meier: Now I'm not a big fan of loading
dialogues or anything like that but there

00:22:43.750 --> 00:22:48.470
should be some indication that, "Hey, I'm
trying to pull down data" and if it fails,

00:22:48.470 --> 00:22:51.480
saying, "I tried to but for whatever reason
I can't get the information."

00:22:51.480 --> 00:22:56.279
&gt;&gt;Ian Ni-Lewis: Now, I will say that the iconography
in this interface is a little puzzling to

00:22:56.279 --> 00:23:00.340
me and you're gonna have to, you know, just
check me on this because, obviously, you know,

00:23:00.340 --> 00:23:02.320
I don't actually follow soccer.

00:23:02.320 --> 00:23:03.659
&gt;&gt;Reto Meier: Sure.

00:23:03.659 --> 00:23:10.279
&gt;&gt;Ian Ni-Lewis: Maybe this is all totally
old hat to you but I see this thing here and

00:23:10.279 --> 00:23:13.559
I think maybe it looks like a list, I don't
know.

00:23:13.559 --> 00:23:18.519
And apparently I don't know what I did there.

00:23:18.519 --> 00:23:19.519
&gt;&gt;Reto Meier: It's the funky touch targets.

00:23:19.519 --> 00:23:23.580
&gt;&gt;Ian Ni-Lewis: And then apparently this baby
over here that it, to me, it looked like a,

00:23:23.580 --> 00:23:25.549
what I would call, soccer ball but that's
exactly

00:23:25.549 --> 00:23:26.549
&gt;&gt;Reto Meier: I was gonna say Mickey Mouse.

00:23:26.549 --> 00:23:27.600
&gt;&gt;Ian Ni-Lewis: Apparently that's the top
scores.

00:23:27.600 --> 00:23:28.799
&gt;&gt;Reto Meier: Interesting.

00:23:28.799 --> 00:23:31.790
So that wouldn't have been obvious to me either.

00:23:31.790 --> 00:23:32.790
&gt;&gt;Ian Ni-Lewis: Really, yeah.

00:23:32.790 --> 00:23:33.790
&gt;&gt;Reto Meier: Yeah, definitely not.

00:23:33.790 --> 00:23:37.559
I would have thought maybe the opposite, like
the top scores would have been a person or

00:23:37.559 --> 00:23:41.480
maybe even a person kicking or maybe even
a goal, I don't know, there's a few options

00:23:41.480 --> 00:23:42.480
there.

00:23:42.480 --> 00:23:44.399
Definitely the iconography needs work.

00:23:44.399 --> 00:23:48.510
The idea of having the action bar here is
reasonable but, again, I would go with a more

00:23:48.510 --> 00:23:51.610
standard up affordance other than this pseudo
back button.

00:23:51.610 --> 00:23:53.570
It's confusing, is it an up button?

00:23:53.570 --> 00:23:54.570
Is it a back button?

00:23:54.570 --> 00:23:56.539
Is it different from the back button down
at the bottom?

00:23:56.539 --> 00:23:57.539
&gt;&gt;Ian Ni-Lewis: Yeah.

00:23:57.539 --> 00:23:58.620
&gt;&gt;Reto Meier: It's not quite right.

00:23:58.620 --> 00:24:03.279
&gt;&gt;Ian Ni-Lewis: Yeah it's a different, you
know, long time viewers of the show know that

00:24:03.279 --> 00:24:10.639
I've never been completely comfortable with
the idea that something pointing to the left

00:24:10.639 --> 00:24:11.840
is actually taking me up

00:24:11.840 --> 00:24:15.980
&gt;&gt;Reto Meier: That's because this is an affordance,
you see, rather than just a button.

00:24:15.980 --> 00:24:16.980
&gt;&gt;Ian Ni-Lewis: Right.

00:24:16.980 --> 00:24:22.541
Exactly and an affordance sounds like something
you live in if you're on a fixed income.

00:24:22.541 --> 00:24:23.541
[Laughter]

00:24:23.541 --> 00:24:24.541
&gt;&gt;Reto Meier: It really does.

00:24:24.541 --> 00:24:25.541
[Laughter]

00:24:25.541 --> 00:24:33.140
&gt;&gt;Ian Ni-Lewis: So, but the point is that,
that, that space is, as of Honeycomb, reserved

00:24:33.140 --> 00:24:38.379
for something that will take you to the previous
point in the view hierarchy of the application

00:24:38.379 --> 00:24:42.179
as opposed to the previous screen that you
were on before which is what the system back

00:24:42.179 --> 00:24:43.179
button is for.

00:24:43.179 --> 00:24:44.179
&gt;&gt;Reto Meier: Exactly.

00:24:44.179 --> 00:24:49.919
&gt;&gt;Ian Ni-Lewis: And the general iconography
for that is that it should have something,

00:24:49.919 --> 00:24:54.600
akin to your application icon, in general
that's the, like with a left chevron.

00:24:54.600 --> 00:24:56.200
&gt;&gt;Reto Meier: Exactly.

00:24:56.200 --> 00:25:02.130
&gt;&gt;Ian Ni-Lewis: In this case we've bounced
between what that looks like a back button

00:25:02.130 --> 00:25:03.919
and what that looks like a down button.

00:25:03.919 --> 00:25:08.460
&gt;&gt;Reto Meier: So I guess this is an attempt
at an overflow menu but on the wrong side.

00:25:08.460 --> 00:25:09.460
&gt;&gt;Ian Ni-Lewis: You think?

00:25:09.460 --> 00:25:12.080
&gt;&gt;Reto Meier: Well, we're choosing leagues
so it's kind of settings here at this point.

00:25:12.080 --> 00:25:13.929
&gt;&gt;Ian Ni-Lewis: Okay, but that's the only
thing, right?

00:25:13.929 --> 00:25:16.330
It's not like choose leagues and a bunch of
other stuff.

00:25:16.330 --> 00:25:17.929
&gt;&gt;Reto Meier: That's true, that's true.

00:25:17.929 --> 00:25:21.970
So either way I think you wanna redesign this
into something more like an action bar.

00:25:21.970 --> 00:25:27.460
So once you go into the app you've got some
kind of iconography on the top saying what

00:25:27.460 --> 00:25:28.460
the app is

00:25:28.460 --> 00:25:30.779
&gt;&gt;Ian Ni-Lewis: Now see, of course, like all
good Android users I'm swiping

00:25:30.779 --> 00:25:31.779
&gt;&gt;Reto Meier: You are swiping.

00:25:31.779 --> 00:25:34.899
&gt;&gt;Ian Ni-Lewis: There's a really good reason
for people to swipe, first, in Android tabs

00:25:34.899 --> 00:25:37.260
go on top, as you can see they've already
violated.

00:25:37.260 --> 00:25:38.490
&gt;&gt;Reto Meier: Yeah.

00:25:38.490 --> 00:25:43.779
&gt;&gt;Ian Ni-Lewis: And, of course, that makes
one thumb navigation more difficult which

00:25:43.779 --> 00:25:45.259
we solved by adding the swipe action.

00:25:45.259 --> 00:25:46.259
&gt;&gt;Reto Meier: Absolutely.

00:25:46.259 --> 00:25:49.950
&gt;&gt;Ian Ni-Lewis: So even though that might
feel a little bit like an Ambrose Bierce short

00:25:49.950 --> 00:25:53.970
story, yeah, I ruined that by not even saying
it right.

00:25:53.970 --> 00:25:55.070
&gt;&gt;Reto Meier: Yeah.

00:25:55.070 --> 00:25:57.279
It was almost really good.

00:25:57.279 --> 00:26:01.429
&gt;&gt;Ian Ni-Lewis: Yeah, could've been.

00:26:01.429 --> 00:26:05.669
You are, you end up having, having to move
your thumb all around, you know, I wanna get

00:26:05.669 --> 00:26:08.580
to tomorrow, why can't I get to tomorrow by
swiping?

00:26:08.580 --> 00:26:09.580
&gt;&gt;Reto Meier: Swiping to tomorrow.

00:26:09.580 --> 00:26:10.990
&gt;&gt;Ian Ni-Lewis: It seems like the normal thing,
right?

00:26:10.990 --> 00:26:11.990
&gt;&gt;Reto Meier: Absolutely.

00:26:11.990 --> 00:26:15.649
So you wanna eliminate these and replace them
with something which is more like a view pager

00:26:15.649 --> 00:26:17.870
type set up, straight away.

00:26:17.870 --> 00:26:23.630
Move this into an action bar which is on the
top right, get rid of this whole, wow, let's

00:26:23.630 --> 00:26:28.480
have a look here, get rid of this whole sort
of down chevron button for choosing leagues.

00:26:28.480 --> 00:26:32.320
If it's something you want users to do then
make it an action, if it's something they

00:26:32.320 --> 00:26:35.940
should be able to do but don't wanna do very
often then it should probably sit under settings

00:26:35.940 --> 00:26:39.840
in the overflow menu, but either way it sort
of looks really weird.

00:26:39.840 --> 00:26:46.450
I do recognize it as a glyph that we used
to use in a version of Android at some point.

00:26:46.450 --> 00:26:48.029
I vaguely remember back from Cupcake.

00:26:48.029 --> 00:26:49.350
&gt;&gt;Ian Ni-Lewis: You're absolutely right.

00:26:49.350 --> 00:26:54.919
Yeah, it was back in the, right, in the Cupcake
and Eclair days back when we didn't have any

00:26:54.919 --> 00:26:58.169
designers and we were basically just stealing
our art off the internet.

00:26:58.169 --> 00:26:59.950
&gt;&gt;Reto Meier: Just making it up as we went
along.

00:26:59.950 --> 00:27:00.950
&gt;&gt;Ian Ni-Lewis: Pretty much, yeah.

00:27:00.950 --> 00:27:01.950
&gt;&gt;Reto Meier: Sad.

00:27:01.950 --> 00:27:03.120
&gt;&gt;Ian Ni-Lewis: None of that stuff looked
good.

00:27:03.120 --> 00:27:04.610
I'm just gonna call that right now.

00:27:04.610 --> 00:27:07.539
&gt;&gt;Reto Meier: It really didn't and that's
the beauty of the new stuff is that it really

00:27:07.539 --> 00:27:08.539
does.

00:27:08.539 --> 00:27:10.809
We've got an incredible design team now which
have really spent a lot of time and effort

00:27:10.809 --> 00:27:13.080
thinking about how to make stuff look awesome.

00:27:13.080 --> 00:27:15.899
So when you can, take advantage of that.

00:27:15.899 --> 00:27:20.770
We see the same thing here as we saw in the
previous app where you've got really small

00:27:20.770 --> 00:27:25.440
touch targets and really small text and, again,
like we're looking at the league here, there's

00:27:25.440 --> 00:27:27.679
no reason why we can't scroll more if we have
to.

00:27:27.679 --> 00:27:30.530
&gt;&gt;Ian Ni-Lewis: See this is what I love about
American soccer, by the way.

00:27:30.530 --> 00:27:35.190
We got Real Salt Lake which I just can't laugh
enough about.

00:27:35.190 --> 00:27:37.390
&gt;&gt;Reto Meier: I can't even bring myself to
even say that.

00:27:37.390 --> 00:27:38.960
To me, there has to be a real salt lake.

00:27:38.960 --> 00:27:45.040
&gt;&gt;Ian Ni-Lewis: What about this CD Chivas
USA, what does that even mean?

00:27:45.040 --> 00:27:52.571
Is it boned by the Scotch Company or is there
something called a Chiva of which this is

00:27:52.571 --> 00:27:53.571
the plural?

00:27:53.571 --> 00:27:54.571
&gt;&gt;Reto Meier: It could be.

00:27:54.571 --> 00:27:55.571
They are the Chivas.

00:27:55.571 --> 00:27:58.499
&gt;&gt;Ian Ni-Lewis: Do we have anyone, producer
Alex; do we have anyone on YouTube that knows

00:27:58.499 --> 00:27:59.750
the answer to this mystery?

00:27:59.750 --> 00:28:01.000
&gt;&gt;Alex Lucas: Nobody's commenting.

00:28:01.000 --> 00:28:02.240
&gt;&gt;Reto Meier: If anyone--

00:28:02.240 --> 00:28:04.740
&gt;&gt;Ian Ni-Lewis: I'm sorry, nobody's commenting
at all?

00:28:04.740 --> 00:28:07.159
&gt;&gt;Alex Lucas: I'm sorry; nobody's answering
your question.

00:28:07.159 --> 00:28:08.159
&gt;&gt;Ian Ni-Lewis: Oh, okay.

00:28:08.159 --> 00:28:09.409
Are they saying stuff about us?

00:28:09.409 --> 00:28:11.059
&gt;&gt;Alex Lucas: Not really, no.

00:28:11.059 --> 00:28:12.059
&gt;&gt;Ian Ni-Lewis: Darn.

00:28:12.059 --> 00:28:13.539
&gt;&gt;Reto Meier: Is anyone watching?

00:28:13.539 --> 00:28:14.539
Hello?

00:28:14.539 --> 00:28:15.539
&gt;&gt;Ian Ni-Lewis: Right, yeah.

00:28:15.539 --> 00:28:16.539
&gt;&gt;Reto Meier: Is this thing on?

00:28:16.539 --> 00:28:17.539
&gt;&gt;Alex Lucas: 41 people are watching.

00:28:17.539 --> 00:28:18.539
&gt;&gt;Ian Ni-Lewis: Nice.

00:28:18.539 --> 00:28:19.539
Hey guys.

00:28:19.539 --> 00:28:20.679
[Laughter]
&gt;&gt;Ian Ni-Lewis: Also, how do you like my haircut?

00:28:20.679 --> 00:28:22.130
Did you notice I got a football haircut?

00:28:22.130 --> 00:28:23.130
&gt;&gt;Reto Meier: True story.

00:28:23.130 --> 00:28:26.039
&gt;&gt;Ian Ni-Lewis: And I got a football grin,
too.

00:28:26.039 --> 00:28:27.039
[Growls]

00:28:27.039 --> 00:28:28.559
&gt;&gt;Reto Meier: Terrifying.

00:28:28.559 --> 00:28:31.720
So, yeah, I don't know.

00:28:31.720 --> 00:28:35.679
I was trying to figure out what the story
was between, behind CD Chivas earlier today

00:28:35.679 --> 00:28:38.179
and I could not, for the life of me, figure
it out.

00:28:38.179 --> 00:28:40.649
I don't even know where they play.

00:28:40.649 --> 00:28:42.240
I don't know, it's a mystery.

00:28:42.240 --> 00:28:48.720
The good news is that, the San Jose Earthquakes
which is, I guess, our local team.

00:28:48.720 --> 00:28:49.720
&gt;&gt;Ian Ni-Lewis: Oh yeah?

00:28:49.720 --> 00:28:51.129
&gt;&gt;Reto Meier: Is leading the Western league.

00:28:51.129 --> 00:28:52.129
&gt;&gt;Ian Ni-Lewis: Awesome.

00:28:52.129 --> 00:28:53.549
Yeah, right down there in San Jose.

00:28:53.549 --> 00:28:54.549
&gt;&gt;Reto Meier: Absolutely.

00:28:54.549 --> 00:28:57.659
&gt;&gt;Ian Ni-Lewis: By all the used car dealerships
and the check cashing places.

00:28:57.659 --> 00:28:58.659
&gt;&gt;Reto Meier: Sweet.

00:28:58.659 --> 00:28:59.659
Go Earthquakes.

00:28:59.659 --> 00:29:03.190
&gt;&gt;Ian Ni-Lewis: Paycheck cashing places are
San Jose's second largest business.

00:29:03.190 --> 00:29:04.190
&gt;&gt;Reto Meier: Is that right?

00:29:04.190 --> 00:29:05.190
&gt;&gt;Ian Ni-Lewis: Yeah.

00:29:05.190 --> 00:29:06.190
&gt;&gt;Reto Meier: What's it's top business?

00:29:06.190 --> 00:29:07.240
Is that safe for work?

00:29:07.240 --> 00:29:08.240
&gt;&gt;Ian Ni-Lewis: I think it's Adobe.

00:29:08.240 --> 00:29:10.860
&gt;&gt;Reto Meier: Oh, that'll do it, yeah.

00:29:10.860 --> 00:29:14.419
[Laughter]
&gt;&gt;Reto Meier: So yeah, there you go and this

00:29:14.419 --> 00:29:15.419
is the problem, right?

00:29:15.419 --> 00:29:20.950
This is a really good tip, if you find that
your users are exiting the app unexpectedly

00:29:20.950 --> 00:29:22.519
then your navigation is broken.

00:29:22.519 --> 00:29:27.299
And that's the thing we see most frequently,
where people are using mult-- like you've

00:29:27.299 --> 00:29:31.740
got multiple tabs here and so you're jumping
around and you're choosing different things

00:29:31.740 --> 00:29:34.289
and then you get back to here and you've pressed
a bunch of buttons.

00:29:34.289 --> 00:29:35.879
&gt;&gt;Ian Ni-Lewis: I want to go back to where
I was.

00:29:35.879 --> 00:29:37.750
&gt;&gt;Reto Meier: And you can't quite remember
where you started.

00:29:37.750 --> 00:29:41.580
It's like, well I wanna go back to just to
list of things and so I, oh wait, no that

00:29:41.580 --> 00:29:42.900
wasn't it.

00:29:42.900 --> 00:29:47.780
&gt;&gt;Ian Ni-Lewis: Although, it's somewhat telling
that I wasn't disappointed in the application

00:29:47.780 --> 00:29:48.780
result.

00:29:48.780 --> 00:29:50.070
[Laughter]
&gt;&gt;Ian Ni-Lewis: Actually kind of a problem

00:29:50.070 --> 00:29:56.929
with sports apps in general, we just had a
talk on Thursday, internally, about some sports

00:29:56.929 --> 00:30:03.419
apps and one of the things that I think we
all agreed on is that these are incredibly

00:30:03.419 --> 00:30:08.460
challenging because they have to present a
gargantuan amount of information.

00:30:08.460 --> 00:30:13.740
I mean, sports, if you think about just how
much information needs to be presented in

00:30:13.740 --> 00:30:18.059
all of the different ways you can slice it
and dice it, it is a serious UI challenge.

00:30:18.059 --> 00:30:19.059
&gt;&gt;Reto Meier: Absolutely.

00:30:19.059 --> 00:30:24.659
&gt;&gt;Ian Ni-Lewis: But that's a great reason
to really think this through and to always

00:30:24.659 --> 00:30:30.179
follow Android UI guidelines because the more
you can make it like all other Android apps,

00:30:30.179 --> 00:30:35.669
the more you can make consistent UI decisions
that people are gonna expect, the more useable

00:30:35.669 --> 00:30:40.000
your apps gonna be and you have to target
useability because you have so much to present

00:30:40.000 --> 00:30:42.700
that your app, out of the gate, is already
confusing.

00:30:42.700 --> 00:30:43.700
&gt;&gt;Reto Meier: Absolutely.

00:30:43.700 --> 00:30:46.399
I mean, anything which is so rich in data
runs that risk.

00:30:46.399 --> 00:30:49.539
So it's really, the navigation is probably
your biggest challenge.

00:30:49.539 --> 00:30:52.090
Otherwise, the app itself is pretty good.

00:30:52.090 --> 00:30:56.309
I mean, you've got your stats, you've got
your scores, you know, all this sort of stuff

00:30:56.309 --> 00:31:01.019
really the key here is that this whole app
just kind of needs a navigation refresh and

00:31:01.019 --> 00:31:06.399
a UI refresh, something to bring it up to
standard with sort of your ICS type imagery

00:31:06.399 --> 00:31:07.399
and layouts.

00:31:07.399 --> 00:31:13.750
&gt;&gt;Ian Ni-Lewis: And I'm just gonna make one
other comment on the, you know, the gradients

00:31:13.750 --> 00:31:16.880
here, uh, I don't like that.

00:31:16.880 --> 00:31:21.529
I think it's unnecessary and the thing is,
I'm a big fan gradients, I think gradients

00:31:21.529 --> 00:31:27.080
can look really incredible and a lot of times
they're much better than a flat screen but

00:31:27.080 --> 00:31:32.260
A, they are a little bit tired right now,
they're sort of, they've been done.

00:31:32.260 --> 00:31:35.970
&gt;&gt;Reto Meier: They're kind of the lens flare
of the 10's.

00:31:35.970 --> 00:31:37.880
&gt;&gt;Ian Ni-Lewis: Right.

00:31:37.880 --> 00:31:41.519
But more than that, gradients look good in
isolation.

00:31:41.519 --> 00:31:46.419
When you stack a bunch on top of each other
like this then the eye starts picking up this

00:31:46.419 --> 00:31:49.049
pattern and it ends up looking kind of cheesy.

00:31:49.049 --> 00:31:51.269
&gt;&gt;Reto Meier: It does, it really does.

00:31:51.269 --> 00:31:55.159
If you're not gonna have them sort of, you
know, flowing between different colors like

00:31:55.159 --> 00:32:00.210
some sort of old school like jukebox type
scenario then, yeah, it's just gonna be distracting

00:32:00.210 --> 00:32:01.210
instead.

00:32:01.210 --> 00:32:02.210
&gt;&gt;Ian Ni-Lewis: Right.

00:32:02.210 --> 00:32:05.980
So, in fact, if you look at some of the things
we've done with gradients that I think were

00:32:05.980 --> 00:32:13.970
very attractive, we've done things like, take
a list and then put a continuous gradient

00:32:13.970 --> 00:32:17.379
all the way down the screen behind it.

00:32:17.379 --> 00:32:18.379
That's also fairly expensive.

00:32:18.379 --> 00:32:19.379
&gt;&gt;Reto Meier: Absolutely.

00:32:19.379 --> 00:32:22.009
&gt;&gt;Ian Ni-Lewis: That's not easy to do and
not all devices can handle it but it looks

00:32:22.009 --> 00:32:23.009
fantastic.

00:32:23.009 --> 00:32:24.920
Whereas, just stacking these up like this
is

00:32:24.920 --> 00:32:26.740
&gt;&gt;Reto Meier: Yeah, it's a waste.

00:32:26.740 --> 00:32:29.070
&gt;&gt;Alex Lucas: We have a couple questions on
the screen, actually.

00:32:29.070 --> 00:32:30.070
&gt;&gt;Ian Ni-Lewis: Awesome.

00:32:30.070 --> 00:32:31.070
&gt;&gt;Reto Meier: Yes, please.

00:32:31.070 --> 00:32:32.980
&gt;&gt;Ian Ni-Lewis: We'd love to answer some live
questions.

00:32:32.980 --> 00:32:36.399
&gt;&gt;Alex Lucas: First, Gerald Smith asks, "Overflow
menu, what does he mean by that?"

00:32:36.399 --> 00:32:39.730
If you could describe what, go into a little
more detail about what you're referring to

00:32:39.730 --> 00:32:40.830
when you say the overflow menu.

00:32:40.830 --> 00:32:45.909
&gt;&gt;Reto Meier: Absolutely, so the overflow
menu is the extra menu options that you see

00:32:45.909 --> 00:32:51.139
on the action bar when, let's have a look;
we'll fire up, what's a good app for the overflow

00:32:51.139 --> 00:32:52.139
menu?

00:32:52.139 --> 00:32:53.139
&gt;&gt;Ian Ni-Lewis: Playstore.

00:32:53.139 --> 00:32:54.139
&gt;&gt;Reto Meier: We'll go with the Playstore.

00:32:54.139 --> 00:32:55.139
&gt;&gt;Ian Ni-Lewis: It has an overflow menu.

00:32:55.139 --> 00:32:56.139
There you go.

00:32:56.139 --> 00:32:57.139
&gt;&gt;Reto Meier: So this is the overflow menu.

00:32:57.139 --> 00:32:59.429
Let's try and just get to the standard action
bar if we can.

00:32:59.429 --> 00:33:05.340
So here is your typical actions and then everything
just behind that menu bar is the overflow

00:33:05.340 --> 00:33:06.340
menu.

00:33:06.340 --> 00:33:10.200
So that's where you wanna put things which
users need to get to but they're probably

00:33:10.200 --> 00:33:12.080
not the most important things.

00:33:12.080 --> 00:33:16.010
So, settings, anything like about, account
information, you know, the sorts of things

00:33:16.010 --> 00:33:19.490
they have here are perfect examples of what
you wanna put in the overflow.

00:33:19.490 --> 00:33:25.179
&gt;&gt;Ian Ni-Lewis: Exactly and it's worth mentioning
that the overflow contents can actually change;

00:33:25.179 --> 00:33:27.200
now in this case they haven't.

00:33:27.200 --> 00:33:31.749
But there are apps where, given a little more
horizontal space, you'd actually see more

00:33:31.749 --> 00:33:37.510
action icons over here on the right and then
the overflow menu would have fewer options

00:33:37.510 --> 00:33:38.510
in it, Gmail, for instance.

00:33:38.510 --> 00:33:39.510
&gt;&gt;Reto Meier: Yeah, Gmail is a good one.

00:33:39.510 --> 00:33:44.409
&gt;&gt;Ian Ni-Lewis: In general, what you wanna
do is think of your action bar as having two

00:33:44.409 --> 00:33:48.970
essential pieces, you know, one over the left
you've got the navigation piece and that is

00:33:48.970 --> 00:33:56.149
split into your up affordance, in this case,
as we talked about the left chevron, the icon

00:33:56.149 --> 00:34:01.830
and usually some indication of where you're
at, in this case it's our search results,

00:34:01.830 --> 00:34:02.830
NFL.

00:34:02.830 --> 00:34:05.530
And then potentially another navigational
piece like a dropdown.

00:34:05.530 --> 00:34:06.530
&gt;&gt;Reto Meier: Yeah.

00:34:06.530 --> 00:34:11.120
&gt;&gt;Ian Ni-Lewis: And then over on the right,
you've got the second major portion of your

00:34:11.120 --> 00:34:15.320
action bar which is the action piece and that's
gonna be a set of icons.

00:34:15.320 --> 00:34:21.000
If, if you want you can put text here as well,
although that's usually not quite as effective,

00:34:21.000 --> 00:34:24.430
it certainly takes up more horizontal space,
and then the overflow.

00:34:24.430 --> 00:34:31.400
Now you'll also see, on some devices, on some
apps, a menu that looks like the overflow

00:34:31.400 --> 00:34:33.580
menu down here in the corner.

00:34:33.580 --> 00:34:35.440
Now we call that the menu button of shame.

00:34:35.440 --> 00:34:36.440
&gt;&gt;Reto Meier: Yeah.

00:34:36.440 --> 00:34:40.130
&gt;&gt;Ian Ni-Lewis: And the reason is the only
time you see that menu button is when you

00:34:40.130 --> 00:34:46.270
haven't updated your app for an SDK, a target
SDK that's greater than Honeycomb.

00:34:46.270 --> 00:34:47.270
&gt;&gt;Reto Meier: Absolutely.

00:34:47.270 --> 00:34:49.540
And then most, see this is the proper one
of shame.

00:34:49.540 --> 00:34:55.340
So there's two versions of this, there's the
unfortunate version where you've got an app

00:34:55.340 --> 00:34:59.590
and you haven't updated it yet so you haven't
figured out how your pre existing menu is

00:34:59.590 --> 00:35:03.010
going to work with an action bar.

00:35:03.010 --> 00:35:05.420
So that takes a little bit of thought so that's
not good.

00:35:05.420 --> 00:35:08.990
But what this is is the real, the real button
of shame.

00:35:08.990 --> 00:35:10.750
Which is here and it does absolutely nothing.

00:35:10.750 --> 00:35:14.070
So all you do is change your target SDK and
that will go away.

00:35:14.070 --> 00:35:19.520
&gt;&gt;Ian Ni-Lewis: You know, the worst thing
is on some devices with custom UIs having

00:35:19.520 --> 00:35:24.000
that button there will actually do a bunch
of layout changes.

00:35:24.000 --> 00:35:25.000
&gt;&gt;Reto Meier: Oh, wow.

00:35:25.000 --> 00:35:28.730
&gt;&gt;Ian Ni-Lewis: It'll actually put the menu
button over top of the system buttons.

00:35:28.730 --> 00:35:29.730
&gt;&gt;Reto Meier: Nice.

00:35:29.730 --> 00:35:32.060
&gt;&gt;Ian Ni-Lewis: So having that be empty is
extremely unfortunate.

00:35:32.060 --> 00:35:33.900
[Laughter]
&gt;&gt;Ian Ni-Lewis: Now you're just taken up screen

00:35:33.900 --> 00:35:36.010
real estate for absolutely no reason at all.

00:35:36.010 --> 00:35:37.290
&gt;&gt;Reto Meier: No.

00:35:37.290 --> 00:35:38.290
Nice.

00:35:38.290 --> 00:35:39.730
Okay, was there another question, Alex?

00:35:39.730 --> 00:35:40.860
&gt;&gt;Alex Lucas: Yeah, Gerald says thanks.

00:35:40.860 --> 00:35:41.860
&gt;&gt;Reto Meier: No worries, Gerald.

00:35:41.860 --> 00:35:46.650
&gt;&gt;Alex Lucas: The next question is from a
Ross Larson who says, "Can we talk about app

00:35:46.650 --> 00:35:47.650
permissions here?

00:35:47.650 --> 00:35:52.220
I couldn't install this year's version of
the NFL draft tracker app because my app,

00:35:52.220 --> 00:35:54.270
because my device didn't have an onboard GPS."

00:35:54.270 --> 00:35:59.670
&gt;&gt;Ian Ni-Lewis: Oh, you know, it's, we would
love to talk about app-- in fact we should

00:35:59.670 --> 00:36:01.680
do a complete show on app permissions.

00:36:01.680 --> 00:36:02.680
&gt;&gt;Reto Meier: I think we will.

00:36:02.680 --> 00:36:04.720
I think we'll do an app, an office hours on
permissions.

00:36:04.720 --> 00:36:07.910
&gt;&gt;Ian Ni-Lewis: Right, but the problem is
we don't have a show called the Friday rant.

00:36:07.910 --> 00:36:09.040
&gt;&gt;Reto Meier: That's true.

00:36:09.040 --> 00:36:10.040
The Friday rage.

00:36:10.040 --> 00:36:13.000
&gt;&gt;Ian Ni-Lewis: And we still haven't got permission
to utter pornography and use profanity.

00:36:13.000 --> 00:36:15.600
&gt;&gt;Alex Lucas: You're on for an hour a week,
dude, that's the feat.

00:36:15.600 --> 00:36:17.090
&gt;&gt;Reto Meier: Utter pornography, that's interesting.

00:36:17.090 --> 00:36:20.150
&gt;&gt;Ian Ni-Lewis: It's pornography and profanity
involved with permissions.

00:36:20.150 --> 00:36:21.150
&gt;&gt;Reto Meier: And profanity, that would be
quite a show.

00:36:21.150 --> 00:36:22.150
[Laughter]

00:36:22.150 --> 00:36:26.660
&gt;&gt;Ian Ni-Lewis: Although I'm not 100 percent
that he's asking for permission, there's also

00:36:26.660 --> 00:36:27.810
features that come into play here.

00:36:27.810 --> 00:36:33.440
&gt;&gt;Reto Meier: I think that's, this is the
issue is that if you request certain permissions,

00:36:33.440 --> 00:36:38.410
then for legacy reasons that implies a feature
requirement as well and GPS is one of those

00:36:38.410 --> 00:36:44.280
if you request a find or course locator, well,
no, if you request find location then the

00:36:44.280 --> 00:36:49.390
system will imply that, well, actually, you're
probably meant to require a GPS as well.

00:36:49.390 --> 00:36:54.020
&gt;&gt;Ian Ni-Lewis: Yeah, so, you're absolutely
right, you know, being unable to install that

00:36:54.020 --> 00:36:58.220
on a system that doesn't have a GPS is an
indication that the app has done something

00:36:58.220 --> 00:37:00.570
that we consider to be sketchy.

00:37:00.570 --> 00:37:08.030
First, they haven't made it so you can have
an optional permission or an optional feature

00:37:08.030 --> 00:37:16.720
but, more importantly, they're requiring find
location which is unusual and almost always

00:37:16.720 --> 00:37:21.320
indicates that they have an ad network that's
attempting to track you at an inappropriate

00:37:21.320 --> 00:37:22.320
level.

00:37:22.320 --> 00:37:23.320
&gt;&gt;Reto Meier: Yeah, this is true.

00:37:23.320 --> 00:37:25.350
I mean, obviously it's gonna depend on the
app and you're gonna have to figure out based

00:37:25.350 --> 00:37:30.820
on, you know, what they offer if that makes
sense and I suspect if it's anything that's

00:37:30.820 --> 00:37:34.320
displaying video, they may be using the find
location to figure out where you are to make

00:37:34.320 --> 00:37:36.320
sure they have the rights to show you that
video in that location.

00:37:36.320 --> 00:37:38.120
&gt;&gt;Ian Ni-Lewis: Course location would do that
as well, right?

00:37:38.120 --> 00:37:43.020
&gt;&gt;Reto Meier: It should be at the very least
city, you know, accurate to a city level which

00:37:43.020 --> 00:37:44.630
definitely should be sufficient for anything
like rights management.

00:37:44.630 --> 00:37:49.250
&gt;&gt;Ian Ni-Lewis: The thing too is if you are
doing that then that's, that's totally insecure

00:37:49.250 --> 00:37:51.810
because you're just trusting the client to
say where it's at, that could be hijacked

00:37:51.810 --> 00:37:52.810
so easily.

00:37:52.810 --> 00:37:53.810
So I think most video services would be--

00:37:53.810 --> 00:37:55.080
&gt;&gt;Reto Meier: A little more clever.

00:37:55.080 --> 00:37:59.290
&gt;&gt;Ian Ni-Lewis: In general, they'll do IP
filtering which is easy to spoof as well but

00:37:59.290 --> 00:38:00.290
more costly.

00:38:00.290 --> 00:38:01.290
&gt;&gt;Reto Meier: Yeah.

00:38:01.290 --> 00:38:04.240
Okay, so, for developers out there wondering
how you can get around this, you can simply

00:38:04.240 --> 00:38:11.250
specify a user's feature and specify location
as a required false which effectively makes

00:38:11.250 --> 00:38:12.250
it optional.

00:38:12.250 --> 00:38:15.900
Then, within your app you'll need to check
to see whether or not there is a GPS or some

00:38:15.900 --> 00:38:20.280
form of location sensing hardware available
before you make those location update requests.

00:38:20.280 --> 00:38:23.790
&gt;&gt;Ian Ni-Lewis: And consider that, not just
for GPS, but for other things that you may

00:38:23.790 --> 00:38:24.790
or may not find.

00:38:24.790 --> 00:38:26.160
For instance, a back facing camera.

00:38:26.160 --> 00:38:27.160
&gt;&gt;Reto Meier: That's a good one, yeah.

00:38:27.160 --> 00:38:30.620
&gt;&gt;Ian Ni-Lewis: Yeah, if you ask for a camera,
well, several devices, and the most important

00:38:30.620 --> 00:38:35.501
one to us being the Nexus 7, do not have rear
facing cameras and the rear facing camera

00:38:35.501 --> 00:38:38.060
is what you get if you say you need a camera.

00:38:38.060 --> 00:38:39.340
I think that's a little confusing, honestly.

00:38:39.340 --> 00:38:43.250
&gt;&gt;Reto Meier: It can be but it's one of those
legacy type deals where, you know, when we

00:38:43.250 --> 00:38:48.250
put in the user's feature and permission for
a camera, it was only rear facing camera.

00:38:48.250 --> 00:38:49.250
So, yeah.

00:38:49.250 --> 00:38:53.870
&gt;&gt;Ian Ni-Lewis: In general, I think the rule
of thumb is don't ask for a feature or permission

00:38:53.870 --> 00:38:55.410
unless you're app depends on it.

00:38:55.410 --> 00:38:56.410
&gt;&gt;Reto Meier: Absolutely.

00:38:56.410 --> 00:39:00.490
&gt;&gt;Ian Ni-Lewis: If that's what your app is
all about, if all your app does is take photos,

00:39:00.490 --> 00:39:03.610
then by all means say that a camera is required.

00:39:03.610 --> 00:39:09.620
But, if your app has any other functionality,
for instance, viewing sets of photos or applying

00:39:09.620 --> 00:39:15.000
filter effects to your photos, then don't
require a camera because people might want

00:39:15.000 --> 00:39:18.790
to do that with a set that they've uploaded
to Google Plus or that things that they've

00:39:18.790 --> 00:39:19.960
downloaded from their camera or whatever.

00:39:19.960 --> 00:39:23.630
&gt;&gt;Reto Meier: Cause keep in mind, for those
users, Nexus 7 users aren't going to be outraged

00:39:23.630 --> 00:39:27.860
to find out they can't take photos with your
photo taking app given that they have a device

00:39:27.860 --> 00:39:28.860
without a camera.

00:39:28.860 --> 00:39:30.120
&gt;&gt;Ian Ni-Lewis: They'll figure that out.

00:39:30.120 --> 00:39:33.390
&gt;&gt;Reto Meier: They'll, exactly, they'll know
what to expect.

00:39:33.390 --> 00:39:35.900
So you wanna give them as much as they can
so they can still do, you know, the other

00:39:35.900 --> 00:39:36.900
things.

00:39:36.900 --> 00:39:41.290
&gt;&gt;Ian Ni-Lewis: Okay, now, I'm just gonna
say we've covered a grand total of 2 apps.

00:39:41.290 --> 00:39:42.290
&gt;&gt;Reto Meier: We've done well.

00:39:42.290 --> 00:39:45.161
&gt;&gt;Ian Ni-Lewis: And engineer Daniel is over
there going like this.

00:39:45.161 --> 00:39:46.161
&gt;&gt;Reto Meier: Going, I'm gonna have no time
to set up this next show.

00:39:46.161 --> 00:39:50.630
&gt;&gt;Ian Ni-Lewis: Because engineer Daniel thinks
that he is the producer of the show.

00:39:50.630 --> 00:39:51.630
But--

00:39:51.630 --> 00:39:55.360
&gt;&gt;Reto Meier: That's because engineer, because
engineer Daniel is gonna be on the next show,

00:39:55.360 --> 00:39:56.360
right?

00:39:56.360 --> 00:39:59.210
So he just doesn't wanna have his time in
the sun curtailed by us going over.

00:39:59.210 --> 00:40:00.210
&gt;&gt;Ian Ni-Lewis: That's true.

00:40:00.210 --> 00:40:01.210
That is very true.

00:40:01.210 --> 00:40:02.540
&gt;&gt;Reto Meier: We're on to you, Daniel.

00:40:02.540 --> 00:40:09.130
&gt;&gt;Ian Ni-Lewis: The truth is, I think we've
looked at what most of the apps in this category

00:40:09.130 --> 00:40:12.110
do, you know, pretty deeply.

00:40:12.110 --> 00:40:16.470
Feature wise and in terms of the mistake that
we've seen people make, so why don't we just

00:40:16.470 --> 00:40:20.370
really quickly, do a lightening round, we
have DFB.

00:40:20.370 --> 00:40:25.650
&gt;&gt;Reto Meier: I think all the sort of sports
updates, news and scores I think are all gonna

00:40:25.650 --> 00:40:27.100
be pretty much along the same lines.

00:40:27.100 --> 00:40:29.660
Did you wanna have; did you wanna spend a
couple of minutes looking at any of the fantasy

00:40:29.660 --> 00:40:30.660
football apps?

00:40:30.660 --> 00:40:31.950
&gt;&gt;Ian Ni-Lewis: I think we better not.

00:40:31.950 --> 00:40:37.380
I think, we talked, we looked at the one app
that had some things we didn't like about

00:40:37.380 --> 00:40:40.560
it and I think it'd be fair to look at some
of these other apps because I think they do

00:40:40.560 --> 00:40:41.900
things better or worse.

00:40:41.900 --> 00:40:47.290
For instance, DFB, despite the fact that it's
completely in German, I found myself liking

00:40:47.290 --> 00:40:48.290
it a lot.

00:40:48.290 --> 00:40:50.200
&gt;&gt;Reto Meier: It's just got a much more conventional
style here.

00:40:50.200 --> 00:40:54.690
We've got a normal action bar with a normal
layout, navigation on the left, swipable view

00:40:54.690 --> 00:40:56.290
pager, it looks really nice.

00:40:56.290 --> 00:41:01.050
&gt;&gt;Ian Ni-Lewis: Yeah, it makes me; it makes
me feel like I'm reading a sports page.

00:41:01.050 --> 00:41:02.050
&gt;&gt;Reto Meier: Yes.

00:41:02.050 --> 00:41:04.761
This is a key and this is, again, something
we discussed internally, It's like, the thing

00:41:04.761 --> 00:41:10.570
about any sports news information is that
imagery is really important to that and so

00:41:10.570 --> 00:41:15.210
we watch sports for the imagery it contains
and so you wanna have something which is like

00:41:15.210 --> 00:41:20.390
reading a magazine, lots of images, lots of
video, lots of full bleed content so that

00:41:20.390 --> 00:41:25.940
you sort of, swiping through looking at stuff
and getting seen what catches your eye, that's

00:41:25.940 --> 00:41:26.940
really powerful.

00:41:26.940 --> 00:41:30.880
&gt;&gt;Ian Ni-Lewis: In fact, the only thing that
I would love to see is for these pictures

00:41:30.880 --> 00:41:33.180
here to actually be larger.

00:41:33.180 --> 00:41:34.180
&gt;&gt;Reto Meier: Absolutely.

00:41:34.180 --> 00:41:38.500
&gt;&gt;Ian Ni-Lewis: Now we've complained some
about apps that put text over images when

00:41:38.500 --> 00:41:43.110
that's inappropriate especially for social
apps, for instance, that have images that

00:41:43.110 --> 00:41:44.450
are user created, you never know exactly what
you're gonna get.

00:41:44.450 --> 00:41:45.450
&gt;&gt;Reto Meier: Absolutely.

00:41:45.450 --> 00:41:49.660
&gt;&gt;Ian Ni-Lewis: but in this case you do and
it's almost always appropriate to bleed this

00:41:49.660 --> 00:41:51.040
through just the way they've done here.

00:41:51.040 --> 00:41:52.040
&gt;&gt;Reto Meier: Exactly.

00:41:52.040 --> 00:41:55.690
The way that you've got it here on the title,
if it was just all of the items in that list

00:41:55.690 --> 00:41:56.960
done the same way, I think that would look
fantastic.

00:41:56.960 --> 00:41:58.080
&gt;&gt;Ian Ni-Lewis: Now do you see?

00:41:58.080 --> 00:42:00.510
It just synced and the sync icon rotated.

00:42:00.510 --> 00:42:01.510
&gt;&gt;Reto Meier: Automatically.

00:42:01.510 --> 00:42:02.510
&gt;&gt;Ian Ni-Lewis: Beautiful.

00:42:02.510 --> 00:42:03.510
&gt;&gt;Reto Meier: Very nice.

00:42:03.510 --> 00:42:04.510
&gt;&gt;Ian Ni-Lewis: Very nice.

00:42:04.510 --> 00:42:05.510
I don't know what this is.

00:42:05.510 --> 00:42:06.510
[Laughter]

00:42:06.510 --> 00:42:07.510
&gt;&gt;Reto Meier: Nothing good.

00:42:07.510 --> 00:42:08.510
&gt;&gt;Ian Ni-Lewis: Apparently it's the crash
button.

00:42:08.510 --> 00:42:09.510
&gt;&gt;Reto Meier: It's the, yeah, the quick exit
button.

00:42:09.510 --> 00:42:12.880
&gt;&gt;Ian Ni-Lewis: But you can see they've done
exactly what we ask in action bar.

00:42:12.880 --> 00:42:13.880
&gt;&gt;Reto Meier: Perfect.

00:42:13.880 --> 00:42:16.870
&gt;&gt;Ian Ni-Lewis: Which means I know exactly
how to use this application.

00:42:16.870 --> 00:42:21.240
I know that I'm gonna see actions up here,
I know if I wanna share it's gonna be there,

00:42:21.240 --> 00:42:23.390
I'm guessing this is gonna make the text bigger
or smaller, that's nice.

00:42:23.390 --> 00:42:24.390
&gt;&gt;Reto Meier: That makes sense.

00:42:24.390 --> 00:42:26.400
&gt;&gt;Ian Ni-Lewis: If I wanna save this for later
what am I gonna do?

00:42:26.400 --> 00:42:28.100
&gt;&gt;Reto Meier: You're gonna hit the star, right?

00:42:28.100 --> 00:42:29.100
&gt;&gt;Ian Ni-Lewis: Absolutely.

00:42:29.100 --> 00:42:30.100
Star button.

00:42:30.100 --> 00:42:32.560
&gt;&gt;Reto Meier: It's kind of the wrong color
but that's okay and it probably wants to be

00:42:32.560 --> 00:42:34.350
offset a little bit so it doesn't tip the
edges.

00:42:34.350 --> 00:42:35.820
&gt;&gt;Ian Ni-Lewis: It's probably one of those
European star buttons.

00:42:35.820 --> 00:42:37.470
&gt;&gt;Reto Meier: But, you know, I'm nit picking
at this point.

00:42:37.470 --> 00:42:38.470
&gt;&gt;Ian Ni-Lewis: Everything's different over
there.

00:42:38.470 --> 00:42:40.910
&gt;&gt;Reto Meier: The other thing I'd also, you've
got some crashing issues.

00:42:40.910 --> 00:42:44.910
&gt;&gt;Ian Ni-Lewis: Yeah and the up affordance
is a little different.

00:42:44.910 --> 00:42:46.680
&gt;&gt;Reto Meier: It's a little sketchy, yeah.

00:42:46.680 --> 00:42:47.700
It's not quite right.

00:42:47.700 --> 00:42:52.350
The other thing I'd point out as well is we
have this mixture of icon style.

00:42:52.350 --> 00:42:56.670
So, you can see here that we're presumably
using the system built in icons for refresh

00:42:56.670 --> 00:43:00.840
and share but the ones that these guys have
built themselves are slightly different colors.

00:43:00.840 --> 00:43:05.200
I don't know if this comes across on the video
but these are gray and the custom ones here

00:43:05.200 --> 00:43:06.200
are white.

00:43:06.200 --> 00:43:07.200
&gt;&gt;Ian Ni-Lewis: It's really tough to get right.

00:43:07.200 --> 00:43:08.200
&gt;&gt;Reto Meier: It is hard to get right.

00:43:08.200 --> 00:43:11.790
But it's worth doing and it's also worth doing
them all yourself so rather than depending

00:43:11.790 --> 00:43:16.070
on the system to provide some, use the system
provided ones, I believe they're available

00:43:16.070 --> 00:43:21.600
for download from developer.Android.com/design
these days and so you, this way you don't

00:43:21.600 --> 00:43:24.660
have to worry about the system changing any
of them on a different implementation.

00:43:24.660 --> 00:43:27.870
&gt;&gt;Ian Ni-Lewis: Although hopefully that won't
happen nearly as much anymore.

00:43:27.870 --> 00:43:28.970
&gt;&gt;Reto Meier: Indeed, indeed.

00:43:28.970 --> 00:43:32.230
&gt;&gt;Ian Ni-Lewis: Particularly with different
manufacturers putting skins on their devices,

00:43:32.230 --> 00:43:34.960
you never know for certain, what icons they're
gonna provide.

00:43:34.960 --> 00:43:36.780
So by providing them yourself you have that
security.

00:43:36.780 --> 00:43:40.150
&gt;&gt;Ian Ni-Lewis: Okay, and just really quickly,
I think the last thing we were gonna look

00:43:40.150 --> 00:43:41.760
at was the live score thing.

00:43:41.760 --> 00:43:44.400
See, loading countries, right there, my American
sensibility is--

00:43:44.400 --> 00:43:46.540
&gt;&gt;Reto Meier: Yeah, it's out the window.

00:43:46.540 --> 00:43:48.170
&gt;&gt;Ian Ni-Lewis: Yeah.

00:43:48.170 --> 00:43:53.150
&gt;&gt;Reto Meier: See, quick set up should be
done automatically.

00:43:53.150 --> 00:43:58.400
So, again, you don't wanna have to go through
and do all this the first time, you just wanna

00:43:58.400 --> 00:44:00.750
jump straight in to whatever you think is
the most obvious.

00:44:00.750 --> 00:44:05.070
Now, whether that's choosing countries based
on the current location using course location

00:44:05.070 --> 00:44:09.640
to get an idea or just picking the countries
which most people use, all those sorts of

00:44:09.640 --> 00:44:13.360
things are gonna provide a better experience
if you can get started straight away.

00:44:13.360 --> 00:44:14.530
&gt;&gt;Ian Ni-Lewis: Yeah, absolutely.

00:44:14.530 --> 00:44:18.050
So of course I'm gonna follow Real Salt Lake.

00:44:18.050 --> 00:44:19.330
[Laughter]

00:44:19.330 --> 00:44:27.240
&gt;&gt;Ian Ni-Lewis: Okay, so, in general, this
has some good stuff going for it.

00:44:27.240 --> 00:44:31.320
It's got the, it's obviously syncing or something
but it's showing me something while it's syncing.

00:44:31.320 --> 00:44:33.470
&gt;&gt;Reto Meier: You get done straight away and
that's really important.

00:44:33.470 --> 00:44:37.790
&gt;&gt;Ian Ni-Lewis: Yeah and it's a really pretty,
I love the color.

00:44:37.790 --> 00:44:38.790
&gt;&gt;Reto Meier: It's really nice.

00:44:38.790 --> 00:44:39.930
Again, the text is really, really small.

00:44:39.930 --> 00:44:40.930
&gt;&gt;Ian Ni-Lewis: It's a little small.

00:44:40.930 --> 00:44:44.090
&gt;&gt;Reto Meier: I think this is a common problem
for people who are going, "We have so much

00:44:44.090 --> 00:44:46.280
data, how do we display it all at once?"

00:44:46.280 --> 00:44:47.880
Well, you don't have to display it at once.

00:44:47.880 --> 00:44:48.880
&gt;&gt;Ian Ni-Lewis: Right.

00:44:48.880 --> 00:44:51.740
&gt;&gt;Reto Meier: Better to have fewer things
on screen and let people do a flick scroll

00:44:51.740 --> 00:44:52.740
or a left, right scroll.

00:44:52.740 --> 00:44:56.180
&gt;&gt;Ian Ni-Lewis: The very last thing I wanna
mention is although this looks like an action

00:44:56.180 --> 00:44:57.450
bar, it's not.

00:44:57.450 --> 00:45:01.910
It doesn't act the way an action bar does,
it doesn't have an up affordance, it doesn't

00:45:01.910 --> 00:45:08.460
have actions on the right, it's got navigation
here but one of the navigation things is more

00:45:08.460 --> 00:45:10.720
which does not include, it's not just navigation.

00:45:10.720 --> 00:45:15.540
&gt;&gt;Reto Meier: And, in fact, this is really,
most of this stuff should belong in the overflow

00:45:15.540 --> 00:45:16.540
menu.

00:45:16.540 --> 00:45:17.540
&gt;&gt;Ian Ni-Lewis: Exactly.

00:45:17.540 --> 00:45:23.610
So, you might wanna think about actually just
moving to a standard Android action bar or

00:45:23.610 --> 00:45:27.150
if that just doesn't suit your sensibility
maybe moving to a drawer pattern or something

00:45:27.150 --> 00:45:28.150
like that.

00:45:28.150 --> 00:45:29.150
&gt;&gt;Reto Meier: Absolutely.

00:45:29.150 --> 00:45:30.860
&gt;&gt;Ian Ni-Lewis: And that is definitely all
the time we have but we've been able to cover

00:45:30.860 --> 00:45:32.990
all the apps so I'm really pleased about that.

00:45:32.990 --> 00:45:41.590
Thanks very much to our engineer Daniel Pham
and our producer Alex Lucas and I think it's

00:45:41.590 --> 00:45:42.590
about time to sign off.

00:45:42.590 --> 00:45:43.590
&gt;&gt;Reto Meier: Yeah.

00:45:43.590 --> 00:45:44.590
I think we'll sign out.

00:45:44.590 --> 00:45:47.140
So we're gonna have, engineer Daniel is gonna
come in front of the camera and join you,

00:45:47.140 --> 00:45:48.140
I think, this, this week, Ian.

00:45:48.140 --> 00:45:49.140
&gt;&gt;Ian Ni-Lewis: Yes.

00:45:49.140 --> 00:45:51.580
&gt;&gt;Reto Meier: We're gonna have a look at some
NFL games.

00:45:51.580 --> 00:45:56.570
That should be exciting and I'm not sure what
we've got scheduled for next week in terms

00:45:56.570 --> 00:45:58.080
of the app clinic.

00:45:58.080 --> 00:45:59.310
Do we know for certain?

00:45:59.310 --> 00:46:03.050
&gt;&gt;Daniel Pham: We actually haven't decided
yet but you made a great post on G Plus asking

00:46:03.050 --> 00:46:08.600
for topics so I think we should take a look
at that and, you know, choose based on what

00:46:08.600 --> 00:46:09.600
people wanna see.

00:46:09.600 --> 00:46:10.600
&gt;&gt;Reto Meier: Perfect.

00:46:10.600 --> 00:46:11.600
&gt;&gt;Ian Ni-Lewis: That was your personal G Plus,
right?

00:46:11.600 --> 00:46:12.600
&gt;&gt;Reto Meier: Yeah, it was.

00:46:12.600 --> 00:46:16.360
So we're gonna go through that list and see
what you guys want us to have a look at and

00:46:16.360 --> 00:46:21.500
we'll update the moderator page with the details
for that and look for your suggestions over

00:46:21.500 --> 00:46:24.640
the, well, what is for us here in the US at
least, a long weekend.

00:46:24.640 --> 00:46:25.650
&gt;&gt;Ian Ni-Lewis: Excellent.

00:46:25.650 --> 00:46:30.600
&gt;&gt;Reto Meier: So, until then, enjoy the weekend
and hopefully stayed tuned for the Friday

00:46:30.600 --> 00:46:31.810
games review.

00:46:31.810 --> 00:46:32.690
Goodbye.
