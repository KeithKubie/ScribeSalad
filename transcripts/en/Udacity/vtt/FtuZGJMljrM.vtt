00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.000
I want you to consider these five situations.

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:09.000
Lifting a brick by carrying it up some steps at constant speed, walking this bucket up a ladder

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:14.000
at constant speed, pushing a crate up an inclined plane at constant speed,

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:19.000
or using a pulley to lift a rock at constant speed,

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:23.000
or Galileo standing at the edge of the Leaning Tower of Pisa dropping an object.

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:26.000
I want you to tell me which of these situations

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:31.000
would there be nonzero total work done on the object in question?

00:00:31.000 --> 99:59:59.000
Check the box next to the appropriate object.
