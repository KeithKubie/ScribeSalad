00:00:00.130 --> 00:00:02.920
These were the missing signs and numbers for the perfect square trinomial

00:00:02.920 --> 00:00:07.752
patterns. Great work if you got all four of these correct. We know the first

00:00:07.752 --> 00:00:12.850
one needs to be positive 9, because this middle term is positive 18x. When we

00:00:12.850 --> 00:00:17.260
have the quantity a plus b squared, we know we'll get a squared plus 2ab plus b

00:00:17.260 --> 00:00:24.530
squared. So, this middle term is 2 times the multiplication of these two terms.

00:00:24.530 --> 00:00:27.430
Since we already have an x here, we know that we just need two times this

00:00:27.430 --> 00:00:32.043
number. So this number would have to be 9. We use similar reasoning to figure

00:00:32.043 --> 00:00:35.268
out the other three problems, and we just need to pay attention to what sign

00:00:35.268 --> 00:00:40.511
this is. This sign will indicate what sign we use in the parentheses. If it's a

00:00:40.511 --> 00:00:44.530
minus, we'll use minus. If it's a plus, we'll use plus.
