JOHN DOLHUN: You got the sock?

00:00:02.460 --> 00:00:03.960
OK.

00:00:03.960 --> 00:00:07.660
So I'm just going to put
the sock in here.

00:00:07.660 --> 00:00:08.770
He's going to catch it.

00:00:08.770 --> 00:00:11.400
[LOUD POPPING NOISE]

00:00:11.400 --> 00:00:13.440
There it goes.

00:00:13.440 --> 00:00:15.200
Let's check his sock out.

00:00:15.200 --> 00:00:17.308
Is it still OK?

00:00:17.308 --> 00:00:55.290
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:00:55.290 --> 00:00:57.260
NARRATOR: It's day one.

00:00:57.260 --> 00:01:00.440
MIT instructor John Dolhun
introduces the course.

00:01:00.440 --> 00:01:03.640
JOHN DOLHUN: You're going to
learn basic skills that will

00:01:03.640 --> 00:01:08.350
form building blocks in your
future adventures at MIT and

00:01:08.350 --> 00:01:09.890
outside of MIT.

00:01:09.890 --> 00:01:13.250
NARRATOR: That is,
if you pass.

00:01:13.250 --> 00:01:15.220
And what exactly
does that take?

00:01:15.220 --> 00:01:18.500
JOHN DOLHUN: You're going to get
about 14 hours of lecture,

00:01:18.500 --> 00:01:21.630
about 52 to 75 hours of lab.

00:01:21.630 --> 00:01:25.460
We only have two and
a half weeks.

00:01:25.460 --> 00:01:30.230
You have to be able to think out
of the box, be creative,

00:01:30.230 --> 00:01:34.720
and most importantly, be mindful
of your mistakes.

00:01:34.720 --> 00:01:36.090
PHIL: The hoods are
over there...

00:01:36.090 --> 00:01:38.290
NARRATOR: Next, safety
training.

00:01:38.290 --> 00:01:41.030
Remember, for many of the
students this is their first

00:01:41.030 --> 00:01:42.200
time in the lab.

00:01:42.200 --> 00:01:46.610
No flip-flops, no shorts, no
skirts, but most importantly,

00:01:46.610 --> 00:01:48.760
gloves and goggles starting
tomorrow.

00:01:48.760 --> 00:01:51.190
PHIL: They tell you to wear
goggles and everything.

00:01:51.190 --> 00:01:53.460
And you don't really realize the
importance until you have

00:01:53.460 --> 00:01:55.830
a piece of glass flying
at your face.

00:01:55.830 --> 00:01:58.690
NARRATOR: After four hours of
lecture, the students finally

00:01:58.690 --> 00:01:59.780
check into the lab.

00:01:59.780 --> 00:02:01.140
TENGFEI: My name is Tengfei.

00:02:01.140 --> 00:02:03.680
And this is Phil.

00:02:03.680 --> 00:02:06.900
And we will be the TAs
for this class.

00:02:06.900 --> 00:02:10.554
This is all the equipment you
should have in your drawer and

00:02:10.554 --> 00:02:11.288
the cabinet.

00:02:11.288 --> 00:02:22.046
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:02:22.046 --> 00:02:22.372
AUDIENCE: Oh.

00:02:22.372 --> 00:02:23.530
Nevermind.

00:02:23.530 --> 00:02:26.050
ETHAN: I guess I get the antique
shelf or something.

00:02:26.050 --> 00:02:28.480
But we'll work around it.

00:02:33.340 --> 00:02:35.930
NARRATOR: After checking in, the
students get introduced to

00:02:35.930 --> 00:02:37.670
a technique called
nuclear magnetic

00:02:37.670 --> 00:02:40.860
resonance, or NMR for short.

00:02:40.860 --> 00:02:44.810
NMR helps chemists piece
together a molecule structure.

00:02:44.810 --> 00:02:48.390
The students put their mystery
molecule into a thin tube and

00:02:48.390 --> 00:02:51.810
lower it into a very powerful
magnetic field.

00:02:51.810 --> 00:02:55.130
This forces certain atoms in the
sample to align themselves

00:02:55.130 --> 00:02:57.930
either with or against
the field.

00:02:57.930 --> 00:03:00.440
Aligning with the field
takes less energy.

00:03:00.440 --> 00:03:02.810
So there are a few more
atoms aligned with

00:03:02.810 --> 00:03:04.870
than against the field.

00:03:04.870 --> 00:03:07.580
A pulse of energy makes the
extra atoms aligned with the

00:03:07.580 --> 00:03:09.290
field flip.

00:03:09.290 --> 00:03:12.470
The computer measures how much
energy this takes and produces

00:03:12.470 --> 00:03:13.970
a spectrum.

00:03:13.970 --> 00:03:17.280
The amount of energy it takes
to flip an atom depends on

00:03:17.280 --> 00:03:19.350
what other atoms
are next to it.

00:03:19.350 --> 00:03:22.890
That means you can tell which of
the atoms are connected and

00:03:22.890 --> 00:03:26.460
put together a picture of what
the whole molecule looks like.

00:03:26.460 --> 00:03:27.890
That's the theory.

00:03:27.890 --> 00:03:30.290
But the students are about to
learn that dealing with a real

00:03:30.290 --> 00:03:33.160
live machine is not so simple.

00:03:33.160 --> 00:03:34.447
ANNE RACHUPKA: Awful lot
we're going to go over.

00:03:34.447 --> 00:03:36.395
These are live magnets.

00:03:36.395 --> 00:03:38.343
They are in field
at all times.

00:03:38.343 --> 00:03:43.213
You cannot go anywhere near it
with iPod, iPhone, any USB

00:03:43.213 --> 00:03:47.109
storage devices, no push pins,
no staples, no bobby pins.

00:03:47.109 --> 00:03:49.070
We have our little sample?

00:03:49.070 --> 00:03:51.740
I have taken people to the
hospital because they've put

00:03:51.740 --> 00:03:53.500
an NMR tube through
their hand.

00:03:53.500 --> 00:03:56.380
Definitely don't bring your
wallet anywhere near the

00:03:56.380 --> 00:03:56.860
instrument.

00:03:56.860 --> 00:04:00.230
This costs probably more than
one year tuition to MIT.

00:04:00.230 --> 00:04:02.230
Obviously, this is not
going to work.

00:04:02.230 --> 00:04:05.410
Do not, under any circumstances,
insert your

00:04:05.410 --> 00:04:07.750
sample without the air on.

00:04:07.750 --> 00:04:09.430
You guys have any burning
questions?

00:04:09.430 --> 00:04:11.610
You're all going to be experts
the first time you sit down

00:04:11.610 --> 00:04:11.940
[INAUDIBLE].

00:04:11.940 --> 00:04:12.660
Right?

00:04:12.660 --> 00:04:14.900
LEALIA: We were all like, uh--

00:04:14.900 --> 00:04:15.680
ANTHONY: Mmm.

00:04:15.680 --> 00:04:16.800
ETHAN: Oh dear God.

00:04:16.800 --> 00:04:20.690
JULIE: Can we just not talk
about this anymore?

00:04:20.690 --> 00:04:22.720
NARRATOR: The day
is finally over.

00:04:22.720 --> 00:04:26.140
And it's time to head home.

00:04:26.140 --> 00:04:28.400
IKE: It was pretty intimidating
because I walked

00:04:28.400 --> 00:04:30.440
into this class with all
these smart people.

00:04:30.440 --> 00:04:32.410
ETHAN: I felt, I guess, a
little bit overwhelmed.

00:04:32.410 --> 00:04:36.430
I wasn't exactly sure what
to expect from 5.301.

00:04:36.430 --> 00:04:39.096
EMILY: I didn't expect it
to be this much work.

00:04:39.096 --> 00:04:42.470
I'm kind of doubting whether I
made the right choice to take

00:04:42.470 --> 00:04:43.370
this class.

00:04:43.370 --> 00:04:46.800
ETHAN: Oh my God, what
have I gotten into ?

00:04:46.800 --> 00:04:48.980
ANTHONY: I am going to
fail this class.

a fan of cupcakes.

00:04:58.620 --> 00:05:01.850
But now that they're popular,
I'm a big fan of cupcakes.

00:05:01.850 --> 00:05:04.330

make us dessert?

00:05:04.330 --> 00:05:05.040

an ice cream social?
