00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.380
In this video, we're going to show you how to make glass arrowheads using the same technique that native Americans used for hundreds of years.

00:00:12.560 --> 00:00:17.040
Hey guys! We're here with my friend Clay today and he is going to be teaching us how to make arrow heads

00:00:17.120 --> 00:00:18.560
out of glass bottles.

00:00:18.560 --> 00:00:19.660
Nate: Clay, how did you get into this?

00:00:19.660 --> 00:00:21.160
Clay: I've been into it for quite awhile.

00:00:21.160 --> 00:00:26.140
Ever since I was a little kid I found a little arrowhead in out yard and thought it was cool and I taught myself how to make them.

00:00:26.140 --> 00:00:27.020
--Very cool.

00:00:27.020 --> 00:00:31.000
So, this arrowhead that I have right here is one that you've made previously. Correct?

00:00:31.140 --> 00:00:32.900
Now, this one is made of ...

00:00:32.900 --> 00:00:33.720
--Obsidian.

00:00:33.720 --> 00:00:35.680
So, obsidian is a volcanic glass.

00:00:35.700 --> 00:00:40.220
It's basically, nearly the exact same as glass bottles.

00:00:40.220 --> 00:00:42.700
Obsidian is just lava that cooled really quickly.

00:00:42.700 --> 00:00:44.340
So quickly that it just turned into glass.

00:00:44.340 --> 00:00:48.140
--Alright. So, why is it we're using glass instead of obsidian rock?

00:00:48.140 --> 00:00:50.840
--This glass is a lot easier to work with.

00:00:50.840 --> 00:00:54.580
Obsidian with have all kinds of other stuff mixed in that can make it harder to work with.

00:00:54.580 --> 00:00:57.520
--So, it's a lot more impure and I suspect it's also harder to get your hands on.

00:00:57.520 --> 00:00:58.040
--Yes.

00:00:58.040 --> 00:01:02.020
--Lots of availability for glass, less availability for actual obsidian.

00:01:02.020 --> 00:01:05.360
But, the principles are the same and it works pretty much the same way?

00:01:05.720 --> 00:01:06.920
--Yeah. Exactly.

00:01:06.920 --> 00:01:08.060
--Here's what we're going to try.

00:01:08.060 --> 00:01:12.500
The bottom of a glass bottle is fairly flat and by using a rock and a piece of a nail,

00:01:12.500 --> 00:01:14.660
we can press little chips of glass off,

00:01:14.660 --> 00:01:18.080
shaping it into an arrowhead and sharpening it at the same time.

00:01:18.080 --> 00:01:19.720
So, what do we need to get started?

00:01:19.720 --> 00:01:23.480
--Ok. The first thing we need to do is you need to get a bunch of glass bottles.

00:01:23.480 --> 00:01:26.520
The best ones are the ones that kind of have a flat bottom.

00:01:26.700 --> 00:01:29.900
So, you want to get rid of all of the curved spots .

00:01:29.900 --> 00:01:32.100
You don't have to use glass bottles.

00:01:32.100 --> 00:01:33.640
You can use pretty much any kind glass.

00:01:33.640 --> 00:01:34.880
Tv monitors, whatever.

00:01:34.880 --> 00:01:38.120
As long as it's glass and you have a nice flat section.

00:01:38.120 --> 00:01:41.020
--What's the minimum thickness you would say we need?

00:01:41.020 --> 00:01:47.140
--I'd probably say, the best thickness is probably somewhere around 1/8ths of an inch in thickness.

00:01:47.140 --> 00:01:49.600
So, most bottles are about that thickness.

00:01:49.600 --> 00:01:50.100
--Cool.

00:01:50.100 --> 00:01:53.340
--So, first thing we need to do is just get the bottoms right off the bottle.

00:01:53.340 --> 00:01:55.240
--We need to get the bottom off of the bottle.

00:01:55.240 --> 00:01:57.440
How do you usually, do you just take a hammer to it?

00:01:57.440 --> 00:02:02.880
--You can take a hammer to if you want or you can actually drop like a heavy drill bit down and then just shake it

00:02:02.880 --> 00:02:05.420
and then the bottom will just break right off.

00:02:05.420 --> 00:02:08.440
The first thing you really need is a leather pad.

00:02:08.440 --> 00:02:11.200
You definitely don't want glass shards getting into your hands.

00:02:11.200 --> 00:02:12.280
--I don't! You're right!

00:02:13.380 --> 00:02:15.540
--It isn't really comfortable.

00:02:15.540 --> 00:02:18.600
The second thing you need is like a round stone.

00:02:18.600 --> 00:02:23.280
That will help us kind of get a nice edge formed on the bottle and on the arrowhead.

00:02:23.280 --> 00:02:25.540
And then you also need pressure flaker.

00:02:25.540 --> 00:02:29.900
So, what we're going to do is we're going to put a nail to a dowel and sharpen the point.

00:02:29.940 --> 00:02:35.540
That'll allow us to pressure flake off the edge of the glass and shape the arrowhead.

00:02:35.540 --> 00:02:37.940
The native Americans would us antler for this.

00:02:37.940 --> 00:02:42.000
We could also do that but I found a steal nail works really well too.

00:02:51.720 --> 00:02:55.540
Nate: Either nails are a lot harder than I knew or we really need to replace this blade.

00:02:59.520 --> 00:03:02.140
So, now I need to make these pointy. Right?

00:03:02.140 --> 00:03:02.640
--Yes.

00:03:02.640 --> 00:03:03.600
--Pointy, pointy.

00:03:05.580 --> 00:03:06.100
Nate: That's a good file.

00:03:06.100 --> 00:03:07.760
--Yeah, the file is better than the saw.

00:03:09.980 --> 00:03:11.040
--It's not needle sharp.

00:03:11.040 --> 00:03:14.020
I can press on it and it's not stabbing into my finger right now.

00:03:14.020 --> 00:03:17.320
But, I can feel it. It's very pointy as I press it onto my finger.

00:03:17.320 --> 00:03:22.020
So, now we can see I have a slightly more sharp and a slightly less sharp.

00:03:22.020 --> 00:03:24.920
I assume the shape of my piece of leather isn't really important.

00:03:24.920 --> 00:03:26.000
--No. Not really.

00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:31.700
--Alright. Well yours looks better than mine so I'm at least going to trim some of my extra, random extensions.

00:03:31.700 --> 00:03:35.900
We've got our leather. We've got our rocks. We have pointy tools.

00:03:35.900 --> 00:03:38.020
Do these have a name? Or do we just call them "pointy tools"?

00:03:38.020 --> 00:03:39.740
--Pressure flakers.

00:03:39.740 --> 00:03:40.860
--Pressure flakers

00:03:40.860 --> 00:03:42.600
I think now we need some glass right?

00:03:42.600 --> 00:03:43.100
--Yup!

00:03:43.100 --> 00:03:47.580
--Alright. You said that we want to choose a glass bottle that has a mostly flat bottom to it.

00:03:47.580 --> 00:03:48.780
Does the color make any difference?

00:03:48.780 --> 00:03:51.160
--The color doesn't make any difference whatsoever.

00:03:51.160 --> 00:03:52.280
--So just choose your preference.

00:03:52.300 --> 00:03:52.800
--Mmhm

00:03:52.800 --> 00:03:58.860
--Alright. Let's go outside so that all of our glass is not in the workshop where I'm going to end up cutting my hands on it later.

00:03:58.860 --> 00:04:00.960
[Deep pitch] Cutting my hands on it later.

00:04:01.980 --> 00:04:04.060
That is stabbed into my finger.

00:04:04.060 --> 00:04:06.100
It's obviously stabbed through the glove.

00:04:06.100 --> 00:04:08.960
I'm just telling you, it's also stabbed into my finger.

00:04:08.960 --> 00:04:09.960
Glass is sharp, kids!

00:04:10.040 --> 00:04:10.840
And adults.

00:04:10.840 --> 00:04:12.120
It's really sharp.

00:04:12.120 --> 00:04:13.780
It doesn't matter if you're a kid or an adult.

00:04:13.840 --> 00:04:14.340
AH!

00:04:14.340 --> 00:04:20.660
After cracking a couple of our glass discs in half we grabbed a couple more bottle and we're just going to do the same thing.

00:04:23.560 --> 00:04:25.560
Clay: That didn't quite work.

00:04:26.580 --> 00:04:27.780
--Well, it broke.

00:04:28.300 --> 00:04:29.980
Alright, here's a stone.

00:04:30.880 --> 00:04:31.920
Oh. There we go.

00:04:39.520 --> 00:04:40.200
And there you've got the bottom.

00:04:40.200 --> 00:04:47.200
So, I was worried with the drill bit since this was a large flat bottom that if it hit in the center then it would crack lengthwise instead of breaking

00:04:47.200 --> 00:04:48.040
the bottom off.

00:04:48.040 --> 00:04:50.460
Alright clay. We both have our glass bottle bottoms.

00:04:50.460 --> 00:04:51.380
What's the next step?

00:04:51.380 --> 00:04:55.600
--So, the first thing we need to do is make a nice edge along the base of the glass here.

00:04:55.600 --> 00:04:59.300
--Are we just going for round or are we trying to get the arrowhead shape already?

00:04:59.300 --> 00:05:02.620
--We're just trying to get rid of this curved edge along the bottom.

00:05:02.620 --> 00:05:04.500
--Okay. So like all of the ridges and stuff.

00:05:04.500 --> 00:05:05.260
--Exactly.

00:05:05.380 --> 00:05:08.740
So, for that, we kind of want to use eye protection.

00:05:08.740 --> 00:05:12.160
I've gotten glass in my eye once. It's not fun and not worth it.

00:05:12.160 --> 00:05:16.340
--Doesn't sound fun. Now, the goggles I have are very, very stylish.

00:05:16.340 --> 00:05:20.080
These are welding goggles and it would be too dark but, don't worry.

00:05:20.080 --> 00:05:21.380
It pops up like that.

00:05:21.400 --> 00:05:24.900
So, I get to look full on mad scientist.

00:05:24.900 --> 00:05:25.460
[Whispering] Yeah!

00:05:29.260 --> 00:05:32.140
Nate: I'm not really able to break it right.

00:05:32.140 --> 00:05:33.020
What am I doing wrong?

00:05:33.020 --> 00:05:35.340
To get it to go all the way around that curve more?

00:05:35.340 --> 00:05:36.720
--So, what I would do on this one ...

00:05:36.720 --> 00:05:38.940
You've already kind of got an edge.

00:05:38.940 --> 00:05:41.800
I might even just go straight to the pressure flaker on this one.

00:05:41.800 --> 00:05:44.560
You use your tool and you just push against the edge

00:05:44.960 --> 00:05:48.820
and then the glass, it will flake off.

00:05:48.820 --> 00:05:51.280
--This little lip where it turns back up.

00:05:51.280 --> 00:05:53.300
We're still trying to remove that curve.

00:05:53.420 --> 00:05:54.220
--Exactly.

00:05:54.680 --> 00:05:57.240
--So you recommend I push on this side.

00:05:57.540 --> 00:05:58.500
--In that way.

00:05:58.500 --> 00:05:59.140
--That driection

00:05:59.180 --> 00:05:59.740
--Yeah.

00:05:59.740 --> 00:06:00.800
--To get rid of that edge.

00:06:00.800 --> 00:06:01.300
--Mmhm

00:06:03.440 --> 00:06:10.440
--So, I have taken off most of that edge but, I now have almost like a different curved edge that I've put into it.

00:06:10.440 --> 00:06:11.140
--And that's okay.

00:06:11.140 --> 00:06:14.600
--Do I just go at it from the other side now and kind of take it down way?

00:06:14.600 --> 00:06:15.740
--Exactly. That's what I would do.

00:06:15.740 --> 00:06:23.620
So, what you really want to do is actually dull the edge but, also, you want a nice platform for you to make pressure flakes on.

00:06:23.620 --> 00:06:29.280
So, in order to do that you want a curved edge on the opposite side that you're actually going to be pushing.

00:06:29.280 --> 00:06:33.320
But, you want to be convex curve instead of concave which was kind of right here.

00:06:33.320 --> 00:06:35.160
So, you can kind of see what I'm doing?

00:06:35.200 --> 00:06:39.680
--Yeah you're just kind of scraping down the sharp edge.

00:06:39.700 --> 00:06:41.920
So, it's a flat rough surface.

00:06:41.920 --> 00:06:47.880
--You can actually just kind of grind it down because what happens it when you try to pressure flake on a sharp edge,

00:06:47.880 --> 00:06:49.680
it'll just kind of break the edge off.

00:06:49.680 --> 00:06:55.080
But, if you have a dull edge then you can grab more of the surface and then pull large flakes off.

00:06:55.080 --> 00:06:56.760
--Make it dull so you can make it sharp.

00:06:57.040 --> 00:06:57.840
--Exactly.

00:07:00.540 --> 00:07:07.540
--And if you are in a real survival situation, you know, you found a chunk of obsidian or just a piece of glass somewhere

00:07:07.840 --> 00:07:10.500
you didn't have this nice nail in a stick.

00:07:10.500 --> 00:07:19.760
--With a small stone you could still kind of make a nice cutting edge for, I don't know, if you had to cut up some game or what have you.

00:07:19.760 --> 00:07:23.780
--And right now we're kind of working on making arrowhead type pieces.

00:07:23.780 --> 00:07:27.380
Can the same principle be used for making knife type pieces?

00:07:27.380 --> 00:07:27.920
I assume?

00:07:27.920 --> 00:07:29.160
--Yeah. Yeah exactly.

00:07:29.180 --> 00:07:34.560
--Just need a bigger flat piece and more time.

00:07:34.620 --> 00:07:35.120
--Yeah

00:07:38.180 --> 00:07:44.020
--At this point I've gotten my piece of glass to - most of the curve removed and there's a jagged edge going all the way around.

00:07:44.040 --> 00:07:49.880
I've napped across most of the surfaces, the concave and what used to be convex surface.

00:07:49.880 --> 00:07:51.120
So, what's my next step?

00:07:51.120 --> 00:07:55.000
--Dull the edge like you've been doing and kind of make a platform on one side.

00:07:55.000 --> 00:08:01.120
So, like at this point I would make a platform probably on this side and push flakes across this direction.

00:08:01.380 --> 00:08:02.340
Or vice versa.

00:08:02.340 --> 00:08:03.500
And just keep doing that.

00:08:03.500 --> 00:08:11.380
Like I would do that on this edge here, and then I would do it kind of on this edge here and maybe over here and eventually you're going to end up with kind of an arrowhead shape.

00:08:16.200 --> 00:08:22.920
--Well I was making my arrowhead and things were going really nice and then somehow I managed to drop it.

00:08:23.140 --> 00:08:25.220
Tip of the arrowhead broke off.

00:08:25.220 --> 00:08:31.160
I think I'm just going to finish it up as though it were the same size so I can at least just like place the tip of it next to it and

00:08:31.160 --> 00:08:33.140
see what it looked like when it was in-tact.

00:08:33.140 --> 00:08:39.440
Now what I need to do is add some notches on the back where I can use a cord or something to attach the arrowhead onto an arrow.

00:08:39.440 --> 00:08:46.440
The notches are going to be put in about the same way we've been doing the rest of the shaping which is just to chip off, flake off little bit at a time

00:08:46.480 --> 00:08:48.800
and just sort of tunnel your way in.

00:08:48.800 --> 00:08:51.780
Chip a little bit on one side and then chip a little bit on the other side.

00:08:51.780 --> 00:08:54.680
I'm trying very hard not to break the back of the arrowhead off.

00:08:54.700 --> 00:08:56.360
Which, I will try.

00:08:56.360 --> 00:08:57.600
I haven't done this before.

00:08:57.880 --> 00:08:59.560
So, we'll see how it goes.

00:09:04.160 --> 00:09:10.100
Made from glass bottles, we now have a couple of completed arrowheads, native American style.

00:09:10.100 --> 00:09:12.820
--Well, other than they're from glass bottles.

00:09:12.820 --> 00:09:15.760
--Did the native Americans not have glass bottles?

00:09:15.760 --> 00:09:16.500
--They did not.

00:09:16.500 --> 00:09:18.540
--I've got to study history a little better.

00:09:18.540 --> 00:09:24.660
So, yeah, they used obsidian or flint or other types of rock that did tend to chip in a similar way.

00:09:24.740 --> 00:09:31.740
We have the advantage of glass which, while it breaks in a similar method, it's often a lot cleaner and more pure in its formula,

00:09:31.740 --> 00:09:35.240
so it breaks predictably making it a better thing to practice on.

00:09:35.240 --> 00:09:37.900
Mine, of course, as I showed the tip of it broke off.

00:09:37.900 --> 00:09:41.640
I just used a small drop of super glue and glued it right back on.

00:09:41.640 --> 00:09:46.440
The two pieces of glass fit together so nicely, you can't hardly even see the divnisioning line.

00:09:46.440 --> 00:09:50.420
Probably not as good for hunting at this point, but it looks good.

00:09:50.420 --> 00:09:55.760
--So, one really cool thing about glass is when it breaks, it actually is sharper than steel.

00:09:55.760 --> 00:09:59.600
It will almost go down to the atom scale when it breaks.

00:09:59.600 --> 00:10:06.300
So, these are actually really effective points even though they're quite fragile and would probably be only single use.

00:10:07.140 --> 00:10:09.920
--Now, clay, you've got a bunch of different varieties of glass.

00:10:09.920 --> 00:10:12.040
So, you don't always use a glass bottle for this, do you?

00:10:12.040 --> 00:10:15.520
--No. You can actually use just about anything that will break.

00:10:15.520 --> 00:10:16.900
So, these are obsidian pieces.

00:10:17.060 --> 00:10:20.580
This is actually pieces of from like an old tv screen.

00:10:20.760 --> 00:10:23.560
Some, artificial man-made glass as well.

00:10:23.560 --> 00:10:25.320
This one's got glitter. Pretty!

00:10:26.100 --> 00:10:28.980
And then I've got some custom mixed pieces.

00:10:28.980 --> 00:10:30.980
--Interesting swirls of color.

00:10:30.980 --> 00:10:32.680
Psychedelic arrowheads right there.

00:10:32.680 --> 00:10:34.580
Some nice, clear, blueish glass.

00:10:34.580 --> 00:10:35.840
This would be a pretty good one, I think.

00:10:35.840 --> 00:10:37.300
It's a good thickness.

00:10:37.300 --> 00:10:41.100
--It's pretty easy to hit up your local thrift store and find some old glass dish-ware.

00:10:41.100 --> 00:10:41.860
--Very cool.

00:10:41.860 --> 00:10:47.360
Right here, I've got and olive oil bottle that not only has a fairly flat bottom but, the sides of it are also flat.

00:10:47.360 --> 00:10:51.400
So, you could probably break this up and get several arrowheads our of it.

00:10:51.400 --> 00:10:55.400
--Yeah. This one, you could probably easily get eight or nine arrowheads just from the sides.

00:10:55.400 --> 00:10:58.420
--Glass jars from food can also work really well.

00:10:58.420 --> 00:10:59.340
--Just no tempered glass.

00:10:59.340 --> 00:11:01.940
That's the only thing that really wouldn't work for this.

00:11:01.940 --> 00:11:03.040
--It would just shatter into a bunch of pieces, huh?

00:11:03.040 --> 00:11:03.540
--Yeah.

00:11:03.660 --> 00:11:04.220
--Okay.

00:11:04.220 --> 00:11:09.340
Special thanks to our friend, Clay, for coming out and showing us how to make arrowheads out of glass bottles.

00:11:09.340 --> 00:11:15.260
Clay has helped us out on a couple of our previous rocket videos and we hope to collaborate with him again in the future with some more rockets.

00:11:15.400 --> 00:11:16.280
--Exciting.

00:11:16.280 --> 00:11:17.280
--Should be good stuff.

00:11:20.340 --> 00:11:21.700
Guys, there's still more for you to see.

00:11:21.700 --> 00:11:25.760
The box up at the top will transport you directly to our last video and you should go check that out.

00:11:25.760 --> 00:11:28.720
The box at the bottom will show you what Youtube thinks you need to be watching next

00:11:28.720 --> 00:11:32.020
and this bomb in the middle will subscribe you to the channel so you never miss a video.

00:11:32.020 --> 00:11:34.280
Don't forget to ring the bell and we'll see you in the next one.

00:11:34.320 --> 00:11:35.440
Talk to you then.
