WEBVTT

1
00:00:00.240 --> 00:00:02.490
About the Joe Rogan experience.

2
00:00:03.510 --> 00:00:06.180
If the aliens came to you and said,
rich,
yeah,

3
00:00:06.270 --> 00:00:08.710
we're going to give you this technology,
whatever it is probably gonna be yes.

4
00:00:09.120 --> 00:00:12.930
Can't tell anyone else.
Yeah.
Would you be willing to what technology?

5
00:00:13.300 --> 00:00:17.560
What if the government brings you to area 51 like Bob Ozar and they bring you

6
00:00:17.561 --> 00:00:20.460
down into the base.
Yeah and they show you an alien spacecraft and they go,

7
00:00:20.490 --> 00:00:22.350
we're going to let you examine this.

8
00:00:22.351 --> 00:00:25.470
We know that you'd love to tinker and back engineer things but you can't tell

9
00:00:25.471 --> 00:00:28.860
anybody are you in?
I'll do it in a heartbeat.
The hell not because you have a,

10
00:00:29.070 --> 00:00:31.470
you owe us the rest of the human race.

11
00:00:31.590 --> 00:00:33.330
Like these fucking assholes and the government,

12
00:00:33.331 --> 00:00:35.550
they're going to keep you telling us the truth.

13
00:00:35.920 --> 00:00:38.730
Don't you think it would affect the whole world if we knew now,
honestly,

14
00:00:38.731 --> 00:00:41.490
I probably tell you on anyways cause the fact that they called the Tesla guy to

15
00:00:41.491 --> 00:00:43.320
go down there,
you of course you're going to rat them out.

16
00:00:43.410 --> 00:00:45.480
Well that's who I would call if I was the government.

17
00:00:45.481 --> 00:00:49.320
I wouldn't call some respectable scientist from Stanford cause that guy,

18
00:00:50.150 --> 00:00:53.190
I would call some dude who would be like easily discredited.

19
00:00:53.191 --> 00:00:58.191
So the guy who may be like a little little fudgy with science reports and

20
00:00:59.490 --> 00:01:03.180
vicious and maybe plagiarize a little bit in college,
but he knows his shit.

21
00:01:03.181 --> 00:01:06.910
That's me.
Yeah.
But no,
I would,

22
00:01:07.500 --> 00:01:09.480
I would go with some guy who's,
um,

23
00:01:09.580 --> 00:01:13.890
w w what does that autodidactic is that the word someone learns themselves?

24
00:01:14.580 --> 00:01:18.120
Is that what the word is?
There's a lot,
right?
Is that the word?

25
00:01:18.330 --> 00:01:21.180
There's a lot of geniuses out there that just don't have the credentials.

26
00:01:21.240 --> 00:01:25.220
Very smart people.
And just auto didactic.
The didactic.
Yeah.
Take that guy,

27
00:01:25.530 --> 00:01:27.250
take that guy.
What do you do that now?

28
00:01:27.450 --> 00:01:29.640
I tell everybody why a hundred percent why would you,

29
00:01:29.641 --> 00:01:32.760
why do you trust those assholes?
You know,
owe anyone anything.
Cause I would,

30
00:01:32.820 --> 00:01:35.070
I would want everyone to know,
well,
what are they gonna do with it?

31
00:01:35.071 --> 00:01:38.520
They have to live with myself.
Really.
100% yeah.

32
00:01:38.521 --> 00:01:40.650
If the government wants to tell me some secrets,
let me tell you something.

33
00:01:40.740 --> 00:01:44.880
I'll tell everybody.
Yeah.
Would you say that first?
I would definitely tell them.

34
00:01:44.881 --> 00:01:48.480
I'm telling everybody realizes they don't show it to me freely.
Yeah,

35
00:01:48.481 --> 00:01:52.020
I would say don't show it to me that's not progressing the human race forward

36
00:01:52.290 --> 00:01:55.380
because there's always the goal is for you to see it and confirm it.
Right.

37
00:01:55.600 --> 00:01:58.300
You want to see a converter and tell everyone,
you just be willing to say,

38
00:01:59.100 --> 00:02:02.340
I don't want to die and I don't want them to kill me.
So I would say,
listen,

39
00:02:02.400 --> 00:02:04.170
if you show me how you for that,

40
00:02:04.620 --> 00:02:08.330
maybe people have died already and we don't know.
It's deep maybe bro.
Yeah,

41
00:02:08.940 --> 00:02:13.530
look into it.
I'm like,
I don't know.

42
00:02:13.600 --> 00:02:17.880
It would be a thing where I would,
in all honesty,

43
00:02:17.881 --> 00:02:20.850
it depends on what stage of my life.
If I was 30 years old and they said,

44
00:02:20.851 --> 00:02:23.490
I'm going to show you this,
but you can't show anybody,
are you willing?

45
00:02:23.491 --> 00:02:27.120
I'd be like,
yeah,
sure,
show me,
but at 50 I'd be like,

46
00:02:28.300 --> 00:02:32.820
no,
no.
I'm not making any deals.
I don't want to make a deal.

47
00:02:32.821 --> 00:02:35.400
Or You tell me that.
I can't tell anybody about,

48
00:02:35.610 --> 00:02:38.100
I mean it's one thing if it's a business thing,
like,
hey,
we're going to,

49
00:02:38.160 --> 00:02:40.710
Apple's going to show you the new iPhone.
Don't tell anybody.
Oh,
for sure.

50
00:02:40.711 --> 00:02:42.030
I won't tell anybody.
Right,
fine,

51
00:02:42.070 --> 00:02:45.440
but this is something what can affect the human race?
How would Ald,

52
00:02:45.490 --> 00:02:49.590
how would the confirmation of aliens affect the human race?
You think?
Well,
yes,

53
00:02:49.591 --> 00:02:52.470
there are aliens now what we're going to do.
Realistically,

54
00:02:52.500 --> 00:02:57.500
you would have to have confirmation that was undeniable and your own eye

55
00:02:58.171 --> 00:03:00.120
witness.
That's not good enough.
Just think you're crazy.

56
00:03:00.130 --> 00:03:01.450
They'll shoot you anyways.
Exactly.

57
00:03:01.451 --> 00:03:04.420
They'll just think you're a fool and they'll just make you look like a dunce and

58
00:03:04.421 --> 00:03:07.210
no one.
It would actually probably help their cause,
right,

59
00:03:07.240 --> 00:03:11.650
because no one would ever believe you and no one would take alien seriously

60
00:03:11.651 --> 00:03:12.101
after that,

61
00:03:12.101 --> 00:03:16.420
which is one of the arguments for like what they actually did with project blue

62
00:03:16.421 --> 00:03:16.700
book.

63
00:03:16.700 --> 00:03:21.700
Like there was a guy named Phillip Corso and Jay Allen Hynek was the guy who was

64
00:03:22.331 --> 00:03:23.900
running project blue book.

65
00:03:23.920 --> 00:03:26.830
One of the things that they famously said after it was over that they were,

66
00:03:27.160 --> 00:03:32.050
they would just try to debunk things and make these things look foolish and then

67
00:03:32.051 --> 00:03:34.690
anything they found that they couldn't explain,
they just tucked away,

68
00:03:35.260 --> 00:03:37.800
but the things that they could explain,
even if the,
the,

69
00:03:37.810 --> 00:03:40.330
the explanation didn't jive.

70
00:03:40.490 --> 00:03:44.350
He came up with an explanation just to make people realize that aliens were

71
00:03:44.351 --> 00:03:49.240
bullshit,
but he,
through the course of project blue book studying now,

72
00:03:49.270 --> 00:03:52.240
now you have to ask your question.
This question here.
Through the end of it,

73
00:03:52.241 --> 00:03:56.440
he decided that aliens were real and that we had been contacted.
Yeah.
However,

74
00:03:56.890 --> 00:03:59.290
you always have to question whether someone,

75
00:03:59.291 --> 00:04:04.291
everything is doing that because this is a new avenue for them to make money.

76
00:04:04.940 --> 00:04:08.680
Yeah.
Is this a new stream of revenue?
I'm going to do the lecture circuit.

77
00:04:08.681 --> 00:04:09.580
I'm going to write books.

78
00:04:09.820 --> 00:04:12.610
I mean if you're a guy where for project blue book and then they shut project

79
00:04:12.611 --> 00:04:15.220
blue book down,
you don't have any more money.
Yeah.
You're broken and you decide,

80
00:04:15.221 --> 00:04:17.680
well,
I don't want work for the government anymore.
You know what I want to do?

81
00:04:17.681 --> 00:04:20.800
I'm going to write stories about Ufo and start a podcast.
Lock these assholes,

82
00:04:20.801 --> 00:04:24.730
right?
I mean,
Jay Allen Hynek died along time ago,
I believe,
right?

83
00:04:26.540 --> 00:04:30.020
Google Jay Allen Hynek project blue book have photos.
All right.

84
00:04:30.100 --> 00:04:35.100
I'm pretty sure there's interviews where after he said he is sure after all of

85
00:04:36.281 --> 00:04:41.180
his time studying that there is and has been some contact with extra

86
00:04:41.190 --> 00:04:45.940
terrestrials.
What do you think?
I don't,
I don't know.
See mean me personally,

87
00:04:45.941 --> 00:04:50.740
I have zero experience.
Right.
All right,
well,
so someone might,
what do you got?

88
00:04:50.780 --> 00:04:53.090
We laughing at?
Ah,
man,
I don't want to talk about it yet.

89
00:04:53.360 --> 00:04:55.970
You don't want to talk about and talk about it yet.
Stuff I've been looking into.

90
00:04:56.060 --> 00:04:57.950
Go ahead about this topic that this guy worked at,

91
00:04:57.951 --> 00:05:01.640
that company I've been told and told you about in,
in Columbus,
Ohio.

92
00:05:01.820 --> 00:05:05.960
He also was a teacher of physics and astronomy at Ohio state in 1936.
Dawn,
dawn,

93
00:05:05.961 --> 00:05:07.670
dawn.
So you think there's some real shit going down.

94
00:05:08.030 --> 00:05:09.800
Maybe you think some real shit's going down.

95
00:05:10.050 --> 00:05:12.150
I know about all the alien technologies are,
uh,

96
00:05:12.600 --> 00:05:15.240
actually like what beings or aliens or something.

97
00:05:16.080 --> 00:05:19.590
There's something going on and it has to do with that company and it has to do

98
00:05:19.591 --> 00:05:21.780
with everything you're talking about and project blue book.

99
00:05:21.810 --> 00:05:24.310
I don't know what it is.
That's very vague.
I know

100
00:05:25.900 --> 00:05:28.450
something's going on guys.
I can't cause it's it,
to me,

101
00:05:28.451 --> 00:05:31.060
it doesn't seem fair to just go with the big conspiracy,

102
00:05:31.061 --> 00:05:33.520
but there are facts that you can look up and find.

103
00:05:33.520 --> 00:05:37.060
So once you get to the bottom of the investigation that you'll have a report for

104
00:05:37.070 --> 00:05:39.850
a yeah,
we'll talk to you.
I'll talk.
I'm not,
I'm not ready to,

105
00:05:40.200 --> 00:05:41.380
just a little too crazy right now.

106
00:05:41.381 --> 00:05:43.410
I want to leave some of the craziest stuff out.
Yeah.

107
00:05:43.450 --> 00:05:48.450
It's one of those subjects that inherently starts looking crazy until alien show

108
00:05:48.491 --> 00:05:51.340
up.
Right there was like that.
What was that movie?
What was the,

109
00:05:51.520 --> 00:05:56.110
the recent movie with the,
the,
where they spoke in like smoke.
Oh.

110
00:05:56.280 --> 00:05:59.600
Oh God.
Um,
was that big arrival arrival.

111
00:06:00.200 --> 00:06:01.760
If something like that shows up,

112
00:06:02.690 --> 00:06:05.310
then all of a sudden our perceptions completely changed.
It's like,
oh wait,

113
00:06:05.390 --> 00:06:06.530
undeniable.

114
00:06:06.620 --> 00:06:11.620
There's like some giant Los Angeles size thing floating over the continental us.

115
00:06:12.560 --> 00:06:16.340
We'd be like,
okay,
all right.
So it has the thing.
So why would you say,
if we,

116
00:06:16.341 --> 00:06:18.940
let's just say we had a microscope,
right?
Periscope,
whatever the,

117
00:06:18.941 --> 00:06:21.470
whatever you call it,
to look in the space.
Really Fullscope telescope.

118
00:06:21.740 --> 00:06:26.240
Periscope it.
If I wasn't a submarine,
so,

119
00:06:26.960 --> 00:06:31.040
and we see an e an alien,
you know,
colony.
Yeah.
I'm like Mars,

120
00:06:31.400 --> 00:06:34.760
what would we do?
Would study it.
Yeah.
We tried to communicate with it,

121
00:06:34.970 --> 00:06:37.670
but would that be a good move?
Like what if they came over to us and they'll go,

122
00:06:37.700 --> 00:06:40.970
oh,
look at these fucking dumb chimps.
Do they think these,
do they,

123
00:06:40.971 --> 00:06:45.770
you think that any foreign or alien species,
we think we're idiots.

124
00:06:46.200 --> 00:06:48.480
100% of really think we're idiots.
Yeah.

125
00:06:48.500 --> 00:06:51.740
If they're advanced to the point where they've gotten control of their emotions

126
00:06:51.741 --> 00:06:52.640
and anger.
Right.

127
00:06:52.760 --> 00:06:56.730
Let me just think about how much tribal warfare goes on still in America,
uh,

128
00:06:56.810 --> 00:07:01.460
in the world.
You know how much,
how much warfare is taking place,

129
00:07:01.461 --> 00:07:04.340
how many people are dying,
how many innocent people are dying,
who drones,

130
00:07:04.341 --> 00:07:05.150
all that kind of stuff,
right?

131
00:07:05.150 --> 00:07:08.300
They'd be aware of all that they'd be aware of are polluting of the environment

132
00:07:08.301 --> 00:07:08.961
they'd be aware of,

133
00:07:08.961 --> 00:07:13.961
are depleting the ocean of it's fish and it's just pulling in giant nets filled

134
00:07:14.061 --> 00:07:16.850
with fish and feed him.
What the fuck are you people doing?

135
00:07:17.000 --> 00:07:19.850
They'd be looking at coal plants and the president of United States the greatest

136
00:07:19.851 --> 00:07:23.270
superpower of the world's ever known,
saying things like clean coal,

137
00:07:23.450 --> 00:07:27.650
like clean coal.
What do you,
what do you think?
Okay,
so someone comes to visit us,

138
00:07:27.651 --> 00:07:29.690
right?
What's the dumbest thing that they're going to notice?

139
00:07:29.691 --> 00:07:32.410
The first you can say,
Oh wow,
this is the dumbest thing you've ever said.

140
00:07:32.411 --> 00:07:35.030
What's the number one thing you visit our planet?

141
00:07:35.300 --> 00:07:38.170
The number one dumbest thing they're going to see him till I think the

142
00:07:38.230 --> 00:07:39.740
pollutions,
the number one dumbest,

143
00:07:39.770 --> 00:07:44.210
like you guys are shitting in the environment that you need to sustain you all

144
00:07:44.220 --> 00:07:46.940
right?
You're,
you're,
and you're doing this in,

145
00:07:47.060 --> 00:07:50.850
it's not like you don't have the resources to fix that infinite money.
Yeah,

146
00:07:50.851 --> 00:07:52.790
and we have incredible amounts of money,

147
00:07:52.791 --> 00:07:55.100
but yet the money's not going towards that.

148
00:07:55.460 --> 00:08:00.460
Massive resources should be going to removing carbon from the atmosphere.

149
00:08:00.531 --> 00:08:03.130
Removing particulates from the atmosphere.
Yeah.

150
00:08:03.160 --> 00:08:07.190
Like brake dust and all the shit that's in these cities and these cars are

151
00:08:07.191 --> 00:08:09.400
constantly slamming on their brakes.
That dusty,

152
00:08:09.410 --> 00:08:12.650
you have to clean off your wheels.
That shit's everywhere,
right.
Then your lungs,

153
00:08:12.651 --> 00:08:15.710
baby,
it's fucking everywhere.
Yeah,
and takes years off people's lives.

154
00:08:15.711 --> 00:08:18.560
It absolutely does.
They would look at all that.
They would go,
go,

155
00:08:18.561 --> 00:08:20.870
why aren't they looking at that?
Like,
why aren't they,

156
00:08:20.990 --> 00:08:25.300
why don't they have some sort of system in place to mitigate all the problems

157
00:08:25.301 --> 00:08:29.630
I've created in terms of like,
oh,
I mean,
oh,
they got rid of plastic straws,
right?

158
00:08:29.630 --> 00:08:32.840
Yeah.
Keep,
keep the caps though.
Keep the bottle to find,

159
00:08:32.841 --> 00:08:37.350
keep tabs that you pull off of things.
Keep plastic wrap.

160
00:08:37.520 --> 00:08:40.340
Everything's plastic.
I think of those new disintegrating straws,
by the way.

161
00:08:40.670 --> 00:08:44.900
Ridiculous.
It's like I want to keep around.
What a stainless steel we'll should,

162
00:08:44.901 --> 00:08:48.110
but you have to clean it though.
So that same thing you can call stab somebody.

163
00:08:48.111 --> 00:08:51.030
If somebody attacks you can get one with a sharp,
Sharp,
pointy end.
Yeah.
Oh,

164
00:08:51.031 --> 00:08:53.120
I'm sorry that I stabbed this feral punch a hole through them.

165
00:08:53.121 --> 00:08:58.080
Like that walking dead crossbow.
Yeah.
Yeah.
I think,

166
00:08:58.081 --> 00:09:02.010
um,
that's the big one that we would,
that they would get,
they would go,
wow,

167
00:09:02.011 --> 00:09:02.844
these people are crazy.

168
00:09:02.940 --> 00:09:04.920
The other thing they would say is the nuclear power thing.

169
00:09:04.921 --> 00:09:08.070
Like when you find out things like the Fukushima plant,
they didn't have,
uh,

170
00:09:08.520 --> 00:09:11.700
any sort of backup plan to shut the hell up.
Shut it down.
Yeah.

171
00:09:11.880 --> 00:09:14.490
Like you don't know what happens if your generator goes out.
Oh,

172
00:09:14.550 --> 00:09:18.360
well we're fucked.
No,
it's nothing really clear.
Meltdown.
Everything dies forever.

173
00:09:18.390 --> 00:09:21.660
Yeah.
Yeah.
They didn't plan on that like that.
The fact that we,

174
00:09:21.750 --> 00:09:25.290
they built these plants and they have no idea how to shut them off.

175
00:09:25.291 --> 00:09:27.570
Like that's crazy.
Yeah.
The aliens would probably like,

176
00:09:27.571 --> 00:09:28.560
these people are their fucking mind.

177
00:09:28.561 --> 00:09:30.930
They're smart enough to figure out how to harness nuclear power,

178
00:09:31.140 --> 00:09:35.350
but what they use it for is to generate steam.
Yeah.
Constant.
And it,

179
00:09:35.351 --> 00:09:38.190
and it has to stay on forever.
That's why they put him near the oceans.

180
00:09:38.191 --> 00:09:39.210
Like these cats are assholes.
