00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.240
Alright I'm here with Clay

00:00:01.240 --> 00:00:02.540
We're here in Jordanâ€“Hare Stadium before the game

00:00:02.580 --> 00:00:05.100
You can see they're painting the lines for the Iron Bowl

00:00:05.120 --> 00:00:05.920
Check it out

00:00:06.560 --> 00:00:09.820
They're not the only people that have to get ready for the Iron Bowl

00:00:09.820 --> 00:00:10.700
AH! The bird!

00:00:11.080 --> 00:00:12.620
The eagle slapped me

00:00:17.220 --> 00:00:19.020
I've been slapped several times by this eagle

00:00:19.020 --> 00:00:21.000
because I'm wearing crimson, and it doesn't like it

00:00:21.360 --> 00:00:22.080
Roll Tide!

00:00:22.240 --> 00:00:22.960
Right?

00:00:22.960 --> 00:00:23.680
War Eagle!

00:00:23.680 --> 00:00:24.400
Whatever!
