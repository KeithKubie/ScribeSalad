00:02:29.250 --> 00:02:31.820 align:start position:0%
able to crown this with our last one
like<00:02:29.640><c> that</c><00:02:29.670><c> so</c><00:02:30.180><c> we</c><00:02:30.269><c> get</c><00:02:30.420><c> a</c><00:02:30.450><c> square</c><00:02:30.989><c> pyramid</c><00:02:31.560><c> so</c>

00:02:31.820 --> 00:02:31.830 align:start position:0%
like that so we get a square pyramid so
 

00:02:31.830 --> 00:02:33.199 align:start position:0%
like that so we get a square pyramid so
that's<00:02:31.980><c> another</c><00:02:32.190><c> way</c><00:02:32.370><c> of</c><00:02:32.400><c> doing</c><00:02:32.670><c> it</c><00:02:33.000><c> perhaps</c>

00:02:33.199 --> 00:02:33.209 align:start position:0%

00:02:34.550 --> 00:02:34.560 align:start position:0%
another obvious one would be with a

another obvious one would be with a

00:02:36.410 --> 00:02:36.420 align:start position:0%

00:02:36.420 --> 00:02:37.880 align:start position:0%
hexagonal base so we'll get a look at
that<00:02:36.480><c> too</c><00:02:36.810><c> so</c><00:02:36.989><c> let's</c><00:02:37.110><c> try</c><00:02:37.349><c> and</c><00:02:37.500><c> make</c><00:02:37.650><c> a</c>

00:02:37.880 --> 00:02:37.890 align:start position:0%
that too so let's try and make a
 

00:02:37.890 --> 00:02:39.380 align:start position:0%
that too so let's try and make a

00:02:39.380 --> 00:02:39.390 align:start position:0%

00:02:39.390 --> 00:02:41.150 align:start position:0%

00:02:41.150 --> 00:02:41.160 align:start position:0%
central one there let's make a hexagon
 

00:02:41.160 --> 00:02:44.300 align:start position:0%
central one there let's make a hexagon

00:02:44.300 --> 00:02:44.310 align:start position:0%

00:02:44.310 --> 00:02:45.949 align:start position:0%
around the center and then for the next
layer<00:02:44.489><c> we</c><00:02:44.760><c> would</c><00:02:44.910><c> fill</c><00:02:45.209><c> in</c><00:02:45.390><c> those</c><00:02:45.540><c> obvious</c>

00:02:45.949 --> 00:02:45.959 align:start position:0%

00:02:45.959 --> 00:02:48.589 align:start position:0%
layer we would fill in those obvious

00:02:48.589 --> 00:02:48.599 align:start position:0%

00:02:48.599 --> 00:02:52.670 align:start position:0%

perhaps<00:02:49.069><c> one</c><00:02:50.069><c> there</c><00:02:50.400><c> perhaps</c><00:02:51.380><c> let's</c><00:02:52.380><c> do</c><00:02:52.500><c> one</c>

00:02:52.670 --> 00:02:52.680 align:start position:0%
perhaps one there perhaps let's do one
 

00:02:52.680 --> 00:02:55.160 align:start position:0%
perhaps one there perhaps let's do one
there<00:02:53.180><c> and</c><00:02:54.180><c> I</c><00:02:54.299><c> could</c><00:02:54.450><c> crown</c><00:02:54.630><c> this</c><00:02:54.840><c> off</c><00:02:54.989><c> with</c>

00:02:55.160 --> 00:02:55.170 align:start position:0%

give you the whole packing so now I want
 

00:04:58.890 --> 00:05:00.470 align:start position:0%
give you the whole packing so now I want

sphere we've got half a sphere from the

00:05:11.000 --> 00:05:11.010 align:start position:0%
top and then from the bottom layer I'll
 

00:05:11.010 --> 00:05:12.680 align:start position:0%
top and then from the bottom layer I'll
cut<00:05:11.250><c> it</c><00:05:11.340><c> in</c><00:05:11.460><c> half</c><00:05:11.700><c> and</c><00:05:12.090><c> then</c><00:05:12.240><c> I</c><00:05:12.300><c> cut</c><00:05:12.510><c> it</c><00:05:12.540><c> in</c>

00:05:12.680 --> 00:05:12.690 align:start position:0%
cut it in half and then I cut it in
 

00:05:12.690 --> 00:05:16.250 align:start position:0%
cut it in half and then I cut it in
quarters<00:05:12.960><c> so</c><00:05:13.890><c> I've</c><00:05:14.010><c> got</c><00:05:14.160><c> four</c><00:05:14.520><c> eighths</c><00:05:14.940><c> of</c><00:05:15.660><c> a</c>

00:05:16.250 --> 00:05:16.260 align:start position:0%
quarters so I've got four eighths of a
 

00:05:16.260 --> 00:05:18.740 align:start position:0%
quarters so I've got four eighths of a
sphere<00:05:16.530><c> so</c><00:05:17.160><c> altogether</c><00:05:17.520><c> that</c><00:05:18.420><c> would</c><00:05:18.540><c> make</c><00:05:18.720><c> one</c>

00:05:18.740 --> 00:05:18.750 align:start position:0%
sphere so altogether that would make one
 

00:05:18.750 --> 00:05:21.050 align:start position:0%
sphere so altogether that would make one
complete<00:05:19.500><c> sphere</c><00:05:19.710><c> so</c><00:05:20.130><c> what</c><00:05:20.310><c> is</c><00:05:20.400><c> the</c><00:05:20.520><c> volume</c><00:05:20.910><c> of</c>

00:05:21.050 --> 00:05:21.060 align:start position:0%
complete sphere so what is the volume of
 

00:05:21.060 --> 00:05:23.360 align:start position:0%
complete sphere so what is the volume of
one<00:05:21.480><c> sphere</c><00:05:21.960><c> well</c><00:05:22.530><c> there's</c><00:05:22.710><c> a</c><00:05:22.770><c> formula</c><00:05:23.250><c> for</c>

00:05:23.360 --> 00:05:23.370 align:start position:0%
one sphere well there's a formula for
 

00:05:23.370 --> 00:05:28.370 align:start position:0%
one sphere well there's a formula for
that<00:05:23.550><c> so</c><00:05:23.970><c> that</c><00:05:24.270><c> is</c><00:05:24.480><c> 4</c><00:05:24.990><c> PI</c><00:05:25.530><c> over</c><00:05:26.190><c> 3</c><00:05:26.490><c> well</c><00:05:27.300><c> R</c><00:05:27.720><c> cubed</c>

00:05:28.370 --> 00:05:28.380 align:start position:0%
that so that is 4 PI over 3 well R cubed
 

00:05:28.380 --> 00:05:30.200 align:start position:0%
that so that is 4 PI over 3 well R cubed
but<00:05:28.680><c> let's</c><00:05:28.830><c> just</c><00:05:28.980><c> say</c><00:05:29.220><c> it</c><00:05:29.340><c> has</c><00:05:29.490><c> radius</c><00:05:29.910><c> 1</c>

00:05:30.200 --> 00:05:30.210 align:start position:0%
but let's just say it has radius 1
 

00:05:30.210 --> 00:05:32.240 align:start position:0%
but let's just say it has radius 1
because<00:05:30.540><c> there's</c><00:05:30.690><c> no</c><00:05:30.810><c> reason</c><00:05:31.170><c> why</c><00:05:31.350><c> not</c><00:05:31.380><c> so</c><00:05:31.920><c> I'm</c>

00:05:32.240 --> 00:05:32.250 align:start position:0%
because there's no reason why not so I'm
 

00:05:32.250 --> 00:05:34.460 align:start position:0%
because there's no reason why not so I'm
just<00:05:32.370><c> going</c><00:05:32.490><c> to</c><00:05:32.550><c> say</c><00:05:32.700><c> it's</c><00:05:32.820><c> 4</c><00:05:33.030><c> PI</c><00:05:33.300><c> over</c><00:05:34.110><c> 3</c><00:05:34.440><c> so</c>

00:05:34.460 --> 00:05:34.470 align:start position:0%
just going to say it's 4 PI over 3 so
 

00:05:34.470 --> 00:05:36.680 align:start position:0%
just going to say it's 4 PI over 3 so
that'd<00:05:34.770><c> be</c><00:05:34.920><c> the</c><00:05:35.040><c> volume</c><00:05:35.280><c> of</c><00:05:35.700><c> the</c><00:05:35.910><c> sphere</c><00:05:35.970><c> now</c>

00:05:36.680 --> 00:05:36.690 align:start position:0%
that'd be the volume of the sphere now
 

00:05:36.690 --> 00:05:38.780 align:start position:0%
that'd be the volume of the sphere now
the<00:05:36.750><c> box</c><00:05:37.140><c> that</c><00:05:37.320><c> I've</c><00:05:37.470><c> made</c><00:05:37.800><c> well</c><00:05:38.250><c> we've</c><00:05:38.490><c> cut</c><00:05:38.760><c> it</c>

00:05:38.780 --> 00:05:38.790 align:start position:0%
the box that I've made well we've cut it
 

00:05:38.790 --> 00:05:41.120 align:start position:0%
the box that I've made well we've cut it

00:05:41.120 --> 00:05:41.130 align:start position:0%
across and vertically and so on it would
 

00:05:41.130 --> 00:05:44.270 align:start position:0%

00:05:44.270 --> 00:05:44.280 align:start position:0%
have a base of 2 by 2 so it'd be an area

have a base of 2 by 2 so it'd be an area

00:05:48.050 --> 00:05:48.060 align:start position:0%
with a bit of Pythagoras you can work

with a bit of Pythagoras you can work

00:05:50.420 --> 00:05:50.430 align:start position:0%
out that the height is root 2 so the box
 

00:05:50.430 --> 00:05:54.080 align:start position:0%
out that the height is root 2 so the box

00:06:30.120 --> 00:06:30.830 align:start position:0%
would be the best way of doing it I

00:06:30.830 --> 00:06:30.840 align:start position:0%
think so
 

00:06:30.840 --> 00:06:33.080 align:start position:0%
think so
I<00:06:30.870><c> think</c><00:06:31.380><c> it's</c><00:06:31.530><c> obviously</c><00:06:31.950><c> the</c><00:06:32.610><c> most</c><00:06:32.820><c> dense</c>

00:06:33.080 --> 00:06:33.090 align:start position:0%
I think it's obviously the most dense
 

00:06:33.090 --> 00:06:36.230 align:start position:0%
I think it's obviously the most dense

00:07:01.399 --> 00:07:01.409 align:start position:0%
always the best so maybe there's an

00:07:03.409 --> 00:07:03.419 align:start position:0%
irregular packing that would be better

if you make a structured packing like
