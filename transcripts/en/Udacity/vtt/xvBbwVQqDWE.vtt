A responsive website, changes based
on the characteristics of the device.

00:00:04.530 --> 00:00:06.600
This means, that your responsive site,

00:00:06.600 --> 00:00:09.920
needs to apply different styles,
for different devices.

00:00:10.930 --> 00:00:14.150
There are few ways to
selectively apply CSS.

00:00:14.150 --> 00:00:17.010
The easiest, is with media queries.

00:00:17.010 --> 00:00:19.470
Media queries, provide easy logic for

00:00:19.470 --> 00:00:23.100
applying different styles depending
on device characteristics.

00:00:23.100 --> 00:00:28.170

or device pixel ratio.

You can change everything,

00:00:29.510 --> 00:00:33.830
from background images to restructuring
the site's layout and even more.

00:00:33.830 --> 00:00:36.070

sheet in your page, with a media query.

00:00:40.540 --> 00:00:41.460
Let me show you how to write one.
