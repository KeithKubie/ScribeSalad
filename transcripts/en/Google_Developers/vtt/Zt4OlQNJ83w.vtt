00:00:02.757 --> 00:00:04.090
LAURENCE MORONEY: Hi, everybody.

00:00:04.090 --> 00:00:05.881
Laurence Moroney from
"The Developer Show."

00:00:05.881 --> 00:00:07.720
I'm at the TensorFlow
Developer Summit.

00:00:07.720 --> 00:00:09.110
And I'm chatting with Rajat.

00:00:09.110 --> 00:00:11.380
Rajat gave part of the
keynote that we had today.

00:00:11.380 --> 00:00:13.030
And you spoke a lot
about TensorFlow

00:00:13.030 --> 00:00:14.620
and how it's growing so quickly.

00:00:14.620 --> 00:00:16.180
Could you tell us all about it?

00:00:16.180 --> 00:00:16.930
RAJAT: Sure.

00:00:16.930 --> 00:00:18.010
I'm excited.

00:00:18.010 --> 00:00:22.600
All the way back from the Middle
East in 2015, it was exciting.

00:00:22.600 --> 00:00:24.640
So when we released
this, we were

00:00:24.640 --> 00:00:27.460
hoping to really push forward
the research community

00:00:27.460 --> 00:00:28.909
and push ML research.

00:00:28.909 --> 00:00:30.700
And that's happened,
and that's been great.

00:00:30.700 --> 00:00:32.080
That's awesome to see.

00:00:32.080 --> 00:00:33.610
But in addition to
that, we've also

00:00:33.610 --> 00:00:36.910
seen this huge inflow of
developers who started

00:00:36.910 --> 00:00:38.170
to get on machine learning.

00:00:38.170 --> 00:00:39.910
And TensorFlow has
made that easier.

00:00:39.910 --> 00:00:42.590
And you see some of that in
the numbers and so on as well.

00:00:42.590 --> 00:00:43.670
LAURENCE MORONEY: So
before you released it,

00:00:43.670 --> 00:00:45.128
did you think it
would be this big?

00:00:47.650 --> 00:00:49.635
RAJAT: To be honest, no--

00:00:49.635 --> 00:00:51.090
in short.

00:00:51.090 --> 00:00:54.790
We did think there was room
for us to make a difference.

00:00:54.790 --> 00:00:57.280
And we did think it
would have an impact.

00:00:57.280 --> 00:00:58.739
But this has been
huge and amazing.

00:00:58.739 --> 00:01:00.363
LAURENCE MORONEY:
And one of the things

00:01:00.363 --> 00:01:02.020
you showed during
your talk was a map

00:01:02.020 --> 00:01:05.890
of the world with all these
dots of people using TensorFlow.

00:01:05.890 --> 00:01:07.120
Isn't it incredible?

00:01:07.120 --> 00:01:08.570
RAJAT: It's amazing.

00:01:08.570 --> 00:01:12.100
It really highlighted
where all across the world

00:01:12.100 --> 00:01:13.180
we're using TensorFlow.

00:01:13.180 --> 00:01:15.840
So there were folks all the
way north in the Arctic Circle,

00:01:15.840 --> 00:01:17.930
in Tromso, and all the
way south to Antarctica,

00:01:17.930 --> 00:01:18.800
Deception Island.

00:01:18.800 --> 00:01:19.800
LAURENCE MORONEY: Right.

00:01:19.800 --> 00:01:20.870
RAJAT: That was really amazing.

00:01:20.870 --> 00:01:21.940
LAURENCE MORONEY: And I
think you said somebody

00:01:21.940 --> 00:01:23.390
in every time zone as well.

00:01:23.390 --> 00:01:24.070
RAJAT: Exactly.

00:01:24.070 --> 00:01:26.170
So pretty much north to
south, left to right,

00:01:26.170 --> 00:01:28.720
go across the world-- every
single place in the world.

00:01:28.720 --> 00:01:29.760
LAURENCE MORONEY:
But this was people

00:01:29.760 --> 00:01:31.120
who had starred it in GitHub.

00:01:31.120 --> 00:01:32.890
But it's not just
people starring, right?

00:01:32.890 --> 00:01:34.960
There's how many
thousand contributors?

00:01:34.960 --> 00:01:36.040
RAJAT: 30,000 commits.

00:01:36.040 --> 00:01:38.340
So lots of updates
happening to TensorFlow,

00:01:38.340 --> 00:01:40.325
with over 1,400 contributors.

00:01:40.325 --> 00:01:41.200
LAURENCE MORONEY: OK.

00:01:41.200 --> 00:01:41.560
RAJAT: Right.

00:01:41.560 --> 00:01:44.170
And more than 1,000 of those are
actually from outside Google.

00:01:44.170 --> 00:01:45.930
So lots of community
involvement there.

00:01:45.930 --> 00:01:47.530
LAURENCE MORONEY: So the
majority is outside Google?

00:01:47.530 --> 00:01:48.415
RAJAT: Exactly.

00:01:48.415 --> 00:01:49.331
LAURENCE MORONEY: Wow.

00:01:49.331 --> 00:01:51.390
So any contributors
that come to mind?

00:01:51.390 --> 00:01:54.320
Any that have done
amazing things?

00:01:54.320 --> 00:01:56.530
RAJAT: So a number
of groups have

00:01:56.530 --> 00:01:58.104
supported different
kinds of hardware

00:01:58.104 --> 00:02:00.270
and different kinds of
platforms that they run with.

00:02:00.270 --> 00:02:03.800
So one example is folks in
other companies, two or three

00:02:03.800 --> 00:02:05.050
different companies, in fact--

00:02:05.050 --> 00:02:09.320
Uber, Baidu-- and others have
contributed networking stuff.

00:02:09.320 --> 00:02:12.280
So really how TensorFlow
shine on different kinds

00:02:12.280 --> 00:02:13.962
of distributed systems as well.

00:02:13.962 --> 00:02:14.920
LAURENCE MORONEY: Nice.

00:02:14.920 --> 00:02:16.878
So it's not just small
people in the community.

00:02:16.878 --> 00:02:19.150
It's big companies in the
community, all contributing.

00:02:19.150 --> 00:02:19.600
RAJAT: Exactly.

00:02:19.600 --> 00:02:20.200
LAURENCE MORONEY:
And then anybody

00:02:20.200 --> 00:02:21.340
can take advantage
of that work, right?

00:02:21.340 --> 00:02:21.730
RAJAT: Exactly.

00:02:21.730 --> 00:02:23.770
LAURENCE MORONEY: Because
it's all open sourced.

00:02:23.770 --> 00:02:24.867
And I have to say--

00:02:24.867 --> 00:02:25.450
little things.

00:02:25.450 --> 00:02:27.330
I made my first
contribution just last week.

00:02:27.330 --> 00:02:28.510
RAJAT: Awesome.

00:02:28.510 --> 00:02:29.885
LAURENCE MORONEY:
Yeah, there was

00:02:29.885 --> 00:02:32.220
a little bug in the readme
for tfFlight that I saw.

00:02:32.220 --> 00:02:35.500
And the process of contributing
was actually very, very easy.

00:02:35.500 --> 00:02:36.370
RAJAT: Absolutely.

00:02:36.370 --> 00:02:37.060
That's our goal.

00:02:37.060 --> 00:02:39.190
We love the community
participation,

00:02:39.190 --> 00:02:40.760
and we are making
it even easier.

00:02:40.760 --> 00:02:42.760
LAURENCE MORONEY: What
would you do to encourage

00:02:42.760 --> 00:02:45.440
developers to get involved?

00:02:45.440 --> 00:02:46.960
What would you ask
developers to do

00:02:46.960 --> 00:02:49.942
to get involved, to contribute,
or any of those kind of things?

00:02:49.942 --> 00:02:51.400
RAJAT: So there
are lots of things.

00:02:51.400 --> 00:02:54.070
There are issues on GitHub
that you can look at.

00:02:54.070 --> 00:02:57.286
There are lots of them
that you can start with.

00:02:57.286 --> 00:02:58.660
Let's say you're
using TensorFlow

00:02:58.660 --> 00:02:59.860
and you find a problem.

00:02:59.860 --> 00:03:00.970
Just go ahead and fix it.

00:03:00.970 --> 00:03:02.560
It's very easy to get started.

00:03:02.560 --> 00:03:04.620
And it can be as tiny
as a one line change

00:03:04.620 --> 00:03:06.540
to the readme, like
you were saying,

00:03:06.540 --> 00:03:09.610
or some real code changes, or
even some much bigger thing

00:03:09.610 --> 00:03:10.210
as well.

00:03:10.210 --> 00:03:11.200
All are possible.

00:03:11.200 --> 00:03:12.920
We have lots of
developers doing that.

00:03:12.920 --> 00:03:14.320
LAURENCE MORONEY: And it was
a very welcoming community.

00:03:14.320 --> 00:03:16.690
I mean, my experience was
great because somebody

00:03:16.690 --> 00:03:18.100
has to review my changes.

00:03:18.100 --> 00:03:20.266
They reviewed it, they
passed it, it got checked in.

00:03:20.266 --> 00:03:21.497
And it was a beautiful thing.

00:03:21.497 --> 00:03:22.330
RAJAT: That's great.

00:03:22.330 --> 00:03:24.017
I'm glad you had a
great experience.

00:03:24.017 --> 00:03:25.600
LAURENCE MORONEY:
And I'm sure you can

00:03:25.600 --> 00:03:26.980
have a great experience too.

00:03:26.980 --> 00:03:27.890
Just give it a shot.

00:03:27.890 --> 00:03:29.530
So thank you so much, Rajat.

00:03:29.530 --> 00:03:30.800
This has been a real pleasure.

00:03:30.800 --> 00:03:32.320
I really appreciate
everything that you've

00:03:32.320 --> 00:03:33.501
been doing to the community.

00:03:33.501 --> 00:03:35.500
And thanks, everybody,
for watching this episode

00:03:35.500 --> 00:03:36.499
of "The Developer Show."

00:03:36.499 --> 00:03:37.437
I'm Laurence Moroney.

00:03:37.437 --> 00:03:39.020
If you've any questions
for me, if you

00:03:39.020 --> 00:03:40.120
have any questions
for Rajat, just

00:03:40.120 --> 00:03:41.960
please leave them in
the comments below.

00:03:41.960 --> 00:03:42.970
Thank you.
