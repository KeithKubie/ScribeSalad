00:00:00.020 --> 00:00:02.353
(whooshing)

00:00:05.396 --> 00:00:07.896
(piano music)

00:00:09.511 --> 00:00:12.383
- [Narrator] We are the paradoxical ape,

00:00:12.383 --> 00:00:16.550
bipedal, naked, large brain,
long the master of fire,

00:00:19.327 --> 00:00:21.672
tools, and language,

00:00:21.672 --> 00:00:25.089
but still trying to understand ourselves.

00:00:25.944 --> 00:00:30.111
Aware that death is inevitable,
yet filled with optimism.

00:00:32.591 --> 00:00:34.903
We grow up slowly.

00:00:34.903 --> 00:00:37.515
We hand down knowledge.

00:00:37.515 --> 00:00:39.598
We empathize and deceive.

00:00:40.975 --> 00:00:43.812
We shape the future from
our shared understanding

00:00:43.812 --> 00:00:44.812
of the past.

00:00:46.426 --> 00:00:49.903
CARTA brings together experts
from diverse disciplines

00:00:49.903 --> 00:00:54.070
to exchange insights on who
we are and how we got here.

00:00:56.333 --> 00:01:00.073
An exploration made possible
by the generosity of humans

00:01:00.073 --> 00:01:00.906
like you.

00:01:15.340 --> 00:01:18.007
(digital tones)

00:01:34.551 --> 00:01:36.252
- I'm gonna give you a perspective,

00:01:36.252 --> 00:01:40.652
a very brief perspective on
what I think is the topic today

00:01:40.652 --> 00:01:43.465
from the vantage point of somebody

00:01:43.465 --> 00:01:47.681
who is a clinical neurologist
and a research geneticist.

00:01:47.681 --> 00:01:50.271
And so that's really
where I'm coming from.

00:01:50.271 --> 00:01:54.288
And hopefully this idea of
a continuum will make sense

00:01:54.288 --> 00:01:56.233
as I go through.

00:01:56.233 --> 00:01:59.094
So two themes that I'd like to present

00:01:59.094 --> 00:02:02.064
and discuss, human disorders of cognition

00:02:02.064 --> 00:02:05.101
and behavior are part of
normal human variation,

00:02:05.101 --> 00:02:07.442
in other words the human condition.

00:02:07.442 --> 00:02:09.311
And to understand human brain function,

00:02:09.311 --> 00:02:11.935
we must understand the
individual variability.

00:02:11.935 --> 00:02:13.897
That's the key.

00:02:13.897 --> 00:02:17.227
So from a geneticist's standpoint,

00:02:17.227 --> 00:02:18.495
this says, for those
of you who can't read,

00:02:18.495 --> 00:02:20.636
"Because my genetic
programming prevents me

00:02:20.636 --> 00:02:23.676
"from stopping to ask
directions, that's why."

00:02:23.676 --> 00:02:25.553
Now, so those of you who have been

00:02:25.553 --> 00:02:28.032
in that situation before,
you can't blame your spouse.

00:02:28.032 --> 00:02:30.365
This is genetic programming.

00:02:31.219 --> 00:02:33.210
No, of course we know
that that's not true,

00:02:33.210 --> 00:02:36.705
that behavior is a combination
of genes and the environment,

00:02:36.705 --> 00:02:39.294
but genes play kind of a considerable role

00:02:39.294 --> 00:02:41.505
in all of behavior as I'll
discuss really briefly

00:02:41.505 --> 00:02:44.809
as well as brain structure and function,

00:02:44.809 --> 00:02:46.611
which is what underlies our behavior.

00:02:46.611 --> 00:02:50.851
It's the organ that is
essential for behavior.

00:02:50.851 --> 00:02:53.113
So, neuropsychiatric disorders

00:02:53.113 --> 00:02:56.249
are also highly heritable,
and so I'm just showing here

00:02:56.249 --> 00:02:59.547
in A how prevalent many
of these disorders are,

00:02:59.547 --> 00:03:01.626
even in the rarest like
Tourette's Syndrome

00:03:01.626 --> 00:03:03.832
is close to a percent in the population.

00:03:03.832 --> 00:03:05.631
Schizophrenia, about a percent.

00:03:05.631 --> 00:03:07.161
Autism, a little more than a percent

00:03:07.161 --> 00:03:11.328
all the way up to anxiety,
which is about 30% of general.

00:03:12.765 --> 00:03:15.070
But if you look at the
calculated heritability,

00:03:15.070 --> 00:03:17.775
which is just an estimate
from twin and family studies,

00:03:17.775 --> 00:03:20.885
all of these disorders have
very substantial heritability.

00:03:20.885 --> 00:03:23.509
And on some of them, the
error bars are quite large,

00:03:23.509 --> 00:03:24.694
but they range...

00:03:24.694 --> 00:03:26.268
None of them are less than 40%

00:03:26.268 --> 00:03:28.700
and many of them are over 80%.

00:03:28.700 --> 00:03:31.590
So we really have a group of
highly-heritable disorders

00:03:31.590 --> 00:03:34.900
and the question is where
does that come from?

00:03:34.900 --> 00:03:37.742
So, again, as a
neuroscientist and neurologist

00:03:37.742 --> 00:03:40.871
as well as a geneticist, genes interact

00:03:40.871 --> 00:03:42.665
with the environment during development

00:03:42.665 --> 00:03:44.785
to lead to the cerebral structure.

00:03:44.785 --> 00:03:46.943
Now, structure is not a static structure,

00:03:46.943 --> 00:03:49.528
this is a very highly dynamic structure.

00:03:49.528 --> 00:03:51.337
So we have what we can
see, what you can see

00:03:51.337 --> 00:03:53.315
with imaging or other tools.

00:03:53.315 --> 00:03:55.660
You have microscopic
anatomy, but you also have

00:03:55.660 --> 00:03:58.860
chemical and molecular
plasticity that's ongoing

00:03:58.860 --> 00:04:01.391
virtually constantly as you're listening

00:04:01.391 --> 00:04:03.614
to this, it's ongoing.

00:04:03.614 --> 00:04:06.859
So, and of course that is what
underlies cognitive function.

00:04:06.859 --> 00:04:10.566
And of course it's not a unidirectional.

00:04:10.566 --> 00:04:13.494
Development occurs over
time and cognitive function

00:04:13.494 --> 00:04:16.308
and behavior feeds back
on brain structure,

00:04:16.308 --> 00:04:19.164
so there's a constant
iteration of the brain

00:04:19.164 --> 00:04:22.794
as we develop and as we're
exposed to the environment.

00:04:22.794 --> 00:04:26.033
Now, of course, as we all look around,

00:04:26.033 --> 00:04:28.210
we can see each other and
we're all highly variable.

00:04:28.210 --> 00:04:29.531
We're all individuals.

00:04:29.531 --> 00:04:32.305
We look at each other, we should
be able to tell each other

00:04:32.305 --> 00:04:35.260
all apart from each
other most of the time.

00:04:35.260 --> 00:04:37.611
And so the same thing with the brain.

00:04:37.611 --> 00:04:40.856
There's an enormous amount
of variability in the brain,

00:04:40.856 --> 00:04:43.763
and here is just one
example of that that I found

00:04:43.763 --> 00:04:47.019
quite interesting from Lawrence Binder.

00:04:47.019 --> 00:04:51.102
This is the IQ test, or
it's one of the IQ tests.

00:04:52.002 --> 00:04:53.481
Forgive me, I'm not a psychologist,

00:04:53.481 --> 00:04:54.949
so I'm just presenting this.

00:04:54.949 --> 00:04:57.556
So this is from a paper that he did.

00:04:57.556 --> 00:05:01.491
And basically, if you go
up to 11 or 14 sub-tests

00:05:01.491 --> 00:05:04.796
on these different domains that make up IQ

00:05:04.796 --> 00:05:08.411
and look at the percentage
of people who score,

00:05:08.411 --> 00:05:12.218
these are normal people who
score in the abnormal range

00:05:12.218 --> 00:05:14.718
on at least one test, it's 71.

00:05:15.731 --> 00:05:19.122
And if you go to 14,
the more test 82% score

00:05:19.122 --> 00:05:20.208
in the abnormal range.

00:05:20.208 --> 00:05:22.193
And if you look at three
standard deviations,

00:05:22.193 --> 00:05:25.251
which is really considerably...

00:05:25.251 --> 00:05:28.642
Would be called abnormal in
psychoeducational testing,

00:05:28.642 --> 00:05:32.425
it's almost a quarter when
you're doing 14 sub-tests.

00:05:32.425 --> 00:05:33.441
So what does that mean?

00:05:33.441 --> 00:05:34.755
We all have strengths and weaknesses.

00:05:34.755 --> 00:05:37.066
We kind of know that, but
we don't act that way.

00:05:37.066 --> 00:05:39.016
Our educational system
doesn't work that way

00:05:39.016 --> 00:05:43.091
and a lot of times that we even
discuss our own colleagues,

00:05:43.091 --> 00:05:44.924
we don't act that way.

00:05:48.519 --> 00:05:51.726
So here's another point
is that if you look

00:05:51.726 --> 00:05:53.119
at functional brain networks,

00:05:53.119 --> 00:05:55.279
which are just kind of color-coded here,

00:05:55.279 --> 00:05:56.956
things that are interconnected
with each other.

00:05:56.956 --> 00:05:59.241
No brain area really acts alone,

00:05:59.241 --> 00:06:01.105
they're connected in networks.

00:06:01.105 --> 00:06:04.149
But if we look at a map of
inter-subject variability,

00:06:04.149 --> 00:06:07.968
red being very high, we
can see that the areas

00:06:07.968 --> 00:06:11.223
of highest inter-subject
variability are those areas

00:06:11.223 --> 00:06:13.723
that are the most multi-modal,

00:06:16.856 --> 00:06:20.031
called heteromodal association cortices,

00:06:20.031 --> 00:06:21.759
these are not the
regions that are involved

00:06:21.759 --> 00:06:25.917
in primary sensation like vision
or touch or motor function.

00:06:25.917 --> 00:06:28.314
These are the places where thoughts come

00:06:28.314 --> 00:06:31.662
and the environment is integrated.

00:06:31.662 --> 00:06:35.343
So that's really a critical
issue is that the things,

00:06:35.343 --> 00:06:37.705
like the frontal lobe and other circuits

00:06:37.705 --> 00:06:41.165
that really make us who
we are allow us to plan

00:06:41.165 --> 00:06:42.636
and really account for a lot

00:06:42.636 --> 00:06:44.888
of our uniquely human characteristics

00:06:44.888 --> 00:06:47.638
are the most variable between us.

00:06:49.590 --> 00:06:51.166
And of course, I mentioned
there's a high degree

00:06:51.166 --> 00:06:53.880
of variability, there's also
a high degree of heritability.

00:06:53.880 --> 00:06:57.061
And this is, again, my genetics viewpoint.

00:06:57.061 --> 00:06:59.238
Not deterministic, please
don't get that idea,

00:06:59.238 --> 00:07:00.071
but there are two twins.

00:07:00.071 --> 00:07:04.207
I just find this picture
so unbelievably cute.

00:07:04.207 --> 00:07:06.175
Much cuter than the identical twin brains,

00:07:06.175 --> 00:07:09.936
but the point here is
that identical twin brains

00:07:09.936 --> 00:07:13.406
are also highly similar,
just like twins look similar

00:07:13.406 --> 00:07:16.310
on the outside, the brain,
the structure, the function,

00:07:16.310 --> 00:07:17.878
highly, highly similar.

00:07:17.878 --> 00:07:20.455
In fact, most structures in the brain,

00:07:20.455 --> 00:07:23.845
let's start with the cerebral cortex,

00:07:23.845 --> 00:07:27.595
are around 70% to 80% heritability.

00:07:29.975 --> 00:07:32.355
And this maintains over
the lifespan, actually,

00:07:32.355 --> 00:07:34.561
so it's quite interesting.

00:07:34.561 --> 00:07:38.636
So then the question is,
I showed you that IQ test

00:07:38.636 --> 00:07:42.636
that shows that you might
have a really high IQ,

00:07:43.635 --> 00:07:45.968
but the likelihood is
you're gonna be really poor

00:07:45.968 --> 00:07:47.617
in a few areas.

00:07:47.617 --> 00:07:50.368
And so let's explore that a little bit.

00:07:50.368 --> 00:07:52.979
Is ability really uni-dimensional?

00:07:52.979 --> 00:07:56.312
So the concept of g or
general intelligence.

00:07:56.312 --> 00:07:57.426
This is highly heritable.

00:07:57.426 --> 00:07:59.266
I think its heritability is around .6

00:07:59.266 --> 00:08:03.325
and it's related to many
psychoeducational tests.

00:08:03.325 --> 00:08:05.937
Again, as a neurologist,
not as a psychologist,

00:08:05.937 --> 00:08:08.201
I look at it as things
that task working memory

00:08:08.201 --> 00:08:10.283
and frontal lobe function very strongly,

00:08:10.283 --> 00:08:12.228
but it doesn't predict many functions.

00:08:12.228 --> 00:08:16.252
You can have a very high IQ
and be bad in certain things.

00:08:16.252 --> 00:08:20.335
And therefore, again, just
like that Binder table

00:08:21.614 --> 00:08:24.501
that I showed you, we
have to be really careful

00:08:24.501 --> 00:08:28.919
when we're looking at people
to really understand strengths

00:08:28.919 --> 00:08:32.187
and weaknesses which I
think is one of the themes

00:08:32.187 --> 00:08:34.480
of the discussion that
we're gonna have today,

00:08:34.480 --> 00:08:37.563
talking about very unusual strengths.

00:08:39.905 --> 00:08:41.313
So ability is specific.

00:08:41.313 --> 00:08:42.851
I'm just gonna hammer
this in a little bit.

00:08:42.851 --> 00:08:46.207
This is, what I think, is
a spectacular chalk drawing

00:08:46.207 --> 00:08:48.987
from somebody that I don't know well

00:08:48.987 --> 00:08:50.880
but I've talked to his mother quite a bit

00:08:50.880 --> 00:08:54.148
at some times who's an autistic artist

00:08:54.148 --> 00:08:58.182
named Jonathan Lerman, who is
a really remarkable artist.

00:08:58.182 --> 00:09:00.580
And the forward to this book is written

00:09:00.580 --> 00:09:02.158
by The New York Times art critic.

00:09:02.158 --> 00:09:04.945
This is a serious artist
and I have some of his art

00:09:04.945 --> 00:09:06.327
and it's very Picasso-esque.

00:09:06.327 --> 00:09:08.683
It's absolutely brilliant,
but there are times

00:09:08.683 --> 00:09:10.576
when he's been absolutely non-verbal

00:09:10.576 --> 00:09:12.914
and really highly dysfunctional

00:09:12.914 --> 00:09:14.459
and having a lot of problems.

00:09:14.459 --> 00:09:17.536
But, you know, this is not that uncommon.

00:09:17.536 --> 00:09:19.120
Now, how about me?

00:09:19.120 --> 00:09:20.989
You know, I'm a relatively smart guy.

00:09:20.989 --> 00:09:22.343
I have a few degrees.

00:09:22.343 --> 00:09:24.032
You know I'm not up there

00:09:24.032 --> 00:09:26.240
with the people we're gonna
be talking about today.

00:09:26.240 --> 00:09:28.200
I don't have any of those qualities.

00:09:28.200 --> 00:09:30.011
I'm kind of not exceptional.

00:09:30.011 --> 00:09:32.761
I'm just a professor, but I do...

00:09:33.648 --> 00:09:37.055
No, seriously, there's
nothing exceptional about that

00:09:37.055 --> 00:09:41.222
and yet at the same time,
I've had to do well in school

00:09:42.965 --> 00:09:45.914
and that's because school
involves writing and reading

00:09:45.914 --> 00:09:48.113
and mathematics and I can do that.

00:09:48.113 --> 00:09:50.139
But this is one thing I can't do.

00:09:50.139 --> 00:09:52.056
And this is not a joke.

00:09:54.302 --> 00:09:55.687
That's my...

00:09:55.687 --> 00:09:58.696
I've been drawing like that
since I was in 3rd or 4th grade.

00:09:58.696 --> 00:10:00.250
This is the best I can do.

00:10:00.250 --> 00:10:01.330
And I'm not joking.

00:10:01.330 --> 00:10:05.295
Now it's true that
ability is a combination

00:10:05.295 --> 00:10:07.816
of genes and the environment,
so there's no question

00:10:07.816 --> 00:10:09.917
that I could probably do
better if I put my mind to it.

00:10:09.917 --> 00:10:12.051
Bruce Miller believes that I can.

00:10:12.051 --> 00:10:15.101
I've tried at times,
'cause my mom was an artist

00:10:15.101 --> 00:10:16.709
and she tried to get me to drawing stuff

00:10:16.709 --> 00:10:18.509
and I was really, really bad.

00:10:18.509 --> 00:10:19.565
But just the point I want to make

00:10:19.565 --> 00:10:22.051
is that strengths and weaknesses really...

00:10:22.051 --> 00:10:24.994
Some strengths come
together, they come in groups

00:10:24.994 --> 00:10:27.281
and we're gonna talk
about that a lot today,

00:10:27.281 --> 00:10:29.562
but the point is just because
one's strong in one area

00:10:29.562 --> 00:10:31.472
doesn't mean that you're
strong in all areas.

00:10:31.472 --> 00:10:33.394
And if we had an educational system

00:10:33.394 --> 00:10:35.443
where I had to represent the world

00:10:35.443 --> 00:10:37.636
in two or three dimensions,
I wouldn't have gotten

00:10:37.636 --> 00:10:39.886
very far, I'm sure of that.

00:10:40.810 --> 00:10:42.540
So now how does this fit into genetics?

00:10:42.540 --> 00:10:46.707
Well, this is from Wikimedia
Images, one of my main sources.

00:10:48.810 --> 00:10:50.651
We use this a lot.

00:10:50.651 --> 00:10:52.849
It's actually probably
from Daniel MacArthur.

00:10:52.849 --> 00:10:54.884
You know, it's a cartoon
from the Broad Group,

00:10:54.884 --> 00:10:58.412
but what you can see here
is this is 10,000 B.C.

00:10:58.412 --> 00:11:00.555
This is around where we are right now.

00:11:00.555 --> 00:11:03.225
This is the estimated
population in billions.

00:11:03.225 --> 00:11:06.482
And you can see that
there is an enormous arise

00:11:06.482 --> 00:11:09.714
that humans were a very small population.

00:11:09.714 --> 00:11:13.881
But we essentially have arisen
from an ancestral population

00:11:15.613 --> 00:11:17.863
more than 10,000 years ago.

00:11:19.317 --> 00:11:21.459
What's interesting is that we come

00:11:21.459 --> 00:11:23.467
from a small set of
ancestors, and that means

00:11:23.467 --> 00:11:26.800
that we share a common genetic variation

00:11:27.705 --> 00:11:31.296
that's been acted on by evolution.

00:11:31.296 --> 00:11:33.827
If those had been very deleterious,

00:11:33.827 --> 00:11:36.778
anything that's highly
deleterious would get removed

00:11:36.778 --> 00:11:39.361
after thousands of generations.

00:11:40.307 --> 00:11:42.275
So that the variation that we all share

00:11:42.275 --> 00:11:43.843
that is common genetic variation,

00:11:43.843 --> 00:11:46.755
things greater than 1% in the population,

00:11:46.755 --> 00:11:49.838
our genomes are 99.9% identical.

00:11:51.273 --> 00:11:52.962
Those things that we
share have been acted on

00:11:52.962 --> 00:11:55.819
by natural selection to
remove strong bad actors,

00:11:55.819 --> 00:11:57.627
and therefore the things that contribute

00:11:57.627 --> 00:12:00.210
to most of our human phenotypes

00:12:01.083 --> 00:12:03.684
from diabetes to human cognition,

00:12:03.684 --> 00:12:08.026
each individually, have
very small effect sizes.

00:12:08.026 --> 00:12:10.859
And so they haven't been purified.

00:12:11.713 --> 00:12:15.072
And so when we're looking for
genes that cause diseases,

00:12:15.072 --> 00:12:18.116
a lot of what's going on in
genetic association studies

00:12:18.116 --> 00:12:21.186
is we're looking for relatively
high frequency variants

00:12:21.186 --> 00:12:23.003
that are more than 1% in the population,

00:12:23.003 --> 00:12:24.987
but they have very small effect sizes,

00:12:24.987 --> 00:12:27.832
as opposed to mutation
screens that identify genes

00:12:27.832 --> 00:12:30.945
of large effect, but they're
generally much rarer.

00:12:30.945 --> 00:12:32.771
Now I'm not saying that
all human variation

00:12:32.771 --> 00:12:37.603
is due to common variation,
but a good deal of it is.

00:12:37.603 --> 00:12:40.829
And so we can begin to think,
and this is a classic behavior

00:12:40.829 --> 00:12:42.339
from a behavior genetics textbook

00:12:42.339 --> 00:12:44.377
from DeFries and Robert Plomin.

00:12:44.377 --> 00:12:47.587
Actually, the W doesn't belong there.

00:12:47.587 --> 00:12:52.037
There is part of my residual
dyslexia from childhood.

00:12:52.037 --> 00:12:53.938
But complex diseases and disorders

00:12:53.938 --> 00:12:57.201
in all complex human
cognition lies on a continuum

00:12:57.201 --> 00:13:00.995
of normal variability, a
disease threshold model

00:13:00.995 --> 00:13:03.591
where we get one copy
of each gene from mom

00:13:03.591 --> 00:13:07.487
and one from dad, and
this particular variant,

00:13:07.487 --> 00:13:11.330
if you have the BB variant, you're likely

00:13:11.330 --> 00:13:14.581
to be past a threshold,
but it's not deterministic.

00:13:14.581 --> 00:13:16.450
And think about this as an additive set

00:13:16.450 --> 00:13:19.097
of normal distributions
where these variants

00:13:19.097 --> 00:13:23.602
of very small effect sizes
are adding, adding, adding up.

00:13:23.602 --> 00:13:24.977
Another point is that the threshold

00:13:24.977 --> 00:13:28.066
is somewhat arbitrary in many cases.

00:13:28.066 --> 00:13:29.184
What's high blood pressure?

00:13:29.184 --> 00:13:30.966
What's high glucose?

00:13:30.966 --> 00:13:32.877
What's bad reading?

00:13:32.877 --> 00:13:34.410
What's attention deficit disorder?

00:13:34.410 --> 00:13:35.362
Et cetera.

00:13:35.362 --> 00:13:37.992
This is all somewhat
an arbitrary threshold

00:13:37.992 --> 00:13:40.626
that's based upon
society and what usually,

00:13:40.626 --> 00:13:44.793
hopefully, what's practical
for the biomedical enterprise.

00:13:46.523 --> 00:13:49.803
So this is the kind of
foundation that took me

00:13:49.803 --> 00:13:51.650
when I started to work on autism

00:13:51.650 --> 00:13:55.332
now about 17 years ago
to think about autism

00:13:55.332 --> 00:13:58.931
as part of the continuum
of normal variation.

00:13:58.931 --> 00:14:00.171
And this is the idea.

00:14:00.171 --> 00:14:04.826
Autism diagnosis depends
upon quantitative impairment

00:14:04.826 --> 00:14:05.955
in multiple domains.

00:14:05.955 --> 00:14:06.963
It's not qualitative.

00:14:06.963 --> 00:14:07.899
We all...

00:14:07.899 --> 00:14:10.539
Some people here are really
good socially, some aren't.

00:14:10.539 --> 00:14:14.706
But to become autistic,
you have to fall out here.

00:14:17.042 --> 00:14:20.125
If you think of each of these as a contour

00:14:20.125 --> 00:14:22.115
of normal distribution where the green

00:14:22.115 --> 00:14:25.378
is highly advantageous,
really superior functioning,

00:14:25.378 --> 00:14:28.128
and the red is less than optimal.

00:14:29.111 --> 00:14:31.355
And so they have for children with autism

00:14:31.355 --> 00:14:34.038
have to have repetitive
restrictive behavior

00:14:34.038 --> 00:14:36.019
and deficits in social behavior.

00:14:36.019 --> 00:14:38.962
The diagnosis has changed
over the last five years

00:14:38.962 --> 00:14:41.306
so that language is now not
fundamentally part of it

00:14:41.306 --> 00:14:43.035
but it often is.

00:14:43.035 --> 00:14:45.986
But just the point here is that, again,

00:14:45.986 --> 00:14:48.771
a line is drawn, and you
have to have impairment

00:14:48.771 --> 00:14:51.435
in multiple domains that's
quantitative and measured

00:14:51.435 --> 00:14:53.398
so that those people that are here

00:14:53.398 --> 00:14:55.947
who might be a sibling on one area

00:14:55.947 --> 00:14:58.565
aren't autistic or if they're here.

00:14:58.565 --> 00:14:59.772
And that's arbitrary again.

00:14:59.772 --> 00:15:02.133
It's our diagnosis.

00:15:02.133 --> 00:15:03.175
Do we have proof of that?

00:15:03.175 --> 00:15:04.364
Yes, there's quite a bit of proof.

00:15:04.364 --> 00:15:06.436
I'm gonna show you one
really nice piece of data

00:15:06.436 --> 00:15:10.603
that was published recently by
Elise Robinson and Mark Daly.

00:15:11.807 --> 00:15:14.834
So social function in those without autism

00:15:14.834 --> 00:15:17.559
is strongly related to
the same genetic factors

00:15:17.559 --> 00:15:20.200
that increase autism genetic risk.

00:15:20.200 --> 00:15:21.495
What you can do is you can come up

00:15:21.495 --> 00:15:23.856
with a compositive genetic score,

00:15:23.856 --> 00:15:26.290
all these little small,
common risk variants,

00:15:26.290 --> 00:15:29.900
add them up in what's called
a polygenic risk score.

00:15:29.900 --> 00:15:32.310
And you can ask if I have that for autism,

00:15:32.310 --> 00:15:35.160
and it has about a 70% prediction

00:15:35.160 --> 00:15:37.935
for who's gonna be autistic, how well

00:15:37.935 --> 00:15:41.264
is that correlated with just autism

00:15:41.264 --> 00:15:43.792
in the normal population?

00:15:43.792 --> 00:15:45.648
And the normal population being used here

00:15:45.648 --> 00:15:49.497
is a longitudinal study of
parents and children in Avon.

00:15:49.497 --> 00:15:50.830
It's in England.

00:15:51.698 --> 00:15:53.033
It's called ALSPAC.

00:15:53.033 --> 00:15:56.040
And if you look, you can see
that the genetic correlation

00:15:56.040 --> 00:15:59.645
between the psychiatric
genetic consortium autism

00:15:59.645 --> 00:16:04.306
and a Danish autism consortium
are both close to .3.

00:16:04.306 --> 00:16:06.330
That's an enormous correlation.

00:16:06.330 --> 00:16:08.363
So that's telling us that the things that

00:16:08.363 --> 00:16:11.044
in the common variation that
we have that predisposes

00:16:11.044 --> 00:16:14.808
to autism is part of normal variation.

00:16:14.808 --> 00:16:16.077
So how about other things?

00:16:16.077 --> 00:16:18.230
And you're gonna hear
a lot more about some

00:16:18.230 --> 00:16:20.131
of these topics today,
but I just wanted to touch

00:16:20.131 --> 00:16:23.554
on them and give you a point
of view, maybe a framework.

00:16:23.554 --> 00:16:25.047
So there's something called synesthesia

00:16:25.047 --> 00:16:26.412
and this is a slide from my colleague,

00:16:26.412 --> 00:16:29.431
Simon Baron Cohen, who would've
given a much better talk

00:16:29.431 --> 00:16:33.226
than I'm giving, and
unfortunately can't be here.

00:16:33.226 --> 00:16:36.525
But stimulation of one
sensory modality automatically

00:16:36.525 --> 00:16:39.026
triggers a perception in a second.

00:16:39.026 --> 00:16:42.359
So it might be that when you see a word,

00:16:43.691 --> 00:16:46.044
you hear music with it or vice versa,

00:16:46.044 --> 00:16:48.869
when you hear music, there's
a color associated with it.

00:16:48.869 --> 00:16:50.565
It's actually present in
some degree or another

00:16:50.565 --> 00:16:52.982
in 4% of the population.

00:16:54.380 --> 00:16:57.090
It also has a strong genetic...

00:16:57.090 --> 00:17:01.149
There's evidence that
it has genetic factors.

00:17:01.149 --> 00:17:05.567
So about almost 40% have at
least one other family member

00:17:05.567 --> 00:17:07.746
with synesthesia, and
there's been some evidence

00:17:07.746 --> 00:17:09.662
of genetic linkage, even, but no genes

00:17:09.662 --> 00:17:11.734
have been identified as far as I'm aware,

00:17:11.734 --> 00:17:14.984
but maybe Simon knows, or Simon Fisher.

00:17:15.866 --> 00:17:17.905
So now I'm gonna tell you just a brief bit

00:17:17.905 --> 00:17:21.345
about somebody that Simon
Baron Cohen knows quite well,

00:17:21.345 --> 00:17:22.927
which is Daniel Tammet, and many of you

00:17:22.927 --> 00:17:25.239
may have read his book,
Born on a Blue Day.

00:17:25.239 --> 00:17:26.847
If you haven't read it, you must read it.

00:17:26.847 --> 00:17:29.898
It is an extraordinary book.

00:17:29.898 --> 00:17:32.488
If you haven't read it,
you wouldn't believe

00:17:32.488 --> 00:17:35.967
that there's somebody who can do this.

00:17:35.967 --> 00:17:38.289
But he sees numbers as shapes and colors.

00:17:38.289 --> 00:17:39.929
This Test of Genuineness is a test

00:17:39.929 --> 00:17:42.741
that is related to synesthesia.

00:17:42.741 --> 00:17:43.899
He's invented his own language.

00:17:43.899 --> 00:17:45.234
He learns languages in two weeks.

00:17:45.234 --> 00:17:47.307
I think he learned Finnish in two weeks.

00:17:47.307 --> 00:17:48.822
Perfectly.

00:17:48.822 --> 00:17:50.424
He performs mathematical calculations

00:17:50.424 --> 00:17:51.927
that you can't imagine.

00:17:51.927 --> 00:17:55.677
He is the European
champion in pi, to 22,515.

00:17:57.953 --> 00:18:00.043
And he has Asperger Syndrome.

00:18:00.043 --> 00:18:01.603
So the question is...

00:18:01.603 --> 00:18:03.647
So, okay, so that's an
interesting observation.

00:18:03.647 --> 00:18:07.309
That's a very rare, unique
individual with these features.

00:18:07.309 --> 00:18:10.108
So you can ask the question, does autism,

00:18:10.108 --> 00:18:13.005
is synesthesia increased
in people with autism?

00:18:13.005 --> 00:18:15.130
So if independent, synesthesia and autism

00:18:15.130 --> 00:18:18.432
should co-occur in four
out of 10,000 people.

00:18:18.432 --> 00:18:20.412
But they're not.

00:18:20.412 --> 00:18:22.340
Simon Baron Cohen's study
shows that it's present

00:18:22.340 --> 00:18:23.826
in almost 19%.

00:18:23.826 --> 00:18:26.140
Of course, this is done via questionnaire.

00:18:26.140 --> 00:18:28.270
So it would have to be
redone measuring it,

00:18:28.270 --> 00:18:32.437
but I think one would argue
that it's quite enriched.

00:18:33.419 --> 00:18:35.574
There's also an enrichment among those

00:18:35.574 --> 00:18:38.420
who have perfect pitch with synesthesia.

00:18:38.420 --> 00:18:40.920
In this study, about 20%.

00:18:42.217 --> 00:18:44.222
So there's a relationship
of some of the things

00:18:44.222 --> 00:18:46.356
that we're gonna be talking about today

00:18:46.356 --> 00:18:48.219
that are really extraordinary variations

00:18:48.219 --> 00:18:53.130
on the human mind, and a
common genetic variation,

00:18:53.130 --> 00:18:56.770
and what we think of as intellectual

00:18:56.770 --> 00:19:00.148
or behavioral disabilities or disorders.

00:19:00.148 --> 00:19:01.546
And so I'll leave you with one thought.

00:19:01.546 --> 00:19:03.097
What does it mean that a
feature that is present

00:19:03.097 --> 00:19:05.115
rarely in the general population

00:19:05.115 --> 00:19:07.570
is more frequent in those with a disorder?

00:19:07.570 --> 00:19:09.405
I mean, of course it means
that the human condition

00:19:09.405 --> 00:19:11.326
is one of strengths and weaknesses

00:19:11.326 --> 00:19:14.532
and that great strength can be
the flip side of disability.

00:19:14.532 --> 00:19:16.994
And in part, this is because
of the genetic contributions

00:19:16.994 --> 00:19:19.235
to evolution, to human brain evolution.

00:19:19.235 --> 00:19:22.763
That we've inherited strengths
along with weaknesses,

00:19:22.763 --> 00:19:26.129
and sometimes they lead to
what we call a disorder.

00:19:26.129 --> 00:19:28.997
And I'm gonna leave you with
another interesting thought,

00:19:28.997 --> 00:19:30.642
that if you look at the
most variable brain regions

00:19:30.642 --> 00:19:33.914
in human, there are also
those that have expanded most

00:19:33.914 --> 00:19:35.121
on the human lineage,

00:19:35.121 --> 00:19:37.164
getting back to one of my earliest slides.

00:19:37.164 --> 00:19:39.268
Again, this is from a paper
Mueller et al in Neuron

00:19:39.268 --> 00:19:41.746
in 2013, and basically if you look

00:19:41.746 --> 00:19:44.330
at the cortical surface expansion in this

00:19:44.330 --> 00:19:46.635
frontal parietal temporal lobe area

00:19:46.635 --> 00:19:47.796
and then you look at the areas

00:19:47.796 --> 00:19:50.663
with the most inter-subject
variability, there it is.

00:19:50.663 --> 00:19:53.781
And we know that cortical surface volume,

00:19:53.781 --> 00:19:56.172
especially volume, is highly heritable.

00:19:56.172 --> 00:20:01.130
So that this variability is
highly heritable as well.

00:20:01.130 --> 00:20:03.206
And you can look at this correlation.

00:20:03.206 --> 00:20:05.512
There's a strong correlation throughout,

00:20:05.512 --> 00:20:07.195
not just in my picture.

00:20:07.195 --> 00:20:10.522
So we've had 150 years
in behavioral neurology

00:20:10.522 --> 00:20:11.906
of learning from the individual,

00:20:11.906 --> 00:20:14.745
from Tan who was Broca's first patient.

00:20:14.745 --> 00:20:17.670
And from seeing two patients, he reasoned

00:20:17.670 --> 00:20:19.848
that language was in the frontal lobes.

00:20:19.848 --> 00:20:21.379
Well, maybe that was
a little too specific,

00:20:21.379 --> 00:20:23.154
Wernicke helped him out a little bit.

00:20:23.154 --> 00:20:25.746
But he reasoned that the cerebral cortex

00:20:25.746 --> 00:20:27.591
was therefore asymmetric and that language

00:20:27.591 --> 00:20:29.209
was on one side.

00:20:29.209 --> 00:20:31.846
And here's another patient, Patient HM,

00:20:31.846 --> 00:20:33.832
who was one of a series of patients

00:20:33.832 --> 00:20:36.345
who had bilateral hippocampal damage

00:20:36.345 --> 00:20:40.522
and played an important role
in our understanding of memory.

00:20:40.522 --> 00:20:43.855
So again, I wanna say that we must learn

00:20:44.937 --> 00:20:46.752
to continue to understand the nature

00:20:46.752 --> 00:20:50.201
of individual differences and how disease,

00:20:50.201 --> 00:20:53.447
what we call disease and
disorders, is really just part

00:20:53.447 --> 00:20:54.666
of the human condition.

00:20:54.666 --> 00:20:56.425
And these exceptional variations

00:20:56.425 --> 00:20:59.779
are often strongly associated
with vulnerabilities.

00:20:59.779 --> 00:21:00.625
Thank you.

00:21:00.625 --> 00:21:03.391
(applause)

00:21:03.391 --> 00:21:06.808
(pleasant digital tones)
