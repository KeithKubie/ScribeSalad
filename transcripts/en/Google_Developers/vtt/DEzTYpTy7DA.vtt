LAURENCE MORONEY: Wow,
what a great keynote.

00:00:04.150 --> 00:00:06.780
In this keynote, we saw about
how technology was being used

00:00:06.780 --> 00:00:08.090
to solve the world's problems.

00:00:08.090 --> 00:00:09.010
I'm Laurence Moroney.

00:00:09.010 --> 00:00:11.135
I'm reporting from the
Coffee with a Googler stage,

00:00:11.135 --> 00:00:12.571
here on level 2 of the Moscone.

00:00:12.571 --> 00:00:14.070
And some of the
technologies that we

00:00:14.070 --> 00:00:17.010
saw in play during the keynote
were things such as the Android

00:00:17.010 --> 00:00:18.049
M developer preview.

00:00:18.049 --> 00:00:19.590
I'm looking forward
to downloading it

00:00:19.590 --> 00:00:21.050
and trying it out for myself.

00:00:21.050 --> 00:00:23.820
We also saw updates to
things, such as Android Wear,

00:00:23.820 --> 00:00:26.170
and some fabulous stuff that's
available in the Internet

00:00:26.170 --> 00:00:29.450
of Things space, such as Project
Brillo and Project Weave.

00:00:29.450 --> 00:00:31.190
I particularly enjoyed
the Photos app,

00:00:31.190 --> 00:00:32.240
and some of the
things that we saw

00:00:32.240 --> 00:00:34.360
that are available in the
Photos app, and the fact

00:00:34.360 --> 00:00:36.350
that we can store all
of our photos and videos

00:00:36.350 --> 00:00:37.449
online for free.

00:00:37.449 --> 00:00:38.990
But I think the
crown and glory of it

00:00:38.990 --> 00:00:41.707
was the stuff that's happening
in the virtual reality space.

00:00:41.707 --> 00:00:43.790
There was the new Project
Cardboard was announced.

00:00:43.790 --> 00:00:46.120
And I see people walking around
with the new Cardboard devices

00:00:46.120 --> 00:00:46.710
now.

00:00:46.710 --> 00:00:48.126
And including that,
there was also

00:00:48.126 --> 00:00:50.510
the Project Jump, which
will allow you to film

00:00:50.510 --> 00:00:53.920
your own virtual
reality 3D videos.

00:00:53.920 --> 00:00:55.220
Just incredible stuff.

00:00:55.220 --> 00:00:57.620
And speaking of videos, we've
got this great new series

00:00:57.620 --> 00:00:59.850
that's coming on the
YouTube Developers channel.

00:00:59.850 --> 00:01:01.360
It's called Made with Android.

00:01:01.360 --> 00:01:03.650
Let's take a look at that now.

00:01:03.650 --> 00:01:06.270
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:01:12.841 --> 00:01:14.382
HEATHER BRUNDAGE:
Go, little balloon.

00:01:14.382 --> 00:01:14.882
Go.

00:01:14.882 --> 00:01:15.864
You can do it.

00:01:15.864 --> 00:01:17.840
Hey, great launch.

00:01:22.734 --> 00:01:24.650
VIMAL BHALODIA: How far
away are we from the--

00:01:24.650 --> 00:01:25.774
HEATHER BRUNDAGE: 52 miles.

00:01:25.774 --> 00:01:27.440
VIMAL BHALODIA: Oh, wow.

00:01:27.440 --> 00:01:29.240
It's still going strong.

00:01:29.240 --> 00:01:32.070
It's still pinging
regularly with locations,

00:01:32.070 --> 00:01:33.977
and that's fine.

00:01:33.977 --> 00:01:35.560
HEATHER BRUNDAGE:
My good friend Vimal

00:01:35.560 --> 00:01:38.320
is great at coming
up with crazy ideas,

00:01:38.320 --> 00:01:40.430
and I love helping
him implement them.

00:01:40.430 --> 00:01:43.480
And he told me about
his crazy, awesome idea

00:01:43.480 --> 00:01:46.310
to send cameras up
on weather balloons.

00:01:46.310 --> 00:01:47.703
And I was all in.

00:01:47.703 --> 00:01:50.714
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:01:58.395 --> 00:02:00.020
HEATHER BRUNDAGE:
I'm Heather Brundage.

00:02:00.020 --> 00:02:02.060
I'm an engineer,
an explorer, and I

00:02:02.060 --> 00:02:03.612
like to go on crazy adventures.

00:02:03.612 --> 00:02:05.070
VIMAL BHALODIA:
I'm Vimal Bhalodia.

00:02:05.070 --> 00:02:07.540
I'm a serial entrepreneur,
software engineer,

00:02:07.540 --> 00:02:09.340
and maker of random things.

00:02:09.340 --> 00:02:11.480
ALL: We're the Casa
de Balloon Club.

00:02:11.480 --> 00:02:14.630
And this is Made with Android.

00:02:14.630 --> 00:02:16.380
VIMAL BHALODIA: Launching
weather balloons

00:02:16.380 --> 00:02:18.660
is kind of an interesting
engineering challenge,

00:02:18.660 --> 00:02:20.850
plus the fact that you can
get pictures of the earth

00:02:20.850 --> 00:02:23.150
from 80,000 feet,
where you actually

00:02:23.150 --> 00:02:25.359
see the complete
blackness of the sky

00:02:25.359 --> 00:02:26.650
and the curvature of the earth.

00:02:26.650 --> 00:02:27.942
And it's absolutely incredible.

00:02:27.942 --> 00:02:29.316
HEATHER BRUNDAGE:
We used Android

00:02:29.316 --> 00:02:30.983
because it was a very
affordable device.

00:02:30.983 --> 00:02:32.649
Another reason why
we used Android is it

00:02:32.649 --> 00:02:33.816
had fantastic documentation.

00:02:33.816 --> 00:02:36.149
VIMAL BHALODIA: One of the
greatest things about Android

00:02:36.149 --> 00:02:37.890
was that it was very
easy to pick up.

00:02:37.890 --> 00:02:39.990
Literally just
downloaded the SDK,

00:02:39.990 --> 00:02:42.900
read through the first tutorial
on how to build an app,

00:02:42.900 --> 00:02:45.440
and then built the
first prototype of this

00:02:45.440 --> 00:02:46.822
all in an afternoon.

00:02:46.822 --> 00:02:48.280
Instead of using
this battery, were

00:02:48.280 --> 00:02:50.370
going to be wiring in
one of these holders.

00:02:50.370 --> 00:02:53.770
Up above 30,000 to 40,000 feet,
the normal lithium batteries

00:02:53.770 --> 00:02:56.150
that are sitting in
your phones will not

00:02:56.150 --> 00:02:59.110
work all the way up there
because they'll just freeze.

00:02:59.110 --> 00:03:01.190
We actually have to
hook our phones up

00:03:01.190 --> 00:03:02.770
to external battery
packs that are

00:03:02.770 --> 00:03:05.860
using disposable, lithium
primary batteries.

00:03:05.860 --> 00:03:07.660
I actually do all this
in my living room.

00:03:07.660 --> 00:03:09.320
I just have a little bench.

00:03:09.320 --> 00:03:12.450
And you don't really need that
much to do a project like this.

00:03:12.450 --> 00:03:14.290
HEATHER BRUNDAGE: Our
most basic payload

00:03:14.290 --> 00:03:15.890
is just an Android phone.

00:03:15.890 --> 00:03:19.390
And with that phone, we're able
to get GPS location, as well

00:03:19.390 --> 00:03:20.590
as altitude.

00:03:20.590 --> 00:03:22.770
Android allowed
us to take control

00:03:22.770 --> 00:03:24.880
of the phone in a low
level way that we needed.

00:03:24.880 --> 00:03:26.280
We're using these
phones in a way

00:03:26.280 --> 00:03:28.130
that they're not designed for.

00:03:28.130 --> 00:03:30.400
And other phones
don't let you do that.

00:03:30.400 --> 00:03:32.900
VIMAL BHALODIA: So the app that
we developed for our balloon

00:03:32.900 --> 00:03:35.610
launches is pretty much the
polar opposite of a normal,

00:03:35.610 --> 00:03:37.210
well behaved mobile app.

00:03:37.210 --> 00:03:38.950
A normal, well
behaved mobile app

00:03:38.950 --> 00:03:41.470
tries to be very careful
about power consumption.

00:03:41.470 --> 00:03:43.860
It tries to play well with
all the other apps that

00:03:43.860 --> 00:03:44.360
are running.

00:03:44.360 --> 00:03:46.360
It doesn't want
to hog resources.

00:03:46.360 --> 00:03:48.140
We want it to be
running all the time.

00:03:48.140 --> 00:03:49.640
We never want it to sleep.

00:03:49.640 --> 00:03:53.160
We want it to always be the most
important app that is running,

00:03:53.160 --> 00:03:55.580
and make sure that,
if for whatever reason

00:03:55.580 --> 00:03:57.630
the phone reboots
because of a low power

00:03:57.630 --> 00:03:59.839
situation or something, our
app comes up and running.

00:03:59.839 --> 00:04:01.255
HEATHER BRUNDAGE:
That's something

00:04:01.255 --> 00:04:04.080
that a lot of other phones don't
allow you to have access to.

00:04:04.080 --> 00:04:06.540
But Android allowed us
to have that control.

00:04:06.540 --> 00:04:08.581
VIMAL BHALODIA: And there's
our phone booting up.

00:04:08.581 --> 00:04:09.680
Good times.

00:04:09.680 --> 00:04:11.020
HEATHER BRUNDAGE: Checked the
weather for this Saturday,

00:04:11.020 --> 00:04:12.561
and it actually looks fantastic.

00:04:12.561 --> 00:04:15.060
Ahead of time, I end up doing
a lot of work on the computer.

00:04:15.060 --> 00:04:16.790
And I'm looking at
wind simulations

00:04:16.790 --> 00:04:18.690
to figure out a good
launch location,

00:04:18.690 --> 00:04:21.430
as well as expected
drop zones, checking

00:04:21.430 --> 00:04:24.720
that against no-fly zones,
and airports and big cities

00:04:24.720 --> 00:04:26.950
to make sure that we
don't have any issues.

00:04:26.950 --> 00:04:28.010
And, oh.

00:04:28.010 --> 00:04:30.230
It'll pop over Los
Banos and land--

00:04:30.230 --> 00:04:30.815
VIMAL BHALODIA: A
little bit over--

00:04:30.815 --> 00:04:31.400
BOTH: [INAUDIBLE].

00:04:31.400 --> 00:04:31.830
VIMAL BHALODIA:
That's not a bad area.

00:04:31.830 --> 00:04:32.090
Nice.

00:04:32.090 --> 00:04:32.960
HEATHER BRUNDAGE: Sweet.

00:04:32.960 --> 00:04:34.835
So it looks like Saturday's
going to be good.

00:04:40.390 --> 00:04:44.372
We do run extra predictions
right at the time of launch

00:04:44.372 --> 00:04:47.249
since wind predictions are only
so good, and they can change.

00:04:47.249 --> 00:04:49.540
VIMAL BHALODIA: I'm going to
be preparing the payloads,

00:04:49.540 --> 00:04:51.750
putting in the batteries,
turning on the phones,

00:04:51.750 --> 00:04:53.055
just doing a final
check to make sure all

00:04:53.055 --> 00:04:54.040
the software's running.

00:04:54.040 --> 00:04:55.780
It looks like it's working.

00:04:55.780 --> 00:04:58.557
HEATHER BRUNDAGE: We've also
added in an Android camera.

00:04:58.557 --> 00:04:59.390
So it's not a phone.

00:04:59.390 --> 00:05:00.500
It's specifically a camera.

00:05:00.500 --> 00:05:02.291
So it's much better
than the camera in just

00:05:02.291 --> 00:05:03.291
a regular Android phone.

00:05:03.291 --> 00:05:05.416
VIMAL BHALODIA: There are
a lot of different things

00:05:05.416 --> 00:05:07.120
to worry about in
these payloads.

00:05:07.120 --> 00:05:08.930
We have a bunch of
trade offs with respect

00:05:08.930 --> 00:05:12.439
to weight, power
consumption, the electronics

00:05:12.439 --> 00:05:13.480
and their sophistication.

00:05:13.480 --> 00:05:14.860
HEATHER BRUNDAGE:
Are you guys ready?

00:05:14.860 --> 00:05:16.568
VIMAL BHALODIA: At
the day of the launch,

00:05:16.568 --> 00:05:18.280
we have a minimum
of three people.

00:05:18.280 --> 00:05:20.660
We have the helium person,
the balloon person,

00:05:20.660 --> 00:05:22.030
and the lift person.

00:05:22.030 --> 00:05:24.720
And then ideally, we also have
a fourth person with us who's

00:05:24.720 --> 00:05:26.250
reading off the directions.

00:05:26.250 --> 00:05:27.666
FEMALE SPEAKER:
Slide balloon neck

00:05:27.666 --> 00:05:30.210
approximately 3 inches over
the PVC balloon fill nozzle.

00:05:33.700 --> 00:05:36.082
VIMAL BHALODIA: This is
by far the hardest part.

00:05:36.082 --> 00:05:37.310
FEMALE SPEAKER: All
right, helium filled?

00:05:37.310 --> 00:05:37.830
VIMAL BHALODIA: Ready.

00:05:37.830 --> 00:05:38.621
FEMALE SPEAKER: Go.

00:05:53.539 --> 00:05:55.080
VIMAL BHALODIA: Ooh,
this is perfect.

00:05:55.080 --> 00:05:55.375
HEATHER BRUNDAGE: Great.

00:05:55.375 --> 00:05:55.670
FEMALE SPEAKER: Yay.

00:05:55.670 --> 00:05:56.070
VIMAL BHALODIA: All right.

00:05:56.070 --> 00:05:57.790
Then we tie the
payloads to them,

00:05:57.790 --> 00:06:00.120
let them go, cross our fingers.

00:06:00.120 --> 00:06:03.062
ALL: Three, two, one.

00:06:03.062 --> 00:06:04.895
Wooh.

00:06:04.895 --> 00:06:06.436
HEATHER BRUNDAGE:
Go, little balloon.

00:06:06.436 --> 00:06:06.936
Go.

00:06:06.936 --> 00:06:09.330
You can do it.

00:06:09.330 --> 00:06:11.355
Wow, that's really
awesome to see.

00:06:11.355 --> 00:06:11.855
Oh, man.

00:06:11.855 --> 00:06:12.396
Look at that.

00:06:12.396 --> 00:06:14.754
It just "woosh."

00:06:14.754 --> 00:06:15.254
Yes.

00:06:20.480 --> 00:06:23.142
Once the balloon is in the air,
we're actively tracking it.

00:06:23.142 --> 00:06:24.350
We have two devices in there.

00:06:24.350 --> 00:06:26.360
They're both sending
us GPS location.

00:06:26.360 --> 00:06:27.190
So they're close.

00:06:27.190 --> 00:06:28.731
They're a little
off from each other.

00:06:28.731 --> 00:06:30.980
But you can see she's
drifting south east ever so

00:06:30.980 --> 00:06:32.870
slightly, which is
exactly what we expected.

00:06:36.050 --> 00:06:39.430
We do lose contact with the
balloon at about 20,000 feet

00:06:39.430 --> 00:06:41.300
when it leaves cell reception.

00:06:41.300 --> 00:06:43.800
The cell phone is still
getting GPS data up

00:06:43.800 --> 00:06:47.510
to about 60,000 feet when
it then loses GPS data.

00:06:47.510 --> 00:06:49.980
When the balloon
rises, it expands.

00:06:49.980 --> 00:06:52.880
And when it gets high
enough, it bursts.

00:06:52.880 --> 00:06:54.580
And that's when the
parachute deploys

00:06:54.580 --> 00:06:56.810
and it starts to
descend back to earth.

00:06:56.810 --> 00:06:58.740
At this point, it's
falling at about 5 meters

00:06:58.740 --> 00:07:00.380
per second with the parachute.

00:07:00.380 --> 00:07:01.880
And it's spinning around.

00:07:01.880 --> 00:07:05.410
So it takes it a while to get
a cell reception and a GPS lock

00:07:05.410 --> 00:07:07.420
once it gets below there.

00:07:07.420 --> 00:07:10.530
It could land on a
freeway, which we hope not.

00:07:10.530 --> 00:07:13.380
It could land in a farm field,
or it could land in the water.

00:07:13.380 --> 00:07:13.997
We don't know.

00:07:13.997 --> 00:07:16.080
VIMAL BHALODIA: The worst
part possible thing that

00:07:16.080 --> 00:07:18.320
could go wrong is that
the payload actually

00:07:18.320 --> 00:07:21.350
lands on a road or
inside a crowded area.

00:07:21.350 --> 00:07:24.979
And we take a lot of precautions
in choosing both our launch

00:07:24.979 --> 00:07:26.770
site, as well as our
expected landing site,

00:07:26.770 --> 00:07:28.940
to make sure that that's
not going to happen.

00:07:28.940 --> 00:07:30.920
HEATHER BRUNDAGE: We could just
lose the balloon completely,

00:07:30.920 --> 00:07:32.650
have no contact with
it, the batteries

00:07:32.650 --> 00:07:35.870
could die, the phone
could stop working,

00:07:35.870 --> 00:07:38.210
the program could
crash and not reboot.

00:07:38.210 --> 00:07:40.760
And if we don't hear from it,
we're not going to get it back.

00:07:40.760 --> 00:07:42.384
VIMAL BHALODIA: About
half the launches

00:07:42.384 --> 00:07:44.170
that people have done
and blogged about,

00:07:44.170 --> 00:07:47.192
they never saw again.

00:07:47.192 --> 00:07:48.900
HEATHER BRUNDAGE: Hey,
to a great launch.

00:07:48.900 --> 00:07:49.775
MALE SPEAKER: Hooray.

00:07:49.775 --> 00:07:51.029
ALL: Cheers.

00:07:51.029 --> 00:07:52.570
HEATHER BRUNDAGE:
To a full recovery.

00:07:52.570 --> 00:07:54.028
VIMAL BHALODIA: To
a full recovery.

00:07:55.720 --> 00:07:56.500
Oh, wow.

00:07:56.500 --> 00:07:57.940
HEATHER BRUNDAGE: She
went pretty far south.

00:07:57.940 --> 00:07:59.398
VIMAL BHALODIA: So
it's in a field.

00:07:59.398 --> 00:08:00.660
We don't have to worry.

00:08:00.660 --> 00:08:01.460
HEATHER BRUNDAGE:
Right in a farm field.

00:08:01.460 --> 00:08:01.830
VIMAL BHALODIA: Perfect.

00:08:01.830 --> 00:08:03.413
HEATHER BRUNDAGE:
Let's go pick it up.

00:08:06.570 --> 00:08:08.600
This was a perfect day
for Central Valley wind.

00:08:08.600 --> 00:08:11.090
It was exactly as
we usually expected.

00:08:11.090 --> 00:08:15.010
A nice southeast wind.

00:08:15.010 --> 00:08:17.635
VIMAL BHALODIA: So I'm about as
zoomed in as I can possibly be.

00:08:17.635 --> 00:08:19.009
HEATHER BRUNDAGE:
And here, wait.

00:08:19.009 --> 00:08:20.009
Let me show you the map.

00:08:20.009 --> 00:08:22.258
VIMAL BHALODIA: So one of
the great things about using

00:08:22.258 --> 00:08:24.765
an Android phone is actually,
in addition to using GPS,

00:08:24.765 --> 00:08:26.390
we're also using
network triangulation.

00:08:26.390 --> 00:08:29.100
So we have a much more
accurate location spot on it,

00:08:29.100 --> 00:08:30.450
down to a couple of feet.

00:08:30.450 --> 00:08:31.840
HEATHER BRUNDAGE: Just hoping
there aren't, like, snakes.

00:08:31.840 --> 00:08:33.157
VIMAL BHALODIA: Or sprinklers.

00:08:33.157 --> 00:08:34.490
HEATHER BRUNDAGE: Or sprinklers.

00:08:34.490 --> 00:08:38.002
Typically, we can see the
red parachute sticking up.

00:08:38.002 --> 00:08:38.960
This time, we couldn't.

00:08:38.960 --> 00:08:43.010
So we have this big, green
field and no red dot.

00:08:43.010 --> 00:08:45.420
So we had to start
tromping through the field.

00:08:45.420 --> 00:08:48.080
But finally, we got right on
top of it, and there it was.

00:08:48.080 --> 00:08:49.035
Found it!

00:08:49.035 --> 00:08:49.535
ALL: Woo!

00:08:52.445 --> 00:08:53.250
Awesome!

00:08:53.250 --> 00:08:54.750
HEATHER BRUNDAGE:
The Android device

00:08:54.750 --> 00:08:56.333
knew where it was
well enough, and was

00:08:56.333 --> 00:08:58.970
able to communicate its location
to us well enough, that it

00:08:58.970 --> 00:08:59.762
led us right to it.

00:08:59.762 --> 00:09:01.761
It was a homing beacon,
effectively, just purely

00:09:01.761 --> 00:09:02.500
through GPS data.

00:09:02.500 --> 00:09:04.930
And even if all we knew was,
hey, it's in this field,

00:09:04.930 --> 00:09:06.138
it would've taken us forever.

00:09:06.138 --> 00:09:07.999
A combine would have
found it before we did.

00:09:07.999 --> 00:09:10.165
We would have had to fly
over the field to see that.

00:09:14.820 --> 00:09:15.616
Oh wow.

00:09:15.616 --> 00:09:16.392
Oh my goodness.

00:09:16.392 --> 00:09:18.850
VIMAL BHALODIA: Everything is
still pretty safe, and solid,

00:09:18.850 --> 00:09:19.887
and secure.

00:09:19.887 --> 00:09:20.970
HEATHER BRUNDAGE: Oh, man.

00:09:20.970 --> 00:09:22.144
Look at this.

00:09:22.144 --> 00:09:22.810
It pretty much--

00:09:22.810 --> 00:09:24.893
MALE SPEAKER: It tied
itself into a little Pompom.

00:09:24.893 --> 00:09:26.740
HEATHER BRUNDAGE: Wow.

00:09:26.740 --> 00:09:30.100
VIMAL BHALODIA: So here is
our happy, reliable phone.

00:09:30.100 --> 00:09:31.726
It's been ticking along.

00:09:31.726 --> 00:09:32.850
HEATHER BRUNDAGE: Still on?

00:09:32.850 --> 00:09:34.320
VIMAL BHALODIA: It is still on.

00:09:34.320 --> 00:09:35.730
It has a great connection, too.

00:09:35.730 --> 00:09:37.370
HEATHER BRUNDAGE: Awesome.

00:09:37.370 --> 00:09:39.860
VIMAL BHALODIA: Everything
looks to be in tact.

00:09:39.860 --> 00:09:42.572
When we recover the payloads,
we bring computers with us,

00:09:42.572 --> 00:09:44.030
and we like to look
at the picture.

00:09:44.030 --> 00:09:45.470
HEATHER BRUNDAGE: Which
is really satisfying,

00:09:45.470 --> 00:09:47.270
at the end of a long day,
to see these pictures

00:09:47.270 --> 00:09:48.394
that you've just retrieved.

00:09:51.335 --> 00:09:53.460
If other people are interested
in doing ballooning,

00:09:53.460 --> 00:09:56.230
our code is open source
and available online.

00:09:58.429 --> 00:10:00.845
VIMAL BHALODIA: Everyone who
does this has their own site,

00:10:00.845 --> 00:10:02.987
and has their own blog,
and tells their own story

00:10:02.987 --> 00:10:05.570
about their launches, and their
payload, and their experience.

00:10:05.570 --> 00:10:08.700
And we've read a ton of them,
and learned a lot from that.

00:10:08.700 --> 00:10:16.096
And we also want to share our
story at casadeballoon.club

00:10:16.096 --> 00:10:17.970
HEATHER BRUNDAGE: We're
Casa de Balloon Club.

00:10:17.970 --> 00:10:19.928
VIMAL BHALODIA: And this
was Made with android.

00:10:23.160 --> 00:10:24.910
The problem with regular
lithium batteries

00:10:24.910 --> 00:10:27.500
is, when it gets really,
really, cold, they stop working.

00:10:27.500 --> 00:10:31.520
So that's why we had to switch
to lithium primary batteries.

00:10:31.520 --> 00:10:32.395
Take it away from me.

00:10:32.395 --> 00:10:34.785
We're done.

00:10:34.785 --> 00:10:36.660
LAURENCE MORONEY: Well,
that was a fun video.

00:10:36.660 --> 00:10:37.560
And I hope you enjoyed it.

00:10:37.560 --> 00:10:39.090
And I'm sitting here
now with the director

00:10:39.090 --> 00:10:40.350
of the video, Brian Grady.

00:10:40.350 --> 00:10:42.500
So Brian, welcome to
Coffee with a Googler.

00:10:42.500 --> 00:10:43.916
BRIAN GRADY: Thanks
for having me.

00:10:43.916 --> 00:10:45.700
You really loved the show.

00:10:45.700 --> 00:10:46.110
LAURENCE MORONEY: Thank you.

00:10:46.110 --> 00:10:46.610
Thank you.

00:10:46.610 --> 00:10:48.500
So for those of you
guys who are watching,

00:10:48.500 --> 00:10:51.460
Brian and I came up with the
concept of Coffee with a Google

00:10:51.460 --> 00:10:52.170
together.

00:10:52.170 --> 00:10:54.390
He's actually the
brains behind the show.

00:10:54.390 --> 00:10:57.697
He's also the beauty
behind the show, as well.

00:10:57.697 --> 00:10:59.030
BRIAN GRADY: Thank you, so much.

00:10:59.030 --> 00:11:01.205
I never thought I'd actually
be the Googler that you

00:11:01.205 --> 00:11:02.190
were having coffee with.

00:11:02.190 --> 00:11:03.230
So this a nice of
change of pace.

00:11:03.230 --> 00:11:05.146
LAURENCE MORONEY: It's
my privilege, actually.

00:11:05.146 --> 00:11:06.890
So tell us about the
Made With Android.

00:11:06.890 --> 00:11:08.965
That looked like a
whole ball of fun.

00:11:08.965 --> 00:11:11.340
BRIAN GRADY: Man, we're so
excited about this new series.

00:11:11.340 --> 00:11:12.320
It's a web series.

00:11:12.320 --> 00:11:15.990
It's a documentary style, as
anybody who saw it could see.

00:11:15.990 --> 00:11:18.270
And the reason we're
excited about it

00:11:18.270 --> 00:11:20.775
is because we do
Coffee with a Googler,

00:11:20.775 --> 00:11:23.130
it's always talking with
Googlers about Google stuff.

00:11:23.130 --> 00:11:25.560
And you know, we
don't try to be pushy,

00:11:25.560 --> 00:11:29.382
but we want to expose and make
things easier for people to do.

00:11:29.382 --> 00:11:30.340
LAURENCE MORONEY: Sure.

00:11:30.340 --> 00:11:32.923
BRIAN GRADY: Made With Android
is about finding people outside

00:11:32.923 --> 00:11:35.300
of Google, doing things
that nobody expected

00:11:35.300 --> 00:11:37.054
them to do with a phone.

00:11:37.054 --> 00:11:38.970
So we found out that
there's a lot of people--

00:11:38.970 --> 00:11:40.219
there's a community out there.

00:11:40.219 --> 00:11:42.890
People that, because of the
extensibility of the Android

00:11:42.890 --> 00:11:46.054
operating system, are able to
make incredible applications

00:11:46.054 --> 00:11:47.220
that do crazy things, like--

00:11:47.220 --> 00:11:48.940
LAURENCE MORONEY: Like
flying a weather balloon.

00:11:48.940 --> 00:11:49.970
BRIAN GRADY: Flying
a weather balloon,

00:11:49.970 --> 00:11:51.840
or opening your
apartment door when

00:11:51.840 --> 00:11:54.864
you're at the top of
the stairs and your bags

00:11:54.864 --> 00:11:55.780
are full of groceries.

00:11:55.780 --> 00:11:56.910
I don't know how you do that.

00:11:56.910 --> 00:11:58.340
Your hands are full
of-- but anyway.

00:11:58.340 --> 00:11:59.220
There's things like that.

00:11:59.220 --> 00:12:00.140
LAURENCE MORONEY: The
things that people

00:12:00.140 --> 00:12:01.700
will think of that we
cant think of, right?

00:12:01.700 --> 00:12:03.470
BRIAN GRADY: So we're looking
for stories like that.

00:12:03.470 --> 00:12:04.640
We've got a couple lined up.

00:12:04.640 --> 00:12:07.217
This is the first full
piece that we've completed.

00:12:07.217 --> 00:12:08.550
And we're looking for new ideas.

00:12:08.550 --> 00:12:11.570
So if somebody's got any ideas,
if they know of fantastic

00:12:11.570 --> 00:12:13.390
things that are
made with Android,

00:12:13.390 --> 00:12:17.040
we'd like to hear about them in
our G+ comments on the YouTube

00:12:17.040 --> 00:12:18.104
channel.

00:12:18.104 --> 00:12:19.520
Speaking of the
channel, we should

00:12:19.520 --> 00:12:21.186
talk about the Google
Developers YouTube

00:12:21.186 --> 00:12:25.539
channel, which is where the
bulk of my teams work ends up.

00:12:25.539 --> 00:12:27.080
LAURENCE MORONEY:
What's the criteria

00:12:27.080 --> 00:12:29.792
that you're looking for
somebody to pitch something

00:12:29.792 --> 00:12:30.500
for these videos?

00:12:30.500 --> 00:12:31.333
BRIAN GRADY: Thanks.

00:12:31.333 --> 00:12:33.020
For Made With
Android, we're looking

00:12:33.020 --> 00:12:36.389
for non-Google employees.

00:12:36.389 --> 00:12:37.680
LAURENCE MORONEY: Rules me out.

00:12:37.680 --> 00:12:38.388
BRIAN GRADY: Yes.

00:12:38.388 --> 00:12:40.060
We want non-commercial
applications

00:12:40.060 --> 00:12:43.300
that are about fun, or
hobby lifestyle kind

00:12:43.300 --> 00:12:45.850
of stuff, new connecting
new things that people

00:12:45.850 --> 00:12:46.890
hadn't connected.

00:12:46.890 --> 00:12:49.460
We want it to be an
open source project.

00:12:49.460 --> 00:12:53.890
And we want to be able to,
not only entertain people

00:12:53.890 --> 00:12:55.400
and inspire people
with the video,

00:12:55.400 --> 00:12:59.129
but also provide them with
the code, the applications,

00:12:59.129 --> 00:13:01.420
and maybe they'll go out and
do something else with it.

00:13:01.420 --> 00:13:02.390
LAURENCE MORONEY: So
somebody can pick this

00:13:02.390 --> 00:13:03.681
and run with it for themselves.

00:13:03.681 --> 00:13:05.455
Like I could actually
go and get a weather

00:13:05.455 --> 00:13:07.830
balloon myself, now, and start
doing what these folks do.

00:13:07.830 --> 00:13:11.640
BRIAN GRADY: You go
to casadeballoon.club,

00:13:11.640 --> 00:13:13.420
which is this group's website.

00:13:13.420 --> 00:13:15.339
LAURENCE MORONEY:
I love the .club.

00:13:15.339 --> 00:13:16.880
BRIAN GRADY: I like
the casadeballon.

00:13:16.880 --> 00:13:19.970
But anyway, they have a
whole thing set up there.

00:13:19.970 --> 00:13:20.890
You can go there.

00:13:20.890 --> 00:13:22.040
You can download their app.

00:13:22.040 --> 00:13:24.230
You can see where they've flown.

00:13:24.230 --> 00:13:26.180
They have flight logs.

00:13:26.180 --> 00:13:27.180
It's really interesting.

00:13:27.180 --> 00:13:31.050
It's like sending up,
really, your own space,

00:13:31.050 --> 00:13:32.650
exploratory project.

00:13:32.650 --> 00:13:34.320
You get these
beautiful photographs

00:13:34.320 --> 00:13:37.014
of the earth, which are
in the video, as well.

00:13:37.014 --> 00:13:39.430
LAURENCE MORONEY: I always
wanted to do the slice of pizza

00:13:39.430 --> 00:13:42.290
in space kind of pictures.

00:13:42.290 --> 00:13:46.910
In this case, we'll do a Coffee
With a Googler mug in space.

00:13:46.910 --> 00:13:49.190
I guess, the more exotic
the locale, the better?

00:13:49.190 --> 00:13:50.190
BRIAN GRADY: Absolutely.

00:13:50.190 --> 00:13:53.040
We're looking for things
to produce-- right now,

00:13:53.040 --> 00:13:56.220
I'm looking for things
in the Mediterranean.

00:13:56.220 --> 00:13:58.505
LAURENCE MORONEY: I'm
more a Tahiti guy myself.

00:13:58.505 --> 00:13:59.880
BRIAN GRADY: Well,
I hear they're

00:13:59.880 --> 00:14:02.690
doing interesting things
with Maps down in Tahiti.

00:14:02.690 --> 00:14:03.370
LAURENCE MORONEY:
Got to get on that.

00:14:03.370 --> 00:14:03.990
BRIAN GRADY: Yeah.

00:14:03.990 --> 00:14:05.560
I think we ought
to get down there.

00:14:05.560 --> 00:14:06.280
LAURENCE MORONEY:
This show is going

00:14:06.280 --> 00:14:08.310
to go on the YouTube
Developers channell, right?

00:14:08.310 --> 00:14:10.530
There's lots of great types
of shows on that channel.

00:14:10.530 --> 00:14:11.780
Could you tell us about them?

00:14:11.780 --> 00:14:14.460
BRIAN GRADY: So we have a team
of multiple producers, at least

00:14:14.460 --> 00:14:17.200
four full time producers.

00:14:17.200 --> 00:14:19.450
It's really like a television
production company.

00:14:19.450 --> 00:14:22.960
And we're putting out, I'd
say, three, four, maybe five

00:14:22.960 --> 00:14:24.500
different kinds of content.

00:14:24.500 --> 00:14:28.710
We've got very specific task
oriented, instructional sort

00:14:28.710 --> 00:14:30.930
of work, where you
learn to implement

00:14:30.930 --> 00:14:33.280
an API in your application.

00:14:33.280 --> 00:14:35.850
We've got this more
inspirational stuff

00:14:35.850 --> 00:14:37.700
where you see what
people have done,

00:14:37.700 --> 00:14:40.960
and we don't really dive
into how did they do that,

00:14:40.960 --> 00:14:45.060
but there's always a link
to how they did that.

00:14:45.060 --> 00:14:48.915
And then, we have a
great LazyWeb shows

00:14:48.915 --> 00:14:51.612
for developers who
don't have the time

00:14:51.612 --> 00:14:53.320
to sift through
everything that comes out

00:14:53.320 --> 00:14:54.827
on the web every week.

00:14:54.827 --> 00:14:55.910
We have a rundown of that.

00:14:55.910 --> 00:14:59.602
We're going to be doing a
weekly Android round up.

00:14:59.602 --> 00:15:01.060
In the next couple
of months, we're

00:15:01.060 --> 00:15:02.970
going to start that-- probably
in the next couple of weeks,

00:15:02.970 --> 00:15:03.584
I should say.

00:15:03.584 --> 00:15:06.000
LAURENCE MORONEY: I'm personally
a big fan of the DevBytes

00:15:06.000 --> 00:15:09.700
because, as a developer, there's
so much new information coming

00:15:09.700 --> 00:15:12.160
thick and fast every day.

00:15:12.160 --> 00:15:13.630
The nice thing
about a DevByte is

00:15:13.630 --> 00:15:16.630
I can sit down for three or
four minutes, watch the DevByte,

00:15:16.630 --> 00:15:20.110
and then learn if I really care
about that technology or not,

00:15:20.110 --> 00:15:23.260
instead of investing a few
hours dissecting a sample

00:15:23.260 --> 00:15:25.109
or reading through
documentation.

00:15:25.109 --> 00:15:26.650
I watch the DevByte
for three minutes

00:15:26.650 --> 00:15:28.640
and I go, yes, I care
about this or, no,

00:15:28.640 --> 00:15:29.860
I don't care about this.

00:15:29.860 --> 00:15:30.980
It's a great time saver.

00:15:30.980 --> 00:15:31.490
BRIAN GRADY: And
that's that the format

00:15:31.490 --> 00:15:33.920
that we try to set them up,
that you know in the first 20

00:15:33.920 --> 00:15:36.220
seconds whether
this applies to you.

00:15:36.220 --> 00:15:39.806
We'll suggest other videos as
YouTube does of similar things

00:15:39.806 --> 00:15:42.430
so you don't have to sit through
that one if you don't want to.

00:15:42.430 --> 00:15:43.705
But if it's something
that you're looking for.

00:15:43.705 --> 00:15:44.830
it's very powerful.

00:15:44.830 --> 00:15:48.160
And we're also trying to
make those more entertaining.

00:15:48.160 --> 00:15:51.000
We're adding little
intros and outros.

00:15:51.000 --> 00:15:54.450
Famous ones are for
Google Play Services

00:15:54.450 --> 00:15:56.290
that your partner Magnus is in.

00:15:56.290 --> 00:15:57.810
[INTERPOSING VOICES]

00:15:57.810 --> 00:16:00.020
BRIAN GRADY: So go look
those up on the channel.

00:16:00.020 --> 00:16:01.450
Subscribe to the
channel, please.

00:16:01.450 --> 00:16:02.140
You must subscribe.

00:16:02.140 --> 00:16:03.240
LAURENCE MORONEY: Subscribe
to the channel, right now.

00:16:03.240 --> 00:16:05.562
It's definitely going
to be worth your click.

00:16:05.562 --> 00:16:08.020
My favorite [INAUDIBLE] ones
is like when my head comes out

00:16:08.020 --> 00:16:09.480
of the coffee cup
and looks around,

00:16:09.480 --> 00:16:10.980
and I look really creepy.

00:16:10.980 --> 00:16:12.014
You did that?

00:16:12.014 --> 00:16:13.180
BRIAN GRADY: I didn't do it.

00:16:13.180 --> 00:16:16.807
It was-- maybe, you'll
come out of this?

00:16:16.807 --> 00:16:17.640
[INTERPOSING VOICES]

00:16:17.640 --> 00:16:19.348
BRIAN GRADY: Watch
Coffee with a Googler.

00:16:19.348 --> 00:16:21.230
You'll see people popping
out of coffee cups.

00:16:21.230 --> 00:16:22.772
They'll eat when
you least expect it.

00:16:22.772 --> 00:16:25.105
LAURENCE MORONEY: And now,
in addition to all the stuff,

00:16:25.105 --> 00:16:27.054
we also have these
Udacity courses, right?

00:16:27.054 --> 00:16:27.970
BRIAN GRADY: Oh, yeah.

00:16:27.970 --> 00:16:30.650
Udacity is this
great partnership

00:16:30.650 --> 00:16:33.089
that's been brewing.

00:16:33.089 --> 00:16:34.630
It's really been
working really well.

00:16:34.630 --> 00:16:39.012
And we just sort of started
stepping that up a bit.

00:16:39.012 --> 00:16:40.470
I think you might
actually-- you're

00:16:40.470 --> 00:16:42.290
asking me questions-- you
might know a little bit more

00:16:42.290 --> 00:16:43.080
about that program than I do.

00:16:43.080 --> 00:16:44.335
LAURENCE MORONEY: I know
a little bit about that.

00:16:44.335 --> 00:16:45.530
BRIAN GRADY: So Lawrence has--

00:16:45.530 --> 00:16:47.446
LAURENCE MORONEY: I was
teeing it up for them.

00:16:47.446 --> 00:16:50.640
BRIAN GRADY: Laurence has been
making a wonderful contribution

00:16:50.640 --> 00:16:52.760
to the Udacity courses.

00:16:52.760 --> 00:16:55.600
LAURENCE MORONEY: We have a
course on Google Play Services

00:16:55.600 --> 00:16:57.454
that's launching imminently.

00:16:57.454 --> 00:16:59.370
And so in that one, we're
going to be covering

00:16:59.370 --> 00:17:01.328
some of the great
technologies that we actually

00:17:01.328 --> 00:17:05.430
saw on the keynote, somethings
such as maps, and location,

00:17:05.430 --> 00:17:07.697
and ads, said Analytics.

00:17:07.697 --> 00:17:09.280
There's so many that
we're putting in,

00:17:09.280 --> 00:17:10.890
I can't remember them all.

00:17:10.890 --> 00:17:13.700
But one of the nice things
about how these Udacity courses

00:17:13.700 --> 00:17:15.740
work is that, if you're
not familiar with them

00:17:15.740 --> 00:17:18.109
is that, a lot of the
times, video instruction

00:17:18.109 --> 00:17:19.500
tends to be a talking head.

00:17:19.500 --> 00:17:22.524
And it's a person presenting,
and then pointing at some code,

00:17:22.524 --> 00:17:24.690
and then asking you to
download something, and maybe

00:17:24.690 --> 00:17:25.810
read a document.

00:17:25.810 --> 00:17:27.930
And then it's just them
continually talking.

00:17:27.930 --> 00:17:29.030
It's very one way.

00:17:29.030 --> 00:17:30.780
But the way these
courses have been set up

00:17:30.780 --> 00:17:32.800
is that they're much
more interactive.

00:17:32.800 --> 00:17:34.970
And obviously, you can't
interact with an instructor

00:17:34.970 --> 00:17:36.780
because they're on
the computer screen.

00:17:36.780 --> 00:17:39.260
But it's lots of short segments.

00:17:39.260 --> 00:17:41.972
And then those segments usually
end with a quiz or a challenge.

00:17:41.972 --> 00:17:44.430
BRIAN GRADY: And don't you do
occasional live streams where

00:17:44.430 --> 00:17:46.294
you'll have the
experts available?

00:17:46.294 --> 00:17:47.210
LAURENCE MORONEY: Yes.

00:17:47.210 --> 00:17:48.110
BRIAN GRADY: So
there is a little.

00:17:48.110 --> 00:17:49.480
LAURENCE MORONEY: So there
is that level of interaction.

00:17:49.480 --> 00:17:51.313
If you're doing the
nanodegree, for example,

00:17:51.313 --> 00:17:52.860
you can interact
with instructors.

00:17:52.860 --> 00:17:55.894
And there's also these Code
Jams that they do where

00:17:55.894 --> 00:17:57.060
lots of people get together.

00:17:57.060 --> 00:17:58.768
I was actually in
Dublin a few months ago

00:17:58.768 --> 00:18:00.860
for the launch of one of
the study groups there,

00:18:00.860 --> 00:18:03.660
one of the Code Jams around the
Android Fundamentals Udacity

00:18:03.660 --> 00:18:04.160
course.

00:18:04.160 --> 00:18:05.400
And it was really
cool because that's

00:18:05.400 --> 00:18:06.816
when you get a
bunch of developers

00:18:06.816 --> 00:18:09.010
together to start working
through all the problems

00:18:09.010 --> 00:18:11.060
together because these
courses aren't just

00:18:11.060 --> 00:18:13.930
handing you the information
and expecting you to know it.

00:18:13.930 --> 00:18:16.347
They're actually challenging
you to do stuff step by step.

00:18:16.347 --> 00:18:18.388
BRIAN GRADY: And when a
bunch of people like that

00:18:18.388 --> 00:18:20.650
get together in a room, I
mean just as a filmmaker,

00:18:20.650 --> 00:18:23.450
to film that and capture some
of what's happening is amazing.

00:18:23.450 --> 00:18:25.120
So I want to do more of that.

00:18:25.120 --> 00:18:28.000
But you mentioned the
nanodegree program with Udacity.

00:18:28.000 --> 00:18:28.540
Wow.

00:18:28.540 --> 00:18:31.710
What an opportunity for
people that aren't necessarily

00:18:31.710 --> 00:18:35.700
coders to learn how to code in
Android, make an application,

00:18:35.700 --> 00:18:37.345
and it's all available online.

00:18:37.345 --> 00:18:38.570
LAURENCE MORONEY: It's
all available online.

00:18:38.570 --> 00:18:40.028
And you end up with
a certification

00:18:40.028 --> 00:18:42.209
that you can use on your resume.

00:18:42.209 --> 00:18:44.250
BRIAN GRADY: This is
getting you a job, actually.

00:18:44.250 --> 00:18:47.220
You can actually get the
nanodegree, and get a job.

00:18:47.220 --> 00:18:51.080
But we have also made some
interstitial programming

00:18:51.080 --> 00:18:52.435
to show for Udacity.

00:18:52.435 --> 00:18:53.810
This might be a
surprise for you,

00:18:53.810 --> 00:18:57.100
but I believe my friend in
the control room has a video,

00:18:57.100 --> 00:18:58.689
it's the Udacity nanodegree--

00:18:58.689 --> 00:18:59.980
LAURENCE MORONEY: Let's run it.

00:18:59.980 --> 00:19:01.160
BRIAN GRADY: --trailer.

00:19:01.160 --> 00:19:01.700
Shall we?

00:19:01.700 --> 00:19:03.130
LAURENCE MORONEY:
Should we run it now?

00:19:03.130 --> 00:19:03.838
BRIAN GRADY: Yes.

00:19:03.838 --> 00:19:05.480
LAURENCE MORONEY:
Sounds good to me.

00:19:05.480 --> 00:19:06.896
KATHERINE KUAN:
The reason why I'm

00:19:06.896 --> 00:19:08.960
an Android developer is
because of the platform's

00:19:08.960 --> 00:19:09.990
massive reach.

00:19:09.990 --> 00:19:13.290
Building for Android means that
you can build something here

00:19:13.290 --> 00:19:16.380
and it will reach people all
the way across the world.

00:19:16.380 --> 00:19:18.650
In fact, the next billion
people coming online

00:19:18.650 --> 00:19:21.350
will interact with the internet
for the very first time using

00:19:21.350 --> 00:19:22.680
only a mobile device.

00:19:22.680 --> 00:19:25.207
There's so many people who
are consumers of technology,

00:19:25.207 --> 00:19:26.790
but I think it's so
much more powerful

00:19:26.790 --> 00:19:28.980
to be a creator of technology.

00:19:28.980 --> 00:19:32.120
Everyone has unique
experiences and strengths,

00:19:32.120 --> 00:19:34.360
and they can draw
on that and use

00:19:34.360 --> 00:19:36.720
that to identify problems
in their community,

00:19:36.720 --> 00:19:39.230
and then, use technology
to solve that.

00:19:39.230 --> 00:19:41.420
I really feel like
there's a big opportunity

00:19:41.420 --> 00:19:43.250
to show people that
they can create

00:19:43.250 --> 00:19:44.530
something really amazing.

00:19:44.530 --> 00:19:48.260
You can imagine something
that you think should exist.

00:19:48.260 --> 00:19:50.740
And you can actually
go and build it.

00:19:50.740 --> 00:19:53.392
I can't think of anything
more powerful than that.

00:19:53.392 --> 00:19:55.350
You can start your journey
to become an Android

00:19:55.350 --> 00:19:59.080
developer, today, with Udacity
and Google's nanodegree.
