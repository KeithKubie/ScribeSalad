While you may think it is an error at first,

00:00:02.410 --> 00:00:05.700
the most likely explanation is that you have an identical

00:00:05.700 --> 00:00:09.470
twin. As you recall from lesson nine, identical because they

00:00:09.470 --> 00:00:12.640
used to be the same individual cell, or group of

00:00:12.640 --> 00:00:15.690
cells that split during early development. So they share the

00:00:15.690 --> 00:00:19.590
exact same genome. A fraternal twin is like a full

00:00:19.590 --> 00:00:23.120
sibling, so you'd be 50% similar. And to only have

00:00:23.120 --> 00:00:25.400
a mother, means that you must have been a virgin

00:00:25.400 --> 00:00:27.870
birth, which isn't really known to happen in mammals.
