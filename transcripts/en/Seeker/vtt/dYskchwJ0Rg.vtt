00:00:00.120 --> 00:00:02.840
Every time I babysit I wonder what the baby
is thinking.

00:00:02.840 --> 00:00:04.740
And when it cries, I’m like what what small
human?

00:00:04.740 --> 00:00:06.919
What are you trying to tell me?

00:00:06.919 --> 00:00:08.060
The meaning of life?

00:00:08.060 --> 00:00:11.839
And stop calling me peasant.

00:00:11.839 --> 00:00:16.070
Hey guys Julia here for DNews

00:00:16.070 --> 00:00:17.070
Babies.

00:00:17.070 --> 00:00:18.070
Man, babies.

00:00:18.070 --> 00:00:19.070
Cute.

00:00:19.070 --> 00:00:20.070
Cooing.

00:00:20.070 --> 00:00:21.070
Pooping little humans.

00:00:21.070 --> 00:00:22.970
While adorable, they aren’t the smartest
in the bunch.

00:00:22.970 --> 00:00:26.160
I mean, I hide behind my hands and they think
I’m gone forever.

00:00:26.160 --> 00:00:27.490
And peek a boo!

00:00:27.490 --> 00:00:29.820
My face just pops out of nowhere.

00:00:29.820 --> 00:00:33.210
But lately researchers are finding out babies
are smarter than we think.

00:00:33.210 --> 00:00:37.969
A recent study published in the journal Developmental
Science found that babies can reason logically,

00:00:37.969 --> 00:00:39.899
even before the age of one.

00:00:39.899 --> 00:00:44.480
Which apparently researchers thought people
couldn’t do until the age of 5 or 6.

00:00:44.480 --> 00:00:46.089
How did researchers figure this out you ask?

00:00:46.089 --> 00:00:49.339
Well it’s not like they could just give
babies a logic problem to solve.

00:00:49.339 --> 00:00:51.420
Instead they had them watch puppets.

00:00:51.420 --> 00:00:55.140
In this study the puppets acted out a little
scene of social hierarchy.

00:00:55.140 --> 00:00:59.270
Basically puppet one is more dominant than
puppet two, then in another scene puppet two

00:00:59.270 --> 00:01:01.570
is more dominant that puppet 3.

00:01:01.570 --> 00:01:03.390
So who would be more dominant?

00:01:03.390 --> 00:01:04.860
Puppet one or puppet three?

00:01:04.860 --> 00:01:09.460
If you said puppet 1, congratulations! you’re
just as smart as a ten month old baby.

00:01:09.460 --> 00:01:13.540
You can understand transitive inference, which
is a type of deductive reasoning which allows

00:01:13.540 --> 00:01:18.250
someone to make inferences about things that
weren’t explicitly compared before.

00:01:18.250 --> 00:01:22.320
Basically the researchers could tell what
a baby understood based on how long they stared

00:01:22.320 --> 00:01:23.360
at the puppet show.

00:01:23.360 --> 00:01:27.980
If the show went against the transitive inference
and puppet 3 was more dominant, then the babies

00:01:27.980 --> 00:01:30.100
were confused and stared longer.

00:01:30.100 --> 00:01:34.290
That’s based on earlier research that shows
that when something is unfamiliar or unexpected,

00:01:34.290 --> 00:01:36.230
babies will look at it longer.

00:01:36.230 --> 00:01:39.050
And it seems it’s not the only thing young
infants can grasp.

00:01:39.050 --> 00:01:43.370
Knowledge of social situations seems to get
wired in pretty early on in brain development.

00:01:43.370 --> 00:01:47.500
In a study published in the Journal of Experimental
Psychology: General researchers found that

00:01:47.500 --> 00:01:51.570
infants as young as 9 months could understand
that people were likely to be friends based

00:01:51.570 --> 00:01:56.020
on their shared interests; for example, if
they have the same reactions to food.

00:01:56.020 --> 00:01:59.240
In this study researchers show babies videos
where people ate food.

00:01:59.240 --> 00:02:03.030
They either really liked it or made a "hmph"
kind of gesture about it.

00:02:03.030 --> 00:02:06.890
The babies expected those who liked the same
food to be friends and were confused when

00:02:06.890 --> 00:02:08.060
they weren’t.

00:02:08.060 --> 00:02:11.739
The researchers take this to mean that babies
are very aware of what’s going on around

00:02:11.739 --> 00:02:14.430
them and keep track of people’s interactions.

00:02:14.430 --> 00:02:18.709
Babies even have a kind of theory of mind
around 18 months according to a study published

00:02:18.709 --> 00:02:20.319
in Developmental Psychology.

00:02:20.319 --> 00:02:23.849
Which researchers thought kids couldn’t
do until age 8 or so.

00:02:23.849 --> 00:02:26.959
Theory of Mind is trying to imagine what’s
going on in someone else’s head.

00:02:26.959 --> 00:02:30.099
That someone else may want things different
from what you want.

00:02:30.099 --> 00:02:33.209
In one clever experiment a researcher gave
babies two bowls.

00:02:33.209 --> 00:02:36.659
One filled with broccoli and the other with
tasty crackers.

00:02:36.659 --> 00:02:38.200
The babies prefered the crackers.

00:02:38.200 --> 00:02:42.519
Then the researcher would eat from one of
the bowls and either make a happy or disgusted

00:02:42.519 --> 00:02:43.519
reaction.

00:02:43.519 --> 00:02:47.799
They gave the bowls back to the baby and asked
“can I have some”, if the researcher acted

00:02:47.799 --> 00:02:52.660
happy about the broccoli, the baby gave them
broccoli, even though that’s not what the

00:02:52.660 --> 00:02:53.800
babies prefered.

00:02:53.800 --> 00:02:57.689
This showed that these young children could
understand someone else’s desires and use

00:02:57.689 --> 00:03:00.139
that information in how they responded to
them.

00:03:00.139 --> 00:03:02.769
Heck even adults struggle with this sometimes.

00:03:02.769 --> 00:03:07.110
So babies are capable of logical reasoning
and empathy, something researchers thought

00:03:07.110 --> 00:03:08.579
wasn’t possible.

00:03:08.579 --> 00:03:13.109
So one of the lead researchers of the broccoli-goldfish
study Dr. Alison Gopnick believes adults could

00:03:13.109 --> 00:03:14.810
learn a thing or two from babies.

00:03:14.810 --> 00:03:18.329
You know how I said babies stare at things
that are new or confusing?

00:03:18.329 --> 00:03:22.910
Well babies are really good at paying attention
to lots of new and novel things, they just

00:03:22.910 --> 00:03:24.000
kind of soak in everything.

00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:27.719
While as we grow up we learn to focus on just
one thing.

00:03:27.719 --> 00:03:30.370
And sometimes that can blind us to other possibilities.

00:03:30.370 --> 00:03:34.459
She said in an op-ed in the Wall Street Journal
that “Babies, on the other hand, seem to

00:03:34.459 --> 00:03:37.090
have a positive hunger for the unexpected.”

00:03:37.090 --> 00:03:39.579
And that means they’re like little ideal
scientists.

00:03:39.579 --> 00:03:42.169
Yeah now I’m kind of terrified to baby sit
again.

00:03:42.169 --> 00:03:45.629
I might not be so terrified of babies if I
knew exactly what I was getting into.

00:03:45.629 --> 00:03:49.620
I mean what if you could control every detail
about your baby will turn out?

00:03:49.620 --> 00:03:50.889
Sounds like science fiction?

00:03:50.889 --> 00:03:54.439
Well designer babies might not be too far
off.

00:03:54.439 --> 00:03:58.890

and i debate the pros and cons of designing

00:03:58.890 --> 00:04:20.530
your baby.
