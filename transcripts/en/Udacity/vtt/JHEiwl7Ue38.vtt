Another study Bandura did focused on reinforcing the observed behavior. Bandura

00:00:05.210 --> 00:00:10.570
put children in to four groups. Group one saw a video with no models. Group two

00:00:10.570 --> 00:00:16.102
saw two adult males interacting in a nonaggressive way. Group three and group

00:00:16.102 --> 00:00:21.390
four saw two adult males playing with one of the males being aggressive.

00:00:21.390 --> 00:00:26.451
However in group three, the aggressive one was punished. And in group four, the

00:00:26.451 --> 00:00:30.996
aggressive one was rewarded. The first two groups are what we would consider

00:00:30.996 --> 00:00:35.550
the control groups. In group three and group four were the experimental groups.

00:00:35.550 --> 00:00:38.618
The results show that the kids in the two experimental groups were more

00:00:38.618 --> 00:00:43.550
aggressive than the kids in the control groups. However, the kids who saw the

00:00:43.550 --> 00:00:49.090
adult being rewarded were even more aggressive than anyone else. This proves

00:00:49.090 --> 00:00:53.055
that we not only learn from other people's behavior, we also take into account

00:00:53.055 --> 00:00:58.450
the consequences of other people's behavior. And those consequences would be

00:00:58.450 --> 00:01:00.749
either punishment or the reward.
