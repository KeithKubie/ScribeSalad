00:00:00.200 --> 00:00:03.590
So this morning I'm talking to
Sally Okun who's the Vice President

00:00:03.590 --> 00:00:08.210
of Advocacy, Policy, and Public Safety
at Patients Like Me here in Cambridge.

00:00:08.210 --> 00:00:11.260
Sally, thank you so much for
taking the time to be with us today.

00:00:11.260 --> 00:00:12.390
&gt;&gt; Thank you for having me Mark.

00:00:12.390 --> 00:00:14.350
I really appreciate
the chance to talk to you.

00:00:14.350 --> 00:00:15.770
&gt;&gt; So we've talked before,

00:00:15.770 --> 00:00:20.200
and I'm always fascinated by the story
of how Patients Like Me came to be.

00:00:20.200 --> 00:00:21.710
So, would you tell us that story?

00:00:21.710 --> 00:00:23.800
&gt;&gt; Sure, absolutely.

00:00:23.800 --> 00:00:26.703
You know, it's not uncommon at all for
a one patient or

00:00:26.703 --> 00:00:30.000
a one family story to actually
be a driver behind innovation.

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:32.900
Whether it's in healthcare or
some other experience.

00:00:32.900 --> 00:00:35.450
And for our company,
it was very much that.

00:00:35.450 --> 00:00:39.669
So, Stephen Haywood, who was 29 at
the time he was diagnosed with ALS,

00:00:39.669 --> 00:00:42.129
had two brothers, Jamie and Ben Haywood.

00:00:42.129 --> 00:00:43.621
And a good friend Jeff Cole,

00:00:43.621 --> 00:00:47.102
who at the time of Steven's diagnosis
decided to dive in deeply and

00:00:47.102 --> 00:00:50.850
figure out how they might help to
stall the progression of his disease.

00:00:50.850 --> 00:00:54.320
Or, in fact, try to cure his disease.

00:00:54.320 --> 00:00:56.684
All of them coming out of MIT,
engineer-minded and

00:00:56.684 --> 00:00:57.919
solution oriented, and so

00:00:57.919 --> 00:01:01.990
they really wanted to find some ways of
being able to help Stephen through this.

00:01:01.990 --> 00:01:03.940
What they found was rather frustrating.

00:01:03.940 --> 00:01:07.140
A lot of the research wasn't
available for them to be able get at.

00:01:07.140 --> 00:01:10.250
Some of the information that they
were receiving was conflicting.

00:01:10.250 --> 00:01:13.530
And they ultimately decided that much
of what they were actually learning was

00:01:13.530 --> 00:01:16.880
from other patients and families who
were dealing with the same issues.

00:01:16.880 --> 00:01:20.040
And decided that they really needed to
find a way of being able to bring those

00:01:20.040 --> 00:01:23.400
patients and families together to better
learn and connect with each other.

00:01:23.400 --> 00:01:27.860
And ultimately find ways of being able
to monitor track their own experiences.

00:01:27.860 --> 00:01:31.150
Bringing that together, you start to
learn about the collective experience

00:01:31.150 --> 00:01:33.180
and the collective
wisdom of everyone else.

00:01:33.180 --> 00:01:36.090
So Patients Like Me was actually
born out of that kind of model.

00:01:36.090 --> 00:01:39.160
Bringing people together, helping them
find different ways of being able

00:01:39.160 --> 00:01:43.670
to problem solve in their own times of
living with illness, but also finding

00:01:43.670 --> 00:01:47.360
ways of being able to connect to the
opportunities to contribute to research.

00:01:47.360 --> 00:01:49.272
And that was a big
component of what we do.

00:01:49.272 --> 00:01:54.660
&gt;&gt; Well, there's a wonderful story about
the ALS community on patients like me,

00:01:54.660 --> 00:01:59.890
contributing to research around
a report out of Italy I think it was,

00:01:59.890 --> 00:02:02.670
that maybe lithium would
benefit these patients.

00:02:02.670 --> 00:02:03.650
Can you tell us about that?

00:02:03.650 --> 00:02:04.270
&gt;&gt; Sure.

00:02:04.270 --> 00:02:05.200
You're exactly right.

00:02:05.200 --> 00:02:09.220
It was a small Italian study that
was done and it indicated, or

00:02:09.220 --> 00:02:12.940
it claimed actually that the use of
lithium carbonate was actually slowing

00:02:12.940 --> 00:02:16.500
the progression of ALS in
a small subset of patients.

00:02:16.500 --> 00:02:21.230
What our patients on the site, who
are already part of a community that was

00:02:21.230 --> 00:02:24.770
tracking and monitoring their condition,
many of them went to their doctors and

00:02:24.770 --> 00:02:25.550
said I want to try Lithium.

00:02:25.550 --> 00:02:27.950
And in this particular population,

00:02:27.950 --> 00:02:31.190
the doctors will oftentimes try to work
with their patients to try to determine

00:02:31.190 --> 00:02:33.700
an appropriate use for
an off label indication.

00:02:33.700 --> 00:02:36.030
So in this case many of
the patients started using Lithium.

00:02:36.030 --> 00:02:39.150
In fact,
we had about 348 patients on the site,

00:02:39.150 --> 00:02:43.130
who were actively taking Lithium
under their clinician's review and

00:02:43.130 --> 00:02:45.610
starting to track their
experience with that.

00:02:45.610 --> 00:02:50.000
And they came to us, very activated,
to say can you help us start to gather

00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:53.240
the data in such a way that we can
actually start to determine whether or

00:02:53.240 --> 00:02:56.140
not this claim from this
study is right or wrong.

00:02:56.140 --> 00:02:58.810
What we learned in a very short
period of time, quite frankly,

00:02:58.810 --> 00:03:02.250
in nine months, we were able to
demonstrate with this group of patients,

00:03:02.250 --> 00:03:06.710
that the claims that were made in
the initial study were not holding up,

00:03:06.710 --> 00:03:08.610
that the progression was continuing.

00:03:08.610 --> 00:03:11.830
There was no indication that the
progression was slowing as a result of

00:03:11.830 --> 00:03:12.399
using the product.

00:03:13.500 --> 00:03:18.090
So we took that opportunity to suggest
that this was an environment within

00:03:18.090 --> 00:03:21.350
which patients who are activated and
interested in participating in research

00:03:21.350 --> 00:03:24.200
could contribute their data
in a very meaningful way.

00:03:24.200 --> 00:03:25.570
We took it to the next step, however.

00:03:25.570 --> 00:03:28.660
Because we understood that
we have a biased population.

00:03:28.660 --> 00:03:32.470
So our research scientists and data
scientists spent time developing a novel

00:03:32.470 --> 00:03:36.570
algorithm where they could match
patients who were using Lithium

00:03:36.570 --> 00:03:40.320
with patients who actually had a similar
disease course but were not on Lithium.

00:03:40.320 --> 00:03:44.650
So they were able to create a control
group, that actually then was

00:03:44.650 --> 00:03:48.700
useful in being able to support the
report that we ultimately showed, which

00:03:48.700 --> 00:03:53.406
was that Lithium really did not have
an impact on the progression of ALS.

00:03:53.406 --> 00:03:56.060
In fact you know, for
some patient's it could have been

00:03:56.060 --> 00:03:58.890
a concern because they were actually
taking a drug that might have had

00:03:58.890 --> 00:04:01.960
adverse effects that they didn't
necessarily need to incur.

00:04:01.960 --> 00:04:06.360
It was a great opportunity to show the
power of the patient research network.

00:04:06.360 --> 00:04:10.450
&gt;&gt; So, you began with amyotrophic
lateral sclerosis but

00:04:10.450 --> 00:04:12.190
you've certainly expanded
well beyond that.

00:04:12.190 --> 00:04:15.130
Can you tell us about the other
conditions or the number of

00:04:15.130 --> 00:04:18.220
conditions and the number of communities
are now on Patients Like Me.

00:04:18.220 --> 00:04:19.180
&gt;&gt; Sure.

00:04:19.180 --> 00:04:23.420
We currently have about
270,000 patients on the site.

00:04:23.420 --> 00:04:26.380
We cover over 2,000
different conditions.

00:04:26.380 --> 00:04:30.520
Initially when we came out of the first
few years with Patients Like Me,

00:04:30.520 --> 00:04:33.190
we were really relatively
small communities that were

00:04:33.190 --> 00:04:37.290
focusing a lot on these very serious,
neurological conditions similar to ALS.

00:04:37.290 --> 00:04:39.040
With MS and that sort of thing.

00:04:39.040 --> 00:04:41.580
And since then we've really
expanded quite a bit.

00:04:41.580 --> 00:04:44.870
So today we have communities
are focused on, Multiple Sclerosis is

00:04:44.870 --> 00:04:47.860
one of our largest communities still,
about 40,000 patients.

00:04:47.860 --> 00:04:50.370
We have a very large community
of fibromyalgia patients.

00:04:50.370 --> 00:04:54.020
Patients for whom the system
isn't necessarily very helpful.

00:04:54.020 --> 00:04:57.010
Because it's such as complex
condition with a lot of symptoms, and

00:04:57.010 --> 00:04:58.919
not a treatment in sight right now.

00:04:59.970 --> 00:05:01.100
Many mood conditions.

00:05:01.100 --> 00:05:03.430
So we have a lot of patients
who are using the site for

00:05:03.430 --> 00:05:07.190
monitoring their depression or
their anxiety disorders.

00:05:07.190 --> 00:05:10.880
But then other conditions such as
epilepsy, rheumatoid arthritis,

00:05:10.880 --> 00:05:14.340
many of those are also in
the thousands of patients.

00:05:14.340 --> 00:05:19.630
We're seeing more and more,
some of the more rare conditions and

00:05:19.630 --> 00:05:23.640
often times, parents coming on to
the sites to start to monitor and

00:05:23.640 --> 00:05:27.010
track their children who have some
unusual and rare conditions as well.

00:05:27.010 --> 00:05:30.850
So, it's really expanded,
just, exponentially, frankly,

00:05:30.850 --> 00:05:34.010
from where we began and it's very
exciting to have the opportunity to

00:05:34.010 --> 00:05:36.660
have so
many different conditions represented.

00:05:36.660 --> 00:05:39.510
&gt;&gt; Well this is a health
informatics course, and

00:05:39.510 --> 00:05:42.590
I know from discussions we've had
in the past that there is a lot of

00:05:42.590 --> 00:05:46.640
informatics sitting under this beautiful
user friendly, non technical site.

00:05:46.640 --> 00:05:50.980
Can you tell us a bit about what it
takes to actually make this thing work?

00:05:50.980 --> 00:05:53.710
&gt;&gt; Sure it does take
a lot of engineering.

00:05:53.710 --> 00:05:57.210
Much of our company,
we have about 80 staff now.

00:05:57.210 --> 00:06:00.510
Much of our company are engineers,
software developers,

00:06:00.510 --> 00:06:03.460
designers, user experience specialists.

00:06:03.460 --> 00:06:07.560
Then we also have the other side of
the house which is research scientists,

00:06:07.560 --> 00:06:12.290
data scientist and clinicians, who are
trying to bring the two worlds together,

00:06:12.290 --> 00:06:14.780
very much in health IT perspective.

00:06:14.780 --> 00:06:18.500
So on the clinical side, for example, we
actually take all of the data that comes

00:06:18.500 --> 00:06:21.660
in from patients, and we actually
code that against the standardized

00:06:21.660 --> 00:06:24.260
terminologies that you would find in
an electronic health record for example.

00:06:24.260 --> 00:06:25.630
&gt;&gt; Can you tell us which ones?

00:06:25.630 --> 00:06:28.740
&gt;&gt; Sure, we actually code against most
of the ones that you would imagine.

00:06:28.740 --> 00:06:32.540
So ICD, SNOMED, we use mEDRA for
side effect data,

00:06:32.540 --> 00:06:36.200
which is what the pharmaceutical
industry as well as the FDA uses for

00:06:36.200 --> 00:06:38.000
monitoring adverse events.

00:06:38.000 --> 00:06:41.480
We use Multum database right now for
our drug database.

00:06:41.480 --> 00:06:44.130
But we're moving more
towards using RxNorm.

00:06:44.130 --> 00:06:46.940
Again another one of the standardized
terminologies that's within

00:06:46.940 --> 00:06:49.110
the UMLS library.

00:06:49.110 --> 00:06:52.910
So we try very much to
use existing standardized

00:06:52.910 --> 00:06:56.240
databases in order to be able to
normalize our data in some way.

00:06:56.240 --> 00:07:01.420
So that it ultimately could be able to
be interoperable with other systems.

00:07:01.420 --> 00:07:04.980
Right now that's not as transparent
on the site as you might imagine, but

00:07:04.980 --> 00:07:07.700
when you go behind the scenes,
we can then begin to look at

00:07:07.700 --> 00:07:11.370
how many ways have people
talked about their symptom,

00:07:11.370 --> 00:07:13.850
against a particular
specific clinical concept.

00:07:13.850 --> 00:07:16.930
And there could be 30 different
ways that patients actually express

00:07:16.930 --> 00:07:18.620
one clinical concept.

00:07:18.620 --> 00:07:22.140
So, that's actually contributing to
the development of a patient vocabulary

00:07:22.140 --> 00:07:24.450
that actually maps back
to clinical concepts.

00:07:24.450 --> 00:07:29.280
And there's probably close to eight or
9,000 terms in there now that are in

00:07:29.280 --> 00:07:32.600
patient's voice that we've actually
then mapped to clinical concepts.

00:07:32.600 --> 00:07:33.190
&gt;&gt; Super.

00:07:34.310 --> 00:07:38.350
I know you've recently, we talked
earlier about clinical research, and

00:07:38.350 --> 00:07:42.080
you emphasized that the Lithium study
really isn't a controlled trial,

00:07:42.080 --> 00:07:43.120
in the classic sense.

00:07:43.120 --> 00:07:45.950
But you guys are helping your users,

00:07:45.950 --> 00:07:49.320
your patients find and get involved
in clinical trials, I understand.

00:07:49.320 --> 00:07:50.600
Can you tell us about that?

00:07:50.600 --> 00:07:52.280
&gt;&gt; I can.
And we have a few ways of doing that.

00:07:52.280 --> 00:07:56.090
One is that we download every night,
the data from cliinicaltrials.gov.

00:07:56.090 --> 00:07:58.830
And so a patient can look at their
profile the next morning and see,

00:07:58.830 --> 00:08:02.160
based on their profile data, which
trials they actually matched against,

00:08:02.160 --> 00:08:03.740
within 25 miles of their home.

00:08:03.740 --> 00:08:05.930
Gives them a place to begin.

00:08:05.930 --> 00:08:09.250
Then we've also just recently
announced a service that we're

00:08:09.250 --> 00:08:11.460
going to be provided to
the pharmaceutical industry.

00:08:11.460 --> 00:08:13.090
It's called Trial Access.

00:08:13.090 --> 00:08:16.150
We've learned from our patients through
surveys that we've done with them,

00:08:16.150 --> 00:08:19.690
that many of them have been invited
to participate in trials, and

00:08:19.690 --> 00:08:22.310
many of them have not been
satisfied with the experience of

00:08:22.310 --> 00:08:24.140
those who actually did participate.

00:08:24.140 --> 00:08:28.760
Sometimes it's because there wasn't
enough patient-oriented consideration

00:08:28.760 --> 00:08:30.600
into what it took to
participate in a trial.

00:08:30.600 --> 00:08:34.840
So what we've learned is that by having
this service called Trial Access,

00:08:34.840 --> 00:08:37.659
we're actually going to be
helping patients participate

00:08:37.659 --> 00:08:40.789
in the development of trials,
right from the very start.

00:08:40.789 --> 00:08:45.110
So they're better able to say, this
particular intervention is going to be

00:08:45.110 --> 00:08:47.650
very inconvenient for
me to be able to do.

00:08:47.650 --> 00:08:49.010
Had you considered that?

00:08:49.010 --> 00:08:52.310
Now another way of being able
to state that could be, if

00:08:52.310 --> 00:08:56.810
I'm going to have to have a blood sample
drawn, we need to determine how far away

00:08:56.810 --> 00:09:00.210
I'm going to need to go to get that, or
can someone come to my home and do that?

00:09:00.210 --> 00:09:03.607
So there's different ways that patients
can actually contribute practical advice

00:09:03.607 --> 00:09:05.435
to the child development [CROSS_TALK].

00:09:05.435 --> 00:09:07.194
&gt;&gt; So patient-centered clinical trials.

00:09:07.194 --> 00:09:07.731
&gt;&gt; Absolutely.

00:09:07.731 --> 00:09:08.415
&gt;&gt; A new concept.

00:09:08.415 --> 00:09:09.930
&gt;&gt; All the way through the system.

00:09:09.930 --> 00:09:12.690
And actually even also to the point
where they are participating in

00:09:12.690 --> 00:09:14.370
the evaluation of that trial.

00:09:14.370 --> 00:09:15.130
How did it go?

00:09:15.130 --> 00:09:17.825
And being able to get some
findings back to them.

00:09:17.825 --> 00:09:20.005
Right now,
you participate in a clinical trial and

00:09:20.005 --> 00:09:22.625
you never know what the outcomes
of that trial were.

00:09:22.625 --> 00:09:26.995
And if you have access to a journal, you
might be able to find the publication at

00:09:26.995 --> 00:09:29.215
some point, but
much of that data isn't published.

00:09:29.215 --> 00:09:30.955
What we're saying, and
we're suggesting, and

00:09:30.955 --> 00:09:34.475
we're hoping, that the industry
really begins to embrace.

00:09:34.475 --> 00:09:35.925
Patients need to have some feedback.

00:09:35.925 --> 00:09:38.745
There needs to be a mechanism that
if I've contributed my data and

00:09:38.745 --> 00:09:40.440
I'm participating in this study.

00:09:40.440 --> 00:09:42.350
I'd like to have some sense
of how it all went and

00:09:42.350 --> 00:09:45.020
how it did contribute to new knowledge.

00:09:45.020 --> 00:09:48.190
&gt;&gt; Well great, so that sort of leads
to my last question, which is,

00:09:48.190 --> 00:09:50.770
I'm going to ask you to
get out your crystal ball.

00:09:50.770 --> 00:09:55.120
What do you see as the future
of Patients Like Me,

00:09:55.120 --> 00:09:58.080
at least that you can discuss?

00:09:58.080 --> 00:09:59.590
And specifically,

00:09:59.590 --> 00:10:03.590
and I'm not sure I know the answer
to this one, as I'll be interested.

00:10:03.590 --> 00:10:08.280
How do you see Patients Like Me
being involved in VDT, the move for

00:10:08.280 --> 00:10:11.190
patients to be able to upload
their electronic records and

00:10:11.190 --> 00:10:14.140
share their data with each other and
with other clinicians?

00:10:14.140 --> 00:10:15.850
Well, we have a lot of
exciting things going on.

00:10:15.850 --> 00:10:19.390
And some of the projects that
we're currently working on

00:10:19.390 --> 00:10:20.440
are very much about that.

00:10:20.440 --> 00:10:23.300
We're doing some testing and
piloting of sensors and

00:10:23.300 --> 00:10:24.960
mobile devices and wearables.

00:10:24.960 --> 00:10:27.910
Trying to figure out ways of being able
to give patients the opportunity to have

00:10:27.910 --> 00:10:31.360
access to these devices, bringing
that data into our platform, and then

00:10:31.360 --> 00:10:34.390
ultimately finding a way of bringing
that data into the clinical records, so

00:10:34.390 --> 00:10:35.080
it can be useful.

00:10:35.080 --> 00:10:38.200
But there's a lot that you, as you might
imagine, that goes along with that.

00:10:38.200 --> 00:10:40.320
We need to think about how
do we standardize that data,

00:10:40.320 --> 00:10:42.590
how do we understand how
to code that data so,

00:10:42.590 --> 00:10:45.640
we're just really beginning to learn and
those projects are just launched.

00:10:45.640 --> 00:10:48.800
We've just actually sent out the
packages to the patient participants, so

00:10:48.800 --> 00:10:52.470
they can start to do that
active data collection.

00:10:52.470 --> 00:10:56.080
We see the platform as being an
environment where patients can truly be

00:10:56.080 --> 00:11:00.490
a part of the changing healthcare
system in an area where we've

00:11:00.490 --> 00:11:04.340
never really had access to their voice
in such a systematic way before.

00:11:04.340 --> 00:11:07.050
And we believe that, actually,
that contribution will

00:11:07.050 --> 00:11:10.420
really help us achieve the promise of
a continuously learning health system.

00:11:10.420 --> 00:11:14.220
Without that voice, we're sort of
operating in a bit of a vacuum.

00:11:14.220 --> 00:11:18.220
So we are continuing to build
the platform with that in mind.

00:11:18.220 --> 00:11:22.570
We hope, within the next year or so,
to really have the ability to have that

00:11:22.570 --> 00:11:27.825
interoperability data exchange, so that
we might be able to pull in data from

00:11:27.825 --> 00:11:31.450
an EHR record, to unburden the patient
from having to enter all that data in.

00:11:31.450 --> 00:11:33.330
But you know,
there's another facet to that.

00:11:33.330 --> 00:11:35.200
The patient can also verify the data.

00:11:35.200 --> 00:11:35.860
&gt;&gt; Exactly.

00:11:35.860 --> 00:11:39.130
&gt;&gt; And really reconcile
the medication list for example,

00:11:39.130 --> 00:11:44.150
as part of the helping to then
achieve something that an electronic

00:11:44.150 --> 00:11:45.960
health record holder needs to do.

00:11:45.960 --> 00:11:47.760
They need to reconcile
the medication record and

00:11:47.760 --> 00:11:49.320
this is a way of being able to do that.

00:11:49.320 --> 00:11:53.330
So there's a variety of ways that we see
our ability to be able to take advantage

00:11:53.330 --> 00:11:57.360
of that kind of view, download and
transmit type of technology.

00:11:57.360 --> 00:11:59.460
But we want it to be bidirectional.

00:11:59.460 --> 00:12:01.320
Let's get data going back and forth.

00:12:01.320 --> 00:12:05.030
So that ultimately each record is
a reflection of the full 360 view of

00:12:05.030 --> 00:12:06.870
the patient.

00:12:06.870 --> 00:12:09.120
&gt;&gt; You raise a really interesting point.

00:12:09.120 --> 00:12:12.350
I was at a talk recently from
someone at the Geisinger Clinic.

00:12:12.350 --> 00:12:14.620
Which is a very well known
health system in Pennsylvania.

00:12:14.620 --> 00:12:16.810
And they have an open chart initiative,

00:12:16.810 --> 00:12:19.310
which allows patients to
see their actual charts.

00:12:19.310 --> 00:12:22.780
And one of the benefits they've
seen is that patients find and

00:12:22.780 --> 00:12:23.910
help them correct mistakes.

00:12:23.910 --> 00:12:25.300
&gt;&gt; Errors, exactly.

00:12:25.300 --> 00:12:27.100
You know, it's really very common for

00:12:27.100 --> 00:12:30.660
something to be on a record that isn't
quite accurate, or for a patient to see

00:12:30.660 --> 00:12:35.010
a medication that they may have taken,
ten years ago, but no longer take, and

00:12:35.010 --> 00:12:39.240
be able to say to the doctor, this is
not accurate let's fix it together.

00:12:39.240 --> 00:12:41.860
One of the things I've been playing
around with is this equation, and

00:12:41.860 --> 00:12:46.207
I've been talking about it a lot lately,
and that's this notion of shared data.

00:12:46.207 --> 00:12:51.800
So my data as a patient, your data
as a clinician, our data together.

00:12:51.800 --> 00:12:55.470
Actually can, when you add that into
a shared decision making model,

00:12:55.470 --> 00:12:58.620
ultimately leads to a shared
accountability for the outcomes.

00:12:58.620 --> 00:13:01.490
So that we actually all have
the opportunity to share in

00:13:01.490 --> 00:13:03.410
the ways that I can improve my health.

00:13:03.410 --> 00:13:06.070
I can have my health be more
reflective of what matters to me.

00:13:06.070 --> 00:13:09.270
But at the same time I'm understanding
the kinds of things that are,

00:13:09.270 --> 00:13:12.540
a clinician needs to know in order
to be able to take better care of

00:13:12.540 --> 00:13:13.980
the needs that I have so.

00:13:13.980 --> 00:13:15.430
&gt;&gt; Well as soon as I
get back to Atlanta,

00:13:15.430 --> 00:13:18.520
I'm going to encourage our
friend Marla to sign up.

00:13:18.520 --> 00:13:21.700
So if you see a woman with a lot
of problems named Marla sign up,

00:13:21.700 --> 00:13:23.700
you should know that I sent her to you.

00:13:23.700 --> 00:13:27.190
&gt;&gt; Well the other thing to keep in mind
with that in mind is that the site has

00:13:27.190 --> 00:13:31.680
levels of privacy that allow a patient
to use a username or their real name.

00:13:31.680 --> 00:13:36.380
But I would want to be sure that people
do know that we do take great strides to

00:13:36.380 --> 00:13:40.370
be sure that the experience for patients
is safe, they can trust the site,

00:13:40.370 --> 00:13:43.040
they can feel comfortable about
being able to exchange information.

00:13:43.040 --> 00:13:45.390
&gt;&gt; Students know who Marly is,
you don't.

00:13:45.390 --> 00:13:46.440
&gt;&gt; I don't [LAUGH].

00:13:46.440 --> 00:13:47.330
&gt;&gt; Thank you very much.

00:13:47.330 --> 00:13:48.290
&gt;&gt; Oh, thank you.

00:13:48.290 --> 00:13:49.010
&gt;&gt; Great talking to you.
