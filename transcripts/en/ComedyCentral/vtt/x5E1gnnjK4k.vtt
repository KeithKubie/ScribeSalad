00:00:47.915 --> 00:00:49.550
NOW CAN YOU DO A HANDS-FREE?

&gt;&gt; YEAH.

00:00:53.287 --> 00:00:56.924
I THINK REALLY HARD AND THEN --

00:00:56.957 --> 00:00:58.759
&gt;&gt; Chris: WHAT ABOUT THESE TWO
LAUGHING OFFICERS.

00:00:58.792 --> 00:01:02.196

00:01:02.229 --> 00:01:03.897
THESE ARE YOUR TWO BUDDIES HERE.

00:01:03.931 --> 00:01:09.303
YOU'VE GOT THE CARD UP THERE.

00:01:09.336 --> 00:01:11.271
YOU'RE GOT NUMBER ONE.

00:01:11.305 --> 00:01:13.640
&gt;&gt; CHRIS, THAT'S MY REACTION
WHEN THEY ASK WOULD LIKE

00:01:13.674 --> 00:01:17.544
UNLIMITED BREADSTICKS.

00:01:17.578 --> 00:01:18.946
WHO ARE THEY KIDDING? OF COURSE
I DO.

00:01:18.979 --> 00:01:20.214
&gt;&gt; Chris: OKAY, POINTS. CHOBOT.

00:01:20.247 --> 00:01:22.115
&gt;&gt; THAT'S MY REACTION WHEN
SOMEONE SAYS THEY GO TO A STAR

00:01:22.149 --> 00:01:24.751
TREK CONVENTION AND THEN GOT
LAID.

00:01:24.785 --> 00:01:29.423
&gt;&gt; Chris: NO. THAT WOULD BE

THAT'S MY REACTION WHEN MATT
TELLS ME HE'S SEEING "CHAPPIE"

00:01:33.727 --> 00:01:35.762
ALL WEEKEND.

00:01:35.796 --> 00:01:36.463
NEXT ONE.

00:01:36.496 --> 00:01:38.165
WHAT ABOUT THIS SILVER FOX.

00:01:40.734 --> 00:01:42.169
YES, KEVIN.

00:01:42.202 --> 00:01:44.571
&gt;&gt; THAT WOULD BE MY REACTION
WHEN SOMEONE TELLS ME COMEDY

00:01:44.605 --> 00:01:49.676
CENTRAL ROAST OF JUSTIN BIEBER
DOES NOT NVOLVE FIRE.

00:01:49.710 --> 00:01:52.846
&gt;&gt; Chris: POINTS.

00:01:52.880 --> 00:01:56.116

00:01:56.149 --> 00:01:57.251
MATT MIRA.

00:01:57.284 --> 00:01:58.919

HOW ABOUT THIS MAN CHILD.

00:02:19.873 --> 00:02:21.074
MATT MIRA.

00:02:21.108 --> 00:02:22.609
&gt;&gt; THAT'S MY REACTION WHEN THEY
TRY TO TELL ME WHAT ELSE IN ON

00:02:22.643 --> 00:02:25.479
THE MENU BESIDES BREADSTICKS.

00:02:25.512 --> 00:02:27.915
&gt;&gt; Chris: OKAY, POINTS.

00:02:27.948 --> 00:02:30.884

I HOPE YOU GET [BEEP] WITH A
BREADSTICK BY CHAPPIE.

00:02:37.024 --> 00:02:38.458
&gt;&gt; I JUST WANNA SAY, CHRIS, I
HOPE YOU ALSO ACHIEVE YOUR

00:02:38.492 --> 00:02:42.529

00:02:42.563 --> 00:02:45.632
&gt;&gt; Chris: HE'S RIGHT. HE'S
RIGHT.

00:02:45.666 --> 00:02:46.867
KEVIN.

00:02:46.900 --> 00:02:48.602
&gt;&gt; THAT WAS MY REACTION BEFORE
THE SHOW WHEN MATT WAS LIKE I'M

00:02:48.635 --> 00:02:52.306
COMMITTING TO BREADSTICKS.

00:02:52.339 --> 00:02:56.276
