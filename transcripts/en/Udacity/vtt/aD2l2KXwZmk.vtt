[Dave] So welcome to Homework 1.

00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:04.000
Homework is going to be a little different from quizzes,

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:07.000
so unlike the quizzes where you get instant feedback for each question,

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:10.000
in the homework you'll submit your answers,

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:13.000
and you won't see feedback on them until you submit your answers,

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:16.000
and after the deadline for the homework, we'll be posting answers

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:19.000
and having discussion about the questions.

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:22.000
So for Question 1, we want to see that you understand

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:25.000
how web pages are constructed and what a web crawler will do.

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:28.000
The goal for Question 1 is for you to find all the target links

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:30.000
in the sample web page that we've provided.

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:32.000
So for each potential answer here,

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:35.000
check the box if that corresponds to a URL

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:38.000
that's a target link in the sample page.
