when I was a kid again there were five

when I was a kid again there were five

when I was a kid again there were five
of us and and we would go for walks a

00:00:06.200 --> 00:00:06.210
of us and and we would go for walks a
 

00:00:06.210 --> 00:00:09.740
of us and and we would go for walks a
long long deserted logging roads that

00:00:09.740 --> 00:00:09.750
long long deserted logging roads that
 

00:00:09.750 --> 00:00:12.350
long long deserted logging roads that
wound their way into the hemlock forest

00:00:12.350 --> 00:00:12.360
wound their way into the hemlock forest
 

00:00:12.360 --> 00:00:14.600
wound their way into the hemlock forest
that surrounded Aberdeen and we would

00:00:14.600 --> 00:00:14.610
that surrounded Aberdeen and we would
 

00:00:14.610 --> 00:00:17.240
that surrounded Aberdeen and we would
imagine that we were pioneers explorers

00:00:17.240 --> 00:00:17.250
imagine that we were pioneers explorers
 

00:00:17.250 --> 00:00:19.700
imagine that we were pioneers explorers
that were the first humans that had ever

00:00:25.759 --> 00:00:25.769
terms I suppose but you know I've always
 

00:00:25.769 --> 00:00:27.890

sort of wanted to be an explorer and

00:00:27.890 --> 00:00:27.900
sort of wanted to be an explorer and
 

00:00:27.900 --> 00:00:30.769
sort of wanted to be an explorer and
when I went to Cornell Bob Richardson

00:00:30.769 --> 00:00:30.779
when I went to Cornell Bob Richardson
 

00:00:30.779 --> 00:00:34.250

gave it a talk on a new refrigeration

00:00:34.250 --> 00:00:34.260
gave it a talk on a new refrigeration
 

00:00:34.260 --> 00:00:36.350
gave it a talk on a new refrigeration
technology that gave the promise of

00:00:36.350 --> 00:00:36.360
technology that gave the promise of
 

00:00:36.360 --> 00:00:38.930

allowing man to look at nature in a new

allowing man to look at nature in a new
 

00:00:38.940 --> 00:00:41.540
allowing man to look at nature in a new
and different realm and I wanted to be

00:00:41.540 --> 00:00:41.550
and different realm and I wanted to be
 

00:00:41.550 --> 00:00:44.299
and different realm and I wanted to be
with people and that was what I decided

00:00:44.299 --> 00:00:44.309
with people and that was what I decided
 

00:00:44.309 --> 00:00:45.680
with people and that was what I decided
I would go into low temperature physics

00:00:45.680 --> 00:00:45.690
I would go into low temperature physics
 

00:00:45.690 --> 00:00:48.799
I would go into low temperature physics
so so I I went in with the idea that

00:00:48.799 --> 00:00:48.809
so so I I went in with the idea that
 

00:00:48.809 --> 00:00:50.119
so so I I went in with the idea that
there would be some excitement

00:00:50.119 --> 00:00:50.129
there would be some excitement
 

00:00:50.129 --> 00:00:53.600
there would be some excitement
associated with it and everything but my

00:00:53.600 --> 00:00:53.610
associated with it and everything but my
 

00:00:53.610 --> 00:00:55.549
associated with it and everything but my
fifth year graduate study the experiment

00:00:55.549 --> 00:00:55.559
fifth year graduate study the experiment
 

00:00:55.559 --> 00:00:59.569
fifth year graduate study the experiment
I was doing turned out it was based on

00:00:59.569 --> 00:00:59.579
I was doing turned out it was based on
 

00:00:59.579 --> 00:01:01.729
I was doing turned out it was based on
some very what appeared to be very

00:01:01.729 --> 00:01:01.739
some very what appeared to be very
 

00:01:01.739 --> 00:01:04.340
some very what appeared to be very
exciting work by by one of our

00:01:04.340 --> 00:01:04.350
exciting work by by one of our
 

00:01:04.350 --> 00:01:08.000
exciting work by by one of our
competitors and when I went into to

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:08.010
competitors and when I went into to
 

00:01:08.010 --> 00:01:10.370
competitors and when I went into to
first reproduce that then go beyond it

00:01:10.370 --> 00:01:10.380
first reproduce that then go beyond it
 

00:01:10.380 --> 00:01:13.490
first reproduce that then go beyond it
we found it that that work was all wrong

00:01:13.490 --> 00:01:13.500
we found it that that work was all wrong
 

00:01:13.500 --> 00:01:16.520
we found it that that work was all wrong
and that the actual effect was was

00:01:16.520 --> 00:01:16.530
and that the actual effect was was
 

00:01:16.530 --> 00:01:20.300
and that the actual effect was was
easily calculated and I kept looking for

00:01:20.300 --> 00:01:20.310
easily calculated and I kept looking for
 

00:01:20.310 --> 00:01:24.289
easily calculated and I kept looking for
small deviations from the existing

00:01:24.289 --> 00:01:24.299
small deviations from the existing
 

00:01:24.299 --> 00:01:28.370
small deviations from the existing
theory and and it what I like to say is

00:01:28.370 --> 00:01:28.380
theory and and it what I like to say is
 

00:01:28.380 --> 00:01:30.830
theory and and it what I like to say is
if I'd continued on that experiment I

00:01:30.830 --> 00:01:30.840
if I'd continued on that experiment I
 

00:01:30.840 --> 00:01:34.100
if I'd continued on that experiment I
probably would be a taxicab driver New

00:01:34.100 --> 00:01:34.110
probably would be a taxicab driver New
 

00:01:34.110 --> 00:01:36.950
probably would be a taxicab driver New
York City or something like that but

00:01:36.950 --> 00:01:36.960
York City or something like that but
 

00:01:36.960 --> 00:01:40.010
York City or something like that but
luckily one day there were two other

00:01:40.010 --> 00:01:40.020
luckily one day there were two other
 

00:01:40.020 --> 00:01:42.230
luckily one day there were two other
students that had patiently been waiting

00:01:42.230 --> 00:01:42.240
students that had patiently been waiting
 

00:01:42.240 --> 00:01:46.760
students that had patiently been waiting
for the only NMR iron core electromagnet

00:01:46.760 --> 00:01:46.770
for the only NMR iron core electromagnet
 

00:01:46.770 --> 00:01:49.429
for the only NMR iron core electromagnet
in the lab so high enough homogeneity

00:01:49.429 --> 00:01:49.439
in the lab so high enough homogeneity
 

00:01:49.439 --> 00:01:51.639
in the lab so high enough homogeneity
and stability to do in tomorrow and

00:01:51.639 --> 00:01:51.649
and stability to do in tomorrow and
 

00:01:51.649 --> 00:01:53.840

eventually they went to dave lee and bob

00:01:53.840 --> 00:01:53.850
eventually they went to dave lee and bob
 

00:01:53.850 --> 00:01:56.209
eventually they went to dave lee and bob
richardson and they sort of agreed that

00:01:56.209 --> 00:01:56.219
richardson and they sort of agreed that
 

00:01:56.219 --> 00:01:58.429
richardson and they sort of agreed that
i had to relinquish this magnet which

00:01:58.429 --> 00:01:58.439
i had to relinquish this magnet which
 

00:01:58.439 --> 00:02:00.889
i had to relinquish this magnet which
i'd been monopolizing for three months

00:02:00.889 --> 00:02:00.899
i'd been monopolizing for three months
 

00:02:00.899 --> 00:02:06.020
i'd been monopolizing for three months
and so it was only after that that I did

00:02:06.020 --> 00:02:06.030
and so it was only after that that I did
 

00:02:06.030 --> 00:02:10.249
and so it was only after that that I did
a curiosity driven experiment which in

00:02:10.249 --> 00:02:10.259
a curiosity driven experiment which in
 

00:02:10.259 --> 00:02:12.440
a curiosity driven experiment which in
fact gave the first ever

we were wrong I mean all the data was

we were wrong I mean all the data was
 

00:02:34.590 --> 00:02:37.430
we were wrong I mean all the data was
was correct but but the interpretation

00:02:37.430 --> 00:02:37.440
was correct but but the interpretation
 

00:02:37.440 --> 00:02:39.020
was correct but but the interpretation
was all wrong we'd said it was all in

kept trying to come up with better and
 

00:02:53.400 --> 00:02:56.449
kept trying to come up with better and
better ways of probing what was going on
