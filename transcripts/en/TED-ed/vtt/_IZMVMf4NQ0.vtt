00:00:06.663 --> 00:00:09.040
At Pixar, we're all about telling stories,

00:00:09.040 --> 00:00:11.333
but one story that hasn't been told very much

00:00:11.333 --> 00:00:14.002
is the huge degree to which math is used

00:00:14.002 --> 00:00:15.418
in the production of our films.

00:00:15.418 --> 00:00:16.839
The math that you're learning in

00:00:16.839 --> 00:00:18.387
middle school and high school

00:00:18.387 --> 00:00:20.508
is used all the time at Pixar.

00:00:20.508 --> 00:00:23.095
So, let's start with a very simple example.

00:00:23.095 --> 00:00:26.727
Anybody recognize this guy? (Cheers)

00:00:26.727 --> 00:00:29.305
Yeah, so this is Woody from Toy Story,

00:00:29.305 --> 00:00:31.971
and let's ask Woody to, say, walk across the stage

00:00:31.971 --> 00:00:34.521
from, say, left to right, just like that.

00:00:34.521 --> 00:00:38.888
So, believe it or not, you just saw a ton of mathematics.

00:00:38.888 --> 00:00:40.055
Where is it?

00:00:40.055 --> 00:00:42.114
Well, to explain that,

00:00:42.114 --> 00:00:43.322
it's important to understand

00:00:43.322 --> 00:00:45.076
that artists and designers think in terms of

00:00:45.076 --> 00:00:46.829
shape and images

00:00:46.829 --> 00:00:49.639
but computers think in terms of numbers and equations.

00:00:49.639 --> 00:00:51.222
So, to bridge those two worlds

00:00:51.222 --> 00:00:52.888
we use a mathematical concept called

00:00:52.888 --> 00:00:54.752
coordinate geometry, right?

00:00:54.752 --> 00:00:56.754
That is, we lay down a coordinate system

00:00:56.754 --> 00:01:00.171
with x describing how far something is to the right

00:01:00.171 --> 00:01:02.945
and y describing how high something is.

00:01:02.945 --> 00:01:05.219
So, with these coordinates we can describe

00:01:05.219 --> 00:01:07.554
where Woody is at any instant in time.

00:01:07.554 --> 00:01:09.721
For instance, if we know the coordinates of

00:01:09.721 --> 00:01:11.803
the lower left corner of that image,

00:01:11.803 --> 00:01:13.772
then we know where the rest of the image is.

00:01:13.772 --> 00:01:16.471
And in that little sliding animation we saw a second ago,

00:01:16.471 --> 00:01:18.471
that motion we call translation,

00:01:18.471 --> 00:01:21.473
the x coordinate started with a value of one,

00:01:21.473 --> 00:01:24.306
and it ended with a value of about five.

00:01:24.306 --> 00:01:26.700
So, if we want to write that in mathematics,

00:01:26.700 --> 00:01:30.138
we see that the x at the end is four bigger

00:01:30.138 --> 00:01:32.053
than x at the start.

00:01:32.053 --> 00:01:35.082
So, in other words, the mathematics of translation

00:01:35.082 --> 00:01:36.500
is addition.

00:01:36.500 --> 00:01:37.835
Alright?

00:01:37.835 --> 00:01:38.972
How about scaling?

00:01:38.972 --> 00:01:41.303
That is making something bigger or smaller.

00:01:41.303 --> 00:01:44.138
Any guesses as to what the mathematics of scaling might be?

00:01:44.138 --> 00:01:48.222
Dilation, multiplication, exactly.

00:01:48.222 --> 00:01:49.889
If you're going to make something twice as big,

00:01:49.889 --> 00:01:52.305
you need to mulitply the x and the y coordinates

00:01:52.305 --> 00:01:53.944
all by two.

00:01:53.944 --> 00:01:56.192
So, this shows us that the mathematics of scaling

00:01:56.192 --> 00:01:57.521
is mulitiplication.

00:01:57.521 --> 00:01:58.554
Okay?

00:01:58.554 --> 00:01:59.472
How about this one?

00:01:59.472 --> 00:02:02.722
How about rotation? Alright, spinning around.

00:02:02.722 --> 00:02:06.071
The mathematics of rotation is trigonometry.

00:02:06.071 --> 00:02:08.139
So, here's an equation that expresses that.

00:02:08.139 --> 00:02:09.994
It looks a little scary at first.

00:02:09.994 --> 00:02:12.995
You'll probably get this in eighth or ninth grade.

00:02:12.995 --> 00:02:16.000
If you find yourselves sitting in trigonometry class

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:18.759
wondering when you're ever going to need this stuff,

00:02:18.759 --> 00:02:21.170
just remember that any time you see anything rotate

00:02:21.170 --> 00:02:22.554
in one of our films,

00:02:22.554 --> 00:02:24.806
there's trigonometry at work underneath.

00:02:24.806 --> 00:02:27.176
I first fell in love with mathematics in seventh grade.

00:02:27.176 --> 00:02:29.722
Any seventh graders? A few of you? Yeah.

00:02:29.722 --> 00:02:32.055
My seventh grade science teacher showed me

00:02:32.055 --> 00:02:33.720
how to use trigonometry to compute

00:02:33.720 --> 00:02:36.640
how high the rockets that I was building was going.

00:02:36.640 --> 00:02:38.055
I just thought that was amazing,

00:02:38.055 --> 00:02:41.140
and I've been enamored with math ever since.

00:02:41.140 --> 00:02:42.859
So, this is kind of old mathematics.

00:02:42.859 --> 00:02:44.305
Mathematics that's been known and, you know,

00:02:44.305 --> 00:02:47.140
developed by the old dead Greek guys.

00:02:47.140 --> 00:02:49.221
And there's a myth out there that all the interesting

00:02:49.221 --> 00:02:51.493
mathematics has already been figured out,

00:02:51.493 --> 00:02:54.329
in fact all of mathematics has been figured out.

00:02:54.329 --> 00:02:56.304
But the real story is that new mathematics

00:02:56.304 --> 00:02:58.124
is being created all the time.

00:02:58.124 --> 00:03:00.334
And some of it is being created at Pixar.

00:03:00.334 --> 00:03:02.555
So, I'd like to give you an example of that.

00:03:02.555 --> 00:03:04.172
So, here are some characters

00:03:04.172 --> 00:03:05.888
from some of our early films:

00:03:05.888 --> 00:03:10.434
Finding Nemo, Monsters Inc. and Toy Story 2.

00:03:10.434 --> 00:03:13.682
Anybody know who the blue character in the upper left is?

00:03:13.682 --> 00:03:15.639
It's Dory. Okay, that was easy.

00:03:15.639 --> 00:03:16.602
Here's a little harder one.

00:03:16.602 --> 00:03:19.853
Anybody know who's the character in the lower right?

00:03:19.853 --> 00:03:22.445
Al McWhiggin from Al's Toy Barn, exactly.

00:03:22.445 --> 00:03:24.304
The thing to notice about these characters

00:03:24.304 --> 00:03:25.776
is they're really complicated.

00:03:25.776 --> 00:03:27.778
Those shapes are really complicated.

00:03:27.778 --> 00:03:31.805
In fact, the toy cleaner, I have an example,

00:03:31.805 --> 00:03:34.077
the toy cleaner there in the middle,

00:03:34.077 --> 00:03:35.746
here's his hand.

00:03:35.746 --> 00:03:37.749
You can imagine how fun it was to bring this

00:03:37.749 --> 00:03:40.917
through airport security.

00:03:40.917 --> 00:03:42.837
His hand is a really complicated shape.

00:03:42.837 --> 00:03:45.712
It's not just a bunch of spheres and cylinders stuck together, right?

00:03:45.712 --> 00:03:47.591
And not only is it complicated,

00:03:47.591 --> 00:03:49.727
but it has to move in complicated ways.

00:03:49.727 --> 00:03:51.509
So, I'd like to tell you how we do that,

00:03:51.509 --> 00:03:53.771
and to do that I need to tell you about midpoints.

00:03:53.771 --> 00:03:55.721
So, here's a couple of points, A and B,

00:03:55.721 --> 00:03:57.099
and the line segment between them.

00:03:57.099 --> 00:03:59.304
We're going to start out first in two dimensions.

00:03:59.304 --> 00:04:01.022
The midpoint, M, is the point

00:04:01.022 --> 00:04:03.389
that splits that line segment in the middle, right?

00:04:03.389 --> 00:04:05.108
So, that's the geometry.

00:04:05.108 --> 00:04:06.471
To make equations and numbers,

00:04:06.471 --> 00:04:08.529
we again introduce a coordinate system,

00:04:08.529 --> 00:04:10.472
and if we know the coordinates of A and B,

00:04:10.472 --> 00:04:12.405
we can easily compute the coordinates of M

00:04:12.405 --> 00:04:13.742
just by averaging.

00:04:13.742 --> 00:04:16.245
You now know enough to work at Pixar.

00:04:16.245 --> 00:04:17.578
Let me show you.

00:04:17.578 --> 00:04:19.541
So, I'm going to do something slightly terrifying

00:04:19.541 --> 00:04:22.055
and move to a live demo here.

00:04:22.055 --> 00:04:25.972
So, what I have is a four-point polygon here,

00:04:25.972 --> 00:04:27.088
and it's going to be my job

00:04:27.088 --> 00:04:29.132
to make a smooth curve out of this thing.

00:04:29.132 --> 00:04:31.761
And I'm going to do it just using the idea of midpoints.

00:04:31.761 --> 00:04:32.929
So, the first thing I'm going to do

00:04:32.929 --> 00:04:34.889
is an operation I'll call split,

00:04:34.889 --> 00:04:37.097
which adds midpoints to all those edges.

00:04:37.097 --> 00:04:39.221
So, I went from four points to eight points,

00:04:39.221 --> 00:04:40.518
but it's no smoother.

00:04:40.518 --> 00:04:41.722
I'm going to make it a little bit smoother

00:04:41.722 --> 00:04:44.691
by moving all of these points from where they are now

00:04:44.691 --> 00:04:47.805
to the midpoint of their clockwise neighbor.

00:04:47.805 --> 00:04:49.222
So, let me animate that for you.

00:04:49.222 --> 00:04:51.139
I'm going to call that the averaging step.

00:04:51.139 --> 00:04:52.556
So, now I've got eight points,

00:04:52.556 --> 00:04:53.639
they're a little bit smoother,

00:04:53.639 --> 00:04:55.325
my job is to make a smooth curve,

00:04:55.325 --> 00:04:56.890
so what do I do?

00:04:56.890 --> 00:04:59.077
Do it again. Split and average.

00:04:59.077 --> 00:05:00.997
So, now I've got sixteen points.

00:05:00.997 --> 00:05:02.554
I'm going to put those two steps,

00:05:02.554 --> 00:05:04.169
split and average, together into something

00:05:04.169 --> 00:05:05.616
I'll call subdivide,

00:05:05.616 --> 00:05:07.449
which just means split and then average.

00:05:07.449 --> 00:05:09.262
So, now I've got 32 points.

00:05:09.262 --> 00:05:10.700
If that's not smooth enough, I'll do more.

00:05:10.700 --> 00:05:12.117
I'll get 64 points.

00:05:12.117 --> 00:05:13.971
Do you see a smooth curve appearing here from

00:05:13.971 --> 00:05:15.638
those original points?

00:05:15.638 --> 00:05:17.117
And that's how we create the shapes

00:05:17.117 --> 00:05:19.222
of our charcters.

00:05:19.222 --> 00:05:20.558
But remember, I said a moment ago

00:05:20.558 --> 00:05:23.145
it's not enough just to know the static shape,

00:05:23.145 --> 00:05:24.146
the fixed shape.

00:05:24.146 --> 00:05:25.533
We need to animate it.

00:05:25.533 --> 00:05:27.277
And to animate these curves,

00:05:27.277 --> 00:05:28.900
the cool thing about subdivision.

00:05:28.900 --> 00:05:31.653
Did you see the aliens in Toy Story?

00:05:31.653 --> 00:05:32.534
You know that sound they make,

00:05:32.534 --> 00:05:34.701
"Ooh"? Ready?

00:05:34.701 --> 00:05:36.950
So, the way we animate these curves

00:05:36.950 --> 00:05:41.079
is simply by animating the original four points.

00:05:41.079 --> 00:05:43.666
"Ooh."

00:05:43.666 --> 00:05:46.783
Alright, I think that's pretty cool,

00:05:46.783 --> 00:05:49.086
and if you don't, the door is there,

00:05:49.086 --> 00:05:52.783
it doesn't get any better than that, so.

00:05:52.783 --> 00:05:54.617
This idea of splitting and averaging

00:05:54.617 --> 00:05:56.803
also holds for surfaces.

00:05:56.803 --> 00:06:00.222
So, I'll split, and I'll average.

00:06:00.222 --> 00:06:02.263
I'll split, and I'll average.

00:06:02.263 --> 00:06:03.867
Put those together into subdivide,

00:06:03.867 --> 00:06:05.616
and this how we actually create the shapes

00:06:05.616 --> 00:06:09.106
of all of our surface characters in three dimensions.

00:06:09.106 --> 00:06:10.534
So, this idea of subdivision

00:06:10.534 --> 00:06:13.234
was first used in a short film in 1997

00:06:13.234 --> 00:06:14.821
called Geri's Game.

00:06:14.821 --> 00:06:16.782
And Geri actually made a cameo apperance

00:06:16.782 --> 00:06:19.200
in Toy Story 2 as the toy cleaner.

00:06:19.200 --> 00:06:20.327
Each of his hands

00:06:20.327 --> 00:06:22.868
was the first time we ever used subdivision.

00:06:22.868 --> 00:06:24.667
So, each hand was a subdivision surface,

00:06:24.667 --> 00:06:26.506
his face was a subdivision surface,

00:06:26.506 --> 00:06:27.835
so was his jacket.

00:06:27.835 --> 00:06:29.783
Here's Geri's hand before subdivision,

00:06:29.783 --> 00:06:32.586
and here's Geri's hand after subdivision,

00:06:32.586 --> 00:06:34.590
so subdivision just goes in and smooths out

00:06:34.590 --> 00:06:35.842
all those facets,

00:06:35.842 --> 00:06:37.676
and creates the beautiful surfaces

00:06:37.676 --> 00:06:40.116
that you see on the screen and in the theaters.

00:06:40.116 --> 00:06:43.182
Since that time, we've built all of our characters this way.

00:06:43.182 --> 00:06:46.560
So, here's Merida, the lead character from Brave.

00:06:46.560 --> 00:06:48.313
Her dress was a subdivision surface,

00:06:48.313 --> 00:06:49.482
her hands, her face.

00:06:49.482 --> 00:06:51.200
The faces and hands of all the clansman

00:06:51.200 --> 00:06:52.821
were subdivision surfaces.

00:06:52.821 --> 00:06:55.066
Today we've seen how addition, multiplication,

00:06:55.066 --> 00:06:58.838
trigonometry and geometry play a roll in our films.

00:06:58.838 --> 00:07:00.075
Given a little more time,

00:07:00.075 --> 00:07:01.867
I could show you how linear algebra,

00:07:01.867 --> 00:07:04.662
differential calculus, integral calculus

00:07:04.662 --> 00:07:06.033
also play a roll.

00:07:06.033 --> 00:07:09.200
The main thing I want you to go away with today is

00:07:09.200 --> 00:07:12.117
to just remember that all the math that you're learning

00:07:12.117 --> 00:07:15.090
in high school and actually up through sophomore college

00:07:15.090 --> 00:07:19.925
we use all the time, everyday, at Pixar. Thanks.
