Where on the coordinate plane does this graph lie, then? We know that the

00:00:03.408 --> 00:00:07.791
Asymptotes, which I've drawn here, divide the plane into sections. And we can

00:00:07.791 --> 00:00:11.256
find the graph of the rational function in some of those areas, but not all of

00:00:11.256 --> 00:00:15.539
them. Please check off all the spots that the function will pass through.
