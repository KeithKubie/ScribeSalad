RAJ AJRAWAT: Hi, everyone.

00:00:08.410 --> 00:00:09.840
My name is Raj Ajrawat.

00:00:09.840 --> 00:00:12.840
I'm a product specialist
here at Google Play.

00:00:12.840 --> 00:00:14.230
Welcome to Playtime.

00:00:14.230 --> 00:00:16.270
Thank you all for
being here today.

00:00:16.270 --> 00:00:19.068
I'd like to actually introduce
both Mark and Jim before we

00:00:19.068 --> 00:00:20.110
go ahead and get started.

00:00:20.110 --> 00:00:23.040
So Mark, if you can go ahead
and introduce yourself,

00:00:23.040 --> 00:00:24.267
and we'll go from there.

00:00:24.267 --> 00:00:25.350
MARK PANELO: Hi, everyone.

00:00:25.350 --> 00:00:26.040
I'm Mark Panelo.

00:00:26.040 --> 00:00:29.220
I'm the senior director of
business development at Kabam,

00:00:29.220 --> 00:00:35.690
and I lead platform partnership
strategy and operations.

00:00:35.690 --> 00:00:37.740
JIM STERN: And I'm Jim
Stern, general manager

00:00:37.740 --> 00:00:40.686
of the casual cards
division at Zynga,

00:00:40.686 --> 00:00:43.140
working on global
games like Solitaire

00:00:43.140 --> 00:00:47.220
and Gin Rummy Plus that have
a presence in the emerging

00:00:47.220 --> 00:00:50.040
market, as well as some
games that are just

00:00:50.040 --> 00:00:51.758
in the emerging markets.

00:00:51.758 --> 00:00:53.800
RAJ AJRAWAT: Thank you
both for being here today.

00:00:53.800 --> 00:00:56.140
We're really happy to
have you guys up here.

00:00:56.140 --> 00:00:59.360
So in order to set up the
discussion, the panel,

00:00:59.360 --> 00:01:02.850
for today, I wanted to just
talk about what we mean when

00:01:02.850 --> 00:01:05.280
we talk about emerging markets.

00:01:05.280 --> 00:01:07.650
Now, given the audience,
given the context,

00:01:07.650 --> 00:01:09.510
when we say emerging
markets up here,

00:01:09.510 --> 00:01:13.420
we're talking really any
non-Western, non-US market--

00:01:13.420 --> 00:01:15.420
so essentially the
rest of the world.

00:01:15.420 --> 00:01:18.070
There's a lot of economic
definitions for that.

00:01:18.070 --> 00:01:20.130
And you might have users
in particular countries.

00:01:20.130 --> 00:01:24.935
But really what we mean is any
user that's not US, UK, Canada.

00:01:24.935 --> 00:01:26.310
The other thing
to call out, too,

00:01:26.310 --> 00:01:28.680
is when we were actually
sitting here and talking

00:01:28.680 --> 00:01:31.920
with our team about how we
want to structure the session,

00:01:31.920 --> 00:01:34.800
we wanted to talk more
about how you can find

00:01:34.800 --> 00:01:36.330
success in emerging markets.

00:01:36.330 --> 00:01:39.210
I think it would be a little bit
disingenuous for us to come up

00:01:39.210 --> 00:01:41.460
here and talk about how to
approach an emerging market

00:01:41.460 --> 00:01:44.517
because many of you already
have users that are there,

00:01:44.517 --> 00:01:47.100
and you're either deciding how
to react to them at this moment

00:01:47.100 --> 00:01:50.910
or how to potentially drive
more business from them.

00:01:50.910 --> 00:01:53.580
Now, given all of that, we
have three different things

00:01:53.580 --> 00:01:55.122
that we're going to
be talking about,

00:01:55.122 --> 00:01:57.390
three different topics that
we're going to focus on,

00:01:57.390 --> 00:01:59.860
the first being pricing
and monetization.

00:01:59.860 --> 00:02:03.570
So how do you price your goods
and services to these users?

00:02:03.570 --> 00:02:07.030
What are some strategies or some
challenges that come with that?

00:02:07.030 --> 00:02:10.110
The second one is around
localization, so not just

00:02:10.110 --> 00:02:11.700
translating your
app or your game,

00:02:11.700 --> 00:02:14.460
but being culturally relevant,
being culturally aware

00:02:14.460 --> 00:02:15.820
of your users.

00:02:15.820 --> 00:02:18.060
And then the third one is
the technical challenges.

00:02:18.060 --> 00:02:20.250
What did you what do
you have to overcome

00:02:20.250 --> 00:02:22.170
from a technical
perspective in order

00:02:22.170 --> 00:02:24.730
to launch in a
particular market?

00:02:24.730 --> 00:02:27.150
So starting off with pricing
and monetization, Mark,

00:02:27.150 --> 00:02:29.790
I'd like to actually call
on you, in terms of the work

00:02:29.790 --> 00:02:32.670
that you guys have done
in terms of pricing.

00:02:32.670 --> 00:02:34.830
Give us a sense for
some of the challenges

00:02:34.830 --> 00:02:38.010
you guys faced when it comes
to how you sell your goods,

00:02:38.010 --> 00:02:41.280
how you sell your games
to users in those markets.

00:02:41.280 --> 00:02:44.130
What were some ideas that you
guys started off with, and then

00:02:44.130 --> 00:02:46.710
what were some solutions
that you went forward with?

00:02:46.710 --> 00:02:48.030
MARK PANELO: Yeah, sure.

00:02:48.030 --> 00:02:52.230
So at Kabam, we pride ourselves
on a really robust live ops

00:02:52.230 --> 00:02:53.760
program and strategy.

00:02:53.760 --> 00:02:57.480
And included in that is a
lot of different strategy

00:02:57.480 --> 00:02:59.850
that we try to implement,
especially with pricing--

00:02:59.850 --> 00:03:03.300
pricing sensitivity
analysis and testing.

00:03:03.300 --> 00:03:06.340
For example, for
India and for Brazil,

00:03:06.340 --> 00:03:09.720
not only do we have our standard
global pricing on our paywall,

00:03:09.720 --> 00:03:11.730
but we actually put low
price entry points--

00:03:11.730 --> 00:03:13.920
IEP entry points--
that's a little bit more

00:03:13.920 --> 00:03:16.420
affordable for those markets.

00:03:16.420 --> 00:03:18.620
We did see an uplift
in the purchase

00:03:18.620 --> 00:03:20.490
velocity for those
lower-priced IEPs,

00:03:20.490 --> 00:03:21.960
but we thought we could do more.

00:03:21.960 --> 00:03:24.210
So we reached out to Google
Play to see whether or not

00:03:24.210 --> 00:03:27.720
they could help us get more best
practice information for India

00:03:27.720 --> 00:03:28.390
and Brazil.

00:03:28.390 --> 00:03:32.690
So we met with Daniel
in the Brazil team,

00:03:32.690 --> 00:03:34.440
and he actually mentioned
that our pricing

00:03:34.440 --> 00:03:38.310
strategy in the Brazil
market is pretty appropriate.

00:03:38.310 --> 00:03:42.210
Then we talked to [INAUDIBLE]
in the Google India team,

00:03:42.210 --> 00:03:46.020
and she mentioned that
we're still a little bit too

00:03:46.020 --> 00:03:47.710
expensive for that region.

00:03:47.710 --> 00:03:53.090
So what we did is, instead of
putting a sub-$1.00 pricing--

00:03:53.090 --> 00:03:55.110
USD pricing
equivalent-- in India,

00:03:55.110 --> 00:03:56.610
we did something a
little bit lower.

00:03:56.610 --> 00:03:59.310
We did a 10 rupee
offer, which equates

00:03:59.310 --> 00:04:02.520
to around like $0.15 USD.

00:04:02.520 --> 00:04:04.020
And while it was
priced really low,

00:04:04.020 --> 00:04:05.580
we did make it up in volume, to.

00:04:05.580 --> 00:04:09.010
So there is no one-size-fits-all
for emerging markets,

00:04:09.010 --> 00:04:11.460
but we just got to test
different price points.

00:04:11.460 --> 00:04:12.627
RAJ AJRAWAT: Yeah, for sure.

00:04:12.627 --> 00:04:14.363
And Jim, with you guys
as well, with some

00:04:14.363 --> 00:04:15.780
of the markets
you're approaching,

00:04:15.780 --> 00:04:17.290
how did you think about that?

00:04:17.290 --> 00:04:18.720
JIM STERN: Yeah, so let's
kind of take a look at it

00:04:18.720 --> 00:04:20.550
from a different
perspective, which is just

00:04:20.550 --> 00:04:23.520
taking a look at what the
cultural and worldwide events

00:04:23.520 --> 00:04:26.380
are that are going on that
you have to be aware of.

00:04:26.380 --> 00:04:29.280
So for example, with
our games in Turkey,

00:04:29.280 --> 00:04:32.920
there is Ramadan and Eid,
which is very important.

00:04:32.920 --> 00:04:35.880
And so we want to
make sure that--

00:04:35.880 --> 00:04:37.980
we want to encourage the
gameplay during that time

00:04:37.980 --> 00:04:38.480
period.

00:04:38.480 --> 00:04:41.110
So we'll put special sales
on during that time period,

00:04:41.110 --> 00:04:43.722
but won't run any
special UA campaigns

00:04:43.722 --> 00:04:45.930
because we know we won't
that get that kind of return

00:04:45.930 --> 00:04:48.040
during that time period.

00:04:48.040 --> 00:04:51.280
And then other
things like VAT tax--

00:04:51.280 --> 00:04:53.550
at the beginning of
the year, we started

00:04:53.550 --> 00:04:58.150
charging VAT on top of all
of the packages that we had.

00:04:58.150 --> 00:05:00.600
And we had to be really aware
of what the impact of that

00:05:00.600 --> 00:05:03.830
was going to be on the players,
especially on the lower

00:05:03.830 --> 00:05:05.580
end, the entry points.

00:05:05.580 --> 00:05:07.850
Because on the
Google side at least,

00:05:07.850 --> 00:05:09.810
there's no pricing
tiers so we can actually

00:05:09.810 --> 00:05:11.425
set up whatever we need to.

00:05:11.425 --> 00:05:12.800
And on the Apple
side, there are.

00:05:12.800 --> 00:05:16.815
So we have to figure
out what kinds of items

00:05:16.815 --> 00:05:18.940
we want to put in there
that will entice them more,

00:05:18.940 --> 00:05:21.210
or how we even pop
up those messages

00:05:21.210 --> 00:05:24.210
to get some of those
early players on board.

00:05:24.210 --> 00:05:27.020
And then I'd say finally,
one other global perspective

00:05:27.020 --> 00:05:30.100
is, do you even take a
look at the local currency.

00:05:30.100 --> 00:05:32.850
So in the case of Turkey,
where we've got a big presence,

00:05:32.850 --> 00:05:36.610
over this last year, there's
been a huge devaluation

00:05:36.610 --> 00:05:37.350
in the market.

00:05:37.350 --> 00:05:39.100
And what you need to
take a look at there,

00:05:39.100 --> 00:05:41.622
then, is how do you
make sure that you're

00:05:41.622 --> 00:05:43.330
being sensitive to
what's going on there.

00:05:43.330 --> 00:05:45.240
Do you put on sales?

00:05:45.240 --> 00:05:48.400
Do you actually reprice what
you're doing at that time?

00:05:48.400 --> 00:05:50.800
Or do you try to come up
with alternative packages

00:05:50.800 --> 00:05:53.620
like rewarded videos,
where they don't

00:05:53.620 --> 00:05:55.270
have to spend as
much during the time

00:05:55.270 --> 00:05:59.950
where the lira's a lot
lower, and really make sure

00:05:59.950 --> 00:06:02.110
that they're able to
still continue to play.

00:06:02.110 --> 00:06:03.250
RAJ AJRAWAT: So I want
to actually follow up

00:06:03.250 --> 00:06:03.820
on that, too.

00:06:03.820 --> 00:06:05.140
So this is interesting.

00:06:05.140 --> 00:06:07.935
You're having to think about,
like, geopolitical issues that

00:06:07.935 --> 00:06:10.060
are happening around the
world to understand, like,

00:06:10.060 --> 00:06:12.100
currency devaluation.

00:06:12.100 --> 00:06:15.130
What did you guys decide
to do in that moment?

00:06:15.130 --> 00:06:17.050
Did you move with
rewarded video?

00:06:17.050 --> 00:06:18.730
Did you change the pricing?

00:06:18.730 --> 00:06:20.530
How did you actually
react to that?

00:06:20.530 --> 00:06:22.258
JIM STERN: No, so
what we figured was

00:06:22.258 --> 00:06:23.800
it was really
important to watch what

00:06:23.800 --> 00:06:25.060
was going on in the market.

00:06:25.060 --> 00:06:27.130
And because these are
lower price point entry,

00:06:27.130 --> 00:06:30.160
it doesn't really impact that
part of the business as much.

00:06:30.160 --> 00:06:32.600
So we decided to wait and
see what would happen.

00:06:32.600 --> 00:06:35.050
And things actually
turned out fine in terms

00:06:35.050 --> 00:06:36.950
of what players
were interested in

00:06:36.950 --> 00:06:39.987
and being able to
engage in the game.

00:06:39.987 --> 00:06:42.320
And it's the one piece that
I think is really important.

00:06:42.320 --> 00:06:44.110
Don't react quickly,
and don't say,

00:06:44.110 --> 00:06:46.240
OK, I'm going to reprice
everything right away.

00:06:46.240 --> 00:06:49.990
Sit, wait, see what's going
to happen, and make sure

00:06:49.990 --> 00:06:52.307
that you're really listening
to what the players want.

00:06:52.307 --> 00:06:53.390
RAJ AJRAWAT: That's great.

00:06:53.390 --> 00:06:55.630
And Mark, I wanted to
actually touch on something

00:06:55.630 --> 00:06:57.700
you were talking
about previously.

00:06:57.700 --> 00:07:00.250
We gave you guys advice
around what kind of pricing

00:07:00.250 --> 00:07:02.710
makes sense in
particular markets.

00:07:02.710 --> 00:07:04.990
Have you done any
testing beyond that,

00:07:04.990 --> 00:07:06.985
in terms of maybe
even adjusting up

00:07:06.985 --> 00:07:09.370
or below what we talked
about previously?

00:07:09.370 --> 00:07:12.190
Or has there been any
sort of A/B testing

00:07:12.190 --> 00:07:14.060
that you guys have
done with that?

00:07:14.060 --> 00:07:16.170
MARK PANELO: I mean,
we A/B test everything.

00:07:16.170 --> 00:07:18.143
But outside of
pricing, we actually

00:07:18.143 --> 00:07:19.810
do-- because, like,
we create the Marvel

00:07:19.810 --> 00:07:23.080
Contest of Champions game, we
know what characters resonate

00:07:23.080 --> 00:07:24.290
in certain markets as well.

00:07:24.290 --> 00:07:27.130
So we actually do when
we look at our offers

00:07:27.130 --> 00:07:28.900
that we do in those
different markets,

00:07:28.900 --> 00:07:30.400
we actually look
at which characters

00:07:30.400 --> 00:07:33.380
and which packages makes
more sense for that reason.

00:07:33.380 --> 00:07:34.900
So we do outside pricing.

00:07:34.900 --> 00:07:39.550
We do tailor it culturally,
too, for the market.

00:07:39.550 --> 00:07:41.650
RAJ AJRAWAT: So taking
that discussion now,

00:07:41.650 --> 00:07:45.010
I'd actually like to transition
to this idea of localization.

00:07:45.010 --> 00:07:47.828
So probably about six years
ago or five years ago,

00:07:47.828 --> 00:07:49.870
I would have just told
you to translate your app,

00:07:49.870 --> 00:07:51.760
and then call it a day.

00:07:51.760 --> 00:07:53.980
That's completely
changed, right?

00:07:53.980 --> 00:07:57.310
It's not just about translating
to Spanish, or Mandarin,

00:07:57.310 --> 00:07:57.940
or Portuguese.

00:07:57.940 --> 00:08:01.120
It's about running
sales during Eid,

00:08:01.120 --> 00:08:04.880
or doing something specific
to those particular markets.

00:08:04.880 --> 00:08:07.300
Jim, let's talk about some
of the work you guys did

00:08:07.300 --> 00:08:10.570
with Okey in Turkey,
understanding sort

00:08:10.570 --> 00:08:14.410
of how you guys first
approached that market,

00:08:14.410 --> 00:08:17.500
thought about the way you wanted
to set up the game, and then

00:08:17.500 --> 00:08:20.470
some of the things that you did
in terms of actually delivering

00:08:20.470 --> 00:08:21.592
content to users there.

00:08:21.592 --> 00:08:23.550
It'd be great to just
walk through all of that.

00:08:23.550 --> 00:08:24.700
JIM STERN: OK.

00:08:24.700 --> 00:08:30.040
Yeah, Okey as a tile-based gin
game, similar to Rummicube.

00:08:30.040 --> 00:08:31.490
And it's very popular.

00:08:31.490 --> 00:08:33.610
It's very traditional in
their card houses there.

00:08:33.610 --> 00:08:36.850
So people have been
playing it for years.

00:08:36.850 --> 00:08:39.429
And they play socially,
they play for money.

00:08:39.429 --> 00:08:42.740
There's a lot that goes on
around that as a community.

00:08:42.740 --> 00:08:45.370
So we figured, let's tap
into something that actually

00:08:45.370 --> 00:08:46.840
resonates with that community.

00:08:46.840 --> 00:08:49.180
There are 80 million
or so people in Turkey,

00:08:49.180 --> 00:08:53.300
and there's a large portion that
actually play the game as well.

00:08:53.300 --> 00:08:56.490
So our first
important thing to do

00:08:56.490 --> 00:09:00.010
is make sure that we had
synchronous gameplay, just

00:09:00.010 --> 00:09:00.850
set it up that way.

00:09:00.850 --> 00:09:02.225
How do you make
it so that people

00:09:02.225 --> 00:09:05.590
can get on-- two players,
three players, four players.

00:09:05.590 --> 00:09:08.827
On top of that, we then added
community and customer service.

00:09:08.827 --> 00:09:11.410
And with the customer service,
it was important to have people

00:09:11.410 --> 00:09:14.330
who were from Turkey, not only
how to speak the language--

00:09:14.330 --> 00:09:16.330
like I said, you don't
worry about, necessarily,

00:09:16.330 --> 00:09:17.950
just the translation--

00:09:17.950 --> 00:09:20.410
but really understood
the mentality

00:09:20.410 --> 00:09:23.632
of people who play the game
and what they're looking for.

00:09:23.632 --> 00:09:25.840
And then we finally added
a component on top of that,

00:09:25.840 --> 00:09:27.730
where they can wager
for chips and really

00:09:27.730 --> 00:09:31.620
get that additional
excitement around it.

00:09:31.620 --> 00:09:34.120
And what was important, I think,
throughout this whole thing

00:09:34.120 --> 00:09:37.660
was the timing, the
pacing of the game,

00:09:37.660 --> 00:09:40.450
what the tiles look like,
even your avatar and canned

00:09:40.450 --> 00:09:43.420
phrases that weren't just
translated through some app,

00:09:43.420 --> 00:09:45.010
but things that
were typically known

00:09:45.010 --> 00:09:47.362
within that particular culture.

00:09:47.362 --> 00:09:49.570
RAJ AJRAWAT: There was one
partner we were talking to

00:09:49.570 --> 00:09:50.980
before the panel.

00:09:50.980 --> 00:09:53.380
And she was mentioning how
they leverage their community

00:09:53.380 --> 00:09:54.170
inside the app.

00:09:54.170 --> 00:09:56.410
So they have a very strong,
passionate user base

00:09:56.410 --> 00:10:00.080
that actually just
volunteer their time.

00:10:00.080 --> 00:10:03.520
They were given a space in terms
of becoming a brand ambassador,

00:10:03.520 --> 00:10:05.170
an app ambassador, for them.

00:10:05.170 --> 00:10:07.810
And they actually reach
out to these users

00:10:07.810 --> 00:10:09.880
in particular markets
as the individual

00:10:09.880 --> 00:10:11.590
that represents that country.

00:10:11.590 --> 00:10:13.720
It makes the user feel
extremely happy to have

00:10:13.720 --> 00:10:15.700
that honor, especially
if they love the service

00:10:15.700 --> 00:10:17.110
or they love the app.

00:10:17.110 --> 00:10:19.210
But they essentially
become a sounding board

00:10:19.210 --> 00:10:22.990
for any changes that can
happen in that local market.

00:10:22.990 --> 00:10:25.660
So much like what we did with
Daniel and [INAUDIBLE] in India

00:10:25.660 --> 00:10:28.875
and in Brazil, they sort
of act as the individual

00:10:28.875 --> 00:10:30.500
that you can reach
out to and say, hey,

00:10:30.500 --> 00:10:32.710
we're trying to get
this message across.

00:10:32.710 --> 00:10:33.890
Does this make sense?

00:10:33.890 --> 00:10:35.890
Is this the right messaging
that we want to say?

00:10:35.890 --> 00:10:37.640
And many times, they'll
actually come back

00:10:37.640 --> 00:10:39.912
and say, no, you mean
to say this instead.

00:10:39.912 --> 00:10:41.620
So it's a good check
on a lot of the work

00:10:41.620 --> 00:10:44.050
that they're doing in terms
of approaching those markets.

00:10:44.050 --> 00:10:46.240
And it's ideally
somewhat lightweight

00:10:46.240 --> 00:10:48.250
in terms of leveraging
those resources,

00:10:48.250 --> 00:10:51.502
leveraging your users to
actually get that information.

00:10:51.502 --> 00:10:52.960
But Mark, how have
you guys thought

00:10:52.960 --> 00:10:55.540
about culturalization,
localization

00:10:55.540 --> 00:10:57.650
for your offerings?

00:10:57.650 --> 00:11:00.820
MARK PANELO: So something
interesting that we do--

00:11:00.820 --> 00:11:06.183
we, Kabam, actually have really
deep roots with UC Berkeley.

00:11:06.183 --> 00:11:08.350
And what we've been doing--
like all of our founders

00:11:08.350 --> 00:11:09.018
came from Cal.

00:11:09.018 --> 00:11:11.310
And what we did with them is
we partnered with the Haas

00:11:11.310 --> 00:11:13.270
Business School to do
a research competition

00:11:13.270 --> 00:11:16.960
to see which markets
outside of the tier 1's

00:11:16.960 --> 00:11:19.240
have the highest
growth potential.

00:11:19.240 --> 00:11:22.130
And there's a bigger
opportunity there.

00:11:22.130 --> 00:11:26.860
So it's no surprise that both
India and Brazil, as well as

00:11:26.860 --> 00:11:30.040
Southeast Asia came
up in the research.

00:11:30.040 --> 00:11:32.328
So right now, we're
actually moving to phase 2.

00:11:32.328 --> 00:11:33.870
And in phase 2,
actually, we're going

00:11:33.870 --> 00:11:36.640
to be partnering with
an university in India

00:11:36.640 --> 00:11:40.240
to go a little bit more deeper
on, not only just the game

00:11:40.240 --> 00:11:42.785
market over there, but also
the game tech and the player

00:11:42.785 --> 00:11:43.762
profile.

00:11:43.762 --> 00:11:45.220
And the reason why
we're doing that

00:11:45.220 --> 00:11:47.860
with the university in India
is because we identify them

00:11:47.860 --> 00:11:50.152
as a growth market and
an emerging market,

00:11:50.152 --> 00:11:51.860
those people who are
on the ground there.

00:11:51.860 --> 00:11:53.290
So that's why we
wanted to do that.

00:11:53.290 --> 00:11:54.310
So that's how we're
kind of learning

00:11:54.310 --> 00:11:56.260
from the folks over
there on, the ground.

00:11:56.260 --> 00:11:57.340
RAJ AJRAWAT: Interesting.

00:11:57.340 --> 00:11:58.180
I don't know if
you can say this.

00:11:58.180 --> 00:11:59.680
Is this like a
financial relationship,

00:11:59.680 --> 00:12:01.810
or is it just purely research,
or how is that structured?

00:12:01.810 --> 00:12:02.590
MARK PANELO: Pure research.

00:12:02.590 --> 00:12:04.490
I mean, we're partnering
with universities.

00:12:04.490 --> 00:12:06.170
There's a prize
for whoever wins.

00:12:06.170 --> 00:12:08.150
So it just helps
for their tuition.

00:12:08.150 --> 00:12:09.658
RAJ AJRAWAT: OK, that's great.

00:12:09.658 --> 00:12:11.200
Yeah, so I mean, I
think that there's

00:12:11.200 --> 00:12:13.617
a lot of these different things
to think about when you're

00:12:13.617 --> 00:12:16.330
obviously trying to sell
your specific service

00:12:16.330 --> 00:12:18.010
to these markets.

00:12:18.010 --> 00:12:20.145
I'd like to potentially
now transition

00:12:20.145 --> 00:12:21.520
to some of these
technical issues

00:12:21.520 --> 00:12:24.040
that a lot of our partners face.

00:12:24.040 --> 00:12:27.250
And actually, we were
talking previously,

00:12:27.250 --> 00:12:30.020
the panel, that even
size can be a big issue.

00:12:30.020 --> 00:12:33.790
So Jim, walk us through
some of the technical things

00:12:33.790 --> 00:12:36.100
that you had to think
about before you approached

00:12:36.100 --> 00:12:38.980
the market, or also
just technical issues

00:12:38.980 --> 00:12:41.443
that you might have
encountered after you entered.

00:12:41.443 --> 00:12:43.360
JIM STERN: That we were
surprised about later.

00:12:43.360 --> 00:12:45.060
RAJ AJRAWAT: Right, that
you were surprised about it.

00:12:45.060 --> 00:12:46.360
How did you react to them?

00:12:46.360 --> 00:12:48.610
How did you guys
build in flex to be

00:12:48.610 --> 00:12:52.790
able to address those issues
for your users as well?

00:12:52.790 --> 00:12:55.600
JIM STERN: So we had a couple
of different things going

00:12:55.600 --> 00:12:58.190
on with a few of our games.

00:12:58.190 --> 00:13:01.660
So in the case of Okey
that I was talking about,

00:13:01.660 --> 00:13:04.090
it's predominantly
played in Turkey.

00:13:04.090 --> 00:13:08.690
And the closest AWS server that
we could get was in Germany.

00:13:08.690 --> 00:13:10.720
So there was some
latency issues--

00:13:10.720 --> 00:13:11.750
not horrible.

00:13:11.750 --> 00:13:13.690
But we were able to
find servers that

00:13:13.690 --> 00:13:16.870
were local within Turkey
that were price-competitive

00:13:16.870 --> 00:13:19.360
as well, that actually
were much better in terms

00:13:19.360 --> 00:13:20.390
of the latency issue.

00:13:20.390 --> 00:13:23.570
So we were able to hook
them up over there.

00:13:23.570 --> 00:13:27.010
We've also had situations
like with Poker

00:13:27.010 --> 00:13:29.230
where we thought, OK,
this is a global game how

00:13:29.230 --> 00:13:32.870
do we target the particular
emerging markets?

00:13:32.870 --> 00:13:36.130
Let's segment the
servers based off

00:13:36.130 --> 00:13:38.380
of the different languages
of the different countries

00:13:38.380 --> 00:13:39.850
where the people are playing.

00:13:39.850 --> 00:13:42.940
And we found that actually
had an issue on liquidity,

00:13:42.940 --> 00:13:46.180
that people weren't able to
find other players because they

00:13:46.180 --> 00:13:47.740
were on different servers.

00:13:47.740 --> 00:13:50.320
So to accommodate for
that, we put everybody back

00:13:50.320 --> 00:13:53.090
into a single set
of servers again.

00:13:53.090 --> 00:13:56.650
And in order to customize
the game for them,

00:13:56.650 --> 00:14:00.753
we tried to give them
customized events

00:14:00.753 --> 00:14:02.920
that we would customize for
that particular culture,

00:14:02.920 --> 00:14:04.295
but then make
something else that

00:14:04.295 --> 00:14:07.930
was a little bit more generic
for the rest of the world.

00:14:07.930 --> 00:14:12.970
And then in the case of Rangoli
Rekha, which is a match 3

00:14:12.970 --> 00:14:16.810
game that we did in India,
it was very important

00:14:16.810 --> 00:14:18.910
that we knew the customer base.

00:14:18.910 --> 00:14:20.920
So it's predominantly Android.

00:14:20.920 --> 00:14:23.530
So we focused on Android.

00:14:23.530 --> 00:14:27.640
They don't have the
same access to Wi-Fi,

00:14:27.640 --> 00:14:30.150
so we had to make sure that
the file size was down,

00:14:30.150 --> 00:14:32.780
so we kept it 20 megs.

00:14:32.780 --> 00:14:35.500
And based on the research
that we had done,

00:14:35.500 --> 00:14:38.050
we found that up to
40% of the people

00:14:38.050 --> 00:14:42.160
find other fileshare servers
to go to download the game.

00:14:42.160 --> 00:14:45.370
So we made sure it was
accessible through services

00:14:45.370 --> 00:14:48.820
like FireShare in
order for them to be

00:14:48.820 --> 00:14:50.650
able to download their games.

00:14:50.650 --> 00:14:52.150
RAJ AJRAWAT: Now,
Mark, did you guys

00:14:52.150 --> 00:14:54.400
have any similar issues around
size or anything like that?

00:14:54.400 --> 00:14:56.067
Or is that a consideration
for you guys?

00:14:56.067 --> 00:14:58.420
JIM STERN: It's definitely
a huge consideration.

00:14:58.420 --> 00:15:03.130
So four years ago, when Marvin
Contest of Champions launched,

00:15:03.130 --> 00:15:05.315
players actually had
to be on Wi-Fi in order

00:15:05.315 --> 00:15:06.190
to download the game.

00:15:06.190 --> 00:15:07.700
The game is huge.

00:15:07.700 --> 00:15:11.860
I would probably say, on device,
it's around like 700 megabytes.

00:15:11.860 --> 00:15:14.110
So you can see that could
be a hurdle for acquisition.

00:15:14.110 --> 00:15:18.190
So shortly after that, we had to
quickly pivot our central tech

00:15:18.190 --> 00:15:19.460
strategy.

00:15:19.460 --> 00:15:21.550
So what we did is we
made our initial download

00:15:21.550 --> 00:15:22.960
sub-100 megabytes.

00:15:22.960 --> 00:15:25.210
And what that did for
us is it enabled players

00:15:25.210 --> 00:15:28.300
to download the
game over cellular.

00:15:28.300 --> 00:15:30.377
And while they're playing
through the tutorial,

00:15:30.377 --> 00:15:31.960
our game leverages
on-demand resources

00:15:31.960 --> 00:15:33.920
to download the
rest of the package.

00:15:33.920 --> 00:15:36.270
So not only did we
see optimization

00:15:36.270 --> 00:15:38.200
in our yields and
our CPIs, but also it

00:15:38.200 --> 00:15:40.980
made our game more accessible
in the emerging markets where

00:15:40.980 --> 00:15:43.680
the infrastructure wasn't
really fully developed

00:15:43.680 --> 00:15:45.697
and Wi-Fi wasn't
readily available.

00:15:45.697 --> 00:15:47.280
RAJ AJRAWAT: Yeah,
and I mean, I think

00:15:47.280 --> 00:15:49.738
that highlights a lot of what
we were talking about earlier

00:15:49.738 --> 00:15:53.790
today, when you saw Dom up here
on stage, why we're so focused

00:15:53.790 --> 00:15:55.530
on size reduction.

00:15:55.530 --> 00:15:57.570
You can see the
benefits around actually

00:15:57.570 --> 00:15:58.970
taking this type of model--

00:15:58.970 --> 00:16:02.490
a more modular approach, more
dynamically loading content.

00:16:02.490 --> 00:16:04.590
And that's really why
we built the bundle.

00:16:04.590 --> 00:16:07.010
That's why we built
that technology.

00:16:07.010 --> 00:16:08.558
And I can't reiterate
that enough.

00:16:08.558 --> 00:16:10.350
I think we've seen a
lot of partners report

00:16:10.350 --> 00:16:13.388
to us how important that's
been for their business.

00:16:13.388 --> 00:16:15.930
I mean, just something so simple
as size reduction can really

00:16:15.930 --> 00:16:17.460
drive that.

00:16:17.460 --> 00:16:20.082
Now, were there any
technical challenges

00:16:20.082 --> 00:16:22.290
that you had to overcome
through that size reduction,

00:16:22.290 --> 00:16:25.170
or through that kind of like
dynamically-loading information

00:16:25.170 --> 00:16:28.172
that maybe you could
share some details on?

00:16:28.172 --> 00:16:29.880
MARK PANELO: In terms
of the actual tech?

00:16:29.880 --> 00:16:30.963
Gosh, I'm not an engineer.

00:16:30.963 --> 00:16:32.710
I really can't tell
you all the details.

00:16:32.710 --> 00:16:36.780
But it was definitely
not an easy process.

00:16:36.780 --> 00:16:38.760
I think the time
that we said we need

00:16:38.760 --> 00:16:40.290
to do this versus
when we actually

00:16:40.290 --> 00:16:42.220
executed was a good six months.

00:16:42.220 --> 00:16:45.030
So I would say if you
guys are starting off

00:16:45.030 --> 00:16:48.960
from a full-package download to
actually changing your strategy

00:16:48.960 --> 00:16:51.390
and doing an initial
download, take some time

00:16:51.390 --> 00:16:52.470
to think through it.

00:16:52.470 --> 00:16:52.680
RAJ AJRAWAT: Yeah.

00:16:52.680 --> 00:16:54.513
And so that's a good
thing to call out, too.

00:16:54.513 --> 00:16:56.640
I think when we have
these conversations

00:16:56.640 --> 00:16:59.430
with our partners,
a lot of times

00:16:59.430 --> 00:17:01.890
it's not just a quick change
that you can put into place.

00:17:01.890 --> 00:17:05.140
This is really an architecture
decision at the end of the day.

00:17:05.140 --> 00:17:06.869
And you kind of have
to leverage a lot

00:17:06.869 --> 00:17:09.079
of resources to
make that happen.

00:17:09.079 --> 00:17:11.520
So that kind of definitely
lines up with a lot of things

00:17:11.520 --> 00:17:13.062
that we're talking
to partners about.

00:17:13.062 --> 00:17:17.910
But I'd like to maybe just take
stock of a lot of these ideas.

00:17:17.910 --> 00:17:22.560
And if you could maybe talk
about one or two things

00:17:22.560 --> 00:17:24.810
that you'd want the
audience to take away from,

00:17:24.810 --> 00:17:28.200
something that we can hopefully
take away as an actionable item

00:17:28.200 --> 00:17:32.040
that they can test back home
with some of their colleagues.

00:17:32.040 --> 00:17:34.140
Jim, maybe we'll start with you.

00:17:34.140 --> 00:17:37.740
What are a few things that
you can talk about that

00:17:37.740 --> 00:17:41.440
if you're trying to prioritize
these items and these tasks?

00:17:41.440 --> 00:17:44.430
What are things they
can do to try and find

00:17:44.430 --> 00:17:46.396
success in these markets?

00:17:46.396 --> 00:17:48.880
JIM STERN: I'd say,
first and foremost,

00:17:48.880 --> 00:17:51.600
if you're looking to do
a game or an application

00:17:51.600 --> 00:17:54.120
in a particular market,
make sure you've really

00:17:54.120 --> 00:17:58.200
done your research to know
what are the traditions there,

00:17:58.200 --> 00:18:03.130
what do people glom
onto, why do they do it.

00:18:03.130 --> 00:18:06.100
The more you can actually have
it built there as well, where

00:18:06.100 --> 00:18:09.960
the people know the traditions,
they know the culture,

00:18:09.960 --> 00:18:10.680
it's much better.

00:18:10.680 --> 00:18:13.470
Because even the subtleties
that they put into the game

00:18:13.470 --> 00:18:16.330
make an incredible difference.

00:18:16.330 --> 00:18:19.260
Same-- like I was talking about
before-- customer service,

00:18:19.260 --> 00:18:20.110
have it there.

00:18:20.110 --> 00:18:22.810
They'll understand how
to talk with the people

00:18:22.810 --> 00:18:25.760
there, how to
communicate with them.

00:18:25.760 --> 00:18:28.020
And I wouldn't just
segment it, I guess,

00:18:28.020 --> 00:18:30.910
to creating an app for
a particular market.

00:18:30.910 --> 00:18:33.630
But if you have
a larger app that

00:18:33.630 --> 00:18:38.790
is global, how do you tap
into those emerging markets?

00:18:38.790 --> 00:18:44.760
And in some cases, it is
customizing events, or sales,

00:18:44.760 --> 00:18:47.280
or whatever it is that you
want to put out to them.

00:18:47.280 --> 00:18:48.810
It will cost a little bit more.

00:18:48.810 --> 00:18:51.000
It will take more
time to put together.

00:18:51.000 --> 00:18:53.640
But they value that,
and they really

00:18:53.640 --> 00:18:56.280
enjoy seeing that they're
an important piece to what's

00:18:56.280 --> 00:18:57.850
going on.

00:18:57.850 --> 00:18:59.920
You can also get into
those emerging markets

00:18:59.920 --> 00:19:00.780
if you're worldwide.

00:19:00.780 --> 00:19:03.210
Because like I was talking
about with liquidity,

00:19:03.210 --> 00:19:04.860
there maybe these
smaller countries

00:19:04.860 --> 00:19:06.670
where you don't have--

00:19:06.670 --> 00:19:10.170
it's not profitable enough for
you to build something just

00:19:10.170 --> 00:19:12.120
for that, but you
can tap into it

00:19:12.120 --> 00:19:14.490
by leveraging all the
rest of the other people.

00:19:14.490 --> 00:19:18.360
So don't just ignore
emerging markets

00:19:18.360 --> 00:19:20.730
because you don't think
you can get into it.

00:19:20.730 --> 00:19:22.230
Leverage everything
else that you're

00:19:22.230 --> 00:19:24.420
doing in terms of the
rest of the world.

00:19:24.420 --> 00:19:25.920
RAJ AJRAWAT: Yeah,
and Mark, I think

00:19:25.920 --> 00:19:28.680
if you could give us maybe a few
things to think about as well.

00:19:28.680 --> 00:19:30.360
MARK PANELO: Yeah, I mean, like
from a pricing perspective,

00:19:30.360 --> 00:19:32.400
I would just say
A/B test everything.

00:19:32.400 --> 00:19:35.460
I mean, sometimes the biggest
wins and learnings come out

00:19:35.460 --> 00:19:36.750
of trial and error.

00:19:36.750 --> 00:19:41.220
But I guess my more
general takeaway and advice

00:19:41.220 --> 00:19:43.710
I could give is to don't
be afraid to ask for help,

00:19:43.710 --> 00:19:45.850
and leverage your
external resources,

00:19:45.850 --> 00:19:48.570
whether it's Google Play,
or local universities,

00:19:48.570 --> 00:19:50.730
or even your peers
in the industry.

00:19:50.730 --> 00:19:52.290
Chances are you'll
learn something

00:19:52.290 --> 00:19:54.123
about emerging markets
that you didn't know.

00:19:54.123 --> 00:19:55.432
And the advice is free, too.

00:19:55.432 --> 00:19:56.640
RAJ AJRAWAT: Yep, definitely.

00:19:56.640 --> 00:19:57.810
[CHUCKLING]

00:19:57.810 --> 00:19:58.380
Awesome.

00:19:58.380 --> 00:20:01.840
Well, thank you both for
being up here today--

00:20:01.840 --> 00:20:03.840
super helpful, and we
really appreciate you guys

00:20:03.840 --> 00:20:05.618
sharing this detail.

00:20:05.618 --> 00:20:07.910
And actually, one more thing
I wanted to call out, too.

00:20:07.910 --> 00:20:10.470
So there is a new
feature that we

00:20:10.470 --> 00:20:12.390
had talked about
earlier that's launching

00:20:12.390 --> 00:20:15.420
on the Play Console, which
is called country targeting.

00:20:15.420 --> 00:20:19.920
So for those of you who've used
locale targeting previously,

00:20:19.920 --> 00:20:21.420
you might have had
some issues where

00:20:21.420 --> 00:20:24.030
users, for example
in India, they

00:20:24.030 --> 00:20:26.370
set their phones to English US.

00:20:26.370 --> 00:20:28.680
And so you're not necessarily
able to actually deliver

00:20:28.680 --> 00:20:31.530
content that's specific
to a particular market.

00:20:31.530 --> 00:20:34.140
But we currently have that
in an early access program.

00:20:34.140 --> 00:20:36.520
And so I'd love for
everyone to take a look.

00:20:36.520 --> 00:20:41.290
If you go to
g.co/play/countrytargeting.

00:20:41.290 --> 00:20:46.110
Again, that URL is
g.co/play/countrytargeting.

00:20:46.110 --> 00:20:47.140
Thank you both.

00:20:47.140 --> 00:20:47.470
MARK PANELO: Thanks
for having us.

00:20:47.470 --> 00:20:48.345
JIM STERN: Thank you.

00:20:48.345 --> 00:20:50.520
[APPLAUSE]
