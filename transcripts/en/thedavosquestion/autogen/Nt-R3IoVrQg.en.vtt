00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:10.589
&gt;&gt; Yes, sure, role models are in my view very
very important. At this point and time, the

00:00:10.589 --> 00:00:17.430
Middle East is trying to leap forward and
change it's position within the world structure.

00:00:17.430 --> 00:00:25.970
It's trying to get more, more share, more
weight in the way the world is functioning

00:00:25.970 --> 00:00:34.520
and that's its righful place between the community
of nations. But in order to do that, the Middle

00:00:34.520 --> 00:00:39.360
East has to have enough leadership, has to
have enough resources. It does have enough

00:00:39.360 --> 00:00:45.930
resources and financial capital, but the human
resources are what we need. From that perspective,

00:00:45.930 --> 00:00:52.870
role models are very important, to inspire
the new coming youth. In the next 30/35 years,

00:00:52.870 --> 00:01:01.140
we're going to have 150 million new people,
that's two Egypts. We are basically the youngest

00:01:01.140 --> 00:01:12.560
population on earth in terms of the amount
of youth we have. So this youth is a true

00:01:12.560 --> 00:01:16.380
blessing, but it could also be a curse. We
need to empower these youth by giving them

00:01:16.380 --> 00:01:23.399
more tools, by giving them more role models.
So my answer is definitely yes, role models

00:01:23.399 --> 00:01:23.499
are essential and important.
