00:00:00.901 --> 00:00:03.203
Hawaii, birthplace
of the Kenyan usurper,

00:00:03.237 --> 00:00:05.305
is the first state

00:00:05.339 --> 00:00:07.641
to challenge the new
and improved Trump travel ban.

00:00:07.674 --> 00:00:10.577
My signa... Look, right here.
This is Trump's signature.

00:00:10.611 --> 00:00:12.579
"My signature looks
like a fence!"

00:00:12.613 --> 00:00:14.548
(laughter)

00:00:14.581 --> 00:00:17.651
No one's getting
through that signature.

00:00:17.684 --> 00:00:19.753
Lawyers for the state of Hawaii
took a break

00:00:19.786 --> 00:00:21.321
from drinking pink drinks
through long straws

00:00:21.355 --> 00:00:23.190
on a perfect beach
to ask a federal judge

00:00:23.223 --> 00:00:25.292
for a temporary block
on the travel ban,

00:00:25.325 --> 00:00:27.127
claiming it would result in
the, quote,

00:00:27.160 --> 00:00:29.096
"establishment of religion
in the state of Hawaii

00:00:29.129 --> 00:00:30.364
contrary to its state
constitution,"

00:00:30.397 --> 00:00:32.432
and would, quote,
"inflict immediate damage

00:00:32.466 --> 00:00:33.667
"to Hawaii's economy,
educational institutions,

00:00:33.700 --> 00:00:35.369
and tourism industry."

00:00:35.402 --> 00:00:37.404
Then they climbed
into their Ferraris

00:00:37.437 --> 00:00:39.072
and fishtailed back
to meet Higgins

00:00:39.106 --> 00:00:41.775
for poi
at Robin Masters' estate.

00:00:41.808 --> 00:00:45.245
-(theme to <i>Magnum, P.I.</i> plays)
-(cheers and applause)

00:00:45.279 --> 00:00:49.349
All right, all right,
turn it off. Turn it off.

00:00:49.383 --> 00:00:51.518
These millennials can't handle
<i>Magnum.</i> It's too much for 'em.

00:00:51.552 --> 00:00:53.587
-(laughter)
-I'm (bleep) kidding.

00:00:53.620 --> 00:00:54.755
Play it again! Come on!

00:00:54.788 --> 00:00:58.225
-â™ª -Yeah.
-(applause and cheering)

00:00:58.258 --> 00:00:59.860
All right, turn it off.
Turn it off.

00:00:59.893 --> 00:01:02.129
Turn it off. Turn it off.

00:01:03.397 --> 00:01:05.165
I'm a white guy.

00:01:05.199 --> 00:01:08.202
That's the only time
I get near the word "Magnum."

00:01:08.235 --> 00:01:09.203
(laughter and groaning)

00:01:09.236 --> 00:01:14.107
Just kind of nice to be near it,
to be honest.

00:01:14.141 --> 00:01:16.677
You can tie off the ends, but
it doesn't really do anything.

00:01:16.710 --> 00:01:19.880
(laughter)

00:01:19.913 --> 00:01:21.448
Comedians, this is, of course,

00:01:21.481 --> 00:01:24.585
the Trump administration's
second travel ban.

00:01:24.618 --> 00:01:27.221
The first one got struck down
by those pesky judges

00:01:27.254 --> 00:01:28.422
and their stupid
separation of powers

00:01:28.455 --> 00:01:29.890
and goddamn intimate
understanding

00:01:29.923 --> 00:01:31.458
of the legal system and whatnot.

00:01:31.491 --> 00:01:33.327
So how do you think
this one will shake out?

00:01:33.360 --> 00:01:34.862
How do you think this one
will shake out?

00:01:34.895 --> 00:01:37.364
Anyone can buzz in. Pardis.

00:01:37.397 --> 00:01:39.199
The first travel ban
affected seven Muslim countries.

00:01:39.233 --> 00:01:40.834
People protested.

00:01:40.868 --> 00:01:42.469
The government
heard the protests,

00:01:42.503 --> 00:01:45.439
and now the ban only affects
<i>six</i> countries.

00:01:45.472 --> 00:01:47.908
So, I think
it's gonna go pretty well.

00:01:47.941 --> 00:01:50.177
(laughter)

00:01:50.210 --> 00:01:51.879
-(applause)
-All right, points.

00:01:51.912 --> 00:01:53.447
-Mo.
-That's me.

00:01:53.480 --> 00:01:55.315
So, uh, Iraq is off the list,

00:01:55.349 --> 00:01:57.818
-but now Hawaii is considered
an enemy combatant. -(laughter)

00:01:57.851 --> 00:02:00.287
-That's what's gonna happen.
-HARDWICK: Yeah. Yeah, points.

00:02:00.320 --> 00:02:02.356
-We're gonna attack them any day
now, I feel like. -Absolutely.

00:02:02.389 --> 00:02:03.790
-Yeah. Fahim.
-I think it's great

00:02:03.824 --> 00:02:05.526
what Hawaii is trying to do,
but I don't think

00:02:05.559 --> 00:02:07.361
you're getting a lot
of Muslim visitors to Hawaii.

00:02:07.394 --> 00:02:09.329
Like, Spam is
their number one food.

00:02:09.363 --> 00:02:09.429
-(laughter)
-Yeah.
