00:00:00.760 --> 00:00:03.030
Graph a line that
has a slope that

00:00:03.030 --> 00:00:07.180
is negative and greater than
the slope of the blue line.

00:00:07.180 --> 00:00:09.640
So let's think for a second
about what slope means.

00:00:09.640 --> 00:00:12.680
So if you use the word
slope in your everyday life,

00:00:12.680 --> 00:00:15.220
you're really talking about
how inclined something is,

00:00:15.220 --> 00:00:17.030
like a ski slope.

00:00:17.030 --> 00:00:20.050
So for example, this orange
line isn't inclined at all.

00:00:20.050 --> 00:00:24.140
It's flat, so this one
actually has a slope of 0.

00:00:24.140 --> 00:00:27.860
Another way of thinking
about it is as x increases,

00:00:27.860 --> 00:00:29.370
what is happening to y?

00:00:29.370 --> 00:00:31.740
And you see here that y
isn't changing at all,

00:00:31.740 --> 00:00:34.570
so this orange line right
now has a slope of 0.

00:00:34.570 --> 00:00:36.540
If the orange line
looked like this,

00:00:36.540 --> 00:00:38.600
it now has a positive slope.

00:00:38.600 --> 00:00:41.550
Notice, when x is
negative, your y

00:00:41.550 --> 00:00:43.540
value-- or say when
x is negative 5,

00:00:43.540 --> 00:00:46.580
your y value is here, and
then when x is positive 5,

00:00:46.580 --> 00:00:48.260
your y value has increased.

00:00:48.260 --> 00:00:53.270
As x increases, y is increasing,
so this has a positive slope.

00:00:53.270 --> 00:00:56.050
This has an even more positive
slope, an even more positive

00:00:56.050 --> 00:00:56.860
slope.

00:00:56.860 --> 00:00:59.190
This has an even
more positive slope.

00:00:59.190 --> 00:01:03.120
As x is increasing, the y value
is increasing really fast.

00:01:03.120 --> 00:01:05.150
This line is going
up really fast

00:01:05.150 --> 00:01:08.670
as we move towards the right,
so it's a very positive slope.

00:01:08.670 --> 00:01:11.720
This is less positive,
less positive.

00:01:11.720 --> 00:01:16.510
This is a 0 slope, and then
this is a negative slope.

00:01:16.510 --> 00:01:20.740
Notice, as x is increasing,
the line is going down.

00:01:20.740 --> 00:01:22.770
Your y value is decreasing.

00:01:22.770 --> 00:01:27.310
When x is negative
5, your y is 7.

00:01:27.310 --> 00:01:30.040
Well, when x is 5, your y is 5.

00:01:30.040 --> 00:01:32.260
So x is increased,
but y has gone down,

00:01:32.260 --> 00:01:34.050
so this is a negative slope.

00:01:34.050 --> 00:01:36.135
So they say graph a line
that has a slope that

00:01:36.135 --> 00:01:39.430
is negative and greater than
the slope of the blue line.

00:01:39.430 --> 00:01:42.170
So the blue line also
has a negative slope.

00:01:42.170 --> 00:01:47.280
As x is increasing, your
blue line is going down.

00:01:47.280 --> 00:01:49.380
Over here, when x
has negative values,

00:01:49.380 --> 00:01:51.820
your y value is quite high.

00:01:51.820 --> 00:01:53.640
And here, when x
has positive values,

00:01:53.640 --> 00:01:56.070
your y value has gone
all the way down.

00:01:56.070 --> 00:01:57.840
So this has a
negative slope, but we

00:01:57.840 --> 00:01:59.790
want to have a slope
greater than this one.

00:01:59.790 --> 00:02:01.165
So we still want
to have a-- they

00:02:01.165 --> 00:02:03.340
say graph a line that has
a slope that is negative--

00:02:03.340 --> 00:02:05.900
so my orange line currently
has a negative slope--

00:02:05.900 --> 00:02:08.623
and greater than the
slope of the blue line.

00:02:08.623 --> 00:02:10.039
So it has a negative
slope, but it

00:02:10.039 --> 00:02:12.630
is less negative than this
blue line right over here.

00:02:12.630 --> 00:02:14.755
If I wanted to be more
negative than the blue line,

00:02:14.755 --> 00:02:16.490
I'd have to do
something like that.

00:02:16.490 --> 00:02:19.310
But I want to be negative
but less negative

00:02:19.310 --> 00:02:21.340
than the blue line, so
that would be like that.

00:02:21.340 --> 00:02:24.720
If we wanted a 0 slope, once
again, something like this.

00:02:24.720 --> 00:02:27.340
If we wanted a positive
slope, something like this.

00:02:27.340 --> 00:02:29.660
So once again, negative
slope, less negative

00:02:29.660 --> 00:02:31.440
than the blue line.

00:02:31.440 --> 00:02:33.390
