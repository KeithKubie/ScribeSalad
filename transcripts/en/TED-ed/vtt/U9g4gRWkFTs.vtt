00:00:06.634 --> 00:00:10.923
In 1977, the physicist Edward Purcell

00:00:10.947 --> 00:00:14.174
calculated that if you push
a bacteria and then let go,

00:00:14.198 --> 00:00:16.923
it will stop in about
a millionth of a second.

00:00:16.947 --> 00:00:21.149
In that time, it will have traveled less
than the width of a single atom.

00:00:21.173 --> 00:00:24.640
The same holds true for a sperm
and many other microbes.

00:00:24.664 --> 00:00:27.591
It all has to do with being really small.

00:00:27.615 --> 00:00:31.316
Microscopic creatures inhabit
a world alien to us,

00:00:31.340 --> 00:00:34.699
where making it through an inch of water
is an incredible endeavor.

00:00:34.723 --> 00:00:37.717
But why does size matter
so much for a swimmer?

00:00:37.741 --> 00:00:40.741
What makes the world of a sperm
so fundamentally different

00:00:40.765 --> 00:00:42.597
from that of a sperm whale?

00:00:42.621 --> 00:00:46.079
To find out, we need to dive
into the physics of fluids.

00:00:46.103 --> 00:00:47.931
Here's a way to think about it.

00:00:47.955 --> 00:00:49.831
Imagine you are swimming in a pool.

00:00:49.855 --> 00:00:52.594
It's you and a whole bunch
of water molecules.

00:00:52.618 --> 00:00:57.128
Water molecules outnumber you
a thousand trillion trillion to one.

00:00:57.152 --> 00:01:00.502
So, pushing past them
with your gigantic body is easy,

00:01:00.526 --> 00:01:02.688
but if you were really small,

00:01:02.712 --> 00:01:05.068
say you were about the size
of a water molecule,

00:01:05.092 --> 00:01:07.107
all of a sudden, it's like you're swimming

00:01:07.131 --> 00:01:08.235
in a pool of people.

00:01:08.259 --> 00:01:11.575
Rather than simply swishing by
all the teeny, tiny molecules,

00:01:11.599 --> 00:01:13.533
now every single water molecule

00:01:13.557 --> 00:01:16.045
is like another person
you have to push past

00:01:16.069 --> 00:01:17.354
to get anywhere.

00:01:18.068 --> 00:01:20.955
In 1883, the physicist Osborne Reynolds

00:01:20.979 --> 00:01:23.078
figured out that there is
one simple number

00:01:23.102 --> 00:01:25.992
that can predict how a fluid will behave.

00:01:26.016 --> 00:01:27.540
It's called the Reynolds number,

00:01:27.564 --> 00:01:31.581
and it depends on simple properties
like the size of the swimmer,

00:01:31.605 --> 00:01:33.720
its speed, the density of the fluid,

00:01:33.744 --> 00:01:36.494
and the stickiness,
or the viscosity, of the fluid.

00:01:37.566 --> 00:01:40.718
What this means is that creatures
of very different sizes

00:01:40.742 --> 00:01:42.715
inhabit vastly different worlds.

00:01:42.739 --> 00:01:44.684
For example, because of its huge size,

00:01:44.708 --> 00:01:48.001
a sperm whale inhabits
the large Reynolds number world.

00:01:48.723 --> 00:01:50.105
If it flaps its tail once,

00:01:50.129 --> 00:01:52.486
it can coast ahead
for an incredible distance.

00:01:52.510 --> 00:01:56.184
Meanwhile, sperm live
in a low Reynolds number world.

00:01:56.208 --> 00:01:58.357
If a sperm were to stop flapping its tail,

00:01:58.381 --> 00:02:00.912
it wouldn't even coast past a single atom.

00:02:01.266 --> 00:02:03.607
To imagine what it would
feel like to be a sperm,

00:02:03.631 --> 00:02:06.270
you need to bring yourself down
to its Reynolds number.

00:02:06.294 --> 00:02:09.154
Picture yourself in a tub of molasses
with your arms moving

00:02:09.178 --> 00:02:12.118
about as slow as the minute
hand of a clock,

00:02:12.142 --> 00:02:15.590
and you'd have a pretty good idea
of what a sperm is up against.

00:02:15.614 --> 00:02:17.825
So, how do microbes
manage to get anywhere?

00:02:17.849 --> 00:02:20.162
Well, many don't bother swimming at all.

00:02:20.186 --> 00:02:22.772
They just let the food drift to them.

00:02:22.796 --> 00:02:24.320
This is somewhat like a lazy cow

00:02:24.344 --> 00:02:27.049
that waits for the grass
under its mouth to grow back.

00:02:27.073 --> 00:02:29.017
But many microbes do swim,

00:02:29.041 --> 00:02:31.985
and this is where those
incredible adaptations come in.

00:02:32.009 --> 00:02:35.803
One trick they can use
is to deform the shape of their paddle.

00:02:35.827 --> 00:02:37.526
By cleverly flexing their paddle

00:02:37.550 --> 00:02:41.401
to create more drag on the power stroke
than on the recovery stroke,

00:02:41.425 --> 00:02:44.916
single-celled organisms like paramecia

00:02:44.940 --> 00:02:47.845
manage to inch their way
through the crowd of water molecules.

00:02:47.869 --> 00:02:49.907
But there's an even more
ingenious solution

00:02:49.931 --> 00:02:52.278
arrived at by bacteria and sperm.

00:02:52.786 --> 00:02:55.215
Instead of wagging
their paddles back and forth,

00:02:55.239 --> 00:02:57.335
they wind them like a cork screw.

00:02:57.359 --> 00:02:59.182
Just as a cork screw on a wine bottle

00:02:59.206 --> 00:03:01.968
converts winding motion
into forward motion,

00:03:01.992 --> 00:03:04.805
these tiny creatures
spin their helical tails

00:03:04.829 --> 00:03:06.603
to push themselves forward

00:03:06.627 --> 00:03:10.360
in a world where water
feels as thick as cork.

00:03:10.384 --> 00:03:12.485
Other strategies are even stranger.

00:03:12.509 --> 00:03:14.507
Some bacteria take Batman's approach.

00:03:14.531 --> 00:03:17.227
They use grappling hooks
to pull themselves along.

00:03:17.251 --> 00:03:19.013
They can even use this grappling hook

00:03:19.037 --> 00:03:21.743
like a sling shot
and fling themselves forward.

00:03:21.767 --> 00:03:24.195
Others use chemical engineering.

00:03:24.219 --> 00:03:27.485
H. pylori lives only
in the slimy, acidic mucus

00:03:27.509 --> 00:03:29.234
inside our stomachs.

00:03:29.258 --> 00:03:32.697
It releases a chemical
that thins out the surrounding mucus,

00:03:32.721 --> 00:03:34.650
allowing it to glide through slime.

00:03:34.674 --> 00:03:35.722
Maybe it's no surprise

00:03:35.746 --> 00:03:38.883
that these guys are also responsible
for stomach ulcers.

00:03:39.383 --> 00:03:43.090
So, when you look really closely
at our bodies and the world around us,

00:03:43.114 --> 00:03:45.088
you can see all sorts of tiny creatures

00:03:45.112 --> 00:03:48.957
finding clever ways to get around
in a sticky situation.

00:03:48.981 --> 00:03:52.602
Without these adaptations,
bacteria would never find their hosts,

00:03:52.626 --> 00:03:55.581
and sperms would never
make it to their eggs,

00:03:55.605 --> 00:03:57.938
which means you would never
get stomach ulcers,

00:03:57.962 --> 00:04:00.462
but you would also never be born
in the first place.

00:04:00.486 --> 00:04:01.486
