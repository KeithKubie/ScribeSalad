♪♪

00:00:05.767 --> 00:00:08.567
Narrator: A COMPUTER PROGRAM
GUIDES A PLASMA TORCH

00:00:08.567 --> 00:00:12.667
TO CUT OUT PRECISELY SIZED SLOTS
IN A SHEET OF HIGH-GRADE STEEL.

00:00:12.667 --> 00:00:15.300
THE SLOTS WILL HOUSE
THE ILLUMINATED NUMERALS

00:00:15.300 --> 00:00:17.968
AND INDICATORS LIKE ARROWS.

00:00:17.968 --> 00:00:21.067
A WORKER THEN FEEDS
NARROWER STRIPS OF STEEL

00:00:21.067 --> 00:00:24.901
TO A PRESS THAT BENDS BACK
THE EDGES TO CREATE TABS.

00:00:24.901 --> 00:00:28.334
THESE STRIPS WILL SERVE
AS THE SIDES OF THE SCOREBOARD,

00:00:28.334 --> 00:00:31.300
AND THE TABS WILL BE USED
TO INSTALL THEM.

00:00:31.300 --> 00:00:34.267
HE FASTENS FOUR STRIPS
TO THE BACK PANEL.

00:00:34.267 --> 00:00:37.334
HE THEN ATTACHES
THE PLASMA-CUT FRONT PANEL

00:00:37.334 --> 00:00:40.868
TO COMPLETE THE BASIC STRUCTURE
OF THE SCOREBOARD.

00:00:42.534 --> 00:00:45.033
THE NEXT WORKER
SPRAYS A POWDER-PAINT COATING

00:00:45.033 --> 00:00:48.300
ONTO THE ENTIRE SCOREBOARD.

00:00:48.300 --> 00:00:50.601
THEN IT'S INTO
A GIANT CONVECTION OVEN

00:00:50.601 --> 00:00:54.367
FOR ABOUT 14 MINUTES
TO CURE THE POWDER PAINT.

00:00:54.367 --> 00:00:57.300
THE RESULT
IS A TOUGH POWDER-PAINT SKIN

00:00:57.300 --> 00:00:58.667
THAT WILL MAKE IT POSSIBLE

00:00:58.667 --> 00:01:02.067
FOR THE SCOREBOARD METAL
TO WEATHER THE ELEMENTS.

00:01:02.067 --> 00:01:04.234
THEY ARE NOW READY
FOR WORKING PARTS

00:01:04.234 --> 00:01:06.567
LIKE L.E.D.
LIGHT-STUDDED DIGIT BOARDS,

00:01:06.567 --> 00:01:08.901
A DATA TRANSMITTER,
AND RECEIVER.

00:01:08.901 --> 00:01:11.868
HE CONNECTS THE RECEIVER
TO THE POWER SOURCE

00:01:11.868 --> 00:01:14.534
AND INSTALLS IT
INSIDE THE CABINET.

00:01:14.534 --> 00:01:17.834
THERE ARE SEVERAL LIGHT-STUDDED
DIGIT PLATES ON A SCOREBOARD.

00:01:17.834 --> 00:01:19.968
EACH CAN FLASH ANY NUMBER.

00:01:19.968 --> 00:01:22.601
HE WIRES THEM IN A LOOP,
INTERCONNECTING THEM

00:01:22.601 --> 00:01:25.167
IN WHAT'S KNOWN
AS A DAISY-CHAIN CONFIGURATION.

00:01:25.167 --> 00:01:27.901
HE ALSO PLUGS IN
A RIBBON-STYLE CABLE TO LINK

00:01:27.901 --> 00:01:31.400
THE DIGITS TO THE SCOREBOARD'S
PROCESSING MODULE.

00:01:31.400 --> 00:01:34.267
HE INSERTS THE DIGITS
IN THE SLOTS ON THE FRONT

00:01:34.267 --> 00:01:37.667
AND SHIELDS THEM WITH A SHEET
OF TRANSPARENT POLYCARBONATE.

00:01:37.667 --> 00:01:40.000
HE CONFIRMS
THAT THE WIRING IS GOOD

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:42.267
AND THAT ALL THE NUMBERS
LIGHT UP.

00:01:44.267 --> 00:01:46.767
HE CONNECTS THE WIRELESS
COMPUTER PROCESSING MODULE

00:01:46.767 --> 00:01:50.667
TO THE NUMBERS AND ALSO WIRES IT
TO A POWER SOURCE.

00:01:50.667 --> 00:01:54.100
HE MOUNTS THE MODULE TO A PANEL
THAT WILL THEN BE INSTALLED

00:01:54.100 --> 00:01:56.701
THROUGH THE BACK
OF THE SCOREBOARD CABINET.

00:01:57.901 --> 00:01:59.734
WITH ALL THE LETTERING
NOW IN PLACE,

00:01:59.734 --> 00:02:01.968
THE NUMBERS ON THE BOARD
WILL MEAN SOMETHING

00:02:01.968 --> 00:02:03.968
TO THE CROWDS IN THE STANDS.
