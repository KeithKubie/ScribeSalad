00:00:00.695 --> 00:00:06.850
Okay, this was a tough one. But the answers are the third, the fourth, and the

00:00:06.850 --> 00:00:12.490
last answers. Let's take a look at why that is. Just take the first statement by

00:00:12.490 --> 00:00:16.780
itself. Affected individuals may carry a dominant allele.

00:00:16.780 --> 00:00:19.300
If you're affected, it means you're lactose intolerant,

00:00:19.300 --> 00:00:21.170
so we know you must be homozygous recessive

00:00:21.170 --> 00:00:25.700
or minus minus. Minus minus, is the recessive condition,

00:00:25.700 --> 00:00:28.420
right. This is not having a dominant allele, if

00:00:28.420 --> 00:00:30.920
you had a dominant allele, you would be unaffected, so

00:00:30.920 --> 00:00:34.360
that can't be true. The second statement says, affected

00:00:34.360 --> 00:00:38.060
individuals must carry a dominant allele. Well, no that can't

00:00:38.060 --> 00:00:40.200
be true either right, I mean, because if they

00:00:40.200 --> 00:00:44.210
can't even have one just as a conditional may, we

00:00:44.210 --> 00:00:46.230
know they can't have to have one because that

00:00:46.230 --> 00:00:50.740
would definitely make them unaffected, right. They'd be lactose tolerant.

00:00:50.740 --> 00:00:53.550
Now the third statement says affected individuals must carry

00:00:53.550 --> 00:00:56.490
a recessive allele. The recessive allele in this case is

00:00:56.490 --> 00:00:59.202
the minus and we know that affected individuals are

00:00:59.202 --> 00:01:01.750
minus minus and this is the only way we get

00:01:01.750 --> 00:01:04.590
an affected individual. That it is true, they must

00:01:04.590 --> 00:01:07.210
carry at least one recessive allele because they have to

00:01:07.210 --> 00:01:11.100
have two recessive alleles in fact. So that's true. The

00:01:11.100 --> 00:01:15.550
fourth saying is, unaffected individuals must carry a dominant allele.

00:01:15.550 --> 00:01:18.850
So, look at Kate's brother. Remember before, we

00:01:18.850 --> 00:01:20.680
didn't know what one of those alleles were, but

00:01:20.680 --> 00:01:23.130
we knew for sure that one must be a

00:01:23.130 --> 00:01:27.380
dominant plus allele, because he's unaffected. This is definitely

00:01:27.380 --> 00:01:31.910
true. The fifth statement says unaffected individuals must carry

00:01:31.910 --> 00:01:34.940
a recessive allele. Let's go back to Kate's brother

00:01:34.940 --> 00:01:38.150
again. We don't know exactly which allele he has,

00:01:38.150 --> 00:01:40.820
but we know that he could have either another

00:01:40.820 --> 00:01:44.770
plus allele or minus allele. But, Kate's brother could

00:01:44.770 --> 00:01:48.240
in fact be plus plus. An unaffected individual being

00:01:48.240 --> 00:01:51.480
plus plus. Those are two dominant alleles. So unaffected

00:01:51.480 --> 00:01:55.020
individual don't have to carry a recessive allele. And

00:01:55.020 --> 00:01:58.250
that leads us to our last statement. Unaffected individuals

00:01:58.250 --> 00:02:01.022
may carry a recessive allele. Again we'll come back

00:02:01.022 --> 00:02:03.402
to Kate's brother and say that he could be

00:02:03.402 --> 00:02:05.960
plus plus or plus minus. If he's plus minus,

00:02:05.960 --> 00:02:09.110
then he sure does have a recessive allele. We could

00:02:09.110 --> 00:02:12.280
also look at Kate and her brother's parents and we

00:02:12.280 --> 00:02:15.540
see that they're both unaffected and they do carry a

00:02:15.540 --> 00:02:19.420
recessive allele themselves. So this last statement is in fact true.
