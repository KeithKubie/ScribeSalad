SWAPNEEL KSHETRAMADE:
Hey, everybody.

00:00:02.360 --> 00:00:05.030
My name is Neel and I'm
a program manager over

00:00:05.030 --> 00:00:06.540
at the Google+ team.

00:00:06.540 --> 00:00:09.970
I'm also an author of
this publication on Medium

00:00:09.970 --> 00:00:11.410
called "Storytelling in VR."

00:00:11.410 --> 00:00:16.460
I hope you'll check it out after
you hear what I have to say.

00:00:16.460 --> 00:00:21.209
So after the headset
explosion in 2014-- well,

00:00:21.209 --> 00:00:23.000
the headset announcement
explosion, really,

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:25.980
in 2014-- people
started discovering

00:00:25.980 --> 00:00:27.690
a lot of applications for VR.

00:00:27.690 --> 00:00:31.687
I mean, gaming, education,
sports, communication.

00:00:31.687 --> 00:00:33.270
And they're all good
ones, but the one

00:00:33.270 --> 00:00:36.052
I want to talk about
today is movies, narrative

00:00:36.052 --> 00:00:36.635
entertainment.

00:00:36.635 --> 00:00:38.220
[ONE PERSON CLAPPING]

00:00:38.220 --> 00:00:38.730
Thank you.

00:00:38.730 --> 00:00:39.280
[LAUGHTER]

00:00:39.280 --> 00:00:41.706
One person, thank you.

00:00:41.706 --> 00:00:43.080
But you all should
be interested,

00:00:43.080 --> 00:00:45.480
because movies are big business.

00:00:45.480 --> 00:00:48.450
2015 projected revenues
for filmed entertainment

00:00:48.450 --> 00:00:51.110
about $90 billion US dollars.

00:00:51.110 --> 00:00:53.350
And these are projections.

00:00:53.350 --> 00:00:55.320
Digi-Captial-- take it
with a grain of salt.

00:00:55.320 --> 00:00:57.560
But virtual reality
revenue is projected

00:00:57.560 --> 00:01:00.649
to be around $30
billion by 2020.

00:01:00.649 --> 00:01:02.440
Movies are going to be
a big chunk of that.

00:01:02.440 --> 00:01:04.650
A lot of that is gaming,
sure, and headsets,

00:01:04.650 --> 00:01:07.909
but movies are going to
be a big chunk of that.

00:01:07.909 --> 00:01:09.950
So a lot of people have
been trying to figure out

00:01:09.950 --> 00:01:11.560
how to make movies on VR.

00:01:11.560 --> 00:01:13.520
It's not the
easiest thing to do,

00:01:13.520 --> 00:01:16.090
but there's a bunch of
studios that have come up.

00:01:16.090 --> 00:01:18.630
There's Oculus Story
Studio, there's

00:01:18.630 --> 00:01:21.820
Felix &amp; Paul in New York-- oh,
sorry, they're in Montreal.

00:01:21.820 --> 00:01:23.670
Chris Milk is in
New York, and we've

00:01:23.670 --> 00:01:26.472
got our very own
sort of ATAP Studio.

00:01:26.472 --> 00:01:28.640
If you guys haven't seen
"Help," you have to.

00:01:28.640 --> 00:01:31.210
It's incredible.

00:01:31.210 --> 00:01:34.060
But there's a lot of
problems sort of identified

00:01:34.060 --> 00:01:37.260
with making movies in VR.

00:01:37.260 --> 00:01:40.440
People are trying to apply
the rules of movie-making,

00:01:40.440 --> 00:01:41.890
and they don't really work well.

00:01:41.890 --> 00:01:45.350
I mean, in movies, story
is told through a frame.

00:01:45.350 --> 00:01:49.700
So if you have sort of two
guys having a conversation,

00:01:49.700 --> 00:01:50.690
there's a framing shot.

00:01:50.690 --> 00:01:52.470
And then throughout
the conversation,

00:01:52.470 --> 00:01:55.320
there's cuts to one
person, then the next.

00:01:55.320 --> 00:01:57.560
And there's reaction
shots and all that.

00:01:57.560 --> 00:02:00.550
And suppose an explosion
goes off in the background.

00:02:00.550 --> 00:02:03.650
They pan out and show
you the explosion,

00:02:03.650 --> 00:02:06.190
and then zoom in debris,
the aftermath, reactions,

00:02:06.190 --> 00:02:07.260
all that good stuff.

00:02:07.260 --> 00:02:09.440
It's all in the frame.

00:02:09.440 --> 00:02:12.650
The director tells you what to
see and points the frame at it,

00:02:12.650 --> 00:02:15.510
and that's all you get to see.

00:02:15.510 --> 00:02:19.200
In VR, the viewer is
in your environment.

00:02:19.200 --> 00:02:21.300
There is no frame.

00:02:21.300 --> 00:02:23.440
They're immersed in it.

00:02:23.440 --> 00:02:25.300
They don't know where to look.

00:02:25.300 --> 00:02:28.420
You don't know how to
tell them where to look.

00:02:28.420 --> 00:02:30.940
Without cuts, how are they
going to pay attention?

00:02:30.940 --> 00:02:34.747
If they miss a crucial bit
of the action, what happens?

00:02:34.747 --> 00:02:36.580
I mean, what happens
if there's an explosion

00:02:36.580 --> 00:02:37.996
and they're looking
the other way?

00:02:41.510 --> 00:02:44.750
So let me tell you a story.

00:02:44.750 --> 00:02:48.120
100 years ago, the Lumiere
brothers invented the camera,

00:02:48.120 --> 00:02:52.091
and for the first few
years, they didn't really

00:02:52.091 --> 00:02:53.090
know what to do with it.

00:02:53.090 --> 00:02:54.940
I mean, there were little
films like a train pulling

00:02:54.940 --> 00:02:56.940
into a station, which was
literally just a train

00:02:56.940 --> 00:02:58.800
pulling into a station.

00:02:58.800 --> 00:03:01.840
Or there were market scenes,
scenes of everyday life,

00:03:01.840 --> 00:03:05.310
some slapstick comedy.

00:03:05.310 --> 00:03:09.400
And in 1903, this guy
called Edwin Porter,

00:03:09.400 --> 00:03:12.590
he worked with Edison, he made
a movie called "The Great Train

00:03:12.590 --> 00:03:13.450
Robbery."

00:03:13.450 --> 00:03:16.560
It's a 12-minute movie
about these four bandits

00:03:16.560 --> 00:03:19.310
who hold up a train, and
they're killed in the shootout

00:03:19.310 --> 00:03:20.740
afterwards.

00:03:20.740 --> 00:03:22.750
It was remarkable
for two reasons.

00:03:22.750 --> 00:03:27.270
One, it was the first
complete story told on film.

00:03:27.270 --> 00:03:31.060
I mean, Edwin Porter invented
a new sort of visual language

00:03:31.060 --> 00:03:32.230
for how to tell stories.

00:03:32.230 --> 00:03:36.560
He had cuts, he had cross-cuts
between different locations,

00:03:36.560 --> 00:03:39.219
he had camera angles, and
movements, and close-ups.

00:03:39.219 --> 00:03:40.760
And towards the end,
there was a shot

00:03:40.760 --> 00:03:43.250
where the lead bandit
essentially just fires

00:03:43.250 --> 00:03:44.450
a gun at the audience.

00:03:44.450 --> 00:03:46.430
And for somebody used
to watching live plays,

00:03:46.430 --> 00:03:47.264
I mean, that's huge.

00:03:47.264 --> 00:03:49.305
I mean, somebody is firing
a gun straight at you,

00:03:49.305 --> 00:03:50.370
but it was a movie.

00:03:50.370 --> 00:03:52.910
It was incredible.

00:03:52.910 --> 00:03:55.100
And the second reason
the movie is remarkable

00:03:55.100 --> 00:03:58.810
is because it kick-started the
global movie industry we know

00:03:58.810 --> 00:04:00.640
today, with the
Hollywood, the Bollywood,

00:04:00.640 --> 00:04:03.830
and all the other
woods around the world.

00:04:03.830 --> 00:04:07.850
So indirectly, Edwin Porter is
responsible for "Star Wars,"

00:04:07.850 --> 00:04:09.650
"Game of Thrones,"
and "Breaking Bad."

00:04:09.650 --> 00:04:10.950
So you've got him to thank.

00:04:13.560 --> 00:04:15.660
Let me-- oh, there we go.

00:04:15.660 --> 00:04:19.670
So the VR movie really needs
its train robbery moment.

00:04:19.670 --> 00:04:23.140
We need to figure out
how to make this happen.

00:04:23.140 --> 00:04:24.620
Let me skip ahead a little bit.

00:04:24.620 --> 00:04:29.010
So what are the key
elements of a VR experience?

00:04:29.010 --> 00:04:30.260
I'd say there are two of them.

00:04:30.260 --> 00:04:33.210
One is that it's immersive.

00:04:33.210 --> 00:04:36.960
You have a headset covering
your eyes, your ears.

00:04:36.960 --> 00:04:38.730
Down the line, you
could have body suits

00:04:38.730 --> 00:04:40.370
that let you feel
what's happening

00:04:40.370 --> 00:04:41.480
inside the environment.

00:04:41.480 --> 00:04:43.870
People are coming up with
treadmills and spheres

00:04:43.870 --> 00:04:46.060
and stuff like that.

00:04:46.060 --> 00:04:49.520
All these are accessories, and
I know that a lot of consumers

00:04:49.520 --> 00:04:50.510
don't have them.

00:04:50.510 --> 00:04:53.180
But this is a vision
talk, so I don't

00:04:53.180 --> 00:04:56.240
have to talk about
practical concentrations.

00:04:56.240 --> 00:04:59.370
Point is, let content
drive adoption.

00:04:59.370 --> 00:05:01.879
Make good movies and then
people will buy stuff just

00:05:01.879 --> 00:05:02.670
to watch the movie.

00:05:05.740 --> 00:05:08.390
And the second one
is interactivity.

00:05:08.390 --> 00:05:11.670
So it's great to be
immersed in a scene,

00:05:11.670 --> 00:05:15.680
but it's not engaging
unless you can interact

00:05:15.680 --> 00:05:17.650
with it in a meaningful way.

00:05:17.650 --> 00:05:20.950
And there's a lot of ways that
we can sort of get signals

00:05:20.950 --> 00:05:25.450
from viewers-- track their eye
movements, track their hands.

00:05:25.450 --> 00:05:28.789
If they say something, sort
of see what they're saying.

00:05:28.789 --> 00:05:30.330
Maybe down the line,
you have sensors

00:05:30.330 --> 00:05:36.630
that can track temperature,
blood pressure, even heart

00:05:36.630 --> 00:05:38.780
rate, brain activity,
I don't know.

00:05:38.780 --> 00:05:40.780
All of that could go
into sort of customizing

00:05:40.780 --> 00:05:45.720
the experience just a
little bit for every viewer.

00:05:45.720 --> 00:05:51.320
Now, I don't mean to say
that it should be a game

00:05:51.320 --> 00:05:54.720
or a choose-your-own-adventure
kind of situation.

00:05:54.720 --> 00:05:55.530
That's not it.

00:05:55.530 --> 00:05:56.590
You're telling a story.

00:05:56.590 --> 00:05:58.340
There has to be an overall arc.

00:05:58.340 --> 00:06:01.470
There has to be conflict, drama,
characters you can relate to,

00:06:01.470 --> 00:06:03.990
an inciting incident,
escalating, tension,

00:06:03.990 --> 00:06:06.200
resolution, and all
that good stuff.

00:06:06.200 --> 00:06:08.090
But you can have
interactivity in small ways.

00:06:08.090 --> 00:06:10.350
For instance, that conversation
we were talking about,

00:06:10.350 --> 00:06:11.810
two people at a table.

00:06:11.810 --> 00:06:14.510
Now, what if one of
them or both of them

00:06:14.510 --> 00:06:17.400
occasionally glance across
at this third person,

00:06:17.400 --> 00:06:19.900
the viewer, who is sitting
at the table with them?

00:06:19.900 --> 00:06:24.429
Or somebody cracks a joke
and nudges the third person,

00:06:24.429 --> 00:06:26.720
and that person feels it
through their haptic body suit

00:06:26.720 --> 00:06:27.980
or something like that.

00:06:27.980 --> 00:06:31.846
It's the little things that
go towards increasing presence

00:06:31.846 --> 00:06:33.470
and making the viewer
feel like they're

00:06:33.470 --> 00:06:35.839
a part of the experience.

00:06:35.839 --> 00:06:37.630
Another way we could
do that, for instance,

00:06:37.630 --> 00:06:42.536
is let viewers be a
character in the story.

00:06:42.536 --> 00:06:44.410
I just want to play this
little clip for you.

00:06:44.410 --> 00:06:47.170
This is from a cut scene
from the "Arkham Knight."

00:06:47.170 --> 00:06:48.140
Watch this cop.

00:06:50.810 --> 00:06:51.690
He's our character.

00:06:51.690 --> 00:06:53.230
And as he walks
towards the diner,

00:06:53.230 --> 00:06:59.250
the camera sort of swoops in
and essentially becomes him.

00:06:59.250 --> 00:07:01.430
From that point on,
you're seeing everything

00:07:01.430 --> 00:07:03.060
through his eyes.

00:07:03.060 --> 00:07:04.310
He's a character in the scene.

00:07:04.310 --> 00:07:06.700
The viewer is now a
character in the scene.

00:07:06.700 --> 00:07:09.470
Other characters come
up and talk to him

00:07:09.470 --> 00:07:11.130
and stuff like that.

00:07:11.130 --> 00:07:15.540
This is just different ways
of presenting the story.

00:07:15.540 --> 00:07:21.240
It's ideas, but I hope you
guys will sort of altogether

00:07:21.240 --> 00:07:22.870
come up with this
new visual language

00:07:22.870 --> 00:07:27.100
that we need to make virtual
reality movies really

00:07:27.100 --> 00:07:27.600
compelling.

00:07:27.600 --> 00:07:28.099
Hang on.

00:07:28.099 --> 00:07:29.180
Let me get out of this.

00:07:29.180 --> 00:07:29.763
This is stuck.

00:07:33.792 --> 00:07:35.244
Ah, there we go.

00:07:38.632 --> 00:07:39.960
There we don't go.

00:07:39.960 --> 00:07:42.730
Hm.

00:07:42.730 --> 00:07:43.230
Anyway.

00:07:49.830 --> 00:07:53.310
Point is, the thing
with movies and movies

00:07:53.310 --> 00:07:58.090
today is that it's the same
experience for everybody.

00:07:58.090 --> 00:08:02.080
It's filmed once and everybody
sees the exact same movie

00:08:02.080 --> 00:08:05.202
for as long as it's there.

00:08:05.202 --> 00:08:10.175
There's nothing customized
to the individual.

00:08:10.175 --> 00:08:12.380
A virtual reality
viewer has a headset on.

00:08:12.380 --> 00:08:14.600
It's a viewership of one.

00:08:14.600 --> 00:08:17.390
We should be able to
take this opportunity

00:08:17.390 --> 00:08:19.910
to sort of make it a unique
experience for that viewer,

00:08:19.910 --> 00:08:22.070
have them come back and
have different experiences

00:08:22.070 --> 00:08:23.750
every time they come back.

00:08:23.750 --> 00:08:27.672
So good luck and--

00:08:27.672 --> 00:08:29.660
[LAUGHTER]

00:08:29.660 --> 00:08:30.980
Thank you.

00:08:30.980 --> 00:08:34.980
[APPLAUSE]

00:08:34.980 --> 00:08:38.230
[MUSIC PLAYING]
