00:00:04.580 --> 00:00:07.330
Imagine we are living
in prehistoric times.

00:00:07.330 --> 00:00:09.510
Now, consider the following.

00:00:09.510 --> 00:00:12.870
How did we keep track
of time without a clock?

00:00:12.870 --> 00:00:15.650
All clocks are based on some
repetitive pattern which

00:00:15.650 --> 00:00:18.980
divides the flow of time
into equal segments.

00:00:18.980 --> 00:00:20.730
To find these
repetitive patterns,

00:00:20.730 --> 00:00:23.060
we look towards the heavens.

00:00:23.060 --> 00:00:26.310
The sun rising and falling
each day is the most obvious.

00:00:26.310 --> 00:00:28.960
However, to keep track of
longer periods of time,

00:00:28.960 --> 00:00:30.980
we looked for longer cycles.

00:00:30.980 --> 00:00:32.659
For this we looked
to the moon, which

00:00:32.659 --> 00:00:36.650
seemed to gradually grow
and shrink over many days.

00:00:36.650 --> 00:00:39.080
When we count the number
of days between full moons,

00:00:39.080 --> 00:00:40.960
we arrive at the number 29.

00:00:40.960 --> 00:00:42.980
This is the origin of a month.

00:00:42.980 --> 00:00:46.090
However, if we try to
divide 29 into equal pieces,

00:00:46.090 --> 00:00:47.700
we run into a problem.

00:00:47.700 --> 00:00:49.320
It is impossible.

00:00:49.320 --> 00:00:51.730
The only way to divide
29 into equal pieces

00:00:51.730 --> 00:00:54.780
is to break it back
down into single units.

00:00:54.780 --> 00:00:57.050
29 is a prime number.

00:00:57.050 --> 00:00:58.930
Think of it as unbreakable.

00:00:58.930 --> 00:01:02.160
If a number can be broken
down into equal pieces greater

00:01:02.160 --> 00:01:04.780
than one, we call it
a composite number.

00:01:04.780 --> 00:01:07.870
Now, if we are curious, we may
wonder how many prime numbers

00:01:07.870 --> 00:01:10.430
are there, and how
big do they get?

00:01:10.430 --> 00:01:13.800
Let's start by dividing all
numbers into two categories.

00:01:13.800 --> 00:01:16.540
We list the primes on the
left, and the composites

00:01:16.540 --> 00:01:17.890
on the right.

00:01:17.890 --> 00:01:20.530
At first they seem to
dance back and forth.

00:01:20.530 --> 00:01:22.960
There is no obvious
pattern here.

00:01:22.960 --> 00:01:25.950
So let's use a modern technique
to see the big picture.

00:01:25.950 --> 00:01:29.070
The trick is to
use a Ulam spiral.

00:01:29.070 --> 00:01:32.130
First we list all
possible numbers in order

00:01:32.130 --> 00:01:34.160
in a growing spiral.

00:01:34.160 --> 00:01:37.220
Then we color all the
prime numbers blue.

00:01:37.220 --> 00:01:41.420
Finally, we zoom out to
see millions of numbers.

00:01:41.420 --> 00:01:45.340
This is the pattern of primes,
which goes on and on forever.

00:01:45.340 --> 00:01:48.100
Incredibly, the entire
structure of this pattern

00:01:48.100 --> 00:01:50.330
is still unsolved today.

00:01:50.330 --> 00:01:52.080
We are on to something.

00:01:52.080 --> 00:01:55.790
So let's fast forward to around
300 BC in ancient Greece.

00:01:55.790 --> 00:01:58.240
A philosopher known as
Euclid of Alexandria

00:01:58.240 --> 00:01:59.760
understood that
all numbers could

00:01:59.760 --> 00:02:02.860
be split into these two
distinct categories.

00:02:02.860 --> 00:02:06.330
He began by realizing that
any number can be divided down

00:02:06.330 --> 00:02:09.310
over and over until you
reach a group of smallest

00:02:09.310 --> 00:02:10.770
equal numbers.

00:02:10.770 --> 00:02:13.020
And by definition,
these smallest numbers

00:02:13.020 --> 00:02:15.780
are always prime numbers.

00:02:15.780 --> 00:02:17.670
So he knew that all
numbers are somehow

00:02:17.670 --> 00:02:20.660
built out of smaller primes.

00:02:20.660 --> 00:02:23.440
To be clear, imagine the
universe of all numbers,

00:02:23.440 --> 00:02:25.730
and ignore the primes.

00:02:25.730 --> 00:02:30.620
Now, pick any composite
number and break it down,

00:02:30.620 --> 00:02:33.447
and you are always left
with prime numbers.

00:02:33.447 --> 00:02:35.030
So Euclid knew that
every number could

00:02:35.030 --> 00:02:37.810
be expressed using a
group of smaller primes.

00:02:37.810 --> 00:02:40.120
Think of these as
building blocks.

00:02:40.120 --> 00:02:42.220
No matter what
number you choose,

00:02:42.220 --> 00:02:46.270
it can always be built with
an addition of smaller primes.

00:02:46.270 --> 00:02:48.110
This is the root
of his discovery,

00:02:48.110 --> 00:02:52.060
known as the fundamental theorem
of arithmetic, as follows.

00:02:52.060 --> 00:02:55.420
Take any number, say 30, and
find all the prime numbers

00:02:55.420 --> 00:02:57.350
it divides into equally.

00:02:57.350 --> 00:02:59.930
This we know as factorization.

00:02:59.930 --> 00:03:01.610
This will give us
the prime factors.

00:03:01.610 --> 00:03:05.982
In this case, 2, 3, and 5
are the prime factors of 30.

00:03:05.982 --> 00:03:07.440
Euclid realized
that you could then

00:03:07.440 --> 00:03:10.080
multiply these prime
factors a specific number

00:03:10.080 --> 00:03:12.850
of times to build
the original number.

00:03:12.850 --> 00:03:15.400
In this case, you simply
multiply each factor once

00:03:15.400 --> 00:03:16.260
to build 30.

00:03:16.260 --> 00:03:20.290
2 times 3 times 5 is the
prime factorization of 30.

00:03:20.290 --> 00:03:23.260
Think of it as a special
key, or combination.

00:03:23.260 --> 00:03:25.090
There is no other
way to build 30

00:03:25.090 --> 00:03:28.980
using some other groups of prime
numbers multiplied together.

00:03:28.980 --> 00:03:32.600
So every possible number
has one, and only one

00:03:32.600 --> 00:03:34.140
prime factorization.

00:03:34.140 --> 00:03:36.430
A good analogy is to
imagine each number

00:03:36.430 --> 00:03:38.140
as a different lock.

00:03:38.140 --> 00:03:40.050
The unique key for
each lock would

00:03:40.050 --> 00:03:42.080
be its prime factorization.

00:03:42.080 --> 00:03:44.120
No two locks share a key.

00:03:44.120 --> 00:03:47.576
No two numbers share
a prime factorization.
