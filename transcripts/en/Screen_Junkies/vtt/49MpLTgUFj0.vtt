00:00:08.540 --> 00:00:11.340
After Joel Schumacher made Batman silly-

00:00:12.400 --> 00:00:13.840
"Never leave the cave without it."

00:00:14.200 --> 00:00:16.840
-but before Zack Snyder made him a joke.

00:00:16.840 --> 00:00:18.420
"WHY DID YOU SAY THAT NAME?!"

00:00:18.880 --> 00:00:23.040
Chris Nolan made a movie that got the Dark Knight - just - right.

00:00:23.340 --> 00:00:24.320
"WHERE ARE YOU?!"

00:00:24.780 --> 00:00:25.340
"Here."

00:00:25.840 --> 00:00:27.740
Batman Begins

00:00:28.940 --> 00:00:33.080
See one of the best, yet oddly not that successful, Batman films that was so good

00:00:33.080 --> 00:00:37.120
It allowed Christopher Nolan to do whatever he wanted afterwards.

00:00:37.740 --> 00:00:39.400
Except distance himself from the franchise.

00:00:40.320 --> 00:00:45.880
In this perfectly told superhero origin story, back when we weren't sick of superhero origin stories

00:00:46.220 --> 00:00:50.080
that realistically explains how a boy became a crime-fighting bat-ninja.

00:00:50.440 --> 00:00:53.580
Instead of a trust fund kid with a deep-seated fear of wells.

00:00:53.800 --> 00:00:54.440
"Bruce?"

00:00:55.180 --> 00:00:58.780
I mean, had to be even odds he'd become Well Man, right?

00:00:58.820 --> 00:01:03.220
Experience a feature length attempt to ground Batman in reality, where the Batmobile

00:01:03.220 --> 00:01:06.860
was just a bridge-building rocket car WayneTech had laying around,

00:01:07.100 --> 00:01:10.600
the Batcave was simply part of New York's Underground Railroad?

00:01:10.600 --> 00:01:13.720
"Your great-great-grandfather was involved in the underground railroad."

00:01:13.720 --> 00:01:17.560
and the Batshoes that summon a giant cloud of angry bats are-

00:01:17.560 --> 00:01:18.060
uhm

00:01:18.720 --> 00:01:19.360
total BS.

00:01:19.360 --> 00:01:21.480
But who cares? How cool is this!

00:01:23.360 --> 00:01:27.080
Follow along on every step of Bruce Wayne's heroic journey

00:01:27.080 --> 00:01:31.780
from cosplaying as a hobo, to stealing food, to blowing up a school.

00:01:33.300 --> 00:01:38.280
And witness his brutal training at the hands of the Liam of Neesons, I mean, the League of Shadows.

00:01:38.280 --> 00:01:45.880
A group with the sinister plan to stop crime by using a microwave gun to vaporize their special fear juice to kick off the Purge.

00:01:45.880 --> 00:01:47.880
*Unintelligible*

00:01:48.240 --> 00:01:53.900
Wait, what? I thought this was supposed to be the realistic one. That sounds like something Adam West would go up against.

00:01:54.220 --> 00:02:01.100
"It's a sad pill! *laughs* To neutralize the laughing gas! *laughs*"

00:02:01.100 --> 00:02:04.520
But the League of Shadows aren't the only criminals plaguing Gotham.

00:02:04.860 --> 00:02:09.040
There's also Batman, who, if you think about it, is a violent criminal

00:02:09.200 --> 00:02:12.240
who answers to no one, waging a one-man war on the law itself.

00:02:16.320 --> 00:02:17.600
"What do you want?"

00:02:18.620 --> 00:02:20.700
"Too much- *unintelligible*"

00:02:22.400 --> 00:02:23.360
"I'm Batman."

00:02:24.780 --> 00:02:26.680
"AAAHHHHH!"

00:02:35.500 --> 00:02:38.620
"I won't kill you, but I don't have to save you."

00:02:38.620 --> 00:02:42.000
Sorry, still counts as murder if you make a train do it.

00:02:43.340 --> 00:02:47.100
Joining this loner on his one-man quest for justice are:

00:02:47.960 --> 00:02:49.400
a lot of other people.

00:02:49.400 --> 00:02:56.080
Like Alfred, a butler so loyal, he'll drag Batman's sedated girlfriend into the back of a car, no questions asked.

00:02:56.080 --> 00:02:58.520
"Little bit worse for wear I'm afraid."

00:02:58.520 --> 00:03:03.200
Lucius Fox, a man who might be helping Bruce to be a better serial killer for all he knows.

00:03:03.200 --> 00:03:08.200
"Reason you don't have to tell me exactly what you're doing, when I'm asked, I don't have to lie."

00:03:08.800 --> 00:03:13.680
Jim Gordon, a cop with the morals, glasses, and mustache of Ned Flanders.

00:03:13.680 --> 00:03:18.900
Rachel Dawes, a childhood friend with a mysterious past of drinking condensed milk?

00:03:18.900 --> 00:03:21.820
"Alfred still keeps the condensed milk on the top shelf."

00:03:21.820 --> 00:03:22.320
And...

00:03:22.320 --> 00:03:24.380
Holy sh*t is that King Joffrey?!

00:03:24.380 --> 00:03:29.140
That is him! Why are you giving him military hardware?! Take him out before it's too late!

00:03:29.140 --> 00:03:33.680
So strap in with the movie that saved Batman from puns and irrelevance.

00:03:33.680 --> 00:03:36.220
'LetÂ´s kick some ice'

00:03:36.940 --> 00:03:43.800
With the right mix of gritty realism and comic book theatricality, that's a perfectly focused, character-driven story.

00:03:43.800 --> 00:03:45.300
Except for the whole third act.

00:03:45.300 --> 00:03:50.480
"If they get their machine into Wayne Station it'll cause a chain reaction that'll vaporize the entire city's water supply."

00:03:50.480 --> 00:03:54.580
And the fact that half the dialogue is cutesy repetitions of something someone said earlier.

00:03:54.580 --> 00:04:00.740
"It's a bit technical but the key/important thing is that my company's future is secure." X2

00:04:00.800 --> 00:04:06.160
"It's not who you are underneath, it's what you do that defines you." X2

00:04:06.240 --> 00:04:08.580
"Never did learn to *unintelligible*" X2

00:04:08.580 --> 00:04:10.340
"Didn't you get the memo?"

00:04:10.460 --> 00:04:11.020
Shut up!

00:04:11.240 --> 00:04:12.200
"You shut up!"

00:04:12.500 --> 00:04:14.900
Ach! No wonder this movie's so good!

00:04:14.900 --> 00:04:17.180
They only had to write half a script.

00:04:41.660 --> 00:04:46.400
"The League of Shadows has been a check against human corruption for thousands of years.

00:04:46.520 --> 00:04:51.500
We sacked Rome, loaded trade ships with plague-rats, burned London to the ground."

00:04:51.660 --> 00:04:56.960
Canceled Firefly, made Crash win best picture, discovered Justin Bieber, made Harambe a meme.

00:04:57.380 --> 00:05:02.880
It's time to embarrass the Dark Knight, worse than Joel Schumacher did.

00:05:03.760 --> 00:05:12.040
"Batman, you're a cunning strategist and a master of theatricality, but I found your one hidden weakness: getting the sh*t beaten out of you."

00:05:12.120 --> 00:05:14.820
*audience laughs*

00:05:19.100 --> 00:05:20.960
"GO AWAY!"

00:05:22.920 --> 00:05:31.160
Holy scorched earth! If you'd like to watch the roast of Batman, click the box on the left to see the caped crusader's greatest foes get a rise out of the Dark Knight.
