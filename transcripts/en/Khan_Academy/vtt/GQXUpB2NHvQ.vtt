00:00:00.970 --> 00:00:04.030
So I've drawn a circle
here with radius r.

00:00:04.030 --> 00:00:07.940
And its center is at
the point, h comma k.

00:00:07.940 --> 00:00:13.900
So its x-coordinate is
h, and its y-coordinate

00:00:13.900 --> 00:00:16.200
is k right over here.

00:00:16.200 --> 00:00:20.610
What I want to do is figure
out a general formula

00:00:20.610 --> 00:00:23.555
for the equation of this circle.

00:00:23.555 --> 00:00:24.930
In order to do
that, we just have

00:00:24.930 --> 00:00:27.550
to remind ourselves that
a circle, all the points

00:00:27.550 --> 00:00:30.410
on the circle, are the
ones that are exactly

00:00:30.410 --> 00:00:32.619
the radius away from the center.

00:00:32.619 --> 00:00:37.086
Their distance from the center
is exactly going to be r.

00:00:37.086 --> 00:00:38.710
So let's think about
this a little bit.

00:00:38.710 --> 00:00:42.720
What constraints do we have to
put on our x's and y's for them

00:00:42.720 --> 00:00:47.180
to be exactly r away
from the center?

00:00:47.180 --> 00:00:51.940
So let's say that this right
over here is one of the points,

00:00:51.940 --> 00:00:54.190
so this is x comma y.

00:00:54.190 --> 00:00:57.070
And this is one of the
points that is r away,

00:00:57.070 --> 00:00:59.830
exactly r away from the center.

00:00:59.830 --> 00:01:01.620
So what's a
relationship going to be

00:01:01.620 --> 00:01:04.661
between x, y; h, k; and r?

00:01:04.661 --> 00:01:07.160
And I could have put this point
x, y anywhere on the circle.

00:01:07.160 --> 00:01:08.618
I could have done
it here, as well.

00:01:08.618 --> 00:01:09.750
This would also be r away.

00:01:09.750 --> 00:01:14.182
This is also going to be
r away from the center.

00:01:14.182 --> 00:01:16.140
Well, it might not jump
out at you immediately,

00:01:16.140 --> 00:01:19.200
but we can actually use
the Pythagorean Theorem.

00:01:19.200 --> 00:01:22.970
All we need to do, let's draw
one going from the center.

00:01:22.970 --> 00:01:26.910
Let's draw one segment that
is parallel to the x-axis,

00:01:26.910 --> 00:01:28.310
going like this.

00:01:28.310 --> 00:01:30.520
And let's draw another
segment starting at x, y,

00:01:30.520 --> 00:01:34.530
that is parallel to the y-axis,
that's completely vertical.

00:01:34.530 --> 00:01:36.800
So this one is
completely vertical.

00:01:36.800 --> 00:01:38.650
This one is
completely horizontal.

00:01:38.650 --> 00:01:42.690
So this is going to be a
right angle right over here.

00:01:42.690 --> 00:01:44.490
So if we can figure
out the-- if we

00:01:44.490 --> 00:01:49.370
can express the height of this
line in terms of the variables

00:01:49.370 --> 00:01:51.310
we've just put out,
and if we can express

00:01:51.310 --> 00:01:53.640
the height or the width
of this line right

00:01:53.640 --> 00:01:55.780
over here in terms of
these variables somehow,

00:01:55.780 --> 00:01:58.360
then we can relate
those between that

00:01:58.360 --> 00:02:00.780
and r using the
Pythagorean Theorem. r

00:02:00.780 --> 00:02:03.690
is the hypotenuse of
this right triangle.

00:02:03.690 --> 00:02:06.190
Well, what's this
height going to be?

00:02:06.190 --> 00:02:08.570
Well, we know this
point right over here

00:02:08.570 --> 00:02:10.619
has a y-coordinate of k.

00:02:10.619 --> 00:02:12.160
This point over
here, well, that just

00:02:12.160 --> 00:02:14.500
has a y-coordinate, I
guess we could just say,

00:02:14.500 --> 00:02:17.440
that has a y-coordinate of y.

00:02:17.440 --> 00:02:21.190
So this distance
right over here is

00:02:21.190 --> 00:02:24.060
going to be the same exact
thing as this distance

00:02:24.060 --> 00:02:25.200
right over here.

00:02:25.200 --> 00:02:27.420
So it's going to be y minus k.

00:02:33.310 --> 00:02:35.060
And what's this
distance going to be?

00:02:35.060 --> 00:02:36.310
Well, same exact argument.

00:02:36.310 --> 00:02:37.630
This is h.

00:02:37.630 --> 00:02:40.590
And this point right over
here, if we go all the way,

00:02:40.590 --> 00:02:44.890
or this point on the x-axis,
well, we'll just call that x.

00:02:44.890 --> 00:02:47.750
So what's this distance
right over here?

00:02:47.750 --> 00:02:53.452
Well, this distance is
going to be x minus h.

00:02:57.610 --> 00:03:01.380
So what is the relationship
between this side of length x

00:03:01.380 --> 00:03:04.280
minus h, this side of
length y minus k, and r?

00:03:04.280 --> 00:03:06.210
Well, it's the
Pythagorean Theorem.

00:03:06.210 --> 00:03:08.250
The sum of the squares
of the two shorter sides

00:03:08.250 --> 00:03:10.880
is going to be equal to the
square of the hypotenuse.

00:03:10.880 --> 00:03:14.180
So one of the shorter
sides has length this,

00:03:14.180 --> 00:03:15.630
has length x minus h.

00:03:15.630 --> 00:03:17.410
So I could write x minus h.

00:03:17.410 --> 00:03:20.710
So the length of
that side squared

00:03:20.710 --> 00:03:24.920
plus the length of this side--
let me do this in a color

00:03:24.920 --> 00:03:28.400
that I haven't used yet--
plus the length of this side

00:03:28.400 --> 00:03:33.460
squared, so plus
y minus k squared

00:03:33.460 --> 00:03:36.170
is going to be equal to
the hypotenuse squared,

00:03:36.170 --> 00:03:39.780
is going to be equal
to the radius squared.

00:03:39.780 --> 00:03:44.250
And just like that, we have
found the general equation

00:03:44.250 --> 00:03:51.290
of a circle, where h comma k
is the center of the circle

00:03:51.290 --> 00:03:53.060
and r is the radius.

00:03:53.060 --> 00:03:58.220
Any combination of x's and y's
that meet this, that for which

00:03:58.220 --> 00:04:01.180
this is true given your
center, given h and k

00:04:01.180 --> 00:04:07.450
and given the radius,
then any x's and y's that

00:04:07.450 --> 00:04:11.210
will meet these constraints
are going to be on the circle.

00:04:11.210 --> 00:04:13.780
So another way you could think
about it, if someone said,

00:04:13.780 --> 00:04:17.399
hey, look I have
a center-- let me

00:04:17.399 --> 00:04:22.164
write it this way-- the center
of my circle is at the point,

00:04:22.164 --> 00:04:25.920
I don't know, 5, negative 5.

00:04:25.920 --> 00:04:32.200
And if they said that
the radius is equal to 4,

00:04:32.200 --> 00:04:34.930
then, we could immediately say
what the equation of the circle

00:04:34.930 --> 00:04:35.990
is going to be.

00:04:35.990 --> 00:04:39.460
It's going to be x minus
this right over here-- let me

00:04:39.460 --> 00:04:45.006
color code this a little bit--
this right over here is our h.

00:04:45.006 --> 00:04:48.380
This right over here is our k.

00:04:48.380 --> 00:04:50.240
And this is our radius.

00:04:50.240 --> 00:04:52.530
This right over
here is our radius.

00:04:52.530 --> 00:04:57.160
So the equation of the
circle would be x minus h,

00:04:57.160 --> 00:05:10.030
so x minus 5 squared plus
y minus k. k is negative 5.

00:05:10.030 --> 00:05:12.670
So if you subtract
negative 5, that

00:05:12.670 --> 00:05:15.770
would be the same thing
as adding positive 5.

00:05:15.770 --> 00:05:20.970
So y plus 5 squared
is equal to r squared.

00:05:20.970 --> 00:05:25.690
Well, r in the example I
just made up is equal to 16.

00:05:25.690 --> 00:05:28.140
So someone told you that the
center is at 5, negative 5,

00:05:28.140 --> 00:05:29.786
the radius is
four, well, this is

00:05:29.786 --> 00:05:31.410
going to be the
equation of the circle.

00:05:31.410 --> 00:05:33.530
On the other hand,
if someone gave you

00:05:33.530 --> 00:05:35.860
this as the equation
of the circle,

00:05:35.860 --> 00:05:38.100
you know that the
center is going

00:05:38.100 --> 00:05:44.390
to be, well, it's going
to be at x equals 5.

00:05:44.390 --> 00:05:47.280
And y equals, and
since this is a plus,

00:05:47.280 --> 00:05:51.310
you know that this is going
to have to be, they're k.

00:05:51.310 --> 00:05:54.690
The center is going to
be at 5, negative 5.

00:05:54.690 --> 00:05:56.120
Another way to
think about is what

00:05:56.120 --> 00:05:59.410
are the x and y's that will
make each of these terms

00:05:59.410 --> 00:06:00.200
equal to zero?

00:06:00.200 --> 00:06:02.890
So if you have x equals
5 here, then this thing's

00:06:02.890 --> 00:06:04.100
going to be equal to 0.

00:06:04.100 --> 00:06:06.500
If you have y equals
negative 5, then

00:06:06.500 --> 00:06:09.370
this thing is going
to be equal to 0.

00:06:09.370 --> 00:06:12.824
If you had a circle centered
at the origin at zero,

00:06:12.824 --> 00:06:15.490
then you're just going to have x
squared plus y squared is going

00:06:15.490 --> 00:06:17.543
to be equal to the
radius squared.
