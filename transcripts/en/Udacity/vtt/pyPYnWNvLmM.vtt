00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.000
Given the division of labor in the solver as discussed before,

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:08.000
which component would be affected by each of these actions?

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:11.000
To use an implicit method? To stop at time 42?

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:15.000
To determine the value at time 13.000?

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:17.000
And to set a different value for the mass?

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:19.000
Enter the first letter of that component.

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:22.000
The driver, the stepper, the algorithm, the right-hand side,

00:00:22.000 --> 09:59:59.000
the output, or is it unclear?
