00:00:00.041 --> 00:00:02.104
I have a bunch of shapes here, let's think
about what they are

00:00:03.004 --> 00:00:07.060
so this first shape here, you probably
recognize it is the shape of the moon in

00:00:07.006 --> 00:00:07.506
the sky

00:00:08.038 --> 00:00:11.040
or atleast on a full moon and we call it

00:00:11.058 --> 00:00:14.077
a circle. Now

00:00:14.599 --> 00:00:17.667
what makes it a circle when you get
further in math we come up with fancier

00:00:18.279 --> 00:00:21.590
ways to define a circle but one with
think about it is if we take the center

00:00:21.059 --> 00:00:21.559
the circle

00:00:22.004 --> 00:00:25.061
and if we go from one side
of the circle to the other side circle

00:00:25.097 --> 00:00:26.146
through the center

00:00:27.019 --> 00:00:30.760
that's always going to be the same
length so that's the same length

00:00:30.076 --> 00:00:35.077
as is this as this is on his way to the
center the circle

00:00:35.086 --> 00:00:38.101
as that now

00:00:39.001 --> 00:00:42.002
if that the circle what would something
like this to be

00:00:42.011 --> 00:00:45.190
what you might call this an oval.

00:00:45.289 --> 00:00:49.440
all circles are ovals but this
oval is not a circle because if you have

00:00:49.044 --> 00:00:50.051
its center

00:00:50.051 --> 00:00:54.068
see right over there this distance going
in that direction

00:00:54.068 --> 00:00:57.069
is going to be much shorter or just
shorter

00:00:57.078 --> 00:01:01.085
than this distance right over here so
this one right over here

00:01:01.085 --> 00:01:06.092
is not a circle, this one is. Now what
about the shape over here that has three

00:01:06.092 --> 00:01:06.592
sides

00:01:07.063 --> 00:01:10.372
one two three

00:01:10.939 --> 00:01:14.430
you could also say it has three corners
one two

00:01:14.043 --> 00:01:18.082
three if you have three sides we call that a
triangle

00:01:18.082 --> 00:01:23.154
Tri angle whenever you see this Tri over
hear that's a good

00:01:24.054 --> 00:01:27.111
sign that you're dealing with the number
three. This is a triangle

00:01:28.011 --> 00:01:31.078
has three sides note about these shapes
over here

00:01:31.078 --> 00:01:34.597
these shapes are interesting how many
shapes. So how many sides

00:01:35.299 --> 00:01:38.345
do these shapes have. Well if you count them

00:01:38.759 --> 00:01:42.560
you see that this one up here in purple

00:01:42.056 --> 00:01:45.795
has one two three four sides

00:01:46.299 --> 00:01:49.670
this one has one two three

00:01:49.067 --> 00:01:52.196
four sides, this has one two

00:01:52.799 --> 00:01:56.490
three four sides, this has one

00:01:56.049 --> 00:02:00.084
two three four sides. So they all have four sides.

00:02:00.084 --> 00:02:04.573
So a name for any shape that has four
sides is quadrilateral

00:02:05.329 --> 00:02:06.368
Quad

00:02:06.719 --> 00:02:09.768
dri quadrilateral

00:02:10.209 --> 00:02:15.280
quadrilateral and when you see this quad
at the beginning of the word

00:02:15.028 --> 00:02:18.087
it's a pretty good sign that you're
dealing with the number four

00:02:18.087 --> 00:02:21.706
four sides, four sides

00:02:22.489 --> 00:02:26.110
that's what quadrilateral means but
these are all different special cases of

00:02:26.011 --> 00:02:27.019
quadrilaterals

00:02:27.019 --> 00:02:31.026
and actually you could even have a quadrilateral that
looks like this, could even have a

00:02:31.026 --> 00:02:32.108
quadrilateral that look like this. One

00:02:33.008 --> 00:02:37.777
two three four sides as long as as four sides
it's a quadrilateral

00:02:37.849 --> 00:02:41.940
Let's think about each of these so this
shape right over here

00:02:41.094 --> 00:02:44.122
what you might see is the corners the
corners

00:02:45.022 --> 00:02:48.089
all come in, sometimes is called square
sometimes

00:02:48.089 --> 00:02:51.116
you could call it a right angle so

00:02:52.016 --> 00:02:57.115
and notice I could put little small squares
here. SO if all four corners are square

00:02:58.015 --> 00:03:01.022
or they're all come in at a right angle

00:03:01.022 --> 00:03:04.131
like this then you're dealing with a
rectangle

00:03:04.329 --> 00:03:08.910
you are dealing with the rectangle and so
just to be clear

00:03:08.091 --> 00:03:12.095
this down here is not a rectangle notice
this corner right over if I tried to

00:03:13.031 --> 00:03:14.460
pull all square here

00:03:14.739 --> 00:03:17.790
it would either look like this or
doesn't

00:03:17.079 --> 00:03:20.080
it doesn't the two sides aren't two
sides of a square

00:03:20.089 --> 00:03:23.278
or would look like or it would look like
this

00:03:24.079 --> 00:03:27.650
so this is not a square corner neither
it is this

00:03:27.065 --> 00:03:30.159
or neither is this so this is not a
rectangle

00:03:31.059 --> 00:03:35.548
all four corners need to be square this
one also is not a rectangle

00:03:36.079 --> 00:03:39.620
notice the corners are not

00:03:39.062 --> 00:03:43.081
the corners are not right angles so

00:03:43.081 --> 00:03:46.138
this is a direct rectangle this is a
direct rectangle and what about this

00:03:47.038 --> 00:03:51.081
well I can do that I can put little
squares

00:03:51.081 --> 00:03:54.104
I could put all squares in the corner or

00:03:55.004 --> 00:03:58.020
I could see that they are all right all
the corners

00:03:58.002 --> 00:04:01.011
are right angles so this actually is a
rectangle as well

00:04:02.001 --> 00:04:06.040
so these are both these are both
rectangles

00:04:06.139 --> 00:04:10.000
now you might recognize this purple one
on the left is a special type a

00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:10.078
rectangle

00:04:10.078 --> 00:04:13.078
not only are all the corners square

00:04:13.078 --> 00:04:14.107
not all do they have

00:04:15.007 --> 00:04:18.050
these right angles but all the sides are
the same length

00:04:18.005 --> 00:04:21.005
at least it looks like it from the
picture this side is the same length as this

00:04:21.051 --> 00:04:22.115
side is the same length as that side

00:04:23.015 --> 00:04:27.093
same length as that side. So if the sides are
of same length and all the corners are

00:04:27.093 --> 00:04:31.096
square where they have right angles,
then we call it a square

00:04:31.096 --> 00:04:34.134
so this right over here is a, this

00:04:35.034 --> 00:04:38.112
right over here is a square special type
a rectangle

00:04:39.012 --> 00:04:42.096
this one not all the side to the same
this one all the sides are the same

00:04:42.096 --> 00:04:46.122
out if we go down here looks like all
the sides are the same one

00:04:47.022 --> 00:04:51.031
two three four

00:04:51.031 --> 00:04:54.069
but it doesn't have

00:04:54.069 --> 00:04:57.161
square corners. Notice if I tried to put
a little square here

00:04:58.061 --> 00:05:02.074
it wouldn't fit perfectly, if I tried
square here doesn't fit perfectly these

00:05:02.074 --> 00:05:03.091
aren't right angles

00:05:03.091 --> 00:05:06.132
So if all four sides are the same and
that's all we know about it

00:05:07.032 --> 00:05:11.124
we call it a rhombus. We call it a
rhombus

00:05:12.024 --> 00:05:16.028
so you might be saying, the square all
four sides are the same, is that a rhombus?

00:05:16.028 --> 00:05:19.075
yes it is. So the square is a rectangle

00:05:19.075 --> 00:05:22.133
it's a rectangle and

00:05:23.033 --> 00:05:29.088
is a rhombus so this last shape here
this last quadrilateral

00:05:29.088 --> 00:05:32.093
what's interesting about it is you have

00:05:32.093 --> 00:05:35.108
two of the side's going in the same
direction

00:05:36.008 --> 00:05:39.043
so this one right over here knows what I
mean by the same direction it sometimes

00:05:39.043 --> 00:05:40.075
is called parallel

00:05:40.075 --> 00:05:44.157
if I draw two lines here these two lines
are never going to cross each other

00:05:45.057 --> 00:05:49.111
so these two lines are parallel if you
have opposite one pair of opposite sides

00:05:50.011 --> 00:05:50.511
that are parallel

00:05:51.004 --> 00:05:56.053
we call them trapezoids we call them
trapezoids.

00:05:56.053 --> 00:05:59.096
Notice the other blinds the other
opposite sides

00:05:59.096 --> 00:06:02.100
these will cross, these will cross

00:06:03.036 --> 00:06:06.119
eventually to that right over there is
called a trapezoid.
