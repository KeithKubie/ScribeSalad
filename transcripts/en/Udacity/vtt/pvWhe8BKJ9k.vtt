00:00:00.330 --> 00:00:03.390
Hi, my name is Franklin Kalk. I'm 60 years old. I live in

00:00:03.390 --> 00:00:09.790
Austin, Texas. I took Warfarin for six months, about three years ago. I

00:00:09.790 --> 00:00:15.100
had a blood clot probably due to heavy travel. There were no other

00:00:15.100 --> 00:00:19.310
complicating symptoms or at least that was what we surmised at the time.

00:00:19.310 --> 00:00:22.560
&gt;&gt; Now when you say you had a blood clot that, you know,

00:00:22.560 --> 00:00:25.600
to anyone who hasn't had a blood clot before that sounds kind of serious.

00:00:25.600 --> 00:00:26.460
Is that serious?

00:00:26.460 --> 00:00:31.401
&gt;&gt; It is, and it was kind of an interesting I mean I'll tell you the long

00:00:31.401 --> 00:00:38.952
version, right? it started out, I in retrospect, probably for several months,

00:00:38.952 --> 00:00:39.483
&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.

00:00:39.483 --> 00:00:43.555
&gt;&gt; I had some developing issues, but didn't really know it at the time.

00:00:43.555 --> 00:00:44.238
&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.

00:00:44.238 --> 00:00:47.764
&gt;&gt; But looking back after, after I discovered it

00:00:47.764 --> 00:00:50.880
it became pretty clear that I had, you know,

00:00:50.880 --> 00:00:54.191
had had these these symptoms. You know, I didn't

00:00:54.191 --> 00:00:56.369
really know anything about blood clots. I have to

00:00:56.369 --> 00:00:58.610
say, I wasn't educated about them at all. I,

00:00:58.610 --> 00:01:01.040
I'm a little better educated now, of course, but at

00:01:01.040 --> 00:01:06.170
the time, I really didn't know anything. once the pain moved

00:01:06.170 --> 00:01:11.510
from my calf to my groin, I kind of, you know, figured out. Oh, wait

00:01:11.510 --> 00:01:16.790
a minute, this isn't just a muscle pull, and it's really tender.

00:01:16.790 --> 00:01:21.500
I mean you, I couldn't touch it without it being pretty painful, so

00:01:21.500 --> 00:01:24.940
That was a little bit. You know, muscle pulls don't really feel that way.

00:01:24.940 --> 00:01:28.340
With muscle pull, if you, you know, if you really massage, maybe okay. But

00:01:28.340 --> 00:01:32.500
I mean, just, light touch, I could feel it. So it was something different.

00:01:32.500 --> 00:01:34.221
&gt;&gt; Well, after you have the

00:01:34.221 --> 00:01:34.320
[INAUDIBLE]

00:01:34.320 --> 00:01:36.850
and you were able to sort of bust up the initial clot.

00:01:36.850 --> 00:01:37.458
&gt;&gt; Right.

00:01:37.458 --> 00:01:41.810
&gt;&gt; The warfarin was prescribed to, essentially, prevent clots

00:01:41.810 --> 00:01:44.490
from forming for a period of time in the future.

00:01:44.490 --> 00:01:44.595
&gt;&gt; Right.

00:01:44.595 --> 00:01:46.860
&gt;&gt; Now, is this a pill that you had to

00:01:46.860 --> 00:01:48.320
take every day? Well, first off, is it a pill?

00:01:48.320 --> 00:01:48.730
&gt;&gt; It's a pill.

00:01:48.730 --> 00:01:50.290
&gt;&gt; And is it something you had to take every day?

00:01:50.290 --> 00:01:55.400
&gt;&gt; Right, it's a pill. You take it every day. and I'm

00:01:55.400 --> 00:01:59.500
trying to remem-, I can't remember exactly whether I actually took more

00:01:59.500 --> 00:02:02.050
than one in a day to ramp up to

00:02:02.050 --> 00:02:05.666
some level or not. I don't remember, but. It took

00:02:05.666 --> 00:02:08.554
about two weeks to determine that I was stable

00:02:08.554 --> 00:02:11.442
on it, that my, my clotting factors were at a

00:02:11.442 --> 00:02:14.634
normal level and not varying a lot' cause that's

00:02:14.634 --> 00:02:18.190
one of the things they look for. so I had

00:02:18.190 --> 00:02:21.800
to get you know, blood tests every, every twice a

00:02:21.800 --> 00:02:24.580
week for two weeks and then every week after that.

00:02:24.580 --> 00:02:28.340
But it's a pill and you know long term over six months I took it once a day.

00:02:28.340 --> 00:02:30.620
&gt;&gt; And so obviously, I guess, the concern

00:02:30.620 --> 00:02:34.480
is since the warfarin itself modulates the clotting factors,

00:02:34.480 --> 00:02:38.000
and how effective and efficient they work for you,

00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:40.710
that too much warfarin could be a bad thing.

00:02:40.710 --> 00:02:41.740
&gt;&gt; Absolutely, yeah.

00:02:41.740 --> 00:02:43.510
&gt;&gt; So, when your doctor prescribed this for

00:02:43.510 --> 00:02:46.380
you, what were the considerations that went into I

00:02:46.380 --> 00:02:49.610
mean, did he have lots of special instructions for you, did he try to get a lot

00:02:49.610 --> 00:02:52.480
of information from you, did you have to modify anything in your life

00:02:52.480 --> 00:02:53.030
&gt;&gt; Right.

00:02:53.030 --> 00:02:54.180
&gt;&gt; To accommodate the dosing?

00:02:54.180 --> 00:02:59.620
&gt;&gt; yes, all of the above. He gave me some fairly, they weren't super

00:02:59.620 --> 00:03:03.660
detailed, but fairly detailed instructions. I, you

00:03:03.660 --> 00:03:06.632
know once I discovered and had verified it.

00:03:06.632 --> 00:03:06.740
[LAUGH]

00:03:06.740 --> 00:03:09.460
The doctor, that I had a clot. And that I was,

00:03:09.460 --> 00:03:12.910
you know? because these shots will remind you, if nothing else. because

00:03:12.910 --> 00:03:16.000
compared to the shots, or warfarin itself, was not really a

00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:18.720
big deal for me in terms of the, you know, the ingestion.

00:03:18.720 --> 00:03:19.020
&gt;&gt; Sure.

00:03:19.020 --> 00:03:22.370
&gt;&gt; More or less, cursorily went over the instructions with me,

00:03:22.370 --> 00:03:24.720
rather than go through them word by word. Because he know

00:03:24.720 --> 00:03:28.180
I had read them, and had begun to educate myself, and

00:03:28.180 --> 00:03:31.740
I was lucky because my personal physician was also my next

00:03:31.740 --> 00:03:35.530
store neighbor. So he knew my lifestyle and knew that I was

00:03:35.530 --> 00:03:37.590
going to be, you know, pretty diligent

00:03:37.590 --> 00:03:40.580
about understanding this, you know, this condition.

00:03:40.580 --> 00:03:42.470
&gt;&gt; Mm-hm. What were some of the special

00:03:42.470 --> 00:03:47.960
exceptions we know that vitamin K is really important.

00:03:47.960 --> 00:03:48.080
&gt;&gt; Right.

00:03:48.080 --> 00:03:50.210
&gt;&gt; rather the amounts of vitamin K, it

00:03:50.210 --> 00:03:52.730
was vitamin K as an essential component for clotting.

00:03:52.730 --> 00:03:53.040
&gt;&gt; Right.

00:03:53.040 --> 00:03:56.980
&gt;&gt; So did you have to alter your diet or did you have to pay special

00:03:56.980 --> 00:03:57.650
attention to it?

00:03:57.650 --> 00:04:00.950
&gt;&gt; Yes. So before, and this is another interesting sort

00:04:00.950 --> 00:04:05.000
of predetermining factor, I think. Not just the travel but I

00:04:05.000 --> 00:04:08.890
ate a lot of leafy green vegetables which have, those are

00:04:08.890 --> 00:04:12.080
really the main sources in our normal diet of vitamin K.

00:04:14.130 --> 00:04:16.550
for example iceberg lettuce doesn't have much but

00:04:16.550 --> 00:04:19.940
romaine does, right. Kale has enormous amounts. Spinach, I

00:04:19.940 --> 00:04:27.090
love spinach. I, I ate a lot of spinach before that. So I had to cut back

00:04:27.090 --> 00:04:32.020
and I really, I didn't eliminate them from my diet, but I cut way back. And I

00:04:32.020 --> 00:04:36.460
did control very carefully, the intake. So I, I

00:04:36.460 --> 00:04:39.360
knew exactly how much I was taking each day.

00:04:39.360 --> 00:04:41.370
There were some things I totally eliminated

00:04:41.370 --> 00:04:44.070
from my diet. For example avocados, and

00:04:44.070 --> 00:04:49.070
the reason for that is, avacados you can have two avocados that look the same.

00:04:49.070 --> 00:04:49.785
&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.

00:04:49.785 --> 00:04:52.780
&gt;&gt; But yet one will have very little vitamin K

00:04:52.780 --> 00:04:56.800
and the other one can have enormous amount per unit weight.

00:04:56.800 --> 00:05:02.070
So the, the variability was just is something that you know

00:05:02.070 --> 00:05:04.630
you would, you just imagine, well I'm not going to eat those

00:05:04.630 --> 00:05:06.530
then, right? Because I don't want to inject that kind

00:05:06.530 --> 00:05:09.350
of variability in to my diet. In fact when I

00:05:09.350 --> 00:05:13.390
had the weekly blood test one thing I noticed right

00:05:13.390 --> 00:05:17.450
away was that the bleeding did not stop. Just a little

00:05:17.450 --> 00:05:20.130
pin prick in the finger is, is what was needed

00:05:20.130 --> 00:05:23.570
to get the blood test taken. So, you know, you can

00:05:23.570 --> 00:05:26.600
usually just do this with your fingers for two or

00:05:26.600 --> 00:05:29.880
three minutes and then the blood will stop, right? But it

00:05:29.880 --> 00:05:33.710
would take thirty minutes or more, because we were

00:05:33.710 --> 00:05:37.310
trying to keep my blood relatively thin the other thing,

00:05:37.310 --> 00:05:39.510
the other lifestyle change for me was I like to

00:05:39.510 --> 00:05:43.080
drive cars fast at the racetrack and I couldn't do

00:05:43.080 --> 00:05:45.860
that anymore because of the concern about blunt force trauma.

00:05:45.860 --> 00:05:47.770
Any kind of accident, you know, if you have a

00:05:47.770 --> 00:05:50.730
bad bruise you could, you know, potentially bleed to death

00:05:50.730 --> 00:05:54.760
if your blood doesn't clot well. So, you know, that's,

00:05:54.760 --> 00:05:59.700
that's the kind of thing that you know, really was a big change for me. For me

00:05:59.700 --> 00:06:03.870
personally, I stopped traveling for about six to

00:06:03.870 --> 00:06:07.470
eight weeks and then after that I remember still

00:06:07.470 --> 00:06:10.320
the first aircraft that I got on. I

00:06:10.320 --> 00:06:14.470
was fidgeting, and it was Austin to Dallas, you

00:06:14.470 --> 00:06:17.100
know, literally a 35 minute flight and then

00:06:17.100 --> 00:06:19.950
I went Dallas to Milwaukee. So maybe an hour,

00:06:19.950 --> 00:06:22.180
right? Not very far. I was fidgeting the

00:06:22.180 --> 00:06:24.205
whole time just trying to keep my blood flowing

00:06:24.205 --> 00:06:24.950
[LAUGH].

00:06:24.950 --> 00:06:28.360
I mean it's, it really changes your attitude. I mean,

00:06:28.360 --> 00:06:32.380
for me it was my first, glimpse of mortality, right?

00:06:32.380 --> 00:06:35.240
So I mean that was, that was a big deal.

00:06:35.240 --> 00:06:38.290
And I think also, you know just having to go

00:06:38.290 --> 00:06:40.330
through a dietary change for the first time in my

00:06:40.330 --> 00:06:44.090
life and strictly control my diet You know, my attitude

00:06:44.090 --> 00:06:47.140
had always been, I'll eat as much as I want,

00:06:47.140 --> 00:06:50.490
anything I want, I'll just exercise to, to keep my weight,

00:06:50.490 --> 00:06:53.760
you know, where I want it. It wasn't like that any more.

00:06:53.760 --> 00:06:54.275
&gt;&gt; Uh-huh.

00:06:54.275 --> 00:06:56.760
&gt;&gt; So that was a big change. And, you know, it was

00:06:56.760 --> 00:07:01.800
a big change for my family, because now all of a sudden, if

00:07:01.800 --> 00:07:06.950
we were, if they were going to have Kale or spinach, I wasn't.

00:07:06.950 --> 00:07:10.240
So it was almost like we had to cook for two different diets.

00:07:10.240 --> 00:07:10.624
&gt;&gt; mm.

00:07:10.624 --> 00:07:13.090
&gt;&gt; Right? So I mean and just things like that, I mean

00:07:13.090 --> 00:07:15.540
that was, that was part of it. But I think also there was

00:07:15.540 --> 00:07:20.410
probably some worry, you know, from the other family members about, you know, is

00:07:20.410 --> 00:07:25.620
dad okay or is my husband okay, right? When I read about Warfarin I thought

00:07:25.620 --> 00:07:28.280
Well, you know, a couple of things. It's a lot like aspirin, it was

00:07:28.280 --> 00:07:30.470
discovered quite a while ago, well, early

00:07:30.470 --> 00:07:33.040
in the last century. Maybe 1930's or 20's.

00:07:35.400 --> 00:07:37.490
it's amazing that such an effective drug has

00:07:37.490 --> 00:07:42.320
not really had yet, a replacement that works, kind of

00:07:42.320 --> 00:07:45.420
for everybody. You know what I mean? that was

00:07:45.420 --> 00:07:50.430
interesting to me. because it has been used really

00:07:50.430 --> 00:07:53.570
for other purposes than treating blood clots before

00:07:53.570 --> 00:07:56.430
that. At first I thought I'm not sure I

00:07:56.430 --> 00:07:58.100
want to put this in my body but it really

00:07:58.100 --> 00:08:00.690
wasn't all that bad. The actual ingestion of the,

00:08:00.690 --> 00:08:04.980
of the drug itself. I really felt nothing

00:08:04.980 --> 00:08:08.980
and, you know, I felt perfectly normal. so

00:08:08.980 --> 00:08:14.120
that was good. And I think there you know don't fear, right? On the other hand

00:08:14.120 --> 00:08:16.840
for me I, I stabilized rapidly and, and

00:08:16.840 --> 00:08:19.740
you know my my clotting factor levels stayed

00:08:19.740 --> 00:08:22.200
very constant over time. Maybe that was just

00:08:22.200 --> 00:08:25.720
discipline. So my advice would be, follow a,

00:08:25.720 --> 00:08:28.210
a diet, you know, be really strict about your diet. That

00:08:28.210 --> 00:08:31.700
doesn't mean, you know, deprive yourself but, but be consistent with

00:08:31.700 --> 00:08:35.539
it, so that your, your, your body is being presented with

00:08:35.539 --> 00:08:40.539
the same chemistry from nutrition. I mean, I think that's really important.
