00:00:00.403 --> 00:00:02.684
So as I’ve stated in the problem, some of these are

00:00:02.684 --> 00:00:06.944
subjective, but here is my answer. I believe that the most

00:00:06.944 --> 00:00:11.078
severe threat is if Alice’s onion proxy is compromised.

00:00:11.078 --> 00:00:14.181
if an attacker has access to Alice’s onion proxy,

00:00:14.181 --> 00:00:17.361
if Alice’s onion proxy is compromised, an attacker can learn

00:00:17.361 --> 00:00:21.393
all of Alice’s traffic. The least severe threat is option A.

00:00:21.393 --> 00:00:23.999
If an attacker in the middle intercepts the Relay Extend

00:00:23.999 --> 00:00:26.908
request between onion router 2 and onion router 3,

00:00:26.908 --> 00:00:29.430
in attempts to set up a different Diffie-Hellman key,

00:00:29.430 --> 00:00:31.709
the hash check will detect problem. And so I think

00:00:31.709 --> 00:00:35.049
this is the least threatening between E and F, I think that

00:00:35.049 --> 00:00:38.579
E is more threatening than F having control of the entry

00:00:38.579 --> 00:00:41.492
and exit nodes is more powerful than having control of

00:00:41.492 --> 00:00:43.945
this just the entry and some node in the middle.

00:00:43.945 --> 00:00:47.317
And so now we need to figure out where to put D and B.

00:00:47.317 --> 00:00:49.843
I think that D is a weaker threat than F just being able to

00:00:49.843 --> 00:00:53.455
observe network traffic is not very useful if you cannot

00:00:53.455 --> 00:00:56.296
correlate anything. Having control of two routers will give an

00:00:56.296 --> 00:00:59.057
attacker some ability to correlate traffic perhaps through

00:00:59.057 --> 00:01:03.148
timing attacks. So D is a weaker attack than F. I think that B

00:01:03.148 --> 00:01:06.697
is a more threat than E. If an attacker controls the directory

00:01:06.697 --> 00:01:10.399
server, it could possibly return only nodes under its control.

00:01:10.399 --> 00:01:13.166
Then having control of three nodes is a more serious threat

00:01:13.166 --> 00:01:15.358
than having control only two nodes

00:01:15.358 --> 00:01:19.358
So my answer is C, B, E, F, D and A.
