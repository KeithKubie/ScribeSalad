&gt;&gt;From the Library of
Congress in Washington DC.

00:00:04.510 --> 00:00:05.510
[ Silence ]

00:00:07.040 --> 00:00:07.640
&gt;&gt;Ned Marcelle: My
name is Ned Marcelle.

00:00:09.040 --> 00:00:10.740
I'm the Editor of the Style
section of the Washington Post

00:00:11.140 --> 00:00:15.206
and the Post is proud to be a
charter sponsor of the festival,

00:00:15.700 --> 00:00:19.966
and every year, Maria Arono, who
helps organize the whole affair,

00:00:22.050 --> 00:00:22.440
chooses one of us from
the Post, and a writer,

00:00:24.660 --> 00:00:29.060
and it's like this big yenta of
matchmaking us, and I always figure

00:00:29.080 --> 00:00:32.746
out what's the connection
that she saw, and sure enough,

00:00:32.880 --> 00:00:33.336
in Julia's biography, it's clear
that she's, she spent a lot of time

00:00:36.890 --> 00:00:37.010
in magazines, like
I did in New York,

00:00:39.170 --> 00:00:39.186
and she worked in the
copy department.

00:00:41.620 --> 00:00:41.753
And, as an editor at a magazine,

00:00:43.620 --> 00:00:47.953
I know that the Copy Editor's
respect standards in this unique way

00:00:48.070 --> 00:00:48.396
and perfects sentences for all
these writers who are far-flung

00:00:51.810 --> 00:00:53.810
and put together this package.

00:00:54.280 --> 00:00:55.500
And, they have a sort of interior
life that is always well known

00:00:57.260 --> 00:01:00.526
in the office, but they
don't quite share readily,

00:01:02.390 --> 00:01:04.923
so it makes perfect
sense that in 2002,

00:01:05.360 --> 00:01:09.960
when Julia's Three Junes came out,
it emerged as a fully-formed novel,

00:01:10.830 --> 00:01:13.630
her first, and won the
National Book Award,

00:01:14.170 --> 00:01:14.506
and lead to an amazing literary
career that we're still enjoying,

00:01:18.100 --> 00:01:19.033
and welcoming new readers to
it every year, as this year,

00:01:20.900 --> 00:01:23.300
with her publication
of Widower Tale.

00:01:23.520 --> 00:01:23.996
So, without hesitation, I invite
you to welcome with me Julia Glass.

00:01:27.510 --> 00:01:28.510
[ Clapping ]

00:01:35.170 --> 00:01:35.633
&gt;&gt;Julia Glass: Wow, this, I,
this is my third time coming

00:01:38.440 --> 00:01:38.856
to this festival, and every time
the turnout is bigger and bigger

00:01:42.290 --> 00:01:45.690
and it's so gratifying, and
I'm just going to assume

00:01:46.750 --> 00:01:47.016
that there's no doubt in your mind

00:01:48.750 --> 00:01:51.150
that I might actually
be Ken Follett.

00:01:51.250 --> 00:01:52.250
[Laughter]

00:01:54.780 --> 00:01:56.303
Okay. I also want to say that
it should have been obvious

00:01:56.990 --> 00:02:00.590
to Ken that, to Ned, that
the reason that he was picked

00:02:01.530 --> 00:02:04.530
to introduce me is that
we're both so stylish.

00:02:04.650 --> 00:02:05.650


00:02:06.190 --> 00:02:09.256
Wow, you know, this is
obvious to you I'm sure,

00:02:09.780 --> 00:02:14.180
but we writers are readers too,
and one of the things that's so fun

00:02:15.050 --> 00:02:18.850
about this event is that we
get to meet and listen to some

00:02:19.810 --> 00:02:21.943
of our favorite writers as well.

00:02:22.060 --> 00:02:22.440
I got to listen to Susan Collins
this morning, my son and I are,

00:02:25.880 --> 00:02:26.633
you know, who isn't big fans of the
Hunger Gang series, and this morning

00:02:29.860 --> 00:02:34.126
at breakfast, Rosemary Wells came
up to me and wanted to meet me,

00:02:34.590 --> 00:02:38.856
and I was just like, "Oh my God
the Buddy Planet", and, you know,

00:02:38.980 --> 00:02:39.006
I've read her books so many,
many, many, many times to both

00:02:42.820 --> 00:02:44.953
of my sons when they were small.

00:02:44.990 --> 00:02:48.456
So we, we are thrilled to
be here with other writers,

00:02:49.290 --> 00:02:53.623
but mostly to see that there's
still so many readers in the world.

00:02:53.830 --> 00:02:57.496
Well, I'm a little cross-eyed
because I'm actually smack

00:02:58.020 --> 00:02:58.810
in the middle of a book
tour for my brand new novel,

00:03:00.630 --> 00:03:05.163
came out two weeks ago called the
Widower's Tale, and I can tell you,

00:03:05.360 --> 00:03:06.333
thank you, that the number
one question I'm getting

00:03:07.720 --> 00:03:11.720
from early readers is this one,
where in the world did I come

00:03:12.170 --> 00:03:16.570
up with my lasted protagonist, this
cranky, eloquent, vital, veral,

00:03:18.640 --> 00:03:21.240
romantic, snobbish,
mildly chauvinistic,

00:03:23.220 --> 00:03:26.286
politically irreverent,
retired male librarian,

00:03:28.290 --> 00:03:29.290


00:03:29.340 --> 00:03:31.740
and he's not based on Dr. Belington.

00:03:33.140 --> 00:03:34.016
Anyway, that is the kind of
question that I most like hearing,

00:03:36.330 --> 00:03:40.396
because every story, I create,
begins with a single character.

00:03:41.390 --> 00:03:44.990
If you, the reader, can't
fully enter the mind and soul

00:03:45.500 --> 00:03:45.746
of my protagonist, you don't
have to like them necessarily;

00:03:49.120 --> 00:03:53.120
at least not to begin with,
you're not going to like my book.

00:03:53.540 --> 00:03:54.940
And, when I get a bad
review, I can always tell it's

00:03:55.540 --> 00:03:59.073
because the reviewer just
couldn't stand my character.

00:03:59.970 --> 00:04:03.703
Often the characters personality
comes in to focus first.

00:04:03.900 --> 00:04:08.366
That was the case with Fenno McLeod,
in my first novel, Three Junes,

00:04:08.660 --> 00:04:11.726
a good heart and a clean
mind, shrouded by fear

00:04:12.710 --> 00:04:14.376
and emotional inhibition.

00:04:15.700 --> 00:04:18.966
True, also, with Greenie
Duquette, the pastry chef

00:04:19.150 --> 00:04:23.350
who takes center stage in my
second novel, The Whole World Over.

00:04:23.560 --> 00:04:24.130
I wanted to write about a woman
whose confidence and gusto

00:04:26.790 --> 00:04:30.523
for life defined her weaknesses
as well as her strengths.

00:04:31.720 --> 00:04:31.866
And, sometimes a character
comes to me

00:04:34.040 --> 00:04:36.840
with a predicament more
than a personality.

00:04:36.920 --> 00:04:39.653
As the novelist John
Ducrane likes to say,

00:04:39.790 --> 00:04:42.056
"Fiction, it's only about trouble.

00:04:43.260 --> 00:04:45.793
Without trouble, you've
got no tension,

00:04:45.950 --> 00:04:48.283
no suspense, and in fact, no story.

00:04:50.090 --> 00:04:54.423
Trouble may come from inside the
character, the urge to go to sea,

00:04:55.170 --> 00:04:58.370
a disturbing childhood
memory, or even a disease.

00:04:59.900 --> 00:05:00.316
Or trouble might come from outside
the character, the child she gave

00:05:03.950 --> 00:05:07.683
up for adoption tracks her
down, her country goes to war,

00:05:09.170 --> 00:05:13.036
a tree branch severed in a
violent storm falls on her head.

00:05:13.640 --> 00:05:14.450
Or the character might make a
choice that begets the trouble,

00:05:16.830 --> 00:05:19.563
have an affair, buys
a house, quits a job.

00:05:21.650 --> 00:05:25.050
But trouble it the one thing
we can always count on.

00:05:25.500 --> 00:05:26.833
In fact, I've always said
that fiction writers have

00:05:27.500 --> 00:05:31.166
to be part sadist, because
it's our job to inflict a lot

00:05:31.860 --> 00:05:33.993
of pain on the people we create.

00:05:34.600 --> 00:05:35.406
But, sometimes I think of a
novel's plot as nothing more

00:05:37.460 --> 00:05:37.576
or less complicated
than an obstacle course,

00:05:40.210 --> 00:05:42.876
a decathlon requiring
a variety of feats,

00:05:43.560 --> 00:05:45.626
some practical, some spiritual.

00:05:46.800 --> 00:05:46.993
In a Julia Glass novel,
you make sure that a number

00:05:49.940 --> 00:05:51.673
of feats will be familial.

00:05:53.030 --> 00:05:57.630
The lucky individual who gets to run
this course, it's always my first

00:05:58.000 --> 00:06:02.133
and most important character,
who will come to me unexpectedly,

00:06:02.220 --> 00:06:02.980
when I'm mindlessly rolling along
in my everyday groove, showering,

00:06:05.860 --> 00:06:09.460
shopping, driving, cooking,
getting the kids to school,

00:06:10.300 --> 00:06:13.900
the garbage on the street,
the groceries in the fridge.

00:06:14.360 --> 00:06:18.560
From that character sprouts other
characters, parents, children,

00:06:19.390 --> 00:06:21.790
colleagues, neighbors and even pets.

00:06:23.240 --> 00:06:23.543
The story of this one individual
grows the way a sapling becomes a

00:06:27.270 --> 00:06:30.003
tree, the trunk widens,
the bark thickens,

00:06:31.600 --> 00:06:36.200
limbs proliferate bearing leaves and
flowers and then fruit, squirrels

00:06:37.340 --> 00:06:40.206
and birds move in, the
occasional cat prowls

00:06:41.000 --> 00:06:42.866
through in search of a meal.

00:06:43.410 --> 00:06:44.083
Each of my novels, by the time I'm
finished, feels like a complete

00:06:47.070 --> 00:06:50.803
and self-sustaining cosmos,
that I never forget the seed,

00:06:51.620 --> 00:06:55.020
that one character who
seeped into my consciousness.

00:06:55.780 --> 00:06:58.846
I may even remember
precisely when it happened.

00:06:59.840 --> 00:07:03.640
Percival Darling, the eponymous
hero of The Widowers Tale,

00:07:05.280 --> 00:07:09.680
I have to say I love that word
eponymous, it sounds like a creature

00:07:09.880 --> 00:07:10.893
from Greek Mythology like a
cross between and elephant

00:07:12.400 --> 00:07:13.510
and a Shetland pony or something,
I love that word eponymous.

00:07:15.290 --> 00:07:20.090
So, Percival Darling came to me on a
late winter's night in January 2005.

00:07:22.820 --> 00:07:25.553
After 24 years of living
in New York City,

00:07:25.780 --> 00:07:29.246
a fellowship had lured me
north, along with my family

00:07:30.160 --> 00:07:31.960
to my native Massachusetts.

00:07:32.510 --> 00:07:36.843
My parents were still living in
the house where I lived from age 9

00:07:36.870 --> 00:07:39.136
through all of my college summers,

00:07:39.180 --> 00:07:41.980
and I decided to rent
another house nearby.

00:07:42.520 --> 00:07:42.693
By happenstance, it
was the former home

00:07:44.880 --> 00:07:44.993
of my best friend from
junior high school.

00:07:47.500 --> 00:07:51.633
Its rooms and scrolling lawns,
familiar to me in a general way,

00:07:52.030 --> 00:07:52.546
but now, three decades and many
occupants later, completely strange.

00:07:55.980 --> 00:07:59.246
So, there was a very
surreal quality to this move.

00:07:59.420 --> 00:08:01.220
So, there I was, after more

00:08:01.420 --> 00:08:01.773
than a quarter century's
residence elsewhere,

00:08:04.000 --> 00:08:04.300
living again in my childhood town,
a place that's astonishingly rural,

00:08:08.300 --> 00:08:12.833
for a community just half and hour's
drive from Boston, where houses,

00:08:12.950 --> 00:08:16.483
both historic and modern,
are sheltered by thick woods

00:08:17.350 --> 00:08:20.950
or command sweeping views of
pastures and placid ponds.

00:08:22.650 --> 00:08:23.116
When I was young, it
was home to a lot

00:08:24.650 --> 00:08:28.250
of what I called barefoot
intellectuals, absent-minded,

00:08:28.470 --> 00:08:32.803
Ivy League professors, modernist
architects, quazee-hippie lawyers

00:08:33.640 --> 00:08:36.906
and doctors married to
trust-fund origami artists.

00:08:37.510 --> 00:08:38.510
[Laughter]

00:08:40.050 --> 00:08:40.360
Years later, through my frequent
but brief holiday visits,

00:08:43.540 --> 00:08:44.053
the town had [inaudible]
reassuringly unchanged.

00:08:46.160 --> 00:08:46.483
So, I was aware that the
real estate prices had soared

00:08:49.370 --> 00:08:49.696
and if I looked closely, I noticed
how many of the rustic crooked edges

00:08:53.710 --> 00:08:57.243
on the landscape had been
straightened, how the catena

00:08:57.860 --> 00:09:01.526
of things, once left to the
anarchy of time and weather,

00:09:01.680 --> 00:09:03.746
had been scrubbed and polished.

00:09:04.310 --> 00:09:07.176
A few fine but unpretentious
houses appeared

00:09:07.420 --> 00:09:08.170
to have sprouted stone
pillars at the entrance

00:09:09.670 --> 00:09:13.336
to their long driveways, and
the Victorian town library,

00:09:13.430 --> 00:09:16.296
where I'd spent hours
as an underpaid Paige,

00:09:17.310 --> 00:09:21.976
a building both stately and frumpy,
had received a [inaudible] makeover

00:09:22.020 --> 00:09:23.753
from a renowned architect.

00:09:24.420 --> 00:09:27.086
Tumbled stone walls
had been disciplined.

00:09:27.120 --> 00:09:29.520
Trees that once formed
shaggy tunnels

00:09:29.660 --> 00:09:31.726
above the roads had been tamed.

00:09:32.100 --> 00:09:35.900
Some of those roads, once
narrow and chaotically potholed,

00:09:36.260 --> 00:09:38.126
were wider and smoother now.

00:09:38.670 --> 00:09:42.536
But, not until I lived there
full-time as an adult shopping

00:09:42.630 --> 00:09:43.066
and picking up my mail at the
quaintly antique post office,

00:09:46.060 --> 00:09:46.376
as a parent with children
in the local schools,

00:09:48.810 --> 00:09:51.210
did I see how much more had changed.

00:09:51.980 --> 00:09:56.046
The social zeitgeist of the town,
due to its pumped up wealth,

00:09:56.560 --> 00:10:01.293
seemed to have become simultaneously
more liberal and more conservative.

00:10:02.190 --> 00:10:05.990
The politically correct idealism
of raw milk cooperatives,

00:10:06.640 --> 00:10:11.040
hot yoga classes, and composting
workshops, in direct contradiction

00:10:12.910 --> 00:10:16.776
to four thousand square foot
house, and gas guzzling SUV's,

00:10:18.110 --> 00:10:18.196
taking my children to
birthday parties, I discovered,

00:10:21.490 --> 00:10:21.570
deep in the woods, new
developments of houses,

00:10:24.410 --> 00:10:24.476
that looked like country clubs.

00:10:26.410 --> 00:10:27.076
Complete with in-ground
sprinkler systems

00:10:28.410 --> 00:10:30.476
and video surveillance cameras,

00:10:30.580 --> 00:10:31.270
with signs on the lawn
reading, "Saved Our Four".

00:10:33.090 --> 00:10:34.090
[Laughter]

00:10:35.170 --> 00:10:39.836
These people clearly wanted to have
their cake and save the planet too.

00:10:41.660 --> 00:10:45.126
No longer did local teens
shovel snow or plant grass.

00:10:46.330 --> 00:10:50.530
Instead, platoons of Hispanic,
of Hispanic workers shuttled back

00:10:51.710 --> 00:10:55.776
and forth on flatbed trucks,
with squadrons of lawn equipment.

00:10:56.750 --> 00:10:56.830
Some of the changes I saw were
simply a sign of the times,

00:11:00.470 --> 00:11:04.870
but some of them felt like a sign
of a decadence portending a fall.

00:11:06.060 --> 00:11:06.403
Here's something that
particularly amused and annoyed me.

00:11:09.450 --> 00:11:09.673
The abundant wildlife, attracted
to the ample woods and swamps,

00:11:13.360 --> 00:11:14.100
which back in my childhood was
taken for granted as something

00:11:16.620 --> 00:11:20.753
to celebrate, had become, to many
new residence, pure nuisance.

00:11:22.120 --> 00:11:22.916
The deer that dependably ate all the
tulips, if you were foolish enough

00:11:25.990 --> 00:11:30.190
to plant tulips, the raccoons
that would raid your garbage cans,

00:11:30.300 --> 00:11:30.673
the barn swallows, that having
set up house in an open shed,

00:11:33.860 --> 00:11:37.526
would dive bomb your dog and
your car and your children,

00:11:38.000 --> 00:11:41.333
once their fledglings were
hatched, the fisher cats

00:11:42.240 --> 00:11:45.706
that would snatch any house
cats left out after dark.

00:11:45.820 --> 00:11:46.686
A new neighbor of my
parents that complained

00:11:47.820 --> 00:11:48.043
that wild turkeys enjoying the
warm tarmac in front of her garage,

00:11:51.930 --> 00:11:54.796
were constantly preventing
her from parking.

00:11:54.990 --> 00:11:55.020
And, at one town meeting while
I was there, dog owner lobbied

00:11:58.960 --> 00:12:03.293
to have horses barred from the
towns miles of conservation trails.

00:12:03.550 --> 00:12:07.950
What if the horses stepped on their
dogs or what if, heaven forbid,

00:12:07.990 --> 00:12:10.190
their dogs should eat the manure?

00:12:10.730 --> 00:12:14.463
I began to feel vaguely
offended, as if I owned the town,

00:12:15.770 --> 00:12:16.076
as if its citizens had any
obligation to preserve the place

00:12:19.330 --> 00:12:23.396
as I had known it, my personal
snow globe of lazy days reading

00:12:23.900 --> 00:12:27.700
in unkempt hayfields, surrounded
by Joanie Mitchell songs,

00:12:28.170 --> 00:12:32.770
rotary lawn mowers, rusted Volvo's,
the reassuring, self-righteousness

00:12:33.340 --> 00:12:37.473
of Eugene McCarthy era outrage,
that typified the views of most

00:12:37.860 --> 00:12:42.060
of the residence back then,
except, I might add, for my parents,

00:12:42.260 --> 00:12:42.666
the token old world Republicans
who's contrarian views kept me

00:12:45.920 --> 00:12:46.720
thoroughly and appropriately
embarrassed throughout my teens.

00:12:49.120 --> 00:12:52.320
But, when I was eleven or
so, in the late 1960's,

00:12:52.790 --> 00:12:56.123
a perfectly stenciled peace
sign, two-stories high,

00:12:56.460 --> 00:12:58.526
appeared on the side of a barn.

00:12:58.630 --> 00:12:58.990
So, there I was, having
lived in the is familiar,

00:13:01.470 --> 00:13:02.093
yet disturbingly different
town for five months,

00:13:03.980 --> 00:13:06.113
when a spectacular blizzard hit.

00:13:06.370 --> 00:13:10.036
It snowed for a day and a
night and most of another day.

00:13:10.360 --> 00:13:10.610
That second night, after my boys
were in bed, I bundled up and went

00:13:14.510 --> 00:13:18.643
for a walk down a long wooded
lane, now a tunnel of waited bows

00:13:19.350 --> 00:13:22.616
and tall banks of snow,
made blue by the darkness.

00:13:23.250 --> 00:13:23.300
Deep in the woods to either
side, the houses glowed.

00:13:26.600 --> 00:13:29.000
Here, I thought, was
the town I knew.

00:13:29.260 --> 00:13:32.526
Its new fangled glossiness
erased by the elements.

00:13:33.430 --> 00:13:33.466
Yet, if I looked closely
through the window,

00:13:36.260 --> 00:13:36.446
I could see the ostentatious
prosperity that stood

00:13:39.340 --> 00:13:41.873
for everything I had
become to despise.

00:13:42.870 --> 00:13:46.536
I recognized myself, not for
the first time, by the way,

00:13:47.320 --> 00:13:51.986
as a premature kremudgin [phonetic],
not yet 50, railing against a kind

00:13:52.810 --> 00:13:52.840
of change that is, at least on
the surface, harmless, selfish

00:13:56.780 --> 00:13:56.966
and myopic perhaps, but
in the global scheme

00:13:59.460 --> 00:14:01.126
of things, fairly benign.

00:14:01.460 --> 00:14:02.020
I stood still in the
middle of the road,

00:14:03.500 --> 00:14:06.566
glaring into a blindly
well-lit, far too large,

00:14:07.450 --> 00:14:11.183
granite appointed kitchen,
and I imagined a cantankerous,

00:14:11.930 --> 00:14:13.730
fossilized old-timer, a man

00:14:14.290 --> 00:14:14.553
who can no longer tolerate how fast
the world is changing around him,

00:14:18.560 --> 00:14:21.026
mostly because its
leaving him behind.

00:14:22.470 --> 00:14:26.670
And, I knew that in this man, an
alter ego of my least tolerant,

00:14:27.690 --> 00:14:31.690
least adaptable self, I'd found
the genesis of my next novel.

00:14:33.360 --> 00:14:35.760
Why a man, not a woman, I can't say,

00:14:36.100 --> 00:14:36.370
though maybe the gender switch
was a way of holding this part

00:14:39.830 --> 00:14:41.563
of myself at arm's length.

00:14:42.230 --> 00:14:45.496
I began to think a lot
about the nature of change.

00:14:46.460 --> 00:14:49.993
Whether its technological,
intellectual, or aesthetic,

00:14:50.790 --> 00:14:54.523
what it gives us, what it
wipes out, the risk and dangers

00:14:55.190 --> 00:14:58.456
that always come with its
privileges and luxuries.

00:14:59.080 --> 00:14:59.676
I thought, too, about the subtle
evolution that takes place

00:15:02.350 --> 00:15:06.350
when our youthful selves, who
earn for change, who can't find

00:15:06.830 --> 00:15:10.963
or make change fast enough, turn
a corner and begin to fear it.

00:15:11.430 --> 00:15:14.363
When does progress begin
to resemble entropy,

00:15:15.300 --> 00:15:17.833
a threat to civilization
as we know it.

00:15:18.990 --> 00:15:20.103
Eventually, this chain of
daydreaming lead me to conceive

00:15:21.610 --> 00:15:26.343
of the novels second most important
characters, Percy's grandson Robert,

00:15:26.470 --> 00:15:26.506
a 20 year old, pre-med student,
who becomes involved with a group

00:15:30.700 --> 00:15:33.500
of bold, but naive
environmental activists.

00:15:35.160 --> 00:15:35.360
Within days of dreaming up Percy,

00:15:37.160 --> 00:15:37.373
the title of the novel
came to me as well.

00:15:39.680 --> 00:15:42.080
I'd call it, Everything Must Change.

00:15:42.750 --> 00:15:46.950
In the end, I changed my mind
about that, but never about Percy.

00:15:48.350 --> 00:15:48.583
The tree that night, on
that road, in my beloved

00:15:51.250 --> 00:15:54.716
but irreversibly altered
hometown, had begun to grow.

00:15:56.110 --> 00:15:57.533
And now, I want to say a little
bit about fiction in general

00:15:58.620 --> 00:16:01.020
and the heroes that
fiction contains.

00:16:01.830 --> 00:16:02.960
Rumors about the death of fiction,
the end of the novel have become

00:16:05.100 --> 00:16:07.233
so common that they're tiresome.

00:16:07.890 --> 00:16:11.356
But, it's true that one day
we could wake up and find

00:16:11.680 --> 00:16:15.280
that nobody we know bothers
to pick up stories anymore,

00:16:16.240 --> 00:16:18.573
or even download the onto a screen.

00:16:18.970 --> 00:16:19.990
I actually have a friend that
told me that he read Ana Karina

00:16:21.950 --> 00:16:23.883
in two different translations

00:16:23.950 --> 00:16:24.473
on his iPhone this past
summer, blew my mind.

00:16:26.360 --> 00:16:27.610
I think one of those Russian names
would take up the entire screen.

00:16:29.510 --> 00:16:30.510
[Laughter]

00:16:33.060 --> 00:16:37.193
Maybe we'll feel a vague nostalgia
for novels and short stories

00:16:37.340 --> 00:16:41.340
and for poetry too, the way you
might feel nostalgic for cars

00:16:41.550 --> 00:16:45.283
of the 1950's or drive-in
theatres, or Polaroid camera's,

00:16:46.370 --> 00:16:49.236
or as writers sometimes
do, for typewriters.

00:16:49.440 --> 00:16:50.036
Do you remember the bell that would
ring every time you reach the right

00:16:53.510 --> 00:16:54.510
hand margin?

00:16:55.510 --> 00:16:57.776
The swoosh of the carriage return?

00:16:58.010 --> 00:16:58.290
But, unlike carriage returns, novels
and stories are irreplaceable.

00:17:02.130 --> 00:17:02.746
Nothing we know in our culture,
with the possible exception

00:17:05.380 --> 00:17:09.446
of very good movies, which, as
we know, are increasingly rare,

00:17:09.530 --> 00:17:13.063
can possibly fulfill what
novels and short stories do.

00:17:14.340 --> 00:17:17.940
Fiction reminds me of the
space program, an opportunity

00:17:18.520 --> 00:17:22.453
for noble exploration that many
people now view as frivolous

00:17:23.130 --> 00:17:27.396
or irrelevant, yet, if we put an
end to it, we may lose, forever,

00:17:28.370 --> 00:17:28.403
the chance to glimpse distant
realms filled with revelations

00:17:32.270 --> 00:17:34.403
that we can't begin to guess at.

00:17:35.000 --> 00:17:35.950
A friend of mine recently shared
with me a graduation speech,

00:17:38.050 --> 00:17:38.423
that was given by Alexis
Mobahill, and English teacher

00:17:41.210 --> 00:17:41.593
at a private high school in Berkley
California, addressing a group

00:17:45.160 --> 00:17:47.493
of people on the cusp of adulthood,

00:17:47.680 --> 00:17:48.096
she told them why they
must keep reading books,

00:17:50.330 --> 00:17:53.996
fiction in particular, and
I'm going to quote from this.

00:17:54.490 --> 00:17:54.853
"We are living through an
age that feels, at times,

00:17:57.460 --> 00:17:59.926
like a constantly rebooting
emergency.

00:18:01.470 --> 00:18:05.336
Things are dire and then oil
spills and earthquakes happen,

00:18:05.650 --> 00:18:09.116
pushing us into a new, more
horrifying sense of dire.

00:18:10.350 --> 00:18:11.883
Was it always this way?

00:18:12.350 --> 00:18:13.350
I'm not sure.

00:18:14.350 --> 00:18:14.820
Maybe this is a new awful, or maybe
it isn't, but I know, for sure,

00:18:18.280 --> 00:18:18.673
that as you move through your
life, our world will call to you,

00:18:22.020 --> 00:18:26.420
will require time and effort and
compassion and ingenuity from you.

00:18:26.810 --> 00:18:27.826
Some of you will go to work
for doctors without borders,

00:18:29.460 --> 00:18:29.703
and some of you will work
on climate change issues,

00:18:32.550 --> 00:18:33.270
and some of you will become
lawyers, who help people

00:18:35.230 --> 00:18:38.563
in need fight a system that
seems set against them.

00:18:39.470 --> 00:18:43.870
Some of you will raise children,
or teach, or paint, or own a shop,

00:18:44.730 --> 00:18:47.730
and that will be the way
you position yourself

00:18:48.000 --> 00:18:50.133
between vulnerability and chaos.

00:18:51.580 --> 00:18:53.023
No matter what you do with your
life and your talents, however,

00:18:54.270 --> 00:18:58.003
you will need to cultivate
compassion, to open yourselves

00:18:58.500 --> 00:19:01.900
to people who need you,
even if they are all the way

00:19:02.140 --> 00:19:04.073
across this great wide world.

00:19:05.420 --> 00:19:06.360
To be a citizen of this world, with
any chance of being productive,

00:19:08.880 --> 00:19:09.006
or at least maintaining your sanity,
you will need to practice, empathy

00:19:13.420 --> 00:19:15.353
and intellectual imagination.

00:19:16.380 --> 00:19:17.066
The reading of literature
will help you with this,

00:19:18.960 --> 00:19:19.240
because it speaks straight to the
heart of your life, and to the lives

00:19:23.280 --> 00:19:25.146
of everyone else around you.

00:19:25.620 --> 00:19:29.620
Reading is an opportunity for
the purest possible compassion,

00:19:31.850 --> 00:19:32.043
a chance to channel
another life, another place,

00:19:34.790 --> 00:19:36.590
another time, another soul.

00:19:37.690 --> 00:19:41.756
A novel is like a portable
church, an opportunity for passion,

00:19:42.370 --> 00:19:46.903
and compassion, for community, for
communion, confession, reflection,

00:19:49.440 --> 00:19:51.706
redemption, elevation, revelation.

00:19:54.290 --> 00:19:54.536
Novels are centers of
feeling of a nerve,

00:19:56.710 --> 00:19:59.576
they are performers of
our highest humanity.

00:20:01.210 --> 00:20:05.810
You will need this opportunity to
practice the way the world will be."

00:20:06.860 --> 00:20:10.793
In closing, I'd like to read
you part of an email I received

00:20:12.560 --> 00:20:16.760
from a friend of mine, who read
my new novel, a man in his 30's.

00:20:17.410 --> 00:20:20.610
Dear Julie, You've written
another marvelous book

00:20:20.740 --> 00:20:24.940
with the coolest 70 year old I
have ever encountered in fiction.

00:20:26.970 --> 00:20:31.503
He skinny-dips, he flirts, he flirts
when shopping for bathing suits,

00:20:32.990 --> 00:20:35.790
he is indifferent to
the charm of toddlers.

00:20:37.110 --> 00:20:41.710
His story, his tale, shows life as
funny, tragic, confounding, joyful,

00:20:44.920 --> 00:20:47.986
regretful, hopeful,
ordinary, and even magical.

00:20:50.200 --> 00:20:52.600
In other words, life
as it really is.

00:20:53.930 --> 00:20:57.530
Percy is my hero, and if he
were gay and I were single,

00:20:58.900 --> 00:21:01.700
I would be asking you
for his phone number.

00:21:01.900 --> 00:21:02.900


00:21:03.150 --> 00:21:04.470
That's the great, when
somebody wants a phone number

00:21:05.230 --> 00:21:07.430
for an email for your characters.

00:21:08.230 --> 00:21:09.230


00:21:09.240 --> 00:21:10.646
By the end of the book, I marveled
at how many people his special combo

00:21:12.500 --> 00:21:14.833
of archness and warmth had touched.

00:21:15.290 --> 00:21:19.823
I can see Percy now, swimming across
the harbor in the September sun.

00:21:21.010 --> 00:21:21.243
I know that despite his recent
trials, he swims with some sense

00:21:24.910 --> 00:21:27.510
of satisfaction that
he's done his best.

00:21:27.690 --> 00:21:31.556
I can only hope that I'll be
doing something similar at 71.

00:21:32.630 --> 00:21:32.966
I said earlier in this talk, that
what I always hope is that you,

00:21:36.560 --> 00:21:36.833
the reader, will be able to fully
enter my characters, but really,

00:21:40.620 --> 00:21:42.353
it's the other way around.

00:21:42.620 --> 00:21:46.020
What I want is for my
characters to fully enter you.

00:21:46.960 --> 00:21:49.426
When the heroes I create
become heroes

00:21:49.630 --> 00:21:52.163
to my readers, I know
I've done my job.

00:21:52.830 --> 00:21:55.830
I've enlarged my readers
vision of themselves,

00:21:55.850 --> 00:21:56.533
magnified the way they seem
themselves in a world that is

00:21:58.900 --> 00:22:02.700
as fragile and tender as it
can be brutal and frightening,

00:22:04.220 --> 00:22:08.353
inspired them to leap their own
hurdles, and live as gracefully

00:22:09.890 --> 00:22:10.126
as they possibly can, with
whatever changes come their way.

00:22:13.520 --> 00:22:14.520
Thank you.

00:22:15.000 --> 00:22:16.000


00:22:16.020 --> 00:22:17.020
[ Clapping ]

00:22:28.310 --> 00:22:29.176
So, I think I have time
for a few questions,

00:22:30.310 --> 00:22:34.176
if anybody has any questions
at all, about any of my books.

00:22:36.360 --> 00:22:37.620
&gt;&gt;Actually, I haven't read any
of your books, but I might.

00:22:38.900 --> 00:22:40.100
&gt;&gt;Julia: You're here for
Ken Follett, aren't you.

00:22:40.900 --> 00:22:43.433
You're just holding
a place, I knew it.

00:22:52.860 --> 00:22:53.860
It's okay.

00:22:54.860 --> 00:22:55.780
&gt;&gt;But, as a participant in
this National Book Festival,

00:22:57.540 --> 00:23:00.473
how do you feel about
the electronic readers?

00:23:02.630 --> 00:23:05.430
&gt;&gt;Julia: How do I fell
about the e-readers?

00:23:07.890 --> 00:23:07.973
You know, I used to feel
hostile toward them,

00:23:10.740 --> 00:23:11.600
as I have felt hostile toward
every technological advance,

00:23:13.680 --> 00:23:14.013
until I had to get it into my life.

00:23:15.680 --> 00:23:15.813
This is what I think about them.

00:23:17.680 --> 00:23:21.613
I think that any, any medium
that makes it easier for people

00:23:23.430 --> 00:23:25.230
to read stories is welcome.

00:23:28.160 --> 00:23:32.293
My only objection is the price
point that's been set up by some

00:23:32.500 --> 00:23:32.770
of the merchants, namely Amazon,
and, the issues that authors

00:23:36.230 --> 00:23:39.430
and agents are trying to
work out with publisher.

00:23:39.990 --> 00:23:44.656
I mean, the truth is, we make a lot
less money when you download a book

00:23:46.580 --> 00:23:50.380
than if you buy it, but you
know what, it's great, I mean,

00:23:50.430 --> 00:23:52.896
I have to tell you
I was hugely amused

00:23:53.910 --> 00:23:56.176
by this friend reading Ana Karina,

00:23:57.520 --> 00:24:01.253
he downloaded two different
translations and he'd go back

00:24:02.190 --> 00:24:05.923
and forth, and I just thought,
okay, if that's the future

00:24:08.730 --> 00:24:11.663
of reading literature,
then let's go with it.

00:24:11.940 --> 00:24:12.940
&gt;&gt;Thank you.

00:24:13.940 --> 00:24:14.940
&gt;&gt;Julia: Yes.

00:24:15.940 --> 00:24:17.073
&gt;&gt;Hi, its, I enjoyed so
much the first two books

00:24:17.940 --> 00:24:19.873
and the character Fenno and I
wondered where that came about

00:24:19.940 --> 00:24:20.540
and is there a Fenno
in the third novel?

00:24:21.940 --> 00:24:23.406
&gt;&gt;Julia: Well, as I, as I
said earlier, Fenno McLeod,

00:24:23.940 --> 00:24:25.273
the hero of Three Junes,
and as, I think he also is

00:24:25.940 --> 00:24:27.806
in the Whole World Over, really
came out of a corner of me.

00:24:27.940 --> 00:24:29.873
He's sort of, he's a part of
me that was a very emotionally,

00:24:29.940 --> 00:24:31.673
cautious, fearsome person.

00:24:31.940 --> 00:24:34.473
I'm not quite that person anymore,
though I have tendencies that way,

00:24:33.940 --> 00:24:35.006
and I wanted to sort of
write a cautionary tale

00:24:35.940 --> 00:24:37.540
for myself in some ways.

00:24:37.940 --> 00:24:40.540
But, he's also the case of character
that I never dreamed would become

00:24:39.940 --> 00:24:41.873
as big as he did in the book.

00:24:41.940 --> 00:24:43.873
I thought it was going to be
really the story of his father,

00:24:43.940 --> 00:24:44.540
and I really fell in
love with him, and,

00:24:45.940 --> 00:24:46.806
and he's a character I
may not be done with.

00:24:47.940 --> 00:24:48.940
I don't know.

00:24:49.940 --> 00:24:51.673
I don't mean to be coy, but
I'm thinking about him a lot.

00:24:51.940 --> 00:24:52.940
Yes.

00:24:53.940 --> 00:24:55.206
&gt;&gt;Thank you for being the
warm up for Mr. Follett,

00:24:55.940 --> 00:25:09.013
I think you've done a great job.

00:24:45.000 --> 00:24:46.000


00:24:57.940 --> 00:24:59.473
[Clapping and Laughing]

00:24:59.940 --> 00:25:01.006
&gt;&gt;Julia: Thanks.

00:25:01.940 --> 00:25:02.673
&gt;&gt;And, first, I wanted
to congratulate you

00:25:03.940 --> 00:25:06.540
for apparently writing a book about
a male, who is multi- dimensional,

00:25:05.940 --> 00:25:08.673
who's not perfect, but who has some
positive characteristics and traits.

00:25:07.940 --> 00:25:09.140
Given that, an earlier
author this morning seemed

00:25:09.940 --> 00:25:11.073
to have a very strong
dislike of men in general,

00:25:11.940 --> 00:25:14.340
as she made several comments that
were not very positive about men.

00:25:13.940 --> 00:25:14.940
But, my question to you
has to do with process

00:25:15.940 --> 00:25:18.006
and what you need as an author.

00:25:18.620 --> 00:25:23.086
And would your satisfaction about
writing your novel be as complete,

00:25:23.850 --> 00:25:25.516
if there were no readers?

00:25:25.960 --> 00:25:27.466
&gt;&gt;Julia: Wow, you started out
talking about my writing men,

00:25:28.320 --> 00:25:29.390
and then you're, are you
asking me two questions,

00:25:30.450 --> 00:25:30.973
or you just wanted to
comment on the male?

00:25:32.660 --> 00:25:33.616
&gt;&gt;No, I just commented on
that, but I wanted to ask you,

00:25:35.370 --> 00:25:35.703
from your perspective as an author.

00:25:37.370 --> 00:25:37.903
&gt;&gt;Julia: What would
it be like to have,

00:25:39.370 --> 00:25:40.103
to know that I was
writing for no readers?

00:25:41.370 --> 00:25:42.570
&gt;&gt;No, it's exactly, as a
writer, is it necessary,

00:25:43.370 --> 00:25:45.570
and I think you were alluding to
it a little bit towards the end

00:25:45.370 --> 00:25:48.636
of your presentation, is
it necessary for a writer

00:25:49.310 --> 00:25:49.323
to have readers for the
novel to be truly complete?

00:25:52.630 --> 00:25:53.630
&gt;&gt;Julia: Okay.

00:25:54.630 --> 00:25:56.630
Oh, well, is it necessary for
the novel to be truly complete,

00:25:56.630 --> 00:25:57.253
maybe not, but I will say this,
the most, people ask me, you know,

00:26:00.340 --> 00:26:01.590
what was the most surprising
thing to happen to you,

00:26:02.490 --> 00:26:05.023
when you had your first
novel come out.

00:26:05.040 --> 00:26:06.623
It might be winning the
National Book Award, that's true,

00:26:07.190 --> 00:26:07.723
but I will tell you
that when I started

00:26:09.190 --> 00:26:10.460
to meet total strangers who'd
invested their precious time

00:26:11.720 --> 00:26:13.113
in reading my books and wanted to
meet me and talk to me about it,

00:26:14.660 --> 00:26:19.126
blew my mind, and I have to say
readers are my number one addiction,

00:26:19.720 --> 00:26:19.806
so I'd go through terrible
withdrawal if I lost readers.

00:26:23.300 --> 00:26:25.233
I've got to know I have them.

00:26:25.300 --> 00:26:27.436
But, you know, writing that first
novel without a contract, without,

00:26:27.630 --> 00:26:28.180
you know, just in a cave, was
a very different experience,

00:26:30.880 --> 00:26:31.540
that sometimes I wish I
could recapture a little,

00:26:33.420 --> 00:26:37.953
because sometimes I have to stop
myself and not think too much about,

00:26:38.370 --> 00:26:39.200
about what I know about
people who've read my books,

00:26:40.940 --> 00:26:41.156
what they expect, you
know, what they hope for.

00:26:43.790 --> 00:26:47.456
It's important to keep, to
keep a little at arm's length

00:26:48.790 --> 00:26:51.990
when you write, but I
don't know what it would be

00:26:52.130 --> 00:26:52.753
like to write my books
without readers, at this point.

00:26:55.040 --> 00:26:55.440
It is, I think it is
important actually.

00:26:57.240 --> 00:26:58.240
&gt;&gt;Thank you.

00:26:59.240 --> 00:27:00.240
&gt;&gt;Julia: Yeah.

00:27:01.240 --> 00:27:02.240
&gt;&gt;Hello.

00:27:03.240 --> 00:27:04.240
&gt;&gt;Julia: Hi.

00:27:05.240 --> 00:27:06.973
&gt;&gt;Your speech was amazing.

00:27:07.240 --> 00:27:08.040
You sort of answered
my question partially,

00:27:09.240 --> 00:27:11.040
I just wondered what your
inspiration for Three Junes was?

00:27:11.240 --> 00:27:12.906
&gt;&gt;Julia: My inspiration for
Three Junes, well, you know,

00:27:13.240 --> 00:27:14.096
every book is a sum of
so many life experience.

00:27:15.450 --> 00:27:16.603
You know, Three Junes grew
out of a time in my life

00:27:17.630 --> 00:27:18.630
that I've often talked
about, I think I talked

00:27:19.630 --> 00:27:19.753
about it here the first time I came,
I had a really rotten mid-thirties.

00:27:24.240 --> 00:27:28.373
I lost my only sibling to suicide,
I was diagnosed with cancer,

00:27:29.490 --> 00:27:33.690
and I went through a divorce, and
you know, it was a terrifying,

00:27:35.590 --> 00:27:37.523
demoralizing time in my life,

00:27:37.800 --> 00:27:38.836
and that's when I started writing
Three Junes, but I didn't know,

00:27:41.030 --> 00:27:42.060
until after it came out, and
people started to talk about it,

00:27:44.000 --> 00:27:48.133
that it really is a book about
enduring the kind of heartbreak,

00:27:49.350 --> 00:27:49.626
regret and emotional fear that
you think you're never going

00:27:52.940 --> 00:27:53.940
to get through.

00:27:54.940 --> 00:27:57.740
You know, and really, it's true that
all the novels that I love the best,

00:27:56.940 --> 00:28:01.140
are about nothing more than human
endurance and also our ability

00:28:01.400 --> 00:28:03.266
to rise above our own folly.

00:28:03.700 --> 00:28:05.043
I'm always interested by how,
and I know this from my own life,

00:28:06.490 --> 00:28:07.060
how do really really smart,
good hearted people make

00:28:09.320 --> 00:28:09.373
such stupid mistakes, and then
live with the consequences

00:28:13.000 --> 00:28:14.513
of those mistakes, and live
through them and beyond them,

00:28:15.220 --> 00:28:15.856
and I know that's what
Three Junes came out of,

00:28:17.650 --> 00:28:19.850
but I didn't know it at the time.

00:28:19.930 --> 00:28:20.930
&gt;&gt;Thank you.

00:28:21.930 --> 00:28:23.196
&gt;&gt;Julia: Thank you.

00:28:23.930 --> 00:28:25.396

00:28:25.930 --> 00:28:26.330
Well, I'm going to
move over for Ken.
