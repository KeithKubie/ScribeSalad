00:00:02.380 --> 00:00:05.800
Hey,
what's going on?
It's Bill Burr and It's time for the Monday morning now.

2
00:00:05.801 --> 00:00:09.370
It isn't.
Oh God dammit.
It's time for the Thursday afternoon.

3
00:00:09.371 --> 00:00:12.640
Just before Friday.
Monday morning podcast

4
00:00:14.230 --> 00:00:15.640
and um,
dre,

5
00:00:15.641 --> 00:00:20.641
big of checking in on you.

6
00:00:21.940 --> 00:00:25.000
Just like the Frat Gold Cantar.
Yeah.
Um,

7
00:00:25.460 --> 00:00:26.293
<v 0>okay.</v>

8
00:00:26.930 --> 00:00:29.210
<v 1>Do they have Christmas music and other countries?</v>

9
00:00:30.320 --> 00:00:33.770
Is it strictly in American thing?
I can't imagine.

10
00:00:33.771 --> 00:00:35.450
You're in England and they give a shit

11
00:00:36.990 --> 00:00:41.990
about bing Crosby go on where the trees are glistening and chill.

12
00:00:45.450 --> 00:00:47.570
Dread lists
too.

13
00:00:47.850 --> 00:00:51.000
They don't even have like enough fields over there for sleigh bells to go

14
00:00:51.001 --> 00:00:53.940
through.
Right.
There's no fucking room over there in England.

15
00:00:53.941 --> 00:00:58.190
It's all been developed.
That's why we ended up coming over here.

16
00:00:58.191 --> 00:01:00.170
Was it because of religious differences?

17
00:01:00.440 --> 00:01:05.060
There was too much urban sprawl over the AA.
Even back in the 16 hundreds.

18
00:01:06.780 --> 00:01:06.820
<v 0>Yeah.</v>

19
00:01:06.820 --> 00:01:09.670
<v 1>That's why people's teeth in England is so God damn crooked.</v>

20
00:01:09.700 --> 00:01:12.670
It's not because they don't take care of the teeth are all mashed together.

21
00:01:14.680 --> 00:01:19.060
I'm sorry.
I had no intention of getting on this podcast and insulting,

22
00:01:20.560 --> 00:01:25.540
um,
the great state of England.
You know,
there's a lot of great states out there,

23
00:01:25.570 --> 00:01:28.330
right?
Rhode Island,
Connecticut in England,

24
00:01:29.380 --> 00:01:32.080
England is an incredible state.
It's about the size of New Jersey.

25
00:01:34.050 --> 00:01:36.850
You've got to admit,
man,
for such a small country,
they,
they,
you know,

26
00:01:38.340 --> 00:01:38.800
it definitely,

27
00:01:38.800 --> 00:01:42.950
definitely let themselves be known around the world for better or for worse,

28
00:01:42.951 --> 00:01:47.830
depending on what side are the queen you're sitting on.
MMM.

29
00:01:48.560 --> 00:01:50.770
Why would I,
I don't even,
what the fuck I'm talking about?
You know,

30
00:01:50.780 --> 00:01:53.570
I don't give a shit because technically I'm on vacation.

31
00:01:54.830 --> 00:01:55.663
<v 0>Okay.</v>

32
00:01:55.890 --> 00:01:56.900
<v 1>Um,
I don't even feel that.</v>

33
00:01:56.901 --> 00:02:00.390
I don't even feel like I need to be making an effort at this point.

34
00:02:02.340 --> 00:02:05.660
Um,
who knows.
I'll probably lose another fucking advertising.

35
00:02:05.980 --> 00:02:08.060
We're trying to sell a,

36
00:02:08.180 --> 00:02:10.970
we're trying to sell pencils over and you'd the United Kingdom,

37
00:02:11.050 --> 00:02:12.440
but we just felt some of your,

38
00:02:12.710 --> 00:02:17.710
some of your statements to just went beyond comedy and just can't get into a

39
00:02:19.490 --> 00:02:23.300
area that we didn't feel was inclusive.

40
00:02:24.850 --> 00:02:25.030
<v 0>Okay.</v>

41
00:02:25.030 --> 00:02:26.740
<v 1>Those people,
everything's a question.</v>

42
00:02:27.430 --> 00:02:29.530
They're like literally taking the piss out of you and say,
you know,

43
00:02:29.531 --> 00:02:31.510
I just felt like you're not,

44
00:02:31.540 --> 00:02:34.960
we just feel like you're not doing the job we need to be done.

45
00:02:35.200 --> 00:02:36.400
That needs to be done

46
00:02:38.640 --> 00:02:42.870
and that you're going to be unemployed during the holidays.

47
00:02:44.360 --> 00:02:46.400
That would be best for [inaudible].

48
00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:47.833
<v 0>Okay.</v>

49
00:02:48.960 --> 00:02:53.960
<v 1>The ultimate passive aggressiveness is you walk around and you don't have the</v>

50
00:02:55.281 --> 00:02:59.090
common decency just to just be standing there flat footed,

51
00:02:59.350 --> 00:03:03.820
be the client that you are.
Instead you do everything with questions.

52
00:03:07.030 --> 00:03:11.410
So that's when I stole your password for your bank account

53
00:03:13.500 --> 00:03:17.010
and depleted all your savings.
So I'm sorry,

54
00:03:19.820 --> 00:03:24.500
I'm writing this from the Cayman Islands.
MMM.

55
00:03:25.940 --> 00:03:30.280
Anyways,
I'm back.
I'm back.
I'm back in Boston baby.

56
00:03:30.360 --> 00:03:35.260
A lot of bees there.
Literally Shawn,
the racial past blue ribbon number,

57
00:03:35.270 --> 00:03:36.103
Cajun man.

58
00:03:36.650 --> 00:03:41.360
Adam Sandler weekend update back in the day when I was young.
Um,

59
00:03:41.810 --> 00:03:45.320
I'm back here in Boston and uh,

60
00:03:45.350 --> 00:03:50.150
this is my first Christmas as a dad.
It's pretty exciting.
I,
uh,

61
00:03:50.151 --> 00:03:53.180
made a promise to myself that I was not going to flip out

62
00:03:54.870 --> 00:03:56.560
and all that.
I was just going to be,

63
00:03:56.561 --> 00:04:01.090
I was going to be as rosy as my daughter's cheeks are right now because she's

64
00:04:01.091 --> 00:04:01.924
teething.

65
00:04:03.910 --> 00:04:08.910
And I was able to do that until I picked up the rental car.

66
00:04:13.060 --> 00:04:16.180
I lost my shit twice,
maybe three times.

67
00:04:17.050 --> 00:04:21.430
I vaguely remember taking my hat off and throwing it as hard as I can down at

68
00:04:21.431 --> 00:04:23.830
the empty passenger's seat,
you know,

69
00:04:24.070 --> 00:04:26.740
like it was the end of the game and there was a terrible call.

70
00:04:26.980 --> 00:04:29.020
Like somebody scored a touchdown and they said,
oh wait,

71
00:04:29.021 --> 00:04:32.410
you didn't make a football move and now I've gotta be on the road during the

72
00:04:32.411 --> 00:04:36.640
playoffs.
Play off.
All right,
here's what happened.

73
00:04:37.670 --> 00:04:42.010
Um,
we had a very early flight and,
uh,

74
00:04:42.220 --> 00:04:45.580
and this is the first time I was flying.
No,
no second time.

75
00:04:45.880 --> 00:04:47.560
Second time flying with my wife and daughter.

76
00:04:47.561 --> 00:04:50.980
But the first time we did my Kiddo was so young,
you know what I mean?

77
00:04:50.981 --> 00:04:55.480
It was like bringing a loaf of bread with you,
you know,

78
00:04:55.540 --> 00:04:59.710
she was really into being held back then snuggled in,
all that type of stuff.

79
00:04:59.711 --> 00:05:03.860
Well,
now my kids mobile go in mode.
Wow.

80
00:05:04.260 --> 00:05:07.770
All right.
I believe she's what they call cruising at this point,

81
00:05:07.771 --> 00:05:12.771
which means she can pull herself up on a table and then walk side decided to

82
00:05:13.080 --> 00:05:14.460
like all kinds of stuff like that.

83
00:05:14.461 --> 00:05:17.580
Although yesterday she actually let go over table,

84
00:05:17.581 --> 00:05:20.880
turned around and then reached for something else.

85
00:05:20.881 --> 00:05:23.850
Now she's never done that before.
What she would do,
it'd be like,
wow,

86
00:05:23.851 --> 00:05:28.680
that's way over there.
I'm not going to go down,
sit on my butt,

87
00:05:29.400 --> 00:05:32.820
crawl half a step,
and then pull myself back up again.
This is the first time,

88
00:05:33.270 --> 00:05:37.520
you know,
she did sort of a wrestling move,
like coming off the rope,

89
00:05:37.521 --> 00:05:39.660
spinning around.
She did everything but a flying kick.

90
00:05:39.661 --> 00:05:43.870
So my days are numbered as far as
you know,

91
00:05:43.920 --> 00:05:47.790
being able to stick her in a general area and turning my back and expecting her

92
00:05:47.791 --> 00:05:52.750
to still be there.
Um,
so now,
yeah,
she wants to move around.

93
00:05:52.751 --> 00:05:56.710
I gotta tell you something.
She was an absolute angel on the plane.

94
00:05:58.390 --> 00:05:59.810
Oh wait.
Am I hearing other shit here?

95
00:06:02.520 --> 00:06:02.860
<v 2>Ready?</v>

96
00:06:02.860 --> 00:06:05.740
<v 1>What in the fuck has that been going on?
The whole podcast?
Sorry,</v>

97
00:06:05.741 --> 00:06:09.250
I had my headphones on.
What?
Fucking advertiser.

98
00:06:10.690 --> 00:06:13.630
Oh,
that's right.
That's right.
I was on Google plus.
Well,

99
00:06:13.631 --> 00:06:15.880
I'm sorry for the Guy Mumbling in the background,

100
00:06:17.460 --> 00:06:19.010
but it wasn't some crazy relative.

101
00:06:21.500 --> 00:06:21.870
<v 2>Yeah.</v>

102
00:06:21.870 --> 00:06:25.470
<v 1>This is some old guy talking about how the US and the Chai Cheney,</v>

103
00:06:25.500 --> 00:06:27.090
China need to communicate.

104
00:06:28.570 --> 00:06:29.650
<v 2>Oh,
is that what we need to do?</v>

105
00:06:30.910 --> 00:06:33.850
<v 1>Why don't we all just fucking leave each other alone?
How about that?</v>

106
00:06:34.600 --> 00:06:37.210
How about we stay over here?
You stay over there.

107
00:06:37.270 --> 00:06:38.940
You shoot your missiles at yourself.

108
00:06:39.130 --> 00:06:42.310
We'll fucking throw shit ourselves if we feel like we want to kill somebody.

109
00:06:42.311 --> 00:06:43.144
Why don't we just do it?

110
00:06:43.300 --> 00:06:47.770
Why does it everybody in the world just grow the Fuck Up,
Huh?

111
00:06:50.590 --> 00:06:54.730
All of this bullshit about fucking going to war and all of that crap.

112
00:06:54.880 --> 00:06:59.020
It's just a bunch of rich people at the top throwing temper tantrums because

113
00:06:59.021 --> 00:07:02.560
they want some sort of oil or they want some sort of land.

114
00:07:02.561 --> 00:07:06.460
They want some sort of water outlet or they don't feel that you're praying to

115
00:07:06.461 --> 00:07:09.940
the right fucking person or they don't like your form of government.

116
00:07:09.941 --> 00:07:12.960
Who gives a fuck?
You know?

117
00:07:13.370 --> 00:07:18.160
You'd think I like all of my neighbors.
I don't dislike any of my neighbors.

118
00:07:18.161 --> 00:07:19.300
But you know,
in the past

119
00:07:21.040 --> 00:07:24.790
I haven't liked my neighbor's music.
I,
when I lived in New York,

120
00:07:24.791 --> 00:07:26.710
I didn't like the smell of their food.

121
00:07:26.950 --> 00:07:30.100
I didn't like listening to them arguing or fucking or whatever.

122
00:07:30.101 --> 00:07:32.890
You know what you do in New York City.
But did I ever go,

123
00:07:33.130 --> 00:07:35.220
did I go on the fucking warpath

124
00:07:39.040 --> 00:07:40.990
did I?
Did I fucking,
you know,

125
00:07:41.350 --> 00:07:44.920
suck a punch somebody as they came walking out of the apartment though,
I didn't.

126
00:07:44.921 --> 00:07:49.020
You know why?
Because I'm a fucking adult.
All right.

127
00:07:49.560 --> 00:07:52.600
And I think they get tagged time that Democrats or Republicans,

128
00:07:52.630 --> 00:07:57.190
the Pentagon and everyone ran a whole bucket.
Just grow up.

129
00:07:58.510 --> 00:08:00.220
Just fucking grow up already.

130
00:08:01.430 --> 00:08:01.620
<v 2>Yeah.</v>

131
00:08:01.620 --> 00:08:04.230
<v 1>I gotta be honest.
You,
I cannot believe that war is still illegal.</v>

132
00:08:04.890 --> 00:08:09.710
The risk of sounding like a fucking tree hugger.
I can't believe that it's a,
a,

133
00:08:09.720 --> 00:08:11.790
it's still legal.
You know what this is.

134
00:08:11.791 --> 00:08:14.370
This is my simple theory that I worked out by myself,

135
00:08:14.371 --> 00:08:17.250
so there was no one there to argue with me,
so it completely makes sense.

136
00:08:17.790 --> 00:08:22.790
I definitely believe that you have to be a little sick to want to lead a nation.

137
00:08:26.770 --> 00:08:29.590
<v 2>Um,
so</v>

138
00:08:30.470 --> 00:08:35.450
<v 1>I think that yeah.
Got a lot of fucking complete lunatics in power and they,</v>

139
00:08:35.451 --> 00:08:37.760
they make those choices like a,

140
00:08:39.480 --> 00:08:43.920
like what's his face,
Martin Sheen in the dead zone.
The birds in a way.

141
00:08:44.580 --> 00:08:45.413
<v 2>Yeah.</v>

142
00:08:46.030 --> 00:08:50.020
<v 1>Gentlemen,
the birds are away,
right.
That's kind of how I look at,
uh,</v>

143
00:08:51.510 --> 00:08:55.770
most of these fucking people that run corporations and all of type of shit.

144
00:08:57.980 --> 00:08:58.790
<v 2>MMM.</v>

145
00:08:58.790 --> 00:09:00.950
<v 1>And I dunno what happened.
This all just got depressing,</v>

146
00:09:00.951 --> 00:09:03.140
which is why I don't watch the fucking news.

147
00:09:04.700 --> 00:09:07.400
I feel there's plenty of water.
There's plenty of food.

148
00:09:07.640 --> 00:09:11.690
There's plenty of room for everybody.
If everybody would just fucking relax,

149
00:09:12.970 --> 00:09:13.570
you know,

150
00:09:13.570 --> 00:09:17.140
and quick peek and over your fence to see what other people have and just be

151
00:09:17.141 --> 00:09:18.790
happy with what the fuck you have.

152
00:09:19.180 --> 00:09:22.540
We can have a nice Jane farmer's market every Sunday.
Okay.

153
00:09:25.070 --> 00:09:30.050
Oh,
you got a barrel oil?
Oh yeah,
we,
we got a box of snickers bars.
How about that?

154
00:09:30.051 --> 00:09:34.100
We'll do a little fucking change here.
Um,
anyways,

155
00:09:34.400 --> 00:09:37.160
so I'm flying on the Goddamn five.
I'm sorry for the fucking audio.

156
00:09:37.161 --> 00:09:38.570
I don't have time to change that shit.

157
00:09:38.600 --> 00:09:40.770
I apologize for the Guy Mumbling in the background.

158
00:09:42.410 --> 00:09:43.220
<v 2>MMM.</v>

159
00:09:43.220 --> 00:09:46.640
<v 1>It's soda.
My,
my tribute to dark side of the moon.
You know,
that guy's mumbling.</v>

160
00:09:46.641 --> 00:09:49.730
All that shit.
There really is no dark side of the moon.
It's all dark.

161
00:09:51.860 --> 00:09:52.693
<v 2>MMM.</v>

162
00:09:53.310 --> 00:09:57.030
<v 1>So we did great on the plane.
Everybody was loving my daughter over there.</v>

163
00:09:57.330 --> 00:10:00.420
She was just peeking over the seats,
waving at everybody.

164
00:10:01.080 --> 00:10:05.340
Flight attendants were carrying her,
walking up and down the aisle.
It was great.

165
00:10:06.840 --> 00:10:10.560
Um,
by the end,
she had everybody loving or just smiling and waving.

166
00:10:10.561 --> 00:10:13.290
I'm going to try that on a flight.
I'm going to start peaking over the seat,

167
00:10:13.291 --> 00:10:18.090
just smiling and waving at people like fucking lunatic.
Oh my gosh.

168
00:10:18.960 --> 00:10:21.090
I was a fucking song is in my head.

169
00:10:21.170 --> 00:10:26.170
I know our daughter has this little little car that when you fucking turn it on,

170
00:10:27.960 --> 00:10:32.640
how's it [inaudible] and I love driving on the road to,

171
00:10:32.730 --> 00:10:36.300
to be,
be grabbing all the way around the town,

172
00:10:36.330 --> 00:10:40.680
waving to all I need smiling,
waving B,

173
00:10:40.710 --> 00:10:44.430
B
over and over again.

174
00:10:46.710 --> 00:10:49.650
So anyways,
I did great.
On the flight by,
yeah.
You know,

175
00:10:49.651 --> 00:10:53.730
I made a promise that I wasn't going to flip out this whole,
this whole trip.

176
00:10:54.290 --> 00:10:55.123
<v 2>Wow.</v>

177
00:10:56.110 --> 00:11:00.380
<v 1>I would say I was able to do it until the rental car.
Right.</v>

178
00:11:01.050 --> 00:11:04.330
All right.
All right.
We're going to eat.
Okay.
Text me when you're done.

179
00:11:04.660 --> 00:11:08.050
Just stay here working during my vacation.
Thanks for coming in and helping out.

180
00:11:10.150 --> 00:11:11.380
Definitely when you're done.
Okay.

181
00:11:13.160 --> 00:11:14.260
<v 2>MMM [inaudible]</v>

182
00:11:14.770 --> 00:11:16.030
<v 1>so anyways,
I,
I,</v>

183
00:11:16.300 --> 00:11:21.300
we go to get off the plane and it's the usual battle between a man and a woman.

184
00:11:22.390 --> 00:11:27.070
The guy's thinking,
okay,
we checked bags.
We also have to pick up a rental car.

185
00:11:28.440 --> 00:11:28.620
<v 2>Yeah.</v>

186
00:11:28.620 --> 00:11:31.790
<v 1>This is going to be all these fucking people there.
All right.</v>

187
00:11:32.810 --> 00:11:35.750
It's going to be a bunch of people traveling is going to take forever to get the

188
00:11:35.751 --> 00:11:38.180
bags.
Why don't I,

189
00:11:38.960 --> 00:11:42.740
while you guys wait to get the bags,
I'll get on the fucking bus,

190
00:11:43.250 --> 00:11:46.130
the rental car bus and I will go over

191
00:11:47.690 --> 00:11:49.160
to pick up the fucking rental car.

192
00:11:52.430 --> 00:11:54.040
You know?
And my

193
00:11:54.040 --> 00:11:57.820
<v 2>wife is a Homerun,
right?
Always was a woman by the way.</v>

194
00:11:57.821 --> 00:12:01.840
She did not transition just to be progressive.
And give all you the information.

195
00:12:03.480 --> 00:12:04.313
MMM.

196
00:12:05.350 --> 00:12:08.230
<v 1>She's a hormone.
So she wants to be social.</v>

197
00:12:08.970 --> 00:12:12.690
<v 3>Oh,
I thought we can all go there together.</v>

198
00:12:13.980 --> 00:12:15.990
Why?
No,
this is me.
I'm a tell you right now.

199
00:12:16.410 --> 00:12:20.940
I though we could all go there together.
She just gave me the finger.

200
00:12:23.190 --> 00:12:25.740
<v 1>Uh,
and I'm like,
honey,</v>

201
00:12:27.360 --> 00:12:32.220
we have three check bags.
I didn't want to check a bag.
I was going to travel.

202
00:12:32.580 --> 00:12:37.180
Oh good.
My kids,
kids screaming in there.
Um,

203
00:12:38.610 --> 00:12:39.750
I didn't want to check a bag.

204
00:12:39.780 --> 00:12:42.780
I was just going to pack like I was going to go do a funny bone or some shit.

205
00:12:42.781 --> 00:12:46.500
Right.
Couple pairs of pants,
a couple of headliners,
shirts,

206
00:12:47.010 --> 00:12:49.770
sweatpants and a t shirt.
Right.
But she's just saying,
what if,

207
00:12:49.771 --> 00:12:54.330
what if we go out to eat?
What if we get some Christmas kids too?

208
00:12:54.331 --> 00:12:57.840
We need space.
Could you just please?

209
00:12:58.870 --> 00:13:03.630
Very good giant bag.
So I took out my fucking bag that,

210
00:13:03.780 --> 00:13:04.590
you know,

211
00:13:04.590 --> 00:13:08.490
I didn't even use the last time I went to Europe because I finally learned how

212
00:13:08.491 --> 00:13:09.510
to fucking pack.

213
00:13:12.200 --> 00:13:16.040
So we had three of those fucking things.
So I'm like,
honey,

214
00:13:17.510 --> 00:13:20.840
we're going to get off the plane first cause we're riding up front like fancy

215
00:13:20.841 --> 00:13:21.674
people.

216
00:13:22.700 --> 00:13:26.390
We're going to stand down there for a good 1520 minutes while the rest of the

217
00:13:26.391 --> 00:13:27.500
people filed down.

218
00:13:28.040 --> 00:13:31.460
And then we'll stand there for another five minutes before the belt turns on.

219
00:13:32.600 --> 00:13:35.150
And then after the belt turns on and everybody's excited,

220
00:13:35.180 --> 00:13:40.030
it's just going to shut off.
And then everybody's going to be like,
what the fuck?

221
00:13:40.150 --> 00:13:44.440
And then another belt,
two belts over,
it's going to turn on.
Okay.

222
00:13:45.370 --> 00:13:48.310
And some smarty pants is going to figure out that that's actually where our

223
00:13:48.311 --> 00:13:49.144
flight is,

224
00:13:49.210 --> 00:13:53.440
except he's not going to tell anybody cause he's a selfish cunt and he's going

225
00:13:53.441 --> 00:13:54.370
to stand over there.

226
00:13:54.371 --> 00:13:58.060
And then gradually people will start noticing faces from their flight,

227
00:13:58.510 --> 00:14:00.310
two belts over,
getting bags,

228
00:14:00.311 --> 00:14:04.090
not telling everybody so they can get out in the taxi line before anybody else.

229
00:14:04.510 --> 00:14:06.730
Then there's going to be a stampede of fucking people.

230
00:14:06.940 --> 00:14:08.640
This is basically what's going to happen.

231
00:14:08.650 --> 00:14:11.080
And this is the reason why I don't check a bag.

232
00:14:12.280 --> 00:14:13.113
<v 2>Okay?</v>

233
00:14:14.670 --> 00:14:19.670
<v 1>But in loyalty and dedication to you
in our little family unit,</v>

234
00:14:19.730 --> 00:14:24.650
I chose to do that.
So all of this shit's going to be going down.
All right?

235
00:14:24.651 --> 00:14:27.860
As we stand there going,
what the fuck's going on?

236
00:14:28.130 --> 00:14:32.750
Meanwhile I can be over there getting the car,
all right?

237
00:14:33.050 --> 00:14:36.230
And then I could get the car and just as the belt starts,

238
00:14:36.231 --> 00:14:40.790
I could already be driving back smiling,
waving B,
B.

239
00:14:41.390 --> 00:14:45.740
Right?
I like picking up my car to,

240
00:14:45.741 --> 00:14:48.530
to be be.
Um,

241
00:14:50.110 --> 00:14:52.430
so much to my surprise,
she goes

242
00:14:52.610 --> 00:14:56.760
<v 2>all okay.
And I'm like,
yes.
Right?</v>

243
00:14:58.890 --> 00:15:01.410
<v 1>So I don't know if you guys have ever been to Boston,</v>

244
00:15:01.411 --> 00:15:05.160
but I don't know what this fucking city has against signage.

245
00:15:05.460 --> 00:15:08.760
They have plenty of signs,
but none really tell you where to go.

246
00:15:09.390 --> 00:15:14.250
They're all sort of vague and there's arrows pointing you in the general

247
00:15:14.251 --> 00:15:18.840
direction.
And then at the last second,
the place you want to be after,

248
00:15:18.841 --> 00:15:21.420
you want to make the turn right behind that road.

249
00:15:21.421 --> 00:15:23.910
As you're driving 40 miles an hour will be assigned,

250
00:15:24.150 --> 00:15:26.430
pointing at the road that you're currently passing

251
00:15:28.050 --> 00:15:31.050
with whatever it is that you're looking for.
In the smallest print

252
00:15:31.260 --> 00:15:33.750
<v 2>ever.
So</v>

253
00:15:35.390 --> 00:15:38.870
<v 1>I get on the bus,
I walk out the buses right there.
I'm like,
Bam,</v>

254
00:15:40.170 --> 00:15:41.003
<v 2>all right,</v>

255
00:15:41.340 --> 00:15:44.100
<v 1>I have my fucking,
you know,</v>

256
00:15:44.700 --> 00:15:48.420
I got my confirmation number and everything.
I see some dad coming out,
his,

257
00:15:48.570 --> 00:15:52.830
his family all gets on the bus.
He has to carry ons in a child seat.

258
00:15:52.980 --> 00:15:57.840
Where's the wife?
She's with the kids.
She carried the kids on,

259
00:15:57.870 --> 00:16:01.860
you know the ones that can walk with their own power and they'd go and sit down.

260
00:16:01.861 --> 00:16:06.861
So this poor bastard runs back to the curb to get the child seat.

261
00:16:08.250 --> 00:16:11.670
All these fucking assholes on the bus or just staring at the guy.

262
00:16:13.300 --> 00:16:17.860
It's like people,
we're all in the same team here.
We can't go until this guy.

263
00:16:17.861 --> 00:16:21.310
This poor bastard gets all this shit on the bus.
How about you help out?
Right.

264
00:16:22.430 --> 00:16:25.330
Everybody stand in this.
So the guy comes fucking running over.

265
00:16:25.840 --> 00:16:28.240
He's got this stupid chair,
the child's seat things.

266
00:16:28.241 --> 00:16:30.040
So I just reach out and he hands it to me,

267
00:16:31.320 --> 00:16:32.153
<v 2>right?</v>

268
00:16:33.070 --> 00:16:37.060
<v 1>And he just fucking,
I don't even think he said thank you.
He fucking runs back.</v>

269
00:16:37.090 --> 00:16:40.810
I put the chair up where it needs to go.
He shows up with the other two bags.

270
00:16:40.811 --> 00:16:42.880
I help them up with one,
blah,
blah,
blah,
blah,
blah.

271
00:16:43.120 --> 00:16:46.810
And he sets everything down and I'm waiting for a big,
hey man,
thanks a lot.

272
00:16:47.200 --> 00:16:50.980
You know,
little dad,
fist bump,
he doesn't say anything.

273
00:16:50.981 --> 00:16:52.960
He just looks at his wife and smiles and goes,

274
00:16:52.961 --> 00:16:56.740
they're all on and then walks back to where his wife and kids are.

275
00:16:57.100 --> 00:17:01.810
And all I'm thinking is,
what a fucking,
where's my pat on the back?

276
00:17:03.430 --> 00:17:06.370
I didn't have to do that.
It didn't say a fucking word.

277
00:17:06.850 --> 00:17:08.730
So then immediately in my head I'm like,
oh,
this kid,

278
00:17:08.780 --> 00:17:12.400
he's got a fucking management position does and he's got an expense account.

279
00:17:13.570 --> 00:17:15.970
You know,
like he'd be on the fucking rental car bus.
I was just like,

280
00:17:15.971 --> 00:17:19.930
you know what?
Fuck this guy.
This guy,
somebody's boss and he's a Douche.

281
00:17:19.990 --> 00:17:21.220
I shouldn't have done that.
Right?

282
00:17:22.030 --> 00:17:22.863
<v 2>Whatever.</v>

283
00:17:23.640 --> 00:17:24.900
<v 1>So the bus is pulling up,</v>

284
00:17:24.901 --> 00:17:27.960
it's fucking jam packed with people and I'm doing a fucking head count,
right?

285
00:17:27.961 --> 00:17:29.010
We go by the Blue Line,

286
00:17:29.430 --> 00:17:33.120
a third of the bus gets off and aren't thinking is a fuck.

287
00:17:33.270 --> 00:17:36.690
I recently just switched over to hertz because budget has their head up their

288
00:17:36.691 --> 00:17:37.524
ass.

289
00:17:38.500 --> 00:17:39.333
<v 2>So</v>

290
00:17:40.170 --> 00:17:44.100
<v 1>all I'm thinking is I gotta get off this fucking bus and I gotta be part of that</v>

291
00:17:44.101 --> 00:17:48.210
first third so I'm not standing in the line cause my wife is probably,

292
00:17:48.211 --> 00:17:50.970
God knows now that over here it's probably getting the bags and she's going

293
00:17:51.100 --> 00:17:55.300
<v 4>be like,
see it wasn't that it.
See I was actually right.</v>

294
00:17:56.590 --> 00:17:57.423
See

295
00:17:58.650 --> 00:17:59.483
<v 1>so anyways,</v>

296
00:18:00.480 --> 00:18:00.920
<v 0>yeah</v>

297
00:18:00.920 --> 00:18:04.790
<v 1>the bus doors open.
I'm the second person off the bus.</v>

298
00:18:04.850 --> 00:18:08.090
It's one of those buses that's dragging another bus.
That's how big it is.

299
00:18:09.230 --> 00:18:11.090
And I shamelessly,

300
00:18:11.240 --> 00:18:15.200
with my backpack sprint past everybody.

301
00:18:16.340 --> 00:18:20.350
Sprint 49 years old.
Alright.

302
00:18:20.410 --> 00:18:21.430
Sprinting.

303
00:18:21.550 --> 00:18:23.480
<v 5>But it ended at the,
the bed</v>

304
00:18:26.730 --> 00:18:27.060
[inaudible]

305
00:18:27.060 --> 00:18:32.060
<v 1>fucking running NFL films could have filmed this and showed it and fucking slow</v>

306
00:18:32.641 --> 00:18:33.420
motion,
right?
Yeah.

307
00:18:33.420 --> 00:18:35.710
<v 5>Burn it.
Baron and baron about apparently.
Okay.</v>

308
00:18:36.090 --> 00:18:38.880
<v 1>Bucket run by everybody.
I'm the first person in,</v>

309
00:18:40.290 --> 00:18:44.690
there's one person in line and hurts and he's already being helped and I fucking

310
00:18:44.730 --> 00:18:49.490
run
all the way up and I'm right fucking there and wouldn't,

311
00:18:49.650 --> 00:18:51.600
you know,
I couldn't believe it.

312
00:18:51.601 --> 00:18:56.070
There was some other lady up there and she just goes,
hello sir,
welcome to hurts.

313
00:18:56.670 --> 00:19:00.000
Can I help you out?
I'm like,
Oh my God,
this is so much better than budget.

314
00:19:01.780 --> 00:19:06.640
Okay.
I got my fucking reservation number ready cause I know,

315
00:19:06.910 --> 00:19:09.510
I know they're not going to have my car ready because this is everything.

316
00:19:09.520 --> 00:19:13.770
It's going,
it's going too good.
So she goes,

317
00:19:13.771 --> 00:19:17.130
what's the last name?
And I go bar.
She goes,
bar.
Oh,

318
00:19:17.131 --> 00:19:19.380
I have your reservation reservation right here.
I'm like,

319
00:19:19.490 --> 00:19:23.660
you've gotta be kidding me.
I goes in an SUV,

320
00:19:23.720 --> 00:19:26.840
it's an SUV.
Do you got a kid seat?
We got a kid.

321
00:19:26.840 --> 00:19:31.810
See you got one of those little Sadie save fucking Fucka um,

322
00:19:32.360 --> 00:19:37.190
passes so I can go through the goddamn tunnel.
Yes,
we do.
Bang,
Bang,

323
00:19:37.191 --> 00:19:41.480
boom.
By smiling wave.
And she's great.
I get it,
I go,

324
00:19:41.481 --> 00:19:43.910
you gotta be shitting me?
So I fucking walk out.

325
00:19:44.000 --> 00:19:48.850
I make a right space number nine 10 there she is.

326
00:19:48.851 --> 00:19:51.790
I throw my bags in the back.
I fucking get in the car

327
00:19:53.320 --> 00:19:56.770
now trying to figure out how to get out.
There's like 50 signs that say egg,

328
00:19:56.771 --> 00:19:57.341
the exit.

329
00:19:57.341 --> 00:20:00.580
I'm driving in a fucking circle trying to get out of there and I stuck to start

330
00:20:00.581 --> 00:20:05.250
losing my shit a little bit.
So every time I go to rent a car,

331
00:20:05.730 --> 00:20:09.210
I always have to double back because everything says exit.
Yeah,

332
00:20:10.680 --> 00:20:13.480
that'd be,
I'll says exit and then you realize,
oh,
that's for me.

333
00:20:13.510 --> 00:20:15.970
If I just pulled out here,
it's so fucking stupid.

334
00:20:17.900 --> 00:20:22.400
So I pull up and as you know,
I do the whole thing.
Hey,
thank you very much,

335
00:20:23.120 --> 00:20:25.010
Yada Yada Yada.
We'll see you later.
And then rides on pulling out and go,

336
00:20:25.011 --> 00:20:28.520
wait a minute,
is there a child seat in this thing?
I turn around,

337
00:20:28.720 --> 00:20:32.480
there's no child seat.
I just talked to the lady.

338
00:20:33.430 --> 00:20:34.130
<v 0>Yeah,</v>

339
00:20:34.130 --> 00:20:35.410
<v 1>the fucking way.</v>

340
00:20:38.030 --> 00:20:40.640
And she told me that it was going to be one in there like an asshole.

341
00:20:41.390 --> 00:20:42.800
I took her fucking word for it.

342
00:20:44.340 --> 00:20:47.830
I took a fucking word for it that these Goddamn fucking people,

343
00:20:47.950 --> 00:20:52.000
we're going to put up a car seat and then they don't have it and I'm driving out

344
00:20:52.250 --> 00:20:55.450
now.
I pull over and now there's somebody behind me beeping because I'm the

345
00:20:55.451 --> 00:20:57.880
continental who's like looking back in disbelief.

346
00:20:59.660 --> 00:21:02.280
I shut off the car.
I opened the back end.
That's right.

347
00:21:02.350 --> 00:21:04.370
And then I got back in to see that there was no car seats.

348
00:21:04.420 --> 00:21:06.890
So I'm starting to lose my shit.
This guy behind me beeps the horn.

349
00:21:08.330 --> 00:21:13.020
I'm trying not to get mad and I'm like,
fucking cock suckers.
Lose my mind.

350
00:21:13.021 --> 00:21:15.560
Now I've got to somehow figure out how to go back in.

351
00:21:18.240 --> 00:21:21.510
So driving around and my brain's going,
don't call your wife right now.

352
00:21:21.540 --> 00:21:26.190
Don't call your wife.
So what do I do?
Call my wife.

353
00:21:26.340 --> 00:21:30.720
She picks up the phone.
I go near these fucking assholes.

354
00:21:30.721 --> 00:21:34.920
Forgot to put a car seat in here.
She goes,
oh,
well we're here.
We have the bags.

355
00:21:34.921 --> 00:21:36.390
But they didn't.

356
00:21:36.391 --> 00:21:39.810
They lost my mom's bag and all of a sudden it's turning into planes,

357
00:21:39.811 --> 00:21:42.990
trains and automobiles.
This nice smooth trip.

358
00:21:44.340 --> 00:21:45.390
My kid was great,

359
00:21:46.320 --> 00:21:50.340
my wife agreed that I could break off and actually officially get the car while

360
00:21:50.341 --> 00:21:54.300
they wait for the bags.
They had my reservation,
they add every,

361
00:21:54.390 --> 00:21:58.950
all the Cutera mall that I needed in the car.
And I was like,
I knew it.

362
00:21:58.980 --> 00:22:02.790
I knew it was going to say.
And I just,
I,
uh,
somehow I went off on millennials,

363
00:22:02.820 --> 00:22:03.960
like they're running hurts.

364
00:22:03.961 --> 00:22:06.590
Like it's not a bunch of people from my generation and older.
Yeah.

365
00:22:08.290 --> 00:22:11.320
And I fucking threw my hat down screaming at the top of my lungs.

366
00:22:11.350 --> 00:22:13.660
Every curse word I could possibly muster up.

367
00:22:15.020 --> 00:22:19.950
Go on these God damn fucking millennials,
they can't fucking do anything right.

368
00:22:20.340 --> 00:22:23.280
Because they spend their entire life looking at a fucking screen.

369
00:22:24.510 --> 00:22:27.330
They can't solve any problems.
Cause anytime they have a problem,

370
00:22:27.510 --> 00:22:28.141
they either call,

371
00:22:28.141 --> 00:22:31.890
their parents are fucking Uber and somebody shows up and pulls them out,

372
00:22:31.920 --> 00:22:32.753
you know.

373
00:22:33.000 --> 00:22:33.833
<v 0>Okay.</v>

374
00:22:34.330 --> 00:22:36.850
<v 1>Like a fucking helicopter pilot in Vietnam.
Yeah.</v>

375
00:22:39.700 --> 00:22:43.150
Just comes chopper and in and lifts them up out of their fucking problems.

376
00:22:44.490 --> 00:22:46.090
So I fucking drive back

377
00:22:48.510 --> 00:22:52.440
and I fucking pull in and as I come walking around,

378
00:22:52.441 --> 00:22:55.680
getting ready for a battle,
this fucking hurt guy from parts comes walking out.

379
00:22:56.280 --> 00:22:59.790
He goes,
hey,
how are ya?
I go,
yeah,
I was supposed to have a child seat.

380
00:23:00.030 --> 00:23:02.400
I don't have one.
He goes,
well,
I can help you out with that.

381
00:23:04.450 --> 00:23:07.900
And I was,
he was so nice.
He defused all my anger.

382
00:23:09.800 --> 00:23:12.500
So he walks around the back,
he goes,
all right,
there's a child seats.

383
00:23:12.501 --> 00:23:15.500
Which one do you want?
How old are you?
She goes,
which one do you want?
I go,

384
00:23:15.501 --> 00:23:17.540
the one that's going to not make my kid die.

385
00:23:18.220 --> 00:23:20.340
I was still a little angry and he kind of gave me a look like,
oof.

386
00:23:20.420 --> 00:23:24.770
I was a little harsh.
So he goes,
I met,
how old is your kit?
I'm like,
11 months.

387
00:23:25.160 --> 00:23:26.270
And he goes,
all right,
we got to,

388
00:23:26.370 --> 00:23:29.790
we got a black one and we've got like a pinkish one a,
is it a boy or girl?
I go,

389
00:23:29.960 --> 00:23:32.390
it's a girl.
He goes,
I'll,
we'll get the pink one.
And then he literally,

390
00:23:32.391 --> 00:23:35.010
this a guy in his 60 [inaudible],
he goes,
not to say that,

391
00:23:35.260 --> 00:23:37.190
did Jenny Take Ron via have a boy?
And I said,
dude,

392
00:23:37.191 --> 00:23:42.130
you don't have to do that progressive shit with me any left.
You know,

393
00:23:43.090 --> 00:23:47.470
like,
it's fine
not to
say if you wanted to raise,

394
00:23:47.590 --> 00:23:51.580
you get gender neutral or your kid was already transitioning and 11 months,

395
00:23:51.660 --> 00:23:53.890
you know,
started doing all that shit,
covering his tracks,

396
00:23:53.891 --> 00:23:58.630
like he was fucking running for office.
So I'm like,
Oh my God,
this guy's great.

397
00:23:59.620 --> 00:24:02.650
As always,
I flipped out.
I'm a fucking asshole.
I should have looked.

398
00:24:02.710 --> 00:24:04.900
All I had to do was look,
and if I looked,

399
00:24:04.901 --> 00:24:07.690
I could have just met this guy would have been fine,
right?

400
00:24:09.370 --> 00:24:12.820
So he gives me the seat and the guy,
how do I get this in there?
He goes,
AH,

401
00:24:12.850 --> 00:24:17.850
legally I'm not allowed to put that seed in or tell you how to do it for legal

402
00:24:19.421 --> 00:24:22.990
purposes.
Any promptly turns and walks away

403
00:24:25.990 --> 00:24:28.160
and he's walked away.
I'm like,
so that's it.

404
00:24:28.910 --> 00:24:33.710
You just gotta walk away and he doesn't say a fucking word guy.
Smiley.
Just,

405
00:24:33.800 --> 00:24:36.080
I know we heard me just turned and walked away and that was it.

406
00:24:38.280 --> 00:24:41.460
And I was like,
oh,
so this is why the child's seat wasn't in there,

407
00:24:42.240 --> 00:24:43.680
because they're not going to put it in there,

408
00:24:44.490 --> 00:24:46.380
even though they know how to put it in there,

409
00:24:46.890 --> 00:24:48.780
but they don't want to have the liability.

410
00:24:49.530 --> 00:24:51.810
So of course now I go to put the fucking thing in there.

411
00:24:51.850 --> 00:24:55.920
I figured out how to Hook it in and this thing has enough God damn slack on it.

412
00:24:55.950 --> 00:25:00.480
It's like a fucking
give a see those youtube videos where they start,

413
00:25:00.481 --> 00:25:03.660
you know they're filming some kid that they're pulling down the street and like

414
00:25:03.661 --> 00:25:08.661
a fucking wagon or I dunno what a Boogie board or rezones skis with roller

415
00:25:08.881 --> 00:25:11.550
skates.
That's how this things flying around.
I was just like,
fuck it.

416
00:25:11.551 --> 00:25:16.110
We'll figure it out.
So I head back to United.

417
00:25:16.950 --> 00:25:18.960
Oh,
here's another great thing about Logan Airport.

418
00:25:19.080 --> 00:25:23.730
This is how bad signage is in Boston.
When you pull into Logan Airport,

419
00:25:23.731 --> 00:25:26.610
just to give you a heads up,
if you drive back with the fucking rental car,

420
00:25:27.690 --> 00:25:29.100
you're gonna drive into the airport.

421
00:25:29.101 --> 00:25:34.101
There's going to be a giant fucking sign with every air carrier that they have

422
00:25:34.381 --> 00:25:35.220
there at the airport.

423
00:25:35.790 --> 00:25:40.410
It'll say letter a United fucking air,

424
00:25:41.130 --> 00:25:45.480
uh,
air fucking Brazil,
blah,
blah,
blah,
blah,
blah,
blah,
blah,
blah,
blah.

425
00:25:45.510 --> 00:25:50.160
Be Delta,
American Airlines,
Air Ethiopia,
Yada,
Yada,

426
00:25:50.520 --> 00:25:54.690
Yada.
All A,
B,
c,
d,
All right,
you have to drive by,

427
00:25:55.620 --> 00:25:58.560
sift through every fucking airline there is.

428
00:25:59.280 --> 00:26:03.450
Okay as you drive and by 30 miles an hour with somebody beeping behind you.

429
00:26:04.290 --> 00:26:08.220
If you're lucky,
you find your airline.
And then for the love of God,

430
00:26:08.250 --> 00:26:09.660
memorize the letter.

431
00:26:10.530 --> 00:26:14.160
Because after that they're not listing any more fucking airlines.

432
00:26:14.760 --> 00:26:19.750
It's just going to say B,
c,
d,
that's all a,
B,
c,
d.

433
00:26:19.800 --> 00:26:22.260
And you got to remember what the fuck was mine.
Well,

434
00:26:22.590 --> 00:26:25.830
where I was picking up the rental car,

435
00:26:27.540 --> 00:26:29.220
I was already past that sign.

436
00:26:32.150 --> 00:26:35.480
So now I'm like,
what the fuck?
So I have to call Nia

437
00:26:37.320 --> 00:26:41.880
as I already went by a,
I'm like,
Nia,
what terminal you?

438
00:26:41.881 --> 00:26:42.710
And she asked him,

439
00:26:42.710 --> 00:26:46.230
he be right as I'm driving by beat and I fucking have to do this hard,
right?

440
00:26:46.231 --> 00:26:51.030
I go in there and then right as I pull in,
I see on the,
um,

441
00:26:52.520 --> 00:26:55.460
you know,
the exit where you turn in,
there's a sign that says be in a list.

442
00:26:55.461 --> 00:26:57.620
All of them,
all the airlines,
super small.

443
00:26:57.621 --> 00:27:01.400
But this is the greatest thing about Boston.
It's not before you get to the turn,

444
00:27:01.640 --> 00:27:03.170
it's right after it

445
00:27:05.320 --> 00:27:08.830
did the fucking worst out here.
So we pull in.

446
00:27:09.590 --> 00:27:09.860
<v 2>Okay.</v>

447
00:27:09.860 --> 00:27:10.910
<v 1>And uh,
you know,</v>

448
00:27:10.911 --> 00:27:14.060
and of course it takes me another three phone calls once I'm in B to figure out

449
00:27:14.061 --> 00:27:15.320
where the hell my wife is.

450
00:27:17.050 --> 00:27:17.330
<v 2>Okay.</v>

451
00:27:17.330 --> 00:27:19.010
<v 1>We then fill up the fucking car.</v>

452
00:27:19.890 --> 00:27:20.290
<v 2>Yeah.</v>

453
00:27:20.290 --> 00:27:20.710
<v 1>You know,</v>

454
00:27:20.710 --> 00:27:25.190
there's not enough fucking room because they gave us like a midsize SUV.

455
00:27:25.630 --> 00:27:26.231
I mean,
actually,

456
00:27:26.231 --> 00:27:31.180
thank God my mother in law's a bag didn't come because we wouldn't have had the

457
00:27:31.181 --> 00:27:34.660
fucking room anyways,
ended up being on the next flight and she got us.

458
00:27:34.661 --> 00:27:37.930
Thank God for that.
So,
but now I'm thinking like when we go back to the airport,

459
00:27:37.931 --> 00:27:40.600
I have to put somebody in a fucking cab with their bag.

460
00:27:42.420 --> 00:27:44.610
<v 2>Um,
and then</v>

461
00:27:45.980 --> 00:27:48.980
<v 1>I get on.
So I've already lost my shit.
I lost it twice.</v>

462
00:27:49.610 --> 00:27:52.170
<v 2>All right.
Once calling up the yet.</v>

463
00:27:53.210 --> 00:27:54.140
<v 1>I guess that's once.</v>

464
00:27:54.200 --> 00:27:57.320
And then I lost my shit yelling about millennials for whatever reason,

465
00:27:57.380 --> 00:28:01.910
as if they're already running hearts.
My apologies to millennials.
Okay.

466
00:28:02.840 --> 00:28:04.550
You guys,
she just like hipsters.
Okay.

467
00:28:04.940 --> 00:28:07.340
You're getting way more shit than you deserve.
You're not all bad.

468
00:28:08.170 --> 00:28:11.300
<v 2>All right.
So</v>

469
00:28:12.630 --> 00:28:15.810
<v 1>I fucking,
and then I yelled at the,
I yelled at the fucking</v>

470
00:28:16.890 --> 00:28:17.930
<v 2>car seat guy.</v>

471
00:28:20.260 --> 00:28:24.220
<v 1>You know who now I don't believe his mood.
I think it was all just a tactic.
Hey,</v>

472
00:28:24.221 --> 00:28:27.520
how are you?
Absolutely.
Here's your kid's seat.
Go Fuck Yourself.

473
00:28:27.970 --> 00:28:32.230
That was his vibe.
Um,
legally go fuck yourself.

474
00:28:32.500 --> 00:28:36.820
So,
uh,
any wish I,
um,

475
00:28:38.930 --> 00:28:42.530
I finally find where my laugh is we bring all the bags out,

476
00:28:42.531 --> 00:28:46.910
we stick everything in,
and then I go to get on the Ted Williams tunnel,

477
00:28:47.000 --> 00:28:50.270
which really is,
it really should have been

478
00:28:52.010 --> 00:28:53.810
in an episode of the Dukes of Hazzard.

479
00:28:53.811 --> 00:28:57.080
If they reboot the dukes of Hazzard as they're rebooting every fucking show.

480
00:28:59.000 --> 00:28:59.710
<v 2>MMM.</v>

481
00:28:59.710 --> 00:29:02.020
<v 1>The amount of a fuck over that.
The big dig was</v>

482
00:29:04.130 --> 00:29:07.850
the fucking Ted Williams tunnel starts off.
It's four lanes across like,
wow,

483
00:29:07.910 --> 00:29:10.160
this is great.
Then it goes down to three,

484
00:29:10.340 --> 00:29:14.300
then it goes down to two who builds a fucking two laned fucking

485
00:29:16.450 --> 00:29:17.283
<v 2>tunnel.</v>

486
00:29:18.800 --> 00:29:21.290
<v 1>Then the last 2030 years,
who the fuck has done that?</v>

487
00:29:22.850 --> 00:29:24.530
Like the entire big dig is,

488
00:29:24.560 --> 00:29:29.300
it's like two fucking lanes that goes down to one lane or it's three down at the

489
00:29:29.301 --> 00:29:32.390
whole fucking thing.
It's just everybody merging underground.

490
00:29:32.710 --> 00:29:36.900
It is an absolutely fucking hellish traffic.

491
00:29:40.050 --> 00:29:43.450
And all I could picture was all the people that scammed it,

492
00:29:43.930 --> 00:29:48.100
living in giant houses with their own fucking helicopter flying over all of it,

493
00:29:48.101 --> 00:29:52.240
not giving a shit,
which I'm sure is not true,
but in my head,
that all make sense.

494
00:29:52.690 --> 00:29:57.550
So I ended up missing my turn when I came out of the tunnel because uh,
you know,

495
00:29:57.551 --> 00:29:59.530
I'm in the tunnel,
my gps didn't work.

496
00:30:00.610 --> 00:30:05.610
And so you actually get on the mass pike and their signage is so bad.

497
00:30:06.340 --> 00:30:07.420
There's actually an exit.

498
00:30:07.421 --> 00:30:11.740
You can get off work with all this signage on how to make a u turn to drive back

499
00:30:11.741 --> 00:30:16.430
to the fucking exit that they know that you missed.
But this,

500
00:30:16.431 --> 00:30:18.860
but they pocketed all the money for all this signage.

501
00:30:18.861 --> 00:30:23.060
They should have fucking had to just have one fucking sign,

502
00:30:23.420 --> 00:30:25.340
which is the u turn to send you back in.

503
00:30:27.240 --> 00:30:32.240
Which is why everybody in Boston is so goddamn funny because they do shit like

504
00:30:32.731 --> 00:30:37.230
that.
Laugh about it and pocket the money and then everybody else is having an

505
00:30:37.231 --> 00:30:38.640
absolute shit fit,

506
00:30:38.910 --> 00:30:42.690
flipping out saying hilarious stuff about millennials or God knows what.

507
00:30:44.340 --> 00:30:46.800
Um,
I think I finally figured it out where they go.

508
00:30:46.801 --> 00:30:49.710
Why are they so many fucking funny comedians that come out of Boston?

509
00:30:49.820 --> 00:30:52.170
I would say because of the lack of signage.

510
00:30:53.010 --> 00:30:55.650
It just keeps you in this.

511
00:30:56.580 --> 00:30:56.770
<v 0>Yeah.</v>

512
00:30:56.770 --> 00:31:01.330
<v 1>Planes,
trains and automobile mode.
12 months out of the fucking year.</v>

513
00:31:02.800 --> 00:31:06.040
Everybody in Boston,
you know how they,
you know,
they know how to get to work.

514
00:31:06.280 --> 00:31:09.040
Not because of the signs,
because they memorized it.

515
00:31:10.120 --> 00:31:12.400
Everybody's going on fucking memory out here.

516
00:31:12.401 --> 00:31:14.380
It's certainly not the fucking signs.
All right.

517
00:31:14.381 --> 00:31:16.720
I think that made my goddamned point.
Let me do a little,
uh,

518
00:31:17.350 --> 00:31:21.430
a little reading here.
But anyways,
we're here at the hotel.

519
00:31:21.760 --> 00:31:24.100
Everything's good.
I actually worked out yesterday.

520
00:31:24.340 --> 00:31:28.840
I'm going to try to stay on my diet and like pick my spots where I'm going to be

521
00:31:28.841 --> 00:31:32.920
a,
or I'm going to be eaten bad,
but um,

522
00:31:33.640 --> 00:31:36.010
whatever.
I don't have anything planned.

523
00:31:36.040 --> 00:31:38.410
I just want to hang with family and friends.
It's gonna be great.

524
00:31:38.830 --> 00:31:42.010
And you know what's awesome about having the kid is there's no,

525
00:31:42.730 --> 00:31:45.400
no one gives a shit about you anymore.
It's perfect.

526
00:31:45.820 --> 00:31:48.700
You kid is to start with the show.
You just come walking in.
Hey Bill,

527
00:31:48.830 --> 00:31:52.510
how you doing?
Great.
You look at my kid.
Is My kid cute.
Oh my God.

528
00:31:52.540 --> 00:31:54.460
Look at those cheeks.
It's over.

529
00:31:55.420 --> 00:31:59.800
You just get to stand in the background sipping a drink.

530
00:32:01.640 --> 00:32:04.580
Hello.
By the way,
you know my wife's giving me pressure.
She's like,
pill.

531
00:32:04.581 --> 00:32:06.350
You're going to stay sober this whole fucking trip.

532
00:32:07.130 --> 00:32:09.520
I can't go down to the hotel bar.
I'm a down the hotel bar.

533
00:32:09.550 --> 00:32:11.580
I'll just get a little silicon and fucking the,

534
00:32:13.340 --> 00:32:15.170
maybe call it a fucking soda or some shit.

535
00:32:15.750 --> 00:32:17.960
What is that fucking drink that people order?

536
00:32:20.100 --> 00:32:22.530
Can I get a a a club soda in a line.
There you go.

537
00:32:22.531 --> 00:32:23.850
I'm getting it done and get it done.
Okay.

538
00:32:24.360 --> 00:32:28.860
Draftkings everybody fantasy football season is coming to a close.

539
00:32:29.340 --> 00:32:31.230
It's time for the Tony Awards.

540
00:32:31.231 --> 00:32:34.890
Everyone and the sadness is really starting to set in.

541
00:32:36.270 --> 00:32:38.320
Um,
how about just the football season is ending.

542
00:32:38.800 --> 00:32:41.810
There's a word for your suffering,
seasoned itis.

543
00:32:42.810 --> 00:32:46.110
But while your season long league might be done,

544
00:32:46.140 --> 00:32:51.060
it's not too late to draft a new team and win money doing it with one week

545
00:32:51.061 --> 00:32:54.960
fantasy football at draftkings.
At draftkings,

546
00:32:55.200 --> 00:32:56.730
there are so many ways to play.

547
00:32:57.150 --> 00:33:01.620
Choose from public contests with huge cash prizes or private contests where you

548
00:33:01.621 --> 00:33:06.621
can compete against your friends there even they even got beginner and casual

549
00:33:06.751 --> 00:33:10.740
contest where you play against people of a similar skill level.
The best part,

550
00:33:11.550 --> 00:33:12.240
you don't have to.

551
00:33:12.240 --> 00:33:16.860
I'm actually going to do this because I am ashamed at how few people's names I

552
00:33:16.861 --> 00:33:20.260
know in the league.
I just wish I could order all,
you know,

553
00:33:20.300 --> 00:33:22.770
the a complete set of football cards for the season.

554
00:33:22.771 --> 00:33:25.200
I can look at him like flashcards when I did as a kid,

555
00:33:25.620 --> 00:33:28.920
but my last time I tried to collect football cards in the two thousands.

556
00:33:29.190 --> 00:33:33.120
It was only adults doing it,
so they would deliberately trying to make them rare.

557
00:33:34.620 --> 00:33:36.090
Anyways.
Uh,

558
00:33:36.091 --> 00:33:40.320
the best part is you get to draft a new team each week and drafting a team is

559
00:33:40.321 --> 00:33:43.860
arguably the best part of fantasy aside from winning cache.

560
00:33:44.070 --> 00:33:48.600
That is just,
that is,
okay.
Sorry.
Just as Travis from Los Angeles,

561
00:33:48.601 --> 00:33:53.601
he turned a $300 entry into 1000 bucks or Gary from Houston who turned his $3

562
00:33:53.760 --> 00:33:56.480
entry into 50 grand dod.

563
00:33:56.540 --> 00:33:58.850
You must've had a fucking 10 teen Pilate,

564
00:33:59.100 --> 00:34:03.590
huge cash prizes and bragging rights awake only at draftkings.

565
00:34:05.930 --> 00:34:08.500
Why the fuck do I get credit for that?
If there's no god damn link,

566
00:34:08.501 --> 00:34:12.520
I was going to go there,
click on the microphone and add my name burn.

567
00:34:13.540 --> 00:34:16.660
They don't even tell me to do that.
Maybe only have got to half the copy.
I Dunno.

568
00:34:17.860 --> 00:34:21.280
So that's it.
People,
that's all I got.
I got one read,

569
00:34:22.540 --> 00:34:26.740
you know,
I'm down to like one advertiser now.

570
00:34:26.770 --> 00:34:30.880
Whatever I ever did this to make money I did to make my tie my gigs to make

571
00:34:30.881 --> 00:34:33.790
money.
So whatever,
whatever the fuck.
I'm not changing my style.
Okay.

572
00:34:34.660 --> 00:34:38.800
These people don't like me fucking bringing up the clan every once in a while

573
00:34:38.801 --> 00:34:43.750
during a fucking read.
What am I supposed to do?
My supposed to be like,

574
00:34:44.410 --> 00:34:49.000
like that time Russia decided to jump on the hip hop wagon and make a fucking

575
00:34:49.001 --> 00:34:53.110
rap song.
Is that what I'm supposed to do?
How did that work out for those guys?

576
00:34:55.100 --> 00:34:57.200
You know,
somebody was trying to tell me that Neil pure,

577
00:34:57.620 --> 00:35:00.680
the reason that he retires because his body hurts so much from all those years

578
00:35:00.681 --> 00:35:03.430
of playing.
And uh,

579
00:35:03.670 --> 00:35:07.850
that actually really made me sad and I was thinking like,
man,
that guy,
that guy,

580
00:35:08.000 --> 00:35:11.930
what he needs to do is just get a fucking really good misuse.

581
00:35:13.310 --> 00:35:17.670
He must have one though.
I don't know.
You gotta get a jet.

582
00:35:17.671 --> 00:35:21.310
I level misuse Seuss.
I swear to God.

583
00:35:21.370 --> 00:35:26.000
Like the woman that I go to right now is working on my calves,

584
00:35:26.180 --> 00:35:29.720
which had been glued up for like almost 50 years at this point.

585
00:35:29.780 --> 00:35:33.500
I don't know what she's doing,
but she just takes like two fingers,
right?

586
00:35:33.740 --> 00:35:35.960
And it just fucking presses against my calves.

587
00:35:35.990 --> 00:35:40.660
It feels like I have a ball of Hornets in my fucking cat.

588
00:35:40.690 --> 00:35:42.790
I wish you guys could see me in this thing.

589
00:35:43.510 --> 00:35:48.380
I'm just coming up off the table like a fucking mirror kiss America.

590
00:35:48.480 --> 00:35:51.730
Imagine a mere cat that's bald,
screaming in pain.

591
00:35:52.970 --> 00:35:56.460
I just go,
I'll be like,
ah,
fucking cock suck.

592
00:36:01.120 --> 00:36:05.360
And I'm not an athlete.
We all know this.
I do stand up comedy.

593
00:36:05.390 --> 00:36:10.100
I can't have now I get why professional athletes like every week this sitting in

594
00:36:10.101 --> 00:36:12.020
a tub of ice,
they're always get new,

595
00:36:12.021 --> 00:36:16.370
fucking massaged and all of that cause a bodies is so god damn fucked up.

596
00:36:16.400 --> 00:36:18.260
I feel like my body was like

597
00:36:20.060 --> 00:36:23.270
how bad it got was PR,
which is why I have all of these injuries.

598
00:36:23.390 --> 00:36:27.610
He's out of nowhere,
you know?
And I'm now down to one injury,

599
00:36:27.640 --> 00:36:29.200
my fucking rotator cuff,

600
00:36:29.201 --> 00:36:34.201
which I can't seem to get it to heal because I don't have the fucking patients.

601
00:36:35.950 --> 00:36:38.890
And I miss playing drums too much and I just start,

602
00:36:38.950 --> 00:36:42.430
I sit down and play and then I do something else to fuck it up again.

603
00:36:42.431 --> 00:36:44.530
I'm such an idiot.
Um,

604
00:36:46.110 --> 00:36:46.170
<v 2>okay.</v>

605
00:36:46.170 --> 00:36:47.003
<v 1>But anyways,</v>

606
00:36:48.000 --> 00:36:48.690
<v 2>yeah,</v>

607
00:36:48.690 --> 00:36:51.270
<v 1>I dunno.
Maybe cause I'm a fan or whatever.</v>

608
00:36:51.271 --> 00:36:56.271
I just hope that he finds a really good fucking like a Jedi level Miss Susur in

609
00:36:56.821 --> 00:37:00.360
a good chiropractor and he takes a couple of years off and then he comes back.

610
00:37:01.390 --> 00:37:05.790
Uh,
but a bad,
bad,
bad,
bad.
Got a damn.
Um,
anyway,
speaking of music,

611
00:37:06.540 --> 00:37:09.870
a uh,
a good friend of mine,
you know,
is there anything,

612
00:37:10.190 --> 00:37:12.870
should your friend ever a better friend than when they tell you about a new

613
00:37:12.871 --> 00:37:15.270
fucking band that you end up loving?
Um,

614
00:37:15.390 --> 00:37:16.890
I don't know what the name of the drummer is.

615
00:37:16.891 --> 00:37:20.640
I Dunno if the name of the band is the name of the guy who's actually the

616
00:37:20.641 --> 00:37:25.070
drummer.
I don't know.
But there's this band or this guy,
uh,

617
00:37:25.080 --> 00:37:30.080
Yussef Kamaal and the name of the album is black focus and it's spelled y u.

618
00:37:33.960 --> 00:37:37.830
S.
S.
E.
F.
Komal is k a.
M.
A.
L.
All right,

619
00:37:39.660 --> 00:37:42.810
dude.
I got to tell you,
the drumming,
the music,

620
00:37:42.900 --> 00:37:46.740
first of all and the band is incredible,
but the drumming on this album,

621
00:37:48.110 --> 00:37:52.880
the best way to describe it would be like if you could somehow merge

622
00:37:54.420 --> 00:37:57.930
like a quest love type of player with Tony Williams.

623
00:38:00.150 --> 00:38:00.983
<v 2>MMM.</v>

624
00:38:02.120 --> 00:38:02.660
<v 1>It's like that.</v>

625
00:38:02.660 --> 00:38:07.660
Breakbeat fucking James Brown quest love tight drumming,

626
00:38:11.470 --> 00:38:14.800
uh,
with like that Tony Williams vibe,

627
00:38:14.950 --> 00:38:19.270
even as like the black dot heads on his toms that has a little bit of that
sound.

628
00:38:20.050 --> 00:38:23.700
It's fucking incredible.
Um,
and there's,

629
00:38:23.730 --> 00:38:27.300
you got to listen to the album isn't enough.
Um,

630
00:38:27.930 --> 00:38:30.360
I actually tweeted out a link to one,
two,

631
00:38:30.361 --> 00:38:34.620
like the band playing live and the person,
thank God filming it was for once,

632
00:38:34.621 --> 00:38:38.800
just on the drummer from the side.
And this guy is like,

633
00:38:40.280 --> 00:38:44.090
he's one of those guys that it's just like he's playing from his spirit.

634
00:38:44.120 --> 00:38:48.860
You know,
he's like in a trance when he's fucking playing.
He's unbelievable.
And,

635
00:38:49.190 --> 00:38:51.440
uh,
I went online to see if they were going to be in the states.

636
00:38:51.441 --> 00:38:54.650
They seem to be over in Europe right now,
but,
uh,

637
00:38:54.651 --> 00:38:58.580
I will cancel a fucking Gig to go see that band.
That's how good they are.
Yousef,

638
00:38:58.990 --> 00:39:02.930
Kamala,
the name of the album is black focus.
Check it out if you get a chance.
Uh,

639
00:39:02.931 --> 00:39:06.080
what are we up to here?
Oh,
39 minutes and I'll look at that.
It's Christmas.

640
00:39:06.170 --> 00:39:09.500
I'm giving you some extra time here.
Uh,
the Bruins,
by the way,
ruins,
by the way,

641
00:39:09.501 --> 00:39:12.110
I've got a two game win streak,
I believe,

642
00:39:12.111 --> 00:39:13.970
and there's six and three in the month of December.

643
00:39:13.971 --> 00:39:16.400
I finally have a chance to at least watch some of the highlights.

644
00:39:16.490 --> 00:39:21.490
I've been so busy and a happy 20th birthday that shall we McAvoy who had his

645
00:39:22.221 --> 00:39:24.650
first Gordie Howe hack trick the other night.

646
00:39:24.651 --> 00:39:26.060
And for those who don't watch hockey,

647
00:39:26.061 --> 00:39:30.200
a Gordie Howe hat trick is a goal and an assist in a fight.

648
00:39:30.950 --> 00:39:31.880
He had his first fight.

649
00:39:32.470 --> 00:39:33.303
<v 2>MMM.</v>

650
00:39:33.780 --> 00:39:35.460
<v 1>I would love to interview somebody.</v>

651
00:39:37.200 --> 00:39:38.033
<v 2>MMM.</v>

652
00:39:38.330 --> 00:39:40.670
<v 1>Like a Charlie McAvoy where he's not a goon,</v>

653
00:39:41.360 --> 00:39:45.220
but like I would love to interview them as far as like,

654
00:39:45.370 --> 00:39:47.750
cause he came up playing hockey.

655
00:39:47.751 --> 00:39:49.790
I don't think he played in any league where you could fight.

656
00:39:50.780 --> 00:39:55.010
So this was his first and he came right straight from bu last year in like march

657
00:39:55.130 --> 00:39:59.620
or April and had an immediate impact.
Um,
so I think I'm,

658
00:39:59.740 --> 00:40:04.010
I'm wondering if this was his first hockey fight period and like what is going

659
00:40:04.011 --> 00:40:07.370
through your head when you go to drop the gloves?
Like,

660
00:40:09.740 --> 00:40:11.510
and you're fighting on in Nhl love.
I mean,

661
00:40:11.511 --> 00:40:15.560
fighting somebody alone is brutal now because someone's going to have this cell

662
00:40:15.561 --> 00:40:16.161
phone camera,

663
00:40:16.161 --> 00:40:19.460
but to actually do it on television and it takes a lot of fucking balls.

664
00:40:20.740 --> 00:40:21.573
<v 2>MMM.</v>

665
00:40:21.920 --> 00:40:26.030
<v 1>I always wondered like what's going through their head and fighting on skates.</v>

666
00:40:26.060 --> 00:40:29.750
It's the only way to learn how to do it is to do it.
It's like stand up comedy.

667
00:40:29.751 --> 00:40:33.230
Like you could stand in your room and fucking rehearse in front of a mirror,

668
00:40:33.231 --> 00:40:36.090
but it's,
it's all out the window.
The second you get on stage,

669
00:40:36.760 --> 00:40:40.500
it's like guitar where you could practice,
you know,

670
00:40:40.501 --> 00:40:42.490
and rehearse with the band and all of that shit.

671
00:40:42.520 --> 00:40:45.040
Even then you're just going to be that extra level of nervousness because now

672
00:40:45.041 --> 00:40:46.000
people are watching you.

673
00:40:47.460 --> 00:40:48.293
<v 2>MMM.</v>

674
00:40:48.980 --> 00:40:51.200
<v 1>That's my favorite thing about all of that stuff.
Like</v>

675
00:40:53.090 --> 00:40:53.923
<v 2>mmm.</v>

676
00:40:54.090 --> 00:40:59.090
<v 1>Doing any sort of acting in front of a crowd and all of that is just our plain,</v>

677
00:41:00.121 --> 00:41:02.940
you know,
rehearsing with the band and then playing in front of them.

678
00:41:03.060 --> 00:41:07.210
I always loved that,
that rush of,
you know,

679
00:41:07.840 --> 00:41:11.740
when you look at each other before you start is that like,
oh here it is,

680
00:41:12.370 --> 00:41:17.040
all of that work.
Now here it is,
is this,
we're going to pull this off,

681
00:41:17.041 --> 00:41:19.320
are we going to shit the bed or whatever.

682
00:41:19.900 --> 00:41:22.120
And there's always that part that's the difficult part.

683
00:41:22.180 --> 00:41:24.160
And you know where you've got like a lot of lines or like this,

684
00:41:24.170 --> 00:41:28.020
some sort of drum fill and when you get on the other side of it and hopefully

685
00:41:28.021 --> 00:41:30.870
pulled it off,
you're like,
oh,
it's all downhill.

686
00:41:30.900 --> 00:41:32.400
And then you relax and then you fuck up.

687
00:41:34.200 --> 00:41:38.150
I don't mean relaxed in a good way,
I should probably say loose focus.

688
00:41:39.230 --> 00:41:43.970
Um,
and by the way,
that's something that I've been working on,
um,

689
00:41:44.540 --> 00:41:49.370
with my,
my drumming is,
my teacher has been telling me forever.

690
00:41:49.380 --> 00:41:54.380
He just basically to sum up what he says is 15 minutes a day of focused

691
00:41:56.421 --> 00:41:59.030
practice.
See if I remember this,

692
00:41:59.031 --> 00:42:03.980
15 minutes a day of focused practice is better than four hours of add playing,

693
00:42:04.520 --> 00:42:09.090
which is what I would do.
Good Times,
bad times for a minute.
Oh,
uh,
uh,

694
00:42:09.110 --> 00:42:12.080
tower power Squibb cakes.
Let me work on that for fucking two minutes.

695
00:42:12.320 --> 00:42:15.260
Let me do this and blah,
blah blah.
And you just all over the fucking map.

696
00:42:16.120 --> 00:42:20.270
It'd be literally like if you're trying to learn to speak another language and

697
00:42:20.300 --> 00:42:20.810
rather than,

698
00:42:20.810 --> 00:42:25.810
than just trying to learn a phrase or two a day and then sticking with that for

699
00:42:26.631 --> 00:42:26.901
a week.

700
00:42:26.901 --> 00:42:31.220
So it becomes part of something that you could just pull up immediately as you

701
00:42:31.221 --> 00:42:36.221
think you would try to learn like 50 words a day and then the next day do 50

702
00:42:36.771 --> 00:42:39.110
different words.
Um,

703
00:42:40.280 --> 00:42:43.820
so I've really been working on,
on that and um,

704
00:42:46.140 --> 00:42:51.140
and all I've been doing is just like a doubles working on just a double stroke

705
00:42:52.441 --> 00:42:53.790
roll with accents.

706
00:42:53.880 --> 00:42:57.270
And I've been working on that since fucking November and all of a sudden

707
00:42:57.300 --> 00:43:00.810
something clicked.
And,
uh,

708
00:43:02.180 --> 00:43:07.080
I,
I'm just,
I'm finally so fucking excited that,

709
00:43:07.380 --> 00:43:12.180
uh,
that I've been able to do that.
So,
so if you're out there,

710
00:43:13.230 --> 00:43:17.160
man,
woman,
transgendered person,
whatever drummer you are,

711
00:43:18.630 --> 00:43:20.220
uh,
you know,

712
00:43:20.370 --> 00:43:24.450
most creative people have massive levels of fucking add.

713
00:43:26.190 --> 00:43:29.490
Um,
and it's not because you're stupid,
it's not because you lack focus.
He's just,

714
00:43:29.491 --> 00:43:34.200
you have a very creative brain and you think of something which makes you think

715
00:43:34.201 --> 00:43:37.050
of the next idea and the next idea and the next idea.

716
00:43:37.410 --> 00:43:42.060
And practicing is not creating,
it's working on an idea that you have,

717
00:43:42.960 --> 00:43:47.090
if that makes sense.
If you just work on that,
and I,

718
00:43:47.250 --> 00:43:50.730
in my 15 minutes,
like I'll be playing doubles,
right?

719
00:43:51.210 --> 00:43:52.470
And then all of a sudden I'll be like,
oh,

720
00:43:52.471 --> 00:43:55.980
let's throw some paradiddles and a big bill bill back to the doubles.

721
00:43:56.070 --> 00:44:01.070
He just had to keep like hitting the reset button and,

722
00:44:01.710 --> 00:44:03.980
um,
that alone,

723
00:44:04.010 --> 00:44:08.900
like I had to practice out of focus as fucked up as that sounds.
But you know,

724
00:44:08.901 --> 00:44:13.130
if you work on it a little bit every day,
um,
you know,

725
00:44:13.580 --> 00:44:17.810
cause I figured if I could fucking do it to my lack of musical ability,

726
00:44:17.811 --> 00:44:19.700
if musicians who listen to this,

727
00:44:19.701 --> 00:44:24.080
if you actually fucking try that on any instrument or whatever,
I'm telling you,

728
00:44:25.520 --> 00:44:29.580
um,
you'll start to see results.
It's fucking awesome.

729
00:44:30.530 --> 00:44:34.650
Um,
that you can apply the playing.
It's fucking amazing.
So anyways,
um,

730
00:44:34.710 --> 00:44:38.340
the Celtics were the bro Burns today have Winnipeg,

731
00:44:38.341 --> 00:44:43.341
and then on Saturday they have the red wings and then the Celtics have the bowls

732
00:44:44.040 --> 00:44:47.010
that night.
All right.
And back in the day before I was a dad,

733
00:44:47.011 --> 00:44:49.950
I would have gone to both games a little Bingo.

734
00:44:50.550 --> 00:44:53.790
Banga and I carry my buzz from the Bruins game right into the Celtics.

735
00:44:55.070 --> 00:44:57.620
<v 2>Um,
but,
uh,</v>

736
00:44:58.300 --> 00:45:01.510
<v 1>I'm a dad now,
so I can't fucking do that switch means I'll watch the game.</v>

737
00:45:01.511 --> 00:45:03.970
But I am going,
I'm going to the Celtics bowls.
I am doing that.

738
00:45:05.200 --> 00:45:06.033
<v 2>MMM.
[inaudible]</v>

739
00:45:06.630 --> 00:45:06.640
<v 1>chicken,</v>

740
00:45:06.640 --> 00:45:11.380
a couple of family members there for a little Christmas celebration there.

741
00:45:11.920 --> 00:45:12.970
Um,
I know it's just the bowls,

742
00:45:12.971 --> 00:45:15.670
but the next time they plays on Christmas Day and that's not going to work out.

743
00:45:15.750 --> 00:45:20.350
All right.
My stomach's growling here.
I got to go get somebody.
All right.
Uh,

744
00:45:20.380 --> 00:45:25.200
merry Christmas to everybody.
Happy Hanukkah,
appy,
Kwanzaa,
happy.
Uh,

745
00:45:25.240 --> 00:45:28.930
I don't celebrate the holidays to you.
Whatever it is.
A Hey,
you made it.

746
00:45:29.080 --> 00:45:33.730
You made it to 2017,
2018.
It's going to be even better for you.
All right?
Uh,

747
00:45:33.760 --> 00:45:35.410
go fuck yourselves.
Have a great weekend.

748
00:45:35.540 --> 00:45:38.290
You'd cuts and I will talk to you on Monday,

749
00:45:38.590 --> 00:45:43.240
hopefully about another Patriot victory over the buffalo bills.
All right,

750
00:45:43.640 --> 00:45:44.473
see you.

751
00:46:27.840 --> 00:46:28.673

<v 7>the one</v>

December 21st,</v>

755
00:47:05.870 --> 00:47:09.920
2000.
Who will die?
What's going on?
How the hell are you?

756
00:47:10.130 --> 00:47:13.610
How are you last week?
Did you miss me?
Um,

757
00:47:13.611 --> 00:47:17.210
I actually was surprised how many emails I got were people like,
do what happens?

758
00:47:17.360 --> 00:47:21.740
You'll fucking die.
Just making sure you're all right.
You know,

759
00:47:22.910 --> 00:47:27.320
fucking Brittany Murphy died.
You know,
did you die?

760
00:47:27.740 --> 00:47:30.350
I felt really bad about that.
You know,
if you've known,

761
00:47:30.351 --> 00:47:31.780
I never saw any of her movies,
but you know,

762
00:47:31.781 --> 00:47:36.190
if I felt as bad as you feel when somebody you don't know dies,
you know,

763
00:47:37.000 --> 00:47:39.850
I hate when people try to get light when they get overly sad about somebody

764
00:47:39.851 --> 00:47:41.980
famous dying because you know,

765
00:47:41.981 --> 00:47:45.400
you never met them and then they try to use it as an excuse to get out of

766
00:47:45.401 --> 00:47:48.190
working.
No,
you don't understand.

767
00:47:48.191 --> 00:47:52.660
I used to watch clueless with my mother.
We watch to like every day I just,

768
00:47:52.661 --> 00:47:55.480
I can't function right now.
Shut up.

769
00:47:56.410 --> 00:48:01.410
You fucking Lazy Twat go in there and do your end of the year bullshit so we can

770
00:48:01.691 --> 00:48:06.220
get on with the fucking Christmas party.
You know,

771
00:48:06.730 --> 00:48:10.630
you didn't know her.
Okay.
You didn't know her.

772
00:48:11.020 --> 00:48:15.460
I didn't know or nobody knows her.
Well,
people know are,
but nobody,
we know.

773
00:48:15.640 --> 00:48:20.180
You fucking idiot.
Just do your fucking job.
Um hmm.

774
00:48:20.390 --> 00:48:22.130
Wow.
Little intense there.
Um,

775
00:48:22.180 --> 00:48:27.100
basically I didn't do a special last week because,
um,

776
00:48:27.101 --> 00:48:30.520
I was under the weather and as you can tell,
I'm still getting over it.

777
00:48:30.550 --> 00:48:34.120
I have the,
uh,
and I think I have the swine flu,

778
00:48:38.890 --> 00:48:42.370
you know,
a little of that little that going on.
I just say the Christmas cookie,

779
00:48:42.910 --> 00:48:46.960
I made a Christmas cookie.
Did you make a Christmas cookie?
You're forgiven fair.

780
00:48:47.020 --> 00:48:47.950
Yes I did.

781
00:48:48.310 --> 00:48:53.140
I keep the holiday traditions alive in my house.
You know,

782
00:48:53.141 --> 00:48:55.240
I don't go home for the holidays anymore.
And you know what?

783
00:48:55.241 --> 00:48:56.770
I bet a lot of you are wishing you don't.

784
00:48:56.800 --> 00:48:58.840
If you're stuck in an airport and if you are,

785
00:48:59.020 --> 00:49:02.830
I feel for you because I've been there and what you're going through right now

786
00:49:02.831 --> 00:49:07.330
is the exact fucking reason that I don't go home for the holidays other than the

787
00:49:07.331 --> 00:49:12.310
fact that I had to get on with my life here,
um,
is I'm telling you,

788
00:49:12.440 --> 00:49:14.020
and you go anywhere where it,

789
00:49:14.021 --> 00:49:19.000
even remotes remotely has a snowflake and the day you're going to travel,

790
00:49:19.390 --> 00:49:24.010
God knows there's going to be four inches of fucking snow and the weathermen are

791
00:49:24.011 --> 00:49:28.420
going to act like it's going to be 40 feet of snow.
You know,

792
00:49:28.480 --> 00:49:29.221
that's one thing I,
I've,

793
00:49:29.221 --> 00:49:34.221
I've noticed in my lifetime where somehow weather has become like an action

794
00:49:36.791 --> 00:49:41.230
movie,
you know,
and they cats my girlfriend leaving,
closing the squeaky door,

795
00:49:42.100 --> 00:49:46.510
no concern for the recording.
Um,

796
00:49:47.390 --> 00:49:52.090
you know,
broad [inaudible] they're going to do what they want to do,
you know?
Um,

797
00:49:52.091 --> 00:49:56.470
so anyways,
yeah,
but back in the day there was four inches of snow.
That was it.

798
00:49:57.760 --> 00:50:02.050
It was,
it's gonna snow on Thursday.
It wasn't like,

799
00:50:02.051 --> 00:50:04.950
oh my God,
Angie vaccines,
none your,

800
00:50:05.140 --> 00:50:07.780
they always fucking scare the shit out of old people.
Right.
And they fucking,

801
00:50:07.781 --> 00:50:10.090
you know,
those idiots,

802
00:50:11.440 --> 00:50:14.740
it's like four inches of snow and people going down on the supermarket like

803
00:50:14.741 --> 00:50:19.240
buying provisions,
you know,
gun powder and bread and shit.
It's like,

804
00:50:19.241 --> 00:50:23.620
it's four inches of fucking snow.
You know,

805
00:50:23.621 --> 00:50:26.920
what is the worst case scenario?
The scenario,
right?
What is it?

806
00:50:28.370 --> 00:50:32.600
Four inches of snow,
even for a little old lady is up to your ankles.

807
00:50:33.530 --> 00:50:38.270
Okay.
If you have a problem,
people can get to you.
You know,

808
00:50:39.500 --> 00:50:43.550
even if there was a foot of snow,
which is a lot of fucking snow.
Okay.

809
00:50:44.270 --> 00:50:46.520
And let's just say you didn't have any food,

810
00:50:47.720 --> 00:50:52.250
you can still just take a handful of fucking snow,
stick it in the glass,

811
00:50:52.490 --> 00:50:53.450
let it melt,

812
00:50:54.560 --> 00:50:57.560
and then let it cool down so you don't get a fucking snow cone headache.

813
00:50:57.561 --> 00:51:01.400
And then you have water and you can live for a long time on just water.

814
00:51:01.880 --> 00:51:05.180
It's only a foot of snow.
These fucking assholes.

815
00:51:05.181 --> 00:51:08.270
They scare the shit out of people.
So,
uh,

816
00:51:08.271 --> 00:51:11.420
I don't know what this has to do with people being stranding and stranded in an

817
00:51:11.421 --> 00:51:14.870
airport.
All I can say is I'm so site,
I'm not one of those people.

818
00:51:16.460 --> 00:51:20.180
Um,
but anyways,
getting back to me,
um,

819
00:51:20.300 --> 00:51:24.770
last week I did my,
uh,
my,
my latest standup special,
uh,

820
00:51:24.800 --> 00:51:29.030
let it go and I did it at the a,
the Fillmore in San Francisco,

821
00:51:29.031 --> 00:51:32.120
the original Fillmore.
And right now you should be going,
well,

822
00:51:32.121 --> 00:51:35.540
what do you mean you original film?
Or what does that mean?
Uh,

823
00:51:35.541 --> 00:51:38.320
I thought that that was the Fillmore west,
but evidently it is.

824
00:51:38.480 --> 00:51:41.990
And it's the Fillmore auditorium where I think they were there from like,

825
00:51:41.991 --> 00:51:43.910
I don't know,
65 to 68.

826
00:51:44.270 --> 00:51:48.290
And then 68 they moved down to market street and that became the Fillmore West.

827
00:51:48.470 --> 00:51:51.500
That's where Zeppelin and I think the WHO and all those guys played.

828
00:51:51.920 --> 00:51:55.760
So I was a little disappointed when I played the Fillmore and realized that when

829
00:51:55.761 --> 00:51:57.350
I went into the green room bathroom,

830
00:51:57.351 --> 00:52:00.620
I wasn't actually urinating in a place where John Bonam took a shit.

831
00:52:00.980 --> 00:52:05.090
I was a little disappointed with that.
But um,

832
00:52:06.440 --> 00:52:10.010
my girlfriend is wearing some sort of fervor vest.

833
00:52:11.330 --> 00:52:12.260
What is that?

834
00:52:14.210 --> 00:52:17.060
What old lady died and then you bought that.

835
00:52:17.090 --> 00:52:19.430
Is that like a state jewelry acceptance of vest?

836
00:52:21.050 --> 00:52:25.250
Does that make any sense?
You're little Cruella Deville Ensemble.

837
00:52:26.540 --> 00:52:29.340
I'm your desk.
You're dressed very sensibly.
I can see why you put it on.

838
00:52:29.600 --> 00:52:32.810
Then you put it on the little first thing to add a little little edge to you.

839
00:52:33.860 --> 00:52:38.360
So people be like,
you know,
he didn't want to be plain Jane during the holidays.

840
00:52:41.480 --> 00:52:44.930
No,
I hate those fucking shoes with a passion.

841
00:52:45.770 --> 00:52:48.860
If you always,
if you ever,
if you wore those shoes on the first date,

842
00:52:48.861 --> 00:52:53.530
there never would have met a second day
rally.
You can think of the,

843
00:52:53.770 --> 00:52:57.320
add those things in fucking,
she's got these Bruce shot up,

844
00:52:57.321 --> 00:53:01.430
she's got these Bruce Lee Karate fucking flats.

845
00:53:03.020 --> 00:53:07.840
They're horrible.
They're ballet flats.
Well,

846
00:53:07.850 --> 00:53:08.750
what did that prove?

847
00:53:13.460 --> 00:53:17.650
All right,
get outta here.
Um,
Duh.

848
00:53:18.170 --> 00:53:20.930
Doesn't everybody just happen?
You know,
your girlfriend has that pair of shoes.

849
00:53:20.931 --> 00:53:25.230
You just fucking hate her comfortable shoes.
These are thug.
I like them.

850
00:53:25.231 --> 00:53:30.070
They're comfortable.
You know,
I swear to God and she left.

851
00:53:30.130 --> 00:53:35.110
You know,
it's fucking unbelievable is,
you know what's funny is when you hook up,

852
00:53:35.840 --> 00:53:38.470
you have a hookup with a short girl,
you know,

853
00:53:38.500 --> 00:53:41.020
and you see her in a Khaleesi or in the club,
right?

854
00:53:42.470 --> 00:53:46.820
And Your Dad sin,
right?
Don't worry,
I'm going to get to Jersey shore.

855
00:53:48.140 --> 00:53:51.470
Uh,
and you got like the fall.
Let's talk about that right now.

856
00:53:51.650 --> 00:53:55.410
Let's talk about that little sneaky girl.
Okay,

857
00:53:56.340 --> 00:53:57.060
let's just,

858
00:53:57.060 --> 00:54:01.500
let's just say she didn't have fucking triple f tidies.

859
00:54:01.890 --> 00:54:05.880
Let's just say she didn't have those and she was more proportioned.
Um,

860
00:54:05.881 --> 00:54:08.580
I'm actually convinced that she actually doesn't have a torso.

861
00:54:08.610 --> 00:54:13.470
She just has ass and titties and the ass or is at the same level as,

862
00:54:13.620 --> 00:54:16.020
as her titties,
um,
whatever.
You know,

863
00:54:16.080 --> 00:54:20.880
the short girls and they were like those four inch fucking heels and it just

864
00:54:20.881 --> 00:54:25.540
makes them,
their legs look unbelievable.
And you know,
I swear to God,

865
00:54:25.810 --> 00:54:29.800
you have to bang them in those shoes because when you get them out of the shoes,

866
00:54:30.250 --> 00:54:31.900
you just,
it's like

867
00:54:33.880 --> 00:54:37.270
they become like this little dwarf all of a sudden and they're walking around

868
00:54:37.390 --> 00:54:41.350
and they have that little thong on and you just,
it just,
it's fucking weird.

869
00:54:42.520 --> 00:54:45.760
You know what I'm saying is,
is,
you know,

870
00:54:46.300 --> 00:54:49.450
you meet a girl and you go out there and what are they dress up and then they're

871
00:54:49.451 --> 00:54:52.900
looking at their shoes.
Okay.
And they're like,
which shoes am I going to wear?

872
00:54:53.200 --> 00:54:56.860
I got to look sexy,
but I,
I can't make it look like,
you know,

873
00:54:56.920 --> 00:54:59.200
every time I see a dick,

874
00:54:59.201 --> 00:55:03.310
I'm diving on it like a war hero of dives on a fucking live grenade,
you know?

875
00:55:07.110 --> 00:55:11.800
Ah,
that's a fucking great image.
Just dive in on a fucking,

876
00:55:14.830 --> 00:55:18.820
Oh,
you filthy horse.
So they leave those shoes,
they leave those,

877
00:55:18.821 --> 00:55:23.500
I'm getting over my boyfriend shoes at home.
Right.
Um,

878
00:55:23.680 --> 00:55:27.140
that Kim could trails,
they leave those at home and that,
but they,
they date,

879
00:55:27.170 --> 00:55:31.180
they definitely,
you know,
they definitely sex the fucking thing.
I'm so whatever.

880
00:55:31.181 --> 00:55:31.991
Then they get you,
you know,

881
00:55:31.991 --> 00:55:35.740
you fall from whatever then in a relationship and then there's that one fucking

882
00:55:35.741 --> 00:55:39.700
day where they feel comfortable enough to wear their little comfortable shoes

883
00:55:40.330 --> 00:55:41.920
and they're just,
you know,

884
00:55:42.700 --> 00:55:47.700
toes and fucking and heal are just on the same legislative flats.

885
00:55:47.741 --> 00:55:52.480
They were their fucking flats and they're little stretch pants and all of a

886
00:55:52.481 --> 00:55:53.340
sudden you,

887
00:55:53.380 --> 00:55:57.730
it's like you're walking around with like this soccer mom and it's like,

888
00:55:57.731 --> 00:56:02.230
what happened in the fucking Hottie,
you know,
that I saw at work,

889
00:56:02.860 --> 00:56:05.200
right at work.
Listen to me,
I sound like Seinfeld

890
00:56:05.570 --> 00:56:08.340
<v 9>deal,
whether you're comfortable,</v>

891
00:56:10.140 --> 00:56:12.000
why aren't you drizzling?
Oh,

892
00:56:13.450 --> 00:56:15.730
<v 3>um,
yeah,
so those are hers.</v>

893
00:56:16.420 --> 00:56:19.330
She wears ballet flats and I swear to God,
you know,

894
00:56:19.420 --> 00:56:23.290
I know I bring up the leg sweep a lot,
but every time I see him,
I just,
you know,

895
00:56:24.130 --> 00:56:28.510
you ever been like in a store with your girlfriend and she's just annoying you

896
00:56:28.511 --> 00:56:31.360
and you just start having this like,
this fantasy of like,

897
00:56:31.750 --> 00:56:36.570
what if I just walked away?
Yeah.
Right.
Like,

898
00:56:36.571 --> 00:56:39.390
seriously.
What if I just walked away?

899
00:56:39.420 --> 00:56:43.350
Like for good?
Like if it,
well,
what did we,

900
00:56:43.351 --> 00:56:47.520
what it was that easy to get out of a fucking relationship,
you know,

901
00:56:47.550 --> 00:56:52.290
there wasn't a talk that wasn't like the whole,
yeah.
You know,
I'm just not you.

902
00:56:52.291 --> 00:56:55.900
It's me.
I'm just,
I'm not happy.
I'm not happy.
And,
uh,

903
00:56:56.460 --> 00:56:57.450
it's not fair for you,

904
00:56:57.810 --> 00:57:01.380
for me to still be in this thing when you should be out there and you should be

905
00:57:01.381 --> 00:57:03.750
with a guy who,
who,
you know,

906
00:57:04.310 --> 00:57:07.110
is going to give you all those emotional things that I,
I can't,

907
00:57:07.111 --> 00:57:08.310
and I don't know why it is,

908
00:57:08.311 --> 00:57:13.311
but I need to go figure it out and I'm just very painful for me to do.

909
00:57:14.430 --> 00:57:17.410
I have a lot of guilt and uh,

910
00:57:18.640 --> 00:57:23.050
well even feeling this way,
uh,
for the last three minutes,
you know,
you can't,

911
00:57:23.051 --> 00:57:26.050
you can never say like I probably since the second date,
but you know,

912
00:57:26.051 --> 00:57:28.310
you were fucking me.
Good.
So I stuck around and uh,

913
00:57:28.360 --> 00:57:33.070
here it is eight months later and uh,
I've always hated this couch.

914
00:57:33.220 --> 00:57:37.670
So
sorry,
go ahead.
Take a drink there.
You don't want to be great for you.
You just,

915
00:57:37.700 --> 00:57:38.900
you just fucking walk away.

916
00:57:39.200 --> 00:57:41.960
I've always been envious of those people who like abandoned their families.

917
00:57:42.320 --> 00:57:45.080
Not that they do that,
that's like a terrible thing to do.
But like,

918
00:57:45.260 --> 00:57:48.800
I want to feel that euphoria at some point in my life.

919
00:57:48.801 --> 00:57:53.770
Can you imagine how fucking unhappy you are as a man?

920
00:57:54.340 --> 00:57:59.340
That you have a wife and children and you are so miserable

921
00:58:01.580 --> 00:58:05.450
that you're actually contemplating just walking away from it all,
you know?

922
00:58:06.620 --> 00:58:10.640
Okay.
But it's like a fantasy.
You're not going to you like,
I can't,
I got kids.

923
00:58:10.641 --> 00:58:13.670
I can't fucking do that.
I can't be that fucking piece of shit.

924
00:58:13.671 --> 00:58:16.880
Like in a blues song,
you'd go out to get cigarettes.
He never come back again.

925
00:58:17.180 --> 00:58:20.630
But the guys who actually fucking do,
and I know there's a loneliness,

926
00:58:20.631 --> 00:58:21.680
I know there's a guilt,

927
00:58:22.490 --> 00:58:27.490
but that feeling right as you're standing in the doorway to your kitchen on the

928
00:58:28.300 --> 00:58:30.860
weighty a back door,
you know,

929
00:58:31.280 --> 00:58:35.450
and she's just sitting there giving you shit or whatever the fuck it is that

930
00:58:35.451 --> 00:58:37.370
she's just,
she's eaten that English muffin.

931
00:58:37.371 --> 00:58:41.930
The way she eats it and the side of her fucking temples are going in and out and

932
00:58:41.931 --> 00:58:45.950
you just can't stand it.
She's doing that thing the way she clears her throat.

933
00:58:47.510 --> 00:58:51.610
Right.
And you're like just going like,
hey honey,

934
00:58:51.640 --> 00:58:54.010
I'm going to go return this video.
Okay,

935
00:58:55.480 --> 00:58:56.313
<v 10>Gia.</v>

936
00:58:56.690 --> 00:58:59.650
<v 3>Hey,
when you make,
when you learn your way,
Huh?</v>

937
00:59:00.770 --> 00:59:02.410
<v 10>Yeah.
[inaudible]</v>

938
00:59:04.300 --> 00:59:06.870
<v 3>Daniella.
Yeah,
absolutely.
You know,</v>

939
00:59:08.580 --> 00:59:09.660
and then you get in the car.

940
00:59:09.661 --> 00:59:14.280
You already got your fucking bag of clothes in there or some shit.

941
00:59:15.690 --> 00:59:18.240
I mean,
it should drive it out.
The dry mean.

942
00:59:18.260 --> 00:59:22.130
You just must be who like what song do you fucking listen to?

943
00:59:22.250 --> 00:59:26.720
What is the soundtrack as anybody ever abandoned a family?
Any listeners?

944
00:59:26.750 --> 00:59:31.750
What Song were you listening to on your iPod when you turn the fucking corner,

945
00:59:32.930 --> 00:59:33.710
you know,

946
00:59:33.710 --> 00:59:37.640
you gotta feel like Tim Robbins when he comes up out of that fucking sewer
water.

947
00:59:38.570 --> 00:59:38.870
You know,

948
00:59:38.870 --> 00:59:41.990
and I'm sure you have your fantasy that you're going to be sitting there on a

949
00:59:41.991 --> 00:59:45.590
beach building a boat,
you know,

950
00:59:45.591 --> 00:59:50.150
with some Tan tidied Hati that you met on fucking Facebook,
right?

951
00:59:50.720 --> 00:59:53.270
And just when you think she's going to find you and you're going to have to pay

952
00:59:53.271 --> 00:59:55.040
child support,
you look up,
who is it?

953
00:59:55.040 --> 00:59:59.990
It's fucking Morgan Freeman and a little reservoir dogs sue with a fucking bing

954
00:59:59.991 --> 01:00:04.430
Crosby hat.
Right?
I know that's what you fantasize about,

955
01:00:04.431 --> 01:00:07.250
but then you end up in a fucking motel six.
We won't go there.

956
01:00:07.460 --> 01:00:11.720
But I would love to feel that fucking,
that euphoria.

957
01:00:13.700 --> 01:00:14.533
You know,

958
01:00:15.110 --> 01:00:18.800
I felt it a few times when I had skipped school that will be driving on the way

959
01:00:18.801 --> 01:00:20.950
to school and all of a sudden I just think,
you know what?

960
01:00:20.960 --> 01:00:24.140
I don't feel like going today.
And I would keep going and it just,

961
01:00:24.530 --> 01:00:29.000
with no power whatsoever that I could control my emotions.

962
01:00:29.001 --> 01:00:33.230
I would just break into an ear to ear grin and I would,
I have just,
you know,

963
01:00:33.231 --> 01:00:37.310
go to a fucking movie.
You know,
I did.
I still by myself,

964
01:00:37.340 --> 01:00:41.750
I'd skip school by myself.
I came in,
what the fuck I do.
I drive around.

965
01:00:41.960 --> 01:00:46.280
I would drive out to fucking,
uh,
I go look at the fucking spot,
a nerd I was,

966
01:00:46.810 --> 01:00:50.780
I'd go out and I go look at a Sullivan stadium where the Patriots used to play.

967
01:00:51.110 --> 01:00:55.900
I just go look at it,
you know,
go out,

968
01:00:55.910 --> 01:01:00.560
go get a fucking breakfast at like the Ihub just thinking I'd be in math class

969
01:01:00.561 --> 01:01:05.561
right now I'm eating pancakes and I should be listening to some guy talking

970
01:01:06.171 --> 01:01:09.920
about first outside,
inside last,
right.

971
01:01:11.230 --> 01:01:14.300
I mean,
how the fuck I got on this subject when you're talking about shoes,

972
01:01:14.301 --> 01:01:17.270
we were talking about shoe.
So anyways,
you probably wondering,
Bill,

973
01:01:17.271 --> 01:01:21.230
how did the taping go?
Well,
if he can hear the fucking joy in my voice,

974
01:01:22.280 --> 01:01:26.660
I can't help you.
It was awesome.
The first show when fucking great.

975
01:01:26.661 --> 01:01:29.810
And then the second show was just,
it was over the top.

976
01:01:30.380 --> 01:01:33.560
And I'm like I said,
it was at the Fillmore,

977
01:01:34.190 --> 01:01:37.400
absolutely legendary place.
They had all these day of,
um,

978
01:01:37.460 --> 01:01:41.060
all the posters from all the bands that have played there.
You know,

979
01:01:41.270 --> 01:01:44.290
recently they have that room and then they have the classic room where they

980
01:01:44.300 --> 01:01:45.590
literally had posters,

981
01:01:46.610 --> 01:01:50.810
like a pink Floyd poster that said it said from England,
Pink Floyd.

982
01:01:51.560 --> 01:01:52.850
It just gave me chills to read it.

983
01:01:52.851 --> 01:01:56.890
Like they were like pink Floyd was that knew that they needed some something

984
01:01:56.960 --> 01:01:59.360
they needed like a hook to get people to go see him.

985
01:02:00.620 --> 01:02:03.740
And the hook was that they were from England,
you know,
cause the whole,
you know,

986
01:02:03.741 --> 01:02:08.090
the Beatles,
the rolling stones at that point.
And I think,
I think the,

987
01:02:08.091 --> 01:02:10.700
who had already been here at by that point,
I don't know why,
but like,
you know,

988
01:02:10.701 --> 01:02:14.720
the whole British invasion that happened.
So they had this,
you know,

989
01:02:14.900 --> 01:02:18.950
pink fucking Floyd from England and from England.

990
01:02:19.380 --> 01:02:22.290
I think you ought to give them a chance.
They Call Pink Floyd.

991
01:02:22.291 --> 01:02:25.360
I know it's a weird name.
They had all those kinds of posters.

992
01:02:25.380 --> 01:02:26.850
They had a posted there for Lenny Bruce.

993
01:02:26.851 --> 01:02:31.470
I found out he did his last performances were right there.
And um,

994
01:02:32.700 --> 01:02:37.590
it just gave me goosebumps and uh,
it was great.
The first show,

995
01:02:38.020 --> 01:02:38.970
the first show went great.

996
01:02:38.971 --> 01:02:43.530
I was sweating a little bit because I had taken this fucking dayquil and the

997
01:02:43.531 --> 01:02:47.190
combination of that in the spotlight.
So it got to the point about,
you know,

998
01:02:47.191 --> 01:02:51.780
two thirds of the way through my set,
you know,
you know,

999
01:02:51.781 --> 01:02:56.700
I had to fucking towel myself off like I was playing racket ball.
So,

1000
01:02:57.270 --> 01:02:59.930
uh,
yeah,
anything past that I'm not going to use that,
you know,

1001
01:02:59.940 --> 01:03:02.670
I'm not going to be able to,
cause the second one went,
went off without a hitch.

1002
01:03:02.940 --> 01:03:06.150
I didn't take any cold medication and I just,
you know,

1003
01:03:06.151 --> 01:03:09.450
I already knew I had a great taping and then send them the second one.

1004
01:03:09.451 --> 01:03:11.850
I just went off and a,

1005
01:03:11.851 --> 01:03:16.080
I literally felt like I was standing in a comedy club and I was going through 10

1006
01:03:16.081 --> 01:03:20.310
to 15 minute chunks where I wasn't even aware.

1007
01:03:20.790 --> 01:03:24.390
I wasn't even thinking that I was taping a special,
you know,

1008
01:03:24.420 --> 01:03:28.560
I definitely knew I was,
but I w I wasn't like thinking about that.

1009
01:03:28.561 --> 01:03:31.680
There were cameras there.
I was just focusing on what I was saying.

1010
01:03:32.430 --> 01:03:35.220
I kind of learned this trick out of trick my head into doing that,

1011
01:03:35.221 --> 01:03:38.100
which is basically I improv a little bit up front,

1012
01:03:38.460 --> 01:03:41.730
which saps me into the presence,
the present,
you know,

1013
01:03:42.630 --> 01:03:44.910
as opposed to me and in robot mode.
So I want anyways,

1014
01:03:45.330 --> 01:03:46.890
it was fucking unbelievable.

1015
01:03:47.160 --> 01:03:51.540
They made me a poster so my poster is actually going to be hanging there.

1016
01:03:51.540 --> 01:03:54.150
I don't know how long they'll hang it there because uh,
you know,

1017
01:03:54.151 --> 01:03:58.320
it's one of those deals they revolve them around and who the fuck am I?

1018
01:03:58.321 --> 01:04:02.100
But for a moment it's going to be hanging in there.
Um,

1019
01:04:02.790 --> 01:04:04.980
and uh,
I don't know.
My parents came out,

1020
01:04:05.250 --> 01:04:09.810
they stuck out all my friends and family in this,
this VIP,
um,

1021
01:04:10.050 --> 01:04:12.570
you know,
like,
like you don't like the old guys on the muppets.

1022
01:04:12.600 --> 01:04:15.030
It was something like that in the back of the room and the whole town would just

1023
01:04:15.220 --> 01:04:16.053
stick in there.

1024
01:04:16.200 --> 01:04:19.620
Like Bill Graham probably stood there the first time he wants Jimmy Hendrix.

1025
01:04:19.621 --> 01:04:24.150
It was,
it was fucking unbelievable.
It was unbelievable.
And,

1026
01:04:24.630 --> 01:04:28.950
um,
I actually,
I don't know.
I was,

1027
01:04:28.980 --> 01:04:33.660
I was beyond site at the end of it and uh,
and then the second and ended,

1028
01:04:34.080 --> 01:04:36.060
I finally fucking relaxed a little bit.

1029
01:04:36.061 --> 01:04:39.510
And then that's when the sickness that had been trying to get me just completely

1030
01:04:39.511 --> 01:04:42.420
took over.
But I didn't give a fuck at that point.

1031
01:04:43.020 --> 01:04:46.020
And I battled it with some alcohol,
but whatever.

1032
01:04:46.021 --> 01:04:50.560
I want to thank everybody who came out to,
uh,
my,

1033
01:04:50.590 --> 01:04:55.470
my tapings.
It was,
it's something that I will never ever forget,
um,

1034
01:04:55.530 --> 01:05:00.530
to perform in a venue that legendary was very humbling and I'm so psyched that I

1035
01:05:00.841 --> 01:05:03.510
had,
um,
I dunno,
I want to say,

1036
01:05:03.511 --> 01:05:07.140
I think I had the best performance I've had for a TV taping up to this point in

1037
01:05:07.141 --> 01:05:11.340
my career.
And,
uh,
it was awesome.
And I want to thank everybody who went,

1038
01:05:11.700 --> 01:05:16.700
including this guy who sent me an email after the,

1039
01:05:17.070 --> 01:05:17.440
uh,

1040
01:05:17.440 --> 01:05:22.440
the taping a under the title of lackluster and this guy has earned douche bag of

1041
01:05:24.641 --> 01:05:27.790
the week.
Yes.
Everybody.
Um,

1042
01:05:28.540 --> 01:05:32.620
this is one of these things where you just can't please everybody and you know

1043
01:05:33.520 --> 01:05:38.290
what kind of a content we would send somebody an email like this,

1044
01:05:38.410 --> 01:05:42.490
you know,
lack luster.
This is the beauty of the Internet that I,

1045
01:05:42.491 --> 01:05:45.670
that I really find.
I think the Internet is fucking hilarious.

1046
01:05:45.730 --> 01:05:49.780
How just any random shithead,
you know,

1047
01:05:50.440 --> 01:05:53.380
I don't know if it's just me cause I pretty much read all my emails,
but like,

1048
01:05:53.381 --> 01:05:57.250
you know,
if you got something bad to tell me this,
you know,
you got a 90% chance,

1049
01:05:57.251 --> 01:05:59.680
I'm going to fucking read it.
Um,

1050
01:05:59.950 --> 01:06:01.900
I just think that's funny because back in the day,
you know,

1051
01:06:01.901 --> 01:06:05.260
I used to watch TV and I'd be watching people go,
this guy's and fucking funny.

1052
01:06:05.320 --> 01:06:09.130
Or there's this guy sucks.
Why does he keep doing movies?
But I,

1053
01:06:09.160 --> 01:06:12.070
but it was just to the TV or to the guy sitting next to me.

1054
01:06:12.071 --> 01:06:15.760
I couldn't actually get it to the person.
So,
uh,
you know,

1055
01:06:16.090 --> 01:06:20.230
how about that for technology?
So this is what the guy writes.
He writes bell.

1056
01:06:20.230 --> 01:06:24.430
To be honest,
I was disappointed at your Fillmore show.
Um,

1057
01:06:24.610 --> 01:06:27.220
I am a big fan,
but I am also a realist.

1058
01:06:28.570 --> 01:06:29.980
I don't even know what that means.

1059
01:06:30.640 --> 01:06:32.560
I guess that means he was expecting something big,

1060
01:06:32.561 --> 01:06:36.460
but I didn't deliver and I have to be honest with you,
bill,
you didn't deliver.

1061
01:06:36.610 --> 01:06:40.330
I mean,
what a cunt,
right?
He goes,
first off,
I was very disappointing,

1062
01:06:40.540 --> 01:06:45.370
very disappointed at the recording of audience applause and laughter.

1063
01:06:46.060 --> 01:06:50.650
I thought it was the opening guys last bit.
I was the asshole that booed.

1064
01:06:50.920 --> 01:06:53.500
Laughter and applause tracks are weak.

1065
01:06:53.740 --> 01:06:57.580
What he's saying is right before they brought me on the opening act said,

1066
01:06:58.630 --> 01:07:02.560
okay,
we need you guys to do us a favor.
Okay,
I'm going to count to three.

1067
01:07:03.220 --> 01:07:06.370
And when I count to three,
I want you guys just,
everybody laughed.

1068
01:07:06.371 --> 01:07:09.520
Like you just heard something that was kind of funny.
And then one,
two,

1069
01:07:09.521 --> 01:07:13.270
three in the crowds,
like Ah,
whatever.
Right?
And they go,
okay,
that was great.

1070
01:07:13.271 --> 01:07:14.051
That was great.
All right.

1071
01:07:14.051 --> 01:07:16.960
Now this time I want you to laugh a little bit more like you'd like to act like

1072
01:07:16.961 --> 01:07:17.321
that was,

1073
01:07:17.321 --> 01:07:21.790
that was really funny and they laugh a little bit louder and then they go,
okay,

1074
01:07:21.791 --> 01:07:22.271
that was great.

1075
01:07:22.271 --> 01:07:26.320
Now the third time I want you guys to laugh like this is the funniest thing

1076
01:07:26.321 --> 01:07:27.520
you've ever heard.
One,
two,

1077
01:07:27.521 --> 01:07:32.521
three and everybody why but he's going is crazy so this guy booze and he says,

1078
01:07:33.341 --> 01:07:37.420
you know audience applause,
tracks and laughter are weak.

1079
01:07:38.050 --> 01:07:40.840
You know
sir,

1080
01:07:41.290 --> 01:07:45.940
this is why you are Douche bag of the week because what you did was you assumed

1081
01:07:46.480 --> 01:07:51.480
that we were recording those in an effort just in case I bombed that.

1082
01:07:51.911 --> 01:07:55.600
We were good.
Then going to use those to drop in laughter.

1083
01:07:55.900 --> 01:07:57.970
But we were actually doing sir,

1084
01:07:58.240 --> 01:08:03.240
was we were testing the levels of the audience and we wanted to make sure that

1085
01:08:05.051 --> 01:08:09.430
we were going to be able to capture anything that the audience did,

1086
01:08:09.431 --> 01:08:11.380
that if they found something mildly funny,

1087
01:08:11.620 --> 01:08:14.230
that the mix would be up enough where they would pick it up,

1088
01:08:14.620 --> 01:08:19.580
but they wouldn't be up so much that if people went crazy.

1089
01:08:20.090 --> 01:08:22.250
What happens is,
is if oh fit like overloads,

1090
01:08:22.251 --> 01:08:23.570
I don't know what the technical thing is.

1091
01:08:23.571 --> 01:08:27.230
The microphone shuts off basically when it red lines,

1092
01:08:27.231 --> 01:08:30.440
it's almost like a car or something.
Like it seizes up,
it just stops.

1093
01:08:30.710 --> 01:08:34.670
So what you have to do before you go out there is you have to make sure that you

1094
01:08:34.671 --> 01:08:38.090
have your mix at the right level and you do it with every crowd.

1095
01:08:38.270 --> 01:08:40.880
Cause every crowd is different.
It's a different group of people.

1096
01:08:40.880 --> 01:08:41.990
There's a different energy.

1097
01:08:42.170 --> 01:08:46.820
And what you're trying to do is you've got to capture that live sound of the

1098
01:08:46.821 --> 01:08:48.680
room.
So what we were doing there sir,

1099
01:08:49.370 --> 01:08:53.180
was we were basically doing an audience,
um,

1100
01:08:54.470 --> 01:08:57.890
like a soundcheck,
like,
you know,
when the artist comes out,

1101
01:08:57.900 --> 01:09:01.670
he's like [inaudible] test one,
two,
hey,

1102
01:09:02.000 --> 01:09:03.770
hey Yo,

1103
01:09:03.830 --> 01:09:07.340
you know all that shit that they do and what you're supposed to do is also be,

1104
01:09:07.341 --> 01:09:10.630
you know,
bringing your voice up loud,
going away from the Michael and Liz,

1105
01:09:10.670 --> 01:09:12.020
there's a way to do it or whatever.

1106
01:09:12.260 --> 01:09:16.170
They were basically doing that for you because they had already done a sound

1107
01:09:16.580 --> 01:09:20.240
check for me.
So that's what they were doing.
You fucking moron.

1108
01:09:21.180 --> 01:09:21.621
All right.

1109
01:09:21.621 --> 01:09:26.540
And I understand that you're not in this business so you should know what that

1110
01:09:26.541 --> 01:09:27.410
is,
but you know,

1111
01:09:27.590 --> 01:09:30.050
there was plenty of people standing around from the crew that you could have

1112
01:09:30.051 --> 01:09:33.830
asked before you left before you went on Facebook and fucking trash me.

1113
01:09:34.850 --> 01:09:38.150
Like I'm like a,
um,
I'm trying to get,
you know,

1114
01:09:39.290 --> 01:09:42.530
that would be almost like,
like I lip sync to my act.
That's so,

1115
01:09:42.531 --> 01:09:44.600
that's not what was happening,
sir.
All right,

1116
01:09:44.970 --> 01:09:49.430
you fucking douchebag Jesus.
Maybe.
Maybe at Santos,
next special.

1117
01:09:49.431 --> 01:09:51.860
I'm going to make sure the openers says,
look,
and we're not going to use these.

1118
01:09:51.861 --> 01:09:53.780
What we're doing is we're basically doing a soundcheck.

1119
01:09:53.930 --> 01:09:56.330
And plus if this guy had half a brain,

1120
01:09:56.331 --> 01:09:59.990
he would've listened to the laughter because most people were not laughing.

1121
01:10:00.560 --> 01:10:04.010
What they were doing was they were going,
woo.
You know,

1122
01:10:04.011 --> 01:10:08.690
and the funniest thing ever there was screaming.
So it didn't,

1123
01:10:08.870 --> 01:10:11.420
the audio wouldn't have sounded like I told the joke or what.

1124
01:10:11.421 --> 01:10:15.920
It sounded like some drunk jumped up on stage and was about to take his dick
out.

1125
01:10:15.950 --> 01:10:17.330
That's what the crowd sound likes.

1126
01:10:17.331 --> 01:10:22.220
I always actually backstage laughing when I was listening to it.
Um,

1127
01:10:23.420 --> 01:10:26.210
so there you go,
sir.
That's,
that's what was going on.

1128
01:10:26.240 --> 01:10:28.990
And then he also goes on to say that he just recently hits,

1129
01:10:29.060 --> 01:10:33.980
he saw my last show at the punchline and that he was disappointed that when he

1130
01:10:33.981 --> 01:10:37.430
went to go to the DVD recording that he barely heard any new material.

1131
01:10:37.880 --> 01:10:42.170
So he was basically mad that he saw me getting ready for my special.

1132
01:10:42.830 --> 01:10:44.900
And then when he went to go see my special,

1133
01:10:44.901 --> 01:10:48.110
that the jokes that I was working on during the night that he saw me,

1134
01:10:48.830 --> 01:10:49.880
we're the same jokes.

1135
01:10:52.280 --> 01:10:54.740
This guy is such a fucking moron and so many levels.

1136
01:10:54.741 --> 01:10:59.180
It's like you can't go out and wing a special,
sir.
You can't do it.

1137
01:10:59.360 --> 01:11:00.470
Comics have tried it.

1138
01:11:00.500 --> 01:11:05.120
I've seen comics go out with a legal pad and some ideas written down there and

1139
01:11:05.121 --> 01:11:07.550
you'll have moments where you're riffing and it's going great,

1140
01:11:07.760 --> 01:11:11.460
but there's a reason why you don't do that.
All right?

1141
01:11:11.600 --> 01:11:15.840
You've got to have the act okay to Improv.

1142
01:11:15.870 --> 01:11:19.980
Even like these fucking Improv people who are in these improv groups and they

1143
01:11:19.981 --> 01:11:22.320
try to act like the whole fucking thing they do well,

1144
01:11:22.321 --> 01:11:26.040
it's all off the top of the head.
The fucking audience suggest Shit,
you know?

1145
01:11:26.041 --> 01:11:29.820
And it's really just off the top of your head the first fucking time you do it

1146
01:11:30.330 --> 01:11:31.300
because the more you do those in,

1147
01:11:31.440 --> 01:11:32.970
because I used to watch this in Prague group every week.

1148
01:11:33.010 --> 01:11:35.040
They used to come down to the laugh factory.
The first time I saw,
I was like,

1149
01:11:35.041 --> 01:11:36.060
wow man,
it's fucking amazing.

1150
01:11:36.270 --> 01:11:39.300
But you start watching it after awhile and you're like,
oh,

1151
01:11:39.480 --> 01:11:42.390
that guy always does this.
This person always does that.

1152
01:11:42.990 --> 01:11:47.550
And you know,
and then there's also repeat suggestions.

1153
01:11:47.551 --> 01:11:50.730
Give me a job and it's a job you've heard before.
You know,

1154
01:11:50.731 --> 01:11:53.580
I'm not shitting on those guys,
but you know,
it's one of those deals.

1155
01:11:54.420 --> 01:11:56.550
So that's the deal,
sir.

1156
01:11:56.760 --> 01:12:01.170
That's why you heard the same material and that's why you heard,
uh,

1157
01:12:01.171 --> 01:12:05.490
and that's why we were doing the applause tracks.
Okay.
So I am not,
uh,

1158
01:12:07.320 --> 01:12:09.300
I dunno.
I Dunno what to tell you do,
but you know,

1159
01:12:10.200 --> 01:12:13.260
that's really fucking annoying that you,
that you,
that,
you know,

1160
01:12:13.470 --> 01:12:16.410
to have to read a fucking email like that and one of the best nights of my

1161
01:12:16.411 --> 01:12:19.560
fucking career to have put,
I mean,
that's,
that's power for the fucking course.

1162
01:12:19.560 --> 01:12:22.230
What are you going to do?
You know,
what are you going to fucking do?

1163
01:12:22.231 --> 01:12:25.110
So there you go.
This douche bag of the week.
I'm trying to do more of these,
uh,

1164
01:12:25.860 --> 01:12:28.050
my old little standards here.
Whatever.
You want to call them,

1165
01:12:28.051 --> 01:12:31.790
a different topics here because somebody actually sent me an email telling any,

1166
01:12:31.840 --> 01:12:35.220
you know,
you'd never do any of your topics anymore.
And,
uh,

1167
01:12:35.221 --> 01:12:39.150
I think the person was right.
So I'm trying to a to get back to that shit.

1168
01:12:39.690 --> 01:12:42.270
So,
uh,
let's read a couple more emails here.

1169
01:12:42.271 --> 01:12:45.030
This one's going to be a little bit short because I haven't done any fucking

1170
01:12:45.031 --> 01:12:49.260
Christmas shopping because I've been,
uh,
getting ready to do my special.

1171
01:12:50.700 --> 01:12:53.940
Um,
anyways,
uh,
built.
Now here's,
here's,

1172
01:12:53.950 --> 01:12:57.360
this is an email that I got from somebody and this really amazed me.

1173
01:12:57.510 --> 01:13:02.510
This minds set amazes me and I understand that I am not a doctor and that I am

1174
01:13:03.301 --> 01:13:06.930
not a scientist.
So,
uh,

1175
01:13:06.960 --> 01:13:11.670
I really can't medically defend my positioning other than I just think I'm right

1176
01:13:11.700 --> 01:13:15.180
on this one.
All right.
Um,

1177
01:13:16.440 --> 01:13:18.930
all right,
Bill,
I dunno if you will actually do a subject for this,

1178
01:13:18.931 --> 01:13:23.931
but I've gotten a ton into a ton of arguments with friends slash strangers about

1179
01:13:26.670 --> 01:13:31.670
how now it's being said that homosexuals are born homosexuals.

1180
01:13:32.520 --> 01:13:35.040
They're saying it's like a gene.
Personally,

1181
01:13:35.041 --> 01:13:37.530
I think it's the dumbest fucking thing I've ever heard.

1182
01:13:37.830 --> 01:13:40.140
And to me it seems like a big excuse.

1183
01:13:40.170 --> 01:13:43.830
So the world will leave the gay community alone.

1184
01:13:46.080 --> 01:13:49.920
I didn't know the world was,
was bugging them.
Um,

1185
01:13:49.921 --> 01:13:54.240
I've been leaving the gay community alone my entire life.
Oh,
that's not true.

1186
01:13:54.241 --> 01:13:58.740
I laughed.
It's a lot of homophobic shit when I was younger,
you know.
All right.

1187
01:13:58.741 --> 01:14:03.630
Hang on a second.
Fuck.

1188
01:14:05.610 --> 01:14:08.730
Anyways.
Personally,
if you want a dick in your ass,

1189
01:14:08.731 --> 01:14:13.120
by all means get her done.
There's a major red flag.

1190
01:14:20.760 --> 01:14:20.860
<v 8>Ah,</v>

1191
01:14:20.860 --> 01:14:25.510
<v 3>people are still saying that.
You know,
you got to dream in life.</v>

1192
01:14:25.511 --> 01:14:30.420
Keep on trucking a whoop.
There it is.
Um,

1193
01:14:30.460 --> 01:14:33.910
just think it's a choice anyways.

1194
01:14:34.660 --> 01:14:38.720
I just think it's a choice.
And you choose to be a flame or um,

1195
01:14:38.770 --> 01:14:42.610
if you want to get tactical,
then how dumb would it be to say,
yeah,
dude,

1196
01:14:42.611 --> 01:14:47.611
fucking Michael Jordan had a gene in his body and he was born out of the vag to

1197
01:14:47.801 --> 01:14:52.180
be a basketball player.
I think it's absolute bullshit.
And if you are gay,

1198
01:14:52.210 --> 01:14:54.280
who gives a fuck about what the world thinks?

1199
01:14:54.281 --> 01:14:56.410
Just do what you want and screw everybody.
Right.

1200
01:14:56.920 --> 01:15:01.820
And they're also saying being gay is the new black,
uh,
who,

1201
01:15:01.880 --> 01:15:04.900
who are these people who are saying this?
Are they saying this on TV?

1202
01:15:05.380 --> 01:15:08.430
That sounds like a fashion show.
Yeah.
Oh,

1203
01:15:08.440 --> 01:15:13.380
next up gay is the new black.
Oh yeah.
Mother fuckers.

1204
01:15:13.890 --> 01:15:15.280
Uh,
I'm sorry.

1205
01:15:15.281 --> 01:15:19.390
But comparing homosexuals to African Americans seems like the biggest slap in

1206
01:15:19.391 --> 01:15:20.980
the face to the black community.

1207
01:15:21.380 --> 01:15:25.360
These guys really big on saying community and giving back handed compliments.
Um,

1208
01:15:25.390 --> 01:15:30.070
anyway,
I'm a moron.
And if you,
uh,
what's your opinion on the subject?
Uh,

1209
01:15:30.071 --> 01:15:34.890
yeah,
I would agree with you.
You are a moron and a no.

1210
01:15:34.891 --> 01:15:37.320
I think gay people are born that way and yes,

1211
01:15:37.321 --> 01:15:40.740
I think Michael Jordan was Michael Jordan was born with a gift.

1212
01:15:42.290 --> 01:15:46.050
Do you think you can just practice?
You know,
no matter how proud,

1213
01:15:46.051 --> 01:15:50.520
hard I practiced to fuck it,
I could never take off from the fire line,

1214
01:15:50.940 --> 01:15:54.090
dunk a basketball.
I could never change the game.

1215
01:15:54.780 --> 01:15:59.760
He changed the fucking game.
He was born,
he was born with a gift.
He was,

1216
01:16:01.380 --> 01:16:04.330
um,
I don't think that that's a,
that's a,
uh,

1217
01:16:06.480 --> 01:16:07.740
that's a good example though.

1218
01:16:07.920 --> 01:16:10.260
Cause you're talking about something more like that was a gift.

1219
01:16:10.630 --> 01:16:14.730
Well you should have used it as an example.
That's like saying you were,
you came,

1220
01:16:14.970 --> 01:16:18.060
you w you were born just to like pussy.
You know,

1221
01:16:18.120 --> 01:16:20.280
what was the big turning point in your life,
sir?

1222
01:16:20.520 --> 01:16:23.280
Where there was a dick on the table and a vagina.

1223
01:16:23.310 --> 01:16:28.310
Do you remember like what was it that made you finally make the decision that

1224
01:16:29.491 --> 01:16:32.660
you are going to like women think about it.

1225
01:16:33.350 --> 01:16:36.290
They never really was a choice was there,
you just did.

1226
01:16:36.620 --> 01:16:40.580
It was just natural within you and someone could have made you aware of fucking

1227
01:16:40.581 --> 01:16:44.450
dress.
You know,
your whole fucking child.

1228
01:16:44.451 --> 01:16:48.470
Did you still want a bank j lo,
because that's how you're wired.
All right?

1229
01:16:48.800 --> 01:16:53.120
So
you know,
get your head out of your ass.

1230
01:16:53.121 --> 01:16:56.760
You fucking moron.
You're a moron.
You're a moron.
All right.

1231
01:16:57.790 --> 01:17:00.760
I actually went back and forth text messaging and then he brought up the Bible.

1232
01:17:00.761 --> 01:17:04.900
How it says that the fucking Bible you just said,
you know,
God Damn Bible,

1233
01:17:04.901 --> 01:17:09.530
I swear to God,
I can't,
I can't get over how stupid most are.

1234
01:17:09.531 --> 01:17:14.531
Who read the fucking Bible where they're reading this stuff and it's supposed to

1235
01:17:14.601 --> 01:17:17.690
make them this,
this,
this more,
uh,

1236
01:17:18.170 --> 01:17:19.820
I don't know what holy or person.

1237
01:17:20.030 --> 01:17:24.110
And all it does is it just creates this fucking resentment to other people and

1238
01:17:24.140 --> 01:17:27.560
everything they,
they,
they fucking end up doing is like,

1239
01:17:27.620 --> 01:17:31.670
they just are lashing out at other people and it's just like,

1240
01:17:31.820 --> 01:17:36.050
how do they not see the fucking irony in that?
It doesn't even make any sense.

1241
01:17:36.051 --> 01:17:40.490
And how do you not understand that God didn't write that book and Dark God

1242
01:17:40.491 --> 01:17:42.380
wasn't yelling down from,
you know,

1243
01:17:44.220 --> 01:17:48.740
[inaudible] you know,
he wasn't doing that.
All right.

1244
01:17:48.920 --> 01:17:53.630
The 10 Commandments,
first of all are up,
came from people.
All right.

1245
01:17:54.020 --> 01:17:59.000
This is ridiculous.
I'm saying this like,
I know this for fact,
but
I dunno.

1246
01:17:59.030 --> 01:18:03.980
I think,
I think all of that.
I think morality,
unless you're born a sociopath,

1247
01:18:04.700 --> 01:18:07.370
morality is within you.

1248
01:18:08.300 --> 01:18:11.660
And I think your feelings have a higher power and afterlife,

1249
01:18:11.690 --> 01:18:13.160
all of that are within you.

1250
01:18:13.850 --> 01:18:17.960
And that natural feeling of when you do something good,
you feel good,

1251
01:18:18.110 --> 01:18:22.460
and when you do something bad,
you feel bad.
Is

1252
01:18:24.350 --> 01:18:26.720
that to me is the higher power.

1253
01:18:27.470 --> 01:18:30.860
I don't need to go into a frigging church or any of that.
Okay.

1254
01:18:30.861 --> 01:18:34.010
I believe in all that meditating.
I believe in a lot of stuff,

1255
01:18:34.430 --> 01:18:37.820
but I also believe that the same way you guys could be going like,
dude,

1256
01:18:37.821 --> 01:18:40.220
what is this based in?
You don't know what the fuck you talking about.

1257
01:18:41.210 --> 01:18:44.210
That's but neither have the people in the church.
They don't know either.

1258
01:18:44.211 --> 01:18:47.060
They've never died.
They don't know what the fuck.
It's all fucking guests,

1259
01:18:47.600 --> 01:18:51.680
but all I know
is that you know,

1260
01:18:51.770 --> 01:18:54.740
I'm not going to walk around and starting to fucking hate people because some

1261
01:18:54.741 --> 01:18:59.630
fucking book that some guy wrote,
you know,
thousands of years.
It's stupid.

1262
01:18:59.660 --> 01:19:03.410
It's fucking stupid.
All right.
You don't know what you're talking about,
sir.

1263
01:19:03.440 --> 01:19:06.920
The same way you naturally like,
okay,

1264
01:19:06.921 --> 01:19:10.580
if being gay was a choice than being heterosexual would be a choice.

1265
01:19:10.581 --> 01:19:13.910
And at some point in your life,
you got to tell me when you made that choice,

1266
01:19:14.150 --> 01:19:15.170
when you were sitting there,

1267
01:19:15.290 --> 01:19:19.940
you know when you were looking at Tommy and you were looking at Stephanie and

1268
01:19:19.941 --> 01:19:24.410
you're like,
ah,
how am I going to play this?
How am I gonna fucking play this?

1269
01:19:24.470 --> 01:19:28.880
You know,
think about it.
There's that time when you're a little kid,

1270
01:19:29.440 --> 01:19:32.150
whereas a boy,
girls are gross.
You're like,
ah,

1271
01:19:32.151 --> 01:19:36.020
that grows and they touch here and then you got fucking germs and then you

1272
01:19:36.021 --> 01:19:39.320
fucking wipe it off.
You try to touch somebody else with,
remember that,

1273
01:19:39.321 --> 01:19:43.850
that dumb shit.
But during that point,
because you're finding them repulsive,

1274
01:19:44.180 --> 01:19:46.100
you're not looking at your best buddy going,
oh,

1275
01:19:46.250 --> 01:19:50.180
what I love to get him in the tree fort.
You know,
you just go play football.

1276
01:19:51.050 --> 01:19:52.850
Then gradually get a little bit older,
right?

1277
01:19:52.851 --> 01:19:55.130
The girls get a little more physically attractive,

1278
01:19:55.280 --> 01:19:59.780
is that looking at their fucking clams and then you're in there and you spend

1279
01:19:59.781 --> 01:20:02.930
the rest of your life chasing it and it's totally,

1280
01:20:03.170 --> 01:20:08.130
completely 100% natural and that's,

1281
01:20:08.280 --> 01:20:11.820
you just flip around.
That's what gay guys do.
It's the same fucking thing.

1282
01:20:11.821 --> 01:20:15.780
It's not as she just born that way.
Stop being a fucking hateful comment.

1283
01:20:16.980 --> 01:20:21.840
All right,
there we go.
Oh,
that was very,
we are the world,

1284
01:20:21.841 --> 01:20:26.790
isn't it?
Look at me being all fucking accepting of people I don't hate.
Like,

1285
01:20:26.820 --> 01:20:28.060
like people like that.
Like if,

1286
01:20:28.090 --> 01:20:32.370
if a gay guy fucking is in front of me and he doesn't pull all the way out in

1287
01:20:32.371 --> 01:20:36.930
the fucking intersection,
you know,
so I can make the light too.

1288
01:20:36.960 --> 01:20:39.960
You know,
that's when I hate the guy,
you know,

1289
01:20:41.280 --> 01:20:44.730
fucking pull all the way out day you fucking cock sucker.

1290
01:20:47.700 --> 01:20:52.110
But it has to do with his driving,
not with his sexual preference.
All right,

1291
01:20:52.111 --> 01:20:56.970
let's plow ahead here.
All right,
broads,
this is the next topic.
Uh,

1292
01:20:57.000 --> 01:20:58.480
I need to,
um,

1293
01:20:59.190 --> 01:21:02.610
include myself into the manipulative discussion by mentioning,

1294
01:21:02.670 --> 01:21:05.880
I think he's talking about women here mentioning the occurrences of female

1295
01:21:05.881 --> 01:21:10.881
friends who seem to think you should do what a boyfriend would do even though

1296
01:21:11.010 --> 01:21:15.330
you're not and never will be their boyfriend.
Um,

1297
01:21:15.331 --> 01:21:16.530
my story is this.

1298
01:21:16.830 --> 01:21:21.450
I recently reconnected with the girl on Facebook that I basically just knew.

1299
01:21:21.990 --> 01:21:26.340
I knew of in high school and maybe had three conversations with in the whole

1300
01:21:26.341 --> 01:21:30.360
four year run.
All right.
He recently connected with her.
In other words,

1301
01:21:30.361 --> 01:21:32.190
he wanted to bang her back in the day,

1302
01:21:32.191 --> 01:21:36.240
but he either felt he was too much of a loser.
Yeah.

1303
01:21:36.380 --> 01:21:39.090
I recently reconnected.
You seek her out.

1304
01:21:39.160 --> 01:21:42.960
I wonder what she's doing that she's still look good.
God Damn even better.

1305
01:21:43.260 --> 01:21:47.490
She's 28,
probably knows how to suck a dick now.
I think I'm going to reconnect.

1306
01:21:47.700 --> 01:21:50.880
Good move sir.
Good move.
Um,

1307
01:21:50.881 --> 01:21:55.470
she likes cool music and I like cool music so we could connect on various videos

1308
01:21:55.471 --> 01:22:00.450
we posted,
etc.
Working your way in virally.
I liked this.
Um,

1309
01:22:00.451 --> 01:22:03.180
she was coming to New York where I live,
perfect.

1310
01:22:03.420 --> 01:22:06.990
From our home town for Thanksgiving sensor brother lives in Brooklyn.

1311
01:22:08.580 --> 01:22:10.330
Um,
now I was friends with her brother,

1312
01:22:10.331 --> 01:22:13.320
so I thought it would be cool to hang out with them at a bar.

1313
01:22:13.490 --> 01:22:14.400
Now it's getting a little weird.

1314
01:22:14.790 --> 01:22:17.940
You're friends with her brother and you're trying to bang her sister.
Um,

1315
01:22:18.120 --> 01:22:19.500
I'm really super imposing my thoughts.

1316
01:22:19.501 --> 01:22:23.230
Why don't I shut the fuck up and just read this.
Okay,
here we go.
Um,

1317
01:22:23.310 --> 01:22:24.240
everything went fine.

1318
01:22:24.241 --> 01:22:29.220
We had our drinks caught up on what we could catch up on and I thought that um,

1319
01:22:30.060 --> 01:22:33.900
I thought should,
should be at,
besides email,

1320
01:22:33.990 --> 01:22:37.140
left out some words and I thought that should,

1321
01:22:40.280 --> 01:22:40.531
I don't know,

1322
01:22:40.531 --> 01:22:45.240
some bullshit Facebook where it however some band is playing in New York and she

1323
01:22:45.241 --> 01:22:49.710
wants to go.
I think the band is fine,
but I'm not a real big fan.
All right.

1324
01:22:49.711 --> 01:22:52.200
I know.
I just couldn't read that last,

1325
01:22:52.230 --> 01:22:55.860
the previous sentence of basically she wants to go see a band that he's not

1326
01:22:55.861 --> 01:22:59.440
really into.
Um,
she seems to have her to heads that sense.

1327
01:22:59.460 --> 01:23:03.630
I happen to live in New York and I guess she has no one else to go see the

1328
01:23:03.631 --> 01:23:07.990
bandwidth that I should automatically to go with her to see a band.

1329
01:23:07.991 --> 01:23:12.310
I don't want to see with someone who was a friend and only the loosest of terms

1330
01:23:12.670 --> 01:23:14.050
I said I would pass.

1331
01:23:14.740 --> 01:23:18.400
And then that produced a flurry of passive aggressive emails.

1332
01:23:18.640 --> 01:23:23.020
The intent of which makes me feel like I rejected her,
of course,

1333
01:23:23.021 --> 01:23:26.860
that uh,
wasn't it,
but also what would it matter?

1334
01:23:26.861 --> 01:23:29.800
I barely know her.
Any reasonable person,

1335
01:23:29.980 --> 01:23:34.150
which should suggest the idea and if the idea isn't accepted would move on,

1336
01:23:34.510 --> 01:23:37.090
but she can't possibly go by herself.

1337
01:23:37.180 --> 01:23:39.760
So she's trying to manipulate me with self pity.

1338
01:23:40.030 --> 01:23:43.840
She just doesn't want to be alone.
She doesn't want to be alone.

1339
01:23:43.841 --> 01:23:47.350
My company or someone else's would make no difference.
So I finally,

1340
01:23:47.800 --> 01:23:52.720
so I find it all very insulting to my intelligence that she's trying to make me

1341
01:23:53.110 --> 01:23:56.470
think this is a connection only we share.
Um,

1342
01:23:56.560 --> 01:24:01.210
I made it clear I'm not going into the show anyways.

1343
01:24:01.211 --> 01:24:04.600
I've shared this with my friends and apparently that is widespread.

1344
01:24:04.900 --> 01:24:09.190
I just find it as getting out of control and a fee when a female in our lives

1345
01:24:09.191 --> 01:24:14.170
that is not in our family expects to be treated with the same considerations as

1346
01:24:14.171 --> 01:24:19.171
a romantic connection in which we obviously have to do shit we really don't want

1347
01:24:19.351 --> 01:24:23.740
to do.
All right.
Okay.

1348
01:24:23.741 --> 01:24:26.740
I see what you're saying here,
but I think,
um,

1349
01:24:29.380 --> 01:24:31.630
part of her probably wants to hook up with you.

1350
01:24:32.380 --> 01:24:36.010
So that's probably why she was feeling rejected a little bit.

1351
01:24:37.570 --> 01:24:40.780
Um,
but what I would do in that thing,
but now,
you know,

1352
01:24:40.781 --> 01:24:44.920
I'm really not feeling that,
but listen,
I know this cool bar,
you know,

1353
01:24:44.921 --> 01:24:48.490
up the street.
Maybe we can go do this,
blah,
blah blah.
See how that feels up.
Uh,

1354
01:24:48.610 --> 01:24:52.540
I dunno.
Maybe it did that.
I Dunno.
I Dunno.
But yeah,
that would be annoying.

1355
01:24:52.590 --> 01:24:55.350
You know,
if she wanted to go fucking see it.
I Dunno.
I Dunno how to,

1356
01:24:55.351 --> 01:24:58.660
I don't know how to,
uh,
how to answer this one here.

1357
01:24:59.680 --> 01:25:04.000
Think I'm on a fucking
missed the boat on this one.

1358
01:25:05.410 --> 01:25:08.260
Dude,
you shouldn't have to go to,
you know,
look at,
you know,
what you got to do.

1359
01:25:08.260 --> 01:25:08.651
I'll tell you,

1360
01:25:08.651 --> 01:25:13.540
if you guys want to see a great example of how to fucking handle women,

1361
01:25:13.900 --> 01:25:17.320
I swear to God,
watch the Jersey Shore.
Okay.

1362
01:25:17.321 --> 01:25:18.910
I know you're rolling your eyes right now.

1363
01:25:19.120 --> 01:25:21.550
And as much as people are laughing at that kid who's like,
you know,

1364
01:25:21.551 --> 01:25:25.690
it takes me 25 minutes to do my hair.
Oh my God,
I said not to touch it.

1365
01:25:25.691 --> 01:25:27.280
And then you touched it.
Oh,

1366
01:25:27.610 --> 01:25:32.350
that fucking dude who has the Travis Barker Cadillac Tattoo.

1367
01:25:33.760 --> 01:25:37.510
Um,
that fucking dude,
if you watch the episode was sneaky,

1368
01:25:37.511 --> 01:25:39.070
gets blasted in the face.

1369
01:25:39.670 --> 01:25:44.670
That dude understands exactly how to hook up with women and how not to get into

1370
01:25:47.231 --> 01:25:52.210
a fucking relationship.
And then also how not to give a fuck if they get mad.

1371
01:25:52.360 --> 01:25:54.640
He,
I'm telling you like I'm looking at that guy going,

1372
01:25:54.850 --> 01:25:59.850
this fucking guy possesses the knowledge of women that I,

1373
01:26:00.280 --> 01:26:04.820
it took me 41 years to figure out and he knows that 20 and he's in his peak

1374
01:26:04.821 --> 01:26:09.440
physical conditions.
Guys are fucking,
you'd get kids my hero when that dude,

1375
01:26:09.920 --> 01:26:12.350
uh,
uh,
the situation,
I was going to say,

1376
01:26:12.470 --> 01:26:16.430
the suggestion when he fucking comes back with the two girls,
right?

1377
01:26:16.431 --> 01:26:19.910
And one of them's a mass in the other one's hot and he's a fucking wing man for

1378
01:26:20.190 --> 01:26:20.510
forum.

1379
01:26:20.510 --> 01:26:23.630
He's hanging in there and he's hanging in there and then it gets to the point

1380
01:26:23.631 --> 01:26:28.210
where the other,
where the situation's not gonna Hook Up.
He taps out and he said,

1381
01:26:28.250 --> 01:26:31.040
he goes,
look,
you know the deal.
You meet him,
you bring him back,
give him a drink,

1382
01:26:31.041 --> 01:26:34.550
get him in the hot tub and then hook up with them.
You know,
that's the deal.

1383
01:26:34.551 --> 01:26:38.270
If you can't fucking do it,
I'm out.
And he just was totally fucking,

1384
01:26:38.930 --> 01:26:42.980
I'm telling you,
he has,
he has it down.
So what you got to do with this girls,

1385
01:26:43.970 --> 01:26:46.280
something like that is the girls coming around,
she's saying,

1386
01:26:46.281 --> 01:26:50.800
I want to go see this band.
Just don't ever get upset and just be a look.
I'm,

1387
01:26:50.810 --> 01:26:51.950
I'm not fucking into it.

1388
01:26:51.960 --> 01:26:56.630
And then walk away and don't even let it like consume your life to the point we

1389
01:26:56.631 --> 01:27:01.160
actually go out and you talk to your friends about it because you just wasted

1390
01:27:01.161 --> 01:27:05.780
energy should be out there talking to some other girl.
Hey,
go fuck that girl.

1391
01:27:06.760 --> 01:27:10.670
Fuck her and fuck fucker fucking concert.
You did the right God damn thing.
Um,

1392
01:27:11.720 --> 01:27:13.910
by the way,
let me get to the questions for this week as somebody,

1393
01:27:13.970 --> 01:27:16.490
I might as well do that because this will actually make it flow a little more

1394
01:27:16.670 --> 01:27:19.130
cause somebody,
uh,
um,

1395
01:27:21.230 --> 01:27:22.130
somebody said,
okay,
bill,

1396
01:27:22.131 --> 01:27:26.540
I want to know your thoughts on the prick that deck Snookie at the end of last

1397
01:27:26.540 --> 01:27:28.370
week's episode.
But uh,

1398
01:27:28.371 --> 01:27:33.371
I also have to get your take on Mike Aka the situation and his buddies attempts

1399
01:27:34.370 --> 01:27:37.530
to get laid hilarious.
Uh,

1400
01:27:39.650 --> 01:27:43.790
dude,
his buddy is getting all the fucking ass on the planet.
Mike,
the situation,

1401
01:27:44.150 --> 01:27:46.580
I dunno,
he,
he,

1402
01:27:46.581 --> 01:27:50.330
he's not a closer and he's really good at getting the appointments,

1403
01:27:50.331 --> 01:27:55.130
but he's not a fucking closer and uh,

1404
01:27:55.510 --> 01:28:00.020
he's,
he's like,
he wants to be the other dude,
but he's not the other dude.

1405
01:28:00.750 --> 01:28:01.820
He's got it down.

1406
01:28:02.020 --> 01:28:04.100
If every time he goes out the club he's making out with some girl,

1407
01:28:04.101 --> 01:28:06.740
he's grabbing her fucking tased,
that bringing girls back.

1408
01:28:06.741 --> 01:28:09.440
They see them on the street.
That guy,
I'm telling you,
the guy is a fucking,

1409
01:28:11.210 --> 01:28:14.840
you know,
I had fun.
I don't even think I have gained like that now.

1410
01:28:14.841 --> 01:28:16.980
Even if I could go back when all this shit I know now.

1411
01:28:17.080 --> 01:28:20.390
If I went back I wouldn't be as good.
That fucking kid.
He's the shit that kids,

1412
01:28:21.200 --> 01:28:24.140
Shit Mike,
this situation,
that situation Mike is,

1413
01:28:24.350 --> 01:28:26.150
you can't close the fucking deal.

1414
01:28:26.480 --> 01:28:30.080
And as far as the dude who punched deck Snookie Eh,
that was,
it was brutal.

1415
01:28:30.590 --> 01:28:34.820
I know.
I made fun of that girl with the legs sweep.
She fell down.
She was like,

1416
01:28:34.821 --> 01:28:39.320
oh my God.
It was funny.
That girl Snooky was like,
was sobbing.

1417
01:28:39.920 --> 01:28:44.810
I felt horrible.
I felt really bad for her.
And that guy is a fucking animal who,

1418
01:28:45.440 --> 01:28:48.440
um,
they should treat them like a pit bull.
They should,
you know,

1419
01:28:48.730 --> 01:28:51.130
pit bull bites somebody to take him down the fucking street and they put them

1420
01:28:51.131 --> 01:28:53.150
out of his misery.
That's what they should do with that guy.

1421
01:28:53.660 --> 01:28:54.493
They should take them.

1422
01:28:54.740 --> 01:28:58.310
They should literally take them to an animal shelter to not even a place for

1423
01:28:58.311 --> 01:29:00.590
humans and just,
you know,
lay him on the table,

1424
01:29:02.550 --> 01:29:06.600
have a muzzle on his face.
I like how we tried to,
I forget the guy's name,

1425
01:29:06.601 --> 01:29:11.160
but like say whatever his name is,
Mike Johnson or something.
He's like,
you know,

1426
01:29:11.250 --> 01:29:12.420
that's not the way I was raised.

1427
01:29:12.421 --> 01:29:16.680
What you saw in that video is not the real Mike Johnson.
Yeah,
it is.
It is.

1428
01:29:16.681 --> 01:29:21.510
That is you.
That is you.
That is you and you're drunk.
I'm sorry.

1429
01:29:21.540 --> 01:29:24.900
That's you.
That's a,
that's a part of you.
You fucking asshole.

1430
01:29:25.170 --> 01:29:27.510
I like those people.
They try to blame the alcohol.

1431
01:29:27.930 --> 01:29:32.280
Like if they say something racist or they fucking blast some girl in the face

1432
01:29:32.281 --> 01:29:35.730
and then try it.
That's not the real me.
You know,
I got this problem.

1433
01:29:35.880 --> 01:29:39.420
I drink alcohol and I become this different per fuck you now.

1434
01:29:39.421 --> 01:29:40.590
You doubt your doubt.

1435
01:29:43.040 --> 01:29:45.720
You know a drunk man's words are a sober man's thoughts.

1436
01:29:45.870 --> 01:29:49.620
It's one of the greatest fucking quotes ever.
You don't become somebody else.

1437
01:29:50.130 --> 01:29:53.550
You know,
maybe your,
your,
your,
you have a shorter fucking temper,

1438
01:29:53.760 --> 01:29:58.440
but there's no fucking way that guys never punched a girl in the face ever.

1439
01:29:59.580 --> 01:30:03.960
He wasn't even that drunk.
It wasn't like he was falling down drunk.

1440
01:30:04.200 --> 01:30:08.870
I think when she called him ugly,
I think that really touched in on some,
uh,

1441
01:30:08.970 --> 01:30:12.150
childhood shit because the dude is ugly and you know,

1442
01:30:12.151 --> 01:30:15.810
he lifted a bunch of weights trying to be like,
no,
don't look at the face.

1443
01:30:15.811 --> 01:30:19.590
Look down here.
This looks good.
Right?
I think she tapped in on some shit.

1444
01:30:20.850 --> 01:30:21.683
Um,

1445
01:30:22.440 --> 01:30:26.340
but that was the classic situation of a woman just not feeling like she's ever

1446
01:30:26.490 --> 01:30:31.140
going to get hit because I would never stand up on a bar stool.
I mean,

1447
01:30:31.141 --> 01:30:33.390
talk about a horrible way to begin to fight.

1448
01:30:33.720 --> 01:30:36.900
I'm going to stand up on a bar stool with my feet,
you know,
instead of,
you know,

1449
01:30:36.901 --> 01:30:39.780
that little thing.
So your feet don't dangle,
you know that part of the bar stool.

1450
01:30:40.020 --> 01:30:44.490
She was standing on that and then she leans over and I'm gonna lead with my
chin.

1451
01:30:45.180 --> 01:30:47.870
Hey,
you ugly motherfucker.
You know,

1452
01:30:51.650 --> 01:30:56.620
ah,
terrible move on her part.
He just fucking,
it was a straight left fire.

1453
01:30:56.640 --> 01:30:57.720
If I remember correctly,

1454
01:30:58.410 --> 01:31:02.010
you guys ever watched when we were at King's and Ali was hitting a George

1455
01:31:02.010 --> 01:31:05.060
Foreman with the straight right.
The one punch.
He wasn't ready for it.

1456
01:31:05.070 --> 01:31:09.180
He was doing it as a south paw.
Oh Man.
He,
yeah,
that was,

1457
01:31:09.240 --> 01:31:12.720
that was like a loose some fillings that was like blunt.

1458
01:31:13.290 --> 01:31:16.410
I thought it was horrible.
I didn't think it was funny at all.
And uh,

1459
01:31:16.710 --> 01:31:20.910
that guy should be prosecuted to the full extent of the law and uh,

1460
01:31:21.090 --> 01:31:22.800
he shouldn't put the guy down,
but you know,
she's doing,

1461
01:31:22.980 --> 01:31:24.660
he should have him out in the backyard,
you know,

1462
01:31:24.770 --> 01:31:27.780
like you do with those dogs where you have them on that wire and you have the

1463
01:31:27.781 --> 01:31:31.740
leash attached to it,
you know,
and then ugly girls,
I'm not ugly girls.

1464
01:31:31.741 --> 01:31:34.320
Girls should be yelling over the fence telling them how they ugly and you know,

1465
01:31:34.360 --> 01:31:38.760
your mother fucker then is he runs the lease just fucking yanks his neck and his

1466
01:31:38.761 --> 01:31:43.140
feet go flying out from underneath him.
He should do that for a month.
Um,

1467
01:31:44.130 --> 01:31:46.530
yeah.
So there you go.
All right,
next question bill.

1468
01:31:46.560 --> 01:31:50.340
I just started listening to your podcast and it was one,
oh,

1469
01:31:50.341 --> 01:31:51.240
this is a great question.

1470
01:31:51.570 --> 01:31:55.140
I was wondering if you ever look at a funeral procession,

1471
01:31:55.910 --> 01:31:57.920
if you have a look at funeral processions,
um,

1472
01:31:57.960 --> 01:32:02.960
I try and catch in the cars that don't care about the dead guy in front of them,

1473
01:32:03.700 --> 01:32:07.330
in the hearse and notice that the car,
uh,

1474
01:32:07.331 --> 01:32:10.810
and try to notice that car full of people laughing.
Do you ever do this?

1475
01:32:11.660 --> 01:32:14.740
And when are you coming back to the Boston area?
Uh,

1476
01:32:14.770 --> 01:32:16.510
well I'm just booking my 2010 now,

1477
01:32:16.511 --> 01:32:20.860
so I'll be coming back next year at some point.
Um,
absolutely.
I always do that.

1478
01:32:20.861 --> 01:32:24.400
There's always a,
uh,
um,

1479
01:32:25.570 --> 01:32:26.403
what is that

1480
01:32:27.610 --> 01:32:32.610
morbid curiosity to try to figure out which car has the people who were directly

1481
01:32:33.101 --> 01:32:36.260
related who gives the fuck the most?
Yeah.
And,

1482
01:32:36.400 --> 01:32:39.550
and as a funeral procession goes down and down and down and down,

1483
01:32:39.551 --> 01:32:41.170
it starts becoming third cousins.

1484
01:32:41.250 --> 01:32:44.020
As someone who worked with the guy back in the 60s.
Yeah.

1485
01:32:45.160 --> 01:32:46.450
By the time you get to the back.
Yeah.

1486
01:32:46.451 --> 01:32:49.840
There's like people watching DVDs in the head rests,
you know,

1487
01:32:50.470 --> 01:32:53.630
drinking Margaritas.
I definitely do that shit.
Um,

1488
01:32:53.631 --> 01:32:56.290
and I'm glad you asked that question cause I really thought I was the only

1489
01:32:56.291 --> 01:33:00.700
fucking person who doesn't.
Um,
all right,
I got to wrap up this podcast here.

1490
01:33:00.700 --> 01:33:03.880
It's going to be a little quick.
People just,
no,
it isn't 46 minutes in.

1491
01:33:03.910 --> 01:33:07.990
Look at me.
Look at fucking me.
Let me read a couple of things here.

1492
01:33:07.991 --> 01:33:11.950
Here's a kisser quote I read.
Somebody said to me about the press,

1493
01:33:12.490 --> 01:33:17.320
listen to this shit is a little conspiracy kind of shit.
Uh,
John Swinton,

1494
01:33:17.321 --> 01:33:21.160
the former chief of staff for the New York Times was asked to give a toast to

1495
01:33:21.161 --> 01:33:25.090
the independent press before the New York Press Club.
Um,

1496
01:33:25.790 --> 01:33:29.680
and it's obvious that he believed that the comps concept of an independent press

1497
01:33:29.980 --> 01:33:34.980
was a farce that he no longer wished to be a party to the following is reported

1498
01:33:34.991 --> 01:33:38.800
to be a quote from is monumentally revealing toast.

1499
01:33:40.180 --> 01:33:44.470
Um,
all right,
so this is basically a reported quote.
No one can even confirm this.

1500
01:33:44.610 --> 01:33:47.950
Got To love the Internet.
This is what the guy says about the independent press.

1501
01:33:48.550 --> 01:33:52.870
Uh,
there is no such thing at this state of the world's history in America,

1502
01:33:53.980 --> 01:33:56.290
uh,
of an independent press.
You know it.

1503
01:33:56.291 --> 01:33:59.860
And I know there is not one of you who dares to write your honest opinions.

1504
01:33:59.861 --> 01:34:03.730
And if you did,
you know beforehand that it would never appear in print.

1505
01:34:03.940 --> 01:34:07.840
I am paid weekly for keeping my honest opinion out of the pie out of the paper.

1506
01:34:08.350 --> 01:34:13.350
Others of you are paid similar salaries of similar things for similar things.

1507
01:34:14.050 --> 01:34:17.410
And any of you who would be so foolish as to write your own,
he's honest.

1508
01:34:17.411 --> 01:34:22.090
Opinions would be out on the streets looking for another job.
If I was,
if,

1509
01:34:22.240 --> 01:34:26.980
if I allowed my honest opinions to appear in one issue of the paper before 24

1510
01:34:26.981 --> 01:34:28.930
hours,
my occupation would be gone.

1511
01:34:29.170 --> 01:34:33.970
The business of journalism is to destroy the truth,
to lie outright,
to pervert,

1512
01:34:34.000 --> 01:34:37.960
to vilify,
to fun,
and at the feet of Mammon,

1513
01:34:38.020 --> 01:34:39.100
I don't know what the fuck that means.

1514
01:34:39.370 --> 01:34:44.290
And to sell this country and his race for his daily bread.
You know,
at nine,

1515
01:34:44.620 --> 01:34:46.090
knowing what folly this is,

1516
01:34:46.091 --> 01:34:51.091
toasting to an into print independent press are the tools and vassal of rich

1517
01:34:51.221 --> 01:34:56.020
people are rich men.
I what that was supposed to say,
vessel behind the scenes,

1518
01:34:56.021 --> 01:34:59.450
we are jumping jacks.
They pull the strings and we dance our talents.

1519
01:35:00.080 --> 01:35:03.980
Our possibilities in our lives are all the property of other men.

1520
01:35:04.310 --> 01:35:07.670
We are intellectual prostitutes.
You know,

1521
01:35:07.700 --> 01:35:11.240
can't you just see Michael Douglas giving that speech in one final effort to win

1522
01:35:11.241 --> 01:35:15.680
an Oscar in some melodramatic movie that Oprah would fucking recommend?

1523
01:35:16.160 --> 01:35:19.220
You have to see this movie.
It's so important.
Excuse me,

1524
01:35:19.370 --> 01:35:22.520
I'm going to eat another glazed pork chop.
Um,

1525
01:35:23.790 --> 01:35:26.480
all right.
That might that I think it might be the podcast this week.

1526
01:35:26.481 --> 01:35:28.340
I'm trying to get to one other thing here.
Once again,

1527
01:35:28.341 --> 01:35:31.760
I want to thank everybody who came out to my special.
I'm so fucking proud of it.

1528
01:35:32.810 --> 01:35:37.000
Um,
I really,
really think I got a good one.
And um,

1529
01:35:37.780 --> 01:35:41.150
I'm trying to chill out.
I'm chilling out.

1530
01:35:41.720 --> 01:35:45.050
I'm actually taking a vacation here until January 15th.

1531
01:35:45.051 --> 01:35:48.550
That's how fucking lawn I'm off.
I went to stubhub.

1532
01:35:48.920 --> 01:35:52.850
I got my Rosebowl tickets,
me and Joe Barton Nica going again this year.

1533
01:35:53.600 --> 01:35:56.390
I got a little place out here where I know I can get a couple of,

1534
01:35:56.391 --> 01:36:01.391
you know what a couple of Stovies of the a Desi Arnaz variety,

1535
01:36:03.020 --> 01:36:07.490
if you know what I mean.
And uh,
you know,

1536
01:36:07.550 --> 01:36:10.130
the ducks first the bucks,
we're going to go see that shit.

1537
01:36:10.131 --> 01:36:12.980
I'm actually toying with maybe going to the bcs game,

1538
01:36:12.981 --> 01:36:17.210
but they want so much fucking money,
but uh,
it's right up the fucking street.

1539
01:36:17.211 --> 01:36:20.060
How do you not go?
So a,
you should be asking yourself,
Bill,

1540
01:36:20.061 --> 01:36:22.790
what are you gonna be doing during the break?
Absolutely fucking nothing.

1541
01:36:23.700 --> 01:36:28.460
Can I get over this cough?
I'm going to try to work out a little bit.
And,
uh,

1542
01:36:29.600 --> 01:36:34.250
I've been playing my guitar.
I have a new guitar hero,
uh,
Duane Allman.

1543
01:36:35.050 --> 01:36:35.540
You know,

1544
01:36:35.540 --> 01:36:38.240
I used to listen to the almond brothers and shit when it came on the radio.

1545
01:36:38.241 --> 01:36:40.190
And I used to work in the warehouses back in the day,

1546
01:36:40.191 --> 01:36:42.800
but I didn't have an appreciation to what I was listening to.

1547
01:36:42.801 --> 01:36:46.190
And Duane Allman and Dickey Betts have become,
uh,

1548
01:36:47.000 --> 01:36:50.210
like I am downloading everything they've ever been on.

1549
01:36:51.050 --> 01:36:52.220
And uh,

1550
01:36:52.280 --> 01:36:57.260
and now totally fascinated with the fact that Duane almond used to,

1551
01:36:57.480 --> 01:37:01.700
it sounds like he would just show up at studios in play on other people's albums

1552
01:37:01.701 --> 01:37:05.120
and not even be credited.
So they actually saying like,

1553
01:37:05.121 --> 01:37:07.970
you don't even really know,
you know,

1554
01:37:09.260 --> 01:37:10.850
how much work that the guy did.
I don't know.

1555
01:37:10.851 --> 01:37:12.650
He just fucking seemed like he loved playing.

1556
01:37:12.890 --> 01:37:15.080
You know what's amazing about Duane Allman and as you look at the guy,

1557
01:37:15.260 --> 01:37:17.930
he looks like he's fucking 37 years old.

1558
01:37:18.680 --> 01:37:22.520
I don't know what it was about people back in the day.
They just looked old,

1559
01:37:23.390 --> 01:37:26.310
you know?
I mean it probably doesn't do it.

1560
01:37:26.330 --> 01:37:30.870
That's the guy from truth and salvage company.
That's the fucking beard mustache.

1561
01:37:30.871 --> 01:37:35.870
She has,
I was saying,
you lyses s grant,
it's via Duane Allman.

1562
01:37:35.871 --> 01:37:39.620
It's that fucking Elvis Presley mutton shop thing.

1563
01:37:40.220 --> 01:37:43.910
And right as it goes to your Chin where it'd be this big Grizzly Adam Beard,

1564
01:37:44.060 --> 01:37:48.950
you just hook it right up.
It makes a u turn right around your mouth.
Like,
it's,

1565
01:37:49.010 --> 01:37:52.430
it's then going to go around and go back up.
You same cheekbone,
but it doesn't,

1566
01:37:53.350 --> 01:37:53.660
it go,

1567
01:37:53.660 --> 01:37:56.670
it's like almost like it pulls into the gas station underneath your nose and

1568
01:37:56.671 --> 01:38:00.630
then goes right back up.
He goes right up to your other ear.
Um,

1569
01:38:02.340 --> 01:38:03.720
I was with someone yesterday.
I went to go,

1570
01:38:03.721 --> 01:38:06.510
I went to go buy that live at the Fillmore east album,
uh,

1571
01:38:06.511 --> 01:38:11.070
on record and uh,
and I was going to look at it,
look at that guy.

1572
01:38:11.100 --> 01:38:13.260
That's Dwayne Omega.
How old do you think he is?
And he's like,
I don't know,

1573
01:38:13.990 --> 01:38:16.230
mid thirties.
And I'm like,
the guy died it fucking 24.

1574
01:38:16.470 --> 01:38:19.470
I think maybe he was almost 25.
But uh,
anyways,

1575
01:38:19.680 --> 01:38:23.610
there's a clip actually on youtube if you want to see you look up the almond

1576
01:38:23.611 --> 01:38:28.350
brothers.
I can't remember the uh,
oh wait a minute.

1577
01:38:28.380 --> 01:38:32.280
I hang on a second.
I got to get you,
I've got to get you this.
There's one with,

1578
01:38:32.400 --> 01:38:37.400
they play on the tonight show where it's still Johnny Carson and you want to

1579
01:38:38.191 --> 01:38:40.200
talk about unbelievable musicians first of all,

1580
01:38:40.201 --> 01:38:43.410
the tonight show band with doc cybereason's in all of those guy,

1581
01:38:43.440 --> 01:38:48.030
unbelievable players.
So they come out and the almond brothers play one of their,

1582
01:38:48.031 --> 01:38:50.280
you know,
they have blues rock things.

1583
01:38:50.281 --> 01:38:55.230
Absolutely rip it up and then you know,
they play for like five minutes.

1584
01:38:55.231 --> 01:38:57.340
And then when they'd done Johnny's like,
all right,
we're going to do something.

1585
01:38:57.341 --> 01:38:59.730
A little different.
Docs going to come out and play with the band.

1586
01:38:59.970 --> 01:39:02.130
Then they did like this tribute to Charley Parker.

1587
01:39:02.131 --> 01:39:06.300
Like there's jazz thing and they just stay one right there with doc and all

1588
01:39:06.301 --> 01:39:09.210
those.
All the fucking tonight show guys.
It was,
it was unbelievable.

1589
01:39:09.660 --> 01:39:14.250
So I'm just look up the almond brothers tonight show.
Fuck.

1590
01:39:14.280 --> 01:39:15.113
Sorry.

1591
01:39:15.960 --> 01:39:20.850
But if you're not into that and you want to watch bill Graham yell at somebody.

1592
01:39:21.170 --> 01:39:26.070
I got,
I got to bring this up for you.
I'm sorry man.
Hang on a second.
It's a,

1593
01:39:26.400 --> 01:39:28.310
you just search,
uh,

1594
01:39:33.360 --> 01:39:38.190
Fillmore last days.
Let me see if I can find it.
Here you go.
Oh yeah.
All right.

1595
01:39:38.220 --> 01:39:42.660
Just search
Fillmore.
The last days,

1596
01:39:43.480 --> 01:39:47.250
search this and me and my girlfriend always make fun of how like hippies talked

1597
01:39:47.580 --> 01:39:52.560
in the 60s the way they said,
man,
they say it was almost like m y a n like,

1598
01:39:52.561 --> 01:39:56.400
hey me and not trying to get hassled me in.

1599
01:39:56.640 --> 01:39:59.400
So basically this,
this fucking video,

1600
01:39:59.490 --> 01:40:02.820
it's Bill Graham getting ready to do the last show at the Fillmore West,

1601
01:40:02.821 --> 01:40:04.230
the one down on market street.

1602
01:40:05.040 --> 01:40:10.040
And he decided that he was going to have all just San Francisco bands and a,

1603
01:40:10.141 --> 01:40:11.460
so this guy comes in,

1604
01:40:11.461 --> 01:40:16.461
he's a member of this band that doesn't get to be put on the bill and he's upset

1605
01:40:17.131 --> 01:40:18.300
with Bill Graham and he's,

1606
01:40:18.301 --> 01:40:23.301
he's trying to get on the fucking show and Bill Graham won't put them on and

1607
01:40:24.481 --> 01:40:27.330
they ended up having this fucking argument.
Let me see if I can get to it here.

1608
01:40:27.490 --> 01:40:31.620
Of course they're not going to show it.
And he's just like,
you know,
man,

1609
01:40:31.650 --> 01:40:34.670
it's like,
I can dig it man.
It's just like,
you know,
I mean,

1610
01:40:34.671 --> 01:40:39.400
we're selling more tickets than they are man.
And it's just like,
you know,
I mean,

1611
01:40:39.401 --> 01:40:41.180
it's just like far out me and,

1612
01:40:41.240 --> 01:40:46.240
and it ends up escalating to the point and Bill Graham's being like totally

1613
01:40:46.651 --> 01:40:49.260
legitimate.
He goes,
well,
you should just respect that I'm being honest with you,

1614
01:40:50.310 --> 01:40:51.143
man to man.

1615
01:40:51.150 --> 01:40:56.150
And it escalates to the point where Bill Graham is not budging and this guy has

1616
01:40:56.411 --> 01:40:59.620
no other argument and he makes the worst fucking decision he can make,

1617
01:40:59.621 --> 01:41:02.500
which is basically tells bill Graham to go fuck himself.

1618
01:41:02.950 --> 01:41:05.950
Not knowing that Bill Graham evidently had a big time temper,

1619
01:41:06.160 --> 01:41:10.040
had fought in Korea and is an absolute psycho.
Um,

1620
01:41:10.090 --> 01:41:14.500
if you just want to watch bill Graham chase a hippy out of the Fillmore West,

1621
01:41:14.600 --> 01:41:18.940
you got to watch this thing.
It's fucking hilarious.
Um,
it's a little bit long.

1622
01:41:18.941 --> 01:41:22.060
If you're not into the beginning,
just skip to it.
You'll see it's a guy comes in,

1623
01:41:22.061 --> 01:41:26.650
he's wearing like the rob Helford leather hat.
Uh,
but anyways,
that is it.

1624
01:41:26.651 --> 01:41:30.550
That's the podcast for this week.
Merry Christmas to everybody.
Happy Kwanzaa.

1625
01:41:30.551 --> 01:41:35.020
Happy Hanukkah.
Happy New Year.
Happy fucking end to 2009.

1626

1627

1629

everybody,
the management,
parents and everything.

1632
01:41:52.361 --> 01:41:54.190
I feel like I'm accepted an Oscar,

1633
01:41:54.191 --> 01:41:57.310
but I feel like I won one because it went that great.
So that's it.

1634
01:41:57.311 --> 01:42:00.160
Everybody have a great week and I will talk to you next Monday.
