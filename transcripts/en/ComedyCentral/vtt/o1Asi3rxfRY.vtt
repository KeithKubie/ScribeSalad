Amy, a high
school graduate,

00:00:07.574 --> 00:00:09.142
is ready to change her
relationship status

00:00:09.209 --> 00:00:10.878
with her boyfriend,
Nick.

00:00:10.944 --> 00:00:11.879
Hello, gorgeous.

00:00:11.945 --> 00:00:13.180
Are you my
breakup girl?

00:00:13.247 --> 00:00:14.381
Yes, hi.

00:00:14.448 --> 00:00:15.749
Hi, come here.

Nick and I have been dating
for two-and-a-half years.

00:00:17.784 --> 00:00:21.355
Nick is like, such
a great guy, but I just,

00:00:21.421 --> 00:00:25.259
I know in my heart that I'm
ready for something taller.

00:00:27.227 --> 00:00:28.662
So let's
talk general concept.

Have we given any thought to
whether you want it to be

00:00:31.265 --> 00:00:33.934 line:0%
 
a slow realization
or a devastating blindside?

00:00:34.001 --> 00:00:37.938 line:0%
 
Um, I guess
blindside feels more me.

00:00:38.005 --> 00:00:39.006
You know what?

00:00:39.072 --> 00:00:40.574
I knew you were going
to say that.

00:00:40.641 --> 00:00:41.909
I just get you.
You do.

00:00:41.975 --> 00:00:43.911
Let's look at
some venues, come on.

00:00:43.977 --> 00:00:44.912
You know what?

00:00:44.978 --> 00:00:45.913
I have an idea, Amy.

00:00:45.979 --> 00:00:47.748
Let me tell you.

00:00:47.814 --> 00:00:49.917
What do you
think about tapas?

00:00:49.983 --> 00:00:51.518
I love the small
plates idea.

00:00:51.585 --> 00:00:52.953
I think it's
a great fit for you, Amy.

00:00:53.020 --> 00:00:55.155
You know, it's low commitment,
you can leave after

00:00:55.222 --> 00:00:57.257
the bacon-wrapped figs
if you want, or if he's crying,

00:00:57.324 --> 00:00:58.859
you can stay for
the croquettas!

00:00:58.926 --> 00:01:00.460
Ooh, I love
croquettas!

00:01:00.527 --> 00:01:02.930
Then we're gonna have
to make him cry.

00:01:03.063 --> 00:01:03.931
You're such a natural.

00:01:04.064 --> 00:01:04.932
Have you done
this before?

00:01:05.065 --> 00:01:06.400
No. No.

00:01:06.466 --> 00:01:08.068
Everyone always
breaks up with me.

00:01:10.070 --> 00:01:11.205

Why are you being mean?

00:01:44.404 --> 00:01:46.139

I watched my friends
do this over and over again

00:02:01.054 --> 00:02:02.456
and now it's my turn.

Nick,

the times we shared can never

What are you
guys shooting?

But all things must run their
course and in due time,

even everything ends.

00:02:28.315 --> 00:02:32.853
So Nick, today, I'd like
to tell you that

00:02:32.920 --> 00:02:37.191
I am breaking up with you.

00:02:37.257 --> 00:02:38.325

00:03:02.449 --> 00:03:04.051
But if I want to hear you sing,
I will put a dollar

in your (bleep) sombrero.

This is not the

Please just
follow instructions.
