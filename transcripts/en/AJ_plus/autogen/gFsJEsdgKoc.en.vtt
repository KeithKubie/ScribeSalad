00:00:00.310 --> 00:00:02.720
- A network of
volunteers in Phoenix, Arizona

00:00:02.720 --> 00:00:04.270
has mobilized to help migrants

00:00:04.270 --> 00:00:07.120
once they're released from
ICE detention centers.

00:00:07.120 --> 00:00:09.460
But they have been
forced to go underground

00:00:09.460 --> 00:00:11.610
because they've been
targeted by armed protesters

00:00:11.610 --> 00:00:14.560
critical of their work. Regardless,

00:00:14.560 --> 00:00:16.160
they are determined to help migrants

00:00:16.160 --> 00:00:18.012
dropped off in their city.

00:00:18.012 --> 00:00:20.991
- Every day I get a text message

00:00:20.991 --> 00:00:22.431
from my ICE contact.

00:00:22.431 --> 00:00:24.572
She will let me know how many people,

00:00:24.572 --> 00:00:26.990
what hours, and the location that

00:00:26.990 --> 00:00:27.823
they'll be dropped at.

00:00:27.823 --> 00:00:29.220
- We created this amazing system

00:00:29.220 --> 00:00:30.708
where everything was put in place.

00:00:30.708 --> 00:00:33.088
- We provide a place where people can

00:00:33.088 --> 00:00:35.180
rest, eat, sleep.

00:00:35.180 --> 00:00:38.130
- Set up our little pop-up pharmacy.

00:00:38.130 --> 00:00:39.548
- Prepaid phone kits.

00:00:39.548 --> 00:00:40.770
- Somebody needs drivers or we need

00:00:40.770 --> 00:00:41.890
more volunteers (snaps fingers)

00:00:41.890 --> 00:00:43.351
we radically mobilize.

00:00:43.351 --> 00:00:46.101
(snapping music)

00:00:48.160 --> 00:00:49.840
- [Narrator] Volunteers
adapt to the government's

00:00:49.840 --> 00:00:52.180
constantly changing immigration protocols.

00:00:52.180 --> 00:00:54.910
They provide food,
lodging, medical support,

00:00:54.910 --> 00:00:56.980
showers, clothing, cellphones and

00:00:56.980 --> 00:00:58.730
transportation for migrants.

00:00:58.730 --> 00:01:00.220
And they do it without any government

00:01:00.220 --> 00:01:01.343
funding or support.

00:01:02.330 --> 00:01:04.287
- We have an incredible
group of volunteers.

00:01:04.287 --> 00:01:07.029
I mean, there are over 500 people who are

00:01:07.029 --> 00:01:08.330
chomping at the bit to be involved.

00:01:08.330 --> 00:01:09.751
- We do this because we love it.

00:01:09.751 --> 00:01:11.391
But we were putting a Band-aid

00:01:11.391 --> 00:01:12.510
on what the government was doing.

00:01:12.510 --> 00:01:14.970
- Every time we make adjustments

00:01:14.970 --> 00:01:17.700
to accommodate, however,
ICE and Border Patrol

00:01:17.700 --> 00:01:19.560
are choosing to process people.

00:01:19.560 --> 00:01:21.469
The goalposts just keep moving.

00:01:21.469 --> 00:01:25.180
- We will just get our hands on managing

00:01:25.180 --> 00:01:27.900
200 people a day, and then all of a sudden

00:01:27.900 --> 00:01:30.610
we're told that the
numbers are going to jump.

00:01:30.610 --> 00:01:33.670
- [Narrator] Over 25,000
migrants have been released

00:01:33.670 --> 00:01:37.180
by ICE in Phoenix
in the past four months.

00:01:37.180 --> 00:01:39.770
Some days, more than 300 people are

00:01:39.770 --> 00:01:41.530
dropped off at local churches.

00:01:41.530 --> 00:01:43.800
But when those are full or unavailable,

00:01:43.800 --> 00:01:46.313
they're left outside this
Greyhound bus station.

00:01:47.394 --> 00:01:49.600
- On one hand, it's disheartening that

00:01:50.983 --> 00:01:53.731
we have to step in, but on the other hand,

00:01:53.731 --> 00:01:58.531
I am so moved by all of
the people that I've met.

00:01:58.531 --> 00:02:01.173
They are all people who
care about immigrants.

00:02:01.173 --> 00:02:02.480
- Food is love.

00:02:02.480 --> 00:02:04.470
You know, you feed somebody and you

00:02:04.470 --> 00:02:06.400
are telling them that you care about them.

00:02:06.400 --> 00:02:08.550
I called up all different kinds of people.

00:02:08.550 --> 00:02:10.040
I called up my Methodist friends,

00:02:10.040 --> 00:02:12.860
my Catholic friends, and my Sikh friends,

00:02:12.860 --> 00:02:15.960
and my Jain friends, and
my friends who are atheist

00:02:15.960 --> 00:02:18.630
and I said, 'This is a
humanitarian crisis.'

00:02:18.630 --> 00:02:20.610
Right now we're serving a meal to them

00:02:20.610 --> 00:02:22.800
and this is something that's important.

00:02:22.800 --> 00:02:24.530
And everyone started coming.

00:02:24.530 --> 00:02:25.750
- While many of the pop-up

00:02:25.750 --> 00:02:28.070
shelters are churches,
volunteers come from

00:02:28.070 --> 00:02:29.350
all walks of life.

00:02:29.350 --> 00:02:31.939
Some have immigration
stories of their own.

00:02:31.939 --> 00:02:33.099
- I'm a DACA recipient.

00:02:33.099 --> 00:02:35.539
I came here when I was four with my

00:02:35.539 --> 00:02:36.867
mom from Mexico.

00:02:36.867 --> 00:02:38.848
We actually crossed through Arizona

00:02:38.848 --> 00:02:40.784
and we were apprehended.

00:02:40.784 --> 00:02:43.296
We were actually in the detention center

00:02:43.296 --> 00:02:45.628
that a lot of families here have been in.

00:02:45.628 --> 00:02:47.481
To me, helping migrants is personal.

00:02:47.481 --> 00:02:50.237
It's returning the cycle
of where I came from.

00:02:50.237 --> 00:02:51.895
I see the ICE truck coming and

00:02:51.895 --> 00:02:53.847
I see people staggering out.

00:02:53.847 --> 00:02:55.108
They look so confused.

00:02:55.108 --> 00:02:56.567
And the first question he asked me is,

00:02:56.567 --> 00:02:59.156
'Where am I?' I said, 'You're in Arizona.'

00:02:59.156 --> 00:03:00.316
And I remember them telling us how

00:03:00.316 --> 00:03:03.316
cold it was. That awakened my memories.

00:03:03.316 --> 00:03:04.743
I was like, I have to step up,

00:03:04.743 --> 00:03:06.660
I have to do something.

00:03:07.580 --> 00:03:09.490
- I'm an immigrant originally from Syria.

00:03:09.490 --> 00:03:11.320
When I'm meeting people and we're

00:03:11.320 --> 00:03:13.450
working with them to get them situated,

00:03:13.450 --> 00:03:16.100
I see myself, I see my relatives,

00:03:16.100 --> 00:03:19.680
I see my friends and I
want to do better by them.

00:03:19.680 --> 00:03:21.870
I want this country to do better by them.

00:03:21.870 --> 00:03:24.540
Not being able to do anything about

00:03:24.540 --> 00:03:27.090
what was happening in Syria, but

00:03:27.090 --> 00:03:29.090
being able to do something here,

00:03:29.090 --> 00:03:32.410
just seeing the parallels and the journeys

00:03:32.410 --> 00:03:33.830
that people are facing.

00:03:33.830 --> 00:03:36.180
Migration is a human right and

00:03:36.180 --> 00:03:38.820
it's everybody right to flee to safety

00:03:38.820 --> 00:03:40.313
when they feel unsafe.

00:03:41.170 --> 00:03:42.410
- Arizona has a history of

00:03:42.410 --> 00:03:44.230
strict immigration policy.

00:03:44.230 --> 00:03:47.960
In 2010, the state passed S.B. 1070,

00:03:47.960 --> 00:03:49.780
which requires immigrants to have their

00:03:49.780 --> 00:03:52.470
immigration documents
on them at all times.

00:03:52.470 --> 00:03:54.380
It also required police to verify

00:03:54.380 --> 00:03:56.610
immigration status during lawful stops

00:03:56.610 --> 00:03:58.920
and detainments if there
was "reasonable suspicion"

00:03:58.920 --> 00:04:01.560
the person was in the country
without authorization.

00:04:02.444 --> 00:04:03.884
- I think that Arizona is

00:04:03.884 --> 00:04:05.516
looked at as the Wild West.

00:04:05.516 --> 00:04:08.824
You know, people see us as
gun-toting conservatives

00:04:08.824 --> 00:04:11.556
that are sort of anti-Brown people.

00:04:11.556 --> 00:04:13.316
- I grew up in LA and
I remember they would

00:04:13.316 --> 00:04:15.804
always tell you, 'Stay away from Arizona.

00:04:15.804 --> 00:04:18.745
Don't go to Arizona
because of the political

00:04:18.745 --> 00:04:21.396
atmosphere and the hateful rhetoric toward

00:04:21.396 --> 00:04:23.940
immigrants.' Arizona is
so much better than that.

00:04:23.940 --> 00:04:25.040
- Arizona also has a

00:04:25.040 --> 00:04:27.290
history of helping migrants, dating

00:04:27.290 --> 00:04:30.580
back to the Sanctuary
movement in the 1980s and '90s

00:04:30.580 --> 00:04:32.240
when an underground network of churches

00:04:32.240 --> 00:04:34.250
housed Central American immigrants fleeing

00:04:34.250 --> 00:04:36.660
from violence and oppression
in their home countries.

00:04:36.660 --> 00:04:40.484
Today, churches still lead
the movement to help migrants.

00:04:40.484 --> 00:04:42.985
- The Sanctuary movement started because

00:04:42.985 --> 00:04:45.902
the United States was refusing to allow

00:04:46.737 --> 00:04:48.625
people to make asylum claims.

00:04:48.625 --> 00:04:50.396
This is different because now we've got

00:04:50.396 --> 00:04:53.103
people that are being
allowed an asylum hearing.

00:04:53.103 --> 00:04:55.046
Border Control is sending them to ICE.

00:04:55.046 --> 00:04:57.726
Immigrations Custom Enforcement
is sending them to us.

00:04:57.726 --> 00:04:59.846
So what we're doing is perfectly legal.

00:04:59.846 --> 00:05:01.574
In fact, what we're doing is supporting

00:05:01.574 --> 00:05:04.094
the government rather than
thwarting the government.

00:05:04.094 --> 00:05:05.614
As we've done this work, there's a group

00:05:05.614 --> 00:05:08.813
of armed protesters that
shows up to churches.

00:05:08.813 --> 00:05:11.670
- Members of
the Patriot Movement AZ,

00:05:11.670 --> 00:05:13.760
a group that the Southern
Poverty Law Center

00:05:13.760 --> 00:05:16.070
classifies as a hate
group, has threatened,

00:05:16.070 --> 00:05:18.490
followed, and filmed
volunteers and migrants.

00:05:18.490 --> 00:05:20.960
In response, volunteers went underground,

00:05:20.960 --> 00:05:22.910
keeping names, locations and other

00:05:22.910 --> 00:05:25.084
details of their work secret.

00:05:25.084 --> 00:05:27.774
- We aren't able to use
the traditional route

00:05:27.774 --> 00:05:30.574
of crowdfunding or getting Facebook.

00:05:30.574 --> 00:05:33.436
If we do, then the Patriot movement

00:05:33.436 --> 00:05:34.269
shows up.

00:05:34.269 --> 00:05:36.110
- As the asylum refugees
were getting off the

00:05:36.110 --> 00:05:38.480
ICE bus, they had their phones out,

00:05:38.480 --> 00:05:39.860
they were taking photos of them.

00:05:39.860 --> 00:05:41.820
They were yelling at
them, 'You're murderers,

00:05:41.820 --> 00:05:43.010
you're rapists.' Things like that.

00:05:43.010 --> 00:05:44.974
None of these people are like that at all.

00:05:44.974 --> 00:05:45.934
- I get targeted.

00:05:45.934 --> 00:05:46.974
They'll put my name out and say,

00:05:46.974 --> 00:05:48.702
'This is a person who help migrants,

00:05:48.702 --> 00:05:50.817
another illegal helping illegals.'

00:05:50.817 --> 00:05:53.067
See these people coming in and telling me

00:05:53.067 --> 00:05:55.809
that something bad's gonna happen to me,

00:05:55.809 --> 00:05:58.176
following me, taking pictures of me,

00:05:58.176 --> 00:06:00.769
going up to me with weapons on hand.

00:06:00.769 --> 00:06:02.436
I'm not scared anymore.

00:06:02.436 --> 00:06:05.114
My ideology, my love is way stronger than

00:06:05.114 --> 00:06:07.737
whatever hateful rhetoric
they come at me with.

00:06:07.737 --> 00:06:09.457
- I worry that someone's going to get

00:06:09.457 --> 00:06:12.737
hurt because of the protesters.

00:06:12.737 --> 00:06:15.768
But ultimately, what keeps me going is

00:06:15.768 --> 00:06:18.038
knowing that we've got these moms

00:06:18.038 --> 00:06:20.605
and babies, dads that are protecting

00:06:20.605 --> 00:06:22.497
their little girls.

00:06:22.497 --> 00:06:24.410
- Migrant drop-offs
in Phoenix aren't new.

00:06:24.410 --> 00:06:25.970
Some volunteers have been coordinating

00:06:25.970 --> 00:06:28.670
drop-offs with ICE since 2013.

00:06:28.670 --> 00:06:30.540
But now, release procedures change

00:06:30.540 --> 00:06:31.530
more rapidly.

00:06:31.530 --> 00:06:33.850
In just the past few
weeks, ICE drastically

00:06:33.850 --> 00:06:35.740
reduced drop-offs in Phoenix only to

00:06:35.740 --> 00:06:38.480
increase drop-offs in Yuma, a border city.

00:06:38.480 --> 00:06:40.850
Yuma has since declared
a state of emergency

00:06:40.850 --> 00:06:43.080
due to the sudden influx of migrants.

00:06:43.080 --> 00:06:44.980
- The people who are helping are not the

00:06:44.980 --> 00:06:46.110
heroes of the story.

00:06:46.110 --> 00:06:47.720
The actual heroes are the people

00:06:47.720 --> 00:06:50.270
who are willing to
leave everything behind

00:06:50.270 --> 00:06:52.880
and take a risk and face danger so that

00:06:52.880 --> 00:06:55.860
they can have a safer
future for their children.

00:06:55.860 --> 00:06:58.530
And I really hope that
we can change policies

00:06:58.530 --> 00:07:01.120
so that nobody has to be dropped off.

00:07:01.120 --> 00:07:04.010
I think the goal of any group that

00:07:04.010 --> 00:07:06.170
comes together to serve others

00:07:06.170 --> 00:07:09.230
is to have an impact on policy so that

00:07:09.230 --> 00:07:10.930
their group doesn't have to exist.
