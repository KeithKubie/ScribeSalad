00:00:06.735 --> 00:00:10.151
One of the most amazing facts 
in physics is this:

00:00:10.151 --> 00:00:13.758
everything in the universe, from light
to electrons to atoms,

00:00:13.758 --> 00:00:18.343
behaves like both a particle and a wave
at the same time.

00:00:18.343 --> 00:00:21.625
All of the other weird stuff you might
have heard about quantum physics,

00:00:21.625 --> 00:00:26.549
Schrodinger's Cat, God playing dice,
spooky action at a distance,

00:00:26.549 --> 00:00:28.747
all of it follows directly from the fact

00:00:28.747 --> 00:00:33.361
that everything has both 
particle and wave nature.

00:00:33.361 --> 00:00:34.712
This might sound crazy.

00:00:34.712 --> 00:00:38.343
If you look around, you'll see waves
in water and particles of rock,

00:00:38.343 --> 00:00:39.758
and they're nothing alike.

00:00:39.758 --> 00:00:41.876
So why would you think to combine them?

00:00:41.876 --> 00:00:46.355
Physicists didn't just decide to mash
these things together out of no where.

00:00:46.355 --> 00:00:49.439
Rather, they were led to 
the dual nature of the universe

00:00:49.439 --> 00:00:51.887
through a process of small steps,

00:00:51.887 --> 00:00:56.131
fitting together lots of bits of evidence,
like pieces in a puzzle.

00:00:56.131 --> 00:01:00.372
The first person to seriously 
suggest the dual nature of light

00:01:00.372 --> 00:01:03.078
was Albert Einstein in 1905,

00:01:03.078 --> 00:01:06.651
but he was picking up an 
earlier idea from Max Planck.

00:01:06.651 --> 00:01:09.814
Planck explained the colors of light
emitted by hot objects,

00:01:09.814 --> 00:01:11.813
like the filament in a light bulb,

00:01:11.813 --> 00:01:14.264
but to do it, he needed a desperate trick:

00:01:14.264 --> 00:01:17.064
he said the object was 
made up of oscillators

00:01:17.064 --> 00:01:20.087
that could only emit light
in discrete chunks,

00:01:20.087 --> 00:01:23.550
units of energy that depend on 
the frequency of the light.

00:01:23.550 --> 00:01:28.334
Planck was never really happy with this,
but Einstein picked it up and ran with it.

00:01:28.334 --> 00:01:31.683
He applied Planck's idea to light itself,
saying that light,

00:01:31.683 --> 00:01:36.179
which everybody knew was a wave,
is really a stream of photons,

00:01:36.179 --> 00:01:38.569
each with a discrete amount of energy.

00:01:38.569 --> 00:01:43.997
Einstein himself called this
the only truly revolutionary thing he did,

00:01:43.997 --> 00:01:49.122
but it explains the way light shining on 
a metal surface knocks loose electrons.

00:01:49.122 --> 00:01:53.396
Even people who hated the idea
had to agree that it works brilliantly.

00:01:53.396 --> 00:01:57.158
The next puzzle piece came from 
Ernest Rutherford in England.

00:01:57.158 --> 00:02:01.990
In 1909, Ernest Marsden and Hans Geiger,
working for Rutherford,

00:02:01.990 --> 00:02:04.925
shot alpha particles at gold atoms

00:02:04.925 --> 00:02:08.983
and were stunned to find that some
bounced straight backwards.

00:02:08.983 --> 00:02:14.041
This showed that most of the mass of the 
atom is concentrated in a tiny nucleus.

00:02:14.041 --> 00:02:16.380
The cartoon atom you learn 
in grade school,

00:02:16.380 --> 00:02:19.381
with electrons orbiting
like a miniature solar system,

00:02:19.381 --> 00:02:21.261
that's Rutherford's.

00:02:21.261 --> 00:02:24.687
There's one little problem with
Rutherford's atom: it can't work.

00:02:24.687 --> 00:02:26.733
Classical physics tells us
that an electron

00:02:26.733 --> 00:02:29.163
whipping around in a circle emits light,

00:02:29.163 --> 00:02:33.072
and we use this all the time
to generate radio waves and X-rays.

00:02:33.072 --> 00:02:37.549
Rutherford's atoms should spray X-rays
in all directions for a brief instant

00:02:37.549 --> 00:02:41.136
before the electron spirals in
to crash into the nucleus.

00:02:41.136 --> 00:02:45.866
But Niels Bohr, a Danish theoretical
physicist working with Rutherford,

00:02:45.866 --> 00:02:48.481
pointed out that atoms obviously exist,

00:02:48.481 --> 00:02:51.210
so maybe the rules of physics 
needed to change.

00:02:51.210 --> 00:02:54.818
Bohr proposed that an electron
in certain special orbits

00:02:54.818 --> 00:02:57.484
doesn't emit any light at all.

00:02:57.484 --> 00:03:01.666
Atoms absorb and emit light
only when electrons change orbits,

00:03:01.666 --> 00:03:04.582
and the frequency of the light
depends on the energy difference

00:03:04.582 --> 00:03:08.752
in just the way Planck
and Einstein introduced.

00:03:08.752 --> 00:03:10.914
Bohr's atom fixes Rutherford's problem

00:03:10.914 --> 00:03:15.327
and explains why atoms emit only
very specific colors of light.

00:03:15.327 --> 00:03:17.454
Each element has its own special orbits,

00:03:17.454 --> 00:03:20.441
and thus its own unique
set of frequencies.

00:03:20.441 --> 00:03:22.829
The Bohr model has one tiny problem:

00:03:22.829 --> 00:03:25.741
there's no reason for 
those orbits to be special.

00:03:25.741 --> 00:03:28.631
But Louis de Broglie, 
a French PhD student,

00:03:28.631 --> 00:03:30.660
brought everything full circle.

00:03:30.660 --> 00:03:33.908
He pointed out that if light,
which everyone knew is a wave,

00:03:33.908 --> 00:03:35.483
behaves like a particle,

00:03:35.483 --> 00:03:38.695
maybe the electron, 
which everyone knew is a particle,

00:03:38.695 --> 00:03:40.835
behaves like a wave.

00:03:40.835 --> 00:03:42.538
And if electrons are waves,

00:03:42.538 --> 00:03:46.266
it's easy to explain Bohr's rule
for picking out the special orbits.

00:03:46.266 --> 00:03:49.360
Once you have the idea that 
electrons behave like waves,

00:03:49.360 --> 00:03:51.047
you can go look for it.

00:03:51.047 --> 00:03:54.406
And within a few years, 
scientists in the US and UK

00:03:54.406 --> 00:03:57.289
had observed wave behavior from electrons.

00:03:57.289 --> 00:04:00.487
These days we have a wonderfully clear
demonstration of this:

00:04:00.487 --> 00:04:04.637
shooting single electrons at a barrier
with slits cut in it.

00:04:04.637 --> 00:04:08.664
Each electron is detected 
at a specific place at a specific time,

00:04:08.664 --> 00:04:10.119
like a particle.

00:04:10.119 --> 00:04:12.307
But when you repeat the experiment
many times,

00:04:12.307 --> 00:04:16.582
all the individual electrons trace out
a pattern of stripes,

00:04:16.582 --> 00:04:18.902
characteristic of wave behavior.

00:04:18.902 --> 00:04:22.035
The idea that particles behave like waves,
and vice versa,

00:04:22.035 --> 00:04:25.738
is one of the strangest
and most powerful in physics.

00:04:25.738 --> 00:04:27.437
Richard Feynman famously said

00:04:27.437 --> 00:04:31.252
that this illustrates the central mystery
of quantum mechanics.

00:04:31.252 --> 00:04:33.307
Everything else follows from this,

00:04:33.307 --> 00:04:35.992
like pieces of a puzzle 
falling into place.
