00:00:00.120 --> 00:00:01.520
&gt;&gt; Hey guys. Grant popping in to remind you

00:00:01.520 --> 00:00:03.380
There's only one week left
to get your name on the list

00:00:03.389 --> 00:00:05.970
to win the Nintendo Switch and Mario Kart 8.

00:00:05.970 --> 00:00:07.439
This is going to one of you.

00:00:07.439 --> 00:00:08.670
So, click the link in the description.

00:00:08.670 --> 00:00:09.810
Make sure your name is on the list.

00:00:09.810 --> 00:00:10.380
See you there.

00:00:10.380 --> 00:00:13.060
&gt;&gt; Road flares have
oxidizers mixed in with them,

00:00:13.060 --> 00:00:16.260
which means they are supposed
to be able to burn even underwater.

00:00:16.260 --> 00:00:17.780
But we wanted to see what would happen

00:00:17.790 --> 00:00:19.420
if we burn it,
not just under water,

00:00:19.420 --> 00:00:21.080
but also in liquid nitrogen.

00:00:21.080 --> 00:00:23.060

00:00:23.060 --> 00:00:28.320
[Music]

00:00:28.320 --> 00:00:31.480
The basic idea is we'll test
the flare burning underwater

00:00:31.480 --> 00:00:33.390
by lighting one and submerging it.

00:00:33.390 --> 00:00:36.160
Then we'll move on to submerging
a lit flare in the same container

00:00:36.160 --> 00:00:37.520
full of liquid nitrogen.

00:00:37.520 --> 00:00:40.240
After that, we'll try putting
a flare down into the liquid nitrogen,

00:00:40.240 --> 00:00:40.980
unlit,

00:00:40.980 --> 00:00:44.800
letting it freeze solid,
and then see if it will light at that point.

00:00:44.800 --> 00:00:47.020
The manufacturer's instructions do say

00:00:47.020 --> 00:00:49.760
that these are tested
to burn vertically under water.

00:00:49.760 --> 00:00:52.220
But horizontally, the water can put them out.

00:00:52.220 --> 00:00:55.080
Our container is pretty much
the right shape for testing a vertical burn,

00:00:55.089 --> 00:00:56.629
so I'm hoping it works quite well.

00:00:56.629 --> 00:00:59.560
The cap on a flare comes with a striking tab.

00:00:59.560 --> 00:01:01.760
It's kind of the side on a box of matches.

00:01:01.760 --> 00:01:03.680
This little bead on
the front of the flare

00:01:03.680 --> 00:01:05.100
is like the head of a match.

00:01:05.100 --> 00:01:07.760
Striking the two together
should ignite the flare.

00:01:07.760 --> 00:01:10.620
[Music]

00:01:10.620 --> 00:01:14.780
These particular flares are
largely composed of Strontium Nitrate,

00:01:14.780 --> 00:01:17.160
Sulfur and Potassium Nitrate.

00:01:17.600 --> 00:01:20.460
Those chemicals help
give it the vibrant red color

00:01:20.460 --> 00:01:21.760
that we can see here.

00:01:22.180 --> 00:01:25.800
Let's see what happens if we take
a flare and submerge it in the water.

00:01:26.380 --> 00:01:27.000
Ready?

00:01:32.920 --> 00:01:34.480
[Music]

00:01:34.480 --> 00:01:36.100
That didn't look so waterproof to me.

00:01:36.100 --> 00:01:37.920
[Music]

00:01:37.920 --> 00:01:38.840
Didn't work at all.

00:01:38.840 --> 00:01:43.360
[Music]

00:01:43.360 --> 00:01:44.400
Where's the T-Rex?

00:01:44.800 --> 00:01:46.720
Over here, over here.

00:01:48.340 --> 00:01:49.220
[indiscernible screaming]

00:01:49.220 --> 00:01:50.520
Alright let's see if it works any better

00:01:50.520 --> 00:01:52.140
slightly earlier in its burn.

00:01:52.140 --> 00:02:05.680
[Music]

00:02:05.680 --> 00:02:10.259
Well it does keep burning,
but it looks like it may start dimming

00:02:10.259 --> 00:02:12.280
after it's in there for a couple seconds.

00:02:12.280 --> 00:02:18.160
[Music]

00:02:18.160 --> 00:02:19.060
Oh no.

00:02:19.540 --> 00:02:21.820
Well it's supposed
to stay lit under water,

00:02:21.820 --> 00:02:23.840
and we have mixed results with that.

00:02:24.140 --> 00:02:27.640
Right near the beginning,
it was pushing out with enough gas

00:02:27.640 --> 00:02:29.600
that it seemed to sort of keep burning.

00:02:29.600 --> 00:02:32.240
But this one after had been
burning for a couple of minutes,

00:02:32.250 --> 00:02:33.599
I tried putting it down to the water,

00:02:33.599 --> 00:02:34.950
and it did put it out.

00:02:34.950 --> 00:02:37.020
So let's find out if
we get a similar result,

00:02:37.020 --> 00:02:38.960
dipping a flare into liquid nitrogen.

00:02:38.960 --> 00:02:56.140
[Music]

00:02:56.140 --> 00:02:57.400
All right. Here it goes.

00:02:57.400 --> 00:02:59.240
Road flare in liquid nitrogen.

00:02:59.240 --> 00:03:05.260
[Music]

00:03:05.260 --> 00:03:07.620
Ah, our glass container.

00:03:07.620 --> 00:03:13.780
[Music]

00:03:13.780 --> 00:03:15.100
Well,

00:03:16.960 --> 00:03:18.680
I didn't see that coming.

00:03:18.680 --> 00:03:20.340
I guess maybe I should have,

00:03:21.380 --> 00:03:22.660
but I didn't.

00:03:22.660 --> 00:03:28.079
A little bit of burning flare
landed on the screen of my phone just now.

00:03:29.020 --> 00:03:32.880
And I now have a lovely dead spot on my screen.

00:03:32.880 --> 00:03:50.300
[Music]

00:03:50.300 --> 00:03:52.400
Well, it's still looks
like it's burning to me.

00:03:53.280 --> 00:03:56.120
It is discoloring
the liquid nitrogen somehow.

00:03:56.120 --> 00:04:04.540
[Music]

00:04:04.540 --> 00:04:08.520
I think its definitely making
the liquid nitrogen boil away faster.

00:04:08.520 --> 00:04:12.540
[Music]

00:04:12.540 --> 00:04:13.860
Still burning.

00:04:13.860 --> 00:04:15.360
[Music]

00:04:15.360 --> 00:04:16.040
Back in.

00:04:16.040 --> 00:04:22.400
[Music]

00:04:22.440 --> 00:04:24.080
I don't think it puts it out.

00:04:24.080 --> 00:04:25.560
We've got one more thing we want to try.

00:04:25.560 --> 00:04:27.180
And that's to freeze a road flare

00:04:27.180 --> 00:04:29.280
and then see what happens
when we try and light it.

00:04:29.520 --> 00:04:30.260
All right.

00:04:30.260 --> 00:04:33.380
Unlit road flare going
into our liquid nitrogen.

00:04:33.380 --> 00:04:37.720
[Music]

00:04:37.729 --> 00:04:39.330
The liquid nitrogen already in the cup

00:04:39.330 --> 00:04:42.509
has been discolored by
the flare that was dipped in it before.

00:04:42.509 --> 00:04:44.760
Normally of course, it's completely clear.

00:04:44.760 --> 00:04:47.819
But there have been some pollutants
from a road flare that have stained it,

00:04:47.820 --> 00:04:49.660
sort of a dark greenish color.

00:04:49.980 --> 00:04:52.260
This is like swamp liquid nitrogen now.

00:04:52.640 --> 00:04:54.840
Our flares now been sitting
in the liquid nitrogen

00:04:54.849 --> 00:04:56.500
for four or five minutes.

00:04:56.500 --> 00:05:00.300
So I'm going to say it is good and frozen,
at least where I'm going to be lighting it.

00:05:00.300 --> 00:05:02.700
[Music]

00:05:02.700 --> 00:05:03.960
It looks the same.

00:05:04.820 --> 00:05:06.680
Let's see if it lights the same.

00:05:06.680 --> 00:05:15.020
[Music]

00:05:15.020 --> 00:05:15.740
There it goes.

00:05:15.740 --> 00:05:16.400
There it goes.

00:05:16.400 --> 00:05:19.980
[Music]

00:05:19.980 --> 00:05:22.780
Well, it was definitely
harder to get it to light.

00:05:24.340 --> 00:05:31.220
And so far, I think this has
got a little less burning power

00:05:31.220 --> 00:05:33.460
than it did when it wasn't frozen.

00:05:33.660 --> 00:05:37.400
Of course, as it burns,
it warms itself back up.

00:05:37.800 --> 00:05:40.400
And so it may not be
a very long lasting effect.

00:05:40.400 --> 00:05:42.800
It definitely was harder
to get it started though.

00:05:42.800 --> 00:05:43.640
Still burning.

00:05:44.140 --> 00:05:45.400
Can't deny that.

00:05:45.400 --> 00:05:48.620
[Music]

00:05:48.620 --> 00:05:49.820
Guys, there's still more for you to see.

00:05:49.820 --> 00:05:50.960
That little box up at the top

00:05:50.960 --> 00:05:53.000
will transport you
directly to our last video.

00:05:53.000 --> 00:05:54.000
Go check it out.

00:05:54.000 --> 00:05:55.800
The box at the bottom
will show you what YouTube thinks

00:05:55.800 --> 00:05:56.780
you should be watching next.

00:05:56.780 --> 00:05:59.700
And this bomb here in the center
will subscribe to the channel,

00:05:59.700 --> 00:06:01.300
so you never miss another video.

00:06:01.300 --> 00:06:02.560
Don't forget to ring that bell.

00:06:02.569 --> 00:06:03.569
And we'll see you in the next one.

00:06:03.569 --> 00:06:04.380
Talk to you then.
