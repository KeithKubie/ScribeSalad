00:00:13.440 --> 00:00:16.040
The world needs bridges.

00:00:17.920 --> 00:00:21.040
Have you ever thought about
what it would be like not to have any?

00:00:21.880 --> 00:00:25.016
It's hard to imagine
a civilization without bridges

00:00:25.040 --> 00:00:26.416
because they're so essential

00:00:26.440 --> 00:00:29.176
for growth and development
of human society,

00:00:29.200 --> 00:00:33.120
but they're not just about a safe way
across a river or an obstacle.

00:00:35.720 --> 00:00:38.976
They shout about connectivity --

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:40.200
community.

00:00:40.960 --> 00:00:42.856
They reveal something about creativity,

00:00:42.880 --> 00:00:44.095
our ingenuity --

00:00:44.119 --> 00:00:46.440
they even hint at our identity.

00:00:49.240 --> 00:00:51.496
And when bridges fail,

00:00:51.520 --> 00:00:53.416
or are destroyed in conflict,

00:00:53.440 --> 00:00:55.216
communities struggle,

00:00:55.240 --> 00:00:57.240
development stagnates, people suffer.

00:00:59.280 --> 00:01:01.096
Even today,

00:01:01.120 --> 00:01:05.016
there are over one billion people
living in poor, rural communities

00:01:05.040 --> 00:01:06.256
around the world

00:01:06.280 --> 00:01:08.216
that do not have safe, year-round access

00:01:08.240 --> 00:01:10.696
to the things that you
and I take for granted:

00:01:10.720 --> 00:01:13.280
education, medical care,
access to markets ...

00:01:14.960 --> 00:01:18.136
which is why wonderful organizations
like Bridges to Prosperity

00:01:18.160 --> 00:01:21.216
build bridges in this kind of place --
this is in Rwanda.

00:01:21.240 --> 00:01:23.616
And they make such a difference,

00:01:23.640 --> 00:01:26.776
not only to those lives
immediately around the bridge,

00:01:26.800 --> 00:01:28.766
but the impact of these bridges is huge,

00:01:28.790 --> 00:01:31.256
and it spreads over the whole community,

00:01:31.280 --> 00:01:32.520
far, far away.

00:01:34.040 --> 00:01:37.216
Of course bridges have been around
for an awfully long time.

00:01:37.240 --> 00:01:41.176
The oldest ones are stone
because it's a very durable material.

00:01:41.200 --> 00:01:42.456
I don't know about you --

00:01:42.480 --> 00:01:44.696
I love to look at
the development of technology

00:01:44.720 --> 00:01:47.056
to learn about what people did
with the materials

00:01:47.080 --> 00:01:49.360
and tools available to them at the time.

00:01:50.200 --> 00:01:53.016
So the Pont Du Gard in the center
is a wonderful example --

00:01:53.040 --> 00:01:55.376
Roman aqueduct in the South of France --

00:01:55.400 --> 00:01:58.976
fantastic piece of technology
built using massive stones put together,

00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:01.376
dry -- there's no mortar in those joints.

00:02:01.400 --> 00:02:03.336
They're just dry stone joints --

00:02:03.360 --> 00:02:04.576
fantastic

00:02:04.600 --> 00:02:06.160
and almost as good as new today.

00:02:08.360 --> 00:02:09.976
Or sometimes up in the mountains,

00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:12.856
people would build
these suspension bridges,

00:02:12.880 --> 00:02:14.656
often across some dizzy canyon,

00:02:14.680 --> 00:02:15.896
using a vine.

00:02:15.920 --> 00:02:17.456
In this case, this is in Peru.

00:02:17.480 --> 00:02:19.816
This is using grass which grows locally

00:02:19.840 --> 00:02:22.056
and is woven into ropes
to build these bridges.

00:02:22.080 --> 00:02:25.240
And do you know
they rebuild this every year?

00:02:26.160 --> 00:02:28.600
Because of course grass
is not a durable material.

00:02:29.600 --> 00:02:31.720
So this bridge is unchanged
since Inca times.

00:02:34.720 --> 00:02:37.240
And bridges can be
symbols of their location.

00:02:38.400 --> 00:02:40.856
Of course, Golden Gate
and Sydney are well familiar.

00:02:40.880 --> 00:02:44.416
In Mostar the bridge was synonymous
with the name of the place,

00:02:44.440 --> 00:02:47.936
and to such an extent
that in the war in 1993

00:02:47.960 --> 00:02:49.416
when the bridge was destroyed,

00:02:49.440 --> 00:02:52.760
the town all but lost its identity
until the bridge was reconstructed.

00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:57.576
And bridges are enormous
features in our landscape --

00:02:57.600 --> 00:02:59.976
not just enormous,
sometimes there's small ones --

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:02.696
and they are really significant features,

00:03:02.720 --> 00:03:06.600
and I believe we have a duty
to make our bridges beautiful.

00:03:08.320 --> 00:03:09.656
Thankfully, many people do.

00:03:09.680 --> 00:03:13.576
Think of the stunning Millau Viaduct
in the South of France.

00:03:13.600 --> 00:03:17.136
French engineer Michel Virlogeux
and British architect Lord Foster

00:03:17.160 --> 00:03:19.216
collaborated together to produce something

00:03:19.240 --> 00:03:22.936
which is a really spectacular
synergy of architecture and engineering.

00:03:22.960 --> 00:03:27.456
Or Robert Maillart's Salginatobel Bridge
in the mountains in Switzerland --

00:03:27.480 --> 00:03:28.760
absolutely sublime.

00:03:29.880 --> 00:03:31.096
Or more recently,

00:03:31.120 --> 00:03:34.176
Laurent Ney's beautiful
and rather delicate bridge

00:03:34.200 --> 00:03:36.040
for Tintagel Castle in the UK.

00:03:37.520 --> 00:03:39.736
These are spectacular
and beautiful designs

00:03:39.760 --> 00:03:41.320
and we need to see more of this.

00:03:43.040 --> 00:03:46.840
Bridges can be considered
in three convenient categories,

00:03:48.800 --> 00:03:51.296
depending on the nature
of the structural system

00:03:51.320 --> 00:03:54.216
that they adopt
as their principal support.

00:03:54.240 --> 00:03:57.376
So, bending, of course,
is the way a beam will behave --

00:03:57.400 --> 00:03:59.120
so, beams and bending.

00:03:59.880 --> 00:04:04.000
Or compression is the principal
way of operating for an arch.

00:04:04.720 --> 00:04:07.376
Or for the really long spans
you need to go lightweight,

00:04:07.400 --> 00:04:08.736
as we'll see in a minute,

00:04:08.760 --> 00:04:11.416
and you'll use tension, cables --

00:04:11.440 --> 00:04:12.896
suspension bridges.

00:04:12.920 --> 00:04:15.200
And the opportunity
for variety is enormous.

00:04:16.400 --> 00:04:19.616
Engineers have a fantastic scope
for innovation and ingenuity

00:04:19.640 --> 00:04:22.200
and developing different forms
around these types.

00:04:25.520 --> 00:04:29.216
But technological change
happens relatively slowly in my world,

00:04:29.240 --> 00:04:30.456
believe it or not,

00:04:30.480 --> 00:04:35.016
compared to the changes
that happen in mobile phone technology

00:04:35.040 --> 00:04:37.376
and computers and digital
technologies and so on.

00:04:37.400 --> 00:04:39.656
In our world of construction,

00:04:39.680 --> 00:04:42.240
the changes seem positively glacial.

00:04:44.040 --> 00:04:46.600
And the reason for this
can be summarized in one word:

00:04:48.040 --> 00:04:49.240
risk.

00:04:50.680 --> 00:04:52.696
Structural engineers like me manage risk.

00:04:52.720 --> 00:04:54.696
We are responsible for structural safety.

00:04:54.720 --> 00:04:55.936
That's what we do.

00:04:55.960 --> 00:04:57.816
And when we design bridges like these,

00:04:57.840 --> 00:05:02.736
I have to balance the probability
that loads will be excessive on one side

00:05:02.760 --> 00:05:05.896
or the strength will be
too low on the other side.

00:05:05.920 --> 00:05:09.696
Both of which, incidentally,
are full of uncertainty usually,

00:05:09.710 --> 00:05:11.466
and so it's a probabilistic problem,

00:05:11.490 --> 00:05:12.696
and we have to make sure

00:05:12.720 --> 00:05:16.056
that there's an adequate margin
for safety between the two, of course.

00:05:16.080 --> 00:05:18.136
There's no such thing, I have to tell you,

00:05:18.160 --> 00:05:19.416
as absolute safety.

00:05:19.440 --> 00:05:21.816
Contrary to popular belief,

00:05:21.840 --> 00:05:23.360
zero risk doesn't exist.

00:05:25.720 --> 00:05:28.776
Engineers have to do their calculations
and get their sums right

00:05:28.800 --> 00:05:30.856
to make sure that those margins are there,

00:05:30.880 --> 00:05:32.536
and society expects them to do so,

00:05:32.560 --> 00:05:35.800
which is why it's all the more alarming
when things like this happen.

00:05:39.080 --> 00:05:42.816
I'm not going to go into the reasons
for these tragedies,

00:05:42.840 --> 00:05:45.176
but they are part of the reason

00:05:45.200 --> 00:05:47.576
why technological change
happens quite slowly.

00:05:47.600 --> 00:05:48.960
Nobody wants this to happen.

00:05:50.280 --> 00:05:53.240
Clients don't want this to happen
on their projects, obviously.

00:05:54.120 --> 00:05:56.096
And yet of course they want innovation.

00:05:56.120 --> 00:05:58.056
Innovation is vital.

00:05:58.080 --> 00:06:01.056
As an engineer, it's part of my DNA.

00:06:01.080 --> 00:06:02.896
It's in my blood.

00:06:02.920 --> 00:06:06.656
I couldn't be a very good engineer
if I wasn't wanting to innovate,

00:06:06.680 --> 00:06:09.616
but we have to do so from a position
of knowledge and strength

00:06:09.640 --> 00:06:10.880
and understanding.

00:06:12.080 --> 00:06:13.936
It's no good taking a leap in the dark,

00:06:13.960 --> 00:06:17.416
and civilization has learned from mistakes
since the beginning of time --

00:06:17.440 --> 00:06:18.880
no one more so than engineers.

00:06:22.040 --> 00:06:24.176
Some of you may have seen
this film before --

00:06:24.200 --> 00:06:26.776
this is the very famous
Tacoma Narrows Bridge collapse

00:06:26.800 --> 00:06:28.720
in Tacoma, Washington state,

00:06:30.200 --> 00:06:31.400
1940.

00:06:32.200 --> 00:06:34.336
The bridge became known
as "Galloping Gertie"

00:06:34.360 --> 00:06:35.616
because she -- she?

00:06:35.640 --> 00:06:37.416
Is a bridge female? I don't know.

00:06:37.440 --> 00:06:40.736
She was wobbling like this
for quite a long time,

00:06:40.760 --> 00:06:42.720
and notice this twisting motion.

00:06:43.800 --> 00:06:45.376
The bridge was far too flexible.

00:06:45.400 --> 00:06:47.656
It was designed by a chap
called Leon Moisseiff,

00:06:47.680 --> 00:06:49.616
no stranger to suspension bridge design,

00:06:49.640 --> 00:06:52.776
but in this case he pushed the limits
just that little bit too far

00:06:52.800 --> 00:06:54.040
and paid the price.

00:06:54.520 --> 00:06:56.896
Thankfully, nobody was killed.

00:06:56.920 --> 00:07:00.736
But this bridge collapse stopped
suspension bridge development

00:07:00.760 --> 00:07:01.960
dead in its tracks.

00:07:02.680 --> 00:07:06.256
For 10 years nobody thought
about doing another suspension bridge.

00:07:06.280 --> 00:07:07.536
There were none.

00:07:07.560 --> 00:07:09.416
And when they did emerge in the 1950s,

00:07:09.440 --> 00:07:11.393
they were an understandable overreaction,

00:07:11.417 --> 00:07:14.737
this sort of oversafe response
to what had happened.

00:07:15.880 --> 00:07:18.280
But when it did occur in the mid-60s,

00:07:19.320 --> 00:07:20.936
there was indeed a step change --

00:07:20.960 --> 00:07:23.816
an innovation,
a technological step change.

00:07:23.840 --> 00:07:25.560
This is the Severn Bridge in the UK.

00:07:26.200 --> 00:07:29.616
Notice the aerodynamically
streamlined cross section

00:07:29.640 --> 00:07:30.856
in the center there.

00:07:30.880 --> 00:07:33.616
It's also a box which makes it
very torsionally stiff --

00:07:33.640 --> 00:07:37.496
that twisting motion which we saw
at Tacoma would not happen here.

00:07:37.520 --> 00:07:39.136
And it's also really lightweight,

00:07:39.160 --> 00:07:40.576
and as we'll see in a moment,

00:07:40.600 --> 00:07:43.416
lightweight is really
important for long spans,

00:07:43.440 --> 00:07:47.016
and everybody seems
to want us to build longer spans.

00:07:47.040 --> 00:07:48.896
The longest at the moment is in Japan.

00:07:48.920 --> 00:07:52.816
It's just under 2,000 meters -- one span.

00:07:52.840 --> 00:07:54.096
Just under two kilometers.

00:07:54.120 --> 00:07:55.456
The Akashi Kaikyō Bridge.

00:07:55.480 --> 00:07:58.446
We're currently working on one in Turkey
which is a bit longer,

00:07:58.460 --> 00:08:00.656
and we've designed
the Messina Bridge in Italy,

00:08:00.680 --> 00:08:03.656
which is just waiting to get started
with construction one day,

00:08:03.680 --> 00:08:04.896
who knows when.

00:08:04.920 --> 00:08:06.096
(Laughter)

00:08:06.120 --> 00:08:08.776
I'm going to come back
to Messina in a moment.

00:08:08.800 --> 00:08:13.896
But the other kind of long-span bridge
which uses that tension principle

00:08:13.920 --> 00:08:15.256
is the cable-stayed bridge,

00:08:15.280 --> 00:08:16.856
and we see a lot of these.

00:08:16.880 --> 00:08:20.536
In fact, in China they're building
a whole load of these right now.

00:08:20.560 --> 00:08:24.456
The longest of these is the Russky Bridge
in Vladivostok, Russia --

00:08:24.480 --> 00:08:26.256
just over 1,100 meters.

00:08:26.280 --> 00:08:29.776
But let me take you back to this question
about long-span and lightweight.

00:08:29.800 --> 00:08:31.856
This is using Messina Bridge
as an example.

00:08:31.880 --> 00:08:36.336
The pie chart in the center represents
the capacity of the main cables --

00:08:36.360 --> 00:08:38.016
that's what holds the bridge up --

00:08:38.040 --> 00:08:39.600
the capacity of the main cables.

00:08:40.400 --> 00:08:43.296
And notice that 78 percent
of that capacity

00:08:43.320 --> 00:08:45.960
is used up just holding the bridge up.

00:08:47.880 --> 00:08:49.895
There's only 22 percent of its capacity --

00:08:49.919 --> 00:08:51.336
that's less than a quarter --

00:08:51.360 --> 00:08:52.616
available for the payload,

00:08:52.640 --> 00:08:54.816
the stuff that the bridge
is there to support:

00:08:54.840 --> 00:08:56.560
the railway, the road and so on.

00:08:58.200 --> 00:08:59.456
And in fact,

00:08:59.480 --> 00:09:02.096
over 50 percent of that payload --

00:09:02.120 --> 00:09:03.536
of that dead load --

00:09:03.560 --> 00:09:04.936
is the cable on its own.

00:09:04.960 --> 00:09:06.976
Just the cable without any bridge deck.

00:09:07.000 --> 00:09:09.536
If we could make that cable lighter,

00:09:09.560 --> 00:09:11.056
we could span longer.

00:09:11.080 --> 00:09:14.536
Right now if we use the high-strength
steel wire available to us,

00:09:14.560 --> 00:09:18.016
we can span, practically speaking,
around about five or six kilometers

00:09:18.040 --> 00:09:19.280
if we really push it.

00:09:20.480 --> 00:09:23.536
But if we could use
carbon fiber in those cables,

00:09:23.560 --> 00:09:25.440
we could go more than 10 kilometers.

00:09:26.560 --> 00:09:27.800
That's pretty spectacular.

00:09:30.200 --> 00:09:34.896
But of course superspans is not
necessarily the way to go everywhere.

00:09:34.920 --> 00:09:36.136
They're very expensive

00:09:36.160 --> 00:09:39.303
and they've got all sorts
of other challenges associated with them,

00:09:39.327 --> 00:09:40.776
and we tend to build multispan

00:09:40.800 --> 00:09:43.280
when we're crossing
a wide estuary or a sea crossing.

00:09:44.080 --> 00:09:47.496
But of course if that sea crossing
were somewhere like Gibraltar,

00:09:47.520 --> 00:09:49.976
or in this case, the Red Sea,

00:09:50.000 --> 00:09:54.456
we would indeed be building
multiple superlong spans

00:09:54.480 --> 00:09:57.376
and that would be
something spectacular, wouldn't it?

00:09:57.400 --> 00:10:00.456
I don't think I'm going to see
that one finished in my lifetime,

00:10:00.480 --> 00:10:03.520
but it will certainly be worth waiting for
for some of you guys.

00:10:04.800 --> 00:10:08.296
Well, I want to tell you about something
which I think is really exciting.

00:10:08.320 --> 00:10:12.816
This is a multispan suspension bridge
across very deep water in Norway,

00:10:12.840 --> 00:10:14.760
and we're working on this at the moment.

00:10:15.400 --> 00:10:19.216
The deep water means that foundations
are prohibitively expensive.

00:10:19.240 --> 00:10:21.480
So this bridge floats.

00:10:23.240 --> 00:10:25.496
This is a floating,
multispan suspension bridge.

00:10:25.520 --> 00:10:28.200
We've had floating bridges before,
but nothing like this.

00:10:29.040 --> 00:10:30.616
It stands on floating pontoons

00:10:30.640 --> 00:10:32.976
which are tethered to the seabed
and held down --

00:10:33.000 --> 00:10:36.096
so, pulled down
against those buoyancy forces,

00:10:36.120 --> 00:10:37.696
and in order to make it stable,

00:10:37.720 --> 00:10:40.416
the tops of the towers
have to be tied together,

00:10:40.440 --> 00:10:43.216
otherwise the whole thing
would just wobble around

00:10:43.240 --> 00:10:44.936
and nobody will want to go on that.

00:10:44.960 --> 00:10:46.576
But I'm really excited about this

00:10:46.600 --> 00:10:49.176
because if you think
about the places around the world

00:10:49.200 --> 00:10:50.456
where the water is so deep

00:10:50.480 --> 00:10:53.736
that nobody has given a second thought
to the possibility of a bridge

00:10:53.760 --> 00:10:55.056
or any kind of crossing,

00:10:55.080 --> 00:10:56.920
this now opens up that possibility.

00:10:58.600 --> 00:11:01.640
So this one's being done
by the Norwegian Roads Administration,

00:11:02.600 --> 00:11:04.056
but I'm really excited to know

00:11:04.080 --> 00:11:06.576
where else will this technology
enable development --

00:11:06.600 --> 00:11:08.616
that growing together,

00:11:08.640 --> 00:11:09.960
that building of community.

00:11:13.720 --> 00:11:14.960
Now, what about concrete?

00:11:16.160 --> 00:11:18.480
Concrete gets a pretty bad name sometimes,

00:11:20.080 --> 00:11:23.696
but in the hands of people
like Rudy Ricciotti here,

00:11:23.720 --> 00:11:25.120
look what you can do with it.

00:11:26.400 --> 00:11:29.856
This is what we call ultra-high
performance fiber-reinforced concrete.

00:11:29.880 --> 00:11:31.120
It's a bit of a mouthful.

00:11:31.680 --> 00:11:33.576
Us engineers love those kinds of words.

00:11:33.600 --> 00:11:35.856
(Laughter)

00:11:35.880 --> 00:11:37.256
But what you do with this --

00:11:37.280 --> 00:11:39.736
this is really superstrong,
and it's really durable,

00:11:39.750 --> 00:11:42.110
and you can get this fantastic
sculptural quality.

00:11:43.200 --> 00:11:44.880
Who said concrete bridges are dull?

00:11:47.680 --> 00:11:50.816
We could talk about all sorts
of other new technologies and things

00:11:50.840 --> 00:11:52.056
which are going on,

00:11:52.080 --> 00:11:54.296
robots and 3-D printing
and AI and all of that,

00:11:54.320 --> 00:11:57.654
but I want to take you back to something
which I alluded to earlier on.

00:11:59.518 --> 00:12:01.376
Our bridges need to be functional, yes.

00:12:01.400 --> 00:12:03.096
They need to be safe -- absolutely.

00:12:03.120 --> 00:12:05.040
They need to be serviceable and durable.

00:12:05.880 --> 00:12:08.296
But I passionately believe
they need to be elegant;

00:12:08.320 --> 00:12:09.559
they need to be beautiful.

00:12:12.360 --> 00:12:14.320
Our bridges are designed for a long time.

00:12:15.280 --> 00:12:17.096
We tend to design for 100 years plus.

00:12:17.120 --> 00:12:19.520
They're going to be there
for an awfully long time.

00:12:20.480 --> 00:12:22.736
Nobody is going to remember the cost.

00:12:22.760 --> 00:12:25.240
Nobody will remember
whether it overran a few months.

00:12:26.240 --> 00:12:28.080
But if it's ugly or just dull,

00:12:29.400 --> 00:12:31.136
it will always be ugly or dull.

00:12:31.160 --> 00:12:32.960
(Laughter)

00:12:34.040 --> 00:12:35.280
Bridges --

00:12:36.320 --> 00:12:38.536
beauty enriches life.

00:12:38.560 --> 00:12:39.760
Doesn't it?

00:12:40.640 --> 00:12:42.376
It enhances our well-being.

00:12:42.400 --> 00:12:44.760
Ugliness and mediocrity
does exactly the opposite.

00:12:45.640 --> 00:12:49.656
And if we go on building
mediocre, ugly environments --

00:12:49.680 --> 00:12:52.040
and I believe we're becoming
numb to that stuff --

00:12:53.880 --> 00:12:55.136
if we go on doing that,

00:12:55.160 --> 00:12:58.416
it's something like
a large-scale vandalism,

00:12:58.440 --> 00:13:00.040
which is completely unacceptable.

00:13:01.440 --> 00:13:06.376
(Applause)

00:13:06.400 --> 00:13:08.336
This is a bridge in Lyon in France,

00:13:08.360 --> 00:13:11.536
which was procured
through a design competition.

00:13:11.560 --> 00:13:15.416
And I think we need to start talking
to those people who procure our bridges

00:13:15.440 --> 00:13:16.696
and our structures,

00:13:16.720 --> 00:13:19.576
because it's the procurement
which is often the key.

00:13:19.600 --> 00:13:21.936
Design competitions
is one way to get good design,

00:13:21.960 --> 00:13:23.226
but it's not the only one.

00:13:23.240 --> 00:13:25.296
There's an awful lot
of procurement going on

00:13:25.320 --> 00:13:27.680
that is absolutely prejudiced
against good design.

00:13:29.280 --> 00:13:32.640
So yes, technology happens
a bit slowly sometimes in my world.

00:13:34.480 --> 00:13:36.920
But I'm really excited
about what we can do with it.

00:13:38.160 --> 00:13:40.216
Whether it's saving lives in rural Africa

00:13:40.240 --> 00:13:42.696
or stretching the boundaries
of long-span technology

00:13:42.720 --> 00:13:45.000
or just crossing the road next-door,

00:13:47.040 --> 00:13:50.816
I hope we continue to build
elegant and beautiful stuff

00:13:50.840 --> 00:13:53.080
that save lives and build communities.

00:13:55.080 --> 00:13:56.296
Thank you.

00:13:56.320 --> 00:14:00.000
(Applause)
