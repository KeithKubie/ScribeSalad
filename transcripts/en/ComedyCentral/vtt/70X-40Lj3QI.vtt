- Hello, I'm Jeremy Konner.

00:00:04.770 --> 00:00:07.539
And today we're going
to talk about--

00:00:07.640 --> 00:00:08.541
- [laughs]

00:00:08.641 --> 00:00:09.775
Sorry.

00:00:09.876 --> 00:00:12.211
[laughter]

00:00:12.311 --> 00:00:13.446
That's hello.

00:00:13.546 --> 00:00:14.514 align:start position:0%
<i>You want to say hello.</i>

00:00:14.614 --> 00:00:16.549
- I'm so [bleep] up, man.

00:00:16.649 --> 00:00:17.549
- No, I see.

00:00:17.650 --> 00:00:18.551
You're looking at me over here,

00:00:18.651 --> 00:00:19.719
and I'm over here.

00:00:19.819 --> 00:00:21.387
- You're the goddamn
director of this.

00:00:21.488 --> 00:00:22.521 align:start position:0%
<i>- I know.</i>

00:00:22.621 --> 00:00:24.256 align:start position:0%
<i>I'm the goddamn director
of this.</i>

00:00:24.356 --> 00:00:26.025 align:start position:0%
<i>So far,
my favorite quote.</i>

00:00:26.125 --> 00:00:27.660
Go on.

00:00:27.760 --> 00:00:30.797
- Hello, I'm Jeremy Konner.

00:00:30.897 --> 00:00:33.967
And today we're going
to be talking

00:00:34.067 --> 00:00:37.203
about the L.A. aqueduct.

00:00:37.303 --> 00:00:38.905
- Cheers.
- Cheers.

00:00:39.005 --> 00:00:40.539 align:start position:0%
<i>- Aqueduct.</i>

00:00:40.639 --> 00:00:44.209 line:0%
<i> - So William Mulholland
 is the head</i>

00:00:44.310 --> 00:00:47.013 line:0%
<i>of the L.A. city water company.</i>

00:00:47.113 --> 00:00:48.581 line:0%
<i> And he realizes, like,</i>

00:00:48.681 --> 00:00:49.982 line:0%
<i> We need to figure something
 out,</i>

00:00:50.082 --> 00:00:51.750 line:0%
<i> because L.A. is growing.</i>

00:00:51.850 --> 00:00:54.387 line:0%
<i> And either L.A.
 has to stop growing</i>

00:00:54.487 --> 00:00:57.923 line:0%
<i> or we have to figure out
 more...water.</i>

00:00:58.024 --> 00:01:00.893 line:0%
<i> Mulholland goes to Fred Eaton.</i>

00:01:00.994 --> 00:01:03.262 line:0%
<i> I mean, he's just
 the most powerful man.</i>

00:01:03.362 --> 00:01:05.831 line:0%
<i> And he's like,
 Hey, you're my best friend.</i>

00:01:05.931 --> 00:01:07.366 align:start size:56% position:44%
<i> You're my mentor.</i>

00:01:07.466 --> 00:01:08.435 align:start size:56% position:44%
<i> We're [bleep]-ed.</i>

00:01:08.535 --> 00:01:09.969
<i> Eaton is like,</i>

00:01:10.069 --> 00:01:11.571 align:start position:0%
<i>There is a place</i>

00:01:11.671 --> 00:01:14.373 align:start position:0%
<i>that I used to
go when I was a kid.</i>

00:01:14.473 --> 00:01:18.477 align:start position:0%
<i>It's a [bleep]-ing, like,
200 miles away.</i>

00:01:18.577 --> 00:01:19.579 align:start position:0%
<i>I know.</i>

00:01:19.679 --> 00:01:20.980 align:start position:0%
<i>It sounds nuts.</i>

00:01:21.080 --> 00:01:22.448 size:75% position:38%
<i>But shut the [bleep] up.</i>

00:01:22.548 --> 00:01:24.483 align:start position:0%
<i>It's gonna save
all of our problems.</i>

00:01:24.583 --> 00:01:27.153
Mulholland's like...

00:01:27.253 --> 00:01:30.323 align:end position:100%
<i> I'm interested,
 but I'm not...</i>

00:01:30.423 --> 00:01:35.995 align:end position:100%
<i> like, 100% on your page,
 but I--</i>

00:01:36.095 --> 00:01:37.664 align:start size:56% position:44%
<i> I'm on your page.</i>

00:01:37.764 --> 00:01:38.864 align:start position:0%
<i>- But he's on a page.</i>

00:01:38.964 --> 00:01:40.966
- But he's on the page.

00:01:41.066 --> 00:01:43.602
<i> So they go up
 to the Owens Valley,</i>

00:01:43.702 --> 00:01:45.305
<i> and Eaton is like,</i>

00:01:45.405 --> 00:01:51.043 align:start position:0%
<i>This lake is 4,000 feet
above sea level.</i>

00:01:51.143 --> 00:01:52.412 align:start position:0%
<i>Los Angeles,</i>

00:01:52.512 --> 00:01:54.980 align:start position:0%
<i>just a couple feet
above sea level.</i>

00:01:55.080 --> 00:01:56.215
<i> Mulholland's like,</i>

00:01:56.315 --> 00:01:59.319 align:end position:100%
<i> Oh, my God,
 it's all downhill.</i>

00:01:59.419 --> 00:02:03.021 align:end position:100%
<i> Broop, all the way
 to L.A., 250 miles.</i>

00:02:03.122 --> 00:02:05.858 align:end position:100%
<i> Broop,
 all the way to L.A.</i>

00:02:05.958 --> 00:02:07.159 align:end position:100%
<i> You just [bleep]-ing
 build a pipe,</i>

00:02:07.259 --> 00:02:10.029
broop,
and you get to L.A.

00:02:10.129 --> 00:02:11.297 align:start size:50% position:50%
<i> But Eaton says,</i>

00:02:11.397 --> 00:02:13.766 align:start position:0%
<i>We're gonna have
to break some laws.</i>

00:02:13.866 --> 00:02:19.005 align:start position:0%
<i>We're gonna have to do
some shady, shady...</i>

00:02:19.105 --> 00:02:20.940 align:start position:0%
<i>Can we watch
"My Cousin Vinny"?</i>

00:02:21.040 --> 00:02:22.207
- No, you were talking.

00:02:22.308 --> 00:02:23.776 align:end position:100%
- You don't want to watch
"My Cousin Vinny"?

00:02:23.876 --> 00:02:25.444
- Let's just continue
on the story.

00:02:25.544 --> 00:02:27.113
- Oh, I was saying that--

00:02:27.213 --> 00:02:30.582
[stuttering]

00:02:30.683 --> 00:02:32.685
[laughter]

00:02:32.785 --> 00:02:34.954
<i> So Eaton starts buying up</i>

00:02:35.054 --> 00:02:37.490
<i> all of the Owens Valley,
 illegally,</i>

00:02:37.590 --> 00:02:39.058
<i> because they need
 the water rights.</i>

00:02:39.158 --> 00:02:42.261
<i> And they get the L.A. Times
 to publish fake stories,</i>

00:02:42.361 --> 00:02:43.963
<i> like, "We're all gonna die.</i>

00:02:44.063 --> 00:02:47.066
<i> Guys, if we don't have water,
 we're all gonna die."</i>

00:02:47.166 --> 00:02:48.535
And it's all nonsense.

00:02:48.635 --> 00:02:49.869 align:start size:47% position:53%
<i> It's all fake.</i>

00:02:49.969 --> 00:02:51.537
<i> There's spies,
 there's bribery,</i>

00:02:51.637 --> 00:02:53.472
<i> there's manipulation.</i>

00:02:53.572 --> 00:02:55.474
<i> I mean, these guys
 were the worst--</i>

00:02:55.574 --> 00:02:56.743
<i> worse than anyone.</i>

00:02:56.843 --> 00:02:58.844
But the most [bleep]-ed up
thing is,

00:02:58.944 --> 00:03:01.046
<i> Eaton, he sneaks off
 to his buddies.</i>

00:03:01.146 --> 00:03:02.882 line:0%
<i> This is
 the San Fernando Syndicate.</i>

00:03:02.982 --> 00:03:03.883 line:0%
<i> And he's like,</i>

00:03:03.983 --> 00:03:05.351 align:start position:0% line:0%
<i>There's this big ah--</i>

00:03:05.451 --> 00:03:08.420 align:start position:0% line:0%
<i>big-ass basin in
the San Fernando Valley</i>

00:03:08.520 --> 00:03:12.125 align:start position:0% line:0%
<i>that just [bleep]-ing
is just chilling out here.</i>

00:03:12.225 --> 00:03:14.760 align:start position:0%
<i>Buy up land
in the San Fernando Valley.</i>

00:03:14.860 --> 00:03:16.495 align:start position:0%
<i>And then,
when the water comes,</i>

00:03:16.595 --> 00:03:20.300 align:start position:0%
<i>we're all gonna make
gazillions.</i>

00:03:20.400 --> 00:03:22.535
"Chinatown," man.

00:03:22.635 --> 00:03:23.903 align:start size:47% position:53%
And eventually,

00:03:24.003 --> 00:03:26.672
<i> the people of L.A. vote
 to create the aqueduct.</i>

00:03:26.772 --> 00:03:29.208 line:0%
<i> This is a [bleep]-ing pipe</i>

00:03:29.308 --> 00:03:33.613 line:0%
<i> in 1904, five, six, seven,
 whatever,</i>

00:03:33.713 --> 00:03:38.050 line:0%
<i> 250 miles long.</i>

00:03:38.150 --> 00:03:40.219 line:0%
<i> On the opening,
 William Mulholland</i>

00:03:40.319 --> 00:03:43.255 line:0%
<i> turns on the water,
 and he's like,</i>

00:03:43.355 --> 00:03:44.490 line:0%
<i> There it is.</i>

00:03:44.590 --> 00:03:45.858 line:0%
<i> Take it.</i>

00:03:45.958 --> 00:03:48.227
<i> And the water starts
 [bleep]-ing shooting out.</i>

00:03:48.327 --> 00:03:54.433
<i> And that is the great moment
 of William Mulholland's...</i>

00:03:54.533 --> 00:03:55.968
<i> something.</i>

00:03:56.068 --> 00:03:57.236
Hey.

00:03:57.336 --> 00:03:58.937
- Oh, Jesus.

00:03:59.037 --> 00:04:00.572
- This is so stupid.

00:04:00.673 --> 00:04:01.708
[laughter]

00:04:35.107 --> 00:04:36.108
- [groaning]

00:04:36.208 --> 00:04:37.109
Hello.

00:04:37.210 --> 00:04:38.711
- Hi, Jer.

00:04:38.811 --> 00:04:39.779
What year are we in?

00:04:39.879 --> 00:04:44.383
- I don't know.
- Yes, you do.

00:04:44.483 --> 00:04:46.585 line:0%
<i> After 1913,</i>

00:04:46.685 --> 00:04:49.755 line:0%
<i> water is coming to L.A.
 like nobody's business.</i>

00:04:49.855 --> 00:04:52.492
<i> The population
 is [bleep] exploding.</i>

00:04:52.592 --> 00:04:53.926
<i> There's palm trees.</i>

00:04:54.026 --> 00:04:55.928
<i> Palm trees don't exist
 in Los Angeles.</i>

00:04:56.028 --> 00:04:57.062
It's a desert.

00:04:57.162 --> 00:04:59.498
But the people who profit
most out of this

00:04:59.598 --> 00:05:02.167
<i> is Eaton and his buddies.</i>

00:05:02.267 --> 00:05:03.769 line:0%
Then, in the 1920s,

00:05:03.869 --> 00:05:06.572 line:0%
there's a drought,
and it's a real drought.

00:05:06.672 --> 00:05:09.041 align:end position:100% line:0%
<i> It's a [bleep]-ing
 for real,</i>

00:05:09.141 --> 00:05:11.144 align:end position:100% line:0%
<i> for real, for real,
 for real.</i>

00:05:11.244 --> 00:05:12.511
<i> And Mulholland says,</i>

00:05:12.612 --> 00:05:15.547 align:start position:0%
<i>Oh, my God,
like, this is--</i>

00:05:15.647 --> 00:05:17.016 align:start position:0%
<i>We need a reservoir.</i>

00:05:17.116 --> 00:05:18.951
<i> Mulholland goes to Eaton.</i>

00:05:19.051 --> 00:05:21.553
<i> Eaton has bought up
 the only dam site</i>

00:05:21.653 --> 00:05:22.789
<i> in the entire Owens Valley.</i>

00:05:22.889 --> 00:05:23.923
<i> And he's like,</i>

00:05:24.023 --> 00:05:26.125 align:start position:0%
<i>You can have my dam site
for $1 million.</i>

00:05:26.225 --> 00:05:27.393
<i> And Mulholland's like...</i>

00:05:27.493 --> 00:05:29.728
[distant moaning sound]

00:05:29.829 --> 00:05:32.231
[laughter]

00:05:32.331 --> 00:05:33.599
I didn't do that.

00:05:33.699 --> 00:05:35.134
<i> So Mulholland's like,
 [bleep] it.</i>

00:05:35.234 --> 00:05:37.135 align:end position:100%
<i> I'm gonna build
 the goddamn reservoir,</i>

00:05:37.236 --> 00:05:38.804
<i> and it's gonna be
 [bleep]-ing beautiful,</i>

00:05:38.904 --> 00:05:41.073
<i> and, m'wah, [bleep] you.</i>

00:05:41.173 --> 00:05:44.109 line:0%
<i> And he [bleep]-ing built
 the St. Francis Dam</i>

00:05:44.209 --> 00:05:47.046 line:0%
<i> in San Francis--
 Francisquito.</i>

00:05:47.146 --> 00:05:48.781 line:0%
<i> And everything is great.</i>

00:05:48.881 --> 00:05:50.049 line:0%
<i> And then they go,</i>

00:05:50.149 --> 00:05:52.784 align:start position:0% line:0%
<i>Hey, William Mulholland,
there's a leak.</i>

00:05:52.885 --> 00:05:54.253
<i> And William Mulholland's like,</i>

00:05:54.353 --> 00:05:57.123 align:end position:100%
<i> I'm kind of in the middle

00:05:57.223 --> 00:06:01.894 align:end position:100%
<i> I ain't worried about
 that [bleep] [bleep], dawg.</i>

00:06:01.994 --> 00:06:02.895
<i> He goes to sleep.</i>

00:06:02.995 --> 00:06:04.096
<i> That night,</i>

00:06:04.196 --> 00:06:06.431
<i> he gets a phone call
 in the night.</i>

00:06:06.531 --> 00:06:08.835
<i> The dam has broke.</i>

00:06:08.935 --> 00:06:12.872
<i> There are more dead than
 the San Francisco earthquake.</i>

00:06:12.972 --> 00:06:18.044
<i> And this was
 William Mulholland's downfall.</i>

00:06:18.144 --> 00:06:19.511
But in the end,

00:06:19.611 --> 00:06:23.115
between Mulholland and Eaton,
they were--

00:06:23.215 --> 00:06:25.150
<i> they created Los Angeles,</i>

00:06:25.250 --> 00:06:27.053
<i> but really Mulholland,</i>

00:06:27.153 --> 00:06:28.253
if it weren't for him,

00:06:28.353 --> 00:06:29.755
there would be no Los Angeles.

00:06:29.855 --> 00:06:31.257
- Cheers.

00:06:31.357 --> 00:06:36.061 align:start size:72% position:28%
- L.A. is a [bleep]-ing
nonsense of nonsenses.

00:06:36.161 --> 00:06:38.531 align:start size:59% position:41%
And it's the water.

00:06:41.033 --> 00:06:42.499
I am so [bleep]-ed up.
