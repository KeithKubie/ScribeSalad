FOR MORE WE'RE JOINED BY SENIOR
BLACK CORRESPONDENT AND HOST OF

00:00:04.338 --> 00:00:09.042
THE UPCOMING "NIGHTLY SHOW WITH
LARRY WILLMORE."

00:00:09.076 --> 00:00:10.777
MR. LARRY WILLMORE. NICE TO SEE
YOU.

00:00:10.811 --> 00:00:12.713
[CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]
THANK YOU FOR BEING

00:00:12.746 --> 00:00:13.113
HERE. I'M EXCITED
ABOUT "THE NIGHTLY SHOW."

00:00:13.146 --> 00:00:15.916
&gt;&gt; THANK YOU.

00:00:15.949 --> 00:00:16.850
&gt;&gt; Jon: I'M EXCITED. I'M EXCITED
ABOUT THAT.

00:00:16.884 --> 00:00:18.952
&gt;&gt; "THE NIGHTLY SHOW," WHEN DOES
THAT START?

00:00:18.986 --> 00:00:20.087
&gt;&gt; Jon: I BELIEVE ACTUALLY
JANUARY 19TH.

00:00:20.120 --> 00:00:20.787
&gt;&gt; OH YES.

00:00:20.821 --> 00:00:21.488
MARTIN LUTHER KING DAY.

00:00:21.522 --> 00:00:23.457
I HAVE A JOB.

00:00:23.490 --> 00:00:24.791
&gt;&gt; Jon: LARRY, IF I MAY.

00:00:24.825 --> 00:00:28.862
THERE'S BEEN SOME TALK THAT NONE
OF THESE EVENTS OF THE PAST FEW

00:00:28.896 --> 00:00:30.397
WEEKS HAVE ACTUALLY BEEN ABOUT
RACE.

00:00:30.430 --> 00:00:36.003
&gt;&gt; THE REAL EPIDEMIC IS YOUNG
BLACK MEN KILLING OTHER YOUNG

00:00:36.036 --> 00:00:37.171
BLACK MEN.

00:00:37.204 --> 00:00:41.508
&gt;&gt; 93% OF BLACKS ARE SHOT BY
OTHER BLACKS. THEY'RE KILLING

00:00:41.542 --> 00:00:44.678
EACH OTHER THEY DON'T TALK
ABOUT THAT. WHEN DO YOU HEAR

00:00:44.711 --> 00:00:47.447
THEM TALK ABOUT, HOW DO WE
REDUCE THE CRIME.

00:00:47.481 --> 00:00:49.116
&gt;&gt; Jon: WELL, YOU KNOW, LARRY,
WHAT DO YOU SAY TO THOSE PEOPLE?

00:00:49.149 --> 00:00:50.250
&gt;&gt;OH I DON'T KNOW, JON. I WOULD
SAY THEY SHOULD PROBABLY

00:00:50.284 --> 00:00:54.321
GO [BEEP] THEMSELVES. MAYBE?

00:00:54.354 --> 00:00:54.755
&gt;&gt; Jon: I SEE WHAT YOU'RE
SAYING.

00:00:54.788 --> 00:00:55.589
&gt;&gt; WELL NO, JON.

00:00:55.622 --> 00:00:58.091
[CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]
&gt;&gt; Jon: ALRIGHT.

00:00:58.125 --> 00:01:02.863
&gt;&gt; FIRST OF ALL, CAN WE QUIT
CALLING IT BLACK ON BLACK CRIME.

00:01:02.896 --> 00:01:04.932
IT'S JUST CRIME, OKAY.

00:01:04.965 --> 00:01:11.772
I MEAN, BLACK ON BLACK
JUST MAKES IT SOUND LIKE

00:01:11.805 --> 00:01:17.211
A CATEGORY ON RED TUBE. THAT'S
A PORN SITE, JON.

00:01:17.244 --> 00:01:17.945
&gt;&gt; Jon: OH, THAT'S A -- OH
YES, THAT'S RIGHT. THAT'S A --

00:01:17.978 --> 00:01:20.380
&gt;&gt; YOU HAVE IT BOOKMARKED.

00:01:20.414 --> 00:01:22.382
Jon: DO I HAVE IT BOOKMARKED?

00:01:22.416 --> 00:01:26.286
I ONLY BOOKMARK IT SO I CAN PICK
UP WHERE I LEFT OFF IN THE

00:01:26.320 --> 00:01:26.920
STORY.

00:01:26.954 --> 00:01:31.158
&gt;&gt; WHERE DID YOU LEAVE OFF?

00:01:31.191 --> 00:01:33.660
Jon: THEY WERE [BEEP].

00:01:33.694 --> 00:01:38.265
[LAUGHING]
SO, SPOILER ALERT.

00:01:38.298 --> 00:01:42.870
I'M NOT GOING TO TELL YOU HOW IT
ENDS BUT GET A TOWEL.

00:01:42.903 --> 00:01:46.406
YOU DON'T THINK A CONVERSATION
ABOUT BLACK ON BLACK CRIME

00:01:46.440 --> 00:01:47.207
SHOULD BE HAPPENING NOW?

00:01:47.241 --> 00:01:48.909
&gt;&gt; IT IS, JON.

00:01:48.942 --> 00:01:51.445
BUT IT'S A BLACK ON BLACK
CONVERSATION.

00:01:51.478 --> 00:01:54.248
I MEAN, JUST BECAUSE YOU'RE NOT
HEARING IT DOESN'T MEAN IT'S NOT

00:01:54.281 --> 00:01:55.048
HAPPENING.

00:01:55.082 --> 00:01:57.885
GO TO ANY BLACK CHURCH ON A
SUNDAY.

00:01:57.918 --> 00:02:01.889
&gt;&gt; Jon: WELL THAT'S -- SEE, I
WOULD LOVE TO HEAR THAT

00:02:01.922 --> 00:02:02.990
CONVERSATION. COULD I LISTEN TO
IT SOME TIME?

00:02:03.023 --> 00:02:08.095
&gt;&gt; SURE WHICH BLACK CHURCH DO
YOU ATTEND, BROTHER?

00:02:08.128 --> 00:02:11.765
&gt;&gt; Jon: I TWO GO TO THE FIRST
TEMPLE BAPTIST BLACK CHURCH.

00:02:11.798 --> 00:02:13.233
&gt;&gt; THAT'S OKAY, JON.

00:02:13.267 --> 00:02:14.701
I DON'T GO EITHER.

00:02:14.735 --> 00:02:15.802
&gt;&gt; Jon: OH, ALRIGHT. THANK YOU.

00:02:15.836 --> 00:02:19.239
&gt;&gt; BUT IT'S NOT LIKE BLACK
CRIMINALS ARE THE ONLY THING

00:02:19.273 --> 00:02:21.808
KILLING BLACK PEOPLE.

00:02:21.842 --> 00:02:25.245
DIABETES, STROKE AND HEART
DISEASE ARE KICKING

00:02:25.279 --> 00:02:26.446
BLACK ON BLACK CRIME'S ASS.
OKAY?

00:02:26.480 --> 00:02:31.485
BUT NOBODY IS SAYING WE NEED TO
GET GET RID OF THOSE BEFORE

00:02:31.518 --> 00:02:32.753
WE CAN TALK ABOUT RACISM.

00:02:32.786 --> 00:02:36.590
&gt;&gt; Jon: WELL SO, DO YOU THINK
PEOPLE ARE USING THIS ARGUMENT

00:02:36.623 --> 00:02:36.957
AS A WAY TO INVALIDATE THE
RIGHTEOUS NATURE OF ANY OF THE

00:02:36.990 --> 00:02:38.192
PROTESTS.

00:02:38.225 --> 00:02:38.792
&gt;&gt; WELL, JON. PEOPLE ARE USING A
LOT OF ARGUMENTS TO INVALIDATE

00:02:38.825 --> 00:02:39.960
THE PROTESTS.

00:02:39.993 --> 00:02:45.165
&gt;&gt; THE PROTESTERS WHO DID NOT
LOOT OR BURN OR ASSAULT THE

00:02:45.199 --> 00:02:46.333
POLICE BUT WHO REMAINED IN
THE FRAY ARE GUILTY OF AIDING

00:02:46.366 --> 00:02:47.801
AND ABETTING THOSE WHO DID BY
PROVIDING THEM COVER AND

00:02:47.835 --> 00:02:49.703
SUPPORT. IT SET BACK
RACE RELATIONS IN AMERICA YEARS.

00:02:49.736 --> 00:02:54.775
THE VIOLENT PROTESTS
ACTUALLY CREATED MORE

00:02:54.808 --> 00:02:57.110
BIAS AGAINST BLACKS.

00:02:57.144 --> 00:02:58.445
[BOOING]
&gt;&gt; [BEEP]

00:02:58.478 --> 00:03:03.717
MORE BIAS AGAINST BLACK
PEOPLE.

00:03:03.750 --> 00:03:07.754
OH, NO BLACK PEOPLE, WE WERE SO
CLOSE.

00:03:07.788 --> 00:03:08.822
WHAT DID YOU DO? STUPID BLACK
PEOPLE.

00:03:08.856 --> 00:03:11.158
YOU KNOW, I HAVE A DREAM, JON.

00:03:11.191 --> 00:03:17.564
THAT ONE DAY THE ACTIONS OF A
FEW [BLEEP] WHITE PEOPLE WILL BE

00:03:17.598 --> 00:03:19.499
SEEN AS
DISCREDITING THEIR ENTIRE RACE.

00:03:19.533 --> 00:03:21.602
&gt;&gt; Jon: WELL, EVERYONE KEEPS
MAKING EXCUSES.

00:03:21.635 --> 00:03:24.204
BE IT CRIME OR OTHER ISSUES.

00:03:24.238 --> 00:03:26.607
FOR WHY WE CAN'T TALK ABOUT
RACISM.

00:03:26.640 --> 00:03:28.242
OR WHY IT'S NOT RACISM.

00:03:28.275 --> 00:03:29.810
HOW DO WE END RACISM?

00:03:29.843 --> 00:03:31.578
&gt;&gt; JON, WE WON'T END IT.

00:03:31.612 --> 00:03:34.481
THE WORLD HAS ALWAYS BEEN LIKE
THIS.

00:03:34.515 --> 00:03:36.083
BROTHER AGAINST
BROTHER. TRIBE AGAINST TRIBE.

00:03:36.116 --> 00:03:37.484
IT'S NOT JUST GOING TO GO AWAY.
IT'S PART OF OUR DNA.

00:03:37.518 --> 00:03:40.220
WE'RE RACEAHOLICS, JON.

00:03:40.254 --> 00:03:42.055
WE WILL ALWAYS BE IN RECOVERY .

00:03:42.089 --> 00:03:46.293
THE BEST WE CAN HOPE FOR IS TO
MANAGE IT.

00:03:46.326 --> 00:03:47.861
&gt;&gt; Jon: SO, I GUESS WE'RE NEVER
ACTUALLY GOING TO GET THAT

00:03:47.895 --> 00:03:49.096
30-DAY CHIP ARE WE?

00:03:49.129 --> 00:03:51.999
&gt;&gt; 30 DAY CHIP? WE CAN'T EVEN
ACKNOWLEDGE THAT WE HAVE A

00:03:52.032 --> 00:03:54.234
PROBLEM. I MEAN, WE'RE NOT EVEN
AT THE MEETING YET.

00:03:54.268 --> 00:03:59.439
WE'RE STILL LYING IN A POOL OF
OUR OWN VOMIT GOING, I'M FINE,

00:03:59.473 --> 00:04:00.641
I'M FINE. JUST GOTTA -- I'LL BE
OKAY.

00:04:00.674 --> 00:04:03.410
&gt;&gt; Jon: THANK YOU VERY MUCH,
LARRY. LARRY WILMORE, EVERYBODY.

00:04:03.443 --> 00:04:04.444
WE WILL BE RIGHT BACK.
