00:00:01.367 --> 00:00:03.269
Welcome back!

00:00:03.302 --> 00:00:05.805
Now, these days,
social media has the power

00:00:05.838 --> 00:00:08.608
to make and break careers
in the blink of a retweet.

00:00:08.641 --> 00:00:11.277
So here to catch us up on who's
making waves online this week

00:00:11.310 --> 00:00:13.212
is<i> Nightly Show</i> contributor
Franchesca Ramsey

00:00:13.245 --> 00:00:15.281
with another installment
of Hash It Out.

00:00:15.314 --> 00:00:17.250
-♪ ♪
-(bird tweets)

00:00:19.385 --> 00:00:21.287
Thanks, Larry.

00:00:21.320 --> 00:00:24.757
Last week, I got my life from
Jesse Williams' powerful speech

00:00:24.790 --> 00:00:26.092
at the BET Awards.

00:00:26.125 --> 00:00:28.428
(cheering and applause)

00:00:28.461 --> 00:00:31.831
In it, he encouraged black
people to continue the fight

00:00:31.864 --> 00:00:33.433
to end police brutality.

00:00:33.466 --> 00:00:35.301
But not everybody enjoyed
the speech.

00:00:35.334 --> 00:00:37.103
This past weekend,
a petition demanding

00:00:37.136 --> 00:00:39.972
Jesse Williams be fired
from ABC's<i> Grey's Anatomy</i>

00:00:40.005 --> 00:00:43.042
collected
over 25,000 signatures.

00:00:43.075 --> 00:00:46.913
Wait, 25,000 white people
were watching the BET Awards?

00:00:46.946 --> 00:00:48.915
(cheering and applause)

00:00:48.948 --> 00:00:50.884
Damn!

00:00:53.185 --> 00:00:55.822
Here's a snippet
of the petition's description.

00:00:55.855 --> 00:00:59.425
"Jesse Williams released
a cascade

00:00:59.458 --> 00:01:02.228
"of inappropriate,
unprofessional,

00:01:02.261 --> 00:01:04.430
"and racist commentary

00:01:04.463 --> 00:01:07.967
"against police officers
and Caucasians.

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:13.239
"I have been watching all
of Shonda's shows since day one,

00:01:13.272 --> 00:01:16.242
"and it kills me
to take this stand,

00:01:16.275 --> 00:01:19.579
but it is a necessary evil."

00:01:19.612 --> 00:01:23.583
All of Shonda's shows
since day one? Really?

00:01:23.616 --> 00:01:25.284
Even<i> Off the Map?</i>

00:01:25.317 --> 00:01:27.920
You didn't even know
that was a Shonda show, did you?

00:01:27.953 --> 00:01:29.489
-(laughter)
-No!

00:01:29.522 --> 00:01:31.257
No one did.

00:01:31.290 --> 00:01:33.926
I guess you missed the<i> Grey's</i>
 episode about white privilege,

00:01:33.959 --> 00:01:36.195
or the Ferguson-inspired episode
of<i> Scandal,</i>

00:01:36.228 --> 00:01:37.830
or<i> How to Get Away with Murder</i>

00:01:37.863 --> 00:01:40.099
where Viola Davis takes off
her wig, which, to be fair,

00:01:40.132 --> 00:01:41.767
didn't really have anything
to do with racism,

00:01:41.800 --> 00:01:43.603
but that scene was
black as hell.

00:01:43.636 --> 00:01:46.539
(laughter,
applause and cheering)

00:01:46.572 --> 00:01:51.244
But then, Shonda hit the haters
with this tweet.

00:01:51.277 --> 00:01:53.079
"Um, people?
Boo don't need a petition.

00:01:53.112 --> 00:01:55.548
#shondalandrules."

00:01:55.581 --> 00:01:58.518
(applause and cheering)

00:02:00.386 --> 00:02:03.556
Now is she saying
"Shondaland rules,"

00:02:03.589 --> 00:02:06.058
or is she talking
about the rules of Shondaland?

00:02:06.091 --> 00:02:08.194
'Cause there are a lot
of rules in Shondaland.

00:02:08.227 --> 00:02:11.430
Like, no white after Labor Day
unless you're Olivia Pope.

00:02:11.463 --> 00:02:13.933
You will give Viola Davis
all the awards.

00:02:13.966 --> 00:02:15.668
And don't talk back to Shonda

00:02:15.701 --> 00:02:18.070
unless you want to end up doing
kitty litter commercials.

00:02:18.103 --> 00:02:20.139
I see you, Katherine Heigl.

00:02:20.172 --> 00:02:24.177
(laughter,
applause and cheering)

00:02:24.210 --> 00:02:28.181
But this comment
takes the loud and wrong cake.

00:02:28.214 --> 00:02:31.017
"Jesse Williams'
comments were racist,

00:02:31.050 --> 00:02:33.286
"and should be fired
from<i> Grey's Anatomy.</i>

00:02:33.319 --> 00:02:36.589
I will no longer watch
any Rhonda Rhimes show."

00:02:36.622 --> 00:02:38.824
(laughter)

00:02:38.857 --> 00:02:42.094
Ma'am, who is Rhonda Rhimes?!

00:02:42.127 --> 00:02:45.731
Is that a cross between
Ronda Rousey and LeAnn Rimes?

00:02:45.764 --> 00:02:47.867
(laughter)

00:02:47.900 --> 00:02:51.704
Oh, is this a show about
a kickboxing country singer?

00:02:51.737 --> 00:02:55.074
BET just got 25,000
more white viewers.

00:02:55.107 --> 00:02:58.010
(applause and cheering)

00:02:58.043 --> 00:03:01.781
Look, this entire petition
and everyone who signed it

00:03:01.814 --> 00:03:03.783
is a seven-layer bean dip
of nope.

00:03:03.816 --> 00:03:05.651
If you think speaking out

00:03:05.684 --> 00:03:07.987
against police brutality
is anti-cop,

00:03:08.020 --> 00:03:10.356
does that means killing
black people is pro-cop?

00:03:10.389 --> 00:03:12.358
Of course not!

00:03:12.391 --> 00:03:14.026
Jesse Williams
doesn't hate cops,

00:03:14.059 --> 00:03:15.695
and he doesn't hate
white people.

00:03:15.728 --> 00:03:17.396
He, like all of us should,

00:03:17.429 --> 00:03:19.699
hates the brutal murders
of black people by police

00:03:19.732 --> 00:03:22.335
who use their fear
to inform their force.

00:03:22.368 --> 00:03:25.305
(cheers and applause)

00:03:28.207 --> 00:03:31.377
Let's focus our anger
on the real issue.

00:03:31.410 --> 00:03:33.179
You want to fire Jesse Williams?

00:03:33.212 --> 00:03:35.314
How about we fire
all those racist cops

00:03:35.347 --> 00:03:37.383
and send their asses to jail?

00:03:37.416 --> 00:03:40.886
(applause and cheering)

00:03:40.919 --> 00:03:42.622
And let's...

00:03:42.655 --> 00:03:45.358
And let us let the good cops
do their jobs.

00:03:45.391 --> 00:03:49.629
-Yes. -Yeah.
-(applause and cheering)

00:03:49.662 --> 00:03:51.831
And Jesse can continue
to save lives

00:03:51.864 --> 00:03:54.400
and give me life
on Thursday nights.

00:03:54.433 --> 00:03:56.869
-(applause and cheering)
-Franchesca Ramsey, everybody!

00:03:56.902 --> 00:04:00.340
We'll be right back.
