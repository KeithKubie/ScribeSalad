00:00:05.371 --> 00:00:09.142 line:85%
RIGHT?  LET'S GET TO OUR STAR.

00:00:09.175 --> 00:00:12.712 align:start position:0% line:91%
YOU CALL WOMEN YOU DON'T LIKE
FAT PIGS, DOGS, SLOBS AND

&gt;&gt; WELL I WILL TELL YOU WHAT,
WITH HILLARY CLINTON I SAID BE

00:00:20.920 --> 00:00:23.356 align:start position:0% line:91%
AT MY WEDDING AND SHE CAME TO MY
WEDDING.

00:00:23.389 --> 00:00:25.992 align:start position:0% line:91%
I DON'T MIND HAVING A BIG
BEAUTIFUL DOOR ON THAT WALL SO

00:00:26.025 --> 00:00:31.030 align:start position:0% line:91%
THAT PEOPLE CAN COME INTO THIS
COUNTRY LEGALLY.

00:00:31.063 --> 00:00:34.100 line:91%
&gt;&gt; Larry: AND OF COURSE ABOVE
THAT DOOR IT SAYS DONALD TRUMP

00:00:34.133 --> 00:00:40.873 align:start position:0% line:91%
PRESENTS AMERICA, SOMEBODY'S
DOING THE RAPING.

00:00:40.906 --> 00:00:43.776 align:start position:0% line:85%
DONALD TRUMP DOOR.

00:00:43.809 --> 00:00:45.411 align:start position:0% line:91%
NOW, 24 MILLION PEOPLE TUNED IN
TO THIS DEBATE.

00:00:45.444 --> 00:00:46.846 align:start position:0% line:85%
AND LET'S BE HONEST.

00:00:46.879 --> 00:00:50.917 size:84% position:42% line:91%
MOST PEOPLE TUNED IN TO SEE
DONALD TRUMP BE ALL TRUMPY,

00:00:50.950 --> 00:00:54.387 size:88% position:44% line:91%
RIGHT?  I MEAN IT'S LIKE GOD
BESTOWED US WITH THIS MOST

00:00:54.420 --> 00:00:58.791 line:91%
FANTASTIC TROLL TO GILL THE DOG
DAYS OF SUMMER WITH GLORIOUS

00:00:58.824 --> 00:00:59.692 align:start position:0% line:85%
ENTERTAINMENT.

00:00:59.725 --> 00:01:01.360 align:start position:0% line:91%
IN FACT, HE EVEN LOOKS LIKE A
TROLL DOLL.

00:01:01.393 --> 00:01:02.228 align:start position:0% line:85%
LOOK AT HIS HAIR.

00:01:02.261 --> 00:01:07.266 line:85%
ALL RIGHT?  DOESN'T HE?  LOOK.

00:01:07.299 --> 00:01:08.401 align:start position:0% line:85%
I HAVE ONE RIGHT HERE.

00:01:08.434 --> 00:01:09.735 align:start position:0% line:85%
SEE, LOOK.

00:01:09.768 --> 00:01:17.610 line:85%
DOESN'T IT LOOK LIKE A TROLL?

00:01:17.643 --> 00:01:21.881 align:start position:0% line:91%
&gt;&gt; I AM THE MOST ENTERTAINING
MOST LOVEABLE TROLL EVER.

00:01:21.914 --> 00:01:22.415 align:start position:0% line:85%
OKAY.

00:01:22.448 --> 00:01:23.583 align:start position:0% line:85%
ALL RIGHT, ALL RIGHT.

00:01:23.616 --> 00:01:26.519 line:91%
AND LIKE THE REST OF US, THE
MEDIA DIDN'T PAY ATTENTION TO

00:01:26.552 --> 00:01:28.521 align:start position:0% line:91%
ANYTHING ELSE IN THE DEBATE
BESIDES TRUMP.

00:01:28.554 --> 00:01:30.990 align:start position:0% line:91%
AND ONE OF THE BIGGEST
ISSUES THEY FOCUSED ON WAS

00:01:31.023 --> 00:01:34.127 size:81% position:41% line:91%
TRUMP'S ANGER AT WHAT HE
PERCEIVED AS BEING TREATED

00:01:34.160 --> 00:01:38.131 align:start position:0% line:91%
UNFAIRLY, BY NONE OTHER THAN
FOX'S MEGYN KELLY.

00:01:38.164 --> 00:01:41.734 line:91%
YOU ONCE TOLD A CONTESTANT ON
CELEB APPRENTICE IT WOULD BE A

00:01:41.767 --> 00:01:43.936 align:start position:0% line:91%
PRETTY PICTURE TO SEE HER ON HER
KNEES.

00:01:43.969 --> 00:01:46.873 line:91%
DOES THAT SOUND TO YOU LIKE THE
TEMPERAMENT OF A MAN WE SHOULD

00:01:46.906 --> 00:01:48.141 align:start position:0% line:85%
ELECT AS PRESIDENT?

00:01:48.174 --> 00:01:51.777 line:91%
&gt;&gt; I THINK THE BIG PROBLEM THIS
COUNTRY HAS IS BEING POLITICALLY

00:01:51.810 --> 00:01:52.878 align:start position:0% line:85%
CORRECT.

00:01:52.911 --> 00:01:56.182 size:88% position:44% line:91%
AND, HONESTLY, MEGAN, IF YOU
DON'T LIKE IT, I AM SORRY.

00:01:56.215 --> 00:01:58.985 line:91%
I HAVE BEEN VERY NICE TO YOU,
ALTHOUGH I COULD PROBABLY MAYBE

00:01:59.018 --> 00:02:02.555 size:88% position:44% line:91%
NOT BE, BASED ON THE WAY YOU
HAVE TOO TREATED ME, BUT I

00:02:02.588 --> 00:02:03.956 align:start position:0% line:85%
WOULDN'T DO THAT.

00:02:03.989 --> 00:02:07.927 line:91%
&gt;&gt; Larry: SO HIS RESPONSE TO
BEING ACCUSED OF TREATING WOMEN

00:02:07.960 --> 00:02:11.998 align:start position:0% line:91%
POORLY ON TELEVISION IS A THINLY
VEILED THREAT TO A WOMAN ON

00:02:12.031 --> 00:02:13.166 align:start position:0% line:85%
TELEVISION?

00:02:13.199 --> 00:02:17.537 align:start position:0% line:91%
&gt;&gt; IN FRONT OF 24 MILLION
PEOPLE:I KNOW, A LOT OF PEOPLE.

00:02:17.570 --> 00:02:18.705 align:start position:0% line:85%
I GET IT.

00:02:18.738 --> 00:02:21.374 line:91%
OF COURSE, HE TALKED TO DON
LEMON THE NEXT DAY AND PRETTY

00:02:21.407 --> 00:02:22.608 line:85%
MUCH RIPPED THE VEIL RIGHT OFF.

00:02:22.642 --> 00:02:26.412 align:start position:0% line:91%
&gt;&gt; YOU COULD SEE THERE WAS BLOOD
COMING OUT OF HER EYES, BLOOD

00:02:26.445 --> 00:02:31.184 size:88% position:44% line:85%
COMING OUT OF HER, WHEREVER.

00:02:31.217 --> 00:02:36.255 align:start position:0% line:91%
&gt;&gt; Larry: HER WHEREVER? 
WHATEVER COULD YOU BE TALKING

00:02:36.288 --> 00:02:39.158 align:start position:0% line:91%
ABOUT?  ARE YOU TRYING TO
INSINUATE THAT MEGYN KELLY'S

00:02:39.191 --> 00:02:47.433 line:91%
"AUNT FLOW" WAS IN TOWN?  HMM? 
AND THAT'S WHY SHE WAS BEING SO

00:02:47.466 --> 00:02:53.773 align:start position:0% line:91%
MEAN TO YOU?  SO HERE WAS
TRUMP'S EXPLANATION.

00:02:53.806 --> 00:02:58.611 line:91%
&gt;&gt; I SAID HER BLOOD WAS WHEREVER
BECAUSE I WANTED TO FINISH THE

00:02:58.644 --> 00:03:03.049 line:91%
SENTENCE BECAUSE I WANTED TO GET
OFF THE WHOLE THING AND GET BACK

00:03:03.082 --> 00:03:07.053 size:88% position:44% line:91%
ON TO THE SUBJECT OF JOBS OR
WHATEVER I WAS GOING TO SAY

00:03:07.086 --> 00:03:12.525 line:91%
THOSE AND/OR, NOSE AND/OR EARS
BECAUSE THAT IS A VERY COMMON

00:03:12.558 --> 00:03:13.359 align:start position:0% line:85%
STATEMENT.

00:03:13.392 --> 00:03:14.727 align:start position:0% line:91%
BLOOD POURING OUT OF SOMEBODY'S
NOSE.

00:03:14.760 --> 00:03:18.130 align:start position:0% line:91%
&gt;&gt; I MEAN, EVEN DICK CHENEY
WOULD CLASSIFY THAT EXPLANATION

00:03:18.163 --> 00:03:20.700 align:start position:0% line:85%
AS TORTURED.

00:03:20.733 --> 00:03:24.403 align:start position:0% line:91%
SINCE WHEN IS SHE HAD BLOOD
COMING OUT OF HER EYES, NOSE AND

00:03:24.436 --> 00:03:29.375 size:88% position:44% line:91%
EARS A COMMON EXPRESSION?  I
HAVE BEEN WATCHING WHEEL OF

00:03:29.408 --> 00:03:32.712 align:start position:0% line:91%
FORTUNE FOR 30 YEARS AND I HAVE
NEVER SEEN THAT.

00:03:32.745 --> 00:03:33.379 align:start position:0% line:85%
NEVER.

00:03:33.413 --> 00:03:34.580 line:85%
I HAVE NEVER SEEN THAT, OKAY?

00:03:34.614 --> 00:03:38.150 align:start position:0% line:91%
&gt;&gt; I ALSO DON'T BUY TRUMP SAYING
HE WAS IN A RUSH TO GET THE

00:03:38.183 --> 00:03:40.519 line:91%
CONVERSATION ON TO JOBS, AND
THAT'S WHY HE SAID, WHEREVER.

00:03:40.552 --> 00:03:44.724 align:start position:0% line:91%
HOW IS SAYING WHEREVER FASTER
THAN SAYING NOSE?

00:03:44.757 --> 00:03:48.728 line:91%
&gt;&gt; WHEREVER IS TWICE AS LONG AS
NOSE, MORE THAN DOUBLE IF YOU

00:03:48.761 --> 00:03:54.433 align:start position:0% line:91%
THROW IN THE EXTRA E LIKE I
ALWAYS DO.

00:03:54.466 --> 00:03:57.837 line:91%
&gt;&gt; IT WOULD BE UNFAIR OF ME TO
AY DONALD TRUMP IS LYING, OKAY? 

00:03:57.870 --> 00:04:00.139 align:start position:0% line:91%
HERE IS WHAT I BELIEVE ABOUT
TRUMP.

00:04:00.172 --> 00:04:03.476 align:start position:0% line:91%
I BELIEVE TRUMP IS THE ONLY
PERSON WHO FULLY BELIEVES THINGS

00:04:03.509 --> 00:04:04.677 align:start position:0% line:85%
AFTER HE SAYS THEM.

00:04:04.710 --> 00:04:09.815 line:91%
ALL RIGHT?  I MEAN, I AM WORTH
$10 BILLION, YOU ARE WORTH 4.

00:04:09.848 --> 00:04:13.686 align:start position:0% line:91%
&gt;&gt; I SAID TEN, SO THAT'S WHAT I
BELIEVE.

00:04:13.719 --> 00:04:18.457 align:start position:0% line:91%
ALL RIGHT?  HE SAYS, THEREFORE
IT IS.

00:04:18.490 --> 00:04:22.061 line:91%
RIGHT?  FOR EXAMPLE, THE FALLOUT
FROM MEGYN KELLY'S MENSTRUATION

00:04:22.094 --> 00:04:23.295 align:start position:0% line:85%
GATE WAS IMMEDIATE.

00:04:23.329 --> 00:04:26.999 line:91%
RED STATE EDITOR ERICK ERICKSON
DISINVITED TRUMP FROM THE RED

00:04:27.032 --> 00:04:29.035 align:start position:0% line:91%
STATE GATHERING IN ATLANTA ON
SATURDAY.

00:04:29.068 --> 00:04:30.803 align:start position:0% line:85%
TRUMP'S RESPONSE?

00:04:30.836 --> 00:04:35.474 line:91%
&gt;&gt; FRANKLY, I DIDN'T WANT TO DO
HIS EVENT IN THE FIRST PLACE.

00:04:35.507 --> 00:04:36.542 align:start position:0% line:85%
&gt;&gt; THAT'S RIGHT, LARRY.

00:04:36.575 --> 00:04:38.377 align:start position:0% line:85%
I DIDN'T WANT TO DO IT.

00:04:38.410 --> 00:04:42.948 align:start position:0% line:91%
IT WAS MY PREDECISION THAT THEY
FULFILLED.

00:04:42.981 --> 00:04:47.019 line:91%
HE DID THE SAME THING WHEN NEIL
YOUNG TOLD HIM TO STOP USING HIS

00:04:47.052 --> 00:04:47.886 align:start position:0% line:85%
SONG AT EVENTS.

00:04:47.920 --> 00:04:51.457 align:start position:0% line:91%
&gt;&gt; I DON'T EVEN LIKE THAT SONG
THAT MUCH.

00:04:51.490 --> 00:04:54.960 align:start position:0% line:91%
&gt;&gt; YEP, THAT WAS A HORRIBLE SONG
I POST HATED.

00:04:54.993 --> 00:05:00.232 line:85%
YOU KNOW WHO TRUMP SOUNDS LIKE?

00:05:00.265 --> 00:05:04.870 align:start position:0% line:85%
&gt;&gt; I MEANT TO DO THAT.

00:05:04.903 --> 00:05:11.110 align:start position:0% line:91%
&gt;&gt; Larry: OF COURSE, LARRY, IT
ONLY MAKES SENSE.

00:05:11.143 --> 00:05:13.579 align:start position:0% line:85%
THIS IS UNBELIEVABLE.

00:05:13.612 --> 00:05:17.950 align:start position:0% line:91%
THE, AND THE CRAZIEST PART OF IT
IS, WITH ALL OF THIS NONSENSE

00:05:17.983 --> 00:05:19.952 align:start position:0% line:91%
YOU WOULD THINK TRUMP IS
SLIPPING IN THE POLLS, BUT NO.

00:05:19.985 --> 00:05:23.055 align:start position:0% line:91%
&gt;&gt;   DESPITE THE CONTROVERSY AND
HEADLINES A NEW POLL FINDS

00:05:23.088 --> 00:05:27.393 align:start position:0% line:91%
DONALD TRUMP IS STILL ON TOP
WITH REPUBLICAN VOTERS.

00:05:27.426 --> 00:05:32.932 line:91%

SENATOR TED CRUZ.

00:05:35.467 --> 00:05:39.839 align:start position:0% line:91%
&gt;&gt; Larry: I FIND IT RICHLY
IRONIC IT IS SURVEY MONKEY WHO

00:05:39.872 --> 00:05:41.340 line:85%
FINDS TRUMP ON TOP OF THE POLLS.

00:05:41.373 --> 00:05:47.213 align:start position:0% line:91%
IN FACT, WE ACTUALLY HAVE SURVEY
MONKEY LIVE VIA SATELLITE.

00:05:47.246 --> 00:05:54.120 align:start position:0% line:91%
SURVEY MONKEY, HOW DO YOU FEEL
ABOUT TRUMP SURGING IN THE

00:05:55.188 --> 00:06:02.561 align:start position:0% line:91%
&gt;&gt; SURVEY MONKEY, I THINK WE
LOST THE MONKEY FEED.

00:06:02.594 --> 00:06:06.332 line:91%

00:06:07.966 --> 00:06:09.034 align:start position:0% line:85%
OKAY.

00:06:09.067 --> 00:06:12.605 align:start position:0% line:91%
SO FAR, TRUMP HAS CALLED
MEXICANS RAPISTS AND ATTACKED

00:06:12.638 --> 00:06:16.675 line:91%
ONE OF AMERICA'S MOST BELOVED
POWS AND GAME OUT A SITTING

00:06:18.343 --> 00:06:23.549 align:start position:0% line:91%
AND NOW HE BASICALLY BLAMED A

00:06:23.582 --> 00:06:24.583 align:start position:0% line:85%
PERIOD.

00:06:24.617 --> 00:06:29.688 align:start position:0% line:91%

00:06:29.721 --> 00:06:33.459 align:start position:0% line:91%

ALL DOING A JOKE, WE WERE ALL
LAUGHING, HA, HA.

00:06:38.197 --> 00:06:39.799 align:start position:0% line:85%
