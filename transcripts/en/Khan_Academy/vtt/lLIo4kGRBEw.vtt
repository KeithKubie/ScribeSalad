00:00:00.620 --> 00:00:04.170
Let's do some problems that
involve subtracting fractions,

00:00:04.170 --> 00:00:05.760
or instead of saying fractions,
we could say

00:00:05.760 --> 00:00:08.710
rational numbers, either way.

00:00:08.710 --> 00:00:11.390
I'll do every other
of these up here.

00:00:11.390 --> 00:00:14.110
Let's start with b.

00:00:14.110 --> 00:00:18.540
We have 2/3 minus 1/4.

00:00:18.540 --> 00:00:21.220
Just as in the case with adding
fractions, you need to

00:00:21.220 --> 00:00:22.890
have a common denominator
here.

00:00:22.890 --> 00:00:24.960
You have to know how many
pieces of the pie we're

00:00:24.960 --> 00:00:26.200
dealing with.

00:00:26.200 --> 00:00:29.320
So the common denominator of 3
and 4, or the least common

00:00:29.320 --> 00:00:32.020
multiple of 3 and 4, the
smallest number that's

00:00:32.020 --> 00:00:35.180
divisible by both of
them, that's 12.

00:00:35.180 --> 00:00:37.240
So let me write it this way.

00:00:37.240 --> 00:00:37.900
Let me do it this way.

00:00:37.900 --> 00:00:39.310
This will be more fun.

00:00:39.310 --> 00:00:46.390
2/3, if we write 12 in the
denominator, 3 times 4 is 12,

00:00:46.390 --> 00:00:49.680
so 2 times 4 is 8.

00:00:49.680 --> 00:00:51.230
These are equivalent.

00:00:51.230 --> 00:00:54.330
We multiplied the numerator
and the denominator by 4.

00:00:54.330 --> 00:00:58.520
And then 1/4, if we put
12 in the denominator,

00:00:58.520 --> 00:01:01.310
4 times 3 is 12.

00:01:01.310 --> 00:01:04.080
1 times 3 is 3.

00:01:04.080 --> 00:01:06.400
3/12 and 1/4 are
the same thing.

00:01:06.400 --> 00:01:08.700
And we have a minus
sign right there.

00:01:08.700 --> 00:01:12.710
So this is going to be equal to
8 minus 3 over 12, now that

00:01:12.710 --> 00:01:14.660
we have our common denominator,

00:01:14.660 --> 00:01:18.450
which is equal to 5/12.

00:01:18.450 --> 00:01:23.960
Now let's do d.

00:01:23.960 --> 00:01:25.210
Let me do it in a
different color.

00:01:27.680 --> 00:01:34.980
15 over 11, 15/11 minus 9/7.

00:01:34.980 --> 00:01:38.140
Let's get a common
denominator.

00:01:38.140 --> 00:01:40.810
Let's see, between 11 and 7, I
think 77 is going to be the

00:01:40.810 --> 00:01:42.380
first number you're going
to find that is

00:01:42.380 --> 00:01:43.180
divisible by both.

00:01:43.180 --> 00:01:44.860
You just multiply the two.

00:01:44.860 --> 00:01:47.170
So you have 77.

00:01:47.170 --> 00:01:51.390
To go from 11 to 77, you have
to multiply it by 7.

00:01:51.390 --> 00:01:57.230
So 15 times 7 is 70 plus 35.

00:01:57.230 --> 00:02:01.000
That is 105.

00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:04.930
And then we have
minus over 77.

00:02:04.930 --> 00:02:07.400
7 times 11 is 77.

00:02:07.400 --> 00:02:11.730
9 times 11 is 99.

00:02:11.730 --> 00:02:18.170
So 105 minus-- this is going
to be 105 minus 99 over 77.

00:02:18.170 --> 00:02:19.840
What's 105 minus 99?

00:02:19.840 --> 00:02:23.620
It is 6, and we are done.

00:02:23.620 --> 00:02:24.800
You can't reduce
this any more.

00:02:24.800 --> 00:02:29.390
6 and 77 aren't divisible by--
don't have any common factors.

00:02:29.390 --> 00:02:33.220
Let's do f.

00:02:33.220 --> 00:02:36.470
Let me do it in a new color.

00:02:36.470 --> 00:02:46.640
So f has us doing
7/27 minus 9/39.

00:02:46.640 --> 00:02:51.200
All right, so what is the
common denominator here?

00:02:51.200 --> 00:02:52.480
And actually, there's
something we

00:02:52.480 --> 00:02:54.440
might be able to simplify.

00:02:54.440 --> 00:02:57.460
We might be able to simplify
this a little bit.

00:02:57.460 --> 00:03:00.170
9/39, they're both
divisible by 3.

00:03:00.170 --> 00:03:06.220
So I can rewrite 9/39 as divide
9 by 3, it becomes 3.

00:03:06.220 --> 00:03:10.290
You divide 39 by 3,
it becomes 13.

00:03:10.290 --> 00:03:15.360
So this becomes 7/27
minus 3/13.

00:03:15.360 --> 00:03:18.850
So what's the common denominator
between 27 and 13?

00:03:18.850 --> 00:03:20.650
Well, they don't have any common
factors, so we're just

00:03:20.650 --> 00:03:22.330
going to have to multiply
the two.

00:03:22.330 --> 00:03:25.290
So let's see, 27 times 13--
let me do it over on

00:03:25.290 --> 00:03:26.290
the side over here.

00:03:26.290 --> 00:03:30.690
So 27 times 13.

00:03:30.690 --> 00:03:37.370
3 times 7 is 21, carry the 2,
3 times 2 is 6 plus 2 is 8.

00:03:37.370 --> 00:03:38.660
Let's put the 0 down here.

00:03:38.660 --> 00:03:40.160
1 times 7 is 7.

00:03:40.160 --> 00:03:42.600
1 times 2 is 2.

00:03:42.600 --> 00:03:44.000
And we add.

00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:45.210
1 plus 0 is 1.

00:03:45.210 --> 00:03:49.650
8 plus 7 is 15.

00:03:49.650 --> 00:03:52.170
1 plus 2 is 3.

00:03:52.170 --> 00:03:57.160
So our common denominator
is going to be 351 minus

00:03:57.160 --> 00:04:00.560
something over 351.

00:04:00.560 --> 00:04:05.480
To go from 27 to 351, we
have to multiply by 13.

00:04:05.480 --> 00:04:08.422
So to go from 7 to whatever
numerator here, we're going to

00:04:08.422 --> 00:04:09.750
have to multiply by 13.

00:04:09.750 --> 00:04:14.930
7 times 13 is 70,
plus 21 is 91.

00:04:14.930 --> 00:04:17.310
This is 91/351.

00:04:17.310 --> 00:04:23.650
And to go from this 13 to 351,
we have to multiply by 27.

00:04:23.650 --> 00:04:26.810
So on the numerator, we have
to multiply by 27.

00:04:26.810 --> 00:04:33.140
3 times 27, that is 60
plus 21, that is 81.

00:04:33.140 --> 00:04:39.830
And so our answer is going
to be over 351.

00:04:39.830 --> 00:04:43.550
91 minus 81, well,
that's just 10.

00:04:43.550 --> 00:04:45.230
And then we are done.

00:04:45.230 --> 00:04:46.960
And then let's do one more.

00:04:46.960 --> 00:04:49.420
These are getting a little
hairy, but we can power

00:04:49.420 --> 00:04:50.470
through them.

00:04:50.470 --> 00:05:02.380
h says 13/64 minus 7/40.

00:05:02.380 --> 00:05:06.980
So let's get a common
denominator between 64 and 40.

00:05:06.980 --> 00:05:09.380
So 80 won't work.

00:05:09.380 --> 00:05:12.360
We could actually try to--
actually, let's do this the

00:05:12.360 --> 00:05:13.150
old-fashioned way.

00:05:13.150 --> 00:05:14.990
Let's look at the factors.

00:05:14.990 --> 00:05:18.655
Let's look at the prime
factorization of the two and

00:05:18.655 --> 00:05:20.580
then we could find the least
common multiple.

00:05:20.580 --> 00:05:21.720
So this'll be interesting.

00:05:21.720 --> 00:05:29.780
So 64-- let me do it in a
different color here-- 64, we

00:05:29.780 --> 00:05:34.340
can factor that as 2 times 32,
which is the same thing as 2

00:05:34.340 --> 00:05:40.260
times 16, which is the same
thing as 2 times 8, which is

00:05:40.260 --> 00:05:43.030
the same thing as 2 times
4, which is the same

00:05:43.030 --> 00:05:48.410
thing as 2 times 2.

00:05:48.410 --> 00:05:51.540
So this is 2 times itself,
one, two, three,

00:05:51.540 --> 00:05:54.500
four, five, six times.

00:05:54.500 --> 00:05:59.250
So we could say 64 is the same
thing as 2 times 2 times 2

00:05:59.250 --> 00:06:01.560
times 2 times 2 times 2.

00:06:01.560 --> 00:06:02.740
If you know exponents,
this is the same

00:06:02.740 --> 00:06:04.210
thing as 2 to the sixth.

00:06:04.210 --> 00:06:06.340
That's 64.

00:06:06.340 --> 00:06:09.730
Now, 40 you do the same thing.

00:06:09.730 --> 00:06:13.690
40-- let me do that in
a different color.

00:06:13.690 --> 00:06:22.560
40 is 2 times 20, which is 2
times 10, which is 2 times 5.

00:06:22.560 --> 00:06:28.480
So 40 is 2 times 2 times 2
times 2 times 2 times 5.

00:06:28.480 --> 00:06:31.220
This is the prime factorization
of 40.

00:06:31.220 --> 00:06:36.280
Now, if we compare the two, this
2 times 2 times 2, this

00:06:36.280 --> 00:06:39.180
is inside of 64.

00:06:39.180 --> 00:06:41.040
So in order to find the least
common multiple, we don't have

00:06:41.040 --> 00:06:43.260
a 5 in the prime factorization
of 64.

00:06:43.260 --> 00:06:45.230
We have the 2 times 2 times 2.

00:06:45.230 --> 00:06:48.990
So to get there, the least
common multiple of these will

00:06:48.990 --> 00:06:52.100
be if we just multiply
this times 5.

00:06:52.100 --> 00:06:55.740
So we take 64 and we multiply it
times 5 because this number

00:06:55.740 --> 00:07:01.670
now is going to have 64 in it,
that's 64, and it's also going

00:07:01.670 --> 00:07:04.470
to have 40 in it right there.

00:07:04.470 --> 00:07:06.980
So 64 times 5.

00:07:06.980 --> 00:07:10.440
So what is 64 times 5?

00:07:10.440 --> 00:07:14.900
So if we take 64-- I'm running
out of real estate; let me

00:07:14.900 --> 00:07:22.990
scroll over to the right--
so 64 times 5 is 320.

00:07:22.990 --> 00:07:28.760
So it's 320, so that
is times 5.

00:07:28.760 --> 00:07:30.660
So if we multiply 64
times 5, we have to

00:07:30.660 --> 00:07:32.280
multiply 13 times 5.

00:07:32.280 --> 00:07:36.380
So that's 50 plus 15.

00:07:36.380 --> 00:07:42.070
13 times 5, so it's
65, so that is 65.

00:07:42.070 --> 00:07:50.050
And then to go from 40 to 320,
we have to multiply by 8.

00:07:50.050 --> 00:07:50.940
And you could see that there.

00:07:50.940 --> 00:07:53.870
You have this other three 2's,
2 to the third power.

00:07:53.870 --> 00:07:56.730
So we have to multiply
it by 8 over here.

00:07:56.730 --> 00:08:02.350
So 7 times 8 is 56.

00:08:02.350 --> 00:08:14.170
So we have a minus 56 is equal
to 65 minus 56 is 9, is equal

00:08:14.170 --> 00:08:18.600
to 9 over 320.

00:08:18.600 --> 00:08:20.100
That was a little bit of a hairy
problem, but we were

00:08:20.100 --> 00:08:21.210
able to power through it.

00:08:21.210 --> 00:08:26.400
Let's do this last problem
down here.

00:08:26.400 --> 00:08:29.720
Consider the equation
2/3x plus 1/2.

00:08:29.720 --> 00:08:34.770
All right, y is equal
to 2/3x plus 1/2.

00:08:34.770 --> 00:08:37.880
Determine the change in y
between x is equal to 1 and x

00:08:37.880 --> 00:08:39.330
is equal to 2.

00:08:39.330 --> 00:08:40.340
All right.

00:08:40.340 --> 00:08:44.630
When x-- let's make little
table: x and y.

00:08:44.630 --> 00:08:46.950
When x is equal to
1, what is y?

00:08:46.950 --> 00:08:54.400
It's 2/3 times 1 plus 1/2, which
is equal to 2/3 plus

00:08:54.400 --> 00:08:58.040
1/2, which is equal to a common
denominator of 6.

00:08:58.040 --> 00:09:05.680
2/3 is 4/6-- multiply both of
them by 2-- plus 1/2 is 3/6.

00:09:05.680 --> 00:09:07.055
So this is equal to 7/6.

00:09:09.770 --> 00:09:10.270
All right.

00:09:10.270 --> 00:09:12.880
When x is equal to 2.

00:09:12.880 --> 00:09:19.880
When x is equal to 2, you have
2/3 times 2 plus 1/2, so it's

00:09:19.880 --> 00:09:26.470
going to be equal to 4/3 plus
1/2, which is equal to a

00:09:26.470 --> 00:09:28.290
common denominator of 6.

00:09:28.290 --> 00:09:35.620
This is equal to 8/6-- 3 times
2 is 6; 4 times 2 is 8-- plus

00:09:35.620 --> 00:09:39.570
3/6, which is equal to 11/6.

00:09:39.570 --> 00:09:43.030
And they say determine the
change in y between x equal 1

00:09:43.030 --> 00:09:44.000
and x equal to 2.

00:09:44.000 --> 00:09:47.330
So how much larger is this--
this is our new y when x is

00:09:47.330 --> 00:09:49.850
equal to 2-- relative to this?

00:09:49.850 --> 00:10:00.690
So we could take our 11/6 minus
7/6, and our change in y

00:10:00.690 --> 00:10:06.440
between x is equal to 1 and x is
equal to 2, 11 minus 7 is 4

00:10:06.440 --> 00:10:09.570
over 6, which is equal to 2/3.

00:10:09.570 --> 00:10:12.800
And that makes complete sense
because every time you

00:10:12.800 --> 00:10:16.260
increase x by 1, you're
increasing this expression by

00:10:16.260 --> 00:10:17.490
another 2/3.

00:10:17.490 --> 00:10:20.435
When you go from 1 to 2, you
should increase by 2/3.
