00:00:07.480 --> 00:00:08.060
JESSICA: Hi.

00:00:08.060 --> 00:00:08.630
I'm Jessica.

00:00:08.630 --> 00:00:10.755
And today, I'm going to be
talking about a chemical

00:00:10.755 --> 00:00:16.300
demonstration I like to
call " "Mirror, Mirror."

00:00:16.300 --> 00:00:18.820
In this demo, MIT'S
Dr. John Dolhun

00:00:18.820 --> 00:00:22.480
will demonstrate Tollens'
Test, a chemical test created

00:00:22.480 --> 00:00:27.610
by this man, Bernhard
Tollens, a German chemist born

00:00:27.610 --> 00:00:29.500
in the late 1800s.

00:00:29.500 --> 00:00:32.530
So let's watch Dr. Dolhun
perform this demonstration here

00:00:32.530 --> 00:00:34.915
at MIT as part of the
Cambridge Science Festival.

00:00:35.650 --> 00:00:39.010
JOHN DOLHUN: OK, so I'm
going to be careful.

00:00:39.010 --> 00:00:45.145
And I'm going to pour my first
substance into the flask.

00:00:58.080 --> 00:01:06.070
My second substance,
down to the last drop.

00:01:15.380 --> 00:01:17.060
And my third substance.

00:01:27.920 --> 00:01:34.900
And we're going to
do a little shaking.

00:01:34.900 --> 00:01:36.350
We're mixing some
things together.

00:01:42.400 --> 00:01:44.590
JESSICA: So what
did Dr. Dolhun do?

00:01:44.590 --> 00:01:47.770
Well, he added three
solutions to the flask.

00:01:47.770 --> 00:01:52.620
Solution 1 was glucose in water.

00:01:52.620 --> 00:01:55.770
Solution 2 was a mixture of
silver nitrate and ammonium

00:01:55.770 --> 00:01:57.700
nitrate.

00:01:57.700 --> 00:02:01.660
And Solution 3 was sodium
hydroxide, which is a base.

00:02:01.660 --> 00:02:05.070
So let's focus on the
second two solutions first.

00:02:05.070 --> 00:02:08.740
When you mix solutions 2
and 3, two things happen.

00:02:08.740 --> 00:02:15.000
First, you form Ag2O, which
is insoluble in water.

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:17.370
So it precipitates
out as a brown solid.

00:02:21.010 --> 00:02:25.380
The sodium hydroxide reacts
with ammonium and H4 plus

00:02:25.380 --> 00:02:27.140
to produce ammonia, NH3.

00:02:30.160 --> 00:02:31.930
This dissolves the precipitate.

00:02:31.930 --> 00:02:39.760
And you end up with Ag(NH3)2,
which all has a positive

00:02:39.760 --> 00:02:41.330
charge.

00:02:41.330 --> 00:02:44.500
This is soluble in water, and
it's called Tollens Reagent.

00:02:47.890 --> 00:02:50.510
Now, the positive charge
is borne by the silver.

00:02:50.510 --> 00:02:55.000
So what we have in solution
is essentially silver ions.

00:02:55.000 --> 00:02:59.710
Now looking at Solution 1,
glucose looks like this.

00:03:03.570 --> 00:03:07.680
We don't really care about this
whole part of the molecule.

00:03:07.680 --> 00:03:10.740
So we're going to call
it R for "the rest."

00:03:13.890 --> 00:03:15.850
So glucose is basically this.

00:03:18.910 --> 00:03:20.770
And this part of
the glucose is going

00:03:20.770 --> 00:03:23.830
to start reacting
with the silver ions.

00:03:23.830 --> 00:03:26.497
Let's watch what happens.

00:03:26.497 --> 00:03:28.330
JOHN DOLHUN: I don't
see anything happening.

00:03:28.330 --> 00:03:30.400
Do you?

00:03:30.400 --> 00:03:35.590
OK, still working on it.

00:03:35.590 --> 00:03:36.928
I'm getting tired here.

00:03:40.680 --> 00:03:41.942
Something happening?

00:03:49.702 --> 00:03:50.618
AUDIENCE: It's silver.

00:03:50.618 --> 00:03:51.590
It's

00:03:51.590 --> 00:03:53.548
JOHN DOLHUN: Oh, my
goodness, I can see myself.

00:04:07.070 --> 00:04:11.050
Well, this is a real
workout, I'll tell you.

00:04:15.660 --> 00:04:20.010
So what we've created
here is a beautiful silver

00:04:20.010 --> 00:04:20.849
mirrored flask.

00:04:25.029 --> 00:04:26.070
JESSICA: So look at that.

00:04:26.070 --> 00:04:29.670
Dr. Dolhun has created a
beautiful silver mirror.

00:04:29.670 --> 00:04:31.830
It almost looks like a
Christmas tree ornament.

00:04:31.830 --> 00:04:35.070
And a silver ornament could,
in fact, be made this way.

00:04:35.070 --> 00:04:36.810
So here's what's happening.

00:04:36.810 --> 00:04:38.940
Electrons from
here, the glucose,

00:04:38.940 --> 00:04:42.610
get transferred to the silver,
reducing it to silver zero.

00:04:47.510 --> 00:04:49.850
Silver zero is
insoluble in water.

00:04:49.850 --> 00:04:55.160
It's just silver metal,
and it's precipitating out

00:04:55.160 --> 00:04:58.310
on the inside of the flask,
forming the beautiful silver

00:04:58.310 --> 00:05:00.080
mirror that we see.

00:05:00.080 --> 00:05:03.680
Now, this process is
called "reduction."

00:05:03.680 --> 00:05:05.510
And whenever
something is reduced,

00:05:05.510 --> 00:05:07.730
something else is oxidized.

00:05:07.730 --> 00:05:10.970
So the glucose must
be getting oxidized.

00:05:10.970 --> 00:05:12.110
It becomes this.

00:05:15.960 --> 00:05:18.550
An oxygen was added here.

00:05:18.550 --> 00:05:22.240
Now, this process is similar
to metabolism in our bodies.

00:05:22.240 --> 00:05:24.700
We remove electrons
from the sugar we eat,

00:05:24.700 --> 00:05:27.880
and transfer them to the
oxygen that we breathe.

00:05:27.880 --> 00:05:30.400
In a reduction reaction
like mirror, mirror,

00:05:30.400 --> 00:05:32.410
there might be energy released.

00:05:32.410 --> 00:05:35.830
In your body, this energy is
harnessed in chemical bonds,

00:05:35.830 --> 00:05:37.780
stored for later.

00:05:37.780 --> 00:05:41.320
The point of Tollens' Test was
not to produce silver mirrors,

00:05:41.320 --> 00:05:44.200
although a similar reaction
is used for that today.

00:05:44.200 --> 00:05:47.750
The point was to distinguish
between two types of sugars--

00:05:47.750 --> 00:05:51.190
ones containing aldehyde
and ones containing ketones.

00:05:51.190 --> 00:05:52.030
Let me draw those.

00:05:57.130 --> 00:05:59.050
The difference is
that in an aldehyde,

00:05:59.050 --> 00:06:02.740
the carbon is connected to
a hydrogen. And in a ketone,

00:06:02.740 --> 00:06:05.650
the carbon is connected
to another carbon.

00:06:05.650 --> 00:06:08.110
Aldehydes are more
reactive than ketones,

00:06:08.110 --> 00:06:10.360
so they will react
with the silver ions,

00:06:10.360 --> 00:06:12.412
while the ketones will not.

00:06:12.412 --> 00:06:13.120
That's it for me.

00:06:13.120 --> 00:06:14.560
Hopefully, you
enjoyed this video.

00:06:14.560 --> 00:06:17.320
And I will see you next time.
