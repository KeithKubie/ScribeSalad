00:00:02.369 --> 00:00:06.039
BRITT: Patagonia I
had the fish fridge.

00:00:06.039 --> 00:00:10.443
I'm gonna seal it off, kind
of like a grate, just to keep

00:00:10.443 --> 00:00:12.746
anything from
getting down into it,

00:00:12.746 --> 00:00:15.448
keep them from washing away.

00:00:15.448 --> 00:00:19.686
Here, I have the
fish holding tank.

00:00:19.686 --> 00:00:22.322
I'll probably eat one
tonight, and then I'll

00:00:22.322 --> 00:00:24.724
save the rest for tomorrow.

00:00:24.724 --> 00:00:29.796
But I have them in this little
tiny isolated wading pool.

00:00:29.796 --> 00:00:32.465
Look at that one.

00:00:32.465 --> 00:00:34.667
Nice, huh?

00:00:34.667 --> 00:00:36.669
So they're just here
whenever I want them.

00:00:40.740 --> 00:00:43.643
[music playing]

00:00:57.690 --> 00:01:01.161
I hope the fish in my
holding tank are alive.

00:01:01.161 --> 00:01:02.128
They should be.

00:01:02.128 --> 00:01:04.230
They should be fine.

00:01:04.230 --> 00:01:07.066
I'll take one out this
morning, probably,

00:01:07.066 --> 00:01:10.036
cook up a fish for breakfast.

00:01:10.036 --> 00:01:12.972
Get a little protein
to start my day.

00:01:12.972 --> 00:01:14.207
I can't wait.

00:01:18.178 --> 00:01:22.515
[music playing]

00:01:22.515 --> 00:01:25.885
Oh [bleep].

00:01:25.885 --> 00:01:27.187
[bleep] kidding me?

00:01:30.890 --> 00:01:35.195
So I just got some really,
really disappointing news.

00:01:35.195 --> 00:01:42.402
I came back to my wading
pool, and every fish is gone.

00:01:45.972 --> 00:01:47.774
That was foolish of me.

00:01:47.774 --> 00:01:49.142
Of course there's
predators in the area.

00:01:49.142 --> 00:01:50.710
Of course they're
gonna find these fish

00:01:50.710 --> 00:01:52.779
in this little shallow pond.

00:01:52.779 --> 00:01:56.449
I probably had five
pounds of fish in here.

00:01:56.449 --> 00:02:06.392
And I can see blood,
pieces of fish.

00:02:06.392 --> 00:02:08.595
I mean, they were
just easy pickings.

00:02:08.595 --> 00:02:11.331
That was dumb.

00:02:11.331 --> 00:02:13.333
I just fed a whole
family of something.

00:02:16.836 --> 00:02:17.437
Damn.

00:02:23.710 --> 00:02:27.480
And it's too rocky
here to see any tracks.

00:02:27.480 --> 00:02:29.115
My guess is that it's wolves.

00:02:29.115 --> 00:02:29.849
Could have been anything.

00:02:34.153 --> 00:02:36.489
[bleep]

00:02:36.489 --> 00:02:38.324
It's beyond disappointing.

00:02:42.662 --> 00:02:43.863
Oh well.

00:02:43.863 --> 00:02:45.798
I guess that's a step
down from the fish fridge,

00:02:45.798 --> 00:02:50.036
because I just
got totally taken.

00:02:50.036 --> 00:02:53.006
In a survival situation, every
bit of protein that I can get

00:02:53.006 --> 00:02:54.807
is vital.

00:02:54.807 --> 00:02:56.476
Stupid, stupid, stupid.

00:02:59.479 --> 00:03:01.381
Oh well.

00:03:01.381 --> 00:03:02.682
It's in the past now.

00:03:02.682 --> 00:03:05.051
What am I gonna
do about it, cry?

00:03:05.051 --> 00:03:07.287
Right now, this is redemption.

00:03:07.287 --> 00:03:13.426
So whether it be I'm starving
to death or I'm injured,

00:03:13.426 --> 00:03:16.763
I'm not taking myself
out of this competition.

00:03:16.763 --> 00:03:18.932
I'll get over it.

00:03:18.932 --> 00:03:19.933
I'm over it right now.
