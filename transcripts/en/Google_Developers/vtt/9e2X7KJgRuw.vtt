VERA KOPP: inCast is a
crowdsourcing platform

00:00:07.590 --> 00:00:09.750
to connect entertainment
professionals.

00:00:09.750 --> 00:00:12.690
It's a place where producers
can post notices and look

00:00:12.690 --> 00:00:14.990
for talent and talent can
look for opportunities.

00:00:19.480 --> 00:00:22.550
Building a marketing plan
for me wasn't so difficult

00:00:22.550 --> 00:00:24.780
since I'm in the industry.

00:00:24.780 --> 00:00:27.260
I have a lot of
connections with producers,

00:00:27.260 --> 00:00:29.830
big production
companies in Brazil,

00:00:29.830 --> 00:00:31.060
as well as broadcasters.

00:00:31.060 --> 00:00:33.350
I have produced
content in Hollywood

00:00:33.350 --> 00:00:35.150
and sold it to Brazil.

00:00:35.150 --> 00:00:40.280
So I think, mainly, your
roots and your network

00:00:40.280 --> 00:00:45.290
is step number one for marketing
and acquisition of clients.

00:00:45.290 --> 00:00:48.580
I know for sure that
a lot of those people

00:00:48.580 --> 00:00:51.760
will be my testing sample.

00:00:51.760 --> 00:00:55.030
And I will absorb every
single information from them

00:00:55.030 --> 00:00:59.410
to, you know, change inCast
and customize to their needs.

00:00:59.410 --> 00:01:00.890
I think that's very important.

00:01:00.890 --> 00:01:02.820
Adjusting the product
to your demographic.

00:01:07.210 --> 00:01:09.800
I think a great
example of, you know,

00:01:09.800 --> 00:01:12.600
getting the feedback
from this experience

00:01:12.600 --> 00:01:17.000
is just as simple as
that main landing page.

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:21.930
We were trying to convey our
company message versus focusing

00:01:21.930 --> 00:01:26.320
on our mission and the
problem that we're solving.

00:01:26.320 --> 00:01:29.840
So we didn't have too much
call to action buttons.

00:01:29.840 --> 00:01:33.490
And people can't
guess where they are

00:01:33.490 --> 00:01:34.500
and what they're doing.

00:01:34.500 --> 00:01:37.580
I think that the experience has
to be, like, a little bit more

00:01:37.580 --> 00:01:39.280
seamless.

00:01:39.280 --> 00:01:42.470
So putting bigger buttons
and conveying your message

00:01:42.470 --> 00:01:45.120
a little bit more
clearer, that's

00:01:45.120 --> 00:01:47.940
what I'm ready to do right now.
