00:00:00.330 --> 00:00:03.160
We've created several resources and
have assembled a team of

00:00:03.160 --> 00:00:06.810
iOS developers to assist you in
building your portfolio of apps.

00:00:06.810 --> 00:00:10.730
Links to each of these resources can
be found in the notes below this video.

00:00:10.730 --> 00:00:12.510
&gt;&gt; First is the Udacity form.

00:00:12.510 --> 00:00:14.270
This will be your primary resource for

00:00:14.270 --> 00:00:18.300
seeking help on topics related to
our courses and your portfolio apps.

00:00:18.300 --> 00:00:20.250
You'd actually coaches-
&gt;&gt; Like us.

00:00:20.250 --> 00:00:23.690
&gt;&gt; And mentors regularly visit the form
to answer student questions and

00:00:23.690 --> 00:00:25.210
provide guidance.

00:00:25.210 --> 00:00:29.210
You may also find yourself helping other
students on the form from time to time.

00:00:29.210 --> 00:00:30.940
A link to the form is provided below.

00:00:30.940 --> 00:00:32.560
We recommend bookmarking this link.

00:00:33.710 --> 00:00:36.770
&gt;&gt; Next, our one on one appointments
with the Udacity mentors.

00:00:36.770 --> 00:00:40.060
Sometimes it's easier or
more helpful to speak with someone.

00:00:40.060 --> 00:00:43.350
When that's the case, feel free to
schedule an appointment for a voice or

00:00:43.350 --> 00:00:45.160
video chat with one of our mentors.

00:00:45.160 --> 00:00:46.410
They're eager to help.

00:00:46.410 --> 00:00:48.890
&gt;&gt; If you prefer text chat,
we have a select channel for

00:00:48.890 --> 00:00:51.130
all of our current and former students.

00:00:51.130 --> 00:00:53.790
This is another great way to
connect with your peers and

00:00:53.790 --> 00:00:55.970
get the answer to a tough question.

00:00:55.970 --> 00:00:57.235
&gt;&gt; When you're ready
to start looking for

00:00:57.235 --> 00:01:00.720
iOS development jobs, we've assembled
a wealth of resources to assist you at

00:01:00.720 --> 00:01:02.980
the Udacity Career Resource Center.

00:01:02.980 --> 00:01:05.880
You will also be completing several
career projects as you progress through

00:01:05.880 --> 00:01:07.970
the Nano degree, that will help
you polish your resume and

00:01:07.970 --> 00:01:10.840

interviews.

00:01:13.850 --> 00:01:16.190
