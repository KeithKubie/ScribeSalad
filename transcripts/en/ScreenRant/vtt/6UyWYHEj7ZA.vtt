00:00:03.459 --> 00:00:09.329
The amount of craftsmanship and attention to detail that goes into perfecting animated films is in a class of its own

00:00:09.760 --> 00:00:16.229
Every tiny detail from Movement to background objects has to be rendered and programmed to add naturally and to stay consistent

00:00:16.420 --> 00:00:19.590
Throughout the length of the picture "Is that right?"

00:00:19.960 --> 00:00:22.890
It's no wonder that most of these films have received high praise

00:00:23.040 --> 00:00:28.100
from critics and Award shows alike and have earned fond memories from Children and adults alike

00:00:28.880 --> 00:00:36.500
"Ahhhh, Pah Poy!"   That's why when a mistake makes its way into the final product, fans may never be able to look at that scene again without seeing

00:00:36.500 --> 00:00:41.600
the mistake. Here are 10 obvious mistakes we never noticed in our favorite animated movies.

00:00:41.649 --> 00:00:43.480

00:00:53.780 --> 00:00:57.800
"Umm. I think so.." Boy, have we got some good news for you then.

00:00:57.809 --> 00:01:02.909
Stay tuned for some awesome info about an awesome game called War Robots.

00:01:03.399 --> 00:01:09.899
And before we start, can you guess this movie from these emojis? Stay tuned for the answer at the end of our video.

00:01:10.060 --> 00:01:13.160
"You kind of set off an eternal winter everywhere."

00:01:14.080 --> 00:01:16.980
"Everywhere?" " It's okay. You can just unfreeze it."

00:01:17.680 --> 00:01:24.599
Frozen: Let It Go, am I right people? Well, that may be what the animators did with this once-you-see-it mistake. In the

00:01:24.600 --> 00:01:28.619
mega-hit film from Disney, Elsa runs away from home to the Snowy Mountains and

00:01:28.780 --> 00:01:33.390
bursts into the song "Let It Go" as she changes into her ice-queen form for the rest of the movie.

00:01:33.640 --> 00:01:34.900
During the number however,

00:01:34.900 --> 00:01:41.249
Elsa lets her hair down in a fashion that straight up defies physics as her hair braid passes directly through her arm.

00:01:41.470 --> 00:01:47.819
We knew Elsa has some crazy powers, but we didn't know she could influence matter. That is seriously impressive.

00:01:47.820 --> 00:01:50.759
"Oh, no! We're crying at school!"

00:01:52.210 --> 00:01:57.930
Inside out: you're probably more familiar with the case of Riley's mother and the teleporting glasses

00:01:57.930 --> 00:02:02.790
But there's another animation mistake in the oscar-winning picture by Pixar that you may not have noticed.

00:02:02.950 --> 00:02:10.190
"Are you kidding me? Out of the gate? This is not happening!" When sadness accidentally causes Riley to cry in class, fans may

00:02:10.569 --> 00:02:17.919
have noticed that something else was amiss. On her desk, Riley has a couple of notebooks which somehow end up shuffling around on their own

00:02:17.920 --> 00:02:24.129
Throughout the scene. Ironically the color of one of her notebooks is blue which fits nicely with the theme of Sadness.

00:02:25.400 --> 00:02:27.260
The Road to Eldorado:

00:02:27.260 --> 00:02:33.670
After being stuck at sea, the con artists Tulio and Miguel are finally spared when they spy land in the distance.

00:02:34.069 --> 00:02:39.399
Overjoyed that they're not going to die in their tiny boat and the company of their horse, the two men begin

00:02:39.530 --> 00:02:42.369
praising the sand, even going as far as kissing it.

00:02:42.370 --> 00:02:44.620
It's quickly revealed that there are skulls

00:02:44.719 --> 00:02:50.108
littering the beach that they landed on. Yet, in a wide shot that was shown moments before the reveal of skeletons,

00:02:50.109 --> 00:02:53.379
there was no indication that there was anything at all on the beach.

00:02:53.719 --> 00:03:00.249
What's your point? Dramatic reveal is one thing, but teleporting Skeleton heads would be enough to put most people back on the boat

00:03:04.010 --> 00:03:06.039
Kubo and the Two Strings:

00:03:06.439 --> 00:03:07.519
a contender at the

00:03:07.519 --> 00:03:14.289
2017 Academy Awards, Kubo and the Two Strings dazzled audiences and critics alike with its complex story and characters.

00:03:14.360 --> 00:03:16.840
But animation is very much a tricky endeavor.

00:03:17.200 --> 00:03:18.700
Especially when it comes to digital

00:03:18.709 --> 00:03:25.688
Stop-Motion animation in one instance in the film, Kubo is told to follow the setting sun in order to find the fabled helmet

00:03:25.689 --> 00:03:26.680
He needs recover.

00:03:26.680 --> 00:03:31.000
There's only one problem: Kubo ends up walking towards the rising sun. The

00:03:31.220 --> 00:03:36.309
orientation of the shadows and the sun indicates that the animators may have had a momentary lapse in orientation

00:03:36.500 --> 00:03:39.840
But thankfully it didn't stop Kubo from completing his quest.

00:03:40.880 --> 00:03:42.379
Pocahontas

00:03:42.379 --> 00:03:48.279
Sometimes, animations end up doing the strangest things quite often breaking the rules of logic and physics

00:03:48.409 --> 00:03:53.619
That's exactly what happens in Disney's Pocahontas. In the film, Pocahontas and her friend

00:03:53.620 --> 00:03:59.229
Nakoma, can be seen approaching the tent holding each other's hands, yet under the moonlight a different

00:03:59.229 --> 00:04:06.389
Tale is being told as the two friends shadows are not holding hands. Is this the real story we're supposed to be looking at?

00:04:06.389 --> 00:04:07.890
"Please, don't say anything."

00:04:07.890 --> 00:04:14.660
Tiny details like this may not seem obvious during the animation process, but once it's out there, the tiniest details always seem

00:04:14.660 --> 00:04:16.660
So large, don't they?

00:04:20.910 --> 00:04:22.200
Finding Nemo

00:04:22.200 --> 00:04:28.429
Marlin thankfully found Nemo in the film, but did you find this animation mistake towards the film's Climax?

00:04:28.710 --> 00:04:32.720
Nemo finally gets into the dentist office with the help of the pelican nigel

00:04:32.820 --> 00:04:37.040
However the dentist is not exactly happy to find a large bird in his place of work

00:04:37.350 --> 00:04:43.129
Quickly trucking nigel out yet on the wall near the window of poster magically disappears and reappears

00:04:43.590 --> 00:04:44.610
between shots

00:04:44.610 --> 00:04:50.900
your attention may be focused on the bird and the action but one glance to the right and it becomes impossible not to see the

00:04:50.900 --> 00:04:54.650
poster between shots "you should expect an increase in body hair

00:04:54.750 --> 00:04:57.950
especially on your face, chest, armpit

00:04:57.950 --> 00:05:05.299
And..." " Thank you thats enough." Big Hero 6, one of the most memorable things from Big Hero 6 is the character Baymax

00:05:05.900 --> 00:05:09.500
"hairy, baby"

00:05:10.340 --> 00:05:13.760
But there may be another memorable moment stashed away in your memory

00:05:13.940 --> 00:05:16.300
Banks that we're about to drag back into the light.

00:05:16.540 --> 00:05:24.100
In the film Hero is confronted by professor callaghan pretty early on Who asks the feature Road adventure "may I?"

00:05:24.420 --> 00:05:31.480
"Sure." yet between shots professor callaghan shirts somehow goes from blue to red and then back the blue

00:05:31.480 --> 00:05:35.280
It's a quick moment, but as soon as you see it. You can't unsee it

00:05:36.100 --> 00:05:38.100
*Lions growl*

00:05:38.300 --> 00:05:42.840
The Lion King. The Lion King broke all of our hearts when it came out in

00:05:42.940 --> 00:05:50.480
1993 and has continued to do so over the decades, but in an era before digital animation the animators had to painstakingly

00:05:51.030 --> 00:05:57.950
Animate by hand it's amazing that the attention to detail is at the level that it is but of course mistakes can still happen

00:05:59.760 --> 00:06:07.309
In the film the Hyena Shenzi ends up being slashed in the face by simple leaving deep triple lines cuts across her face

00:06:07.560 --> 00:06:13.280
Yet moments later in the movie her wounds are completely gone and not even a scar has been left behind

00:06:13.920 --> 00:06:15.390
"What did you say ?"

00:06:15.390 --> 00:06:17.390
"Nothing."

00:06:17.390 --> 00:06:19.390
"I got him! I got him!"

00:06:20.960 --> 00:06:23.880
Despicable me. In the opening scene of the movie

00:06:23.940 --> 00:06:29.620
Despicable me a young boy can be seen running past a barricade with a toy plane in his left hand

00:06:29.760 --> 00:06:33.469
the Stubborn boy proceeds to then fall off of a wooden piece of scaffolding

00:06:33.600 --> 00:06:37.339
And into the fake pyramid which Springs the boy back up to safety

00:06:37.470 --> 00:06:45.440
However during this strange turn of events the boy somehow had time to put the plane into his right hand despite being extremely squished inside

00:06:45.440 --> 00:06:47.440
that fake pyramid

00:06:53.100 --> 00:06:58.279
Monsters Inc. Now what could possibly be scarier than monsters in the closet and under your bed?

00:06:58.840 --> 00:07:00.840
*Screams and yells*

00:07:00.960 --> 00:07:08.419
Well forgetting where you stashed your evidence due to an animation mistake of course in the film the child known as boo makes her way

00:07:08.419 --> 00:07:10.489
into the Monster World Which uterly

00:07:10.710 --> 00:07:13.250
Terrified sully in his fit of fear

00:07:13.250 --> 00:07:17.660
He tries to flush boos belongings down the toilet after they stuck to the giant blue monster

00:07:17.760 --> 00:07:24.619
The toilet begins to back up and sully decides to stash the evidence in Locker 193, but during the next shot

00:07:24.620 --> 00:07:29.630
It seems sully actually put everything in locker 190. Dammit sully, pay attention

00:07:29.630 --> 00:07:33.619
This is how problems are made. "Well isn't that nice?"

00:07:34.160 --> 00:07:41.020
