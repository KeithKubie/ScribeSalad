00:00:04.790 --> 00:00:07.250
Hi I’m Martino Stierli.

00:00:07.250 --> 00:00:08.850
And my name is Vladimir Kulić.

00:00:08.850 --> 00:00:11.500
Welcome to K67 Kiosk.

00:00:11.760 --> 00:00:15.780
It's a highly artful piece of design, which
found its way into the streets to

00:00:15.780 --> 00:00:18.980
be used by everyone on a daily basis.

00:00:18.980 --> 00:00:26.360
Bookshops, ticket stores, bakeries even, red,
yellow, orange, white, blue--sprinkled all

00:00:26.360 --> 00:00:27.510
over the urban environment.

00:00:27.510 --> 00:00:30.600
It was really an important contribution to create

00:00:30.720 --> 00:00:35.400
some kind of a life space for citizens in Yugoslavia.

00:00:43.600 --> 00:00:47.700
The end of World War II, there was
a moment of destruction and trauma

00:00:47.710 --> 00:00:51.750
but then was transformed into a great source

00:00:51.750 --> 00:00:54.900
of energy for the reconstruction of the country.

00:00:56.900 --> 00:01:02.180
Hundreds of thousands of young people
contributed to the construction of new railway lines,

00:01:02.180 --> 00:01:04.760
highways, dams, factories.

00:01:05.640 --> 00:01:09.100
The war really had left deep scars that

00:01:09.120 --> 00:01:13.720
produced an enormous forward-looking
utopian vision of a better world.

00:01:13.720 --> 00:01:16.120
And architecture played a fundamental role.

00:01:37.560 --> 00:01:41.310
Here we are standing by the S2 office tower.

00:01:41.310 --> 00:01:45.610
This building is organized
around a massive central core.

00:01:45.610 --> 00:01:50.820
And then we have very elegantly
cantilevering out the office part of the building.

00:01:50.820 --> 00:01:56.070
This office section is actually
resting on two very, very slender

00:01:56.070 --> 00:02:02.630
columns that really makes this massive building
almost float in the air, pushing the very

00:02:02.640 --> 00:02:05.480
notion of structure to the very limits.

00:02:07.480 --> 00:02:12.440
Originally it was intended as only one of
an entire series of high-rises that were going

00:02:12.440 --> 00:02:16.600
to define an entire new city
neighborhood within Ljubljana.

00:02:18.680 --> 00:02:23.510
The Avala TV Tower sits on the
Mount Avala, outside of Belgrade.

00:02:23.510 --> 00:02:29.310
TV towers around the world are the new
exciting building typology, a symbol

00:02:29.310 --> 00:02:35.730
that Yugoslavia and Belgrade have
emerged into the modern era.

00:02:35.730 --> 00:02:39.560
The tower does kind of resemble a rocket.

00:02:46.560 --> 00:02:52.079
The white mosque is a project by the Bosnian
architect, Zlatko Ugljen, in Visoko, it's a small

00:02:52.079 --> 00:02:54.120
town outside of Sarajevo.

00:02:54.120 --> 00:03:01.440
Visoko had been using a 16th-century Ottoman
mosque, a very traditional building that burned down.

00:03:01.760 --> 00:03:09.040
And then the Yugoslav state basically mandated
the reconstruction of a new mosque with modern

00:03:09.049 --> 00:03:13.269
architecture, which led to a lot of resistance
because people were used to their ways and

00:03:13.269 --> 00:03:15.180
wanted to have their old building back.

00:03:15.180 --> 00:03:18.549
So it took a lot of convincing
on part of the architect.

00:03:18.549 --> 00:03:24.500
The roof sort of takes up the pyramidal
form of the traditional mosque in the Balkans.

00:03:24.500 --> 00:03:30.659
But then what he does, he punctuates it with
a series of five skylights that lets the sun

00:03:30.659 --> 00:03:34.049
penetrate into the interior of the building.

00:03:34.049 --> 00:03:41.019
The sun sort of moves over a very sparsely
furnished interior, where light becomes almost

00:03:41.019 --> 00:03:43.640
a building material on its own right.

00:03:45.720 --> 00:03:52.800
Stadia are not always the most elegant buildings.

00:03:52.819 --> 00:03:55.589
Not the case in Split.

00:03:55.600 --> 00:04:00.960
The Poljud Stadium is probably one of the
most beautiful stadia anywhere built in the world.

00:04:01.240 --> 00:04:07.800
The entire structure survives, thanks to a
system of three steel cables that run around

00:04:07.809 --> 00:04:14.969
the perimeter as if it were a giant belt that
holds the entire stadium together, preventing

00:04:14.969 --> 00:04:18.750
it from falling apart.

00:04:18.750 --> 00:04:22.870
It's often compared to a sea shell, which
is appropriate considering its location, that

00:04:22.880 --> 00:04:25.320
it's not really far from the sea.

00:04:26.320 --> 00:04:35.200
How does this visionary thinking behind
modernization, this utopian vision, actually arrive in the

00:04:35.200 --> 00:04:37.880
everyday life of the citizens living in this country?

00:04:37.880 --> 00:04:42.080
It was of course through design objects.

00:04:42.480 --> 00:04:48.340
Many people in the West have this notion that
Yugoslavia was this drab horrible place between

00:04:48.340 --> 00:04:55.030
the Iron Curtain. What this gallery here actually
shows is that there was really a very vibrant

00:04:55.030 --> 00:05:00.341
pop culture and a consumer
culture in place in Yugoslavia.

00:05:00.341 --> 00:05:05.530
One of the underlying principles of modern
architecture, especially housing and apartment building

00:05:05.530 --> 00:05:12.410
is that they are trying to be flexible spaces
that are not stuffy but that are open, have

00:05:12.410 --> 00:05:16.840
a lot of light in them, and that allow
for a variety of different users.

00:05:16.840 --> 00:05:21.690
And what you need for that kind of space are
of course light pieces of furniture that can

00:05:21.690 --> 00:05:25.160
be moved around easily and
adopted for different situations.

00:05:25.160 --> 00:05:30.780
So I want to point out the Rex folding chair
which is one of the most successful design

00:05:30.780 --> 00:05:33.080
objects that were ever produced in Yugoslavia.

00:05:33.080 --> 00:05:40.420
It's a very innovative use of plywood.
It is bent and then it has these sort of slits

00:05:40.420 --> 00:05:45.120
that make it even lighter, which of course
was quite a challenge in terms of design and

00:05:45.120 --> 00:05:48.480
production to keep it...to make it stable nonetheless.

00:05:50.200 --> 00:05:55.680
I'm standing in front of another commissioned
work by the Serbian filmmaker Mila Turajlic.

00:05:55.690 --> 00:06:03.630
She uses found footage, from TV films and
TV series as well as feature films that were

00:06:03.640 --> 00:06:05.960
shown in Yugoslavia at the time.

00:06:08.280 --> 00:06:15.360
You see many, many scenes of people moving
into the new apartments that were provided to them.

00:06:15.720 --> 00:06:25.400
So it addresses in a very humoristic and funny
way problems that came about shoddy construction,

00:06:25.430 --> 00:06:28.610
apartments that were too small for large families.

00:06:28.610 --> 00:06:34.020
There was actually a conversation in Yugoslav
society about precisely these problems.

00:06:34.020 --> 00:06:41.720
But it's also, of course, what shall we say,
the freedoms that these new spaces such as

00:06:41.720 --> 00:06:44.320
here, an elevator afforded to the citizen.

00:06:44.320 --> 00:06:50.540
So you can use the elevator as a place for
a private get together and just press the

00:06:50.540 --> 00:06:53.960
up and down button until you're tired of it.

00:06:56.640 --> 00:07:00.920
You might actually wonder how this
piece came into the Museum

00:07:00.920 --> 00:07:04.520
and in fact, into MoMA's permanent collection.

00:07:04.520 --> 00:07:06.800
Not only did we...

00:07:11.520 --> 00:07:12.640
Okay.

00:07:14.960 --> 00:07:21.080
We have a guestbook here for visitors of the
exhibition to leave their comments and notes.

00:07:21.080 --> 00:07:26.480
"I think that this kind of architecture has
a unique identity. Preserve it."

00:07:26.840 --> 00:07:30.040
There's, like, hearts here and smileys.

00:07:30.060 --> 00:07:31.870
"Complete lack of human scale."

00:07:31.870 --> 00:07:33.930
Oh, you didn't pay much attention.

00:07:33.930 --> 00:07:39.970
A visitor from Finland who says, "Everything
in this exhibition was," capital letters

00:07:39.970 --> 00:07:42.360
"totally new to me. Awesome."
