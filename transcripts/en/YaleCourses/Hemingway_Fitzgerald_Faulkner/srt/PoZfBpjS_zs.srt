1
00:00:02,470 --> 00:00:07,230
Okay. So, um, just want to
go back very briefly, um,

2
00:00:07,260 --> 00:00:11,340
to, um, uh, approach to
as I lay dying last time,

3
00:00:11,341 --> 00:00:15,870
we talk about the importance
of the epic tradition, uh,

4
00:00:15,930 --> 00:00:19,770
to the modern, this novel,
uh, and the way that,

5
00:00:19,830 --> 00:00:23,610
especially the way that
the voice dead and I'm the,

6
00:00:23,910 --> 00:00:28,140
and suddenly the boundaries between
the human and the nonhuman are being

7
00:00:28,230 --> 00:00:32,520
reactivated and redeployed
in as I lay dying.

8
00:00:32,850 --> 00:00:37,650
Uh, so today we're going to move on to
a somewhat different approach to this is

9
00:00:37,651 --> 00:00:42,030
really a different way to
contextualize, uh, as I lay dying.

10
00:00:42,510 --> 00:00:46,760
And, uh, it's more of a kind of
an American, uh, tradition, uh,

11
00:00:46,860 --> 00:00:51,540
for this novel. And in fact, we
really began to see a law that, um,

12
00:00:51,660 --> 00:00:56,560
in the person, uh, who, um, is
in one sense a key player. Uh,

13
00:00:56,700 --> 00:00:58,330
but in another sense, not, um,

14
00:00:58,500 --> 00:01:03,500
the eddies partner in the
adulterous affair and,

15
00:01:03,870 --> 00:01:05,910
uh, Faulkner, uh,

16
00:01:05,940 --> 00:01:10,530
text the name of that person from a
historic figure that's very well known.

17
00:01:10,530 --> 00:01:14,130
Preacher 18th century
preacher George Whitfield,

18
00:01:14,640 --> 00:01:18,450
someone who actually has a very large
presence and Benjamin Franklin's

19
00:01:18,840 --> 00:01:23,780
autobiography. So this is the
very dignified looking, uh,

20
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:26,130
historical George with Phil.

21
00:01:26,550 --> 00:01:30,860
And this is farmers with Phil.
Uh,

22
00:01:31,170 --> 00:01:35,640
when he was on his horse, he was able
to cross the river as we know, uh,

23
00:01:35,700 --> 00:01:40,140
and he's on his way. In fact, he's
approaching his right at the house.

24
00:01:40,740 --> 00:01:45,210
So, um, with feel, um, has a lot of,

25
00:01:45,840 --> 00:01:47,610
has lots to be thankful for.

26
00:01:47,790 --> 00:01:51,530
And his expressing his
gratitude to God at this moment.

27
00:01:53,040 --> 00:01:58,040
It was here in his infinite wisdom that
restrained the tail from her dying lives

28
00:02:00,990 --> 00:02:05,990
as she lays around by those
who loved and trusted her mind.

29
00:02:06,960 --> 00:02:08,550
The travail by water,

30
00:02:09,300 --> 00:02:14,300
which I sustained by the strength of his
hand praise to the indiebound bandages

31
00:02:15,300 --> 00:02:19,860
and omnipotent love. Oh, praise. Um,

32
00:02:19,890 --> 00:02:24,110
yes. I mean he truly is a
very lucky guy. Um, you know,

33
00:02:24,120 --> 00:02:27,270
issue dies before she was able to give
away his name and maybe she never,

34
00:02:27,271 --> 00:02:32,100
plans are just too proud and was
the one to give away his name. Um,

35
00:02:32,130 --> 00:02:35,330
so he's lucky and having chosen
the right partner, someone who,

36
00:02:35,380 --> 00:02:39,480
who lives a seal when it
comes to his name. Um,

37
00:02:39,540 --> 00:02:44,450
and he's also very lucky in the sense
that his horse is such a good swimmer of

38
00:02:44,670 --> 00:02:49,380
that, um, is the horse, is able to
cross the river when the muse drown.

39
00:02:49,830 --> 00:02:54,060
So, um, this is truly, um, you know,
he is truly a blessing figure it,

40
00:02:54,061 --> 00:02:59,061
but of course I'm making fun of him as
I indeed I think Faulkner ones as to,

41
00:03:01,540 --> 00:03:05,930
um, the only way I think to
take someone like with you, um,

42
00:03:06,010 --> 00:03:08,080
is to put him in one particular genre.

43
00:03:08,081 --> 00:03:13,081
And this is really what I liked to argue
today is the question of Java for as I

44
00:03:14,561 --> 00:03:15,394
lay dying,

45
00:03:15,730 --> 00:03:20,730
the only way to take with failed is
to put them in the genres of comedy.

46
00:03:22,060 --> 00:03:26,530
And he's just a common figure. You
know, he's totally serious himself.

47
00:03:26,610 --> 00:03:29,620
This congratulating himself
in his praising the Lord,

48
00:03:30,240 --> 00:03:32,020
but all the time when he's doing that,

49
00:03:32,410 --> 00:03:36,430
he's firmly and Scottish
in the comic tradition.

50
00:03:37,150 --> 00:03:40,050
Um, and it turns out that this, um,

51
00:03:40,600 --> 00:03:45,460
self congratulating self dignifying,
uh,

52
00:03:45,490 --> 00:03:49,220
kind of person actually has a
president in American literature,

53
00:03:49,390 --> 00:03:52,750
a very prominent president.
And it turns out there,

54
00:03:52,770 --> 00:03:57,770
this predecessor is also a minister
who has an affair with a woman.

55
00:04:00,221 --> 00:04:04,720
So we, you know, there's only one
novel, um, in American literature that,

56
00:04:04,990 --> 00:04:05,680
um,

57
00:04:05,680 --> 00:04:10,210
that is like that and not surprisingly
is a novel that we all recognize the

58
00:04:10,211 --> 00:04:14,440
scarlet letter. Um, so
this is Hawthorne's, um,

59
00:04:14,500 --> 00:04:16,490
comic figure.
Um,

60
00:04:16,770 --> 00:04:21,640
skyline is not really usually
read as a comic novel,

61
00:04:21,760 --> 00:04:26,320
but I do think that half of this having
fun when he's portraying other dems down,

62
00:04:26,800 --> 00:04:31,270
God knows and he's merciful.
He have proof his mercy.

63
00:04:31,271 --> 00:04:36,271
Most of all in my afflictions by giving
me this burning towards you or to bear

64
00:04:36,461 --> 00:04:41,020
upon my breasts, praise be his
name, his will be done. Fair. Well,

65
00:04:41,620 --> 00:04:42,340
same.

66
00:04:42,340 --> 00:04:47,340
Exactly the same combination of woman
whose lips are sealed with never give away

67
00:04:48,580 --> 00:04:50,980
the name of her partner.
Um,

68
00:04:51,040 --> 00:04:55,600
and the same kind of mercy from
mercy in cohesion, miles from God.

69
00:04:55,900 --> 00:04:59,470
Um, in this, in this case, um,
other than his name was lucky.

70
00:04:59,471 --> 00:05:02,880
Not in the sense that he has a
horse or who's a good swimmer,

71
00:05:03,550 --> 00:05:08,020
but in the sense that he dies
right at that moment. Um,

72
00:05:08,080 --> 00:05:09,160
and so,
you know,

73
00:05:09,190 --> 00:05:14,190
without in at the very moment when he's
thanking God and he is forgiven his

74
00:05:14,741 --> 00:05:19,420
sense of a given, he dies. So he,
um, is very lucky in that way.

75
00:05:19,840 --> 00:05:22,450
Um, and it, um,

76
00:05:23,140 --> 00:05:27,430
suggest that from the very beginning,
from the 19th century on,

77
00:05:28,020 --> 00:05:31,840
um, a story that otherwise
would have been taken as tragic.

78
00:05:32,230 --> 00:05:36,700
Ashley has the comic dimension to it.
Um,

79
00:05:36,760 --> 00:05:41,760
it's just not very easy to roll our eyes
when we listen to someone like with the

80
00:05:44,321 --> 00:05:48,730
hill and when we listen to someone
like Arthur Dimmesdale. Um,

81
00:05:48,760 --> 00:05:52,570
but even as we were rolling our eyes,
um,

82
00:05:52,660 --> 00:05:57,200
I think that there are other things in
those two novels that is very hard too,

83
00:05:57,201 --> 00:06:02,180
bro. Ally's over. So I want to
turn now to this other dimension,

84
00:06:02,220 --> 00:06:04,820
um, and want to begin
with Hall thought, uh,

85
00:06:04,821 --> 00:06:09,520
by talking about obviously the much
more important tragic dimension, um,

86
00:06:09,620 --> 00:06:14,620
in the scarlet letter and his own has to
print the fact of the symbol or rather

87
00:06:17,210 --> 00:06:22,210
of the position in respect to society
that was indicated by it on the mind of

88
00:06:23,880 --> 00:06:27,710
Hester.
Prynne herself was powerful and peculiar.

89
00:06:28,560 --> 00:06:33,560
All the light and graceful foliage of
her character had been weathered up by

90
00:06:33,981 --> 00:06:37,970
this red hot brand and
had long ago fallen away,

91
00:06:38,420 --> 00:06:41,570
leaving a bear and hush outline,

92
00:06:42,020 --> 00:06:44,090
which might've been repulsive,

93
00:06:44,570 --> 00:06:49,570
has sheet who says friends or
companions to be repelled by it.

94
00:06:50,510 --> 00:06:52,720
So just as um,

95
00:06:53,510 --> 00:06:57,100
Dimsdale and with feel a Aa lucky,
um,

96
00:06:57,230 --> 00:07:00,320
has to print is doubly because,
uh,

97
00:07:00,350 --> 00:07:05,350
she's caused both in the most obvious
way because she has to wear the scarlet

98
00:07:05,901 --> 00:07:10,250
letter for the rest of her
life. Um, and she's also occurs,

99
00:07:10,880 --> 00:07:14,090
well, she's actually AAA cause she
has to wear the scarlet leather.

100
00:07:14,240 --> 00:07:16,040
Her whole being is transformed.

101
00:07:16,041 --> 00:07:21,041
So all the beauty of physical beauty or
the beauty of her mind seemed to have

102
00:07:21,801 --> 00:07:24,110
gone away. Um, and she is just,

103
00:07:24,111 --> 00:07:27,650
it's very hush for building character.
Um,

104
00:07:27,680 --> 00:07:31,940
and that other people might've found
repulsive if she had friends, uh,

105
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:35,810
to be repairable. So, you know,
really she is an absolute,

106
00:07:35,811 --> 00:07:38,380
have not at this point or hold on,

107
00:07:38,510 --> 00:07:42,320
as you guys know who read
the Scott Leather hold on
actually qualifies that this

108
00:07:42,321 --> 00:07:47,120
isn't quite the absolute ending of
the sky. It's quite early. Um, so, um,

109
00:07:47,440 --> 00:07:51,420
this is kind of low point, absolute
low point, the most tragic moment, uh,

110
00:07:51,500 --> 00:07:54,590
for Hester in the sky ladder. And, um,

111
00:07:54,620 --> 00:07:56,630
I want to turn now from,

112
00:07:57,260 --> 00:08:02,260
from Hester to a comparable figure
in a thoughtless as I lay dying.

113
00:08:03,950 --> 00:08:04,370
Um,

114
00:08:04,370 --> 00:08:09,370
and obviously it is adding and she's
especially a tragic in relation to the two

115
00:08:09,591 --> 00:08:14,420
men in her life. First
of all, a relation to,

116
00:08:14,510 --> 00:08:15,380
uh,
with field.

117
00:08:16,190 --> 00:08:20,750
Why waited for him in the woods
waiting for him before he saw me?

118
00:08:21,350 --> 00:08:23,450
I would think of him as dressed in sin,

119
00:08:24,230 --> 00:08:28,490
would think of him as thinking
of me as stressed. Also in sin,

120
00:08:28,940 --> 00:08:29,361
he,

121
00:08:29,361 --> 00:08:34,250
the more beautiful since the Garmin
wish here is changed for sin with send

122
00:08:34,251 --> 00:08:38,390
defied, I would think of
the stand as gum and switch.

123
00:08:38,391 --> 00:08:43,391
We would remove in ologist
shape and colors to terrible
blood to the Phalon echo

124
00:08:46,040 --> 00:08:50,630
of the dead wood high in the air.
It was about as,

125
00:08:51,530 --> 00:08:52,363
um,

126
00:08:52,730 --> 00:08:56,900
joy is the discretion of any condoms,
romance.

127
00:08:57,040 --> 00:09:00,150
It's not even the romance.
It's not adultery. There's no,

128
00:09:00,550 --> 00:09:05,370
there's no sex obviously. And
as I lay dying, um, there's, um,

129
00:09:05,400 --> 00:09:09,680
there's almost no love.
Um, it is just the,

130
00:09:10,240 --> 00:09:15,240
the whole act itself is
causing the terrible blood
to the Phalon echo after dead

131
00:09:17,490 --> 00:09:21,540
air. So it's, um, if,
if that is, you know,

132
00:09:21,541 --> 00:09:24,630
it was hard to understand why anyone
would even want to do that if that is the

133
00:09:24,631 --> 00:09:26,400
nature of the affair.

134
00:09:26,430 --> 00:09:31,430
But that's how falconer would like us to
think of that affair between had a and

135
00:09:33,570 --> 00:09:38,570
a and with you and we can almost to stay
was she would be so Phalon because the,

136
00:09:39,941 --> 00:09:43,890
his, the fact that he's congratulating
himself and scanning himself.

137
00:09:43,920 --> 00:09:48,660
Lucky at the moment of her death suggest
what kind of a lover he has been a,

138
00:09:48,700 --> 00:09:53,700
so maybe it's not surprising that she
should've been salon all the way through.

139
00:09:54,470 --> 00:09:55,110
Um,

140
00:09:55,110 --> 00:10:00,110
and it is also the case that
she's Phalon for another reason.

141
00:10:01,220 --> 00:10:05,970
Um, and maybe that's why she got into
the fair to begin with a relation to her

142
00:10:05,971 --> 00:10:08,370
husband and I would think,

143
00:10:08,610 --> 00:10:12,030
and why and why you answer.

144
00:10:12,510 --> 00:10:17,510
I would think about his name until after
awhile I could see the word as a shape

145
00:10:18,720 --> 00:10:23,430
of vessel. And I would watch
him liquefy and slow into it,

146
00:10:23,490 --> 00:10:28,490
like cold molasses flowing out of the
darkness into the vessel until the jars to

147
00:10:30,511 --> 00:10:35,511
four and motionless significant shape
profoundly without live like an empty

148
00:10:38,040 --> 00:10:39,590
doorframe.
Um,

149
00:10:39,930 --> 00:10:44,930
is the one of the most memorable
descriptions of a terrible marriage,

150
00:10:45,570 --> 00:10:50,150
unbearable marriage. And
um, I think that there's,

151
00:10:50,190 --> 00:10:54,270
that says it all. You know, it
doesn't exactly justify, uh,

152
00:10:54,530 --> 00:10:58,500
eddies action is it needs
justify justification. Um,

153
00:10:58,530 --> 00:11:01,410
but it really explains a lot.
Um,

154
00:11:01,560 --> 00:11:05,640
and it is in contrast to that,

155
00:11:05,641 --> 00:11:10,641
to that coal molasses in the jar that
all of a sudden we see another marriage

156
00:11:11,520 --> 00:11:12,390
and perspective.

157
00:11:12,390 --> 00:11:17,390
So just want to refresh your memory
about what we saw last time about toe and

158
00:11:17,740 --> 00:11:22,320
Cora because it would take a tight
house for coral to hope Cora,

159
00:11:22,560 --> 00:11:24,300
like a job and milk in the spring.

160
00:11:24,630 --> 00:11:27,750
You've got to have the type jar
or you need a powerful spraying.

161
00:11:27,960 --> 00:11:30,030
So if you have a big spring,
why,

162
00:11:30,031 --> 00:11:34,710
then you have the incentive to have tight
wellmade jars because it is your milk

163
00:11:34,920 --> 00:11:35,790
sal or not,

164
00:11:35,791 --> 00:11:39,540
because you would rather have them know
that we're sour then to have that won't

165
00:11:39,541 --> 00:11:43,740
because you are a man. Um, so you
know, it's not as spectacular.

166
00:11:43,741 --> 00:11:48,360
Marriage was good marriage. Um, and
it's, um, a marriage that makes,

167
00:11:48,910 --> 00:11:53,250
how have you like a man and
public core? Like a woman? Um,

168
00:11:53,440 --> 00:11:57,540
I don't mean to be sexist.
Um, just, just the, um,

169
00:11:57,760 --> 00:12:02,110
just the general description
of a good marriage. Um, so, um,

170
00:12:02,630 --> 00:12:07,180
his, um, tell and Cora, um,

171
00:12:07,640 --> 00:12:11,500
as a foil really, uh, to add a and,

172
00:12:11,590 --> 00:12:13,300
and um,

173
00:12:13,330 --> 00:12:18,330
so it seems that right now we've
seen adding mostly as a tragic,

174
00:12:18,930 --> 00:12:23,470
they go right in relation
to her too, man. Um, and uh,

175
00:12:23,530 --> 00:12:25,450
and as a kind of a descendant,

176
00:12:25,451 --> 00:12:29,890
20th century descendant of Hesta Prin.
Um,

177
00:12:30,040 --> 00:12:32,990
but given the residence halls on,

178
00:12:33,010 --> 00:12:37,690
given that that's really a comic
domination, even in the most tragic tale,

179
00:12:37,990 --> 00:12:40,090
we should foot wishing.

180
00:12:40,120 --> 00:12:45,120
Be surprised that they would also be a
comparable comic dimension in SLA die as

181
00:12:47,291 --> 00:12:50,080
well.
So I like to read the whole novel,

182
00:12:50,140 --> 00:12:54,820
as in some sense kind of constant
negotiation between those two poles,

183
00:12:55,000 --> 00:13:00,000
between a comic poke betraying comedy
on the one hand and tragedy, uh,

184
00:13:00,130 --> 00:13:04,270
on the other. And we can see
the Karma that coming in, um,

185
00:13:04,330 --> 00:13:08,090
in at relation to her son,
father man,

186
00:13:08,140 --> 00:13:12,710
who's not quite fully
retarded as Benji is. Um,

187
00:13:12,850 --> 00:13:17,850
the Faulkner is really interested in the
slightly retarded mind sort of farther

188
00:13:17,861 --> 00:13:19,950
than seems to be an instance of that.
Uh,

189
00:13:20,080 --> 00:13:22,680
and it comes on and statements
like my mother's a fish. Um,

190
00:13:22,690 --> 00:13:24,610
I think that along with call me Ishmael,

191
00:13:24,611 --> 00:13:28,060
my mother's is officials got through
one of the most famous lines in American

192
00:13:28,061 --> 00:13:31,440
literature. Um, and so why does,

193
00:13:31,441 --> 00:13:35,570
so this brings us back to the
human and the nonhuman. Um,

194
00:13:35,620 --> 00:13:40,620
but it also now suggest another
dimension and the generic Dinesh and,

195
00:13:41,350 --> 00:13:44,770
um, to, um, add a being a fish.

196
00:13:45,220 --> 00:13:49,360
And it turns out that she's
not just any kind of a fish,

197
00:13:49,930 --> 00:13:52,600
but she's a fish out of water,
which is,

198
00:13:52,601 --> 00:13:57,520
I guess it calmed restatement
of the sense of desolation.

199
00:13:57,550 --> 00:13:59,160
And the philosophy is,
um,

200
00:13:59,320 --> 00:14:02,800
that she feels towards with
you and towards as, I mean,

201
00:14:02,830 --> 00:14:07,360
it's exactly the same thing except it
when we say that she's a fish out of water

202
00:14:07,361 --> 00:14:09,670
is a couple of completely
different style of connotations.

203
00:14:10,090 --> 00:14:15,030
So this is vitamin reporting on this fish.
They,

204
00:14:15,390 --> 00:14:19,750
uh, that he just picked up their fish
already dead, uh, that he's chopping up.

205
00:14:20,590 --> 00:14:22,000
Um,
so,

206
00:14:22,060 --> 00:14:27,060
and you clean it and says he
don't look around farming.

207
00:14:27,680 --> 00:14:31,660
Oh, sorry. Um, this is this
Ashley. Um, this is dow reporting.

208
00:14:31,810 --> 00:14:34,880
You clean it and said he did.
He don't look around father.

209
00:14:34,881 --> 00:14:39,010
When comes back and picks up the fish,
it's lies out of his hands,

210
00:14:39,190 --> 00:14:44,050
smearing wet dirt onto him
and flops down doing itself.

211
00:14:44,380 --> 00:14:48,130
Get Mouth Garbo,
hide hiding into a dust.

212
00:14:48,550 --> 00:14:53,550
Like it was ashamed of being dead like
it was in a hurry to get that again.

213
00:14:55,310 --> 00:14:55,820
Um,

214
00:14:55,820 --> 00:15:00,820
so along with the sens that at a is
a misfit is completely alone and by

215
00:15:02,961 --> 00:15:03,794
yourself,

216
00:15:04,430 --> 00:15:09,300
even in a marriage and even
in an adulterous affair, um,

217
00:15:09,350 --> 00:15:13,880
there's this additional element
that she's ashamed of all of it.

218
00:15:13,970 --> 00:15:16,880
And we can see that shame,
um,

219
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:21,830
in her reaction to,
uh, the horse that, uh,

220
00:15:21,860 --> 00:15:26,780
Joe acquires writing, she's proud,
she is proud, was just also crying.

221
00:15:27,250 --> 00:15:30,020
Um, and Dow realizes that, um,

222
00:15:30,050 --> 00:15:33,530
that she's ashamed of her
deceit at that moment. Um,

223
00:15:33,560 --> 00:15:38,500
so there's this terrible shame
that's going to accompany her, uh,

224
00:15:40,170 --> 00:15:41,620
in her death.
Um,

225
00:15:41,750 --> 00:15:46,750
and in the fish it comes out as the
fish being ashamed of being dead.

226
00:15:46,870 --> 00:15:50,960
Um, even though there's is like
another condition that we could,

227
00:15:51,170 --> 00:15:52,730
that we could help,
but nonetheless,

228
00:15:52,731 --> 00:15:57,590
this fish seems really ashamed
of this elemental fact. Um,

229
00:15:58,250 --> 00:16:03,220
and in contrast, I think
that actually just to, um,

230
00:16:03,590 --> 00:16:08,330
stop for a moment, um, the fish actually
would be a great paper topic, um,

231
00:16:08,370 --> 00:16:12,240
for, for, for your
final paper. Um, and uh,

232
00:16:12,290 --> 00:16:17,290
it would bring Hemingway and thought no
together in a really interesting way.

233
00:16:18,060 --> 00:16:19,190
Um,
so once again,

234
00:16:19,490 --> 00:16:24,320
one of reemphasize how interesting
it might be to pick something that is

235
00:16:24,321 --> 00:16:26,320
progress, a rope, you
know, now the key player,

236
00:16:26,610 --> 00:16:30,110
but they're interesting entry
point into novels. So, um,

237
00:16:30,170 --> 00:16:32,360
in thinking along those lines,
um,

238
00:16:32,420 --> 00:16:37,080
we can go back to the
fish in, in our time. Um,

239
00:16:37,160 --> 00:16:40,460
and it's dead fish too,
that fish. Um, but um,

240
00:16:40,490 --> 00:16:45,470
but totally different set of connotations
that Hemingway, uh, brings to the debt.

241
00:16:45,530 --> 00:16:48,710
Trout.
Nick cleaned them,

242
00:16:48,800 --> 00:16:52,730
sledding them from the
vent to the tip of the jaw.

243
00:16:53,480 --> 00:16:58,400
All the insides and the Gills
and tongue came out in one piece.

244
00:16:58,850 --> 00:17:01,610
They were both males,
long gray,

245
00:17:01,611 --> 00:17:04,700
white strips of no smooth and clean.

246
00:17:05,180 --> 00:17:09,770
All the insides clean and
Compaq coming out all together.

247
00:17:10,400 --> 00:17:14,950
So this is Hemingway's. I
do have a good death. Um,

248
00:17:15,320 --> 00:17:19,310
is the depth of human
beings being actually, uh,

249
00:17:19,370 --> 00:17:24,370
prefigure or maybe encoded
into this very clean,

250
00:17:24,591 --> 00:17:29,540
very dignify death of the fish.
There's no way we can avoid dying.

251
00:17:29,960 --> 00:17:30,350
Um,

252
00:17:30,350 --> 00:17:35,350
but the least that we can ask for is
that we should die in a manner that is

253
00:17:36,470 --> 00:17:38,780
fitting for us. Um, uh,

254
00:17:39,080 --> 00:17:43,340
man of them that is commensurate
with the way that with live, um,

255
00:17:43,370 --> 00:17:47,510
and the child has lived a very clean life,

256
00:17:47,540 --> 00:17:51,540
is important where to Hemingway has
lived with very clean live in the water.

257
00:17:51,840 --> 00:17:56,310
So it is fitting that the death
should be commensurate with that. Um,

258
00:17:56,370 --> 00:18:00,210
and that is really a kind
of utopian moment, um,

259
00:18:00,270 --> 00:18:03,120
in Hemingway and in contrast,

260
00:18:03,420 --> 00:18:05,850
this dirt is fish out of water.

261
00:18:05,880 --> 00:18:10,790
Being ashamed and being
ashamed into unto death, um,

262
00:18:10,870 --> 00:18:13,820
is the dystopian moment in thougth nerve,

263
00:18:14,250 --> 00:18:16,560
but it's also a comic moment as well.

264
00:18:16,561 --> 00:18:21,450
So all I wish to say they're comedies
is obviously very complicated and packed

265
00:18:21,480 --> 00:18:25,920
and you know, in many ways contradictory
phenomenon, um, in Faulkner.

266
00:18:26,430 --> 00:18:30,900
Um, but I want, and it's with
that understanding, you know,

267
00:18:30,930 --> 00:18:35,550
accommodating quotation lost in many
ways that I like to think about the whole

268
00:18:35,551 --> 00:18:38,890
structure of as I lay dying,
um,

269
00:18:39,010 --> 00:18:42,780
as a negotiation to
train comedy and tragedy.

270
00:18:43,110 --> 00:18:47,850
And I like to bring up 3 cents of
terms that we've been talking about all

271
00:18:47,851 --> 00:18:52,851
through the semester to see how comedy
and tragedy get mapped onto these terms.

272
00:18:53,650 --> 00:18:58,430
One is the human and nonhuman that
we've been talking about last time. Um,

273
00:18:58,470 --> 00:19:00,900
and then I want to bring
him in way back up.

274
00:19:00,960 --> 00:19:05,960
It turns out that the two categories have
and have not set up by Hemingway will

275
00:19:08,101 --> 00:19:11,940
be key actually in the rest of
the novels that we'll be reading.

276
00:19:12,210 --> 00:19:14,970
So are we using half and have not,
um,

277
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:20,000
as key terms within the as very useful
and the lid they paradigm and uh,

278
00:19:20,960 --> 00:19:22,650
related to those.
Um,

279
00:19:22,680 --> 00:19:26,430
since we've been talking so much about
kinship beginning with the sound of the

280
00:19:26,431 --> 00:19:30,460
fury and also now as I lay dying brothers,
uh,

281
00:19:30,990 --> 00:19:34,020
who is a kid and who is a non kin.

282
00:19:34,290 --> 00:19:39,290
Last time we saw the Jew is in danger
of being labeled non-kin by uh,

283
00:19:40,020 --> 00:19:43,140
his brother Dao and by
his sister who do Dell.

284
00:19:43,230 --> 00:19:47,100
So who is going to be a nom
kin at the end of this novel?

285
00:19:48,330 --> 00:19:53,330
But first let's start out with the most
obvious comic future of as I lay dying,

286
00:19:56,160 --> 00:20:01,160
which is the most conventional
and then happy ending in marriage.

287
00:20:01,830 --> 00:20:05,070
Um, and if you guys haven't
gotten to that point, I apologize,

288
00:20:05,071 --> 00:20:09,660
but there's no way to talk about it as
comedy without talking about the very

289
00:20:09,661 --> 00:20:13,080
last thing that we see as I lay dying.

290
00:20:13,830 --> 00:20:18,830
It is cash and Joel and vitamin and do
it our process kind of handle and proud

291
00:20:20,851 --> 00:20:25,230
too with his teeth and all,
even as he wouldn't look at it.

292
00:20:25,940 --> 00:20:29,440
I mean this is [inaudible] so,
um,

293
00:20:29,550 --> 00:20:34,470
his wife isn't quite in the ground.
Um,

294
00:20:34,530 --> 00:20:37,650
and um, this is a very fast mover. Um,

295
00:20:37,680 --> 00:20:40,420
so he has acquired a new wife,
um,

296
00:20:40,470 --> 00:20:44,880
and other possessions sessions as well
where he, his teeth. Um, and so on.

297
00:20:44,910 --> 00:20:48,610
This is a new future, um, on ends. Um,

298
00:20:48,820 --> 00:20:53,740
so this is the, the, the Susie
cliched ending, um, for comedy,

299
00:20:53,800 --> 00:20:58,800
you've got to have a marriage and family
are very obligingly gives us a marriage

300
00:20:58,811 --> 00:21:01,810
at the end of, as I lay dying. Um,

301
00:21:01,840 --> 00:21:05,530
but we just know he's going
to qualify it in some fashion.

302
00:21:05,800 --> 00:21:09,290
So right before we see,
uh,

303
00:21:09,650 --> 00:21:13,900
ends with his new wife and
his teeth, his new teeth, um,

304
00:21:14,170 --> 00:21:17,590
we see something else and that
is just taking one step back.

305
00:21:18,570 --> 00:21:19,540
Who is the head.

306
00:21:20,530 --> 00:21:24,100
Then we see it wasn't the grip
that made them look different.

307
00:21:24,610 --> 00:21:29,470
It was this phase and jewel says
he's got the teeth. It was a flap.

308
00:21:30,100 --> 00:21:33,640
It made him look a foot taller,
kind of holding his head up,

309
00:21:33,930 --> 00:21:35,500
hand up and proud to,

310
00:21:36,010 --> 00:21:39,700
and then we see her behind
him carrying the other grip,

311
00:21:40,300 --> 00:21:43,480
kind of duck shape woman all dressed up.

312
00:21:44,320 --> 00:21:48,850
And then I see that the grip she was
carrying was one of them that are raffle

313
00:21:48,851 --> 00:21:50,920
phones.
It was a fact,

314
00:21:53,100 --> 00:21:58,100
I'll shut up and pretty as a picture and
every time a new record with come from

315
00:21:58,211 --> 00:22:03,010
the mail order and us setting in the
house and the window listening to it,

316
00:22:03,520 --> 00:22:08,520
I would think what a shame Dow
couldn't be to enjoy it too.

317
00:22:09,820 --> 00:22:14,820
So a lot of information is coming
at us at this and new teeth,

318
00:22:15,700 --> 00:22:19,780
another possession, graffel
phone, grandma farm. Um,

319
00:22:20,200 --> 00:22:25,200
and the new phenomenon of
records coming by mail order.

320
00:22:25,350 --> 00:22:28,670
Um, this is truly the 20th century. Um,

321
00:22:28,750 --> 00:22:33,430
even though they are still
views it. Third, we are firmly
in the 20th century. Um,

322
00:22:34,090 --> 00:22:38,050
and the crucial detail at the end,

323
00:22:38,110 --> 00:22:42,490
the Dow will be there
to enjoy the records.

324
00:22:43,030 --> 00:22:47,470
So, um, we know right there, and
this is very end, this is to 60,

325
00:22:47,530 --> 00:22:50,690
so we know already has had $2,

326
00:22:50,800 --> 00:22:55,490
just repeating what we've
known prior to this moment. Um,

327
00:22:55,690 --> 00:22:59,620
then this would be constituting
of the bumper, that family,

328
00:23:00,570 --> 00:23:05,570
that one person is no longer
can no longer in that family.

329
00:23:07,870 --> 00:23:09,250
So how does this happen?

330
00:23:09,550 --> 00:23:14,550
Is what we need to find out and we have
to go back a few steps to find out how

331
00:23:15,310 --> 00:23:19,690
it is that our guest excluded
from that family circle.

332
00:23:20,620 --> 00:23:21,730
Um,
so,

333
00:23:21,731 --> 00:23:25,540
but just want to give you a couple of
images why the gramophone would be such a

334
00:23:25,541 --> 00:23:30,390
desirable object, just like the
telephone, all this new equipment,

335
00:23:30,640 --> 00:23:34,390
um, just incredibly glamorous
when they first appear. Um,

336
00:23:34,420 --> 00:23:38,990
so Columbia gramophone
and um, and I like to, um,

337
00:23:39,070 --> 00:23:43,210
since we have all this
desirable objects here, um,

338
00:23:43,300 --> 00:23:48,300
is obviously as I lay dying is Faulkner's
version of to have and have not.

339
00:23:51,440 --> 00:23:56,440
And right there we know that ends
has three very prize possessions,

340
00:23:58,370 --> 00:24:02,120
teeth, wive and gramophone. Um,

341
00:24:02,270 --> 00:24:04,190
and it seems that in contrast,

342
00:24:04,730 --> 00:24:08,900
other people have all lost something.
They all have been,

343
00:24:09,430 --> 00:24:14,220
uh, reclassified in some sense as, um,

344
00:24:14,270 --> 00:24:18,500
have nots. So in many ways, this
was not a zero sum game, uh,

345
00:24:18,970 --> 00:24:19,803
in,
uh,

346
00:24:19,820 --> 00:24:24,820
as I lay dying that one person gets a
lot of stuff at the expense of someone

347
00:24:25,881 --> 00:24:27,150
else is a fairy,

348
00:24:27,760 --> 00:24:32,690
a steer and economic model
that there's no view. Again,

349
00:24:32,750 --> 00:24:37,310
in this world someone gained
something, someone loses something. Um,

350
00:24:37,370 --> 00:24:42,370
and the three people who lose something
in the course of ns acquiring.

351
00:24:42,531 --> 00:24:46,610
So much of the history sounds cass,
jewel and out.

352
00:24:47,180 --> 00:24:51,980
Um, so let's just look at cash. Um, and I,

353
00:24:52,500 --> 00:24:53,390
I can,
you know,

354
00:24:53,391 --> 00:24:56,420
this is not really related to
anything that I've been saying so far,

355
00:24:56,421 --> 00:24:59,360
but you know,
there's clearly cash and Geo caches,

356
00:24:59,361 --> 00:25:04,361
the petty cash and jewel is the one
whose value cannot be a wreck by cash.

357
00:25:05,511 --> 00:25:09,410
So fall is really playing with
the economic model in a big way.

358
00:25:09,410 --> 00:25:11,020
So maybe it's not surprising that,
you know,

359
00:25:11,030 --> 00:25:16,030
it would also be a kind of equal on
economic logic that's determining the

360
00:25:16,670 --> 00:25:20,300
narrative logic. And as I
lay dying as well, but um,

361
00:25:20,330 --> 00:25:24,630
cash been named after the petty
cash. Here's one who would, um,

362
00:25:24,770 --> 00:25:29,390
go try and make $3 a
tourism now seeing his, his,

363
00:25:29,391 --> 00:25:33,660
his mother when she dies, not being
with his mother when she dies. Um,

364
00:25:33,770 --> 00:25:35,440
so petty cash,
um,

365
00:25:35,480 --> 00:25:40,480
but even though he is being
is measure by petty cash,

366
00:25:41,930 --> 00:25:44,810
um,
even in spite of the heat doesn't,

367
00:25:44,840 --> 00:25:49,840
can always hold on to what he has low
as what he does have initially starting

368
00:25:52,401 --> 00:25:53,234
out.

369
00:25:53,960 --> 00:25:58,960
His face turned up a second when
he was sliding back into the water,

370
00:25:59,690 --> 00:26:04,690
it was gray with his eyes closed and the
long swipe of mud across his face that

371
00:26:06,291 --> 00:26:09,290
he let go into her to
go over in the water.

372
00:26:09,980 --> 00:26:13,790
He looked just like no bundle of clothes,

373
00:26:14,300 --> 00:26:17,240
kind of washing up and
down against the bank.

374
00:26:17,960 --> 00:26:21,110
He looked like it was laying
there in the water on his face,

375
00:26:21,590 --> 00:26:25,820
rocking up and down low,
looking at something at the bottom.

376
00:26:26,990 --> 00:26:31,740
Uh,
so cash is my mentality nonhuman.

377
00:26:31,760 --> 00:26:36,740
He's lost his humanity. It looks
like a bundle of clothes. Um,

378
00:26:36,830 --> 00:26:39,990
and um, and we can all do that. You know,

379
00:26:40,420 --> 00:26:44,820
if we are floating in the
river, um, unconscious,

380
00:26:44,850 --> 00:26:47,580
we can look like we are
in an intimate matter,

381
00:26:47,850 --> 00:26:52,180
which is what cash is at this moment.
Um,

382
00:26:52,230 --> 00:26:57,230
he could be in aliment Mather like a
Bumbo of old clothes or we can also think

383
00:26:58,651 --> 00:27:03,651
about this in kind of kinship that is
snapping in place because we have Ashley,

384
00:27:04,140 --> 00:27:04,960
um,

385
00:27:04,960 --> 00:27:09,750
fall and make sure that we have vivid
memory of something else that also slow

386
00:27:09,751 --> 00:27:13,890
that before live this in the
water between the two hills.

387
00:27:13,980 --> 00:27:15,990
I see the muse once more,

388
00:27:16,470 --> 00:27:21,470
they row up out of the water in succession
turning completely over the legs,

389
00:27:22,170 --> 00:27:26,400
deflate extended as when they
had lost contact with the glove.

390
00:27:26,790 --> 00:27:31,790
So the reuse of floating belly
up the legs stiffly extended,

391
00:27:32,190 --> 00:27:35,250
um, best to kind of
unnatural postures for them.

392
00:27:35,820 --> 00:27:40,560
And cash is floating face down while he's
looking at something at the bottom of

393
00:27:40,561 --> 00:27:42,810
the river. Um, but either way,

394
00:27:42,990 --> 00:27:47,690
the two pastures are almost
magical in the sense that uh,

395
00:27:47,910 --> 00:27:52,380
both amused and cash are
reduced to inanimate matter,

396
00:27:52,680 --> 00:27:57,210
um, in, in that kind of posture. Um, and,

397
00:27:57,240 --> 00:27:57,780
um,

398
00:27:57,780 --> 00:28:02,780
we know that the muse on
ambulance photo and, um,

399
00:28:02,820 --> 00:28:07,680
they also emblems for
it's not cow is cash. Um,

400
00:28:07,740 --> 00:28:11,540
is, is for, for caches. Um, kinship, uh,

401
00:28:11,940 --> 00:28:16,830
that he too is a creature a
with feet of clay. And so,

402
00:28:16,890 --> 00:28:20,530
um, this is really FMA reaffirming, um,

403
00:28:20,640 --> 00:28:25,260
the fact that he's not capable of lots of
things. It's a very good carpenter, um,

404
00:28:25,290 --> 00:28:25,681
based,

405
00:28:25,681 --> 00:28:30,600
not capable of surviving in hostile
environment and water is one of them.

406
00:28:31,050 --> 00:28:32,670
Um, so, um,

407
00:28:32,730 --> 00:28:36,540
he right there is just that
kinship as being a reaffirm,

408
00:28:36,930 --> 00:28:41,930
but we can also see Tash as an
ironic instance of a half as well.

409
00:28:43,440 --> 00:28:43,710
Um,

410
00:28:43,710 --> 00:28:48,710
and this is something that we actually
come into play in a big way and the last

411
00:28:49,651 --> 00:28:51,750
Hemingway novel,
um,

412
00:28:51,840 --> 00:28:56,020
that in fact it comes into play
in to Hemingway novels. Um,

413
00:28:56,110 --> 00:29:01,110
I promise you that this ironic use
of the hat will be a central moment,

414
00:29:03,240 --> 00:29:07,950
um, in for whom devout hose. But looking
back, so we have that to go forward to.

415
00:29:08,340 --> 00:29:12,540
Uh, but we can also look back to
an earlier moment in half and half,

416
00:29:12,541 --> 00:29:17,220
not when Harry Morgan is
dying. Uh, his unconscious.

417
00:29:17,670 --> 00:29:21,900
Um, and he feels that his, this
rubber hose inside of him. Right.

418
00:29:21,901 --> 00:29:24,470
So when we're talking about that moment,
um,

419
00:29:24,690 --> 00:29:29,460
I was suggesting a, although I
wasn't pushing very hard on that,

420
00:29:29,850 --> 00:29:32,280
um, the, there was a
moment of an ironic have,

421
00:29:32,281 --> 00:29:36,090
we don't actually have rubber
hoses inside our bellies, uh,

422
00:29:36,091 --> 00:29:40,980
but they can sometimes feel that way.
Um, and so it's an ironic procession,

423
00:29:41,110 --> 00:29:45,820
was very negative possession,
ironically vested in us. Um,

424
00:29:45,880 --> 00:29:50,770
and here, um, it's the same
idea in thought leader.

425
00:29:51,160 --> 00:29:54,760
Um,
cat as having an Iran,

426
00:29:54,790 --> 00:29:59,790
they put stash and that is make tones
and into casualty as it did Harry Morgan

427
00:30:00,191 --> 00:30:05,080
in to have and have not
cash has a broken leg.

428
00:30:05,440 --> 00:30:07,750
He has had two broken legs.

429
00:30:07,960 --> 00:30:12,960
He lies on the box with a quilt road on
his head and the peers who were under

430
00:30:13,121 --> 00:30:17,050
his knee, I reckon we ought to
left him at arms dance palaces.

431
00:30:17,380 --> 00:30:22,380
I haven't got a broken leg and par
hasn't and dial hasn't and it's just the

432
00:30:23,951 --> 00:30:27,670
bumps catch says it's kind of
grinds together a little on a bum.

433
00:30:28,450 --> 00:30:31,850
It don't bother them.
So far,

434
00:30:32,100 --> 00:30:34,180
the man is the one who is speaking here.

435
00:30:34,210 --> 00:30:38,770
Vitamin is really rubbing in that has,

436
00:30:38,800 --> 00:30:41,920
has a broken leg.
He has had two in his life.

437
00:30:42,400 --> 00:30:47,400
He's managed to break both of his
legs in his occupation as a carpenter,

438
00:30:48,160 --> 00:30:52,210
fallen down from some hype,
uh, in this case, just, uh,

439
00:30:52,240 --> 00:30:56,410
his leg is broken by a battery by,

440
00:30:56,650 --> 00:31:01,180
by the Horse, um, and,
and the law. Um, so,

441
00:31:01,210 --> 00:31:05,230
um, he, um, has, he does what he has.

442
00:31:05,231 --> 00:31:10,210
He's lost his tools at this point.
He's lost his consciousness. Um,

443
00:31:10,360 --> 00:31:11,620
he's lost his leg.

444
00:31:11,621 --> 00:31:16,000
But what he has instead of a good life
is a broken leg that as well as in his

445
00:31:16,001 --> 00:31:20,920
possession now. So it's definitely,
it's an ironic instance. Um, uh,

446
00:31:21,010 --> 00:31:24,400
have an vitamin is very,
very glad that he doesn't have that.

447
00:31:24,430 --> 00:31:28,270
I don't have that part, doesn't
have that. Dow doesn't have that.

448
00:31:28,300 --> 00:31:32,630
So definitely it is at the verb to have,
um,

449
00:31:32,750 --> 00:31:36,340
as alive though they, um, but we can also,

450
00:31:36,341 --> 00:31:39,850
so that is an instance of
Errand Ising that thought,

451
00:31:40,090 --> 00:31:45,090
but this also kind of a straightforward
instance of cash as a have not in a very

452
00:31:45,821 --> 00:31:49,570
simple quantifiable way.
Um,

453
00:31:49,600 --> 00:31:53,980
and actually quantification
is kind of interesting, um,
in thoughts on it as well.

454
00:31:53,981 --> 00:31:55,600
If we think of the entire novel,

455
00:31:55,780 --> 00:32:00,550
the whole narrative economy is kind of
zero sum game than actually quantifying

456
00:32:00,551 --> 00:32:05,140
who gets what and measuring that against
who loses what actually this kind of

457
00:32:05,170 --> 00:32:09,370
quantify logic going on in,
uh, it's already done. Um,

458
00:32:09,490 --> 00:32:14,290
so this is of quantifying
moment. Um, and as I lay dying,

459
00:32:14,530 --> 00:32:16,750
we know that the muse have drum,

460
00:32:17,170 --> 00:32:21,580
so they have to get another team of news.
This is very few poor people,

461
00:32:22,000 --> 00:32:26,410
that team of Muse with
cause flooding hours.

462
00:32:26,900 --> 00:32:27,370
Um,

463
00:32:27,370 --> 00:32:32,370
and it seems that ans actually has
managed to come up with the $40.

464
00:32:33,910 --> 00:32:38,910
So Dow is trying to figure it
out where he got the $40 from.

465
00:32:40,100 --> 00:32:41,840
So that's what you were doing.

466
00:32:42,350 --> 00:32:47,350
And caches closed last night
down that cash aim to buy that.

467
00:32:47,591 --> 00:32:52,591
Talking machine from Surat with that
money does that and stood there,

468
00:32:53,090 --> 00:32:57,560
mumbling his mouth to watch him
be anything. Never blinked yet,

469
00:32:58,100 --> 00:33:02,450
but that's just $8 more.
Does that and that voice,

470
00:33:02,451 --> 00:33:05,810
like it was just listening and
never give him doing it himself.

471
00:33:06,170 --> 00:33:11,170
That's the one by team as to look that
you quick kind of sliding his eyes that

472
00:33:12,471 --> 00:33:16,730
way that he looked down again.
God knows if there was ever a man,

473
00:33:16,731 --> 00:33:18,890
it says still,
they didn't say nothing.

474
00:33:19,160 --> 00:33:23,150
They just watch him waiting and
him sliding his eyes to what?

475
00:33:23,151 --> 00:33:27,890
The feed and out the legs.
But no, Ohio and the homeless,

476
00:33:28,820 --> 00:33:29,653
he says,

477
00:33:30,410 --> 00:33:35,410
so we know exactly what it takes to reach
that fully dollar mach is to get $10

478
00:33:40,041 --> 00:33:44,360
from do doubt.
There's no time to talk about that.

479
00:33:44,390 --> 00:33:47,160
It's just straightforward.
She was $10, um,

480
00:33:47,200 --> 00:33:51,470
for the left to fill your abortion
and he got the $10 from her.

481
00:33:51,770 --> 00:33:53,750
Um,
and um,

482
00:33:53,900 --> 00:33:58,900
he gets $8 from a cash it gas was
going to use that to buy a telephone.

483
00:34:00,470 --> 00:34:04,960
Um,
that's very far from that goal.

484
00:34:04,990 --> 00:34:05,900
$40.

485
00:34:06,140 --> 00:34:11,140
So one very valuable thing has to be
traded in order to him to get to $40.

486
00:34:13,760 --> 00:34:18,760
And there's just one thing left is the
most obvious item that is in anyone's

487
00:34:19,551 --> 00:34:24,200
possession. Um, so we can
turn now to, you know, uh,

488
00:34:24,230 --> 00:34:28,460
Jews, horse obviously is
key from beginning to end.

489
00:34:29,080 --> 00:34:30,170
Um,
but I just,

490
00:34:30,171 --> 00:34:34,190
since we've been talking about
kinship between humans and animals,

491
00:34:34,580 --> 00:34:38,870
I just want to stop very briefly and,
and once again,

492
00:34:38,900 --> 00:34:43,900
hold on the conjecture but I think that
was [inaudible] is in here is in some

493
00:34:44,571 --> 00:34:48,050
ways taking this back to the moment when,
um,

494
00:34:48,440 --> 00:34:50,960
is both a horse and the snake,
right?

495
00:34:50,990 --> 00:34:55,250
You talked about that last time
that he's caught between two posts.

496
00:34:55,580 --> 00:35:00,580
His both a horse bill also does
something snake like about his movement.

497
00:35:01,740 --> 00:35:02,450
Um,

498
00:35:02,450 --> 00:35:07,450
and it seems that that association with
the snake has been reinvested in ads.

499
00:35:10,400 --> 00:35:14,690
So we have the image of him
repeated twice as lightning,

500
00:35:14,691 --> 00:35:15,840
his eyes to Sgo,

501
00:35:15,950 --> 00:35:20,060
sliding his eyes to a
defeat and up the legs,

502
00:35:20,480 --> 00:35:21,790
but no higher.

503
00:35:21,810 --> 00:35:26,810
It is not sliding motion that realize
the human nonhuman configuration in as I

504
00:35:28,821 --> 00:35:31,190
lay dying.
So that it is,

505
00:35:31,250 --> 00:35:35,210
and who is the snake in the family.
Um,

506
00:35:35,270 --> 00:35:40,270
and it's as a jewel has suddenly been
free from his kinship with the snake.

507
00:35:42,331 --> 00:35:45,690
Cause someone else, maybe there's
just, this is also a zero sum game.

508
00:35:45,900 --> 00:35:50,900
There's only one person in a family
who could claim kinship with the snake.

509
00:35:52,290 --> 00:35:56,820
And as right here is claiming
kinship with the snake.

510
00:35:57,090 --> 00:36:01,150
So Joe is going to relinquish
his friend, his kingship, um,

511
00:36:01,350 --> 00:36:05,300
and be redefined in a
different way. So, um, but the,

512
00:36:05,301 --> 00:36:09,540
just to wrap up with cash is lost $8.
Once again,

513
00:36:09,750 --> 00:36:13,750
true to his name. That's what he
loses. Still a very [inaudible].

514
00:36:14,790 --> 00:36:17,740
Uh, but this is the big loser. Um,

515
00:36:18,290 --> 00:36:22,350
and he has that margin is per
session so he can afford to lose big.

516
00:36:23,130 --> 00:36:23,700
Um,

517
00:36:23,700 --> 00:36:28,700
but let's start out with an image of
Geo as still a half still having that

518
00:36:30,331 --> 00:36:32,730
thing. Uh, when, um,

519
00:36:33,750 --> 00:36:38,130
it's clear that when it, the emergent
situation is becoming clear to everyone.

520
00:36:38,720 --> 00:36:41,640
Um,
it is jewel that as is looking at,

521
00:36:41,641 --> 00:36:45,870
and Joe has not reacted in any fashion.
So this is a true,

522
00:36:46,200 --> 00:36:46,890
um,

523
00:36:46,890 --> 00:36:51,890
turning point where things
or have a moment of critical
moment when things could

524
00:36:51,921 --> 00:36:56,310
have gone either way. Right? So the
horse is still in Jews possession.

525
00:36:56,750 --> 00:36:59,880
Um, he doesn't have to
give up. The horse is,

526
00:36:59,910 --> 00:37:04,910
would be impossible for as to take control
of the horse is the last person to be

527
00:37:04,921 --> 00:37:09,490
able to control that wild horse. Only
one person can control that whole list.

528
00:37:09,530 --> 00:37:12,120
Joe.
So this is a critical moment.

529
00:37:12,270 --> 00:37:16,890
How is as going to be able to get a
hold of the host to sell the horse?

530
00:37:17,430 --> 00:37:18,060
Um,

531
00:37:18,060 --> 00:37:23,060
and it seems as if Julie has
really tended in one direction,

532
00:37:23,690 --> 00:37:26,700
this is a route that he could have taken,

533
00:37:27,110 --> 00:37:30,210
but I'm giving it away in the sense
that no, is the road not taken,

534
00:37:30,390 --> 00:37:34,500
but this is the one when we looked like
this was row that he's about to take a,

535
00:37:34,501 --> 00:37:36,780
so as soon as Joe here is
that, you know, it was,

536
00:37:36,781 --> 00:37:41,580
the horse is part of the Bhag and um,
then it's spit slow and said hell,

537
00:37:41,790 --> 00:37:46,380
he turned and went onto the gate
and on the, the Horse in God on it,

538
00:37:47,010 --> 00:37:48,360
they went outside that way.

539
00:37:48,361 --> 00:37:53,361
The two of them looking like some kind
of spot is cycling still true to that

540
00:37:53,371 --> 00:37:58,371
original image of
incredibly fast movement,

541
00:37:58,530 --> 00:38:02,100
almost super human in the speed
with which the two of them move.

542
00:38:02,190 --> 00:38:03,540
And also so the human,

543
00:38:03,570 --> 00:38:07,830
almost mythic in a sense that man and
horse and become one does the Hemingway,

544
00:38:08,120 --> 00:38:08,490
um,

545
00:38:08,490 --> 00:38:13,490
image that is transposed onto fallen
since the closest the farmer has worked

546
00:38:13,710 --> 00:38:17,880
ever get to Hemingway is Jew
and the horse becoming one. Um,

547
00:38:17,910 --> 00:38:19,590
so it looks like that,
you know,

548
00:38:20,760 --> 00:38:23,220
answers never gonna be able to get $40,

549
00:38:23,221 --> 00:38:26,680
because Joe and hosts had cleared out.
Um,

550
00:38:26,720 --> 00:38:31,720
do you can still be a have if
this were the ending of Sally die,

551
00:38:34,120 --> 00:38:35,650
this is what happens after that.

552
00:38:37,090 --> 00:38:42,090
The horse I said and answers boy taking
that horse and clean out last night,

553
00:38:44,020 --> 00:38:48,670
probably halfway to Texas by now. And
as, I don't know who Brung it used to,

554
00:38:48,671 --> 00:38:53,320
said I never see them. I just found
the Horse in the barn this morning.

555
00:38:53,970 --> 00:38:55,590
They went to few,
uh,

556
00:38:55,720 --> 00:39:00,250
told Mr snoops he said to
bring the team over here.

557
00:39:00,430 --> 00:39:05,430
So the team of mew arrives because Mr
Snow's did get the whole list and only one

558
00:39:09,160 --> 00:39:13,720
person could have brought
the horse to Snopes. So,

559
00:39:13,810 --> 00:39:17,830
um, jus becomes, I have not,

560
00:39:17,831 --> 00:39:22,420
when we can see why he's losing his
kinship to the snake is becoming,

561
00:39:22,520 --> 00:39:27,520
have not by voluntarily like
relinquishing his possession of the horse.

562
00:39:29,080 --> 00:39:32,890
He is the most tragic
figure. He one says, uh,

563
00:39:32,920 --> 00:39:37,180
because he has the most power to refuse
to live, relinquish that procession.

564
00:39:37,720 --> 00:39:42,720
And he is the one who actually our
office power actually willfully,

565
00:39:43,000 --> 00:39:47,290
deliberately,
consciously gives up that possession.

566
00:39:47,950 --> 00:39:50,230
Um, so, um, it,

567
00:39:51,460 --> 00:39:56,460
the time has come for remapping of
the whole tennis ship structure.

568
00:39:57,060 --> 00:39:58,840
Um,
and as I lay dying,

569
00:39:58,870 --> 00:40:03,850
Gio has up to this point being
been the outsider to the family.

570
00:40:04,120 --> 00:40:09,120
Here's the one that everyone picks out
as being a non-kin by Dow and by do

571
00:40:10,470 --> 00:40:11,400
doubt.
Um,

572
00:40:11,560 --> 00:40:16,560
but this is the moment when all of a
sudden he's been admitted for the first

573
00:40:17,981 --> 00:40:22,981
time into the family circle and was
interesting is that this will join of the

574
00:40:25,751 --> 00:40:30,751
kinship lies is dramatize by Faulkner as
through racialization of both cash and

575
00:40:35,261 --> 00:40:40,240
kill. And we can stay why they are both
racialized at this critical moment.

576
00:40:40,270 --> 00:40:42,640
They become chin because
they both become black.

577
00:40:43,810 --> 00:40:46,780
Kansas leg and foot turned black.

578
00:40:47,230 --> 00:40:51,970
He held the lamb and look at caches
for and like where it was black.

579
00:40:52,580 --> 00:40:55,130
You full, it looks like
a negative. His foot cat,

580
00:40:55,240 --> 00:41:00,220
I said Ju was lying on
his back on his face.

581
00:41:00,370 --> 00:41:03,790
His bag was rare.
Do they'll put the medicine on it.

582
00:41:03,890 --> 00:41:07,390
The Madison was made of butter
and stood to draw the fire.

583
00:41:08,080 --> 00:41:11,260
Then his back was black.
Does it hurt you? I said,

584
00:41:11,620 --> 00:41:15,340
your back looks like a niggers
Joe as that Cassius foot.

585
00:41:15,370 --> 00:41:19,950
And like look like a negatives.
This is really heavy handed a father.

586
00:41:20,650 --> 00:41:23,770
They both look like niggers.
Um,

587
00:41:23,890 --> 00:41:28,840
and for two different
reasons. Um, caches, foot,

588
00:41:29,430 --> 00:41:29,830
um,

589
00:41:29,830 --> 00:41:34,510
is turning black because they
put concrete on it by two

590
00:41:36,050 --> 00:41:40,150
sinks, the leg does this fix
the broken leg, the abundance,

591
00:41:40,151 --> 00:41:42,200
I put concrete on it.
That's the way of,

592
00:41:42,720 --> 00:41:46,610
that's the medical practice
within the bundle and family.

593
00:41:46,880 --> 00:41:51,110
So his foot is turning
black at this moment. Um,

594
00:41:51,200 --> 00:41:53,990
and Jews,
um,

595
00:41:54,380 --> 00:41:59,250
back is whack because he'd
just been in the fire.

596
00:41:59,251 --> 00:42:03,350
He's the one who actually safe the coffin.
Others dubious thing to do.

597
00:42:03,710 --> 00:42:08,660
He's the one who actually saved the coffin
when the bottom was selling fire. Um,

598
00:42:08,720 --> 00:42:09,920
and as a consequence again,

599
00:42:10,160 --> 00:42:15,160
he gets this severe burn on his back
and that's why his back is all black.

600
00:42:15,831 --> 00:42:18,140
So each of them, Ashley, um,

601
00:42:18,200 --> 00:42:22,400
has lost something and they gain
something. They don't have a normal color,

602
00:42:23,010 --> 00:42:26,030
like have a normal color back.
They've gone,

603
00:42:26,031 --> 00:42:29,720
they've gained a black
legging and plan back, um,

604
00:42:29,780 --> 00:42:32,570
and is in as a result of,
you know,

605
00:42:32,571 --> 00:42:37,160
being black and in this manner and all
of a sudden they become brothers. So,

606
00:42:37,250 --> 00:42:41,870
um,
this is a new concept of brotherhood.

607
00:42:42,260 --> 00:42:42,590
Uh,

608
00:42:42,590 --> 00:42:47,330
and new membership been proposed
for that kinship structure.

609
00:42:47,810 --> 00:42:48,660
Uh,
Joe,

610
00:42:48,661 --> 00:42:53,661
who's previously been outside of that
cancer can shift circle has been a minute

611
00:42:55,910 --> 00:43:00,910
and we'll see who is going to be
excluded once again to sales game.

612
00:43:02,120 --> 00:43:05,280
You know, someone has been learning, um,

613
00:43:05,630 --> 00:43:10,370
who is it and for what reason
is he going to be left out?

614
00:43:13,170 --> 00:43:14,880
It wasn't nothing else to do.

615
00:43:15,570 --> 00:43:20,570
It was either send him to Jackson or
have to Massbay sewers because he knows

616
00:43:23,341 --> 00:43:26,400
some way the dowel set fire to it.

617
00:43:26,820 --> 00:43:31,820
So everything is interlocking and father
it is that fire than turns Jews back

618
00:43:37,620 --> 00:43:39,900
into a black back.

619
00:43:40,530 --> 00:43:44,510
And the same fire also has
consequences for other people.

620
00:43:44,560 --> 00:43:49,560
You don't set fire to the bond
without someone paying for it.

621
00:43:49,920 --> 00:43:54,180
And it turns out that it is, uh,
who is going to be here for it.

622
00:43:54,210 --> 00:43:58,650
And the language that is used
here, this is cash. Who's speaking,

623
00:43:59,250 --> 00:44:04,250
I'm still in the voice of someone who's
used to being helpless and used to not

624
00:44:05,971 --> 00:44:10,971
being able to modify the situation that
is given this just nothing else to do.

625
00:44:12,900 --> 00:44:17,900
One person has to take the blame and
to take the consequences of that blame.

626
00:44:19,021 --> 00:44:22,410
So one person has to be sent to Jackson.

627
00:44:22,440 --> 00:44:27,440
And we know what Jackson is in already
has been looming presence and the sound

628
00:44:28,981 --> 00:44:33,180
of the theory as the ultimate for bed Jay.
Um,

629
00:44:33,240 --> 00:44:36,300
and it is actually the home for,

630
00:44:37,050 --> 00:44:40,860
for down much sooner than
it will be for Benji.

631
00:44:41,400 --> 00:44:46,400
So let's look at two instances of the
reconstituted of the narrowing of the

632
00:44:48,601 --> 00:44:51,840
kinship circle and cash,
uh,

633
00:44:51,900 --> 00:44:55,770
talking now and looking
at his brother Dao,

634
00:44:56,220 --> 00:45:00,060
but beginning to see
his brother as a non-kin

635
00:45:01,930 --> 00:45:06,030
when doubt this is kept
speaking. Um, and his actually,

636
00:45:06,031 --> 00:45:10,300
his sort of agrees with Dow that might
maybe is a good thing to burn up the cart.

637
00:45:10,310 --> 00:45:10,731
And you know,

638
00:45:10,731 --> 00:45:15,731
it's just so humiliating for adding to
be smelling and other buses descending on

639
00:45:15,961 --> 00:45:20,670
her. You know, they keep counting 10,
and then more and more. Um, and everyone,

640
00:45:20,700 --> 00:45:23,370
all the towns, they go through, uh,

641
00:45:23,400 --> 00:45:27,810
wanting to sue them because
of the terrible smell that
is coming from the coffin.

642
00:45:28,150 --> 00:45:32,160
Um, so because of this other humiliation
that's been visited upon hourly,

643
00:45:32,430 --> 00:45:34,710
it would have been a good
thing to burn up the coffin.

644
00:45:35,280 --> 00:45:38,130
And because it wasn't going to happen and
nobody else was going to do at Dow was

645
00:45:38,131 --> 00:45:42,870
going to do it. So cash can see the
reason for wanting to burn up the coffin,

646
00:45:42,900 --> 00:45:46,710
but he can also see that maybe is not
such a great thing for the person who was

647
00:45:46,711 --> 00:45:47,544
doing it.

648
00:45:47,820 --> 00:45:51,750
When Dalcin that look like one
of us would have to do something,

649
00:45:52,110 --> 00:45:55,560
I can almost believe
he done right in a way,

650
00:45:56,220 --> 00:45:57,870
but I don't reckon nothing.

651
00:45:57,871 --> 00:46:02,871
Excuses setting fire to man's bond and
endangering his stock and destroying his

652
00:46:04,591 --> 00:46:08,520
property. That's how I reckon
recommend man is crazy.

653
00:46:09,090 --> 00:46:10,980
That's how I can see eye to eye.

654
00:46:11,040 --> 00:46:14,070
That's how he can see eye
to eye with other folks.

655
00:46:14,460 --> 00:46:17,520
And I reckon the end,
nothing else to do with him.

656
00:46:17,520 --> 00:46:22,200
But what the most folks says is right.
So

657
00:46:23,910 --> 00:46:26,550
cash ceiling,

658
00:46:26,580 --> 00:46:30,950
his bond with Dow as Dow,

659
00:46:30,951 --> 00:46:31,784
his brother,

660
00:46:31,950 --> 00:46:36,950
the kids should bond is superseded by a
much more clearcut [inaudible] relation

661
00:46:39,390 --> 00:46:44,390
is you down really has no relation to Joe
sp other than that he is the destroyer

662
00:46:45,630 --> 00:46:47,220
of Gillespies property,

663
00:46:47,760 --> 00:46:52,760
but it is the destroyer of gymnastics
property that he will get sent to Jackson.

664
00:46:54,060 --> 00:46:58,230
Is that impersonal?
Their relationship,

665
00:46:58,290 --> 00:47:03,290
they were defined down in the hand
and not his kinship with his brother.

666
00:47:05,100 --> 00:47:08,910
Two brothers. Um, so
this is the exclusion,

667
00:47:08,940 --> 00:47:13,310
the beginning of the exclusion and
the lodging for that exclusion, uh,

668
00:47:13,960 --> 00:47:16,920
of Dow from their family circle.
Um,

669
00:47:16,950 --> 00:47:21,480
but it is vitamin who puts the
case most strongly and clearly

670
00:47:23,480 --> 00:47:25,920
fallen in talking about
that he went to Jackson,

671
00:47:26,670 --> 00:47:29,040
he went crazy and went to Jackson.

672
00:47:29,080 --> 00:47:34,080
Both lots of people didn't go crazy pie
in cash and Joe and do thou in me then

673
00:47:35,231 --> 00:47:40,020
go crazy. We never did go crazy. We
didn't go through Jackson leader.

674
00:47:42,490 --> 00:47:47,020
This is a child. He's still clueless,
but he's also the most ominous,

675
00:47:47,250 --> 00:47:47,650
um,

676
00:47:47,650 --> 00:47:52,650
that the family from now on is going
to be part and cash and jewel and do it

677
00:47:53,111 --> 00:47:58,060
out.
And me father man is not going to include,

678
00:47:58,630 --> 00:48:03,190
I think work's been radically
reconstitute it. Um,

679
00:48:03,250 --> 00:48:08,250
and it is on the basis of that
reconstitution that we can think about,

680
00:48:08,770 --> 00:48:12,100
uh, as behalf not as the, that have not,

681
00:48:12,130 --> 00:48:16,720
I think Dow and jewelers and metrical
that Science Joe has given up the thing

682
00:48:16,721 --> 00:48:21,721
that is most monitoring
monetarily valuable and he's
given up the thing that is

683
00:48:23,321 --> 00:48:27,670
most humanly valuable.
Dal has gone to Jackson.

684
00:48:27,671 --> 00:48:32,230
This is Dov speaking and then speak
referring to himself in the third person

685
00:48:33,070 --> 00:48:37,270
talking about himself as in the third
person that has gone to Jackson,

686
00:48:37,420 --> 00:48:41,320
they put him on another train
laughing down a long car, current law,

687
00:48:41,380 --> 00:48:44,920
laughing and has turning the
heads of hours when he passed.

688
00:48:45,240 --> 00:48:49,090
What are you laughing at?
I said, yes, yes, yes, yes.

689
00:48:49,510 --> 00:48:52,990
Dow is our brother, our brother Dao. Oh,

690
00:48:52,991 --> 00:48:54,580
brother Zhao in occasion,

691
00:48:54,581 --> 00:48:59,581
Jackson where his grime has blind with
light in the is looking out his phones.

692
00:49:01,000 --> 00:49:04,270
Yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes.

693
00:49:05,350 --> 00:49:07,120
So he's lost his mind.

694
00:49:07,700 --> 00:49:12,700
That's what there is to lose
in the cause of this novel.

695
00:49:14,261 --> 00:49:18,150
He has lost his family. We
know that. That's one of the,

696
00:49:18,850 --> 00:49:19,420
uh,

697
00:49:19,420 --> 00:49:23,980
nonmonetary things that can also be
lost as lost as brothers is lost.

698
00:49:23,981 --> 00:49:27,070
Everything is lost,
his freedom.

699
00:49:27,580 --> 00:49:32,230
And he also has lost his mind.
So we can really think of a darker,

700
00:49:32,260 --> 00:49:34,030
and then this,

701
00:49:34,510 --> 00:49:37,900
and it says a lot about Faulkner,

702
00:49:38,260 --> 00:49:43,260
that this dockers of endings is
Ashley stuck in the middle of a story.

703
00:49:44,051 --> 00:49:48,390
They actually, as a comic, and they, and
that's what fat does. What John does.
