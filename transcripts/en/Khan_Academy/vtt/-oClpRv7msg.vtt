00:00:00.500 --> 00:00:02.930
We've talked a little bit
about the law of demand which

00:00:02.930 --> 00:00:08.290
tells us all else equal, if we
raise the price of a product,

00:00:08.290 --> 00:00:11.290
then the quantity demanded
for that product will go down.

00:00:11.290 --> 00:00:12.270
Common sense.

00:00:12.270 --> 00:00:14.811
If we lower the price, than the
quantity demanded will go up,

00:00:14.811 --> 00:00:16.640
and we'll see a few
special cases for this.

00:00:16.640 --> 00:00:18.500
But what I want to do
in this video is focus

00:00:18.500 --> 00:00:21.230
on these other things that
we've been holding equal,

00:00:21.230 --> 00:00:23.460
the things that allow us to
make this statement, that

00:00:23.460 --> 00:00:25.400
allow us to move
along this curve,

00:00:25.400 --> 00:00:27.794
and think about if we were to
change one of those things,

00:00:27.794 --> 00:00:29.210
that we were
otherwise considering

00:00:29.210 --> 00:00:32.040
equal, how does that
change the actual curve?

00:00:32.040 --> 00:00:34.960
How does that actually
change the whole quantity

00:00:34.960 --> 00:00:37.160
demanded price relationship?

00:00:37.160 --> 00:00:40.080
And so the first of these
that I will focus on,

00:00:40.080 --> 00:00:42.790
the first is the price
of competing products.

00:00:50.530 --> 00:00:53.225
So if you assume that
the price of-- actually I

00:00:53.225 --> 00:00:54.600
shouldn't say
competing products,

00:00:54.600 --> 00:00:56.480
I'll say the price
of related products,

00:00:56.480 --> 00:00:59.720
because we'll see that
they're not competing.

00:00:59.720 --> 00:01:04.989
The price of related
products is one of the things

00:01:04.989 --> 00:01:08.860
that we're assuming is constant
when we, it's beheld equal when

00:01:08.860 --> 00:01:10.500
we show this relationship.

00:01:10.500 --> 00:01:13.490
We're assuming that these
other things aren't changing.

00:01:13.490 --> 00:01:16.610
Now, what would happen
if these things changed?

00:01:16.610 --> 00:01:28.120
Well, imagine we have,
say, other ebooks-- books

00:01:28.120 --> 00:01:32.940
is price-- price goes up.

00:01:32.940 --> 00:01:35.630
The price of other ebooks go up.

00:01:35.630 --> 00:01:37.720
So what will that
do to our price

00:01:37.720 --> 00:01:40.560
quantity demanded relationship?

00:01:40.560 --> 00:01:44.910
If other ebooks prices go up,
now all of a sudden, my ebook,

00:01:44.910 --> 00:01:47.070
regardless of what
price point we're at,

00:01:47.070 --> 00:01:49.410
at any of the price
points, my ebook

00:01:49.410 --> 00:01:51.390
is going to look more desirable.

00:01:51.390 --> 00:01:55.090
At $2, it's more likely
that people will want it,

00:01:55.090 --> 00:01:57.080
because the other
stuff's more expensive.

00:01:57.080 --> 00:02:00.530
At $4 more people will want it,
at $6 more people will want it,

00:02:00.530 --> 00:02:03.720
$8 more people will want it, at
$10 more people will want it.

00:02:03.720 --> 00:02:05.920
So if this were to happen,
that would actually

00:02:05.920 --> 00:02:09.370
shift the entire demand
curve to the right.

00:02:09.370 --> 00:02:11.390
So it would start to
look something like this.

00:02:17.060 --> 00:02:18.980
That is scenario one.

00:02:18.980 --> 00:02:20.830
And these other ebooks,
we can call them

00:02:20.830 --> 00:02:23.390
substitutes for my product.

00:02:23.390 --> 00:02:25.759
So this right over here,
these other ebooks,

00:02:25.759 --> 00:02:26.675
these are substitutes.

00:02:31.142 --> 00:02:33.350
People might say, oh, you
know, that other book looks

00:02:33.350 --> 00:02:35.183
kind of comparable, if
one is more expensive

00:02:35.183 --> 00:02:38.200
or one is cheaper, maybe
I'll read one or the other.

00:02:38.200 --> 00:02:40.390
So in order to make
this statement, in order

00:02:40.390 --> 00:02:42.510
to stay along this
curve, we have

00:02:42.510 --> 00:02:44.460
to assume that this
thing is constant.

00:02:44.460 --> 00:02:47.290
If this thing changes, this
is going to move the curve.

00:02:47.290 --> 00:02:49.040
If other ebooks
prices go up, it'll

00:02:49.040 --> 00:02:50.780
probably shift our
curve to the right.

00:02:50.780 --> 00:02:53.340
If other ebooks
prices go down, that

00:02:53.340 --> 00:02:55.780
will shift our entire
curve to the left.

00:02:55.780 --> 00:02:58.070
So this is actually
changing our demand.

00:02:58.070 --> 00:03:00.490
It's changing our
whole relationship.

00:03:00.490 --> 00:03:02.770
So it's shifting
demand to the right.

00:03:02.770 --> 00:03:03.660
So let me write that.

00:03:03.660 --> 00:03:08.470
So this is going
to shift demand.

00:03:08.470 --> 00:03:12.600
So the entire relationship,
demand, to the right.

00:03:12.600 --> 00:03:15.410
I really want to make sure
that you have this point clear.

00:03:15.410 --> 00:03:17.590
When we hold
everything else equal,

00:03:17.590 --> 00:03:20.580
we're moving along a
given demand curve.

00:03:20.580 --> 00:03:23.170
We're essentially saying
the demand, the price

00:03:23.170 --> 00:03:26.566
quantity demanded
relationship, is held constant,

00:03:26.566 --> 00:03:27.940
and we can pick
a price and we'll

00:03:27.940 --> 00:03:29.580
get a certain quantity demanded.

00:03:29.580 --> 00:03:32.150
We're moving along the curve.

00:03:32.150 --> 00:03:33.820
If we change one
of those things,

00:03:33.820 --> 00:03:36.350
we might actually
shift the curve.

00:03:36.350 --> 00:03:38.170
We'll actually change
this demand schedule,

00:03:38.170 --> 00:03:40.720
which will change this curve.

00:03:40.720 --> 00:03:43.460
Now, there other
related products,

00:03:43.460 --> 00:03:45.530
they don't just have
to be substitutes.

00:03:45.530 --> 00:03:49.800
So, for example, let's
think about scenario two.

00:03:49.800 --> 00:03:55.100
Or maybe the price
of a Kindle goes up.

00:03:59.830 --> 00:04:02.850
Let me write this this way.

00:04:02.850 --> 00:04:06.090
Kindle's price goes up.

00:04:06.090 --> 00:04:07.840
Now, the Kindle is
not a substitute.

00:04:07.840 --> 00:04:11.360
People don't either buy an
ebook or they won't either

00:04:11.360 --> 00:04:13.670
buy my ebook or a Kindle.

00:04:13.670 --> 00:04:14.720
Kindle is a compliment.

00:04:14.720 --> 00:04:17.920
You actually need a Kindle or
an iPad or something like it

00:04:17.920 --> 00:04:20.380
in order to consume my ebook.

00:04:20.380 --> 00:04:22.870
So this right over
here is a complement.

00:04:25.430 --> 00:04:28.350
So if a complement's price
becomes more expensive,

00:04:28.350 --> 00:04:30.110
and this is one of
the things people

00:04:30.110 --> 00:04:32.840
might use to buy my book,
then it would actually,

00:04:32.840 --> 00:04:36.160
for any given price, lower
the quantity demanded.

00:04:36.160 --> 00:04:37.950
So in this situation,
if my book is

00:04:37.950 --> 00:04:40.257
$2, since fewer people
are going to have Kindles,

00:04:40.257 --> 00:04:42.090
or since maybe they
used some of their money

00:04:42.090 --> 00:04:43.810
already to buy the
Kindle, they're

00:04:43.810 --> 00:04:45.820
going to have less to
buy my book or just fewer

00:04:45.820 --> 00:04:48.514
people will have the Kindle,
for any given price is going

00:04:48.514 --> 00:04:49.805
to lower the quantity demanded.

00:04:53.171 --> 00:04:54.670
And so it'll
essentially will shift,

00:04:54.670 --> 00:04:57.950
it'll change the entire demand
curve will shift the demand

00:04:57.950 --> 00:04:59.120
curve to the left.

00:04:59.120 --> 00:05:01.510
So this right over
here is scenario two.

00:05:01.510 --> 00:05:03.010
And you could imagine
the other way,

00:05:03.010 --> 00:05:05.430
if the Kindle's
price went down, then

00:05:05.430 --> 00:05:07.580
that would shift my
demand curve to the right.

00:05:07.580 --> 00:05:10.610
If the price of
substitutes went down,

00:05:10.610 --> 00:05:13.252
then that would shift my
entire curve to the left.

00:05:13.252 --> 00:05:14.960
So you can think about
all the scenarios,

00:05:14.960 --> 00:05:15.960
and actually I encourage you to.

00:05:15.960 --> 00:05:17.955
Think about drawing yourself,
think about for products,

00:05:17.955 --> 00:05:20.800
that could be an ebook or could
be some other type of product,

00:05:20.800 --> 00:05:22.380
and think about
what would happen.

00:05:22.380 --> 00:05:24.588
Well, one, think about what
the related products are,

00:05:24.588 --> 00:05:26.960
the substitutes and potentially
complements, and then

00:05:26.960 --> 00:05:29.610
think about what happen
as those prices change.

00:05:29.610 --> 00:05:32.450
And always keep in mind the
difference between demand,

00:05:32.450 --> 00:05:35.260
which is this entire
relationship, the entire curve

00:05:35.260 --> 00:05:38.250
that we can move along if we
hold everything else equal

00:05:38.250 --> 00:05:41.790
and only change price,
and quantity demanded,

00:05:41.790 --> 00:05:44.690
which is a particular quantity
for our particular price

00:05:44.690 --> 00:05:48.040
holding everything else equal.
