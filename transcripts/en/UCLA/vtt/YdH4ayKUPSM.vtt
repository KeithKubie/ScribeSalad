00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.730
I was a caregiver and a student so I
studied a lot of hours at this dining room

00:00:05.730 --> 00:00:10.800
table because it is my closest point of
contact to her room so I can hear her

00:00:10.800 --> 00:00:15.330
either with her buzzer or hear her call
my name so I can stop my studying

00:00:15.330 --> 00:00:19.940
they'll get to her and come back to
studying easily

00:00:25.260 --> 00:00:27.980
my grandmother was a teacher.

00:00:27.980 --> 00:00:31.240
so this is four generations this is my mother my

00:00:31.240 --> 00:00:37.000
grandmother my great-grandmother and
that's my sister as a child my time with

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:41.680
my grandmother and understanding what
education means has evolved from simple

00:00:41.680 --> 00:00:46.989
"you must learn cursive" to "you must think
critically" you must not accept the norm

00:00:46.989 --> 00:00:52.780
education is kind of your leg up that
will help you to be twice as good as

00:00:52.780 --> 00:00:57.250
everyone else because you do as a black
woman that's something she really conveyed

00:00:57.250 --> 00:01:03.790
to me can be mediocre so this is my
grandmother's kitchen and breakfast room

00:01:03.790 --> 00:01:09.009
I am currently in the instructor's chair
in my grandmother's hand there's a

00:01:09.009 --> 00:01:13.240
Highlights magazine she ordered a
subscription for me because it was

00:01:13.240 --> 00:01:17.770
something that she thought was fun she
would sit here she provided lined paper

00:01:17.770 --> 00:01:22.450
the old school lined paper with the
dotted line in the middle and I would

00:01:22.450 --> 00:01:27.909
practice my cursive because she was so
upset that teachers were not teaching

00:01:27.909 --> 00:01:33.520
cursive in elementary school by the time
that I got there she was not easily

00:01:33.520 --> 00:01:39.009
impressed the world is not usually
impressed my professors are not easily

00:01:39.009 --> 00:01:44.530
impressed being ready to meet any
obstacle with a faith and sense of self

00:01:44.530 --> 00:01:50.859
that is so unwavering that I think she
gave me this is our living space my

00:01:50.859 --> 00:01:55.090
sister and I brought a TV in here and
this was a great way for us to include

00:01:55.090 --> 00:02:00.549
our grandmother one when we had company over
but to just kind of get her out of her

00:02:00.549 --> 00:02:04.899
room oh my gosh
she loved Blue Bloods she also really

00:02:04.899 --> 00:02:10.929
liked Family Feud and The Colbert Report
my grandmother wanted to live to see me

00:02:10.929 --> 00:02:16.360
graduate but I think her her passing
just a couple of months before kind of

00:02:16.360 --> 00:02:21.819
created an impetus of me framing my
mind that this gap year that I'm taking

00:02:21.819 --> 00:02:24.960
before going in to grad
school should be about learning yourself

00:02:24.960 --> 00:02:28.530
and loving yourself and just figuring
out what it means to take care of

00:02:28.530 --> 00:02:33.510
yourself outside of the context of UCLA
student or a caregiver, daughter, sister

00:02:33.510 --> 00:02:38.730
etc I would work on my research whether
it be writing in manuscripts creating a

00:02:38.730 --> 00:02:44.220
poster doing a literature review and
just as I saw those things or as I found

00:02:44.220 --> 00:02:47.910
things on the internet I would ask her
opinion and in that way she was able to

00:02:47.910 --> 00:02:52.010
give a lot of feedback and input and ask
critical questions about my research

00:02:52.010 --> 00:02:57.300
share our time share our energy through
love and that's what this experience

00:02:57.300 --> 00:03:01.890
taught me how to love someone
unconditionally whether they're mean because

00:03:01.890 --> 00:03:06.930
they're in pain right now I had to come
home and cook dinner and serve it and

00:03:06.930 --> 00:03:12.450
make sure everything is good for the
next day when she died even for like at

00:03:12.450 --> 00:03:15.750
least a month after I would wake up in
the morning and still have those thoughts

00:03:15.750 --> 00:03:19.860
are the caregivers here is there
bacon for breakfast are there croissants

00:03:19.860 --> 00:03:24.239
I live in this home because my
grandmother invested her time and

00:03:24.239 --> 00:03:30.450
resources wisely and into us so ultimately
this life is about learning to bend

00:03:30.450 --> 00:03:36.060
for others and to use your resources
your time your energy for the betterment

00:03:36.060 --> 00:03:41.160
of your village
