00:00:05.460 --> 00:00:10.680
PROFESSOR: Visualizing Cultures
is a web-based history program

00:00:10.680 --> 00:00:14.880
which John Dower and I
started in year 2001.

00:00:14.880 --> 00:00:19.590
John Dower is an eminent
historian of modern Japan.

00:00:19.590 --> 00:00:22.620
He won the Pulitzer
Prize in 1999

00:00:22.620 --> 00:00:26.400
for his book Embracing Defeat.

00:00:26.400 --> 00:00:34.200
I approached John in 2000 when
I knew that OpenCourseWare

00:00:34.200 --> 00:00:36.060
was about to go up.

00:00:36.060 --> 00:00:39.060
And I told John that
I thought that this

00:00:39.060 --> 00:00:45.330
would be a great platform to
do something new with history,

00:00:45.330 --> 00:00:50.010
specifically to look at history,
not just from text, which

00:00:50.010 --> 00:00:56.220
is what historians do, but from
looking at images, visuals that

00:00:56.220 --> 00:01:03.840
have been produced by people
from the historical era,

00:01:03.840 --> 00:01:07.890
and to try to understand
what was going on.

00:01:07.890 --> 00:01:15.330
John suprisingly said
yes, and so we started.

00:01:15.330 --> 00:01:18.900
We didn't quite know what
we were doing at first,

00:01:18.900 --> 00:01:22.830
but we got very lucky
with our first unit, which

00:01:22.830 --> 00:01:27.450
is Commodore Matthew
Perry's arrival in Japan

00:01:27.450 --> 00:01:33.000
in 1853, to open up Japan, which
had been essentially isolated,

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:35.340
closed, for 250 years.

00:01:35.340 --> 00:01:41.190
And so you have America and
Japan come clashing together

00:01:41.190 --> 00:01:43.550
in this one moment in history.

00:01:43.550 --> 00:01:48.990
And from that, this explosion
of images from both sides--

00:01:48.990 --> 00:01:52.590
Americans depicting
the Japanese,

00:01:52.590 --> 00:01:56.020
and Japanese depicting Perry
and his men and his ships.

00:01:56.020 --> 00:01:58.440
It's just wonderful.

00:01:58.440 --> 00:02:01.830
And what's really interesting
is that when you look at images,

00:02:01.830 --> 00:02:04.620
you get to see things that
you cannot get from written

00:02:04.620 --> 00:02:06.720
material.

00:02:06.720 --> 00:02:10.139
We found lots of images where
the Japanese were really

00:02:10.139 --> 00:02:18.210
curious about Perry's men and
drawing costumes, instruments,

00:02:18.210 --> 00:02:23.940
weapons in minute
detail, and with notes

00:02:23.940 --> 00:02:28.480
to go along with them, showing
just sort of sheer curiosity.

00:02:28.480 --> 00:02:30.360
Who are these people?

00:02:30.360 --> 00:02:31.710
How do they live?

00:02:31.710 --> 00:02:33.516
How do they talk?

00:02:33.516 --> 00:02:35.930
And you saw the same
thing on Perry's side.

00:02:35.930 --> 00:02:40.080
Perry brought his
own artist, Heine,

00:02:40.080 --> 00:02:48.060
who was a 26-year-old artist
trained in Germany in sort

00:02:48.060 --> 00:02:50.890
of the romantic style.

00:02:50.890 --> 00:02:53.880
He just fell in love with Japan.

00:02:53.880 --> 00:02:55.410
You can tell that in the images.

00:02:55.410 --> 00:02:58.674
He absolutely fell in love
with this beautiful country,

00:02:58.674 --> 00:03:00.090
so much so that
he would sometimes

00:03:00.090 --> 00:03:04.440
paint himself into the picture,
interacting with the Japanese.

00:03:04.440 --> 00:03:07.140
And so what you got
was this one artist

00:03:07.140 --> 00:03:10.440
depicting Japan in a
very beautiful, very

00:03:10.440 --> 00:03:13.320
affectionate way.

00:03:13.320 --> 00:03:18.750
And that's what Americans saw
of Japan for the first time.

00:03:18.750 --> 00:03:21.510
This is why even to this
day, in this country,

00:03:21.510 --> 00:03:27.030
you have this image of Japan
as very beautiful, very

00:03:27.030 --> 00:03:28.350
beautiful nature.

00:03:28.350 --> 00:03:31.710
It really originates
with Heine's paintings.

00:03:31.710 --> 00:03:36.450
And so we very much
follow the OCW principle

00:03:36.450 --> 00:03:41.070
of not only making it
available and open and free,

00:03:41.070 --> 00:03:44.820
but that everything is
licensed under Creative Commons

00:03:44.820 --> 00:03:51.570
so that these images, which we
got from about 200 museums--

00:03:51.570 --> 00:03:53.250
and these are major museums.

00:03:53.250 --> 00:03:56.310
Boston MFA, Sackler
in Washington,

00:03:56.310 --> 00:03:59.550
Hong Kong, British Museum--

00:03:59.550 --> 00:04:03.960
we asked all of them
to sign an agreement

00:04:03.960 --> 00:04:09.180
that we could present
their images on Visualizing

00:04:09.180 --> 00:04:12.630
Japan on OpenCourseWare
under Creative Commons.

00:04:12.630 --> 00:04:18.510
And so anyone coming in and
studying Visualizing Cultures

00:04:18.510 --> 00:04:23.880
can take images and copy them,
distribute them, alter them

00:04:23.880 --> 00:04:30.120
into their own material and
use them however, they wish.

00:04:30.120 --> 00:04:33.870
One of the populations that
we really wanted to work with

00:04:33.870 --> 00:04:36.060
were schoolteachers.

00:04:36.060 --> 00:04:40.170
And so we did many, many
workshops over the years,

00:04:40.170 --> 00:04:47.920
and we trained face-to-face
around 2,000 teachers.

00:04:47.920 --> 00:04:48.705
I say we.

00:04:48.705 --> 00:04:55.290
We worked with a wonderful group
out of University of Colorado

00:04:55.290 --> 00:04:59.040
that specializes in creating
East Asian curriculum

00:04:59.040 --> 00:05:01.020
and working with
teachers directly

00:05:01.020 --> 00:05:04.470
to help them to incorporate
them into their classroom.

00:05:04.470 --> 00:05:10.940
And so they ran these series of
workshops all over the country.

00:05:10.940 --> 00:05:15.440
And as far as I know,
it's still being used.

00:05:15.440 --> 00:05:19.250
So high school teachers,
university professors

00:05:19.250 --> 00:05:23.350
tell us that they're using
it on a regular basis.

00:05:23.350 --> 00:05:27.230
A couple of years
ago, a university

00:05:27.230 --> 00:05:31.340
had an opening for assistant
professor in Japanese history,

00:05:31.340 --> 00:05:35.060
and they had four finalists.

00:05:35.060 --> 00:05:37.850
And they asked them how do
you teach Japanese history.

00:05:37.850 --> 00:05:40.070
And three of them
apparently said

00:05:40.070 --> 00:05:42.610
they used Visualizing Cultures.
