NILOFER MERCHANT: Today, any
individual has access to

00:00:05.650 --> 00:00:08.750
information that 20 years ago,
only the richest billionaire

00:00:08.750 --> 00:00:10.880
had access to.

00:00:10.880 --> 00:00:13.930
Seems kind of obvious, right,
to this audience of people?

00:00:13.930 --> 00:00:16.990
And yet, the implications for
business, and business models,

00:00:16.990 --> 00:00:19.320
and what creates power in those
business models, it

00:00:19.320 --> 00:00:21.560
changes everything.

00:00:21.560 --> 00:00:23.520
So I wanted to spend a little
bit of time talking about the

00:00:23.520 --> 00:00:26.110
business models, what changes,
what it means for us as

00:00:26.110 --> 00:00:29.200
leaders, and what I think people
can do, especially some

00:00:29.200 --> 00:00:31.200
of you who might be going out
and maybe starting your own

00:00:31.200 --> 00:00:34.340
companies post Google, what I
think that means for you as

00:00:34.340 --> 00:00:35.990
entrepreneurs.

00:00:35.990 --> 00:00:37.750
So the gorillas of the
marketplace, the way

00:00:37.750 --> 00:00:40.460
organizations had power, here
are some of the constructs

00:00:40.460 --> 00:00:41.560
that they considered.

00:00:41.560 --> 00:00:46.520
One was that being bigger than
everyone else meant that they

00:00:46.520 --> 00:00:49.060
could have pricing power in the
marketplace, meant that

00:00:49.060 --> 00:00:53.040
they could control which
suppliers they had access to.

00:00:53.040 --> 00:00:55.410
It meant that they had this
thing called sustainable

00:00:55.410 --> 00:00:57.790
competitive advantage.

00:00:57.790 --> 00:00:59.400
Sustainable competitive
advantage has now

00:00:59.400 --> 00:01:01.190
gone from 40 years--

00:01:01.190 --> 00:01:02.310
long arcs--

00:01:02.310 --> 00:01:05.940
to 12 years in old industries,
and 5 in fast moving

00:01:05.940 --> 00:01:06.590
industries.

00:01:06.590 --> 00:01:08.370
So it's really hard to use
that term, sustainable

00:01:08.370 --> 00:01:10.350
competitive advantage, anymore
because it doesn't mean the

00:01:10.350 --> 00:01:11.480
same thing.

00:01:11.480 --> 00:01:14.140
Any advantage that an old
organization had when they

00:01:14.140 --> 00:01:16.900
tried to build up a moat around
their business actually

00:01:16.900 --> 00:01:18.660
doesn't hold true.

00:01:18.660 --> 00:01:21.410
And in fact, the first chapter
of "Social Era" starts with an

00:01:21.410 --> 00:01:25.450
obituary to this character,
traditional strategy.

00:01:25.450 --> 00:01:28.310
And I, basically, say it was
good while we had you.

00:01:28.310 --> 00:01:29.530
You had a good life.

00:01:29.530 --> 00:01:31.000
But you're dead now.

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:34.220
And we ought to honor the
rules of a new era.

00:01:34.220 --> 00:01:37.860
But gorillas, these big
organizations, are actually

00:01:37.860 --> 00:01:40.340
facing all the changes in the
marketplace, whether it was

00:01:40.340 --> 00:01:43.180
crowd sourcing, or SaaS plays,
or the things that

00:01:43.180 --> 00:01:45.920
fundamentally lowered the cost
structure of having an

00:01:45.920 --> 00:01:46.920
organization.

00:01:46.920 --> 00:01:50.200
And they're looking at it and
thinking to themselves, all

00:01:50.200 --> 00:01:53.390
this is really causing me to
have to compete against a much

00:01:53.390 --> 00:01:54.710
leaner organization.

00:01:54.710 --> 00:01:57.130
And so it's almost like they sit
there and they think, how

00:01:57.130 --> 00:01:59.250
do I go on a diet?

00:01:59.250 --> 00:02:01.510
But they're missing the
fundamental construct that

00:02:01.510 --> 00:02:03.940
something so big and
shifted that it's

00:02:03.940 --> 00:02:07.700
not just about Spandex--

00:02:07.700 --> 00:02:10.889
sorry for such a girl
reference there.

00:02:10.889 --> 00:02:12.650
Women wear these things
called Spanx.

00:02:12.650 --> 00:02:14.900
Any of you have ever
heard of Spanx?

00:02:14.900 --> 00:02:16.000
Men also have them.

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:17.360
But I'd be really scared if one
of you guys admitted that

00:02:17.360 --> 00:02:19.960
you wore Spanx.

00:02:19.960 --> 00:02:22.570
Apparently Roger Moore in the
James Bond movies, because he

00:02:22.570 --> 00:02:25.030
wasn't in good shape,
actually wore Spanx.

00:02:25.030 --> 00:02:26.670
That was the early generation
of Spanx.

00:02:26.670 --> 00:02:28.800
There you go.

00:02:28.800 --> 00:02:30.210
Trivia.

00:02:30.210 --> 00:02:32.170
So big organizations are
often thinking--

00:02:32.170 --> 00:02:34.290
seeing all these things and
seeing that they're performing

00:02:34.290 --> 00:02:36.840
against these lighter based
companies-- and thinking, I've

00:02:36.840 --> 00:02:40.110
just got to figure out how
to do more with less.

00:02:40.110 --> 00:02:42.650
And I think that's actually
a false architecture.

00:02:42.650 --> 00:02:45.190
Instead I think there's
something

00:02:45.190 --> 00:02:46.790
entirely new coming on.

00:02:46.790 --> 00:02:49.610
And I call that thing
the social era.

00:02:49.610 --> 00:02:52.490
And as I talk about social, most
people finish the word

00:02:52.490 --> 00:02:54.830
social with the word media.

00:02:54.830 --> 00:02:57.760
So I just want to slow down and
say, for me, social is not

00:02:57.760 --> 00:02:58.080
about media.

00:02:58.080 --> 00:03:00.390
It's not a marketing or
communications thing.

00:03:00.390 --> 00:03:02.000
And in fact, it might just be
helpful to kind of make some

00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:05.520
distinctions about other key
terms that people have used.

00:03:05.520 --> 00:03:09.600
So social media, obviously,
was created around the

00:03:09.600 --> 00:03:11.130
Cluetrain Manifesto.

00:03:11.130 --> 00:03:12.630
It's done a great thing
in the world.

00:03:12.630 --> 00:03:17.320
It's like the Red Bull
of organizations.

00:03:17.320 --> 00:03:20.340
Makes you maybe go faster,
accelerate communications, and

00:03:20.340 --> 00:03:21.200
the speed of communications.

00:03:21.200 --> 00:03:22.480
So it is like Red Bull
in that way.

00:03:22.480 --> 00:03:26.000
But it's still just about
communications and creating a

00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:27.860
dialogue versus a monologue.

00:03:27.860 --> 00:03:28.670
Enterprise 2.0.

00:03:28.670 --> 00:03:30.950
How many of you guys have
heard that term?

00:03:30.950 --> 00:03:32.530
Oh, not so much this group.

00:03:32.530 --> 00:03:35.190
So Enterprise 2.0 was coined
by Andrew McAfee

00:03:35.190 --> 00:03:36.500
about six years ago.

00:03:36.500 --> 00:03:38.790
And the idea was that the
tools would allow

00:03:38.790 --> 00:03:41.360
organizations to function
differently.

00:03:41.360 --> 00:03:43.430
Peter Kim actually came up
with this idea of social

00:03:43.430 --> 00:03:45.040
business and actually kind
of stole the term

00:03:45.040 --> 00:03:46.130
from Muhammad Yunus.

00:03:46.130 --> 00:03:48.700
Muhammad Yunus said, social
business we can actually care

00:03:48.700 --> 00:03:50.600
about meaning and work.

00:03:50.600 --> 00:03:53.330
And Peter Kim came along and
said-- and he was working at

00:03:53.330 --> 00:03:55.430
Dachis Group at the time, which
is a marketing agency--

00:03:55.430 --> 00:03:56.730
said, you know what?

00:03:56.730 --> 00:03:59.370
What if we could actually use
these tools to actually create

00:03:59.370 --> 00:04:02.530
wealth and exchange across all
the players, so not just

00:04:02.530 --> 00:04:05.230
shareholders but customers,
community.

00:04:05.230 --> 00:04:06.450
So thinking about it that way.

00:04:06.450 --> 00:04:08.590
But he fundamentally didn't
challenge whether or not an

00:04:08.590 --> 00:04:11.340
organization was still needed.

00:04:11.340 --> 00:04:13.730
And so in "Social Era," I'm
basically saying two things.

00:04:17.180 --> 00:04:22.330
One is, just as a comparison
point, in the industrial era

00:04:22.330 --> 00:04:26.570
when oil, and capital,
land, limited

00:04:26.570 --> 00:04:29.190
resources were at play.

00:04:29.190 --> 00:04:31.150
Then what you needed was
an organization that

00:04:31.150 --> 00:04:32.540
could create scale.

00:04:32.540 --> 00:04:35.240
And value was fundamentally
about what an organization

00:04:35.240 --> 00:04:37.360
could do and you had to belong
within the walls of that

00:04:37.360 --> 00:04:39.060
organization to create value.

00:04:39.060 --> 00:04:41.190
"Social Era," it's exactly
the opposite.

00:04:41.190 --> 00:04:45.040
It starts with a single,
connected human.

00:04:45.040 --> 00:04:47.805
Whether or not you belong to an
organization, or work for

00:04:47.805 --> 00:04:52.550
an organization, pretty much
a secondary effect.

00:04:52.550 --> 00:04:56.330
And so what that changes is
why are we all together?

00:04:56.330 --> 00:04:58.410
And if there's all those people
out there who could be

00:04:58.410 --> 00:05:00.410
creating value with us,
how do we engage that?

00:05:00.410 --> 00:05:02.080
So that's the institutional
view.

00:05:02.080 --> 00:05:05.360
And then, at an individual
level, it changes because we

00:05:05.360 --> 00:05:08.910
get to start thinking about
ourselves not just am I an

00:05:08.910 --> 00:05:11.140
employee of such and such?

00:05:11.140 --> 00:05:14.800
But what is this unit of value
creation that I bring?

00:05:14.800 --> 00:05:17.030
And where do I want to
plug that unit--

00:05:17.030 --> 00:05:18.550
such a mechanical term--

00:05:18.550 --> 00:05:19.920
into?

00:05:19.920 --> 00:05:22.020
If I'm a LEGO block, what other
LEGO blocks do I want to

00:05:22.020 --> 00:05:24.670
go join with so I can
start creating value

00:05:24.670 --> 00:05:27.470
and build from there?

00:05:27.470 --> 00:05:31.220
The shift changes how we think
about leadership, how we think

00:05:31.220 --> 00:05:34.690
about business models, how we
think about even just when we

00:05:34.690 --> 00:05:35.980
think about scaling.

00:05:35.980 --> 00:05:37.230
What is scaling?

00:05:38.980 --> 00:05:40.490
So I'll give you a couple
examples of how

00:05:40.490 --> 00:05:41.690
that comes to play.

00:05:41.690 --> 00:05:43.460
Singularity University, how
many of you guys know

00:05:43.460 --> 00:05:45.720
Singularity because it's
here in the Valley?

00:05:45.720 --> 00:05:45.980
There you go.

00:05:45.980 --> 00:05:48.320
Big group.

00:05:48.320 --> 00:05:50.310
Aimed at people who have
already gotten graduate

00:05:50.310 --> 00:05:53.650
degrees but who fundamentally
want to change the world.

00:05:53.650 --> 00:05:56.550
And their idea was instead
of teaching people

00:05:56.550 --> 00:05:58.630
backward-looking information,
let's teach them

00:05:58.630 --> 00:06:00.430
forward-looking information
because if they're going to be

00:06:00.430 --> 00:06:03.900
true change agents in the
world, they need that.

00:06:03.900 --> 00:06:06.350
But that changes really often.

00:06:06.350 --> 00:06:09.630
What is new and current three
years ago is not as new and

00:06:09.630 --> 00:06:10.950
current today.

00:06:10.950 --> 00:06:13.080
And so you have to build an
organizational construct that

00:06:13.080 --> 00:06:15.580
is fundamentally designed for
speed for that kind of

00:06:15.580 --> 00:06:17.050
flexibility.

00:06:17.050 --> 00:06:21.190
So they deliver almost 400 hours
of curriculum with seven

00:06:21.190 --> 00:06:23.240
full-time staff.

00:06:23.240 --> 00:06:26.010
That seven full-time staff
basically hold the mission of

00:06:26.010 --> 00:06:27.350
the organization.

00:06:27.350 --> 00:06:30.510
And then they recruit
the next group.

00:06:30.510 --> 00:06:33.470
The next group, that sort of
10 thought leaders across

00:06:33.470 --> 00:06:36.630
robotics, and biomedical stuff,
and so on, tissue

00:06:36.630 --> 00:06:41.120
engineering, really innovative
stuff, that 10 people then go

00:06:41.120 --> 00:06:43.840
find the next 20 people who are
the leaders in the field.

00:06:43.840 --> 00:06:45.690
20 people can happen
from anywhere.

00:06:45.690 --> 00:06:48.710
So inherently global, inherently
social, using

00:06:48.710 --> 00:06:50.930
collaborative technologies to
bring them all together.

00:06:50.930 --> 00:06:53.220
No one needs to be in one
particular place.

00:06:53.220 --> 00:06:54.440
They come in.

00:06:54.440 --> 00:06:56.060
They deliver their
piece of value.

00:06:56.060 --> 00:06:57.200
They leave again.

00:06:57.200 --> 00:07:00.670
At the end of every semester,
it collapses all back down.

00:07:00.670 --> 00:07:03.570
So you sit there, and you go,
what do we need to actually

00:07:03.570 --> 00:07:05.210
deliver next semester?

00:07:05.210 --> 00:07:08.390
Change is built into the
organizational design.

00:07:08.390 --> 00:07:10.680
Change is built into how they
even think about things.

00:07:10.680 --> 00:07:14.400
So it's not how do we protect
and maintain tenured staff, or

00:07:14.400 --> 00:07:15.890
these buildings, right?

00:07:15.890 --> 00:07:19.110
But what is it we really want
to be called to do?

00:07:19.110 --> 00:07:21.960
And then what is the way in
which we'll modularly figure

00:07:21.960 --> 00:07:24.250
out who needs to belong
as part of our tribe?

00:07:24.250 --> 00:07:26.610
Those people certainly are
affiliated with Singularity

00:07:26.610 --> 00:07:29.020
University in the sense that
some of the best leaders in

00:07:29.020 --> 00:07:31.070
the world come and
teach there.

00:07:31.070 --> 00:07:33.540
They don't work for
that institution.

00:07:33.540 --> 00:07:35.960
And the institution gets to get
value from that exchange.

00:07:39.520 --> 00:07:40.440
TED.

00:07:40.440 --> 00:07:42.790
Probably everyone in this group
has watched a TED video.

00:07:42.790 --> 00:07:44.700
Yes?

00:07:44.700 --> 00:07:48.770
So TED actually started out as
a really elite conference--

00:07:48.770 --> 00:07:50.790
originally one, now two--

00:07:50.790 --> 00:07:52.640
where just a couple, maybe
like 1,000, people

00:07:52.640 --> 00:07:54.320
participated.

00:07:54.320 --> 00:07:58.035
And as those people came
together, they would come and

00:07:58.035 --> 00:07:58.960
they'd be influential
and stuff.

00:07:58.960 --> 00:08:00.110
But then they'd leave.

00:08:00.110 --> 00:08:01.970
And four years ago or so they
said, you know, maybe we

00:08:01.970 --> 00:08:04.220
should share the talks
that are happening.

00:08:04.220 --> 00:08:05.750
We should share them online.

00:08:05.750 --> 00:08:08.130
So they started doing something
with YouTube to

00:08:08.130 --> 00:08:10.580
share videos as they were
being created by the

00:08:10.580 --> 00:08:13.530
conference, which upped the
production level and focused

00:08:13.530 --> 00:08:14.280
all that, which is good.

00:08:14.280 --> 00:08:16.030
Sharing free, good.

00:08:16.030 --> 00:08:19.170
But the thing that really made
TED more powerful is they

00:08:19.170 --> 00:08:21.280
figured out there were actually
some people that

00:08:21.280 --> 00:08:23.440
might want to create TED
conferences, too.

00:08:23.440 --> 00:08:24.490
TEDxes.

00:08:24.490 --> 00:08:26.480
And so they created this
little sub-brand.

00:08:26.480 --> 00:08:29.286
And to hear them tell the story
is they thought maybe

00:08:29.286 --> 00:08:32.880
five, maybe 10 people might be
interested in doing these

00:08:32.880 --> 00:08:35.730
things because, of course, it
will take a lot of work.

00:08:35.730 --> 00:08:36.900
You have to curate
all the speakers.

00:08:36.900 --> 00:08:40.370
You have to be really attentive
to holding an event.

00:08:40.370 --> 00:08:42.049
There's just a ton of
details to manage.

00:08:42.049 --> 00:08:45.060
So five, maybe 10.

00:08:45.060 --> 00:08:48.730
Since then, three years later,
5,000 events have happened

00:08:48.730 --> 00:08:50.060
around the world.

00:08:50.060 --> 00:08:54.960
22,000 hours of content has been
created in the process.

00:08:54.960 --> 00:08:59.940
And about 220 of those talks
have been posted on ted.com.

00:08:59.940 --> 00:09:02.200
So TED has figured out
how to create scale.

00:09:02.200 --> 00:09:05.460
Ted.com being incredibly
exclusive.

00:09:05.460 --> 00:09:07.600
Very, very small staff
of people curate

00:09:07.600 --> 00:09:08.820
what goes on ted.com.

00:09:08.820 --> 00:09:11.570
Ted conferences being semi open
in that you have to apply

00:09:11.570 --> 00:09:13.440
and be relatively
rich to get in.

00:09:13.440 --> 00:09:17.830
And then TEDx open to all people
who want to both create

00:09:17.830 --> 00:09:20.990
the event as well as people who
want to attend an event.

00:09:20.990 --> 00:09:22.430
Scale.

00:09:22.430 --> 00:09:25.000
If you tried to do that
with a budget--

00:09:25.000 --> 00:09:28.320
just think about a traditional
organization like GE or I

00:09:28.320 --> 00:09:30.970
don't know, Xerox.

00:09:30.970 --> 00:09:33.180
The idea of TEDx just
kind of would--

00:09:33.180 --> 00:09:37.680
they're baffled by it because
they think we should do it.

00:09:37.680 --> 00:09:41.070
And so scale for them is much
more about we hire the people,

00:09:41.070 --> 00:09:43.490
we have the buildings,
we have the staff.

00:09:43.490 --> 00:09:45.090
So that's the gorilla
mentality.

00:09:45.090 --> 00:09:47.645
And of course, the
opposite is TEDx.

00:09:47.645 --> 00:09:48.810
It's gazelles.

00:09:48.810 --> 00:09:52.650
It's how 800 unique parties
are getting together and

00:09:52.650 --> 00:09:55.120
figuring out how to
create value.

00:09:55.120 --> 00:09:59.060
And of course, since TEDx has
started, they've had all these

00:09:59.060 --> 00:10:00.740
beautiful events all
over the earth.

00:10:00.740 --> 00:10:01.720
Brene Brown is the speaker
in the middle.

00:10:01.720 --> 00:10:04.270
And she now has 10 million views
on a talk she gave at

00:10:04.270 --> 00:10:07.030
TEDx Houston.

00:10:07.030 --> 00:10:11.380
These really flexible constructs
can apply to every

00:10:11.380 --> 00:10:13.800
part of a business.

00:10:13.800 --> 00:10:16.360
And for most traditional
organizations, they actually

00:10:16.360 --> 00:10:17.210
don't see that.

00:10:17.210 --> 00:10:19.070
So that's one of the reasons
I created this table.

00:10:19.070 --> 00:10:22.280
But in HR, the Singularity
University example shows that

00:10:22.280 --> 00:10:24.050
you don't have to have employees
creating value.

00:10:24.050 --> 00:10:27.450
In service, it used to be that
you used to have call centers.

00:10:27.450 --> 00:10:28.900
And those people worked for
you even if they were

00:10:28.900 --> 00:10:30.730
outsourced to a different
country.

00:10:30.730 --> 00:10:35.130
And McAfee mavens, or Intuit
accountants, are two examples

00:10:35.130 --> 00:10:37.080
where communities of people
actually provide

00:10:37.080 --> 00:10:38.300
peer to peer support.

00:10:38.300 --> 00:10:40.690
Intuit accountants now
answer 74% of all the

00:10:40.690 --> 00:10:42.220
questions peer to peer.

00:10:42.220 --> 00:10:45.270
And the staff has really
gotten the

00:10:45.270 --> 00:10:45.940
chance to step back.

00:10:45.940 --> 00:10:48.470
But what's more interesting,
right, is that the community

00:10:48.470 --> 00:10:52.070
of people is actually adding
value on to that platform.

00:10:52.070 --> 00:10:53.080
Capitalization.

00:10:53.080 --> 00:10:54.660
Everyone in this room has
probably heard about

00:10:54.660 --> 00:10:57.240
Kickstarter and all the various
ways in which you can

00:10:57.240 --> 00:10:58.790
fund something.

00:10:58.790 --> 00:11:00.440
But people aren't just
getting money.

00:11:00.440 --> 00:11:02.410
They're actually showing an
investment in the person.

00:11:02.410 --> 00:11:03.770
It's a community.

00:11:03.770 --> 00:11:05.990
And the way they're putting $1
into that system actually

00:11:05.990 --> 00:11:10.520
changes how committed they
are to that act.

00:11:10.520 --> 00:11:11.770
I just invested in Everpurse.

00:11:14.320 --> 00:11:16.270
So it charges a phone up.

00:11:16.270 --> 00:11:18.080
Woman, entrepreneur.

00:11:18.080 --> 00:11:21.320
Women get less than 3% of
all venture fundings.

00:11:21.320 --> 00:11:24.040
And so her chance of getting
access to capital on her own,

00:11:24.040 --> 00:11:26.560
pretty low just if you think
about the stats on that.

00:11:26.560 --> 00:11:27.120
But here she is.

00:11:27.120 --> 00:11:27.990
She went out to the community.

00:11:27.990 --> 00:11:30.270
She figured out how to change
the phone charging process.

00:11:30.270 --> 00:11:32.270
So if you're out for a
day, your phone will

00:11:32.270 --> 00:11:33.740
almost always run out.

00:11:33.740 --> 00:11:36.110
But this purse, as you put the
phone back in the purse

00:11:36.110 --> 00:11:37.050
actually charges the purse.

00:11:37.050 --> 00:11:40.010
You have a secondary recharge
unit basically available to

00:11:40.010 --> 00:11:41.260
you at all times.

00:11:41.260 --> 00:11:42.730
Worth investing in
because it's just

00:11:42.730 --> 00:11:43.540
such a creative idea.

00:11:43.540 --> 00:11:44.720
And of course, now
has raised--

00:11:44.720 --> 00:11:46.480
I think she's up
to $2 million.

00:11:46.480 --> 00:11:49.620
And the product's going
into production.

00:11:49.620 --> 00:11:51.720
Product used to be about
we make it once and

00:11:51.720 --> 00:11:53.070
sell it many times.

00:11:53.070 --> 00:11:56.710
And all the examples online are
about, whether it's Etsy

00:11:56.710 --> 00:11:59.660
or gosh, what's the
t-shirt company?

00:11:59.660 --> 00:12:01.490
Threadless, which I remember a
couple of years ago, I was

00:12:01.490 --> 00:12:02.770
obsessed with.

00:12:02.770 --> 00:12:05.240
All different ways in which we
can create custom production.

00:12:05.240 --> 00:12:07.220
Desktop Factory, which
actually allows

00:12:07.220 --> 00:12:08.800
you to do 3D printing.

00:12:08.800 --> 00:12:09.360
I love it.

00:12:09.360 --> 00:12:11.120
Somebody sent in a
picture of a dog.

00:12:11.120 --> 00:12:12.870
And they built a little
miniature dog.

00:12:12.870 --> 00:12:13.920
And I'm like, how interesting.

00:12:13.920 --> 00:12:15.130
One day, you could actually
build like a

00:12:15.130 --> 00:12:16.420
real big sized dog.

00:12:16.420 --> 00:12:19.380
But there are just so many ways
in which the product is

00:12:19.380 --> 00:12:21.760
not a product, it's
our product.

00:12:21.760 --> 00:12:25.580
It's a thing we care about
so much that the value

00:12:25.580 --> 00:12:28.000
proposition changes because it's
not just about a thing

00:12:28.000 --> 00:12:29.150
somebody else has made.

00:12:29.150 --> 00:12:31.010
It's about a thing we've
made together.

00:12:31.010 --> 00:12:32.330
And when you've made
something together,

00:12:32.330 --> 00:12:34.192
you're not selling it.

00:12:34.192 --> 00:12:35.900
You don't have to sell the thing
you've made together.

00:12:38.800 --> 00:12:39.970
Distribution.

00:12:39.970 --> 00:12:41.730
Certainly Amazon to Etsy.

00:12:41.730 --> 00:12:44.030
Tons of examples of open
marketplaces changing

00:12:44.030 --> 00:12:44.830
distribution.

00:12:44.830 --> 00:12:45.870
Supply chain.

00:12:45.870 --> 00:12:47.920
How many of you guys use LEGO
Factory when they were doing

00:12:47.920 --> 00:12:49.143
the custom stuff.

00:12:49.143 --> 00:12:49.930
Anybody?

00:12:49.930 --> 00:12:51.450
What did you build?

00:12:51.450 --> 00:12:54.400
AUDIENCE: We just built more
"Star Wars" stuff.

00:12:54.400 --> 00:12:55.700
NILOFER MERCHANT: Oh, more
"Star Wars" stuff.

00:12:55.700 --> 00:12:57.040
OK, and what did you build?

00:12:57.040 --> 00:12:58.230
AUDIENCE: Hubble telescope.

00:12:58.230 --> 00:12:59.870
NILOFER MERCHANT: A
public telescope?

00:12:59.870 --> 00:13:00.500
AUDIENCE: Hubble telescope.

00:13:00.500 --> 00:13:03.090
NILOFER MERCHANT: Wow,
you're kidding.

00:13:03.090 --> 00:13:04.170
AUDIENCE: It used to
be that there was a

00:13:04.170 --> 00:13:06.640
set back in the '70s.

00:13:06.640 --> 00:13:07.628
It was discontinued.

00:13:07.628 --> 00:13:07.956
I'm sorry.

00:13:07.956 --> 00:13:11.086
In the '80s, then it
was discontinued.

00:13:11.086 --> 00:13:11.580
NILOFER MERCHANT:
There you go.

00:13:11.580 --> 00:13:13.460
So people have sent in houses.

00:13:13.460 --> 00:13:14.950
You can build anything.

00:13:14.950 --> 00:13:16.800
And for a long time, people
were actually sending in

00:13:16.800 --> 00:13:20.560
pictures of their kids because
it's really a way for you not

00:13:20.560 --> 00:13:21.810
to just have a LEGO set.

00:13:21.810 --> 00:13:23.810
It's to have your LEGO set.

00:13:23.810 --> 00:13:24.810
Sales.

00:13:24.810 --> 00:13:26.060
Sales used to be back--

00:13:26.060 --> 00:13:27.840
I'm kind of going to date myself
when I tell the story.

00:13:27.840 --> 00:13:30.390
But back when I was at Apple,
you used to have to sign a

00:13:30.390 --> 00:13:32.780
contract with these people
called retailers in order for

00:13:32.780 --> 00:13:34.190
them to carry your product.

00:13:34.190 --> 00:13:36.000
And your job was to figure out
how to give them enough money

00:13:36.000 --> 00:13:38.000
so they wouldn't carry anybody
else's product.

00:13:38.000 --> 00:13:40.600
And it was all this set
of monetization plays.

00:13:40.600 --> 00:13:43.690
And Evernote, as just one
example, gives away their

00:13:43.690 --> 00:13:45.350
product-- gosh, where am
I standing right now--

00:13:45.350 --> 00:13:46.690
gives away their product
knowing that

00:13:46.690 --> 00:13:48.020
enough people use them.

00:13:48.020 --> 00:13:50.510
You can monetize it in
many other ways.

00:13:50.510 --> 00:13:53.200
And then, of course, we talked
about the TED to TEDx example,

00:13:53.200 --> 00:13:56.190
which a marketing budget could
not merely do in the same way.

00:13:56.190 --> 00:13:57.120
They've created scale.

00:13:57.120 --> 00:13:58.320
And they've created
enthusiasm.

00:13:58.320 --> 00:14:00.020
And they've created
influencers.

00:14:00.020 --> 00:14:02.650
Every part of the business model
is affected when you can

00:14:02.650 --> 00:14:05.390
allow commute to actually
co-create with you.

00:14:05.390 --> 00:14:06.810
They don't work for you.

00:14:06.810 --> 00:14:08.550
You don't tell them
what to do.

00:14:08.550 --> 00:14:10.150
But this stuff happens.

00:14:10.150 --> 00:14:14.050
And in fact, when I tell this
idea to more traditional

00:14:14.050 --> 00:14:16.670
business owners, just because
I have that background, they

00:14:16.670 --> 00:14:20.375
will look at me like that's
just super scary.

00:14:20.375 --> 00:14:23.230
Is it scary for any of you?

00:14:23.230 --> 00:14:23.610
OK.

00:14:23.610 --> 00:14:24.290
Well, no.

00:14:24.290 --> 00:14:25.510
Apparently--

00:14:25.510 --> 00:14:26.576
OK, how is it scary?

00:14:26.576 --> 00:14:28.710
AUDIENCE: How do you
maintain quality?

00:14:28.710 --> 00:14:29.580
NILOFER MERCHANT: How do
you maintain quality?

00:14:29.580 --> 00:14:30.756
That's a great question.

00:14:30.756 --> 00:14:31.860
Do you have one, too?

00:14:31.860 --> 00:14:34.575
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:14:34.575 --> 00:14:37.198
where it's more like a social
mesh rather than

00:14:37.198 --> 00:14:40.300
being within the brand?

00:14:40.300 --> 00:14:42.245
NILOFER MERCHANT: Right, how
do you own the brand?

00:14:42.245 --> 00:14:43.850
That's super scary.

00:14:43.850 --> 00:14:45.800
In fact, I'm going to step away
from the slides for a

00:14:45.800 --> 00:14:47.780
second and tell you
the story of TED.

00:14:47.780 --> 00:14:53.460
So TED with its now 5,000
events, around December last

00:14:53.460 --> 00:14:57.500
year, some people in Spain
produced a TEDx.

00:14:57.500 --> 00:14:59.510
TEDx Valencia I think it was.

00:14:59.510 --> 00:15:02.250
And they had people who--

00:15:02.250 --> 00:15:04.580
I'm trying really hard not
to make fun of it--

00:15:04.580 --> 00:15:07.040
my face is going to give
it away, though.

00:15:07.040 --> 00:15:07.610
Plas--

00:15:07.610 --> 00:15:09.960
oh, god, what was the word?

00:15:09.960 --> 00:15:11.090
Plasticity.

00:15:11.090 --> 00:15:12.730
They came up with this word
that didn't mean anything.

00:15:12.730 --> 00:15:15.320
And then they had some person
who understood the psychic

00:15:15.320 --> 00:15:16.840
healing power of crystals.

00:15:16.840 --> 00:15:21.240
And they had these pretty
nonscientific people

00:15:21.240 --> 00:15:24.680
positioning all their stuff
as scientific stuff.

00:15:24.680 --> 00:15:27.480
And somebody ended up writing
a post who witnessed it and

00:15:27.480 --> 00:15:29.710
said this was an offense
on so many levels.

00:15:29.710 --> 00:15:31.120
Like it was an offense
to science.

00:15:31.120 --> 00:15:33.100
It was an offense to the people
who had to witness it.

00:15:33.100 --> 00:15:34.060
It was an offense to TED.

00:15:34.060 --> 00:15:36.010
It was just an offense to-- oh,
and I think the last line

00:15:36.010 --> 00:15:37.980
was, and to common sense
because it was just--

00:15:37.980 --> 00:15:40.180
it was ridiculous.

00:15:40.180 --> 00:15:44.410
So here many, many miles away
happening in a different

00:15:44.410 --> 00:15:49.750
language and somebody on
Reddit ends up posting,

00:15:49.750 --> 00:15:52.340
originally in the Spanish
thing, and posting it on

00:15:52.340 --> 00:15:57.320
Reddit saying, TEDs name is
being dragged through the mud.

00:15:57.320 --> 00:15:59.860
5,000 people comment on it.

00:15:59.860 --> 00:16:02.860
Within 24 hours, it goes all
over Twitter and all the

00:16:02.860 --> 00:16:05.160
logical places.

00:16:05.160 --> 00:16:07.320
And TED starts stepping
into the fray.

00:16:07.320 --> 00:16:10.710
And first they say, people
are allowed to

00:16:10.710 --> 00:16:12.800
have their own stuff.

00:16:12.800 --> 00:16:13.750
And that sometimes happens.

00:16:13.750 --> 00:16:16.040
We'll manage it later
and yada yada.

00:16:16.040 --> 00:16:19.070
And then what happens in this
dialogue, though, because it's

00:16:19.070 --> 00:16:21.820
not just a one way thing is
they use it to learn.

00:16:21.820 --> 00:16:23.120
And somebody says,
you know what?

00:16:23.120 --> 00:16:26.350
You're not giving your people
enough guidance as to how to

00:16:26.350 --> 00:16:27.850
pick speakers.

00:16:27.850 --> 00:16:30.320
And so a bunch of your content
is pseudoscience crap.

00:16:30.320 --> 00:16:32.100
In fact, there's one
that's beautiful.

00:16:32.100 --> 00:16:34.580
If you go on Quora, and
there's somebody who's

00:16:34.580 --> 00:16:37.290
actually posted a TED talk and
says, how long can you get

00:16:37.290 --> 00:16:39.150
through this talk without
wanting to throw up?

00:16:39.150 --> 00:16:43.230
And it's a physicist over at
Stanford that says not long

00:16:43.230 --> 00:16:45.370
and just debunks the talk.

00:16:45.370 --> 00:16:49.140
That talk has since
been removed.

00:16:49.140 --> 00:16:52.750
The thing that TED had to do was
to step into the dialogue

00:16:52.750 --> 00:16:54.970
and figure out what is
it they could learn.

00:16:54.970 --> 00:16:57.070
And then, they actually ended
up posting a multi-page kind

00:16:57.070 --> 00:16:57.480
of process.

00:16:57.480 --> 00:16:59.890
Like people, we gotta
fix this.

00:16:59.890 --> 00:17:01.740
And this is not our
problem, TED.

00:17:01.740 --> 00:17:05.180
This is our problem, TED.

00:17:05.180 --> 00:17:06.785
And they actually asked
the community to

00:17:06.785 --> 00:17:08.010
step into the framework.

00:17:08.010 --> 00:17:09.910
Like step up how much
you're curating.

00:17:09.910 --> 00:17:11.640
Step up how you're doing it.

00:17:11.640 --> 00:17:14.950
And so, certainly, there's a
risk in all of that stuff

00:17:14.950 --> 00:17:15.819
that's happened.

00:17:15.819 --> 00:17:20.589
But what they actually said
is openness wins overall.

00:17:20.589 --> 00:17:22.990
As much as we make these people
part of our co-creative

00:17:22.990 --> 00:17:25.280
process, they are also
part of the solution.

00:17:25.280 --> 00:17:26.710
So in the problem
is a solution.

00:17:26.710 --> 00:17:29.030
And they ended up posting a
whole series of things and

00:17:29.030 --> 00:17:30.830
working through that.

00:17:30.830 --> 00:17:32.930
And I think it's just terrifying
for anyone who owns

00:17:32.930 --> 00:17:35.900
a brand because your brand can
be drug through the mud.

00:17:35.900 --> 00:17:38.970
And of course, there's a whole
control issue about how do you

00:17:38.970 --> 00:17:40.100
manage quality.

00:17:40.100 --> 00:17:42.780
And in TED's case, one of the
ways they manage quality is to

00:17:42.780 --> 00:17:44.500
say, this section
of it is free.

00:17:44.500 --> 00:17:46.440
1,000 flowers bloom.

00:17:46.440 --> 00:17:49.980
And this section we highly
curate, TED.com.

00:17:49.980 --> 00:17:51.660
And so how do you allow--

00:17:51.660 --> 00:17:53.570
because the brand is so
indistinct to some people.

00:17:53.570 --> 00:17:55.690
How do you do both and
make sure you're

00:17:55.690 --> 00:17:57.190
managing your quality?

00:17:57.190 --> 00:17:59.715
So I hope I answered both
those two concerns.

00:17:59.715 --> 00:18:01.860
But I think it's scary on
multiple levels than just the

00:18:01.860 --> 00:18:04.350
ones that you've mentioned.

00:18:04.350 --> 00:18:09.430
It's when you're leading
a leaderless context,

00:18:09.430 --> 00:18:10.680
how do you do that?

00:18:12.910 --> 00:18:16.230
And if you went to business
school like I did, the way

00:18:16.230 --> 00:18:18.730
we're taught leadership
is you're in charge.

00:18:18.730 --> 00:18:22.080
And it's about how much you're
leading people or resources.

00:18:22.080 --> 00:18:25.850
And power comes from leading
people or resources, not about

00:18:25.850 --> 00:18:27.690
whether or not you're
leading an idea.

00:18:27.690 --> 00:18:29.880
And that's the fundamental shift
here that we're talking

00:18:29.880 --> 00:18:35.210
about is TED's leading an idea
and so are a whole bunch of

00:18:35.210 --> 00:18:35.830
other organizations.

00:18:35.830 --> 00:18:36.820
There's a question.

00:18:36.820 --> 00:18:38.120
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

00:18:38.120 --> 00:18:39.756
TED is obviously a
great example.

00:18:39.756 --> 00:18:44.208
But the reason why people want
to help TED is because TED is

00:18:44.208 --> 00:18:44.994
a very strong brand.

00:18:44.994 --> 00:18:45.485
NILOFER MERCHANT: Yes.

00:18:45.485 --> 00:18:46.960
As [INAUDIBLE].

00:18:46.960 --> 00:18:50.228
AUDIENCE: However, if I'm
starting TED, I don't think I

00:18:50.228 --> 00:18:52.190
would get the same following.

00:18:52.190 --> 00:18:57.100
It really has to do, once you're
already a success,

00:18:57.100 --> 00:19:00.384
people wouldn't [INAUDIBLE] time
into helping [INAUDIBLE].

00:19:00.384 --> 00:19:03.310
Also because in their own self
interest that they want to

00:19:03.310 --> 00:19:04.340
become part of that success.

00:19:04.340 --> 00:19:05.850
NILOFER MERCHANT: So you're
raising a really good point,

00:19:05.850 --> 00:19:07.980
which is how do you get people
to run with you.

00:19:07.980 --> 00:19:11.260
And so in TED's case, they had
enough of a magnetic pull.

00:19:11.260 --> 00:19:13.790
But in other cases, it's
figuring out how do you have

00:19:13.790 --> 00:19:15.490
shared interests.

00:19:15.490 --> 00:19:17.920
So in TED's case, they're
actually doing this thing

00:19:17.920 --> 00:19:21.800
where people who want to bring
ideas to market use the master

00:19:21.800 --> 00:19:24.310
brand of TED and are able to
invest literally hundreds of

00:19:24.310 --> 00:19:25.570
hours in order to do that.

00:19:25.570 --> 00:19:28.070
The question is why are all
those people doing it?

00:19:28.070 --> 00:19:30.500
And how do you really
tap into that?

00:19:30.500 --> 00:19:32.030
Kickstarter has started--

00:19:32.030 --> 00:19:33.200
it's only three years old.

00:19:33.200 --> 00:19:34.500
It's kind of hard to imagine
that because it's had such a

00:19:34.500 --> 00:19:35.510
profound effect.

00:19:35.510 --> 00:19:38.760
But what it's tapping into is
this desire that's beyond

00:19:38.760 --> 00:19:41.440
money, about how can I commit
to certain things?

00:19:41.440 --> 00:19:43.500
And what is this shared product
I might want to bring

00:19:43.500 --> 00:19:45.700
into this market or this shared
purpose I might have

00:19:45.700 --> 00:19:46.970
with someone?

00:19:46.970 --> 00:19:49.050
And that starts to create
the magnet.

00:19:49.050 --> 00:19:51.200
And so instead of thinking
about how do I tell other

00:19:51.200 --> 00:19:54.640
people, it's what's that
magnetic force of purpose?

00:19:54.640 --> 00:19:59.950
And how do I get it to be so
darn strong that they'll come?

00:19:59.950 --> 00:20:01.740
And once you tap into that,
you start tapping into a

00:20:01.740 --> 00:20:04.030
different source, a
creative source.

00:20:04.030 --> 00:20:05.530
It causes people to run
with you using the

00:20:05.530 --> 00:20:07.570
visual behind me.

00:20:07.570 --> 00:20:11.100
And that's what I'm trying to
talk to you is the shift used

00:20:11.100 --> 00:20:12.780
to be that you used
to do stuff by

00:20:12.780 --> 00:20:16.400
yourself, alone, apart.

00:20:16.400 --> 00:20:20.870
And power came from the value
chain kind of process of being

00:20:20.870 --> 00:20:22.260
distinctly apart.

00:20:22.260 --> 00:20:25.020
And then the other one is about
community, which is how

00:20:25.020 --> 00:20:27.880
do I get a bunch of people
to start working in

00:20:27.880 --> 00:20:29.130
collaboration?

00:20:29.130 --> 00:20:31.450
And that shifts scale.

00:20:31.450 --> 00:20:34.380
But it also means that from a
marketing perspective, you're

00:20:34.380 --> 00:20:35.660
no longer just talking
about a product.

00:20:35.660 --> 00:20:37.180
So just take 20 years ago.

00:20:37.180 --> 00:20:38.690
We take it for granted today.

00:20:38.690 --> 00:20:41.310
But 20 years ago, the power of
being able to sell a product

00:20:41.310 --> 00:20:43.640
was how big a megaphone
you could have.

00:20:43.640 --> 00:20:46.240
And that share of voice, as it
was called in the marketplace,

00:20:46.240 --> 00:20:48.750
allowed you to dominate how much
you could then exclude

00:20:48.750 --> 00:20:50.290
other people.

00:20:50.290 --> 00:20:51.450
That's not really--

00:20:51.450 --> 00:20:52.660
not the case anymore.

00:20:52.660 --> 00:20:56.350
So what causes people to then be
pulled into the story with

00:20:56.350 --> 00:20:59.500
you is about purpose
and who can join

00:20:59.500 --> 00:21:01.950
with you in that endeavor.

00:21:01.950 --> 00:21:04.130
In the TED example, it's really
easy to see the shared

00:21:04.130 --> 00:21:07.330
purpose is you get to create
content and ideas that matter.

00:21:07.330 --> 00:21:08.750
But what is the shared
purpose--

00:21:08.750 --> 00:21:10.380
let's take Google+.

00:21:10.380 --> 00:21:13.250
Why does someone invest
in Google+

00:21:13.250 --> 00:21:16.210
versus, let's say, Facebook?

00:21:16.210 --> 00:21:18.310
Anybody have a take on that?

00:21:18.310 --> 00:21:20.360
AUDIENCE: I'd say one that I
hear a lot from our users is

00:21:20.360 --> 00:21:23.060
that there's a level of
authenticity, that they can be

00:21:23.060 --> 00:21:25.630
contextual, that they can--
instead of putting on a

00:21:25.630 --> 00:21:28.840
persona and sort of status
casting the glamour of their

00:21:28.840 --> 00:21:32.110
life, they can have authentic
meaningful conversations in

00:21:32.110 --> 00:21:35.880
the safe context of the people
that they actually want to

00:21:35.880 --> 00:21:37.420
talk to for a given topic.

00:21:37.420 --> 00:21:39.140
NILOFER MERCHANT: So the circles
kind of construct

00:21:39.140 --> 00:21:41.490
allows you to actually say,
here's who I want to talk to

00:21:41.490 --> 00:21:42.360
about this thing.

00:21:42.360 --> 00:21:42.730
AUDIENCE: Right.

00:21:42.730 --> 00:21:43.960
NILOFER MERCHANT: So it
creates more meaning.

00:21:43.960 --> 00:21:45.060
AUDIENCE: Yes.

00:21:45.060 --> 00:21:45.580
NILOFER MERCHANT: Yeah.

00:21:45.580 --> 00:21:48.840
So meaning, instead of just
broad, is what creates a

00:21:48.840 --> 00:21:49.220
difference.

00:21:49.220 --> 00:21:51.280
Any other thoughts on why
someone would choose Google+

00:21:51.280 --> 00:21:52.276
over Facebook?

00:21:52.276 --> 00:21:56.580
Why would someone go spend the
time, energy, time shifting

00:21:56.580 --> 00:21:57.920
their protocols from Facebook?

00:21:57.920 --> 00:21:59.880
And I just think it's
more dominant today.

00:21:59.880 --> 00:22:02.440
So I'll just use that as
the example to Google+.

00:22:02.440 --> 00:22:04.080
AUDIENCE: When you want to have
a personal persona, you

00:22:04.080 --> 00:22:05.320
might want to use Facebook.

00:22:05.320 --> 00:22:07.640
But I have a professional
persona--

00:22:07.640 --> 00:22:09.780
so I don't think it's
an either or.

00:22:09.780 --> 00:22:15.050
So I use Google+ as sort of
my professional persona.

00:22:15.050 --> 00:22:17.940
And Facebook is where all
my aunts and uncles are.

00:22:17.940 --> 00:22:20.450
NILOFER MERCHANT: Or your old
high school buddies, which I'm

00:22:20.450 --> 00:22:22.360
sort of amazed that all these
high school buddies exist

00:22:22.360 --> 00:22:23.980
because they didn't talk
to me in high school.

00:22:23.980 --> 00:22:25.780
I don't understand why
they talk to me now.

00:22:25.780 --> 00:22:29.800
If you help me manage my
presence more, then all of a

00:22:29.800 --> 00:22:32.190
sudden, I have more
vested interest.

00:22:32.190 --> 00:22:35.330
I think the circles thing is
profound in terms of how I

00:22:35.330 --> 00:22:36.940
manage what I want to share.

00:22:36.940 --> 00:22:42.030
So I am a grandma in addition to
being an author in addition

00:22:42.030 --> 00:22:44.400
to I have a ton of questions
of things that sometimes I

00:22:44.400 --> 00:22:45.890
don't really want to ask to
a really broad group.

00:22:45.890 --> 00:22:47.530
I just want to ask to a really
small group because I'm

00:22:47.530 --> 00:22:49.370
actually testing an idea.

00:22:49.370 --> 00:22:51.750
And I want to see just
how crazy it is.

00:22:51.750 --> 00:22:53.230
And I don't want to necessarily
broadcast it.

00:22:53.230 --> 00:22:56.340
Sometimes I'm just really
testing an early idea.

00:22:56.340 --> 00:22:59.110
So there's this other level
of communication that I'm

00:22:59.110 --> 00:23:01.720
managing, which Facebook doesn't
allow me to manage.

00:23:01.720 --> 00:23:03.810
And I could do something like
what you're suggesting, which

00:23:03.810 --> 00:23:06.140
is I can use Facebook
for one thing and

00:23:06.140 --> 00:23:07.560
Twitter for another thing.

00:23:07.560 --> 00:23:10.690
But I think what's happening
is attention, which is the

00:23:10.690 --> 00:23:14.740
currency of the social era,
is being depleted.

00:23:14.740 --> 00:23:17.920
And as long as I'm doing
literally LinkedIn--

00:23:17.920 --> 00:23:19.700
don't forget those guys--

00:23:19.700 --> 00:23:22.340
LinkedIn, Facebook,
Twitter, Google+.

00:23:22.340 --> 00:23:23.665
Oh my god, I could
spend a day.

00:23:26.530 --> 00:23:28.710
And so I think there's something
there about what is

00:23:28.710 --> 00:23:30.010
the purpose?

00:23:30.010 --> 00:23:31.830
And I think as all this
attention continues to get

00:23:31.830 --> 00:23:34.170
diverged, I think the
opportunity to come back

00:23:34.170 --> 00:23:37.170
together and manage in one spot
is going to become more

00:23:37.170 --> 00:23:37.750
interesting.

00:23:37.750 --> 00:23:40.050
So I think that's going to
become especially interesting

00:23:40.050 --> 00:23:41.940
to those of us that
are deluged.

00:23:41.940 --> 00:23:45.140
And we'll be the ones who will
go to a new platform.

00:23:45.140 --> 00:23:46.810
So that's just a thesis
that I have.

00:23:46.810 --> 00:23:47.480
I could be completely wrong.

00:23:47.480 --> 00:23:49.090
That's one of my early thesis.

00:23:49.090 --> 00:23:51.690
But what I'm saying is if you
can figure out what's that

00:23:51.690 --> 00:23:54.430
purpose of what problem could
you solve for someone like me

00:23:54.430 --> 00:23:57.930
who is pretty active online, you
might actually be able to

00:23:57.930 --> 00:24:01.170
also create a domino effect
for other people.

00:24:01.170 --> 00:24:03.470
And it's when you start thinking
about that, you start

00:24:03.470 --> 00:24:05.770
to change how you think
about messaging.

00:24:05.770 --> 00:24:08.160
It's tying back to what is
the fundamental need?

00:24:08.160 --> 00:24:11.740
And I know that's probably
incredibly obvious to this

00:24:11.740 --> 00:24:14.470
audience, and I'm just pointing
out that it's not

00:24:14.470 --> 00:24:16.820
obvious to a lot marketeers.

00:24:16.820 --> 00:24:20.340
That we think first about what
is the product I have, and how

00:24:20.340 --> 00:24:22.720
do I blast it out?

00:24:22.720 --> 00:24:24.960
I still am kind of amazed at how
many press releases still

00:24:24.960 --> 00:24:26.950
manage to come in my inbox even
though I keep tagging it

00:24:26.950 --> 00:24:29.590
as spam because I'm like
really, people.

00:24:29.590 --> 00:24:32.240
If it's important, I'll find
out about it on my own.

00:24:32.240 --> 00:24:32.815
Don't tell me.

00:24:32.815 --> 00:24:34.250
I don't want to know from you.

00:24:34.250 --> 00:24:36.770
I want to know from a
different context.

00:24:36.770 --> 00:24:39.440
So those two shifts though
change the business model

00:24:39.440 --> 00:24:40.720
piece, which is how
we started.

00:24:40.720 --> 00:24:43.910
So we said that 800 pound
gorilla that had power by

00:24:43.910 --> 00:24:46.060
having power over other people,
by having a bunch of

00:24:46.060 --> 00:24:49.330
people work for them, by locking
up capital, by locking

00:24:49.330 --> 00:24:52.230
up resources, by having more
capital to be able to shout

00:24:52.230 --> 00:24:55.230
that megaphone to the world,
that guy's been sitting around

00:24:55.230 --> 00:24:56.760
thinking about-- guy, sorry.

00:24:56.760 --> 00:24:58.450
But it is--

00:24:58.450 --> 00:25:02.260
has been thinking about the diet
like how do I get myself

00:25:02.260 --> 00:25:04.100
to just act leaner.

00:25:04.100 --> 00:25:07.130
And he should be thinking
about how do I act more

00:25:07.130 --> 00:25:10.190
gazelle like because the
architecture that they've been

00:25:10.190 --> 00:25:11.870
using is I make a
lot of stuff.

00:25:11.870 --> 00:25:12.940
And I sell a lot of it.

00:25:12.940 --> 00:25:14.770
And that's how I get
to have scale.

00:25:14.770 --> 00:25:16.490
That's how I become
successful.

00:25:16.490 --> 00:25:20.280
That is an architecture of 1970
of a company Purina dog

00:25:20.280 --> 00:25:21.850
chow might include.

00:25:21.850 --> 00:25:23.355
Sorry, that's a personal
reference he said to

00:25:23.355 --> 00:25:24.750
me a long time ago.

00:25:24.750 --> 00:25:28.280
And those gorilla constructs
are no longer valid.

00:25:28.280 --> 00:25:30.530
But that is largely the
constructs that are taught in

00:25:30.530 --> 00:25:32.390
business school today.

00:25:32.390 --> 00:25:36.160
And they are essentially
eliminating or not seeing this

00:25:36.160 --> 00:25:36.920
other set of apertures.

00:25:36.920 --> 00:25:39.350
So I just want to expand the
framework of how we might

00:25:39.350 --> 00:25:41.620
think about business models
in the future.

00:25:41.620 --> 00:25:44.460
The first is thinking about
scale not as an axis about

00:25:44.460 --> 00:25:47.510
just the stuff I do alone and
separate but the stuff I do

00:25:47.510 --> 00:25:49.680
with others.

00:25:49.680 --> 00:25:51.970
That is so fundamental
a tectonic shift.

00:25:51.970 --> 00:25:53.940
And this group might take
it for granted.

00:25:53.940 --> 00:25:55.060
But the broader world
does not.

00:25:55.060 --> 00:25:57.420
And business models don't
play to that.

00:25:57.420 --> 00:25:59.230
And the second is to think
about not just what we

00:25:59.230 --> 00:26:02.290
produce, but what is the way
in which we engage other

00:26:02.290 --> 00:26:04.140
people in that purpose because
that changes things.

00:26:04.140 --> 00:26:06.543
And just to kind of make it a
little bit more real, I'm

00:26:06.543 --> 00:26:09.710
going to overlay the examples.

00:26:09.710 --> 00:26:12.750
So of course, the quadrants
start to create meaning.

00:26:12.750 --> 00:26:16.050
One has more about meaning,
one about communities, one

00:26:16.050 --> 00:26:17.080
about co-creation.

00:26:17.080 --> 00:26:19.450
But as you see the examples,
you can start to see

00:26:19.450 --> 00:26:21.090
how that plays out.

00:26:21.090 --> 00:26:22.350
Zipcar.

00:26:22.350 --> 00:26:23.640
Avis did not create Zipcar.

00:26:23.640 --> 00:26:26.460
Avis had to buy Zipcar.

00:26:26.460 --> 00:26:27.100
Why?

00:26:27.100 --> 00:26:30.810
Because they consider that
idea about sharing,

00:26:30.810 --> 00:26:31.590
stewardship--

00:26:31.590 --> 00:26:32.550
ugh.

00:26:32.550 --> 00:26:33.950
Like that just wouldn't
occur to them.

00:26:33.950 --> 00:26:35.580
It wasn't part of their
business model.

00:26:35.580 --> 00:26:38.140
How do we make money as Avis.

00:26:38.140 --> 00:26:40.280
Three years ago it was about
I have enough cars.

00:26:40.280 --> 00:26:42.370
I have a fleet of
cars and assets.

00:26:42.370 --> 00:26:44.390
And I have enough scale.

00:26:44.390 --> 00:26:47.520
So I can reach all the spots
in which you need the cars.

00:26:47.520 --> 00:26:49.600
So the idea of this
decentralized kind of

00:26:49.600 --> 00:26:53.290
construct or actually not owning
a resource in the same

00:26:53.290 --> 00:26:58.700
way having importance
dismissed it.

00:26:58.700 --> 00:27:00.650
In fact, it's kind of easier to
see this example when I do

00:27:00.650 --> 00:27:03.170
the banking one.

00:27:03.170 --> 00:27:08.620
So Bank of America for years
missed the opportunity to

00:27:08.620 --> 00:27:10.810
actually do any kind of
microlending, which is what

00:27:10.810 --> 00:27:13.020
Kiva really created six,
seven years ago.

00:27:13.020 --> 00:27:16.910
Microlending, which allows me
to give $25 but that $25

00:27:16.910 --> 00:27:19.430
largely to be circulated an
improve the economy in

00:27:19.430 --> 00:27:21.130
developing areas.

00:27:21.130 --> 00:27:26.140
They actually spent $2 million
funding a company called

00:27:26.140 --> 00:27:28.955
ProFounder, which allowed
someone like me--

00:27:28.955 --> 00:27:31.050
if you were a local dry cleaner
and I wanted to help

00:27:31.050 --> 00:27:32.800
you go green, I could
invest in it but

00:27:32.800 --> 00:27:34.590
actually get paid back.

00:27:34.590 --> 00:27:37.460
So in a traditional world of
lawyers, it costs over

00:27:37.460 --> 00:27:39.880
$100,000 for that transaction
to happen.

00:27:39.880 --> 00:27:42.750
And ProFounder found a way
to do it for $1,000.

00:27:42.750 --> 00:27:44.540
Pretty incredible
business model.

00:27:44.540 --> 00:27:46.450
Allows capital to come
from many sources.

00:27:46.450 --> 00:27:47.790
Allows it to be paid back.

00:27:47.790 --> 00:27:49.840
So instead of buying ProFounder,
they spent $2

00:27:49.840 --> 00:27:52.710
million and several years of
legislation putting ProFounder

00:27:52.710 --> 00:27:55.110
out of business.

00:27:55.110 --> 00:27:56.080
Yeah.

00:27:56.080 --> 00:27:57.890
I was one of the early investors
in ProFounder just

00:27:57.890 --> 00:27:59.560
so I'm being full disclosure.

00:27:59.560 --> 00:28:01.380
But the reason I really thought
they were important is

00:28:01.380 --> 00:28:04.080
because I thought they let a
different kind of community

00:28:04.080 --> 00:28:06.070
construct really
come into play.

00:28:06.070 --> 00:28:08.930
And then of course, they skip
things like PayPal and Square

00:28:08.930 --> 00:28:10.440
because they're like, yeah,
yeah, those little small

00:28:10.440 --> 00:28:13.320
merchants, they're too small
for us to care about.

00:28:13.320 --> 00:28:15.230
And we're going to charge
them more because

00:28:15.230 --> 00:28:16.410
they're more high risk.

00:28:16.410 --> 00:28:19.350
And yet, anyone who's gone to a
hairdresser and who's done a

00:28:19.350 --> 00:28:22.140
Square exchange, I have more
community with that Square

00:28:22.140 --> 00:28:26.380
exchange person than I do that
merchant at Lunardi's.

00:28:26.380 --> 00:28:27.410
It changes the relationship.

00:28:27.410 --> 00:28:29.890
They're actually less risky
because we know each other.

00:28:29.890 --> 00:28:34.130
We're going to be in the same
park together later that day.

00:28:34.130 --> 00:28:36.910
The banking industry, like any
big industry, has basically

00:28:36.910 --> 00:28:38.870
been saying, yeah, yeah,
those other quadrants?

00:28:38.870 --> 00:28:39.780
Yeah, yeah, they don't matter.

00:28:39.780 --> 00:28:40.240
Community?

00:28:40.240 --> 00:28:41.340
No, no.

00:28:41.340 --> 00:28:43.740
So they're actually really
struggling with this.

00:28:43.740 --> 00:28:46.236
But until we understand business
models that apply to

00:28:46.236 --> 00:28:48.930
all four constructs, we will
not expand our universe.

00:28:48.930 --> 00:28:51.320
We will not expand how value
creation actually happens.

00:28:54.700 --> 00:28:56.600
I just want to double click down
on this notion of purpose

00:28:56.600 --> 00:28:59.490
because sometimes I do
a talk like this.

00:28:59.490 --> 00:29:01.160
People nod their head
around purpose.

00:29:01.160 --> 00:29:03.580
And then we walk out of the
room, and it turns out we're

00:29:03.580 --> 00:29:04.590
not defining it the same way.

00:29:04.590 --> 00:29:06.380
So I'm just going to
take five minutes.

00:29:06.380 --> 00:29:08.600
And then I'm going to open
up for questions on that.

00:29:08.600 --> 00:29:11.440
Purpose is really
about the why.

00:29:11.440 --> 00:29:12.730
But I'll give you a couple
of examples.

00:29:12.730 --> 00:29:15.590
So how many of you guys have
gone to Sports Authority?

00:29:15.590 --> 00:29:17.400
Notice that no one in there
actually does sports?

00:29:20.830 --> 00:29:22.210
Noticed?

00:29:22.210 --> 00:29:26.020
And so usually that gets a big
laugh, so I'm curious?

00:29:26.020 --> 00:29:28.270
You guys actually think
they know sports?

00:29:28.270 --> 00:29:31.210
So in Sports Authority, they
hire a cashier person.

00:29:31.210 --> 00:29:35.560
Or they hire someone to do
stocking, or someone to--

00:29:35.560 --> 00:29:37.080
but people don't actually
love the sports.

00:29:37.080 --> 00:29:40.740
But in comparison, when
you go to REI, people

00:29:40.740 --> 00:29:42.630
actually love the sport.

00:29:42.630 --> 00:29:45.530
And they will literally walk you
over from a backpack area

00:29:45.530 --> 00:29:47.640
to the map area and say, where
are you thinking about going?

00:29:47.640 --> 00:29:48.810
Let's make sure you
get the right map.

00:29:48.810 --> 00:29:50.970
And by the way, instead of
buying that product because

00:29:50.970 --> 00:29:53.010
that's kind of expensive, if
this is your first time out,

00:29:53.010 --> 00:29:55.040
you might want to rent it
because it's a lot cheaper.

00:29:55.040 --> 00:29:58.610
They will actually get you
enthusiastic about sports.

00:29:58.610 --> 00:30:01.120
Difference between Sports
Authority and REI.

00:30:06.380 --> 00:30:06.680
OK.

00:30:06.680 --> 00:30:08.270
So apparently that build
wasn't going to build.

00:30:08.270 --> 00:30:10.510
But the difference
is about purpose.

00:30:10.510 --> 00:30:14.180
So when you're REI, you're
actually hiring talent based

00:30:14.180 --> 00:30:17.600
on that purpose, that passion
that that person brings in to

00:30:17.600 --> 00:30:18.720
the organization.

00:30:18.720 --> 00:30:21.090
And that's what allows them to
show up fully alive at work

00:30:21.090 --> 00:30:23.450
and engage with consumers
the way they do.

00:30:23.450 --> 00:30:25.660
So it's a way for us to actually
think about who do we

00:30:25.660 --> 00:30:27.720
put on our team.

00:30:27.720 --> 00:30:29.000
RIM to Apple.

00:30:29.000 --> 00:30:31.950
So RIM many years ago and then,
of course, you guys

00:30:31.950 --> 00:30:33.310
extend the story.

00:30:33.310 --> 00:30:35.220
And to other audiences, by
the way, I talk about

00:30:35.220 --> 00:30:35.830
Google quite a bit.

00:30:35.830 --> 00:30:38.500
So I'm just avoiding
doing it here.

00:30:38.500 --> 00:30:40.440
Why would you tell the same
story to a group that

00:30:40.440 --> 00:30:41.330
already knows it.

00:30:41.330 --> 00:30:44.950
RIM, three, four years ago
focused on creating the

00:30:44.950 --> 00:30:47.210
developer app and actually
picked--

00:30:47.210 --> 00:30:49.130
they felt like their
job was to pick--

00:30:49.130 --> 00:30:51.850
what was the application that
should be on the device.

00:30:51.850 --> 00:30:53.690
And then Apple came along and
said, gosh, that's costing

00:30:53.690 --> 00:30:54.520
first of all a lot of money.

00:30:54.520 --> 00:30:56.870
And why should we be
the ones to pick?

00:30:56.870 --> 00:30:58.980
And they just figured out how to
change the fundamental cost

00:30:58.980 --> 00:31:02.610
system of developing an app from
a $1 million to $10,000.

00:31:02.610 --> 00:31:05.330
Google came along and
did it to $1,000.

00:31:05.330 --> 00:31:06.890
1,000 flowers blooming.

00:31:06.890 --> 00:31:08.440
Why should we pick?

00:31:08.440 --> 00:31:10.130
And that open model--

00:31:10.130 --> 00:31:12.570
RIM is certainly closed,
Apple is semi open,

00:31:12.570 --> 00:31:13.950
Google fully open.

00:31:13.950 --> 00:31:17.270
Google now has 50% of market
share of the mobile space in

00:31:17.270 --> 00:31:19.410
less than three years.

00:31:19.410 --> 00:31:23.960
Apple earns only 4% of its
sales from the app store.

00:31:23.960 --> 00:31:26.730
But of course, what would be
Apple without the app store?

00:31:26.730 --> 00:31:28.655
And of course, RIM-- you
know the demise of RIM.

00:31:28.655 --> 00:31:30.940
So that story kind of
plays itself out.

00:31:30.940 --> 00:31:34.380
Purpose then lets somebody own
that device and really think

00:31:34.380 --> 00:31:36.470
about it as their device.

00:31:36.470 --> 00:31:38.350
So the silly things I might do
with mine is going to be

00:31:38.350 --> 00:31:40.410
different than the thing you
would do with yours and how we

00:31:40.410 --> 00:31:41.990
all geek out on our
own device.

00:31:41.990 --> 00:31:45.090
It personalizes it both in terms
of what we produce and

00:31:45.090 --> 00:31:47.520
then how we actually
consume content.

00:31:47.520 --> 00:31:49.550
And of course, it shows
up in the ways

00:31:49.550 --> 00:31:50.690
we think about products.

00:31:50.690 --> 00:31:58.040
Years ago, my husband drove home
with a white Prius, and I

00:31:58.040 --> 00:32:00.130
had no idea he was going to
buy a Prius that day.

00:32:00.130 --> 00:32:01.540
But he showed up at home,
and I'm like OK.

00:32:01.540 --> 00:32:02.260
I'm like why?

00:32:02.260 --> 00:32:03.853
That's not a car.

00:32:03.853 --> 00:32:04.820
That is not a car.

00:32:04.820 --> 00:32:06.670
That is a transportation pod.

00:32:06.670 --> 00:32:08.440
And so I was sort of like
why would you do that?

00:32:08.440 --> 00:32:10.730
Why would you trade a perfectly
nice BMW in for like

00:32:10.730 --> 00:32:13.250
a thing that's not even
fun to drive?

00:32:13.250 --> 00:32:16.140
And the thing that I didn't get
at the time was how much

00:32:16.140 --> 00:32:20.160
my husband valued the earth
more than he valued a car.

00:32:20.160 --> 00:32:22.160
But if you would have gone to
General Motors or any major

00:32:22.160 --> 00:32:23.230
company, they would have
thought about a

00:32:23.230 --> 00:32:24.450
car as having more--

00:32:24.450 --> 00:32:28.680
the best car in the world having
better luxury seats, or

00:32:28.680 --> 00:32:31.690
better heat, better stability
on the road.

00:32:31.690 --> 00:32:33.340
And they would have kept
building a bigger and bigger

00:32:33.340 --> 00:32:35.980
car, which explains
the SUV market.

00:32:35.980 --> 00:32:37.070
Luxury.

00:32:37.070 --> 00:32:39.820
But what they didn't account for
is the set of values that

00:32:39.820 --> 00:32:42.180
someone can hold that actually
allows them to take trade offs

00:32:42.180 --> 00:32:43.130
in the marketplace.

00:32:43.130 --> 00:32:45.780
So for them, the optimal car is
not the most luxurious car.

00:32:45.780 --> 00:32:47.670
The optimal car is the car
that is best on the

00:32:47.670 --> 00:32:49.470
earth set of values.

00:32:49.470 --> 00:32:51.930
GM actually caught onto that
just about recently.

00:32:51.930 --> 00:32:54.030
But it's because they didn't
see outside their world.

00:32:54.030 --> 00:32:55.820
They didn't have a shared
purpose with the consumer.

00:32:55.820 --> 00:32:58.030
It was them making a product
and selling it out.

00:32:58.030 --> 00:33:00.000
So as soon as you step into
this shared space, the

00:33:00.000 --> 00:33:03.170
comments outside the perimeter
of your walls, you start

00:33:03.170 --> 00:33:07.070
really creating products
quite differently.

00:33:07.070 --> 00:33:10.490
And it becomes an alignment tool
within the enterprise and

00:33:10.490 --> 00:33:11.450
external to the enterprise.

00:33:11.450 --> 00:33:13.770
How you get that herd of people
to come work with you?

00:33:13.770 --> 00:33:16.290
It's figuring out what is that
purpose that so magnetically

00:33:16.290 --> 00:33:18.660
draws them in that they're
willing to work sometimes for

00:33:18.660 --> 00:33:19.860
free in the TED case.

00:33:19.860 --> 00:33:23.570
Hundreds of hours to work for
free and to come create with

00:33:23.570 --> 00:33:26.880
you because you found something
quite appealing for

00:33:26.880 --> 00:33:29.010
them to join in on.

00:33:29.010 --> 00:33:34.880
So I'll take questions because
we have a moment I think.

00:33:34.880 --> 00:33:35.570
We have a moment?

00:33:35.570 --> 00:33:36.310
We're good?

00:33:36.310 --> 00:33:38.150
AUDIENCE: Yeah, we've
go 15 minutes.

00:33:38.150 --> 00:33:38.830
NILOFER MERCHANT: To
take questions.

00:33:38.830 --> 00:33:39.640
Yes.

00:33:39.640 --> 00:33:41.350
AUDIENCE: I'll start with
the first question.

00:33:41.350 --> 00:33:42.790
So--

00:33:42.790 --> 00:33:43.720
NILOFER MERCHANT:
He got the mic.

00:33:43.720 --> 00:33:44.990
How'd he do that?

00:33:44.990 --> 00:33:45.510
Wow.

00:33:45.510 --> 00:33:47.340
AUDIENCE: So thank you
for the presentation.

00:33:47.340 --> 00:33:49.310
That's a really cool insight.

00:33:49.310 --> 00:33:54.130
But the thing that was keeping
into my mind that it's a lot

00:33:54.130 --> 00:33:57.110
of US and Western
type of insight.

00:33:57.110 --> 00:33:59.740
So there is a billion in China,
billion in India, and

00:33:59.740 --> 00:34:04.510
another billion in the rest of
Asia, that type of a change

00:34:04.510 --> 00:34:06.890
will happen in the longer
and longer future.

00:34:06.890 --> 00:34:08.060
NILOFER MERCHANT: Of
course it will.

00:34:08.060 --> 00:34:09.350
AUDIENCE: How can we anticipate

00:34:09.350 --> 00:34:10.350
like the starter spark?

00:34:10.350 --> 00:34:14.270
How can we be ready as Google
and as individuals who might

00:34:14.270 --> 00:34:17.120
go in for startups like hey,
we're going to be the next

00:34:17.120 --> 00:34:22.090
[INAUDIBLE] of China, the next
Tesla Cars for like India and

00:34:22.090 --> 00:34:23.250
things like that.

00:34:23.250 --> 00:34:27.090
Those countries still do not
have the same problems or even

00:34:27.090 --> 00:34:31.179
care about the same things that
a US or Western type of

00:34:31.179 --> 00:34:32.810
citizen would care about?

00:34:32.810 --> 00:34:33.920
NILOFER MERCHANT: Well, I think
one of things that you

00:34:33.920 --> 00:34:36.260
guys often do, and I think I
just saw it got announced

00:34:36.260 --> 00:34:39.489
today, is you announce
opportunities for people to

00:34:39.489 --> 00:34:41.040
start creating value and
change the world

00:34:41.040 --> 00:34:41.520
in their own way.

00:34:41.520 --> 00:34:43.710
And you guys just announced
Google X--

00:34:43.710 --> 00:34:44.159
what did you call it?

00:34:44.159 --> 00:34:44.969
X vision?

00:34:44.969 --> 00:34:45.699
AUDIENCE: Solve for X.

00:34:45.699 --> 00:34:49.710
NILOFER MERCHANT: Solve
for X. Thank you.

00:34:49.710 --> 00:34:52.159
It's figuring out how to use
openness as an asset so that

00:34:52.159 --> 00:34:53.150
you're not even defining
what the

00:34:53.150 --> 00:34:54.654
problem is or the solution.

00:34:57.640 --> 00:35:00.040
And how do you build your entire
technology system so

00:35:00.040 --> 00:35:02.840
that you don't have to own the
outcome of it but allowing

00:35:02.840 --> 00:35:05.520
many, many voices to play,
bringing whatever unique

00:35:05.520 --> 00:35:08.840
perspective they have from
around the world.

00:35:08.840 --> 00:35:11.063
I told this story at lunch, but
I'll repeat it because I

00:35:11.063 --> 00:35:12.470
just think it's a great story.

00:35:12.470 --> 00:35:14.130
There was a program
called Foldit.

00:35:14.130 --> 00:35:15.450
Do you know Foldit?

00:35:15.450 --> 00:35:19.170
Protein folding crowd
sourced application.

00:35:19.170 --> 00:35:22.520
And when they first started it,
they had this very strong

00:35:22.520 --> 00:35:25.500
preconception of who would
end up contributing.

00:35:25.500 --> 00:35:27.520
And so they're fundamental
thesis was well, we're really

00:35:27.520 --> 00:35:29.080
like bright MIT people.

00:35:29.080 --> 00:35:32.070
And we'll have other people,
but from other countries,

00:35:32.070 --> 00:35:32.660
participate.

00:35:32.660 --> 00:35:34.900
So we'll get the best of India,
and the best of China

00:35:34.900 --> 00:35:36.050
to participate, and so on.

00:35:36.050 --> 00:35:38.690
But in their head, the
preconception was it's going

00:35:38.690 --> 00:35:41.570
to look a lot and feel a lot
like who they were but just in

00:35:41.570 --> 00:35:42.820
another region.

00:35:42.820 --> 00:35:45.050
And the person who ended up
becoming the best protein

00:35:45.050 --> 00:35:48.036
folder in the world, which if
you know this, you actually

00:35:48.036 --> 00:35:49.530
can accelerate science
research.

00:35:49.530 --> 00:35:51.500
So it's incredibly important.

00:35:51.500 --> 00:35:53.210
The best protein folder
in the world?

00:35:53.210 --> 00:35:54.460
Anyone know the answer?

00:35:56.880 --> 00:35:58.600
It was a woman.

00:35:58.600 --> 00:36:02.070
An admin during the day,
a nurse by training in

00:36:02.070 --> 00:36:03.830
Manchester.

00:36:03.830 --> 00:36:06.410
Sort of the opposite of what
they were thinking.

00:36:06.410 --> 00:36:08.750
But because the openness of the
architecture, instead of

00:36:08.750 --> 00:36:12.080
holding on to the outcome, the
openness of the architecture

00:36:12.080 --> 00:36:15.290
allowed a lot of difference to
show up in the system and

00:36:15.290 --> 00:36:17.770
allow the very best qualified
person to win.

00:36:17.770 --> 00:36:19.900
And that's actually, to me, the
fundamental twist in the

00:36:19.900 --> 00:36:20.680
social era.

00:36:20.680 --> 00:36:23.070
If before it was about picking,
and bedding, and

00:36:23.070 --> 00:36:25.420
choosing, and building
an empire?

00:36:25.420 --> 00:36:28.080
This is just the opposite, which
is how do I not pick?

00:36:28.080 --> 00:36:28.760
How do I not bet?

00:36:28.760 --> 00:36:31.800
How do I actually encourage
anyone anywhere to contribute?

00:36:31.800 --> 00:36:34.510
It's not that everyone will
but that anyone can.

00:36:34.510 --> 00:36:38.570
And then all of a sudden, you
open up a global economy.

00:36:38.570 --> 00:36:40.780
AUDIENCE: Very interesting
talk.

00:36:40.780 --> 00:36:44.700
It seems like the purpose area
is a problematic area in some

00:36:44.700 --> 00:36:50.750
sense in that by defining
purpose, there's, almost like

00:36:50.750 --> 00:36:54.550
marketing, you only have a
certain appetite for purpose.

00:36:54.550 --> 00:36:56.860
So how does Kellogg's cereal,
alongside toothpaste,

00:36:56.860 --> 00:36:59.630
alongside the wide kind
of [INAUDIBLE]

00:36:59.630 --> 00:37:00.120
of products.

00:37:00.120 --> 00:37:02.675
How do you establish purpose and
actually allow consumers

00:37:02.675 --> 00:37:05.680
not to become fatigued?

00:37:05.680 --> 00:37:08.200
NILOFER MERCHANT: I'm not sure
Kellogg's or a thing applies

00:37:08.200 --> 00:37:09.830
to that just so.

00:37:09.830 --> 00:37:13.730
But I think it's figuring out
what is in the commons that

00:37:13.730 --> 00:37:14.770
are unsolved problems?

00:37:14.770 --> 00:37:16.940
That's how I'm really starting
to think about purpose.

00:37:16.940 --> 00:37:18.340
So for a minute, I think people

00:37:18.340 --> 00:37:19.410
know how to get breakfast.

00:37:19.410 --> 00:37:21.720
So for a moment, I'm going
to park that sucker.

00:37:21.720 --> 00:37:24.690
Although healthy breakfast could
certainly own a category

00:37:24.690 --> 00:37:25.940
because it's hard.

00:37:28.200 --> 00:37:31.140
But it's figuring out what is
this thing in the commons

00:37:31.140 --> 00:37:34.200
that's unseen, that if I step
out there, I can start to

00:37:34.200 --> 00:37:36.050
figure out what are unsolved
things and then

00:37:36.050 --> 00:37:37.130
how do we own it.

00:37:37.130 --> 00:37:39.890
IBM did a couple years
ago when--

00:37:39.890 --> 00:37:41.280
probably one of the best
companies that's done this--

00:37:41.280 --> 00:37:43.900
is they had a--

00:37:43.900 --> 00:37:45.815
what did they call it-- a brain
jam I think is what

00:37:45.815 --> 00:37:47.760
their third term was for
it a couple years back.

00:37:47.760 --> 00:37:49.240
And they said, we know we should
be doing more in the

00:37:49.240 --> 00:37:50.390
green space.

00:37:50.390 --> 00:37:51.610
We honestly don't know what.

00:37:51.610 --> 00:37:53.110
That's exactly how
they said it.

00:37:53.110 --> 00:37:53.820
We don't know what it is.

00:37:53.820 --> 00:37:56.330
We don't know what it is
we could add value to.

00:37:56.330 --> 00:37:57.920
We don't know who we
should work with.

00:37:57.920 --> 00:38:00.320
Maybe you guys could come
help us shape that.

00:38:00.320 --> 00:38:03.910
And that has become, that
genesis, now three or four

00:38:03.910 --> 00:38:08.810
years later is contributing
about 5.5% of their gross

00:38:08.810 --> 00:38:12.510
revenue in this notion of
Smarter Planet and a series of

00:38:12.510 --> 00:38:13.590
product lines around it.

00:38:13.590 --> 00:38:15.260
But what they did is they asked
people to actually just

00:38:15.260 --> 00:38:18.550
come into the space with them
and said, anybody want to help

00:38:18.550 --> 00:38:20.820
shape how IBM does more green.

00:38:20.820 --> 00:38:23.390
So in that case, they didn't
own even what it is they

00:38:23.390 --> 00:38:26.250
should do or how they should
deliver it, but they stepped

00:38:26.250 --> 00:38:28.440
into the uncertainty
of the space.

00:38:28.440 --> 00:38:29.560
And they could have
looked like fools.

00:38:29.560 --> 00:38:31.880
They look back at that
like wow, that

00:38:31.880 --> 00:38:33.650
could have gone badly.

00:38:33.650 --> 00:38:36.560
But they just really did a
discernment process with other

00:38:36.560 --> 00:38:40.010
people, with curiosity,
inviting people to

00:38:40.010 --> 00:38:41.260
come play with them.

00:38:41.260 --> 00:38:44.450
And I think that gives us a
genesis of even just saying

00:38:44.450 --> 00:38:47.260
what is an unsolved problem, and
how you magnetically start

00:38:47.260 --> 00:38:49.530
attracting people to come help
you even define that problem,

00:38:49.530 --> 00:38:52.060
I think it's quite attractive.

00:38:52.060 --> 00:38:53.200
AUDIENCE: As you're talking
about scale,

00:38:53.200 --> 00:38:55.180
it reminds me of--

00:38:55.180 --> 00:38:57.750
so I work on the Google
Product Forum.

00:38:57.750 --> 00:39:00.470
So it's like our help forums
for Google products.

00:39:00.470 --> 00:39:03.670
And the way that we've always
thought about improving that

00:39:03.670 --> 00:39:07.300
product is how to scale it
better kind of in the same

00:39:07.300 --> 00:39:08.780
sense of what TED is doing.

00:39:08.780 --> 00:39:11.230
Like they want users to
generate the content.

00:39:11.230 --> 00:39:14.860
We want users to be our helpers
instead of having

00:39:14.860 --> 00:39:17.760
Google invest in one to one
support for our consumer

00:39:17.760 --> 00:39:20.160
products, which is
not possible.

00:39:20.160 --> 00:39:23.470
So one thing I wanted to ask
you about is how you create

00:39:23.470 --> 00:39:26.780
purpose when your product is
already set, your mission is

00:39:26.780 --> 00:39:27.770
already set.

00:39:27.770 --> 00:39:30.680
How do you create a purpose
that's beneficial to the user,

00:39:30.680 --> 00:39:35.340
also beneficial to Google out of
circumstances already kind

00:39:35.340 --> 00:39:36.420
of created for you.

00:39:36.420 --> 00:39:38.290
NILOFER MERCHANT: Why
don't you ask them?

00:39:38.290 --> 00:39:39.030
AUDIENCE: Ask the user?

00:39:39.030 --> 00:39:41.480
NILOFER MERCHANT:
Ask the user.

00:39:41.480 --> 00:39:42.450
So here's the thing.

00:39:42.450 --> 00:39:44.340
I think sometimes we want to
know the answer before we ask

00:39:44.340 --> 00:39:46.770
the question kind of thing.

00:39:46.770 --> 00:39:48.010
But in the case of Intuit--

00:39:48.010 --> 00:39:50.540
I'll just use that as another
example-- they actually opened

00:39:50.540 --> 00:39:53.360
up to their own accounting team,
all the people who use

00:39:53.360 --> 00:39:53.860
their platform.

00:39:53.860 --> 00:39:57.190
Is there any way you guys could
be more interactive that

00:39:57.190 --> 00:39:59.200
we could help with?

00:39:59.200 --> 00:40:01.500
And what it turns out is people
in Idaho really don't

00:40:01.500 --> 00:40:04.990
understand the tax rules in
California and vice versa.

00:40:04.990 --> 00:40:07.000
And they said, if you could just
let us have online form

00:40:07.000 --> 00:40:12.260
to make sure nothing illegal
happens here and manage the

00:40:12.260 --> 00:40:14.520
tension there so that crazy
stuff doesn't happen, you'd

00:40:14.520 --> 00:40:16.110
actually have created
something incredibly

00:40:16.110 --> 00:40:17.730
valuable for us.

00:40:17.730 --> 00:40:20.850
And they solved that
problem themselves.

00:40:20.850 --> 00:40:23.040
And then, the community
starts to step back.

00:40:23.040 --> 00:40:25.000
And of course, then they also
take over answering the, what

00:40:25.000 --> 00:40:26.720
I'll call, dumb questions
for a second.

00:40:26.720 --> 00:40:28.600
They also take over answering
the dumb questions because

00:40:28.600 --> 00:40:29.880
while I'm here, and I'm talking
to you about these

00:40:29.880 --> 00:40:32.370
other harder problems, I'll
give a few minutes here.

00:40:32.370 --> 00:40:36.070
The exchange starts to become
valuable because neither side

00:40:36.070 --> 00:40:37.410
is depleted.

00:40:37.410 --> 00:40:41.090
That's the very definition of
the social era is in the

00:40:41.090 --> 00:40:42.940
exchange, neither side
is depleted.

00:40:42.940 --> 00:40:46.200
So TED and TEDx both benefit.

00:40:46.200 --> 00:40:47.345
There's something in
the common that

00:40:47.345 --> 00:40:48.480
they're building together.

00:40:48.480 --> 00:40:50.590
It's not an exchange where I
pay you or you pay me, and

00:40:50.590 --> 00:40:52.540
then each one goes their own
separate ways, or I take

00:40:52.540 --> 00:40:53.630
advantage of you.

00:40:53.630 --> 00:40:55.650
The very definition of social
means you get to solve

00:40:55.650 --> 00:40:56.160
something together.

00:40:56.160 --> 00:40:58.280
So if you don't know the answer
to it, I think the

00:40:58.280 --> 00:41:00.550
answer becomes how do you
ask the question well?

00:41:00.550 --> 00:41:03.940
To say we'd love to think about
more ways for us to have

00:41:03.940 --> 00:41:06.520
more scale, for us to step back
and maybe add more value

00:41:06.520 --> 00:41:07.010
in the process.

00:41:07.010 --> 00:41:08.160
What could that be?

00:41:08.160 --> 00:41:09.870
And you may find no answers.

00:41:09.870 --> 00:41:11.270
And you might look silly
for a few minutes.

00:41:11.270 --> 00:41:13.630
But that's probably the worst
thing that's going to happen.

00:41:13.630 --> 00:41:16.710
But what might happen are
some creative answers.

00:41:16.710 --> 00:41:20.100
So it starts reformulating
the question.

00:41:20.100 --> 00:41:23.160
AUDIENCE: In the questions where
we're crowd sourcing,

00:41:23.160 --> 00:41:24.880
does it go to the
other extreme?

00:41:24.880 --> 00:41:27.990
Like you buy something from
Amazon, now they're completely

00:41:27.990 --> 00:41:32.350
peppering you for reviews on
every item that you've bought.

00:41:32.350 --> 00:41:35.690
And it's like listening
to NPR.

00:41:35.690 --> 00:41:37.730
There are those weeks where you
have to listen, even if

00:41:37.730 --> 00:41:41.670
you've contributed and
you invest in it.

00:41:41.670 --> 00:41:44.485
When does it become too much
where you're starting to crowd

00:41:44.485 --> 00:41:46.190
source, and everybody's
doing the same thing?

00:41:46.190 --> 00:41:50.060
And you're hitting the same
audience multiple times.

00:41:50.060 --> 00:41:51.030
NILOFER MERCHANT: So
this whole thing is

00:41:51.030 --> 00:41:53.690
becoming about attention.

00:41:53.690 --> 00:41:56.600
Attention is the currency
of the social era.

00:41:56.600 --> 00:41:59.590
The more you can get someone
a higher return for their

00:41:59.590 --> 00:42:03.430
currency of attention, they're
going to gravitate to you.

00:42:03.430 --> 00:42:05.490
I think Facebook, for example,
is actually coming

00:42:05.490 --> 00:42:06.710
at too high a cost.

00:42:06.710 --> 00:42:08.110
I think it's actually
at a tipping

00:42:08.110 --> 00:42:09.390
point in one direction.

00:42:09.390 --> 00:42:10.585
I think it's really
about currency.

00:42:10.585 --> 00:42:12.400
So Amazon doing that behavior
makes me want to

00:42:12.400 --> 00:42:13.870
shop less at Amazon.

00:42:13.870 --> 00:42:17.680
And I'm like one of their
big customers.

00:42:17.680 --> 00:42:19.280
I'm just really clear
about that.

00:42:19.280 --> 00:42:21.280
And they're just driving me so
nuts that I'm actually sitting

00:42:21.280 --> 00:42:23.650
here thinking, OK, now you've
made it where I no longer want

00:42:23.650 --> 00:42:25.920
to interact with you because
there's no preference setting

00:42:25.920 --> 00:42:27.890
I could do to turn that
little sucker off.

00:42:27.890 --> 00:42:29.380
They're making it possible
for someone else

00:42:29.380 --> 00:42:30.840
to enter the space.

00:42:30.840 --> 00:42:33.350
Think about what you're doing
is managing attention.

00:42:33.350 --> 00:42:34.980
And then think about in
that exchange, are

00:42:34.980 --> 00:42:36.200
you making it equal?

00:42:36.200 --> 00:42:38.250
That exchange about getting a
ping back is helping Amazon.

00:42:38.250 --> 00:42:40.030
It's not helping me.

00:42:40.030 --> 00:42:43.140
And they've now created a
cost for me to interact.

00:42:43.140 --> 00:42:44.890
They've changed the
currency exchange.

00:42:44.890 --> 00:42:47.340
So I think that becomes a really
interesting metric as

00:42:47.340 --> 00:42:51.010
we go forward, how
to look at that.

00:42:51.010 --> 00:42:51.802
Did I answer your question?

00:42:51.802 --> 00:42:52.194
OK.

00:42:52.194 --> 00:42:52.980
Thank you.

00:42:52.980 --> 00:42:56.250
AUDIENCE: So this strategy of
going to the user community,

00:42:56.250 --> 00:42:58.390
and asking for help, and
collaboratively solving

00:42:58.390 --> 00:43:01.300
problems, does that strategy
still work when the problem

00:43:01.300 --> 00:43:03.260
you're trying to solve is bad
actors in the community?

00:43:06.100 --> 00:43:07.390
NILOFER MERCHANT: So does it
solve the problem when there's

00:43:07.390 --> 00:43:07.960
bad actors?

00:43:07.960 --> 00:43:09.630
I think it does.

00:43:09.630 --> 00:43:12.750
And so I happen to have a
Harvard Magazine piece coming

00:43:12.750 --> 00:43:15.760
out on this TED debacle,
which was just brutal.

00:43:15.760 --> 00:43:17.220
I'm not sure how much-- you were
nodding your head when I

00:43:17.220 --> 00:43:17.960
talked about Reddit.

00:43:17.960 --> 00:43:18.630
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

00:43:18.630 --> 00:43:19.370
NILOFER MERCHANT:
Did you see it?

00:43:19.370 --> 00:43:22.142
AUDIENCE: I went to a bad
TED a couple years ago.

00:43:22.142 --> 00:43:22.604
[INAUDIBLE].

00:43:22.604 --> 00:43:23.530
NILOFER MERCHANT: Yeah.

00:43:23.530 --> 00:43:26.410
So one of the things that they
actually just said in the

00:43:26.410 --> 00:43:27.320
interview process--

00:43:27.320 --> 00:43:30.720
because I was trying to get this
article to be really as

00:43:30.720 --> 00:43:31.450
tight as possible.

00:43:31.450 --> 00:43:34.380
And so I asked them, how do
you think about this?

00:43:34.380 --> 00:43:36.990
How do you think about the
management part of this?

00:43:36.990 --> 00:43:37.610
And they said, listen.

00:43:37.610 --> 00:43:39.860
It's not us managing.

00:43:39.860 --> 00:43:43.160
It's not me going out there
and saying, no, no, no.

00:43:43.160 --> 00:43:45.850
It's figuring out how to raise
the bar and standard where

00:43:45.850 --> 00:43:48.760
they tell each other no.

00:43:48.760 --> 00:43:52.580
You should not have, you should
not be a TEDx licensee.

00:43:52.580 --> 00:43:54.070
Not that person.

00:43:54.070 --> 00:43:57.520
And it finds a way
to filter out.

00:43:57.520 --> 00:44:00.100
It's a very similar system to
what eBay created when the

00:44:00.100 --> 00:44:01.190
first transactions happened.

00:44:01.190 --> 00:44:04.610
How do you build more trust in
the system because social era

00:44:04.610 --> 00:44:06.230
is all about relationships.

00:44:06.230 --> 00:44:08.810
So relationships are the way
in which we're going to

00:44:08.810 --> 00:44:09.250
measure it.

00:44:09.250 --> 00:44:10.820
Trust is an outcome
of a relationship.

00:44:10.820 --> 00:44:12.310
How do you build up trust?

00:44:12.310 --> 00:44:14.720
So they've got to figure out how
to build more metrics into

00:44:14.720 --> 00:44:18.280
the system, feedback loop back
to TED saying these people did

00:44:18.280 --> 00:44:20.490
not put on a good event, et
cetera so the license does not

00:44:20.490 --> 00:44:20.920
get renewed.

00:44:20.920 --> 00:44:23.670
So the system becomes
reinforcing.

00:44:23.670 --> 00:44:25.590
And peer reviews end up
really shaping that.

00:44:25.590 --> 00:44:26.690
So there are ways to do it.

00:44:26.690 --> 00:44:29.860
But they have to think about
it not as them telling, or

00:44:29.860 --> 00:44:33.420
them directing, or them even
being in charge because the

00:44:33.420 --> 00:44:35.115
way to do a community is to
have a community police.

00:44:37.980 --> 00:44:42.350
AUDIENCE: OK, so you're not
saying that in the face of a

00:44:42.350 --> 00:44:43.830
lot of bad actors, you
still need the

00:44:43.830 --> 00:44:44.870
gatekeeper to take a role.

00:44:44.870 --> 00:44:46.310
You're saying that's
still a solvable

00:44:46.310 --> 00:44:47.890
problem with the community.

00:44:47.890 --> 00:44:48.190
NILOFER MERCHANT: Mostly.

00:44:48.190 --> 00:44:50.970
And then I think as it bubbles
up-- like the guy who did the

00:44:50.970 --> 00:44:53.450
vortex mathematics talk, which
is the one I kind of mentioned

00:44:53.450 --> 00:44:54.650
around the Quora.

00:44:54.650 --> 00:44:55.550
It's a crazy talk.

00:44:55.550 --> 00:44:57.680
If you can actually still find
it somewhere online, it's

00:44:57.680 --> 00:44:59.880
really funny to watch because
the guy's just doing buzzword

00:44:59.880 --> 00:45:01.930
bingo as fast as he
possibly can.

00:45:01.930 --> 00:45:04.720
It's a hilarious talk in a
certain way because you're

00:45:04.720 --> 00:45:07.620
like what's he doing?

00:45:07.620 --> 00:45:11.760
So my opening line of my "Havard
Magazine" article is

00:45:11.760 --> 00:45:15.360
what fucking bullshit because
I'm quoting the professor

00:45:15.360 --> 00:45:16.910
who's like commenting
on the talk.

00:45:16.910 --> 00:45:18.610
So I feel pretty good that I
managed to start a "Havard

00:45:18.610 --> 00:45:21.620
Magazine" article with what
fucking bullshit.

00:45:21.620 --> 00:45:25.070
Try sneaking that in.

00:45:25.070 --> 00:45:26.870
But what that ends up
becoming is peer

00:45:26.870 --> 00:45:27.920
review raises an issue.

00:45:27.920 --> 00:45:29.116
And then of course, there's
a judgment call.

00:45:29.116 --> 00:45:33.410
So it never eliminates the role
of the central body if

00:45:33.410 --> 00:45:34.650
you still want to manage that.

00:45:34.650 --> 00:45:37.290
But you get like 99% of
it to happen out here.

00:45:37.290 --> 00:45:40.490
And you want accountability
because this is

00:45:40.490 --> 00:45:41.520
all about an exchange.

00:45:41.520 --> 00:45:45.240
So you can't sort of hold onto
the accountability and expect

00:45:45.240 --> 00:45:47.190
people to feel ownership.

00:45:47.190 --> 00:45:48.680
It works inside an
organization.

00:45:48.680 --> 00:45:49.890
It works external.

00:45:49.890 --> 00:45:52.470
The more you give people power,
the more they end up

00:45:52.470 --> 00:45:55.210
creating and bring their
full selves to work.

00:45:55.210 --> 00:45:56.650
So you want everything
like that.

00:45:56.650 --> 00:45:58.760
You want to figure out how do I
assign this thing that might

00:45:58.760 --> 00:46:02.130
be in my head as far away from
me as possible so the thing

00:46:02.130 --> 00:46:03.980
that really matters is managed,
and everything else

00:46:03.980 --> 00:46:05.770
can be their own source
of creativity.

00:46:05.770 --> 00:46:08.310
Did I answer the question?

00:46:08.310 --> 00:46:10.890
PRESENTER: Well, thank you so
much, Nilofer, for coming in.

00:46:10.890 --> 00:46:12.660
It's been a really
interesting chat.

00:46:12.660 --> 00:46:17.160
And we're going to post this
talk online as well on the

00:46:17.160 --> 00:46:18.640
Authors at Channel.

00:46:18.640 --> 00:46:20.850
So thanks everyone for coming
and dialing in.
