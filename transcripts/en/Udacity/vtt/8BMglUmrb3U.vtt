00:00:00.450 --> 00:00:04.130
Now because Ginny's mutation is spontaneous, meaning that

00:00:04.130 --> 00:00:06.080
it's the first time it's happened to her

00:00:06.080 --> 00:00:09.010
in her family, we wouldn't expect to see

00:00:09.010 --> 00:00:11.040
any more family members in her pedigree to

00:00:11.040 --> 00:00:16.920
be affected by achondroplasia, or dwarfism. Remember, pedigrees

00:00:16.920 --> 00:00:19.750
can be useful in many instances, but sometimes

00:00:19.750 --> 00:00:21.780
a new trait appears, because of a new

00:00:21.780 --> 00:00:25.580
mutation, and not from Hidden alleles somewhere way back

00:00:25.580 --> 00:00:26.350
in the families.
