JINAL DALAL: Good evening--

00:00:07.100 --> 00:00:08.960
hi.

00:00:08.960 --> 00:00:11.570
I'm going to present electronic
design for Android Things

00:00:11.570 --> 00:00:13.610
Systems on modules.

00:00:13.610 --> 00:00:15.215
My name is Jinal Dalal.

00:00:15.215 --> 00:00:17.660
I'm a hardware engineer
for Android Things.

00:00:17.660 --> 00:00:19.130
And I'm really
excited to present

00:00:19.130 --> 00:00:22.250
to you this particular
talk, especially

00:00:22.250 --> 00:00:25.880
because I built hardware for
Google for about 10 years.

00:00:25.880 --> 00:00:29.150
And I built for
consumer and enterprise.

00:00:29.150 --> 00:00:32.000
So everything that you
see here are the things

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:34.340
that I've learned over
the past 10 years.

00:00:34.340 --> 00:00:37.350
And please don't repeat
the same mistakes.

00:00:37.350 --> 00:00:40.170
All right, let's get started.

00:00:40.170 --> 00:00:44.420
So before I get into the details
of how to build hardware,

00:00:44.420 --> 00:00:46.790
Android Things has
System on Module,

00:00:46.790 --> 00:00:49.610
which is the core component
of Android Things, which

00:00:49.610 --> 00:00:56.660
has CPU, memory, power, as
well as Wi-Fi and Bluetooth.

00:00:56.660 --> 00:00:59.990
This is the core component
of Android Things, which

00:00:59.990 --> 00:01:04.519
allows you to take all the
complexity out of your hardware

00:01:04.519 --> 00:01:06.320
and put the wrapper around it.

00:01:06.320 --> 00:01:08.660
So going into the
detail, this board

00:01:08.660 --> 00:01:11.090
is about 2 inches by 2 inches.

00:01:11.090 --> 00:01:13.340
And it, basically,
is something you

00:01:13.340 --> 00:01:15.270
can buy off-the-shelf today.

00:01:15.270 --> 00:01:17.030
So if you were to
think of an idea

00:01:17.030 --> 00:01:20.505
that you want to build using
this as the core module,

00:01:20.505 --> 00:01:22.130
you don't have to go
out and design it.

00:01:22.130 --> 00:01:23.750
And all the technical
complexity around this

00:01:23.750 --> 00:01:24.916
has been taken away from it.

00:01:28.470 --> 00:01:31.890
As far as this particular
talk, the thing

00:01:31.890 --> 00:01:34.890
that we built
internally into Google,

00:01:34.890 --> 00:01:38.200
in a very simplified
way, is the baseboard.

00:01:38.200 --> 00:01:41.040
This is the board
that goes with the SoM

00:01:41.040 --> 00:01:44.110
and allows you to add
more functionality to it.

00:01:44.110 --> 00:01:50.160
So imagine use cases like
cameras, routers, and displays

00:01:50.160 --> 00:01:53.350
that would like to use the
SoM as the core component.

00:01:53.350 --> 00:01:59.240
It's the baseboard that you end
up designing for your solution.

00:01:59.240 --> 00:02:01.140
In this particular
case that I designed,

00:02:01.140 --> 00:02:07.080
it had USB ports, audio,
HTML, buttons, LEDs.

00:02:07.080 --> 00:02:08.940
So this is something
you can design.

00:02:08.940 --> 00:02:12.540
This does not require a whole
team of hardware engineers

00:02:12.540 --> 00:02:14.694
to go out and design it for you.

00:02:14.694 --> 00:02:16.860
And I'm going to walk you
through those steps of how

00:02:16.860 --> 00:02:21.330
to actually do those things
as part of this talk.

00:02:21.330 --> 00:02:24.630
All right, before jumping into
the details of hardware design

00:02:24.630 --> 00:02:27.840
again, Android Things
joins this group

00:02:27.840 --> 00:02:32.340
of Android platform, which are
about 2 billion devices that

00:02:32.340 --> 00:02:33.660
exist today.

00:02:33.660 --> 00:02:38.080
As well as, it takes advantage
of the Android framework,

00:02:38.080 --> 00:02:41.130
so it allows you to use
what you already know.

00:02:41.130 --> 00:02:46.710
For example, even in cases
of cars, TVs, watches,

00:02:46.710 --> 00:02:49.075
and wearables, as
well as cell phones--

00:02:49.075 --> 00:02:50.950
you're already familiar
with these platforms.

00:02:50.950 --> 00:02:53.940
And now, you're using this to
build IoT devices around it.

00:02:57.460 --> 00:03:01.290
From the ideas perspective
and from what this enables,

00:03:01.290 --> 00:03:04.690
there are a bunch of options
to go out and design.

00:03:04.690 --> 00:03:07.930
In terms of home, you can
think about security systems,

00:03:07.930 --> 00:03:11.980
speakers, routers, doorbells.

00:03:11.980 --> 00:03:16.300
For enterprise--
point-of-sale, interactive ads,

00:03:16.300 --> 00:03:17.560
vending machines.

00:03:17.560 --> 00:03:19.870
I'm going to share
some examples of that.

00:03:19.870 --> 00:03:24.700
And for more of building
and enterprise buildings,

00:03:24.700 --> 00:03:27.970
it's cameras,
[INAUDIBLE],, smart meters.

00:03:27.970 --> 00:03:30.790
And for cars and
fleet management,

00:03:30.790 --> 00:03:33.250
you could think about
smart parkings, car audios,

00:03:33.250 --> 00:03:34.090
and so on.

00:03:34.090 --> 00:03:36.100
The opportunities are endless.

00:03:36.100 --> 00:03:39.160
There will be about 20
billion devices by 2020.

00:03:39.160 --> 00:03:44.650
And so this really opens
up the whole opportunity.

00:03:44.650 --> 00:03:47.140
In terms of hardware,
how many of you

00:03:47.140 --> 00:03:48.910
here have actually
designed hardware

00:03:48.910 --> 00:03:50.470
or been part of the design?

00:03:50.470 --> 00:03:56.170
So having realized a few
of them, this is really--

00:03:56.170 --> 00:03:58.930
we're at this point where
hardware is really not

00:03:58.930 --> 00:04:00.820
about different or hard.

00:04:00.820 --> 00:04:04.660
It's more about how you
actually go through the process

00:04:04.660 --> 00:04:05.840
to build it.

00:04:05.840 --> 00:04:08.800
So as much as how
software is built,

00:04:08.800 --> 00:04:10.510
hardware is built differently.

00:04:10.510 --> 00:04:13.510
But the focus should be, really,
on making those small steps

00:04:13.510 --> 00:04:18.180
to get you to the right platform
and to the more solid hardware.

00:04:18.180 --> 00:04:21.560
So there are three things that
have happened in the past,

00:04:21.560 --> 00:04:23.810
I would say, five years that
have phenomenally changed

00:04:23.810 --> 00:04:25.340
the way hardware is built.

00:04:25.340 --> 00:04:27.430
One-- there are 3D printers.

00:04:27.430 --> 00:04:32.830
If you think about a box or
a photo frame or anything

00:04:32.830 --> 00:04:34.870
that you would like to
design, you can actually

00:04:34.870 --> 00:04:36.280
go print it out today.

00:04:36.280 --> 00:04:39.190
This plus the IoT platform
that we are building

00:04:39.190 --> 00:04:43.030
would enable you to build
a product around it.

00:04:43.030 --> 00:04:45.040
Secondly, there
is crowdsourcing.

00:04:45.040 --> 00:04:48.070
And third, is the cost of
manufacturing-- all these three

00:04:48.070 --> 00:04:51.070
things allow you to
experiment with the ideas

00:04:51.070 --> 00:04:55.230
without actually needing a
big team to go out and do it.

00:04:55.230 --> 00:04:57.240
Again, going back
to this example,

00:04:57.240 --> 00:05:00.550
this along with the wrapper
took us one person at Google

00:05:00.550 --> 00:05:03.940
to go out and build it.

00:05:03.940 --> 00:05:05.740
These are just two
general examples

00:05:05.740 --> 00:05:09.010
of what you can do with
the existing solutions.

00:05:09.010 --> 00:05:11.890
For example, a vending machine
that doesn't have a display

00:05:11.890 --> 00:05:15.560
can start using display and
a phone for its check-out.

00:05:15.560 --> 00:05:18.160
And with this Android
Things platform,

00:05:18.160 --> 00:05:20.680
you are able to actually
experiment with it.

00:05:20.680 --> 00:05:23.080
As well as the pill
dispenser, again,

00:05:23.080 --> 00:05:27.520
allows you to manage the
schedule for the pills as well

00:05:27.520 --> 00:05:30.940
as notifications
and so on-- again,

00:05:30.940 --> 00:05:33.520
making something that's
been there for a while

00:05:33.520 --> 00:05:34.450
and making it smart.

00:05:39.510 --> 00:05:43.470
So before we talk about
the process again,

00:05:43.470 --> 00:05:45.810
this is the board that
I was just showing you.

00:05:45.810 --> 00:05:49.410
The red is the baseboard
that I designed.

00:05:49.410 --> 00:05:51.870
The green is the
System-on-Module

00:05:51.870 --> 00:05:55.320
that sits on the baseboard.

00:05:55.320 --> 00:05:58.780
As you can see, this
was for an XP device.

00:05:58.780 --> 00:06:01.310
So the SoM is
actually an XP device.

00:06:01.310 --> 00:06:03.810
But the baseboard is flexible.

00:06:03.810 --> 00:06:06.750
It allows you to add any
features that you would

00:06:06.750 --> 00:06:12.060
like to use for your product.

00:06:12.060 --> 00:06:13.900
All right, so process--

00:06:13.900 --> 00:06:17.730
the first step for hardware
design is planning.

00:06:17.730 --> 00:06:20.740
Planning really means
identifying the core components

00:06:20.740 --> 00:06:23.100
and features that
you want and then

00:06:23.100 --> 00:06:27.240
sketching it out on paper to
figure out how it all connects.

00:06:27.240 --> 00:06:28.680
Second is prototype.

00:06:28.680 --> 00:06:32.700
Prototype is about actually
buying off-the-shelf hardware

00:06:32.700 --> 00:06:35.070
and implementing it
as an experiment.

00:06:35.070 --> 00:06:37.020
Third is design.

00:06:37.020 --> 00:06:39.474
From a software standpoint,
design is making the UI.

00:06:39.474 --> 00:06:40.890
From a hardware
standpoint, you're

00:06:40.890 --> 00:06:42.389
really getting into
the nitty-gritty

00:06:42.389 --> 00:06:46.050
of using the schematic
tools, the layout tools,

00:06:46.050 --> 00:06:49.090
as well as releasing
those for manufacturing.

00:06:49.090 --> 00:06:50.790
And last is qualify.

00:06:50.790 --> 00:06:54.180
Each of these steps really
needs to be followed

00:06:54.180 --> 00:06:57.090
and are really critical for
the success of your design.

00:06:57.090 --> 00:06:59.490
And it needs to be
repeated to ensure that you

00:06:59.490 --> 00:07:00.825
can keep building more volumes.

00:07:03.420 --> 00:07:06.570
So let's go into
the detail for plan.

00:07:06.570 --> 00:07:09.540
Planning, from the
hardware standpoint,

00:07:09.540 --> 00:07:14.080
is really-- one, identifying
the features that you want.

00:07:14.080 --> 00:07:15.960
So you want USB support?

00:07:15.960 --> 00:07:17.100
You need a USB connector.

00:07:17.100 --> 00:07:19.500
If you want audio, you need
to add audio connector.

00:07:19.500 --> 00:07:24.690
If you want to use a display,
this, again, needs to go here.

00:07:24.690 --> 00:07:27.480
It's critical to actually
sketch your design up

00:07:27.480 --> 00:07:30.420
before you start
implementing it.

00:07:30.420 --> 00:07:31.720
This is a critical step.

00:07:31.720 --> 00:07:34.080
And you need to think about
all the features, as well

00:07:34.080 --> 00:07:37.860
as the rest of the things,
which is power and size.

00:07:37.860 --> 00:07:40.110
So this is in a
different dimension.

00:07:40.110 --> 00:07:43.530
Think about how hot this
product is going to get.

00:07:43.530 --> 00:07:45.310
Where is it going to be used?

00:07:45.310 --> 00:07:51.090
Is it going to need cables
from your product standpoint?

00:07:51.090 --> 00:07:53.670
Beyond that, also
think about the cost

00:07:53.670 --> 00:07:55.320
very early on, so
that you don't end up

00:07:55.320 --> 00:07:58.500
buying components that are
expensive from the beginning.

00:07:58.500 --> 00:08:00.660
And then finally, how
is it all powered?

00:08:00.660 --> 00:08:03.630
Is it a battery powered or AC?

00:08:03.630 --> 00:08:05.440
This also matters in the design.

00:08:05.440 --> 00:08:06.700
So that's the planning piece.

00:08:09.760 --> 00:08:11.500
Next is prototype--

00:08:11.500 --> 00:08:14.650
I want to emphasize
the value of prototype.

00:08:14.650 --> 00:08:17.410
When you start thinking
about your design

00:08:17.410 --> 00:08:21.010
and you think that you need
to wait all the way until you

00:08:21.010 --> 00:08:23.950
actually design everything
in schematic and layout,

00:08:23.950 --> 00:08:25.180
it's already too late.

00:08:25.180 --> 00:08:28.070
And you already spent thousands
of dollars to get there.

00:08:28.070 --> 00:08:31.690
So before you do that, try and
see if you can buy components

00:08:31.690 --> 00:08:33.280
online.

00:08:33.280 --> 00:08:34.960
Put it on the breadboard.

00:08:34.960 --> 00:08:36.400
Connect wires.

00:08:36.400 --> 00:08:39.331
And get your basic
functionality in place.

00:08:39.331 --> 00:08:40.539
Again-- I'm going to repeat--

00:08:40.539 --> 00:08:44.690
get your basic functionality
in place as much as possible,

00:08:44.690 --> 00:08:49.400
so you know exactly what you
are using, how you are using it,

00:08:49.400 --> 00:08:52.600
how much power does it draw,
and even to the extent that--

00:08:52.600 --> 00:08:53.800
how does it look?

00:08:53.800 --> 00:08:57.190
If you can 3D print
something or use a cardboard,

00:08:57.190 --> 00:08:58.540
it's worth trying it.

00:08:58.540 --> 00:09:00.697
Because by the time you
get it to the production,

00:09:00.697 --> 00:09:01.780
it's going to be too late.

00:09:06.470 --> 00:09:11.850
Design-- this is something where
most of the software developers

00:09:11.850 --> 00:09:15.180
are going to be challenged, in
terms of how to actually start

00:09:15.180 --> 00:09:18.360
implementing the schematics.

00:09:18.360 --> 00:09:21.270
Fortunately, again,
in the last few years,

00:09:21.270 --> 00:09:23.580
there are a lot of
open source options

00:09:23.580 --> 00:09:27.420
that you can use to start
sketching out your design.

00:09:27.420 --> 00:09:32.310
As an example, a key CAD
is an open source schematic

00:09:32.310 --> 00:09:36.180
and layout tool that you
can use today with no cost

00:09:36.180 --> 00:09:38.520
and try a simple board.

00:09:38.520 --> 00:09:40.380
There are a few other
options as well,

00:09:40.380 --> 00:09:43.650
from Altium, Cadence, and Eagle.

00:09:43.650 --> 00:09:46.770
And each one has its
own pros and cons.

00:09:46.770 --> 00:09:51.210
For example, depending on
how many layers the board is

00:09:51.210 --> 00:09:54.570
or the cost that you're
willing to pay for this tool,

00:09:54.570 --> 00:09:58.110
each one has its own trade-offs.

00:09:58.110 --> 00:10:01.110
In my particular case,
we ended up using Altium,

00:10:01.110 --> 00:10:03.510
mostly because
it's what I knew--

00:10:03.510 --> 00:10:05.820
as well as what I was trying
to build, which was an 8

00:10:05.820 --> 00:10:06.750
to 10-layer board.

00:10:09.660 --> 00:10:11.100
All right, let's
dig a little bit

00:10:11.100 --> 00:10:13.800
deeper into what a
schematic really is.

00:10:13.800 --> 00:10:17.490
So from a hardware
standpoint, the schematic

00:10:17.490 --> 00:10:20.940
has a 2D representation
of your design.

00:10:20.940 --> 00:10:22.800
Every component
that you can think

00:10:22.800 --> 00:10:24.660
about that's going
to be on your board

00:10:24.660 --> 00:10:27.030
needs to be on the schematic.

00:10:27.030 --> 00:10:30.960
As you can see over onto
the screen, on the left side

00:10:30.960 --> 00:10:32.190
is the capacitors.

00:10:32.190 --> 00:10:37.020
That's marked as C1, C2, which
are the reference designators.

00:10:37.020 --> 00:10:39.090
The one in the
yellow are generally

00:10:39.090 --> 00:10:42.170
ASICs or connectors,
the components that

00:10:42.170 --> 00:10:47.830
are tied to these components.

00:10:47.830 --> 00:10:49.920
There is ground,
which is represented

00:10:49.920 --> 00:10:52.920
by the lines, which represents
the ground of the board.

00:10:52.920 --> 00:10:57.390
There is the power, which is
the input to your circuit.

00:10:57.390 --> 00:11:00.009
And then all of these
traces that you see

00:11:00.009 --> 00:11:01.050
are all your connections.

00:11:01.050 --> 00:11:03.100
They're physical
traces that are going

00:11:03.100 --> 00:11:06.500
to be populated onto the board
to make these connections.

00:11:10.990 --> 00:11:13.510
After you are finished
your schematic,

00:11:13.510 --> 00:11:16.450
the next step is to
start doing the layout.

00:11:16.450 --> 00:11:21.190
Layout is, in some sense,
a 3D representation

00:11:21.190 --> 00:11:23.320
of what your design is.

00:11:23.320 --> 00:11:26.410
You start thinking about
where the components go

00:11:26.410 --> 00:11:28.780
physically on the design--

00:11:28.780 --> 00:11:30.940
how they are routed.

00:11:30.940 --> 00:11:34.750
Not going into too much
detail, but this hardware

00:11:34.750 --> 00:11:36.970
is tied to physics.

00:11:36.970 --> 00:11:40.060
And so how do you run your
single-ended and differential

00:11:40.060 --> 00:11:45.160
pairs, like clocks and signals,
are critical in the design.

00:11:45.160 --> 00:11:48.010
And this is where you can
leverage either some help

00:11:48.010 --> 00:11:50.470
from online schematic
or data sheets

00:11:50.470 --> 00:11:52.630
or work with somebody you know.

00:11:52.630 --> 00:11:55.600
But this is where you need
to spend some time thinking

00:11:55.600 --> 00:11:57.660
about how your
board needs to look,

00:11:57.660 --> 00:11:59.530
where the key
components need to go.

00:12:02.850 --> 00:12:06.000
This is what the board's
layout looked like.

00:12:06.000 --> 00:12:07.680
And this is just
one of the layers.

00:12:07.680 --> 00:12:10.170
There were eight
years on this board.

00:12:10.170 --> 00:12:13.650
The traces are the lines that
you see going from the top

00:12:13.650 --> 00:12:15.120
to the bottom--

00:12:15.120 --> 00:12:17.520
are essentially
the physical traces

00:12:17.520 --> 00:12:21.330
that have been routed
to a connector.

00:12:21.330 --> 00:12:26.460
The yellow, I would say, text
is reference designators.

00:12:26.460 --> 00:12:28.980
And if you care about how you're
going to debug this board,

00:12:28.980 --> 00:12:32.250
you need to ensure that these
things are placed properly.

00:12:32.250 --> 00:12:36.400
Similarly, some of the
symbols represent where

00:12:36.400 --> 00:12:40.150
the components need to go.

00:12:40.150 --> 00:12:41.800
Once you're done
with the layout,

00:12:41.800 --> 00:12:45.520
the next step is to see
what exactly it looks like.

00:12:45.520 --> 00:12:46.990
And this is pretty cool.

00:12:46.990 --> 00:12:51.790
In hardware, you can
actually start, not only

00:12:51.790 --> 00:12:54.100
thinking about what you are
trying to build but also

00:12:54.100 --> 00:12:56.290
feel and see what it is.

00:12:56.290 --> 00:12:58.380
And this is very things
get really exciting.

00:12:58.380 --> 00:13:00.130
You need to take the
time to actually look

00:13:00.130 --> 00:13:03.520
at where your components
are in this framework.

00:13:03.520 --> 00:13:06.700
For example, are my
buttons in the right place?

00:13:06.700 --> 00:13:08.350
Is LED accessible?

00:13:08.350 --> 00:13:13.150
Are the connectors
accessible for connecting?

00:13:13.150 --> 00:13:15.910
This is where you can physically
check every single thing

00:13:15.910 --> 00:13:19.730
to make sure that they're
lined up properly.

00:13:19.730 --> 00:13:21.580
For example, one of
the issues that we

00:13:21.580 --> 00:13:24.130
found when we were
designing this board

00:13:24.130 --> 00:13:26.950
is the LED was actually
placed in the back.

00:13:26.950 --> 00:13:29.350
And so it wasn't
visually possible

00:13:29.350 --> 00:13:32.980
to see the LEDs from the
front when they are blinking,

00:13:32.980 --> 00:13:35.080
especially for error LEDs.

00:13:35.080 --> 00:13:37.630
So it's important, again,
to think about these

00:13:37.630 --> 00:13:40.960
as part of your design.

00:13:40.960 --> 00:13:45.010
After you are done with
this, what happens next

00:13:45.010 --> 00:13:49.090
is really taken over by
the manufacturing company.

00:13:49.090 --> 00:13:52.770
But what you need to send
them is the Gerber files.

00:13:52.770 --> 00:13:54.910
Now, if you don't know
what the Gerber files are,

00:13:54.910 --> 00:14:00.460
Gerber files are or a
software text presentation

00:14:00.460 --> 00:14:04.630
of each of these components,
the size of the board,

00:14:04.630 --> 00:14:09.220
the traces, the holes that need
to go onto the board, as well

00:14:09.220 --> 00:14:11.050
as all the connections.

00:14:11.050 --> 00:14:12.910
This is a file that
you then send over

00:14:12.910 --> 00:14:16.810
to your manufacturing
company, who then ends up

00:14:16.810 --> 00:14:18.310
building it for you.

00:14:18.310 --> 00:14:22.640
It's important for them to
not only check this for you,

00:14:22.640 --> 00:14:24.190
but this is also
something that they

00:14:24.190 --> 00:14:26.500
will help you confirm
that they received

00:14:26.500 --> 00:14:28.000
all the right information.

00:14:28.000 --> 00:14:30.100
A critical step in
this process, even

00:14:30.100 --> 00:14:32.650
though it might seem simple--

00:14:32.650 --> 00:14:34.810
in my case, there
was an instance

00:14:34.810 --> 00:14:38.350
where they received the files,
but they were corrupted.

00:14:38.350 --> 00:14:40.660
And they couldn't actually
built the right board--

00:14:40.660 --> 00:14:43.480
so expensive and
important step that you

00:14:43.480 --> 00:14:45.610
need to pay attention to.

00:14:45.610 --> 00:14:49.250
In terms of manufacturing,
there are two options today,

00:14:49.250 --> 00:14:51.190
which is really great,
in terms of the cost.

00:14:51.190 --> 00:14:53.490
And there are
trade-offs for each one.

00:14:53.490 --> 00:14:55.000
One is local.

00:14:55.000 --> 00:14:57.970
Once your board is ready,
you have your Gerber files,

00:14:57.970 --> 00:15:00.870
you could release it
to somebody locally.

00:15:00.870 --> 00:15:04.030
Either it's US or
somewhere else,

00:15:04.030 --> 00:15:05.590
which generally costs higher.

00:15:05.590 --> 00:15:09.190
And here are a few examples
of companies you can use.

00:15:09.190 --> 00:15:11.980
Or you can do it offshore.

00:15:11.980 --> 00:15:16.460
There, the trade-off
is the cost is cheaper,

00:15:16.460 --> 00:15:17.890
but it also takes
much longer time

00:15:17.890 --> 00:15:19.330
for you to receive your boards.

00:15:22.930 --> 00:15:26.830
Key takeaways for
manufacturing-- one,

00:15:26.830 --> 00:15:28.892
test every board.

00:15:28.892 --> 00:15:30.850
It is important that
you're building your board

00:15:30.850 --> 00:15:32.440
for the first time.

00:15:32.440 --> 00:15:34.960
Do not make the assumption
that it's the replica.

00:15:34.960 --> 00:15:36.417
And it's just going to work.

00:15:36.417 --> 00:15:38.500
You have to test every
single board that comes out

00:15:38.500 --> 00:15:40.360
of the line for the first time.

00:15:40.360 --> 00:15:44.770
Two, visually inspect before you
actually start powering it on.

00:15:44.770 --> 00:15:48.490
There was an instance where
I had the capacitor reversed.

00:15:48.490 --> 00:15:51.640
And as soon as I plugged in
the power, it actually blew.

00:15:51.640 --> 00:15:52.930
And there was real fire.

00:15:52.930 --> 00:15:54.810
So this is real.

00:15:54.810 --> 00:15:56.650
You got to pay attention
to your design.

00:15:56.650 --> 00:15:59.980
It does matter how careful
you are before you actually

00:15:59.980 --> 00:16:01.240
turn on the power.

00:16:01.240 --> 00:16:05.020
In turn, if possible,
don't wait until the boards

00:16:05.020 --> 00:16:06.340
are shipped to you.

00:16:06.340 --> 00:16:08.050
Go to the factory, if you can.

00:16:08.050 --> 00:16:10.660
See as soon as they come out.

00:16:10.660 --> 00:16:14.740
And make sure that
they work as intended.

00:16:14.740 --> 00:16:17.410
There have been instances
where, by the time they reach--

00:16:17.410 --> 00:16:20.440
after 10 to 15 days,
you might find a bug.

00:16:20.440 --> 00:16:24.800
And now, it takes another
set of changes and time

00:16:24.800 --> 00:16:26.590
before you can get
this error corrected.

00:16:26.590 --> 00:16:31.740
Versus in software-- you can
just do it in a few seconds.

00:16:31.740 --> 00:16:35.540
All right-- once you have your
board, you've received it,

00:16:35.540 --> 00:16:38.900
you've checked for
key components,

00:16:38.900 --> 00:16:41.250
whether they have been
populated properly or not--

00:16:41.250 --> 00:16:43.560
the next step is to debug.

00:16:43.560 --> 00:16:47.070
If you have some
basic e-skills, you

00:16:47.070 --> 00:16:49.590
can use a multimeter
to check your signals

00:16:49.590 --> 00:16:51.030
and see if they are wiggling.

00:16:51.030 --> 00:16:53.460
You can use a scope,
if you have one.

00:16:53.460 --> 00:16:57.060
But really, the key
message here is, try

00:16:57.060 --> 00:16:59.040
and debug as much as possible.

00:16:59.040 --> 00:17:04.339
I'll give you one example here
that is not obvious to you.

00:17:04.339 --> 00:17:08.940
But or on the right
side for you, the one

00:17:08.940 --> 00:17:11.190
that is marked as D is a Diode.

00:17:11.190 --> 00:17:15.540
And what we realize, as part
of our manufacturing process,

00:17:15.540 --> 00:17:19.109
is that the diode was
actually the worst.

00:17:19.109 --> 00:17:22.890
And this diode actually
serves as D card--

00:17:22.890 --> 00:17:25.050
as D card wasn't detected.

00:17:25.050 --> 00:17:27.390
Again, visually
really hard to see.

00:17:27.390 --> 00:17:32.470
But this ended up being a bug in
our design, where the diode was

00:17:32.470 --> 00:17:35.040
placed reversed and
ended up causing

00:17:35.040 --> 00:17:36.840
us a No Detect for the SD card.

00:17:40.190 --> 00:17:43.220
Thermals-- I'm briefly
going to touch on thermals.

00:17:43.220 --> 00:17:48.510
But this is an important aspect
of the hardware design as well.

00:17:48.510 --> 00:17:53.530
So you would assume that, if the
hardware works on your table,

00:17:53.530 --> 00:17:55.140
it's going to work on your desk.

00:17:55.140 --> 00:17:57.170
It's going to work
everywhere else.

00:17:57.170 --> 00:17:58.190
That's not true.

00:17:58.190 --> 00:18:01.040
As soon as you start
bumping up the temperature

00:18:01.040 --> 00:18:03.770
on the hardware, you will start
seeing all kinds of issues,

00:18:03.770 --> 00:18:07.850
from shut down to heating
up some components

00:18:07.850 --> 00:18:09.422
and causing fire.

00:18:09.422 --> 00:18:11.630
It's important to think
about the critical components

00:18:11.630 --> 00:18:13.770
in your design and
make sure you meet

00:18:13.770 --> 00:18:17.480
the guidelines and the operating
specs of those components.

00:18:17.480 --> 00:18:20.830
If you can detect, in
this particular case,

00:18:20.830 --> 00:18:24.230
I have a heat sink for the CPU.

00:18:24.230 --> 00:18:27.140
And initially, based
on our experiments,

00:18:27.140 --> 00:18:31.880
we realize that a heat
sink may not be required.

00:18:31.880 --> 00:18:35.150
After trying a few
experiments on the desk,

00:18:35.150 --> 00:18:37.160
as well as in a
thermal chamber, we

00:18:37.160 --> 00:18:40.220
realized that this was
required to operate

00:18:40.220 --> 00:18:44.090
the CPU at a particular
temperature range.

00:18:44.090 --> 00:18:46.350
Again, a small thing
in this design--

00:18:46.350 --> 00:18:48.710
got to pay attention to it.

00:18:48.710 --> 00:18:52.730
Lastly, mechanicals-- after you
have done your hardware design

00:18:52.730 --> 00:18:55.400
and finished the design
for it, the next step

00:18:55.400 --> 00:18:58.460
is what the
enclosure looks like.

00:18:58.460 --> 00:19:03.740
With 3D printing, you can print
something out and test it out.

00:19:03.740 --> 00:19:08.720
Critical here is to look
for all the instances

00:19:08.720 --> 00:19:10.950
where you're going to
interact with your design.

00:19:10.950 --> 00:19:13.340
If there is a button,
make sure it's accessible

00:19:13.340 --> 00:19:15.470
and it's in the place
where you want it to be.

00:19:15.470 --> 00:19:19.080
If it is LEDs, you
should be visually

00:19:19.080 --> 00:19:23.690
able to see them from what
is expected out of it.

00:19:23.690 --> 00:19:27.290
Similarly, for connectors, make
sure that they're not locked.

00:19:27.290 --> 00:19:30.470
It's always worth experimenting
and printing something out

00:19:30.470 --> 00:19:35.240
or use a cardboard to make
sure that the e-components are

00:19:35.240 --> 00:19:37.850
in its place before you
go to the next step.

00:19:41.300 --> 00:19:43.400
In terms of mechanicals,
there are two options

00:19:43.400 --> 00:19:46.790
to actually design it.

00:19:46.790 --> 00:19:48.920
One is called soft-tooling.

00:19:48.920 --> 00:19:50.470
And the other one
is hard-tooling.

00:19:50.470 --> 00:19:55.830
In soft-tooling-- this is
where the cost is higher.

00:19:55.830 --> 00:19:58.340
The turnaround time
is, again, shorter.

00:19:58.340 --> 00:20:02.820
And it is really designed
for limited-use cases.

00:20:02.820 --> 00:20:06.465
So if you expected the lifetime
of a product to be three years,

00:20:06.465 --> 00:20:09.780
a part that is soft-tooled
might last only a year.

00:20:09.780 --> 00:20:13.430
A hard-tool is where you
actually use the sheet metal

00:20:13.430 --> 00:20:18.890
and use a hard-tooling
solution to build your product.

00:20:18.890 --> 00:20:20.900
This is higher cost.

00:20:20.900 --> 00:20:26.740
There is a high NRE associated
with it, a slower turn around--

00:20:26.740 --> 00:20:29.570
used mostly for
high-volume products.

00:20:29.570 --> 00:20:34.460
And it's designed for the
full life of the product.

00:20:34.460 --> 00:20:37.030
When you buy
consumer electronics,

00:20:37.030 --> 00:20:39.380
most of the tooling
is hard-tooled.

00:20:39.380 --> 00:20:41.810
While all the
experimental hardware

00:20:41.810 --> 00:20:45.050
that you have internally
or at your desk,

00:20:45.050 --> 00:20:48.420
for example, might
all be soft-tooled.

00:20:48.420 --> 00:20:51.220
OK, finally, qualify--

00:20:51.220 --> 00:20:55.390
I think, after you have finished
all the aspects of this design,

00:20:55.390 --> 00:20:58.720
you've got to qualify your
product from end-to-end,

00:20:58.720 --> 00:21:00.070
in terms of software.

00:21:00.070 --> 00:21:01.900
So bring the hardware up.

00:21:01.900 --> 00:21:05.020
Run all the software
on top of it.

00:21:05.020 --> 00:21:06.940
And make sure the
design is solid

00:21:06.940 --> 00:21:10.150
and all the features are
meeting your expectations.

00:21:10.150 --> 00:21:12.430
And set up a password
criteria for them,

00:21:12.430 --> 00:21:16.780
so that you know what's going to
happen if certain features are

00:21:16.780 --> 00:21:20.020
turned on and off.

00:21:20.020 --> 00:21:23.940
This finishes the cycle
from plan to qualify.

00:21:23.940 --> 00:21:27.850
And in some ways, you would
think that you are done.

00:21:27.850 --> 00:21:33.290
Not yet-- take this
process that I just showed.

00:21:33.290 --> 00:21:35.740
And if you are trying to
build a product that's

00:21:35.740 --> 00:21:38.950
going to be thousands
of units, you

00:21:38.950 --> 00:21:42.610
need to move on to the
next phase, which is

00:21:42.610 --> 00:21:44.230
what I'm going to go through.

00:21:44.230 --> 00:21:49.240
So EVT is the Engineering
Validation Test.

00:21:49.240 --> 00:21:51.340
The whole process
that I just showed you

00:21:51.340 --> 00:21:54.700
needs to be repeated for EVT.

00:21:54.700 --> 00:21:59.080
Generally, EVT is
about tens of units.

00:21:59.080 --> 00:22:03.550
And the goal here-- to validate
your schematics, your layout,

00:22:03.550 --> 00:22:08.710
your design, the core features,
the components on the board,

00:22:08.710 --> 00:22:11.560
and ensuring that it all works.

00:22:11.560 --> 00:22:15.130
It is not necessarily designed
to run all the software that

00:22:15.130 --> 00:22:17.620
is expected at the end product.

00:22:17.620 --> 00:22:21.050
The cost for EVT is high.

00:22:21.050 --> 00:22:24.760
So in some ways, you would think
that the cost of the product

00:22:24.760 --> 00:22:26.110
is going to be high.

00:22:26.110 --> 00:22:28.640
But that's not necessarily true.

00:22:28.640 --> 00:22:31.900
There are a few reasons why
the cost for EVT is high.

00:22:31.900 --> 00:22:34.670
One, it's low volumes.

00:22:34.670 --> 00:22:38.110
Two, it is manufactured
in a very controlled way.

00:22:38.110 --> 00:22:39.940
So there is a high
cost associated

00:22:39.940 --> 00:22:41.740
from an NRE standpoint.

00:22:41.740 --> 00:22:44.680
And then, three, the
components that you buy

00:22:44.680 --> 00:22:46.720
are also going to be limited.

00:22:46.720 --> 00:22:51.140
And so that's going to
keep your costs high.

00:22:51.140 --> 00:22:52.350
Next, is DVT.

00:22:52.350 --> 00:22:55.230
DVT is the Design
Validation process,

00:22:55.230 --> 00:22:58.040
where you validate the
design and also involve

00:22:58.040 --> 00:23:01.800
some of the software
teams into your platform.

00:23:01.800 --> 00:23:05.870
This is also where you
test our software bugs.

00:23:05.870 --> 00:23:08.610
And generally, you
find the issues, which

00:23:08.610 --> 00:23:11.840
are 10% of the total yields.

00:23:11.840 --> 00:23:14.430
So pay attention to
those, fixing those,

00:23:14.430 --> 00:23:16.490
and then ensuring that
you are ready to move

00:23:16.490 --> 00:23:17.900
onto the next stage.

00:23:17.900 --> 00:23:21.050
In terms of the cost
for a DVT platform--

00:23:21.050 --> 00:23:25.790
is about a few
percent more than EVT.

00:23:25.790 --> 00:23:28.040
The cost is, again,
driven by the cost

00:23:28.040 --> 00:23:30.710
of the board, the
components that you select,

00:23:30.710 --> 00:23:33.880
as well as the process
that you are using.

00:23:36.470 --> 00:23:39.710
Finally, PVT is the
Production Validation Test.

00:23:39.710 --> 00:23:42.360
This is generally in
thousands of units.

00:23:42.360 --> 00:23:45.560
And you need to ensure
that the manufacturing line

00:23:45.560 --> 00:23:49.430
that you have is set up to
handle the volumes that you're

00:23:49.430 --> 00:23:50.840
projecting.

00:23:50.840 --> 00:23:57.560
This validates that process
as part of this step.

00:23:57.560 --> 00:24:01.070
In terms of the issues
that you find-- are the 1%.

00:24:01.070 --> 00:24:03.840
Imagine now, you're
building thousands of units.

00:24:03.840 --> 00:24:06.320
And so you're going to
catch those small bugs that

00:24:06.320 --> 00:24:09.320
happen in the
hardware, which you

00:24:09.320 --> 00:24:12.050
wouldn't have found otherwise.

00:24:12.050 --> 00:24:14.180
The other focus is
really on ensuring

00:24:14.180 --> 00:24:17.990
that the process and the line
is set up to go really high.

00:24:17.990 --> 00:24:21.920
Cost-- the cost for
PVT is generally

00:24:21.920 --> 00:24:26.900
less than 1/2 or even 1/3
of what the cost of EVT is.

00:24:26.900 --> 00:24:29.900
This is really where the
high volume kicks in.

00:24:29.900 --> 00:24:34.084
Along with that, the tooling
is going to be hard-tooling.

00:24:34.084 --> 00:24:35.750
So that means that
you're going to start

00:24:35.750 --> 00:24:45.810
using a much better design
solution for your product.

00:24:45.810 --> 00:24:48.410
Finally, mass production--
mass production

00:24:48.410 --> 00:24:51.830
is where you are going to start
selling your units to your end

00:24:51.830 --> 00:24:53.130
customers.

00:24:53.130 --> 00:24:55.340
This is going to be
thousand of units.

00:24:55.340 --> 00:24:57.740
And this is where
you start, also,

00:24:57.740 --> 00:24:59.990
qualifying your
second sources, where

00:24:59.990 --> 00:25:04.850
you start adding new components
to your design to reduce cost.

00:25:04.850 --> 00:25:06.660
And the yields are
going to be critical.

00:25:06.660 --> 00:25:09.650
So pay attention to how
your product is performing

00:25:09.650 --> 00:25:12.680
in the factory, especially
for those small percentage

00:25:12.680 --> 00:25:15.650
of failures that you are seeing.

00:25:15.650 --> 00:25:20.030
This step is really where
the real cost comes in.

00:25:20.030 --> 00:25:22.550
This is generally, like
I said, less than 1/3

00:25:22.550 --> 00:25:25.340
of the cost of an
EVT or even lower.

00:25:25.340 --> 00:25:28.880
And you can further push
it by using second source,

00:25:28.880 --> 00:25:33.050
optimizing your
processes, even changing

00:25:33.050 --> 00:25:36.370
some of the design, in terms
of the components that you

00:25:36.370 --> 00:25:41.670
have selected, and reducing the
cost, or even removing them.

00:25:41.670 --> 00:25:43.670
Finally, you would
think you are done.

00:25:43.670 --> 00:25:45.830
Again-- not yet.

00:25:45.830 --> 00:25:48.890
There's a bunch
of tests that are

00:25:48.890 --> 00:25:52.100
required for you to meet
before you can ship out

00:25:52.100 --> 00:25:53.480
to your customers.

00:25:53.480 --> 00:25:57.440
And each country has its own
set of compliance tests--

00:25:57.440 --> 00:26:03.290
EMI and EMC tests, which
is critical to the product,

00:26:03.290 --> 00:26:05.810
and of course your
software qualification.

00:26:05.810 --> 00:26:11.470
So let's try to wrap this up.

00:26:14.320 --> 00:26:15.640
You did the planning.

00:26:15.640 --> 00:26:17.940
You did the prototype.

00:26:17.940 --> 00:26:20.290
You did the design.

00:26:20.290 --> 00:26:23.830
And then you did the qualify.

00:26:23.830 --> 00:26:27.400
These four steps
need to be repeated

00:26:27.400 --> 00:26:33.280
in each of these EVT, DVT, PVT
and mass production phases.

00:26:33.280 --> 00:26:35.800
And each of these
steps are designed

00:26:35.800 --> 00:26:39.380
to de-risk your hardware,
as I mentioned earlier.

00:26:39.380 --> 00:26:42.400
If you take these steps
and follow it through,

00:26:42.400 --> 00:26:44.920
most likely your
design will not have

00:26:44.920 --> 00:26:47.520
issues that would cost
thousands of dollars.

00:26:51.980 --> 00:26:54.570
That's the end of this talk.

00:26:54.570 --> 00:26:56.520
There are a bunch
of things around.

00:26:56.520 --> 00:26:59.210
If you haven't checked out
the Android Things demo,

00:26:59.210 --> 00:27:00.540
you can go check it out.

00:27:00.540 --> 00:27:02.640
There's Cold Labs.

00:27:02.640 --> 00:27:04.820
And there are also a
few other presentations

00:27:04.820 --> 00:27:10.430
from Android Things team
that you can check it out,

00:27:10.430 --> 00:27:11.540
and a scavenger hunt.

00:27:11.540 --> 00:27:14.330
If you haven't tried this
yet, you should try it.

00:27:14.330 --> 00:27:17.230
You can end up getting
your [INAUDIBLE]..

00:27:17.230 --> 00:27:20.820
And I would love to
get your feedback.

00:27:20.820 --> 00:27:21.638
Thank you.

00:27:21.638 --> 00:27:23.630
[APPLAUSE]

00:27:25.124 --> 00:27:28.864
