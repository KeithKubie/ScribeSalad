00:00:03.629 --> 00:00:07.960
Disney movies have brought us some of the
most amazing and iconic couples of all time.

00:00:07.960 --> 00:00:12.040
It seems like all of the Disney princesses
have found their perfect match and the world

00:00:12.040 --> 00:00:14.850
loves to love these inspiring stories.

00:00:14.850 --> 00:00:18.230
Disney fans are a very knowledgeable bunch,
but some of the princess couple facts that

00:00:18.230 --> 00:00:22.199
we have uncovered might surprise even the
most die-hard Disney lovers.

00:00:22.199 --> 00:00:26.840

Facts About DISNEY Princess Couples You May

00:00:26.840 --> 00:00:27.960

00:00:33.970 --> 00:00:36.680
Tangled
Tangled is one of Disney’s biggest hit movies

00:00:36.680 --> 00:00:38.020
in recent years.

00:00:38.020 --> 00:00:42.580
The film tells the timeless story of Rapunzel,
while adding in some new fun characters and

00:00:42.580 --> 00:00:43.610
plot points.

00:00:43.610 --> 00:00:47.620
One thing that audiences may not have realized
when watching Tangled however is that Rapunzel

00:00:47.620 --> 00:00:52.620
and her love interest, Flynn, have the largest
age gap of any of the Disney Princess couples.

00:00:52.620 --> 00:00:57.890
Rapunzel is 18 in the film and Flynn is 26,
giving them an eight-year difference.

00:00:57.890 --> 00:01:02.290
Disney probably made the right choice in making
Rapunzel an adult or else this whole situation

00:01:02.290 --> 00:01:03.739
could have become a little creepy.

00:01:03.739 --> 00:01:08.189
Regardless of their age gap, Flynn and Rapunzel
are a great Disney couple and prove to people

00:01:08.189 --> 00:01:17.329
that sometimes the heart just wants what it
wants.

00:01:17.329 --> 00:01:21.960
Hercules and The Little Mermaid
Hercules and Ariel are two of the most beloved

00:01:21.960 --> 00:01:26.780
characters in the Disney universe and fans
online have imagined them crossing over and

00:01:26.780 --> 00:01:28.429
even being a couple.

00:01:28.429 --> 00:01:31.219
Unfortunately, this would be a couple that
would be very creepy.

00:01:31.219 --> 00:01:35.289
In The Little Mermaid Ariel is the daughter
of Triton, who is the son of the great god

00:01:35.289 --> 00:01:36.289
Poseidon.

00:01:36.289 --> 00:01:39.320
Poseidon is the brother of Zeus, who is father
to Hercules.

00:01:39.320 --> 00:01:44.360
If you are able to follow that line, you quickly
realize that Hercules and Ariel are actually

00:01:44.360 --> 00:01:45.360
related.

00:01:45.360 --> 00:01:49.369
Unless Disney is planning on taking their
movies in a more Game Of Thrones style direction,

00:01:49.369 --> 00:01:56.119
we suggest that they do not pair up Hercules
and Ariel.

00:01:56.119 --> 00:02:02.630
Aladdin
Aladdin and Jasmine are one of the most interesting

00:02:02.630 --> 00:02:05.079
and entertaining Disney couples of all time.

00:02:05.079 --> 00:02:08.800
Their love story is a lot of fun and they
brought the world one of the most iconic love

00:02:08.800 --> 00:02:11.730
songs of all time while on their magic carpet
ride.

00:02:11.730 --> 00:02:15.080
Something that a lot of fans of the movie
may not know about these two is that Jasmine

00:02:15.080 --> 00:02:19.830
actually helped influence the design of Aladdin
during the earlier animation stages.

00:02:19.830 --> 00:02:23.060
Earlier sketches showed him seeming much younger
and scruffy.

00:02:23.060 --> 00:02:27.110
But once Jasmine was designed and looked absolutely
stunning, animators thought it wouldn’t

00:02:27.110 --> 00:02:30.500
be believable that she would go for someone
who looked like such a street rat.

00:02:30.500 --> 00:02:34.850
The movie is an amazing story of rags to riches,
but the animators decided that there was a

00:02:34.850 --> 00:02:43.260
limit to how “raggy” Aladdin could be.

00:02:43.260 --> 00:02:47.320
Sleeping Beauty and The Beast
By this point, it is pretty common knowledge

00:02:47.320 --> 00:02:51.440
that there are countless connections, references
and Easter eggs linking Disney’s movies

00:02:51.440 --> 00:02:52.800
to one and other.

00:02:52.800 --> 00:02:57.210
Fans love to look for these little gems, but
we doubt many people have the astute eye needed

00:02:57.210 --> 00:02:59.900
to connect Sleeping Beauty and Beauty and
the Beast.

00:02:59.900 --> 00:03:02.880
These two movies actually share a famous couple
scene.

00:03:02.880 --> 00:03:07.070
Belle’s iconic dance with the Beast was
actually created from the same animation cells

00:03:07.070 --> 00:03:08.950
as Aurora’s dance with the Prince.

00:03:08.950 --> 00:03:12.820
Apparently, the animators were running out
of time and needed to get the movie finished,

00:03:12.820 --> 00:03:16.090
so they just decided to borrow from some of
their earlier work.

00:03:16.090 --> 00:03:26.060
Some may call it plagiarism, but we’ll call
it a fun hidden secret!

00:03:26.060 --> 00:03:29.930
Pocahontas
For years and years Disney’s film Pocahontas

00:03:29.930 --> 00:03:34.340
has been criticized for its portrayal of history
and for fudging a lot of the details.

00:03:34.340 --> 00:03:38.600
One fact that Disney took some liberties with
was the age of Pocahontas in the movie.

00:03:38.600 --> 00:03:42.440
Disney decided to make her eighteen years
old but in real life, Pocahontas met John

00:03:42.440 --> 00:03:44.210
Smith at a much younger age.

00:03:44.210 --> 00:03:47.200
What was their justification for doing this?

00:03:47.200 --> 00:03:51.140
Disney has claimed that it was done to make
for a more dramatic and exciting story.

00:03:51.140 --> 00:03:55.500
That may be true, but are also guessing that
Pocahontas was aged to help keep away creepy

00:03:55.500 --> 00:03:56.690
vibes.

00:03:56.690 --> 00:04:00.760
Beauty and The Beast
Belle is often thought of as the great Disney

00:04:00.760 --> 00:04:04.870
princess of all time as she represents moral
goodness and true beauty all while showing

00:04:04.870 --> 00:04:06.990
off what it is like to be a flawed person.

00:04:06.990 --> 00:04:11.220
Her relationship with Beast is iconic and
we are excited to see Emma Watson take on

00:04:11.220 --> 00:04:13.000
the role in 2017.

00:04:13.000 --> 00:04:16.569
Something that fans may not know about Belle
is that she is the only person in her entire

00:04:16.569 --> 00:04:21.070
town to be seen wearing blue, which symbolizes
her position as an outsider to the rest of

00:04:21.070 --> 00:04:22.500
the characters in the film.

00:04:22.500 --> 00:04:27.190
Later on, Beast appears wearing blue as well,
signifying their union as a couple.

00:04:27.190 --> 00:04:36.470
This was a subtle and clever artistic choice
that really changes the way you see the movie!

00:04:36.470 --> 00:04:39.630
Brave
Brave was one Disney movie that took the world

00:04:39.630 --> 00:04:42.720
by surprise with its immense success and appreciation.

00:04:42.720 --> 00:04:47.530
The movie has been hailed as great and progressive
content and Merida quickly became a favorite

00:04:47.530 --> 00:04:48.790
Disney princess.

00:04:48.790 --> 00:04:52.490
The craziest couple fact from this Disney
flic is that there are none!

00:04:52.490 --> 00:04:57.030
Brave introduced Merida as the first Disney
Princess without a love interest in her film,

00:04:57.030 --> 00:04:58.030
letting her stand-alone.

00:04:58.030 --> 00:05:02.820
It’s crazy that it took until 2012 for that
to happen, but we imagine that as the world

00:05:02.820 --> 00:05:08.100
becomes more and more progressive, we will
see more characters like Merida!

00:05:08.100 --> 00:05:15.190
Mulan
Mulan is an absolutely epic Disney film and

00:05:15.190 --> 00:05:19.090
introduced the world to one of the most badass
Disney princesses of all time.

00:05:19.090 --> 00:05:23.150
One of the craziest things about Mulan, though,
is that she is actually the only Disney Princess

00:05:23.150 --> 00:05:25.830
that isn’t a literal princess by blood or
marriage.

00:05:25.830 --> 00:05:30.110
Mulan and her love interest Captain Li Shang
may be awesome and powerful, but they are

00:05:30.110 --> 00:05:31.440
not actually royalty.

00:05:31.440 --> 00:05:35.670
Regardless of her lineage however, we definitely
think that Mulan has earned her spot as an

00:05:35.670 --> 00:05:37.490
official Disney princess.

00:05:37.490 --> 00:05:41.080
Sleeping Beauty
Sleeping Beauty is probably one of the most

00:05:41.080 --> 00:05:44.800
famous and most bizarre Princesses on the
Disney roster.

00:05:44.800 --> 00:05:49.320
Princess Aurora only actually has 18 minutes
of screen time in the movie and oddly enough

00:05:49.320 --> 00:05:51.520
only speaks 18 lines of dialogue.

00:05:51.520 --> 00:05:56.150
She is basically defined by her relationship
with Prince Phillip so it makes why the actors

00:05:56.150 --> 00:06:00.660
Bill Shirley and Mary Costa auditioned together
for the two lead roles in the movie.

00:06:00.660 --> 00:06:04.750
They did this to ensure that their voices
complemented each other as the Prince and

00:06:04.750 --> 00:06:05.750
Princess.

00:06:05.750 --> 00:06:14.639
This clearly worked as Disney has immortalized
the characters forever.

00:06:14.639 --> 00:06:18.740
Frozen
Ever since Frozen was released in 2013, children

00:06:18.740 --> 00:06:23.580
and adult alike have been absolutely obsessed
with the film and it’s incredible songs.

00:06:23.580 --> 00:06:27.900
The movie is a genuine phenomenon and Elsa
and Anna have been welcomed into the official

00:06:27.900 --> 00:06:29.190
Disney Princess family.

00:06:29.190 --> 00:06:34.210
With all of the fuss usually being about Elsa
and Let It Go, it can be easy to forget about

00:06:34.210 --> 00:06:36.620
how interesting Anna is as a character.

00:06:36.620 --> 00:06:40.970
One crazy fact about Anna is that she is the
first Disney princess to ever sing a duet

00:06:40.970 --> 00:06:42.470
with the villain of the movie.

00:06:42.470 --> 00:06:45.851
Admittedly, Anna doesn’t know the truth
about Hans when they are singing “Love Is

00:06:45.851 --> 00:06:49.720
An Open Door” but when she looks back on
that duet, it might scare her.

00:06:49.720 --> 00:06:53.730
So there’s our list of 10 Disney princess
couple facts that may shock you!

00:06:53.730 --> 00:06:55.449
