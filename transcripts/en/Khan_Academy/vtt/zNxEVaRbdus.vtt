00:00:00.578 --> 00:00:02.586
Voiceover:Let's say that
we have the function

00:00:02.586 --> 00:00:06.333
F of X being defined by the
second degree polynomial,

00:00:06.333 --> 00:00:12.180
5 X squared plus 6 X plus 5.

00:00:12.180 --> 00:00:14.771
The fundamental theorem of algebra

00:00:14.771 --> 00:00:18.234
tells us that because this
is a second degree polynomial

00:00:18.234 --> 00:00:21.673
we are going to have exactly 2 roots.

00:00:21.673 --> 00:00:23.449
Or another way of thinking about it,

00:00:23.449 --> 00:00:25.649
there's exactly 2 values for X

00:00:25.649 --> 00:00:29.194
that will make F of X equal 0.

00:00:29.194 --> 00:00:31.038
So I encourage you to pause this video

00:00:31.038 --> 00:00:35.937
and try to figure out what
those 2 values of X are.

00:00:35.937 --> 00:00:37.921
So when I, if we're
looking for the X values,

00:00:37.921 --> 00:00:40.105
that would make this
expression equal to 0.

00:00:40.105 --> 00:00:42.745
That's essentially trying
to solve this equation.

00:00:42.745 --> 00:00:48.557
At 5 X squared plus 6
X plus 5 is equal to 0.

00:00:48.573 --> 00:00:50.998
And there's no obvious way I can think of

00:00:50.998 --> 00:00:52.829
factoring this right
over here so I'll just

00:00:52.829 --> 00:00:55.566
resort to the quadratic formula.

00:00:55.566 --> 00:00:58.766
So the quadratic formula tells us that X,

00:00:58.766 --> 00:01:00.886
where X is a solution to this equation,

00:01:00.886 --> 00:01:04.784
is going to be equal to negative B.

00:01:04.784 --> 00:01:06.558
I'll try to color code it.

00:01:06.558 --> 00:01:11.438
Negative B, this is right,
this is B right over here.

00:01:11.438 --> 00:01:16.022
Negative B, so negative 6, plus or minus,

00:01:16.022 --> 00:01:21.150
plus or minus the square
root of B squared,

00:01:21.150 --> 00:01:28.710
of B squared, minus 4 times A,

00:01:28.710 --> 00:01:37.094
times A, times C, times A times C.

00:01:37.094 --> 00:01:45.006
All of that, all of that over
all of that over 2 times A.

00:01:45.006 --> 00:01:48.614
All of that over 2 times A.

00:01:48.614 --> 00:01:50.334
So what does this simplify to?

00:01:50.334 --> 00:01:54.526
This is going to be equal
to so I'll go back to,

00:01:54.526 --> 00:01:58.326
this is going to be equal to negative 6.

00:01:58.326 --> 00:02:00.286
I'll try to keep it color coded still.

00:02:00.286 --> 00:02:05.558
Negative 6 plus or minus,
plus or minus the square root.

00:02:05.558 --> 00:02:06.854
Now, what is this going to be equal to?

00:02:06.854 --> 00:02:10.694
This is 36 minus 100.

00:02:10.694 --> 00:02:17.382
So negative 64 all of that over 2 times 5.

00:02:17.382 --> 00:02:19.710
All of that over 10.

00:02:19.710 --> 00:02:21.270
Now this is interesting.

00:02:21.270 --> 00:02:24.902
We are trying to take the square
root of a negative number.

00:02:24.902 --> 00:02:26.462
Or another way of thinking about it,

00:02:26.462 --> 00:02:31.038
B squared minus 4 A C is less than 0.

00:02:31.038 --> 00:02:35.790
B squared minus 4 A C which is often,

00:02:35.790 --> 00:02:40.542
often times called the
discriminant of this quadratic.

00:02:40.542 --> 00:02:43.598
This is less than 0.

00:02:43.598 --> 00:02:45.326
So this is less than 0.

00:02:45.326 --> 00:02:47.150
This part of the quadratic
formula we're going

00:02:47.150 --> 00:02:49.334
to try to take the square
root of a negative number.

00:02:49.334 --> 00:02:51.014
This is going to be a negative number.

00:02:51.014 --> 00:02:53.934
So we're going to result
in an imaginary number.

00:02:53.934 --> 00:02:57.462
So what that gives us
are not 2 real roots,

00:02:57.462 --> 00:03:00.510
but 2 non real complex roots.

00:03:00.510 --> 00:03:02.390
So this is going to be equal to

00:03:02.390 --> 00:03:08.334
negative 6 plus or minus 8 i,

00:03:08.334 --> 00:03:11.606
the square root of negative 64 is 8 i.

00:03:11.606 --> 00:03:15.070
If we extend the principle
square root function

00:03:15.070 --> 00:03:18.006
to imaginary numbers or complex numbers.

00:03:18.006 --> 00:03:20.191
All of that over 10.

00:03:20.191 --> 00:03:23.222
Or we could say X is equal to,

00:03:23.222 --> 00:03:26.342
let's see if we find a
greatest common divisor.

00:03:26.342 --> 00:03:28.686
If we try to reduce this,
so we're going to have

00:03:28.686 --> 00:03:30.446
let's see they're all divisible by 2

00:03:30.446 --> 00:03:33.606
so it's negative 3 over 5,
that's the same thing as

00:03:33.606 --> 00:03:41.102
negative 6 over 10, plus or
minus 4 over 5, 4 over 5 i.

00:03:41.102 --> 00:03:43.230
Or you could say that the 2 roots,

00:03:43.230 --> 00:03:45.730
which are non real complex roots,

00:03:45.730 --> 00:03:51.534
so it's X is equal to
negative 3/5 plus 4/5 i,

00:03:51.534 --> 00:03:52.606
that's one of the roots.

00:03:52.606 --> 00:03:54.198
And then the other root is X

00:03:54.198 --> 00:03:58.886
is equal to negative 3/5 minus 4/5 i.

00:03:58.886 --> 00:04:02.741
Notice, we satisfied the
fundamental theorem of algebra.

00:04:02.741 --> 00:04:05.158
We have 2 roots, they're non real,

00:04:05.158 --> 00:04:06.494
but the fundamental theorem of algebra

00:04:06.494 --> 00:04:07.830
says, "hey look we're just going to have

00:04:07.830 --> 00:04:10.297
"at least if we're Nth degree polynomial,

00:04:10.297 --> 00:04:12.298
"we're going to have n complex roots."

00:04:12.298 --> 00:04:15.098
They could be real or
they could be non real

00:04:15.098 --> 00:04:16.266
and we see that right over there.

00:04:16.266 --> 00:04:18.250
And we also see that they are conjugates.

00:04:18.250 --> 00:04:19.762
And the quadratic formula kinda

00:04:19.762 --> 00:04:21.867
sets up a situation where we are,

00:04:21.867 --> 00:04:24.778
especially if this ends
up being less than 0

00:04:24.778 --> 00:04:26.707
and so this when you take the square root

00:04:26.707 --> 00:04:28.322
you get an imaginary number

00:04:28.322 --> 00:04:30.994
you see where those conjugates appear.

00:04:30.994 --> 00:04:33.802
Now let's verify graphically
that this is indeed the case.

00:04:33.802 --> 00:04:36.490
That this does not have any real roots.

00:04:36.490 --> 00:04:39.050
So let's get a calculator out.

00:04:39.050 --> 00:04:41.506
So let me go into graph mode.

00:04:41.506 --> 00:04:43.482
So Y is equal to.

00:04:43.482 --> 00:04:45.898
Let me clear what I must have
been doing out here before.

00:04:45.898 --> 00:04:50.206
So Y1 is equal to 5 times X squared,

00:04:50.206 --> 00:04:55.690
plus 6 X plus 5 and then let me

00:04:55.690 --> 00:04:58.850
set a reasonable range here.

00:04:58.850 --> 00:05:00.322
So I don't know.

00:05:00.322 --> 00:05:02.498
Actually, I know very little
about this function right over.

00:05:02.498 --> 00:05:06.242
So I'm going to set minimum
range at a negative 10,

00:05:06.242 --> 00:05:09.202
X max I don't know positive 10.

00:05:09.202 --> 00:05:12.098
X scale is 1, let's see Y max let's see,

00:05:12.098 --> 00:05:15.994
this thing actually does
get pretty big pretty fast.

00:05:15.994 --> 00:05:20.253
So let's say Y max is and the Y scale,

00:05:20.253 --> 00:05:22.586
I don't know I'll say 100.

00:05:22.586 --> 00:05:25.738
100, the scale I'll make it 10.

00:05:25.738 --> 00:05:27.690
Each of those notches are going to be 10.

00:05:27.690 --> 00:05:30.314
Y minimum, we want to see the X axis

00:05:30.314 --> 00:05:34.004
to make sure it doesn't cross
it so let's go at negative,

00:05:34.004 --> 00:05:36.482
I don't know, negative 20.

00:05:36.482 --> 00:05:37.850
And now let's graph this.

00:05:37.850 --> 00:05:40.738
I'm hoping that I've actually
captured it and I have.

00:05:40.738 --> 00:05:42.714
So there you have it, you see that

00:05:42.714 --> 00:05:45.802
this thing does not intersect the X-axis.

00:05:45.802 --> 00:05:49.931
And in fact, we could,
we could zoom in on it.

00:05:49.931 --> 00:05:52.251
Let's see it's a little bit
hard to, it's a little actually,

00:05:52.251 --> 00:05:55.747
let me just change the range a little bit.

00:05:55.747 --> 00:05:57.803
So let me just change the range.

00:05:57.803 --> 00:06:02.115
So let's make our X min, let's make it 5,

00:06:02.115 --> 00:06:07.619
let's make our X max, whoops
not 50, let's make that 5.

00:06:07.619 --> 00:06:11.227
And let's make, negative 5 and positive 5.

00:06:11.227 --> 00:06:15.627
And let's see, let's make our Y max,

00:06:15.627 --> 00:06:20.340
let's make our Y max equal
to 20 and then our Y scale,

00:06:20.340 --> 00:06:21.901
I don't know we could make it 2.

00:06:21.901 --> 00:06:24.132
Okay I think this will
get us much closer in,

00:06:24.132 --> 00:06:28.004
there we see, it does
not intersect the X axis.

00:06:28.004 --> 00:06:30.177
This does not have any real roots

00:06:30.177 --> 23:59:59.999
but it has 2 non real complex roots.
