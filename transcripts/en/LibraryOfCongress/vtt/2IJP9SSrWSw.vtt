00:00:14.070 --> 00:00:15.370
&gt;&gt; Stephanie Marcus: Good
morning, I'm Stephanie Marcus

00:00:15.370 --> 00:00:16.670
from the Science, Technology,

00:00:16.670 --> 00:00:18.440
and Business Division
here at the library.

00:00:18.440 --> 00:00:20.150
Welcome to our lecture today.

00:00:20.150 --> 00:00:22.630
We're going to come
back to the home planet.

00:00:22.630 --> 00:00:25.460
And today we have
Dr. Tom Neumann,

00:00:25.460 --> 00:00:28.370
who's the deputy
project scientist

00:00:28.370 --> 00:00:31.470
for the ICESat-2 Mission.

00:00:31.470 --> 00:00:33.620
So we got the right guy.

00:00:33.620 --> 00:00:36.400
And he's accompanied by Adriana,

00:00:36.400 --> 00:00:40.450
one of his assistants
today, so welcome to her.

00:00:40.450 --> 00:00:44.300
Dr. Neumann taught at
the University of Vermont

00:00:44.300 --> 00:00:47.620
and did some ice and snow
projects that were funded

00:00:47.620 --> 00:00:50.050
by the National Science
Foundation and NASA.

00:00:50.050 --> 00:00:54.200
And then he came
to NASA in 2008.

00:00:54.200 --> 00:00:58.560
He got his BA in Geophysical
Science from the University

00:00:58.560 --> 00:01:01.830
of Chicago and a
Ph.D. in Geophysics

00:01:01.830 --> 00:01:04.530
from the University
of Washington.

00:01:04.530 --> 00:01:07.610
He's spent a good deal
of time in the cryosphere

00:01:07.610 --> 00:01:11.670
and somewhat recently,
made a 470 mile trek

00:01:11.670 --> 00:01:14.650
across Antarctica
with three others.

00:01:14.650 --> 00:01:17.160
I've read that he
also plays guitar

00:01:17.160 --> 00:01:21.550
with other ice scientists, so
that sounds very interesting.

00:01:21.550 --> 00:01:24.220
[laughter] And [laughs] I
do hope he flavors his talk

00:01:24.220 --> 00:01:28.850
with some tidbits about the
expeditions and the ice band.

00:01:28.850 --> 00:01:30.850
I'm also happy to announce

00:01:30.850 --> 00:01:33.810
that Dr. Neumann did some
research here at the Library

00:01:33.810 --> 00:01:35.740
of Congress a while back,

00:01:35.740 --> 00:01:37.550
so please help me welcome
him back to the library.

00:01:37.550 --> 00:01:39.350
Thank you.

00:01:39.350 --> 00:01:44.930
[ Applause ]

00:01:44.930 --> 00:01:46.230
&gt;&gt; Dr. Tom Neumann: Great.

00:01:46.230 --> 00:01:47.530
Thank you much.

00:01:47.530 --> 00:01:48.830
I did, in fact, come
to do some research.

00:01:48.830 --> 00:01:53.850
When I was at Vermont, I was
there from 2001 to about 2008,

00:01:53.850 --> 00:01:56.250
and their geology program
there is pretty small.

00:01:56.250 --> 00:01:59.450
I was in the geology department,
and I was the only ice person.

00:01:59.450 --> 00:02:02.900
[laughter] So I mean, the
number of journals they had,

00:02:02.900 --> 00:02:06.000
things weren't online as
readily as they are now,

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:07.900
and so I would put
together a list

00:02:07.900 --> 00:02:09.770
of articles I just
couldn't find anywhere else.

00:02:09.770 --> 00:02:12.100
And I had a brother who
lived in Alexandria.

00:02:12.100 --> 00:02:14.980
I'd come to visit a day early,
and I'd spend the day --

00:02:14.980 --> 00:02:16.400
spend the day getting articles.

00:02:16.400 --> 00:02:18.170
It was -- yeah, it was awesome.

00:02:18.170 --> 00:02:20.590
It's sort of funny that
I had my little Library

00:02:20.590 --> 00:02:23.920
of Congress library card,
and I'd tell people,

00:02:23.920 --> 00:02:25.220
I went to the Library
of Congress.

00:02:25.220 --> 00:02:26.520
They're like, is
that a real library?

00:02:26.520 --> 00:02:29.490
I'm like, it's an -- [laughter]
It's an unbelievable library.

00:02:29.490 --> 00:02:31.810
You can get anything
you want there.

00:02:31.810 --> 00:02:34.020
[laughter] Journals
from anything.

00:02:34.020 --> 00:02:35.320
But mostly what I'm
going to talk

00:02:35.320 --> 00:02:36.620
about today is not the ice band.

00:02:36.620 --> 00:02:39.010
I'll maybe touch on it at the
end if people are interested.

00:02:39.010 --> 00:02:40.590
And I do have some
field pictures.

00:02:40.590 --> 00:02:43.420
But most of what I'm going
to talk about is ICESat-2.

00:02:43.420 --> 00:02:45.290
That's the project I work on.

00:02:45.290 --> 00:02:47.840
NASA has just recently
launched two missions

00:02:47.840 --> 00:02:49.910
to study the cryosphere,
ICESat-2,

00:02:49.910 --> 00:02:51.560
and the other one
being GRACE-Follow-On.

00:02:51.560 --> 00:02:53.570
I'll talk just a bit
about GRACE-Follow-On.

00:02:53.570 --> 00:02:54.930
But mostly you'll
hear about ICESat-2,

00:02:54.930 --> 00:02:57.840
since that's what I know best.

00:02:57.840 --> 00:02:59.250
So the polar regions.

00:02:59.250 --> 00:03:02.150
We use words like the "polar
regions of the cryosphere,"

00:03:02.150 --> 00:03:04.080
so I wanted to just have a
couple slides at the beginning

00:03:04.080 --> 00:03:07.770
to put us all in the same page
about what we're talking about.

00:03:07.770 --> 00:03:11.440
There's two main pieces
to the cryosphere.

00:03:11.440 --> 00:03:13.800
Once is glaciers and ice sheets,

00:03:13.800 --> 00:03:15.700
and they're formed
by accumulating snow.

00:03:15.700 --> 00:03:17.460
It's so cold in Antarctica
and Greenland

00:03:17.460 --> 00:03:19.060
that it rarely melts very much,

00:03:19.060 --> 00:03:21.160
and so snow just
accumulated year after year,

00:03:21.160 --> 00:03:23.860
decade after decade,
thousands of years at a time.

00:03:23.860 --> 00:03:25.190
It doesn't snow very
much down there.

00:03:25.190 --> 00:03:26.900
It's a polar desert.

00:03:26.900 --> 00:03:29.430
But it doesn't melt,
so it just builds up.

00:03:29.430 --> 00:03:32.620
These ice sheets can
be 4,000 meters thick.

00:03:32.620 --> 00:03:35.060
You might have heard about
ice coring projects that drill

00:03:35.060 --> 00:03:39.180
down through the ice sheets
to collect ice that fell

00:03:39.180 --> 00:03:41.240
as snow tens of thousands
or hundreds

00:03:41.240 --> 00:03:42.800
of thousands of years ago.

00:03:42.800 --> 00:03:44.800
That's the kind of
place they come from.

00:03:44.800 --> 00:03:46.100
They move.

00:03:46.100 --> 00:03:47.400
They move really slowly though.

00:03:47.400 --> 00:03:50.790
They deform under gravity,
just like pancake batter.

00:03:50.790 --> 00:03:52.090
When you pour it on the pan,

00:03:52.090 --> 00:03:53.770
it kind of slides
out towards the edge.

00:03:53.770 --> 00:03:56.340
But they don't move
very quickly.

00:03:56.340 --> 00:03:57.640
In the middle of the ice sheet,

00:03:57.640 --> 00:04:01.160
it might move just a few
meters a year, sometimes less.

00:04:01.160 --> 00:04:03.280
They lose mass.

00:04:03.280 --> 00:04:04.900
So they gain mass by snow fall.

00:04:04.900 --> 00:04:08.510
They lose mass by
generally calving icebergs

00:04:08.510 --> 00:04:10.030
at the edges of Antarctica.

00:04:10.030 --> 00:04:12.790
Whenever there's a big one, it
always seems to make the news.

00:04:12.790 --> 00:04:15.790
Recently there was a square
one somebody took a picture of,

00:04:15.790 --> 00:04:17.270
and so we got phone calls
about, what do you think

00:04:17.270 --> 00:04:18.570
about this square iceberg.

00:04:18.570 --> 00:04:20.060
And I'm like, it's square?

00:04:20.060 --> 00:04:21.930
I mean, what do you
want me to say?

00:04:21.930 --> 00:04:23.950
[laughter] It's a
thing that happens.

00:04:23.950 --> 00:04:27.020
In Greenland, it's warmer,
so actually about half

00:04:27.020 --> 00:04:28.600
of the mass lost
there is due to melt.

00:04:28.600 --> 00:04:32.370
So the iceberg that sank the
Titanic almost certainly came

00:04:32.370 --> 00:04:34.810
from Greenland, and
it does calve,

00:04:34.810 --> 00:04:37.500
but it also melts
quite a lot down there.

00:04:37.500 --> 00:04:38.800
The other main piece

00:04:38.800 --> 00:04:40.620
of the cryosphere we'll
talk about is sea ice.

00:04:40.620 --> 00:04:43.560
Now, sea ice is different
than glaciers or ice sheets.

00:04:43.560 --> 00:04:46.500
Sea ice is formed by
freezing of ocean water.

00:04:46.500 --> 00:04:50.080
So the air temperature
gets cold, that will freeze

00:04:50.080 --> 00:04:51.510
that top layer of water,

00:04:51.510 --> 00:04:54.640
just like you might see a
frozen lake or a frozen pond.

00:04:54.640 --> 00:04:57.610
But in the ocean, it's
much more dynamic.

00:04:57.610 --> 00:05:00.500
There's tides, there's
wind, there's waves.

00:05:00.500 --> 00:05:03.470
And so the sea ice moves
around quite a lot.

00:05:03.470 --> 00:05:06.540
It's much thinner than glaciers.

00:05:06.540 --> 00:05:10.680
It only, at its maximum, gets up
to about 20 meters or so thick.

00:05:10.680 --> 00:05:13.390
In the upper left, you can see
there's some really freshly

00:05:13.390 --> 00:05:15.360
formed sea ice and
the wind has caused it

00:05:15.360 --> 00:05:17.230
to raft on top of each other.

00:05:17.230 --> 00:05:20.620
You see -- if I can get
my pointer going here --

00:05:20.620 --> 00:05:22.470
see areas where it's
overlapping.

00:05:22.470 --> 00:05:25.130
You see places where there's
open water between it.

00:05:25.130 --> 00:05:29.230
And if that sea ice is
allowed to continue to grow,

00:05:29.230 --> 00:05:31.870
it'll start to collect
snow fall on top of it,

00:05:31.870 --> 00:05:35.100
and so that surface will turn
from a dark or translucent

00:05:35.100 --> 00:05:39.170
to a bright white, as it
collects snow on top of it.

00:05:39.170 --> 00:05:40.560
Sea ice melts seasonally.

00:05:40.560 --> 00:05:43.980
When the weather gets warm
in the Artic or Antarctic,

00:05:43.980 --> 00:05:46.920
sea ice extent shrinks and then
it grows again the next fall

00:05:46.920 --> 00:05:48.220
and winter.

00:05:48.220 --> 00:05:52.260
And it pretty much forms --
well, anywhere it's cold enough

00:05:52.260 --> 00:05:55.520
to freeze the water, so places
like Hudson Bay get sea ice.

00:05:55.520 --> 00:05:59.030
A few years ago, the Great Lakes
froze over almost entirely.

00:05:59.030 --> 00:06:00.330
Of course, they're freshwater,

00:06:00.330 --> 00:06:01.880
so they have a different
freezing point.

00:06:01.880 --> 00:06:06.010
But around the Arctic Ocean and
around the Antarctic continent,

00:06:06.010 --> 00:06:08.080
you get sea ice annually.

00:06:08.080 --> 00:06:10.920
So those are the two terms
I'm going to end up using

00:06:10.920 --> 00:06:12.770
that I wanted to
make sure I defined.

00:06:12.770 --> 00:06:17.010
So why is NASA interested
in these kind of areas?

00:06:17.010 --> 00:06:20.830
You might know that places
like Greenland are losing mass.

00:06:20.830 --> 00:06:23.150
The Greenland ice sheet
is getting smaller.

00:06:23.150 --> 00:06:26.600
And what we've learned over the
last 10 years or so is that most

00:06:26.600 --> 00:06:28.070
of that mass lost from Greenland

00:06:28.070 --> 00:06:30.230
or from Antarctica
is concentrated

00:06:30.230 --> 00:06:32.210
at the edges of the ice sheet.

00:06:32.210 --> 00:06:33.510
Now, it turns out
these are the places

00:06:33.510 --> 00:06:35.990
where ocean interacts
with the ice sheets.

00:06:35.990 --> 00:06:39.940
These glaciers tend to terminate
in water, in the ocean water.

00:06:39.940 --> 00:06:42.580
So as ocean water gets
just a little bit warmer,

00:06:42.580 --> 00:06:44.570
that's a large amount
of heat that's available

00:06:44.570 --> 00:06:46.740
for melting more ice.

00:06:46.740 --> 00:06:48.380
So this is a map of Greenland

00:06:48.380 --> 00:06:50.350
and where we've seen
changes there.

00:06:50.350 --> 00:06:53.930
In Antarctic, here's
a time series

00:06:53.930 --> 00:06:56.500
from a mission called "GRACE."

00:06:56.500 --> 00:06:59.790
And what GRACE does is it
measures the mass change

00:06:59.790 --> 00:07:01.630
of the whole ice sheet,
and I'll talk about that

00:07:01.630 --> 00:07:02.960
in a little more detail.

00:07:02.960 --> 00:07:05.210
But the take-away here
is that through time --

00:07:05.210 --> 00:07:08.120
so you can see time
marching forward here --

00:07:08.120 --> 00:07:11.720
you can look at the record of
mass loss measured by GRACE.

00:07:11.720 --> 00:07:14.050
Most of the loss is
here in West Antarctica.

00:07:14.050 --> 00:07:16.520
You might have heard about
places like Pine Island Glacier

00:07:16.520 --> 00:07:19.390
or Thwaites Glacier
that are losing mass.

00:07:19.390 --> 00:07:23.870
And that's a place where
the ocean water contacts the

00:07:23.870 --> 00:07:25.170
ice sheet.

00:07:25.170 --> 00:07:26.470
So as that ocean water
warms just a little bit,

00:07:26.470 --> 00:07:28.700
it has a big impact
on the ice sheet.

00:07:28.700 --> 00:07:30.860
So this place over here
is called West Antarctica.

00:07:30.860 --> 00:07:32.790
This little thumb
is the peninsula.

00:07:32.790 --> 00:07:35.460
And the bigger piece
here is East Antarctica.

00:07:35.460 --> 00:07:38.310
East Antarctica is probably
three-quarters or so

00:07:38.310 --> 00:07:41.480
of the total amount
of ice in Antarctica.

00:07:41.480 --> 00:07:45.930
And it doesn't change nearly as
quickly as West Antarctica does.

00:07:45.930 --> 00:07:49.190
So that's one reason
why NASA is interested,

00:07:49.190 --> 00:07:51.590
because these ice
sheets are changing

00:07:51.590 --> 00:07:55.700
and they're losing mass,
and that mass, that water,

00:07:55.700 --> 00:07:57.350
when it leaves the ice
sheet, it just goes back

00:07:57.350 --> 00:07:58.650
into the world's oceans.

00:07:58.650 --> 00:08:00.670
And that's one of
the main contributors

00:08:00.670 --> 00:08:02.350
to global sea level rise.

00:08:02.350 --> 00:08:05.030
You took ice that used to be
sitting on rock in Antarctica

00:08:05.030 --> 00:08:08.080
or Greenland, you put the
ice cubes back in the water,

00:08:08.080 --> 00:08:10.670
and they're going
to raise sea level.

00:08:10.670 --> 00:08:13.390
So that's one of the main
reasons NASA's interested.

00:08:13.390 --> 00:08:16.530
For sea ice, if I can
get this guy to play.

00:08:16.530 --> 00:08:20.120
We talked about how sea
ice is pretty dynamic.

00:08:20.120 --> 00:08:24.380
And in this animation, you
see time marching past up here

00:08:24.380 --> 00:08:26.910
in the upper left,
and these are images

00:08:26.910 --> 00:08:28.860
of the sea ice extent
in the Arctic Ocean.

00:08:28.860 --> 00:08:32.260
You can see Greenland over here,
Alaska over here, Canada here.

00:08:32.260 --> 00:08:33.560
And this should give you a sense

00:08:33.560 --> 00:08:35.720
for just how dynamic
that sea ice is.

00:08:35.720 --> 00:08:39.510
It grows and shrinks annually,
and when storms come through,

00:08:39.510 --> 00:08:41.130
it moves it quite a lot.

00:08:41.130 --> 00:08:43.680
You can see it generally tends
to form over in this part

00:08:43.680 --> 00:08:46.840
of the basin and is lost
right down the coast

00:08:46.840 --> 00:08:48.140
of Greenland over here.

00:08:48.140 --> 00:08:50.810
You also lose some
over in this area.

00:08:50.810 --> 00:08:55.430
And we've been able to take
pictures of sea ice extent

00:08:55.430 --> 00:08:57.740
from imagers, since about 1979.

00:08:57.740 --> 00:09:00.240
So that's how we put
together this time series

00:09:00.240 --> 00:09:03.040
of how the extent
has been changing.

00:09:03.040 --> 00:09:04.540
Now, one of the things
we're really interested

00:09:04.540 --> 00:09:07.140
in is how the thickness
of sea ice changes.

00:09:07.140 --> 00:09:09.170
Really thick sea ice,
it's hard to break up.

00:09:09.170 --> 00:09:12.130
It lasts much longer
than very thin sea ice.

00:09:12.130 --> 00:09:15.190
If it's first-year sea ice,
you have a storm come through,

00:09:15.190 --> 00:09:17.460
it can break up that ice.

00:09:17.460 --> 00:09:20.000
And what happens when
you lose sea ice is

00:09:20.000 --> 00:09:23.250
that it increases
the transfer of heat

00:09:23.250 --> 00:09:25.710
from the ocean to
the atmosphere.

00:09:25.710 --> 00:09:29.030
And you say, all right, well,
why would we care about that?

00:09:29.030 --> 00:09:31.430
It turns out that the
exchange of heat from the ocean

00:09:31.430 --> 00:09:33.460
to the atmosphere in the
Arctic is one of the big things

00:09:33.460 --> 00:09:35.620
that drives climate patterns

00:09:35.620 --> 00:09:37.280
and weather patterns
around the world.

00:09:37.280 --> 00:09:39.550
Things like the jet stream
position is influenced

00:09:39.550 --> 00:09:41.720
by the heat exchange up here.

00:09:41.720 --> 00:09:46.300
Whether we have a snowier winter
here in D.C. is determined,

00:09:46.300 --> 00:09:49.080
in part, by the state of
the sea ice in the Arctic.

00:09:49.080 --> 00:09:50.380
So that's really a driver

00:09:50.380 --> 00:09:52.220
for weather patterns
around the world.

00:09:52.220 --> 00:09:55.360
So the more we can understand
about how it grows in shrinks,

00:09:55.360 --> 00:09:56.910
including the thickness,
the better.

00:09:56.910 --> 00:10:00.780
Oop -- and I'm going
to go to the next one.

00:10:00.780 --> 00:10:02.080
There we go.

00:10:02.080 --> 00:10:05.390
So if we just look at the area
of Arctic sea ice in September

00:10:05.390 --> 00:10:07.170
of every year, we can
make a time series

00:10:07.170 --> 00:10:08.970
for how the extent has changed.

00:10:08.970 --> 00:10:11.250
We've picked September because
that's basically the end

00:10:11.250 --> 00:10:13.260
of the summer season
in the Arctic.

00:10:13.260 --> 00:10:16.220
You get into October, it gets
cold, sea ice starts to regrow.

00:10:16.220 --> 00:10:17.850
So what we're looking
at here is a graph

00:10:17.850 --> 00:10:20.090
of the minimum sea ice
extent in the Arctic.

00:10:20.090 --> 00:10:22.520
It's usually about the
second week of September.

00:10:22.520 --> 00:10:25.620
And what you can see is
that since 1979 here,

00:10:25.620 --> 00:10:27.890
it was kind of flat
for a most of the '80s,

00:10:27.890 --> 00:10:29.190
but you get into the '90s

00:10:29.190 --> 00:10:30.910
and you get bigger
and bigger changes.

00:10:30.910 --> 00:10:32.210
And now we're -- oop.

00:10:32.210 --> 00:10:33.510
I should put the new one in.

00:10:33.510 --> 00:10:34.810
Now we're out here in 2016,

00:10:34.810 --> 00:10:36.600
there's actually two more
data points on there.

00:10:36.600 --> 00:10:40.080
It's a lot smaller than
it was back in the '80s.

00:10:40.080 --> 00:10:41.700
And remember, this
is the extent.

00:10:41.700 --> 00:10:43.490
This doesn't tell us
anything about the thickness

00:10:43.490 --> 00:10:44.790
or the stability of it.

00:10:44.790 --> 00:10:47.050
It's just how much was there.

00:10:47.050 --> 00:10:49.710
The mission I work on is called
ICESat-2 and it's designed

00:10:49.710 --> 00:10:52.760
to measure that thickness
of the sea ice.

00:10:52.760 --> 00:10:55.920
In the Antarctic, the
seas around the Antarctic,

00:10:55.920 --> 00:10:58.190
the changes are much
more subtle.

00:10:58.190 --> 00:11:00.780
The graph up here is the
change in the Arctic,

00:11:00.780 --> 00:11:02.120
which we just saw a moment ago.

00:11:02.120 --> 00:11:03.770
For the Antarctic,
it's pretty flat.

00:11:03.770 --> 00:11:05.180
It might be increasing
a little bit.

00:11:05.180 --> 00:11:06.550
You can see there's
been this change

00:11:06.550 --> 00:11:08.120
in about the last
four or five years.

00:11:08.120 --> 00:11:10.220
It's hard to know if
that's something permanent

00:11:10.220 --> 00:11:11.540
or short-term.

00:11:11.540 --> 00:11:15.820
But at least since the early
'80s, since 1980 or so,

00:11:15.820 --> 00:11:17.670
Antarctic extent has
been pretty flat.

00:11:17.670 --> 00:11:22.740
The Arctic has been losing
sea ice area over time.

00:11:22.740 --> 00:11:24.160
So that's why NASA's interested.

00:11:24.160 --> 00:11:25.460
One of their mandates is

00:11:25.460 --> 00:11:27.760
to understand the
planet we live on, Earth,

00:11:27.760 --> 00:11:31.740
and the cryosphere is
a big piece of that.

00:11:31.740 --> 00:11:33.540
So as I mentioned, we
have two new missions

00:11:33.540 --> 00:11:35.110
to study the cryosphere.

00:11:35.110 --> 00:11:37.540
GRACE-Follow-On, its launch
is up here in the upper left,

00:11:37.540 --> 00:11:39.480
launched in May of this year.

00:11:39.480 --> 00:11:43.310
And the mission I work on,
ICESat-2, just launched about --

00:11:43.310 --> 00:11:45.290
not even two months ago.

00:11:45.290 --> 00:11:47.110
We launched in the
early morning hours,

00:11:47.110 --> 00:11:50.450
so we had a really nice
view of the rocket.

00:11:50.450 --> 00:11:53.130
GRACE-Follow-On launched
in the afternoon.

00:11:53.130 --> 00:11:54.430
Both from the West Coast,

00:11:54.430 --> 00:11:57.630
Vandenberg Air Force
Base out in California.

00:12:00.060 --> 00:12:01.360
So GRACE-Follow-On.

00:12:01.360 --> 00:12:02.720
As you might imagine
from the name,

00:12:02.720 --> 00:12:04.420
there was an original
mission called GRACE.

00:12:04.420 --> 00:12:05.920
We saw some of its data earlier.

00:12:05.920 --> 00:12:08.270
This is the Follow-On
mission to that.

00:12:08.270 --> 00:12:11.100
And GRACE and GRACE-Follow-On
are composed of two satellites.

00:12:11.100 --> 00:12:12.400
You can see the one
in the foreground,

00:12:12.400 --> 00:12:14.680
and there's another one way
off here in the background.

00:12:14.680 --> 00:12:17.850
And what the mission does
is it measures the distance

00:12:17.850 --> 00:12:20.970
between those two
satellites very accurately.

00:12:20.970 --> 00:12:23.320
It uses microwave
ranging between them.

00:12:23.320 --> 00:12:26.600
So it can range to better a
millimeter how far apart these

00:12:26.600 --> 00:12:28.150
two satellites are.

00:12:28.150 --> 00:12:31.480
And the way it works is that
as the lead satellite goes

00:12:31.480 --> 00:12:34.190
over a place in the earth
that has relatively more mass

00:12:34.190 --> 00:12:37.450
or less mass, it experiences
a slight acceleration

00:12:37.450 --> 00:12:39.290
and it moves a little
farther away

00:12:39.290 --> 00:12:41.070
from the trailing satellite.

00:12:41.070 --> 00:12:42.910
Now, when the trailing
satellite gets up to that place

00:12:42.910 --> 00:12:45.620
where there's a little more
mass, it also accelerates,

00:12:45.620 --> 00:12:48.990
and so the distance
between the two is a measure

00:12:48.990 --> 00:12:53.000
of how much mass difference
there is in the earth.

00:12:53.000 --> 00:12:56.560
So over Antarctica, when the
Antarctic ice sheet is losing

00:12:56.560 --> 00:13:00.990
mass, we compile data
from many passes of GRACE

00:13:00.990 --> 00:13:04.460
over the same places in
Antarctica to determine,

00:13:04.460 --> 00:13:06.550
is it gaining mass
or is it losing mass?

00:13:06.550 --> 00:13:08.740
Is the front satellite
accelerating just a little bit

00:13:08.740 --> 00:13:10.700
more than it was last time,
or maybe a little less

00:13:10.700 --> 00:13:12.880
than it was last time?

00:13:12.880 --> 00:13:16.220
GRACE was mainly designed to
study the hydrologic cycle.

00:13:16.220 --> 00:13:19.820
It can do things like
measure aquifers.

00:13:19.820 --> 00:13:22.350
Are we losing water out of
aquifers or are we gaining it?

00:13:22.350 --> 00:13:24.810
Is there more mass here,
is there less mass here?

00:13:24.810 --> 00:13:27.290
It can measure changes
in seasonal snow,

00:13:27.290 --> 00:13:31.470
which is totally cool, because
you get a big snowfall here

00:13:31.470 --> 00:13:33.740
and you could measure
that in GRACE data.

00:13:33.740 --> 00:13:35.990
So what GRACE is doing
is measuring mass

00:13:35.990 --> 00:13:38.150
changes primarily.

00:13:38.150 --> 00:13:43.140
Given that, it's on orbit 350
kilometers above the surface

00:13:43.140 --> 00:13:46.860
of the earth and these two
satellites are hundreds

00:13:46.860 --> 00:13:48.280
of kilometers apart.

00:13:48.280 --> 00:13:51.380
You end up with a pretty low
spatial resolution measurement.

00:13:51.380 --> 00:13:54.390
And what I mean by that is you
can measure mass changes really

00:13:54.390 --> 00:13:56.320
accurately, but only an average

00:13:56.320 --> 00:13:59.340
over hundreds of
square kilometers.

00:13:59.340 --> 00:14:01.730
So it's an average
over a big area.

00:14:01.730 --> 00:14:04.780
However, given its orbit, you
get a lot of data through time.

00:14:04.780 --> 00:14:06.460
So you can get a data
point over a place

00:14:06.460 --> 00:14:08.920
about once a month,
which is great.

00:14:08.920 --> 00:14:11.640
We saw that time series earlier
of mass change in Antarctica

00:14:11.640 --> 00:14:14.740
from GRACE and that was a data
point about once every month.

00:14:14.740 --> 00:14:17.910
GRACE and GRACE-Follow-On are
by NASA's Jet Propulsion Lab

00:14:17.910 --> 00:14:22.000
out in Pasadena, California,
and that's all I'm going to say

00:14:22.000 --> 00:14:25.030
about GRACE, because I work at
one of the other NASA centers,

00:14:25.030 --> 00:14:26.930
right out here in Maryland,

00:14:26.930 --> 00:14:29.520
NASA's Goddard Space
Flight Center.

00:14:29.520 --> 00:14:32.740
And we recently launched
ICESat-2.

00:14:32.740 --> 00:14:35.850
Now, at ICESat-2, as you might
imagine, is also a follow-on.

00:14:35.850 --> 00:14:38.120
There was a first
ICESat mission,

00:14:38.120 --> 00:14:39.420
although it'd be pretty bold

00:14:39.420 --> 00:14:42.150
to name your first mission
ICESat-2, just to mix it

00:14:42.150 --> 00:14:43.800
up and confuse people.

00:14:43.800 --> 00:14:45.620
[laughter] We didn't do that.

00:14:45.620 --> 00:14:49.280
ICESat-2 is a laser altimeter,
so it has a laser on board.

00:14:49.280 --> 00:14:52.930
And what it does is it sends out
a small pulse of laser light,

00:14:52.930 --> 00:14:56.020
and it times, super accurately,
how long it takes that light

00:14:56.020 --> 00:15:00.970
to go from the space craft
to the earth and back again.

00:15:00.970 --> 00:15:03.700
So that's essentially a range.

00:15:03.700 --> 00:15:06.960
And what it does with that
is we reconstruct elevation

00:15:06.960 --> 00:15:09.060
of the earth's surface.

00:15:09.060 --> 00:15:12.270
We do that by taking that time,
how long did it take to go

00:15:12.270 --> 00:15:15.730
from space craft to the
earth and back again,

00:15:15.730 --> 00:15:18.230
figuring out where we were
pointing or am I pointing

00:15:18.230 --> 00:15:19.530
at the wall over here?

00:15:19.530 --> 00:15:20.830
Am I pointing at
the wall over there?

00:15:20.830 --> 00:15:22.220
And where are we in the orbit?

00:15:22.220 --> 00:15:23.860
You put those three
pieces together

00:15:23.860 --> 00:15:26.120
and you can measure the height
of anything you fly over,

00:15:26.120 --> 00:15:28.780
just by bouncing
these laser beams off.

00:15:28.780 --> 00:15:31.360
The footprint size of the
laser beam on the ground is

00:15:31.360 --> 00:15:34.920
about 17 meters, so sort
of the size of this room.

00:15:34.920 --> 00:15:36.940
So we get really
detailed information.

00:15:36.940 --> 00:15:39.990
We can measure the height of
something about this size.

00:15:39.990 --> 00:15:43.000
Whereas GRACE was over
hundreds of square kilometers,

00:15:43.000 --> 00:15:46.800
we're measuring meter scale.

00:15:46.800 --> 00:15:49.580
However, we have fairly
low resolution temporally.

00:15:49.580 --> 00:15:51.580
We've got these little
spots on the ground,

00:15:51.580 --> 00:15:54.280
and our orbit repeats
about every 91 days.

00:15:54.280 --> 00:15:57.610
So we can see about times a
year how a particular place

00:15:57.610 --> 00:15:59.300
is changing.

00:15:59.300 --> 00:16:01.420
Together, these two
missions, GRACE-Follow-On

00:16:01.420 --> 00:16:03.590
and ICESat-2 are
really complimentary.

00:16:03.590 --> 00:16:05.330
One gives you great
time resolution,

00:16:05.330 --> 00:16:07.220
the other gives you
great spatial resolution.

00:16:07.220 --> 00:16:09.940
You put those two things
together, you we should be able

00:16:09.940 --> 00:16:12.400
to learn more about how ice
sheets and sea ice are changing

00:16:12.400 --> 00:16:14.770
than we've ever been
able to before.

00:16:16.310 --> 00:16:17.880
So I'm going to walk you
through a little bit more

00:16:17.880 --> 00:16:19.940
about how ICESat-2 works.

00:16:19.940 --> 00:16:22.200
The main instrument on
here is called the lidar.

00:16:22.200 --> 00:16:24.280
That's the thing that
generates the laser light.

00:16:24.280 --> 00:16:27.770
And the time it takes to go
from space craft to ground

00:16:27.770 --> 00:16:29.540
and back again, we call
a range measurement.

00:16:29.540 --> 00:16:31.740
It's essentially a distance.

00:16:31.740 --> 00:16:33.640
The other piece we need
is the pointing angle.

00:16:33.640 --> 00:16:35.020
Are we pointing straight down?

00:16:35.020 --> 00:16:36.320
Are we a little left?

00:16:36.320 --> 00:16:37.620
Are we a little right?

00:16:37.620 --> 00:16:39.840
And then the last piece is
where are we in the orbit?

00:16:39.840 --> 00:16:41.830
Are we over Maryland
or are we over Canada,

00:16:41.830 --> 00:16:43.170
or are we over Greenland?

00:16:43.170 --> 00:16:44.680
And we figure that out with GPS,

00:16:44.680 --> 00:16:46.220
just like you would
in your phone.

00:16:46.220 --> 00:16:48.380
Certainly, these are
much fancier GPSs

00:16:48.380 --> 00:16:50.690
and give us much
more accurate data

00:16:50.690 --> 00:16:52.020
than you would get from a phone.

00:16:52.020 --> 00:16:54.420
But basically, you take these
three pieces: pointing angle,

00:16:54.420 --> 00:16:56.820
range measurement, space
craft altitude, and you figure

00:16:56.820 --> 00:16:58.120
out the height of the earth.

00:16:58.120 --> 00:17:00.820
If you measure that height at
the same place through time,

00:17:00.820 --> 00:17:03.900
you can tell, is it getting
higher or is it getting lower?

00:17:03.900 --> 00:17:05.690
From the vantage point of space,

00:17:05.690 --> 00:17:07.500
you can see how ice
sheets are changing,

00:17:07.500 --> 00:17:12.420
how sea ice is changing, oceans,
deserts, forests, all of it,

00:17:12.420 --> 00:17:13.810
which is totally cool.

00:17:13.810 --> 00:17:19.160
A couple of slides
about technical details,

00:17:19.160 --> 00:17:20.930
in case anybody is interested.

00:17:20.930 --> 00:17:25.440
The laser on ICESat-2 fires
10,000 shots a second,

00:17:25.440 --> 00:17:28.530
which is an incredibly
fast repetition rate.

00:17:28.530 --> 00:17:33.060
And it sends out really small
pulses of light, so micropulses,

00:17:33.060 --> 00:17:37.010
we would call them, in each
of six beams simultaneously.

00:17:37.010 --> 00:17:40.230
That's the multibeam
part of it there.

00:17:40.230 --> 00:17:43.380
And the way it does its
detection and its measurement,

00:17:43.380 --> 00:17:45.970
it sends out these light pulses
of light 10,000 times a second,

00:17:45.970 --> 00:17:48.160
and it's actually
detecting individual photons

00:17:48.160 --> 00:17:49.460
as they come back.

00:17:49.460 --> 00:17:51.420
So we have super
sensitive detectors on board

00:17:51.420 --> 00:17:53.580
for each of those six spots.

00:17:53.580 --> 00:17:55.070
So people say, oh, you know,

00:17:55.070 --> 00:17:58.530
could I see the laser
light from the space craft?

00:17:58.530 --> 00:18:02.510
Probably not, because they're
so low energy and the number

00:18:02.510 --> 00:18:05.040
of photons that we're detecting
on the way back from each

00:18:05.040 --> 00:18:08.390
of these shots is
kind of 1, 2, 3, 4.

00:18:08.390 --> 00:18:11.100
It's really small number
of photons coming back in,

00:18:11.100 --> 00:18:13.970
but that's the basis
of our measurement.

00:18:13.970 --> 00:18:17.660
With this super fast firing
laser and our altitude,

00:18:17.660 --> 00:18:20.340
we get a footprint
that's about 17 meters

00:18:20.340 --> 00:18:25.790
in diameter every 70 centimeters
along each of those 6 beams.

00:18:25.790 --> 00:18:27.140
So the footprint from one shot

00:18:27.140 --> 00:18:31.380
to the next overlaps the
previous one by about 95%.

00:18:31.380 --> 00:18:33.360
So we end up with
continuous coverage

00:18:33.360 --> 00:18:35.090
in the along-track direction.

00:18:35.090 --> 00:18:36.600
It's a tremendous
amount of data.

00:18:36.600 --> 00:18:39.420
And it's a very NASA way of
measuring things, you know?

00:18:39.420 --> 00:18:42.190
It's a laser in space,
10,000 times a second,

00:18:42.190 --> 00:18:44.280
counting individual photons.

00:18:44.280 --> 00:18:45.890
It's kind of crazy.

00:18:45.890 --> 00:18:48.910
And the cool thing is, is that
later in the presentation,

00:18:48.910 --> 00:18:50.210
I'll be able to show
you what some

00:18:50.210 --> 00:18:51.520
of our early data looks like.

00:18:51.520 --> 00:18:53.940
We've been on orbit now
for about six weeks.

00:18:53.940 --> 00:18:55.720
We're still in calibration
phase,

00:18:55.720 --> 00:18:58.400
but it's astounding
what you can see

00:18:58.400 --> 00:19:01.260
with this kind of instrument.

00:19:01.260 --> 00:19:04.170
The last slide about
technical details is here.

00:19:04.170 --> 00:19:06.690
If you were able to see each of
these six spots on the ground,

00:19:06.690 --> 00:19:10.470
you'd see that we've arranged
them in a rectangular pattern,

00:19:10.470 --> 00:19:13.590
so that as the beams are
described on the surface

00:19:13.590 --> 00:19:15.850
of the earth, we have
these beam pairs.

00:19:15.850 --> 00:19:17.590
We have two beams right
next to each other,

00:19:17.590 --> 00:19:20.040
separated by about 90 meters.

00:19:20.040 --> 00:19:23.160
And what that does for us is it
lets us measure the elevation

00:19:23.160 --> 00:19:25.660
in the along-track
direction, sure.

00:19:25.660 --> 00:19:27.570
But it also lets us
measure the slope

00:19:27.570 --> 00:19:29.070
in the across-track direction.

00:19:29.070 --> 00:19:30.980
Is this one higher than
that one, or vice versa?

00:19:30.980 --> 00:19:33.370
And it turns out that's
a key piece in figuring

00:19:33.370 --> 00:19:36.480
out how ice sheet
elevations are changing.

00:19:36.480 --> 00:19:41.440
So we have six beams
arranged in three beam pairs.

00:19:41.440 --> 00:19:44.390
And if anybody's interested in
what wavelength we're using,

00:19:44.390 --> 00:19:47.850
it's a bright green
light, 532 nanometers.

00:19:47.850 --> 00:19:49.950
We split it into
six beams, and yeah,

00:19:49.950 --> 00:19:52.290
we're detecting individual
photons as they come in.

00:19:52.290 --> 00:19:54.640
I realize that for folks
who don't work on this kind

00:19:54.640 --> 00:19:56.420
of thing, it all sounds
a little bit esoteric.

00:19:56.420 --> 00:20:00.350
So we actually have a
little animation that --

00:20:00.350 --> 00:20:02.510
that really brings it home,
what this is all about.

00:20:02.510 --> 00:20:06.860
So let's see if I can
get this thing to play.

00:20:06.860 --> 00:20:08.160
Doo-doo-doo.

00:20:08.160 --> 00:20:12.010
[music] This is perfect
for management level.

00:20:12.010 --> 00:20:13.310
[murmuring animation sounds]

00:20:13.310 --> 00:20:14.610
&gt;&gt; No, no, no, no, no!

00:20:14.610 --> 00:20:18.120

There you go.

WEE! [shouts of excitement]

00:20:47.140 --> 00:20:48.440
&gt;&gt; Dr. Tom Neumann: Laser light
comes out, tons of photons,

00:20:48.440 --> 00:20:50.240
down towards the earth.

00:20:50.240 --> 00:20:59.010

Couple of them make it

00:21:01.610 --> 00:21:02.910
down to the earth's surface

00:21:02.910 --> 00:21:09.040
and bounce back towards
the space craft.

00:21:10.550 --> 00:21:12.350
&gt;&gt; [video] Weeeee!

&gt;&gt; Dr. Tom Neumann: Turns

00:21:22.950 --> 00:21:24.250
out photons get discouraged,
you know.

00:21:24.250 --> 00:21:26.050
[laughter] It's a long way.

00:21:26.050 --> 00:21:33.010

[ Triumphant Music ]

00:21:41.940 --> 00:21:48.360
[ Laughter ]

00:21:48.360 --> 00:21:50.660
&gt;&gt; Whoa! [laughter]

00:21:55.340 --> 00:21:57.680
[ Triumphant Music ]

00:21:57.680 --> 00:22:00.510
[ Laughter ]

00:22:00.510 --> 00:22:14.320
[ Music ]

00:22:14.320 --> 00:22:15.920
&gt;&gt; [video] Excellent job, pho.

00:22:15.920 --> 00:22:20.110
Your travel time
has been recorded.

00:22:20.110 --> 00:22:23.730
[music] Let's see the
data elevation dataset.

00:22:23.730 --> 00:22:25.820
Ready the next group!

00:22:25.820 --> 00:22:27.120
[music] [laughter]

00:22:27.120 --> 00:22:28.420
&gt;&gt; Dr. Tom Neumann: You know,
it's a little tongue-in-cheek,

00:22:28.420 --> 00:22:30.050
but it really is the
basis of how this works.

00:22:30.050 --> 00:22:31.700
We send out a whole
bunch of photons,

00:22:31.700 --> 00:22:34.050
we're detecting just one
or two on the way back

00:22:34.050 --> 00:22:35.850
and recording their travel time.

00:22:35.850 --> 00:22:37.600
And Adriana's here,
and she was the lead --

00:22:37.600 --> 00:22:40.690
one of the leads on
putting this one together,

00:22:40.690 --> 00:22:44.630
of coming up with a way to
explain how a laser altimeter

00:22:44.630 --> 00:22:46.180
in space lets you
measure height.

00:22:46.180 --> 00:22:48.670
That's actually how it happens.

00:22:48.670 --> 00:22:51.110
[music] Except photons
don't get discouraged.

00:22:51.110 --> 00:22:53.060
[laughter] They do
wear sunglasses though.

00:22:53.060 --> 00:22:54.360
I've seen them up close.

00:22:54.360 --> 00:22:56.080
[ Laughter ]

00:22:56.080 --> 00:22:58.010
So ICESat-2 is in orbit now.

00:22:58.010 --> 00:23:00.880
Our orbit takes us up to
88 degrees north and down

00:23:00.880 --> 00:23:03.570
to 88 degrees south,
and we do about 15 laps

00:23:03.570 --> 00:23:04.870
of the planet every day.

00:23:04.870 --> 00:23:06.260
Can you guys see this okay?

00:23:06.260 --> 00:23:08.030
From my perspective, it's
a little bit washed out,

00:23:08.030 --> 00:23:10.480
but you can see it cruising
around the planet there.

00:23:10.480 --> 00:23:13.320
You'll notice there's lots
of clouds on Earth, right?

00:23:13.320 --> 00:23:14.840
You go outside, maybe
it's a sunny day,

00:23:14.840 --> 00:23:16.280
maybe it's a cloudy day.

00:23:16.280 --> 00:23:21.490
We're using really low
energy visible green light.

00:23:21.490 --> 00:23:23.250
So on a cloudy day,
we're mostly going

00:23:23.250 --> 00:23:25.090
to measure the tops
of the clouds.

00:23:25.090 --> 00:23:26.390
The light will bounce
off the clouds.

00:23:26.390 --> 00:23:28.750
You might have seen
that in the last video,

00:23:28.750 --> 00:23:30.970
where some of the
photons got scattered

00:23:30.970 --> 00:23:32.610
by the clouds or bounced back.

00:23:32.610 --> 00:23:34.350
They didn't make it all
the way to the ground.

00:23:34.350 --> 00:23:37.120
But places where we
have a clear sky view,

00:23:37.120 --> 00:23:40.810
we'll detect photons coming back
from the surface of the earth.

00:23:40.810 --> 00:23:44.250
We're called ICESat-2 so the
instrument really is optimized

00:23:44.250 --> 00:23:49.570
to measure changes in sea ice
and in glaciers and ice sheets.

00:23:49.570 --> 00:23:51.620
But from space, as
I mentioned earlier,

00:23:51.620 --> 00:23:54.210
we really do get a
measurement of everything.

00:23:54.210 --> 00:23:56.460
We'll get lots of
data over the oceans.

00:23:56.460 --> 00:23:59.610
We'll get lots of data
over land, over cities.

00:23:59.610 --> 00:24:03.850
And we have data products that
cover each one of those things.

00:24:03.850 --> 00:24:08.180
The data product I work on,
the goal of that product is

00:24:08.180 --> 00:24:12.580
to generate unique latitude,
longitude, and elevation

00:24:12.580 --> 00:24:15.240
for each photon that we detect.

00:24:15.240 --> 00:24:19.070
So with a laser firing
10,000 times a second,

00:24:19.070 --> 00:24:22.140
six beams at the same time,

00:24:22.140 --> 00:24:24.870
order of about five
photons coming back,

00:24:24.870 --> 00:24:26.350
something like that.

00:24:26.350 --> 00:24:29.120
So one way to think about it
is that in the time it takes

00:24:29.120 --> 00:24:32.210
to blink about half a second,
ICESat-2 will do on the order

00:24:32.210 --> 00:24:35.910
of about 15 or 20,000 individual
measurements of photons.

00:24:35.910 --> 00:24:37.790
So it's a tremendous
amount of data.

00:24:37.790 --> 00:24:39.710
The laser is on 24/7.

00:24:39.710 --> 00:24:42.380
It's on all the time,
collecting data.

00:24:42.380 --> 00:24:44.820
So these data products are big.

00:24:44.820 --> 00:24:46.780
If you're interested
in ice sheet elevation

00:24:46.780 --> 00:24:48.080
and ice sheet elevation
exchange,

00:24:48.080 --> 00:24:50.180
you probably don't want
to deal with, you know,

00:24:50.180 --> 00:24:52.260
billions of individual photons.

00:24:52.260 --> 00:24:54.610
You're going to average
those together.

00:24:54.610 --> 00:24:57.480
Or similarly, if you're
interested in tree height,

00:24:57.480 --> 00:24:59.560
you don't want to deal with
things at the photon level.

00:24:59.560 --> 00:25:01.310
The data sets are
simply too big.

00:25:01.310 --> 00:25:04.070
So what the higher
level products do is

00:25:04.070 --> 00:25:05.920
to aggregate those
photons together.

00:25:05.920 --> 00:25:08.690
Maybe they'll take 40 meters
or so worth of photons

00:25:08.690 --> 00:25:12.210
or 100 meters worth of photons,
average those heights together

00:25:12.210 --> 00:25:13.970
to come up with one
elevation measurement

00:25:13.970 --> 00:25:17.640
that has much better
precision than a single photon.

00:25:17.640 --> 00:25:21.680
So I'm going to -- we
watched that one already.

00:25:21.680 --> 00:25:24.280
Oops. So what does the
data actually look like,

00:25:24.280 --> 00:25:26.070
if you're going to look at it?

00:25:26.070 --> 00:25:28.450
So we talked about how it's
detecting individual photons,

00:25:28.450 --> 00:25:29.750
right?

00:25:29.750 --> 00:25:31.050
And we're assigning an
individual latitude,

00:25:31.050 --> 00:25:32.350
longitude, and height.

00:25:32.350 --> 00:25:36.120
This turns out what you
would see if you plot it.

00:25:36.120 --> 00:25:39.570
We have elevation along the
y-axis, and all of these plots,

00:25:39.570 --> 00:25:44.150
and either time or
distance along the x-axis.

00:25:44.150 --> 00:25:46.700
And this is for data
for a single beam.

00:25:46.700 --> 00:25:48.450
You see each one of
these little blue dots?

00:25:48.450 --> 00:25:51.000
That's a photon that
ICESat-2 detected

00:25:51.000 --> 00:25:53.690
and sent the information back
to the earth, and we assign

00:25:53.690 --> 00:25:55.710
that latitude, longitude,
and height.

00:25:55.710 --> 00:25:58.960
Now you see there's a lot of
speckle in these random dots.

00:25:58.960 --> 00:26:02.590
We use green laser light, but
it turns out the sun also puts

00:26:02.590 --> 00:26:04.560
out light in the green
part of the spectrum.

00:26:04.560 --> 00:26:06.700
So that's background
light from the sun.

00:26:06.700 --> 00:26:09.540
At nighttime, you
don't see any of that.

00:26:09.540 --> 00:26:11.940
In the daytime, this
is about what you see.

00:26:11.940 --> 00:26:14.410
And the photons that are
reflected off the surface are

00:26:14.410 --> 00:26:17.020
this bright blue line
that jumps out at you.

00:26:17.020 --> 00:26:20.650
That line is actually
composed of millions of tiny --

00:26:20.650 --> 00:26:24.370
of individual photons that
we detected and located.

00:26:24.370 --> 00:26:26.790
So your problem then
becomes, if you're interested

00:26:26.790 --> 00:26:28.090
in the ice sheet's surface,

00:26:28.090 --> 00:26:32.510
is figuring out exactly what
the elevation of this line is.

00:26:32.510 --> 00:26:34.070
So that's why they're
doing averages

00:26:34.070 --> 00:26:36.330
and combining lots
of photon data.

00:26:36.330 --> 00:26:39.720
With just a single photon,
let's say this one, I can't tell

00:26:39.720 --> 00:26:42.520
if it's a background photon
or is it a signal photon

00:26:42.520 --> 00:26:45.080
that I'm interested
in off the surface?

00:26:45.080 --> 00:26:48.480
But your eye just naturally
aggregates photons together

00:26:48.480 --> 00:26:50.880
and it's just drawn to
this bright blue line.

00:26:50.880 --> 00:26:53.870
It turns out this is real
data from space collected

00:26:53.870 --> 00:26:56.250
about two weeks ago
over Antarctica.

00:26:56.250 --> 00:26:58.920
And the next couple slides
will show some of the data

00:26:58.920 --> 00:27:00.390
over different surface types

00:27:00.390 --> 00:27:02.610
to show you what
the data looks like.

00:27:02.610 --> 00:27:05.020
But each one of the slides
will be basically the same.

00:27:05.020 --> 00:27:07.910
Elevation along one
axis and time

00:27:07.910 --> 00:27:09.250
or distance along the other.

00:27:09.250 --> 00:27:13.090
You can think of it as, like,
a line across the stage here,

00:27:13.090 --> 00:27:15.390
and you're looking
at it in side view.

00:27:15.390 --> 00:27:18.040
So up above is higher elevation.

00:27:18.040 --> 00:27:20.300
This is the sky and the
space craft up here.

00:27:20.300 --> 00:27:23.410
Down below is the
center of the earth.

00:27:23.410 --> 00:27:26.300
Does that view make
sense to folks?

00:27:26.300 --> 00:27:27.600
Each of these dots?

00:27:27.600 --> 00:27:28.900
Yeah, okay.

00:27:28.900 --> 00:27:32.470
Cool. So we take data
over ocean, right?

00:27:32.470 --> 00:27:36.620
Here's a track that
went over the Atlantic,

00:27:36.620 --> 00:27:39.680
just off of the coast of
the U.S. You can see Maine

00:27:39.680 --> 00:27:41.550
over here, Canada over there.

00:27:41.550 --> 00:27:43.550
And we have elevation
along this axis.

00:27:43.550 --> 00:27:45.840
Here's about four and a half
kilometers on that axis.

00:27:45.840 --> 00:27:48.660
And it looks really kind
of lumpy through there.

00:27:48.660 --> 00:27:50.180
But it turns out if you
zoom in a little bit,

00:27:50.180 --> 00:27:52.010
what we're doing is we're
detecting individual

00:27:52.010 --> 00:27:53.790
ocean swells.

00:27:53.790 --> 00:27:56.080
[audience murmurs] The
height of this is --

00:27:56.080 --> 00:27:57.820
these ticks are two
meters apart.

00:27:57.820 --> 00:28:00.880
So these things are kind
of four meters high are so,

00:28:00.880 --> 00:28:03.060
about 700 meters along-track.

00:28:03.060 --> 00:28:06.190
So that's four meters of relief
in each one of these waves

00:28:06.190 --> 00:28:11.800
or swells that are tens or
hundreds of meters long.

00:28:11.800 --> 00:28:13.100
So wavelengths in
this picture are

00:28:13.100 --> 00:28:15.240
about on the order
of 140 meters.

00:28:15.240 --> 00:28:17.290
You see there's relatively
little background light,

00:28:17.290 --> 00:28:20.800
so the sun was pretty low in
the sky when we took this pass.

00:28:20.800 --> 00:28:22.160
But that's pretty cool.

00:28:22.160 --> 00:28:24.900
But yeah. This is
all data from space.

00:28:24.900 --> 00:28:26.990
We had simulated data
ahead of time to work

00:28:26.990 --> 00:28:28.750
on this, that, or the other.

00:28:28.750 --> 00:28:30.170
This is real data.

00:28:30.170 --> 00:28:34.570
It's mind boggling to me in
some ways how well it's working

00:28:34.570 --> 00:28:36.590
and the cool things you can see.

00:28:36.590 --> 00:28:41.510
Here's some data over
Russia, a forest in Siberia.

00:28:41.510 --> 00:28:43.310
You see all this
background light.

00:28:43.310 --> 00:28:44.610
This is daytime data.

00:28:44.610 --> 00:28:47.770
Certainly, you can see
these blurry things here

00:28:47.770 --> 00:28:49.070
at the surface.

00:28:49.070 --> 00:28:50.380
Those are returns off of trees.

00:28:50.380 --> 00:28:52.880
What you see is this
bright line underneath,

00:28:52.880 --> 00:28:55.040
that's the ground
beneath the trees.

00:28:55.040 --> 00:28:57.170
And some photons are being
reflected off the top

00:28:57.170 --> 00:28:59.830
of the canopy, some off
the middle of the canopy.

00:28:59.830 --> 00:29:01.910
So we can use ICESat-2
data to figure

00:29:01.910 --> 00:29:04.550
out tree heights
around the world.

00:29:04.550 --> 00:29:07.660
We take this height, compare it
with the height of the earth,

00:29:07.660 --> 00:29:08.960
and there's your tree height.

00:29:08.960 --> 00:29:11.090
Here's a little blow up
of that scene right there,

00:29:11.090 --> 00:29:13.310
and you can see these trees
are kind of on the order of,

00:29:13.310 --> 00:29:14.740
oh, 15, 20 meters high.

00:29:14.740 --> 00:29:16.040
So they're pretty big trees.

00:29:16.040 --> 00:29:17.640
They're kind of 60
foot tall trees.

00:29:17.640 --> 00:29:20.820
You can also see a break
in the canopy right here,

00:29:20.820 --> 00:29:23.850
either a road cut or a
stream or that sort of thing.

00:29:23.850 --> 00:29:26.590
Here's an image from Google
Earth with our tracks on here.

00:29:26.590 --> 00:29:29.740
And then here's the little
road we're crossing right

00:29:29.740 --> 00:29:31.040
down there at the bottom.

00:29:31.040 --> 00:29:33.530
So that's pretty astounding.

00:29:33.530 --> 00:29:35.640
And we haven't even got
to the good stuff yet.

00:29:35.640 --> 00:29:37.040
[laughter]

00:29:37.040 --> 00:29:39.460
Here's a track coming
off of Mexico

00:29:39.460 --> 00:29:42.850
into the Pacific Ocean
from left to right.

00:29:42.850 --> 00:29:45.790
Again, elevation on this
axis, distance on that axis.

00:29:45.790 --> 00:29:47.870
We're coming down the
forested hillside.

00:29:47.870 --> 00:29:50.170
You can see the trees, just
like we saw in the last picture.

00:29:50.170 --> 00:29:52.920
And then we cross
over into this lagoon.

00:29:52.920 --> 00:29:55.710
You get a bright
return off the surface,

00:29:55.710 --> 00:29:57.380
but some of that green
light is actually getting

00:29:57.380 --> 00:29:59.680
down into the water, and
we're picking up the bottom

00:29:59.680 --> 00:30:00.980
of the lagoon, as well.

00:30:00.980 --> 00:30:03.390
You can measure depth of water

00:30:03.390 --> 00:30:05.680
up to some distance
with this data.

00:30:05.680 --> 00:30:08.050
Compare the surface with
the bottom and you can say,

00:30:08.050 --> 00:30:10.360
all right, well that's
about four meters deep,

00:30:10.360 --> 00:30:11.900
which is totally cool.

00:30:11.900 --> 00:30:14.400
You go across a little
shawl right here

00:30:14.400 --> 00:30:17.020
and you can see these
individual waves in the ocean.

00:30:17.020 --> 00:30:19.280
The water in the lagoon is nice
and still, as you'd expect.

00:30:19.280 --> 00:30:22.710
And you get ocean
waves, as we saw earlier.

00:30:22.710 --> 00:30:24.110
Here's another scene
from Mexico.

00:30:24.110 --> 00:30:26.630
We have the Gulf of
Mexico over here.

00:30:26.630 --> 00:30:28.700
We're getting a lot
more reflections

00:30:28.700 --> 00:30:30.000
in the water column here.

00:30:30.000 --> 00:30:31.300
It's because the
water is turbid.

00:30:31.300 --> 00:30:34.240
There's lots of stuff in the
water reflecting laser light.

00:30:34.240 --> 00:30:38.000
A stand of mangrove forests,
and they're interpreting this

00:30:38.000 --> 00:30:41.050
as mangroves because you're
getting a really bright return

00:30:41.050 --> 00:30:44.310
beneath them, and it's very
flat, which is what you'd expect

00:30:44.310 --> 00:30:47.340
from still water under
these kind of trees.

00:30:47.340 --> 00:30:49.150
As you move farther
to the right,

00:30:49.150 --> 00:30:51.480
you see the ground
elevation starts to vary.

00:30:51.480 --> 00:30:53.090
You get hills, you
get little ridges.

00:30:53.090 --> 00:30:57.330
So that's more of a
non-flooded forest.

00:30:57.330 --> 00:30:59.630
But that's totally cool.

00:31:01.310 --> 00:31:02.610
Here's another scene.

00:31:02.610 --> 00:31:05.120
This one is off the
coast of Australia.

00:31:05.120 --> 00:31:07.230
You see the land, there's
some trees at the coast.

00:31:07.230 --> 00:31:09.610
And then the coastline's
right here.

00:31:09.610 --> 00:31:13.050
We have the surface of the
water, some ocean waves.

00:31:13.050 --> 00:31:14.460
But you look faintly,
you might be able

00:31:14.460 --> 00:31:17.150
to see the bathymetry
through here.

00:31:17.150 --> 00:31:18.860
So you can tell how
deep the water is.

00:31:18.860 --> 00:31:20.980
You can see that there's
a mount right here.

00:31:20.980 --> 00:31:22.900
There's another ridge over here.

00:31:22.900 --> 00:31:26.830
And that's nine meters worth of
water that we're seeing through.

00:31:26.830 --> 00:31:28.960
Further off to the right,
you kind of get some hints

00:31:28.960 --> 00:31:31.250
of some other structure
down here,

00:31:31.250 --> 00:31:33.170
which is a good 25
meters of water.

00:31:33.170 --> 00:31:35.820
That's 75 feet of water.

00:31:35.820 --> 00:31:39.390
That's a lot of water
that we're seeing through.

00:31:39.390 --> 00:31:40.690
Super excited about it.

00:31:40.690 --> 00:31:42.510
So here's one more.

00:31:42.510 --> 00:31:45.780
This is the Bikini Atoll, some
really clear Pacific water.

00:31:45.780 --> 00:31:47.460
Similar to picture to
what we've seen before.

00:31:47.460 --> 00:31:49.050
You've got some ocean waves.

00:31:49.050 --> 00:31:52.610
You've got the land right here.

00:31:52.610 --> 00:31:54.690
So that's this peak showing up.

00:31:54.690 --> 00:31:58.150
And you can see the
edge of the lagoon reef.

00:31:58.150 --> 00:31:59.910
This is 30 meters of water.

00:31:59.910 --> 00:32:02.370
That's almost 100 feet of
water we're ranging through,

00:32:02.370 --> 00:32:05.880
from space, using
individual photons.

00:32:05.880 --> 00:32:07.180
That's insane!

00:32:07.180 --> 00:32:08.720
It's just crazy.

00:32:08.720 --> 00:32:11.070
So when we started
showing this data to some

00:32:11.070 --> 00:32:14.210
of the oceanography community,
and they're super excited.

00:32:14.210 --> 00:32:15.680
Because measuring
bathymetry close

00:32:15.680 --> 00:32:17.820
to coast is a pretty
hard thing to do.

00:32:17.820 --> 00:32:21.460
You can't bring ships into
each of these little lagoons

00:32:21.460 --> 00:32:23.620
and you can't bring
them close to the coast

00:32:23.620 --> 00:32:26.400
so they can map deeper
water more easily

00:32:26.400 --> 00:32:28.940
than they can map
shallow water bathymetry.

00:32:28.940 --> 00:32:31.650
This is going to be an
awesome tool for them.

00:32:34.040 --> 00:32:37.210
So for the cryosphere, we're
designed to do cryosphere.

00:32:37.210 --> 00:32:38.870
So all of this is like gravy.

00:32:38.870 --> 00:32:40.170
This is all bonus.

00:32:40.170 --> 00:32:41.470
We're going to do cool
things for forests,

00:32:41.470 --> 00:32:44.000
we're going to do cool
things for oceans.

00:32:44.000 --> 00:32:49.390
What we're really interested
in is sea ice and glaciers;

00:32:49.390 --> 00:32:50.930
glaciers and ice sheets.

00:32:50.930 --> 00:32:54.690
So here's a graphic of how
this works for sea ice.

00:32:54.690 --> 00:32:57.240
So we talked about how we can
measure sea ice extent pretty

00:32:57.240 --> 00:33:00.640
readily, but we can't measure
the thickness very well.

00:33:00.640 --> 00:33:02.390
And this graphic
didn't want to play.

00:33:02.390 --> 00:33:05.410
I'm going to try
backing it up again.

00:33:05.410 --> 00:33:08.320
Boop! Let's see if
it goes this time.

00:33:08.320 --> 00:33:11.520
But yeah, you can measure
the extent with a camera,

00:33:11.520 --> 00:33:13.820
but measuring the
thickness is harder.

00:33:13.820 --> 00:33:16.570
Getting this graphic
to play is harder yet.

00:33:16.570 --> 00:33:17.870
[laughter] Hmm.

00:33:17.870 --> 00:33:21.330
I don't know why that
doesn't want to go.

00:33:21.330 --> 00:33:22.630
That's goofy.

00:33:22.630 --> 00:33:23.930
But actually, we can
just pause it right there

00:33:23.930 --> 00:33:25.230
and I can explain it from here.

00:33:25.230 --> 00:33:26.530
So we're going along
with our six beams,

00:33:26.530 --> 00:33:28.150
we're measuring the height
of everything, right?

00:33:28.150 --> 00:33:30.260
So here, you see
some open water.

00:33:30.260 --> 00:33:33.860
And here's some sea ice
that's sitting in that water.

00:33:33.860 --> 00:33:35.160
Ooh, here you go.

00:33:35.160 --> 00:33:36.460
I wonder if I can
pause it right there.

00:33:36.460 --> 00:33:38.580
Ooh. Rats.

00:33:38.580 --> 00:33:40.080
[laughter] I'm going
to get it yet.

00:33:40.080 --> 00:33:44.670
If this is my biggest problem
today, I'm doing pretty well.

00:33:44.670 --> 00:33:46.150
So we'll take those
two measurements.

00:33:46.150 --> 00:33:49.480
We have the height of the
sea ice and the height

00:33:49.480 --> 00:33:50.780
of the water that
it's sitting in.

00:33:50.780 --> 00:33:54.930
And somehow it got to
a really good shot.

00:33:54.930 --> 00:33:57.950
I'm going to be patient.

00:33:59.170 --> 00:34:00.960
Okay, I'm not that patient.

00:34:00.960 --> 00:34:02.260
[laughter] But what we do

00:34:02.260 --> 00:34:04.260
to measure the sea ice
thickness is just compare those

00:34:04.260 --> 00:34:06.560
two heights.

00:34:10.260 --> 00:34:15.600
Trying to get a stable picture
that I can actually talk to.

00:34:15.600 --> 00:34:16.900
There we go.

00:34:16.900 --> 00:34:18.200
Cool. That's perfect.

00:34:18.200 --> 00:34:19.500
All right.

00:34:19.500 --> 00:34:20.800
So here's a crack
in the sea ice,

00:34:20.800 --> 00:34:22.100
where you can see the ocean
water sticking through.

00:34:22.100 --> 00:34:24.170
We're getting heights and
elevations of the sea ice

00:34:24.170 --> 00:34:27.320
on either side of it, and you
have the ocean water in between.

00:34:27.320 --> 00:34:28.780
So for sea ice science,
what we want

00:34:28.780 --> 00:34:30.780
to do is compare
those two heights.

00:34:30.780 --> 00:34:33.850
That tells us how high
the sea ice is sticking

00:34:33.850 --> 00:34:35.150
up out of the water.

00:34:35.150 --> 00:34:38.200
The term for that is "free
board," same as a free board

00:34:38.200 --> 00:34:40.580
on a boat, if you guys
are sailors at all.

00:34:40.580 --> 00:34:43.250
But what it does for sea ice
is since we know it's ice,

00:34:43.250 --> 00:34:46.030
we know the density of it, we
know the density of the water,

00:34:46.030 --> 00:34:48.610
it lets us estimate the
thickness of that sea ice.

00:34:48.610 --> 00:34:51.680
About 10% of sea ice sticks
up out of the ocean water.

00:34:51.680 --> 00:34:54.750
So in this case, let's
say the free board

00:34:54.750 --> 00:34:57.100
of the sea ice was
about 30 centimeters.

00:34:57.100 --> 00:34:58.400
That means the total thickness

00:34:58.400 --> 00:35:01.510
of that sea ice is
about 10 times that.

00:35:01.510 --> 00:35:03.480
It's about 3 meters.

00:35:03.480 --> 00:35:05.890
That lets us get at the
third dimension of sea ice.

00:35:05.890 --> 00:35:08.800
We can measure the extent
really readily from cameras,

00:35:08.800 --> 00:35:11.550
but getting the thickness has
been a long-standing challenge

00:35:11.550 --> 00:35:13.530
for sea ice science.

00:35:13.530 --> 00:35:16.420
So with ICESat-2 data
combined with those images,

00:35:16.420 --> 00:35:19.520
we really can put together
a three-dimensional picture

00:35:19.520 --> 00:35:21.590
of the sea ice in the
Arctic, in the Antarctic,

00:35:21.590 --> 00:35:24.040
and how it's changing
through time.

00:35:24.040 --> 00:35:27.130
So here's an example of what
data over sea ice look like.

00:35:27.130 --> 00:35:30.070
It's a little messier, but
what you end up seeing are all

00:35:30.070 --> 00:35:31.930
of these ridges on sea ice.

00:35:31.930 --> 00:35:33.230
That's the sea ice elevation.

00:35:33.230 --> 00:35:36.480
But can you see these little
flat spots through here?

00:35:36.480 --> 00:35:37.880
Those are cracks in the sea ice.

00:35:37.880 --> 00:35:40.690
That's where we're ranging down
to the ocean in between them.

00:35:40.690 --> 00:35:43.020
So these are really small leads.

00:35:43.020 --> 00:35:44.940
Here's a scale bar
for reference.

00:35:44.940 --> 00:35:47.960
It's about 70 kilometers, so
this is a long stretch of data

00:35:47.960 --> 00:35:49.740
through the Arctic Ocean.

00:35:49.740 --> 00:35:51.650
But there's some
larger leads over here

00:35:51.650 --> 00:35:53.400
and another big one over there.

00:35:53.400 --> 00:35:55.740
So in this case, we have
the ocean water here,

00:35:55.740 --> 00:35:57.480
right about zero meters.

00:35:57.480 --> 00:36:01.330
And the sea ice here is about --
sticking up by about one meters.

00:36:01.330 --> 00:36:03.880
So that's actually really
thick, probably old sea ice.

00:36:03.880 --> 00:36:05.550
It's on the order
of ten meters thick,

00:36:05.550 --> 00:36:09.250
about ten times what you're
measuring for the free board.

00:36:09.250 --> 00:36:11.600
So from a data processing
standpoint, the challenge

00:36:11.600 --> 00:36:15.540
of sea ice data is to
separate ocean elevation

00:36:15.540 --> 00:36:18.940
from sea ice elevation so
you can do that difference.

00:36:22.040 --> 00:36:24.530
Over ice sheets, here's a
stretch from Antarctica.

00:36:24.530 --> 00:36:25.930
Here's the Ross Sea down here,

00:36:25.930 --> 00:36:28.930
Ross Ice Shelf going
up onto the plateau.

00:36:28.930 --> 00:36:30.260
Actually, this one's
going the other way.

00:36:30.260 --> 00:36:33.700
It's going from the plateau
down onto the ice sheet.

00:36:33.700 --> 00:36:36.200
Elevation-wise, ice
sheets are kind of boring.

00:36:36.200 --> 00:36:37.870
They're pretty flat.

00:36:37.870 --> 00:36:41.430
They do have some typography
to them, but not like the coast

00:36:41.430 --> 00:36:44.470
of Mexico and not like
Australia, and not like sea ice.

00:36:44.470 --> 00:36:48.160
So this data often looks
pretty flat at a short scale,

00:36:48.160 --> 00:36:50.680
but at a larger scale, you start
to see mountains through there

00:36:50.680 --> 00:36:52.040
that we're ranging to.

00:36:52.040 --> 00:36:54.340
The blue line is ICESat-2 data.

00:36:54.340 --> 00:36:57.800
And this black line
that's on top of it is data

00:36:57.800 --> 00:37:01.210
from another lesser satellite
that we won't talk about.

00:37:01.210 --> 00:37:04.730
And you can see how this
black line is far inferior

00:37:04.730 --> 00:37:08.180
to the super detail we're
getting from ICESat-2.

00:37:08.180 --> 00:37:10.740
The data from along the black
curve are totally missing this

00:37:10.740 --> 00:37:13.080
value right here, while
we're picking up the bottom

00:37:13.080 --> 00:37:16.630
of the valley and the little
peaks in the valley, as well.

00:37:16.630 --> 00:37:18.530
So that's totally cool.

00:37:18.530 --> 00:37:20.790
Here's another stretch
where there's some crevasses

00:37:20.790 --> 00:37:22.430
or cracks in the ice sheet.

00:37:22.430 --> 00:37:27.500
These are pretty steep sides on
these things, and we're picking

00:37:27.500 --> 00:37:30.340
up the slopes from the top all
the way down to the bottom,

00:37:30.340 --> 00:37:31.850
some data off the
bottom and back again.

00:37:31.850 --> 00:37:33.510
So we can actually
measure crevasse depth,

00:37:33.510 --> 00:37:35.050
as well, which is cool.

00:37:35.050 --> 00:37:39.190
What we really want to do though
is take data from ice sheets

00:37:39.190 --> 00:37:42.180
from the same place and
compare it through time

00:37:42.180 --> 00:37:44.890
to see how it's getting bigger
and how it's getting smaller.

00:37:44.890 --> 00:37:47.530
We think with the data
quality we're seeing so far,

00:37:47.530 --> 00:37:49.500
we should be able to
resolve elevation changes

00:37:49.500 --> 00:37:54.670
of about a centimeter,
from space, using photons.

00:37:54.670 --> 00:37:57.630
It's -- I've worked on the
project for about ten years,

00:37:57.630 --> 00:38:01.560
and you go through lots of hoops
and reviews and things go well

00:38:01.560 --> 00:38:02.860
and things don't go well.

00:38:02.860 --> 00:38:05.100
But it's so gratifying to
actually see it on orbit

00:38:05.100 --> 00:38:07.340
and collecting data like that.

00:38:07.340 --> 00:38:08.860
It's really amazing.

00:38:08.860 --> 00:38:13.590
And the data quality has
been just outstanding.

00:38:13.590 --> 00:38:17.340
Knock on wood [knocking]
[laughter] Cool.

00:38:17.340 --> 00:38:19.420
So ICESat-2 is in orbit now.

00:38:19.420 --> 00:38:21.420
Here's the first known
sighting of ICESat-2.

00:38:21.420 --> 00:38:23.130
It might be a little
bit hard to see.

00:38:23.130 --> 00:38:27.590
One of our colleagues in the
lab, Jeremy, was down in Chile.

00:38:27.590 --> 00:38:30.880
He took a look at where we were
supposed to be through time

00:38:30.880 --> 00:38:33.200
and he noticed that on
October 25th at about 3:00

00:38:33.200 --> 00:38:34.570
in the morning, we were
going to be very close

00:38:34.570 --> 00:38:36.160
to where he was in Chile.

00:38:36.160 --> 00:38:37.910
And so he set up his
camera on a tripod

00:38:37.910 --> 00:38:39.800
on about a 20 second exposure.

00:38:39.800 --> 00:38:41.440
And I can't even see
it from my angle,

00:38:41.440 --> 00:38:43.330
but there should be a line right

00:38:43.330 --> 00:38:46.140
through here and
that's ICESat-2.

00:38:46.140 --> 00:38:48.510
That's how you know
it's not fake.

00:38:48.510 --> 00:38:51.260
[ Laughter ]

00:38:51.260 --> 00:38:52.720
You can go outside and
see it go past, right?

00:38:52.720 --> 00:38:54.030
&gt;&gt; Somebody could
draw a line of it.

00:38:54.030 --> 00:38:56.040
[ Laughter ]

00:38:56.040 --> 00:38:57.340
&gt;&gt; Dr. Tom Neumann:
I encourage you

00:38:57.340 --> 00:38:58.640
to take a look at our website.

00:38:58.640 --> 00:39:00.520
You can see when we're going
to be in your neighborhood,

00:39:00.520 --> 00:39:03.070
and you can look up
at the right time.

00:39:03.070 --> 00:39:05.090
And if the sun catches
the solar array,

00:39:05.090 --> 00:39:06.400
this is exactly what you'd see.

00:39:06.400 --> 00:39:08.890
&gt;&gt; The website is
the heavens-above,

00:39:08.890 --> 00:39:10.510
you can see any satellite
going over.

00:39:10.510 --> 00:39:11.810
&gt;&gt; Dr. Tom Neumann:
That's right.

00:39:11.810 --> 00:39:13.110
And you can just type in
ICESat-2 and it'll tell you

00:39:13.110 --> 00:39:15.090
when your next pass is.

00:39:15.090 --> 00:39:17.500
Absolutely.

00:39:17.500 --> 00:39:20.790
Cool. So the last section I'm
going to talk about is, okay,

00:39:20.790 --> 00:39:22.980
great, we're measuring all
these elevations from space.

00:39:22.980 --> 00:39:24.280
It's outstanding.

00:39:24.280 --> 00:39:25.580
Yada, yada, yada.

00:39:25.580 --> 00:39:27.470
How do you know they're right?

00:39:27.470 --> 00:39:29.610
How do we compare with
something else to say

00:39:29.610 --> 00:39:31.450
that we're getting
the right answer?

00:39:31.450 --> 00:39:35.480
So you might have noticed in
the animation of the orbits

00:39:35.480 --> 00:39:37.530
that we go up to 88
north and 88 south.

00:39:37.530 --> 00:39:42.290
And all of our tracks converge
right at 88 north and 88 south.

00:39:42.290 --> 00:39:44.290
It turns out that 88 north,
of course, is in the middle

00:39:44.290 --> 00:39:46.940
of the Arctic Ocean, kind
of a tough place to get to.

00:39:46.940 --> 00:39:50.250
88 south, ironically enough,
is much easier to get to.

00:39:50.250 --> 00:39:51.610
It's pretty close
to the South Pole.

00:39:51.610 --> 00:39:55.530
It's about 220 kilometers away.

00:39:55.530 --> 00:39:57.750
And you can fly down
to the South Pole.

00:39:57.750 --> 00:39:59.970
The U.S. has a research station
right at the center there,

00:39:59.970 --> 00:40:02.480
which is what I did
last year in December

00:40:02.480 --> 00:40:03.780
with three other colleagues.

00:40:03.780 --> 00:40:08.460
And we went out to this area
to measure the elevation

00:40:08.460 --> 00:40:11.840
of the ice sheet with GPS.

00:40:11.840 --> 00:40:15.000
We flew into South Pole Station,
we took two tract vehicles

00:40:15.000 --> 00:40:18.320
and drove out to this 88
south line of latitude

00:40:18.320 --> 00:40:22.700
and surveyed the elevation along
this part of the arc right here.

00:40:22.700 --> 00:40:26.510
We had two high precision
GPS instruments with us

00:40:26.510 --> 00:40:29.590
to create a reference
dataset for ICESat-2.

00:40:29.590 --> 00:40:32.690
So when we're getting data
from space, we can compare it

00:40:32.690 --> 00:40:36.420
with our GPS data to say,
well, how are we doing?

00:40:36.420 --> 00:40:39.340
And having that independent
dataset is a great check

00:40:39.340 --> 00:40:40.640
on the data.

00:40:40.640 --> 00:40:42.370
All of our tracks converge
around this circle,

00:40:42.370 --> 00:40:46.990
so as it turns out, ICESat-2
will survey this little section

00:40:46.990 --> 00:40:48.290
at least once a day

00:40:48.290 --> 00:40:50.580
and sometimes twice a
day, depending on the day.

00:40:50.580 --> 00:40:54.250
The whole circle was too
far around for us to go.

00:40:54.250 --> 00:40:56.400
We were cold and
wanted to go home.

00:40:56.400 --> 00:40:58.840
[laughter] So we only did
this 300 kilometer stretch.

00:40:58.840 --> 00:41:00.880
Actually, that's not true.

00:41:00.880 --> 00:41:02.590
It was all part of the plan.

00:41:02.590 --> 00:41:03.890
But still.

00:41:03.890 --> 00:41:06.920
[laughter] We'll intersect 277
of the tracts, it's about 20%

00:41:06.920 --> 00:41:09.050
of the ICESat-2 tracks.

00:41:09.050 --> 00:41:12.470
And yeah, we're getting
about one centimeter accuracy

00:41:12.470 --> 00:41:15.190
with our GPS survey, so
it's a really solid dataset

00:41:15.190 --> 00:41:17.470
to compare with.

00:41:17.470 --> 00:41:19.540
There's a campaign,
an airborne campaign,

00:41:19.540 --> 00:41:22.860
called Oppression IceBridge
that flies a laser altimeter

00:41:22.860 --> 00:41:25.430
from an aircraft, and they've
actually flown this circle

00:41:25.430 --> 00:41:26.730
several times.

00:41:26.730 --> 00:41:29.550
So we're able to take our
ground data from the pink line,

00:41:29.550 --> 00:41:32.320
especially around this 88
south arc, and compare it

00:41:32.320 --> 00:41:34.190
with their data from
an airplane,

00:41:34.190 --> 00:41:37.320
and then compare the airplane
data to the data from space.

00:41:37.320 --> 00:41:39.970
So it's sort of a nested
calibration approach.

00:41:39.970 --> 00:41:42.510
We just surveyed this
little 300 kilometers,

00:41:42.510 --> 00:41:46.340
but if we use our 300 kilometers
to prove out the aircraft data,

00:41:46.340 --> 00:41:48.650
then we can use that
aircraft data to look

00:41:48.650 --> 00:41:54.040
at an even larger scale,
all to assess ICESat-2.

00:41:54.040 --> 00:41:55.710
So here's what it looks
like when you're cruising

00:41:55.710 --> 00:41:58.440
around at 88 south with 3
of your closest friends.

00:41:58.440 --> 00:41:59.740
We had tract vehicle here.

00:41:59.740 --> 00:42:01.460
We had a big long sled behind us

00:42:01.460 --> 00:42:03.150
that had pretty much
everything we needed

00:42:03.150 --> 00:42:05.660
for the next couple
weeks we were out there.

00:42:05.660 --> 00:42:07.050
We had two of these vehicles.

00:42:07.050 --> 00:42:10.270
You guys might be able to see
these yellow blobs on here.

00:42:10.270 --> 00:42:11.570
Those are our tents.

00:42:11.570 --> 00:42:14.220
We just left them set
up right on the surface.

00:42:14.220 --> 00:42:17.280
And this is pretty typical of
what it looks like down there.

00:42:17.280 --> 00:42:19.820
It's pretty flat, right?

00:42:19.820 --> 00:42:22.330
You see some little
bumps, little ridges here.

00:42:22.330 --> 00:42:25.010
These are little
snowdrifts called sastrugi.

00:42:25.010 --> 00:42:27.970
But big picture,
it's pretty flat.

00:42:27.970 --> 00:42:30.140
If you take a look
at what the --

00:42:30.140 --> 00:42:32.990
I think I got to
go forward two --

00:42:32.990 --> 00:42:36.200
what the data actually look
like, here's a similar plot

00:42:36.200 --> 00:42:37.500
to what we saw before.

00:42:37.500 --> 00:42:40.150
Here's elevation on this
axis, distance on that one.

00:42:40.150 --> 00:42:41.950
We went over this giant hill.

00:42:41.950 --> 00:42:44.370
It was like 300 feet high.

00:42:44.370 --> 00:42:46.370
But it was like 100 miles long.

00:42:46.370 --> 00:42:48.170
I mean, you would have no idea
that there's a hill there.

00:42:48.170 --> 00:42:49.720
It's so subtle.

00:42:49.720 --> 00:42:51.830
[laughter] But when you
look at the whole arc,

00:42:51.830 --> 00:42:54.410
all the way around 300
kilometers, this is the kind

00:42:54.410 --> 00:42:55.710
of typography you see.

00:42:55.710 --> 00:42:59.070
It's one of the flattest places
on the ice sheet down there.

00:42:59.070 --> 00:43:04.440
The other experiment we left out
there are called corner cubes.

00:43:04.440 --> 00:43:09.270
So comparing against our
reference GPS data gives you a

00:43:09.270 --> 00:43:11.540
sense of elevation,
how good are we doing

00:43:11.540 --> 00:43:13.450
in our elevation measurement.

00:43:13.450 --> 00:43:16.880
What these do is let us test
out how we're doing in terms

00:43:16.880 --> 00:43:19.180
of assigning a latitude
and a longitude.

00:43:19.180 --> 00:43:21.970
There's a little plastic
cap we bought at Home Depot,

00:43:21.970 --> 00:43:23.270
drilled a hole in it,

00:43:23.270 --> 00:43:25.630
and there's a little
piece of glass in there.

00:43:25.630 --> 00:43:28.340
Now, the facets and
the edges on that piece

00:43:28.340 --> 00:43:29.700
of glass are optimized

00:43:29.700 --> 00:43:34.140
to reflect green light
back to the space craft.

00:43:34.140 --> 00:43:37.070
When we put these poles in,
we surveyed the location

00:43:37.070 --> 00:43:39.870
of these poles super accurately
with our GPS to be good

00:43:39.870 --> 00:43:41.540
to about a centimeter.

00:43:41.540 --> 00:43:43.680
And these little
pieces of glass in here,

00:43:43.680 --> 00:43:46.790
corner cube retro reflectors,
bounces that light back

00:43:46.790 --> 00:43:48.230
to the space craft,
and we should be able

00:43:48.230 --> 00:43:50.600
to pick these up in our data.

00:43:50.600 --> 00:43:54.670
So we should be able to uniquely
say, oh, this is pole 209,

00:43:54.670 --> 00:43:58.020
and our data processing
assigns it a latitude,

00:43:58.020 --> 00:43:59.530
a longitude, and an elevation.

00:43:59.530 --> 00:44:02.510
But we have an individual
check, an independent check,

00:44:02.510 --> 00:44:07.260
on the latitude, the longitude,
and the elevation of about 40

00:44:07.260 --> 00:44:08.560
of these little poles
that we left

00:44:08.560 --> 00:44:11.090
out in the middle
of the ice sheet.

00:44:11.090 --> 00:44:14.700
So the GPS data by itself
lets you check elevation,

00:44:14.700 --> 00:44:17.970
but surveying specific known
targets lets you check the

00:44:17.970 --> 00:44:20.110
latitude and the
longitude, as well.

00:44:20.110 --> 00:44:23.720
Another way you might think
of doing it is hunting

00:44:23.720 --> 00:44:25.400
through our data
until you find data

00:44:25.400 --> 00:44:27.070
that passes over this building.

00:44:27.070 --> 00:44:29.330
We know exactly where
this building is.

00:44:29.330 --> 00:44:31.130
We know exactly how high it is.

00:44:31.130 --> 00:44:32.890
You can go into the
ICESat-2 data and say, well,

00:44:32.890 --> 00:44:35.360
what did ICESat-2 think about
the height of this building

00:44:35.360 --> 00:44:38.010
and the location of the
edges of the building.

00:44:38.010 --> 00:44:40.400
This is a finer measurement
than using a building,

00:44:40.400 --> 00:44:41.860
because this corner
cube is about the size

00:44:41.860 --> 00:44:44.580
of your fingernail and
we know its position

00:44:44.580 --> 00:44:46.530
to better than a centimeter.

00:44:46.530 --> 00:44:47.940
I'm not sure if you
could get positions

00:44:47.940 --> 00:44:50.150
of GSA buildings
to a centimeter.

00:44:50.150 --> 00:44:52.310
If they have it, they
probably don't give it

00:44:52.310 --> 00:44:54.620
out to people, I would guess.

00:44:54.620 --> 00:44:55.920
Anyway, so yeah.

00:44:55.920 --> 00:44:58.490
That was a nice day to be out
on the ice sheet, blue sky.

00:44:58.490 --> 00:44:59.790
Blue on the top.

00:44:59.790 --> 00:45:01.090
White on the bottom.

00:45:01.090 --> 00:45:03.860
Pretty typical of what
it looks like down there.

00:45:03.860 --> 00:45:06.390
Yeah, so for NASA
studying the cryosphere,

00:45:06.390 --> 00:45:07.780
the future really is here.

00:45:07.780 --> 00:45:09.740
We've got two new missions.

00:45:09.740 --> 00:45:13.880
ICESat-2 has a required
lifetime,

00:45:13.880 --> 00:45:15.510
design lifetime of three years.

00:45:15.510 --> 00:45:18.490
We have fuel on board to go
a whole lot longer than that.

00:45:18.490 --> 00:45:21.150
And so far, the data
look really, really good.

00:45:21.150 --> 00:45:23.730
GRACE-Follow-On had
some initial hiccoughs

00:45:23.730 --> 00:45:25.600
in getting their
systems turned on.

00:45:25.600 --> 00:45:28.600
They had to switch from their
A-side instruments to some

00:45:28.600 --> 00:45:29.900
of their B-side instruments,

00:45:29.900 --> 00:45:31.490
but they started
collecting science data again

00:45:31.490 --> 00:45:34.140
about two weeks ago, about
the same time that we did.

00:45:34.140 --> 00:45:37.240
And hopefully, they'll get
their processing sorted out

00:45:37.240 --> 00:45:40.360
and start putting out
some good data, as well.

00:45:40.360 --> 00:45:43.850
Our data from NASA, from both
GRACE-Follow-On and ICESat-2,

00:45:43.850 --> 00:45:45.480
freely available to the public.

00:45:45.480 --> 00:45:48.070
We have a period where we
do checkout and calibration,

00:45:48.070 --> 00:45:49.850
but after that, it
goes to data centers

00:45:49.850 --> 00:45:51.750
that are open to the world.

00:45:51.750 --> 00:45:53.770
Our data center's
called the National Snow

00:45:53.770 --> 00:45:55.070
and Ice Data Center.

00:45:55.070 --> 00:45:56.930
You didn't know that we had
one of those, but we do.

00:45:56.930 --> 00:45:58.300
[laughter] It's in
Boulder, Colorado,

00:45:58.300 --> 00:46:01.340
and if you're interested
in cryospheric data,

00:46:01.340 --> 00:46:04.030
like that from ICESat or
ICESat-2, you can get it there.

00:46:04.030 --> 00:46:06.520
Anybody can.

00:46:06.520 --> 00:46:09.860
Typically the time from date
of data collection to the date

00:46:09.860 --> 00:46:13.710
that you can get it at the
data center is about 40 days.

00:46:13.710 --> 00:46:16.060
We're still in our
beginning phases.

00:46:16.060 --> 00:46:22.330
We just turned the laser on
for the first time 35 days ago.

00:46:22.330 --> 00:46:26.600
So but by January, we should be
into pretty normal operations.

00:46:26.600 --> 00:46:29.320
And all of you now are
super excited about ICESat-2

00:46:29.320 --> 00:46:31.670
and looking at your
house from space.

00:46:31.670 --> 00:46:32.980
[laughter] You can do it there.

00:46:32.980 --> 00:46:34.900
National Snow and
Ice Data Center.

00:46:34.900 --> 00:46:37.110
That's all I had, and I'm happy

00:46:37.110 --> 00:46:38.410
to take whatever
questions people have.

00:46:38.410 --> 00:46:40.210
Thanks very much for coming.

00:46:40.210 --> 00:46:46.060
[ Applause ]

00:46:46.060 --> 00:46:47.360
&gt;&gt; Stephanie Marcus: Okay,

00:46:47.360 --> 00:46:48.660
the house rule is
you ask the question,

00:46:48.660 --> 00:46:51.410
Tom will repeat it
and answer it.

00:46:51.410 --> 00:46:52.710
&gt;&gt; Dr. Tom Neumann: Ooh.

00:46:52.710 --> 00:46:54.010
&gt;&gt; Stephanie Marcus:
So we get it, you know,

00:46:54.010 --> 00:46:55.310
none of this, what did they say?

00:46:55.310 --> 00:46:56.610
What did they say?

00:46:56.610 --> 00:46:57.910
&gt;&gt; Dr. Tom Neumann: What
did they say, yeah, right.

00:46:57.910 --> 00:46:59.210
Please.

00:46:59.210 --> 00:47:00.510
&gt;&gt; Audience Member: Thanks.

00:47:00.510 --> 00:47:01.810
Thank you very much
for that presentation.

00:47:01.810 --> 00:47:03.660
I'm interested also
in other ways

00:47:03.660 --> 00:47:05.930
of acquiring ground
[inaudible] or --

00:47:05.930 --> 00:47:09.030
and the work that you
actually did are available

00:47:09.030 --> 00:47:13.560
to use earlier data from
known points in the Antarctic

00:47:13.560 --> 00:47:17.540
and [inaudible] to
check other places?

00:47:17.540 --> 00:47:19.540
&gt;&gt; Dr. Tom Neumann: Right, so
the question was, if we're --

00:47:19.540 --> 00:47:20.840
if I can paraphrase --

00:47:20.840 --> 00:47:24.430
are we able to use data
collected earlier from places

00:47:24.430 --> 00:47:27.070
like Greenland or
Antarctica or other places

00:47:27.070 --> 00:47:30.200
to check the quality
of the ICESat-2 data?

00:47:30.200 --> 00:47:32.570
And the answer is, sometimes.

00:47:32.570 --> 00:47:35.020
Greenland and Antarctica
do change through time.

00:47:35.020 --> 00:47:37.980
We know that they're changing
especially close to the edges.

00:47:37.980 --> 00:47:40.480
If you had data collected from
the middle of the ice sheet,

00:47:40.480 --> 00:47:43.470
which is changing
more slowly, then yes,

00:47:43.470 --> 00:47:45.130
we probably can use that.

00:47:45.130 --> 00:47:47.140
There are places on the earth

00:47:47.140 --> 00:47:51.610
that the rock elevation changes
either slowly or in a known way.

00:47:51.610 --> 00:47:54.480
You get these steady
uplift or subsidence.

00:47:54.480 --> 00:47:56.730
We can use that data as well.

00:47:56.730 --> 00:48:00.800
The piece I didn't mention
about our 88 south traverse is

00:48:00.800 --> 00:48:03.460
that we'll repeat
that survey every year

00:48:03.460 --> 00:48:05.270
that ICESat-2 is on orbit.

00:48:05.270 --> 00:48:07.630
So even if that middle part
of the ice sheet is changing,

00:48:07.630 --> 00:48:11.990
and it probably is, we should
be able to correct for that.

00:48:11.990 --> 00:48:15.130
That part of the ice sheet is
one of the more stable parts.

00:48:15.130 --> 00:48:17.120
The elevation change
there should be less

00:48:17.120 --> 00:48:19.070
than a centimeter a year.

00:48:19.070 --> 00:48:21.900
But we should be able
to correct out for that.

00:48:21.900 --> 00:48:25.930
So you could use and you can
use prior data, but you have

00:48:25.930 --> 00:48:28.540
to make sure you account for
how the earth has changed

00:48:28.540 --> 00:48:32.820
between when the data was
first collected and today.

00:48:32.820 --> 00:48:34.120
Yeah, in the back.

00:48:34.120 --> 00:48:35.850
&gt;&gt; Audience Member:
So this is ICESat-2.

00:48:35.850 --> 00:48:39.390
What's the difference
between it and ICESat-1?

00:48:39.390 --> 00:48:40.970
&gt;&gt; Dr. Tom Neumann: Question
was, this is ICESat-2.

00:48:40.970 --> 00:48:43.380
What's the difference
between it and ICESat-1.

00:48:43.380 --> 00:48:44.680
Whole bunch of good stuff.

00:48:44.680 --> 00:48:48.650
So ICESat-1 was on
orbit from 2003 to 2009.

00:48:48.650 --> 00:48:52.510
It was a single beam altimeter,
so it just had one spot.

00:48:52.510 --> 00:48:54.060
And its spot was pretty big.

00:48:54.060 --> 00:48:56.830
It was about 70 meters
in diameter.

00:48:56.830 --> 00:49:00.060
That laser fired about
40 times a second,

00:49:00.060 --> 00:49:03.090
so you'd get a footprint,
70 meter footprint

00:49:03.090 --> 00:49:05.660
about every 150 meters
along track.

00:49:05.660 --> 00:49:07.940
So you'd get one giant spot.

00:49:07.940 --> 00:49:10.990
Another 100 meters later,
you'd get another giant spot.

00:49:10.990 --> 00:49:14.900
And so for sea ice that
was really difficult to use

00:49:14.900 --> 00:49:17.320
because we couldn't detect
those individual leads

00:49:17.320 --> 00:49:21.390
that are sometimes a lot
smaller than 70 meters.

00:49:21.390 --> 00:49:23.750
And for ice sheets,
what would happen is

00:49:23.750 --> 00:49:27.980
with the big footprints
and the single track,

00:49:27.980 --> 00:49:30.950
we had a hard time
correcting for slope effects.

00:49:30.950 --> 00:49:34.800
So imagine if this room wasn't
flat, but it was tilted,

00:49:34.800 --> 00:49:37.480
and you're ranging to
this tilted surface,

00:49:37.480 --> 00:49:40.500
and you're getting an average
measurement over that slope.

00:49:40.500 --> 00:49:43.730
It was pretty hard to tease
out what's just an effect

00:49:43.730 --> 00:49:47.330
of the surface slope and what's
an effect of elevation change.

00:49:47.330 --> 00:49:49.550
That map of Greenland
I showed at the outset

00:49:49.550 --> 00:49:52.630
that had the color
codes along the edges,

00:49:52.630 --> 00:49:56.270
showing that there were changes
at the edges, we were able

00:49:56.270 --> 00:49:58.240
to detect those changes
because they were on the order

00:49:58.240 --> 00:49:59.540
of like, 10 meters a year.

00:49:59.540 --> 00:50:02.260
They were pretty big differences

00:50:02.260 --> 00:50:05.100
from each time ICESat
would go pass.

00:50:05.100 --> 00:50:07.620
But with ICESat-2, we'll
have these six beams

00:50:07.620 --> 00:50:09.490
that will let us take care
of those slope effects.

00:50:09.490 --> 00:50:12.210
They'll let us find those
leads much easier in sea ice,

00:50:12.210 --> 00:50:14.470
and should give us a
way more refined picture

00:50:14.470 --> 00:50:16.050
of how things are changing.

00:50:16.050 --> 00:50:18.240
But we learned a ton from
the first ICESat mission

00:50:18.240 --> 00:50:20.950
that really went into
designing ICESat-2.

00:50:22.260 --> 00:50:23.560
Yeah?

00:50:23.560 --> 00:50:24.860
&gt;&gt; Audience Member:
[inaudible] the photons

00:50:24.860 --> 00:50:26.910
that are transmitted
and make it back?

00:50:26.910 --> 00:50:28.670
&gt;&gt; Dr. Tom Neumann: The question
was what percent of the photons

00:50:28.670 --> 00:50:31.020
that are transmitted
make it back?

00:50:31.020 --> 00:50:36.520
To round it off to the first
ten significant figures, zero.

00:50:36.520 --> 00:50:39.320
[laughter] So we send out
about 300 trillion photons

00:50:39.320 --> 00:50:42.080
in each pulse, and we
get about one back.

00:50:42.080 --> 00:50:45.270
So it's about 1 part
in 300 trillion.

00:50:45.270 --> 00:50:46.570
So it's -- yeah,
you might say, oh!

00:50:46.570 --> 00:50:50.520
Well, all those wasted
photons are going for nothing.

00:50:50.520 --> 00:50:51.820
[laughter] Which is true.

00:50:51.820 --> 00:50:55.550
But what happens is
the beam spreads.

00:50:55.550 --> 00:50:57.620
There's some beam
divergence to it.

00:50:57.620 --> 00:51:00.250
And so the beam gets larger
and larger, it comes down.

00:51:00.250 --> 00:51:02.430
It's 17 meters when
it hits the earth.

00:51:02.430 --> 00:51:05.550
The earth doesn't reflect all
of the light back towards you.

00:51:05.550 --> 00:51:07.680
Some of the light's
going to go left or right

00:51:07.680 --> 00:51:09.140
or forward or backward.

00:51:09.140 --> 00:51:11.560
Clouds scatter a
lot of it, as well.

00:51:11.560 --> 00:51:13.750
And our field of view

00:51:13.750 --> 00:51:17.940
up in space is an 80
centimeter diameter telescope.

00:51:17.940 --> 00:51:21.000
So the field of view on the
ground is about 45 meters.

00:51:21.000 --> 00:51:24.340
So we're only detecting photons
that essentially go straight

00:51:24.340 --> 00:51:26.050
down and straight back again.

00:51:26.050 --> 00:51:27.700
A little to the left,
a little to the right,

00:51:27.700 --> 00:51:29.470
and we'll never see them.

00:51:29.470 --> 00:51:32.470
But yeah, most of
those are lost.

00:51:32.470 --> 00:51:34.440
Yeah, way in the back.

00:51:34.440 --> 00:51:36.080
&gt;&gt; Audience Member: If you're
typically getting one or two

00:51:36.080 --> 00:51:37.740
or three photons counted,

00:51:37.740 --> 00:51:40.280
how many do you get
on the corner cubes?

00:51:40.280 --> 00:51:41.580
&gt;&gt; Dr. Tom Neumann: Yeah.

00:51:41.580 --> 00:51:44.010
So those corner cubes,
we don't know yet.

00:51:44.010 --> 00:51:46.100
I've poked around a little bit
in the data looking for them,

00:51:46.100 --> 00:51:48.290
but it's kind of a
needle in a haystack.

00:51:48.290 --> 00:51:50.770
Our geolocation, if you will,

00:51:50.770 --> 00:51:53.840
how precisely we can assign
a latitude, a longitude,

00:51:53.840 --> 00:51:58.450
and a height, we're sort of on
version 1.1 of that algorithm,

00:51:58.450 --> 00:51:59.750
and we keep tuning it.

00:51:59.750 --> 00:52:01.720
So I haven't found
any data for it yet.

00:52:01.720 --> 00:52:05.190
We think they'll be on the
order of about 20 or 25.

00:52:05.190 --> 00:52:07.120
So it should look,
like, really bright,

00:52:07.120 --> 00:52:08.780
compared to everything
around it.

00:52:08.780 --> 00:52:11.550
And I put them up on poles that
were anywhere between a meter

00:52:11.550 --> 00:52:13.840
to two meters above the surface.

00:52:13.840 --> 00:52:15.290
So if you're zoomed
in far enough,

00:52:15.290 --> 00:52:16.590
you should see the flat ground,

00:52:16.590 --> 00:52:19.260
and then this super bright thing
two meters above the surface.

00:52:19.260 --> 00:52:22.400
And that'll be the corner cube.

00:52:22.400 --> 00:52:23.940
Yeah. Yeah?

00:52:23.940 --> 00:52:27.420
&gt;&gt; Audience Member: You made a
very brief allusion to forestry.

00:52:27.420 --> 00:52:28.720
&gt;&gt; Dr. Tom Neumann: Yes.

00:52:28.720 --> 00:52:30.880
&gt;&gt; Audience Member: And from
a climate change perspective,

00:52:30.880 --> 00:52:32.860
forest loss is probably
pretty --

00:52:32.860 --> 00:52:37.280
in the same order of
magnitude as ice loss.

00:52:37.280 --> 00:52:38.580
&gt;&gt; Dr. Tom Neumann: Yeah.

00:52:38.580 --> 00:52:41.570
&gt;&gt; Audience Member: Is there
any formal process put in place

00:52:41.570 --> 00:52:44.660
to have [inaudible] forests
management people look

00:52:44.660 --> 00:52:45.960
at this data?

00:52:45.960 --> 00:52:47.260
&gt;&gt; Dr. Tom Neumann: Yeah,

00:52:47.260 --> 00:52:49.440
we actually do have a data
product design that's the --

00:52:49.440 --> 00:52:52.000
we call it vegetation
canopy height.

00:52:52.000 --> 00:52:54.890
So we have algorithms in
place from simulated data

00:52:54.890 --> 00:52:57.190
to detect the ground below
the canopy, if we can,

00:52:57.190 --> 00:53:00.410
and then the top of the canopy
and take that difference.

00:53:00.410 --> 00:53:04.810
And that should let terrestrial
ecology folks get at biomass

00:53:04.810 --> 00:53:07.680
of forests in different places.

00:53:07.680 --> 00:53:11.750
We're not designed to do super
well at that measurement.

00:53:11.750 --> 00:53:15.650
And the limitation
for us is two-fold.

00:53:15.650 --> 00:53:18.460
One, if the canopy is really,
really dense, like you might get

00:53:18.460 --> 00:53:21.470
in Brazil, some triple
canopy rainforests,

00:53:21.470 --> 00:53:23.210
we just won't get any
photons down through

00:53:23.210 --> 00:53:24.640
to the ground and back again.

00:53:24.640 --> 00:53:26.200
So we'll measure
the top super well,

00:53:26.200 --> 00:53:28.420
but we won't know
where the ground is.

00:53:28.420 --> 00:53:30.760
On the other end of the
spectrum is a lone tree

00:53:30.760 --> 00:53:33.750
out in a field somewhere,
you know?

00:53:33.750 --> 00:53:35.960
And the canopy isn't
dense enough,

00:53:35.960 --> 00:53:37.860
you don't get enough
data to say, all right,

00:53:37.860 --> 00:53:40.360
here's a reliable measurement
of what the tree height is.

00:53:40.360 --> 00:53:42.960
We'll get the ground
super well in that case,

00:53:42.960 --> 00:53:44.260
but not the tree height.

00:53:44.260 --> 00:53:46.810
So there's a sweet
spot for us of forests

00:53:46.810 --> 00:53:50.790
like a deciduous forests,
we should do just fine.

00:53:50.790 --> 00:53:54.480
And then building up data
through time, leaf on, leaf off,

00:53:54.480 --> 00:53:55.940
maybe get a good measurement

00:53:55.940 --> 00:53:57.740
of when the leaves
are on, of the top.

00:53:57.740 --> 00:53:59.730
You get a better measurement of
the ground when leaves are off.

00:53:59.730 --> 00:54:02.660
You put those two together,
now you're in business.

00:54:02.660 --> 00:54:04.530
&gt;&gt; Audience Member:
Yeah, and then also,

00:54:04.530 --> 00:54:05.920
from a climate change
perspective,

00:54:05.920 --> 00:54:11.000
is the aggregate loss of
course, is crucially important

00:54:11.000 --> 00:54:15.050
and it looks like that data
ought to be able to help them.

00:54:15.050 --> 00:54:16.350
&gt;&gt; Dr. Tom Neumann: Yeah.

00:54:16.350 --> 00:54:17.650
It -- [inaudible] absolutely.

00:54:17.650 --> 00:54:20.070
And we do have a couple of
terrestrial ecology folks

00:54:20.070 --> 00:54:23.030
on our science team that are
working towards exactly that.

00:54:23.030 --> 00:54:25.310
We didn't know how well we
would do over forests for them,

00:54:25.310 --> 00:54:26.910
because we're not
really optimized for it.

00:54:26.910 --> 00:54:28.210
It's the wrong wavelength

00:54:28.210 --> 00:54:31.140
and a few other differences
that they'd prefer.

00:54:31.140 --> 00:54:32.960
But it's there and
it's not going

00:54:32.960 --> 00:54:35.400
to be perfect, but
it'll be helpful.

00:54:35.400 --> 00:54:36.700
Yeah?

00:54:36.700 --> 00:54:38.000
&gt;&gt; Audience Member: Are
you able to get any data

00:54:38.000 --> 00:54:40.390
on the changes of
the permafrost?

00:54:40.390 --> 00:54:43.040
&gt;&gt; Dr. Tom Neumann: The question
was, are we able to get data

00:54:43.040 --> 00:54:45.730
on changes in the permafrost?

00:54:45.730 --> 00:54:47.830
Yeah, we certainly should.

00:54:47.830 --> 00:54:50.640
Lots of areas, permafrost
is melting.

00:54:50.640 --> 00:54:54.080
And what you see when that
permafrost is two things,

00:54:54.080 --> 00:54:57.810
the surface goes down because
the ice that's in there melts

00:54:57.810 --> 00:55:01.010
and returns to the water
table or to the ocean.

00:55:01.010 --> 00:55:03.260
And two, you get ponding.

00:55:03.260 --> 00:55:05.500
So we'll be able to
measure the heights

00:55:05.500 --> 00:55:06.990
of those water bodies
pretty well.

00:55:06.990 --> 00:55:10.540
We'll be able to tell when
something has gone from wet

00:55:10.540 --> 00:55:13.410
to dry or dry to wet,
in the case of melting.

00:55:13.410 --> 00:55:17.070
We don't have a data product
specifically for permafrost,

00:55:17.070 --> 00:55:19.990
but we have one person on
the team who's interested

00:55:19.990 --> 00:55:22.700
in that aspect, and that's
kind of his main focus,

00:55:22.700 --> 00:55:25.270
is trying to measure
permafrost changes.

00:55:25.270 --> 00:55:28.220
So we think we should be able to
do something for them, as well.

00:55:29.340 --> 00:55:30.640
Yeah, in the back?

00:55:30.640 --> 00:55:31.940
&gt;&gt; Audience Member: Why are
you guys using green light

00:55:31.940 --> 00:55:33.810
and not a different --

00:55:33.810 --> 00:55:35.110
&gt;&gt; Dr. Tom Neumann:
Different wavelength?

00:55:35.110 --> 00:55:36.410
&gt;&gt; Audience Member:
What's the reasoning?

00:55:36.410 --> 00:55:37.710
&gt;&gt; Dr. Tom Neumann: Yeah.

00:55:37.710 --> 00:55:39.010
So the question is, why do
we use green light as opposed

00:55:39.010 --> 00:55:40.310
to any other wavelength.

00:55:40.310 --> 00:55:42.620
The first ICESat
used infrared light.

00:55:42.620 --> 00:55:46.210
It turns out infrared
lasers are more efficient

00:55:46.210 --> 00:55:49.300
at taking electrical energy
and turning it into light,

00:55:49.300 --> 00:55:51.460
which is a consideration.

00:55:51.460 --> 00:55:52.760
We ended up choosing green

00:55:52.760 --> 00:55:56.600
to optimize the overall energy
efficiency of the whole design.

00:55:56.600 --> 00:55:58.460
So when you're making
green laser light,

00:55:58.460 --> 00:56:00.680
you're essentially
taking infrared light

00:56:00.680 --> 00:56:03.860
and doubling its frequency
and you have a loss there,

00:56:03.860 --> 00:56:05.280
as well, a pretty big one.

00:56:05.280 --> 00:56:08.600
But on the detection side,
the detectors in the green are

00:56:08.600 --> 00:56:13.340
about 15% efficient, whereas
the detectors in infrared, A,

00:56:13.340 --> 00:56:16.870
weren't space qualified
yet, and B,

00:56:16.870 --> 00:56:19.540
were about a half
of 1% efficient.

00:56:19.540 --> 00:56:23.030
So we got about an order
of magnitude or two better

00:56:23.030 --> 00:56:24.630
on the detection side,

00:56:24.630 --> 00:56:27.830
even though we had this
penalty on the transmit side.

00:56:27.830 --> 00:56:29.130
But you put those two together,

00:56:29.130 --> 00:56:32.280
and it made green a
better choice for us.

00:56:33.670 --> 00:56:34.970
Yeah?

00:56:34.970 --> 00:56:36.270
&gt;&gt; Audience Member: The
National Weather Service uses

00:56:36.270 --> 00:56:38.240
about 8,000 volunteers
to measure snow depth.

00:56:38.240 --> 00:56:39.540
&gt;&gt; Dr. Tom Neumann: Yeah.

00:56:39.540 --> 00:56:40.870
&gt;&gt; Audience Member: What's
the implications of this

00:56:40.870 --> 00:56:42.970
for that measurement
of snow depth?

00:56:42.970 --> 00:56:44.270
&gt;&gt; Dr. Tom Neumann: Yeah.

00:56:44.270 --> 00:56:47.860
So the question was the National
-- National Weather Service?

00:56:47.860 --> 00:56:50.870
Yeah. Uses volunteers to measure
snow depth all over the place.

00:56:50.870 --> 00:56:53.620
What can ICESat-2 do for them?

00:56:53.620 --> 00:56:54.920
It's a good question.

00:56:54.920 --> 00:56:56.410
So we have our six beams.

00:56:56.410 --> 00:57:00.950
They repeat every 91 days, so
we should go through a place

00:57:00.950 --> 00:57:03.260
like Wisconsin, where
I'm from, in the summer,

00:57:03.260 --> 00:57:04.560
and you get a good measurement

00:57:04.560 --> 00:57:06.660
of the surface without
snow on it.

00:57:06.660 --> 00:57:10.200
And then we come through 91 days
later, maybe it's October yes,

00:57:10.200 --> 00:57:12.690
it already started
snowing there.

00:57:12.690 --> 00:57:14.520
So if you're there after a
snowfall, you should be able

00:57:14.520 --> 00:57:16.750
to take those two
elevation measurements,

00:57:16.750 --> 00:57:19.520
take the difference,
and get the snow depth.

00:57:19.520 --> 00:57:21.570
It's just a height,
and as I understand it,

00:57:21.570 --> 00:57:24.440
what a lot of their interested
in is snow water equivalent,

00:57:24.440 --> 00:57:26.170
how much water is in there.

00:57:26.170 --> 00:57:28.870
But at least getting that height
difference between snow on

00:57:28.870 --> 00:57:31.880
and snow off should
be useful for them.

00:57:31.880 --> 00:57:36.750
There's a group called -- ooh,
their mission is called SnowX

00:57:36.750 --> 00:57:40.580
and they're working
to come up with a way

00:57:40.580 --> 00:57:43.820
to measure snow water
equivalent from space

00:57:43.820 --> 00:57:45.120
for about a decade from now.

00:57:45.120 --> 00:57:46.840
So they're just at
the beginning.

00:57:46.840 --> 00:57:49.200
So they're super interested
in our data to get a map

00:57:49.200 --> 00:57:51.690
of what snow depth is like.

00:57:51.690 --> 00:57:53.850
A place like Wisconsin,
it's relatively easy

00:57:53.850 --> 00:57:56.560
because it's farm fields,
it's relatively flat.

00:57:56.560 --> 00:57:59.260
A place like the Rocky
Mountains or Sierra Nevada,

00:57:59.260 --> 00:58:03.200
where there's steep slopes,
is going to be a lot harder

00:58:03.200 --> 00:58:06.180
because you're pointing and
your geolocation have to be

00:58:06.180 --> 00:58:09.410
that much better to know if you
were -- on some steep slope,

00:58:09.410 --> 00:58:11.770
to know if you were here or you
were here, because you'd say,

00:58:11.770 --> 00:58:15.030
okay, this snow pack is one
meter or it's ten meters.

00:58:15.030 --> 00:58:19.690
Because just because that slope
of that ground is so severe.

00:58:19.690 --> 00:58:21.690
Yeah. We're not optimized
for it, but we should be able

00:58:21.690 --> 00:58:22.990
to help there, as well.

00:58:22.990 --> 00:58:25.290
At least in some circumstances.

00:58:26.820 --> 00:58:29.440
Cool. Anything else?

00:58:29.440 --> 00:58:30.740
&gt;&gt; Stephanie Marcus: Okay.

00:58:30.740 --> 00:58:32.070
Well, thank you for coming.

00:58:32.070 --> 00:58:33.370
&gt;&gt; Dr. Tom Neumann: Awesome.

00:58:33.370 --> 00:58:34.670
Thanks very much.
