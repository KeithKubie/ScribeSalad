00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.070
It can be painfully easy to hit what we call a crisis of meaning.

00:00:03.070 --> 00:00:05.070
It can be painfully easy to hit what we call a crisis of meaning.

00:00:05.070 --> 00:00:07.070
In these moments we feel the following:

00:00:07.070 --> 00:00:08.935
What I am doing makes no sense.

00:00:08.940 --> 00:00:11.940
I am not contributing to anything. I am living day to day

00:00:11.940 --> 00:00:15.500
repeating things for a logic I just don't understand.

00:00:15.880 --> 00:00:18.560
At such points, it can help to step back,

00:00:18.580 --> 00:00:21.440
and consider something we don't usually address.

00:00:21.480 --> 00:00:26.500
What is the meaning of existence for the species as a whole?

00:00:26.680 --> 00:00:31.580
What is the underlying narrative logic for the mess, full starts, occasional progress,

00:00:31.640 --> 00:00:34.060
and fitful path of human history?

00:00:34.120 --> 00:00:38.640
The 200 thousand year old history of Homo Sapiens.

00:00:38.640 --> 00:00:41.800
By this we of course don't mean a God given meaning.

00:00:41.800 --> 00:00:45.820
We mean a logic that drives human behaviour at its best.

00:00:45.940 --> 00:00:49.080
The most generous interpretation of what knits human action,

00:00:49.080 --> 00:00:52.100
when it isn't driven by evil motives.

00:00:52.160 --> 00:00:56.220
Here we can make the following rather bold declarations:

00:00:56.220 --> 00:01:00.140
There are four drivers of meaning in the human race.

00:01:00.140 --> 00:01:03.160
Firstly, to continue the species.

00:01:03.160 --> 00:01:07.480
Secondly, to master our minds - understand ourselves.

00:01:07.480 --> 00:01:13.065
Thirdly, to master our environment - increasing our command over it through knowledge,

00:01:13.065 --> 00:01:17.420
control of resources, and reduction of the role of accident and misfortune.

00:01:17.940 --> 00:01:21.040
And fourthly, the increase of our satisfaction.

00:01:21.360 --> 00:01:26.100
These vast headings help to explain a lot of our day to day activity.

00:01:26.320 --> 00:01:29.080
Take the human drive of continuing the species.

00:01:29.080 --> 00:01:31.920
Which explains parenting, courtship, love.

00:01:32.020 --> 00:01:35.480
Take mastering our minds, and understanding ourselves.

00:01:35.480 --> 00:01:39.780
That explains philosophy, psychology, education, even media.

00:01:39.780 --> 00:01:45.500
Mastering the environment. That explains business, defense, science, architecture.

00:01:45.500 --> 00:01:51.220
And as for our quest for happiness, this explains religion, culture, art.

00:01:51.300 --> 00:01:55.680
It is because of our need to master the environment that we store up capital.

00:01:55.780 --> 00:02:00.580
It is because we are collectively engaged in continuing the species that we become parents.

00:02:00.620 --> 00:02:05.200
It is in order to reduce the role of random accidents that we have science.

00:02:05.460 --> 00:02:09.100
Crucially these four drives are vast collective movements.

00:02:09.100 --> 00:02:14.160
And no one human ever makes more than a tiny contribution to any of them.

00:02:14.200 --> 00:02:17.500
From a sufficient distance, even the so called 'great names',

00:02:17.500 --> 00:02:20.615
Shakespeare and Newton, Eistein and John F Kennedy.

00:02:20.620 --> 00:02:25.460
Only ever add a little bit to the unfolding river of humanity.

00:02:25.460 --> 00:02:28.900
The greatest might adjust its course by a millimetre.

00:02:29.080 --> 00:02:34.220
Naturally, in relation to the mighty goals of humanity, each of us is puny,

00:02:34.220 --> 00:02:40.240
and therefore measuring our contribution individually is bound to leave us defeated.

00:02:40.420 --> 00:02:41.940
We shouldn't be doing this.

00:02:42.120 --> 00:02:48.520
We should think that we are but temporary actors of a species with broadly collective goals.

00:02:48.540 --> 00:02:54.140
Though our goals can feel very personal to us, when for example we're building up our own business,

00:02:54.280 --> 00:03:00.520
we're just partaking in the species will to master the environment and husband resources for a while.

00:03:00.920 --> 00:03:03.920
The history of humanity unfolds in time.

00:03:03.920 --> 00:03:06.840
We only ever make our contribution at one moment.

00:03:06.840 --> 00:03:09.000
And the changing circumstances

00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:13.200
mean that our achievements do risk seeming absurd at another point in time.

00:03:13.260 --> 00:03:18.140
A very important nobleman in 14th century England is mere dust now.

00:03:18.160 --> 00:03:21.840
We remember almost no human who lived in the 11th century.

00:03:21.840 --> 00:03:25.160
Almost nothing stands out in the whole of 9th century.

00:03:25.380 --> 00:03:28.620
All those people who lived and died are as nothing.

00:03:28.655 --> 00:03:31.365
This is similar to what will happen to us today.

00:03:31.365 --> 00:03:35.000
We can tell by looking backwards and anticipating forwards

00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:39.960
that very little of what we do could conceivably have much of an impact.

00:03:40.060 --> 00:03:47.220
Nevertheless, we can, at best, see ourselves as making a contribution to the goals of humankind.

00:03:47.220 --> 00:03:51.560
Maybe over a lifetime we'll collect a few resources.

00:03:51.620 --> 00:03:54.780
We'll understand a few bits of the puzzle of the mind.

00:03:54.860 --> 00:03:57.860
We'll have children, who'll have children, who'll have children.

00:03:57.860 --> 00:04:01.160
We'll alleviate the suffering of a few other people.

00:04:01.380 --> 00:04:05.460
It won't be much on its own. But we shouldn't measure it on its own.

00:04:05.460 --> 00:04:07.815
That is the sickness of individualism.

00:04:07.820 --> 00:04:13.140
We have to measure it against the broad stream of what humanity is up to.

00:04:13.280 --> 00:04:16.700
In James Joyce's 'Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man',

00:04:16.960 --> 00:04:21.600
there is a charming moment where Stephen Deadalus who's nine years old and central character

00:04:21.760 --> 00:04:25.920
writes his name on a geography book on a way to position him in space.

00:04:25.920 --> 00:04:30.900
He begins, Stephen Dedalus, Class of Elements, Clangauces Wood College

00:04:31.000 --> 00:04:37.020
Sallins, County Kildare, Ireland, Europe, the World, the Universe.

00:04:37.080 --> 00:04:40.795
All of us exist in these kind of multiple dimensions.

00:04:40.800 --> 00:04:46.160
The immediate, the class we're in, our name. And the grand, within the universe.

00:04:46.220 --> 00:04:50.860
We need to do a version of this positioning exercise, except we are not looking for

00:04:50.860 --> 00:04:54.600
geographical positioning, we are looking for purpose positioning.

00:04:54.600 --> 00:05:00.080
None of us is going to make a huge contribution to the history of the meaning of the species.

00:05:00.080 --> 00:05:03.980
We will just tinker with one or two elements.

00:05:03.980 --> 00:05:07.975
We'll have kids, we will make a bit of money, we will understand one or two things.

00:05:07.975 --> 00:05:10.455
So we have to take species pride.

00:05:10.455 --> 00:05:13.755
And reconcile ourselves to our smallness in the larger scheme.

00:05:13.760 --> 00:05:18.440
But it can still help us to know that a connection exists between what we are up to

00:05:18.440 --> 00:05:21.920
and what the grand story of humanity means.

00:05:21.920 --> 00:05:26.880
If today you made some money, that's connected to humanity attempting to master its environment.

00:05:26.880 --> 00:05:29.420
If today you looked after some children

00:05:29.420 --> 00:05:32.880
you'll have furthered in a tiny way the survivor of the species.

00:05:32.940 --> 00:05:35.120
If today you taught someone something,

00:05:35.120 --> 00:05:38.540
you'll have continued our attempt to understand the human condition.

00:05:38.540 --> 00:05:40.475
If today you tied up the house,

00:05:40.480 --> 00:05:45.280
you helped to make life be slightly less random and accident prone.

00:05:45.280 --> 00:05:46.820
What we call being depressed

00:05:46.820 --> 00:05:51.320
means not being able to find oneself on the grid of meaning.

00:05:51.320 --> 00:05:56.400
Not being able to plot one's own coordinates on the map of the meaning of humanity.

00:05:56.400 --> 00:05:59.940
But if we look the right way, everything can be connected.

00:06:00.000 --> 00:06:05.880
One is almost always in some way helping to continue and enhance the project of our species.

00:06:05.880 --> 00:06:08.480
We just need to get better at spotting meaning.

00:06:08.480 --> 00:06:14.580
At narrating the meaning of ones life in relation to the meaning of the whole species.

00:06:15.500 --> 00:06:19.560
