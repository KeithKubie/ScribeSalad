00:00:12.700 --> 00:00:14.620
So what would you like to see:

00:00:14.620 --> 00:00:18.000
A sequel to Disney's Tarzan, one of the biggest Summer hits when it came out,

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:21.500
Or... just three episodes of a cartoon pilot series strung together and saying

00:00:21.500 --> 00:00:23.300
"That makes it a movie!"

00:00:23.300 --> 00:00:25.300
Well, you got the goddamn latter.

00:00:25.300 --> 00:00:28.600
Give Tarzan and Jane credit that it's not called Tarzan 2. No, no--

00:00:28.700 --> 00:00:30.200
We get that later.

00:00:30.200 --> 00:00:34.200
It's at least not pretending that this is supposed to be a flowing cinematic followup.

00:00:34.200 --> 00:00:37.100
But, with that said, why even watch it?

00:00:37.100 --> 00:00:40.000
This is another anthology of stories that aren't really interesting,

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:41.500
are usually pointless,

00:00:41.500 --> 00:00:43.100
doesn't have the same animation,

00:00:43.100 --> 00:00:44.800
doesn't have the same voice actors--

00:00:44.800 --> 00:00:46.700
They couldn't even get Phil Collins back,

00:00:46.700 --> 00:00:50.900
they just replay one of his songs in the opening and then have a completely different artist at the end sing 'em out.

00:00:50.900 --> 00:00:52.600
Are the stories tied together?

00:00:52.600 --> 00:00:55.800
Eeeeh, about as well as Cinderella 2 ties them together.

00:00:55.800 --> 00:00:59.600
Jane is excited because it's the one year anniversary of Tarzan marrying her,

00:00:59.600 --> 00:01:02.300
so she's trying to figure out the best way to celebrate.

00:01:02.300 --> 00:01:07.000
Buuut every idea she comes up with seems to have a really annoying story attached to it.

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:11.900
The first story is about her friends coming back from England trying to save her even though she doesn't need saving,

00:01:11.900 --> 00:01:17.000
the second is about some evil guys who come to the island who trick Tarzan into trying to show them where some diamonds are--

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:20.000
"NOO, no. The dIAMOnds arE HERE!"

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:25.500
-- and the third story is about YET ANOTHER A**HOLE who comes to the island just to make things hard!

00:01:25.500 --> 00:01:30.100
The moral of the story is anyone who comes to the island not wearing a dress is gonna be a dick!

00:01:30.100 --> 00:01:35.200
What makes these especially funny is that everybody knows the story that's being told.

00:01:35.200 --> 00:01:39.000
Oh, I don't mean the audience though. We can guess everything that's gonna happen too!

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:40.400
I'm talking about the characters!

00:01:40.400 --> 00:01:43.800
They literally know everything that happens, they LIVE through it,

00:01:43.800 --> 00:01:47.000
yet, for some reason they're sitting down and talking about it.

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:49.200
Some of them don't even end with the same storyteller!

00:01:49.200 --> 00:01:53.700
One of them starts off with Jane telling the story and then ends with the elephant finishing it!

00:01:53.700 --> 00:01:55.700
What the hell happened in between?!

00:01:55.700 --> 00:02:01.400
As you can tell from the animation, this doesn't look especially cinematic, it looks more like a TV series.

00:02:01.400 --> 00:02:03.400
Which... it eventually became.

00:02:03.400 --> 00:02:08.300
This was all just a test to see if kids would watch Tarzan and Jane in several different stories.

00:02:08.300 --> 00:02:10.300
Well guess what, people don't want a test.

00:02:10.300 --> 00:02:12.900
They want a MOVIE, they want a SHOW.

00:02:12.900 --> 00:02:14.900
PICK ONE and BE IT.

00:02:14.900 --> 00:02:20.800
I guess for a TV show the animation isn't that bad, I mean if I saw it on TV I think it'd be totally acceptable.

00:02:20.800 --> 00:02:24.400
The quality of the voice replacements though rarely sound like the original.

00:02:24.400 --> 00:02:26.600
In fact, some even sound a little uncomfortable.

00:02:26.600 --> 00:02:29.200
The only thing more annoying than Rosie O'Donnell's voice

00:02:29.200 --> 00:02:31.500
is somebody IMPERSONATING Rosie O'Donnell's voice.

00:02:31.600 --> 00:02:35.500
"I was THERE I SAAAW the APES, alright?!"

00:02:35.500 --> 00:02:38.900
Everybody sounds a little off, that is except for Jane.

00:02:38.900 --> 00:02:44.000
While you know it's not Minnie Driver, whoever does the voice acting actually brought kinda this unique energy to it.

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:47.800
On top of that, Elaine's boss plays one of the villains. Now that's just IDEAL acting.

00:02:47.800 --> 00:02:50.900
Aaaand sometimes the friends get a little bit of a laugh too...

00:02:50.900 --> 00:02:54.100
I dunno I think it's just the people doing the impersonations that are a little odd.

00:02:54.100 --> 00:02:56.700
Not the worst, just... kind of awkward.

00:02:56.700 --> 00:02:59.000
It's made even more awkward by some of these lines.

00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:04.400
This one woman clearly has an attraction to Tarzan and talks about how hot it would be if he was in a CAGE.

00:03:04.400 --> 00:03:07.500
"Jane, perhaps you could put it back in its cage now..."

00:03:07.500 --> 00:03:09.700
"Cage? He's got a cage?" c;

00:03:09.700 --> 00:03:11.700
Eeeh, that was weird.

00:03:11.700 --> 00:03:15.700
Nothing about Tarzan and Jane feels big, authentic, or genuine.

00:03:15.700 --> 00:03:19.200
And if you look on the back or watch a preview you can catch onto that very quickly.

00:03:19.200 --> 00:03:20.600
It is what it is:

00:03:20.600 --> 00:03:23.800
A quick cash-in to see if they can launch this Disney series.

00:03:23.800 --> 00:03:28.000
It looks that way, it plays that way, is it even worth getting that angry over?

00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:30.000
It's a waste of time some kids might enjoy...

00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:33.800
But I think everybody can agree is entirely pointless.
