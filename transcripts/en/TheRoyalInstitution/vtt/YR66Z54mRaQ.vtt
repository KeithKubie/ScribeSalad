00:00:09.174 --> 00:00:10.340
Well good evening, everyone.

00:00:10.340 --> 00:00:11.910
It's great to see you here.

00:00:11.910 --> 00:00:16.470
I am very, very excited
about tonight because I have,

00:00:16.470 --> 00:00:19.090
surrounding me here,
an illustrious panel

00:00:19.090 --> 00:00:23.190
of some of the world's best--
and some of the world's

00:00:23.190 --> 00:00:27.670
most important, I should say--
particle accelerator physicists

00:00:27.670 --> 00:00:30.240
who are working on
the next generation

00:00:30.240 --> 00:00:32.450
after the Large Hadron Collider.

00:00:32.450 --> 00:00:36.900
So just to get a little bit
of a status of where we're at,

00:00:36.900 --> 00:00:39.140
can I see a show of
hands for how many of you

00:00:39.140 --> 00:00:41.453
have heard of the Large
Hadron Collider before?

00:00:41.453 --> 00:00:42.380
[LAUGHTER]

00:00:42.380 --> 00:00:44.460
Good, the media
has done its job.

00:00:44.460 --> 00:00:45.080
Excellent.

00:00:45.080 --> 00:00:46.930
OK, so my name is Susie Sheehy.

00:00:46.930 --> 00:00:48.620
Thank you, Martin,
for the introduction.

00:00:48.620 --> 00:00:51.530
I'm an accelerator physicist
at the University of Oxford.

00:00:51.530 --> 00:00:53.556
And I tend to design
smaller machines

00:00:53.556 --> 00:00:54.930
for different
applications, which

00:00:54.930 --> 00:00:57.300
is what a lot of our
project, called Accelerators

00:00:57.300 --> 00:00:59.470
for Humanity, has been about.

00:00:59.470 --> 00:01:02.010
But we couldn't be talking
about particle accelerators

00:01:02.010 --> 00:01:04.379
unless we really
brought out the big guns

00:01:04.379 --> 00:01:07.660
and talked about accelerators
for particle physics.

00:01:07.660 --> 00:01:10.300
So I think you're aware
already that the Large Hadron

00:01:10.300 --> 00:01:14.050
Collider is the highest
energy hadron-- that

00:01:14.050 --> 00:01:16.570
is, proton collider--
ever built--

00:01:16.570 --> 00:01:19.470
27 kilometers in circumference,
underneath the border

00:01:19.470 --> 00:01:22.970
between France and
Switzerland, near Geneva.

00:01:22.970 --> 00:01:27.340
And it is doing a fantastic
job at colliding protons

00:01:27.340 --> 00:01:30.870
together and uncovering the
secrets of the universe.

00:01:30.870 --> 00:01:34.540
But I'm often asked, when I talk
about particle accelerators,

00:01:34.540 --> 00:01:36.930
well, what's going to come next?

00:01:36.930 --> 00:01:39.750
What is the next big
thing after the LHC?

00:01:39.750 --> 00:01:42.310
And that is, effectively,
what we're here to talk about.

00:01:42.310 --> 00:01:44.130
So the four people I
have surrounding me,

00:01:44.130 --> 00:01:46.610
I'll just give you a quick
introduction to each of them.

00:01:46.610 --> 00:01:48.770
And then I'm going to
ask them to introduce

00:01:48.770 --> 00:01:53.510
their kind of pet project,
or their ideas on what

00:01:53.510 --> 00:01:55.950
might be coming after the
Large Hadron Collider.

00:01:55.950 --> 00:01:58.700
So first, on your
left, my right,

00:01:58.700 --> 00:02:00.360
is professor Phil Burrows.

00:02:00.360 --> 00:02:04.290
Phil is a professor in physics
at the University of Oxford

00:02:04.290 --> 00:02:06.870
and he's also the associate
director of the John Adams

00:02:06.870 --> 00:02:09.020
Institute for accelerated
science, which

00:02:09.020 --> 00:02:11.300
is one of two accelerated
institutes in the UK.

00:02:11.300 --> 00:02:13.300
And it's also the
one that I work in.

00:02:13.300 --> 00:02:17.310
(LAUGHING) So Phils's
actually in my department.

00:02:17.310 --> 00:02:21.070
So Phil actually did his degree
and PhD in particle physics,

00:02:21.070 --> 00:02:23.050
first at Oxford Uni.

00:02:23.050 --> 00:02:26.470
And then he actually move to the
USA for about a decade working

00:02:26.470 --> 00:02:28.780
at MIT, and on SLAC,
the linear collider,

00:02:28.780 --> 00:02:31.270
which was the first
electron-positron collider

00:02:31.270 --> 00:02:32.900
in the world.

00:02:32.900 --> 00:02:36.550
He then returned to Oxford,
then became a Professor

00:02:36.550 --> 00:02:37.980
at Queen Mary
University, and then

00:02:37.980 --> 00:02:40.840
came back to Oxford again--
you've spent a lot of time

00:02:40.840 --> 00:02:44.190
at Oxford, Phil-- as a professor
and in his current position

00:02:44.190 --> 00:02:46.140
as director of the John Adams.

00:02:46.140 --> 00:02:50.440
So Phil has been PI-- that
is, Principal Investigator--

00:02:50.440 --> 00:02:53.920
of the UK'S team on linear
electron-positron collider

00:02:53.920 --> 00:02:57.580
development and working on the
international linear collider

00:02:57.580 --> 00:02:59.704
and the compact
linear collider, which

00:02:59.704 --> 00:03:01.870
he'll explain a little bit
more about what those two

00:03:01.870 --> 00:03:03.270
projects are.

00:03:03.270 --> 00:03:06.650
He's been Principal Investigator
of the CLIC UK collaboration

00:03:06.650 --> 00:03:11.110
since 2011, and since 2014
has been the spokesperson

00:03:11.110 --> 00:03:14.020
of the CLIC-- that is,
Compact Linear Accelerator

00:03:14.020 --> 00:03:16.420
Collaboration-- which
involves about 300 people,

00:03:16.420 --> 00:03:20.290
60 institutes, and 31
countries around the world.

00:03:20.290 --> 00:03:21.752
All right, so that's Phil.

00:03:21.752 --> 00:03:22.710
Could you welcome Phil?

00:03:22.710 --> 00:03:23.570
Give him a round of applause.

00:03:23.570 --> 00:03:24.321
Thank you.

00:03:24.321 --> 00:03:27.480
[APPLAUSE]

00:03:28.280 --> 00:03:29.250
OK.

00:03:29.250 --> 00:03:32.860
So the next person on the
line is Dr. Frank Zimmermann.

00:03:32.860 --> 00:03:34.640
Now I'm particularly
excited to have Frank

00:03:34.640 --> 00:03:36.765
here because Frank's actually
come all the way over

00:03:36.765 --> 00:03:37.280
from CERN.

00:03:37.280 --> 00:03:40.550
Frank is a senior scientist at
CERN in the Accelerator Beams

00:03:40.550 --> 00:03:43.390
department, which is obviously
the home of the Large Hadron

00:03:43.390 --> 00:03:44.680
Collider.

00:03:44.680 --> 00:03:47.800
Frank has worked, it seems,
on just about every project--

00:03:47.800 --> 00:03:51.520
major project
going, did his Ph.D

00:03:51.520 --> 00:03:54.330
at the University of Hamburg
on a machine called HERA, which

00:03:54.330 --> 00:03:57.460
is a proton ring, and has worked
at major labs around the world,

00:03:57.460 --> 00:04:00.150
including DESY in
Germany, SLAK in the US,

00:04:00.150 --> 00:04:03.980
and has worked at CERN
from 1999, I believe.

00:04:03.980 --> 00:04:06.800
So frank has published textbooks
in accelerated physics,

00:04:06.800 --> 00:04:09.610
wrote the handbook, he's the
editor of the main journal

00:04:09.610 --> 00:04:12.280
in the accelerated field-- The
Physical Review Accelerator,

00:04:12.280 --> 00:04:14.571
and Beams-- I know you're
going to rush out and read it

00:04:14.571 --> 00:04:15.910
right now.

00:04:15.910 --> 00:04:16.410
It's good.

00:04:16.410 --> 00:04:17.810
It's a good read, Frank.

00:04:17.810 --> 00:04:19.570
It's good.

00:04:19.570 --> 00:04:22.350
He's also a coordinator
of a work package of one

00:04:22.350 --> 00:04:24.110
of the major
European coordination

00:04:24.110 --> 00:04:28.020
in accelerator research and
development, called EuCARD.

00:04:28.020 --> 00:04:29.930
The work package is
called Extreme Beams,

00:04:29.930 --> 00:04:33.830
which is kind of cool-- I
like it-- and since 2014,

00:04:33.830 --> 00:04:36.910
has also been deputy coordinator
of the CERN-hosted Future

00:04:36.910 --> 00:04:39.900
Circular Collider Study,
which is mostly, I think,

00:04:39.900 --> 00:04:41.890
what you'll be addressing
tonight, hopefully.

00:04:41.890 --> 00:04:43.296
So please, welcome Frank.

00:04:43.296 --> 00:04:46.346
[APPLAUSE]

00:04:48.080 --> 00:04:50.530
OK, so first on my
left, you're right,

00:04:50.530 --> 00:04:52.570
this is Professor
Ken Long who is

00:04:52.570 --> 00:04:56.990
a professor of particle physics
at Imperial College in London.

00:04:56.990 --> 00:04:59.710
And he's done a
lot of work at CERN

00:04:59.710 --> 00:05:03.760
on muon-proton scattering as a
graduate student, apparently,

00:05:03.760 --> 00:05:09.560
and then returned to the
UK to join an experiment

00:05:09.560 --> 00:05:10.590
at DESY in Hamburg.

00:05:10.590 --> 00:05:13.230
In fact, these two discovered
they were almost colleagues

00:05:13.230 --> 00:05:17.064
at DESY by-- one year,
I think we discovered?--

00:05:17.064 --> 00:05:19.480
and has contributed to the
design and construction of that

00:05:19.480 --> 00:05:23.170
experiment-- so that's
particle physics experiment.

00:05:23.170 --> 00:05:25.420
Now Ken got fascinated
by the discovery

00:05:25.420 --> 00:05:27.580
of neutrino oscillations
at one point in career.

00:05:27.580 --> 00:05:30.600
And your career seems
to have turned direction

00:05:30.600 --> 00:05:34.020
and really focus on neutrinos
and muons since that time.

00:05:34.020 --> 00:05:36.610
So Ken chairs the
international design study

00:05:36.610 --> 00:05:39.190
for a machine called the
Neutrino Factory, which

00:05:39.190 --> 00:05:41.920
hopefully we'll hear more
about, and is spokesman

00:05:41.920 --> 00:05:44.760
for an experiment called
the Muon Ionization Cooling

00:05:44.760 --> 00:05:47.400
Experiment, which is being
carried out at the Rutherford

00:05:47.400 --> 00:05:51.150
Appleton lab in
Oxfordshire-- and is also

00:05:51.150 --> 00:05:53.300
chair of the International
Committee for Future

00:05:53.300 --> 00:05:55.010
Accelerators, Neutrino Panel.

00:05:55.010 --> 00:05:59.467
So Ken focuses mostly on
neutrino and muon accelerators

00:05:59.467 --> 00:06:00.050
at the moment.

00:06:00.050 --> 00:06:01.720
So please, welcome Ken.

00:06:06.610 --> 00:06:10.310
And finally, but by no means
least, Stuart Mangles-- Dr.

00:06:10.310 --> 00:06:12.240
Stuart Mangles, on
my far left here,

00:06:12.240 --> 00:06:15.270
is a senior lecturer in physics
at Imperial College London

00:06:15.270 --> 00:06:17.401
where he also did his PhD.

00:06:17.401 --> 00:06:19.650
And he is a faculty member
of the John Adams Institute

00:06:19.650 --> 00:06:21.190
as well, I should say.

00:06:21.190 --> 00:06:25.440
Now Stuart's focus is a little
different from the other four

00:06:25.440 --> 00:06:26.610
of us here, in fact.

00:06:26.610 --> 00:06:29.860
In that, he's actually, by
definition, a plasma physicist,

00:06:29.860 --> 00:06:30.360
I suppose.

00:06:30.360 --> 00:06:33.330
So he researches
plasma-based accelerators.

00:06:33.330 --> 00:06:35.960
And he's been doing that
for the past 15 years

00:06:35.960 --> 00:06:39.710
using a technique called
Laser Wakefield Acceleration.

00:06:39.710 --> 00:06:42.480
So Stuart has a growing
interest in that field,

00:06:42.480 --> 00:06:45.640
in both developing laser
Wakefield accelerators--

00:06:45.640 --> 00:06:48.260
both for particle physics
and for other applications--

00:06:48.260 --> 00:06:50.920
and improving the quality
of the beams from them.

00:06:50.920 --> 00:06:53.400
He's also involved in
a project at DESY lab--

00:06:53.400 --> 00:06:55.940
DESY keeps cropping up, doesn't
it?-- called Flash Forward,

00:06:55.940 --> 00:06:58.940
which will use intense beams
of electrons to drive a plasma

00:06:58.940 --> 00:06:59.680
wave.

00:06:59.680 --> 00:07:02.221
So that's not going to make a
huge amount of sense right now,

00:07:02.221 --> 00:07:05.150
but it will when Stuart gives us
a bit of an introduction later.

00:07:05.150 --> 00:07:06.670
So please, welcome Stuart.

00:07:06.670 --> 00:07:10.116
[APPLAUSE]

00:07:10.616 --> 00:07:12.080
Thank you.

00:07:12.080 --> 00:07:14.070
OK, so that is my
illustrious panel,

00:07:14.070 --> 00:07:17.110
which is why I'm so excited to
dig into some of the science

00:07:17.110 --> 00:07:18.760
behind what they do.

00:07:18.760 --> 00:07:21.690
So what I asked each of my
panel to do is actually,

00:07:21.690 --> 00:07:24.910
basically, provide a five minute
kind of introduction-pitch

00:07:24.910 --> 00:07:27.360
to the types of projects
that they work on

00:07:27.360 --> 00:07:30.050
that they think might
happen in the future.

00:07:30.050 --> 00:07:33.760
So the first contribution
to that is Phil Burrows.

00:07:33.760 --> 00:07:37.591
So hopefully we have
some slides to go along.

00:07:37.591 --> 00:07:38.340
Over to you, Phil.

00:07:38.340 --> 00:07:38.840
OK.

00:07:38.840 --> 00:07:40.130
Thank you very much, Susie.

00:07:40.130 --> 00:07:41.310
Is the microphone working?

00:07:41.310 --> 00:07:42.300
Can everybody hear me?

00:07:42.300 --> 00:07:43.231
OK, super.

00:07:43.231 --> 00:07:45.730
Well, ladies and gentlemen thank
you very much for giving up

00:07:45.730 --> 00:07:49.620
a rather lovely Friday evening
in September to come and join

00:07:49.620 --> 00:07:52.850
is in this conversation
about possible future large

00:07:52.850 --> 00:07:54.350
accelerator projects.

00:07:54.350 --> 00:07:56.270
Now you've already
identified yourselves

00:07:56.270 --> 00:07:59.190
as a very erudite audience
because everybody's heard

00:07:59.190 --> 00:08:01.280
of the Large Hadron Collider.

00:08:01.280 --> 00:08:05.430
And everybody knows that large
modern, high-energy particle

00:08:05.430 --> 00:08:08.560
accelerators are
circular, such as the LHC

00:08:08.560 --> 00:08:10.290
that you see on the
photograph here.

00:08:10.290 --> 00:08:13.700
Well they're circular, that
is, except when they're not.

00:08:13.700 --> 00:08:17.990
And so this is a photograph
of the two-mile long linear

00:08:17.990 --> 00:08:20.140
collider at Stanford
in California.

00:08:20.140 --> 00:08:22.400
And in fact, frank and
I had the privilege

00:08:22.400 --> 00:08:25.460
to work together on this
project in the 1990s.

00:08:25.460 --> 00:08:27.630
And you can see,
manifestly, that it is

00:08:27.630 --> 00:08:30.040
linear-- it is two miles long.

00:08:30.040 --> 00:08:32.610
So what do we do?

00:08:32.610 --> 00:08:35.200
What do we want to do with
linear electron-positron

00:08:35.200 --> 00:08:35.700
colliders?

00:08:35.700 --> 00:08:38.220
Well we want to take
subatomic particles--

00:08:38.220 --> 00:08:40.830
electrons-- we want
to collide them

00:08:40.830 --> 00:08:43.010
with their
anti-matter partners--

00:08:43.010 --> 00:08:46.090
positrons, which have the
opposite electric charge.

00:08:46.090 --> 00:08:49.080
When electrons meet positrons,
matter and anti-matter

00:08:49.080 --> 00:08:52.840
annihilate, energy is
released, and condenses

00:08:52.840 --> 00:08:55.470
out of that energy
are exciting types

00:08:55.470 --> 00:08:58.209
of new elementary particles,
for example, the Higgs bosons,

00:08:58.209 --> 00:09:00.000
which I'm sure most of
you will have heard.

00:09:00.000 --> 00:09:02.940
It was discovered only a
couple of years ago at CERN.

00:09:02.940 --> 00:09:06.740
For example, top quarks,
which are very heavy types

00:09:06.740 --> 00:09:09.030
of subatomic building
blocks of matter.

00:09:09.030 --> 00:09:11.730
And of course, who knows,
maybe dark matter particle,

00:09:11.730 --> 00:09:13.970
supersymmetric
particles, something

00:09:13.970 --> 00:09:17.620
that has yet to be discovered
about which we would be very

00:09:17.620 --> 00:09:19.960
excited and very keen to know.

00:09:19.960 --> 00:09:21.970
So linear
electron-positron colliders

00:09:21.970 --> 00:09:26.530
are the way forward to serve
as factories for mass-producing

00:09:26.530 --> 00:09:29.080
Higgs bosons, top
quarks, and hopefully,

00:09:29.080 --> 00:09:31.260
dark matter and other
types of new particles.

00:09:31.260 --> 00:09:33.850
We're talking about hundreds
of thousands of Higgs bosons,

00:09:33.850 --> 00:09:36.244
hundreds of thousands of
top corks-- samples that

00:09:36.244 --> 00:09:38.160
will allow us to really
measure the properties

00:09:38.160 --> 00:09:40.940
of these particles with
exquisite precision

00:09:40.940 --> 00:09:43.260
and understand what they are.

00:09:43.260 --> 00:09:46.790
Now there are two major projects
which are being proposed

00:09:46.790 --> 00:09:51.235
for implementation for
high-energy future E+, E-

00:09:51.235 --> 00:09:52.970
electron-positron
linear colliders.

00:09:52.970 --> 00:09:55.640
This one is the international
linear collider.

00:09:55.640 --> 00:09:58.450
To cut a long story short,
you stick electrons in at one

00:09:58.450 --> 00:10:00.800
end you, stick positrons
in at the other end,

00:10:00.800 --> 00:10:02.640
you accelerate them
together, and you

00:10:02.640 --> 00:10:05.090
do matter-anti-matter
annihilations in the middle.

00:10:05.090 --> 00:10:07.490
The rest of the detail, you
don't need to worry about.

00:10:07.490 --> 00:10:10.350
The footprint of this machine
is about 30 kilometers.

00:10:10.350 --> 00:10:13.610
Our friends in Japan
have-- the particle

00:10:13.610 --> 00:10:15.950
physics community
in Japan very much

00:10:15.950 --> 00:10:19.230
wants to host this machine in
the northern part of Japan just

00:10:19.230 --> 00:10:20.692
north of the city of Sendai.

00:10:20.692 --> 00:10:23.150
You can see on the map there,
the footprint of the machine.

00:10:23.150 --> 00:10:25.460
If you look closely, you
can see a cross-section

00:10:25.460 --> 00:10:28.500
through the geology of the
mountains in the Kitakami

00:10:28.500 --> 00:10:29.000
region.

00:10:29.000 --> 00:10:31.390
So this project,
we hope very much,

00:10:31.390 --> 00:10:34.790
will be realized in Japan.

00:10:34.790 --> 00:10:37.380
Now another project, which
is perhaps a little bit

00:10:37.380 --> 00:10:41.830
further away, is the
compact linear collider.

00:10:41.830 --> 00:10:44.510
And I, as Susie said,
I'm privileged to be

00:10:44.510 --> 00:10:46.880
the spokesman-- or if
you like, Principal

00:10:46.880 --> 00:10:49.570
Investigator-- of this project.

00:10:49.570 --> 00:10:51.444
Again, don't worry
about the details.

00:10:51.444 --> 00:10:53.860
It's a slightly bigger version
of the international linear

00:10:53.860 --> 00:10:54.359
collider.

00:10:54.359 --> 00:10:56.980
It's designed to get to
somewhat higher energies

00:10:56.980 --> 00:10:58.320
of these collisions.

00:10:58.320 --> 00:11:01.050
And never let it be said that
accelerator physicists don't

00:11:01.050 --> 00:11:03.620
have a sense of humor
because compact means

00:11:03.620 --> 00:11:05.630
50 kilometers long.

00:11:05.630 --> 00:11:07.290
But that's a jolly
sight more compact

00:11:07.290 --> 00:11:08.940
than it would be
if it weren't made

00:11:08.940 --> 00:11:11.020
with this wonderful technology.

00:11:11.020 --> 00:11:13.690
As Susie mentioned, I think it's
important to note that these

00:11:13.690 --> 00:11:15.010
are global scale projects.

00:11:15.010 --> 00:11:17.770
So in the case of the
Compact Linear Collider,

00:11:17.770 --> 00:11:20.260
300 people, 50
institutes, 31 countries.

00:11:20.260 --> 00:11:22.690
So my joke, at this
point, is the sun never

00:11:22.690 --> 00:11:24.960
sets on my empire.

00:11:24.960 --> 00:11:27.210
Now if that project
were realized,

00:11:27.210 --> 00:11:29.530
it would be realized in
the Geneva region at CERN.

00:11:29.530 --> 00:11:30.750
So here you see a little map.

00:11:30.750 --> 00:11:32.291
The little white
circle in the middle

00:11:32.291 --> 00:11:33.990
is the Large Hadron Collider.

00:11:33.990 --> 00:11:35.820
And then you can
see magenta, green,

00:11:35.820 --> 00:11:38.690
and blue linear arrays of dots.

00:11:38.690 --> 00:11:40.610
And those represent
the different stages

00:11:40.610 --> 00:11:42.780
of this project,
leading eventually

00:11:42.780 --> 00:11:46.490
to an energy of 3,000
giga-electron volts--

00:11:46.490 --> 00:11:49.890
or accelerating
particles-- to energies

00:11:49.890 --> 00:11:54.500
of 1.5 trillion volts
for the electrons,

00:11:54.500 --> 00:11:56.530
and 1.5 trillion volts
for the positrons.

00:11:56.530 --> 00:11:59.350
So these are very
high energy machines.

00:11:59.350 --> 00:12:02.380
So what I would hope
to argue this evening

00:12:02.380 --> 00:12:04.200
is that the way ahead is linear.

00:12:04.200 --> 00:12:05.800
Linear colliders
allow collisions

00:12:05.800 --> 00:12:08.570
of point-like particles
under controlled conditions.

00:12:08.570 --> 00:12:10.300
They allow
factory-level production

00:12:10.300 --> 00:12:12.940
of things such as Higgs
bosons, which we really

00:12:12.940 --> 00:12:14.690
need to understand
having just discovered

00:12:14.690 --> 00:12:16.710
them a few years ago.

00:12:16.710 --> 00:12:18.050
Why linear?

00:12:18.050 --> 00:12:20.360
Well, the problem--
and Frank, of course,

00:12:20.360 --> 00:12:23.110
will talk about this
in his presentation--

00:12:23.110 --> 00:12:26.160
when you try to accelerate
electrons or positrons

00:12:26.160 --> 00:12:28.680
in a circle, they emit x-rays.

00:12:28.680 --> 00:12:30.150
This is call
synchrotron radiation.

00:12:30.150 --> 00:12:31.760
And at some point,
as fast as you

00:12:31.760 --> 00:12:35.210
are trying to accelerate them,
they're radiating energy away.

00:12:35.210 --> 00:12:36.650
And so it's generally
agreed that,

00:12:36.650 --> 00:12:38.540
to get to the very
highest energies,

00:12:38.540 --> 00:12:41.100
one should avoid this
synchrotron radiation.

00:12:41.100 --> 00:12:44.630
And therefore, the
future is linear machines

00:12:44.630 --> 00:12:46.290
with no synchrotron radiation.

00:12:46.290 --> 00:12:48.920
They're elegantly expandable
because you can always

00:12:48.920 --> 00:12:50.520
make them that bit longer.

00:12:50.520 --> 00:12:52.700
and therefore get
to higher energies.

00:12:52.700 --> 00:12:54.920
And they are
intrinsically upgradable

00:12:54.920 --> 00:12:58.640
because, once you have your
nice 30-kilometer-long tunnel,

00:12:58.640 --> 00:13:02.250
when Stuart comes along in 50
years when his technology is

00:13:02.250 --> 00:13:06.900
working, you can always stick
it into this beautiful tunnel

00:13:06.900 --> 00:13:08.370
and you can get
to higher energies

00:13:08.370 --> 00:13:12.300
by upgrading the facility that
you have as technology comes

00:13:12.300 --> 00:13:15.050
along and as you're able to get
to higher and higher energies--

00:13:15.050 --> 00:13:18.380
so elegantly expandable and
intrinsically upgradable.

00:13:18.380 --> 00:13:20.130
And the technologies
that we're developing

00:13:20.130 --> 00:13:22.360
with many applications--
this is my last couple

00:13:22.360 --> 00:13:24.440
of slides, Susie,
as you know-- this

00:13:24.440 --> 00:13:27.110
is the European x-ray-free
electron laser at the DESY

00:13:27.110 --> 00:13:29.206
laboratorY-- again, in Hamburg.

00:13:29.206 --> 00:13:31.580
And the technology that we've
developed-- superconducting

00:13:31.580 --> 00:13:33.875
niobium radio-frequency
accelerating cavity

00:13:33.875 --> 00:13:37.230
is the shiny thing,
bottom left, there.

00:13:37.230 --> 00:13:40.590
This technology developed for
these big high-energy machines,

00:13:40.590 --> 00:13:42.520
such as the International
linear collider,

00:13:42.520 --> 00:13:44.650
has now been deployed in
the two-kilometer machine

00:13:44.650 --> 00:13:45.160
in Hamburg.

00:13:45.160 --> 00:13:49.970
It's a 10% scale model
of the real machine.

00:13:49.970 --> 00:13:52.230
And this will serve tens
of thousands of scientists

00:13:52.230 --> 00:13:55.080
by producing x-rays to look
at the structure of matter,

00:13:55.080 --> 00:13:57.210
materials through
structural biology,

00:13:57.210 --> 00:13:59.370
do biomedicine,
chemistry, and so on.

00:13:59.370 --> 00:14:00.870
So this is an example
of the spinoff

00:14:00.870 --> 00:14:03.870
of the technology for the
great benefit of wider science.

00:14:03.870 --> 00:14:05.990
And I love this slide.

00:14:05.990 --> 00:14:07.820
This is another example
of the application

00:14:07.820 --> 00:14:09.990
of linear accelerating
technology.

00:14:09.990 --> 00:14:11.420
The gentlemen, in
the bottom left,

00:14:11.420 --> 00:14:14.220
are carrying a
roughly 1-meter-long

00:14:14.220 --> 00:14:16.860
accelerating structure
made of copper.

00:14:16.860 --> 00:14:18.729
They've developed
structures like that

00:14:18.729 --> 00:14:20.770
for the purpose of getting
to the high energies--

00:14:20.770 --> 00:14:23.170
the big, two-mile long machine
at Stanford that you see

00:14:23.170 --> 00:14:25.790
upstairs-- and
today, there is one

00:14:25.790 --> 00:14:30.820
of those structures in more
than 10,000 x-ray therapy

00:14:30.820 --> 00:14:32.950
machines that have been
deployed in hospitals

00:14:32.950 --> 00:14:33.810
all over the world.

00:14:33.810 --> 00:14:36.480
There are more than 10,000
of these machines worldwide.

00:14:36.480 --> 00:14:39.970
And in the UK alone,
10,000 people, per day,

00:14:39.970 --> 00:14:42.760
are treated with cancer
therapy from machines

00:14:42.760 --> 00:14:45.020
like this which are
employing technology

00:14:45.020 --> 00:14:48.840
developed with a view to very
high-energy linear colliders.

00:14:48.840 --> 00:14:50.950
So I think at that
point, I'd better stop.

00:14:50.950 --> 00:14:52.450
And I'll give my
colleagues a chance

00:14:52.450 --> 00:14:54.815
to get their 10 cents worth.

00:14:54.815 --> 00:14:55.315
Wow.

00:14:55.315 --> 00:14:55.900
Right.

00:14:55.900 --> 00:14:57.836
What a sales pitch. (LAUGHING)

00:14:57.836 --> 00:15:01.590
[APPLAUSE]

00:15:03.060 --> 00:15:03.560
OK.

00:15:03.560 --> 00:15:08.290
So having heard the sales
pitch for linear colliders,

00:15:08.290 --> 00:15:10.790
as I said in my introduction,
at the moment there's

00:15:10.790 --> 00:15:14.810
a large study at CERN happening
for a circular collider

00:15:14.810 --> 00:15:15.310
instead.

00:15:15.310 --> 00:15:17.185
So Frank, over to you.

00:15:17.185 --> 00:15:17.685
OK.

00:15:17.685 --> 00:15:19.390
Thank you.

00:15:19.390 --> 00:15:21.390
Of course, I disagree
with the statement of Phil

00:15:21.390 --> 00:15:24.036
that the future is linear.

00:15:24.036 --> 00:15:25.160
Maybe, can I stand up here?

00:15:25.160 --> 00:15:26.743
I have some problem
with the eyesight.

00:15:26.743 --> 00:15:29.950
It's difficult for me
to see on the screen.

00:15:29.950 --> 00:15:33.950
OK, here is the history of
colliders-- electron-positron

00:15:33.950 --> 00:15:39.440
colliders in blue and center
of mass and Hadron Colliders--

00:15:39.440 --> 00:15:41.030
proton colliders in red.

00:15:41.030 --> 00:15:45.110
And this is a logarithmic scale
of the center of mass energy.

00:15:45.110 --> 00:15:49.170
Over the last 50 or 60 years,
you can see dramatic progress

00:15:49.170 --> 00:15:50.310
in the collision energy.

00:15:50.310 --> 00:15:53.450
So we got
[? effect our source ?]

00:15:53.450 --> 00:15:56.240
in the energy of
electron-positron collisions

00:15:56.240 --> 00:15:59.115
and the factor of a hundred
in the energy of Hadron

00:15:59.115 --> 00:16:00.817
Colliders-- slightly above 100.

00:16:00.817 --> 00:16:02.650
And there were not so
many-- as you can see,

00:16:02.650 --> 00:16:04.310
there were not so
many Hadron Colliders

00:16:04.310 --> 00:16:08.250
and there used to be more
electron-positron colliders.

00:16:08.250 --> 00:16:11.230
And these colliders seem
successful because they allowed

00:16:11.230 --> 00:16:13.620
us to construct a so-called
standard model of particle

00:16:13.620 --> 00:16:14.580
physics.

00:16:14.580 --> 00:16:17.260
In the standard model,
we have meta-particles,

00:16:17.260 --> 00:16:19.170
which consists of
quarks and leptons

00:16:19.170 --> 00:16:23.940
and we have force carriers
which are these bosons here.

00:16:23.940 --> 00:16:27.320
And then there is a different
particles, the six boson, which

00:16:27.320 --> 00:16:29.229
is neither matter nore force.

00:16:29.229 --> 00:16:31.020
It is completely
different from the others.

00:16:31.020 --> 00:16:33.620
So many of these-- all
the heavier particles here

00:16:33.620 --> 00:16:36.270
they discovered as
colliders. [INAUDIBLE]

00:16:36.270 --> 00:16:39.730
discovered the quark,
and to Tau lepton,

00:16:39.730 --> 00:16:41.292
Petra discovered the gruong.

00:16:41.292 --> 00:16:42.500
That was in Europe-- at DESY.

00:16:42.500 --> 00:16:44.110
That was the only
such discovery which

00:16:44.110 --> 00:16:48.220
didn't give a Nobel
Prize for some reason.

00:16:48.220 --> 00:16:53.340
Then the SPP at CERN
discovered the NW Boson.

00:16:53.340 --> 00:16:55.310
Tevatron discovered
the top quark.

00:16:55.310 --> 00:16:56.790
And then the LHC,
as you may know,

00:16:56.790 --> 00:17:00.485
a few years ago, discovered this
new particle, the Higgs boson.

00:17:00.485 --> 00:17:03.030
So the colliders
were essentially

00:17:03.030 --> 00:17:05.990
in unraveling this
part-- the heavier

00:17:05.990 --> 00:17:07.700
part of the standard model.

00:17:07.700 --> 00:17:10.460
And they have proven a powerful
instrument for discovery

00:17:10.460 --> 00:17:14.170
and for precision measurement.

00:17:14.170 --> 00:17:17.270
OK-- we have the standard
model, but many questions

00:17:17.270 --> 00:17:18.940
are not explained by
the standard model.

00:17:18.940 --> 00:17:20.230
Here's an incomplete list.

00:17:20.230 --> 00:17:22.579
So the standard model only
describes the known matter--

00:17:22.579 --> 00:17:25.699
the visible matter, which
is about 5% of the universe.

00:17:25.699 --> 00:17:27.240
There's a large
part, which is called

00:17:27.240 --> 00:17:29.650
dark matter, which is visible
in the rotational speed

00:17:29.650 --> 00:17:30.410
of the galaxies.

00:17:30.410 --> 00:17:34.430
If you believe in
Newton and Einstein,

00:17:34.430 --> 00:17:36.440
then you need additional
matter to explain

00:17:36.440 --> 00:17:39.750
the observed rotational
velocity seen in the universe.

00:17:39.750 --> 00:17:42.430
And then in addition, there is
something called dark energy.

00:17:42.430 --> 00:17:45.870
I think that maybe later we
can explain the dark energy.

00:17:45.870 --> 00:17:49.890
That comprises even larger--
this comprises even larger part

00:17:49.890 --> 00:17:51.770
of the unknown.

00:17:51.770 --> 00:17:56.702
So maybe 3/4 of the energy of
the universe is dark energy

00:17:56.702 --> 00:17:57.910
and we don't know what it is.

00:17:57.910 --> 00:17:58.900
And then we have more matter.

00:17:58.900 --> 00:17:59.733
We have only matter.

00:17:59.733 --> 00:18:01.130
We have no
anti-matter-- planets,

00:18:01.130 --> 00:18:04.750
anti-matter-- why do we have
matter and not anti-matter?

00:18:04.750 --> 00:18:07.350
And why do the masses of
these fundamental particles

00:18:07.350 --> 00:18:10.820
differ by certain
orders of magnitude.

00:18:10.820 --> 00:18:13.690
Anyway, gravity is not really
included in the standard model.

00:18:13.690 --> 00:18:17.710
And it's very difficult to
combine it with quantum physics

00:18:17.710 --> 00:18:19.010
and with the forces.

00:18:19.010 --> 00:18:22.590
And then there's a search
for word equation, which

00:18:22.590 --> 00:18:26.320
has so not been accomplished.

00:18:26.320 --> 00:18:28.760
Although I think
that some people

00:18:28.760 --> 00:18:32.850
tried to develop it
100 years ago already.

00:18:32.850 --> 00:18:37.310
OK so we are back on the future
of the circular collider.

00:18:37.310 --> 00:18:40.340
In response to the upgrade of
the so-called European strategy

00:18:40.340 --> 00:18:42.610
for particle physics,
in 2013, they

00:18:42.610 --> 00:18:47.540
requested a study of a
post-LHC collider complex

00:18:47.540 --> 00:18:50.810
after the Large Hadron
Collider, based at CERN.

00:18:50.810 --> 00:18:53.420
And this would be a
larger circular ring.

00:18:53.420 --> 00:18:55.700
Here you see, the LHC
looks small, as unfiltered,

00:18:55.700 --> 00:18:57.900
but here we don't talk
about a long line.

00:18:57.900 --> 00:18:59.520
But we have another
circle, which

00:18:59.520 --> 00:19:01.440
is now 100 kilometers
in circumference, which

00:19:01.440 --> 00:19:03.520
would go around
the city of Geneva

00:19:03.520 --> 00:19:05.980
and the nearby mountain,
which is called the Saleve.

00:19:05.980 --> 00:19:08.912
And it would pass under
the lake of Geneva.

00:19:08.912 --> 00:19:09.870
We are quite fortunate.

00:19:09.870 --> 00:19:11.930
On this side-- on
the Geneva side,

00:19:11.930 --> 00:19:14.650
the lake is rather shallow,
only 15 meters deep.

00:19:14.650 --> 00:19:17.020
But on the other side, it
becomes very, very deep

00:19:17.020 --> 00:19:19.990
on the opposite side
at [? Montre ?].

00:19:19.990 --> 00:19:21.310
So there's no problem.

00:19:21.310 --> 00:19:23.660
The LHC is 100 meters
under the surface

00:19:23.660 --> 00:19:26.730
and this FCC will be 200
meters under the surface.

00:19:26.730 --> 00:19:29.230
So there's no issue
going under the lake.

00:19:29.230 --> 00:19:30.210
But we are limited.

00:19:30.210 --> 00:19:32.190
We cannot build something much
bigger than 100 kilometers

00:19:32.190 --> 00:19:34.250
because on the one side,
there are the Arabs here

00:19:34.250 --> 00:19:36.030
and on the other,
the Jura Mountain.

00:19:36.030 --> 00:19:39.780
And we don't 1000-meter-deep
access shafts.

00:19:39.780 --> 00:19:42.891
So we are somewhat limited
to this 100 kilometers.

00:19:42.891 --> 00:19:45.390
Now we would like to go up, in
energy, an order of magnitude

00:19:45.390 --> 00:19:46.500
beyond the LHC.

00:19:46.500 --> 00:19:49.490
There are reasons to believe
that going up in a factor

00:19:49.490 --> 00:19:55.250
10 or so in energy will
help us understand the Higgs

00:19:55.250 --> 00:19:56.960
mechanism-- more
properties of the Higgs

00:19:56.960 --> 00:19:58.860
particle, the
potential of the Higgs,

00:19:58.860 --> 00:20:02.250
and also perhaps help us
understand dark matter,

00:20:02.250 --> 00:20:03.810
and with luck dark energy.

00:20:03.810 --> 00:20:06.490
So to go to 100 TeV
in this larger ring,

00:20:06.490 --> 00:20:09.760
we need 16 Tesla
magnets-- dipole magnets.

00:20:09.760 --> 00:20:12.230
And the LHC has eight
tesla and that was already

00:20:12.230 --> 00:20:14.730
extremely difficult. And if
you want to go from eight tesla

00:20:14.730 --> 00:20:16.810
to 16 tesla, you need
a new technology.

00:20:16.810 --> 00:20:19.070
So we need a new type
of superconductor

00:20:19.070 --> 00:20:20.770
to make these magnets.

00:20:20.770 --> 00:20:23.350
Those are simple equations.

00:20:23.350 --> 00:20:25.490
Actually, energy of a Hadron
Collider is very easy.

00:20:25.490 --> 00:20:27.240
It's just proportional
to the magnetic field

00:20:27.240 --> 00:20:28.170
and the circumference.

00:20:28.170 --> 00:20:29.436
So we are increasing both.

00:20:29.436 --> 00:20:30.810
So we're increasing
circumference

00:20:30.810 --> 00:20:33.650
by a factor 4 almost, and we're
increasing the magnetic field

00:20:33.650 --> 00:20:36.230
by factor 2, which is
already quite challenging.

00:20:36.230 --> 00:20:40.380
And together, we get almost
a factor 8 in energy.

00:20:40.380 --> 00:20:42.110
If we builds this new
tunnel, we can also

00:20:42.110 --> 00:20:44.310
think about putting other
colliders in the standard.

00:20:44.310 --> 00:20:47.660
For example, we can put a
compositron circular collider.

00:20:47.660 --> 00:20:50.637
And that would have a
very excellent performance

00:20:50.637 --> 00:20:52.720
at energies where we can
produce a Higgs particle.

00:20:52.720 --> 00:20:54.680
So this would also be
a very beautiful Higgs

00:20:54.680 --> 00:20:57.450
factory and also a nice
factory of top quark.

00:20:57.450 --> 00:21:00.590
So we can actually produce
all the known particles,

00:21:00.590 --> 00:21:03.450
and in very large
quantities, and measure

00:21:03.450 --> 00:21:05.937
with extreme precision
to see any deviation

00:21:05.937 --> 00:21:07.770
from the standard model,
which would give us

00:21:07.770 --> 00:21:10.626
a hint at which the next energy
scale in [? new ?] physics

00:21:10.626 --> 00:21:11.780
should appear.

00:21:11.780 --> 00:21:14.510
Of course, we can also collide
electrons with protons,

00:21:14.510 --> 00:21:17.230
as we did at HERA in
Hamburg, where I started.

00:21:17.230 --> 00:21:19.470
So people who want to make
a super-HERA with it's

00:21:19.470 --> 00:21:22.650
10-times higher energy and 10
to 100-times the luminosity.

00:21:22.650 --> 00:21:24.680
So this could also be possible.

00:21:24.680 --> 00:21:27.100
And in addition, we have
a less ambitious study.

00:21:27.100 --> 00:21:28.670
We developed the
16 tesla magnets,

00:21:28.670 --> 00:21:30.240
we could install
these magnets also

00:21:30.240 --> 00:21:32.670
in the existing LHC tunnel.

00:21:32.670 --> 00:21:34.510
And that would allow
us to double the energy

00:21:34.510 --> 00:21:36.850
of the Large Hadron Collder.

00:21:36.850 --> 00:21:39.330
This is a time scale of the
large circular colliders

00:21:39.330 --> 00:21:39.831
at CERN.

00:21:39.831 --> 00:21:42.080
There was LEP that was an
electron positron collider--

00:21:42.080 --> 00:21:46.040
study's design started
in the mid-1970s.

00:21:46.040 --> 00:21:50.340
And you see, it took
more than 10 years

00:21:50.340 --> 00:21:52.030
to design and
construct it and then

00:21:52.030 --> 00:21:53.930
it operated twelve
years for physics.

00:21:53.930 --> 00:21:55.440
And there's the LHC.

00:21:55.440 --> 00:21:58.130
And this will be followed by a
high-luminosity upgrades, which

00:21:58.130 --> 00:22:02.180
is an extension of the
LHC to give 10-times

00:22:02.180 --> 00:22:04.670
the performance, which is
called the high-luminosity LHC.

00:22:04.670 --> 00:22:07.130
And so the LHC and
[INAUDIBLE] together

00:22:07.130 --> 00:22:14.070
will run for about 25, 27
years, from 2010 to about 2037.

00:22:14.070 --> 00:22:15.870
So we have about
20 years time now

00:22:15.870 --> 00:22:19.560
to develop a concept
for a future colliders.

00:22:19.560 --> 00:22:23.670
So we have started this
future circular collider

00:22:23.670 --> 00:22:27.000
design, which is four different
colliders in one study.

00:22:27.000 --> 00:22:29.770
And we aim prototyping phase.

00:22:29.770 --> 00:22:32.440
If it is supported by the next
update of the [INAUDIBLE] study

00:22:32.440 --> 00:22:35.150
in 2019, we could go
into a prototyping

00:22:35.150 --> 00:22:36.190
phase at construction.

00:22:36.190 --> 00:22:38.660
And ideally, we would
like to start the physics

00:22:38.660 --> 00:22:42.630
at this new machine when the
LHC physics terminates, so

00:22:42.630 --> 00:22:45.530
in the second half of the 2030s.

00:22:45.530 --> 00:22:47.179
So we must advance
fast now because we

00:22:47.179 --> 00:22:49.720
have less time available than
had been available for the LHC.

00:22:49.720 --> 00:22:51.630
And this machine is
much bigger and it's

00:22:51.630 --> 00:22:53.810
even more advanced technology.

00:22:53.810 --> 00:22:55.380
So we don't have so much time.

00:22:55.380 --> 00:22:58.980
And our intermediate goal is to
have a solid conceptual design

00:22:58.980 --> 00:23:00.890
by the end of 2018.

00:23:00.890 --> 00:23:03.230
So we are about halfway
in this process.

00:23:03.230 --> 00:23:08.450
And we are looking at
all the items, including

00:23:08.450 --> 00:23:13.960
the construction schedule, the
cost, the key technologies,

00:23:13.960 --> 00:23:18.010
and parameter space
for operation.

00:23:18.010 --> 00:23:20.380
And the one goal is
that we absolutely

00:23:20.380 --> 00:23:23.100
must ensure that the promised
performance can be achieved.

00:23:23.100 --> 00:23:24.820
It has been the case
for LEP and LHC--

00:23:24.820 --> 00:23:28.030
both machines reached
the designed performance

00:23:28.030 --> 00:23:29.800
in a rather short time.

00:23:29.800 --> 00:23:33.660
And so in principle, we know
that for this type of machine,

00:23:33.660 --> 00:23:36.400
we should be able to reach
the promised performance.

00:23:36.400 --> 00:23:39.390
But the design study will ensure
that there is enough margin

00:23:39.390 --> 00:23:41.050
to accomplish this.

00:23:41.050 --> 00:23:43.730
OK here is just a picture
on the magnet technologies.

00:23:43.730 --> 00:23:45.866
For a long time, the
US-- United States--

00:23:45.866 --> 00:23:47.740
was leading the high-field
magnet development

00:23:47.740 --> 00:23:50.360
in Berkeley, already,
in the early 2000s.

00:23:50.360 --> 00:23:53.780
They reached a 16 Tesla
field with this magnet, here.

00:23:53.780 --> 00:23:58.880
And last year, at CERN, we
built a similar magnet, which

00:23:58.880 --> 00:24:00.740
also reached a 16 tesla field.

00:24:00.740 --> 00:24:02.900
So in principle, we have
a demonstration that

00:24:02.900 --> 00:24:05.880
was using the [INAUDIBLE]
superconductor,

00:24:05.880 --> 00:24:08.650
we can achieve a 16 tesla
field, which is twice

00:24:08.650 --> 00:24:10.490
the field of the
LHC magnets, which

00:24:10.490 --> 00:24:13.231
are based on [? the ?]
titanium superconductor.

00:24:13.231 --> 00:24:14.230
But we need some margin.

00:24:14.230 --> 00:24:16.520
So we're not quite--
these test magnets

00:24:16.520 --> 00:24:17.890
have no aperture for the beam.

00:24:17.890 --> 00:24:21.470
So we need to have a beam
pipe inside the magnet

00:24:21.470 --> 00:24:24.500
to bend our particles and to
bring them through this magnet.

00:24:24.500 --> 00:24:28.120
So we still need
some development

00:24:28.120 --> 00:24:31.707
to have accelerator-quality
magnets at the 16 tesla field.

00:24:31.707 --> 00:24:33.540
And also, we'd like to
make these magnets as

00:24:33.540 --> 00:24:37.180
cheap as possible so as
[? to add to the ?] effort

00:24:37.180 --> 00:24:39.699
to reduce the cost
of the superconductor

00:24:39.699 --> 00:24:40.490
and of the magnets.

00:24:40.490 --> 00:24:42.540
You're at about minus a minute.

00:24:42.540 --> 00:24:44.853
Minus a minute-- my last
slide-- this shows you there,

00:24:44.853 --> 00:24:48.440
Hadron Colliders unraveling
the secrets of the universe.

00:24:48.440 --> 00:24:51.070
So there used to be the
Tevatron in the Chicago,

00:24:51.070 --> 00:24:53.300
at the so-called fermilab.

00:24:53.300 --> 00:24:59.110
It was from 1983 to 2011 at
2 TeV center of mass energy.

00:24:59.110 --> 00:25:02.590
Then now we have the LHC,
factor 7 high energy.

00:25:02.590 --> 00:25:04.680
Both were important discoveries.

00:25:04.680 --> 00:25:07.410
And then we are planning
to make the next step.

00:25:07.410 --> 00:25:09.750
And also I would love
the future to be linear

00:25:09.750 --> 00:25:11.760
if you wanted to use
this linear collider

00:25:11.760 --> 00:25:13.740
technology to build
a 100 TeV collider,

00:25:13.740 --> 00:25:15.610
we would need 3,000 kilometer.

00:25:15.610 --> 00:25:19.340
And with this technology, we are
staying below 100 kilometers.

00:25:19.340 --> 00:25:21.330
So there is still
a [? juggle. ?]

00:25:21.330 --> 00:25:24.680
We think that circular
colliders are still

00:25:24.680 --> 00:25:27.990
the way for if you want to
see 100 TV in this century.

00:25:27.990 --> 00:25:28.550
OK.

00:25:28.550 --> 00:25:29.049
Thank you.

00:25:29.049 --> 00:25:29.790
Thank you, Frank.

00:25:29.790 --> 00:25:30.290
Thank you.

00:25:32.900 --> 00:25:34.802
Alright.

00:25:34.802 --> 00:25:37.010
So we can start to see a
little bit of a conversation

00:25:37.010 --> 00:25:39.100
may be developing
between linear colliders

00:25:39.100 --> 00:25:41.430
and circular colliders.

00:25:41.430 --> 00:25:44.516
So a few key points there,
that we'll come back

00:25:44.516 --> 00:25:46.140
to in a bit was,
first of all, the time

00:25:46.140 --> 00:25:49.050
scale of some of these projects,
which I'll come back to.

00:25:49.050 --> 00:25:53.640
Second of all, the
electron-positron machines

00:25:53.640 --> 00:25:58.550
in Phil's linear
collider version--

00:25:58.550 --> 00:26:01.140
sort of three kilometers
long, maybe-- no sorry,

00:26:01.140 --> 00:26:03.850
30 kilometers long,
50 kilometers long.

00:26:03.850 --> 00:26:07.160
But to actually do the same
thing for Hadron's would

00:26:07.160 --> 00:26:09.580
be, say, 3,000 kilometers long?

00:26:09.580 --> 00:26:11.400
That's your estimate,
approximately?

00:26:11.400 --> 00:26:14.789
OK so it was saying that there's
some different physics involved

00:26:14.789 --> 00:26:16.580
there and how difficult
it is to accelerate

00:26:16.580 --> 00:26:18.540
those particles and
the energies you need

00:26:18.540 --> 00:26:20.880
to reach the physics
that you're looking for,

00:26:20.880 --> 00:26:22.530
which we'll come
back to in a bit.

00:26:22.530 --> 00:26:26.660
So the two other speakers
here have slightly different

00:26:26.660 --> 00:26:28.870
viewpoints, I think.

00:26:28.870 --> 00:26:30.800
And one of the topics
that Phil covered

00:26:30.800 --> 00:26:32.240
was synchrotron radiation.

00:26:32.240 --> 00:26:35.390
And that's a really important
topic in building accelerators

00:26:35.390 --> 00:26:37.900
because if you bend a
particle around a corner,

00:26:37.900 --> 00:26:39.687
it loses energy.

00:26:39.687 --> 00:26:41.270
So at some point,
you're just fighting

00:26:41.270 --> 00:26:43.360
to put that energy back in.

00:26:43.360 --> 00:26:45.470
And Ken, I think
some of the machines

00:26:45.470 --> 00:26:48.330
you talk about have a different
approach to tackling that.

00:26:48.330 --> 00:26:49.599
So--

00:26:49.599 --> 00:26:50.140
That's right.

00:26:50.140 --> 00:26:50.681
Here you are.

00:26:50.681 --> 00:26:51.540
Hand it off to Ken.

00:26:51.540 --> 00:26:52.040
Yeah.

00:26:52.040 --> 00:26:54.810
So I think actually,
what's exciting is actually

00:26:54.810 --> 00:26:56.891
the breadth of science
that can be addressed

00:26:56.891 --> 00:26:58.140
by these different techniques.

00:26:58.140 --> 00:26:59.780
So what I'm supposed
to talk about

00:26:59.780 --> 00:27:03.540
is a different kind
of particle that you

00:27:03.540 --> 00:27:04.990
could use to do the science.

00:27:04.990 --> 00:27:09.940
And so the jargon title is a
neutrino factory muon collider.

00:27:09.940 --> 00:27:11.565
The key thing is they
accelerate muons.

00:27:11.565 --> 00:27:13.930
And I hope it will
become obvious why.

00:27:13.930 --> 00:27:16.860
So here is the particle
content of the standard model.

00:27:16.860 --> 00:27:19.130
You've seen that already.

00:27:19.130 --> 00:27:23.840
You've got quarks that make
up what we call the Hadrons.

00:27:23.840 --> 00:27:26.230
If you have up and down,
you can make protons.

00:27:26.230 --> 00:27:27.200
You have electrons.

00:27:27.200 --> 00:27:29.480
That now means you
can make atoms.

00:27:29.480 --> 00:27:32.300
And that's basically all
you need for real life.

00:27:32.300 --> 00:27:34.100
There are two more families.

00:27:34.100 --> 00:27:38.150
And they're there as you go
to the left on that plot.

00:27:38.150 --> 00:27:40.190
And you've got a whole
line of particles,

00:27:40.190 --> 00:27:41.640
which are called the neutrinos.

00:27:41.640 --> 00:27:43.680
So when I did the
particle physics course

00:27:43.680 --> 00:27:46.224
at Imperial College in
'98, they were massless.

00:27:46.224 --> 00:27:48.890
And then there was the discovery
of neutrino oscillations, which

00:27:48.890 --> 00:27:50.810
means they are not massless.

00:27:50.810 --> 00:27:51.870
They have some mass.

00:27:51.870 --> 00:27:54.610
That means they do not
go the speed of light.

00:27:54.610 --> 00:27:56.520
They have no conserved
quantum numbers.

00:27:56.520 --> 00:27:57.810
That's important.

00:27:57.810 --> 00:28:00.420
That means that a
neutrino can change

00:28:00.420 --> 00:28:02.670
from being the partner
of the electron to being

00:28:02.670 --> 00:28:05.300
the partner of the muon as it
travels through space and time.

00:28:05.300 --> 00:28:08.300
So it's really like a
traveling Schrodinger's Cat.

00:28:08.300 --> 00:28:11.720
One minute, it's alive and
the next minute it's dead.

00:28:11.720 --> 00:28:14.400
And the good thing is
that the weak interaction

00:28:14.400 --> 00:28:17.180
has got the opening
the box thing,

00:28:17.180 --> 00:28:20.020
because the weak interaction
picks out the flavor.

00:28:20.020 --> 00:28:21.000
And you can tell.

00:28:21.000 --> 00:28:23.880
So that's how we know
they've got mass.

00:28:23.880 --> 00:28:27.260
OK so I'm going to talk a
little bit about the neutrinos.

00:28:27.260 --> 00:28:32.340
What we do, technically,
is we take the neutrinos.

00:28:32.340 --> 00:28:34.210
We invent three mass
eigenstates for them,

00:28:34.210 --> 00:28:35.820
so there are three
types of neutrino

00:28:35.820 --> 00:28:37.930
that are distinguished
by their mass.

00:28:37.930 --> 00:28:38.830
We mix them up.

00:28:38.830 --> 00:28:40.340
And that's how we
get the flavors.

00:28:40.340 --> 00:28:44.930
And we want to measure the
way in which that happens.

00:28:44.930 --> 00:28:47.650
So-- can you see that
on the bigger screen?

00:28:47.650 --> 00:28:48.980
I can't see this.

00:28:48.980 --> 00:28:51.460
So here's the cosmic abundance
of different particle types.

00:28:51.460 --> 00:28:53.680
And you will notice that
neutrinos are second only

00:28:53.680 --> 00:28:54.915
to the number of protons.

00:28:54.915 --> 00:28:56.040
I think it's missing some--

00:28:56.040 --> 00:28:58.250
No, it's on the right-hand
side of the screen,

00:28:58.250 --> 00:28:59.580
I hope, in that figure.

00:28:59.580 --> 00:29:02.820
The other thing you want to know
is that the mass of neutrinos

00:29:02.820 --> 00:29:05.360
is way different from
everybody else-- several orders

00:29:05.360 --> 00:29:07.080
of magnitude different.

00:29:07.080 --> 00:29:09.460
So we found Higgs fantastic.

00:29:09.460 --> 00:29:11.310
All the charged
particles, we think,

00:29:11.310 --> 00:29:13.260
get their mass from the Higgs.

00:29:13.260 --> 00:29:15.210
Neutrinos are several
orders of magnitude

00:29:15.210 --> 00:29:17.950
lower-- same mechanism?

00:29:17.950 --> 00:29:18.830
Different mechanism?

00:29:18.830 --> 00:29:20.400
We need to find out.

00:29:20.400 --> 00:29:21.800
OK.

00:29:21.800 --> 00:29:24.170
Here's the history of the
universe starting from the Big

00:29:24.170 --> 00:29:24.710
Bang.

00:29:24.710 --> 00:29:26.090
In one slide?

00:29:26.090 --> 00:29:29.220
In one slide, yeah.

00:29:29.220 --> 00:29:31.780
So the important thing
is that neutrinos really

00:29:31.780 --> 00:29:33.830
have some impact here.

00:29:33.830 --> 00:29:39.330
So the impact of neutrinos-- so
if we start at the recent past,

00:29:39.330 --> 00:29:42.860
we know that the
universe is expanding

00:29:42.860 --> 00:29:45.400
and we know there is dark
matter in the universe,

00:29:45.400 --> 00:29:46.500
as was already explained.

00:29:46.500 --> 00:29:48.110
We know there is dark energy.

00:29:48.110 --> 00:29:49.660
So the neutrinos
are rather special.

00:29:49.660 --> 00:29:51.110
They don't have conserved
quantum numbers,

00:29:51.110 --> 00:29:53.360
they've got mass, we don't
know how they got the mass.

00:29:53.360 --> 00:29:55.182
And those theories,
in principle,

00:29:55.182 --> 00:29:56.390
offer explanations for those.

00:29:56.390 --> 00:29:59.070
We need to understand
the neutrinos.

00:29:59.070 --> 00:30:01.850
Neutrinos are almost massless.

00:30:01.850 --> 00:30:02.890
They're not massless.

00:30:02.890 --> 00:30:05.050
So they go almost at
the speed of light.

00:30:05.050 --> 00:30:06.360
They only interact weakly.

00:30:06.360 --> 00:30:08.720
So they can communicate
over vast distances

00:30:08.720 --> 00:30:10.060
of space and time.

00:30:10.060 --> 00:30:13.610
So they can contribute to
making the universe look

00:30:13.610 --> 00:30:15.940
uniform on large scales.

00:30:15.940 --> 00:30:18.450
The large-scale structure
and also galaxy formation

00:30:18.450 --> 00:30:21.780
might be to do
with neutrino mass.

00:30:21.780 --> 00:30:26.590
Inflation-- So inflation
is really important.

00:30:26.590 --> 00:30:29.630
And the Bank of England
tries to try to deal with it.

00:30:29.630 --> 00:30:34.590
But particle theorists look at
phase transitions of particles

00:30:34.590 --> 00:30:35.880
in the early universe.

00:30:35.880 --> 00:30:37.977
And there are
theories, which have

00:30:37.977 --> 00:30:40.060
really, really heavy
neutrinos, which are partners

00:30:40.060 --> 00:30:41.470
to the ones we observe.

00:30:41.470 --> 00:30:45.800
And the phase transition where
they go out of interaction

00:30:45.800 --> 00:30:47.740
is perhaps driving
the inflation.

00:30:47.740 --> 00:30:49.340
So we need to
understand neutrinos.

00:30:49.340 --> 00:30:52.840
And finally, if you
meet anti-matter,

00:30:52.840 --> 00:30:54.890
you will annihilate.

00:30:54.890 --> 00:30:56.770
There is no anti-matter.

00:30:56.770 --> 00:30:58.150
We can calculate,
from the bodies

00:30:58.150 --> 00:30:59.990
in this room, a
very strong limit

00:30:59.990 --> 00:31:02.930
on the amount of
anti-matter in the universe.

00:31:02.930 --> 00:31:06.082
And nobody can explain that.

00:31:06.082 --> 00:31:07.330
And there are theories.

00:31:07.330 --> 00:31:09.080
So they're the same
as the ones that

00:31:09.080 --> 00:31:10.840
are generating
this inflation that

00:31:10.840 --> 00:31:12.090
take all the anti-matter away.

00:31:12.090 --> 00:31:14.620
You really need to
understand neutrinos.

00:31:14.620 --> 00:31:16.630
OK so here's the
evolution of the universe

00:31:16.630 --> 00:31:18.100
on a different scale.

00:31:18.100 --> 00:31:23.260
And what you're seeing is where
the different accelerators

00:31:23.260 --> 00:31:24.250
contribute.

00:31:24.250 --> 00:31:25.825
The LHC, if you
can pick it out--

00:31:25.825 --> 00:31:27.700
I can point to the
screen, but it's useless--

00:31:27.700 --> 00:31:29.920
so you can see where
the LHC contributes.

00:31:29.920 --> 00:31:32.670
Accelerators, today, go
up to the white line,

00:31:32.670 --> 00:31:35.060
which is on the left hand
side-- the vertical white line.

00:31:35.060 --> 00:31:36.590
So you want to go beyond.

00:31:36.590 --> 00:31:39.237
And there have been
two or three ways

00:31:39.237 --> 00:31:41.320
of getting there that have
already been described.

00:31:41.320 --> 00:31:42.920
That's really exciting.

00:31:42.920 --> 00:31:47.231
There's another way, which
I want to explain here.

00:31:47.231 --> 00:31:47.730
Right.

00:31:47.730 --> 00:31:50.734
So there is an electron, that's
what you need to make matter.

00:31:50.734 --> 00:31:52.150
There's another
particle which has

00:31:52.150 --> 00:31:53.550
exactly the same properties.

00:31:53.550 --> 00:31:54.810
It's called the muon.

00:31:54.810 --> 00:31:57.720
The only way it differs from the
electron is that it's 200 times

00:31:57.720 --> 00:31:58.310
as heavy.

00:31:58.310 --> 00:32:01.940
And it decays into an electron,
and actually into neutrinos.

00:32:01.940 --> 00:32:03.820
The fact that it's
200 times as heavy

00:32:03.820 --> 00:32:07.260
makes it technically good
to do the kind of things

00:32:07.260 --> 00:32:09.330
that you can't do with
electrons and positrons.

00:32:09.330 --> 00:32:11.270
So you can accelerate
them-- they're heavy.

00:32:11.270 --> 00:32:12.460
You can do that efficiently.

00:32:12.460 --> 00:32:15.770
And actually, you can show that
it's more cost effective if you

00:32:15.770 --> 00:32:17.290
can produce enough of them.

00:32:17.290 --> 00:32:18.170
They decay.

00:32:18.170 --> 00:32:21.070
In particular, they decay
democratically into muon

00:32:21.070 --> 00:32:22.200
and electron neutrinos.

00:32:22.200 --> 00:32:25.140
And that's critical for what
you need to do the science.

00:32:25.140 --> 00:32:28.960
You need new E's because you
need to look at transitions

00:32:28.960 --> 00:32:31.790
that are not disappearing.

00:32:31.790 --> 00:32:34.720
So you need to see a neutrino
turn into something else.

00:32:34.720 --> 00:32:37.601
So Nu is the symbol you give
for the neutrino, right?

00:32:37.601 --> 00:32:38.100
Yeah.

00:32:38.100 --> 00:32:40.180
Thank you, Susie.

00:32:40.180 --> 00:32:43.092
OK, so for both the
energy frontier--

00:32:43.092 --> 00:32:45.550
so how do you get the very,
very high energy and how do you

00:32:45.550 --> 00:32:47.290
study the properties
of neutrinos?--

00:32:47.290 --> 00:32:50.120
muons are ideal because
they're heavy and they decay

00:32:50.120 --> 00:32:52.630
to the right particles.

00:32:52.630 --> 00:32:53.610
There is a problem.

00:32:53.610 --> 00:32:54.880
And that is that they decay.

00:32:54.880 --> 00:32:56.790
So the advantage is
also the disadvantage.

00:32:56.790 --> 00:33:01.290
They decay in 2.2 microseconds
if they are not moving.

00:33:01.290 --> 00:33:03.720
And you produce them
from the decay of pions.

00:33:03.720 --> 00:33:06.010
So once you've got your
muons, they typically

00:33:06.010 --> 00:33:07.490
occupy a large volume.

00:33:07.490 --> 00:33:09.610
So I want you to
think of a watermelon

00:33:09.610 --> 00:33:11.080
in a three-dimensional space.

00:33:11.080 --> 00:33:12.390
But they're highly divergent.

00:33:12.390 --> 00:33:15.350
The cost of your
acceleration is roughly

00:33:15.350 --> 00:33:17.230
going as the size, squared.

00:33:17.230 --> 00:33:18.940
And then you've got
the stored energy.

00:33:18.940 --> 00:33:21.780
So there's a real premium
in making it smaller.

00:33:21.780 --> 00:33:24.250
To study neutrinos you
gotta turn the watermelon

00:33:24.250 --> 00:33:27.250
into a cucumber because
the length is OK,

00:33:27.250 --> 00:33:29.760
but the width you've
got to shrink down.

00:33:29.760 --> 00:33:32.120
And so that means that
what we have to do

00:33:32.120 --> 00:33:34.750
is demonstrate a technique
to reduce the face space.

00:33:34.750 --> 00:33:36.020
That's ionization cooling.

00:33:36.020 --> 00:33:37.550
What we-- ah, I can't point.

00:33:37.550 --> 00:33:40.660
What we do is we shoot the
muon beam through an absorber,

00:33:40.660 --> 00:33:44.144
it loses energy, that
means the momentum

00:33:44.144 --> 00:33:46.310
transverse to the beam and
the longitudinal momentum

00:33:46.310 --> 00:33:47.790
go down equally.

00:33:47.790 --> 00:33:49.360
You accelerate in one direction.

00:33:49.360 --> 00:33:51.650
That means the
ratio has gone down

00:33:51.650 --> 00:33:53.904
and you've squeezed
the beam down.

00:33:53.904 --> 00:33:55.570
Experiment we're doing
at Rutherford lab

00:33:55.570 --> 00:33:57.360
now is going to
demonstrate that.

00:33:57.360 --> 00:33:59.650
So you look at the top,
which is the concept.

00:33:59.650 --> 00:34:01.520
You can see how we
want to realize it.

00:34:01.520 --> 00:34:03.550
And that's what it
looks like in the hole.

00:34:03.550 --> 00:34:05.220
So I'm only saying
that we're going

00:34:05.220 --> 00:34:06.790
to demonstrate
the key technology

00:34:06.790 --> 00:34:08.850
and then we can make the
accelerators that can do

00:34:08.850 --> 00:34:11.230
what I just tried to explain.

00:34:11.230 --> 00:34:14.960
And to finish on the size of
this thing-- on the left hand

00:34:14.960 --> 00:34:16.679
side, with the red
squiggle, you can

00:34:16.679 --> 00:34:20.730
see the border of the Fermi
National Accelerator Laboratory

00:34:20.730 --> 00:34:22.280
in the US.

00:34:22.280 --> 00:34:25.170
And you can see the muon
collider fitting on that site.

00:34:25.170 --> 00:34:28.179
For comparison, you
can see the LHC, that's

00:34:28.179 --> 00:34:31.949
the blue circle, the ILC, which
is the green line, or CLIC,

00:34:31.949 --> 00:34:34.760
and on the right hand side is
what used be called the VLHC.

00:34:34.760 --> 00:34:37.120
So it's, roughly
speaking, the FCC

00:34:37.120 --> 00:34:38.810
that Frank was just describing.

00:34:38.810 --> 00:34:42.030
So it's not that-- so these
are different techniques,

00:34:42.030 --> 00:34:43.940
they do slightly
different science,

00:34:43.940 --> 00:34:46.197
and I think there's
a great strength

00:34:46.197 --> 00:34:47.780
in the breadth of
science that you can

00:34:47.780 --> 00:34:49.370
do with these different things.

00:34:49.370 --> 00:34:49.850
Thank you very much.

00:34:49.850 --> 00:34:50.400
OK.

00:34:50.400 --> 00:34:51.360
Thank you, Chris.

00:34:56.060 --> 00:34:58.700
So one of the key things I
should point out at this stage

00:34:58.700 --> 00:35:00.910
is that one of the
useful things about muons

00:35:00.910 --> 00:35:02.710
is, because they're
slightly heavier,

00:35:02.710 --> 00:35:04.800
they emit less
synchrotron radiation.

00:35:04.800 --> 00:35:07.662
So this issue of the
being losing energy

00:35:07.662 --> 00:35:09.620
as it goes around the
ring is not such an issue

00:35:09.620 --> 00:35:11.450
in the muon collider, right?

00:35:11.450 --> 00:35:12.120
Could I--

00:35:12.120 --> 00:35:12.620
Yeah.

00:35:12.620 --> 00:35:14.060
So I think that
the point to make

00:35:14.060 --> 00:35:15.660
is that, if you're
radiating energy,

00:35:15.660 --> 00:35:17.430
but you want to keep
colliding at the same energy,

00:35:17.430 --> 00:35:18.730
you got to put the energy back.

00:35:18.730 --> 00:35:21.260
And that has to come out
of the power station.

00:35:21.260 --> 00:35:25.020
So if you radiate less energy,
you have to put less power in.

00:35:25.020 --> 00:35:26.915
And that's why there
is an energy, about one

00:35:26.915 --> 00:35:29.080
and a half TeV, where
the muon colliders are

00:35:29.080 --> 00:35:33.660
more cost effective to
operate, maybe not to build.

00:35:33.660 --> 00:35:34.830
OK.

00:35:34.830 --> 00:35:38.736
Right, so now onto something
completely different.

00:35:38.736 --> 00:35:40.360
Yeah, I don't think
I need to introduce

00:35:40.360 --> 00:35:42.401
any further than that,
just completely different.

00:35:42.401 --> 00:35:43.698
Go ahead, Stuart.

00:35:43.698 --> 00:35:45.960
Hang on-- oh.

00:35:45.960 --> 00:35:47.990
Starting on the wrong one.

00:35:47.990 --> 00:35:51.640
So, so far, you've heard about
all these different particle

00:35:51.640 --> 00:35:53.740
accelerators and
future projects.

00:35:53.740 --> 00:35:55.710
And I think they have
one thing in common--

00:35:55.710 --> 00:35:57.800
they're all massive machines.

00:35:57.800 --> 00:36:01.010
And so the question
I'm looking at

00:36:01.010 --> 00:36:03.340
is, why are they so big,
and more importantly,

00:36:03.340 --> 00:36:05.520
can we make them a lot smaller?

00:36:05.520 --> 00:36:08.800
So Phil was right, I'm not sure
if I agree about the 50 years.

00:36:08.800 --> 00:36:12.047
But what we are talking
about a technology

00:36:12.047 --> 00:36:14.005
that could be used a bit
further in the future.

00:36:14.005 --> 00:36:15.530
I'm very happy with that.

00:36:15.530 --> 00:36:17.440
Yeah

00:36:17.440 --> 00:36:21.480
And so, again, compulsory
picture-- overhead picture

00:36:21.480 --> 00:36:23.430
of a big accelerator.

00:36:23.430 --> 00:36:25.630
I went for SI units
rather than miles.

00:36:25.630 --> 00:36:28.220
It's about three
kilometers long.

00:36:28.220 --> 00:36:30.605
This is slack in America.

00:36:30.605 --> 00:36:32.980
And the thing is, that all of
these particle accelerators

00:36:32.980 --> 00:36:35.600
are basically using
the same technology

00:36:35.600 --> 00:36:37.490
to accelerate particles.

00:36:37.490 --> 00:36:40.480
Whether or not they're
accelerating electrons,

00:36:40.480 --> 00:36:43.740
protons, or muons they're
using an electric field

00:36:43.740 --> 00:36:46.970
to accelerate a particle
inside a vacuum tube.

00:36:46.970 --> 00:36:50.330
So it's a low-pressure vessel
with nothing inside it.

00:36:50.330 --> 00:36:52.480
And then you put a
radio frequency wave

00:36:52.480 --> 00:36:55.690
traveling through it, which
accelerates the particles up

00:36:55.690 --> 00:36:57.150
as it goes along.

00:36:57.150 --> 00:37:01.990
You can work out the energy
that your charged particle can

00:37:01.990 --> 00:37:05.147
get up to by just taking the
strength of the electric field,

00:37:05.147 --> 00:37:07.730
which is measured in volts per
meter-- or megavolts per meter,

00:37:07.730 --> 00:37:11.650
if you like-- million volts
per meter-- by the distance.

00:37:11.650 --> 00:37:14.350
Because they're all using
basically the same technology,

00:37:14.350 --> 00:37:18.860
they're all working at
around about 10 to 10--

00:37:18.860 --> 00:37:21.260
right at the top end--
100 megavolts per meter.

00:37:21.260 --> 00:37:23.180
So just some very simple
math, that tells you,

00:37:23.180 --> 00:37:25.240
if you want to get a
particle to just 1 GeV,

00:37:25.240 --> 00:37:30.120
you still need 10 to 100
meters of accelerator.

00:37:30.120 --> 00:37:32.024
If you want to get
to 100 GeV, you

00:37:32.024 --> 00:37:33.440
need, depending
on the technology,

00:37:33.440 --> 00:37:35.110
between 10 and 100 kilometers.

00:37:35.110 --> 00:37:38.340
I didn't put 100 TeV on there.

00:37:38.340 --> 00:37:39.930
But that was with those numbers.

00:37:39.930 --> 00:37:43.781
And so effectively, the only
way we can make things shorter

00:37:43.781 --> 00:37:45.030
is-- well, there are two ways.

00:37:45.030 --> 00:37:47.510
One is we can use the same
accelerating structure over

00:37:47.510 --> 00:37:49.510
and over again, which is
a circular accelerator.

00:37:49.510 --> 00:37:53.740
But then we hit the problem of
magnet strength and synchotron

00:37:53.740 --> 00:37:54.694
radiation.

00:37:54.694 --> 00:37:56.610
Or we can turn up the
electric field strength.

00:37:56.610 --> 00:37:59.200
They're basically the
only two things we can do.

00:37:59.200 --> 00:38:03.190
In fact, the technology to get
up to 100 megavolts per meter,

00:38:03.190 --> 00:38:04.850
that's already really hard.

00:38:04.850 --> 00:38:07.130
That's a really
cutting edge technology

00:38:07.130 --> 00:38:09.525
in vacuum accelerators.

00:38:12.007 --> 00:38:13.340
So why can't they go any higher?

00:38:13.340 --> 00:38:15.381
Well the problem is-- I
don't know if you've ever

00:38:15.381 --> 00:38:17.400
tried this-- but if
you have two electrodes

00:38:17.400 --> 00:38:19.460
and you put a lot of
voltage between them in air,

00:38:19.460 --> 00:38:21.650
you get a spark
forming between them.

00:38:21.650 --> 00:38:27.830
If you turn down the pressure--
so if you put that capacitor

00:38:27.830 --> 00:38:31.390
in vacuum-- you can put a
larger voltage before the vacuum

00:38:31.390 --> 00:38:33.000
before you get breakdown.

00:38:33.000 --> 00:38:35.730
But it doesn't matter how
low in pressure you go,

00:38:35.730 --> 00:38:37.880
you will always get to the
point where there's just

00:38:37.880 --> 00:38:40.160
one electron-- one or two
electrons between those two

00:38:40.160 --> 00:38:42.020
plates and that will
cause an avalanche that

00:38:42.020 --> 00:38:44.050
will mean that you
get sparks forming

00:38:44.050 --> 00:38:45.390
inside your accelerator.

00:38:45.390 --> 00:38:47.640
And that's the sort of
fundamental limit of why,

00:38:47.640 --> 00:38:51.080
if you're using this
conventional technology

00:38:51.080 --> 00:38:53.280
to accelerate things,
you can't go any higher

00:38:53.280 --> 00:38:55.620
than about 100
megavolts per meter.

00:38:55.620 --> 00:38:57.580
And that's because
you turn up the field,

00:38:57.580 --> 00:38:59.634
and it's just going to
start forming sparks,

00:38:59.634 --> 00:39:01.050
which degrade the
whole structure,

00:39:01.050 --> 00:39:02.950
they may even destroy it.

00:39:02.950 --> 00:39:07.260
And so if you like, what
I'm trying to look at--

00:39:07.260 --> 00:39:10.600
and I have been over the
last decade or so-- is,

00:39:10.600 --> 00:39:12.690
could we do something else?

00:39:12.690 --> 00:39:16.160
Could we actually solve
this breakdown problem

00:39:16.160 --> 00:39:18.945
and start with something that
either-- well, one thing,

00:39:18.945 --> 00:39:19.980
it would be nice if you
could find something

00:39:19.980 --> 00:39:21.146
that just didn't break down.

00:39:21.146 --> 00:39:22.500
Not sure that exists.

00:39:22.500 --> 00:39:24.460
But instead, actually
do the exhilaration

00:39:24.460 --> 00:39:26.260
in something that's
already broken down.

00:39:26.260 --> 00:39:30.010
So if you take a volume of
gas, and you fully ionize it,

00:39:30.010 --> 00:39:31.290
it can't ionize anymore.

00:39:31.290 --> 00:39:32.920
And actually, that's
called a plasma.

00:39:32.920 --> 00:39:35.310
And plasmas can support
huge electric fields.

00:39:38.980 --> 00:39:42.350
I think we have already
demonstrated, sort of,

00:39:42.350 --> 00:39:45.266
fairly useful fields,
depending on your definition,

00:39:45.266 --> 00:39:48.650
at 10,000 megavolts per meter.

00:39:48.650 --> 00:39:52.410
So just to give you
an idea, I would

00:39:52.410 --> 00:39:54.660
say, compared to conventional
accelerators in its very

00:39:54.660 --> 00:39:57.540
early days-- we've been
doing things for a while,

00:39:57.540 --> 00:39:59.784
in my lifetime, and
in terms of how long

00:39:59.784 --> 00:40:01.825
I've been doing it and
significantly before me as

00:40:01.825 --> 00:40:07.910
well-- but there are-- did
my microphone just go off?

00:40:07.910 --> 00:40:09.910
Yeah, it's come back on.

00:40:09.910 --> 00:40:12.770
But there are definitely
things going on.

00:40:12.770 --> 00:40:15.850
So this picture
here is an overview

00:40:15.850 --> 00:40:18.890
of the Rutherford Appleton
Lab, one of the national labs

00:40:18.890 --> 00:40:19.770
in the UK here.

00:40:19.770 --> 00:40:23.640
And there are three GeV-- so
small-- particle accelerators

00:40:23.640 --> 00:40:24.900
in this picture.

00:40:24.900 --> 00:40:27.620
The first one is
at the top here.

00:40:27.620 --> 00:40:29.060
That's the diamond light source.

00:40:29.060 --> 00:40:31.100
It's a machine not for
doing particle physics

00:40:31.100 --> 00:40:33.200
but for making x-rays for
all sorts of scientists.

00:40:33.200 --> 00:40:37.690
And at the heart of it
is a 3 GeV electron beam.

00:40:37.690 --> 00:40:41.800
In the bottom here is ISIS,
which is a neutron source.

00:40:41.800 --> 00:40:44.380
And those neutrons are made by
accelerating protons and using

00:40:44.380 --> 00:40:47.930
a process called spallation
to make neutrons.

00:40:47.930 --> 00:40:50.720
And at the heart of that is 1
GeV proton accelerator-- .8,

00:40:50.720 --> 00:40:52.350
I think.

00:40:52.350 --> 00:40:54.700
So they're all
pretty big machines.

00:40:54.700 --> 00:40:57.360
Somewhere in that
building, in there, there

00:40:57.360 --> 00:41:01.940
is a pretty big laser called
Astro Gemini, which we're

00:41:01.940 --> 00:41:04.824
now fairly routinely
producing-- very messy compared

00:41:04.824 --> 00:41:06.740
to the beams that come
out of these machines--

00:41:06.740 --> 00:41:09.740
but 2 GeV beams
inside that lab there.

00:41:09.740 --> 00:41:13.200
The actual accelerator
is this long.

00:41:13.200 --> 00:41:15.890
So the actual plasmal
part is that long.

00:41:15.890 --> 00:41:19.230
And so the technology
we're working on

00:41:19.230 --> 00:41:21.170
is-- I really liked what
Phil said, which was,

00:41:21.170 --> 00:41:23.880
if you could imagine replacing
conventional accelerators

00:41:23.880 --> 00:41:25.900
with a plasma system,
you could suddenly

00:41:25.900 --> 00:41:27.259
make a massive upgrade.

00:41:27.259 --> 00:41:29.550
So that's the sort of thing--
the time scale we think--

00:41:29.550 --> 00:41:31.576
I think seems realistic.

00:41:31.576 --> 00:41:34.200
But just to give you an idea of
how much progress we're making,

00:41:34.200 --> 00:41:37.940
here, I've got a plot from
one of my PhD student's

00:41:37.940 --> 00:41:40.230
thesis, Jason Cole.

00:41:40.230 --> 00:41:45.050
So he took conventional electron
accelerators and there, energy

00:41:45.050 --> 00:41:47.120
as a function of
time-- so you can see

00:41:47.120 --> 00:41:49.270
they started back in the 1940s.

00:41:49.270 --> 00:41:52.230
And they made rapid progress
for the first 30 years,

00:41:52.230 --> 00:41:54.790
doubling energy about every
two years, I think it was.

00:41:54.790 --> 00:41:56.500
And then it kind of tailed off.

00:41:56.500 --> 00:41:59.000
And then you get plasma
accelerators which basically

00:41:59.000 --> 00:42:00.710
started in the mid 90s.

00:42:00.710 --> 00:42:05.580
And we've been making similar
progress over the last 10

00:42:05.580 --> 00:42:07.330
years-- 10, 20 years as well.

00:42:07.330 --> 00:42:11.720
So our record is now,
the group at Berkeley

00:42:11.720 --> 00:42:13.490
have now produced 4
GeV electron beams

00:42:13.490 --> 00:42:17.700
in a plasma that's 9
centimeters long, so that big.

00:42:17.700 --> 00:42:20.310
And that corresponds to
an accelerating field that

00:42:20.310 --> 00:42:22.752
is 10,000 megavolts per meter.

00:42:22.752 --> 00:42:24.460
So I haven't done the
numbers, but if you

00:42:24.460 --> 00:42:26.520
wanted to do this
100 TeV machine,

00:42:26.520 --> 00:42:29.240
if you could use that it
would get a lot shorter.

00:42:29.240 --> 00:42:30.490
So that's what I'm working on.

00:42:30.490 --> 00:42:31.760
Thank you very much

00:42:31.760 --> 00:42:32.260
OK.

00:42:32.260 --> 00:42:33.900
Thanks.
