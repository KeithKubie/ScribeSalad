00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.740
The graph of the function g is shown below

00:00:03.810 --> 00:00:06.546
What is the input value for which g of x

00:00:06.694 --> 00:00:08.801
is equal to negative 2?

00:00:08.806 --> 00:00:11.836
So what they do here is along the x axis

00:00:11.856 --> 00:00:14.536
these are the inputs and then the graph

00:00:14.623 --> 00:00:16.263
shows us what's the output

00:00:16.294 --> 00:00:17.804
so when x is equal to 7,

00:00:17.903 --> 00:00:19.973
G of 7 we see here is 1.

00:00:20.003 --> 00:00:22.263
If x equals 9,

00:00:22.297 --> 00:00:24.259
g of 9 here is 2.

00:00:24.259 --> 00:00:25.739
If x equals 6,

00:00:25.739 --> 00:00:30.259
g of 6 is equal to the y coordinate at

00:00:30.259 --> 00:00:31.760
this point is equal to 0.

00:00:31.760 --> 00:00:35.480
so what is the input value for which g is

00:00:35.490 --> 00:00:37.783
equal to negative 2?

00:00:37.873 --> 00:00:40.293
so this graph over here, this is y equals

00:00:40.293 --> 00:00:41.363
g of x.

00:00:41.363 --> 00:00:43.768
So g of x equaling to negative 2 means y

00:00:43.771 --> 00:00:45.241
of x is equal to negative 2

00:00:45.251 --> 00:00:47.776
And so when does y equal negative 2?

00:00:47.776 --> 00:00:49.786
(muttering) when does equal negative 2?

00:00:49.786 --> 00:00:51.854
(talking) it looks like that happens right

00:00:51.854 --> 00:00:52.774
at this point.

00:00:52.778 --> 00:00:55.528
And that happens when you input negative 9

00:00:55.548 --> 00:00:56.519
into g.

00:00:56.519 --> 00:00:59.715
g of negative 9 is negative 2

00:00:59.715 --> 00:01:02.762
so this is going to be negative 9.

00:01:02.772 --> 00:01:05.802
And we're done.
