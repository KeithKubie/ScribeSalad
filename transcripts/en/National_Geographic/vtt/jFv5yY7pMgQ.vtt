00:00:01.100 --> 00:00:03.200
PHIL KEOGHAN: Nuclear power
has been a reliable source

00:00:03.200 --> 00:00:06.133
of energy for 70 years.

00:00:06.133 --> 00:00:08.567
But it comes with the
risk of a meltdown,

00:00:08.567 --> 00:00:13.834
as we saw in Chernobyl in
1986 and Fukushima in 2011.

00:00:13.834 --> 00:00:18.800
After Chernobyl, Russia ordered
a 1,600 square mile area around

00:00:18.800 --> 00:00:21.400
the plant abandoned forever.

00:00:21.400 --> 00:00:24.333
But a very different plan
is underway in Fukushima.

00:00:24.333 --> 00:00:29.333
Here's correspondent
Mariana van Zeller in Japan.

00:00:29.333 --> 00:00:31.400
[buzzer sounding]

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:36.867
BRET BAIER: The Fukushima
Daiichi nuclear power plant

00:00:36.867 --> 00:00:40.333
has reportedly lost
control, after an earthquake

00:00:40.333 --> 00:00:42.967
and tsunami a meltdown.

00:00:42.967 --> 00:00:47.266
The radiation is streaming
out of the Daiichi complex.

00:00:47.266 --> 00:00:49.833
BARACK OBAMA: This is a
catastrophic disaster.

00:00:49.834 --> 00:00:51.700
[ominous music playing]

00:00:58.400 --> 00:00:59.867
MARIANA VAN ZELLER:
I'm here in Fukushima,

00:00:59.867 --> 00:01:04.432
exploring one of the towns
abandoned by the disaster.

00:01:04.433 --> 00:01:09.667
Radiation is still too high
for people to live here.

00:01:09.667 --> 00:01:12.867
This looks like it used
to be a beauty salon.

00:01:12.867 --> 00:01:15.433
It had a lot of damage.

00:01:15.433 --> 00:01:19.767
This looks like it used to
be a flower or plant shop.

00:01:19.767 --> 00:01:23.567
We have to be very careful with
what we touch or where we step,

00:01:23.567 --> 00:01:27.699
because there's all this sort of
radioactive dust and particles

00:01:27.700 --> 00:01:29.567
everywhere.

00:01:29.567 --> 00:01:30.199
Oh, wow.

00:01:30.200 --> 00:01:32.767
Look at this.

00:01:32.767 --> 00:01:35.433
Whoa.

00:01:35.433 --> 00:01:38.300
This was a retirement home.

00:01:38.300 --> 00:01:40.567
Everywhere, there's
just evidence of panic

00:01:40.567 --> 00:01:43.500
to get out of here
as fast as possible.

00:01:43.500 --> 00:01:47.000
It's really a time
capsule of a really bad

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:49.567
disaster that happened here.

00:01:49.567 --> 00:01:52.567
[music playing]

00:01:52.567 --> 00:01:56.100
The Daiichi nuclear power plant
sits on the easternmost edge

00:01:56.100 --> 00:01:58.500
of the Fukushima prefecture.

00:01:58.500 --> 00:02:01.600
When it blew, it spewed
radiation across dozens

00:02:01.600 --> 00:02:06.032
of towns, triggering a 12-mile
evacuation zone that's still

00:02:06.033 --> 00:02:07.834
partially in effect today.

00:02:07.834 --> 00:02:11.667
The plant itself is still
the most hazardous site.

00:02:11.667 --> 00:02:14.467
If Japan is encouraging
people to move back,

00:02:14.467 --> 00:02:16.700
how have conditions
improved in the seven years

00:02:16.700 --> 00:02:17.433
since the disaster?

00:02:20.500 --> 00:02:22.767
I'm meeting up with
radiation researcher,

00:02:22.767 --> 00:02:25.834
Azby Brown, who was able
to get special access

00:02:25.834 --> 00:02:27.500
to take us to the plant.

00:02:27.500 --> 00:02:30.000
AZBY BROWN: Let's head out.

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:32.100
MARIANA VAN ZELLER: So this
is an area that people passed

00:02:32.100 --> 00:02:33.500
[inaudible]

00:02:33.500 --> 00:02:34.633
AZBY BROWN: You need
permission to get in there.

00:02:34.633 --> 00:02:36.033
So we've obtained
the permission.

00:02:36.033 --> 00:02:37.166
MARIANA VAN ZELLER:
Azby says we're

00:02:37.166 --> 00:02:38.834
OK to spend a short time there.

00:02:38.834 --> 00:02:43.700
But I'm going to play it safe,
and stay in my protective gear.

00:02:43.700 --> 00:02:45.566
[ominous music playing]

00:02:54.967 --> 00:02:56.066
Whoa.
AZBY BROWN: Yup.

00:02:56.066 --> 00:02:57.000
That's it.

00:02:57.000 --> 00:03:00.133
Fukushima Daiichi.

00:03:00.133 --> 00:03:02.200
MARIANA VAN ZELLER:
We are so close.

00:03:02.200 --> 00:03:04.500
So no one has been in
there since the disaster?

00:03:04.500 --> 00:03:07.000
AZBY BROWN: Actually, there's
5,000 people working there.

00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:08.266
It's a massive cleanup.

00:03:08.266 --> 00:03:09.733
They can get into
parts of the buildings,

00:03:09.734 --> 00:03:12.700
but they send robots in to
take video and to do work.

00:03:12.700 --> 00:03:13.767
MARIANA VAN ZELLER: Wow.

00:03:13.767 --> 00:03:14.934
AZBY BROWN: People
can't even go in there,

00:03:14.934 --> 00:03:15.966
the radiation is so high.

00:03:15.967 --> 00:03:17.300
It's thousands of times higher--

00:03:17.300 --> 00:03:18.500
MARIANA VAN ZELLER: Than
what it is right here?

00:03:18.500 --> 00:03:19.800
AZBY BROWN: Yeah, than here.

00:03:19.800 --> 00:03:20.967
MARIANA VAN ZELLER:
How long would a person

00:03:20.967 --> 00:03:22.000
be able survive in there?

00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:23.300
AZBY BROWN: A couple of minutes.

00:03:23.300 --> 00:03:24.734
You would get so much
radiation, damaging

00:03:24.734 --> 00:03:26.633
and killing your
cells, that your organs

00:03:26.633 --> 00:03:27.767
would start to fail.

00:03:27.767 --> 00:03:30.367
There may be some way to
clean it up in 20 years

00:03:30.367 --> 00:03:31.632
or so, to make it livable.

00:03:31.633 --> 00:03:36.066
But it's an incredibly
daunting task.

00:03:36.066 --> 00:03:37.367
MARIANA VAN ZELLER:
Still, Japan has

00:03:37.367 --> 00:03:40.200
taken on the most
extensive nuclear cleanup

00:03:40.200 --> 00:03:41.966
ever attempted worldwide.

00:03:41.967 --> 00:03:44.667
The government claims that
by removing the top inches

00:03:44.667 --> 00:03:47.100
of soil, where
toxins have settled,

00:03:47.100 --> 00:03:49.600
it will make the land
safe again to live.

00:03:49.600 --> 00:03:53.433
For seven years, workers have
been moving inch by inch, town

00:03:53.433 --> 00:03:56.500
by town, digging out
layers of poisonous waste,

00:03:56.500 --> 00:03:59.700
dropping it into plastic
bags, and storing it

00:03:59.700 --> 00:04:02.500
at temporary sites.

00:04:02.500 --> 00:04:05.700
These are all bags
with the nuclear waste.

00:04:05.700 --> 00:04:08.200
I mean, it looks like
hundreds of thousands of bags

00:04:08.200 --> 00:04:10.200
just on this one site.

00:04:10.200 --> 00:04:13.232
In parking lots, fields,
and abandoned yards,

00:04:13.233 --> 00:04:15.900
throughout Fukushima,
there are 9 million

00:04:15.900 --> 00:04:18.667
bags of waste, and counting.

00:04:18.666 --> 00:04:20.566
[ominous music playing]

00:04:25.467 --> 00:04:28.567
Japan says the cleanup
effort is working,

00:04:28.567 --> 00:04:31.166
and towns on the edge
of the evacuation zone

00:04:31.166 --> 00:04:33.500
are safe to resettle.

00:04:33.500 --> 00:04:36.867
In 2015, they deemed
Naraha, 12 miles

00:04:36.867 --> 00:04:41.533
south of the reactor site, the
first town ready to reopen.

00:04:41.533 --> 00:04:46.166
Yet less than half of the
7,400 residents returned.

00:04:46.166 --> 00:04:50.400
[speaking japanese]

00:04:50.400 --> 00:04:52.633
You have a beautiful house.

00:04:52.633 --> 00:04:54.834
How long have you
lived here for?

00:04:54.834 --> 00:04:57.400
[speaking japanese]

00:04:57.400 --> 00:05:00.433
About a year and a half
after Naraha reopened,

00:05:00.433 --> 00:05:03.266
the government cut off
subsidies paying for evacuees

00:05:03.266 --> 00:05:05.033
to live in temporary housing.

00:05:05.033 --> 00:05:06.967
They hoped residents
would come home,

00:05:06.967 --> 00:05:09.000
but many chose to
move elsewhere.

00:05:09.000 --> 00:05:10.433
Oh, wow.

00:05:10.433 --> 00:05:12.400
And although the government
claims the land is safe,

00:05:12.400 --> 00:05:14.000
Yanai is not convinced.

00:05:14.000 --> 00:05:17.533
So he's willing to put his life
in danger to cleanup his place.

00:05:17.533 --> 00:05:19.633
Most of the places
around here, it's

00:05:19.633 --> 00:05:23.599
the government workers that are
removing the contaminated soil.

00:05:23.600 --> 00:05:25.900
But you've decided
to do it yourself.

00:05:25.900 --> 00:05:26.967
Why?

00:05:26.967 --> 00:05:31.099
[speaking japanese]

00:05:31.100 --> 00:05:32.300
How much time did that take you?

00:05:32.300 --> 00:05:34.433
[speaking japanese]

00:05:34.433 --> 00:05:36.800
Can you show me how you do it?

00:05:36.800 --> 00:05:38.633
[music playing]

00:05:45.867 --> 00:05:47.734
The top layer is all toxic soil.

00:05:47.734 --> 00:05:52.834
So in order to decontaminate
it, you really have to excavate.

00:05:52.834 --> 00:06:11.767
[speaking japanese]

00:06:11.767 --> 00:06:13.633
[music playing]

00:06:17.867 --> 00:06:20.767
It's not just fear of
radiation preventing residents

00:06:20.767 --> 00:06:22.300
from returning to Naraha.

00:06:22.300 --> 00:06:24.700
[speaking japanese.]

00:06:24.700 --> 00:06:26.500
MARIANA VAN ZELLER: After
years of abandonment,

00:06:26.500 --> 00:06:30.033
towns in the area have
been overrun by wild boars.

00:06:30.033 --> 00:06:33.500
They're ravaging homes, and
everything in their path.

00:06:33.500 --> 00:06:42.467
FUKUO FURUICHI:
[speaking japanese]

00:06:42.467 --> 00:06:44.332
MARIANA VAN ZELLER: The boars
are not on the aggressive

00:06:44.333 --> 00:06:47.467
and known to attack,
they're radioactive.

00:06:47.467 --> 00:06:53.332
FUKUO FURUICHI:
[speaking japanese]

00:06:53.333 --> 00:06:55.333
MARIANA VAN ZELLER: How many
boars have you caught this way?

00:06:55.333 --> 00:06:57.333
FUKUO FURUICHI:
[speaking japanese]

00:06:57.333 --> 00:06:59.433
MARIANA VAN ZELLER: 2,000 hogs?

00:06:59.433 --> 00:07:02.734
FUKUO FURUICHI:
[speaking japanese]

00:07:02.734 --> 00:07:04.532
MARIANA VAN ZELLER: So
when the boar comes in,

00:07:04.533 --> 00:07:08.066
he triggers the wire
and the gates close?

00:07:08.066 --> 00:07:08.933
Whoa.

00:07:08.934 --> 00:07:11.333
Yes.

00:07:11.333 --> 00:07:17.066
FUKUO FURUICHI:
[speaking japanese]

00:07:17.066 --> 00:07:18.633
MARIANA VAN ZELLER:
So he's saying

00:07:18.633 --> 00:07:20.265
we have to go because they think
they've caught another boar

00:07:20.266 --> 00:07:21.367
in one of the other
traps and they

00:07:21.367 --> 00:07:23.767
want to go check it right now.

00:07:23.767 --> 00:07:25.933
[music playing]

00:07:25.934 --> 00:07:27.100
It's dangerous?

00:07:27.100 --> 00:07:28.266
FUKUO FURUICHI:
[speaking japanese]

00:07:28.266 --> 00:07:29.433
MARIANA VAN ZELLER:
They attack you?

00:07:29.433 --> 00:07:33.667
FUKUO FURUICHI:
[speaking japanese]

00:07:33.667 --> 00:07:35.265
MARIANA VAN ZELLER: I
think it's right there.

00:07:35.266 --> 00:07:38.367
It's being held by
something around his foot.

00:07:38.367 --> 00:07:39.633
FUKUO FURUICHI:
[speaking japanese]

00:07:39.633 --> 00:07:41.000
MARIANA VAN ZELLER:
Don't get too close.

00:07:41.000 --> 00:07:45.633
FUKUO FURUICHI:
[speaking japanese]

00:07:45.633 --> 00:07:47.000
MARIANA VAN ZELLER:
It's a big one.

00:07:47.000 --> 00:07:50.967
FUKUO FURUICHI:
[speaking japanese]

00:07:50.967 --> 00:07:52.133
MARIANA VAN ZELLER: Oh, my god.

00:07:52.133 --> 00:07:56.633
FUKUO FURUICHI:
[speaking japanese]

00:07:56.633 --> 00:07:58.200
MARIANA VAN ZELLER:
He's taking out his gun,

00:07:58.200 --> 00:08:01.066
and he's about to
shoot the-- oh.

00:08:01.066 --> 00:08:02.866
[gunshot]

00:08:06.166 --> 00:08:07.700
That was awful.

00:08:07.700 --> 00:08:11.900
He shot him right on the head,
and he's dying right now.

00:08:11.900 --> 00:08:13.299
This is really sad to watch.

00:08:16.734 --> 00:08:20.066
[music playing]

00:08:20.066 --> 00:08:22.833
The challenges in Naraha
seem overwhelming.

00:08:22.834 --> 00:08:26.633
Still, Japan is pushing for
more residents to come home.

00:08:26.633 --> 00:08:28.834
Even with all the
cleanup and rebuilding,

00:08:28.834 --> 00:08:32.967
I can't help wondering,
will it ever be enough?

00:08:32.967 --> 00:08:34.533
Can you give me an
idea of how much

00:08:34.533 --> 00:08:38.366
money has been spent in trying
to get people to come back?

00:08:38.366 --> 00:08:41.366
KENJI OWADA: [speaking japanese]

00:08:41.366 --> 00:08:43.299
MARIANA VAN ZELLER: Can
you guarantee with 100%

00:08:43.299 --> 00:08:45.567
that it's safe right now
for people to come back?

00:08:45.567 --> 00:09:12.467
KENJI OWADA: [speaking japanese]

00:09:12.467 --> 00:09:13.867
MARIANA VAN ZELLER:
We're going to check out

00:09:13.867 --> 00:09:16.433
one of the government's
most significant efforts

00:09:16.433 --> 00:09:18.900
in Naraha, a state
of the art project

00:09:18.900 --> 00:09:23.533
that every community in
the world needs to thrive.

00:09:23.533 --> 00:09:26.367
We're visiting this new
school that they just built.

00:09:26.367 --> 00:09:28.632
Right here in the parking
lot, there is this radiation

00:09:28.633 --> 00:09:31.133
monitor, so that parents,
when they drop off their kids

00:09:31.133 --> 00:09:32.633
at school every
morning, they can

00:09:32.633 --> 00:09:35.133
make sure that it's safe for
the kids to go to school.

00:09:35.133 --> 00:09:37.266
[music playing]

00:09:37.266 --> 00:09:38.699
This is a beautiful school.

00:09:38.700 --> 00:09:42.367
MASANORI SATO:
[speaking japanese]

00:09:42.367 --> 00:09:44.233
MARIANA VAN ZELLER: So because
of the radiation levels,

00:09:44.233 --> 00:09:46.266
you had to demolish
the previous school

00:09:46.266 --> 00:09:47.934
and build an entirely new one?

00:09:47.934 --> 00:09:49.100
MASANORI SATO: Yes.

00:09:49.100 --> 00:09:50.300
MARIANA VAN ZELLER:
What is this?

00:09:50.300 --> 00:09:51.467
MASANORI SATO:
Elementary, sixth grade.

00:09:51.467 --> 00:09:52.633
MARIANA VAN ZELLER:
Sixth graders.

00:09:52.633 --> 00:09:54.133
Oh, chemistry.
MASANORI SATO: Yes.

00:09:54.133 --> 00:09:55.300
MARIANA VAN ZELLER:
They're good students.

00:09:55.300 --> 00:09:56.632
MASANORI SATO:
[speaking japanese]

00:09:56.633 --> 00:09:58.133
MARIANA VAN ZELLER: This
is a beautiful school.

00:09:58.133 --> 00:09:59.967
They spent millions of
dollars building it.

00:09:59.967 --> 00:10:02.033
And yet, it only
has 68 students.

00:10:02.033 --> 00:10:03.700
It's built for 300.

00:10:03.700 --> 00:10:05.200
MASANORI SATO:
[speaking japanese]

00:10:05.200 --> 00:10:06.633
MARIANA VAN ZELLER:
But enrollment

00:10:06.633 --> 00:10:09.300
has doubled since the first
year, a promising sign

00:10:09.300 --> 00:10:11.065
that others will follow.

00:10:11.066 --> 00:10:24.467
MASANORI SATO:
[speaking japanese]

00:10:24.467 --> 00:10:25.533
MARIANA VAN ZELLER: So cute.

00:10:28.633 --> 00:10:39.734
MASANORI SATO:
[speaking japanese]

00:10:39.734 --> 00:10:41.967
MARIANA VAN ZELLER: Children
are actually the most vulnerable

00:10:41.967 --> 00:10:43.500
for radiation.

00:10:43.500 --> 00:10:46.400
So every day, Mr. Ouchi here
prepares all the local food

00:10:46.400 --> 00:10:48.066
that they have from
this region, and then

00:10:48.066 --> 00:10:49.734
tests it for radioactivity.

00:10:49.734 --> 00:10:51.433
Have there have been
times where you've checked

00:10:51.433 --> 00:10:53.500
and the radiation levels
have been too high?

00:10:53.500 --> 00:10:59.734
TAKAO OUCHI: [speaking japanese]

00:10:59.734 --> 00:11:01.200
MARIANA VAN ZELLER:
How many times a day

00:11:01.200 --> 00:11:02.400
do you have to do this?

00:11:02.400 --> 00:11:09.066
TAKAO OUCHI: [speaking japanese]

00:11:09.066 --> 00:11:12.333
MARIANA VAN ZELLER: It's really
crazy, all that they have to go

00:11:12.333 --> 00:11:15.266
through to just make sure
that the food is safe enough

00:11:15.266 --> 00:11:17.599
for the kids here to eat.

00:11:17.600 --> 00:11:19.200
[music playing]

00:11:19.934 --> 00:11:21.300
OK.

00:11:21.300 --> 00:11:22.766
[music playing]

00:11:25.600 --> 00:11:27.967
Coming back from a
disaster of this scale

00:11:27.967 --> 00:11:30.100
is a decades-long endeavor.

00:11:30.100 --> 00:11:32.333
But for some families,
living elsewhere

00:11:32.333 --> 00:11:34.500
is simply not an option.

00:11:34.500 --> 00:11:47.567
SATOKO YAMAUCHI:
[speaking japanese]

00:11:47.567 --> 00:11:50.467
The Yamauchi family
moved back a year ago.

00:11:50.467 --> 00:11:53.766
They had to demolish their old
home, and everything in it.

00:11:53.767 --> 00:11:56.133
They rebuilt from scratch.

00:11:56.133 --> 00:11:58.100
Were you scared to come back?

00:11:58.100 --> 00:11:59.667
SATOKO YAMAUCHI:
[speaking japanese]

00:12:03.367 --> 00:12:21.599
HIROYUKI YAMAUCHI:
[speaking japanese]

00:12:21.600 --> 00:12:39.633
SATOKO YAMAUCHI:
[speaking japanese]

00:12:39.633 --> 00:12:41.467
[music playing]

00:12:44.700 --> 00:12:47.800
MARIANA VAN ZELLER: In 2020,
Fukushima's recovery efforts

00:12:47.800 --> 00:12:50.800
will be center stage at
the Olympic Games in Tokyo,

00:12:50.800 --> 00:12:53.132
150 miles away.

00:12:53.133 --> 00:12:57.867
To honor the region, the torch
relay will begin in Fukushima.

00:12:57.867 --> 00:13:00.599
So I've been in Fukushima
for a few days now.

00:13:00.600 --> 00:13:02.700
And it seems that with
every tragic story,

00:13:02.700 --> 00:13:05.567
there's also a story
about hope, and people

00:13:05.567 --> 00:13:09.467
really trying and fighting to
bring this place back to life.

00:13:12.266 --> 00:13:13.599
[speaking japanese]

00:13:28.233 --> 00:13:29.699
MARIANA VAN ZELLER:
Cheers to Fukushima.
