00:00:04.400 --> 00:00:07.620
my name is Seth Cluett I'm the assistant
director of the sound art program at

00:00:07.620 --> 00:00:12.330
Columbia University and I'm the curator
of "Sounding Circuits: Audible Histories"

00:00:12.330 --> 00:00:16.170
at the Vincent Astor gallery at the New
York Public Library for the Performing

00:00:16.170 --> 00:00:19.650
Arts at Lincoln Center. You know from the
earliest times that I started to get

00:00:19.650 --> 00:00:22.740
interested in electronic music you
always heard about the Columbia-

00:00:22.740 --> 00:00:27.119
Princeton Electronic Music Center and
the RCA Mark 2 Synthesizer and the work

00:00:27.119 --> 00:00:30.869
that happened here in the 70s and 80s
around the development of new

00:00:30.869 --> 00:00:34.829
technologies for electronic music and as
I went through my education it turned

00:00:34.829 --> 00:00:39.870
out I got to know more and more people
associated with Columbia. Since May of

00:00:39.870 --> 00:00:45.149
2017 I've been the artist in residence
at Bell Labs and now I'm in the position

00:00:45.149 --> 00:00:48.930
of the Acting Director at the computer
Music Center and that kind of bookends

00:00:48.930 --> 00:00:53.489
the two poles of early electronic and
computer music Bell Labs was a hotbed of

00:00:53.489 --> 00:00:57.600
early research into speech synthesis and
digital signal processing and anyone who

00:00:57.600 --> 00:01:01.170
was here at Columbia or at Princeton who
wanted to hear their sounds had to go to

00:01:01.170 --> 00:01:04.619
Bell Labs in the 60s in order to render
them on their own the only digital to

00:01:04.619 --> 00:01:09.299
analog converter on the East Coast. People have been amazed at the hardware

00:01:09.299 --> 00:01:14.159
the most that these devices for one
still exist and that they still exist

00:01:14.159 --> 00:01:17.460
here and they're in our collections and in
some case they're still in use in our

00:01:17.460 --> 00:01:23.340
facility and that anyone could use it at
all to make music. I'm creating a series

00:01:23.340 --> 00:01:31.070
suite of seven small works 30 seconds to
a minute long that alternate with eight

00:01:31.070 --> 00:01:35.189
sort of 30-second to a minute long
excerpts from classic pieces of

00:01:35.189 --> 00:01:39.659
electronic and computer music the sphere
uses a kind of audio rendering called

00:01:39.659 --> 00:01:45.210
ambisonics which is a 360 degree audio
experience but the goal is to help

00:01:45.210 --> 00:01:49.700
people understand how fresh these
historic works sound and help give a

00:01:49.700 --> 00:01:55.110
context for some of the impact of those
works on my own practice and what I'm

00:01:55.110 --> 00:01:58.920
hoping with this exhibition to show is
that these are real human beings

00:01:58.920 --> 00:02:02.490
engaging with other real human beings
trying at a time when there are no

00:02:02.490 --> 00:02:08.000
references no precedents to come up with
a new way of making sound

00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:11.270
and I think Columbia and Bell Labs and
the New York Public Library are in a

00:02:11.270 --> 00:02:14.540
very unique position to be able to show
people how vibrant those interactions

00:02:14.540 --> 00:02:16.620
between people were
