Speaker 1:          00:00          No close enough. I'm sure there's no thrill for you. But do you think that being in these incredibly tense environments ramps life up in a way that you don't get outside of it? Like did you, did you read tribe? Sebastian younger look, yeah. And I met him a few times while he was, he was when I was having a few problems. He was, he was very helpful. He was, wasn't he really good guy? Yeah. I really liked that guy. Yeah. Yeah. Before I met him. And he's got that picture in vanity fair, like posing with the dog tag and it's like a muddle looking picture. Guys were tossed her. Yeah. Yeah. And then I met him and he was the nicest, most humble, considerate guy. He's, he's fantastic. And I really like that book as well. Yeah. I couldn't, I couldn't be a bigger fan of his, as a human to just do, just very genuine, really there when you're talking to them.

Speaker 1:          00:47          But that's sort of his take on it is that, um, and if you're listening, I know I talk about that book too much. Uh, I just love it, but his take on it was that these people are experiencing life in this incredibly extreme environment and then they come back to the rest of the world and it just doesn't feel real anymore. So it's not, it's not thrilling when you're there, but it is real drama. You're seeing life and death drama right in front of your face. So when you come back, you think you really want to see this person and see this film, try out this new restaurant and then you get back and you just eat. Just don't care. It's just feel flat. Yeah. Yeah. I mean, you know, when, when I was getting the PTSD treatment, numb, numbness was the word that came out.

Speaker 1:          01:24          More numbness to everything, like numbness to the danger when you're there, but numbness back here for the things that should be pleasurable and should be providing some kind of relief as well. Now, how did the pts PTSD treatment get organizes through maps? Are you part of that study? Yeah, we did a did a short film about, about Rick Doblin and this, this, you know, there's this effort to, to get MDM illegal. Um, but I'd been in denial for years and years. Then a new producer joined vice guy called Steven Bailey and we had the first idea where he was pitching some, some of the first meeting when he was pitching some of his ideas and he mentioned, you know, this breakthrough therapy using MDM may for PTSD. And I just in voluntarily put my hand up and said I'll do it straight away. And I was like, gave me an excuse to actually, you know, get some help and see if actually done MTMA recreationally before that.

Speaker 1:          02:08          I mean, yeah, I came of age in London in the 90s, you know, he was like, it was like having a pint of beer. Then what is the difference between doing it in a therapeutic environment? I mean, it's, it's, it's Mtma assisted therapy, right? The emphasis is on the therapy. So you're lying in a bed if you fasted for 24 hours before the therapist knows you and knows your issues. Um, so knows how to like politely, gently nudge you towards the right topic of conversation, but always makes it, makes you actually get to the conclusions. Um, you know, there are times when I would ask him, why is this happening? Why do I think this? And He'd put it back on me and make me put two and two together. Um, sometimes you listen to music, sometimes you put an eye mask on and you don't sleep, but you just have a quiet 20, 30 minutes.

Speaker 1:          02:53          But it's a, it's a very intense seven to eight hour therapy session and the MD may just enables you to get the benefits. And all of the veterans and first responders who took part in the first round of trials had been therapy resistant. Um, and I think the first round, I think 72% of them got the benefits. And we're considered PTSD free after, after the three month trial. So during the three month trial, how many experiences do they have? One a month. One a month or three? Three. Totally. Yeah. Yeah. I mean the best, the best example I can give of how this works, I had the first veteran I met had been through it. He had one session and he'd lost some friends in Iraq and it felt guilty about it and always thought maybe if I had done something different I could have saved them.

Speaker 1:          03:32          And he imagined being them in in the first Mbma session and they were saying to him, why are you ruining your life? You're alive, you're healthy. We want you to have a fun, productive, full life and enjoy your friends and enjoy your family. And he said that gave him permission and that was what he needed. He didn't even do the second two sessions. Wow. That's a what an interesting way of looking at, of course. And that word permission, because there is so much guilt and just getting permission to just give yourself a bit of a pattern. The survivors of your braking is real. Oh yeah. Yeah. A lot of people that come back from the war that lost friends have that horrible feeling that it should've been them. That they're not as good as the person who died or that somehow or another them being alive is the reason why their friend was dead.

Speaker 1:          04:19          Irrational thoughts or maybe I didn't really experience it because I came out unscathed. Um, yeah, which is one of the reasons why I didn't seek treatment for years and years and years cause I've got friends who've lost their legs. I've got friends who were kidnapped and killed, you know, so maybe I've only just dipped my toes so there's nothing, nothing. I've got nothing to complain about. What was your number one issue? Um, I think the numbness to danger and to, to pleasurable things back here. Um, I mean like my, my camera man in Mosul, we were there when the Iraqi army beat Isis and it was, I mean, it was house to house fighting. We were stepping on bodies to get through rooms. And at one point, um, as with we were with three or four Iraqi soldiers trying to get to the river to cut off these two isis positions and they've got a radio message saying there's a suicide bomber and a gunman running down the street towards you now.

Speaker 1:          05:06          So we stepped into this, what used to be a shop that was all blown up and smashed a bit. And I sat down as the two soldiers tried to shoot this suicide bomber as he was running towards us and someone said, IED IUD. And right next to me under the rubble was an IED. The day before, I think, or two days before to French journalists and Curtis journalists who had been killed when they stepped on an IED trying to get out and have ea Manzano, my camera man just said, you looked bored. Um, and he filmed it like we got that moment on camera and I remember just looking so bored and I couldn't give a shit about the suicide bomber, the IED. I was just bought out of my brains. And that's when I thought this is, this is not a natural reaction to, to what's going on around you right now.

Speaker 1:          05:49          What did you think your natural reaction should have been? I mean, blood rating, racing, heart rate, increasing, you know, um, vigilance, um, you know, and what did you think at the time was the cause of you being numb? Like while it was happening, I hadn't really thought that much about PTSD. I just thought it'd become so used to this. And one of the things that came up in the, in one of the last sessions I did was I didn't think I was him as important enough to get to get shot and hurt and have medics rush over to help me and maybe a helicopter take the out and, you know, um, I know that sounds ridiculous now, but I think part of me thought, yeah, you're not important enough to have something so dramatic happen to you. You're just, you're just witnessing other people in these dramas. Wow.

Speaker 1:          06:33          To be right next to an IUD and not freaking out is pretty crazy. Yeah. With a suicide bomber riding down the street towards, I mean that's, and also, you know, people, people, one of the reasons you feel guilty is you do get respect for being brave. And I would say it wasn't bravery. I wasn't scared and then did it anyway. I wasn't scared. I was just numb and just, you know, kept looking at respect from other journalists, from the soldiers. Like who are you getting respect from? Yeah. Or, or people that watched the films or, yeah. And uh, it doesn't, it doesn't feel like bravery. It just feels like you're, you know, you've, you've, you've become stupid about the risks you're taking. So talk me through this therapy. So you're fast for 24 hours, you take the Mtma and then they just start talking to you about the things that are troubling.

Speaker 1:          07:20          Yeah. So you take 125 milligrams and then when that hits about that a lot, I think it's a good dose, but then when it hits, you take another 75. So overall that, that's a good dose and that keeps you up for, you know, six, seven, eight hours. Um, and then, you know, the therapist would ask very brief question. Just, just knowing what direction to push me. And I remember the first session, I mean, I'd thought because of what I now know was PTSD, I'd thought because of the job I do and because there was this kind of darkness in there, I didn't get involved with anyone seriously for a very long time and even thought I'm not going to have a family and kids and house and dog and you know, I just just hadn't even thought about it. Just assumed that that's not for me because of the job I do.

Speaker 1:          08:04          And very early on in that first session after I resisted it for about an hour and a half, like was really resisting it for a long time and thinking it was even a placebo. Um, but, but there was this wave of relief. I've just, of course you can, of course you can have all that. And it, it felt like a revelation because I thought I, that had been close to me for so long. I know, seven, eight years, maybe longer. I just thought now that you can't do that, that's not for you or you can't put someone else through that with you. What is it particularly about MDM may, what is it about, I mean I've done it but I've only done it once. The is it just because of the fact that it just alleviates the insecurity and allows you to look at things in a more natural sense?

Speaker 1:          08:44          You look at everything as if we're just talking about having coffee or water, everything is just easy to think about on a dress and talk about. Um, and I think I'll probably explain it badly, but I think the science of it is you have five networks in your brain and, and I was basically in fight or flight mode so much that that was the only mode on you. So even when I'm back in New York, if someone walks up to close behind me, I'm expecting a confrontation. I'm in fight or flight mode all the time. So your brain is ignoring the other parts of your brain that provide context. And that say that bang outside is just the car back firing. It's not an id or someone shooting to the Mtma just allows your brain to, you know, all the parts of your brain to communicate.

Speaker 1:          09:21          Again, you're not just in that fight or flight mode. So once you get out of that fight or flight mode, you can then address things that, that you couldn't even begin to address before. And once you've had these experiences for you, it was three experiences. They're profound enough that you retain the benefits. Some, I mean it looks like I'm in the 25% that still have PTSD after the three months, but it still helped enormously. I mean, the next day they got me to sit down and do a video diary and I was kind of saying, yeah, I thought this near, this was a revelation. And I said, you know what, I'm just, I'm just smiling now in a way that I don't feel like I've smiled for years. Like it feels like my whole face is smiling and this is the next day, which is usually a little wrecked.

Speaker 1:          10:02          Yeah, I think it's two or three days when you have the, what we used to call a moody Tuesday, two or three days. Yeah. But there with this, there, there's no, there's no come down. Um, with this, it's, it's, you know, there, there, there's no downside how they give you, they give you five HTP or anything while you're, um, nothing apart from the MD may or may not. Wow. You have, you have juice, you have water throughout. Um, I mean maybe they come down is related to, you know, people that used to take it with just dance and sweat. Right. All nightly hydrate. Yeah. Yeah. Maybe. Maybe it's a Shitty Mtma maybe you just feel shit. Yeah, I mean the, yeah. The ecstasy they would've sold in London would have been the rat poison and breeze block dust and all kinds of, yeah. Um, so I know they're having very positive results with this.

Speaker 1:          10:45          And are they planning on implementing this to the public in any terror short term? I mean, is this something that like people that are listening to this right now, it's just going to be available to them fairly soon? It looks like it should be legal by 2021, 2022, the third round of officially FDA approved trials start soon. Um, that's the first one that involves people other than veterans and first responders. If that gets as good results of the first two trials, which I'm sure it will then, then I think it's going to be, and because FDA gave it breakthrough drug status, there's nothing that you know anyone can do to stop it. It will be legal by 2021 2022. That's very good news for a lot of people that are suffering. Yeah. It's so difficult for people to change perspective just to, to have a break from the normal sort of momentum of your life and to be able to stop and analyze. Yeah.
