Poly-

00:00:01.040 --> 00:00:01.220
Poly-

00:00:01.220 --> 00:00:01.920
Poly-

00:00:01.920 --> 00:00:02.866
-mer.

00:00:02.866 --> 00:00:03.813
-mer.

00:00:03.813 --> 00:00:06.000
Polymer!

What all Polymers are, are long-chain molecules.

00:00:22.650 --> 00:00:25.290 position:81%
Every polymer is some kind of a long-chain molecule.

00:00:25.290 --> 00:00:43.439
[music]

00:00:43.439 --> 00:00:49.970 position:69%
Many mers together, and now we're a polymer.

00:00:49.970 --> 00:00:55.390 position:97%
The ability to bear stress -- that makes it useful as a clothing

00:00:55.390 --> 00:00:56.500
fiber, for example.

00:00:57.570 --> 00:01:00.840 position:97%
-- Or, the ability to entangle, to give it rubbery properties, which

00:01:00.840 --> 00:01:02.730
makes it useful as your shoe sole.

00:01:02.730 --> 00:01:04.700 position:81%
All of those things come from the long-chain nature.

00:01:05.360 --> 00:01:07.940 position:95%
And so, once you begin to understand that, you begin see what

00:01:07.940 --> 00:01:09.480
makes polymers special.

00:01:09.660 --> 00:01:10.280
Poly-

00:01:10.280 --> 00:01:11.210
-mer.

00:01:11.210 --> 00:01:11.670
Poly-

00:01:11.670 --> 00:01:12.910
-mer.

Poly-

00:01:13.600 --> 00:01:14.160

Poly-

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:16.000

This is a polymeric liquid, so if you apply sheer force slowly,

00:01:33.830 --> 00:01:35.050
it will flow as a liquid.

00:01:35.050 --> 00:01:38.518 position:91%
Whereas, if you apply sheer force quickly, the chains will

00:01:38.518 --> 00:01:39.420 position:63%
entangle, and it will behave as a solid.

00:01:41.047 --> 00:01:43.740 position:61%
Rubber bands are made out of a polymer.

00:01:44.350 --> 00:01:47.080 position:88%
When it gets really cold, these chains, they can't slide

00:01:47.080 --> 00:01:48.200
past each other anymore.

00:01:48.200 --> 00:01:49.260
They're locked in place.

00:01:50.280 --> 00:01:54.030
[children exclaim]

00:01:54.280 --> 00:01:56.030
Slime!

00:01:56.030 --> 00:01:58.130
There are polymers in diapers.

00:01:58.130 --> 00:02:00.000 position:64%
The natural proteins -- DNA is a polymer.

00:02:00.310 --> 00:02:01.110
We eat polymers.

00:02:01.640 --> 00:02:03.930 position:75%
I've had Silly Putty before, which is a polymer.

00:02:03.930 --> 00:02:05.490
My favorite polymer?

00:02:05.490 --> 00:02:06.560
I will say Silly Putty.

00:02:08.022 --> 00:02:11.922 position:97%
That's what Silly Putty is. Silly Putty is a collection of polymer chains.

00:02:11.922 --> 00:02:13.385
They're tangled up.

00:02:13.385 --> 00:02:14.360
They're entangled with each other.

00:02:14.360 --> 00:02:20.700 position:83%
... A chain of molecules that are chained chemically,

00:02:20.700 --> 00:02:23.400 position:70%
and that can hold a certain amount of fluids.

00:02:24.012 --> 00:02:27.840 position:75%
A polymer is a long molecule of repeating parts.

00:02:28.370 --> 00:02:28.900
Polymer.

00:02:28.900 --> 00:02:29.430
Polymer.

00:02:29.960 --> 00:02:30.490

00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:32.930

00:02:32.930 --> 00:02:33.950
Polymer.

00:02:33.950 --> 00:02:34.410
Polymer.

00:02:35.070 --> 00:02:35.620
Polymer.

00:02:36.440 --> 00:02:36.930
Polymer.

00:02:37.420 --> 00:02:37.910
Polymer.

00:02:39.380 --> 00:02:39.870
Polymer.

00:02:39.870 --> 00:02:44.280 position:97%

00:03:10.880 --> 00:03:13.227
Poly- whoo!
