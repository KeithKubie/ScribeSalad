00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.000
In this problem, we take in a list p, and we want to return the greatest value in p.

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:06.000
We're given that the list is positive integers.

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:10.000
We're going to choose 0 to start out greatest value,

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:13.000
because 0 is smaller than any positive integer.

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:18.000
Additionally, if we're given an empty list, we're told in the instructions to return 0.

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:20.000
This will be useful later.

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:26.000
This is similar to the previous question where we want to go through the list one entry at a time.

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:31.000
If we find an entry in our list that's greater than our current running biggest,

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:34.000
then we want to update biggest.

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:37.000
At the end we're going to return our max value.

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:40.000
The problem specifically asks for you to deal with the empty list case,

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:44.000
and if you noticed, if p is empty we don't execute any of this.

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:48.000
So the end result is that this is equivalent to just returning 0,

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:51.000
which satisfies the problem constraints.
