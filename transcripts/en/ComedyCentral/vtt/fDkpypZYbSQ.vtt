00:00:04.437 --> 00:00:05.872
- So a couple people did
respond to your headshot.

00:00:05.872 --> 00:00:07.373 align:start size:84% position:16%
They asked if you
were mentally unstable

00:00:07.373 --> 00:00:08.941
but at least they responded.

00:00:08.941 --> 00:00:10.509
- Um, okay.

00:00:10.509 --> 00:00:13.045
- Right and also I have to
say your social media game

00:00:13.045 --> 00:00:15.414
sucks, Gary, big time.

00:00:15.414 --> 00:00:17.250
You need to spice it up a
little bit so more people

00:00:17.250 --> 00:00:19.552
will follow you,
it really helps.

00:00:19.552 --> 00:00:22.054
- I mean my Instagram
game is pretty tight.

00:00:22.054 --> 00:00:24.890
- Oh, interesting, does
tight mean awful now?

00:00:24.890 --> 00:00:27.560
Because let's just see
what we have here right.

00:00:27.560 --> 00:00:31.398 align:start size:94% position:6%
Food, food, food, a
bridge, a dead bird, food.

00:00:34.700 --> 00:00:37.570
Yeah, really, this
is embarrassing.

00:00:38.738 --> 00:00:39.972 align:start size:84% position:16%
Okay, that's an
embarrassing profile.

00:00:39.972 --> 00:00:41.741
- I mean a dead bird.

00:00:44.743 --> 00:00:46.646
What if I'm naked?

00:00:46.646 --> 00:00:50.383
- That's not a good idea,
not with your body type.

00:00:50.383 --> 00:00:54.054
(heavy bass, hip hop music)

00:01:00.326 --> 00:01:03.830
(electronic game music)

00:01:03.830 --> 00:01:07.566
- Ha ha ha ha, what's up
it's Gary from Gary gram.

00:01:07.566 --> 00:01:09.969 align:start size:84% position:16%
I'm chillin at my crib
with my best friend

00:01:09.969 --> 00:01:11.337
and my roommate, Rick.

00:01:11.337 --> 00:01:14.107
He's playing video
games high on weed.

00:01:14.107 --> 00:01:15.274
I'm about to get high too.

00:01:15.274 --> 00:01:17.110 align:start size:88% position:13%
Like this video ladies,
so maybe come over?

00:01:17.110 --> 00:01:18.178
I don't know.

00:01:19.679 --> 00:01:21.247
- What the hell was that?

00:01:21.247 --> 00:01:22.782 align:start size:84% position:16%
- Amy said my social
media game sucks.

00:01:22.782 --> 00:01:25.517
My Instagram's wack, I mean,
which is totally ridiculous.

00:01:25.517 --> 00:01:28.087
- I told you dude,
it fucking sucks.

00:01:28.087 --> 00:01:29.489
A dead bird?

00:01:29.489 --> 00:01:31.090
- Haha, yeah.

00:01:31.090 --> 00:01:34.094
- Let me see your
phone, I can help.

00:01:34.961 --> 00:01:37.497
- What are you doing?

00:01:37.497 --> 00:01:39.598 align:start size:94% position:6%
- Hey what's up, it's
Rick, I'm here with Gary,

00:01:39.598 --> 00:01:40.966
we're about to blow up his gram.

00:01:40.966 --> 00:01:42.202
- What?

00:01:42.202 --> 00:01:43.470
- And his face.

00:01:44.871 --> 00:01:46.539
- What the fuck man!

00:01:46.539 --> 00:01:47.540
- Now watch.

00:01:49.975 --> 00:01:52.946
(electronic music)

00:02:04.991 --> 00:02:06.225
- The video's got
over 2,000 views

00:02:06.225 --> 00:02:07.960
and I have 300 new friends.

00:02:07.960 --> 00:02:10.830 align:start size:88% position:13%
- Haha, yeah, told you,

00:02:10.830 --> 00:02:12.298
- Dude.

00:02:12.298 --> 00:02:14.066 align:start size:94% position:6%
- Now you gotta keep
going, deliver good shit.

00:02:14.066 --> 00:02:15.868
- Do I have to hurt
my body every time?

00:02:15.868 --> 00:02:17.337
- Do you want to?

00:02:18.504 --> 00:02:20.672 align:start size:84% position:16%
- No, of course not,
can't you help me

00:02:20.672 --> 00:02:23.509
without hitting me in the face?

00:02:23.509 --> 00:02:25.311
- On one condition.

00:02:25.311 --> 00:02:27.013
- Okay, what?

00:02:27.013 --> 00:02:31.150
- I get complete creative
control, no exceptions.

00:02:31.150 --> 00:02:33.052

(smooth electronic music)

00:03:21.701 --> 00:03:25.071
- Lookin good, kid, these

00:03:25.071 --> 00:03:28.607
Although my favorite is still
the one where you get slapped.

00:03:28.607 --> 00:03:31.944
Gary, this photo

00:03:31.944 --> 00:03:34.914
Woah, you're in the game now.

00:03:34.914 --> 00:03:36.114
Alright this is going

00:03:44.223 --> 00:03:46.592

00:03:46.592 --> 00:03:48.293
- All for the love

00:03:48.293 --> 00:03:50.129

00:03:50.129 --> 00:03:53.065 align:start size:97% position:3%
- Now it's time to celebrate
with a little Indonesia.

00:03:53.065 --> 00:03:56.736
- Ah, I don't think weed
goes good with cereal.

00:03:56.736 --> 00:03:57.570
Psych, oh!

00:03:59.772 --> 00:04:01.608

What is he talking about?

00:04:59.532 --> 00:05:01.134 align:start size:84% position:16%
- It's the
unforgivable sin, bro.

00:05:01.134 --> 00:05:02.735
I got a buddy who
works at Instagram,

00:05:02.735 --> 00:05:05.338

00:05:26.092 --> 00:05:28.161
Stealing, are you insane?

I had no idea that those were
other people's photographs.

00:05:33.599 --> 00:05:35.234
I had no idea.

00:05:35.234 --> 00:05:36.869 align:start size:97% position:3%

directors won't even let me

00:05:36.869 --> 00:05:39.706 align:start size:94% position:6%
submit you for background
work, Meryl Streep.

00:05:43.376 --> 00:05:46.112
Fuck, fuck, what

00:05:47.346 --> 00:05:49.048
Why did you do that?

00:05:49.048 --> 00:05:50.349 align:start size:84% position:16%
Those are other
people's photographs,

00:05:50.349 --> 00:05:51.851
why didn't you tag them?

00:05:51.851 --> 00:05:54.220
- Whatever man, those guys
are a bunch of nerds anyway.

00:05:54.220 --> 00:05:56.956
There's real problems going

(camera click)

00:06:29.255 --> 00:06:30.757
What are you doing?

00:06:30.757 --> 00:06:33.092 align:start size:94% position:6%
