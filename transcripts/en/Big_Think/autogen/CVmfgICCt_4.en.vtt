things of course and if only there were

00:00:22.800 --> 00:00:22.810
things of course and if only there were
 

00:00:22.810 --> 00:00:26.100
things of course and if only there were
more purely secular groups that provided

00:00:26.100 --> 00:00:26.110
more purely secular groups that provided
 

00:00:26.110 --> 00:00:27.840

00:00:27.840 --> 00:00:27.850
not only the good works but also the
 

00:00:27.850 --> 00:00:29.490
not only the good works but also the
community I think that would be a good

00:00:29.490 --> 00:00:29.500
community I think that would be a good
 

00:00:29.500 --> 00:00:33.330
community I think that would be a good
thing I've been talking with various

00:00:33.330 --> 00:00:33.340
thing I've been talking with various
 

00:00:33.340 --> 00:00:36.600
thing I've been talking with various
people about the need to provide that

00:00:36.600 --> 00:00:36.610
people about the need to provide that
 

00:00:36.610 --> 00:00:40.229
people about the need to provide that
structure in secular organizations and I

00:00:40.229 --> 00:00:40.239
structure in secular organizations and I
 

00:00:40.239 --> 00:00:41.970
structure in secular organizations and I
think it's possible and I think we

00:00:41.970 --> 00:00:41.980
think it's possible and I think we
 

00:00:41.980 --> 00:00:43.950
think it's possible and I think we
should work at it because you're

00:00:43.950 --> 00:00:43.960
should work at it because you're
 

00:00:43.960 --> 00:00:47.190
should work at it because you're
absolutely right people sometimes when

00:00:47.190 --> 00:00:47.200
absolutely right people sometimes when
 

00:00:47.200 --> 00:00:49.319
absolutely right people sometimes when
there's nobody around to love you and

00:00:49.319 --> 00:00:49.329
there's nobody around to love you and
 

00:00:49.329 --> 00:00:50.729
there's nobody around to love you and
take care of you it's great to have a

00:00:50.729 --> 00:00:50.739
take care of you it's great to have a
 

00:00:50.739 --> 00:00:55.819
take care of you it's great to have a
group that you can be welcomed into

00:00:55.819 --> 00:00:55.829
 

00:00:55.829 --> 00:00:58.189
well I suppose the the simplest answer

00:00:58.189 --> 00:00:58.199
well I suppose the the simplest answer
 

00:00:58.199 --> 00:01:00.590
well I suppose the the simplest answer
is it would be good if there were and

00:01:00.590 --> 00:01:00.600
is it would be good if there were and
 

00:01:00.600 --> 00:01:04.189
is it would be good if there were and
there are already the churches without

00:01:04.189 --> 00:01:04.199
there are already the churches without
 

00:01:04.199 --> 00:01:08.539
there are already the churches without
dogmas and in fact more and more

00:01:08.539 --> 00:01:08.549
dogmas and in fact more and more
 

00:01:08.549 --> 00:01:12.560
dogmas and in fact more and more
churches downplay a Dogma to the point

00:01:12.560 --> 00:01:12.570
churches downplay a Dogma to the point
 

00:01:12.570 --> 00:01:16.070
churches downplay a Dogma to the point
of evaporation and concentrate on

00:01:16.070 --> 00:01:16.080
of evaporation and concentrate on
 

00:01:16.080 --> 00:01:20.420
of evaporation and concentrate on
providing just the sort of a community

00:01:20.420 --> 00:01:20.430
providing just the sort of a community
 

00:01:20.430 --> 00:01:24.499
providing just the sort of a community
of care mutual care and and helping the

00:01:24.499 --> 00:01:24.509
of care mutual care and and helping the
 

00:01:24.509 --> 00:01:27.020
of care mutual care and and helping the
world and so I think it's entirely

00:01:27.020 --> 00:01:27.030
world and so I think it's entirely
 

00:01:27.030 --> 00:01:30.919
world and so I think it's entirely
possible the churches will evolve into

00:01:30.919 --> 00:01:30.929
possible the churches will evolve into
 

00:01:30.929 --> 00:01:33.620
possible the churches will evolve into
sort of Creed 'less organizations that

00:01:33.620 --> 00:01:33.630
sort of Creed 'less organizations that
 

00:01:33.630 --> 00:01:36.109
sort of Creed 'less organizations that
do a lot of good work and that would be

00:01:36.109 --> 00:01:36.119
do a lot of good work and that would be
 

00:01:36.119 --> 00:01:38.299
do a lot of good work and that would be
wonderful
