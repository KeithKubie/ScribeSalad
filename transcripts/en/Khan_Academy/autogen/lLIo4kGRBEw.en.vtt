00:00:00.620 --> 00:00:04.400
 Let's solve a few tasks that contain fractions. 

00:00:04.400 --> 00:00:07.560
 Instead of fractions, we can actually say "rational numbers." 

00:00:07.560 --> 00:00:08.700
 Whatever. 

00:00:08.710 --> 00:00:11.390
 I will solve each of these examples here above. 

00:00:11.390 --> 00:00:14.110
 Let's start with (b). 

00:00:14.110 --> 00:00:18.540
 We have 2/3 minus 1/4. 

00:00:18.540 --> 00:00:21.220
 As with fractions, we need to bring it 

00:00:21.220 --> 00:00:22.890
 to a common denominator here. 

00:00:22.890 --> 00:00:24.960
 We need to know how many parts 

00:00:24.960 --> 00:00:26.200
 of all we work. 

00:00:26.200 --> 00:00:29.320
 We look for a common denominator at 3 and 4, or at least 

00:00:29.320 --> 00:00:32.020
 total fold of 3 and 4. The smallest number, 

00:00:32.020 --> 00:00:35.180
 which is divided into both is 12. 

00:00:35.180 --> 00:00:37.240
 Let me write it this way. 

00:00:37.240 --> 00:00:38.320
 Let me do it this way. 

00:00:38.320 --> 00:00:39.310
 That would be more interesting. 

00:00:39.310 --> 00:00:46.390
 For 2/3 we record 12 in denominator. 3 in 4 equals 12, 

00:00:46.390 --> 00:00:49.680
 and 2 in 4 equals 8. 

00:00:49.680 --> 00:00:51.230
 These two fractions are equivalent. 

00:00:51.230 --> 00:00:54.330
 We multiplied the numerator and the denominator by 4. 

00:00:54.330 --> 00:00:58.520
 For 1/4, if we get 12 in a denominator, 

00:00:58.520 --> 00:01:01.310
 then 4 by 3 equals 12, 

00:01:01.310 --> 00:01:04.080
 then 1 in 3 is equal to 3. 

00:01:04.080 --> 00:01:06.400
 3/12 and 1/4 are the same thing. 

00:01:06.400 --> 00:01:08.700
 And here we have a minus sign. 

00:01:08.700 --> 00:01:12.710
 This will be equal to 8 minus 3 on 12, 

00:01:12.710 --> 00:01:14.660
 which is the common denominator, 

00:01:14.660 --> 00:01:18.450
 and this is equal to 5/12. 

00:01:18.450 --> 00:01:23.960
 Let us now decide (d). 

00:01:23.960 --> 00:01:25.740
 Let me write it in a different color. 

00:01:27.680 --> 00:01:34.980
 15/11 minus 9/7. 

00:01:34.980 --> 00:01:38.140
 Let us turn to a common denominator. 

00:01:38.140 --> 00:01:40.810
 We are looking for a multiple of 11 and 7. I think it will be 77. 

00:01:40.810 --> 00:01:42.380
 This is the first and least number, 

00:01:42.380 --> 00:01:43.560
 which is shared by both. 

00:01:43.560 --> 00:01:45.080
 We simply multiply the two numbers. 

00:01:45.080 --> 00:01:47.170
 We get 77. 

00:01:47.170 --> 00:01:51.390
 To get from 11 to 77, we should multiply it by 7. 

00:01:51.390 --> 00:01:57.230
 15 by 7 is equal to 70 plus 35. 

00:01:57.230 --> 00:02:01.000
 This is equal to 105. 

00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:04.930
 Then we record minus. 77 is a denominator. 

00:02:04.930 --> 00:02:07.400
 7 by 11 equals 77. 

00:02:07.400 --> 00:02:11.730
 9 by 11 equals 99. 

00:02:11.730 --> 00:02:18.170
 Then you get 105 minus 99 on 77. 

00:02:18.170 --> 00:02:19.840
 How much is 105 minus 99? 

00:02:19.840 --> 00:02:23.620
 It's equal to 6. And we're ready. 

00:02:23.620 --> 00:02:25.040
 We can not simplify this liver anymore. 

00:02:25.040 --> 00:02:29.390
 6 and 77 do not have common multipliers. 

00:02:29.390 --> 00:02:33.220
 Let's solve (f). 

00:02:33.220 --> 00:02:36.470
 Let's have a new color. 

00:02:36.470 --> 00:02:46.640
 (f) states that we have 7/27 minus 9/39. 

00:02:46.640 --> 00:02:51.200
 Okay, what is the common denominator equal here? 

00:02:51.200 --> 00:02:52.480
 Actually here we have 

00:02:52.480 --> 00:02:54.440
 an opportunity to simplify fractions. 

00:02:54.440 --> 00:02:57.460
 We can make them a little easier. 

00:02:57.460 --> 00:03:00.170
 At 9/39, both numbers are divided by 3. 

00:03:00.170 --> 00:03:06.220
 I can record 9/39 here. 9 divided by 3 equals 3. 

00:03:06.220 --> 00:03:10.290
 39 divided by 3 equals 13. 

00:03:10.290 --> 00:03:15.360
 Then this expression becomes equal to 7/27 minus 3/13. 

00:03:15.360 --> 00:03:18.850
 What is the common denominator for numbers 27 and 13? 

00:03:18.850 --> 00:03:20.650
 They have no common dividers and therefore 

00:03:20.650 --> 00:03:22.330
 we will simply multiply the two numbers. 

00:03:22.330 --> 00:03:25.290
 We have 27 at 13. Let me write it down 

00:03:25.290 --> 00:03:26.840
 on this side here. 

00:03:26.840 --> 00:03:30.680
 We are looking for 27 at 13. 

00:03:30.690 --> 00:03:37.370
 3 at 7 is 21. 1 and 2 in mind. 3 in 2 is 6, plus 2, is equal to 8. 

00:03:37.370 --> 00:03:38.660
 Let's put 0 here. 

00:03:38.660 --> 00:03:40.160
 1 in 7 is equal to 7. 

00:03:40.160 --> 00:03:42.600
 1 in 2 equals 2. 

00:03:42.600 --> 00:03:44.000
 Now we collect them. 

00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:45.210
 1 plus 0 is 1. 

00:03:45.210 --> 00:03:49.650
 8 plus 7 is 15. 

00:03:49.650 --> 00:03:52.170
 1 plus 2 is 3. 

00:03:52.170 --> 00:03:57.160
 We have something on the common denominator 

00:03:57.160 --> 00:04:00.560
 minus another thing on 351. 

00:04:00.560 --> 00:04:05.480
 To get 351 out of 27, we should multiply it by 13. 

00:04:05.480 --> 00:04:08.422
 To get from 7 to the numerator here, 

00:04:08.422 --> 00:04:09.960
 we should multiply it by 13. 

00:04:09.960 --> 00:04:15.020
 7 at 13 is equal to 70 plus 21, i. E. 91. 

00:04:15.020 --> 00:04:17.300
 This liver becomes 91/351. 

00:04:17.310 --> 00:04:23.650
 To get 351 out of 13, we should multiply it by 27. 

00:04:23.650 --> 00:04:26.810
 We multiply the numerator by 27. 

00:04:26.810 --> 00:04:33.140
 3 at 27, which is 60 plus 21, i. E. 81. 

00:04:33.140 --> 00:04:39.830
 The answer will contain a denominator 351. 

00:04:39.830 --> 00:04:43.550
 91 minus 81 is equal to 10. 

00:04:43.550 --> 00:04:45.230
 And we're ready. 

00:04:45.230 --> 00:04:46.960
 Let's figure out another example. 

00:04:46.960 --> 00:04:48.840
 These become a bit more difficult, 

00:04:48.840 --> 00:04:50.460
 but we can deal with them. 

00:04:50.470 --> 00:05:02.380
 (h) states 13/64 minus 7/40. 

00:05:02.380 --> 00:05:06.980
 Let's look for a common denominator of 64 and 40. 

00:05:06.980 --> 00:05:09.380
 80 will not happen. 

00:05:09.380 --> 00:05:12.360
 We may try another. Let's actually try 

00:05:12.360 --> 00:05:13.520
 in the traditional way. 

00:05:13.520 --> 00:05:14.980
 Let's look at the multipliers. 

00:05:14.990 --> 00:05:18.655
 Let's divide the two numbers into simple multipliers 

00:05:18.660 --> 00:05:20.820
 and find the smallest total number. 

00:05:20.820 --> 00:05:22.080
 This will be interesting. 

00:05:22.080 --> 00:05:29.780
 Let me write 64 with another color. 

00:05:29.780 --> 00:05:34.340
 We can divide it into 2 by 32, which is the same as 

00:05:34.340 --> 00:05:40.260
 2 at 16, and 16 equals 2 at 8. 

00:05:40.260 --> 00:05:43.030
 8 is the same as 2 in 4, and 4 is the same 

00:05:43.030 --> 00:05:48.410
 such as 2 in 2. 

00:05:48.410 --> 00:05:51.300
 We multiply two by one 

00:05:51.300 --> 00:05:54.500
 three, four, five, six times. 

00:05:54.500 --> 00:05:59.250
 It is obtained that 64 equals 2 in 2, 2, 

00:05:59.250 --> 00:06:01.560
 2, 2, 2. 

00:06:01.560 --> 00:06:03.200
 If you know what the degrees are, then it's the same 

00:06:03.200 --> 00:06:04.700
 like having 2 at sixth. 

00:06:04.700 --> 00:06:06.340
 That's for 64. 

00:06:06.340 --> 00:06:09.730
 For 40 we will apply the same thing. 

00:06:09.730 --> 00:06:13.690
 Let me write 40 with a different color. 

00:06:13.690 --> 00:06:22.560
 40 is equal to 2 by 20, which is equal to 2 by 10 and 10 by 2 by 5. 

00:06:22.560 --> 00:06:28.480
 We get that 40 is equal to 2 by 2, by 2, by 5. 

00:06:28.480 --> 00:06:31.220
 So we decompose 40 to simple multipliers. 

00:06:31.220 --> 00:06:36.280
 Now, if we compare the two numbers, then 2 by 2, 2 

00:06:36.280 --> 00:06:39.180
 is also contained in 64. 

00:06:39.180 --> 00:06:41.240
 We notice that there is no multiplier 5 

00:06:41.240 --> 00:06:43.260
 in the simple multipliers of 64. 

00:06:43.260 --> 00:06:45.230
 We have 2 2, 2. 

00:06:45.230 --> 00:06:49.680
 To find the smallest common fold, here are these simple multipliers 

00:06:49.680 --> 00:06:52.100
 simply multiply them by 5. 

00:06:52.100 --> 00:06:55.740
 We take 64 and multiply it by 5. 

00:06:55.740 --> 00:07:01.670
 Then there is 64 in the resulting number, but also 

00:07:01.670 --> 00:07:04.470
 also contains the number 40. 

00:07:04.470 --> 00:07:06.980
 That is, it's 64 at 5. 

00:07:06.980 --> 00:07:13.100
 What is the equivalent of 64 in 5? 

00:07:13.180 --> 00:07:14.900
 It ends my place here. 

00:07:14.900 --> 00:07:17.060
 I will move to the right. 

00:07:17.060 --> 00:07:21.920
 64 by 5 equals 320. 

00:07:22.980 --> 00:07:28.760
 We have 320 after multiplying by 5. 

00:07:28.760 --> 00:07:30.660
 If we multiply 64 by 5, 

00:07:30.660 --> 00:07:32.280
 we should multiply by 13 by 5. 

00:07:32.280 --> 00:07:36.380
 This is equal to 50 plus 15. 

00:07:36.380 --> 00:07:42.070
 13 by 5 is equal to 65. 

00:07:42.070 --> 00:07:50.050
 Then, to reach from 40 to 320, we should multiply it by 8. 

00:07:50.050 --> 00:07:51.680
 We see it here in decomposition. 

00:07:51.680 --> 00:07:53.870
 We have these three pairs, ie. 2 of third grade. 

00:07:53.870 --> 00:07:56.730
 Then we multiply by 8 and we record here. 

00:07:56.730 --> 00:08:02.350
 7 by 8 equals 56. 

00:08:02.350 --> 00:08:14.160
 It is obtained that we have 65 minus 56, which equals 9. 

00:08:15.940 --> 00:08:18.600
 That is 9/320. 

00:08:18.600 --> 00:08:20.280
 It was a tough task, but we succeeded 

00:08:20.280 --> 00:08:21.580
 to go through it. 

00:08:21.580 --> 00:08:26.400
 Let's solve this last task here below. 

00:08:26.400 --> 00:08:29.720
 Consider the 2/3 equation by x plus 1/2. 

00:08:29.720 --> 00:08:34.770
 Well, y is equal to 2/3 of x plus 1/2. 

00:08:34.770 --> 00:08:37.880
 Determine the change in y between x is equal to 1 

00:08:37.880 --> 00:08:39.330
 and x is equal to 2. 

00:08:39.330 --> 00:08:40.340
 All right. 

00:08:40.340 --> 00:08:44.630
 Let us draw a small table with x and y. 

00:08:44.630 --> 00:08:46.950
 For x equal to 1, what is equal to y? 

00:08:46.950 --> 00:08:52.540
 We have 2/3 of 1 plus 1/2, which is equal 

00:08:52.540 --> 00:08:58.040
 2/3 plus 1/2. The common denominator is 6. 

00:08:58.040 --> 00:09:05.680
 2/3 is equal to 4/6 - after multiplying the liver by 2 - plus 1/2 or 3/6. 

00:09:05.680 --> 00:09:08.900
 This is equal to 7/6. 

00:09:09.800 --> 00:09:10.580
 All right. 

00:09:10.580 --> 00:09:12.880
 Replace with x equal to 2. 

00:09:12.880 --> 00:09:19.880
 Two thirds of 2 plus 1/2 are obtained, 

00:09:19.880 --> 00:09:26.470
 which is equal to 4/3 plus 1/2. 

00:09:26.470 --> 00:09:28.290
 The common denominator is again 6. 

00:09:28.290 --> 00:09:35.620
 4/3 is equal to 8/6 after the liver is multiplied by 2. 

00:09:35.620 --> 00:09:39.570
 Add 3/6 and get 11/6. 

00:09:39.570 --> 00:09:43.030
 They want us to determine the change for y between x is equal to 1 

00:09:43.030 --> 00:09:44.260
 and x is equal to 2. 

00:09:44.260 --> 00:09:47.330
 That is, how bigger is this value for y, 

00:09:47.330 --> 00:09:50.260
 when x is equal to 2, relative to this value, at x is equal to 1? 

00:09:50.260 --> 00:10:00.680
 We compile the difference 11/6 minus 7/6 to find the change for y 

00:10:00.690 --> 00:10:06.440
 between x is equal to 1 and x is equal to 2. 11 minus 7 equals 4, 

00:10:06.440 --> 00:10:09.570
 on 6, which is equal to 2/3. 

00:10:09.570 --> 00:10:12.800
 This answer makes sense because every time, 

00:10:12.800 --> 00:10:16.100
 when x increases by 1, the expression for y 

00:10:16.100 --> 00:10:17.700
 increases by another 2/3. 

00:10:17.700 --> 00:10:21.320
 Reaching from x equal to 1 to x equal to 2, y increases by 2/3.
