00:19:14.210 --> 00:19:14.220 align:start position:0%
enough and that's the direction it very
 

00:19:14.220 --> 00:19:16.340 align:start position:0%
enough and that's the direction it very
naturally<00:19:14.820><c> annoyingly</c><00:19:15.270><c> takes</c><00:19:15.660><c> it</c><00:19:15.840><c> there</c><00:19:16.050><c> it</c>

00:19:16.340 --> 00:19:16.350 align:start position:0%
naturally annoyingly takes it there it
 

00:19:16.350 --> 00:19:20.540 align:start position:0%
naturally annoyingly takes it there it
works<00:19:16.950><c> if</c><00:19:17.310><c> it's</c><00:19:17.930><c> just</c><00:19:18.930><c> dark</c><00:19:19.230><c> just</c><00:19:19.770><c> mean</c><00:19:20.040><c> and</c><00:19:20.370><c> it</c>

00:19:20.540 --> 00:19:20.550 align:start position:0%
works if it's just dark just mean and it
 

00:19:20.550 --> 00:19:24.080 align:start position:0%
works if it's just dark just mean and it
hasn't<00:19:20.940><c> earned</c><00:19:21.330><c> it</c><00:19:21.690><c> then</c><00:19:22.170><c> there's</c><00:19:22.950><c> it's</c><00:19:23.850><c> just</c>

00:19:24.080 --> 00:19:24.090 align:start position:0%
hasn't earned it then there's it's just
 

00:19:24.090 --> 00:19:25.910 align:start position:0%
hasn't earned it then there's it's just
exactly<00:19:24.390><c> that</c><00:19:24.750><c> it</c><00:19:24.900><c> hasn't</c><00:19:25.080><c> earned</c><00:19:25.290><c> it</c><00:19:25.590><c> I</c><00:19:25.740><c> think</c>

00:19:25.910 --> 00:19:25.920 align:start position:0%
exactly that it hasn't earned it I think
 

00:19:25.920 --> 00:19:27.170 align:start position:0%
exactly that it hasn't earned it I think
a<00:19:26.070><c> change</c><00:19:26.220><c> your</c><00:19:26.400><c> time</c><00:19:26.520><c> to</c><00:19:26.610><c> think</c><00:19:26.700><c> very</c><00:19:26.850><c> much</c><00:19:27.060><c> is</c>

00:19:27.170 --> 00:19:27.180 align:start position:0%
