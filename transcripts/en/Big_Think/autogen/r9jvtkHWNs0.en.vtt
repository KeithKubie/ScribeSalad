about themselves and their future if you
 

00:02:45.909 --> 00:02:48.149
about themselves and their future if you
don't provide those basic elements of I

00:02:48.149 --> 00:02:48.159
don't provide those basic elements of I
 

00:02:48.159 --> 00:02:50.610

math and with the humanities they're not
they're not going to get there anyway

00:03:05.789 --> 00:03:05.799
they're not going to get there anyway

shrouds is that creating the individual
 

00:03:16.329 --> 00:03:19.740
shrouds is that creating the individual
is a project it takes a lot of work to

00:03:19.740 --> 00:03:19.750
is a project it takes a lot of work to
 

00:03:19.750 --> 00:03:21.990
is a project it takes a lot of work to
create an individual I mean we want to

go thoughtfully into that ballot box
 

00:03:27.430 --> 00:03:30.809
go thoughtfully into that ballot box
right but that's a project we're not

00:03:30.809 --> 00:03:30.819
right but that's a project we're not
 

00:03:30.819 --> 00:03:33.330
right but that's a project we're not
born that way right I mean as a father I

00:03:33.330 --> 00:03:33.340
born that way right I mean as a father I
 

00:03:33.340 --> 00:03:35.189
