00:00:01.030 --> 00:00:05.200
 Belts around the world have never dreamed of it, and the keyboard is growing. 

00:00:04.450 --> 00:00:08.590
 There is not 

00:00:05.200 --> 00:00:13.300
 You guys too. 

00:00:08.590 --> 00:00:16.830
 I am the best today. 

00:00:13.300 --> 00:00:16.830
 I want to tell you how to make a lot of money. 

00:00:17.529 --> 00:00:22.749
 Mobile app developers are dreaming of a big hit today 

00:00:21.189 --> 00:00:25.929
 We are burning. 

00:00:22.749 --> 00:00:30.460
 How do you want to earn more money? 

00:00:25.929 --> 00:00:33.760
 Hello, I am running today. 

00:00:30.460 --> 00:00:37.570
 I'll show you how to make a lot of revenue. 

00:00:33.760 --> 00:00:42.070
 There are two general ways a mobile app can make money. 

00:00:37.570 --> 00:00:46.329
 Selling apps in your app and exposing 909 photos. 

00:00:42.070 --> 00:00:51.850
 Korean developers often think that the sales revenue of the item is the most. 

00:00:46.329 --> 00:00:57.190
 According to external statistics such as the actual idc, m 4 

00:00:51.850 --> 00:01:01.420
 Item sales of cabbage m 4 advertising sales account for about 5 percent 

00:00:57.190 --> 00:01:04.809
 So you can advertise either, so in Admob these two 

00:01:01.420 --> 00:01:08.799
 We have released 8 rabbit items. 

00:01:04.809 --> 00:01:10.240
 If you use item sales buildings, users who are likely to pay for ad mob 

00:01:08.799 --> 00:01:14.350
 I want you to pick an automatic. 

00:01:10.240 --> 00:01:18.970
 Then they show me all the same things that stimulate your purchase. 

00:01:14.350 --> 00:01:23.649
 For the rest of the users, you can show the ad mob ads on the same spot. 

00:01:18.970 --> 00:01:27.759
 Targeted sexual ads have a high nodule, which leads to an increase in sales of items. 

00:01:23.649 --> 00:01:30.430
 At the same time, you'll also get ad revenue. 

00:01:27.759 --> 00:01:34.390
 The announcement will never be separated. 

00:01:30.430 --> 00:01:36.100
 So let's see how this article maneuver works in ad mob 

00:01:34.390 --> 00:01:39.759
 I'll tell you. 

00:01:36.100 --> 00:01:43.600
 The item sales department utilizes the ad mob house advertising function. 

00:01:39.759 --> 00:01:48.759
 You can think of advertising my items free of charge in Nap 

00:01:43.600 --> 00:01:52.990
 So n 4 Create an interstitial at the right place. 

00:01:48.759 --> 00:01:54.490

 Please set me up. 

00:01:54.490 --> 00:01:59.469
 So if you're targeting only those people who will automatically pay for that ad, 

00:01:58.630 --> 00:02:03.549
 See 

00:01:59.469 --> 00:02:04.899
 Maximize your profits by showing ad mob ads to other users 

00:02:03.549 --> 00:02:07.600
 It's possible 

00:02:04.899 --> 00:02:11.860
 I do not want to be rich by using it quickly. 

00:02:07.600 --> 00:02:14.270
 So let's use it once. Let's set it up first. 

00:02:11.860 --> 00:02:18.290
 Please visit the add-on main page 

00:02:14.270 --> 00:02:21.250

00:03:02.320 --> 00:03:08.020

00:03:03.640 --> 00:03:11.410
 So this is all set up for the sale of the item. 

00:03:08.020 --> 00:03:14.410

00:03:11.410 --> 00:03:17.709
 You can increase your advertising revenue all at once. 

00:03:14.410 --> 00:03:21.310
 Let's have an Android specialist who can help you apply the code. 

00:03:17.709 --> 00:03:25.390
 Teacher, please. 

00:03:21.310 --> 00:03:30.070
 Did you hear the story of Choi Si-young, manager of WoA item sales advertisement? 

00:03:25.390 --> 00:03:31.690
 With just a few clicks you can use both item sales and ad mob ads. 

00:03:30.070 --> 00:03:35.950
 It is so wonderful 

00:03:31.690 --> 00:03:36.940
 I have to apply my ship, too. Hi. 

00:03:35.950 --> 00:03:40.959
 Yes. 

00:03:36.940 --> 00:03:45.790
 All developers who are wondering how to get more 

00:03:40.959 --> 00:03:46.900
 We'll show you how to apply an item sales ad to your app. 

00:03:45.790 --> 00:03:50.230
 I will give you. 

00:03:46.900 --> 00:03:54.310
 Applying item sales ads is not difficult 

00:03:50.230 --> 00:03:58.420
 In particular, if you are already using a full-blown ad, 

00:03:54.310 --> 00:03:59.739
 A few weeks of modifying and implementing a callback function can be applied quickly 

00:03:58.420 --> 00:04:04.690
 There is 

00:03:59.739 --> 00:04:08.980
 But it seems simple, but the item sale advertising is various Google mobile service Google 

00:04:04.690 --> 00:04:13.420
 Play Ad is something that is implemented in the language utilizing the jacks feature 

00:04:08.980 --> 00:04:18.640
 As such, developers can create or connect accounts for each service. 

00:04:13.420 --> 00:04:23.530
 You need to keep the keys and settings for each service. 

00:04:18.640 --> 00:04:25.690
 There is a detailed help page for each product in Korean. 

00:04:23.530 --> 00:04:30.099
 It would be helpful if you look at it. 

00:04:25.690 --> 00:04:31.150
 So, how do you use these products in actual Android code? 

00:04:30.099 --> 00:04:31.420
 Should I 

00:04:31.150 --> 00:04:35.200
 4 

00:04:31.420 --> 00:04:37.780
 Your friend Google Play for using Google's mobile services in 

00:04:35.200 --> 00:04:41.230
 You can use this service easily 

00:04:37.780 --> 00:04:45.340
 Item Miners are included with Google Play Services 5.0 or higher 

00:04:41.230 --> 00:04:49.420
 You can add dependencies for those files as follows: 

00:04:45.340 --> 00:04:53.260
 Next we will add activities for occupancy and item sales ads 

00:04:49.420 --> 00:04:57.700
 Since the activities are already included in the Google Play service, 

00:04:53.260 --> 00:05:02.020
 You can add a manifest simply by applying the theme as follows 

00:04:57.700 --> 00:05:04.690
 And the wrong thing to buy internet items for bringing up ads 

00:05:02.020 --> 00:05:07.510
 Add to master 

00:05:04.690 --> 00:05:11.290
 Now is the time to write the code. 

00:05:07.510 --> 00:05:16.120
 I'll load the actual ad and display it on the screen. 

00:05:11.290 --> 00:05:20.260
 Let's talk about how it should be structured. 

00:05:16.120 --> 00:05:21.910
 Create a WinTest well object for display and add the ad unit 

00:05:20.260 --> 00:05:26.050
 Assign an id 

00:05:21.910 --> 00:05:27.520
 Next, the kids use the cast d to use the l2 cast 

00:05:26.050 --> 00:05:30.640
 Generate baggage 

00:05:27.520 --> 00:05:33.760
 Previously there's been a Tishire Lord Ed to derive men's 

00:05:30.640 --> 00:05:37.990
 I get one ad from the ad network 

00:05:33.760 --> 00:05:40.240
 One ad requires the requested network connection, and before and during the ad 

00:05:37.990 --> 00:05:44.950
 It may take some time 

00:05:40.240 --> 00:05:49.210
 Thus, at a specific point in time, for example, immediately after a user clears the stage, 

00:05:44.950 --> 00:05:51.400
 Show and request ad via loadhead method a little early if it is 10 o'clock 

00:05:49.210 --> 00:05:53.800
 I think you'd better do it. 

00:05:51.400 --> 00:05:57.730
 I'm finally ready to show my ad 

00:05:53.800 --> 00:05:58.630
 Watching a winter gesture can invoke methods to display an interstitial page. 

00:05:57.730 --> 00:06:02.950
 There is 

00:05:58.630 --> 00:06:05.410
 At this time, to confirm whether the advertisement was normal, the 3rd of Izu rhythm 

00:06:02.950 --> 00:06:09.790
 Please check the result. 

00:06:05.410 --> 00:06:14.830
 Also, before the ads are displayed, if they register their stuff, they will be loaded with ads 

00:06:09.790 --> 00:06:19.630
 The callback function will be called at the moment it appears on the screen or closes the ad window 

00:06:14.830 --> 00:06:22.090
 You can use it to keep your app running while ads are showing. 

00:06:19.630 --> 00:06:26.050
 You can perform tasks 

00:06:22.090 --> 00:06:27.520
 Now, when a user who is likely to buy an item launches an app, 

00:06:26.050 --> 00:06:31.210
 You will see the ad 

00:06:27.520 --> 00:06:32.050
 If this user buys an item through an ad, it should be handled appropriately within m. 

00:06:31.210 --> 00:06:36.070
 That's it. 

00:06:32.050 --> 00:06:39.160
 If you register your PlayStation to express your listener, 

00:06:36.070 --> 00:06:43.390
 When you're done, you can see and handle it 

00:06:39.160 --> 00:06:47.350
 PlayStore Persistence Listener supports two callback methods 

00:06:43.390 --> 00:06:52.090
 First of all, within the Izbeliad Perchature School bag, 

00:06:47.350 --> 00:06:56.770
 I can really check the correct lighting, and my odd pulse train callback 

00:06:52.090 --> 00:06:59.320
 Inside the game, we will properly reflect the purchased items in the game and use the pc plus method 

00:06:56.770 --> 00:07:03.340
 You can consume items through 

00:06:59.320 --> 00:07:07.180
 The arguments of the surname delivered in Nepal call speech callback include intent 

00:07:03.340 --> 00:07:11.890
 Because we have a government that can verify that the purchase process went right. 

00:07:07.180 --> 00:07:16.660
 I hope you will take advantage of this. Like this PlayStore Perth Listener 

00:07:11.890 --> 00:07:17.800
 If you register for the implementation, you will be able to process the entire item purchase process with just a few lines of code. 

00:07:16.660 --> 00:07:22.149
 can 

00:07:17.800 --> 00:07:26.499
 However, in order to verify the purchase process of items in your m 

00:07:22.149 --> 00:07:28.989
 If you are thinking of complicated tasks such as work, playstore Perth 

00:07:26.499 --> 00:07:33.399
 May be difficult to use 

00:07:28.989 --> 00:07:35.439
 In this case, there is another offer provided by the item sales ad, 

00:07:33.399 --> 00:07:39.489
 You can take advantage of you 

00:07:35.439 --> 00:07:41.259
 The Perth listener is called when the user presses the Buy Item button. 

00:07:39.489 --> 00:07:45.519
 It is a simple listener. 

00:07:41.259 --> 00:07:50.110
 PlayStorePotz Unlike in Switzerland, the developer is within the callback 

00:07:45.519 --> 00:07:52.419
 You can do all the steps involved in purchasing items, such as running an item purchase activity 

00:07:50.110 --> 00:07:56.649
 You can process 

00:07:52.419 --> 00:07:57.939
 So far, you have to be brief about how you can 

00:07:56.649 --> 00:08:01.449
 I checked. 

00:07:57.939 --> 00:08:06.009
 Learn more about this on our developer site 

00:08:01.449 --> 00:08:09.639
 Please refer to the developer blog, 

00:08:06.009 --> 00:08:14.559
 There is a way to measure and efficiently set the target user 

00:08:09.639 --> 00:08:18.669
 Another video is ready, please do not miss it 

00:08:14.559 --> 00:08:22.919
 I hope that you will earn more revenue through the sale of items. 

00:08:18.669 --> 00:08:22.919
 I'll see you later on the video. Thank you.
