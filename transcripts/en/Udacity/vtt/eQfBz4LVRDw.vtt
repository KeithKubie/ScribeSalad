00:00:00.200 --> 00:00:02.550
Okay, so let's look at the different
components of an email.

00:00:02.550 --> 00:00:05.070
First we have our subject line,
this should be short and

00:00:05.070 --> 00:00:06.310
draw attention to your email.

00:00:06.310 --> 00:00:10.760
You're trying to engage the customer
enough that they want to open the email.

00:00:10.760 --> 00:00:13.750
This is setting the expectation for
the contents of the email.

00:00:13.750 --> 00:00:16.129
If you're promoting a new feature,
say something like that.

00:00:16.129 --> 00:00:19.300
If you're telling everyone
that things are going on sale,

00:00:19.300 --> 00:00:20.880
probably should mention it there.

00:00:20.880 --> 00:00:24.320
Next we have the content, the content
is the main piece of the email.

00:00:24.320 --> 00:00:27.300
It's likely to contain some
combination of text and

00:00:27.300 --> 00:00:29.660
images depending on your chosen layout.

00:00:29.660 --> 00:00:32.490
You're going to want to
find the right layout and

00:00:32.490 --> 00:00:36.430
the right type of content to achieve
your goals for each particular email,

00:00:36.430 --> 00:00:38.930
and this is where your
messaging is showcased.

00:00:38.930 --> 00:00:40.920
So be sure to use a consistent tone.

00:00:40.920 --> 00:00:42.720
Then we have our call to action.

00:00:42.720 --> 00:00:45.060
This should mirror
the goal of the email.

00:00:45.060 --> 00:00:49.150
All of your email components should lead
to this call to action that you want

00:00:49.150 --> 00:00:50.520
your readers to take.

00:00:50.520 --> 00:00:53.020
So what is it that you really
want your readers to do, or

00:00:53.020 --> 00:00:54.710
to get out of this email?

00:00:54.710 --> 00:00:58.150
We have the from name so
who is this email from?

00:00:58.150 --> 00:01:02.313
Is it Ebarkment support, or
is it the Ebarkment team, or

00:01:02.313 --> 00:01:05.330
is it Lauren the Ebarkment COO?

00:01:05.330 --> 00:01:07.910
What do you think is going to
connect with you users, and

00:01:07.910 --> 00:01:10.120
what supports the goal of the email?

00:01:10.120 --> 00:01:14.550
For example, if this is an email about
a new feature or business channel we're

00:01:14.550 --> 00:01:20.120
going into, maybe the email should come
from the CEO or the director of product.

00:01:20.120 --> 00:01:24.050
If it's about some type of customer
support, maybe it should come from

00:01:24.050 --> 00:01:27.360
the support team, or
a particular member at the support team.

00:01:27.360 --> 00:01:29.050
And finally, the from address.

00:01:29.050 --> 00:01:31.870
This is the email that's displayed
to the receiver when they

00:01:31.870 --> 00:01:33.050
receive the email.

00:01:33.050 --> 00:01:35.430
You'll want to send your emails
from a consistent address,

00:01:35.430 --> 00:01:37.480
that aligns with
the purpose of the email.

00:01:37.480 --> 00:01:40.830
Before you choose your from address,
make sure to take into account the goals

00:01:40.830 --> 00:01:43.710
of the email, and the general tone,
you're trying to set.

00:01:43.710 --> 00:01:45.839
If this is a more personal email,

00:01:45.839 --> 00:01:49.796
maybe it should come from
lauren@ebarkment.com instead of

00:01:49.796 --> 00:01:53.620
ebarkment.support.donotrespond@ebarkmen-
t.com.

00:01:53.620 --> 00:01:55.170
You have options.

00:01:55.170 --> 00:01:59.760
Now when sending your emails, you can
send a regular old email from Gmail or

00:01:59.760 --> 00:02:01.100
something like that, or

00:02:01.100 --> 00:02:04.830
you can choose an email platform, which
most growing companies choose to do.

00:02:04.830 --> 00:02:07.930
These platforms will vary depending
on the needs of the company.

00:02:07.930 --> 00:02:10.410
So, when deciding on an email platform,

00:02:10.410 --> 00:02:14.550
you'll want to consider the volume of
emails you're sending, the cost, and

00:02:14.550 --> 00:02:17.730
features, like automation and
segmentation.

00:02:17.730 --> 00:02:20.280
There are a few different platforms out
there that are great if you're just

00:02:20.280 --> 00:02:23.940
getting started that are pretty
cost effective, like SinGrid,

00:02:23.940 --> 00:02:25.380
HubSpot, MailChimp.

00:02:25.380 --> 00:02:31.090
And there are also more robust platforms
that have built in automation, advanced

00:02:31.090 --> 00:02:37.550
segmentation, and life cycle emails like
Marketo, Responses, and Exact Target.

00:02:37.550 --> 00:02:39.930
Let's go to Greg and see what he
has to say about email marketing.
