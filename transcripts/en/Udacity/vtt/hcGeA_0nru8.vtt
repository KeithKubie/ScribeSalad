Congratulations. You've made it a long way and

00:00:03.170 --> 00:00:05.687
you've reached the end of lesson five. I

00:00:05.687 --> 00:00:08.450
want to end this lesson with another reflection. Take

00:00:08.450 --> 00:00:10.070
a few moments and write down some of the

00:00:10.070 --> 00:00:11.510
things you've learned in this lesson in the

00:00:11.510 --> 00:00:13.850
text box that will appear. Once you've done

00:00:13.850 --> 00:00:15.690
that, submit your answer and then hear from

00:00:15.690 --> 00:00:17.692
Tim and Moira about what they thought was important.
