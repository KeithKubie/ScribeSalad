00:00:01.100 --> 00:00:09.420
What often distinguishes fulfilled from unfulfilled lives is an ingredient that's not part of the educational curriculum,

00:00:09.420 --> 00:00:13.960
and that can sound vague, silly, and Californian in the bad sense.

00:00:13.960 --> 00:00:15.300
Confidence

00:00:15.300 --> 00:00:22.920
It's humbling to realize just how many great achievements haven't been the result of superior talent or technical know-how,

00:00:22.920 --> 00:00:28.260
merely that strange buoyancy of the soul that we call confidence.

00:00:28.260 --> 00:00:30.560
Why is confidence so easy to lack?

00:00:30.560 --> 00:00:33.200
Partly, it's a hangover from the past.

00:00:33.200 --> 00:00:37.900
For thousands of years, for most of us, there simply were no opportunities for hope:

00:00:37.900 --> 00:00:39.800
we were serfs and slaves,

00:00:39.800 --> 00:00:45.460
and the central psychological survival skill was to keep our heads down and our expectations low.

00:00:45.460 --> 00:00:48.800
Each of us still carries a little of the legacy from that past,

00:00:48.800 --> 00:00:55.540
an attitude of inner serfdom that threatens our spirit deep into a democratic, technological, modern age.

00:00:55.540 --> 00:00:57.740
Hope can feel dangerous.

00:00:57.740 --> 00:01:01.580
There might, in addition, have been parents who sent out subtle messages:

00:01:01.580 --> 00:01:05.040
"People like us don't." "Who do you take yourself for?"

00:01:05.040 --> 00:01:09.720
We should feel compassionate about where those defensive parental messages came from;

00:01:09.720 --> 00:01:14.980
they were a protection, a survival strategy, and an escape from humiliation.

00:01:14.980 --> 00:01:17.300
School didn't necessarily help either;

00:01:17.300 --> 00:01:22.640
it wanted us to be good boys and girls, and taught us to trust in established authority.

00:01:22.640 --> 00:01:28.520
But we may, naively, have gone on too long, putting too much faith in existing institutions,

00:01:28.520 --> 00:01:33.360
and now suffer from doing whatever is asked of us a little too obediently.

00:01:33.360 --> 00:01:38.160
Part of becoming an adult seems to be to embrace the painful realization that

00:01:38.160 --> 00:01:40.960
grown-ups don't actually have the answers,

00:01:40.960 --> 00:01:47.760
and therefore, that we have every right, indeed a duty, to break certain rules and think things through independently.

00:01:47.760 --> 00:01:51.200
We need to learn a calculated form of disrespect,

00:01:51.200 --> 00:01:55.820
which can be a surprising thing after twenty years or so of enforced obedience.

00:01:55.820 --> 00:01:59.580
We need to learn a constructive suspicion of authority:

00:01:59.580 --> 00:02:05.160
a path between total compliance on the one hand, and sullen skepticism on the other.

00:02:05.160 --> 00:02:10.220
In addition, confidence seems to involve a courage to accept imperfection.

00:02:10.220 --> 00:02:14.740
It's tempting never to get going when everything has to be perfect,

00:02:14.740 --> 00:02:17.260
but that's a recipe for remaining under the bed,

00:02:17.260 --> 00:02:23.740
and yet, how often so-called "great lives" have been riddled with errors, that nevertheless, didn't sink them.

00:02:23.740 --> 00:02:29.800
Confidence begins with a capacity to forgive oneself the horrors of the first go.

00:02:29.800 --> 00:02:31.940
Death is a necessary thought too.

00:02:31.940 --> 00:02:38.160
We should use it not to further sadden us, but to scare us, fruitfully, into taking some action.

00:02:38.160 --> 00:02:46.100
Our fear of messing up should give way to the only real danger there is: that of never trying.
