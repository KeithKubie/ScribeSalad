00:00:00.990 --> 00:00:04.590
The Joe Rogan experience.
Do you do any,
uh,

2
00:00:04.591 --> 00:00:08.700
I feel like I've heard you talk about hormone stuff.
Yeah.
Yeah.

3
00:00:08.701 --> 00:00:11.190
I do hormone replacement therapy type of things.

4
00:00:11.191 --> 00:00:15.090
Testosterone and human growth hormone.
You have to give yourself a jap in yeah.

5
00:00:15.220 --> 00:00:18.740
In the thigh.
Thigh.
You won't do the all south simple pride.

6
00:00:19.470 --> 00:00:24.470
I just knew that Mrs Rogan hard time touch that it ties right there.

7
00:00:26.611 --> 00:00:29.460
It's easy to grab when you're rushing back to putting your ass.

8
00:00:29.461 --> 00:00:33.750
It's just like awkward to farmable.
Um,
yeah.

9
00:00:33.751 --> 00:00:38.070
But they also have,
um,
taking whole light.
So you're taking growth hormone,

10
00:00:38.190 --> 00:00:43.190
you not noticed any negative side effects or you get your blood monitored.

11
00:00:43.590 --> 00:00:46.800
You know,
when you,
when you're doing something like that.
This is,
this is also,

12
00:00:46.801 --> 00:00:49.920
if you're a person that has addictive problems,
addiction problems,

13
00:00:50.100 --> 00:00:52.930
which I don't necessarily have them as much with substances,
but have them leave.

14
00:00:53.490 --> 00:00:54.323
Um,

15
00:00:54.490 --> 00:00:58.020
well you saw it with video games when you got here with the video game problem

16
00:00:58.021 --> 00:01:00.480
that I have.
You're frantic,
you're match that at dark room.

17
00:01:00.481 --> 00:01:05.280
You and your sweaty sway and Pi didn't baffled by the real fun too.

18
00:01:05.600 --> 00:01:08.340
Um,
martial arts.
I've been addicted to martial arts.

19
00:01:08.341 --> 00:01:12.510
I've been addicted to playing pool.
I get addicted to getting good at things.

20
00:01:12.570 --> 00:01:15.540
I get very addicted to things.
If there's something that I get obsessed with,

21
00:01:15.541 --> 00:01:17.310
like Jujitsu or whatever it is,

22
00:01:17.311 --> 00:01:21.120
I get obsessed and that's all I think about all day long.
I just had,
I just,

23
00:01:21.300 --> 00:01:24.810
you know,
it's not healthy,
but with um,
hormones,

24
00:01:24.811 --> 00:01:27.870
you want to make sure that you don't overdose yourself.

25
00:01:28.110 --> 00:01:33.110
You want to make sure that you stay within a very narrow range where your,

26
00:01:33.360 --> 00:01:34.710
you know,
your,
you have,

27
00:01:35.340 --> 00:01:40.140
what are the healthy levels of a person that's in there,
you know,

28
00:01:40.170 --> 00:01:42.840
late twenties.
That's really what you want.

29
00:01:43.020 --> 00:01:47.970
You don't want to have hyper human levels,
which some people do do hyper human.

30
00:01:47.971 --> 00:01:51.450
You're going to create an ecosystem.
You're fucking up your body man.

31
00:01:51.451 --> 00:01:54.540
You're just jolting yourself with all this extra shit.
Well,

32
00:01:54.541 --> 00:01:58.350
he about to take this sweet lady thyroid.

33
00:01:58.860 --> 00:02:02.910
Is that part of your system?
Yeah,
I have 'em.
I take Armour thyroid.

34
00:02:02.911 --> 00:02:06.870
It's actually made from pigs.
Thyroids,
you mean picks fibroids now,

35
00:02:07.540 --> 00:02:10.620
but like how would the,
when,
how,
what's happened to the pig?
Dead.
Dead.

36
00:02:10.710 --> 00:02:11.491
They're long gone.

37
00:02:11.491 --> 00:02:16.260
They're not so struggling over lack of really teetering about all emasculated.

38
00:02:16.890 --> 00:02:19.710
Well,
this is like,
so yeah,
I'm interested in this hormone stuff.

39
00:02:19.711 --> 00:02:21.960
I'm interested in that,
but you know me,
I've got to be very,

40
00:02:21.961 --> 00:02:25.380
very like cool shifts about Moodle,

41
00:02:25.400 --> 00:02:27.420
Orrin stuff.
Yeah.

42
00:02:27.510 --> 00:02:30.900
But if you have the exercise regimen that you're talking about,

43
00:02:30.901 --> 00:02:32.580
I don't think you're going to have about a kid,
that blue belt.

44
00:02:32.581 --> 00:02:36.660
I'm going to do what it takes.
Yeah.

45
00:02:36.720 --> 00:02:40.140
Bring me the pinnacle health.
I right out of it directly.
