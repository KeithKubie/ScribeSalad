that drinking alcohol kills brain cells
 

00:01:44.140 --> 00:01:46.200
that drinking alcohol kills brain cells
you know you people make light of this

you know you people make light of this
all the time the truth is that alcohol

00:01:49.440 --> 00:01:49.450
all the time the truth is that alcohol
 

00:01:49.450 --> 00:01:52.620
all the time the truth is that alcohol
can damage the brain but that it's

00:01:52.620 --> 00:01:52.630
can damage the brain but that it's
 

00:01:52.630 --> 00:01:55.500
can damage the brain but that it's
highly unlikely to kill brain cells when

00:01:55.500 --> 00:01:55.510
highly unlikely to kill brain cells when
 

00:01:55.510 --> 00:01:57.930
highly unlikely to kill brain cells when
people look at the brains of alcoholics

post mortem it takes decades of drinking

00:02:00.150 --> 00:02:00.160
post mortem it takes decades of drinking
 

00:02:00.160 --> 00:02:02.969
post mortem it takes decades of drinking
before a loss of brain cells becomes

before a loss of brain cells becomes
 

00:02:02.979 --> 00:02:05.490
before a loss of brain cells becomes
apparent okay so and in fact loss of

apparent okay so and in fact loss of
 

00:02:05.500 --> 00:02:06.510

syndrome and that happens after decades
 

00:02:13.150 --> 00:02:16.520
syndrome and that happens after decades
of drinking now that having been said

00:02:16.520 --> 00:02:16.530
of drinking now that having been said
 

00:02:16.530 --> 00:02:18.930
of drinking now that having been said
alcohol does cause damage to the brain

00:02:18.930 --> 00:02:18.940
alcohol does cause damage to the brain
 

00:02:18.940 --> 00:02:21.060
alcohol does cause damage to the brain
so one thing that has been observed is

00:02:21.060 --> 00:02:21.070
so one thing that has been observed is
 

00:02:21.070 --> 00:02:23.430
so one thing that has been observed is
that heavy drinking for years does lead

00:02:23.430 --> 00:02:23.440
that heavy drinking for years does lead
 

00:02:23.440 --> 00:02:25.500
that heavy drinking for years does lead
to shrinkage of the brain and that is

00:02:25.500 --> 00:02:25.510
to shrinkage of the brain and that is
 

00:02:25.510 --> 00:02:27.120
to shrinkage of the brain and that is
probably the source of the idea that

00:02:27.120 --> 00:02:27.130
probably the source of the idea that
 

00:02:27.130 --> 00:02:28.680
probably the source of the idea that
alcohol kills brain cells that you can

00:02:28.680 --> 00:02:28.690
alcohol kills brain cells that you can
 

00:02:28.690 --> 00:02:30.990
alcohol kills brain cells that you can
observe shrinkage of the brain now let's

00:02:30.990 --> 00:02:31.000
observe shrinkage of the brain now let's
 

00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:32.910
observe shrinkage of the brain now let's
put these two together alcohol causes

00:02:32.910 --> 00:02:32.920
put these two together alcohol causes
 

00:02:32.920 --> 00:02:34.979
put these two together alcohol causes
shrinkage of the brain but the cells

00:02:34.979 --> 00:02:34.989
shrinkage of the brain but the cells
 

00:02:34.989 --> 00:02:37.470
shrinkage of the brain but the cells
don't diminish a number so what that

00:02:37.470 --> 00:02:37.480
don't diminish a number so what that
 

00:02:37.480 --> 00:02:38.940
don't diminish a number so what that
suggests is there's something about each

00:02:38.940 --> 00:02:38.950
suggests is there's something about each
 

00:02:38.950 --> 00:02:40.380
suggests is there's something about each
individual cell that's shrinking and

00:02:40.380 --> 00:02:40.390
individual cell that's shrinking and
 

00:02:40.390 --> 00:02:42.690
individual cell that's shrinking and
what's believed is that that the trees

00:02:42.690 --> 00:02:42.700
what's believed is that that the trees
 

00:02:42.700 --> 00:02:44.160
what's believed is that that the trees
the dendritic trees that neurons have

00:02:44.160 --> 00:02:44.170
the dendritic trees that neurons have
 

00:02:44.170 --> 00:02:46.500
the dendritic trees that neurons have
may retract a little bit and then they

00:02:46.500 --> 00:02:46.510
may retract a little bit and then they
 

00:02:46.510 --> 00:02:48.390
may retract a little bit and then they
are constantly growing and shrinking and

00:02:48.390 --> 00:02:48.400
are constantly growing and shrinking and
 

00:02:48.400 --> 00:02:50.490
are constantly growing and shrinking and
so what's believed is that perhaps they

00:02:50.490 --> 00:02:50.500
so what's believed is that perhaps they
 

00:02:50.500 --> 00:02:52.410
so what's believed is that perhaps they
retract a little bit and the practical

00:02:52.410 --> 00:02:52.420
retract a little bit and the practical
 

00:02:52.420 --> 00:02:53.850
retract a little bit and the practical
implication of this is that if you stop

00:02:53.850 --> 00:02:53.860
implication of this is that if you stop
 

00:02:53.860 --> 00:02:55.620
implication of this is that if you stop
drinking then they perhaps will grow

00:02:55.620 --> 00:02:55.630
drinking then they perhaps will grow
 

00:02:55.630 --> 00:02:57.150
drinking then they perhaps will grow
back okay so that's the practical

00:02:57.150 --> 00:02:57.160
back okay so that's the practical
 

00:02:57.160 --> 00:02:59.970
back okay so that's the practical
implication and so even though the the

00:02:59.970 --> 00:02:59.980
implication and so even though the the
 

00:02:59.980 --> 00:03:02.430
implication and so even though the the
myth even though the idea is a myth it's

00:03:02.430 --> 00:03:02.440
myth even though the idea is a myth it's
 

00:03:02.440 --> 00:03:03.360
myth even though the idea is a myth it's
still important to remember that

00:03:03.360 --> 00:03:03.370
still important to remember that
 

00:03:03.370 --> 00:03:06.449
still important to remember that
drinking alcohol is not a good thing for

00:03:06.449 --> 00:03:06.459
drinking alcohol is not a good thing for
 

00:03:06.459 --> 00:03:07.560
drinking alcohol is not a good thing for

at a time I have more that I forgot to

00:03:10.140 --> 00:03:10.150
at a time I have more that I forgot to

at a time I have more that I forgot to
give so can I throw that in okay sorry

00:03:12.509 --> 00:03:12.519
give so can I throw that in okay sorry
 

00:03:12.519 --> 00:03:14.940
give so can I throw that in okay sorry
about that okay the other side of the

00:03:14.940 --> 00:03:14.950
about that okay the other side of the
 

00:03:14.950 --> 00:03:17.850
about that okay the other side of the
coin is that moderate amounts of alcohol

00:03:17.850 --> 00:03:17.860
coin is that moderate amounts of alcohol
 

00:03:17.860 --> 00:03:20.850
coin is that moderate amounts of alcohol
are not harmful and in some cases can

00:03:20.850 --> 00:03:20.860
are not harmful and in some cases can
 

00:03:20.860 --> 00:03:22.229
are not harmful and in some cases can
even be helpful and there's a very

00:03:22.229 --> 00:03:22.239
even be helpful and there's a very
 

00:03:22.239 --> 00:03:24.960
even be helpful and there's a very
specific case which is red wine it turns

00:03:24.960 --> 00:03:24.970
specific case which is red wine it turns
 

00:03:24.970 --> 00:03:27.030
specific case which is red wine it turns
out that moderate amounts of red wine

00:03:27.030 --> 00:03:27.040
out that moderate amounts of red wine
 

00:03:27.040 --> 00:03:28.920
out that moderate amounts of red wine
seem to have some kind of protective

00:03:28.920 --> 00:03:28.930
seem to have some kind of protective
 

00:03:28.930 --> 00:03:31.110
seem to have some kind of protective
effect on brain function especially as

00:03:31.110 --> 00:03:31.120
effect on brain function especially as
 

00:03:31.120 --> 00:03:33.390
effect on brain function especially as
you are getting older and it's not known

00:03:33.390 --> 00:03:33.400
you are getting older and it's not known
 

00:03:33.400 --> 00:03:35.070
you are getting older and it's not known
exactly why but there's a general

00:03:35.070 --> 00:03:35.080
exactly why but there's a general
 

00:03:35.080 --> 00:03:36.630
exactly why but there's a general
principle which is that things that are

00:03:36.630 --> 00:03:36.640
principle which is that things that are
 

00:03:36.640 --> 00:03:38.039
principle which is that things that are
good for your heart and your

00:03:38.039 --> 00:03:38.049
good for your heart and your
 

00:03:38.049 --> 00:03:40.229
good for your heart and your
cardiovascular system are also good for

00:03:40.229 --> 00:03:40.239
cardiovascular system are also good for
 

00:03:40.239 --> 00:03:42.720
cardiovascular system are also good for
your brain and so there are health

00:03:42.720 --> 00:03:42.730
your brain and so there are health
 

00:03:42.730 --> 00:03:44.640
your brain and so there are health
benefits that been demonstrated of red

00:03:44.640 --> 00:03:44.650
benefits that been demonstrated of red
 

00:03:44.650 --> 00:03:46.680
benefits that been demonstrated of red
wine some of which are mediated through

00:03:46.680 --> 00:03:46.690
wine some of which are mediated through
 

00:03:46.690 --> 00:03:49.800
wine some of which are mediated through
the compound resveratrol and what's been

00:03:49.800 --> 00:03:49.810
the compound resveratrol and what's been
 

00:03:49.810 --> 00:03:51.210
the compound resveratrol and what's been
observed is that up

00:03:51.210 --> 00:03:51.220
observed is that up
 

00:03:51.220 --> 00:03:53.700
observed is that up
- three glasses of red wine per day for

00:03:53.700 --> 00:03:53.710
- three glasses of red wine per day for
 

00:03:53.710 --> 00:03:56.850
- three glasses of red wine per day for
men and up to two glasses for women is

00:03:56.850 --> 00:03:56.860
men and up to two glasses for women is
 

00:03:56.860 --> 00:03:58.920
men and up to two glasses for women is
either neutral or slightly beneficial

00:03:58.920 --> 00:03:58.930
either neutral or slightly beneficial
 

00:03:58.930 --> 00:04:00.930
either neutral or slightly beneficial
for brain function and that adds up to a

00:04:00.930 --> 00:04:00.940
for brain function and that adds up to a
 

00:04:00.940 --> 00:04:03.240
for brain function and that adds up to a
bottle for a couple per day so that's

00:04:03.240 --> 00:04:03.250
bottle for a couple per day so that's
 

00:04:03.250 --> 00:04:07.100
bottle for a couple per day so that's
you know easy to remember

00:04:07.100 --> 00:04:07.110
 

00:04:07.110 --> 00:04:10.580
all drugs exert their effects by acting

00:04:10.580 --> 00:04:10.590
all drugs exert their effects by acting
 

00:04:10.590 --> 00:04:12.010
all drugs exert their effects by acting
on some kind of receptor in the brain

00:04:12.010 --> 00:04:12.020
on some kind of receptor in the brain
 

00:04:12.020 --> 00:04:15.110
on some kind of receptor in the brain
and in some cases in many cases that

00:04:15.110 --> 00:04:15.120
and in some cases in many cases that
 

00:04:15.120 --> 00:04:16.910
and in some cases in many cases that
receptor is identified so for instance

00:04:16.910 --> 00:04:16.920
receptor is identified so for instance
 

00:04:16.920 --> 00:04:18.979
receptor is identified so for instance
to pick an example cocaine and

00:04:18.979 --> 00:04:18.989
to pick an example cocaine and
 

00:04:18.989 --> 00:04:21.800
to pick an example cocaine and
methamphetamine act upon a drug whose

00:04:21.800 --> 00:04:21.810
methamphetamine act upon a drug whose
 

00:04:21.810 --> 00:04:25.910
methamphetamine act upon a drug whose
job at it to pick an example cocaine and

00:04:25.910 --> 00:04:25.920
job at it to pick an example cocaine and
 

00:04:25.920 --> 00:04:27.530
job at it to pick an example cocaine and
methamphetamine act upon a molecule

00:04:27.530 --> 00:04:27.540
methamphetamine act upon a molecule
 

00:04:27.540 --> 00:04:30.230
methamphetamine act upon a molecule
whose job it is to suck up dopamine back

00:04:30.230 --> 00:04:30.240
whose job it is to suck up dopamine back
 

00:04:30.240 --> 00:04:32.540
whose job it is to suck up dopamine back
into cells after it's been released and

00:04:32.540 --> 00:04:32.550
into cells after it's been released and
 

00:04:32.550 --> 00:04:34.580
into cells after it's been released and
so those are blockers of dopamine

00:04:34.580 --> 00:04:34.590
so those are blockers of dopamine
 

00:04:34.590 --> 00:04:37.220
so those are blockers of dopamine
reuptake another example is LSD which

00:04:37.220 --> 00:04:37.230
reuptake another example is LSD which
 

00:04:37.230 --> 00:04:40.100
reuptake another example is LSD which
acts upon very specific receptors for

00:04:40.100 --> 00:04:40.110
acts upon very specific receptors for
 

00:04:40.110 --> 00:04:42.440
acts upon very specific receptors for
the neurotransmitter serotonin so all

00:04:42.440 --> 00:04:42.450
the neurotransmitter serotonin so all
 

00:04:42.450 --> 00:04:44.030
the neurotransmitter serotonin so all
these act upon different receptors to

00:04:44.030 --> 00:04:44.040
these act upon different receptors to
 

00:04:44.040 --> 00:04:45.620
these act upon different receptors to
cause their effects to cause

00:04:45.620 --> 00:04:45.630
cause their effects to cause
 

00:04:45.630 --> 00:04:47.750
cause their effects to cause
hallucinations or intoxication or

00:04:47.750 --> 00:04:47.760
hallucinations or intoxication or
 

00:04:47.760 --> 00:04:50.140
hallucinations or intoxication or
feelings of confidence or what-have-you

00:04:50.140 --> 00:04:50.150
feelings of confidence or what-have-you
 

00:04:50.150 --> 00:04:54.409
feelings of confidence or what-have-you
and a consequence of that is that they

00:04:54.409 --> 00:04:54.419
and a consequence of that is that they
 

00:04:54.419 --> 00:04:56.240
and a consequence of that is that they
are addictive to differing degrees so

00:04:56.240 --> 00:04:56.250
are addictive to differing degrees so
 

00:04:56.250 --> 00:04:57.820
are addictive to differing degrees so
for instance alcohol is addictive

00:04:57.820 --> 00:04:57.830
for instance alcohol is addictive
 

00:04:57.830 --> 00:05:00.250
for instance alcohol is addictive
nicotine in cigarettes is addictive

00:05:00.250 --> 00:05:00.260
nicotine in cigarettes is addictive
 

00:05:00.260 --> 00:05:02.690
nicotine in cigarettes is addictive
cocaine and meth methamphetamine are

00:05:02.690 --> 00:05:02.700
cocaine and meth methamphetamine are
 

00:05:02.700 --> 00:05:04.850
cocaine and meth methamphetamine are
highly addictive and so those tend to

00:05:04.850 --> 00:05:04.860
highly addictive and so those tend to
 

00:05:04.860 --> 00:05:07.340
highly addictive and so those tend to
lead to dependencies and bad effects

00:05:07.340 --> 00:05:07.350
lead to dependencies and bad effects
 

00:05:07.350 --> 00:05:09.290
lead to dependencies and bad effects

00:05:11.400 --> 00:05:13.280
trapped and using those things other
drugs seem to not have much addictive

00:05:13.280 --> 00:05:13.290
drugs seem to not have much addictive
 

00:05:13.290 --> 00:05:16.420
drugs seem to not have much addictive
potential and you mentioned LSD LSD is

00:05:16.420 --> 00:05:16.430
potential and you mentioned LSD LSD is
 

00:05:16.430 --> 00:05:18.830

00:05:18.840 --> 00:05:21.050
not addictive so far as anyone can tell
and does not seem to lead to long-term

00:05:21.050 --> 00:05:21.060
and does not seem to lead to long-term
 

00:05:21.060 --> 00:05:23.510
and does not seem to lead to long-term
harmful effects all these drugs act on

00:05:23.510 --> 00:05:23.520

methamphetamine a rule of thumb seems to
 

00:06:51.389 --> 00:06:53.450
methamphetamine a rule of thumb seems to
be that drugs that block dopamine uptake

00:06:53.450 --> 00:06:53.460
be that drugs that block dopamine uptake
 

00:06:53.460 --> 00:06:56.030
be that drugs that block dopamine uptake
have a lot of potential for addiction

00:06:56.030 --> 00:06:56.040
have a lot of potential for addiction
 

00:06:56.040 --> 00:06:58.730
have a lot of potential for addiction
and that's because addiction seems to

00:06:58.730 --> 00:06:58.740
and that's because addiction seems to
 

00:06:58.740 --> 00:07:00.710

so dopamine uptake blockers seem to be

00:07:07.040 --> 00:07:07.050
so dopamine uptake blockers seem to be
 

00:07:07.050 --> 00:07:10.279
so dopamine uptake blockers seem to be
bad for the brain

00:07:10.279 --> 00:07:10.289
 

00:07:10.289 --> 00:07:12.230
I think Goldman's ideas are very

00:07:12.230 --> 00:07:12.240
I think Goldman's ideas are very
 

00:07:12.240 --> 00:07:15.379
I think Goldman's ideas are very
interesting there's this old-school idea

00:07:15.379 --> 00:07:15.389
interesting there's this old-school idea
 

00:07:15.389 --> 00:07:16.790
interesting there's this old-school idea
that I that basically no one believes

00:07:16.790 --> 00:07:16.800
that I that basically no one believes
 

00:07:16.800 --> 00:07:19.279
that I that basically no one believes
anymore which is that intelligence is

00:07:19.279 --> 00:07:19.289
anymore which is that intelligence is
 

00:07:19.289 --> 00:07:21.679
anymore which is that intelligence is
just described by one factor or a

00:07:21.679 --> 00:07:21.689
just described by one factor or a
 

00:07:21.689 --> 00:07:23.510
just described by one factor or a
parameter that people used to call G for

00:07:23.510 --> 00:07:23.520
parameter that people used to call G for
 

00:07:23.520 --> 00:07:25.279
parameter that people used to call G for
general intelligence and that you either

00:07:25.279 --> 00:07:25.289
general intelligence and that you either
 

00:07:25.289 --> 00:07:26.869
general intelligence and that you either
had more of it or you had less of it and

00:07:26.869 --> 00:07:26.879
had more of it or you had less of it and
 

00:07:26.879 --> 00:07:29.450
had more of it or you had less of it and
and a certain element of that is still

00:07:29.450 --> 00:07:29.460
and a certain element of that is still
 

00:07:29.460 --> 00:07:30.769
and a certain element of that is still
true because there is a thing that you

00:07:30.769 --> 00:07:30.779
true because there is a thing that you
 

00:07:30.779 --> 00:07:32.779
true because there is a thing that you
can measure on tests that has to do with

00:07:32.779 --> 00:07:32.789
can measure on tests that has to do with
 

00:07:32.789 --> 00:07:34.939
can measure on tests that has to do with
fluid problem-solving that one that

00:07:34.939 --> 00:07:34.949
fluid problem-solving that one that
 

00:07:34.949 --> 00:07:36.889
fluid problem-solving that one that
people still call G and so that part's

00:07:36.889 --> 00:07:36.899
people still call G and so that part's
 

00:07:36.899 --> 00:07:38.899
people still call G and so that part's
true but I think one thing that's

00:07:38.899 --> 00:07:38.909
true but I think one thing that's
 

00:07:38.909 --> 00:07:41.269
true but I think one thing that's
interesting there with Goldman is the

00:07:41.269 --> 00:07:41.279
interesting there with Goldman is the
 

00:07:41.279 --> 00:07:42.799
interesting there with Goldman is the
idea that there are many mental

00:07:42.799 --> 00:07:42.809
idea that there are many mental
 

00:07:42.809 --> 00:07:45.439
idea that there are many mental
capacities that we have and they are to

00:07:45.439 --> 00:07:45.449
capacities that we have and they are to
 

00:07:45.449 --> 00:07:47.119
capacities that we have and they are to
a certain degree independent of one

00:07:47.119 --> 00:07:47.129
a certain degree independent of one
 

00:07:47.129 --> 00:07:48.739
a certain degree independent of one
another now it turns out they're less

00:07:48.739 --> 00:07:48.749
another now it turns out they're less
 

00:07:48.749 --> 00:07:50.809
another now it turns out they're less
independent than one might imagine it

00:07:50.809 --> 00:07:50.819
independent than one might imagine it
 

00:07:50.819 --> 00:07:52.429
independent than one might imagine it
turns out that on average people who are

00:07:52.429 --> 00:07:52.439
turns out that on average people who are
 

00:07:52.439 --> 00:07:57.439
turns out that on average people who are
better at say IQ tests on average tend

00:07:57.439 --> 00:07:57.449
better at say IQ tests on average tend
 

00:07:57.449 --> 00:08:00.199
better at say IQ tests on average tend
to be better in in social intelligence

00:08:00.199 --> 00:08:00.209
to be better in in social intelligence
 

00:08:00.209 --> 00:08:02.119
to be better in in social intelligence
now that might be hard to believe when

00:08:02.119 --> 00:08:02.129
now that might be hard to believe when
 

00:08:02.129 --> 00:08:04.609
now that might be hard to believe when
you go to university and quiz your

00:08:04.609 --> 00:08:04.619
you go to university and quiz your
 

00:08:04.619 --> 00:08:06.529
you go to university and quiz your
average mathematician you know not all

00:08:06.529 --> 00:08:06.539
average mathematician you know not all
 

00:08:06.539 --> 00:08:09.230
average mathematician you know not all
those people are all that socially

00:08:09.230 --> 00:08:09.240
those people are all that socially
 

00:08:09.240 --> 00:08:12.499
those people are all that socially
advanced but nonetheless there is a

00:08:12.499 --> 00:08:12.509
advanced but nonetheless there is a
 

00:08:12.509 --> 00:08:14.209
advanced but nonetheless there is a
positive relationship among these things

00:08:14.209 --> 00:08:14.219
positive relationship among these things
 

00:08:14.219 --> 00:08:15.679
positive relationship among these things
and they rely on slightly different

00:08:15.679 --> 00:08:15.689
and they rely on slightly different
 

00:08:15.689 --> 00:08:17.209
and they rely on slightly different
brain systems and so I think it's

00:08:17.209 --> 00:08:17.219
brain systems and so I think it's
 

00:08:17.219 --> 00:08:20.299
brain systems and so I think it's
possible for these capacities to be

00:08:20.299 --> 00:08:20.309
possible for these capacities to be
 

00:08:20.309 --> 00:08:24.900
possible for these capacities to be
somewhat independent of one another

00:08:24.900 --> 00:08:24.910
 

00:08:24.910 --> 00:08:29.080
creativity is a pretty general concept

00:08:29.080 --> 00:08:29.090
creativity is a pretty general concept
 

00:08:29.090 --> 00:08:31.030
creativity is a pretty general concept
and in order to reduce it into something

00:08:31.030 --> 00:08:31.040
and in order to reduce it into something
 

00:08:31.040 --> 00:08:32.950
and in order to reduce it into something
you can study you have to start thinking

00:08:32.950 --> 00:08:32.960
you can study you have to start thinking
 

00:08:32.960 --> 00:08:34.779
you can study you have to start thinking
about a problem that you can give

00:08:34.779 --> 00:08:34.789
about a problem that you can give
 

00:08:34.789 --> 00:08:36.700
about a problem that you can give
somebody in the laboratory and so for

00:08:36.700 --> 00:08:36.710
somebody in the laboratory and so for
 

00:08:36.710 --> 00:08:39.940
somebody in the laboratory and so for
instance there's a kind of problem

00:08:39.940 --> 00:08:39.950
instance there's a kind of problem
 

00:08:39.950 --> 00:08:42.630
instance there's a kind of problem
solving called divergent thinking

00:08:42.630 --> 00:08:42.640
solving called divergent thinking
 

00:08:42.640 --> 00:08:44.860
solving called divergent thinking
finding solutions that other people do

00:08:44.860 --> 00:08:44.870
finding solutions that other people do
 

00:08:44.870 --> 00:08:46.990
finding solutions that other people do
not find in the same problem okay so for

00:08:46.990 --> 00:08:47.000
not find in the same problem okay so for
 

00:08:47.000 --> 00:08:48.340
not find in the same problem okay so for
instance an example of creativity and an

00:08:48.340 --> 00:08:48.350
instance an example of creativity and an
 

00:08:48.350 --> 00:08:50.980
instance an example of creativity and an
animal might be if you have a crow so

00:08:50.980 --> 00:08:50.990
animal might be if you have a crow so
 

00:08:50.990 --> 00:08:53.440
animal might be if you have a crow so
imagine a box in which the box can

00:08:53.440 --> 00:08:53.450
imagine a box in which the box can
 

00:08:53.450 --> 00:08:54.760
imagine a box in which the box can
either be opened by flipping the lid

00:08:54.760 --> 00:08:54.770
either be opened by flipping the lid
 

00:08:54.770 --> 00:08:57.280
either be opened by flipping the lid
like this or by pulling on the lid like

00:08:57.280 --> 00:08:57.290
like this or by pulling on the lid like
 

00:08:57.290 --> 00:09:00.430
like this or by pulling on the lid like
this and what's what ethology have

00:09:00.430 --> 00:09:00.440
this and what's what ethology have
 

00:09:00.440 --> 00:09:01.840
this and what's what ethology have
discovered is that when you take a crow

00:09:01.840 --> 00:09:01.850
discovered is that when you take a crow
 

00:09:01.850 --> 00:09:04.720
discovered is that when you take a crow
most crows will learn how to open the

00:09:04.720 --> 00:09:04.730
most crows will learn how to open the
 

00:09:04.730 --> 00:09:07.180
most crows will learn how to open the
box like this and flip it like that okay

00:09:07.180 --> 00:09:07.190
box like this and flip it like that okay
 

00:09:07.190 --> 00:09:09.430
box like this and flip it like that okay
and occasionally a crow will have the

00:09:09.430 --> 00:09:09.440
and occasionally a crow will have the
 

00:09:09.440 --> 00:09:12.100
and occasionally a crow will have the
innovative thought of of pulling the box

00:09:12.100 --> 00:09:12.110
innovative thought of of pulling the box
 

00:09:12.110 --> 00:09:13.900
innovative thought of of pulling the box
the other way okay so that's an example

00:09:13.900 --> 00:09:13.910
the other way okay so that's an example
 

00:09:13.910 --> 00:09:15.040
the other way okay so that's an example
of divergent thinking that you can

00:09:15.040 --> 00:09:15.050
of divergent thinking that you can
 

00:09:15.050 --> 00:09:16.960
of divergent thinking that you can
identify in a crow and crows even have

00:09:16.960 --> 00:09:16.970
identify in a crow and crows even have
 

00:09:16.970 --> 00:09:18.250
identify in a crow and crows even have
social learning so for instance if one

00:09:18.250 --> 00:09:18.260
social learning so for instance if one
 

00:09:18.260 --> 00:09:22.090
social learning so for instance if one
crow sees another crow doing this it's

00:09:22.090 --> 00:09:22.100
crow sees another crow doing this it's
 

00:09:22.100 --> 00:09:24.130
crow sees another crow doing this it's
actually a raven if one raven sees

00:09:24.130 --> 00:09:24.140
actually a raven if one raven sees
 

00:09:24.140 --> 00:09:26.530
actually a raven if one raven sees
another raven do this then in fact it

00:09:26.530 --> 00:09:26.540
another raven do this then in fact it
 

00:09:26.540 --> 00:09:28.510
another raven do this then in fact it
can learn to do the the innov way

00:09:28.510 --> 00:09:28.520
can learn to do the the innov way
 

00:09:28.520 --> 00:09:30.190
can learn to do the the innov way
innovative way of solving the problem

00:09:30.190 --> 00:09:30.200
innovative way of solving the problem
 

00:09:30.200 --> 00:09:31.630
innovative way of solving the problem
right away and that's an example of

00:09:31.630 --> 00:09:31.640
right away and that's an example of
 

00:09:31.640 --> 00:09:33.160
right away and that's an example of
social learning and this is clearly

00:09:33.160 --> 00:09:33.170
social learning and this is clearly
 

00:09:33.170 --> 00:09:34.420
social learning and this is clearly
something that's very highly developed

00:09:34.420 --> 00:09:34.430
something that's very highly developed
 

00:09:34.430 --> 00:09:36.640
something that's very highly developed
in us right our cultural evolution

00:09:36.640 --> 00:09:36.650
in us right our cultural evolution
 

00:09:36.650 --> 00:09:39.130
in us right our cultural evolution
occurs far far faster than biological

00:09:39.130 --> 00:09:39.140
occurs far far faster than biological
 

00:09:39.140 --> 00:09:41.260
occurs far far faster than biological
evolution and so that kind of creativity

00:09:41.260 --> 00:09:41.270
evolution and so that kind of creativity
 

00:09:41.270 --> 00:09:43.570
evolution and so that kind of creativity
of tool-making is something that that

00:09:43.570 --> 00:09:43.580
of tool-making is something that that
 

00:09:43.580 --> 00:09:45.280
of tool-making is something that that
crows have a surprising amount of and

00:09:45.280 --> 00:09:45.290
crows have a surprising amount of and
 

00:09:45.290 --> 00:09:48.340
crows have a surprising amount of and
that we have and so one question is how

00:09:48.340 --> 00:09:48.350
that we have and so one question is how
 

00:09:48.350 --> 00:09:50.199
that we have and so one question is how
to study these things and and you have

00:09:50.199 --> 00:09:50.209
to study these things and and you have
 

00:09:50.209 --> 00:09:52.060
to study these things and and you have
to cook up tasks that are or more

00:09:52.060 --> 00:09:52.070
to cook up tasks that are or more
 

00:09:52.070 --> 00:09:53.920
to cook up tasks that are or more
germane so for instance that one example

00:09:53.920 --> 00:09:53.930
germane so for instance that one example
 

00:09:53.930 --> 00:09:56.890
germane so for instance that one example
is left-handers on average left-handers

00:09:56.890 --> 00:09:56.900
is left-handers on average left-handers
 

00:09:56.900 --> 00:09:59.380
is left-handers on average left-handers
seem to be more prone to divergent

00:09:59.380 --> 00:09:59.390
seem to be more prone to divergent
 

00:09:59.390 --> 00:10:01.240
seem to be more prone to divergent
thinking and creative ways of solving

00:10:01.240 --> 00:10:01.250
thinking and creative ways of solving
 

00:10:01.250 --> 00:10:02.680
thinking and creative ways of solving
problems at least in a laboratory

00:10:02.680 --> 00:10:02.690
problems at least in a laboratory
 

00:10:02.690 --> 00:10:05.079
problems at least in a laboratory
context and so that's one example of a

00:10:05.079 --> 00:10:05.089
context and so that's one example of a
 

00:10:05.089 --> 00:10:06.699
context and so that's one example of a
demographic that seems to have more of

00:10:06.699 --> 00:10:06.709
demographic that seems to have more of
 

00:10:06.709 --> 00:10:10.670
demographic that seems to have more of
this whatever it is

00:10:10.670 --> 00:10:10.680
 

00:10:10.680 --> 00:10:13.070
the popular belief about the left brain

00:10:13.070 --> 00:10:13.080
the popular belief about the left brain
 

00:10:13.080 --> 00:10:14.150
the popular belief about the left brain
and the right brain and people are

00:10:14.150 --> 00:10:14.160
and the right brain and people are
 

00:10:14.160 --> 00:10:15.470
and the right brain and people are
usually talking about the cerebral

00:10:15.470 --> 00:10:15.480
usually talking about the cerebral
 

00:10:15.480 --> 00:10:16.820
usually talking about the cerebral
cortex when they talk about these things

00:10:16.820 --> 00:10:16.830
cortex when they talk about these things
 

00:10:16.830 --> 00:10:19.010
cortex when they talk about these things
is that the left half of the brain is

00:10:19.010 --> 00:10:19.020
is that the left half of the brain is
 

00:10:19.020 --> 00:10:22.430
is that the left half of the brain is
rational and problem-solving and a none

00:10:22.430 --> 00:10:22.440
rational and problem-solving and a none
 

00:10:22.440 --> 00:10:24.320
rational and problem-solving and a none
creative and somehow the right brain is

00:10:24.320 --> 00:10:24.330
creative and somehow the right brain is
 

00:10:24.330 --> 00:10:26.450
creative and somehow the right brain is
creative it can help you draw better

00:10:26.450 --> 00:10:26.460
creative it can help you draw better
 

00:10:26.460 --> 00:10:30.080
creative it can help you draw better
right now the truth is more complicated

00:10:30.080 --> 00:10:30.090
right now the truth is more complicated
 

00:10:30.090 --> 00:10:31.730
right now the truth is more complicated
because in fact the hemispheres of the

00:10:33.450 --> 00:10:35.240
brain because the hemispheres of the
brain are heavily interconnected by the

00:10:35.240 --> 00:10:35.250
brain are heavily interconnected by the
 

00:10:35.250 --> 00:10:36.830
brain are heavily interconnected by the
structure that's this basically this

00:10:36.830 --> 00:10:36.840
structure that's this basically this
 

00:10:36.840 --> 00:10:38.480
structure that's this basically this
dense band of fibers called the corpus

00:10:38.480 --> 00:10:38.490
dense band of fibers called the corpus
 

00:10:38.490 --> 00:10:41.240
dense band of fibers called the corpus
callosum and what seems to be really the

00:10:41.240 --> 00:10:41.250
callosum and what seems to be really the
 

00:10:41.250 --> 00:10:43.310
callosum and what seems to be really the
case is the left half of the brain is

00:10:43.310 --> 00:10:43.320
case is the left half of the brain is
 

00:10:43.320 --> 00:10:45.650
case is the left half of the brain is
important for for mathematical reasoning

00:10:45.650 --> 00:10:45.660
important for for mathematical reasoning
 

00:10:45.660 --> 00:10:48.050
important for for mathematical reasoning
for generating language but it's also a

callosum cut when you show a picture and

00:10:54.650 --> 00:10:54.660
callosum cut when you show a picture and
 

00:10:54.660 --> 00:10:56.450
callosum cut when you show a picture and
you play picture association with them

00:10:56.450 --> 00:10:56.460
you play picture association with them
 

00:10:56.460 --> 00:10:57.890
you play picture association with them
with the right half of the brain by

00:10:57.890 --> 00:10:57.900
with the right half of the brain by
 

00:10:57.900 --> 00:11:00.350
with the right half of the brain by
showing the left half of the world of

00:11:00.350 --> 00:11:00.360
showing the left half of the world of
 

00:11:00.360 --> 00:11:02.330
showing the left half of the world of
the person's world things and ask the

00:11:02.330 --> 00:11:02.340
the person's world things and ask the
 

00:11:02.340 --> 00:11:03.650
the person's world things and ask the
right half of the brain to do something

00:11:03.650 --> 00:11:03.660
right half of the brain to do something
 

00:11:03.660 --> 00:11:05.270
right half of the brain to do something
the right half the brain will happily

00:11:05.270 --> 00:11:05.280
the right half the brain will happily
 

00:11:05.280 --> 00:11:07.100
the right half the brain will happily
play picture association and then if you

00:11:07.100 --> 00:11:07.110
play picture association and then if you
 

00:11:07.110 --> 00:11:08.660
play picture association and then if you
ask the person well why did you make

00:11:08.660 --> 00:11:08.670
ask the person well why did you make

that Association the left half of the
 

00:11:10.740 --> 00:11:12.320
that Association the left half of the
brain makes up a story so for instance

00:11:12.320 --> 00:11:12.330
brain makes up a story so for instance
 

00:11:12.330 --> 00:11:14.180
brain makes up a story so for instance
you could show the right half of the

00:11:14.180 --> 00:11:14.190
you could show the right half of the
 

00:11:14.190 --> 00:11:19.970
you could show the right half of the
brain a snow scene and a chicken claw

00:11:19.970 --> 00:11:19.980
brain a snow scene and a chicken claw
 

00:11:19.980 --> 00:11:22.040
brain a snow scene and a chicken claw
and the left brain sees the chicken claw

00:11:22.040 --> 00:11:22.050
and the left brain sees the chicken claw
 

00:11:22.050 --> 00:11:24.380
and the left brain sees the chicken claw
the right brain sees the snow scene and

00:11:24.380 --> 00:11:24.390
the right brain sees the snow scene and
 

00:11:24.390 --> 00:11:25.550
the right brain sees the snow scene and
then you said you have the right brain

00:11:25.550 --> 00:11:25.560
then you said you have the right brain
 

00:11:25.560 --> 00:11:27.320
then you said you have the right brain
well you know what goes with it and the

00:11:27.320 --> 00:11:27.330
well you know what goes with it and the
 

00:11:27.330 --> 00:11:29.150
well you know what goes with it and the
right brain will pick a shovel and then

00:11:29.150 --> 00:11:29.160
right brain will pick a shovel and then
 

00:11:29.160 --> 00:11:31.040
right brain will pick a shovel and then
the us left brain will why did you pick

00:11:31.040 --> 00:11:31.050
the us left brain will why did you pick
 

00:11:31.050 --> 00:11:32.990
the us left brain will why did you pick
a shovel and the left brain saw the

00:11:32.990 --> 00:11:33.000
a shovel and the left brain saw the
 

00:11:33.000 --> 00:11:34.940
a shovel and the left brain saw the
chicken claw and the left brain makes up

00:11:34.940 --> 00:11:34.950
chicken claw and the left brain makes up
 

00:11:34.950 --> 00:11:36.560
chicken claw and the left brain makes up
this crazy story the left brain will say

00:11:36.560 --> 00:11:36.570
this crazy story the left brain will say
 

00:11:36.570 --> 00:11:38.300
this crazy story the left brain will say
well you know the chicken lives in it

00:11:38.300 --> 00:11:38.310
well you know the chicken lives in it
 

00:11:38.310 --> 00:11:40.340
well you know the chicken lives in it
that's a claw it goes with a chicken the

00:11:40.340 --> 00:11:40.350
that's a claw it goes with a chicken the
 

00:11:40.350 --> 00:11:41.720
that's a claw it goes with a chicken the
chicken lives in a coop you need a

00:11:41.720 --> 00:11:41.730
chicken lives in a coop you need a
 

00:11:41.730 --> 00:11:43.550
chicken lives in a coop you need a
shovel to shovel out the chicken coop

00:11:43.550 --> 00:11:43.560
shovel to shovel out the chicken coop
 

00:11:43.560 --> 00:11:45.440
shovel to shovel out the chicken coop
it's this totally made-up story and so

00:11:45.440 --> 00:11:45.450
it's this totally made-up story and so
 

00:11:45.450 --> 00:11:46.550
it's this totally made-up story and so
it turns out that the left half of the

00:11:46.550 --> 00:11:46.560
it turns out that the left half of the
 

00:11:46.560 --> 00:11:48.110
it turns out that the left half of the
brain is perfectly capable of making up

00:11:48.110 --> 00:11:48.120
brain is perfectly capable of making up
 

00:11:48.120 --> 00:11:50.140
brain is perfectly capable of making up
stories and so that seems to be you know

00:11:50.140 --> 00:11:50.150
stories and so that seems to be you know
 

00:11:50.150 --> 00:11:52.580
stories and so that seems to be you know
that's sort of creative right so that's

00:11:52.580 --> 00:11:52.590
that's sort of creative right so that's
 

00:11:52.590 --> 00:11:55.310
that's sort of creative right so that's
not really that doesn't fit the

00:11:55.310 --> 00:11:55.320
not really that doesn't fit the
 

00:11:55.320 --> 00:11:57.050
not really that doesn't fit the
stereotype I think what's more the case

00:11:57.050 --> 00:11:57.060
stereotype I think what's more the case
 

00:11:57.060 --> 00:11:58.910
stereotype I think what's more the case
is that the right brain is important for

00:11:58.910 --> 00:11:58.920
is that the right brain is important for
 

00:11:58.920 --> 00:12:00.230
is that the right brain is important for
certain things so for instance the left

00:12:00.230 --> 00:12:00.240
certain things so for instance the left
 

00:12:00.240 --> 00:12:02.180
certain things so for instance the left
brain produces language the right brain

00:12:02.180 --> 00:12:02.190
brain produces language the right brain
 

00:12:02.190 --> 00:12:04.640
brain produces language the right brain
produces prosody which is the emotional

00:12:04.640 --> 00:12:04.650
produces prosody which is the emotional
 

00:12:04.650 --> 00:12:06.860
produces prosody which is the emotional
content of our language in many ways the

00:12:06.860 --> 00:12:06.870
content of our language in many ways the
 

00:12:06.870 --> 00:12:08.030
content of our language in many ways the
right brain on the other hand is quite

00:12:08.030 --> 00:12:08.040
right brain on the other hand is quite
 

00:12:08.040 --> 00:12:09.920
right brain on the other hand is quite
concrete and so I think the story is

00:12:09.920 --> 00:12:09.930
concrete and so I think the story is
 

00:12:09.930 --> 00:12:11.480
concrete and so I think the story is
more complicated and I think these

00:12:11.480 --> 00:12:11.490
more complicated and I think these
 

00:12:11.490 --> 00:12:12.860
more complicated and I think these
cultural ideas about left brain and

00:12:12.860 --> 00:12:12.870
cultural ideas about left brain and
 

00:12:12.870 --> 00:12:14.450
cultural ideas about left brain and
right brain have basically blown up all

00:12:14.450 --> 00:12:14.460
right brain have basically blown up all
 

00:12:14.460 --> 00:12:16.820
right brain have basically blown up all
out of proportion to to what scientists

00:12:16.820 --> 00:12:16.830
out of proportion to to what scientists
 

00:12:16.830 --> 00:12:18.290
out of proportion to to what scientists
have actually found about the left and

00:12:18.290 --> 00:12:18.300
have actually found about the left and
 

00:12:18.300 --> 00:12:22.240
have actually found about the left and
right brain

00:12:22.240 --> 00:12:22.250
 

00:12:22.250 --> 00:12:24.579
the question of nature and nurture is I

00:12:24.579 --> 00:12:24.589
the question of nature and nurture is I
 

00:12:24.589 --> 00:12:27.009
the question of nature and nurture is I
wouldn't call it settled but I would put

00:12:27.009 --> 00:12:27.019
wouldn't call it settled but I would put
 

00:12:27.019 --> 00:12:29.590
wouldn't call it settled but I would put
it like this we are all born with the

00:12:29.590 --> 00:12:29.600
it like this we are all born with the
 

00:12:29.600 --> 00:12:31.600
it like this we are all born with the
genetic inheritance and that genetic

00:12:31.600 --> 00:12:31.610
genetic inheritance and that genetic
 

00:12:31.610 --> 00:12:34.660
genetic inheritance and that genetic
inheritance sets boundaries on what we

00:12:34.660 --> 00:12:34.670
inheritance sets boundaries on what we
 

00:12:34.670 --> 00:12:37.660
inheritance sets boundaries on what we
might become it they guide us in the

00:12:37.660 --> 00:12:37.670
might become it they guide us in the
 

00:12:37.670 --> 00:12:40.809
might become it they guide us in the
sense of establishing about one-quarter

00:12:40.809 --> 00:12:40.819
sense of establishing about one-quarter
 

00:12:40.819 --> 00:12:42.550
sense of establishing about one-quarter
of the variation of what we might become

00:12:42.550 --> 00:12:42.560
of the variation of what we might become
 

00:12:42.560 --> 00:12:44.679
of the variation of what we might become
and that when it comes to intelligence

00:12:44.679 --> 00:12:44.689
and that when it comes to intelligence
 

00:12:44.689 --> 00:12:47.470
and that when it comes to intelligence
or personality it's some minority of

00:12:47.470 --> 00:12:47.480
or personality it's some minority of
 

00:12:47.480 --> 00:12:49.689
or personality it's some minority of
what we could become and then against

00:12:49.689 --> 00:12:49.699
what we could become and then against
 

00:12:49.699 --> 00:12:51.819
what we could become and then against
that genetic background then our

00:12:51.819 --> 00:12:51.829
that genetic background then our
 

00:12:51.829 --> 00:12:54.550
that genetic background then our
genetics and environment the experiences

00:12:54.550 --> 00:12:54.560
genetics and environment the experiences
 

00:12:54.560 --> 00:12:56.290
genetics and environment the experiences
that we have and the nutrition that we

00:12:56.290 --> 00:12:56.300
that we have and the nutrition that we
 

00:12:56.300 --> 00:12:58.629
that we have and the nutrition that we
get interact with one another and that

00:12:58.629 --> 00:12:58.639
get interact with one another and that
 

00:12:58.639 --> 00:13:00.009
get interact with one another and that
then shapes us over the course of

00:13:00.009 --> 00:13:00.019
then shapes us over the course of
 

00:13:00.019 --> 00:13:02.860
then shapes us over the course of
childhood and a lifetime and so most of

00:13:02.860 --> 00:13:02.870
childhood and a lifetime and so most of
 

00:13:02.870 --> 00:13:06.280
childhood and a lifetime and so most of
the variation is so most of the

00:13:06.280 --> 00:13:06.290
the variation is so most of the
 

00:13:06.290 --> 00:13:08.949
the variation is so most of the
variation turns out to be believed to be

00:13:08.949 --> 00:13:08.959
variation turns out to be believed to be
 

00:13:08.959 --> 00:13:11.199
variation turns out to be believed to be
environmentally induced or you know

00:13:11.199 --> 00:13:11.209
environmentally induced or you know
 

00:13:11.209 --> 00:13:13.389
environmentally induced or you know
based on experience and so it's some

00:13:13.389 --> 00:13:13.399
based on experience and so it's some
 

00:13:13.399 --> 00:13:15.040
based on experience and so it's some
interplay between the two that makes us

00:13:15.040 --> 00:13:15.050
interplay between the two that makes us
 

00:13:15.050 --> 00:13:18.270
interplay between the two that makes us
who we are

00:13:18.270 --> 00:13:18.280
 

00:13:18.280 --> 00:13:20.220
one thing that's interesting about child

00:13:20.220 --> 00:13:20.230
one thing that's interesting about child
 

00:13:20.230 --> 00:13:22.290
one thing that's interesting about child
development is that so much of it there

00:13:22.290 --> 00:13:22.300
development is that so much of it there
 

00:13:22.300 --> 00:13:23.640
development is that so much of it there
are so many changes that take place in

00:13:23.640 --> 00:13:23.650
are so many changes that take place in
 

00:13:23.650 --> 00:13:29.670
are so many changes that take place in
children's brains not only from birth to

00:13:29.670 --> 00:13:29.680
children's brains not only from birth to
 

00:13:29.680 --> 00:13:31.590
children's brains not only from birth to
the age of six is when people think of

00:13:31.590 --> 00:13:31.600
the age of six is when people think of
 

00:13:31.600 --> 00:13:33.300
the age of six is when people think of
brain change but also even through

00:13:33.300 --> 00:13:33.310
brain change but also even through
 

00:13:33.310 --> 00:13:37.560
brain change but also even through
childhood and into adolescence so one

00:13:37.560 --> 00:13:37.570
childhood and into adolescence so one
 

00:13:37.570 --> 00:13:39.360
childhood and into adolescence so one
thing that probably does not help is

00:13:39.360 --> 00:13:39.370
thing that probably does not help is
 

00:13:39.370 --> 00:13:41.700
thing that probably does not help is
passive experiences for the child and

00:13:41.700 --> 00:13:41.710
passive experiences for the child and
 

00:13:41.710 --> 00:13:43.020
passive experiences for the child and
the classic example of this is the

00:13:43.020 --> 00:13:43.030
the classic example of this is the
 

00:13:43.030 --> 00:13:44.640
the classic example of this is the
Mozart myth the idea that playing Mozart

00:13:44.640 --> 00:13:44.650
Mozart myth the idea that playing Mozart
 

00:13:44.650 --> 00:13:46.950
Mozart myth the idea that playing Mozart
or the classical music to a baby will

00:13:46.950 --> 00:13:46.960
or the classical music to a baby will
 

00:13:46.960 --> 00:13:48.870
or the classical music to a baby will
make the child smarter what seems to be

00:13:48.870 --> 00:13:48.880
make the child smarter what seems to be
 

00:13:48.880 --> 00:13:51.180
make the child smarter what seems to be
important is active engagement so for

which is just the hard work of having
all that information on hand and

00:14:49.480 --> 00:14:51.479
developing expertise through thousands
and thousands of hours of practice we

00:14:51.479 --> 00:14:51.489
and thousands of hours of practice we
 

00:14:51.489 --> 00:14:53.909

dumber well look if Google removes the
need for us to have all that knowledge

00:14:58.590 --> 00:14:58.600
need for us to have all that knowledge
 

00:14:58.600 --> 00:14:59.280
need for us to have all that knowledge
on hand

00:14:59.280 --> 00:14:59.290
on hand
 

00:14:59.290 --> 00:15:02.340
on hand
and then that removes us from us the

00:15:02.340 --> 00:15:02.350
and then that removes us from us the
 

00:15:02.350 --> 00:15:04.109
and then that removes us from us the

00:15:04.109 --> 00:15:04.119
ability to have these facts in our heads
 

00:15:04.119 --> 00:15:06.479
ability to have these facts in our heads
on hand and so I think that this is one

00:15:06.489 --> 00:15:08.249

as we get older omega-3 fatty acids are

00:20:45.390 --> 00:20:45.400
as we get older omega-3 fatty acids are

as we get older omega-3 fatty acids are
good for both the heart and for the

good for both the heart and for the
 

00:20:46.690 --> 00:20:48.720
good for both the heart and for the
brain and in fact I myself take omega-3

think one major mechanism that is worth
 

00:21:13.600 --> 00:21:15.690
think one major mechanism that is worth
thinking about is the idea that these

thinking about is the idea that these
 

00:21:15.700 --> 00:21:18.210
thinking about is the idea that these
therapies reduce stress one thing that

00:21:18.210 --> 00:21:18.220
therapies reduce stress one thing that
 

00:21:18.220 --> 00:21:19.680
therapies reduce stress one thing that
has been demonstrated is that stress

00:21:19.680 --> 00:21:19.690
has been demonstrated is that stress
 

00:21:19.690 --> 00:21:21.600
has been demonstrated is that stress
hormones are bad for the brain so for

instance sleep deprivation leads to the
 

00:21:23.770 --> 00:21:26.970
instance sleep deprivation leads to the
secretion of stress hormones being in

00:21:26.970 --> 00:21:26.980
secretion of stress hormones being in
 

00:21:26.980 --> 00:21:31.790

danger I mean stress stress hormones are

00:21:31.790 --> 00:21:31.800
danger I mean stress stress hormones are
 

00:21:31.800 --> 00:21:33.930
danger I mean stress stress hormones are
stress hormones arose on the stress

00:21:33.930 --> 00:21:33.940

something that's caught your attention

00:21:40.650 --> 00:21:40.660
something that's caught your attention
 

00:21:40.660 --> 00:21:43.290
something that's caught your attention
and you need to get away from it the

00:21:43.290 --> 00:21:43.300
and you need to get away from it the
 

00:21:43.300 --> 00:21:46.110
and you need to get away from it the
idea is that you're certain systems in

00:21:46.110 --> 00:21:46.120
idea is that you're certain systems in

your body shut down like your immune
 

00:21:47.560 --> 00:21:49.410
your body shut down like your immune
response and the idea is that you got to

00:21:49.410 --> 00:21:49.420
response and the idea is that you got to
 

00:21:49.420 --> 00:21:51.150
response and the idea is that you got to
shut down the unnecessary things so you

00:21:51.150 --> 00:21:51.160
shut down the unnecessary things so you
 

00:21:51.160 --> 00:21:53.250
shut down the unnecessary things so you
can get it away from danger quickly so

00:21:53.250 --> 00:21:53.260
can get it away from danger quickly so
 

00:21:53.260 --> 00:21:54.620
can get it away from danger quickly so
that's the normal biological

00:21:54.620 --> 00:21:54.630
that's the normal biological

evolutionary history of stress hormones
but now in modern times we have

situations in which stress is always
 

00:22:00.850 --> 00:22:03.450
situations in which stress is always
present and so one major way that these

00:24:13.530 --> 00:24:15.830
they're also secreted when we feel
feelings of love towards a child so for

00:24:15.830 --> 00:24:15.840
feelings of love towards a child so for
 

00:24:15.840 --> 00:24:18.440
feelings of love towards a child so for
instance mothers when they hear their

00:24:18.440 --> 00:24:18.450
instance mothers when they hear their
 

00:24:18.450 --> 00:24:21.049
instance mothers when they hear their
baby cry will feel their milk drop and

00:24:21.049 --> 00:24:21.059
baby cry will feel their milk drop and
 

00:24:21.059 --> 00:24:22.910
baby cry will feel their milk drop and
the mechanism of that is the secretion

00:24:22.910 --> 00:24:22.920
the mechanism of that is the secretion
 

00:24:22.920 --> 00:24:26.090
the mechanism of that is the secretion
of these molecules to cause milk to be

00:24:26.090 --> 00:24:26.100
of these molecules to cause milk to be
 

00:24:26.100 --> 00:24:29.390
of these molecules to cause milk to be
secreted and so it's possible to to

00:24:29.390 --> 00:24:29.400
secreted and so it's possible to to
 

00:24:29.400 --> 00:24:32.210
secreted and so it's possible to to
reproduce feelings like that those same

00:24:32.210 --> 00:24:32.220
reproduce feelings like that those same
 

00:24:32.220 --> 00:24:33.950
reproduce feelings like that those same
signaling molecules are also important

00:24:33.950 --> 00:24:33.960
signaling molecules are also important
 

00:24:33.960 --> 00:24:36.320
signaling molecules are also important
in generating a feeling of trust so for

00:24:36.320 --> 00:24:36.330
in generating a feeling of trust so for
 

00:24:36.330 --> 00:24:37.970
in generating a feeling of trust so for
instance people who take oxytocin in the

00:24:37.970 --> 00:24:37.980
instance people who take oxytocin in the
 

00:24:37.980 --> 00:24:41.150

form of a nasal spray exert more express
more trust when playing some negotiating

00:24:42.919 --> 00:24:42.929
more trust when playing some negotiating
 

00:24:42.929 --> 00:24:44.960
more trust when playing some negotiating
game with somebody and so now we're

00:24:44.960 --> 00:24:44.970
game with somebody and so now we're
 

00:24:44.970 --> 00:24:47.060
game with somebody and so now we're
talking about molecules that can affect

00:24:47.060 --> 00:24:47.070
talking about molecules that can affect
 

00:24:47.070 --> 00:24:49.190
talking about molecules that can affect
our emotional responses to other people

00:24:49.190 --> 00:24:49.200
our emotional responses to other people
 

00:24:49.200 --> 00:24:52.280
our emotional responses to other people
and that seems to cut somewhere to the

00:24:52.280 --> 00:24:52.290
and that seems to cut somewhere to the
 

00:24:52.290 --> 00:24:54.830
and that seems to cut somewhere to the
heart of what it means to be loving or

00:24:54.830 --> 00:24:54.840
heart of what it means to be loving or
 

00:24:54.840 --> 00:24:57.990

there's a subjective report that that
meditators report right feelings of

00:25:03.149 --> 00:25:03.159
meditators report right feelings of
 

00:25:03.159 --> 00:25:05.220
meditators report right feelings of
peace feelings in being able to focus

00:25:05.220 --> 00:25:05.230
peace feelings in being able to focus
 

00:25:05.230 --> 00:25:07.830

there are many versions of meditation

00:25:07.830 --> 00:25:07.840
there are many versions of meditation
 

00:25:07.840 --> 00:25:09.659
there are many versions of meditation
and the version of meditation people

practice leads to different effects so

00:25:11.249 --> 00:25:11.259
practice leads to different effects so
 

00:25:11.259 --> 00:25:13.529
practice leads to different effects so
for instance Buddhists report a

00:25:13.529 --> 00:25:13.539
for instance Buddhists report a
 

00:25:13.539 --> 00:25:15.869
for instance Buddhists report a
particular state of object less

00:25:15.869 --> 00:25:15.879

to see what happens in their brains it's
 

00:25:28.899 --> 00:25:31.080
to see what happens in their brains it's
possible to measure very large

object list compassion state and what's

00:25:43.440 --> 00:25:43.450
object list compassion state and what's
 

00:25:43.450 --> 00:25:44.700
object list compassion state and what's
observed is that you can see these

00:25:44.700 --> 00:25:44.710
observed is that you can see these
 

00:25:44.710 --> 00:25:48.930
observed is that you can see these
oscillations which basically are the

00:25:48.930 --> 00:25:48.940
oscillations which basically are the
 

00:25:48.940 --> 00:25:51.389

the gamma frequency band that's only

00:26:02.249 --> 00:26:02.259
the gamma frequency band that's only
 

00:26:02.259 --> 00:26:04.200
the gamma frequency band that's only
found in non expert meditators when

00:26:04.200 --> 00:26:04.210
found in non expert meditators when
 

00:26:04.210 --> 00:26:05.999

people can do something extreme with

00:26:07.740 --> 00:26:07.750
people can do something extreme with
 

00:26:07.750 --> 00:26:10.230
people can do something extreme with
their brains and I'm not sure that it

00:26:10.230 --> 00:26:10.240
their brains and I'm not sure that it
 

00:26:10.240 --> 00:26:13.070
their brains and I'm not sure that it
reveals anything about the nature of

00:26:13.070 --> 00:26:13.080
reveals anything about the nature of
 

00:26:13.080 --> 00:26:15.269
reveals anything about the nature of
reaching enlightenment or the benefits

00:26:15.269 --> 00:26:15.279
reaching enlightenment or the benefits
 

00:26:15.279 --> 00:26:16.499
reaching enlightenment or the benefits
of meditation but I think the one thing

00:26:16.499 --> 00:26:16.509
of meditation but I think the one thing
 

00:26:16.509 --> 00:26:17.850
of meditation but I think the one thing
that's very interesting about it is

00:26:17.850 --> 00:26:17.860
that's very interesting about it is
 

00:26:17.860 --> 00:26:20.190
that's very interesting about it is
finding a neural signature that shows

trained when people learn to be very
 

00:26:23.470 --> 00:26:24.749
trained when people learn to be very
good at these things and I think that

00:26:24.749 --> 00:26:24.759
good at these things and I think that
 

00:26:24.759 --> 00:26:27.019
good at these things and I think that
scientifically that's a rich source of

00:26:27.019 --> 00:26:27.029
scientifically that's a rich source of
 

00:26:27.029 --> 00:26:31.860
scientifically that's a rich source of
questions for investigation

00:26:31.860 --> 00:26:31.870
 

00:26:31.870 --> 00:26:34.470
our brains abilities to think about and

00:26:34.470 --> 00:26:34.480
our brains abilities to think about and
 

00:26:34.480 --> 00:26:36.600
our brains abilities to think about and
model the world or double-edged more

00:26:36.600 --> 00:26:36.610

00:26:36.610 --> 00:26:38.430
model the world or double-edged more
than any other animal we have the

00:26:38.430 --> 00:26:38.440
than any other animal we have the
 

00:26:38.440 --> 00:26:40.409
than any other animal we have the
capability it seems to look into the

00:26:40.409 --> 00:26:40.419
capability it seems to look into the
 

00:26:40.419 --> 00:26:41.700
capability it seems to look into the
future and to make plans for the future

00:26:41.700 --> 00:26:41.710
future and to make plans for the future
 

00:26:41.710 --> 00:26:43.919
future and to make plans for the future
and that's basically cuz we've got those

00:26:43.919 --> 00:26:43.929
and that's basically cuz we've got those
 

00:26:43.929 --> 00:26:45.450
and that's basically cuz we've got those

tremendous cortex especially a
prefrontal cortex that allows us to make

00:26:47.580 --> 00:26:47.590
prefrontal cortex that allows us to make
 

00:26:47.590 --> 00:26:49.470
prefrontal cortex that allows us to make
these plans for the future but at the

00:26:49.470 --> 00:26:49.480
these plans for the future but at the
 

00:26:49.480 --> 00:26:52.310
these plans for the future but at the
same time we are also limited we are

00:26:52.310 --> 00:26:52.320
same time we are also limited we are
 

00:26:52.320 --> 00:26:55.470
same time we are also limited we are
remarkably bad at seeing the downstream

five years or ten years down the road
 

00:26:59.380 --> 00:27:03.230
five years or ten years down the road
we're just not very good at that and so

00:27:03.230 --> 00:27:03.240
we're just not very good at that and so
 

00:27:03.240 --> 00:27:05.639
we're just not very good at that and so
it's difficult to judge whether

00:27:05.639 --> 00:27:05.649
it's difficult to judge whether
 

00:27:05.649 --> 00:27:07.289
it's difficult to judge whether
something some life decision you make

00:27:07.289 --> 00:27:07.299
something some life decision you make
 

00:27:07.299 --> 00:27:08.639
something some life decision you make
today will make you happy a few years

00:27:08.639 --> 00:27:08.649
today will make you happy a few years
 

00:27:08.649 --> 00:27:12.450
today will make you happy a few years
down the road one way to get around that

00:27:12.450 --> 00:27:12.460
down the road one way to get around that
 

00:27:12.460 --> 00:27:15.120
down the road one way to get around that
is to simply find someone who was faced

00:27:15.120 --> 00:27:15.130
is to simply find someone who was faced
 

00:27:15.130 --> 00:27:16.620
is to simply find someone who was faced
with the same decision a few years down

00:27:16.620 --> 00:27:16.630
with the same decision a few years down
 

00:27:16.630 --> 00:27:19.440
with the same decision a few years down
the road a few years in the past and ask

00:27:19.440 --> 00:27:19.450
the road a few years in the past and ask
 

00:27:19.450 --> 00:27:21.240
the road a few years in the past and ask
them well how did you feel after making

00:27:21.240 --> 00:27:21.250
them well how did you feel after making
 

00:27:21.250 --> 00:27:23.010
them well how did you feel after making
that decision and so one thing you can

00:27:23.010 --> 00:27:23.020
that decision and so one thing you can
 

00:27:23.020 --> 00:27:24.419
that decision and so one thing you can
do is to find people who faced with the

00:27:24.419 --> 00:27:24.429
do is to find people who faced with the
 

00:27:24.429 --> 00:27:26.370
do is to find people who faced with the
same challenge and the make and report

00:27:26.370 --> 00:27:26.380
same challenge and the make and report
 

00:27:26.380 --> 00:27:28.169
same challenge and the make and report
accurately how it made them happy or

00:27:28.169 --> 00:27:28.179
accurately how it made them happy or
 

00:27:28.179 --> 00:27:31.409
accurately how it made them happy or
unhappy one thing about happiness that's

00:27:31.409 --> 00:27:31.419
unhappy one thing about happiness that's
 

00:27:31.419 --> 00:27:33.600
unhappy one thing about happiness that's
funny is that we are remarkably

00:27:33.600 --> 00:27:33.610
funny is that we are remarkably
 

00:27:33.610 --> 00:27:36.029
funny is that we are remarkably
resilient in adapting to events so you

00:27:36.029 --> 00:27:36.039
resilient in adapting to events so you
 

00:27:36.039 --> 00:27:39.330
resilient in adapting to events so you
might imagine that that's something like

00:27:39.330 --> 00:27:39.340
might imagine that that's something like
 

00:27:39.340 --> 00:27:41.159
might imagine that that's something like
losing a limb would really affect what's

00:27:41.159 --> 00:27:41.169
losing a limb would really affect what's
 

00:27:41.169 --> 00:27:43.110
losing a limb would really affect what's
happiness but studies have shown that

00:27:43.110 --> 00:27:43.120
happiness but studies have shown that
 

00:27:43.120 --> 00:27:45.180
happiness but studies have shown that
losing a limb causes it you know you're

00:27:45.180 --> 00:27:45.190

after a few years you adapt out and it's
 

00:27:49.539 --> 00:27:52.169

kind of autism spectrum disorder is
between 50 and 80 percent and that's

the wrong combination of genes say
between two and ten genes then that

between two and ten genes then that
 

00:30:08.659 --> 00:30:11.200

increases the risk of being autistic so

00:30:11.200 --> 00:30:11.210
increases the risk of being autistic so
 

00:30:11.210 --> 00:30:12.999
increases the risk of being autistic so
that's the main thing that's known as

look at structural differences between
 

00:30:21.139 --> 00:30:23.200
look at structural differences between
the brains of autistic people and what

00:30:23.200 --> 00:30:23.210
the brains of autistic people and what
 

00:30:23.210 --> 00:30:25.330
the brains of autistic people and what
are called neurotypical people and those

00:30:25.330 --> 00:30:25.340
are called neurotypical people and those
 

00:30:25.340 --> 00:30:27.070
are called neurotypical people and those
are changes that take place in the

00:30:27.070 --> 00:30:27.080
are changes that take place in the
 

00:30:27.080 --> 00:30:28.990
are changes that take place in the
neocortex which is the largest part of

00:30:28.990 --> 00:30:29.000
neocortex which is the largest part of
 

00:30:29.000 --> 00:30:31.090
neocortex which is the largest part of
our brain and also in the cerebellum

00:30:31.090 --> 00:30:31.100
our brain and also in the cerebellum
 

00:30:31.100 --> 00:30:33.190

which people used to think of as being a

00:30:33.190 --> 00:30:33.200
which people used to think of as being a
 

00:30:33.200 --> 00:30:35.259
which people used to think of as being a
sensory or motor structure but seems to

00:30:35.259 --> 00:30:35.269
sensory or motor structure but seems to
 

00:30:35.269 --> 00:30:37.389
sensory or motor structure but seems to
be perhaps important also for for more

00:30:37.389 --> 00:30:37.399
be perhaps important also for for more
 

00:30:37.399 --> 00:30:39.399
be perhaps important also for for more
advanced cognitive tasks and so the

00:30:39.399 --> 00:30:39.409
advanced cognitive tasks and so the
 

00:30:39.409 --> 00:30:41.409
advanced cognitive tasks and so the
cerebellum as has been fingered in the

00:30:41.409 --> 00:30:41.419
cerebellum as has been fingered in the
 

00:30:41.419 --> 00:30:43.480
cerebellum as has been fingered in the
last few years as far as treatments for

00:30:43.480 --> 00:30:43.490
last few years as far as treatments for
 

00:30:43.490 --> 00:30:45.549
last few years as far as treatments for
autism right now the one kind of

00:30:45.549 --> 00:30:45.559
autism right now the one kind of
 

00:30:45.559 --> 00:30:46.749
autism right now the one kind of
treatment that seems to be somewhat

00:30:46.749 --> 00:30:46.759
treatment that seems to be somewhat
 

00:30:46.759 --> 00:30:48.970
treatment that seems to be somewhat
helpful is behavioral therapy especially

00:30:48.970 --> 00:30:48.980
helpful is behavioral therapy especially
 

00:30:48.980 --> 00:30:51.070
helpful is behavioral therapy especially
when children are diagnosed and

00:30:51.070 --> 00:30:51.080
when children are diagnosed and
 

00:30:51.080 --> 00:30:53.139
when children are diagnosed and
identified as needing the help young and

00:30:53.139 --> 00:30:53.149
identified as needing the help young and
 

00:30:53.149 --> 00:30:56.379
identified as needing the help young and
so that is interesting because it's the

00:30:56.379 --> 00:30:56.389
so that is interesting because it's the
 

00:30:56.389 --> 00:30:58.450
so that is interesting because it's the
one way that seems to possibly help kids

who have autism and it may be part of

why diagnosis rates have gone up because

00:31:03.549 --> 00:31:03.559
why diagnosis rates have gone up because
 

00:31:03.559 --> 00:31:05.919
why diagnosis rates have gone up because
it's recognized that those therapies can

it's recognized that those therapies can
 

00:31:05.929 --> 00:31:08.139
it's recognized that those therapies can
help kids and so people are motivated to

00:31:08.139 --> 00:31:08.149
help kids and so people are motivated to
 

00:31:08.149 --> 00:31:10.090
help kids and so people are motivated to
identify these problems and their kids

00:31:10.090 --> 00:31:10.100
identify these problems and their kids
 

00:31:10.100 --> 00:31:11.799
identify these problems and their kids
when they're young because that's when

00:31:11.799 --> 00:31:11.809
when they're young because that's when
 

00:31:11.809 --> 00:31:13.960

it's possible to maybe catch these

it's possible to maybe catch these

it's possible to maybe catch these
things and

things and
 

00:31:14.780 --> 00:31:17.050
things and
help these kids integrate better into

00:31:17.050 --> 00:31:17.060
help these kids integrate better into
 

00:31:17.060 --> 00:31:21.220

one characteristic of autism therapy in
the last few years has been basically

the last few years has been basically

the last few years has been basically
taking autistic kids and seeing what can

00:31:28.450 --> 00:31:28.460
taking autistic kids and seeing what can
 

00:31:28.460 --> 00:31:30.190
taking autistic kids and seeing what can
be done to help them and I think that's

00:31:30.190 --> 00:31:30.200
be done to help them and I think that's
 

00:31:30.200 --> 00:31:33.580
be done to help them and I think that's
sort of I wouldn't call it palliative

00:31:33.580 --> 00:31:33.590
sort of I wouldn't call it palliative
 

00:31:33.590 --> 00:31:37.800
sort of I wouldn't call it palliative
but it's it's in the category of helping

then it's a question of what you can do

00:34:34.119 --> 00:34:34.129
because being educated gives you the
 

00:34:34.129 --> 00:34:35.859
because being educated gives you the
tools to lead a more engaged life or

00:34:35.859 --> 00:34:35.869
tools to lead a more engaged life or
 

00:34:35.869 --> 00:34:37.269
tools to lead a more engaged life or
whether or maybe if you're a more

00:34:37.269 --> 00:34:37.279
whether or maybe if you're a more
 

00:34:37.279 --> 00:34:39.190
whether or maybe if you're a more
intellectually engaged engaged person

00:34:39.190 --> 00:34:39.200
intellectually engaged engaged person
 

00:34:39.200 --> 00:34:41.049
intellectually engaged engaged person
you might be the kind of person who

00:34:41.049 --> 00:34:41.059
you might be the kind of person who
 

00:34:41.059 --> 00:34:42.430
you might be the kind of person who
would go to college and graduate school

00:34:42.430 --> 00:34:42.440
would go to college and graduate school
 

00:34:42.440 --> 00:34:43.809
would go to college and graduate school
so it's not you know it's a chicken-egg

00:34:43.809 --> 00:34:43.819
so it's not you know it's a chicken-egg
 

00:34:43.819 --> 00:34:46.180
so it's not you know it's a chicken-egg
problem but in either case that's the

00:34:46.180 --> 00:34:46.190
problem but in either case that's the
 

00:34:46.190 --> 00:34:48.779
problem but in either case that's the
number one correlate in general

00:34:48.779 --> 00:34:48.789
number one correlate in general
 

00:34:48.789 --> 00:34:51.490
number one correlate in general
individual tasks that you learn when you

00:34:51.490 --> 00:34:51.500
individual tasks that you learn when you
 

00:34:51.500 --> 00:34:53.470
individual tasks that you learn when you
play brain games and you go to brain

00:34:53.470 --> 00:34:53.480
play brain games and you go to brain
 

00:34:53.480 --> 00:34:56.019
play brain games and you go to brain
gyms tend to only increase your capacity

00:34:56.019 --> 00:34:56.029
gyms tend to only increase your capacity
 

00:34:56.029 --> 00:34:59.890
gyms tend to only increase your capacity
at that particular task or tasks as that

00:34:59.890 --> 00:34:59.900
at that particular task or tasks as that
 

00:34:59.900 --> 00:35:01.750
at that particular task or tasks as that
type and they tend to lead to small

00:35:01.750 --> 00:35:01.760
type and they tend to lead to small
 

00:35:01.760 --> 00:35:03.849
type and they tend to lead to small
benefits and so I think a lot of these

00:35:03.849 --> 00:35:03.859
benefits and so I think a lot of these
 

00:35:03.859 --> 00:35:05.740
benefits and so I think a lot of these
exercises don't lead to large benefits

00:35:05.740 --> 00:35:05.750
exercises don't lead to large benefits
 

00:35:05.750 --> 00:35:07.839
exercises don't lead to large benefits
now it could be that doing a lot of

00:35:07.839 --> 00:35:07.849
now it could be that doing a lot of
 

00:35:07.849 --> 00:35:09.490
now it could be that doing a lot of
these different things is something like

00:35:09.490 --> 00:35:09.500
these different things is something like
 

00:35:09.500 --> 00:35:11.109
these different things is something like
a full body workout then it could be

00:35:11.109 --> 00:35:11.119
a full body workout then it could be
 

00:35:11.119 --> 00:35:13.240
a full body workout then it could be
that there's some moderate benefit but I

00:35:13.240 --> 00:35:13.250
that there's some moderate benefit but I
 

00:35:13.250 --> 00:35:14.920
that there's some moderate benefit but I
think the people who go to those should

00:35:14.920 --> 00:35:14.930
think the people who go to those should
 

00:35:14.930 --> 00:35:16.809
think the people who go to those should
really remember not only the

00:35:16.809 --> 00:35:16.819
really remember not only the
 

00:35:16.819 --> 00:35:19.539
really remember not only the
intellectual principle right a sound

00:35:19.539 --> 00:35:19.549
intellectual principle right a sound
 

00:35:19.549 --> 00:35:21.789
intellectual principle right a sound
mind but also the sound body principle

00:35:21.789 --> 00:35:21.799
mind but also the sound body principle
 

00:35:21.799 --> 00:35:23.710
mind but also the sound body principle
and so I think any such gym should

00:35:23.710 --> 00:35:23.720
and so I think any such gym should
 

00:35:23.720 --> 00:35:25.180
and so I think any such gym should
include what we talked about earlier

00:35:25.180 --> 00:35:25.190
include what we talked about earlier
 

00:35:25.190 --> 00:35:29.080
include what we talked about earlier
fitness training

00:35:29.080 --> 00:35:29.090
 

00:35:29.090 --> 00:35:30.940
so there are different kinds of

00:35:30.940 --> 00:35:30.950
so there are different kinds of
 

00:35:30.950 --> 00:35:32.380
so there are different kinds of
cognitive and memory loss that occur

00:35:32.380 --> 00:35:32.390
cognitive and memory loss that occur
 

00:35:32.390 --> 00:35:34.870
cognitive and memory loss that occur
with aging certain kinds of memory loss

00:35:34.870 --> 00:35:34.880
with aging certain kinds of memory loss
 

00:35:34.880 --> 00:35:38.170
with aging certain kinds of memory loss
are such as forgetting where your car

00:35:38.170 --> 00:35:38.180
are such as forgetting where your car
 

00:35:38.180 --> 00:35:40.240
are such as forgetting where your car
keys are are part of the normal process

00:35:40.240 --> 00:35:40.250
keys are are part of the normal process
 

00:35:40.250 --> 00:35:42.160
keys are are part of the normal process
of getting older and in fact memory

00:35:42.160 --> 00:35:42.170
of getting older and in fact memory
 

00:35:42.170 --> 00:35:43.930
of getting older and in fact memory
Peaks surprisingly early at the age of

00:35:43.930 --> 00:35:43.940
Peaks surprisingly early at the age of
 

00:35:43.940 --> 00:35:46.090
Peaks surprisingly early at the age of
30 and then declines gradually with time

00:35:46.090 --> 00:35:46.100
30 and then declines gradually with time
 

00:35:46.100 --> 00:35:48.820
30 and then declines gradually with time
so forgetting where your keys are is not

00:35:48.820 --> 00:35:48.830
so forgetting where your keys are is not
 

00:35:48.830 --> 00:35:52.030
so forgetting where your keys are is not
a cause of particular concern and then

00:35:52.030 --> 00:35:52.040
a cause of particular concern and then
 

00:35:52.040 --> 00:35:54.040
a cause of particular concern and then
there's dementia which is forgetting say

00:35:54.040 --> 00:35:54.050
there's dementia which is forgetting say
 

00:35:54.050 --> 00:35:57.160
there's dementia which is forgetting say
that you you know like the the old saw

00:35:57.160 --> 00:35:57.170
that you you know like the the old saw
 

00:35:57.170 --> 00:35:58.930
that you you know like the the old saw
goes that if you forget where your

00:35:58.930 --> 00:35:58.940
goes that if you forget where your
 

00:35:58.940 --> 00:36:01.030
goes that if you forget where your
glasses are that's normal memory loss if

00:36:01.030 --> 00:36:01.040
glasses are that's normal memory loss if
 

00:36:01.040 --> 00:36:02.410
glasses are that's normal memory loss if
you forget the fact that you wear

00:36:02.410 --> 00:36:02.420
you forget the fact that you wear
 

00:36:02.420 --> 00:36:02.920
you forget the fact that you wear
glasses

00:36:02.920 --> 00:36:02.930
glasses
 

00:36:02.930 --> 00:36:04.930
glasses
that's dementia and so there are

00:36:04.930 --> 00:36:04.940
that's dementia and so there are
 

00:36:04.940 --> 00:36:07.180
that's dementia and so there are
different degrees of this so just normal

00:36:07.180 --> 00:36:07.190
different degrees of this so just normal
 

00:36:07.190 --> 00:36:08.970
different degrees of this so just normal
memory loss is not a cause of concern

00:36:08.970 --> 00:36:08.980
memory loss is not a cause of concern
 

00:36:08.980 --> 00:36:11.440
memory loss is not a cause of concern
it's not well understood exactly what

00:36:11.440 --> 00:36:11.450
it's not well understood exactly what
 

00:36:11.450 --> 00:36:13.180
it's not well understood exactly what
physically underlies this

00:36:13.180 --> 00:36:13.190
physically underlies this
 

00:36:13.190 --> 00:36:16.390
physically underlies this
although plausible candidates are loss

00:36:16.390 --> 00:36:16.400
although plausible candidates are loss
 

00:36:16.400 --> 00:36:18.010
although plausible candidates are loss
of the brain's ability to form new

00:36:18.010 --> 00:36:18.020
of the brain's ability to form new
 

00:36:18.020 --> 00:36:22.690
of the brain's ability to form new
connections or to easily modulate the

00:36:22.690 --> 00:36:22.700
connections or to easily modulate the
 

00:36:22.700 --> 00:36:24.130
connections or to easily modulate the
weight of the connections between nerve

00:36:24.130 --> 00:36:24.140
weight of the connections between nerve
 

00:36:24.140 --> 00:36:26.200
weight of the connections between nerve
cells those are called synaptic weights

00:36:26.200 --> 00:36:26.210
cells those are called synaptic weights
 

00:36:26.210 --> 00:36:28.210
cells those are called synaptic weights
and so those would be candidates for why

00:36:28.210 --> 00:36:28.220
and so those would be candidates for why
 

00:36:28.220 --> 00:36:30.370
and so those would be candidates for why
the brain seems to be less plastic in

the brain seems to be less plastic in
 

00:36:30.380 --> 00:36:32.830
the brain seems to be less plastic in
certain ways as we get older but it's

00:36:32.830 --> 00:36:32.840
certain ways as we get older but it's

certain ways as we get older but it's
not super well understood now there's

00:36:35.650 --> 00:36:35.660
not super well understood now there's
 

00:36:35.660 --> 00:36:38.100
not super well understood now there's
another category of memory loss this

00:36:38.100 --> 00:36:38.110
another category of memory loss this
 

00:36:38.110 --> 00:36:40.240
another category of memory loss this
severe decline in the form of dementia

00:36:40.240 --> 00:36:40.250
severe decline in the form of dementia
 

00:36:40.250 --> 00:36:42.430
severe decline in the form of dementia
and the thing that's understood there is

00:36:42.430 --> 00:36:42.440
and the thing that's understood there is
 

00:36:42.440 --> 00:36:43.900
and the thing that's understood there is
that you can look in the brains of

00:36:43.900 --> 00:36:43.910
that you can look in the brains of
 

00:36:43.910 --> 00:36:47.500
that you can look in the brains of
people who after death are diagnosed as

people who after death are diagnosed as
 

00:36:47.510 --> 00:36:49.360
people who after death are diagnosed as
having Alzheimer's disease and they have

00:36:49.360 --> 00:36:49.370
having Alzheimer's disease and they have
 

00:36:49.370 --> 00:36:51.430
having Alzheimer's disease and they have
plaques and tangles that appear to be

00:36:51.430 --> 00:36:51.440
plaques and tangles that appear to be
 

00:36:51.440 --> 00:36:53.800
plaques and tangles that appear to be
either the causes of cell death or

00:36:53.800 --> 00:36:53.810
either the causes of cell death or
 

00:36:53.810 --> 00:36:56.110
either the causes of cell death or
perhaps the residue the aftermath of

00:36:56.110 --> 00:36:56.120
perhaps the residue the aftermath of
 

00:36:56.120 --> 00:36:57.880
perhaps the residue the aftermath of
cell death and these plaques and tangles

cell death and these plaques and tangles
 

00:36:57.890 --> 00:37:01.540
cell death and these plaques and tangles
seem to be at the root of certain kinds

00:37:01.540 --> 00:37:01.550
seem to be at the root of certain kinds
 

00:37:01.550 --> 00:37:04.030
seem to be at the root of certain kinds
of of cognitive loss and that's

00:37:04.030 --> 00:37:04.040
of of cognitive loss and that's
 

00:37:04.040 --> 00:37:06.880
of of cognitive loss and that's
something that some that's studied now

00:37:06.880 --> 00:37:06.890
something that some that's studied now
 

00:37:06.890 --> 00:37:09.250
something that some that's studied now
and is a pretty active area of research

00:37:09.250 --> 00:37:09.260
and is a pretty active area of research
 

00:37:09.260 --> 00:37:11.800
and is a pretty active area of research
and the current goal is to try to find

00:37:11.800 --> 00:37:11.810
and the current goal is to try to find
 

00:37:11.810 --> 00:37:14.980
and the current goal is to try to find
ways to stave off those cognitive losses

00:37:14.980 --> 00:37:14.990
ways to stave off those cognitive losses
 

00:37:14.990 --> 00:37:17.380
ways to stave off those cognitive losses
by even a few years because as we live

00:37:17.380 --> 00:37:17.390
by even a few years because as we live

longer having a few years becomes very
 

00:37:19.970 --> 00:37:23.940
longer having a few years becomes very
important

00:37:23.940 --> 00:37:23.950
 

00:37:23.950 --> 00:37:25.860
there are two kinds of ways that

there are two kinds of ways that
neuroscience may be transforming one

00:37:27.870 --> 00:37:27.880
neuroscience may be transforming one

genetics and development can lead to the
 

00:37:44.590 --> 00:37:46.530
genetics and development can lead to the
wiring of a brain and one thing that's

00:37:46.530 --> 00:37:46.540
wiring of a brain and one thing that's
 

00:37:46.540 --> 00:37:48.990
wiring of a brain and one thing that's
become very big in the last few years is

00:37:48.990 --> 00:37:49.000
become very big in the last few years is
 

00:37:49.000 --> 00:37:51.600
become very big in the last few years is
the idea that we may start having enough

00:41:20.359 --> 00:41:20.369
of factual knowledge and I think that
 

00:41:20.369 --> 00:41:22.520
of factual knowledge and I think that
that is something that's being lost but

00:41:22.520 --> 00:41:22.530
that is something that's being lost but
 

00:41:22.530 --> 00:41:25.460
that is something that's being lost but
the thing that's gained is that at the

00:41:25.460 --> 00:41:25.470
the thing that's gained is that at the
 

00:41:25.470 --> 00:41:27.770
the thing that's gained is that at the
press of a key you can get facts and

00:41:27.770 --> 00:41:27.780
press of a key you can get facts and
 

00:41:27.780 --> 00:41:29.150
press of a key you can get facts and
start to manipulate them and turn them

00:41:29.150 --> 00:41:29.160
start to manipulate them and turn them
 

00:41:29.160 --> 00:41:31.579
start to manipulate them and turn them
to something new and so I think there's

00:41:31.579 --> 00:41:31.589
to something new and so I think there's
 

00:41:31.589 --> 00:41:32.930
to something new and so I think there's
a large gain and I don't know how to

00:41:32.930 --> 00:41:32.940
a large gain and I don't know how to
 

00:41:32.940 --> 00:41:38.099
a large gain and I don't know how to
trade off those those two things

00:41:38.099 --> 00:41:38.109
 

00:41:38.109 --> 00:41:40.450
video games have the potential for

00:41:40.450 --> 00:41:40.460
video games have the potential for
 

00:41:40.460 --> 00:41:43.510
video games have the potential for
improving cognitive function um there's

00:41:43.510 --> 00:41:43.520
improving cognitive function um there's
 

00:41:43.520 --> 00:41:44.349
improving cognitive function um there's
a researcher

00:41:44.349 --> 00:41:44.359
a researcher
 

00:41:44.359 --> 00:41:46.750

Daphne bevel here who is very interested

in the effects of video games so for

in the effects of video games so for
 

00:41:48.740 --> 00:41:50.290
in the effects of video games so for
instance one kind of thing that seems to

00:41:50.290 --> 00:41:50.300
instance one kind of thing that seems to
 

00:41:50.300 --> 00:41:53.170
instance one kind of thing that seems to
occur is that video games improve

00:41:53.170 --> 00:41:53.180
occur is that video games improve
 

00:41:53.180 --> 00:41:54.430
occur is that video games improve
hand-eye coordination and that's a

00:41:54.430 --> 00:41:54.440
hand-eye coordination and that's a
 

00:41:54.440 --> 00:41:56.589
hand-eye coordination and that's a
fairly obvious thing depending on the

00:41:56.589 --> 00:41:56.599
fairly obvious thing depending on the
 

00:41:56.599 --> 00:41:58.270
fairly obvious thing depending on the
type of video game say for instance if

00:41:58.270 --> 00:41:58.280
type of video game say for instance if
 

00:41:58.280 --> 00:42:00.790
type of video game say for instance if
it's a complex game like Sim City that

00:42:00.790 --> 00:42:00.800
it's a complex game like Sim City that
 

00:42:00.800 --> 00:42:02.560
it's a complex game like Sim City that
can lead to improvements in task

00:42:02.560 --> 00:42:02.570
can lead to improvements in task
 

00:42:02.570 --> 00:42:05.470
can lead to improvements in task
switching and so it seems likely

00:42:05.470 --> 00:42:05.480
switching and so it seems likely
 

00:42:05.480 --> 00:42:07.300
switching and so it seems likely
although I don't think it's been exactly

00:42:07.300 --> 00:42:07.310
although I don't think it's been exactly
 

00:42:07.310 --> 00:42:10.030
although I don't think it's been exactly
demonstrated it seems highly likely that

00:42:10.030 --> 00:42:10.040
demonstrated it seems highly likely that
 

00:42:10.040 --> 00:42:11.980
demonstrated it seems highly likely that
video games might improve multitasking

00:42:11.980 --> 00:42:11.990
video games might improve multitasking
 

00:42:11.990 --> 00:42:13.570
video games might improve multitasking
abilities there are limits to

00:42:13.570 --> 00:42:13.580
abilities there are limits to
 

00:42:13.580 --> 00:42:16.180
abilities there are limits to

most cases leads to decreased

most cases leads to decreased
 

00:42:18.260 --> 00:42:21.339
most cases leads to decreased
performance in both tasks but at the

00:42:21.339 --> 00:42:21.349
performance in both tasks but at the
 

00:42:21.349 --> 00:42:22.480
performance in both tasks but at the
same time it's a thing that is

00:42:22.480 --> 00:42:22.490
same time it's a thing that is
 

00:42:22.490 --> 00:42:27.310
same time it's a thing that is
potentially trainable by video games

00:42:27.310 --> 00:42:27.320
 

00:42:27.320 --> 00:42:31.300
I think that what kurtzweil does is take

I think that what kurtzweil does is take
 

00:42:31.310 --> 00:42:34.060
I think that what kurtzweil does is take

00:43:14.060 --> 00:43:16.560
too optimistic another practical problem
is that computational power is
