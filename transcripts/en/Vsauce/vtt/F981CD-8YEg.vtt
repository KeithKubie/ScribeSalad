00:00:00.429 --> 00:00:03.379
A bird house that looks like a
surveillance camera

00:00:03.379 --> 00:00:08.040
and Mister Spock-topus.
It's episode 26

00:00:08.040 --> 00:00:13.240
of LÃœT.
Now, here's a perfume designed to make you smell

00:00:13.240 --> 00:00:17.449
like a book. And Generate offers a limited edition

00:00:17.449 --> 00:00:21.340
life wall clock.
It's just like a normal clock,

00:00:21.340 --> 00:00:27.460
except slowed down by a factor of 61,320.

00:00:27.460 --> 00:00:29.960
Every number represents a year

00:00:29.960 --> 00:00:34.090
and it's meant to go around once in
the average person's life.

00:00:34.500 --> 00:00:37.500
Keep your head warm by making your own
knitted brain hat,

00:00:37.510 --> 00:00:40.790
but if you prefer ears, put some ears

00:00:40.790 --> 00:00:43.920
on your ears, or around your neck,

00:00:43.920 --> 00:00:47.000
or on your finger, or how about a mouth?

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:50.899
In fact, just get a nose ring.
No, no, no.

00:00:50.899 --> 00:00:55.050
A nose ring.
Fifty Shades of Grey

00:00:55.050 --> 00:00:58.620
Learn them. Seriously.
Here's a poster delineating

00:00:58.620 --> 00:01:02.100
fifty shades of grey.
And these plates are perfect for

00:01:02.100 --> 00:01:05.860
finger food, because they are finger sized.

00:01:06.420 --> 00:01:09.920
Now, if you're going to be making
sandwiches, use this crust cutter to turn

00:01:09.930 --> 00:01:10.810
it into two

00:01:10.810 --> 00:01:14.540
dolphins and a heart.
If it's too early for sandwiches,

00:01:14.540 --> 00:01:18.850
simply be a cereal killer.
Tuxedo

00:01:18.850 --> 00:01:24.060
ring, emoticon rings,  inflatable Cthulhu arm or

00:01:24.660 --> 00:01:27.780
or this touching little number.
Two rings

00:01:27.780 --> 00:01:31.700
that come attached at the middle.
You snap them apart, so that you and one

00:01:31.700 --> 00:01:32.619
other person

00:01:32.619 --> 00:01:36.759
have perfectly matching, unique two-of-a-kind rings.

00:01:37.600 --> 00:01:39.660
Time moves under

00:01:39.670 --> 00:01:43.040
this watch's face, crossing the red present line.

00:01:43.040 --> 00:01:46.409
Now, you can't see the future and the past is gone,

00:01:46.409 --> 00:01:50.460
faded away.
For lunch, carry your sandwiches

00:01:50.460 --> 00:01:56.799
in disguise bags. And rock in a rocking
chair designed to generate electricity

00:01:56.799 --> 00:02:00.170
while you rock ... paper, scissors

00:02:00.170 --> 00:02:04.540
necklaces are cool and sausage neck
pillows are even better.

00:02:04.540 --> 00:02:08.390
When you fall asleep, don't do it alone, with these sheets

00:02:08.390 --> 00:02:12.470
which have a fake little dog on them to
keep you company. The goofy eyes on this

00:02:12.470 --> 00:02:14.080
clock tell you the time.

00:02:14.080 --> 00:02:18.120
The one on your left looks to be hour
and the other looks at the minute.

00:02:18.120 --> 00:02:21.510
This gumball tastes like apple cobbler,

00:02:21.510 --> 00:02:24.830
but it's just the desert in your TV dinner gumset.

00:02:24.830 --> 00:02:28.459
These two are flavored like roast beef
and buttered corn.

00:02:28.459 --> 00:02:32.300
And these envelopes are fruit-flavoured,
when you lick them to stick them.

00:02:32.460 --> 00:02:35.700
Oh look, a bathroom mist designed to smell

00:02:35.709 --> 00:02:41.420
like a baby's head. Here's a special
thermally insulated bag that's great for

00:02:41.420 --> 00:02:42.209
transporting

00:02:42.209 --> 00:02:45.670
wine, but it looks like a cheap paper bag.

00:02:45.670 --> 00:02:49.269
And you can frighten people
when you sip from your cracked

00:02:49.269 --> 00:02:52.560
mug, full of death wish coffee.

00:02:52.560 --> 00:02:55.560
A special roast guaranteed to be the strongest

00:02:55.560 --> 00:02:58.819
coffee you've ever tasted.
Both in terms of flavor

00:02:58.819 --> 00:03:01.930
and caffeine content.

00:03:01.930 --> 00:03:04.980
Your iPhone can snap into this little
guy to become your pet

00:03:04.980 --> 00:03:08.379
and these urine sample bottles contain a delicious

00:03:08.379 --> 00:03:13.080
yellow liquid candy. Quiet down the
baby with a pacifiers that puts a

00:03:13.080 --> 00:03:13.860
mustache

00:03:13.860 --> 00:03:17.790
under his nose. This straw building kit
allows you to make your own custom

00:03:17.790 --> 00:03:20.129
straws for mixing and sharing drinks

00:03:20.129 --> 00:03:25.030
and these straws give you a kissy face.
Of course, make sure you're fancy

00:03:25.030 --> 00:03:28.170
and use these fine disposable paper cups.

00:03:28.170 --> 00:03:31.510
Or use an R2-D2 mug or glasses

00:03:31.510 --> 00:03:35.080
designed to express each one of the seven

00:03:35.080 --> 00:03:38.379
deadly sins.
For instance, pride,

00:03:38.379 --> 00:03:41.560
sloth,

00:03:41.560 --> 00:03:44.820
gluttony, wrath.

00:03:44.820 --> 00:03:48.280
Here's a company that will take two
photos of your head and use them to print

00:03:48.280 --> 00:03:51.550
a 3D action figure head of your face.

00:03:51.550 --> 00:03:54.740
The smallest size can be used on LEGO dudes.

00:03:54.740 --> 00:03:59.340
Or look, just use this backpack that
turns into a basketball

00:03:59.340 --> 00:04:02.930
hoop.
Or this goopy mud that changes color with your mood

00:04:02.930 --> 00:04:06.910
and why roll your sushi when you could
pack up this device

00:04:06.910 --> 00:04:10.740
and a have a sushi bazooka?
Here's a fun free thing.

00:04:10.740 --> 00:04:14.650
Desktop Gremlins offers easy to build
templates for fun paper

00:04:14.650 --> 00:04:17.940
creations - video game characters, books, movies.

00:04:17.940 --> 00:04:21.540
He even made a special YouTube Space Lab

00:04:21.540 --> 00:04:24.830
papercraft, because on September 13th

00:04:24.830 --> 00:04:28.540
the winning experiments will be done in outer space

00:04:28.540 --> 00:04:32.310
live, right here on YouTube.
Ok, finally,

00:04:32.310 --> 00:04:35.750
let's get beard-y.
A beard for your Apple,

00:04:35.750 --> 00:04:39.700
lavender beard conditioner, beard love buttons

00:04:39.700 --> 00:04:42.990
and last, but not least, a beer/beard

00:04:42.990 --> 00:04:47.620
cozy. Amazing, right?
Well, for more cool things you can actually own

00:04:47.620 --> 00:04:51.200
I highly suggest watching Naomi Kyle's show Cheap

00:04:51.200 --> 00:04:55.770
Cool Crazy. It's on IGN's channel START,
which is full of original programming

00:04:55.770 --> 00:04:59.030
for nerds like us.
Oh and, and,

00:04:59.030 --> 00:05:00.670
as always,

00:05:00.670 --> 00:05:02.270
thanks for watching.
