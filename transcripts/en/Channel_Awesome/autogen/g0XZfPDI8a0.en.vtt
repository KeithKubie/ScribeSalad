nature versus nurture and that was very

00:17:32.490 --> 00:17:32.500
nature versus nurture and that was very
 

00:17:32.500 --> 00:17:35.280
nature versus nurture and that was very
interesting and I really liked the best

00:17:35.280 --> 00:17:35.290
interesting and I really liked the best
 

00:17:35.290 --> 00:17:37.080
interesting and I really liked the best
of is when Picard is talking with his

00:17:37.080 --> 00:17:37.090
of is when Picard is talking with his
 

00:17:37.090 --> 00:17:38.610
of is when Picard is talking with his
younger self and they're trying to learn

00:17:38.610 --> 00:17:38.620

younger self and they're trying to learn
from each other that's great stuff and

00:17:41.100 --> 00:17:41.110
from each other that's great stuff and
 

00:17:41.110 --> 00:17:41.960
from each other that's great stuff and
that's really

00:17:41.960 --> 00:17:41.970
that's really
 

00:17:41.970 --> 00:17:45.409
that's really
complex really interesting it does get a

00:17:45.409 --> 00:17:45.419
complex really interesting it does get a
 

00:17:45.419 --> 00:17:48.830
complex really interesting it does get a
little lost in sardis overblown action

00:17:48.830 --> 00:17:48.840
little lost in sardis overblown action
 

00:17:48.840 --> 00:17:50.990
little lost in sardis overblown action
sequences and a really over-the-top even

00:17:50.990 --> 00:17:51.000
sequences and a really over-the-top even
 

00:17:51.000 --> 00:17:54.649
sequences and a really over-the-top even
by star trek standards um but at the

00:17:54.649 --> 00:17:54.659
by star trek standards um but at the
 

00:17:54.659 --> 00:17:56.330
by star trek standards um but at the
same time you just get to see some cool

00:17:56.330 --> 00:17:56.340
same time you just get to see some cool
 

00:17:56.340 --> 00:17:58.159
same time you just get to see some cool
things like I liked seeing the ships

00:17:58.159 --> 00:17:58.169
things like I liked seeing the ships
 

00:17:58.169 --> 00:18:00.950

were like the dome light slides into the

00:18:03.500 --> 00:18:03.510
were like the dome light slides into the
 

00:18:03.510 --> 00:18:06.380
were like the dome light slides into the
other ship which is fucking knots in

00:18:06.380 --> 00:18:06.390
other ship which is fucking knots in
 

00:18:06.390 --> 00:18:08.630
other ship which is fucking knots in
terms of Star Trek fucking look great I

00:18:08.630 --> 00:18:08.640
terms of Star Trek fucking look great I
 

00:18:08.640 --> 00:18:11.180
terms of Star Trek fucking look great I
thought was really cool um some things

00:18:11.180 --> 00:18:11.190

did go a little too far I think the data

00:18:13.430 --> 00:18:13.440
did go a little too far I think the data
 

00:18:13.440 --> 00:18:15.110
did go a little too far I think the data
jump from one ship to another that

00:18:15.110 --> 00:18:15.120
jump from one ship to another that
 

00:18:15.120 --> 00:18:18.380

into a space ship that was stupid so a
 

00:18:20.820 --> 00:18:23.360
into a space ship that was stupid so a
lot of the action scenes are too far and

00:18:23.360 --> 00:18:23.370
lot of the action scenes are too far and
 

00:18:23.370 --> 00:18:25.460
lot of the action scenes are too far and
over-the-top but it also gave us some

00:18:25.460 --> 00:18:25.470
over-the-top but it also gave us some
 

00:18:25.470 --> 00:18:28.490

the last film it's not a good last you
 

00:19:57.570 --> 00:19:59.089
the last film it's not a good last you
know next-generation film if that was

00:19:59.089 --> 00:19:59.099
know next-generation film if that was
 

00:19:59.099 --> 00:20:00.349
know next-generation film if that was
going to be the last one it's like come

00:20:00.349 --> 00:20:00.359
going to be the last one it's like come
 

00:20:00.359 --> 00:20:03.440
going to be the last one it's like come
on you can do better than that but it's

00:20:03.440 --> 00:20:03.450
on you can do better than that but it's
 

00:20:03.450 --> 00:20:05.749
on you can do better than that but it's
decent I'm glad I saw it had some good

00:20:05.749 --> 00:20:05.759
decent I'm glad I saw it had some good
 

00:20:05.759 --> 00:20:08.989
decent I'm glad I saw it had some good
action some good effects and not totally

00:20:08.989 --> 00:20:08.999
action some good effects and not totally
 

00:20:08.999 --> 00:20:11.599
action some good effects and not totally
devoid of character so unlike some of

00:20:11.599 --> 00:20:11.609
devoid of character so unlike some of
 

00:20:11.609 --> 00:20:13.489
devoid of character so unlike some of
your Star Trek movies which I think the

00:20:13.489 --> 00:20:13.499
your Star Trek movies which I think the
 

00:20:13.499 --> 00:20:14.839
your Star Trek movies which I think the
only the only Star Trek movie it had

00:20:14.839 --> 00:20:14.849
only the only Star Trek movie it had
 

00:20:14.849 --> 00:20:16.609
only the only Star Trek movie it had
nothing good in it like at all was

00:20:16.609 --> 00:20:16.619
nothing good in it like at all was
 

00:20:16.619 --> 00:20:18.589
nothing good in it like at all was
insurrection in my opinion now because

00:20:18.589 --> 00:20:18.599
insurrection in my opinion now because
 

00:20:18.599 --> 00:20:20.450
insurrection in my opinion now because
it's like it has the worst moment it's

00:20:20.450 --> 00:20:20.460
it's like it has the worst moment it's
 

00:20:20.460 --> 00:20:21.830
it's like it has the worst moment it's
just totally forgettable

00:20:21.830 --> 00:20:21.840
just totally forgettable
 

00:20:21.840 --> 00:20:24.680
just totally forgettable
so but every Star Trek movie has

00:20:24.680 --> 00:20:24.690
so but every Star Trek movie has
 

00:20:24.690 --> 00:20:26.570
so but every Star Trek movie has
something good as something that made

00:20:26.570 --> 00:20:26.580
something good as something that made
 

00:20:26.580 --> 00:20:29.060
something good as something that made
you glad to see it and that's pretty

00:20:29.060 --> 00:20:29.070

00:20:33.499 --> 00:20:33.509
cool so I think nemesis had there was
 

00:20:33.509 --> 00:20:34.909
cool so I think nemesis had there was
more to it than I think some people gave

00:20:34.909 --> 00:20:34.919
more to it than I think some people gave
 

00:20:34.919 --> 00:20:37.159
more to it than I think some people gave
credit for but just gets so shadowed by

00:20:37.159 --> 00:20:37.169
credit for but just gets so shadowed by
 

00:20:37.169 --> 00:20:39.019
credit for but just gets so shadowed by
those over-the-top action sequences and

00:20:39.019 --> 00:20:39.029
those over-the-top action sequences and
 

00:20:39.029 --> 00:20:41.239
those over-the-top action sequences and
some of the Dumber moments that I think

00:20:41.239 --> 00:20:41.249
some of the Dumber moments that I think
 

00:20:41.249 --> 00:20:43.310
some of the Dumber moments that I think
people just sort of forget it but I'll

00:20:43.310 --> 00:20:43.320
people just sort of forget it but I'll
 

00:20:43.320 --> 00:20:44.599
people just sort of forget it but I'll
watch it again that there's some good

00:20:44.599 --> 00:20:44.609

00:20:44.609 --> 00:20:51.739
watch it again that there's some good
