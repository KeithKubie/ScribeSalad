00:00:00.500 --> 00:00:05.009
Hey guys, I'm Nate we are back at the dome. And once again, we want to try an experiment with molten salt.

00:00:05.009 --> 00:00:09.989
We're going to try pouring it into a watermelon a cantaloupe and then just a bottle of fruit juice

00:00:17.470 --> 00:00:21.779
To be able to pour salt into our watermelon. I've got a one and a quarter inch spade bit

00:00:21.780 --> 00:00:26.759
I'm gonna drill a hole about half way in pour out the extra juice and then we should have a nice little

00:00:26.890 --> 00:00:28.890
Channel that our salt can land in

00:00:37.710 --> 00:00:41.149
To make it just a little bit easier to aim the salt right down into the hole

00:00:41.149 --> 00:00:45.439
I'm also going to use a little knife and carve a sort of funnel shape into the opening

00:00:49.960 --> 00:00:55.079
All right, that should do a pretty good job of directing our salt right down into the heart of our tiny little watermelon

00:00:55.450 --> 00:00:57.450
Now, let's try the same thing with the cantaloupe

00:01:02.809 --> 00:01:05.719
Of course a cantaloupe is a lot more hollow on the inside already

00:01:06.479 --> 00:01:10.939
Has a lot of seeds in there, but it's not solid pulp all the way through like a watermelon

00:01:20.970 --> 00:01:27.109
With our watermelon raised up right here. We should have the salt pour out nicely down into the gap

00:01:27.750 --> 00:01:33.949
Hopefully that'll really fill it up with salt and if we're lucky we'll see an exploding watermelon. The salt is nice and molten

00:01:33.950 --> 00:01:35.630
So here's the plan I will turn off the furnace

00:01:35.630 --> 00:01:40.519
I'll take the crucible out put it into the steel Cup and then I'll back away a safe distance

00:01:40.860 --> 00:01:46.220
Pull the string and hopefully all that salt will be poured right down into our watermelon. Let's give it a shot

00:01:46.890 --> 00:01:48.890
three two one

00:02:00.090 --> 00:02:02.090
Exploded immediately

00:02:02.460 --> 00:02:04.460
Immediately. Oh

00:02:04.830 --> 00:02:10.969
boy that was great, I think just the second that the salt hit the watermelon. It was already breaking open

00:02:11.490 --> 00:02:15.049
And see why it's still that hot glowing orange

00:02:16.920 --> 00:02:23.179
Some toasty salt well, there's half of our watermelon and there's the rest of our watermelon

00:02:24.540 --> 00:02:28.849
That just tore itself wide open in no time at all

00:02:29.400 --> 00:02:32.660
Turns out watermelons. Don't get along very well with molten salt. Who knew?

00:02:40.550 --> 00:02:45.730
All right, our cantaloupe is ready now we're gonna do the same thing salt will go into pouring device we'll secure it in place

00:02:45.730 --> 00:02:48.789
We'll pull the string and maybe we'll get an exploding cantaloupe

00:02:53.360 --> 00:02:55.360
123

00:02:55.360 --> 00:02:57.360
(combusting )

00:02:58.910 --> 00:03:00.910
Think it missed

00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:09.890
Not all of it

00:03:09.890 --> 00:03:15.679
But a lot of it then a cantaloupe also has a whole lot more empty space inside it then a watermelon

00:03:16.159 --> 00:03:22.369
I mean, it's steaming clearly a lot of the salt made in there see some of the salt poured off

00:03:22.370 --> 00:03:23.280
I think it actually

00:03:23.280 --> 00:03:29.599
Hit the cantaloupe and spilled off the back onto the wood here. Yep, we had some salt running down the back of the cantaloupe

00:03:30.480 --> 00:03:36.079
You definitely got salt inside it. You have to crack this thing open, see what it's doing in there

00:03:51.310 --> 00:03:56.410
It's kinda cool look at that it just filled in some the gaps that is weird

00:03:58.340 --> 00:04:00.340
salt formation

00:04:00.680 --> 00:04:02.450
It's pretty fun right there

00:04:02.450 --> 00:04:07.810
so we we did get a good amount of salt that went right into the cantaloupe just like we wanted it to

00:04:08.450 --> 00:04:13.209
We didn't explode and I think that's because the cantaloupe has a lot more of a cavity then the watermelon

00:04:13.209 --> 00:04:15.669
So when there was a little bit of pressure built up in the watermelon

00:04:15.670 --> 00:04:16.970
it had nowhere to go and

00:04:16.970 --> 00:04:23.470
So it just exploded but the cantaloupe had enough space in it that it was able to just let all of that suddenly forming steam

00:04:23.750 --> 00:04:27.940
Escape out the top. I've never smelled burning cantaloupe before

00:04:28.669 --> 00:04:35.409
Well, I've got one experiment left and it's not technically pouring salt into a fruit, but it is pouring salt into some fruit juice

00:04:35.419 --> 00:04:38.978
I'm just gonna cut the top off of this container and see if I can get molten salt to

00:04:39.199 --> 00:04:44.139
Fall down into the juice and I'm hoping for like a geyser of juice or something like that

00:05:02.650 --> 00:05:04.650
Three two one.

00:05:10.720 --> 00:05:12.720
Oh... It's pretty great

00:05:21.720 --> 00:05:23.460
Super hot crucible

00:05:23.460 --> 00:05:30.500
And there's our steel cup with some still glowing orange molten salt at the bottom of it. Alright, our juice container

00:05:31.020 --> 00:05:36.770
Largely untouched which is about what I thought mostly I was just kind of hoping for a fountain of juice to launch up

00:05:36.770 --> 00:05:40.609
But I think we got that pretty well juice or salt whichever one was launching up into the air

00:05:40.830 --> 00:05:41.870
It worked pretty well

00:05:41.870 --> 00:05:42.370
I think the watermelon definitely gave us the best results as soon as that liquid salt hit the inside of the watermelon that thing

00:05:47.340 --> 00:05:50.510
Exploded open it looked pretty great pour you into the cantaloupe

00:05:50.510 --> 00:05:54.049
We got a lot of steam out of it, but I think because there was a hollow in the center

00:05:54.050 --> 00:05:59.690
It didn't have enough pressure to really tear anything open. We got some interesting cast shapes out of our salt

00:05:59.690 --> 00:06:05.509
That's for sure and then pouring the liquid salt into the juice didn't really give us any sort of rupturing effect

00:06:05.510 --> 00:06:08.120
But we did get kind of a nice spray of salt in the air

00:06:08.120 --> 00:06:13.639
It sounded like an explosion and some of our juice definitely went flying. I think everything is covered in juice right now

00:06:13.800 --> 00:06:15.800
I'm curious if it's salty juice

00:06:19.860 --> 00:06:21.300
Yeah

00:06:21.300 --> 00:06:23.569
