ETHAN KAY: If we were to
think about the biggest

00:00:02.040 --> 00:00:05.740
problems affecting our world,
any socially conscious person

00:00:05.740 --> 00:00:10.880
would have to include poverty,
disease, and climate change.

00:00:10.880 --> 00:00:14.070
And yet, there is one
thing that causes all three

00:00:14.070 --> 00:00:16.640
of these simultaneously,
that we pay

00:00:16.640 --> 00:00:20.120
almost no attention to, even
though a very good solution

00:00:20.120 --> 00:00:21.820
exists.

00:00:21.820 --> 00:00:24.210
It's one of the most
unreported stories about life

00:00:24.210 --> 00:00:25.810
in the developing world.

00:00:25.810 --> 00:00:29.010
And I'm here to
tell you about it.

00:00:29.010 --> 00:00:32.759
In 2005, I was working with
a rural community development

00:00:32.759 --> 00:00:35.570
NGO in Osmanabad, India.

00:00:35.570 --> 00:00:39.780
As part of my work, I conducted
in-depth interviews with women

00:00:39.780 --> 00:00:41.560
in their villages.

00:00:41.560 --> 00:00:45.210
I interviewed Mina in a
village called Bamaniwadi.

00:00:45.210 --> 00:00:48.040
At the time, she was cooking
lunch for her husband

00:00:48.040 --> 00:00:50.800
and her two-year-old daughter,
who was crawling next to her

00:00:50.800 --> 00:00:52.930
as she cooked.

00:00:52.930 --> 00:00:55.080
Like most women in
the village, Mina

00:00:55.080 --> 00:00:58.070
was cooking on an
indoor open fire.

00:00:58.070 --> 00:01:02.060
Her one-room hut was
thick with smoke.

00:01:02.060 --> 00:01:04.760
By 30 minutes into the
two-hour interview,

00:01:04.760 --> 00:01:06.660
everyone's eyes were watering.

00:01:06.660 --> 00:01:08.070
We were coughing.

00:01:08.070 --> 00:01:10.500
And I could barely breathe.

00:01:10.500 --> 00:01:13.290
I was horrified when I realized
that Mina and her family

00:01:13.290 --> 00:01:16.340
have to deal with
this on a daily basis.

00:01:16.340 --> 00:01:19.500
Yet, this is how nearly
half the world lives.

00:01:19.500 --> 00:01:25.597
Three billion people cook their
meals on indoor open fires.

00:01:25.597 --> 00:01:27.930
When we think about the biggest
killers of people living

00:01:27.930 --> 00:01:29.940
in poverty in the
developing world,

00:01:29.940 --> 00:01:34.870
we think about AIDS,
tuberculosis, and malaria.

00:01:34.870 --> 00:01:37.310
We don't think
about the kitchen.

00:01:37.310 --> 00:01:40.300
Yet, every year, over
four million people

00:01:40.300 --> 00:01:43.050
die from household air
pollution from cooking

00:01:43.050 --> 00:01:46.510
on a smoky open fire.

00:01:46.510 --> 00:01:48.770
It's like wiping out
half the population

00:01:48.770 --> 00:01:52.030
of New York City every year.

00:01:52.030 --> 00:01:54.920
Household air pollution
kills more people

00:01:54.920 --> 00:01:59.324
than AIDS, tuberculosis,
and malaria combined.

00:02:01.990 --> 00:02:03.890
How does this happen?

00:02:03.890 --> 00:02:06.700
Day after day, for up
to six hours a day,

00:02:06.700 --> 00:02:10.280
women like Mina cook their
meals on an indoor open fire.

00:02:10.280 --> 00:02:13.650
And when they do, they
breathe in the toxic smoke

00:02:13.650 --> 00:02:18.650
from the flames, which leads
to fatal respiratory diseases.

00:02:18.650 --> 00:02:21.220
Half a million of these
four million deaths

00:02:21.220 --> 00:02:23.890
are children under
the age of five.

00:02:23.890 --> 00:02:25.830
The biggest killer
of young children

00:02:25.830 --> 00:02:29.570
globally is smoke
from the open fire.

00:02:29.570 --> 00:02:31.950
So there's the serious problem.

00:02:31.950 --> 00:02:33.580
And yet, we're
completely ignoring it.

00:02:36.450 --> 00:02:39.520
In addition, these open
fires have an enormous impact

00:02:39.520 --> 00:02:40.980
on our environment.

00:02:40.980 --> 00:02:42.640
The smoke from
these fires contains

00:02:42.640 --> 00:02:44.900
something called
black carbon, which

00:02:44.900 --> 00:02:48.400
is the second biggest
contributor to climate change.

00:02:48.400 --> 00:02:51.550
According to the latest
statistics on black carbon,

00:02:51.550 --> 00:02:55.900
cooking on a smoky open fire
creates more black carbon

00:02:55.900 --> 00:02:58.771
than all of the world's
cars and trucks combined.

00:03:01.360 --> 00:03:03.210
So here's the situation.

00:03:03.210 --> 00:03:05.200
We have three billion
people cooking

00:03:05.200 --> 00:03:08.780
on smoky open fires with
devastating health and climate

00:03:08.780 --> 00:03:10.530
consequences.

00:03:10.530 --> 00:03:14.030
Solving this problem would
have an enormous impact

00:03:14.030 --> 00:03:17.570
on global health
and climate change.

00:03:17.570 --> 00:03:21.520
And there is a solution, the
production and distribution

00:03:21.520 --> 00:03:23.800
of ultra-clean cook stoves.

00:03:23.800 --> 00:03:26.960
These cook stoves dramatically
reduce smoke emissions

00:03:26.960 --> 00:03:29.350
and cut fuel consumption.

00:03:29.350 --> 00:03:31.780
And I'm going to turn it
over to my colleague, Ryan,

00:03:31.780 --> 00:03:34.894
to tell you more about
how this cook stove works.

00:03:34.894 --> 00:03:36.060
RYAN GIST: Thank you, Ethan.

00:03:36.060 --> 00:03:38.520
And thanks to Google
for hosting us today.

00:03:38.520 --> 00:03:40.300
So how does this product work?

00:03:40.300 --> 00:03:41.650
We've got one here.

00:03:41.650 --> 00:03:44.060
And the process starts
with the user feeding fuel

00:03:44.060 --> 00:03:46.090
into the side of the
stove and lighting it,

00:03:46.090 --> 00:03:48.760
just the same way they would
their traditional open fire.

00:03:48.760 --> 00:03:51.930
They use the same fuels,
whether it be wood or crop

00:03:51.930 --> 00:03:54.410
residue or even animal dung.

00:03:54.410 --> 00:03:56.280
But the difference
compared to the open fire

00:03:56.280 --> 00:03:58.960
is that when they light the
fire and heat is released,

00:03:58.960 --> 00:04:01.040
a small portion of
that heat energy

00:04:01.040 --> 00:04:03.300
is converted into
electrical energy.

00:04:03.300 --> 00:04:06.490
And that electricity is
used to turn a small fan,

00:04:06.490 --> 00:04:09.200
force feeding air into
the fire, bringing oxygen,

00:04:09.200 --> 00:04:11.860
and making for very
efficient clean combustion.

00:04:11.860 --> 00:04:15.000
The smoke is almost
eliminated, over 90% reduced.

00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:17.440
And the fire burns much
more efficiently, twice

00:04:17.440 --> 00:04:18.279
as efficiently.

00:04:18.279 --> 00:04:21.160
So that for any one
given cooking task,

00:04:21.160 --> 00:04:23.950
the user only needs to
feed half as much fuel.

00:04:23.950 --> 00:04:25.830
But it gets even
better than that

00:04:25.830 --> 00:04:28.590
because as the fire builds and
more heat energy is released,

00:04:28.590 --> 00:04:30.850
more electricity is
generated, to the point

00:04:30.850 --> 00:04:34.440
where it's more electricity
than is required for the fan.

00:04:34.440 --> 00:04:36.070
And that surplus
electricity can be

00:04:36.070 --> 00:04:38.802
passed to a USB port on
the side of the stove.

00:04:38.802 --> 00:04:40.260
You can see in this
instance, we're

00:04:40.260 --> 00:04:42.115
using a small LED
light, which can

00:04:42.115 --> 00:04:43.990
be used to light the
cooking area or the home

00:04:43.990 --> 00:04:45.380
for the evening.

00:04:45.380 --> 00:04:47.900
But even more importantly, in
areas of sub-Saharan Africa

00:04:47.900 --> 00:04:50.720
and India where mobile
phone adoption has outpaced

00:04:50.720 --> 00:04:54.070
the electricity grid, it still
generates enough electricity

00:04:54.070 --> 00:04:56.320
to be able to
charge a cell phone.

00:04:56.320 --> 00:04:59.780
So it's a really dramatic change
from other ways of solving

00:04:59.780 --> 00:05:01.270
this clean cooking issue.

00:05:01.270 --> 00:05:05.160
And it provides Ethan and his
team a totally different value

00:05:05.160 --> 00:05:07.100
proposition.

00:05:07.100 --> 00:05:10.960
This technology is enabled by
an electronic device called

00:05:10.960 --> 00:05:12.804
the thermoelectric generator.

00:05:12.804 --> 00:05:14.220
And there's a lot
of ways to think

00:05:14.220 --> 00:05:15.594
about a thermoelectric
generator.

00:05:15.594 --> 00:05:18.750
But today, let's consider it
like a solar panel for heat.

00:05:18.750 --> 00:05:21.100
So rather than converting
light into electricity,

00:05:21.100 --> 00:05:23.210
we're converting heat
into electricity.

00:05:23.210 --> 00:05:26.590
And this occurs due to a pair
of metals inside the device that

00:05:26.590 --> 00:05:28.044
have a very unique property.

00:05:28.044 --> 00:05:29.960
When one of them is hot
and the other is cold,

00:05:29.960 --> 00:05:32.490
they pass electrons
to one another.

00:05:32.490 --> 00:05:36.570
So the fire provides a very
convenient source of heat.

00:05:36.570 --> 00:05:39.947
And the cooler ambient air can
be used to cool the cold side.

00:05:39.947 --> 00:05:41.780
And that's the real
elegance in this design.

00:05:41.780 --> 00:05:43.570
It's the dual use
of this fan flow.

00:05:43.570 --> 00:05:46.200
That same air that we
talked about bringing oxygen

00:05:46.200 --> 00:05:48.710
to the fire to make it burn
cleanly and efficiently

00:05:48.710 --> 00:05:51.190
is the air that's used
to cool the cold side.

00:05:51.190 --> 00:05:53.400
And it gets preheated
in this process.

00:05:53.400 --> 00:05:54.910
So the fire gets what it needs.

00:05:54.910 --> 00:05:57.960
And the user is provided
with on demand electricity.

00:05:57.960 --> 00:06:00.950
So again, this just radically
changes the value proposition

00:06:00.950 --> 00:06:03.700
that Ethan can offer
to our customers.

00:06:03.700 --> 00:06:06.480
ETHAN KAY: At a
retail price of $50,

00:06:06.480 --> 00:06:09.830
the stove pays for itself in
seven months, based on fuel

00:06:09.830 --> 00:06:11.620
and electricity savings.

00:06:11.620 --> 00:06:13.190
And it gets even better.

00:06:13.190 --> 00:06:16.050
Since the stove reduces
carbon emissions,

00:06:16.050 --> 00:06:19.150
we can take advantage of
existing carbon credit offset

00:06:19.150 --> 00:06:22.210
programs to make this stove
affordable to the poorest

00:06:22.210 --> 00:06:24.240
of the poor.

00:06:24.240 --> 00:06:26.760
You may wonder why I'm
telling you all this.

00:06:26.760 --> 00:06:28.510
I'm not an engineer.

00:06:28.510 --> 00:06:30.400
I didn't design this stove.

00:06:30.400 --> 00:06:33.310
I'm just a guy from Cleveland,
Ohio, who has trouble making

00:06:33.310 --> 00:06:35.640
a grilled cheese sandwich.

00:06:35.640 --> 00:06:37.390
But after my
experience in hundreds

00:06:37.390 --> 00:06:39.940
of smoky homes
across rural India,

00:06:39.940 --> 00:06:43.230
I set myself the goal of
trying to solve this problem.

00:06:43.230 --> 00:06:44.680
So I tried to help
the NGO that I

00:06:44.680 --> 00:06:48.030
was working with to
distribute cook stoves to Mina

00:06:48.030 --> 00:06:50.480
and her neighbors.

00:06:50.480 --> 00:06:54.000
We marketed a stove by a
large British oil company.

00:06:54.000 --> 00:06:56.010
But it had some problems.

00:06:56.010 --> 00:06:58.880
It required expensive
fuel pellets, which people

00:06:58.880 --> 00:07:00.660
didn't want to pay for.

00:07:00.660 --> 00:07:04.900
And it needed electricity,
which many villages didn't have.

00:07:04.900 --> 00:07:06.550
So it sucked.

00:07:06.550 --> 00:07:10.540
And understanding why it sucked
was my PhD thesis in Management

00:07:10.540 --> 00:07:13.160
Studies from Oxford.

00:07:13.160 --> 00:07:15.880
What this large British oil
company didn't understand

00:07:15.880 --> 00:07:17.890
was how people in
rural India interact

00:07:17.890 --> 00:07:19.860
with their cooking environment.

00:07:19.860 --> 00:07:22.480
They didn't think about the
significance of the cook stove

00:07:22.480 --> 00:07:24.272
on daily life.

00:07:24.272 --> 00:07:25.730
What I saw in the
months and months

00:07:25.730 --> 00:07:29.920
that I spent in rural India was
that for technology to work,

00:07:29.920 --> 00:07:32.770
it has to be
culturally appropriate.

00:07:32.770 --> 00:07:35.880
And it's not just this big
oil company that got it wrong.

00:07:35.880 --> 00:07:39.250
So many previous attempts at
improving the lives of people

00:07:39.250 --> 00:07:41.300
living in poverty have failed.

00:07:41.300 --> 00:07:43.430
And I came to realize that
many of those failures

00:07:43.430 --> 00:07:46.060
did not employ a
user-centered approach.

00:07:46.060 --> 00:07:49.130
They failed to take into
account how real people live,

00:07:49.130 --> 00:07:53.910
their real behaviors
and cultural practices.

00:07:53.910 --> 00:07:55.770
So how to crack the
problem of cook stoves?

00:07:58.457 --> 00:08:00.040
When I really thought
about the people

00:08:00.040 --> 00:08:02.270
that I spent time
with in rural India,

00:08:02.270 --> 00:08:05.250
I realized that the stove
was not just an appliance,

00:08:05.250 --> 00:08:08.070
but the spiritual
center of their home.

00:08:08.070 --> 00:08:10.030
They saw this fire
in their kitchen

00:08:10.030 --> 00:08:14.560
as a domestic god, a
deity, and the flame

00:08:14.560 --> 00:08:17.940
as a spiritual messenger
between them and heaven.

00:08:17.940 --> 00:08:20.400
They prayed before
the stove daily

00:08:20.400 --> 00:08:23.080
and created rangoli,
artwork they

00:08:23.080 --> 00:08:25.880
drew around the stove
with colorful chalk

00:08:25.880 --> 00:08:28.745
to consecrate it, to
make it a sacred object.

00:08:31.840 --> 00:08:34.010
In much of the developing
world, the wife

00:08:34.010 --> 00:08:36.090
is responsible for the cooking.

00:08:36.090 --> 00:08:37.960
And she and the children
disproportionately

00:08:37.960 --> 00:08:39.690
suffer the health effects.

00:08:39.690 --> 00:08:42.460
But the husband
controls the money.

00:08:42.460 --> 00:08:45.760
So how could we get both
the wife and the husband

00:08:45.760 --> 00:08:49.270
to want to purchase
a clean cook stove?

00:08:49.270 --> 00:08:52.030
Most men in rural India
have a mobile phone,

00:08:52.030 --> 00:08:56.460
which they hope will help
them improve their livelihood.

00:08:56.460 --> 00:08:58.530
But many of them can't
charge the phone at home

00:08:58.530 --> 00:09:01.040
because they don't
have electricity.

00:09:01.040 --> 00:09:03.054
Usually, there's
a commercial kiosk

00:09:03.054 --> 00:09:04.470
a few miles away
where people have

00:09:04.470 --> 00:09:06.540
to pay to charge their phone.

00:09:06.540 --> 00:09:10.750
In Kenya, people pay $3 to $4
a month to charge their phone.

00:09:10.750 --> 00:09:12.080
That's two days' salary.

00:09:12.080 --> 00:09:15.950
That 7% of their income
just to charge their phone.

00:09:15.950 --> 00:09:19.350
But since our stove generates
more than enough electricity

00:09:19.350 --> 00:09:24.310
to charge their phone, men
really like this stove.

00:09:24.310 --> 00:09:27.370
There are also some
design considerations.

00:09:27.370 --> 00:09:30.510
People in different regions
cook different dishes.

00:09:30.510 --> 00:09:33.120
In Guatemala, they
make tortillas.

00:09:33.120 --> 00:09:36.330
And so they need a really
big cooking surface.

00:09:36.330 --> 00:09:39.630
In Ghana, they stir
large pots of stew.

00:09:39.630 --> 00:09:43.270
And so they need a sturdy
stove that won't topple.

00:09:43.270 --> 00:09:46.100
In north India, they make roti.

00:09:46.100 --> 00:09:48.630
And so they need a
really hot flame.

00:09:48.630 --> 00:09:50.650
So our stove needs
to be customized

00:09:50.650 --> 00:09:54.110
to serve different cultures.

00:09:54.110 --> 00:09:56.670
So how do we get these
stoves to people?

00:09:56.670 --> 00:09:58.395
Why don't we just
get a billion dollars

00:09:58.395 --> 00:10:04.310
from Warren Buffett or Google
and throw millions of stoves

00:10:04.310 --> 00:10:06.220
at rural India?

00:10:06.220 --> 00:10:08.500
It's not a good idea.

00:10:08.500 --> 00:10:10.130
People don't want charity.

00:10:10.130 --> 00:10:13.040
The people in rural India,
just like you and me,

00:10:13.040 --> 00:10:14.630
want their cherished
objects to be

00:10:14.630 --> 00:10:18.430
the result of their effort and
their economic achievement.

00:10:18.430 --> 00:10:22.290
Also, if they got the stoves
for free and they broke down

00:10:22.290 --> 00:10:23.770
and they couldn't
fix them, they'd

00:10:23.770 --> 00:10:27.960
go right back to cooking
on their open fire.

00:10:27.960 --> 00:10:31.100
We started designing
our business in 2010

00:10:31.100 --> 00:10:35.260
and thought that surely by now
we'd have a scaled up business.

00:10:35.260 --> 00:10:37.600
But we didn't anticipate
all of the hurdles that

00:10:37.600 --> 00:10:42.270
come with operating in rural
India and sub-Saharan Africa.

00:10:42.270 --> 00:10:47.620
For instance, in Uganda, the
tax rate on imported cook stoves

00:10:47.620 --> 00:10:50.150
is 60%.

00:10:50.150 --> 00:10:55.690
That means a $30 cook stove
costs the end customer $48.

00:10:55.690 --> 00:11:01.530
So we've had to get creative
and scrappy and lucky.

00:11:01.530 --> 00:11:05.070
Last January, the
vice-president of Uganda

00:11:05.070 --> 00:11:07.780
unexpectedly visited one
of our stove demonstrations

00:11:07.780 --> 00:11:09.600
in Kampala.

00:11:09.600 --> 00:11:12.860
He wanted to buy a stove,
but wanted to bargain down

00:11:12.860 --> 00:11:15.070
the retail price.

00:11:15.070 --> 00:11:16.960
We bargained back.

00:11:16.960 --> 00:11:19.820
We told him if his
government reduces

00:11:19.820 --> 00:11:22.490
taxes on this
life-enhancing product,

00:11:22.490 --> 00:11:24.560
we can reduce the cost
of the stove for him

00:11:24.560 --> 00:11:27.420
as well as the rest
of the country.

00:11:27.420 --> 00:11:29.420
After a year of
negotiations, we've

00:11:29.420 --> 00:11:33.790
managed to cut our tax rate
in Uganda by nearly half.

00:11:33.790 --> 00:11:37.220
We've also had some
unexpected setbacks.

00:11:37.220 --> 00:11:40.820
Our Ghana manager tried to
be culturally appropriate

00:11:40.820 --> 00:11:46.840
and ate a bush cat grilled
in his honor on the stove.

00:11:46.840 --> 00:11:50.870
Jan spent the next
month in the hospital.

00:11:50.870 --> 00:11:54.660
We've also had some
unexpected surprises.

00:11:54.660 --> 00:12:01.570
Our most successful sales agent
in India is also a magician.

00:12:01.570 --> 00:12:06.110
When demonstrating the stove,
Himanshu flicks a lit match

00:12:06.110 --> 00:12:08.580
from five feet away into
the mouth of the stove.

00:12:08.580 --> 00:12:11.620
And it immediately
lights the flame.

00:12:11.620 --> 00:12:13.630
Ryan and his engineering
team have also

00:12:13.630 --> 00:12:16.029
had to get creative and scrappy.

00:12:16.029 --> 00:12:17.070
RYAN GIST: Yeah, we have.

00:12:17.070 --> 00:12:18.674
And creative design
is one thing.

00:12:18.674 --> 00:12:21.090
But we've had to get creative
with the whole supply chain,

00:12:21.090 --> 00:12:22.770
as well.

00:12:22.770 --> 00:12:26.070
When your customers are very low
income and tightly constrained

00:12:26.070 --> 00:12:30.260
by their purchasing power,
pricing is critical.

00:12:30.260 --> 00:12:32.680
And as Ethan described, with
some of the taxes and tariffs

00:12:32.680 --> 00:12:35.910
that are imposed on us in
the markets we operate,

00:12:35.910 --> 00:12:38.200
there's a really powerful
compounding effect

00:12:38.200 --> 00:12:41.112
on the initial cost of goods.

00:12:41.112 --> 00:12:42.820
When we first got
started in all of this,

00:12:42.820 --> 00:12:45.530
we took a very standard
approach to component sourcing

00:12:45.530 --> 00:12:47.009
for the stove.

00:12:47.009 --> 00:12:48.050
We understood our system.

00:12:48.050 --> 00:12:49.690
We knew what each
piece needed to do.

00:12:49.690 --> 00:12:51.810
And we worked with
vendors to find

00:12:51.810 --> 00:12:53.980
catalog parts that
could get each one

00:12:53.980 --> 00:12:56.220
of those individual jobs done.

00:12:56.220 --> 00:12:58.680
We weren't experts in
thermoelectric generators.

00:12:58.680 --> 00:13:01.780
We weren't fan
designers or experts

00:13:01.780 --> 00:13:06.080
in power electronics
or metallurgists.

00:13:06.080 --> 00:13:09.330
We took their word
for it, really.

00:13:09.330 --> 00:13:11.260
But over the course
of the project

00:13:11.260 --> 00:13:13.810
and learning more
about the task at hand,

00:13:13.810 --> 00:13:15.820
we realized to really
delight our customer

00:13:15.820 --> 00:13:18.330
and to provide the product at
a price that they can afford,

00:13:18.330 --> 00:13:20.052
we had to do all those things.

00:13:20.052 --> 00:13:22.260
And so we've asked all the
members of the engineering

00:13:22.260 --> 00:13:24.670
team and the development
team to build expertise

00:13:24.670 --> 00:13:27.840
in totally new areas for them.

00:13:27.840 --> 00:13:30.630
I can walk you
through one example.

00:13:30.630 --> 00:13:33.095
At the core of the
system is the fan.

00:13:33.095 --> 00:13:35.560
And in the first
generation of the stove,

00:13:35.560 --> 00:13:39.110
we talked to every fan
manufacturer we could.

00:13:39.110 --> 00:13:42.230
And we identified a fan
that was a computer cooling

00:13:42.230 --> 00:13:45.230
fan, that was about right
for our application.

00:13:45.230 --> 00:13:48.160
These fans are mass produced
with all the benefits

00:13:48.160 --> 00:13:49.990
of economy of scale baked in.

00:13:49.990 --> 00:13:53.190
They appear in computers by
the millions the world over.

00:13:53.190 --> 00:13:54.940
So at about $3 a pop,
we thought we were

00:13:54.940 --> 00:13:56.920
getting a pretty good deal.

00:13:56.920 --> 00:14:00.270
The problem is that even $3
is a really significant chunk

00:14:00.270 --> 00:14:01.880
of our overall
cost of production

00:14:01.880 --> 00:14:04.340
for this affordable stove.

00:14:04.340 --> 00:14:06.300
And on top of that,
the fan was never

00:14:06.300 --> 00:14:07.865
designed for our application.

00:14:07.865 --> 00:14:10.240
So we had to actually purchase
a slightly larger version,

00:14:10.240 --> 00:14:13.670
knowing that it would run
not at peak efficiency.

00:14:13.670 --> 00:14:15.410
That simply wasn't
going to work.

00:14:15.410 --> 00:14:17.450
So we dug in, and like
I said, became experts.

00:14:17.450 --> 00:14:20.200
We studied compact fan design.

00:14:20.200 --> 00:14:23.530
We brought in tools to
do aerodynamic analysis

00:14:23.530 --> 00:14:26.390
on the duct work
inside of our product.

00:14:26.390 --> 00:14:28.140
We learned how to
control the fans.

00:14:28.140 --> 00:14:30.940
We even learned how to
design the electric motors

00:14:30.940 --> 00:14:32.439
that power of these fans.

00:14:32.439 --> 00:14:34.980
And the end result was that we
were able to short cut the fan

00:14:34.980 --> 00:14:38.530
manufacture entirely, source
a motor that could do the job

00:14:38.530 --> 00:14:42.670
for about $0.50, custom design
our own fan blades that could

00:14:42.670 --> 00:14:45.410
be injection molded
for about $0.10,

00:14:45.410 --> 00:14:47.850
run the fan from our
own power electronics,

00:14:47.850 --> 00:14:51.150
and incorporate the rest of
the housing into the plastic

00:14:51.150 --> 00:14:53.380
enclosure already
part of the product.

00:14:53.380 --> 00:14:56.250
And so in the end, a
component that cost $3 we now

00:14:56.250 --> 00:14:59.880
can make for under $1, saving
over 70% on that component

00:14:59.880 --> 00:15:00.630
alone.

00:15:00.630 --> 00:15:03.230
And we fought similar sourcing
battles across the product

00:15:03.230 --> 00:15:06.280
all over, in the metals in
the stove, the electronics,

00:15:06.280 --> 00:15:09.030
the thermoelectric.

00:15:09.030 --> 00:15:12.640
But the point is that we really
had to dive and become experts.

00:15:12.640 --> 00:15:13.887
And pricing is one half.

00:15:13.887 --> 00:15:15.720
But we also need to
understand the customer.

00:15:15.720 --> 00:15:17.407
And we pushed
really hard to have

00:15:17.407 --> 00:15:18.990
every engineer on
the development team

00:15:18.990 --> 00:15:22.790
pay equal attention to our
users and the user needs.

00:15:22.790 --> 00:15:26.830
We spent weeks and months in
the field with Ethan's team,

00:15:26.830 --> 00:15:30.282
observing cooking, watching
household energy management,

00:15:30.282 --> 00:15:32.240
and sitting down with
the cooks to really learn

00:15:32.240 --> 00:15:34.190
how they interact
with the stove, what

00:15:34.190 --> 00:15:37.406
the potential pitfalls
and pain points might be.

00:15:37.406 --> 00:15:38.780
We learned a lot
in this process.

00:15:38.780 --> 00:15:40.830
I always say a week
in the field can

00:15:40.830 --> 00:15:43.860
be more informative
than a month in the lab.

00:15:43.860 --> 00:15:46.430
And even as recently
as late last year,

00:15:46.430 --> 00:15:49.810
we've made some pretty
key understandings

00:15:49.810 --> 00:15:51.670
during this process.

00:15:51.670 --> 00:15:54.760
One specific incident
late last year,

00:15:54.760 --> 00:15:56.080
we were watching people cook.

00:15:56.080 --> 00:15:58.170
And in some regions,
for certain dishes,

00:15:58.170 --> 00:16:00.750
rather than just an hour or
two hours worth of cooking,

00:16:00.750 --> 00:16:02.950
they cook nearly all day,
for three, four, five

00:16:02.950 --> 00:16:04.237
hours at a time.

00:16:04.237 --> 00:16:06.070
And during these really
long duration burns,

00:16:06.070 --> 00:16:08.750
some of the fuel doesn't
quite fully combust.

00:16:08.750 --> 00:16:10.650
And you build
charcoal in the stove.

00:16:10.650 --> 00:16:12.460
This charcoal builds
up and eventually,

00:16:12.460 --> 00:16:13.990
over the course of
four hours or so,

00:16:13.990 --> 00:16:15.350
can fill up the whole chamber.

00:16:15.350 --> 00:16:17.350
And so you need to remove
that charcoal in order

00:16:17.350 --> 00:16:20.064
to keep cooking,
to feed fresh fuel.

00:16:20.064 --> 00:16:21.480
Well, the problem
is we've now got

00:16:21.480 --> 00:16:23.970
a cook who's pulling out
a large burning stick

00:16:23.970 --> 00:16:26.510
and essentially holding an
open fire now in their hand,

00:16:26.510 --> 00:16:28.450
emitting all the smoke
that an open fire does.

00:16:28.450 --> 00:16:31.980
And what we saw was that during
this process of pulling out

00:16:31.980 --> 00:16:33.770
the burning fuel,
clearing the charcoal,

00:16:33.770 --> 00:16:35.699
and putting it back
in, all that smoke

00:16:35.699 --> 00:16:37.490
we had just saved over
the last three hours

00:16:37.490 --> 00:16:39.480
was now emitted into the home.

00:16:39.480 --> 00:16:41.820
So we knew it was an issue
that had to be solved.

00:16:41.820 --> 00:16:43.060
We came back into the lab.

00:16:43.060 --> 00:16:46.340
We built out capability to
do long duration burns here

00:16:46.340 --> 00:16:47.820
in our labs for hours on end.

00:16:47.820 --> 00:16:50.170
We sourced the
appropriate fuel to be

00:16:50.170 --> 00:16:51.940
able to simulate conditions.

00:16:51.940 --> 00:16:54.150
And we re-tuned the
entire injection scheme

00:16:54.150 --> 00:16:56.240
to make sure that not
only the flame was burning

00:16:56.240 --> 00:16:58.650
clean and efficiently, but
this charcoal was fully

00:16:58.650 --> 00:16:59.850
combusted and used.

00:16:59.850 --> 00:17:03.616
We eliminated the need for this
charcoal clearing exercise.

00:17:03.616 --> 00:17:04.740
And so I think we're close.

00:17:04.740 --> 00:17:06.280
We've got the right product.

00:17:06.280 --> 00:17:08.474
We're zeroing in
on the cost target.

00:17:08.474 --> 00:17:10.140
And it's really up
to Ethan and his team

00:17:10.140 --> 00:17:14.232
to go get these stoves into all
the households that need them.

00:17:14.232 --> 00:17:15.690
ETHAN KAY: Our
business is on track

00:17:15.690 --> 00:17:17.920
to be self-sustaining
and profitable.

00:17:17.920 --> 00:17:20.329
But it's going to take a
lot of patience and capital

00:17:20.329 --> 00:17:21.680
to get there.

00:17:21.680 --> 00:17:23.680
Fortunately, we've
built this patience

00:17:23.680 --> 00:17:25.560
into our business model.

00:17:25.560 --> 00:17:29.460
In addition to selling cook
stoves in the developing world,

00:17:29.460 --> 00:17:32.210
we also commercialized a line
of camping products, which

00:17:32.210 --> 00:17:35.860
we sell to outdoor recreation
customers in the US

00:17:35.860 --> 00:17:38.210
and over 70 other countries.

00:17:38.210 --> 00:17:42.300
We call this business
model parallel innovation.

00:17:42.300 --> 00:17:45.810
This is not a TOMS shoes,
one-for-one handout model.

00:17:45.810 --> 00:17:48.950
This is about reinvesting
near-term revenue

00:17:48.950 --> 00:17:51.100
from the sale of
our camping products

00:17:51.100 --> 00:17:53.620
to incubate the emerging
markets business until it's

00:17:53.620 --> 00:17:55.640
commercially self-sufficient.

00:17:55.640 --> 00:17:57.530
I'd love to talk to
any of you afterward

00:17:57.530 --> 00:17:59.661
about how we can make this
business model even more

00:17:59.661 --> 00:18:00.160
sustainable.

00:18:03.270 --> 00:18:09.030
Around 1440, Johannes
Gutenberg, an entrepreneur

00:18:09.030 --> 00:18:14.100
with a great beard, set out
to develop the printing press.

00:18:14.100 --> 00:18:17.710
At the time, scribes
wrote books by hand.

00:18:17.710 --> 00:18:21.240
Yet, the challenge of inventing
a printing press were daunting.

00:18:21.240 --> 00:18:24.440
Civilizations had been
trying for thousands of years

00:18:24.440 --> 00:18:27.000
to mechanically
reproduce texts--

00:18:27.000 --> 00:18:31.320
the Minoans, the
Greeks, the Chinese.

00:18:31.320 --> 00:18:33.150
Yet, it never took off.

00:18:33.150 --> 00:18:35.440
In each case, there
was something missing

00:18:35.440 --> 00:18:38.290
that was crucial to
mass uptake, whether it

00:18:38.290 --> 00:18:42.020
was the invention of
paper or the alphabet

00:18:42.020 --> 00:18:47.030
or expanded literacy or
buy-in from religious elites.

00:18:47.030 --> 00:18:49.470
It wasn't just a
technology problem.

00:18:49.470 --> 00:18:51.650
For printing to catch
on, all of these

00:18:51.650 --> 00:18:54.520
technical and cultural
and social elements

00:18:54.520 --> 00:18:56.870
needed to align.

00:18:56.870 --> 00:18:59.480
Gutenberg understood the need
to develop a contextually

00:18:59.480 --> 00:19:01.280
appropriate solution.

00:19:01.280 --> 00:19:04.880
For instance, he
designed his typeface

00:19:04.880 --> 00:19:07.280
to look like
scribal handwriting,

00:19:07.280 --> 00:19:09.330
so that it was
consistent with the look

00:19:09.330 --> 00:19:12.880
of valuable illuminated
manuscripts.

00:19:12.880 --> 00:19:15.470
He didn't want to break
with existing culture,

00:19:15.470 --> 00:19:19.280
or else he'd alienate
prospective buyers.

00:19:19.280 --> 00:19:22.780
Also, since the church
controlled the book industry,

00:19:22.780 --> 00:19:25.710
he, just like us
with cook stoves,

00:19:25.710 --> 00:19:28.640
needed to get religious
leaders on board.

00:19:28.640 --> 00:19:32.430
He made his first product
the Bible, which as we know,

00:19:32.430 --> 00:19:34.890
went viral.

00:19:34.890 --> 00:19:37.110
This was one of the most
important inventions

00:19:37.110 --> 00:19:40.950
in world history because it led
to the explosion of knowledge.

00:19:40.950 --> 00:19:44.290
But it only took off because it
was consistent with the social,

00:19:44.290 --> 00:19:48.060
cultural, and religious context.

00:19:48.060 --> 00:19:51.410
Today, as in Gutenberg's
time, in order

00:19:51.410 --> 00:19:54.290
to design solutions
for any community,

00:19:54.290 --> 00:19:56.460
particularly in the
developing world,

00:19:56.460 --> 00:19:58.790
it's important to acquire
an in-depth understanding

00:19:58.790 --> 00:20:01.510
of local users and
their motivations.

00:20:01.510 --> 00:20:04.400
It's important to understand
how real people live,

00:20:04.400 --> 00:20:07.280
their culture,
and their beliefs.

00:20:07.280 --> 00:20:09.990
If we do this
intelligently, we can

00:20:09.990 --> 00:20:13.470
solve some of the world's
most serious problems.

00:20:13.470 --> 00:20:17.290
This is the BioLite home stove.

00:20:17.290 --> 00:20:20.130
Ryan and I are 34.

00:20:20.130 --> 00:20:22.700
By the time we're 40,
let's make sure there

00:20:22.700 --> 00:20:25.290
are millions and millions
of these stoves saving lives

00:20:25.290 --> 00:20:27.630
across India and Africa.

00:20:27.630 --> 00:20:28.520
Thank you.

00:20:28.520 --> 00:20:31.070
[APPLAUSE]

00:20:39.420 --> 00:20:42.440
AUDIENCE: Hi, my name is Chris.

00:20:42.440 --> 00:20:46.670
Health data is notoriously
difficult to gather.

00:20:46.670 --> 00:20:49.450
So could you talk a little bit
about the methodology for how

00:20:49.450 --> 00:20:51.390
you quantified this
problem, like how

00:20:51.390 --> 00:20:54.840
you're attributing these
premature deaths to the smoke?

00:20:54.840 --> 00:20:56.410
Is it condition-based?

00:20:56.410 --> 00:20:59.386
I would love to hear
more about that.

00:20:59.386 --> 00:21:00.510
ETHAN KAY: Do you want me--

00:21:00.510 --> 00:21:01.260
RYAN GIST: Yeah, you
should take that.

00:21:01.260 --> 00:21:03.347
I mean, we don't develop
that data ourselves.

00:21:03.347 --> 00:21:04.430
But you could speak to it.

00:21:04.430 --> 00:21:07.520
ETHAN KAY: So the data on the
magnitude of deaths attributed

00:21:07.520 --> 00:21:10.130
to household air pollution are
provided by the World Health

00:21:10.130 --> 00:21:12.600
Organization.

00:21:12.600 --> 00:21:16.810
And the primary deaths are
both respiratory disease

00:21:16.810 --> 00:21:22.410
and cardiovascular disease
and cardiopulmonary disease.

00:21:22.410 --> 00:21:27.980
There's been a big challenge
in the global public health

00:21:27.980 --> 00:21:32.280
community, not around
attributing deaths

00:21:32.280 --> 00:21:36.260
from these diseases, but
rather in quantifying

00:21:36.260 --> 00:21:41.240
the health impact of stoves like
these to address those deaths.

00:21:41.240 --> 00:21:45.530
So the public health
community argues

00:21:45.530 --> 00:21:50.590
that you need a 90% reduction
in particulate matter

00:21:50.590 --> 00:21:54.520
in order to mitigate the
risk of respiratory disease.

00:21:54.520 --> 00:21:57.860
And if we can nerd
it out for a second,

00:21:57.860 --> 00:22:03.320
the relationship between
respiratory disease and air

00:22:03.320 --> 00:22:05.470
pollution is not linear.

00:22:05.470 --> 00:22:06.860
It's logarithmic.

00:22:06.860 --> 00:22:12.540
So you need literally a 10x
reduction from an open fire

00:22:12.540 --> 00:22:15.410
in order to have a 50%
reduction in the risk

00:22:15.410 --> 00:22:17.340
factor for respiratory disease.

00:22:17.340 --> 00:22:20.550
And so the first thing that
we as an organization did

00:22:20.550 --> 00:22:24.470
was, have had to validate
in our own lab, which

00:22:24.470 --> 00:22:27.490
is built to the same standards,
and Ryan can elaborate on this,

00:22:27.490 --> 00:22:32.200
as the US EPA that our stove
produces smoke in laboratory

00:22:32.200 --> 00:22:35.850
conditions by at least
90%, which we've done so,

00:22:35.850 --> 00:22:40.140
and have also had the EPA
and the government of India

00:22:40.140 --> 00:22:43.120
and other independent bodies
independently verify that.

00:22:43.120 --> 00:22:48.960
We then took stoves to the
field and have done studies

00:22:48.960 --> 00:22:52.790
with independent testing groups
like Berkeley Air Monitoring,

00:22:52.790 --> 00:22:54.850
which is a group
out of California,

00:22:54.850 --> 00:22:58.376
to validate that with the types
of fuels that people are using

00:22:58.376 --> 00:23:01.000
and the way that they're used to
feeding the fuels that it also

00:23:01.000 --> 00:23:05.400
achieves a 90% reduction
in respiratory disease.

00:23:05.400 --> 00:23:07.420
And we've done that, as well.

00:23:07.420 --> 00:23:15.340
And then the final step
is the gold standard

00:23:15.340 --> 00:23:18.650
in research methods, which is
a randomized control trial.

00:23:18.650 --> 00:23:20.950
And so for the last
2 and 1/2 years,

00:23:20.950 --> 00:23:24.250
BioLite has been participating
in the world's largest

00:23:24.250 --> 00:23:28.370
randomized controlled trial of
the health impact of this cook

00:23:28.370 --> 00:23:31.550
stove on young children.

00:23:31.550 --> 00:23:34.560
And it's a National
Institute of Health funded

00:23:34.560 --> 00:23:38.630
study, administered by Columbia
University's School of Public

00:23:38.630 --> 00:23:40.870
Health and the Ghanaian
Ministry of Health.

00:23:40.870 --> 00:23:45.340
And the results aren't out yet,
but that's the third piece,

00:23:45.340 --> 00:23:49.687
validating that these stoves
have impact on villagers.

00:23:49.687 --> 00:23:50.437
RYAN GIST: Thanks.

00:23:53.156 --> 00:23:54.530
AUDIENCE: Hey,
how does the stove

00:23:54.530 --> 00:23:56.750
compare with the typical
rocket stove design?

00:23:56.750 --> 00:23:59.862
Is it basically the same thing
or a completely different idea?

00:23:59.862 --> 00:24:01.820
RYAN GIST: Well, totally
different in that it's

00:24:01.820 --> 00:24:03.360
a forced draft stove.

00:24:03.360 --> 00:24:05.457
So it does have a rocket
stove architecture.

00:24:05.457 --> 00:24:07.040
And for everybody
else out here that's

00:24:07.040 --> 00:24:08.860
not familiar with
the rocket stove,

00:24:08.860 --> 00:24:11.772
it's a basic stove
architecture that's essentially

00:24:11.772 --> 00:24:12.980
like a chimney in your house.

00:24:12.980 --> 00:24:15.190
You've got this L
shape that's properly

00:24:15.190 --> 00:24:17.950
sized in terms of
the inlet and also

00:24:17.950 --> 00:24:19.990
the outlet of the
top of the stove.

00:24:19.990 --> 00:24:22.910
And so as the fire
releases heat,

00:24:22.910 --> 00:24:25.650
it induces this natural
draft, pulls air

00:24:25.650 --> 00:24:27.885
in from the ambient
through the fire,

00:24:27.885 --> 00:24:29.010
and then comes out the top.

00:24:29.010 --> 00:24:31.343
And the other thing that's
important in the rocket stove

00:24:31.343 --> 00:24:33.040
architecture is
all the insulation

00:24:33.040 --> 00:24:34.400
that's built around that.

00:24:34.400 --> 00:24:36.510
And so there's a
bunch of insulation

00:24:36.510 --> 00:24:40.540
between this outer wall and
the hot wall inside the chamber

00:24:40.540 --> 00:24:42.770
so that all the heat really
gets directed directly

00:24:42.770 --> 00:24:47.250
to the cooking surface rather
than lost out to the ambient.

00:24:47.250 --> 00:24:50.110
So a rocket stove can
improve the fuel efficiency.

00:24:50.110 --> 00:24:52.569
But the problem is, for each
gram of fuel that you burn,

00:24:52.569 --> 00:24:54.110
you're still emitting
all this smoke.

00:24:54.110 --> 00:24:56.300
You're not really getting
complete combustion.

00:24:56.300 --> 00:24:58.730
You're not getting intimate
mixing between the oxygen

00:24:58.730 --> 00:24:59.970
and the fuel molecules.

00:24:59.970 --> 00:25:01.770
And the fan, with
our injection array,

00:25:01.770 --> 00:25:04.660
getting turbulent mixing
at each jet location really

00:25:04.660 --> 00:25:06.330
is what changes that.

00:25:06.330 --> 00:25:08.660
So we've used the
rocket architecture

00:25:08.660 --> 00:25:10.300
to improve the fuel economy.

00:25:10.300 --> 00:25:12.300
And then we've used our
air injection technology

00:25:12.300 --> 00:25:15.310
to make sure each
gram of fuel released

00:25:15.310 --> 00:25:18.174
is 90% less particulate matter.

00:25:18.174 --> 00:25:20.340
AUDIENCE: And did you
consider any exhaust solutions

00:25:20.340 --> 00:25:24.920
because burning the fuel
more cleanly is one good way.

00:25:24.920 --> 00:25:27.390
But another obvious thing
that pops into my mind

00:25:27.390 --> 00:25:29.340
is, if the smoke gets
exhausted outside

00:25:29.340 --> 00:25:31.840
rather than just being released
in the air inside the house.

00:25:31.840 --> 00:25:32.120
RYAN GIST: Sure.

00:25:32.120 --> 00:25:34.450
AUDIENCE: Would there be a
plug-in or some kind of a way?

00:25:34.450 --> 00:25:35.850
Or is that just not
practical with the way

00:25:35.850 --> 00:25:37.090
that these stoves
are typically used?

00:25:37.090 --> 00:25:39.173
RYAN GIST: It can be
practical in certain markets.

00:25:39.173 --> 00:25:41.270
Ethan showed you
the cooking style

00:25:41.270 --> 00:25:43.900
in Latin America, which is
on a wide plancha stove.

00:25:43.900 --> 00:25:47.082
And those are usually inbuilt
stoves that are fixed in place.

00:25:47.082 --> 00:25:48.790
And adding a chimney
to a stove like that

00:25:48.790 --> 00:25:51.507
can really dramatically
improve indoor air pollution.

00:25:51.507 --> 00:25:53.090
There are a couple
problems with that.

00:25:53.090 --> 00:25:54.506
I mean, for one,
you're not really

00:25:54.506 --> 00:25:56.360
addressing the
environmental impacts

00:25:56.360 --> 00:25:57.830
of all that black carbon.

00:25:57.830 --> 00:26:00.300
The black carbon is
a huge forcing factor

00:26:00.300 --> 00:26:01.580
on global warming potential.

00:26:01.580 --> 00:26:03.540
So we'd rather burn
it to completion

00:26:03.540 --> 00:26:05.340
than just dump it outside.

00:26:05.340 --> 00:26:08.890
But also, there are cultural
contexts in daily use modes

00:26:08.890 --> 00:26:11.130
where the stove really
needs to be flexible.

00:26:11.130 --> 00:26:13.550
And people need to be able
to put different cooking

00:26:13.550 --> 00:26:14.620
implements on top of it.

00:26:14.620 --> 00:26:18.580
So a compact, portable stove
like this is much more useful.

00:26:18.580 --> 00:26:20.547
It requires a lot
less behavior change

00:26:20.547 --> 00:26:22.380
than something that's
inbuilt with a chimney

00:26:22.380 --> 00:26:24.764
that pipes the flow
outside of the home.

00:26:24.764 --> 00:26:27.295
AUDIENCE: Thanks.

00:26:27.295 --> 00:26:29.295
AUDIENCE: Do you do all
your manufacturing here?

00:26:29.295 --> 00:26:32.000
Or do you try to have a local
supply chain in the countries

00:26:32.000 --> 00:26:33.444
where you're selling the stoves?

00:26:36.206 --> 00:26:38.080
RYAN GIST: We can tag
team this one, I guess.

00:26:38.080 --> 00:26:40.880
I mean, currently the stoves
are produced in China.

00:26:40.880 --> 00:26:44.320
That's the cheapest way we
can generate them and have

00:26:44.320 --> 00:26:47.720
the quality control that we need
for the electronics components.

00:26:47.720 --> 00:26:51.370
We're working in both
India and East Africa

00:26:51.370 --> 00:26:53.780
to find options
for local assembly

00:26:53.780 --> 00:26:57.659
and some local production of
the metallic parts of the stove.

00:26:57.659 --> 00:26:59.950
You can imagine that the cast
iron pieces and the metal

00:26:59.950 --> 00:27:01.229
pieces are heavy.

00:27:01.229 --> 00:27:03.020
They're expensive to
ship around the world.

00:27:03.020 --> 00:27:07.250
So bringing those pieces of
the production in-country

00:27:07.250 --> 00:27:09.070
can reduce our tariff rates.

00:27:09.070 --> 00:27:12.680
It can invigorate local
businesses in those countries

00:27:12.680 --> 00:27:15.217
and also reduce the
shipping costs for us.

00:27:15.217 --> 00:27:16.800
But in order to keep
the quality where

00:27:16.800 --> 00:27:18.300
it needs to be on
our electronics

00:27:18.300 --> 00:27:21.180
components and the fan and
some of the internal geometry,

00:27:21.180 --> 00:27:23.479
we'll probably keep most
of that in southern China

00:27:23.479 --> 00:27:24.270
for the time being.

00:27:26.895 --> 00:27:27.770
AUDIENCE: Hey, there.

00:27:27.770 --> 00:27:30.020
Thanks for coming.

00:27:30.020 --> 00:27:31.610
I'm curious about
a couple of things.

00:27:31.610 --> 00:27:33.310
One is around your supply chain.

00:27:33.310 --> 00:27:35.690
I'd like to hear some of
the challenges of getting

00:27:35.690 --> 00:27:38.710
this product to the
people that need it.

00:27:38.710 --> 00:27:40.740
And things break.

00:27:40.740 --> 00:27:43.360
Once they break, what kind
of challenges and what kind

00:27:43.360 --> 00:27:46.330
of solutions have you come up
with for helping the people

00:27:46.330 --> 00:27:49.270
there repair their own devices?

00:27:49.270 --> 00:27:50.760
ETHAN KAY: Sure.

00:27:50.760 --> 00:27:54.820
So the first time that
we shipped as pilot units

00:27:54.820 --> 00:28:01.890
to India, I think
40% of them ended up

00:28:01.890 --> 00:28:04.650
smashed by the time they
reached the end user.

00:28:04.650 --> 00:28:08.310
And it turned out that
they were being thrown off

00:28:08.310 --> 00:28:12.920
the top of trains and buses.

00:28:12.920 --> 00:28:18.025
And so we had to augment our
packaging to address that.

00:28:20.720 --> 00:28:23.280
One of the biggest challenges
in the business model

00:28:23.280 --> 00:28:26.130
is what we call last
mile distribution, which

00:28:26.130 --> 00:28:30.190
is, once you've
left a city and have

00:28:30.190 --> 00:28:33.270
to get the product
to a villager's home,

00:28:33.270 --> 00:28:39.540
the roads, if there are roads at
all, they're very poor quality.

00:28:39.540 --> 00:28:46.160
And so we've designed these--

00:28:46.160 --> 00:28:49.630
I don't know if any
of you have seen

00:28:49.630 --> 00:28:52.850
on the back of motorcycles,
there are these pizza boxes

00:28:52.850 --> 00:28:54.870
sometimes in the
developing world.

00:28:54.870 --> 00:28:58.640
Domino's delivers their
pizzas with these, like,

00:28:58.640 --> 00:29:00.680
boxes on the back of motorbikes.

00:29:00.680 --> 00:29:03.090
And so we've designed
a similar box

00:29:03.090 --> 00:29:09.580
for transporting our stoves on
motorbikes because our village

00:29:09.580 --> 00:29:11.410
distribution agents
ride motorbikes

00:29:11.410 --> 00:29:13.780
to get stoves to end user.

00:29:13.780 --> 00:29:15.700
And we've even
designed an apparatus

00:29:15.700 --> 00:29:17.820
that can allow you to
carry six of these stoves

00:29:17.820 --> 00:29:22.410
on the back of the bike
in a pretty safe way.

00:29:22.410 --> 00:29:28.920
Beyond that, we really think
that customer engagement

00:29:28.920 --> 00:29:31.220
starts at the point of sale.

00:29:31.220 --> 00:29:32.810
It doesn't stop then.

00:29:32.810 --> 00:29:37.620
And so we've invested really
heavily in after sale service.

00:29:37.620 --> 00:29:41.590
And so, I'll just share
a couple aspects of it.

00:29:41.590 --> 00:29:44.110
The first is that we've set
up a call center in each

00:29:44.110 --> 00:29:47.590
of our markets that follows up
with every one of our customers

00:29:47.590 --> 00:29:51.330
who's purchased the stove,
first a couple weeks

00:29:51.330 --> 00:29:53.830
after the point of sale to make
sure that they were properly

00:29:53.830 --> 00:29:55.970
trained when they
were sold the product

00:29:55.970 --> 00:29:59.300
and to make sure they don't
have immediate user issues, then

00:29:59.300 --> 00:30:03.390
at six months and a year
after to find out, do they

00:30:03.390 --> 00:30:06.060
like the stove, is it delivering
on its feature set, would they

00:30:06.060 --> 00:30:09.230
recommend it to
others, et cetera.

00:30:09.230 --> 00:30:13.010
And then in addition to
that, Ryan and his team

00:30:13.010 --> 00:30:18.190
have designed the stove to
be very, very easy to repair.

00:30:18.190 --> 00:30:19.690
And maybe you can
elaborate on that.

00:30:19.690 --> 00:30:21.689
RYAN GIST: Yeah, no, I'm
glad you brought it up.

00:30:21.689 --> 00:30:23.350
I was going to add
to that at the end.

00:30:23.350 --> 00:30:26.300
But essentially, there's two
main halves of the stove.

00:30:26.300 --> 00:30:28.930
There's the metallic
stove body that's

00:30:28.930 --> 00:30:32.180
the heat containing
functional part, and then

00:30:32.180 --> 00:30:35.210
the power electronics in
our power pack back here.

00:30:35.210 --> 00:30:38.420
And by making those two
somewhat modular and really

00:30:38.420 --> 00:30:41.260
simple to join to
one another, we

00:30:41.260 --> 00:30:43.580
can identify the
particular issue

00:30:43.580 --> 00:30:45.510
that a user might
have, and address that

00:30:45.510 --> 00:30:48.110
with just a component
replacement that our field

00:30:48.110 --> 00:30:51.060
agents are very capable of
implementing in the field.

00:30:51.060 --> 00:30:53.922
And so if the stove has
been in use for many years,

00:30:53.922 --> 00:30:55.630
maybe there is some
corrosion inside here

00:30:55.630 --> 00:30:57.270
and they need a new stove body.

00:30:57.270 --> 00:30:59.280
We can replace that with
the existing power pack

00:30:59.280 --> 00:31:01.320
they have at a reduced cost.

00:31:01.320 --> 00:31:05.880
If someone's thrown some liquid
inside the thing or someone's

00:31:05.880 --> 00:31:08.330
grabbed it and somehow
damaged the power pack,

00:31:08.330 --> 00:31:11.160
we can bring a
replacement power pack

00:31:11.160 --> 00:31:13.830
and split that supply
chain up a little bit.

00:31:13.830 --> 00:31:16.160
ETHAN KAY: And currently,
our average repair time

00:31:16.160 --> 00:31:19.560
across markets is three
days from the point

00:31:19.560 --> 00:31:22.000
that the customer experiences
an issue to the point

00:31:22.000 --> 00:31:23.306
that it's been solved for.

00:31:23.306 --> 00:31:27.280
So we've tried to decentralize
after sales service

00:31:27.280 --> 00:31:32.583
to allow for very
efficient repairs.

00:31:32.583 --> 00:31:33.291
AUDIENCE: Thanks.

00:31:33.291 --> 00:31:35.014
ETHAN KAY: Thanks.

00:31:35.014 --> 00:31:35.680
AUDIENCE: Hello.

00:31:35.680 --> 00:31:36.699
I have two questions.

00:31:36.699 --> 00:31:38.490
First, I want to know
if you had considered

00:31:38.490 --> 00:31:42.040
creating a bigger opening
for bigger pieces of wood.

00:31:42.040 --> 00:31:44.760
And the other question is,
could you please describe again

00:31:44.760 --> 00:31:47.224
how you reduced the smoke.

00:31:47.224 --> 00:31:47.890
RYAN GIST: Sure.

00:31:47.890 --> 00:31:48.620
AUDIENCE: Thank you.

00:31:48.620 --> 00:31:49.410
RYAN GIST: I'll
take both of those.

00:31:49.410 --> 00:31:51.250
You must be a
stove user yourself

00:31:51.250 --> 00:31:54.820
because that's the number one
feedback we get in the regions

00:31:54.820 --> 00:31:57.320
that we operate is like, we
need a bigger fuel mouth.

00:31:57.320 --> 00:32:01.490
Oftentimes, people are literally
tearing limbs off of trees

00:32:01.490 --> 00:32:03.925
and lighting the end of it
and continually feeding that

00:32:03.925 --> 00:32:04.550
into the stove.

00:32:04.550 --> 00:32:07.730
So that's definitely something
we're working to optimize.

00:32:07.730 --> 00:32:09.470
There is a new version
of this stove that

00:32:09.470 --> 00:32:10.360
will be coming out this year.

00:32:10.360 --> 00:32:12.180
The mouth has been
increased a little bit.

00:32:12.180 --> 00:32:15.080
But the trade there is
that as you open the mouth,

00:32:15.080 --> 00:32:17.760
you're now exposing all
that heat and radiation

00:32:17.760 --> 00:32:19.590
to the environment.

00:32:19.590 --> 00:32:22.514
And that's really one of the
key factors of the rocket stove

00:32:22.514 --> 00:32:24.430
architecture that we
talked about a minute ago

00:32:24.430 --> 00:32:26.410
is that by containing
all of that

00:32:26.410 --> 00:32:29.550
and not allowing the radiation
to get out into the world,

00:32:29.550 --> 00:32:31.740
you're improving the fuel
efficiency of the stove.

00:32:31.740 --> 00:32:33.300
So there's kind of
a balancing point.

00:32:33.300 --> 00:32:35.450
And we're trying to find out
exactly where that point is.

00:32:35.450 --> 00:32:38.010
We believe it's a little bit
larger than what you see here,

00:32:38.010 --> 00:32:42.480
but not so much larger that we
really lose fuel efficiency.

00:32:42.480 --> 00:32:44.690
And in terms of
eliminating the smoke,

00:32:44.690 --> 00:32:47.370
it's really just chemistry.

00:32:47.370 --> 00:32:49.430
I have a background in
aerospace engineering.

00:32:49.430 --> 00:32:51.430
I did combustion engineering
at my previous job.

00:32:51.430 --> 00:32:54.160
And it's really all about
getting intimate contact

00:32:54.160 --> 00:32:56.550
with fuel molecules
and oxygen molecules,

00:32:56.550 --> 00:32:58.770
and making sure they
can interact in a place

00:32:58.770 --> 00:33:00.170
where they're nice and hot.

00:33:00.170 --> 00:33:03.680
And so in a typical
fire, you've got a bunch

00:33:03.680 --> 00:33:05.040
of fuel coming off of the wood.

00:33:05.040 --> 00:33:08.230
And then it's got to
pull air from the outside

00:33:08.230 --> 00:33:09.784
to react with that.

00:33:09.784 --> 00:33:11.950
But there's too much fuel
in the middle and too much

00:33:11.950 --> 00:33:12.741
air on the outside.

00:33:12.741 --> 00:33:15.180
And somewhere in between
is where the flame happens.

00:33:15.180 --> 00:33:17.220
And where there's too
much fuel, often that

00:33:17.220 --> 00:33:18.760
will cool off and
then be unburned.

00:33:18.760 --> 00:33:21.630
And that's the particulate
smoke, either in droplets

00:33:21.630 --> 00:33:24.420
or solid particles
that get emitted.

00:33:24.420 --> 00:33:27.510
By injecting air
at high velocity,

00:33:27.510 --> 00:33:30.810
we swirl all that stuff together
so that the big chunks of fuel

00:33:30.810 --> 00:33:33.290
and the big pockets of air
get intimate with each other

00:33:33.290 --> 00:33:35.410
and can really mix and
allow that chemistry

00:33:35.410 --> 00:33:37.700
to happen in the environment
where it's nice and hot.

00:33:37.700 --> 00:33:39.580
And you get complete combustion.

00:33:39.580 --> 00:33:42.157
All the fuel gets converted.

00:33:42.157 --> 00:33:42.990
AUDIENCE: Thank you.

00:33:42.990 --> 00:33:45.270
ETHAN KAY: Thanks.

00:33:45.270 --> 00:33:47.560
AUDIENCE: Hi, thanks for
coming and talking to us.

00:33:47.560 --> 00:33:48.210
Two questions.

00:33:48.210 --> 00:33:50.540
What are the metallic
parts made of,

00:33:50.540 --> 00:33:52.390
like the ones outside
the bigger parts?

00:33:52.390 --> 00:33:54.520
And then how does
the financing usually

00:33:54.520 --> 00:33:57.550
work for people who are
buying these stoves?

00:33:57.550 --> 00:33:59.242
RYAN GIST: Sure.

00:33:59.242 --> 00:34:00.950
There's a combination
of different alloys

00:34:00.950 --> 00:34:03.680
in the stove that are used
in different locations,

00:34:03.680 --> 00:34:06.300
based on the temperature
that they're exposed to,

00:34:06.300 --> 00:34:08.679
based on the
chemistry in the wood,

00:34:08.679 --> 00:34:11.580
whether it be sulphur or
chlorine that may be attacking

00:34:11.580 --> 00:34:13.632
it in a corrosion mechanism.

00:34:13.632 --> 00:34:15.090
You see a lot of
cast iron on here.

00:34:15.090 --> 00:34:18.540
Cast iron is attributed
to durability

00:34:18.540 --> 00:34:19.719
in the markets we operate.

00:34:19.719 --> 00:34:21.719
And people really
trust that material.

00:34:21.719 --> 00:34:24.280
So we always use cast iron
on the top of the stove.

00:34:24.280 --> 00:34:27.239
In this version, there was some
cast iron in the main chamber.

00:34:27.239 --> 00:34:31.710
We've since gone away from
that and gone to an alloy

00:34:31.710 --> 00:34:32.409
that we can use.

00:34:32.409 --> 00:34:35.139
In a thinner wall, we can
reduce weight and cost

00:34:35.139 --> 00:34:37.610
in the stove, which really
improves the last mile

00:34:37.610 --> 00:34:39.636
distribution that Ethan
was talking about.

00:34:39.636 --> 00:34:41.969
When you use you cast iron,
the stove gets pretty heavy.

00:34:41.969 --> 00:34:44.170
And so for someone
on a motorcycle,

00:34:44.170 --> 00:34:46.176
they can only carry one or two.

00:34:46.176 --> 00:34:47.550
The next generation
of this thing

00:34:47.550 --> 00:34:50.440
will be able to carry four,
maybe five, on a motorcycle,

00:34:50.440 --> 00:34:51.960
and get the same
kind of durability

00:34:51.960 --> 00:34:55.040
by using a higher performance
alloy rather than the cast

00:34:55.040 --> 00:34:55.540
iron.

00:34:55.540 --> 00:34:56.710
So it's a whole mix.

00:34:56.710 --> 00:34:59.720
And we work really closely
with Oak Ridge National

00:34:59.720 --> 00:35:03.080
Labs and their combustion
and corrosion lab

00:35:03.080 --> 00:35:06.480
to really find the
optimum materials.

00:35:06.480 --> 00:35:08.760
Typically, really
corrosion resistant,

00:35:08.760 --> 00:35:10.740
heat resistant materials
are very expensive.

00:35:10.740 --> 00:35:12.800
So it's another one of
these balancing acts

00:35:12.800 --> 00:35:15.850
where we have to find the
right trade between cost

00:35:15.850 --> 00:35:17.000
and durability.

00:35:17.000 --> 00:35:19.460
I think we're really close.

00:35:19.460 --> 00:35:21.700
With respect to your
financing question,

00:35:21.700 --> 00:35:25.480
in our first year of operations,
all of our stoves sold

00:35:25.480 --> 00:35:27.710
were with upfront cash.

00:35:27.710 --> 00:35:33.720
So customers would
pay 50-odd dollars

00:35:33.720 --> 00:35:37.820
in cash, which obviously is
a substantial amount of money

00:35:37.820 --> 00:35:39.480
relative to incomes.

00:35:39.480 --> 00:35:42.110
But to our surprise,
we sold stoves

00:35:42.110 --> 00:35:45.980
faster than we had expected
a higher than modeled

00:35:45.980 --> 00:35:47.590
retail price.

00:35:47.590 --> 00:35:49.720
But we realized that
we were probably

00:35:49.720 --> 00:35:55.800
only skimming the more affluent
parts of our target market.

00:35:55.800 --> 00:36:01.050
And so starting in 2015,
we focused exclusively

00:36:01.050 --> 00:36:04.340
on launching what we called
credit-enabled distribution

00:36:04.340 --> 00:36:04.940
channels.

00:36:04.940 --> 00:36:09.790
So these include banks,
microfinance organizations,

00:36:09.790 --> 00:36:13.550
and producer cooperatives
that provide loans to farmers.

00:36:13.550 --> 00:36:18.130
And in those models, the
flavors of financing vary.

00:36:18.130 --> 00:36:24.610
But for instance, in India
our main microfinance partner

00:36:24.610 --> 00:36:29.200
finances the stove for
$2 a month for two years.

00:36:29.200 --> 00:36:31.190
And that obviously
has dramatically

00:36:31.190 --> 00:36:33.450
widened the addressable
market of people that can

00:36:33.450 --> 00:36:34.878
afford to purchase the stove.

00:36:36.715 --> 00:36:37.840
AUDIENCE: Hey, there, guys.

00:36:37.840 --> 00:36:38.810
Thanks for coming.

00:36:38.810 --> 00:36:39.870
So a two-part question.

00:36:39.870 --> 00:36:41.710
One is what's the
order of magnitude

00:36:41.710 --> 00:36:44.510
of the number of stoves that
are in the hands of actual end

00:36:44.510 --> 00:36:45.230
users.

00:36:45.230 --> 00:36:48.945
And also, what's for you
guys the next 10x market?

00:36:48.945 --> 00:36:50.320
Which market are
you most excited

00:36:50.320 --> 00:36:52.670
about in the developing world?

00:36:52.670 --> 00:36:55.580
RYAN GIST: I mean,
you got those numbers.

00:36:55.580 --> 00:36:59.800
ETHAN KAY: So to date, we've
kept production and sales

00:36:59.800 --> 00:37:07.770
to 15,000 units, in order to
A, validate product market fit

00:37:07.770 --> 00:37:12.470
with customers, B, refine
our business model, and C,

00:37:12.470 --> 00:37:15.630
figure out these questions
around financing.

00:37:15.630 --> 00:37:19.340
With the launch of the new
stove that Ryan described,

00:37:19.340 --> 00:37:21.550
we're going to
have a product that

00:37:21.550 --> 00:37:24.060
is lower cost with
a stronger feature

00:37:24.060 --> 00:37:28.460
set, which is timed for us to
start scaling our operations.

00:37:28.460 --> 00:37:32.710
The plan is to continue to
remain in India and East Africa

00:37:32.710 --> 00:37:38.680
as our core markets and
to sell a million stoves

00:37:38.680 --> 00:37:41.652
over the next five years.

00:37:41.652 --> 00:37:42.360
AUDIENCE: Thanks.

00:37:42.360 --> 00:37:43.090
ETHAN KAY: Thanks.

00:37:43.090 --> 00:37:43.964
RYAN GIST: Thank you.

00:37:46.599 --> 00:37:47.140
AUDIENCE: Hi.

00:37:47.140 --> 00:37:47.723
RYAN GIST: Hi.

00:37:47.723 --> 00:37:49.440
AUDIENCE: Let's
say someone who saw

00:37:49.440 --> 00:37:51.940
this BioLite in the
YouTube or something

00:37:51.940 --> 00:37:54.360
there and like thing,
someone in India.

00:37:54.360 --> 00:37:57.060
And if they want to, let's
say, affiliate with you

00:37:57.060 --> 00:37:59.670
or are an NGO member who
wants to publicize this.

00:37:59.670 --> 00:38:01.160
What are the steps
that someone has

00:38:01.160 --> 00:38:04.010
to go through to create
[? others of this ?]

00:38:04.010 --> 00:38:06.945
or want to finance this
or sell these things?

00:38:06.945 --> 00:38:07.820
Like that.

00:38:07.820 --> 00:38:08.670
ETHAN KAY: Sure.

00:38:08.670 --> 00:38:13.450
Well, firstly, to put
them in touch with us.

00:38:13.450 --> 00:38:15.520
Especially with India
being a key market,

00:38:15.520 --> 00:38:19.200
we'd be thrilled to talk to
any potential distribution

00:38:19.200 --> 00:38:22.220
partners, marketing
partners, et cetera.

00:38:22.220 --> 00:38:25.880
We currently have operations in
India in the state of Odisha,

00:38:25.880 --> 00:38:29.170
which is in the east,
Rajastan, which is in the west,

00:38:29.170 --> 00:38:34.210
and have also run operations
in the northeast in Assam,

00:38:34.210 --> 00:38:37.050
Mizoram, Nagaland, et cetera.

00:38:37.050 --> 00:38:40.720
And so we have teams on the
ground in each of those markets

00:38:40.720 --> 00:38:45.570
who anyone in your
network who is interested

00:38:45.570 --> 00:38:48.740
can reach out to through us.

00:38:48.740 --> 00:38:50.430
Thanks.

00:38:50.430 --> 00:38:52.671
AUDIENCE: In terms
of size for people--

00:38:52.671 --> 00:38:54.670
I mean, there have been
a number of technologies

00:38:54.670 --> 00:38:57.430
that have been attempted to use
for this, like solar stoves.

00:38:57.430 --> 00:39:02.300
How do you compare, in
terms of size of market

00:39:02.300 --> 00:39:04.124
and in terms of
installed base, compared

00:39:04.124 --> 00:39:05.540
to some of these
other things that

00:39:05.540 --> 00:39:10.228
have been used for the reduction
in pollution and the like?

00:39:12.860 --> 00:39:14.370
ETHAN KAY: Maybe I can start.

00:39:14.370 --> 00:39:15.249
RYAN GIST: Go for it.

00:39:15.249 --> 00:39:17.040
ETHAN KAY: And forgive
a bit of snark here.

00:39:19.840 --> 00:39:24.150
As we were saying in the
talk, that taste of food

00:39:24.150 --> 00:39:26.050
is really culturally specific.

00:39:26.050 --> 00:39:31.650
And from my experience,
and there are exceptions,

00:39:31.650 --> 00:39:34.700
but from my experience,
cooking on a solar stove

00:39:34.700 --> 00:39:37.580
is the equivalent of trying
to microwave a steak.

00:39:37.580 --> 00:39:40.840
And who wants to eat
a microwaved steak?

00:39:40.840 --> 00:39:42.442
There are a few
problems with it.

00:39:42.442 --> 00:39:46.350
One, you need a lot of sunlight.

00:39:46.350 --> 00:39:50.530
And during the monsoon season,
for instance, in India,

00:39:50.530 --> 00:39:54.170
or in the evening, that's
obviously a challenge.

00:39:54.170 --> 00:39:58.130
Secondly, food takes
a really long time

00:39:58.130 --> 00:40:00.040
to prepare on a solar cooker.

00:40:00.040 --> 00:40:03.160
So it's like slow
cooking in the US.

00:40:03.160 --> 00:40:05.860
So you put the food on in
the cooker in the morning.

00:40:05.860 --> 00:40:08.454
You hope it stays sunny all day.

00:40:08.454 --> 00:40:09.870
And in the evening,
you have food.

00:40:09.870 --> 00:40:12.890
But for instance, you
can't make a roti,

00:40:12.890 --> 00:40:15.735
a flat bread on a solar cooker.

00:40:15.735 --> 00:40:17.110
And as I was
joking, you probably

00:40:17.110 --> 00:40:21.069
wouldn't want to grill
your steak on one.

00:40:21.069 --> 00:40:22.610
RYAN GIST: I mean,
you said it great.

00:40:22.610 --> 00:40:25.240
I don't think there's too much
more to add to that, really.

00:40:25.240 --> 00:40:27.920
ETHAN KAY: So yeah, so
solar cookers, I think,

00:40:27.920 --> 00:40:30.100
are appropriate in some
contexts and have gained

00:40:30.100 --> 00:40:31.650
some traction in some contexts.

00:40:31.650 --> 00:40:35.300
But half the planet,
as we were saying,

00:40:35.300 --> 00:40:37.820
cooks with wood, cow
dung, and crop waste.

00:40:37.820 --> 00:40:40.850
And we really feel as a
business that our goal

00:40:40.850 --> 00:40:45.120
is to meet users where they are
in terms of the types of fuels

00:40:45.120 --> 00:40:47.880
that they have available, the
types of dishes that they like

00:40:47.880 --> 00:40:50.060
to cook, and ensuring
that the taste is

00:40:50.060 --> 00:40:52.540
consistent with the meals
that they prepared before

00:40:52.540 --> 00:40:54.810
on an open fire.

00:40:54.810 --> 00:40:56.910
AUDIENCE: So I
just had a question

00:40:56.910 --> 00:41:02.380
about how much of a piece of
wood is, say, incombustible.

00:41:02.380 --> 00:41:03.720
What is perfect?

00:41:03.720 --> 00:41:05.900
And how close are you
to perfect when it

00:41:05.900 --> 00:41:07.360
comes to combusting everything?

00:41:07.360 --> 00:41:08.580
RYAN GIST: Sure.

00:41:08.580 --> 00:41:13.080
I mean, wood is primarily carbon
and hydrogen, mostly carbon.

00:41:13.080 --> 00:41:16.040
When we talk about
burning to completion,

00:41:16.040 --> 00:41:17.610
we can burn all that carbon.

00:41:17.610 --> 00:41:22.030
So there's maybe on an
average piece of wood 3% to 8%

00:41:22.030 --> 00:41:23.240
that's mineral.

00:41:23.240 --> 00:41:25.930
And that's the only part
that's actually not burnable.

00:41:25.930 --> 00:41:29.610
So if you've ever seen the
leftovers after a fire,

00:41:29.610 --> 00:41:31.180
there's a lot of
big black chunks,

00:41:31.180 --> 00:41:33.040
which is the char or carbon.

00:41:33.040 --> 00:41:35.830
And then there's little
bits of white, stringy,

00:41:35.830 --> 00:41:37.040
spider-web-looking material.

00:41:37.040 --> 00:41:39.230
And that white stuff
is mineral ash.

00:41:39.230 --> 00:41:40.740
And that's the only
part of the wood

00:41:40.740 --> 00:41:42.800
that's completely unburnable.

00:41:42.800 --> 00:41:46.610
AUDIENCE: And does the
reduction in total carbon

00:41:46.610 --> 00:41:49.760
ash effect uses that people
have for their stoves?

00:41:49.760 --> 00:41:51.642
Do they have things
to do with the ash?

00:41:51.642 --> 00:41:53.100
RYAN GIST: That's
a great question.

00:41:53.100 --> 00:41:55.820
And we see that a lot,
although what happens

00:41:55.820 --> 00:41:59.810
is in some households, they're
ready to utilize that charcoal.

00:41:59.810 --> 00:42:01.890
And they may have a
specific charcoal stove

00:42:01.890 --> 00:42:02.820
that they might use.

00:42:02.820 --> 00:42:04.660
But in a lot of
homes, it just gets

00:42:04.660 --> 00:42:06.250
disregarded and passed off.

00:42:06.250 --> 00:42:08.104
So we feel like
it's better for us

00:42:08.104 --> 00:42:09.520
to go ahead and
burn that charcoal

00:42:09.520 --> 00:42:12.500
to completion, give them all
that heat energy for cooking.

00:42:12.500 --> 00:42:14.250
If they still need
to purchase or create

00:42:14.250 --> 00:42:16.960
charcoal for a different
cooking task, that's fine.

00:42:16.960 --> 00:42:19.810
But I think we'd rather cover
all those instances where

00:42:19.810 --> 00:42:21.610
people discard the charcoal.

00:42:21.610 --> 00:42:24.410
AUDIENCE: And finally, you
said you were moving away

00:42:24.410 --> 00:42:27.750
from cast iron to a different
alloy for the inner part?

00:42:27.750 --> 00:42:28.470
RYAN GIST: Yeah.

00:42:28.470 --> 00:42:33.180
AUDIENCE: So will that hurt
your ability to produce, say,

00:42:33.180 --> 00:42:36.050
the cast iron in country?

00:42:36.050 --> 00:42:37.750
Or I don't know
how to describe it.

00:42:37.750 --> 00:42:39.750
RYAN GIST: Yeah, I mean,
that's a fair question.

00:42:39.750 --> 00:42:42.940
And for the specific alloy
we're looking at right now,

00:42:42.940 --> 00:42:45.230
it would probably
have to be imported.

00:42:45.230 --> 00:42:47.070
And then the
manufacturing of that

00:42:47.070 --> 00:42:50.190
from sheet metal into finished
goods would happen in country.

00:42:50.190 --> 00:42:52.661
But I think that could still
be a major improvement.

00:42:52.661 --> 00:42:53.660
AUDIENCE: OK, thank you.

00:42:56.999 --> 00:42:58.540
AUDIENCE: I was just
wondering if you

00:42:58.540 --> 00:43:01.060
could provide just a few
technical specs, like what

00:43:01.060 --> 00:43:02.127
is the total mass.

00:43:02.127 --> 00:43:03.710
Is there a battery
in the orange unit?

00:43:03.710 --> 00:43:05.280
And if so, what's its capacity?

00:43:05.280 --> 00:43:08.930
What is the total power
output to the USB port?

00:43:08.930 --> 00:43:10.290
Some other stuff like that?

00:43:10.290 --> 00:43:11.550
RYAN GIST: Sure.

00:43:11.550 --> 00:43:14.360
So currently, there is
no battery in the stove.

00:43:14.360 --> 00:43:16.180
That adds cost,
again, to the product.

00:43:16.180 --> 00:43:18.930
And so until we can bring
the rest of the cost down,

00:43:18.930 --> 00:43:20.560
we're going to leave
the battery out.

00:43:20.560 --> 00:43:24.380
We are working both in our
outdoor recreation markets

00:43:24.380 --> 00:43:27.700
and in our emerging markets
on some lighting options that

00:43:27.700 --> 00:43:29.700
can utilize the USB
power from the stove

00:43:29.700 --> 00:43:32.570
to provide light, but also
have a battery on that side

00:43:32.570 --> 00:43:34.535
of the system to store things.

00:43:34.535 --> 00:43:36.660
So right now, there is no
battery storage capacity.

00:43:36.660 --> 00:43:39.240
The USB output is
about 2 and 1/2 watts.

00:43:39.240 --> 00:43:41.410
So that's very
comparable to say,

00:43:41.410 --> 00:43:44.040
the side of your laptop when
it's not plugged into the wall.

00:43:44.040 --> 00:43:45.390
If you just plug in
your phone on the side

00:43:45.390 --> 00:43:46.970
your laptop to
charge your phone,

00:43:46.970 --> 00:43:49.450
it's about the same kind
of current flow and power

00:43:49.450 --> 00:43:50.570
that you see.

00:43:50.570 --> 00:43:54.340
The next generation of the
stove will get another 20%, 25%

00:43:54.340 --> 00:43:56.880
improvement in that.

00:43:56.880 --> 00:44:00.140
AUDIENCE: And just the
total mass of the stove?

00:44:00.140 --> 00:44:02.891
RYAN GIST: Currently, this is
around six to eight kilograms,

00:44:02.891 --> 00:44:03.390
I believe.

00:44:03.390 --> 00:44:06.750
And the next one will cut
that significantly down

00:44:06.750 --> 00:44:08.670
below five kilograms.

00:44:08.670 --> 00:44:12.730
AUDIENCE: And are you worried,
as a possible perverse outcome

00:44:12.730 --> 00:44:14.332
of this, that people
will burn wood

00:44:14.332 --> 00:44:15.790
that they otherwise
would not have,

00:44:15.790 --> 00:44:17.195
just to charge their phone?

00:44:17.195 --> 00:44:18.820
RYAN GIST: That's
definitely a concern.

00:44:18.820 --> 00:44:21.860
I know Ethan and his team
have looked into that.

00:44:21.860 --> 00:44:23.260
ETHAN KAY: So, yeah.

00:44:23.260 --> 00:44:25.230
This was an initial
concern of ours.

00:44:25.230 --> 00:44:28.390
And after several
years of operations,

00:44:28.390 --> 00:44:30.400
not only have we never
seen that happen,

00:44:30.400 --> 00:44:40.000
but there is a PhD student at
Lawrence Berkeley Lab named

00:44:40.000 --> 00:44:45.580
Danny Wilson who did an
independent evaluation where

00:44:45.580 --> 00:44:49.630
he designed a stove
usage monitoring system.

00:44:49.630 --> 00:44:51.820
It was actually
to our camp stove,

00:44:51.820 --> 00:44:56.050
which is a product that wasn't
even designed for this market.

00:44:56.050 --> 00:44:58.400
And he looked at
whether people are

00:44:58.400 --> 00:45:03.270
using a camp stove for
charging and not for cooking.

00:45:03.270 --> 00:45:05.860
And again, that product
wasn't even designed

00:45:05.860 --> 00:45:08.170
for cooking in that market.

00:45:08.170 --> 00:45:12.870
And what he found was not only
were people not using the stove

00:45:12.870 --> 00:45:14.640
just for charging.

00:45:14.640 --> 00:45:18.070
The version of the
stove that had charging,

00:45:18.070 --> 00:45:21.190
households were using
it way more for cooking.

00:45:21.190 --> 00:45:25.190
So the inclusion of the
electricity generation

00:45:25.190 --> 00:45:29.120
actually increased
usage for cooking,

00:45:29.120 --> 00:45:31.100
while they were
co-generating power,

00:45:31.100 --> 00:45:34.320
but did not have the perverse
effect of customers using it

00:45:34.320 --> 00:45:37.050
just for charging.

00:45:37.050 --> 00:45:40.640
AUDIENCE: And as I often see
with really cool products

00:45:40.640 --> 00:45:43.909
like this, it's just not
available for purchase here,

00:45:43.909 --> 00:45:45.700
for people who want to
play around with it.

00:45:45.700 --> 00:45:50.090
Like, can I go out and buy that?

00:45:50.090 --> 00:45:55.790
ETHAN KAY: So in response
to people like you,

00:45:55.790 --> 00:45:59.640
we launched, I guess, last year?

00:45:59.640 --> 00:46:00.470
RYAN GIST: 2014.

00:46:00.470 --> 00:46:04.850
ETHAN KAY: 2014, middle
of 2014, a version

00:46:04.850 --> 00:46:09.860
of this product called the
BaseCamp, which is essentially

00:46:09.860 --> 00:46:11.810
a backyard barbecue.

00:46:11.810 --> 00:46:15.820
So it has the same
chassis or body of this.

00:46:15.820 --> 00:46:17.690
But it has a
different top, which

00:46:17.690 --> 00:46:20.880
can be used both for
grilling and as a stove.

00:46:20.880 --> 00:46:22.550
You flip a lever.

00:46:22.550 --> 00:46:26.180
And it switches back and
forth between a diffuse flame

00:46:26.180 --> 00:46:29.160
for making a bunch of burgers
and a concentrated flame

00:46:29.160 --> 00:46:31.630
for making soup.

00:46:31.630 --> 00:46:34.430
It also has legs on
it so that you don't

00:46:34.430 --> 00:46:36.960
have to crouch on the ground.

00:46:36.960 --> 00:46:38.670
It has a battery on board.

00:46:38.670 --> 00:46:41.770
It produces twice as much
power as this version.

00:46:41.770 --> 00:46:44.180
And we launched that
product on Kickstarter.

00:46:44.180 --> 00:46:48.040
And I think it was the 20th
most successful Kickstarter

00:46:48.040 --> 00:46:50.310
product in Kickstarter history.

00:46:50.310 --> 00:46:53.140
So you can go either
to our website

00:46:53.140 --> 00:46:56.950
or to REI or any other
outdoor retail store

00:46:56.950 --> 00:46:58.345
to buy the BaseCamp.

00:46:58.345 --> 00:46:59.215
AUDIENCE: Thanks.

00:46:59.215 --> 00:46:59.965
ETHAN KAY: Thanks.

00:47:03.724 --> 00:47:04.890
MALE SPEAKER: Thanks, gents.

00:47:04.890 --> 00:47:06.223
RYAN GIST: Yeah, thank you guys.

00:47:06.223 --> 00:47:10.320
