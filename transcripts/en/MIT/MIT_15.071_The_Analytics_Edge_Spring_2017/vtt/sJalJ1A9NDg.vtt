00:00:09.580 --> 00:00:13.280
Recommendation systems are
used in many different areas

00:00:13.280 --> 00:00:15.150
other than movies.

00:00:15.150 --> 00:00:18.960
Jeff Bezos, the
CEO of Amazon, said

00:00:18.960 --> 00:00:22.110
that, "If I have 3 million
customers on the web,

00:00:22.110 --> 00:00:25.430
I should have 3 million
stores on the web."

00:00:25.430 --> 00:00:28.700
The internet allows for
mass personalization,

00:00:28.700 --> 00:00:32.439
and recommendation systems
are a key part of that.

00:00:32.439 --> 00:00:34.560
Recommendation
systems build models

00:00:34.560 --> 00:00:37.990
about users' preferences
to personalize the user

00:00:37.990 --> 00:00:39.620
experience.

00:00:39.620 --> 00:00:43.340
This helps users find items they
might not have searched for,

00:00:43.340 --> 00:00:45.990
like a new favorite
band, an old friend who

00:00:45.990 --> 00:00:49.740
uses the same social media
network, or a book or song

00:00:49.740 --> 00:00:52.730
that they're likely to enjoy.

00:00:52.730 --> 00:00:55.260
Recommendation systems
are a cornerstone

00:00:55.260 --> 00:00:57.450
of these top businesses.

00:00:57.450 --> 00:01:00.170
Social networking
sites, like Facebook,

00:01:00.170 --> 00:01:04.150
music streaming sites, like
Pandora, and retail companies,

00:01:04.150 --> 00:01:07.610
like Amazon, all provide
recommendation systems

00:01:07.610 --> 00:01:09.860
for their users.

00:01:09.860 --> 00:01:12.840
Both collaborative filtering
and content filtering

00:01:12.840 --> 00:01:14.740
are used in practice.

00:01:14.740 --> 00:01:17.230
Collaborative filtering
is used by companies

00:01:17.230 --> 00:01:20.850
like Amazon, Facebook,
and Google News.

00:01:20.850 --> 00:01:23.080
Content filtering
is used by companies

00:01:23.080 --> 00:01:27.380
like Pandora, Rotten
Tomatoes, and See This Next.

00:01:27.380 --> 00:01:30.420
And Netflix uses both
collaborative filtering

00:01:30.420 --> 00:01:33.890
and content filtering.

00:01:33.890 --> 00:01:37.120
So now let's go back
to the Netflix prize.

00:01:37.120 --> 00:01:42.789
29 days after last call was
announced, on July 25, 2009,

00:01:42.789 --> 00:01:49.020
the team The Ensemble submitted
a 10.09% improvement, beating

00:01:49.020 --> 00:01:52.700
the 10.05% improvement that
was submitted by Bellkor's

00:01:52.700 --> 00:01:56.190
Pragmatic Chaos to
signal last call.

00:01:56.190 --> 00:01:59.680
But by the time Netflix stopped
accepting submissions the next

00:01:59.680 --> 00:02:04.830
day, Bellkor's Pragmatic Chaos
had also submitted a 10.09%

00:02:04.830 --> 00:02:08.930
improvement, and The Ensemble
had submitted a 10.10%

00:02:08.930 --> 00:02:10.620
improvement.

00:02:10.620 --> 00:02:13.340
To really test the
algorithms, Netflix

00:02:13.340 --> 00:02:15.470
tested them on a
private test set

00:02:15.470 --> 00:02:17.800
that the teams had
never seen before.

00:02:17.800 --> 00:02:21.840
This is the true test
of predictive ability.

00:02:21.840 --> 00:02:26.480
On September 18, 2009, Netflix
announced that the winning team

00:02:26.480 --> 00:02:29.200
was Bellkor's Pragmatic Chaos.

00:02:29.200 --> 00:02:34.490
They won the competition and
the $1 million grand prize.

00:02:34.490 --> 00:02:37.470
Recommendation systems
provide a significant edge

00:02:37.470 --> 00:02:39.310
to many companies.

00:02:39.310 --> 00:02:42.860
In today's digital age,
businesses often have hundreds

00:02:42.860 --> 00:02:45.980
of thousands of items to
offer their customers,

00:02:45.980 --> 00:02:49.640
whether they're movies, songs
, or people they might know

00:02:49.640 --> 00:02:51.340
on Facebook.

00:02:51.340 --> 00:02:54.160
Excellent recommendation
systems can make or break

00:02:54.160 --> 00:02:56.140
these businesses.

00:02:56.140 --> 00:02:58.430
Clustering algorithms,
which are tailored

00:02:58.430 --> 00:03:01.970
to find similar customers
or similar items,

00:03:01.970 --> 00:03:06.030
form the backbone of many of
these recommendation systems.

00:03:06.030 --> 00:03:10.050
Clustering also has many other
interesting applications.

00:03:10.050 --> 00:03:12.720
In the next lecture,
we'll see how clustering

00:03:12.720 --> 00:03:16.060
can be used to improve
the predictive ability

00:03:16.060 --> 00:03:18.650
of classification methods.
