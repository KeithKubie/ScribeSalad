00:03:41.460 --> 00:03:41.470
meaning lots of ways to do it and and
 

00:03:41.470 --> 00:03:43.409
meaning lots of ways to do it and and
maybe the best example is to think about

00:03:43.409 --> 00:03:43.419
maybe the best example is to think about
 

00:03:43.419 --> 00:03:46.379
maybe the best example is to think about
the open source community one of the

00:03:46.379 --> 00:03:46.389
the open source community one of the
 

00:03:46.389 --> 00:03:47.819
the open source community one of the
things that happen in the open source

00:03:47.819 --> 00:03:47.829
things that happen in the open source
 

00:03:47.829 --> 00:03:49.949
things that happen in the open source
community is that there was a legal

00:03:49.949 --> 00:03:49.959
community is that there was a legal
 

00:03:49.959 --> 00:03:53.670
community is that there was a legal
advance where they basically agreed that

00:03:53.670 --> 00:03:53.680
advance where they basically agreed that
 

00:03:53.680 --> 00:03:55.259
advance where they basically agreed that
everybody who writes a piece of code

00:03:55.259 --> 00:03:55.269
everybody who writes a piece of code
 

00:03:55.269 --> 00:03:58.170
everybody who writes a piece of code
their name would always be connected to

00:03:58.170 --> 00:03:58.180
their name would always be connected to
 

00:03:58.180 --> 00:04:00.869
their name would always be connected to
it now you could say why who cares

00:04:00.869 --> 00:04:00.879
it now you could say why who cares
 

00:04:00.879 --> 00:04:03.689
it now you could say why who cares
people care if your name is connected to

00:04:03.689 --> 00:04:03.699
people care if your name is connected to
 

00:04:03.699 --> 00:04:05.999
people care if your name is connected to
a piece of code you're going to maintain

00:04:05.999 --> 00:04:06.009
a piece of code you're going to maintain
 

00:04:06.009 --> 00:04:09.270
a piece of code you're going to maintain
that piece of code forever there was a

00:04:09.270 --> 00:04:09.280
that piece of code forever there was a
 

00:04:09.280 --> 00:04:10.979
that piece of code forever there was a
period in time where people were worried

00:04:10.979 --> 00:04:10.989
period in time where people were worried
 

00:04:10.989 --> 00:04:12.569
period in time where people were worried
about getting open source software

00:04:12.569 --> 00:04:12.579
about getting open source software
 

00:04:12.579 --> 00:04:15.390
about getting open source software
because who's going to maintain it if

00:04:15.390 --> 00:04:15.400
because who's going to maintain it if
 

00:04:15.400 --> 00:04:17.819
because who's going to maintain it if
your name is connected to it you're

00:04:17.819 --> 00:04:17.829
your name is connected to it you're
 

00:04:17.829 --> 00:04:19.770
your name is connected to it you're
going to you're going to maintain it and

00:04:19.770 --> 00:04:19.780
going to you're going to maintain it and
 

00:04:19.780 --> 00:04:21.449
going to you're going to maintain it and
indeed people maintain all kinds of

00:04:21.449 --> 00:04:21.459
indeed people maintain all kinds of
 

00:04:21.459 --> 00:04:24.149
indeed people maintain all kinds of
software all kinds of unlikely events

00:04:24.149 --> 00:04:24.159
software all kinds of unlikely events
 

00:04:24.159 --> 00:04:26.879
software all kinds of unlikely events
and and people invest in it and knowing

00:04:26.879 --> 00:04:26.889
and and people invest in it and knowing
 

00:04:26.889 --> 00:04:27.690
and and people invest in it and knowing
that if I could

00:04:27.690 --> 00:04:27.700
that if I could
 

00:04:27.700 --> 00:04:29.430
that if I could
ate something and other people build on

00:04:29.430 --> 00:04:29.440
ate something and other people build on
 

00:04:29.440 --> 00:04:32.640
ate something and other people build on
it it would always have my name in my

00:04:32.640 --> 00:04:32.650
it it would always have my name in my
 

00:04:32.650 --> 00:04:34.290
it it would always have my name in my
connection and my sense of contribution

00:04:34.290 --> 00:04:34.300
connection and my sense of contribution
 

00:04:34.300 --> 00:04:37.860
connection and my sense of contribution
is incredibly motivating so just think

00:04:37.860 --> 00:04:37.870
is incredibly motivating so just think
 

00:04:37.870 --> 00:04:40.920
is incredibly motivating so just think
about that that simple idea of where do

00:04:40.920 --> 00:04:40.930
about that that simple idea of where do
 

00:04:40.930 --> 00:04:44.160
about that that simple idea of where do
we put people's names on every piece of

00:04:44.160 --> 00:04:44.170
we put people's names on every piece of
 

00:04:44.170 --> 00:04:47.220
we put people's names on every piece of
software like why and the hood of the

00:04:47.220 --> 00:04:47.230
software like why and the hood of the
 

00:04:47.230 --> 00:04:48.930
software like why and the hood of the
car all the people who are involved

00:04:48.930 --> 00:04:48.940
car all the people who are involved
 

00:04:48.940 --> 00:04:50.820

could you know sign your name in a very

00:04:50.820 --> 00:04:50.830
could you know sign your name in a very
 

00:04:50.830 --> 00:04:53.310
could you know sign your name in a very
small small print and then of course

00:04:53.310 --> 00:04:53.320
small small print and then of course
 

00:04:53.320 --> 00:04:54.810
small small print and then of course
there's other things right it's not just

00:04:54.810 --> 00:04:54.820
there's other things right it's not just
 

00:04:54.820 --> 00:04:58.500
there's other things right it's not just
about name association it's about the

00:04:58.500 --> 00:04:58.510
about name association it's about the
 

00:04:58.510 --> 00:05:02.010
about name association it's about the
feeling of contribution and the feeling

00:05:02.010 --> 00:05:02.020
feeling of contribution and the feeling
 

00:05:02.020 --> 00:05:03.900
feeling of contribution and the feeling
that you ever say autonomy right that

00:05:03.900 --> 00:05:03.910
that you ever say autonomy right that
 

00:05:03.910 --> 00:05:05.820
that you ever say autonomy right that
you're not just told what you're going

00:05:05.820 --> 00:05:05.830
you're not just told what you're going
 

00:05:05.830 --> 00:05:10.050
you're not just told what you're going
to do it's that you are doing it there's

00:05:10.050 --> 00:05:10.060
to do it's that you are doing it there's
 

00:05:10.060 --> 00:05:13.200

a very cute experiment in which they

00:05:13.200 --> 00:05:13.210
a very cute experiment in which they
 

00:05:13.210 --> 00:05:16.890
a very cute experiment in which they
take kids they come with their mother to

00:05:16.890 --> 00:05:16.900
take kids they come with their mother to
 

00:05:16.900 --> 00:05:18.990
take kids they come with their mother to
a lab and they go into a separate room

00:05:18.990 --> 00:05:19.000
a lab and they go into a separate room
 

00:05:19.000 --> 00:05:21.300
a lab and they go into a separate room
with the research assistant and they do

00:05:21.300 --> 00:05:21.310
with the research assistant and they do
 

00:05:21.310 --> 00:05:24.060
with the research assistant and they do
it drawing together and one time the

00:05:24.060 --> 00:05:24.070
it drawing together and one time the
 

00:05:24.070 --> 00:05:25.710
it drawing together and one time the
research assistant does the drawing and

00:05:25.710 --> 00:05:25.720
research assistant does the drawing and
 

00:05:25.720 --> 00:05:28.020
research assistant does the drawing and
the kid tells them what to do so the

00:05:28.020 --> 00:05:28.030
the kid tells them what to do so the
 

00:05:28.030 --> 00:05:29.400
the kid tells them what to do so the
kids give the instructions and the

00:05:29.400 --> 00:05:29.410
kids give the instructions and the
 

00:05:29.410 --> 00:05:31.230
kids give the instructions and the
research assistant does the mechanical

00:05:31.230 --> 00:05:31.240
research assistant does the mechanical
 

00:05:31.240 --> 00:05:34.470
research assistant does the mechanical
work another condition the research

00:05:34.470 --> 00:05:34.480
work another condition the research
 

00:05:34.480 --> 00:05:36.510
work another condition the research
assistant gives the instruction and the

00:05:36.510 --> 00:05:36.520
assistant gives the instruction and the
 

00:05:36.520 --> 00:05:39.210
assistant gives the instruction and the
kids the kid does the the mechanical

00:05:39.210 --> 00:05:39.220
kids the kid does the the mechanical
 

00:05:39.220 --> 00:05:42.030
kids the kid does the the mechanical
work and then as they finish it the

00:05:42.030 --> 00:05:42.040
work and then as they finish it the
 

00:05:42.040 --> 00:05:44.070
work and then as they finish it the
research assistant take the take the

00:05:44.070 --> 00:05:44.080
research assistant take the take the
 

00:05:44.080 --> 00:05:46.920
research assistant take the take the
drawing in their hand go out of the room

00:05:46.920 --> 00:05:46.930
drawing in their hand go out of the room
 

00:05:46.930 --> 00:05:49.530
drawing in their hand go out of the room
first before the kid shows it to the

00:05:49.530 --> 00:05:49.540
first before the kid shows it to the
 

00:05:49.540 --> 00:05:52.530
first before the kid shows it to the
mother and says look what I did and the

00:05:52.530 --> 00:05:52.540
mother and says look what I did and the
 

00:05:52.540 --> 00:05:54.180
mother and says look what I did and the
question is when will the kid be more

00:05:54.180 --> 00:05:54.190
question is when will the kid be more
 

00:05:54.190 --> 00:05:57.270
question is when will the kid be more
upset right so so the the rigid this is

00:05:57.270 --> 00:05:57.280
upset right so so the the rigid this is
 

00:05:57.280 --> 00:05:58.950

a basically takes credit for the kids
 

00:05:58.960 --> 00:06:02.160
a basically takes credit for the kids
job when will the kid be more upset when

00:06:02.160 --> 00:06:02.170
job when will the kid be more upset when
 

00:06:02.170 --> 00:06:04.230
job when will the kid be more upset when
the kid did the drawing but the idea was

00:06:04.230 --> 00:06:04.240
the kid did the drawing but the idea was
 

00:06:04.240 --> 00:06:06.870
the kid did the drawing but the idea was
somebody else or when the idea was the

00:06:06.870 --> 00:06:06.880
somebody else or when the idea was the
 

00:06:06.880 --> 00:06:08.580
somebody else or when the idea was the
kid and somebody else did the mechanical

00:06:08.580 --> 00:06:08.590
kid and somebody else did the mechanical
 

00:06:08.590 --> 00:06:11.190
kid and somebody else did the mechanical
thing and the kids get more upset when

00:06:11.190 --> 00:06:11.200
thing and the kids get more upset when
 

00:06:11.200 --> 00:06:14.330
thing and the kids get more upset when
it was their idea which was their idea

00:06:14.330 --> 00:06:14.340
it was their idea which was their idea
 

00:06:14.340 --> 00:06:17.880
it was their idea which was their idea
think about how much we don't give

00:06:17.880 --> 00:06:17.890
think about how much we don't give
 

00:06:17.890 --> 00:06:20.820
think about how much we don't give
credit in this world to other people's

00:06:20.820 --> 00:06:20.830
credit in this world to other people's
 

00:06:20.830 --> 00:06:24.240
credit in this world to other people's
ideas how many people feel that their

00:06:24.240 --> 00:06:24.250
ideas how many people feel that their
 

00:06:24.250 --> 00:06:26.100
ideas how many people feel that their
ideas were taken somebody else is using

00:06:26.100 --> 00:06:26.110
ideas were taken somebody else is using
 

00:06:26.110 --> 00:06:28.080

it and they don't get credit credit is

00:06:28.080 --> 00:06:28.090
it and they don't get credit credit is
 

00:06:28.090 --> 00:06:30.960
it and they don't get credit credit is
free right credit is great give

00:06:30.960 --> 00:06:30.970
free right credit is great give

everybody credit right there's a team of
 

00:06:32.620 --> 00:06:35.430
everybody credit right there's a team of
100 people give everybody credit why why

00:06:35.430 --> 00:06:35.440
100 people give everybody credit why why
 

00:06:35.440 --> 00:06:39.210
100 people give everybody credit why why
not why are we so stingy with giving

00:06:39.210 --> 00:06:39.220
not why are we so stingy with giving
 

00:06:39.220 --> 00:06:41.340
not why are we so stingy with giving
people giving people credit anyway

00:06:41.340 --> 00:06:41.350
people giving people credit anyway
 

00:06:41.350 --> 00:06:43.020
people giving people credit anyway
there's lots of other examples like this

00:06:43.020 --> 00:06:43.030
there's lots of other examples like this
 

00:06:43.030 --> 00:06:44.910
there's lots of other examples like this
we could just say let's look at all the

00:06:44.910 --> 00:06:44.920
we could just say let's look at all the
 

00:06:44.920 --> 00:06:46.710
we could just say let's look at all the
things that give people a sense of

00:06:46.710 --> 00:06:46.720
things that give people a sense of
 

00:06:46.720 --> 00:06:49.110
things that give people a sense of
meaning and let's just try to give more

00:06:49.110 --> 00:06:49.120
meaning and let's just try to give more
 

00:06:49.120 --> 00:06:55.240
meaning and let's just try to give more
of it on everyday basis
