00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.892
- Ezra enjoys gardening.

00:00:02.107 --> 00:00:04.661
Every sunflower plant he waters

00:00:04.661 --> 00:00:08.469
requires 0.7 liters of water,

00:00:08.469 --> 00:00:10.793
and every lily plant he waters

00:00:10.793 --> 00:00:13.510
requires 0.5 liters of water.

00:00:13.727 --> 00:00:18.022
Ezra has a total of 11 liters
of water for these plants.

00:00:18.313 --> 00:00:19.857
In the following inequality,

00:00:19.857 --> 00:00:22.270
S represents the number
of sunflower plants

00:00:22.270 --> 00:00:24.451
and L represents the number

00:00:24.451 --> 00:00:26.818
of lily plants Ezra can water.

00:00:27.098 --> 00:00:28.245
See if this makes sense.

00:00:28.308 --> 00:00:29.800
So it looks like...

00:00:29.852 --> 00:00:32.378
So the number of sunflower plants is S

00:00:32.627 --> 00:00:36.603
and he would have to use
7/10 of a liter per plant.

00:00:36.992 --> 00:00:39.076
So this first term right over here,

00:00:39.372 --> 00:00:40.795
this is how much water used

00:00:40.795 --> 00:00:43.318
to water the sunflower plants

00:00:43.508 --> 00:00:45.492
and then the second term is how much water

00:00:45.492 --> 00:00:47.544
used to water the lily plants

00:00:47.544 --> 00:00:51.184
cause he needs half a liter
for each of the L lily plants.

00:00:51.387 --> 00:00:53.355
And he has a total of 11 liters.

00:00:53.453 --> 00:00:54.928
So the sum right over here

00:00:54.928 --> 00:00:56.675
has to be less than or equal to 11.

00:00:56.994 --> 00:00:57.639
Alright.

00:00:57.783 --> 00:01:00.495
Ezra waters 10 lily plants.

00:01:00.686 --> 00:01:02.561
So that's L is equal to 10.

00:01:02.903 --> 00:01:05.991
How many sunflower plants
can he water at most

00:01:05.991 --> 00:01:08.342
with the remaining amount of water?

00:01:08.626 --> 00:01:10.060
Well let's think about this a little bit.

00:01:10.333 --> 00:01:12.243
We have 0.7,

00:01:13.026 --> 00:01:16.573
0.7 times the number of
sunflower plants he waters.

00:01:17.043 --> 00:01:19.255
Plus, plus...

00:01:19.655 --> 00:01:21.491
So we're gonna assume L is equal to 10.

00:01:21.491 --> 00:01:22.963
He waters 10 lily plants

00:01:22.963 --> 00:01:26.000
and each of them, he
gives half a liter to.

00:01:26.307 --> 00:01:27.602
So 0.5,

00:01:28.501 --> 00:01:32.373
0.5 x 10 is going to be 5.

00:01:32.808 --> 00:01:36.407
So it's gonna be five liters,
watering the 10 lily plants

00:01:36.407 --> 00:01:38.897
and this has to be less
than or equal to 11.

00:01:40.110 --> 00:01:44.179
So we can try to isolate
the S on the left hand side.

00:01:44.243 --> 00:01:46.530
So let's, let's do that.
The number of sunflowers.

00:01:46.530 --> 00:01:48.509
So we could first subtract
five from both sides.

00:01:49.327 --> 00:01:51.458
Subtract five from both sides.

00:01:51.707 --> 00:01:53.617
and we are going to be left with...

00:01:54.168 --> 00:01:56.920
We are going to be left
with on the left hand side,

00:01:57.800 --> 00:02:01.558
we're gonna just have 0.7 x S

00:02:02.028 --> 00:02:04.001
So this expression is
the total amount of water

00:02:04.001 --> 00:02:05.772
he's gonna spend on the sunflower plants

00:02:06.044 --> 00:02:08.286
has to be less than or equal to

00:02:08.286 --> 00:02:10.716
11- 5 is equal to six.

00:02:11.456 --> 00:02:14.931
And so now, we can
divide both sides by 0.7

00:02:15.784 --> 00:02:17.677
And we're gonna have to
change the inequality

00:02:17.677 --> 00:02:21.073
because we are diving by
a positive number, 0.7

00:02:21.484 --> 00:02:23.093
So we're gonna get S...

00:02:24.038 --> 00:02:26.777
S is less than or equal to

00:02:26.777 --> 00:02:29.588
6 รท 0.7

00:02:30.038 --> 00:02:31.648
or we could even write this as...

00:02:31.805 --> 00:02:33.808
we could write this as, well...

00:02:33.825 --> 00:02:37.395
This is 6 divided by 0.7

00:02:37.424 --> 00:02:38.730
Let me write everything as a fraction.

00:02:38.898 --> 00:02:43.455
This is the same thing as 6 รท 7/10

00:02:43.576 --> 00:02:48.576
which is equal to six times 10 over seven

00:02:48.974 --> 00:02:52.510
which is equal to 60/7

00:02:52.620 --> 00:02:55.168
which is equal to what is this?

00:02:55.174 --> 00:02:57.711
8 4/7

00:02:57.902 --> 00:03:02.273
so S has to be less than
eight and four sevenths.

00:03:02.476 --> 00:03:03.683
Now assuming that he's only,

00:03:03.683 --> 00:03:06.208
we're only thinking in
terms of whole plants...

00:03:06.214 --> 00:03:07.009
(mumbles)

00:03:07.049 --> 00:03:09.947
integer numbers but actually
whole numbers of plants

00:03:10.080 --> 00:03:13.319
and so, if S has to be less than 8 4/7,

00:03:13.319 --> 00:03:15.426
how many sunflower plants can he water

00:03:15.431 --> 00:03:17.307
at most with the
remaining amount of water?

00:03:17.602 --> 00:03:18.861
Well, we'll say that he had,

00:03:18.861 --> 00:03:20.593
most he can water eight plants.

00:03:20.833 --> 00:03:22.572
We're gonna assume that he can't water

00:03:22.572 --> 00:03:24.057
just a fraction of a plant.

00:03:24.057 --> 00:03:25.746
He either waters something or he doesn't.

00:03:25.972 --> 00:03:27.627
So he's gonna water eight,

00:03:27.795 --> 00:03:30.088
he is gonna water eight plants.

00:03:30.999 --> 00:03:32.961
Cause that's the largest whole number

00:03:32.961 --> 00:03:35.631
that is less than 8 4/7.

00:03:35.631 --> 00:03:36.316
That satisfies...

00:03:36.316 --> 00:03:39.480
That is less than or equal
to 8 4/7 I should say.
