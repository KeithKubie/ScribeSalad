&gt;&gt; Hi, YouTube. My name is Phillip Jennings.
I'm the General Secretary of, uh, UNI Global

00:00:07.390 --> 00:00:10.750
Union.
I'm here at Davos this year with the Trade

00:00:10.750 --> 00:00:15.269
Union Delegation to put
workers' issues at the forefront of the agenda.

00:00:15.269 --> 00:00:19.360
Very often, uh, the problems of working people
and the problems they

00:00:19.360 --> 00:00:23.890
have in their daily working lives is, uh,
often forgotten here IN the

00:00:23.890 --> 00:00:26.820
discussion so what we do is try to bring an
alternative VOICE to the

00:00:26.820 --> 00:00:31.910
discussions that are taking place.
The world of globalization is not working

00:00:31.910 --> 00:00:36.809
for working people.
One in two people at work are now in vulnerable

00:00:36.809 --> 00:00:41.629
employment.
The share of wages and the wealth produced

00:00:41.629 --> 00:00:45.320
is as low now since record
were kept since the Second World War.

00:00:45.320 --> 00:00:51.100
That is to say, the economic pie is actually
growing but the share of

00:00:51.100 --> 00:00:55.600
wages and earnings of workers is actually
in decline.

00:00:55.600 --> 00:00:59.390
We are faced with catastrophic inequality
in this global economy of

00:00:59.390 --> 00:01:02.780
ours.
If you look at the roots of the Subcom crisis

00:01:02.780 --> 00:01:06.350
why did it happen?
It happened because people at the low end

00:01:06.350 --> 00:01:11.060
of the income scare -- scale
could not meet their debt, could not meet

00:01:11.060 --> 00:01:16.399
their repayments and that
has spiraled into a global financial contingion.

00:01:16.399 --> 00:01:20.740
In seeking solutions I ask all the participants
here at Davos, the

00:01:20.740 --> 00:01:24.240
business people and governments, to think
of the people in the center

00:01:24.240 --> 00:01:29.859
of this storm and I think in this process
we should also recognize the

00:01:29.859 --> 00:01:33.670
role that unions play and the rights of trade
unions to organize.

00:01:33.670 --> 00:01:37.280
This year we have the 60th anniversary of
the ILO Convention on the

00:01:37.280 --> 00:01:42.710
Freedom of Association.
Never has there been so much pressure on working

00:01:42.710 --> 00:01:44.310
people to turn away
from trade unions.

00:01:44.310 --> 00:01:48.590
We see abuses of trade union rights all over
the world and if we're

00:01:48.590 --> 00:01:52.359
gonna make a dent in inequality, if we're
going to improve the working

00:01:52.359 --> 00:01:55.890
conditions of people, then we need those rights
to organize and we

00:01:55.890 --> 00:02:02.499
need -- we need to negotiate working conditions.
You defeat inequality by a fair bargain and

00:02:02.499 --> 00:02:06.359
a fair bargain has to be
done by strong social partners and a strong

00:02:06.359 --> 00:02:09.490
trade union movement and
that's why we are here to -- to bring this

00:02:09.490 --> 00:02:13.550
message.
We are here talking to business leaders and

00:02:13.550 --> 00:02:18.390
to -- to government about
dealing with these people -- uh, issues.

00:02:18.390 --> 00:02:26.319
My one hope that in -- in our work is that,
uh, the 250 million

00:02:26.319 --> 00:02:32.530
children at work should be able to go to school.
It is a global scandal that we are still facing

00:02:32.530 --> 00:02:37.430
250 million people
under the age of 14 are at work.

00:02:37.430 --> 00:02:40.299
It's also a scandal to us that many governments
are trying to attract

00:02:40.299 --> 00:02:44.350
investment around the world by eliminating
trade union rights and

00:02:44.350 --> 00:02:48.940
export processing terms.
15 million people export processing term where

00:02:48.940 --> 00:02:50.440
there's no right to
organize.

00:02:50.440 --> 00:02:54.379
So let's celebrate the 60th anniversary of
the right to organize,

00:02:54.379 --> 00:02:58.459
let's help rebuild the National Trade Union
Movement, my friends in

00:02:58.459 --> 00:03:04.000
the Global Trade Union Movement.
We are ready to innovate, we are ready to

00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:07.799
collaborate but not just to
collaborate but two negotiate for a fairer

00:03:07.799 --> 00:03:10.750
deal for working people on
this planet.

00:03:10.750 --> 00:03:15.079
It can be done.
It takes political will, and there's organizations

00:03:15.079 --> 00:03:19.680
out there like UNI,
fighting for you to improve -- uh, to improve

00:03:19.680 --> 00:03:22.930
your working conditions
and your standards of living.

00:03:22.930 --> 00:03:24.950
Thank you, YouTube.
Best of luck.

00:03:24.950 --> 00:03:25.029
Thank you.
