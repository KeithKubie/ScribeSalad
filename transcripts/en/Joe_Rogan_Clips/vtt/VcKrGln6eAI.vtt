1
00:00:00.300 --> 00:00:04.360
On Espn also just signed Tyson fury really interests.

2
00:00:04.361 --> 00:00:07.440
So now you're not getting Tyson.
Do y'all do water?
I heard about that.

3
00:00:07.441 --> 00:00:09.570
What the fuck is that about?
What?
What did,

4
00:00:09.690 --> 00:00:13.930
what did Tyson say something crazy like why would he fight him again?
Um,

5
00:00:14.250 --> 00:00:18.060
when he got robbed of a decision,
the last fight I heard that,
I was like,
oh,

6
00:00:18.210 --> 00:00:22.400
is he drinking again?
Dude,
Dude,
how about this?
How about this?
How about showtime?

7
00:00:22.410 --> 00:00:24.390
My Boys,
they had the trailer,

8
00:00:24.391 --> 00:00:27.900
they had the hype video ready to launch on Monday.

9
00:00:28.050 --> 00:00:31.710
Tyson signed with these PN Monday morning.
No one knew.

10
00:00:32.730 --> 00:00:37.080
Nobody fucking knew.
I feel bad for it.
Deontae it's heartbreak.

11
00:00:37.710 --> 00:00:41.160
Deontae Deontae almost put them out in that final round.
You know?

12
00:00:41.161 --> 00:00:45.090
And I think you can make a real argument that Tyson one,
the decision for sure,

13
00:00:45.270 --> 00:00:49.380
but when you get dropped twice and get dropped one time in the most horrific

14
00:00:49.381 --> 00:00:53.670
fashion,
I mean,
and now they say the fights not happening.

15
00:00:53.790 --> 00:00:57.050
That's crazy.
It's the biggest problem in boxing.

16
00:00:59.490 --> 00:01:02.640
So angry.
That makes me angry because there's different promoters.

17
00:01:02.641 --> 00:01:06.840
That's why the UFC jumped frog the boxing a long time.
SORTA.
But I mean,
look,

18
00:01:06.841 --> 00:01:08.250
that fight could have been made.

19
00:01:08.490 --> 00:01:11.970
Do you think that may be Tyson didn't want to fight him again?
Nope.
I think,

20
00:01:11.971 --> 00:01:15.840
I think it's his,
his handlers is his representation.
Go Dude,

21
00:01:16.320 --> 00:01:18.840
let signed with ESPN.
Get a seven figure deal.

22
00:01:18.841 --> 00:01:22.710
You can fight two bumps and then we'll circle back to wild.
Well man,

23
00:01:22.711 --> 00:01:27.480
as boxing maybe.
I mean there's argument that that's a good move financially.

24
00:01:27.720 --> 00:01:32.700
I guess it's heartbreaking.
Heartbreaking.
Right here.
Oh Dude.

25
00:01:36.770 --> 00:01:41.510
I wanted to cry.
I wanted to cry.
That's so fresh.

26
00:01:41.511 --> 00:01:45.770
But it does open up Anthony.
Joshua Deontay wilder,

27
00:01:46.430 --> 00:01:48.580
which is very sad.
But yeah,
nothing,

28
00:01:48.620 --> 00:01:52.820
no time soon cause Deontae still gonna fight in May.
Maybe dealing white,

29
00:01:52.880 --> 00:01:56.890
maybe Louis Ortiz.
Yeah.
Louis Ortiz is still fucking dangerous.
Really?

30
00:01:56.900 --> 00:02:01.400
White's a motherfucker.
So then you know,
had Anthony Joshua be great,

31
00:02:01.401 --> 00:02:04.970
but he's fighting Miller.
Yeah.
And that's a tough fight for him.

32
00:02:05.450 --> 00:02:09.140
Big Baby Miller's got some fucking power.
You don't think so?
No.

33
00:02:09.230 --> 00:02:12.170
That's a Madison Square Garden to right.
First Time Anthony.

34
00:02:12.171 --> 00:02:13.930
Joshua was fighting in the United States though.
Yup.

35
00:02:14.090 --> 00:02:17.600
When you find the United States have to out fuck Tyson fury.
Wow.

36
00:02:19.660 --> 00:02:22.480
Brazil.
That seems like a fake name.

37
00:02:23.590 --> 00:02:26.500
It's like he's a former football player.
Go Dude's name is breeze.

38
00:02:26.530 --> 00:02:27.880
You call them Brazil.

39
00:02:28.270 --> 00:02:32.790
Fuck Dominic Brazil boxing's in May.
My mandatory.

40
00:02:32.810 --> 00:02:36.820
So frustrating.
However you got Mikey Garcia.
Earl spends coming up.

41
00:02:36.821 --> 00:02:40.370
That's amazing.
We should do,
if I can pay him for that.
When is that?
March.
So.
