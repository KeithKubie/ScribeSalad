00:00:13.320 --> 00:00:18.580
Very good evening. Very, very good evening, ladies and gentlemen

00:00:18.620 --> 00:00:20.560
Very good evening to dear children

00:00:20.560 --> 00:00:23.180
In my hands, here. I am holding an object.

00:00:23.180 --> 00:00:28.040
And object which is made out of something, which is very, very common on our planet

00:00:28.800 --> 00:00:31.500
However, it is not belong to this planet

00:00:31.520 --> 00:00:35.700
You see, what's i am holding, is a piece of an iron meteorite

00:00:35.700 --> 00:00:39.960
This iron meteorite fell in Mexico ten thousand years ago

00:00:40.120 --> 00:00:43.180
It was It weighs three tons

00:00:43.260 --> 00:00:49.480
And a part of it was donated, this part was donated to the Royal Institution 1794

00:00:49.480 --> 00:00:52.220
And i am very please to be able to show you this

00:00:52.220 --> 00:01:00.780
Now, meteorites are made of iron and we are aware of the fact that people have been using iron, meteoritic iron

00:01:00.840 --> 00:01:03.920
for about at least ten thousand years

00:01:03.920 --> 00:01:05.760
That's how far our records go

00:01:05.760 --> 00:01:14.080
However, people have been using iron, which they have been making by themselves for approximately five thousand years

00:01:14.080 --> 00:01:19.840
Now, if you don't mind, i've got to get my meteorite away, because it's very, very precious indeed

00:01:19.880 --> 00:01:22.300
And i will come back to that later on

00:01:22.300 --> 00:01:28.160
Now, what i want to tell you is that: iron is something which we associate with permanence

00:01:28.160 --> 00:01:34.300
It's something which is long lasting, that meteorite is millions and millions of years old

00:01:34.300 --> 00:01:40.400
The meteorite that, that's lines that's in Mexico, that fall around thousand of meteorites,

00:01:40.420 --> 00:01:44.100
the Mesopotamians knew about meteorites they use

00:01:44.100 --> 00:01:51.580
And we know, that a people use meteoritic iron, well before, they started using iron which they made themselves

00:01:51.580 --> 00:01:55.780
Iron is associated with permanence. You go outside, what did you see?

00:01:55.780 --> 00:02:02.560
You see lamp posts, you see bridges, you see Hammersmith Bridge, beautifully made out of iron, steel

00:02:02.560 --> 00:02:06.120
You see the Eiffel Tower made out of steel, you see railings

00:02:07.940 --> 00:02:10.920
Everywhere it is associated with prominence

00:02:10.940 --> 00:02:20.260
And perhaps to tell you, that of a greatest, the most famous monument, which exists in the world today

00:02:20.520 --> 00:02:26.640
of ancient iron craft made by humans is the Iron Pillar in Delhi, there it is

00:02:26.660 --> 00:02:35.580
the Iron Pillar in Delhi, which is in North India, has been crafted by people 2300 years ago

00:02:35.580 --> 00:02:41.320
It's very, very pure sample of iron and it is a mystery, it is a mystery, which i'll talk about

00:02:41.320 --> 00:02:47.100
that this has survived for so long in view of what i am about to tell you

00:02:47.100 --> 00:02:54.280
So, iron there is associated with permanence, with long, long &lt;?&gt; and with long lasting this

00:02:54.280 --> 00:03:01.600
However, i wanted demonstrate you, in the next hour or so, that any nothing could be farther from the truth,

00:03:01.600 --> 00:03:07.000
than the permanence of iron, if it is subjected to the right sorts of conditions

00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:15.760
You see, i have here two sheets of steel. I bought this as a offcuts from a metal supply a few weeks ago

00:03:15.760 --> 00:03:19.980
and this sheet of steel as you see is nice and shiny, as they'd expected to be

00:03:19.980 --> 00:03:26.380
but this sheet of steel here has got a sort of something, which you are very familiar with use,

00:03:26.380 --> 00:03:33.980
yes, it's gone rusty, it's gone rusty, it's beginning to corrode and this is not only not looking very nice

00:03:33.980 --> 00:03:39.360
but it is actually going to fall apart over a period of time
