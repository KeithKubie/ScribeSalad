00:00:22.190 --> 00:00:23.920
PROFESSOR: What we're going
to talk about today is a

00:00:23.920 --> 00:00:26.750
continuation of last time.

00:00:26.750 --> 00:00:29.600
I want to review Newton's method
because I want to talk

00:00:29.600 --> 00:00:41.220
to you about its accuracy.

00:00:41.220 --> 00:00:46.090
So if you remember, the way
Newton's method works is this.

00:00:46.090 --> 00:00:50.150
If you have a curve and you
want to know whether it

00:00:50.150 --> 00:00:52.730
crosses the axis.

00:00:52.730 --> 00:00:55.450
And you don't know where this
point is, this point which

00:00:55.450 --> 00:01:01.250
I'll call x here, what you
do is you take a guess.

00:01:01.250 --> 00:01:03.590
Maybe you take a
point x0 here.

00:01:03.590 --> 00:01:06.830
And then you go down to this
point on the graph. and you

00:01:06.830 --> 00:01:08.930
draw the tangent line.

00:01:08.930 --> 00:01:10.880
I'll draw these in a couple of
different colors so that you

00:01:10.880 --> 00:01:13.180
can see the difference
between them.

00:01:13.180 --> 00:01:14.410
So here's a tangent line.

00:01:14.410 --> 00:01:18.280
It's coming out like that.

00:01:18.280 --> 00:01:20.750
And that one is going to
get a little closer

00:01:20.750 --> 00:01:23.090
to our target point.

00:01:23.090 --> 00:01:27.310
But now the trick is, and this
is rather hard to see because

00:01:27.310 --> 00:01:30.370
the scale gets small incredibly
fast, is that if

00:01:30.370 --> 00:01:33.140
you go right up from that,
and you do this

00:01:33.140 --> 00:01:34.420
same trick over again.

00:01:34.420 --> 00:01:38.800
That is, this is your second
guess, x1, and now you draw

00:01:38.800 --> 00:01:41.360
the second tangent line.

00:01:41.360 --> 00:01:44.680
Which is going to come
down this way.

00:01:44.680 --> 00:01:46.290
That's really close.

00:01:46.290 --> 00:01:49.800
You can see here on the
chalkboard, it's practically

00:01:49.800 --> 00:01:51.740
the same as the dot of x.

00:01:51.740 --> 00:01:54.610
So that's the next guess.

00:01:54.610 --> 00:01:56.860
Which is x2.

00:01:56.860 --> 00:02:03.620
And I want to analyze, now,
how close it gets.

00:02:03.620 --> 00:02:05.990
And just describe to
you how it works.

00:02:05.990 --> 00:02:09.060
So let me just remind you
of the formulas, too.

00:02:09.060 --> 00:02:11.150
It's worth having them
in your head.

00:02:11.150 --> 00:02:19.240
So the formula for the
next one is this.

00:02:19.240 --> 00:02:23.570
And then the idea is just
to repeat this process.

00:02:23.570 --> 00:02:29.140
Which has a fancy name, which is
in algorithms, which is to

00:02:29.140 --> 00:02:31.210
iterate, if you like.

00:02:31.210 --> 00:02:32.530
So we repeat the process.

00:02:32.530 --> 00:02:35.980
And that means, for example, we
generate x2 from x1 by the

00:02:35.980 --> 00:02:41.730
same formula.

00:02:41.730 --> 00:02:43.170
And we did this last time.

00:02:43.170 --> 00:02:47.930
And, more generally, the n + 1st
is generated from the nth

00:02:47.930 --> 00:02:55.150
guess, by this formula here.

00:02:55.150 --> 00:03:02.970
So what I'd like to do is just
draw the picture of one step a

00:03:02.970 --> 00:03:03.920
little bit more closely.

00:03:03.920 --> 00:03:05.380
So I want to blow
up the picture,

00:03:05.380 --> 00:03:10.880
which is above me there.

00:03:10.880 --> 00:03:11.950
That's a little too high.

00:03:11.950 --> 00:03:16.750
Where are my erasers?

00:03:16.750 --> 00:03:19.480
Got to get it a little lower
than that, since I'm going to

00:03:19.480 --> 00:03:21.890
depict everything above
the line here.

00:03:21.890 --> 00:03:24.180
So here's my curve
coming down.

00:03:24.180 --> 00:03:30.990
And suppose that x1 is here, so
this is directly above it

00:03:30.990 --> 00:03:32.170
is this point here.

00:03:32.170 --> 00:03:36.640
And then as I drew it,
this green tangent

00:03:36.640 --> 00:03:38.530
coming down like that.

00:03:38.530 --> 00:03:43.270
It's a little bit closer, and
this was the place, x2, and

00:03:43.270 --> 00:03:47.110
then here was x, our target,
which is where the curve

00:03:47.110 --> 00:03:48.880
crosses as opposed
to the straight

00:03:48.880 --> 00:03:52.600
tangent line crossing.

00:03:52.600 --> 00:03:56.310
So that's the picture that I
want you to keep in mind.

00:03:56.310 --> 00:04:01.160
And now, we're just going to do
a very qualitative kind of

00:04:01.160 --> 00:04:03.450
error analysis.

00:04:03.450 --> 00:04:12.960
So here's our error analysis.

00:04:12.960 --> 00:04:19.870
And we're starting out, the
distance between x1 and x is

00:04:19.870 --> 00:04:20.480
what we want to measure.

00:04:20.480 --> 00:04:23.530
In other words, how close we
are to where we're heading.

00:04:23.530 --> 00:04:26.600
And so I've called that, I'm
going to call that Error 1.

00:04:26.600 --> 00:04:28.630
That's x - x1.

00:04:28.630 --> 00:04:31.440
In absolute value.

00:04:31.440 --> 00:04:37.010
And then, E2 would be x -
x2, in absolute value.

00:04:37.010 --> 00:04:39.100
And so forth.

00:04:39.100 --> 00:04:44.190
And, last time, when I was
estimating the size of this,

00:04:44.190 --> 00:04:45.870
so En would be whatever
it was.

00:04:45.870 --> 00:04:51.900
Last time, remember, we did
it for a specific case.

00:04:51.900 --> 00:04:56.020
So last time, I actually
wrote down the numbers.

00:04:56.020 --> 00:04:59.170
And they were these numbers,
maybe you could call them En,

00:04:59.170 --> 00:05:03.270
which was the absolute value
of square root of 5 - xn.

00:05:03.270 --> 00:05:06.610
These are the sizes that I was
writing down last time.

00:05:06.610 --> 00:05:11.620
And I just want to talk about
in general what to expect.

00:05:11.620 --> 00:05:14.140
That worked amazingly well, and
I want to show you that

00:05:14.140 --> 00:05:16.990
that's true pretty
much in general.

00:05:16.990 --> 00:05:23.660
So the first distance, again, is
E1, is this distance here.

00:05:23.660 --> 00:05:25.190
That's the E1.

00:05:25.190 --> 00:05:28.040
And then this shorter distance,
here, this little

00:05:28.040 --> 00:05:37.410
bit, which I'll mark maybe
in green, is E2.

00:05:37.410 --> 00:05:40.970
So how much shorter
is E1 than E2?

00:05:40.970 --> 00:05:44.080
Well, the idea is
pretty simple.

00:05:44.080 --> 00:05:47.020
It's that if this distance in
this vertical, distances are

00:05:47.020 --> 00:05:49.520
probably about the same as the
perpendicular distance.

00:05:49.520 --> 00:05:52.820
And this is basically the
situation of a curve touching

00:05:52.820 --> 00:05:54.140
a tangent line.

00:05:54.140 --> 00:05:58.010
Then the separation is going
to be quadratic.

00:05:58.010 --> 00:06:00.150
And that's basically what's
going to happen.

00:06:00.150 --> 00:06:04.440
So, in other words the distance
E2 is going to be

00:06:04.440 --> 00:06:06.530
about the square of
the distance E1.

00:06:06.530 --> 00:06:10.770
And that's really the only
feature of this that I

00:06:10.770 --> 00:06:11.620
want to point out.

00:06:11.620 --> 00:06:14.660
So, approximately, this
is the situation that

00:06:14.660 --> 00:06:17.880
we're going to get.

00:06:17.880 --> 00:06:23.140
And so what that means is, and
maybe thinking from last time,

00:06:23.140 --> 00:06:25.760
what we had was something
roughly like this.

00:06:25.760 --> 00:06:29.335
You have an E0, you have an E1,
you have an E2, you have

00:06:29.335 --> 00:06:31.590
an E3, and so forth.

00:06:31.590 --> 00:06:34.370
Maybe I'll write down E4 here.

00:06:34.370 --> 00:06:37.330
And last time, this was
about 10 ^ - 1.

00:06:37.330 --> 00:06:40.990
So the expectation based on
this rule is that the next

00:06:40.990 --> 00:06:42.710
error's the square of
the previous one.

00:06:42.710 --> 00:06:44.500
So that's 10 ^ - 2.

00:06:44.500 --> 00:06:47.140
The next one is the square
of the previous one.

00:06:47.140 --> 00:06:49.090
So that's 10 ^ - 4.

00:06:49.090 --> 00:06:52.330
And the next one is the square
of that, that's 10 ^ - 8.

00:06:52.330 --> 00:06:55.980
And this one is 10 ^ - 16.

00:06:55.980 --> 00:06:59.640
So the thing that's impressive
about this list of numbers is

00:06:59.640 --> 00:07:03.630
you can see that the number of
digits of accuracy doubles at

00:07:03.630 --> 00:07:09.590
each stage.

00:07:09.590 --> 00:07:20.760
Accuracy doubles at each step.

00:07:20.760 --> 00:07:23.710
The number of digits of accuracy
doubles at each step.

00:07:23.710 --> 00:07:28.390
So, very, very quickly you get
past the accuracy of your

00:07:28.390 --> 00:07:31.150
calculator, as you saw
on your problem set.

00:07:31.150 --> 00:07:34.220
And this thing works
beautifully.

00:07:34.220 --> 00:07:42.700
So, let me just summarize by
saying that Newton's method

00:07:42.700 --> 00:07:49.680
works very well.

00:07:49.680 --> 00:07:52.250
By which I mean this
kind of rate.

00:07:52.250 --> 00:07:55.450
And I want to be just
slightly specific.

00:07:55.450 --> 00:08:00.490
If, there's really two
conditions disguised in this,

00:08:00.490 --> 00:08:01.480
that are going on.

00:08:01.480 --> 00:08:04.800
One is that f' has
to be, not to be.

00:08:04.800 --> 00:08:09.890
To be not small.

00:08:09.890 --> 00:08:19.730
And f'' has to be not too big.

00:08:19.730 --> 00:08:21.960
That's roughly speaking what's
going on. i'll explain these

00:08:21.960 --> 00:08:23.320
in just a second.

00:08:23.320 --> 00:08:34.050
And x0 starts nearby.

00:08:34.050 --> 00:08:37.490
Nearby the target value x.

00:08:37.490 --> 00:08:42.050
So that's really what's
going on here.

00:08:42.050 --> 00:08:44.610
So let me just illustrate
to you.

00:08:44.610 --> 00:08:48.920
So I'm not going to explain
this, except to say the reason

00:08:48.920 --> 00:08:52.010
why this second derivative gets
involved is that it's how

00:08:52.010 --> 00:08:55.330
curved the curve is, that
how far away you get.

00:08:55.330 --> 00:08:58.260
If the second derivative were
0, that would be the best

00:08:58.260 --> 00:08:58.840
possible case.

00:08:58.840 --> 00:09:00.660
Then we would get
it on the nose.

00:09:00.660 --> 00:09:03.160
If the second derivative is not
too big, that means the

00:09:03.160 --> 00:09:05.360
quadratic part is not too big.

00:09:05.360 --> 00:09:08.030
So we don't get away very far
from the green line to the

00:09:08.030 --> 00:09:14.110
curve itself.

00:09:14.110 --> 00:09:17.910
The other thing to say is,
as I said, that x0

00:09:17.910 --> 00:09:19.050
needs to start nearby.

00:09:19.050 --> 00:09:21.970
So I'll explain that
by explaining what

00:09:21.970 --> 00:09:23.310
maybe could go wrong.

00:09:23.310 --> 00:09:39.720
So the ways the method can fail,
and one example which

00:09:39.720 --> 00:09:45.080
actually would have happened in
our example from last time,

00:09:45.080 --> 00:09:50.390
which was y = x^2 -
5, is suppose we'd

00:09:50.390 --> 00:09:54.840
started x0 over here.

00:09:54.840 --> 00:09:57.680
Then this thing would have gone
off to the left, and we

00:09:57.680 --> 00:10:00.980
would have landed on not
the square root of 5

00:10:00.980 --> 00:10:03.030
but the other root.

00:10:03.030 --> 00:10:11.750
So if it's too far away, then
we get the wrong root.

00:10:11.750 --> 00:10:15.590
So that's an example, explaining
that the x0 needs

00:10:15.590 --> 00:10:18.710
to start near the root that
we're talking about.

00:10:18.710 --> 00:10:22.060
Otherwise, the method doesn't
know which root

00:10:22.060 --> 00:10:22.940
you're asking for.

00:10:22.940 --> 00:10:24.580
It only knows where
you started.

00:10:24.580 --> 00:10:27.310
So it may go off to
the wrong place.

00:10:27.310 --> 00:10:34.430
OK, it can't read your mind.

00:10:34.430 --> 00:10:35.350
Yes, question.

00:10:35.350 --> 00:10:42.610
STUDENT: [INAUDIBLE]

00:10:42.610 --> 00:10:44.460
PROFESSOR: Oh, good question.

00:10:44.460 --> 00:10:48.550
So the question was, what
if the first error

00:10:48.550 --> 00:10:49.550
is larger than 1.

00:10:49.550 --> 00:10:51.220
Are you in trouble?

00:10:51.220 --> 00:10:56.000
And the answer is,
absolutely, yes.

00:10:56.000 --> 00:10:58.110
If you have quadratic behavior,
you can see.

00:10:58.110 --> 00:11:01.450
If you have a quadratic nearby,
it's pretty close to

00:11:01.450 --> 00:11:02.820
the straight line.

00:11:02.820 --> 00:11:05.900
But far away, a parabola is
miles from a straight line.

00:11:05.900 --> 00:11:08.180
It's way, way, way far away.

00:11:08.180 --> 00:11:14.560
So if you're foolish enough to
start over here, you may have

00:11:14.560 --> 00:11:17.150
some trouble making progress.

00:11:17.150 --> 00:11:20.790
Actually, it isn't - when I,
that little wiggle there just

00:11:20.790 --> 00:11:22.010
meant proportional to.

00:11:22.010 --> 00:11:25.270
In fact, in the particular case
of a parabola, it manages

00:11:25.270 --> 00:11:25.810
to get back.

00:11:25.810 --> 00:11:27.150
It saves itself.

00:11:27.150 --> 00:11:30.010
But there's no guarantee
of that sort of thing.

00:11:30.010 --> 00:11:32.790
You really do want to start
reasonably close.

00:11:32.790 --> 00:11:33.350
Yep.

00:11:33.350 --> 00:11:40.140
STUDENT: [INAUDIBLE]

00:11:40.140 --> 00:11:42.580
PROFESSOR: What you have to do
is you have to watch out.

00:11:42.580 --> 00:11:45.630
That is, it's hard to know
what assumptions

00:11:45.630 --> 00:11:46.790
to make about x0.

00:11:46.790 --> 00:11:50.250
You plug it into the machine
and you see what you get.

00:11:50.250 --> 00:11:53.330
And either it works
or it doesn't.

00:11:53.330 --> 00:11:55.310
You can tell that it's marching
toward a specific

00:11:55.310 --> 00:11:56.510
place, and you can tell
that that place

00:11:56.510 --> 00:11:58.400
probably is a 0, usually.

00:11:58.400 --> 00:12:00.510
But maybe it's not the one
you were looking for.

00:12:00.510 --> 00:12:01.870
So in other words, you have
to use your head.

00:12:01.870 --> 00:12:05.230
You run the program and then
you see what it does.

00:12:05.230 --> 00:12:07.630
And if you're lucky - the
problem is, if you have no

00:12:07.630 --> 00:12:12.270
idea where the 0 is, you may
just wander around forever.

00:12:12.270 --> 00:12:14.720
As we'll see in a second.

00:12:14.720 --> 00:12:20.870
So the next example here
is the following.

00:12:20.870 --> 00:12:24.590
I said that f' has to
be not too small.

00:12:24.590 --> 00:12:26.710
There's a real catastrophe
hiding

00:12:26.710 --> 00:12:28.250
just inside this picture.

00:12:28.250 --> 00:12:30.350
Which is the transition between
when you find the

00:12:30.350 --> 00:12:32.890
positive root and when you find
the negative root here.

00:12:32.890 --> 00:12:35.480
Which is, if you're
right down here.

00:12:35.480 --> 00:12:38.490
If you were foolish enough to
get 0, then what's going to

00:12:38.490 --> 00:12:41.940
happen is your tangent
line is horizontal.

00:12:41.940 --> 00:12:44.610
It doesn't even meet the axis.

00:12:44.610 --> 00:12:47.840
So in the formula, you can
see that's a catastrophe.

00:12:47.840 --> 00:12:53.030
Because there's an f'
in the denominator.

00:12:53.030 --> 00:12:53.530
So that's 0.

00:12:53.530 --> 00:12:55.000
That's undefined.

00:12:55.000 --> 00:12:57.860
It's not surprising, it's
consistent that the parallel

00:12:57.860 --> 00:12:59.480
line doesn't meet the axis.

00:12:59.480 --> 00:13:01.940
And you have no x1.

00:13:01.940 --> 00:13:09.720
So you had, so if you like,
another point here is that f'

00:13:09.720 --> 00:13:12.870
= 0 is a disaster.

00:13:12.870 --> 00:13:24.310
A disaster for the method.

00:13:24.310 --> 00:13:28.220
Because the next, so
say, if f (x0) =

00:13:28.220 --> 00:13:34.700
0, then x1 is undefined.

00:13:34.700 --> 00:13:39.170
And finally, there's one other
weird thing that can happen.

00:13:39.170 --> 00:13:43.460
Which is, which I'll just draw
a picture of schematically.

00:13:43.460 --> 00:13:47.150
Which you can get
from a wiggle.

00:13:47.150 --> 00:13:49.260
So this wiggle has
three roots.

00:13:49.260 --> 00:13:52.060
The way I've drawn it.

00:13:52.060 --> 00:13:56.720
And it can be that you can start
over here with your x0.

00:13:56.720 --> 00:14:01.200
And draw your tangent line and
go over here to an x1.

00:14:01.200 --> 00:14:02.760
And then that tangent
line will take you

00:14:02.760 --> 00:14:05.510
right back to the x0.

00:14:05.510 --> 00:14:09.560
I didn't draw it quite right,
but that's about right.

00:14:09.560 --> 00:14:11.330
So it goes over like this.

00:14:11.330 --> 00:14:13.610
So let me draw the two tangent
lines, so that

00:14:13.610 --> 00:14:14.760
you can see it properly.

00:14:14.760 --> 00:14:16.660
Sorry, I messed it up.

00:14:16.660 --> 00:14:18.030
So here are the two
tangent lines.

00:14:18.030 --> 00:14:20.870
This guy and this guy.

00:14:20.870 --> 00:14:26.410
And it just goes back and forth.
x0 cycles to x1, and x1

00:14:26.410 --> 00:14:27.520
goes back to x0.

00:14:27.520 --> 00:14:30.200
We have a cycle.

00:14:30.200 --> 00:14:32.090
And it never goes anywhere.

00:14:32.090 --> 00:14:35.080
This is, the grass is
always greener.

00:14:35.080 --> 00:14:37.250
It's over here, it thinks, oh, I
really would prefer to go to

00:14:37.250 --> 00:14:40.840
this 0 and then it thinks
oh, I want to go back.

00:14:40.840 --> 00:14:43.650
And it goes back and forth,
and back and forth.

00:14:43.650 --> 00:14:47.060
Grass is always greener on the
other side of the fence.

00:14:47.060 --> 00:14:50.090
Never, never gets anywhere.

00:14:50.090 --> 00:14:52.650
So those are the sorts of things
that can go wrong with

00:14:52.650 --> 00:14:53.490
Newton's method.

00:14:53.490 --> 00:14:55.210
Nevertheless, it's fantastic.

00:14:55.210 --> 00:14:59.740
It works very well, in
a lot of situations.

00:14:59.740 --> 00:15:03.510
And solves basically any
equation that you can imagine,

00:15:03.510 --> 00:15:11.050
numerically.

00:15:11.050 --> 00:15:12.060
Next we're going to move on.

00:15:12.060 --> 00:15:13.550
We're going to move on to
something which is a little

00:15:13.550 --> 00:15:15.730
theoretical.

00:15:15.730 --> 00:15:18.170
Which is the mean
value theorem.

00:15:18.170 --> 00:15:24.710
And that will allow us in just a
day or so to launch into the

00:15:24.710 --> 00:15:27.210
ideas of integration,
which is the whole

00:15:27.210 --> 00:15:31.140
second half of the course.

00:15:31.140 --> 00:15:50.200
So let's get started
with that.

00:15:50.200 --> 00:15:57.030
The mean value theorem will
henceforth be abbreviated MVT.

00:15:57.030 --> 00:15:59.480
So I don't have to write
quite as much every

00:15:59.480 --> 00:16:03.750
time I refer to it.

00:16:03.750 --> 00:16:05.980
The mean values theorem,

00:16:05.980 --> 00:16:09.530
colloquially, says the following.

00:16:09.530 --> 00:16:23.040
If you go from Boston to LA,
which I think a lot of Red Sox

00:16:23.040 --> 00:16:31.110
fans are going to want to do
soon, so that's 3,000 miles.

00:16:31.110 --> 00:16:51.380
In 6 hours, then at some
time you are going

00:16:51.380 --> 00:16:55.640
at a certain speed.

00:16:55.640 --> 00:17:01.360
The average of this speed.

00:17:01.360 --> 00:17:08.850
Average, so speed, which
in this case is what?

00:17:08.850 --> 00:17:10.770
So we're going at the
average speed.

00:17:10.770 --> 00:17:17.560
That's 3,000 miles times
6 hours, so that's

00:17:17.560 --> 00:17:21.420
500 miles per hour.

00:17:21.420 --> 00:17:23.340
Exactly.

00:17:23.340 --> 00:17:26.660
So sometime on your journey,
of course, some of the time

00:17:26.660 --> 00:17:28.590
you're going more than 500 miles
an hour, sometimes you

00:17:28.590 --> 00:17:29.610
are going less.

00:17:29.610 --> 00:17:32.670
And some time you must've
been going 500

00:17:32.670 --> 00:17:35.110
miles an hour exactly.

00:17:35.110 --> 00:17:37.520
That's the mean value theorem.

00:17:37.520 --> 00:17:40.300
The reason why it's called mean
value theorem is that

00:17:40.300 --> 00:17:55.440
word mean is the same
as the word average.

00:17:55.440 --> 00:17:57.930
So now I'm going to
state it in math

00:17:57.930 --> 00:18:08.160
symbols, the same theorem.

00:18:08.160 --> 00:18:10.470
And it's a formula.

00:18:10.470 --> 00:18:19.690
It says that the difference
quotient, so this is the

00:18:19.690 --> 00:18:23.230
distance traveled divided
by the time elapsed.

00:18:23.230 --> 00:18:28.370
That's the average speed, is
equal to the infinitesimal

00:18:28.370 --> 00:18:35.320
speed for some time
in between.

00:18:35.320 --> 00:18:46.120
So some c, which is in
between a and b.

00:18:46.120 --> 00:18:48.590
I'm not quite done.

00:18:48.590 --> 00:18:53.130
It's a real theorem,
it has hypotheses.

00:18:53.130 --> 00:18:57.300
I've told you the conclusion
first, but there are some

00:18:57.300 --> 00:18:59.650
hypotheses, they're
straightforward hypotheses.

00:18:59.650 --> 00:19:09.310
Provided f is differentiable;
that is, it has a derivative

00:19:09.310 --> 00:19:12.820
in the interval a &lt; x &lt; b.

00:19:12.820 --> 00:19:29.110
And continuous in a &lt; or =
x, less than or equal to.

00:19:29.110 --> 00:19:32.080
There has to be a sense that you
can make out of the speed,

00:19:32.080 --> 00:19:36.140
or the rate of change of f at
each intermediate point.

00:19:36.140 --> 00:19:40.600
And in order for the values at
the ends to make sense, it has

00:19:40.600 --> 00:19:41.200
to be continuous.

00:19:41.200 --> 00:19:46.080
There has to be a link between
the values at the ends and

00:19:46.080 --> 00:19:47.480
what's going on in between.

00:19:47.480 --> 00:19:50.280
If it were discontinuous, there
would be no relation

00:19:50.280 --> 00:19:52.450
between the left and
right values and

00:19:52.450 --> 00:19:55.970
the rest of the function.

00:19:55.970 --> 00:20:00.160
So here's the theorem,
conclusion and its hypothesis.

00:20:00.160 --> 00:20:11.780
And it means what I said more
colloquially up above.

00:20:11.780 --> 00:20:14.540
Now, I'm going to prove this
theorem immediately.

00:20:14.540 --> 00:20:18.370
At least, give a geometric
intuitive argument, which is

00:20:18.370 --> 00:20:22.070
not very different from the
one that's given in a very

00:20:22.070 --> 00:20:26.410
systematic treatment.

00:20:26.410 --> 00:20:34.280
So here's the proof of the
mean value theorem.

00:20:34.280 --> 00:20:36.860
It's really just a picture.

00:20:36.860 --> 00:20:42.880
So here's a place, and here's
another place on the graph.

00:20:42.880 --> 00:20:47.180
And the graph is going along
like this, let's say.

00:20:47.180 --> 00:20:50.700
And this line here is
the secant line.

00:20:50.700 --> 00:20:55.310
So this is (a, f (
a )) down here.

00:20:55.310 --> 00:20:59.320
And this is (b, f
( b )) up there.

00:20:59.320 --> 00:21:03.530
And this segment is the secant,
its slope is the slope

00:21:03.530 --> 00:21:04.480
that we're aiming for.

00:21:04.480 --> 00:21:08.420
The slope of that line is
the left-hand side of

00:21:08.420 --> 00:21:11.190
this formula here.

00:21:11.190 --> 00:21:14.160
So we need to find something
with that slope.

00:21:14.160 --> 00:21:16.520
And what we need to find is a
tangent line with that slope,

00:21:16.520 --> 00:21:18.900
because what's on the right-hand
side is the slip of

00:21:18.900 --> 00:21:20.220
a tangent line.

00:21:20.220 --> 00:21:22.340
So here's how we construct it.

00:21:22.340 --> 00:21:27.240
We take a parallel
line, down here.

00:21:27.240 --> 00:21:31.470
And then we just translate it
up, leaving it parallel, we

00:21:31.470 --> 00:21:32.750
move it up.

00:21:32.750 --> 00:21:34.080
Towards this one.

00:21:34.080 --> 00:21:38.410
Until it touches.

00:21:38.410 --> 00:21:43.040
And where it touches, at this
point of tangency, down there,

00:21:43.040 --> 00:21:47.490
I've just found my value of c.

00:21:47.490 --> 00:21:49.940
And you can see that if the
tangent line is parallel to

00:21:49.940 --> 00:21:53.180
this line, that's exactly
the equation we want.

00:21:53.180 --> 00:21:59.910
So this thing has
slope f' (c).

00:21:59.910 --> 00:22:07.150
And this other one has slope
equal to this complicated

00:22:07.150 --> 00:22:15.970
expression, f ( b) -
f (a) / (b - a).

00:22:15.970 --> 00:22:19.840
That is almost the
end of the proof.

00:22:19.840 --> 00:22:25.330
There's one problem.

00:22:25.330 --> 00:22:29.880
So, again, we move a
parallel line up.

00:22:29.880 --> 00:22:43.310
Move up the parallel line
until it touches.

00:22:43.310 --> 00:22:44.920
There's a little subtlety
here, which I

00:22:44.920 --> 00:22:46.300
just want to emphasize.

00:22:46.300 --> 00:22:49.210
Which is that that dotted line
keeps on going here.

00:22:49.210 --> 00:22:52.050
But when we bring it up, we're
going to ignore what's

00:22:52.050 --> 00:22:54.500
happening outside of a.

00:22:54.500 --> 00:22:56.870
And beyond b, alright?

00:22:56.870 --> 00:23:01.590
So we're just going to ignore
the rest of the graph.

00:23:01.590 --> 00:23:06.090
But there is one thing
that can go wrong.

00:23:06.090 --> 00:23:16.800
So if it does not touch, then
the picture looks likes this.

00:23:16.800 --> 00:23:18.230
Here are the same two points.

00:23:18.230 --> 00:23:20.240
And the graph is all above.

00:23:20.240 --> 00:23:22.060
And we brought up our thing.

00:23:22.060 --> 00:23:23.960
And it went like that.

00:23:23.960 --> 00:23:27.480
So we didn't construct
a tangent line.

00:23:27.480 --> 00:23:29.520
If this happens.

00:23:29.520 --> 00:23:31.980
So we're in trouble,
in that point.

00:23:31.980 --> 00:23:37.010
In this situation, sorry.

00:23:37.010 --> 00:23:40.860
But there's a trick, which is
a straightforward trick.

00:23:40.860 --> 00:23:55.810
Then bring the tangent lines
down from the top.

00:23:55.810 --> 00:23:58.040
So parallel lines, sorry,
not tangent lines.

00:23:58.040 --> 00:24:06.580
Parallel lines.

00:24:06.580 --> 00:24:11.600
From above.

00:24:11.600 --> 00:24:16.380
So, that's the whole story.

00:24:16.380 --> 00:24:22.620
That's how we cook up this
point c, with the right

00:24:22.620 --> 00:24:43.460
properties.

00:24:43.460 --> 00:24:46.640
I want to point out just one
more theoretical thing.

00:24:46.640 --> 00:24:50.150
And then the rest, we're going
to be drawing conclusions.

00:24:50.150 --> 00:24:52.060
So there's one more theoretical
remark about the

00:24:52.060 --> 00:24:57.140
proof, which is something that
is fairly important to

00:24:57.140 --> 00:24:59.130
understand.

00:24:59.130 --> 00:25:02.120
When you understand a proof, you
should always be thinking

00:25:02.120 --> 00:25:06.170
about why the hypotheses
are necessary.

00:25:06.170 --> 00:25:08.280
Where do I use the hypothesis.

00:25:08.280 --> 00:25:10.560
And I want to give you an
example where the proof

00:25:10.560 --> 00:25:13.840
doesn't work to show you
that the hypothesis is

00:25:13.840 --> 00:25:15.350
an important one.

00:25:15.350 --> 00:25:17.230
So the example is
the following.

00:25:17.230 --> 00:25:20.590
I'll just take a function
which is two

00:25:20.590 --> 00:25:22.400
straight lines like this.

00:25:22.400 --> 00:25:28.040
And if you try to perform this
trick with these things, then

00:25:28.040 --> 00:25:32.380
it's going to come up and it's
going to touch here.

00:25:32.380 --> 00:25:35.620
But the problem is that
the tangent line

00:25:35.620 --> 00:25:36.740
is not defined here.

00:25:36.740 --> 00:25:39.510
There are lots of tangents, and
there's no derivative at

00:25:39.510 --> 00:25:40.610
this point.

00:25:40.610 --> 00:25:44.860
So the derivative doesn't
exist here.

00:25:44.860 --> 00:25:57.230
So this is the claim that one
bad point ruins the proof.

00:25:57.230 --> 00:26:07.680
We need f' to exist at
all so, f' ( x ) to

00:26:07.680 --> 00:26:14.340
exist at all x in between.

00:26:14.340 --> 00:26:30.980
Can't get away even with
one defective point.

00:26:30.980 --> 00:26:40.620
Now it's time to draw
some consequences.

00:26:40.620 --> 00:26:48.420
And the main consequence is
going to have to do with

00:26:48.420 --> 00:26:57.880
applications to graphing.

00:26:57.880 --> 00:27:01.220
But we'll see tomorrow and for
the rest of the course that

00:27:01.220 --> 00:27:03.920
this is even more
significance.

00:27:03.920 --> 00:27:09.790
It's significant to all
the rest of Calculus.

00:27:09.790 --> 00:27:12.440
I'm going to list three
consequences which you're

00:27:12.440 --> 00:27:14.890
quite familiar with already.

00:27:14.890 --> 00:27:21.960
So, the first one is if f'
is positive, then f is

00:27:21.960 --> 00:27:27.550
increasing.

00:27:27.550 --> 00:27:35.780
And the second one is if f'
is negative, then f is

00:27:35.780 --> 00:27:40.430
decreasing.

00:27:40.430 --> 00:27:44.960
And the last one seems like the
simplest. But even this

00:27:44.960 --> 00:27:48.460
one alone is the key
to everything.

00:27:48.460 --> 00:28:03.340
If f' = 0, then f is constant.

00:28:03.340 --> 00:28:07.500
These are three consequences,
now, of

00:28:07.500 --> 00:28:13.490
the mean value theorem.

00:28:13.490 --> 00:28:17.130
And let me show you how
they're proved.

00:28:17.130 --> 00:28:22.870
I just told you that they were
true, maybe a while ago.

00:28:22.870 --> 00:28:27.030
And certainly I mentioned
the first two.

00:28:27.030 --> 00:28:30.200
The last one was so simple that
we maybe just swept it

00:28:30.200 --> 00:28:30.810
under the rug.

00:28:30.810 --> 00:28:36.570
You did use it on a problem
set, once or twice.

00:28:36.570 --> 00:28:39.240
But it turns out that this
actually requires proof, and

00:28:39.240 --> 00:28:48.010
we're going to give the
proof right now.

00:28:48.010 --> 00:28:52.340
The way that the proof goes is
simply to write down, to

00:28:52.340 --> 00:28:54.500
rewrite star.

00:28:54.500 --> 00:28:59.440
Rewrite our formula.

00:28:59.440 --> 00:29:10.050
Which says that f (b) - f
(a) / (b - a) = f' (c).

00:29:10.050 --> 00:29:14.180
And you see I've written it from
left to right here to say

00:29:14.180 --> 00:29:16.470
that the right-hand side
information about the

00:29:16.470 --> 00:29:18.710
derivative is going to be giving
the information about

00:29:18.710 --> 00:29:19.340
the function.

00:29:19.340 --> 00:29:22.230
That's the way I'm
going to read it.

00:29:22.230 --> 00:29:27.720
In order to express this,
though, I'm going to just

00:29:27.720 --> 00:29:30.760
rewrite it a couple
of times here.

00:29:30.760 --> 00:29:37.360
So here's f ( a ), multiplying
through by the denominator.

00:29:37.360 --> 00:29:40.630
And now I'm going to write it in
another customary form for

00:29:40.630 --> 00:29:42.300
the mean value theorem.

00:29:42.300 --> 00:29:51.300
Which is f ( b ) = f ( a
) + f' (c) ( b - a).

00:29:51.300 --> 00:29:53.600
So here's another version.

00:29:53.600 --> 00:29:55.770
I should probably have put this
one in the box to begin

00:29:55.770 --> 00:29:59.870
with anyway.

00:29:59.870 --> 00:30:03.800
And, just changing it around
algebraically,

00:30:03.800 --> 00:30:07.160
it's this fact here.

00:30:07.160 --> 00:30:13.310
They're the same thing.

00:30:13.310 --> 00:30:18.500
And now with the formula written
in this form, I claim

00:30:18.500 --> 00:30:24.060
that I can check these
three facts.

00:30:24.060 --> 00:30:26.680
Let's start with
the first one.

00:30:26.680 --> 00:30:33.580
I'm going to set things up
always so that a &lt; b.

00:30:33.580 --> 00:30:36.840
And that's the setup
of the theorem.

00:30:36.840 --> 00:30:42.010
And so that means that
b - a is positive.

00:30:42.010 --> 00:30:43.790
Which means that this
factor over here

00:30:43.790 --> 00:30:48.190
is a positive number.

00:30:48.190 --> 00:30:56.480
If f' is positive, which is
what happens in the first

00:30:56.480 --> 00:30:59.630
case, that's the assumption that
we're making, then this

00:30:59.630 --> 00:31:01.210
is a positive number.

00:31:01.210 --> 00:31:08.690
And so f( b ) &gt; f( a ).

00:31:08.690 --> 00:31:09.565
Which means that it's
increasing.

00:31:09.565 --> 00:31:13.900
It goes up as the
value goes up.

00:31:13.900 --> 00:31:20.010
Similarly, if f' (c) is
negative, then this is a

00:31:20.010 --> 00:31:22.830
positive times a negative
number, this is negative. f (

00:31:22.830 --> 00:31:25.610
b ) &lt; f(a).

00:31:25.610 --> 00:31:37.850
So it goes the other way.

00:31:37.850 --> 00:31:39.520
Maybe I'll write this way.

00:31:39.520 --> 00:31:49.910
And finally, if f' (c) =
0, then f ( b ) = f(a).

00:31:49.910 --> 00:31:53.560
Which if you apply it to all
possible ends means if you can

00:31:53.560 --> 00:31:56.610
do it for every interval, which
you can't, then that

00:31:56.610 --> 00:31:57.940
means that f is constant.

00:31:57.940 --> 00:32:12.640
It never gets to
change values.

00:32:12.640 --> 00:32:17.260
Well you might have believed
these facts already.

00:32:17.260 --> 00:32:20.790
But I just want to emphasize to
you that this turns out to

00:32:20.790 --> 00:32:25.310
be the one key link between
infinitesimals, between limits

00:32:25.310 --> 00:32:27.610
and these actual differences.

00:32:27.610 --> 00:32:30.400
Before, we were saying that the
difference quotient was

00:32:30.400 --> 00:32:32.530
approximately equal
to the derivative.

00:32:32.530 --> 00:32:35.520
Now we're saying that it's
exactly equal to a derivative.

00:32:35.520 --> 00:32:38.930
Although we don't know exactly
which point to use.

00:32:38.930 --> 00:32:47.150
It's some point in between.

00:32:47.150 --> 00:32:49.560
I'm going to be deducing some
other consequences in a

00:32:49.560 --> 00:32:52.560
second, but let me stop for
second to make sure that

00:32:52.560 --> 00:32:53.270
everybody's on board.

00:32:53.270 --> 00:32:56.880
Especially since I've finished
the blackboards here.

00:32:56.880 --> 00:32:59.510
Before we, everybody happy?

00:32:59.510 --> 00:33:00.100
One question.

00:33:00.100 --> 00:33:09.660
STUDENT: [INAUDIBLE]

00:33:09.660 --> 00:33:10.950
PROFESSOR: I'm just going to
repeat your question first.

00:33:10.950 --> 00:33:14.350
I'm a little bit confused, you
said, about what guarantees

00:33:14.350 --> 00:33:16.230
that there's a point
of tangency.

00:33:16.230 --> 00:33:19.030
That's what you said.

00:33:19.030 --> 00:33:21.530
So do you want to elaborate, or
do you want to want to stop

00:33:21.530 --> 00:33:23.240
with what you just send?

00:33:23.240 --> 00:33:24.360
What is it that confuses you?

00:33:24.360 --> 00:33:29.010
STUDENT: [INAUDIBLE]

00:33:29.010 --> 00:33:29.430
PROFESSOR: Yeah.

00:33:29.430 --> 00:33:43.500
STUDENT: [INAUDIBLE]

00:33:43.500 --> 00:33:46.530
PROFESSOR: So I'm not claiming
that there's only one point.

00:33:46.530 --> 00:33:48.610
This could wiggle a lot of times
and it maybe touches at

00:33:48.610 --> 00:33:49.990
ten places.

00:33:49.990 --> 00:33:52.870
In other words, it's
OK with me if it

00:33:52.870 --> 00:33:54.640
touches more than once.

00:33:54.640 --> 00:33:56.830
Then I just have more,
the more the merrier.

00:33:56.830 --> 00:33:58.710
In other words, I
don't want there

00:33:58.710 --> 00:34:00.050
necessarily only to be one.

00:34:00.050 --> 00:34:02.720
It could come down like this.

00:34:02.720 --> 00:34:05.140
And touch a second time.

00:34:05.140 --> 00:34:09.290
Is that what was
concerning you?

00:34:09.290 --> 00:34:12.010
So in mathematics, when we claim
that this is true for

00:34:12.010 --> 00:34:14.790
some point, we don't necessarily
mean that it

00:34:14.790 --> 00:34:16.210
doesn't work for others.

00:34:16.210 --> 00:34:19.420
In fact, if the function is
constant, this is 0 and in

00:34:19.420 --> 00:34:25.960
fact this equation is
true for every c.

00:34:25.960 --> 00:34:30.840
That satisfies your question?

00:34:30.840 --> 00:34:32.160
The fact that this point exists

00:34:32.160 --> 00:34:33.620
actually is a touchy point.

00:34:33.620 --> 00:34:35.320
I just convinced you
of it visually.

00:34:35.320 --> 00:34:37.610
It's a geometric issue,
whether you're

00:34:37.610 --> 00:34:39.030
allowed to do this.

00:34:39.030 --> 00:34:42.730
Indeed, it has to do with the
existence of tangent lines and

00:34:42.730 --> 00:34:46.250
more analysis then we can
do in this class.

00:34:46.250 --> 00:34:46.620
Yeah.

00:34:46.620 --> 00:34:47.260
Another question.

00:34:47.260 --> 00:34:48.880
STUDENT: [INAUDIBLE]

00:34:48.880 --> 00:34:51.050
PROFESSOR: Pardon me.

00:34:51.050 --> 00:34:51.270
STUDENT: [INAUDIBLE]

00:34:51.270 --> 00:34:53.570
PROFESSOR: The question is,
what's the difference between

00:34:53.570 --> 00:34:56.780
this and the linear
approximation.

00:34:56.780 --> 00:35:11.010
And I think, let me see if
I can describe that.

00:35:11.010 --> 00:35:12.520
I'll leave the theorem
on the board.

00:35:12.520 --> 00:35:14.100
I'm going to get rid
of the colloquial

00:35:14.100 --> 00:35:19.380
version of the theorem.

00:35:19.380 --> 00:35:25.430
And I'll try to describe to
you the difference between

00:35:25.430 --> 00:35:32.130
this and the linear
approximation.

00:35:32.130 --> 00:35:35.600
I was planning to do that in a
while, but we'll do it right

00:35:35.600 --> 00:35:36.890
now since that's what
you're asking.

00:35:36.890 --> 00:35:37.660
That's fine.

00:35:37.660 --> 00:35:45.570
So here's the situation.

00:35:45.570 --> 00:35:52.540
The linear approximation, so
let's say comparison with

00:35:52.540 --> 00:35:57.390
linear approximation.

00:35:57.390 --> 00:35:59.710
They're very closely related.

00:35:59.710 --> 00:36:02.300
The linear approximation says
the change in f over the

00:36:02.300 --> 00:36:06.290
change in x, that's the
left-hand side of this thing,

00:36:06.290 --> 00:36:09.980
is approximately f' (a).

00:36:09.980 --> 00:36:21.200
For b near a, and
b - a = delta x.

00:36:21.200 --> 00:36:23.470
This statement, which is in
the box, which is sitting

00:36:23.470 --> 00:36:28.110
right up there, is the statement
that this change in

00:36:28.110 --> 00:36:31.330
f is actually equal
to something.

00:36:31.330 --> 00:36:33.180
Not approximately equal to it.

00:36:33.180 --> 00:36:37.670
It's equal to f' of some c.

00:36:37.670 --> 00:36:41.330
And the problem here is that we
don't know exactly which c.

00:36:41.330 --> 00:36:43.930
This is for some c.

00:36:43.930 --> 00:36:53.190
Between a and b.

00:36:53.190 --> 00:36:54.810
Right, so.

00:36:54.810 --> 00:36:59.190
That's the difference
between the two.

00:36:59.190 --> 00:37:19.700
And let me elaborate
a little bit.

00:37:19.700 --> 00:37:27.050
If you're trying to understand
what f ( b ) - f ( a ) / (b -

00:37:27.050 --> 00:37:32.840
a) is, the mean value theorem
is telling you for sure that

00:37:32.840 --> 00:37:35.530
it's equal to this f' (c).

00:37:35.530 --> 00:37:38.230
So that means it's less than
or equal to the largest

00:37:38.230 --> 00:37:44.280
possible value on the largest
value you can get, for sure.

00:37:44.280 --> 00:37:48.110
And this is on the
whole interval.

00:37:48.110 --> 00:37:50.690
And I'm going to include the
ends, because when you take a

00:37:50.690 --> 00:37:54.050
max it's sometimes achieved
at the ends.

00:37:54.050 --> 00:37:58.770
And similarly, because it's f'
(c), it's definitely bigger

00:37:58.770 --> 00:38:07.030
than the min on this
same interval here.

00:38:07.030 --> 00:38:13.420
This is all you can say based
on the mean value theorem.

00:38:13.420 --> 00:38:14.620
All you know is this.

00:38:14.620 --> 00:38:19.400
And colloquially, what that
means is that the average

00:38:19.400 --> 00:38:29.000
speed is between the maximum
and the minimum.

00:38:29.000 --> 00:38:31.450
Not very surprising.

00:38:31.450 --> 00:38:34.930
The mean value theorem is
supposed to be very

00:38:34.930 --> 00:38:36.480
intuitively obvious.

00:38:36.480 --> 00:38:40.380
It's saying the average speed is
trapped between the maximum

00:38:40.380 --> 00:38:42.850
speed and the minimum speed.

00:38:42.850 --> 00:38:46.490
For sure, that's something,
that's why, incidentally this

00:38:46.490 --> 00:38:48.680
wasn't really proved
when Newton and

00:38:48.680 --> 00:38:50.350
Leibniz were around.

00:38:50.350 --> 00:38:52.860
But, let's write this so
that you can read it.

00:38:52.860 --> 00:39:01.350
Average speed is between
the max and the min.

00:39:01.350 --> 00:39:04.960
But nobody had any trouble,
they didn't disbelieve it

00:39:04.960 --> 00:39:09.750
because it's a very
natural thing.

00:39:09.750 --> 00:39:15.740
Now if, for example, I take
any kind of linear

00:39:15.740 --> 00:39:19.310
approximation; say, for
instance, e ^ x is

00:39:19.310 --> 00:39:25.670
approximately 1 + x.

00:39:25.670 --> 00:39:29.110
Then I'm making the
guess, now, don't

00:39:29.110 --> 00:39:30.620
want to say this yet.

00:39:30.620 --> 00:39:35.830
That's not going to explain
it to you well enough.

00:39:35.830 --> 00:39:38.690
What we're saying, so this
is the mean value here.

00:39:38.690 --> 00:39:40.840
This is what the mean
value theorem says.

00:39:40.840 --> 00:39:47.270
And here's the linear
approximation.

00:39:47.270 --> 00:39:52.140
The linear approximation is
saying that the average speed

00:39:52.140 --> 00:39:59.020
is approximately the
initial speed, or

00:39:59.020 --> 00:40:01.900
possibly the final speed.

00:40:01.900 --> 00:40:07.140
So if a is the left endpoint,
then it's the initial speed.

00:40:07.140 --> 00:40:09.690
If it happens to be the right
endpoint, if the value of x is

00:40:09.690 --> 00:40:13.460
to the left then it's
the final speed.

00:40:13.460 --> 00:40:16.640
So those are the - so you can
see it's approximately right.

00:40:16.640 --> 00:40:19.420
Because the speed, when you're
on a short interval, shouldn't

00:40:19.420 --> 00:40:20.530
be varying very much.

00:40:20.530 --> 00:40:22.430
The max and the min should
be pretty close together.

00:40:22.430 --> 00:40:25.630
So that's why the linear
approximation is reasonable.

00:40:25.630 --> 00:40:30.350
And this is telling you
absolutely, it's no less than

00:40:30.350 --> 00:40:34.410
the min and no more
than the max.

00:40:34.410 --> 00:40:34.640
Yeah.

00:40:34.640 --> 00:40:41.390
STUDENT: [INAUDIBLE]

00:40:41.390 --> 00:40:42.090
PROFESSOR: The little kink?

00:40:42.090 --> 00:40:46.110
STUDENT: [INAUDIBLE]

00:40:46.110 --> 00:40:47.740
PROFESSOR: If you approach
from the top.

00:40:47.740 --> 00:40:50.590
So if it's still under here
I can show you it again.

00:40:50.590 --> 00:40:51.590
Oh yeah, it's still there.

00:40:51.590 --> 00:40:51.900
Good.

00:40:51.900 --> 00:40:54.630
STUDENT: [INAUDIBLE]

00:40:54.630 --> 00:40:56.830
PROFESSOR: Oh, the one with
the wiggle on top?

00:40:56.830 --> 00:40:58.160
Yeah, this one you can't.

00:40:58.160 --> 00:41:00.130
Because there's nothing to touch
and it also fails from

00:41:00.130 --> 00:41:02.160
the bottom because there's
this bad point.

00:41:02.160 --> 00:41:04.250
From the top, it could work.

00:41:04.250 --> 00:41:05.550
It can certainly
work both ways.

00:41:05.550 --> 00:41:07.760
So, for example.

00:41:07.760 --> 00:41:10.900
See if you're a machine, you
maybe don't have a way of

00:41:10.900 --> 00:41:11.310
doing this.

00:41:11.310 --> 00:41:14.330
But if you're a human being you
can spot all the places.

00:41:14.330 --> 00:41:17.990
There are a bunch of spots
where the slope is right.

00:41:17.990 --> 00:41:20.770
And it's perfectly OK.

00:41:20.770 --> 00:41:21.780
All of them work.

00:41:21.780 --> 00:41:25.350
STUDENT: [INAUDIBLE]

00:41:25.350 --> 00:41:26.930
PROFESSOR: It's not that
the c is the same.

00:41:26.930 --> 00:41:30.530
It's just we've now found one,
two, three, four, five c's for

00:41:30.530 --> 00:41:31.160
which it works.

00:41:31.160 --> 00:41:37.660
STUDENT: [INAUDIBLE]

00:41:37.660 --> 00:41:41.820
PROFESSOR: If you're asked to
find a c, so first of all

00:41:41.820 --> 00:41:44.960
that's kind of a
phony question.

00:41:44.960 --> 00:41:47.280
There are some questions on your
problem set which ask you

00:41:47.280 --> 00:41:48.340
to find a c.

00:41:48.340 --> 00:41:51.930
That actually is struggling to
get you to understand what the

00:41:51.930 --> 00:41:56.060
statement of the mean value
theorem is, but you should not

00:41:56.060 --> 00:41:58.890
pay a lot of attention
to those questions.

00:41:58.890 --> 00:42:01.870
They're not very impressive.

00:42:01.870 --> 00:42:04.890
But, of course, you would have
to find all the - if it asked

00:42:04.890 --> 00:42:06.110
you to find one, you find one.

00:42:06.110 --> 00:42:10.950
If you can find some
more, fine.

00:42:10.950 --> 00:42:13.470
You can pick whichever
one you want.

00:42:13.470 --> 00:42:16.560
Mean value theorem just
doesn't care.

00:42:16.560 --> 00:42:19.380
The mean value theorem doesn't
care because actually, the

00:42:19.380 --> 00:42:24.730
mean value theorem is never
used except in real life,

00:42:24.730 --> 00:42:28.020
except in this context here.

00:42:28.020 --> 00:42:32.580
You can never nail down which c
it is, so the only thing you

00:42:32.580 --> 00:42:35.980
can say is that you're going
slower than the maximum speed

00:42:35.980 --> 00:42:40.500
and faster than the
minimum speed.

00:42:40.500 --> 00:42:41.330
Sorry, say that again?

00:42:41.330 --> 00:42:47.360
STUDENT: [INAUDIBLE]

00:42:47.360 --> 00:42:50.400
PROFESSOR: If you're asked for a
specific c, you have to find

00:42:50.400 --> 00:42:51.080
a specific c.

00:42:51.080 --> 00:42:53.070
And it has to be in the range.

00:42:53.070 --> 00:43:04.420
In between, it has
to be in here.

00:43:04.420 --> 00:43:07.200
So now I want to tell you
about another kind of

00:43:07.200 --> 00:43:11.100
application, which is really
just a consequence of what

00:43:11.100 --> 00:43:22.070
I've described here.

00:43:22.070 --> 00:43:26.490
I should emphasize, by the way,
this, probably, should be

00:43:26.490 --> 00:43:27.420
doing this.

00:43:27.420 --> 00:43:32.120
I guess we've never used
this color here.

00:43:32.120 --> 00:43:32.950
This popular.

00:43:32.950 --> 00:43:33.640
This is pink.

00:43:33.640 --> 00:43:35.480
So this one is so good.

00:43:35.480 --> 00:43:47.360
So since we're going
to do this.

00:43:47.360 --> 00:43:51.070
So the reason why the
exclamation points are

00:43:51.070 --> 00:43:54.150
temporary, this is such
an obvious fact.

00:43:54.150 --> 00:43:58.730
But this is the way that you're
going to want to use

00:43:58.730 --> 00:44:00.890
the mean value theorem, and this
is the only way you need

00:44:00.890 --> 00:44:02.670
to understand the mean
value theorem.

00:44:02.670 --> 00:44:06.520
On your test, or ever
in your whole life.

00:44:06.520 --> 00:44:10.630
So this is the way
it will be used.

00:44:10.630 --> 00:44:17.140
As I will make very clear when
we review for the exam.

00:44:17.140 --> 00:44:19.470
In practice what happens is you
even forget about the mean

00:44:19.470 --> 00:44:22.080
value theorem, and what you
remember is these three

00:44:22.080 --> 00:44:24.360
properties here.

00:44:24.360 --> 00:44:26.090
Which are themselves
consequences of

00:44:26.090 --> 00:44:27.720
the mean value theorem.

00:44:27.720 --> 00:44:31.950
So these are the ones that
I want to illustrate now.

00:44:31.950 --> 00:44:35.710
In my next discussion here.

00:44:35.710 --> 00:44:43.990
I'm just going to talk about
inequalities. inequalities are

00:44:43.990 --> 00:44:46.930
relationships between
functions.

00:44:46.930 --> 00:44:49.470
And I'm going to prove a couple
of them using the

00:44:49.470 --> 00:44:52.460
properties over there, the
properties that functions with

00:44:52.460 --> 00:44:56.900
positive derivatives
are increasing.

00:44:56.900 --> 00:45:08.390
Here's an example. e ^ x
&gt; 1 + x, where x &gt; 0.

00:45:08.390 --> 00:45:10.940
The proof is the following.

00:45:10.940 --> 00:45:16.070
I consider, so here's a proof.

00:45:16.070 --> 00:45:21.350
I consider the function f ( x ),
which is the difference. e

00:45:21.350 --> 00:45:27.360
^ x - (1 + x).

00:45:27.360 --> 00:45:35.680
I observe that it starts at f (
0 ) equal to, well, that's e

00:45:35.680 --> 00:45:42.110
^ 0 - (1 + 0), which is 0.

00:45:42.110 --> 00:45:48.100
And, it keeps on going.
f' (x) = e ^ x.

00:45:48.100 --> 00:45:50.310
If I differentiate here,
the 1 goes away.

00:45:50.310 --> 00:45:54.160
I get - 1.

00:45:54.160 --> 00:45:55.700
That's the derivative
of the function.

00:45:55.700 --> 00:45:58.855
And this function, because
e ^ x &gt; 1, for

00:45:58.855 --> 00:46:03.750
x positive is positive.

00:46:03.750 --> 00:46:06.370
As x gets bigger and
bigger, this rate

00:46:06.370 --> 00:46:08.290
of increase is positive.

00:46:08.290 --> 00:46:15.630
And therefore, three dots,
that's therefore, f ( x ) is

00:46:15.630 --> 00:46:18.460
bigger than its starting place.

00:46:18.460 --> 00:46:23.350
For x &gt; 0.

00:46:23.350 --> 00:46:27.220
If it's increasing, then that's,
in particular, it's

00:46:27.220 --> 00:46:28.730
increasing starting from 0.

00:46:28.730 --> 00:46:30.340
So this is true.

00:46:30.340 --> 00:46:36.000
Now, all I have to do is read
what this inequality says.

00:46:36.000 --> 00:46:39.972
And what it says is that e ^ x,
just plug in for f ( x ),

00:46:39.972 --> 00:46:45.130
which is right here. -( 1 + x)
is greater than the starting

00:46:45.130 --> 00:46:48.590
value, which was 0.

00:46:48.590 --> 00:46:52.050
Now, I put the thing that's
negative on the other side.

00:46:52.050 --> 00:47:01.550
So that's the same thing
as e^x &gt; 1 + x.

00:47:01.550 --> 00:47:04.330
That's a typical inequality.

00:47:04.330 --> 00:47:11.150
And now, we'll use this
principle again.

00:47:11.150 --> 00:47:12.900
Oh gee, I erased the
wrong thing.

00:47:12.900 --> 00:47:15.490
I erased the statement
and not the proof.

00:47:15.490 --> 00:47:23.340
Well, hide the proof.

00:47:23.340 --> 00:47:26.350
The next thing I want to prove
to you is that e ^ x &gt; 1

00:47:26.350 --> 00:47:33.090
+ x + (x^2 / 2).

00:47:33.090 --> 00:47:34.300
So, how do I do that?

00:47:34.300 --> 00:47:42.220
I introduce a function g (x),
which is e^x minus this.

00:47:42.220 --> 00:47:43.850
And now, I'm just going
to do exactly the

00:47:43.850 --> 00:47:45.780
same thing I did before.

00:47:45.780 --> 00:47:49.180
Which is, I get started
with g ( 0 ).

00:47:49.180 --> 00:47:51.870
Which is 1 - 1.

00:47:51.870 --> 00:47:53.680
Which is 0.

00:47:53.680 --> 00:48:00.640
And g' ( x ) is e ^ x minus -
now, look at what happens when

00:48:00.640 --> 00:48:03.590
I differentiate this.

00:48:03.590 --> 00:48:04.870
The 1 goes away.

00:48:04.870 --> 00:48:10.600
The x gives me a 1, and the
x^2 / 2 gives me a + x.

00:48:10.600 --> 00:48:18.190
And this one is positive for
x &gt; 0, because of step 1.

00:48:18.190 --> 00:48:21.840
Because of the previous
one that I did.

00:48:21.840 --> 00:48:28.340
So this one is increasing.
g is increasing.

00:48:28.340 --> 00:48:33.350
Which says that g
( x ) &gt; g ( 0 ).

00:48:33.350 --> 00:48:36.890
And if you just read that off,
it's exactly the same as our

00:48:36.890 --> 00:48:48.270
inequality here. e^x &gt;
1 + x + (x^2 / 2).

00:48:48.270 --> 00:48:54.010
Now, you can keep on going with
this essentially forever.

00:48:54.010 --> 00:48:58.510
And let me just write
down what you get.

00:48:58.510 --> 00:49:04.910
You get e ^ x &gt; 1
+ x + (x^2 / 2).

00:49:04.910 --> 00:49:09.365
The next one turns out
to be (x^3 / 3 * 2) +

00:49:09.365 --> 00:49:14.850
(x^4 / 4 * 3 * 2).

00:49:14.850 --> 00:49:16.820
And you can do whatever
you want.

00:49:16.820 --> 00:49:19.490
You can do others.

00:49:19.490 --> 00:49:22.860
And this is like the tortoise
and the hare.

00:49:22.860 --> 00:49:25.730
This is the tortoise,
and this is the

00:49:25.730 --> 00:49:27.740
hare, it's always ahead.

00:49:27.740 --> 00:49:31.910
But eventually, if you go
infinitely far, it catches up.

00:49:31.910 --> 00:49:35.720
So this turns out to
be exactly equal to

00:49:35.720 --> 00:49:38.190
e ^ x in the limit.

00:49:38.190 --> 00:49:39.580
And we'll talk about
that maybe at

00:49:39.580 --> 00:49:41.540
the end of the course.
