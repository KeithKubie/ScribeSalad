00:53:08.480 --> 00:53:13.130
so I hope this will be true currently
they still immunotherapy is minor

00:53:13.130 --> 00:53:13.140
they still immunotherapy is minor

they still immunotherapy is minor
fraction of the cancer treatment but

grow and more and more cancers may be
 

00:53:25.349 --> 00:53:30.430
grow and more and more cancers may be
treated by immunotherapy and someday I

00:53:30.430 --> 00:53:30.440
treated by immunotherapy and someday I

cancer may not completely disappear but

00:53:38.960 --> 00:53:38.970
cancer may not completely disappear but
 

00:53:38.970 --> 00:53:43.249
cancer may not completely disappear but
be controlled by immunotherapy cancer

that's okay

00:53:52.970 --> 00:53:52.980
that's okay
 

00:53:52.980 --> 00:53:55.999
that's okay
especially for elderly people
