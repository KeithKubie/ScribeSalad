00:00:00.011 --> 00:00:01.664
- [Instructor] Depending
on where you grow up

00:00:01.664 --> 00:00:05.238
in the United States, you
might hear a different story

00:00:05.238 --> 00:00:08.500
about the founding of this country.

00:00:08.500 --> 00:00:10.252
Now, I grew up in Pennsylvania

00:00:10.252 --> 00:00:12.460
and the story that I heard was about

00:00:12.460 --> 00:00:14.961
the Pilgrims landing at Plymouth Rock.

00:00:14.961 --> 00:00:18.593
They were a group of
deeply religious people,

00:00:18.593 --> 00:00:20.780
who had been persecuted in England

00:00:20.780 --> 00:00:23.062
and were looking for a new world,

00:00:23.062 --> 00:00:25.663
where they could practice
their religion freely,

00:00:25.663 --> 00:00:29.468
but many of my friends grew up in Virginia

00:00:29.468 --> 00:00:30.768
and the story they heard

00:00:30.768 --> 00:00:33.324
was about the founding of Jamestown,

00:00:33.324 --> 00:00:36.242
where a group of men from England,

00:00:36.242 --> 00:00:40.875
who were adventurers
looking for gold and glory,

00:00:40.875 --> 00:00:44.333
landed in the New World,
hoping to make a profit.

00:00:44.333 --> 00:00:47.267
And I think both of these
stories tells us a little bit

00:00:47.267 --> 00:00:51.196
about the founding mythology
of the United States.

00:00:51.196 --> 00:00:53.950
Were the original settlers here

00:00:53.950 --> 00:00:56.419
looking for religious freedom

00:00:56.419 --> 00:00:59.522
or were they here looking
to make a quick buck?

00:00:59.522 --> 00:01:01.705
Well, in this video I'd
like to take some time

00:01:01.705 --> 00:01:04.603
to explore the New England colonies,

00:01:04.603 --> 00:01:08.099
the story of the people
who landed at Plymouth Rock

00:01:08.099 --> 00:01:11.286
and then later, at Boston,
to begin the colony

00:01:11.286 --> 00:01:15.576
of Massachusetts Bay and
we'll see as we go along,

00:01:15.576 --> 00:01:19.347
just how different the settlers
in Massachusetts Bay were

00:01:19.347 --> 00:01:22.648
from those at Jamestown
and also some of the ways

00:01:22.648 --> 00:01:24.787
in which they were quite similar.

00:01:24.787 --> 00:01:27.334
Now, there's no question
about who got here first.

00:01:27.334 --> 00:01:31.167
As you can see, Jamestown
was founded in 1607,

00:01:32.022 --> 00:01:36.200
but it wasn't too much later
that the Pilgrims landed

00:01:36.200 --> 00:01:39.502
at Plymouth Rock in 1620,
and then they were followed

00:01:39.502 --> 00:01:42.438
by a much larger group of Puritans,

00:01:42.438 --> 00:01:46.605
who landed at Boston and founded
Massachusetts Bay in 1630.

00:01:47.718 --> 00:01:49.805
So let's talk about Puritans.

00:01:49.805 --> 00:01:52.222
So who or what was a Puritan?

00:01:53.504 --> 00:01:55.322
This is an image of Cotton Mather,

00:01:55.322 --> 00:01:58.578
he was a prominent Puritan minister,

00:01:58.578 --> 00:02:00.713
fact the Mather family
will go on to be one

00:02:00.713 --> 00:02:04.733
of the great theological
families of Massachusetts.

00:02:04.733 --> 00:02:08.900
Puritans started in England
and their main concern

00:02:09.863 --> 00:02:12.705
was that they believed
the Church of England,

00:02:12.705 --> 00:02:16.872
the Anglican Church, was too
much like the Catholic Church

00:02:19.314 --> 00:02:21.616
and this is a fairly legitimate criticism,

00:02:21.616 --> 00:02:24.050
because in many ways, the Anglican Church

00:02:24.050 --> 00:02:27.149
was very similar to the Catholic Church,

00:02:27.149 --> 00:02:31.429
except that instead of
being headed by the Pope,

00:02:31.429 --> 00:02:34.973
the Church of England was led by the king.

00:02:34.973 --> 00:02:38.306
So Puritans hoped that they could purify

00:02:39.323 --> 00:02:42.967
the Church of England from
its many Catholic influences.

00:02:42.967 --> 00:02:45.601
So that's where Puritan
comes from, purify,

00:02:45.601 --> 00:02:48.160
and by this, they meant that
there were too many rituals,

00:02:48.160 --> 00:02:50.295
too much pomp and circumstance,

00:02:50.295 --> 00:02:52.876
and not enough focus on the Bible itself.

00:02:52.876 --> 00:02:55.251
So they kind of wanted to strip away

00:02:55.251 --> 00:02:59.251
a lot of the fanciness
of the Church of England.

00:03:00.965 --> 00:03:04.781
In the 1620s, the Puritans began to face

00:03:04.781 --> 00:03:07.396
more persecution in England.

00:03:07.396 --> 00:03:11.214
Now, why did the English government care

00:03:11.214 --> 00:03:13.665
about a group of religious folks

00:03:13.665 --> 00:03:16.833
who were not big fans of
the Church of England?

00:03:16.833 --> 00:03:19.800
Well the answer is, that
there was no separation

00:03:19.800 --> 00:03:22.967
of church and state and so as the king

00:03:23.913 --> 00:03:28.806
was the head of the church,
if you're casting doubt

00:03:28.806 --> 00:03:32.970
on the church, you are then
casting doubt on the king

00:03:32.970 --> 00:03:35.950
and so the Puritans
did not make themselves

00:03:35.950 --> 00:03:39.280
very popular in England and sensing

00:03:39.280 --> 00:03:41.206
that they might be in trouble,

00:03:41.206 --> 00:03:45.622
many Puritans began to
emigrate to the new world.

00:03:45.622 --> 00:03:48.344
They'd seen lots of tracts about Virginia

00:03:48.344 --> 00:03:50.935
and how one could make a new life there

00:03:50.935 --> 00:03:52.680
and they thought that perhaps,

00:03:52.680 --> 00:03:56.232
if they went to Virginia and
they were originally aiming

00:03:56.232 --> 00:03:58.297
to go to Virginia, they ended up landing

00:03:58.297 --> 00:04:01.477
a bit north of there, that
they could set an example

00:04:01.477 --> 00:04:05.644
of what a righteous church
and a righteous society

00:04:07.602 --> 00:04:10.856
would look like, because
they believed that the church

00:04:10.856 --> 00:04:14.725
and the society of England
were becoming much too corrupt,

00:04:14.725 --> 00:04:18.892
much too divorced from the
principles of the Bible.

00:04:21.402 --> 00:04:24.152
So in 1620, one group of Puritans

00:04:25.678 --> 00:04:29.528
set out for the new world
and landed at Plymouth Rock

00:04:29.528 --> 00:04:31.232
and we call them the Pilgrims,

00:04:31.232 --> 00:04:34.565
and then in 1630, a second group set out

00:04:36.182 --> 00:04:39.290
and they were just Puritans more broadly.

00:04:39.290 --> 00:04:42.040
And over the course of the 1630s,

00:04:42.040 --> 00:04:45.707
about 14,000 Puritans
emigrated from England

00:04:46.981 --> 00:04:49.981
to New England, Massachusetts Bay,

00:04:49.981 --> 00:04:53.064
in what's called the great migration.

00:04:55.695 --> 00:04:58.269
So what was the difference
between these two groups,

00:04:58.269 --> 00:05:00.412
The Pilgrims and the Puritans?

00:05:00.412 --> 00:05:02.981
Well, the Pilgrims who arrived in 1620,

00:05:02.981 --> 00:05:06.398
they were separatists and what that means

00:05:08.660 --> 00:05:11.875
is that they thought that
the Church of England

00:05:11.875 --> 00:05:14.986
was so corrupt that
there was just no chance

00:05:14.986 --> 00:05:16.813
that they were going
to be able to save it.

00:05:16.813 --> 00:05:19.925
So they wanted to separate
from that church altogether

00:05:19.925 --> 00:05:23.289
and live a completely
separate life at Plymouth.

00:05:23.289 --> 00:05:26.878
They had a pretty small settlement,

00:05:26.878 --> 00:05:30.864
about a hundred people
crossed over on the Mayflower,

00:05:30.864 --> 00:05:33.261
the ship that brought
them to the New World,

00:05:33.261 --> 00:05:36.306
but the group that came over in 1630,

00:05:36.306 --> 00:05:39.724
the Puritans, they did
not want to separate

00:05:39.724 --> 00:05:42.538
from the Church of England altogether.

00:05:42.538 --> 00:05:45.040
They wanted to purify it and they hoped

00:05:45.040 --> 00:05:49.241
that by setting an example
of a righteous society,

00:05:49.241 --> 00:05:52.371
they would actually convince
people back in England

00:05:52.371 --> 00:05:55.142
to adopt their ways, invite them back,

00:05:55.142 --> 00:05:59.018
and that all of England could
become like New England.

00:05:59.018 --> 00:06:01.470
This man here is John Winthrop

00:06:01.470 --> 00:06:05.637
and he was a lawyer who became
a leader of the Puritans,

00:06:07.826 --> 00:06:10.732
he was elected governor pretty
much for his entire life

00:06:10.732 --> 00:06:13.384
and he wrote that he
wanted Massachusetts Bay

00:06:13.384 --> 00:06:15.801
to be like a city upon a hill

00:06:17.731 --> 00:06:20.001
and be a kind of a beacon of light,

00:06:20.001 --> 00:06:24.168
showing the world what a
good society could be like.

00:06:25.703 --> 00:06:28.214
Now, obviously the New England Puritans

00:06:28.214 --> 00:06:30.901
did not get their way,
they were not invited back

00:06:30.901 --> 00:06:34.735
to England to become the
model of English society,

00:06:34.735 --> 00:06:38.058
but they did become the model of society

00:06:38.058 --> 00:06:41.163
in Massachusetts Bay and
New England, more generally,

00:06:41.163 --> 00:06:43.441
and I think a strong influence

00:06:43.441 --> 00:06:45.918
on American culture, writ large.

00:06:45.918 --> 00:06:47.636
So how did life in New England

00:06:47.636 --> 00:06:49.589
compare to life in Virginia?

00:06:49.589 --> 00:06:53.672
Well, a lot depended on
the different environment

00:06:55.112 --> 00:06:58.000
of the colony and the reasons

00:06:58.000 --> 00:07:00.833
that migrants came to New England.

00:07:02.253 --> 00:07:05.574
Because the environment of New England

00:07:05.574 --> 00:07:08.324
was colder, the land was rockier,

00:07:10.994 --> 00:07:13.802
it was both a healthier place to live,

00:07:13.802 --> 00:07:17.885
because tropical diseases
couldn't flourish there

00:07:19.452 --> 00:07:22.723
the way that they could in
the marshy areas of Virginia

00:07:22.723 --> 00:07:25.980
and it was also the unsuitable place

00:07:25.980 --> 00:07:29.073
for large-scale plantation agriculture.

00:07:29.073 --> 00:07:33.100
So they couldn't grow the kinds of crops

00:07:33.100 --> 00:07:34.882
that Virginia grew, like tobacco

00:07:34.882 --> 00:07:37.585
or even sugar in the West Indies.

00:07:37.585 --> 00:07:39.403
So that meant that in New England,

00:07:39.403 --> 00:07:43.236
most of the industry was
either family farming

00:07:44.568 --> 00:07:47.401
and fishing and also some trading,

00:07:48.463 --> 00:07:50.837
since they were on the coast.

00:07:50.837 --> 00:07:54.632
And because most Puritans
came over to help build

00:07:54.632 --> 00:07:58.715
this city upon a hill,
they came in family units,

00:07:59.708 --> 00:08:02.433
not as single men, like in Virginia,

00:08:02.433 --> 00:08:06.600
so there was a much more
even ratio of men to women.

00:08:09.487 --> 00:08:13.592
The families that came over
tended to be well-off enough

00:08:13.592 --> 00:08:17.240
to pay their own passage
across the Atlantic,

00:08:17.240 --> 00:08:20.556
tended to be kind of
middle-class, artisan types

00:08:20.556 --> 00:08:24.530
and so New England didn't
have the kind of influx

00:08:24.530 --> 00:08:27.974
of indentured servants that Virginia had,

00:08:27.974 --> 00:08:32.099
nor did it have an influx
of enslaved Africans

00:08:32.099 --> 00:08:36.150
as laborers, because most New Englanders

00:08:36.150 --> 00:08:39.567
were farmers and they were small farmers,

00:08:41.317 --> 00:08:44.984
so they relied on their
own family as labor.

00:08:46.195 --> 00:08:49.976
So a major consequence
of these motivations

00:08:49.976 --> 00:08:53.338
for emigrating and this environment,

00:08:53.338 --> 00:08:57.506
was that New England society
was relatively egalitarian.

00:08:57.506 --> 00:09:01.173
There were very few
very wealthy landowners,

00:09:02.129 --> 00:09:03.813
like there were in Virginia,

00:09:03.813 --> 00:09:06.535
and very few people who were
completely at the bottom,

00:09:06.535 --> 00:09:09.316
like servants and enslaved people.

00:09:09.316 --> 00:09:12.895
People who lived in Virginia
had a life expectancy

00:09:12.895 --> 00:09:16.982
of up to 70 years, which
was one of the highest

00:09:16.982 --> 00:09:19.998
life expectancies in
the world at this time

00:09:19.998 --> 00:09:22.400
and because reading the Bible so important

00:09:22.400 --> 00:09:25.144
to the Puritans, New England also had one

00:09:25.144 --> 00:09:28.769
of the highest rates of literacy
in the world at this time,

00:09:28.769 --> 00:09:30.650
but for all of these positives,

00:09:30.650 --> 00:09:33.734
there were plenty of reasons
why living in New England

00:09:33.734 --> 00:09:35.611
wasn't so much fun.

00:09:35.611 --> 00:09:37.967
Most of them related to the strictness

00:09:37.967 --> 00:09:40.709
of the Congregational Church.

00:09:40.709 --> 00:09:43.042
Puritans canceled Christmas,

00:09:43.960 --> 00:09:47.185
that they thought was too
much of a pagan ritual

00:09:47.185 --> 00:09:50.992
and though you would think
that their own experience

00:09:50.992 --> 00:09:53.544
of religious intolerance in England

00:09:53.544 --> 00:09:55.637
would have led them to be more tolerant

00:09:55.637 --> 00:09:58.235
to dissidents, that was not the case.

00:09:58.235 --> 00:10:02.097
Anyone who disagreed
with a Puritan theology

00:10:02.097 --> 00:10:04.410
or leadership, was given the option

00:10:04.410 --> 00:10:07.950
to go somewhere else or be executed.

00:10:07.950 --> 00:10:12.111
For example, Roger
Williams, who questioned

00:10:12.111 --> 00:10:16.396
the Puritans' actions
toward Native Americans

00:10:16.396 --> 00:10:20.485
was expelled from
Massachusetts Bay in 1636

00:10:20.485 --> 00:10:24.113
and he went on to found
the colony of Rhode Island,

00:10:24.113 --> 00:10:28.280
where religious dissenters
could find a place of refuge

00:10:29.157 --> 00:10:31.977
from Massachusetts Bay, just as the people

00:10:31.977 --> 00:10:35.398
of Massachusetts Bay had
found refuge from England.

00:10:35.398 --> 00:10:37.876
One of these was a woman
named Anne Hutchinson,

00:10:37.876 --> 00:10:41.876
who in 1637, was expelled
from Massachusetts Bay

00:10:43.437 --> 00:10:47.419
for daring to be a woman
who preached the Bible.

00:10:47.419 --> 00:10:50.521
So in this video, I've
explored some of the background

00:10:50.521 --> 00:10:53.785
to Puritans and Pilgrims and aspects

00:10:53.785 --> 00:10:56.739
of New England society and religion.

00:10:56.739 --> 00:11:00.312
In the next video, we'll
continue our exploration

00:11:00.312 --> 00:11:03.479
of New England's life through its politics

00:11:03.479 --> 00:11:06.293
and policies toward Native Americans.
