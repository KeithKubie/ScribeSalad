different income categories and then we

00:12:45.740 --> 00:12:45.750
different income categories and then we
 

00:12:45.750 --> 00:12:48.710
different income categories and then we
matched dots you know by by geographic

00:15:02.790 --> 00:15:04.490
after we identified who the families
were we took basically the list of all

families one by one not all 2700 we we
 

00:15:09.449 --> 00:15:10.850
families one by one not all 2700 we we
categorized them i'd say we called about

said we had a team of five reporters and

00:16:44.990 --> 00:16:45.000
said we had a team of five reporters and
 

00:16:45.000 --> 00:16:46.730
said we had a team of five reporters and
two editors it really worked on this and

00:16:46.730 --> 00:16:46.740
two editors it really worked on this and
 

00:16:46.740 --> 00:16:48.230
two editors it really worked on this and
it was a partnership between the

00:16:48.230 --> 00:16:48.240
it was a partnership between the
 

00:16:48.240 --> 00:16:51.200
it was a partnership between the
investigative team and the education

00:16:51.200 --> 00:16:51.210
investigative team and the education
 

00:16:51.210 --> 00:16:53.780
investigative team and the education
team and I think that was really a great

00:16:53.780 --> 00:16:53.790
team and I think that was really a great
 

00:16:53.790 --> 00:16:55.820
team and I think that was really a great
model because you had your education

00:16:55.820 --> 00:16:55.830
model because you had your education
 

00:16:55.830 --> 00:16:57.170
model because you had your education
reporters who had all the sourcing and

00:16:57.170 --> 00:16:57.180
reporters who had all the sourcing and
 

00:16:57.180 --> 00:16:58.280
reporters who had all the sourcing and
then you had all your investigative

00:16:58.280 --> 00:16:58.290
then you had all your investigative
 

00:16:58.290 --> 00:17:00.710
then you had all your investigative
people who had you know a lot of you

00:17:00.710 --> 00:17:00.720
people who had you know a lot of you
 

00:17:00.720 --> 00:17:01.970
people who had you know a lot of you
know a lot of ideas about how to go

00:17:01.970 --> 00:17:01.980
know a lot of ideas about how to go
 

00:17:01.980 --> 00:17:04.550
know a lot of ideas about how to go
about creating databases and and just

00:17:04.550 --> 00:17:04.560
about creating databases and and just
 

00:17:04.560 --> 00:17:06.290
about creating databases and and just
some of the ways that you go searching

00:17:06.290 --> 00:17:06.300
some of the ways that you go searching
 

00:17:06.300 --> 00:17:09.260
some of the ways that you go searching
for records and so in terms of that I

00:17:09.260 --> 00:17:09.270
for records and so in terms of that I
 

00:17:09.270 --> 00:17:10.430
for records and so in terms of that I
think that the partner should work

00:17:10.430 --> 00:17:10.440
think that the partner should work
 

00:17:10.440 --> 00:17:12.920
think that the partner should work
really well and also I can talk about

00:17:12.920 --> 00:17:12.930
really well and also I can talk about
 

00:17:12.930 --> 00:17:14.600
really well and also I can talk about
like when we went out to do some of our

00:17:14.600 --> 00:17:14.610
like when we went out to do some of our
 

00:17:14.610 --> 00:17:17.180

we usually went in teams to with the

00:17:20.270 --> 00:17:20.280
we usually went in teams to with the
 

00:17:20.280 --> 00:17:23.630
we usually went in teams to with the
idea that that perhaps whoever we were

00:17:23.630 --> 00:17:23.640
idea that that perhaps whoever we were
 

00:17:23.640 --> 00:17:25.310

interviewing student parent whatever

00:17:25.310 --> 00:17:25.320

00:17:25.320 --> 00:17:28.310
interviewing student parent whatever
would react or you know interact better

00:17:28.310 --> 00:17:28.320

with one personality vs

00:17:30.280 --> 00:17:30.290
with one personality vs
 

00:17:30.290 --> 00:17:31.750
with one personality vs
another and we all had very different

00:17:31.750 --> 00:17:31.760
another and we all had very different
 

00:17:31.760 --> 00:17:33.910
another and we all had very different
personalities and different styles and I

00:17:33.910 --> 00:17:33.920
personalities and different styles and I
 

00:17:33.920 --> 00:17:35.290
personalities and different styles and I
think that that kind of worked for us

00:17:35.290 --> 00:17:35.300
think that that kind of worked for us
 

00:17:35.300 --> 00:17:38.170
think that that kind of worked for us
that we were able to do that and so

end it was the referee and you know got

00:18:20.050 --> 00:18:20.060
end it was the referee and you know got
 

00:18:20.060 --> 00:18:21.790
end it was the referee and you know got
us through it I think one of the points

00:18:21.790 --> 00:18:21.800
us through it I think one of the points
 

00:18:21.800 --> 00:18:24.160
us through it I think one of the points
touched on earlier in dealing with

00:18:24.160 --> 00:18:24.170
touched on earlier in dealing with
 

00:18:24.170 --> 00:18:26.500

people and Sue just gave another aspect

00:18:26.500 --> 00:18:26.510
people and Sue just gave another aspect
 

00:18:26.510 --> 00:18:28.450
people and Sue just gave another aspect
of it is is people do have different

00:18:28.450 --> 00:18:28.460
of it is is people do have different
 

00:18:28.460 --> 00:18:31.450
of it is is people do have different
personalities and when you're

00:18:31.450 --> 00:18:31.460
personalities and when you're
 

00:18:31.460 --> 00:18:33.070
personalities and when you're
interviewing somebody who was reluctant

00:18:33.070 --> 00:18:33.080
interviewing somebody who was reluctant
 

00:18:33.080 --> 00:18:35.080
interviewing somebody who was reluctant
to talk of getting a story out of them I

00:18:35.080 --> 00:18:35.090
to talk of getting a story out of them I
 

00:18:35.090 --> 00:18:36.970
to talk of getting a story out of them I
always felt that you had to establish

00:18:36.970 --> 00:18:36.980
always felt that you had to establish
 

00:18:36.980 --> 00:18:39.220
always felt that you had to establish
some sort of common connection or

00:18:39.220 --> 00:18:39.230
some sort of common connection or
 

00:18:39.230 --> 00:18:43.270
some sort of common connection or
empathy with them I mean yes you are a

00:18:43.270 --> 00:18:43.280
empathy with them I mean yes you are a
 

00:18:43.280 --> 00:18:47.320
empathy with them I mean yes you are a
reporter but people also had to suspend

00:18:47.320 --> 00:18:47.330
reporter but people also had to suspend
 

00:18:47.330 --> 00:18:49.240
reporter but people also had to suspend
their wariness of the fact that you

00:18:49.240 --> 00:18:49.250
their wariness of the fact that you
 

00:18:49.250 --> 00:18:51.580
their wariness of the fact that you
might be a reporter and communicate with

00:18:51.580 --> 00:18:51.590
might be a reporter and communicate with
 

00:18:51.590 --> 00:18:55.360
might be a reporter and communicate with
you on kind of a one-to-one basis and so

00:18:55.360 --> 00:18:55.370
you on kind of a one-to-one basis and so
 

00:18:55.370 --> 00:18:58.450
you on kind of a one-to-one basis and so
I know after a while with some of my law

00:18:58.450 --> 00:18:58.460
I know after a while with some of my law
 

00:18:58.460 --> 00:19:01.360
I know after a while with some of my law
enforcement sources over the years they

00:19:01.360 --> 00:19:01.370
enforcement sources over the years they
 

00:19:01.370 --> 00:19:04.090
enforcement sources over the years they
kind of forget I was a reporter and you

00:19:04.090 --> 00:19:04.100
kind of forget I was a reporter and you
 

00:19:04.100 --> 00:19:06.370
kind of forget I was a reporter and you
know they tell me stuff that they

00:19:06.370 --> 00:19:06.380
know they tell me stuff that they
 

00:19:06.380 --> 00:19:09.760
know they tell me stuff that they
probably shouldn't have told me but it

00:19:09.760 --> 00:19:09.770
probably shouldn't have told me but it
 

00:19:09.770 --> 00:19:11.200
probably shouldn't have told me but it
was just that there was a long-standing

00:19:11.200 --> 00:19:11.210
was just that there was a long-standing
 

00:19:11.210 --> 00:19:13.510
was just that there was a long-standing
kind of relationship so I think that's

00:19:13.510 --> 00:19:13.520
kind of relationship so I think that's
 

00:19:13.520 --> 00:19:15.790
kind of relationship so I think that's
important when you're dealing with

00:19:15.790 --> 00:19:15.800
important when you're dealing with
 

00:19:15.800 --> 00:19:18.460
important when you're dealing with
people you know the actual sources there

00:19:18.460 --> 00:19:18.470
people you know the actual sources there
 

00:19:18.470 --> 00:19:20.110
people you know the actual sources there
people when people you get to know over

00:19:20.110 --> 00:19:20.120
people when people you get to know over
 

00:19:20.120 --> 00:19:23.670
people when people you get to know over
a period of time and establishing

00:19:23.670 --> 00:19:23.680

00:19:23.680 --> 00:19:26.440
