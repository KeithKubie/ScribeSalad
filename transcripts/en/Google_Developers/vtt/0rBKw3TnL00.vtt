[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:00:09.400 --> 00:00:12.670
SPEAKER 1: Have you
played AppShip3000?

00:00:12.670 --> 00:00:14.420
TIMOTHY JORDAN: No,
but I'm ready to.

00:00:14.420 --> 00:00:18.170
And I'm standing here with Abe,
who helped build this fantastic

00:00:18.170 --> 00:00:18.670
experience.

00:00:18.670 --> 00:00:19.940
Abe, tell me all about it.

00:00:19.940 --> 00:00:21.640
ABE HASKINS: Yes,
this is AppShip3000.

00:00:21.640 --> 00:00:23.780
This is a collaborative,
Firebase trivia game,

00:00:23.780 --> 00:00:26.270
where three people work together
to launch their app ship

00:00:26.270 --> 00:00:27.920
and hit their moonshot.

00:00:27.920 --> 00:00:28.936
It's pretty crazy.

00:00:28.936 --> 00:00:30.560
Played with arcade
controllers out here

00:00:30.560 --> 00:00:32.012
in this very loud
situation, where

00:00:32.012 --> 00:00:34.220
it makes you yell to each
other and get all hyped up.

00:00:34.220 --> 00:00:35.730
And it's a lot of fun.

00:00:35.730 --> 00:00:35.970
TIMOTHY JORDAN: Awesome.

00:00:35.970 --> 00:00:37.190
So we're going to play it.

00:00:37.190 --> 00:00:38.900
And maybe I'll give
you the microphone,

00:00:38.900 --> 00:00:40.790
and you can sort of
narrate what's happening,

00:00:40.790 --> 00:00:42.200
and maybe talk a little
bit about the tech?

00:00:42.200 --> 00:00:42.890
ABE HASKINS: Absolutely.

00:00:42.890 --> 00:00:43.806
TIMOTHY JORDAN: Great.

00:00:43.806 --> 00:00:46.820
So for my fellow team players,
we've got Doug over here.

00:00:46.820 --> 00:00:48.650
Doug, take a bow.

00:00:48.650 --> 00:00:51.980
And Todd over here, who you
may know from such things

00:00:51.980 --> 00:00:53.270
as Everything Todd Does.

00:00:53.270 --> 00:00:56.040
[LAUGHTER]

00:00:56.040 --> 00:00:56.665
All right, Abe.

00:00:56.665 --> 00:00:57.914
I'm going to give you the mic.

00:00:57.914 --> 00:00:59.786
ABE HASKINS: All right, awesome.

00:00:59.786 --> 00:01:01.286
SPEAKER 2: Are we
already logged in?

00:01:01.286 --> 00:01:02.122
ABE HASKINS: Yup.

00:01:02.122 --> 00:01:03.830
Everyone's already
logged in, and they're

00:01:03.830 --> 00:01:06.500
sitting with their rocket
primed for ignition.

00:01:06.500 --> 00:01:08.930
In order to take off,
everyone has a specific color

00:01:08.930 --> 00:01:10.070
they need to hit.

00:01:10.070 --> 00:01:11.320
So let's give it a countdown.

00:01:11.320 --> 00:01:14.364
In three, two, one, takeoff.

00:01:14.364 --> 00:01:15.030
SPEAKER 2: Whoa!

00:01:15.030 --> 00:01:15.530
Go, go, go!

00:01:15.530 --> 00:01:16.571
ABE HASKINS: There we go.

00:01:16.571 --> 00:01:17.153
There we go.

00:01:17.153 --> 00:01:17.855
SPEAKER 2: Woo!

00:01:17.855 --> 00:01:19.730
ABE HASKINS: Now, in
the game of AppShip3000,

00:01:19.730 --> 00:01:21.104
the very first
thing that happens

00:01:21.104 --> 00:01:24.080
is you will get prompted to
ask, have you played before?

00:01:24.080 --> 00:01:26.210
Everyone here has.

00:01:26.210 --> 00:01:27.020
Good.

00:01:27.020 --> 00:01:28.520
And we'll dive
right into the game.

00:01:28.520 --> 00:01:29.520
The very first question.

00:01:29.520 --> 00:01:30.295
Who has it?

00:01:30.295 --> 00:01:31.131
SPEAKER 3: I got it.

00:01:31.131 --> 00:01:31.630
[INAUDIBLE]

00:01:31.630 --> 00:01:32.713
ABE HASKINS: There you go.

00:01:32.713 --> 00:01:33.466
There you go.

00:01:33.466 --> 00:01:33.902
SPEAKER 3: Oh, no!

00:01:33.902 --> 00:01:34.774
SPEAKER 2: Left, left!

00:01:34.774 --> 00:01:36.774
ABE HASKINS: Those blinking
things up at the top

00:01:36.774 --> 00:01:39.779
are asteroids, which will
absolutely destroy you.

00:01:39.779 --> 00:01:41.276
[CHATTER]

00:01:41.276 --> 00:01:42.272
SPEAKER 2: Left!

00:01:42.272 --> 00:01:43.272
ABE HASKINS: Good, good.

00:01:43.272 --> 00:01:45.268
[LAUGHTER]

00:01:47.264 --> 00:01:48.262
SPEAKER 2: I have 98.

00:01:48.262 --> 00:01:49.970
98?

00:01:49.970 --> 00:01:50.970
ABE HASKINS: Good, good.

00:01:50.970 --> 00:01:52.290
I'm amazed you knew that.

00:01:52.290 --> 00:01:53.235
Good job.

00:01:53.235 --> 00:01:57.594
[LAUGHS] How many Google
engineers does it take?

00:01:57.594 --> 00:02:01.080
[CHATTER]

00:02:01.930 --> 00:02:02.430
Lovely.

00:02:02.430 --> 00:02:04.910
Good call, good call.

00:02:04.910 --> 00:02:07.340
You can not be a
true Firebaser if you

00:02:07.340 --> 00:02:08.990
think pineapples are ugly.

00:02:11.799 --> 00:02:13.340
All right, while
this game's running,

00:02:13.340 --> 00:02:15.256
I'll talk a little bit
about what's happening.

00:02:15.256 --> 00:02:17.420
But it's a little
hard since they're all

00:02:17.420 --> 00:02:20.558
shouting all the time.

00:02:20.558 --> 00:02:21.989
SPEAKER 2: I have 93 and 01.

00:02:24.851 --> 00:02:25.805
ABE HASKINS: Wha--?

00:02:25.805 --> 00:02:27.934
SPEAKER 2: I have 93.

00:02:27.934 --> 00:02:28.434
[INAUDIBLE]

00:02:28.434 --> 00:02:29.430
SPEAKER 3: [INAUDIBLE] 94.

00:02:29.430 --> 00:02:30.450
ABE HASKINS: Somebody
pick something.

00:02:30.450 --> 00:02:31.574
You're running out of time.

00:02:31.574 --> 00:02:32.190
Oh-oh.

00:02:32.190 --> 00:02:33.116
SPEAKER 2: Oh-oh-oh.

00:02:33.116 --> 00:02:34.410
ABE HASKINS: All
right, all right.

00:02:34.410 --> 00:02:36.909
So while they're playing this
game, every movement they make

00:02:36.909 --> 00:02:39.560
is being thrown off into the
Firebase real-time database.

00:02:39.560 --> 00:02:41.550
And the real-time
database is taking that,

00:02:41.550 --> 00:02:44.100
doing some analysis, updating
high scores and things

00:02:44.100 --> 00:02:44.874
like that.

00:02:44.874 --> 00:02:46.290
So absolutely every
move they make

00:02:46.290 --> 00:02:48.500
is getting thrown off into
Google Cloud and Firebase

00:02:48.500 --> 00:02:51.164
for analysis.

00:02:51.164 --> 00:02:52.146
[LAUGHS]

00:02:53.128 --> 00:02:55.083
All right, all right.

00:02:55.083 --> 00:02:55.583
Oh.

00:02:55.583 --> 00:02:56.170
[GROANS]

00:02:56.170 --> 00:03:00.465
You got to watch out for
those asteroids, guys.

00:03:00.465 --> 00:03:01.840
SPEAKER 2: It's
not eight, is it?

00:03:01.840 --> 00:03:03.215
ABE HASKINS: No,
it is not eight.

00:03:03.215 --> 00:03:05.190
It is definitely not eight.

00:03:05.190 --> 00:03:06.400
Op, we're low on fuel.

00:03:06.400 --> 00:03:06.970
Low on fuel.

00:03:06.970 --> 00:03:09.005
If you miss this next
question, you are done.

00:03:09.005 --> 00:03:11.004
SPEAKER 2: What Firebase
product allows the user

00:03:11.004 --> 00:03:12.652
to search content
from [INAUDIBLE]?

00:03:12.652 --> 00:03:14.140
ABE HASKINS: Ah-ah-ah.

00:03:14.140 --> 00:03:15.250
Oh, you're so close.

00:03:15.250 --> 00:03:17.206
SPEAKER 2: Right, right,
right, right, right!

00:03:17.206 --> 00:03:17.872
ABE HASKINS: Oh!

00:03:22.096 --> 00:03:23.410
Oh.

00:03:23.410 --> 00:03:24.520
There you go.

00:03:24.520 --> 00:03:28.360
That is the end of your
voyage, coming in at 1,154.

00:03:28.360 --> 00:03:29.800
That is an OK score.

00:03:29.800 --> 00:03:32.650
That is supremely OK.

00:03:32.650 --> 00:03:33.470
Good job, everyone.

00:03:33.470 --> 00:03:35.302
Thanks for playing.

00:03:35.302 --> 00:03:37.024
[LAUGHS]

00:03:37.024 --> 00:03:38.315
TIMOTHY JORDAN: All right, Abe.

00:03:38.315 --> 00:03:39.140
Thanks so much for that.

00:03:39.140 --> 00:03:39.550
ABE HASKINS: Absolutely.

00:03:39.550 --> 00:03:40.370
Any time.

00:03:40.370 --> 00:03:41.000
TIMOTHY JORDAN:
So we're actually

00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:42.166
going to play another round.

00:03:42.166 --> 00:03:42.950
So, uh, bye.

00:03:42.950 --> 00:03:46.300
