Mike worked at McDonald's
for eight years,

00:00:02.902 --> 00:00:04.237
and I think we all know

00:00:04.270 --> 00:00:05.838
why he doesn't
work there anymore--

00:00:05.871 --> 00:00:07.473
they took away
all the incentives.

00:00:07.506 --> 00:00:10.343
I mean, they tore down
all the playgrounds.

00:00:16.749 --> 00:00:19.619
Really lucky that both your
opponents look like pedophiles.

00:00:19.652 --> 00:00:21.554
Uh...

00:00:21.587 --> 00:00:24.390
You know, people are asking me
tonight if I'm gonna

00:00:24.423 --> 00:00:26.092
put Sarah in her place.

00:00:26.125 --> 00:00:29.562
She's a 38-year-old woman
in comedy-- there isn't one.

00:00:31.730 --> 00:00:33.733
(gunshot sound effect plays)

00:00:39.138 --> 00:00:41.874
That's amazing.
That's funny. Uh...

00:00:41.907 --> 00:00:45.845
Mike hates sports, obviously.
Uh...

00:00:45.878 --> 00:00:48.948
For someone
who doesn't like sports,

00:00:48.981 --> 00:00:52.652
you sure do look
a lot like a 49er.

00:00:52.685 --> 00:00:55.755
Oh, it's Canada.
(bleep) me.

00:00:55.788 --> 00:00:58.024
Goddamn it.

00:00:58.057 --> 00:01:01.327
I'm sure someone will after.
Uh...

00:01:05.431 --> 00:01:07.800
Sarah's vagina is like a bar:

00:01:07.833 --> 00:01:10.136
it's dank, full of drunk dicks,

00:01:10.169 --> 00:01:12.905
and children are immediately
forced to leave.

00:01:12.938 --> 00:01:14.907
AUDIENCE:
Oh!

00:01:14.940 --> 00:01:16.876
(applause)
