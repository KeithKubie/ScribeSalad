00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.960
Hi I'm John Green, this is Crash Course US History, and today we're going to discuss Thomas Jefferson.

00:00:04.970 --> 00:00:09.590
We're going to learn about how America became
a thriving nation of small, independent farmers,

00:00:09.590 --> 00:00:11.680
eschewing manufacturing and world trade,

00:00:11.680 --> 00:00:18.860
and becoming the richest and most powerful nation in the world in the 19th century, all thanks to the vision of Thomas Jefferson,

00:00:18.860 --> 00:00:27.380
the greatest and most intellectually consistent Founding Father, who founded the University of Virginia and grew 20 varieties of peas at Monticello.

00:00:27.380 --> 00:00:29.340
Me From the Past, get to your desk!

00:00:29.340 --> 00:00:33.980
In a stunning turn of events, Me From the Past is an
idiot and Jefferson is more complicated than that.

00:00:33.980 --> 00:00:42.720
[Theme Music]

00:00:42.720 --> 00:00:49.780
So in 1800, Thomas Jefferson, pictured here â€“ this is the third time that we've featured Thomas Jefferson on the chalkboard, so we had to go a little Warhol on it.

00:00:49.780 --> 00:00:52.940
Right, so, Jefferson, the Republican, ran
against John Adams, the Federalist.

00:00:52.940 --> 00:00:57.559
1800 was the first election where both parties
ran candidates and actually campaigned.

00:00:57.560 --> 00:01:04.320
And, surprisingly, the Federalist's elitist strategy of "vote for Adams because he's better than you" did not work.

00:01:04.320 --> 00:01:13.900
Now, both parties realize that it was important to coordinate their electoral strategy to make sure that the vice presidential candidate got at least one fewer electoral votes than the presidential candidate.

00:01:13.900 --> 00:01:21.640
But then the Republican elector who was supposed to throw his vote away forgot to, so there ended up being a tie between Thomas Jefferson and Aaron Burr.

00:01:21.640 --> 00:01:30.200
As per the Constitution, the election went to the House of Representatives, where it took 36 ballots and the intervention of Alexander Hamilton before Jefferson was finally named president.

00:01:30.200 --> 00:01:36.840
Incidentally, Burr and Hamilton really disliked each other, and not in like, the passive-aggressive way that politicians dislike each other these days,

00:01:36.840 --> 00:01:41.160
but in the four-years-later-they-would-have-a-duel-and-Burr-killed-Hamilton kind of way.

00:01:41.160 --> 00:01:45.460
A duel which occurred, wait for it, in New
Jersey.

00:01:45.460 --> 00:01:55.200
But anyway, shortly after the election of 1800, the 12th Amendment was passed, making the Electoral College simpler, but not as simple as, say, you know, one person's vote counting as one vote.

00:01:55.200 --> 00:02:02.440
Anyway, complain about the Electoral College all you want, but without it, we would never have had President Rutherford B. Hayes, and just look at that beard!

00:02:02.440 --> 00:02:10.820
So Jefferson became president and his election showed that Americans wanted a more democratic politics, where common people were more free to express their opinions.

00:02:10.820 --> 00:02:14.340
The Federalists were never really a threat again in presidential politics.

00:02:14.340 --> 00:02:22.080
And, arguably, the best thing that John Adams ever did was transfer power in an orderly and honorable way to his rival, Jefferson.

00:02:22.080 --> 00:02:27.920
Jefferson's campaign slogan was "Jefferson and Liberty," but the liberty in question was severely limited.

00:02:27.920 --> 00:02:32.720
Only a fraction of white men were allowed to vote and, of course, there was no liberty for the slaves.

00:02:32.720 --> 00:02:43.360
There's a lot of contentious debate on the subject of Jefferson and slavery, but here's my two cents, which I should not be allowed to contribute because we should only round to the nearest nickel, which, by the way, features Thomas Jefferson.

00:02:43.360 --> 00:02:52.300
So Thomas Jefferson was a racist and he wrote about black people's inherent inferiority to whites and Native Americans, and the fact that he fathered children with one of his slaves doesn't change that.

00:02:52.300 --> 00:02:55.400
George Washington freed his slaves
upon his death. Well, sort of.

00:02:55.400 --> 00:03:03.980
They were supposed to be freed upon his wife's death, but living in a house full of people who were waiting for you to die made Martha want to free them while she was still alive.

00:03:03.980 --> 00:03:11.200
But with few exceptions, Jefferson didn't free his slaves upon his death and throughout his life, he used the sale of slaves to finance his lavish lifestyle.

00:03:11.200 --> 00:03:14.920
And this leads to two big philosophical questions
when it comes to history.

00:03:14.920 --> 00:03:23.160
First, if Jefferson clearly did not think that black people were the intellectual or moral equals of whites and was perfectly comfortable keeping them in bondage,

00:03:23.160 --> 00:03:27.960
then what does the most important phrase of the Declaration of Independence actually mean?

00:03:27.960 --> 00:03:29.660
And the second question is even broader:

00:03:29.660 --> 00:03:34.680
Does it matter if a person of tremendous historical
importance had terrible aspects to their character?

00:03:34.680 --> 00:03:37.230
Does being a bad person diminish your accomplishments?

00:03:37.230 --> 00:03:42.130
I don't have a great answer for those questions, but I will tell you that no remembers Richard Nixon for starting the EPA.

00:03:42.130 --> 00:03:47.220
But this is very important to understand: Slaves were aware of concept of liberty and they wanted it.

00:03:47.220 --> 00:03:52.020
So in addition to an election, 1800 also saw
one of the first large-scale slave uprisings.

00:03:52.020 --> 00:04:01.160
Gabriel's Rebellion was organized by a Richmond, Virginia blacksmith who hoped to seize the capital, kill some of its inhabitants, and hold the rest hostage until his demands for abolition were met.

00:04:01.160 --> 00:04:06.040
But the plot was discovered before they could carry it out and Gabriel, along with 25 other slaves, was hanged.

00:04:06.040 --> 00:04:12.640
But after the rebellion, Virginians, if they didn't know it already, were very aware that slaves wanted and expected liberty.

00:04:12.650 --> 00:04:17.090
And the response was predictable: Virginia
made its laws concerning slaves much harsher.

00:04:17.090 --> 00:04:25.710
It became illegal for slaves to meet in groups on Sundays unless supervised by whites, and it became much more difficult for whites to legally free their slaves.

00:04:25.710 --> 00:04:29.790
Oh, it's time for the Mystery Document?

00:04:29.790 --> 00:04:31.160
The rules here are simple:

00:04:31.170 --> 00:04:35.400
Identify the author, no shock;
fail to identify the author, shock.

00:04:35.400 --> 00:04:41.220
"The love of freedom, sir, is an inborn sentiment,
which the god of nature has planted deep in the heart:

00:04:41.220 --> 00:04:45.100
long may it be kept under by the arbitrary
institutions of society;

00:04:45.100 --> 00:04:51.680
but, at the first favorable moment, it springs forth,
and flourishes with a vigour that defies all check.

00:04:51.680 --> 00:05:00.920
This celestial spark, which fires the breast of the savage, which glows in that of the philosopher, is not extinguished in the bosom of the slave.

00:05:00.920 --> 00:05:06.520
It may be buried in the embers; but it still lives;
and the breath of knowledge kindles it to flame.

00:05:06.520 --> 00:05:13.500
Thus we find, sir, there have never been slaves in any country who have not seized the first favorable opportunity to revolt."

00:05:13.500 --> 00:05:18.400
I mean, from the bit at the beginning about the love of freedom, it seems like it could be Jefferson, but the rest does not seem like Jefferson.

00:05:18.400 --> 00:05:26.180
Probably wasn't a slave, since they were denied access to education precisely because the "breath of knowledge" is so dangerous to the institution of slavery.

00:05:26.180 --> 00:05:31.660
Oh, this is looking pretty bleak for me, Stan.
Mmmmmm. John Jay?

00:05:31.660 --> 00:05:32.800
[buzzing noise] Dang it!

00:05:32.800 --> 00:05:35.240
Who was it? George Tucker?!

00:05:35.240 --> 00:05:37.820
Who the John C. Calhoun is George Tucker?!

00:05:37.830 --> 00:05:41.840
Is there a person watching this who knew that
it was George Tucker?

00:05:41.840 --> 00:05:44.480
Fine! [electricity noise] Gah!

00:05:44.480 --> 00:05:54.540
Apparently George Tucker was a member of the General Assembly of Virginia and the Mystery Document was a description of Gabriel's Rebellion that suggested a solution to the inherent problem of rebellious slaves.

00:05:54.540 --> 00:06:01.560
He argued that we should set up a colony for them in Indian territory in Georgia, which, of course, also wouldn't have worked because we were soon to steal that territory.

00:06:01.560 --> 00:06:02.759
But back to Jefferson.

00:06:02.760 --> 00:06:12.020
His idea was to make the government smaller, lower taxes, shrink the military, and make it possible for America to become a bucolic, agrarian, empire of liberty,

00:06:12.020 --> 00:06:16.440
rather than an English-style, industrial, mercantile, nightmare landscape.

00:06:16.440 --> 00:06:18.620
So how did he do?
Well, really well at first.

00:06:18.620 --> 00:06:22.780
Jefferson got rid of all the taxes, except
for the tariff, especially the Whiskey Tax.

00:06:22.780 --> 00:06:27.900
And then, when he woke up with a terrible, cheap whiskey-induced hangover, he paid off part of the national debt.

00:06:27.900 --> 00:06:35.680
He shrunk the army and the navy, and basically made sure that America wouldn't become a centralized, English-style state for at least the next 60 years.

00:06:35.680 --> 00:06:39.000
Low taxes and small government sounds great,
but no navy?

00:06:39.000 --> 00:06:50.260
That would be tough, especially when we needed ships and marines to fight the Barbary pirates "on the shores of Tripoli," who kept capturing our ships in the Mediterranean and enslaving their crews.

00:06:50.260 --> 00:06:54.600
This is yet another example of how foreign affairs
keeps getting in the way of domestic priorities;

00:06:54.600 --> 00:06:58.220
in this case, the domestic priority of not
wanting to spend money on a navy.

00:06:58.220 --> 00:07:04.160
Also, vitally, Jefferson's presidency really marks the last time in history when a Republican president didn't want to spend money on the military.

00:07:04.160 --> 00:07:07.280
Don't get me wrong: Democrats can do it too.
I'm looking at you, LBJ.

00:07:07.280 --> 00:07:16.120
As much as he wanted to get rid of any trace of the Federalists, Jefferson found himself thwarted by that imminently conservative and undemocratic institution: the Supreme Court.

00:07:16.120 --> 00:07:22.139
Jefferson appointed Republicans to most government positions, but he couldn't do anything about the Supreme Court because they serve for life.

00:07:22.139 --> 00:07:25.559
And since the country was only like, 12 years
old, they were all still pretty fresh.

00:07:25.560 --> 00:07:29.480
Most important among them was Chief Justice
John Marshall, who happened to be a Federalist.

00:07:29.480 --> 00:07:35.700
Marshall was Chief Justice basically forever and is, without question, the most important figure in the history of the Supreme Court.

00:07:35.700 --> 00:07:41.460
He wrote a number of key opinions, but none was more important than the 1803 decision in Marbury v. Madison.

00:07:41.460 --> 00:07:51.360
Marbury v. Madison is so important because in that decision, the Supreme Court gave itself the power of judicial review, which allows it to uphold or invalidate federal laws.

00:07:51.360 --> 00:07:56.260
The Court then extended this power to state laws in Fletcher v. Peck and eventually even to executive actions.

00:07:56.260 --> 00:08:04.280
Like, we think of the main job of the Supreme Court being to declare laws unconstitutional, but that power isn't anywhere in the Constitution itself.

00:08:04.280 --> 00:08:10.240
Marbury v. Madison gave the Court that power and without it, the Supreme Court would probably be a footnote in American history.

00:08:10.240 --> 00:08:14.840
So unlike Marshall, Jefferson and the Republicans
were big proponents of strict construction:

00:08:14.840 --> 00:08:20.180
the idea that the Constitution should be read as literally as possible as way of limiting the power of the federal government.

00:08:20.180 --> 00:08:31.640
The problem is, there might be things the government wants to do that the Constitution didn't account for, like, for instance, buying a large tract of land from Napoleon, who, as we remember from Crash Course World History, complicates everything.

00:08:31.640 --> 00:08:32.840
Let's go to the Thought Bubble.

00:08:32.840 --> 00:08:37.740
So yeah, Jefferson basically doubled the size of the US in what came to be known as the Louisiana Purchase.

00:08:37.740 --> 00:08:44.300
Napoleon was eager to sell it, because the rebellion in Haiti had soured him on the whole idea of colonies, and also because he needed money.

00:08:44.300 --> 00:08:52.020
Jefferson wanted to purchase New Orleans because western farmers were shipping their products through the city and when he approached France about this, Napoleon was like,

00:08:52.020 --> 00:08:54.920
"Hey! How bout I sell you, this!"

00:08:54.920 --> 00:09:02.040
Jefferson couldn't turn down that deal, so he bought the whole kit and caboodle for $15 million, which is worth about $250 million today.

00:09:02.040 --> 00:09:08.640
To put that into perspective, a new aircraft carrier
costs about $4.5 billion, so he got a good deal.

00:09:08.640 --> 00:09:09.920
What's the problem with this?

00:09:09.920 --> 00:09:14.100
Well, nothing if you believe in a powerful government that can do stuff that's not in the Constitution.

00:09:14.100 --> 00:09:25.680
But if you're a strict Constructionist like Jefferson, you have to reconcile this obviously beneficial act with there being no mention in the Constitution of the president being able to purchase land in order to expand the size of the US.

00:09:25.680 --> 00:09:33.880
So laying scruple aside, Jefferson bought Louisiana and then sent Lewis and Clark to explore it, which they did, even going beyond the boundaries of the Purchase all the way to the Pacific.

00:09:33.880 --> 00:09:40.940
And this was so cool that it almost makes us forget that it was kind of unconstitutional and a huge power grab for the president.

00:09:40.940 --> 00:09:43.320
So the question is: why did he do it?

00:09:43.320 --> 00:09:47.540
Jefferson's desire to increase the size of the
country prompted Federalists to complain that,

00:09:47.540 --> 00:09:52.540
"We are to give money, of which we have too
little, for land, of which we already have too much."

00:09:52.540 --> 00:09:58.720
By doubling the size of the country, Jefferson could ensure that there would be enough land for every white man to have his own small farm.

00:09:58.720 --> 00:10:03.320
And this, in turn, would ensure that Americans
would remain independent and virtuous.

00:10:03.320 --> 00:10:15.460
Because only a small farmer who doesn't have to depend on the market for food or shelter or anything really (well, except slaves), can be truly independent, and thus capable of participating in a nation of free men.

00:10:15.460 --> 00:10:16.600
Thanks, Thought Bubble.

00:10:16.600 --> 00:10:24.420
And this desire to create a nation of independent farmers producing only primary products helps explains Jefferson's other incredibly controversial policy: the embargo.

00:10:24.420 --> 00:10:35.680
Jefferson imposed the embargo in order to punish Britain for its practice of impressing American sailors, as well as its blockade of France, with whom Britain was once again, or possibly just still, at war.

00:10:35.680 --> 00:10:43.140
So basically, Jefferson wanted free trade among nations and his solution was to get Congress to forbid all American ships from sailing to foreign ports.

00:10:43.140 --> 00:10:53.140
The theory was that the British were so dependent on American primary products, like wood and cotton, that if we cut off trade with them, the British would stop impressing American sailors and end their blockade.

00:10:53.140 --> 00:10:56.720
What's the connection between free trade and
Jefferson's agrarian ideal?

00:10:56.720 --> 00:11:04.940
Well, the idea was that America would trade its primary products for Europe's manufactured goods, so that the US wouldn't have to develop any manufacturing capacity of its own.

00:11:04.940 --> 00:11:07.800
Alas, or perhaps fortunately, this did not
work.

00:11:07.800 --> 00:11:11.900
For one thing, Britain and France were too busy fighting each other even to notice America's embargo.

00:11:11.900 --> 00:11:14.160
So they just continued blockading and impressing.

00:11:14.170 --> 00:11:16.730
Also, the embargo devastated the American
economy.

00:11:16.730 --> 00:11:18.890
I mean, exports dropped by 80%.

00:11:18.890 --> 00:11:25.550
Furthermore, not being able to import European manufactured goods only served to spur American manufacturing.

00:11:25.550 --> 00:11:35.620
I mean, Jefferson might have wanted Americans to be a bunch of self-sufficient farmers, but Americans wanted European manufactured stuff, like teapots and clocks and microwaves.

00:11:35.620 --> 00:11:37.600
Well, then how did they cook stuff, Stan?

00:11:37.600 --> 00:11:40.860
And if they couldn't get that stuff from Britain,
they would just make it themselves.

00:11:40.860 --> 00:11:45.580
So in terms of Jefferson's agrarian ideal,
the embargo was a massive failure.

00:11:45.580 --> 00:11:51.100
And lastly, the embargo limited the power of the federal government about as much as crystal meth limits cavities.

00:11:51.100 --> 00:11:56.760
I mean, imposing the embargo was a colossal use of federal power and it was also an imposition on people's liberties.

00:11:56.760 --> 00:12:02.860
The problem the embargo was supposed to solve didn't go away and, as we'll discuss next week, it eventually led to the US's first declared war.

00:12:02.860 --> 00:12:09.200
For now, I want to leave you with this: Thomas Jefferson is revered and reviled in almost equal measure in American history.

00:12:09.200 --> 00:12:19.080
The Declaration of Independence, which he mainly drafted, is a signal achievement delineating some heroic ideas for the founding of the United States, but also embedding some of its crucial shortcomings.

00:12:19.080 --> 00:12:21.180
And Jefferson's presidency is like that too.

00:12:21.180 --> 00:12:27.220
He claimed to champion small government, but he enlarged federal power more than Washington or Adams ever did.

00:12:27.220 --> 00:12:32.080
He imagined an agrarian republic, but his
policies led to increased manufacturing.

00:12:32.080 --> 00:12:36.400
He wanted to foster freedom, but he owned
slaves and took land from the Indians.

00:12:36.400 --> 00:12:44.940
In the end, Jefferson's life and policies encapsulate the best and the worst of us, which is why his presidency is still worth studying closely.

00:12:44.950 --> 00:12:46.870
I'll see you next week.

00:12:46.870 --> 00:12:49.550
