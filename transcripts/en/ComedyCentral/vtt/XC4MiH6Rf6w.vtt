(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)

00:00:08.542 --> 00:00:09.610
TUMBLR IS A PLATFORM THAT

00:00:09.610 --> 00:00:10.744
MAKES IT INCREDIBLY EASY TO SET

00:00:10.744 --> 00:00:12.145
UP A BLOG, EVEN IF THERE'S

00:00:12.145 --> 00:00:13.280
REALLY NO EARTHLY REASON THAT

00:00:13.280 --> 00:00:14.948
THAT BLOG NEEDS TO EXIST.

00:00:14.948 --> 00:00:16.049
SO WE'LL GIVE YOU A CHOICE OF

00:00:16.049 --> 00:00:17.284
TWO RIDICULOUS TUMBLRS, YOU HAVE

00:00:22.956 --> 00:00:24.157
"TURDS OF PORTLAND, PICTURES

00:00:24.157 --> 00:00:25.325

PORTLAND".

00:00:26.159 --> 00:00:31.298
(LAUGHTER)

00:00:31.298 --> 00:00:34.001
A LITTLE P.O.O. IN THE P.D.X.

ANYONE WHO CAN PHYSICALLY

00:00:49.716 --> 00:00:52.119
TUMBLE.

00:00:52.119 --> 00:00:53.086
