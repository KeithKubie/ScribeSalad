1
00:00:01,320 --> 00:00:04,200
Hey, what's going on? And spilled burn
is time for the Thursday afternoon,

2
00:00:04,201 --> 00:00:08,790
just before Friday, Monday
morning podcast and Jess jacket.

3
00:00:10,250 --> 00:00:10,680
Yay.

4
00:00:10,680 --> 00:00:13,850
Do you,
how was your week going?

5
00:00:14,990 --> 00:00:19,760
Is it going well? I am in
gloomy, rainy, Vancouver,

6
00:00:22,430 --> 00:00:24,620
British Columbia home with the BC lions,

7
00:00:24,621 --> 00:00:29,621
the Vancouver Canucks and
no fucking Westminster dog
show know there's someplace

8
00:00:31,520 --> 00:00:32,450
out here at Westminster.

9
00:00:32,451 --> 00:00:34,700
And I learned today that they
do have a big dog show up here,

10
00:00:34,701 --> 00:00:36,440
but I don't think they
are one in the same.

11
00:00:37,490 --> 00:00:40,670
I can't remember if Westminster
takes place in Beverly Hills

12
00:00:42,890 --> 00:00:43,701
or in New York City,

13
00:00:43,701 --> 00:00:48,701
but all I know is that you have to be
a particular level white person to be

14
00:00:50,691 --> 00:00:54,380
invited. I learned that because
I thought I was white enough,

15
00:00:55,610 --> 00:00:59,360
you know, and they were
like, uh Oh no, you are not.

16
00:01:00,110 --> 00:01:05,030
And uh,
my dream of attending it was over.

17
00:01:06,370 --> 00:01:08,420
Um, I just think it's funny. I like dogs.

18
00:01:08,450 --> 00:01:11,690
And then it's just funny when they
get them all like, you know, oh,

19
00:01:11,691 --> 00:01:15,350
shampooed up and they're prancing around,
you know,

20
00:01:15,740 --> 00:01:16,860
and I don't know,

21
00:01:17,420 --> 00:01:22,420
there's always like that thought of
what if the owner false just adds to the

22
00:01:23,481 --> 00:01:27,320
tension, you know? Um, anyways,
I'm up here in Vancouver.

23
00:01:27,321 --> 00:01:32,180
I'm having a great time. Uh, this
past weekend I went to a wedding,

24
00:01:33,920 --> 00:01:38,600
uh, awesome wedding, tremendous wedding.
Two people that should be getting married.

25
00:01:38,601 --> 00:01:40,190
They totally had the connection.

26
00:01:40,640 --> 00:01:45,110
Is there anything worse unless
you just really into shine Freud.

27
00:01:45,900 --> 00:01:48,170
Um, when you go to a wedding and you
just see two people and you're like,

28
00:01:48,171 --> 00:01:52,430
this fucking thing is not going to last
the weekend I've been to two of those

29
00:01:53,180 --> 00:01:54,590
and one of them,

30
00:01:54,620 --> 00:01:58,580
the marriage lasted two years maybe.

31
00:01:58,640 --> 00:02:02,720
And then the other one, as far as
I know, they're still together. Um,

32
00:02:02,750 --> 00:02:05,030
the first weird wedding that I went to,

33
00:02:06,820 --> 00:02:11,710
I think the bride was having second
thoughts because the groom was standing up

34
00:02:11,711 --> 00:02:15,150
there forever
and then she just showed a,

35
00:02:16,640 --> 00:02:19,950
walked down the hall, walked
on down the hall, right.

36
00:02:20,070 --> 00:02:23,160
Walk down the aisle was there dad

37
00:02:25,230 --> 00:02:28,770
and did not have that look that,
you know,

38
00:02:29,700 --> 00:02:33,810
somebody usually has on their wedding day.
Um,

39
00:02:34,890 --> 00:02:38,940
and then when she went up to the altar
the whole time they were doing the vows,

40
00:02:39,180 --> 00:02:43,830
she was laughing uncontrollably.
Um, which, you know,

41
00:02:43,831 --> 00:02:48,420
sometimes it's just a form
of nervousness, but, uh,

42
00:02:48,600 --> 00:02:53,160
they didn't even kiss. And as they walked
out, they went ahead and kiss. But uh,

43
00:02:53,730 --> 00:02:58,580
as far as I know, they're still
together. And then another one was, uh,

44
00:02:59,080 --> 00:03:04,060
someone I was in business with when I
first got in to New York City and I went

45
00:03:04,960 --> 00:03:08,410
to this person's wedding and
I remember we went out there

46
00:03:10,510 --> 00:03:11,440
and,
uh,

47
00:03:11,500 --> 00:03:16,390
the mother-in-law we got there like
what was traffic when we got there right

48
00:03:16,391 --> 00:03:18,490
before the wedding was going to start,

49
00:03:18,491 --> 00:03:21,580
it was in the backyard of these
rich people's, uh, state, right?

50
00:03:21,580 --> 00:03:25,420
This guy married into money and he wasn't
rich, so I think they didn't like him.

51
00:03:25,421 --> 00:03:27,040
So she was,
we pulled up,

52
00:03:27,041 --> 00:03:32,041
she was outside walking the dog
dressed the way you would walk a dog.

53
00:03:32,590 --> 00:03:34,240
Like she wasn't really even ready.

54
00:03:34,241 --> 00:03:39,241
It was like sort of this nonverbal protest
of what was going on in there and uh,

55
00:03:43,150 --> 00:03:45,040
that seemed weird. I
was like, wow. You know,

56
00:03:45,160 --> 00:03:48,430
the inlaws usually never liked the
fucking person that daughter's marrying.

57
00:03:48,550 --> 00:03:53,360
They never think that he's good enough.
Right. So it didn't really, you know,

58
00:03:53,390 --> 00:03:57,790
it wasn't much of a red flag. But
then I just remembered when, uh,

59
00:03:57,820 --> 00:04:01,450
the groom apps to where they
got married, he went to, uh,

60
00:04:01,540 --> 00:04:06,130
give a toast as to why he loved
his wife and it was fucking brutal.

61
00:04:06,700 --> 00:04:11,020
He was like, uh, she, cause
she gave some big toast to him.

62
00:04:11,090 --> 00:04:15,730
So then he goes, okay, uh, and
Dan to you, my lovely wife, you,

63
00:04:17,500 --> 00:04:20,890
uh, you, you, you make me laugh. Uh,

64
00:04:22,090 --> 00:04:25,750
where the background like lighter your
life reason you get up in the morning,

65
00:04:25,930 --> 00:04:26,830
like trying to help him out.

66
00:04:27,310 --> 00:04:30,430
It was one of those things where everyone
was smiling like this is going to be

67
00:04:30,431 --> 00:04:33,160
great. And then it just became like,
everyone just started looking down,

68
00:04:33,161 --> 00:04:36,070
going to wrap it up,
wrap it up, wrap it up.

69
00:04:36,820 --> 00:04:41,050
And that one lasted like two years
and it was such a fucked up marriage.

70
00:04:42,160 --> 00:04:43,360
I remember him telling me

71
00:04:45,100 --> 00:04:48,310
that they just had this big fight
and they were both kind of exhausted

72
00:04:49,960 --> 00:04:52,150
and one of them was just kind of like,
what are we doing?

73
00:04:52,960 --> 00:04:54,550
And the other one who was his psych,
yeah,

74
00:04:54,551 --> 00:04:59,290
do you like not want to do this anymore?
And the other one was like,

75
00:04:59,320 --> 00:05:03,670
no. And then the other one was like,
really? Because I don't either.

76
00:05:03,671 --> 00:05:08,671
And then they started laughing like a
bad fucking movie and they had a really

77
00:05:10,050 --> 00:05:13,330
amiable divorce.
And I think he was cool.

78
00:05:13,331 --> 00:05:17,560
He didn't try to take any of her fucking
money and they just went their separate

79
00:05:17,561 --> 00:05:22,450
ways. Having said that,
this wedding that I went to,

80
00:05:23,110 --> 00:05:26,050
I always have that in the back of my
head because as much as I like to do

81
00:05:26,580 --> 00:05:30,130
standup, I don't literally like to be
living in a bit when I'm at a wedding,

82
00:05:30,700 --> 00:05:34,330
you know? Um, I don't know.

83
00:05:34,331 --> 00:05:37,360
I just saw them interacting right
before the wedding and you know,

84
00:05:37,361 --> 00:05:40,690
it's super stressful if you've ever gotten
married and they just seem chill and

85
00:05:41,180 --> 00:05:43,720
relaxed. So it was
like, oh good, good. Um,

86
00:05:44,680 --> 00:05:47,800
what was funny about this wedding
was there was also another bulb,

87
00:05:48,580 --> 00:05:53,320
ginger at the wedding with a red beard,
like my doppelganger.

88
00:05:53,470 --> 00:05:54,303
And um,

89
00:05:55,120 --> 00:05:59,000
I went there and I had a drink and then
I had another drink and then I was just

90
00:05:59,001 --> 00:06:01,250
like, Eh, you know, that's
good. I'm going to stop there.

91
00:06:01,251 --> 00:06:04,490
And I started drinking water.
Now on the other hand,

92
00:06:04,491 --> 00:06:06,980
the other guy was acting
like me last year.

93
00:06:07,610 --> 00:06:11,570
Well before I took four months off for
drinking and this fucking guy got fucking

94
00:06:11,571 --> 00:06:16,390
loaded, right? So I saw it was kind of
swaying in the breeze and I'm like, Ugh,

95
00:06:16,460 --> 00:06:21,260
you know, Ben there, I'm not going to
judge. He's having a good time, whatever.

96
00:06:21,261 --> 00:06:25,820
Right? So the fucking guy, next
thing I know, I'm looking outside

97
00:06:27,650 --> 00:06:31,160
and this guy,
like this wedding was so perfect,

98
00:06:31,161 --> 00:06:36,161
was in this really cool restaurant and
slash bar and so up front was the bar and

99
00:06:36,531 --> 00:06:41,531
they had these ceiling to floor windows
and the evil version of me at some point

100
00:06:44,090 --> 00:06:47,870
staggered outside and I
just felt everybody looking
and they looked and he just

101
00:06:47,900 --> 00:06:51,950
fucking puked in the street in front of
like a third of the wedding was up at

102
00:06:51,951 --> 00:06:56,120
the bar,
like a giant puddle of fucking puke.

103
00:06:57,440 --> 00:07:01,130
So all his friends rush outside and
their fucking suits to help about,

104
00:07:01,240 --> 00:07:04,580
and somebody brought a chair out.
Oh,

105
00:07:04,590 --> 00:07:07,430
they sit the guy down and
I'm not laughing at the guy,

106
00:07:07,431 --> 00:07:10,460
I'm just laughing cause I've been
there. I mean, not in a fucking,

107
00:07:10,461 --> 00:07:13,460
not have at all wedding that I was
just that looking at me. But you know,

108
00:07:13,461 --> 00:07:14,690
we've all had our moments.

109
00:07:15,980 --> 00:07:20,900
I remember one time I was somewhere
down the Cape Fucking Cape Cod joke,

110
00:07:21,530 --> 00:07:23,930
best fucking potato chips.
Um,

111
00:07:25,670 --> 00:07:30,670
I somehow passed out on a bluff that
was headed down towards the ocean.

112
00:07:33,460 --> 00:07:37,820
I was just like the middle of the day
and

113
00:07:39,320 --> 00:07:41,840
uh, I forget where my buddy
was. He was the one driving,

114
00:07:41,870 --> 00:07:46,070
he was somewhere else.
It came home,

115
00:07:46,071 --> 00:07:49,520
something happen with the car.
Um,

116
00:07:49,550 --> 00:07:53,000
and we were just passed out on like
the fucking, this, it was a bluff.

117
00:07:53,860 --> 00:07:56,780
Why I just like saying that word.
I've never used it properly.

118
00:07:58,040 --> 00:08:01,910
And all of a sudden I was laying there,
the son felt good and everything.

119
00:08:01,911 --> 00:08:04,640
I was passed out and like
it felt like a day later,

120
00:08:04,970 --> 00:08:09,620
all of a sudden they just here and
out there. That is where the Nina,

121
00:08:09,710 --> 00:08:14,710
the Pinta and it fit that in his Santa
Maria came in back in 14 fucking blah,

122
00:08:14,781 --> 00:08:18,680
blah, blah, blah, blah. And then I
had this little kid's voice go, Mommy,

123
00:08:18,681 --> 00:08:20,450
why is that guy sleeping there?

124
00:08:21,080 --> 00:08:24,620
And there was like some sort
of fucking tore going on

125
00:08:26,150 --> 00:08:26,700
and a,

126
00:08:26,700 --> 00:08:31,700
I vaguely remember changing a tire and
I didn't put the Jack Underneath the

127
00:08:32,570 --> 00:08:35,030
frame and it went and like
writing through the floorboard.

128
00:08:38,780 --> 00:08:40,940
So there you go. All right.
I'm not judging this guy,

129
00:08:40,941 --> 00:08:45,770
but it was funny as fucking hell.
So this fucking guy fucking just,

130
00:08:45,771 --> 00:08:48,710
you know, Great Lakes Yak, you know,

131
00:08:49,820 --> 00:08:51,140
puke all over the streets.

132
00:08:51,141 --> 00:08:55,860
If somebody brings a chair out and they
sit him down and he's sitting at hanging

133
00:08:55,861 --> 00:08:56,790
his head like,
you know,

134
00:08:56,791 --> 00:08:59,910
Jordan was sitting when he had the flu
and they put the towel over his head.

135
00:08:59,911 --> 00:09:02,400
He was sitting like that
minus the towel over his head.

136
00:09:02,760 --> 00:09:07,760
So then they start calling like an Uber
or Lyft and these cars keep pulling up

137
00:09:08,700 --> 00:09:13,700
and they pull up to this bald dude with
the red beard sitting with his head

138
00:09:14,581 --> 00:09:16,830
hanging down in a giant puddle of puke.

139
00:09:16,831 --> 00:09:18,690
And everybody would just pull out
and be like, yeah, it's fucking,

140
00:09:18,900 --> 00:09:22,500
guy's not getting my car. They
would drive away. And, uh,

141
00:09:22,920 --> 00:09:26,460
it just became this thing like,
do you got to move them down the street?

142
00:09:26,490 --> 00:09:30,140
You got to get them away from the puke.
And Anyway,

143
00:09:30,141 --> 00:09:32,460
somebody finally came along
and took him home. But, uh,

144
00:09:33,480 --> 00:09:37,260
he was definitely the highlight
of the evening. So, uh, I want to,

145
00:09:37,261 --> 00:09:39,540
I don't know who that guy was, but
I want to thank him for the, uh,

146
00:09:39,541 --> 00:09:43,740
the free entertainment. So anyways,
let's get back on track here.

147
00:09:43,741 --> 00:09:46,320
I'm up here in our Vancouver and uh,
as I mentioned before,

148
00:09:46,350 --> 00:09:47,290
I don't know if I mentioned,
uh,

149
00:09:47,910 --> 00:09:51,120
I was talking to a number of people
up here that listen to this podcast,

150
00:09:51,121 --> 00:09:55,230
that fly helicopters and one
of them had access to the, uh,

151
00:09:55,440 --> 00:09:59,210
Cabri g two. I hope I'm saying that
right cabaret or is it Cabrini?

152
00:09:59,370 --> 00:10:00,930
I think it's Cabri g two,

153
00:10:01,470 --> 00:10:05,880
which is basically like the Robinson
r 22 that I fly at. But it has,

154
00:10:06,960 --> 00:10:11,550
you know, any safety issues that the
Robinson may or may not have, you know,

155
00:10:11,880 --> 00:10:13,680
that it does have,

156
00:10:13,950 --> 00:10:17,700
I'm just not trying to shit on it because
I fly it all the time and I do like

157
00:10:17,701 --> 00:10:21,210
that helicopter.
These people took it to the next level.

158
00:10:21,270 --> 00:10:25,500
It's like the next iPhone, except
it didn't try to like, you know,

159
00:10:26,190 --> 00:10:29,940
capture your fucking face.
Um, it was new and improved,

160
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:34,050
so I wanted to try this thing out and um,
these people had access to it.

161
00:10:34,500 --> 00:10:37,620
So I was going to rent a car today
and his drive about an hour outside of

162
00:10:37,621 --> 00:10:41,400
Vancouver. Um, but then I got a text from
the guy who was going to fly with today.

163
00:10:41,401 --> 00:10:46,200
There's a guy here, he's a big fan of
yours. He's got a fucking, he's got a 66,

164
00:10:46,320 --> 00:10:49,470
we'll pick you up right at
the heliport downtown. I was
like, fuck it, let's do it.

165
00:10:49,830 --> 00:10:52,090
So I show up, this dude named
Chris, I want to thank him.

166
00:10:52,110 --> 00:10:56,460
Great guy picked me up to tell me all
the way out there. And I was telling him,

167
00:10:56,461 --> 00:11:00,120
he goes, so how did you get into
one of the fly? Uh, the Cabri g two?

168
00:11:00,121 --> 00:11:04,920
And I was like, well, you know, I read all
about, you know, the low, Geez, you know,

169
00:11:04,921 --> 00:11:07,980
situations, the mass bumping.
I got a little freaked out.

170
00:11:08,190 --> 00:11:09,990
Vietnam helicopter pilots.

171
00:11:10,470 --> 00:11:13,890
I just kind of feel like it's a bit of
a safety issue and they just sort of

172
00:11:13,891 --> 00:11:16,920
taught pilots how to fly out
of it rather than fix it.

173
00:11:17,700 --> 00:11:20,460
But what the fuck do I know?
I only have 160 hours. Right?

174
00:11:20,461 --> 00:11:24,300
But that was just my gut feeling.
So I want to check this thing out,

175
00:11:24,310 --> 00:11:28,890
see what the deals with this thing.
So we land at the airport and as we land,

176
00:11:28,891 --> 00:11:32,370
one of those Cabri g twos is coming in.
And I immediately loved it.

177
00:11:32,760 --> 00:11:35,340
I loved the shape of it.
And when it landed,

178
00:11:35,341 --> 00:11:40,110
seeing this little two seater with the
fully articulated main rotor system was

179
00:11:40,111 --> 00:11:44,820
like, I mean that's, that's
been the dream. Um, you know,

180
00:11:45,060 --> 00:11:48,170
cause with the our 22 you've got to
lead with the, a collective with,

181
00:11:48,171 --> 00:11:52,560
with those things, you can just push the
stick forward, which, uh, it's still,

182
00:11:52,561 --> 00:11:56,350
whenever I something like that, when the
guy just goes, okay, no, sit forward.

183
00:11:56,710 --> 00:11:59,980
I always have to make the joke that, you
know, I usually don't hear that, you know,

184
00:12:00,040 --> 00:12:02,650
flying a Robinson. So anyways, um,

185
00:12:04,390 --> 00:12:06,280
the thing lands and as it lands,

186
00:12:06,281 --> 00:12:10,770
I see this guy getting out who looks
just like the dude that I saw on the

187
00:12:10,771 --> 00:12:14,040
youtube video and it's like that the guy
who uploaded the video video that did

188
00:12:14,041 --> 00:12:14,874
the whole,

189
00:12:15,700 --> 00:12:20,080
the whole thing from nose to tail
review of it, he goes, yeah, that's him.

190
00:12:20,170 --> 00:12:23,860
And it was so surreal because I didn't
know I was going to meet this guy.

191
00:12:23,920 --> 00:12:27,610
It was like literally the guy that was
the reason that I wanted to fly it.

192
00:12:27,610 --> 00:12:31,300
I ended up not only going to his place,
I ended up getting a fly with them. Uh,

193
00:12:31,301 --> 00:12:36,220
it's BC helicopters and the guy's name
is Misha Gilb and he was incredible

194
00:12:36,221 --> 00:12:37,000
pilot.

195
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:41,740
He did an auto rotation at the end that
was just was unreal for those of you who

196
00:12:41,741 --> 00:12:46,540
fly Robinson's, there's no
watching your rpms going too high,

197
00:12:46,541 --> 00:12:47,170
too low.

198
00:12:47,170 --> 00:12:52,170
It's just he just put the collective down
and steer it and he landed this thing

199
00:12:52,780 --> 00:12:57,460
like, like, like a fucking
daisy. It was incredible. And um,

200
00:12:57,760 --> 00:12:58,660
so anyways,
he,

201
00:12:58,720 --> 00:13:02,780
he was filming the entire time
that we will outline and um,

202
00:13:02,860 --> 00:13:05,080
I was flying horribly.
I could barely even,

203
00:13:05,110 --> 00:13:07,960
I couldn't even hold a hover in the thing
because the main road had turned the

204
00:13:07,961 --> 00:13:12,670
exact opposite way. And as much as I
told myself, ignore your muscle memory,

205
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:16,090
just, Oh, you know, correct.
Whichever way the nose is going.

206
00:13:16,540 --> 00:13:20,980
And it was also super sensitive. It felt
like the sports suspension on a car,

207
00:13:21,010 --> 00:13:22,090
like a sports car,
you know?

208
00:13:23,680 --> 00:13:24,513
MMM.

209
00:13:24,610 --> 00:13:28,750
Where it was so hypersensitive that I just
kept over correcting. And then it was,

210
00:13:29,110 --> 00:13:31,750
it took me back to when
I had like under 10 hours

211
00:13:33,370 --> 00:13:37,390
flying and was just the first time trying
to hold a hover. But, uh, of course,

212
00:13:37,391 --> 00:13:40,510
by the end I got way
better than where I was at,

213
00:13:40,511 --> 00:13:42,850
but by then his GoPro had ran out.

214
00:13:42,851 --> 00:13:47,350
So you can guys can have a fun time
laughing at me flying this thing like a

215
00:13:47,351 --> 00:13:51,640
fucking salmon going up seats upstream.
It was pretty bad in the beginning, but,

216
00:13:52,060 --> 00:13:54,900
um, I really, really loved
it and I got to fly up.

217
00:13:55,090 --> 00:13:55,923
Yeah.

218
00:13:56,770 --> 00:13:58,690
You know, I mean it was definitely
a cloudy day and everything,

219
00:13:58,691 --> 00:14:01,750
but I thought it was kind of cool that
it was raining out and all that just to

220
00:14:02,010 --> 00:14:06,880
fly in something different and um,
got to go all along the,

221
00:14:07,390 --> 00:14:10,870
uh,
the whole skyline of Vancouver,

222
00:14:10,871 --> 00:14:14,350
all the way up to where all these rich
people live and shit. And then, uh,

223
00:14:14,351 --> 00:14:17,260
we flew back and on the way
back we flew up this river bed,

224
00:14:17,261 --> 00:14:20,410
which I hope he keeps that footage. That's
one of the coolest things I ever did.

225
00:14:22,070 --> 00:14:22,903
MMM.

226
00:14:23,210 --> 00:14:25,340
I felt like I was on like
the discovery channel.

227
00:14:25,341 --> 00:14:28,610
Like I should have been chasing a bunch
of gazelles or something or watching

228
00:14:28,611 --> 00:14:33,020
hippos, you know, fighting alligators
to something out on the Serengeti.

229
00:14:33,021 --> 00:14:37,430
It was amazing. And, um, we ended
up landing off airport up there.

230
00:14:37,740 --> 00:14:39,860
We landed off airport and uh,

231
00:14:40,640 --> 00:14:44,690
just some farmer's yard.
And that's when I was just like,

232
00:14:45,980 --> 00:14:49,910
I had it. The thing was all over
the place when I was flying. Um,

233
00:14:50,450 --> 00:14:53,190
but anyways, just want to thank
everybody at BC helicopters eyes.

234
00:14:53,260 --> 00:14:57,560
I had such a great time and I
will definitely be back. And uh,

235
00:14:57,590 --> 00:14:58,640
for those of you who do fly,

236
00:14:58,641 --> 00:15:01,970
if you get a chance to check out one of
those Cabri g two is a pretty fucking

237
00:15:02,030 --> 00:15:06,480
amazing. Um, and uh, and that's it.

238
00:15:06,481 --> 00:15:11,180
And then I got two more shows tonight
at the Queen Elizabeth Theater here and

239
00:15:11,690 --> 00:15:12,050
um,

240
00:15:12,050 --> 00:15:15,230
and then I immediately go back to go hang
with the family because that's the new

241
00:15:15,540 --> 00:15:19,820
me, right? I fly in the day of the Gig
and then I do the Gig the next day.

242
00:15:19,821 --> 00:15:24,320
And then I immediately leave
cause uh, I got my, you know,

243
00:15:24,470 --> 00:15:28,460
my lovely wife and my daughter,
I gotta I gotta get home too.

244
00:15:28,610 --> 00:15:31,250
So fun.
Now if I only leave for like two days,

245
00:15:31,251 --> 00:15:35,690
I don't have that much guilt where you
feel like an absent absentee father,

246
00:15:35,691 --> 00:15:39,950
you know. Um, so anyways, um,

247
00:15:41,540 --> 00:15:44,540
what time do we got here? Just 15
minutes and I should probably do this.

248
00:15:44,780 --> 00:15:48,210
Read here. Okay. Me On

second to talk about the fuck and Oscars.

270
00:17:21,170 --> 00:17:25,070
Um, congratulations to everyone who
was nominated and everybody who won,

271
00:17:25,071 --> 00:17:29,210
but in particular to people, one, I
don't know if you were paying attention,

272
00:17:29,211 --> 00:17:32,210
but two people that
won an Oscar on Monday.

273
00:17:32,240 --> 00:17:36,380
Also do a voice on the wonderful cartoon.

274
00:17:36,381 --> 00:17:37,310
F is for family.

275
00:17:38,930 --> 00:17:43,520
Allison Janney who did the voice
of our misses plasta where, uh,

276
00:17:43,521 --> 00:17:45,740
she won an Oscar for
the Tonya Harding movie.

277
00:17:45,741 --> 00:17:50,741
And then Sam Rockwell who does
the voice of a Frank's number six,

278
00:17:50,820 --> 00:17:53,200
even though he does, he's not
even aware that he's this nemesis.

279
00:17:54,090 --> 00:17:58,590
Vic Reynolds one for three billboards.
Um, so that's pretty cool. You know,

280
00:17:58,710 --> 00:18:03,450
I think that upped the ante of our show.
The status anyways

281
00:18:05,400 --> 00:18:09,900
too. I know, I'm throwing
that in. Who Does your show?
Who Do you do your show with?

282
00:18:09,930 --> 00:18:14,700
O two Oscar winners. Allison
Janney and Sam Rockwell. Right.

283
00:18:15,120 --> 00:18:19,410
Laura dern, Justin Long. Dave Kouchner.
I'm hearing I can go on forever.

284
00:18:21,360 --> 00:18:24,750
Um, by the way, I'm really loving
the, I don't want to jinx it,

285
00:18:24,751 --> 00:18:28,770
but this season three, I know
I'm teasing it early, but, uh,

286
00:18:29,130 --> 00:18:32,070
we've been laughing our asses
off in the, uh, the edit room.

287
00:18:32,880 --> 00:18:37,880
But I got to tell you yesterday I came
in landed and I was really tired because

288
00:18:38,300 --> 00:18:41,580
uh, I did a show the night before to, uh,

289
00:18:42,070 --> 00:18:45,060
for Hsas show down at the Improv and

290
00:18:46,640 --> 00:18:49,190
I had a beer or two after
at the end of the, um,

291
00:18:50,300 --> 00:18:52,400
at the end of the show and he
didn't get home til like, you know,

292
00:18:52,760 --> 00:18:55,070
one in the morning or something like that.
And then my daughter,

293
00:18:55,550 --> 00:18:59,570
my daughter gets up at like a quarter
to six, six o'clock. It's hilarious.

294
00:19:00,430 --> 00:19:01,263
Yeah,

295
00:19:02,200 --> 00:19:04,720
it just come downstairs. He can't,
you know, in that this point,

296
00:19:04,721 --> 00:19:07,420
like the reason why I drink so little
now is now I don't know what happened.

297
00:19:08,110 --> 00:19:11,290
Like if I have like, like one beer
or two beers, like the next day,

298
00:19:12,820 --> 00:19:13,653
you know,

299
00:19:14,470 --> 00:19:16,820
my daughter wakes me up and
it's just like, I feel it some

300
00:19:19,040 --> 00:19:23,330
waking up just not like hung over,
but it just feeling like less energized

301
00:19:24,900 --> 00:19:25,261
and you know,

302
00:19:25,261 --> 00:19:29,250
she's talking all this jibberish out
there and I just opened the door and the

303
00:19:29,251 --> 00:19:31,620
second I opened the door she just goes,
hi.

304
00:19:36,810 --> 00:19:39,270
I don't know if I told you is like
high as her words for everything.

305
00:19:39,960 --> 00:19:44,160
High means high, high means I want
that. Or if she wants attention,

306
00:19:44,161 --> 00:19:47,520
she does like this frantic
like hi. Hi. Hi. Hi.

307
00:19:47,550 --> 00:19:50,160
Like if she sees two people
talking and she wants to be,

308
00:19:51,390 --> 00:19:55,440
it's a really like her being like, hey,
hey, hey, hey, little help over here. Um,

309
00:19:55,441 --> 00:19:59,980
I want to get out of this
fucking chair. So, um, anyways,

310
00:19:59,981 --> 00:20:02,700
so I didn't get a lot of sleep and then
I had to go to the airport and then I

311
00:20:02,701 --> 00:20:05,730
flew up. And whenever you
fly in the plane this way,

312
00:20:05,731 --> 00:20:09,810
it's always like everybody wants to sleep
except for that one person who has the

313
00:20:09,811 --> 00:20:11,730
window open and then I can't fall asleep.

314
00:20:11,731 --> 00:20:15,460
So I get to the hotel and I'm like,
all right,

315
00:20:16,350 --> 00:20:18,420
I'm just going to lay down
here for like a half an hour.

316
00:20:19,410 --> 00:20:22,230
And I had south park on speaking of,
you know,

317
00:20:23,790 --> 00:20:27,180
animated shows, just total next
level. Absolutely fucking hilarious.

318
00:20:27,750 --> 00:20:30,840
And I was watching this episode where
Cartman had stolen a bunch of votes

319
00:20:32,610 --> 00:20:34,490
and, uh, I still,

320
00:20:34,620 --> 00:20:38,310
I fell asleep and I woke
up a little later on.

321
00:20:38,311 --> 00:20:40,200
I opened my eyes and
South Park was still on.

322
00:20:40,201 --> 00:20:43,290
I didn't realize that they
had a marathon going on,

323
00:20:43,291 --> 00:20:46,110
like they did like three or four
episodes in a row. Long story short,

324
00:20:47,260 --> 00:20:52,260
my pickup for the seven o'clock show is
at six 20 and I am asleep and all of a

325
00:20:54,041 --> 00:20:58,240
sudden the phone rings super loud in my
room and I opened my eyes is pitch black

326
00:20:58,241 --> 00:20:59,590
in the room and I was like,
oh fuck.

327
00:21:01,040 --> 00:21:02,840
And I was trying to find
my way out and I couldn't,

328
00:21:02,841 --> 00:21:06,020
I literally opened the door that
went into a closet and then verse,

329
00:21:06,230 --> 00:21:08,240
he called me and I saw it was six 30.

330
00:21:09,270 --> 00:21:09,690
Okay.

331
00:21:09,690 --> 00:21:13,560
And
I literally just threw my clothes on,

332
00:21:13,561 --> 00:21:16,560
didn't even iron my shirt,
got to the venue,

333
00:21:16,890 --> 00:21:20,070
sipped a little stroke Coty and went
out on stage. Had a great set though,

334
00:21:20,610 --> 00:21:25,140
but I was like really? A,
it was weird. I was like,

335
00:21:26,510 --> 00:21:30,440
I wasn't tired cause I slept for like
three hours. So I felt refreshed,

336
00:21:30,740 --> 00:21:34,730
but I also felt like I
just woke up. So, um,

337
00:21:36,480 --> 00:21:40,710
I dunno if the first 10 minutes the show
felt like an outer body experience, but,

338
00:21:40,860 --> 00:21:43,320
uh,
I've never slept like,

339
00:21:43,410 --> 00:21:47,850
like that close up until like almost like
missing a show or something like that.

340
00:21:47,851 --> 00:21:52,640
But, uh, fortunately, uh, you
know, it went well. I don't
know. I kind of went nowhere,

341
00:21:52,670 --> 00:21:56,930
you know, I almost missed my show, but I
didn't. And then the show went well, like,

342
00:21:56,931 --> 00:22:01,100
did I really need to fucking tell you
all of that? Was there a reason for that?

343
00:22:01,220 --> 00:22:02,930
I apologize that this recording sucks.

344
00:22:02,990 --> 00:22:07,250
I bought at an external
mic for my iPhone that, uh,

345
00:22:07,280 --> 00:22:12,040
Kevin shake the hilarious Kevin Shay
who came on my show. That's right.

346
00:22:12,110 --> 00:22:14,000
It came on the Monday morning podcast,

347
00:22:14,030 --> 00:22:17,100
promoted his special and told
me all about this. Mike going,

348
00:22:17,120 --> 00:22:18,410
I love this fucking microphone.

349
00:22:18,411 --> 00:22:21,950
I'm gonna have to talk to him about it
cause I ordered it off the Internet there

350
00:22:21,950 --> 00:22:25,880
, the inner web. And, uh, it
was only 20 bucks. I'm like,

351
00:22:25,910 --> 00:22:28,910
how the fuck is the microphone that
only cost $20 is going to be good.

352
00:22:29,040 --> 00:22:33,560
And guess what? It isn't. It fucking
sucks. So I must be using it wrong.

353
00:22:34,550 --> 00:22:37,460
Cause Kevin Shades is smart guy so he's
got to teach me how to use the fucking

354
00:22:37,461 --> 00:22:40,700
thing cause it sounds worse than if I just
hold the phone up like I am right now.

355
00:22:41,240 --> 00:22:42,440
If that makes any sense.

356
00:22:44,040 --> 00:22:44,120
Yeah.

357
00:22:44,120 --> 00:22:45,230
But anyways, I, oh my God,

358
00:22:45,231 --> 00:22:49,340
I have to tell you this fucking stupid
tee shirt that I saw and there was like

359
00:22:49,341 --> 00:22:52,250
some corporation up here, you know,
selling clothes. One of those.

360
00:22:52,990 --> 00:22:53,300
Okay,

361
00:22:53,300 --> 00:22:54,720
well I'm one of those
fucking close the place.

362
00:22:55,140 --> 00:23:00,060
And on the mannequins they have all
these fucking political tee shirts about

363
00:23:00,090 --> 00:23:01,350
equal pay for women.

364
00:23:01,590 --> 00:23:05,490
And it says like enough is enough and
something about a quality and all that.

365
00:23:05,790 --> 00:23:08,130
And it's just like I just can't like

366
00:23:09,680 --> 00:23:14,060
these fucking assholes. It's like you
were, the guy's not fucking paying people.

367
00:23:15,490 --> 00:23:19,450
Like why am I getting a fucking leg? My
voice cracking it. What the fuck are you,

368
00:23:20,830 --> 00:23:23,170
how do you get off selling
those fucking shirts?

369
00:23:25,580 --> 00:23:28,670
I don't understand why these
feminist groups don't go
in there and be like, okay,

370
00:23:28,671 --> 00:23:32,000
you're selling enough
is enough. T shirts, uh,

371
00:23:32,030 --> 00:23:35,570
why you sell and let's look into your
fucking history of paying people.

372
00:23:36,720 --> 00:23:37,080
Yeah.

373
00:23:37,080 --> 00:23:41,550
That's like this new, this new fucking
thing. What it is, is that a new thing?

374
00:23:41,551 --> 00:23:46,551
This is what people always do when a
movement happens and they get freaked out

375
00:23:46,581 --> 00:23:50,930
by what they eventually do is they
join it and once they join it,

376
00:23:50,931 --> 00:23:54,350
they have like a level of control or they
could just act like they fucking agree

377
00:23:54,351 --> 00:23:58,850
with it. So then like you don't, nobody's
looking at you like you're a problem.

378
00:23:58,851 --> 00:24:03,080
You basically, you just sort
of send it down the line
like, no problem. Here, look,

379
00:24:03,081 --> 00:24:06,980
we have a,
I'm not this enough t shirts.

380
00:24:08,270 --> 00:24:12,680
Um, I actually have an uh, an
enough is enough thing, uh,

381
00:24:13,040 --> 00:24:16,670
enough is enough as far as just
going after what guys do to women.

382
00:24:16,700 --> 00:24:20,290
How about we balanced it
out, you know, and so on.

383
00:24:20,291 --> 00:24:24,010
All this shit that fucking women
through to guys, you know, ah,

384
00:24:24,011 --> 00:24:27,550
that'll never happen. Ah, you
can't do that. If you do that,

385
00:24:27,551 --> 00:24:28,870
then you're a fucking sexist.

386
00:24:30,010 --> 00:24:35,010
We're going to fix the male female
dynamic by only examining the behavior of

387
00:24:35,141 --> 00:24:35,974
men,

388
00:24:38,740 --> 00:24:40,960
because those ladies are perfect.

389
00:24:42,100 --> 00:24:46,400
I would love to know what sweatshop
makes those enough is enough. T shirts,

390
00:24:47,230 --> 00:24:49,390
what do fuck is Michael Moore
urban lately? We'll actually,

391
00:24:49,391 --> 00:24:53,050
it's a tee shirt sold here in Canada and
God knows he blows everybody north of

392
00:24:53,051 --> 00:24:55,930
fucking Minnesota. He just
thinks that they, you know,

393
00:24:55,960 --> 00:24:59,350
like every like Canada can do no wrong
despite the fact it's one of the most

394
00:24:59,351 --> 00:25:03,760
overtly racist places I've ever
been to, um, the entire country.

395
00:25:04,090 --> 00:25:04,691
You know what I mean?

396
00:25:04,691 --> 00:25:08,170
But all you gotta do is put on a silly
hat and take some syrup out of a fucking

397
00:25:08,171 --> 00:25:11,580
tree. And then Michael Moore's just like,
oh my God, these people are amazing.

398
00:25:13,320 --> 00:25:16,350
Um, oh, pill. Why would
you do that? Why, why,

399
00:25:16,351 --> 00:25:21,180
why would you have such a nice
friendly podcast? And then,

400
00:25:21,210 --> 00:25:25,620
you know, just have to pick on, you know,
punch up bill, why can't you punch up?

401
00:25:25,800 --> 00:25:28,630
So what I've learned here about
Vancouver, uh, other than it's,

402
00:25:28,870 --> 00:25:30,120
it's beautiful and that they like,

403
00:25:30,570 --> 00:25:33,810
they like buildings that look like
the buildings that Godzilla steps on.

404
00:25:33,840 --> 00:25:38,700
I've noticed that, um, there's a lot
of, a lot of money from China here,

405
00:25:39,470 --> 00:25:41,760
you know, I don't know what
the fuck happened in China,

406
00:25:42,210 --> 00:25:46,380
but some sort of crackdown happened and
there was a bunch of rich Chinese people

407
00:25:46,500 --> 00:25:49,980
where they were just like, oh fuck, we
gotta get our money out of this country.

408
00:25:50,700 --> 00:25:54,780
And they started buying up property
along sunset strip bunch of places in the

409
00:25:54,781 --> 00:25:58,060
United States and evidently
here in Vancouver and I gotta,

410
00:25:58,080 --> 00:25:59,850
I gotta commend

411
00:26:01,740 --> 00:26:02,573
mmm.

412
00:26:03,290 --> 00:26:07,250
Chinese people with money. Those people
know where to fucking buy. You know,

413
00:26:07,580 --> 00:26:12,520
although I think Vancouver's smarter
than La with the global warming, without,

414
00:26:12,680 --> 00:26:15,860
you know, it's lush land up here
with all the water, you know,

415
00:26:16,160 --> 00:26:18,320
lakes and everything.
It's absolutely beautiful.

416
00:26:19,400 --> 00:26:21,200
Um,
I dunno,

417
00:26:23,010 --> 00:26:25,650
that must be incredible to leave
China and come to Vancouver.

418
00:26:25,651 --> 00:26:29,460
We can actually have space, but then it'd
be weird because you'd miss, you know,

419
00:26:29,461 --> 00:26:30,630
you'd miss your country.
Right.

420
00:26:31,510 --> 00:26:32,343
But,
uh,

421
00:26:33,160 --> 00:26:37,750
I know just haven't been over there how
crowded it is and how dirty the air is.

422
00:26:38,410 --> 00:26:41,200
It's got to be fucking incredible because
I think it's incredible just coming up

423
00:26:41,201 --> 00:26:44,190
from la you.
Um,

424
00:26:45,660 --> 00:26:50,250
and it was like a fucking zillion people.
All these people coming out here login,

425
00:26:50,430 --> 00:26:54,360
that Goddamn skis skiing
is fucking incredible.

426
00:26:54,361 --> 00:26:58,260
But I gotta tell you literally have
to be like your own Roadie, you know?

427
00:26:58,860 --> 00:27:01,800
And there was all these people like,
you know, you got to go snowboard man.

428
00:27:01,860 --> 00:27:03,480
You can just have that like a backpack.

429
00:27:03,570 --> 00:27:06,960
Just throw it over your fucking shoulders.
Right.

430
00:27:07,800 --> 00:27:09,960
It seems to be like I was
just sort of analyzing it,

431
00:27:09,961 --> 00:27:13,470
like skiing scares the shit out of me
cause it's like every year is some fucking

432
00:27:13,471 --> 00:27:17,010
guy around my age, jubilee, people my age,

433
00:27:18,090 --> 00:27:20,430
you know, late forties, early fifties.

434
00:27:20,431 --> 00:27:24,750
And they just come down a trail and they
hit a tree and then that's just fucking

435
00:27:24,751 --> 00:27:29,700
it. But the last time I
skied, I was in Utah and, uh,

436
00:27:29,730 --> 00:27:33,300
doing a gig out there and the comedian
I was working with wanted to go skiing.

437
00:27:33,301 --> 00:27:34,134
So we went,

438
00:27:34,140 --> 00:27:39,090
I fucking dislocated my thumb and like
nine times I thought I was going to blow

439
00:27:39,091 --> 00:27:43,590
out my niece and I vowed I would
never go again. And if I did,

440
00:27:43,591 --> 00:27:44,700
I would go snowboarding.

441
00:27:45,750 --> 00:27:50,610
I would much rather deal with a broken
tailbone or fucked up risks than a blown

442
00:27:50,611 --> 00:27:55,020
out knee. Um, you know, in my,

443
00:27:55,021 --> 00:27:59,010
if my advanced age. Um, so anyways,

444
00:28:00,530 --> 00:28:04,830
I am going to go over to the venue
right now because, uh, they allegedly,

445
00:28:04,831 --> 00:28:06,930
they got a drum kit
backstage at that place.

446
00:28:06,931 --> 00:28:10,260
So I think I'm gonna go over there and
go jam man and some fucking tunes. Good,

447
00:28:10,261 --> 00:28:14,670
clean fun. And then I'm going to
do my two shows and listen to this.

448
00:28:14,670 --> 00:28:15,420
I come home,

449
00:28:15,420 --> 00:28:20,420
I go to bed and then I have to get up
at four in the morning because I have to

450
00:28:20,821 --> 00:28:22,080
call.
Uh,

451
00:28:22,140 --> 00:28:26,850
I got a call back east cause I got a big
show coming up in Boston and I got to

452
00:28:26,851 --> 00:28:30,630
sell a bunch of tickets. So, and they
want me to come on the radio live.

453
00:28:31,710 --> 00:28:33,360
And uh,
so that's going to be my day.

454
00:28:33,361 --> 00:28:36,180
So I'm gonna wake up at four in
the fucking morning, do that shit,

455
00:28:36,240 --> 00:28:38,580
and then go to the goddamn
report and then come home.

456
00:28:39,570 --> 00:28:44,100
And my daughter's going to
be like, fucking bouncing
off the walls ready to play.

457
00:28:44,130 --> 00:28:48,030
But you know what? It's going to be
great. You know what's cool is she, uh,

458
00:28:48,450 --> 00:28:50,940
we have this doorway to our house
where it's got like, you know,

459
00:28:51,100 --> 00:28:53,580
you got the door and then along
both sides that has like these,

460
00:28:53,581 --> 00:28:56,640
those old fashioned like little windows
that go from the top all the way down to

461
00:28:56,641 --> 00:29:00,690
the bottom. So, uh, it's the greatest
thing ever when you'd come home,

462
00:29:00,691 --> 00:29:04,260
cause she's looking through smiling at
yet. But it's the worst when you leave,

463
00:29:05,040 --> 00:29:05,550
you know,

464
00:29:05,550 --> 00:29:08,100
cause she has like the saddest look
on her face because now she actually

465
00:29:08,101 --> 00:29:11,880
understands when you're leaving. So, um,

466
00:29:13,200 --> 00:29:15,330
and I got a feeling it's
only gonna get worse.

467
00:29:15,660 --> 00:29:17,400
I just don't want to get to
the point where it's like,

468
00:29:17,401 --> 00:29:21,360
I'm never want to be the point where
I leave so much that it's no big deal.

469
00:29:22,590 --> 00:29:26,010
You know, like I remember
long time ago, Danny Gans,

470
00:29:26,011 --> 00:29:31,011
the late Danny Gans told a story of how
we ended up in Vegas is his kid drew a

471
00:29:31,920 --> 00:29:36,900
family portrait and it was the mother
and all the kids. And then he goes, oh,

472
00:29:36,901 --> 00:29:38,160
that's great.
Where's Daddy?

473
00:29:38,161 --> 00:29:42,090
And then she pointed and she had drawn
an airplane and he was on the airplane

474
00:29:42,730 --> 00:29:45,970
flying away. It was like, oh, fuck. Um,

475
00:29:47,080 --> 00:29:49,690
but what am I going to deal? This is
what the fuck I do for a living. Uh,

476
00:29:49,691 --> 00:29:54,390
we also announced some dates
over, uh, two dates, um,

477
00:29:55,150 --> 00:29:59,290
one in Dublin and one in, uh, London.
And I know I got some shit from people.

478
00:29:59,291 --> 00:30:00,790
Why don't you come here?
Why don't you come there?

479
00:30:01,060 --> 00:30:05,050
I'm going to do more of an
extensive tour through Europe. Uh,

480
00:30:05,080 --> 00:30:06,550
at some point I just have to figure out,

481
00:30:06,580 --> 00:30:10,810
I got a balanced my new life
here with the waste and kid, um,

482
00:30:11,550 --> 00:30:14,440
by definitely want to get to places
that had been before in places that I've

483
00:30:14,441 --> 00:30:18,700
never been a, I just had to figure out
how to do it. But when I go to, um,

484
00:30:19,030 --> 00:30:22,780
that Dublin in London Gig,
that's,

485
00:30:22,840 --> 00:30:27,010
that's the week of my 50th birthday.
So I'm doing Dublin,

486
00:30:28,170 --> 00:30:31,390
uh, first and then I'm
doing Royal Albert Hall,

487
00:30:32,380 --> 00:30:35,830
which is insane. Then I'm going
to be there. I can't believe it.

488
00:30:36,040 --> 00:30:40,180
And that's going to be for
my 50th birthday. And uh,

489
00:30:40,210 --> 00:30:43,780
then I'm taking a week off and
I ain't going with, you know,

490
00:30:43,781 --> 00:30:46,420
my wife and kid and everything and
that's how I'm going to celebrate.

491
00:30:47,120 --> 00:30:51,520
I'm turning 50, man. What the
fuck? So I don't know. Most,

492
00:30:51,521 --> 00:30:54,100
a lot of my friends didn't make it this
far, so I'm not going to bitch about it,

493
00:30:54,101 --> 00:30:57,250
but if it's a big number.
Okay. Hey, that's some rough
one. All right. All right,

494
00:30:57,251 --> 00:30:59,080
well that's the podcast.
Thank you guys for listening.

495
00:30:59,200 --> 00:31:00,670
Thank you everybody up here in Vancouver,

496

they came up to the show last
night and are coming tonight.

497
00:31:04,240 --> 00:31:06,970
Amazing crowd last night and I think it's
going to be more of the same tonight.

498
00:31:07,510 --> 00:31:10,120
Have a great weekend yet cunts
and I'll talk to you on that.

499
00:31:54,130 --> 00:31:54,963
[inaudible] [inaudible]

500
00:32:02,550 --> 00:32:03,383
[inaudible]

501
00:32:05,580 --> 00:32:06,660
hey,
what's up everybody?

502
00:32:06,661 --> 00:32:09,990
It's bill burr and it is the
Monday morning podcast from Monday,

503
00:32:10,410 --> 00:32:14,040
March the eighth 2010 Oh my God.

504
00:32:14,041 --> 00:32:16,500
Could you believe the Oscars last night?

505
00:32:16,530 --> 00:32:21,530
I can't believe that Kelly Wigan and faith
didn't get best supporting cont for a

506
00:32:24,390 --> 00:32:28,200
let's make a fucking
Afghan in the 18 hundreds

507
00:32:31,140 --> 00:32:34,290
do you know I'm actually still in San
Jose right now and I was supposed to have

508
00:32:34,291 --> 00:32:36,450
a show tonight.
I'm actually recording this on Sunday.

509
00:32:36,451 --> 00:32:38,760
I was supposed to have a show tonight,
but it got,

510
00:32:39,590 --> 00:32:42,680
because everybody evidently is
watching the fucking Oscars.

511
00:32:44,100 --> 00:32:48,950
I can understand if you're abroad and
you want to watch that shit, I get it.

512
00:32:49,010 --> 00:32:50,360
That's like your Superbowl.

513
00:32:50,540 --> 00:32:54,980
We get to sit there and watch the
different dresses in which couple is with

514
00:32:54,981 --> 00:32:59,981
which couple and who just broke up and
are they there with their new boyfriend

515
00:33:00,081 --> 00:33:02,030
or girlfriend and oh my God.

516
00:33:02,030 --> 00:33:06,290
Did they ignore each other on the red
carpet and look at some fucking twats Yank

517
00:33:06,291 --> 00:33:09,530
back face as she talks about their shoes.
I get that.

518
00:33:09,680 --> 00:33:12,820
But where the fuck were
the men and San Jose who I,

519
00:33:13,000 --> 00:33:16,130
we had enough fucking balls left
and their relationship to be like,

520
00:33:16,131 --> 00:33:20,420
you know what? I'm not going to your
stupid fucking Oscar party. Okay.

521
00:33:20,660 --> 00:33:24,230
Cause I don't want to listen to fucking
98 different reads of Oh my God.

522
00:33:25,280 --> 00:33:29,600
You know. Oh my God, why is he
wearing that chest? Oh my God,

523
00:33:29,601 --> 00:33:32,900
she looks so beautiful.
Oh my God.

524
00:33:32,901 --> 00:33:37,130
That was like the best speech Aba.
Huh?

525
00:33:37,220 --> 00:33:39,680
Is that what you did? He's sitting
in a cubicle right now as a man.

526
00:33:39,800 --> 00:33:41,480
Is that what you did last night?
Cause if he did,

527
00:33:41,630 --> 00:33:46,430
he should be hanging in your
fucking head. Huh? What happened?

528
00:33:46,490 --> 00:33:48,890
Let's go down memory lane.
Okay,

529
00:33:49,220 --> 00:33:52,040
go all the way back to high school when
you're still at a set of balls between

530
00:33:52,041 --> 00:33:55,280
your fucking legs. Remember that they
were brand new and they were ready to go.

531
00:33:55,390 --> 00:33:58,730
I've got a question for you. Where the
fuck did they go? Cause you different,

532
00:33:58,731 --> 00:33:59,930
you definitely didn't have them.

533
00:34:00,080 --> 00:34:04,940
Men of San Jose because you weren't at
my fucking show last night to the point

534
00:34:04,941 --> 00:34:08,660
it had to be canceled.
Granted, I'm not going to lie.

535
00:34:08,690 --> 00:34:12,200
About a fucking month and a half ago,
a married couple came out of a bar,

536
00:34:12,201 --> 00:34:13,380
got into with the Bouncer,

537
00:34:13,400 --> 00:34:17,300
cops showed up and he fucking tased
the dude's wife and shot the guy in the

538
00:34:17,301 --> 00:34:20,840
abdomen. And the dude damn near bled
out right in front of the Improv here.

539
00:34:22,190 --> 00:34:25,430
Look it up online. They got the picture.
You know, after there's a shooting,

540
00:34:25,431 --> 00:34:26,450
they clean up the mess.

541
00:34:26,630 --> 00:34:31,100
There's always the fucking old ketchup
stains on the sidewalk and a couple of

542
00:34:31,400 --> 00:34:35,120
articles of clothing and it's
fucking hilarious. And then right,

543
00:34:35,150 --> 00:34:39,230
right next to it they had the marquee
and it still said Eddie Griffin.

544
00:34:44,940 --> 00:34:49,770
It was funny. So yeah, I guess that
isn't good for fucking business. But, um,

545
00:34:49,890 --> 00:34:50,701
I gotta tell you,
man,

546
00:34:50,701 --> 00:34:55,380
I had a great time coming up here and
I've avoided coming to San Jose because I

547
00:34:55,381 --> 00:34:57,900
was worried that, uh, basically
what happened Sunday night,

548
00:34:57,901 --> 00:35:01,110
I thought it was going to happen all
week because I don't know what is about

549
00:35:01,111 --> 00:35:04,980
California. I just feel like if you're
not, if you're not a fucking Latino comic,

550
00:35:06,150 --> 00:35:08,310
you know,
I just don't or are super famous.

551
00:35:09,240 --> 00:35:11,580
You're not gonna sell any
tickets out here. Cause you know,

552
00:35:11,730 --> 00:35:15,390
people put that in my head. Um, but no,

553
00:35:15,391 --> 00:35:18,900
a lot of people came out on a Saturday
night and they actually had a balcony.

554
00:35:19,410 --> 00:35:24,210
That was the thing about on Friday,
nobody showed up. Right. So there I am.

555
00:35:24,211 --> 00:35:29,070
I'm standing in this huge fucking theater
in the entire upper deck is empty.

556
00:35:29,071 --> 00:35:31,800
I felt like I was performing at
a fucking royals game. You know,

557
00:35:32,550 --> 00:35:35,070
I felt like I should've been like singing
the national anthem or something like

558
00:35:35,071 --> 00:35:38,940
that and then yelling at
my manager wondering what
happened to my fucking music

559
00:35:38,941 --> 00:35:42,240
career that I couldn't at least
sing it like an angel's game.

560
00:35:42,980 --> 00:35:45,910
All those fucking idiots gotta come out
there with their, they have their deck,

561
00:35:46,320 --> 00:35:48,660
goddamn noise makers.
How lame are you,

562
00:35:48,900 --> 00:35:52,170
his fans that the ownership is
basically saying, you know what?

563
00:35:52,530 --> 00:35:56,560
You guys have such a lack of
passion. We need them. We need to,

564
00:35:56,590 --> 00:36:00,990
to invent something to make it sound like
you guys care way more than you really

565
00:36:00,991 --> 00:36:02,160
do here.

566
00:36:02,340 --> 00:36:06,330
Here's a couple inflatable
fucking plastic balloons.

567
00:36:06,630 --> 00:36:11,610
Just slam them together. We'll even get a
monkey. I have a crazy monkey out there.

568
00:36:12,810 --> 00:36:17,010
Fucking angels. Um, anyways,

569
00:36:18,400 --> 00:36:21,080
what am I doing here? What the fuck
am I talking about? Um, I actually,

570
00:36:21,110 --> 00:36:23,520
I had a great weekend and uh,
believe it or not,

571
00:36:23,521 --> 00:36:26,150
you wouldn't know it from my voice and
I found a great Sushi place out here at

572
00:36:26,470 --> 00:36:29,880
checkout. Smile. Susi Sushi.
If you get a chance to,

573
00:36:30,120 --> 00:36:33,840
I don't know where the fuck it is, but
you have the Internet, right? Let me,

574
00:36:33,841 --> 00:36:36,270
I'm fucking walking around right now.
I'm looking out the window.

575
00:36:36,570 --> 00:36:39,840
They got a museum across the street
and they have a star trek exhibition.

576
00:36:40,020 --> 00:36:41,940
And you should have seen
these fucking nerds.

577
00:36:42,300 --> 00:36:45,360
You should have seen these
fucking nerds just, just,

578
00:36:46,050 --> 00:36:50,130
just standing outside,
like waiting for a museum to open.

579
00:36:50,280 --> 00:36:54,330
That's when you know you're a fucking
nerd. Okay. Everybody's gone to museum.

580
00:36:54,450 --> 00:36:59,310
But who the fuck has ever stood outside
of museum with your face pressed against

581
00:36:59,311 --> 00:37:02,790
the glass,
waiting for the fucking thing to open up.

582
00:37:03,960 --> 00:37:08,760
You know, Jesus cry. I mean, I I
see back in the day you're what?

583
00:37:08,761 --> 00:37:12,600
You're waiting for fucking concert
tickets. You know what I mean?

584
00:37:12,690 --> 00:37:16,440
Back in the day when they used to have
like actually have record stores and the

585
00:37:16,441 --> 00:37:20,610
artists would come through and you'd be
standing outside strawberries records

586
00:37:20,611 --> 00:37:25,410
and tapes, you know, waiting to have
your cassette signed by Brian Adams.

587
00:37:27,540 --> 00:37:29,250
What did I pick? Bryan
Adams. I'll tell you why.

588
00:37:29,251 --> 00:37:33,840
Because I am staying at a very nice hotel
as I've made it to that level in this

589
00:37:33,841 --> 00:37:37,290
business. All right. I
am on the 14th floor,

590
00:37:37,350 --> 00:37:40,890
the Penthouse fucking level.
Although I just have a suite.

591
00:37:40,950 --> 00:37:45,840
I haven't gotten to that level yet
and I'm looking out the barren fucking

592
00:37:45,841 --> 00:37:49,590
landscape here as far as
people go. Anyways. Um,

593
00:37:51,780 --> 00:37:52,261
but anyways,

594
00:37:52,261 --> 00:37:56,040
I went down to the fucking place to have
breakfast in the second I walked in.

595
00:37:56,041 --> 00:38:00,390
Right. All I see is his cloth
napkins in leather bound menus.

596
00:38:00,510 --> 00:38:03,840
So right there, you know, it's going
to be like 58 bucks for an Omelette.

597
00:38:03,841 --> 00:38:08,610
So all I want to do is stop and turn
around and get the fuck out of the place.

598
00:38:08,670 --> 00:38:11,070
But do I, of course I don't. You know why?

599
00:38:11,071 --> 00:38:14,850
Because there's so few people in there
that everybody looked at me when I came

600
00:38:14,851 --> 00:38:18,240
in and it reminded me of this time
when I went to this titty bar in Troy,

601
00:38:18,241 --> 00:38:20,100
New York,
I believe it was Troy,

602
00:38:20,101 --> 00:38:22,740
New York was called the cloud
night and he perverts out there.

603
00:38:22,800 --> 00:38:24,460
You know what the fuck I'm talking about.
It's not really,

604
00:38:24,750 --> 00:38:28,260
it's sort of a strip club,
sort of a guy's house.

605
00:38:28,980 --> 00:38:30,300
I would have to describe it as,

606
00:38:30,301 --> 00:38:33,210
I just remember there was an upstairs
when he came walking in that literally

607
00:38:33,211 --> 00:38:37,250
look like some old lady should it down
in her house coat and just be like,

608
00:38:37,270 --> 00:38:42,100
all right, can you, can you stop all
that strapping? I'm trying to sleep. Um,

609
00:38:43,240 --> 00:38:47,200
and then some sort of double wide trailer
that's sold videos that was attached

610
00:38:47,201 --> 00:38:49,300
to the other side of it. But
anyways, long story short,

611
00:38:49,570 --> 00:38:51,940
I went in there with two other
people who will remain nameless,

612
00:38:52,090 --> 00:38:56,230
cause I don't name names in the fucking
podcast because I'm old school. Um,

613
00:38:56,840 --> 00:38:58,720
so I can't even fucking
remember who they are. Anyways,

614
00:38:58,721 --> 00:39:01,420
I've talked to my cell phone
so fucking much. So anyways,

615
00:39:01,421 --> 00:39:04,780
I walk into the goddamn place,
we all walk in and the second we walk in,

616
00:39:04,781 --> 00:39:06,490
all we want to do is
turn around and walk out.

617
00:39:06,670 --> 00:39:10,720
But there's so few fucking
people in there. Everybody's
looking at us, the dancer,

618
00:39:10,900 --> 00:39:13,900
the fucking Dj, the fucking, uh,

619
00:39:13,930 --> 00:39:17,440
porky guy who runs the goddamn
place and the two fucking, uh,

620
00:39:17,770 --> 00:39:21,740
immigrant truckers who was sitting in
there, I believe they will Yugoslavian.

621
00:39:21,760 --> 00:39:24,730
I can't remember what. So, you know,
you just fucking go in and sit down.

622
00:39:24,731 --> 00:39:27,340
So I went in and I sat down at
this fucking breakfast place.

623
00:39:27,490 --> 00:39:30,400
I'm back to the breakfast
place or I try to keep up.

624
00:39:31,570 --> 00:39:33,900
I'm playing these fucking brain
games on the Internet. All right.

625
00:39:33,910 --> 00:39:38,620
My fucking brain is sharp.
It's coming back. Um, got,

626
00:39:38,710 --> 00:39:41,020
I'm lonely. Anyways. Um,

627
00:39:42,280 --> 00:39:45,190
so I sit down at this fucking
breakfast place and uh,

628
00:39:46,060 --> 00:39:49,540
there's this a medium size woman
who suffers from vocal fry.

629
00:39:49,630 --> 00:39:52,540
And for those of you who didn't major in
communications and didn't have to take

630
00:39:52,541 --> 00:39:56,700
a career speech class,
vocal fry is basically, uh,

631
00:39:56,740 --> 00:39:58,360
a way of speaking where you're not,

632
00:39:58,930 --> 00:40:02,560
you're not forcing enough air
through your vocal chords.

633
00:40:02,890 --> 00:40:06,150
So you start your talk like this.
Have you ever,

634
00:40:06,160 --> 00:40:08,230
you ever heard people talk like that?
Oh my God,

635
00:40:08,231 --> 00:40:12,160
I was up at Amy's house the other day
and I just felt like she was giving me

636
00:40:12,161 --> 00:40:17,070
this vibe. Or you have the
other people who start off
where they, they, they, they,

637
00:40:17,071 --> 00:40:20,050
they, they push enough air
through their vocal cords,

638
00:40:20,051 --> 00:40:23,110
but then towards the end
they, they, they taper off.

639
00:40:24,250 --> 00:40:29,190
Today everyone, we're going to be
reading about a lady who, yeah, blah,

640
00:40:29,630 --> 00:40:33,400
blah, blah, blah, blah. Bababa mad
at that fucking drives you nuts.

641
00:40:34,030 --> 00:40:37,330
And never used to bug me until I took a
class on it. Now I can't stop hearing.

642
00:40:37,331 --> 00:40:42,331
So this fucking idiot is sitting
there talking like the typical,

643
00:40:43,031 --> 00:40:46,300
like, I dunno, she
sounded very intelligent,

644
00:40:46,301 --> 00:40:49,270
but all she was talking about
was like us magazine Shit.

645
00:40:49,810 --> 00:40:54,810
And meanwhile I was listening
to a instrumental of a
Brian Adams song over the

646
00:40:55,601 --> 00:40:58,590
fucking radio,
you know,

647
00:40:58,720 --> 00:41:02,470
and Brian and his first came out and
he had the Fonzi leather jacket. Right.

648
00:41:02,530 --> 00:41:06,430
And you're like, wow, this guy's good.
He's got some decent tunes, you know.

649
00:41:07,020 --> 00:41:10,690
Got My first meal, 60, remember
that? And when he was so young,

650
00:41:10,691 --> 00:41:13,540
you thought that that actually rocked,
but it wasn't bad for pub.

651
00:41:13,810 --> 00:41:17,470
And then he just fucking jumped the shark
where it's just like, you know what?

652
00:41:18,400 --> 00:41:21,250
I can't fucking do this anymore.
My face is breaking out.

653
00:41:21,670 --> 00:41:24,010
I can't fucking do it anymore.
I'm just going to sell out.

654
00:41:24,250 --> 00:41:27,880
I want to write a song for chicks.
Richard Marx can do it. So can I,

655
00:41:28,120 --> 00:41:29,270
and then he had that song.
Yeah.

656
00:41:29,380 --> 00:41:30,213
Okay.

657
00:41:34,490 --> 00:41:35,323
[inaudible]

658
00:41:35,630 --> 00:41:36,700
it up.

659
00:41:39,520 --> 00:41:43,620
[inaudible] that song I chair.
Yeah, that stupid fucking song.

660
00:41:43,770 --> 00:41:47,370
They used to make receptionist tear up
all across this country when it would

661
00:41:47,371 --> 00:41:50,550
come on and a dental office.
Um,

662
00:41:50,610 --> 00:41:55,170
they had an instrumental version of that
going on as I ate my fucking scrambled

663
00:41:55,171 --> 00:41:56,640
eggs and listen to this fat fuck.

664
00:41:56,641 --> 00:42:00,000
Talk about little house on
the prairie with vocal fry.

665
00:42:01,380 --> 00:42:04,410
So that was probably the low
point of the weekend. Um,

666
00:42:04,860 --> 00:42:06,930
I don't even know what I'm talking about.
You know what I did want to hype.

667
00:42:07,890 --> 00:42:10,350
I want it to hype. Jesus Christ.
That was only 10 minutes.

668
00:42:10,470 --> 00:42:11,940
There's no fucking way
I'm making this one.

669
00:42:12,480 --> 00:42:16,950
This one's going to be short and
sweet everybody or shortened mediocre,

670
00:42:17,100 --> 00:42:20,310
however you want to fucking call it.
Let's hit the refresh. Pray page.

671
00:42:20,700 --> 00:42:23,760
Let's see how the Bruins and the penguins
are doing. Bruins need to win this one.

672
00:42:24,350 --> 00:42:27,180
Got To make sure we make the playoffs so
we can fucking lose in the first round.

673
00:42:27,181 --> 00:42:31,710
Still one to one. After two
periods, two friends of mine,

674
00:42:31,711 --> 00:42:36,130
Billy Gardell and Randy Bowman
or Bauman are at the, uh,

675
00:42:36,200 --> 00:42:37,560
at the penguins game right now.

676
00:42:38,280 --> 00:42:41,010
Randy Bowman from a Jim and
Randy showed WTV in Pittsburgh.

677
00:42:41,640 --> 00:42:45,990
Have a fucking listen. They're sitting
there talking shit, texting me,

678
00:42:45,991 --> 00:42:48,270
talking shit.
You know,

679
00:42:48,600 --> 00:42:51,720
right before the game about how the
penguins were going to kill the Bruins.

680
00:42:51,721 --> 00:42:56,550
You know, we're having an off year and
lo and behold, you know, an hour goes by,

681
00:42:56,610 --> 00:42:57,810
there's no shit talking.

682
00:42:57,960 --> 00:43:01,410
So I go on the Internet and there it is
zero zero after the first fucking period

683
00:43:02,730 --> 00:43:04,410
fucking asshole penguin.
So you know,

684
00:43:04,700 --> 00:43:08,070
Harry sending of the Bruins was actually
debating suing the Pittsburgh Penguins

685
00:43:08,071 --> 00:43:12,090
when they switched to black and
gold for stealing the Bruins colors.

686
00:43:13,140 --> 00:43:16,050
You know, I'm going to pause here and
let the people in Pittsburgh exhale

687
00:43:16,130 --> 00:43:19,490
be like, hey, look at Pittsburgh
Steelers. You tried to do too.

688
00:43:19,990 --> 00:43:24,250
Ruins had been around since before the
fucking stealers and the Steelers back in

689
00:43:24,251 --> 00:43:26,980
the day used to basically
have yellow uniforms.

690
00:43:27,080 --> 00:43:30,370
They're that big stupid yellow helmet.
That's what they had. All right.

691
00:43:30,460 --> 00:43:32,890
And the only black you had was
a couple of little stripes.

692
00:43:33,160 --> 00:43:36,970
That's all it was back then.
When you play the old 23 skidoo the long,

693
00:43:37,000 --> 00:43:41,080
I say the long pass when you were doing
that shit. So I don't want to hear it.

694
00:43:42,490 --> 00:43:44,060
Um, and plus, you know what I mean? Who,

695
00:43:44,100 --> 00:43:48,640
who fuck takes the exact same colors
as another team in the same league.

696
00:43:49,060 --> 00:43:53,260
Okay. You started off with your gay little
baby blue fucking penguin. You know,

697
00:43:53,261 --> 00:43:56,980
first of all your penguins.
Why am I talking? Shit,

698
00:43:57,450 --> 00:43:59,500
I'm going to get hit with the
obvious one was the last time.

699
00:43:59,501 --> 00:44:04,270
You guys want a cup 19 here. We need to
then shut the fuck up bill. Fine. I will.

700
00:44:04,900 --> 00:44:08,620
All right. You just keep joy.
That fucking whiny pussy.

701
00:44:09,640 --> 00:44:11,290
He's not a pussy,
but have you ever seen,

702
00:44:11,320 --> 00:44:14,680
I haven't seen anybody wine the way
Cindy Crosby wine since fucking,

703
00:44:14,920 --> 00:44:18,450
he's like Danny Ainge on skates pow,
pow goes,

704
00:44:18,451 --> 00:44:23,451
saw played fucking hockey and was a
good looking guy with full ruby red lips

705
00:44:24,071 --> 00:44:28,850
from Nova Scotia.
All right,

706
00:44:28,870 --> 00:44:30,940
so whatever,
let's hit refresh again.

707
00:44:30,941 --> 00:44:33,780
Do at least make the end of the
fucking period here. Come on. Berlin's.

708
00:44:34,470 --> 00:44:36,390
There we go. The end of two. One to one.

709
00:44:36,391 --> 00:44:38,310
What do you guys say now
they have Billy Gardell

710
00:44:40,380 --> 00:44:44,570
fucking cock sucker. All right. Um,
what was I trying to say here? Um,

711
00:44:46,110 --> 00:44:47,850
oh, I know I wanted to hype is, uh,

712
00:44:48,960 --> 00:44:53,860
one of the fans here on the podcast
who will also remain nameless, um,

713
00:44:55,190 --> 00:44:57,870
has started a fan page for the
Monday morning podcast. Okay.

714
00:44:57,871 --> 00:45:02,100
So I'm actually going to the
next level with this podcast. Um,

715
00:45:02,370 --> 00:45:06,810
a lot of times I make references
and uh, you know, people, you know,

716
00:45:06,811 --> 00:45:09,030
don't have time to look them up or
maybe you don't want to go all over the

717
00:45:09,031 --> 00:45:11,460
internet trying to figure out
what the fuck I'm talking about.

718
00:45:11,790 --> 00:45:15,990
This guy has a bunch of uh, you know,
has links to some of the references. He,

719
00:45:15,991 --> 00:45:18,690
you know,
does all that Photoshop stuff.

720
00:45:18,840 --> 00:45:21,450
He does all that computer stuff
that I don't know how to describe.

721
00:45:21,990 --> 00:45:25,290
But basically if you'd like to check it
out at the end of the podcast or maybe

722
00:45:25,500 --> 00:45:28,860
follow along,
you can go to a page called

723
00:45:33,600 --> 00:45:38,600
www.themmpodcast.com www.themmpodcast.com.

724
00:45:39,511 --> 00:45:44,160
No spaces. Okay. And now you go,
I'm hyping that for the week.

725
00:45:45,780 --> 00:45:48,150
Um, see, this is why I
don't hype Shit. Now I just,

726
00:45:48,151 --> 00:45:52,020
whatever flow I just fucking
head is out the goddamn window.

727
00:45:52,950 --> 00:45:53,880
What else did I do here?

728
00:45:53,881 --> 00:45:56,970
You know what I like about San Jose
is it is actually a hockey town.

729
00:45:57,570 --> 00:45:58,920
Like I'm in my hotel,

730
00:45:58,921 --> 00:46:02,940
they have the NHL Channel and I was
sitting there watching hockey night in

731
00:46:02,941 --> 00:46:07,040
Canada, which is Saturday
night. Um, and I,

732
00:46:07,050 --> 00:46:08,070
what the fuck was I watching?

733
00:46:08,071 --> 00:46:11,100
I was watching Toronto verus Ottawa
and a that had to go do my show.

734
00:46:11,101 --> 00:46:12,380
But coming up they had a,

735
00:46:13,380 --> 00:46:17,150
the La kings verse to Canadians with
any luck, they fucking beat him.

736
00:46:18,250 --> 00:46:21,000
Did they beat him? You know
what? I'm going to check.

737
00:46:21,030 --> 00:46:24,990
God knows I've got nothing else to talk
about on this fucking podcast. Um, no.

738
00:46:24,991 --> 00:46:25,824
You know what,

739
00:46:26,280 --> 00:46:29,310
let's continue this sports theme just
so we can get rid of all the people who

740
00:46:29,311 --> 00:46:32,700
aren't into sports and are into
other things like politics.

741
00:46:33,390 --> 00:46:37,800
The fuck is up with that once the
deal with people who are informed. Um,

742
00:46:38,340 --> 00:46:43,050
on a number of weeks ago, I actually,
I ripped Peyton manning a new asshole.

743
00:46:43,051 --> 00:46:44,730
And upon listening back to it,
you know,

744
00:46:44,760 --> 00:46:48,240
I actually sounded like half of fucking
retard. I will definitely admit that.

745
00:46:48,241 --> 00:46:52,830
But I still stand by my opinions and I
kept bringing up a guy by the name of

746
00:46:52,831 --> 00:46:56,700
Terry Bradshaw who has four
Superbowl rings and uh, you know,

747
00:46:56,701 --> 00:47:00,180
everybody hit me dude. The only two
from like 20 plank, I can fucking huge.

748
00:47:00,600 --> 00:47:05,100
Well they have a great article on Terry
Bradshaw in a sporting news magazine

749
00:47:06,510 --> 00:47:10,740
this week or this month. I don't
really read this magazine, but I'm,

750
00:47:11,220 --> 00:47:15,210
that kid from Nebraska
was on the cover that uh,

751
00:47:15,240 --> 00:47:20,070
Dima Dima Tamu Kong, Su Damo Kong sue.

752
00:47:20,100 --> 00:47:23,970
I don't know.
He's got a great fucking name and uh,

753
00:47:24,150 --> 00:47:25,860
the Patriots needed defensive tackle,

754
00:47:25,861 --> 00:47:28,020
but I know we're not going to
draft high enough to get that guy.

755
00:47:28,021 --> 00:47:29,070
But I just wanted to read about,

756
00:47:29,320 --> 00:47:31,720
cause I figured maybe they talk about
other defensive tackles that were

757
00:47:31,721 --> 00:47:35,110
available because I have
no life. Um, but anyways,

758
00:47:35,111 --> 00:47:38,380
I opened it up and Lo and behold, there
was a great article about Terry Bradshaw,

759
00:47:38,381 --> 00:47:42,430
which basically backs up what the fuck I
was talking about. At least in my world.

760
00:47:42,431 --> 00:47:44,010
It does.
And uh,

761
00:47:44,130 --> 00:47:49,030
and they mentioned right in the beginning
it said a Bradshaw won his fourth and

762
00:47:49,031 --> 00:47:53,080
final Superbowl ring with
an MVP performance for the
Steelers at the rose bowl

763
00:47:53,290 --> 00:47:54,400
among quarterbacks.

764
00:47:54,401 --> 00:47:59,401
Only Joe Montana has that record and it's
quite possibly none will ever surpass

765
00:48:00,701 --> 00:48:04,660
it. Okay. All you Peyton
manning fans out there,

766
00:48:04,780 --> 00:48:09,400
do you think he's going to get five
fucking rings? They'll get four.

767
00:48:10,150 --> 00:48:14,860
I think he could possibly get three.
He's not getting four though. All right.

768
00:48:15,280 --> 00:48:19,870
And this is coming from fucking Terry
Bradshaw, a man who played the game.

769
00:48:19,900 --> 00:48:21,610
This is what,
this is a quote from the article.

770
00:48:21,611 --> 00:48:25,150
The only thing that matters in the
prose is winning the Superbowl.

771
00:48:25,270 --> 00:48:28,570
I've never had anyone come up to
me in my life and say, hey Terri,

772
00:48:28,720 --> 00:48:32,560
how many yards did you throw? Four.
How many touchdown passes do you have?

773
00:48:32,561 --> 00:48:35,950
It's all about rinks.
Does that sound familiar?

774
00:48:37,090 --> 00:48:40,540
Go listen to the fucking
February 8th podcast.

775
00:48:41,740 --> 00:48:46,130
Maybe Terry listens to my podcast.
Oh, fucking arrogant. Is that? Um,

776
00:48:46,150 --> 00:48:48,910
but then he says, uh, he says
it's all about rings, but dude,

777
00:48:49,340 --> 00:48:51,700
the shit that this guy took,
you know,

778
00:48:51,701 --> 00:48:55,330
I knew in the beginning of his career
that this guy had a rough time in

779
00:48:55,331 --> 00:49:00,010
Pittsburgh and everybody,
you know, basically treated
him like a dumb redneck and,

780
00:49:00,340 --> 00:49:02,660
uh, kind of like what they
did with John Rocker. Oh,

781
00:49:02,890 --> 00:49:07,030
always fought John rocker got a bum deal
because I was living in New York and

782
00:49:07,031 --> 00:49:10,810
they were basically calling
this guy a fucking moron,

783
00:49:10,811 --> 00:49:13,150
redneck and not so many words.

784
00:49:13,420 --> 00:49:17,500
And then he comes out and
starts trash in New York.

785
00:49:17,710 --> 00:49:20,800
And then typical media,
they get to step away.

786
00:49:21,130 --> 00:49:23,560
Like they didn't insight any of it,
you know,

787
00:49:23,920 --> 00:49:27,580
and all the mets fans get to act like
they weren't fucking yelling shit at him.

788
00:49:27,760 --> 00:49:29,860
I used to be doing a bit
about that. That, uh,

789
00:49:31,950 --> 00:49:36,280
that of the punchline was basically
you had date rapists and wife beaters

790
00:49:36,370 --> 00:49:39,190
throwing batteries at a bigot.
That was basically,

791
00:49:39,250 --> 00:49:42,820
that was my little fucking social
commentary on the John Rocker incident.

792
00:49:43,030 --> 00:49:45,760
Let me get back to this shit
and not supporting anything
that John Rock has said,

793
00:49:45,761 --> 00:49:47,980
but you know what I mean?
It's like, you know,

794
00:49:47,981 --> 00:49:51,610
if you're going to FAU fucking
throw rocks, rocks at a,
at a, at a Hornet's nest.

795
00:49:53,320 --> 00:49:57,400
Yeah. Yeah. I don't know. Dad did I
almost just say you're going to get stung.

796
00:49:57,550 --> 00:49:58,780
You know what I almost just created,

797
00:49:58,781 --> 00:50:03,100
there was one of those southern fucking
expressions that I love so much faster

798
00:50:03,101 --> 00:50:06,850
and Turkey shit through a tin horn.
I'll tell you that boy,

799
00:50:06,940 --> 00:50:09,490
that boy fuck a rock up.
You thought a snake was under it.

800
00:50:10,900 --> 00:50:14,110
Anybody from down south can just send
me a whole list of those fucking things.

801
00:50:14,200 --> 00:50:16,480
If I already done this on the
podcast and I don't remember,

802
00:50:16,780 --> 00:50:21,040
I absolutely love those fucking
expressions that Boyd fuck mud.

803
00:50:25,480 --> 00:50:26,710
I don't even know what they mean.

804
00:50:27,800 --> 00:50:30,620
That boy would fuck a rock if he
thought his snake was under it.

805
00:50:30,621 --> 00:50:34,220
How does that make any sense? But,
but, but when I love about is,

806
00:50:34,221 --> 00:50:35,960
even though it doesn't make sense,
you,

807
00:50:36,100 --> 00:50:40,040
you understand what the person is
saying and there's a genius to that.

808
00:50:40,490 --> 00:50:45,320
So anyways, um, let me, uh, let, let's
read about Terry Bradshaw's Er, er,

809
00:50:45,470 --> 00:50:49,070
the early part of his fucking
career basically. Yeah, they were,

810
00:50:49,100 --> 00:50:51,620
they were shitting all over it. Well,
why don't we have Terry it here.

811
00:50:52,100 --> 00:50:54,950
You said you have to understand something.
My first five years were not the best.

812
00:50:55,220 --> 00:50:58,490
I had shit thrown in my face.
I was booed, criticized,

813
00:50:58,790 --> 00:51:01,490
called stupid and dumb
players talking about,

814
00:51:01,520 --> 00:51:06,020
we're saying this is players on his teams
were saying, ah, we win. In spite of him,

815
00:51:06,290 --> 00:51:10,460
he stutters in the huddle.
I had so much of that shit thrown at me.

816
00:51:10,460 --> 00:51:12,620
I got bitter about it.
And my coach,

817
00:51:12,890 --> 00:51:17,330
who I thought never defended me in
public chuck, no. Um, the thing was,

818
00:51:17,331 --> 00:51:18,680
I was never his chosen one.

819
00:51:18,681 --> 00:51:21,860
I had to sit back and come to grips with
all that and it was very painful for me.

820
00:51:21,980 --> 00:51:23,480
It wasn't a storybook career.

821
00:51:23,660 --> 00:51:27,410
So I take a great deal of pride and being
the quarterback of the team that won

822
00:51:27,411 --> 00:51:30,350
all those super bowls. Yeah. And the
guy never gets to fucking respect.

823
00:51:30,620 --> 00:51:33,560
Do you know before Superbowl 13?
Uh,

824
00:51:33,620 --> 00:51:38,540
Thomas Hollywood Henderson said Terry
Bradshaw couldn't spell cat if you spotted

825
00:51:38,541 --> 00:51:39,770
them to see in the a.

826
00:51:40,310 --> 00:51:43,850
So they asked Bradshaw about this
and if you watch football, you know,

827
00:51:43,851 --> 00:51:46,910
we always comes off like this guy just
being all silly and joking around,

828
00:51:46,911 --> 00:51:48,980
but he goes, well, it tick me off.

829
00:51:49,490 --> 00:51:51,890
The thing that ticked me
off was nobody defended me.

830
00:51:52,130 --> 00:51:56,480
Who came out on my team and
said, bullshit. He calls
the place, he sets it up.

831
00:51:56,481 --> 00:52:00,380
Who defended me? Chuck Noll didn't,
didn't defend me. The only guy knows,

832
00:52:00,381 --> 00:52:01,820
said something was Joe Greene.

833
00:52:02,180 --> 00:52:04,870
And then here I got to deal with
this thing going into the Superbowl.

834
00:52:04,970 --> 00:52:05,960
What the hell am I going to do?

835
00:52:05,961 --> 00:52:08,990
I'm smart enough to know not to get in
that argument with Hollywood Henderson

836
00:52:09,260 --> 00:52:13,730
through the media because
it's a distraction. Um, I
don't have time for that shit.

837
00:52:13,760 --> 00:52:18,020
Okay. So I can't spell cat. If
you spot me the c and the t, uh,

838
00:52:18,021 --> 00:52:21,530
that's some good shit. Congratulations.
Then you go out and you kicked our asses.

839
00:52:21,800 --> 00:52:25,430
How much? How's my spelling look now
you're the one who had to go to prison.

840
00:52:29,840 --> 00:52:33,790
Hey, chuck it there. Terry's an angry
mother fucker or whatever. I love it.

841
00:52:34,270 --> 00:52:36,910
I love it. You know, something that
he never went back to Pittsburgh.

842
00:52:37,540 --> 00:52:39,940
I didn't even notice that shit
when he was done. He just left.

843
00:52:39,941 --> 00:52:42,910
He doesn't even talk to any of the
players. And he said, he goes, I mean,

844
00:52:42,911 --> 00:52:46,030
it's kind of a failure of my personality.
I don't know.

845
00:52:46,031 --> 00:52:50,200
It's a really interesting article
because if you watch him on a,

846
00:52:50,650 --> 00:52:54,490
whatever the hell this show is called,
the NFL pregame, he still plays it up.

847
00:52:54,491 --> 00:52:58,120
Like he says, you know, this, this just,
just this country boy. But he isn't,

848
00:52:58,150 --> 00:53:00,760
he's fucking sharp as attack.
And uh,

849
00:53:00,761 --> 00:53:03,520
he didn't like the way he was treated
in Pittsburgh. And I enjoy that.

850
00:53:04,150 --> 00:53:06,190
I enjoy that considering those guys,
uh,

851
00:53:06,270 --> 00:53:09,880
how seriously they take their team and
their fucking quarterback at game four

852
00:53:10,230 --> 00:53:14,980
super bowls. He treated them like
such shit. You know, I just like,

853
00:53:15,010 --> 00:53:19,960
I like when teams do that to their
fucking players cause it makes Boston fans

854
00:53:19,961 --> 00:53:22,660
look better cause God knows where
bunch of fucking assholes, you know,

855
00:53:23,030 --> 00:53:25,680
kind of like when Montreal
booed Patrick was out of town.

856
00:53:26,100 --> 00:53:29,700
I love bringing this shit up and then
he goes out to fucking Colorado in

857
00:53:29,701 --> 00:53:33,180
immediately wins a Stanley Cup and then
like four years later wins another one.

858
00:53:33,420 --> 00:53:38,420
I love that now Montreal hasn't been a
factor since fucking 1993 I love that

859
00:53:39,031 --> 00:53:40,740
too.
It's over there.

860
00:53:40,741 --> 00:53:45,741
Last dynasty was 1979 they dominated
a 16 league that spilled over into the

861
00:53:46,531 --> 00:53:50,340
expansion six and then everybody got
their shit together and you haven't heard

862
00:53:50,370 --> 00:53:53,880
anything from those motherfuckers sense
and they're still walking around with

863
00:53:53,881 --> 00:53:57,510
their chest puffed out about some shit
that they did back in the three stooges

864
00:53:57,810 --> 00:54:00,840
error. You know, it's fucking over

865
00:54:02,340 --> 00:54:07,290
30 years ago. It's been 30 years since
you guys dominated the fucking Nhl.

866
00:54:07,990 --> 00:54:10,320
All right,
so get off your goddamn high horses.

867
00:54:11,430 --> 00:54:15,270
All right dad out to get me a couple of
emails. Okay. Let's continue on with the,

868
00:54:16,080 --> 00:54:19,590
with the podcast here. Um,
here's a couple of videos.

869
00:54:19,591 --> 00:54:23,140
If you want to watch this one that
I wanted you guys to check out. Um,

870
00:54:23,790 --> 00:54:25,830
there's a video of your van Halen Fan.

871
00:54:25,831 --> 00:54:30,630
Go on Youtube and check out van Halen
and it's a song in the cradle will rock.

872
00:54:31,050 --> 00:54:32,310
If you just search that,

873
00:54:32,400 --> 00:54:37,350
a bunch of videos will come up and
click on this second video down and uh,

874
00:54:37,500 --> 00:54:41,430
just look what David Lee Roth is wearing.
It's absolutely fucking hilarious.

875
00:54:41,431 --> 00:54:43,560
But I'm telling you,
as funny as it is,

876
00:54:43,860 --> 00:54:46,260
there's going to be a part of
you being like, God dammit,

877
00:54:46,320 --> 00:54:48,390
I wish I could get away with
wearing something like that.

878
00:54:49,500 --> 00:54:53,760
Can you imagine the amount of pussy I
would get if I wore something like had the

879
00:54:53,761 --> 00:54:56,220
balls to wear something like that?

880
00:54:57,480 --> 00:55:00,240
For those of you who aren't near a
fucking, I'll basically describe it,

881
00:55:00,241 --> 00:55:01,800
who aren't near a fucking
computer right now.

882
00:55:01,801 --> 00:55:06,210
Maybe you're on a treadmill trying to
work off that Burgee to Carl's Jr at two

883
00:55:06,211 --> 00:55:08,070
in the morning. No one,
you shouldn't have done it.

884
00:55:08,440 --> 00:55:11,400
We woke up this morning feeling like you
had a fucking anchor in your stomach.

885
00:55:11,860 --> 00:55:16,120
It goes fucking sweat it off.
He's basically wearing a

886
00:55:17,640 --> 00:55:18,630
picture. If you, if you,

887
00:55:18,631 --> 00:55:22,710
if you had a zoot suit made out of
Spandex and all you were wearing was the

888
00:55:22,711 --> 00:55:27,640
pants. So they basically came up right
underneath your fucking chest. Right.

889
00:55:30,000 --> 00:55:32,190
And then you remember those,
you remember those fucking,

890
00:55:33,150 --> 00:55:36,990
and they're in their purple sparkle
to all right. And then that's it.

891
00:55:36,991 --> 00:55:39,300
You don't have anything
else on other than,

892
00:55:39,450 --> 00:55:44,130
do you remember those boots that those
whores used to wear an aspen in like the

893
00:55:44,130 --> 00:55:46,530
late seventies early eighties where they
look like they skinned a woolly mammoth.

894
00:55:46,560 --> 00:55:50,280
He has on White, wooly,
mammoth snow boots.

895
00:55:51,060 --> 00:55:55,020
And the greatest thing is the crowd is
just fucking stick cause it's early on in

896
00:55:55,021 --> 00:55:58,710
their career. I don't know if it's from
another country. I have no fucking idea.

897
00:55:58,711 --> 00:55:59,880
I haven't watched it in awhile,

898
00:55:59,881 --> 00:56:02,730
but I was just remembering it and I
wanted you guys just check it out.

899
00:56:02,910 --> 00:56:07,560
Jesus Christ.
I told that fucking story in real time.

900
00:56:07,590 --> 00:56:11,520
All right, here's another one. Another
youtube video. Somebody sent me,

901
00:56:11,521 --> 00:56:16,521
it says a checkout Dwarf
midgets killer movie

902
00:56:18,900 --> 00:56:22,110
Tie, m. U. A. T. H. A. I, this is
basically, it's, it's very, uh,

903
00:56:22,200 --> 00:56:24,860
very accurately descriptive.
Uh, described it.

904
00:56:24,861 --> 00:56:28,870
It's one guy is a dwarf and the other
guy's a midget or a little person as the

905
00:56:28,871 --> 00:56:32,570
new way class that they invented
a little person and they are, uh,

906
00:56:34,500 --> 00:56:36,280
they're fighting somewhere,
I'm going to guess,

907
00:56:36,400 --> 00:56:41,400
and maybe the Philippines and it's a
Muay Thai fight and it starts off funny.

908
00:56:42,220 --> 00:56:45,790
Then you think it's fake because the
midget keeps hitting the door off with the

909
00:56:45,791 --> 00:56:48,800
exact same fucking punch.
The dwarf keeps trying to kneel knee,

910
00:56:49,150 --> 00:56:52,600
neither midget and the chest
and the midget keeps coming
with an overhand right.

911
00:56:53,080 --> 00:56:56,150
And I was kept thinking,
why the fuck is he keeps,

912
00:56:56,390 --> 00:56:59,410
why the fuck does he keep throwing
the same punch? This must be fake.

913
00:56:59,411 --> 00:57:03,700
But then I realized that the boxing gloves
on the midget actually go beyond his

914
00:57:03,701 --> 00:57:06,260
elbow. So he couldn't throw
a hook if he wanted to.

915
00:57:08,230 --> 00:57:10,120
And then after that,
it just becomes sad.

916
00:57:11,350 --> 00:57:14,290
There's something about the dwarfs face
where he just really looks like he's

917
00:57:14,291 --> 00:57:18,620
getting, he's physically at paint. The
midget has, you know, we still got that,

918
00:57:19,080 --> 00:57:22,420
that Christmas twinkle in his eye.
He seems like he's having a good time.

919
00:57:22,750 --> 00:57:24,880
He's got a little bit
of swagger in his water.

920
00:57:25,540 --> 00:57:29,290
She's probably getting some pussy
after the show, you know. And uh,

921
00:57:29,740 --> 00:57:32,770
that's a good question. Would you have a
lot of Midget Bang you women out there?

922
00:57:33,340 --> 00:57:37,780
I know some guys have banked
a little person, but I was
just wondering, you know,

923
00:57:37,960 --> 00:57:40,860
if he just laid down on your stomach
and you just felt like that, like that

924
00:57:45,220 --> 00:57:47,560
at wiggle and eight year
old riding you from behind,

925
00:57:51,680 --> 00:57:54,260
do you know how long your hair would have
to be so you could actually pull it in

926
00:57:54,261 --> 00:57:57,500
that position? Why am I being such an
asshole this week? I don't know why.

927
00:57:57,530 --> 00:57:59,810
All right, next, uh, next
youtube video. I'll tell you why.

928
00:57:59,960 --> 00:58:01,430
Because I don't have a fucking show.

929
00:58:02,130 --> 00:58:06,200
I don't have a show tonight
and I'm waiting to take a
red eye, JetBlue, JetBlue,

930
00:58:06,201 --> 00:58:08,570
back to a f.
Jfk.

931
00:58:10,450 --> 00:58:13,610
I'm not looking forward to going back
to New York this time of year with that

932
00:58:13,611 --> 00:58:17,600
fucking weather. I really have
not missed the winner whatsoever.

933
00:58:17,601 --> 00:58:21,440
That's a big thing they asked in the east
coast. Don't you miss the four seasons?

934
00:58:22,490 --> 00:58:25,010
What Frankie Valli and those guys here,
is that when you say,

935
00:58:25,610 --> 00:58:30,230
do I miss the four seasons? No,
I don't. No, I don't. I like it.

936
00:58:30,260 --> 00:58:35,260
I like being old and being in the
retirement community that is Los Angeles.

937
00:58:35,271 --> 00:58:39,980
I like it. It's, you know
what La is like, it's like a,

938
00:58:39,981 --> 00:58:43,850
it's like Florida for somebody
who's still middle aged, you know,

939
00:58:44,600 --> 00:58:47,420
you go to Florida, does it die?
That's the last place I'll go,

940
00:58:47,450 --> 00:58:51,230
go out there and get me a gator boat,
you know, that's what I'm going to do.

941
00:58:51,231 --> 00:58:56,090
That's how I'm going to parachute out
of my life. I'm going to, uh, yeah.

942
00:58:56,490 --> 00:58:59,300
I'll probably get a divorce and just
say, listen, I'm cashing in my chips.

943
00:58:59,301 --> 00:59:02,390
I can't do this. We had kids all rights
fucking over there out of the house.

944
00:59:02,900 --> 00:59:05,510
What do we do? Stare at each other
for the rest of fucking time.

945
00:59:06,530 --> 00:59:09,500
So I sit there and watch watching you
slowly gumming those waffles that used to

946
00:59:09,501 --> 00:59:12,230
be able to tear through an English
muffin in a minute and a half.

947
00:59:12,770 --> 00:59:16,790
Now we sit here for fucking
37 minutes as I watched.

948
00:59:17,390 --> 00:59:19,790
I don't want to live that life with
you. Okay? We had a great time.

949
00:59:21,020 --> 00:59:22,010
I give you a high five,

950
00:59:22,011 --> 00:59:24,470
but I'm afraid I'm going to break
his shoulder and then I'll go.

951
00:59:25,260 --> 00:59:28,640
Then I'm going to go down to Florida
and I'm just going to get one of those

952
00:59:28,641 --> 00:59:30,950
fucking boats with the fan on the back.
And I'm going to give,

953
00:59:30,951 --> 00:59:35,290
I'm going to give everglade tours is I
want to play some Pentair and some ACDC.

954
00:59:35,540 --> 00:59:39,050
I'm going to have on affected
southern accent and that's it.

955
00:59:39,310 --> 00:59:43,880
And I'm gonna live off my DVD money
even though I won't exist anymore.

956
00:59:44,900 --> 00:59:49,250
Um, and I'm addressed all in
khaki. Okay, let's continue on. Um,

957
00:59:49,430 --> 00:59:52,500
the next youtube video that
you can look at is, uh,

958
00:59:52,970 --> 00:59:57,800
there's one called a public access
TV hosts bombarded with prank calls,

959
00:59:58,220 --> 01:00:00,560
is the name of it.
I don't know if this is the right video.

960
01:00:00,560 --> 01:00:04,130
Somebody sent this one to me
and I accidentally deleted it.

961
01:00:04,131 --> 01:00:07,190
So I just buy him describing it.
I think this is the one,

962
01:00:07,191 --> 01:00:11,960
so look it up and it's basically a guy
in public access trying to talk about gun

963
01:00:11,961 --> 01:00:16,700
control. And it's such a low budget
that, you know, it's not pre,

964
01:00:16,730 --> 01:00:19,640
it's basically live and he
puts his phone number up there.

965
01:00:20,630 --> 01:00:23,320
So somebody calls in realize is it's,
you know,

966
01:00:23,330 --> 01:00:26,120
realizes that it's alive and
tells them to go fuck himself.

967
01:00:26,150 --> 01:00:27,680
And then the entire audience,

968
01:00:27,681 --> 01:00:32,230
like a bunch of Goddamn children call in
in all they're saying is just the dirty

969
01:00:32,460 --> 01:00:34,130
as shit that they can basically think of.

970
01:00:34,520 --> 01:00:38,870
The best guys are the ones who actually
start talking about gun control for a

971
01:00:38,870 --> 01:00:42,200
minute. So this guy actually feels
like he's having a discussion

972
01:00:43,820 --> 01:00:46,040
and right as the guys
starts to engage with them,

973
01:00:46,041 --> 01:00:50,180
they tell them to go fuck himself. So if
you're an angry prek like me, it's an I,

974
01:00:50,190 --> 01:00:54,830
it's actually a a, it's a
nice one. So with that, um,

975
01:00:55,970 --> 01:01:00,920
I have been on lumosity.com
for all of last week, uh,

976
01:01:01,070 --> 01:01:03,860
trying to get my BPI score to go up,
which is,

977
01:01:03,861 --> 01:01:05,450
I don't even know what
the fuck it stands for.

978
01:01:06,140 --> 01:01:10,940
Basically the higher the number you
have, the less a moron. I don't know.

979
01:01:10,970 --> 01:01:13,780
I was going to say retarded, but
I don't like using that word. Uh,

980
01:01:13,790 --> 01:01:16,400
even though I've already said it
five times as fucking podcasts,

981
01:01:16,670 --> 01:01:20,930
the less dumb you are I guess are the
smarter you are, the higher it is. Right.

982
01:01:21,500 --> 01:01:23,030
I got confused in the middle of it.
I don't know.

983
01:01:23,060 --> 01:01:24,380
I'm worried about my brain right now,

984
01:01:24,381 --> 01:01:28,700
everybody because it's feeling fuzzy
and I think a lot of it has to do with

985
01:01:28,701 --> 01:01:32,960
talking on my cell phone too much and
I'm trying to cut down on that like a

986
01:01:32,961 --> 01:01:36,470
cigarette smoker and I've been
going to this, this website,

987
01:01:37,530 --> 01:01:40,160
Lumosity Dotcom and has these,
these games that challenge your brain.

988
01:01:40,500 --> 01:01:44,900
It's fucking awesome. And they got
everything out. Any, any type of,

989
01:01:46,220 --> 01:01:48,050
any type of stuff that
you could be thinking of?

990
01:01:48,051 --> 01:01:50,660
I don't know if I talked about this last
week, so I'll kind of blow through it.

991
01:01:50,780 --> 01:01:54,410
It's Lumosity, l,U , m
o, s. I. T, Y. Dot Com.

992
01:01:54,590 --> 01:01:58,460
Somebody else also suggested one that was,
um,

993
01:01:58,670 --> 01:02:01,670
I don't know how to read it because
it's a website here. That's all,

994
01:02:01,671 --> 01:02:06,200
I don't know how to say it here. It's,
it's www.no spaces here. P, O, s.

995
01:02:06,230 --> 01:02:09,500
I. T. S. C. I. E. N. C e. So it's

996
01:02:11,000 --> 01:02:15,470
posted science, Pos, it, science.com. Um,

997
01:02:15,530 --> 01:02:19,410
and they have these brain games and I
really think in an a number of years,

998
01:02:19,411 --> 01:02:22,260
that's where I did talk about this last
week, that the, that they're basically,

999
01:02:22,261 --> 01:02:26,460
instead of having all these, these
exercise shows at night that involves,

1000
01:02:26,461 --> 01:02:28,860
you know, getting fucking abs
and all that type of shit,

1001
01:02:28,980 --> 01:02:31,350
they are actually going to be
selling stuff late at night.

1002
01:02:31,350 --> 01:02:34,950
That's going to be basically
crunches for your brain. And um,

1003
01:02:36,060 --> 01:02:39,930
I would recommend it. It's Kinda
been my new thing that I do out here.

1004
01:02:40,410 --> 01:02:44,280
I told you I've been trying to learn,
learn how to write with my right hand.

1005
01:02:44,790 --> 01:02:47,770
I'll tell you about that shit.
I'm a lefty and somebody,

1006
01:02:47,900 --> 01:02:50,580
this comedian was telling me about
this book that he was reading that uh,

1007
01:02:50,670 --> 01:02:54,030
if you actually do things
with your opposite hand,

1008
01:02:54,031 --> 01:02:58,440
it opens up different areas
of your brain. And, um,

1009
01:02:58,500 --> 01:03:01,950
so I've been doing that, you know,
I'm writing with my right hand.

1010
01:03:02,490 --> 01:03:06,270
I've been throwing shit around my,
my hotel room with my left hand.

1011
01:03:06,720 --> 01:03:10,140
I'm kind of fucked up where I,
I, I kind of jump back and forth,

1012
01:03:10,530 --> 01:03:14,550
play guitar left to I play drums,
righty. I play sports right handed.

1013
01:03:14,730 --> 01:03:19,730
I write lefthanded I can use tools
either hand fucking rub one out with the

1014
01:03:19,831 --> 01:03:22,770
left, but in a pinch.
Okay, let's plow ahead.

1015
01:03:22,771 --> 01:03:24,180
So this is the type of
Shit I've been doing.

1016
01:03:24,181 --> 01:03:26,670
So I've been learning how to write
with my right hand and I basically,

1017
01:03:26,671 --> 01:03:28,440
my hand writing with
my right hand looks at,

1018
01:03:28,720 --> 01:03:32,250
looks like my handwriting
in like fourth grade. Um,

1019
01:03:33,890 --> 01:03:38,100
it looks like if I,
if I was in the fourth grade and um,

1020
01:03:38,370 --> 01:03:43,020
I just saw a ghost. That's the way
it looks. It's looking very spooky.

1021
01:03:43,590 --> 01:03:46,680
But, uh, I've also been trying to
learn how to become a better speller.

1022
01:03:46,770 --> 01:03:49,260
I just ain't no something like I always
make fun of how the fact that I'm a

1023
01:03:49,261 --> 01:03:52,560
fucking moron and I'm like Terry Bradshaw,

1024
01:03:52,680 --> 01:03:57,600
I definitely play up my stupidity,
but there's definitely a seed of a,

1025
01:03:57,990 --> 01:04:02,190
or maybe some people would say a deep
well of stupidity that I actually have.

1026
01:04:02,550 --> 01:04:06,810
And most of it, um, is
art. It just laziness.

1027
01:04:07,920 --> 01:04:08,191
I mean,

1028
01:04:08,191 --> 01:04:11,760
there's no reason why I should know how
to spell the word restaurant at my age.

1029
01:04:12,090 --> 01:04:15,330
I've been to a bunch of them and I've
tried to spell it a million times.

1030
01:04:15,331 --> 01:04:20,130
And for the life of me, I always forget
if the u comes after the first a Oh,

1031
01:04:20,131 --> 01:04:25,080
the second a and m I've tried this a
number of times and I'm going to try to

1032
01:04:25,081 --> 01:04:27,810
stick with it is I just as I,
you know,

1033
01:04:28,050 --> 01:04:31,770
tried to type an email and rather than
just hitting spellcheck and just moving

1034
01:04:31,771 --> 01:04:34,560
on with my life, I'm trying to
actually make a list of words.

1035
01:04:34,561 --> 01:04:38,670
I don't know how to sell, sell,
spell, see how my brain's fucked up.

1036
01:04:39,870 --> 01:04:44,820
Um, and then what I do is I, then
I write, I write the word properly,

1037
01:04:44,821 --> 01:04:48,750
like 10 times in a row. Um, but
I write it with my right hand.

1038
01:04:48,900 --> 01:04:52,110
So I'm kind of doing two things at once
and it's fucking hilarious because I

1039
01:04:52,111 --> 01:04:56,340
kind of left this shit out and I was
just thinking of the poor cleaning lady

1040
01:04:56,341 --> 01:04:57,000
coming in here.

1041
01:04:57,000 --> 01:05:00,000
Like one of the words I was learning
how to spell was penitentiary.

1042
01:05:00,330 --> 01:05:05,330
So I have penitentiary
written like fucking 12 times
in this spooky I'm writing

1043
01:05:05,671 --> 01:05:08,460
with my opposite hand,
fucking penmanship.

1044
01:05:09,120 --> 01:05:12,720
And I just kept thinking of the shining
all work and no play makes jack a dull

1045
01:05:12,721 --> 01:05:16,180
boy, you know? So, uh, I dunno,

1046
01:05:17,350 --> 01:05:21,700
trying to become a smarter human being.
Am I boring the shit out of you?

1047
01:05:21,701 --> 01:05:23,860
Because I think that last
segment was a little boring,

1048
01:05:24,130 --> 01:05:27,250
but I'm into this shit man. I'm sick
of just knowing stuff about sports.

1049
01:05:27,910 --> 01:05:28,631
I actually,
you know what,

1050
01:05:28,631 --> 01:05:33,220
I'm going to Europe in two weeks and I
desperately do not want to come off as

1051
01:05:33,310 --> 01:05:37,120
the typical stupid American.
At least I'm in shape. Okay.

1052
01:05:37,390 --> 01:05:41,860
So I'm going to be real, you know,
representing us nicely in that category.

1053
01:05:41,861 --> 01:05:46,000
The fact that I'm 41 years old and I'm
still fucking in shape. Jesus Christ,

1054
01:05:46,001 --> 01:05:47,470
I almost fell backwards on this chair.

1055
01:05:47,980 --> 01:05:51,280
I didn't understand how far away the
curtains were. I should have gone with it.

1056
01:05:51,281 --> 01:05:53,680
At least it would have been fucking funny.
Let me see if I can lean back here.

1057
01:05:53,740 --> 01:05:57,790
Easy, easy, easy. It's not working. Um,

1058
01:05:59,800 --> 01:06:04,780
oh Jesus. Oh Jesus. Hang on one second.

1059
01:06:05,830 --> 01:06:10,250
Hello. Hey, let me call you
back in like 20 minutes. Okay.

1060
01:06:14,520 --> 01:06:18,210
Okay, cool. All right. But um,

1061
01:06:18,690 --> 01:06:23,280
so anyways, uh, the
fuck am I talking about?

1062
01:06:23,310 --> 01:06:26,910
I got a, um, I got this magazine,

1063
01:06:26,911 --> 01:06:28,470
Scientific American because I'm like,

1064
01:06:28,471 --> 01:06:30,950
I can't keep reading these
fucking sports magazines. And two,

1065
01:06:30,960 --> 01:06:33,750
there was a guy in there,
these egg heads when they want to,

1066
01:06:34,440 --> 01:06:36,870
as much as I'd love trash and
people, if you notice, you know,

1067
01:06:37,170 --> 01:06:39,630
I just insult the way you
look and I say fuck a lot,

1068
01:06:39,631 --> 01:06:43,860
but these guys are actually intelligent
human beings and this guy was making fun

1069
01:06:43,861 --> 01:06:45,960
of people who tell stories.

1070
01:06:45,961 --> 01:06:48,360
You ever see those stories
where people say they died,

1071
01:06:48,810 --> 01:06:52,980
I was dead for two minutes and then I
came back and then they come on and they

1072
01:06:52,981 --> 01:06:55,110
start talking about the
stuff that they saw.

1073
01:06:55,740 --> 01:06:59,910
But that the way this scientist guy
breaks the shit down scientist guy that I

1074
01:06:59,911 --> 01:07:03,060
really just say that the
way this dude just shines,

1075
01:07:04,470 --> 01:07:08,790
Dude Rye do I break shit down?
Um, it's just fucking brilliant.

1076
01:07:09,270 --> 01:07:14,070
He basically says, you're not dead.
You had a near death experience.

1077
01:07:14,640 --> 01:07:18,600
You were in a a a near death state.

1078
01:07:18,990 --> 01:07:22,260
You weren't dead if you were dead,
you dead.

1079
01:07:22,290 --> 01:07:26,400
They can't bring you back from being dead.
All right.

1080
01:07:26,700 --> 01:07:31,200
Even if you fucking hard
stops just because your heart
stops the dying process.

1081
01:07:31,201 --> 01:07:35,940
This guy was the way he broke it down
and he said it can take anywhere from a

1082
01:07:35,940 --> 01:07:39,900
couple of minutes to a couple of hours
to occur depending on the conditions.

1083
01:07:40,080 --> 01:07:41,150
So even if somebody,

1084
01:07:41,430 --> 01:07:45,540
unless you get just
fucking blown up vaporized,

1085
01:07:46,080 --> 01:07:48,300
even if somebody shoots
you in the fucking heart,

1086
01:07:48,890 --> 01:07:52,650
your brain is still going to be firing,
synapsis and or whatever. The Fox.

1087
01:07:52,651 --> 01:07:53,970
I'm too stupid to know.
What it is,

1088
01:07:53,971 --> 01:07:58,150
but it still takes another couple of
minutes and other stuff like he said,

1089
01:07:58,170 --> 01:07:59,730
can take up to a couple of hours.

1090
01:08:00,270 --> 01:08:03,360
So these fucking people who think they're
dead or not dead and they're coming on

1091
01:08:04,530 --> 01:08:09,210
TV talking about the shit they saw, like
they, like they were in another fucking,

1092
01:08:09,211 --> 01:08:10,800
I dunno universe and they weren't.

1093
01:08:11,820 --> 01:08:15,680
So he basically in the
Deepak Chopra is to you know,

1094
01:08:15,681 --> 01:08:18,410
is on this Larry King show
describing what's going on.

1095
01:08:18,411 --> 01:08:22,880
So the guy basically concludes it with
this when a cause one other scientists

1096
01:08:22,881 --> 01:08:25,490
was actually kind of agreeing with
Deek Pock Chopra by saying, you know,

1097
01:08:25,491 --> 01:08:29,240
there's some stuff out there that we
just, you know, science, you know,

1098
01:08:29,300 --> 01:08:33,470
has no explanation for.
And this guy says, so what?

1099
01:08:34,250 --> 01:08:38,810
The fact that we cannot fully explain a
mystery without natural means does not

1100
01:08:38,811 --> 01:08:41,750
mean it requires a
supernatural explanation.

1101
01:08:42,080 --> 01:08:43,850
It just means we don't know everything.

1102
01:08:44,150 --> 01:08:48,590
Such uncertainty is at the very heart
of science and is what makes it such a

1103
01:08:48,591 --> 01:08:50,120
challenging enterprise.

1104
01:08:50,390 --> 01:08:55,100
And in that moment there was a clap of
thunder and I realized that science is

1105
01:08:55,101 --> 01:08:57,500
religion for intelligent people.

1106
01:08:58,520 --> 01:09:01,520
This guy isn't saying that there's no god,

1107
01:09:02,180 --> 01:09:07,130
but he's also not listening to some guy
half naked dancing around a fucking fire

1108
01:09:07,490 --> 01:09:11,180
with a chicken foot. You know what I
mean? So I think that's what I think.

1109
01:09:11,181 --> 01:09:14,210
I think science is religion
for intelligent people.

1110
01:09:14,290 --> 01:09:17,750
And I think religion and a lot
of ways is science for morons.

1111
01:09:18,740 --> 01:09:23,090
Whenever they can't explain something,
they invent stories of people having,

1112
01:09:23,091 --> 01:09:27,230
you know, all you can eat fish coming out
of a wicker basket or fucking, you know,

1113
01:09:27,231 --> 01:09:32,210
you got to have faith. You've got to have
faith. It's a fucking cop out. You know,

1114
01:09:33,950 --> 01:09:36,990
if you went to go buy a fucking car
and you go, all right, let me look,

1115
01:09:37,010 --> 01:09:39,230
the car wouldn't start up.
Don't worry. Don't worry.

1116
01:09:39,470 --> 01:09:43,550
One of these days that engine's coming
back and it's going to be mad and it's

1117
01:09:43,551 --> 01:09:48,530
going to be judging you.
It's ridiculous. You know,

1118
01:09:48,531 --> 01:09:51,500
Jesus, I don't want to get off on this
fucking rant, but definitely check it out,

1119
01:09:51,501 --> 01:09:56,210
man. If you want to read some cool stuff,
it's called scientific American. And uh,

1120
01:09:56,211 --> 01:09:58,910
I dunno, I'm kind of on this mission.
I'm, I'm sick of being a moron,

1121
01:09:59,870 --> 01:10:04,210
so it could be in, you know, I'm sick
of being fucking stupid. I really am.

1122
01:10:05,590 --> 01:10:10,390
Um, so anyways, let's get to, uh,
let's get to underrated overrated.

1123
01:10:11,620 --> 01:10:14,080
Um,
what are we 38 minutes and look at me.

1124
01:10:14,081 --> 01:10:16,810
I've really could fucking run my
mouth when I want to before I get into

1125
01:10:16,811 --> 01:10:17,740
underrated.
Overrated.

1126
01:10:17,980 --> 01:10:21,790
I gotta read this one and I'm going to
need some help from you guys on this.

1127
01:10:23,270 --> 01:10:27,460
Um, listen to this one. Uh,
this is from some dude. Uh,

1128
01:10:27,461 --> 01:10:30,790
I believe he's in Italy and he said,
um,

1129
01:10:30,850 --> 01:10:33,700
I kill women's Libidos for a living.

1130
01:10:35,250 --> 01:10:39,580
All right, here we go. Fucking strap
yourselves in for this one. Hey, Bill.

1131
01:10:41,620 --> 01:10:45,780
I just got out of my second of my
two longterm relationships, um,

1132
01:10:45,790 --> 01:10:50,320
three plus years, both of which
eerily started and ended the same.

1133
01:10:51,870 --> 01:10:51,910
Uh,

1134
01:10:51,910 --> 01:10:55,300
both of these girls were well above
average in their sexual enlightenment when

1135
01:10:55,301 --> 01:10:57,970
we started dating.
I'm not saying they were super freaky,

1136
01:10:58,150 --> 01:11:02,650
but the kind of girls that have a porno
collection that can rival most guys and

1137
01:11:02,651 --> 01:11:04,030
the toys to match.

1138
01:11:04,330 --> 01:11:07,180
Also the kind of girls that while you're
home visiting your parents for the

1139
01:11:07,181 --> 01:11:07,870
holidays,

1140
01:11:07,870 --> 01:11:11,410
we'll want to sneak away from the dinner
table and fucking in the bathroom.

1141
01:11:11,940 --> 01:11:15,270
[inaudible] okay. Anyways, um,

1142
01:11:15,271 --> 01:11:17,400
it seems that the standards
for most of these relations,

1143
01:11:17,700 --> 01:11:20,820
the standard for most relationship is
that you fuck like rabbits during the

1144
01:11:20,821 --> 01:11:24,510
first year. If you manage to
make it past the one year mark,

1145
01:11:24,900 --> 01:11:29,670
there is an exponential decay in the
pussy rationing until you get married or

1146
01:11:29,671 --> 01:11:33,510
have kids at which time you're pretty
much done with the sex except for

1147
01:11:33,511 --> 01:11:36,590
birthdays in the anniversary.
However, the section,

1148
01:11:36,600 --> 01:11:39,630
these two relationships kept going
strong through the second year,

1149
01:11:39,780 --> 01:11:43,340
at which point it completely dropped
off. And I'm not just, I don't,

1150
01:11:43,440 --> 01:11:45,420
I'm not kidding,
I'm talking just done.

1151
01:11:45,690 --> 01:11:49,230
I had to pull out every trick in the book
just to get his sympathy fucking once

1152
01:11:49,231 --> 01:11:51,390
every couple of weeks.
Um,

1153
01:11:52,140 --> 01:11:54,690
I'm in a committed relationship
and love these girls.

1154
01:11:55,320 --> 01:11:57,600
I guess you were in a committed
relationship and you love these girls.

1155
01:11:57,601 --> 01:12:00,570
So I guess she didn't fuck
around. All right. Um,

1156
01:12:00,990 --> 01:12:04,260
and love these girls enough to put up
with the bullshit with the idea that we'll

1157
01:12:04,261 --> 01:12:07,200
be able to work through the issue and
get back on track. However, as I learned,

1158
01:12:07,400 --> 01:12:10,410
once the pussy is boarded up,
it's out of business for good.

1159
01:12:10,620 --> 01:12:14,670
It's like those fucking horrific strip
malls that have been abandoned since the

1160
01:12:14,670 --> 01:12:15,900
80s when whatever shit,

1161
01:12:15,901 --> 01:12:19,080
boom economy in the area made those
fucking people think they were going to go

1162
01:12:19,081 --> 01:12:23,580
somewhere. So inevitably when these
relationships and I end up, uh,

1163
01:12:24,540 --> 01:12:25,530
I get red,
my,

1164
01:12:26,080 --> 01:12:31,080
my fucking straight a report card on how
much I'm such a great guy and I'm loved

1165
01:12:31,171 --> 01:12:34,410
so much and they don't want to
lose me as a part of their lives,

1166
01:12:34,411 --> 01:12:37,650
but they're just not sexually
attracted to me anymore.

1167
01:12:38,640 --> 01:12:42,180
And that is the fucking and that, that,
and this is the best fucking part.

1168
01:12:42,450 --> 01:12:43,680
They don't know why.

1169
01:12:44,550 --> 01:12:48,420
They don't know why then not sexually
attracted to me anymore and really wish

1170
01:12:48,421 --> 01:12:50,640
they could change it seriously.

1171
01:12:50,641 --> 01:12:54,390
What the fuck no man
wants to admit to himself,

1172
01:12:54,391 --> 01:12:58,370
let alone an audience that
he's not getting alone.
They, he's not getting that.

1173
01:12:58,590 --> 01:13:00,570
He's not getting it done
between the sheets. However,

1174
01:13:00,571 --> 01:13:04,380
I can honestly say that I do. All
right. I'm no fucking Ron Jeremy,

1175
01:13:04,381 --> 01:13:05,520
but I get the job done.

1176
01:13:05,730 --> 01:13:10,710
I would understand the plight of these
woman if I was a Ferb blasting them.

1177
01:13:10,830 --> 01:13:12,210
I don't know what that means.
What does that mean?

1178
01:13:12,211 --> 01:13:16,350
Just jumping on them like an 18 year old
pounding away or wanting to do the same

1179
01:13:16,351 --> 01:13:17,340
shit over and over again.

1180
01:13:17,341 --> 01:13:21,690
But I usually make a pretty good damn
effort to make sure things stay fun in the

1181
01:13:21,691 --> 01:13:26,370
bedroom. All right. Okay. Last
two fucking paragraphs. Uh,

1182
01:13:27,030 --> 01:13:31,890
let me just, let me just a paraphrase
is he basically says that he's like, uh,

1183
01:13:31,910 --> 01:13:35,640
William h Macy's character in the cooler.
Um,

1184
01:13:37,170 --> 01:13:40,440
and he's saying that he's getting really
bitter and he wants to go out right now

1185
01:13:40,441 --> 01:13:41,370
and go meet a woman,

1186
01:13:41,371 --> 01:13:45,120
fuck the shit out of her for three months
and then give her the same speech that

1187
01:13:45,121 --> 01:13:49,770
just happened to him. Um, all right. Okay.

1188
01:13:49,771 --> 01:13:51,690
First of all,
don't do that.

1189
01:13:52,200 --> 01:13:56,190
Don't deliberately go out and hurt
somebody because you dated two people who

1190
01:13:56,191 --> 01:13:59,760
hurt you. That's just, it's,
it's bad. They don't deserve
it. They didn't hurt you.

1191
01:13:59,761 --> 01:14:03,940
So don't do that. All right. Um, I,

1192
01:14:04,420 --> 01:14:05,850
I don't know what I mean.
Yeah.

1193
01:14:05,851 --> 01:14:08,460
I'd have to have more details
of what the fuck's going on,

1194
01:14:08,461 --> 01:14:13,030
but I will tell you this from,
I know a lot of people,

1195
01:14:14,020 --> 01:14:19,020
they get into a relationship with
somebody and it doesn't go right.

1196
01:14:19,721 --> 01:14:22,480
They find out that it's not
what they're looking for.

1197
01:14:22,780 --> 01:14:27,780
And then they go out and then
they immediately basically
start dating the same

1198
01:14:27,881 --> 01:14:32,140
person again. It's not literally
the same person, but it's basically,

1199
01:14:32,590 --> 01:14:37,580
you know, like, just to make it simple,
if a woman went out and was Dayton,

1200
01:14:37,780 --> 01:14:41,860
met some guy at a fucking truck stop
and he turns out to be an asshole.

1201
01:14:41,950 --> 01:14:45,130
He's driving a truck, fucking a bunch of
other women around the country. She goes,

1202
01:14:45,131 --> 01:14:47,560
I'll never fucking get with a
piece of shit like that again.

1203
01:14:47,680 --> 01:14:50,290
And where does she go? She goes
right back down to the truck stop,

1204
01:14:50,291 --> 01:14:52,870
which is the same gene
pool of fucking people.

1205
01:14:53,380 --> 01:14:58,380
And I think it's very interesting that
you met two girls who seemed like they

1206
01:14:58,991 --> 01:15:03,100
were the exact same right down to when
they want it to stop fucking you and I

1207
01:15:03,360 --> 01:15:05,860
gotta admit,
okay,

1208
01:15:06,130 --> 01:15:11,110
I guess a woman having a porn collection
is healthy on some level, but that,

1209
01:15:11,111 --> 01:15:13,450
you know, I don't know as far as I
could girl you're going to marry.

1210
01:15:13,451 --> 01:15:16,720
It's like you want your girl,
it's that fine line.

1211
01:15:16,730 --> 01:15:19,450
You want them to fuck your brains out,
but do you really want to bang,

1212
01:15:19,451 --> 01:15:23,980
have them want to fuck you in your
parents house? I mean, I dunno dude.

1213
01:15:24,070 --> 01:15:27,850
I mean, I, I what I, what
I would guess is I would,

1214
01:15:28,510 --> 01:15:30,610
I would start fishing in a different lake.

1215
01:15:31,120 --> 01:15:35,530
It sounds to me like you're a
fucking goddamn trout. Again.

1216
01:15:35,950 --> 01:15:38,830
Can't fucking believe it. You
know, go out in the ocean,

1217
01:15:38,831 --> 01:15:40,480
you'll catch something else.
You know what I'm saying?

1218
01:15:40,600 --> 01:15:44,020
I think he got the same person
again. I mean, but I mean,

1219
01:15:44,021 --> 01:15:46,780
I would literally have to fucking be
knowing what you're doing in the bedroom,

1220
01:15:46,781 --> 01:15:49,360
which I don't want to know.
Um,

1221
01:15:51,060 --> 01:15:53,140
well what about you?
Do you start taking,

1222
01:15:53,141 --> 01:15:56,650
I guess you said you don't take her off
cause that's another thing that happens

1223
01:15:56,651 --> 01:15:59,320
in relationships. You know,
there's like, you know,

1224
01:16:00,040 --> 01:16:04,240
big thing with women is
they like kissing and uh,

1225
01:16:04,270 --> 01:16:08,830
guys are very focused on the,
on, on the finish line, the goal.

1226
01:16:08,860 --> 01:16:13,150
So you know, you're getting
that relationship like we
haven't had sex in a while.

1227
01:16:13,151 --> 01:16:16,210
You want to have sex when
you start getting in that
fucking thing it, you know,

1228
01:16:16,211 --> 01:16:20,350
and you just start scheduling it.
I how does your day look?

1229
01:16:20,351 --> 01:16:24,250
Maybe around four. Okay.
Okay. We will fuck at four,

1230
01:16:25,090 --> 01:16:29,380
you know, and you know, you're not even
self conscious so there's no excitement.

1231
01:16:29,381 --> 01:16:30,910
You just fucking take your clothes off.

1232
01:16:30,911 --> 01:16:34,840
Like you're getting strip searched on
your way to serving time at fucking, uh,

1233
01:16:35,650 --> 01:16:37,960
some penitentiary.
Penitentiary,

1234
01:16:38,470 --> 01:16:42,850
p e n I t and t I a r y penitentiary.

1235
01:16:46,060 --> 01:16:46,361
Sorry.

1236
01:16:46,361 --> 01:16:49,060
It's one of the words I learned this
week and I was trying to remember Rikers

1237
01:16:49,061 --> 01:16:53,800
island and I couldn't at that point. So
do it. I don't know what to tell you.

1238
01:16:54,160 --> 01:16:56,410
The bottom line. I don't give a fuck
who you are. How I'm in love you.

1239
01:16:56,411 --> 01:16:58,570
I was somebody after a while,
you're going to get sick of fucking him.

1240
01:16:58,810 --> 01:17:01,240
That's what happens.
Um,

1241
01:17:03,280 --> 01:17:05,350
I dunno,
I dunno what's going on.

1242
01:17:05,351 --> 01:17:09,350
I don't know if you have some sort of
like delayed halitosis where for the two

1243
01:17:09,351 --> 01:17:12,290
years you have wonderful breath and
then all of a sudden it's unbearable.

1244
01:17:12,320 --> 01:17:14,660
I'm just fucking with you. I want to
give you a complex, but I'm just saying,

1245
01:17:15,020 --> 01:17:18,230
I don't know what I would try to,
to meet girls in a different place.

1246
01:17:18,231 --> 01:17:21,170
I would start with that.
And um,

1247
01:17:23,270 --> 01:17:26,690
I dunno. I Dunno dude. This one
is beyond me. I've never, uh,

1248
01:17:28,580 --> 01:17:30,060
I mean,
part of me wants to say you'd be,

1249
01:17:30,170 --> 01:17:34,400
you're being a little too hard on
yourself here. Uh, but whatever,

1250
01:17:34,401 --> 01:17:38,300
go out there and, uh, you know, I'll go
bank some fucking women. Yes. Single,

1251
01:17:38,480 --> 01:17:41,210
go out there banks and
fuck a woman and is always,

1252
01:17:41,420 --> 01:17:44,810
always talk to women that you think
errata eleague always do that shit.

1253
01:17:44,811 --> 01:17:46,400
The worst thing they can do is say no,

1254
01:17:46,520 --> 01:17:50,690
but one of them is going to fucking say
yes and that'll give you more confidence

1255
01:17:50,810 --> 01:17:53,600
and you'll keep moving up the draft board.
Next thing you know,

1256
01:17:53,930 --> 01:17:57,470
you polling pussy out of the first
round rather than drafting like you're

1257
01:17:57,471 --> 01:18:00,650
fucking won the Superbowl last year.
You know, having that 28th pick,

1258
01:18:01,430 --> 01:18:05,210
praying that the female version of
fucking Dan Marino still around.

1259
01:18:05,840 --> 01:18:09,620
That didn't make sense. But you
know what I'm saying? Um, anyways,

1260
01:18:10,670 --> 01:18:15,410
am I almost done here?
46 minutes in 46 minutes into the podcast.

1261
01:18:15,411 --> 01:18:18,980
Let's wrap this shit up here. People with
a little bit of underrated overrated.

1262
01:18:18,981 --> 01:18:20,930
Shall we underrated a bill.

1263
01:18:20,931 --> 01:18:25,100
Last week you got an email
from a fan that recounted eh,

1264
01:18:25,160 --> 01:18:27,530
his sister's Wiccan wedding.
Personally,

1265
01:18:27,531 --> 01:18:30,350
I think the ritual was that
was discussed in the wedding.

1266
01:18:30,351 --> 01:18:32,270
His fucking mind numbingly insane,

1267
01:18:32,271 --> 01:18:35,960
but part of me has to give it up to the
couple that got married. I'll, sorry.

1268
01:18:35,961 --> 01:18:39,710
Underrated is a having balls.
Um, they knew their ritual would,

1269
01:18:39,711 --> 01:18:43,310
would not be well received, but they
did not give a fuck. It was their day,

1270
01:18:43,430 --> 01:18:45,440
and they had the conviction
to do what they wanted,

1271
01:18:45,680 --> 01:18:49,040
even knowing that their family and guests
would not warmly received the whole

1272
01:18:49,041 --> 01:18:53,660
jibberish chanting and
bloodletting. Okay. So there you go.

1273
01:18:54,380 --> 01:18:58,910
Having the balls to fucking annoyed
everyone in your family. Um,

1274
01:18:59,030 --> 01:19:01,730
and other quick thing, here's some
people are traveling to Boston.

1275
01:19:01,730 --> 01:19:04,820
They know that I grew up there and I also
fucking travel around the country and

1276
01:19:04,821 --> 01:19:09,050
this guy said, hey bill, I'm going there
with my wife. She used to, she, um,

1277
01:19:09,500 --> 01:19:13,400
she used to live there, but I would also,
uh, you know, so she knows where to go.

1278
01:19:13,401 --> 01:19:14,181
I'd like to know,
you know,

1279
01:19:14,181 --> 01:19:18,060
have you tell me where to fuck the
gum paraphrasing obviously. Um,

1280
01:19:18,061 --> 01:19:21,020
I haven't lived there
since 1995 dudes. So, um,

1281
01:19:21,940 --> 01:19:25,280
I'm going to try to tell you to go to
some of my favorite places from a back in

1282
01:19:25,281 --> 01:19:26,270
the day.
I would start,

1283
01:19:26,271 --> 01:19:30,710
go to [inaudible] liquors on route
one in saga right before, you know,

1284
01:19:31,400 --> 01:19:36,400
get a good six pack and you maybe
some Michelob and then go up to the,

1285
01:19:36,980 --> 01:19:39,410
uh, go up to the cow alone.
Get some fucking Chinese food.

1286
01:19:42,470 --> 01:19:44,750
And of course another great
liquor store out in, uh,

1287
01:19:44,751 --> 01:19:47,270
out in the Boston areas out in Brockton,
Massachusetts.

1288
01:19:47,271 --> 01:19:50,240
Go to Blanchard's liquor store.
I'll buy the West Gate Mall.

1289
01:19:50,241 --> 01:19:53,060
You might want to check if that's still
there, but I know the bowling alley is,

1290
01:19:53,600 --> 01:19:54,920
that's a great place.
You know,

1291
01:19:54,950 --> 01:19:59,240
go out there and put on some flock of
seagulls and try to talk to some chick

1292
01:19:59,241 --> 01:20:00,470
with way too much.
Uh,

1293
01:20:01,100 --> 01:20:04,430
who drew a triangle of
pink on both of her cheeks?

1294
01:20:05,470 --> 01:20:08,220
I'm just fucking with you. The
penalty. Go to a Bruins game.

1295
01:20:08,221 --> 01:20:12,780
Go and stop by the penalty box. That's
a good bar. It's really alcohol based.

1296
01:20:12,781 --> 01:20:17,490
Stay away from the freedom trail.
Okay. Stay away from the freedom trail.

1297
01:20:17,610 --> 01:20:21,990
I don't know about you guys, but there's
nothing more boring to me anyways.

1298
01:20:22,260 --> 01:20:26,580
Then the revolutionary war. It
is mind numbingly boring. Uh,

1299
01:20:26,581 --> 01:20:28,830
with the old weaponry.
It's like, you know,

1300
01:20:28,860 --> 01:20:33,360
it's like the original Atari after you
saw this playstation shit we've been

1301
01:20:33,361 --> 01:20:37,020
doing for the last, you know, 50
years. So, oh, you hear that shit?

1302
01:20:37,200 --> 01:20:41,390
Did she sing it again?
Wait a second. Wait for it.

1303
01:20:42,590 --> 01:20:43,910
Not The fucking game.
The violin.

1304
01:20:47,330 --> 01:20:48,680
Can you hear it?
Probably can't fucking hear.

1305
01:20:49,200 --> 01:20:50,033
No,
I

1306
01:20:50,890 --> 01:20:54,790
blah blah, blah, blah. All right. Um, oh,

1307
01:20:54,910 --> 01:20:56,290
when somebody sent me something,

1308
01:20:56,410 --> 01:20:58,000
and this is the last thing
I'll tell you guys before I'll,

1309
01:20:58,001 --> 01:21:00,370
I'll tell you all to have a good
fucking week as I always do.

1310
01:21:00,910 --> 01:21:03,520
Trying to add on a nice
positive note. Uh, hey,

1311
01:21:03,521 --> 01:21:06,670
let me hit refresh here just to see who
won this food's one in this fucking game.

1312
01:21:07,450 --> 01:21:11,410
Come on, refresh Jesus Christ.

1313
01:21:11,980 --> 01:21:15,160
He isn't it unbelievable how quickly
you fucking computer gets old.

1314
01:21:15,700 --> 01:21:19,090
It's like cool for the first fucking
week and then you download a couple of

1315
01:21:19,091 --> 01:21:20,770
things and then it's like,
you know,

1316
01:21:21,400 --> 01:21:24,430
it's like Brad Pitt at the beginning of
that movie where he played the old baby.

1317
01:21:25,450 --> 01:21:26,470
Anybody see that movie?

1318
01:21:26,471 --> 01:21:31,000
I don't think I've ever laughed so fucking
hard in my life when that guy came in

1319
01:21:31,001 --> 01:21:33,940
and he was trying to get some pussy
and he hears and he looks down,

1320
01:21:34,030 --> 01:21:35,200
there was that little old baby.

1321
01:21:36,500 --> 01:21:39,460
You want to talk about killing a
fucking a woman's, a guy's libido.

1322
01:21:40,870 --> 01:21:44,260
The fuck is going on with my computer.
I didn't have the thing.

1323
01:21:44,290 --> 01:21:46,300
I actually have dial up right now.
You can believe it.

1324
01:21:46,301 --> 01:21:49,570
That's probably another one of the
problems are right. Here we go. Come on.

1325
01:21:49,840 --> 01:21:54,490
Come on. You fucking cunts.
Two to one. Pittsburg,

1326
01:21:54,580 --> 01:21:57,910
eight oh four left. I like it
though. I forget the name of the guy,

1327
01:21:57,911 --> 01:21:59,080
but we have a new defense man.

1328
01:21:59,081 --> 01:22:01,840
Maybe that'll help us to make up for
the fact that we don't have Phil Kessel

1329
01:22:01,841 --> 01:22:05,350
anymore even though for some reason a
lot of people don't like him. So anyways,

1330
01:22:05,351 --> 01:22:07,030
this guy sent me this last thing.
I'll read you guys.

1331
01:22:07,031 --> 01:22:08,710
This guy sent me something about a,

1332
01:22:08,711 --> 01:22:11,890
you know I was talking about when you
going to go buy things and people ask for

1333
01:22:11,891 --> 01:22:16,510
your phone number and all this fucking
information and it fucking creeps me out.

1334
01:22:16,720 --> 01:22:17,740
Every time they do that,

1335
01:22:17,770 --> 01:22:20,770
I just think that they should play in
the beginning of that iron main song,

1336
01:22:20,771 --> 01:22:21,604
the prisoner,

1337
01:22:21,640 --> 01:22:23,800
he remembered that from the eighties
do you remember how that thing went?

1338
01:22:28,840 --> 01:22:29,673
You remember this

1339
01:22:32,970 --> 01:22:36,360
then new number two was number one.

1340
01:22:37,920 --> 01:22:40,920
You are number six most cycle laugh ever.

1341
01:22:50,720 --> 01:22:52,010
Can you imagine if your fucking dad,

1342
01:22:52,011 --> 01:22:56,660
you would laugh at you like
that back in the day. Be like,

1343
01:22:57,110 --> 01:23:00,890
son, how many beers did you have the
night? You're just like, I just had to

1344
01:23:04,600 --> 01:23:07,990
all right, he just fucking Dallas in the
light start and it's going to be over.

1345
01:23:08,140 --> 01:23:11,470
So anyways, this fucking guy. Does that
make any sense by the way? I don't know.

1346
01:23:11,471 --> 01:23:13,030
I'm fucking sitting here
with one microphone.

1347
01:23:13,031 --> 01:23:17,110
No headphones in a fucking hotel
room. This is what you get. All right,

1348
01:23:17,740 --> 01:23:19,840
so this guy and said,
Bill,

1349
01:23:19,841 --> 01:23:22,750
can you believe how much
fucking information people
are willing to give away for

1350
01:23:22,751 --> 01:23:25,690
no to strangers for no reason.
He goes,

1351
01:23:25,691 --> 01:23:28,450
I got my haircut the other day and
the first thing they say to me before,

1352
01:23:28,451 --> 01:23:33,160
hello or what can I do for you is the
first thing out of the gate is what's your

1353
01:23:33,161 --> 01:23:38,050
phone number? So I say, why do you
need my phone number? She says,

1354
01:23:38,170 --> 01:23:40,330
so we know who you are when you come in.

1355
01:23:41,560 --> 01:23:44,460
Which is bullshit because they
don't know you when you come in.

1356
01:23:44,490 --> 01:23:46,750
They still have to ask what
your goddamn number is.

1357
01:23:46,990 --> 01:23:51,430
C got to love someone who actually fucking
uses their brain. So anyway, she goes,

1358
01:23:51,460 --> 01:23:53,470
he says,
I don't want to give you my number.

1359
01:23:53,920 --> 01:23:57,490
So then she scarfs in his face and says,

1360
01:23:58,030 --> 01:24:00,370
we don't stand the
information out to anyone.

1361
01:24:00,371 --> 01:24:04,390
It's just to keep track of
you here. That's it. Um,

1362
01:24:04,510 --> 01:24:07,960
and then she says, uh, then
okay, then the guy says,

1363
01:24:08,060 --> 01:24:09,700
he the Guy Rick wrote
this really badly here.

1364
01:24:10,090 --> 01:24:12,910
So then I guess he responds to that
doesn't make me feel any better.

1365
01:24:12,911 --> 01:24:15,040
You don't need my phone
number to cut my hair.

1366
01:24:15,310 --> 01:24:18,340
Then there's slag does this fine,

1367
01:24:18,341 --> 01:24:22,870
whatever that sounded exactly like your
exaggerated impression of a dumb broad.

1368
01:24:23,050 --> 01:24:27,580
Then she goes, how about your
address too? This is fucking,

1369
01:24:27,790 --> 01:24:31,780
you know what all these corporations are
sharing this information to figure out

1370
01:24:31,781 --> 01:24:36,280
exactly what you buy when you buy it,
what you liked the best.

1371
01:24:37,000 --> 01:24:40,690
So they can just fucking, I
don't know what, you know,

1372
01:24:41,830 --> 01:24:46,660
Jack, the prices of the
shit up. So anyways, um, she
goes, how about your address?

1373
01:24:46,720 --> 01:24:50,590
And the guy goes, what are you going to
do? Drop the haircut off at my house.

1374
01:24:50,620 --> 01:24:53,650
Just cut my fucking,
ah,

1375
01:24:53,910 --> 01:24:57,430
now there's three people in line behind
me in this worthless tub of come.

1376
01:24:57,460 --> 01:25:02,020
Jesus leans around me and says, and
says, I guess to the people behind them.

1377
01:25:02,200 --> 01:25:06,370
Sorry. This takes longer when they,
then he writes, they, you know,

1378
01:25:06,550 --> 01:25:11,500
don't give any information and
then he says sarcastically. Oh,

1379
01:25:11,501 --> 01:25:12,130
I see.

1380
01:25:12,130 --> 01:25:16,180
I'm the one compliment a complicating
this transaction and it's not even her

1381
01:25:16,181 --> 01:25:18,910
fault. It's her. Oh, and
it's not even her fault.

1382
01:25:18,911 --> 01:25:22,210
It's her corporate creep bosses and all
the fucking sheep that let people do

1383
01:25:22,211 --> 01:25:26,170
whatever they want. Sorry,
this is so long. Well,

1384
01:25:26,230 --> 01:25:28,870
you should apologize to my listeners
because they had to listen to me read it.

1385
01:25:28,870 --> 01:25:31,300
Yeah, man. Don't give those
people your fucking phone numbers.

1386
01:25:31,301 --> 01:25:35,500
Don't give him your address. I do that.
Can we get your phone number? I had. No,

1387
01:25:35,501 --> 01:25:39,460
you can't. We're not going to do anything
with it. That's fine. That's fine.

1388
01:25:39,610 --> 01:25:41,110
I know you're not going
to do anything with it.

1389
01:25:41,111 --> 01:25:42,310
I don't want you to have my phone number.

1390
01:25:43,300 --> 01:25:45,610
We need to call me up and see
how my fucking haircuts going.

1391
01:25:46,390 --> 01:25:48,880
Is it still short and you
think you need an adjustment?

1392
01:25:49,630 --> 01:25:53,320
Did I tell you that story?
But when I went into cvs and that guy who,

1393
01:25:53,540 --> 01:25:57,400
look what the peewee Herman Haircut, there
was two, two foreigners in front of me,

1394
01:25:57,401 --> 01:25:58,780
they barely spoke English and they,

1395
01:25:58,960 --> 01:26:02,440
he asked if they want to one of those
savy saved cards and they said no.

1396
01:26:02,710 --> 01:26:05,390
And he goes, that's all right, I'll
just scan one anyways. And he scans it.

1397
01:26:06,410 --> 01:26:08,150
So I walk up and I'm ready for this guy.
He goes,

1398
01:26:08,151 --> 01:26:11,610
do you have our little savy safe car? And
I say, no, I don't. And he goes, well,

1399
01:26:11,660 --> 01:26:13,850
I'll just scan it anyways. And I
got, no, I don't want you doing.

1400
01:26:13,920 --> 01:26:17,810
And then he scanned it and I said, I said,
excuse me, what did I just say to you?

1401
01:26:18,860 --> 01:26:22,520
I just said, I don't want that. And you
scan it anyways. Why did you just do that?

1402
01:26:22,850 --> 01:26:25,640
And he goes, it's all right. I want
scan it, I'll scan it. And I go, what?

1403
01:26:25,730 --> 01:26:30,640
What do you get? Like half a cent for
every person that you get. You know that,

1404
01:26:30,720 --> 01:26:35,120
that, that you get on the fucking list
there and he goes, no, I don't. It's like,

1405
01:26:35,121 --> 01:26:38,240
really? Is that why he can't
make eye contact with me?
You fucking piece of shit.

1406
01:26:38,390 --> 01:26:43,280
He probably didn't even unscattered
the Goddamn thing, you know?

1407
01:26:43,370 --> 01:26:46,070
I don't understand people that help
out corporations. I just don't,

1408
01:26:46,071 --> 01:26:50,270
have they done anything to demonstrate
that they give a flying fuck about you or

1409
01:26:50,271 --> 01:26:53,570
the drinking water in your town?
Don't help those cons. I mean,

1410
01:26:53,571 --> 01:26:55,670
you can if you want to, but
that's just, I would just,

1411
01:26:56,180 --> 01:26:59,900
I think it would be a better world if
these fucking pricks didn't know every

1412
01:27:00,380 --> 01:27:01,820
goddamn thing about you.
You know?

1413
01:27:01,821 --> 01:27:04,700
Pretty soon you're going to walk in there
and they're going to fucking asked if

1414
01:27:04,790 --> 01:27:05,780
you can put a did it.

1415
01:27:05,860 --> 01:27:09,500
They can just bug you like gene
Hackman in the conversation. Right.

1416
01:27:10,390 --> 01:27:12,530
All right dude, I don't know what the
fuck I'm talking about. You know what?

1417
01:27:12,680 --> 01:27:14,870
I'm going to go down and Melissa,
this lady singer songs,

1418
01:27:15,230 --> 01:27:18,380
so I don't have to think there's
a nice little crowd down there.

1419
01:27:19,200 --> 01:27:21,170
Has got to be at least
26 people down there,

1420
01:27:21,200 --> 01:27:25,160
which I think in downtown San
Jose actually constitutes a mob.

1421
01:27:26,000 --> 01:27:28,880
Maybe somebody will get tased and shot
in the abdomen. I don't know what.

1422
01:27:29,000 --> 01:27:32,420
All right, that's the podcast
for this week. Thank you
guys so much for listening.

1423
01:27:32,450 --> 01:27:36,830
I am currently revamping my website and
I hope that everything's going to be up

1424
01:27:36,831 --> 01:27:41,690
to speed. I recently went over
10,000 people on my mailing list,

1425
01:27:41,691 --> 01:27:45,530
so I'm really excited about that. And,
uh, if you want to know what's going on,

1426
01:27:45,980 --> 01:27:47,960
you know, especially
like, you see, you know,

1427
01:27:48,800 --> 01:27:52,730
when I switched over to a lipsin with
the podcast and all that fucking shit,

1428
01:27:53,360 --> 01:27:55,970
if you were out of the loop, it's
because you weren't on my mailing list.

1429
01:27:55,971 --> 01:27:58,940
I'm not sure. You know how funny
is this? How funny is this? Uh,

1430
01:27:58,941 --> 01:28:01,640
how fucking hypocritical and Mike,
I just said,

1431
01:28:01,641 --> 01:28:03,080
don't give you phone number out to these

1432
01:28:03,520 --> 01:28:07,680
Hans. And now here I am asking for
your web address. I wrote 20 people.

1433
01:28:08,620 --> 01:28:09,453
All right,
I'll stop.

1434
01:28:30,760 --> 01:28:31,593
[inaudible]

1435
01:29:01,890 --> 01:29:01,890
[inaudible].
