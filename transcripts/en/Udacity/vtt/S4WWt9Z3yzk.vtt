00:00:00.580 --> 00:00:04.520
So, my name is Kelly Chen. I consider myself a Bay

00:00:04.520 --> 00:00:07.830
Area native. I grew up in Fremont, and I'm a Genetic

00:00:07.830 --> 00:00:11.990
Counselor. And technically, I guess my title is Perinatal Genetic Counselor.

00:00:11.990 --> 00:00:15.690
So I focus on patients who are pregnant or thinking about pregnancy.

00:00:15.690 --> 00:00:19.620
&gt;&gt; And as a Genetic Counselor, are there sub disciplines like, I mean are

00:00:19.620 --> 00:00:21.970
there Genetic Counselors who focus on sort

00:00:21.970 --> 00:00:25.690
of the non perinatal aspect? Certainly, so this

00:00:25.690 --> 00:00:27.210
profession is still pretty new. I think in

00:00:27.210 --> 00:00:29.575
the beginning, there weren't that many specialties. It was

00:00:29.575 --> 00:00:33.517
either pediatrics children, and, and prenatal was the second

00:00:33.517 --> 00:00:36.732
I think, as, as soon as pregnancy tests started.

00:00:36.732 --> 00:00:39.880
And since then, there are several specialties. The big

00:00:39.880 --> 00:00:43.740
ones are pediatrics, prenatal, cancer has become the hot

00:00:43.740 --> 00:00:47.498
new thing. counselors who work in a laboratory. And

00:00:47.498 --> 00:00:50.858
then specialty counselors, who work in certain disciplines like

00:00:50.858 --> 00:00:52.548
cardiology, or neurology, or.

00:00:52.548 --> 00:00:55.265
&gt;&gt; I see. And what are the, what are the various backgrounds? Do all

00:00:55.265 --> 00:00:57.876
genetic counselors have the same academic training?

00:00:57.876 --> 00:01:00.415
Or, or, do they have diverse academic training?

00:01:00.415 --> 00:01:04.560
&gt;&gt; So, yeah. So, counselors come from a wide variety

00:01:04.560 --> 00:01:07.840
of backgrounds. they do have in common that they have

00:01:07.840 --> 00:01:11.223
to have a masters degree. And the Masters degree programs

00:01:11.223 --> 00:01:15.900
require an undergraduate, usually 4 year college. But, and some prerequisite

00:01:15.900 --> 00:01:19.690
science courses, biology, chemistry. but other than that you can

00:01:19.690 --> 00:01:22.880
be any major. So, my classmate was a psychology major.

00:01:22.880 --> 00:01:26.810
I was a genetics major. some people were completely not

00:01:26.810 --> 00:01:29.530
really into either specialty as long as they finish their courses.

00:01:29.530 --> 00:01:31.240
&gt;&gt; And did you always know you wanted to be

00:01:31.240 --> 00:01:35.060
a genetic counselor, or was this a later decision or?

00:01:35.060 --> 00:01:38.780
&gt;&gt; So, it's very interesting. I'll tell you this story, and I like

00:01:38.780 --> 00:01:41.100
to share it when I give talks, that I didn't find out about

00:01:41.100 --> 00:01:43.850
genetic counseling until about a year after I graduated

00:01:43.850 --> 00:01:48.200
from undergrad. I went to UC Berkeley, and I knew

00:01:48.200 --> 00:01:50.420
I liked science, and I really liked genetics. So

00:01:50.420 --> 00:01:54.210
I was a genetics major. And at that time, when

00:01:54.210 --> 00:01:56.940
I was going to school, the main option was

00:01:56.940 --> 00:01:59.490
to be like a physician. And there wasn't many other

00:01:59.490 --> 00:02:02.930
allied health care positions. And so, when I found out

00:02:02.930 --> 00:02:06.580
that that wasn't really what was my career path I

00:02:06.580 --> 00:02:08.660
decided to go into something totally different for a couple of

00:02:08.660 --> 00:02:12.750
years. it was only after I was really, after I had graduated,

00:02:12.750 --> 00:02:16.050
unpacked my boxes from college, that I picked up a brochure

00:02:16.050 --> 00:02:19.940
about genetic counseling. And that's how I found out about the profession.

00:02:19.940 --> 00:02:21.110
&gt;&gt; Wow.

00:02:21.110 --> 00:02:24.820
&gt;&gt; I just find it ironic just because UC Berkeley

00:02:24.820 --> 00:02:27.560
had one of the oldest genetic counseling prog, training programs

00:02:27.560 --> 00:02:29.335
at that point. They were probably, like in the first

00:02:29.335 --> 00:02:31.970
four. So it had been going on for 20, 30 years.

00:02:31.970 --> 00:02:33.460
And when I was an undergrad, I had no

00:02:33.460 --> 00:02:37.880
exposure or or knowledge about the program. And so, now

00:02:37.880 --> 00:02:39.330
I feel like every time I get a chance

00:02:39.330 --> 00:02:41.670
to give back, I, I like to promote the profession.

00:02:41.670 --> 00:02:44.720
&gt;&gt; Nice. What kind of training was involved, so once you figured out

00:02:44.720 --> 00:02:46.560
that's something you wanted. what do you

00:02:46.560 --> 00:02:48.550
do to become a genetic counselor officially?

00:02:48.550 --> 00:02:52.000
&gt;&gt; So, it's very specific. So it's usually a 2 or 3 year master's

00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:54.990
program. specifically in genetic counseling. So, all

00:02:54.990 --> 00:02:57.260
the courses are geared towards the science

00:02:57.260 --> 00:03:00.992
of genetics and counseling theory. And so, right now, I just did this

00:03:00.992 --> 00:03:01.514
[UNKNOWN],

00:03:01.514 --> 00:03:06.220
I think there are about 30 programs nationwide. So there are three in

00:03:06.220 --> 00:03:10.470
California and in other states. And so you still have to apply, take

00:03:10.470 --> 00:03:12.930
standard testing like GRE's, they're still

00:03:12.930 --> 00:03:16.480
around. And do some training like volunteering

00:03:16.480 --> 00:03:19.770
in health care settings. So I volunteered to planned parenthood for a year.

00:03:19.770 --> 00:03:20.210
&gt;&gt; I see.

00:03:20.210 --> 00:03:21.380
&gt;&gt; Doing the pregnancy tests.

00:03:21.380 --> 00:03:21.900
&gt;&gt; Cool.

00:03:21.900 --> 00:03:23.550
&gt;&gt; And then applied.

00:03:23.550 --> 00:03:25.110
&gt;&gt; Are there different certifications for different

00:03:25.110 --> 00:03:26.550
States. Like if you get trained in

00:03:26.550 --> 00:03:28.580
one State. If you're in the United States, would do

00:03:28.580 --> 00:03:31.160
have an international audience? But if you're in the United States,

00:03:31.160 --> 00:03:33.720
if you get certified, or get your degree, are you

00:03:33.720 --> 00:03:36.470
able to move and, and, and be a genetic couselor in

00:03:36.470 --> 00:03:40.112
any State? That's a really good question. So, the certification

00:03:40.112 --> 00:03:43.490
and, and the accreditation process for genetic counselors has changed. It

00:03:43.490 --> 00:03:47.810
used to be a certificate issued by a national organization,

00:03:47.810 --> 00:03:49.330
through our national organization called

00:03:49.330 --> 00:03:52.380
National Society of Genetic Counseling. and

00:03:52.380 --> 00:03:56.620
then, just probably in the past 5, 6 years, many of the states

00:03:56.620 --> 00:04:00.640
pushed for licensure so that we have a license, just like any other healthcare

00:04:00.640 --> 00:04:04.300
professional, dog groomer, hair dresser. Which

00:04:04.300 --> 00:04:06.420
would open up opportunities for billing and

00:04:06.420 --> 00:04:08.520
for status, and things. So, this states

00:04:08.520 --> 00:04:11.670
just started issuing licenses 4 years ago.

00:04:11.670 --> 00:04:14.760
&gt;&gt; I see. What do you think about the profession itself

00:04:14.760 --> 00:04:18.230
overall? Is it, is it a profession that's growing in number?

00:04:18.230 --> 00:04:20.089
and, and how is it growing, if it is?

00:04:20.089 --> 00:04:23.450
&gt;&gt; So yeah, the, the profession itself definitely is

00:04:23.450 --> 00:04:25.640
growing in number. I don't have year by year,

00:04:25.640 --> 00:04:27.650
but I think, in the very beginning, I think

00:04:27.650 --> 00:04:30.390
the first national society started in the late 70s. And

00:04:30.390 --> 00:04:34.030
then there are probably 10 to 30 members maybe,

00:04:34.030 --> 00:04:37.134
and now I think we're up to past 2,000

00:04:37.134 --> 00:04:41.520
nationwise. in the state, I'm organizing this conference coming

00:04:41.520 --> 00:04:44.120
up, so I just did some stats. In this state,

00:04:44.120 --> 00:04:47.560
there's probably about 400 licensed genetic counselors. So just to give

00:04:47.560 --> 00:04:51.600
a perspective of. We're still a small specialty, but definitely growing.

00:04:51.600 --> 00:04:54.670
&gt;&gt; Is, I, I guess this so, sort of more of the

00:04:54.670 --> 00:04:58.060
personal side, but I mean, is, do you like being a genetic

00:04:58.060 --> 00:05:00.714
counselor? Do you feel like you're helping people? What, what aspect of

00:05:00.714 --> 00:05:04.460
doing this job is probably the, the best and most fulfilling for you?

00:05:04.460 --> 00:05:06.850
&gt;&gt; I think it's a combination of things. Like this

00:05:06.850 --> 00:05:09.320
job definitely, I, I really enjoy being a genetic counselor.

00:05:09.320 --> 00:05:13.320
It really fits my niche. That, it combines my

00:05:13.320 --> 00:05:16.320
interest and my love of science, and specifically genetics

00:05:16.320 --> 00:05:20.020
and genetic conditions, with seeing patients, helping people in

00:05:20.020 --> 00:05:22.520
a health care setting. So, I've been thinking about some

00:05:22.520 --> 00:05:24.610
of these answers, that you know, the traditional role

00:05:24.610 --> 00:05:27.190
for a health care professional is a doctor. But

00:05:27.190 --> 00:05:29.030
doctors have a lot of stress, a lot of

00:05:29.030 --> 00:05:34.560
schooling. doing treatments and procedures. And I wasn't necessarily interested

00:05:34.560 --> 00:05:39.070
in that part. I was really more interested in communicating to patients. And

00:05:39.070 --> 00:05:43.050
feeling like I could help them just using my words. Or just being

00:05:43.050 --> 00:05:46.810
there for them and listening to them. So, I really feel that this

00:05:46.810 --> 00:05:51.080
profession has been a really good fit, for, for, for me and my personality.

00:05:51.080 --> 00:05:52.090
&gt;&gt; That's great.

00:05:52.090 --> 00:05:52.360
&gt;&gt; Yeah.

00:05:52.360 --> 00:05:56.470
&gt;&gt; Now you said you're a perinatal genetic counselor. So walk us through,

00:05:56.470 --> 00:06:00.470
what is like? I mean who, what kind of patient comes to you, and

00:06:00.470 --> 00:06:04.520
how does the workflow process work when they seek out a genetic counselor?

00:06:04.520 --> 00:06:07.968
&gt;&gt; So, the workflow for a perinatal

00:06:07.968 --> 00:06:09.880
genetic counselor. And paranetal is actually kind

00:06:09.880 --> 00:06:14.560
of a new phrase we created at where I work. Traditionally, the word has

00:06:14.560 --> 00:06:17.180
been prenatal. So, before birth, and then

00:06:17.180 --> 00:06:20.230
there's postnatal. And now that we're doing

00:06:20.230 --> 00:06:22.920
so much intervention before birth that affects

00:06:22.920 --> 00:06:25.450
after birth, we use the combination of perinatal.

00:06:25.450 --> 00:06:27.720
So most of the patients that I

00:06:27.720 --> 00:06:31.100
see are pregnant, actively pregnant and thinking about

00:06:31.100 --> 00:06:33.180
doing some testing to check for either genetic

00:06:33.180 --> 00:06:37.060
conditions or birth defects. sometimes we see patients

00:06:37.060 --> 00:06:38.848
before they get pregnant, but they know they

00:06:38.848 --> 00:06:42.020
want to have children and know that they might

00:06:42.020 --> 00:06:45.220
be at risk for a certain condition. So,

00:06:45.220 --> 00:06:47.730
our appointments are fairly, they're like office consultations.

00:06:47.730 --> 00:06:48.050
&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.

00:06:48.050 --> 00:06:50.530
&gt;&gt; We do a little prep-work. We might contact

00:06:50.530 --> 00:06:53.200
them on the phone and get a little family history or medical

00:06:53.200 --> 00:06:57.190
history. and then our meeting with them is probably about 40 minutes, 40

00:06:57.190 --> 00:07:02.000
to 60 minutes long. and then afterwards, if we've ordered testing or there's

00:07:02.000 --> 00:07:04.860
other appointments to make. We'll follow up and, and help patients with that.

00:07:04.860 --> 00:07:07.330
&gt;&gt; I'm really curious about the, the testing. So

00:07:07.330 --> 00:07:09.130
do patients come to you and say, I want to

00:07:09.130 --> 00:07:14.330
know what's in my genes or what I pass on, and you guys do a test for them?

00:07:14.330 --> 00:07:15.930
&gt;&gt; Yeah. So I think our patients

00:07:15.930 --> 00:07:18.430
are a little biased. I mean, I'm sure there, it seems

00:07:18.430 --> 00:07:20.720
like there, there are certainly patients out there who would say,

00:07:20.720 --> 00:07:22.710
or people out there who would say they don't want to

00:07:22.710 --> 00:07:25.720
learn, know their genetic status. And those patients we never end up

00:07:25.720 --> 00:07:29.470
seeing, because they would just decline an appointment with us. So

00:07:29.470 --> 00:07:32.110
those that we do see definitely are interested in some kind

00:07:32.110 --> 00:07:35.670
of genetic information. Whether it's for themselves or primarily for their

00:07:35.670 --> 00:07:39.520
pregnancy, or their future child. so,

00:07:39.520 --> 00:07:41.270
yeah. So, sometimes there's something specific

00:07:41.270 --> 00:07:44.710
in the family that we're looking for. We've had some patients just say, test

00:07:44.710 --> 00:07:46.840
me for everything, I want to know everything.

00:07:46.840 --> 00:07:48.920
And we have to explain the science and

00:07:48.920 --> 00:07:53.190
technology's not quite there yet. And so we're trying to pin point, what can we

00:07:53.190 --> 00:07:56.460
offer you? Accurate testing, specific testing, something

00:07:56.460 --> 00:07:59.550
that will be helpful to you. So, yeah.

00:07:59.550 --> 00:08:02.260
&gt;&gt; And what kind of what do you think about this sort of

00:08:02.260 --> 00:08:06.368
new wave of personal genetics, and, and companies that are able to you

00:08:06.368 --> 00:08:09.020
know, get samples from individuals and, and,

00:08:09.020 --> 00:08:11.160
and look at genes for them. How does,

00:08:11.160 --> 00:08:14.970
how does that fit in with this whole process of, of patients coming to you.

00:08:14.970 --> 00:08:19.450
&gt;&gt; Right. So, this whole wave of personal genomics they've

00:08:19.450 --> 00:08:24.010
called it. it's a, it's a separate court category by itself.

00:08:24.010 --> 00:08:28.450
And hasn't quite crossed in the penal realm yet. But,

00:08:28.450 --> 00:08:31.130
I mean, we certainly hear about it indirectly from our colleagues.

00:08:32.220 --> 00:08:34.210
I think e, just with our experience with the

00:08:34.210 --> 00:08:39.049
genetic testing, a lot of genetic testing is not straightforward.

00:08:39.049 --> 00:08:41.020
Sometimes we find things and we don't know how to

00:08:41.020 --> 00:08:45.780
interpret. And so, the personal genomics, I think is a,

00:08:45.780 --> 00:08:48.390
exciting new field. But also, as with any new

00:08:48.390 --> 00:08:52.890
test comes with limitation. And you know, those of us

00:08:52.890 --> 00:08:55.190
in the community of genetic counselors, some are very supportive

00:08:55.190 --> 00:08:57.320
of that technology. Some of us are still a little

00:08:57.320 --> 00:09:00.110
hesitant and cautious about, is it more harmful

00:09:00.110 --> 00:09:03.090
and helpful to start looking for things that

00:09:03.090 --> 00:09:05.660
may not have a co, complete answer to,

00:09:05.660 --> 00:09:08.000
like opening up Pandora's box kind of thing.

00:09:08.000 --> 00:09:12.030
&gt;&gt; Can you give me any examples, any specific examples of traits like that

00:09:12.030 --> 00:09:16.100
that you think are, you know, make it more difficult to really understand. Like

00:09:16.100 --> 00:09:19.420
is there a particular kind of dilemma, or is the patient ever come to

00:09:19.420 --> 00:09:22.340
you, or you felt you were in a situation where you were giving them information

00:09:22.340 --> 00:09:24.160
that they couldn't do anything with anyhow?

00:09:24.160 --> 00:09:27.710
&gt;&gt; Yeah, so there's, there's actually, so, I

00:09:27.710 --> 00:09:29.770
have a few examples. So one, one example

00:09:29.770 --> 00:09:31.720
of a test that's not straightforward, that kind

00:09:31.720 --> 00:09:34.540
of gives us a little difficulty in counseling, is

00:09:34.540 --> 00:09:37.690
maybe for a condition like hemochromatosis. So, that's

00:09:37.690 --> 00:09:40.290
an adult type onset condition, where you don't have

00:09:40.290 --> 00:09:43.229
symptoms until you reach adulthood, and it causes

00:09:44.300 --> 00:09:47.500
iron storage or overload. It can be treated fairly

00:09:47.500 --> 00:09:50.778
easily, but it does need treatment. the issue with

00:09:50.778 --> 00:09:53.040
the genetics of it is that there is a

00:09:53.040 --> 00:09:56.550
gene or two genes associated with the condition, but

00:09:56.550 --> 00:09:59.380
the gene is not the full picture. So people

00:09:59.380 --> 00:10:01.680
who have changes in the gene don't always have

00:10:01.680 --> 00:10:04.400
the condition. and so I think there's a lot

00:10:04.400 --> 00:10:08.880
of conditions like that. Alzheimer's, high cholesterol levels, where

00:10:08.880 --> 00:10:12.630
you identify a gene but it's not 100% correlation that

00:10:12.630 --> 00:10:17.040
that gene change always causes symptoms. And then you're left with not

00:10:17.040 --> 00:10:21.670
the co, not the whole picture, and you're giving probabilities. And so then

00:10:21.670 --> 00:10:25.290
the issue becomes, is that helpful to know about, know about a

00:10:25.290 --> 00:10:28.980
possibility that you may or may not be able to change or treat?

00:10:28.980 --> 00:10:29.503
&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.

00:10:29.503 --> 00:10:33.610
&gt;&gt; So that's been I think the big dilemma. The ethical dilemma is, some people

00:10:33.610 --> 00:10:37.710
would say I'd still want to know, because I want to prepare myself and try to

00:10:37.710 --> 00:10:39.630
do as much prevention as possible.

00:10:39.630 --> 00:10:40.290
&gt;&gt; Sure.

00:10:40.290 --> 00:10:43.110
&gt;&gt; Other people would say, well, if it's not for sure, I'm going to be left

00:10:43.110 --> 00:10:48.500
worrying and, and I'd rather just take it as it comes. So I think that's the big

00:10:48.500 --> 00:10:50.980
issue with the new genetic te, technologies in

00:10:50.980 --> 00:10:53.100
general. Whether it's looking for a trait or

00:10:53.100 --> 00:10:56.000
a specific condition that, most of the testing

00:10:56.000 --> 00:10:59.910
right now is not 100, 100% accurate or specific.

00:10:59.910 --> 00:11:01.120
&gt;&gt; Right. It sounds like a lot of what

00:11:01.120 --> 00:11:03.250
you end up doing as well as sort of education,

00:11:03.250 --> 00:11:07.956
patient education of traits and testing, and how to interpret various results.

00:11:07.956 --> 00:11:12.470
&gt;&gt; Definitely. So, a lot of what I do is I think of it as a

00:11:12.470 --> 00:11:16.020
consultation, but also just providing information. I see

00:11:16.020 --> 00:11:19.810
us as a link between physicians and patients, that

00:11:19.810 --> 00:11:22.570
traditionally doctors order tests that are fairly straightforward

00:11:22.570 --> 00:11:24.930
like a blood count. Or a blood type,

00:11:24.930 --> 00:11:26.790
or something like that. And they can easily

00:11:26.790 --> 00:11:28.980
tell a patient what that means in a sentence.

00:11:28.980 --> 00:11:31.650
With this genetic testing, it's much more complicated than

00:11:31.650 --> 00:11:34.910
that. it's not always a straightforward yes or no, and

00:11:34.910 --> 00:11:38.450
doctors don't have time to spend with patients explaining that.

00:11:38.450 --> 00:11:40.770
And so I see us as a bridge between that.

00:11:40.770 --> 00:11:44.420
Being able to help patients decipher and interpret this information.

00:11:44.420 --> 00:11:47.230
And then also helping them make decisions based on those

00:11:47.230 --> 00:11:50.390
results. because a lot of decisions to be made, especially

00:11:50.390 --> 00:11:54.340
in pregnancy, are not always medical decisions, they're personal decisions

00:11:54.340 --> 00:11:57.210
about what patients want to do about information, about

00:11:57.210 --> 00:12:01.400
their future offspring. so, so prenatal specifically is an

00:12:01.400 --> 00:12:04.260
interesting ethical realm, because we're also dealing with pregnancy

00:12:04.260 --> 00:12:07.640
and, and termination. What's the most difficult aspect of

00:12:07.640 --> 00:12:09.620
that if I can ask. is it, is it

00:12:09.620 --> 00:12:13.600
patients actually you know, deciding about you know, continuing

00:12:13.600 --> 00:12:17.780
the pregnancy versus not? are there significant traits that

00:12:17.780 --> 00:12:19.420
they have to deal with? I just, I'm looking

00:12:19.420 --> 00:12:21.150
for some kind of idea when it, when it does

00:12:21.150 --> 00:12:24.020
get gray as far as the difficult part of the job.

00:12:24.020 --> 00:12:25.800
&gt;&gt; Yeah, so, yeah, no you bring up a good

00:12:25.800 --> 00:12:27.880
point. I actually hadn't thought about that before. One of the

00:12:27.880 --> 00:12:31.290
difficulties in the job, in what I do with pregnancy

00:12:31.290 --> 00:12:35.890
is, we're not always we're, we're certainly talking about genetic testing.

00:12:35.890 --> 00:12:36.170
&gt;&gt; Sure.

00:12:36.170 --> 00:12:38.300
&gt;&gt; Sometimes, we're dealing with other kinds

00:12:38.300 --> 00:12:40.460
of tests in pregnancy, like ultrasounds. So,

00:12:40.460 --> 00:12:44.710
a video picture of the baby. Where you see a physical problem that might

00:12:44.710 --> 00:12:48.040
be something that suggests a genetic condition like Down Syndrome, or

00:12:48.040 --> 00:12:52.890
something else. And seeing the physical problem doesn't guarantee what the

00:12:52.890 --> 00:12:55.500
outcomes going to be. And so that is one difficulty in

00:12:55.500 --> 00:12:58.150
prenatal, that you don't have a live person in front of you

00:12:58.150 --> 00:13:01.260
to say, oh, this person is actually fine. Maybe they have

00:13:01.260 --> 00:13:04.770
an extra finger or toe, but they're otherwise healthy. In a

00:13:04.770 --> 00:13:07.120
pregnancy, you don't, you don't have that baby in front of

00:13:07.120 --> 00:13:10.140
you, and you can't check if there's other things going on. So

00:13:10.140 --> 00:13:12.690
I think that definitely is one difficult aspect

00:13:12.690 --> 00:13:16.250
of what I do specifically. and I would just

00:13:16.250 --> 00:13:18.190
say in general, just dealing with pregnant patients

00:13:18.190 --> 00:13:22.130
is tough. Pregnancy is a time limited event, so

00:13:22.130 --> 00:13:24.290
I feel like of all the specialties in

00:13:24.290 --> 00:13:27.160
genetic counseling, prenatal is usually the one the, the

00:13:27.160 --> 00:13:30.540
most time sensitive. We're under deadlines for scheduling

00:13:30.540 --> 00:13:35.400
appointments, seeing patients, test results. and just the anxiety

00:13:35.400 --> 00:13:38.550
of the patients themselves. They also have the hormone issues to deal with.

00:13:38.550 --> 00:13:38.683
&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.

00:13:38.683 --> 00:13:40.830
&gt;&gt; It's a very emotional time. So it can

00:13:40.830 --> 00:13:43.400
be quite challenging, but it also can be quite satisfying.

00:13:43.400 --> 00:13:45.075
&gt;&gt; Sure. Actually there is an interest

00:13:45.075 --> 00:13:45.130
[UNKNOWN]

00:13:45.130 --> 00:13:47.380
haven't thought of either. I mean I guess and, and

00:13:47.380 --> 00:13:49.630
it's portrayed in the media, at least maybe in TV

00:13:49.630 --> 00:13:52.380
and movies to a certain extent. That you know, these

00:13:52.380 --> 00:13:57.790
kinds of, this kind of information or even services for reproductive

00:13:57.790 --> 00:14:00.010
services, I, I don't know the best way to, to

00:14:00.010 --> 00:14:04.000
say that. for couples, it's generally considered more of a middle

00:14:04.000 --> 00:14:07.930
to upper class sort of information thing. It's this what,

00:14:07.930 --> 00:14:10.180
what, what is that like in the genetic counseling. What I

00:14:10.180 --> 00:14:12.800
mean, do, is it something that only certain

00:14:12.800 --> 00:14:16.440
couples end up doing, because you know, their

00:14:16.440 --> 00:14:18.060
by, you know, I actually don't know the

00:14:18.060 --> 00:14:19.460
best way to phrase this question. But you

00:14:19.460 --> 00:14:24.180
know, is, is, is access to this sort of across the board for all types? What's

00:14:24.180 --> 00:14:26.490
the general demographic of people who are sort

00:14:26.490 --> 00:14:28.840
of taking part of trying to find this information?

00:14:28.840 --> 00:14:32.490
&gt;&gt; Yeah. So, at least here in California, we're, in this Bay

00:14:32.490 --> 00:14:35.410
Area, I think we're in a unique bubble in terms of who comes

00:14:35.410 --> 00:14:38.480
to see us and access. you know, the state

00:14:38.480 --> 00:14:40.880
government has ensured that all pregnant women have some

00:14:40.880 --> 00:14:43.870
kind of medical coverage during the pregnancy. So, we're

00:14:43.870 --> 00:14:45.880
fortunate that we can see patients on the state

00:14:45.880 --> 00:14:50.620
insurance called Medi-Cal and as well as private pay

00:14:50.620 --> 00:14:53.652
patients. I think the issue, I think many patients

00:14:53.652 --> 00:14:55.835
who come see us are very appreciative of, of

00:14:55.835 --> 00:14:59.380
what we can provide, but different patients need different things.

00:14:59.380 --> 00:14:59.840
&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.

00:14:59.840 --> 00:15:00.720
&gt;&gt; So patients

00:15:00.720 --> 00:15:03.680
who are lower to middle class, or of lower

00:15:03.680 --> 00:15:06.730
education status, may not need all the explanation of the

00:15:06.730 --> 00:15:09.010
genetic testing. May be less likely to take the

00:15:09.010 --> 00:15:12.140
genetic testing. But could still benefit for meeting with us

00:15:12.140 --> 00:15:15.090
to explain all the options. so we see a

00:15:15.090 --> 00:15:19.840
huge spectrum of patients. but even in my employers group,

00:15:19.840 --> 00:15:23.040
we have different offices. So, in different cities. So

00:15:23.040 --> 00:15:25.980
the area that I'm in is, isn't an affluent area,

00:15:25.980 --> 00:15:28.890
private insurance patients are the ones I generally see.

00:15:28.890 --> 00:15:29.320
&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.

00:15:29.320 --> 00:15:33.120
&gt;&gt; Who are educated and, and know the lingo of chromosomes and, and genes.

00:15:33.120 --> 00:15:33.680
&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.

00:15:33.680 --> 00:15:37.540
&gt;&gt; versus, we have a office in the southern portion of

00:15:37.540 --> 00:15:41.240
the Bay area where there are more non-English speaking patients, patients that

00:15:41.240 --> 00:15:45.281
are on the state medical insurance. Who, who don't know what a

00:15:45.281 --> 00:15:51.040
chromosome is may not be interested in further genetic testing. So, that,

00:15:51.040 --> 00:15:53.000
yeah. Could there be a challenge, sort of dealing

00:15:53.000 --> 00:15:54.791
with different patients at the same time too? .

00:15:54.791 --> 00:15:55.350
&gt;&gt; Yeah.

00:15:55.350 --> 00:15:59.398
&gt;&gt; E, e, if it were in the same you know, practice or office too.

00:15:59.398 --> 00:16:01.300
&gt;&gt; Yeah, usually we,we find it helpful,

00:16:01.300 --> 00:16:03.370
like our group specifically will call patients, at

00:16:03.370 --> 00:16:07.210
least try to contact some patients ahead of time to see what their concerns are.

00:16:07.210 --> 00:16:10.370
So we call that a phone intake. And we find it really helpful especially for

00:16:10.370 --> 00:16:13.370
the higher end, more educated patients who have

00:16:13.370 --> 00:16:16.150
a specific agenda or specific questions they want

00:16:16.150 --> 00:16:18.980
answered to do that, do it that way.

00:16:18.980 --> 00:16:22.600
&gt;&gt; So, I'm, I'm also curious. What is, is there a common

00:16:22.600 --> 00:16:25.860
trait or condition that you counsel for the most. Like what is, what

00:16:25.860 --> 00:16:28.770
are the things that you either end up counselling for, or do

00:16:28.770 --> 00:16:31.360
people come to you and ask them, what are they most interested in?

00:16:31.360 --> 00:16:36.630
&gt;&gt; So, for my specific specialty in prenatal. by far, I

00:16:36.630 --> 00:16:38.880
think nationwide, the common condition that

00:16:38.880 --> 00:16:40.260
we're talking about is Down's Syndrome.

00:16:41.470 --> 00:16:44.350
I was thinking about how I explained why. I think it's

00:16:44.350 --> 00:16:47.200
a combination of things. Because the condition is genetic, but it's

00:16:47.200 --> 00:16:52.290
not inherited. so, it would randomly appear, and there would be

00:16:52.290 --> 00:16:54.480
no other way to tell about it other than to check

00:16:54.480 --> 00:16:57.840
for it in that pregnancy. And is, there's a known association

00:16:57.840 --> 00:17:00.190
with the age of the mom. As women get older, there's

00:17:00.190 --> 00:17:03.960
a higher chance of Down Syndrome. the insurances actually will cover

00:17:03.960 --> 00:17:08.780
testing for Down Syndrome, so that's kind of a supportive step

00:17:08.780 --> 00:17:12.280
that, that he, aids us in seeing patients.

00:17:12.280 --> 00:17:14.980
it's common, common condition, I think about 1 in

00:17:14.980 --> 00:17:18.980
800, 1000 births for Down syndrome occur. And it

00:17:18.980 --> 00:17:21.460
can be a long-term disability. Children with Down syndrome

00:17:21.460 --> 00:17:24.780
grow up into adults, they have intellectual disability,

00:17:24.780 --> 00:17:27.990
they can have health issues. And so, it seems

00:17:27.990 --> 00:17:29.960
like there's enough interest in that, that we have

00:17:29.960 --> 00:17:34.050
this testing. So for my specialty, it's fairly easy,

00:17:34.050 --> 00:17:36.620
we, we talk primarily about that and some

00:17:36.620 --> 00:17:41.300
related conditions. whereas in other specialties like pediatrics, where

00:17:41.300 --> 00:17:46.030
I use to work it could be a range of things. a variety of things depending on

00:17:46.030 --> 00:17:50.920
what a child comes in to see, for us to see. Whether it's a learning problem, we

00:17:50.920 --> 00:17:52.470
think about, would make us think about certain

00:17:52.470 --> 00:17:55.345
conditions versus if it was a physical birth defect.

00:17:55.345 --> 00:17:55.555
&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.

00:17:55.555 --> 00:17:57.230
&gt;&gt; Like a heart defect or a cleft

00:17:57.230 --> 00:17:59.040
lip that would shift our gear to something else.

00:17:59.040 --> 00:17:59.790
&gt;&gt; If

00:17:59.790 --> 00:18:02.250
you do enough testing for something like Down Syndrome, does

00:18:02.250 --> 00:18:05.690
that mean you're taking a genetic sample from the developing embryo?

00:18:05.690 --> 00:18:10.040
&gt;&gt; So, that is still the goldstar. Yes, the test for down syndrome accurately

00:18:10.040 --> 00:18:11.580
is still an invasive test where you're

00:18:11.580 --> 00:18:15.450
taking tissue indirectly from the baby. So,

00:18:15.450 --> 00:18:19.470
either amniocentesis or chorionic villi sampling, which

00:18:19.470 --> 00:18:21.160
have been, I think available for a

00:18:21.160 --> 00:18:25.090
generation now. So, those are still kind of the gold standard way to test

00:18:25.090 --> 00:18:28.190
for Down syndrome and other chromosome problems, because

00:18:28.190 --> 00:18:31.560
we have tissue from that baby. but more and

00:18:31.560 --> 00:18:33.360
more over the years, we have a lot more

00:18:33.360 --> 00:18:37.780
alternate tests that don't require evasiveness into the pregnancy.

00:18:37.780 --> 00:18:41.480
Primarily blood tests and ultrasounds that can check markers

00:18:41.480 --> 00:18:44.920
for Down syndrome, versus the amnion CVS are looking

00:18:44.920 --> 00:18:47.210
at the chromosomes and looking at the cause of

00:18:47.210 --> 00:18:50.260
Down syndrome. So, so now we have a combination

00:18:50.260 --> 00:18:53.850
of both, and I think especially now, patients are faced

00:18:53.850 --> 00:18:57.080
with so many choices. It really can help them to

00:18:57.080 --> 00:18:59.460
meet with us to sort out all the different options,

00:18:59.460 --> 00:19:04.080
the benefits, the risks, numbers, detection rates, things like that.

00:19:04.080 --> 00:19:07.090
&gt;&gt; What's the most difficult trait you've had to

00:19:07.090 --> 00:19:09.400
counsel? Is it Down syndrome, or is there another

00:19:09.400 --> 00:19:12.440
more difficult situation or trait that you've had to,

00:19:12.440 --> 00:19:14.760
let us say counsel a family on or a couple?

00:19:15.930 --> 00:19:20.190
&gt;&gt; So, Down syndrome is always, it's, it's always a difficult trait. Like, I

00:19:20.190 --> 00:19:21.490
was thinking about this because I have

00:19:21.490 --> 00:19:24.090
experience both in prenatal and in pediatrics.

00:19:26.250 --> 00:19:29.620
I mean one of my most memorable patient cases

00:19:29.620 --> 00:19:31.730
had to, not to do with a Prenatal case,

00:19:31.730 --> 00:19:34.000
but a pediatric case. Where we were seeing a

00:19:34.000 --> 00:19:38.070
child and part of the list of conditions we

00:19:38.070 --> 00:19:41.020
were thinking about was Tay–Sachs disease. So that's one

00:19:41.020 --> 00:19:44.820
is also a known single gene recessive condition that

00:19:44.820 --> 00:19:49.320
is common in people of Jewish background. So when

00:19:49.320 --> 00:19:51.370
we were thinking about that disease, that usually means

00:19:51.370 --> 00:19:54.390
the child is coming in with delays, and maybe normal

00:19:54.390 --> 00:19:58.260
development than loss of delays. so, it's not like it

00:19:58.260 --> 00:20:00.470
was, it's a surprise to the family, we, we would

00:20:00.470 --> 00:20:03.212
talk to them about this is a possibility. We're going to

00:20:03.212 --> 00:20:06.930
be ordering tests for this condition. but it's always hard

00:20:06.930 --> 00:20:09.090
to have to call or contact the family and tell

00:20:09.090 --> 00:20:11.920
them this is, this is a condition. So I think

00:20:11.920 --> 00:20:16.710
any kind of test result that confirms a condition that it

00:20:16.710 --> 00:20:18.990
has high risk for complications or early

00:20:18.990 --> 00:20:24.400
death. that's never easy to, to, to convey.

00:20:24.400 --> 00:20:27.110
&gt;&gt; You do pedigrees, don't you?

00:20:28.730 --> 00:20:31.244
&gt;&gt; Yes, we do, we always do pedigrees.

00:20:31.244 --> 00:20:34.340
it's kind of our shorthand for gathering medical information.

00:20:34.340 --> 00:20:37.360
&gt;&gt; Are you fast? Are you good? How fast can you draw a pedigree?

00:20:37.360 --> 00:20:40.100
&gt;&gt; I'm pretty fast, people, my colleagues would say, I'm

00:20:40.100 --> 00:20:41.990
too fast at a lot of things. So I'm pretty fast

00:20:41.990 --> 00:20:44.990
at drawing a pedigree. We have colleagues that have the template that

00:20:44.990 --> 00:20:49.090
had, they used to have a template that you could trace a pedigree.

00:20:49.090 --> 00:20:49.430
&gt;&gt; Oh, my gosh.

00:20:49.430 --> 00:20:51.510
&gt;&gt; And so I had colleagues who could whip

00:20:51.510 --> 00:20:54.380
out that that template and do the, the rotation of

00:20:54.380 --> 00:20:56.720
things. But most of us can draw free hand pretty

00:20:56.720 --> 00:21:01.140
well. But now, there are programs that also draw pedigrees.

00:21:01.140 --> 00:21:01.240
&gt;&gt; Sure.

00:21:01.240 --> 00:21:04.030
&gt;&gt; because mine are fairly basic, I can

00:21:04.030 --> 00:21:07.620
take maybe three generations of pedigrees. So patients,

00:21:07.620 --> 00:21:11.710
their children, and then their parents. some pedigrees like for cancer, where

00:21:11.710 --> 00:21:13.650
you're really trying to pinpoint all

00:21:13.650 --> 00:21:15.610
the individuals with cancer, those pedigrees could

00:21:15.610 --> 00:21:19.280
get huge. And then, I think the counselors definitely need help with

00:21:19.280 --> 00:21:22.320
a program that can kind of line things up and sort things out.

00:21:22.320 --> 00:21:24.630
&gt;&gt; So do families really have all this information?

00:21:24.630 --> 00:21:26.650
Like are you able to build like these massive

00:21:26.650 --> 00:21:28.590
pedigrees? Or do you end up building these sort

00:21:28.590 --> 00:21:32.680
of, more like, just maybe two or three generation pedigree?

00:21:32.680 --> 00:21:35.910
&gt;&gt; So, families vary in how much information they can

00:21:35.910 --> 00:21:38.730
give us for pedigrees. I see a lot of patients also,

00:21:38.730 --> 00:21:42.090
I should mention that comes from other countries. Especially, specifically

00:21:42.090 --> 00:21:45.760
Asia, where not as, not much is known about family members.

00:21:45.760 --> 00:21:48.570
People don't talk about conditions in the family. So the

00:21:48.570 --> 00:21:51.480
ped, and, and people don't have that many children, so the

00:21:51.480 --> 00:21:55.050
pedigrees can be very sparse. So just like a circle

00:21:55.050 --> 00:21:58.000
and a square, and circle and a square, and that's it.

00:21:58.000 --> 00:22:00.845
And then all the way to families who have their whole

00:22:00.845 --> 00:22:04.370
genealogy trees mapped out with the aid of all these online tools.

00:22:04.370 --> 00:22:04.690
&gt;&gt; Right.

00:22:04.690 --> 00:22:07.080
&gt;&gt; so they come in with their pedigrees already

00:22:07.080 --> 00:22:10.245
drawn. So, it's really a fun part of our

00:22:10.245 --> 00:22:13.480
draw, job, but it's also efficient to draw this

00:22:13.480 --> 00:22:15.460
out instead of trying to describe all these people.

00:22:15.460 --> 00:22:19.050
&gt;&gt; Well, I have a really interesting question to ask for all of our

00:22:19.050 --> 00:22:21.120
students who might be struggling with pedigrees

00:22:21.120 --> 00:22:23.220
out there. How do you as an actual

00:22:23.220 --> 00:22:25.000
genetic counselor, let's say you're studying a trait.

00:22:25.000 --> 00:22:26.730
How do you distinguish when you're looking at

00:22:26.730 --> 00:22:29.800
traits, a recessive or dominant trait and put

00:22:29.800 --> 00:22:32.260
it in context of what you think's going on?

00:22:32.260 --> 00:22:34.720
&gt;&gt; So the, so, trying to figure out a

00:22:34.720 --> 00:22:37.660
trait, whether it's dominant, recessive, or X-linked, those are

00:22:37.660 --> 00:22:40.100
the top three modes of inheritance that we're looking

00:22:40.100 --> 00:22:43.255
at. We actually have a term called pedigree analysis

00:22:43.255 --> 00:22:44.320
[LAUGH].

00:22:44.320 --> 00:22:46.630
and you know, it's, it's a subjective thing, but

00:22:46.630 --> 00:22:49.240
it really is looking at the pedigree. And going

00:22:49.240 --> 00:22:51.580
through kind of all the rules of what dominant

00:22:51.580 --> 00:22:54.420
inheritance looks like, what recessive inheritance looks like. So,

00:22:54.420 --> 00:22:56.930
if you see a trait that happens in a

00:22:56.930 --> 00:23:00.310
grandparent, a parent and a child, then that's much

00:23:00.310 --> 00:23:03.270
more likely to be a dominant trait. If you

00:23:03.270 --> 00:23:06.640
see a condition where multiple brothers and sisters are

00:23:06.640 --> 00:23:08.052
[INAUDIBLE]

00:23:08.052 --> 00:23:12.250
and by chance maybe their parents are related to each other. And no one

00:23:12.250 --> 00:23:13.770
else in the family has the trait,

00:23:13.770 --> 00:23:16.360
then that's more likely or suggestive something

00:23:16.360 --> 00:23:22.045
recessive. And if you see only boys affected through moms, that could be more

00:23:22.045 --> 00:23:24.790
X-linked. So the pedigree really does help

00:23:24.790 --> 00:23:26.800
us try to figure out modes of inheritance.

00:23:26.800 --> 00:23:27.720
&gt;&gt; That's really cool.

00:23:27.720 --> 00:23:27.993
&gt;&gt; Yeah.

00:23:27.993 --> 00:23:30.630
&gt;&gt; what about, I'm super curious, because in, in

00:23:30.630 --> 00:23:33.440
our class, we, we actually learn about sort of the

00:23:33.440 --> 00:23:35.860
possibility of recessive and dominant in, in

00:23:35.860 --> 00:23:38.960
an autosomal context and in excellent context. We

00:23:38.960 --> 00:23:42.630
also briefly go over a maternal inheritance, which

00:23:42.630 --> 00:23:46.890
would be any conditions that affect mitochondria presumably.

00:23:46.890 --> 00:23:47.450
&gt;&gt; Yes, yes.

00:23:47.450 --> 00:23:49.650
&gt;&gt; Are there any conditions or traits that you ever

00:23:49.650 --> 00:23:51.758
have to deal with that fit that model at all?

00:23:51.758 --> 00:23:54.494
&gt;&gt; So, I'm very fortunate that I, I don't interact, or I

00:23:54.494 --> 00:23:55.748
don't have to deal so much

00:23:55.748 --> 00:23:58.769
with maternal inheritance like mitochondrial inheritance,

00:23:58.769 --> 00:24:01.100
because it can be. That's that's still a very

00:24:01.100 --> 00:24:06.050
tricky type of inheritance, up a long with imprinting effects.

00:24:06.050 --> 00:24:06.165
&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.

00:24:06.165 --> 00:24:10.350
&gt;&gt; So there's some complicated modes of inheritance, that, I mean you could

00:24:10.350 --> 00:24:14.090
see in a prenatal pedigree, but would be hard to be born out unless

00:24:14.090 --> 00:24:18.460
someone had a name of a known mitochondrial condition. but my colleagues in

00:24:18.460 --> 00:24:21.530
pediatrics, certainly are looking at children where

00:24:21.530 --> 00:24:24.400
they might be something mitochondrial going on.

00:24:24.400 --> 00:24:26.680
it gives a specific phenotype or picture,

00:24:26.680 --> 00:24:30.020
where children have certain metabolic lab results, they

00:24:30.020 --> 00:24:33.290
have learning delays or physical problems. so often

00:24:33.290 --> 00:24:37.730
times they are telling families, there's a diagnosis

00:24:37.730 --> 00:24:39.860
of something mitochondrial and trying to explain

00:24:39.860 --> 00:24:42.740
inheritance patterns. Which, that is, that is really

00:24:42.740 --> 00:24:45.369
tough, because there's a much higher recurrence risk

00:24:46.990 --> 00:24:48.800
in that then the traditional modes of inheritance.

00:24:48.800 --> 00:24:49.680
&gt;&gt; Have

00:24:49.680 --> 00:24:52.420
you ever had to look at a trait, or

00:24:52.420 --> 00:24:54.260
I don't know, I'm just curious, have you ever looked

00:24:54.260 --> 00:24:56.720
where there, no one knows what the inheritance pattern

00:24:56.720 --> 00:24:58.790
is? Like have you ever discovered a new inheritance pattern?

00:24:58.790 --> 00:24:59.790
&gt;&gt;

00:24:58.790 --> 00:24:59.142
[LAUGH]

00:24:59.142 --> 00:25:00.712
&gt;&gt; Like does that happen as a genetic counselor? Are

00:25:00.712 --> 00:25:03.180
you ever looking at traits that no one's ever described before?

00:25:03.180 --> 00:25:05.410
&gt;&gt; So that's kind of two separate questions.

00:25:05.410 --> 00:25:08.680
So that, looking at a pedigree, sometimes we

00:25:08.680 --> 00:25:11.000
don't know the inheritance. Like it doesn't fit

00:25:11.000 --> 00:25:13.210
a traditional dominant, or it doesn't fit a traditional

00:25:13.210 --> 00:25:15.490
recessive. So that's kind of the fun part

00:25:15.490 --> 00:25:17.530
of our job, where it's a rare occurrence of

00:25:17.530 --> 00:25:20.220
something happening. So it's not, I don't think

00:25:20.220 --> 00:25:24.830
we've discovered a new inheritance, but we've discovered new

00:25:24.830 --> 00:25:28.480
instances of a rare, rare instances of things that

00:25:28.480 --> 00:25:31.610
can happen with traditional inheritance patterns. So that's, that's one

00:25:31.610 --> 00:25:34.460
way. Like something happens on top of something else

00:25:34.460 --> 00:25:37.680
and that's what gives that pattern. and then we can

00:25:37.680 --> 00:25:39.750
also be fooled when people are related to each

00:25:39.750 --> 00:25:43.210
other. because then that throws things, because it could be

00:25:43.210 --> 00:25:45.630
a dominant trait. But if there's relatives that are, are

00:25:45.630 --> 00:25:48.230
related to each other, it could be recessive as well.

00:25:48.230 --> 00:25:48.990
&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.

00:25:48.990 --> 00:25:49.970
&gt;&gt; and

00:25:49.970 --> 00:25:52.020
then your other question just about. I mean, we certainly

00:25:52.020 --> 00:25:56.100
have conditions that nobody's described before. And we see it

00:25:56.100 --> 00:25:58.050
in prenatal, but we see it more in pediatrics, where

00:25:58.050 --> 00:26:01.270
a child comes to us with a unique set of symptoms

00:26:01.270 --> 00:26:04.020
and that's not been described. And so that, that's a

00:26:04.020 --> 00:26:08.810
cool part of a pediatric genetics counselor's or doctor's job

00:26:08.810 --> 00:26:12.600
is they might actually identify a new syndrome. So, I

00:26:12.600 --> 00:26:15.400
haven't personally been part of that, but my colleagues actually have.

00:26:15.400 --> 00:26:18.030
And we know physicians who have discovered new

00:26:18.030 --> 00:26:20.500
conditions and have had them named after them.

00:26:20.500 --> 00:26:21.770
&gt;&gt; Wow.

00:26:21.770 --> 00:26:22.027
&gt;&gt; Yeah.

00:26:22.027 --> 00:26:27.630
&gt;&gt; That's crazy. That's pretty cool. I also wanted to know, I, you know, when

00:26:27.630 --> 00:26:31.250
I learned genetics the first time, and, as you just said a second ago, it,

00:26:31.250 --> 00:26:32.780
it happens. And you have to look

00:26:32.780 --> 00:26:35.110
for it, you're looking for maybe recessive traits,

00:26:35.110 --> 00:26:37.550
and, you see a, unaffected parents and

00:26:37.550 --> 00:26:40.840
affected children, and you're looking for, maybe, close

00:26:40.840 --> 00:26:41.510
relation.

00:26:41.510 --> 00:26:41.950
&gt;&gt; Yeah.

00:26:41.950 --> 00:26:43.600
&gt;&gt; You know, for new beginnings, new, new,

00:26:43.600 --> 00:26:45.477
new students to a class of genetics are like,

00:26:45.477 --> 00:26:48.350
has that really happened. If people find out

00:26:48.350 --> 00:26:51.530
that they actually had children can, can we speak

00:26:51.530 --> 00:26:53.290
to that all. How, how often do you

00:26:53.290 --> 00:26:56.230
people find out either, whether they knew or didn't

00:26:56.230 --> 00:26:58.536
know that they, they you know, didn't have children

00:26:58.536 --> 00:27:00.790
with somebody of a close relation. What's that like?

00:27:00.790 --> 00:27:03.210
&gt;&gt; So, I would say that the, what we

00:27:03.210 --> 00:27:06.890
call consanguinity when people are related to each other.

00:27:06.890 --> 00:27:09.990
Often, in my experience, it's not an unknown thing.

00:27:09.990 --> 00:27:12.130
I mean there a certain cultures in other countries where

00:27:12.130 --> 00:27:15.380
it's actually preferred that people marry within the family.

00:27:17.090 --> 00:27:19.200
and so, it's actually a known thing up front that

00:27:19.200 --> 00:27:21.390
they have to marry within the family to keep

00:27:21.390 --> 00:27:26.030
funding, or money, or status in the family. I have

00:27:26.030 --> 00:27:28.460
had one instance when I was talking to a

00:27:28.460 --> 00:27:31.890
patient on the phone and drawing her pedigree, that she

00:27:31.890 --> 00:27:34.180
did not know she had married either a

00:27:34.180 --> 00:27:36.310
first or se, her, her husband was her first

00:27:36.310 --> 00:27:39.160
or second cousin. And that she found out

00:27:39.160 --> 00:27:41.175
when they were invited to the same family wedding.

00:27:41.175 --> 00:27:42.700
[LAUGH]

00:27:42.700 --> 00:27:47.280
So, I mean, so, I think it doesn't happen in, for, at

00:27:47.280 --> 00:27:49.860
least for me, it hasn't happened that often where people don't know

00:27:49.860 --> 00:27:52.480
they're related to each other. Often times they're coming to us because

00:27:52.480 --> 00:27:55.860
they already know that somehow and they're worried about the risks from that.

00:27:55.860 --> 00:27:59.410
&gt;&gt; Sure. because you hear, we learn about it in textbooks,

00:27:59.410 --> 00:28:02.910
but, I'm like, what, what context does that really happen in?

00:28:02.910 --> 00:28:05.130
&gt;&gt; Or I guess not even relatedness but coming from

00:28:05.130 --> 00:28:08.500
the same community. So, for example, just people of Ashkenazi Jewish

00:28:08.500 --> 00:28:10.540
descents, and I, and I would say hopefully it's

00:28:10.540 --> 00:28:13.360
not disrespectful for anyone from that community. But I

00:28:13.360 --> 00:28:15.210
think there are a lot of communities, whether they're

00:28:15.210 --> 00:28:17.970
religious or cultural that tend to marry from that community.

00:28:17.970 --> 00:28:18.820
&gt;&gt; Sure.

00:28:18.820 --> 00:28:21.660
&gt;&gt; And it's just, I think they call it a Founder Effect. Somebody, an

00:28:21.660 --> 00:28:26.850
ancestor in that, from that gener, culture happened to carry a bad recessive or

00:28:26.850 --> 00:28:30.280
serious recessive gene like Tay-Sachs disease. And he happened to have a lot of

00:28:30.280 --> 00:28:32.160
children and those children happy, happened to

00:28:32.160 --> 00:28:33.680
marry each other. And then that condition

00:28:33.680 --> 00:28:37.920
really increased in incidents. And so that's happened,

00:28:37.920 --> 00:28:40.690
that's been known to happen in certain part pockets.

00:28:40.690 --> 00:28:40.720
&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.

00:28:40.720 --> 00:28:43.660
&gt;&gt; Of population, even if they're not related to each other. If they're a

00:28:43.660 --> 00:28:47.580
close community. So so it's fortunate or

00:28:47.580 --> 00:28:51.130
unfortunate. And, and the Jewish population in general

00:28:51.130 --> 00:28:55.650
I feel like they, they are aware of those increased risks. So many people are

00:28:55.650 --> 00:28:59.190
screened to see if they carry some of these genes, even before they get married.

00:28:59.190 --> 00:29:01.450
&gt;&gt; I see. Well, let's, let's close out here.

00:29:01.450 --> 00:29:04.978
I'm curious, let's maybe think broad aspect again, broad

00:29:04.978 --> 00:29:09.310
perspective. What what do you think other people think

00:29:09.310 --> 00:29:12.010
about genetics and genetic counseling? What do you, what, what

00:29:12.010 --> 00:29:14.050
do you think the general viewpoint is? And, and

00:29:14.050 --> 00:29:17.140
do you think that's good or bad, and should

00:29:17.140 --> 00:29:22.370
we try to change that or influence it in a certain way or is it fine on its own?

00:29:22.370 --> 00:29:24.568
&gt;&gt; So, I, I, I might,

00:29:24.568 --> 00:29:26.970
I'm al, I'm very interested in what, in what

00:29:26.970 --> 00:29:29.330
the public opinion is of genetic counseling. And I

00:29:29.330 --> 00:29:32.020
feel like we here in the Bay Area are

00:29:32.020 --> 00:29:35.060
in a very specific bubble, where we're very fortunate,

00:29:35.060 --> 00:29:38.900
we're in a very liberal area. where genetic testing

00:29:38.900 --> 00:29:43.420
is available, pregnancy termination is available. And so, I

00:29:43.420 --> 00:29:46.560
feel like the, the opinion of genetic counselors here

00:29:46.560 --> 00:29:51.100
in this area is fairly favorable. That people definitely if

00:29:51.100 --> 00:29:53.500
they have met with a genetic counselor, have definitely found it

00:29:53.500 --> 00:29:57.330
helpful and useful. I actually don't think in general nationwide. I still

00:29:57.330 --> 00:30:01.650
think it's a fairly small profession. And my sense is that,

00:30:01.650 --> 00:30:04.370
I mean, we're doing more to promote the profession, but I think

00:30:04.370 --> 00:30:06.320
there's still a lot of people who don't know what genetic

00:30:06.320 --> 00:30:09.370
counselors do and where they fit into things. A lot of patients

00:30:09.370 --> 00:30:12.500
even here, especially if they come from other countries, will hear

00:30:12.500 --> 00:30:16.440
the counseling part of genetic and think that it's a therapy session.

00:30:18.070 --> 00:30:20.560
so there's still a lot of misconceptions about what

00:30:20.560 --> 00:30:24.080
the term means. I don't think it's viewed negatively.

00:30:24.080 --> 00:30:26.060
I think it's just, it's still not very well

00:30:26.060 --> 00:30:30.000
known like other allied health professionals, professions like nurses,

00:30:30.000 --> 00:30:34.190
or social workers, or dentists. So, there's it's encouraging

00:30:34.190 --> 00:30:35.880
that there are more and more of us. And

00:30:35.880 --> 00:30:38.640
with the media being more available on the internet,

00:30:38.640 --> 00:30:43.440
hopefully we'll be promoting our profession better. and just

00:30:43.440 --> 00:30:45.920
spreading the word of the benefits of genetic counseling.

00:30:45.920 --> 00:30:50.620
&gt;&gt; Great. If you, if, if there's somebody watching right now and is really

00:30:50.620 --> 00:30:52.130
interested and wants to learn more about

00:30:52.130 --> 00:30:54.160
being a genetic counselor, what would you,

00:30:54.160 --> 00:30:57.490
do you have any particular good resource you would tell them to go visit?

00:30:57.490 --> 00:31:00.460
Or do you have any special message you would tell them about genetic counseling?

00:31:00.460 --> 00:31:04.130
&gt;&gt; So, yeah. I would, I would highly recommend that their profession if

00:31:04.130 --> 00:31:06.660
anyone's thinking about genetic counseling. it's

00:31:06.660 --> 00:31:10.040
a very good combination of medicine and

00:31:10.040 --> 00:31:12.790
health care, and interacting with patients. So we call

00:31:12.790 --> 00:31:16.270
that a clinical kind of drive, if you like patients.

00:31:16.270 --> 00:31:18.720
And if you like a specific field of genetics, because

00:31:18.720 --> 00:31:20.740
that's pretty much what we're talking about. So if you

00:31:20.740 --> 00:31:23.370
don't like genetics, I wouldn't recommend this profession. But if

00:31:23.370 --> 00:31:26.360
you want to work with people, but still be in tune

00:31:26.360 --> 00:31:30.500
with the science, it's a really good profession. and we

00:31:30.500 --> 00:31:35.310
do have a national society. So there's a website nsgc.org,

00:31:35.310 --> 00:31:37.930
that has all the information about the training programs, the

00:31:37.930 --> 00:31:41.230
background requirements. we've done professional

00:31:41.230 --> 00:31:43.580
status surveys to talk about salary,

00:31:43.580 --> 00:31:48.700
job satisfaction. genetic conselors tend to be more on the side

00:31:48.700 --> 00:31:51.880
of female. I think it's actually up to 95% are female.

00:31:51.880 --> 00:31:52.410
&gt;&gt; Holy cow.

00:31:52.410 --> 00:31:53.410
&gt;&gt;

00:31:52.410 --> 00:31:53.650
[LAUGH].

00:31:53.650 --> 00:31:55.670
So the male genetic counselors are very well known

00:31:55.670 --> 00:31:57.545
in the field because there aren't that many of them

00:31:57.545 --> 00:31:57.970
[LAUGH].

00:31:57.970 --> 00:32:03.040
Especially here in California. so, because of that, there's good

00:32:03.040 --> 00:32:05.450
and bad for that. there are a lot of counselors

00:32:05.450 --> 00:32:08.380
who work part time, and we don't take call like

00:32:08.380 --> 00:32:11.380
physicians or nurses. And so, for those again who want

00:32:11.380 --> 00:32:13.360
to go into medicine but don't want the extra stress

00:32:13.360 --> 00:32:16.580
of those kinds of things, it's a really nice profession.

00:32:16.580 --> 00:32:20.570
a lot of, lots of counselors work part time. again,

00:32:20.570 --> 00:32:23.159
because we're seeing patients and they can be scheduled appointments.

00:32:24.240 --> 00:32:27.860
the salaries I think, especially with our certification and licensure, hopefully

00:32:27.860 --> 00:32:31.875
are starting to increase. And there's certainly a lot of job opportunity.

00:32:31.875 --> 00:32:32.265
&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.

00:32:32.265 --> 00:32:34.850
&gt;&gt; So, I would highly recommend checking out the websites,

00:32:34.850 --> 00:32:38.200
and talking to a genetic counselor if you can. Even shadowing

00:32:38.200 --> 00:32:42.720
a counselor and doing some volunteer work in healthcare. Just to

00:32:42.720 --> 00:32:44.560
make sure that's the area that they like to be in.
