00:00:00.012 --> 00:00:03.280
&gt;&gt; All right Charles, so, so, what do you think the answer is here?

00:00:03.280 --> 00:00:04.470
&gt;&gt; Actually I don't know what you're looking for here.

00:00:04.470 --> 00:00:07.100
&gt;&gt; Oh, okay. Well, so one thing that's true. We

00:00:07.100 --> 00:00:10.120
had to sample the, the variables from A to E.

00:00:10.120 --> 00:00:10.541
&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.

00:00:10.541 --> 00:00:12.620
&gt;&gt; And that's alphabetical order. So do

00:00:12.620 --> 00:00:13.780
you think that's what I was looking for?

00:00:14.800 --> 00:00:19.190
&gt;&gt; Maybe in this case but I would think that that wouldn't be generally true.

00:00:19.190 --> 00:00:21.610
&gt;&gt; True. Right. So, yeah, alphabetical is not what I

00:00:21.610 --> 00:00:25.260
was looking for. So, there's it's a graph theoretic property

00:00:25.260 --> 00:00:27.350
that says we want to basically put the nodes

00:00:27.350 --> 00:00:29.330
in order, so that you always put the things

00:00:29.330 --> 00:00:31.680
that have incoming links that haven't been visited yet

00:00:31.680 --> 00:00:34.610
after the ones where you, they have been visited.

00:00:34.610 --> 00:00:36.270
&gt;&gt; Oh, so it is a lot like alphabetical

00:00:36.270 --> 00:00:38.990
or a lot like lexo-, lexicographic, but it's topological.

00:00:38.990 --> 00:00:42.290
&gt;&gt; There we go. Yeah, that's what I was looking for. So, topological sort.

00:00:42.290 --> 00:00:43.990
&gt;&gt; Which makes perfect sense.

00:00:43.990 --> 00:00:46.590
&gt;&gt; Right, and so this a standard thing that you can do with a graph, and it's

00:00:46.590 --> 00:00:48.340
very quick to, to actually compute one of

00:00:48.340 --> 00:00:51.550
these. It does depend on a particular property, though.

00:00:51.550 --> 00:00:55.010
&gt;&gt; Let's see. Topological only makes sense if you really can

00:00:55.010 --> 00:01:00.120
go from no parents to parents. So, it cannot be cyclical. You

00:01:00.120 --> 00:01:04.319
can't have arrows that take you back. So, E can't be a

00:01:04.319 --> 00:01:07.100
parent of A and also have A be one of its parents.

00:01:07.100 --> 00:01:07.510
&gt;&gt; That's right.

00:01:07.510 --> 00:01:08.570
&gt;&gt; So it must be acyclic.

00:01:08.570 --> 00:01:10.820
&gt;&gt; Must be acyclic, right. And that's going to

00:01:10.820 --> 00:01:12.690
be true in these cases, because we're always going

00:01:12.690 --> 00:01:17.150
to set it up so that in a, in a Bayes net, the variable that we're each

00:01:17.150 --> 00:01:20.440
variable depends on other variables. But they all, it ultimately has to bottom

00:01:20.440 --> 00:01:24.870
out. There can't by cyclic dependencies. So, it is a directed acyclic graph.

00:01:24.870 --> 00:01:27.790
&gt;&gt; So, what would it mean if there were cycles?

00:01:27.790 --> 00:01:29.800
&gt;&gt; I don't know. I don't know what to do with such a graph.

00:01:29.800 --> 00:01:32.370
&gt;&gt; It just doesn't mean anything at all, I guess.

00:01:32.370 --> 00:01:34.910
&gt;&gt; Yeah, I mean, there, there is a family of undirected models.

00:01:34.910 --> 00:01:36.321
&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.

00:01:36.321 --> 00:01:39.365
&gt;&gt; But we're talking only about the directed ones here. So, the directed

00:01:39.365 --> 00:01:42.380
ones yeah, it'd have to be acyclic for the, for the probability distribution

00:01:42.380 --> 00:01:43.100
to be meaningful.

00:01:43.100 --> 00:01:44.065
&gt;&gt; Well, that makes sense.

00:01:44.065 --> 00:01:46.870
&gt;&gt; I'm sure we could make something up, but this is, typically

00:01:46.870 --> 00:01:50.710
this is how it's done. It's, it's, we constrain ourselves to acyclic graphs.

00:01:50.710 --> 00:01:52.350
&gt;&gt; Well, if a Bayesian network is

00:01:52.350 --> 00:01:55.809
supposed to capture conditional independencies, then if you

00:01:55.809 --> 00:01:58.540
add cycles, that's like saying there are none,

00:01:58.540 --> 00:02:01.440
right? I'm not even sure what that means.

00:02:01.440 --> 00:02:03.830
&gt;&gt; I could make it mean something. So here,

00:02:03.830 --> 00:02:07.490
we, we want the probability of A, conditioned on probability

00:02:07.490 --> 00:02:11.230
of A. Well, maybe that's like probability of what, what A was one time step

00:02:11.230 --> 00:02:13.037
ago. Or it could mean that it, you

00:02:13.037 --> 00:02:15.437
know, that, that we've actually putting constraints on

00:02:15.437 --> 00:02:18.040
the joint assignment to all the variables.

00:02:18.040 --> 00:02:21.330
But, yeah, it's not really, it doesn't really,

00:02:21.330 --> 00:02:22.860
it makes things more complicated and that's not

00:02:22.860 --> 00:02:24.740
he model that, that is the typical one

00:02:24.740 --> 00:02:26.110
&gt;&gt; Okay, fair enough.
