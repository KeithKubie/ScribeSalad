00:00:00.004 --> 00:00:04.180
The answer is 8xy+7x squared y.

00:00:04.180 --> 00:00:07.465
Remember that when you don't see
a coefficient, it is implied to be 1.

00:00:08.730 --> 00:00:12.021
So, let's find our like terms.

00:00:12.021 --> 00:00:16.714
8x squared y and
1x squared y are like terms,

00:00:16.714 --> 00:00:20.090
and 7xy and 1xy are like terms.

00:00:21.350 --> 00:00:24.160
Now, we can rearrange this, so
the like terms are next to each other,

00:00:24.160 --> 00:00:28.360
and we'll remember to keep the negative
associated with this term.

00:00:28.360 --> 00:00:31.176
After some rearranging,

00:00:31.176 --> 00:00:37.640
we get 1xy+7xy+8x
squared y-1x squared y.

00:00:37.640 --> 00:00:39.850
We'll combine our like terms.

00:00:39.850 --> 00:00:43.705
So, 1xy+7xy gives 8xy.

00:00:43.705 --> 00:00:50.485
And, 8x squared y-1x squared
y gives 7x squared y.

00:00:50.485 --> 00:00:51.750
And that's our answer.
