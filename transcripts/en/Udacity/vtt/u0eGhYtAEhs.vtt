00:00:00.012 --> 00:00:03.932
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; So let's tie all of this work on factoring back to graphs and solving

00:00:03.932 --> 00:00:08.662
equations. We started off with the equation of a curve, y equals x squared plus

00:00:08.662 --> 00:00:13.160
5x plus 6. And we found that we could factor this, which would give us x plus 3

00:00:13.160 --> 00:00:17.615
times x plus 2. If we wanted to find the x-intercepts of this curve, we just

00:00:17.615 --> 00:00:21.956
need to set y equal to 0. And we know that the two values of x that could

00:00:21.956 --> 00:00:26.646
possibly make this true are if x equals negative 3 or if x equals negative 2. So

00:00:26.646 --> 00:00:31.470
thinking about this, factoring gives us the power not only to find x-intercepts

00:00:31.470 --> 00:00:35.505
but also to solve equations. Let's look into this a little bit more.
