00:00:06.180 --> 00:00:08.320
This is something called
an error-correcting code.

00:00:08.720 --> 00:00:12.220
So if somehow during transmission
some of the 0s get changed to a 1

00:00:12.220 --> 00:00:15.260
or vice-versa, this code
is able to pick up

00:00:15.260 --> 00:00:16.820
that a mistake has been made.

00:00:17.100 --> 00:00:19.840
Now I'm going to need a volunteer
who's going to be a bit of interference

00:00:19.840 --> 00:00:23.200
to scramble my message,
so yeah would you like to come up.

00:00:23.940 --> 00:00:25.140
Okay so you're gonna be
a little bit of noise on the line

00:00:25.140 --> 00:00:27.400
so what's your name?

00:00:27.400 --> 00:00:28.160
– Lauren

00:00:28.160 --> 00:00:30.520
– Lauren, okay Lauren,
what I want you to do

00:00:30.520 --> 00:00:33.032
is you're going to change
one of these numbers over,

00:00:33.040 --> 00:00:36.020
so instead of a 1 it becomes a 0,
so if you look down here Lauren,

00:00:36.360 --> 00:00:38.660
it's on the other side
there's a zero okay, like that.

00:00:38.660 --> 00:00:41.900
So I haven't memorized this
but I'm going to get evil Andy,

00:00:41.900 --> 00:00:46.860
could you blindfold me,
and yeah boo. We want your chocolates.

00:00:47.420 --> 00:00:50.100
Anyway he's gonna blindfold me,
once I'm blindfolded I'll turn my back,

00:00:50.100 --> 00:00:54.180
just change one number over
and hopefully I'll be able to detect

00:00:54.180 --> 00:00:56.000
which number you've changed,
okay.

00:00:56.140 --> 00:00:58.700
So blindfold me up.

00:01:03.100 --> 00:01:04.780
Woarh, gosh,

00:01:05.980 --> 00:01:08.073
that's a bit vicious Andy, gosh.

00:01:08.080 --> 00:01:10.520
Okay so when you're ready
you tell me

00:01:10.520 --> 00:01:12.720
when you've changed
a number over please.

00:01:13.700 --> 00:01:14.860
Just one number.

00:01:16.060 --> 00:01:19.336
Okay, right
I'm going to remove my blindfold

00:01:19.340 --> 00:01:21.660
and hopefully I can spot
which one you've done.

00:01:21.660 --> 00:01:23.820
So as I said I haven't memorised this.

00:01:24.920 --> 00:01:29.120
Okay, let's see, right.

00:01:29.760 --> 00:01:31.780
Beginning to get a feel for it.

00:01:32.220 --> 00:01:36.440
Okay I think that you
changed this number here

00:01:37.240 --> 00:01:40.140
Okay, pretty good.
Was that magic?

00:01:40.140 --> 00:01:41.380
[APPLAUSE]

00:01:41.380 --> 00:01:43.400
Thank you, thank you

00:01:45.140 --> 00:01:46.340
So how did I do that?

00:01:46.340 --> 00:01:49.200
It wasn't magic at all,
it was a bit of mathematics, okay.

00:01:49.200 --> 00:01:51.380
So actually the message
sent by the computer

00:01:51.380 --> 00:01:54.260
isn't the whole thing but just
the top 4 by 4 block.

00:01:54.260 --> 00:01:56.720
So this is actually
the message they want to send,

00:01:56.720 --> 00:01:58.400
so I'm going to separate this off.

00:02:00.760 --> 00:02:05.160
So the message sent by the computer
is actually this top block here

00:02:05.160 --> 00:02:07.320
and the other digits
are used to keep check

00:02:07.320 --> 00:02:09.380
of what's happening
inside the message.

00:02:09.380 --> 00:02:11.840
and actually at the bottom here
if you look at the bottom column

00:02:11.840 --> 00:02:16.600
this number here will be a 1
if there are an odd number of 1s in this column.

00:02:16.600 --> 00:02:19.500
Okay, and if there are
an even number of 1s,

00:02:19.500 --> 00:02:22.140
so in this column,
I put a 0, okay.

00:02:22.140 --> 00:02:25.160
So when you turned
one of the things over,

00:02:25.160 --> 00:02:28.019
it didn't check out, so for example
if I turn that over

00:02:28.020 --> 00:02:30.600
then I've got, well they're meant to be
an even number of 1s there,

00:02:30.600 --> 00:02:32.720
so I know there's a mistake
in that column.

00:02:32.720 --> 00:02:35.260
And the same thing
for the rows over here, okay.

00:02:35.260 --> 00:02:38.640
Why I'm telling this to you because
you're gonna have a go yourself now

00:02:38.640 --> 00:02:40.440
to see if you can
correct a mistake.

00:02:40.740 --> 00:02:42.920
Okay, so you can work out
which column is wrong

00:02:42.920 --> 00:02:44.980
by checking something
wrong down here,

00:02:44.980 --> 00:02:46.500
and which of the rows is wrong.

00:02:46.500 --> 00:02:48.300
OK? Want to take on the challenge?

00:02:48.300 --> 00:02:49.280
–OK 
–All right.

00:02:49.280 --> 00:02:51.900
Okay we're gonna blindfold her,
and you can close your eyes as well 

00:02:51.900 --> 00:02:55.300
if you want to do a challenge.
so let's get you over here, all right.

00:02:55.300 --> 00:02:59.940
I won't be so vicious as Andy,
sort of almost took my head off.

00:03:00.720 --> 00:03:02.800
Okay and we're also not
going to show the viewers at home

00:03:02.800 --> 00:03:04.740
so they can have
a challenge at this as well.

00:03:04.780 --> 00:03:06.140
I'm gonna change
one of the numbers over now

00:03:06.140 --> 00:03:10.340
yeah cover your eyes, and we'll see
whether you can correct the error.

00:03:13.600 --> 00:03:17.960
Okay, I'm done so let's see
whether you can do it.

00:03:19.140 --> 00:03:21.140
[LAUREN TALKS OFF MIC]

00:03:22.060 --> 00:03:24.680
– Zero is even well done,

00:03:25.460 --> 00:03:28.280
something in this column
then is wrong, yeah.

00:03:28.800 --> 00:03:29.960
What about the rows?

00:03:30.840 --> 00:03:35.720
[LAUREN TALKS OFF MIC]

00:03:36.300 --> 00:03:38.580
– That's right, even number of 1s there.

00:03:39.100 --> 00:03:41.100
[LAUREN TALKS OFF MIC]
– And it's odd...

00:03:41.720 --> 00:03:43.040
– So it's first row...

00:03:43.040 --> 00:03:44.620
[LAUREN TALKS OFF MIC]
– Did you change this one?

00:03:44.620 --> 00:03:46.400
– No you had the second column,
that's right that's right,

00:03:46.400 --> 00:03:48.040
so it was this one exactly right,

00:03:48.040 --> 00:03:50.520
so give her a big round of applause
for correcting the error, well done.

00:03:51.140 --> 00:03:54.940
[APPLAUSE]

00:03:55.680 --> 00:03:59.760
Now you might like to have a think about
what happens if one of these numbers

00:03:59.760 --> 00:04:02.560
gets changed on the rows and the columns
which are doing the checking,

00:04:02.560 --> 00:04:04.500
you can even correct those as well.

00:04:04.820 --> 00:04:07.640
Now error correcting codes like this
are used all over the place

00:04:07.640 --> 00:04:11.220
in CDs and satellite communication,
for example when NASA

00:04:11.240 --> 00:04:14.880
sends pictures back from outer space
there's a lot of interference, 

00:04:14.880 --> 00:04:17.320
they use even more
sophisticated mathematics

00:04:17.320 --> 00:04:20.480
this can correct one number,
but they need to correct lots of numbers

00:04:20.480 --> 00:04:22.160
 for example here's a picture
that was sent back

00:04:22.160 --> 00:04:26.420
before it was corrected,
this is Saturn, it's pretty fuzzy,

00:04:26.420 --> 00:04:28.600
but using the mathematics
and error correction,

00:04:28.600 --> 00:04:31.700
they managed to change
it into this – much more crystal clear.
