that's a blunt instrument that it

that's a blunt instrument that it
 

00:19:18.760 --> 00:19:20.850
that's a blunt instrument that it
doesn't drive innovation and very

but all of these challenges are just
 

00:26:17.860 --> 00:26:20.130
but all of these challenges are just
integrational challenges and I think of

what the business structure looked like
so you need technically technical people

00:26:39.690 --> 00:26:39.700
so you need technically technical people
