00:00:00.080 --> 00:00:14.620
On the 16th of August, 1660, an approximately
70 year old William Harrison walked toward

00:00:14.620 --> 00:00:19.160
the village of Charingworth, about two miles
from Chipping Campden, with the intention

00:00:19.160 --> 00:00:23.119
of collecting rent for his employer, the Lady
Viscountess Campden.

00:00:23.119 --> 00:00:27.039
When he failed to return home, Harrison’s
wife sent out their servant, John Perry, to

00:00:27.039 --> 00:00:29.400
find him, but neither man returned that evening.

00:00:29.400 --> 00:00:33.610
Becoming more alarmed, Harrison’s son, Edward,
went looking for his father and Perry the

00:00:33.610 --> 00:00:38.040
next morning, and finally found John Perry
on the road to Charingworth, but the latter

00:00:38.040 --> 00:00:40.770
explained that he had not found the elder
Harrison.

00:00:40.770 --> 00:00:44.940
The two then set out to Ebrington where they
found tenants Harrison was to have visited

00:00:44.940 --> 00:00:49.480
and learned that Harrison had, in fact, made
contact with them, but no sign of him was

00:00:49.480 --> 00:00:50.610
otherwise found.

00:00:50.610 --> 00:00:56.320
That is, until William Harrison’s blood-stained
collar, hat and comb were found along the

00:00:56.320 --> 00:00:57.320
road.

00:00:57.320 --> 00:01:00.820
Seemingly at least partially owing to John
Perry inexplicably not returning the night

00:01:00.820 --> 00:01:06.290
he went out searching for Harrison, suspicion
soon fell on him and rumors started that he

00:01:06.290 --> 00:01:08.040
had murdered his master.

00:01:08.040 --> 00:01:12.070
When first interrogated, Perry explained the
reason he had not returned that night was

00:01:12.070 --> 00:01:13.400
because he got lost.

00:01:13.400 --> 00:01:17.960
You see, when first ordered to go out into
the night to search for Harrison, Perry claimed

00:01:17.960 --> 00:01:21.550
he was too scared to do it owing to it being
completely dark.

00:01:21.550 --> 00:01:25.700
Thus, after a brief walk about, he instead
went and hid in his master’s hen house.

00:01:25.700 --> 00:01:29.190
Around midnight, however, the moon came out
providing enough light to search by.

00:01:29.190 --> 00:01:33.490
But in the process of searching, a mist descended
causing him to get lost.

00:01:33.490 --> 00:01:37.240
He then went to sleep under a bush for the
night and resumed his search the next day,

00:01:37.240 --> 00:01:39.360
at which point Edward Harrison found him.

00:01:39.360 --> 00:01:43.890
He otherwise claimed he had no knowledge of
what had happened to the elder Harrison.

00:01:43.890 --> 00:01:48.490
The magistrate being unsatisfied with this
story, Perry was detained while further investigation

00:01:48.490 --> 00:01:50.420
could take place.

00:01:50.420 --> 00:01:55.930
Approximately a week later, with little progress
in the case, Perry was subjected to additional

00:01:55.930 --> 00:01:56.930
interrogation.

00:01:56.930 --> 00:01:59.920
Initially, he stuck to his story, but later
changed his tune.

00:01:59.920 --> 00:02:04.420
It’s important to note here that it may
be that subsequent interrogations were of

00:02:04.420 --> 00:02:08.410
the strong-armed variety (as was very common
at the time), or he might have simply been

00:02:08.410 --> 00:02:13.140
scared he’d be tried for murder so wanted
to shift the blame to anyone else.

00:02:13.140 --> 00:02:17.690
Whatever the case, during the subsequent interrogation,
Perry supposedly intimated that a Tinker had

00:02:17.690 --> 00:02:23.500
killed Harrison and later that he knew a servant
of an unnamed Gentleman had robbed and murdered

00:02:23.500 --> 00:02:24.500
Harrison.

00:02:24.500 --> 00:02:27.959
In yet another interrogation after this, Perry
finally cracked, claiming that his mother,

00:02:27.959 --> 00:02:32.610
Joan, and brother, Richard, had waited until
Harrison had finished collecting rents and

00:02:32.610 --> 00:02:35.260
then robbed and killed him, dumping his body
in a pond.

00:02:35.260 --> 00:02:39.930
He even gave a detailed account of the event,
including his own involvement in it, telling

00:02:39.930 --> 00:02:42.910
his brother when to expect Harrison and where.

00:02:42.910 --> 00:02:46.910
He also stated after Harrison had been attacked,
he encountered his mother, brother, and the

00:02:46.910 --> 00:02:48.340
unconscious Harrison.

00:02:48.340 --> 00:02:54.030
To quote the confession as recounted by magistrate
Sir Thomas Overbury in his 1676 account of

00:02:54.030 --> 00:02:55.030
the event,

00:02:55.030 --> 00:02:59.170
At which he told his Brother, he hoped he
would not kill his Master; who replied, Peasce,

00:02:59.170 --> 00:03:03.220
Peace, you’re a Fool, and so strangled him;
which having done, he took a Bag of Money

00:03:03.220 --> 00:03:08.380
out of his Pocket, and threw it into his Mother’s
Lap, and then he and his Brother carried his

00:03:08.380 --> 00:03:13.280
Master’s dead Body into the Garden, adjoining
to the Conygree, where they consulted what

00:03:13.280 --> 00:03:18.000
to do with it; and, at length, agreed to throw
it into the great Sink, by Wallington’s

00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:19.000
Mill…

00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:23.060
He then stated his mother told him to return
to his master’s house to see if anyone had

00:03:23.060 --> 00:03:25.250
grown suspicious of Harrison’s absence.

00:03:25.250 --> 00:03:28.640
He later claimed to have taken the bloodied
hat, collar, and comb, slashed them with a

00:03:28.640 --> 00:03:33.780
knife and then placed them along the road
so it would be assumed Harrison had been robbed

00:03:33.780 --> 00:03:35.450
and murdered there.

00:03:35.450 --> 00:03:39.480
When brought in for questioning, Joan and
Richard Perry denied the entire story, and

00:03:39.480 --> 00:03:42.760
although the pond was dredged, no body was
found.

00:03:42.760 --> 00:03:46.780
As Joan and Richard did not have an alibi
during the night in question and John Perry

00:03:46.780 --> 00:03:51.360
seemingly would have no reason to implicate
himself in murdering a man, all three Perry’s

00:03:51.360 --> 00:03:53.720
were arrested for the murder of William Harrison.

00:03:53.720 --> 00:03:57.810
However, owing to the lack of a body or clear
evidence that a murder had taken place at

00:03:57.810 --> 00:04:02.370
all, the presiding judge in the case, Sir
Christopher Turner, ultimately refused to

00:04:02.370 --> 00:04:04.130
prosecute the three for murder.

00:04:04.130 --> 00:04:10.550
That said, about a year previous, the Harrison
household had been robbed of £140.

00:04:10.550 --> 00:04:14.620
Given John Perry’s assertion that his family
had been continually pressuring him to rob

00:04:14.620 --> 00:04:19.959
the Harrisons and that they themselves supposedly
had intent to do so, John Perry was questioned

00:04:19.959 --> 00:04:21.449
about the former robbery.

00:04:21.449 --> 00:04:25.749
He then affirmed that his brother had committed
the robbery and, while John himself wasn’t

00:04:25.749 --> 00:04:30.490
directly involved in the act, he had told
his brother where the money was kept.

00:04:30.490 --> 00:04:34.159
After stealing the money, it was supposedly
buried in Perry’s garden with the intent

00:04:34.159 --> 00:04:38.790
of digging it up during the next Feast of
Archangels, long after most would have forgotten

00:04:38.790 --> 00:04:39.830
about the robbery.

00:04:39.830 --> 00:04:44.069
The timing of this meant that the money should
still have been buried in the garden when

00:04:44.069 --> 00:04:49.360
John Perry was confessing this, but when the
garden was searched, no money was found.

00:04:49.360 --> 00:04:53.090
Interestingly, despite no evidence whatsoever
that the Perrys had robbed the Harrisons the

00:04:53.090 --> 00:04:57.819
year previous other than John Perry’s assertion,
and despite that Perry’s mother and brother

00:04:57.819 --> 00:05:02.889
denied that they had done this, all three
pled guilty on the robbery charge.

00:05:02.889 --> 00:05:03.889
Why?

00:05:03.889 --> 00:05:11.039
Well, as for John, he’d already implicated
himself as an accomplice, so it was natural

00:05:11.039 --> 00:05:13.289
enough that he would then plead guilty.

00:05:13.289 --> 00:05:16.070
His mother and brother were a different matter.

00:05:16.070 --> 00:05:21.740
They initially pled not guilty, but within
minutes of this changed their plea to guilty.

00:05:21.740 --> 00:05:27.199
It appears they were advised to do this and
to ask for a pardon under the Indemnity and

00:05:27.199 --> 00:05:31.400
Oblivion Act of 1660 as a time saving measure
for the court.

00:05:31.400 --> 00:05:35.339
In a nutshell, this Act was a general pardon
for anyone who had committed a crime during

00:05:35.339 --> 00:05:40.690
the Civil War and Interregnum so long as said
crime wasn’t unlicensed murder, rape, piracy,

00:05:40.690 --> 00:05:42.849
witchcraft, sodomy, or bestiality.

00:05:42.849 --> 00:05:47.199
Thanks to this, if the three pled guilty and
asked for a pardon, they would not receive

00:05:47.199 --> 00:05:52.080
any punishment whatsoever and the court wouldn’t
have to waste time in attempting to prosecute

00:05:52.080 --> 00:05:53.080
the case.

00:05:53.080 --> 00:05:58.310
Thus, they pled guilty and were immediately
let go.

00:05:58.310 --> 00:06:01.599
This act likely cost the three their lives.

00:06:01.599 --> 00:06:07.529
You see, when Harrison still hadn’t turned
up by the spring of 1661, it was decided that

00:06:07.529 --> 00:06:08.819
he must have been murdered.

00:06:08.819 --> 00:06:13.219
Because the three had pled guilty to robbing
Harrison previously; Harrison had been known

00:06:13.219 --> 00:06:17.550
to have been carrying significant rent money
on the night in question; at least John Perry

00:06:17.550 --> 00:06:21.629
had known this fact and the route Harrison
would be taking; and Harrison’s bloodied

00:06:21.629 --> 00:06:27.069
items had been found, it was decided there
was sufficient evidence to try the three for

00:06:27.069 --> 00:06:28.569
Harrison’s murder.

00:06:28.569 --> 00:06:33.520
Despite proclaiming their innocence, the judge,
Sir Robert Hyde, and jury didn’t buy it.

00:06:33.520 --> 00:06:39.360
The three were convicted of murder and hanged
together in Gloucestershire on Broadway Hill.

00:06:39.360 --> 00:06:43.520
Since Joan had also been suspected of being
a witch, she was, naturally, hanged first

00:06:43.520 --> 00:06:48.129
in the hopes that any spell on her sons would
be lifted by her death, allowing them to confess

00:06:48.129 --> 00:06:49.180
to the murder.

00:06:49.180 --> 00:06:53.779
But in all three cases, the trio, including
John, professed their innocence right up to

00:06:53.779 --> 00:06:56.279
their short drop and sudden stop.

00:06:56.279 --> 00:07:01.219
John even recanted his former story, saying
he made it up and actually knew nothing of

00:07:01.219 --> 00:07:02.839
what happened to Harrison.

00:07:02.839 --> 00:07:06.159
And, it turns out, they were telling the truth.

00:07:06.159 --> 00:07:10.319
Approximately one year after they were hanged,
William Harrison returned to Chipping Campden

00:07:10.319 --> 00:07:11.849
alive and well.

00:07:11.849 --> 00:07:15.199
So where had he been all that time?

00:07:15.199 --> 00:07:18.919
He claimed that he had been robbed and kidnapped
by two men on horseback.

00:07:18.919 --> 00:07:23.719
During the ensuing melee, the elderly man
also claims to have been stabbed in the thigh

00:07:23.719 --> 00:07:24.719
and side.

00:07:24.719 --> 00:07:29.490
After this, he states he was sold for seven
pounds to a group who dealt in human trafficking.

00:07:29.490 --> 00:07:33.360
He was then placed aboard a ship to presumably
be sold into slavery.

00:07:33.360 --> 00:07:39.469
It was while aboard the ship for an inexplicably
long six weeks that he was nursed back to

00:07:39.469 --> 00:07:40.469
health.

00:07:40.469 --> 00:07:44.949
However, in route to whatever destination,
the slave ship was attacked around North Africa

00:07:44.949 --> 00:07:50.529
by Turkish pirates, who then took Harrison
and the rest aboard and sold them into slavery.

00:07:50.529 --> 00:07:54.800
As for Harrison, he claims to have been sold
to an elderly doctor in Smyrna (modern day

00:07:54.800 --> 00:07:55.800
Izmir, Turkey).

00:07:55.800 --> 00:08:00.099
His time as an assistant to the doctor was
cut short, however, after only about a year

00:08:00.099 --> 00:08:01.740
when his new master died.

00:08:01.740 --> 00:08:05.860
After this, he claimed that he used a silver
bowl his master had given him to gain passage

00:08:05.860 --> 00:08:08.059
on a Portuguese ship returning home.

00:08:08.059 --> 00:08:12.259
In Portugal, he encountered a fellow Englishman
who took pity on him, providing him money

00:08:12.259 --> 00:08:14.129
for food and passage back to England.

00:08:14.129 --> 00:08:17.639
As you might expect, while this sort of kidnapping
wasn’t totally unheard of, the idea of someone

00:08:17.639 --> 00:08:20.939
choosing to kidnap a man about 70 years old
at the time of his abduction (so little value

00:08:20.939 --> 00:08:22.479
on the slave market, even if not near death
from being stabbed) is generally considered

00:08:22.479 --> 00:08:23.479
a bit suspect.

00:08:23.479 --> 00:08:26.340
Certainly the rent money he was carrying would
have been worth the robbery part, but the

00:08:26.340 --> 00:08:30.349
trouble and additional risk in transporting
and selling him to the slaver group wouldn’t

00:08:30.349 --> 00:08:33.849
have been worth the seven pounds they supposedly
got for him.

00:08:33.849 --> 00:08:37.202
Because of this, it’s speculated that perhaps
he simply skipped town with the money he’d

00:08:37.202 --> 00:08:41.200
been collecting for his master and left his
bloodied items behind to make people think

00:08:41.200 --> 00:08:42.200
he’d been killed.

00:08:42.200 --> 00:08:46.850
However, the aforementioned Sir Thomas Overbury
notes that this seems unlikely given the elderly

00:08:46.850 --> 00:08:50.160
Harrison was reasonably well off in his current
profession already.

00:08:50.160 --> 00:08:55.090
He also hadn’t taken any of the considerable
sum of money he’d himself accumulated over

00:08:55.090 --> 00:08:56.090
his lifetime.

00:08:56.090 --> 00:09:00.550
On top of this, he was well respected and
had a good reputation around town, including

00:09:00.550 --> 00:09:04.570
having always seemed happy with his station,
even up to his disappearance.

00:09:04.570 --> 00:09:09.910
Sir Thomas does speculate that perhaps someone
hired the supposed kidnappers to attack Harrison

00:09:09.910 --> 00:09:13.970
and get him out of the way, explaining why
such might bother to kidnap such an elderly

00:09:13.970 --> 00:09:15.630
individual in the first place.

00:09:15.630 --> 00:09:19.960
Sir Thomas thought the prime suspect in that
scenario would perhaps be Harrison’s son,

00:09:19.960 --> 00:09:24.410
hoping to get Harrison’s job, though even
this is a bit of a stretch given the known

00:09:24.410 --> 00:09:25.670
facts of the case.

00:09:25.670 --> 00:09:30.080
Curiously, a couple weeks before Harrison’s
disappearance, there is record of John Perry

00:09:30.080 --> 00:09:35.030
reporting being attacked along the road by
two men wielding swords, though he ultimately

00:09:35.030 --> 00:09:36.340
managed to escape.

00:09:36.340 --> 00:09:39.770
During his later interrogation for murder,
however, he changed his story and said he’d

00:09:39.770 --> 00:09:44.330
made the whole thing up with a mind to use
the story to remove suspicion from himself

00:09:44.330 --> 00:09:48.110
and his family when they later would rob and
murder Harrison.

00:09:48.110 --> 00:09:52.280
Whatever really happened, despite magistrate
Sir Thomas Overbury noting that at least some

00:09:52.280 --> 00:09:56.820
at the time thought Harrison’s story farfetched,
there doesn’t seem to be any record of anyone

00:09:56.820 --> 00:10:01.970
interrogating him further about it and he
was also given his old job back and resumed

00:10:01.970 --> 00:10:03.020
his duties.

00:10:03.020 --> 00:10:06.020
As you might imagine, the fact that the justice
system had executed a trio of people for the

00:10:06.020 --> 00:10:10.320
murder of William Harrison when he hadn’t
been murdered resulted in a bit of a public

00:10:10.320 --> 00:10:11.320
outcry.

00:10:11.320 --> 00:10:15.150
It’s often stated that, as a result of this
injustice, the English courts instituted a

00:10:15.150 --> 00:10:20.850
new criminal rule “No body, no murder”-
a law that supposedly stayed in place for

00:10:20.850 --> 00:10:26.020
some three centuries after, being rescinded
during the 20th century.

00:10:26.020 --> 00:10:30.661
However, we could find no such record of any
such specific “no body, no murder” law

00:10:30.661 --> 00:10:35.110
being instituted and there are certainly plenty
of cases of people being convicted of murder

00:10:35.110 --> 00:10:38.740
in England in the interim when no body was
found.

00:10:38.740 --> 00:10:43.190
Any such law would also have created a huge
loophole to relatively easily get away with

00:10:43.190 --> 00:10:47.280
murder- you’d just needed to be really good
at hiding the remains, which wouldn’t have

00:10:47.280 --> 00:10:48.280
been difficult.

00:10:48.280 --> 00:10:51.750
For example, for a time things like medical
schools and the like would not only pay you

00:10:51.750 --> 00:10:56.490
for said body with no questions asked, but
generally keep quiet about everything and

00:10:56.490 --> 00:10:59.400
dispose of the body themselves in a way that
the remains wouldn’t be identifiable.

00:10:59.400 --> 00:11:03.310
(This is actually the impetus for the infamous
Burke and Hare murders that occurred in Scotland

00:11:03.310 --> 00:11:05.000
during the 19th century.)

00:11:05.000 --> 00:11:09.023
That said, corpus deliciti did exist which
is a similar concept to this “no body, no

00:11:09.023 --> 00:11:13.740
murder” idea, but in this case a physical
body is not actually required.

00:11:13.740 --> 00:11:18.600
You just need sufficient evidence that a murder
occurred, which may include an actual body,

00:11:18.600 --> 00:11:21.150
but could also simply be testimonial evidence.

00:11:21.150 --> 00:11:26.250
Essentially, you just needed a body of evidence
to show a murder had taken place, rather than

00:11:26.250 --> 00:11:30.780
an actual physical body being required, which
is perhaps where the aforementioned apparent

00:11:30.780 --> 00:12:02.270
“no body, no murder” misconception comes
from.
