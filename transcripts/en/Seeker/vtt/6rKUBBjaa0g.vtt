00:00:00.089 --> 00:00:03.889
The heart of a baboon, the eye of a newt,
and the skin of a pig, is not just a recipe

00:00:03.889 --> 00:00:05.470
for witchcraft anymore.

00:00:05.470 --> 00:00:11.050
Some might be part of the future of organ
transplantation.

00:00:11.050 --> 00:00:15.610
Hey everyone welcome to DNews, I'm Trace.

00:00:15.610 --> 00:00:20.250
For more than two years, a baboon at a research
institute in Maryland survived with the heart

00:00:20.250 --> 00:00:21.600
of a pig in its abdomen!

00:00:21.600 --> 00:00:22.600
Two.

00:00:22.600 --> 00:00:23.600
YEARS.

00:00:23.600 --> 00:00:27.430
The previous record for implanting an organ
from another species was about 500 days, but

00:00:27.430 --> 00:00:31.500
this heart made it to 945 days!

00:00:31.500 --> 00:00:34.230
Cross-species transplantation is called xenotransplantation.

00:00:34.230 --> 00:00:38.309
It might seem like a Frankensteinian fiction,
but it's been done.

00:00:38.309 --> 00:00:42.430
A baboon heart was transplanted into a newborn
baby with a heart problem (she lived almost

00:00:42.430 --> 00:00:46.809
three weeks), burn patients sometimes accept
skin grafts from pigs, and Parkinson's patients

00:00:46.809 --> 00:00:49.520
have received neurons from our p-p-p-porky
pals as well.

00:00:49.520 --> 00:00:55.030
It would seem we have an unending supply of
organs from animals grown for food, but cross-species

00:00:55.030 --> 00:01:00.550
transplants -- though hypothesized for centuries,
are JUST becoming a reality… if scientists

00:01:00.550 --> 00:01:02.050
can get it to work properly…

00:01:02.050 --> 00:01:04.489
Firstly, we needed to pick a species.

00:01:04.489 --> 00:01:08.580
The natural inclination may be to use genetically
related primates, like chimpanzees!

00:01:08.580 --> 00:01:11.279
But, chimps are endangered…

00:01:11.279 --> 00:01:14.470
Baboons on the other hand, are genetically
similar to chimps and humans, and are relatively

00:01:14.470 --> 00:01:15.470
plentiful!

00:01:15.470 --> 00:01:16.979
But, they're terrible transplant donors!

00:01:16.979 --> 00:01:20.380
Their organs are too small and matching our
blood types is incredibly rare.

00:01:20.380 --> 00:01:24.890
In fact, throughout history doctors have been
pretty slapdash at picking animals, trying

00:01:24.890 --> 00:01:28.770
sheep, rabbits, dogs, cats, rats, chickens…
even pigeons!!

00:01:28.770 --> 00:01:31.939
It turns out pigs might be one of the best.

00:01:31.939 --> 00:01:36.109
Despite having little genetic commonality,
pigs bodies and organs are almost identical

00:01:36.109 --> 00:01:38.409
in form and function to a human’s!

00:01:38.409 --> 00:01:41.689
The heart, specifically, is roughly the same
size and shape.

00:01:41.689 --> 00:01:44.869
Because of this, we already use pig valves
in some heart repair!

00:01:44.869 --> 00:01:49.060
Additionally, pigs are plentiful, and society
has no real qualms about killing them -- even

00:01:49.060 --> 00:01:50.359
if some people do.

00:01:50.359 --> 00:01:52.829
Okay, so we've got our pig, now what?

00:01:52.829 --> 00:01:56.529
Well, any time a foreign object enters your
body, your immune system mounts a defense

00:01:56.529 --> 00:02:01.249
to wipe out the intruder If someone just jams
a new heart in you, your body will assume

00:02:01.249 --> 00:02:06.059
that it is a giant virus or some other invader
and begin attacking it with a fervor.

00:02:06.059 --> 00:02:10.659
There are two ways to stop this, one: immunosuppressant
drugs -- literally shut down the immune system;

00:02:10.659 --> 00:02:11.850
obviously not ideal…

00:02:11.850 --> 00:02:15.870
OR you can trick the immune system into thinking
the new organ was part of the body the whole

00:02:15.870 --> 00:02:16.870
time.

00:02:16.870 --> 00:02:21.000
Simply put, most tissues have proteins on
their surface called Human Leukocyte Antigens.

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:24.719
They're like license plates, telling your
immune system which tissues are local.

00:02:24.719 --> 00:02:29.340
If researchers can take the plates off the
new organ (or match them) the immune system

00:02:29.340 --> 00:02:30.790
will leave it be.

00:02:30.790 --> 00:02:35.400
In this case, doctors implanted the pig heart
into the baboon's abdomen and used drugs to

00:02:35.400 --> 00:02:37.239
suppressed the immune system.

00:02:37.239 --> 00:02:38.530
But, there's another concern!

00:02:38.530 --> 00:02:44.810
Pigs, unlike humans, have ANOTHER antigen
called galactose oligosaccharide -- or just

00:02:44.810 --> 00:02:45.810
Gal.

00:02:45.810 --> 00:02:50.280
In the 90s, researchers realized because humans
don't make Gal our immune systems goes crazy

00:02:50.280 --> 00:02:51.299
when it sees it.

00:02:51.299 --> 00:02:55.260
It's like seeing a license plate from Nazi
Germany in Cleveland.

00:02:55.260 --> 00:02:58.739
The organ can be rejected in MINUTES.

00:02:58.739 --> 00:03:02.900
In 2007, cloning technology finally resulted
in a gal knockout pig!

00:03:02.900 --> 00:03:06.650
Basically, a pig without the gene to make
the gal antigen.

00:03:06.650 --> 00:03:12.140
This pig heart, was one of those genetically
modified gal knockouts.

00:03:12.140 --> 00:03:13.650
No antigen backlash!

00:03:13.650 --> 00:03:15.640
945 days of hearty fun!

00:03:15.640 --> 00:03:19.629
It might have gone longer, but the heart began
to degrade as the immunosuppressants were

00:03:19.629 --> 00:03:20.629
relieved.

00:03:20.629 --> 00:03:24.409
This is a really exciting test, because if
the pig heart can survive and pump blood in

00:03:24.409 --> 00:03:30.639
a close human relative even for a short time;
it might open the doors for pig parts to become

00:03:30.639 --> 00:03:33.959
'bridge organs' for those waiting for a human
ones.

00:03:33.959 --> 00:03:37.230
22 patients die everyday waiting for donor
organs!

00:03:37.230 --> 00:03:40.770
Broadening the field of potential donors could
save thousands of people.

00:03:40.770 --> 00:03:45.069
Obviously, the ability to keep the body from
rejecting any foreign organ is amazing…

00:03:45.069 --> 00:03:48.950
But to use one from another species is just
insanely medievally cool.

00:03:48.950 --> 00:03:52.500
Plenty more research still needs to be done,
but still, can you imagine walking around

00:03:52.500 --> 00:03:53.500
with a pig heart?!

00:03:53.500 --> 00:03:54.500
Wow.

00:03:54.500 --> 00:03:55.500
I wonder if I'd become more delicious.

00:03:55.500 --> 00:03:56.500
MMMMmmm.

00:03:56.500 --> 00:03:58.639
Look if you're into weird transplants, then
you should definitely check out Julian's video

00:03:58.639 --> 00:04:01.889
about how doctors are transplanting penises.

00:04:01.889 --> 00:04:05.590
Julian totally went there.

00:04:05.590 --> 00:04:18.239
OR, if you want to know more about how we
swap out antigen license plates to help organs

00:04:18.239 --> 00:04:30.750
work in new people,: Amy's got that for you,
right here.

00:04:30.750 --> 00:04:33.350
Let's say you needed an organ… would you
take a pig heart?

00:04:33.350 --> 00:04:34.480
Do you have qualms?

00:04:34.480 --> 00:04:36.990
Tell me about it.
