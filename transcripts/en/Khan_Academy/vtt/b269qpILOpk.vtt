00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.360
Let's say I've got
some subspace, v,

00:00:03.360 --> 00:00:04.590
that's a plane in R3.

00:00:04.590 --> 00:00:08.050
So let me see if I can draw
it respectably well.

00:00:08.050 --> 00:00:11.130
Let me draw some plane in R3.

00:00:11.130 --> 00:00:14.950
Maybe it looks something
like that.

00:00:14.950 --> 00:00:17.256
That is my subspace.

00:00:17.256 --> 00:00:18.340
I think that's good enough.

00:00:18.340 --> 00:00:20.580
Let me see if I can draw it a
little bit better than that.

00:00:20.580 --> 00:00:21.710
There you go.

00:00:21.710 --> 00:00:24.240
So that is my plane in R3.

00:00:24.240 --> 00:00:26.280
This is v.

00:00:26.280 --> 00:00:27.530
This is a subspace.

00:00:30.230 --> 00:00:33.550
And let's say that I have
some other vector, x,

00:00:33.550 --> 00:00:34.845
any vector in R3.

00:00:34.845 --> 00:00:37.970
So my vector x looks
like this.

00:00:37.970 --> 00:00:40.570
That is my vector x.

00:00:40.570 --> 00:00:43.430
Now what I want to show you
in this video is that the

00:00:43.430 --> 00:00:46.770
projection of x onto our
subspace-- and let's say that

00:00:46.770 --> 00:00:49.050
this is our 0 vector
right there.

00:00:49.050 --> 00:00:51.880
I want to show you that the
projection of x onto our

00:00:51.880 --> 00:00:57.240
subspace is the closest vector
in our subspace to x.

00:00:57.240 --> 00:00:59.840
So let me draw that out,
and maybe it'll make

00:00:59.840 --> 00:01:00.790
a little more sense.

00:01:00.790 --> 00:01:03.150
So the projection of x on to
the subspace will look

00:01:03.150 --> 00:01:04.610
something like this.

00:01:04.610 --> 00:01:07.220
It will look something
like that.

00:01:07.220 --> 00:01:10.320
That right there, that green
vector right there, is the

00:01:10.320 --> 00:01:17.010
projection of the vector
x onto our subspace v.

00:01:17.010 --> 00:01:18.200
That's our vector x.

00:01:18.200 --> 00:01:23.600
Now, let's take some arbitrary
other vector in our subspace.

00:01:23.600 --> 00:01:26.800
Let's just take this one.

00:01:26.800 --> 00:01:28.690
This is just some
other arbitrary

00:01:28.690 --> 00:01:30.390
vector in our subspace.

00:01:30.390 --> 00:01:32.250
Let me draw a little
bit differently.

00:01:32.250 --> 00:01:35.280
We draw it like that.

00:01:35.280 --> 00:01:38.120
Let's call that vector v.

00:01:38.120 --> 00:01:40.400
That's clearly another vector
on our subspace.

00:01:40.400 --> 00:01:41.970
It lies on that plane.

00:01:41.970 --> 00:01:48.490
What I want to show you is that
the distance from x to

00:01:48.490 --> 00:01:51.875
our projection of x on to v is
shorter than the distance from

00:01:51.875 --> 00:01:54.270
x to any other vector.

00:01:54.270 --> 00:01:56.290
From the distance from x
to any other vector.

00:01:56.290 --> 00:01:58.480
And obviously, the way I've
drawn it, it looks pretty

00:01:58.480 --> 00:02:00.810
clear that this line is shorter
than that line.

00:02:00.810 --> 00:02:03.430
But that was just a particular
choice that I picked.

00:02:03.430 --> 00:02:04.830
Let's prove it that's general.

00:02:04.830 --> 00:02:08.139
So what I want to prove is that
the distance between x

00:02:08.139 --> 00:02:11.560
and its projection onto the
subspace-- and the way we can

00:02:11.560 --> 00:02:15.750
get that is essentially just
take the length of the vector

00:02:15.750 --> 00:02:23.920
of x minus the projection
of x onto my subspace.

00:02:23.920 --> 00:02:28.220
This length right here is this
length right here, is this

00:02:28.220 --> 00:02:31.260
length right here.

00:02:31.260 --> 00:02:37.180
So x minus the projection of x
onto v, that's going to be

00:02:37.180 --> 00:02:39.690
this vector right there.

00:02:39.690 --> 00:02:41.460
Let me do that in a
different color.

00:02:41.460 --> 00:02:44.230
Don't want to reuse
colors too often.

00:02:44.230 --> 00:02:46.430
That's going to be that
vector right there.

00:02:46.430 --> 00:02:50.200
We could call that vector a.

00:02:50.200 --> 00:02:53.190
It's clearly in the orthogonal
complement of v, because it's

00:02:53.190 --> 00:02:54.150
orthogonal to this guy.

00:02:54.150 --> 00:02:56.433
And that's the definition of a
projection, actually, so this

00:02:56.433 --> 00:02:59.760
is equal to a.

00:02:59.760 --> 00:03:04.020
My claim, what I want to show
you, is that this distance a

00:03:04.020 --> 00:03:13.610
is shorter than any distance
here, is less than or equal to

00:03:13.610 --> 00:03:17.800
the distance between x and
v, where v is any member.

00:03:17.800 --> 00:03:19.270
So that's this distance,
right here.

00:03:19.270 --> 00:03:22.960
This vector right here, that
distance right-- let me draw

00:03:22.960 --> 00:03:23.936
this vector.

00:03:23.936 --> 00:03:27.270
The vector x minus v
looks like this.

00:03:27.270 --> 00:03:29.350
It looks like that.

00:03:29.350 --> 00:03:32.850
That is the vector
x minus v, right?

00:03:32.850 --> 00:03:37.330
If you take v plus x minus v,
you're going to go to x.

00:03:37.330 --> 00:03:40.730
So what I want to show is that
this distance, the length of

00:03:40.730 --> 00:03:44.810
a, of the difference between x
and its projection, is always

00:03:44.810 --> 00:03:48.880
going to be less than the
distance between x and any

00:03:48.880 --> 00:03:51.000
other vector in the subspace.

00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:54.450
So that is x minus v.

00:03:54.450 --> 00:03:56.830
So let's see if we
can prove that.

00:03:56.830 --> 00:04:00.260
So let's take the square
of this distance.

00:04:00.260 --> 00:04:05.230
So the square of x-- actually,
let me do that.

00:04:05.230 --> 00:04:08.180
Yeah, let me write that way.

00:04:08.180 --> 00:04:10.420
So we want to concern ourselves
with the square of

00:04:10.420 --> 00:04:16.320
the distance of x minus v, where
x is some vector in R3,

00:04:16.320 --> 00:04:18.970
and v is some vector
in R3 that's also a

00:04:18.970 --> 00:04:19.959
member of our subspace.

00:04:19.959 --> 00:04:20.959
It sits on this plane.

00:04:20.959 --> 00:04:23.650
So what's the square of
this going to be?

00:04:23.650 --> 00:04:29.250
Well, x minus v is equal
to this vector.

00:04:29.250 --> 00:04:31.430
Let me draw a new vector here.

00:04:31.430 --> 00:04:34.780
It is equal to this--
wait, let me draw

00:04:34.780 --> 00:04:36.130
it in in this yellow.

00:04:36.130 --> 00:04:39.480
It's equal to this vector.

00:04:39.480 --> 00:04:43.600
It's equal to this yellow
vector plus a.

00:04:43.600 --> 00:04:47.200
Right? x minus v is-- this
magenta vector that starts

00:04:47.200 --> 00:04:50.680
here and goes there-- clearly
equal to this yellow vector

00:04:50.680 --> 00:04:52.040
plus this orange vector.

00:04:52.040 --> 00:04:55.570
So let me call that
yellow vector b.

00:04:55.570 --> 00:04:57.430
Now, what is b equal to?

00:04:57.430 --> 00:05:07.120
Well, b is going to be equal
to this vector, this green

00:05:07.120 --> 00:05:15.540
vector, which is the projection
of x onto v, minus

00:05:15.540 --> 00:05:16.620
this purple vector.

00:05:16.620 --> 00:05:18.480
Minus this mauve vector,
I guess.

00:05:18.480 --> 00:05:19.340
Minus v.

00:05:19.340 --> 00:05:20.840
That's what b is.

00:05:20.840 --> 00:05:25.630
So we could write x minus v as
being equal to the sum of the

00:05:25.630 --> 00:05:33.405
vector b plus the vector a.

00:05:36.356 --> 00:05:39.830
So x minus v is equal
to b plus a.

00:05:39.830 --> 00:05:43.450
And if we're taking the length
of x minus v squared, that's

00:05:43.450 --> 00:05:49.500
the same thing as the length
of b plus a squared.

00:05:49.500 --> 00:05:57.460
And that's just equal to b plus
a dotted with b plus a,

00:05:57.460 --> 00:06:03.660
which is the same thing
as b dot b.

00:06:03.660 --> 00:06:05.190
Let me write that a
little bit neater.

00:06:05.190 --> 00:06:07.540
Let me write it down here.

00:06:07.540 --> 00:06:13.980
This is going to be equal to,
I'll switch colors, b dot b.

00:06:13.980 --> 00:06:17.270
Right, b dot b plus b
dot a plus a dot b.

00:06:17.270 --> 00:06:22.580
So plus 2 times a dot
b, plus a dot a.

00:06:25.470 --> 00:06:28.110
Now, a and b are clearly
orthogonal.

00:06:28.110 --> 00:06:32.040
b is the difference between two
vectors in our subspace.

00:06:32.040 --> 00:06:35.070
The subspace is closed under
addition and subraction.

00:06:35.070 --> 00:06:39.360
So b is a member of
our subspace.

00:06:39.360 --> 00:06:43.790
a is orthogonal to everything
in our subspace, by

00:06:43.790 --> 00:06:45.740
definition.

00:06:45.740 --> 00:06:51.040
So since a is clearly orthogonal
to b, a is-- by

00:06:51.040 --> 00:06:54.380
definition-- going to be in the
orthogonal compliment of

00:06:54.380 --> 00:06:55.210
the subspace.

00:06:55.210 --> 00:06:57.760
This is going to be 0.

00:06:57.760 --> 00:07:01.600
And then this right here
will simplify to

00:07:01.600 --> 00:07:04.010
the length of b squared.

00:07:04.010 --> 00:07:06.420
And then this right here
is going to be plus

00:07:06.420 --> 00:07:09.950
the length of a squared.

00:07:09.950 --> 00:07:14.540
So we get the distance between x
and some arbitrary member of

00:07:14.540 --> 00:07:20.860
our subspace squared is equal
to the length of b, right

00:07:20.860 --> 00:07:23.580
here, plus the length
of a squared.

00:07:23.580 --> 00:07:28.800
Now, a was a distance between
our vector x and our

00:07:28.800 --> 00:07:30.050
projection, right?

00:07:30.050 --> 00:07:33.040
That's what the definition of
a was. a was the distance

00:07:33.040 --> 00:07:35.100
between our vector x
and our projection.

00:07:35.100 --> 00:07:38.060
Now, this number right
here is going to be

00:07:38.060 --> 00:07:40.410
at least 0 or positive.

00:07:40.410 --> 00:07:42.440
So this right here is definitely
going to be greater

00:07:42.440 --> 00:07:45.710
than or equal to a squared.

00:07:45.710 --> 00:07:51.200
Or another way to say it is that
the distance between x

00:07:51.200 --> 00:07:54.950
minus v squared is definitely
going to be greater than or

00:07:54.950 --> 00:08:00.050
equal to the distance
of a squared.

00:08:00.050 --> 00:08:05.570
Or the distance between x minus
v-- this is still going

00:08:05.570 --> 00:08:07.910
to be a positive quantity,
length is always going to be

00:08:07.910 --> 00:08:10.950
positive-- is greater
than or equal to the

00:08:10.950 --> 00:08:12.680
length of vector a.

00:08:12.680 --> 00:08:15.620
Or what's that length of vector
a? a is just this thing

00:08:15.620 --> 00:08:16.070
right here.

00:08:16.070 --> 00:08:18.280
So let's write our result.

00:08:18.280 --> 00:08:24.170
The length of the vector x
minus v, or the distance

00:08:24.170 --> 00:08:28.440
between x and some arbitrary
member of our subspace, is

00:08:28.440 --> 00:08:31.240
always going to be greater than
or equal to the length of

00:08:31.240 --> 00:08:37.289
a, which is just the distance
between x and the projection

00:08:37.289 --> 00:08:40.730
of x onto our subspace.

00:08:40.730 --> 00:08:41.890
So there you have it.

00:08:41.890 --> 00:08:46.740
We've shown, and the original
graph kind of hinted at it,

00:08:46.740 --> 00:08:53.530
that the projection of x onto v
is the closest vector in our

00:08:53.530 --> 00:08:55.850
subspace to x.

00:08:55.850 --> 00:09:00.310
It's closer than any other
vector in v to our arbitrary

00:09:00.310 --> 00:09:01.855
vector in R3, x.

00:09:01.855 --> 00:09:04.300
And we've proven
it right there.
