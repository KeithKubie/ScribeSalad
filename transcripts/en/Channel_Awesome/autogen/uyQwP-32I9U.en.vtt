the end of movies like with 300 they did
that<00:04:57.199><c> I</c><00:04:57.500><c> think</c><00:04:58.330><c> some</c><00:04:59.330><c> of</c><00:04:59.419><c> the</c><00:04:59.479><c> mommy</c><00:04:59.660><c> movies</c>

00:05:00.010 --> 00:05:00.020 align:start position:0%
that I think some of the mommy movies
 

00:05:00.020 --> 00:05:02.230 align:start position:0%
that I think some of the mommy movies
are<00:05:00.199><c> doing</c><00:05:00.530><c> that</c><00:05:00.740><c> it</c><00:05:01.430><c> was</c><00:05:01.550><c> a</c><00:05:01.610><c> terrible</c><00:05:01.940><c> movies</c>

00:05:02.230 --> 00:05:02.240 align:start position:0%
are doing that it was a terrible movies
 

00:05:02.240 --> 00:05:04.180 align:start position:0%
are doing that it was a terrible movies
by<00:05:02.360><c> the</c><00:05:02.419><c> way</c><00:05:02.570><c> but</c><00:05:02.690><c> I</c><00:05:02.750><c> guess</c><00:05:03.080><c> um</c>

00:05:04.180 --> 00:05:04.190 align:start position:0%
by the way but I guess um
 

00:05:04.190 --> 00:05:06.310 align:start position:0%
by the way but I guess um
so<00:05:04.520><c> more</c><00:05:04.970><c> people</c><00:05:05.360><c> are</c><00:05:05.720><c> doing</c><00:05:05.990><c> sort</c><00:05:06.139><c> of</c><00:05:06.199><c> these</c>

00:05:06.310 --> 00:05:06.320 align:start position:0%
so more people are doing sort of these
 

00:05:06.320 --> 00:05:08.290 align:start position:0%
so more people are doing sort of these
big<00:05:06.620><c> collages</c><00:05:07.370><c> and</c><00:05:07.490><c> stuff</c><00:05:07.669><c> at</c><00:05:07.820><c> the</c><00:05:07.970><c> end</c><00:05:08.000><c> which</c>

00:05:08.290 --> 00:05:08.300 align:start position:0%
big collages and stuff at the end which
 

00:05:08.300 --> 00:05:10.980 align:start position:0%
big collages and stuff at the end which
technically<00:05:08.870><c> is</c><00:05:09.080><c> more</c><00:05:09.349><c> clever</c><00:05:09.909><c> because</c>

00:05:10.980 --> 00:05:10.990 align:start position:0%
technically is more clever because
 

00:05:10.990 --> 00:05:13.689 align:start position:0%
technically is more clever because
you're<00:05:11.990><c> looking</c><00:05:12.229><c> back</c><00:05:12.590><c> at</c><00:05:12.889><c> the</c><00:05:13.159><c> good</c><00:05:13.340><c> scenes</c>

00:05:13.689 --> 00:05:13.699 align:start position:0%
you're looking back at the good scenes
