00:00:00.500 --> 00:00:01.110
PROFESSOR: OK.

00:00:01.110 --> 00:00:07.350
This is one more thing to tell
you about Laplace transforms,

00:00:07.350 --> 00:00:12.650
and introducing a new
word, convolution.

00:00:12.650 --> 00:00:17.030
And so we're going to
find our old formula

00:00:17.030 --> 00:00:19.590
in new language, a new way.

00:00:19.590 --> 00:00:21.860
But the formula is familiar.

00:00:21.860 --> 00:00:26.850
And the problem is our
basic problem, second order,

00:00:26.850 --> 00:00:31.900
linear, constant coefficient
with a forcing term.

00:00:31.900 --> 00:00:34.140
And we know that the
Laplace-- and I'll

00:00:34.140 --> 00:00:36.650
take zero boundary conditions.

00:00:36.650 --> 00:00:39.870
So that the Laplace
transform is just

00:00:39.870 --> 00:00:51.950
s squared y, sy, and that's
the transform of our equation.

00:00:51.950 --> 00:00:53.250
No problem.

00:00:53.250 --> 00:00:57.270
OK, now I'll divide by that.

00:00:57.270 --> 00:01:02.260
So I move that as 1
over, and I call it G.

00:01:02.260 --> 00:01:12.450
So this G is 1 over s squared,
plus Bs plus C. And that

00:01:12.450 --> 00:01:15.890
has the name transfer function.

00:01:15.890 --> 00:01:22.270
And then this is the
transform of the forcing term.

00:01:22.270 --> 00:01:23.080
OK.

00:01:23.080 --> 00:01:29.210
So here we have a nice
formula for y of s,

00:01:29.210 --> 00:01:31.410
after I do that division.

00:01:31.410 --> 00:01:33.190
It's a product.

00:01:33.190 --> 00:01:36.670
The transform of the
solution that we want

00:01:36.670 --> 00:01:41.330
is that transform
times that transform.

00:01:41.330 --> 00:01:46.510
This is the transform
of the impulse response.

00:01:46.510 --> 00:01:50.470
This is the transform
of the right-hand side.

00:01:50.470 --> 00:01:54.890
Now I just have a Laplace
transform question.

00:01:54.890 --> 00:01:59.840
Suppose my transform
is one function of s

00:01:59.840 --> 00:02:07.120
times another function of s,
what is the inverse transform?

00:02:07.120 --> 00:02:08.720
What is the inverse transform?

00:02:08.720 --> 00:02:14.380
What function y of t
gives me G times F?

00:02:14.380 --> 00:02:17.665
And I'm just going
to answer that.

00:02:17.665 --> 00:02:27.904
The answer is the
g and the f, those

00:02:27.904 --> 00:02:29.070
are the ones that give that.

00:02:29.070 --> 00:02:32.430
But I do not just
multiply those.

00:02:32.430 --> 00:02:37.100
The new operation that
gives the right answer

00:02:37.100 --> 00:02:39.820
is called convolution.

00:02:39.820 --> 00:02:42.470
And I'll use a star.

00:02:42.470 --> 00:02:45.240
So right now I'm
going to say what

00:02:45.240 --> 00:02:48.230
does that convolution mean.

00:02:48.230 --> 00:02:50.300
So this is a general question.

00:02:50.300 --> 00:02:54.630
If I have two functions
multiplied together,

00:02:54.630 --> 00:02:57.120
then I want the
inverse transform,

00:02:57.120 --> 00:03:02.140
then I take the separate inverse
transforms, little g and little

00:03:02.140 --> 00:03:07.140
f, and I convolve
them, I do convolution.

00:03:07.140 --> 00:03:10.370
And let me tell you
what convolution is.

00:03:10.370 --> 00:03:18.190
So convolution is-- here is
the formula for convolution.

00:03:18.190 --> 00:03:27.000
It's an integral from 0
to t of one function--

00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:32.260
maybe I better use
capital T, better-- times

00:03:32.260 --> 00:03:36.480
the other function, integrated.

00:03:40.600 --> 00:03:42.940
That's what convolution is.

00:03:42.940 --> 00:03:45.640
So what have I achieved here?

00:03:45.640 --> 00:03:47.790
The same old formula.

00:03:47.790 --> 00:03:50.460
The formula which we
described way back

00:03:50.460 --> 00:03:55.500
at the beginning as
inputs f, growth factors

00:03:55.500 --> 00:03:58.630
over the remaining time, g.

00:03:58.630 --> 00:04:01.540
Put all those together
by integration.

00:04:01.540 --> 00:04:05.160
Put all the inputs with
their growth factors.

00:04:05.160 --> 00:04:07.820
Integrate to put
them all together.

00:04:07.820 --> 00:04:09.860
And that is y.

00:04:12.720 --> 00:04:18.149
So it's a familiar formula,
with only a new word.

00:04:18.149 --> 00:04:21.149
But you see that I could
jump to the answer,

00:04:21.149 --> 00:04:26.300
once I knew about the
convolution formula,

00:04:26.300 --> 00:04:32.650
and I knew that this is the
function whose transform its--

00:04:32.650 --> 00:04:33.660
let me say again.

00:04:33.660 --> 00:04:38.955
Its transform is GF.

00:04:42.750 --> 00:04:48.820
So if I multiply transforms,
I convolve functions.

00:04:48.820 --> 00:04:53.940
And looking at it the other
way, if I multiply functions I

00:04:53.940 --> 00:04:56.370
would convolve their transforms.

00:04:56.370 --> 00:05:01.560
So convolution grows
the number of functions

00:05:01.560 --> 00:05:04.740
that we can deal with
on Laplace transform.

00:05:04.740 --> 00:05:08.850
Because it tells us what to
do with products, capital G

00:05:08.850 --> 00:05:13.440
capital F. Or it tells us what
to do with little g little f.

00:05:13.440 --> 00:05:19.860
So I'm almost through,
because I don't plan to check.

00:05:19.860 --> 00:05:20.360
I could.

00:05:20.360 --> 00:05:22.770
But this isn't the right place.

00:05:22.770 --> 00:05:27.360
The book does it accurately.

00:05:27.360 --> 00:05:31.990
I don't plan to check that
this statement is true

00:05:31.990 --> 00:05:34.460
that the transform of
that one is that one.

00:05:34.460 --> 00:05:35.670
But it is true.

00:05:35.670 --> 00:05:38.640
But I do plan to do an example.

00:05:38.640 --> 00:05:42.560
Now second degree
gets a little messy.

00:05:42.560 --> 00:05:45.440
So let me do a first
degree example.

00:05:45.440 --> 00:05:55.210
Example, I'll take the
equation dy dt minus ay.

00:05:55.210 --> 00:06:01.650
That's our usual first
degree differential equation.

00:06:01.650 --> 00:06:06.140
And I'll take e to the ct
on the right-hand side.

00:06:06.140 --> 00:06:07.470
OK.

00:06:07.470 --> 00:06:11.390
I'm doing those, because I can
take the transforms and check

00:06:11.390 --> 00:06:12.100
everything.

00:06:12.100 --> 00:06:17.070
So let me transform both
of those starting from 0.

00:06:17.070 --> 00:06:25.680
So the transform of that is
s y of s, minus a y of s,

00:06:25.680 --> 00:06:29.430
equals, well I know
the transform f of s.

00:06:29.430 --> 00:06:34.070
I know the transform of
that is 1 over s minus c.

00:06:36.610 --> 00:06:39.800
So this is just, s
minus a factors out.

00:06:39.800 --> 00:06:50.600
So well y of s is 1 over
s minus a, and s minus c.

00:06:54.100 --> 00:06:59.740
Again, this is the simplest
differential equation

00:06:59.740 --> 00:07:04.480
with a forcing term that
I could use as an example.

00:07:04.480 --> 00:07:10.860
So now I'm looking for what is
y of T. I'm looking for y of T.

00:07:10.860 --> 00:07:17.350
And I'm now going to use
the language of convolution.

00:07:17.350 --> 00:07:22.240
This is the transform
of e to the at.

00:07:22.240 --> 00:07:26.020
This is the
transform of-- so you

00:07:26.020 --> 00:07:30.630
see I'm thinking of that as
the transform of e to at,

00:07:30.630 --> 00:07:38.410
and the transform of e to the
st. So there is one factor.

00:07:38.410 --> 00:07:39.785
And there's the other factor.

00:07:42.710 --> 00:07:47.250
So according to the
convolution formula,

00:07:47.250 --> 00:07:50.770
I can write down the
inverse transform, the y

00:07:50.770 --> 00:07:53.580
of t I want as the integral.

00:07:53.580 --> 00:07:57.680
I'm just going to
copy the convolution.

00:07:57.680 --> 00:08:01.670
But I know the
functions for that.

00:08:01.670 --> 00:08:05.010
So it's an integral from 0 to t.

00:08:05.010 --> 00:08:08.090
What do I have? g of t minus t.

00:08:08.090 --> 00:08:11.990
What is the inverse transform
of 1 over s minus a?

00:08:11.990 --> 00:08:18.940
It's e to the a t minus t.

00:08:18.940 --> 00:08:22.640
And what is the inverse
transform of 1 over s minus c?

00:08:22.640 --> 00:08:27.950
e to the cT dT.

00:08:27.950 --> 00:08:32.440
So I have used the-- I've
just put in what I know

00:08:32.440 --> 00:08:35.010
in the convolution formula.

00:08:35.010 --> 00:08:37.679
And this should be
the correct answer.

00:08:37.679 --> 00:08:40.409
And I can do this integral.

00:08:40.409 --> 00:08:42.860
And what do I get?

00:08:42.860 --> 00:08:53.390
Well, I'm pretty sure
that I get e to the-- down

00:08:53.390 --> 00:08:56.100
below there will be
a-- you see I'm going

00:08:56.100 --> 00:08:58.810
to combine those exponentials.

00:08:58.810 --> 00:09:02.050
So I'll have a c minus a.

00:09:02.050 --> 00:09:05.260
It comes out perfectly.

00:09:05.260 --> 00:09:12.895
e to the ct, minus e to the at.

00:09:17.420 --> 00:09:18.600
That's the right answer.

00:09:18.600 --> 00:09:23.570
It's not only what the
convolution formula tells me,

00:09:23.570 --> 00:09:25.880
it's what I know.

00:09:25.880 --> 00:09:31.620
So that example is a good
one to show that when--

00:09:31.620 --> 00:09:34.300
so I didn't use
partial fractions.

00:09:34.300 --> 00:09:38.230
Normally I would separate
this into partial fractions,

00:09:38.230 --> 00:09:43.670
and then I would recognize
those two pieces of the answer.

00:09:43.670 --> 00:09:45.260
I didn't do that this time.

00:09:45.260 --> 00:09:48.200
Instead of using partial
fractions, the algebra,

00:09:48.200 --> 00:09:55.190
I used the convolution formula,
and did the integral or almost

00:09:55.190 --> 00:09:56.980
did it.

00:09:56.980 --> 00:09:58.180
We can do it.

00:09:58.180 --> 00:09:59.860
And we get that answer.

00:09:59.860 --> 00:10:00.990
OK.

00:10:00.990 --> 00:10:06.400
So the point of
this video is simply

00:10:06.400 --> 00:10:10.230
to introduce the idea
of a convolution, which

00:10:10.230 --> 00:10:16.180
is the quantity we need,
the function we need,

00:10:16.180 --> 00:10:21.420
when the transform is a
product of two transforms.

00:10:21.420 --> 00:10:22.000
OK.

00:10:22.000 --> 00:10:23.800
Thank you.
