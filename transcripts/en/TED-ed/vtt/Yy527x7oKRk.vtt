00:00:06.433 --> 00:00:09.058
I think employment coordinator,

00:00:09.058 --> 00:00:11.130
and I'm going to let you know why --

00:00:11.130 --> 00:00:12.395
because I work at Intel.

00:00:12.395 --> 00:00:14.839
It's a very agile and dynamic company,

00:00:14.839 --> 00:00:17.783
and we go through something called a "reorg,"

00:00:17.783 --> 00:00:19.091
the joke is every year,

00:00:19.091 --> 00:00:21.737
but, you know, every one to three years.

00:00:21.737 --> 00:00:23.609
Even when you have a stable corporate job

00:00:23.609 --> 00:00:24.894
within the company,

00:00:24.894 --> 00:00:26.598
you get shuffled around a lot,

00:00:26.598 --> 00:00:28.554
and, you know, there's always this,

00:00:28.554 --> 00:00:30.683
"I don't think it's done very well."

00:00:30.683 --> 00:00:32.813
They always ask you for an assessment of skills,

00:00:32.813 --> 00:00:33.959
et cetera, et cetera,

00:00:33.959 --> 00:00:35.520
and then they try to reshuffle groups

00:00:35.520 --> 00:00:36.553
and make agile teams.

00:00:36.553 --> 00:00:37.689
So, even within companies,

00:00:37.689 --> 00:00:39.831
people are trying to make agile teams.

00:00:39.831 --> 00:00:42.796
And I see this as a continuing trend,

00:00:42.796 --> 00:00:44.045
and I think in the future,

00:00:44.045 --> 00:00:46.447
people are going to be more like consultants,

00:00:46.447 --> 00:00:47.852
that you're going to,

00:00:47.852 --> 00:00:49.014
I see a trend towards people

00:00:49.014 --> 00:00:50.695
wanting to own their own branch,

00:00:50.695 --> 00:00:52.490
to own their employability

00:00:52.490 --> 00:00:54.078
(in fact, that's a mantra,

00:00:54.078 --> 00:00:55.942
"Everyone own your own employability")

00:00:55.942 --> 00:00:58.455
and to see themselves as entrepreneurs.

00:00:58.455 --> 00:01:01.137
And I think that we will all have agents,

00:01:01.137 --> 00:01:03.531
and I think there will be agents within large companies,

00:01:03.531 --> 00:01:04.690
and I think there will be agents

00:01:04.690 --> 00:01:06.463
between small companies.

00:01:06.463 --> 00:01:09.103
So, I think that people who know people

00:01:09.103 --> 00:01:12.396
and get them optimally placed in the right jobs,

00:01:12.396 --> 00:01:16.553
I think that's going to be an efficiency builder

00:01:16.553 --> 00:01:19.260
for productivity worldwide.

00:01:19.260 --> 00:01:21.060
People will have agents.
