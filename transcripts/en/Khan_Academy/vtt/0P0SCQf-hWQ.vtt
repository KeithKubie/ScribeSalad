00:00:00.760 --> 00:00:03.790
Use elimination to
solve for x and y.

00:00:03.790 --> 00:00:07.020
And they gave us two equations
here-- x plus 2y is equal to 6

00:00:07.020 --> 00:00:09.830
and 4x minus 2y is equal to 14.

00:00:09.830 --> 00:00:12.360
So to solve by
elimination, what we

00:00:12.360 --> 00:00:15.160
do is we're going to add
these two equations together

00:00:15.160 --> 00:00:19.100
so that one of the two variables
essentially gets eliminated,

00:00:19.100 --> 00:00:20.430
gets canceled out.

00:00:20.430 --> 00:00:23.210
And what we could do right here,
we see we have a plus 2y here,

00:00:23.210 --> 00:00:25.970
and we see we have a
negative 2y right over here.

00:00:25.970 --> 00:00:27.856
So clearly if we added
these two together,

00:00:27.856 --> 00:00:29.480
the y's would cancel
out, and so that's

00:00:29.480 --> 00:00:31.190
exactly what we're going to do.

00:00:31.190 --> 00:00:33.740
We're going to add the
left side of this equation

00:00:33.740 --> 00:00:35.320
to the left side
of this equation,

00:00:35.320 --> 00:00:37.070
and the right-hand
side of that equation

00:00:37.070 --> 00:00:39.300
to the right-hand side
of the bottom equation.

00:00:39.300 --> 00:00:41.719
And just to make it clear
that this should make sense

00:00:41.719 --> 00:00:44.010
is we're just using both of
these constraints, whenever

00:00:44.010 --> 00:00:46.120
you learn about any
type of equation.

00:00:46.120 --> 00:00:49.580
So if I have x plus
2y is equal to 6,

00:00:49.580 --> 00:00:52.085
you learned early on
in algebra that you

00:00:52.085 --> 00:00:53.931
can manipulate this
equation in any way

00:00:53.931 --> 00:00:55.930
as long as whatever you
do to the left-hand side

00:00:55.930 --> 00:00:57.890
of the equation, you
do the right-hand side.

00:00:57.890 --> 00:01:00.310
If this is equal to
that, the only way

00:01:00.310 --> 00:01:01.790
that the equality
will still hold

00:01:01.790 --> 00:01:04.140
is whatever you do to this--
whatever you add to this

00:01:04.140 --> 00:01:07.492
or multiply it by-- you also
do to the right-hand side.

00:01:07.492 --> 00:01:09.200
So when we're adding
these two equations,

00:01:09.200 --> 00:01:10.533
that's exactly what we're doing.

00:01:10.533 --> 00:01:13.780
We could say, hey, let's add 14
to both sides of this equation.

00:01:13.780 --> 00:01:15.830
So you could add
14 on this side,

00:01:15.830 --> 00:01:17.490
you could add 14 on that side.

00:01:17.490 --> 00:01:20.440
That wouldn't be anything new,
but the second equation right

00:01:20.440 --> 00:01:25.060
here tells us that 4x minus
2y is the same thing as 14.

00:01:25.060 --> 00:01:27.140
So instead of adding 14
on the left-hand side,

00:01:27.140 --> 00:01:30.957
I could add 4x minus 2y.

00:01:30.957 --> 00:01:32.540
When we're adding
these two equations,

00:01:32.540 --> 00:01:34.669
we're really just
adding the same thing.

00:01:34.669 --> 00:01:36.960
You could view it as we're
starting with this equation,

00:01:36.960 --> 00:01:39.110
and then we're adding the
same thing to both sides.

00:01:39.110 --> 00:01:42.130
On the right-hand side it looks
like we're adding 14 to the 6.

00:01:42.130 --> 00:01:45.300
On the left-hand side it looks
like we're adding 4x minus 2y

00:01:45.300 --> 00:01:46.870
to whatever is on
the left-hand side.

00:01:46.870 --> 00:01:48.620
But the second
constraint tells us

00:01:48.620 --> 00:01:52.510
that 14 and 4x minus
2y are the same thing.

00:01:52.510 --> 00:01:55.150
So we're adding the same
thing to both sides.

00:01:55.150 --> 00:01:56.990
So with that said,
let's just do it.

00:01:56.990 --> 00:02:02.340
So the left-hand side, if we add
it up, we have x plus 4x is 5x,

00:02:02.340 --> 00:02:05.830
and then the 2y cancels
out with the negative 2y.

00:02:05.830 --> 00:02:08.150
And then on the right-hand
side we have 6 plus 14.

00:02:08.150 --> 00:02:10.329
6 plus 14 Is 20.

00:02:10.329 --> 00:02:12.370
So we're left with one
equation with one unknown.

00:02:12.370 --> 00:02:14.030
5x is equal to 20.

00:02:14.030 --> 00:02:17.250
We can divide both
sides by 5, and we

00:02:17.250 --> 00:02:20.790
are left with x is equal to 4.

00:02:20.790 --> 00:02:22.290
Now we can go back
and substitute

00:02:22.290 --> 00:02:26.020
in x equals 4 into either of
these equations to solve for y.

00:02:26.020 --> 00:02:27.620
So let's use this top one.

00:02:27.620 --> 00:02:32.150
So we have 4 plus
2y is equal to 6.

00:02:32.150 --> 00:02:35.660
We can subtract 4
from both sides.

00:02:35.660 --> 00:02:40.210
So then we get 2y is equal to 2.

00:02:40.210 --> 00:02:42.550
Divide both sides by 2.

00:02:42.550 --> 00:02:45.700
We get y is equal to 1.

00:02:45.700 --> 00:02:48.140
So the solution,
the x's and y's that

00:02:48.140 --> 00:02:51.420
satisfy both of these
equations, are x is equal to 4,

00:02:51.420 --> 00:02:53.180
and y is equal to 1.

00:02:53.180 --> 00:02:55.660
So this is the solution
for this system,

00:02:55.660 --> 00:02:57.240
or this coordinate
would be the point

00:02:57.240 --> 00:02:58.850
of intersection of
these two lines.

00:02:58.850 --> 00:03:00.130
And we can verify it.

00:03:00.130 --> 00:03:04.350
Let's verify that when
we put x is equal to 4,

00:03:04.350 --> 00:03:07.070
and y is equal to 1, in this
first equation it satisfies it.

00:03:07.070 --> 00:03:11.300
So we have 4 plus 2 times 1.

00:03:11.300 --> 00:03:12.790
That's 4 plus 2.

00:03:12.790 --> 00:03:14.895
That does, indeed, equal 6.

00:03:14.895 --> 00:03:16.770
And then the second
equation right over here,

00:03:16.770 --> 00:03:22.640
you have 4 times
4 minus 2 times 1.

00:03:25.150 --> 00:03:30.200
This is equal to 16 minus 2,
which does indeed equal 14.

00:03:30.200 --> 00:03:33.067
So it definitely does satisfy
both of these equations.

00:03:33.067 --> 00:03:33.650
So we're done.

00:03:33.650 --> 00:03:37.830
X is equal to 4,
and y is equal to 1.
