00:00:07.872 --> 00:00:09.720
DAWN LEE TU: I'm really
excited to be here

00:00:09.720 --> 00:00:12.390
with you this afternoon,
because the folks

00:00:12.390 --> 00:00:16.290
on this panel, such a wealth
of experience and knowledge.

00:00:16.290 --> 00:00:19.260
And I know they're
going to give you

00:00:19.260 --> 00:00:22.830
tons of things to take
away with you after you

00:00:22.830 --> 00:00:25.440
leave this afternoon.

00:00:25.440 --> 00:00:28.460
I have the privilege of
facilitating this panel,

00:00:28.460 --> 00:00:29.720
and you know what?

00:00:29.720 --> 00:00:33.570
We're just going to
dive straight in.

00:00:33.570 --> 00:00:36.360
So let's start off
with an easy question.

00:00:36.360 --> 00:00:37.230
All right.

00:00:37.230 --> 00:00:40.240
Let's start off with
an introduction.

00:00:40.240 --> 00:00:43.330
Tell us a little bit about
yourself, what you do,

00:00:43.330 --> 00:00:47.920
and what issue, in your
opinion, is impacting

00:00:47.920 --> 00:00:52.060
Asians and Asian-Americans that
really matters to you right

00:00:52.060 --> 00:00:52.780
now.

00:00:52.780 --> 00:00:55.960
So introductions and
what issue that's

00:00:55.960 --> 00:00:57.910
impacting Asians
and Asian-Americans

00:00:57.910 --> 00:01:02.660
that's really important and
matters to you right now.

00:01:02.660 --> 00:01:04.220
AIMEE PHAN: My
name is Aimee Phan.

00:01:04.220 --> 00:01:05.209
I am a fiction writer.

00:01:05.209 --> 00:01:07.721
I've written two
works of fiction.

00:01:07.721 --> 00:01:10.220
The first is a collection of
stories called "We Should Never

00:01:10.220 --> 00:01:13.300
Meet," which deals with the--

00:01:13.300 --> 00:01:16.204
there are eight
stories surrounding

00:01:16.204 --> 00:01:17.870
the events of Operation
Baby Lift, which

00:01:17.870 --> 00:01:20.930
was the emergency
evacuation of Amerasians

00:01:20.930 --> 00:01:23.390
and Vietnamese orphans days
before the Vietnam War.

00:01:23.390 --> 00:01:25.520
And my second book
is a novel called

00:01:25.520 --> 00:01:27.430
"The Reeducation
of Cherry Truong,"

00:01:27.430 --> 00:01:29.750
and it's about a
multi-generational Vietnamese

00:01:29.750 --> 00:01:32.330
family living in both
France and America.

00:01:32.330 --> 00:01:34.550
And so from both of those
books, and most of my work

00:01:34.550 --> 00:01:37.250
has been dealing with
stories about people

00:01:37.250 --> 00:01:39.270
from the Vietnamese diaspora.

00:01:39.270 --> 00:01:42.950
So my books are often
taught in college campuses

00:01:42.950 --> 00:01:45.146
and even high school campuses.

00:01:45.146 --> 00:01:46.520
And the issues
that often come up

00:01:46.520 --> 00:01:48.700
when I have these
discussions with them

00:01:48.700 --> 00:01:51.140
is about immigration
and refugee experiences

00:01:51.140 --> 00:01:54.710
and how people migrate
around the world

00:01:54.710 --> 00:01:57.410
and deal with the different
social, political, and cultural

00:01:57.410 --> 00:02:00.230
communities that
arise from history

00:02:00.230 --> 00:02:01.680
and what we can learn from them.

00:02:01.680 --> 00:02:04.179
And so I feel like that probably
is the most important issue

00:02:04.179 --> 00:02:07.550
that pops up in a lot of
my readings and panels

00:02:07.550 --> 00:02:13.010
and discussion is how do we
address the current immigration

00:02:13.010 --> 00:02:14.930
and the ongoing
immigration issues that

00:02:14.930 --> 00:02:17.670
are happening, not only in this
country, but around the world?

00:02:17.670 --> 00:02:20.670
How do we help other people
and other countries in need?

00:02:20.670 --> 00:02:24.260
And I think, especially the
Vietnamese community, we

00:02:24.260 --> 00:02:28.970
have a lot to say about it,
especially since our community

00:02:28.970 --> 00:02:35.264
was the last major migration
of refugees into America.

00:02:35.264 --> 00:02:36.680
We haven't had
another recent one,

00:02:36.680 --> 00:02:39.080
and I think that the
Vietnamese-American community

00:02:39.080 --> 00:02:43.280
can be seen as an example
of the incredible benefits

00:02:43.280 --> 00:02:46.125
and richness that can
happen when you are generous

00:02:46.125 --> 00:02:47.750
and when you are
compassionate and when

00:02:47.750 --> 00:02:50.450
you're exercising empathy, which
is I think something that's

00:02:50.450 --> 00:02:53.390
really important to
consider when we're thinking

00:02:53.390 --> 00:02:56.980
about a lot of laws that are
being enacted and proposed

00:02:56.980 --> 00:02:58.232
right now.

00:02:58.232 --> 00:02:59.660
DAWN LEE TU: Thank you, Aimee.

00:02:59.660 --> 00:03:01.160
ANOOP PRASAD: So
my answer, I think,

00:03:01.160 --> 00:03:02.800
ties into that quite a bit.

00:03:02.800 --> 00:03:03.800
My name is Anoop Prasad.

00:03:03.800 --> 00:03:06.080
I'm a staff attorney in the
Immigrant Rights Program

00:03:06.080 --> 00:03:07.180
at the Asian Law Caucus.

00:03:07.180 --> 00:03:10.210
The Asian Law Caucus is the
civil rights organization

00:03:10.210 --> 00:03:11.090
in San Francisco.

00:03:11.090 --> 00:03:14.450
We've been around since 1972.

00:03:14.450 --> 00:03:17.620
My work is largely
representing immigrants

00:03:17.620 --> 00:03:19.340
who are facing deportation.

00:03:19.340 --> 00:03:22.470
And my client base is largely
southeast Asian refugees--

00:03:22.470 --> 00:03:25.380
Vietnamese, Cambodian,
Hmong, [INAUDIBLE],,

00:03:25.380 --> 00:03:28.490
Mien refugees who came
here in the '70s and '80s

00:03:28.490 --> 00:03:30.800
and are now facing
deportation, largely

00:03:30.800 --> 00:03:33.570
for criminal convictions.

00:03:33.570 --> 00:03:36.230
And the experience is
really common across a lot

00:03:36.230 --> 00:03:39.260
of these refugee communities
of resettlement in the US,

00:03:39.260 --> 00:03:41.541
where the resettlement
process was really flawed.

00:03:41.541 --> 00:03:43.040
They were resettled
in neighborhoods

00:03:43.040 --> 00:03:45.800
that had really high
rates of poverty,

00:03:45.800 --> 00:03:49.010
high rates of unemployment,
high rates of incarceration,

00:03:49.010 --> 00:03:50.810
at the height of
the war on drugs.

00:03:50.810 --> 00:03:53.970
And a lot of them were funneled
into the prison system,

00:03:53.970 --> 00:03:55.880
the criminal system,
when they were teenagers

00:03:55.880 --> 00:03:58.840
and now decades later
are facing deportation.

00:03:58.840 --> 00:04:01.220
And it's become a
particular issue and problem

00:04:01.220 --> 00:04:03.650
as the Trump administration
has cracked down,

00:04:03.650 --> 00:04:06.320
especially on Vietnamese
and Cambodian communities,

00:04:06.320 --> 00:04:08.504
with deportation raids.

00:04:08.504 --> 00:04:09.920
And it's one of
those issues which

00:04:09.920 --> 00:04:12.320
gets overlooked a lot in
a lot of the narratives

00:04:12.320 --> 00:04:15.280
around Asian experience.

00:04:15.280 --> 00:04:16.456
DAWN LEE TU: Thank you.

00:04:16.456 --> 00:04:16.890
RUSSELL JEUNG: Hi, everybody.

00:04:16.890 --> 00:04:18.230
My name is Russell Jeung.

00:04:18.230 --> 00:04:21.690
I'm Chair of Asian-American
Studies at San Francisco State.

00:04:21.690 --> 00:04:24.750
We're celebrating our 50th
anniversary of the Third World

00:04:24.750 --> 00:04:28.810
Strike and the founding
of Asian-American Studies.

00:04:28.810 --> 00:04:30.930
I've been living for
the last three decades

00:04:30.930 --> 00:04:33.930
in a low-income Asian-American
community in Oakland.

00:04:33.930 --> 00:04:37.470
And there, I think I see
a lot of pressing issues

00:04:37.470 --> 00:04:40.530
facing low-income and
working-class Asian-Americans.

00:04:40.530 --> 00:04:43.360
And if you talk about--

00:04:43.360 --> 00:04:45.900
you're not supposed to talk
about an oppression Olympics,

00:04:45.900 --> 00:04:49.650
but I do think that people
living on the margin,

00:04:49.650 --> 00:04:52.080
living on the edge, do
face a lot more struggle

00:04:52.080 --> 00:04:52.810
and suffering.

00:04:52.810 --> 00:04:55.890
And so I have a lot
of unhoused neighbors

00:04:55.890 --> 00:04:57.090
who are Asian-American.

00:04:57.090 --> 00:04:59.400
I actually have students
at San Francisco State who

00:04:59.400 --> 00:05:01.870
are in Asian-American cities,
majoring in Asian-American

00:05:01.870 --> 00:05:04.610
Cities, living in their cars.

00:05:04.610 --> 00:05:08.400
And so issues of class and
intersectionality with race

00:05:08.400 --> 00:05:11.250
and immigration
and gender I think

00:05:11.250 --> 00:05:12.690
are really pressing
for our time,

00:05:12.690 --> 00:05:15.270
that a lot of the Asian-American
community isn't aware of.

00:05:15.270 --> 00:05:18.219
Besides homelessness,
on a broader scale,

00:05:18.219 --> 00:05:20.760
we're having mass displacement
of Asian-American communities.

00:05:20.760 --> 00:05:23.630
You can see Chinatowns
disappearing.

00:05:23.630 --> 00:05:26.130
You see a lot of gentrification
in low-income Asian-American

00:05:26.130 --> 00:05:26.720
communities.

00:05:26.720 --> 00:05:30.160
So I find that
really significant.

00:05:30.160 --> 00:05:31.180
DAWN LEE TU: Thank you.

00:05:31.180 --> 00:05:32.680
CHRISTINE MINJI
CHANG: Hi, everyone.

00:05:32.680 --> 00:05:35.580
My name is Minji Chang, and I'm
the former Executive Director,

00:05:35.580 --> 00:05:37.320
now Board Member
of Collaboration.

00:05:37.320 --> 00:05:39.760
And Collaboration is a
nonprofit organization

00:05:39.760 --> 00:05:43.500
and a grassroots movement
to unify, discover, connect,

00:05:43.500 --> 00:05:46.590
elevate Asian-American,
Pacific-Islander artists.

00:05:46.590 --> 00:05:50.100
So we deal with artists,
musicians, dancers, comedians,

00:05:50.100 --> 00:05:52.020
filmmakers, actors.

00:05:52.020 --> 00:05:56.920
I'm also an actor, now
writer, podcast host, emcee,

00:05:56.920 --> 00:06:00.240
et cetera, multi-millennial.

00:06:00.240 --> 00:06:02.510
That is my representation
on this panel.

00:06:02.510 --> 00:06:05.460
And the most pressing issue
that I'm interested in

00:06:05.460 --> 00:06:07.020
is definitely
diversity in Hollywood.

00:06:07.020 --> 00:06:09.780
That is my entire universe,
especially Asian-American

00:06:09.780 --> 00:06:14.610
representation, working within
and understanding the industry

00:06:14.610 --> 00:06:16.770
itself, but also the
implications that it has

00:06:16.770 --> 00:06:19.530
and the ripple effects of
representation in media

00:06:19.530 --> 00:06:22.590
in everything-- everyone on
this panel is talking about--

00:06:22.590 --> 00:06:25.920
on immigration, on politics,
on the economy and leadership

00:06:25.920 --> 00:06:30.480
roles in companies like Google,
the bamboo ceiling, everything.

00:06:30.480 --> 00:06:34.894
There's such a wide diaspora
of Asian-Americans, 99%

00:06:34.894 --> 00:06:36.185
of which never get represented.

00:06:36.185 --> 00:06:40.300
And it's just beginning to have
a voice in mainstream media

00:06:40.300 --> 00:06:42.210
and what the
dynamics of that are.

00:06:42.210 --> 00:06:45.720
And now I'm working on writing
films and shows so that I

00:06:45.720 --> 00:06:49.950
can contribute and continue
to talk in spaces like this

00:06:49.950 --> 00:06:51.520
to help make those connections.

00:06:51.520 --> 00:06:54.480
So for me, it's understanding
working in Hollywood,

00:06:54.480 --> 00:06:56.460
also connecting that
to other industries

00:06:56.460 --> 00:07:01.020
and other communities, because
this is much larger of an issue

00:07:01.020 --> 00:07:04.242
and a much larger
strategy is necessary.

00:07:04.242 --> 00:07:05.200
DAWN LEE TU: All right.

00:07:05.200 --> 00:07:08.310
So how does diversity, you
know, or if you want to use

00:07:08.310 --> 00:07:11.220
intersectionality, diaspora--
whatever your word is--

00:07:11.220 --> 00:07:14.070
show up in your
everyday life, and how

00:07:14.070 --> 00:07:17.354
does this impact your work?

00:07:17.354 --> 00:07:19.020
RUSSELL JEUNG: Well,
I was going to say,

00:07:19.020 --> 00:07:20.728
I think every
Asian-American and actually

00:07:20.728 --> 00:07:22.490
every individual
here will experience

00:07:22.490 --> 00:07:24.320
diversity in their families.

00:07:24.320 --> 00:07:28.350
So I'm actually fifth,
sixth generation American.

00:07:28.350 --> 00:07:33.340
And my family has gone through
exclusion, segregation,

00:07:33.340 --> 00:07:35.960
a lot of the racial barriers
that a lot of people of color

00:07:35.960 --> 00:07:37.010
face.

00:07:37.010 --> 00:07:39.440
But even within my own
immediate family, I'm married--

00:07:39.440 --> 00:07:41.390
I'm Chinese married to a Korean.

00:07:41.390 --> 00:07:44.900
We have two foster daughters
who are refugees from Burma.

00:07:44.900 --> 00:07:48.770
And then my extended family
are pretty multiracial.

00:07:48.770 --> 00:07:52.070
And so I think everybody,
even if your family

00:07:52.070 --> 00:07:53.600
was of the same
ethnicity, you know

00:07:53.600 --> 00:07:57.020
you have generational divides,
you have gender divides.

00:07:57.020 --> 00:07:58.930
And then when we go
out to eat, you're

00:07:58.930 --> 00:08:01.380
not always eating Chinese
food and rice every day.

00:08:01.380 --> 00:08:06.170
So I think we all experience
diversity in our relationships

00:08:06.170 --> 00:08:09.752
and in our histories and in
just our day-to-day interactions

00:08:09.752 --> 00:08:11.710
with people at our
workplace or at our schools.

00:08:11.710 --> 00:08:16.250
So diversity is totally relevant
in our circumstances in the US.

00:08:18.998 --> 00:08:20.970
DAWN LEE TU: Anybody
else want to jump in?

00:08:20.970 --> 00:08:22.420
CHRISTINE MINJI CHANG: Did you
want me to talk about that now

00:08:22.420 --> 00:08:24.240
or do you want me-- like, is
there another question when--

00:08:24.240 --> 00:08:25.830
DAWN LEE TU: I know Minji
is dying to talk about--

00:08:25.830 --> 00:08:26.735
CHRISTINE MINJI
CHANG: Well, I don't--

00:08:26.735 --> 00:08:27.260
DAWN LEE TU: [INAUDIBLE]

00:08:27.260 --> 00:08:29.300
CHRISTINE MINJI CHANG:
I'm curious-- well,

00:08:29.300 --> 00:08:32.850
one of my examples of how I deal
with diversity in my day-to-day

00:08:32.850 --> 00:08:35.669
life is that there's a
film coming out in August--

00:08:35.669 --> 00:08:38.940
August 17, FYI-- called
"Crazy Rich Asians,"

00:08:38.940 --> 00:08:43.159
and John Chu, who's
from the Bay, as am I,

00:08:43.159 --> 00:08:44.870
he's directing it.

00:08:44.870 --> 00:08:46.290
It's an ensemble
Asian-American--

00:08:46.290 --> 00:08:50.010
it's Asian-- it's actually a
global Asian cast, half of whom

00:08:50.010 --> 00:08:51.150
are Asian-American.

00:08:51.150 --> 00:08:56.250
And recognizing as a
data point, if you will,

00:08:56.250 --> 00:08:59.340
the fact that it's been
"Joy Luck Club," which

00:08:59.340 --> 00:09:02.160
was 25 years ago, was the
last, like, mainstream

00:09:02.160 --> 00:09:05.340
studio-backed ensemble
modern-day Asian-American

00:09:05.340 --> 00:09:08.990
family that was on screen,
it's a big freaking deal

00:09:08.990 --> 00:09:11.100
that it's been 25 years.

00:09:11.100 --> 00:09:12.977
And the fact that
there's the show,

00:09:12.977 --> 00:09:15.060
like, "Fresh Off The Boat"
and Dr. Ken, that there

00:09:15.060 --> 00:09:19.530
are these blips on the radar
about diverse representation

00:09:19.530 --> 00:09:23.010
of Asian-Americans that they
are so heavily weighted in terms

00:09:23.010 --> 00:09:26.280
of the gravity of, like, this
is representing all Asians

00:09:26.280 --> 00:09:27.110
when it's not.

00:09:27.110 --> 00:09:29.060
I mean, everyone
here knows that there

00:09:29.060 --> 00:09:32.040
are more than 46
ethnicities and cultures

00:09:32.040 --> 00:09:34.600
and lang-- like,
way more languages.

00:09:34.600 --> 00:09:38.040
But Asian includes so
many different people.

00:09:38.040 --> 00:09:42.180
And yet people are writing these
individual shows with these

00:09:42.180 --> 00:09:44.640
handful of actors to be,
like, the end-all-be-all

00:09:44.640 --> 00:09:46.170
representatives of diversity.

00:09:46.170 --> 00:09:48.294
That's a lot of pressure.

00:09:48.294 --> 00:09:50.460
It's a lot of excitement,
because diversity suddenly

00:09:50.460 --> 00:09:51.940
matters right now.

00:09:51.940 --> 00:09:54.780
So for me, the way I'm
experiencing it is I'm

00:09:54.780 --> 00:09:56.430
choosing to look
at the positive.

00:09:56.430 --> 00:10:01.110
I'm choosing to look at these
are opportunities and gateways.

00:10:01.110 --> 00:10:03.540
If this movie does
well, and it does matter

00:10:03.540 --> 00:10:06.330
that this movie does well, as
controversial as some people

00:10:06.330 --> 00:10:09.660
might be about this is
just Chinese people,

00:10:09.660 --> 00:10:13.050
and this is just about
Chinese in Singapore,

00:10:13.050 --> 00:10:14.010
did you read the book?

00:10:14.010 --> 00:10:15.780
Like, that's what
the book's about.

00:10:15.780 --> 00:10:19.950
And you cannot in one singular
movie define and represent all

00:10:19.950 --> 00:10:20.850
of Asian-America.

00:10:20.850 --> 00:10:24.330
But still, if this
film does well,

00:10:24.330 --> 00:10:27.270
it does open up doors for
so many other projects

00:10:27.270 --> 00:10:28.500
to get greenlit.

00:10:28.500 --> 00:10:31.020
And Asians do have a
representation in Hollywood.

00:10:31.020 --> 00:10:32.445
And whether this
is true or not--

00:10:32.445 --> 00:10:33.820
you know, I don't
know if this is

00:10:33.820 --> 00:10:35.280
an actual fact--
people will say,

00:10:35.280 --> 00:10:37.290
like, Asians don't
support each other.

00:10:37.290 --> 00:10:38.880
They don't watch
each other's shows.

00:10:38.880 --> 00:10:41.550
If we make a show or
film about Asian people,

00:10:41.550 --> 00:10:44.230
the numbers, like the
audience, doesn't reflect that.

00:10:44.230 --> 00:10:44.730
Right?

00:10:44.730 --> 00:10:47.800
So on a numbers and
business and industry basis,

00:10:47.800 --> 00:10:50.670
diversity is in my
wheelhouse, in my life,

00:10:50.670 --> 00:10:55.060
every single day in terms of
not just authentic storytelling

00:10:55.060 --> 00:10:57.800
but the business
of the data points.

00:10:57.800 --> 00:10:59.280
Who are the butts in the seats?

00:10:59.280 --> 00:11:00.390
How are we showing up?

00:11:00.390 --> 00:11:03.380
What kind of viewership
are we giving?

00:11:03.380 --> 00:11:06.150
And what does that do for
everybody moving forward

00:11:06.150 --> 00:11:07.710
in terms of getting
other projects--

00:11:07.710 --> 00:11:08.660
other stories-- told?

00:11:08.660 --> 00:11:09.410
DAWN LEE TU: Yeah.

00:11:09.410 --> 00:11:10.920
Well, let's test that right now.

00:11:10.920 --> 00:11:13.890
How many of you know "Crazy Rich
Asians" is going to come out?

00:11:13.890 --> 00:11:14.561
OK.

00:11:14.561 --> 00:11:15.060
OK.

00:11:15.060 --> 00:11:15.851
Here's a real test.

00:11:15.851 --> 00:11:19.260
How many of you actually
have it in your phone--

00:11:19.260 --> 00:11:20.840
the day-- and
you're like already

00:11:20.840 --> 00:11:22.212
organizing your friends?

00:11:22.212 --> 00:11:22.918
Anybody?

00:11:22.918 --> 00:11:23.418
OK, see--

00:11:23.418 --> 00:11:25.264
CHRISTINE MINJI CHANG:
A viewing party.

00:11:25.264 --> 00:11:25.930
DAWN LEE TU: OK.

00:11:25.930 --> 00:11:27.480
[INAUDIBLE]

00:11:27.480 --> 00:11:30.300
DAWN LEE TU: The point is,
like, representation matters.

00:11:30.300 --> 00:11:31.005
Right?

00:11:31.005 --> 00:11:31.360
CHRISTINE MINJI CHANG: Yeah.

00:11:31.360 --> 00:11:32.370
DAWN LEE TU: I think
that's what you're saying.

00:11:32.370 --> 00:11:33.045
CHRISTINE MINJI CHANG: For sure.

00:11:33.045 --> 00:11:33.753
DAWN LEE TU: Yes.

00:11:33.753 --> 00:11:35.040
Anything to add?

00:11:35.040 --> 00:11:37.410
AIMEE PHAN: Well, I think
what's interesting is the--

00:11:37.410 --> 00:11:40.650
I think the community support
is also really essential when

00:11:40.650 --> 00:11:44.450
you're talking about if an
Asian-American movie comes out,

00:11:44.450 --> 00:11:50.250
and I do understand the
instinct to critique

00:11:50.250 --> 00:11:51.740
and to be concerned,
because there

00:11:51.740 --> 00:11:53.730
has been so little
representation in the past

00:11:53.730 --> 00:11:55.440
that anything that
comes out we're

00:11:55.440 --> 00:12:00.030
so fearful of misrepresentation
and more misassumptions

00:12:00.030 --> 00:12:01.510
and biases.

00:12:01.510 --> 00:12:03.120
But that support
and that dialogue

00:12:03.120 --> 00:12:05.160
is incredibly important
for it to be fostered

00:12:05.160 --> 00:12:07.359
and to filter out
through the community.

00:12:07.359 --> 00:12:09.150
I think the same applies
to the literature.

00:12:09.150 --> 00:12:10.930
I think the same
applies to visual art

00:12:10.930 --> 00:12:15.630
and to other forms of
communication and bringing

00:12:15.630 --> 00:12:18.930
people together through art
to be able to articulate

00:12:18.930 --> 00:12:19.980
our experiences.

00:12:19.980 --> 00:12:23.310
And so that diversity
becomes pretty crucial.

00:12:23.310 --> 00:12:24.060
And I agree.

00:12:24.060 --> 00:12:26.160
Diversity happens--
like, the reason

00:12:26.160 --> 00:12:29.250
why I started writing was I
looked around the dinner table

00:12:29.250 --> 00:12:31.770
at my family and realized that
each of my aunt and uncles

00:12:31.770 --> 00:12:35.970
and cousins and my mom and my
dad and my grandparents all

00:12:35.970 --> 00:12:39.270
had a very unique migration
stories from Vietnam

00:12:39.270 --> 00:12:40.861
to America, all of them.

00:12:40.861 --> 00:12:42.360
They had very
different experiences.

00:12:42.360 --> 00:12:44.150
And that's within
a family, right?

00:12:44.150 --> 00:12:47.640
And so there has to be a
recognition and appreciation,

00:12:47.640 --> 00:12:49.830
I think, of that
diversity and being

00:12:49.830 --> 00:12:53.417
able to listen to each other
and foster that communication.

00:12:53.417 --> 00:12:55.500
DAWN LEE TU: And yet, there
still is this tension,

00:12:55.500 --> 00:13:00.600
right, this desire to recognize
specific and individual

00:13:00.600 --> 00:13:03.840
experiences with the Asian and
Asian-American communities,

00:13:03.840 --> 00:13:06.757
but then also we're
all this past month,

00:13:06.757 --> 00:13:09.090
you all have been talking
about how do we come together?

00:13:09.090 --> 00:13:12.300
How do we move forward together?

00:13:12.300 --> 00:13:14.715
So what are some examples
in which you've seen--

00:13:14.715 --> 00:13:17.440
and I'm thinking of you,
Anoop, in particular, right?

00:13:17.440 --> 00:13:19.780
You've seen people
negotiate that tension

00:13:19.780 --> 00:13:23.090
and find a way to build
coalitions and come together.

00:13:23.090 --> 00:13:24.840
ANOOP PRASAD: So
storytelling is something

00:13:24.840 --> 00:13:26.680
that's really important for
us at the Asian Law Caucus

00:13:26.680 --> 00:13:29.050
and telling our client
stories, and we're always--

00:13:29.050 --> 00:13:31.930
you know, we talk to thousands
and thousands of people

00:13:31.930 --> 00:13:32.950
every month, right?

00:13:32.950 --> 00:13:35.890
And the question always is,
like, which stories do we tell?

00:13:35.890 --> 00:13:38.440
And so for us, part
of that is determining

00:13:38.440 --> 00:13:41.710
who in our communities with all
this diversity has privilege.

00:13:41.710 --> 00:13:42.880
Who has the spotlight?

00:13:42.880 --> 00:13:44.230
Who has the microphone?

00:13:44.230 --> 00:13:45.010
And who doesn't?

00:13:45.010 --> 00:13:45.640
Right?

00:13:45.640 --> 00:13:48.970
So we try to use the
privilege that we have,

00:13:48.970 --> 00:13:50.620
the spotlight that
we have, to tell

00:13:50.620 --> 00:13:53.770
stories that aren't being told.

00:13:53.770 --> 00:13:58.160
And so the stories that do get
told, not just in Hollywood,

00:13:58.160 --> 00:14:01.600
but also over social media
or sort of in our communities

00:14:01.600 --> 00:14:04.250
leaves out a lot of people.

00:14:04.250 --> 00:14:07.810
I often jokingly refer to
myself as Asian-asterisk, right,

00:14:07.810 --> 00:14:09.580
because South Asians
are often left out

00:14:09.580 --> 00:14:13.180
of the narrative of
who's considered Asian.

00:14:13.180 --> 00:14:15.642
Pacific Islanders, we
say API, but really

00:14:15.642 --> 00:14:18.100
no one really thinks about or
talks about Pacific Islanders

00:14:18.100 --> 00:14:18.916
most of the time.

00:14:18.916 --> 00:14:21.040
The experience of a lot of
Southeast Asian refugees

00:14:21.040 --> 00:14:23.140
is also left out, and
you've got this very sort

00:14:23.140 --> 00:14:28.410
of East-Asian-centric
narrative about who's Asian.

00:14:28.410 --> 00:14:29.860
And so to some
degree, I think we

00:14:29.860 --> 00:14:31.360
should think about
those things when

00:14:31.360 --> 00:14:33.780
we're thinking about whose
stories are we telling.

00:14:33.780 --> 00:14:36.940
The stories of South
Asians in culture,

00:14:36.940 --> 00:14:39.940
it's the Quickie Mart owner, the
cab driver, and the terrorist.

00:14:39.940 --> 00:14:44.350
Like, those are the three
representations we have.

00:14:44.350 --> 00:14:46.360
There was this
Muslim ban happening,

00:14:46.360 --> 00:14:49.490
but it's not really
considered an Asian issue.

00:14:49.490 --> 00:14:51.179
So I think in some
degree when we

00:14:51.179 --> 00:14:52.720
talk about building
these coalitions,

00:14:52.720 --> 00:14:54.580
it's also important
to recognize who

00:14:54.580 --> 00:14:57.850
in our really diverse
community has privilege

00:14:57.850 --> 00:15:00.343
and to what degree can they
center these other stories that

00:15:00.343 --> 00:15:03.070
are being buffed out and help
tell those stories instead

00:15:03.070 --> 00:15:06.910
of occupying the spotlight
with their own stories.

00:15:06.910 --> 00:15:08.419
DAWN LEE TU: So
Russell, when you're

00:15:08.419 --> 00:15:10.960
teaching Asian-Americans, that
is, you're talking to students

00:15:10.960 --> 00:15:13.870
about this tension as well, what
are some of the stories that

00:15:13.870 --> 00:15:17.470
resonate with them about the
ways Asians and Asian-Americans

00:15:17.470 --> 00:15:19.720
have come together
as a coalition

00:15:19.720 --> 00:15:23.200
to be able to do things
like address injustice

00:15:23.200 --> 00:15:28.720
or address, maybe not
even the bad things,

00:15:28.720 --> 00:15:30.520
but just come
together in coalition.

00:15:30.520 --> 00:15:32.620
What are the stories that
resonate with students?

00:15:32.620 --> 00:15:35.430
RUSSELL JEUNG: Well, Aimee
was just involved in one.

00:15:35.430 --> 00:15:39.020
One of our classes on
Vietnamese-American literature

00:15:39.020 --> 00:15:42.410
did a poetry reading
around the Me Too Movement,

00:15:42.410 --> 00:15:46.120
and we found that
over half our class

00:15:46.120 --> 00:15:49.330
could relate to the issue of
domestic violence and abuse

00:15:49.330 --> 00:15:52.880
on a personal one-degree
of separation level.

00:15:52.880 --> 00:15:54.700
So there's a lot
of concrete issues

00:15:54.700 --> 00:15:56.380
around which we can
build solidarity

00:15:56.380 --> 00:16:01.150
that actually totally resonate
and that we can divide up

00:16:01.150 --> 00:16:05.350
that issue as being a racialized
issue, as a gender issue.

00:16:05.350 --> 00:16:08.720
And when people are able
to build, not only see

00:16:08.720 --> 00:16:11.554
their own families affected,
but also develop that empathy

00:16:11.554 --> 00:16:12.970
to build solidarity
with others, I

00:16:12.970 --> 00:16:16.190
think that's how
my students move.

00:16:16.190 --> 00:16:18.940
Hearing each other's
stories, both

00:16:18.940 --> 00:16:21.160
knowing the individual
uniqueness of that story,

00:16:21.160 --> 00:16:23.620
but making those
connections with others

00:16:23.620 --> 00:16:26.500
and seeing how race,
how transnationalism,

00:16:26.500 --> 00:16:31.750
how capitalism have shaped
these experiences to be similar

00:16:31.750 --> 00:16:35.980
and how we have a common sort of
target of fighting or resisting

00:16:35.980 --> 00:16:40.732
the suppression, I think
that's what mobilizes them.

00:16:40.732 --> 00:16:42.280
DAWN LEE TU: And
Aimee, how do you

00:16:42.280 --> 00:16:45.400
think about the
representation and then

00:16:45.400 --> 00:16:48.310
also which stories
to tell as you're

00:16:48.310 --> 00:16:51.720
thinking about the stories
that you yourself are writing

00:16:51.720 --> 00:16:54.730
and what you want to
share with the audiences?

00:16:54.730 --> 00:16:56.890
AIMEE PHAN: Well, my
mother was a social worker,

00:16:56.890 --> 00:17:00.020
and she worked with
a lot of children

00:17:00.020 --> 00:17:02.320
who came over as boat refugees.

00:17:02.320 --> 00:17:04.319
And she would work
on these case files,

00:17:04.319 --> 00:17:08.589
and it was really
important for her

00:17:08.589 --> 00:17:13.150
to express to her children
to understand the privilege

00:17:13.150 --> 00:17:17.250
that we came from, the fact that
we came over in the first wave,

00:17:17.250 --> 00:17:18.730
and that we had an education.

00:17:18.730 --> 00:17:21.870
We had opportunities that other
refugees and immigrants did not

00:17:21.870 --> 00:17:22.369
have.

00:17:22.369 --> 00:17:23.710
And so she was always--

00:17:23.710 --> 00:17:25.793
she wasn't a creative
writer, but she would always

00:17:25.793 --> 00:17:27.400
be sharing these
stories in order,

00:17:27.400 --> 00:17:30.600
like I said, to increase
my compassion and empathy

00:17:30.600 --> 00:17:31.517
and gratitude as well.

00:17:31.517 --> 00:17:33.475
Like, you need to be
grateful, and what are you

00:17:33.475 --> 00:17:35.620
going to do with the
opportunities that you have?

00:17:35.620 --> 00:17:36.880
And what stories can you tell?

00:17:36.880 --> 00:17:38.950
And so I think a
very huge reason

00:17:38.950 --> 00:17:41.530
why I wanted to become a
writer was I wasn't reading--

00:17:41.530 --> 00:17:43.880
at the time, there were no
Vietnamese-American books.

00:17:43.880 --> 00:17:45.588
There were very few
Asian-American books.

00:17:45.588 --> 00:17:47.500
The ones you had are
burned in my memories.

00:17:47.500 --> 00:17:49.166
I still remember
"Farewell to Manzanar."

00:17:49.166 --> 00:17:50.470
I remember "No-No Boy."

00:17:50.470 --> 00:17:52.900
I remember the very few
books on my bookshelf

00:17:52.900 --> 00:17:55.240
that actually
reflected my experience

00:17:55.240 --> 00:17:58.510
and what it felt like to be
someone in a predominantly

00:17:58.510 --> 00:18:00.470
white environment.

00:18:00.470 --> 00:18:05.680
And when a child especially
recognizes him or herself

00:18:05.680 --> 00:18:09.300
in a book, it is a validation.

00:18:09.300 --> 00:18:12.270
It's a self-validation
that empowers them.

00:18:12.270 --> 00:18:15.500
And I think that is something
that literature and art can do.

00:18:15.500 --> 00:18:18.730
And so that's why seeking out
those stories, understanding

00:18:18.730 --> 00:18:20.770
them, like I said, like
with Me Too Movement,

00:18:20.770 --> 00:18:23.186
it was part of a collective
called She Who Has No Masters.

00:18:23.186 --> 00:18:27.280
It's a collective of Vietnamese
women writers and gender

00:18:27.280 --> 00:18:28.352
non-conforming writers.

00:18:28.352 --> 00:18:29.810
And we wanted to
talk about Me Too,

00:18:29.810 --> 00:18:31.690
and we called it Me
Too, Vietnamese Bodies.

00:18:31.690 --> 00:18:33.700
What are the stories
that aren't being told?

00:18:33.700 --> 00:18:34.200
Right?

00:18:34.200 --> 00:18:38.425
Because the Me Too Movement
is rooted in social media

00:18:38.425 --> 00:18:40.030
and not-- and there
are many people

00:18:40.030 --> 00:18:41.570
who are not on social media.

00:18:41.570 --> 00:18:42.903
How do we collect these stories?

00:18:42.903 --> 00:18:45.350
How do we eliminate
a lot of that shame?

00:18:45.350 --> 00:18:46.402
And it's about listening.

00:18:46.402 --> 00:18:48.610
It's about listening and
then conveying these stories

00:18:48.610 --> 00:18:52.030
and talking with each other.

00:18:52.030 --> 00:18:57.180
TU: I know for me, coming
to understand and appreciate

00:18:57.180 --> 00:19:00.750
my own identity as a
Chinese-American in relation

00:19:00.750 --> 00:19:04.980
to my broader political identity
as an Asian-American was

00:19:04.980 --> 00:19:08.310
definitely a process, to
be able to see myself,

00:19:08.310 --> 00:19:12.780
and then to be able to see
myself as part of a community.

00:19:12.780 --> 00:19:14.660
What was that like
for some of you

00:19:14.660 --> 00:19:18.940
to understand the
sense of self-identity

00:19:18.940 --> 00:19:21.930
in connection to this
broader identity?

00:19:21.930 --> 00:19:23.700
What is something that
you want to share?

00:19:26.569 --> 00:19:28.860
AIMEE PHAN: I think it
happened, for me at least, late,

00:19:28.860 --> 00:19:32.670
and I think it might have been
just because the time period.

00:19:32.670 --> 00:19:35.250
I see it happening earlier
from my own children.

00:19:35.250 --> 00:19:37.080
My daughter, who
is nine, strongly

00:19:37.080 --> 00:19:39.090
identifies as a
Vietnamese-American--

00:19:39.090 --> 00:19:40.710
as a half Vietnamese-American.

00:19:40.710 --> 00:19:44.220
For me, growing up with a lot
of white people around me,

00:19:44.220 --> 00:19:47.029
I didn't feel proud until
college, which is late,

00:19:47.029 --> 00:19:48.570
but it was incredibly
liberating when

00:19:48.570 --> 00:19:50.130
it happened, because
that was when

00:19:50.130 --> 00:19:51.338
I started taking the classes.

00:19:51.338 --> 00:19:54.060
That's when the Vietnam
War was a taboo word.

00:19:54.060 --> 00:19:57.990
That's when there were classes
on issues, and histories,

00:19:57.990 --> 00:20:01.740
and literature that were about
the people who looked like me.

00:20:01.740 --> 00:20:04.530
And now I feel there are
more ethnic studies classes

00:20:04.530 --> 00:20:05.860
happening earlier in education.

00:20:05.860 --> 00:20:07.446
There are more
cultural opportunities.

00:20:07.446 --> 00:20:08.820
The Vietnamese
community has been

00:20:08.820 --> 00:20:11.690
here for longer, so we have--

00:20:11.690 --> 00:20:14.340
and now as the younger
generation is teaching

00:20:14.340 --> 00:20:16.907
the children, and so there
are more opportunities when

00:20:16.907 --> 00:20:17.490
they're young.

00:20:17.490 --> 00:20:21.060
But for me it didn't
happen until college.

00:20:21.060 --> 00:20:24.030
ANOOP PRASAD: So I grew up in
the deep south, in New Orleans,

00:20:24.030 --> 00:20:26.310
and I grew up in a black
and Vietnamese neighborhood

00:20:26.310 --> 00:20:30.100
with very few
South Asian people.

00:20:30.100 --> 00:20:32.730
And so I think I learned
early on that I'm not white,

00:20:32.730 --> 00:20:35.700
but in terms of
an Asian identity,

00:20:35.700 --> 00:20:37.156
it wasn't exactly clear.

00:20:37.156 --> 00:20:39.030
I mean, there were way
more Vietnamese people

00:20:39.030 --> 00:20:42.450
than South Asian people
in my neighborhood.

00:20:42.450 --> 00:20:46.770
But I think I definitely learned
about race in a much different

00:20:46.770 --> 00:20:48.594
way than it is in California.

00:20:48.594 --> 00:20:50.010
I very definitely
learned about it

00:20:50.010 --> 00:20:52.620
in terms of this black-white
binary that existed,

00:20:52.620 --> 00:20:55.044
and which side of
the line I was on.

00:20:55.044 --> 00:20:56.460
And so I'm still,
I think, getting

00:20:56.460 --> 00:20:58.230
used to being in California.

00:20:58.230 --> 00:21:00.951
I'm looking around the room,
I'm like, this does not really

00:21:00.951 --> 00:21:01.450
exist.

00:21:01.450 --> 00:21:04.055
And say I work at Oregon, and
it was 30-something people,

00:21:04.055 --> 00:21:06.720
and it's amazing radical
Asian lawyers there,

00:21:06.720 --> 00:21:10.039
but it's still mind-boggling
sometimes where I am,

00:21:10.039 --> 00:21:12.080
and it's easy to forget
here that Asians are only

00:21:12.080 --> 00:21:13.320
like 5% of the country.

00:21:17.170 --> 00:21:18.920
RUSSELL JEUNG: I grew
up in San Francisco.

00:21:18.920 --> 00:21:21.180
So it was easy
growing up in, like,

00:21:21.180 --> 00:21:24.110
if you're in an ethnic
enclave of, you know,

00:21:24.110 --> 00:21:26.190
90% Asian-Americans, it's
pretty easy to develop

00:21:26.190 --> 00:21:32.230
an Asian-American consciousness,
and to see the pan-ethnic

00:21:32.230 --> 00:21:33.237
commonalities--

00:21:33.237 --> 00:21:34.820
our generational--
it was really easy,

00:21:34.820 --> 00:21:36.695
because we were all
dressing alike, listening

00:21:36.695 --> 00:21:38.885
to the same type
of music, playing

00:21:38.885 --> 00:21:40.926
the same kind of sports,
going to the same clubs.

00:21:40.926 --> 00:21:45.550
So that was-- it became
a subculture that

00:21:45.550 --> 00:21:49.360
shifted to a political
identity as I began to see,

00:21:49.360 --> 00:21:52.150
yeah, I'm privileged in
some ways as a middle class

00:21:52.150 --> 00:21:55.030
Asian-American, but there
are other Asian-Americans who

00:21:55.030 --> 00:21:57.445
are suffering a lot
more-- people in Chinatown

00:21:57.445 --> 00:21:58.820
aren't getting
their wages, and I

00:21:58.820 --> 00:22:01.824
need to support-- give
them my privilege.

00:22:04.430 --> 00:22:08.410
CHRISTINE MINJI: I grew up
in Cupertino during the '90s.

00:22:08.410 --> 00:22:12.220
And if anyone was growing up
in South Bay in the Bay Area,

00:22:12.220 --> 00:22:14.650
or LA during the
'90s, if you guys

00:22:14.650 --> 00:22:17.119
remember, like, the
Asian pride era.

00:22:17.119 --> 00:22:17.910
RUSSELL JEUNG: AZN.

00:22:17.910 --> 00:22:19.395
CHRISTINE MINJI: AZN pride--

00:22:19.395 --> 00:22:22.880
special times-- that's actually
what my first film is about.

00:22:22.880 --> 00:22:27.010
But that was definitely
the post-riots--

00:22:27.010 --> 00:22:29.260
all these academic
things about the culture

00:22:29.260 --> 00:22:32.500
that I didn't know
until really recently.

00:22:32.500 --> 00:22:35.340
I just experienced
that, and road AZN pride

00:22:35.340 --> 00:22:39.260
on all my stuff, my screen name,
Xanga, AIM, all that stuff.

00:22:39.260 --> 00:22:44.450
So I was very immersed in
that Asian pride culture--

00:22:44.450 --> 00:22:48.250
that subculture,
but I didn't realize

00:22:48.250 --> 00:22:51.070
until I moved to Pleasanton--

00:22:51.070 --> 00:22:52.410
that was special.

00:22:52.410 --> 00:22:54.970
Well it's different now,
but at the time when

00:22:54.970 --> 00:22:58.540
I moved it was still
like 97%, 98% white,

00:22:58.540 --> 00:23:00.190
at the time that I
moved in the '90s.

00:23:00.190 --> 00:23:04.180
And it was a very stark
realization of being othered.

00:23:04.180 --> 00:23:06.100
And it wasn't
hostile or negative,

00:23:06.100 --> 00:23:08.020
but I was definitely
singled out,

00:23:08.020 --> 00:23:10.660
and they assigned me to
the other Asian girl.

00:23:10.660 --> 00:23:12.340
You should be
friends with Annie.

00:23:12.340 --> 00:23:13.990
And I was like, oh, OK.

00:23:13.990 --> 00:23:15.430
And I went with it.

00:23:15.430 --> 00:23:17.080
I was like, that's
my Asian sister.

00:23:17.080 --> 00:23:18.010
She is my friend.

00:23:18.010 --> 00:23:19.600
It was an automatic connection.

00:23:19.600 --> 00:23:23.680
So it was markers like that
that made me very aware,

00:23:23.680 --> 00:23:27.250
and in a way very prideful,
about being Korean-American,

00:23:27.250 --> 00:23:28.690
being Asian-American.

00:23:28.690 --> 00:23:31.870
But then navigating that and
coming to terms with it really

00:23:31.870 --> 00:23:34.060
happened, again, more towards
the end of high school

00:23:34.060 --> 00:23:37.439
and college, where there are
cultural organizations where

00:23:37.439 --> 00:23:38.230
we're talking more.

00:23:38.230 --> 00:23:41.290
But even in college I feel
like the conversations were not

00:23:41.290 --> 00:23:42.730
nearly as sophisticated as now.

00:23:42.730 --> 00:23:45.370
We did not have the
word intersectionality.

00:23:45.370 --> 00:23:47.610
I ran the Korean-American
student organization.

00:23:47.610 --> 00:23:50.890
We did community
service and we partied.

00:23:50.890 --> 00:23:52.720
We didn't talk that
much about identity.

00:23:52.720 --> 00:23:56.410
We didn't really dig into
what those dynamics were.

00:23:56.410 --> 00:23:59.290
We put on culture
shows as a celebration,

00:23:59.290 --> 00:24:01.430
but we wouldn't
really go in depth.

00:24:01.430 --> 00:24:04.420
So I feel like it's been
a very ongoing process,

00:24:04.420 --> 00:24:06.460
and then joining
Collaboration, and starting

00:24:06.460 --> 00:24:08.860
the Bay Area chapter
in 2009 was definitely

00:24:08.860 --> 00:24:12.520
an eye-opening
experience to the wider

00:24:12.520 --> 00:24:15.070
diversity of Asian America.

00:24:15.070 --> 00:24:17.140
And I'm continually--
I feel like now I'm

00:24:17.140 --> 00:24:19.600
going through
Asian-American studies.

00:24:19.600 --> 00:24:21.670
I wasn't interested in
taking those courses

00:24:21.670 --> 00:24:23.910
when I went to Cal.

00:24:23.910 --> 00:24:27.022
And they were available for
me, I just wasn't interested,

00:24:27.022 --> 00:24:27.730
which is bizarre.

00:24:27.730 --> 00:24:28.688
DAWN LEE TU: That's OK.

00:24:28.688 --> 00:24:30.100
We won't tell your teachers.

00:24:30.100 --> 00:24:32.016
CHRISTINE MINJI: Yeah,
please don't tell them.

00:24:32.016 --> 00:24:32.630
[LAUGHTER]

00:24:32.630 --> 00:24:37.750
DAWN LEE TU: So Minji, you
started touching on, I think,

00:24:37.750 --> 00:24:41.470
how things have changed
for you over time, right.

00:24:41.470 --> 00:24:45.040
So I want to reflect
a little bit on that,

00:24:45.040 --> 00:24:47.620
and think about
what is our future.

00:24:47.620 --> 00:24:50.680
What does our
community's future look

00:24:50.680 --> 00:24:59.530
like in terms of the diversity,
the identities, and our ability

00:24:59.530 --> 00:25:02.470
to-- what are we working on
in terms of coming together?

00:25:02.470 --> 00:25:06.520
So what do you all think
is in our future for Asians

00:25:06.520 --> 00:25:10.430
and Asian-Americans?

00:25:10.430 --> 00:25:11.870
[INAUDIBLE] it
was collaboration,

00:25:11.870 --> 00:25:13.490
because you probably see--

00:25:13.490 --> 00:25:16.710
I mean, you've seen so much,
and to a certain extent,

00:25:16.710 --> 00:25:19.080
the work that you've
done in collaboration

00:25:19.080 --> 00:25:22.730
is also very future-facing.

00:25:22.730 --> 00:25:24.050
CHRISTINE MINJI: Absolutely.

00:25:24.050 --> 00:25:25.820
I've been educated
more through the people

00:25:25.820 --> 00:25:27.569
I've met through
collaboration, because it

00:25:27.569 --> 00:25:30.240
was across North America,
including Canada,

00:25:30.240 --> 00:25:34.330
and understanding how different
my upbringing in the Bay Area--

00:25:34.330 --> 00:25:37.280
my privileged and very
diverse upbringing in the Bay

00:25:37.280 --> 00:25:39.800
is very different than
Detroit, Michigan,

00:25:39.800 --> 00:25:42.920
different than Atlanta, Georgia,
different than Washington, DC.

00:25:42.920 --> 00:25:46.700
And so that has been alone
just its own education.

00:25:46.700 --> 00:25:50.390
But what I see in my
peers, in the people who

00:25:50.390 --> 00:25:53.060
support us, and the
younger generation,

00:25:53.060 --> 00:25:57.680
because of social media, because
of YouTube, changed the game.

00:25:57.680 --> 00:25:59.750
There is more
conversation happening

00:25:59.750 --> 00:26:02.720
at a much more rapid pace
that's more sophisticated, more

00:26:02.720 --> 00:26:07.160
nuanced, and therefore I
think more just motivational

00:26:07.160 --> 00:26:10.880
for young kids to learn who
they are, love who they are,

00:26:10.880 --> 00:26:13.820
and just go out and
make amazing things.

00:26:13.820 --> 00:26:17.330
They don't have the same
level of self-consciousness

00:26:17.330 --> 00:26:20.660
or the same self-limitations
that we've all

00:26:20.660 --> 00:26:22.490
had to navigate for
different reasons,

00:26:22.490 --> 00:26:25.700
whether it be our
geographical location,

00:26:25.700 --> 00:26:27.470
or the way our
parents raised us.

00:26:27.470 --> 00:26:30.585
I inherited my 1980 version
of Korea from my parents.

00:26:30.585 --> 00:26:31.460
You know what I mean?

00:26:31.460 --> 00:26:33.260
I didn't grow up with
the current Korea.

00:26:33.260 --> 00:26:36.050
I go there, and I feel
very much othered there,

00:26:36.050 --> 00:26:38.150
as much as I'm Korean-American.

00:26:38.150 --> 00:26:41.420
So we have these very unique
stories, and I'm just--

00:26:41.420 --> 00:26:42.739
the coalitions are real.

00:26:42.739 --> 00:26:44.780
You know, the South Asian
community, everybody---

00:26:44.780 --> 00:26:49.190
I honestly think this
political climate, as awful

00:26:49.190 --> 00:26:53.360
as it is, it is a blessing in
disguise to get people to care

00:26:53.360 --> 00:26:54.470
and to move.

00:26:54.470 --> 00:26:57.090
So they're saying,
OK, fine, with

00:26:57.090 --> 00:27:00.630
this collectively marginalized
community, what we have to do?

00:27:00.630 --> 00:27:02.510
And that's creating
a lot of urgency

00:27:02.510 --> 00:27:06.481
to put aside whatever
competitive agendas and all

00:27:06.481 --> 00:27:06.980
that.

00:27:06.980 --> 00:27:10.250
And there is a lot more unity--
a lot more strategy I feel

00:27:10.250 --> 00:27:13.790
like, because now there's
the shared goal of, if we

00:27:13.790 --> 00:27:16.370
don't speak up for ourselves,
if we don't make it a priority

00:27:16.370 --> 00:27:20.660
to fund, get films greenlit, to
make sure to create programs--

00:27:20.660 --> 00:27:23.480
all the major studios have
diversity programs now.

00:27:23.480 --> 00:27:24.870
This did not exist.

00:27:24.870 --> 00:27:26.870
So this creates opportunities
for me as an actor

00:27:26.870 --> 00:27:29.600
that I didn't have, that it
was a different playing field

00:27:29.600 --> 00:27:31.550
five, 10 years ago,
and now they're

00:27:31.550 --> 00:27:37.370
creating diversity programs
where they're seeking out

00:27:37.370 --> 00:27:40.572
everyone of color,
LGBTQ, millennials.

00:27:40.572 --> 00:27:42.530
They're trying to get
different voices in there

00:27:42.530 --> 00:27:46.610
on purpose because people
are getting pissed off enough

00:27:46.610 --> 00:27:48.740
and inspired enough
to say, we want

00:27:48.740 --> 00:27:51.810
to see our
communities on screen.

00:27:51.810 --> 00:27:54.770
You can't whitewash us
out of our own stories

00:27:54.770 --> 00:27:58.800
and think we're going to
sit peacefully by and watch

00:27:58.800 --> 00:28:00.300
this nonsense, you
know what I mean.

00:28:00.300 --> 00:28:02.030
So I credit social media.

00:28:02.030 --> 00:28:04.790
That's why I'm so proud
to be from the Bay,

00:28:04.790 --> 00:28:07.370
and to have had my
roots in Silicon Valley,

00:28:07.370 --> 00:28:10.460
because things that are
happening in this place

00:28:10.460 --> 00:28:12.720
are changing the entire world.

00:28:12.720 --> 00:28:14.650
So I look to that, and
that is the future,

00:28:14.650 --> 00:28:17.010
in technology and all the
platforms that are emerging.

00:28:17.010 --> 00:28:19.460
You are not relegated
to, like, five studios

00:28:19.460 --> 00:28:21.320
running all of media.

00:28:21.320 --> 00:28:23.960
You have a lot more
voices, and people are

00:28:23.960 --> 00:28:26.510
getting scared, which is good.

00:28:26.510 --> 00:28:27.561
[LAUGHTER]

00:28:27.561 --> 00:28:28.560
Keep them on their toes.

00:28:28.560 --> 00:28:29.520
DAWN LEE TU: Go ahead
and jump in, Russell.

00:28:29.520 --> 00:28:32.000
RUSSELL JEUNG: Yeah,
can I bounce off that?

00:28:32.000 --> 00:28:33.270
So we have more platforms.

00:28:33.270 --> 00:28:35.570
We have more opportunities
to create a voice.

00:28:35.570 --> 00:28:37.790
I think emerging
Asian-Americans will become

00:28:37.790 --> 00:28:39.780
the creative class of America.

00:28:39.780 --> 00:28:42.080
If you look in academia
today-- if you look even

00:28:42.080 --> 00:28:44.660
in the world of
literature and arts,

00:28:44.660 --> 00:28:47.360
there's a lot of Asian-Americans
going into it because

00:28:47.360 --> 00:28:49.570
of selective immigration.

00:28:49.570 --> 00:28:52.880
Those coming in today are
educated professionals,

00:28:52.880 --> 00:28:55.442
and their kids are becoming
the creative class.

00:28:55.442 --> 00:28:56.900
So the creative
class are those who

00:28:56.900 --> 00:28:59.840
create culture, who create
the discourses by which we

00:28:59.840 --> 00:29:01.660
sort of understand the world.

00:29:01.660 --> 00:29:04.370
The danger, though, of
Asian-Americans becoming

00:29:04.370 --> 00:29:06.070
the creative class and--

00:29:06.070 --> 00:29:07.240
as I see this--

00:29:07.240 --> 00:29:09.584
sorry to jump on
Millennials is that--

00:29:09.584 --> 00:29:11.000
CHRISTINE MINJI:
Please, go ahead.

00:29:11.000 --> 00:29:12.605
RUSSELL JEUNG: We've all
become digital prisoners.

00:29:12.605 --> 00:29:13.480
DAWN LEE TU: It's OK.

00:29:13.480 --> 00:29:14.580
There's Q&amp;A afterward.

00:29:14.580 --> 00:29:15.187
[LAUGHTER]

00:29:15.187 --> 00:29:17.770
RUSSELL JEUNG: Everyone's sort
of trapped on their own phones,

00:29:17.770 --> 00:29:19.353
and we've become
hyper-individualized,

00:29:19.353 --> 00:29:23.090
and so that makes mobilizing on
a collective scales a lot more

00:29:23.090 --> 00:29:25.400
difficult. It's easier
to do social movements

00:29:25.400 --> 00:29:27.020
through social
media, but it also

00:29:27.020 --> 00:29:30.200
divides and conquers
us to be markets

00:29:30.200 --> 00:29:33.370
rather than communities.

00:29:33.370 --> 00:29:37.539
And so as we become
the creative class,

00:29:37.539 --> 00:29:40.080
I think we could redefine what
it means to be Asian-American.

00:29:40.080 --> 00:29:42.670
Nobody thinks of
Asian-Americans with a history

00:29:42.670 --> 00:29:45.880
of justice necessarily, or
an an ethic of compassion.

00:29:45.880 --> 00:29:48.150
But as we develop into
this creative class,

00:29:48.150 --> 00:29:50.180
and as long as we can
build those commonalities

00:29:50.180 --> 00:29:52.290
and solidarities,
and that empathy,

00:29:52.290 --> 00:29:54.160
and start working
not just on behalf

00:29:54.160 --> 00:29:56.750
of our own
self-interest, but out

00:29:56.750 --> 00:29:59.110
of the concerns for
low-income people

00:29:59.110 --> 00:30:00.890
or for other
marginalized groups,

00:30:00.890 --> 00:30:04.315
then we can actually
have possibilities

00:30:04.315 --> 00:30:06.190
to create our identity
that we want it to be.

00:30:06.190 --> 00:30:08.800
You know, Asian-Americans
being a just people,

00:30:08.800 --> 00:30:11.320
Asian-Americans being
a people of equity.

00:30:11.320 --> 00:30:15.550
So for me that's the hope,
that the term and the grouping

00:30:15.550 --> 00:30:20.224
of Asian-American has all
this unforeseen possibility.

00:30:20.224 --> 00:30:21.640
And people here
are the people who

00:30:21.640 --> 00:30:23.265
are sort of filling
in the gaps of what

00:30:23.265 --> 00:30:24.880
it means to be Asian-American.

00:30:24.880 --> 00:30:27.940
And so it's both exciting,
but we're also a little bit

00:30:27.940 --> 00:30:31.250
too imprisoned by our phones.

00:30:31.250 --> 00:30:32.534
DAWN LEE TU: Yeah.

00:30:32.534 --> 00:30:33.340
Go ahead, Anoop.

00:30:33.340 --> 00:30:35.465
ANOOP PRASAD: So I think
we're at a place of crisis

00:30:35.465 --> 00:30:37.548
and a turning point right
now about whether or not

00:30:37.548 --> 00:30:39.280
we take that plunge
towards being

00:30:39.280 --> 00:30:41.290
a community about justice.

00:30:41.290 --> 00:30:43.180
So we're the
fastest-growing community

00:30:43.180 --> 00:30:45.940
of color in the country,
even though we're still only,

00:30:45.940 --> 00:30:48.250
I think, five and
a half percent.

00:30:48.250 --> 00:30:52.580
And I think the country is in
this state of crisis right now.

00:30:52.580 --> 00:30:55.960
There's a war happening
over white supremacy, which

00:30:55.960 --> 00:30:58.420
has been happening this
country for centuries,

00:30:58.420 --> 00:31:00.490
but right now it's
out in the open.

00:31:00.490 --> 00:31:02.810
And so I think the
Asian community

00:31:02.810 --> 00:31:07.220
is at this place where it
needs to pick its sides.

00:31:07.220 --> 00:31:10.720
And for a really long
time, and by intention,

00:31:10.720 --> 00:31:13.900
we've been used as a weapon
against black people,

00:31:13.900 --> 00:31:15.520
and against people of color.

00:31:15.520 --> 00:31:17.710
Our immigration
system is set up so

00:31:17.710 --> 00:31:20.110
that it's only educated
Asians that are allowed

00:31:20.110 --> 00:31:22.360
to easily come to the US.

00:31:22.360 --> 00:31:25.480
And so we were always
held up by white supremacy

00:31:25.480 --> 00:31:27.370
as the good immigrants.

00:31:27.370 --> 00:31:28.460
We come here legally.

00:31:28.460 --> 00:31:31.270
We're not like our Latino
friends that cross the border.

00:31:31.270 --> 00:31:33.800
Were held up against black
people as, oh, you know,

00:31:33.800 --> 00:31:36.970
they're people of color but
they have really high graduation

00:31:36.970 --> 00:31:39.910
rates, and their incarceration
rates aren't high.

00:31:39.910 --> 00:31:42.165
Why can't black people
be like Asians, right.

00:31:42.165 --> 00:31:44.290
And that started almost
immediately after the Civil

00:31:44.290 --> 00:31:45.730
Rights movement,
was that we were

00:31:45.730 --> 00:31:47.770
pitted against other
communities of color.

00:31:47.770 --> 00:31:51.170
And to a large degree, a lot
of our communities at times

00:31:51.170 --> 00:31:52.930
have played into that.

00:31:52.930 --> 00:31:55.210
Sometimes that's
survival, of, we're

00:31:55.210 --> 00:31:58.930
going to try and be respectable,
and be the good immigrants,

00:31:58.930 --> 00:32:02.620
and it will get us as close
to whiteness as we can.

00:32:02.620 --> 00:32:04.787
There's this hierarchy where
we're never quite going

00:32:04.787 --> 00:32:06.244
to have the rights
of white people,

00:32:06.244 --> 00:32:07.570
but maybe it will get us close.

00:32:07.570 --> 00:32:11.200
And I think there is this
decision by some communities

00:32:11.200 --> 00:32:12.970
at certain times to
go along with that,

00:32:12.970 --> 00:32:15.951
because they needed to survive
as immigrants in this country.

00:32:15.951 --> 00:32:17.950
But in the end it's
becoming clearer and clearer

00:32:17.950 --> 00:32:20.606
that that isn't
going to protect us.

00:32:20.606 --> 00:32:22.980
The Muslim ban doesn't care
if you're respectable or not.

00:32:22.980 --> 00:32:25.420
It doesn't care
if you have a PhD.

00:32:25.420 --> 00:32:27.090
It doesn't matter.

00:32:27.090 --> 00:32:28.465
So I think we're
at this juncture

00:32:28.465 --> 00:32:30.580
of we need to decide
about whether we're

00:32:30.580 --> 00:32:33.150
going to be silenced
by white supremacy,

00:32:33.150 --> 00:32:35.260
quietly sort of play
into the respectability,

00:32:35.260 --> 00:32:38.302
or cast our lot with other
communities of color.

00:32:38.302 --> 00:32:39.760
And I think there's
a narrow window

00:32:39.760 --> 00:32:43.970
that we now have as a community
in making these decisions.

00:32:43.970 --> 00:32:44.720
DAWN LEE TU: Yeah.

00:32:44.720 --> 00:32:46.540
Aimee?

00:32:46.540 --> 00:32:50.230
AIMEE PHAN: I am very aware
that any success I have is

00:32:50.230 --> 00:32:53.820
due to community organizations.

00:32:53.820 --> 00:32:56.020
The organizations I
credited to become a writer

00:32:56.020 --> 00:32:58.279
are the Asian-American
Journal Association,

00:32:58.279 --> 00:33:00.070
the Diaspora of Vietnamese
Artists Network,

00:33:00.070 --> 00:33:03.070
and Asian-American
studies departments

00:33:03.070 --> 00:33:06.250
around the country that
help support my writing,

00:33:06.250 --> 00:33:07.520
and help support my book.

00:33:07.520 --> 00:33:09.580
And so it was
always built into me

00:33:09.580 --> 00:33:12.520
that if it wasn't for these
people who had been successful,

00:33:12.520 --> 00:33:15.610
and were looking to cultivate
the younger generations,

00:33:15.610 --> 00:33:16.970
I wouldn't have what I had.

00:33:16.970 --> 00:33:19.360
And so I think that made
me much more appreciative

00:33:19.360 --> 00:33:22.510
of how important community
organizations are

00:33:22.510 --> 00:33:25.660
in terms of influencing
generations and allyship.

00:33:25.660 --> 00:33:29.396
And that certainly applies to
this current political climate.

00:33:29.396 --> 00:33:31.270
And I realize that
sometimes social media can

00:33:31.270 --> 00:33:33.853
feel like a bubble, like you're
only talking to the people who

00:33:33.853 --> 00:33:38.470
are like you, but I do see,
since the election, more

00:33:38.470 --> 00:33:40.690
political activism,
and how we're going

00:33:40.690 --> 00:33:42.270
to use the resources we have.

00:33:42.270 --> 00:33:46.270
What superpowers do we have
to fight against the things

00:33:46.270 --> 00:33:48.110
that we're really
concerned about?

00:33:48.110 --> 00:33:54.070
And so I see graphic novelists
drawing and depicting

00:33:54.070 --> 00:33:56.620
cases of undocumented
immigrants.

00:33:56.620 --> 00:34:01.120
I see more writing, I see more
editorials, I see more art,

00:34:01.120 --> 00:34:03.100
and these are
fostering conversations

00:34:03.100 --> 00:34:05.892
and helping create dialogues
so that that threat--

00:34:05.892 --> 00:34:07.600
especially for
Asian-American communities

00:34:07.600 --> 00:34:09.580
to look inward and
only protect themselves

00:34:09.580 --> 00:34:11.199
can't necessarily
happen anymore.

00:34:11.199 --> 00:34:13.960
And I think
constantly reminding--

00:34:13.960 --> 00:34:17.380
and being reminded of the
fact that this happened

00:34:17.380 --> 00:34:19.690
to us just 40 years ago--

00:34:19.690 --> 00:34:21.639
just a little over
40 years ago, where

00:34:21.639 --> 00:34:22.764
everything was taken away.

00:34:22.764 --> 00:34:23.889
It can happen to any of us.

00:34:23.889 --> 00:34:25.250
So what are we going to do?

00:34:25.250 --> 00:34:26.750
How are we going
to help each other?

00:34:26.750 --> 00:34:30.429
And I think reminding
ourselves about that allyship

00:34:30.429 --> 00:34:33.560
and community
space is important.

00:34:33.560 --> 00:34:35.630
DAWN LEE TU: Thank you so much.

00:34:35.630 --> 00:34:42.070
I think between actually
calling us into this discussion

00:34:42.070 --> 00:34:45.250
about where are we going to
stand, what are we going to do,

00:34:45.250 --> 00:34:47.920
and how are we going to come
together, I think each of you

00:34:47.920 --> 00:34:52.280
in your own way
talked about that.

00:34:52.280 --> 00:34:52.780
All right.

00:34:52.780 --> 00:34:55.870
So it's your turn now.

00:34:55.870 --> 00:34:58.460
We've heard such rich
conversation up here.

00:34:58.460 --> 00:35:00.790
I want to make sure that
you all have an opportunity

00:35:00.790 --> 00:35:04.030
to ask questions, to engage
with the panelists as well.

00:35:04.030 --> 00:35:06.040
If you have a question,
please step up.

00:35:06.040 --> 00:35:08.620
There's a mic right here,
right in front of me.

00:35:08.620 --> 00:35:13.150
Please do that so that we can
get you on and we can hear you.

00:35:17.540 --> 00:35:18.380
Come on up.

00:35:18.380 --> 00:35:22.700
CHRISTINE MINJI: [INAUDIBLE]

00:35:22.700 --> 00:35:25.570
DAWN LEE TU: I didn't
pre-set any questions,

00:35:25.570 --> 00:35:27.931
so I don't have any plants
in the audience, so--

00:35:27.931 --> 00:35:28.430
yeah.

00:35:28.430 --> 00:35:30.960
OK, we have a
question right here.

00:35:30.960 --> 00:35:31.490
Come on up.

00:35:36.410 --> 00:35:38.540
AUDIENCE: My name is Grace Yu.

00:35:38.540 --> 00:35:41.940
Professor Jeung
had some thoughts.

00:35:41.940 --> 00:35:44.840
You know, he had thought the
phone was making our generation

00:35:44.840 --> 00:35:50.220
hyper-individualized, and that
we needed to move forward,

00:35:50.220 --> 00:35:52.210
and that Asian-Americans
hopefully would

00:35:52.210 --> 00:35:54.216
be sort of this just community.

00:35:54.216 --> 00:35:57.830
So granted that phones
aren't going to go away,

00:35:57.830 --> 00:36:01.810
I had a question for
you, Professor Jeung.

00:36:01.810 --> 00:36:04.030
How can we use the phone--

00:36:04.030 --> 00:36:09.200
I mean, Aimee, you suggested
that the phone, in some sense,

00:36:09.200 --> 00:36:12.515
has sort of galvanized
and organized folks.

00:36:12.515 --> 00:36:14.390
So I guess the question,
maybe for everybody,

00:36:14.390 --> 00:36:17.030
is how can we use technology--
it's not going to go away

00:36:17.030 --> 00:36:19.550
anytime soon, and people
will have their phones--

00:36:19.550 --> 00:36:21.410
how can we use
technology in a way that

00:36:21.410 --> 00:36:26.800
brings together community,
and moves our community along

00:36:26.800 --> 00:36:29.180
towards justice?

00:36:29.180 --> 00:36:30.920
DAWN LEE TU: Great question.

00:36:30.920 --> 00:36:32.450
Who wants to jump in?

00:36:32.450 --> 00:36:35.060
ANOOP PRASAD: So in my work
we actually use social media

00:36:35.060 --> 00:36:36.590
quite a bit to organize.

00:36:36.590 --> 00:36:39.205
And it's not by itself.

00:36:39.205 --> 00:36:40.580
There's also
organizing happening

00:36:40.580 --> 00:36:42.496
on the ground in
communities, but social media

00:36:42.496 --> 00:36:46.550
is really critical for a
lot of the advocacy we do.

00:36:46.550 --> 00:36:49.400
I mean, I remember,
Muslim ban 1.0,

00:36:49.400 --> 00:36:54.290
that first weekend where
it got signed Friday night,

00:36:54.290 --> 00:36:57.830
and we started working
that very night,

00:36:57.830 --> 00:37:01.100
and then I was blown away
by the number of people

00:37:01.100 --> 00:37:03.270
that we were able to
mobilize, and we've not

00:37:03.270 --> 00:37:05.480
been able to do that
without the internet.

00:37:05.480 --> 00:37:07.910
Our standard way of
mobilizing for an action

00:37:07.910 --> 00:37:10.490
is flyers, and word of
mouth, and that would not

00:37:10.490 --> 00:37:12.530
have turned out
thousands of people

00:37:12.530 --> 00:37:16.040
at every airport in the
country within a few hours.

00:37:16.040 --> 00:37:18.050
Often we run
anti-deportation campaigns,

00:37:18.050 --> 00:37:20.270
and you were mentioning
artists are really

00:37:20.270 --> 00:37:23.520
stepping up, and helping
tell stories through artwork.

00:37:23.520 --> 00:37:26.030
[INAUDIBLE] who's a really
amazing graphic novelist,

00:37:26.030 --> 00:37:28.280
has been helping us with a
lot of our anti-deportation

00:37:28.280 --> 00:37:31.190
campaigns, and making artwork
for online petitions, which

00:37:31.190 --> 00:37:33.440
have an enormous
amount of impact

00:37:33.440 --> 00:37:35.600
in getting people
free from detention,

00:37:35.600 --> 00:37:38.450
and also telling their stories.

00:37:38.450 --> 00:37:41.090
We use it to pass legislation,
we do call-in actions--

00:37:41.090 --> 00:37:44.990
all using social media--
using Facebook and Twitter.

00:37:44.990 --> 00:37:46.940
Sorry to plug
Google's competitors.

00:37:46.940 --> 00:37:48.860
[LAUGHTER]

00:37:48.860 --> 00:37:53.230
But it is really a critical
part of our work now.

00:37:53.230 --> 00:37:55.010
DAWN LEE TU: What
are you seeing,

00:37:55.010 --> 00:37:59.090
Minji, in terms of the
innovative ways performing

00:37:59.090 --> 00:38:01.605
artists are using technology?

00:38:01.605 --> 00:38:03.980
CHRISTINE MINJI: I think it's
been happening organically.

00:38:03.980 --> 00:38:09.440
And with being in a
generation that has grown up

00:38:09.440 --> 00:38:12.170
in a lot of our formative years,
and then with a new generation

00:38:12.170 --> 00:38:15.680
where they just are born
out the womb knowing how

00:38:15.680 --> 00:38:20.690
to, like, hashtag, people
get savvier by the day.

00:38:20.690 --> 00:38:23.450
And I think YouTube itself--

00:38:23.450 --> 00:38:26.900
Asian America, period-- everyone
credits YouTube for changing

00:38:26.900 --> 00:38:29.190
Asian America, because
the YouTubers--

00:38:29.190 --> 00:38:32.300
there is a specific generation
specifically between 2006

00:38:32.300 --> 00:38:33.804
and 2012--

00:38:33.804 --> 00:38:36.470
the content creators, because we
were not inundated with content

00:38:36.470 --> 00:38:39.120
at that point and they
were still early adopters,

00:38:39.120 --> 00:38:42.680
these celebrities that emerged
out of that YouTube generation

00:38:42.680 --> 00:38:45.590
still make a living
off of that today.

00:38:45.590 --> 00:38:48.260
It created a gateway
for Asian-Americans

00:38:48.260 --> 00:38:51.440
to influence a whole other
generation of younger

00:38:51.440 --> 00:38:53.355
Asian-Americans
to see themselves,

00:38:53.355 --> 00:38:54.980
because there's a
lot of kids out there

00:38:54.980 --> 00:38:56.480
who will look at
YouTube as a bigger

00:38:56.480 --> 00:38:58.767
deal than network television.

00:38:58.767 --> 00:39:00.350
They can identify
their YouTube stars.

00:39:00.350 --> 00:39:04.610
They can't identify Jimmy
Fallon, or whoever, right.

00:39:04.610 --> 00:39:06.380
And so it's just
really interesting,

00:39:06.380 --> 00:39:08.360
because that gave
people confidence,

00:39:08.360 --> 00:39:09.840
and it makes that ripple effect.

00:39:09.840 --> 00:39:11.423
I really believe in
the power of art--

00:39:11.423 --> 00:39:14.750
like a book, a song, or a skit.

00:39:14.750 --> 00:39:16.550
It's so random,
but it really gives

00:39:16.550 --> 00:39:19.490
a kid or an older person--
whoever watches it,

00:39:19.490 --> 00:39:22.070
they're like, oh, they get me.

00:39:22.070 --> 00:39:23.720
They get my story.

00:39:23.720 --> 00:39:26.460
Oh, and then they start
messaging each other.

00:39:26.460 --> 00:39:27.320
They share it.

00:39:27.320 --> 00:39:30.230
The sharing of videos, and
there's tweeting and all that,

00:39:30.230 --> 00:39:32.250
it has massive ripple effects.

00:39:32.250 --> 00:39:34.790
You don't know what kinds
of seeds that plants.

00:39:34.790 --> 00:39:37.910
And so I think the internet's
incredibly powerful.

00:39:37.910 --> 00:39:39.500
It can galvanize people.

00:39:39.500 --> 00:39:40.479
It motivates people.

00:39:40.479 --> 00:39:42.270
It pisses people off,
because they're like,

00:39:42.270 --> 00:39:43.700
oh, you made that skit.

00:39:43.700 --> 00:39:46.700
That was funny, but it was at
the expense of these people.

00:39:46.700 --> 00:39:48.260
I've seen these
conversations happen

00:39:48.260 --> 00:39:52.070
where young Asian-American kids
would kind of make a gay joke,

00:39:52.070 --> 00:39:55.100
and then that would cause a
whole conversation about issues

00:39:55.100 --> 00:39:56.630
within the
Asian-American community

00:39:56.630 --> 00:40:00.590
about not acknowledging
the LGBTQ community.

00:40:00.590 --> 00:40:03.440
And so then someone will go
out and make their own skit to,

00:40:03.440 --> 00:40:04.485
like--

00:40:04.485 --> 00:40:06.110
that's kind of the
age that we live in.

00:40:06.110 --> 00:40:07.480
There's tons of
content out there,

00:40:07.480 --> 00:40:09.300
but I think that that's
what needs to happen.

00:40:09.300 --> 00:40:10.910
It's not just theory
and our thoughts.

00:40:10.910 --> 00:40:13.444
We've got to do, we've got
to say, we've got to speak,

00:40:13.444 --> 00:40:15.860
and that's what's going to
keep maturing the conversation.

00:40:15.860 --> 00:40:18.151
That's what's going to make
content creators get better

00:40:18.151 --> 00:40:19.310
at what they do.

00:40:19.310 --> 00:40:21.110
I can sit here and
say, I'm a writer.

00:40:21.110 --> 00:40:24.110
But if I never put words
on a piece of paper--

00:40:24.110 --> 00:40:26.537
type it out, I'll
never get better.

00:40:26.537 --> 00:40:28.745
And I think that's a lot of
the things that I've seen

00:40:28.745 --> 00:40:31.110
in Asian-America is
that self-limitation,

00:40:31.110 --> 00:40:34.160
this fear of rocking the
boat, this fear of shaming

00:40:34.160 --> 00:40:34.850
our families--

00:40:34.850 --> 00:40:36.680
I can't air my
family's dirty laundry.

00:40:36.680 --> 00:40:40.080
Because all our stories are
so personal and very deep.

00:40:40.080 --> 00:40:42.110
But if we don't do
that, then we're

00:40:42.110 --> 00:40:43.365
just going to stay invisible.

00:40:43.365 --> 00:40:44.240
You know what I mean?

00:40:44.240 --> 00:40:48.590
So if you're a generation of
kids, and you can actually say,

00:40:48.590 --> 00:40:51.260
I don't like the Scarlett
Johanson casting.

00:40:51.260 --> 00:40:52.242
That's great.

00:40:52.242 --> 00:40:53.450
The world needs to know that.

00:40:53.450 --> 00:40:55.616
And then "Hollywood Reporter"
can write an editorial

00:40:55.616 --> 00:40:58.412
on that about the problematic
nature of whitewashing.

00:40:58.412 --> 00:40:59.870
And they'll bring
up Mickey Rooney.

00:40:59.870 --> 00:41:01.430
They'll bring up everything--

00:41:01.430 --> 00:41:03.440
you know, Bruce Lee
included-- everything,

00:41:03.440 --> 00:41:05.520
and then we can start
having those conversations.

00:41:05.520 --> 00:41:08.720
So sharing-- I believe in
every individual in here,

00:41:08.720 --> 00:41:10.850
just because you're not
an actor, or a writer,

00:41:10.850 --> 00:41:13.840
or a CEO, or
producer, or whatever,

00:41:13.840 --> 00:41:15.590
everyone through the
power of their phone,

00:41:15.590 --> 00:41:18.050
has the power of influence.

00:41:18.050 --> 00:41:20.160
Somebody is looking
at that data.

00:41:20.160 --> 00:41:23.030
Somebody is making
decisions based off of that,

00:41:23.030 --> 00:41:24.170
like viewership.

00:41:24.170 --> 00:41:26.330
There are artists that
are independent that

00:41:26.330 --> 00:41:28.250
make their living off
of YouTube viewership

00:41:28.250 --> 00:41:31.110
and get hired to
speak at colleges,

00:41:31.110 --> 00:41:33.272
or do a little music tour.

00:41:33.272 --> 00:41:34.730
They make their
living off of that.

00:41:34.730 --> 00:41:37.820
So those views, I know
for a fact, count so much.

00:41:37.820 --> 00:41:41.660
So don't ever take
yourself out of the running

00:41:41.660 --> 00:41:43.000
of your own influence.

00:41:43.000 --> 00:41:46.460
DAWN LEE TU: Russell, Aimee,
some quick last thoughts.

00:41:46.460 --> 00:41:48.680
RUSSELL JEUNG: Yeah, I
have a lot of thoughts.

00:41:48.680 --> 00:41:52.280
Technology isn't necessarily
organic in the development.

00:41:52.280 --> 00:41:55.100
It's capitalized,
and it's funded,

00:41:55.100 --> 00:41:58.240
and people are making
money off of technology.

00:41:58.240 --> 00:42:00.770
And I would argue
that technology

00:42:00.770 --> 00:42:02.690
has become the
opiate of the masses,

00:42:02.690 --> 00:42:04.310
that Asian-Americans
are so concerned

00:42:04.310 --> 00:42:07.090
about their representation,
and how they are seen,

00:42:07.090 --> 00:42:09.090
and whether we're invisible--
invisible to whom?

00:42:09.090 --> 00:42:10.340
I see my family every day.

00:42:10.340 --> 00:42:11.275
I see them.

00:42:11.275 --> 00:42:12.520
I know them.

00:42:12.520 --> 00:42:13.890
I know them by name.

00:42:13.890 --> 00:42:15.320
They are not invisible to me.

00:42:15.320 --> 00:42:16.340
I know their story.

00:42:16.340 --> 00:42:17.965
They don't have to
tell me their story.

00:42:17.965 --> 00:42:19.564
They're not voiceless.

00:42:19.564 --> 00:42:21.230
We're so concerned
about representation,

00:42:21.230 --> 00:42:23.720
but we're not concerned
about real people living

00:42:23.720 --> 00:42:25.620
in real conditions.

00:42:25.620 --> 00:42:28.880
So it's both/and that
our representations

00:42:28.880 --> 00:42:31.640
affect how we care about people
and their material conditions.

00:42:31.640 --> 00:42:33.080
Are they poor?

00:42:33.080 --> 00:42:34.670
Do they have health care access?

00:42:34.670 --> 00:42:36.990
Can they speak to a
doctor in their language?

00:42:36.990 --> 00:42:40.190
So I'm sort of concerned
for Asian-Americans

00:42:40.190 --> 00:42:42.030
who are so concerned
about representation,

00:42:42.030 --> 00:42:44.930
they got to get
outside of technology

00:42:44.930 --> 00:42:47.810
and start dealing with real
people in real situations,

00:42:47.810 --> 00:42:52.150
and develop a sense of
compassion and heart.

00:42:52.150 --> 00:42:54.080
So it's not just
about telling a story.

00:42:54.080 --> 00:42:57.316
It's about alleviating the
injustices and the poverty,

00:42:57.316 --> 00:42:59.690
and the struggles that a lot
of people are going through.

00:42:59.690 --> 00:43:03.410
Now a lot of Asian-Americans
who look like you and me

00:43:03.410 --> 00:43:05.054
if you're Asian-American--

00:43:05.054 --> 00:43:06.470
it could be like
your grandparents

00:43:06.470 --> 00:43:08.639
--are going through
really hard difficulties.

00:43:08.639 --> 00:43:10.430
And if all we care
about is representation,

00:43:10.430 --> 00:43:12.550
I think it's just
like, oh, I'm going

00:43:12.550 --> 00:43:16.280
to just watch another
YouTube video to de-stress.

00:43:16.280 --> 00:43:18.290
Social media is
causing Asian-Americans

00:43:18.290 --> 00:43:20.330
to have higher rates of
anxiety and depression

00:43:20.330 --> 00:43:22.960
now in this generation
than ever before.

00:43:22.960 --> 00:43:25.462
So it has its good things,
but we have to be aware--

00:43:25.462 --> 00:43:27.920
CHRISTINE MINJI: But that's
also residual from actual Asia.

00:43:27.920 --> 00:43:29.870
I mean, Koreans have
the highest rate

00:43:29.870 --> 00:43:33.440
of suicide in the
world, and alcoholism,

00:43:33.440 --> 00:43:34.820
and plastic surgery.

00:43:34.820 --> 00:43:37.702
And that's a documentary I would
like to make, to talk about it.

00:43:37.702 --> 00:43:39.410
They don't want to
talk about it, though.

00:43:39.410 --> 00:43:40.950
So I completely--

00:43:40.950 --> 00:43:41.820
[LAUGHTER]

00:43:41.820 --> 00:43:43.370
I'm learning so much.

00:43:43.370 --> 00:43:44.638
I really want to talk to you.

00:43:44.638 --> 00:43:46.350
[LAUGHTER]

00:43:46.350 --> 00:43:48.364
And this is great,
though, because I

00:43:48.364 --> 00:43:50.780
feel like there's just this
difference, because the people

00:43:50.780 --> 00:43:53.238
that I'm around-- the artists
that I'm around particularly,

00:43:53.238 --> 00:43:55.040
they care about
everything about that.

00:43:55.040 --> 00:43:57.230
So there's always
going to be pockets,

00:43:57.230 --> 00:43:59.090
a range of people who care--

00:43:59.090 --> 00:44:00.350
I'm just a beauty blogger.

00:44:00.350 --> 00:44:02.210
Just send me all the
sponsored products,

00:44:02.210 --> 00:44:03.501
and that's all they care about.

00:44:03.501 --> 00:44:05.120
Fine, but they
have influence when

00:44:05.120 --> 00:44:07.220
they start talking about
body image, and anxiety,

00:44:07.220 --> 00:44:11.600
and dysmorphia, anorexia,
eating disorders, whatever.

00:44:11.600 --> 00:44:14.000
And then you can have the
people who are very social

00:44:14.000 --> 00:44:15.500
justice-minded,
because when they

00:44:15.500 --> 00:44:18.050
see that only the things
that people are talking about

00:44:18.050 --> 00:44:20.830
are things about looking pretty
and your Instagram filter,

00:44:20.830 --> 00:44:23.270
it's going to cause a rise
out of people who are like,

00:44:23.270 --> 00:44:24.860
what about refugees?

00:44:24.860 --> 00:44:25.910
What about poverty?

00:44:25.910 --> 00:44:29.295
And they'll get motivated to
make those stories shine, too.

00:44:29.295 --> 00:44:31.170
DAWN LEE TU: I mean,
there's tensions, right?

00:44:31.170 --> 00:44:32.520
Aimee, you have the last word.

00:44:32.520 --> 00:44:35.103
AIMEE PHAN: Well, I think it's
the content in the social media

00:44:35.103 --> 00:44:37.220
that is making us anxious.

00:44:37.220 --> 00:44:38.930
There is a lot of
noise, but I think

00:44:38.930 --> 00:44:42.080
people can also become
really good about listening

00:44:42.080 --> 00:44:43.320
to what's important.

00:44:43.320 --> 00:44:45.567
A lot of those stories, we
wouldn't know about them

00:44:45.567 --> 00:44:46.900
if they weren't on social media.

00:44:46.900 --> 00:44:49.590
And I do think the reason why
representation is important,

00:44:49.590 --> 00:44:51.110
it becomes a gateway.

00:44:51.110 --> 00:44:53.540
Those stories are
important for us to feel.

00:44:53.540 --> 00:45:00.560
Most people, they are
motivated by their emotions

00:45:00.560 --> 00:45:02.060
rather than by facts.

00:45:02.060 --> 00:45:04.670
I didn't really understand--
or I didn't really

00:45:04.670 --> 00:45:07.310
feel the impact of so
many historical events

00:45:07.310 --> 00:45:10.160
until I read about it, about
even fictional characters

00:45:10.160 --> 00:45:12.560
experiencing that emotion,
going through these feelings

00:45:12.560 --> 00:45:16.250
of shame, or anger, or
frustration, or alienation.

00:45:16.250 --> 00:45:18.954
And that is how we create
compassion with other people,

00:45:18.954 --> 00:45:20.870
and that's how other
people learn our stories,

00:45:20.870 --> 00:45:22.740
and then they try to
make a difference.

00:45:22.740 --> 00:45:25.379
But if we don't have
those stories available,

00:45:25.379 --> 00:45:27.170
then we're not going
to have people curious

00:45:27.170 --> 00:45:29.960
to be able to hear more, and
listen, and pay attention

00:45:29.960 --> 00:45:31.700
to the very real
issues of the fact

00:45:31.700 --> 00:45:35.190
that there is an incredible
diversity in Asian-Americans,

00:45:35.190 --> 00:45:38.250
and that we have
the opportunities

00:45:38.250 --> 00:45:40.380
to help each other,
to help all income

00:45:40.380 --> 00:45:44.980
levels of Asian-Americans, and
see where we're coming from,

00:45:44.980 --> 00:45:47.370
and where we're supposed to go.

00:45:47.370 --> 00:45:49.860
DAWN LEE TU: Well I want
to thank each of you,

00:45:49.860 --> 00:45:53.890
Aimee, Anoop, Russell, Minji,
for contributing to a really,

00:45:53.890 --> 00:45:55.980
really rich conversation.

00:45:55.980 --> 00:45:57.980
Can we say thank you to them?

00:45:57.980 --> 00:46:02.230
[APPLAUSE]
