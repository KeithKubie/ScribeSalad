00:00:00.310 --> 00:00:02.170
The first rule of Mars life is....

00:00:02.170 --> 00:00:03.659
Don't talk about Mars life.

00:00:03.659 --> 00:00:14.160
Hi everyone, I'm Ian O'Neill, space producer
for Discovery News and I've commandeered the

00:00:14.160 --> 00:00:18.560
DNews video studio to share some news that,
well, kinda flew under everyone's radar.

00:00:18.560 --> 00:00:22.730
In case you didn't notice by all the rovers
and satellites we have orbiting Mars, we are

00:00:22.730 --> 00:00:24.419
fascinated with the Red Planet.

00:00:24.419 --> 00:00:28.570
We can't live there without a spacesuit because
the air is too thin and the planet is bathed

00:00:28.570 --> 00:00:29.570
in radiation.

00:00:29.570 --> 00:00:32.220
But it's the closest thing we have to Earth
in the whole solar system.

00:00:32.220 --> 00:00:35.940
There's been a recent flurry of science results
from NASA's Mars rovers.

00:00:35.940 --> 00:00:41.140
These results suggest that not only was Mars
once a very wet world, the water existed in

00:00:41.140 --> 00:00:45.410
a liquid state and was pH-neutral, or safe
to drink.

00:00:45.410 --> 00:00:48.680
So when you collect all the evidence, it's
not such a stretch of the imagination to think

00:00:48.680 --> 00:00:54.860
that basic lifeforms, like single-celled microbes,
once mingled in the Mars rock and soil millions

00:00:54.860 --> 00:00:55.860
of years ago.

00:00:55.860 --> 00:00:59.950
The next step would be to send a robot (or
even humans) to the surface of Mars to collect

00:00:59.950 --> 00:01:02.240
a sample of rock and launch it back to Earth.

00:01:02.240 --> 00:01:06.420
That way geologists and astrobiologists can
analyse the samples to look for ancient fossils

00:01:06.420 --> 00:01:07.420
of microbes.

00:01:07.420 --> 00:01:09.070
But nature is already one step ahead.

00:01:09.070 --> 00:01:13.230
Mars, like every planet in the solar system,
is smashed by asteroids and some of the Martian

00:01:13.230 --> 00:01:17.780
impacts have been so energetic that chunks
of the Martian crust have been blasted into

00:01:17.780 --> 00:01:18.780
space.

00:01:18.780 --> 00:01:25.710
After drifting for possibly millions of years,
these rocks may fall to Earth as meteorites.

00:01:25.710 --> 00:01:31.659
We know of hundreds of Mars meteorite examples
and these precious commodities have been studied.

00:01:31.659 --> 00:01:36.499
This pretty cool concept has led to the hypothesis
of "panspermia," where life may hitch a ride

00:01:36.499 --> 00:01:41.759
on meteorites and spread from planet to planet
like highly infectious interplanetary herpes....

00:01:41.759 --> 00:01:43.110
but that's a whole other story.

00:01:43.110 --> 00:01:44.719
Anyway, back to these new results...

00:01:44.719 --> 00:01:49.969
In February, NASA scientists published a paper
discussing tiny tunnels and holes inside a

00:01:49.969 --> 00:01:51.049
30 pound Mars meteorite.

00:01:51.049 --> 00:01:56.929
They say these structures are similar to "bio-alteration
textures" in glasses found on Earth formed

00:01:56.929 --> 00:01:58.549
by terrestrial microorganisms.

00:01:58.549 --> 00:02:06.450
They use terms like "biogenic origins" and
"biotic activity" -- but at no point the researchers

00:02:06.450 --> 00:02:08.659
mention the word "life."

00:02:08.659 --> 00:02:12.780
You'd expect every tabloid paper in the world
to have this splashed across their front pages.

00:02:12.780 --> 00:02:15.370
But the news just kinda sailed by.

00:02:15.370 --> 00:02:19.750
Other scientists praised NASA researchers
for avoiding speculative comments about finding

00:02:19.750 --> 00:02:21.299
signs of life on Mars.

00:02:21.299 --> 00:02:25.870
Just because this particular meteorite has
features that may have been created by tiny

00:02:25.870 --> 00:02:27.670
Martians doesn't mean that they were.

00:02:27.670 --> 00:02:29.510
This is science at its finest.

00:02:29.510 --> 00:02:34.019
While this is tantalizing evidence for life
on Mars, more studies are needed.

00:02:34.019 --> 00:02:41.549
And probably the only way that we will get
proof is when we can analyze a microbe's DNA,

00:02:41.549 --> 00:02:47.340
which is probably good enough reason for humans
to finally set foot on Mars carrying a microscope

00:02:47.340 --> 00:02:48.739
and forensics kit.

00:02:48.739 --> 00:02:50.790
Are you as excited by this finding as I am?
