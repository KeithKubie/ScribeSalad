00:00:00.532 --> 00:00:03.569
Byaah.

00:00:03.602 --> 00:00:07.707
(singing) Chappelle show.

00:00:07.807 --> 00:00:10.877 line:0%
Ladies and gentlemen,
I bring to you now Black Bush.

00:00:14.013 --> 00:00:16.015 line:0%
President Bush continues
to make his case

00:00:16.048 --> 00:00:17.717 line:0%
for an invasion of Iraq.

00:00:17.750 --> 00:00:19.419
After carefully
examining the region,

00:00:19.452 --> 00:00:21.020
me and my cabinet agree

00:00:21.053 --> 00:00:22.855
that that area is definitely
ripe for regime change.

00:00:22.888 --> 00:00:24.157
All right.

00:00:24.190 --> 00:00:25.491
But if I can be real about.

00:00:25.524 --> 00:00:26.993
Be real son.
Real?

00:00:27.026 --> 00:00:28.661
Be real, real, son.

00:00:28.694 --> 00:00:31.664
He tried to kill my father, man.
I don't play that shit.

00:00:31.697 --> 00:00:33.533
Say where they tried
to kill your father son.

00:00:33.566 --> 00:00:35.301
The (bleep) tried
to kill my father.

00:00:35.968 --> 00:00:38.104
Word to everything, we love
coming to see y'all, son.

00:00:40.639 --> 00:00:42.842
Meanwhile President Bush
and British Prime Minister

00:00:42.875 --> 00:00:44.911
Tony Blair offered
a spirited explanation

00:00:44.944 --> 00:00:47.080
for a possible war
with Iraq.

00:00:47.113 --> 00:00:50.116
This (bleep) very possibly
has weapons of mass destruction.

00:00:50.149 --> 00:00:52.952
I can't sleep on that.
Not on my watch.

00:00:52.985 --> 00:00:55.288
That's not how I roll.
That shit is serious.

00:00:55.321 --> 00:00:57.156
Now if you don't want
to take my word for it,

00:00:57.189 --> 00:00:58.491
why don't you ask
Tony Blair.

00:00:58.524 --> 00:01:01.327
He got a whole 'nother set of
intelligence. What's up Tony?

00:01:01.360 --> 00:01:03.329 line:0%
We don't know much about the ...

00:01:04.296 --> 00:01:06.365 line:0%
but we can't trust
random (bleep)

00:01:06.398 --> 00:01:09.769 line:0%
with things like that as George
so eloquently put it.

00:01:09.802 --> 00:01:13.406 line:0%
I'm with him 100% of the way.
We don't know what he has.

00:01:16.208 --> 00:01:18.878
If the United States
goes to war with Iraq

00:01:18.911 --> 00:01:21.180
will it first
have to provide evidence

00:01:21.213 --> 00:01:24.117
that Saddam Hussein has
weapons of mass destruction?

00:01:24.150 --> 00:01:26.886
So far the UN
has found nothing,

00:01:26.919 --> 00:01:29.255
but President Bush
counters with this.

00:01:30.189 --> 00:01:31.558
The (bleep) bought
aluminum tubes.

00:01:32.324 --> 00:01:34.794
Do I need to tell you
what the fuck you can do

00:01:34.827 --> 00:01:36.963
with an aluminum tube?

00:01:36.996 --> 00:01:40.033
Aluminum!
That don't scare you? Fine.

00:01:40.833 --> 00:01:42.435
I didn't want to say this.

00:01:44.370 --> 00:01:46.139
The motherfucker bought
some yellow cake.

00:01:46.172 --> 00:01:47.540
Okay. In Africa.

00:01:47.573 --> 00:01:49.475
He went to Africa
and he bought yellow cake.

00:01:49.508 --> 00:01:50.743
Are you sure?

00:01:50.776 --> 00:01:52.311
Yes I'm sure bitch.

00:01:52.344 --> 00:01:55.414
I got the head of the CIA
right here who will tell you.

00:01:55.447 --> 00:01:59.552 line:0%
Are you sure? Are you, I can't
believe you motherfuckers.

00:01:59.585 --> 00:02:01.387 line:0%
Let me tell you
something. Ridiculous.

00:02:01.420 --> 00:02:05.091
Ridiculous. Me and Jeb just
coming back from Africa.

00:02:05.124 --> 00:02:07.493 line:0%
Cradle of fucking civilization.

00:02:07.526 --> 00:02:09.562
This (bleep) out here
buying yellow cake.

00:02:09.595 --> 00:02:11.330
From the motherland.

00:02:11.363 --> 00:02:13.199
Are you sure it was yellow cake?

00:02:13.232 --> 00:02:16.068
Y'all (bleep) don't believe me,
I got some yellow cake right
here.

00:02:16.101 --> 00:02:17.703
Look? You see?
You believe this shit now?

00:02:17.736 --> 00:02:19.105
Don't drop that shit.

00:02:19.138 --> 00:02:21.374
I know.
I know what to do with it.

00:02:21.407 --> 00:02:23.943
That's why I got it wrapped up
in this special CIA napkin.

00:02:23.976 --> 00:02:25.845
Don't drop that shit, yeah.

00:02:25.878 --> 00:02:27.213
You hope I don't drop this shit.

00:02:27.246 --> 00:02:29.115
Pray to God you don't
drop that shit.

00:02:29.148 --> 00:02:30.383
Yellow cake.

00:02:30.416 --> 00:02:32.051
Fucking right.

00:02:33.452 --> 00:02:35.588
A sensitive accusation for this
administration

00:02:35.621 --> 00:02:38.858
is the theory held by many
that the real reason the US

00:02:38.891 --> 00:02:41.427
is so interested
in toppling Saddam

00:02:41.460 --> 00:02:44.430
is control of the oil
that Iraq is sitting on.

00:02:44.463 --> 00:02:45.965
What about people who say
you're only interested

00:02:45.998 --> 00:02:47.633
in the Middle East for oil?

00:02:47.666 --> 00:02:49.836
What? Huh oil?

00:02:51.470 --> 00:02:53.506
Who said something
oil bitch, you cooking?

00:02:54.306 --> 00:02:58.845
Oil? I don't know what ...
come on y'all get out of here.

00:03:01.280 --> 00:03:04.250
President Bush met with
UN Secretary General Kofi Annan

00:03:04.283 --> 00:03:09.288
and made it clear the US will
act even if the UN is reluctant.

00:03:09.321 --> 00:03:11.791
UN? You have a problem with
that? You know what you should
do?

00:03:11.824 --> 00:03:14.894
You should sanction me.
Sanction me with your army.

00:03:14.927 --> 00:03:17.797
Oh! Wait a minute!
You don't have an army.

00:03:18.430 --> 00:03:20.600
I guess that means you need
to shut the fuck up.

00:03:20.633 --> 00:03:22.134
That's what I would
if I didn't have an army.

00:03:22.167 --> 00:03:23.636
I would shut the fuck up.

00:03:23.669 --> 00:03:27.506
Shut the fuck up.
That's right. Kofi Annan.

00:03:27.539 --> 00:03:29.475
Think I'm gonna take orders
from an African?

00:03:29.508 --> 00:03:31.744
You might speak 16 languages,
but you gonna need 'em

00:03:31.777 --> 00:03:33.946
when you in Times Square
selling fake hats.

00:03:33.979 --> 00:03:36.049
I know Gucci when I see
it (bleep), I'm rich.

00:03:36.815 --> 00:03:39.285
I got a coalition
of the willing.

00:03:39.318 --> 00:03:42.188
I got 40 nations
ready to roll son!

00:03:42.855 --> 00:03:44.290
Like who?

00:03:44.323 --> 00:03:47.694
Who the fuck said that? Huh?
Huh? Like who?

00:03:49.128 --> 00:03:51.965
England.
Japan's sending PlayStations.

00:03:53.565 --> 00:03:55.835
... said they're willing to
drop bombs over Baghdad.

00:03:56.502 --> 00:03:58.471
Riggity Row is coming.

00:03:58.504 --> 00:04:00.373
Afrika Bambaataa
and the Zulu nation.

00:04:01.340 --> 00:04:03.609
This means I am not
doing this by myself

00:04:03.642 --> 00:04:07.046
and I'm not disrespecting
the UN

00:04:07.079 --> 00:04:08.514
even though
they don't got no army.

00:04:09.715 --> 00:04:14.253
Go sell some medicine bitches.
I'm trying to get that oil.

00:04:14.286 --> 00:04:15.288 line:92%
Oh ho!

00:04:20.693 --> 00:04:23.462
The US fired the opening salvo
in the war on Iraq

00:04:23.495 --> 00:04:25.464
with at least 40 Tomahawk
cruise missiles

00:04:25.497 --> 00:04:28.101
and precision guided bombs,
centering on Baghdad.

00:04:30.402 --> 00:04:32.705
Good evening. Tonight
President George Bush

00:04:32.738 --> 00:04:34.373
is onboard the aircraft carrier

00:04:34.406 --> 00:04:37.576
USS Abraham Lincoln
off the California coast.

00:04:37.609 --> 00:04:40.813
It will be the sight of what is
essentially his victory speech

00:04:40.846 --> 00:04:42.215
in the war against Iraq.

00:04:44.416 --> 00:04:45.751
What did I say?

00:04:45.784 --> 00:04:47.386
I'm not gloating,
but what did I say?

00:04:47.419 --> 00:04:49.755
Did I not say
that we will win that shit?

00:04:49.788 --> 00:04:52.158
We rocked them families.
We rocked 'em.

00:04:52.191 --> 00:04:53.926
Man did you see me
coming on that plane?

00:04:59.064 --> 00:05:01.200
For the second straight day
these hard line

00:05:01.233 --> 00:05:03.569
Iraqis protested
the American presence here.

00:05:05.404 --> 00:05:06.839
Mr. President when do you think

00:05:06.872 --> 00:05:09.375
they'll hold
general elections in Iraq?

00:05:09.408 --> 00:05:11.110
Damn I knew I shouldn't
have called on this (bleep).

00:05:11.143 --> 00:05:12.778
I should not have
called on you

00:05:12.811 --> 00:05:14.747
'cause you always trying
to distract motherfuckers

00:05:14.780 --> 00:05:17.450
with things like the war
and skirt all the real issues.

00:05:19.284 --> 00:05:21.020
Gay people are getting
married folks.

00:05:21.053 --> 00:05:25.325
Yes. Nasty.
Imagine that. Two women.

00:05:26.558 --> 00:05:28.394
Touching on each other's
titty balls.

00:05:29.328 --> 00:05:32.064
Caressing them.
Gently stroking those nipples

00:05:32.097 --> 00:05:35.268
'til they get just
so stiff and erect.

00:05:36.001 --> 00:05:36.736
Blowing on 'em.

00:05:42.908 --> 00:05:45.745
Men, barbecue, "I like you."

00:05:45.778 --> 00:05:48.547
"I like you too dog.
Let's get married man."

00:05:48.580 --> 00:05:49.749
It's crazy.

00:05:49.782 --> 00:05:51.083
What about your re-

00:05:51.116 --> 00:05:52.752
That shit is gross.

00:05:56.188 --> 00:05:58.424
Mr. President, Mr. President
sir,

00:05:58.457 --> 00:06:01.293
how do you explain
the continual upheaval in Iraq

00:06:01.326 --> 00:06:03.129
even after the capture
of Saddam Hussein?

00:06:04.163 --> 00:06:05.798
Why you doing this man?

00:06:06.598 --> 00:06:07.833
I thought you's
my black brother.

00:06:07.866 --> 00:06:09.935
Why you ask me
questions like that?

00:06:09.968 --> 00:06:12.004
Fine I'll answer your stupid
ass question.

00:06:12.037 --> 00:06:13.472
Here's what I feel about Iraq.

00:06:13.505 --> 00:06:15.641
I feel like you guys keep trying
to distract people

00:06:15.674 --> 00:06:18.244
with Iraq when I'm focusing
on other things.

00:06:18.277 --> 00:06:21.981
Namely the moon.
Yes I said it the moon.

00:06:22.881 --> 00:06:25.117
Can't be distracted,
what's going on with the war?

00:06:25.150 --> 00:06:27.686
What's wrong with the economy?
Stop worrying about that.

00:06:27.719 --> 00:06:31.323
I got that shit under control.
Let's focus on space (bleep).

00:06:31.356 --> 00:06:33.592
The United States of space,

00:06:33.625 --> 00:06:35.128
'cause I ain't stopping
at the moon.

00:06:35.828 --> 00:06:37.329
Write this down.

00:06:37.362 --> 00:06:42.668
M-A-R-S. Mars bitches.
That's where we are going.

00:06:42.701 --> 00:06:44.837
Mars. Red rocks
Yay yay!

00:06:52.177 --> 00:06:54.713
You know something? We're not
just gonna go

00:06:54.746 --> 00:07:00.486
to New Hampshire, Tom Harkin.
We are gonna go to New York.

00:07:01.220 --> 00:07:04.790
We're gonna go to Vermont.
We're gonna go to Oregon.

00:07:04.823 --> 00:07:07.193
We're gonna go to Pittsburgh
and Pennsylvania.

00:07:07.226 --> 00:07:09.528
We're going to Cancun
for spring break.

00:07:09.561 --> 00:07:12.364
We're gonna go to Montreal.
We're going to Vancouver.

00:07:12.397 --> 00:07:13.999
I'm going all over the world

00:07:14.032 --> 00:07:16.502
and then I'm coming all the way
to Washington D.C

00:07:16.535 --> 00:07:18.037
to take back
the White House.

00:07:19.338 --> 00:07:22.508
Byaaah.

00:07:27.312 --> 00:07:29.849 line:92%
Byaaah.

00:07:29.882 --> 00:07:31.183
I'm gonna kick open the door
in the oval office

00:07:31.216 --> 00:07:34.386
and I'm gonna chop that
motherfucking desk in half.

00:07:34.419 --> 00:07:36.889
"Byaaah."

00:07:36.922 --> 00:07:38.691
And then I'm gonna grab
the secret service like this

00:07:38.724 --> 00:07:42.461
and put 'em in a headlock
and say, "Byaaah."

00:07:42.494 --> 00:07:44.129
And then I'm gonna
go upstairs in my bedroom

00:07:44.162 --> 00:07:48.568
I'm gonna grab my wife
like this and be like, "Byaaah."

00:07:49.668 --> 00:07:51.637
And then I'm gonna wash up,
we'll wash up

00:07:51.670 --> 00:07:54.841
and I'm gonna be
like this, "Byaaah."

00:07:55.841 --> 00:07:57.477
Good night.

00:08:01.647 --> 00:08:03.983 line:0%
He set the policy
for this administration

00:08:04.016 --> 00:08:05.584 line:0%
and I support the President.

00:08:05.617 --> 00:08:06.986 line:0%
90 seconds.

00:08:07.019 --> 00:08:09.321 line:0%
Well I think it's important
to remember

00:08:09.354 --> 00:08:11.090 line:0%
when you're talking
about this issue

00:08:11.123 --> 00:08:14.226 line:0%
that Vice President Cheney
has a lesbian daughter

00:08:14.259 --> 00:08:16.262
and not only is
his daughter a lesbian,

00:08:17.162 --> 00:08:19.064
but his mom's a lesbian.

00:08:19.097 --> 00:08:21.634
And his sister's a lesbian,
and his great granny

00:08:21.667 --> 00:08:24.437
has holes in her panties.
"Byaaah."

00:08:25.370 --> 00:08:26.338
Well Gwen let me simply thank-

00:08:26.371 --> 00:08:28.274
"Byaaah."

00:08:28.307 --> 00:08:32.444
for the kind words he said about
my family and our daughter.

00:08:32.477 --> 00:08:38.684
"Byaaah, Byaaah." "Byaaah."
I love lesbians.

00:08:38.717 --> 00:08:42.488
"Byaaah."
I watch the L Word on Showtime.

00:08:42.521 --> 00:08:44.156
"Byaaah.

00:08:46.291 --> 00:08:49.228
Byaaah."

00:08:53.098 --> 00:08:55.701
I got a tax policy
that'll break your neck.

00:08:55.734 --> 00:08:58.971
Byaaah.
Got you all a check.

00:08:59.004 --> 00:09:01.340
Going to Washington
down to Vermont,

00:09:01.373 --> 00:09:04.910
down to, "Byaaah."
"Byaaah. Byaaah."

00:09:04.943 --> 00:09:06.546
Byaaah.
