00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.700
There's nothing quite so terrible as needing something that's sitting right in front of you but not being able to get it.

00:00:04.710 --> 00:00:08.349
Like say you're on a lifeboat in the ocean
and you're super thirsty,

00:00:08.349 --> 00:00:13.360
and there's 300,000,000 cubic miles of water sitting right in front of you, but you can't drink any of it.

00:00:13.360 --> 00:00:16.960
Or having to sit next to Megan Kale every
day in math class,

00:00:16.970 --> 00:00:19.660
but knowing she's really dramatically out
of your league.

00:00:19.660 --> 00:00:23.970
A lot of organisms on earth find themselves
in this situation, pretty much constantly,

00:00:23.970 --> 00:00:28.080
except that the thing that's everywhere that
they can't have isn't water or physical closeness;

00:00:28.080 --> 00:00:30.500
it's nutrients,
specifically, nitrogen and phosphorus.

00:00:30.500 --> 00:00:33.210
Of course, there are tons of elements that
cycle around the earth

00:00:33.210 --> 00:00:37.370
hanging out in one place or form for a while
before moving on to the next,

00:00:37.370 --> 00:00:40.050
and as you know, living things need a bunch
of stuff.

00:00:40.050 --> 00:00:42.880
Animals, for instance, need oxygen and carbon
and hydrogen.

00:00:42.880 --> 00:00:46.860
These elements basically cover the water cycle and the carbon cycle that I talked about last time,

00:00:46.860 --> 00:00:50.880
but we're also about 3% nitrogen and 1% phosphorus.

00:00:50.890 --> 00:00:52.989
Those numbers might not sound super significant,

00:00:52.989 --> 00:00:55.530
but even though we've just got teensy bits
of the stuff in our bodies,

00:00:55.530 --> 00:00:58.760
we need nitrogen to make like, amino acids,
which make proteins,

00:00:58.760 --> 00:01:01.390
which make our whole bodies up, and DNA and
RNA, too.

00:01:01.390 --> 00:01:06.610
DNA and RNA also require phosphorus, not to
mention that phosphorus is the P in ATP,

00:01:06.610 --> 00:01:08.850
and the Phosphorus in phospholipid bi-layer.

00:01:08.850 --> 00:01:12.910
So we might not need a ton of the stuff, but
it is important, and it's hanging out everywhere;

00:01:12.910 --> 00:01:18.310
the air we breathe is mostly nitrogen, and the water and rocks all around us are jam-packed full of phosphorus.

00:01:18.310 --> 00:01:21.650
But like I said, they're rarely in a form
that's biologically available.

00:01:21.650 --> 00:01:25.750
And as per usual, the organisms that solve
this problem are the plants.

00:01:25.750 --> 00:01:29.060
Anything else that needs these nutrients are
just gonna have to eat some plants

00:01:29.060 --> 00:01:30.600
or eat something that ate some plants.

00:01:30.600 --> 00:01:34.600
But how do plants solve this problem? And
why is it a problem in the first place?

00:01:34.600 --> 00:01:36.880
Well, give me a few minutes, I'll explain.

00:01:36.880 --> 00:01:46.400
[Theme Music]

00:01:46.400 --> 00:01:51.479
So let's talk about the nitrogen cycle first,
since nitrogen really is actually all around us,

00:01:51.479 --> 00:01:54.200
like I can feel it right now, there it is
in the air.

00:01:54.200 --> 00:01:57.970
So why is it so hard to get this stuff that's
constantly surrounding us in the air

00:01:57.970 --> 00:02:00.790
into our actual bodies to be useful for us?

00:02:00.790 --> 00:02:03.799
Because even though nitrogen gas makes up
about 78% of the atmosphere,

00:02:03.800 --> 00:02:08.880
you'll notice here that nitrogen gas is made up of two nitrogen atoms stuck together with a triple bond.

00:02:08.880 --> 00:02:11.920
And it's one thing to break apart a single
covalent bond, but three?

00:02:11.920 --> 00:02:16.120
So as you can imagine, those two nitrogen
atoms are a total pain to pry apart.

00:02:16.120 --> 00:02:19.840
But that molecule has to be split in order
for a plant to get at the pieces.

00:02:19.849 --> 00:02:25.189
In fact, plants can assimilate a bunch of different forms of nitrogen, nitrates, nitrites to a lesser extent,

00:02:25.190 --> 00:02:28.230
and even ammonium, which is what you get when
you mix ammonia with water.

00:02:28.230 --> 00:02:32.510
But all that darn nitrogen gas in the atmosphere
is beyond their powers of assimilation.

00:02:32.510 --> 00:02:36.620
So plants need help taking advantage of this
ocean of nitrogen that we're all swimming in,

00:02:36.620 --> 00:02:40.820
which is why they need to have that nitrogen
fixed, so that they can use it.

00:02:40.820 --> 00:02:44.480
Even though plants aren't wily enough to wrangle
those two nitrogen atoms apart,

00:02:44.480 --> 00:02:47.060
certain nitrogen fixing bacteria are.

00:02:47.069 --> 00:02:51.420
These bacteria hang out in soil or water or
even form symbiotic relationships with the

00:02:51.420 --> 00:02:54.880
root nodules of some plants,
most of which are legumes.

00:02:54.880 --> 00:02:59.680
That's a pretty big family of plants:
soybeans, clover, peanuts, kudzu, all legumes.

00:02:59.680 --> 00:03:03.410
So these bacteria just sit around converting
atmospheric nitrogen into ammonia,

00:03:03.410 --> 00:03:07.330
which then becomes ammonium when it's mixed
with water, which can be used by plants.

00:03:07.330 --> 00:03:09.800
They do this with a special enzyme called
nitrogenase,

00:03:09.800 --> 00:03:14.000
which is the only biological enzyme that can
break that crazy triple bond.

00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:17.800
Ammonia can also be made by decomposers, fungi,
protists,

00:03:17.800 --> 00:03:21.250
other kinds of bacteria that munch on your
proteins and DNA after you die,

00:03:21.250 --> 00:03:24.209
but they're not picky, they like poop and
urine, too.

00:03:24.209 --> 00:03:28.940
Then once this has happened, other bacteria known as nitrifying bacteria can take this ammonia

00:03:28.940 --> 00:03:34.239
and convert it into nitrates, three oxygen atoms attached to a single nitrogen atom, and nitrites,

00:03:34.239 --> 00:03:35.830
two oxygen atoms attached to a nitrogen,

00:03:35.830 --> 00:03:38.930
and those are even easier than ammonium for
plants to assimilate.

00:03:38.930 --> 00:03:41.970
So the take home here is that if it wasn't
for these bacteria,

00:03:41.970 --> 00:03:45.769
there'd be a whole lot less of biologically
available nitrogen hanging around,

00:03:45.769 --> 00:03:49.200
and as a result, there'd be a lot fewer living
things on the planet.

00:03:49.200 --> 00:03:52.519
So as usual, thanks bacteria -- we owe you
one!

00:03:52.519 --> 00:03:56.489
But I should mention that it's not just bacteria
who can wrangle those two nitrogen atoms apart.

00:03:56.489 --> 00:04:00.120
Lightning, of all things, has enough energy
to break the bonds between nitrogens,

00:04:00.120 --> 00:04:04.400
which is obviously awesome, and therefore
worth mentioning, and in the 20th century,

00:04:04.400 --> 00:04:08.980
smartypants humans also figured out various ways to synthetically fix a ton of nitrogen all at once,

00:04:08.980 --> 00:04:13.360
which is why we have synthetic fertilizers now and so much food growing all over the place.

00:04:13.360 --> 00:04:18.760
Once the atmospheric nitrogen is converted into a form that plants can use to make DNA and RNA and amino acids,

00:04:18.760 --> 00:04:24.240
organic nitrogen takes off up the food chain
and animals eat the plants and use all that sweet,

00:04:24.240 --> 00:04:27.439
sweet bio-available nitrogen to make our own
amino acids,

00:04:27.439 --> 00:04:31.879
and then we pee or poop it out or die and
the decomposers go to town on it,

00:04:31.880 --> 00:04:35.419
breaking it down to ammonia and it all keeps
going...until!

00:04:35.419 --> 00:04:39.849
One day, that organic nitrogen finds itself
in denitrifying bacteria,

00:04:39.849 --> 00:04:42.259
whose job it is to metabolize the nitrogen
oxides,

00:04:42.259 --> 00:04:47.349
turn them back into nitrogen gas using a special
enzyme called nitrate reductase.

00:04:47.349 --> 00:04:51.419
These guys do their business and then release
the N2 back into the atmosphere.

00:04:51.419 --> 00:04:53.879
And that, my friends, is the nitrogen cycle.

00:04:53.879 --> 00:04:55.979
If you remember nothing else, remember that:

00:04:55.979 --> 00:05:00.309
a) you owe bacteria a solid because they were
smart enough to make an enzyme that can bust

00:05:00.309 --> 00:05:02.330
open the triple bonds of nitrogen gas,

00:05:02.330 --> 00:05:07.159
b) you owe plants a solid for wrestling nitrogen
into their bodies so that you can just eat

00:05:07.159 --> 00:05:09.270
a carrot and not have to think about it,

00:05:09.270 --> 00:05:15.660
and c) nitrogen is awesome and everywhere and yet, also elusive and deserving of your respect.

00:05:15.660 --> 00:05:18.900
So, moving on, to the phosphorus cycle.

00:05:18.900 --> 00:05:21.999
The interesting thing about phosphorus is
that it's the only element that we're going

00:05:21.999 --> 00:05:25.139
to talk about that doesn't involve the atmosphere.

00:05:25.140 --> 00:05:27.699
Phosphorus wants nothing to do with your air.

00:05:27.699 --> 00:05:32.759
However, the lithosphere, fancy word for the
earth's crust, is amply supplied with phosphorus.

00:05:32.760 --> 00:05:37.939
Rocks contain inorganic phosphates, especially sedimentary rocks that originated in old ocean floors

00:05:37.939 --> 00:05:40.710
and lake beds where living things died and
sank to the bottom

00:05:40.710 --> 00:05:45.250
where their phosphorus rich bodies piled up
and made phosphorus rich rocks over time.

00:05:45.250 --> 00:05:49.419
Unfortunately, there aren't a lot of rock-eating
organisms on earth, just a couple bacteria,

00:05:49.419 --> 00:05:51.779
which are called lithotrophs, by the way.

00:05:51.779 --> 00:05:54.919
However, when these rocks are re-exposed and
water erodes them,

00:05:54.919 --> 00:05:57.009
some of the phosphates are dissolved into
the water.

00:05:57.009 --> 00:06:01.460
These dissolved phosphates are immediately
available to and assimilated by plants,

00:06:01.460 --> 00:06:03.660
which are then eaten by animals.

00:06:03.660 --> 00:06:07.600
From here, the same thing goes for the decomposers
as with the nitrogen cycle,

00:06:07.610 --> 00:06:10.159
when a leaf drops or something poops or dies,

00:06:10.159 --> 00:06:14.069
the decomposers break it down and release
the phosphates back into the soil or water.

00:06:14.069 --> 00:06:18.809
And phosphates get about as much downtime
in the soil as a $20 bill on the sidewalk.

00:06:18.809 --> 00:06:23.119
Decomposed phosphate is immediately reassimilated
back into plants and this little cycle just

00:06:23.119 --> 00:06:24.460
keeps going and going.

00:06:24.460 --> 00:06:27.939
Plants to the animal to the decomposers to
the soil and back into a plant

00:06:27.939 --> 00:06:32.629
— that is, until that atom of phosphorus
makes its way into some kind of body of water.

00:06:32.629 --> 00:06:36.289
Because aquatic and marine ecosystems need
phosphorus like crazy.

00:06:36.289 --> 00:06:40.869
Once a phosphorus atom makes its way into a deep lake or ocean, it cycles around among the organisms there —

00:06:40.869 --> 00:06:44.889
algae, plankton, fish, and this cycling can
go on for a long time.

00:06:44.889 --> 00:06:48.809
I mean, not as long as a phosphorus atom trapped
in a rock, that can be millions of years,

00:06:48.809 --> 00:06:53.569
but by some estimates, a single phosphorus
atom can be caught in a biological cycle for

00:06:53.569 --> 00:06:55.369
a 100,000 years.

00:06:55.369 --> 00:07:00.700
Eventually, it's in something that dies and falls into a hole so deep that decomposers can't survive there.

00:07:00.700 --> 00:07:05.780
Then sedimentation builds up and turns into
rock, which are eventually uplifted into mountains

00:07:05.789 --> 00:07:09.629
and exposed and the phosphates are weathered
back out and it's a cycle!

00:07:09.629 --> 00:07:12.809
So yeah, that's the deal with nitrogen and
phosphorus, living things need them,

00:07:12.809 --> 00:07:14.840
but even though they're all over the place,

00:07:14.840 --> 00:07:18.180
they're at a premium in biological systems because they're hard to get at,

00:07:18.180 --> 00:07:21.720
either because they have to be converted
into a form that organisms can use,

00:07:21.720 --> 00:07:23.379
or they're locked away underground.

00:07:23.379 --> 00:07:25.699
But you know who the smartest monkeys are?
Us.

00:07:25.700 --> 00:07:29.440
And yeah, you can bet your face that we've
figured out how to unleash all kinds of

00:07:29.449 --> 00:07:32.269
nitrogen and phosphorus into this big green
planet.

00:07:32.269 --> 00:07:35.700
Mostly, in an effort to help feed our children
and each other.

00:07:35.709 --> 00:07:38.789
We usually mean well, but we can be a bit
overbearing sometimes.

00:07:38.789 --> 00:07:43.089
It's just the human way, to see something
in nature that seems to be lacking or imperfect

00:07:43.089 --> 00:07:44.760
and try to make it the best thing ever.

00:07:44.760 --> 00:07:49.820
So with the phosphorus and nitrogen cycles, we have introduced fertilizers, lots and lots of fertilizers,

00:07:49.830 --> 00:07:53.879
the main ingredients of which are, you guessed
it, nitrogen and phosphorus.

00:07:53.880 --> 00:07:57.439
The story of how we learned to synthesize
nitrogen into ammonia for fertilizers

00:07:57.439 --> 00:08:01.729
and chemical weapons is a very, very interesting
one involving an evil lunatic,

00:08:01.729 --> 00:08:05.360
and I suggest as soon as this is over, you
watch this video on Fritz Haber,

00:08:05.360 --> 00:08:07.980
the guy who made all this happen during World
War I.

00:08:07.980 --> 00:08:09.960
You've heard of too much of a good thing,
right?

00:08:09.969 --> 00:08:11.739
Well, through the miracle of synthetic fertilizers,

00:08:11.739 --> 00:08:16.129
we're able to grow much, much more food than
we ever have before, and as a result,

00:08:16.129 --> 00:08:21.240
ecosystems all over the world are being bombarded by these incredible amounts of nitrogen and phosphorus.

00:08:21.240 --> 00:08:27.640
This takes us into the next chapter in our exploration of ecology, the human impacts on the biosphere.

00:08:27.649 --> 00:08:30.069
Sometimes, out of our desire to make nature
better,

00:08:30.069 --> 00:08:34.779
sometimes out of stupid human selfishness,
and most often both,

00:08:34.779 --> 00:08:39.129
we've ended up really messing up the environment
in more ways than we can count.

00:08:39.129 --> 00:08:41.909
And that's what we're going to be talking
about next week — be sure to wear your gas

00:08:41.909 --> 00:08:43.219
mask and HazMat gloves,

00:08:43.219 --> 00:08:45.889
