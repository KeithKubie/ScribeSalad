00:09:53.583 --> 00:09:57.890

00:09:57.891 --> 00:10:04.150
We're so honored to have 
everyone here today. On 

00:10:04.151 --> 00:10:12.515
behalf of the library of 
Congress, Dr. -- becomes 

00:10:12.516 --> 00:10:14.949
everyone this morning. We're 
exciteed to have 

00:10:14.950 --> 00:10:21.317
everyone here today. Today's 
program is in -- keep 

00:10:21.318 --> 00:10:25.172
his memory alive by supporting 
programs like this 

00:10:25.173 --> 00:10:29.748
this morning. We would like to 
spotlight Marsha and 

00:10:29.749 --> 00:10:34.129
barny here this morning who 
would love them to stand 

00:10:34.130 --> 00:10:38.288
and be acknowledged by this 
amazing crowd. 

00:10:38.289 --> 00:10:40.289
          (APPLAUSE).

00:10:43.677 --> 00:10:48.081
Their generosity has allowed us 
to do 

00:10:48.082 --> 00:10:50.905
programs like this.
          By the way, this week 

00:10:50.906 --> 00:10:54.641
is children's book 
week. That either one thing we 

00:10:54.642 --> 00:10:57.731
can agree on, that 
books brighten a someday, it's 

00:10:57.732 --> 00:11:02.584
like the light of the 
room. When I was a kid all those

00:11:02.989 --> 00:11:07.109
 Dr. Seuss books 
were my favorite, when I became 

00:11:07.110 --> 00:11:11.393
a teenageer and it's 
going to show my age were the 

00:11:11.394 --> 00:11:16.389
hardy boys books, 
there's the John Greene books, I

00:11:16.390 --> 00:11:22.459
 can go on and on, 
but you're very lucky with the 

00:11:22.460 --> 00:11:24.639
selection of books 
you have nowadays.

00:11:24.640 --> 00:11:31.865
          We're lucky to have 
schools here from 

00:11:31.866 --> 00:11:36.873
district. When I call out your 
school you need to 

00:11:36.874 --> 00:11:43.141
have a major cheer.
          First is thorough good

00:11:43.968 --> 00:11:45.968
 Marshall school.

00:11:48.361 --> 00:11:50.927
There was a slight pause there, 
I thought 

00:11:50.928 --> 00:11:52.928
they weren't here.

00:11:55.642 --> 00:11:59.331
All right all right.
          The school

00:12:03.488 --> 00:12:05.488
 -- 

00:12:12.426 --> 00:12:18.098
I think they did something here.
          I know we're going to 

00:12:18.099 --> 00:12:20.099
one up each other.

00:12:38.611 --> 00:12:41.143
All right the seed school.

00:12:46.250 --> 00:12:49.934
And the last one the Washington 
global P T 

00:12:49.935 --> 00:12:51.935
S.

00:12:56.046 --> 00:13:00.105
They also have all of you here 
today so 

00:13:00.106 --> 00:13:02.330
one big round of applause for 
all of you.

00:13:02.331 --> 00:13:10.013
                    (APPLAUSE).
          Now, you're not the 

00:13:10.014 --> 00:13:15.129
only teenagers 
watching by the way, today's 

00:13:15.130 --> 00:13:22.841
event is being streamed 
on library of Congress website 

00:13:22.842 --> 00:13:27.064
and You Tube channel. 
So everyone watching online, 

00:13:27.065 --> 00:13:30.505
hello.
          A lot of love from 

00:13:30.506 --> 00:13:32.068
Washington.
          And you know, we want 

00:13:32.069 --> 00:13:36.772
to say hi to all the 
kids watching coast to coast.

00:13:36.773 --> 00:13:39.293
          We got to simmer it 
down now.

00:13:39.294 --> 00:13:42.739
          All right now we're 
here today to talk 

00:13:42.740 --> 00:13:46.574
about a major moment in civil 
right's history.

00:13:46.575 --> 00:13:50.517
          Several months ago, 
about a year ago, the 

00:13:50.518 --> 00:13:55.062
moving loving came out and it 
was based on this very 

00:13:55.063 --> 00:13:58.355
important Supreme Court decision
. How many of you 

00:13:58.356 --> 00:14:02.767
heard of the loveings? The 
adults say yes, we're 

00:14:02.768 --> 00:14:06.755
hoping before this morning is 
over we will educate 

00:14:06.756 --> 00:14:10.035
the students here today.
          Believe it or not 

00:14:10.036 --> 00:14:13.174
there was a time in 
American history that white 

00:14:13.175 --> 00:14:17.109
Americans and African 
Americans could not get married.

00:14:17.110 --> 00:14:20.558
 It's very hard to 
wrap your head around but that 

00:14:20.559 --> 00:14:25.979
was a dark time in 
history and you could be thrown 

00:14:25.980 --> 00:14:29.210
in jail if you got 
married.

00:14:29.211 --> 00:14:33.911
          Mildred and Richard 
who was white lived in 

00:14:33.912 --> 00:14:39.015
not so far Virginia, when they 
were arrested and 

00:14:39.016 --> 00:14:42.859
sentenceed to a year in prison 
just because they were 

00:14:42.860 --> 00:14:45.437
married. Really hard to imagine 
that now.

00:14:45.438 --> 00:14:48.112
          There their case went 
all the way to the 

00:14:48.113 --> 00:14:54.239
Supreme Court, and 50 years ago 
this year they won. 

00:14:54.240 --> 00:15:00.208
Their case changed laws across 
the country so it -- 

00:15:00.209 --> 00:15:05.392
no one can decide who to marry.
          We have the author 

00:15:05.393 --> 00:15:09.451
here today and the book 
I will administrators who has 

00:15:09.452 --> 00:15:14.743
joined us here on 
stage. We're also joined by an 

00:15:14.744 --> 00:15:17.924
expert lawyer and 
educator, I have Beth Hayes 

00:15:17.925 --> 00:15:23.564
Patterson, she's been 
teaching laws for almost 40 

00:15:23.565 --> 00:15:28.427
years and her speciality 
is race and the law.

00:15:28.428 --> 00:15:33.544
          I'm lucky to introduce
 her, she's been a 

00:15:33.545 --> 00:15:42.168
friend of almost a decade -- she
 has been a mentor, 

00:15:42.169 --> 00:15:46.879
teacher and just, you know, I 
used to work at the 

00:15:46.880 --> 00:15:50.721
Pratt library with Deb and we 
come a long way from 

00:15:50.722 --> 00:15:57.099
the today show to this morning.
          So please Deb Taylor 

00:15:57.100 --> 00:15:58.654
will be leading today
today's discussion. Thank you 

00:15:58.655 --> 00:16:03.821
for joining us and 
I'll pass it onto Deb. 

00:16:03.822 --> 00:16:07.051
          (APPLAUSE).
          Good morning, and it's

00:16:07.052 --> 00:16:11.844
 good to be with you 
to Gus this uncredible book that

00:16:13.883 --> 00:16:17.016
 the subject and the 
people who liveed with this 

00:16:17.017 --> 00:16:22.459
history with eloquence 
and care, because this story is 

00:16:22.460 --> 00:16:24.317
so important to who 
we are as a nation we're going 

00:16:24.318 --> 00:16:29.516
to place in social 
and historical context, as he 

00:16:29.517 --> 00:16:34.517
told you I'm joined by 
an esteem panel, they'll each 

00:16:34.518 --> 00:16:37.663
give us brief thought 
busy the work and the time 

00:16:37.664 --> 00:16:41.754
that's it depicts.
          We're going to begin 

00:16:41.755 --> 00:16:44.892
with a brief video 
about the landmark decision that

00:16:45.443 --> 00:16:47.175
 we commemorate 
today.

00:16:47.176 --> 00:16:52.133
                    (VIDEO) 
          I think marrying who 

00:16:52.134 --> 00:16:57.315
you want to is all 
right it's a God given right, I 

00:16:57.316 --> 00:17:01.378
think.
          Mildred loving married

00:17:02.864 --> 00:17:07.677
 the boy next door 
-- they were born and raised in 

00:17:07.678 --> 00:17:09.784
Caroline county 
Virginia, where they seemed un

00:17:09.785 --> 00:17:13.474
aware of the prejudice 
that existed across the country.

00:17:13.475 --> 00:17:17.881
 But they didn't 
know it was a crime to marry a 

00:17:17.882 --> 00:17:20.934
knee grow in Virginia
Virginia, they found out the 

00:17:20.935 --> 00:17:24.003
hard way.
          I didn't realize how 

00:17:24.004 --> 00:17:26.578
bad it was until they 
got married.

00:17:26.579 --> 00:17:31.520
          Their homes with 
children, their own three 

00:17:31.521 --> 00:17:37.644
as long as neighborhood friends,
 she recalls the one 

00:17:37.645 --> 00:17:42.931
night in 1958.
          The night we were 

00:17:42.932 --> 00:17:49.031
arrested, I guess it was 
about 2 a.m., and I saw this 

00:17:49.032 --> 00:17:52.899
light you know and I 
woke up and is it was the police

00:17:53.576 --> 00:17:58.701
man, and they said 
told to us get up and we were 

00:17:58.702 --> 00:18:02.709
under arrest.
          You go ahead and play.

00:18:02.710 --> 00:18:10.840
                    Anyway, they
 and locked us up. And January 

00:18:10.841 --> 00:18:14.614
they had the trial. And they 
told to us leave the 

00:18:14.615 --> 00:18:19.646
state for 25 years. They said we
 can come back to 

00:18:19.647 --> 00:18:26.704
visit when we wanted to. So that
 Easter we came back 

00:18:26.705 --> 00:18:30.689
and they got us again.
          They found out we were

00:18:31.001 --> 00:18:36.097
 there and they 
arrested us again.

00:18:36.098 --> 00:18:41.531
          They spent five years 
where they suffered 

00:18:41.532 --> 00:18:45.382
-- was hit by a car --

00:18:49.065 --> 00:18:53.767
 the Robert Kennedy who in 
turn passed the letter on a 

00:18:53.768 --> 00:18:57.457
member of the simple 
libertyies 89.

00:18:57.458 --> 00:19:00.847
          We have children and 
cannot afford an 

00:19:00.848 --> 00:19:03.821
attorney, we wrote to the 
Attorney General and 

00:19:03.822 --> 00:19:07.008
suggested we get in touch with 
you for advice, 

00:19:07.009 --> 00:19:11.587
please get with us when you can.
 Hope to hear from 

00:19:11.588 --> 00:19:14.502
you real soon. It was a simple 
letter that got us 

00:19:14.503 --> 00:19:19.206
into this not so simple case.
          They did help the love

00:19:19.749 --> 00:19:25.357
ings. Came up with 
another attorney and with no fee

00:19:25.362 --> 00:19:29.874
 they opened the 
plea, until the Supreme Court 

00:19:29.875 --> 00:19:34.442
heard these arguments.
          We advance the 

00:19:34.443 --> 00:19:41.814
arguments that statues are 
slavey statutes, -- the 

00:19:41.815 --> 00:19:47.065
outrageous of these statutes 
are not always apparent right 

00:19:47.066 --> 00:19:49.891
away.
          For example, if 

00:19:49.892 --> 00:19:55.464
Richard loving were to die 
then Mildred would not be able 

00:19:55.465 --> 00:19:59.458
to collect benefits 
as his which do. We asked the 

00:19:59.459 --> 00:20:04.408
court to decide that 
the state may not pass a law 

00:20:04.409 --> 00:20:07.394
that describes marriage 
base on race alone.

00:20:07.395 --> 00:20:11.935
          The attorneys for the 
state of Virginia re

00:20:11.936 --> 00:20:15.643
refuseed to talk with A BC.
          They seemed to say 

00:20:15.644 --> 00:20:19.487
there was a present day 
justification for these laws, 

00:20:19.488 --> 00:20:23.657
that is they're 
interested in the welfare, the 

00:20:23.658 --> 00:20:25.759
children of such 
marriages.

00:20:25.760 --> 00:20:29.303
          Today the United 
States Supreme Court 

00:20:29.304 --> 00:20:32.445
handed down the decisions. 
Richard and

00:20:36.444 --> 00:20:40.127
 Mildred have 
the right -- it's included

00:20:44.991 --> 00:20:49.940
 --
          This A BC news report

00:20:50.083 --> 00:20:52.921
ing.
                    (APPLAUSE)

00:20:56.755 --> 00:20:59.108
.
          Before we begin we 

00:20:59.109 --> 00:21:02.024
would like to remind 
the adults in our audience that 

00:21:02.025 --> 00:21:04.141

the students and the participant

00:21:07.835 --> 00:21:13.254
s on the stage. If 
time allows and there's no 

00:21:13.255 --> 00:21:17.507

microphones we'll take questions

00:21:17.812 --> 00:21:20.481

00:23:39.746 --> 00:23:42.043

00:23:51.566 --> 00:23:58.483

          Thank you, good 

00:23:58.484 --> 00:24:01.222
morning everyone.
          Well, first I have to 

00:24:01.223 --> 00:24:05.627
give a shut out to 
two schools, I have to recognize

00:24:05.769 --> 00:24:09.864
 those from the 
thorough good Marshall. It was 

00:24:09.865 --> 00:24:17.301
started by two 
Georgetown graduates and a 

00:24:17.302 --> 00:24:21.998
special welcome from seed 
public travel school.

00:24:21.999 --> 00:24:25.941
          So I want to pick up 
on something you 

00:24:25.942 --> 00:24:29.074
heard in the tape, and that is 
one of the lawyers 

00:24:29.075 --> 00:24:32.214
referred to the fact that what 
they wanted to do was 

00:24:32.215 --> 00:24:37.176
to address the law, that was a 
message of slavery.

00:24:37.177 --> 00:24:39.902
          Let's begin the legal 
discussion by going 

00:24:39.903 --> 00:24:42.893
back to the post Civil War 
period.

00:24:42.894 --> 00:24:47.847
          There were three 
important amendments that 

00:24:47.848 --> 00:24:51.129
were adopted at that time, and 
the goal was to 

00:24:51.130 --> 00:24:55.378
fundamentally change the status 
of the formal slaves

00:24:55.379 --> 00:25:03.612
slaves. So the 13th amendment 
abolished savvy, the 

00:25:03.613 --> 00:25:09.347
is is 15th amendment gave the 
right to vote, 

00:25:09.348 --> 00:25:14.297
denied the ability to vote on 
the base of race. That 

00:25:14.298 --> 00:25:18.602
only affected African American 
men, African American 

00:25:18.603 --> 00:25:23.414
had to wait another 50 years to 
get a right to vote.

00:25:23.415 --> 00:25:27.095
          14th amendment which 
was most involved 

00:25:27.096 --> 00:25:32.038
in this case is the a.m. L 
amendment that guaranteed 

00:25:32.039 --> 00:25:36.204
two things that an individual in
 this state could 

00:25:36.205 --> 00:25:40.894
not be deprived of life, libbity
 without due process 

00:25:40.895 --> 00:25:44.819
of law and the second is to 
guarantee theial 

00:25:44.820 --> 00:25:47.584
protection of laws in the state.
          So what did equal 

00:25:47.585 --> 00:25:53.443
protection of the laws 
mean for the formal slaves? The 

00:25:53.444 --> 00:25:57.932
Supreme Court 
answered that in 1896 in a 

00:25:57.933 --> 00:25:59.933
indication titleth

00:26:00.965 --> 00:26:02.968
 -- 
came out of the state of 

00:26:02.969 --> 00:26:07.081
Louisiana, it had a law 
that said that black people and 

00:26:07.082 --> 00:26:13.300
white people have to 
be separateed in railroad cars, 

00:26:13.301 --> 00:26:16.756
they cannot sit each 
other. They challengeed that law

00:26:17.609 --> 00:26:22.412
 and he assumeed with 
the package of the 14th 

00:26:22.413 --> 00:26:24.689
amendment and woman 
treatment under the law that 

00:26:24.690 --> 00:26:27.831
that law would be 
instruct down but it doesn't 

00:26:27.832 --> 00:26:30.414
happen.
          The Supreme Court 

00:26:30.415 --> 00:26:34.066
determined that the 
states could separate people by 

00:26:34.067 --> 00:26:35.971
race as long as 
things were equal.

00:26:35.972 --> 00:26:42.342
          So, this doctrine of 
separate but equal, 

00:26:42.343 --> 00:26:46.887
was a doctrine that lasted for a
 long time. And 

00:26:46.888 --> 00:26:51.455
allowed states to pass laws 
which they did, that are 

00:26:51.456 --> 00:26:57.117
required or allowed the 
separation of people by race 

00:26:57.118 --> 00:27:02.267
in movie theaters, in restaurant
s, in libraryies, in 

00:27:02.268 --> 00:27:04.586
restrooms.
          During that period of 

00:27:04.587 --> 00:27:09.436
time also was when 
Virginia passed the racial 

00:27:09.437 --> 00:27:12.327
integrity act, if you 
look at the slide, it's in the 

00:27:12.328 --> 00:27:14.916
bottom middle, the 
Virginia

00:27:18.778 --> 00:27:22.287
 bulletin explain this act and 
it says that 

00:27:22.288 --> 00:27:26.300
white and non-white people 
cannot marry and if they 

00:27:26.301 --> 00:27:28.974
do it's a crime.
          So this is what we had

00:27:28.975 --> 00:27:34.571
 as law, separate 
but equal. Laws like the state 

00:27:34.572 --> 00:27:36.996
ouvriers that 
prohibited marriage between 

00:27:36.997 --> 00:27:43.481
people of different race
races, until 1954, and in 19 a 4

00:27:43.482 --> 00:27:47.873
, the Supreme Court 
decide the case of brown versus 

00:27:47.874 --> 00:27:51.178
Board of Education, 
I'm sure you all heard about it,

00:27:51.473 --> 00:27:55.562
 that was where they 
looked at this whole separate 

00:27:55.563 --> 00:27:59.728
but equal doctrine. 
And same slide, to the left, 

00:27:59.729 --> 00:28:04.266
bottom left, brown 
versus board of education, when 

00:28:04.267 --> 00:28:10.378
the court says when 
it comes to education, separate 

00:28:10.379 --> 00:28:13.377
is inherently un
unequal, meaning there's no way 

00:28:13.378 --> 00:28:17.803
there's equalityity 
when the state says black 

00:28:17.804 --> 00:28:20.443
children have to go to 
school here, white people have 

00:28:20.444 --> 00:28:23.581
to go to school there
there. Totally unacceptable.

00:28:23.582 --> 00:28:28.137
          That ushered in what 
we called the period 

00:28:28.138 --> 00:28:33.389
of a new civil rights movement, 
if you will, and two 

00:28:33.390 --> 00:28:37.945
important events happened the 
next year in 195 2, in 

00:28:37.946 --> 00:28:45.828
August of 1955, 14 year old 
Emmett Till was in 

00:28:45.829 --> 00:28:49.067
Mississippi and was murdered and
 murdered why? 

00:28:49.068 --> 00:28:55.737
Because of aalleged he insulted 
a white woman, how, 

00:28:55.738 --> 00:28:59.439
he either whistleed or he said 
something to her, 

00:28:59.440 --> 00:29:04.845
that's it. And then in December 
of 1955, I know you 

00:29:04.846 --> 00:29:10.999
remember Rosa parks refused to 
give up her seat on a 

00:29:11.000 --> 00:29:14.364
bus in Alabama Alabama and a 
boycott started.

00:29:14.365 --> 00:29:20.787
          So that is -- after 
that in 1935 a -- 1955

00:29:20.788 --> 00:29:26.349
1955, the state of Virginia 
announceed it would 

00:29:26.350 --> 00:29:30.281
massive resistant in Board of 
Education -- on the 

00:29:30.282 --> 00:29:34.329
slide, lower right, you see a 
reference to Harry 

00:29:34.330 --> 00:29:38.831
bird who talked about that fact.
 Virginia resisted 

00:29:38.832 --> 00:29:43.081
so much that they close the the 
public schools 

00:29:43.082 --> 00:29:46.377
rather than integrate them. 
There was one county in 

00:29:46.378 --> 00:29:50.632
Virginia, prince Edward county 
about 90 miles from 

00:29:50.633 --> 00:29:54.454
here, where the schools stayed 
closed for five years

00:29:54.455 --> 00:30:01.032
years, from 1959 to 1964.
          So that is the 

00:30:01.033 --> 00:30:07.396
atmosphere within which 
Mildred Jeter and Richard loving

00:30:08.815 --> 00:30:09.694
 had their 
relationship begin.

00:30:09.695 --> 00:30:13.109
          So you can see we have
 a very dramatic 

00:30:13.110 --> 00:30:16.658
time, but we're talking about 
people who are living 

00:30:16.659 --> 00:30:20.909
their lives, and who are not 
necessarily caught up 

00:30:20.910 --> 00:30:22.925
in the drama as we saw on the 
slide.

00:30:22.926 --> 00:30:26.472
          So, now we come to the
 that story, and I 

00:30:26.473 --> 00:30:31.332
want to start by asking Patricia
, why? Why this 

00:30:31.333 --> 00:30:35.347
story? For this time when so 
many of our young 

00:30:35.348 --> 00:30:39.113
people don't know this history, 
or may not be able 

00:30:39.114 --> 00:30:43.114
to apply to heme, why did this 
story compel you to 

00:30:43.115 --> 00:30:48.668
write about it?
          It's a story of love, 

00:30:48.669 --> 00:30:53.475
the name of the 
couple, the loving, their name 

00:30:53.476 --> 00:30:56.456
was loving, and they 
were very much in love and I got

00:30:56.457 --> 00:31:01.286
 to tell a love 
story, and in among the civil 

00:31:01.287 --> 00:31:03.585
rights movement, all 
the slide you're seeing

00:31:06.680 --> 00:31:11.446
 on Ginger Elizabeth were 
pages of the book as these in 

00:31:11.447 --> 00:31:15.575
property of you, and I 
came from a very socially 

00:31:15.576 --> 00:31:20.533
conscious family and we 
saw by example that when when 

00:31:20.534 --> 00:31:24.066
somebody needed help, 
you helped. So it was a very 

00:31:24.067 --> 00:31:27.050
compelling story for 
this reason. Do you want me to 

00:31:27.051 --> 00:31:30.079
go into the research? 
          &gt;&gt; 

00:31:30.080 --> 00:31:34.332
          Sure.
          Okay, we have the 

00:31:34.333 --> 00:31:39.130
bulletin called the 
racial integrity act, was put 

00:31:39.131 --> 00:31:45.973
into place in Virginia 
until 167 when the U.S. Supreme 

00:31:45.974 --> 00:31:47.974
Court favored

00:31:51.181 --> 00:31:52.483
 of 
interracial marriage. What it 

00:31:52.484 --> 00:31:57.370
says about 2/3 down 
there are people in Virginia who

00:31:58.205 --> 00:32:00.480
 are posing for 
white but they're not really 

00:32:00.481 --> 00:32:06.280
white. If you are 1/16
1/16th Native American then you 

00:32:06.281 --> 00:32:08.426
can call yourself 
white if everything else in your

00:32:08.721 --> 00:32:13.838
 family is white. 
But if you're 1/16th African 

00:32:13.839 --> 00:32:16.815
American and 
everything else is white you are

00:32:16.974 --> 00:32:20.420
 not white, that 
means you got one with great 

00:32:20.421 --> 00:32:23.163
great grand parent who 
is African American then you are

00:32:23.396 --> 00:32:27.327
 not a white person. 
So what it's saying is there are

00:32:28.186 --> 00:32:33.049
 people in there pre
presending to be white who are 

00:32:33.050 --> 00:32:36.132
intermarrying and you 
may not do that and if we catch 

00:32:36.133 --> 00:32:37.050
you it's against the 
law.

00:32:37.051 --> 00:32:41.299
          So on the right we 
have the photograph of 

00:32:41.300 --> 00:32:44.116
the white classroom and the 
black classroom, and 

00:32:44.117 --> 00:32:49.696
this is under the separate but 
equal law that Ginger 

00:32:49.697 --> 00:32:56.245
was mentioning the -- does that 
look equal to you? 

00:32:56.246 --> 00:32:58.246
Toes two classrooms? 

00:33:01.218 --> 00:33:03.218
So,

00:33:04.469 --> 00:33:07.037
 can I have the slide change 
please?

00:33:07.038 --> 00:33:12.004
          I did my research in 
eastern -- in 

00:33:12.005 --> 00:33:16.745
Virginia, Caroline county where 
the family lived in 

00:33:16.746 --> 00:33:20.557
a very integrative neighborhood 
and segregated state 

00:33:20.558 --> 00:33:26.096
this. is Mildred educateor's old
er brother -- I talk

00:33:26.097 --> 00:33:29.341
talked to family members and 
friends of the family 

00:33:29.342 --> 00:33:33.490
and the place is very important 
here because my 

00:33:33.491 --> 00:33:39.313
story starts in 1952. The movie 
started when they 

00:33:39.314 --> 00:33:44.311
get married in 58 when Mildred 
is 11 years old and 

00:33:44.312 --> 00:33:50.153
Richard is about 16 or 17 years 
old, and they grew 

00:33:50.154 --> 00:33:52.403
up in this neighborhood together
 and I got stories 

00:33:52.404 --> 00:33:56.114
from family members of what 
happened in their lives.

00:33:56.115 --> 00:34:00.801
          Doing this research I 
used primary sources 

00:34:00.802 --> 00:34:03.794
and I thought it was interesting
 to see how messy 

00:34:03.795 --> 00:34:08.189
they are.
          On the very top one it

00:34:08.598 --> 00:34:15.563
 reads Richard 
educateor a white man and -- 

00:34:15.564 --> 00:34:21.279
Richard loving -- they 
don't dignify her to give her 

00:34:21.280 --> 00:34:24.518
name, she's white and 
she's black and her name is not 

00:34:24.519 --> 00:34:29.970
on it. But here is 
her arrest want and she was 

00:34:29.971 --> 00:34:35.502
arrested in bed in 1958 
after they were married, and 

00:34:35.503 --> 00:34:39.049
then another -- and 
then they were exiled. We know a

00:34:39.193 --> 00:34:41.927
 lot of the story 
said they were sentence to the a

00:34:42.014 --> 00:34:47.134
 year in jail or 25 
years exiled. They lived in the 

00:34:47.135 --> 00:34:48.145
slum in Washington 
D.C. much.

00:34:48.146 --> 00:34:53.251
          So that was 58 and in 
1963 they tried to 

00:34:53.252 --> 00:35:01.693
get the case, the A CLU lawyers 
Bernie Cohen and 

00:35:01.694 --> 00:35:06.962
Phil Hirschkopf back into the 
court by bringing to 

00:35:06.963 --> 00:35:09.802
Lee I don't know who was the 
judge for the case and 

00:35:09.803 --> 00:35:14.752
he wrote remember raceist 
statement, which was very 

00:35:14.753 --> 00:35:19.567
helpful to the A CLU lawyers 
because it was so race

00:35:19.568 --> 00:35:24.577
racist, and what he said was "
Almosty God,

00:35:28.389 --> 00:35:32.806
 all might
mighty God created the raceist 

00:35:32.807 --> 00:35:38.612
yellow, black, and red 
and placed them on different 

00:35:38.613 --> 00:35:42.459
continents, his 
arrangement there would be no 

00:35:42.460 --> 00:35:45.594
cause for such 
marriages. The fact that he 

00:35:45.595 --> 00:35:51.563
separated the raceist 
shows he did not intend for the 

00:35:51.564 --> 00:35:55.251
races to mix.
          Mildred thinks about 

00:35:55.252 --> 00:35:59.960
this and says this is 
a nation of red people, spilling

00:36:00.263 --> 00:36:04.357
 by white people and 
the I don't know if she really 

00:36:04.358 --> 00:36:09.626
said that, this is a 
documentary novel means it's an 

00:36:09.627 --> 00:36:13.464
information a.m. 
book but I told it in voices of 

00:36:13.465 --> 00:36:16.034
Richard and Mildred.
          You talked about some 

00:36:16.035 --> 00:36:18.012
of the document 
that's are part of the book and 

00:36:18.013 --> 00:36:20.599
I think that creates 
a particular context for 

00:36:20.600 --> 00:36:26.758
opportunities, and I have 
to ask you because it's unusual 

00:36:26.759 --> 00:36:29.842
to have a book 
that's written for teenagers 

00:36:29.843 --> 00:36:33.381
primaryily to have 
illustrations, what do you think

00:36:33.944 --> 00:36:37.641
 your illustrations 
brought to your book and story?

00:36:37.642 --> 00:36:42.971
          I teach at the College
 of art and a class 

00:36:42.972 --> 00:36:47.729
called visual journalism, where 
we draw on location 

00:36:47.730 --> 00:36:50.173
and I wanted to use these draw
ings and some real 

00:36:50.174 --> 00:36:53.183
context but they wouldn't be 
appropriate for picture 

00:36:53.184 --> 00:36:57.562
book for very young readers, my 
agent is like let's 

00:36:57.563 --> 00:37:01.831
just put it on the website and 
see what happens, 

00:37:01.832 --> 00:37:04.090
they charactered me about 
contributing to this book 

00:37:04.091 --> 00:37:08.795
so I got really lucky basically.
          But I think the 

00:37:08.796 --> 00:37:12.830
illustrations add more of 
the love story and you can see 

00:37:12.831 --> 00:37:16.177
behind us is one of 
my favorite illustrations of 

00:37:16.178 --> 00:37:20.022
Richard and Mildred 
spilling away to run through the

00:37:20.884 --> 00:37:22.438
 woods and spend 
time with each other.

00:37:22.439 --> 00:37:26.469
          When I talked to the 
art director and the 

00:37:26.470 --> 00:37:29.268
editor at chronicle, we really 
wanted to focus on 

00:37:29.269 --> 00:37:33.305
their lives as individual people
, as opposeed to the 

00:37:33.306 --> 00:37:37.659
law and other interference with 
their life. I think 

00:37:37.660 --> 00:37:41.348
the illustrationsadd that level 
of softness and 

00:37:41.349 --> 00:37:45.053
hopefully a bit of magic between
 the two of them and 

00:37:45.054 --> 00:37:48.628
showing their chemistry and 
their love for one 

00:37:48.629 --> 00:37:52.600
another, and illustrations are 
nice. They're 

00:37:52.601 --> 00:37:55.888
beautiful drawings in the middle
 of sort of intense 

00:37:55.889 --> 00:37:58.442
legal documents and then the 
story itself, so.

00:37:58.443 --> 00:38:03.253
          Elizabeth, I remember 
that news clip, I'm 

00:38:03.254 --> 00:38:05.831
old enough that that's not 
something new to me so 

00:38:05.832 --> 00:38:08.817
see the news clip when the 
decision came down, I 

00:38:08.818 --> 00:38:13.067
also remember that there were 
states as late as 2000 

00:38:13.068 --> 00:38:16.047
that were just removeing the law
s from the books. 

00:38:16.048 --> 00:38:19.034
What does that mean, if anything
? Why were they 

00:38:19.035 --> 00:38:22.966
holding onto those laws if it 
had been struck down 

00:38:22.967 --> 00:38:28.286
through the loving case?
          Well unfor can'tly, 

00:38:28.287 --> 00:38:34.121
laws are very slow to 
act of change. I can't say I 

00:38:34.122 --> 00:38:38.973
can't read into the 
minds of legislatures, and that 

00:38:38.974 --> 00:38:42.249
was in Alabama, and 
so I can't say that it was an 

00:38:42.250 --> 00:38:45.783
act of defiance, I 
suspected it was maybe a little 

00:38:45.784 --> 00:38:49.780
of that and a little 
of just not wanting to do it, 

00:38:49.781 --> 00:38:51.599
not thinking it was an 
important thing to do.

00:38:51.600 --> 00:38:56.343
          The important thing is
 despite the fact 

00:38:56.344 --> 00:38:59.048
that Alabama did not remove the 
law from the books 

00:38:59.049 --> 00:39:03.553
until 2000, the law was changed 
once the Supreme 

00:39:03.554 --> 00:39:06.583
Court made the decision, that 
was it, so.

00:39:06.584 --> 00:39:10.519
          One of the things that
 stood out for me 

00:39:10.520 --> 00:39:13.781
from reading the book was even 
though there were 

00:39:13.782 --> 00:39:17.524
social restrictions on Richard 
and Mildred, when 

00:39:17.525 --> 00:39:22.612
they were in Virginia, Virginia 
was home. And one of 

00:39:22.613 --> 00:39:25.891
the things that comes across 
both in the 

00:39:25.892 --> 00:39:30.139
illustrations and then the 
poetry is the fact that 

00:39:30.140 --> 00:39:33.736
that was, even with all of its 
problems it was home, 

00:39:33.737 --> 00:39:38.137
how were you able to get that 
across, this whole 

00:39:38.138 --> 00:39:43.090
idea of the distinction between 
being exiled, so to 

00:39:43.091 --> 00:39:47.939
speak, and then wanting so 
desperately wanting to 

00:39:47.940 --> 00:39:50.628
come home?
          May I talk?

00:39:50.629 --> 00:39:55.758
          Yes, please.
          It starts in 1952 and

00:39:56.214 --> 00:40:01.889
my dread is 11 years 
old and Richard is back ground 

00:40:01.890 --> 00:40:04.831
because he's friends 
with her big brothers and it 

00:40:04.832 --> 00:40:10.971
shows how they grow up 
together in this interracial, 

00:40:10.972 --> 00:40:16.113
idealic setting they 
had families, they were 

00:40:16.114 --> 00:40:21.237
self-sufficient farmers, so 
after hog parking lotteringing 

00:40:21.238 --> 00:40:26.051
and neighbors came to 
help there would be a big party 

00:40:26.052 --> 00:40:30.877
and Mildred's older 
brother and father played in the

00:40:30.893 --> 00:40:33.316
 strategic band and 
they were the enter Al at the 

00:40:33.317 --> 00:40:36.073
same time for the 
neighborhood, beautiful commune

00:40:36.077 --> 00:40:42.333
ity of whites, blacks blacks 
and Indians together who had a 

00:40:42.334 --> 00:40:45.545
wonderful life and to 
be exiled in Washington was so 

00:40:45.546 --> 00:40:50.505
very different, they 
lived in a very small apartment 

00:40:50.506 --> 00:40:53.328
and it was dirty and 
there were lights on all the 

00:40:53.329 --> 00:40:56.387
time, opposeed to the 
nature, the natural world around

00:40:56.486 --> 00:41:01.176
 them, it did not 
feel like Earth to Mildred to be

00:41:02.191 --> 00:41:06.289
 in Washington wash, 
she wanted the scene of her cold

00:41:06.293 --> 00:41:09.542
 and her family, a 
very close anytime family and 

00:41:09.543 --> 00:41:11.706
the neighbors were all 
friends.

00:41:11.707 --> 00:41:14.991
          &gt;&gt; Could you speak to 
the book design.

00:41:14.992 --> 00:41:19.078
          Sure -- I grew up in 
Georgia in Atlanta 

00:41:19.079 --> 00:41:23.083
and the civil rights movement 
was the topic of 

00:41:23.084 --> 00:41:26.219
conversation at the dinner table
 all the time with 

00:41:26.220 --> 00:41:29.766
my family, so making the 
illustrations I couldn't go 

00:41:29.767 --> 00:41:33.682
back in a time machine and draw 
them as they grew up

00:41:33.683 --> 00:41:38.201
up, things felt very familiar in
 my writing with my 

00:41:38.202 --> 00:41:42.577
own mother and siblings with the
 way we manage 

00:41:42.578 --> 00:41:46.456
communey, so it was helpful to 
grow up with that 

00:41:46.457 --> 00:41:48.668
experience torque be able to 
make it real in the 

00:41:48.669 --> 00:41:52.226
illustrations.
          The book design 

00:41:52.227 --> 00:41:55.341
chronicle makes really 
beautiful books, you'll see the 

00:41:55.342 --> 00:42:01.367
book, it's gorgeous.
          I really love this 

00:42:01.368 --> 00:42:04.515
orange cover, hard 
cover that we have, but I felt 

00:42:04.516 --> 00:42:06.580
like we worked 
closely together and sort of 

00:42:06.581 --> 00:42:09.571
talking about the mood 
that we wanted to portray in the

00:42:09.706 --> 00:42:12.847
 story, and I'll 
show you -- can we get the next 

00:42:12.848 --> 00:42:15.692
slide please?
          The next one.

00:42:15.693 --> 00:42:18.974
          The next one.
          The next one.

00:42:18.975 --> 00:42:22.809
          The next one.
          Okay, one more.

00:42:22.810 --> 00:42:27.363
          That one.
          So, the first thing 

00:42:27.364 --> 00:42:31.612
that we understood 
going in is we wanted the book 

00:42:31.613 --> 00:42:36.305
to be printed in two 
colors, during the day when 

00:42:36.306 --> 00:42:39.741
printing was more 
expensive and you could on print

00:42:39.742 --> 00:42:42.976
 with a limit number 
of colors, so here in these 

00:42:42.977 --> 00:42:46.819
slides some of the cover 
R conversations that I was 

00:42:46.820 --> 00:42:50.105
having with the designer, 
most of time I don't get to work

00:42:50.678 --> 00:42:55.243
 with the designer 
of the book, but because I have 

00:42:55.244 --> 00:42:57.489
design background we 
were able to have intelligent 

00:42:57.490 --> 00:43:02.204
conversations. I sent 
maybe for or five color choices,

00:43:02.365 --> 00:43:06.494
 I was in love with 
this green and rusty red color 

00:43:06.495 --> 00:43:08.776
combination but if 
felt a little too heavy and we 

00:43:08.777 --> 00:43:12.560
got to this purple 
and gold when they overlapped 

00:43:12.561 --> 00:43:15.705
made a nice rich 
background which made illustrate

00:43:17.117 --> 00:43:20.548
ing I will dread, so 
it worked out and it was great 

00:43:20.549 --> 00:43:24.735
fun to be able it 
work with chronicle. A big part 

00:43:24.736 --> 00:43:27.552
of visual journalism
journalism, back in the 50's

00:43:30.721 --> 00:43:35.990
 Lee owny wasbrought 
virtual illustration to the 

00:43:35.991 --> 00:43:38.459
forefront and hired them 
to do what they wanted to do, 

00:43:38.460 --> 00:43:43.118
there was a lot of 
trust that had to go into that 

00:43:43.119 --> 00:43:45.266
Rich and I felt 
chronicle gave me that when we 

00:43:45.267 --> 00:43:48.552
were working on this 
book together.

00:43:48.553 --> 00:43:51.397
          I think we have one 
more a little bit of 

00:43:51.398 --> 00:43:54.976
discussion here, and I would 
like to talk about the 

00:43:54.977 --> 00:43:58.013
14th amendment for a moment, 
since so much of the 

00:43:58.014 --> 00:44:00.487
indication imageed on that and 
you made register to 

00:44:00.488 --> 00:44:04.236
it in your opening remarks, and 
how were they able 

00:44:04.237 --> 00:44:08.625
to zero in on the 14th amendment
 and to make their 

00:44:08.626 --> 00:44:12.879
case when they had not been 
successful at all of the 

00:44:12.880 --> 00:44:18.121
lower courts? Was it because 
they were with a more 

00:44:18.122 --> 00:44:21.583
systemic court or were they able
 to craft a story or 

00:44:21.584 --> 00:44:25.885
craft a way of understanding the
 14th amendment 

00:44:25.886 --> 00:44:28.818
that won their case?
          I think the lawyers 

00:44:28.819 --> 00:44:32.502
assumeed they would not 
prevail in Virginia at any level

00:44:32.653 --> 00:44:36.191
 and based on the 
history of the state that was 

00:44:36.192 --> 00:44:42.335
accurate. We refer to 
the integrity act, but Virginia 

00:44:42.336 --> 00:44:45.596
and Maryland were 
the two colonies that passed law

00:44:45.600 --> 00:44:50.558
s prohibiting enter 
messenger, and this is a very 

00:44:50.559 --> 00:44:52.829
long history in the 
state of Virginia. I don't think

00:44:53.561 --> 00:44:55.562
 they crafted 
different arguments, they made 

00:44:55.563 --> 00:44:59.155
the same arguments 
with respect to the equal 

00:44:59.156 --> 00:45:01.156
protection --
