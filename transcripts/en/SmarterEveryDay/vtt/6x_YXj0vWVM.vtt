Hey it's me Destin. Welcome to Smarter Every Day,
and, a blood vessel

00:00:04.060 --> 00:00:08.060
exploded in my eye. It's pretty cool. 
It's called a subconjunctival

00:00:08.080 --> 00:00:12.120
hemorrhage. I think it's pretty neat. 
Anyway, so today I'm gonna show you

00:00:12.140 --> 00:00:16.090
a little experiment that I'm doing, right before we go to the hospital and have a baby.

00:00:16.110 --> 00:00:20.480
I am, taking high speed video of a DSLR camera shutter. 
DSLR is Digital

00:00:20.500 --> 00:00:24.670
Single Lens Reflex, and this is a 
high speed camera, a Phantom

00:00:24.690 --> 00:00:28.850
that I'm pointing directly at the DSLR. 
I take the lens and the cover off here,

00:00:28.870 --> 00:00:33.030
and you can see underneath there's a mirror, and the mirror jumps out of the way, and then

00:00:33.050 --> 00:00:37.230
exposes the shutter which then, 
exposes the sensor. And there's

00:00:37.250 --> 00:00:41.400
two types of sensors in modern DSLR cameras. 
There's a CCD which is a Charge Coupled Device

00:00:41.420 --> 00:00:45.540
and there's also a CMOS sensor. 
A CMOS is a Complementary Metal

00:00:45.560 --> 00:00:49.720
Oxide Semiconductor sensor. So I'll explain what those are in a later video but for now,

00:00:49.740 --> 00:00:53.920
enjoy some wicked cool high speed footage, and

00:00:53.940 --> 00:00:58.100
sorry about the eye. eugh. It happens. Anyway, have a good one. We're going

00:00:58.120 --> 00:00:59.330
to have a baby. Bye.
