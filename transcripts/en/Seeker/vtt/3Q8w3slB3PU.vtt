00:00:05.519 --> 00:00:06.519
Hugs not bugs!

00:00:06.519 --> 00:00:08.860
Or … embraces not… bacteriophages?

00:00:08.860 --> 00:00:09.860
No…

00:00:09.860 --> 00:00:11.230
Just HUG MORE!

00:00:11.230 --> 00:00:19.300
It's good for you.

00:00:19.300 --> 00:00:23.530
It's still cold and flu season, so obviously
people are concerned about their immune strength.

00:00:23.530 --> 00:00:28.570
And now scientists from Carnegie Mellon have
found the simple hug might be a weapon on

00:00:28.570 --> 00:00:30.730
the FRONT LINE OF YOUR IMMUNE BATTLE.

00:00:30.730 --> 00:00:35.870
Humans are social creatures, we talk, we laugh,
we have intricate body language and we hug!!!

00:00:35.870 --> 00:00:36.870
YaY!

00:00:36.870 --> 00:00:41.760
I love a good hug, and this new science says
there might be more than one good reason to

00:00:41.760 --> 00:00:43.480
get a nice squeeze.

00:00:43.480 --> 00:00:47.850
It turns out your social feelings weigh far
more heavily on your physiology than you may

00:00:47.850 --> 00:00:48.850
have thought.

00:00:48.850 --> 00:00:52.250
According to a study published in last months
Psychological Science, people who are stressed

00:00:52.250 --> 00:00:56.860
or have ongoing problems in relationships
would have trouble fighting off a cold virus.

00:00:56.860 --> 00:01:01.480
The peeps at Carnegie Mellon found, those
with low QUOTE "social support" would succumb

00:01:01.480 --> 00:01:06.119
to cold symptoms more quickly than those with
high social support.

00:01:06.119 --> 00:01:10.880
They discovered this when they exposed 400
volunteers to cold viruses -- sidebar: they

00:01:10.880 --> 00:01:15.439
signed up for this, but still, wow. -- and
talked to them about their relationships,

00:01:15.439 --> 00:01:18.540
conflicts and if they'd received any hugs
that day.

00:01:18.540 --> 00:01:23.899
Their findings suggest those who received
hugs from a trusted person were less stressed

00:01:23.899 --> 00:01:27.740
and had less severe illness symptoms.

00:01:27.740 --> 00:01:31.340
The researchers think this is because they
had a broader social support structure.

00:01:31.340 --> 00:01:36.020
In the study, 75 percent of the volunteers
developed a cold, but those with higher social

00:01:36.020 --> 00:01:40.670
support and frequent hugs recovered better;
more hugs, more better.

00:01:40.670 --> 00:01:44.979
Firstly, I want to critique a little because
they didn't identify what a hug is.

00:01:44.979 --> 00:01:48.259
The ass-out hugs aren't awesome.

00:01:48.259 --> 00:01:50.159
It's got to be like, a real hug, right?

00:01:50.159 --> 00:01:55.119
I mean, according to a 2003 study a 20 second
hug with a partner followed by 10 minutes

00:01:55.119 --> 00:01:59.490
of hand-holding had significantly lower levels
of stress.

00:01:59.490 --> 00:02:04.469
And a separate study says a 10 second hug
can provide a physiological response as well,

00:02:04.469 --> 00:02:07.249
but they never really said.

00:02:07.249 --> 00:02:09.770
I go for the long hugs.

00:02:09.770 --> 00:02:11.000
Like… really long.

00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:12.000
[[awkward pause]]

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:16.390
Studies have shown hugs lower blood pressure,
decrease feelings of loneliness, and improve

00:02:16.390 --> 00:02:20.910
cardiac health, because when you hug someone,
the hormone oxytocin is released, which makes

00:02:20.910 --> 00:02:23.750
both the hugger and the huggee feel good.

00:02:23.750 --> 00:02:27.270
That oxytocin interacts with the body in a
number of ways, aside from being known as

00:02:27.270 --> 00:02:32.190
the "love hormone" because it facilitates
bonding, it also boosts chemical release which

00:02:32.190 --> 00:02:34.150
trigger immune system boosts.

00:02:34.150 --> 00:02:38.040
That also drops the levels of stress hormones
in the body, which impair immune strength,

00:02:38.040 --> 00:02:42.970
not to mention the other things stress can
do to the body.

00:02:42.970 --> 00:02:47.570
This is extra interesting news, given the
recent release by the CDC…

00:02:47.570 --> 00:02:51.180
This year's flu vaccine isn't exactly right.

00:02:51.180 --> 00:02:55.760
Before each season, the scientists use statistics
and behaviors of influenza strains from previous

00:02:55.760 --> 00:03:02.000
years, to determine which flu viruses will
dominate, and then create a vaccine for those.

00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:05.900
Last year, the CDC says, the flu vaccine was
60-percent effective -- which is pretty good.

00:03:05.900 --> 00:03:08.010
This year though, they missed one.

00:03:08.010 --> 00:03:09.050
So get hugging.

00:03:09.050 --> 00:03:12.840
In the end, giving your friend a hug might
be the better than sharing your vitamin C…

00:03:12.840 --> 00:03:14.660
and we could all use a little more love, right?

00:03:14.660 --> 00:03:16.450
Just make sure you're not already sick.

00:03:16.450 --> 00:03:18.260
That might be counterproductive.

00:03:18.260 --> 00:03:39.640
When it comes to hugs, is it better to give
or receive?!
