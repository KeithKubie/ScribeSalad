00:04:47.290 --> 00:04:47.300
had like an upload feature as well you
 

00:04:47.300 --> 00:04:51.370
had like an upload feature as well you
you you can see as I was you know some

00:04:51.370 --> 00:04:51.380
you you can see as I was you know some
 

00:04:51.380 --> 00:04:53.530
you you can see as I was you know some
of the features in the new product is

00:04:53.530 --> 00:04:53.540
of the features in the new product is
 

00:04:53.540 --> 00:04:55.450
of the features in the new product is
what we're seeing right here once we

00:04:55.450 --> 00:04:55.460
what we're seeing right here once we
 

00:04:55.460 --> 00:04:57.220
what we're seeing right here once we
hover our mouse and crawl on top of the

00:04:57.220 --> 00:04:57.230
hover our mouse and crawl on top of the
 

00:04:57.230 --> 00:04:59.800
hover our mouse and crawl on top of the
scenes we can see a preview immediately

00:04:59.800 --> 00:04:59.810
scenes we can see a preview immediately
 

00:04:59.810 --> 00:05:01.300
scenes we can see a preview immediately
and that's definitely one of the new

00:05:01.300 --> 00:05:01.310
and that's definitely one of the new
 

00:05:01.310 --> 00:05:03.520
and that's definitely one of the new
features so anyway now as you can see we

videos straight leon on youtube so as
 

00:05:28.639 --> 00:05:30.070
videos straight leon on youtube so as
you can see here the preview that's one

00:05:30.070 --> 00:05:30.080
you can see here the preview that's one
 

00:05:30.080 --> 00:05:31.659
you can see here the preview that's one
of the features we're hovering on mouse

00:05:31.659 --> 00:05:31.669
of the features we're hovering on mouse
 

00:05:31.669 --> 00:05:32.980
of the features we're hovering on mouse
across the scenes and we can see the

00:05:32.980 --> 00:05:32.990
across the scenes and we can see the
 

00:05:32.990 --> 00:05:34.480
across the scenes and we can see the
preview can see what's behind the scene

00:05:34.480 --> 00:05:34.490
preview can see what's behind the scene
 

00:05:34.490 --> 00:05:36.460
preview can see what's behind the scene
basically right now you can see on scene

00:05:36.460 --> 00:05:36.470
basically right now you can see on scene
 

00:05:36.470 --> 00:05:39.880
basically right now you can see on scene

00:05:39.880 --> 00:05:39.890
to my snack wrap was there alright so
 

00:05:39.890 --> 00:05:40.930
to my snack wrap was there alright so
that's one of the things that's

00:05:40.930 --> 00:05:40.940
that's one of the things that's
 

00:05:40.940 --> 00:05:43.000
that's one of the things that's
brilliant thing with a new version of

00:05:43.000 --> 00:05:43.010
brilliant thing with a new version of
 

00:05:43.010 --> 00:05:47.200

product so now i've made a small

00:05:47.200 --> 00:05:47.210
product so now i've made a small
 

00:05:47.210 --> 00:05:51.550
product so now i've made a small
recording and i can then go to my

00:05:51.550 --> 00:05:51.560
recording and i can then go to my
 

00:05:51.560 --> 00:05:53.920
recording and i can then go to my
recordings where i can see the recording

00:05:53.920 --> 00:05:53.930
recordings where i can see the recording
 

00:05:53.930 --> 00:05:55.870
recordings where i can see the recording
i just made i can change the thumbnail

00:05:55.870 --> 00:05:55.880
i just made i can change the thumbnail
 

00:05:55.880 --> 00:06:02.080
i just made i can change the thumbnail
view and so this recording i can

00:06:02.080 --> 00:06:02.090
view and so this recording i can
 

00:06:02.090 --> 00:06:04.240
view and so this recording i can
actually i can share in facebook twitter

00:06:04.240 --> 00:06:04.250
actually i can share in facebook twitter
 

00:06:04.250 --> 00:06:06.340
actually i can share in facebook twitter
and google+ for the first thing to share

00:06:06.340 --> 00:06:06.350
and google+ for the first thing to share
 

00:06:06.350 --> 00:06:08.670
and google+ for the first thing to share
on youtube i need to upload to YouTube

00:06:08.670 --> 00:06:08.680
on youtube i need to upload to YouTube
 

00:06:08.680 --> 00:06:12.159
on youtube i need to upload to YouTube
when I can set my title and my privacy

00:06:12.159 --> 00:06:12.169
when I can set my title and my privacy
 

00:06:12.169 --> 00:06:14.800
when I can set my title and my privacy
settings there and I can straight to go

00:06:14.800 --> 00:06:14.810
settings there and I can straight to go
 

00:06:14.810 --> 00:06:16.930
settings there and I can straight to go
and upload it that also could take a few

00:06:16.930 --> 00:06:16.940
and upload it that also could take a few
 

00:06:16.940 --> 00:06:21.779
and upload it that also could take a few
seconds but our video is not that big so

00:06:21.779 --> 00:06:21.789
seconds but our video is not that big so
 

00:06:21.789 --> 00:06:29.330
seconds but our video is not that big so
so that should be up in a few seconds

00:06:29.330 --> 00:06:29.340
 
 

00:06:29.340 --> 00:06:31.650
 
yeah we have to make the little patience

00:06:31.650 --> 00:06:31.660
yeah we have to make the little patience
 

00:06:31.660 --> 00:06:38.550
yeah we have to make the little patience
perhaps so anyway once it's up we can

00:06:38.550 --> 00:06:38.560
perhaps so anyway once it's up we can
 

00:06:38.560 --> 00:06:42.240
perhaps so anyway once it's up we can
see it here it has a link and and we can

00:06:42.240 --> 00:06:42.250
see it here it has a link and and we can
 

00:06:42.250 --> 00:06:44.070
see it here it has a link and and we can
just check it out to see that it

00:06:44.070 --> 00:06:44.080
just check it out to see that it
 

00:06:44.080 --> 00:06:45.780
just check it out to see that it
actually got uploaded well it's being

00:06:45.780 --> 00:06:45.790
actually got uploaded well it's being
 

00:06:45.790 --> 00:06:48.630
actually got uploaded well it's being
processed but it certainly yeah well

00:06:48.630 --> 00:06:48.640
processed but it certainly yeah well
 

00:06:48.640 --> 00:06:53.120
processed but it certainly yeah well
just uh it'll just take a minute out

00:06:53.120 --> 00:06:53.130
just uh it'll just take a minute out
 

00:06:53.130 --> 00:06:55.620
just uh it'll just take a minute out
what it sits there already i thing yeah

00:06:55.620 --> 00:06:55.630
what it sits there already i thing yeah
 

00:06:55.630 --> 00:06:58.110
what it sits there already i thing yeah
so that's the video we just we just

00:06:58.110 --> 00:06:58.120
so that's the video we just we just
 

00:06:58.120 --> 00:07:01.860
so that's the video we just we just
recorded a few few minutes ago let's

00:07:01.860 --> 00:07:01.870
recorded a few few minutes ago let's
 

00:07:01.870 --> 00:07:07.710
recorded a few few minutes ago let's
grab so as you can see there's a small

00:07:07.710 --> 00:07:07.720
grab so as you can see there's a small
 

00:07:07.720 --> 00:07:12.570
grab so as you can see there's a small
like consider read a little red thing in

00:07:12.570 --> 00:07:12.580
like consider read a little red thing in
 

00:07:12.580 --> 00:07:14.820
like consider read a little red thing in
the video before and that was what that

00:07:14.820 --> 00:07:14.830
the video before and that was what that
 

00:07:14.830 --> 00:07:16.830
the video before and that was what that
was upload to YouTube now we were

00:07:16.830 --> 00:07:16.840
was upload to YouTube now we were
 

00:07:16.840 --> 00:07:19.170
was upload to YouTube now we were
sharing it on Facebook and we can share

00:07:19.170 --> 00:07:19.180
sharing it on Facebook and we can share
 

00:07:19.180 --> 00:07:25.620
sharing it on Facebook and we can share
on twitter as well and so these sharing

00:07:25.620 --> 00:07:25.630
on twitter as well and so these sharing
 

00:07:25.630 --> 00:07:30.260
on twitter as well and so these sharing
features and certainly also yeah google+

00:07:30.260 --> 00:07:30.270
features and certainly also yeah google+
 

00:07:30.270 --> 00:07:33.750
features and certainly also yeah google+
and these sharing features all requires

00:07:33.750 --> 00:07:33.760
and these sharing features all requires
 

00:07:33.760 --> 00:07:39.290
and these sharing features all requires
that it's uploaded to youtube first nice

00:07:39.290 --> 00:07:39.300
 
 

00:07:39.300 --> 00:07:43.710
 
so yeah we actually yeah we track the

00:07:43.710 --> 00:07:43.720
so yeah we actually yeah we track the
 

00:07:43.720 --> 00:07:45.360
so yeah we actually yeah we track the
videos there so next time you open

00:07:45.360 --> 00:07:45.370
videos there so next time you open
 

00:07:45.370 --> 00:07:47.550
videos there so next time you open
expert you can see what videos in your

00:07:47.550 --> 00:07:47.560
expert you can see what videos in your
 

00:07:47.560 --> 00:07:51.080
expert you can see what videos in your
in my video recordings that was actually

00:07:51.080 --> 00:07:51.090
in my video recordings that was actually
 

00:07:51.090 --> 00:07:55.850
in my video recordings that was actually
that was on that's already on YouTube

00:07:55.850 --> 00:07:55.860
that was on that's already on YouTube
 

00:07:55.860 --> 00:07:59.130
that was on that's already on YouTube
sounds great and thanks for like this

00:07:59.130 --> 00:07:59.140
sounds great and thanks for like this
 

00:07:59.140 --> 00:08:01.710
sounds great and thanks for like this
amazing demo can just talk a bit about

00:08:01.710 --> 00:08:01.720
amazing demo can just talk a bit about
 

00:08:01.720 --> 00:08:03.360
amazing demo can just talk a bit about
how this app implemented what

00:08:03.360 --> 00:08:03.370
how this app implemented what
 

00:08:03.370 --> 00:08:06.690
how this app implemented what
programming languages did you use yeah

00:08:06.690 --> 00:08:06.700
programming languages did you use yeah
 

00:08:06.700 --> 00:08:10.020
programming languages did you use yeah
certainly so all our core is built in

00:08:10.020 --> 00:08:10.030
certainly so all our core is built in
 

00:08:10.030 --> 00:08:14.100
certainly so all our core is built in
C++ because we have a lot of functions

00:08:14.100 --> 00:08:14.110
C++ because we have a lot of functions
 

00:08:14.110 --> 00:08:15.270
C++ because we have a lot of functions
that are very close to the operating

00:08:15.270 --> 00:08:15.280
that are very close to the operating
 

00:08:15.280 --> 00:08:17.580
that are very close to the operating
system so that's sort of what we found

00:08:17.580 --> 00:08:17.590
system so that's sort of what we found
 

00:08:17.590 --> 00:08:20.790
system so that's sort of what we found
most suitable and the UI and other

00:08:20.790 --> 00:08:20.800
most suitable and the UI and other
 

00:08:20.800 --> 00:08:22.770
most suitable and the UI and other
functions such as for example youtube

00:08:22.770 --> 00:08:22.780
functions such as for example youtube
 

00:08:22.780 --> 00:08:25.440
functions such as for example youtube
live broadcast plugin is built using a

00:08:25.440 --> 00:08:25.450
live broadcast plugin is built using a
 

00:08:25.450 --> 00:08:28.860
live broadcast plugin is built using a
c-sharp was there any reason that you

00:08:28.860 --> 00:08:28.870
c-sharp was there any reason that you
 

00:08:28.870 --> 00:08:33.719
c-sharp was there any reason that you
guys use the C sharp well it's a it's a

00:08:33.719 --> 00:08:33.729
guys use the C sharp well it's a it's a
 

00:08:33.729 --> 00:08:36.930
guys use the C sharp well it's a it's a
pretty a lot of people know C sharp and

00:08:36.930 --> 00:08:36.940
pretty a lot of people know C sharp and
 

00:08:36.940 --> 00:08:39.390
pretty a lot of people know C sharp and
and it's easier usually to develop in a

00:08:39.390 --> 00:08:39.400
and it's easier usually to develop in a
 

00:08:39.400 --> 00:08:41.430
and it's easier usually to develop in a
face using C sharp so I think that's why

00:08:41.430 --> 00:08:41.440
face using C sharp so I think that's why
 

00:08:41.440 --> 00:08:42.149
face using C sharp so I think that's why
we

00:08:42.149 --> 00:08:42.159
we
 

00:08:42.159 --> 00:08:45.360
we
originally chose C sharp okay maybe we

00:08:45.360 --> 00:08:45.370
originally chose C sharp okay maybe we
 

00:08:45.370 --> 00:08:47.610
originally chose C sharp okay maybe we
all talked about if you guys use the or

00:08:47.610 --> 00:08:47.620
all talked about if you guys use the or
 

00:08:47.620 --> 00:08:49.740
all talked about if you guys use the or
a PS through the client libraries or

00:08:49.740 --> 00:08:49.750
a PS through the client libraries or
 

00:08:49.750 --> 00:08:53.639
a PS through the client libraries or
just like the straight to the cold well

00:08:53.639 --> 00:08:53.649
just like the straight to the cold well
 

00:08:53.649 --> 00:08:56.639
just like the straight to the cold well
I think I can answer that initially we

00:08:56.639 --> 00:08:56.649
I think I can answer that initially we
 

00:08:56.649 --> 00:08:59.309
I think I can answer that initially we
were trying to implement it in C++ but

00:08:59.309 --> 00:08:59.319
were trying to implement it in C++ but
 

00:08:59.319 --> 00:09:02.210
were trying to implement it in C++ but
since when we started our implementation

00:09:02.210 --> 00:09:02.220
since when we started our implementation
 

00:09:02.220 --> 00:09:05.670
since when we started our implementation
the live ap I was very much in beta and

00:09:05.670 --> 00:09:05.680
the live ap I was very much in beta and
 

00:09:05.680 --> 00:09:08.790
the live ap I was very much in beta and
a lot of things were changing so it

00:09:08.790 --> 00:09:08.800
a lot of things were changing so it
 

00:09:08.800 --> 00:09:10.290
a lot of things were changing so it
would give us bear it was highly

00:09:10.290 --> 00:09:10.300
would give us bear it was highly
 

00:09:10.300 --> 00:09:12.960
would give us bear it was highly
impractical for us to keep rewriting our

00:09:12.960 --> 00:09:12.970
impractical for us to keep rewriting our
 

00:09:12.970 --> 00:09:16.379
impractical for us to keep rewriting our
rest code in C++ so we just settled for

00:09:16.379 --> 00:09:16.389
rest code in C++ so we just settled for
 

00:09:16.389 --> 00:09:18.629
rest code in C++ so we just settled for
the c-sharp client library that that's

00:09:18.629 --> 00:09:18.639
the c-sharp client library that that's
 

00:09:18.639 --> 00:09:21.900
the c-sharp client library that that's
provided by you guys yeah so i should

00:09:21.900 --> 00:09:21.910
provided by you guys yeah so i should
 

00:09:21.910 --> 00:09:23.790
provided by you guys yeah so i should
mention that you guys were one of the

00:09:23.790 --> 00:09:23.800
mention that you guys were one of the
 

00:09:23.800 --> 00:09:25.619
mention that you guys were one of the
first implemented first using the beta

00:09:25.619 --> 00:09:25.629
first implemented first using the beta
 

00:09:25.629 --> 00:09:29.369
first implemented first using the beta
version as well and by using that kind

00:09:29.369 --> 00:09:29.379
version as well and by using that kind
 

00:09:29.379 --> 00:09:31.470
version as well and by using that kind
of talk about if you're using the other

00:09:31.470 --> 00:09:31.480
of talk about if you're using the other
 

00:09:31.480 --> 00:09:33.869
of talk about if you're using the other
other API is besides the live streaming

00:09:33.869 --> 00:09:33.879
other API is besides the live streaming
 

00:09:33.879 --> 00:09:35.699
other API is besides the live streaming
because I saw you were doing uploads

00:09:35.699 --> 00:09:35.709
because I saw you were doing uploads
 

00:09:35.709 --> 00:09:37.460
because I saw you were doing uploads
that you were also tracking the videos

00:09:37.460 --> 00:09:37.470
that you were also tracking the videos
 

00:09:37.470 --> 00:09:41.699
that you were also tracking the videos
yes we're actually using the data API

00:09:41.699 --> 00:09:41.709
yes we're actually using the data API
 

00:09:41.709 --> 00:09:46.319
yes we're actually using the data API
both version 2 and version 3 we mainly

00:09:46.319 --> 00:09:46.329
both version 2 and version 3 we mainly
 

00:09:46.329 --> 00:09:49.620
both version 2 and version 3 we mainly
use the version 3 API but for tracking

00:09:49.620 --> 00:09:49.630
use the version 3 API but for tracking
 

00:09:49.630 --> 00:09:52.949
use the version 3 API but for tracking
our videos such a such as tagging it

00:09:52.949 --> 00:09:52.959
our videos such a such as tagging it
 

00:09:52.959 --> 00:09:54.990
our videos such a such as tagging it
with developer tags we have to use the

00:09:54.990 --> 00:09:55.000
with developer tags we have to use the
 

00:09:55.000 --> 00:09:57.269
with developer tags we have to use the
version 2 data API because that's the

00:09:57.269 --> 00:09:57.279
version 2 data API because that's the
 

00:09:57.279 --> 00:10:00.569
version 2 data API because that's the
only library that supports developer

00:10:00.569 --> 00:10:00.579
only library that supports developer
 

00:10:00.579 --> 00:10:02.970
only library that supports developer
tags but we do hope that you will

00:10:02.970 --> 00:10:02.980
tags but we do hope that you will
 

00:10:02.980 --> 00:10:04.740
tags but we do hope that you will
support developer tags in the newer

00:10:04.740 --> 00:10:04.750
support developer tags in the newer
 

00:10:04.750 --> 00:10:06.689
support developer tags in the newer
version yeah there's definitely a

00:10:06.689 --> 00:10:06.699
version yeah there's definitely a
 

00:10:06.699 --> 00:10:09.269
version yeah there's definitely a
request on that and we hope to have the

00:10:09.269 --> 00:10:09.279
request on that and we hope to have the
 

00:10:09.279 --> 00:10:11.360
request on that and we hope to have the
developer taxonomy tree as well and

00:10:11.360 --> 00:10:11.370
developer taxonomy tree as well and
 

00:10:11.370 --> 00:10:14.009
developer taxonomy tree as well and
besides that can you guys share another

00:10:14.009 --> 00:10:14.019
besides that can you guys share another
 

00:10:14.019 --> 00:10:16.679
besides that can you guys share another
feedbacks or where you guys at have any

00:10:16.679 --> 00:10:16.689
feedbacks or where you guys at have any
 

00:10:16.689 --> 00:10:18.809
feedbacks or where you guys at have any
like surprise moments when you were

00:10:18.809 --> 00:10:18.819
like surprise moments when you were
 

00:10:18.819 --> 00:10:22.259
like surprise moments when you were
implementing this API well back when

00:10:22.259 --> 00:10:22.269
implementing this API well back when
 

00:10:22.269 --> 00:10:23.970
implementing this API well back when
when we started we were actually

00:10:23.970 --> 00:10:23.980
when we started we were actually
 

00:10:23.980 --> 00:10:26.040
when we started we were actually
surprised that there was no like

00:10:26.040 --> 00:10:26.050
surprised that there was no like
 

00:10:26.050 --> 00:10:29.340
surprised that there was no like
viewercount that was I think early this

00:10:29.340 --> 00:10:29.350
viewercount that was I think early this
 

00:10:29.350 --> 00:10:32.309
viewercount that was I think early this
year but it's already implemented now in

00:10:32.309 --> 00:10:32.319
year but it's already implemented now in
 

00:10:32.319 --> 00:10:35.249
year but it's already implemented now in
your in your latest release so easy with

00:10:35.249 --> 00:10:35.259
your in your latest release so easy with
 

00:10:35.259 --> 00:10:38.340
your in your latest release so easy with
that and we're also surprised with the

00:10:38.340 --> 00:10:38.350
that and we're also surprised with the
 

00:10:38.350 --> 00:10:41.759
that and we're also surprised with the
way broadcasts and streams were like

00:10:41.759 --> 00:10:41.769
way broadcasts and streams were like
 

00:10:41.769 --> 00:10:44.429
way broadcasts and streams were like
kind of different because we've been

00:10:44.429 --> 00:10:44.439
kind of different because we've been
 

00:10:44.439 --> 00:10:47.879
kind of different because we've been
within our other use cases we just kind

00:10:47.879 --> 00:10:47.889
within our other use cases we just kind
 

00:10:47.889 --> 00:10:51.210
within our other use cases we just kind
of stream straight to an end point and

00:10:51.210 --> 00:10:51.220
of stream straight to an end point and
 

00:10:51.220 --> 00:10:53.939
of stream straight to an end point and
that's if they have one endpoint and

00:10:53.939 --> 00:10:53.949
that's if they have one endpoint and
 

00:10:53.949 --> 00:10:56.100
that's if they have one endpoint and
then we we take note of

00:10:56.100 --> 00:10:56.110
then we we take note of
 

00:10:56.110 --> 00:10:58.880
then we we take note of
nice ring to it but in your in your API

00:10:58.880 --> 00:10:58.890
nice ring to it but in your in your API
 

00:10:58.890 --> 00:11:01.769
nice ring to it but in your in your API
there you create multiple stream objects

00:11:01.769 --> 00:11:01.779
there you create multiple stream objects
 

00:11:01.779 --> 00:11:03.300
there you create multiple stream objects
and then you bind them to broadcast

00:11:03.300 --> 00:11:03.310
and then you bind them to broadcast
 

00:11:03.310 --> 00:11:05.750
and then you bind them to broadcast
objects which are the actual events and

00:11:05.750 --> 00:11:05.760
objects which are the actual events and
 

00:11:05.760 --> 00:11:09.030
objects which are the actual events and
from what I understand is the stream

00:11:09.030 --> 00:11:09.040
from what I understand is the stream
 

00:11:09.040 --> 00:11:11.340
from what I understand is the stream
objects away so that the end points can

00:11:11.340 --> 00:11:11.350
objects away so that the end points can
 

00:11:11.350 --> 00:11:13.290
objects away so that the end points can
be reusable and the settings are very

00:11:13.290 --> 00:11:13.300
be reusable and the settings are very
 

00:11:13.300 --> 00:11:19.110
be reusable and the settings are very
much preset so you can just select which

00:11:19.110 --> 00:11:19.120
much preset so you can just select which
 

00:11:19.120 --> 00:11:21.150
much preset so you can just select which
particular broadcast resolution you're

00:11:21.150 --> 00:11:21.160
particular broadcast resolution you're
 

00:11:21.160 --> 00:11:23.160
particular broadcast resolution you're
going to be going for and then just bind

00:11:23.160 --> 00:11:23.170
going to be going for and then just bind
 

00:11:23.170 --> 00:11:25.230
going to be going for and then just bind
it to an event I think that's how you

00:11:25.230 --> 00:11:25.240
it to an event I think that's how you
 

00:11:25.240 --> 00:11:28.050
it to an event I think that's how you
want it yeah definitely some right for

00:11:28.050 --> 00:11:28.060
want it yeah definitely some right for
 

00:11:28.060 --> 00:11:33.180
want it yeah definitely some right for
me already and are there any like

00:11:33.180 --> 00:11:33.190
me already and are there any like
 

00:11:33.190 --> 00:11:36.990
me already and are there any like
features or do you guys wants to be sure

00:11:36.990 --> 00:11:37.000
features or do you guys wants to be sure
 

00:11:37.000 --> 00:11:41.699
features or do you guys wants to be sure
that Percy or prioritize um currently I

00:11:41.699 --> 00:11:41.709
that Percy or prioritize um currently I
 

00:11:41.709 --> 00:11:46.460
that Percy or prioritize um currently I
guess we would like to enable our

00:11:46.460 --> 00:11:46.470
guess we would like to enable our
 

00:11:46.470 --> 00:11:49.170
guess we would like to enable our
broadcasters to be able to interact with

00:11:49.170 --> 00:11:49.180
broadcasters to be able to interact with
 

00:11:49.180 --> 00:11:52.170
broadcasters to be able to interact with
the wits with the users more or what

00:11:52.170 --> 00:11:52.180
the wits with the users more or what
 

00:11:52.180 --> 00:11:53.490
the wits with the users more or what
sorry where there were the viewers more

00:11:53.490 --> 00:11:53.500
sorry where there were the viewers more
 

00:11:53.500 --> 00:11:56.870
sorry where there were the viewers more
and to do that we need some sort of

00:11:56.870 --> 00:11:56.880
and to do that we need some sort of
 

00:11:56.880 --> 00:11:59.100
and to do that we need some sort of
implementation for your life comments

00:11:59.100 --> 00:11:59.110
implementation for your life comments
 

00:11:59.110 --> 00:12:04.500
implementation for your life comments
but we also noticed a big delay uh from

00:12:04.500 --> 00:12:04.510
but we also noticed a big delay uh from
 

00:12:04.510 --> 00:12:09.689
but we also noticed a big delay uh from
the real-time broadcast to the actual

00:12:09.689 --> 00:12:09.699
the real-time broadcast to the actual
 

00:12:09.699 --> 00:12:11.880
the real-time broadcast to the actual
thing that you see on youtube so there's

00:12:11.880 --> 00:12:11.890
thing that you see on youtube so there's
 

00:12:11.890 --> 00:12:14.579
thing that you see on youtube so there's
like a 40 45 second delay and that would

00:12:14.579 --> 00:12:14.589
like a 40 45 second delay and that would
 

00:12:14.589 --> 00:12:19.230
like a 40 45 second delay and that would
probably kill any any sort of real-time

00:12:19.230 --> 00:12:19.240
probably kill any any sort of real-time
 

00:12:19.240 --> 00:12:22.740
probably kill any any sort of real-time
interaction between users and viewers

00:12:22.740 --> 00:12:22.750
interaction between users and viewers
 

00:12:22.750 --> 00:12:24.930
interaction between users and viewers
and broadcasters yeah yeah I think I

00:12:24.930 --> 00:12:24.940
and broadcasters yeah yeah I think I
 

00:12:24.940 --> 00:12:26.490
and broadcasters yeah yeah I think I
think it's right i mean the big missing

00:12:26.490 --> 00:12:26.500
think it's right i mean the big missing
 

00:12:26.500 --> 00:12:28.740
think it's right i mean the big missing
feature right now is really low latency

00:12:28.740 --> 00:12:28.750
feature right now is really low latency
 

00:12:28.750 --> 00:12:32.250
feature right now is really low latency
and then real-time comments yes we see a

00:12:32.250 --> 00:12:32.260
and then real-time comments yes we see a
 

00:12:32.260 --> 00:12:37.250
and then real-time comments yes we see a
lot of the big streams in gaming we're

00:12:37.250 --> 00:12:37.260
lot of the big streams in gaming we're
 

00:12:37.260 --> 00:12:40.230
lot of the big streams in gaming we're
really that the broadcast of feeds off

00:12:40.230 --> 00:12:40.240
really that the broadcast of feeds off
 

00:12:40.240 --> 00:12:42.810
really that the broadcast of feeds off
the user's comments do this go there and

00:12:42.810 --> 00:12:42.820
the user's comments do this go there and
 

00:12:42.820 --> 00:12:44.850
the user's comments do this go there and
