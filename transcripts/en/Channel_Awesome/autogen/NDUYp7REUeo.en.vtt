00:14:25.040 --> 00:14:25.050 align:start position:0%
kindergarten triangle what I thought
 

00:14:25.050 --> 00:14:30.040 align:start position:0%
kindergarten triangle what I thought
what<00:14:25.260><c> a</c><00:14:25.290><c> ritual</c><00:14:25.649><c> it</c><00:14:25.740><c> looks</c><00:14:25.920><c> like</c><00:14:26.130><c> I</c><00:14:28.399><c> had</c><00:14:29.399><c> issues</c>

00:14:30.040 --> 00:14:30.050 align:start position:0%
what a ritual it looks like I had issues
 

00:14:30.050 --> 00:14:32.990 align:start position:0%
what a ritual it looks like I had issues
it<00:14:31.050><c> also</c><00:14:31.320><c> bothered</c><00:14:31.649><c> me</c><00:14:31.740><c> how</c><00:14:31.920><c> we</c><00:14:31.980><c> don't</c><00:14:32.459><c> know</c><00:14:32.820><c> if</c>

00:14:32.990 --> 00:14:33.000 align:start position:0%
it also bothered me how we don't know if
 

00:14:33.000 --> 00:14:34.850 align:start position:0%
it also bothered me how we don't know if
the<00:14:33.120><c> kids</c><00:14:33.390><c> survived</c><00:14:33.779><c> in</c><00:14:33.990><c> the</c><00:14:34.079><c> Wonka</c><00:14:34.500><c> version</c>

00:14:34.850 --> 00:14:34.860 align:start position:0%
the kids survived in the Wonka version
 

00:14:34.860 --> 00:14:36.740 align:start position:0%
the kids survived in the Wonka version
yet<00:14:35.010><c> we</c><00:14:35.160><c> clearly</c><00:14:35.610><c> see</c><00:14:35.940><c> them</c><00:14:36.120><c> survive</c><00:14:36.480><c> in</c><00:14:36.660><c> the</c>

00:14:36.740 --> 00:14:36.750 align:start position:0%
yet we clearly see them survive in the
 

00:14:36.750 --> 00:14:38.420 align:start position:0%
yet we clearly see them survive in the
Charlie<00:14:37.020><c> version</c><00:14:37.529><c> I</c><00:14:37.770><c> think</c><00:14:38.040><c> the</c><00:14:38.130><c> message</c>

00:14:38.420 --> 00:14:38.430 align:start position:0%
Charlie version I think the message
 

00:14:38.430 --> 00:14:40.160 align:start position:0%
Charlie version I think the message
sticks<00:14:38.760><c> much</c><00:14:38.970><c> more</c><00:14:39.149><c> to</c><00:14:39.270><c> kids</c><00:14:39.510><c> when</c><00:14:39.750><c> you</c><00:14:39.839><c> don't</c>

00:14:40.160 --> 00:14:40.170 align:start position:0%
sticks much more to kids when you don't
