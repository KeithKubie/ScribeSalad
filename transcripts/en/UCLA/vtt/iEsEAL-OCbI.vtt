00:00:09.590 --> 00:00:15.599
My name is Shaina Mehta and I am the
2018 Spring Sing Executive Director.

00:00:15.599 --> 00:00:21.029
So as the director my role is to manage and oversee the entire planning process of

00:00:21.029 --> 00:00:25.529
Spring Sing from start to finish so
right now our production team is just

00:00:25.529 --> 00:00:28.859
finishing up screwing on the lights to
our truss and in a few minutes they're

00:00:28.859 --> 00:00:32.850
gonna raise that truss all the way up to
the ceiling after that we're gonna start

00:00:32.850 --> 00:00:36.809
building our stage and once our stage is
complete we're gonna put out chairs all

00:00:36.809 --> 00:00:40.290
on the floor and then after that we're
gonna just finish up and make sure Pauley

00:00:40.290 --> 00:00:44.820
is all ready to go. This year we have
15 acts all of our groups practice in

00:00:44.820 --> 00:00:48.780
various places a lot of our bigger dance
groups will practice in parking lot 4

00:00:48.780 --> 00:00:53.969
or reserved spaces in Wooden or even
anywhere on campus so it's really a

00:00:53.969 --> 00:00:58.649
range of places that the students get
together and work hard to make their

00:00:58.649 --> 00:01:03.120
piece show ready we have groups
rehearsing til 4 a.m. sometimes and

00:01:03.120 --> 00:01:07.830
really putting their all into this show.
During our show week we have tech

00:01:07.830 --> 00:01:12.390
rehearsals and a dress rehearsal here in Pauley Pavilion and then we also have Company

00:01:12.390 --> 00:01:16.770
who is our comedic troupe that helps us
to transition the show and emcee yeah

00:01:16.770 --> 00:01:22.590
they sing they dance they put together
both live skits and prepare an array of

00:01:22.590 --> 00:01:25.950
videos that get played during the show
they're awesome they're really

00:01:25.950 --> 00:01:29.990
high-quality they're really funny so

00:01:29.990 --> 00:01:35.280
I got like 14 hours of sleep last night
and took a six-hour now and then we also

00:01:35.280 --> 00:01:39.000
have stage crews who are our Bruins who
help us put this all together and make

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:42.720
it possible by building the stage and
making sure everything runs smoothly

00:01:42.720 --> 00:01:48.350
backstage. It has been the best
experience of my UCLA career.
