&gt;&gt; From the Library of
Congress in Washington, DC.

00:00:04.470 --> 00:00:05.470
[ Silence ]

00:00:06.470 --> 00:00:10.803
&gt;&gt; So, today I have a pleasure of
introducing you to Ree Drummond.

00:00:13.500 --> 00:00:13.940
Many of you I'm sure know
her as the Pioneer Woman AKA.

00:00:16.660 --> 00:00:17.660
PW AKA P-Dub.

00:00:20.790 --> 00:00:21.790


00:00:21.890 --> 00:00:26.423
[Applause] She is the force behind
a blog about her life, her family,

00:00:27.240 --> 00:00:28.053
her cooking but she's really nothing
short of a sensation as millions

00:00:30.960 --> 00:00:30.963
of readers know who every month log
on to find out what she's feeding

00:00:35.490 --> 00:00:38.356
or teaching the punks
as she calls her kids.

00:00:38.770 --> 00:00:38.883
What her Basset Hound
Charlie might be up to.

00:00:41.590 --> 00:00:45.590
What her husband looks like
today in his wranglers and chaps.

00:00:45.870 --> 00:00:46.876
Of course when a cake recipe
might look like if you decided

00:00:48.730 --> 00:00:51.796
to take 53 photos of
every step of the process.

00:00:53.260 --> 00:00:54.730
One of my favorite recent recipes
of hers, because I'm a food lover

00:00:56.190 --> 00:00:57.130
and a cook myself, is for
something recently she put

00:00:58.650 --> 00:01:01.050
up that she simply calls, the bread.

00:01:01.480 --> 00:01:02.013
You haven't seen it,
it's a loaf bread.

00:01:03.480 --> 00:01:04.840
It's 2 sticks of butter and it's
a little time in the broiler

00:01:06.120 --> 00:01:06.403
and if you are able to read this
recipe and not go to the store

00:01:09.970 --> 00:01:11.453
and buy a loaf of French bread and
2 sticks of butter and run home

00:01:12.820 --> 00:01:16.620
to your broiler, then you need
to have your pulse checked.

00:01:17.400 --> 00:01:18.173
Now, Drummond was raised
in Oklahoma but she got

00:01:19.760 --> 00:01:21.426
out as soon as she could.

00:01:21.760 --> 00:01:23.560
She fled to LA for college.

00:01:23.760 --> 00:01:25.160
And then she planned to go
to Chicago for law school

00:01:25.760 --> 00:01:26.313
but then she met her Marlboro
man on a trip back home.

00:01:28.740 --> 00:01:29.086
She ended up living on a
4th generation cattle ranch.

00:01:31.860 --> 00:01:32.950
And now, in addition to the
blog, she has her first cookbook,

00:01:34.770 --> 00:01:36.186
"The Pioneer Woman Cooks" which
made it all the way to the top

00:01:37.420 --> 00:01:41.686
of amazon.com's cookbook rating
by the virtue of pre-orders alone

00:01:42.450 --> 00:01:42.630
and her series on the
blog from Black Heels

00:01:45.070 --> 00:01:45.623
to Tractor Wheels is also
headed for publication

00:01:47.650 --> 00:01:47.660
and she's also sold
the movie rights.

00:01:50.040 --> 00:01:51.206
So, ladies and gentlemen,
please welcome, Ree Drummonds.

00:01:52.540 --> 00:01:53.540
[ Applause ]

00:02:02.180 --> 00:02:02.193
&gt;&gt; I was okay until he said this
is being videotaped would wind

00:02:06.300 --> 00:02:06.653
up in the archives of the Library
of Congress, so I gotta go, bye.

00:02:10.280 --> 00:02:10.303
[Laughter] It's so nice to see you
all here and it's such an honor

00:02:14.590 --> 00:02:16.256
to be here in Washington.

00:02:16.590 --> 00:02:16.980
I was walking through
the tent just--

00:02:18.600 --> 00:02:19.383
I almost choked up a
couple of times that I--

00:02:20.750 --> 00:02:24.083
just kind of the pride I
felt just seeing the kids.

00:02:24.470 --> 00:02:24.640
I wake up often with cows on my
porch that don't belong there

00:02:28.300 --> 00:02:30.633
and the things that come from cows.

00:02:31.600 --> 00:02:34.933
I won't go into detail but
that's sort of a weekly,

00:02:36.530 --> 00:02:37.050
weekly struggle is cleaning
the manure off my porch.

00:02:39.410 --> 00:02:41.810
And isn't this a classy
presentation?

00:02:42.760 --> 00:02:43.760
[Laughter].

00:02:44.760 --> 00:02:45.293
I've already talked about
sweat and manure and--

00:02:47.360 --> 00:02:49.160
what else can I talk about?

00:02:50.170 --> 00:02:50.250
But, I'm gonna-- by virtue
the fact that I'm a blogger.

00:02:53.690 --> 00:02:53.706
You know, I think a blogger
is like the complete opp-- -

00:02:57.340 --> 00:02:58.096
&gt;&gt; [Inaudible] with you or your
blog or your cookbook or anything

00:03:00.850 --> 00:03:01.203
but I'm interested
in hearing about it.

00:03:03.030 --> 00:03:03.230
So, I'd like to hear a little bit

00:03:05.030 --> 00:03:07.830
about your cookbook
and how it got started.

00:03:08.200 --> 00:03:12.200
&gt;&gt; Okay. I-- like I said, I
started my personal blog in 2006.

00:03:13.230 --> 00:03:14.363
It was on a whim.

00:03:15.230 --> 00:03:16.430
I have 4 children.

00:03:17.230 --> 00:03:18.363
My baby had just been
weaned which always sounds

00:03:19.230 --> 00:03:21.096
like a livestock term to me.

00:03:21.740 --> 00:03:23.073
I've weaned my baby.

00:03:24.040 --> 00:03:26.440
And my husband had
taken all the kids

00:03:26.690 --> 00:03:29.090
to work cattle with him for the day.

00:03:29.650 --> 00:03:29.950
So, I found myself in this house and
I just wondered over to the computer

00:03:34.150 --> 00:03:34.626
and thought, "I'm gonna
start one those blog things."

00:03:37.140 --> 00:03:40.673
In 2006, blogs were definitely
around but they weren't

00:03:40.800 --> 00:03:41.203
as prevalent obviously
as they are now.

00:03:42.930 --> 00:03:45.330
I thought a blog was a free website.

00:03:45.460 --> 00:03:48.793
I had no idea it involved
interaction from readers.

00:03:51.060 --> 00:03:53.860
But I thought it would
be a good way for me

00:03:53.970 --> 00:03:56.036
to share photos with my mother.

00:03:56.930 --> 00:03:59.530
And I've posted a few
photos of my kids.

00:04:00.260 --> 00:04:01.393
I had one reader.

00:04:02.260 --> 00:04:03.993
It was my mother, in fact.

00:04:04.260 --> 00:04:04.420
And then I started posting
stories from my pasts,

00:04:07.300 --> 00:04:11.700
kind of the embarrassing stories
that I would whip out at you know,

00:04:12.520 --> 00:04:14.986
parties or get-togethers
with friends.

00:04:15.380 --> 00:04:16.083
Well, this wasn't necessarily
embarrassing but when I was

00:04:18.410 --> 00:04:20.943
in Los Angeles, I ran
into James Garner

00:04:20.970 --> 00:04:23.103
in an elevator and he kissed me.

00:04:25.220 --> 00:04:29.353
So, I always like to say, I kissed
James Garner in an elevator.

00:04:29.520 --> 00:04:33.920
And Gary Coleman, rest his soul,
I bumped into him when I was young

00:04:34.410 --> 00:04:38.743
and starstruck when I just moved
to Los Angeles as an 18-year-old.

00:04:39.860 --> 00:04:40.220
I saw him in Benihana
and he was eating.

00:04:42.100 --> 00:04:46.233
And I just though, why wouldn't
anybody want a freckled redhead

00:04:47.370 --> 00:04:48.503
to walk up to them in Benihana
and ask for their autographs.

00:04:50.170 --> 00:04:52.770
So, I asked for Gary
Coleman's autograph

00:04:53.630 --> 00:04:55.496
and he seemed a little bit--

00:04:56.370 --> 00:05:00.036
he kinda wanted to eat his
meal which you can understand

00:05:00.250 --> 00:05:00.850
but he said, "Well,
give me your address

00:05:02.250 --> 00:05:04.183
and I'll send you a fan kit."

00:05:04.250 --> 00:05:04.360
So, I leaned down to
write my address

00:05:06.540 --> 00:05:09.873
and I spilled a steaming
hot pot of tea in his lap.

00:05:10.660 --> 00:05:11.260
[Laughter] And it was--
steam was rising

00:05:12.660 --> 00:05:15.126
from his khakis and
so I got that out.

00:05:15.310 --> 00:05:18.043
There was a lot I needed
to purge my solo.

00:05:18.470 --> 00:05:22.470
So, I was posting these embarrassing
stories and then I moved

00:05:23.260 --> 00:05:25.260
into rural life, country life.

00:05:26.480 --> 00:05:30.413
And I was a real fish out of
water as I repeat over and over

00:05:31.980 --> 00:05:33.846
when I moved to the country.

00:05:33.980 --> 00:05:38.513
I grew up on a golf course, so I
knew nothing about saddling a horse,

00:05:39.220 --> 00:05:39.343
finding livestock in your yards.

00:05:41.230 --> 00:05:41.950
So, when I married my
husband, it was all new to me.

00:05:43.910 --> 00:05:47.643
So then, my blog sort of took
the direction of recording,

00:05:48.690 --> 00:05:52.823
chronicling my daily adjustment
and transition to country life.

00:05:53.540 --> 00:05:57.740
About 8 months into my blog, I
was getting ready to cook a steak

00:05:59.190 --> 00:05:59.233
and I thought, "Well, I blog about
every other darn thing in my life,

00:06:03.680 --> 00:06:06.413
you know, my children,
dogs, my thoughts."

00:06:06.900 --> 00:06:10.366
So, I took my camera to the
kitchen and I took photos

00:06:11.920 --> 00:06:13.786
of myself cooking the steak.

00:06:14.180 --> 00:06:18.113
Everything from seasoning it
to flipping it on the grill pan

00:06:18.970 --> 00:06:23.436
on my stove, and I literally was
down there with my camera like this

00:06:24.450 --> 00:06:26.516
and I have the tongs like this.

00:06:26.570 --> 00:06:29.903
And I just wrote a post
called how to cook a steak.

00:06:30.030 --> 00:06:30.373
I thought, "Well, that's
the end of my blog."

00:06:32.620 --> 00:06:34.886
You know, "Who wants to see that?"

00:06:35.130 --> 00:06:37.596
But I wound up posting
about 17 photos

00:06:37.640 --> 00:06:39.640
of this steak-grilling process

00:06:39.850 --> 00:06:42.783
and there was an immediate
positive response.

00:06:44.350 --> 00:06:44.530
And what I learned-- I kept
doing recipes like that.

00:06:47.570 --> 00:06:51.836
I did my lasagna and then I did
my chocolate cake and I kept kind

00:06:53.200 --> 00:06:55.600
of posting the recipes that I cooked

00:06:56.390 --> 00:06:59.190
within the context of
my life on the ranch.

00:06:59.770 --> 00:07:02.703
And what I learned was
that a lot of people--

00:07:03.260 --> 00:07:04.113
whether they knew how
to cook or not already,

00:07:05.340 --> 00:07:09.140
they appreciated the assurance
not just of the final photo

00:07:12.450 --> 00:07:15.116
but of the processed
shots along the way.

00:07:15.700 --> 00:07:16.110
And I was always a cookbook
buyer that had to have a photo

00:07:19.090 --> 00:07:21.090
of the finished dish at least.

00:07:21.440 --> 00:07:25.573
And often, the finished photo is
styled and perfect and lovely.

00:07:27.330 --> 00:07:29.196
So, my finished photos are--

00:07:29.330 --> 00:07:29.760
you know, just there's my
steak on the plate, you know.

00:07:32.500 --> 00:07:36.300
So, really, the cooking section
of my site started growing

00:07:37.640 --> 00:07:40.706
and the cookbook-- gosh,
this is a long answer.

00:07:42.290 --> 00:07:45.423
I promised not to do this
with future questions.

00:07:46.920 --> 00:07:47.076
The cookbook came about
probably a year and a half later

00:07:50.430 --> 00:07:54.630
and it really is just a natural
extension of my cooking section.

00:07:55.060 --> 00:07:55.153
I wanted it to be the same tone,

00:07:57.100 --> 00:08:00.300
the same step by step
format, the same weirdness.

00:08:03.040 --> 00:08:03.743
I mean, if I make a mistake
midway, I'm not gonna go back

00:08:06.070 --> 00:08:10.603
and start the recipe over so, you
know, I just sorta pay no attention

00:08:10.670 --> 00:08:10.803
to that mistake I just made and.

00:08:12.670 --> 00:08:17.470
I think many readers appreciate just
the assurance that if I can do this,

00:08:18.900 --> 00:08:19.170
they can do it too,
because I'm not a chef.

00:08:21.430 --> 00:08:22.213
I'm not-- I wasn't trained
in a culinary school so.

00:08:23.980 --> 00:08:28.380
&gt;&gt; I like to know more about the
lodge and what its future may hold

00:08:31.370 --> 00:08:35.170
and would it involve anything
such as a bed and breakfast?

00:08:35.670 --> 00:08:37.070
&gt;&gt; Bed and breakfast?

00:08:38.130 --> 00:08:40.796
Well, we have a guest
house on our ranch.

00:08:40.930 --> 00:08:41.150
Many who've read my site for
a while know about the lodge.

00:08:44.510 --> 00:08:49.110
It was an old guest house and it's
where my husband lived when we met.

00:08:51.070 --> 00:08:55.536
And when I started writing this
romantic Green Acres meets Harlequin

00:08:56.700 --> 00:09:00.833
Romance serial on my site, a lot
of it took place in the lodge.

00:09:04.240 --> 00:09:04.956
Well, a couple of years
ago-- 2 and a half years ago,

00:09:06.990 --> 00:09:10.256
it was termite infested
and the electric was shut,

00:09:12.480 --> 00:09:17.080
the plumbing was shut, so we were
very, very close to tearing it down.

00:09:17.380 --> 00:09:20.180
And we just decided to
renovate it instead.

00:09:23.000 --> 00:09:23.723
[Laughter] It was kind of like
riding a horse into a burning barn.

00:09:26.610 --> 00:09:28.440
We just-- you know, we didn't know
what we were getting ourselves into

00:09:29.380 --> 00:09:31.980
and it turned into a
really big project.

00:09:33.580 --> 00:09:36.513
But since I'm a blogger,
I thought, "Perfect.

00:09:36.730 --> 00:09:38.063
I'll blog about it."

00:09:38.730 --> 00:09:38.753
So, I posted at least weekly
updates of the lodge project

00:09:42.440 --> 00:09:44.506
and I actually had readers kind

00:09:45.160 --> 00:09:48.360
of help me decide some
materials and some colors.

00:09:50.520 --> 00:09:53.853
And so, the lodge now-- we
mostly use it for family

00:09:55.460 --> 00:09:57.126
and friend get-togethers.

00:09:57.740 --> 00:09:58.273
But I've actually used
it several times

00:09:59.740 --> 00:10:01.806
to have blogging get-togethers.

00:10:02.870 --> 00:10:05.936
&gt;&gt; Sometimes, I'll invite
a guest food blogger.

00:10:06.520 --> 00:10:06.636
I don't know if many
of you might have heard

00:10:09.270 --> 00:10:11.270
of Smitten Kitchen, Bakerella.

00:10:12.350 --> 00:10:15.016
Bakerella has a new
book out, it's great.

00:10:15.160 --> 00:10:15.933
And then I invite readers from
both of our audiences to come and--

00:10:18.720 --> 00:10:20.853
so, it's kind of fun to have it.

00:10:20.980 --> 00:10:24.846
As far as a bed and breakfast,
I don't have any plans to do

00:10:25.860 --> 00:10:30.460
that because then I'd have to wash
the sheets on a schedule and I sort

00:10:30.760 --> 00:10:33.960
of like being more free,
otherwise known as lazy,

00:10:36.540 --> 00:10:40.273
[Laughter] about getting the
beds made so, maybe someday.

00:10:41.650 --> 00:10:42.650
Yeah?

00:10:43.650 --> 00:10:44.650
&gt;&gt; Hi.

00:10:45.650 --> 00:10:46.650
&gt;&gt; Hi.

00:10:47.650 --> 00:10:48.983
&gt;&gt; Glad you're here.

00:10:49.650 --> 00:10:50.650
&gt;&gt; Thank you.

00:10:51.650 --> 00:10:54.183
&gt;&gt; One thing I love about your blog
and the cookbook is the art work.

00:10:53.650 --> 00:10:54.650
Who does that?

00:10:55.650 --> 00:10:56.916
Where is that from?

00:10:57.650 --> 00:10:58.516
I just wanna be heard
a little bit about it?

00:10:59.650 --> 00:11:01.316
&gt;&gt; Now, across the top or the
little ones at the bottom?

00:11:01.650 --> 00:11:03.650
&gt;&gt; Yeah, the top and like the
cow girls that are in and like,

00:11:03.650 --> 00:11:04.316
the book you have beautiful
flowers and--

00:11:05.650 --> 00:11:07.183
&gt;&gt; Well, I'll tell you.

00:11:07.650 --> 00:11:09.250
It's not a trade secret.

00:11:09.650 --> 00:11:10.650
[Laughter]

00:11:11.650 --> 00:11:12.650
&gt;&gt; Yeah.

00:11:13.650 --> 00:11:14.583
&gt;&gt; Well, there's-- there
are several answers.

00:11:15.650 --> 00:11:16.916
I have an artist, called,
named Maia Chavez Larkin

00:11:17.650 --> 00:11:21.716
and she actually did some custom
illustrations of my children.

00:11:21.790 --> 00:11:26.456
So the ones of the little cowgirls
and cowboys, those were custom made.

00:11:27.640 --> 00:11:30.040
Now, the art that's
in my site banner

00:11:30.630 --> 00:11:34.363
that I changed once a month
is nothing but Dover clipart.

00:11:36.630 --> 00:11:39.696
Yeah, it's Dover-- if
you Google Dover clipart,

00:11:40.750 --> 00:11:45.016
they have probably 50 just paperback
books with a CD in the back.

00:11:46.530 --> 00:11:49.463
And they have vintage
flowers, vintage images

00:11:50.830 --> 00:11:52.830
and I just-- I love the style.

00:11:52.840 --> 00:11:54.040
&gt;&gt; It's beautiful.

00:11:54.840 --> 00:11:57.240
&gt;&gt; And I am not an artist so I
couldn't draw a flower and if I did,

00:11:56.840 --> 00:11:58.440
I would have no website,

00:11:58.840 --> 00:11:59.973
because people would be
like, "What an amateur."

00:12:00.840 --> 00:12:01.840
[Laughter]

00:12:02.840 --> 00:12:04.040
&gt;&gt; It looks great.

00:12:04.840 --> 00:12:05.840
&gt;&gt; Thank you.

00:12:06.840 --> 00:12:07.840
Yes?

00:12:08.840 --> 00:12:09.840
&gt;&gt; Hi.

00:12:10.840 --> 00:12:11.840
&gt;&gt; Hi.

00:12:12.840 --> 00:12:15.573
&gt;&gt; As a former horrible cook, I like
to say thank you for your cookbook.

00:12:14.840 --> 00:12:15.973
&gt;&gt; Oh, thank you.

00:12:16.840 --> 00:12:18.973
&gt;&gt; Because all the pictures are
very helpful and as a current--

00:12:18.840 --> 00:12:20.040
kinda alright cook, I have
a proposition for you.

00:12:20.840 --> 00:12:21.596
Would you like to trade cooking
lessons for flying lessons?

00:12:23.950 --> 00:12:24.950
[ Laughter ]

00:12:26.100 --> 00:12:26.500
&gt;&gt; Are you aware that I hate to fly?

00:12:28.100 --> 00:12:29.100
[Laughter]

00:12:30.100 --> 00:12:30.366
&gt;&gt; I am. I could change your mind.

00:12:32.100 --> 00:12:32.500
&gt;&gt; I just conquered a fear of flying

00:12:34.100 --> 00:12:34.766
about a year ago, so--
so you're a pilot?

00:12:36.100 --> 00:12:37.100
&gt;&gt; Yup.

00:12:38.100 --> 00:12:39.100
&gt;&gt; Great.

00:12:40.100 --> 00:12:42.100
&gt;&gt; I'll give you-- [Laughter].

00:12:42.100 --> 00:12:42.330
I'll give you cooking
lessons with-- for nothing.

00:12:45.070 --> 00:12:45.403
[Laughter] In exchange for nothing.

00:12:47.070 --> 00:12:49.003
&gt;&gt; That's a really good deal.

00:12:49.070 --> 00:12:50.070
Alright.

00:12:51.070 --> 00:12:52.736
&gt;&gt; Where are you a pilot?

00:12:53.070 --> 00:12:54.070
Where are you?

00:12:55.070 --> 00:12:56.736
&gt;&gt; I'm based in Atlanta and
I had a trip up here and saw

00:12:57.070 --> 00:12:58.736
that you're gonna be here so
I just happened to be here.

00:12:59.070 --> 00:12:59.670
&gt;&gt; Ironically, if I
took flying lessons,

00:13:01.070 --> 00:13:01.503
it would probably help my
fear knowing but it's a--

00:13:03.970 --> 00:13:04.836
it a fear that was fostered by
living in the country for 10 years

00:13:07.370 --> 00:13:09.036
and never going anywhere.

00:13:09.370 --> 00:13:10.370
So--

00:13:11.370 --> 00:13:11.503
&gt;&gt; Well, if you wanna change it.

00:13:13.370 --> 00:13:13.436
I'm sure we could help you out.

00:13:15.370 --> 00:13:16.370
&gt;&gt; E-mail me.

00:13:17.370 --> 00:13:18.636
&gt;&gt; Okay. [Laughter]

00:13:19.370 --> 00:13:19.703
&gt;&gt; You might be sorry you did that.

00:13:21.370 --> 00:13:22.370
[ Laughter]

00:13:23.370 --> 00:13:24.770
&gt;&gt; I'll write you before
my trips, and I'll be like,

00:13:25.370 --> 00:13:26.103
"Are you sure these
things don't go down?"

00:13:27.370 --> 00:13:28.436
&gt;&gt; I'm positive.

00:13:29.370 --> 00:13:31.370
[Laughter] Alright, thank you.

00:13:31.370 --> 00:13:32.370
&gt;&gt; Thanks.

00:13:33.370 --> 00:13:34.370
[ Pause ]

00:13:35.370 --> 00:13:35.703
&gt;&gt; Oops, I'll repeat your question.

00:13:37.370 --> 00:13:37.903
&gt;&gt; Okay, first of all
thank you so much

00:13:39.370 --> 00:13:39.703
for letting us in on a daily basis.

00:13:41.370 --> 00:13:42.236
You are like my favorite
past time everyday.

00:13:43.370 --> 00:13:44.503
&gt;&gt; Oh, thank you.

00:13:45.370 --> 00:13:47.036
&gt;&gt; And my question for you
is, being an amateur blogger,

00:13:47.370 --> 00:13:47.503
how do you keep the consistency?

00:13:49.370 --> 00:13:50.703
You obviously have a million
other things going on.

00:13:51.370 --> 00:13:53.170
How do you just keep it up?

00:13:53.370 --> 00:13:55.303
So, [inaudible] keep your
readership up by being consistent?

00:13:55.370 --> 00:13:56.236
&gt;&gt; How do I keep up my
blogging consistency?

00:13:57.370 --> 00:13:58.636
&gt;&gt; Yeah, I mean you have
posts several times a day

00:13:59.370 --> 00:14:00.970
and it always amazes me.

00:14:01.370 --> 00:14:04.770
&gt;&gt; Oh, some are more quality
than others, but, well,

00:14:07.410 --> 00:14:09.410
it helps that I love blogging.

00:14:09.770 --> 00:14:13.570
And it also helps that I have
blogged from almost 5 years.

00:14:13.960 --> 00:14:17.826
And it's amazing-- when I looked
back at my writing in 2006

00:14:19.590 --> 00:14:22.923
in the early days-- and I
don't do that very often,

00:14:23.010 --> 00:14:26.676
I'm amazed at how much less
polished and sophisticated--

00:14:28.200 --> 00:14:28.546
not that my writing is all
that sophisticated now,

00:14:31.120 --> 00:14:34.986
that I think anything you do
for an extended period of time

00:14:35.450 --> 00:14:38.983
and anything you do regularly,
you're going to improve

00:14:39.770 --> 00:14:40.413
and not only will you improve
but it will become easier for you

00:14:43.260 --> 00:14:45.126
and blogging for me is easy.

00:14:46.560 --> 00:14:51.026
I can-- I'm able to sort of sit
down at the computer and let it flow

00:14:51.470 --> 00:14:55.803
and I'm anyone who's having trouble
kind of getting into the swing

00:14:55.900 --> 00:15:00.300
of blogging that wants to blog, I
always say blog, just blog daily.

00:15:01.070 --> 00:15:02.806
And there are gonna be days when
you wake up and say, I have nothing

00:15:03.800 --> 00:15:07.600
to say to the world and that
actually happened to me once.

00:15:07.990 --> 00:15:12.056
In September of 2007, I woke up
and I had the most raging case

00:15:13.020 --> 00:15:13.056
of writer's block and I'd
never experienced it before

00:15:16.450 --> 00:15:18.050
and I had nothing write.

00:15:19.040 --> 00:15:22.640
And I remembered a chapter
that I had written of a book

00:15:23.340 --> 00:15:26.606
that I decided not to
write-- did that make sense?

00:15:26.620 --> 00:15:29.553
But it began with the
night I met my husband.

00:15:30.690 --> 00:15:31.313
And it was called, The
Night I Met Marlboro Man.

00:15:33.200 --> 00:15:37.400
So, since I had nothing to say
that day, I just whipped that out

00:15:37.520 --> 00:15:38.550
and put it on my website and that
was the first chapter Black Heels

00:15:40.890 --> 00:15:42.090
to Tractor Wheels.

00:15:42.890 --> 00:15:45.890
And it turned into a
45-chapter serial online.

00:15:46.890 --> 00:15:48.486
And it was-- 'cause I didn't
give in to the writer's block,

00:15:49.160 --> 00:15:49.363
I didn't write but I
got something up anyway.

00:15:51.890 --> 00:15:53.423
So, just stick with it.

00:15:53.890 --> 00:15:55.103
You'd be amazed a year from now
how much easier blogging is.

00:15:56.610 --> 00:15:57.610
&gt;&gt; Thank you.

00:15:59.350 --> 00:16:02.616
&gt;&gt; And don't be afraid to
just embarrass yourself.

00:16:02.740 --> 00:16:03.490
[Laughter] Some days when I
didn't have anything to write,

00:16:05.790 --> 00:16:09.123
I would record myself
singing Ethel Merman's songs.

00:16:11.260 --> 00:16:13.793
There's no business
like show business.

00:16:14.940 --> 00:16:16.073
Raise your hand if you
know who Ethel Merman is.

00:16:16.940 --> 00:16:17.940
[Applause].

00:16:18.940 --> 00:16:20.540
&gt;&gt; Not very many people.

00:16:20.940 --> 00:16:23.136
[Laughter] So, most of you are
basically sitting there going what

00:16:23.010 --> 00:16:24.010
is she doing?

00:16:25.370 --> 00:16:26.370
[Laughter] Yes?

00:16:27.370 --> 00:16:29.036
&gt;&gt; I'm just wondering if your
kids actually see the blog

00:16:29.370 --> 00:16:31.110
and how did they deal with the
pictures and everything else--

00:16:31.630 --> 00:16:33.763
like, how do they feel about it?

00:16:34.450 --> 00:16:35.530
&gt;&gt; Well, it sort of like that you
know, I've been doing it for so long

00:16:37.970 --> 00:16:38.300
and have been taking
pictures of them for so long

00:16:40.840 --> 00:16:44.240
that they really don't know
any-- they're prisoners.

00:16:44.850 --> 00:16:45.516
[Laughter] Basically,
is what I'm saying.

00:16:46.850 --> 00:16:49.383
My boys are 7-- at
how old are my boys?

00:16:49.840 --> 00:16:52.973
Eight and 6, I have to
think about it sometimes.

00:16:53.590 --> 00:16:54.716
And they could care less about
computers, so they-- they really--

00:16:56.730 --> 00:16:58.220
they know I have a blog and
they know I have a cookbook

00:16:58.840 --> 00:17:00.440
but they don't check in.

00:17:00.840 --> 00:17:02.640
My daughters are 13 and 11,

00:17:02.840 --> 00:17:05.906
so they're becoming more
interested in reading.

00:17:06.000 --> 00:17:09.000
And fortunately while
there have been moments,

00:17:09.870 --> 00:17:12.270
I can't really think
of any examples.

00:17:13.260 --> 00:17:15.660
My content is pretty
family friendly.

00:17:16.210 --> 00:17:16.590
I mean, there are some things
that children might find boring

00:17:19.830 --> 00:17:24.096
that I don't have to worry that
if my girls pulled up my website,

00:17:24.400 --> 00:17:27.466
they would come across
the F-bomb or you know--

00:17:28.100 --> 00:17:28.966
&gt;&gt; But is there anything--
is there anything

00:17:30.100 --> 00:17:31.710
that they would rather you haven't
shared like is there anything

00:17:32.690 --> 00:17:35.223
that they like, "No
ma, don't do this?"

00:17:35.620 --> 00:17:37.020
&gt;&gt; You know, not yet.

00:17:37.620 --> 00:17:39.486
But I'm-- I mean-- you know,

00:17:39.620 --> 00:17:40.486
I'm gonna just play it
by ear and not realm.

00:17:41.620 --> 00:17:45.553
I can't imagine that I'll say,
"Stand there and look happy."

00:17:45.950 --> 00:17:47.216
So, we'll just see.

00:17:47.950 --> 00:17:48.616
So far, they've sort
of have fun with it.

00:17:49.950 --> 00:17:51.166
Now, that is the common
question I get about my husband.

00:17:52.400 --> 00:17:52.683
Has there ever been
anything that I've posted

00:17:55.050 --> 00:17:56.983
that he's had a problem with.

00:17:57.820 --> 00:18:02.486
And the answer is no, unless-- the
only time he's ever had a problem is

00:18:03.380 --> 00:18:03.633
when I've gotten an
agricultural fact incorrect.

00:18:06.260 --> 00:18:09.126
[Laughter] And then he
can't sleep for days.

00:18:09.630 --> 00:18:10.513
I mean, he's just-- he'll be tossing
and turning and I'll be like,

00:18:13.080 --> 00:18:13.413
"Are you still worried about that?"

00:18:15.080 --> 00:18:17.880
And he'd be like, "It's
a steer not a cow."

00:18:18.530 --> 00:18:20.930
So, generally it's gone pretty well.

00:18:22.370 --> 00:18:26.903
&gt;&gt; As a beneficiary, I just like to
thank you for the cinnamon rolls.

00:18:27.580 --> 00:18:28.580
[Laughter]

00:18:29.580 --> 00:18:30.713
&gt;&gt; Oh, thank you.

00:18:31.580 --> 00:18:32.830
That's probably my favorite recipe
of mine so I appreciate that.

00:18:34.530 --> 00:18:35.530
Thank you.

00:18:36.530 --> 00:18:37.530
They're nonfat.

00:18:39.880 --> 00:18:40.880
[Laughter] Yes?

00:18:41.880 --> 00:18:44.116
&gt;&gt; Hi, do you have any more details
on the possible movie version

00:18:43.910 --> 00:18:44.110
of Black Heels to Tractor Wheels?

00:18:45.910 --> 00:18:46.643
&gt;&gt; Possible movie version
of Black Heels--

00:18:47.910 --> 00:18:48.330
and that's another thing when I
was referencing these extraordinary

00:18:51.890 --> 00:18:54.556
thing developments
that have taken place.

00:18:55.960 --> 00:18:56.416
It's probably going to move forward
that the thing that attracted me

00:18:59.970 --> 00:19:04.570
about a possible movie version of
the love story is that first of all,

00:19:06.030 --> 00:19:08.630
it was the gals who
did Julie and Julia,

00:19:10.060 --> 00:19:10.200
Sony Pictures and they're all women.

00:19:12.320 --> 00:19:16.853
So I think they would sorta get,
you know, the fizzy, in love things.

00:19:18.140 --> 00:19:19.383
And I think they were also
interested in the angle that might--

00:19:21.030 --> 00:19:24.163
as I was falling in love
with my cowboy husband,

00:19:24.500 --> 00:19:27.033
my parents' marriage
was falling apart.

00:19:27.650 --> 00:19:31.116
And I chronicled that both
on my site and in my book.

00:19:31.500 --> 00:19:32.500
Boy, I'm sorry.

00:19:33.500 --> 00:19:33.833
I didn't mean to depress everybody.

00:19:35.500 --> 00:19:35.900
But the other thing that feels to me

00:19:37.500 --> 00:19:39.240
about a possible movie is I
don't really have to do any work.

00:19:39.760 --> 00:19:41.426
So, but I-- it'll be fun.

00:19:41.760 --> 00:19:42.026
We'll just kinda see what happens.

00:19:43.760 --> 00:19:44.063
&gt;&gt; So will you get to like give
input on the screenplay at all?

00:19:47.590 --> 00:19:51.056
&gt;&gt; I think-- I don't think
I have official you know--

00:19:51.630 --> 00:19:52.180
I don't think I can
mix anything officially

00:19:53.880 --> 00:19:54.560
but I think they will
naturally, probably be interested

00:19:56.800 --> 00:19:58.733
in a little input from me so.

00:19:59.130 --> 00:20:00.130
&gt;&gt; Very cool.

00:20:01.130 --> 00:20:02.780
&gt;&gt; For instance, I thought
Elle MacPherson should play me.

00:20:03.280 --> 00:20:06.480
[Laughter] But they haven't
returned that e-mail.

00:20:06.930 --> 00:20:07.930
Yes?

00:20:09.180 --> 00:20:10.180
&gt;&gt; Hi.

00:20:11.180 --> 00:20:12.180
&gt;&gt; Hi.

00:20:13.180 --> 00:20:14.980
&gt;&gt; I'm so glad you're here.

00:20:15.180 --> 00:20:16.180
&gt;&gt; Thank you.

00:20:17.180 --> 00:20:18.913
&gt;&gt; And sort of my boyfriend
said, "Oh, that pioneer woman

00:20:19.180 --> 00:20:21.713
that I tell you about that I have
my cookbook laying in the kitchen."

00:20:21.180 --> 00:20:21.980
He's like, "Oh, tell
her I love her salsa."

00:20:23.180 --> 00:20:23.446
So, he wanted me to tell you that.

00:20:25.180 --> 00:20:26.446
He loves the salsa.

00:20:27.180 --> 00:20:28.913
&gt;&gt; I love that salsa, too.

00:20:29.180 --> 00:20:30.180
Thank you.

00:20:31.180 --> 00:20:33.180
&gt;&gt; And I just had one sort of
question and one other comment.

00:20:33.180 --> 00:20:35.380
I guess my comment is one of the
things I love about your site--

00:20:35.180 --> 00:20:37.580
and I just said that you know I
guess 'cause I have never have time

00:20:37.180 --> 00:20:37.246
to leave a comment or anything.

00:20:39.180 --> 00:20:41.180
I love checking it to see the
wonderful pictures that you put

00:20:41.180 --> 00:20:42.646
up of the country because
I'm an east coast city girl

00:20:43.180 --> 00:20:44.513
and I work downtown here
in DC and I had never seen

00:20:45.180 --> 00:20:45.313
such great pictures I guess of--

00:20:47.180 --> 00:20:48.313
&gt;&gt; Oh, thank you.

00:20:49.180 --> 00:20:51.846
&gt;&gt; Way out there, where you just--
it's amazing to me that you look out

00:20:51.180 --> 00:20:53.490
and see nothing 'cause if you've
lived in the city your whole life,

00:20:53.270 --> 00:20:54.566
you'd never have gotten a
chance to see things like that

00:20:55.640 --> 00:20:56.106
so that's really cool
to see everyday.

00:20:57.640 --> 00:20:59.403
And I guess I just had a question
of whether you're planning

00:20:59.810 --> 00:21:01.676
on writing another cookbook?

00:21:01.810 --> 00:21:01.876
&gt;&gt; I am doing another cookbook.

00:21:03.810 --> 00:21:04.410
It'll be a little while
before it's out.

00:21:05.810 --> 00:21:07.743
I'm gonna do the Black Heels.

00:21:07.810 --> 00:21:08.563
It'll be out in February and then
I have a Charlie children's book

00:21:11.390 --> 00:21:11.933
coming out in the middle
of next year which is sort

00:21:14.180 --> 00:21:17.646
of an illustrated version
of Charlie, my Basset Hound

00:21:17.760 --> 00:21:19.626
and his short-legged plight.

00:21:20.030 --> 00:21:23.896
And how he thinks he's a cow
dog that he's really of no use

00:21:24.170 --> 00:21:26.570
to anybody except just comic relief.

00:21:26.610 --> 00:21:26.913
So, but the cookbook will probably
be sometime in the following year.

00:21:30.840 --> 00:21:34.440
So-- but as far as the wide
open spaces, I had to laugh

00:21:35.400 --> 00:21:39.866
because when I first arrived today,
the crowd was a little more thin

00:21:42.730 --> 00:21:45.930
and of course I thought
it was completely packed.

00:21:46.520 --> 00:21:46.726
And then the gal who's
showing me around said, "Well,

00:21:49.780 --> 00:21:50.380
like the crowds is
gonna get real heavy.

00:21:51.780 --> 00:21:53.713
It's really light right now."

00:21:53.780 --> 00:21:54.276
I had to laugh because, you know,
one other person is a big crowd

00:21:57.550 --> 00:22:02.216
in my daily life so you can imagine
what an unusual sight this is but--

00:22:03.560 --> 00:22:05.026
and I appreciate that.

00:22:05.560 --> 00:22:06.760
I think that's one thing that
does appeal to city dwellers

00:22:08.160 --> 00:22:11.693
about my blog is just a slice
of American life that is

00:22:13.350 --> 00:22:15.216
so isolated and undeveloped.

00:22:15.830 --> 00:22:16.830
So, thank you.

00:22:17.830 --> 00:22:18.830
&gt;&gt; Thank you.

00:22:19.830 --> 00:22:20.830
&gt;&gt; Yes.

00:22:21.830 --> 00:22:22.430
&gt;&gt; Hi. I'm a librarian
from Gulf Shores,

00:22:23.830 --> 00:22:25.896
Alabama came here primarily one
of the reasons was to see you.

00:22:25.830 --> 00:22:26.963
&gt;&gt; Oh, thank you.

00:22:27.830 --> 00:22:27.920
&gt;&gt; I wanna know how is Kitty
Kitty, still good, I hope.

00:22:31.340 --> 00:22:32.873
&gt;&gt; Kitty Kitty is good.

00:22:33.340 --> 00:22:33.406
She's-- she thinks she's a dog.

00:22:35.340 --> 00:22:36.430
&gt;&gt; Because we had a similar
situation with my friend

00:22:37.650 --> 00:22:37.920
from taking their Kitty Kitty to the
vet who went from Milo to being Sue.

00:22:42.180 --> 00:22:42.673
&gt;&gt; I have-- we have a
stray kitten and I blogged

00:22:44.820 --> 00:22:49.420
about this new darling little girl
kitten that we had and people said,

00:22:49.430 --> 00:22:50.020
"That's looks like a male"
and I insisted for a week

00:22:52.240 --> 00:22:56.240
that it was a female kitten and
it was in fact a male kitten.

00:22:56.240 --> 00:22:59.306
So, I had-- I talked
about embarrassing myself.

00:22:59.460 --> 00:22:59.630
&gt;&gt; But my real serious question
is, do you do all the content

00:23:03.290 --> 00:23:05.090
for your homeschooling tab?

00:23:05.290 --> 00:23:06.290
&gt;&gt; No.

00:23:07.290 --> 00:23:08.490
&gt;&gt; 'Cause sometimes when
I see things about games

00:23:09.290 --> 00:23:09.403
or learning tools, I wonder
if it's from other people.

00:23:12.710 --> 00:23:14.643
&gt;&gt; I have 2 contributors on--

00:23:14.710 --> 00:23:15.710
&gt;&gt; Thank you.

00:23:16.710 --> 00:23:18.643
&gt;&gt; The homeschooling section.

00:23:18.710 --> 00:23:20.243
The print is small but it
says at the top of the post,

00:23:20.710 --> 00:23:22.043
posted by Heather Sanders,
posted by Kristen Chase.

00:23:22.710 --> 00:23:23.310
&gt;&gt; I was interested
'cause we have a lot

00:23:24.710 --> 00:23:25.110
of homeschoolers come
to the library.

00:23:26.710 --> 00:23:27.710
&gt;&gt; Yeah.

00:23:28.710 --> 00:23:29.710
&gt;&gt; Great.

00:23:30.710 --> 00:23:32.710
&gt;&gt; I-- I'm quick to recognize
my own limitations and I notice

00:23:32.710 --> 00:23:34.776
that I had only been able to
post on the homeschooling section

00:23:34.710 --> 00:23:35.800
about once a week so I could either
homeschool my children and post

00:23:38.020 --> 00:23:39.753
on the homeschool section.

00:23:40.020 --> 00:23:41.020
&gt;&gt; Sure.

00:23:42.020 --> 00:23:43.553
&gt;&gt; So, I was happy to take
on some contributors there.

00:23:44.020 --> 00:23:45.020
&gt;&gt; Very good.

00:23:46.020 --> 00:23:47.020
&gt;&gt; Hi.

00:23:48.020 --> 00:23:48.420
&gt;&gt; Can you hear me--
ah there you go.

00:23:50.020 --> 00:23:51.420
So, most of single ladies
in the audience would love

00:23:52.020 --> 00:23:53.953
to know where cowboy Josh is?

00:23:54.020 --> 00:23:55.020
[ Laughter ]

00:23:56.020 --> 00:23:56.686
&gt;&gt; Cowboy Josh is like
the eye candy of--

00:23:58.020 --> 00:23:58.153
the single eye candy on my blog.

00:24:00.020 --> 00:24:01.086
He's our cowboy.

00:24:02.020 --> 00:24:03.553
He's still very single.

00:24:04.020 --> 00:24:04.883
Cowboy Josh wants children so
anyone who's not interested

00:24:06.890 --> 00:24:09.156
in having children need not apply.

00:24:09.200 --> 00:24:12.000
[Laughter] He would
even take the children.

00:24:12.410 --> 00:24:13.630
He says, "I'll take the children
first and then I'll find a woman,"

00:24:15.590 --> 00:24:18.790
and I'm like, "Josh, do
you know how this works?"

00:24:19.420 --> 00:24:21.353
[Laughter] So, but he's good.

00:24:21.760 --> 00:24:23.226
He's such a great guy.

00:24:23.760 --> 00:24:24.450
&gt;&gt; And my other question
was, in all of the chaos

00:24:26.270 --> 00:24:26.406
of what's become your
life here recently,

00:24:28.800 --> 00:24:29.133
how do you personally find balance.

00:24:30.800 --> 00:24:30.826
Is it through blogging or raising
your kids or what is it internally

00:24:35.240 --> 00:24:35.886
that you use to kinda stable
yourself and keep yourself grounded?

00:24:38.860 --> 00:24:40.593
&gt;&gt; That's a good question.

00:24:40.860 --> 00:24:40.913
Well, if you saw our
daily life on the ranch,

00:24:43.740 --> 00:24:44.273
you wouldn't need to
out that question.

00:24:45.740 --> 00:24:50.206
And the-- really the country is
what grounded me when I moved there.

00:24:51.710 --> 00:24:52.263
You know, I had lived in Los Angeles
and it was sort of a frenzy type

00:24:55.690 --> 00:24:59.490
of person and when I moved to
the country I really found--

00:24:59.960 --> 00:25:00.323
it sounds so cheesy to say,
I found my inner peace.

00:25:02.930 --> 00:25:07.596
But, you know I really found myself
in the country so I loved going out

00:25:07.650 --> 00:25:07.870
and going places that I
love going home the most.

00:25:10.630 --> 00:25:15.163
And our day, I mean-- you can't lose
your head when you have cow poop

00:25:16.020 --> 00:25:16.686
on your porch first
thing in the morning.

00:25:18.020 --> 00:25:19.313
And there's no one to clean
it up but me, you know.

00:25:20.060 --> 00:25:22.993
So, I found-- I find my
center in cow manure.

00:25:24.970 --> 00:25:26.236
Is what I'm saying.

00:25:26.970 --> 00:25:27.970
[Laughter] Yes.

00:25:28.970 --> 00:25:31.370
&gt;&gt; Hi. Thank you so much for coming.

00:25:31.780 --> 00:25:32.780
&gt;&gt; Thank you.

00:25:33.780 --> 00:25:35.180
&gt;&gt; I have a question.

00:25:35.780 --> 00:25:37.590
I work a little bit into IT and
so, your blog is always so polished

00:25:38.370 --> 00:25:39.586
and I know that you're busy with the
cattle ranch and the homeschooling

00:25:41.820 --> 00:25:42.153
and the photography and everything.

00:25:43.820 --> 00:25:45.656
How many-- do you-- how many-- do
you have any people helping you

00:25:46.250 --> 00:25:47.170
out with all the ad support
and the IT support like behind

00:25:49.130 --> 00:25:51.130
such a big site that you have?

00:25:51.130 --> 00:25:51.880
Like I know-- like how
many people do you have

00:25:53.380 --> 00:25:55.246
like working with you on it?

00:25:55.430 --> 00:25:59.830
&gt;&gt; Definitely, well when I started
my blog in 2006, I used Blogger.

00:26:00.120 --> 00:26:01.120
You know?

00:26:02.120 --> 00:26:03.120
&gt;&gt; Yeah.

00:26:04.120 --> 00:26:04.920
&gt;&gt; My address was
pioneerwoman.blogspot.com

00:26:06.120 --> 00:26:07.386
for about 6 months.

00:26:08.120 --> 00:26:09.986
And then I moved to TypePad.

00:26:10.120 --> 00:26:10.990
Those are both free online
blogging software platforms.

00:26:12.850 --> 00:26:14.783
So, I did it all myself then.

00:26:14.850 --> 00:26:15.183
And then Heather Sanders who is one

00:26:16.850 --> 00:26:17.466
of my homeschool contributors
now helped me designed a custom,

00:26:20.300 --> 00:26:21.300
WordPress site.

00:26:22.490 --> 00:26:22.623
But now, with my-- you might have
noticed, I redesigned my site

00:26:26.490 --> 00:26:26.556
in July, launched a redesigned.

00:26:28.490 --> 00:26:29.690
&gt;&gt; It looks great.

00:26:30.490 --> 00:26:31.623
&gt;&gt; Oh, thank you.

00:26:32.490 --> 00:26:32.956
It took a long time
because I-- some--

00:26:34.490 --> 00:26:34.556
I'm not meticulous in
any aspect of my life.

00:26:37.290 --> 00:26:40.623
You just have to look in
my closet to realize that.

00:26:41.120 --> 00:26:41.306
But with my site, I want
everything to be lined up and neat

00:26:44.800 --> 00:26:46.733
and I want it to be pleasant.

00:26:47.010 --> 00:26:50.610
But I have a team of-- not
a team, a guy and his friend

00:26:53.050 --> 00:26:53.586
that are really good with
back-end WordPress stuff

00:26:55.780 --> 00:26:58.580
and they pretty much
make sure it's secure.

00:26:58.910 --> 00:27:02.043
My site was hacked about
a year ago and it was--

00:27:03.380 --> 00:27:05.113
it was a nightmare for me.

00:27:05.380 --> 00:27:07.246
I just hated the idea of it.

00:27:07.380 --> 00:27:11.046
So, they make sure it's all
secure and working smoothly.

00:27:11.390 --> 00:27:12.390
Thank you.

00:27:14.950 --> 00:27:15.950
&gt;&gt; Thanks.

00:27:16.950 --> 00:27:17.950
[ Pause ]

00:27:18.950 --> 00:27:19.950
&gt;&gt; Hi.

00:27:20.950 --> 00:27:22.283
&gt;&gt; Hi. I don't read blogs,
so I don't know anything

00:27:22.950 --> 00:27:25.216
about your personal life except
what's in your wonderful cookbook

00:27:24.950 --> 00:27:26.683
which I enjoyed very much.

00:27:26.950 --> 00:27:27.950
&gt;&gt; Thank you.

00:27:28.950 --> 00:27:30.350
&gt;&gt; Your recipes are so easy
to follow and delicious.

00:27:30.950 --> 00:27:31.950
&gt;&gt; Thank you.

00:27:32.950 --> 00:27:33.616
&gt;&gt; And, can just say
a little bit about--

00:27:34.950 --> 00:27:37.083
you mentioned in the cookbook
about the mustangs and the horses

00:27:36.950 --> 00:27:38.750
that you have in the ranch.

00:27:38.950 --> 00:27:40.216
And where did they came
from and are they rescues?

00:27:40.950 --> 00:27:42.550
&gt;&gt; Yes, we have-- we actually
are a family cattle ranch

00:27:42.950 --> 00:27:43.883
and have always had just
cattle on the ranch.

00:27:44.950 --> 00:27:48.616
We have a Cow/Calf Operation
and we also have yearlings.

00:27:48.740 --> 00:27:49.953
And you know, not that I even
know what really that means

00:27:51.260 --> 00:27:51.890
but I've heard my husband say
that we have cows on the ranch.

00:27:54.630 --> 00:27:57.563
But in '03, we applied
for a contract to take

00:28:02.160 --> 00:28:03.826
in sanctuary wild horses.

00:28:04.690 --> 00:28:05.300
And it's through the Bureau
of Land Management, Wild Horse

00:28:07.880 --> 00:28:11.213
and Burros Program, they're
overpopulated back west

00:28:12.080 --> 00:28:15.613
and so they find landowners
who can take care of them.

00:28:15.640 --> 00:28:18.973
And they-- so, we have a
ranch full of wild horses.

00:28:19.380 --> 00:28:19.420
[Laughter] It's really wonderful.

00:28:21.540 --> 00:28:23.606
We feed them in the winter time

00:28:24.120 --> 00:28:24.840
but we just let them roam
free the rest of the year.

00:28:26.800 --> 00:28:28.533
And they are wild animals.

00:28:29.850 --> 00:28:30.250
You don't wanna make
one of them mad.

00:28:31.850 --> 00:28:33.383
&gt;&gt; Thank you very much.

00:28:33.850 --> 00:28:34.250
That's a great addition
to your book.

00:28:35.850 --> 00:28:36.183
&gt;&gt; It's kinda been a fun diversion.

00:28:37.850 --> 00:28:38.850
&gt;&gt; Hi.

00:28:39.850 --> 00:28:40.850
&gt;&gt; Hi.

00:28:41.850 --> 00:28:44.516
&gt;&gt; Actually, I'm from Wyoming so I
understand the big wide open spaces,

00:28:43.850 --> 00:28:44.783
but I wanted to ask you
about your Photoshop.

00:28:45.850 --> 00:28:46.533
How do you-- did you have take
classes or training or how do you--

00:28:49.500 --> 00:28:50.356
you have great Photoshop,
the actions and everything?

00:28:52.110 --> 00:28:54.110
How did you come up with that?

00:28:54.110 --> 00:28:55.243
&gt;&gt; Oh, thank you.

00:28:56.110 --> 00:28:56.263
I bought my first camera 2
weeks after I started my blog.

00:28:59.690 --> 00:29:04.290
I knew nothing about photography and
I took one lesson, private lesson

00:29:04.410 --> 00:29:05.676
to kinda-- I don't even
know what an aperture was.

00:29:06.410 --> 00:29:06.493
So, I've-- so I was
starting from scratch.

00:29:09.060 --> 00:29:09.063
But I taught myself photography.

00:29:11.190 --> 00:29:11.906
I posted a lot of really bad
pictures, took a lot of bad pictures

00:29:14.740 --> 00:29:15.353
but you just learn as someone--
it's the same with blogging,

00:29:18.060 --> 00:29:18.910
if you wanna learn photography
just take pictures everyday

00:29:21.010 --> 00:29:22.476
and that's what I did.

00:29:23.010 --> 00:29:23.646
And really, she's-- we got an
over time card going here so.

00:29:26.240 --> 00:29:30.506
But, what I'm trying to impart
more than anything through my site

00:29:31.050 --> 00:29:31.073
or through my cookbook
or even through my memoir

00:29:34.160 --> 00:29:34.536
and I'll tell you why in a
second, is If I can do it,

00:29:37.250 --> 00:29:39.650
you can do it whether it is cooking,

00:29:39.670 --> 00:29:43.070
because cooking is not
rocket science or photography

00:29:44.030 --> 00:29:48.696
or finding contentment in the middle
of nowhere which I was able to do.

00:29:49.730 --> 00:29:50.360
So that's really what I'm trying
to pass on and I just wanted

00:29:53.100 --> 00:29:54.636
to thank you all for being
here and your great questions

00:29:55.230 --> 00:29:56.963
and it's great to see you.

00:29:57.230 --> 00:29:58.460
Thank you.

00:29:57.000 --> 00:29:58.000


00:29:59.730 --> 00:30:00.730
[ Applause]

00:30:03.230 --> 00:30:03.236
