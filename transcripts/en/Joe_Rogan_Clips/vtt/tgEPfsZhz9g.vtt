1
00:00:00.120 --> 00:00:03.180
Absolutely,
yeah,
there,
there's definitely something there is,
you know,

2
00:00:03.181 --> 00:00:03.931
especially if you're,

3
00:00:03.931 --> 00:00:06.420
you're in competitive sports or something like that where you just,

4
00:00:06.630 --> 00:00:08.950
there's nothing you hate more than losing.
Right.
Good.

5
00:00:08.951 --> 00:00:10.880
Because otherwise you won't work as hard.
Yeah.

6
00:00:10.910 --> 00:00:12.810
But Jamie was talking about Kobe Bryan by what?

7
00:00:12.811 --> 00:00:14.370
A psycho he was when he was training.

8
00:00:14.670 --> 00:00:16.560
And they always say that about Michael Jordan.

9
00:00:16.561 --> 00:00:20.040
And of course Mike Tyson was like that.
Coby said he learned it from Michael.

10
00:00:20.041 --> 00:00:24.560
That's like what he passed on.
Kobe.
Pass it on to Lebron.
Yeah.

11
00:00:24.570 --> 00:00:25.750
They went on the Olympic team together.

12
00:00:25.770 --> 00:00:30.770
I heard Lebron spends one point $5 million a year on recovery because recovery

13
00:00:31.810 --> 00:00:35.280
just recovery.
Just like Cryo therapy.
Massage.

14
00:00:35.920 --> 00:00:38.770
A million and a half every year.
Yeah.
Yeah.

15
00:00:39.240 --> 00:00:43.420
What a fucking stud here.
Dh.
Dh.
Jesus Christ,
that guy.

16
00:00:43.421 --> 00:00:46.380
So bad ass,
like maximizing everything.

17
00:00:46.720 --> 00:00:50.910
It's like a perfect example of someone was Maxima Freak.
Genetics.

18
00:00:51.210 --> 00:00:56.160
Powerful.
We'll intelligence.
But then on top of that,
maximizing everything,

19
00:00:56.540 --> 00:01:00.420
built a school has a good sense of humor about himself.
Decent actor,

20
00:01:01.170 --> 00:01:05.910
you know?
Yeah.
He was so funny in,
um,
uh,
was it?

21
00:01:06.150 --> 00:01:11.130
No,
it wasn't wrecked.
The Amy Schumer movie,
trainwreck as half,
right?
Yeah.

22
00:01:11.700 --> 00:01:15.090
Did you ever see that HBO show where they're sitting around with them?

23
00:01:15.120 --> 00:01:18.720
You may never shop.
Yes.
Yeah.
He's fucking great in that.

24
00:01:18.750 --> 00:01:21.930
And you get that insight.
It's like,
oh,
that's why you're so good.

25
00:01:21.931 --> 00:01:23.160
You're fucking crazy.

26
00:01:23.161 --> 00:01:26.640
Like he was talking about his son playing and he's talking about his mom and

27
00:01:26.641 --> 00:01:31.560
like he's just his,
his drive and you know,
he doesn't,
he doesn't let anything go.

28
00:01:31.620 --> 00:01:34.080
It's fascinating to me.
Yeah.
The people like that,

29
00:01:34.081 --> 00:01:38.670
that are like extreme winters are there.
There's such a rare person,
you know,

30
00:01:38.760 --> 00:01:42.420
and it's,
and it's rare that you could probably stand to be around that.
Yeah.

31
00:01:42.421 --> 00:01:44.790
That's,
you know,
especially like your,
your kind of your,

32
00:01:44.940 --> 00:01:48.570
your tech billionaires or stuff like that.
It's like,
after a while you'd be like,

33
00:01:48.600 --> 00:01:52.760
you know,
I'm,
I'm going to go to the comedy store and,
and we're going to,
yeah.

34
00:01:52.800 --> 00:01:55.810
Break each other's balls for awhile because this is weird,
man.
Right.

35
00:01:55.850 --> 00:02:00.840
Like Steve Jobs,
like known by everyone as a extreme cont yeah,

36
00:02:01.280 --> 00:02:04.500
right.
He was just a cut.
There's no way around it.
Yeah.
Brutal.

37
00:02:04.710 --> 00:02:08.700
Do you remember that video?
There's a video.
It's a,
he's demonstrating a,

38
00:02:08.701 --> 00:02:11.820
an apple product and he can't get this camera to work and he's pressing on these

39
00:02:11.821 --> 00:02:12.660
buttons.
It doesn't work.

40
00:02:12.810 --> 00:02:17.460
And he throws it at the engineer with this like pursed lips.

41
00:02:17.520 --> 00:02:21.160
Aha.
He's like,
here,
you fix it.
See if you can get it to work.
Yeah.

42
00:02:21.210 --> 00:02:23.310
Like just wants you fucking Loeser.

43
00:02:23.320 --> 00:02:25.890
I'm in front of a million pay pal and he can't,

44
00:02:26.090 --> 00:02:30.090
he can't lose his mind because it's like that Japanese ethic of the person who

45
00:02:30.091 --> 00:02:32.800
loses their temper first loses no matter who's right or wrong.

46
00:02:32.830 --> 00:02:36.360
I'm sure he loses his temper privately.
Oh,
without a doubt that guys.
Yeah,

47
00:02:36.361 --> 00:02:38.880
there it is.
Watch this.
It's like you can't get it to work.

48
00:02:40.280 --> 00:02:42.660
Like my camera's not turn it on.

49
00:02:44.270 --> 00:02:47.520
<v 1>What's that?
I did slide it in like,
Yo</v>

50
00:02:50.150 --> 00:02:54.550
<v 0>angry.
Not turn it on.
What's asleep?
Okay,</v>

51
00:02:56.840 --> 00:02:59.990
please like this fucking,
he's fucking Turner.
