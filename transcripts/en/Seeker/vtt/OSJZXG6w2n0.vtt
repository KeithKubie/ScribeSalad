00:00:00.099 --> 00:00:04.430
Just a warning, what I am about to talk about
is sensitive and may be potentially distressing

00:00:04.430 --> 00:00:12.440
for some viewers.

00:00:12.440 --> 00:00:15.610
Crime shows give Americans a skewed view of
the justice system.

00:00:15.610 --> 00:00:19.539
For the most heinous of crimes, evidence abounds
and the bad guy is always caught.

00:00:19.539 --> 00:00:23.320
Yet thousands of victims of sexual assault,
never get their TV ending.

00:00:23.320 --> 00:00:28.050
Right now, States across the country keep
hundreds of thousands of untested rape kits

00:00:28.050 --> 00:00:29.050
in storage.

00:00:29.050 --> 00:00:31.199
Detroit is the most notorious city of late.

00:00:31.199 --> 00:00:35.519
Five years ago, 11,000 untested kits were
discovered in a warehouse.

00:00:35.519 --> 00:00:36.974
Since then, only a fraction of those, 2,000
have been tested.

00:00:36.974 --> 00:00:37.974
On average more than half of the kits in storage
contain biological evidence, like hair or

00:00:37.974 --> 00:00:38.974
blood that did not belong to the victim.

00:00:38.974 --> 00:00:42.429
Authorities in Detroit are trying to raise
ten million dollars to process and prosecute

00:00:42.429 --> 00:00:44.090
the rest of their backlogged rape kits.

00:00:44.090 --> 00:00:47.090
So what is a rape kit?

00:00:47.090 --> 00:00:52.100
A rape kit is a forensic tool to collect and
preserve DNA and other physical evidence after

00:00:52.100 --> 00:00:53.100
a sexual assault.

00:00:53.100 --> 00:00:56.870
In different cities it goes by different names,
in Washington DC they’re called a Physical

00:00:56.870 --> 00:01:01.949
Evidence Recovery Kit," or PERK. in other
cities its called Sexual assault forensic

00:01:01.949 --> 00:01:03.449
evidence or (SAFE) kit.

00:01:03.449 --> 00:01:06.619
No matter what they’re called they contain
the same basic tools.

00:01:06.619 --> 00:01:11.229
A kit can contain a blood sample from the
victim, swabs to collect bodily fluids, a

00:01:11.229 --> 00:01:15.411
comb to collect hair and fiber from clothing,
a nail pick to get any evidence from under

00:01:15.411 --> 00:01:18.329
the nail
and storage boxes, bags, and or slides to

00:01:18.329 --> 00:01:19.329
preserve them.

00:01:19.329 --> 00:01:23.579
There’s usually bigger bags to collect some
clothing or material from the victim and up

00:01:23.579 --> 00:01:25.799
to 15 envelopes to store the evidence.

00:01:25.799 --> 00:01:29.679
The collection is part of a hospital exam
and should be done within 98 hours of the

00:01:29.679 --> 00:01:30.679
assault.

00:01:30.679 --> 00:01:34.159
The collection is done by a trained member
of sexual assault response team in a private,

00:01:34.159 --> 00:01:35.399
secluded part of the hospital.

00:01:35.399 --> 00:01:40.250
An exam is performed after a victims gives
written consent and a thorough medical history.

00:01:40.250 --> 00:01:44.359
Starting with less invasive collection, swabbing
the mouth and getting underneath the fingernails,

00:01:44.359 --> 00:01:48.920
then collecting hair and fiber samples, moving
on to more invasive collection, photographing

00:01:48.920 --> 00:01:53.590
any injuries and swabbing the gentitalia and
anal area which can be very emotionally trying

00:01:53.590 --> 00:01:54.590
to a victim.

00:01:54.590 --> 00:01:58.530
During the exam a doctor can test for sexual
transmitted infections as well as provide

00:01:58.530 --> 00:02:00.130
emergency contraception.

00:02:00.130 --> 00:02:02.320
The whole process can take a few hours.

00:02:02.320 --> 00:02:05.310
While difficult, collecting the evidence is
worth it.

00:02:05.310 --> 00:02:10.550
Rape kits can confirm a victims report, identify
an unknown perpetrator or identify a serial

00:02:10.550 --> 00:02:13.140
offender, and even clear innocent suspects.

00:02:13.140 --> 00:02:17.690
But for thousands of kits to go untested is
more than just shameful, it’s a huge disservice

00:02:17.690 --> 00:02:19.950
to victims of sexual assault everywhere.

00:02:19.950 --> 00:02:24.070
Small police budgets and a false belief that
testing was only beneficial in cases where

00:02:24.070 --> 00:02:26.980
the rapist was stranger kept kits on the shelf.

00:02:26.980 --> 00:02:31.230
But there is hope, many cities across the
nation are racing to get rape kits out of

00:02:31.230 --> 00:02:32.600
storage and processed.

00:02:32.600 --> 00:02:37.230
For example, in San Francisco, a kit must
be sent to a crime lab within 72 hours of

00:02:37.230 --> 00:02:41.030
collection and information uploaded to a National
Database within two weeks.

00:02:41.030 --> 00:02:45.850
And across the country other states implemented
legislation to reform the process of their

00:02:45.850 --> 00:02:46.850
kits.

00:02:46.850 --> 00:02:50.650
