00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.000
Before we can answer the question of what the earth's circumference is,

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:06.000
we need to start thinking about what the shape of the earth is.

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:09.000
Now, our earth is a sphere.

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:12.000
When we draw this sphere we often include lines of latitude,

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:17.000
which go from east to west, and the center line of latitude, which occurs at 0 degrees.

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:19.000
We call it the equator.

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:24.000
We also draw lines on longitude, which go from north to south

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:26.000
and are all of equal length.

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:30.000
Now, it's a common misconception that the ancient Greeks thought the earth was flat,

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:33.000
but this was simply not the case.

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:35.000
The ancient Greeks knew the earth was spherical,

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:38.000
or at least they had good reason to believe it was.

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:40.000
Let's start thinking about geometry by cataloging

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:43.000
some of the evidence the Greeks had available to them

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:46.000
and deciding which pointed towards a spherical earth.

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:49.000
First, the Greeks knew that the earth casts a circular shadow on the moon

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:51.000
during a lunar eclipse.

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:56.000
A lunar eclipse occurs when the earth gets between the sun and the moon,

00:00:56.000 --> 00:01:00.000
and the earth casts a shadow on the moon.

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:02.000
The Greeks also knew that when traveling at sea,

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:08.000
you can see farther--a greater distance--from the top of the mast than from the deck of the ship.

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:13.000
That's why when you look at old ships, you often see a crow's nest high up on the mast

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:17.000
where a spotter could look for land.

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:22.000
Third, the Greeks knew that the moon and the sun appeared as disks in the sky.

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:28.000
Finally, the Greeks also knew that the sun appears lower in the sky as you travel north.

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:32.000
Now, this only applies for someone living in the Northern Hemisphere,

00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:34.000
but that's where the Greeks lived.

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:37.000
Now, if we want to distinguish between a spherical earth and a disk-shaped earth,

00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:40.000
we have to use our evidence.

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:43.000
Now, this is the evidence that was available to the Greeks,

00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:48.000
so I want you to think through each of these four points and decide for each one

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:52.000
whether it best supports the idea that the earth is a sphere,

00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:58.000
that the earth is a disk, or maybe it supports both or neither of these.

00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:02.000
Go ahead and select one button for each of these four points.

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:05.000
Now, this is a tricky quiz, and some of these you could actually debate the answer.

00:02:05.000 --> 99:59:59.000
So, don't worry if you don't get it right on the first try.
