00:00:00.512 --> 00:00:01.812
- In this video, we're going to talk about

00:00:01.812 --> 00:00:06.564
box-and-whisker diagrams.

00:00:09.933 --> 00:00:12.725
And these are actually quite common.

00:00:12.725 --> 00:00:13.864
Box-and-whisker diagrams.

00:00:13.864 --> 00:00:17.418
Especially if you ever
do any stock trading.

00:00:17.418 --> 00:00:20.913
If you go to most stock chart providers,

00:00:23.205 --> 00:00:25.870
a box-and-whisker diagram is
usually one of the options.

00:00:25.870 --> 00:00:28.280
So let's understand how to generate one

00:00:28.280 --> 00:00:30.149
and essentially how to read one using

00:00:30.149 --> 00:00:32.323
just some data that we have up here.

00:00:32.323 --> 00:00:34.253
So the first thing we
want to do is order it

00:00:34.253 --> 00:00:36.793
because it we're going to
be finding a lot of medians

00:00:36.793 --> 00:00:39.190
when we want to generate
our box-and-whisker diagram.

00:00:39.190 --> 00:00:41.831
So let's just order the numbers up here.

00:00:41.831 --> 00:00:45.001
So let's see, it looks
like the lowest number here

00:00:45.001 --> 00:00:49.125
is 49...so I have that 49.

00:00:49.125 --> 00:00:52.274
Then I have another 49 right here,

00:00:52.274 --> 00:00:57.274
then I have another 49 right over there,

00:00:58.227 --> 00:01:00.828
and then do I have any 50s?

00:01:00.828 --> 00:01:02.637
Yes, I have two 50s.

00:01:02.637 --> 00:01:04.282
One, two 50s.

00:01:04.282 --> 00:01:07.918
I have two 50s...one, two...

00:01:07.918 --> 00:01:09.178
Do I have any 51s?

00:01:09.178 --> 00:01:12.408
I have one 51 as far as I can tell.

00:01:12.408 --> 00:01:14.359
So one 51.

00:01:14.359 --> 00:01:16.045
Do I have a 52?

00:01:16.045 --> 00:01:18.860
52? One 52.

00:01:19.352 --> 00:01:21.023
I have a 52...a 53?

00:01:21.023 --> 00:01:24.417
I have one 53...two 53s.

00:01:24.417 --> 00:01:29.417
53 and 53, 54...there's one.

00:01:30.125 --> 00:01:33.437
54...I don't have any other ones.

00:01:33.437 --> 00:01:36.870
55, I don't see one 55 here.

00:01:36.870 --> 00:01:40.641
56? I see a 56 right there.

00:01:42.025 --> 00:01:46.257
56, and then 57. I have
two--three of them.

00:01:46.257 --> 00:01:49.264
One, two, three.

00:01:49.264 --> 00:01:54.099
One, two, three 57s.

00:01:54.099 --> 00:01:56.192
And I've got a 58.

00:01:56.699 --> 00:02:00.658
A 58, a 59...

00:02:00.947 --> 00:02:03.325
a 59--let me scroll over a little bit.

00:02:03.325 --> 00:02:06.433
And then I have a 67 and I'm done,

00:02:06.785 --> 00:02:08.511
I've ordered all of these numbers

00:02:08.511 --> 00:02:11.843
and now it's a lot easier
to find the median.

00:02:11.843 --> 00:02:14.240
Now, the median as you
may or may not remember

00:02:14.240 --> 00:02:16.129
is the middle of these numbers.

00:02:16.129 --> 00:02:17.876
So how many total numbers do we have?

00:02:18.676 --> 00:02:21.635
We have one, two, three, four, five, six,

00:02:21.635 --> 00:02:24.766
seven, eight, nine, ten,
eleven, twelve, thirteen,

00:02:24.766 --> 00:02:28.931
fourteen, fifteen,
sixteen, seventeen numbers.

00:02:28.931 --> 00:02:31.654
So the middle number, if
you have seventeen numbers,

00:02:31.654 --> 00:02:33.056
there's two way to think about it:

00:02:33.056 --> 00:02:36.389
however many numbers you
have, we have seventeen,

00:02:36.389 --> 00:02:40.776
you add 1 to 17 and you divide by 2

00:02:40.776 --> 00:02:42.361
and you count that many spaces from

00:02:42.361 --> 00:02:44.922
either the left or the right-hand side

00:02:44.922 --> 00:02:46.993
and you will get the middle number.

00:02:46.993 --> 00:02:48.781
So this is eighteen divided by 2

00:02:48.781 --> 00:02:50.509
which is equaled to 9.

00:02:50.509 --> 00:02:53.049
So one, two, three, four, five, six,

00:02:53.049 --> 00:02:56.339
seven, eight, nine, 53.

00:02:56.339 --> 00:02:57.986
Should work from this side as well.

00:02:57.986 --> 00:03:00.727
One, two, three, four, five, six,

00:03:00.727 --> 00:03:04.384
seven, eight, nine, you got 53.

00:03:04.384 --> 00:03:06.071
And if you ever have a
situation where it's like

00:03:06.071 --> 00:03:08.448
let's say you only have sixteen numbers

00:03:08.448 --> 00:03:10.520
and it would be sixteen
plus one divided by 2

00:03:10.520 --> 00:03:11.861
you get eight and a half?

00:03:11.861 --> 00:03:15.112
That means count eight
spaces and then go halfway

00:03:15.112 --> 00:03:17.693
between that number and the
number right after that.

00:03:17.693 --> 00:03:19.785
Which we saw that in
a few diagrams before.

00:03:19.785 --> 00:03:22.710
But anyway, 53 is the median.

00:03:22.710 --> 00:03:26.266
53 right here is the median.

00:03:27.696 --> 00:03:29.274
Now, the next thing we want to do

00:03:29.274 --> 00:03:32.219
when we want to generate
a box-and-whisker diagram

00:03:32.219 --> 00:03:35.571
is figure out the median of the two halves

00:03:35.571 --> 00:03:38.578
of the data, notice, if you pick 53,

00:03:38.578 --> 00:03:41.931
as kind of dividing line,
half the data is above it,

00:03:41.931 --> 00:03:43.799
half the data is below it.

00:03:43.799 --> 00:03:46.562
If someone, if, you know,
these are people's ages

00:03:46.562 --> 00:03:49.468
and they say they're 53,
they're the 50th percentile.

00:03:49.468 --> 00:03:54.100
50 percent of the people
are above their age

00:03:54.100 --> 00:03:57.066
50 percent of the people are below it.

00:03:57.066 --> 00:03:58.651
This is the middle number.

00:03:58.651 --> 00:04:01.658
What we want to do now is find
the middles of the middle.

00:04:01.658 --> 00:04:05.783
Or find essentially what is the
25th and the 75th percentile

00:04:05.783 --> 00:04:08.545
So what's the number where only one-fourth

00:04:08.545 --> 00:04:10.455
of the numbers are less than that?

00:04:10.455 --> 00:04:12.832
And there's actually a
little ambiguity here.

00:04:12.832 --> 00:04:15.149
So if I want to find the middle of this

00:04:15.149 --> 00:04:17.180
left-hand portion right here,

00:04:17.180 --> 00:04:20.512
it's debatable whether I want to include

00:04:20.512 --> 00:04:22.341
this median right here.

00:04:22.341 --> 00:04:24.941
And actually both of those are valid ways

00:04:24.941 --> 00:04:27.400
of generating box-and-whisker diagrams.

00:04:27.400 --> 00:04:29.858
The typical algorithm,
an algorithm is just

00:04:29.858 --> 00:04:32.804
a way, a process for doing things,

00:04:32.804 --> 00:04:36.441
is to include this
median in the bottom list

00:04:36.441 --> 00:04:40.240
and to include this
median in the top list.

00:04:40.240 --> 00:04:43.389
So let's find the median
of this list right here.

00:04:43.389 --> 00:04:46.538
So we have one, two, three, four,

00:04:46.538 --> 00:04:50.826
five, six, seven, eight, nine numbers.

00:04:51.979 --> 00:04:56.979
9 + 1 over 2 is equal to
10 over 2 is equal to 5.

00:04:57.155 --> 00:05:01.076
So we count one, two, three, four, five.

00:05:01.076 --> 00:05:04.936
Right there, that is the
median of this bottom list.

00:05:04.936 --> 00:05:07.638
And we actually call this, right here,

00:05:07.638 --> 00:05:11.231
we call this the first quartile,

00:05:11.231 --> 00:05:13.837
we call this the 1st.

00:05:13.837 --> 00:05:18.837
This number right here
is the 1st Quartile.

00:05:19.121 --> 00:05:21.406
And what it does is it separates its--

00:05:21.406 --> 00:05:23.155
there's a bunch of ways you could view it.

00:05:23.155 --> 00:05:27.034
You could say that all,
that twenty-five percent

00:05:27.034 --> 00:05:30.569
or one-fourth, that's where
the word quartile comes from,

00:05:30.569 --> 00:05:34.044
you have one-fourth of the
values are below this number.

00:05:34.044 --> 00:05:37.010
Or you could say
three-fourths of the values

00:05:37.010 --> 00:05:38.534
are above this number.

00:05:38.534 --> 00:05:41.642
Now the other way to do a
box-and-whisker diagram,

00:05:41.642 --> 00:05:43.674
is you don't include this median,

00:05:43.674 --> 00:05:45.523
but I think you would've
gotten the same answer.

00:05:45.523 --> 00:05:46.721
But if you did include this median,

00:05:46.721 --> 00:05:48.712
you'd have one, two, three, four, five,

00:05:48.712 --> 00:05:50.776
six, seven, eight values...

00:05:50.776 --> 00:05:54.311
8 + 1 divided by 2 is 4.5

00:05:54.311 --> 00:05:57.074
so you'd go one, two,
three, four and a half.

00:05:57.074 --> 00:05:59.431
So you go halfway between these two 50s,

00:05:59.431 --> 00:06:01.301
but you would still get 50.

00:06:01.301 --> 00:06:03.657
That's the number that's
between a 50 and a 50, is a 50.

00:06:03.657 --> 00:06:06.400
So either way our 1st Quartile
number wouldn't be different.

00:06:06.400 --> 00:06:09.061
Now, the second quartile is the median.

00:06:09.061 --> 00:06:13.343
This is the 2nd Quartile.

00:06:14.223 --> 00:06:15.684
I always imagined you have twenty-five,

00:06:15.684 --> 00:06:18.083
this is twenty-five
percent of the numbers,

00:06:18.083 --> 00:06:23.083
25% or 1/4 of the number,
is the 1st Quartile.

00:06:23.364 --> 00:06:26.392
Or it's the first section
fourth of the numbers

00:06:26.392 --> 00:06:29.073
and it's upper bound is the 1st Quartile.

00:06:29.073 --> 00:06:32.649
Then you have this
one-fourth of the numbers.

00:06:32.649 --> 00:06:35.595
This is also 25% of the total numbers

00:06:35.595 --> 00:06:39.553
but it's upper bound is the 2nd Quartile

00:06:39.553 --> 00:06:41.869
or it's the median, this is from the

00:06:41.869 --> 00:06:44.165
25th to the 50th percentile.

00:06:44.165 --> 00:06:46.847
And then if we want to go from 50th...

00:06:46.847 --> 00:06:50.905
So this is 25th percentile,

00:06:50.905 --> 00:06:52.855
this is 50th percentile,

00:06:52.855 --> 00:06:55.171
which means that 50% of
the values are below it.

00:06:55.171 --> 00:06:57.304
This means 25% of the values are below it.

00:06:57.304 --> 00:06:59.742
And then if we want the 75th percentile,

00:06:59.742 --> 00:07:02.465
we find the median of
these values over here.

00:07:02.465 --> 00:07:04.334
And we'll include this median right there.

00:07:04.334 --> 00:07:06.610
So once again we have
one, two, three, four,

00:07:06.610 --> 00:07:09.657
five, six, seven, eight, nine values.

00:07:09.657 --> 00:07:11.872
9 + 1 over 2 is 5.

00:07:11.872 --> 00:07:14.269
So you go one, two, three, four, five.

00:07:14.269 --> 00:07:19.226
So the median of this higher
half of our data is 57.

00:07:19.226 --> 00:07:22.823
So this right here, this
number right there, the 57...

00:07:25.361 --> 00:07:29.690
The 57, we call that our 3rd Quartile.

00:07:30.490 --> 00:07:33.542
Our 3rd Quartile and it
represents the upper bound

00:07:33.542 --> 00:07:36.173
on the section from our 50th percentile

00:07:36.173 --> 00:07:37.981
to 75th percentile.

00:07:37.981 --> 00:07:40.663
So that's 25% of our numbers there.

00:07:40.663 --> 00:07:42.573
You can imagine that's what's
called the 3rd Quartile.

00:07:42.573 --> 00:07:45.884
One quartile, two
quartiles, three quartiles,

00:07:45.884 --> 00:07:48.485
and of course, the
number 57, you would say

00:07:48.485 --> 00:07:50.679
it's in the 75th percentile.

00:07:50.679 --> 00:07:54.825
75th percentile,

00:07:54.825 --> 00:07:58.056
which means that 75 percent of numbers

00:07:58.056 --> 00:08:00.087
where it is the 75th percentile,

00:08:00.087 --> 00:08:03.562
75 percent of numbers are below it.

00:08:03.562 --> 00:08:04.781
And if you count these, you would see

00:08:04.781 --> 00:08:06.833
that's indeed the case.

00:08:06.833 --> 00:08:09.921
Anyway, so we've been able to classify

00:08:09.921 --> 00:08:11.485
some interesting numbers, here.

00:08:11.485 --> 00:08:13.639
Let's actually plot it, now,

00:08:13.639 --> 00:08:17.072
using a box-and-whisker diagram.

00:08:18.056 --> 00:08:19.429
So what I'm going to do here..

00:08:19.429 --> 00:08:22.517
let me draw my x-axis just like that.

00:08:22.517 --> 00:08:24.102
It doesn't have to be
horizontal like this,

00:08:24.102 --> 00:08:25.443
it could be in any form.

00:08:25.443 --> 00:08:28.612
So let's say that this right here is 0.

00:08:28.612 --> 00:08:32.696
That's 0, that right there is 100,

00:08:32.696 --> 00:08:35.378
halfway between 0 and 100,
I'm just making a scale,

00:08:35.378 --> 00:08:39.726
right here is 50, this
right here would be 75.

00:08:39.726 --> 00:08:41.432
Now, what I'm doing has nothing--

00:08:41.432 --> 00:08:43.058
well I want to include these numbers

00:08:43.058 --> 00:08:44.442
but I'm just trying to make a nice scale

00:08:44.442 --> 00:08:47.173
to measure by--this is 25.

00:08:47.173 --> 00:08:51.867
And so let's draw this data
using a box-and-whisker diagram.

00:08:51.867 --> 00:08:54.711
So the median is 53.

00:08:54.711 --> 00:08:58.429
So the median is 53, maybe 53
is sitting right about there.

00:08:58.429 --> 00:09:00.217
Right, that's right about 53.

00:09:00.217 --> 00:09:01.538
That's our median.

00:09:01.538 --> 00:09:05.763
Our 1st Quartile is 50,
so 50 is right above--

00:09:05.763 --> 00:09:07.795
right there, actually.

00:09:07.795 --> 00:09:11.870
Our 3rd Quartile is 57,

00:09:11.870 --> 00:09:14.978
so 57 might sit right around here.

00:09:14.978 --> 00:09:17.782
I might want to scale this
a little bit differently.

00:09:17.782 --> 00:09:19.692
And I'm going to draw a box here.

00:09:19.692 --> 00:09:21.805
I'm going to draw a box here.

00:09:21.805 --> 00:09:24.162
So this right there, that is 53,

00:09:24.162 --> 00:09:28.245
that right there is 57, that's 57,

00:09:28.245 --> 00:09:30.765
and that right there is 50.

00:09:30.765 --> 00:09:32.878
So what I'm essentially
doing is representing

00:09:32.878 --> 00:09:36.413
the middle 50 percent of
the data is in this box.

00:09:36.413 --> 00:09:39.704
And this line represents
the actual median.

00:09:39.704 --> 00:09:43.178
Now, it's called a box-and-whisker diagram

00:09:43.178 --> 00:09:44.702
and I've only drawn a box.

00:09:44.702 --> 00:09:47.851
Let me draw the whisker or the whiskers.

00:09:47.851 --> 00:09:49.477
The whiskers essentially show us

00:09:49.477 --> 00:09:52.382
the entire range of data,
so the lowest data point

00:09:52.382 --> 00:09:55.856
is 49, which is right over here.

00:09:55.856 --> 00:09:57.786
I should zoom in on this a little bit.

00:09:57.786 --> 00:10:02.195
Highest data point is 67, which
is maybe right over there.

00:10:02.195 --> 00:10:04.410
So we draw whiskers.

00:10:04.410 --> 00:10:07.478
So what a box-and-whisker
diagram is showing us,

00:10:07.478 --> 00:10:09.753
it says, okay, most of
the data is sitting inside

00:10:09.753 --> 00:10:12.780
of the box, 50 percent of
the data, this 25 percent

00:10:12.780 --> 00:10:15.848
and this 25 percent is within this box

00:10:15.848 --> 00:10:18.042
but just to get an idea
of the range of the data

00:10:18.042 --> 00:10:19.871
it shows whiskers to show the low point

00:10:19.871 --> 00:10:22.289
all the way to the high point.

00:10:22.289 --> 00:10:24.178
Now let me draw this one a little bit--

00:10:24.178 --> 00:10:26.657
Let me zoom in a little
bit because I realized that

00:10:26.657 --> 00:10:29.135
this is a little bit all squenched up.

00:10:30.581 --> 00:10:33.585
So let me draw it a little bit nicer.

00:10:33.585 --> 00:10:36.775
So let me change my scale a little bit.

00:10:36.775 --> 00:10:39.131
Let's say that this right here is

00:10:39.131 --> 00:10:42.321
let's say that this is...

00:10:42.321 --> 00:10:45.836
45, 46, 47, 48, 49, 50,

00:10:45.836 --> 00:10:48.518
51, 52, 53, 54, 55, 56,

00:10:48.518 --> 00:10:51.301
57, 58, 59, 60, 61, 62,

00:10:51.301 --> 00:10:54.634
63, 64, 65, 66, 67, 68

00:10:54.634 --> 00:10:57.235
so this right here is 67.

00:10:57.235 --> 00:11:02.235
46, 47, 48, 49, 50 that's 50 right there.

00:11:02.355 --> 00:11:04.407
So if we use this as our scale,

00:11:04.407 --> 00:11:06.724
I think it'll be a little
bit clearer what's going on

00:11:06.724 --> 00:11:09.239
with the box-and-whisker diagram.

00:11:09.239 --> 00:11:11.819
We have our median, our 2nd Quartile,

00:11:11.819 --> 00:11:14.887
our 2nd Quartile is
53, one, two, three, 53

00:11:14.887 --> 00:11:16.533
It's right here.

00:11:16.533 --> 00:11:19.052
53 is right there.

00:11:19.052 --> 00:11:21.328
Our 1st Quartile, the number that is

00:11:21.328 --> 00:11:25.046
greater than 25 percent
of the values is 50.

00:11:25.430 --> 00:11:28.764
It's 50 right there, that's that.

00:11:28.764 --> 00:11:30.308
Let me color code it.

00:11:30.308 --> 00:11:32.197
This number, right there,

00:11:32.197 --> 00:11:35.332
is this number, right there.

00:11:35.332 --> 00:11:38.145
This number, our 3rd Quartile,

00:11:38.145 --> 00:11:40.481
the number that is larger than

00:11:40.481 --> 00:11:43.041
75 percent of the values is 57.

00:11:43.041 --> 00:11:47.389
One, two, three, four, five,
six, seven, it is this value.

00:11:47.389 --> 00:11:52.001
Right here, the median,
just to be clear was 53,

00:11:52.001 --> 00:11:54.296
that is this value right here.

00:11:54.296 --> 00:11:56.369
So now we can draw our box.

00:11:56.369 --> 00:11:59.274
We can draw our box.

00:11:59.274 --> 00:12:02.322
The box is telling us is
that 50 percent of the values

00:12:02.322 --> 00:12:06.791
are between here and
here, between 50 and 57.

00:12:06.791 --> 00:12:08.417
And then we draw our whiskers to show

00:12:08.417 --> 00:12:10.509
the entire range of the values.

00:12:10.509 --> 00:12:13.963
So the highest value here is 67.

00:12:13.963 --> 00:12:15.365
The highest value here--

00:12:15.365 --> 00:12:18.291
let me do that in another color--is 67.

00:12:18.291 --> 00:12:22.901
Is 67, so draw a whisker
that goes all the way to 67.

00:12:22.901 --> 00:12:25.794
And then the lowest value here is 49.

00:12:25.794 --> 00:12:30.331
So we draw a whisker that goes to 49.

00:12:30.331 --> 00:12:32.952
So what you see when you
look at a box-and-whiskers--

00:12:32.952 --> 00:12:34.354
so let's say you didn't
even need to see this data,

00:12:34.354 --> 00:12:36.649
you just looked at this
box-and-whisker diagram

00:12:36.649 --> 00:12:37.564
you'd immediately say,

00:12:37.564 --> 00:12:40.228
"Okay, the middle number looks like 53,

00:12:41.458 --> 00:12:43.760
"most of the numbers are
50 percent, I should say,

00:12:43.760 --> 00:12:47.214
"the numbers are between 50 and 57,

00:12:47.214 --> 00:12:49.023
"so most of them are
squenched up over here

00:12:49.023 --> 00:12:51.847
"but the entire range
goes all the way to 67

00:12:51.847 --> 00:12:54.772
"but it doesn't go too
much below the 50th,

00:12:54.772 --> 00:12:58.409
"the inner quartile range,
or the range between

00:12:58.409 --> 00:13:03.001
"the 25th and 75th percentile."

00:13:03.001 --> 00:13:04.829
So hopefully that gives
you a good overview

00:13:04.829 --> 00:13:06.536
and now when you see
these in stock charts--

00:13:06.536 --> 00:13:08.649
although in stock charts,
you'll see these verticle

00:13:08.649 --> 00:13:10.315
as opposed to horizontal like that--

00:13:10.315 --> 00:13:11.737
you'll have a good understanding

00:13:11.737 --> 00:13:13.750
of what they're telling you.
