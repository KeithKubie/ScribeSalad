00:00:00.060 --> 00:00:02.620
Hey, what's up guys hang out today with Dennis roady?

00:00:02.620 --> 00:00:04.110
I have a channel called how to prank it up

00:00:04.110 --> 00:00:07.949
Where you go, and I teach you how to track you friends and family so he just flew in today

00:00:07.950 --> 00:00:12.719
And we've been thinking some ideas of how we can relate projects to pranks and we literally just count this idea

00:00:12.719 --> 00:00:18.749
What if we took a mousetrap and turn it into some kind of pressure activated switch like the perfect prank dude

00:00:18.750 --> 00:00:22.379
We run the story now grab some mousetraps and see what kind of we can  come up

00:00:22.380 --> 00:00:23.182
Let's go get to it

00:00:23.182 --> 00:00:25.500
alright guys, so we just found the gardening section

00:00:25.500 --> 00:00:27.220
This is where you get rid of rodents

00:00:27.220 --> 00:00:33.570
Little Tomcat brands kind of cool cause they got like the little cheddar cheddar cheese, and then a cheese's pins already there for you. oh!!

00:00:35.440 --> 00:00:36.120
alright

00:00:36.120 --> 00:00:40.680
So we are back in the works, and we've got some power tools. I am gonna drill a couple of pilot holes

00:00:40.950 --> 00:00:45.119
That's just so the wood doesn't crack when we screw into it , so we're gonna use a pair of needle nose pliers

00:00:45.309 --> 00:00:50.969
We're gonna bend this thing so that the loop kind of matches up with that  hold this back anymore, right? No there we go

00:00:52.030 --> 00:00:56.789
Alright, so that's what we have together. Hopefully that's gonna work. We just need something for the screws to hold into place

00:00:58.570 --> 00:01:02.099
So now you probably could just get away with putting one or two screws on here

00:01:02.100 --> 00:01:07.049
So in a snap shut you got one electrical connection we put two on the corners and connect the band

00:01:07.360 --> 00:01:10.619
Just in case because if one end is like hooked up

00:01:10.619 --> 00:01:15.239
And not making contact the other side still is so that's just kind of give this a little bit of redundancy

00:01:15.580 --> 00:01:23.129
This piece of the spring does not move it's static through the entire process, but it is fully connected to this band here there

00:01:23.130 --> 00:01:29.100
We go okay cool, so we got our contact back here that rigs up this entire system when that's pulled back

00:01:29.100 --> 00:01:33.059
It's completely separated then we have this down here. That'll be our secondary system

00:01:33.060 --> 00:01:35.909
And there'll be a gap in between we don't need this

00:01:36.400 --> 00:01:42.809
And we don't need this we just have one contact point there one contact point there when that's now shut

00:01:43.060 --> 00:01:45.060
Circuits complete and then we're on to something

00:01:46.970 --> 00:01:52.700
Shop classroom all right guys we rigged up a little demonstration here. We got this hooked up to 120 volts Ac which

00:01:52.700 --> 00:01:56.990
I don't recommend that's house power, but I made this little contraption. I'll turn on appliances

00:01:57.030 --> 00:02:02.270
We just want to see if it'll work so to set the switch all we have to do is keep the mousetrap open

00:02:02.730 --> 00:02:04.819
Put something that's really heavy over it

00:02:04.820 --> 00:02:09.260
And then walk away if you want you can conceal the wires and then this really comes along

00:02:09.260 --> 00:02:11.260
I say hey could you give me a hole saw?

00:02:12.300 --> 00:02:16.880
So you know that got aladdin where a booth lifts up that red Julie's not supposed to touch and it sets off all the booby

00:02:16.880 --> 00:02:20.809
Traps that's kind of what this is. Oh, so there's a pressure switch there, so when it lifted

00:02:21.990 --> 00:02:24.019
Yeah, we got a run made out of a mouse trap

00:02:24.030 --> 00:02:27.919
So you know I can set this back, and you won't be able to make it work. Yeah, it doesn't work now

00:02:27.920 --> 00:02:29.920
We got to find something heavier um

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:35.449
That was real that was not a prank nobody does that

00:02:35.720 --> 00:02:41.179
I know an even simpler version of this mouse trap is just to connect the wires directly to the pins themselves

00:02:41.180 --> 00:02:45.740
I just took the staple out and reposition it on the corner and tied the wire to it and you can see

00:02:46.080 --> 00:02:50.089
It when it snaps it makes the electrical circuit complete you don't even need any extra hardware

00:02:50.090 --> 00:02:52.080
just a couple of wires and a mousetrap

00:02:52.080 --> 00:02:56.209
it's policy to use this off of like a car battery or six volt lantern battery

00:02:56.209 --> 00:02:59.299
So this is kind of an out of the box idea. I went to the auto parts store

00:02:59.300 --> 00:03:02.839
I pick up a car horn and apparently this is one of the loudest ones

00:03:02.840 --> 00:03:08.149
So we're going to [rig] this thing to a car battery and then imagine you've got some kind of a heavy [object] on here

00:03:08.400 --> 00:03:11.150
Somebody lifts it up, or kicks it off or whatever and then this

00:03:13.760 --> 00:03:19.120
They have no idea what's hanging on or how to turn it off [do] is a living where would you hook it up?

00:03:19.120 --> 00:03:21.429
Have you had a car worn it you could put anywhere?

00:03:21.950 --> 00:03:25.630
Anywhere, where would you put it apparently we're going to ring this up in the living room

00:03:25.630 --> 00:03:27.729
So let's go get the car battery and see if we can make this thing work

00:03:36.190 --> 00:03:38.190
ah

00:03:50.280 --> 00:03:52.459
So we gotten a really good location

00:03:52.459 --> 00:03:55.759
It's really cool with [it], but the kids are coming home from school and then going to soccer practice

00:03:55.760 --> 00:03:58.700
So we're totally gonna prank them. We got a box of candy

00:03:59.370 --> 00:04:05.420
My kids are gonna. Love same concept except this one's kind of cool to just watch and the kids pick this up

00:04:05.970 --> 00:04:10.489
That one's gonna go off at the same time this bottom was gonna open up all this

00:04:10.950 --> 00:04:16.070
Different snacks on the spills in the  double braid family that pranks together stacy

00:04:27.320 --> 00:04:31.029
There we go. I smell poop waste did you poop your pants?

00:04:41.170 --> 00:04:45.490
Check this out actually dented the wall battle scars of a prank gone wrong

00:04:48.980 --> 00:04:52.360
So you can see this works really well with something like the car horn and a battery prank

00:04:52.360 --> 00:04:53.710
We totally got my wife did

00:04:53.710 --> 00:04:58.659
What would you guys put it put it underneath the garage door so when the door opens it goes off under the laundry basket?

00:04:58.850 --> 00:05:01.869
what if you even made a package where the prank was inside the box?

00:05:02.270 --> 00:05:07.449
Turn this thing upside down and have it underneath the box. No it goes off the hole. I've taken root

00:05:08.750 --> 00:05:14.500
So there you have it guys that's how to make a quick and easy pressure release mechanism using a mousetrap. this thing's awesome

00:05:14.800 --> 00:05:20.559
I would suggest using this off of 6 volt 9 volt or 12 volt batteries car batteries will work. Just as well

00:05:20.560 --> 00:05:21.200
and

00:05:21.200 --> 00:05:26.259
You can have a lot of fun rigging up booby traps and prank anyway big thanks to Dennis roady for flying out here to do

00:05:26.260 --> 00:05:30.520
This project with us today was a ton of fun, and we're gonna be doing something on his channel with mousetrap

00:05:30.520 --> 00:05:32.859
Yeah - the electricity just the mousetrap

00:05:33.080 --> 00:05:38.199
Strengths true friends of them should be a little bit safer things you can try at home will see over there or in the next

00:05:38.200 --> 00:05:40.200
Video, that's you then

00:05:41.090 --> 00:05:43.090
Muster Watch Macgyver a lot

00:05:50.870 --> 00:05:52.870
you
