00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.622
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:00:06.622 --> 00:00:08.380
- Good morning, everyone.

00:00:08.380 --> 00:00:11.040
I'm Liz Cohen, and I'm Dean
here at the Radcliffe Institute

00:00:11.040 --> 00:00:13.470
for Advanced Study and
I want to welcome you

00:00:13.470 --> 00:00:17.430
to today's conference,
Universities and Slavery Bound

00:00:17.430 --> 00:00:21.210
by History We are very excited
that today actually happened,

00:00:21.210 --> 00:00:22.110
came.

00:00:22.110 --> 00:00:24.540
We've been planning
this for a long time.

00:00:24.540 --> 00:00:26.520
We've been proud to
plan this conference

00:00:26.520 --> 00:00:29.340
with the Office of Harvard
University's President, Drew

00:00:29.340 --> 00:00:30.690
Gilpin Faust.

00:00:30.690 --> 00:00:34.410
And with Harvard faculty
members Professors Sven Beckert,

00:00:34.410 --> 00:00:37.500
Evelyn Brooks Higginbotham,
and Dan Carpenter,

00:00:37.500 --> 00:00:40.770
who is also the Faculty
Director of the Social Sciences

00:00:40.770 --> 00:00:42.420
at the Radcliffe Institute.

00:00:42.420 --> 00:00:45.810
I thank them all, along with
Radcliffe staff members,

00:00:45.810 --> 00:00:49.590
Rebecca Wassarman, Jessica
Viklund, and Chandra Manning,

00:00:49.590 --> 00:00:52.950
and their very talented
teams for their hard work

00:00:52.950 --> 00:00:55.650
organizing today's conference.

00:00:55.650 --> 00:00:58.470
As Harvard's Institute
for Advanced Study,

00:00:58.470 --> 00:01:02.310
Radcliffe's mission is to
foster interdisciplinary inquiry

00:01:02.310 --> 00:01:04.379
into important subjects.

00:01:04.379 --> 00:01:07.290
We regularly bring
leading thinkers together

00:01:07.290 --> 00:01:09.870
to investigate
profound questions

00:01:09.870 --> 00:01:14.010
like the ones we confront
today, how and why

00:01:14.010 --> 00:01:17.190
have institutions of
higher learning been deeply

00:01:17.190 --> 00:01:20.670
intertwined with the
institution of slavery

00:01:20.670 --> 00:01:23.880
Here at Harvard, across
the United States,

00:01:23.880 --> 00:01:25.830
and around the world?

00:01:25.830 --> 00:01:30.070
And what are the
implications of that history?

00:01:30.070 --> 00:01:34.330
No one academic field can answer
such complex and troubling

00:01:34.330 --> 00:01:35.570
questions.

00:01:35.570 --> 00:01:38.170
Which is why we felt that
the Radcliffe Institute would

00:01:38.170 --> 00:01:41.350
provide an ideal
venue for historians,

00:01:41.350 --> 00:01:43.930
civic leaders, artists,
and many others

00:01:43.930 --> 00:01:46.240
to delve together
into the fraught

00:01:46.240 --> 00:01:49.990
relationship between
universities and slavery.

00:01:49.990 --> 00:01:52.540
I am pleased to share this
day with so many of you

00:01:52.540 --> 00:01:55.450
here in Radcliffe Yard
whether you are a high school

00:01:55.450 --> 00:01:58.570
student or a scholar of
international acclaim,

00:01:58.570 --> 00:02:00.910
and with many more
of you online.

00:02:00.910 --> 00:02:03.800
A warm welcome to everyone.

00:02:03.800 --> 00:02:06.040
I hope you will take
advantage of the opportunity

00:02:06.040 --> 00:02:10.060
to visit a special exhibition
entitled Bound by History

00:02:10.060 --> 00:02:12.970
Harvard Slavery and Archives
at the Harvard University

00:02:12.970 --> 00:02:17.740
Archives, which is located
in Pusey Library in Harvard

00:02:17.740 --> 00:02:20.080
Yard adjacent to
Widener Library.

00:02:20.080 --> 00:02:22.480
Ordinarily, this exhibit
is open on weekdays,

00:02:22.480 --> 00:02:24.700
but it will also
be open tomorrow,

00:02:24.700 --> 00:02:29.200
Saturday, March 4 from 9:00
AM to 2:00 PM to allow as many

00:02:29.200 --> 00:02:31.800
of you as possible to view it.

00:02:31.800 --> 00:02:34.420
I would also be delighted
to welcome you back

00:02:34.420 --> 00:02:36.850
to attend one of the
many other public events

00:02:36.850 --> 00:02:40.360
that the Radcliffe Institute
hosts throughout the year.

00:02:40.360 --> 00:02:43.000
You can learn more about what's
coming up from the calendar

00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:46.330
brochure at your seat and
on the Radcliffe website.

00:02:46.330 --> 00:02:49.870
But I want to take a moment to
mention our culminating event

00:02:49.870 --> 00:02:51.580
of this academic year--

00:02:51.580 --> 00:02:55.420
Radcliffe Day on Friday, May 26.

00:02:55.420 --> 00:02:59.110
This day is dedicated annually
to honoring excellence

00:02:59.110 --> 00:03:01.570
and inquiry, and
presenting the Radcliffe

00:03:01.570 --> 00:03:05.500
Medal to an individual who has
had a transformative impact

00:03:05.500 --> 00:03:07.120
on society.

00:03:07.120 --> 00:03:11.230
This year, we will make history
and present two Radcliffe

00:03:11.230 --> 00:03:12.260
Medals.

00:03:12.260 --> 00:03:14.620
One to Judy Woodruff
and the other,

00:03:14.620 --> 00:03:18.730
posthumously to Gwen Eiffel
for their many stellar years

00:03:18.730 --> 00:03:22.090
as co-anchors of
the PBS News Hour.

00:03:22.090 --> 00:03:25.030
The day will honor the
individual and joint

00:03:25.030 --> 00:03:27.370
accomplishments of
these two journalists

00:03:27.370 --> 00:03:31.240
and the crucial importance
of integrity in journalism.

00:03:31.240 --> 00:03:34.570
You can find more details
on the Institute's website,

00:03:34.570 --> 00:03:37.090
and I hope that
you will join us.

00:03:37.090 --> 00:03:40.480
Today's conference allows
us all to participate

00:03:40.480 --> 00:03:45.000
in an urgent conversation
about universities and slavery.

00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:47.650
Universities propel
our society forward

00:03:47.650 --> 00:03:50.440
through pioneering research
and the dissemination

00:03:50.440 --> 00:03:51.880
of new knowledge.

00:03:51.880 --> 00:03:55.160
But they are also shaped
by their past, both

00:03:55.160 --> 00:04:00.070
the praiseworthy aspects and
the elements we prefer to avoid,

00:04:00.070 --> 00:04:04.030
Including those closely
bound up with slavery.

00:04:04.030 --> 00:04:06.490
Discussions about
universities and slavery

00:04:06.490 --> 00:04:09.240
began on individual campuses.

00:04:09.240 --> 00:04:13.300
In 2003, Brown University
President Ruth Simmons

00:04:13.300 --> 00:04:16.899
appointed a steering committee
on slavery and justice.

00:04:16.899 --> 00:04:21.519
And in 2007, Brown committed
to taking concrete steps

00:04:21.519 --> 00:04:26.170
to address and memorialize the
role of slavery in its history.

00:04:26.170 --> 00:04:28.780
In that same year,
Professors Sven Beckert

00:04:28.780 --> 00:04:32.860
began teaching an undergraduate
research seminar on the history

00:04:32.860 --> 00:04:35.470
of slavery here at Harvard.

00:04:35.470 --> 00:04:38.050
Meanwhile, descendants
of James Rollins,

00:04:38.050 --> 00:04:41.140
known as the Father of the
University of Missouri,

00:04:41.140 --> 00:04:45.850
established the James S. Rollins
Slavery Atonement Endowment

00:04:45.850 --> 00:04:48.760
to support the University
of Missouri's black studies

00:04:48.760 --> 00:04:50.450
program.

00:04:50.450 --> 00:04:53.900
As the realization
spread that institutions

00:04:53.900 --> 00:04:57.830
of higher learning and
the institution of slavery

00:04:57.830 --> 00:05:00.440
shared an
interconnected history,

00:05:00.440 --> 00:05:03.290
many more schools
began investigating

00:05:03.290 --> 00:05:05.990
how slaves and
slavery had helped

00:05:05.990 --> 00:05:09.380
construct, in all
senses of that word,

00:05:09.380 --> 00:05:12.530
their own hallowed
halls of learning.

00:05:12.530 --> 00:05:16.820
Soon, universities began looking
beyond their own campus gates

00:05:16.820 --> 00:05:19.340
to learn more about
the role of slavery

00:05:19.340 --> 00:05:23.150
in the development of higher
education more broadly.

00:05:23.150 --> 00:05:26.240
Collective efforts have
included a landmark conference

00:05:26.240 --> 00:05:29.390
hosted by Emory
University in 2011,

00:05:29.390 --> 00:05:32.570
and the University Studying
Slavery Initiative, which

00:05:32.570 --> 00:05:36.590
began among schools in Virginia
and is now spread across state

00:05:36.590 --> 00:05:40.160
lines to include institutions
throughout the eastern half

00:05:40.160 --> 00:05:42.230
of the United States.

00:05:42.230 --> 00:05:43.790
The number of
universities coming

00:05:43.790 --> 00:05:47.420
to terms with this unsettling
part of their histories

00:05:47.420 --> 00:05:49.490
continues to grow.

00:05:49.490 --> 00:05:52.520
Students in the United
States and around the world

00:05:52.520 --> 00:05:54.980
are asking their
schools and colleges

00:05:54.980 --> 00:05:59.210
to take down statues of
slave-owning or slave-trading

00:05:59.210 --> 00:06:05.390
founders, rename buildings, and
redesign university insignia.

00:06:05.390 --> 00:06:09.920
Many of you in this audience
come from campuses now taking

00:06:09.920 --> 00:06:12.920
seriously the
responsibility of learning

00:06:12.920 --> 00:06:17.690
what slavery has meant at
and for your own institution.

00:06:17.690 --> 00:06:22.670
Now it is time to make sure that
the larger public is included

00:06:22.670 --> 00:06:25.070
in this important conversation.

00:06:25.070 --> 00:06:27.920
So I am delighted at the
broad and diverse audience

00:06:27.920 --> 00:06:30.630
that we have
gathered here today.

00:06:30.630 --> 00:06:33.000
In order to move
forward, we must first

00:06:33.000 --> 00:06:36.060
reckon with a complicated past.

00:06:36.060 --> 00:06:39.710
Through the impressive efforts
of many dedicated researchers

00:06:39.710 --> 00:06:43.230
we've been learning a great
deal about how slavery benefited

00:06:43.230 --> 00:06:46.020
universities financially
and through the labor

00:06:46.020 --> 00:06:48.240
of enslaved individuals.

00:06:48.240 --> 00:06:51.330
But we shouldn't
overlook how it also

00:06:51.330 --> 00:06:55.320
influence universities
intellectual development.

00:06:55.320 --> 00:06:59.820
Slavery shaped teaching methods,
curricula, and the evolution

00:06:59.820 --> 00:07:01.920
of entire disciplines.

00:07:01.920 --> 00:07:05.580
Today's conference will take
us deep into the consideration

00:07:05.580 --> 00:07:08.430
of these multifaceted
relationships.

00:07:08.430 --> 00:07:11.850
Let's begin by looking at
the cover of your conference

00:07:11.850 --> 00:07:14.090
program.

00:07:14.090 --> 00:07:16.560
So if you want to dig that out.

00:07:16.560 --> 00:07:20.040
The program cover
features a portrait

00:07:20.040 --> 00:07:24.150
of a man named Renty
who was born in Africa,

00:07:24.150 --> 00:07:27.780
kidnapped, and sold into
slavery in the United States

00:07:27.780 --> 00:07:30.990
in the first half
of the 19th century.

00:07:30.990 --> 00:07:34.230
This image was
taken in 1850, when

00:07:34.230 --> 00:07:38.610
Renty was a slave at Edgehill
Plantation near Columbia, South

00:07:38.610 --> 00:07:40.330
Carolina.

00:07:40.330 --> 00:07:45.520
Portraits were chiefly reserved
for the well-to-do in 1850.

00:07:45.520 --> 00:07:49.470
So who took this image, and why?

00:07:49.470 --> 00:07:51.660
It turns out, that
the portrait was

00:07:51.660 --> 00:07:56.070
taken for Louis Agassiz, a
Harvard professor and a world

00:07:56.070 --> 00:07:58.900
renowned scientist in his day.

00:07:58.900 --> 00:08:01.800
He was one of the inaugural
professors at the Lawrence

00:08:01.800 --> 00:08:05.070
Scientific School, the
precursor of today's

00:08:05.070 --> 00:08:08.070
John A. Paulson School of
Engineering and Applied

00:08:08.070 --> 00:08:10.530
Sciences here at Harvard.

00:08:10.530 --> 00:08:12.750
Some of you, in
fact, are watching

00:08:12.750 --> 00:08:16.230
from Agassiz House, that's
our overflow space, where

00:08:16.230 --> 00:08:19.260
we will all gather later
today for a reception

00:08:19.260 --> 00:08:20.820
after the conference.

00:08:20.820 --> 00:08:24.330
That building is named for
Elizabeth Cary Agassiz,

00:08:24.330 --> 00:08:27.810
herself a teacher, president
of Radcliffe College,

00:08:27.810 --> 00:08:29.760
and Louie's wife.

00:08:29.760 --> 00:08:33.780
Louis Agassiz was a proponent
of a scientific theory that

00:08:33.780 --> 00:08:36.240
was regarded as one of
the most cutting edge

00:08:36.240 --> 00:08:40.530
ideas of his day, the
Theory of Polygenesis.

00:08:40.530 --> 00:08:44.430
That theory denied that all
humans shared common ancestry,

00:08:44.430 --> 00:08:48.360
and instead posited that
different races were actually

00:08:48.360 --> 00:08:51.600
distinct and unequal species.

00:08:51.600 --> 00:08:55.710
In 1850, Agassiz traveled to
a South Carolina plantation

00:08:55.710 --> 00:08:58.530
to gather evidence
for polygenesis.

00:08:58.530 --> 00:09:02.220
He observed enslaved workers
there and long after his return

00:09:02.220 --> 00:09:04.320
to Cambridge, he
studied portraits

00:09:04.320 --> 00:09:08.990
taken of five of the men
and two of the women.

00:09:08.990 --> 00:09:12.590
Agassiz classified and
cataloged those men and women

00:09:12.590 --> 00:09:14.780
by their physical
characteristics,

00:09:14.780 --> 00:09:18.650
in much the same way that he
had classified and cataloged

00:09:18.650 --> 00:09:22.070
species of animals
earlier in his career.

00:09:22.070 --> 00:09:25.530
The image of Renty that you see
on the cover of your program,

00:09:25.530 --> 00:09:29.630
and here on the screen,
is one of those images.

00:09:29.630 --> 00:09:33.890
To Agassiz, Renty was a specimen
to inform the Harvard teaching

00:09:33.890 --> 00:09:36.740
curriculum and to contribute
to the development

00:09:36.740 --> 00:09:39.710
of the academic disciplines
of comparative anatomy

00:09:39.710 --> 00:09:41.450
and anthropology.

00:09:41.450 --> 00:09:44.210
Renty's cataloged
biological characteristics

00:09:44.210 --> 00:09:46.280
were what interested Agassiz.

00:09:46.280 --> 00:09:50.660
Today, it is Renty's personal
story that interests us.

00:09:50.660 --> 00:09:53.000
So what do we know
about that story?

00:09:53.000 --> 00:09:55.370
The historical record
tells us that Renty was

00:09:55.370 --> 00:09:57.800
a member of the Congo Tribe.

00:09:57.800 --> 00:09:59.570
The historical record
tells us that he

00:09:59.570 --> 00:10:01.640
spent his days laboring.

00:10:01.640 --> 00:10:04.700
The historical record tells
us that he was a father.

00:10:04.700 --> 00:10:08.900
His daughter Delia also worked
on the Edgehill Plantation.

00:10:08.900 --> 00:10:12.590
Renty was surely much more
than either Agassiz's list

00:10:12.590 --> 00:10:15.050
of characteristics
or the bare facts

00:10:15.050 --> 00:10:18.530
revealed in the conventional
written historical record.

00:10:18.530 --> 00:10:20.840
Much of his personal
story remains

00:10:20.840 --> 00:10:24.080
unknown, or pieced
together by conjecture

00:10:24.080 --> 00:10:28.070
because so much has been erased
from that written record.

00:10:28.070 --> 00:10:29.990
But that does not
mean that we should

00:10:29.990 --> 00:10:32.960
stop trying to know more.

00:10:32.960 --> 00:10:35.180
We have in fact hosted
two seminars here

00:10:35.180 --> 00:10:37.250
at Radcliffe on
the Agassiz images.

00:10:37.250 --> 00:10:41.420
One in 2012 and another
in 2015, and you

00:10:41.420 --> 00:10:45.350
can read more about one campaign
to elevate Renty, literally,

00:10:45.350 --> 00:10:47.570
in my note in your program.

00:10:47.570 --> 00:10:49.730
For many years
the Agassiz images

00:10:49.730 --> 00:10:52.700
remained hidden in an
attic here at Harvard

00:10:52.700 --> 00:10:58.070
until Peabody Museum staff
rediscovered them in 1976.

00:10:58.070 --> 00:11:01.520
Similarly, the historical
tie between universities

00:11:01.520 --> 00:11:04.910
and slavery has remained
buried for years.

00:11:04.910 --> 00:11:07.610
But that relationship
could never fully

00:11:07.610 --> 00:11:11.780
disappear, any more than Renty's
photograph truly vanished--

00:11:11.780 --> 00:11:14.420
even when it was out of sight.

00:11:14.420 --> 00:11:16.730
Now we must comb
through the attics

00:11:16.730 --> 00:11:20.450
and open the disturbing drawers
of our universities past,

00:11:20.450 --> 00:11:22.640
no matter how difficult.

00:11:22.640 --> 00:11:24.650
As we do, I trust
that we will grow

00:11:24.650 --> 00:11:28.160
to appreciate more and more
how an image like Renty's has

00:11:28.160 --> 00:11:31.550
significance far beyond
the Edgehill Plantation

00:11:31.550 --> 00:11:35.330
in Columbia, South Carolina,
where he was enslaved.

00:11:35.330 --> 00:11:37.100
Thanks to our
distinguished speakers

00:11:37.100 --> 00:11:39.980
assembled here today and
through all of our efforts.

00:11:39.980 --> 00:11:43.370
We will and we must
continue to unearth history

00:11:43.370 --> 00:11:46.370
today and commit
to ensuring that it

00:11:46.370 --> 00:11:49.490
informs our work going forward.

00:11:49.490 --> 00:11:52.910
It is now my great pleasure
to welcome to the podium

00:11:52.910 --> 00:11:55.160
distinguished historian
and Harvard University

00:11:55.160 --> 00:11:56.960
President, Drew Gilpin Faust.

00:11:56.960 --> 00:12:00.404
[APPLAUSE]

00:12:07.790 --> 00:12:08.720
- Thank you.

00:12:08.720 --> 00:12:09.410
Thank you.

00:12:09.410 --> 00:12:13.160
I want to express my deepest
appreciation to Dean Lizabeth

00:12:13.160 --> 00:12:15.320
Cohen and her
Radcliffe colleagues

00:12:15.320 --> 00:12:17.900
for taking on my
request to sponsor

00:12:17.900 --> 00:12:22.430
this conference with such
enthusiasm and dedication.

00:12:22.430 --> 00:12:24.950
We are all very
much in their debt.

00:12:24.950 --> 00:12:28.970
I want to give special thanks to
faculty conference organizers,

00:12:28.970 --> 00:12:32.720
Evelyn Brooks Higginbotham,
Sven Beckert, and Dan Carpenter,

00:12:32.720 --> 00:12:35.360
for shaping such a rich program.

00:12:35.360 --> 00:12:37.340
And I also want to say
a special thank you

00:12:37.340 --> 00:12:40.550
to Megan Sniffin-Marinoff
and the staff of the Harvard

00:12:40.550 --> 00:12:45.200
University Archives for their
efforts to find our history.

00:12:45.200 --> 00:12:48.860
These are just in their early
stages, they will continue,

00:12:48.860 --> 00:12:52.430
but the exhibit that they
have already put together

00:12:52.430 --> 00:12:54.260
and the things they've
already uncovered

00:12:54.260 --> 00:12:57.740
are the beginning of a
very important trajectory

00:12:57.740 --> 00:13:01.640
of discovery that we
will be engaged in.

00:13:01.640 --> 00:13:03.950
Last April, members of
the Harvard community

00:13:03.950 --> 00:13:06.860
gathered together with
Congressman John Lewis

00:13:06.860 --> 00:13:10.820
to place a plaque at
Wadsworth House commemorating

00:13:10.820 --> 00:13:13.670
the lives of four
enslaved persons who had,

00:13:13.670 --> 00:13:16.520
during the 18th
century, worked there

00:13:16.520 --> 00:13:20.030
in the households of
two Harvard presidents.

00:13:20.030 --> 00:13:24.320
This effort was intended to
be one milestone in a broader

00:13:24.320 --> 00:13:27.410
exploration of an
aspect of Harvard's past

00:13:27.410 --> 00:13:30.710
that has been rarely
acknowledged and poorly

00:13:30.710 --> 00:13:32.510
understood.

00:13:32.510 --> 00:13:36.920
Harvard was directly complicit
in slavery from the college's

00:13:36.920 --> 00:13:40.880
earliest days in
the 17th century,

00:13:40.880 --> 00:13:46.820
until the system of bondage
ended in Massachusetts in 1783.

00:13:46.820 --> 00:13:50.150
Then, through financial and
other ties with the slave

00:13:50.150 --> 00:13:54.530
South, Harvard continued to
be involved with slavery up

00:13:54.530 --> 00:13:57.710
until the time of emancipation.

00:13:57.710 --> 00:14:02.120
This history and its legacy
have shaped our institution

00:14:02.120 --> 00:14:05.840
in ways we have yet
to fully understand.

00:14:05.840 --> 00:14:08.000
Today's conference
is intended to help

00:14:08.000 --> 00:14:11.450
us explore parts of
the past that have

00:14:11.450 --> 00:14:14.600
remained all but invisible.

00:14:14.600 --> 00:14:17.840
To acknowledge those
realities is essential

00:14:17.840 --> 00:14:21.320
if we are to undermine the
legacies of race and slavery

00:14:21.320 --> 00:14:24.530
that continue to
divide our nation.

00:14:24.530 --> 00:14:26.750
And if we are to
commit ourselves

00:14:26.750 --> 00:14:29.450
to building a better future.

00:14:29.450 --> 00:14:33.980
Slavery of course, is part,
not just of Harvard's history,

00:14:33.980 --> 00:14:37.610
but embedded in the past of
universities across the United

00:14:37.610 --> 00:14:42.260
States and in the world
beyond our national borders.

00:14:42.260 --> 00:14:46.610
Today we will also examine
this broader context,

00:14:46.610 --> 00:14:50.600
investigating historical
similarities and differences,

00:14:50.600 --> 00:14:54.170
as well as the range
of contemporary efforts

00:14:54.170 --> 00:14:58.400
to confront slavery's
distressing legacies.

00:14:58.400 --> 00:15:03.050
So we look at both past and
present today in the firm

00:15:03.050 --> 00:15:06.950
belief that only by coming
to terms with history can

00:15:06.950 --> 00:15:11.670
we free ourselves to
create a more just world.

00:15:11.670 --> 00:15:16.280
Thank you for joining
us in that enterprise.

00:15:16.280 --> 00:15:19.460
As our keynote
speaker, we are honored

00:15:19.460 --> 00:15:24.260
to have the ideal person
to lead us in that work.

00:15:24.260 --> 00:15:26.750
His many honors
and accomplishments

00:15:26.750 --> 00:15:29.640
are detailed in your program.

00:15:29.640 --> 00:15:32.990
Please join me in
welcoming Ta-Nehisi Coates.

00:15:32.990 --> 00:15:36.490
[APPLAUSE]

00:15:53.391 --> 00:15:53.890
- I was--

00:15:56.880 --> 00:16:00.060
Whenever I, and I've been
blessed one or two times

00:16:00.060 --> 00:16:03.210
to do things with
President Faust,

00:16:03.210 --> 00:16:06.840
and I told her that I was
going to resist the temptation

00:16:06.840 --> 00:16:09.660
to gush over her
work as a historian.

00:16:09.660 --> 00:16:12.300
Before I knew President
Faust was President Faust,

00:16:12.300 --> 00:16:15.190
I knew her as Dr. Drew Gilpin
Faust through her work.

00:16:15.190 --> 00:16:19.170
And then I realized she was
actually president of Harvard.

00:16:19.170 --> 00:16:21.850
I say that not as--

00:16:21.850 --> 00:16:25.170
just as a mere note
of flattery, it

00:16:25.170 --> 00:16:29.820
is a tremendous, tremendous
honor to be here,

00:16:29.820 --> 00:16:33.300
and in many ways, to my mind,
it's a little absurd to have me

00:16:33.300 --> 00:16:35.730
here as a keynote
speaker, because I

00:16:35.730 --> 00:16:37.730
learn so much from you guys.

00:16:37.730 --> 00:16:39.510
And I'm speaking
about the historians,

00:16:39.510 --> 00:16:42.840
and the sociologists, and
academics in the audience,

00:16:42.840 --> 00:16:44.700
and the political scientists.

00:16:44.700 --> 00:16:47.377
I've been blessed
with this opportunity.

00:16:47.377 --> 00:16:48.960
As a writer for the
Atlantic Magazine,

00:16:48.960 --> 00:16:53.580
which has this huge platform
and it's huge megaphone,

00:16:53.580 --> 00:16:56.670
but sometimes people
make the mistake

00:16:56.670 --> 00:16:58.890
of thinking because it's
the first time they've

00:16:58.890 --> 00:17:01.860
seen something that you're
the originator of that work.

00:17:01.860 --> 00:17:05.099
And I want to do
right now what I

00:17:05.099 --> 00:17:08.790
try to do all the time and
disabuse people of that notion.

00:17:08.790 --> 00:17:11.880
My job, a big part of
my job is I see it,

00:17:11.880 --> 00:17:14.369
is to really just
use that megaphone

00:17:14.369 --> 00:17:19.261
to amplify some of the great
work that that's happening.

00:17:19.261 --> 00:17:20.760
When I came to the
Atlantic, I think

00:17:20.760 --> 00:17:22.859
I had a basic,
what one might call

00:17:22.859 --> 00:17:27.244
a conventional, liberal
perspective on race and racism

00:17:27.244 --> 00:17:27.910
in this country.

00:17:27.910 --> 00:17:30.030
And I guess I would have
said race at that time.

00:17:30.030 --> 00:17:32.580
And the basic notion
was that black people

00:17:32.580 --> 00:17:36.600
were a class of people who,
for historical reasons,

00:17:36.600 --> 00:17:40.020
suffered a greater
percentage of poverty.

00:17:40.020 --> 00:17:41.970
And one of the ways
to deal with that

00:17:41.970 --> 00:17:46.460
was if you could direct
traditional programs that we

00:17:46.460 --> 00:17:48.030
use for folks that
are impoverished

00:17:48.030 --> 00:17:52.410
towards black folks then
everything would be OK.

00:17:52.410 --> 00:17:54.560
But again largely,
from the research

00:17:54.560 --> 00:17:56.610
of people who were
assembled in this room,

00:17:56.610 --> 00:17:59.430
I came two conclusions.

00:17:59.430 --> 00:18:01.680
The first was that black
people, in and of themselves,

00:18:01.680 --> 00:18:03.530
are class in America.

00:18:03.530 --> 00:18:05.520
And that goes across
the board for what

00:18:05.520 --> 00:18:08.550
we consider conventional
class that you can't really

00:18:08.550 --> 00:18:12.720
talk about an upper middle
class, a black upper middle

00:18:12.720 --> 00:18:14.640
class, and a white
upper middle class

00:18:14.640 --> 00:18:16.860
as though they're somehow equal.

00:18:16.860 --> 00:18:21.000
You can't talk about a black
poverty and white poverty

00:18:21.000 --> 00:18:23.940
as those two things
are somehow equal.

00:18:23.940 --> 00:18:29.040
That the very ecology that black
folks exist in different places

00:18:29.040 --> 00:18:30.900
is very, very different.

00:18:30.900 --> 00:18:33.360
I grew up in West Baltimore.

00:18:33.360 --> 00:18:35.280
I had two parents in my house.

00:18:35.280 --> 00:18:36.990
I had parents who
valued education,

00:18:36.990 --> 00:18:40.980
both my parents eventually
became college graduates.

00:18:40.980 --> 00:18:44.310
Reading was very, very
much stress in my house.

00:18:44.310 --> 00:18:47.220
But I didn't have a single
friend in my neighborhood

00:18:47.220 --> 00:18:48.900
who was like me.

00:18:48.900 --> 00:18:50.880
The vast majority of
my friends did not

00:18:50.880 --> 00:18:53.502
have fathers in their home.

00:18:53.502 --> 00:18:55.960
A significant number of them
didn't even know their fathers

00:18:55.960 --> 00:18:58.530
and, at my class
at school, it was

00:18:58.530 --> 00:19:02.100
nothing-- there were very few,
if any, families like the one I

00:19:02.100 --> 00:19:02.610
grew up in.

00:19:02.610 --> 00:19:06.690
My family was unique for other
reasons, which I've detailed,

00:19:06.690 --> 00:19:09.000
but just in that sort of
basic sense, what I'm saying

00:19:09.000 --> 00:19:12.184
is the basic ecology
was different.

00:19:12.184 --> 00:19:14.100
What that meant was the
neighborhood I was in,

00:19:14.100 --> 00:19:17.100
it wasn't the same amount
of social capital assembled

00:19:17.100 --> 00:19:18.660
that might have
been true if you had

00:19:18.660 --> 00:19:20.580
taken that same
profile of a family

00:19:20.580 --> 00:19:24.550
and that family had been white.

00:19:24.550 --> 00:19:25.670
Robert Sampson who is--

00:19:25.670 --> 00:19:26.620
Rob, are you here?

00:19:26.620 --> 00:19:27.880
I got a note saying
you're going to be here.

00:19:27.880 --> 00:19:29.130
I don't know if Rob made it.

00:19:29.130 --> 00:19:30.046
Oh, there he is there.

00:19:30.046 --> 00:19:31.912
Hey, Rob, how are
you doing, man?

00:19:31.912 --> 00:19:33.370
I'm going to make
this very, very--

00:19:33.370 --> 00:19:34.828
So you know, Rob
has actually, he's

00:19:34.828 --> 00:19:36.351
been a very, very significant.

00:19:36.351 --> 00:19:38.350
Bruce Weston, Devah Pager,
and Rob, these people

00:19:38.350 --> 00:19:40.630
have been very, very significant
to me understanding what I'm

00:19:40.630 --> 00:19:41.900
going to try to layout here.

00:19:41.900 --> 00:19:45.280
Rob, in his book, The Great
American City, Chicago,

00:19:45.280 --> 00:19:48.670
and the Enduring Neighborhood
Effect, has a chart

00:19:48.670 --> 00:19:52.030
and on one axis, you see
the incarceration rate

00:19:52.030 --> 00:19:55.630
from 1992 1995, when
on the other axis

00:19:55.630 --> 00:19:59.290
you see the incarceration
rate from 2000 to 2005.

00:19:59.290 --> 00:20:01.090
And the effect is that
the further up you

00:20:01.090 --> 00:20:03.400
go the axis you
can see people who

00:20:03.400 --> 00:20:07.840
are cross those two periods
have higher incarceration rates.

00:20:07.840 --> 00:20:10.390
And along the line
you have neighborhoods

00:20:10.390 --> 00:20:14.477
throughout Chicago bunched up
way at the top of this line.

00:20:14.477 --> 00:20:16.060
That is to say, the
neighborhoods that

00:20:16.060 --> 00:20:17.650
have had the highest
incarceration

00:20:17.650 --> 00:20:20.620
rates across this period
that Rob is studying,

00:20:20.620 --> 00:20:22.260
you see totally
black neighborhoods,

00:20:22.260 --> 00:20:24.634
There are no white neighborhoods
at the top of that line.

00:20:24.634 --> 00:20:27.550
And then at the bottom of that
line where you see the lowest

00:20:27.550 --> 00:20:30.172
amount of incarceration
rates across this period,

00:20:30.172 --> 00:20:31.380
it's all white neighborhoods.

00:20:31.380 --> 00:20:33.340
It's not even a bit
of overlap, there's

00:20:33.340 --> 00:20:35.230
point in which
the two intersect.

00:20:35.230 --> 00:20:37.810
Indeed, as Rob points
out, the highest

00:20:37.810 --> 00:20:41.980
ranked black community
has an imprisonment

00:20:41.980 --> 00:20:45.760
rate over 40 times higher
than the highest ranked

00:20:45.760 --> 00:20:46.880
white community.

00:20:46.880 --> 00:20:50.140
It's two different ecologies.

00:20:50.140 --> 00:20:51.140
It's not the same thing.

00:20:51.140 --> 00:20:53.710
There is no black middle
class neighborhood,

00:20:53.710 --> 00:20:56.260
or black upper middle
class neighborhood

00:20:56.260 --> 00:20:59.290
in Chicago with the
effects somehow mirror--

00:20:59.290 --> 00:21:00.340
not even a black--

00:21:00.340 --> 00:21:01.840
not even a white
upper middle class,

00:21:01.840 --> 00:21:03.548
but a white poor
neighborhood, there just

00:21:03.548 --> 00:21:06.060
is no overlap at all.

00:21:08.740 --> 00:21:09.870
That was the sociology.

00:21:09.870 --> 00:21:12.940
And then what I got from the
history was the reasoning.

00:21:12.940 --> 00:21:15.310
That they said that something
had actually happened.

00:21:15.310 --> 00:21:17.920
And you know when I started
this period of study

00:21:17.920 --> 00:21:21.850
in my life I had a basic
understanding that, yeah

00:21:21.850 --> 00:21:24.716
slavery had happened in
this country, it was bad.

00:21:24.716 --> 00:21:25.840
There had been a civil war.

00:21:25.840 --> 00:21:28.030
Civil War might have had
something to do with it.

00:21:28.030 --> 00:21:29.440
I mean, I'm sort of
ashamed of myself.

00:21:29.440 --> 00:21:30.460
This was not this long ago.

00:21:30.460 --> 00:21:31.710
I mean this like 10 years ago.

00:21:31.710 --> 00:21:35.930
This was a very, very
recent development.

00:21:35.930 --> 00:21:38.280
And then what you come to
realize is that, no, no, no,

00:21:38.280 --> 00:21:40.180
slavery was big business.

00:21:40.180 --> 00:21:42.700
It actually was big,
big, like it was huge.

00:21:42.700 --> 00:21:44.980
I mean so huge
that it's literally

00:21:44.980 --> 00:21:49.450
impossible to imagine the United
States of America without it.

00:21:49.450 --> 00:21:52.240
That sounds rhetorical
and people stand up

00:21:52.240 --> 00:21:56.680
and they make that sort of
bold claim all the time.

00:21:56.680 --> 00:22:00.700
[INAUDIBLE] if you talk about
the four million enslaved

00:22:00.700 --> 00:22:03.550
African-Americans in
this country in 1860,

00:22:03.550 --> 00:22:06.070
and again I feel a bit absurd
making this statement to this

00:22:06.070 --> 00:22:07.840
learned audience, but I'm aware
there are other people out

00:22:07.840 --> 00:22:08.920
there watching also--

00:22:11.600 --> 00:22:15.050
those four million
African-Americans collectively

00:22:15.050 --> 00:22:18.920
are worth $3 billion
in that period of time.

00:22:18.920 --> 00:22:22.510
What that means to
put that in context,

00:22:22.510 --> 00:22:24.660
and give you some
sense, just not

00:22:24.660 --> 00:22:26.340
to make it an abstract
number, if you

00:22:26.340 --> 00:22:30.510
took all of the productive
capacity of this country

00:22:30.510 --> 00:22:32.400
in 1860, if you
took all the banks,

00:22:32.400 --> 00:22:34.200
if you took all the
railroads, if you

00:22:34.200 --> 00:22:36.600
took all the nascent factories,
if you took everything

00:22:36.600 --> 00:22:38.640
that you might would
consider industry,

00:22:38.640 --> 00:22:41.100
and you put it in
one pile over here,

00:22:41.100 --> 00:22:42.990
and you put the
four million bodies

00:22:42.990 --> 00:22:44.550
of the enslaved
African-Americans

00:22:44.550 --> 00:22:46.500
in this country, black
people in this country,

00:22:46.500 --> 00:22:48.870
they were worth more than the
entire productive capacity

00:22:48.870 --> 00:22:49.536
in this country.

00:22:49.536 --> 00:22:53.070
It was by far the greatest
asset in this country.

00:22:53.070 --> 00:22:57.750
If you wanted to go and find
the largest concentration

00:22:57.750 --> 00:22:59.940
of millionaires and
multimillionaires

00:22:59.940 --> 00:23:03.540
in this country in 1860,
you wouldn't go to New York,

00:23:03.540 --> 00:23:05.880
you wouldn't go to Chicago,
you would not come up here

00:23:05.880 --> 00:23:07.260
to Boston or to Cambridge.

00:23:07.260 --> 00:23:10.157
You would go to the
Mississippi River Valley.

00:23:10.157 --> 00:23:12.240
And the reason for that
was obviously the business

00:23:12.240 --> 00:23:13.281
that was conducted there.

00:23:13.281 --> 00:23:18.450
The business being based on
the bodies of black people.

00:23:18.450 --> 00:23:20.330
I think as this
conference illustrates,

00:23:20.330 --> 00:23:24.120
and as President Faust
illustrated in her comment,

00:23:24.120 --> 00:23:28.020
this was not merely a southern
problem, 60% of our exports

00:23:28.020 --> 00:23:30.990
as a country were
cotton in 1860.

00:23:30.990 --> 00:23:33.982
We're all tied to this.

00:23:33.982 --> 00:23:35.440
And when you begin
to understand it

00:23:35.440 --> 00:23:38.440
as business, when you begin to
be able to put numbers on it,

00:23:38.440 --> 00:23:40.807
when you begin to see
the huge enterprise,

00:23:40.807 --> 00:23:42.640
understand that the
United States of America

00:23:42.640 --> 00:23:44.809
was not a country with
a little bit of slavery,

00:23:44.809 --> 00:23:46.350
but it was actually
a slave society--

00:23:46.350 --> 00:23:48.910
when you start to wrap
your head around that

00:23:48.910 --> 00:23:52.540
and what that meant, that
begins to make connections

00:23:52.540 --> 00:23:54.440
to where you are now.

00:23:54.440 --> 00:23:56.920
Especially when you can analyze
all the attending effects.

00:23:56.920 --> 00:24:00.500
I tell people all the
time, we talk about

00:24:00.500 --> 00:24:04.700
enslavement as though we
were a bump in the road.

00:24:04.700 --> 00:24:07.567
And I tell people it's the
road, it's the actual road.

00:24:07.567 --> 00:24:09.650
It's the actual-- And I
know there's like debate--

00:24:09.650 --> 00:24:12.260
this debate right now between
historians and economists

00:24:12.260 --> 00:24:13.760
about whether it could
have been another way?

00:24:13.760 --> 00:24:16.010
Could you have had America--
and maybe you could have,

00:24:16.010 --> 00:24:17.420
but this is the way it happened.

00:24:17.420 --> 00:24:18.253
This is the way it--

00:24:18.253 --> 00:24:20.120
If I coulda, woulda, shoulda.

00:24:20.120 --> 00:24:21.650
This is what happened though.

00:24:21.650 --> 00:24:24.850
This is the thing that
actually happened.

00:24:24.850 --> 00:24:29.150
I want to offer, during
my brief time here,

00:24:29.150 --> 00:24:32.430
I just want to offer
a few suggestions

00:24:32.430 --> 00:24:35.980
for universities who
are pursuing this study,

00:24:35.980 --> 00:24:38.670
and for anybody that's really
interested, for all those who

00:24:38.670 --> 00:24:42.394
are here who are
interested in this study.

00:24:42.394 --> 00:24:44.310
I think the first thing
that's important to do

00:24:44.310 --> 00:24:48.192
is not to limit the study of
enslavement to enslavement.

00:24:48.192 --> 00:24:49.650
And that is really,
really, really,

00:24:49.650 --> 00:24:52.650
really, really important.

00:24:52.650 --> 00:24:55.470
Enslavement is the
originating system of plunder,

00:24:55.470 --> 00:24:58.470
but it birthed all sorts
of other systems of plunder

00:24:58.470 --> 00:25:00.920
that haunt us up
until this very day.

00:25:00.920 --> 00:25:03.850
And I want to be really clear
about this, when we talk about,

00:25:03.850 --> 00:25:07.090
say the era of Jim Crow
segregation that obviously

00:25:07.090 --> 00:25:09.700
comes directly out
of enslavement.

00:25:09.700 --> 00:25:12.700
Often times, we find
ourselves appealing

00:25:12.700 --> 00:25:16.210
to very sentimental language.

00:25:16.210 --> 00:25:19.960
We picture enslavement,
excuse me not enslavement,

00:25:19.960 --> 00:25:23.350
segregation as simply the
right of white and black people

00:25:23.350 --> 00:25:27.369
not to sit next to each other
as they are in this room today.

00:25:27.369 --> 00:25:29.160
And the thing I always
try to remind people

00:25:29.160 --> 00:25:32.120
is that segregation is plunder.

00:25:32.120 --> 00:25:35.130
It's taking from
somebody else to benefit

00:25:35.130 --> 00:25:37.020
another group of people.

00:25:37.020 --> 00:25:40.650
It is the act of
putting folks into a box

00:25:40.650 --> 00:25:43.530
so that you can better and
more efficiently rob them.

00:25:43.530 --> 00:25:51.430
If you are living in Mississippi
in 1940 and you're being taxed,

00:25:51.430 --> 00:25:53.730
and there's a public university
that you cannot attend,

00:25:53.730 --> 00:25:56.080
you are being plundered.

00:25:56.080 --> 00:25:59.950
If you are living in
Alabama, and you're being

00:25:59.950 --> 00:26:01.390
taxed for a school system.

00:26:01.390 --> 00:26:04.210
And you don't have the full
access to that school system

00:26:04.210 --> 00:26:08.070
that everyone else does,
you're being plundered.

00:26:08.070 --> 00:26:11.520
If you are living
in Georgia in 1950,

00:26:11.520 --> 00:26:15.940
and you can't go to the
public swimming pools,

00:26:15.940 --> 00:26:17.786
the way other citizens
can, and you're

00:26:17.786 --> 00:26:19.660
being taxed-- even if
you're not being taxed,

00:26:19.660 --> 00:26:21.670
I would argue, by right
of social contract--

00:26:21.670 --> 00:26:23.080
you're being plundered.

00:26:23.080 --> 00:26:25.420
Somebody is taking from you.

00:26:25.420 --> 00:26:27.520
And we can take this
out across the board.

00:26:27.520 --> 00:26:29.950
I did my own piece in "The
Case for Reparations,"

00:26:29.950 --> 00:26:32.530
looking at the housing
conditions in the North

00:26:32.530 --> 00:26:34.240
and rooting the case in that.

00:26:34.240 --> 00:26:37.770
But the point is to recognize
that the plunder of slavery,

00:26:37.770 --> 00:26:41.311
the plunder of enslavement
does not end with enslavement.

00:26:41.311 --> 00:26:43.060
And those of us who
are interested in that

00:26:43.060 --> 00:26:46.750
are charged with
looking past that.

00:26:46.750 --> 00:26:49.217
I keep using this word plunder.

00:26:49.217 --> 00:26:50.800
And I think my second
suggestion would

00:26:50.800 --> 00:26:53.951
be it's very, very important
to talk about it in that way.

00:26:53.951 --> 00:26:56.450
Well, one of the things that
happened, and maybe not so much

00:26:56.450 --> 00:26:59.980
here, but definitely in
the grander conversation.

00:26:59.980 --> 00:27:03.800
Racism in this country is
seen as a misunderstanding.

00:27:03.800 --> 00:27:06.830
Or somehow just like bad
manners or something.

00:27:06.830 --> 00:27:10.110
One group of people was impolite
to another group of people.

00:27:10.110 --> 00:27:11.057
It wasn't nice enough.

00:27:11.057 --> 00:27:12.140
We should have been nicer.

00:27:12.140 --> 00:27:14.240
We could have looked
into each other's heart.

00:27:14.240 --> 00:27:17.691
We could have been nicer.

00:27:17.691 --> 00:27:19.190
From time to time
when I speak, I'll

00:27:19.190 --> 00:27:22.632
have someone in the
audience, especially when I'm

00:27:22.632 --> 00:27:24.090
talking about
reparations, when I'm

00:27:24.090 --> 00:27:25.640
talking about the Civil War.

00:27:25.640 --> 00:27:27.510
And at times there
will be somebody

00:27:27.510 --> 00:27:29.640
with roots in the South or
from the South directly.

00:27:29.640 --> 00:27:31.920
And they'll say my
great-great-great-grand such

00:27:31.920 --> 00:27:33.579
and such, you know,
was a Southerner.

00:27:33.579 --> 00:27:34.870
But they didn't own any slaves.

00:27:34.870 --> 00:27:36.286
What does this
have to do with me?

00:27:36.286 --> 00:27:40.550
And I would tell them repeatedly
that that may be true.

00:27:40.550 --> 00:27:43.510
But I assure you your
great-great-grand such and such

00:27:43.510 --> 00:27:46.820
wanted to own slaves.

00:27:46.820 --> 00:27:49.464
And that's because
enslavement was a system.

00:27:49.464 --> 00:27:50.130
It was a system.

00:27:50.130 --> 00:27:52.340
It wasn't about being nice.

00:27:52.340 --> 00:27:53.840
It was about structures.

00:27:53.840 --> 00:27:56.030
It was about the way
things were set up

00:27:56.030 --> 00:28:00.872
to benefit one class of
people to the detriment

00:28:00.872 --> 00:28:01.580
of another class.

00:28:01.580 --> 00:28:03.380
And it's very,
very, very important

00:28:03.380 --> 00:28:06.500
to understand the
intentionality of it.

00:28:10.084 --> 00:28:12.890
To not speak of it in such a
way as though it was outside

00:28:12.890 --> 00:28:16.820
of our hands, that it
was an actual done thing.

00:28:16.820 --> 00:28:18.295
The third thing
is pretty obvious.

00:28:20.844 --> 00:28:22.760
I think every single one
of these universities

00:28:22.760 --> 00:28:25.310
needs to make reparations.

00:28:25.310 --> 00:28:26.655
I think there's just no way.

00:28:26.655 --> 00:28:35.849
[APPLAUSE] I don't know
how you get around that.

00:28:35.849 --> 00:28:36.390
I just don't.

00:28:36.390 --> 00:28:41.380
I don't know how
you conduct research

00:28:41.380 --> 00:28:43.950
that shows that your
very existence is

00:28:43.950 --> 00:28:47.300
rooted in a great crime.

00:28:47.300 --> 00:28:50.240
And you just say, well, shrug.

00:28:50.240 --> 00:28:53.160
And maybe at best say, I'm
sorry, and you walk away.

00:28:53.160 --> 00:28:55.985
And I think you need to use
the language of reparation.

00:28:55.985 --> 00:28:57.360
I think it's very,
very important

00:28:57.360 --> 00:28:58.980
to actually say that word.

00:28:58.980 --> 00:29:01.280
To acknowledge that
something was done.

00:29:01.280 --> 00:29:03.810
And these institutions, some
of the most elite institutions

00:29:03.810 --> 00:29:09.500
in our country, are taking
active or effective action

00:29:09.500 --> 00:29:10.790
to make good on that.

00:29:10.790 --> 00:29:13.580
I think it's extremely,
extremely, extremely important

00:29:13.580 --> 00:29:14.901
to do.

00:29:14.901 --> 00:29:16.900
I don't want to go so far
as to say the research

00:29:16.900 --> 00:29:18.830
is for naught if
that doesn't happen.

00:29:22.340 --> 00:29:26.030
Listen, as a
country, we recognize

00:29:26.030 --> 00:29:28.160
that our history is important.

00:29:28.160 --> 00:29:30.890
And we recognize that our place
in the world and our place

00:29:30.890 --> 00:29:34.670
in history comes because of the
sacrifices and the great deeds

00:29:34.670 --> 00:29:35.660
of our forefathers.

00:29:35.660 --> 00:29:37.550
That's why we have
a Presidents' Day.

00:29:37.550 --> 00:29:39.350
That's why we have
a 4th of July.

00:29:39.350 --> 00:29:40.230
We say thanks.

00:29:40.230 --> 00:29:42.560
We recognize the
importance of history.

00:29:42.560 --> 00:29:44.780
We're big on taking a
moment to say thanks.

00:29:44.780 --> 00:29:48.410
I just think it works
the other way, also.

00:29:48.410 --> 00:29:50.780
I think when you stand on
the backs of other people

00:29:50.780 --> 00:29:54.250
who have been exploited, you
have to in a moral sense,

00:29:54.250 --> 00:29:56.180
as any sort of
institution that wants

00:29:56.180 --> 00:29:58.707
to teach young people
about morals and ethics,

00:29:58.707 --> 00:30:00.290
you have to do the
right thing and try

00:30:00.290 --> 00:30:02.390
to make some amends for that.

00:30:02.390 --> 00:30:05.744
I just don't know how
you get around that.

00:30:05.744 --> 00:30:07.160
I don't, in the
fourth suggestion,

00:30:07.160 --> 00:30:10.490
think it's enough for
these universities

00:30:10.490 --> 00:30:13.100
actually to make
reparations themselves.

00:30:13.100 --> 00:30:15.150
I think they need to
urge other institutions

00:30:15.150 --> 00:30:18.710
throughout this country
also to make reparations.

00:30:18.710 --> 00:30:21.470
I think being here at
a place like Harvard,

00:30:21.470 --> 00:30:24.500
or being at a Yale or
being at a Princeton

00:30:24.500 --> 00:30:27.980
or being at a Georgetown, you're
talking about institutions

00:30:27.980 --> 00:30:29.990
that effectively
birthed the leadership

00:30:29.990 --> 00:30:32.730
class in this country.

00:30:32.730 --> 00:30:36.960
I can remember a time when
words like reparations--

00:30:36.960 --> 00:30:38.760
and maybe even still
to an extent today,

00:30:38.760 --> 00:30:40.740
but I think less so today--

00:30:40.740 --> 00:30:44.910
was seen as like some sort of
cockamamie, crazy eyed thing,

00:30:44.910 --> 00:30:49.980
like you had just suggested
human sacrifice or something.

00:30:49.980 --> 00:30:50.940
That's less so today.

00:30:50.940 --> 00:30:52.690
It's still a little
bit, but it's less so.

00:30:52.690 --> 00:30:55.690
And I think these institutions
have a responsibility

00:30:55.690 --> 00:30:58.720
to help make the
conversation respectable.

00:30:58.720 --> 00:31:00.460
Because it deserves
to be respectable.

00:31:00.460 --> 00:31:01.870
It deserves to be respectable.

00:31:01.870 --> 00:31:03.789
Reparations is not
even an alien concept.

00:31:03.789 --> 00:31:05.330
Once I was on the
radio with this guy

00:31:05.330 --> 00:31:08.640
who was objecting to this
language of reparations.

00:31:08.640 --> 00:31:12.730
And I asked him, I said do you
oppose the reparations that

00:31:12.730 --> 00:31:16.604
were signed by President Ronald
Reagan for the internment

00:31:16.604 --> 00:31:17.520
of Japanese-Americans?

00:31:17.520 --> 00:31:19.800
Do you really oppose that?

00:31:19.800 --> 00:31:21.160
No, no, no, I don't oppose that.

00:31:21.160 --> 00:31:23.770
I said, how then
could you oppose

00:31:23.770 --> 00:31:27.310
reparations for the crimes of
Jim Crow housing segregation.

00:31:27.310 --> 00:31:29.170
That was more recent.

00:31:29.170 --> 00:31:30.680
How can you actively
oppose that?

00:31:30.680 --> 00:31:33.610
And what I got to was
the hard part about this

00:31:33.610 --> 00:31:36.729
is the idea of giving
black people things.

00:31:36.729 --> 00:31:38.770
We're being seen as having
given-- they're really

00:31:38.770 --> 00:31:40.480
not giving anybody anything.

00:31:40.480 --> 00:31:44.190
For being seen as having
given black people things.

00:31:44.190 --> 00:31:45.440
That's just a brief diversion.

00:31:45.440 --> 00:31:46.180
I'm sorry.

00:31:46.180 --> 00:31:48.096
This has taken a little
longer than I thought.

00:31:48.096 --> 00:31:50.521
I'm going to get out
of your way real quick.

00:31:50.521 --> 00:31:52.520
You know sometimes I get
in these conversations,

00:31:52.520 --> 00:31:55.200
and people say, well, why
can't we see our past,

00:31:55.200 --> 00:31:59.290
and see our history in
the way that Germany has

00:31:59.290 --> 00:32:01.420
come to grips with its history.

00:32:01.420 --> 00:32:03.880
And if you go
throughout Germany,

00:32:03.880 --> 00:32:07.240
you can see that it's this
very, very real reminder

00:32:07.240 --> 00:32:08.740
of everything that
happened there.

00:32:08.740 --> 00:32:12.180
And I tell them,
yeah, but see Germany

00:32:12.180 --> 00:32:15.010
killed the vast majority of
Jews who were living there.

00:32:15.010 --> 00:32:17.250
They're not alive as an
active political force.

00:32:17.250 --> 00:32:19.670
The problem is black
people are still here.

00:32:19.670 --> 00:32:22.630
They're an active force
who can actually do things.

00:32:22.630 --> 00:32:25.030
So I think if
anything that hampers

00:32:25.030 --> 00:32:27.690
the fight for reparations
as much as anything.

00:32:27.690 --> 00:32:29.440
Having said that, I
really, really believe

00:32:29.440 --> 00:32:31.680
it really is up
to the leadership

00:32:31.680 --> 00:32:35.430
gathered here today to help
the broader country come

00:32:35.430 --> 00:32:39.010
to understand the struggle,
and to force, if not force,

00:32:39.010 --> 00:32:43.014
can we say coerce, can we
say coax, other institutions

00:32:43.014 --> 00:32:45.180
throughout this country to
do this sort of research.

00:32:45.180 --> 00:32:48.498
And to try to think
about what they owe.

00:32:48.498 --> 00:32:53.980
The last thing I
would say is listen

00:32:53.980 --> 00:32:56.540
and don't be
self-congratulatory,

00:32:56.540 --> 00:32:58.190
and don't get too mad.

00:32:58.190 --> 00:33:00.710
Because people are
going to be mad at you.

00:33:00.710 --> 00:33:04.270
And I would submit, they will
be mad at you for good reason.

00:33:04.270 --> 00:33:06.260
Reparations is
not a new concept.

00:33:06.260 --> 00:33:09.460
It's not even so much that
I, myself, in my writing

00:33:09.460 --> 00:33:11.140
didn't come up with the concept.

00:33:11.140 --> 00:33:14.997
The folks in the '80s and
'90s who were lobbying for it

00:33:14.997 --> 00:33:16.330
didn't come up with the concept.

00:33:16.330 --> 00:33:18.820
In the '60s, it doesn't
have its origins there.

00:33:18.820 --> 00:33:21.920
This goes back to Belinda Royal.

00:33:21.920 --> 00:33:26.050
We've been fighting this
since the 18th century.

00:33:26.050 --> 00:33:28.660
And so there's a lot
of pent up anger.

00:33:28.660 --> 00:33:31.531
A lot of that is going to
be directed at you guys.

00:33:31.531 --> 00:33:34.030
I'm sorry about that, but one
of the worst things you can do

00:33:34.030 --> 00:33:37.184
is just retreat into
yourself, into your shell.

00:33:37.184 --> 00:33:39.100
Doesn't mean you have
to take every suggestion

00:33:39.100 --> 00:33:41.950
from every crazy person
that comes up to you.

00:33:41.950 --> 00:33:42.992
But you've got to listen.

00:33:42.992 --> 00:33:45.325
You've got to listen, and
you've got to hear that anger.

00:33:45.325 --> 00:33:46.750
It comes from a
deep, deep place.

00:33:46.750 --> 00:33:51.050
somewhere deep in our hearts,
even if we don't always

00:33:51.050 --> 00:33:52.510
acknowledge it.

00:33:52.510 --> 00:33:58.010
All of us know on some emotional
level that we were robbed.

00:33:58.010 --> 00:34:00.350
And that we've been the victims
of generational robbery.

00:34:00.350 --> 00:34:03.290
Now we don't always have
the intellectual tools

00:34:03.290 --> 00:34:06.752
that historians here, and the
academics, and the sociologists

00:34:06.752 --> 00:34:08.460
and the political
scientists have helped,

00:34:08.460 --> 00:34:11.389
and I give all praise
for this, to assemble.

00:34:11.389 --> 00:34:14.130
So that we can understand
specifically how that happened.

00:34:14.130 --> 00:34:16.231
But we know it in our heart.

00:34:16.231 --> 00:34:17.730
So when you interact
with people you

00:34:17.730 --> 00:34:19.892
might feel a little bit of that.

00:34:19.892 --> 00:34:21.600
OK, I'm going to give
up this microphone.

00:34:21.600 --> 00:34:24.570
Because I look very, very much
forward to talking to [? Joy ?]

00:34:24.570 --> 00:34:25.900
and having this conversation.

00:34:25.900 --> 00:34:27.077
Thank you so much guys.

00:34:27.077 --> 00:34:37.511
[APPLAUSE]

00:34:37.511 --> 00:34:38.011
- Thank you.

00:34:38.011 --> 00:34:39.005
- [INAUDIBLE]

00:34:39.005 --> 00:34:41.110
- [INAUDIBLE] Thank
you, Ta-Nehisi.

00:34:41.110 --> 00:34:42.260
- Thanks for having me.

00:34:42.260 --> 00:34:44.690
- It's great to have you here.

00:34:44.690 --> 00:34:45.610
I would gush, but--

00:34:45.610 --> 00:34:47.020
- [LAUGHS]

00:34:47.020 --> 00:34:48.883
- at you, but I'll refrain.

00:34:48.883 --> 00:34:52.540
But thank you for the kind
words about our scholarship

00:34:52.540 --> 00:34:56.020
collectively and
about the work that

00:34:56.020 --> 00:35:01.360
gets done that you have
put to such good use.

00:35:01.360 --> 00:35:06.040
Very challenging talk
with a kind of call

00:35:06.040 --> 00:35:08.740
to action for this group.

00:35:08.740 --> 00:35:11.440
And I wanted to start with
the history part of it.

00:35:11.440 --> 00:35:15.010
And I've always been
interested in how,

00:35:15.010 --> 00:35:17.530
really through the
notion of plunder,

00:35:17.530 --> 00:35:20.350
you situate your
analyses in history.

00:35:20.350 --> 00:35:23.200
But they really come right up
to the present, the reparations

00:35:23.200 --> 00:35:29.420
article with its discussion of
housing policy and so forth.

00:35:29.420 --> 00:35:33.470
So how do you see the
differential emphasis?

00:35:33.470 --> 00:35:36.400
I mean should we be
talking more about today?

00:35:36.400 --> 00:35:38.410
Or is it all of a piece?

00:35:38.410 --> 00:35:43.810
And how do we understand plunder
that people are experiencing

00:35:43.810 --> 00:35:46.210
at this very moment
through the growing

00:35:46.210 --> 00:35:48.400
inequality in our
society, so much

00:35:48.400 --> 00:35:52.240
of what the recent political
discourse has been focused on?

00:35:52.240 --> 00:35:55.240
And how much do we
focus on origins of it,

00:35:55.240 --> 00:35:56.800
or are they inseparable?

00:35:56.800 --> 00:35:58.300
And how do you think
about that when

00:35:58.300 --> 00:36:00.580
you're doing your own writing
and your own inquiries?

00:36:00.580 --> 00:36:03.820
- So when I wrote "The
Case for Reparations,"

00:36:03.820 --> 00:36:06.340
there were a number of
people, Sandy Darity

00:36:06.340 --> 00:36:08.200
down at Duke, for
instance, who had

00:36:08.200 --> 00:36:11.950
done a pretty thorough
scholarship on the concept.

00:36:11.950 --> 00:36:13.617
And one of the most
interesting pieces--

00:36:13.617 --> 00:36:15.408
and I can't even remember
where I read this

00:36:15.408 --> 00:36:17.980
and I came across it-- the
notion that actually this

00:36:17.980 --> 00:36:19.960
does not, this conversation
does not in any way

00:36:19.960 --> 00:36:21.490
have to be confined
to enslavement.

00:36:21.490 --> 00:36:23.784
For instance,
housing segregation

00:36:23.784 --> 00:36:24.700
could be talked about.

00:36:24.700 --> 00:36:25.810
And that piqued me.

00:36:25.810 --> 00:36:28.430
But it piqued me, obviously,
as a piece of knowledge,

00:36:28.430 --> 00:36:30.160
but as a journalist.

00:36:30.160 --> 00:36:34.140
Because as a
journalist, I thought A,

00:36:34.140 --> 00:36:38.290
if I'm going to
convince my magazine

00:36:38.290 --> 00:36:39.970
to do something
like this and to put

00:36:39.970 --> 00:36:42.519
the weight and the resources
behind it to make the case,

00:36:42.519 --> 00:36:44.560
because if you're going
to argue for reparations,

00:36:44.560 --> 00:36:46.690
you can't do a 800
word column and say,

00:36:46.690 --> 00:36:48.590
I think this is a good idea.

00:36:48.590 --> 00:36:52.150
You know you have to have
the full weight of the thing

00:36:52.150 --> 00:36:54.100
that a magazine
like The Atlantic

00:36:54.100 --> 00:36:56.350
usually brings and
maybe a little bit more

00:36:56.350 --> 00:36:57.490
brought to bear.

00:36:57.490 --> 00:37:01.540
And so it was very, very
important for me to A,

00:37:01.540 --> 00:37:04.300
find somebody who was
alive, who I actually could

00:37:04.300 --> 00:37:05.680
make the case on their behalf.

00:37:05.680 --> 00:37:08.500
So that you could immediately
get past the notion,

00:37:08.500 --> 00:37:10.600
that sort of popular
idea, which I don't even

00:37:10.600 --> 00:37:12.266
know if it's sufficient,
but it's always

00:37:12.266 --> 00:37:15.130
raised-- that, oh, these
people have been long dead.

00:37:15.130 --> 00:37:16.760
But when I wrote
the piece I said,

00:37:16.760 --> 00:37:18.010
OK, we're going to start here.

00:37:18.010 --> 00:37:20.440
But you do ultimately have
to go back to slavery,

00:37:20.440 --> 00:37:23.640
because you have to
understand how it happened.

00:37:23.640 --> 00:37:26.920
So I don't think there's a
way of getting around it.

00:37:26.920 --> 00:37:30.160
I do think though, that if
you remain too focused there,

00:37:30.160 --> 00:37:33.250
people just dismiss
it out of hand.

00:37:33.250 --> 00:37:37.480
They aren't able to see how this
thing redounded across history.

00:37:37.480 --> 00:37:39.930
And you know for me, the
most disturbing part of it

00:37:39.930 --> 00:37:43.090
is every time you
don't do something,

00:37:43.090 --> 00:37:44.710
every time you
don't talk about it,

00:37:44.710 --> 00:37:47.041
it just burrows
further and further

00:37:47.041 --> 00:37:48.040
and further and further.

00:37:48.040 --> 00:37:51.550
And such to the point that
you're at those incarceration

00:37:51.550 --> 00:37:53.440
numbers I cited.

00:37:53.440 --> 00:37:58.060
That very much is the
legacy of enslavement.

00:37:58.060 --> 00:38:02.530
People have remained within
a class across generations

00:38:02.530 --> 00:38:07.600
and subject to certain forces
across generations because

00:38:07.600 --> 00:38:09.670
of enslavement, because
the policies that

00:38:09.670 --> 00:38:12.624
came after enslavement, because
of policies that came after,

00:38:12.624 --> 00:38:13.540
after the enslavement.

00:38:13.540 --> 00:38:14.470
But it's all linked.

00:38:14.470 --> 00:38:17.200
It's like a chain in effect.

00:38:17.200 --> 00:38:22.540
And my great fear really is
that if this is not dealt with,

00:38:22.540 --> 00:38:25.100
this will mark us for
our whole history.

00:38:25.100 --> 00:38:26.050
It's that deep.

00:38:26.050 --> 00:38:26.890
It's that profound.

00:38:26.890 --> 00:38:29.910
It's that threatening.

00:38:29.910 --> 00:38:33.780
- I sometimes am
struck by a sense

00:38:33.780 --> 00:38:37.830
of history's importance because
of the desire to avoid it.

00:38:37.830 --> 00:38:40.440
I think about the
brouhaha that erupted

00:38:40.440 --> 00:38:44.280
when Michelle Obama
said my children grew up

00:38:44.280 --> 00:38:47.010
in the White House, which
was built by slaves.

00:38:47.010 --> 00:38:49.320
And that was not
allowed to mention,

00:38:49.320 --> 00:38:52.710
that there was so much push
back about that comment.

00:38:52.710 --> 00:38:55.920
And so it's as if
people who may not

00:38:55.920 --> 00:38:59.842
know any history, affirmatively
don't want to know history

00:38:59.842 --> 00:39:01.050
because they're afraid of it.

00:39:01.050 --> 00:39:04.290
So how do we deal with
that, the resistance

00:39:04.290 --> 00:39:06.180
to teaching slavery
in the schools

00:39:06.180 --> 00:39:10.350
because it's awkward to talk
about, the resistance when

00:39:10.350 --> 00:39:12.720
the National Park Service
started bringing slavery

00:39:12.720 --> 00:39:15.480
into the interpretation
of sites, civil war

00:39:15.480 --> 00:39:16.425
sites and other sites.

00:39:19.020 --> 00:39:21.350
Is it through things
like The Atlantic?

00:39:21.350 --> 00:39:23.610
Is it academics?

00:39:23.610 --> 00:39:25.099
What breaks down
that resistance?

00:39:25.099 --> 00:39:27.140
- I think the first thing
you have to recognize--

00:39:27.140 --> 00:39:29.970
you're not going
to get everybody.

00:39:29.970 --> 00:39:32.820
As you said, there are people
who are affirmatively ignorant.

00:39:32.820 --> 00:39:36.390
You know, it's not merely
that I don't want to know.

00:39:36.390 --> 00:39:41.420
It's like my whole identity
is staked on me not knowing.

00:39:41.420 --> 00:39:43.570
And I don't know that you
can-- that's beyond you.

00:39:43.570 --> 00:39:46.510
That's for that person to
decide what they're going to do.

00:39:46.510 --> 00:39:48.060
But in the middle
of that, again, I

00:39:48.060 --> 00:39:54.780
considered myself circa 2008
a reasonably well-read person.

00:39:54.780 --> 00:39:57.309
I had at that point been a
journalist for about 12 years.

00:39:57.309 --> 00:39:58.850
I had written quite
a bit about race.

00:39:58.850 --> 00:39:59.730
But the amount that--

00:39:59.730 --> 00:40:05.120
I'm kind of ashamed,
to be honest.

00:40:05.120 --> 00:40:08.840
And so I think actually there
are many, many more people

00:40:08.840 --> 00:40:10.460
who are gettable.

00:40:12.925 --> 00:40:15.050
Again, when I published
"The Case for Reparations,"

00:40:15.050 --> 00:40:17.862
I can't tell you how many
people came up to me and said,

00:40:17.862 --> 00:40:19.070
I had never heard of redline.

00:40:19.070 --> 00:40:21.860
I mean white people saying,
I didn't know this happened.

00:40:21.860 --> 00:40:24.360
I mean this is a policy I've
seen in every major city.

00:40:24.360 --> 00:40:26.568
You can literally go on
Google right now and find it.

00:40:26.568 --> 00:40:28.990
It's not a matter of information
being hard to access.

00:40:28.990 --> 00:40:29.490
It's clear.

00:40:29.490 --> 00:40:31.850
It's not buried
away in archives.

00:40:31.850 --> 00:40:35.030
It's actually very,
very easily accessible.

00:40:35.030 --> 00:40:36.560
But folks just didn't know.

00:40:36.560 --> 00:40:39.950
I do think that we may be at
somewhat of an advantage right

00:40:39.950 --> 00:40:41.320
now.

00:40:41.320 --> 00:40:43.707
Because in the era of the
internet, and I know internet

00:40:43.707 --> 00:40:44.790
has all sorts of problems.

00:40:44.790 --> 00:40:46.720
Social media has all
sorts of problems.

00:40:46.720 --> 00:40:49.130
But the swiftness with which
you can access information,

00:40:49.130 --> 00:40:50.331
and just say here it is.

00:40:50.331 --> 00:40:50.830
Here it is.

00:40:50.830 --> 00:40:52.496
You don't have to
wait on this monograph

00:40:52.496 --> 00:40:53.460
to arrive in two weeks.

00:40:53.460 --> 00:40:53.970
It's right here.

00:40:53.970 --> 00:40:55.210
We have the map right there.

00:40:55.210 --> 00:40:58.030
That's what it says right there.

00:40:58.030 --> 00:40:59.710
So I think what's
important is to get

00:40:59.710 --> 00:41:02.920
a critical mass of people.

00:41:02.920 --> 00:41:06.154
I think it's also important
to think long term,

00:41:06.154 --> 00:41:07.570
to think about
fights that may not

00:41:07.570 --> 00:41:10.720
be solved in our lifetime,
that may not be solved

00:41:10.720 --> 00:41:13.900
in our children's lifetime.

00:41:13.900 --> 00:41:16.900
There may well be a sense
giving the current politics

00:41:16.900 --> 00:41:21.010
of this country to move away
from fights because they barely

00:41:21.010 --> 00:41:23.316
looked like they were
realizable during the previous

00:41:23.316 --> 00:41:23.940
administration.

00:41:23.940 --> 00:41:26.410
They certainly don't look
like they are realizable now.

00:41:26.410 --> 00:41:29.090
But I think you have to realize
this is a long, long fight.

00:41:29.090 --> 00:41:31.390
Like I said it's been going
on since Belinda Royal.

00:41:31.390 --> 00:41:34.150
Who are you to drop your
weapons right now and say,

00:41:34.150 --> 00:41:35.770
OK, I can't deal.

00:41:35.770 --> 00:41:38.680
So I think it's important
to keep those ideas alive.

00:41:38.680 --> 00:41:40.840
- You know I think
about the phrase you

00:41:40.840 --> 00:41:43.300
used a few minutes
ago, when you said

00:41:43.300 --> 00:41:46.390
it isn't a bump in the
road, it's the road.

00:41:46.390 --> 00:41:51.040
I think that's part of the
effort to deny this history,

00:41:51.040 --> 00:41:53.080
is to say, oh, that's
just a bump in the road.

00:41:53.080 --> 00:41:58.030
So to establish the
roadness of this history is,

00:41:58.030 --> 00:42:00.790
it seems to me, an
important step that

00:42:00.790 --> 00:42:06.580
has to be taken in order to
have the necessity, urgency

00:42:06.580 --> 00:42:07.497
of this understanding.

00:42:07.497 --> 00:42:09.413
Otherwise, you can just
say, oh, that was just

00:42:09.413 --> 00:42:11.260
something we should
teach about, something

00:42:11.260 --> 00:42:13.060
we don't need to think about.

00:42:13.060 --> 00:42:14.060
- I agree.

00:42:14.060 --> 00:42:14.560
I agree.

00:42:14.560 --> 00:42:18.840
And again, I mean
the scope of it--

00:42:18.840 --> 00:42:21.180
I don't think people
realize, for instance,

00:42:21.180 --> 00:42:25.110
that in 1860, most of
the people living in say,

00:42:25.110 --> 00:42:28.637
South Carolina or Mississippi,
were literally property.

00:42:28.637 --> 00:42:29.970
That was the most of the people.

00:42:29.970 --> 00:42:32.220
That you can't really talk
about any sort of democracy

00:42:32.220 --> 00:42:34.980
at all in that
sort of situation.

00:42:34.980 --> 00:42:39.270
That half the people, in
say a place like Georgia.

00:42:39.270 --> 00:42:41.220
I don't think people--
like the scope of it.

00:42:41.220 --> 00:42:44.800
And then they don't quite get
how much money [INAUDIBLE]

00:42:44.800 --> 00:42:47.050
actually was even though
[? there were all sorts of ?]

00:42:47.050 --> 00:42:49.320
[? commerce ?] actually
making off of it.

00:42:49.320 --> 00:42:51.360
And I think also part of
this, and honestly I'm

00:42:51.360 --> 00:42:54.480
just dipping my toe in this
myself to understand this,

00:42:54.480 --> 00:42:57.690
they don't understand how
much, like how the entire West,

00:42:57.690 --> 00:43:01.520
modern West is not really
understandable without it.

00:43:01.520 --> 00:43:02.240
They just don't.

00:43:02.240 --> 00:43:04.540
And like in a global
sense, it's very hard.

00:43:04.540 --> 00:43:07.540
And one of the things
it brings to me

00:43:07.540 --> 00:43:11.500
is a more philosophical
question of

00:43:11.500 --> 00:43:16.240
is it possible for human
societies, for states,

00:43:16.240 --> 00:43:18.630
to acknowledge these
sorts of things?

00:43:18.630 --> 00:43:20.239
Is the blindness--

00:43:20.239 --> 00:43:22.780
I'm going out there right now--
but is the blindness actually

00:43:22.780 --> 00:43:25.360
kind of necessary?

00:43:25.360 --> 00:43:27.010
Because I don't
think human societies

00:43:27.010 --> 00:43:29.759
have ever been particularly good
at documenting their crimes.

00:43:29.759 --> 00:43:32.050
And when you're talking about
a crime that wasn't just,

00:43:32.050 --> 00:43:33.924
again, a bump on the
road, but something that

00:43:33.924 --> 00:43:36.999
made you possible.

00:43:36.999 --> 00:43:37.540
That's tough.

00:43:37.540 --> 00:43:39.456
But then again, we say
we're exceptional, so--

00:43:42.862 --> 00:43:44.320
- As you say that,
how do you think

00:43:44.320 --> 00:43:47.770
about efforts that might be
seen as analogous to the one

00:43:47.770 --> 00:43:49.240
you're asking for.

00:43:49.240 --> 00:43:52.900
Do you think Germany
has faced its past--

00:43:52.900 --> 00:43:53.860
[INTERPOSING VOICES]

00:43:53.860 --> 00:43:58.980
- Again, if you
destroy the people

00:43:58.980 --> 00:44:01.450
or the majority of the people,
the vast majority of people.

00:44:01.450 --> 00:44:02.890
And then you say, I'm sorry.

00:44:02.890 --> 00:44:07.450
But the people aren't there as
an active political presence,

00:44:07.450 --> 00:44:08.560
you know?

00:44:08.560 --> 00:44:11.200
And we should be really, really
clear about we're asking for.

00:44:11.200 --> 00:44:15.130
To acknowledge this, I mean
it puts tremendous weight

00:44:15.130 --> 00:44:16.930
on institutions.

00:44:16.930 --> 00:44:20.670
If you understand that
the White House was

00:44:20.670 --> 00:44:23.520
built by enslaved
people, if you understand

00:44:23.520 --> 00:44:29.874
that the Mall was built
by enslaved people,

00:44:29.874 --> 00:44:31.540
you take a different
view, for instance,

00:44:31.540 --> 00:44:33.850
of statehood for Washington, DC.

00:44:33.850 --> 00:44:35.860
Those sorts of things,
like it throws a light.

00:44:35.860 --> 00:44:39.040
It makes that very,
very, very uncomfortable.

00:44:39.040 --> 00:44:42.220
And you start to understand,
is it a mere coincidence

00:44:42.220 --> 00:44:44.930
that this majority
black capital city has

00:44:44.930 --> 00:44:46.180
no representation in Congress?

00:44:46.180 --> 00:44:48.460
Is that a coincidence?

00:44:48.460 --> 00:44:49.550
Or is something going on?

00:44:49.550 --> 00:44:54.910
So it disturbs like all sorts
of other attendant myths

00:44:54.910 --> 00:44:57.790
and realities in a
way that, if you've

00:44:57.790 --> 00:45:01.700
murdered the vast majority of
that populace, it does not.

00:45:01.700 --> 00:45:02.680
What can we do now?

00:45:02.680 --> 00:45:04.720
Washington, DC is no
longer majority black, oh,

00:45:04.720 --> 00:45:06.491
well, sorry about that.

00:45:06.491 --> 00:45:08.490
I think the difference
is that you have to act--

00:45:08.490 --> 00:45:11.090
and I suspect it was the
same for-- to a lesser,

00:45:11.090 --> 00:45:13.090
in a different way, but
for the reparations that

00:45:13.090 --> 00:45:14.960
was made on behalf of
Japanese-Americans.

00:45:14.960 --> 00:45:17.800
It wasn't the sheer numbers.

00:45:17.800 --> 00:45:20.260
This is a country that
had a black president.

00:45:20.260 --> 00:45:23.240
You know largely,
well, not entirely,

00:45:23.240 --> 00:45:25.870
through the voting
strength of black people.

00:45:25.870 --> 00:45:29.620
So African-Americans, and we
sometimes don't quite grasp it,

00:45:29.620 --> 00:45:32.460
but they're a very
potent political force

00:45:32.460 --> 00:45:33.460
in this country.

00:45:33.460 --> 00:45:35.710
Not omnipotent, but a
very, very potent force.

00:45:35.710 --> 00:45:38.080
And so the notion that
you would hand over

00:45:38.080 --> 00:45:41.430
more power to that force, I
think is very, very disturbing

00:45:41.430 --> 00:45:43.730
to people.

00:45:43.730 --> 00:45:45.230
- So that is not
an [? analogy. ?]

00:45:45.230 --> 00:45:48.500
I think the notion of
system is so important here.

00:45:48.500 --> 00:45:51.140
When I used to teach a
course on the Old South,

00:45:51.140 --> 00:45:53.580
I always talked about
how it was a system.

00:45:53.580 --> 00:45:59.360
So you had to understand white
family relations, policing,

00:45:59.360 --> 00:46:03.420
everything based on the
presence of substantial 4

00:46:03.420 --> 00:46:06.380
million numbers of unfree
people in that society.

00:46:06.380 --> 00:46:09.090
So to understand those
connections does seem to me

00:46:09.090 --> 00:46:10.802
critical, because
it does define.

00:46:10.802 --> 00:46:12.260
It does enable you
to ask questions

00:46:12.260 --> 00:46:15.250
about what else, what else--

00:46:15.250 --> 00:46:17.600
- And I think like
part of it is like--

00:46:17.600 --> 00:46:21.860
I think maybe our artists
bear some responsibility here.

00:46:21.860 --> 00:46:23.390
We're getting better about this.

00:46:23.390 --> 00:46:27.000
But I think depictions
of the South, obviously.

00:46:27.000 --> 00:46:28.500
I mean, this is
obvious to you guys.

00:46:28.500 --> 00:46:32.270
But depictions of the
South, the antebellum South

00:46:32.270 --> 00:46:35.107
are part of why
people don't know.

00:46:35.107 --> 00:46:37.190
Is Gone with the Wind the
second most popular book

00:46:37.190 --> 00:46:37.856
after The Bible?

00:46:37.856 --> 00:46:40.530
I think it's some crazy--

00:46:40.530 --> 00:46:41.760
and that's not a mistake.

00:46:41.760 --> 00:46:42.590
You know, it's not a mistake.

00:46:42.590 --> 00:46:44.715
You think about film history
and Gone with the Wind

00:46:44.715 --> 00:46:47.810
being such a revolutionary film
and the most revolutionary film

00:46:47.810 --> 00:46:49.820
being Birth of a Nation.

00:46:49.820 --> 00:46:52.370
I mean, this is not a mistake.

00:46:52.370 --> 00:46:53.210
It's not a mistake.

00:46:53.210 --> 00:46:57.830
And so doing the work
of altering that.

00:46:57.830 --> 00:47:00.920
Altering how people see
themselves in the past

00:47:00.920 --> 00:47:02.720
through the arts, I
think is actually also

00:47:02.720 --> 00:47:04.237
really, really important.

00:47:04.237 --> 00:47:06.320
- I think another important
development in history

00:47:06.320 --> 00:47:10.100
over the past couple of
decades has been the growing

00:47:10.100 --> 00:47:12.920
acknowledgement in research
that is the foundation for that

00:47:12.920 --> 00:47:16.450
of the systematic presence
of slavery in the North.

00:47:16.450 --> 00:47:19.595
Because it was always the
great alibi for the North.

00:47:19.595 --> 00:47:22.190
As Robert Penn Warren put it,
oh, you were the bad ones,

00:47:22.190 --> 00:47:23.630
and we were free.

00:47:23.630 --> 00:47:26.989
And we're exempt, therefore the
nation in some sense is exempt.

00:47:26.989 --> 00:47:29.030
Because it was only that
little bump in the road.

00:47:29.030 --> 00:47:29.650
- It was sectional.

00:47:29.650 --> 00:47:30.780
- Yeah, it was sectional.

00:47:30.780 --> 00:47:32.720
So I think that's made
a real change, too.

00:47:32.720 --> 00:47:34.490
- Yeah, no, I agree.

00:47:34.490 --> 00:47:38.000
- Let me ask about the
concept of reparations

00:47:38.000 --> 00:47:40.220
and how you think about it.

00:47:40.220 --> 00:47:42.740
You have the article "The
Case for Reparations."

00:47:42.740 --> 00:47:44.240
Then you have another
article called

00:47:44.240 --> 00:47:47.841
"The Case for the
Consideration of Reparations."

00:47:47.841 --> 00:47:48.340
- I do?

00:47:48.340 --> 00:47:49.686
I don't even remember that.

00:47:49.686 --> 00:47:51.952
I'm sure it exists.

00:47:51.952 --> 00:47:53.910
- I'll be the great expert
on Ta-Nehisi Coates.

00:47:53.910 --> 00:47:54.438
[LAUGHTER]

00:47:54.438 --> 00:47:56.190
- And his oeuvre.

00:47:56.190 --> 00:47:59.550
But in that little
piece, it's much shorter

00:47:59.550 --> 00:48:03.540
than the other one, in case you
forgot, since you've forgot.

00:48:03.540 --> 00:48:07.350
But in it, you talk about the
importance of the discussion,

00:48:07.350 --> 00:48:08.990
as well as whatever outcome.

00:48:08.990 --> 00:48:11.210
And you shy away a
little bit from being

00:48:11.210 --> 00:48:13.730
specific about an outcome.

00:48:13.730 --> 00:48:18.380
So the word reparations, to
repair is the origin of it.

00:48:18.380 --> 00:48:20.540
How do we get to repair--

00:48:20.540 --> 00:48:23.690
to the place where
it is repaired?

00:48:23.690 --> 00:48:27.320
And is it the process
that gets us there?

00:48:27.320 --> 00:48:29.540
And you've been resistant
to say it should

00:48:29.540 --> 00:48:31.320
be x or y or this payment.

00:48:31.320 --> 00:48:33.800
- Yeah, yeah, and I have
because I think what people

00:48:33.800 --> 00:48:41.670
do is, in order to scuttle the
conversation, they say, well,

00:48:41.670 --> 00:48:43.684
how would it work?

00:48:43.684 --> 00:48:46.100
And then they want to have an
argument about how it works.

00:48:46.100 --> 00:48:49.284
And if you can't demonstrate
a full plan, then they say,

00:48:49.284 --> 00:48:51.200
well, we shouldn't even
have the conversation.

00:48:51.200 --> 00:48:54.500
But I think, and
I'm not speaking

00:48:54.500 --> 00:48:58.370
for actual academic
audiences or classrooms here,

00:48:58.370 --> 00:49:02.690
I think actually that is a
way to cover for the fact

00:49:02.690 --> 00:49:05.590
that people don't actually
want to talk about it.

00:49:05.590 --> 00:49:08.090
And the talk, I
think the barrier

00:49:08.090 --> 00:49:10.280
to reparations in
this country is not

00:49:10.280 --> 00:49:12.124
that there is not a
workable way to do it.

00:49:12.124 --> 00:49:13.540
And I really,
really believe this.

00:49:13.540 --> 00:49:14.960
The barrier is that
people don't want to pay.

00:49:14.960 --> 00:49:16.799
And they don't think
they should have to.

00:49:16.799 --> 00:49:18.590
So when I wrote "The
Case for Reparations,"

00:49:18.590 --> 00:49:20.850
and in much of my work
since then, for me,

00:49:20.850 --> 00:49:23.000
the most important
thing is to make people

00:49:23.000 --> 00:49:26.360
first of all aware of the debt.

00:49:26.360 --> 00:49:27.890
People don't accept the debt.

00:49:27.890 --> 00:49:30.230
And so it's like let's
move to this conversation

00:49:30.230 --> 00:49:31.070
about financing.

00:49:31.070 --> 00:49:33.980
But you don't even accept
that you owe anybody anything.

00:49:33.980 --> 00:49:40.440
You know, which for me,
seems a little backwards.

00:49:40.440 --> 00:49:41.970
And at the same
time, again, I know

00:49:41.970 --> 00:49:45.397
that there are many, many
economists who've actually

00:49:45.397 --> 00:49:46.980
done that sort of
work and say, here's

00:49:46.980 --> 00:49:48.330
a scheme for how it could work.

00:49:48.330 --> 00:49:49.369
Here are certain things.

00:49:49.369 --> 00:49:50.910
Let me be very clear
about something.

00:49:50.910 --> 00:49:52.880
I do think it involves
a payment of money.

00:49:52.880 --> 00:49:54.630
I just want to be
really clear about that.

00:49:54.630 --> 00:49:57.060
I don't think you
can separate it.

00:49:57.060 --> 00:50:00.090
And you can have all
sort of debates about--

00:50:00.090 --> 00:50:02.460
does that mean, for
instance, in neighborhoods

00:50:02.460 --> 00:50:05.370
that were redlined on
the West Side of Chicago,

00:50:05.370 --> 00:50:07.650
there should be some
sort of targeted funding

00:50:07.650 --> 00:50:09.450
for those specific blocks?

00:50:09.450 --> 00:50:10.650
Maybe it means that.

00:50:10.650 --> 00:50:13.710
Does it mean that somebody
like the lead person I write

00:50:13.710 --> 00:50:18.570
about in my article, Clyde
Ross, who was repeatedly robbed,

00:50:18.570 --> 00:50:20.340
should get an actual check.

00:50:20.340 --> 00:50:21.589
Maybe it means that.

00:50:21.589 --> 00:50:23.880
Does it mean that people who
can prove-- and I'm again,

00:50:23.880 --> 00:50:25.546
I'm confining this
because this is where

00:50:25.546 --> 00:50:27.650
I did my primary
amount of research--

00:50:27.650 --> 00:50:30.810
does it mean that people who
can necessarily prove that they

00:50:30.810 --> 00:50:33.360
went to try to use the
GI Bill to do x, y, and z

00:50:33.360 --> 00:50:35.040
and were denied
should get a check?

00:50:35.040 --> 00:50:36.287
Maybe it does.

00:50:36.287 --> 00:50:36.870
Maybe it does.

00:50:36.870 --> 00:50:38.400
But the first thing
you've got to do

00:50:38.400 --> 00:50:40.560
is acknowledge that
there was an actual crime

00:50:40.560 --> 00:50:42.300
before you move to sentencing.

00:50:42.300 --> 00:50:45.570
You have to get people
to be able to do that.

00:50:45.570 --> 00:50:50.280
And my sense is that the vast
majority of the times people

00:50:50.280 --> 00:50:51.445
say, oh, it's unworkable.

00:50:51.445 --> 00:50:52.820
My questions is
wait, wait, wait,

00:50:52.820 --> 00:50:55.440
wait-- but do you think
it's actually owed though?

00:50:55.440 --> 00:50:56.940
Are you actually
convinced of that?

00:50:56.940 --> 00:51:01.380
Because oftentimes, you
can say to somebody.

00:51:01.380 --> 00:51:03.150
I have done something to you.

00:51:03.150 --> 00:51:06.120
I can never completely
make it right.

00:51:06.120 --> 00:51:07.950
But here's what I can do.

00:51:07.950 --> 00:51:09.660
And if you can even
get there, I mean

00:51:09.660 --> 00:51:11.940
obviously you can't
completely make this right.

00:51:11.940 --> 00:51:14.969
But if you could even get there,
it would even be something.

00:51:14.969 --> 00:51:17.260
I mean this is why-- maybe
I got a little over the top.

00:51:17.260 --> 00:51:19.551
But I was very, very excited
to see Georgetown actually

00:51:19.551 --> 00:51:21.550
do something, anything.

00:51:21.550 --> 00:51:23.920
I mean I was excited
to see something.

00:51:23.920 --> 00:51:25.260
Does that make it right?

00:51:25.260 --> 00:51:27.934
Does that make up for
everything that happened?

00:51:27.934 --> 00:51:29.600
for Georgetown's
involvement in slavery?

00:51:29.600 --> 00:51:30.099
No.

00:51:30.099 --> 00:51:30.670
It doesn't.

00:51:30.670 --> 00:51:33.150
But it's at least the
admission and the attempt

00:51:33.150 --> 00:51:34.680
to start to do something.

00:51:34.680 --> 00:51:36.805
It also doesn't mean that
people shouldn't continue

00:51:36.805 --> 00:51:38.010
to pressure Georgetown.

00:51:38.010 --> 00:51:39.635
It doesn't mean that
people should just

00:51:39.635 --> 00:51:42.370
walk away from that.

00:51:42.370 --> 00:51:44.542
But at least it's an attempt.

00:51:44.542 --> 00:51:46.750
I just find it hard when
what people are trying to do

00:51:46.750 --> 00:51:49.910
is scuttle the
entire conversation.

00:51:49.910 --> 00:51:51.810
- You use the word
plunder a lot,

00:51:51.810 --> 00:51:53.630
which is a very powerful word.

00:51:53.630 --> 00:51:56.090
And as I was listening
to you just now,

00:51:56.090 --> 00:51:59.780
I was thinking we need to
have historians of plunder.

00:51:59.780 --> 00:52:04.820
And really define what the
nature of those extortions

00:52:04.820 --> 00:52:05.660
has been.

00:52:05.660 --> 00:52:14.300
And trace them in a way that
makes the power of obligation

00:52:14.300 --> 00:52:17.100
seem tangible in a sense.

00:52:17.100 --> 00:52:18.340
- I totally, I totally agree.

00:52:18.340 --> 00:52:20.940
I mean what is the price,
because there surely

00:52:20.940 --> 00:52:24.690
has to be one, if you
are again, living in--

00:52:24.690 --> 00:52:29.820
I think Mississippi was majority
black until maybe 1930 or so.

00:52:29.820 --> 00:52:33.190
If you're living in that
state, and you effectively

00:52:33.190 --> 00:52:36.130
don't have the ability
to vote, which is to say

00:52:36.130 --> 00:52:39.790
you have no say over how the
government uses tax dollars.

00:52:39.790 --> 00:52:44.470
I mean these are the
kind of economic costs.

00:52:44.470 --> 00:52:46.930
I know for Clyde
Ross what it meant

00:52:46.930 --> 00:52:49.589
was that folks could come
onto his family's property

00:52:49.589 --> 00:52:51.130
and just basically
steal the property

00:52:51.130 --> 00:52:52.421
and everything that they owned.

00:52:52.421 --> 00:52:54.550
And they had no ability
to appeal to anyone.

00:52:54.550 --> 00:52:57.640
There must be a way of putting
that in economic terms.

00:52:57.640 --> 00:52:59.980
I think that's really important.

00:52:59.980 --> 00:53:02.770
For activist reasons,
and I understand this,

00:53:02.770 --> 00:53:05.590
I think segregation
is often spoken

00:53:05.590 --> 00:53:13.510
about in a way that's meant to
appeal to people's morality.

00:53:13.510 --> 00:53:15.960
It's not fair that you and I
can't sit next to each other

00:53:15.960 --> 00:53:18.480
and have a conversation.

00:53:18.480 --> 00:53:22.230
There's something inherently
unjust about that.

00:53:22.230 --> 00:53:24.364
But I think at this
point in history,

00:53:24.364 --> 00:53:26.780
there probably needs to be a
more hard headed conversation

00:53:26.780 --> 00:53:28.780
about what segregation--
and there might already

00:53:28.780 --> 00:53:31.320
be one taking place-- about
what segregation actually

00:53:31.320 --> 00:53:35.640
is, about again, what it meant.

00:53:35.640 --> 00:53:40.020
Like what James Meredith
was actually doing--

00:53:40.020 --> 00:53:42.660
and I regret this as a
young person thinking about,

00:53:42.660 --> 00:53:45.059
I could never understand
the fight for integration.

00:53:45.059 --> 00:53:46.350
I could never understand like--

00:53:46.350 --> 00:53:48.808
if you sit next to white people,
you're going to get smart?

00:53:48.808 --> 00:53:50.000
But what is going on here.

00:53:50.000 --> 00:53:50.790
And that's because
they didn't teach

00:53:50.790 --> 00:53:52.230
the economic element of it.

00:53:52.230 --> 00:53:55.290
They didn't talk about what sort
of shape these schools were in.

00:53:55.290 --> 00:53:58.070
They didn't talk about
specifically why.

00:53:58.070 --> 00:54:00.600
The [? folks, ?] what
they wanted was access.

00:54:00.600 --> 00:54:01.210
Equal?

00:54:01.210 --> 00:54:02.835
I mean there was no
separate but equal.

00:54:02.835 --> 00:54:04.880
It didn't actually
work that way.

00:54:04.880 --> 00:54:11.070
And so if you were
laboring across generations

00:54:11.070 --> 00:54:14.370
with unequal enforcement of
the social contract, what

00:54:14.370 --> 00:54:16.400
did that cost you?

00:54:16.400 --> 00:54:18.794
And I just think that's a
really, really important

00:54:18.794 --> 00:54:20.210
question that has--
you got to get

00:54:20.210 --> 00:54:25.670
beyond these sort of moral
and sentimentalist appeals,

00:54:25.670 --> 00:54:26.460
I think.

00:54:26.460 --> 00:54:29.150
- So Ta-Nehisi, something
strikes me here as a bit

00:54:29.150 --> 00:54:29.990
contradictory.

00:54:29.990 --> 00:54:32.990
Which is we've been
talking about system,

00:54:32.990 --> 00:54:37.280
and what you've said just
now is that the feeling

00:54:37.280 --> 00:54:39.260
good about being able
to sit next to someone

00:54:39.260 --> 00:54:42.410
is not meaningful if there's
a whole system that surrounds

00:54:42.410 --> 00:54:45.350
it that's exploiting people.

00:54:45.350 --> 00:54:47.330
But as you talk
about reparations,

00:54:47.330 --> 00:54:52.940
it seemed to me more directed
at individuals or particulars

00:54:52.940 --> 00:54:56.390
rather than systematic overhaul.

00:54:56.390 --> 00:54:59.840
And in a sense, isn't
the real reparation

00:54:59.840 --> 00:55:03.850
to break down the
systems that plunder

00:55:03.850 --> 00:55:07.220
and that otherwise,
it's just a stopgap

00:55:07.220 --> 00:55:09.130
and plunder will continue.

00:55:09.130 --> 00:55:11.420
You know, I've been
thinking a lot this morning

00:55:11.420 --> 00:55:14.470
about someone I admire
enormously Bryan Stevenson.

00:55:14.470 --> 00:55:16.890
And what he's showing
about incarceration

00:55:16.890 --> 00:55:22.400
and the kind of modern
day slavery as he sees it.

00:55:22.400 --> 00:55:25.610
So if there is a way that
some sort of reparation

00:55:25.610 --> 00:55:29.270
to the person who is
redlined is offered.

00:55:29.270 --> 00:55:33.080
And we still have that system
of incarcerating black people

00:55:33.080 --> 00:55:36.530
at such an incredible rate, then
we won't have repaired things.

00:55:36.530 --> 00:55:40.540
So how do we think reparations
have to be systematic

00:55:40.540 --> 00:55:45.170
in some sense to undermine the
foundations of this plunder

00:55:45.170 --> 00:55:46.160
that you describe.

00:55:46.160 --> 00:55:48.440
- I think in this
particular case,

00:55:48.440 --> 00:55:50.330
history does give us a guide.

00:55:50.330 --> 00:55:54.830
If you look across the
board, after World War II

00:55:54.830 --> 00:55:57.550
there were manifold
reparations made

00:55:57.550 --> 00:55:59.000
to victims of the Holocaust.

00:55:59.000 --> 00:56:02.600
It wasn't merely, for
instance, just one.

00:56:02.600 --> 00:56:03.680
We did this, x, y, z.

00:56:03.680 --> 00:56:06.860
There were a series of
cases across the board made.

00:56:06.860 --> 00:56:09.565
Again, I'm focusing or
in that last comment

00:56:09.565 --> 00:56:10.940
I focused on
housing because that

00:56:10.940 --> 00:56:13.730
was the one that I
focused on, that was

00:56:13.730 --> 00:56:15.410
the one I had researched.

00:56:15.410 --> 00:56:18.110
But I would not say that to the
exclusion of all other cases

00:56:18.110 --> 00:56:20.580
for reparations to be made.

00:56:20.580 --> 00:56:24.100
And I think if you can
get, and forgive me

00:56:24.100 --> 00:56:26.000
if this sounds pie in
the sky, but if you

00:56:26.000 --> 00:56:27.770
can get a critical
mass of Americans

00:56:27.770 --> 00:56:31.880
to understand that this was an
across the board phenomenon.

00:56:31.880 --> 00:56:35.390
Again, I thought about
housing because housing is not

00:56:35.390 --> 00:56:40.750
just a place where
you can make the case,

00:56:40.750 --> 00:56:43.930
where people are alive today.

00:56:43.930 --> 00:56:48.410
It's a place where it is the
source of most Americans'

00:56:48.410 --> 00:56:48.910
wealth.

00:56:48.910 --> 00:56:51.212
It's how you assemble
wealth in this country.

00:56:51.212 --> 00:56:52.670
And if you can't
do that, if you're

00:56:52.670 --> 00:56:55.950
prevented from doing that, while
other people are allowed to do

00:56:55.950 --> 00:56:58.040
it, it's obviously a problem.

00:56:58.040 --> 00:57:00.830
But I think if you can get
the notion across the board

00:57:00.830 --> 00:57:06.770
that this was robbery
in every phase--

00:57:06.770 --> 00:57:09.590
in education, in
criminal justice,

00:57:09.590 --> 00:57:12.910
in housing, during the period
of enslavement, in voting.

00:57:12.910 --> 00:57:15.410
If you can get that
kind of manifold idea,

00:57:15.410 --> 00:57:17.525
then you can have several
cases for reparations.

00:57:17.525 --> 00:57:19.400
And probably what you
need is several things.

00:57:19.400 --> 00:57:21.190
You almost need a spirit of it.

00:57:21.190 --> 00:57:23.180
You need the country
to acknowledge

00:57:23.180 --> 00:57:25.910
this is part of
our history, and we

00:57:25.910 --> 00:57:28.850
have a responsibility across
the board to repair this.

00:57:28.850 --> 00:57:31.010
Again, it might be
individual people.

00:57:31.010 --> 00:57:33.160
That's probably
not the end of it.

00:57:33.160 --> 00:57:37.920
And I suspect if we started
doing this research,

00:57:37.920 --> 00:57:39.300
we could see it.

00:57:39.300 --> 00:57:43.970
You could see how
possible it is.

00:57:43.970 --> 00:57:47.340
Again, I think I really believe
it's the work of generations.

00:57:47.340 --> 00:57:50.780
- So we're talking today about
universities in particular.

00:57:50.780 --> 00:57:53.480
And when you think
about that, you

00:57:53.480 --> 00:57:55.790
defined a special role,
which is our teaching

00:57:55.790 --> 00:58:02.030
role, our leadership role,
our nurturing of leaders role.

00:58:02.030 --> 00:58:03.890
But there are many
other institutions

00:58:03.890 --> 00:58:07.280
in our society as
well that have had

00:58:07.280 --> 00:58:10.260
pasts that are embedded with
slavery in one way or another.

00:58:10.260 --> 00:58:12.620
Do you see other
institutions that

00:58:12.620 --> 00:58:16.070
have particular
obligations in this space?

00:58:16.070 --> 00:58:17.000
- Yeah, certainly so.

00:58:17.000 --> 00:58:19.250
And I think they
might have begun

00:58:19.250 --> 00:58:20.600
to do something about this.

00:58:20.600 --> 00:58:22.040
But I mean certainly
if you think

00:58:22.040 --> 00:58:26.150
about what happened in
Virginia with mass resistance.

00:58:26.150 --> 00:58:28.220
Wherein you had
people responding

00:58:28.220 --> 00:58:30.830
to Brown versus the Board
by effectively shutting down

00:58:30.830 --> 00:58:32.740
the public school system.

00:58:32.740 --> 00:58:35.000
Certainly that
injured some folks.

00:58:35.000 --> 00:58:38.000
When you think about-- and
I'm talking about micro cases,

00:58:38.000 --> 00:58:39.680
micro quote here.

00:58:39.680 --> 00:58:43.415
When you think about, I believe
it's North Carolina, where

00:58:43.415 --> 00:58:45.740
they were sterilizing folks.

00:58:45.740 --> 00:58:49.150
And I think they recently
were very, very successful

00:58:49.150 --> 00:58:50.330
with that.

00:58:50.330 --> 00:58:55.190
When you think about
Jon Burge in Chicago,

00:58:55.190 --> 00:58:58.760
where he was spent years
just torturing people.

00:58:58.760 --> 00:59:02.560
And they made a
successful reparations

00:59:02.560 --> 00:59:06.160
claim against the
crimes of Jon Burge.

00:59:06.160 --> 00:59:10.420
But you look at Chicago,
and you see that--

00:59:10.420 --> 00:59:11.587
and this is what happened.

00:59:11.587 --> 00:59:13.670
You look at what happened
with something like what

00:59:13.670 --> 00:59:17.920
Laquan McDonald, and you see
the tape of him being shot down.

00:59:17.920 --> 00:59:20.984
And you know that the officers
who were there covered that up.

00:59:20.984 --> 00:59:23.650
And you know that the person who
was chief of police at the time

00:59:23.650 --> 00:59:24.340
covered that up.

00:59:24.340 --> 00:59:26.544
And you know the cover up
extended all the way up

00:59:26.544 --> 00:59:27.460
to the mayor's office.

00:59:27.460 --> 00:59:29.180
That folks knew.

00:59:29.180 --> 00:59:31.005
Is there something
systemic going on

00:59:31.005 --> 00:59:33.400
with the police department?

00:59:33.400 --> 00:59:35.530
I mean that's an
institution I really

00:59:35.530 --> 00:59:40.000
think that you could probably
go across the board and study.

00:59:40.000 --> 00:59:42.790
I'm putting particular
pressure on the institutions

00:59:42.790 --> 00:59:44.692
because you guys know--

00:59:44.692 --> 00:59:46.150
you guys know, you
have a knowledge

00:59:46.150 --> 00:59:50.200
that maybe the Chicago Police
Department does not have-- yet.

00:59:50.200 --> 00:59:55.060
You know so I think it's
just incumbent on you to act.

00:59:55.060 --> 00:59:57.850
And to convince
places like that.

00:59:57.850 --> 00:59:59.800
And to convince
leaders, who will go off

00:59:59.800 --> 01:00:03.080
to be like mayors of Chicago,
and corporate leaders

01:00:03.080 --> 01:00:06.880
in big cities, that this is
a real thing not just here.

01:00:06.880 --> 01:00:07.930
But that it's systemic.

01:00:07.930 --> 01:00:08.710
It's across the board.

01:00:08.710 --> 01:00:11.043
And they really should have
a responsibility to address.

01:00:11.043 --> 01:00:16.090
I think it would make
governance for people

01:00:16.090 --> 01:00:18.790
who are fair-minded and
good, and just don't really

01:00:18.790 --> 01:00:21.700
have an understanding
of history a little bit

01:00:21.700 --> 01:00:24.970
more manageable to understand
where this stuff comes from.

01:00:24.970 --> 01:00:26.980
- I think it's a
challenge for universities

01:00:26.980 --> 01:00:30.820
because we're more likely
to have open discussions.

01:00:30.820 --> 01:00:32.470
We are more likely
to have scholars

01:00:32.470 --> 01:00:34.930
who want to do research and
dig into these questions

01:00:34.930 --> 01:00:36.100
and debate them.

01:00:36.100 --> 01:00:39.100
And so thinking about how we
can influence institutions

01:00:39.100 --> 01:00:41.530
that are less likely to
do that and don't see it

01:00:41.530 --> 01:00:44.532
as part of their mission will
be an interesting challenge

01:00:44.532 --> 01:00:45.490
that you put before us.

01:00:45.490 --> 01:00:47.870
- I mean I think, like I
said, the easiest place

01:00:47.870 --> 01:00:50.927
to start with is the students.

01:00:50.927 --> 01:00:52.510
I mean obviously
there should be more.

01:00:52.510 --> 01:00:53.530
But I think that's--

01:00:53.530 --> 01:00:55.150
I was talking to
Craig Wilder who's

01:00:55.150 --> 01:00:58.025
over here earlier about
his book Ebony and Ivy.

01:00:58.025 --> 01:00:59.650
And he was saying
they had taken it up,

01:00:59.650 --> 01:01:02.350
and it was a class at Columbia
now, on Columbia and slavery.

01:01:02.350 --> 01:01:04.194
And I asked him do
they mandate reading

01:01:04.194 --> 01:01:05.485
the book in the freshman class?

01:01:08.500 --> 01:01:10.210
I'm not a university president.

01:01:10.210 --> 01:01:13.215
I'm just talking here.

01:01:13.215 --> 01:01:16.750
But I kind of think,
I kind of think

01:01:16.750 --> 01:01:21.220
if you're going to come
to an Ivy League school,

01:01:21.220 --> 01:01:24.160
and you're going to profit
from that education,

01:01:24.160 --> 01:01:26.140
and you have not read
that book, you have

01:01:26.140 --> 01:01:28.600
done yourself a disservice.

01:01:28.600 --> 01:01:32.590
So if I were president for
the day or for the year,

01:01:32.590 --> 01:01:36.390
I might mandate that every
freshman class read that book.

01:01:36.390 --> 01:01:38.620
Or if not that book,
something like that.

01:01:38.620 --> 01:01:41.290
There's no way that I would
want to be graduating people

01:01:41.290 --> 01:01:44.920
from an institution that was
literally made possible by--

01:01:44.920 --> 01:01:47.140
slavery was the road--

01:01:47.140 --> 01:01:49.782
and have them graduate
like, I didn't know that.

01:01:49.782 --> 01:01:51.490
Now listen if they
want to be, ultimately

01:01:51.490 --> 01:01:56.442
if they want to be aggressively
ignorant or just affirmatively

01:01:56.442 --> 01:01:58.650
ignorant, there's not too
much you can do about that.

01:01:58.650 --> 01:02:01.780
But I wouldn't want the
institution to be able to say,

01:02:01.780 --> 01:02:04.210
we did not make a
sincere effort to expose

01:02:04.210 --> 01:02:06.910
every student who came to
our doors to this history.

01:02:06.910 --> 01:02:08.185
It shouldn't be optional.

01:02:08.185 --> 01:02:09.374
It shouldn't be optional.

01:02:09.374 --> 01:02:16.300
[APPLAUSE]

01:02:16.300 --> 01:02:18.760
- So African slavery
was the road,

01:02:18.760 --> 01:02:21.700
as you've said so eloquently.

01:02:21.700 --> 01:02:24.460
But there's a lot of other
plunder in the history

01:02:24.460 --> 01:02:26.590
of the United States as well.

01:02:26.590 --> 01:02:29.770
What's the role of
other forms of plunder,

01:02:29.770 --> 01:02:31.300
and what are the
responsibilities

01:02:31.300 --> 01:02:36.130
that we have to those
and to other groups that

01:02:36.130 --> 01:02:41.770
have been either systematically
or intermittently--

01:02:41.770 --> 01:02:46.600
- Possibly reparations, very
possibly reparations, you know.

01:02:46.600 --> 01:02:49.840
I'm hesitant to speak there,
because again, my research

01:02:49.840 --> 01:02:52.360
and my reporting and my
reading was very, very focused.

01:02:52.360 --> 01:02:54.630
But I don't believe
that understanding--

01:02:54.630 --> 01:02:56.110
like I don't
believe this concept

01:02:56.110 --> 01:02:58.870
should be limited
to black people.

01:02:58.870 --> 01:03:01.694
And so I would often after
I published "The Case,"

01:03:01.694 --> 01:03:03.610
I would get with people,
they would say, well,

01:03:03.610 --> 01:03:04.943
what about the Native Americans?

01:03:04.943 --> 01:03:07.174
And I would say, I would
love to read that piece.

01:03:07.174 --> 01:03:08.590
There should be a
piece like that.

01:03:08.590 --> 01:03:09.880
I would love to see it.

01:03:14.730 --> 01:03:18.820
My suspicion is that
anytime you have

01:03:18.820 --> 01:03:20.920
a hierarchical
relationship, you're

01:03:20.920 --> 01:03:23.440
probably taking something
from somebody else.

01:03:23.440 --> 01:03:24.520
That it's not incidental.

01:03:24.520 --> 01:03:28.840
It's not just a mistake.

01:03:28.840 --> 01:03:31.180
That's what I think.

01:03:31.180 --> 01:03:34.000
That does not rise to the
level of a publishable piece

01:03:34.000 --> 01:03:36.219
or something like that.

01:03:36.219 --> 01:03:38.260
But I certainly don't
think the concept should be

01:03:38.260 --> 01:03:40.950
limited to black people at all.

01:03:40.950 --> 01:03:42.450
Nor should it be,
by the way, I just

01:03:42.450 --> 01:03:43.300
want to be really
clear about this

01:03:43.300 --> 01:03:44.966
because I know this
is going to come up.

01:03:44.966 --> 01:03:48.230
Nor should it be limited
to African-Americans.

01:03:48.230 --> 01:03:50.210
Again, my research was
very, very specific.

01:03:50.210 --> 01:03:53.980
I wanted to make the most direct
and specific case I should.

01:03:53.980 --> 01:03:56.680
But I do think it's
worth asking a question

01:03:56.680 --> 01:03:58.930
about the Western
world as a whole.

01:03:58.930 --> 01:04:05.380
I think that's a fruitful and
an important line of research.

01:04:05.380 --> 01:04:07.060
- So Ta-Nehisi, what's next?

01:04:07.060 --> 01:04:09.610
Here we are in this
unexpected world

01:04:09.610 --> 01:04:13.360
after the election where, as
you said a few moments ago,

01:04:13.360 --> 01:04:15.700
this case may be even
more difficult to make

01:04:15.700 --> 01:04:20.110
in the context in which
we now find ourselves.

01:04:20.110 --> 01:04:24.200
How do you see your
writing and your mission

01:04:24.200 --> 01:04:27.070
in a sense in the
months to come?

01:04:27.070 --> 01:04:29.350
Is it to continue to make
the case for reparations

01:04:29.350 --> 01:04:30.040
specifically?

01:04:30.040 --> 01:04:31.780
Is it to branch out from that?

01:04:31.780 --> 01:04:33.940
- Probably not.

01:04:33.940 --> 01:04:34.780
Probably not.

01:04:37.480 --> 01:04:38.730
I'm a little confused right.

01:04:38.730 --> 01:04:40.021
I'm just being honest with you.

01:04:40.021 --> 01:04:43.511
I'm a little confused right
now, not by your question

01:04:43.511 --> 01:04:44.010
or anything.

01:04:44.010 --> 01:04:48.050
But just-- you're going to have
to bear with me through this.

01:04:48.050 --> 01:04:49.797
I didn't expect any of this.

01:04:49.797 --> 01:04:51.380
I certainly didn't
expect all of this.

01:04:51.380 --> 01:04:52.838
It's certainly an
honor to be here.

01:04:52.838 --> 01:04:57.050
I really appreciate being here.

01:04:57.050 --> 01:05:01.670
I started this as a really,
relatively, at the time,

01:05:01.670 --> 01:05:06.200
obscure blog, in an attempt
to understand the Civil War.

01:05:06.200 --> 01:05:07.290
It was my attempt.

01:05:07.290 --> 01:05:08.200
It was just for me.

01:05:08.200 --> 01:05:11.120
There was no bigger thing
that was coming out of that.

01:05:11.120 --> 01:05:13.550
And as I read and the
thing spooled out,

01:05:13.550 --> 01:05:16.910
I came to understand
more and more things,

01:05:16.910 --> 01:05:19.190
and even up to the
point when I wrote

01:05:19.190 --> 01:05:23.142
"The Case for Reparations,"
it wasn't clear to me

01:05:23.142 --> 01:05:24.350
that it would have an effect.

01:05:24.350 --> 01:05:24.975
You understand?

01:05:24.975 --> 01:05:29.300
Because reparations was and
does at this very moment

01:05:29.300 --> 01:05:34.910
exist on a particular place
way beyond over the window.

01:05:34.910 --> 01:05:37.940
And so the notion that it would
be read and taken seriously

01:05:37.940 --> 01:05:41.200
and become as successful and
some of the things I write

01:05:41.200 --> 01:05:43.940
would end up where they
were, was not something

01:05:43.940 --> 01:05:45.295
that I foresaw.

01:05:45.295 --> 01:05:46.670
I always tell
people writers have

01:05:46.670 --> 01:05:50.210
to prepare themselves and
academics, too, not to be read,

01:05:50.210 --> 01:05:52.220
not to be read.

01:05:52.220 --> 01:05:54.380
So I was a little
ill-prepared for this moment.

01:05:54.380 --> 01:05:57.540
And I think if there's anything,
I'm struggling to get back,

01:05:57.540 --> 01:06:02.160
and I don't want anybody
to take this the wrong way,

01:06:02.160 --> 01:06:05.160
I didn't begin this to
advocate for reparations.

01:06:05.160 --> 01:06:10.500
And that's not really
how writers work.

01:06:10.500 --> 01:06:16.460
I began with my own
native curiosity.

01:06:16.460 --> 01:06:19.340
And I'm trying to
get back to that.

01:06:19.340 --> 01:06:22.400
I think it's really, really
important that I do that.

01:06:22.400 --> 01:06:24.470
I think I'm not an activist.

01:06:24.470 --> 01:06:25.340
I'm not an advocate.

01:06:25.340 --> 01:06:29.310
Doesn't mean I'm not in sympathy
with activists and advocates.

01:06:29.310 --> 01:06:32.120
But I think my work
is at its best when

01:06:32.120 --> 01:06:34.040
I am answering a
question that is really,

01:06:34.040 --> 01:06:37.010
really burning inside of me.

01:06:37.010 --> 01:06:39.650
The question of
reparations isn't too much.

01:06:39.650 --> 01:06:43.350
I think the answer is
pretty clear actually.

01:06:43.350 --> 01:06:45.980
- And you wrote this
extraordinary piece

01:06:45.980 --> 01:06:50.570
about President Obama and
were given unparalleled access

01:06:50.570 --> 01:06:51.070
to him.

01:06:51.070 --> 01:06:54.700
You had several long
interviews with him.

01:06:54.700 --> 01:06:57.480
Would you reflect on that
piece just for a moment

01:06:57.480 --> 01:07:00.230
and how you see it
in the trajectory

01:07:00.230 --> 01:07:03.710
of your understanding
of race in America,

01:07:03.710 --> 01:07:08.739
as you think about the meaning
of that first black presidency?

01:07:08.739 --> 01:07:09.530
- It was important.

01:07:09.530 --> 01:07:12.770
And just to direct it to
why are we here today,

01:07:12.770 --> 01:07:15.770
I got to ask him
about reparations.

01:07:15.770 --> 01:07:17.960
I mean and he talked about it.

01:07:17.960 --> 01:07:20.060
We talked about it--

01:07:20.060 --> 01:07:22.251
if that interview went on
for an hour and a half,

01:07:22.251 --> 01:07:23.750
we probably talked
about reparations

01:07:23.750 --> 01:07:25.190
for 30 or 45 minutes.

01:07:29.180 --> 01:07:32.360
Although, as you
know, Sandy says,

01:07:32.360 --> 01:07:35.700
[INAUDIBLE] Sandy Darity says,
his answer was not to my mind

01:07:35.700 --> 01:07:40.200
sufficient, he did say, listen,
you can make a case for it.

01:07:40.200 --> 01:07:42.875
That you're not crazy for saying
something actually was taken,

01:07:42.875 --> 01:07:45.770
and something-- to hear
an American president

01:07:45.770 --> 01:07:49.160
actually say that
was tremendous to me.

01:07:49.160 --> 01:07:49.870
It was huge.

01:07:49.870 --> 01:07:52.429
Again I got to be
really clear about this.

01:07:52.429 --> 01:07:54.470
When I say that it was
tremendous, when I say it,

01:07:54.470 --> 01:07:56.600
it does not mean that you
don't critique people.

01:07:56.600 --> 01:07:58.640
It does not mean
that you back off.

01:07:58.640 --> 01:08:02.660
But I think you also need to
acknowledge the steps forward

01:08:02.660 --> 01:08:03.645
that you actually make.

01:08:03.645 --> 01:08:05.270
Doesn't mean you
don't need more steps,

01:08:05.270 --> 01:08:07.640
but I think you
need to make those.

01:08:07.640 --> 01:08:13.470
At the same time, in the
spirit of what I just said,

01:08:13.470 --> 01:08:17.109
I felt like he didn't--

01:08:17.109 --> 01:08:19.700
how do I explain this--

01:08:19.700 --> 01:08:21.620
he had what I would say
is the conventional,

01:08:21.620 --> 01:08:25.189
and I think this is across the
board from the Bernie Sanders

01:08:25.189 --> 01:08:27.800
folks, all we owe to
Obama, to Hillary,

01:08:27.800 --> 01:08:31.460
all across the basic liberal
understanding of race,

01:08:31.460 --> 01:08:35.240
is that the way you address
it is by addressing poverty.

01:08:35.240 --> 01:08:39.967
And it's hard to get
people to understand.

01:08:39.967 --> 01:08:41.550
When I did "The Case
for Reparations,"

01:08:41.550 --> 01:08:43.770
it is very important for me
to focus on black middle class

01:08:43.770 --> 01:08:44.270
families.

01:08:44.270 --> 01:08:46.680
And that wasn't to the
exclusion of black poor people.

01:08:46.680 --> 01:08:50.160
It was to say, OK,
the dynamic here,

01:08:50.160 --> 01:08:53.670
the conversation here says, if
these people play by the rules,

01:08:53.670 --> 01:08:54.600
everything will be OK.

01:08:54.600 --> 01:08:57.183
OK, let's go examine some people
who played by the rules then.

01:08:57.183 --> 01:08:58.930
Let's see how it ended up.

01:08:58.930 --> 01:09:00.630
Let me define this--
they got robbed.

01:09:00.630 --> 01:09:04.410
They acted like it was not
that the country wanted

01:09:04.410 --> 01:09:06.160
them to be successful.

01:09:06.160 --> 01:09:08.490
The country actually
resented their success.

01:09:08.490 --> 01:09:11.430
And that's all, I mean that's
the voice in reconstruction.

01:09:11.430 --> 01:09:12.420
It's the same thing.

01:09:12.420 --> 01:09:15.390
It's a resentment
of your success.

01:09:15.390 --> 01:09:19.529
It is not that, hey, you know
if you would just marry and get

01:09:19.529 --> 01:09:20.990
a job, everything will be OK.

01:09:20.990 --> 01:09:22.740
No, you marry, get a
job, save your money,

01:09:22.740 --> 01:09:23.698
and you will be robbed.

01:09:23.698 --> 01:09:25.270
It sets you up to be punished.

01:09:25.270 --> 01:09:27.930
It was very, very important.

01:09:27.930 --> 01:09:33.120
Because it cuts against
the dominant liberal theory

01:09:33.120 --> 01:09:37.227
that there is nothing specific
about black people as a class

01:09:37.227 --> 01:09:38.310
of people in this country.

01:09:38.310 --> 01:09:41.819
That it is not a specific thing
that needs to be addressed.

01:09:41.819 --> 01:09:45.300
And to his mind, he
thought basically

01:09:45.300 --> 01:09:48.330
if you would construct
a decent social safety

01:09:48.330 --> 01:09:52.380
net, a more liberal, more
European social safety net,

01:09:52.380 --> 01:09:57.270
if you could very,
very directly enforce

01:09:57.270 --> 01:09:59.250
anti-discrimination laws,
I'm for all of them,

01:09:59.250 --> 01:10:01.420
for both of those things.

01:10:01.420 --> 01:10:03.859
And here's where the
magic happens, then

01:10:03.859 --> 01:10:05.650
through the individual
work of black people

01:10:05.650 --> 01:10:08.690
you can close the [INAUDIBLE].

01:10:08.690 --> 01:10:09.860
And I think I said this.

01:10:09.860 --> 01:10:11.151
I was definitely thinking this.

01:10:11.151 --> 01:10:13.190
We've been working
for a long time, man.

01:10:13.190 --> 01:10:15.050
I mean the work
ethic is not lacking.

01:10:15.050 --> 01:10:17.990
That's not the missing
component here.

01:10:17.990 --> 01:10:20.450
That's not the missing thing.

01:10:20.450 --> 01:10:23.870
And that was hard to get across.

01:10:23.870 --> 01:10:26.000
I was very, very grateful
for the exchange,

01:10:26.000 --> 01:10:28.760
but at the same time
it, to me, points out

01:10:28.760 --> 01:10:30.620
how far we have to go.

01:10:30.620 --> 01:10:34.790
I engaged Senator Sanders
on this during the election,

01:10:34.790 --> 01:10:40.150
because if you have a
candidate on the left,

01:10:40.150 --> 01:10:46.100
on the radical left who can't
even see this, long way to go,

01:10:46.100 --> 01:10:47.310
a long way to go.

01:10:47.310 --> 01:10:49.290
- I'm struck as you're
speaking, that in a way,

01:10:49.290 --> 01:10:53.280
Obama's presidency is another
embodiment of your argument.

01:10:53.280 --> 01:10:54.540
He played by the rules.

01:10:54.540 --> 01:10:55.080
- He did.

01:10:55.080 --> 01:10:59.000
- He thought he could preside
over a post-racial moment.

01:10:59.000 --> 01:11:00.690
Remember all the
discussion about we're

01:11:00.690 --> 01:11:02.640
in a post-racial moment?

01:11:02.640 --> 01:11:07.020
And so what rules did he
get to take advantage of?

01:11:07.020 --> 01:11:10.660
Well, he didn't get his Supreme
Court nominee, because somebody

01:11:10.660 --> 01:11:12.244
said we're not
playing by the rules,

01:11:12.244 --> 01:11:13.410
and the whole birther stuff.

01:11:13.410 --> 01:11:17.400
So in a sense, the
argument you have,

01:11:17.400 --> 01:11:19.020
or the disagreement
you had with him,

01:11:19.020 --> 01:11:22.177
I think you won based on his
own, the nature of his own--

01:11:22.177 --> 01:11:23.635
- Yeah, he would
disagree with you.

01:11:26.484 --> 01:11:28.150
Yeah, and I thought
so, too, by the way.

01:11:28.150 --> 01:11:28.800
And I raised that.

01:11:28.800 --> 01:11:30.133
I raised all of these incidents.

01:11:30.133 --> 01:11:32.340
And I very much said, listen.

01:11:32.340 --> 01:11:36.129
And his argument, and maybe to
be a politician you ultimately

01:11:36.129 --> 01:11:37.920
have to believe this,
and I don't mean that

01:11:37.920 --> 01:11:40.110
in any sort of derogatory
way when I say politician.

01:11:40.110 --> 01:11:45.410
But if you're about the
business of convincing people,

01:11:45.410 --> 01:11:49.040
you have to believe that, not
just the majority of people

01:11:49.040 --> 01:11:53.570
are decent and non-racist, but
that not even an actionable

01:11:53.570 --> 01:11:55.180
or significant minority are.

01:11:55.180 --> 01:11:57.440
And so if you talk to
him, he would say, well,

01:11:57.440 --> 01:11:59.630
the problem was Fox News.

01:11:59.630 --> 01:12:03.500
You know I agree that
was part of the problem.

01:12:03.500 --> 01:12:05.210
But I think I asked
him, but yeah,

01:12:05.210 --> 01:12:06.550
why are they watching Fox News?

01:12:06.550 --> 01:12:10.630
There's a ready audience
for this kind of argument.

01:12:10.630 --> 01:12:13.340
It came up again in the
election with Hillary Clinton

01:12:13.340 --> 01:12:15.380
and the whole deplorables.

01:12:15.380 --> 01:12:18.680
And it's like wait-- we
have numbers on this.

01:12:18.680 --> 01:12:20.070
We have actual data.

01:12:20.070 --> 01:12:21.980
When you have 40%
of your voters who

01:12:21.980 --> 01:12:23.630
believe black people
are more criminal,

01:12:23.630 --> 01:12:25.460
that's kind of deplorable, man.

01:12:25.460 --> 01:12:27.770
You know, when the majority
of the coalition believes,

01:12:27.770 --> 01:12:31.370
against all evidence, that the
President of the United States

01:12:31.370 --> 01:12:32.120
is a Muslim.

01:12:32.120 --> 01:12:33.950
And by Muslim, they
don't simply mean

01:12:33.950 --> 01:12:35.540
thinks the Koran
is very important,

01:12:35.540 --> 01:12:37.740
but means something else.

01:12:37.740 --> 01:12:40.610
That's kind of deplorable.

01:12:40.610 --> 01:12:44.005
But we can't get
ourselves there.

01:12:44.005 --> 01:12:44.880
You know what I mean?

01:12:44.880 --> 01:12:45.463
We just can't.

01:12:45.463 --> 01:12:54.490
And I think what it is is maybe
if we acknowledged all of it--

01:12:54.490 --> 01:12:56.590
like we would go crazy.

01:12:56.590 --> 01:12:59.020
Maybe we just would cease
to be able to function.

01:12:59.020 --> 01:13:00.620
Like it's just too--

01:13:00.620 --> 01:13:02.274
is it really, really that bad?

01:13:02.274 --> 01:13:03.190
Was it really, really?

01:13:03.190 --> 01:13:04.840
Yes, it was really,
really that bad.

01:13:07.944 --> 01:13:09.860
Because I have to think
from some perspective,

01:13:09.860 --> 01:13:11.443
obviously I'm arguing
for reparations,

01:13:11.443 --> 01:13:14.734
but I don't think
it's sufficient to say

01:13:14.734 --> 01:13:15.400
you're ignorant.

01:13:15.400 --> 01:13:16.300
You don't know.

01:13:16.300 --> 01:13:18.020
But why?

01:13:18.020 --> 01:13:18.520
Why?

01:13:18.520 --> 01:13:21.340
Like if I'm in that position,
why would I not want to know?

01:13:21.340 --> 01:13:23.365
What kind of pressures,
what kind of stress

01:13:23.365 --> 01:13:27.460
does it bring upon
the belief system that

01:13:27.460 --> 01:13:31.300
one functions in to actually
acknowledge the debt,

01:13:31.300 --> 01:13:34.020
to say nothing of
actually doing something?

01:13:34.020 --> 01:13:36.590
What does it actually do?

01:13:36.590 --> 01:13:39.770
- So we are almost at
the end of our time,

01:13:39.770 --> 01:13:44.410
and I just wanted to know
whether you come to all this

01:13:44.410 --> 01:13:47.500
at this moment with a sense
of optimism and dynamism

01:13:47.500 --> 01:13:50.140
about where it can go?

01:13:50.140 --> 01:13:53.310
Or if you feel burdened
by it in the way you--

01:13:53.310 --> 01:13:55.300
if you knew too much,
it would be unbearable.

01:13:55.300 --> 01:13:56.320
- Well, I don't feel burdened.

01:13:56.320 --> 01:13:57.770
I mean I'd rather
know than not know.

01:13:57.770 --> 01:13:58.700
I'm one of those people.

01:13:58.700 --> 01:13:59.950
But I just have to
say, it's extremely

01:13:59.950 --> 01:14:02.590
ironic for any historian to
ask me if I feel optimistic.

01:14:02.590 --> 01:14:05.586
[LAUGHTER]

01:14:05.586 --> 01:14:06.280
I'm sorry.

01:14:06.280 --> 01:14:07.660
You can't go out and talk,
right, and people say,

01:14:07.660 --> 01:14:09.210
why you don't have any hope?

01:14:09.210 --> 01:14:12.640
Have you spent any time
around any historians at all?

01:14:12.640 --> 01:14:14.230
Like you're talking about me?

01:14:14.230 --> 01:14:17.163
Do you read this stuff that
these people are writing?

01:14:17.163 --> 01:14:18.420
I mean Jesus.

01:14:21.460 --> 01:14:22.880
No, I'm not optimistic.

01:14:22.880 --> 01:14:24.700
I mean, how could you?

01:14:24.700 --> 01:14:26.700
I mean I'm not pessimistic.

01:14:26.700 --> 01:14:29.110
I mean it almost feels
like a question of optimism

01:14:29.110 --> 01:14:29.920
or pessimism.

01:14:29.920 --> 01:14:33.760
And like it's almost
beside the point.

01:14:33.760 --> 01:14:37.090
It is what it is, and
people need to act,

01:14:37.090 --> 01:14:39.940
whether I think they're
likely to act or not.

01:14:39.940 --> 01:14:42.730
And when I say this, and
I've said this before,

01:14:42.730 --> 01:14:45.880
I root myself in the
very, very real tradition

01:14:45.880 --> 01:14:50.290
of enslaved black
people in this country.

01:14:50.290 --> 01:14:52.470
1619, folks are enslaved.

01:14:52.470 --> 01:14:55.280
I'm pretty sure they know it's
wrong from the moment they're

01:14:55.280 --> 01:14:56.190
enslaved.

01:14:56.190 --> 01:14:57.461
And they say it all through--

01:14:57.461 --> 01:14:57.960
listen.

01:14:57.960 --> 01:15:01.110
250 Years is a long time.

01:15:01.110 --> 01:15:02.520
That's a lot of generations.

01:15:02.520 --> 01:15:05.490
And you can be at certain
points and look to the past,

01:15:05.490 --> 01:15:09.030
and see that all of your
ancestors as far back

01:15:09.030 --> 01:15:10.984
as you can see are enslaved.

01:15:10.984 --> 01:15:12.650
And all your children
and grandchildren,

01:15:12.650 --> 01:15:16.510
descendants as far forward as
you can see, will be enslaved.

01:15:16.510 --> 01:15:18.970
And in the midst of
that, people acted.

01:15:18.970 --> 01:15:20.170
They did things.

01:15:20.170 --> 01:15:22.660
You know, when
Frederick Douglass,

01:15:22.660 --> 01:15:26.070
you know abolitionists stand
up, and they say this is wrong.

01:15:26.070 --> 01:15:28.000
They're not the first
people to do that.

01:15:28.000 --> 01:15:30.832
Now we focus on them because
it actually turned out

01:15:30.832 --> 01:15:32.290
to be successful
at the end of day.

01:15:32.290 --> 01:15:34.300
So it's easy to focus
on the successes.

01:15:34.300 --> 01:15:36.460
But I'm much more
interested in the failures.

01:15:36.460 --> 01:15:41.270
You know, I think about Ida B.
Wells, who with so much courage

01:15:41.270 --> 01:15:44.510
argued and pushed and tried
to coax the American Congress

01:15:44.510 --> 01:15:45.760
to do this anti-lynching bill.

01:15:45.760 --> 01:15:48.250
Which it did not
do in her lifetime

01:15:48.250 --> 01:15:51.440
and didn't even apologize
until like 2004 or something,

01:15:51.440 --> 01:15:53.110
long after Ida B. Wells.

01:15:53.110 --> 01:15:56.870
Does that mean that her
actions were worthless?

01:15:56.870 --> 01:15:59.350
Does it mean it was meaningless?

01:15:59.350 --> 01:16:01.270
Certainly in hindsight,
you could say, well,

01:16:01.270 --> 01:16:03.811
one should have been pessimistic
about those [? processes. ?]

01:16:03.811 --> 01:16:04.900
That's beside the point.

01:16:04.900 --> 01:16:07.390
You have a moral
responsibility to act,

01:16:07.390 --> 01:16:09.660
to do, to think, to know.

01:16:09.660 --> 01:16:11.080
- What a great way to stop.

01:16:11.080 --> 01:16:12.280
Thank you so much.

01:16:12.280 --> 01:16:13.830
- Thank you.
