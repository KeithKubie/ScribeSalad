ANDREW RALLES: Welcome everyone,
to Talks at Google New York.

00:00:31.370 --> 00:00:33.030
My name is Andrew Ralles.

00:00:33.030 --> 00:00:36.110
Our guest today is jazz
vocalist Candice Hoyes.

00:00:36.110 --> 00:00:39.100
She's here to speak to
us about her debut album,

00:00:39.100 --> 00:00:41.690
entitled "On a Turquoise Cloud."

00:00:41.690 --> 00:00:44.570
On the album, Candice interprets
some very rare Duke Ellington

00:00:44.570 --> 00:00:47.080
songs that are definitely
worthy of a lot more attention.

00:00:47.080 --> 00:00:48.980
So I'm so excited
that she's here

00:00:48.980 --> 00:00:51.050
to share her music with us.

00:00:51.050 --> 00:00:53.880
I also wanted to mention that
I was introduced to Candice

00:00:53.880 --> 00:00:56.610
by another Googler by the
name of Ben Tarbell, who

00:00:56.610 --> 00:01:00.050
works out of our Mountain View
office on the Energy Team.

00:01:00.050 --> 00:01:00.870
A really great guy.

00:01:00.870 --> 00:01:03.060
I'm just so happy that he
connected me with Candice.

00:01:03.060 --> 00:01:05.030
And I've enjoyed
getting to know her

00:01:05.030 --> 00:01:06.890
during the planning
of this event.

00:01:06.890 --> 00:01:09.560
She just has such an
amazing story and path

00:01:09.560 --> 00:01:10.880
to get to this point.

00:01:10.880 --> 00:01:12.713
And I'll give you a
little bit of background

00:01:12.713 --> 00:01:14.890
about her musical history.

00:01:14.890 --> 00:01:20.157
She started on the
piano at the age of six.

00:01:20.157 --> 00:01:22.240
Got her start singing
professionally in children's

00:01:22.240 --> 00:01:24.170
theater at the age of 11.

00:01:24.170 --> 00:01:27.940
She graduated from Harvard
University with honors.

00:01:27.940 --> 00:01:31.140
She also has a Master's
Degree in Voice Performance

00:01:31.140 --> 00:01:33.970
and Pedagogy from Westminster
Choir College in Princeton, New

00:01:33.970 --> 00:01:36.520
Jersey.

00:01:36.520 --> 00:01:40.230
She is a classically
trained singer, a soprano.

00:01:40.230 --> 00:01:43.450
She's done opera and has
performed in six languages.

00:01:43.450 --> 00:01:45.980
She's sung internationally
at festivals.

00:01:45.980 --> 00:01:48.480
Has performed here in New
York City at Lincoln Center

00:01:48.480 --> 00:01:50.960
and Carnegie Hall, as well.

00:01:50.960 --> 00:01:52.460
Again, so happy that she's here.

00:01:52.460 --> 00:01:54.560
Please give a warm
welcome to Candice Hoyes.

00:01:54.560 --> 00:01:57.560
[APPLAUSE]

00:02:03.780 --> 00:02:07.820
So I'd love for you to tell
everyone about the album

00:02:07.820 --> 00:02:13.360
and just how you were drawn to
the material and a little bit

00:02:13.360 --> 00:02:17.960
about how the concept of "On a
Turquoise Could" came together.

00:02:17.960 --> 00:02:20.800
CANDICE HOYES: Well, it was
really a labor of love for me,

00:02:20.800 --> 00:02:22.260
I'd say.

00:02:22.260 --> 00:02:23.960
And this is my debut album.

00:02:23.960 --> 00:02:28.010
So it's been such an
exciting journey for me.

00:02:28.010 --> 00:02:31.750
As you mentioned, I have
a liberal arts background.

00:02:31.750 --> 00:02:33.730
And certainly,
history is something

00:02:33.730 --> 00:02:35.580
that's always inspired me.

00:02:35.580 --> 00:02:38.700
And I'd say Duke
Ellington is, for me,

00:02:38.700 --> 00:02:42.680
the most prolific and
most quintessential

00:02:42.680 --> 00:02:44.590
American composer.

00:02:44.590 --> 00:02:47.340
And I do have a
classical training.

00:02:47.340 --> 00:02:49.610
But one of the most
pivotal moments for me

00:02:49.610 --> 00:02:52.720
was singing with Jazz
at Lincoln Center

00:02:52.720 --> 00:02:55.780
a couple years ago on a very
special project that was

00:02:55.780 --> 00:02:57.960
composed by Wynton Marsalis.

00:02:57.960 --> 00:03:01.040
And that's someone that I've
always really looked up to,

00:03:01.040 --> 00:03:06.180
as someone who has never
been impeded by a genre.

00:03:06.180 --> 00:03:08.520
He's a foremost jazz
musician, for anyone

00:03:08.520 --> 00:03:11.320
who's not familiar with
him, amazing trumpeter.

00:03:11.320 --> 00:03:14.710
But he also draws from
many musical influences,

00:03:14.710 --> 00:03:16.440
as I always have.

00:03:16.440 --> 00:03:20.790
And so when I did that
gig, I just started really

00:03:20.790 --> 00:03:24.310
opening my mind, like what
could my first album be about?

00:03:24.310 --> 00:03:26.600
What could be the
subject matter?

00:03:26.600 --> 00:03:29.010
And so I did go back
to Duke Ellington.

00:03:29.010 --> 00:03:33.990
And it's been a lifelong
source of musical inspiration.

00:03:33.990 --> 00:03:36.280
He's such a innovator.

00:03:36.280 --> 00:03:38.580
And I started
exploring these songs

00:03:38.580 --> 00:03:41.500
and come to find
through research, which

00:03:41.500 --> 00:03:45.860
is where the good liberal
arts background comes in,

00:03:45.860 --> 00:03:49.890
no one's recorded them, many
of them, since Ellington.

00:03:49.890 --> 00:03:54.940
So we are the first of our
generation to share these.

00:03:54.940 --> 00:03:58.010
I say we because some of
these amazing musicians

00:03:58.010 --> 00:04:01.490
recorded the album with
me, arranged to play it on.

00:04:01.490 --> 00:04:05.060
And we certainly are living it
out as we tour all of-- these

00:04:05.060 --> 00:04:07.150
are some of my
favorite musicians.

00:04:07.150 --> 00:04:11.260
So it's just been
an amazing journey.

00:04:11.260 --> 00:04:17.630
And every time I tour and
every time I go to a new place,

00:04:17.630 --> 00:04:18.850
it's Duke Ellington.

00:04:18.850 --> 00:04:22.450
But I'm bringing something
very undiscovered.

00:04:22.450 --> 00:04:24.410
So it's a discovery for me.

00:04:24.410 --> 00:04:26.880
And then it becomes a
discovery for the audience.

00:04:26.880 --> 00:04:29.150
So it was really an
exciting time for me.

00:04:32.884 --> 00:04:35.050
ANDREW RALLES: It's just
absolutely beautiful music.

00:04:35.050 --> 00:04:38.075
And I can't wait for you
to play a couple of tunes

00:04:38.075 --> 00:04:38.700
from the album.

00:04:38.700 --> 00:04:41.520
But just on the
topic of discovery,

00:04:41.520 --> 00:04:45.320
there are some songs on it
that maybe a lot of people

00:04:45.320 --> 00:04:47.140
never heard before.

00:04:47.140 --> 00:04:50.420
I think they're lesser known
than some of Duke Ellington's

00:04:50.420 --> 00:04:51.920
other material.

00:04:51.920 --> 00:04:54.160
But in particular,
he wrote a few songs

00:04:54.160 --> 00:04:57.940
for classically
trained sopranos.

00:04:57.940 --> 00:05:01.520
And I'd love for you to talk
a little bit about the women

00:05:01.520 --> 00:05:07.370
in the original recordings
and your connection to them.

00:05:07.370 --> 00:05:12.840
CANDICE HOYES: Well, that really
touches on more people who've

00:05:12.840 --> 00:05:14.600
very much inspired me.

00:05:14.600 --> 00:05:16.580
There was one
particular vocalist

00:05:16.580 --> 00:05:19.210
who Duke Ellington
really discovered.

00:05:19.210 --> 00:05:21.070
And her name is Kay Davis.

00:05:21.070 --> 00:05:25.030
And she was a classically
trained vocalist,

00:05:25.030 --> 00:05:27.060
much like myself.

00:05:27.060 --> 00:05:31.370
Went to Northwestern in the '40s
and did her musical training

00:05:31.370 --> 00:05:34.460
in the time when
conservatory was segregated.

00:05:34.460 --> 00:05:36.870
So she was one of the
stars of her class

00:05:36.870 --> 00:05:39.280
and was chosen to
be very featured

00:05:39.280 --> 00:05:45.170
in her senior performance
opposite a white tenor.

00:05:45.170 --> 00:05:47.180
And that was controversial
on that campus.

00:05:47.180 --> 00:05:48.060
And this is Chicago.

00:05:48.060 --> 00:05:50.400
It's not even the Deep South.

00:05:50.400 --> 00:05:53.760
And by great fortune,
Duke Ellington

00:05:53.760 --> 00:05:56.770
came to hear her perform
her senior recital

00:05:56.770 --> 00:05:58.610
and discovered her talent.

00:05:58.610 --> 00:06:03.490
And whereas she was encountering
those obstacles in the academy

00:06:03.490 --> 00:06:08.060
and in classical music,
Ellington just saw the talent

00:06:08.060 --> 00:06:10.780
and saw that she had
something to say.

00:06:10.780 --> 00:06:12.910
And so he brought
her into the band.

00:06:12.910 --> 00:06:17.270
And as you know, Andrew,
with your musical background,

00:06:17.270 --> 00:06:20.430
a lot of jazz musicians start
so very early on the road,

00:06:20.430 --> 00:06:22.220
especially in those days.

00:06:22.220 --> 00:06:25.400
So she really was coming from
the conservatory environment

00:06:25.400 --> 00:06:29.760
and just hit the road, traveled
through the Jim Crow South

00:06:29.760 --> 00:06:32.880
with the Duke Ellington
band, the only lady

00:06:32.880 --> 00:06:36.060
in the band for a
great stretch of time.

00:06:36.060 --> 00:06:38.800
And Ellington started to
compose for her voice.

00:06:38.800 --> 00:06:41.640
And so he wrote "On
a Turquoise Cloud,"

00:06:41.640 --> 00:06:43.830
for which I've named the album.

00:06:43.830 --> 00:06:47.340
And it's a wordless vocalise.

00:06:47.340 --> 00:06:52.540
A vocalise is a classical
term of art describing using

00:06:52.540 --> 00:06:54.370
the voice like an instrument.

00:06:54.370 --> 00:06:56.890
And so there are no words.

00:06:56.890 --> 00:06:59.690
And just the vocal
musical texture

00:06:59.690 --> 00:07:02.810
joins into the
texture of the band.

00:07:02.810 --> 00:07:10.240
And so for me, that kind
of assimilation musically,

00:07:10.240 --> 00:07:12.990
it has a lot to do with
how I feel about the album

00:07:12.990 --> 00:07:15.926
because I feel like
I'm going through that.

00:07:15.926 --> 00:07:17.550
So it was a perfect
name for the album.

00:07:17.550 --> 00:07:19.700
But it's also a
way of remembering

00:07:19.700 --> 00:07:23.880
Kay Davis and a way of
acknowledging what Ellington

00:07:23.880 --> 00:07:26.780
did for artists like me, who
don't really have a category.

00:07:28.792 --> 00:07:30.000
ANDREW RALLES: OK, thank you.

00:07:30.000 --> 00:07:31.680
And I think we have
some images of Kay

00:07:31.680 --> 00:07:33.735
and a few of the other singers.

00:07:33.735 --> 00:07:35.860
CANDICE HOYES: Yes, that's
Kay Davis in the middle.

00:07:35.860 --> 00:07:36.568
Oh, it's labeled.

00:07:36.568 --> 00:07:37.410
That's even better.

00:07:37.410 --> 00:07:41.160
Adelaide Hall, Adelaide
Hall in the '20s.

00:07:41.160 --> 00:07:44.570
And we're going to play
it one of those tunes

00:07:44.570 --> 00:07:48.230
that she made famous
called "Creole Love Call"

00:07:48.230 --> 00:07:49.690
when we start playing.

00:07:49.690 --> 00:07:57.086
And many people say that she
is the first person to scat.

00:07:57.086 --> 00:08:01.500
But her scatting was in that
soprano range and growling.

00:08:01.500 --> 00:08:04.720
And so those are
some jazz terms.

00:08:04.720 --> 00:08:06.610
But basically, it
means there was

00:08:06.610 --> 00:08:10.270
a lot of freedom and
improvisation in her singing.

00:08:10.270 --> 00:08:13.170
But she was also a great lady
of musical theater and stage

00:08:13.170 --> 00:08:14.400
and cabaret.

00:08:14.400 --> 00:08:17.495
And Alice Babs
hails from Norway.

00:08:17.495 --> 00:08:18.310
No, Sweden.

00:08:18.310 --> 00:08:19.070
I'm sorry.

00:08:19.070 --> 00:08:23.370
Sweden, but Ellington was such
a international musical figure

00:08:23.370 --> 00:08:27.070
that he really pulled his
voices and inspirations much

00:08:27.070 --> 00:08:30.480
as we do in this world, in 2016.

00:08:30.480 --> 00:08:32.429
It's a global experience.

00:08:32.429 --> 00:08:34.179
Tech is a global experience.

00:08:34.179 --> 00:08:36.590
In music too.

00:08:36.590 --> 00:08:38.159
And so he had so
many influences.

00:08:38.159 --> 00:08:41.558
So we actually deal with
that music on the album too.

00:08:44.239 --> 00:08:45.280
ANDREW RALLES: OK, great.

00:08:45.280 --> 00:08:48.910
Well, why don't we hear a
couple of songs from the album?

00:08:48.910 --> 00:08:49.959
Are we ready to--

00:08:49.959 --> 00:08:51.000
CANDICE HOYES: I'm ready.

00:08:51.000 --> 00:08:52.060
Are you guys ready?

CANDICE HOYES: Thank you.

00:16:57.750 --> 00:17:00.140
I'd now like to
bring to the stage

00:17:00.140 --> 00:17:05.119
another very essential
part of this album, someone

00:17:05.119 --> 00:17:08.579
that I actually toured
with Wynton Marsalis

00:17:08.579 --> 00:17:12.500
with when I mentioned
I had that very kind

00:17:12.500 --> 00:17:16.319
of formative experience
with Jazz at Lincoln Center

00:17:16.319 --> 00:17:17.420
orchestra.

00:17:17.420 --> 00:17:21.430
And he's an amazing collaborator
who came onto this project

00:17:21.430 --> 00:17:24.160
and arranged music
for the album.

00:17:24.160 --> 00:17:29.840
And this is our very
special, special musician,

00:17:29.840 --> 00:17:31.664
Vincent Gardner on trombone.

00:17:31.664 --> 00:17:34.700
[APPLAUSE]

00:17:36.530 --> 00:17:41.170
And this tune is very
special because it's actually

00:17:41.170 --> 00:17:44.160
Duke Ellington's first
international hit.

00:17:44.160 --> 00:17:48.680
And it started in 1927,
when Ellington composed

00:17:48.680 --> 00:17:51.920
this tune, inspired
by another song

00:17:51.920 --> 00:17:54.810
from a musical called
"Indian Love Call."

00:17:54.810 --> 00:17:58.090
And he called it
"Creole Love Call."

00:17:58.090 --> 00:18:01.670
Jazz was actually born in New
Orleans, as many of you know.

00:18:01.670 --> 00:18:05.450
And so he was really
claiming that piece

00:18:05.450 --> 00:18:08.820
of music, that musical idea
that was really popular

00:18:08.820 --> 00:18:13.500
and appropriating it for jazz
and really putting his spin

00:18:13.500 --> 00:18:16.130
on it and calling it
"Creole Love Call."

00:18:16.130 --> 00:18:21.390
And originally, Billy
Strayhorn wrote those lyrics.

00:18:21.390 --> 00:18:23.310
And he wrote them
about-- the lyrics

00:18:23.310 --> 00:18:27.830
are like, [SINGING] "My love,
my love, my love, my love,

00:18:27.830 --> 00:18:30.710
I see you across
the swamp my love."

00:18:30.710 --> 00:18:31.950
Something like that.

00:18:31.950 --> 00:18:32.850
And I'm from Florida.

00:18:32.850 --> 00:18:35.420
But the swamp wasn't
really turning me on.

00:18:35.420 --> 00:18:41.090
So [LAUGHS] I said, I'm going
to write some lyrics for this.

00:18:41.090 --> 00:18:46.280
And so they do come from a
little bit of life experience.

00:18:46.280 --> 00:18:58.008
So without any further ado,
this is "Creole Love Call."

But I'm so glad

share one more with you.

But you can certainly follow me.

I'm high tech.

00:27:04.770 --> 00:27:09.020
I'm low tech with
acoustic vocals

00:27:09.020 --> 00:27:12.600
and the classical
and jazz singing.

00:27:12.600 --> 00:27:13.380
But I'm high tech.

00:27:13.380 --> 00:27:15.870
And you can certainly follow
me on all the social things

00:27:15.870 --> 00:27:18.870

shows and hear us.

00:27:18.870 --> 00:27:21.260

We thank you for welcoming us
to Google and Talks at Google.

00:27:26.580 --> 00:27:32.010
And this last tune
is very special to me

00:27:32.010 --> 00:27:36.980
because it really expresses
the whirlwind of emotion when

00:27:36.980 --> 00:27:39.920
you release your first album
and all the amazing people

00:27:39.920 --> 00:27:44.210
that you meet along the way and
the wonderful musicians that

00:27:44.210 --> 00:27:48.550
become more like family than
colleagues or even friends.

00:27:48.550 --> 00:27:53.790
And Duke Ellington actually
had a very specific bond

00:27:53.790 --> 00:27:58.560
with one particular musician
throughout his entire-- well,

00:27:58.560 --> 00:28:00.790
from the moment
they met, they were

00:28:00.790 --> 00:28:04.680
kind of musically
inseparable, Billy Strayhorn.

00:28:04.680 --> 00:28:09.450
And so this melody, it's one of
the most famous jazz melodies.

00:28:09.450 --> 00:28:11.890
People know it as
"Lotus Blossom."

00:28:11.890 --> 00:28:17.860
But upon the death,
they added lyrics.

00:28:17.860 --> 00:28:20.610
Well, Alice Babs
and her collaborator

00:28:20.610 --> 00:28:23.080
added lyrics to
this melody to make

00:28:23.080 --> 00:28:25.590
it a tribute to Duke Ellington.

00:28:25.590 --> 00:28:29.480
And so it's a really
beautiful tune called

00:28:29.480 --> 00:28:33.694
"Thank You for Everything."

up in the aisles here.

how you liked the music.

00:32:35.360 --> 00:32:37.170
Hi.

00:32:37.170 --> 00:32:39.380
AUDIENCE: So I was curious
about a couple of things.

00:32:39.380 --> 00:32:43.617
One was I've never
heard any jazz

00:32:43.617 --> 00:32:45.200
with the kind of
vocalization that you

00:32:45.200 --> 00:32:47.840
did in "On a Turquoise Cloud."

00:32:47.840 --> 00:32:49.230
Is that a unique piece?

00:32:49.230 --> 00:32:53.970
Or are there other pieces
done with that kind of vocals,

00:32:53.970 --> 00:32:56.510
either by Ellington
or other composers?

00:32:56.510 --> 00:32:58.930
CANDICE HOYES: There
really are, actually.

00:32:58.930 --> 00:33:02.910
I did my research for this album
by going back to this source.

00:33:02.910 --> 00:33:05.520
So I went to the National
Archive and researched Duke

00:33:05.520 --> 00:33:07.570
Ellington and had
his manuscripts

00:33:07.570 --> 00:33:11.560
in my hand, the actual penciled
manuscripts, transcribed, some,

00:33:11.560 --> 00:33:13.680
by Billy Strayhorn.

00:33:13.680 --> 00:33:15.950
And I found about 30 songs.

00:33:15.950 --> 00:33:19.160
So it was really
quite eye-opening.

00:33:19.160 --> 00:33:20.670
But they definitely exist.

00:33:20.670 --> 00:33:27.450
And I tend to think that
many classical and jazz

00:33:27.450 --> 00:33:29.680
and musical theater
compositions of today

00:33:29.680 --> 00:33:34.350
are so influenced by this
kind of improvisatory use

00:33:34.350 --> 00:33:35.750
of that high range.

00:33:35.750 --> 00:33:39.420
I mean, a lot of people,
even from Minnie Riperton,

00:33:39.420 --> 00:33:44.340
a soul singer that so many
people know, use that range.

00:33:44.340 --> 00:33:46.740
And so it is something
that's really, I think,

00:33:46.740 --> 00:33:47.950
continued in the music.

00:33:47.950 --> 00:33:50.596
But it is particular
to Ellington.

00:33:50.596 --> 00:33:53.930
AUDIENCE: Thank you.

00:33:53.930 --> 00:33:56.210
AUDIENCE: Thank you very
much for the performance.

00:33:56.210 --> 00:33:58.500
I had a question I hadn't
thought about until you

00:33:58.500 --> 00:33:59.470
started performing.

00:33:59.470 --> 00:34:02.860
You had at least two
songs with new lyrics

00:34:02.860 --> 00:34:07.730
or new interpretations beyond
just the usual interpretation.

00:34:07.730 --> 00:34:10.310
And I wondered when you were
researching and preparing

00:34:10.310 --> 00:34:13.969
the albums, did you have
any trepidations about that?

00:34:13.969 --> 00:34:17.670
Because it's not that jazz
is sacred in the sense

00:34:17.670 --> 00:34:19.957
that it never changes
because it's always changing.

00:34:19.957 --> 00:34:21.540
But when you're
dealing with something

00:34:21.540 --> 00:34:25.290
like Ellington's
music or Strayhorn,

00:34:25.290 --> 00:34:27.429
I'm sure there's a body
of people out there

00:34:27.429 --> 00:34:30.210
who probably don't
want any changes.

00:34:30.210 --> 00:34:32.235
It's like, this is
the classic jazz.

00:34:32.235 --> 00:34:34.110
CANDICE HOYES: Oh, you
met some of the people

00:34:34.110 --> 00:34:35.394
that I met along the way.

00:34:35.394 --> 00:34:36.310
AUDIENCE: No, I just--

00:34:36.310 --> 00:34:36.920
CANDICE HOYES: It's true.

00:34:36.920 --> 00:34:38.650
AUDIENCE: It's just that when
I was first got interested

00:34:38.650 --> 00:34:40.350
in jazz, it always was an issue.

00:34:40.350 --> 00:34:42.230
I got interested in jazz
when the avant garde

00:34:42.230 --> 00:34:43.530
was coming along.

00:34:43.530 --> 00:34:47.540
And it was a big
all-nighter type topic

00:34:47.540 --> 00:34:50.010
of whether you know Archie
Shepp or whoever it would be,

00:34:50.010 --> 00:34:53.929
Cecil Taylor, whether they
were on the right track

00:34:53.929 --> 00:34:57.420
or they were just almost
like the French avante garde,

00:34:57.420 --> 00:35:00.510
just tearing down the old movies
so that their movies could

00:35:00.510 --> 00:35:01.020
come in.

00:35:01.020 --> 00:35:02.930
The same concept in jazz.

00:35:02.930 --> 00:35:05.490
You had the traditional
jazz artists and then

00:35:05.490 --> 00:35:06.700
this new group coming in.

00:35:09.170 --> 00:35:10.920
I'm not trying to make
this controversial.

00:35:10.920 --> 00:35:12.753
But I wondered if this
was an issue for you.

00:35:12.753 --> 00:35:16.260
CANDICE HOYES: Oh, you hit
on the heart of the matter.

00:35:16.260 --> 00:35:18.670
The question is, if
I had any trepidation

00:35:18.670 --> 00:35:22.070
about really putting my
stamp on Duke Ellington

00:35:22.070 --> 00:35:25.470
music and Strayhorn
music on my first album.

00:35:25.470 --> 00:35:30.010
And yes, it did
take some courage.

00:35:30.010 --> 00:35:37.592
And it's a journey
that I continue to-- it

00:35:37.592 --> 00:35:39.040
continues to challenge me.

00:35:39.040 --> 00:35:43.400
But it's also the very joy and
the very opportunity of jazz

00:35:43.400 --> 00:35:45.340
is that--

00:35:45.340 --> 00:35:47.150
Actually, when Vincent
and I were on tour,

00:35:47.150 --> 00:35:49.710
we ended up talking a
lot about that, and some

00:35:49.710 --> 00:35:52.040
of our other colleagues,
that there's really

00:35:52.040 --> 00:35:55.620
an onus for all musicians,
especially jazz musicians,

00:35:55.620 --> 00:35:59.670
I feel, I believe, to record
and put your stamp on it

00:35:59.670 --> 00:36:04.390
and to leave your
mark in this legacy.

00:36:04.390 --> 00:36:08.430
And then I feel like I doubled
down on that sense of purpose

00:36:08.430 --> 00:36:11.390
when I got to the Archive and
saw that these manuscripts--

00:36:11.390 --> 00:36:13.880
first of all, they didn't
exist as lead sheets.

00:36:13.880 --> 00:36:18.170
So that means, for the layman,
that we as vocalists couldn't

00:36:18.170 --> 00:36:20.510
even really choose them.

00:36:20.510 --> 00:36:22.060
They weren't really an option.

00:36:22.060 --> 00:36:23.820
So they had to be transformed.

00:36:23.820 --> 00:36:26.530
And they had to be transformed
by somebody who loved the music

00:36:26.530 --> 00:36:27.321
and believed in it.

00:36:27.321 --> 00:36:29.760
And I said, that's me.

00:36:29.760 --> 00:36:31.300
And so it was a
very humble process.

00:36:31.300 --> 00:36:32.840
It continues to be
a humble process

00:36:32.840 --> 00:36:35.490
because I revere those artists.

00:36:35.490 --> 00:36:39.250
But it's very much
what I was meant to do.

00:36:39.250 --> 00:36:42.920
So I can't imagine
it any other way.

00:36:45.629 --> 00:36:47.420
ANDREW RALLES: Do we
have another question?

00:36:47.420 --> 00:36:48.570
CANDICE HOYES: Yes, hello.

00:36:48.570 --> 00:36:49.200
AUDIENCE: Hi.

00:36:49.200 --> 00:36:51.150
Yes, other than the
National Archives,

00:36:51.150 --> 00:36:53.740
where does one look
for unpublished

00:36:53.740 --> 00:36:56.900
or unrecorded
Ellington repertoire?

00:36:56.900 --> 00:36:59.120
CANDICE HOYES: So
one of the privileges

00:36:59.120 --> 00:37:01.650
of this album, because
it's such classic music

00:37:01.650 --> 00:37:04.840
and it's so innovative
and its life.

00:37:04.840 --> 00:37:07.047
It's not new.

00:37:07.047 --> 00:37:08.880
But I was actually
thinking about this a lot

00:37:08.880 --> 00:37:10.921
when I was thinking about
coming to Google today,

00:37:10.921 --> 00:37:13.290
the difference
between my generation

00:37:13.290 --> 00:37:15.740
is always looking at the new.

00:37:15.740 --> 00:37:18.670
And I was thinking,
this album, as you said,

00:37:18.670 --> 00:37:20.810
it's music that I recovered.

00:37:20.810 --> 00:37:23.241
But sometimes innovation
doesn't come out of newness.

00:37:23.241 --> 00:37:23.740
Right?

00:37:23.740 --> 00:37:26.370
Sometimes it comes out
of repurposing something

00:37:26.370 --> 00:37:27.970
that exists already.

00:37:27.970 --> 00:37:30.385
And so with that
said, this music

00:37:30.385 --> 00:37:32.010
has brought me to
all different spaces,

00:37:32.010 --> 00:37:35.100
not just Google, but also this
huge international Ellington

00:37:35.100 --> 00:37:39.000
convention that I attended
earlier this season.

00:37:39.000 --> 00:37:41.550
And honestly, the
National Archive

00:37:41.550 --> 00:37:44.360
is just the tip of the iceberg
for finding rare Ellington

00:37:44.360 --> 00:37:45.860
material.

00:37:45.860 --> 00:37:49.760
Some of my greatest sources
were through the oral tradition.

00:37:49.760 --> 00:37:51.800
We had the privilege
of recording

00:37:51.800 --> 00:37:56.292
with a dear friend and
someone we revere very much,

00:37:56.292 --> 00:37:56.875
Joe Temperley.

00:38:00.000 --> 00:38:04.660
He's an amazing
artist and actually

00:38:04.660 --> 00:38:09.270
recorded one of his signature
songs on this album with us,

00:38:09.270 --> 00:38:11.220
which was a great privilege.

00:38:11.220 --> 00:38:13.890
And he imparted a
lot of information

00:38:13.890 --> 00:38:15.432
about Ellington
and rare Ellington.

00:38:15.432 --> 00:38:16.890
So just through
the oral tradition,

00:38:16.890 --> 00:38:19.760
you can get a lot
of information.

00:38:19.760 --> 00:38:23.650
People present me with
DVDs of Ellington's films.

00:38:23.650 --> 00:38:26.770
For me, for one of the songs, I
didn't find it in the Archive,

00:38:26.770 --> 00:38:28.350
for "Violet Blue."

00:38:28.350 --> 00:38:31.975
Actually, there is no real
vocal manuscript available.

00:38:31.975 --> 00:38:36.990
And so I had to extract
the sound using tech.

00:38:36.990 --> 00:38:39.800
I had to extract the sound
from a old movie clip.

00:38:39.800 --> 00:38:43.170
So I think anywhere that you're
curious to find Ellington,

00:38:43.170 --> 00:38:46.220
you can find a lot of gems.

00:38:46.220 --> 00:38:47.220
ANDREW RALLES: One more.

00:38:47.220 --> 00:38:47.940
CANDICE HOYES: Oh, don't be shy.

00:38:47.940 --> 00:38:48.546
Come on.

00:38:48.546 --> 00:38:51.535
AUDIENCE: Well, so in the
process of that research,

00:38:51.535 --> 00:38:56.750
do you imagine maybe
there's undiscovered

00:38:56.750 --> 00:38:59.770
Miles Davis or Charlie
Parker or whatever out there?

00:38:59.770 --> 00:39:02.476
Are you thinking of
doing anything like that?

00:39:02.476 --> 00:39:04.300
Or are you going to
stick with Ellington?

00:39:04.300 --> 00:39:06.810
CANDICE HOYES: Oh,
well, I would say I'm

00:39:06.810 --> 00:39:08.354
going to stick with all of it.

00:39:08.354 --> 00:39:10.020
Your question was
like, what would I see

00:39:10.020 --> 00:39:13.560
for a future project upcoming.

00:39:13.560 --> 00:39:20.310
I will always be culling through
the artists who influenced me,

00:39:20.310 --> 00:39:22.800
including, yes, Miles Davis.

00:39:22.800 --> 00:39:25.830
There are many
artists wh0 ranging

00:39:25.830 --> 00:39:28.980
from Stevie Wonder, Yo-Yo Ma.

00:39:28.980 --> 00:39:31.900
I have a lot of
different influences.

00:39:31.900 --> 00:39:33.670
I don't know what my
next project will be,

00:39:33.670 --> 00:39:36.820
if it will be about rare works.

00:39:36.820 --> 00:39:40.130
But it's certainly something
I'm very interested in

00:39:40.130 --> 00:39:42.280
because I think that,
as young musicians,

00:39:42.280 --> 00:39:47.390
it's important to enjoy that
music and really gain from it

00:39:47.390 --> 00:39:51.280
all the inspiration
that is in it

00:39:51.280 --> 00:39:55.700
and to share it with our
peers in this generation.

00:39:55.700 --> 00:39:58.790
And so it's a part of
my purpose, I feel like.

00:39:58.790 --> 00:40:00.960
It probably will be a part
of everything that I do.

00:40:00.960 --> 00:40:03.780
But as far as the
particulars, I think

00:40:03.780 --> 00:40:06.430
the next project will probably
have more of my writing on it.

00:40:09.460 --> 00:40:13.230
AUDIENCE: So I was also curious.

00:40:13.230 --> 00:40:14.920
I mean, do you
think other artists,

00:40:14.920 --> 00:40:16.970
like, in the National
Archive or other places,

00:40:16.970 --> 00:40:21.510
that there are more of these
kinds of undiscovered tunes

00:40:21.510 --> 00:40:22.020
out there?

00:40:22.020 --> 00:40:23.811
CANDICE HOYES: Are more
undiscovered tunes?

00:40:23.811 --> 00:40:24.750
Absolutely.

00:40:24.750 --> 00:40:27.940
And as I was mentioning
before, there

00:40:27.940 --> 00:40:29.550
are so many ways
to describe them.

00:40:29.550 --> 00:40:33.990
Some of them are just by hearing
live music and meeting players

00:40:33.990 --> 00:40:37.170
and getting clues as to,
oh, did you check out

00:40:37.170 --> 00:40:38.490
this recording of that?

00:40:38.490 --> 00:40:40.220
And that can lead
you to the music

00:40:40.220 --> 00:40:42.360
that you've never heard of.

00:40:42.360 --> 00:40:46.350
But yes, I mean, there
certainly is rare music

00:40:46.350 --> 00:40:48.190
being discovered all
the time because there

00:40:48.190 --> 00:40:49.981
are a lot of people
who are very-- not just

00:40:49.981 --> 00:40:52.436
me-- very passionate
about chasing it down.

00:40:56.269 --> 00:40:58.810
ANDREW RALLES: OK, well, I think
we're just about out of time

00:40:58.810 --> 00:40:59.700
here.

00:40:59.700 --> 00:41:03.730
But thanks so much to
Candice and her amazing band,

00:41:03.730 --> 00:41:05.800
the Talks at Google
team, and all of you

00:41:05.800 --> 00:41:07.562
for joining us today.

00:41:07.562 --> 00:41:08.770
Have a great rest of the day.

00:41:08.770 --> 00:41:09.290
CANDICE HOYES: Thank you.

00:41:09.290 --> 00:41:10.210
Thanks, Andrew.

00:41:10.210 --> 00:41:13.260
[APPLAUSE]
