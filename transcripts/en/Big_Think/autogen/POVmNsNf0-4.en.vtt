it's been pretty easy to switch to other
 

00:02:22.100 --> 00:02:24.160
it's been pretty easy to switch to other
things because I get interested in them

get more responsibilities you get more
 

00:03:06.170 --> 00:03:09.220
get more responsibilities you get more
success and that could tends to narrow

00:03:09.220 --> 00:03:09.230
success and that could tends to narrow
 

00:03:09.230 --> 00:03:12.040

your options not increase them but

00:03:12.040 --> 00:03:12.050
your options not increase them but
 

00:03:12.050 --> 00:03:13.780
your options not increase them but
what's the point of success if you don't

00:03:13.780 --> 00:03:13.790
what's the point of success if you don't
 

00:03:13.790 --> 00:03:15.070
what's the point of success if you don't
have your own options and you don't make

00:03:15.070 --> 00:03:15.080
have your own options and you don't make
 

00:03:15.080 --> 00:03:18.580
have your own options and you don't make
your own decision so for that reason I

00:03:18.580 --> 00:03:18.590
your own decision so for that reason I
 

00:03:18.590 --> 00:03:20.290
your own decision so for that reason I
decided I had to really make a decision

00:03:20.290 --> 00:03:20.300
decided I had to really make a decision
 

00:03:20.300 --> 00:03:22.090
