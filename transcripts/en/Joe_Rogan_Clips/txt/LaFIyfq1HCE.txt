Speaker 1:          00:00          The Joe Rogan experience. Are you, you're aware of a Elon Musk's neuro link chair technology? How much do you know about it? I know a decent amount in my friend Brian Johnson, he has a company kernel. There's a few different companies that are trying to think about these brain machine interfaces and what are they trying to do? Basically what they're trying to do is to find a way to connect our brains to our machines and there's a little bit of of progress in our brains are, they're incredibly complicated and they're messy. I mean if there, there's a lot that's that, that that's happening, but we are increasingly figuring out how to connect our brains to our technology and so people are imagining a time when we can do things like download, download memories, download ideas or Upload Memories and upload that he hasn't, there's some very early science that is suggesting that this will be possible, but it's still the very early days, the very early days.

Speaker 1:          00:55          But he, Elon was giving the impression that some time this year they're going to release something. You know, they may release something, but it's not going to be something that's going to change the world because this, this, that technology is way more nascent than even the genetics technology that, um, that I've been talking about. So it's not like that there's that it's it all remotely possible that this year you're going to be able to like upload a full memory or download a full memory. But there, there are little things that are happening, but every, every journey begins with a step. But the technology is fairly transparent is term in terms of like where the state of the art is right now. It is in that it's extremely early. This stuff is real. So when you think of like about systems that we understand, I had mentioned that we, you know, we understand just a little bit about genomics.

Speaker 1:          01:44          Um, we know less about the brain. The brain is kind of the great unknown of this universe. We know more about the oceans than we know about our brain. I mean, it's just, we know very, very little. We understand that if you kind of stick an electric current in somebody's brain, like that's going to be, if you kind of shoot a spike through somebody's head, but really understanding how the brain functions, we are still in the very, very early days. So do you think the Kurzweils off with this idea that you're going to be able to download your consciousness into a computer? Cause that's one of the most controversial ideas that he's come up with. So I think he's, I think he's off. Um, based on your use of the word your, so I mentioned that a month ago I was in Kyoto, uh, and I was at this, um, at this stem cell lab, but I also went to another lab of a guy named Hiroshi Ishiguro, who's the world's leading humanoid roboticist.

Speaker 1:          02:35          And so he's the guy who was on the cover of wired and he's created these robot avatars. And like I had a conversation with this, this robot woman, Erica. And it was really interesting cause I could see that. Like if I would smile, she'd smile and lean forward. And if I had like a, you know, overexaggerated sad face, she'd like change her expression and she can have like, you know, basic, basic conversations. Wow. But we're still a long way and so from, from having full robots, but I had this, uh, fro about human interactions, but I had this, this debate, um, with issue guru and he was saying that he thought that the future of humanity was nonbiological that we are going to kind of unload ourselves, um, to these non biological entities and that is how we would gain our own mortality. And [inaudible] I argued something very different.

Speaker 1:          03:24          I feel like we are biological beings. I think we'll fully integrate with our technology, but if we ever become entirely nonbiological, then that's not us either. We will have committed suicide as a species or these, um, robots are there. That will have killed us because even if, let's just say that I could download my entire consciousness to some kind of robot unless it's say that was possible, that robot would be me for that first exact moment when the transfer happened. But then beyond that, they wouldn't be me anymore because there'll be a whole other set of, of expense. But we're, but certainly our interaction or connectivity with this tech is going to be greater. And so even if Kurzweil isn't exactly right, he's directionally right. Yeah. The problem would be that you would be locked in a, if they downloaded your consciousness into some sort of a, a bank of computer somewhere, right.

Speaker 1:          04:19          Where are you if that's your consciousness, your consciousness and these ones and Zeros. Yeah. We, I mean, that's terrifying. Terrifying as some didn't like you. And they said, I'm going to make one version of you suffer for all eternity. Yeah. Yeah. And I'm going to just, I don't load you while you sleep. It's true. But I have something worse than that. Okay. Death. And so I think that nobody is going to say, well, I'm going to be Joe living a life or I'm going to like not be Joe and I'll just have my consciousness downloaded someplace else. And so if the comparison is, well, I've lived this life and I don't want to die. And so I'd rather kind of be here in some kind of version, and even if it's not me, to something really, I think some people will want that. Not Everybody.

Speaker 1:          05:05          Some people will, but they don't know what they're getting. Right? Yes. In terms of you don't know what that experience is going to be like. Yeah. Nor do you know if there is some sort of a chemical gateway that happens in the mind when you do expire and allows you to pass through to the other dimension that you're, your consciousness and your soul longs to travel to. But no, you've, I hope, I hope you're right about that. Am I? If I'm not, yeah, I've written about this in my novel. It's like, yeah, but I think kind of when you're dead, you're just dead. And the good news for you that though, well, just because I think that you, this kind of immortality because, because time stops time is this relative concept. And so at the moment that you die, that's immortality for you because time stops flowing for you. Time is, that's what Einstein taught us. Time is this relative concept. Other people, they're legitimately, and there's no way to prove it, feel that we have this soul and this soul can travel to other, other dimensions. I happen to believe that we are biological beings and our experience of the soul or whatever is connected to our biology. When our biology stops functioning, those experiences, whatever they are, stop being accessible, at least to us.
