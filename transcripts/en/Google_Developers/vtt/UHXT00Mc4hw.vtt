TIMOTHY JORDAN:
Hello and welcome

00:00:08.930 --> 00:00:09.929
to the "Developer Show."

00:00:09.929 --> 00:00:11.310
I'm your host Timothy Jordan.

00:00:11.310 --> 00:00:13.842
Let's start with a quick review
of what happened recently

00:00:13.842 --> 00:00:15.300
with the Google
Developer platform,

00:00:15.300 --> 00:00:17.730
also known as the TLDR.

00:00:17.730 --> 00:00:19.980
Perform complex back
end logic on data

00:00:19.980 --> 00:00:22.450
store in real time with
automatic synchronization

00:00:22.450 --> 00:00:26.130
across devices-- Android
plus Firebase plus Google

00:00:26.130 --> 00:00:28.020
App Engine makes it happen.

00:00:28.020 --> 00:00:30.472
David East is here today to
explain it all a bit further.

00:00:30.472 --> 00:00:32.061
DAVID EAST: That's me.

00:00:32.061 --> 00:00:33.810
TIMOTHY JORDAN: Logs
just got a lot better

00:00:33.810 --> 00:00:36.400
with Metrics Advanced
Filters and Charts brought

00:00:36.400 --> 00:00:39.180
to you by Google Cloud Logging
and Google Cloud Monitoring,

00:00:39.180 --> 00:00:41.560
available today in beta.

00:00:41.560 --> 00:00:44.420
Improved navigation, search,
customization, and visibility

00:00:44.420 --> 00:00:46.990
are available today in a
beta new design of the cloud

00:00:46.990 --> 00:00:47.810
console.

00:00:47.810 --> 00:00:50.970
Try it today and let
us know what you think.

00:00:50.970 --> 00:00:53.800
Universal app campaigns and
user acquisition performance

00:00:53.800 --> 00:00:56.630
reporting is now available in
Google Play Developer Console

00:00:56.630 --> 00:00:59.080
to make ads and user
growth as simple as writing

00:00:59.080 --> 00:01:01.150
an async task.

00:01:01.150 --> 00:01:03.920
A recent Google Shopper
survey revealed that over 40%

00:01:03.920 --> 00:01:06.890
of people are likely to use
their phones to pay digitally

00:01:06.890 --> 00:01:08.810
for products this
holiday season.

00:01:08.810 --> 00:01:11.140
Google's Head of commerce
Sridhar Ramaswamy

00:01:11.140 --> 00:01:13.830
recently sat down with "Fortune"
to discuss this and more

00:01:13.830 --> 00:01:15.160
commerce trends to come.

00:01:15.160 --> 00:01:16.820
Joanna Smith is
on the show today

00:01:16.820 --> 00:01:18.920
to discuss what this
means for us developers.

00:01:18.920 --> 00:01:21.770
JOANNA SMITH: Money.

00:01:21.770 --> 00:01:23.680
TIMOTHY JORDAN: As
the crow flies is not

00:01:23.680 --> 00:01:25.470
the best measure of proximity.

00:01:25.470 --> 00:01:28.210
But thanks to the
Distance Matrix Service

00:01:28.210 --> 00:01:30.010
as part of the
Google Maps API, you

00:01:30.010 --> 00:01:31.530
can calculate what
point of interest

00:01:31.530 --> 00:01:35.440
is actually the closest
to travel for your users.

00:01:35.440 --> 00:01:38.970
Get a Project Tango developer
kit for 50% off with a special

00:01:38.970 --> 00:01:41.880
limited time offer on the
Google Store available soon,

00:01:41.880 --> 00:01:44.360
and keep an eye out on the
Google+ community for an update

00:01:44.360 --> 00:01:44.900
on the sale.

00:01:44.900 --> 00:01:47.130
And in the meantime,
check out the recent app

00:01:47.130 --> 00:01:49.350
contest winners for
some inspiration.

00:01:49.350 --> 00:01:53.710
Links in the description below
with all the other links.

00:01:53.710 --> 00:01:55.940
Record your game play
and share it on YouTube

00:01:55.940 --> 00:01:58.340
from your phone with an
update to Google Play Games.

00:01:58.340 --> 00:02:01.370
It includes support for your
front-facing camera and mic,

00:02:01.370 --> 00:02:03.830
so we know how you really
feel about that hidden bomb.

00:02:03.830 --> 00:02:06.000
Also, we're working
on an SDK for this,

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:09.610
so you can build it right
into your own app or game.

00:02:09.610 --> 00:02:11.285
VR is cool.

00:02:11.285 --> 00:02:12.300
Seriously, it's cool.

00:02:12.300 --> 00:02:13.850
And Google Cardboard
now makes it

00:02:13.850 --> 00:02:16.225
possible around the
world in 39 languages

00:02:16.225 --> 00:02:20.430
and in more than 100 countries
on both Android and iOS-- oh,

00:02:20.430 --> 00:02:22.720
and the SDK got updated too.

00:02:22.720 --> 00:02:25.320
Fred Sauer is also cool
and on the show today

00:02:25.320 --> 00:02:27.560
to tell us a little
more about Cardboard.

00:02:27.560 --> 00:02:29.934
FRED SAUER: I'm super
excited to be here today.

00:02:29.934 --> 00:02:31.850
TIMOTHY JORDAN: Turkish
mobile games developer

00:02:31.850 --> 00:02:34.470
Peak Games has a growing
user base in the US

00:02:34.470 --> 00:02:36.000
with their game Spades Plus.

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:39.050
The game generates over
70% of its mobile revenue

00:02:39.050 --> 00:02:40.111
from Android.

00:02:40.111 --> 00:02:41.860
We recently had a chat
with them about how

00:02:41.860 --> 00:02:44.580
they improved user
engagement, increased installs

00:02:44.580 --> 00:02:47.760
with Google Play Store listing
experiments and app promotion,

00:02:47.760 --> 00:02:50.130
as well as other Android
and Google Play features

00:02:50.130 --> 00:02:51.870
that help them be successful.

00:02:51.870 --> 00:02:54.790
Here's a quick clip from the
video-- a peek, if you will,

00:02:54.790 --> 00:02:55.515
at Peak Games.

00:02:55.515 --> 00:02:57.566
[VIDEO PLAYBACK]

00:02:57.566 --> 00:02:59.990
-Peak Games was founded in 2010.

00:02:59.990 --> 00:03:03.050
Our aim is to create
global technology products

00:03:03.050 --> 00:03:04.642
and reach millions of users.

00:03:04.642 --> 00:03:06.840
We take the classic
game experience

00:03:06.840 --> 00:03:08.390
and migrate it to mobile.

00:03:08.390 --> 00:03:10.750
Additional to that, we
also build casual games.

00:03:10.750 --> 00:03:13.070
Android is our priority
mobile platform.

00:03:13.070 --> 00:03:16.230
Currently, we have 65K
open stores every day.

00:03:16.230 --> 00:03:18.590
Most of our games are
dependent on scale,

00:03:18.590 --> 00:03:20.360
and getting more
users in Android

00:03:20.360 --> 00:03:22.750
is a lot easier than any
other mobile platform.

00:03:22.750 --> 00:03:24.610
Android has been super
helpful in growing

00:03:24.610 --> 00:03:26.730
international markets,
and that's where

00:03:26.730 --> 00:03:28.190
we believe our future is lying.

00:03:28.190 --> 00:03:28.930
[END PLAYBACK]

00:03:28.930 --> 00:03:30.388
TIMOTHY JORDAN:
You can find a link

00:03:30.388 --> 00:03:33.170
to the full video below
in the show notes below.

00:03:33.170 --> 00:03:33.990
They're awesome.

00:03:33.990 --> 00:03:35.040
Click on things.

00:03:35.040 --> 00:03:37.510
Fred, Cardboard,
you have Cardboard.

00:03:37.510 --> 00:03:40.140
Tell us about Cardboard, the
new release, and all that stuff.

00:03:40.140 --> 00:03:42.340
FRED SAUER: OK so Cardboard,
obviously awesome.

00:03:42.340 --> 00:03:43.173
TIMOTHY JORDAN: Yes.

00:03:43.173 --> 00:03:45.780
FRED SAUER: But as a developer,
you want to build great apps.

00:03:45.780 --> 00:03:48.670
So now we have a new SDK
that has some performance

00:03:48.670 --> 00:03:50.720
improvements and gives
you better image quality.

00:03:50.720 --> 00:03:51.850
TIMOTHY JORDAN: Excellent.

00:03:51.850 --> 00:03:54.660
And it has something to do with
the distortion and the lenses,

00:03:54.660 --> 00:03:55.210
right?

00:03:55.210 --> 00:03:57.184
FRED SAUER: Yeah,
so the distortion

00:03:57.184 --> 00:03:59.100
that we have to put in
the image to compensate

00:03:59.100 --> 00:04:01.690
for the lenses in there
is done more efficiently.

00:04:01.690 --> 00:04:04.137
So we can give you more
pixels, higher quality images.

00:04:04.137 --> 00:04:05.970
TIMOTHY JORDAN: And
that's just a recompile.

00:04:05.970 --> 00:04:06.340
FRED SAUER: Yes.

00:04:06.340 --> 00:04:07.631
TIMOTHY JORDAN: That's awesome.

00:04:07.631 --> 00:04:08.342
I love Cardboard.

00:04:08.342 --> 00:04:10.050
Did I ever tell you
why I love Cardboard?

00:04:10.050 --> 00:04:10.310
FRED SAUER: Why?

00:04:10.310 --> 00:04:12.143
TIMOTHY JORDAN: I'm
sure I have, because I'm

00:04:12.143 --> 00:04:13.442
a huge VR geek, which you know.

00:04:13.442 --> 00:04:15.150
FRED SAUER: Tell me
your Cardboard story.

00:04:15.150 --> 00:04:16.870
TIMOTHY JORDAN: They might
not know I'm a huge VR geek,

00:04:16.870 --> 00:04:19.750
but the thing is, that when
I was first getting into VR,

00:04:19.750 --> 00:04:21.570
it was so expensive.

00:04:21.570 --> 00:04:22.640
I just couldn't see it.

00:04:22.640 --> 00:04:23.980
It was prohibitive for--

00:04:23.980 --> 00:04:26.330
FRED SAUER: Like
$10,000 for head--

00:04:26.330 --> 00:04:26.620
TIMOTHY JORDAN:
That's right, and that

00:04:26.620 --> 00:04:29.390
didn't even the include the
computer and all the software

00:04:29.390 --> 00:04:30.030
and whatever.

00:04:30.030 --> 00:04:31.030
But now--

00:04:31.030 --> 00:04:32.480
FRED SAUER: It's not $10,000.

00:04:32.480 --> 00:04:34.730
TIMOTHY JORDAN: It's $10,000.

00:04:34.730 --> 00:04:37.410
FRED SAUER: It's the phone I
already have plus Cardboard

00:04:37.410 --> 00:04:38.070
and two lenses.

00:04:38.070 --> 00:04:38.780
TIMOTHY JORDAN: That's awesome.

00:04:38.780 --> 00:04:40.740
FRED SAUER: And a rubber band
to hold the phone in place.

00:04:40.740 --> 00:04:41.770
JOANNA SMITH: That's
the part I like.

00:04:41.770 --> 00:04:43.145
TIMOTHY JORDAN:
What do you think

00:04:43.145 --> 00:04:44.919
is next for developers
with Cardboard?

00:04:44.919 --> 00:04:45.960
Like where is this going?

00:04:45.960 --> 00:04:48.334
FRED SAUER: Really understanding
VR I think is important.

00:04:48.334 --> 00:04:50.880
It's a different experience.

00:04:50.880 --> 00:04:54.280
So we have an app in the App
Store called the Cardboard

00:04:54.280 --> 00:04:55.134
Design Lab.

00:04:55.134 --> 00:04:56.800
If you're doing
anything with Cardboard,

00:04:56.800 --> 00:04:58.200
you've got to check it out.

00:04:58.200 --> 00:05:01.380
It's best practices, and it
shows you what to do and what

00:05:01.380 --> 00:05:05.485
not to do, like what makes
people sick and what doesn't.

00:05:05.485 --> 00:05:07.860
TIMOTHY JORDAN: That's like
a whole new design skill set.

00:05:07.860 --> 00:05:09.830
FRED SAUER: Yeah, because
this is so immersive.

00:05:09.830 --> 00:05:11.180
TIMOTHY JORDAN: And
kind of important.

00:05:11.180 --> 00:05:12.190
FRED SAUER: So you
know that sensation

00:05:12.190 --> 00:05:14.310
if you're sitting in a train,
and then the train next to you

00:05:14.310 --> 00:05:15.005
pulls away?

00:05:15.005 --> 00:05:18.250
And just for a moment,
you think you're moving?

00:05:18.250 --> 00:05:19.386
That can happen here too.

00:05:19.386 --> 00:05:20.510
And that can make you sick.

00:05:20.510 --> 00:05:21.040
TIMOTHY JORDAN: OK.

00:05:21.040 --> 00:05:21.920
FRED SAUER: But if
you do it right,

00:05:21.920 --> 00:05:22.960
you have a great experience.

00:05:22.960 --> 00:05:24.376
TIMOTHY JORDAN:
So really learning

00:05:24.376 --> 00:05:27.267
what makes a great VR
app and simple stuff

00:05:27.267 --> 00:05:29.600
like not making people sick,
too, I imagine another best

00:05:29.600 --> 00:05:29.770
practice.

00:05:29.770 --> 00:05:32.120
FRED SAUER: And you have
to try it with Cardboard.

00:05:32.120 --> 00:05:35.030
It's not the same as doing it
on your development machine.

00:05:35.030 --> 00:05:38.069
You have to compile it,
run it, check it out.

00:05:38.069 --> 00:05:40.360
TIMOTHY JORDAN: Cool, thank
you, appreciate those tips.

00:05:40.360 --> 00:05:43.140
Let's jump over to Firebase
and Google App Engine.

00:05:43.140 --> 00:05:46.130
So developers have been
working with Firebase

00:05:46.130 --> 00:05:49.220
with their Android apps and
their iOS apps and so forth.

00:05:49.220 --> 00:05:50.310
But this adds a new layer.

00:05:50.310 --> 00:05:53.440
This is like a back end
intelligence to real time data.

00:05:53.440 --> 00:05:55.921
DAVID EAST: Yeah, it's
funny talking about Firebase

00:05:55.921 --> 00:05:58.170
on the back end of things
because most people are used

00:05:58.170 --> 00:05:59.940
to using it on the front side.

00:05:59.940 --> 00:06:02.450
But what's cool about
that is not everything

00:06:02.450 --> 00:06:05.370
you can do from the phone,
because it's not always on,

00:06:05.370 --> 00:06:07.842
so you can't always be
routinely sending emails,

00:06:07.842 --> 00:06:10.050
or you can't send a push
notification from the phone.

00:06:10.050 --> 00:06:11.870
So those type of
things you can use

00:06:11.870 --> 00:06:15.560
Firebase for because you
spin it up on the server,

00:06:15.560 --> 00:06:18.512
and it's not really like a
server, it's more of a client.

00:06:18.512 --> 00:06:20.470
So I built a ton of apps,
and this is something

00:06:20.470 --> 00:06:22.310
that I do quite frequently.

00:06:22.310 --> 00:06:26.400
And when you spin up this like
smart client that you can trust

00:06:26.400 --> 00:06:29.090
so you can put all of your keys
on there or your certificates,

00:06:29.090 --> 00:06:30.506
and then that way,
it can send out

00:06:30.506 --> 00:06:32.670
push notifications and
response to something

00:06:32.670 --> 00:06:34.040
that happened in Firebase.

00:06:34.040 --> 00:06:36.560
So now you have this client
that's sitting on a server,

00:06:36.560 --> 00:06:38.860
and you have your phone,
and they're totally away

00:06:38.860 --> 00:06:39.820
from each other.

00:06:39.820 --> 00:06:42.180
But yet, at the same time,
they're in total harmony,

00:06:42.180 --> 00:06:44.000
synchronizing the same data.

00:06:44.000 --> 00:06:46.720
FRED SAUER: So you have a
robot client in the cloud?

00:06:46.720 --> 00:06:47.970
JOANNA SMITH: A trusted robot.

00:06:47.970 --> 00:06:49.280
DAVID EAST: A
trusted robot, yeah.

00:06:49.280 --> 00:06:50.155
FRED SAUER: A butler.

00:06:52.260 --> 00:06:55.960
TIMOTHY JORDAN: Your most
trusted robot Jeeves.

00:06:55.960 --> 00:06:57.902
DAVID EAST: Robot
butler as a service.

00:06:57.902 --> 00:06:59.860
TIMOTHY JORDAN: Butler
as a service, very good.

00:06:59.860 --> 00:07:03.140
So that robot can also
do like Cron jobs, right?

00:07:03.140 --> 00:07:04.720
It's not just
responding changes.

00:07:04.720 --> 00:07:06.660
DAVID EAST: Yeah, Cron jobs
is one of the really cool use

00:07:06.660 --> 00:07:08.190
cases because you
can essentially

00:07:08.190 --> 00:07:11.510
set up a Cron job that sends
out like your newsletter email.

00:07:11.510 --> 00:07:13.887
So every whatever
days or every day,

00:07:13.887 --> 00:07:16.095
you can send out the daily
push to all of your users,

00:07:16.095 --> 00:07:18.050
and that's a simple Cron job.

00:07:18.050 --> 00:07:20.829
It queries the database, grabs
the data, and sends it out.

00:07:20.829 --> 00:07:22.120
TIMOTHY JORDAN: That's awesome.

00:07:22.120 --> 00:07:24.164
JOANNA SMITH: So it's a
motivated trusted robot?

00:07:24.164 --> 00:07:24.830
DAVID EAST: Yes.

00:07:24.830 --> 00:07:28.490
FRED SAUER: I want
a robot butler.

00:07:28.490 --> 00:07:31.150
TIMOTHY JORDAN: OK, Joanna,
let's talk about money.

00:07:31.150 --> 00:07:33.594
JOANNA SMITH: Well, specifically
let's talk about shopping

00:07:33.594 --> 00:07:36.010
and how we can spend the money,
like on our robot butlers,

00:07:36.010 --> 00:07:36.400
right?

00:07:36.400 --> 00:07:37.560
FRED SAUER: I would
buy one right now.

00:07:37.560 --> 00:07:38.530
JOANNA SMITH:
Right, well, that's

00:07:38.530 --> 00:07:39.571
why we make money, right?

00:07:39.571 --> 00:07:41.200
To like spend it on things?

00:07:41.200 --> 00:07:42.680
TIMOTHY JORDAN:
And robot butlers.

00:07:42.680 --> 00:07:43.720
JOANNA SMITH: So
specifically, I think

00:07:43.720 --> 00:07:45.330
that Android Pay is going
to exciting for our holiday

00:07:45.330 --> 00:07:45.630
season.

00:07:45.630 --> 00:07:47.129
We can all kind of
agree that that's

00:07:47.129 --> 00:07:49.046
going to change a lot
of in-store experiences.

00:07:49.046 --> 00:07:51.045
TIMOTHY JORDAN: It's
making things a lot easier.

00:07:51.045 --> 00:07:52.450
JOANNA SMITH: So much easier.

00:07:52.450 --> 00:07:53.930
But the thing is
developers aren't really

00:07:53.930 --> 00:07:55.750
looking at that because it
doesn't really affects them,

00:07:55.750 --> 00:07:57.291
and I think that's
kind of a mistake.

00:07:57.291 --> 00:07:59.121
That article was so
great and Sridhar

00:07:59.121 --> 00:08:00.620
said something that
really resonated

00:08:00.620 --> 00:08:03.920
with me, which is that shopping
moments are replacing shopping

00:08:03.920 --> 00:08:05.304
marathons.

00:08:05.304 --> 00:08:06.970
FRED SAUER: What does
that mean exactly?

00:08:06.970 --> 00:08:09.110
JOANNA SMITH: So, if you
think about it, normally,

00:08:09.110 --> 00:08:10.730
you don't spend all
day on Saturday running

00:08:10.730 --> 00:08:12.170
all of your errands,
going to each store

00:08:12.170 --> 00:08:13.030
that you need something from.

00:08:13.030 --> 00:08:15.110
In fact, you probably don't
buy three things in one day

00:08:15.110 --> 00:08:15.610
anymore.

00:08:15.610 --> 00:08:17.776
You realize that you're out
of toothpaste, you order

00:08:17.776 --> 00:08:19.140
more toothpaste online, right?

00:08:19.140 --> 00:08:21.830
Or you're browsing like some
interesting clothes online,

00:08:21.830 --> 00:08:24.020
you impulse buy whichever
looks most interesting.

00:08:24.020 --> 00:08:25.860
FRED SAUER: I think I agree.

00:08:25.860 --> 00:08:28.740
We used to do those marathons,
like weekend was shopping.

00:08:28.740 --> 00:08:30.890
Or I'm from Holland.

00:08:30.890 --> 00:08:32.860
My town was Thursday
evenings were shop.

00:08:32.860 --> 00:08:34.700
JOANNA SMITH: Everybody
would go, right?

00:08:34.700 --> 00:08:35.669
FRED SAUER: The
whole town would go.

00:08:35.669 --> 00:08:36.940
JOANNA SMITH: We
buy as we need now.

00:08:36.940 --> 00:08:38.659
We don't save it up
in a list anymore.

00:08:38.659 --> 00:08:41.260
And I think that if developers
aren't building that

00:08:41.260 --> 00:08:43.669
into their app, if they're
not creating shopping moments,

00:08:43.669 --> 00:08:46.090
they're really missing out on a
golden opportunity to monetize.

00:08:46.090 --> 00:08:47.480
TIMOTHY JORDAN:
Facilitating shopping,

00:08:47.480 --> 00:08:49.060
like I think one
of things that I do

00:08:49.060 --> 00:08:51.010
is I don't keep a
list of books that I'm

00:08:51.010 --> 00:08:52.240
going to read any more.

00:08:52.240 --> 00:08:54.670
I just buy them digitally
right away, right?

00:08:54.670 --> 00:08:56.720
And then I have a
stack of virtual books.

00:08:56.720 --> 00:08:57.840
If I know I'm going
to read the book,

00:08:57.840 --> 00:08:59.548
I might as well get
it now, and then it's

00:08:59.548 --> 00:09:01.090
waiting for me when
I have the time.

00:09:01.090 --> 00:09:03.465
FRED SAUER: So if I recommend
a robot butler book to you,

00:09:03.465 --> 00:09:04.424
you'd buy it right now.

00:09:04.424 --> 00:09:06.464
TIMOTHY JORDAN: What is
it with the robot butler?

00:09:06.464 --> 00:09:06.980
Yes.

00:09:06.980 --> 00:09:08.390
JOANNA SMITH: Do you
have a robot butler?

00:09:08.390 --> 00:09:09.810
FRED SAUER: No, I
said I want one.

00:09:09.810 --> 00:09:11.646
DAVID EAST: We're
working on it, all right?

00:09:11.646 --> 00:09:12.270
FRED SAUER: OK.

00:09:12.270 --> 00:09:14.870
TIMOTHY JORDAN: OK, let's go
to our last clip of the show,

00:09:14.870 --> 00:09:16.830
and that's all
about patent trolls.

00:09:16.830 --> 00:09:18.550
They're lurking out
there just waiting

00:09:18.550 --> 00:09:19.720
to tear down your business.

00:09:19.720 --> 00:09:22.410
And our Senior Policy
Correspondent Derek Slater

00:09:22.410 --> 00:09:24.630
wants to make sure you know
how to protect yourself

00:09:24.630 --> 00:09:26.140
from these strange beasts.

00:09:26.140 --> 00:09:28.920
But first, we asked some of
Google's Student Ambassadors

00:09:28.920 --> 00:09:31.860
to give their best guess
at what patent trolls are.

00:09:31.860 --> 00:09:32.600
Have a look.

00:09:32.600 --> 00:09:36.925
[VIDEO PLAYBACK]

00:09:36.925 --> 00:09:38.550
-I think a patent
troll is probably

00:09:38.550 --> 00:09:42.814
someone who just comes up
with just random things

00:09:42.814 --> 00:09:43.730
and just patents them.

00:09:43.730 --> 00:09:45.521
-And so basically
they're using that patent

00:09:45.521 --> 00:09:50.410
to try and litigate, extracts
some fees, settle out of court,

00:09:50.410 --> 00:09:52.530
and I think they
impede progress a lot.

00:09:52.530 --> 00:09:55.340
-It prevents you
from doing it better

00:09:55.340 --> 00:09:59.100
because of that little
nasty patent they have.

00:09:59.100 --> 00:10:00.070
[END PLAYBACK]

00:10:00.070 --> 00:10:00.820
TIMOTHY JORDAN: That
was really good.

00:10:00.820 --> 00:10:01.290
DEREK SLATER: It
was pretty good.

00:10:01.290 --> 00:10:02.460
TIMOTHY JORDAN: But I know
you can tie it together

00:10:02.460 --> 00:10:03.585
for us-- put a bow on this.

00:10:03.585 --> 00:10:05.150
What is a patent troll?

00:10:05.150 --> 00:10:06.120
DEREK SLATER: Yes, so
they were pretty close.

00:10:06.120 --> 00:10:08.280
Patents are supposed to
encourage innovation.

00:10:08.280 --> 00:10:11.246
What patent trolls do is
they don't invent anything.

00:10:11.246 --> 00:10:12.620
They come up with
some broad idea

00:10:12.620 --> 00:10:13.870
that they get a patent
for, and then they

00:10:13.870 --> 00:10:15.270
go around threatening
to sue people.

00:10:15.270 --> 00:10:17.436
Let me tell you a little
story to make that clearer.

00:10:17.436 --> 00:10:20.450
This guy David Bloom was working
at a Fortune 500 company,

00:10:20.450 --> 00:10:22.040
leaves to become
an app developer,

00:10:22.040 --> 00:10:25.120
to start a company called
Ordrx, where restaurants

00:10:25.120 --> 00:10:26.960
can share their menus,
make it easy to be

00:10:26.960 --> 00:10:28.810
ordered from any app.

00:10:28.810 --> 00:10:31.730
Raises millions of dollars in
VC funding, has 20 employees,

00:10:31.730 --> 00:10:32.870
is going along great.

00:10:32.870 --> 00:10:34.870
And then this patent troll
comes along who says,

00:10:34.870 --> 00:10:36.720
I am the inventor.

00:10:36.720 --> 00:10:41.340
I own a patent on sharing
menus, and he sues David Bloom.

00:10:41.340 --> 00:10:43.700
David Bloom tries to
fight it, but he loses

00:10:43.700 --> 00:10:44.977
clients, who get scared off.

00:10:44.977 --> 00:10:46.560
He loses investors
who get scared off.

00:10:46.560 --> 00:10:49.420
And earlier this year had
to go out of business.

00:10:49.420 --> 00:10:53.085
That's a story unfortunately
of too many app developers

00:10:53.085 --> 00:10:53.960
and small businesses.

00:10:53.960 --> 00:10:57.580
It can cost like $1 million
at least to defend yourself,

00:10:57.580 --> 00:11:00.420
and it's happened to people
who create podcasts, like Marc

00:11:00.420 --> 00:11:01.500
Maron and Adam Carolla.

00:11:01.500 --> 00:11:03.790
It's happened to people who
do online test software.

00:11:03.790 --> 00:11:05.960
It's happened to people
just running Wi-Fi routers.

00:11:05.960 --> 00:11:09.490
Last year there were nearly
3,000 patent troll lawsuits.

00:11:09.490 --> 00:11:11.557
That's up 500% over
the last decade.

00:11:11.557 --> 00:11:12.640
This is a growing problem.

00:11:12.640 --> 00:11:15.010
There are more people like
David Bloom every year.

00:11:15.010 --> 00:11:16.260
TIMOTHY JORDAN: This is crazy.

00:11:16.260 --> 00:11:18.640
They're able to get away with
this time and time again.

00:11:18.640 --> 00:11:22.620
Obviously, there's a growing
industry of patent trolls.

00:11:22.620 --> 00:11:23.799
What can we do to fix this?

00:11:23.799 --> 00:11:25.840
DEREK SLATER: So we need
a better system in place

00:11:25.840 --> 00:11:28.331
for having quality
patents to be issued.

00:11:28.331 --> 00:11:30.330
There needs to be deterrence
built in the system

00:11:30.330 --> 00:11:32.300
so that there's some
penalty if you go and file

00:11:32.300 --> 00:11:35.081
one of these frivolous lawsuits
using one of these bad patents.

00:11:35.081 --> 00:11:36.330
TIMOTHY JORDAN: OK, what else?

00:11:36.330 --> 00:11:39.170
DEREK SLATER: The main
thing that people can do

00:11:39.170 --> 00:11:41.280
is they can go and tell
Congress to fix it.

00:11:41.280 --> 00:11:42.740
That's really where the
fix needs to happen.

00:11:42.740 --> 00:11:44.240
Fortunately, in the
House and the Senate

00:11:44.240 --> 00:11:46.281
there are two bills right
now, the Innovation Act

00:11:46.281 --> 00:11:47.530
and the Patent Act.

00:11:47.530 --> 00:11:49.620
If you go to fixpatents.org,
you can go and tell

00:11:49.620 --> 00:11:52.240
your Congress person, your
senator to go and pass those,

00:11:52.240 --> 00:11:53.740
and hopefully that
will happen soon.

00:11:53.740 --> 00:11:56.620
Those bills, among other
things, would make it

00:11:56.620 --> 00:11:59.350
so that if a patent troll
files a lawsuit and they lose,

00:11:59.350 --> 00:12:01.540
they have to pay the other
side's attorneys fees.

00:12:01.540 --> 00:12:03.248
That would be a good
amount of deterrence

00:12:03.248 --> 00:12:05.438
from just going after and
threatening random people.

00:12:05.438 --> 00:12:06.813
TIMOTHY JORDAN:
All right-- 500%?

00:12:06.813 --> 00:12:09.674
DEREK SLATER: 500%, and
over the last 20 years,

00:12:09.674 --> 00:12:11.590
that's about a half
trillion dollars of damage

00:12:11.590 --> 00:12:12.710
to the US economy.

00:12:12.710 --> 00:12:15.122
Last five years, about
$8 billion in lost VC

00:12:15.122 --> 00:12:16.330
funding due to patent trolls.

00:12:16.330 --> 00:12:17.650
TIMOTHY JORDAN: All right
so go to this website.

00:12:17.650 --> 00:12:19.040
DEREK SLATER: Fixpatents.org.

00:12:19.040 --> 00:12:20.470
TIMOTHY JORDAN: Thanks for
coming on the show, Derek.

00:12:20.470 --> 00:12:21.420
DEREK SLATER: Pleasure.

00:12:21.420 --> 00:12:22.770
TIMOTHY JORDAN: And
that's been our show.

00:12:22.770 --> 00:12:25.311
To say goodbye to the panel,
I'd like to ask them a question.

00:12:25.311 --> 00:12:29.530
What absurd patents are you
going to invent-- or patent,

00:12:29.530 --> 00:12:31.714
I suppose-- in 2016?

00:12:31.714 --> 00:12:34.130
DAVID EAST: So I really want
to make an API that tells you

00:12:34.130 --> 00:12:36.510
when you're hungry
because like I drink

00:12:36.510 --> 00:12:38.350
an ungodly amount of
caffeine every day,

00:12:38.350 --> 00:12:41.280
so I don't always actually
know when I'm truly hungry.

00:12:41.280 --> 00:12:43.720
So I'd like to be able
to build an app that

00:12:43.720 --> 00:12:47.110
detects when I'm hungry,
then orders me food, and then

00:12:47.110 --> 00:12:50.120
just when it arrives, I'm
like, oh, my gosh, I am hungry.

00:12:50.120 --> 00:12:51.487
Thank you, robot butler app.

00:12:51.487 --> 00:12:54.070
TIMOTHY JORDAN: Actually sounds
really useful for coding days.

00:12:54.070 --> 00:12:56.741
FRED SAUER: I would
use those APIs.

00:12:56.741 --> 00:12:59.240
JOANNA SMITH: Should file that
before we release this video.

00:12:59.240 --> 00:12:59.920
DAVID EAST: That's a good idea.

00:12:59.920 --> 00:13:00.940
TIMOTHY JORDAN: OK, Joanna?

00:13:00.940 --> 00:13:01.790
JOANNA SMITH: I'm
going to patent

00:13:01.790 --> 00:13:04.310
the notion of fingernails
that grow in length over time

00:13:04.310 --> 00:13:05.880
and need to be reduced.

00:13:05.880 --> 00:13:08.570
I'm going to make money every
you guys trim your nails.

00:13:08.570 --> 00:13:10.300
TIMOTHY JORDAN: Fred?

00:13:10.300 --> 00:13:14.400
FRED SAUER: I want to
patent pockets with holes.

00:13:14.400 --> 00:13:17.050
Two reasons-- so when
you go to the beach,

00:13:17.050 --> 00:13:18.930
you don't get sand
caught in your pockets.

00:13:18.930 --> 00:13:20.710
And then when you put your
clothes in the laundry,

00:13:20.710 --> 00:13:22.540
you don't accidentally
leave stuff in there

00:13:22.540 --> 00:13:25.200
that goes through the laundry.

00:13:25.200 --> 00:13:27.864
TIMOTHY JORDAN: Pockets where
nothing gets stuck in them.

00:13:27.864 --> 00:13:28.530
FRED SAUER: Yep.

00:13:28.530 --> 00:13:31.071
JOANNA SMITH: But what about
the holding purpose of a pocket?

00:13:31.071 --> 00:13:32.662
FRED SAUER: Oh, no,
that's irrelevant.

00:13:32.662 --> 00:13:33.370
JOANNA SMITH: OK.

00:13:33.370 --> 00:13:36.007
DAVID EAST: I'm going to
owe you a lot of money.

00:13:36.007 --> 00:13:37.840
TIMOTHY JORDAN: Why
would you owe him money?

00:13:37.840 --> 00:13:40.860
DAVID EAST: Because I've got
a lot holes in my pockets.

00:13:40.860 --> 00:13:44.710
TIMOTHY JORDAN: OK,
so please tell us

00:13:44.710 --> 00:13:47.980
about your absurd patent
ideas down in the comments,

00:13:47.980 --> 00:13:50.519
or really any other ideas
you have about the show

00:13:50.519 --> 00:13:52.060
or what we've talked
about, and we'll

00:13:52.060 --> 00:13:53.540
be sure to respond to you.

00:13:53.540 --> 00:13:56.090
Thanks for joining us this week,
and I'll see you next time.

00:13:56.090 --> 00:13:59.820
I'm Timothy Jordan, and this
has been the "Developer Show."
