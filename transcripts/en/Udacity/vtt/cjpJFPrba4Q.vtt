00:00:00.460 --> 00:00:02.730
Welcome to
the Beginning Ruby Nanodegree Program.

00:00:02.730 --> 00:00:03.490
I'm Walter.

00:00:03.490 --> 00:00:04.210
&gt;&gt; I'm Colt.

00:00:04.210 --> 00:00:05.067
&gt;&gt; And I'm Julia.

00:00:05.067 --> 00:00:07.100
&gt;&gt; And we'll be your instructors.

00:00:07.100 --> 00:00:07.880
Nah, I'm just kidding.

00:00:08.900 --> 00:00:11.690
But we are going back to
the basics in this lesson.

00:00:11.690 --> 00:00:14.470
It's time to start putting what
you've learned into context.

00:00:14.470 --> 00:00:17.720
We'll take a second pass at many of the
concepts you're already familiar with,

00:00:17.720 --> 00:00:20.350
but this time with a bit more detail.

00:00:20.350 --> 00:00:22.060
There's a big difference
between understanding

00:00:22.060 --> 00:00:26.770
the fundamentals of programming
with Ruby, and being a Rubyist.

00:00:26.770 --> 00:00:28.750
Each programming language
has its own philosophies and

00:00:28.750 --> 00:00:31.900
ways of thinking about problems,
and Ruby's no different.

00:00:31.900 --> 00:00:33.070
Let's all be Rubyists.
