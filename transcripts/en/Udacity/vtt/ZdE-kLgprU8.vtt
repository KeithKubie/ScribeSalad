00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.000
Well, here's how I solved it--this windmill has access to 1000 W of power, but it loses 400 W,

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:10.000
so that means the usable amount of power is the difference, 600 W.

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:14.000
Well, power is work over time and what's our time going to be

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:17.000
if we're looking for how many kilograms of water we're going to move.

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:20.000
Our time is going to be one day and when you do it at the unit conversion,

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:25.000
you find that one day is equal to 86,400 seconds.

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:28.000
We can solve this equation for the total work this windmill can do,

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:35.000
multiplying both sides by 86,400 and we get a rather huge number of 51,840,000 joules.

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:38.000
So this is the work that can be done in a single day

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:42.000
and this work is just equal to the mass of water times (g) times (h)

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:44.000
because we've already shown that when we lift an object,

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:49.000
and it doesn't matter if that object is a stone or water by a height (h),

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:51.000
this is the work that we have to do.

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:54.000
Well, we know (g) and we know (h), if we solve this equation for (m),

00:00:54.000 --> 00:01:01.000
we find that our windmill can move a total of 864,000 kg of water per day.

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:04.000
Now that we know this number, deciding on how many windmills to build,

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:07.000
just depends on figuring out how quickly water is leaking in.

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:09.000
Now, we've made some assumptions here and these are assumptions

00:01:09.000 --> 99:59:59.000
that I encourage you to talk about in the forums, but for now, I'd like to say, congratulations!
