00:00:01.890 --> 00:00:04.730
All the talk today is about are
we going to see inflation

00:00:04.730 --> 00:00:05.185
or deflation.

00:00:05.185 --> 00:00:08.510
And before we do that, I think
it's really important to get a

00:00:08.510 --> 00:00:11.890
microeconomic level
understanding of why do prices

00:00:11.890 --> 00:00:13.120
increase or decrease.

00:00:13.120 --> 00:00:17.430
We'll do a little example of
me starting a business and

00:00:17.430 --> 00:00:20.690
when do the prices increase or
decrease in that market?

00:00:20.690 --> 00:00:23.970
So let's say I wanted to start
a cupcake factory.

00:00:29.440 --> 00:00:31.340
And then actually in the process
of this video, even

00:00:31.340 --> 00:00:33.730
though this isn't the intent of
this playlist The intent of

00:00:33.730 --> 00:00:36.340
this playlist is eventually for
you to be able to go to

00:00:36.340 --> 00:00:40.000
your econ professor and say, no,
we won't or we will have

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:42.430
inflation or deflation for
reasons x, y, and z.

00:00:42.430 --> 00:00:44.220
But in the process you might
learn a little bit about

00:00:44.220 --> 00:00:47.020
accounting and starting
a cupcake factory.

00:00:47.020 --> 00:00:48.640
So let's say I want to start
a cupcake factory.

00:00:48.640 --> 00:00:51.150
It costs a million
dollars to build.

00:00:57.250 --> 00:01:05.250
And just the economics of the
factory is it costs $500,000 a

00:01:05.250 --> 00:01:07.370
year to operate.

00:01:07.370 --> 00:01:09.910
So that's literally to pay the
electric bills, to have people

00:01:09.910 --> 00:01:13.250
sitting there ready to make
cupcakes, and I have

00:01:13.250 --> 00:01:16.610
accountants and all the rest.
I have to pay people

00:01:16.610 --> 00:01:18.230
to clean the place.

00:01:18.230 --> 00:01:22.390
Let's say the economics of the
cupcakes themselves-- The cost

00:01:22.390 --> 00:01:26.180
per cupcake is $1.

00:01:26.180 --> 00:01:27.650
Let me do that in red.

00:01:27.650 --> 00:01:30.600
I'll do all of these in red
because these are-- I'll do

00:01:30.600 --> 00:01:32.090
that later.

00:01:32.090 --> 00:01:34.190
So the cost per cupcake
is a dollar.

00:01:38.760 --> 00:01:40.230
And where does that cost?

00:01:40.230 --> 00:01:43.270
Some of it is the incremental--
Let's assume

00:01:43.270 --> 00:01:48.910
that I had a completely
automated, robotic factory.

00:01:48.910 --> 00:01:51.550
Let's say there's very little
labor at my factory.

00:01:51.550 --> 00:01:55.540
And this is just the cost of
ingredients: cream, and sugar,

00:01:55.540 --> 00:01:58.630
and butter, and those little
wax paper things that the

00:01:58.630 --> 00:02:02.230
cupcake is held in, and the
electricity to run my robots,

00:02:02.230 --> 00:02:06.620
and then overtime to kind of
maintain the robots that make

00:02:06.620 --> 00:02:07.870
my factory.

00:02:11.150 --> 00:02:15.330
Let's say I think that I can
charge $2 per cupcake.

00:02:23.370 --> 00:02:29.250
Oh and one other thing, my $1
million factory can produce

00:02:29.250 --> 00:02:35.940
one million cupcakes per year.

00:02:35.940 --> 00:02:37.350
So this is a couple
of exercises.

00:02:37.350 --> 00:02:39.850
Because I'm a businessman, I'm
not just going to plunk down a

00:02:39.850 --> 00:02:43.170
million dollars before
I figure out how

00:02:43.170 --> 00:02:43.950
much money I can make.

00:02:43.950 --> 00:02:45.770
Let's think about how much
money we can make

00:02:45.770 --> 00:02:47.475
in different scenarios.

00:02:47.475 --> 00:02:49.640
Let's call this scenario
one, which is

00:02:49.640 --> 00:02:51.630
kind of the best scenario.

00:02:51.630 --> 00:02:57.450
So call this the optimistic
optimist-- is that I sell a

00:02:57.450 --> 00:02:58.610
million cupcakes.

00:02:58.610 --> 00:03:01.770
So my factory can produce a
million cupcakes and I sell a

00:03:01.770 --> 00:03:04.410
million cupcakes.

00:03:04.410 --> 00:03:09.530
If I sell one million cupcakes--
And I'll take a

00:03:09.530 --> 00:03:11.640
side here because this is
an issue that I want

00:03:11.640 --> 00:03:12.330
to bring up a lot.

00:03:12.330 --> 00:03:14.340
I am fully utilized.

00:03:14.340 --> 00:03:17.570
My factory can produce one
million cupcakes and, in this

00:03:17.570 --> 00:03:20.270
scenario, I'm producing
a million cupcakes.

00:03:20.270 --> 00:03:21.880
So we would say we're
100% utilized.

00:03:21.880 --> 00:03:23.270
How much are you producing
relative to

00:03:23.270 --> 00:03:24.390
what you can produce?

00:03:24.390 --> 00:03:25.540
100%

00:03:25.540 --> 00:03:27.200
So, if I sell a million
cupcakes,

00:03:27.200 --> 00:03:29.560
what would be my revenue?

00:03:29.560 --> 00:03:31.220
And I won't go into the
details of accounting.

00:03:31.220 --> 00:03:35.390
Let me make revenue in green
because that's a good thing.

00:03:35.390 --> 00:03:37.160
So what is my revenue?

00:03:37.160 --> 00:03:39.280
If my background weren't already
black, I would make

00:03:39.280 --> 00:03:40.530
that in black.

00:03:40.530 --> 00:03:43.080
That's why people say being in
the black or being in the red.

00:03:43.080 --> 00:03:44.830
Because being in the black
means you're positive and

00:03:44.830 --> 00:03:46.080
being in the red means
you're negative.

00:03:46.080 --> 00:03:48.180
But my background is black
so I'll use green.

00:03:48.180 --> 00:03:49.900
So we'll say being
in the green.

00:03:49.900 --> 00:03:50.880
So what would be my revenue?

00:03:50.880 --> 00:03:54.260
Well, I'm selling one million
cupcakes and this is my

00:03:54.260 --> 00:03:55.450
optimistic scenario.

00:03:55.450 --> 00:03:59.190
Let's say I actually am able
to charge $2 per cupcake.

00:03:59.190 --> 00:04:01.440
Obviously the whole discussion
is: what happens to this price

00:04:01.440 --> 00:04:04.100
over a bunch of different
scenarios?

00:04:04.100 --> 00:04:07.550
So I am able to charge $2 per
cupcake, so my revenue is

00:04:07.550 --> 00:04:11.540
equal to $2 million per year.

00:04:11.540 --> 00:04:12.630
Right?

00:04:12.630 --> 00:04:15.160
This is a million cupcakes
per year.

00:04:15.160 --> 00:04:16.700
What are my cost of goods?

00:04:19.230 --> 00:04:21.800
And I'll write the common
acronym in there, COGS.

00:04:21.800 --> 00:04:24.280
And this is what you'll see if
you actually look at income

00:04:24.280 --> 00:04:27.930
statements for public
companies.

00:04:27.930 --> 00:04:32.800
You'll see something like cost
of goods or variable costs.

00:04:32.800 --> 00:04:34.857
Usually, actually, cost of goods
or cost of services is

00:04:34.857 --> 00:04:37.030
what you'll see most often.

00:04:37.030 --> 00:04:39.560
So if I have a million
cupcakes-- let me do this in

00:04:39.560 --> 00:04:40.900
red, I said I would
do this in red.

00:04:40.900 --> 00:04:44.930
So I have a million cupcakes
times-- what's my cost per

00:04:44.930 --> 00:04:49.280
cupcake?-- times $1
cost per cupcake.

00:04:49.280 --> 00:04:54.700
So it's $1 million per year.

00:04:54.700 --> 00:04:58.120
And so what is my profit just
from selling the cupcakes?

00:04:58.120 --> 00:05:01.190
Before I think about how much
does it cost for me, all of

00:05:01.190 --> 00:05:02.300
the overhead expenses.

00:05:02.300 --> 00:05:05.650
Just the money I'm getting from
selling the cupcakes, and

00:05:05.650 --> 00:05:07.270
that term is called
gross profit.

00:05:14.050 --> 00:05:15.610
And that's essentially
how much am I

00:05:15.610 --> 00:05:17.360
bringing in from the cupcakes?

00:05:17.360 --> 00:05:20.510
And then how much are just those
cupcakes costing me?

00:05:20.510 --> 00:05:21.310
So I'll do a line here.

00:05:21.310 --> 00:05:23.070
I'll subtract that from that.

00:05:23.070 --> 00:05:27.580
So gross profit, I'm
making $1 million.

00:05:27.580 --> 00:05:29.090
Two minus one.

00:05:29.090 --> 00:05:31.130
You might say, oh
that's great!

00:05:31.130 --> 00:05:32.520
You're making a million dollars
on your cupcake

00:05:32.520 --> 00:05:34.470
factory in this scenario and
oh no, we're not done yet.

00:05:34.470 --> 00:05:36.150
This is just the gross profit.

00:05:36.150 --> 00:05:39.020
This is just the money directly
from the cupcakes.

00:05:39.020 --> 00:05:41.830
I have all of this overhead
expense and often times, on a

00:05:41.830 --> 00:05:44.040
regular income statement, it
will be called selling,

00:05:44.040 --> 00:05:47.130
general and administrative, or
overhead costs, or operating

00:05:47.130 --> 00:05:48.790
costs or something like that.

00:05:48.790 --> 00:05:50.550
I'll just call it overhead.

00:05:50.550 --> 00:05:51.460
I'll make it red because
it's an expense.

00:05:51.460 --> 00:05:55.990
So this should be
red too: COGS.

00:05:55.990 --> 00:05:57.396
So I'll call it overhead.

00:05:57.396 --> 00:06:00.300
So once again, this is kind of
the offices, the accountants,

00:06:00.300 --> 00:06:01.420
the bookkeepers.

00:06:01.420 --> 00:06:06.040
So that's going to be
$500,000 a year.

00:06:06.040 --> 00:06:11.150
And then, how much am I making
from the business now?

00:06:11.150 --> 00:06:12.730
And this is called
operating profit.

00:06:15.240 --> 00:06:18.900
How much am I making from
operating the business?

00:06:18.900 --> 00:06:20.990
And I won't go into all of
the details of an income

00:06:20.990 --> 00:06:23.010
statement, but any income
statement you look at will

00:06:23.010 --> 00:06:24.720
have this operating
profit line.

00:06:24.720 --> 00:06:27.110
And everything below the
operating profit line, just as

00:06:27.110 --> 00:06:29.900
an aside, will kind of cover
things not related to the

00:06:29.900 --> 00:06:31.390
actual operations
of the business.

00:06:31.390 --> 00:06:34.890
It'll be expenses related to
financing the business if I

00:06:34.890 --> 00:06:37.010
took a loan for that million
dollars, or it will be

00:06:37.010 --> 00:06:39.020
expenses related to taxes
and all that.

00:06:39.020 --> 00:06:42.280
But we're just assuming
an ideal world that

00:06:42.280 --> 00:06:43.360
doesn't have taxes.

00:06:43.360 --> 00:06:45.750
And let's say, assume if I
inherited this million

00:06:45.750 --> 00:06:46.920
dollars, I didn't finance it.

00:06:46.920 --> 00:06:49.660
So my operating profit is really
my profit because I

00:06:49.660 --> 00:06:51.230
don't have to pay taxes on it.

00:06:51.230 --> 00:06:53.560
So let's see, I got gross profit
just from selling the

00:06:53.560 --> 00:06:55.300
cupcakes: a million.

00:06:55.300 --> 00:06:58.810
Overhead: the accountants and
the people cleaning the

00:06:58.810 --> 00:06:59.860
factory and et cetera,
et cetera.

00:06:59.860 --> 00:07:01.390
That's $500,000 a year.

00:07:01.390 --> 00:07:05.290
So my operating profit
is $500,000 and

00:07:05.290 --> 00:07:06.550
that's pretty good.

00:07:06.550 --> 00:07:09.900
I had a $1 million investment,
one time investment.

00:07:09.900 --> 00:07:13.120
And I'm assuming that this
$500,000 a year to operate

00:07:13.120 --> 00:07:14.510
also maintains my building.

00:07:14.510 --> 00:07:16.740
So this kind of $1 million
investment will

00:07:16.740 --> 00:07:19.410
exist forever, right?

00:07:19.410 --> 00:07:23.750
And I'm making $500,000 a
year in this scenario.

00:07:23.750 --> 00:07:26.210
So that's a 50% return,
right, which is great.

00:07:26.210 --> 00:07:28.180
If I told you I had an
investment where I could make

00:07:28.180 --> 00:07:31.420
50% a year on your money
you'd say here's my

00:07:31.420 --> 00:07:33.140
money, here's a check.

00:07:33.140 --> 00:07:36.370
But this is, of course, an
optimistic scenario.

00:07:36.370 --> 00:07:37.320
Let's think of other
scenarios.

00:07:37.320 --> 00:07:39.220
There's actually a ton of
scenarios because you can keep

00:07:39.220 --> 00:07:41.720
adjusting how much you sell and
the price you sell it for

00:07:41.720 --> 00:07:43.220
and come up with different
numbers here.

00:07:43.220 --> 00:07:45.590
It's actually a fun exercise to
do in Excel and you could

00:07:45.590 --> 00:07:47.350
do probability distributions
and all that, but I won't

00:07:47.350 --> 00:07:48.690
worry about that right now.

00:07:48.690 --> 00:07:51.170
Let's do a pessemistic--
actually

00:07:51.170 --> 00:07:52.100
let's do this scenario.

00:07:52.100 --> 00:07:54.620
What do I have to do just to
make sure that I don't lose

00:07:54.620 --> 00:07:56.060
money, right?

00:07:56.060 --> 00:07:59.010
So to make sure I don't
lose money, let's

00:07:59.010 --> 00:08:01.560
kind of do it backwards.

00:08:01.560 --> 00:08:04.780
So we're going to do a
break-even analysis.

00:08:04.780 --> 00:08:09.030
And trust me, this will
eventually lead to whether

00:08:09.030 --> 00:08:12.960
we're going to see inflation or
deflation in this economy.

00:08:12.960 --> 00:08:15.760
And I think in the meantime
you might learn a little

00:08:15.760 --> 00:08:19.200
interesting things about
starting a business.

00:08:19.200 --> 00:08:23.770
So let's say I just want to know
what has to happen for my

00:08:23.770 --> 00:08:25.960
operating profit to be zero.

00:08:25.960 --> 00:08:26.170
Right?

00:08:26.170 --> 00:08:28.840
To not be negative, what's the
minimum number of cupcakes I

00:08:28.840 --> 00:08:30.350
need to make or what price
I have to charge.

00:08:30.350 --> 00:08:35.235
So if my operating profit is
zero, we know my overhead.

00:08:38.570 --> 00:08:39.450
This is fixed.

00:08:39.450 --> 00:08:40.135
This is a fixed expense.

00:08:40.135 --> 00:08:41.730
There's nothing I
can do about it.

00:08:41.730 --> 00:08:44.410
If you want to have a
cupcake factory, it

00:08:44.410 --> 00:08:47.410
will cost you $500,000.

00:08:47.410 --> 00:08:48.680
And I'll write it as a negative
number because we're

00:08:48.680 --> 00:08:51.880
going to subtract it from
the gross profit.

00:08:51.880 --> 00:08:53.620
So what does the gross
profit have to be?

00:08:59.160 --> 00:09:01.460
In order for this to come out
to be zero, the gross profit

00:09:01.460 --> 00:09:06.980
has to be $500,000.

00:09:06.980 --> 00:09:10.350
And so now we can think of a
bunch of scenarios where we

00:09:10.350 --> 00:09:13.440
end up with $500,000
gross profit.

00:09:13.440 --> 00:09:19.810
We could, if we sold--
what'd we say?

00:09:19.810 --> 00:09:21.120
So how can we get to $500,000?

00:09:21.120 --> 00:09:24.570
So let's say we're selling, I
don't know, instead of selling

00:09:24.570 --> 00:09:29.930
a million cupcakes we're only
selling 500,000 cupcakes.

00:09:29.930 --> 00:09:31.220
Right this should work out.

00:09:31.220 --> 00:09:36.310
So then our revenue
will be $500,000.

00:09:36.310 --> 00:09:39.310
And let's say I'm still selling
it for $2 a cupcake.

00:09:39.310 --> 00:09:42.020
Times $2.

00:09:42.020 --> 00:09:45.010
So that would be $1 million
of revenue coming into

00:09:45.010 --> 00:09:47.200
the door per year.

00:09:47.200 --> 00:09:50.800
And then my cost of cupcakes,
or my cost of

00:09:50.800 --> 00:09:52.360
goods sold, is what?

00:09:52.360 --> 00:09:54.850
I should be doing this in red,
I'm not being consistent.

00:09:54.850 --> 00:09:57.890
My cost of goods sold is what?

00:09:57.890 --> 00:10:00.480
We said it was a dollar
per cupcake, right?

00:10:00.480 --> 00:10:05.330
So that's 500,000 times $1.

00:10:05.330 --> 00:10:07.700
It would be silly to ever sell
a cupcake for less than a

00:10:07.700 --> 00:10:08.260
dollar, right?

00:10:08.260 --> 00:10:11.040
Then you're just handing
checks out to

00:10:11.040 --> 00:10:12.370
your cupcake eaters.

00:10:12.370 --> 00:10:16.070
But anyway, in this case, my
cost for goods sold would be

00:10:16.070 --> 00:10:17.930
$500,000 and everything
would work out.

00:10:17.930 --> 00:10:22.180
So this is a break-even
scenario, where I sell 500,000

00:10:22.180 --> 00:10:25.030
cupcakes at $2 per cupcake,
with this

00:10:25.030 --> 00:10:27.070
being the cost of goods.

00:10:27.070 --> 00:10:30.830
And then I'll make $500,000
gross profit and then, take

00:10:30.830 --> 00:10:31.740
out the overhead.

00:10:31.740 --> 00:10:34.050
At least I won't make a loss.

00:10:34.050 --> 00:10:36.670
This is interesting because this
tells me, if I'm charging

00:10:36.670 --> 00:10:43.500
$2 per cupcake, I have to sell
at least 500,000 cupcakes to

00:10:43.500 --> 00:10:43.950
make money.

00:10:43.950 --> 00:10:48.380
So you might say, oh yeah, so it
would never be rational to

00:10:48.380 --> 00:10:50.420
sell anything less than
500,000 cupcakes.

00:10:50.420 --> 00:10:51.960
Otherwise you should not
operate the business.

00:10:51.960 --> 00:10:54.240
And what we'll do in future
videos is we'll actually

00:10:54.240 --> 00:10:57.180
explore situations in which
that does happen.

00:10:57.180 --> 00:10:59.000
And in which people start
to kind of cut

00:10:59.000 --> 00:11:01.600
prices to actually compete.

00:11:01.600 --> 00:11:04.160
And in the process they'll be
doing very irrational things.

00:11:04.160 --> 00:11:07.320
But anyway, I realize I've run
out of time in this video.

00:11:07.320 --> 00:11:09.570
I'll see you in the next one
and we'll actually see what

00:11:09.570 --> 00:11:12.540
happens once I start
my cupcake factory.
