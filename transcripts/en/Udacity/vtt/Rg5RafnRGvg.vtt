We want to take, an offline first approach to building

00:00:02.960 --> 00:00:06.290
web apps, where your app can work offline by default.

00:00:06.290 --> 00:00:09.460
Don't be fooled, into thinking offline, can be an afterthought,

00:00:09.460 --> 00:00:12.820
just because we left this lesson to the end. Offline support,

00:00:12.820 --> 00:00:15.940
in the web platform, is a very complex topic, which

00:00:15.940 --> 00:00:19.070
is why we saved to the last. But first, let's

00:00:19.070 --> 00:00:21.810
define, what offline really means. There are a number of

00:00:21.810 --> 00:00:25.500
different scenarios, that can cause someone to be offline. These typically

00:00:25.500 --> 00:00:29.170
boil down, to not having a radio or Wi-Fi connection. But,

00:00:29.170 --> 00:00:32.210
not all of these scenarios, can be detected, by making a connection

00:00:32.210 --> 00:00:34.840
attempt. It's good to keep this in mind and all the

00:00:34.840 --> 00:00:38.330
more reason, to build apps, that treat the network as an enhancement.
