00:00:12.758 --> 00:00:16.500
I'm going to first tell you something that
in my grandmother

00:00:16.524 --> 00:00:19.261
would've elicited a five-oy alarm:

00:00:19.286 --> 00:00:20.548
"Oy-oy-oy-oy-oy."

00:00:20.572 --> 00:00:21.722
(Laughter)

00:00:21.746 --> 00:00:25.031
And here it is ...
are you ready?

00:00:25.522 --> 00:00:26.672
OK.

00:00:27.730 --> 00:00:31.466
I have stage IV lung cancer.

00:00:32.269 --> 00:00:33.571
Oh, I know, "poor me."

00:00:33.595 --> 00:00:34.837
I don't feel that way.

00:00:34.861 --> 00:00:36.912
I'm so OK with it.

00:00:37.380 --> 00:00:39.519
And granted, I have certain advantages --

00:00:39.543 --> 00:00:42.200
not everybody can take
so cavalier an attitude.

00:00:42.224 --> 00:00:43.748
I don't have young children.

00:00:44.355 --> 00:00:48.043
I have a grown daughter who's
brilliant and happy and wonderful.

00:00:48.674 --> 00:00:51.696
I don't have huge financial stress.

00:00:52.711 --> 00:00:54.721
My cancer isn't that aggressive.

00:00:54.745 --> 00:00:56.965
It's kind of like
the Democratic leadership --

00:00:56.989 --> 00:01:00.672
(Laughter)

00:01:00.696 --> 00:01:02.562
not convinced it can win.

00:01:02.586 --> 00:01:04.236
It's basically just sitting there,

00:01:04.260 --> 00:01:06.596
waiting for Goldman Sachs
to give it some money.

00:01:06.620 --> 00:01:07.635
(Laughter)

00:01:07.659 --> 00:01:12.548
(Applause)

00:01:12.572 --> 00:01:15.405
Oh, and the best thing of all --

00:01:15.429 --> 00:01:18.897
I have a major accomplishment
under my belt.

00:01:18.921 --> 00:01:20.072
Yes.

00:01:20.096 --> 00:01:24.000
I didn't even know it until someone
tweeted me a year ago.

00:01:24.024 --> 00:01:26.246
And here's what they said:

00:01:26.270 --> 00:01:28.491
"You are responsible

00:01:28.515 --> 00:01:31.574
for the pussification
of the American male."

00:01:32.039 --> 00:01:33.869
(Laughter)

00:01:33.893 --> 00:01:37.744
(Applause)

00:01:37.768 --> 00:01:40.570
Not that I can take
all the credit, but ...

00:01:40.594 --> 00:01:44.832
(Laughter)

00:01:44.856 --> 00:01:48.785
But what if you don't have my advantages?

00:01:48.809 --> 00:01:52.483
The only advice I can give you
is to do what I did:

00:01:52.507 --> 00:01:55.203
make friends with reality.

00:01:55.634 --> 00:01:59.406
You couldn't have a worse relationship
with reality than I did.

00:02:00.003 --> 00:02:02.491
From the get-go,

00:02:02.515 --> 00:02:04.837
I wasn't even attracted to reality.

00:02:05.376 --> 00:02:08.083
If they'd had Tinder when I met reality,

00:02:08.107 --> 00:02:09.297
I would have swiped left

00:02:09.321 --> 00:02:11.314
and the whole thing would have been over.

00:02:11.338 --> 00:02:13.004
(Laughter)

00:02:13.028 --> 00:02:15.017
And reality and I --

00:02:15.041 --> 00:02:18.436
we don't share the same values,
the same goals --

00:02:18.460 --> 00:02:19.467
(Laughter)

00:02:19.491 --> 00:02:22.190
To be honest, I don't have goals;

00:02:22.214 --> 00:02:23.815
I have fantasies.

00:02:24.388 --> 00:02:28.078
They're exactly like goals
but without the hard work.

00:02:28.102 --> 00:02:30.052
(Laughter)

00:02:30.076 --> 00:02:31.505
(Applause)

00:02:31.529 --> 00:02:34.775
I'm not a big fan of hard work,

00:02:34.799 --> 00:02:36.697
but you know reality --

00:02:36.721 --> 00:02:39.690
it's either push, push, push, push, push

00:02:39.714 --> 00:02:44.027
through its agent,
the executive brain function --

00:02:44.051 --> 00:02:45.596
one of the "yays" of dying:

00:02:45.620 --> 00:02:49.243
my executive brain function
won't have me to kick around anymore.

00:02:49.267 --> 00:02:53.313
(Laughter)

00:02:53.337 --> 00:02:56.642
But something happened

00:02:56.666 --> 00:03:00.871
that made me realize

00:03:00.895 --> 00:03:05.229
that reality may not be reality.

00:03:05.566 --> 00:03:07.088
So what happened was,

00:03:07.112 --> 00:03:11.572
because I basically wanted reality
to leave me alone --

00:03:11.596 --> 00:03:14.589
but I wanted to be left alone
in a nice house

00:03:14.613 --> 00:03:18.379
with a Wolf range
and Sub-Zero refrigerator ...

00:03:18.403 --> 00:03:20.754
private yoga lessons --

00:03:20.778 --> 00:03:24.503
I ended up with
a development deal at Disney.

00:03:24.527 --> 00:03:27.986
And one day I found myself
in my new office

00:03:28.010 --> 00:03:30.325
on Two Dopey Drive --

00:03:30.349 --> 00:03:33.339
(Laughter)

00:03:33.363 --> 00:03:36.443
which reality thought
I should be proud of ...

00:03:36.467 --> 00:03:37.617
(Laughter)

00:03:37.641 --> 00:03:42.047
And I'm staring at the present
they sent me to celebrate my arrival --

00:03:42.071 --> 00:03:47.165
not the Lalique vase or the grand piano
I've heard of other people getting,

00:03:47.189 --> 00:03:50.546
but a three-foot-tall,
stuffed Mickey Mouse

00:03:50.570 --> 00:03:51.585
(Laughter)

00:03:51.609 --> 00:03:54.467
with a catalog, in case I wanted
to order some more stuff

00:03:54.491 --> 00:03:56.495
that didn't jibe with my aesthetic.

00:03:56.519 --> 00:03:57.556
(Laughter)

00:03:57.580 --> 00:03:59.326
And when I looked up in the catalog

00:03:59.350 --> 00:04:03.708
to see how much
this three-foot-high mouse cost,

00:04:03.732 --> 00:04:06.556
here's how it was described ...

00:04:07.603 --> 00:04:09.931
"Life-sized."

00:04:09.955 --> 00:04:14.793
(Laughter)

00:04:14.817 --> 00:04:16.476
And that's when I knew.

00:04:16.878 --> 00:04:19.273
Reality wasn't "reality."

00:04:19.297 --> 00:04:21.255
Reality was an imposter.

00:04:21.937 --> 00:04:26.438
So I dived into quantum physics
and chaos theory

00:04:26.462 --> 00:04:28.608
to try to find actual reality,

00:04:28.632 --> 00:04:30.277
and I've just finished a movie --

00:04:30.301 --> 00:04:32.501
yes, finally finished --

00:04:32.525 --> 00:04:33.703
about all that,

00:04:33.727 --> 00:04:35.032
so I won't go into it here,

00:04:35.056 --> 00:04:37.522
and anyway, it wasn't until
after we shot the movie,

00:04:37.546 --> 00:04:39.608
when I broke my leg
and then it didn't heal,

00:04:39.632 --> 00:04:42.073
so then they had to do
another surgery a year later,

00:04:42.097 --> 00:04:43.468
and then that took a year --

00:04:43.492 --> 00:04:44.749
two years in a wheelchair,

00:04:44.773 --> 00:04:50.723
and that's when I came
into contact with actual reality:

00:04:50.747 --> 00:04:52.112
limits.

00:04:52.598 --> 00:04:55.628
Those very limits I'd spent
my whole life denying

00:04:55.652 --> 00:04:57.965
and pushing past and ignoring

00:04:59.466 --> 00:05:01.033
were real,

00:05:01.057 --> 00:05:03.394
and I had to deal with them,

00:05:03.418 --> 00:05:09.109
and they took imagination,
creativity and my entire skill set.

00:05:09.461 --> 00:05:13.842
It turned out I was great
at actual reality.

00:05:14.289 --> 00:05:16.004
I didn't just come to terms with it,

00:05:16.028 --> 00:05:17.622
I fell in love.

00:05:17.646 --> 00:05:19.107
And I should've known,

00:05:19.131 --> 00:05:23.113
given my equally shaky
relationship with the zeitgeist ...

00:05:24.167 --> 00:05:28.363
I'll just say, if anyone
is in the market for a Betamax --

00:05:28.387 --> 00:05:30.381
(Laughter)

00:05:30.784 --> 00:05:34.632
I should have known that the moment
I fell in love with reality,

00:05:34.656 --> 00:05:37.939
the rest of the country would decide
to go in the opposite direction.

00:05:37.963 --> 00:05:40.272
(Laughter)

00:05:40.296 --> 00:05:44.841
But I'm not here to talk about Trump
or the alt-right or climate-change deniers

00:05:44.865 --> 00:05:47.255
or even the makers of this thing,

00:05:47.279 --> 00:05:49.145
which I would have called a box,

00:05:49.169 --> 00:05:52.054
except that right here, it says,

00:05:52.078 --> 00:05:54.765
"This is not a box."

00:05:54.789 --> 00:05:59.305
(Laughter)

00:05:59.329 --> 00:06:01.467
They're gaslighting me.

00:06:01.491 --> 00:06:03.153
(Laughter)

00:06:03.177 --> 00:06:05.813
(Applause)

00:06:06.701 --> 00:06:11.432
But what I do want to talk about

00:06:11.456 --> 00:06:16.574
is a personal challenge to reality

00:06:16.598 --> 00:06:19.245
that I take personally,

00:06:19.269 --> 00:06:25.946
and I want to preface it
by saying that I absolutely love science.

00:06:26.316 --> 00:06:27.697
I have this --

00:06:27.721 --> 00:06:29.685
not a scientist myself --

00:06:29.709 --> 00:06:34.527
but an uncanny ability to understand
everything about science,

00:06:34.551 --> 00:06:36.434
except the actual science --

00:06:36.458 --> 00:06:37.459
(Laughter)

00:06:37.483 --> 00:06:38.681
which is math.

00:06:38.705 --> 00:06:42.980
But the most outlandish concepts
make sense to me.

00:06:44.968 --> 00:06:46.357
The string theory;

00:06:46.381 --> 00:06:50.549
the idea that all of reality emanates
from the vibrations of these teeny --

00:06:50.573 --> 00:06:52.485
I call it "The Big Twang."

00:06:52.509 --> 00:06:53.768
(Laughter)

00:06:54.405 --> 00:06:56.402
Wave-particle duality:

00:06:56.426 --> 00:07:00.067
the idea that one thing
can manifest as two things ...

00:07:00.091 --> 00:07:01.242
you know?

00:07:01.266 --> 00:07:05.088
That a photon can manifest
as a wave and a particle

00:07:05.112 --> 00:07:07.473
coincided with my deepest intuitions

00:07:07.497 --> 00:07:09.180
that people are good and bad,

00:07:09.204 --> 00:07:11.294
ideas are right and wrong.

00:07:11.318 --> 00:07:13.598
Freud was right about penis envy

00:07:13.622 --> 00:07:16.202
and he was wrong about who has it.

00:07:16.226 --> 00:07:19.815
(Laughter)

00:07:19.839 --> 00:07:22.363
(Applause)

00:07:22.387 --> 00:07:23.630
Thank you.

00:07:23.654 --> 00:07:24.661
(Applause)

00:07:24.685 --> 00:07:28.076
And then there's this slight
variation on that,

00:07:28.100 --> 00:07:30.783
which is reality looks like two things,

00:07:30.807 --> 00:07:34.965
but it turns out to be the interaction
of those two things,

00:07:34.989 --> 00:07:37.137
like space -- time,

00:07:37.161 --> 00:07:38.802
mass -- energy

00:07:38.826 --> 00:07:42.076
and life and death.

00:07:42.444 --> 00:07:43.973
So I don't understand --

00:07:43.997 --> 00:07:47.067
I simply just don't understand

00:07:47.091 --> 00:07:51.456
the mindset of people who are out
to "defeat death" and "overcome death."

00:07:51.480 --> 00:07:53.072
How do you do that?

00:07:53.096 --> 00:07:55.932
How do you defeat death
without killing off life?

00:07:56.539 --> 00:07:58.754
It doesn't make sense to me.

00:07:58.778 --> 00:08:00.710
I also have to say,

00:08:00.734 --> 00:08:04.502
I find it incredibly ungrateful.

00:08:04.526 --> 00:08:07.291
I mean, you're given
this extraordinary gift --

00:08:07.315 --> 00:08:08.701
life --

00:08:08.725 --> 00:08:13.383
but it's as if you had asked Santa
for a Rolls-Royce Silver Shadow

00:08:13.407 --> 00:08:16.119
and you had gotten
a salad spinner instead.

00:08:16.672 --> 00:08:19.020
You know, it's the beef --

00:08:19.044 --> 00:08:22.865
the beef with it is that it comes
with an expiration date.

00:08:22.889 --> 00:08:24.683
Death is the deal breaker.

00:08:25.954 --> 00:08:27.105
I don't get that.

00:08:27.129 --> 00:08:28.280
I don't understand --

00:08:28.304 --> 00:08:29.948
to me, it's disrespectful.

00:08:29.972 --> 00:08:31.855
It's disrespectful to nature.

00:08:32.404 --> 00:08:34.877
The idea that we're going
to dominate nature,

00:08:34.901 --> 00:08:37.083
we're going to master nature,

00:08:37.107 --> 00:08:40.987
nature is too weak
to withstand our intellect --

00:08:41.884 --> 00:08:44.680
no, I don't think so.

00:08:45.055 --> 00:08:48.475
I think if you've actually read
quantum physics as I have --

00:08:48.499 --> 00:08:51.371
well, I read an email
from someone who'd read it, but --

00:08:51.395 --> 00:08:55.268
(Laughter)

00:08:55.292 --> 00:08:56.539
You have to understand

00:08:56.563 --> 00:09:00.396
that we don't live in Newton's
clockwork universe anymore.

00:09:00.420 --> 00:09:03.625
We live in a banana peel universe,

00:09:03.649 --> 00:09:07.329
and we won't ever be able
to know everything

00:09:07.353 --> 00:09:08.999
or control everything

00:09:09.023 --> 00:09:10.506
or predict everything.

00:09:10.530 --> 00:09:12.737
Nature is like a self-driving car.

00:09:12.761 --> 00:09:16.094
The best we can be is like
the old woman in that joke --

00:09:16.118 --> 00:09:17.940
I don't know if you've heard it.

00:09:18.252 --> 00:09:20.575
An old woman is driving

00:09:20.599 --> 00:09:24.828
with her middle-aged daughter
in the passenger seat,

00:09:24.852 --> 00:09:27.251
and the mother goes
right through a red light.

00:09:27.275 --> 00:09:31.451
And the daughter doesn't want to say
anything that makes it sound like,

00:09:31.475 --> 00:09:33.169
"You're too old to drive,"

00:09:33.193 --> 00:09:35.004
so she didn't say anything.

00:09:35.028 --> 00:09:37.752
And then the mother
goes through a second red light,

00:09:37.776 --> 00:09:40.150
and the daughter,
as tactfully as possible,

00:09:40.174 --> 00:09:42.329
says, "Mom, are you aware

00:09:42.353 --> 00:09:44.591
that you just went through
two red lights?"

00:09:44.615 --> 00:09:46.610
And the mother says, "Oh, am I driving?"

00:09:46.634 --> 00:09:50.815
(Laughter)

00:09:50.839 --> 00:09:55.203
(Applause)

00:09:55.227 --> 00:09:56.584
So ...

00:09:58.004 --> 00:10:02.156
and now, I'm going to take a mental leap,

00:10:02.180 --> 00:10:06.069
which is easy for me because
I'm the Evel Knievel of mental leaps;

00:10:06.093 --> 00:10:07.888
my license plate says,

00:10:07.912 --> 00:10:10.552
"Cogito, ergo zoom."

00:10:11.072 --> 00:10:14.439
I hope you're willing
to come with me on this,

00:10:14.463 --> 00:10:20.083
but my real problem with the mindset
that is so out to defeat death

00:10:20.107 --> 00:10:23.867
is if you're anti-death,

00:10:23.891 --> 00:10:26.288
which to me translates as anti-life,

00:10:26.312 --> 00:10:30.173
which to me translates as anti-nature,

00:10:30.197 --> 00:10:33.328
it also translates to me as anti-woman,

00:10:33.352 --> 00:10:37.658
because women have long been
identified with nature.

00:10:37.682 --> 00:10:39.924
And my source on this is Hannah Arendt,

00:10:39.948 --> 00:10:43.575
the German philosopher who wrote
a book called "The Human Condition."

00:10:44.170 --> 00:10:47.609
And in it, she says that classically,

00:10:47.633 --> 00:10:50.299
work is associated with men.

00:10:50.323 --> 00:10:52.533
Work is what comes out of the head;

00:10:52.557 --> 00:10:53.833
it's what we invent,

00:10:53.857 --> 00:10:55.388
it's what we create,

00:10:55.412 --> 00:10:58.052
it's how we leave our mark upon the world.

00:10:59.434 --> 00:11:03.876
Whereas labor is associated with the body.

00:11:03.900 --> 00:11:06.691
It's associated with the people
who perform labor

00:11:06.715 --> 00:11:08.343
or undergo labor.

00:11:08.915 --> 00:11:11.638
So to me,

00:11:11.662 --> 00:11:15.790
the mindset that denies that,

00:11:15.814 --> 00:11:20.127
that denies that we're in sync
with the biorhythms,

00:11:20.151 --> 00:11:23.238
the cyclical rhythms of the universe,

00:11:23.262 --> 00:11:28.916
does not create a hospitable
environment for women

00:11:28.940 --> 00:11:31.374
or for people associated with labor,

00:11:31.398 --> 00:11:32.912
which is to say,

00:11:32.936 --> 00:11:36.355
people that we associate
as descendants of slaves,

00:11:36.379 --> 00:11:38.726
or people who perform manual labor.

00:11:39.838 --> 00:11:45.552
So here's how it looks
from a banana-peel-universe point of view,

00:11:45.576 --> 00:11:48.911
from my mindset, which I call
"Emily's universe."

00:11:49.808 --> 00:11:50.983
First of all,

00:11:52.323 --> 00:11:57.568
I am incredibly grateful for life,

00:11:57.592 --> 00:11:59.659
but I don't want to be immortal.

00:12:00.132 --> 00:12:04.150
I have no interest in having
my name live on after me.

00:12:04.174 --> 00:12:06.353
In fact, I don't want it to,

00:12:06.377 --> 00:12:08.031
because it's been my observation

00:12:08.055 --> 00:12:10.780
that no matter how nice and how brilliant

00:12:10.804 --> 00:12:12.416
or how talented you are,

00:12:12.440 --> 00:12:15.052
50 years after you die, they turn on you.

00:12:15.076 --> 00:12:16.552
(Laughter)

00:12:16.576 --> 00:12:19.091
And I have actual proof of that.

00:12:19.115 --> 00:12:22.347
A headline from the Los Angeles Times:

00:12:22.371 --> 00:12:25.502
"Anne Frank: Not so nice after all."

00:12:25.526 --> 00:12:30.796
(Laughter)

00:12:30.820 --> 00:12:34.182
Plus, I love being in sync

00:12:34.206 --> 00:12:36.725
with the cyclical rhythms of the universe.

00:12:36.749 --> 00:12:39.018
That's what's so extraordinary about life:

00:12:39.042 --> 00:12:41.239
it's a cycle of generation,

00:12:41.263 --> 00:12:42.669
degeneration,

00:12:42.693 --> 00:12:44.292
regeneration.

00:12:44.316 --> 00:12:48.214
"I" am just a collection of particles

00:12:48.238 --> 00:12:51.117
that is arranged into this pattern,

00:12:51.141 --> 00:12:53.903
then will decompose and be available,

00:12:53.927 --> 00:12:56.474
all of its constituent parts, to nature,

00:12:56.498 --> 00:12:58.652
to reorganize into another pattern.

00:12:59.779 --> 00:13:02.238
To me, that is so exciting,

00:13:02.262 --> 00:13:06.670
and it makes me even more grateful
to be part of that process.

00:13:07.331 --> 00:13:09.051
You know,

00:13:09.075 --> 00:13:15.117
I look at death now from the point of view
of a German biologist,

00:13:15.141 --> 00:13:16.596
Andreas Weber,

00:13:16.620 --> 00:13:20.222
who looks at it as part
of the gift economy.

00:13:20.246 --> 00:13:23.024
You're given this enormous gift, life,

00:13:23.048 --> 00:13:25.391
you enrich it as best you can,

00:13:25.415 --> 00:13:27.475
and then you give it back.

00:13:28.019 --> 00:13:31.352
And, you know, Auntie Mame
said, "Life is a banquet" --

00:13:31.376 --> 00:13:33.487
well, I've eaten my fill.

00:13:34.126 --> 00:13:36.397
I have had an enormous appetite for life,

00:13:36.421 --> 00:13:37.644
I've consumed life,

00:13:37.668 --> 00:13:40.303
but in death, I'm going to be consumed.

00:13:40.327 --> 00:13:43.778
I'm going into the ground
just the way I am,

00:13:43.802 --> 00:13:46.753
and there, I invite every microbe

00:13:46.777 --> 00:13:48.133
and detritus-er

00:13:48.157 --> 00:13:50.307
and decomposer

00:13:50.331 --> 00:13:51.497
to have their fill.

00:13:51.521 --> 00:13:54.077
I think they'll find me delicious.

00:13:54.101 --> 00:13:55.303
(Laughter)

00:13:55.327 --> 00:13:56.577
I do.

00:13:57.584 --> 00:14:02.623
So the best thing about my attitude,
I think, is that it's real.

00:14:02.647 --> 00:14:03.973
You can see it.

00:14:03.997 --> 00:14:05.148
You can observe it.

00:14:05.172 --> 00:14:06.638
It actually happens.

00:14:06.662 --> 00:14:10.377
Well, maybe not my enriching the gift,

00:14:10.401 --> 00:14:12.156
I don't know about that --

00:14:12.180 --> 00:14:15.748
but my life has certainly
been enriched by other people.

00:14:15.772 --> 00:14:16.977
By TED,

00:14:17.001 --> 00:14:20.160
which introduced me
to a whole network of people

00:14:20.184 --> 00:14:22.863
who have enriched my life,

00:14:22.887 --> 00:14:26.080
including Tricia McGillis,
my website designer,

00:14:26.104 --> 00:14:28.469
who's working with my wonderful daughter

00:14:28.493 --> 00:14:32.031
to take my website
and turn it into something

00:14:32.055 --> 00:14:33.946
where all I have to do is write a blog.

00:14:33.970 --> 00:14:36.466
I don't have to use
the executive brain function ...

00:14:36.490 --> 00:14:40.069
Ha, ha, ha, I win!

00:14:40.093 --> 00:14:41.192
(Laughter)

00:14:41.216 --> 00:14:43.874
And I am so grateful to you.

00:14:44.853 --> 00:14:47.373
I don't want to say "the audience,"

00:14:47.397 --> 00:14:51.802
because I don't really see it
as we're two separate things.

00:14:51.826 --> 00:14:57.451
I think of it in terms
of quantum physics, again.

00:14:58.001 --> 00:15:03.298
And, you know, quantum physicists
are not exactly sure what happens

00:15:03.322 --> 00:15:05.920
when the wave becomes a particle.

00:15:05.944 --> 00:15:07.483
There are different theories --

00:15:07.507 --> 00:15:09.128
the collapse of the wave function,

00:15:09.152 --> 00:15:10.303
decoherence --

00:15:10.327 --> 00:15:12.043
but they're all agreed on one thing:

00:15:12.067 --> 00:15:15.136
that reality comes into being
through an interaction.

00:15:18.408 --> 00:15:19.821
(Voice breaking) So do you.

00:15:20.628 --> 00:15:22.968
And every audience I've ever had,

00:15:22.992 --> 00:15:24.546
past and present.

00:15:25.508 --> 00:15:29.489
Thank you so much for making my life real.

00:15:29.513 --> 00:15:30.625
(Applause)

00:15:30.649 --> 00:15:31.800
Thank you.

00:15:31.824 --> 00:15:33.284
(Applause)

00:15:33.308 --> 00:15:34.477
Thank you.

00:15:34.501 --> 00:15:35.554
(Applause)

00:15:35.578 --> 00:15:36.737
Thank you.

00:15:36.761 --> 00:15:37.786
(Applause)

00:15:37.810 --> 00:15:38.991
Thank you.
