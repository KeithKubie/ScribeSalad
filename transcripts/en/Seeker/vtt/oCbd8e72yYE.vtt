00:00:00.160 --> 00:00:03.860
There are few things in the world that are
more mysterious than how we come off to other

00:00:03.860 --> 00:00:04.860
people.

00:00:04.860 --> 00:00:05.860
Well, beside sex.

00:00:05.860 --> 00:00:12.580
And black holes...those have always confused
me.

00:00:12.580 --> 00:00:17.289
Hey everyone, Laci Green here for DNews.

00:00:17.289 --> 00:00:20.769
Self awareness can only take you so far in
life, since everyone that you're interacting

00:00:20.769 --> 00:00:22.460
with will interpret you differently.

00:00:22.460 --> 00:00:26.800
Now a new study coming out of Columbia University
is casting light on just how out-of-touch

00:00:26.800 --> 00:00:27.800
we really are.

00:00:27.800 --> 00:00:31.930
The researchers were looking specifically
at the issue of assertiveness; are you as

00:00:31.930 --> 00:00:34.079
assertive as you think you are?

00:00:34.079 --> 00:00:36.690
Participants were paired up to make a deal
with each other, then they were surveyed about

00:00:36.690 --> 00:00:39.480
their own assertiveness as well as their partners.

00:00:39.480 --> 00:00:43.370
For those that *came off as under assertive*,
most of them thought they were appropriately

00:00:43.370 --> 00:00:45.730
pushy, or maybe even too pushy, during the
negotiations.

00:00:45.730 --> 00:00:50.020
For the participants that *came off as overly
pushy*, most of them thought they came off

00:00:50.020 --> 00:00:53.039
us just the right amount or not assertive
enough.

00:00:53.039 --> 00:00:58.030
So, the odds of you correctly assessing how
you come off to others(?) is 50/50.

00:00:58.030 --> 00:01:02.130
Which basically means you could be a JERK
or a PUSHOVER and you'd never know it!

00:01:02.130 --> 00:01:06.040
There's one other important finding though:
those who came off as just the right amount

00:01:06.040 --> 00:01:08.920
of assertive tended to think that they had
been a little too assertive.

00:01:08.920 --> 00:01:13.260
So, when in doubt, be a little more assertive
than you think you should be, and you may

00:01:13.260 --> 00:01:15.840
get closer to striking that golden balance.

00:01:15.840 --> 00:01:18.150
Cash money in the bank baby.

00:01:18.150 --> 00:01:21.330
Assertiveness isn't the only area where our
self perception is a little off.

00:01:21.330 --> 00:01:25.110
Other studies have also found that we tend
to perceive ourselves as more attractive than

00:01:25.110 --> 00:01:28.030
we really are -- something called "self enhancement
bias".

00:01:28.030 --> 00:01:32.250
For the study, researchers took pictures of
participants and subtly photo shopped them

00:01:32.250 --> 00:01:33.550
into several versions.

00:01:33.550 --> 00:01:37.850
When asked to select their original photo,
people selected the one that was enhanced

00:01:37.850 --> 00:01:38.920
to look more attractive.

00:01:38.920 --> 00:01:42.890
When they were selecting photos of a stranger
they had briefly met, the participants picked

00:01:42.890 --> 00:01:44.800
the unmodified photo.

00:01:44.800 --> 00:01:49.100
Self enhancement bias comes into play with
our perception of our own *goodness* as well.

00:01:49.100 --> 00:01:52.500
A study at Cornell found that we overestimate
how charitable we are.

00:01:52.500 --> 00:01:56.570
We consistently estimate that we'll give more
to charity than we actually do.

00:01:56.570 --> 00:01:58.640
We predict others' donations pretty well though.

00:01:58.640 --> 00:02:03.180
Same for our self-perception of voting behavior:
we overestimate our likelihood of do that

00:02:03.180 --> 00:02:04.930
good citizen duty of voting.

00:02:04.930 --> 00:02:09.470
It kind of makes you question your life and
the universe and everything you once knew.

00:02:09.470 --> 00:02:11.440
WHO ARE YOU, IN THIS WORLD?

00:02:11.440 --> 00:02:13.280
I guess you'll never know.

00:02:13.280 --> 00:02:16.450
Thanks for joining me for DNews everyone,
we'll be back later with more science updates.
