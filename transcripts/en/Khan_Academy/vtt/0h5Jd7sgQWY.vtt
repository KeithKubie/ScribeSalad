00:00:00.470 --> 00:00:03.210
Considering that I have a cold
right now, I can't imagine a

00:00:03.210 --> 00:00:08.109
more appropriate topic to make
a video on than a virus.

00:00:08.109 --> 00:00:09.930
And I didn't want to
make it that thick.

00:00:09.930 --> 00:00:11.380
A virus, or viruses.

00:00:14.760 --> 00:00:19.080
And in my opinion, viruses are,
on some level, the most

00:00:19.080 --> 00:00:21.450
fascinating thing in
all of biology.

00:00:21.450 --> 00:00:25.560
Because they really blur the
boundary between what is an

00:00:25.560 --> 00:00:27.440
inanimate object and
what is life?

00:00:30.080 --> 00:00:33.410
I mean if we look at ourselves,
or life as one of

00:00:33.410 --> 00:00:35.210
those things that you know
it when you see it.

00:00:35.210 --> 00:00:39.300
If you see something that,
it's born, it grows, it's

00:00:39.300 --> 00:00:40.460
constantly changing.

00:00:40.460 --> 00:00:41.510
Maybe it moves around.

00:00:41.510 --> 00:00:42.260
Maybe it doesn't.

00:00:42.260 --> 00:00:44.400
But it's metabolizing things
around itself.

00:00:44.400 --> 00:00:46.310
It reproduces and
then it dies.

00:00:46.310 --> 00:00:48.300
You say, hey, that's
probably life.

00:00:48.300 --> 00:00:50.960
And in this, we throw most
things that we see-- or we

00:00:50.960 --> 00:00:52.815
throw in, us.

00:00:52.815 --> 00:00:55.360
We throw in bacteria.

00:00:55.360 --> 00:00:57.120
We throw in plants.

00:00:57.120 --> 00:01:00.830
I mean, I could-- I'm kind of
butchering the taxonomy system

00:01:00.830 --> 00:01:03.275
here, but we tend to know
life when we see it.

00:01:03.275 --> 00:01:07.480
But all viruses are, they're
just a bunch of genetic

00:01:07.480 --> 00:01:09.740
information inside
of a protein.

00:01:09.740 --> 00:01:11.230
Inside of a protein capsule.

00:01:11.230 --> 00:01:13.490
So let me draw.

00:01:13.490 --> 00:01:16.340
And the genetic information
can come in any form.

00:01:16.340 --> 00:01:22.240
So it can be an RNA, it could
be DNA, it could be

00:01:22.240 --> 00:01:24.670
single-stranded RNA,
double-stranded RNA.

00:01:24.670 --> 00:01:27.260
Sometimes for single stranded
they'll write these two little

00:01:27.260 --> 00:01:29.250
S's in front of it.

00:01:29.250 --> 00:01:30.950
Let's say they are talking about
double stranded DNA,

00:01:30.950 --> 00:01:32.910
they'll put a ds
in front of it.

00:01:32.910 --> 00:01:35.330
But the general idea-- and
viruses can come in all of

00:01:35.330 --> 00:01:38.110
these forms-- is that they have
some genetic information,

00:01:38.110 --> 00:01:40.530
some chain of nucleic acids.

00:01:40.530 --> 00:01:43.730
Either as single or double
stranded RNA or single or

00:01:43.730 --> 00:01:44.560
double stranded DNA.

00:01:44.560 --> 00:01:47.970
And it's just contained inside
some type of protein

00:01:47.970 --> 00:01:49.880
structure, which is
called the capsid.

00:01:49.880 --> 00:01:53.240
And kind of the classic
drawing is kind of an

00:01:53.240 --> 00:01:56.650
icosahedron type
looking thing.

00:01:56.650 --> 00:01:58.200
Let me see if I can
do justice to it.

00:01:58.200 --> 00:02:00.610
It looks something like this.

00:02:00.610 --> 00:02:02.800
And not all viruses have to
look exactly like this.

00:02:02.800 --> 00:02:05.160
There's thousands of
types of viruses.

00:02:05.160 --> 00:02:06.850
And we're really just scratching
the surface and

00:02:06.850 --> 00:02:09.630
understanding even what viruses
are out there and all

00:02:09.630 --> 00:02:14.800
of the different ways that they
can essentially replicate

00:02:14.800 --> 00:02:15.220
themselves.

00:02:15.220 --> 00:02:16.620
We'll talk more about
that in the future.

00:02:16.620 --> 00:02:19.110
And I would suspect that pretty
much any possible way

00:02:19.110 --> 00:02:21.530
of replication probably
does somehow exist

00:02:21.530 --> 00:02:22.750
in the virus world.

00:02:22.750 --> 00:02:25.260
But they really are just these
proteins, these protein

00:02:25.260 --> 00:02:27.450
capsids, are just made up
of a bunch of little

00:02:27.450 --> 00:02:29.070
proteins put together.

00:02:29.070 --> 00:02:31.250
And inside they have some
genetic material, which might

00:02:31.250 --> 00:02:33.700
be DNA or it might be RNA.

00:02:33.700 --> 00:02:35.870
So let me draw their
genetic material.

00:02:35.870 --> 00:02:38.420
The protein is not necessarily
transparent, but if it was,

00:02:38.420 --> 00:02:42.960
you would see some genetic
material inside of there.

00:02:42.960 --> 00:02:48.440
So the question is, is
this thing life?

00:02:48.440 --> 00:02:49.580
It seems pretty inanimate.

00:02:49.580 --> 00:02:50.540
It doesn't grow.

00:02:50.540 --> 00:02:51.510
It doesn't change.

00:02:51.510 --> 00:02:53.200
It doesn't metabolize things.

00:02:53.200 --> 00:02:55.200
This thing, left to its
own devices, is just

00:02:55.200 --> 00:02:55.850
going to sit there.

00:02:55.850 --> 00:02:59.600
It's just going to sit there the
way a book on a table just

00:02:59.600 --> 00:03:00.690
sits there.

00:03:00.690 --> 00:03:02.280
It won't change anything.

00:03:02.280 --> 00:03:06.560
But what happens is,
the debate arises.

00:03:06.560 --> 00:03:08.470
I mean you might say, hey Sal,
when you define it that way,

00:03:08.470 --> 00:03:10.690
just looks like a bunch of
molecules put together.

00:03:10.690 --> 00:03:11.740
That isn't life.

00:03:11.740 --> 00:03:14.350
But it starts to seem like life
all of a sudden when it

00:03:14.350 --> 00:03:17.100
comes in contact with the
things that we normally

00:03:17.100 --> 00:03:18.220
consider life.

00:03:18.220 --> 00:03:22.480
So what viruses do, the classic
example is, a virus

00:03:22.480 --> 00:03:24.680
will attach itself to a cell.

00:03:24.680 --> 00:03:28.590
So let me draw this thing
a little bit smaller.

00:03:28.590 --> 00:03:30.260
So let's say that this
is my virus.

00:03:30.260 --> 00:03:32.562
I'll draw it as a
little hexagon.

00:03:32.562 --> 00:03:34.980
And what it does is, it'll
attach itself to a cell.

00:03:34.980 --> 00:03:35.795
And it could be any
type of cell.

00:03:35.795 --> 00:03:39.155
It could be a bacteria cell, it
could be a plant cell, it

00:03:39.155 --> 00:03:41.190
could be a human cell.

00:03:41.190 --> 00:03:43.820
Let me draw the cell here.

00:03:43.820 --> 00:03:48.540
Cells are usually far larger
than the virus.

00:03:48.540 --> 00:03:51.610
In the case of cells that have
soft membranes, the virus

00:03:51.610 --> 00:03:53.850
figures out some way
to enter it.

00:03:53.850 --> 00:03:58.780
Sometimes it can essentially
fuse-- I don't want to

00:03:58.780 --> 00:04:01.390
complicate the issue-- but
sometimes viruses have their

00:04:01.390 --> 00:04:02.480
own little membranes.

00:04:02.480 --> 00:04:03.740
And we'll talk about
in a second where

00:04:03.740 --> 00:04:04.760
it gets their membranes.

00:04:04.760 --> 00:04:08.270
So a virus might have its
own membrane like that.

00:04:08.270 --> 00:04:10.520
That's around its capsid.

00:04:10.520 --> 00:04:13.470
And then these membranes
will fuse.

00:04:13.470 --> 00:04:16.785
And then the virus will be able
to enter into the cell.

00:04:16.785 --> 00:04:18.000
Now, that's one method.

00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:19.670
And another method,
and they're seldom

00:04:19.670 --> 00:04:20.589
all the same way.

00:04:20.589 --> 00:04:24.020
But let's say another method
would be, the virus

00:04:24.020 --> 00:04:26.910
convinces-- just based on some
protein receptors on it, or

00:04:26.910 --> 00:04:29.810
protein receptors on the cells--
and obviously this has

00:04:29.810 --> 00:04:31.650
to be kind of a Trojan
horse type of thing.

00:04:31.650 --> 00:04:33.600
The cell doesn't want viruses.

00:04:33.600 --> 00:04:36.390
So the virus has to somehow
convince the cell that it's a

00:04:36.390 --> 00:04:38.050
non-foreign particle.

00:04:38.050 --> 00:04:41.770
We could do hundreds of videos
on how viruses work and it's a

00:04:41.770 --> 00:04:43.430
continuing field of research.

00:04:43.430 --> 00:04:47.580
But sometimes you might have a
virus that just gets consumed

00:04:47.580 --> 00:04:48.120
by the cell.

00:04:48.120 --> 00:04:49.930
Maybe the cell just thinks it's
something that it needs

00:04:49.930 --> 00:04:50.960
to consume.

00:04:50.960 --> 00:04:53.130
So the cell wraps around
it like this.

00:04:56.780 --> 00:04:58.930
And these sides will
eventually merge.

00:04:58.930 --> 00:05:01.670
And then the cell and the
virus will go into it.

00:05:01.670 --> 00:05:03.160
This is called endocytosis.

00:05:03.160 --> 00:05:04.020
I'll just talk about that.

00:05:04.020 --> 00:05:06.640
It just brings it into
its cytoplasm.

00:05:06.640 --> 00:05:11.020
It doesn't happen
just to viruses.

00:05:11.020 --> 00:05:12.890
But this is one mechanism
that can enter.

00:05:12.890 --> 00:05:17.320
And then in cases where the cell
in question-- for example

00:05:17.320 --> 00:05:20.280
in the situation with bacteria--
if the cell has a

00:05:20.280 --> 00:05:25.520
very hard shell-- let me
do it in a good color.

00:05:25.520 --> 00:05:29.040
So let's say that this is
a bacteria right here.

00:05:29.040 --> 00:05:30.510
And it has a hard shell.

00:05:30.510 --> 00:05:32.830
The viruses don't even
enter the cell.

00:05:32.830 --> 00:05:36.440
They just hang out outside
of the cell like this.

00:05:36.440 --> 00:05:37.740
Not drawing to scale.

00:05:37.740 --> 00:05:40.690
And they actually inject
their genetic material.

00:05:40.690 --> 00:05:43.790
So there's obviously a huge--
there's a wide variety of ways

00:05:43.790 --> 00:05:45.680
of how the viruses
get into cells.

00:05:45.680 --> 00:05:46.780
But that's beside the point.

00:05:46.780 --> 00:05:49.420
The interesting thing is that
they do get into the cell.

00:05:49.420 --> 00:05:52.240
And once they do get into the
cell, they release their

00:05:52.240 --> 00:05:54.570
genetic material
into the cell.

00:05:54.570 --> 00:05:56.970
So their genetic material
will float around.

00:05:56.970 --> 00:06:01.390
If their genetic material is
already in the form of RNA--

00:06:01.390 --> 00:06:05.700
and I could imagine almost every
possibility of different

00:06:05.700 --> 00:06:08.160
ways for viruses to work
probably do exist in nature.

00:06:08.160 --> 00:06:09.400
We just haven't found them.

00:06:09.400 --> 00:06:11.630
But the ones that we've already
found really do kind

00:06:11.630 --> 00:06:13.880
of do it in every
possible way.

00:06:13.880 --> 00:06:20.720
So if they have RNA, this RNA
can immediately start being

00:06:20.720 --> 00:06:23.170
used to essentially-- let's
say this is the

00:06:23.170 --> 00:06:25.540
nucleus of the cell.

00:06:25.540 --> 00:06:28.850
That's the nucleus of the cell
and it normally has the DNA in

00:06:28.850 --> 00:06:29.480
it like that.

00:06:29.480 --> 00:06:30.720
Maybe I'll do the DNA in
a different color.

00:06:30.720 --> 00:06:37.260
But DNA gets transcribed
into RNA, normally.

00:06:37.260 --> 00:06:39.940
So normally, the cell, this a
normal working cell, the RNA

00:06:39.940 --> 00:06:43.540
exits the nucleus, it goes to
the ribosomes, and then you

00:06:43.540 --> 00:06:46.690
have the RNA in conjunction with
the tRNA and it produces

00:06:46.690 --> 00:06:49.260
these proteins.

00:06:49.260 --> 00:06:51.030
The RNA codes for different
proteins.

00:06:51.030 --> 00:06:53.670
And I talk about that in
a different video.

00:06:53.670 --> 00:06:57.000
So these proteins get formed and
eventually, they can form

00:06:57.000 --> 00:06:58.800
the different structures
in a cell.

00:06:58.800 --> 00:07:03.190
But what a virus does is it
hijacks this process here.

00:07:03.190 --> 00:07:04.490
Hijacks this mechanism.

00:07:04.490 --> 00:07:08.550
This RNA will essentially go and
do what the cell's own RNA

00:07:08.550 --> 00:07:09.230
would have done.

00:07:09.230 --> 00:07:11.140
And it starts coding for
its own proteins.

00:07:11.140 --> 00:07:12.250
Obviously it's not
going to code for

00:07:12.250 --> 00:07:13.260
the same things there.

00:07:13.260 --> 00:07:15.790
And actually some of the first
proteins it codes for often

00:07:15.790 --> 00:07:19.670
start killing the DNA and the
RNA that might otherwise

00:07:19.670 --> 00:07:20.380
compete with it.

00:07:20.380 --> 00:07:22.390
So it codes its own proteins.

00:07:22.390 --> 00:07:26.860
And then those proteins start
making more viral shells.

00:07:26.860 --> 00:07:31.520
So those proteins just start
constructing more and more

00:07:31.520 --> 00:07:33.840
viral shells.

00:07:33.840 --> 00:07:36.000
At the same time, this
RNA is replicating.

00:07:36.000 --> 00:07:39.730
It's using the cell's own
mechanisms. Left to its own

00:07:39.730 --> 00:07:40.820
devices it would
just sit there.

00:07:40.820 --> 00:07:43.800
But once it enters into a cell
it can use all of the nice

00:07:43.800 --> 00:07:47.000
machinery that a cell has around
to replicate itself.

00:07:47.000 --> 00:07:51.360
And it's kind of amazing, just
the biochemistry of it.

00:07:51.360 --> 00:07:54.810
That these RNA molecules
then find themselves

00:07:54.810 --> 00:07:57.470
back in these capsids.

00:07:57.470 --> 00:08:00.290
And then once there's enough
of these and the cell has

00:08:00.290 --> 00:08:05.620
essentially all of its resources
have been depleted,

00:08:05.620 --> 00:08:09.990
the viruses, these individual
new viruses that have

00:08:09.990 --> 00:08:15.410
replicated themselves using all
of the cell's mechanisms,

00:08:15.410 --> 00:08:17.370
will find some way
to exit the cell.

00:08:17.370 --> 00:08:20.860
The most-- I don't want to
say, typical, because we

00:08:20.860 --> 00:08:23.110
haven't even discovered all the
different types of viruses

00:08:23.110 --> 00:08:26.750
there are-- but one that's, I
guess, talked about the most,

00:08:26.750 --> 00:08:28.760
is when there's enough of
these, they'll release

00:08:28.760 --> 00:08:30.880
proteins or they'll construct
proteins.

00:08:30.880 --> 00:08:32.390
Because they don't
make their own.

00:08:32.390 --> 00:08:35.860
That essentially cause the cell
to either kill itself or

00:08:35.860 --> 00:08:37.140
its membrane to dissolve.

00:08:37.140 --> 00:08:39.260
So the membrane dissolves.

00:08:39.260 --> 00:08:41.480
And essentially the
cell lyses.

00:08:41.480 --> 00:08:42.409
Let me write that down.

00:08:42.409 --> 00:08:43.840
The cell lyses.

00:08:43.840 --> 00:08:46.110
And lyses just means that
the cell's membrane just

00:08:46.110 --> 00:08:46.900
disappears.

00:08:46.900 --> 00:08:50.480
And then all of these guys can
emerge for themselves.

00:08:50.480 --> 00:08:53.470
Now I talked about before that
have some of these guys, that

00:08:53.470 --> 00:08:54.750
they have their own membrane.

00:08:54.750 --> 00:08:56.710
So how did they get
there, these

00:08:56.710 --> 00:08:58.400
kind of bilipid membranes?

00:08:58.400 --> 00:09:00.900
Well some of them, what they
do is, once they replicate

00:09:00.900 --> 00:09:07.380
inside of a cell, they exit
maybe not even killing-- they

00:09:07.380 --> 00:09:08.650
don't have to lyse.

00:09:08.650 --> 00:09:11.620
Everything I talk about, these
are specific ways that a virus

00:09:11.620 --> 00:09:12.150
might work.

00:09:12.150 --> 00:09:15.630
But viruses really kind of
explore-- well different types

00:09:15.630 --> 00:09:17.620
of viruses do almost every
different combination you

00:09:17.620 --> 00:09:22.610
could imagine of replicating
and coding for proteins and

00:09:22.610 --> 00:09:23.400
escaping from cells.

00:09:23.400 --> 00:09:24.720
Some of them just bud.

00:09:24.720 --> 00:09:26.560
And when they bud, they
essentially, you can kind of

00:09:26.560 --> 00:09:28.070
imagine that they push
against the cell

00:09:28.070 --> 00:09:29.670
wall, or the membrane.

00:09:29.670 --> 00:09:30.740
I shouldn't say cell wall.

00:09:30.740 --> 00:09:32.630
The cell's outer membrane.

00:09:32.630 --> 00:09:36.130
And then when they push against
it, they take some of

00:09:36.130 --> 00:09:38.070
the membrane with them.

00:09:38.070 --> 00:09:41.260
Until eventually the cell
will-- when this goes up

00:09:41.260 --> 00:09:43.810
enough, this'll pop together
and it'll take some of the

00:09:43.810 --> 00:09:44.565
membrane with it.

00:09:44.565 --> 00:09:47.280
And you could imagine why that
would be useful thing

00:09:47.280 --> 00:09:49.030
to have with you.

00:09:49.030 --> 00:09:51.260
Because now that you have this
membrane, you kind of look

00:09:51.260 --> 00:09:52.520
like this cell.

00:09:52.520 --> 00:09:55.300
So when you want to go infect
another cell like this, you're

00:09:55.300 --> 00:09:58.530
not going to necessarily look
like a foreign particle.

00:09:58.530 --> 00:10:02.780
So it's a very useful way to
look like something that

00:10:02.780 --> 00:10:03.470
you're not.

00:10:03.470 --> 00:10:06.940
And if you don't think that this
is creepy-crawly enough,

00:10:06.940 --> 00:10:10.780
that you're hijacking the DNA
of an organism, viruses can

00:10:10.780 --> 00:10:14.740
actually change the
DNA an organism.

00:10:14.740 --> 00:10:18.830
And actually one of the most
common examples is HIV virus.

00:10:18.830 --> 00:10:21.480
Let me write that down.

00:10:21.480 --> 00:10:27.480
HIV, which is a type of
retrovirus, which is

00:10:27.480 --> 00:10:28.280
fascinating.

00:10:28.280 --> 00:10:31.930
Because what they do is, so
they have RNA in them.

00:10:35.810 --> 00:10:38.030
And when they enter into a cell,
let's say that they got

00:10:38.030 --> 00:10:39.430
into the cell.

00:10:39.430 --> 00:10:42.950
So it's inside of the
cell like this.

00:10:42.950 --> 00:10:46.570
They actually bring along
with them a protein.

00:10:46.570 --> 00:10:49.600
And every time you say, where
do they get this protein?

00:10:49.600 --> 00:10:51.390
All of this stuff came from
a different cell.

00:10:51.390 --> 00:10:54.490
They use some other cell's amino
acids and ribosomes and

00:10:54.490 --> 00:10:56.800
nucleic acids and everything
to build themselves.

00:10:56.800 --> 00:10:58.780
So any proteins that they
have in them came

00:10:58.780 --> 00:11:00.080
from another cell.

00:11:00.080 --> 00:11:04.610
But they bring with them, this
protein reverse transcriptase.

00:11:04.610 --> 00:11:07.850
And the reverse transcriptase
takes their RNA and

00:11:07.850 --> 00:11:11.490
codes it into DNA.

00:11:11.490 --> 00:11:14.790
So its RNA to DNA.

00:11:14.790 --> 00:11:16.810
Which when it was first
discovered was, kind of,

00:11:16.810 --> 00:11:19.950
people always thought that you
always went from DNA to RNA,

00:11:19.950 --> 00:11:22.110
but this kind of broke
that paradigm.

00:11:22.110 --> 00:11:23.850
But it codes from RNA to DNA.

00:11:23.850 --> 00:11:29.020
And if that's not bad enough,
it'll incorporate that DNA

00:11:29.020 --> 00:11:31.350
into the DNA of the host cell.

00:11:31.350 --> 00:11:34.500
So that DNA will incorporate
itself into the

00:11:34.500 --> 00:11:35.200
DNA of the host cell.

00:11:35.200 --> 00:11:37.690
Let's say the yellow is the
DNA of the host cell.

00:11:37.690 --> 00:11:41.000
And this is its nucleus.

00:11:41.000 --> 00:11:44.070
So it actually messes with
the genetic makeup

00:11:44.070 --> 00:11:46.030
of what it's infecting.

00:11:46.030 --> 00:11:51.570
And when I made the videos on
bacteria I said, hey for every

00:11:51.570 --> 00:11:53.790
one human cell we have twenty
bacteria cells.

00:11:53.790 --> 00:11:56.420
And they live with us and
they're useful and they're

00:11:56.420 --> 00:12:00.100
part of us and they're 10% of
our dry mass and all of that.

00:12:00.100 --> 00:12:02.170
But bacteria are kind of
along for the ride.

00:12:02.170 --> 00:12:03.860
They don't change who we are.

00:12:03.860 --> 00:12:07.010
But these retroviruses, they're
actually changing our

00:12:07.010 --> 00:12:07.940
genetic makeup.

00:12:07.940 --> 00:12:10.650
I mean, my genes, I take
very personally.

00:12:10.650 --> 00:12:12.380
They define who I am.

00:12:12.380 --> 00:12:14.630
But these guys will
actually go in and

00:12:14.630 --> 00:12:16.240
change my genetic makeup.

00:12:16.240 --> 00:12:19.300
And then once they're part of
the DNA, then just the natural

00:12:19.300 --> 00:12:25.330
DNA to RNA to protein
process will code

00:12:25.330 --> 00:12:27.180
their actual proteins.

00:12:27.180 --> 00:12:30.160
Or their-- what they need to--
so sometimes they'll lay

00:12:30.160 --> 00:12:31.420
dormant and do nothing.

00:12:31.420 --> 00:12:33.730
And sometimes-- let's say
sometimes in some type of

00:12:33.730 --> 00:12:35.790
environmental trigger,
they'll start coding

00:12:35.790 --> 00:12:37.110
for themselves again.

00:12:37.110 --> 00:12:38.620
And they'll start
producing more.

00:12:38.620 --> 00:12:41.980
But they're producing it
directly from the organism's

00:12:41.980 --> 00:12:43.110
cell's DNA.

00:12:43.110 --> 00:12:45.120
They become part of
the organism.

00:12:45.120 --> 00:12:49.280
I mean I can't imagine a more
intimate way to become part of

00:12:49.280 --> 00:12:51.530
an organism than to become
part of its DNA.

00:12:51.530 --> 00:12:52.870
I can't imagine any
other way to

00:12:52.870 --> 00:12:55.680
actually define an organism.

00:12:55.680 --> 00:13:00.910
And if this by itself is not
eerie enough, and just so you

00:13:00.910 --> 00:13:06.770
know, this notion right here,
when a virus becomes part of

00:13:06.770 --> 00:13:09.430
an organism's DNA, this
is called a provirus.

00:13:13.180 --> 00:13:16.890
But if this isn't eerie enough,
they estimate-- so if

00:13:16.890 --> 00:13:23.500
this infects a cell in my nose
or in my arm, as this cell

00:13:23.500 --> 00:13:27.250
experiences mitosis, all of
its offspring-- but its

00:13:27.250 --> 00:13:29.030
offspring are genetically
identical-- are going to have

00:13:29.030 --> 00:13:30.600
this viral DNA.

00:13:30.600 --> 00:13:32.060
And that might be fine,
but at least my

00:13:32.060 --> 00:13:33.120
children won't get it.

00:13:33.120 --> 00:13:35.980
You know, at least it won't
become part of my species.

00:13:35.980 --> 00:13:38.710
But it doesn't have to just
infect somatic cells, it could

00:13:38.710 --> 00:13:41.170
infect a germ cell.

00:13:41.170 --> 00:13:44.510
So it could go into
a germ cell.

00:13:44.510 --> 00:13:46.850
And the germ cells, we've
learned already, these are the

00:13:46.850 --> 00:13:49.380
ones that produce gametes.

00:13:49.380 --> 00:13:52.930
For men, that's sperm and
for women it's eggs.

00:13:52.930 --> 00:13:55.180
But you could imagine, once
you've infected a germ cell,

00:13:55.180 --> 00:13:59.010
once you become part of a germ
cell's DNA, then I'm passing

00:13:59.010 --> 00:14:02.600
on that viral DNA to my
son or my daughter.

00:14:02.600 --> 00:14:05.540
And they are going to pass
it on to their children.

00:14:05.540 --> 00:14:10.260
And just that idea by itself
is, at least to my mind.

00:14:10.260 --> 00:14:12.130
vaguely creepy.

00:14:12.130 --> 00:14:16.050
And people estimate that 5-8%--
and this kind of really

00:14:16.050 --> 00:14:19.480
blurs, it makes you think about
what we as humans really

00:14:19.480 --> 00:14:26.800
are-- but the estimate is 5-8%
of the human genome-- so when

00:14:26.800 --> 00:14:29.500
I talked about bacteria I just
talked about things that were

00:14:29.500 --> 00:14:30.850
along for the ride.

00:14:30.850 --> 00:14:33.240
But the current estimate, and
I looked up this a lot.

00:14:33.240 --> 00:14:35.210
I found 8% someplace,
5% someplace.

00:14:35.210 --> 00:14:35.990
It's all a guess.

00:14:35.990 --> 00:14:37.650
I mean people are doing it based
on just looking at the

00:14:37.650 --> 00:14:40.690
DNA and how similar it is to
DNA in other organisms. But

00:14:40.690 --> 00:14:47.390
the estimate is 5-8% of the
human genome is from viruses,

00:14:47.390 --> 00:14:51.760
is from ancient retroviruses
that incorporated themselves

00:14:51.760 --> 00:14:53.530
into the human germ line.

00:14:53.530 --> 00:14:55.725
So into the human DNA.

00:14:55.725 --> 00:14:57.860
So these are called endogenous
retroviruses.

00:15:04.800 --> 00:15:07.150
Which is mind blowing to me,
because it's not just saying

00:15:07.150 --> 00:15:09.290
these things are along for the
ride or that they might help

00:15:09.290 --> 00:15:10.070
us or hurt us.

00:15:10.070 --> 00:15:14.000
It's saying that we are--
5-8% of our DNA

00:15:14.000 --> 00:15:16.390
actually comes from viruses.

00:15:16.390 --> 00:15:17.850
And this is another thing
that speaks to

00:15:17.850 --> 00:15:19.720
just genetic variation.

00:15:19.720 --> 00:15:24.210
Because viruses do something--
I mean this is called

00:15:24.210 --> 00:15:27.760
horizontal transfer of DNA.

00:15:27.760 --> 00:15:30.480
And you could imagine, as a
virus goes from one species to

00:15:30.480 --> 00:15:37.220
the next, as it goes from
Species A to B, if it mutates

00:15:37.220 --> 00:15:41.310
to be able to infiltrate these
cells, it might take some--

00:15:41.310 --> 00:15:43.810
it'll take the DNA that
it already has, that

00:15:43.810 --> 00:15:45.490
makes it, it with it.

00:15:45.490 --> 00:15:48.180
But sometimes, when it starts
coding for some of these other

00:15:48.180 --> 00:15:52.830
guys, so let's say that this
is a provirus right here.

00:15:52.830 --> 00:15:55.860
Where the blue part is
the original virus.

00:15:55.860 --> 00:16:00.960
The yellow is the organism's
historic DNA.

00:16:00.960 --> 00:16:04.230
Sometimes when it codes, it
takes up little sections of

00:16:04.230 --> 00:16:07.200
the other organism's DNA.

00:16:07.200 --> 00:16:11.810
So maybe most of it was the
viral DNA, but it might have,

00:16:11.810 --> 00:16:14.070
when it transcribed and
translated itself, it might

00:16:14.070 --> 00:16:16.710
have taken a little bit-- or at
least when it translated or

00:16:16.710 --> 00:16:18.460
replicated itself-- it might
take a little bit of the

00:16:18.460 --> 00:16:20.540
organism's previous DNA.

00:16:20.540 --> 00:16:23.690
So it's actually cutting parts
of DNA from one organism and

00:16:23.690 --> 00:16:24.950
bringing it to another
organism.

00:16:24.950 --> 00:16:27.490
Taking it from one member of a
species to another member of

00:16:27.490 --> 00:16:27.810
the species.

00:16:27.810 --> 00:16:29.750
But it can definitely
go cross-species.

00:16:29.750 --> 00:16:32.860
So you have this idea all of
a sudden that DNA can jump

00:16:32.860 --> 00:16:34.090
between species.

00:16:34.090 --> 00:16:36.410
It really kind of-- I don't
know, for me it makes me

00:16:36.410 --> 00:16:39.930
appreciate how interconnected--
as a species,

00:16:39.930 --> 00:16:41.950
we kind of imagine that we're
by ourselves and can only

00:16:41.950 --> 00:16:45.110
reproduce with each other and
have genetic variation within

00:16:45.110 --> 00:16:45.860
a population.

00:16:45.860 --> 00:16:50.190
But viruses introduce this
notion of horizontal transfer

00:16:50.190 --> 00:16:53.090
via transduction.

00:16:53.090 --> 00:16:57.640
Horizontal transduction is just
the idea of, look when I

00:16:57.640 --> 00:17:00.660
replicate this virus, I might
take a little bit of the

00:17:00.660 --> 00:17:04.349
organism that I'm freeloading
off of, I might take a little

00:17:04.349 --> 00:17:06.010
bit of their DNA with me.

00:17:06.010 --> 00:17:09.160
And infect that DNA into
the next organism.

00:17:09.160 --> 00:17:11.329
So you actually have this
DNA, this jumping,

00:17:11.329 --> 00:17:13.119
from organism to organism.

00:17:13.119 --> 00:17:17.300
So it kind of unifies
all DNA-based life.

00:17:17.300 --> 00:17:20.609
Which is all the life that
we know on the planet.

00:17:20.609 --> 00:17:24.900
And if all of this isn't creepy
enough-- and actually

00:17:24.900 --> 00:17:28.540
maybe I'll save the creepiest
part for the end.

00:17:28.540 --> 00:17:30.800
But there's a whole-- we could
talk all about the different

00:17:30.800 --> 00:17:31.670
classes of viruses.

00:17:31.670 --> 00:17:33.810
But just so you're familiar with
some of the terminology,

00:17:33.810 --> 00:17:37.895
when a virus attacks bacteria,
which they often do.

00:17:37.895 --> 00:17:41.150
And we study these the most
because this might be a good

00:17:41.150 --> 00:17:42.630
alternative to antibiotics.

00:17:42.630 --> 00:17:45.430
Because viruses that attack
bacteria might-- sometimes the

00:17:45.430 --> 00:17:47.820
bacteria is far worse for the
virus-- but these are called

00:17:47.820 --> 00:17:49.070
bacteriaphages.

00:17:52.610 --> 00:17:55.320
And I've already talked to you
about how they have their DNA.

00:17:55.320 --> 00:17:57.890
But since bacteria have hard
walls, they will just inject

00:17:57.890 --> 00:18:00.940
the DNA inside of
the bacteria.

00:18:00.940 --> 00:18:06.630
And when you talk about DNA,
this idea of a provirus.

00:18:06.630 --> 00:18:09.170
So when a virus lyses it
like this, this is

00:18:09.170 --> 00:18:11.090
called the lytic cycle.

00:18:11.090 --> 00:18:13.760
This is just some terminology
that's good to know if you're

00:18:13.760 --> 00:18:16.250
going to take a biology
exam about this stuff.

00:18:16.250 --> 00:18:18.600
And when the virus incorporates
it into the DNA

00:18:18.600 --> 00:18:22.350
and lays dormant, incorporates
into the DNA of the host

00:18:22.350 --> 00:18:25.420
organism and lays dormant for
awhile, this is called the

00:18:25.420 --> 00:18:28.030
lysogenic cycle.

00:18:28.030 --> 00:18:32.030
And normally, a provirus is
essentially experiencing a

00:18:32.030 --> 00:18:35.910
lysogenic cycle in eurkaryotes,
in organisms that

00:18:35.910 --> 00:18:38.250
have a nuclear membrane.

00:18:38.250 --> 00:18:40.890
Normally when people talk about
the lysogenic cycle,

00:18:40.890 --> 00:18:44.750
they're talking about viral DNA
laying dormant in the DNA

00:18:44.750 --> 00:18:45.600
of bacteria.

00:18:45.600 --> 00:18:48.600
Or bacteriophage DNA
laying dormant

00:18:48.600 --> 00:18:51.050
in the DNA of bacteria.

00:18:51.050 --> 00:18:53.380
But just to kind of give you
an idea of what this, quote

00:18:53.380 --> 00:18:59.480
unquote, looks like,
right here.

00:18:59.480 --> 00:19:01.550
I got these two pictures
from Wikipedia.

00:19:01.550 --> 00:19:02.800
One is from the CDC.

00:19:11.360 --> 00:19:14.200
These little green dots you see
right here all over the

00:19:14.200 --> 00:19:17.540
surface, this big thing you
see here, this is a white

00:19:17.540 --> 00:19:20.330
blood cell.

00:19:20.330 --> 00:19:21.760
Part of the human
immune system.

00:19:21.760 --> 00:19:23.050
This is a white blood cell.

00:19:27.540 --> 00:19:31.060
And what you see emerging from
the surface, essentially

00:19:31.060 --> 00:19:34.510
budding from the surface of this
white blood cell-- and

00:19:34.510 --> 00:19:36.300
this gives you a sense
of scale too--

00:19:36.300 --> 00:19:39.700
these are HIV-1 viruses.

00:19:39.700 --> 00:19:46.970
And so you're familiar with the
terminology, the HIV is a

00:19:46.970 --> 00:19:51.810
virus that infects white
blood cells.

00:19:51.810 --> 00:19:54.890
AIDS is the syndrome you get
once your immune system is

00:19:54.890 --> 00:19:55.900
weakened to the point.

00:19:55.900 --> 00:19:58.860
And then many people suffer
infections that people with a

00:19:58.860 --> 00:20:01.450
strong immune system normally
won't suffer from.

00:20:01.450 --> 00:20:03.050
But this is creepy.

00:20:03.050 --> 00:20:06.360
These things went inside this
huge cell, they used the

00:20:06.360 --> 00:20:11.555
cell's own mechanism to
reproduce its own DNA or its

00:20:11.555 --> 00:20:14.300
own RNA and these
protein capsids.

00:20:14.300 --> 00:20:16.270
And then they bud from the cell
and take a little bit of

00:20:16.270 --> 00:20:17.490
the membrane with it.

00:20:17.490 --> 00:20:20.990
And they can even leave some
of their DNA behind in this

00:20:20.990 --> 00:20:22.340
cell's own DNA.

00:20:22.340 --> 00:20:25.280
So they really change what
the cell is all about.

00:20:25.280 --> 00:20:26.890
This is another creepy
picture.

00:20:26.890 --> 00:20:28.140
These are bacteriaphages.

00:20:34.500 --> 00:20:36.110
And these show you what
I said before.

00:20:36.110 --> 00:20:38.450
This is a bacteria right here.

00:20:38.450 --> 00:20:41.360
This is its cell wall.

00:20:41.360 --> 00:20:42.100
And it's hard.

00:20:42.100 --> 00:20:45.020
So it's hard to just
emerge into it.

00:20:45.020 --> 00:20:47.040
Or you can't just merge,
fuse membranes with it.

00:20:47.040 --> 00:20:52.290
So they hang out on the outside
of this bacteria.

00:20:52.290 --> 00:20:55.410
And they are essentially
injecting their genetic

00:20:55.410 --> 00:20:58.280
material into the
bacteria itself.

00:20:58.280 --> 00:20:59.890
And you could imagine,
just looking at the

00:20:59.890 --> 00:21:01.000
size of these things.

00:21:01.000 --> 00:21:02.090
I mean, this is a cell.

00:21:02.090 --> 00:21:04.350
And it looks like a whole
planet or something.

00:21:04.350 --> 00:21:05.650
Or this is a bacteria and these

00:21:05.650 --> 00:21:06.620
things are so much smaller.

00:21:06.620 --> 00:21:08.170
Roughly 1/100 of a bacteria.

00:21:08.170 --> 00:21:10.570
And these are much less than
1/100 of this cell we're

00:21:10.570 --> 00:21:11.110
talking about.

00:21:11.110 --> 00:21:15.510
And they're extremely
hard to filter for.

00:21:15.510 --> 00:21:16.520
To kind of keep out.

00:21:16.520 --> 00:21:20.780
Because they are such,
such small particles.

00:21:20.780 --> 00:21:23.290
If you think that these are
exotic things that exist for

00:21:23.290 --> 00:21:31.360
things like HIV or Ebola , which
they do cause, or SARS,

00:21:31.360 --> 00:21:32.340
you're right.

00:21:32.340 --> 00:21:33.730
But they're also
common things.

00:21:33.730 --> 00:21:35.490
I mean, I said at the beginning
of this video that I

00:21:35.490 --> 00:21:36.300
have a cold.

00:21:36.300 --> 00:21:40.040
And I have a cold because some
viruses have infected the

00:21:40.040 --> 00:21:42.610
tissue in my nasal passage.

00:21:42.610 --> 00:21:46.190
And they're causing me to have
a runny nose and whatnot.

00:21:46.190 --> 00:21:48.540
And viruses also cause
the chicken pox.

00:21:48.540 --> 00:21:50.550
They cause the herpes
simplex virus.

00:21:50.550 --> 00:21:51.540
Causes cold sores.

00:21:51.540 --> 00:21:53.430
So they're with us all around.

00:21:53.430 --> 00:21:56.000
I can almost guarantee
you have some virus

00:21:56.000 --> 00:21:57.740
with you as you speak.

00:21:57.740 --> 00:21:58.630
They're all around you.

00:21:58.630 --> 00:22:04.320
But it's a very

00:22:04.320 --> 00:22:06.480
philosophically puzzling question.

00:22:06.480 --> 00:22:09.090
Because I started with, at the
beginning, are these life?

00:22:09.090 --> 00:22:11.495
And at first when I just showed
it to you, look they

00:22:11.495 --> 00:22:13.740
are just this protein
with some nucleic

00:22:13.740 --> 00:22:15.280
acid molecule in it.

00:22:15.280 --> 00:22:16.340
And it's not doing anything.

00:22:16.340 --> 00:22:17.780
And that doesn't look
like life to me.

00:22:17.780 --> 00:22:18.610
It's not moving around.

00:22:18.610 --> 00:22:19.660
It doesn't have a metabolism.

00:22:19.660 --> 00:22:20.390
It's not eating.

00:22:20.390 --> 00:22:21.560
It's not reproducing.

00:22:21.560 --> 00:22:23.120
But then all of a sudden, when
you think about what it's

00:22:23.120 --> 00:22:27.130
doing to cells and how it uses
cells to kind of reproduce.

00:22:27.130 --> 00:22:29.700
It kind of like-- in business
terms it's asset light.

00:22:29.700 --> 00:22:31.920
It doesn't need all of the
machinery because it can use

00:22:31.920 --> 00:22:35.850
other people's machinery
to replicate itself.

00:22:35.850 --> 00:22:38.080
You almost kind of want
to view it as a

00:22:38.080 --> 00:22:39.520
smarter form of life.

00:22:39.520 --> 00:22:42.480
Because it doesn't go through
all of the trouble of what

00:22:42.480 --> 00:22:44.110
every other form of life has.

00:22:44.110 --> 00:22:47.570
It makes you question what life
is, or even what we are.

00:22:47.570 --> 00:22:51.510
Are we these things that contain
DNA or are we just

00:22:51.510 --> 00:22:54.170
transport mechanisms
for the DNA?

00:22:54.170 --> 00:22:56.260
And these are kind of the
more important things.

00:22:56.260 --> 00:22:59.710
And these viral infections are
just battles between different

00:22:59.710 --> 00:23:02.340
forms of DNA and RNA
and whatnot.

00:23:02.340 --> 00:23:04.330
Anyway I don't want to get
too philosophical on you.

00:23:04.330 --> 00:23:08.840
But hopefully this gives you a
good idea of what viruses are

00:23:08.840 --> 00:23:12.940
and why they really are, in my
mind, the most fascinating

00:23:12.940 --> 00:23:15.870
pseudo organism in
all of biology.
