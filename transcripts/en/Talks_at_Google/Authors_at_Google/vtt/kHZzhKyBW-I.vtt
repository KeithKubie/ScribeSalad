00:00:02.105 --> 00:00:05.690
RON: All right,
welcome to authors

00:00:05.690 --> 00:00:08.060
at Google here in Los Angeles.

00:00:08.060 --> 00:00:10.520
Normally we begin author
events with reading

00:00:10.520 --> 00:00:14.280
a short bio of the speaker
downloaded from the internet

00:00:14.280 --> 00:00:16.600
or emailed to us by a publicist.

00:00:16.600 --> 00:00:20.130
Well, I encourage everyone
to google Dr. Daniel Siegel

00:00:20.130 --> 00:00:21.870
and read about the
schools he attended

00:00:21.870 --> 00:00:23.260
and books he published.

00:00:23.260 --> 00:00:26.750
It is perhaps a better use
of the short time allotted

00:00:26.750 --> 00:00:31.140
for introduction to explain
why it is so exciting to have

00:00:31.140 --> 00:00:36.250
Dr. Siegel here at Google
talking about adolescence.

00:00:36.250 --> 00:00:38.060
The other day, a
friend of mine said

00:00:38.060 --> 00:00:41.020
this about his 16-year-old son.

00:00:41.020 --> 00:00:43.970
Two years ago, he said,
we were best buddies.

00:00:43.970 --> 00:00:47.330
Now all I am to him is a
driver and an a ATM machine.

00:00:49.970 --> 00:00:52.830
Another friend offered the
following pearl of wisdom.

00:00:52.830 --> 00:00:55.760
Yes, teenagers want
nothing to do with you,

00:00:55.760 --> 00:00:57.670
and they can't
wait to leave home.

00:00:57.670 --> 00:00:58.630
But don't worry.

00:00:58.630 --> 00:01:01.850
They'll be back when they're 23.

00:01:01.850 --> 00:01:05.470
These two quotes are typical
of how the grownup world views

00:01:05.470 --> 00:01:09.470
adolescents as inaccessible,
a great big black hole,

00:01:09.470 --> 00:01:11.170
a terrible thing we
need to get through

00:01:11.170 --> 00:01:14.820
as best we can until a grownup
emerges on the other side

00:01:14.820 --> 00:01:18.550
and we can finally breathe
a huge sigh of relief.

00:01:18.550 --> 00:01:21.630
Grownups and adolescents find
each other frustrating and

00:01:21.630 --> 00:01:22.900
infuriating.

00:01:22.900 --> 00:01:25.670
I suspect that some
of you are parents

00:01:25.670 --> 00:01:27.850
who came to this
talk hoping for tips

00:01:27.850 --> 00:01:29.790
on how to handle
their teenagers.

00:01:29.790 --> 00:01:33.180
And yes, Daniel Siegel's
book "Brainstorm"

00:01:33.180 --> 00:01:36.090
provides a richness of
insight and practical advice

00:01:36.090 --> 00:01:37.730
to meet that need.

00:01:37.730 --> 00:01:40.910
But what makes this
book truly revolutionary

00:01:40.910 --> 00:01:45.220
is its insistence that
adolescence is not a problem

00:01:45.220 --> 00:01:48.030
to be tackled but
an opportunity,

00:01:48.030 --> 00:01:51.950
an amazing opportunity to be
cultivated and celebrated.

00:01:51.950 --> 00:01:55.580
Those same brain changes that
can cause so much anguish

00:01:55.580 --> 00:01:58.170
have the potential, if
correctly understood,

00:01:58.170 --> 00:02:00.970
to not only be a source
of great satisfaction

00:02:00.970 --> 00:02:02.790
but in fact to
quote from the book,

00:02:02.790 --> 00:02:05.850
"they can enable adolescents
to go on and lead

00:02:05.850 --> 00:02:09.979
great lives of
adventure and purpose."

00:02:09.979 --> 00:02:12.600
Reading the book, you discover
that the aggravation normally

00:02:12.600 --> 00:02:16.200
associated with adolescence
is an unnecessary cost

00:02:16.200 --> 00:02:18.070
of how we deal with it.

00:02:18.070 --> 00:02:19.960
Furthermore, hallmarks
of adolescence

00:02:19.960 --> 00:02:24.590
are youthful energy, creativity,
passion, original thought,

00:02:24.590 --> 00:02:27.560
and a panache for
social connectivity.

00:02:27.560 --> 00:02:33.860
These are resources that are now
wasted on a gargantuan scale.

00:02:33.860 --> 00:02:35.500
A better understanding
of the brain

00:02:35.500 --> 00:02:38.520
can allow adolescents to
make use of these gifts

00:02:38.520 --> 00:02:41.771
towards the making of a better
society and a better world.

00:02:41.771 --> 00:02:43.270
Ladies and gentlemen,
Daniel Siegel.

00:02:46.730 --> 00:02:47.980
DANIEL SIEGEL: Thank you, Ron.

00:02:47.980 --> 00:02:49.715
That was beautiful.

00:02:49.715 --> 00:02:50.340
Thank you, Ron.

00:02:50.340 --> 00:02:51.857
That was really beautiful.

00:02:51.857 --> 00:02:52.940
Can you hear me all right?

00:02:52.940 --> 00:02:53.280
AUDIENCE: Yep.

00:02:53.280 --> 00:02:53.800
DANIEL SIEGEL: Great.

00:02:53.800 --> 00:02:56.230
Well, it's an honor to be
here with you at Google.

00:02:56.230 --> 00:02:59.310
This is my fourth Google
campus that I'm visiting.

00:02:59.310 --> 00:03:02.550
And this one is local, so
it's an easier trip for me.

00:03:02.550 --> 00:03:04.810
So it's really great to be here.

00:03:04.810 --> 00:03:09.130
What I'm going to do is
give you a short overview

00:03:09.130 --> 00:03:11.520
of the ideas in
"Brainstorm: The Power

00:03:11.520 --> 00:03:13.750
and Purpose of
the Teenage Brain"

00:03:13.750 --> 00:03:16.900
and look at some myths
about adolescence

00:03:16.900 --> 00:03:19.600
and what are the actual truths.

00:03:19.600 --> 00:03:22.150
And by understanding
the truths, we actually

00:03:22.150 --> 00:03:24.650
empower adolescents
and adults who

00:03:24.650 --> 00:03:27.850
care for adolescents or
actually any adult who

00:03:27.850 --> 00:03:31.140
once was an adolescent
to actually reclaim

00:03:31.140 --> 00:03:35.260
a certain aspect of celebrating
this period of life.

00:03:35.260 --> 00:03:38.180
So we'll then take
time for a discussion.

00:03:38.180 --> 00:03:41.180
Because if it's like past
experience I've had at Google,

00:03:41.180 --> 00:03:42.830
it's really great
to actually make

00:03:42.830 --> 00:03:46.250
this more interactive
in a discussion period.

00:03:46.250 --> 00:03:48.280
So I'll leave time for that too.

00:03:48.280 --> 00:03:49.780
So first let me
just check with you.

00:03:49.780 --> 00:03:54.040
How many of you have adolescents
at home right at this moment?

00:03:54.040 --> 00:03:57.730
OK, so there's probably
a sense of urgency then.

00:03:57.730 --> 00:03:59.350
How many of you
have younger kids

00:03:59.350 --> 00:04:01.620
at home and you're
getting ready for them

00:04:01.620 --> 00:04:02.930
to turn into adolescents?

00:04:02.930 --> 00:04:05.596
Great, and how many of
you once were adolescents?

00:04:05.596 --> 00:04:06.096
Anyone?

00:04:06.096 --> 00:04:08.660
Great, so that's
pretty much everyone.

00:04:08.660 --> 00:04:11.990
So for myself, I come
from a background where

00:04:11.990 --> 00:04:15.590
basically I trained in
science and biochemistry

00:04:15.590 --> 00:04:18.821
and then went on to medicine
and then became a psychiatrist

00:04:18.821 --> 00:04:20.779
after training initially
in pediatrics and then

00:04:20.779 --> 00:04:24.420
adult psychiatry, became a child
and adolescent psychiatrist.

00:04:24.420 --> 00:04:27.270
And then when I was
trained in research,

00:04:27.270 --> 00:04:30.380
I was really beginning
at the period which

00:04:30.380 --> 00:04:34.180
was called the decade
of the brain, 1990.

00:04:34.180 --> 00:04:36.210
And so it became an
incredible opportunity

00:04:36.210 --> 00:04:38.580
to actually take the
science of the brain

00:04:38.580 --> 00:04:43.830
and try to apply it to practical
clinical use in psychiatry.

00:04:43.830 --> 00:04:46.850
And so I worked to help
create a field called

00:04:46.850 --> 00:04:48.900
interpersonal neurobiology.

00:04:48.900 --> 00:04:51.510
And that field basically takes
all the different disciplines

00:04:51.510 --> 00:04:55.760
of science and puts them
together into one framework.

00:04:55.760 --> 00:04:58.470
And so we have now 36
textbooks that I've

00:04:58.470 --> 00:05:00.440
edited in that series.

00:05:00.440 --> 00:05:03.120
And just to show you
just some examples,

00:05:03.120 --> 00:05:05.410
these are other books besides
the "Brainstorm" book.

00:05:05.410 --> 00:05:06.979
This is basically
just so you know

00:05:06.979 --> 00:05:09.270
where the science we're about
to talk about comes from.

00:05:09.270 --> 00:05:10.860
This is a graduate
school textbook

00:05:10.860 --> 00:05:13.370
that I wrote called "The
Developing Mind," which

00:05:13.370 --> 00:05:15.850
basically takes all these
different fields of science

00:05:15.850 --> 00:05:17.440
and combines them into one.

00:05:17.440 --> 00:05:20.670
If you like non-linear
books, this book,

00:05:20.670 --> 00:05:23.680
"The Interpersonal
Neurobiology Pocket Guide"

00:05:23.680 --> 00:05:26.050
is actually written
in a non-linear way.

00:05:26.050 --> 00:05:28.140
So especially if
it's on a tablet,

00:05:28.140 --> 00:05:30.870
you can bounce around
wherever you feel like going

00:05:30.870 --> 00:05:32.700
and learn all about this field.

00:05:32.700 --> 00:05:36.790
And if you have younger kids,
a book I wrote with my student

00:05:36.790 --> 00:05:38.660
now colleague,
Tina Payne Bryson,

00:05:38.660 --> 00:05:40.140
"The Whole-Brain
Child," will talk

00:05:40.140 --> 00:05:41.514
about a lot of
what we're talking

00:05:41.514 --> 00:05:43.940
about now applied
to younger children.

00:05:43.940 --> 00:05:48.180
So in my own case,
I have not just

00:05:48.180 --> 00:05:51.020
worked in the field of
interpersonal neurobiology

00:05:51.020 --> 00:05:54.690
but also have worked at home
with my partner and wife,

00:05:54.690 --> 00:05:57.190
Caroline Welch,
where we were deeply

00:05:57.190 --> 00:06:00.990
trying to raise our kids,
who are now almost 20 and 24.

00:06:00.990 --> 00:06:02.970
In fact, our son is
traveling around the world,

00:06:02.970 --> 00:06:05.920
and just two days ago I
got back from spending

00:06:05.920 --> 00:06:08.970
two weeks with him after
not seeing him for a year.

00:06:08.970 --> 00:06:09.760
And it's true.

00:06:09.760 --> 00:06:12.460
When they get in their mid-20s,
there's this wonderful change.

00:06:12.460 --> 00:06:14.500
And it was an
incredible opportunity.

00:06:14.500 --> 00:06:17.690
And these kids in their 20s that
we have are still adolescents.

00:06:17.690 --> 00:06:20.230
So the first myth
I want identify

00:06:20.230 --> 00:06:23.210
is that people use
the term adolescents

00:06:23.210 --> 00:06:26.700
synonymously with
the term teenager.

00:06:26.700 --> 00:06:29.180
And that's just not true.

00:06:29.180 --> 00:06:31.420
The adolescent
period can be defined

00:06:31.420 --> 00:06:35.480
as a period between
childhood and adulthood.

00:06:35.480 --> 00:06:37.052
And there was a
debate a while ago,

00:06:37.052 --> 00:06:39.010
should we just get rid
of the term adolescence?

00:06:39.010 --> 00:06:40.070
Is it meaningless?

00:06:40.070 --> 00:06:42.440
Is there just childhood
dependency and then

00:06:42.440 --> 00:06:44.020
adult responsibility?

00:06:44.020 --> 00:06:47.580
But it turns out that not just
in people who live on the West

00:06:47.580 --> 00:06:50.680
Coast or people who are
human beings but actually

00:06:50.680 --> 00:06:53.450
many mammals have an
adolescent period, which

00:06:53.450 --> 00:06:57.100
is distinct from childhood
and distinct from adulthood.

00:06:57.100 --> 00:06:59.750
So it isn't just we
that have this period.

00:06:59.750 --> 00:07:01.754
Now, what is this
period all about?

00:07:01.754 --> 00:07:03.670
Well, it's not just about
having a number that

00:07:03.670 --> 00:07:07.800
begins with teen,
like 19, or 18, or 17.

00:07:07.800 --> 00:07:09.670
It turns out that
there are changes

00:07:09.670 --> 00:07:13.560
in the brain that we didn't
know about before 15 years ago

00:07:13.560 --> 00:07:16.460
that identify that the
adolescent period is more

00:07:16.460 --> 00:07:18.170
than just going
through puberty, which

00:07:18.170 --> 00:07:23.350
is sexual maturation, which
now begins, by the way,

00:07:23.350 --> 00:07:25.880
much earlier than it ever has.

00:07:25.880 --> 00:07:28.186
And the period
following puberty,

00:07:28.186 --> 00:07:29.935
which is the adolescent
period generally--

00:07:29.935 --> 00:07:31.800
it doesn't always
work that way--

00:07:31.800 --> 00:07:37.180
but this period of, if you
will, a developmental time when

00:07:37.180 --> 00:07:39.990
you're not just
dependent on adults

00:07:39.990 --> 00:07:42.770
but you're not just working
with adult responsibility

00:07:42.770 --> 00:07:45.610
of raising a family
or having work.

00:07:45.610 --> 00:07:51.800
This period between has a
certain purpose and power to it

00:07:51.800 --> 00:07:53.970
that we never really
understood before.

00:07:53.970 --> 00:07:56.830
So for many adults,
even when you just

00:07:56.830 --> 00:07:58.975
approach the teenage
years, you say, oh my gosh.

00:07:58.975 --> 00:08:00.350
My kid is going
to be a teenager.

00:08:00.350 --> 00:08:01.850
I don't know what's
going to happen.

00:08:01.850 --> 00:08:03.150
You have a lot of trepidation.

00:08:03.150 --> 00:08:05.870
And what we're about to
do is identify the myths

00:08:05.870 --> 00:08:07.530
that when you
understand them you

00:08:07.530 --> 00:08:10.450
can have celebration,
not trepidation.

00:08:10.450 --> 00:08:13.120
And what are the basic
ways that the brain

00:08:13.120 --> 00:08:17.090
is changing that can identify
these myths and clarify them?

00:08:17.090 --> 00:08:19.830
So the first thing is that
the adolescent period is not

00:08:19.830 --> 00:08:20.870
just the teenage years.

00:08:20.870 --> 00:08:22.420
That's the first myth.

00:08:22.420 --> 00:08:28.560
That changes in the brain happen
between around 12 years of age

00:08:28.560 --> 00:08:30.655
more or less-- a little
bit younger in girls,

00:08:30.655 --> 00:08:33.890
a little bit older in boys,
but it's around the same --

00:08:33.890 --> 00:08:37.740
just around now before
the teenagers begin.

00:08:37.740 --> 00:08:40.530
And it ends in the mid-20s.

00:08:40.530 --> 00:08:42.340
And the ending is of what?

00:08:42.340 --> 00:08:45.330
It's actually of a
period of brain change

00:08:45.330 --> 00:08:47.310
that's called remodeling.

00:08:47.310 --> 00:08:52.410
So this remodeling period is
happening into the mid-20s.

00:08:52.410 --> 00:08:55.730
And by understanding the
nature of the remodeling,

00:08:55.730 --> 00:08:58.370
we actually can understand
a lot about what

00:08:58.370 --> 00:09:00.390
adolescents go through.

00:09:00.390 --> 00:09:04.330
So let's just review very
briefly the brain in general.

00:09:04.330 --> 00:09:06.960
Let's talk about how
the brain interacts

00:09:06.960 --> 00:09:12.190
with culture, and family life,
and interaction with peers.

00:09:12.190 --> 00:09:15.840
And let's look at then why
a child's experience may be

00:09:15.840 --> 00:09:18.850
different from an adolescent's,
which may be different from

00:09:18.850 --> 00:09:19.910
an adult's.

00:09:19.910 --> 00:09:23.590
So Ron was really
nice to actually come

00:09:23.590 --> 00:09:27.710
early this morning and tape
underneath your chair a model

00:09:27.710 --> 00:09:29.820
of the brain that you get
to take home with you.

00:09:29.820 --> 00:09:32.730
So if you reach underneath
your chair with your arm

00:09:32.730 --> 00:09:34.419
and then pull your
arm out, you'll

00:09:34.419 --> 00:09:36.210
notice there's a hand
attached to your arm.

00:09:39.350 --> 00:09:42.610
And this is a handout
for you for today.

00:09:42.610 --> 00:09:45.480
If you fold your thumb in
the middle of your hand

00:09:45.480 --> 00:09:47.410
and fold your
fingers over the top,

00:09:47.410 --> 00:09:49.861
this brain would be oriented
in your hand like that.

00:09:49.861 --> 00:09:52.360
My daughter says, never say
it's a handy model of the brain,

00:09:52.360 --> 00:09:53.920
but it is.

00:09:53.920 --> 00:09:55.960
It's very handy
because it actually

00:09:55.960 --> 00:10:00.780
is a pretty good example of
how the brain is structured.

00:10:00.780 --> 00:10:02.450
So before we get to
the details, let's

00:10:02.450 --> 00:10:05.660
give the first very
brief overview of brain

00:10:05.660 --> 00:10:08.680
anatomy, function,
and development.

00:10:08.680 --> 00:10:11.230
Genes play a very
important role in how

00:10:11.230 --> 00:10:12.980
the basic cells of the
brain, the neurons,

00:10:12.980 --> 00:10:14.570
will link up to each other.

00:10:14.570 --> 00:10:17.380
And even the supportive
cells, the glial cells,

00:10:17.380 --> 00:10:20.645
oligodendrocytes and astrocytes
will perform functions

00:10:20.645 --> 00:10:21.895
that we don't even understand.

00:10:21.895 --> 00:10:25.220
It's a big, big mystery, but
the parts we do understand

00:10:25.220 --> 00:10:26.260
are these.

00:10:26.260 --> 00:10:29.350
That the way neurons
get connected

00:10:29.350 --> 00:10:35.440
influence how you think, how
you feel, and how you behave.

00:10:35.440 --> 00:10:38.880
So thinking, feeling, behavior
is a part of our mental life.

00:10:38.880 --> 00:10:42.160
So in this way, we say that
the structure of the brain

00:10:42.160 --> 00:10:46.480
influences its function, and
the function of the brain

00:10:46.480 --> 00:10:50.030
influences in part mental life.

00:10:50.030 --> 00:10:53.440
So when we say an adolescent's
mental life is changing,

00:10:53.440 --> 00:10:55.580
right away we need to
think in part that's

00:10:55.580 --> 00:10:57.470
due to what's going
on in the body

00:10:57.470 --> 00:10:59.520
and in particular what's
going on in the brain.

00:10:59.520 --> 00:11:02.980
So for a child basically
what happens is this.

00:11:02.980 --> 00:11:05.100
In utero-- and I don't
want to shock anyone--

00:11:05.100 --> 00:11:07.180
but the sperm and
egg get together,

00:11:07.180 --> 00:11:09.600
and they form a
single cell being

00:11:09.600 --> 00:11:14.961
that then becomes 2 cells,
4, 8, 16, 32, 64, et cetera.

00:11:14.961 --> 00:11:16.460
It gets bigger and
bigger and bigger

00:11:16.460 --> 00:11:19.010
until it starts to
specialize in its function.

00:11:19.010 --> 00:11:21.010
Some of those cells will
come from the outside

00:11:21.010 --> 00:11:24.550
and become the neural tube
as they invaginate inward.

00:11:24.550 --> 00:11:26.860
And that's important because
the nervous system, which

00:11:26.860 --> 00:11:30.060
is this neural tube,
starts as skin cells.

00:11:30.060 --> 00:11:32.660
And in fact the skin
is the interface

00:11:32.660 --> 00:11:34.710
of the outer world
and the inner world.

00:11:34.710 --> 00:11:37.150
And your nervous system,
including your brain,

00:11:37.150 --> 00:11:40.282
is always about the interface
of the inner and the outer.

00:11:40.282 --> 00:11:42.490
And that becomes extremely
important in understanding

00:11:42.490 --> 00:11:43.990
adolescence.

00:11:43.990 --> 00:11:46.610
That the nervous system is
basically fancy skin cells,

00:11:46.610 --> 00:11:48.580
if you will, that are
always about saying,

00:11:48.580 --> 00:11:49.650
what's going on inside?

00:11:49.650 --> 00:11:50.770
What's going on outside?

00:11:50.770 --> 00:11:53.700
How do I bring
those two together?

00:11:53.700 --> 00:11:58.130
So what happens in utero
is that this nervous system

00:11:58.130 --> 00:12:01.570
within the body is developing
a lot influenced by genes

00:12:01.570 --> 00:12:05.090
and also of course the
stress of the mom, chemicals

00:12:05.090 --> 00:12:06.930
that the mother may ingest.

00:12:06.930 --> 00:12:08.680
Smoking, drinking,
different things

00:12:08.680 --> 00:12:11.800
can affect the way this nervous
system is going to grow.

00:12:11.800 --> 00:12:15.480
At birth, when we come now to
the structure of the brain,

00:12:15.480 --> 00:12:16.620
let's take a look at it.

00:12:16.620 --> 00:12:18.740
Basically it's
oriented like this.

00:12:18.740 --> 00:12:21.110
The neural tube, the
spinal cord in your back,

00:12:21.110 --> 00:12:23.240
will be represented
by your wrist.

00:12:23.240 --> 00:12:25.450
The clump of neurons that
collects up in the head

00:12:25.450 --> 00:12:28.346
that we'll just call the
brain has three major parts

00:12:28.346 --> 00:12:29.720
that change a lot
in adolescence,

00:12:29.720 --> 00:12:31.886
so we need to review them
to understand adolescence.

00:12:31.886 --> 00:12:33.904
If you lift up your
top area-- try this out

00:12:33.904 --> 00:12:34.820
so you can go with me.

00:12:34.820 --> 00:12:36.810
Lift up your thumb area.

00:12:36.810 --> 00:12:38.630
The first area is
the brain stem.

00:12:38.630 --> 00:12:42.160
And this is the area that
regulates basic bodily

00:12:42.160 --> 00:12:45.130
processes like what's going
on in the heart, the lungs,

00:12:45.130 --> 00:12:46.360
the intestines.

00:12:46.360 --> 00:12:48.700
And it also has
clusters of neurons

00:12:48.700 --> 00:12:52.450
that control the reactive
states of the four F's

00:12:52.450 --> 00:12:53.700
that you may be familiar with.

00:12:53.700 --> 00:12:59.470
Some of them, fight,
flight, freeze, and faint.

00:12:59.470 --> 00:13:00.970
So usually people
say fight, flight,

00:13:00.970 --> 00:13:02.844
but it's actually two
other ones in addition.

00:13:02.844 --> 00:13:05.000
Fight, flight, freeze--
tightening your muscles

00:13:05.000 --> 00:13:06.650
when you're scared--
or fainting where

00:13:06.650 --> 00:13:08.500
you're totally collapsing.

00:13:08.500 --> 00:13:11.050
So those areas are
regulated by the brain stem,

00:13:11.050 --> 00:13:13.130
very old, 300 million year old.

00:13:13.130 --> 00:13:15.920
So it's called the
old reptilian brain.

00:13:15.920 --> 00:13:19.130
And then if you come now
up in evolutionary terms

00:13:19.130 --> 00:13:22.160
and also growing in utero
is the secondary area

00:13:22.160 --> 00:13:24.600
of the brain called the
old mammalian brain.

00:13:24.600 --> 00:13:27.330
You'd have two thumbs for
it to be a perfect model.

00:13:27.330 --> 00:13:30.500
The thumb represent
the limbic area.

00:13:30.500 --> 00:13:33.300
200 million years, it has
regions that you're probably

00:13:33.300 --> 00:13:35.620
familiar with called the
amygdala, the hippocampus,

00:13:35.620 --> 00:13:38.630
the hypothalamus, and
other regions as well.

00:13:38.630 --> 00:13:40.837
The limbic area has
five big functions.

00:13:40.837 --> 00:13:42.420
And we're going to
review them briefly

00:13:42.420 --> 00:13:45.530
because to really
understand adolescents,

00:13:45.530 --> 00:13:47.940
we need to understand what's
going on in the limbic area

00:13:47.940 --> 00:13:51.147
and how it communicates with
the brain stem and the body.

00:13:51.147 --> 00:13:52.230
So here are the functions.

00:13:52.230 --> 00:13:55.414
And I'm going to just
point out how it develops

00:13:55.414 --> 00:13:57.205
and then what changes
in adolescence so you

00:13:57.205 --> 00:13:59.190
can understand it.

00:13:59.190 --> 00:14:01.960
The first thing to say
is that this limbic area

00:14:01.960 --> 00:14:04.960
is going to interact with
what's above it, the cortex,

00:14:04.960 --> 00:14:06.210
we'll talk about later.

00:14:06.210 --> 00:14:09.440
And what's below it, the
brain stem and the body.

00:14:09.440 --> 00:14:12.300
So it's like a way
station that allows

00:14:12.300 --> 00:14:15.150
all these different
inputs to be coordinated.

00:14:15.150 --> 00:14:17.400
So if you're thinking
about what you do at Google

00:14:17.400 --> 00:14:19.655
and how you're influencing
the sharing of energy

00:14:19.655 --> 00:14:22.099
and information across
humanity, in many ways

00:14:22.099 --> 00:14:24.390
the limbic area is going to
serve this kind of function

00:14:24.390 --> 00:14:27.180
of pulling these
different things together.

00:14:27.180 --> 00:14:30.510
So the limbic area is important
in working with the brain

00:14:30.510 --> 00:14:34.040
stem and the body
in creating emotion.

00:14:34.040 --> 00:14:36.990
So when you feel a big
feeling, a big emotion,

00:14:36.990 --> 00:14:39.100
which adolescents
feel more of, it's

00:14:39.100 --> 00:14:43.060
coming from the body, the brain
stem, and the limbic area.

00:14:43.060 --> 00:14:46.310
And because those are all below
this higher area, the cortex,

00:14:46.310 --> 00:14:50.090
it's called the subcortical
source of emotion.

00:14:50.090 --> 00:14:52.970
Which is why when
computer programmers think

00:14:52.970 --> 00:14:55.950
about creating
emotion in a computer,

00:14:55.950 --> 00:14:57.930
I always discuss
with them, well,

00:14:57.930 --> 00:15:00.480
you probably need that
computer to have a body.

00:15:00.480 --> 00:15:02.480
Because to really
really have emotions,

00:15:02.480 --> 00:15:06.210
you need a heart, lungs,
intestine, muscles, bones,

00:15:06.210 --> 00:15:08.830
hormones to have
a true experience

00:15:08.830 --> 00:15:10.840
of what we experience as humans.

00:15:10.840 --> 00:15:14.250
So the body comes up all sorts
of channels, the first layer

00:15:14.250 --> 00:15:16.110
of this spinal cord
called lamina 1.

00:15:16.110 --> 00:15:18.790
The 10th cranial nerve,
all the body input

00:15:18.790 --> 00:15:20.940
comes up to the brain
stem and the limbic area,

00:15:20.940 --> 00:15:22.920
and we get an emotion that way.

00:15:22.920 --> 00:15:24.970
And then it pops up
into our higher areas

00:15:24.970 --> 00:15:27.860
where we have
consciousness, the cortex.

00:15:27.860 --> 00:15:31.890
So these subcortical things in
adolescence are more robust.

00:15:31.890 --> 00:15:34.170
There's a kind of emotional
spark in adolescence.

00:15:34.170 --> 00:15:37.150
So if you compare a
10-year-old to a 14-year-old,

00:15:37.150 --> 00:15:39.010
they're very different
not just that they've

00:15:39.010 --> 00:15:41.090
accumulated four
more years of life.

00:15:41.090 --> 00:15:44.670
But these subcortical
areas are just more active.

00:15:44.670 --> 00:15:47.240
And we'll talk about why that
would be a good thing soon.

00:15:47.240 --> 00:15:48.910
OK, so emotion is number one.

00:15:48.910 --> 00:15:51.380
Number two is motivation.

00:15:51.380 --> 00:15:52.880
The limbic area
works with the brain

00:15:52.880 --> 00:15:55.970
stem to motivate people
to do different things.

00:15:55.970 --> 00:15:58.850
And of course, the
motivation of a 14-year-old,

00:15:58.850 --> 00:16:00.770
as any middle school
teacher will tell you,

00:16:00.770 --> 00:16:02.770
is very different
from a 10-year-old.

00:16:02.770 --> 00:16:05.830
That's because the limbic
area is changing dramatically

00:16:05.830 --> 00:16:07.940
for very important
and good reasons.

00:16:07.940 --> 00:16:09.810
Then when parents
don't understand them,

00:16:09.810 --> 00:16:12.360
they clamp down on what's
happening to the adolescent

00:16:12.360 --> 00:16:14.800
instead of supporting them.

00:16:14.800 --> 00:16:16.599
And what the
"Brainstorm" approach

00:16:16.599 --> 00:16:18.140
that we're going to
talk about can do

00:16:18.140 --> 00:16:21.140
is change our whole
cultural conversation

00:16:21.140 --> 00:16:24.370
so we recognize what's happening
in the brain and support

00:16:24.370 --> 00:16:27.550
adolescents rather than
try to imprison them.

00:16:27.550 --> 00:16:29.620
The third thing the
limbic area is involved in

00:16:29.620 --> 00:16:30.547
is called appraisal.

00:16:30.547 --> 00:16:33.130
Appraisal, and I don't know what
the computer equivalent would

00:16:33.130 --> 00:16:34.940
be, but appraisal
is basically where

00:16:34.940 --> 00:16:38.360
you're evaluating the
significance of something

00:16:38.360 --> 00:16:39.600
happening.

00:16:39.600 --> 00:16:42.320
So the first layer
of appraisal says,

00:16:42.320 --> 00:16:43.910
is this thing
happening something

00:16:43.910 --> 00:16:46.680
I should invest
energy and time in?

00:16:46.680 --> 00:16:49.100
Like right now I'm appraising
my voice is getting hoarse,

00:16:49.100 --> 00:16:51.729
so I'm going to get my water
bottle that my daughter gave me

00:16:51.729 --> 00:16:53.020
before she went away to school.

00:16:57.160 --> 00:16:58.700
And now my limbic
area will appraise

00:16:58.700 --> 00:16:59.830
how did my voice sound?

00:16:59.830 --> 00:17:02.270
And it sounds better,
so I put this down.

00:17:02.270 --> 00:17:03.660
So that would be an appraisal.

00:17:03.660 --> 00:17:05.540
I'm paying attention
to something.

00:17:05.540 --> 00:17:06.950
The second thing
is, is the thing

00:17:06.950 --> 00:17:08.589
I'm paying attention
to good or bad?

00:17:08.589 --> 00:17:10.650
And if it's good, how
do I get more of it?

00:17:10.650 --> 00:17:12.630
If it's bad, how do
I get less of it?

00:17:12.630 --> 00:17:16.442
And those are basic appraisal
functions of the limbic area.

00:17:16.442 --> 00:17:17.400
So that's number three.

00:17:17.400 --> 00:17:19.160
Number four is different
kinds of memory

00:17:19.160 --> 00:17:21.030
are mediated through
the limbic area.

00:17:21.030 --> 00:17:23.230
We won't talk about
that, but the hippocampus

00:17:23.230 --> 00:17:25.690
plays an important
role in creating

00:17:25.690 --> 00:17:28.167
factual memory or
autobiographical memory

00:17:28.167 --> 00:17:30.000
rather than just kind
of the visceral memory

00:17:30.000 --> 00:17:32.190
that you have called
implicit memory.

00:17:32.190 --> 00:17:35.730
And number five is attachment.

00:17:35.730 --> 00:17:38.510
This becomes extremely
important in adolescence.

00:17:38.510 --> 00:17:40.330
Attachment is what
we have as mammals.

00:17:40.330 --> 00:17:42.230
This is the old mammalian brain.

00:17:42.230 --> 00:17:46.780
Attachment is where, as a kid,
you rely on another person,

00:17:46.780 --> 00:17:49.220
your parent usually,
an attachment figure,

00:17:49.220 --> 00:17:51.190
to give you four S's.

00:17:51.190 --> 00:17:53.550
They see you.

00:17:53.550 --> 00:17:55.700
They keep you safe.

00:17:55.700 --> 00:17:57.440
They soothe you.

00:17:57.440 --> 00:17:59.820
And they give you an
internal feeling of security

00:17:59.820 --> 00:18:01.540
if you have the first three.

00:18:01.540 --> 00:18:04.380
So being seen means
someone identifies

00:18:04.380 --> 00:18:06.370
what's going on
beneath your behavior.

00:18:06.370 --> 00:18:09.200
Not just seeing your
body move, but thinking

00:18:09.200 --> 00:18:12.410
about your feelings, identifying
what you're thinking about,

00:18:12.410 --> 00:18:14.710
what has meaning for
you, what your needs are.

00:18:14.710 --> 00:18:16.790
That's what I mean
by being seen.

00:18:16.790 --> 00:18:18.500
Safe means two things.

00:18:18.500 --> 00:18:22.180
They protect you from harm, and
they aren't a source of terror.

00:18:22.180 --> 00:18:25.820
And if they are, they repair
that rupture very quickly.

00:18:25.820 --> 00:18:28.965
Because any parent can lose it,
but if you lose it as a parent,

00:18:28.965 --> 00:18:30.590
and I talk about this
in a book I wrote

00:18:30.590 --> 00:18:34.390
called "Parenting from the
Inside Out" with Mary Hartzell.

00:18:34.390 --> 00:18:36.300
If you lose it and
don't make a repair,

00:18:36.300 --> 00:18:38.840
your child will have a
very negative outcome

00:18:38.840 --> 00:18:41.645
in their attachment category
that they developed.

00:18:41.645 --> 00:18:44.680
And that's explored in
all these different books

00:18:44.680 --> 00:18:46.130
and in "Brainstorm" too.

00:18:46.130 --> 00:18:49.940
So safe means not being
a source of terror

00:18:49.940 --> 00:18:53.950
and also protecting
your child from danger.

00:18:53.950 --> 00:18:57.420
So if you are seen,
and if you are safe,

00:18:57.420 --> 00:19:00.460
and if when you're distressed
you're soothed-- that is,

00:19:00.460 --> 00:19:02.280
I have a really
uncomfortable feeling.

00:19:02.280 --> 00:19:03.560
I'm just a kid.

00:19:03.560 --> 00:19:06.170
I don't know how to get
this feeling to feel better.

00:19:06.170 --> 00:19:08.600
It just feels bad,
whether I'm sad,

00:19:08.600 --> 00:19:11.300
angry, frightened,
whatever it is.

00:19:11.300 --> 00:19:13.587
I go to this other person,
my attachment figure.

00:19:13.587 --> 00:19:14.670
They do something with me.

00:19:14.670 --> 00:19:15.540
They hug me.

00:19:15.540 --> 00:19:16.750
They talk to me.

00:19:16.750 --> 00:19:19.455
They just listen to
me and hear my story.

00:19:19.455 --> 00:19:20.205
And I feel better.

00:19:20.205 --> 00:19:25.210
An attachment figure soothes
the person who's attached.

00:19:25.210 --> 00:19:28.240
OK, so what's so important
about this in adolescence?

00:19:28.240 --> 00:19:30.920
And it's what you
said before, Ron.

00:19:30.920 --> 00:19:33.101
When you're a kid and
you're distressed,

00:19:33.101 --> 00:19:34.350
who do you go to for soothing?

00:19:37.620 --> 00:19:39.760
Your parents, your
attachment figure.

00:19:39.760 --> 00:19:42.860
But when you're an adolescent,
who do you tend to go to?

00:19:42.860 --> 00:19:47.330
Your peers, and that is
a healthy, natural change

00:19:47.330 --> 00:19:50.064
that if a parent is not aware
that this is going to happen,

00:19:50.064 --> 00:19:51.730
they start feeling
left out and rejected

00:19:51.730 --> 00:19:53.640
and think there's
something wrong.

00:19:53.640 --> 00:19:55.480
When in fact it's
something right,

00:19:55.480 --> 00:19:59.040
because overall what the
adolescent is preparing to do

00:19:59.040 --> 00:20:02.130
is to leave home.

00:20:02.130 --> 00:20:04.350
So picture this.

00:20:04.350 --> 00:20:07.370
Just so you can understand
the attachment shift,

00:20:07.370 --> 00:20:09.640
just imagine this scenario.

00:20:09.640 --> 00:20:12.040
You're in bed.

00:20:12.040 --> 00:20:15.200
You're sleeping really deeply.

00:20:15.200 --> 00:20:18.580
The light comes streaming
in through the closed blinds

00:20:18.580 --> 00:20:21.740
of your window, and
someone comes in your room.

00:20:21.740 --> 00:20:23.290
Let's say it's your mom.

00:20:23.290 --> 00:20:25.970
Someone who loves you
like crazy gives you

00:20:25.970 --> 00:20:30.380
a kiss on the forehead and
says, good morning sweetie.

00:20:30.380 --> 00:20:32.920
And you begin to
rouse, and she goes,

00:20:32.920 --> 00:20:35.170
what would you
like for breakfast?

00:20:35.170 --> 00:20:37.150
And you go, I'll have
some oatmeal, mom.

00:20:37.150 --> 00:20:41.770
And she shouts down to your dad,
so-and-so would like oatmeal.

00:20:41.770 --> 00:20:43.480
And so your dad starts
preparing oatmeal.

00:20:43.480 --> 00:20:44.570
You come downstairs.

00:20:44.570 --> 00:20:45.800
You have your pajamas on.

00:20:45.800 --> 00:20:46.900
You have your oatmeal.

00:20:46.900 --> 00:20:48.860
You then get dressed.

00:20:48.860 --> 00:20:50.849
Maybe you watch a
little TV or you

00:20:50.849 --> 00:20:52.140
start getting ready for school.

00:20:52.140 --> 00:20:54.070
Then you go off to preschool.

00:20:54.070 --> 00:20:56.030
And at preschool, you
play with friends,

00:20:56.030 --> 00:20:58.910
and you learn how to share,
and you have a snack,

00:20:58.910 --> 00:21:00.840
and maybe you come
home for lunch.

00:21:00.840 --> 00:21:03.790
You're getting a little
tired, so you take a nap.

00:21:03.790 --> 00:21:07.330
And then you play some
more out in the yard.

00:21:07.330 --> 00:21:09.730
And then you have
another snack, and then

00:21:09.730 --> 00:21:12.010
you dance around with
your mom, or your dad,

00:21:12.010 --> 00:21:13.060
or who's ever there.

00:21:13.060 --> 00:21:14.435
And then you get
a little hungry,

00:21:14.435 --> 00:21:15.616
so they make you dinner.

00:21:15.616 --> 00:21:17.240
And then you're
getting a little tired.

00:21:17.240 --> 00:21:18.230
You get in the bathtub.

00:21:18.230 --> 00:21:20.000
They scrub you down.

00:21:20.000 --> 00:21:22.920
And then they put you in
bed, give you a massage,

00:21:22.920 --> 00:21:24.830
read you a story,
and sing you a song.

00:21:24.830 --> 00:21:27.480
And you fall off to sleep.

00:21:27.480 --> 00:21:30.400
Now, if you kept
the same child mind

00:21:30.400 --> 00:21:32.512
that was soaking that in
that the majority of kids

00:21:32.512 --> 00:21:33.970
actually get--
maybe not everyone--

00:21:33.970 --> 00:21:38.480
but who in their sane
mind would leave that?

00:21:38.480 --> 00:21:39.132
Right?

00:21:39.132 --> 00:21:41.590
Now, I know a lot of adults
who are trying to get that back

00:21:41.590 --> 00:21:45.190
from their partners, which
is probably a good idea.

00:21:45.190 --> 00:21:47.390
But as an adolescent,
if you think about it,

00:21:47.390 --> 00:21:50.600
nature's got to do something
to the brain to say,

00:21:50.600 --> 00:21:53.050
I know that's a pretty
good setup you got.

00:21:53.050 --> 00:21:57.460
But I need you to go
from the familiar home,

00:21:57.460 --> 00:22:03.080
where you're comfortable
and where you're safe,

00:22:03.080 --> 00:22:06.280
to try something that's
unfamiliar, that's

00:22:06.280 --> 00:22:09.340
uncomfortable, that's
uncertain instead of certain,

00:22:09.340 --> 00:22:11.930
and that's potentially unsafe.

00:22:11.930 --> 00:22:14.190
So what are you
going to do if you're

00:22:14.190 --> 00:22:18.375
nature to make sure that this
kid when he's 55 years old

00:22:18.375 --> 00:22:19.500
isn't still living at home?

00:22:22.052 --> 00:22:23.760
You've got to do
something to this brain.

00:22:23.760 --> 00:22:25.490
That's what we're going
to look into the details.

00:22:25.490 --> 00:22:27.830
So part of it is you make
the emotions revved up.

00:22:27.830 --> 00:22:32.130
Because emotion in many
ways is evoking motion.

00:22:32.130 --> 00:22:35.110
It gets the being with the
emotion to do something.

00:22:35.110 --> 00:22:38.310
That's what really emotion
is all about, evoking motion.

00:22:38.310 --> 00:22:40.980
So we know that's going on.

00:22:40.980 --> 00:22:43.230
The limbic area
attachment is changing,

00:22:43.230 --> 00:22:46.060
so it says, hey, I'm not going
to turn to my parents anymore.

00:22:46.060 --> 00:22:48.760
I'll use them as an ATM
machine and a driver.

00:22:48.760 --> 00:22:51.750
But they're not going to
be my source of support.

00:22:51.750 --> 00:22:53.500
They're not going to
be my homies anymore.

00:22:53.500 --> 00:22:55.630
I'm going to find some
other people with whom

00:22:55.630 --> 00:22:58.660
I turn to when I need support,
because they're getting ready.

00:22:58.660 --> 00:23:00.949
So this is very, very important.

00:23:00.949 --> 00:23:02.740
Now, if you bend your
fingers over the top,

00:23:02.740 --> 00:23:04.610
this is the cortex.

00:23:04.610 --> 00:23:07.680
This is the outer
bark of the brain.

00:23:07.680 --> 00:23:08.760
That's what cortex mean.

00:23:08.760 --> 00:23:10.900
It's sometimes called
the neo-mammalian cortex.

00:23:10.900 --> 00:23:13.150
So the limbic area is
the old mammalian brain,

00:23:13.150 --> 00:23:14.410
200 million years old.

00:23:14.410 --> 00:23:16.680
The cortex is the
new mammalian brain.

00:23:16.680 --> 00:23:19.960
The frontal area would be from
your last knuckles forward,

00:23:19.960 --> 00:23:21.940
is the largest in primates.

00:23:21.940 --> 00:23:24.540
And the front of the front
area is the most elaborated

00:23:24.540 --> 00:23:25.380
in human beings.

00:23:25.380 --> 00:23:26.827
It's called the
prefrontal cortex.

00:23:26.827 --> 00:23:28.410
It's what you hear
about all the time.

00:23:28.410 --> 00:23:30.270
It's why we have such
big foreheads compared

00:23:30.270 --> 00:23:32.290
to our ape cousins.

00:23:32.290 --> 00:23:35.319
We have this very elaborated
prefrontal cortex.

00:23:35.319 --> 00:23:36.860
So the frontal area
in general allows

00:23:36.860 --> 00:23:39.910
you to think, conceive
of things, program,

00:23:39.910 --> 00:23:42.430
think about history, think
about coming here to a meeting,

00:23:42.430 --> 00:23:44.054
and bringing lunch,
and making sure you

00:23:44.054 --> 00:23:46.270
get to the next appointment
on time, all this stuff.

00:23:46.270 --> 00:23:48.040
So the frontal area
is really important.

00:23:48.040 --> 00:23:51.190
And this is the area
that matures last.

00:23:51.190 --> 00:23:53.320
So what happens in
this adolescent brain

00:23:53.320 --> 00:23:55.600
is basically this.

00:23:55.600 --> 00:23:58.495
In utero, the brain
stem is well developed.

00:23:58.495 --> 00:24:00.120
The limbic area is
partially developed.

00:24:00.120 --> 00:24:03.670
The cortex is based
undeveloped at birth.

00:24:03.670 --> 00:24:06.140
What this means is that
once the baby is out,

00:24:06.140 --> 00:24:09.380
interactions with the
world in addition to genes

00:24:09.380 --> 00:24:12.320
will influence the way
neurons connect to each other.

00:24:12.320 --> 00:24:17.480
So neurons firing leads
to neurons rewiring.

00:24:17.480 --> 00:24:20.530
And Eric Kandel won the
Nobel Prize for this in 2000

00:24:20.530 --> 00:24:23.110
showing that when you
get neurons to fire off,

00:24:23.110 --> 00:24:25.700
they actually activate
genes in a way that

00:24:25.700 --> 00:24:28.710
gets them to increase their
connections to each other,

00:24:28.710 --> 00:24:31.360
increase even
their myelin, which

00:24:31.360 --> 00:24:35.512
is like a sheath that increases
the speed of interconnection

00:24:35.512 --> 00:24:37.970
among the neurons the way they
communicate with each other.

00:24:37.970 --> 00:24:42.320
100 times faster
and 30 times shorter

00:24:42.320 --> 00:24:45.130
refractory period, resting
period between firings.

00:24:45.130 --> 00:24:47.740
So 100 times 30 is 3,000.

00:24:47.740 --> 00:24:50.560
When you've myelinated
neurons, you basically

00:24:50.560 --> 00:24:53.840
are allowing them to be
coordinated and efficiently

00:24:53.840 --> 00:24:56.410
communicating with each
other 3,000 times more.

00:24:56.410 --> 00:24:58.330
So when you watch
people do the Olympics,

00:24:58.330 --> 00:25:00.730
those Olympic athletes have
been practicing something

00:25:00.730 --> 00:25:04.080
for so many hours,
they've laid down myelin.

00:25:04.080 --> 00:25:08.460
Because skill building is
based on myelin growth.

00:25:08.460 --> 00:25:11.090
So here's what
happens in childhood.

00:25:11.090 --> 00:25:14.190
For the first dozen years,
more or less, this brain

00:25:14.190 --> 00:25:15.500
is like a sponge.

00:25:15.500 --> 00:25:17.292
It just soaks in
adult knowledge,

00:25:17.292 --> 00:25:18.750
soaking in, soaking
in, soaking in.

00:25:21.900 --> 00:25:24.970
But then nature does
something really interesting.

00:25:24.970 --> 00:25:26.795
Instead of just having
the neurons build

00:25:26.795 --> 00:25:30.330
their synaptic connections with
each other pretty progressively

00:25:30.330 --> 00:25:33.245
throughout childhood,
once the switch happens--

00:25:33.245 --> 00:25:36.370
and this is only something we've
known for the last 15 years.

00:25:36.370 --> 00:25:38.510
The studies at my
university, UCLA,

00:25:38.510 --> 00:25:40.690
and also National
Institute of Mental Health,

00:25:40.690 --> 00:25:43.710
we've studied kids across
the developmental period

00:25:43.710 --> 00:25:48.270
and have found the
following shocking findings.

00:25:48.270 --> 00:25:51.320
The remodeling that no one
expected to be happening-- we

00:25:51.320 --> 00:25:54.200
just thought the brain would
continue to grow new stuff,

00:25:54.200 --> 00:25:56.920
and people thought it
was raging hormones

00:25:56.920 --> 00:25:58.640
that would drive an
adolescent mad, which

00:25:58.640 --> 00:26:01.600
is a second myth we're
going to bust right now.

00:26:01.600 --> 00:26:04.660
The changes in adolescence are
not due to raging hormones.

00:26:04.660 --> 00:26:06.420
Puberty happens,
and hormones rise.

00:26:06.420 --> 00:26:09.550
But I don't even know what
a raging hormone would be.

00:26:09.550 --> 00:26:11.540
Hey, I' a hormone,
and I'm really mad.

00:26:11.540 --> 00:26:13.410
What does it mean to
be raging hormones?

00:26:13.410 --> 00:26:16.520
It's not from raging hormones,
but everyone believes that.

00:26:16.520 --> 00:26:18.299
And of course, if it
is raging hormones,

00:26:18.299 --> 00:26:20.340
there's absolutely nothing
you as a parent or you

00:26:20.340 --> 00:26:21.840
as an adolescent
can do about it.

00:26:21.840 --> 00:26:23.450
I'm walking around
in this body, and I

00:26:23.450 --> 00:26:25.575
got these hormones that
are raising out of control,

00:26:25.575 --> 00:26:27.590
so of course I don't
know what I'm doing.

00:26:27.590 --> 00:26:29.380
I've got raging hormones.

00:26:29.380 --> 00:26:33.090
But if it's the brain, no matter
how that brain is changing,

00:26:33.090 --> 00:26:36.160
we now know what you do
with your mind can change

00:26:36.160 --> 00:26:39.480
the function and even the
structure of your brain.

00:26:39.480 --> 00:26:41.540
So the empowerment that
we're about to talk about

00:26:41.540 --> 00:26:44.370
is profound.

00:26:44.370 --> 00:26:47.640
It clarifies what the
myths are, but the truths

00:26:47.640 --> 00:26:49.810
turn out to be liberating.

00:26:49.810 --> 00:26:53.340
So the first thing that was
found which shocked everyone

00:26:53.340 --> 00:26:55.490
was that the brain,
instead of to continue

00:26:55.490 --> 00:26:58.280
to develop synaptic
connections, actually

00:26:58.280 --> 00:27:00.140
starts destroying them.

00:27:00.140 --> 00:27:02.380
It's called pruning.

00:27:02.380 --> 00:27:04.040
The brain starts to
eliminate not only

00:27:04.040 --> 00:27:06.990
the synaptic connections that
were laid down, some of them,

00:27:06.990 --> 00:27:09.490
but it actually starts
destroying neurons themselves.

00:27:09.490 --> 00:27:12.300
You get less synaptic
connections, the connections

00:27:12.300 --> 00:27:15.931
among neurons, and
even less neurons.

00:27:15.931 --> 00:27:18.330
And everyone was going,
wow, what's going on?

00:27:18.330 --> 00:27:21.470
And then as the adolescent
years progressed,

00:27:21.470 --> 00:27:23.074
a second part of
remodeling happened.

00:27:23.074 --> 00:27:25.240
Because the first is you're
getting rid of basically

00:27:25.240 --> 00:27:27.230
connections you don't need.

00:27:27.230 --> 00:27:28.980
The second thing that's
part of remodeling

00:27:28.980 --> 00:27:31.180
besides the first
part, pruning, is

00:27:31.180 --> 00:27:34.890
that you start to lay
down myelin in a big way.

00:27:34.890 --> 00:27:37.020
So the adolescent brain
is going to become

00:27:37.020 --> 00:27:40.600
more specialized by getting
rid of circuits it doesn't need

00:27:40.600 --> 00:27:44.080
and then more efficient in its
coordination and balance-- more

00:27:44.080 --> 00:27:47.040
integrated, if you will--
by taking the remaining

00:27:47.040 --> 00:27:50.610
connections and allowing
them to be 3,000 times better

00:27:50.610 --> 00:27:52.770
at communicating
with each other.

00:27:52.770 --> 00:27:55.027
So the second dozen
years of life, of course

00:27:55.027 --> 00:27:56.610
you continue to learn
with laying down

00:27:56.610 --> 00:27:57.970
new synaptic connections.

00:27:57.970 --> 00:28:00.780
But you're going from being
a generalist of a child

00:28:00.780 --> 00:28:04.604
to a specialist
of an adolescent.

00:28:04.604 --> 00:28:06.270
Now, what this means
for an adolescent--

00:28:06.270 --> 00:28:08.640
and I wrote the "Brainstorm"
book for both adolescents

00:28:08.640 --> 00:28:11.110
and adults to read-- for
the adolescent reading it,

00:28:11.110 --> 00:28:13.030
I say to them
directly, because there

00:28:13.030 --> 00:28:15.700
is no book, for anybody
there's no book written

00:28:15.700 --> 00:28:18.370
about these brain changes
for the general public.

00:28:18.370 --> 00:28:19.670
There's nothing.

00:28:19.670 --> 00:28:22.330
And I wanted something to be
available for my own kids,

00:28:22.330 --> 00:28:24.410
or their friends, or
people I work with.

00:28:24.410 --> 00:28:25.930
I'm an adolescent psychiatrist.

00:28:25.930 --> 00:28:28.300
So an adolescent
themselves could read this

00:28:28.300 --> 00:28:30.592
and know from the inside
out what's going on.

00:28:30.592 --> 00:28:32.300
When you go around to
high schools, which

00:28:32.300 --> 00:28:34.339
I'm doing a lot
lately, I say, what

00:28:34.339 --> 00:28:35.880
have you been taught
about the brain?

00:28:35.880 --> 00:28:38.000
And this is what the
kids say, whether it's

00:28:38.000 --> 00:28:40.664
7th grade or 12th
grade, nothing.

00:28:40.664 --> 00:28:42.580
They've been taught
nothing about their brain.

00:28:42.580 --> 00:28:44.150
I mean, there are exceptions
in charter schools now,

00:28:44.150 --> 00:28:46.450
but for the most part, people
are not taught anything

00:28:46.450 --> 00:28:50.730
about their brain, which is
amazing because we know a lot.

00:28:50.730 --> 00:28:52.510
And when you know
about the brain,

00:28:52.510 --> 00:28:55.320
you can do something about
its function and structure,

00:28:55.320 --> 00:28:58.570
even if you have
genetic risks going on,

00:28:58.570 --> 00:29:00.160
as we're studying at UCLA.

00:29:00.160 --> 00:29:03.020
So here's the deal.

00:29:03.020 --> 00:29:04.620
Remodeling in the
adolescent brain

00:29:04.620 --> 00:29:09.360
takes place starting around 12,
and it goes on to the mid-20s.

00:29:09.360 --> 00:29:13.490
This is why I say adolescence
doesn't end when the 19 year

00:29:13.490 --> 00:29:17.090
birthday follows the
year and you turn 20.

00:29:17.090 --> 00:29:18.020
It doesn't end.

00:29:18.020 --> 00:29:20.450
It's the mid-20s.

00:29:20.450 --> 00:29:22.380
So this adolescent
period of remodeling

00:29:22.380 --> 00:29:24.660
is happening all
through the mid-20s.

00:29:24.660 --> 00:29:26.410
Now, that's really
interesting, because it

00:29:26.410 --> 00:29:28.790
means that they're going
to be continuing changes.

00:29:28.790 --> 00:29:31.180
So let's review some
of these basic myths.

00:29:31.180 --> 00:29:34.650
We said number one, adolescence
is more than the teenage years.

00:29:34.650 --> 00:29:39.030
Number two, we said
that this period of time

00:29:39.030 --> 00:29:41.510
is a time when the
brain is changing,

00:29:41.510 --> 00:29:43.400
and it's not raging
hormones that

00:29:43.400 --> 00:29:45.550
lead to the significant
changes of adolescence.

00:29:45.550 --> 00:29:47.650
It's actually brain remodeling.

00:29:47.650 --> 00:29:50.550
A third myth that
you may have heard,

00:29:50.550 --> 00:29:52.740
which is what was said
in the introduction,

00:29:52.740 --> 00:29:56.520
is many adults and
therefore the adolescents

00:29:56.520 --> 00:29:59.260
who are hearing the
adults say this approach

00:29:59.260 --> 00:30:03.790
adolescence with unbelievable
trepidation instead

00:30:03.790 --> 00:30:05.250
of celebration.

00:30:05.250 --> 00:30:07.747
And this trepidation
is that, oh my god,

00:30:07.747 --> 00:30:09.580
it's going to be a
horrible period I've just

00:30:09.580 --> 00:30:10.830
got to get through.

00:30:10.830 --> 00:30:12.620
And what I want to
urge you to consider

00:30:12.620 --> 00:30:15.590
is that in fact, what
I'm about to outline

00:30:15.590 --> 00:30:18.290
suggests just the opposite.

00:30:18.290 --> 00:30:20.860
It's a period you
can cultivate well

00:30:20.860 --> 00:30:22.890
if you understand what's
happening in the brain.

00:30:22.890 --> 00:30:25.139
And when you understand
what's happening in the brain,

00:30:25.139 --> 00:30:27.230
you can actually
build these circuits

00:30:27.230 --> 00:30:31.680
and make them stronger
intentionally.

00:30:31.680 --> 00:30:33.460
So it's not a period
to just get through.

00:30:33.460 --> 00:30:36.030
It's actually period to
celebrate and cultivate.

00:30:36.030 --> 00:30:37.800
So that's a third myth.

00:30:37.800 --> 00:30:40.680
A fourth myth is that
the adolescent period

00:30:40.680 --> 00:30:42.770
is a period of
risk, which is true.

00:30:42.770 --> 00:30:45.970
That's not a myth, but
only because adolescents

00:30:45.970 --> 00:30:47.807
are impulsive.

00:30:47.807 --> 00:30:49.640
And I want to describe
one thing that nature

00:30:49.640 --> 00:30:51.390
does beyond impulsivity.

00:30:51.390 --> 00:30:54.290
So early teenage
years, it's true.

00:30:54.290 --> 00:30:57.620
Adolescents do not have a
space between an impulse

00:30:57.620 --> 00:31:01.040
and an action as much
as they will later on.

00:31:01.040 --> 00:31:03.840
But here's the story that is
kind of shocking as a parent.

00:31:03.840 --> 00:31:05.790
And for those you who
have younger kids,

00:31:05.790 --> 00:31:08.500
I don't want to scare you,
but this is just the truth.

00:31:08.500 --> 00:31:12.040
Adolescents are three times
more likely during the period

00:31:12.040 --> 00:31:19.430
12 to 24 to be seriously injured
or die from preventable causes.

00:31:19.430 --> 00:31:23.590
Even though their body is much
stronger than any other time,

00:31:23.590 --> 00:31:25.290
not only stronger
in muscle strength,

00:31:25.290 --> 00:31:27.230
but if you get an
infection, it's

00:31:27.230 --> 00:31:28.670
better to be an adolescent.

00:31:28.670 --> 00:31:30.820
You can fight it better
than a kid can, a child,

00:31:30.820 --> 00:31:32.827
or better than an adult can.

00:31:32.827 --> 00:31:34.660
So they have stronger
bodies but three times

00:31:34.660 --> 00:31:37.232
more likely to get
seriously hurt or die.

00:31:37.232 --> 00:31:37.940
Now, why is that?

00:31:37.940 --> 00:31:39.050
Part of it is impulsivity.

00:31:39.050 --> 00:31:40.230
That part is true.

00:31:40.230 --> 00:31:42.150
But it turns out there's
something else that

00:31:42.150 --> 00:31:45.125
has been discovered that
blew everybody away too.

00:31:45.125 --> 00:31:46.500
And it has a weird
name, but it's

00:31:46.500 --> 00:31:49.590
called hyper-rational thinking.

00:31:49.590 --> 00:31:51.160
And if you think
about it this way,

00:31:51.160 --> 00:31:54.130
hyper-rational thinking is
driven by two processes.

00:31:54.130 --> 00:31:55.570
One is a limbic process.

00:31:55.570 --> 00:31:57.660
We talked about the
limbic area having

00:31:57.660 --> 00:32:01.300
an evaluative system that works.

00:32:01.300 --> 00:32:03.930
And the evaluation of the
limbic area during adolescence

00:32:03.930 --> 00:32:06.560
is very different from adulthood
and different from childhood.

00:32:06.560 --> 00:32:10.730
And basically nature
did this, said, OK,

00:32:10.730 --> 00:32:14.420
let's say I'm an adolescent
who's 19 years old.

00:32:14.420 --> 00:32:17.216
And my parents-- and sadly
this is a true story,

00:32:17.216 --> 00:32:19.840
but I'm going to get inside the
head of the kid, which we don't

00:32:19.840 --> 00:32:24.240
know-- my parents give me a
car that's really fun to drive.

00:32:24.240 --> 00:32:27.290
And I think driving this
car 100 miles an hour

00:32:27.290 --> 00:32:33.110
down Wilshire Boulevard is
going to be really cool.

00:32:33.110 --> 00:32:35.930
Now, for me to take
the risk of doing

00:32:35.930 --> 00:32:38.710
that, which on the one
hand, you could say, well,

00:32:38.710 --> 00:32:41.320
if you're trying to get
this kid ready to experience

00:32:41.320 --> 00:32:44.330
the unfamiliar, the
uncomfortable, the uncertain,

00:32:44.330 --> 00:32:47.430
and the dangerous,
to leave home,

00:32:47.430 --> 00:32:49.290
you got to do
something to the brain

00:32:49.290 --> 00:32:51.660
to get me to do
dangerous things, which

00:32:51.660 --> 00:32:53.590
is basically true.

00:32:53.590 --> 00:32:56.090
If I don't take risks I'm
never going to leave home.

00:32:56.090 --> 00:32:57.320
So I got to take risks.

00:32:57.320 --> 00:32:59.690
So it takes this evaluative
circuit and says,

00:32:59.690 --> 00:33:01.520
what's the upside of doing that?

00:33:01.520 --> 00:33:03.645
Well, the upside is my
friends will think I'm cool,

00:33:03.645 --> 00:33:05.561
which is great because
I want to have friends,

00:33:05.561 --> 00:33:07.360
because having friends
will keep me alive.

00:33:07.360 --> 00:33:08.280
So that's good.

00:33:08.280 --> 00:33:09.732
And it'll be really exciting.

00:33:09.732 --> 00:33:11.690
Because I was playing
these video games driving

00:33:11.690 --> 00:33:12.439
100 miles an hour.

00:33:12.439 --> 00:33:13.550
That was fun.

00:33:13.550 --> 00:33:15.830
So this car will be
just like an elaboration

00:33:15.830 --> 00:33:18.690
of the video game I was playing.

00:33:18.690 --> 00:33:22.117
And what's the downside of that?

00:33:22.117 --> 00:33:23.200
I could run into somebody.

00:33:23.200 --> 00:33:23.991
I could get killed.

00:33:23.991 --> 00:33:25.094
I could kill somebody.

00:33:25.094 --> 00:33:26.885
So what happened to me
when my son was one,

00:33:26.885 --> 00:33:30.890
so a long time ago now,
is my favorite professor

00:33:30.890 --> 00:33:33.770
was pulling out of
his house, and he

00:33:33.770 --> 00:33:36.480
was run over by a
19-year-old driving

00:33:36.480 --> 00:33:40.022
95 miles an hour on a surface
street not far from here.

00:33:40.022 --> 00:33:42.160
And he was just
killed instantly.

00:33:42.160 --> 00:33:44.430
And I felt terrible
obviously for my professor,

00:33:44.430 --> 00:33:46.130
for his family, for
the whole field.

00:33:46.130 --> 00:33:49.000
He was a major figure
in our discipline.

00:33:49.000 --> 00:33:52.820
But for the kid,
he's not a bad kid.

00:33:52.820 --> 00:33:54.950
He had what was called
hyper-rational thinking.

00:33:54.950 --> 00:33:57.330
He got the idea of
driving 100 miles an hour.

00:33:57.330 --> 00:33:58.380
He actually planned it.

00:33:58.380 --> 00:34:00.590
This wasn't impulsive.

00:34:00.590 --> 00:34:01.970
And he knew about the dangers.

00:34:01.970 --> 00:34:03.874
This is the thing, another myth.

00:34:03.874 --> 00:34:05.790
Adults say, well,
adolescents just don't know.

00:34:05.790 --> 00:34:07.480
Let's just inform
them of the dangers.

00:34:07.480 --> 00:34:09.750
But actually they
know about dangers.

00:34:09.750 --> 00:34:12.530
Their limbic area just skews
the balance that says, yeah,

00:34:12.530 --> 00:34:13.280
I know about that.

00:34:13.280 --> 00:34:14.750
But this would be so much fun.

00:34:14.750 --> 00:34:18.084
They just don't care
about the danger.

00:34:18.084 --> 00:34:19.750
So what I suggest in
the book, and there

00:34:19.750 --> 00:34:22.759
are exercises called mindsight
exercises teaching about seeing

00:34:22.759 --> 00:34:25.100
your own mind clearly
or other people's mind,

00:34:25.100 --> 00:34:28.420
is if that kid had had
an internal compass that

00:34:28.420 --> 00:34:31.420
wasn't driven by his
limbic area and cortical

00:34:31.420 --> 00:34:34.185
processing of
information but instead--

00:34:34.185 --> 00:34:36.310
and this is now we're just
beginning to learn about

00:34:36.310 --> 00:34:40.260
this-- literally there
are Parallel Distributed

00:34:40.260 --> 00:34:44.380
Processors-- PDP processors--
around the intestine

00:34:44.380 --> 00:34:45.899
and around the heart.

00:34:45.899 --> 00:34:48.360
The intrinsic nervous
system of the heart

00:34:48.360 --> 00:34:51.239
and the nervous system
around the intestines

00:34:51.239 --> 00:34:52.389
are PDP processors.

00:34:52.389 --> 00:34:53.969
You know about PDP right?

00:34:53.969 --> 00:34:56.260
So PDP can process information.

00:34:56.260 --> 00:34:59.500
It doesn't do it with
logical reasoning.

00:34:59.500 --> 00:35:01.470
It's not a logical formula.

00:35:01.470 --> 00:35:04.600
But it has a deep
source of wisdom.

00:35:04.600 --> 00:35:07.710
And what initial
findings suggest

00:35:07.710 --> 00:35:10.381
is that kids who are in
touch with literally what

00:35:10.381 --> 00:35:12.755
their gut is telling them and
what their heart is telling

00:35:12.755 --> 00:35:16.680
them would choose not to
drive a car that fast.

00:35:16.680 --> 00:35:18.220
Even though their
cortex would say,

00:35:18.220 --> 00:35:19.719
yeah, that sounds
like a great idea.

00:35:19.719 --> 00:35:20.810
What's wrong with it?

00:35:20.810 --> 00:35:22.990
And their limbic area skew would
say, yeah, that sounds cool.

00:35:22.990 --> 00:35:24.330
100 miles an hour,
you can do it.

00:35:24.330 --> 00:35:25.120
You did it in the video game.

00:35:25.120 --> 00:35:25.800
Why can't you do it in a car?

00:35:25.800 --> 00:35:26.924
It's the same thing really.

00:35:26.924 --> 00:35:29.290
Steering wheel, gas
pedal, what's the problem?

00:35:29.290 --> 00:35:30.720
Your gut would
tell you something

00:35:30.720 --> 00:35:33.410
doesn't feel right about this.

00:35:33.410 --> 00:35:35.170
And I am choosing not to do it.

00:35:35.170 --> 00:35:38.286
Because adolescents have
a natural, as you can see,

00:35:38.286 --> 00:35:41.310
push against the
status quo of adults.

00:35:41.310 --> 00:35:43.880
So if an adult policeman
says, the law is

00:35:43.880 --> 00:35:47.044
you have to go 35 miles
an hour down Wilshire,

00:35:47.044 --> 00:35:49.252
or to your parent says, hey,
you could have this car,

00:35:49.252 --> 00:35:50.790
but don't drive fast.

00:35:50.790 --> 00:35:53.370
There's a part of an
adolescent brain which

00:35:53.370 --> 00:35:56.380
is literally programmed from
millions of years of evolution

00:35:56.380 --> 00:35:59.310
to say, I don't care about that.

00:35:59.310 --> 00:36:03.100
I know about what they said,
but I don't care about it.

00:36:03.100 --> 00:36:05.950
Even to the point where you
probably know this study,

00:36:05.950 --> 00:36:09.880
but let's say kids who are
going to pick up smoking.

00:36:09.880 --> 00:36:12.200
They learn to smoke
usually during adolescence.

00:36:12.200 --> 00:36:14.765
So they figured out, how can we
get adolescents not to smoke?

00:36:14.765 --> 00:36:15.640
And what did they do?

00:36:15.640 --> 00:36:17.530
They showed them
pictures of graveyards

00:36:17.530 --> 00:36:19.425
to scare them and say,
look, if you smoke,

00:36:19.425 --> 00:36:22.190
this is what your lung
is going to look like.

00:36:22.190 --> 00:36:24.625
It's going to have big
holes in it, cancer, black,

00:36:24.625 --> 00:36:26.610
all this stuff.

00:36:26.610 --> 00:36:28.390
No drop in smoking.

00:36:28.390 --> 00:36:29.820
They said, look, it's not good.

00:36:29.820 --> 00:36:33.340
It's not even so cool to
smoke, no drop in smoking.

00:36:33.340 --> 00:36:36.600
So what would you do if you're
a creative advertisement person

00:36:36.600 --> 00:36:40.756
to try to make adolescents
not pick up smoking

00:36:40.756 --> 00:36:43.382
or if they picked it up stop it?

00:36:43.382 --> 00:36:45.840
You could have the parents
smoke and they'd say I wouldn't.

00:36:45.840 --> 00:36:46.860
It's like that.

00:36:46.860 --> 00:36:48.210
It's just like that, exactly.

00:36:48.210 --> 00:36:49.543
So they did something like that.

00:36:49.543 --> 00:36:51.866
They said, hey,
hey, did you know

00:36:51.866 --> 00:36:57.480
that those really rich adults
who own the cigarette companies

00:36:57.480 --> 00:36:59.530
know it's going to get
your body addicted,

00:36:59.530 --> 00:37:02.540
and they're stealing your
money and laughing all the way

00:37:02.540 --> 00:37:04.810
to the bank because
they want to get

00:37:04.810 --> 00:37:07.070
you to be addicted to this crap?

00:37:07.070 --> 00:37:09.236
And the kids stopped smoking.

00:37:09.236 --> 00:37:11.610
They said, I'm not going to
let the adults do that to me.

00:37:11.610 --> 00:37:13.564
It was brilliant,
absolutely brilliant.

00:37:13.564 --> 00:37:15.230
Because they understood
the whole thing.

00:37:15.230 --> 00:37:16.930
Now, speaking of
addiction we've talked

00:37:16.930 --> 00:37:21.700
about hyper-rational functioning
of the cortex and limbic area.

00:37:21.700 --> 00:37:23.835
The second reason kids
are doing risky behavior

00:37:23.835 --> 00:37:25.459
is really important
to identify, and it

00:37:25.459 --> 00:37:27.330
relates to addiction
too, is there's

00:37:27.330 --> 00:37:29.732
a circuit that's distributed
up from the brain

00:37:29.732 --> 00:37:31.940
stem, the limbic area of
the cortex called the reward

00:37:31.940 --> 00:37:32.720
circuit.

00:37:32.720 --> 00:37:35.550
You've probably heard about this
because it's in the news a lot.

00:37:35.550 --> 00:37:37.274
It's driven by a
neurotransmitter.

00:37:37.274 --> 00:37:39.190
The chemical allows the
neurons to communicate

00:37:39.190 --> 00:37:40.850
with each other called dopamine.

00:37:40.850 --> 00:37:44.170
And what nature has done
with the reward circuit

00:37:44.170 --> 00:37:46.260
is basically some
studies suggest

00:37:46.260 --> 00:37:49.450
dropped the baseline
levels of dopamine

00:37:49.450 --> 00:37:50.872
and raised the release level.

00:37:50.872 --> 00:37:52.580
And you could say,
why would you do that?

00:37:52.580 --> 00:37:54.700
Well, partly the
reason to do that is

00:37:54.700 --> 00:37:57.795
one of the major things that
gets dopamine to be released,

00:37:57.795 --> 00:37:59.670
which this adolescent
would be more driven to

00:37:59.670 --> 00:38:02.290
because they're kind of bored
because their baseline is low

00:38:02.290 --> 00:38:03.900
and they want to
do something, one

00:38:03.900 --> 00:38:07.000
of the major things that
releases it is novelty.

00:38:07.000 --> 00:38:10.815
Novelty, doing something new
gets the dopamine released.

00:38:10.815 --> 00:38:13.190
So you want to do something
new and create something new,

00:38:13.190 --> 00:38:14.100
always be challenged.

00:38:14.100 --> 00:38:15.890
That's fantastic.

00:38:15.890 --> 00:38:17.720
So that's another
way that nature

00:38:17.720 --> 00:38:21.420
gets a kid who's now an
adolescent to do risky things

00:38:21.420 --> 00:38:24.370
and feel kind of, let's see,
without trying something.

00:38:24.370 --> 00:38:26.630
And when parents realize
this, and the beautiful thing

00:38:26.630 --> 00:38:29.216
about the book is now that it's
out, is when parents read this

00:38:29.216 --> 00:38:30.882
and they have their
adolescents read it,

00:38:30.882 --> 00:38:32.340
people are going
to understand, OK,

00:38:32.340 --> 00:38:34.900
there's a natural drive
to push toward novelty.

00:38:34.900 --> 00:38:36.734
And you can do it in
a constructive way

00:38:36.734 --> 00:38:37.900
or just say, oh, that's bad.

00:38:37.900 --> 00:38:39.483
And then the adolescent
will do things

00:38:39.483 --> 00:38:40.620
that are really dangerous.

00:38:40.620 --> 00:38:44.900
So there's a way of building
in healthy novelty exploration.

00:38:44.900 --> 00:38:49.040
So those are the two ways,
hyper-rational cortical limbic

00:38:49.040 --> 00:38:52.430
functioning and changes in
the dopamine reward circuitry.

00:38:52.430 --> 00:38:56.570
Now, sadly, just to make sure
we talk about some downsides

00:38:56.570 --> 00:39:01.060
here, because the
dopamine system

00:39:01.060 --> 00:39:03.540
is the number one system
involved in anything that you

00:39:03.540 --> 00:39:08.280
can get addicted to, whether
it's video games, or gambling,

00:39:08.280 --> 00:39:15.164
or high sugar content foods, or
cocaine, or heroin, or alcohol,

00:39:15.164 --> 00:39:16.872
every single one of
those things that you

00:39:16.872 --> 00:39:21.020
can get addicted to captures
your dopamine circuit.

00:39:21.020 --> 00:39:25.120
This is why we believe
adolescents are absolutely

00:39:25.120 --> 00:39:27.332
the most vulnerable
to become addicted.

00:39:27.332 --> 00:39:29.290
If you're going to become
addicted to something

00:39:29.290 --> 00:39:32.320
in your life, it's most likely
to happen during this period,

00:39:32.320 --> 00:39:34.460
likely because of
this dopamine change.

00:39:34.460 --> 00:39:37.540
So we want to try to understand
that, not just ignore it,

00:39:37.540 --> 00:39:40.400
and do something
positive to support it.

00:39:40.400 --> 00:39:42.870
So let me summarize
all these brain

00:39:42.870 --> 00:39:46.510
changes in the
following four elements.

00:39:46.510 --> 00:39:48.720
We're going to look at
the upside and downside.

00:39:48.720 --> 00:39:50.970
And then I want you to think
about these four elements

00:39:50.970 --> 00:39:54.437
I'm about to talk about and how
they relate to your life now

00:39:54.437 --> 00:39:56.020
an adult-- because
I'm looking around.

00:39:56.020 --> 00:39:57.311
I think most people are adults.

00:39:57.311 --> 00:39:59.590
There may be a couple of
adolescents in the room--

00:39:59.590 --> 00:40:03.010
but also to remember
your own adolescence.

00:40:03.010 --> 00:40:05.640
OK, so, I'm kind of
an acronym addict.

00:40:05.640 --> 00:40:07.880
So luckily this
forms an acronym.

00:40:07.880 --> 00:40:10.170
And if you had to ask
yourself the question, what

00:40:10.170 --> 00:40:12.160
is the essence of what
Dan said, or what's

00:40:12.160 --> 00:40:13.750
the essence of adolescence?

00:40:13.750 --> 00:40:15.820
It spells the word essence.

00:40:15.820 --> 00:40:17.080
So this is useful.

00:40:17.080 --> 00:40:18.847
So let's review what
we just covered.

00:40:18.847 --> 00:40:20.930
So this is going to be a
review of all this stuff,

00:40:20.930 --> 00:40:24.870
and it's going to look at the
upsides and downsides of each

00:40:24.870 --> 00:40:26.070
of these four things.

00:40:26.070 --> 00:40:29.610
The first is E-S,
Emotional Spark.

00:40:29.610 --> 00:40:33.440
We've said that the subcortical
regions, the body, the brain

00:40:33.440 --> 00:40:35.580
stem, and the
limbic area, nature

00:40:35.580 --> 00:40:38.480
has made more active
in an adolescent.

00:40:38.480 --> 00:40:41.470
And this has the downside
with this more motion

00:40:41.470 --> 00:40:43.810
is that adolescents
can be moody.

00:40:43.810 --> 00:40:44.870
They can be irritable.

00:40:44.870 --> 00:40:46.970
As one adolescent told
me to write in the book,

00:40:46.970 --> 00:40:48.260
sometimes we feel one way.

00:40:48.260 --> 00:40:50.670
Sometimes we feel another
way, and chill out.

00:40:50.670 --> 00:40:53.490
They want the adults to know
not take it so personally.

00:40:53.490 --> 00:40:55.500
These emotions are
big, and they're hard.

00:40:55.500 --> 00:40:58.810
It can be really disorienting to
have so many big emotions going

00:40:58.810 --> 00:40:59.320
on.

00:40:59.320 --> 00:41:02.000
And that's a natural
part of evoking motion

00:41:02.000 --> 00:41:03.320
that nature's created.

00:41:03.320 --> 00:41:05.830
It isn't a problem unless
we make it a problem.

00:41:05.830 --> 00:41:07.870
Now, some kids
can get depressed.

00:41:07.870 --> 00:41:09.920
They can develop all
sorts of disorders.

00:41:09.920 --> 00:41:12.490
In fact, the pruning
process is one reason

00:41:12.490 --> 00:41:15.820
we believe that all of the
major psychiatric disorders

00:41:15.820 --> 00:41:18.180
like schizophrenia, or
depression, or manic depressive

00:41:18.180 --> 00:41:21.570
illness have their
onset in adolescence,

00:41:21.570 --> 00:41:24.910
because the pruning is carving
away vulnerable circuits.

00:41:24.910 --> 00:41:26.640
We didn't understand
that before,

00:41:26.640 --> 00:41:28.850
and now we believe that's
the major mechanism.

00:41:28.850 --> 00:41:32.300
The good news is we can
reverse that in many ways.

00:41:32.300 --> 00:41:34.890
So early intervention
can be really important.

00:41:34.890 --> 00:41:37.010
But anyway, the first
thing is emotional spark.

00:41:37.010 --> 00:41:38.440
What's the upside of that?

00:41:38.440 --> 00:41:41.540
This is a period where
life becomes on fire,

00:41:41.540 --> 00:41:43.430
and you feel passionate
about something.

00:41:43.430 --> 00:41:44.960
You really care about something.

00:41:44.960 --> 00:41:48.830
And this passion fuels
a sense of vitality.

00:41:48.830 --> 00:41:50.830
And the sad thing
is many adolescents

00:41:50.830 --> 00:41:54.170
get crushed by adults'
response at home

00:41:54.170 --> 00:41:57.809
and adults' response in
school and in society.

00:41:57.809 --> 00:41:59.850
And so this is really sad,
because then of course

00:41:59.850 --> 00:42:02.630
you will get
demoralized and feel

00:42:02.630 --> 00:42:04.830
disempowered and
disenfranchised.

00:42:04.830 --> 00:42:08.654
So the opportunity, for
example here in an organization

00:42:08.654 --> 00:42:10.070
like Google, is
to think about how

00:42:10.070 --> 00:42:13.800
to shift the culture of
conversation about adolescents.

00:42:13.800 --> 00:42:16.910
And it's a huge opportunity
to change the way we

00:42:16.910 --> 00:42:19.660
as a culture approach
this period of time.

00:42:19.660 --> 00:42:21.490
So E-S, emotional spark.

00:42:21.490 --> 00:42:26.200
S-E, Social Engagement,
the adolescent, as we said,

00:42:26.200 --> 00:42:27.720
because of these
limbic changes, is

00:42:27.720 --> 00:42:29.839
driven to be more with
peers than their parents.

00:42:29.839 --> 00:42:30.630
And that's healthy.

00:42:30.630 --> 00:42:31.213
That's normal.

00:42:31.213 --> 00:42:32.450
That's fine.

00:42:32.450 --> 00:42:37.540
Adolescents need their peers
to survive out in the world.

00:42:37.540 --> 00:42:39.120
Peer group membership
is important.

00:42:39.120 --> 00:42:40.710
What's the downside?

00:42:40.710 --> 00:42:44.170
If you give up morality
for membership,

00:42:44.170 --> 00:42:48.980
then peer pressure will crush
your internal sense of values.

00:42:48.980 --> 00:42:50.470
So membership is
really important.

00:42:50.470 --> 00:42:51.780
Parents need to realize that.

00:42:51.780 --> 00:42:52.780
So when a kid comes
to you and says,

00:42:52.780 --> 00:42:54.230
I need to go to this party.

00:42:54.230 --> 00:42:56.410
Joe and Sammy are all
going, and I got to go.

00:42:56.410 --> 00:42:57.190
I got to go.

00:42:57.190 --> 00:42:59.970
You need to understand when
your adolescent feels like it's

00:42:59.970 --> 00:43:02.820
a matter of life and death,
that's from millions of years

00:43:02.820 --> 00:43:04.860
of evolution that tells
them if they're not

00:43:04.860 --> 00:43:08.107
a member of a group,
they are likely to die.

00:43:08.107 --> 00:43:09.440
They're not just making that up.

00:43:09.440 --> 00:43:13.480
It's not just west Los Angeles
culture or something like that.

00:43:13.480 --> 00:43:14.791
It's in their genes.

00:43:14.791 --> 00:43:17.290
Now, that doesn't mean you need
to let them go to the party.

00:43:17.290 --> 00:43:18.770
Or if they say, I need to
wear a certain-- well, not

00:43:18.770 --> 00:43:21.070
these shoes, but a certain
kind of shoe or I'm

00:43:21.070 --> 00:43:23.440
not going to fit in, it's
a life and death matter.

00:43:23.440 --> 00:43:24.400
That's how it feels.

00:43:24.400 --> 00:43:29.130
You can accept the feeling even
if you don't purchase the shoe.

00:43:29.130 --> 00:43:32.940
So that's a really big step in
increasing the communication

00:43:32.940 --> 00:43:35.250
across the generational divide.

00:43:35.250 --> 00:43:37.170
Now, the upside of
social engagement

00:43:37.170 --> 00:43:41.170
is that every research
study, every single one

00:43:41.170 --> 00:43:45.930
on your medical health, on
your mental health, on how long

00:43:45.930 --> 00:43:48.820
you live and your happiness,
without exception,

00:43:48.820 --> 00:43:50.960
every single one show
that the number one

00:43:50.960 --> 00:43:54.880
factor is supportive
relationships.

00:43:54.880 --> 00:43:57.305
You begin to learn to
move away from your family

00:43:57.305 --> 00:43:59.470
and develop these social
networks of support

00:43:59.470 --> 00:44:00.360
in adolescence.

00:44:00.360 --> 00:44:02.370
So these are skills
that can last a lifetime

00:44:02.370 --> 00:44:03.990
and be incredibly positive.

00:44:03.990 --> 00:44:05.840
So social engagement is S-E.

00:44:05.840 --> 00:44:06.910
What's N?

00:44:06.910 --> 00:44:09.640
So E-S, emotional spark,
S-E, social engagement,

00:44:09.640 --> 00:44:11.380
N is Novelty.

00:44:11.380 --> 00:44:14.410
Novelty, as we said, the
dopamine system change

00:44:14.410 --> 00:44:15.890
gets you to try new things.

00:44:15.890 --> 00:44:18.790
The downside of it, you
can do risky things,

00:44:18.790 --> 00:44:22.551
and you have unfortunately this
increased risk of getting hurt.

00:44:22.551 --> 00:44:23.050
Right?

00:44:23.050 --> 00:44:24.150
What's the upside?

00:44:24.150 --> 00:44:26.660
The upside is
novelty is exciting.

00:44:26.660 --> 00:44:29.220
It allows you to be
driven to try new things,

00:44:29.220 --> 00:44:31.250
to do new things, to
take risks, to be brave,

00:44:31.250 --> 00:44:33.980
to be courageous, to live with
this kind of sense of gusto.

00:44:33.980 --> 00:44:36.120
And that's great.

00:44:36.120 --> 00:44:39.800
So we have to learn to manage
this novelty-seeking drive.

00:44:39.800 --> 00:44:41.600
And finally C-E, what is it?

00:44:41.600 --> 00:44:44.550
C-E is Creative Explorations.

00:44:44.550 --> 00:44:48.130
The creative exploration
of the adolescent brain

00:44:48.130 --> 00:44:51.850
is to try to push against
the adult status quo.

00:44:51.850 --> 00:44:57.200
And nature has designed this
from a large evolutionary point

00:44:57.200 --> 00:44:59.590
of view for the
following reason.

00:44:59.590 --> 00:45:01.720
Basically as a child,
you're the sponge

00:45:01.720 --> 00:45:04.430
soaking in the adult world.

00:45:04.430 --> 00:45:06.540
As adults, you figure out
what the world is like,

00:45:06.540 --> 00:45:09.310
and you try to find
your niche in it.

00:45:09.310 --> 00:45:09.870
You go home.

00:45:09.870 --> 00:45:10.440
You're tired.

00:45:10.440 --> 00:45:11.314
You want to collapse.

00:45:11.314 --> 00:45:14.360
You watch TV, in a modern times.

00:45:14.360 --> 00:45:19.950
If we did not as a species have
the adolescent period of time,

00:45:19.950 --> 00:45:22.830
we would never be
as adaptive as we

00:45:22.830 --> 00:45:25.150
are to an ever-changing world.

00:45:25.150 --> 00:45:29.290
You need to have a continual
source of individuals,

00:45:29.290 --> 00:45:31.370
children now turned
adolescents, who

00:45:31.370 --> 00:45:35.620
approach the status quo
and say, I don't buy it.

00:45:35.620 --> 00:45:36.350
I don't buy this.

00:45:36.350 --> 00:45:37.700
I'm not going to
settle for this.

00:45:37.700 --> 00:45:39.366
I am going to try to
create a new world.

00:45:39.366 --> 00:45:41.240
I am going to adapt to
the world that's here

00:45:41.240 --> 00:45:42.640
and make my own world.

00:45:42.640 --> 00:45:46.610
So if you think about art,
and if you think about music,

00:45:46.610 --> 00:45:49.220
and if you think about
science, and if you

00:45:49.220 --> 00:45:53.830
think about technology, you know
that all the major innovations

00:45:53.830 --> 00:45:57.430
primarily come from
adolescent minds.

00:45:57.430 --> 00:45:59.062
Now, think about it.

00:45:59.062 --> 00:46:00.270
That's creative explorations.

00:46:00.270 --> 00:46:01.561
Now, what's the downside of it?

00:46:01.561 --> 00:46:04.710
The downside of creative
exploration is as a child,

00:46:04.710 --> 00:46:07.164
you just say, hey, this is
the world I'm being given.

00:46:07.164 --> 00:46:08.830
I'm learning to a
deal with it, learning

00:46:08.830 --> 00:46:10.270
to deal with it,
fine, fine, fine.

00:46:10.270 --> 00:46:13.570
But then when you get to be
an adolescent, you go, hey.

00:46:13.570 --> 00:46:17.890
This world I'm being given,
it's kind of not so good.

00:46:17.890 --> 00:46:19.587
In fact, it sucks.

00:46:19.587 --> 00:46:21.170
In fact, I've got
to try to change it.

00:46:21.170 --> 00:46:23.170
And that's a burden, and
it can be disorienting.

00:46:23.170 --> 00:46:24.250
It can be frightening.

00:46:24.250 --> 00:46:25.820
So we need to
realize, especially

00:46:25.820 --> 00:46:28.309
in these days when so much
information is being shared,

00:46:28.309 --> 00:46:30.600
and as you probably know--
I don't remember the ratios.

00:46:30.600 --> 00:46:35.260
You can tell me-- we get
information now in a week--

00:46:35.260 --> 00:46:37.130
I think it's a
week time, right?--

00:46:37.130 --> 00:46:40.220
that is more information
than 100 years ago,

00:46:40.220 --> 00:46:41.680
people would get in a lifetime.

00:46:41.680 --> 00:46:43.960
I think that's the ratio,
something like that.

00:46:43.960 --> 00:46:45.820
So think about an
adolescent who's

00:46:45.820 --> 00:46:49.950
just emerging from childhood
who was built on the net, right?

00:46:49.950 --> 00:46:52.020
Who's soaking in all the
stuff, and their brain's

00:46:52.020 --> 00:46:53.890
being flooded by
all the changes that

00:46:53.890 --> 00:46:56.850
are going on in Somalia, in the
Ukraine, in the whole world.

00:46:56.850 --> 00:46:59.350
Everything is blowing up, and
people are killing each other.

00:46:59.350 --> 00:47:02.010
I mean, it is overwhelming.

00:47:02.010 --> 00:47:03.915
But 100 years ago, it
was nothing like that.

00:47:03.915 --> 00:47:06.290
We have this longer period of
adolescence now, of course,

00:47:06.290 --> 00:47:08.840
because adolescence used to be
a lot shorter, a couple years.

00:47:08.840 --> 00:47:11.590
Now it's a dozen years or more.

00:47:11.590 --> 00:47:13.500
So we have this long
period of adolescence,

00:47:13.500 --> 00:47:16.590
and what's happening now is
adolescence is being filled

00:47:16.590 --> 00:47:19.030
with this stuff at a
time when they realize

00:47:19.030 --> 00:47:20.989
they are going to be
responsible for this world

00:47:20.989 --> 00:47:22.488
and they don't just
accept it as is.

00:47:22.488 --> 00:47:23.540
So that's the downside.

00:47:23.540 --> 00:47:24.580
What's the upside?

00:47:24.580 --> 00:47:27.670
Creative explorations allows
us to create a new world.

00:47:27.670 --> 00:47:29.720
So what I do when
I speak to schools,

00:47:29.720 --> 00:47:31.500
and I want to have
you consider this,

00:47:31.500 --> 00:47:34.190
is if we change the
cultural conversation

00:47:34.190 --> 00:47:37.930
around adolescence, two
big things can happen.

00:47:37.930 --> 00:47:40.110
Number one for
adolescents themselves,

00:47:40.110 --> 00:47:43.050
if we change the way the
curriculum addresses this--

00:47:43.050 --> 00:47:46.459
and now there's a province up in
Canada, a school district here

00:47:46.459 --> 00:47:48.000
in the United States,
and in a couple

00:47:48.000 --> 00:47:50.395
individual schools
in the US too where

00:47:50.395 --> 00:47:52.520
we're thinking about making
a "Brainstorm" approach

00:47:52.520 --> 00:47:53.894
to middle school
and high school.

00:47:53.894 --> 00:47:56.300
You would say, instead of
doing the same old thing you'd

00:47:56.300 --> 00:47:58.250
do for a younger
child, you would

00:47:58.250 --> 00:48:00.895
say, let's build on the
emotional spark, the passion,

00:48:00.895 --> 00:48:04.130
and have kids approach, let's
say, the world's problems

00:48:04.130 --> 00:48:06.640
of what they feel
really compelled

00:48:06.640 --> 00:48:08.480
to really try to improve.

00:48:08.480 --> 00:48:12.540
Famine, violence,
climate change, then I

00:48:12.540 --> 00:48:15.170
say, OK, then what would you
do with social engagement?

00:48:15.170 --> 00:48:16.570
That's the emotional
spark piece.

00:48:16.570 --> 00:48:18.236
The social engagement,
instead of having

00:48:18.236 --> 00:48:20.210
to compete with each
other, where you say,

00:48:20.210 --> 00:48:22.320
hey, do the best on
the spelling bee.

00:48:22.320 --> 00:48:23.380
Get the best grades.

00:48:23.380 --> 00:48:26.370
Get the best SAT scores so you
can get in the best college

00:48:26.370 --> 00:48:28.420
so you can get in
the best graveyard.

00:48:28.420 --> 00:48:33.150
That's basically what
we're telling them really.

00:48:33.150 --> 00:48:36.570
But instead, we are a
collaborative species.

00:48:36.570 --> 00:48:39.650
And not much is done
in school to build

00:48:39.650 --> 00:48:43.520
on our collaborative nature
that's inherent to adolescents.

00:48:43.520 --> 00:48:46.770
So what if you say, OK, instead
of competing with each other,

00:48:46.770 --> 00:48:49.180
if you have a competitive
streak that's beautiful,

00:48:49.180 --> 00:48:52.000
let's compete with
the world's problems.

00:48:52.000 --> 00:48:54.560
And let's get together in
groups of collaborative nature

00:48:54.560 --> 00:48:57.920
where we know from studies
collective intelligence rises

00:48:57.920 --> 00:49:00.100
above individual
intelligence every time.

00:49:00.100 --> 00:49:02.370
So let's have you actually
build with each other

00:49:02.370 --> 00:49:07.170
so that when you beat the
competition, everybody wins.

00:49:07.170 --> 00:49:10.220
That's the kind of setup
which would be win-win.

00:49:10.220 --> 00:49:13.410
And I'll bet you that when you
allow the adolescent mind that

00:49:13.410 --> 00:49:16.730
moves towards novelty and has
creative explorations built

00:49:16.730 --> 00:49:18.720
into these millions
of years of evolution,

00:49:18.720 --> 00:49:20.676
I'll bet you you're
going to find solutions

00:49:20.676 --> 00:49:23.050
to some of these world problems
that we adults have never

00:49:23.050 --> 00:49:24.522
been able to solve.

00:49:24.522 --> 00:49:26.730
These are some of the world's
most pressing problems,

00:49:26.730 --> 00:49:30.140
and there's an untapped resource
of incredible creativity

00:49:30.140 --> 00:49:31.540
and courage.

00:49:31.540 --> 00:49:32.860
So that's for the adolescents.

00:49:32.860 --> 00:49:34.950
It's an incredible
opportunity to empower them.

00:49:34.950 --> 00:49:37.879
And in the "Brainstorm" book, I
have these mindsight exercises

00:49:37.879 --> 00:49:40.170
that allow the adolescent or
the adult reading the book

00:49:40.170 --> 00:49:43.430
to actually build the
integrative fibers of the brain

00:49:43.430 --> 00:49:45.090
than are the basis
of well-being,

00:49:45.090 --> 00:49:47.504
emotional intelligence, and
also the basis of innovation

00:49:47.504 --> 00:49:48.920
that they can
actually build them.

00:49:48.920 --> 00:49:50.210
So that's for the adolescent.

00:49:50.210 --> 00:49:52.168
The final thing I want
to say is think about it

00:49:52.168 --> 00:49:53.610
for your own life.

00:49:53.610 --> 00:49:57.750
How many people do
you know as adults

00:49:57.750 --> 00:50:03.230
who made it through adolescence
but they lost their essence?

00:50:03.230 --> 00:50:05.420
They lost their emotional spark.

00:50:05.420 --> 00:50:08.310
They've lost social
support, social engagement.

00:50:08.310 --> 00:50:10.195
They don't do new
things in their life,

00:50:10.195 --> 00:50:12.236
and they aren't creatively
challenging their mind

00:50:12.236 --> 00:50:14.270
with creative exploration.

00:50:14.270 --> 00:50:16.530
And they've lost the essence
of living a vital life.

00:50:16.530 --> 00:50:20.037
When I was writing this
up, I went, oh my gosh,

00:50:20.037 --> 00:50:22.620
because I'm very familiar with
a field called neuroplasticity,

00:50:22.620 --> 00:50:26.380
which is how we as adults
keep our brain continually

00:50:26.380 --> 00:50:28.994
growing strong
throughout the lifespan.

00:50:28.994 --> 00:50:30.410
And in a book
called "Mindsight" I

00:50:30.410 --> 00:50:33.460
show you how you do that even
with someone in their 90s.

00:50:33.460 --> 00:50:34.910
So we know that for sure.

00:50:34.910 --> 00:50:38.000
What you do in your mind
can keep your brain strong.

00:50:38.000 --> 00:50:42.620
If you had to pick the top
four aspects of life that

00:50:42.620 --> 00:50:45.670
will keep your brain
growing strong and even

00:50:45.670 --> 00:50:49.800
being integrated, it
would be emotional spark.

00:50:49.800 --> 00:50:52.250
Keep passion in your
life for what you do.

00:50:52.250 --> 00:50:55.030
Social engagements, keep
your social connections,

00:50:55.030 --> 00:50:57.140
the network of
support really strong.

00:50:57.140 --> 00:51:00.450
Novelty, give your brain
new things it does.

00:51:00.450 --> 00:51:02.340
Try new activities.

00:51:02.340 --> 00:51:04.530
And creative explorations,
challenge your mind

00:51:04.530 --> 00:51:06.600
in ways that are not
just the status quo

00:51:06.600 --> 00:51:09.212
but really keep you
pushing the boundaries.

00:51:09.212 --> 00:51:10.670
Emotional spark,
social engagement,

00:51:10.670 --> 00:51:12.580
novelty, creative
explorations, exactly what

00:51:12.580 --> 00:51:14.600
we need as adults too.

00:51:14.600 --> 00:51:17.500
And then I realized,
wow, maybe some adults

00:51:17.500 --> 00:51:21.130
I've seen over these 25
years of being in practice,

00:51:21.130 --> 00:51:25.340
maybe they're angry
at their adolescents.

00:51:25.340 --> 00:51:28.360
Outside of their awareness
but deep in their hearts,

00:51:28.360 --> 00:51:32.820
they know this adolescent has
an essence that they themselves

00:51:32.820 --> 00:51:34.040
have lost.

00:51:34.040 --> 00:51:35.964
So what I say to the
adult very gingerly who's

00:51:35.964 --> 00:51:38.505
also reading the book so they
won't just toss it in the trash

00:51:38.505 --> 00:51:42.690
can, I say, look,
if this essence

00:51:42.690 --> 00:51:45.670
is something you would like
to get back, if you follow

00:51:45.670 --> 00:51:48.490
these exercises too,
you can get it back too.

00:51:48.490 --> 00:51:51.120
It's never too late to
revive your essence.

00:51:51.120 --> 00:51:54.370
I know for a fact you can
take someone even in their 90s

00:51:54.370 --> 00:51:55.300
and revive it.

00:51:55.300 --> 00:51:57.680
And so when we do this
then, the exciting thing

00:51:57.680 --> 00:51:59.250
is everybody wins.

00:51:59.250 --> 00:52:02.040
You improve the relationship
between adults and adolescents.

00:52:02.040 --> 00:52:04.330
You'll tap into an
incredible resource

00:52:04.330 --> 00:52:06.920
of innovation,
courage, and creativity

00:52:06.920 --> 00:52:08.290
in the adolescent group.

00:52:08.290 --> 00:52:11.480
You'll allow the adult
who's lost their essence

00:52:11.480 --> 00:52:13.970
to get really revived.

00:52:13.970 --> 00:52:15.220
And so everybody wins.

00:52:15.220 --> 00:52:17.690
So the exciting thing
is getting this change

00:52:17.690 --> 00:52:20.900
in the cultural conversation
for adolescents and adults

00:52:20.900 --> 00:52:21.810
out in the world.

00:52:21.810 --> 00:52:24.100
And the great news is
if we do that, there's

00:52:24.100 --> 00:52:26.090
this incredible opportunity
to actually make

00:52:26.090 --> 00:52:29.284
this world a better place
for all of us to live.

00:52:29.284 --> 00:52:30.950
So thank you so much
for your attention,

00:52:30.950 --> 00:52:32.980
and we have time for discussion.

00:52:32.980 --> 00:52:33.641
Thank you.

00:52:37.054 --> 00:52:38.470
AUDIENCE: You
talked about pruning

00:52:38.470 --> 00:52:41.050
and then the myelin
growth stage.

00:52:41.050 --> 00:52:43.734
Do you know when those
two stages tend to occur?

00:52:43.734 --> 00:52:45.900
DANIEL SIEGEL: Yeah, they're
a little different male

00:52:45.900 --> 00:52:46.510
and female.

00:52:46.510 --> 00:52:50.460
So female starts about a year
and a half sooner than males.

00:52:50.460 --> 00:52:52.990
And when you watch the path,
they happen differently.

00:52:52.990 --> 00:52:56.410
But basically, it's the first
few years is a lot of pruning,

00:52:56.410 --> 00:52:58.271
and the pruning
sort of comes down.

00:52:58.271 --> 00:53:00.395
And then the myelination,
which is the white matter

00:53:00.395 --> 00:53:01.954
or the brain, is
increasing later on.

00:53:01.954 --> 00:53:03.370
So if you saw a
graph, it would be

00:53:03.370 --> 00:53:05.170
kind of overlapping like that.

00:53:05.170 --> 00:53:08.690
So the first two, three, four
years, a lot, a lot of pruning.

00:53:08.690 --> 00:53:12.260
And then you see the following
years a lot of myelination.

00:53:12.260 --> 00:53:14.550
And the myelination
goes on into the 20s.

00:53:14.550 --> 00:53:16.850
Now, here's the thing.

00:53:16.850 --> 00:53:19.410
This is sort of a myth, but
it's just a misconception.

00:53:19.410 --> 00:53:22.990
People say, oh, the prefrontal
cortex is just immature.

00:53:22.990 --> 00:53:24.560
That's why adolescents
are immature.

00:53:24.560 --> 00:53:28.040
And I really think we should
stop using the word immature.

00:53:28.040 --> 00:53:30.280
Because immature
applies you are one

00:53:30.280 --> 00:53:31.740
place only because
you're getting

00:53:31.740 --> 00:53:33.390
ready to go somewhere else.

00:53:33.390 --> 00:53:36.056
I think the adolescent period is
a period where you're basically

00:53:36.056 --> 00:53:38.516
growing these integrative
fibers throughout the brain.

00:53:38.516 --> 00:53:40.390
And so the brain is
becoming more integrated.

00:53:40.390 --> 00:53:44.070
And the prefrontal cortex is
like a profound integrative

00:53:44.070 --> 00:53:47.020
area that's just making sure
all the other regions that

00:53:47.020 --> 00:53:47.520
are growing.

00:53:47.520 --> 00:53:49.760
So you really have to
look at specific areas,

00:53:49.760 --> 00:53:51.718
and they're a little
different male and female.

00:53:51.718 --> 00:53:55.150
But if you look at the graph,
you can see it that way.

00:53:55.150 --> 00:53:56.710
And I can refer
you to some papers.

00:53:56.710 --> 00:53:59.000
AUDIENCE: And one
follow-up based

00:53:59.000 --> 00:54:02.000
on that is should you be
doing something different

00:54:02.000 --> 00:54:04.110
as a parent during
those different stages?

00:54:04.110 --> 00:54:07.091
Or do you kind of consider
that all part of adolescence?

00:54:07.091 --> 00:54:09.090
DANIEL SIEGEL: You mean
pruning and myelination?

00:54:09.090 --> 00:54:09.370
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

00:54:09.370 --> 00:54:10.953
DANIEL SIEGEL: Well,
they go together.

00:54:10.953 --> 00:54:12.710
But here's the way I
would think about it.

00:54:12.710 --> 00:54:15.840
I would think that, and what
I would say to the adolescent

00:54:15.840 --> 00:54:18.320
as a parent of an
adolescent is, it's a use it

00:54:18.320 --> 00:54:19.790
or lose it principle.

00:54:19.790 --> 00:54:24.610
So I'd say to a kid who's into
music, if you really like music

00:54:24.610 --> 00:54:28.520
and you're 12, 13 years
old, pruning happens.

00:54:28.520 --> 00:54:30.800
And basically nature
is going to say,

00:54:30.800 --> 00:54:34.960
if you're not using a
certain circuit, dump it.

00:54:34.960 --> 00:54:36.100
You don't need it.

00:54:36.100 --> 00:54:38.690
So this period of adolescence,
I say to my adolescents,

00:54:38.690 --> 00:54:41.691
is, if you really like
music, just exposure yourself

00:54:41.691 --> 00:54:42.440
to a lot of music.

00:54:42.440 --> 00:54:43.273
Play a lot of music.

00:54:43.273 --> 00:54:43.830
Do music.

00:54:43.830 --> 00:54:45.290
That's great.

00:54:45.290 --> 00:54:46.140
Do it.

00:54:46.140 --> 00:54:47.910
Because this is
the time your brain

00:54:47.910 --> 00:54:49.076
is going to be specializing.

00:54:49.076 --> 00:54:50.230
I would let them know that.

00:54:50.230 --> 00:54:53.050
Same thing with athletics,
same thing with anything.

00:54:53.050 --> 00:54:54.730
That's a good time
to do something.

00:54:54.730 --> 00:55:00.002
The myelinating is by practice,
you actually lay down myelin.

00:55:00.002 --> 00:55:01.960
And so I would just say
that and then back off.

00:55:01.960 --> 00:55:03.940
So it isn't like you say,
you should be doing this.

00:55:03.940 --> 00:55:06.140
You should say, this is
information you should have,

00:55:06.140 --> 00:55:07.461
and you make your decision.

00:55:07.461 --> 00:55:09.210
That's a very different
thing than saying,

00:55:09.210 --> 00:55:10.430
let's avoid pruning.

00:55:10.430 --> 00:55:11.596
Let's avoid-- every morning.

00:55:11.596 --> 00:55:13.249
And some adolescents
have told me

00:55:13.249 --> 00:55:15.040
they're a little worried
about the pruning.

00:55:15.040 --> 00:55:17.560
And so you want to say,
you can use your mind

00:55:17.560 --> 00:55:19.740
to keep those circuits going.

00:55:19.740 --> 00:55:22.230
Yeah.

00:55:22.230 --> 00:55:28.230
AUDIENCE: I find it
fascinating about the PDP

00:55:28.230 --> 00:55:31.560
process in your heart or gut.

00:55:31.560 --> 00:55:36.350
In that sense, you mentioned
the example the adolescents are

00:55:36.350 --> 00:55:40.989
actually know from those part
that the danger, the risk.

00:55:40.989 --> 00:55:41.780
DANIEL SIEGEL: Yes.

00:55:41.780 --> 00:55:43.980
AUDIENCE: So what's the
practical implication?

00:55:43.980 --> 00:55:46.605
DANIEL SIEGEL: So the practical
thing is this-- yes, very good.

00:55:46.605 --> 00:55:48.900
So you have your intestines,
and you have your heart.

00:55:48.900 --> 00:55:51.920
And they're going to
process information.

00:55:51.920 --> 00:55:56.910
There is a pathway from these
PDP processors up lamina 1,

00:55:56.910 --> 00:55:59.760
layer one of the spinal cord,
and up the 10th cranial nerve,

00:55:59.760 --> 00:56:00.496
the vagus nerve.

00:56:00.496 --> 00:56:01.620
You don't need to remember.

00:56:01.620 --> 00:56:03.070
If you want to know those
details, they're there.

00:56:03.070 --> 00:56:05.390
But anyway, they're basically
very limited pathways

00:56:05.390 --> 00:56:06.180
that come up.

00:56:06.180 --> 00:56:09.730
They come up into the brain
to a very specific area called

00:56:09.730 --> 00:56:13.320
the anterior insula and
the anterior cingulate.

00:56:13.320 --> 00:56:16.930
For most people, the way
you get the processing

00:56:16.930 --> 00:56:21.320
that goes on there into the
part of the brain, this cortex

00:56:21.320 --> 00:56:25.860
that's going to make ultimate
decisions, go, no go.

00:56:25.860 --> 00:56:26.390
Do I do it?

00:56:26.390 --> 00:56:27.090
Do I not do it?

00:56:27.090 --> 00:56:29.310
Let's say for the
driving, you can

00:56:29.310 --> 00:56:30.780
have the processing going on.

00:56:30.780 --> 00:56:33.750
But the pathway to this
prefrontal decision-making

00:56:33.750 --> 00:56:35.670
circuit is not well developed.

00:56:35.670 --> 00:56:39.300
So even though their gut would
be processing don't do it,

00:56:39.300 --> 00:56:42.050
their cortex would never
receive the signal.

00:56:42.050 --> 00:56:44.540
So in the book,
I teach exercises

00:56:44.540 --> 00:56:49.140
where we know how to
increase the anterior insula

00:56:49.140 --> 00:56:51.626
activity and size.

00:56:51.626 --> 00:56:52.750
And I put them in the book.

00:56:52.750 --> 00:56:55.520
Literally we now know-- this
is the amazing thing-- we now

00:56:55.520 --> 00:56:59.036
know if you do this exercise,
you will stimulate the-- I

00:56:59.036 --> 00:57:01.760
call it SNAG-- Stimulate
Neuronal Activity Growth.

00:57:01.760 --> 00:57:04.120
You're going to SNAG
the anterior insula

00:57:04.120 --> 00:57:06.170
so that when you
stimulate to grow studies

00:57:06.170 --> 00:57:08.170
show it will not only fire.

00:57:08.170 --> 00:57:10.630
You get it to fire.

00:57:10.630 --> 00:57:13.500
Neurons which fire together wire
together is the fun statement.

00:57:13.500 --> 00:57:14.690
And you get it to grow.

00:57:14.690 --> 00:57:17.407
Then that kid-- we
need to do the studies,

00:57:17.407 --> 00:57:18.990
but this is what I
suggest in the book

00:57:18.990 --> 00:57:21.840
because all the research
points in this direction--

00:57:21.840 --> 00:57:24.505
is that the person who has
that kind of mindfulness,

00:57:24.505 --> 00:57:26.630
that kind of reflection,
that kind of interoception

00:57:26.630 --> 00:57:31.300
is what it's called, they will
allow the wisdom of the body

00:57:31.300 --> 00:57:34.255
to influence the cortical
circuits of decision.

00:57:34.255 --> 00:57:35.380
Does that make sense?

00:57:35.380 --> 00:57:36.840
So you're basically
strengthening--

00:57:36.840 --> 00:57:39.298
I don't know if the computer
analogy-- you're strengthening

00:57:39.298 --> 00:57:41.770
the PDP processing
in one region that's

00:57:41.770 --> 00:57:43.800
geographically
separate from another.

00:57:43.800 --> 00:57:45.800
And you're laying
down the cables

00:57:45.800 --> 00:57:49.370
and so that it reaches
the ultimate decision--

00:57:49.370 --> 00:57:51.220
because this doesn't
make decisions.

00:57:51.220 --> 00:57:53.360
This makes decisions what
the body is going to do.

00:57:53.360 --> 00:57:54.720
This doesn't do that.

00:57:54.720 --> 00:57:56.930
So we want to have
this have literally--

00:57:56.930 --> 00:57:59.470
and what I teach the
adolescent reading is I say,

00:57:59.470 --> 00:58:00.970
this is how it works.

00:58:00.970 --> 00:58:04.680
Your cortex is vulnerable
because it's hyper-rational.

00:58:04.680 --> 00:58:08.611
You want to let your own
wisdom, not your parents' rules,

00:58:08.611 --> 00:58:11.110
not the law, because of course
you're pushing against those.

00:58:11.110 --> 00:58:13.540
You want to let your own
wisdom be your guide.

00:58:13.540 --> 00:58:16.150
I call that an internal compass.

00:58:16.150 --> 00:58:18.600
That's how you develop it.

00:58:18.600 --> 00:58:21.140
AUDIENCE: I'm curious what you
were saying about the drastic

00:58:21.140 --> 00:58:21.790
link-

00:58:21.790 --> 00:58:23.140
DANIEL SIEGEL: Come right up
to the mic so we can hear.

00:58:23.140 --> 00:58:25.190
AUDIENCE: Curious about
the drastic lengthening

00:58:25.190 --> 00:58:26.310
of the adolescence period.

00:58:26.310 --> 00:58:27.505
You were saying it used
to be a couple years,

00:58:27.505 --> 00:58:29.220
and now it's like a dozen years.

00:58:29.220 --> 00:58:32.086
I assume that cultural factors
would have a big part of that.

00:58:32.086 --> 00:58:33.710
But adolescence, as
you're defining it,

00:58:33.710 --> 00:58:35.360
is really biological processes.

00:58:35.360 --> 00:58:37.669
So what are the
interactions there?

00:58:37.669 --> 00:58:39.460
DANIEL SIEGEL: Yeah,
it's a great question.

00:58:39.460 --> 00:58:45.090
So let me just lay out
the facts as we know them.

00:58:45.090 --> 00:58:49.040
The external marker that we use
from let's say 150 years ago

00:58:49.040 --> 00:58:52.370
is the onset of puberty.

00:58:52.370 --> 00:58:56.790
So puberty had its onset
around 15 or 16 years of age

00:58:56.790 --> 00:58:59.750
150 years ago across
many cultures.

00:58:59.750 --> 00:59:02.480
And for girls, it was about
a year, year and a half

00:59:02.480 --> 00:59:02.980
before boys.

00:59:02.980 --> 00:59:04.854
So there's a little bit
different male female

00:59:04.854 --> 00:59:05.430
difference.

00:59:05.430 --> 00:59:09.060
And then girls would actually
get married and settled

00:59:09.060 --> 00:59:13.270
down around two years later
in terms of raising a family.

00:59:13.270 --> 00:59:15.670
And boys would be maybe
two or three years later.

00:59:15.670 --> 00:59:18.150
So for a female, the adolescent
period was about two years.

00:59:18.150 --> 00:59:20.440
For males, about 3 1/2, 4 years.

00:59:20.440 --> 00:59:23.870
That was basically
150 years ago.

00:59:23.870 --> 00:59:27.190
What has changed
now is that puberty

00:59:27.190 --> 00:59:31.739
just as a marker, rough marker,
has come from 15 or 16 down.

00:59:31.739 --> 00:59:33.530
And now some girls are
having the beginning

00:59:33.530 --> 00:59:39.060
of their menstrual cycle
around 11, 10, some even 9

00:59:39.060 --> 00:59:40.420
for reasons we don't understand.

00:59:40.420 --> 00:59:42.600
It looks like it's
related to nutrition.

00:59:42.600 --> 00:59:44.880
Boys it's coming down early
about a year and a half

00:59:44.880 --> 00:59:48.450
later in terms of development
of sexual maturation.

00:59:48.450 --> 00:59:50.034
And roughly, it's
not exactly the same

00:59:50.034 --> 00:59:52.324
because you can have someone
delay puberty who actually

00:59:52.324 --> 00:59:54.100
has started adolescence
in the brain.

00:59:54.100 --> 00:59:56.440
This is why we know they're
not exactly the same thing.

00:59:56.440 --> 00:59:59.190
But as a rough estimate,
then this stretch

00:59:59.190 --> 01:00:03.190
then where now you have people
starting the adolescent period

01:00:03.190 --> 01:00:05.840
around 12, more or
less, they're not

01:00:05.840 --> 01:00:07.410
assuming adult responsibilities.

01:00:07.410 --> 01:00:09.660
And also the brain is
remodeling way into the mid-20s.

01:00:09.660 --> 01:00:11.890
So this is definitely
culturally dependent.

01:00:11.890 --> 01:00:14.450
If we could do these same
scans on people from Papua New

01:00:14.450 --> 01:00:18.290
Guinea, maybe they'd
have a two-year period.

01:00:18.290 --> 01:00:19.730
We'd have to look at that.

01:00:19.730 --> 01:00:21.820
There's a center that we've
been running for 10 years called

01:00:21.820 --> 01:00:23.778
the Center for Culture,
Brain, and Development.

01:00:23.778 --> 01:00:26.970
And just to respond to your
really important big question,

01:00:26.970 --> 01:00:31.300
culture shapes the timing
of brain development.

01:00:31.300 --> 01:00:34.540
But the periods
that we go through

01:00:34.540 --> 01:00:36.520
seem to be
biologically built in.

01:00:36.520 --> 01:00:39.340
The question is their
onset and their offset

01:00:39.340 --> 01:00:41.377
may be culturally determined.

01:00:41.377 --> 01:00:43.710
AUDIENCE: So it's almost like
the adult responsibilities

01:00:43.710 --> 01:00:46.120
kind of clamps down on this
process and terminates it.

01:00:46.120 --> 01:00:48.453
DANIEL SIEGEL: Well, that
would be the interesting thing

01:00:48.453 --> 01:00:50.840
to study subcultures where
people do settle down,

01:00:50.840 --> 01:00:51.410
get married.

01:00:51.410 --> 01:00:56.070
And we don't have enough
brain scans to see yet.

01:00:56.070 --> 01:00:58.120
Absolutely, that
may be what happens.

01:00:58.120 --> 01:01:03.740
And of course what we know is
that it's a cyclical thing.

01:01:03.740 --> 01:01:05.780
What I write about,
which gets people

01:01:05.780 --> 01:01:08.680
very interested in
this whole thing,

01:01:08.680 --> 01:01:11.160
is that the mind is not
just about brain activity.

01:01:11.160 --> 01:01:13.510
It's about what happens
in a culture too,

01:01:13.510 --> 01:01:15.570
like what's shaped
by our information

01:01:15.570 --> 01:01:17.680
sharing in the
internet, for example,

01:01:17.680 --> 01:01:19.860
and what's shaped across
media and stuff like that.

01:01:19.860 --> 01:01:22.600
So mental processes
are both cultural.

01:01:22.600 --> 01:01:25.040
That is they're relational,
how we share information.

01:01:25.040 --> 01:01:26.935
And they're embodied.

01:01:26.935 --> 01:01:29.060
They're what's happening
throughout the whole body.

01:01:29.060 --> 01:01:31.351
So when you look at it that
way and the developing mind

01:01:31.351 --> 01:01:34.855
kind of explorers this, then
you realize, half of the story

01:01:34.855 --> 01:01:36.090
is the body.

01:01:36.090 --> 01:01:39.760
The other half is our relational
world of information sharing.

01:01:39.760 --> 01:01:41.510
And so they
influence each other.

01:01:41.510 --> 01:01:43.770
Yes, and we can do
one more question?

01:01:43.770 --> 01:01:45.117
Yeah, great.

01:01:45.117 --> 01:01:46.950
AUDIENCE: There's a
book I read a while back

01:01:46.950 --> 01:01:49.121
called "Hold Onto Your
Kids" by Gabor Mate.

01:01:49.121 --> 01:01:49.912
DANIEL SIEGEL: Yes.

01:01:49.912 --> 01:01:51.160
AUDIENCE: Are you
familiar with it?

01:01:51.160 --> 01:01:52.535
DANIEL SIEGEL: I know
Gabor, yeah, yes, I'm

01:01:52.535 --> 01:01:53.010
familiar with it.

01:01:53.010 --> 01:01:54.760
AUDIENCE: So the basic
premise I took away

01:01:54.760 --> 01:01:58.320
from that was that the
attachment of adolescents

01:01:58.320 --> 01:02:02.580
to peers should not be
encouraged but really

01:02:02.580 --> 01:02:04.210
redirected to the
parents instead,

01:02:04.210 --> 01:02:08.260
whereas you seem to say that
peer attachment is actually

01:02:08.260 --> 01:02:11.760
the norm and actually
desirable for adolescents.

01:02:11.760 --> 01:02:15.080
And how do you feel that
parents should approach this?

01:02:15.080 --> 01:02:17.840
DANIEL SIEGEL: Yes, thank
you for pointing that out.

01:02:17.840 --> 01:02:23.490
So first of all, what happens in
modern culture is-- and there's

01:02:23.490 --> 01:02:25.490
a very important question
you were raising--

01:02:25.490 --> 01:02:30.932
is that adolescents have
a natural push away.

01:02:30.932 --> 01:02:32.640
In all cultures we've
been able to study,

01:02:32.640 --> 01:02:35.306
so in our center, the Center for
Culture, Brain, and Development

01:02:35.306 --> 01:02:37.512
at UCLA, we looked
at all cultures

01:02:37.512 --> 01:02:38.470
that have been studied.

01:02:38.470 --> 01:02:40.390
And every culture has
an adolescent period

01:02:40.390 --> 01:02:42.440
where the adolescents
push against adults.

01:02:42.440 --> 01:02:45.190
Now, it could be in
subtle ways like if you're

01:02:45.190 --> 01:02:49.080
in a society where they're
weaving from the top down,

01:02:49.080 --> 01:02:51.140
well, you're going to
weave from the bottom up.

01:02:51.140 --> 01:02:54.130
That's your so-called
pushing away.

01:02:54.130 --> 01:02:58.000
But in every society we're able
to study, there's a push away.

01:02:58.000 --> 01:03:02.010
Now, in most
societies except ours,

01:03:02.010 --> 01:03:05.540
there are non-parental
adults who

01:03:05.540 --> 01:03:09.170
serve important mentor
relationships guiding

01:03:09.170 --> 01:03:11.430
the development of adolescents.

01:03:11.430 --> 01:03:13.360
That's extremely important.

01:03:13.360 --> 01:03:16.960
But it's not the parent.

01:03:16.960 --> 01:03:19.372
So where I would
disagree the Gabor,

01:03:19.372 --> 01:03:21.580
and we had a talk about this
recently at a meeting up

01:03:21.580 --> 01:03:29.370
in British Columbia, I don't
agree that it's unhealthy,

01:03:29.370 --> 01:03:30.920
as he points out,
for adolescents

01:03:30.920 --> 01:03:32.670
to push away from their parents.

01:03:32.670 --> 01:03:34.100
I don't agree with that at all.

01:03:34.100 --> 01:03:36.150
What I do agree with
is the sentiment

01:03:36.150 --> 01:03:38.790
that adolescents should
be launched into the world

01:03:38.790 --> 01:03:41.210
without any adult
involved with them.

01:03:41.210 --> 01:03:43.242
The challenge we
have in this culture,

01:03:43.242 --> 01:03:45.200
as you've seen from what
happened at Penn State

01:03:45.200 --> 01:03:47.600
and what happens in some
religious organizations,

01:03:47.600 --> 01:03:51.400
is when you get a non-family
member adult, sometimes even

01:03:51.400 --> 01:03:55.320
a family member, involved
that's not a parent involved

01:03:55.320 --> 01:03:58.490
in an adolescent's life,
there's abuse that goes on.

01:03:58.490 --> 01:04:01.090
So understandably,
we as parents are

01:04:01.090 --> 01:04:04.850
very concerned about when
you see an adult starting

01:04:04.850 --> 01:04:08.680
to take on a mentor role with
an adolescent boy or girl.

01:04:08.680 --> 01:04:10.970
So I don't have an
easy answer to this.

01:04:10.970 --> 01:04:14.665
But the general issue is
adolescents need each other.

01:04:14.665 --> 01:04:16.540
They need to have
attachment with each other.

01:04:16.540 --> 01:04:18.770
It's extremely important
for their development.

01:04:18.770 --> 01:04:21.760
And if you look at the work
of Susan Harter, H-A-R-T-E-R,

01:04:21.760 --> 01:04:24.140
I think the research
absolutely bears that out.

01:04:24.140 --> 01:04:26.340
They should be becoming
attached to each other.

01:04:26.340 --> 01:04:29.800
It's a natural part of
millions of years of evolution

01:04:29.800 --> 01:04:31.260
that that's a natural thing.

01:04:31.260 --> 01:04:34.150
Should they push away completely
from adults, their parents

01:04:34.150 --> 01:04:34.750
including?

01:04:34.750 --> 01:04:36.990
Not at all, so that
I agree with Gabor.

01:04:36.990 --> 01:04:39.430
For sure, they shouldn't
push away completely.

01:04:39.430 --> 01:04:42.630
So the balance would
be how we as a society

01:04:42.630 --> 01:04:45.440
can figure out how
do you have some kind

01:04:45.440 --> 01:04:48.440
of institutionalized
mentor program

01:04:48.440 --> 01:04:51.045
where you have
non-parental adults who

01:04:51.045 --> 01:04:53.200
are an active part
of the essence

01:04:53.200 --> 01:04:55.780
of adolescence supporting
and adolescent's growth?

01:04:55.780 --> 01:04:58.010
So I think we need to get
our minds all together

01:04:58.010 --> 01:05:00.390
saying, how are we
going to invent this,

01:05:00.390 --> 01:05:01.840
minimizing the risks.

01:05:01.840 --> 01:05:03.901
Because abuse is a serious risk.

01:05:03.901 --> 01:05:06.150
I mean, just look at what
would happen in these things

01:05:06.150 --> 01:05:07.184
I'm talking about.

01:05:07.184 --> 01:05:08.600
So we need to do
it in a safe way,

01:05:08.600 --> 01:05:10.933
but we absolutely need it,
because our culture basically

01:05:10.933 --> 01:05:11.660
lacks it.

01:05:11.660 --> 01:05:13.700
And in that sense,
it's really true.

01:05:13.700 --> 01:05:17.240
We need to keep adults
involved in adolescents' lives

01:05:17.240 --> 01:05:20.095
but also support them in having
attachments with each other.

01:05:20.095 --> 01:05:21.400
Does that make sense?

01:05:21.400 --> 01:05:22.620
Yeah, good, thank you.

01:05:25.730 --> 01:05:27.130
RON: I have one final question.

01:05:27.130 --> 01:05:28.580
DANIEL SIEGEL: Yes.

01:05:28.580 --> 01:05:33.320
RON: This is Google, and
outliers are kind of the norm

01:05:33.320 --> 01:05:36.670
here, so I would like to ask--

01:05:39.230 --> 01:05:41.990
DANIEL SIEGEL: That's why I
feel so at home at Google.

01:05:41.990 --> 01:05:44.960
RON: This onset at
12 and ending at 24,

01:05:44.960 --> 01:05:46.370
what's the variability on that?

01:05:46.370 --> 01:05:50.400
DANIEL SIEGEL: Yeah, so first
of all, saying it ends at 24

01:05:50.400 --> 01:05:53.370
is an estimate of when
the remodeling generally

01:05:53.370 --> 01:05:56.510
seems to come to some
kind of completion.

01:05:56.510 --> 01:05:58.960
But the brain continues to
change throughout the lifespan.

01:05:58.960 --> 01:06:00.940
So what I would say is this.

01:06:00.940 --> 01:06:06.750
I would say adults who can hold
onto their adolescent essence

01:06:06.750 --> 01:06:10.180
are going to live the
most vital kind of life.

01:06:10.180 --> 01:06:12.810
And if you mean by an
outlier that you're

01:06:12.810 --> 01:06:14.430
kind of thinking
outside the box,

01:06:14.430 --> 01:06:17.330
and pushing the limit of
things, and all that's

01:06:17.330 --> 01:06:20.870
a part of adolescent creative
explorations and novelty,

01:06:20.870 --> 01:06:22.590
that's a beautiful thing.

01:06:22.590 --> 01:06:26.519
And so the number 24 doesn't
mean adolescence should end.

01:06:26.519 --> 01:06:28.310
So a lot of these talks,
people come to me,

01:06:28.310 --> 01:06:29.518
I think I'm still adolescent.

01:06:29.518 --> 01:06:30.750
I go, good for you.

01:06:30.750 --> 01:06:34.050
So seriously, I mean,
it's a funny thing.

01:06:34.050 --> 01:06:39.480
The word adolescence
has in some connotations

01:06:39.480 --> 01:06:43.250
a negative spin, like, oh,
you're just adolescent.

01:06:43.250 --> 01:06:47.140
What I hope we can do--
literally we as a society--

01:06:47.140 --> 01:06:49.080
is change the
cultural conversation

01:06:49.080 --> 01:06:50.970
where you realize the
essence of adolescence

01:06:50.970 --> 01:06:53.600
is actually the
essence of adulthood.

01:06:53.600 --> 01:06:55.040
And we shouldn't let it go.

01:06:55.040 --> 01:06:58.740
And we should support people
who make the outliers really

01:06:58.740 --> 01:07:02.009
be filled with
inspiration for everyone.

01:07:02.009 --> 01:07:02.861
RON: Thank you.

01:07:02.861 --> 01:07:04.360
Maybe the natural
follow-up question

01:07:04.360 --> 01:07:05.970
is, do you have
people come up to you

01:07:05.970 --> 01:07:08.620
and say, my spouse
is an adolescent,

01:07:08.620 --> 01:07:10.930
and what can I do about that?

01:07:10.930 --> 01:07:12.469
DANIEL SIEGEL: Yes, I do.

01:07:12.469 --> 01:07:13.760
But that could be a lot of fun.

01:07:16.465 --> 01:07:17.090
RON: Thank you.

01:07:17.090 --> 01:07:18.230
Thank you very much.

01:07:18.230 --> 01:07:20.700
Thank you very much, and we'll
continue the conversation

01:07:20.700 --> 01:07:22.590
outside, have book signing.

01:07:22.590 --> 01:07:23.090
Thank you.

01:07:23.090 --> 01:07:24.910
DANIEL SIEGEL: Thank you.
