00:00:07.120 --> 00:00:08.330
LAURA: Thanks for coming.

00:00:08.330 --> 00:00:12.075
And we're going to be recorded
this talk about we're also

00:00:12.075 --> 00:00:13.750
streaming this to other offices.

00:00:13.750 --> 00:00:16.920
And it's my pleasure to
introduce Dorothy Dankel who

00:00:16.920 --> 00:00:21.464
is going to speak to us on how
to save the oceans with data.

00:00:21.464 --> 00:00:23.005
It's my pleasure to
have her on here.

00:00:27.520 --> 00:00:28.770
DOROTHY DANKEL: Thanks, Laura.

00:00:28.770 --> 00:00:30.410
Thanks for the
invitation to come here.

00:00:30.410 --> 00:00:33.230
I have some cool stuff
to show you guys.

00:00:33.230 --> 00:00:36.840
And I'm looking forward
to see the reaction to it

00:00:36.840 --> 00:00:38.800
because I have a
very ambitious title,

00:00:38.800 --> 00:00:42.270
"How to Save the Ocean with
Integrated Assessments."

00:00:42.270 --> 00:00:46.000
I think I first will
introduce myself a little bit.

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:47.690
I come from Indiana.

00:00:47.690 --> 00:00:52.090
So I'm a Hoosier, but I've lived
the last 14 years in Norway.

00:00:52.090 --> 00:00:56.040
I did my master's and Ph.D.
in Fisheries, Biology,

00:00:56.040 --> 00:00:58.780
and Management at the
University of Bergen in Norway.

00:00:58.780 --> 00:01:01.500
My husband's Norwegian,
and our two daughters

00:01:01.500 --> 00:01:03.340
are Norwegian-Americans.

00:01:03.340 --> 00:01:05.750
We're here in Boston.

00:01:05.750 --> 00:01:07.110
We've been here the past year.

00:01:07.110 --> 00:01:11.460
My husband has had a fellowship
at Joslin Diabetes Center.

00:01:11.460 --> 00:01:13.650
In the last year,
I've been working

00:01:13.650 --> 00:01:15.330
from home on my
Norwegian projects

00:01:15.330 --> 00:01:18.670
and meeting up with as
many people in my network

00:01:18.670 --> 00:01:22.350
as possible while I'm stateside.

00:01:22.350 --> 00:01:24.560
And so now it's kind
of fun to be here.

00:01:24.560 --> 00:01:27.500
I am a postdoc researcher
at the Institute

00:01:27.500 --> 00:01:29.530
of Marine Research
in Bergen, Norway.

00:01:29.530 --> 00:01:32.570
Bergen is on the west coast of
Norway in the fjord country.

00:01:32.570 --> 00:01:36.250
And we're the best-funded
research institution in Norway.

00:01:36.250 --> 00:01:40.770
So we've been doing science
there for over 100 years.

00:01:40.770 --> 00:01:43.140
I'm also at the Center for
the Study of the Sciences

00:01:43.140 --> 00:01:45.260
and the Humanities at the
University of Bergen--

00:01:45.260 --> 00:01:47.210
I work there 30% at
the moment-- where

00:01:47.210 --> 00:01:49.120
I work with philosophers,
anthropologists,

00:01:49.120 --> 00:01:52.807
social scientists, on areas
of ethics and biotechnology

00:01:52.807 --> 00:01:53.890
and these types of things.

00:01:53.890 --> 00:01:56.520
So that's really fun
because I see a lot of ways

00:01:56.520 --> 00:02:01.370
to apply that back to fisheries
and helping save our ocean.

00:02:01.370 --> 00:02:04.750
I'm the chair of the European
working group Maritime Systems

00:02:04.750 --> 00:02:06.440
the past three
years, and I'm also

00:02:06.440 --> 00:02:08.570
a board member on the
Nordic Marine Think Tank.

00:02:08.570 --> 00:02:11.240
So that's a handful
of affiliations,

00:02:11.240 --> 00:02:13.150
which means that I
get a lot of ideas

00:02:13.150 --> 00:02:14.709
from a lot of different places.

00:02:14.709 --> 00:02:16.750
And it's really fun to
kind of put those together

00:02:16.750 --> 00:02:18.490
for a common theme.

00:02:18.490 --> 00:02:21.520
And that is saving the ocean.

00:02:21.520 --> 00:02:25.790
The first question I
want to put forward

00:02:25.790 --> 00:02:30.630
is one that I think most
people here could relate to.

00:02:30.630 --> 00:02:33.260
What if we understood
interactions of humans

00:02:33.260 --> 00:02:34.950
with ecosystems?

00:02:34.950 --> 00:02:37.810
Humans and how they
interact with ecosystems

00:02:37.810 --> 00:02:40.930
is something that is
kind of a broad topic.

00:02:40.930 --> 00:02:43.540
When I was at Laura's
cabin in New Hampshire,

00:02:43.540 --> 00:02:47.220
we started talking about
how Google uses that term

00:02:47.220 --> 00:02:49.510
"ecosystem" and what
does that mean, and how,

00:02:49.510 --> 00:02:53.620
as a biologist, how we
use that term "ecosystem."

00:02:53.620 --> 00:02:57.960
Here's a graphic that our
Institute commissioned

00:02:57.960 --> 00:03:01.210
which is showing the
Barents Sea ecosystem.

00:03:01.210 --> 00:03:05.150
The Barents Sea is the sea
in the very north of Norway,

00:03:05.150 --> 00:03:06.707
shared with Russia.

00:03:06.707 --> 00:03:08.290
This is different
than the Bering Sea,

00:03:08.290 --> 00:03:10.210
which is off the
coast of Alaska.

00:03:10.210 --> 00:03:11.600
This is the Barents Sea.

00:03:11.600 --> 00:03:13.970
And here you see
an idealized type

00:03:13.970 --> 00:03:16.170
of picture of the ecosystem.

00:03:16.170 --> 00:03:18.470
So you have, for
example, the polar bears

00:03:18.470 --> 00:03:21.580
in the Arctic, the
big land mammals.

00:03:21.580 --> 00:03:23.080
And then you have
the ocean mammals,

00:03:23.080 --> 00:03:25.110
and then you have
the different species

00:03:25.110 --> 00:03:28.570
of fish in the different
parts of the water column.

00:03:28.570 --> 00:03:34.650
And here you have cod, the
Norwegian Northeast Atlantic

00:03:34.650 --> 00:03:37.440
cod is the largest cod
stock in the world.

00:03:37.440 --> 00:03:42.680
Last year, the fishing quota
was 2.2 billion pounds,

00:03:42.680 --> 00:03:48.130
over a million metric tons,
which is a very different cod

00:03:48.130 --> 00:03:50.900
stock than the ones found off
the coast of Georges Bank here,

00:03:50.900 --> 00:03:54.790
which collapsed in the '90s and
hasn't really come back ever.

00:03:54.790 --> 00:03:58.720
So we have plenty of
fish and lots of fish

00:03:58.720 --> 00:04:00.440
that we harvest in Norway.

00:04:00.440 --> 00:04:03.360
But the big question
is how we as humans

00:04:03.360 --> 00:04:05.880
interact with these ecosystems.

00:04:05.880 --> 00:04:07.390
When we talk about
ecosystems, we

00:04:07.390 --> 00:04:09.770
can't forget about
the human connection

00:04:09.770 --> 00:04:15.220
because humans are, in
exploited parts of the sea,

00:04:15.220 --> 00:04:20.450
can be the biggest driver of
mortality in the ecosystems.

00:04:20.450 --> 00:04:22.840
So what I'm going to
talk a little bit today

00:04:22.840 --> 00:04:26.540
is I'm going to outline
the problem of how

00:04:26.540 --> 00:04:30.530
to save the ocean, how to manage
the ocean sustainably and give

00:04:30.530 --> 00:04:32.260
you a little bit of
background on that

00:04:32.260 --> 00:04:34.440
and then start looking
for some solutions,

00:04:34.440 --> 00:04:37.870
some bio-socioeconomic
models that I have quantified

00:04:37.870 --> 00:04:40.690
for the Barents Sea,
the use of data,

00:04:40.690 --> 00:04:44.960
and the potential
for collaboration

00:04:44.960 --> 00:04:49.020
from government institutions
across from the politics

00:04:49.020 --> 00:04:53.680
of governments and getting
in private foundations

00:04:53.680 --> 00:04:56.750
and enterprises into the game.

00:04:56.750 --> 00:05:01.910
The issue here is, how can we
sustainably manage the ocean?

00:05:01.910 --> 00:05:04.750
And I'm going to go into
a little bit of philosophy

00:05:04.750 --> 00:05:08.070
first because I think, in
order for us to really examine

00:05:08.070 --> 00:05:10.330
the problem, it's
really nice when

00:05:10.330 --> 00:05:14.330
we can look at people who
have really examined science

00:05:14.330 --> 00:05:16.870
because that's what we're
talking about in the beginning.

00:05:16.870 --> 00:05:21.280
So I don't know if people are
familiar with the Thomas Kuhn

00:05:21.280 --> 00:05:22.630
cycle.

00:05:22.630 --> 00:05:26.780
Thomas Kuhn is a
philosopher of science.

00:05:26.780 --> 00:05:30.330
This book was
published in the 1962.

00:05:30.330 --> 00:05:32.800
And this is the Kuhn
cycle of science.

00:05:32.800 --> 00:05:34.555
And this is Science
with a big S,

00:05:34.555 --> 00:05:36.900
a very generic view of science.

00:05:36.900 --> 00:05:39.020
So this can be applied
to any part of science.

00:05:39.020 --> 00:05:42.390
But when you start in the
normal science paradigm,

00:05:42.390 --> 00:05:46.940
you start with science as a
puzzle-solving entity, right?

00:05:46.940 --> 00:05:48.780
So you have problems
and you have puzzles

00:05:48.780 --> 00:05:51.060
and you're trying to solve it.

00:05:51.060 --> 00:05:56.950
In this paradigm cycle, you get
to what's called model drift.

00:05:56.950 --> 00:06:00.570
And that's when you're less
able to solve problems using

00:06:00.570 --> 00:06:04.650
the models and the
data that you have.

00:06:04.650 --> 00:06:07.210
Getting into a little
bit of French philosophy,

00:06:07.210 --> 00:06:10.600
Ivan Illich, who was
active in the 19th century,

00:06:10.600 --> 00:06:14.290
has some interesting ideas
of why you would actually

00:06:14.290 --> 00:06:16.310
get model drift.

00:06:16.310 --> 00:06:18.610
There's two books that
I want to point out,

00:06:18.610 --> 00:06:21.720
"Deschooling Society" and
"Tools for Conviviality,"

00:06:21.720 --> 00:06:23.010
which is really interesting.

00:06:23.010 --> 00:06:24.530
I'm just going to
put this problem

00:06:24.530 --> 00:06:27.830
that he puts forth to you.

00:06:27.830 --> 00:06:30.720
He starts out with the
institutionalization

00:06:30.720 --> 00:06:31.510
of education.

00:06:31.510 --> 00:06:34.790
We know this from centuries.

00:06:34.790 --> 00:06:37.490
We've institutionalized
how we educate people.

00:06:37.490 --> 00:06:40.990
Which gets into the
institutionalization society,

00:06:40.990 --> 00:06:44.390
which gives power to
the technocratic elite.

00:06:44.390 --> 00:06:46.790
This means that if
you go to a school

00:06:46.790 --> 00:06:48.960
where you learn
certain techniques that

00:06:48.960 --> 00:06:50.690
are used for
policy, for example,

00:06:50.690 --> 00:06:53.340
this becomes a very
technocratic exercise.

00:06:53.340 --> 00:06:54.770
Science becomes power.

00:06:54.770 --> 00:06:57.530
Science becomes how
we make decisions.

00:06:57.530 --> 00:07:00.060
And if you get that,
you can be stealing

00:07:00.060 --> 00:07:02.860
the power of the citizens'
practical knowledge.

00:07:02.860 --> 00:07:05.110
This becomes relevant
in resource management

00:07:05.110 --> 00:07:08.450
because, in resource management,
we deal with stakeholders.

00:07:08.450 --> 00:07:09.690
We deal with our fishermen.

00:07:09.690 --> 00:07:12.770
We deal with the
producers on shore.

00:07:12.770 --> 00:07:14.770
We deal with consumers.

00:07:14.770 --> 00:07:19.110
And this is a example of
some Florida fishermen

00:07:19.110 --> 00:07:22.350
who are protesting
some science coming

00:07:22.350 --> 00:07:24.170
from NOAA in the
recreational fisheries.

00:07:27.200 --> 00:07:31.160
They're protesting that it's
a very hierarchical system.

00:07:31.160 --> 00:07:33.680
Their livelihoods are based
on the fishing quotas.

00:07:33.680 --> 00:07:36.250
The fishing quotas are based
on the stock assessments.

00:07:36.250 --> 00:07:37.880
And the stock
assessments can only

00:07:37.880 --> 00:07:41.640
be run by these technocratic
elite scientists.

00:07:41.640 --> 00:07:43.500
So this is an
interesting framing

00:07:43.500 --> 00:07:46.440
of the problem of model drift.

00:07:46.440 --> 00:07:49.190
So after model drift,
we get to model crisis

00:07:49.190 --> 00:07:53.010
where we see that all of a
sudden our methods don't work.

00:07:53.010 --> 00:07:55.300
In a fisheries
prospective, this has

00:07:55.300 --> 00:07:57.940
been outlined in the literature.

00:07:57.940 --> 00:08:01.150
Here's one article from
"Science" stemming the alarming

00:08:01.150 --> 00:08:02.770
trends in the world's
fisheries demand

00:08:02.770 --> 00:08:04.840
a fundamental change in
management and fishing

00:08:04.840 --> 00:08:06.300
practices.

00:08:06.300 --> 00:08:10.980
Another paper points to the
lack of an integrated solution

00:08:10.980 --> 00:08:13.750
to the complexity in
managing world resources.

00:08:13.750 --> 00:08:17.100
And we have not achieved
that integrated solution.

00:08:17.100 --> 00:08:19.120
Of course, an
integrated solution

00:08:19.120 --> 00:08:23.950
must be based on
integrated data.

00:08:23.950 --> 00:08:26.250
There's really no
other way around that.

00:08:26.250 --> 00:08:30.220
And so, then, the next
step is model revolution.

00:08:30.220 --> 00:08:32.100
But there's a famous
fisheries biologist

00:08:32.100 --> 00:08:34.120
in the University of Washington.

00:08:34.120 --> 00:08:36.010
His name is Ray Hilborn.

00:08:36.010 --> 00:08:39.429
And he points to the fact
that managing fisheries

00:08:39.429 --> 00:08:41.250
is managing people, right?

00:08:41.250 --> 00:08:42.789
We don't manage fish.

00:08:42.789 --> 00:08:44.640
We manage fishermen.

00:08:44.640 --> 00:08:48.760
And here he says that, I believe
rocket scientists have it easy.

00:08:48.760 --> 00:08:50.700
The USA was able to
put a man on the moon

00:08:50.700 --> 00:08:53.320
within a decade of
setting that goal.

00:08:53.320 --> 00:08:55.790
Achieving biologically and
economically sustainable

00:08:55.790 --> 00:08:58.560
fisheries has
proven more elusive.

00:08:58.560 --> 00:09:04.550
He even alludes to the idea
of physics envy, right?

00:09:04.550 --> 00:09:07.560
So physicists and
pure mathematicians--

00:09:07.560 --> 00:09:10.910
they're able to have their
experiments with closed

00:09:10.910 --> 00:09:14.140
variables and actually
run them and get results.

00:09:14.140 --> 00:09:15.730
With ocean management
and fisheries,

00:09:15.730 --> 00:09:17.330
we don't have that luxury.

00:09:17.330 --> 00:09:20.740
We have to deal with not only
the vastness of the ocean

00:09:20.740 --> 00:09:22.930
but the complexity of
the human dimension

00:09:22.930 --> 00:09:25.860
because it's the
humans who are fishing

00:09:25.860 --> 00:09:27.920
and the humans who are
running the models giving

00:09:27.920 --> 00:09:30.160
the scientific advice.

00:09:30.160 --> 00:09:33.230
So, in the Kuhn cycle, the
next step is model revolution.

00:09:33.230 --> 00:09:37.240
And this happens when you
figure out what you really need.

00:09:37.240 --> 00:09:41.760
In a fisheries perspective,
this is a systems view.

00:09:41.760 --> 00:09:44.280
Now, there's three parts
of the fishery system.

00:09:44.280 --> 00:09:49.920
This is from a book in 2012
by Tony Charles in Canada.

00:09:49.920 --> 00:09:52.850
We're used to talking about
the natural ecosystem, about

00:09:52.850 --> 00:09:55.110
our fish and our fishing quotas.

00:09:55.110 --> 00:09:59.980
We're not used to talking about
how the natural ecosystem has

00:09:59.980 --> 00:10:02.180
feedbacks with the
management system.

00:10:02.180 --> 00:10:03.870
So when we set a
fishing quota and it's

00:10:03.870 --> 00:10:05.980
implemented and the
politics of sharing

00:10:05.980 --> 00:10:10.000
fishing quotas, the politics
of negotiating fishing quotas

00:10:10.000 --> 00:10:12.440
and how that connects
to the human system.

00:10:12.440 --> 00:10:15.600
So you have community,
consumers, households,

00:10:15.600 --> 00:10:18.960
people who are eating fish,
people who are processing fish,

00:10:18.960 --> 00:10:21.670
people who are fixing
boats that fishermen use.

00:10:21.670 --> 00:10:24.150
This is all integrated.

00:10:24.150 --> 00:10:27.060
And you can only
approach this when

00:10:27.060 --> 00:10:29.620
you're talking about
interdisciplinary science.

00:10:29.620 --> 00:10:33.190
Each of these three systems
has quantifiable data

00:10:33.190 --> 00:10:34.940
that we can get.

00:10:34.940 --> 00:10:37.190
And if you want to
look at fisheries

00:10:37.190 --> 00:10:39.550
and manage the
oceans sustainably,

00:10:39.550 --> 00:10:41.750
you must not forget
this complexity.

00:10:41.750 --> 00:10:44.670
We're not going to
solve the sustainability

00:10:44.670 --> 00:10:47.300
issues in our ocean
by only looking

00:10:47.300 --> 00:10:49.710
at the natural ecosystem.

00:10:49.710 --> 00:10:54.060
Which has been the status
quo the last 50 years.

00:10:54.060 --> 00:10:55.530
So that's our model revolution.

00:10:55.530 --> 00:10:57.330
You figure out what
you really need.

00:10:57.330 --> 00:10:58.720
We need a systems view.

00:10:58.720 --> 00:11:02.830
We need to incorporate the data
from different parts, not just

00:11:02.830 --> 00:11:04.670
the biological system.

00:11:04.670 --> 00:11:07.120
And then in the Kuhn
cycle in this book,

00:11:07.120 --> 00:11:10.090
in 1962, "The Structure of
Scientific Revolutions,"

00:11:10.090 --> 00:11:14.020
he talks about paradigm
change is the next step.

00:11:14.020 --> 00:11:17.080
He's the one who coined
the term "paradigm shift."

00:11:17.080 --> 00:11:18.620
You've probably heard of that.

00:11:18.620 --> 00:11:22.440
And in order to get a
paradigm change in science,

00:11:22.440 --> 00:11:24.530
you have to get some
sort of consensus.

00:11:24.530 --> 00:11:26.470
And this is what
is kind of missing,

00:11:26.470 --> 00:11:30.590
and this is what I want to
put forward as a missing link.

00:11:30.590 --> 00:11:32.510
Let me just show
you this dichotomy

00:11:32.510 --> 00:11:36.230
between normal science
and post-normal science

00:11:36.230 --> 00:11:38.370
is the term I'm going
to introduce right now.

00:11:38.370 --> 00:11:41.220
Normal science is what
I've just been alluding to.

00:11:41.220 --> 00:11:44.310
This Thomas Kuhn's
definition-- puzzle-solving,

00:11:44.310 --> 00:11:46.320
relatively routine
work of scientists,

00:11:46.320 --> 00:11:48.860
experimenting within
a paradigm and never

00:11:48.860 --> 00:11:50.480
really challenging
that paradigm.

00:11:50.480 --> 00:11:52.640
They're just doing
their day-to-day work.

00:11:52.640 --> 00:11:55.420
Whereas post-normal
science, by my colleagues

00:11:55.420 --> 00:11:59.000
Silvio Funtowicz and
Jerry Ravetz-- Silvio

00:11:59.000 --> 00:12:00.780
is still a professor.

00:12:00.780 --> 00:12:02.570
He's been all over the
world, but now he's

00:12:02.570 --> 00:12:05.180
landed in Bergen, which
is exciting for us.

00:12:05.180 --> 00:12:07.310
And Jerry Ravetz,
who just retired.

00:12:07.310 --> 00:12:09.520
In the early '90s,
they put forward this.

00:12:09.520 --> 00:12:11.350
Post-normal science
is a methodology

00:12:11.350 --> 00:12:16.650
of inquiry for cases
where facts are uncertain,

00:12:16.650 --> 00:12:19.410
values are in dispute,
stakes are high,

00:12:19.410 --> 00:12:21.790
and decisions are urgent.

00:12:21.790 --> 00:12:23.860
Now, the poster
child for post-normal

00:12:23.860 --> 00:12:26.080
is climate science, right?

00:12:26.080 --> 00:12:28.990
You have very uncertain
models, uncertain predictions,

00:12:28.990 --> 00:12:31.590
at the same time,
values are in dispute.

00:12:31.590 --> 00:12:33.350
Who is going to pay?

00:12:33.350 --> 00:12:34.180
for example.

00:12:34.180 --> 00:12:37.090
The stakes are high, and
the decisions are urgent.

00:12:37.090 --> 00:12:39.390
We must make decisions
today if we're

00:12:39.390 --> 00:12:42.360
going to get on a
sustainable path.

00:12:42.360 --> 00:12:44.610
But since values are
embedded in science,

00:12:44.610 --> 00:12:47.050
post-normal science should
integrate stakeholders

00:12:47.050 --> 00:12:49.150
in an extended peer community.

00:12:49.150 --> 00:12:51.490
The extended peer
community means

00:12:51.490 --> 00:12:53.720
that sometimes the
questions scientists

00:12:53.720 --> 00:12:57.510
are asked when having
to advise policy

00:12:57.510 --> 00:12:59.590
are not scientific questions.

00:12:59.590 --> 00:13:01.430
They're questions
based on values,

00:13:01.430 --> 00:13:03.680
based on the
objectives for society.

00:13:03.680 --> 00:13:05.930
And this is the
post-normal paradigm.

00:13:05.930 --> 00:13:08.120
This is where you have
to get different people

00:13:08.120 --> 00:13:11.360
around the same table
to discuss this.

00:13:11.360 --> 00:13:15.340
So in this diagram, you have, on
the x-axis, systems uncertainty

00:13:15.340 --> 00:13:18.980
from low to high and
decision stakes on the y-axis

00:13:18.980 --> 00:13:20.220
from low to high.

00:13:20.220 --> 00:13:22.730
And that green area in the
bottom left-hand corner

00:13:22.730 --> 00:13:24.900
is where you have
applied science.

00:13:24.900 --> 00:13:28.000
This is the physics envy,
where you have low systems

00:13:28.000 --> 00:13:31.670
uncertainty but the decision
stakes are very big.

00:13:31.670 --> 00:13:34.060
Professional consultancy
is the next level,

00:13:34.060 --> 00:13:37.570
and post-normal science is this
area where systems uncertainty

00:13:37.570 --> 00:13:41.280
is high as well as
the decision stakes.

00:13:41.280 --> 00:13:41.780
OK.

00:13:41.780 --> 00:13:44.800
So now I've introduced the
idea of post-normal science

00:13:44.800 --> 00:13:47.260
and maybe you think,
OK, that could be right.

00:13:47.260 --> 00:13:48.760
But what does it
actually look like?

00:13:48.760 --> 00:13:50.830
Can you put it into pictures?

00:13:50.830 --> 00:13:56.130
Normal science a la
Kuhn is this poor woman

00:13:56.130 --> 00:13:57.980
under all her papers,
this academic.

00:13:57.980 --> 00:14:01.790
It's mono-disciplinary,
technocratic, certain,

00:14:01.790 --> 00:14:02.900
and predictive.

00:14:02.900 --> 00:14:06.380
Whereas post-normal science
is academic and social,

00:14:06.380 --> 00:14:09.760
trans-disciplinary,
participative, uncertain,

00:14:09.760 --> 00:14:11.480
and exploratory.

00:14:11.480 --> 00:14:14.770
And you have people around
the table, different experts

00:14:14.770 --> 00:14:18.050
from different disciplines,
also including the stakeholders

00:14:18.050 --> 00:14:19.940
and politicians.

00:14:19.940 --> 00:14:23.630
So perhaps one of the reasons
that we've had so much trouble

00:14:23.630 --> 00:14:27.170
managing our natural renewable
resources and climate change,

00:14:27.170 --> 00:14:30.740
for example, is that it's hard
for us to admit that science

00:14:30.740 --> 00:14:32.920
cannot give us the one answer.

00:14:32.920 --> 00:14:36.310
Even if we had all the
best data in the world,

00:14:36.310 --> 00:14:40.930
we still have values and other
social concerns at stake.

00:14:40.930 --> 00:14:44.460
Which are not necessarily
scientific questions.

00:14:44.460 --> 00:14:45.050
OK.

00:14:45.050 --> 00:14:48.090
So I gave you a little
bit of background.

00:14:48.090 --> 00:14:53.980
And I'm going to now focus
more specifically on oceans.

00:14:53.980 --> 00:14:57.640
And here are some illustrations
by my friend and colleague

00:14:57.640 --> 00:15:01.700
Mariano [INAUDIBLE], who's
at the University of Valencia

00:15:01.700 --> 00:15:06.300
in Spain, to kind of illustrate
the problems that we have

00:15:06.300 --> 00:15:09.180
from an ocean and
fisheries perspective.

00:15:09.180 --> 00:15:12.350
So this is a music box.

00:15:12.350 --> 00:15:16.540
And one thing that we learn from
studying ecosystems and giving

00:15:16.540 --> 00:15:19.680
ecosystem-based
advice is the whole

00:15:19.680 --> 00:15:21.880
is greater than the
sum of the parts.

00:15:21.880 --> 00:15:25.730
And I put the whole
as a capital W.

00:15:25.730 --> 00:15:28.910
And when I talk about the
Ocean, I use a capital O.

00:15:28.910 --> 00:15:32.500
And this is because
this is one word that's

00:15:32.500 --> 00:15:35.460
encompassing very many things.

00:15:35.460 --> 00:15:38.510
And a music box, you can
break it down to its parts.

00:15:38.510 --> 00:15:40.560
But you can never
necessarily guess

00:15:40.560 --> 00:15:43.810
from its parts, when you
turn the crank and the music

00:15:43.810 --> 00:15:47.470
comes out, how that affects
you as a person, what joys,

00:15:47.470 --> 00:15:49.620
or what turmoils, or
everything that you

00:15:49.620 --> 00:15:54.030
get from that music, kind of
illustrating that the whole is

00:15:54.030 --> 00:15:56.230
greater than the
sum of the parts.

00:15:56.230 --> 00:15:58.310
Now, here's our history lesson.

00:15:58.310 --> 00:16:00.840
We're going to go all the way
back to the French Revolution.

00:16:00.840 --> 00:16:04.020
And this train of thought
is coming from the professor

00:16:04.020 --> 00:16:06.301
emeritus at Harvard EO Wilson.

00:16:06.301 --> 00:16:07.800
I don't know if
you've heard of him.

00:16:07.800 --> 00:16:08.630
He's still living.

00:16:08.630 --> 00:16:10.060
He's approaching 90.

00:16:10.060 --> 00:16:13.680
He has a book from 1998
called "Consilience

00:16:13.680 --> 00:16:15.250
the Unity of Knowledge."

00:16:15.250 --> 00:16:17.920
And he explains in the
introduction of the book

00:16:17.920 --> 00:16:21.270
that we can really blame a
lot of our scientific problems

00:16:21.270 --> 00:16:22.630
on the French Revolution.

00:16:22.630 --> 00:16:25.600
And let me quickly
explained that.

00:16:25.600 --> 00:16:28.480
Before the French Revolution,
you had a monarchy, right?

00:16:28.480 --> 00:16:30.450
All the different
scientists in the kingdom

00:16:30.450 --> 00:16:34.000
were reporting to
one person, the king.

00:16:34.000 --> 00:16:37.250
So if the king had a grand
challenge or a problem

00:16:37.250 --> 00:16:40.960
or something that he
wanted to fix or find out.

00:16:40.960 --> 00:16:43.170
For example, I want
to have the best

00:16:43.170 --> 00:16:46.110
wine in all of the kingdoms.

00:16:46.110 --> 00:16:49.960
So he would put his
biologists, his scientists,

00:16:49.960 --> 00:16:52.620
his philosophers,
his economists all at

00:16:52.620 --> 00:16:54.920
work for that one
single purpose.

00:16:54.920 --> 00:16:58.285
And so the biologists would have
to make the perfect vineyards.

00:16:58.285 --> 00:16:59.910
The economists would
have to figure out

00:16:59.910 --> 00:17:02.990
how to do it efficiently
to scale it up.

00:17:02.990 --> 00:17:05.740
The philosophers would have
to think, what makes the best

00:17:05.740 --> 00:17:07.939
wine? and all those
types of things.

00:17:07.939 --> 00:17:10.480
But at the end of the day, they
were reporting to one person.

00:17:10.480 --> 00:17:13.480
So it was a unity of knowledge.

00:17:13.480 --> 00:17:16.940
After the French Revolution,
they cut the king's head off,

00:17:16.940 --> 00:17:18.970
cut Marie Antoinette's head off.

00:17:18.970 --> 00:17:23.829
And now the political
system is more democratic.

00:17:23.829 --> 00:17:24.680
It's more flat.

00:17:24.680 --> 00:17:28.550
It's not this top-down,
hierarchical system.

00:17:28.550 --> 00:17:32.550
And the disciplines in science
became very disciplined,

00:17:32.550 --> 00:17:36.390
which was great because we
had a huge advances in math,

00:17:36.390 --> 00:17:40.370
and biology, genetics, all
these different things.

00:17:40.370 --> 00:17:45.520
But in the 21st century,
we're still thinking, OK,

00:17:45.520 --> 00:17:49.670
that's great that we know
how to sequence DNA and do

00:17:49.670 --> 00:17:50.350
all this stuff.

00:17:50.350 --> 00:17:51.460
Great.

00:17:51.460 --> 00:17:53.330
Where's the cure for cancer?

00:17:53.330 --> 00:17:55.020
How are we going to get there?

00:17:55.020 --> 00:17:58.110
Because what we know
is the grand challenges

00:17:58.110 --> 00:18:00.650
that we have today in
society-- climate change

00:18:00.650 --> 00:18:03.590
and all of these things--
is not up to one discipline.

00:18:03.590 --> 00:18:06.180
You must have a
unity of knowledge.

00:18:06.180 --> 00:18:08.310
So after the French
Revolution, the disciplines

00:18:08.310 --> 00:18:10.780
separated from the whole.

00:18:10.780 --> 00:18:13.716
And we got a very
disciplined view of science.

00:18:13.716 --> 00:18:15.340
Here's a picture of
a fisherman looking

00:18:15.340 --> 00:18:18.490
through a little peephole
as an illustration

00:18:18.490 --> 00:18:20.600
that the ocean is very vast.

00:18:20.600 --> 00:18:23.650
If we just use biology
in our limited views

00:18:23.650 --> 00:18:25.800
of how we can look
at the ocean, we're

00:18:25.800 --> 00:18:27.850
not getting the whole system.

00:18:27.850 --> 00:18:29.980
We're too disciplined.

00:18:29.980 --> 00:18:32.750
And this leads us to very
confused and frustrated

00:18:32.750 --> 00:18:33.910
decision-makers.

00:18:33.910 --> 00:18:35.790
Here you have a
decision-maker who

00:18:35.790 --> 00:18:37.540
has three different
scientists telling him

00:18:37.540 --> 00:18:38.590
three different things.

00:18:38.590 --> 00:18:39.980
Three different sources of data.

00:18:39.980 --> 00:18:41.170
What's going on?

00:18:41.170 --> 00:18:43.050
The decision-maker
then makes a decision

00:18:43.050 --> 00:18:47.380
based on the stakeholder or the
scientist who yells the loudest

00:18:47.380 --> 00:18:49.420
or whom he trusts the most.

00:18:49.420 --> 00:18:54.560
And we get politics
not necessarily based

00:18:54.560 --> 00:18:57.780
on a collective view of science.

00:18:57.780 --> 00:19:00.270
So there's a call for
consilience of knowledge, which

00:19:00.270 --> 00:19:03.280
means unity of knowledge,
moving towards interdisciplinary

00:19:03.280 --> 00:19:04.720
and systems view of the whole.

00:19:04.720 --> 00:19:06.970
This is the picture
post-normal science.

00:19:06.970 --> 00:19:10.220
This is where you have your
biologists, your politician,

00:19:10.220 --> 00:19:13.950
your philosopher, your
fisherman, your economists all

00:19:13.950 --> 00:19:14.900
around the same table.

00:19:14.900 --> 00:19:17.080
It's a very iterative process.

00:19:17.080 --> 00:19:18.830
Many, many meetings.

00:19:18.830 --> 00:19:22.070
The thing is that the
system has to be driven,

00:19:22.070 --> 00:19:26.710
that everybody is in
on this game of getting

00:19:26.710 --> 00:19:28.840
together and talking
and talking and talking

00:19:28.840 --> 00:19:33.270
and talking and discussing
how we put these together,

00:19:33.270 --> 00:19:38.000
what data is useful for
us, and all these things.

00:19:40.311 --> 00:19:40.810
OK.

00:19:40.810 --> 00:19:43.020
Let's get a little
bit towards solutions.

00:19:43.020 --> 00:19:46.799
I think it's important
to have this idea that,

00:19:46.799 --> 00:19:48.340
OK, if there's a
will, there's a way.

00:19:48.340 --> 00:19:50.500
We have tons of data.

00:19:50.500 --> 00:19:52.810
If there's one thing that we
do well it's collect data.

00:19:52.810 --> 00:19:55.850
I'm going to show you some
examples of the type of data

00:19:55.850 --> 00:19:59.690
that we collect in fisheries
and ocean management.

00:19:59.690 --> 00:20:02.220
But it's very
important that we have

00:20:02.220 --> 00:20:04.480
this idea of the
focus imaginarius.

00:20:04.480 --> 00:20:09.520
The 18th century
philosopher Immanuel Kant

00:20:09.520 --> 00:20:12.240
describes the focus
imaginarius as such.

00:20:12.240 --> 00:20:15.570
It is something that you know
very well what it looks like.

00:20:15.570 --> 00:20:16.980
It's the perfect picture.

00:20:16.980 --> 00:20:19.080
It's the perfect ocean
managed perfectly.

00:20:19.080 --> 00:20:20.700
Everybody's perfectly happy.

00:20:20.700 --> 00:20:25.050
It's what you can imagine could
happen, and it's your focus.

00:20:25.050 --> 00:20:28.090
You're not naive to think that
you're ever going to get there,

00:20:28.090 --> 00:20:31.460
but you must have some
sort of goal to go towards.

00:20:31.460 --> 00:20:35.520
So I'm going to show you
three steps on will and way.

00:20:35.520 --> 00:20:37.960
So as will gets higher
and way gets higher,

00:20:37.960 --> 00:20:42.220
you get closer to your
focus imaginarius.

00:20:42.220 --> 00:20:45.220
So first let's talk
about status quo.

00:20:45.220 --> 00:20:48.170
What do we do today when we
are giving fishing advice

00:20:48.170 --> 00:20:50.790
and managing the ocean?

00:20:50.790 --> 00:20:53.320
This is taken from ICES.

00:20:53.320 --> 00:20:56.340
So it's I-C-E-S. It stands
for the International Council

00:20:56.340 --> 00:20:58.500
for the Exploration of the Sea.

00:20:58.500 --> 00:21:02.100
ICES is the world's oldest
intergovernmental organization.

00:21:02.100 --> 00:21:06.520
It's over 100 years old
and collects all the data

00:21:06.520 --> 00:21:08.630
in Europe, with
some collaboration

00:21:08.630 --> 00:21:11.880
with Canada and
the United States.

00:21:11.880 --> 00:21:13.730
Does the science, does
the stock assessments

00:21:13.730 --> 00:21:15.780
to give the fishing advice.

00:21:15.780 --> 00:21:18.850
Now, there is no real
will, political will

00:21:18.850 --> 00:21:20.200
for an integrated assessment.

00:21:20.200 --> 00:21:23.610
The politicians don't know how
they would use it, basically.

00:21:23.610 --> 00:21:27.410
So ICES keeps doing status
quo, single stock assessment

00:21:27.410 --> 00:21:29.030
and derives their advice.

00:21:29.030 --> 00:21:33.380
This is the popularized
sheet that they give out

00:21:33.380 --> 00:21:34.580
for each stock.

00:21:34.580 --> 00:21:37.480
There's a lot more sheets.

00:21:37.480 --> 00:21:39.980
The whole assessment
working group report

00:21:39.980 --> 00:21:42.620
could be from 100
to 200 pages long,

00:21:42.620 --> 00:21:45.150
but they give this sheet
as a popularized version.

00:21:45.150 --> 00:21:47.536
This is for cod
in the North Sea.

00:21:47.536 --> 00:21:53.190
For 2014, the advice was that,
based on the EU Norway Plan,

00:21:53.190 --> 00:21:59.160
the landings in 2014 should be
no more than 28,809 tons, which

00:21:59.160 --> 00:22:03.730
happens to be 9% less than the
2013 total allowable catch.

00:22:03.730 --> 00:22:04.230
OK.

00:22:04.230 --> 00:22:05.280
What does this mean?

00:22:05.280 --> 00:22:08.510
28,809 tons.

00:22:08.510 --> 00:22:10.670
Here we have five
significant digits.

00:22:10.670 --> 00:22:16.190
So you might think that the
science of stock assessment

00:22:16.190 --> 00:22:17.790
is really quite certain.

00:22:17.790 --> 00:22:18.290
OK.

00:22:18.290 --> 00:22:20.373
Well, they really know
what they're talking about.

00:22:20.373 --> 00:22:22.410
For one year, they can
fish that much and this

00:22:22.410 --> 00:22:26.480
is going to result in
sustainable fishing.

00:22:26.480 --> 00:22:30.670
The fact of the matter is this
is very, very sloppy work on

00:22:30.670 --> 00:22:31.630
how we give advice.

00:22:31.630 --> 00:22:34.510
There's no way we
could ever have

00:22:34.510 --> 00:22:37.930
five significant
digits of certainty.

00:22:37.930 --> 00:22:40.880
I call it sloppy, but
this is just routine.

00:22:40.880 --> 00:22:43.420
This is how they've been
doing it for 20 years.

00:22:43.420 --> 00:22:45.350
This is what the
policy makers expect.

00:22:45.350 --> 00:22:46.670
This has been negotiated.

00:22:46.670 --> 00:22:49.330
This is what is done.

00:22:49.330 --> 00:22:52.440
That's a basis of
a whole other talk

00:22:52.440 --> 00:22:54.390
that I just gave at [INAUDIBLE].

00:22:54.390 --> 00:22:57.470
So I'm starting to do
something about this.

00:22:57.470 --> 00:23:01.920
But first we have to be serious
about what science can give us

00:23:01.920 --> 00:23:03.500
and what science can't give us.

00:23:03.500 --> 00:23:05.110
Science can't give
us that certainty.

00:23:05.110 --> 00:23:07.910
And we have to be honest
with our policy makers

00:23:07.910 --> 00:23:09.710
on what science
can do and not do.

00:23:09.710 --> 00:23:12.460
It's part of the
Occupy Science Movement

00:23:12.460 --> 00:23:15.290
that I allude to a
little bit later.

00:23:15.290 --> 00:23:15.790
OK.

00:23:15.790 --> 00:23:18.520
So getting a little
bit more will

00:23:18.520 --> 00:23:21.540
to do an integrated assessment
and a little bit combining

00:23:21.540 --> 00:23:22.810
more data sources.

00:23:22.810 --> 00:23:25.350
I have this paper from 2009.

00:23:25.350 --> 00:23:27.270
You might actually
recognize this map.

00:23:27.270 --> 00:23:30.870
So here we are in Cambridge.

00:23:30.870 --> 00:23:33.600
And here off the coast of
Massachusetts and Cape Cod

00:23:33.600 --> 00:23:34.660
is Georges Bank.

00:23:34.660 --> 00:23:37.110
Maybe you have heard
of Georges Bank.

00:23:37.110 --> 00:23:39.060
Used to be one of the
most productive fishing

00:23:39.060 --> 00:23:40.560
areas in the world.

00:23:40.560 --> 00:23:43.600
People have been fishing
there for over 1,000 years.

00:23:43.600 --> 00:23:46.620
In Georges Bank, you have a
really interesting dynamic

00:23:46.620 --> 00:23:49.410
at the current moment right now.

00:23:49.410 --> 00:23:53.320
I have overlaid this map on
some of the data from NOAA.

00:23:53.320 --> 00:23:55.880
I'm just going to explain
the axes really quickly.

00:23:55.880 --> 00:23:59.550
The x-axis here is your biomass.

00:23:59.550 --> 00:24:01.800
This is the data
from 2007, and this

00:24:01.800 --> 00:24:04.710
is over the biomass at
maximum sustainable yield.

00:24:04.710 --> 00:24:07.680
MSY is our term there.

00:24:07.680 --> 00:24:11.790
So basically from zero to a lot.

00:24:11.790 --> 00:24:15.240
And on the y-axis, our
fishing mortality rate.

00:24:15.240 --> 00:24:18.690
This is how much fishing is
happening in proportion, where

00:24:18.690 --> 00:24:21.340
you have zero fishing
here and a lot.

00:24:21.340 --> 00:24:24.100
So in this area where
it's red, the fish

00:24:24.100 --> 00:24:27.000
that are plotted-- each
of these little dots

00:24:27.000 --> 00:24:30.980
is a fish stock from
Georges Bank-- in this area,

00:24:30.980 --> 00:24:33.330
the fish plotted
here are overfished

00:24:33.330 --> 00:24:35.540
and overfishing is occurring.

00:24:35.540 --> 00:24:37.910
Whereas down here where
you have a lot of biomass

00:24:37.910 --> 00:24:40.380
and not a lot of
fishing happening,

00:24:40.380 --> 00:24:43.060
these stocks are not
overfishing and overfishing

00:24:43.060 --> 00:24:44.810
is not occurring.

00:24:44.810 --> 00:24:46.590
So what you have here
on Georges Bank--

00:24:46.590 --> 00:24:48.465
you have Georges
Bank haddock here.

00:24:48.465 --> 00:24:49.590
This is what it looks like.

00:24:49.590 --> 00:24:51.810
You have a lot, a surplus.

00:24:51.810 --> 00:24:54.600
We still have a surplus on
Georges Bank of haddock,

00:24:54.600 --> 00:24:57.640
but Georges Bank
cod and yellow tail

00:24:57.640 --> 00:25:01.590
flounder are overfished and
overfishing is occurring.

00:25:01.590 --> 00:25:05.580
Which means the fishermen want
to target haddock and leave

00:25:05.580 --> 00:25:07.870
the cod and yellowtail to be.

00:25:07.870 --> 00:25:11.100
However, they cannot do
this because the technology,

00:25:11.100 --> 00:25:15.700
the gear technology, when
they're dragging the Otter

00:25:15.700 --> 00:25:18.520
trawl, the net, along the sea
bottom and destroying a lot

00:25:18.520 --> 00:25:21.940
of habitat in their wake,
they're catching cod and yellow

00:25:21.940 --> 00:25:24.330
tail as a by-catch of haddock.

00:25:24.330 --> 00:25:31.420
They cannot only target haddock
until relatively recently.

00:25:31.420 --> 00:25:32.420
And let me just explain.

00:25:32.420 --> 00:25:36.697
This is why I wanted to have
a mic that moves because this

00:25:36.697 --> 00:25:38.530
is where I get to use
my hands a little bit.

00:25:41.900 --> 00:25:43.140
This is where biology comes.

00:25:43.140 --> 00:25:47.720
When the trawl-- this is
the trawl, the net-- when

00:25:47.720 --> 00:25:49.670
it's being dragged
along the sea floor,

00:25:49.670 --> 00:25:52.450
the reaction, the biological
reaction, for haddock

00:25:52.450 --> 00:25:53.826
is to swim up.

00:25:53.826 --> 00:25:55.200
It doesn't want
to go in the net.

00:25:55.200 --> 00:25:56.700
They're not that dumb.

00:25:56.700 --> 00:25:57.870
And it swims up.

00:25:57.870 --> 00:26:02.260
Whereas the cod and the yellow
tail swim down along the floor.

00:26:02.260 --> 00:26:04.660
These are all bottom creatures.

00:26:04.660 --> 00:26:07.650
So some fishermen and some
scientists got this good idea

00:26:07.650 --> 00:26:09.890
and they created the Ruhle
trawl, which is basically

00:26:09.890 --> 00:26:11.640
the same thing as
an Otter trawl,

00:26:11.640 --> 00:26:14.900
but they just lift it one
yard off the bottom of the sea

00:26:14.900 --> 00:26:15.814
floor.

00:26:15.814 --> 00:26:17.730
That way, as the net is
coming-- and then it's

00:26:17.730 --> 00:26:20.730
not being dragged
along the sea floor

00:26:20.730 --> 00:26:22.890
as they usually are-- the
cod and the yellow tail

00:26:22.890 --> 00:26:26.570
will dive down and haddock
will dive up and be caught.

00:26:26.570 --> 00:26:28.100
So you can catch them.

00:26:28.100 --> 00:26:29.760
And this is really
interesting where

00:26:29.760 --> 00:26:33.580
you can use gear technology
from an ecological perspective

00:26:33.580 --> 00:26:35.510
and from an economic
perspective.

00:26:35.510 --> 00:26:37.940
We want to target the haddock.

00:26:37.940 --> 00:26:39.490
There's also this
separator trawl

00:26:39.490 --> 00:26:41.640
which does essentially
the same thing.

00:26:41.640 --> 00:26:44.620
The cod and the yellow
tail flounder go down here

00:26:44.620 --> 00:26:46.714
and they go outside the net.

00:26:46.714 --> 00:26:48.380
Whereas the haddock,
they go up and they

00:26:48.380 --> 00:26:51.540
get into what we call the cod
end, the part of the net where

00:26:51.540 --> 00:26:53.160
they're caught.

00:26:53.160 --> 00:26:56.720
So I wanted to do an
analysis for the fishermen

00:26:56.720 --> 00:26:59.130
because they were
skeptical about changing

00:26:59.130 --> 00:27:00.380
their gear to the Rhule trawl.

00:27:00.380 --> 00:27:01.820
They didn't know how
it was going to work.

00:27:01.820 --> 00:27:03.194
They didn't know
if they're going

00:27:03.194 --> 00:27:04.890
to get their yields
and their money.

00:27:04.890 --> 00:27:08.340
So we put together the
biological data and the stock

00:27:08.340 --> 00:27:11.710
assessments we had
for all nine stocks

00:27:11.710 --> 00:27:14.520
that we have data
for in Georges Bank.

00:27:14.520 --> 00:27:21.270
And we have the profitability
surveys and the economic data

00:27:21.270 --> 00:27:25.180
from some of the
economists at NOAA.

00:27:25.180 --> 00:27:27.730
And we can show these
trade-offs, right?

00:27:27.730 --> 00:27:30.050
Because unless we have
the biological data

00:27:30.050 --> 00:27:34.620
and the employment data and
the economic data together,

00:27:34.620 --> 00:27:41.540
we can't coherently show
trade-offs to the policymakers.

00:27:41.540 --> 00:27:43.891
So here are the
three different lines

00:27:43.891 --> 00:27:45.140
of the three different trawls.

00:27:45.140 --> 00:27:47.700
I won't go into so many details
but the point of the matter

00:27:47.700 --> 00:27:51.430
is here, where you're getting
lots of yield and lots

00:27:51.430 --> 00:27:54.740
of producer surplus, which
is a proxy for profit,

00:27:54.740 --> 00:27:58.090
you have the trade-off of
the different other stocks.

00:27:58.090 --> 00:28:01.830
These are the mixed species of
the by-catch stocks going down.

00:28:01.830 --> 00:28:06.457
And so we can look at different
amount of days at sea.

00:28:06.457 --> 00:28:08.040
For example, we can
look at status quo

00:28:08.040 --> 00:28:11.260
and see the results
on the economic,

00:28:11.260 --> 00:28:14.270
the results on employment, and
the results to the ecosystem.

00:28:14.270 --> 00:28:17.800
This is just an example
of what could be done.

00:28:17.800 --> 00:28:21.340
I took this paper to the
Massachusetts State House

00:28:21.340 --> 00:28:24.066
in 2009 to State
Senator Bruce Tarr

00:28:24.066 --> 00:28:26.440
who said, oh, it's great that
you scientists are actually

00:28:26.440 --> 00:28:29.440
using those socioeconomic
assessments that NOAA always

00:28:29.440 --> 00:28:32.840
does but it's never combined
with the biological ones.

00:28:32.840 --> 00:28:37.330
So there's a little
bit of work there,

00:28:37.330 --> 00:28:39.190
but we can go a
little bit further.

00:28:39.190 --> 00:28:43.650
This is some work that I'm
in the process of where we're

00:28:43.650 --> 00:28:45.910
trying to look at
stakeholder conflicts

00:28:45.910 --> 00:28:50.670
because a large
amount of stakeholders

00:28:50.670 --> 00:28:53.120
are interested in fisheries.

00:28:53.120 --> 00:28:55.360
And how do we find the
management strategy

00:28:55.360 --> 00:28:58.470
that is going to satisfy the
most amount of stakeholders?

00:28:58.470 --> 00:29:00.880
That's a very, very
interesting question.

00:29:00.880 --> 00:29:04.570
Very little work is done that
usually quantifies utility

00:29:04.570 --> 00:29:07.520
functions for stakeholders
for [INAUDIBLE] so this

00:29:07.520 --> 00:29:10.730
is some work that
we've pioneered.

00:29:10.730 --> 00:29:13.260
These are examples
of stakeholders.

00:29:13.260 --> 00:29:16.120
Up here, you have your
industrial fisherman.

00:29:16.120 --> 00:29:18.890
You have two different
representatives of society.

00:29:18.890 --> 00:29:20.520
This is from a
Norwegian context where

00:29:20.520 --> 00:29:22.520
we have the Norwegian
fisheries minister who

00:29:22.520 --> 00:29:24.430
was from the right
party, who wanted

00:29:24.430 --> 00:29:27.810
profitable fisheries,
big boats, kind

00:29:27.810 --> 00:29:32.250
of this profit-centered
rhetoric.

00:29:32.250 --> 00:29:35.230
And after him was the
first female fisheries

00:29:35.230 --> 00:29:36.240
minister in Norway.

00:29:36.240 --> 00:29:40.060
She was representing
a lot of minorities

00:29:40.060 --> 00:29:42.715
at the same time when she was
appointed fisheries minister

00:29:42.715 --> 00:29:43.590
from the Labor Party.

00:29:43.590 --> 00:29:46.170
She was not only the
first woman there.

00:29:46.170 --> 00:29:48.850
She was of Sami dissent,
from the Lapland country

00:29:48.850 --> 00:29:52.212
in the north of Norway
and she was pregnant.

00:29:52.212 --> 00:29:52.920
So that was cool.

00:29:52.920 --> 00:29:56.280
And her political philosophy
was that all of Norway,

00:29:56.280 --> 00:29:58.750
which has one of the largest
coastlines in the world,

00:29:58.750 --> 00:30:00.780
should be lit up with
fishing villages.

00:30:00.780 --> 00:30:04.660
We want to put an emphasis
on employing people,

00:30:04.660 --> 00:30:07.440
the cultural value of
fisheries and whatnot.

00:30:07.440 --> 00:30:09.250
And then you have
environmentalists

00:30:09.250 --> 00:30:13.230
like Maren Esmark
at WWF in Oslo who

00:30:13.230 --> 00:30:16.540
has different utility
coming out of the fishery.

00:30:16.540 --> 00:30:18.940
And then you have your
small-scale coastal fisherman,

00:30:18.940 --> 00:30:20.880
your artisanal fisherman.

00:30:20.880 --> 00:30:23.400
And what's coming
out of the fishery

00:30:23.400 --> 00:30:25.750
are what we call utility
components like yield,

00:30:25.750 --> 00:30:29.300
profit, employment at
sea, employment at shore,

00:30:29.300 --> 00:30:33.890
and ecosystem preservation
also has value coming out

00:30:33.890 --> 00:30:35.160
of the fishery.

00:30:35.160 --> 00:30:39.360
And, basically, you can
make a utility function

00:30:39.360 --> 00:30:42.030
on how strong are
the preferences

00:30:42.030 --> 00:30:44.780
for each stakeholder on
these different components

00:30:44.780 --> 00:30:46.370
that we can get out.

00:30:46.370 --> 00:30:48.430
And then you would
quantify what we

00:30:48.430 --> 00:30:51.720
call the area of
joint satisfaction.

00:30:51.720 --> 00:30:56.890
So let's say this
is a generic showing

00:30:56.890 --> 00:30:59.400
the results for stakeholder
A for different management

00:30:59.400 --> 00:31:00.040
strategies.

00:31:00.040 --> 00:31:02.750
And in this blue zone, they
would be getting, for example,

00:31:02.750 --> 00:31:06.340
90% of their maximum utility.

00:31:06.340 --> 00:31:08.367
So they're pretty
happy in that area.

00:31:08.367 --> 00:31:10.200
Stakeholder B would be
getting, for example,

00:31:10.200 --> 00:31:14.410
90% in this area and then
just simply overlap them

00:31:14.410 --> 00:31:18.820
and talk about an area of where
you can start the negotiations.

00:31:18.820 --> 00:31:23.480
So you are already starting
with some sort of a consensus.

00:31:23.480 --> 00:31:25.860
This is avoiding where
you're starting from scratch

00:31:25.860 --> 00:31:29.720
and people are just going
to butt heads and not agree.

00:31:29.720 --> 00:31:31.990
So this is what
we've quantified.

00:31:31.990 --> 00:31:34.840
We call it the assessment of
joint stakeholder satisfaction,

00:31:34.840 --> 00:31:39.830
where we combine the data from
the different data sources,

00:31:39.830 --> 00:31:43.440
from the biology and from the
employment and economic model.

00:31:43.440 --> 00:31:45.810
And then we integrate
utility components,

00:31:45.810 --> 00:31:48.130
get stakeholder
specific total utility,

00:31:48.130 --> 00:31:50.790
and then get what we call the
JSS, the Joint Stakeholder

00:31:50.790 --> 00:31:51.830
Satisfaction.

00:31:51.830 --> 00:31:54.290
This is not routinely done.

00:31:54.290 --> 00:31:56.490
This is important to realize
because we don't even

00:31:56.490 --> 00:31:59.810
do integrated assessments
on this scale.

00:31:59.810 --> 00:32:01.845
There's scientists
around the world that

00:32:01.845 --> 00:32:04.100
are getting their fingers
wet and starting to do it,

00:32:04.100 --> 00:32:10.900
but we definitely don't do it on
a large political scale, which

00:32:10.900 --> 00:32:12.220
is needed.

00:32:12.220 --> 00:32:15.870
This is the one result I'm
going to show you from this.

00:32:15.870 --> 00:32:18.580
We did this-- quantified it
for Barents Sea Capelin, which

00:32:18.580 --> 00:32:21.940
is a small pelagic
fish that's sold

00:32:21.940 --> 00:32:24.530
on the Japanese market
for human consumption.

00:32:24.530 --> 00:32:27.237
This is a schooling fish
and we did it for cod,

00:32:27.237 --> 00:32:29.820
North Atlantic cod, which is a
much bigger, longer-lived fish,

00:32:29.820 --> 00:32:32.700
to see if there
were differences.

00:32:32.700 --> 00:32:34.550
I'm going to break
it down because this

00:32:34.550 --> 00:32:36.590
is a pretty heavy figure.

00:32:36.590 --> 00:32:39.730
On the x-axis, we have
harvest proportion,

00:32:39.730 --> 00:32:43.540
from zero to almost
100 percent fishing.

00:32:43.540 --> 00:32:47.160
And now we're doing this in
a computer simulation model,

00:32:47.160 --> 00:32:52.760
so we can actually do all
parameter space and look at it.

00:32:52.760 --> 00:32:56.090
And on the y-axis, you have
the minimum size of capture.

00:32:56.090 --> 00:32:58.650
So you guys are probably
familiar that-- if you're

00:32:58.650 --> 00:33:01.340
recreational fishing
and your fish is smaller

00:33:01.340 --> 00:33:03.950
than the minimum size,
you have to throw it back.

00:33:03.950 --> 00:33:08.084
So now we're simulating minimum
size of the whole spectrum

00:33:08.084 --> 00:33:09.500
for capelin, which
only gets to be

00:33:09.500 --> 00:33:11.890
about 18 centimeters
and cod, which

00:33:11.890 --> 00:33:14.640
gets to be about this big.

00:33:14.640 --> 00:33:17.520
For each data point,
each combination

00:33:17.520 --> 00:33:19.150
of harvest proportion--
for example,

00:33:19.150 --> 00:33:22.990
say you have 20% harvest
proportion and two centimeters

00:33:22.990 --> 00:33:25.415
minimum size-- that
represents a strategy.

00:33:25.415 --> 00:33:27.790
So you would fish this amount,
and you wouldn't fish them

00:33:27.790 --> 00:33:29.020
until they're this big.

00:33:33.500 --> 00:33:35.960
For each of these
management strategies,

00:33:35.960 --> 00:33:40.110
all five stakeholders
have their utility value.

00:33:40.110 --> 00:33:42.140
How much utility from
their utility function

00:33:42.140 --> 00:33:44.690
are they getting
with that strategy?

00:33:44.690 --> 00:33:47.690
And now we are getting into
a little bit of philosophy.

00:33:47.690 --> 00:33:50.510
We're not going to plot all
five of those stakeholders

00:33:50.510 --> 00:33:54.310
because, if we follow the
maxi-min principle by John

00:33:54.310 --> 00:33:57.220
Rawls who was a famous 20th
century philosopher-- he said

00:33:57.220 --> 00:34:01.400
the measure of a society
is how they take care

00:34:01.400 --> 00:34:04.520
of the least-advantaged
citizen, right?

00:34:04.520 --> 00:34:07.340
Which is a really
nice philosophy.

00:34:07.340 --> 00:34:09.580
I think a lot of people
can agree on that.

00:34:09.580 --> 00:34:11.909
So in that case,
we have the results

00:34:11.909 --> 00:34:13.020
of the five stakeholders.

00:34:13.020 --> 00:34:16.912
We only plot the stakeholder
who does the worst.

00:34:16.912 --> 00:34:18.370
We assume that we
want to take care

00:34:18.370 --> 00:34:20.370
of that stakeholder
looking for the consensus.

00:34:22.885 --> 00:34:24.260
We're concerned
when everybody is

00:34:24.260 --> 00:34:27.060
happy, not just two or
three people or one person.

00:34:27.060 --> 00:34:31.590
So this star represents where
all the stakeholders receive

00:34:31.590 --> 00:34:39.010
their maximum utility based on
the weakest link, basically.

00:34:39.010 --> 00:34:43.590
Which shows that we're fishing
a lot but at very large sizes

00:34:43.590 --> 00:34:47.170
because these circles
represent the status quo.

00:34:47.170 --> 00:34:49.389
Where we manage
fisheries today for cod.

00:34:49.389 --> 00:34:53.310
We manage them around
38% harvest proportion,

00:34:53.310 --> 00:34:56.550
and the minimum size
is 45 centimeters.

00:34:56.550 --> 00:34:58.200
This is really interesting.

00:34:58.200 --> 00:35:00.240
It's hard to know
how much trust--

00:35:00.240 --> 00:35:02.930
I've done a lot of
uncertainty analyses on this.

00:35:02.930 --> 00:35:04.440
And we're still doing this.

00:35:04.440 --> 00:35:07.720
The fact of the matter is we
get very different results.

00:35:07.720 --> 00:35:10.050
The status quo
management is based

00:35:10.050 --> 00:35:12.590
on the biological assessment.

00:35:12.590 --> 00:35:16.250
This star is based on the
bio-socioeconomic assessment,

00:35:16.250 --> 00:35:19.810
including stakeholder value, so
what they value in the fishery.

00:35:19.810 --> 00:35:21.770
This is giving us
different results,

00:35:21.770 --> 00:35:25.520
which I think means that we
need to look closer at this

00:35:25.520 --> 00:35:28.230
because perhaps we're
not even managing to what

00:35:28.230 --> 00:35:30.660
the majority of
stakeholders actually want.

00:35:30.660 --> 00:35:31.160
Right?

00:35:31.160 --> 00:35:33.110
This is a post-normal question.

00:35:33.110 --> 00:35:36.890
We have to get people around
the table using the philosopher

00:35:36.890 --> 00:35:39.731
Mary Parker Follett, who is
my favorite philosopher-- you

00:35:39.731 --> 00:35:40.480
should Google her.

00:35:40.480 --> 00:35:44.820
She's really, really cool-
she was born and raised

00:35:44.820 --> 00:35:46.930
in Massachusetts
in the late 1800s

00:35:46.930 --> 00:35:50.290
and did a lot of political
management theory

00:35:50.290 --> 00:35:52.550
and how to resolve conflicts.

00:35:52.550 --> 00:35:54.820
She says that, unless you
have diverse stakeholders

00:35:54.820 --> 00:35:59.350
around the table and they get
to reevaluate their objectives--

00:35:59.350 --> 00:36:01.664
so you have one
iteration of stakeholders

00:36:01.664 --> 00:36:02.830
and they say what they want.

00:36:02.830 --> 00:36:05.210
And then you do
that again and again

00:36:05.210 --> 00:36:07.450
and again until
they can realize,

00:36:07.450 --> 00:36:10.020
where is the integrated
solution going to come from?

00:36:10.020 --> 00:36:11.640
It has to come from us.

00:36:11.640 --> 00:36:13.600
How is it going to get there?

00:36:13.600 --> 00:36:19.910
So this is all towards the area
of the focus imaginarius, where

00:36:19.910 --> 00:36:21.490
we want to be.

00:36:21.490 --> 00:36:23.960
We have to start making
small steps to get there.

00:36:28.130 --> 00:36:31.550
So that's some work
that I have done

00:36:31.550 --> 00:36:34.510
and, I want to put it
also in a little bit

00:36:34.510 --> 00:36:36.110
different perspective as well.

00:36:36.110 --> 00:36:40.740
Let me kind of sum up
before I go to the part

00:36:40.740 --> 00:36:43.640
where I show you
some cool data stuff.

00:36:43.640 --> 00:36:46.130
This is kind of part of
the Occupy Science movement

00:36:46.130 --> 00:36:49.210
because I find a lot of
the scientific ethos being

00:36:49.210 --> 00:36:50.590
very important here.

00:36:50.590 --> 00:36:53.090
So I'm a biologist
and I collect data,

00:36:53.090 --> 00:36:56.140
but I understand that the
employment data in the fishery

00:36:56.140 --> 00:36:57.370
is really quite important.

00:36:57.370 --> 00:36:59.590
I understand the power
of the policymakers

00:36:59.590 --> 00:37:02.150
to put forward science.

00:37:02.150 --> 00:37:08.360
So I want to put this forward
as, how can we save the Ocean?

00:37:08.360 --> 00:37:10.420
Unless we educate
our students to see

00:37:10.420 --> 00:37:14.880
the Whole, the Whole
with the big W,

00:37:14.880 --> 00:37:17.070
they'll never understand
how their discipline,

00:37:17.070 --> 00:37:20.490
how their knowledge fits
into the whole, right?

00:37:20.490 --> 00:37:22.360
So this is getting
a little bit back,

00:37:22.360 --> 00:37:25.034
bridging the gap that we got
from the French Revolution.

00:37:25.034 --> 00:37:26.950
It's very good to have
disciplined scientists.

00:37:26.950 --> 00:37:28.010
That's great.

00:37:28.010 --> 00:37:28.880
This is technology.

00:37:28.880 --> 00:37:30.190
This is advancement.

00:37:30.190 --> 00:37:34.430
But we can't do that to the
expense of the grand challenges

00:37:34.430 --> 00:37:39.040
that we have-- climate change,
renewable resource management.

00:37:39.040 --> 00:37:41.830
Once they understand how
they fit into the whole,

00:37:41.830 --> 00:37:43.900
you can have cooperation
among disciplines

00:37:43.900 --> 00:37:47.740
to understand the whole and then
to use the data in integrated

00:37:47.740 --> 00:37:50.680
platforms in an extended peer
community-- this is relating

00:37:50.680 --> 00:37:52.850
to post-normal
science-- to inform

00:37:52.850 --> 00:37:56.288
science-driven policy not
policy-driven science.

00:37:58.980 --> 00:38:01.680
Again, this is a little bit of
the Occupy Science movement,

00:38:01.680 --> 00:38:04.590
where you have to stand
up for what science can do

00:38:04.590 --> 00:38:08.270
and what it can't do and
actually look at that.

00:38:08.270 --> 00:38:08.770
OK.

00:38:08.770 --> 00:38:11.970
This is the last part where I
come with some brainstorming

00:38:11.970 --> 00:38:14.480
ideas that me and my
colleagues in Bergen--

00:38:14.480 --> 00:38:17.260
and actually I had
colleagues from all

00:38:17.260 --> 00:38:20.880
over the world that
had some ideas here.

00:38:20.880 --> 00:38:22.930
How could Google
help save the Ocean?

00:38:22.930 --> 00:38:26.140
What do we do with data now?

00:38:26.140 --> 00:38:31.360
This is the dnanexus.com project
that Google Ventures heavily

00:38:31.360 --> 00:38:32.050
invested in.

00:38:32.050 --> 00:38:36.100
This is really
quite fascinating.

00:38:36.100 --> 00:38:38.840
So this is basically
putting all the data

00:38:38.840 --> 00:38:41.640
that we have on DNA
sequencing up in the cloud

00:38:41.640 --> 00:38:44.900
so people can access it, look
for new clues in the DNA,

00:38:44.900 --> 00:38:48.140
look for new-- if you're looking
for personalized medicine,

00:38:48.140 --> 00:38:49.250
all this type of thing.

00:38:49.250 --> 00:38:51.070
Where you have all
these public databases

00:38:51.070 --> 00:38:55.680
of data going into
the DNA Nexus cloud.

00:38:55.680 --> 00:38:57.590
Their office is
in Mountain View,

00:38:57.590 --> 00:39:01.069
so there's probably some people
who have maybe heard of this.

00:39:01.069 --> 00:39:03.360
So basically you're putting
everything up in the cloud,

00:39:03.360 --> 00:39:06.070
and you can use your
research community,

00:39:06.070 --> 00:39:08.250
for example, your biologists,
your statisticians,

00:39:08.250 --> 00:39:12.380
other collaborators, to
combine all of this data,

00:39:12.380 --> 00:39:14.190
look at different
analyses and get results

00:39:14.190 --> 00:39:17.520
that you couldn't have gotten
otherwise through a network.

00:39:17.520 --> 00:39:20.630
It's fascinating.

00:39:20.630 --> 00:39:23.200
It's really easy to see
how you would apply this

00:39:23.200 --> 00:39:27.380
to fish and oceans because
we only have one Ocean.

00:39:27.380 --> 00:39:29.560
That's why I have
Ocean with a capital O.

00:39:29.560 --> 00:39:32.540
And so everything is
inherently interconnected.

00:39:32.540 --> 00:39:34.450
We must remember that.

00:39:34.450 --> 00:39:37.140
This is an example
I was referring

00:39:37.140 --> 00:39:40.490
to ICES, the
International Council

00:39:40.490 --> 00:39:41.860
for the Exploration of the Sea.

00:39:41.860 --> 00:39:44.930
There's over 1,600 scientists
that routinely, every year,

00:39:44.930 --> 00:39:46.380
meet in working groups.

00:39:46.380 --> 00:39:51.210
This is an overview of some
of the data that they have.

00:39:51.210 --> 00:39:56.440
For example, they have
almost 700,000 measurements

00:39:56.440 --> 00:40:01.190
from the biological
community over 34 years.

00:40:01.190 --> 00:40:05.130
You have from the-- sorry.

00:40:05.130 --> 00:40:10.100
From the oceanographic data,
you have 245 million data points

00:40:10.100 --> 00:40:11.590
over 122 years.

00:40:11.590 --> 00:40:16.460
So we collect a lot of data
that's all publicly available.

00:40:16.460 --> 00:40:19.230
WWF has been doing
something really interesting

00:40:19.230 --> 00:40:19.960
in the Arctic.

00:40:19.960 --> 00:40:22.600
So this is a map of the Arctic.

00:40:22.600 --> 00:40:25.530
So here's Greenland.

00:40:25.530 --> 00:40:31.260
This is the eastern
coast of North America.

00:40:31.260 --> 00:40:32.140
And here's Iceland.

00:40:32.140 --> 00:40:35.270
Here's some data that they have.

00:40:35.270 --> 00:40:39.250
For example, you click
on a fish that you want,

00:40:39.250 --> 00:40:40.910
and this data is
actually showing

00:40:40.910 --> 00:40:45.450
all species and the relative
probabilities of occurrence

00:40:45.450 --> 00:40:46.990
in these areas.

00:40:46.990 --> 00:40:48.730
And so you have a
lot of different data

00:40:48.730 --> 00:40:51.487
that's kind of
overlayered each other.

00:40:51.487 --> 00:40:52.195
It's interesting.

00:40:55.460 --> 00:41:00.280
It's, for me, kind of
a toy to look around.

00:41:00.280 --> 00:41:03.217
It's not very, very
scientific, especially when

00:41:03.217 --> 00:41:05.550
you're talking about relative
probabilities, blah, blah,

00:41:05.550 --> 00:41:06.140
blah.

00:41:06.140 --> 00:41:10.069
But you can do it during
different seasons and all

00:41:10.069 --> 00:41:10.610
these things.

00:41:10.610 --> 00:41:12.870
And you can get a picture
of the fish that you want.

00:41:12.870 --> 00:41:14.530
It's really cool,
and it's showing

00:41:14.530 --> 00:41:16.950
that, unless we can
start mapping the Arctic,

00:41:16.950 --> 00:41:18.860
we can't really divvy
it up politically.

00:41:18.860 --> 00:41:20.480
We can't really study it.

00:41:20.480 --> 00:41:22.760
It's become a very big
political issue, for example,

00:41:22.760 --> 00:41:27.290
between Canada, USA,
Norway, and Russia.

00:41:27.290 --> 00:41:29.410
Who is going to own
these shipping lanes that

00:41:29.410 --> 00:41:31.980
are freeing up with the ice?

00:41:31.980 --> 00:41:36.850
Here's a paper that my
colleague, Nils Olav Handegard,

00:41:36.850 --> 00:41:38.880
published a couple
years ago, talking

00:41:38.880 --> 00:41:41.880
about how we're collecting data.

00:41:41.880 --> 00:41:47.080
This is a really cool thing that
the technology is there now.

00:41:47.080 --> 00:41:50.310
When we're at sea-- this is
our research boat, GO Sars.

00:41:50.310 --> 00:41:53.390
It's the world's most
advanced research vessel

00:41:53.390 --> 00:41:55.610
at my Institute of Marine
Research in Norway.

00:41:55.610 --> 00:42:00.960
We can see below, using acoustic
methods, what fish are there.

00:42:00.960 --> 00:42:02.450
And we can sample them.

00:42:02.450 --> 00:42:04.790
So we can match up
our acoustic sampling

00:42:04.790 --> 00:42:07.230
with the actual sample.

00:42:07.230 --> 00:42:10.750
For example, we can put these
sounders on cruise ships.

00:42:10.750 --> 00:42:16.440
So whenever they're going back
and forth for wherever they're

00:42:16.440 --> 00:42:18.350
going around the
world they can also

00:42:18.350 --> 00:42:20.480
be picking up continuous data.

00:42:20.480 --> 00:42:24.240
But Nils Olav has pioneered--
we have these missiles that they

00:42:24.240 --> 00:42:28.140
have in California,
which is really cool.

00:42:28.140 --> 00:42:30.000
They cost a lot.

00:42:30.000 --> 00:42:32.500
They're multi-million
dollar little things,

00:42:32.500 --> 00:42:34.000
but you can shoot
them in the ocean,

00:42:34.000 --> 00:42:36.190
and they just are
collecting data all over.

00:42:36.190 --> 00:42:38.940
There's people that spend
their whole careers on this.

00:42:38.940 --> 00:42:41.170
I'm not doing it
that much justice.

00:42:41.170 --> 00:42:43.260
But one thing that
Nils Olav has done

00:42:43.260 --> 00:42:48.240
are these sounders that are in
the sea bed of the floor that

00:42:48.240 --> 00:42:53.370
are collecting data 24/7,
data like salinity, turbidity,

00:42:53.370 --> 00:42:57.440
but also fish acoustics,
what schools are passing,

00:42:57.440 --> 00:42:59.320
species identification.

00:42:59.320 --> 00:43:00.980
The thing that is
bad about the ships

00:43:00.980 --> 00:43:04.066
is that the fish avoid
the ship's, right?

00:43:04.066 --> 00:43:05.440
They don't want
to get near them.

00:43:05.440 --> 00:43:06.154
They're loud.

00:43:06.154 --> 00:43:08.570
They're clunky, and they know
they're going to get caught.

00:43:08.570 --> 00:43:12.910
Whereas if you have these
passive data collectors,

00:43:12.910 --> 00:43:16.890
this is a really
good way to do it.

00:43:16.890 --> 00:43:20.910
The problem being, once we get
this data, how do we share it?

00:43:20.910 --> 00:43:22.660
Where's a common platform?

00:43:22.660 --> 00:43:24.340
We're really going
at collecting data.

00:43:24.340 --> 00:43:29.160
We're really bad about
sharing it and knowing

00:43:29.160 --> 00:43:32.460
how do we integrate it.

00:43:32.460 --> 00:43:34.930
So the Norwegian public
has paid for this.

00:43:34.930 --> 00:43:37.250
Why should they share it
with the rest of the world.

00:43:37.250 --> 00:43:39.240
So that's what we're
really missing is

00:43:39.240 --> 00:43:44.110
a common platform and people
who understand these data

00:43:44.110 --> 00:43:45.620
platforms.

00:43:45.620 --> 00:43:50.620
This is the last data
thing I want to show you.

00:43:50.620 --> 00:43:51.850
This is really cool data.

00:43:51.850 --> 00:43:54.030
This is, again, coming from WWF.

00:43:54.030 --> 00:43:57.110
This is data coming from
a single bluefin tuna.

00:43:57.110 --> 00:44:01.240
Bluefin tuna is the iconic
species, for me, of the Ocean.

00:44:01.240 --> 00:44:03.190
It's my favorite fish.

00:44:03.190 --> 00:44:06.180
It spawns in the Mediterranean,
crosses the Atlantic

00:44:06.180 --> 00:44:07.810
to the Caribbean
to start feeding up

00:44:07.810 --> 00:44:10.080
the eastern seaboard,
crosses again,

00:44:10.080 --> 00:44:12.500
and it's now up in Norway again.

00:44:12.500 --> 00:44:15.270
It has been an endangered
species for a while.

00:44:15.270 --> 00:44:20.650
Now, it has rebounded, partly
because of political measures,

00:44:20.650 --> 00:44:21.360
finally.

00:44:21.360 --> 00:44:23.530
They have stopped a
lot of the overfishing.

00:44:23.530 --> 00:44:25.630
So pretty soon it
might be OK again

00:44:25.630 --> 00:44:28.890
to eat bluefin tuna,
which is really cool.

00:44:28.890 --> 00:44:31.720
Anyway, bluefin tuna
is a fantastic swimmer.

00:44:31.720 --> 00:44:34.020
This is where they tagged--
so you can tag them.

00:44:34.020 --> 00:44:38.030
You can shoot a little
tag in its back.

00:44:38.030 --> 00:44:42.690
Kind of like I guess in Jaws
where they shoot a harpoon,

00:44:42.690 --> 00:44:44.880
but this is-- you just
shoot it like a dart.

00:44:44.880 --> 00:44:46.610
And this is in
the Mediterranean,

00:44:46.610 --> 00:44:50.300
Palma de Mallorca, off
the coast of Spain.

00:44:50.300 --> 00:44:52.250
And you start getting
all these pings

00:44:52.250 --> 00:44:53.910
about where it's actually going.

00:44:53.910 --> 00:44:56.350
And this red spot is
where it popped off.

00:44:56.350 --> 00:45:01.260
So this was data from, I
think, seven or eight days.

00:45:01.260 --> 00:45:02.620
And you can do this.

00:45:02.620 --> 00:45:04.910
There's all these
other cool things

00:45:04.910 --> 00:45:10.360
that you can do with the
data, the crux of it being,

00:45:10.360 --> 00:45:11.970
OK, where do we put the data?

00:45:11.970 --> 00:45:12.990
How do we access it?

00:45:12.990 --> 00:45:15.490
How do we make sure the right
people get access to this data

00:45:15.490 --> 00:45:19.520
to actually do something
meaningful with it?

00:45:19.520 --> 00:45:21.820
So if we go back
to our issue, how

00:45:21.820 --> 00:45:23.960
can we sustainably
manage the Ocean?

00:45:23.960 --> 00:45:28.150
I put forward the power of
data and the power of getting

00:45:28.150 --> 00:45:31.260
an extended peer community
around the table to not just

00:45:31.260 --> 00:45:33.690
talk about data but also
to talk about values

00:45:33.690 --> 00:45:36.050
because there's a difference
between science for science

00:45:36.050 --> 00:45:39.950
and science for policy,
occupying science so we know

00:45:39.950 --> 00:45:44.130
what science can actually
give us and what it can't.

00:45:44.130 --> 00:45:47.240
And I would open up
the floor if anybody

00:45:47.240 --> 00:45:48.760
has any questions or comments.

00:45:48.760 --> 00:45:51.510
And looking forward to
hearing what you think.

00:45:51.510 --> 00:45:53.030
Thanks a lot.

00:45:53.030 --> 00:45:54.990
[APPLAUSE]

00:46:00.387 --> 00:46:01.845
Is there anything
that was unclear?

00:46:01.845 --> 00:46:04.120
I could reiterate.

00:46:06.594 --> 00:46:08.344
AUDIENCE: I have a
question about that one

00:46:08.344 --> 00:46:11.575
chart that you showed with the
cod and another kind of fish

00:46:11.575 --> 00:46:13.563
and you had the
star and the circle.

00:46:13.563 --> 00:46:16.550
The circle was what
the current fishing is

00:46:16.550 --> 00:46:19.196
and the star-- that
was to represent

00:46:19.196 --> 00:46:21.656
what would satisfy
all stakeholders?

00:46:21.656 --> 00:46:23.624
And one thing I
didn't understand--

00:46:23.624 --> 00:46:28.399
so it was looking for basically
harvesting bigger fish.

00:46:28.399 --> 00:46:29.774
And I didn't quite
understand how

00:46:29.774 --> 00:46:31.520
that would satisfy
more stakeholders.

00:46:31.520 --> 00:46:34.860
DOROTHY DANKEL: Yeah, that
satisfies most stakeholders

00:46:34.860 --> 00:46:39.130
because the bigger the fish,
the more profit you receive.

00:46:39.130 --> 00:46:42.710
The bigger the fish,
the more you're

00:46:42.710 --> 00:46:45.410
waiting to fish
until they get big,

00:46:45.410 --> 00:46:48.417
which is preserving
the ecosystem.

00:46:48.417 --> 00:46:49.958
AUDIENCE: Does that
satisfy fishermen

00:46:49.958 --> 00:46:52.480
because that [INAUDIBLE]
means they would have to fish

00:46:52.480 --> 00:46:55.110
less now to wait for
these fish to get bigger.

00:46:55.110 --> 00:46:57.897
DOROTHY DANKEL: So there's a
different temporal time scales

00:46:57.897 --> 00:46:59.480
here, and there's
also the investment.

00:46:59.480 --> 00:47:01.590
So they've made
major investments

00:47:01.590 --> 00:47:05.350
to fish them at the current
size because to buy new nets

00:47:05.350 --> 00:47:08.870
and to change the net size
is a very large investment.

00:47:08.870 --> 00:47:11.700
So that shows that, in
this idealized world where

00:47:11.700 --> 00:47:14.279
they put preference on
profit, a little bit more

00:47:14.279 --> 00:47:16.320
in the industrial fishermen,
putting a little bit

00:47:16.320 --> 00:47:19.880
more preference on profit
than yield because there's

00:47:19.880 --> 00:47:21.897
a difference between
profit and catch.

00:47:21.897 --> 00:47:23.355
Because you can
get a lot of catch,

00:47:23.355 --> 00:47:26.940
but you could have used almost
all your resources to catch

00:47:26.940 --> 00:47:27.690
that catch.

00:47:27.690 --> 00:47:29.510
And the selling
price will be lower

00:47:29.510 --> 00:47:31.010
than what you actually put in.

00:47:31.010 --> 00:47:33.665
So if you focus on
profit, usually you

00:47:33.665 --> 00:47:37.030
have maximum profit before
you have maximum yield.

00:47:37.030 --> 00:47:40.520
So then if you focus on profit,
you're focusing on size.

00:47:44.330 --> 00:47:47.220
Especially if you talk about
tuna on the Japanese market,

00:47:47.220 --> 00:47:49.910
a bluefin tuna like this
is not worth anything.

00:47:49.910 --> 00:47:54.410
A bluefin tuna that's two meters
long could be worth $1 million.

00:47:54.410 --> 00:47:57.900
So there's a lot
of these dynamics

00:47:57.900 --> 00:48:00.000
that, until you start
modeling it and looking

00:48:00.000 --> 00:48:01.070
at the trade-offs,
you don't really

00:48:01.070 --> 00:48:02.500
understand behavioral patterns.

00:48:02.500 --> 00:48:06.322
But if they put their
behavior and they want profit,

00:48:06.322 --> 00:48:08.405
you get different results
than if they want yield.

00:48:13.067 --> 00:48:14.400
It's different for each fishery.

00:48:14.400 --> 00:48:16.890
But in this case,
that was the case.

00:48:16.890 --> 00:48:17.686
Yeah?

00:48:17.686 --> 00:48:20.066
AUDIENCE: Did say something
about the difference

00:48:20.066 --> 00:48:22.684
between going around
and figuring out

00:48:22.684 --> 00:48:26.440
what everyone's interests are
and then doing all of this work

00:48:26.440 --> 00:48:29.880
to figure out what would be the
best thing versus getting them

00:48:29.880 --> 00:48:33.952
together to listen to each other
and figuring it out together?

00:48:33.952 --> 00:48:35.910
DOROTHY DANKEL: Yeah,
there's a big difference.

00:48:35.910 --> 00:48:39.560
So the philosopher I
mentioned, Mary Parker Follett,

00:48:39.560 --> 00:48:41.800
who I just think
is cool, she says

00:48:41.800 --> 00:48:46.460
that there's very different
psychological behaviors that

00:48:46.460 --> 00:48:47.190
are going on.

00:48:47.190 --> 00:48:50.750
If I'm a scientist, if I go to
everybody's office by myself

00:48:50.750 --> 00:48:52.000
and say, OK, what do you want?

00:48:52.000 --> 00:48:52.930
Fill out this questionnaire?

00:48:52.930 --> 00:48:54.200
What do you want in the fishery?

00:48:54.200 --> 00:48:55.790
And I go to 20
different stakeholders

00:48:55.790 --> 00:48:59.740
and do that, combine that,
then I do the simulations,

00:48:59.740 --> 00:49:01.730
and I say, OK, this is
what you guys wanted.

00:49:01.730 --> 00:49:02.910
They see the results.

00:49:02.910 --> 00:49:06.840
They might say, eh, no I
didn't really mean that.

00:49:06.840 --> 00:49:08.940
In climate change
science, there's

00:49:08.940 --> 00:49:13.780
a big difference between the
preferences that they state,

00:49:13.780 --> 00:49:17.240
their stated preferences and
their revealed preferences.

00:49:17.240 --> 00:49:20.190
So I might say that I'm all
for helping climate change,

00:49:20.190 --> 00:49:23.510
but at the end of the day,
I'm still buying my tickets

00:49:23.510 --> 00:49:26.580
to San Francisco for
a three-day vacation

00:49:26.580 --> 00:49:29.540
because my revealed
preference is actually

00:49:29.540 --> 00:49:31.240
different than what I state.

00:49:31.240 --> 00:49:34.370
So it's important, she says,
to get people around the table

00:49:34.370 --> 00:49:37.060
and give them a chance to
reevaluate their positions

00:49:37.060 --> 00:49:39.770
according to the
positions of other people.

00:49:39.770 --> 00:49:41.600
So you get different
fishermen and say, OK,

00:49:41.600 --> 00:49:43.140
what do you want
out of the fishery?

00:49:43.140 --> 00:49:45.540
He says, I want to
catch a lot of fish.

00:49:45.540 --> 00:49:47.800
The next fisherman,
you ask him, he says,

00:49:47.800 --> 00:49:49.870
I want a 10% profit margin.

00:49:49.870 --> 00:49:53.320
And then the guy next to him
is like, oh, that sounds good.

00:49:53.320 --> 00:49:55.070
I think I want that too.

00:49:55.070 --> 00:49:55.635
Right?

00:49:55.635 --> 00:49:57.260
And then he's like,
so, as a scientist,

00:49:57.260 --> 00:49:59.210
what's the difference
between maximum yield

00:49:59.210 --> 00:50:01.580
and 10% profit
margin in my fishery?

00:50:01.580 --> 00:50:03.620
And I say actually
you would catch less.

00:50:03.620 --> 00:50:04.930
You would have more vacation.

00:50:04.930 --> 00:50:06.250
You would have more money.

00:50:06.250 --> 00:50:08.690
And then, all of a sudden, if
he had not been in the room

00:50:08.690 --> 00:50:10.770
when the other people
stated their preferences,

00:50:10.770 --> 00:50:12.810
he wouldn't see
different options.

00:50:12.810 --> 00:50:15.470
And you can't look for
integrated solutions

00:50:15.470 --> 00:50:19.390
unless those people are
there at the same time.

00:50:19.390 --> 00:50:21.310
AUDIENCE: So how do
you get them together?

00:50:21.310 --> 00:50:24.390
DOROTHY DANKEL: You get them
together through, for example,

00:50:24.390 --> 00:50:25.350
research projects.

00:50:25.350 --> 00:50:27.250
We have research
projects where we

00:50:27.250 --> 00:50:29.350
have stakeholder
consultation and stakeholder

00:50:29.350 --> 00:50:32.320
workshop, stakeholder
framing meetings.

00:50:32.320 --> 00:50:35.764
This has become really a la
mode in Europe at the moment.

00:50:35.764 --> 00:50:37.180
So I have a lot
of colleagues that

00:50:37.180 --> 00:50:40.680
get-- the European Commission is
paying for this type of science

00:50:40.680 --> 00:50:41.780
to be done.

00:50:41.780 --> 00:50:45.670
We still have to make the
bridge to actual politics

00:50:45.670 --> 00:50:51.080
and actual decision-making based
on these type of workshops.

00:50:51.080 --> 00:50:53.280
We're not there yet because
at the end of the day,

00:50:53.280 --> 00:50:55.380
it's still some
people in Brussels

00:50:55.380 --> 00:50:57.550
who are going to decide
what the fishing quota is

00:50:57.550 --> 00:50:59.700
and they do this
behind closed doors.

00:50:59.700 --> 00:51:04.290
So we have to get the show,
the methodology, in practice

00:51:04.290 --> 00:51:07.350
and really push hard for that.

00:51:07.350 --> 00:51:10.082
That's, I think, the
way you have to go.

00:51:10.082 --> 00:51:13.526
AUDIENCE: So how do you weight
stakeholders, some of whom

00:51:13.526 --> 00:51:15.494
are more important that others?

00:51:15.494 --> 00:51:18.446
The recreational fishermen
or the [INAUDIBLE].

00:51:27.310 --> 00:51:29.690
DOROTHY DANKEL: Yeah, so
this is a big question.

00:51:29.690 --> 00:51:31.150
This is where you go.

00:51:31.150 --> 00:51:33.495
I mean, this is a question
for political science,

00:51:33.495 --> 00:51:35.120
for anthropologists,
social scientists,

00:51:35.120 --> 00:51:37.770
who gets to sit at
the table, right?

00:51:37.770 --> 00:51:40.890
Because that's a big
commitment to sit at the table

00:51:40.890 --> 00:51:42.460
because if it's an
iterative process,

00:51:42.460 --> 00:51:46.240
you have to have the funds
to actually be there.

00:51:46.240 --> 00:51:49.480
You have to have knowledge
to actually participate.

00:51:49.480 --> 00:51:52.960
And it's a time and an
economic commitment.

00:51:52.960 --> 00:51:54.087
There's not one answer.

00:51:54.087 --> 00:51:55.170
It depends on the fishery.

00:51:55.170 --> 00:51:58.120
And, again, this is
a political question.

00:51:58.120 --> 00:51:58.920
Science can help.

00:51:58.920 --> 00:52:01.880
So science can, for
example-- social scientists

00:52:01.880 --> 00:52:04.350
can say who the main players
have been the last 10

00:52:04.350 --> 00:52:07.320
years based on their attendance
at different meetings,

00:52:07.320 --> 00:52:09.920
their profits coming from the
fishery, how many people they

00:52:09.920 --> 00:52:12.310
employee in the fishery,
and these types of things.

00:52:12.310 --> 00:52:17.030
But usually what's
done in Europe--

00:52:17.030 --> 00:52:18.790
we have the regional
advisory counsels,

00:52:18.790 --> 00:52:20.456
which is the meeting
of the stakeholders

00:52:20.456 --> 00:52:22.040
for the different
regions of Europe.

00:52:22.040 --> 00:52:25.580
They are I sign
up, and what we see

00:52:25.580 --> 00:52:28.370
is there's an overflow
of industrial fishermen

00:52:28.370 --> 00:52:31.530
and fisherman representatives
and not very many

00:52:31.530 --> 00:52:34.340
conservationists because
they're spread thin.

00:52:34.340 --> 00:52:36.320
They can't send
somebody to Copenhagen

00:52:36.320 --> 00:52:38.290
every six weeks to
have the meeting.

00:52:38.290 --> 00:52:43.460
So you don't see a
real democracy there.

00:52:43.460 --> 00:52:45.220
It's still the
people with the money

00:52:45.220 --> 00:52:47.440
who are participating
in the stakeholder.

00:52:47.440 --> 00:52:50.150
So that's a question
for democracy

00:52:50.150 --> 00:52:52.230
actually, as it should be.

00:52:55.209 --> 00:52:55.709
Yeah?

00:52:55.709 --> 00:52:57.530
AUDIENCE: So in
that chart that you

00:52:57.530 --> 00:53:02.170
showed where the star was
on the optimal fishing.

00:53:02.170 --> 00:53:05.152
That was 100% take
at a certain size.

00:53:05.152 --> 00:53:07.882
Is that in any way practical?

00:53:07.882 --> 00:53:09.340
DOROTHY DANKEL:
It's not quite 100%

00:53:09.340 --> 00:53:17.020
because-- the practicalities are
really disputable about that.

00:53:17.020 --> 00:53:20.050
It depends on the fishery.

00:53:20.050 --> 00:53:22.560
First of all, it
would take-- this

00:53:22.560 --> 00:53:24.910
is when you talk
about paradigm change.

00:53:24.910 --> 00:53:27.850
For the fishermen to wait until
the cod is this big to catch,

00:53:27.850 --> 00:53:30.730
it's not even on
the radar, right?

00:53:30.730 --> 00:53:33.980
They mature when
they're about this big.

00:53:33.980 --> 00:53:38.310
Science has shown that there's
tendencies for-- we're actually

00:53:38.310 --> 00:53:40.440
seeing the fish evolve
in front of our eyes.

00:53:40.440 --> 00:53:43.260
In the last 40
years, cod has been

00:53:43.260 --> 00:53:44.910
maturing at nine years of age.

00:53:44.910 --> 00:53:46.680
And now, because the
fishing mortality

00:53:46.680 --> 00:53:49.370
is many more times
the natural mortality,

00:53:49.370 --> 00:53:53.110
they're spawning
sooner because they

00:53:53.110 --> 00:53:54.720
know that they're
going to get caught.

00:53:54.720 --> 00:53:58.190
So now they're
spawning at five, six.

00:53:58.190 --> 00:53:59.200
So they're shrinking.

00:53:59.200 --> 00:54:00.570
It's a shrinking fish.

00:54:00.570 --> 00:54:02.330
This has ethical
considerations too

00:54:02.330 --> 00:54:07.230
because we're changing their
biology because of the fishing

00:54:07.230 --> 00:54:07.730
pressure.

00:54:07.730 --> 00:54:09.550
So it's not really on
the fishermen's radar

00:54:09.550 --> 00:54:13.790
to wait until they're this
big, even though, ecologically,

00:54:13.790 --> 00:54:16.570
and from a profit
standpoint, it could-- so,

00:54:16.570 --> 00:54:18.660
I mean, the practicalities
are up to debate.

00:54:18.660 --> 00:54:21.824
I presented this to
200 Norwegian fisherman

00:54:21.824 --> 00:54:24.970
and it wasn't
really on the radar.

00:54:24.970 --> 00:54:26.630
They understand the concept.

00:54:26.630 --> 00:54:28.980
And, again, that result.

00:54:28.980 --> 00:54:33.300
I don't put much trust
in that result, per se.

00:54:33.300 --> 00:54:38.060
We would have to do many more
different types of analysis

00:54:38.060 --> 00:54:41.160
to get some real
certainty of that, OK,

00:54:41.160 --> 00:54:44.060
can we trust this
somewhat or not.

00:54:44.060 --> 00:54:46.296
The fact of the matter is
that we have all the data.

00:54:46.296 --> 00:54:47.920
We just have to do
it, and this is just

00:54:47.920 --> 00:54:50.910
showing an outline of how you
can incorporate stakeholder

00:54:50.910 --> 00:54:53.280
utility functions and
look for strategies

00:54:53.280 --> 00:54:55.950
that satisfy as many people.

00:54:55.950 --> 00:54:59.810
So the practicalities
are up to the fishermen

00:54:59.810 --> 00:55:02.060
and what they're
willing to change

00:55:02.060 --> 00:55:04.430
and policymakers because,
at the end of the day,

00:55:04.430 --> 00:55:06.920
they have to put
objectives on the table.

00:55:06.920 --> 00:55:08.690
What are they actually
trying to achieve

00:55:08.690 --> 00:55:12.290
if they're going for
profitability, then,

00:55:12.290 --> 00:55:15.330
OK, we can show those trade-offs
for the other systems.

00:55:15.330 --> 00:55:18.430
But having a framework
where you can

00:55:18.430 --> 00:55:20.510
show trade-offs is
of utmost importance

00:55:20.510 --> 00:55:23.420
because that's what you have
to do, at the end of the day,

00:55:23.420 --> 00:55:26.200
is to make some decisions.

00:55:26.200 --> 00:55:27.990
Thanks a lot for having me.

00:55:27.990 --> 00:55:30.402
