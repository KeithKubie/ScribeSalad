would walk through the unit and she
 

00:02:12.980 --> 00:02:15.220
would walk through the unit and she
would notice when babies didn't kind of

00:02:15.220 --> 00:02:15.230
would notice when babies didn't kind of
 

00:02:15.230 --> 00:02:16.960

00:02:16.970 --> 00:02:18.430
match that picture in her brain
right and they would match they would

00:02:18.430 --> 00:02:18.440
right and they would match they would
 

00:02:18.440 --> 00:02:20.230

try and figure out what's going on like

00:02:33.520 --> 00:02:33.530
try and figure out what's going on like

00:03:28.070 --> 00:03:29.830
their head and so as a result their
attention is grabbed by it and they

00:03:29.830 --> 00:03:29.840
attention is grabbed by it and they
 

00:03:29.840 --> 00:03:31.540
attention is grabbed by it and they
start saying to themselves why why is

00:03:31.540 --> 00:03:31.550

why is its temperature off just a few

00:03:35.320 --> 00:03:35.330
why is its temperature off just a few
 

00:03:35.330 --> 00:03:38.650
why is its temperature off just a few
degrees and in this case they discovered

00:03:38.650 --> 00:03:38.660
degrees and in this case they discovered
 

00:03:38.660 --> 00:03:41.110
degrees and in this case they discovered
that the baby was incredibly sick now

00:03:41.110 --> 00:03:41.120
that the baby was incredibly sick now
 

00:03:41.120 --> 00:03:42.940

half an hour 45 minutes more the baby
actually probably would have passed away

00:03:48.699 --> 00:03:48.709
