00:03:42.470 --> 00:03:42.480
conversation with Jerry Cohen who was
 

00:03:42.480 --> 00:03:43.789
conversation with Jerry Cohen who was
the president of the University at that

00:03:43.789 --> 00:03:43.799
the president of the University at that
 

00:03:43.799 --> 00:03:46.789
the president of the University at that
time and over the course of a glass of

00:03:46.789 --> 00:03:46.799
time and over the course of a glass of
 

00:03:46.799 --> 00:03:48.590
time and over the course of a glass of
wine with Jerry one evening we we posed

00:03:48.590 --> 00:03:48.600
wine with Jerry one evening we we posed
 

00:03:48.600 --> 00:03:52.819
wine with Jerry one evening we we posed
this idea is there is there possibility

00:03:52.819 --> 00:03:52.829
this idea is there is there possibility
 

00:03:52.829 --> 00:03:54.710
this idea is there is there possibility
for an initiative that could pull these

00:03:54.710 --> 00:03:54.720
for an initiative that could pull these
 

00:03:54.720 --> 00:03:56.900
for an initiative that could pull these
assets together and the reason we call

00:03:56.900 --> 00:03:56.910
assets together and the reason we call
 

00:03:56.910 --> 00:03:59.120
assets together and the reason we call
Jerry was in doing our own background

00:03:59.120 --> 00:03:59.130
Jerry was in doing our own background
 

00:03:59.130 --> 00:04:01.340
Jerry was in doing our own background
research we realized that CMU had

00:04:01.340 --> 00:04:01.350
research we realized that CMU had
 

00:04:01.350 --> 00:04:03.080
research we realized that CMU had
everything that you needed to launch

00:04:03.080 --> 00:04:03.090
everything that you needed to launch
 

00:04:03.090 --> 00:04:07.039
everything that you needed to launch
this you had you had policy which we we

00:04:07.039 --> 00:04:07.049
this you had you had policy which we we
 

00:04:07.049 --> 00:04:08.539
this you had you had policy which we we
actually started with policy we didn't

00:04:08.539 --> 00:04:08.549
actually started with policy we didn't
 

00:04:08.549 --> 00:04:10.039
actually started with policy we didn't
start with the technology but when you

00:04:10.039 --> 00:04:10.049
start with the technology but when you
 

00:04:10.049 --> 00:04:12.500
start with the technology but when you
unpack the technology you were working

00:04:12.500 --> 00:04:12.510
unpack the technology you were working
 

00:04:12.510 --> 00:04:14.030
unpack the technology you were working
on automated vehicle so you had people

00:04:14.030 --> 00:04:14.040
on automated vehicle so you had people
 

00:04:14.040 --> 00:04:15.770
on automated vehicle so you had people
like Ross who had been at this for 20

00:04:15.770 --> 00:04:15.780
like Ross who had been at this for 20
 

00:04:15.780 --> 00:04:18.289
like Ross who had been at this for 20
years already you were in artificial

00:04:18.289 --> 00:04:18.299
years already you were in artificial
 

00:04:18.299 --> 00:04:19.879
years already you were in artificial
intelligence you had a strong

00:04:19.879 --> 00:04:19.889
intelligence you had a strong
 

00:04:19.889 --> 00:04:22.730
intelligence you had a strong
engineering department and you had this

00:04:22.730 --> 00:04:22.740
engineering department and you had this
 

00:04:22.740 --> 00:04:26.120
engineering department and you had this
cross departmental interdisciplinary way

00:04:26.120 --> 00:04:26.130
cross departmental interdisciplinary way
 

00:04:26.130 --> 00:04:27.450
cross departmental interdisciplinary way
of doing things and you

00:04:27.450 --> 00:04:27.460
of doing things and you
 

00:04:27.460 --> 00:04:29.129
of doing things and you
make stuff and you teach people how to

00:04:29.129 --> 00:04:29.139
make stuff and you teach people how to
 

00:04:29.139 --> 00:04:32.820
make stuff and you teach people how to
make stuff so I'm not gonna single you

00:04:32.820 --> 00:04:32.830
make stuff so I'm not gonna single you
 

00:04:32.830 --> 00:04:33.779

out Steve don't worry

00:04:33.779 --> 00:04:33.789
out Steve don't worry
 

00:04:33.789 --> 00:04:39.210

yeah so uh by combining these assets we

00:04:39.210 --> 00:04:39.220
yeah so uh by combining these assets we
 

00:04:39.220 --> 00:04:40.230
yeah so uh by combining these assets we
thought this is really a way to

00:04:40.230 --> 00:04:40.240
thought this is really a way to
 

00:04:40.240 --> 00:04:42.390
thought this is really a way to
distinguish this city this University

00:04:42.390 --> 00:04:42.400
distinguish this city this University
 

00:04:42.400 --> 00:04:43.920
distinguish this city this University
and a community of people who can come

00:04:43.920 --> 00:04:43.930
and a community of people who can come
 

00:04:43.930 --> 00:04:46.499
and a community of people who can come
together to solve real-world problems so

00:04:46.499 --> 00:04:46.509
together to solve real-world problems so
 

00:04:46.509 --> 00:04:48.960
together to solve real-world problems so
uh it wasn't very long that the jerod

00:04:48.960 --> 00:04:48.970
uh it wasn't very long that the jerod
 

00:04:48.970 --> 00:04:50.730
uh it wasn't very long that the jerod

person we would want to manage this
there was really one person we had in

00:05:33.839 --> 00:05:33.849
there was really one person we had in
 

00:05:33.849 --> 00:05:35.070
there was really one person we had in
mind he happened to be here at the

gonna humiliate Rick because he hates to

00:05:39.719 --> 00:05:39.729
gonna humiliate Rick because he hates to
 

00:05:39.729 --> 00:05:42.360

it really Rick was the person who put

00:05:44.129 --> 00:05:44.139
it really Rick was the person who put
 

00:05:44.139 --> 00:05:46.680

the the core thinking together behind

00:05:46.680 --> 00:05:46.690
the the core thinking together behind
 

00:05:46.690 --> 00:05:49.170
the the core thinking together behind
the strategy and how we could launch

00:05:49.170 --> 00:05:49.180
the strategy and how we could launch
 

00:05:49.180 --> 00:05:50.580
the strategy and how we could launch
something that was really just an

00:05:50.580 --> 00:05:50.590
something that was really just an
 

00:05:50.590 --> 00:05:52.200
something that was really just an
initiative and eventually became a

00:05:52.200 --> 00:05:52.210
initiative and eventually became a
 

00:05:52.210 --> 00:05:53.580
initiative and eventually became a
center and then a federally funded

00:05:53.580 --> 00:05:53.590
center and then a federally funded
 

00:05:53.590 --> 00:05:55.950
center and then a federally funded
center and now something much much more

00:05:55.950 --> 00:05:55.960
center and now something much much more
 

00:05:55.960 --> 00:05:58.409
center and now something much much more
comprehensive I do have to give Rick

00:05:58.409 --> 00:05:58.419
comprehensive I do have to give Rick
 

00:05:58.419 --> 00:05:59.909
comprehensive I do have to give Rick
McCullough credit though on that very

00:05:59.909 --> 00:05:59.919
McCullough credit though on that very
 

00:05:59.919 --> 00:06:01.499
McCullough credit though on that very
day that we were meeting the research

00:06:01.499 --> 00:06:01.509
day that we were meeting the research
 

00:06:01.509 --> 00:06:03.600
day that we were meeting the research
faculty Rick said you know I have this

00:06:03.600 --> 00:06:03.610
faculty Rick said you know I have this
 

00:06:03.610 --> 00:06:04.920
faculty Rick said you know I have this
vision that this can be bigger than

00:06:04.920 --> 00:06:04.930
vision that this can be bigger than
 

00:06:04.930 --> 00:06:07.499
vision that this can be bigger than
transportation this can be a much much

00:06:07.499 --> 00:06:07.509
transportation this can be a much much
 

00:06:07.509 --> 00:06:09.240
transportation this can be a much much
larger more comprehensive effort we

00:06:09.240 --> 00:06:09.250
larger more comprehensive effort we
 

00:06:09.250 --> 00:06:11.279
larger more comprehensive effort we
should be looking at city data and using

00:06:11.279 --> 00:06:11.289
should be looking at city data and using
 

00:06:11.289 --> 00:06:13.230
should be looking at city data and using
city data to solve lots of problems

00:06:13.230 --> 00:06:13.240
city data to solve lots of problems
 

00:06:13.240 --> 00:06:15.240
city data to solve lots of problems
beyond transportation we can apply this

00:06:15.240 --> 00:06:15.250
beyond transportation we can apply this
 

00:06:15.250 --> 00:06:17.189
beyond transportation we can apply this
to stormwater other areas of

00:06:17.189 --> 00:06:17.199
to stormwater other areas of
 

00:06:17.199 --> 00:06:18.899
to stormwater other areas of
infrastructure we can apply this to the

00:06:18.899 --> 00:06:18.909
infrastructure we can apply this to the
 

00:06:18.909 --> 00:06:20.670
infrastructure we can apply this to the
way we deliver human services he had a

00:06:20.670 --> 00:06:20.680
way we deliver human services he had a
 

00:06:20.680 --> 00:06:23.339
way we deliver human services he had a
big big picture in mind and I remember

00:06:23.339 --> 00:06:23.349
big big picture in mind and I remember
 

00:06:23.349 --> 00:06:26.070
big big picture in mind and I remember
saying specifically to Rick Henry just

00:06:26.070 --> 00:06:26.080
saying specifically to Rick Henry just
 

00:06:26.080 --> 00:06:28.140
saying specifically to Rick Henry just
wants to fix the signal it Forbes and

00:06:28.140 --> 00:06:28.150
wants to fix the signal it Forbes and
 

00:06:28.150 --> 00:06:30.570
wants to fix the signal it Forbes and
Moore would love to take on all these

00:06:30.570 --> 00:06:30.580
Moore would love to take on all these
 

00:06:30.580 --> 00:06:32.010
Moore would love to take on all these
other issues but let's get started and

00:06:32.010 --> 00:06:32.020
other issues but let's get started and
 

00:06:32.020 --> 00:06:32.850
other issues but let's get started and
we'll see where it goes

00:06:32.850 --> 00:06:32.860
we'll see where it goes
 

00:06:32.860 --> 00:06:35.339
we'll see where it goes
so it's it's just a way of saying when

00:06:35.339 --> 00:06:35.349
so it's it's just a way of saying when
 

00:06:35.349 --> 00:06:37.320
so it's it's just a way of saying when
you start something you don't quite know

00:06:37.320 --> 00:06:37.330
you start something you don't quite know
 

00:06:37.330 --> 00:06:38.700
you start something you don't quite know
where it's going to go and you have to

00:06:38.700 --> 00:06:38.710
where it's going to go and you have to
 

00:06:38.710 --> 00:06:40.320
where it's going to go and you have to
be open to to where

00:06:40.320 --> 00:06:40.330
be open to to where
 

00:06:40.330 --> 00:06:42.300
be open to to where
where it's gonna go but back to back to

00:06:42.300 --> 00:06:42.310
where it's gonna go but back to back to
 

00:06:42.310 --> 00:06:44.969
where it's gonna go but back to back to
the the point this was about Henry and

00:06:44.969 --> 00:06:44.979
the the point this was about Henry and
 

00:06:44.979 --> 00:06:47.969
the the point this was about Henry and
in the vision for I was supposed to be

00:06:47.969 --> 00:06:47.979
in the vision for I was supposed to be
 

00:06:47.979 --> 00:06:49.170
in the vision for I was supposed to be
about Henry in the vision that he had

00:06:49.170 --> 00:06:49.180
about Henry in the vision that he had
 

00:06:49.180 --> 00:06:50.459
about Henry in the vision that he had
for this so you need to know a few

00:06:50.459 --> 00:06:50.469
for this so you need to know a few
 

00:06:50.469 --> 00:06:51.929

carry this work on and traffic 21 was

00:07:45.180 --> 00:07:45.190
carry this work on and traffic 21 was
 

00:07:45.190 --> 00:07:46.830
carry this work on and traffic 21 was
really the test model for us it showed

00:07:46.830 --> 00:07:46.840
really the test model for us it showed
 

00:07:46.840 --> 00:07:49.409
really the test model for us it showed
us that we can take on large initiatives

00:07:49.409 --> 00:07:49.419
us that we can take on large initiatives
 

00:07:49.419 --> 00:07:51.510
us that we can take on large initiatives
we can help solve big problems we can

00:07:51.510 --> 00:07:51.520
we can help solve big problems we can
 

00:07:51.520 --> 00:07:53.249
we can help solve big problems we can
assemble talent we can put a consortium

00:07:53.249 --> 00:07:53.259
assemble talent we can put a consortium
 

00:07:53.259 --> 00:07:55.559
assemble talent we can put a consortium
together we can work with government we

00:07:55.559 --> 00:07:55.569
together we can work with government we
 

00:07:55.569 --> 00:07:57.029
together we can work with government we
can work with industry in ways that we

00:07:57.029 --> 00:07:57.039
can work with industry in ways that we
 

00:07:57.039 --> 00:07:59.579
can work with industry in ways that we
hadn't before so in many ways what we're

00:07:59.579 --> 00:07:59.589
hadn't before so in many ways what we're
 

00:07:59.589 --> 00:08:00.959
hadn't before so in many ways what we're
going to be doing with the Foundation's

00:08:00.959 --> 00:08:00.969
going to be doing with the Foundation's
 

00:08:00.969 --> 00:08:02.430
going to be doing with the Foundation's
going forward was shaped by this

00:08:02.430 --> 00:08:02.440
going forward was shaped by this
 

00:08:02.440 --> 00:08:04.469
going forward was shaped by this
experience with traffic 21 I have a

00:08:04.469 --> 00:08:04.479
experience with traffic 21 I have a
 

00:08:04.479 --> 00:08:05.899
experience with traffic 21 I have a
little bit more of it to Rick for that

00:08:05.899 --> 00:08:05.909
little bit more of it to Rick for that
 

00:08:05.909 --> 00:08:08.640
little bit more of it to Rick for that
but this was our chance to figure out

00:08:08.640 --> 00:08:08.650
but this was our chance to figure out
 

00:08:08.650 --> 00:08:09.990
but this was our chance to figure out
how we could play a bigger role in

00:08:09.990 --> 00:08:10.000
how we could play a bigger role in
 

00:08:10.000 --> 00:08:11.809
how we could play a bigger role in
Pittsburgh and in the world by

00:08:11.809 --> 00:08:11.819
Pittsburgh and in the world by
 

00:08:11.819 --> 00:08:14.640
Pittsburgh and in the world by
reorienting what we do every day and it

00:08:14.640 --> 00:08:14.650
reorienting what we do every day and it
 

00:08:14.650 --> 00:08:16.769
reorienting what we do every day and it
you know 80 years old Henry was already

00:08:16.769 --> 00:08:16.779
you know 80 years old Henry was already
 

00:08:16.779 --> 00:08:19.589
you know 80 years old Henry was already
open to that idea so another lesson from

00:08:19.589 --> 00:08:19.599
open to that idea so another lesson from
 

00:08:19.599 --> 00:08:21.390
open to that idea so another lesson from
Henry is don't get locked into things so

00:08:21.390 --> 00:08:21.400
Henry is don't get locked into things so
 

00:08:21.400 --> 00:08:22.860
Henry is don't get locked into things so
you should have a plan you should stay

00:08:22.860 --> 00:08:22.870
you should have a plan you should stay
 

00:08:22.870 --> 00:08:24.659
you should have a plan you should stay
on the plan you should try to execute on

00:08:24.659 --> 00:08:24.669
on the plan you should try to execute on
 

00:08:24.669 --> 00:08:26.100
on the plan you should try to execute on
it but you have to be able to iterate

00:08:26.100 --> 00:08:26.110
it but you have to be able to iterate
 

00:08:26.110 --> 00:08:27.629
it but you have to be able to iterate
and when the time comes to change you

00:08:27.629 --> 00:08:27.639
and when the time comes to change you
 

00:08:27.639 --> 00:08:29.010
and when the time comes to change you
have to be ready to change and move on

00:08:29.010 --> 00:08:29.020
have to be ready to change and move on
 

00:08:29.020 --> 00:08:30.749
have to be ready to change and move on
to the next thing and I think that's a

00:08:30.749 --> 00:08:30.759
to the next thing and I think that's a
 

00:08:30.759 --> 00:08:32.040
to the next thing and I think that's a
lesson that we've learned with with

00:08:32.040 --> 00:08:32.050
lesson that we've learned with with
 

00:08:32.050 --> 00:08:34.949
lesson that we've learned with with
traffic 21 start traffic 21 it's a small

00:08:34.949 --> 00:08:34.959
traffic 21 start traffic 21 it's a small
 

00:08:34.959 --> 00:08:37.019

initiative looks like a center there's

00:08:37.019 --> 00:08:37.029
initiative looks like a center there's
 

00:08:37.029 --> 00:08:38.639

this opportunity to become a university

00:08:38.639 --> 00:08:38.649
this opportunity to become a university
 

00:08:38.649 --> 00:08:41.310
this opportunity to become a university
transportation center USDOT said no

00:08:41.310 --> 00:08:41.320
transportation center USDOT said no
 

00:08:41.320 --> 00:08:43.769
transportation center USDOT said no
chance it happened within a year I think

00:08:43.769 --> 00:08:43.779
chance it happened within a year I think
 

00:08:43.779 --> 00:08:46.050
chance it happened within a year I think
was about a year the tea set is formed

00:08:46.050 --> 00:08:46.060
was about a year the tea set is formed
 

00:08:46.060 --> 00:08:47.970
was about a year the tea set is formed
be pretty soon the larger vision of

00:08:47.970 --> 00:08:47.980
be pretty soon the larger vision of

somewhere between nine and a half and

00:10:11.850 --> 00:10:11.860
somewhere between nine and a half and
 

00:10:11.860 --> 00:10:15.750
somewhere between nine and a half and
ten and a half which is correct right so

00:10:15.750 --> 00:10:15.760
ten and a half which is correct right so
 

00:10:15.760 --> 00:10:17.460
ten and a half which is correct right so
the point is that there are different

for the ability to work through these
issues the first answer was no the

00:10:43.140 --> 00:10:43.150
issues the first answer was no the
 

00:10:43.150 --> 00:10:44.490
issues the first answer was no the
second answer was well how would it work

00:10:44.490 --> 00:10:44.500
second answer was well how would it work
 

00:10:44.500 --> 00:10:46.440
second answer was well how would it work
and then it was no and then the third

00:10:46.440 --> 00:10:46.450
and then it was no and then the third
 

00:10:46.450 --> 00:10:48.630
and then it was no and then the third
answer was I think maybe no a third time

00:10:48.630 --> 00:10:48.640
answer was I think maybe no a third time
 

00:10:48.640 --> 00:10:50.190
answer was I think maybe no a third time
and then you work through it and

00:10:50.190 --> 00:10:50.200
and then you work through it and
 

00:10:50.200 --> 00:10:51.450
and then you work through it and
eventually things happen and you have a

00:10:51.450 --> 00:10:51.460
eventually things happen and you have a
 

00:10:51.460 --> 00:10:52.800
eventually things happen and you have a
pilot and it works and now you have a

00:10:52.800 --> 00:10:52.810
pilot and it works and now you have a
 

00:10:52.810 --> 00:10:54.840
pilot and it works and now you have a
company formed out of it so it's this

00:10:54.840 --> 00:10:54.850
company formed out of it so it's this
 

00:10:54.850 --> 00:10:56.520
company formed out of it so it's this
idea that you can keep iterating on

00:10:56.520 --> 00:10:56.530
idea that you can keep iterating on
 

00:10:56.530 --> 00:10:58.680
idea that you can keep iterating on
ideas you can't do it alone you have to

00:10:58.680 --> 00:10:58.690
ideas you can't do it alone you have to
 

00:10:58.690 --> 00:11:00.960
ideas you can't do it alone you have to
have this combination of these community

00:11:00.960 --> 00:11:00.970
