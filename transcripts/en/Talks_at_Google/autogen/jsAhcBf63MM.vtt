[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:00:07.245 --> 00:00:08.605
SPEAKER 1: Hi, everybody.

00:00:08.605 --> 00:00:12.020
Thank you for being
here with me today.

00:00:12.020 --> 00:00:15.950
I'm so pleased to be
here and have a chance

00:00:15.950 --> 00:00:22.370
to introduce our guest
speaker today, Mary Risley.

00:00:22.370 --> 00:00:25.250
She's the founder
of Food Runners.

00:00:25.250 --> 00:00:27.440
She has been one
of the proponents

00:00:27.440 --> 00:00:30.350
of this program for decades.

00:00:30.350 --> 00:00:34.310
And she's also just
a fascinating person.

00:00:34.310 --> 00:00:40.822
And please join me in
welcoming Mary Risley.

00:00:40.822 --> 00:00:41.780
MARY RISLEY: Thank you.

00:00:41.780 --> 00:00:44.155
[APPLAUSE]

00:00:47.490 --> 00:00:49.640
Hi, everybody.

00:00:49.640 --> 00:00:52.720
So let's see.

00:00:52.720 --> 00:00:54.930
What am I talking about today.

00:00:54.930 --> 00:00:59.900
So first of all, number one is
it's really good to see you,

00:00:59.900 --> 00:01:03.350
and I think the food here
is the best I've ever

00:01:03.350 --> 00:01:05.660
seen in a corporate cafeteria.

00:01:05.660 --> 00:01:07.670
It was fantastic.

00:01:07.670 --> 00:01:11.480
And thank you for
all the excess food

00:01:11.480 --> 00:01:13.280
that you give Food Runners.

00:01:13.280 --> 00:01:16.940
We are picking up
masses of food every day

00:01:16.940 --> 00:01:19.610
and taking it directly
to the shelters

00:01:19.610 --> 00:01:22.520
where it is either
served that night

00:01:22.520 --> 00:01:24.870
or chilled and
served the next day.

00:01:24.870 --> 00:01:27.560
So it really, really means
a lot to the shelters

00:01:27.560 --> 00:01:30.080
in San Francisco.

00:01:30.080 --> 00:01:31.700
What's the story
about Mary Risley.

00:01:31.700 --> 00:01:35.480
Mary Risley was
a young woman who

00:01:35.480 --> 00:01:39.800
drove across the Trans-Canada
Highway in a blue Mustang

00:01:39.800 --> 00:01:42.920
50 years ago and
came down to San

00:01:42.920 --> 00:01:46.940
Francisco in the Summer of Love
when everybody was sharing.

00:01:46.940 --> 00:01:50.600
They were sharing sex,
apartments, marijuana,

00:01:50.600 --> 00:01:57.240
and it was a major influence
to me, the Summer of Love.

00:01:57.240 --> 00:02:03.710
And by the way, I still
have the blue Mustang.

00:02:03.710 --> 00:02:07.070
And that was 50 years ago.

00:02:07.070 --> 00:02:11.660
I tried for five years
to be a secretary

00:02:11.660 --> 00:02:16.610
and wear pantyhose and go
up in a corporate office

00:02:16.610 --> 00:02:20.720
and try to get the men to
think they want to marry me,

00:02:20.720 --> 00:02:22.370
and none of it worked.

00:02:22.370 --> 00:02:25.610
And so after five
years, I said fuck this.

00:02:25.610 --> 00:02:28.200
And somebody said, what have
you always wanted to do.

00:02:28.200 --> 00:02:30.860
And I said, I've always wanted
to be a cooking teacher.

00:02:30.860 --> 00:02:34.910
So I started teaching cooking
in a ratty Leavenworth Street

00:02:34.910 --> 00:02:35.990
apartment.

00:02:35.990 --> 00:02:38.330
I handwrote the recipes.

00:02:38.330 --> 00:02:41.420
I walked down to a bank at
California in Montgomery.

00:02:41.420 --> 00:02:45.860
Somebody copied them on
a Xerox machine for free,

00:02:45.860 --> 00:02:47.630
and I went home and
taught everybody

00:02:47.630 --> 00:02:49.940
what I'd learned in
Mastering the Art of French

00:02:49.940 --> 00:02:51.680
Cooking" by Julia Child.

00:02:51.680 --> 00:02:53.510
So I am a big fraud.

00:02:53.510 --> 00:02:57.170
That was in 1973.

00:02:57.170 --> 00:03:02.780
And 1979, I started a full time
culinary school, Tante Marie's.

00:03:02.780 --> 00:03:11.030
And if you Google Mary
Risley, you will see my video.

00:03:11.030 --> 00:03:13.300
How many people have
already done that?

00:03:13.300 --> 00:03:16.090
[LAUGHTER]

00:03:16.590 --> 00:03:20.580
The video I made five years
ago, which is timely now,

00:03:20.580 --> 00:03:23.820
is just put the fucking
turkey in an oven,

00:03:23.820 --> 00:03:27.960
have a glass of wine, take a
walk, and don't worry about it.

00:03:27.960 --> 00:03:29.040
Thank you.

00:03:29.040 --> 00:03:30.420
Thank you, YouTube.

00:03:30.420 --> 00:03:33.530
Thank you, Google.

00:03:33.530 --> 00:03:41.280
So you go to
tantemarie.com, my website,

00:03:41.280 --> 00:03:44.310
you will see there
are 350 recipes

00:03:44.310 --> 00:03:48.174
on how to cook and 32 YouTube
videos on how to cook.

00:03:48.174 --> 00:03:49.590
And of course, now
I'm out of date

00:03:49.590 --> 00:03:52.440
because people are putting
videos on other things

00:03:52.440 --> 00:03:53.780
and things like that.

00:03:53.780 --> 00:03:57.570
But I'm a very
lucky girl that I've

00:03:57.570 --> 00:04:01.650
been able to support myself as a
cooking teacher for the last 45

00:04:01.650 --> 00:04:02.710
years.

00:04:02.710 --> 00:04:06.690
The next thing-- am I OK
in the picture up there?

00:04:06.690 --> 00:04:07.410
Do I look OK?

00:04:07.410 --> 00:04:09.678
Yes, I look skinny
and beautiful.

00:04:09.678 --> 00:04:11.430
[LAUGHTER]

00:04:13.740 --> 00:04:14.820
What is Food Runners?

00:04:14.820 --> 00:04:20.310
Food Runners was started in 1987
with me and a group of women.

00:04:20.310 --> 00:04:25.260
And what we do is we
provide any business

00:04:25.260 --> 00:04:29.080
in San Francisco with
the free service--

00:04:29.080 --> 00:04:35.190
hi-- free service of picking up
their leftover perishable and

00:04:35.190 --> 00:04:38.430
prepared foods and taking
it to the shelters,

00:04:38.430 --> 00:04:40.860
taking it to what I
call the shelters.

00:04:40.860 --> 00:04:43.900
It's really the neighborhood
feeding programs.

00:04:43.900 --> 00:04:50.910
And so what happens is
we have currently 200

00:04:50.910 --> 00:04:55.620
volunteers in their own
car, one paid truck driver--

00:04:55.620 --> 00:05:00.550
a man running around in a
van, his own van, who's paid--

00:05:00.550 --> 00:05:02.940
and two bike couriers.

00:05:02.940 --> 00:05:05.010
And what those
people are doing is

00:05:05.010 --> 00:05:08.700
picking up leftover
perishable and prepared foods

00:05:08.700 --> 00:05:12.570
and taking it right
from the donor

00:05:12.570 --> 00:05:17.910
to the people that are going to
serve it that night for dinner.

00:05:17.910 --> 00:05:24.180
We do have a slideshow to go
with a PowerPoint presentation.

00:05:24.180 --> 00:05:32.280
So if we have it up, we could
talk a little bit about my PP--

00:05:32.280 --> 00:05:36.750
it's called a PPP I understand,
a PowerPoint presentation.

00:05:36.750 --> 00:05:39.315
No idea how to use
something like that myself.

00:05:44.010 --> 00:05:47.700
A little bit earlier, I
talked about my coming

00:05:47.700 --> 00:05:50.880
to San Francisco 50 years
in the Summer of Love,

00:05:50.880 --> 00:05:54.990
and that was a time when
people were sharing.

00:05:54.990 --> 00:05:58.920
It was also a time when it was
cheap to live in San Francisco,

00:05:58.920 --> 00:06:01.570
if you can believe that.

00:06:01.570 --> 00:06:06.240
And so what we do is
we provide businesses

00:06:06.240 --> 00:06:09.510
in San Francisco with this
free service of picking up

00:06:09.510 --> 00:06:12.360
their leftover food.

00:06:12.360 --> 00:06:15.210
You might have heard of the
San Francisco food bank.

00:06:15.210 --> 00:06:18.660
The food bank is a
huge building down

00:06:18.660 --> 00:06:21.600
in Indiana Street,
which is a warehouse

00:06:21.600 --> 00:06:23.850
of nonperishable foods.

00:06:27.480 --> 00:06:33.150
People like Kellogg's
and Del Monte

00:06:33.150 --> 00:06:40.380
can donate green beans that
have that wrong label on them

00:06:40.380 --> 00:06:41.970
or cereals or stuff like that.

00:06:44.490 --> 00:06:49.230
Food Runners takes to over 300
different neighborhood feeding

00:06:49.230 --> 00:06:53.370
programs, but those programs
can go to the San Francisco food

00:06:53.370 --> 00:06:57.540
bank and buy food
like in a shopping

00:06:57.540 --> 00:06:59.980
cart for $0.18 a pound.

00:06:59.980 --> 00:07:00.930
It's donated food.

00:07:00.930 --> 00:07:06.990
The $0.18 goes to pay
for the operating costs.

00:07:06.990 --> 00:07:11.790
But what do you do with
the trays of lentils

00:07:11.790 --> 00:07:17.070
with mushrooms, that dairies
of noodles with pork?

00:07:17.070 --> 00:07:21.300
That can't go to a big warehouse
down on Indiana Street.

00:07:21.300 --> 00:07:24.510
So that's why Food Runners
started 30 years ago,

00:07:24.510 --> 00:07:27.390
to supplement what the
food bank can't do.

00:07:27.390 --> 00:07:30.940
And currently, this is--

00:07:30.940 --> 00:07:36.420
so we could-- currently,
we're delivering food directly

00:07:36.420 --> 00:07:41.670
to places around town, as I
said earlier, that can serve

00:07:41.670 --> 00:07:43.840
it that night or the next day.

00:07:43.840 --> 00:07:47.160
So what is food waste?

00:07:47.160 --> 00:07:49.870
Food waste is a--

00:07:49.870 --> 00:07:52.030
no, let's go back to
that previous one.

00:07:52.030 --> 00:07:54.282
Let's go back to the previous--

00:07:54.282 --> 00:07:54.990
who's doing that?

00:07:54.990 --> 00:07:57.060
Who's clicking?

00:07:57.060 --> 00:07:58.270
You are.

00:07:58.270 --> 00:07:59.000
Oh she is.

00:07:59.000 --> 00:08:01.482
[LAUGHTER]

00:08:01.482 --> 00:08:02.190
So wait a minute.

00:08:02.190 --> 00:08:03.780
I saw Jon Stewart last night.

00:08:03.780 --> 00:08:05.880
He was hiding behind
something like this.

00:08:08.460 --> 00:08:09.389
Wait, I can do it.

00:08:09.389 --> 00:08:09.930
Let me do it.

00:08:09.930 --> 00:08:13.220
Show me how to do it.

00:08:13.220 --> 00:08:14.470
Oh yeah, I can't do it.

00:08:14.470 --> 00:08:16.140
OK, here we go.

00:08:16.140 --> 00:08:18.620
I want to do one
and then the other?

00:08:18.620 --> 00:08:22.640
OK, so look at this.

00:08:22.640 --> 00:08:25.950
So these are the statistics.

00:08:25.950 --> 00:08:29.330
So the estimate is that 40%
of the food in the country

00:08:29.330 --> 00:08:34.549
is discarded, and 20% of the
food that is bought and taken

00:08:34.549 --> 00:08:38.070
home is discarded.

00:08:38.070 --> 00:08:43.190
And as you know, there are
so very, very many people

00:08:43.190 --> 00:08:44.840
that are going to bed hungry.

00:08:44.840 --> 00:08:48.980
And one of the big problems
in this city, I think,

00:08:48.980 --> 00:08:54.140
is that if people have an
apartment and two or three

00:08:54.140 --> 00:08:56.640
kids, I mean, they
can usually pay rent,

00:08:56.640 --> 00:08:58.410
but they don't have
enough for food.

00:08:58.410 --> 00:09:00.980
So there's a lot
of hungry people.

00:09:00.980 --> 00:09:02.750
You've seen it all
down here, right?

00:09:02.750 --> 00:09:04.230
You see it all the time.

00:09:04.230 --> 00:09:12.140
So when we're talking
about rescuing

00:09:12.140 --> 00:09:17.120
perishable and prepared
foods, the first thing

00:09:17.120 --> 00:09:20.480
that comes to
everybody's mind is--

00:09:20.480 --> 00:09:22.700
when you go into a store
or go into a business,

00:09:22.700 --> 00:09:23.866
do you ever throw food away?

00:09:23.866 --> 00:09:25.700
They say, oh no, we
never throw food away.

00:09:25.700 --> 00:09:28.250
Well here's our card,
here's the phone number,

00:09:28.250 --> 00:09:32.150
here's our website.

00:09:32.150 --> 00:09:36.170
And then they will say, oh,
it's not the company policy.

00:09:36.170 --> 00:09:40.160
Well, who do I talk to
to change the policy?

00:09:40.160 --> 00:09:42.650
And then we're worried
about liability.

00:09:42.650 --> 00:09:47.840
Well, the bottom line
is in the United States,

00:09:47.840 --> 00:09:53.480
nobody has ever sued after
receiving donated food,

00:09:53.480 --> 00:09:57.370
and the donor has
been protected by laws

00:09:57.370 --> 00:10:01.640
since the '80s in California
and what's commonly

00:10:01.640 --> 00:10:05.050
called the Good
Samaritan Act in the '90s

00:10:05.050 --> 00:10:06.650
that Bill Clinton signed.

00:10:06.650 --> 00:10:11.750
So there is no need to--

00:10:11.750 --> 00:10:13.050
OK, I'm going to try it.

00:10:13.050 --> 00:10:15.680
Do do do do, it didn't work.

00:10:15.680 --> 00:10:17.930
[LAUGHTER]

00:10:19.730 --> 00:10:22.490
So there's no need
to fear liability.

00:10:22.490 --> 00:10:24.590
And so listen to this.

00:10:24.590 --> 00:10:26.660
So where does Food
Runners pick up food?

00:10:26.660 --> 00:10:30.200
We've been picking up at Whole
Foods at Franklin in California

00:10:30.200 --> 00:10:31.670
ever since they started.

00:10:31.670 --> 00:10:34.640
We pick up at every
Trader Joe's in the city,

00:10:34.640 --> 00:10:37.010
every Trader Joe's in the city.

00:10:37.010 --> 00:10:40.970
Listen, Trader Joe's doesn't
want publicity about it.

00:10:40.970 --> 00:10:43.790
They just do it out of the
goodness of their heart,

00:10:43.790 --> 00:10:46.500
and they give us milk.

00:10:46.500 --> 00:10:48.146
Next one please.

00:10:48.146 --> 00:10:50.486
[LAUGHTER]

00:10:51.890 --> 00:11:00.200
They give us milk, meat,
dairy, flowers that have all

00:11:00.200 --> 00:11:02.420
gone by their expiration date.

00:11:02.420 --> 00:11:06.730
Expiration dates doesn't
mean a fucking thing.

00:11:06.730 --> 00:11:11.075
What happens is it is
something that was created by--

00:11:13.941 --> 00:11:16.020
it's at the
manufacturer's discretion

00:11:16.020 --> 00:11:19.470
to put on the expiration date--

00:11:19.470 --> 00:11:23.640
buy by, expires after,
blah, blah, blah.

00:11:23.640 --> 00:11:24.720
There's nothing.

00:11:24.720 --> 00:11:30.090
I myself have kept a
chicken, a cooked chicken,

00:11:30.090 --> 00:11:36.870
and eaten it three weeks
after I roasted it.

00:11:36.870 --> 00:11:41.310
I've cooked with eggs six
weeks after I bought them.

00:11:41.310 --> 00:11:44.850
I've got cream in my fridge
that has an expiration

00:11:44.850 --> 00:11:47.700
date of it of October 26.

00:11:47.700 --> 00:11:50.640
I open it up, smell
it, and use it.

00:11:50.640 --> 00:11:51.720
You know that?

00:11:51.720 --> 00:11:54.480
I mean, we all know that.

00:11:54.480 --> 00:11:58.200
Don't throw it out until
it starts to smell.

00:11:58.200 --> 00:12:03.520
When I was at cooking school
in France 150 years ago,

00:12:03.520 --> 00:12:05.970
the chefs used to break
the egg and open it up

00:12:05.970 --> 00:12:08.600
and smell it to
see if it was bad.

00:12:08.600 --> 00:12:10.160
Can you imagine that?

00:12:10.160 --> 00:12:11.790
We don't get bad eggs.

00:12:11.790 --> 00:12:14.770
So where does food
waste come from?

00:12:14.770 --> 00:12:16.320
Where does food waste come from?

00:12:16.320 --> 00:12:19.920
The bottom line is the first
place that it comes from

00:12:19.920 --> 00:12:28.530
is the farmer doesn't want to
pay to have somebody go through

00:12:28.530 --> 00:12:30.690
and pick the strawberries again.

00:12:30.690 --> 00:12:32.460
So if the strawberries
or the peppers

00:12:32.460 --> 00:12:37.620
weren't ripe when he
hires the migrant workers,

00:12:37.620 --> 00:12:41.130
he doesn't want to pay
to have somebody go back

00:12:41.130 --> 00:12:42.540
and get it again.

00:12:42.540 --> 00:12:45.720
So nowadays, there's
groups called gleaners

00:12:45.720 --> 00:12:49.410
that are trying to go and get
the produce from the farms

00:12:49.410 --> 00:12:51.810
after the pickers
have gone through.

00:12:51.810 --> 00:12:54.750
The next thing that
happens, as you know,

00:12:54.750 --> 00:12:58.950
is that the guy sorting the
apples at the distribution

00:12:58.950 --> 00:13:00.270
center--

00:13:00.270 --> 00:13:01.260
this one he can sell.

00:13:01.260 --> 00:13:02.010
This one he can't.

00:13:02.010 --> 00:13:02.885
This one he can sell.

00:13:02.885 --> 00:13:03.990
This one he can't.

00:13:03.990 --> 00:13:07.530
So the ones that he can't sell
were used to be discarded.

00:13:07.530 --> 00:13:10.770
It wasn't worth his while.

00:13:10.770 --> 00:13:14.400
But now there's a group
here that will go and get

00:13:14.400 --> 00:13:16.560
what they call imperfect food.

00:13:16.560 --> 00:13:18.010
So that's a good one.

00:13:18.010 --> 00:13:21.570
The huge place for sources
food that we just talked about

00:13:21.570 --> 00:13:22.455
is grocery stores.

00:13:26.850 --> 00:13:29.880
We pick up at Whole Foods,
Trader Joe's, Gus's, we

00:13:29.880 --> 00:13:35.130
pick up, all over town, the food
that the grocery guy doesn't

00:13:35.130 --> 00:13:41.100
want to put out or the food
that doesn't sell and is

00:13:41.100 --> 00:13:42.000
a little too old.

00:13:42.000 --> 00:13:44.670
So that's what
Food Runner is for.

00:13:44.670 --> 00:13:47.700
And then another big
thing is, as you know,

00:13:47.700 --> 00:13:52.590
we just talked about 20% of the
food taken home is discarded.

00:13:52.590 --> 00:13:54.150
And I have to say,
the other day,

00:13:54.150 --> 00:13:56.340
I threw out five
carrots that had

00:13:56.340 --> 00:14:00.870
been in the bottom
of my fridge forever.

00:14:00.870 --> 00:14:03.840
They were just pretty bad
looking, wilted carrots.

00:14:03.840 --> 00:14:05.610
They actually looked
like something

00:14:05.610 --> 00:14:08.887
that Dominique Crenn would cook.

00:14:08.887 --> 00:14:09.720
She likes them all--

00:14:09.720 --> 00:14:12.240
[LAUGHTER]

00:14:12.240 --> 00:14:16.870
She likes to roast carrots
for 54 hours or something.

00:14:16.870 --> 00:14:20.280
But anyway, the reason I
put my website up there,

00:14:20.280 --> 00:14:23.580
the tantemarie.com
website, is, as I said,

00:14:23.580 --> 00:14:27.570
there are 350 recipes on there.

00:14:27.570 --> 00:14:30.000
We have a group of young--

00:14:30.000 --> 00:14:33.300
I say that in order
to get young and rich,

00:14:33.300 --> 00:14:36.000
you have to have blond
hair in San Francisco,

00:14:36.000 --> 00:14:41.310
and then you have to drive
an SUV Land Rover, or BMW,

00:14:41.310 --> 00:14:42.870
or Porsche.

00:14:42.870 --> 00:14:46.620
Alfa Romeo is coming
out with an SUV.

00:14:46.620 --> 00:14:50.340
And then you have to have
blond dogs and blond kids.

00:14:50.340 --> 00:14:54.660
Those blondes are
afraid of leftovers.

00:14:54.660 --> 00:14:57.810
So they go and they
buy their meal,

00:14:57.810 --> 00:15:01.060
and then they throw
the leftovers away.

00:15:01.060 --> 00:15:04.930
You don't have to
throw leftovers away.

00:15:04.930 --> 00:15:13.920
You could turn your leftovers
from leftover spaghetti

00:15:13.920 --> 00:15:17.640
and you can keep it in the
fridge for up to a week

00:15:17.640 --> 00:15:19.860
if it doesn't have
meat juices in it,

00:15:19.860 --> 00:15:24.810
and you can spread it
out in a buttered pan

00:15:24.810 --> 00:15:28.050
and beat up some eggs and throw
it in and make a frittata out

00:15:28.050 --> 00:15:29.550
of leftover spaghetti.

00:15:29.550 --> 00:15:31.320
You can make it
into something else.

00:15:33.870 --> 00:15:35.910
That's what people don't know.

00:15:35.910 --> 00:15:37.800
They say, oh, we
don't like leftovers,

00:15:37.800 --> 00:15:40.800
but good cooks know that you
can take leftovers and turn it

00:15:40.800 --> 00:15:42.030
into something else.

00:15:42.030 --> 00:15:43.890
What is salad nicoise?

00:15:43.890 --> 00:15:47.600
Leftover green beans,
leftover potatoes.

00:15:47.600 --> 00:15:49.820
Throw a can of tuna fish on.

00:15:49.820 --> 00:15:50.430
Am I right?

00:15:55.980 --> 00:16:02.670
The sources of food waste are
the farm, the distribution

00:16:02.670 --> 00:16:05.520
center, the grocery
store, and the home.

00:16:05.520 --> 00:16:10.800
And so if we can try and
pick up at those places

00:16:10.800 --> 00:16:14.250
and teach people how to
reuse their leftovers

00:16:14.250 --> 00:16:16.950
and not buy too much
that they don't need

00:16:16.950 --> 00:16:19.860
and don't worry about
expiration dates,

00:16:19.860 --> 00:16:22.380
then we can help to
avoid food waste.

00:16:22.380 --> 00:16:24.540
What can we do
about people here?

00:16:24.540 --> 00:16:30.090
So I am 70-fucking-6
years old, and I'm

00:16:30.090 --> 00:16:32.820
at the age where if
I go to a restaurant,

00:16:32.820 --> 00:16:34.590
I don't eat all the food.

00:16:34.590 --> 00:16:39.750
So what's happening for my
generation is a lot of people

00:16:39.750 --> 00:16:43.650
will eat half their
portion of chicken or fish

00:16:43.650 --> 00:16:46.830
or whatever it is and
then ask for a little box

00:16:46.830 --> 00:16:49.530
to take the rest
home in, then they

00:16:49.530 --> 00:16:51.480
eat it cold for
lunch the next day.

00:16:51.480 --> 00:16:54.000
That's what older women do.

00:16:54.000 --> 00:16:59.610
But how can you
teach Googlers not

00:16:59.610 --> 00:17:04.510
to take so much on their
plate and then they think,

00:17:04.510 --> 00:17:07.380
oh, well it's being composted.

00:17:07.380 --> 00:17:09.720
Still, you don't need
to take so much food

00:17:09.720 --> 00:17:13.200
if you're not going to eat it.

00:17:13.200 --> 00:17:15.150
How do you teach
people not to do it?

00:17:15.150 --> 00:17:16.319
I don't know.

00:17:16.319 --> 00:17:19.650
You tell them about
the 76-year-old lady

00:17:19.650 --> 00:17:23.369
that has a little box to
take home and eat it cold

00:17:23.369 --> 00:17:24.089
the next day.

00:17:27.329 --> 00:17:39.380
OK, next-- what we all know
is that if I take a plate of--

00:17:39.380 --> 00:17:45.560
today, I had delicious lentils
and noodles here for lunch.

00:17:45.560 --> 00:17:48.740
If I take too much
food on my plate,

00:17:48.740 --> 00:17:51.020
I can put it in a little
box and take it home.

00:17:51.020 --> 00:17:54.200
But the food that was all
out on the buffet that

00:17:54.200 --> 00:17:58.940
is not reusable for
another day, all

00:17:58.940 --> 00:18:00.725
can be packaged and donated.

00:18:04.580 --> 00:18:11.690
And that's why we have
so much tins of food

00:18:11.690 --> 00:18:15.650
from businesses like yours
that we pick up and take

00:18:15.650 --> 00:18:18.530
to the shelters.

00:18:18.530 --> 00:18:23.450
This is a list of
the five places

00:18:23.450 --> 00:18:28.080
that your food is donated
to five days a week.

00:18:28.080 --> 00:18:30.590
So you don't have
to hang out there.

00:18:30.590 --> 00:18:32.861
Come on, stand up.

00:18:32.861 --> 00:18:33.980
Come on, stand up.

00:18:33.980 --> 00:18:35.900
Look, we're the
Christmas girls--

00:18:35.900 --> 00:18:38.930
green and red.

00:18:38.930 --> 00:18:45.020
So the last place,
the Derek Silva,

00:18:45.020 --> 00:18:48.440
it's 68 units of
affordable housing.

00:18:48.440 --> 00:18:53.270
It is for people
living with HIV/AIDS.

00:18:53.270 --> 00:19:00.520
And so the food that Google is
donating through Food Runners,

00:19:00.520 --> 00:19:04.460
every day has been taken
to those five places--

00:19:04.460 --> 00:19:08.810
an agency serving
hot meals to anybody

00:19:08.810 --> 00:19:11.960
that comes to the door,
a mental health treatment

00:19:11.960 --> 00:19:18.500
program for ex-cons, a church
serving meals to the homeless,

00:19:18.500 --> 00:19:23.570
Canon Kip is elderly,
and Derek Silva is HIV.

00:19:23.570 --> 00:19:28.990
So those people are totally
spoiled by your food.

00:19:28.990 --> 00:19:31.970
And could we take
more from Google?

00:19:31.970 --> 00:19:33.620
The answer is yes.

00:19:33.620 --> 00:19:35.610
We can take the yogurt
that's over there.

00:19:35.610 --> 00:19:40.040
We can take the fruit
that's in the cafes.

00:19:40.040 --> 00:19:43.070
We can take everything
that has not

00:19:43.070 --> 00:19:45.220
been served on a
plate to somebody

00:19:45.220 --> 00:19:46.970
sitting there, spitting
on it, and putting

00:19:46.970 --> 00:19:48.920
their fingers in it, OK?

00:19:51.440 --> 00:19:54.830
For instance, I'll take
those pumpkins when I leave.

00:19:54.830 --> 00:19:55.881
[LAUGHTER]

00:19:56.380 --> 00:19:58.760
I'll put those in my purse.

00:19:58.760 --> 00:20:02.270
All buffet food is donatable.

00:20:02.270 --> 00:20:05.510
We pick up at the Hilton today.

00:20:05.510 --> 00:20:08.540
We're picking up at
the Ritz-Carlton today.

00:20:12.140 --> 00:20:18.170
From the Ritz-Carlton, it's
taken about nine months, where,

00:20:18.170 --> 00:20:21.590
first, we got their
leftover banquet food,

00:20:21.590 --> 00:20:23.450
and now we're getting
the leftover food

00:20:23.450 --> 00:20:25.940
from the takeout places.

00:20:25.940 --> 00:20:29.390
But it's just amazing
the misinformation

00:20:29.390 --> 00:20:30.800
that people have.

00:20:30.800 --> 00:20:33.020
I heard once about somebody--

00:20:33.020 --> 00:20:36.700
it was actually a
Bon Appétit company.

00:20:36.700 --> 00:20:41.135
Down in the peninsula, Bon
Appétit is the food provider.

00:20:44.240 --> 00:20:48.890
They put out yogurt in an ice
bath, and when the ice melts,

00:20:48.890 --> 00:20:50.510
they throw the yogurt out.

00:20:50.510 --> 00:20:52.460
I mean, that's ridiculous.

00:20:52.460 --> 00:20:54.395
Yogurt is bacteria.

00:20:54.395 --> 00:20:55.270
Yogurt keeps forever.

00:20:55.270 --> 00:20:56.670
[LAUGHTER]

00:20:57.170 --> 00:21:00.830
So no food needs
to be thrown away.

00:21:00.830 --> 00:21:02.860
You can donate it.

00:21:02.860 --> 00:21:06.830
Just put it in a package
and call Food Runners.

00:21:06.830 --> 00:21:09.350
So can I have the next--

00:21:09.350 --> 00:21:11.760
the next one's probably a photo.

00:21:11.760 --> 00:21:13.310
So what is food waste?

00:21:13.310 --> 00:21:17.420
Food waste has
many sources, but I

00:21:17.420 --> 00:21:22.070
think it's kind of uneducated
people that don't know

00:21:22.070 --> 00:21:24.470
or it's people that don't care--

00:21:24.470 --> 00:21:30.290
one more-- or they're in the
habit of throwing food away.

00:21:36.732 --> 00:21:41.870
It takes a long time to get
people to change their habits.

00:21:41.870 --> 00:21:50.390
And so the habits are take only
what you think you can eat,

00:21:50.390 --> 00:21:58.790
save the rest to
donate, and see that

00:21:58.790 --> 00:22:01.820
a responsible organization,
like Food Runners,

00:22:01.820 --> 00:22:05.480
picks it up and takes it
where it can best be used.

00:22:05.480 --> 00:22:13.010
The next thing that I think what
you can help Food Runners with

00:22:13.010 --> 00:22:16.970
is, first of all, maybe we could
pass these out to everybody

00:22:16.970 --> 00:22:19.170
and pass these out to everybody.

00:22:19.170 --> 00:22:26.180
So the deal is that because
I'm an old secretary,

00:22:26.180 --> 00:22:33.540
I do things with
cards and brochures,

00:22:33.540 --> 00:22:35.400
but hold on to these.

00:22:35.400 --> 00:22:38.170
And so we're still kind
of in the process--

00:22:38.170 --> 00:22:41.080
at Food Runners, we're
kind of in the "pro-cess"--

00:22:41.080 --> 00:22:44.160
that's Canadian for process.

00:22:44.160 --> 00:22:48.420
We're kind of in the process
of trying to get more

00:22:48.420 --> 00:22:50.220
into the new technology.

00:22:50.220 --> 00:22:57.430
For instance, we are
working on an app,

00:22:57.430 --> 00:23:01.620
but currently, people can donate
through the website or the app.

00:23:01.620 --> 00:23:04.410
We still have a phone
with an answering service.

00:23:04.410 --> 00:23:07.740
So people can call
and leave a message

00:23:07.740 --> 00:23:09.360
on an answering service--

00:23:09.360 --> 00:23:12.700
I mean a voicemail.

00:23:12.700 --> 00:23:18.310
But I think how you
can help, as Googlers,

00:23:18.310 --> 00:23:22.650
as San Franciscans, and
as concerned people,

00:23:22.650 --> 00:23:26.310
is first of all,
tell your friends.

00:23:26.310 --> 00:23:28.350
Tell your friends.

00:23:28.350 --> 00:23:36.090
The best volunteers for us are
people who are in between jobs.

00:23:36.090 --> 00:23:37.950
People who are in between jobs.

00:23:37.950 --> 00:23:38.730
That's fine.

00:23:38.730 --> 00:23:40.980
People who are in
between jobs or recently

00:23:40.980 --> 00:23:43.200
retired make really
good volunteers

00:23:43.200 --> 00:23:45.820
because they're used to
getting up and going somewhere.

00:23:45.820 --> 00:23:48.300
So if you know anybody
that's recently

00:23:48.300 --> 00:23:54.110
retired or between jobs, and
they have their own vehicle,

00:23:54.110 --> 00:23:56.490
this is a really good
place to volunteer,

00:23:56.490 --> 00:23:58.590
is with Food Runners.

00:23:58.590 --> 00:24:03.960
We also could use help
through social media

00:24:03.960 --> 00:24:08.880
by taking pictures of the food
you're donating and saying,

00:24:08.880 --> 00:24:12.000
this is going to neighborhood
shelters through Food Runners.

00:24:12.000 --> 00:24:15.990
So we could use the
help with social media.

00:24:15.990 --> 00:24:22.170
We can use help with telling
everybody you know with food.

00:24:22.170 --> 00:24:25.815
And what else can
we use help with?

00:24:25.815 --> 00:24:28.586
If you know anybody with a car--

00:24:28.586 --> 00:24:30.210
So I want to tell
you a little bit more

00:24:30.210 --> 00:24:33.900
about some of the people
that are volunteers for us.

00:24:33.900 --> 00:24:39.060
There's a man who came here--
actually, I shouldn't say this,

00:24:39.060 --> 00:24:41.520
but he also came
here in the '50s

00:24:41.520 --> 00:24:43.830
and earned his living
as a drug dealer.

00:24:43.830 --> 00:24:48.060
And then he went into the
waterproofing and painting

00:24:48.060 --> 00:24:49.110
business.

00:24:49.110 --> 00:24:55.290
And this guy has been picking
up, at the Ferry Plaza Farmers

00:24:55.290 --> 00:25:00.030
Market, all the leftover
food from the farmers

00:25:00.030 --> 00:25:05.610
every Saturday whenever
he's in San Francisco.

00:25:05.610 --> 00:25:07.320
He goes and gets the truck.

00:25:07.320 --> 00:25:10.140
We use a truck for
large donations.

00:25:10.140 --> 00:25:12.990
He goes and gets the
truck, and he's a Brit.

00:25:12.990 --> 00:25:15.330
So you can see him
at 1:30, 12:30,

00:25:15.330 --> 00:25:17.870
1:00 o'clock at the
Ferry building going,

00:25:17.870 --> 00:25:23.520
Food Runners, Food Runners,
bring out your food.

00:25:23.520 --> 00:25:26.970
So it takes him
four hours every day

00:25:26.970 --> 00:25:30.870
to deliver all the food that
the farmers bring him because he

00:25:30.870 --> 00:25:34.290
has a relationship with them.

00:25:34.290 --> 00:25:36.255
And then the farmers
at the Ferry building

00:25:36.255 --> 00:25:40.430
bring him up even extra
food on Saturdays.

00:25:40.430 --> 00:25:42.360
There is another
guy, kind of who

00:25:42.360 --> 00:25:44.430
I would call a trust fund baby.

00:25:44.430 --> 00:25:48.150
He's a well-to-do
man who lives out

00:25:48.150 --> 00:25:50.880
on Washington Street
in Pacific Heights

00:25:50.880 --> 00:25:53.940
and he has a
17-year-old daughter.

00:25:53.940 --> 00:25:57.300
And he and his daughter go
on food runs every Saturday.

00:26:02.070 --> 00:26:06.570
He does Saturday at Kara's
Cupcakes on Steiner Street--

00:26:06.570 --> 00:26:07.770
no, Scott Street.

00:26:07.770 --> 00:26:11.080
And he takes bread
and pastries out

00:26:11.080 --> 00:26:16.760
to the veteran's
home up on Presidio.

00:26:16.760 --> 00:26:17.760
That's on Saturday.

00:26:17.760 --> 00:26:21.060
On Sunday, he goes to the
farmers market at Fort Mason

00:26:21.060 --> 00:26:23.280
and picks up all
their leftover foods

00:26:23.280 --> 00:26:26.380
and takes it to a place
called Walden House--

00:26:26.380 --> 00:26:28.130
that I call Walden house--

00:26:28.130 --> 00:26:29.335
on Hays and Fillmore.

00:26:33.480 --> 00:26:36.120
And then there's a guy
called Sam Haskins.

00:26:36.120 --> 00:26:41.070
Sam Haskins will go
today at about 3:30

00:26:41.070 --> 00:26:43.080
to a restaurant
called [INAUDIBLE],,

00:26:43.080 --> 00:26:45.890
who makes foil trays
of food for him.

00:26:49.460 --> 00:26:52.590
He's a lawyer who writes books.

00:26:52.590 --> 00:26:54.900
We also have women
doing deliveries, too.

00:26:58.740 --> 00:27:01.380
The volunteers for Food
Runners, some of them

00:27:01.380 --> 00:27:04.740
have been volunteers
for 30 years.

00:27:04.740 --> 00:27:06.540
Some people like to
know that they're

00:27:06.540 --> 00:27:09.750
going to go every
Friday at 4:00 o'clock

00:27:09.750 --> 00:27:11.460
in the afternoon to
pick up the leftover

00:27:11.460 --> 00:27:15.090
food at the Williams-Sonoma
corporate office.

00:27:15.090 --> 00:27:18.930
And some people like to know
that they're going to go.

00:27:18.930 --> 00:27:20.880
Oh, there's a brand new place.

00:27:20.880 --> 00:27:22.650
I don't know if
you've been to it.

00:27:22.650 --> 00:27:26.970
It's called Meraki.

00:27:26.970 --> 00:27:32.800
It's a society deli on Post
between Larkin And Hyde

00:27:32.800 --> 00:27:35.470
that just opened two weeks ago.

00:27:35.470 --> 00:27:38.500
A guy called Stanlee
Gatti is the owner,

00:27:38.500 --> 00:27:41.590
and he brought in a bunch
of New York hotshots

00:27:41.590 --> 00:27:47.110
and they put all this kombucha,
and sauerkraut, and chia seeds,

00:27:47.110 --> 00:27:48.940
and all these trendy
food in there.

00:27:52.870 --> 00:27:55.120
Then you go, what are
they doing on Post

00:27:55.120 --> 00:27:56.230
between Larkin and Hyde?

00:27:56.230 --> 00:28:00.190
It's kind of like a
renters neighborhood,

00:28:00.190 --> 00:28:03.740
but they've got all the society
people coming in their limos,

00:28:03.740 --> 00:28:06.580
and they send their
chauffeurs to pick up food.

00:28:06.580 --> 00:28:12.910
But that new deli on Post
Street is giving off all

00:28:12.910 --> 00:28:15.220
their leftover food--

00:28:15.220 --> 00:28:16.540
I went and picked up myself--

00:28:16.540 --> 00:28:20.402
every night at 9:00 o'clock
the first week they were open.

00:28:20.402 --> 00:28:22.110
And now, they save
the food in the cooler

00:28:22.110 --> 00:28:24.520
and we pick it up the next day.

00:28:24.520 --> 00:28:25.650
Have you been there?

00:28:25.650 --> 00:28:27.993
AUDIENCE: No, I was just
thinking it might the old Fleur

00:28:27.993 --> 00:28:29.840
de Lis spot.

00:28:29.840 --> 00:28:31.090
MARY RISLEY: That's on Sutter.

00:28:31.090 --> 00:28:32.170
This is Post.

00:28:32.170 --> 00:28:35.920
It's a kind of crappy building.

00:28:35.920 --> 00:28:40.068
So I got to tell more jokes
or he got a phone call.

00:28:40.068 --> 00:28:41.472
[LAUGHTER]

00:28:42.760 --> 00:28:49.690
So anyway, we pick up at
bakeries, grocery stores,

00:28:49.690 --> 00:28:52.390
delis like this
place, Mollie Stone's.

00:28:52.390 --> 00:28:53.500
So listen to this.

00:28:53.500 --> 00:28:58.770
So I am in Mollie Stone's
all the time on California

00:28:58.770 --> 00:29:02.350
and Franklin, and
it's taken me 10 years

00:29:02.350 --> 00:29:07.940
to get the Mollie Stone's to
donate their leftover food.

00:29:07.940 --> 00:29:11.530
And what changed their mind was
I named my dog Mollie Stone.

00:29:11.530 --> 00:29:14.075
I got a new dog last year
and called it Mollie Stone.

00:29:14.075 --> 00:29:16.311
[LAUGHTER]

00:29:16.810 --> 00:29:19.930
But you know, it's hard
to convince people,

00:29:19.930 --> 00:29:22.010
as I said, to
change their habits,

00:29:22.010 --> 00:29:27.180
but we have 200 volunteers.

00:29:27.180 --> 00:29:32.710
We're picking up
500 times a week

00:29:32.710 --> 00:29:36.580
with a van, a truck,
and our volunteers

00:29:36.580 --> 00:29:40.570
with regular runs, and then
other people that are on-call.

00:29:40.570 --> 00:29:43.090
Some people just like to be
on-call, get in their car

00:29:43.090 --> 00:29:44.270
and go.

00:29:44.270 --> 00:29:46.750
And we also pick up--

00:29:46.750 --> 00:29:50.710
I talked about the
Ritz-Carlton and the Hilton.

00:29:50.710 --> 00:29:52.900
We also pick up from caterers.

00:29:52.900 --> 00:29:56.080
There's a big caterer
called Dan McCall,

00:29:56.080 --> 00:29:59.620
who has a commissary
kitchen on 17th Street.

00:29:59.620 --> 00:30:03.880
He will take back his leftover
food to the commissary kitchen,

00:30:03.880 --> 00:30:06.890
and we'll come the next
day and pick it up.

00:30:06.890 --> 00:30:11.350
There's another caterer called
Paula LeDuc out of Emeryville.

00:30:11.350 --> 00:30:13.630
So she doesn't take
it back to Emeryville.

00:30:13.630 --> 00:30:17.770
She calls us and we pick
it up at 1:30 at night.

00:30:17.770 --> 00:30:20.140
So somebody suggested
recently that maybe we

00:30:20.140 --> 00:30:21.910
should have Uber drivers.

00:30:21.910 --> 00:30:23.110
We should have Uber--

00:30:23.110 --> 00:30:26.230
because of their
bad reputation--

00:30:26.230 --> 00:30:32.530
sponsor cars going around
and picking up food for us.

00:30:32.530 --> 00:30:35.740
And you go, oh, I
don't know because they

00:30:35.740 --> 00:30:40.610
might Get creamed chicken all
over the back of their car.

00:30:40.610 --> 00:30:47.590
So anyway, the regular
people, we have 500 people--

00:30:47.590 --> 00:30:50.830
no, 150 people, a
truck driver, a van,

00:30:50.830 --> 00:30:53.410
and a couple of cargo
bikes going around

00:30:53.410 --> 00:30:57.940
and picking up food either as
regular runners or volunteers.

00:30:57.940 --> 00:31:01.420
And I still need that last
thing about the call to action.

00:31:01.420 --> 00:31:03.200
The call to action.

00:31:03.200 --> 00:31:04.330
What can you do to help?

00:31:04.330 --> 00:31:06.430
You can help us
with social media.

00:31:06.430 --> 00:31:09.430
You can help us with spreading
the word to food businesses.

00:31:09.430 --> 00:31:12.280
You can help us with
letting anybody who

00:31:12.280 --> 00:31:14.290
might want to be a volunteer--

00:31:14.290 --> 00:31:15.130
no.

00:31:15.130 --> 00:31:18.580
And then the fourth
way, I can't remember.

00:31:18.580 --> 00:31:21.340
So we'll have to
get back to that.

00:31:21.340 --> 00:31:26.080
We'll get back to spread
the word, tell your friends,

00:31:26.080 --> 00:31:31.210
and help us get more food to
those in need in San Francisco.

00:31:31.210 --> 00:31:32.921
Before I open it
up for questions,

00:31:32.921 --> 00:31:34.420
I want to tell you
a little bit more

00:31:34.420 --> 00:31:39.630
about this place that I like to
take food to while-- oh, yes.

00:31:39.630 --> 00:31:40.580
Listen to this.

00:31:40.580 --> 00:31:47.830
So the other day, somebody
donated three garbage bags

00:31:47.830 --> 00:31:50.500
full of these paper
containers that you

00:31:50.500 --> 00:31:52.420
might take soup home in.

00:31:52.420 --> 00:31:54.670
So I took them to Walden House.

00:31:54.670 --> 00:31:56.470
But I want to tell you
about Walden House.

00:31:56.470 --> 00:32:01.060
Walden House is now
called HealthRIGHT 360,

00:32:01.060 --> 00:32:05.230
and they recruit men
and women coming out

00:32:05.230 --> 00:32:10.330
of jail who've had repeated--
who keep going back to having

00:32:10.330 --> 00:32:13.090
drugs and getting into trouble.

00:32:13.090 --> 00:32:17.020
And they house them
for six months.

00:32:17.020 --> 00:32:18.520
And so it's a rehab center.

00:32:18.520 --> 00:32:21.370
They have eight locations
in San Francisco.

00:32:21.370 --> 00:32:25.870
And what has happened is
that because of the food

00:32:25.870 --> 00:32:32.530
that we bring them from people
like you, that has saved them

00:32:32.530 --> 00:32:35.710
$2 million a year that
they would otherwise

00:32:35.710 --> 00:32:39.410
have to spend on buying
and making food for them.

00:32:39.410 --> 00:32:43.390
So thank you, Google,
for all your food.

00:32:43.390 --> 00:32:46.880
Thank you for YouTube
where I got my fame.

00:32:46.880 --> 00:32:49.360
And what kind of
questions do you

00:32:49.360 --> 00:32:55.266
have for me about food rescue,
food waste, and Food Runners?

00:32:55.266 --> 00:32:56.890
SPEAKER 1: I see I've
got two questions

00:32:56.890 --> 00:33:00.730
from Kevin [INAUDIBLE].

00:33:00.730 --> 00:33:03.640
So he has two questions for you.

00:33:03.640 --> 00:33:08.110
So what policies
should we be trying

00:33:08.110 --> 00:33:12.940
to pass to lower
barriers to sharing food?

00:33:12.940 --> 00:33:14.106
MARY RISLEY: What policies--

00:33:14.106 --> 00:33:15.130
SPEAKER 1: Yes.

00:33:15.130 --> 00:33:17.050
MARY RISLEY: --should we pass?

00:33:17.050 --> 00:33:21.772
SPEAKER 1: Yes, to lower
barriers to sharing food.

00:33:21.772 --> 00:33:23.230
MARY RISLEY: There
are no policies.

00:33:23.230 --> 00:33:26.450
Just pick up the fucking food.

00:33:26.450 --> 00:33:32.500
SPEAKER 1: OK, the second
one, should be more actively

00:33:32.500 --> 00:33:37.320
push people to be vegetarians
given that [INAUDIBLE]..

00:33:37.320 --> 00:33:42.430
MARY RISLEY: So should we
push people to be vegetarians?

00:33:42.430 --> 00:33:47.180
I don't think that has anything
to do with rescuing food.

00:33:47.180 --> 00:33:48.160
Listen to this.

00:33:48.160 --> 00:33:53.800
In San Francisco,
it's well-known

00:33:53.800 --> 00:33:57.400
that the homeless people
are the pickiest eaters.

00:33:57.400 --> 00:34:00.620
So if you were to go serve
food at Glide or St. Anthony

00:34:00.620 --> 00:34:03.010
or Martin de Porres
you do have people

00:34:03.010 --> 00:34:06.460
going through the line saying,
does that have sugar in it?

00:34:06.460 --> 00:34:08.290
Does that have gluten in it?

00:34:12.760 --> 00:34:17.500
Even the homeless and the
hungry are picky eaters here.

00:34:17.500 --> 00:34:22.690
But I think vegetarianism
is a personal choice.

00:34:22.690 --> 00:34:23.768
Yes sweetheart?

00:34:27.480 --> 00:34:30.699
AUDIENCE: Hello, hello,
hello, testing, testing.

00:34:30.699 --> 00:34:34.870
I was just curious, what
inspired the inspiration

00:34:34.870 --> 00:34:36.507
for the initial--

00:34:36.507 --> 00:34:37.090
here you were.

00:34:37.090 --> 00:34:40.374
You were running
a cooking school.

00:34:40.374 --> 00:34:42.290
And then you decided to
start this Food Runner

00:34:42.290 --> 00:34:42.956
some time later.

00:34:42.956 --> 00:34:44.320
You said 1987.

00:34:44.320 --> 00:34:45.880
What was happening
at that moment?

00:34:45.880 --> 00:34:48.100
What did you see?

00:34:48.100 --> 00:34:52.150
MARY RISLEY: Quite frankly I
used to stop in my red Alfa

00:34:52.150 --> 00:34:54.969
Romeo at the corner of--

00:34:54.969 --> 00:34:58.300
every day I crossed the corner
of Chestnut and Columbus.

00:34:58.300 --> 00:35:00.550
And you'd see people going
through the garbage looking

00:35:00.550 --> 00:35:01.720
for food.

00:35:01.720 --> 00:35:06.970
And so what I did, at one
time at my cooking school

00:35:06.970 --> 00:35:10.300
we did a two-day
wedding-cake workshop.

00:35:10.300 --> 00:35:14.890
And so at the end of the
two days, we cut into them,

00:35:14.890 --> 00:35:18.250
we tasted it, but I had
seven wedding cakes.

00:35:18.250 --> 00:35:20.560
Do I drive them to Glide?

00:35:20.560 --> 00:35:24.280
Do I give them to the staff?

00:35:24.280 --> 00:35:28.880
Or do I throw them
in the garbage?

00:35:28.880 --> 00:35:32.530
And so I thought, there
must be other people

00:35:32.530 --> 00:35:35.420
in the food business that
have that same question.

00:35:35.420 --> 00:35:38.320
And the truth is I
still have that car too.

00:35:38.320 --> 00:35:42.400
And I still have buttercream
all over the steering wheel

00:35:42.400 --> 00:35:43.910
because I drove it to Glide.

00:35:43.910 --> 00:35:47.620
I drove those wedding
cakes to Glide in 1986.

00:35:47.620 --> 00:35:50.560
I approached the
mayor's office--

00:35:50.560 --> 00:35:52.780
Dianne Feinstein
was the mayor then--

00:35:52.780 --> 00:35:56.470
and said I have food
connections, can we help?

00:35:56.470 --> 00:35:59.350
And she introduced me
to a woman in Berkeley

00:35:59.350 --> 00:36:04.060
who was kind of a whole
Mother Earth type of woman.

00:36:04.060 --> 00:36:06.260
And she taught me
how to do this.

00:36:06.260 --> 00:36:10.142
And so we started with a small
group of people, Food Runners,

00:36:10.142 --> 00:36:12.100
saying we're going to
provide this free service

00:36:12.100 --> 00:36:14.380
to any business
in San Francisco.

00:36:14.380 --> 00:36:20.450
And so what do you do if you
have a party in your home

00:36:20.450 --> 00:36:23.650
and then not everybody comes?

00:36:23.650 --> 00:36:28.950
So what you can do as
a home cook is package

00:36:28.950 --> 00:36:34.930
the food and you can look on
foodrunners.org, the website,

00:36:34.930 --> 00:36:37.300
and it'll tell you where
your neighborhood place

00:36:37.300 --> 00:36:38.599
that you can take food to.

00:36:38.599 --> 00:36:40.390
If you live in North
Beach, you can take it

00:36:40.390 --> 00:36:41.710
to North Beach Citizens.

00:36:41.710 --> 00:36:45.340
If you live out by-- there's
a place called Edgewood out

00:36:45.340 --> 00:36:47.110
by the zoo, things like that.

00:36:47.110 --> 00:36:51.820
So we can't pick up in homes,
but home food can be taken.

00:36:55.060 --> 00:36:57.077
OK, does that answer
your question?

00:36:57.077 --> 00:36:57.660
AUDIENCE: Yes.

00:36:57.660 --> 00:36:59.410
And one more quick
question-- have

00:36:59.410 --> 00:37:01.527
you seen the
documentary "Wasted",

00:37:01.527 --> 00:37:03.610
and what do you think of
Anthony fucking Bourdain?

00:37:03.610 --> 00:37:05.845
[LAUGHTER]

00:37:07.087 --> 00:37:08.920
MARY RISLEY: I haven't
seen the documentary.

00:37:08.920 --> 00:37:10.930
They asked me if I would in it.

00:37:10.930 --> 00:37:14.645
And he's definitely a newcomer
to the whole thing, you know?

00:37:14.645 --> 00:37:15.895
Have you seen the documentary?

00:37:15.895 --> 00:37:16.660
AUDIENCE: We just saw it.

00:37:16.660 --> 00:37:17.700
MARY RISLEY: Was it any good?

00:37:17.700 --> 00:37:18.730
AUDIENCE: It was
actually pretty good.

00:37:18.730 --> 00:37:19.670
MARY RISLEY: Yeah.

00:37:19.670 --> 00:37:22.810
So Tony Bourdain, as you
know, has made his reputation

00:37:22.810 --> 00:37:26.320
as a bad boy, throwing
cigarette butts in melted butter

00:37:26.320 --> 00:37:30.280
and restaurants where he worked
in Grand Central Station.

00:37:30.280 --> 00:37:34.960
But he has great writers
and great producers.

00:37:34.960 --> 00:37:38.000
And so if they're helping the
food movement, God bless them.

00:37:45.132 --> 00:37:46.090
AUDIENCE: Hello, hello.

00:37:46.090 --> 00:37:46.940
MARY RISLEY: Hi.

00:37:46.940 --> 00:37:47.620
Hello, hello.

00:37:47.620 --> 00:37:48.812
AUDIENCE: Hello.

00:37:48.812 --> 00:37:50.770
I was introduced to your
company about 10 years

00:37:50.770 --> 00:37:52.630
while working in grocery,
working on Whole Foods.

00:37:52.630 --> 00:37:54.254
And so it was a very
interesting moment

00:37:54.254 --> 00:37:56.547
of just like the
idea of food waste

00:37:56.547 --> 00:37:57.880
and how it's being acknowledged.

00:37:57.880 --> 00:37:59.440
And it seems perhaps
like you guys

00:37:59.440 --> 00:38:01.570
could have been kind of
like setting an industry

00:38:01.570 --> 00:38:02.357
standard for such.

00:38:02.357 --> 00:38:03.190
And I'm curious if--

00:38:03.190 --> 00:38:04.052
MARY RISLEY: I think we were--

00:38:04.052 --> 00:38:04.350
AUDIENCE: --other cities--

00:38:04.350 --> 00:38:05.620
MARY RISLEY: --one of the
first in the country, yeah.

00:38:05.620 --> 00:38:07.630
AUDIENCE: Yeah, so have
other cities come to you?

00:38:07.630 --> 00:38:09.088
MARY RISLEY: I
think totally, yeah.

00:38:09.088 --> 00:38:15.850
So what happens is there is
now a kind of a food waste--

00:38:15.850 --> 00:38:20.350
I mean a food recovery group in
Sonoma County that I trained.

00:38:20.350 --> 00:38:22.560
There's one in Marin
County that I helped train.

00:38:22.560 --> 00:38:23.770
There's one on the peninsula.

00:38:23.770 --> 00:38:24.550
I helped train.

00:38:24.550 --> 00:38:26.710
There's one in
Wilkes-Barre, Pennsylvania

00:38:26.710 --> 00:38:28.080
that I helped work with.

00:38:28.080 --> 00:38:30.840
There's one in
Northwest Connecticut.

00:38:30.840 --> 00:38:32.675
And there's a great
one in Toronto

00:38:32.675 --> 00:38:34.300
that I didn't have
anything to do with.

00:38:34.300 --> 00:38:38.830
But food waste is
becoming a huge topic.

00:38:38.830 --> 00:38:44.440
And I even saw it on the
side of a moving van.

00:38:44.440 --> 00:38:47.170
I can't remember the name
of the moving company,

00:38:47.170 --> 00:38:53.920
but it had a big sign on it
saying moveforhunger.org.

00:38:53.920 --> 00:38:56.980
And it appears that
the moving company

00:38:56.980 --> 00:39:00.160
that's getting
all your furniture

00:39:00.160 --> 00:39:02.620
and taking it
somewhere will also

00:39:02.620 --> 00:39:06.130
take all your food from your
cupboards and donate it.

00:39:06.130 --> 00:39:09.040
So food waste is becoming
a really good topic.

00:39:09.040 --> 00:39:13.030
And it's great that everybody
is becoming involved in it.

00:39:16.800 --> 00:39:17.820
Any other questions?

00:39:21.000 --> 00:39:24.280
So the other thing that
I am going to finish with

00:39:24.280 --> 00:39:31.500
is, I know that most of you are
trained professionals in food.

00:39:31.500 --> 00:39:36.730
And I want to tell
you a story about--

00:39:36.730 --> 00:39:42.540
so we had a truck donated
to us 20 years ago from UPS,

00:39:42.540 --> 00:39:45.270
and it was a refrigerated truck.

00:39:45.270 --> 00:39:49.980
And so I went to a party
at the middle of the night,

00:39:49.980 --> 00:39:52.830
put all the donated food in it.

00:39:55.920 --> 00:39:59.700
We used a parking space
at Royal Hawaiian Seafood

00:39:59.700 --> 00:40:00.930
and plugged it in.

00:40:00.930 --> 00:40:02.110
I plugged in.

00:40:02.110 --> 00:40:04.680
But the next day I went
back to get the truck

00:40:04.680 --> 00:40:07.500
to deliver the food
to the shelters

00:40:07.500 --> 00:40:14.680
and it was clear that the
refrigeration didn't work.

00:40:14.680 --> 00:40:21.450
And so I had big bags of carrots
and celery, bread, and bags

00:40:21.450 --> 00:40:23.970
of cooked chicken.

00:40:23.970 --> 00:40:29.220
And so what I did was I drove
the truck to 5th and Bryant,

00:40:29.220 --> 00:40:31.380
to the shelter at
5th and Bryant,

00:40:31.380 --> 00:40:37.110
and taking the bags
of bread inside,

00:40:37.110 --> 00:40:38.790
taking the carrots inside.

00:40:38.790 --> 00:40:42.360
And I tried to put the
chicken into the dumpster.

00:40:42.360 --> 00:40:45.600
And the homeless guys that were
waiting to get in the shelter

00:40:45.600 --> 00:40:47.460
started climbing
in the dumpster.

00:40:47.460 --> 00:40:49.670
And I'm like, oh, no,
no, you can't eat that.

00:40:49.670 --> 00:40:51.450
It'll make you sick.

00:40:51.450 --> 00:40:54.480
And they go, "Lady,
we're hungry."

00:40:54.480 --> 00:40:59.940
You know, there's no
need to fear liability.

00:40:59.940 --> 00:41:02.520
And I don't care what the
health department says

00:41:02.520 --> 00:41:06.090
in San Francisco or
Wilkes-Barre, Pennsylvania

00:41:06.090 --> 00:41:07.710
or Truckee, California.

00:41:11.250 --> 00:41:13.050
If you let the
health department--

00:41:13.050 --> 00:41:15.780
I mean of course you have
to obey their rules when

00:41:15.780 --> 00:41:17.540
you're in the food business.

00:41:17.540 --> 00:41:21.090
But they will try
and tell you, oh, it

00:41:21.090 --> 00:41:23.880
has to be chilled at this
temperature and raised to the--

00:41:23.880 --> 00:41:25.960
and take the
fucking temperature.

00:41:25.960 --> 00:41:30.097
No, it's food and
they're hungry people.

00:41:30.097 --> 00:41:32.430
They're not going to follow
you out the door to find out

00:41:32.430 --> 00:41:35.520
where the salad is going.

00:41:35.520 --> 00:41:38.825
I'm an old hippie from the '60s.

00:41:46.540 --> 00:41:49.650
We can't be run by
rules and regulations

00:41:49.650 --> 00:41:51.160
when there are hungry people.

00:41:51.160 --> 00:41:54.210
And we have to, as
civilized human beings,

00:41:54.210 --> 00:41:57.120
we have to take care of
our fellow human beings.

00:41:57.120 --> 00:41:59.850
As far as I know,
we're the only animal

00:41:59.850 --> 00:42:04.050
in the world that heats food
and makes it taste good.

00:42:07.410 --> 00:42:13.170
We aren't like deer or raccoons
going around the Presidio

00:42:13.170 --> 00:42:14.140
picking up food.

00:42:17.460 --> 00:42:20.400
And we have to take care
of our fellow human beings.

00:42:20.400 --> 00:42:24.450
And with one out of
every four people

00:42:24.450 --> 00:42:26.640
going to bed hungry
in San Francisco,

00:42:26.640 --> 00:42:30.650
we need to do everything
we can to help them.

00:42:30.650 --> 00:42:31.820
Thank you.

00:42:31.820 --> 00:42:35.770
[APPLAUSE]
