00:00:00.330 --> 00:00:03.360
The framework vendors however had made some

00:00:03.360 --> 00:00:06.870
design decisions that differentiate their approaches.

00:00:06.870 --> 00:00:09.830
For example, they often differ on memory management.

00:00:09.830 --> 00:00:14.710
Java and CLR provide garbage collection, COM provides reference counting, and

00:00:14.710 --> 00:00:17.170
CORBA doesn't provide anything at all.

00:00:17.170 --> 00:00:20.480
As far as container managed persistence is concerned,

00:00:20.480 --> 00:00:24.060
Java has Enterprise Java Beans.

00:00:24.060 --> 00:00:27.950
CORBA has CCM, but CLR and Compost don't provide anything.

00:00:29.250 --> 00:00:32.645
The vendors also have various approaches for the versioning,

00:00:32.645 --> 00:00:36.150
some of them freeze, some of them have version numbers, some of them have

00:00:36.150 --> 00:00:40.750
compatibility rules, and some of them allow for side-by-side execution.

00:00:40.750 --> 00:00:43.700
Some other differences include the target environment for

00:00:43.700 --> 00:00:44.800
the component frameworks.

00:00:44.800 --> 00:00:48.670
J2EE and COM target servers.

00:00:48.670 --> 00:00:50.590
COM also targets client and

00:00:50.590 --> 00:00:54.720
desktop machines, whereas CORBA targets legacy applications.

00:00:55.910 --> 00:00:58.625
They all also differ in terms of their development environments.

00:00:58.625 --> 00:01:03.790
J(2)EE uses WebSphere, which is the commercial version of Eclipse.

00:01:03.790 --> 00:01:06.570
And .NET uses Visual Studio .NET.

00:01:06.570 --> 00:01:12.320
As far as protocols are concerned, Java and CORBA support IIOP and XML.

00:01:12.320 --> 00:01:15.650
Java supports, also supports RMI.

00:01:15.650 --> 00:01:18.290
COM and CLR support DCOM.

00:01:18.290 --> 00:01:19.890
And CLR supports XML and SOAP.
