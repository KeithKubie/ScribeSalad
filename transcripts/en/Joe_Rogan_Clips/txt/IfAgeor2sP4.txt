Speaker 1:          00:00          I'm in this level of murder that's happened a lot of parts of Latin American now. It's crazy. But in these areas is in as what he talked to other people who are just on the edge of this or have family members involved in this and it's just they're living this, I mean, these are levels of violence and it's interesting to compare historically these levels of violence. Um, because you look at some of the worst cities like San Pedro Sula on Doris Caracas, um, Ciudad Juarez and these are places which have levels of violence, which are like way worse than medieval Europe. A lot of places in medieval Europe, I mean, look at the figures per hundred thousand because some of them have over a hundred, a hundred thousand, 150, 100,000 and met Eva Europe Lot. These cities were like 20 per hundred thousand. So they're way worse than that. Way Worse than the wild west than like now there are some place in the United States that de la, oh, an idea.

Speaker 1:          00:52          And I've done some research recently in Baltimore, Maryland and I was kind of, it's interesting to compare that to Latin America and that's a high level. That's 40 a hundred thousands that's not as the same level, but it's significant. Still more than medieval Europe. Yeah. Wow. Baltimore's worse than Medieval Europe. Yeah. I'm an advocate. You have to have to some professors then they weren't in a like you get like, you know, they might be, they might say, well Jerusalem in this time or in a line I let you got to try and free. Nice. Hard to know. Really dig down. Exactly. And that there was outbreaks of violence and killing in certain places. The overall average of all the average year, that's a significant leap. 100% leap. Yeah, yeah, absolutely. Yeah. Baltimore. What about South side of Chicago? It's not that, I mean like the level I think in Chicago comes out around 20 or something, so it's not now the Emerg that of the host city.

Speaker 1:          01:44          Now these again, and one of the things about the violence in the United States compared to Latin America in Baltimore is, is, is, is significant bits of fairly, well, the city of Baltimore is a fairly small place where they're talking about, so in Mexico you have entire states that are like really violent or entire countries in Latin America, whereas in the U s it tends to be neighborhoods which are violent. Um, so if you really focus on the south side of Chicago, it's probably similar levels to Baltimore then United, sir. But if you look at the whole city, you've got neighbors that are pretty safe in Chicago as well.
