00:00:01.010 --> 00:00:05.979
In 2007 a sinkhole formed in Guatemala deep
enough to hold two Statue's of Liberty.

00:00:05.979 --> 00:00:10.100
And the Kimberly Diamond Mine took more than
40 years to make, and is the deepest hole

00:00:10.100 --> 00:00:12.510
ever dug by hand.

00:00:12.510 --> 00:00:17.500
But, are these the biggest and best holes
of all time? To find out more, all aboard

00:00:17.500 --> 00:00:20.890
the BOAT.

00:00:20.890 --> 00:00:24.590
Drainage holes like these help evacuate water
when it gets dangerously close to the top

00:00:24.590 --> 00:00:28.970
of a dam or a road. Now, normally, they look
like this, but when the water level rises,

00:00:28.970 --> 00:00:31.449
they become giant holes in the earth.

00:00:31.449 --> 00:00:36.440
When the ground around a drilling rig in Darvaza
Turkmenistan collapsed, geologists lit the

00:00:36.440 --> 00:00:40.719
earth's leaking gas on fire so it wouldn't
spread to villages. They thought it would

00:00:40.719 --> 00:00:46.409
run out of fuel in a few hours, but, today,
40 years later, this fiery hole now known

00:00:46.409 --> 00:00:49.879
as "The Door to Hell" continues to burn.

00:00:49.879 --> 00:00:55.489
But we've been closer to Hell. The Kola Superdeep
Borehole in Russia is the deepest hole mankind

00:00:55.489 --> 00:01:01.690
has ever drilled. It reaches down 7.6 miles
and was abandoned when scientists found that

00:01:01.690 --> 00:01:08.180
temperatures that far down are nearly twice
as hot as expected, almost 400 degrees fahrenheit.

00:01:08.180 --> 00:01:11.890
Abandoned boreholes are pretty freaky, especially
when people can just go right up to them and

00:01:11.890 --> 00:01:18.890
throw rocks down them for a very, very long
fall.

00:01:23.610 --> 00:01:28.600
Devil's Kettle was fictionalized in "Jennifer's
Body," but its bizarreness is very real. In

00:01:28.600 --> 00:01:34.560
Minnesota, a river is split in two, and half of
the river disappears down a sinkhole. What's

00:01:34.560 --> 00:01:39.190
nuts is that, to this day, no one knows where
the water goes, or where the Devil's Kettle

00:01:39.190 --> 00:01:44.140
leads. Colorful dyes and other objects dropped
into it have never been found again.

00:01:44.140 --> 00:01:46.390
But let's talk about pretty holes.

00:01:46.390 --> 00:01:51.580
Blue Holes: These underwater sinkholes go
down nearly vertically and the largest, Dean's

00:01:51.580 --> 00:01:57.030
Blue Hole in the Bahamas, is great for diving
and plunges more than two Football field lengths,

00:01:57.030 --> 00:01:58.210
straight down.

00:01:58.210 --> 00:02:03.700
I leave you with Trypophobia: The fear of
holes. It's a natural human instinct that

00:02:03.700 --> 00:02:09.849
make things like Lotus Seed Pods look icky,
and photoshops like this terrifying.

00:02:09.849 --> 00:02:14.069
