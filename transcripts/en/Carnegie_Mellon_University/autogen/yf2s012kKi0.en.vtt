trendy and I think we came to the

00:21:02.130 --> 00:21:02.140
trendy and I think we came to the
 

00:21:02.140 --> 00:21:04.500
trendy and I think we came to the
conclusion that global warming is a

00:21:04.500 --> 00:21:04.510
conclusion that global warming is a
 

00:21:04.510 --> 00:21:06.750

public perception was changing we felt

00:21:10.110 --> 00:21:10.120
public perception was changing we felt
 

00:21:10.120 --> 00:21:12.210
public perception was changing we felt
like it wasn't completely popular with

00:21:12.210 --> 00:21:12.220
like it wasn't completely popular with
 

00:21:12.220 --> 00:21:13.680

00:35:26.740 --> 00:35:28.829
so I think the Olympic Committee knows
how we feel and I think the Olympic

00:35:28.829 --> 00:35:28.839

so in this election one of the big
issues is health care and of course

00:38:22.930 --> 00:38:22.940
issues is health care and of course
 

00:38:22.940 --> 00:38:24.609
issues is health care and of course
you're one of the largest producers of

00:38:24.609 --> 00:38:24.619
you're one of the largest producers of
 

00:38:24.619 --> 00:38:26.230
you're one of the largest producers of
health care equipment and also a major

00:38:26.230 --> 00:38:26.240
health care equipment and also a major
 

00:38:26.240 --> 00:38:28.330

00:38:32.620 --> 00:38:32.630
could just broaden it a little bit you
 

00:38:32.630 --> 00:38:33.730
could just broaden it a little bit you
know what I would say is that there's

00:38:33.730 --> 00:38:33.740
know what I would say is that there's
 

00:38:33.740 --> 00:38:37.150
know what I would say is that there's
two fundamental debates in this election

00:38:37.150 --> 00:38:37.160
two fundamental debates in this election
 

00:38:37.160 --> 00:38:40.270
two fundamental debates in this election
one is clearly national defense or act

00:38:40.270 --> 00:38:40.280
one is clearly national defense or act
 

00:38:40.280 --> 00:38:41.770
one is clearly national defense or act
things like that I have no particular

00:38:41.770 --> 00:38:41.780
things like that I have no particular
 

00:38:41.780 --> 00:38:44.890
things like that I have no particular
expertise so I put that on one side the

00:38:44.890 --> 00:38:44.900
expertise so I put that on one side the
 

00:38:44.900 --> 00:38:45.640
expertise so I put that on one side the
other one I think is broadly

00:38:45.640 --> 00:38:45.650
other one I think is broadly
 

00:38:45.650 --> 00:38:48.370
other one I think is broadly
competitiveness and how will the u.s.

00:38:48.370 --> 00:38:48.380
competitiveness and how will the u.s.
 

00:38:48.380 --> 00:38:51.160
competitiveness and how will the u.s.
compete in an increasingly global world

00:38:51.160 --> 00:38:51.170
compete in an increasingly global world
 

00:38:51.170 --> 00:38:52.750
compete in an increasingly global world
and how can we make people self

00:38:52.750 --> 00:38:52.760
and how can we make people self
 

00:38:52.760 --> 00:38:55.870
and how can we make people self
confident that we can compete and I

00:38:55.870 --> 00:38:55.880
confident that we can compete and I
 

00:38:55.880 --> 00:38:57.730
confident that we can compete and I
think and broadly competitiveness that's

00:38:57.730 --> 00:38:57.740
think and broadly competitiveness that's
 

00:38:57.740 --> 00:38:59.920
think and broadly competitiveness that's
about education it's about healthcare

00:38:59.920 --> 00:38:59.930
about education it's about healthcare
 

00:38:59.930 --> 00:39:02.200
about education it's about healthcare
it's about energy policy and I think

00:39:02.200 --> 00:39:02.210
it's about energy policy and I think
 

00:39:02.210 --> 00:39:03.820
it's about energy policy and I think
it's about tax policy that encourages

00:39:03.820 --> 00:39:03.830
it's about tax policy that encourages
 

00:39:03.830 --> 00:39:08.349
it's about tax policy that encourages
innovation so you know I think in health

00:39:08.349 --> 00:39:08.359
innovation so you know I think in health
 

00:39:08.359 --> 00:39:10.599
innovation so you know I think in health

00:39:10.599 --> 00:39:10.609
care is probably of those four yet again
 

00:39:10.609 --> 00:39:12.130
care is probably of those four yet again
maybe the most complex role they're all

00:39:12.130 --> 00:39:12.140
maybe the most complex role they're all
 

00:39:12.140 --> 00:39:15.520
maybe the most complex role they're all
complex in their own way and you know I

00:39:15.520 --> 00:39:15.530
complex in their own way and you know I
 

00:39:15.530 --> 00:39:17.080
complex in their own way and you know I
think I think health care broadly

00:39:17.080 --> 00:39:17.090
think I think health care broadly
 

00:39:17.090 --> 00:39:21.340
think I think health care broadly
speaking is about 14% of the u.s. GDP

00:39:21.340 --> 00:39:21.350
speaking is about 14% of the u.s. GDP
 

00:39:21.350 --> 00:39:25.330
speaking is about 14% of the u.s. GDP
it's it's growing roughly 10% a year and

00:39:25.330 --> 00:39:25.340
it's it's growing roughly 10% a year and
 

00:39:25.340 --> 00:39:27.720
it's it's growing roughly 10% a year and
if you look at the bow wave of

00:39:27.720 --> 00:39:27.730
if you look at the bow wave of
 

00:39:27.730 --> 00:39:30.580
if you look at the bow wave of
demographics that are coming through in

00:39:30.580 --> 00:39:30.590
demographics that are coming through in
 

00:39:30.590 --> 00:39:32.830
demographics that are coming through in
terms of how long people are going to

00:39:32.830 --> 00:39:32.840
terms of how long people are going to
 

00:39:32.840 --> 00:39:35.230
terms of how long people are going to
live and how long the people that are

00:39:35.230 --> 00:39:35.240
live and how long the people that are
 

00:39:35.240 --> 00:39:36.780
live and how long the people that are
living are gonna be on the government

00:39:36.780 --> 00:39:36.790
living are gonna be on the government
 

00:39:36.790 --> 00:39:40.690
living are gonna be on the government
dole if you will it's a big challenge as

00:39:40.690 --> 00:39:40.700
dole if you will it's a big challenge as
 

00:39:40.700 --> 00:39:43.120
dole if you will it's a big challenge as
you go forward I would hope in the next

00:39:43.120 --> 00:39:43.130
you go forward I would hope in the next
 

00:39:43.130 --> 00:39:45.580
you go forward I would hope in the next
administration that they could take on

00:39:45.580 --> 00:39:45.590
administration that they could take on
 

00:39:45.590 --> 00:39:46.930
administration that they could take on
you know and it's it's one of these

00:39:46.930 --> 00:39:46.940
you know and it's it's one of these
 

00:39:46.940 --> 00:39:49.660
you know and it's it's one of these
things that you know like when I was a

00:39:49.660 --> 00:39:49.670
things that you know like when I was a
 

00:39:49.670 --> 00:39:51.099
things that you know like when I was a
student you know occasionally you like

00:39:51.099 --> 00:39:51.109
student you know occasionally you like
 

00:39:51.109 --> 00:39:56.800
student you know occasionally you like
in physics I would study a problem and I

00:39:56.800 --> 00:39:56.810
in physics I would study a problem and I
 

00:39:56.810 --> 00:39:58.270
in physics I would study a problem and I
would just walk away from it because was

00:39:58.270 --> 00:39:58.280
would just walk away from it because was
 

00:39:58.280 --> 00:40:00.280
would just walk away from it because was
too hard I'd say well see what the

00:40:00.280 --> 00:40:00.290
too hard I'd say well see what the
 

00:40:00.290 --> 00:40:01.720
too hard I'd say well see what the
professor has to say about this one

00:40:01.720 --> 00:40:01.730
professor has to say about this one
 

00:40:01.730 --> 00:40:03.790
professor has to say about this one
tomorrow you know healthcare is kind

00:40:03.790 --> 00:40:03.800
tomorrow you know healthcare is kind
 

00:40:03.800 --> 00:40:06.340
tomorrow you know healthcare is kind
that way you look at it and there's so

00:40:06.340 --> 00:40:06.350
that way you look at it and there's so
 

00:40:06.350 --> 00:40:09.190
that way you look at it and there's so
many interdependencies I think what I

00:40:09.190 --> 00:40:09.200
many interdependencies I think what I
 

00:40:09.200 --> 00:40:11.410
many interdependencies I think what I
would like to see happen is we've got to

00:40:11.410 --> 00:40:11.420
would like to see happen is we've got to
 

00:40:11.420 --> 00:40:13.180
would like to see happen is we've got to
do something about the uninsured mm-hmm

00:40:13.180 --> 00:40:13.190
do something about the uninsured mm-hmm
 

00:40:13.190 --> 00:40:16.150
do something about the uninsured mm-hmm
whoever becomes president in no.9 it's

00:40:16.150 --> 00:40:16.160
whoever becomes president in no.9 it's
 

00:40:16.160 --> 00:40:19.570
whoever becomes president in no.9 it's
just it's just it's it adds cost it

00:40:19.570 --> 00:40:19.580
just it's just it's it adds cost it
 

00:40:19.580 --> 00:40:21.970
just it's just it's it adds cost it
doesn't take cost away it's a it's the

00:40:21.970 --> 00:40:21.980
doesn't take cost away it's a it's the
 

00:40:21.980 --> 00:40:23.530
doesn't take cost away it's a it's the
wrong thing for our country and we have

00:40:23.530 --> 00:40:23.540
wrong thing for our country and we have
 

00:40:23.540 --> 00:40:25.720
wrong thing for our country and we have
to do something about that I think we

00:40:25.720 --> 00:40:25.730
to do something about that I think we
 

00:40:25.730 --> 00:40:26.950
to do something about that I think we
have to do something about the

00:40:26.950 --> 00:40:26.960
have to do something about the
 

00:40:26.960 --> 00:40:30.400
have to do something about the
transparency of quality metrics and have

00:40:30.400 --> 00:40:30.410
transparency of quality metrics and have
 

00:40:30.410 --> 00:40:33.790
transparency of quality metrics and have
reimbursement follow quality in terms of

00:40:33.790 --> 00:40:33.800
reimbursement follow quality in terms of
 

00:40:33.800 --> 00:40:36.340
reimbursement follow quality in terms of
outcomes and that has to be broadly

00:40:36.340 --> 00:40:36.350
outcomes and that has to be broadly
 

00:40:36.350 --> 00:40:39.130
outcomes and that has to be broadly
accepted you know into the system and

00:40:39.130 --> 00:40:39.140
accepted you know into the system and
 

00:40:39.140 --> 00:40:41.980
accepted you know into the system and
that I you know in anybody that's ever

00:40:41.980 --> 00:40:41.990
that I you know in anybody that's ever
 

00:40:41.990 --> 00:40:44.620
that I you know in anybody that's ever
run a company of any kind says as

00:40:44.620 --> 00:40:44.630
run a company of any kind says as
 

00:40:44.630 --> 00:40:46.720
run a company of any kind says as
quality gets better cost goes down and

00:40:46.720 --> 00:40:46.730
quality gets better cost goes down and
 

00:40:46.730 --> 00:40:48.970
quality gets better cost goes down and
the only industry I've ever been a part

00:40:48.970 --> 00:40:48.980
the only industry I've ever been a part
 

00:40:48.980 --> 00:40:50.530
the only industry I've ever been a part
of it doesn't measure quality

00:40:50.530 --> 00:40:50.540
of it doesn't measure quality
 

00:40:50.540 --> 00:40:52.480
of it doesn't measure quality
fundamentally in process quality's

00:40:52.480 --> 00:40:52.490
fundamentally in process quality's
 

00:40:52.490 --> 00:40:53.380
fundamentally in process quality's
health care yeah

00:40:53.380 --> 00:40:53.390
health care yeah
 

00:40:53.390 --> 00:40:55.870
health care yeah
so I think we have to do something about

00:40:55.870 --> 00:40:55.880
so I think we have to do something about
 

00:40:55.880 --> 00:40:58.450
so I think we have to do something about
that I think we have to do something

00:40:58.450 --> 00:40:58.460
that I think we have to do something
 

00:40:58.460 --> 00:41:01.000
that I think we have to do something
about getting information technology

00:41:01.000 --> 00:41:01.010
about getting information technology
 

00:41:01.010 --> 00:41:04.510
about getting information technology
broadly into the system we've got to do

00:41:04.510 --> 00:41:04.520
broadly into the system we've got to do
 

00:41:04.520 --> 00:41:06.730
broadly into the system we've got to do
something that modernizes the FDA and

00:41:06.730 --> 00:41:06.740
something that modernizes the FDA and
 

00:41:06.740 --> 00:41:09.040
something that modernizes the FDA and
makes both new technology get to market

00:41:09.040 --> 00:41:09.050
makes both new technology get to market
 

00:41:09.050 --> 00:41:11.350
makes both new technology get to market
faster but have a way to measure its

00:41:11.350 --> 00:41:11.360
faster but have a way to measure its
 

00:41:11.360 --> 00:41:13.840
faster but have a way to measure its
efficacy and we have to have some form

00:41:13.840 --> 00:41:13.850
efficacy and we have to have some form
 

00:41:13.850 --> 00:41:16.750
efficacy and we have to have some form
of tort reform and so what I would hope

00:41:16.750 --> 00:41:16.760
of tort reform and so what I would hope
 

00:41:16.760 --> 00:41:18.280
of tort reform and so what I would hope
is that the next president kind of step

00:41:18.280 --> 00:41:18.290
is that the next president kind of step
 

00:41:18.290 --> 00:41:20.350
is that the next president kind of step
you know you can look at Governor

00:41:20.350 --> 00:41:20.360
you know you can look at Governor
 

00:41:20.360 --> 00:41:21.910
you know you can look at Governor
Romney's plan of Massachusetts you could

00:41:21.910 --> 00:41:21.920
Romney's plan of Massachusetts you could
 

00:41:21.920 --> 00:41:23.920
Romney's plan of Massachusetts you could
look at Governor Schwarzenegger as plan

00:41:23.920 --> 00:41:23.930
look at Governor Schwarzenegger as plan
 

00:41:23.930 --> 00:41:25.360
look at Governor Schwarzenegger as plan
of California there's a there's a bunch

00:41:25.360 --> 00:41:25.370
of California there's a there's a bunch
 

00:41:25.370 --> 00:41:27.070
of California there's a there's a bunch
of plans of being involved I think all

00:41:27.070 --> 00:41:27.080
of plans of being involved I think all
 

00:41:27.080 --> 00:41:29.980
of plans of being involved I think all
of them have constructive aspects to it

00:41:29.980 --> 00:41:29.990
of them have constructive aspects to it
 

00:41:29.990 --> 00:41:31.750
of them have constructive aspects to it
and you know I just think whether it's a

00:41:31.750 --> 00:41:31.760
and you know I just think whether it's a
 

00:41:31.760 --> 00:41:33.940
and you know I just think whether it's a
Republican or Democrat we need to take

00:41:33.940 --> 00:41:33.950
Republican or Democrat we need to take
 

00:41:33.950 --> 00:41:36.520
Republican or Democrat we need to take
on a couple of these elements and get

00:41:36.520 --> 00:41:36.530
on a couple of these elements and get
 

00:41:36.530 --> 00:41:38.920
on a couple of these elements and get
them going forward now the last thing I

00:41:38.920 --> 00:41:38.930
them going forward now the last thing I
 

00:41:38.930 --> 00:41:43.770
them going forward now the last thing I
would say is health care in this country

00:41:43.770 --> 00:41:43.780
would say is health care in this country
 

00:41:43.780 --> 00:41:47.260
would say is health care in this country
is one of our best industries in other

00:41:47.260 --> 00:41:47.270
is one of our best industries in other
 

00:41:47.270 --> 00:41:48.490
is one of our best industries in other
words if all you did is read the

00:41:48.490 --> 00:41:48.500
words if all you did is read the
 

00:41:48.500 --> 00:41:49.840
words if all you did is read the
newspaper every day not the USA Today

00:41:49.840 --> 00:41:49.850
newspaper every day not the USA Today
 

00:41:49.850 --> 00:41:52.900
newspaper every day not the USA Today
but let's say the New York Times you'd

00:41:52.900 --> 00:41:52.910
but let's say the New York Times you'd
 

00:41:52.910 --> 00:41:56.320
but let's say the New York Times you'd
say that after you read the USA Today

00:41:56.320 --> 00:41:56.330
say that after you read the USA Today
 

00:41:56.330 --> 00:41:58.150
say that after you read the USA Today
you know you'd come to the conclusion

00:41:58.150 --> 00:41:58.160
you know you'd come to the conclusion
 

00:41:58.160 --> 00:42:00.730
you know you'd come to the conclusion
that every other industry in the United

00:42:00.730 --> 00:42:00.740
that every other industry in the United
 

00:42:00.740 --> 00:42:03.190
that every other industry in the United
States is great and the one that's

00:42:03.190 --> 00:42:03.200
States is great and the one that's
 

00:42:03.200 --> 00:42:04.860
States is great and the one that's
Horrible's our health care industry

00:42:04.860 --> 00:42:04.870
Horrible's our health care industry
 

00:42:04.870 --> 00:42:07.270
Horrible's our health care industry
because it cost too much and it's

00:42:07.270 --> 00:42:07.280
because it cost too much and it's
 

00:42:07.280 --> 00:42:08.980
because it cost too much and it's
putting this horrible burden on the

00:42:08.980 --> 00:42:08.990
putting this horrible burden on the
 

00:42:08.990 --> 00:42:10.720
putting this horrible burden on the
country you know health care is one of

00:42:10.720 --> 00:42:10.730
country you know health care is one of
 

00:42:10.730 --> 00:42:12.520
country you know health care is one of
the few export industries we have as a

00:42:12.520 --> 00:42:12.530
the few export industries we have as a
 

00:42:12.530 --> 00:42:15.520
the few export industries we have as a
country it's a place where look if we if

00:42:15.520 --> 00:42:15.530
country it's a place where look if we if
 

00:42:15.530 --> 00:42:16.980
country it's a place where look if we if
we do it right

00:42:16.980 --> 00:42:16.990
we do it right
 

00:42:16.990 --> 00:42:19.320
we do it right
I live to be a hundred China will never

00:42:19.320 --> 00:42:19.330
I live to be a hundred China will never
 

00:42:19.330 --> 00:42:21.780
I live to be a hundred China will never
catch us in health care and so we

00:42:21.780 --> 00:42:21.790
catch us in health care and so we
 

00:42:21.790 --> 00:42:24.660
catch us in health care and so we
shouldn't dismember this important

00:42:24.660 --> 00:42:24.670
shouldn't dismember this important
 

00:42:24.670 --> 00:42:27.270
shouldn't dismember this important
industry just because we get demagogued

00:42:27.270 --> 00:42:27.280
industry just because we get demagogued
 

00:42:27.280 --> 00:42:29.550
industry just because we get demagogued
and and things like that so I you know

00:42:29.550 --> 00:42:29.560
and and things like that so I you know
 

00:42:29.560 --> 00:42:31.770
and and things like that so I you know
as you as you plot your way through the

00:42:31.770 --> 00:42:31.780
as you as you plot your way through the
 

00:42:31.780 --> 00:42:33.450
as you as you plot your way through the
next election I think that's what's

00:42:33.450 --> 00:42:33.460
next election I think that's what's
 

00:42:33.460 --> 00:42:36.630
next election I think that's what's
something we got to keep in mind so now

00:42:36.630 --> 00:42:36.640
something we got to keep in mind so now
 

00:42:36.640 --> 00:42:37.890
something we got to keep in mind so now
that we've talked about healthcare let's

00:42:37.890 --> 00:42:37.900
that we've talked about healthcare let's
 

00:42:37.900 --> 00:42:40.200
that we've talked about healthcare let's
get to something really important how

00:42:40.200 --> 00:42:40.210
get to something really important how
 

00:42:40.210 --> 00:42:41.580
get to something really important how
long do you think the writers strike in

00:42:41.580 --> 00:42:41.590
long do you think the writers strike in
 

00:42:41.590 --> 00:42:48.240
long do you think the writers strike in
Hollywood you know it's a it's a it the

00:42:48.240 --> 00:42:48.250
