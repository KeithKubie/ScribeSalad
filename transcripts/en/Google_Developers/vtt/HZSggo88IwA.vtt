MARTIN OMANDER: Hey, my name
is Martin Omander.

00:00:08.340 --> 00:00:11.700
And I'm here with you for Google
Root Access, the show

00:00:11.700 --> 00:00:14.460
on Google Developers Live
about startups.

00:00:14.460 --> 00:00:17.900
And I'm joined today by Don
Dodge, long-time investor and

00:00:17.900 --> 00:00:19.920
startup advocate.

00:00:19.920 --> 00:00:23.010
Don, we did a show a couple
of weeks ago about, how do

00:00:23.010 --> 00:00:25.100
venture capitalists think?

00:00:25.100 --> 00:00:26.910
And we got a question--

00:00:26.910 --> 00:00:29.270
so you talked about revenue
is important.

00:00:29.270 --> 00:00:32.020
You have to show revenue
to your investors.

00:00:32.020 --> 00:00:38.030
And we got a viewer writing in
and saying, but is revenue

00:00:38.030 --> 00:00:39.050
really that important?

00:00:39.050 --> 00:00:42.445
It took five years for Google
to start getting revenues.

00:00:42.445 --> 00:00:44.460
DON DODGE: Yeah, that's
a good question.

00:00:44.460 --> 00:00:49.180
It really depends on the
investment climate at the time

00:00:49.180 --> 00:00:50.900
that you're starting
your company.

00:00:50.900 --> 00:00:54.430
And over the past 20 years, I've
seen the climate change

00:00:54.430 --> 00:00:59.520
from being able to raise money
on just a business plan or a

00:00:59.520 --> 00:01:03.970
PowerPoint presentation to
swinging to where you had to

00:01:03.970 --> 00:01:08.350
have users and growth and
initial revenue and your

00:01:08.350 --> 00:01:10.180
revenue model proved out.

00:01:10.180 --> 00:01:14.820
So it depends on the investment

00:01:14.820 --> 00:01:16.840
climate at the time.

00:01:16.840 --> 00:01:21.890
Now in the case of Google,
Google started in 1997, I

00:01:21.890 --> 00:01:24.840
think, something like
that-- '97, '98--

00:01:24.840 --> 00:01:30.790
and didn't generate revenue
until sometime in 2000 or a

00:01:30.790 --> 00:01:32.490
little later.

00:01:32.490 --> 00:01:36.410
In that time period, that was
an acceptable thing to do.

00:01:36.410 --> 00:01:40.980
However, in any time frame,
you have to demonstrate

00:01:40.980 --> 00:01:47.010
innovation, growth, maybe even
hypergrowth, with a path

00:01:47.010 --> 00:01:51.910
towards profitability, with a
idea of what your revenue

00:01:51.910 --> 00:01:54.000
model will be.

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:58.120
And depending on the time frame,
you either have to

00:01:58.120 --> 00:02:02.300
prove that out or just have
it as an idea, and

00:02:02.300 --> 00:02:03.520
people will fund it.

00:02:03.520 --> 00:02:05.400
In the case of Google,
there was

00:02:05.400 --> 00:02:07.560
tremendous innovation happening.

00:02:07.560 --> 00:02:11.390
And they understood that
eventually they would be able

00:02:11.390 --> 00:02:13.900
to monetize the audience.

00:02:13.900 --> 00:02:16.580
And of course, it worked
out very well.

00:02:16.580 --> 00:02:18.670
Today the pendulum has swung.

00:02:18.670 --> 00:02:24.720
And I see at Y Combinator and
TechStars, companies working

00:02:24.720 --> 00:02:28.990
on much smaller ideas that
generate revenue quickly.

00:02:28.990 --> 00:02:30.650
They're more
business-to-business type

00:02:30.650 --> 00:02:34.680
ideas than the sort of consumer
or social-oriented

00:02:34.680 --> 00:02:38.110
ideas that take much longer
to get to profit.

00:02:38.110 --> 00:02:41.410
So it all depends on the
investment climate in which

00:02:41.410 --> 00:02:42.270
you're starting.

00:02:42.270 --> 00:02:46.390
MARTIN OMANDER: So you have to
balance cash flow against

00:02:46.390 --> 00:02:48.930
innovation and sort of strike
the right balance.

00:02:48.930 --> 00:02:50.310
Is that the way to
think about it?

00:02:50.310 --> 00:02:50.700
DON DODGE: Right.

00:02:50.700 --> 00:02:55.030
So on an earlier show, we had
Alex Moore, from Baydin, on.

00:02:55.030 --> 00:02:58.790
And he went to cash
flow break even

00:02:58.790 --> 00:03:01.140
directly from angel money.

00:03:01.140 --> 00:03:03.810
So he was able to raise a little
bit of angel money that

00:03:03.810 --> 00:03:07.710
gave him 12 months or 18 months
of runway and move

00:03:07.710 --> 00:03:10.790
immediately to a revenue model
that got him to cash flow

00:03:10.790 --> 00:03:11.950
break even.

00:03:11.950 --> 00:03:14.760
And he never did raise
money from VCs.

00:03:14.760 --> 00:03:19.310
So if you have the type of
product that can do that, then

00:03:19.310 --> 00:03:20.910
you probably should.

00:03:20.910 --> 00:03:23.400
But you need to recognize
early on, is this a

00:03:23.400 --> 00:03:29.120
hypergrowth, viral kind of
product, or is it a steady

00:03:29.120 --> 00:03:31.990
growth kind of profitable
product?

00:03:31.990 --> 00:03:36.380
And then you need to adjust
your business model, your

00:03:36.380 --> 00:03:42.180
growth plans, and how you
attract investors accordingly.

00:03:42.180 --> 00:03:43.940
So you need to really understand
what kind of a

00:03:43.940 --> 00:03:46.320
product and what kind of company
you're building.

00:03:46.320 --> 00:03:49.510
Match that up with the investors
who care about that.

00:03:49.510 --> 00:03:50.980
MARTIN OMANDER: Hm, I see.

00:03:50.980 --> 00:03:54.780
And on that note, matching
up with the investors--

00:03:54.780 --> 00:03:56.670
investors, I guess, are
different in different parts

00:03:56.670 --> 00:03:57.650
of the world.

00:03:57.650 --> 00:04:02.480
What if you're a startup outside
Silicon Valley, where

00:04:02.480 --> 00:04:04.730
the VC environment is
very different.

00:04:04.730 --> 00:04:08.510
Should you then focus on
innovation or cash flow or

00:04:08.510 --> 00:04:09.550
something else?

00:04:09.550 --> 00:04:11.470
DON DODGE: Well, that's
a good question.

00:04:11.470 --> 00:04:15.790
So it depends on the timing
and investment climate.

00:04:15.790 --> 00:04:17.779
And those climates
can be different.

00:04:17.779 --> 00:04:20.850
For example, the investment
climate in Silicon Valley, the

00:04:20.850 --> 00:04:22.350
answer to that question
is obvious.

00:04:22.350 --> 00:04:28.710
You focus on hypergrowth and
build users and customers as

00:04:28.710 --> 00:04:32.320
quickly as possible, and that
will attract more investment.

00:04:32.320 --> 00:04:35.170
And the idea is that eventually,
you can flip the

00:04:35.170 --> 00:04:37.800
switch and monetize
that audience.

00:04:37.800 --> 00:04:40.670
So that's been the sort of
operating model in Silicon

00:04:40.670 --> 00:04:43.580
Valley for a long time.

00:04:43.580 --> 00:04:46.320
In other parts of the world,
investors are more

00:04:46.320 --> 00:04:50.240
conservative, and they want
to see the more--

00:04:50.240 --> 00:04:53.480
like the Baydin model, where
you bootstrap building the

00:04:53.480 --> 00:04:57.255
product, you get your initial
customers, you get to cash

00:04:57.255 --> 00:05:00.970
flow break even, you prove out
your model, and then they'll

00:05:00.970 --> 00:05:05.980
give you investment capital
to expand that growth.

00:05:05.980 --> 00:05:10.060
So the risk is much lower, but
the returns are also lower.

00:05:10.060 --> 00:05:15.860
So investors that have that kind
of mentality want to see

00:05:15.860 --> 00:05:19.890
that business model proven out,
initial customers, and

00:05:19.890 --> 00:05:21.500
then they'll give you money.

00:05:21.500 --> 00:05:23.690
So I guess you have to balance
a couple of things.

00:05:23.690 --> 00:05:27.070
You have to balance, what is the
investment climate like?

00:05:27.070 --> 00:05:28.700
What is the timing like?

00:05:28.700 --> 00:05:31.870
And then, if you're in different
parts of the world

00:05:31.870 --> 00:05:36.110
where the investors are more
conservative, then you have to

00:05:36.110 --> 00:05:39.980
take a more steady growth kind
of approach and prove out the

00:05:39.980 --> 00:05:44.700
model and innovate at the
speed at which you can

00:05:44.700 --> 00:05:46.190
generate profit.

00:05:46.190 --> 00:05:49.780
So it's profit-driven innovation
rather than

00:05:49.780 --> 00:05:52.605
innovation driving the
growth and profit.

00:05:52.605 --> 00:05:55.510
MARTIN OMANDER: And learning
how the investors where you

00:05:55.510 --> 00:05:59.640
are, learning how they think,
that requires networking,

00:05:59.640 --> 00:06:03.620
hanging out with them long
before you actually go and ask

00:06:03.620 --> 00:06:04.595
them for money, I assume.

00:06:04.595 --> 00:06:05.570
DON DODGE: Absolutely.

00:06:05.570 --> 00:06:07.850
So it works both ways.

00:06:07.850 --> 00:06:11.430
Taking the Silicon Valley
hypergrowth, fast-growth

00:06:11.430 --> 00:06:14.670
approach with investors in other
parts of the world is

00:06:14.670 --> 00:06:16.700
probably not going to work.

00:06:16.700 --> 00:06:24.070
And taking the slow growth kind
of less-risk ideas is not

00:06:24.070 --> 00:06:26.910
going to work with Silicon
Valley VCs, because they want

00:06:26.910 --> 00:06:32.260
to see $100 billion companies,
and they want to see 10 to 20

00:06:32.260 --> 00:06:33.530
times their money.

00:06:33.530 --> 00:06:35.860
You're not going to get
that from a more

00:06:35.860 --> 00:06:37.010
conservative approach.

00:06:37.010 --> 00:06:42.070
So you have to balance the type
of business you have and

00:06:42.070 --> 00:06:45.520
the investment climate that
you're in and sort of set up

00:06:45.520 --> 00:06:48.470
your business model and growth
plans accordingly.

00:06:48.470 --> 00:06:49.710
MARTIN OMANDER: Great.

00:06:49.710 --> 00:06:50.740
Thank you very much, Don.

00:06:50.740 --> 00:06:52.210
DON DODGE: Thank you.

00:06:52.210 --> 00:06:55.570
MARTIN OMANDER: So I'm a
developer, and I love

00:06:55.570 --> 00:06:57.820
developing on the Google
Cloud Platform.

00:06:57.820 --> 00:07:01.540
