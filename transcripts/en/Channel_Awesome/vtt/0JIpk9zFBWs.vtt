00:00:12.809 --> 00:00:17.299
Let's take a look at Cadet Kelly. Yeah, it's pretty obvious

00:00:17.300 --> 00:00:21.680
I'm not the target demographic for this film. But for the target demographic,

00:00:21.840 --> 00:00:23.840
I think this is a perfectly serviceable

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:25.410
little flick. An

00:00:25.410 --> 00:00:31.189
artsy little free spirit likes to hang with her divorced mom and dad, but gets a little surprise when she finds out that her mom

00:00:31.189 --> 00:00:35.389
is getting remarried to Gary Cole, playing the role of, oh my god,

00:00:35.390 --> 00:00:41.930
I think he's just called Sir. Do we ever know his real name? Let me IMDB that. Oh my god, he's just called Sir!

00:00:42.780 --> 00:00:45.710
Anyway, as you probably can tell from that name,

00:00:45.710 --> 00:00:47.810
he takes the military very seriously.

00:00:47.810 --> 00:00:51.529
So not only does Kelly have to move away from her school of alternative learning,

00:00:51.530 --> 00:00:57.710
you know, where they sit on beanbags and can do assignments whenever they want, and you know, one of those super liberal schools, and

00:00:57.840 --> 00:00:59.840
suddenly has to go to boot camp.

00:01:00.030 --> 00:01:06.079
Honestly, it's not made entirely clear why. I guess because the stepdad is there?

00:01:06.600 --> 00:01:10.100
Or maybe she got in trouble a lot? Well, it doesn't look like it.

00:01:10.100 --> 00:01:16.550
I don't know. The focus is on Kelly trying to adapt with her drill sergeant, Jessica, played by Kim Possible star Christy Romano.

00:01:16.800 --> 00:01:22.069
She of course doesn't fit in, claiming that her old school was a lot different and everybody's too rough.

00:01:22.070 --> 00:01:24.800
Why, it's almost like this is military school or something.

00:01:24.860 --> 00:01:27.340
But through a lot of goof-ups, understandings, and

00:01:27.460 --> 00:01:33.160
misunderstandings, she'll figure out there really is something to all this strictness. And her mother and stepdad will also figure out

00:01:33.170 --> 00:01:37.010
how to adapt to a changing world. On the surface, this sounds pretty generic.

00:01:37.590 --> 00:01:38.960
And yeah, a good chunk of the time,

00:01:38.960 --> 00:01:44.540
it is. But there are little touches that make it stand out a little bit more from this kind of story you've heard a million times.

00:01:44.729 --> 00:01:47.419
For example, I like that she comes from this really

00:01:47.640 --> 00:01:53.760
open school where they do, like, arts and crafts and are super gentle. That makes a much better contrast and

00:01:53.860 --> 00:01:57.800
understanding of why she doesn't fit in. The family dilemma is also interesting, too.

00:01:57.930 --> 00:02:04.459
The father is strict and sometimes says the wrong things, but he's by no means a bad guy. He, like Kelly, is trying to understand

00:02:04.460 --> 00:02:08.360
what's the best route to take in terms of this family, and is totally identifiable.

00:02:08.360 --> 00:02:10.909
I also like how nobody is 100 percent right or

00:02:11.129 --> 00:02:13.548
100 percent wrong. Kelly does get in a lot of trouble,

00:02:13.549 --> 00:02:15.549
and she's properly punished for it,

00:02:15.599 --> 00:02:20.149
resulting in emotional scenes that a lot of time kind of feel genuine. When Hilary Duff cries,

00:02:20.150 --> 00:02:23.980
it feels like she's really crying. And when the parents look confused or screwed up,

00:02:23.980 --> 00:02:26.199
you can tell it means a lot when they did something wrong.

00:02:26.480 --> 00:02:33.519
There are definitely problems, though, and a lot of them center around the Jessica character. Christy Romano is a very talented actress.

00:02:33.520 --> 00:02:36.100
I just don't think she was the right pick for this part.

00:02:36.200 --> 00:02:39.400
This is supposed to be someone tough, controlling, and in charge.

00:02:39.400 --> 00:02:44.620
And she just kind of looks like she's trying to play a role of someone being tough, controlling, and in charge.

00:02:44.750 --> 00:02:48.880
She just kind of seems snooty and pissed off, not really commanding authority.

00:02:48.880 --> 00:02:52.480
And I get it, Kelly's supposed to wear her down and get to her humanity.

00:02:52.480 --> 00:02:57.069
But she just doesn't feel like a genuinely intimidating character that needs to be softened up.

00:02:57.260 --> 00:03:02.319
There's also some strange issues with Kelly and her hitting on the same boy. And even at the end,

00:03:02.320 --> 00:03:03.460
he doesn't really choose

00:03:03.460 --> 00:03:10.269
which one he's gonna go with. And I don't know, it's more uncomfortable than charming. And yes, by the way, that is Iceman, or boy.

00:03:10.700 --> 00:03:14.289
And yeah, like I said. I never really got why she's going to military school.

00:03:14.290 --> 00:03:15.820
I don't know if I missed something,

00:03:15.820 --> 00:03:19.959
but I feel like that's kind of a big decision and should probably be made very clear

00:03:19.960 --> 00:03:24.909
why this is happening, seeing how it's the whole focus of the film. But again, you could argue

00:03:24.910 --> 00:03:30.639
that it's not really the film's intent. Its intent is trying to show a girl adapting to this new world and, to its credit,

00:03:30.770 --> 00:03:33.760
making this new world seem different, but also impressive.

00:03:33.760 --> 00:03:39.189
We've seen movies like Stripes where the goofballs go to boot camp and all sorts of crazy things happen.

00:03:39.190 --> 00:03:44.380
And oh, isn't that zany? But I like that this film looks like it legitimately respects the military.

00:03:44.480 --> 00:03:50.859
There's a lot of impressive marching and techniques, and they look legitimately disciplined and even cool while doing it.

00:03:51.050 --> 00:03:53.469
Well, except the final number in the competition.

00:03:53.470 --> 00:03:54.070
I don't know,

00:03:54.070 --> 00:03:58.809
they're building this up as, like, a big deal, and they have to work together in order for this to work,

00:03:58.810 --> 00:04:05.890
and they need passion and inspiration. And what, they can use ribbons now and play pop songs? And even if that's true,

00:04:05.890 --> 00:04:11.080
it's edited in such a way that they play scenes twice or speed it up and then slow it down. And that's really

00:04:11.300 --> 00:04:16.989
cheating, and it looks lame. The scenes before were so impressive. Why did you have to dumb it down like this? I don't know,

00:04:16.989 --> 00:04:20.168
Maybe they didn't have time to rehearse it well enough so that it looked incredible.

00:04:20.169 --> 00:04:22.899
But I felt like this was a cheap way out. However,

00:04:22.900 --> 00:04:26.500
I do big-time give credit to the ending. Without giving too much away,

00:04:26.540 --> 00:04:32.290
not everything wraps up in a neat little bow. I really like it when a kid's film shows not everything is 100 percent

00:04:32.810 --> 00:04:34.689
happily ever after. Shit happens,

00:04:34.689 --> 00:04:38.289
you have to deal with it. And you know what? You still count your blessings and look on the bright side.

00:04:38.300 --> 00:04:42.819
I think that's a better message than, always do your best and everything will always turn out your way.

00:04:43.069 --> 00:04:47.438
So yeah, would I put this on again? No. Would I check it out a first time? Probably not.

00:04:47.439 --> 00:04:53.229
But for an adult who had to sit through this, I think it gets across the right messages. Sometimes subtle, sometimes too on-the-nose,

00:04:53.509 --> 00:04:55.868
Cadet Kelly passes with okay colors.
