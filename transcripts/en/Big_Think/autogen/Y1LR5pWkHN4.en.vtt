to it diagnosis is difficult there is an

to it diagnosis is difficult there is an
 

00:00:27.300 --> 00:00:28.939
to it diagnosis is difficult there is an
adequate means for diagnosis and

00:00:28.939 --> 00:00:28.949
adequate means for diagnosis and
 

00:00:28.949 --> 00:00:31.759
adequate means for diagnosis and
treatment is not universally available

00:00:31.759 --> 00:00:31.769
treatment is not universally available
 

00:00:31.769 --> 00:00:34.250
treatment is not universally available
so people are dying it's impacting

00:00:34.250 --> 00:00:34.260
so people are dying it's impacting
 

00:00:34.260 --> 00:00:35.660
so people are dying it's impacting
livelihoods throughout the world this is

00:00:35.660 --> 00:00:35.670
livelihoods throughout the world this is
 

00:00:35.670 --> 00:00:37.610
livelihoods throughout the world this is
one of our most important public health

00:00:37.610 --> 00:00:37.620
one of our most important public health
 

00:00:37.620 --> 00:00:40.549
one of our most important public health
crises of our time really is malaria in

00:00:40.549 --> 00:00:40.559
crises of our time really is malaria in
 

00:00:40.559 --> 00:00:42.100
crises of our time really is malaria in
the case of malaria there was some

00:00:42.100 --> 00:00:42.110
the case of malaria there was some
 

00:00:42.110 --> 00:00:44.209
the case of malaria there was some
interesting information that was out

00:00:44.209 --> 00:00:44.219
interesting information that was out
 

00:00:44.219 --> 00:00:46.790
interesting information that was out
there that there was a parasite just

00:00:46.790 --> 00:00:46.800
there that there was a parasite just
 

00:00:46.800 --> 00:00:49.130
there that there was a parasite just
like the major human malaria parasite

00:00:49.130 --> 00:00:49.140
like the major human malaria parasite
 

00:00:49.140 --> 00:00:51.229
like the major human malaria parasite
falciparum plasmodium falciparum that

00:00:51.229 --> 00:00:51.239
falciparum plasmodium falciparum that
 

00:00:51.239 --> 00:00:53.029
falciparum plasmodium falciparum that
was in chimpanzees but there was only

00:00:53.029 --> 00:00:53.039
was in chimpanzees but there was only
 

00:00:53.039 --> 00:00:54.439
was in chimpanzees but there was only
one example of this and so people

00:00:54.439 --> 00:00:54.449
one example of this and so people
 

00:00:54.449 --> 00:00:56.000
one example of this and so people
weren't really able to say too much

00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:56.010
weren't really able to say too much
 

00:00:56.010 --> 00:00:58.069
weren't really able to say too much
about the relationship of this parasite

00:00:58.069 --> 00:00:58.079
about the relationship of this parasite
 

00:00:58.079 --> 00:01:00.080
about the relationship of this parasite
called Plasmodium reckon owie and the

00:01:00.080 --> 00:01:00.090
called Plasmodium reckon owie and the
 

00:01:00.090 --> 00:01:01.729
called Plasmodium reckon owie and the
human malaria parasite which was the

00:01:01.729 --> 00:01:01.739
human malaria parasite which was the
 

00:01:01.739 --> 00:01:03.529
human malaria parasite which was the
most deadly one plasmodium falciparum

00:01:03.529 --> 00:01:03.539
most deadly one plasmodium falciparum
 

00:01:03.539 --> 00:01:06.370
most deadly one plasmodium falciparum
and so basically what we did along with

00:01:06.370 --> 00:01:06.380
and so basically what we did along with
 

00:01:06.380 --> 00:01:09.020
and so basically what we did along with
colleagues at the rubber Koch Institute

00:01:09.020 --> 00:01:09.030
colleagues at the rubber Koch Institute
 

00:01:09.030 --> 00:01:11.060
colleagues at the rubber Koch Institute
and at University of Massachusetts

00:01:11.060 --> 00:01:11.070
and at University of Massachusetts
 

00:01:11.070 --> 00:01:13.789
and at University of Massachusetts
Amherst as we went out and we actually

00:01:13.789 --> 00:01:13.799
Amherst as we went out and we actually
 

00:01:13.799 --> 00:01:16.789
Amherst as we went out and we actually
looked in chimpanzees and we tried to

00:01:16.789 --> 00:01:16.799
looked in chimpanzees and we tried to
 

00:01:16.799 --> 00:01:18.830
looked in chimpanzees and we tried to
find evidence this parasite and we were

00:01:18.830 --> 00:01:18.840
find evidence this parasite and we were
 

00:01:18.840 --> 00:01:20.719
find evidence this parasite and we were
surprised that whether it was in cote

00:01:20.719 --> 00:01:20.729
surprised that whether it was in cote
 

00:01:20.729 --> 00:01:22.370
surprised that whether it was in cote
divoire in cameroon we were actually

00:01:22.370 --> 00:01:22.380
divoire in cameroon we were actually
 

00:01:22.380 --> 00:01:24.260
divoire in cameroon we were actually
able to find chimpanzees were infected

00:01:24.260 --> 00:01:24.270
able to find chimpanzees were infected
 

00:01:24.270 --> 00:01:27.620
able to find chimpanzees were infected
with this parasite

00:01:27.620 --> 00:01:27.630
 

00:01:27.630 --> 00:01:30.230
for me the sort of the the real aha

00:01:30.230 --> 00:01:30.240
for me the sort of the the real aha
 

00:01:30.240 --> 00:01:32.630
for me the sort of the the real aha
moment was recognizing wow these these

00:01:32.630 --> 00:01:32.640
moment was recognizing wow these these
 

00:01:32.640 --> 00:01:34.429
moment was recognizing wow these these
parasites are out there in chimpanzees

00:01:34.429 --> 00:01:34.439
parasites are out there in chimpanzees
 

00:01:34.439 --> 00:01:36.319
parasites are out there in chimpanzees
one of the things i started to convince

00:01:36.319 --> 00:01:36.329
one of the things i started to convince
 

00:01:36.329 --> 00:01:38.359
one of the things i started to convince
myself of was that perhaps you know

00:01:38.359 --> 00:01:38.369
myself of was that perhaps you know
 

00:01:38.369 --> 00:01:40.039
myself of was that perhaps you know
because i assume people would be out

00:01:40.039 --> 00:01:40.049
because i assume people would be out
 

00:01:40.049 --> 00:01:41.419
because i assume people would be out
there looking for these things so if

00:01:41.419 --> 00:01:41.429
there looking for these things so if
 

00:01:41.429 --> 00:01:42.590
there looking for these things so if
they hadn't found him i figured they

00:01:42.590 --> 00:01:42.600
they hadn't found him i figured they
 

00:01:42.600 --> 00:01:44.480
they hadn't found him i figured they
must be very rare and the answer was

00:01:44.480 --> 00:01:44.490
must be very rare and the answer was
 

00:01:44.490 --> 00:01:46.039
must be very rare and the answer was
really people just were not out there

00:01:46.039 --> 00:01:46.049
really people just were not out there
 

00:01:46.049 --> 00:01:47.389
really people just were not out there
looking for them and i think that was

00:01:47.389 --> 00:01:47.399
looking for them and i think that was
 

00:01:47.399 --> 00:01:49.690
looking for them and i think that was
one of the sort of aha moments for me

00:01:49.690 --> 00:01:49.700
one of the sort of aha moments for me
 

00:01:49.700 --> 00:01:51.710
one of the sort of aha moments for me
but but the other thing to point out is

00:01:51.710 --> 00:01:51.720
but but the other thing to point out is
 

00:01:51.720 --> 00:01:53.359
but but the other thing to point out is
that this kind of science is hugely

00:01:53.359 --> 00:01:53.369
that this kind of science is hugely
 

00:01:53.369 --> 00:01:55.219
that this kind of science is hugely
collaborative so the number of aha

00:01:55.219 --> 00:01:55.229
collaborative so the number of aha
 

00:01:55.229 --> 00:01:57.649
collaborative so the number of aha
moments and sort of Eureka moments in

00:01:57.649 --> 00:01:57.659
moments and sort of Eureka moments in
 

00:01:57.659 --> 00:01:59.120
moments and sort of Eureka moments in
the science there was a bunch of them so

00:01:59.120 --> 00:01:59.130
the science there was a bunch of them so
 

00:01:59.130 --> 00:02:00.919
the science there was a bunch of them so
there was that one there was also the

00:02:00.919 --> 00:02:00.929
there was that one there was also the
 

00:02:00.929 --> 00:02:03.169
there was that one there was also the
work in in dr. Steve riches lab at

00:02:03.169 --> 00:02:03.179
work in in dr. Steve riches lab at
 

00:02:03.179 --> 00:02:04.539
work in in dr. Steve riches lab at
University of Massachusetts Amherst

00:02:04.539 --> 00:02:04.549
University of Massachusetts Amherst
 

00:02:04.549 --> 00:02:08.749
University of Massachusetts Amherst
where he actually saw sequence from

00:02:08.749 --> 00:02:08.759
where he actually saw sequence from
 

00:02:08.759 --> 00:02:09.889
where he actually saw sequence from
these sorts of things and put them

00:02:09.889 --> 00:02:09.899
these sorts of things and put them
 

00:02:09.899 --> 00:02:12.289
these sorts of things and put them
together and realized lo and behold all

00:02:12.289 --> 00:02:12.299
together and realized lo and behold all
 

00:02:12.299 --> 00:02:14.660
together and realized lo and behold all
of the diversity of humanities is held

00:02:14.660 --> 00:02:14.670
of the diversity of humanities is held
 

00:02:14.670 --> 00:02:17.839
of the diversity of humanities is held
within the the sort of broader diversity

00:02:17.839 --> 00:02:17.849
within the the sort of broader diversity
 

00:02:17.849 --> 00:02:19.880
within the the sort of broader diversity
of these parasites and chimpanzees and

00:02:19.880 --> 00:02:19.890
of these parasites and chimpanzees and
 

00:02:19.890 --> 00:02:21.890
of these parasites and chimpanzees and
that really was like we sat down at a

00:02:21.890 --> 00:02:21.900
that really was like we sat down at a
 

00:02:21.900 --> 00:02:24.259
that really was like we sat down at a
table and looked at this data and we

00:02:24.259 --> 00:02:24.269
table and looked at this data and we
 

00:02:24.269 --> 00:02:25.580
table and looked at this data and we
were like you know what there's no way

00:02:25.580 --> 00:02:25.590
were like you know what there's no way
 

00:02:25.590 --> 00:02:27.530
were like you know what there's no way
to interpret this other than really

00:02:27.530 --> 00:02:27.540
to interpret this other than really
 

00:02:27.540 --> 00:02:28.699
to interpret this other than really
being the movement of a chimpanzee

00:02:28.699 --> 00:02:28.709
being the movement of a chimpanzee
 

00:02:28.709 --> 00:02:31.520
being the movement of a chimpanzee
parasite into humans and you know of

00:02:31.520 --> 00:02:31.530
parasite into humans and you know of
 

00:02:31.530 --> 00:02:32.960
parasite into humans and you know of
course we sort of looked at each other

00:02:32.960 --> 00:02:32.970
course we sort of looked at each other
 

00:02:32.970 --> 00:02:37.039
course we sort of looked at each other
and and and it was it was pretty it was

00:02:37.039 --> 00:02:37.049
and and and it was it was pretty it was
 

00:02:37.049 --> 00:02:40.700
and and and it was it was pretty it was
a pretty incredible moment

00:02:40.700 --> 00:02:40.710
 

00:02:40.710 --> 00:02:44.750
as a young kid I remember vividly and I

00:02:44.750 --> 00:02:44.760
as a young kid I remember vividly and I
 

00:02:44.760 --> 00:02:46.010
as a young kid I remember vividly and I
must have been probably four or five

00:02:46.010 --> 00:02:46.020
must have been probably four or five
 

00:02:46.020 --> 00:02:48.140
must have been probably four or five
years old and I was watching I'm pretty

00:02:48.140 --> 00:02:48.150
years old and I was watching I'm pretty
 

00:02:48.150 --> 00:02:49.570
years old and I was watching I'm pretty
sure it was National Geographic

00:02:49.570 --> 00:02:49.580
sure it was National Geographic
 

00:02:49.580 --> 00:02:53.690
sure it was National Geographic
documentary with my father on work that

00:02:53.690 --> 00:02:53.700
documentary with my father on work that
 

00:02:53.700 --> 00:02:57.770
documentary with my father on work that
was done with wild gorillas in in

00:02:57.770 --> 00:02:57.780
was done with wild gorillas in in
 

00:02:57.780 --> 00:03:00.500
was done with wild gorillas in in
central Africa and that's sort of the

00:03:00.500 --> 00:03:00.510
central Africa and that's sort of the
 

00:03:00.510 --> 00:03:03.530
central Africa and that's sort of the
the most of my recollection that I have

00:03:03.530 --> 00:03:03.540
the most of my recollection that I have
 

00:03:03.540 --> 00:03:04.990
the most of my recollection that I have
but I remember just being sort of

00:03:04.990 --> 00:03:05.000
but I remember just being sort of
 

00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:07.460
but I remember just being sort of
incredibly fascinated with the idea that

00:03:07.460 --> 00:03:07.470
incredibly fascinated with the idea that
 

00:03:07.470 --> 00:03:09.950
incredibly fascinated with the idea that
these you know that these animals were

00:03:09.950 --> 00:03:09.960
these you know that these animals were
 

00:03:09.960 --> 00:03:12.370
these you know that these animals were
some of our closest living relatives and

00:03:12.370 --> 00:03:12.380
some of our closest living relatives and
 

00:03:12.380 --> 00:03:14.840
some of our closest living relatives and
I think that was at least for me the

00:03:14.840 --> 00:03:14.850
I think that was at least for me the
 

00:03:14.850 --> 00:03:18.380
I think that was at least for me the
first sort of sense i had at the the

00:03:18.380 --> 00:03:18.390
first sort of sense i had at the the
 

00:03:18.390 --> 00:03:20.060
first sort of sense i had at the the
sort of wonder that we have the

00:03:20.060 --> 00:03:20.070
sort of wonder that we have the
 

00:03:20.070 --> 00:03:21.650
sort of wonder that we have the
potential to have with scientific

00:03:21.650 --> 00:03:21.660
potential to have with scientific
 

00:03:21.660 --> 00:03:23.360
potential to have with scientific
inquiry to change the way that we think

00:03:23.360 --> 00:03:23.370
inquiry to change the way that we think
 

00:03:23.370 --> 00:03:26.000
inquiry to change the way that we think
about the world and to grasp insights

00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:26.010
about the world and to grasp insights
 

00:03:26.010 --> 00:03:28.700
about the world and to grasp insights
that sort of afterwards appear somewhat

00:03:28.700 --> 00:03:28.710
that sort of afterwards appear somewhat
 

00:03:28.710 --> 00:03:31.160
that sort of afterwards appear somewhat
obvious but beforehand are you know are

00:03:31.160 --> 00:03:31.170
obvious but beforehand are you know are
 

00:03:31.170 --> 00:03:33.650
obvious but beforehand are you know are
really quite opaque and basically how

00:03:33.650 --> 00:03:33.660
really quite opaque and basically how
 

00:03:33.660 --> 00:03:35.240
really quite opaque and basically how
that information can change the way that

00:03:35.240 --> 00:03:35.250
that information can change the way that
 

00:03:35.250 --> 00:03:36.920
that information can change the way that
we think about ourselves and ultimately

00:03:36.920 --> 00:03:36.930
we think about ourselves and ultimately
 

00:03:36.930 --> 00:03:40.150
we think about ourselves and ultimately
empower us

00:03:40.150 --> 00:03:40.160
 

00:03:40.160 --> 00:03:42.310
by studying these things and obviously

00:03:42.310 --> 00:03:42.320
by studying these things and obviously
 

00:03:42.320 --> 00:03:44.050
by studying these things and obviously
