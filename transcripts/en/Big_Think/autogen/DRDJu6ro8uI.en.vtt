nurturing is very focused and
detail-oriented activity and so when

00:01:56.349 --> 00:01:56.359
detail-oriented activity and so when
 

00:01:56.359 --> 00:01:58.749
detail-oriented activity and so when
people perform tasks after looking at

00:01:58.749 --> 00:01:58.759

pictures of baby animals they actually

00:02:01.510 --> 00:02:01.520
pictures of baby animals they actually
 

00:02:01.520 --> 00:02:03.099
pictures of baby animals they actually
found that they were more attentive to

00:02:03.099 --> 00:02:03.109
found that they were more attentive to
 

00:02:03.109 --> 00:02:05.440
found that they were more attentive to
detail and more conscientious in the

00:02:05.440 --> 00:02:05.450
detail and more conscientious in the
 

00:02:05.450 --> 00:02:08.080
detail and more conscientious in the
tasks that they did so this might be

00:02:08.080 --> 00:02:08.090
tasks that they did so this might be
 

00:02:08.090 --> 00:02:11.020
tasks that they did so this might be
another way to both improve performance

00:02:11.020 --> 00:02:11.030
another way to both improve performance
 

00:02:11.030 --> 00:02:13.449
another way to both improve performance
but also bring a little bit of joy to

00:02:13.449 --> 00:02:13.459
but also bring a little bit of joy to
 

00:02:13.459 --> 00:02:15.220
but also bring a little bit of joy to
the work space I do this in my own work

00:02:15.220 --> 00:02:15.230
the work space I do this in my own work
 

00:02:15.230 --> 00:02:17.080

a lot of joy and maybe it also helps me

00:02:23.290 --> 00:02:23.300
a lot of joy and maybe it also helps me
 

00:02:23.300 --> 00:02:26.490
a lot of joy and maybe it also helps me
catch errors in my writing

00:02:26.490 --> 00:02:26.500
