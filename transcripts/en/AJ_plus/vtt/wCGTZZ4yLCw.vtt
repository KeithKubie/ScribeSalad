00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.720
IT’S ELECTION SEASON SO LISTEN UP!

00:00:02.720 --> 00:00:05.520
This is the most important election in our lifetime.

00:00:05.520 --> 00:00:08.060
I mean, definitely mine, but probably so many other people’s as well.

00:00:08.060 --> 00:00:11.860
Every single election is portrayed as the most important election of all time.

00:00:11.860 --> 00:00:14.300
I will say, for the 2018 midterm elections,

00:00:14.300 --> 00:00:17.440
it really is the most important election of all time.

00:00:17.440 --> 00:00:18.700
Yes, the midterms,

00:00:18.700 --> 00:00:22.660
they fall between every presidential election, and we got one coming up.

00:00:22.660 --> 00:00:26.000
The media generally portrays midterms as the day Americans have a chance

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:27.780
to send the guy in the White House a message:

00:00:27.780 --> 00:00:29.800
either this finger or this finger.

00:00:29.800 --> 00:00:34.200
But on November 6th, there’s SO much more you’re voting for that affects your everyday life,

00:00:34.200 --> 00:00:36.940
more than any Russian collusion or pee-pee tape

00:00:36.940 --> 00:00:38.520
or the latest, dumbest tweet.

00:00:38.520 --> 00:00:40.740
[sighs] I’m still on covfefe.

00:00:40.740 --> 00:00:43.520
Hey guys, I’m Kate, and this Sunday I’m giving you a cheat sheet

00:00:43.520 --> 00:00:46.320
on the various things you might be voting for this November 6th,

00:00:46.320 --> 00:00:49.520
from attorney general to senator to water board,

00:00:52.860 --> 00:00:55.300
So his that subscribe button and let’s get into it.

00:00:55.400 --> 00:00:58.280
You’ve probably heard about the so-called blue wave,

00:00:58.280 --> 00:01:01.320
in which Democrats are predicted to take back a bunch of seats in the midterm elections

00:01:01.320 --> 00:01:03.860
because President Trump is …

00:01:03.860 --> 00:01:05.340
not a popular person.

00:01:05.340 --> 00:01:08.100
Well, there's no wave if there’s no voters,

00:01:08.100 --> 00:01:12.060
and traditionally, midterms are where democracy goes to die.

00:01:12.320 --> 00:01:18.160
In the last midterm election, in 2014, the U.S. had the lowest voter turnout in 70 years.

00:01:18.160 --> 00:01:21.680
In fact, look at this graph on voting rates since 1990.

00:01:21.680 --> 00:01:24.760
These peaks are turnout rates during presidential elections.

00:01:24.760 --> 00:01:26.760
And these valleys are midterms.

00:01:26.760 --> 00:01:30.520
It’s basically a doomsday graph in the shape of Bart Simpson’s haircut.

00:01:31.160 --> 00:01:32.800
Coincidentally, Bart Simpson ...

00:01:33.780 --> 00:01:35.600
probably doesn’t vote in the midterms, either.

00:01:35.600 --> 00:01:39.980
The people that DO vote tend to be older, whiter and Republican-er.

00:01:39.980 --> 00:01:42.840
And when it comes to 2018, a recent survey found

00:01:42.840 --> 00:01:46.640
that only 28% of young people said they would certainly vote.

00:01:46.640 --> 00:01:47.800
You guys ...

00:01:47.800 --> 00:01:52.460
When voter turnout is low, it just means that people who don't have our same interests,

00:01:52.460 --> 00:01:57.020
who don't have our same agenda and who don't have our same vision for our communities

00:01:57.020 --> 00:01:58.940
are making decisions on your behalf.

00:01:58.940 --> 00:02:02.300
Oh, and don’t forget, everyone’s ballot out there is going to be a little bit different

00:02:02.300 --> 00:02:06.640
depending on where you live, so consider this video a primer for future elections, too.

00:02:06.640 --> 00:02:11.480
OK, let’s start with your national offices: First, the U.S. House of Representatives.

00:02:11.480 --> 00:02:15.000
These are the people that represent your congressional district on Capitol Hill.

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:18.680
In November, no matter where you live, you will be voting on a U.S. rep.

00:02:18.680 --> 00:02:22.500
Every single one of the 435 districts are up for a vote.

00:02:22.500 --> 00:02:26.700
For Democrats to win control of the House, only about two dozen need to flip

00:02:26.700 --> 00:02:30.340
– and these districts, some say, are on track to do so.

00:02:30.340 --> 00:02:31.720
So why should you care?

00:02:31.720 --> 00:02:35.200
Well, the U.S. House of Representatives is the chamber that begins

00:02:35.200 --> 00:02:37.600
~*~*IMPEACHMENT PROCEEDINGS*~*~

00:02:37.600 --> 00:02:40.280
But more importantly, the House passes federal laws.

00:02:40.280 --> 00:02:44.420
And for the last two years, Trump has had his way with a majority Republican House.

00:02:44.420 --> 00:02:47.020
So with a different party in control than the president,

00:02:47.020 --> 00:02:50.540
his policy wish list, like tax reform and military spending,

00:02:50.540 --> 00:02:52.700
wouldn’t necessarily be an automatic pass.

00:02:53.240 --> 00:02:56.140
And also, whichever party is in control sets the agenda.

00:02:56.520 --> 00:02:59.420
Well, there are so many laws, so many easy laws

00:02:59.420 --> 00:03:05.560
that our representatives in Congress can pass and can put forth to be discussed and debated.

00:03:05.560 --> 00:03:08.940
The people that you decide to put in Congress right now, they’re going to decide our lives

00:03:08.940 --> 00:03:11.420
for the next however many years they’re in office.

00:03:11.520 --> 00:03:12.660
Then we have senators.

00:03:12.920 --> 00:03:16.360
Thirty-three states will be holding U.S. Senate elections in November.

00:03:16.360 --> 00:03:21.320
And experts think Tennessee and Texas could elect their first Democratic senators in decades,

00:03:21.320 --> 00:03:24.700
and that seats in Missouri and Florida could flip to Republicans.

00:03:24.700 --> 00:03:25.820
Why does that matter?

00:03:25.820 --> 00:03:27.900
Because senators also pass laws,

00:03:27.900 --> 00:03:31.700
and they also are the ones that confirm nominees to the cabinet and the Supreme Court.

00:03:31.700 --> 00:03:34.480
[siren]

00:03:34.620 --> 00:03:36.780
They also deal with possible ...

00:03:36.780 --> 00:03:38.440
~*~*IMPEACHMENT PROCEEDINGS*~*~.

00:03:38.440 --> 00:03:42.760
Cool. So those are the federal races, and those are ones that are covered a lot in the mainstream media.

00:03:42.760 --> 00:03:46.020
But the reality is, these lawmakers’ day-to-day actions

00:03:46.020 --> 00:03:48.240
don’t usually affect your day-to-day lives.

00:03:48.240 --> 00:03:50.040
That’s where state officials come in.

00:03:50.040 --> 00:03:51.480
First, you got your governors.

00:03:51.480 --> 00:03:54.480
Thirty-six states will hold election for governors on November 6th.

00:03:54.480 --> 00:03:58.380
And whether it’s union-busting in Wisconsin or slashing healthcare in Iowa,

00:03:58.380 --> 00:04:02.060
every state’s election is happening on the backdrop of some pretty important issues.

00:04:02.060 --> 00:04:06.600
“Here in the state of California, currently you have two candidates, one Democrat, one Republican,

00:04:06.600 --> 00:04:09.120
who have opposing views on immigration.

00:04:09.120 --> 00:04:12.340
And if you look at what happened in California over the last couple of years,

00:04:12.340 --> 00:04:16.300
we were the state that provided driver’s licenses to undocumented immigrants,

00:04:16.300 --> 00:04:19.720
we were also the state that provided in-state tuition for undocumented residents

00:04:19.720 --> 00:04:24.460
and now, as of this past year, we are now officially a sanctuary state.

00:04:24.460 --> 00:04:28.400
I'm super excited about Stacey Abrams in Georgia,

00:04:28.400 --> 00:04:34.820
who will be the first black woman to ever serve as governor in the entire U.S.

00:04:34.820 --> 00:04:39.940
Stacey Abrams wants to make sure that we dismantle the ways in which black people

00:04:39.940 --> 00:04:44.020
are being overcriminalized in Georgia's criminal justice system.

00:04:44.020 --> 00:04:49.000
The race that I'm most excited for right now is the governor race in Florida, definitely.

00:04:49.040 --> 00:04:52.380
Andrew Gillum has been with us from the start, Parkland.

00:04:52.380 --> 00:04:56.200
Then there’s the state legislatures. 2018 is a big year for these races,

00:04:56.200 --> 00:04:58.840
because 82% of those seats are up for a vote,

00:04:58.840 --> 00:05:04.980
and state lawmakers are the people that set your state’s agenda on things like marijuana, abortion, the budget

00:05:05.000 --> 00:05:07.880
or whether or not it’s illegal to throw poop out of a moving car

00:05:07.880 --> 00:05:10.400
which is a real law in the state of Oregon, for some reason.

00:05:11.360 --> 00:05:13.160
Illinois, where Chicago is,

00:05:13.160 --> 00:05:15.940
there are really strict gun laws.

00:05:15.940 --> 00:05:20.000
But in the states around Illinois, there are not strict gun laws.

00:05:20.000 --> 00:05:24.540
So a lot of the guns that come into Chicago and cause the gun violence there

00:05:24.540 --> 00:05:27.840
come from the states around them with lax gun laws.

00:05:27.840 --> 00:05:34.680
So if you can influence your state legislature to put gun reform laws in place in your state,

00:05:34.680 --> 00:05:38.940
then you make your state a safer place, and therefore states around you a safer place.

00:05:38.940 --> 00:05:42.700
Before we go to more local races, let’s do one more state-level office

00:05:42.700 --> 00:05:45.840
you probably haven’t thought a lot about: state attorney general.

00:05:45.840 --> 00:05:47.560
Thirty of them will be voted on this November.

00:05:47.560 --> 00:05:51.060
Attorneys general are the top legal officer in every state,

00:05:51.060 --> 00:05:52.940
often called the people’s lawyer.

00:05:52.940 --> 00:05:58.760
They work on everything from environmental laws, labor protection, consumer rights and, perhaps most notably,

00:05:58.900 --> 00:06:00.800
they deal with criminal justice.

00:06:00.800 --> 00:06:05.580
They get to decide where money goes in relationship to policing and police,

00:06:05.580 --> 00:06:09.540
but they also get to determine what is criminal,

00:06:09.600 --> 00:06:12.800
what is not criminal, what the sentencing guidelines are.

00:06:12.860 --> 00:06:17.620
While we’re on the topic of police reform, let’s go more local and go to county sheriffs.

00:06:17.620 --> 00:06:24.060
The sheriff oversees what's happening with police and law enforcement in your county.

00:06:24.120 --> 00:06:27.300
That's, like, really the community you live in.

00:06:27.300 --> 00:06:29.900
And how your sheriff chooses to work with ICE

00:06:29.900 --> 00:06:34.300
says a lot about whether your community is resisting or carrying out deportations.

00:06:34.420 --> 00:06:37.340
The sanctuary state bill that was recently passed in California

00:06:37.340 --> 00:06:42.960
essentially said that the state was not going to use any of its state or local resources to cooperate with ICE.

00:06:42.960 --> 00:06:48.960
Certain sheriffs across the state have complained that this new bill has made their jobs difficult.

00:06:48.960 --> 00:06:54.080
You have to ask yourself as a voter, do I want this person representing me?

00:06:54.080 --> 00:06:59.200
And do I want this person leading the charge in making sure that my community is safe?

00:06:59.200 --> 00:07:01.380
District attorneys and prosecutors are next.

00:07:01.380 --> 00:07:03.380
They are the attorneys that represent the government,

00:07:03.380 --> 00:07:06.940
and you probably have heard of them in the context of police brutality,

00:07:06.940 --> 00:07:11.080
specifically when they choose not to file charges against officers that shoot people.

00:07:11.080 --> 00:07:15.020
Listen to how Alicia Garza says that she realized the importance of DAs

00:07:15.020 --> 00:07:17.240
when she was protesting police violence.

00:07:17.240 --> 00:07:23.240
We were arrested and we were charged with issues related to civil disobedience.

00:07:23.260 --> 00:07:27.000
Even though a district attorney may have been obscure to us before,

00:07:27.000 --> 00:07:31.480
it became very clear to us when we were at the mercy of the district attorney.

00:07:31.600 --> 00:07:35.160
Finally, let’s talk about an office you probably didn’t know existed,

00:07:35.160 --> 00:07:36.180
the Water Board.

00:07:36.340 --> 00:07:43.380
You look at those Water Board seats – people whose job is essentially to bring water into the community,

00:07:43.540 --> 00:07:44.700
and how to manage it –

00:07:44.700 --> 00:07:48.460
a large number of those seats go uncontested.

00:07:48.460 --> 00:07:51.860
If you're a voter looking to make the biggest difference possible,

00:07:51.860 --> 00:07:56.920
vote for your local Water Board person, because water is essentially a human right.

00:07:57.020 --> 00:08:00.140
There are so many more races like this we don’t have time to go into,

00:08:00.140 --> 00:08:02.280
like School Board and mayor and judge.

00:08:02.280 --> 00:08:05.720
And remember, you won’t be voting on all of these positions in November,

00:08:05.720 --> 00:08:07.660
because it depends on where you live.

00:08:07.660 --> 00:08:12.260
So check your local ballot, read up on the candidates and the issues, and remember:

00:08:12.260 --> 00:08:14.320
Don't be a Bart Simpson.

00:08:14.320 --> 00:08:16.320
So when people say that your vote doesn't matter,

00:08:16.320 --> 00:08:19.000
what I would tell them is, go talk to Dolores Huerta.

00:08:19.000 --> 00:08:22.540
Go tell John Lewis. These are two civil rights legends in our community

00:08:22.540 --> 00:08:27.780
who have shed their blood, sweat and tears just so they can go into the voting booth one day

00:08:27.780 --> 00:08:29.500
and vote for a couple of candidates,

00:08:29.500 --> 00:08:32.940
whether it’s governor, Water Board seat or School Board.

00:08:32.940 --> 00:08:35.520
