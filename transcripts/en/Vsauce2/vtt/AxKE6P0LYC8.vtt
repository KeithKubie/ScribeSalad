00:00:00.470 --> 00:00:04.330
Giant cardboard robot arms, and eyelashes
for your car.

00:00:04.330 --> 00:00:09.430
It's episode 14 of LÃ¼t.

00:00:09.430 --> 00:00:14.570
This optical mouse transforms into a mechanical
beast that can battle your pig-shaped desk

00:00:14.570 --> 00:00:15.780
vacuum.

00:00:15.780 --> 00:00:19.099
Be sure to team it up with this USB flashdrive.

00:00:19.099 --> 00:00:24.060
And here's a Chinese farmer who grows pears
inside molds so they wind up looking like

00:00:24.060 --> 00:00:25.810
little, edible Buddhas.

00:00:25.810 --> 00:00:29.949
This ax appears to be going through your wall,
but, actually, it's just perfect for hanging

00:00:29.949 --> 00:00:32.220
up keys or a coat.

00:00:32.220 --> 00:00:36.340
While you're out in the sun this summer, be
sure to wear your solar powered bikini that

00:00:36.340 --> 00:00:38.150
can charge your phone and iPod.

00:00:38.150 --> 00:00:44.210
Or, to be more formal, use these power icon
cufflinks with built-in LED's that breath

00:00:44.210 --> 00:00:46.260
like a sleeping computer.

00:00:46.260 --> 00:00:52.580
If you go to a summer BBQ, blend in by wearing
Que, a cologne that smells like spices, smoke,

00:00:52.580 --> 00:00:55.570
meat, and sweet summer sweat.

00:00:55.570 --> 00:00:59.610
And be sure to bring your host a bottle of
wine topped with the Daddy Wine Puzzle: an

00:00:59.610 --> 00:01:04.030
infuriatingly difficult puzzle to open that
locks the bottle's cork.

00:01:04.030 --> 00:01:08.670
Well, why eat boring hot dogs when you could
have a Happy Hot Dog Man?

00:01:08.670 --> 00:01:13.830
This one-move slicer gives your tube-meat
limbs and a face that you can decorate.

00:01:13.830 --> 00:01:15.040
Is that too happy?

00:01:15.040 --> 00:01:18.640
Well, roast your weenies with the Cthulhu
Skull Roaster instead.

00:01:18.640 --> 00:01:24.640
Oh, and don't forget corn, which is much more
funner as a Lightsaber corn cup.

00:01:24.640 --> 00:01:29.159
Get classy by tossing your summer salad in
this bowl that resembles a boat with oars,

00:01:29.159 --> 00:01:34.760
and, of course, if you insist on eating clean
food, you should stick with this hot dog.

00:01:34.760 --> 00:01:38.170
It's actually an artfully colored and molded
bar of soap.

00:01:38.170 --> 00:01:41.670
Finally, serve Vat 19's Unfortunate Cookies.

00:01:41.670 --> 00:01:47.330
Once the food coma sets in, blow up your necktie
like a balloon, and sleep on it like a pillow.

00:01:47.330 --> 00:01:51.440
These mugs from Neatorama give you a fun animal
nose when you drink out of them, but if you

00:01:51.440 --> 00:01:55.920
think that's all just a bunch of monkey business,
grab this mug with a built-in motor that stirs

00:01:55.920 --> 00:01:56.920
itself.

00:01:56.920 --> 00:01:59.860
As you wait, add Jesus to your morning waffles.

00:01:59.860 --> 00:02:04.540
Your breakfast, I'm sure, followed a glorious
night's rest on your girlfriend's lap-shaped

00:02:04.540 --> 00:02:05.540
pillow.

00:02:05.540 --> 00:02:10.009
Or, your Boyfriend Arm Pillow that hugs you
when no one else is around.

00:02:10.009 --> 00:02:14.750
If you're a newborn baby watching the program,
be sure to check out the Zaky: disembodied

00:02:14.750 --> 00:02:17.240
hand-pillows that cradle you...

00:02:17.240 --> 00:02:18.560
Want to be weirder?

00:02:18.560 --> 00:02:23.910
Well, take a nap at the office inside the
Ostrich: A sensory depravation sleeping sack

00:02:23.910 --> 00:02:27.980
you sling over your shoulder like a soft,
luxurious bladder.

00:02:27.980 --> 00:02:33.250
Now, something free: Instructions from Instructables
on how to turn your old, boring appliances

00:02:33.250 --> 00:02:34.780
into a VHS toaster.

00:02:34.780 --> 00:02:37.660
And, as always, thanks for watching.
