00:00:00.780 --> 00:00:04.630
&gt;&gt; From the Library of
Congress in Washington, D.C.

00:00:23.130 --> 00:00:26.690 position:56%
&gt;&gt; Good afternoon, and welcome to
the African and Middle East Division

00:00:26.690 --> 00:00:28.570
of the Library of Congress.

00:00:28.570 --> 00:00:31.470
I'm Mary-Jane Deeb, Chief of
the Division, and I'm very happy

00:00:31.470 --> 00:00:36.510
to see you all here for a
very special presentation

00:00:36.510 --> 00:00:41.650 position:56%
with Dr. Rana Al Kadi, who will talk
to us about a fascinating subject

00:00:41.650 --> 00:00:46.620
that we have not often
addressed in our lecture series,

00:00:46.620 --> 00:00:50.200
and that is Islamic architecture.

00:00:50.200 --> 00:00:54.770
This presentation is co-sponsored
with the Middle East Institute,

00:00:54.770 --> 00:01:00.760
and I would like to thank
more particularly Kate Seely,

00:01:00.760 --> 00:01:04.770
the Senior Vice President of
the Institute for suggesting

00:01:04.770 --> 00:01:07.330
that the Library of Congress
would be the ideal setting

00:01:07.330 --> 00:01:08.630
for this lecture.

00:01:08.630 --> 00:01:12.910
I was the one to thank Diedre,
who is here, and I've just met,

00:01:12.910 --> 00:01:16.230
from the Middle East
Institute, there she is,

00:01:16.230 --> 00:01:21.730
and who has organized this
program from this side

00:01:21.730 --> 00:01:23.730
of the Middle East Institute.

00:01:23.730 --> 00:01:26.330
But before we introduce
our speaker today,

00:01:26.330 --> 00:01:31.450
I would like to make my usual
commercial about our division here.

00:01:31.450 --> 00:01:36.250
As many of you know, our division
is made up of three sections.

00:01:36.250 --> 00:01:41.230
The African, the Hebraic,
and the [inaudible] sections,

00:01:41.230 --> 00:01:47.340
and we cover over-we're responsible
at least-for over 78 countries

00:01:47.340 --> 00:01:53.440
in the region including in the
whole of Africa, Central Asia,

00:01:53.440 --> 00:01:56.540
the Caucuses, and beyond.

00:01:56.540 --> 00:02:05.870
And we invite people
to use our collections,

00:02:05.870 --> 00:02:11.320
so this is a reading room,
and it is in this reading room

00:02:11.320 --> 00:02:13.590
that people will come
and do research.

00:02:13.590 --> 00:02:15.130
We're not a lending library.

00:02:15.130 --> 00:02:19.030
We're not like the public
libraries that lend out books.

00:02:19.030 --> 00:02:20.830
We collect materials.

00:02:20.830 --> 00:02:22.820
The whole library collects
materials from the whole world,

00:02:22.820 --> 00:02:25.470
in all languages, in all scripts.

00:02:25.470 --> 00:02:28.460
In fact, this division
collects materials

00:02:28.460 --> 00:02:31.780
in the vernacular-in other
words, if you're doing research

00:02:31.780 --> 00:02:38.330
on Islamic architecture, if the
materials are in Arabic or Turkish

00:02:38.330 --> 00:02:42.560
or in Persian, those
materials would be here.

00:02:42.560 --> 00:02:49.780
But if the materials that you want
are in English, French, German,

00:02:49.780 --> 00:02:53.360
or Italian, or whatever, they're
part of the general collection.

00:02:53.360 --> 00:02:58.410
So we are focused on languages,
rather than on national,

00:02:58.410 --> 00:03:01.650
political entities as such.

00:03:01.650 --> 00:03:05.090
We're very active in acquiring
and developing our collections.

00:03:05.090 --> 00:03:08.010
We're active in serving
our collections.

00:03:08.010 --> 00:03:13.680
We also, this place,
we brief people.

00:03:13.680 --> 00:03:19.170
We have groups that
come, often organized

00:03:19.170 --> 00:03:25.680 position:56%
by different organizations, or by
the International Visitor's Program,

00:03:25.680 --> 00:03:31.580
of the State Department, so we
do a great deal of interacting

00:03:31.580 --> 00:03:35.100
with people from our regions.

00:03:35.100 --> 00:03:41.650
We have had exhibits, major
exhibits, in the past few years.

00:03:41.650 --> 00:03:45.810
And we hope to have more of them.

00:03:45.810 --> 00:03:51.190
And we also invite scholars
and experts who have researched

00:03:51.190 --> 00:03:54.950
and done work in our
areas of responsibility,

00:03:54.950 --> 00:03:59.350
to share with us their
insights, and their findings.

00:03:59.350 --> 00:04:02.360
So that all of us attending
and participating

00:04:02.360 --> 00:04:06.750
in the programs leave
enriched with new information

00:04:06.750 --> 00:04:09.640
and a better understanding
of the cultures

00:04:09.640 --> 00:04:13.550
and societies whose
publications we collect.

00:04:13.550 --> 00:04:17.550
A case in point, of course,
is the scholar we have today.

00:04:17.550 --> 00:04:22.750
Dr. Al Kadi is from Saudi
Arabia, and a native of Medina.

00:04:22.750 --> 00:04:24.050
And therefore, well located

00:04:24.050 --> 00:04:29.540
to discuss this important
subject, Islamic architecture.

00:04:29.540 --> 00:04:31.690
However, there is a twist here.

00:04:31.690 --> 00:04:37.090 position:56%
Her research on Islamic architecture
has focused on the western part

00:04:37.090 --> 00:04:40.380
of the Muslim world,
on North Africa, Spain,

00:04:40.380 --> 00:04:41.960
rather than on the eastern part.

00:04:41.960 --> 00:04:44.040
At least this is my understanding.

00:04:44.040 --> 00:04:45.790
Perhaps she will correct me.

00:04:45.790 --> 00:04:51.720
And I hope that she
will tell us what it was

00:04:51.720 --> 00:04:54.860
that drew her in that direction.

00:04:54.860 --> 00:04:58.690
But now, for a fuller
introduction of Dr. Al Kadi,

00:04:58.690 --> 00:05:04.910
is our own Arab world
specialist, Dr. Muhannad Salhi.

00:05:04.910 --> 00:05:06.710
Thank you.

00:05:06.710 --> 00:05:13.200
[ Applause ]

00:05:13.200 --> 00:05:14.540
&gt;&gt; Thank you Mary-Jane.

00:05:14.540 --> 00:05:15.840
Welcome everybody.

00:05:15.840 --> 00:05:18.580
Thank you for joining us.

00:05:18.580 --> 00:05:23.710
Rana Al Kadi, a native of
Medina, began to carve her place

00:05:23.710 --> 00:05:27.060
in the world of architecture
over 15 years ago,

00:05:27.060 --> 00:05:32.050
at a time when related
jobs for women were few

00:05:32.050 --> 00:05:34.310
in the kingdom of Saudi Arabia.

00:05:34.310 --> 00:05:39.500 position:56%
In what Al Kadi describes as a major
turning point, she transitioned

00:05:39.500 --> 00:05:43.100
from a career in petroleum
to pursue her passion

00:05:43.100 --> 00:05:45.500
for architectural design.

00:05:45.500 --> 00:05:49.900
As she continued to gain
expertise in visual arts,

00:05:49.900 --> 00:05:54.390
as well as architectural planning
and interiors, Al Kadi served

00:05:54.390 --> 00:05:59.400
in the Saudi Ministry of
Foreign Affairs in Madrid, Spain.

00:05:59.400 --> 00:06:05.410
While in Madrid, she earned her PhD
from the Universidad Polytechnica,

00:06:05.410 --> 00:06:10.440
Madrid, in conservation,
and restoration

00:06:10.440 --> 00:06:13.100
of architectural heritage,

00:06:13.100 --> 00:06:17.190
with a focus on Islamic
architecture in the Muslim region.

00:06:17.190 --> 00:06:20.590
Al Kadi's travels throughout
Tunisia, Morocco,

00:06:20.590 --> 00:06:24.290
Turkey and Spain further
enriched her interactions

00:06:24.290 --> 00:06:26.960
with [inaudible] architectural
sites,

00:06:26.960 --> 00:06:30.240
inspiring her to continue
preservation and restoration work

00:06:30.240 --> 00:06:34.790
in Saudi Arabia, and her
beloved home city of Medina.

00:06:34.790 --> 00:06:38.110
Her expertise in visual
arts, architectural planning,

00:06:38.110 --> 00:06:40.880
and interiors, and conservation,

00:06:40.880 --> 00:06:48.360
has made Al Kadi a trailblazer
among Saudi women in her field.

00:06:48.360 --> 00:06:53.280
Dr. Al Kadi's research and current
work focuses on Islamic domes,

00:06:53.280 --> 00:06:57.060
and crossed arches in the
[inaudible] region, and the origins

00:06:57.060 --> 00:07:01.170
of Islamic vaults, and
the arrival in Spain

00:07:01.170 --> 00:07:05.230
and preservation intervention
in Europe.

00:07:05.230 --> 00:07:08.380
More recently, Al Kadi
has had exhibitions

00:07:08.380 --> 00:07:13.240
and private preservations projects
in historical sites and districts.

00:07:13.240 --> 00:07:17.470
Blending cultural heritage with
fresh technological elements

00:07:17.470 --> 00:07:20.160
in a perfect illustration
of her passion

00:07:20.160 --> 00:07:23.790
for meeting traditional
architecture with the contemporary.

00:07:23.790 --> 00:07:28.270
Her work offers a fresh look at
Islamic architectural elements,

00:07:28.270 --> 00:07:32.580
the bridge geographical,
region and historical contacts.

00:07:32.580 --> 00:07:37.150
Just a quick note to the audience,
while we welcome this event

00:07:37.150 --> 00:07:40.930
as being videotaped, as you
can see, so we welcome you

00:07:40.930 --> 00:07:44.930
to ask questions during the
question and answer period,

00:07:44.930 --> 00:07:47.420
but please be aware that
by asking questions,

00:07:47.420 --> 00:07:50.450
you are giving your
consent to be videotaped,

00:07:50.450 --> 00:07:52.860
and your voice will
be videotaped as well.

00:07:52.860 --> 00:07:55.630
Also we are going to
keep you busy today.

00:07:55.630 --> 00:07:58.490
There are two sets of
surveys, if you're so inclined.

00:07:58.490 --> 00:08:00.720
There is one from our
division, and there is one

00:08:00.720 --> 00:08:05.490
from the Middle East Institute,
so please feel free to fill them.

00:08:05.490 --> 00:08:08.980 position:56%
The lovely Miriam from the Middle
East Institute has left pens for you

00:08:08.980 --> 00:08:11.260
over there, if you need a pen.

00:08:11.260 --> 00:08:16.600
So please feel free to fill the
surveys, and leave them at the desk

00:08:16.600 --> 00:08:19.300
over there at the end
of the session.

00:08:19.300 --> 00:08:23.510
So, without further
adieu, Dr. Rana Al Kadi.

00:08:23.510 --> 00:08:27.130
[ Applause ]

00:08:27.130 --> 00:08:31.840
&gt;&gt; Thank you for the introduction.

00:08:31.840 --> 00:08:34.210
I'm so happy to be in
this beautiful place,

00:08:34.210 --> 00:08:38.410
talking about my passion,
Islamic architecture.

00:08:38.410 --> 00:08:44.050
Have you ever thought why it
is called Islamic architecture?

00:08:44.050 --> 00:08:46.490
Like we are talking
about civilizations

00:08:46.490 --> 00:08:51.910
that have covered massive
areas from west to east,

00:08:51.910 --> 00:08:54.550
yet it is named with a belief.

00:08:54.550 --> 00:08:58.530
If we want to talk about
civilizations that were based

00:08:58.530 --> 00:09:03.050 position:56%
on religion, like Christian
architecture or Jewish architecture,

00:09:03.050 --> 00:09:06.350
they are never labeled
with their beliefs,

00:09:06.350 --> 00:09:09.270
except Islamic architecture.

00:09:09.270 --> 00:09:11.190
Have you thought of it?

00:09:11.190 --> 00:09:15.610
In reality, Islamic
architecture is not about a space

00:09:15.610 --> 00:09:19.300
to play, it's not about a mosque.

00:09:19.300 --> 00:09:22.010
It is philosophies in art.

00:09:22.010 --> 00:09:27.150
Philosophies, and selection and
creating elements, patterns.

00:09:27.150 --> 00:09:31.410
So today, I'm going to talk
about these philosophies

00:09:31.410 --> 00:09:38.110
that I have figured out while in
my research, doing my PhD study.

00:09:38.110 --> 00:09:44.140 position:56%
Let's go back to the birth of Islam.

00:09:44.140 --> 00:09:46.970
It started in Medina.

00:09:46.970 --> 00:09:51.190
There was no architecture at
that time, only mud buildings,

00:09:51.190 --> 00:09:53.600
like traditional buildings.

00:09:53.600 --> 00:09:56.770
Only one structure was
in the Arabian Peninsula,

00:09:56.770 --> 00:09:58.400
which was [foreign term].

00:09:58.400 --> 00:10:03.970
A prophet of Islam was
died, and they have moved

00:10:03.970 --> 00:10:10.030
and shifted the capital of Islam
to the north, to the [inaudible].

00:10:10.030 --> 00:10:16.360
And the first Islamic civilization
was called [foreign word spoken].

00:10:16.360 --> 00:10:17.660
In Arabic, [Arabic word spoken].

00:10:17.660 --> 00:10:25.370
So what has happened, from being in
a desert, in an Arabian peninsula,

00:10:25.370 --> 00:10:30.810
they have shifted, and was
exposed to the Roman architecture,

00:10:30.810 --> 00:10:35.560
Byzantine architecture,
and Sassanid architecture.

00:10:35.560 --> 00:10:40.940
It was like a shock seeing
[inaudible], mosaic, domes,

00:10:40.940 --> 00:10:44.250
seeing this massive
architecture of Roman.

00:10:44.250 --> 00:10:47.660
So they got influenced
with these elements.

00:10:47.660 --> 00:10:52.490
Now, when we go back
to Islam...oops,

00:10:52.490 --> 00:10:56.360
the [foreign word spoken]
was a temple.

00:10:56.360 --> 00:11:01.180
It was not a mosque.

00:11:01.180 --> 00:11:06.770
The methodologies at that time was
converting a temple to a mosque,

00:11:06.770 --> 00:11:09.370
converting a church to a mosque.

00:11:09.370 --> 00:11:12.370
So this was the methodology.

00:11:12.370 --> 00:11:19.490
Why? Economically,
easy, shows power.

00:11:19.490 --> 00:11:25.990
So what has happened, after
Islam, this temple was converted,

00:11:25.990 --> 00:11:29.230
and became a mosque, and
it's called The Holy Mosque,

00:11:29.230 --> 00:11:32.760
and located in Mecca.

00:11:32.760 --> 00:11:37.310
Now, [inaudible], the faith
of Islam has expanded.

00:11:37.310 --> 00:11:43.710
The east, to Persia, Central Asia,

00:11:43.710 --> 00:11:47.520
and west to North Africa,
and south Europe.

00:11:47.520 --> 00:11:53.950
So these massive lands were
covered with-were consisting

00:11:53.950 --> 00:11:55.910
of Islamic architecture.

00:11:55.910 --> 00:12:03.700
When we talk about Islamic
architecture, it is classified.

00:12:03.700 --> 00:12:07.730
Each period of time,
there was Islamic dynasty,

00:12:07.730 --> 00:12:12.360
and each dynasty has
its own architecture.

00:12:12.360 --> 00:12:17.470
By reviewing these elements, you
would know the name of the dynasty.

00:12:17.470 --> 00:12:23.200
So let me just go through
these dynasties.

00:12:23.200 --> 00:12:26.720
The first dynasty was the Umayyad.

00:12:26.720 --> 00:12:32.590
And then, Abbasid architecture,

00:12:32.590 --> 00:12:36.380
which is in Arabic,
[Arabic term spoken].

00:12:36.380 --> 00:12:40.560
Tulunid architecture, which
is [foreign word spoken].

00:12:41.730 --> 00:12:44.220
Fatimid architecture, which
is [foreign word spoken].

00:12:44.220 --> 00:12:47.510
Aghlabid architecture, which
is [foreign word spoken],

00:12:47.510 --> 00:12:50.150
Seljuk architecture, which
is [foreign word spoken].

00:12:50.150 --> 00:12:53.720
Ottoman architecture, which
is [foreign word spoken].

00:12:53.720 --> 00:12:57.010
And Mughal architecture, which
is [foreign word spoken].

00:12:57.010 --> 00:13:02.910
So these are part of the
Islamic architecture element.

00:13:02.910 --> 00:13:09.500
Whenever you see them,
you understand

00:13:09.500 --> 00:13:12.500
that these empires
were in these lands.

00:13:12.500 --> 00:13:16.030
How this architecture has
transferred-you're talking

00:13:16.030 --> 00:13:17.330
about massive area.

00:13:17.330 --> 00:13:21.230
Miles, it's west and east.

00:13:21.230 --> 00:13:33.000
Like, if you take a plane to
these places, it takes hours.

00:13:33.000 --> 00:13:36.870
What about traveling using camels?

00:13:36.870 --> 00:13:41.890
So these road trips
used to called caravans.

00:13:41.890 --> 00:13:44.450
A caravan site.

00:13:44.450 --> 00:13:50.810
In ancient times, there
were two routes,

00:13:50.810 --> 00:13:53.670
one in the summer,
and one in the winter.

00:13:53.670 --> 00:14:00.120
It started from China, going to
Afghanistan, from Afghanistan

00:14:00.120 --> 00:14:07.180 position:56%
to Khorasan, a road from Afghanistan
to Persia, and from Persia going

00:14:07.180 --> 00:14:11.180
to Iraq, and from Iraq,
you go back to Damascus,

00:14:11.180 --> 00:14:13.290
and from Damascus,
you have two roads.

00:14:13.290 --> 00:14:18.470
You go to Europe, to Italy, or
you take another road from Iraq

00:14:18.470 --> 00:14:23.480
to Egypt, from Egypt to Morocco,
and from Morocco to Spain.

00:14:23.480 --> 00:14:26.060
So these were the stations.

00:14:26.060 --> 00:14:34.440 position:56%
The caravan used to have like people
used to carry animals, carry food,

00:14:34.440 --> 00:14:38.650
carry art, carry human being.

00:14:38.650 --> 00:14:44.850
So it's a long road trip, and
culture used to go back and forth.

00:14:47.910 --> 00:14:54.350
The thing is, when you look and
observe the Islamic architecture,

00:14:54.350 --> 00:14:59.250
just like amazing art
with philosophies

00:14:59.250 --> 00:15:02.940
that sometimes-like
it has definition.

00:15:02.940 --> 00:15:07.690
It can be like all of a sudden
this architecture was created.

00:15:07.690 --> 00:15:09.430
So I had this curiosity

00:15:09.430 --> 00:15:14.060
of understanding how these
patterns were created.

00:15:14.060 --> 00:15:15.360
The bricks.

00:15:15.360 --> 00:15:19.970
How they are overlapping, the
orientation, the calligraphy.

00:15:19.970 --> 00:15:21.890
From where was the start?

00:15:21.890 --> 00:15:25.640 position:56%
You're talking about decades of art.

00:15:25.640 --> 00:15:30.240
So, my passion toward
this started in Spain.

00:15:30.240 --> 00:15:31.540
Did anyone go to [inaudible]?

00:15:31.540 --> 00:15:34.460
Oh, lucky you!

00:15:34.460 --> 00:15:35.760
One, two, three, four!

00:15:35.760 --> 00:15:37.990
Oh! I have friends here.

00:15:37.990 --> 00:15:39.550
Did you get this feeling

00:15:39.550 --> 00:15:46.070
of like tremendous art,
that have significance?

00:15:46.070 --> 00:15:50.580
That you cannot understand
from how much the beauty of it?

00:15:50.580 --> 00:15:53.850
So I started, because
it's part of my culture,

00:15:53.850 --> 00:15:58.060
wanting to understand these
philosophies, and linking religion

00:15:58.060 --> 00:16:01.020
to these philosophies,
how they were developed.

00:16:01.020 --> 00:16:11.780
So in Granada, which is Alhambra,
I was like every time you go there,

00:16:11.780 --> 00:16:15.480
you feel like you never saw
it, because it is lots of art

00:16:15.480 --> 00:16:20.770
that you cannot observe from
one time, from one visit.

00:16:20.770 --> 00:16:27.480
Observing these architectural
elements, the bricks, the stones,

00:16:27.480 --> 00:16:34.490
the arches, the colors,
the domes, the details,

00:16:34.490 --> 00:16:37.470
and here was the big shock.

00:16:37.470 --> 00:16:38.950
What is this?

00:16:38.950 --> 00:16:42.690
How can you identify this element?

00:16:42.690 --> 00:16:44.340
Is it a dome?

00:16:44.340 --> 00:16:48.030
Like, what can we call this?

00:16:48.030 --> 00:16:51.170
It's tremendous art
that you cannot explain,

00:16:51.170 --> 00:16:54.470
and I wanted to know how
they have created it.

00:16:54.470 --> 00:16:57.270
How is the structure,
the construction,

00:16:57.270 --> 00:16:59.470
how many years it took them.

00:16:59.470 --> 00:17:04.130
So I started searching for
philosophies, and understanding,

00:17:04.130 --> 00:17:10.540
going to vintage shops, trying
to buy books, to understand it.

00:17:10.540 --> 00:17:15.850
And I'm having here, like it is
tall, connected with the wall,

00:17:15.850 --> 00:17:19.770
with the ceiling, but you
cannot describe the space.

00:17:20.790 --> 00:17:27.040
So I started-I figured out one
of the great philosophies in art,

00:17:27.040 --> 00:17:31.360
in Islamic art, which is
called the panic of emptiness.

00:17:31.360 --> 00:17:37.780
And it to me is that a flat form,

00:17:37.780 --> 00:17:40.350
and you extrude it,
so it's like panic.

00:17:40.350 --> 00:17:47.450
And from here, the concept of these
elements started to be created,

00:17:47.450 --> 00:17:51.730
like they designed these
patterns, flat designs,

00:17:51.730 --> 00:17:55.040
and then they extrude
it and make it 3D.

00:17:55.040 --> 00:17:57.630
So I wanted to know more
about these patterns

00:17:57.630 --> 00:18:00.140
from where they were abstracted.

00:18:00.140 --> 00:18:07.780
And I found vintage
drawings from Persia.

00:18:07.780 --> 00:18:14.360
And I started to think and analyze,
and read more, and surprisingly,

00:18:14.360 --> 00:18:19.650
these patterns were
extracted from Quran.

00:18:19.650 --> 00:18:23.620
These, the Quran is
the book, for Muslims.

00:18:23.620 --> 00:18:30.290
And they started translating these
phrases, these verses, into art.

00:18:30.290 --> 00:18:32.910
So they calculate, for example,

00:18:32.910 --> 00:18:37.510
it's written like here,
[foreign words spoken].

00:18:37.510 --> 00:18:38.810
Seven skies.

00:18:38.810 --> 00:18:40.580
Here is the vision.

00:18:40.580 --> 00:18:41.880
Seven skies.

00:18:41.880 --> 00:18:48.990
So they take number seven, multiply
it by two, divide it by four,

00:18:48.990 --> 00:18:52.340
and these, they started
having these equations,

00:18:52.340 --> 00:18:57.040
and due to these equations, they
start to draw their patterns.

00:18:57.040 --> 00:19:00.660
Let's have an example.

00:19:00.660 --> 00:19:06.860
Ah, these philosophies, this
philosophy wanted me to understand

00:19:06.860 --> 00:19:11.670
from where geometries started,
like and I figured out one

00:19:11.670 --> 00:19:18.580
of these colors, Persian color,
called Muhammad Al Khwarizmi.

00:19:18.580 --> 00:19:22.890
He is the scholar who
invented geometry.

00:19:22.890 --> 00:19:26.220
At that time, it was
just in the 9th Century.

00:19:26.220 --> 00:19:27.520
This is [foreign word spoken].

00:19:27.520 --> 00:19:34.350 position:56%
People started trying to
understand it, and there was a boom,

00:19:34.350 --> 00:19:39.820
and evolution, and
understanding these geometries.

00:19:39.820 --> 00:19:46.910
So through caravan roads, these
scholars started to travel around.

00:19:46.910 --> 00:19:56.380
The scholars started to move from
places from-through the caravans,

00:19:56.380 --> 00:20:01.630
and this knowledge started
to be like quite a fashion,

00:20:01.630 --> 00:20:05.270
like it is started to be
the knowledge, like a trend.

00:20:05.270 --> 00:20:08.440
Like when they invented computers,
everyone wanted to learn it.

00:20:08.440 --> 00:20:12.370
And now we're with the
iPhones and more stuff,

00:20:12.370 --> 00:20:14.050
they keep inventing things.

00:20:14.050 --> 00:20:17.900
So at that time, geometry
was an invention,

00:20:17.900 --> 00:20:22.520
and they started applying it
into architecture and to pattern,

00:20:22.520 --> 00:20:25.110
and to design, and to [inaudible],

00:20:25.110 --> 00:20:28.180
and it became part of
the Islamic culture.

00:20:28.180 --> 00:20:39.600 position:56%
This took me to another philosopher,
who invented the social signs.

00:20:39.600 --> 00:20:43.770
Ibn Khaldun, one of
the famous historians,

00:20:43.770 --> 00:20:48.600
who has written a book
called Al Muqaddimah,

00:20:48.600 --> 00:20:50.410
which is an introduction.

00:20:50.410 --> 00:20:56.430
This book is consists of lots of
philosophies, and what is unique

00:20:56.430 --> 00:21:01.980
about Ibn Khaldun, that there is
link between my thinking and his.

00:21:01.980 --> 00:21:06.340
He linked social science with
history and civilizations,

00:21:06.340 --> 00:21:11.600
and on the other hand, I have this
fashion of linking social science

00:21:11.600 --> 00:21:15.600
to architecture, why these
buildings were created.

00:21:15.600 --> 00:21:19.080
These buildings were
created for humans.

00:21:19.080 --> 00:21:24.650
What is behind this, so I wanted
to dig more, into Ibn Khaldun,

00:21:24.650 --> 00:21:26.470
and understand his way of thinking,

00:21:26.470 --> 00:21:29.900
because he analyzed
civilization and history.

00:21:29.900 --> 00:21:36.580
And I decided to go to have
a trip to his neighborhood.

00:21:36.580 --> 00:21:41.790
So I moved from south
Europe to North Africa.

00:21:42.820 --> 00:21:47.520
And specifically, to his
city, which is Tunis.

00:21:47.520 --> 00:21:48.820
Anyone went to Tunis?

00:21:48.820 --> 00:21:50.120
Any friends?

00:21:50.120 --> 00:21:52.480
Oh, you're my friend
[laughter], you traveled a lot.

00:21:52.480 --> 00:21:55.750
We should talk about
this, your travels.

00:21:55.750 --> 00:22:00.560
The thing is, I wanted
to understand, like,

00:22:00.560 --> 00:22:04.830
because you cannot think there is
something about the environment,

00:22:04.830 --> 00:22:07.150
like my passion started in Spain.

00:22:07.150 --> 00:22:10.620
I wanted to know what was
the passion behind Ibn

00:22:10.620 --> 00:22:12.200
Khaldun's studies?

00:22:12.200 --> 00:22:18.020
So I went to his neighborhood,

00:22:18.020 --> 00:22:21.040
no one went to his
neighborhood except me-oh,

00:22:21.040 --> 00:22:22.430
we're friends [laughter].

00:22:22.430 --> 00:22:28.440
I wanted to live the past
with an eye of the present.

00:22:28.440 --> 00:22:30.480
I wanted to analyze it myself.

00:22:30.480 --> 00:22:34.850
I didn't want to depend
on books and resources.

00:22:34.850 --> 00:22:39.570
I went to his mosque,
where he used to teach,

00:22:39.570 --> 00:22:45.770
and wanted to dig more
into the oldest city.

00:22:45.770 --> 00:22:53.050 position:56%
Ibn Khaldun quoted, "History appears
to be just a story, but at its core,

00:22:53.050 --> 00:22:57.280
it's more of observation
and investigation."

00:22:57.280 --> 00:23:00.090 position:56%
Which made me want to know more, me.

00:23:00.090 --> 00:23:01.690
I wanted to know from my eye.

00:23:01.690 --> 00:23:03.040
I wanted to observe it myself.

00:23:03.040 --> 00:23:08.990 position:56%
And I ended by quoting
"Observation is the key to history."

00:23:08.990 --> 00:23:11.200
It links you to stories.

00:23:11.200 --> 00:23:15.420
It takes you to dig and
search for philosophies.

00:23:15.420 --> 00:23:22.340 position:56%
So I wanted to visit the oldest city
in North Africa, which is in Tunis,

00:23:22.340 --> 00:23:24.640
and it's called Kairouan [laughs].

00:23:24.640 --> 00:23:32.970
Al Kairouan is the oldest
Islamic city in North Africa.

00:23:32.970 --> 00:23:37.930
I wanted to know what are
the architectural monuments

00:23:37.930 --> 00:23:40.610
in this land.

00:23:40.610 --> 00:23:45.630
And following the first
steps and arrival of Islam.

00:23:47.090 --> 00:23:51.900
I started taking photos, like
Japanese, like Japanese here,

00:23:51.900 --> 00:23:55.270
like taking pictures,
as much as I can.

00:23:55.270 --> 00:23:58.000
It was so hot, you
will never imagine.

00:23:58.000 --> 00:24:00.550
I know I am from Saudi,
I understand this,

00:24:00.550 --> 00:24:05.870
but you would never understand what
hot means until you go to Kairouan,

00:24:05.870 --> 00:24:12.000 position:56%
and it was like thinking, why would
people build a civilization, mosque,

00:24:12.000 --> 00:24:15.630
and do these arts, in a desert.

00:24:15.630 --> 00:24:20.050
Which made me think one of
the Islamic philosophies.

00:24:20.050 --> 00:24:25.610
And I wanted to dig and go
back to the-back to history.

00:24:25.610 --> 00:24:32.400
And go to the spot where the first
Islamic civilization started,

00:24:32.400 --> 00:24:34.740
which is in Damascus.

00:24:34.740 --> 00:24:41.720
I went to double check on the
form of the mosques and compare

00:24:41.720 --> 00:24:48.500
between [inaudible] and North
Africa, Tunis, and then Damascus,

00:24:48.500 --> 00:24:54.430
and I figured out great
similarity in the form of mosque.

00:24:54.430 --> 00:24:55.750
But guess what!

00:24:55.750 --> 00:24:59.540
This mosque was a church.

00:24:59.540 --> 00:25:03.650
The elements that the great
mosque, the great mosque

00:25:03.650 --> 00:25:07.960
of Damascus were part of
the Byzantine architecture.

00:25:07.960 --> 00:25:11.400 position:56%
A tower, the chamber hall, the dome.

00:25:11.400 --> 00:25:17.950
So Muslims, when the Islam
religion, when it expanded

00:25:17.950 --> 00:25:21.740
and reached the [inaudible], they
were exposed to these cultures,

00:25:21.740 --> 00:25:27.830
and they started adapting
elements from the past.

00:25:27.830 --> 00:25:30.690
The tower, the Christian tower,

00:25:30.690 --> 00:25:34.700
or a part of the Byzantine
architecture became Minarets.

00:25:34.700 --> 00:25:40.800
And the chamber halls were used as
well in the Islamic architecture,

00:25:40.800 --> 00:25:46.380
this is the entrance, before
you enter the prayer hall,

00:25:46.380 --> 00:25:49.240
and they also adopted the domes.

00:25:49.240 --> 00:25:57.780
So I wanted to double check, and
the all cities, of the whole land,

00:25:57.780 --> 00:26:04.560
and I went to Fes, in Morocco.

00:26:04.560 --> 00:26:08.210
It is the oldest city in Morocco.

00:26:08.210 --> 00:26:10.800
And different art.

00:26:10.800 --> 00:26:12.430
Different forms.

00:26:12.430 --> 00:26:18.530
If we compare it is more
similar to Andalusia.

00:26:18.530 --> 00:26:26.320
So Morocco and Andalusia have
similarities, while Kairouan

00:26:26.320 --> 00:26:28.350
and Damascus have similarity.

00:26:28.350 --> 00:26:30.480
So there are forms.

00:26:30.480 --> 00:26:34.730
The mosque are not one
structure, or one form.

00:26:34.730 --> 00:26:47.630
So I had to, and first, I figured
out the first Islamic creation

00:26:47.630 --> 00:26:53.980 position:56%
which is the [inaudible], it was not
extracted from other civilizations,

00:26:53.980 --> 00:26:58.000
and it was created by Muslims.

00:26:58.000 --> 00:27:04.280
It is a dome, cross-arched, forming
a dome, and they were similar

00:27:04.280 --> 00:27:08.130
to the one in Andalusia, and
they are considered the first

00:27:08.130 --> 00:27:11.910
architectural elements
created by Muslims.

00:27:11.910 --> 00:27:16.040
I have-as I have said
before, they were influenced

00:27:16.040 --> 00:27:20.360
with previous elements, but
this was an Islamic creation,

00:27:20.360 --> 00:27:24.670
and the patterns are geometrical.

00:27:24.670 --> 00:27:31.020
Digging in the history, the years,

00:27:31.020 --> 00:27:37.170
checking what was built before the
other, and I figured out that this,

00:27:37.170 --> 00:27:42.640
in Spain, the first cross-vaults
were created in Spain.

00:27:42.640 --> 00:27:48.580
So I went back home [inaudible],
double checking and trying

00:27:48.580 --> 00:27:51.830
to understand how these
philosophies,

00:27:51.830 --> 00:27:57.810
how this creation have started,
architectural creation has started.

00:27:57.810 --> 00:28:00.200
And we go back to the
Panic of Emptiness.

00:28:00.200 --> 00:28:07.100
Where the pattern, the flat
patterns, became extruded, 3D,

00:28:07.100 --> 00:28:10.070
which goes back to
the [inaudible] signs.

00:28:10.070 --> 00:28:16.400
So they created on these
philosophies, to create an art.

00:28:17.650 --> 00:28:22.940
These are the famous cross vaults.

00:28:22.940 --> 00:28:25.900
And the first in Cordoba.

00:28:25.900 --> 00:28:29.480
Then another style.

00:28:29.480 --> 00:28:31.210
Another form.

00:28:31.210 --> 00:28:36.090
And the 10th century, in Zaragoza.

00:28:36.090 --> 00:28:46.650
Ibn Khaldun says the professions
are perfected, and became plenty,

00:28:46.650 --> 00:28:49.720
when the demand for them increased.

00:28:49.720 --> 00:28:55.170 position:56%
I quote, "If a profession is in
great demand, people will learn it."

00:28:55.170 --> 00:29:00.490
Like my mom, she knew
how to use What's Up,

00:29:00.490 --> 00:29:05.190 position:56%
and my mobile never stopped, so
whenever you need to know something,

00:29:05.190 --> 00:29:11.350
it become like the
demand of it became great.

00:29:12.650 --> 00:29:17.070 position:56%
And here comes, when Muslims started

00:29:17.070 --> 00:29:22.500
to apply these geometrical
patterns into the elements.

00:29:24.020 --> 00:29:33.370
As you can see, in Iran, they
started Isfahan, and Termiz,

00:29:33.370 --> 00:29:39.660
and in Central Asia, they started
using these geometrical patterns

00:29:39.660 --> 00:29:46.390
into minarets, into domes, into
the façades, exteriors, interiors,

00:29:46.390 --> 00:29:53.190
patterns, geometrical patterns
became part of the Islamic culture.

00:29:53.190 --> 00:29:59.370 position:56%
Here are other types, when they have
mixed the tiles with the bricks.

00:29:59.370 --> 00:30:02.040
So it became the trend.

00:30:02.040 --> 00:30:08.410
And it became part of the
Islamic architectural identity.

00:30:08.410 --> 00:30:13.720
And as we have said before, these
patterns are not random designs,

00:30:13.720 --> 00:30:22.160
always extracted from Islamic
disciplines, from Quranic, versus,

00:30:22.160 --> 00:30:30.290
now these patterns became part
of an architectural design,

00:30:30.290 --> 00:30:34.590
like if you can see, on
the side, a Muqarnas,

00:30:34.590 --> 00:30:41.490
is that these patterns became
3D, so it started to be part

00:30:41.490 --> 00:30:46.770 position:56%
of the Islamic culture in
building, having these 3D monuments,

00:30:46.770 --> 00:30:50.020
instead of having flat patterns.

00:30:53.290 --> 00:30:56.000
Examples of a Muqarnas.

00:30:56.000 --> 00:31:00.730
Ceilings, in Morocco,
and Alhambra, again.

00:31:00.730 --> 00:31:05.860
So my study and trip and journey
going back and forth leads me back

00:31:05.860 --> 00:31:10.100
to a Muqarnas where
I started, Alhambra,

00:31:10.100 --> 00:31:15.370 position:56%
to try to understand how this
architectural element was developed.

00:31:15.370 --> 00:31:17.580
And my studies about
these philosophies

00:31:17.580 --> 00:31:27.290
and geometrical designs,
takes me back to Alhambra.

00:31:27.290 --> 00:31:31.230
Oops. This is supposed
to be me [laughter].

00:31:31.230 --> 00:31:39.570
Ibn Khaldun quote, "Language is
one side of people's thoughts."

00:31:39.570 --> 00:31:44.330
And a quote, "Language is
a way to explore history."

00:31:44.330 --> 00:31:49.420
Normally, when we read about
any subject that interests us,

00:31:49.420 --> 00:31:55.520
we read it from looking for our
language, and from my observation

00:31:55.520 --> 00:31:58.730 position:56%
and study, I figured out it's wrong.

00:31:58.730 --> 00:32:03.170
If you want to know a certain
science, you have to know it

00:32:03.170 --> 00:32:06.160
with the language of the
person who have written it.

00:32:06.160 --> 00:32:10.950
Because translation changes the
meaning, changes the philosophy,

00:32:10.950 --> 00:32:13.680
and from the whole
trips, I understood,

00:32:13.680 --> 00:32:16.810
understanding people's
way of thinking.

00:32:16.810 --> 00:32:23.320
The way to explain that knowledge
is very important, that's why I try

00:32:23.320 --> 00:32:28.090
to understand Persian,
start to understand Spanish,

00:32:28.090 --> 00:32:30.870
and even [inaudible], which
is the language of Morocco.

00:32:30.870 --> 00:32:37.920
And that is the whole story of
the geometrical Islamic art,

00:32:37.920 --> 00:32:41.830
and I was like, I took
you through the journey

00:32:41.830 --> 00:32:47.100 position:56%
to understand my philosophy, and the
Panic of the Emptiness philosophy

00:32:47.100 --> 00:32:50.680
that was created by Muslims,
and started to travel

00:32:50.680 --> 00:32:54.510
around the massive
lands from east to west.

00:32:54.510 --> 00:32:57.510
Thank you for being here today.

00:32:57.510 --> 00:33:04.380
[ Applause ]

00:33:04.380 --> 00:33:06.200
&gt;&gt; Thank you.

00:33:06.200 --> 00:33:09.470
Have time for question and answer.

00:33:09.470 --> 00:33:10.770
Okay?

00:33:10.770 --> 00:33:13.240
&gt;&gt; I'd like to know if
the cross [inaudible],

00:33:13.240 --> 00:33:17.330
the cross-hatch dome was meant
to function like the buttresses,

00:33:17.330 --> 00:33:23.640
and some European domes
to keep the weight off it?

00:33:26.350 --> 00:33:30.800
Do you know if that
was built into Islam,

00:33:30.800 --> 00:33:35.130
that they used for this process?

00:33:35.130 --> 00:33:41.590
&gt;&gt; The question is were the
cross hatched domes meant to-

00:33:41.590 --> 00:33:42.890
&gt;&gt; Beyond the design-

00:33:42.890 --> 00:33:44.420
&gt;&gt; Beyond the design,
were they meant to-

00:33:44.420 --> 00:33:45.940
&gt;&gt; Distribute the weight
of the dome.

00:33:45.940 --> 00:33:49.390
Like buttresses are in some
European architectural domes.

00:33:49.390 --> 00:33:51.840
&gt;&gt; Were they meant to distribute
the weight of the design

00:33:51.840 --> 00:33:53.550
like the buttresses in the-

00:33:53.550 --> 00:33:55.300
&gt;&gt; And please, again?

00:33:55.300 --> 00:33:57.390
&gt;&gt; Were the cross hatch domes meant

00:33:57.390 --> 00:34:02.000
to distribute the weight,
like in the European-

00:34:02.000 --> 00:34:03.300
&gt;&gt; Buttresses.

00:34:03.300 --> 00:34:04.600
&gt;&gt; Buttresses.

00:34:04.600 --> 00:34:05.900
&gt;&gt; Amazing, it's not.

00:34:05.900 --> 00:34:09.250
And that was the great
study that Spanish people,

00:34:09.250 --> 00:34:12.070
trying to understand
the construction

00:34:12.070 --> 00:34:16.330
of the gothic vaults,
and the Islamic vaults.

00:34:16.330 --> 00:34:21.070
The thing is, they are patterns,
and they are-the weight goes

00:34:21.070 --> 00:34:23.760
to the spoke squinches [assumed
spelling] on the corners.

00:34:23.760 --> 00:34:30.040
That was, that is why the squinches
are designed in a [inaudible],

00:34:30.040 --> 00:34:35.540
which has niches, so they are
only forms that forming the dome,

00:34:35.540 --> 00:34:40.000
but they don't carry the
structure of the vault.

00:34:40.000 --> 00:34:44.880
Now, but in the gothic
designs, they carry the vault.

00:34:44.880 --> 00:34:47.170
That's why they are
built with stone.

00:34:47.170 --> 00:34:49.540
On the other hand,
Islamic architecture,

00:34:49.540 --> 00:34:53.470
they used to use bricks, and
the bricks are very light

00:34:53.470 --> 00:34:55.870
in weight, and very easy to form.

00:34:55.870 --> 00:35:00.690
That's why most of the Islamic
architecture used to use bricks,

00:35:00.690 --> 00:35:06.070
although the basis, the foundation
of the architectural buildings are

00:35:06.070 --> 00:35:09.010
from big stones, to carry
the load of the building,

00:35:09.010 --> 00:35:11.120
but then they use bricks.

00:35:11.120 --> 00:35:16.690
This is very deep question
about the vaults.

00:35:16.690 --> 00:35:18.740
&gt;&gt; Please.

00:35:18.740 --> 00:35:23.840
&gt;&gt; Originally some new
mosques built in [inaudible],

00:35:23.840 --> 00:35:32.530
do they follow any of this pattern?

00:35:32.530 --> 00:35:34.680
&gt;&gt; The question is the
new mosques built in-

00:35:34.680 --> 00:35:36.280
&gt;&gt; In Senegal.

00:35:36.280 --> 00:35:39.950
&gt;&gt; In Senegal, do they
follow the same pattern as-

00:35:39.950 --> 00:35:41.250
&gt;&gt; The what?

00:35:41.250 --> 00:35:42.720 position:56%
&gt;&gt; The new mosques built in Senegal.

00:35:42.720 --> 00:35:44.180
Do they follow the same?

00:35:44.180 --> 00:35:49.690 position:56%
&gt;&gt; I need to see a picture, Senegal?

00:35:49.690 --> 00:35:53.390
&gt;&gt; Do they have [inaudible]
minarets?

00:35:53.390 --> 00:35:58.630
&gt;&gt; Conical, conical vaults?

00:35:58.630 --> 00:36:00.840
&gt;&gt; The minaret [inaudible]-

00:36:00.840 --> 00:36:03.180
&gt;&gt; Ah these, yeah.

00:36:03.180 --> 00:36:07.380
These are Islamic,
but they are conical

00:36:07.380 --> 00:36:15.030
and they are famed during
the dynasty called Rustamid.

00:36:15.030 --> 00:36:19.330
It is Rustamid Dynasty.

00:36:19.330 --> 00:36:23.670
And they are not-they are Islamic,

00:36:23.670 --> 00:36:26.080
but they are not-like
they are branch.

00:36:26.080 --> 00:36:29.160
And they have their own
architectural elements,

00:36:29.160 --> 00:36:31.820
and they are conical.

00:36:31.820 --> 00:36:35.030
Did you visit the-oh!

00:36:35.030 --> 00:36:38.260
How are they from inside?

00:36:38.260 --> 00:36:39.640
&gt;&gt; They're [inaudible]-

00:36:39.640 --> 00:36:42.480
&gt;&gt; Yeah. They are built by bricks.

00:36:42.480 --> 00:36:49.010
They are built by bricks, and even
in Tanzania, there are samples

00:36:49.010 --> 00:36:56.510 position:56%
of them, they famed in Africa, yeah,
you're right, but only in Africa.

[ Inaudible Comments ]

00:37:02.230 --> 00:37:03.530
&gt;&gt; What did he say?

00:37:03.530 --> 00:37:06.830
&gt;&gt; They're financed by Saudi
Arabia, the ones built in Tanzania.

00:37:06.830 --> 00:37:10.190
&gt;&gt; I'm not sure about
this information.

00:37:10.190 --> 00:37:14.720
Yeah. But there is architecture
for the desert people who live

00:37:14.720 --> 00:37:21.450
in the desert, and normally
they use mud, but we don't have

00:37:21.450 --> 00:37:26.330
in Saudi these conical,
pointed vaults.

00:37:26.330 --> 00:37:31.620
But I'll double check, and this
is the beauty about researching,

00:37:31.620 --> 00:37:34.580
that you get an information
and you dig on,

00:37:34.580 --> 00:37:38.050
and go and maybe visit
Senegal, after this question.

00:37:38.050 --> 00:37:44.070
&gt;&gt; Thank you very much for your
presentation, beautiful images,

00:37:44.070 --> 00:37:51.840
I wanted to ask you, in terms of
the materials, you already alluded

00:37:51.840 --> 00:37:57.280
to it, but in terms of the
materials, did the different types

00:37:57.280 --> 00:38:00.010
of architecture that existed
throughout this large region

00:38:00.010 --> 00:38:04.890
that you show, was it
adapted to the environment?

00:38:04.890 --> 00:38:09.040
In other words, some environments
are more rocky, some have marble,

00:38:09.040 --> 00:38:18.090
others have, you know, sand,
build-build glass, or mosaics,

00:38:18.090 --> 00:38:22.370
and so, were the differences

00:38:22.370 --> 00:38:28.400
in architecture also
affected by the environment?

00:38:28.400 --> 00:38:33.960
Some countries is more rain, others
there is snow, others are warm,

00:38:33.960 --> 00:38:39.900
and hot, so-the styles,
and the materials,

00:38:39.900 --> 00:38:43.230
were they affected
by the environment?

00:38:43.230 --> 00:38:45.720
&gt;&gt; The question is were
the styles affected

00:38:45.720 --> 00:38:47.700
by the environment,
and the materials.

00:38:47.700 --> 00:38:49.470
Were the styles and
the materials affected

00:38:49.470 --> 00:38:52.100 position:56%
by the environments of these places?

00:38:52.100 --> 00:38:56.700
&gt;&gt; Yes, of course, because as
you saw, that Ottoman empire,

00:38:56.700 --> 00:39:02.410
because marble [inaudible] and even
the Byzantine, used to use mosaic,

00:39:02.410 --> 00:39:08.370
for the easy, like the
materials are very easy to get,

00:39:08.370 --> 00:39:15.500
while in other places, they used to
use mud, because it's easy to use

00:39:15.500 --> 00:39:20.010
in form, and it's more easy to get,

00:39:20.010 --> 00:39:25.070
so that's why there are
different styles, but yet,

00:39:25.070 --> 00:39:27.840
they use the same architectural
elements.

00:39:27.840 --> 00:39:32.790
The minarets are always there,
using different materials.

00:39:32.790 --> 00:39:36.330
The dome is always there, but
using different materials.

00:39:36.330 --> 00:39:39.390
So the architectural
elements are similar,

00:39:39.390 --> 00:39:43.900
but the way of building them,
the design, the style, different,

00:39:43.900 --> 00:39:46.550
due to the area and the location.

00:39:46.550 --> 00:39:53.790 position:56%
&gt;&gt; And the related to that, do those
materials then affect how a dome is

00:39:53.790 --> 00:39:58.250
built, because some materials
are heavier, others are lighter.

00:39:58.250 --> 00:39:59.920
So-

00:39:59.920 --> 00:40:04.630
&gt;&gt; In terms, if we're talking about
vaults, all Islamic architecture,

00:40:04.630 --> 00:40:10.480
in all their periods of time,
they have used the bricks.

00:40:10.480 --> 00:40:12.150
Because easy to form.

00:40:12.150 --> 00:40:15.900
Because these vaults are not
carrying, so they can play

00:40:15.900 --> 00:40:19.990
and form the vaults
in different designs.

00:40:19.990 --> 00:40:23.370
That's why we see the vaults in
Andalusia, different than Iran,

00:40:23.370 --> 00:40:28.370
different than in [inaudible],
they have different designs.

00:40:28.370 --> 00:40:31.710
But they use the same material.

00:40:31.710 --> 00:40:36.580
Because you-if you use the stone,
different construction methods.

00:40:36.580 --> 00:40:41.450
&gt;&gt; I actually have a question.

00:40:41.450 --> 00:40:44.870
You mentioned the philosophy
behind the building

00:40:44.870 --> 00:40:48.770
of the-you mentioned
the freedom of the-

00:40:48.770 --> 00:40:50.470
&gt;&gt; The panic of the emptiness-

00:40:50.470 --> 00:40:51.770
&gt;&gt; Panic of Emptiness.

00:40:51.770 --> 00:40:54.310
Can you elaborate on that
a little bit more on that,

00:40:54.310 --> 00:40:56.700
can you tell us more about that?

00:40:56.700 --> 00:40:58.000
Yeah?

00:40:58.000 --> 00:41:01.300
&gt;&gt; Now the thing is, this theory
actually I've learned it in Spain,

00:41:01.300 --> 00:41:08.190
because Andalusia was the greatest
like peak of Islamic architecture,

00:41:08.190 --> 00:41:13.230
was in Andalusia, and they
emphasize in universities a lot

00:41:13.230 --> 00:41:17.960
about Islamic architecture, and it
became part of the Spanish culture,

00:41:17.960 --> 00:41:20.520
like you go to kindergarten school,

00:41:20.520 --> 00:41:23.820
and they teach them how
these patterns are built,

00:41:23.820 --> 00:41:26.250 position:56%
because it is part of their history.

00:41:26.250 --> 00:41:30.410
It became part of their heritage,
although it was built by Muslims,

00:41:30.410 --> 00:41:32.690
but is the culture of the land.

00:41:32.690 --> 00:41:38.510
So they teach them these, and what
is nice, that they kept the names.

00:41:38.510 --> 00:41:43.110
There are 3,000 world,
and even the vocabulary

00:41:43.110 --> 00:41:49.180
of the Islamic architecture still
use the same-you see Spanish person

00:41:49.180 --> 00:41:51.560
talking to you saying
[Islamic term spoken],

00:41:51.560 --> 00:41:54.400
saying [Islamic term spoken],
saying [Islamic term spoken],

00:41:54.400 --> 00:41:58.660
so these became part of
the culture of the city.

00:41:58.660 --> 00:42:01.960
And so I wanted to know more,
because it's an opportunity,

00:42:01.960 --> 00:42:06.760 position:56%
I am there, and I wanted to study
more about the Islamic architecture,

00:42:06.760 --> 00:42:09.570
and I started digging in this,

00:42:09.570 --> 00:42:13.220
and in our university
[inaudible] considered one

00:42:13.220 --> 00:42:16.990
of the very complicated
architectural elements,

00:42:16.990 --> 00:42:20.770
like until now, lots
of researchers trying

00:42:20.770 --> 00:42:26.690
to understand how these elements,
and parts, connected together.

00:42:26.690 --> 00:42:30.880
Some are connected with each
other, some are attached.

00:42:30.880 --> 00:42:36.700
So there are eight designs of
different construction methods.

00:42:36.700 --> 00:42:38.790
Eight designs of [inaudible].

00:42:38.790 --> 00:42:43.260
So in Spain, they do lots of
research about [inaudible].

00:42:43.260 --> 00:42:46.480
Lots of research, and
I felt like they are

00:42:46.480 --> 00:42:49.950
like if I knew, I wanted
to know this.

00:42:49.950 --> 00:42:55.430
And they told me about how
to analyze these patterns.

00:42:55.430 --> 00:43:03.450
They use the AutoCAD and
programs to flatten these images,

00:43:03.450 --> 00:43:08.930 position:56%
and draw these patterns, and extrude
them again, and then they use it

00:43:08.930 --> 00:43:12.410 position:56%
in the university, they have
workshops to understand [inaudible].

00:43:12.410 --> 00:43:18.090
So basically it is about a pattern,
geometrical pattern, connected,

00:43:18.090 --> 00:43:22.090
overlapped, whatever is
designed, like they do that in 3D.

00:43:22.090 --> 00:43:26.030
They flatten the image, then they
start understanding how these

00:43:26.030 --> 00:43:31.920
patterns are drawn, then
they extrude it and that.

00:43:31.920 --> 00:43:37.850
So it's basically about a flat, and
then you extrude it, to become 3D.

00:43:37.850 --> 00:43:43.470 position:56%
Which was long time ago the 3D, now
we are in AutoCAD, understanding how

00:43:43.470 --> 00:43:47.050
to extrude these elements,
but it's amazing

00:43:47.050 --> 00:43:52.380
that they discovered this long time
ago, and we never knew about it.

00:43:53.670 --> 00:43:57.850
Or I didn't know about
it [laughter].

00:43:57.850 --> 00:43:59.150
&gt;&gt; Just a follow-up question,

00:43:59.150 --> 00:44:02.800
how does this Andalusian
philosophy affect other areas

00:44:02.800 --> 00:44:06.520
in the Islamic world, Hispanic, of-

00:44:06.520 --> 00:44:11.370
&gt;&gt; The thing is of, that
this philosophy became part

00:44:11.370 --> 00:44:17.500
of the [foreign term spoken],
when they invented the geometry.

00:44:17.500 --> 00:44:23.760
So [foreign term spoken]
was in Egypt, and Morocco,

00:44:23.760 --> 00:44:26.080
and Persia, and central Asia.

00:44:26.080 --> 00:44:35.560
It became part of the
architectural construction and art.

00:44:37.510 --> 00:45:12.890
[ Inaudible Question ]

00:45:12.890 --> 00:45:15.240
&gt;&gt; So the question
is, how do you account

00:45:15.240 --> 00:45:19.500
for the other decorative elements
in the mosques in various regions

00:45:19.500 --> 00:45:22.070
of the Islamic world,
aside from the-

00:45:22.070 --> 00:45:23.690
&gt;&gt; How do?

00:45:23.690 --> 00:45:24.990
How do?

00:45:24.990 --> 00:45:26.290
&gt;&gt; With regard to this philosophy,

00:45:26.290 --> 00:45:27.590
what about the other
decorative elements,

00:45:27.590 --> 00:45:30.590
aside from the basic structures?

00:45:30.590 --> 00:45:32.200
So the different decorative
elements,

00:45:32.200 --> 00:45:34.280
say in Morocco, in Spain and-

00:45:34.280 --> 00:45:37.320
&gt;&gt; Yeah. The thing is,
this philosophy only used

00:45:37.320 --> 00:45:42.660
for 3D elements, like the patterns
used in [foreign word spoken],

00:45:42.660 --> 00:45:53.500
and like the mosque is consist
of court, dome, there are vaults

00:45:53.500 --> 00:45:58.040
in some mosques, there is
minaret, there is [inaudible],

00:45:58.040 --> 00:46:01.000
so the thing is, this
philosophy is only applied

00:46:01.000 --> 00:46:04.870
for 3D architectural elements.

00:46:04.870 --> 00:46:08.550
The other decorative
patterns do not apply,

00:46:08.550 --> 00:46:12.630
this philosophy does not apply
on the patterns that are used

00:46:12.630 --> 00:46:19.280
into calligraphy, for example, or
the geometrical patterns and tiles,

00:46:19.280 --> 00:46:24.170
it is only used for the 3D,
because it's panic, it's extruding.

00:46:24.170 --> 00:46:30.510
I am not sure if I answered
your question, actually, if-

00:46:30.510 --> 00:47:00.760
[ Inaudible ]

00:47:00.760 --> 00:47:02.060
&gt;&gt; Can you get?

00:47:02.060 --> 00:47:06.110
&gt;&gt; Yeah, like the arches, the
Quranic designs, and so on,

00:47:06.110 --> 00:47:11.260
are these also part
of this philosophy or?

00:47:11.260 --> 00:47:14.840
&gt;&gt; The arches are element,
construction elements,

00:47:14.840 --> 00:47:16.480
they carry, they carry load.

00:47:16.480 --> 00:47:19.320
We are talking about forms.

00:47:19.320 --> 00:47:22.400
Like the [foreign word
spoken] doesn't carry.

00:47:22.400 --> 00:47:28.620
It is only niches, or it's
only like ornamentation

00:47:28.620 --> 00:47:33.170
but 3D ornamentations,
they are not structures.

00:47:33.170 --> 00:47:36.230
The dome, the Muqarnas
dome is a dome,

00:47:36.230 --> 00:47:38.030
that's why it's called
Muquarnas dome,

00:47:38.030 --> 00:47:43.160
because these niches are
attached to the dome.

00:47:43.160 --> 00:47:47.390 position:56%
So the calligraphy, they are not 3D,

00:47:47.390 --> 00:47:50.990
unless you're using
bricks and designing.

00:47:50.990 --> 00:47:53.940
So it is not extruding.

00:47:53.940 --> 00:47:59.880 position:56%
You are only overlapping bricks, and
making designs with tiles or bricks,

00:47:59.880 --> 00:48:05.780
and calligraphy or in patterns, but
this philosophy only exists for 3D,

00:48:05.780 --> 00:48:10.100
like the arches, and the
[inaudible], the arches forming,

00:48:10.100 --> 00:48:14.600
it was flat design, and
it extruded to become 3D.

00:48:14.600 --> 00:48:18.310
The Muqarnas is also a flat design,

00:48:18.310 --> 00:48:22.560
and it started building niches
to create this Muqarnas.

00:48:22.560 --> 00:48:25.490
So this philosophy only for 3D.

00:48:25.490 --> 00:48:28.340
Not a pattern, or a calligraphy.

00:48:28.340 --> 00:48:30.550
It is other methodologies.

00:48:30.550 --> 00:48:32.180
Using other methods.

00:48:32.180 --> 00:48:38.940
You-it is, we need to read more
about it, because I understood it

00:48:38.940 --> 00:48:41.900
in Andalusia, they
teach it in school,

00:48:41.900 --> 00:48:44.370
part of a Muqarnas philosophy.

00:48:44.370 --> 00:48:47.970
&gt;&gt; I'm sorry, this is
so fascinating to me

00:48:47.970 --> 00:48:50.300
because my background
is our history.

00:48:50.300 --> 00:48:54.390 position:56%
I wanted to find out if the churches
that were converted into mosques,

00:48:54.390 --> 00:48:58.320
because churches will
typically use human forms,

00:48:58.320 --> 00:49:02.660
and Islamic architecture does not,
were those human forms removed

00:49:02.660 --> 00:49:05.430
from all the churches that
were converted to mosques,

00:49:05.430 --> 00:49:11.670
or did they somehow re-design
them so they didn't appear as-

00:49:11.670 --> 00:49:16.370
&gt;&gt; Okay the question is the
churches that were converted

00:49:16.370 --> 00:49:21.800
into human-into human-into mosques,
that had human forms in them.

00:49:21.800 --> 00:49:24.780
Since mosques do not
use human forms,

00:49:24.780 --> 00:49:27.240
were they incorporated,
were they changed?

00:49:27.240 --> 00:49:29.670
What happened to the human
forms that were in churches,

00:49:29.670 --> 00:49:31.940
basically is that your question?

00:49:31.940 --> 00:49:33.240
&gt;&gt; Yeah.

00:49:33.240 --> 00:49:34.540
&gt;&gt; Yeah.

00:49:34.540 --> 00:49:38.090 position:56%
&gt;&gt; Example for what you have said
is [foreign word spoken], in Turkey,

00:49:38.090 --> 00:49:43.060 position:56%
they used to have Jesus drawings and
figures, but when it was converted

00:49:43.060 --> 00:49:47.510
to be a mosque, they covered
it with plasters and paints,

00:49:47.510 --> 00:49:51.000
because in Islam, they
are forbidden.

00:49:51.000 --> 00:49:59.750 position:56%
It is part of their religious
discipline, so we don't use figures.

00:49:59.750 --> 00:50:04.640
But the Ottoman empire later had
used some animals while drawing,

00:50:04.640 --> 00:50:09.660 position:56%
so every time, period of time, there
was patterns and ornamentations,

00:50:09.660 --> 00:50:13.170
that is why it is important to
travel and observe yourself.

00:50:13.170 --> 00:50:16.200
Because if you read enough
information and you see figures,

00:50:16.200 --> 00:50:20.400
you understood that maybe
other civilizations were there,

00:50:20.400 --> 00:50:23.350
and you started digging,
and understanding.

00:50:23.350 --> 00:50:31.620
So but they are basically in Islam,
figures are not allowed to be used,

00:50:31.620 --> 00:50:34.870
but normally they-yeah, just-right.

00:50:34.870 --> 00:50:43.780
&gt;&gt; I wanted to ask you about
the structure of the courtyard,

00:50:43.780 --> 00:50:48.520
you know, and what the square
form and the buildings next to it,

00:50:48.520 --> 00:50:53.540
is that a uniform thing
you find around the region?

00:50:53.540 --> 00:50:58.320
What-and what is the
original design?

00:50:58.320 --> 00:51:01.790
Why is it square courtyard?

00:51:01.790 --> 00:51:04.320
&gt;&gt; The question is about the
structure of the courtyard.

00:51:04.320 --> 00:51:09.390
Is that an original design, and
what is the basis of it, basically.

00:51:09.390 --> 00:51:10.690
Is it everywhere?

00:51:10.690 --> 00:51:11.990
Is it universal?

00:51:11.990 --> 00:51:13.290
&gt;&gt; I love your question.

00:51:13.290 --> 00:51:15.960
I love your question,
because when studying,

00:51:15.960 --> 00:51:20.500
I figured out that the mosque, the
form of the mosque would influence

00:51:20.500 --> 00:51:24.660
with two structures, a [foreign
word spoken], which is the black,

00:51:24.660 --> 00:51:29.880
if you can see in Iran there
are mosques which are cubic,

00:51:29.880 --> 00:51:31.180
which is influenced with
the [foreign word spoken],

00:51:31.180 --> 00:51:35.600
and the other one, which is
the court, was influenced

00:51:35.600 --> 00:51:38.280
with the prophet Mohammed mosque.

00:51:38.280 --> 00:51:42.250
When prophet Mohammed
moved from Mecca to Medina,

00:51:42.250 --> 00:51:48.200
and he settled there, he built a
mosque with a chunk of palm tree

00:51:48.200 --> 00:51:51.550
and mud, and there was a court.

00:51:51.550 --> 00:51:55.390
This type of plan,
called hypo-style.

00:51:55.390 --> 00:51:59.860
And it was extracted from Greek,
where they used to use lots

00:51:59.860 --> 00:52:03.480
of columns, and covered
with a platform.

00:52:03.480 --> 00:52:09.360
So, basically in Islam, during the
history of Islamic civilization,

00:52:09.360 --> 00:52:13.820
only two forms of Islamic mosques,
one is the prophet Mohammed,

00:52:13.820 --> 00:52:18.470
which has a court, and then was
developed, expanded, changed,

00:52:18.470 --> 00:52:22.050
due to the Islamic
dynasty, through history.

00:52:22.050 --> 00:52:25.580
And the other one,
which famed in Persia,

00:52:25.580 --> 00:52:29.590
and central Asia, is the cubic one.

00:52:29.590 --> 00:52:37.700
So you can see only two forms,
and like in Turkey, they started,

00:52:37.700 --> 00:52:41.490
instead of using one dome, they
started using several domes,

00:52:41.490 --> 00:52:46.080
so the elements were
changed due to the dynasties,

00:52:46.080 --> 00:52:48.550
but the form of mosque,
there are only two.

00:52:48.550 --> 00:52:52.120
And then would classify to
eight, but we're talking

00:52:52.120 --> 00:52:55.710
about the whole form,
like how to design.

00:52:55.710 --> 00:53:01.420
Some have bigger chamber hall,
less-more minaret, more minarets,

00:53:01.420 --> 00:53:04.810
the form changes, but the influence

00:53:04.810 --> 00:53:08.480
with the holy cities,
holy structures.

00:53:13.330 --> 00:53:16.830
