&gt;&gt; FERNANDEZ: My name is Peter Fernandez.
I'm the head of AdMob for Latin America. We

00:00:08.760 --> 00:00:13.730
are a mobile advertising network that was
acquired by Google within the past year. And

00:00:13.730 --> 00:00:19.210
I'm here to talk a little bit about how you
can make money with mobile applications using

00:00:19.210 --> 00:00:23.189
mobile advertising. I'm going to talk about
things like different business models you

00:00:23.189 --> 00:00:28.360
can use including advertising and other models
as well, how you can build an audience and

00:00:28.360 --> 00:00:31.650
of course, what everyone always wants to know
which is how much money can you actually expect

00:00:31.650 --> 00:00:37.129
to make. So before I get started, I actually
just wanted to ask just to understand who's

00:00:37.129 --> 00:00:41.420
in the audience, how many people here are
actually--currently have a mobile app or planning

00:00:41.420 --> 00:00:46.670
on developing one? Show of hands. Oh, a good
of amount. Great. Awesome. We love you, guys.

00:00:46.670 --> 00:00:53.190
So--then I'll just jump right into it. Starting
at the very highest level as I'm sure you've

00:00:53.190 --> 00:00:59.989
all heard, the Mobile Internet is obviously
kind of a big deal. Gartner is projecting

00:00:59.989 --> 00:01:04.710
that over one billion mobile devices will
be accessing the mobile--the Internet by 2013.

00:01:04.710 --> 00:01:09.770
I've seen plenty of other projections saying
that mobile devices are going to be bigger

00:01:09.770 --> 00:01:15.100
than regular PC Internet for accessing the
Internet within the next five or so years.

00:01:15.100 --> 00:01:19.340
And then Nielsen is projecting that smartphones
are going to overtake what we call feature

00:01:19.340 --> 00:01:25.479
phones which are your more basic WAP phones
by Q4 of 2011. That's the end of next year.

00:01:25.479 --> 00:01:31.729
So things are changing very rapidly and that's
evidenced by certain things like, for example,

00:01:31.729 --> 00:01:37.759
the amount of money that is actually being
transacted through mobile nowadays. You may

00:01:37.759 --> 00:01:41.939
have heard that last year eBay did $600 million
worth of sales through mobile applications.

00:01:41.939 --> 00:01:48.930
So these are becoming a very viable model
of commerce. And of course, one--this one

00:01:48.930 --> 00:01:54.119
survey recording here at the bottom found
that 80% of brands and advertisers are planning

00:01:54.119 --> 00:01:59.289
on boosting their mobile budgets in the coming
years. So it's something that people who advertise,

00:01:59.289 --> 00:02:02.951
people who want to reach users are thinking
about investing in. And that means that if

00:02:02.951 --> 00:02:07.789
you can build an audience of mobile users,
you have a market, you have something you

00:02:07.789 --> 00:02:12.650
can sell to advertisers and that's a great
way to build the business. Specifically in

00:02:12.650 --> 00:02:19.379
Brazil, so that you guys can understand sort
of the local context, Mobile Internet is exploding.

00:02:19.379 --> 00:02:24.300
This is a picture of our network and these
are ad requests. So you can think of these

00:02:24.300 --> 00:02:28.290
as page views. Every time--every time there's
a page view, there is also an ad request for

00:02:28.290 --> 00:02:33.769
an ad to be shown. That's what's being measured
here. As you can see over the past year, the

00:02:33.769 --> 00:02:39.569
network has grown about 800%. I mean it's
staggering. We now have about 220 million

00:02:39.569 --> 00:02:44.209
page views per month. If you compare that
to large Internet portals, I mean, that's

00:02:44.209 --> 00:02:48.819
what a large Internet portal has. So mobile
is already getting to the scale of PC on certain

00:02:48.819 --> 00:02:54.909
measures. In other words, there's a massive
audience. And the reason we have Android and

00:02:54.909 --> 00:02:59.879
iPhone pulled out separately from WAP devices
is because the behavior on those devices is

00:02:59.879 --> 00:03:04.319
fundamentally different. Those right now are
the primary devices that have full-featured

00:03:04.319 --> 00:03:10.440
Internet browsers. And so what you see is
the number of page views per device per day

00:03:10.440 --> 00:03:15.470
is just staggeringly higher than on WAP devices.
On WAP devices, you'll get someone using the

00:03:15.470 --> 00:03:19.989
mobile Internet. They'll do maybe 10 to 15
page views. On Android, it will be like 60

00:03:19.989 --> 00:03:25.769
to 100. So it's just completely--sorry--Android
and iPhone, a completely different ballgame.

00:03:25.769 --> 00:03:29.879
And of course, other manufacturers are building
other phones which are beginning to show behavior

00:03:29.879 --> 00:03:34.879
like that as well. But right now, the predominant
models that are--that show that behavior are

00:03:34.879 --> 00:03:42.900
Android and iPhone. Again in Brazil, in terms
of unique users, just so you can get a sense

00:03:42.900 --> 00:03:47.610
of how many people in Brazil are actually
currently using these devices, you can see

00:03:47.610 --> 00:03:54.439
also growing extremely fast. Only four months
ago in June 2010, there were about 450,000

00:03:54.439 --> 00:04:01.620
users total of Android plus iPhone plus iPod
Touch plus iPad. Just in September, it's basically

00:04:01.620 --> 00:04:08.360
almost doubled to 810,000. And very interestingly,
you can see the blue bar just got bigger than

00:04:08.360 --> 00:04:13.489
the red bar this past month. There are actually
now more Androids--Android devices in Brazil

00:04:13.489 --> 00:04:19.370
than iPhones, which is a pretty interesting
thing to look at. One other thing to note

00:04:19.370 --> 00:04:24.230
is that iPad is actually--although it still
looks very small, it's actually growing very,

00:04:24.230 --> 00:04:30.480
very, very quickly. So it's an interesting
platform to pay attention to. So what we do

00:04:30.480 --> 00:04:36.010
is we allow you if you are able to build an
audience among users of these devices to serve

00:04:36.010 --> 00:04:41.180
advertisements to those users. So these are,
you know, an Android app and an iPhone app

00:04:41.180 --> 00:04:45.260
in the yellow circles. Those are some of the
ads that you might get if you signed up as

00:04:45.260 --> 00:04:50.261
AdMob publisher. Basically, what you do is
you designate certain portions of your app

00:04:50.261 --> 00:04:56.540
at places where you would like to show users
ads. And then we go around and talk to advertisers

00:04:56.540 --> 00:05:02.480
and sell that inventory to them and do all--basically,
we do all the ad sales for you. So you basically

00:05:02.480 --> 00:05:09.320
just turn us on and start making money. As
far as apps go, we have SDKs for iPhone, iPad,

00:05:09.320 --> 00:05:14.571
Android and also Palm webOS. And we have a
variety of ad units which I'll show you some

00:05:14.571 --> 00:05:19.010
pictures of soon. And of course, we have very
good tracking and analytics tools to keep

00:05:19.010 --> 00:05:25.390
track of how well you're doing. Advertising
is just one piece of a business model if you're

00:05:25.390 --> 00:05:30.910
an app developer. There is a lot of different
ways you can go. So one thing we see a lot

00:05:30.910 --> 00:05:37.400
of is app developers having a free version
and a paid version. And what they'll do is

00:05:37.400 --> 00:05:43.280
they'll try to get a big audience with their
free version and then ask people to upgrade

00:05:43.280 --> 00:05:48.060
to get extra features to a paid version. So,
in other words, you know, you love this game

00:05:48.060 --> 00:05:53.210
that I've developed, you really want levels
five through ten, upgrade to, you know, the

00:05:53.210 --> 00:05:56.890
paid version and that's a good model. For
once, you've build trust with your users once

00:05:56.890 --> 00:06:02.050
the user values your app. So that's one way
that you can create revenues is by having

00:06:02.050 --> 00:06:06.970
that paid version for people to upgrade to.
The second one is in app purchases which is

00:06:06.970 --> 00:06:11.600
very similar. This would be something like
if it was a game, for example, offering extra

00:06:11.600 --> 00:06:17.570
weapons or extra avatars, that sort of thing;
a dollar for a level pack, that kind of thing;

00:06:17.570 --> 00:06:22.870
also a revenue stream. You could just have
a free app and serve advertising in it and

00:06:22.870 --> 00:06:26.680
that's obviously something that we see a lot
in our network. And then you can do pretty

00:06:26.680 --> 00:06:31.430
much any combination of those three things.
The point that I wanted to make with this

00:06:31.430 --> 00:06:37.930
slide is no matter what you want to do, advertising
serves as a solid base of revenue that is

00:06:37.930 --> 00:06:42.940
basically quite reliable. Our ad network is
very built out and there's a lot of demand

00:06:42.940 --> 00:06:47.300
for advertising on mobile devices. So if you
can build that audience, that revenue will

00:06:47.300 --> 00:06:52.750
always be there and then you can build even
more business on top of that with paid downloads

00:06:52.750 --> 00:06:58.060
and within app purchases. Advertising is just
a good baseline. One thing I would recommend

00:06:58.060 --> 00:07:03.170
however is, and I recommend this all the time,
actually is if you can have a free version

00:07:03.170 --> 00:07:07.900
of your app, you really should. We see conversion
rates on free apps. They're over 10 times

00:07:07.900 --> 00:07:12.460
higher than paid apps. It's just something
that if you're in an app store and there's

00:07:12.460 --> 00:07:17.250
200,000 apps and one is free and one is paid,
which one are you going to pick? However,

00:07:17.250 --> 00:07:20.640
if you've been using a free one for a while,
you really value it, you really like it then

00:07:20.640 --> 00:07:24.300
you're going to be more willing to pay for
a paid app. So even if you have a paid app,

00:07:24.300 --> 00:07:30.590
if you can give away a free version to get
people into it, I highly recommend that. So,

00:07:30.590 --> 00:07:34.990
on the advertising piece of those business
models, the way that AdMob works is really

00:07:34.990 --> 00:07:39.800
very easy. We have a series of SDKs available
on our website. And I'll give you guys the

00:07:39.800 --> 00:07:44.250
links to those later. You basically download
some libraries and install them in your app.

00:07:44.250 --> 00:07:48.530
It takes most app developers about two hours
to say, "This is where I want my apps and

00:07:48.530 --> 00:07:53.750
install all--this is where I want my ads and
install all of the code." And we start to

00:07:53.750 --> 00:07:59.180
show ads in your app. Generally, every time
a user clicks on one of those ads, you get

00:07:59.180 --> 00:08:04.020
paid. So--and then there's--that's the CPC
model. That's when advertisers are paying

00:08:04.020 --> 00:08:09.050
for clicks. There's also a CPM model which
is when advertisers are paying for impressions.

00:08:09.050 --> 00:08:13.160
So basically, every time an ad shows whether
the user clicks on it or not, you also get

00:08:13.160 --> 00:08:20.210
paid. You can place these banners anywhere
in your app. You can have them on menu pages,

00:08:20.210 --> 00:08:24.590
you can have them anywhere within the actual
content of the app, you can have them on instruction

00:08:24.590 --> 00:08:28.560
pages. What you should think about if you're
going to build an app that is going to be

00:08:28.560 --> 00:08:33.680
ad supported is building the app in such a
way that it optimizes the user experience

00:08:33.680 --> 00:08:39.120
because you don't want to alienate users by
having too many ads or ads in annoying places

00:08:39.120 --> 00:08:43.750
like in the middle of the screen or next to
buttons that they're trying to use for functionality

00:08:43.750 --> 00:08:47.320
so they accidentally click on the ad. You
don't want to have any of that stuff because

00:08:47.320 --> 00:08:51.840
then you'll end up losing users. So you want
to optimize for both user experience as well

00:08:51.840 --> 00:08:56.000
as revenue potential. So things like having
it on the menu screen, that's a good place

00:08:56.000 --> 00:09:01.240
to have an ad because that's when a user is
paying a lot of attention and it's not distracted

00:09:01.240 --> 00:09:08.470
by any content that your app might have. Some
examples of ad units that we serve, things

00:09:08.470 --> 00:09:13.800
that--ad types that you might receive as an
AdMob publisher, for example, Click to Call.

00:09:13.800 --> 00:09:19.010
So an advertiser might want the user to call
in, in order to sell them something. This

00:09:19.010 --> 00:09:22.380
would be some--this ad unit, when you click
on it, it actually initiates a call on the

00:09:22.380 --> 00:09:29.060
phone. Obviously, clicking to mobile landing
pages is a very common functionality for mobile

00:09:29.060 --> 00:09:34.650
advertisements. This is another thing you
might see. And then we also have a new series

00:09:34.650 --> 00:09:39.830
of advertisements called Interstitials. These
are extremely high-paying advertisements which--what

00:09:39.830 --> 00:09:46.710
they do is when someone turns on your app,
a full screen ad will actually come up and

00:09:46.710 --> 00:09:50.380
fill the screen, and it's animated, it's an
interactive experience. You can't really see

00:09:50.380 --> 00:09:54.490
it in this slide, but in the slide--in this
advertisement on the right, you can click

00:09:54.490 --> 00:09:58.250
on the clouds, move them around, the rainbow
comes out. If you touch the cloud again, a

00:09:58.250 --> 00:10:03.360
little skunk comes out. It's fun and entertaining
and most importantly, it doesn't take anyone

00:10:03.360 --> 00:10:08.210
out of your app. You can see there's a little
X mark at the top left there. At any moment

00:10:08.210 --> 00:10:12.460
if the user gets annoyed, they can click on
the X and they're right back in your app,

00:10:12.460 --> 00:10:17.150
but you still get paid for that impression.
So this is one of the things--this is one

00:10:17.150 --> 00:10:21.190
of the examples of the innovative ad units
that we have. They were always coming out

00:10:21.190 --> 00:10:25.150
with new ones to try to make sure that our
publishers are getting paid as much as possible.

00:10:25.150 --> 00:10:32.200
So everyone always wants to know how much
they can make. It really, really, really depends.

00:10:32.200 --> 00:10:36.570
Every app is completely different. And so
what I always try to do is give the people

00:10:36.570 --> 00:10:42.820
an idea of how to think about it so they can
figure it out for themselves. So what you

00:10:42.820 --> 00:10:47.750
need to think about is, "What is the value
of one of my users and how many users do I

00:10:47.750 --> 00:10:51.460
have?" And so I'm going to walk through an
example of how you might evaluate that for

00:10:51.460 --> 00:10:58.610
your own app. The first thing you need to
know is how to define eCPM. eCPM is a measure

00:10:58.610 --> 00:11:04.040
of how much money you're actually making from
serving ads. And it measures how much money

00:11:04.040 --> 00:11:09.430
you make when you serve 1,000 ads. So this
is a simplified calculation just using, you

00:11:09.430 --> 00:11:14.240
know, easy numbers to make it easy to understand
how this works. In reality, these obviously

00:11:14.240 --> 00:11:20.840
vary very widely, but let's say you serve
1,000 ads to your users. If the ads have a

00:11:20.840 --> 00:11:26.920
click through rate of 1.5%, meaning 1.5% of
the time when an ad shows, someone clicks

00:11:26.920 --> 00:11:33.530
on it, then you've gotten 15 clicks. If the
advertisers who are buying those clicks are

00:11:33.530 --> 00:11:38.470
offering to pay 10 cents per click, that's
what CPC stands for, cost per click, well

00:11:38.470 --> 00:11:43.990
then 15 times 10 is $1.50. In another words
if you serve a thousands ads, in this example,

00:11:43.990 --> 00:11:50.460
you will have made $1.50. So now you understand
what eCPM is. This will make a little more

00:11:50.460 --> 00:11:56.530
sense. This is a calculation of a value--of
the value of one free customer; meaning a

00:11:56.530 --> 00:12:02.090
customer who downloaded your free app. On
the left side, let's say you have your average

00:12:02.090 --> 00:12:09.110
user uses your app 20 times. And let's say
that the way you have your app set-up on average

00:12:09.110 --> 00:12:15.090
in one use session, a user sees five ads.
Well, that means that each user on average

00:12:15.090 --> 00:12:21.450
that you get is going to see approximately
100 ads. If your eCPM is 100--I'm sorry--$1.50,

00:12:21.450 --> 00:12:27.760
well then overall, your average value per
user is 15 cents and that's just from showing

00:12:27.760 --> 00:12:33.630
ads. The average value per user is 15 cents.
On the right side, this is saying, "How much

00:12:33.630 --> 00:12:39.390
can you make if you are also selling a paid
version to your free users?" So let's assume

00:12:39.390 --> 00:12:45.390
that people are using your free app and you
have ads running in your own app saying, "Hey,

00:12:45.390 --> 00:12:49.720
upgrade to the paid version to get all of
this great extra feature and functionality."

00:12:49.720 --> 00:12:54.450
Let's say 5% of your users upgrade to that
paid app. Let's say the price of the paid

00:12:54.450 --> 00:13:00.870
app is $2.99 then that's another 15 cents
average value per user. In other words, your

00:13:00.870 --> 00:13:06.680
average total value per user is going to be
15 plus 15 equals 30 cents. So now if you

00:13:06.680 --> 00:13:12.610
know the value of a user, then it's all just
about how many users you can get. So, obviously,

00:13:12.610 --> 00:13:17.430
the goal is get as many users as possible
and you'll make more money, and try to increase

00:13:17.430 --> 00:13:22.500
the value of your users. So this has to do
with showing more ads obviously as well as

00:13:22.500 --> 00:13:27.380
coming up with compelling offerings such as,
you know, good in app purchases, a good paid

00:13:27.380 --> 00:13:31.880
app to upgrade to and so on and so forth.
To give you an idea, one thing you might want

00:13:31.880 --> 00:13:35.901
to think about if you're thinking about types
of apps to develop is how many page views

00:13:35.901 --> 00:13:43.860
does your app drive? We see social apps, for
example, drive tons of page views. So messaging

00:13:43.860 --> 00:13:47.920
apps, Twitter apps and so on and so forth.
People are using these apps all day long to

00:13:47.920 --> 00:13:52.050
send messages, receive messages, and it's
just page views, page views, page views, same

00:13:52.050 --> 00:13:55.980
thing with games. People play games for a
very long time. So there's many, many, many

00:13:55.980 --> 00:14:00.680
opportunities to show them--to show them ads.
So those are apps that tend to have a very

00:14:00.680 --> 00:14:08.400
high value per user. Some apps have--just
by definition, they have less opportunity

00:14:08.400 --> 00:14:12.029
to show advertisement. So if you have an app
that is the kind of app that you use to get

00:14:12.029 --> 00:14:16.339
a quick piece of information, you're probably
only going to have one ad to show that person

00:14:16.339 --> 00:14:20.551
and so you might have a lower value per user.
Then again, if you can get a lot of users,

00:14:20.551 --> 00:14:24.440
you can compensate for that. So it's just
a framework for thinking about the type of

00:14:24.440 --> 00:14:30.670
app that you have and how you're going to
grow this value of that app. But of course,

00:14:30.670 --> 00:14:35.020
one goal should always be, "Get as many users
as possible," and that's also something that

00:14:35.020 --> 00:14:41.910
we try to help with. So the complication with
getting a lot of users is that app stores

00:14:41.910 --> 00:14:46.480
are really, really crowded. You know, there's
hundreds of thousands of apps in these stores.

00:14:46.480 --> 00:14:52.089
So how you're going to get noticed? We've
done research showing that something like

00:14:52.089 --> 00:14:56.380
98% of people, the way that they find the
apps that they download is they go into the

00:14:56.380 --> 00:15:00.880
app store on their phone and they just kind
of browse. And of course, when you go into

00:15:00.880 --> 00:15:04.360
the app store and you browse, what are you
browsing? You're browsing most likely the

00:15:04.360 --> 00:15:09.130
top 50 free apps. Maybe you look into a specific
category, but even there, you're also looking

00:15:09.130 --> 00:15:14.110
at the top 20 apps in that category. And so
you're going to see maybe, you know, 50 to

00:15:14.110 --> 00:15:18.620
100 apps. And they're only going to be the
top ones. And you're not going to find any

00:15:18.620 --> 00:15:23.680
of the other 200,000 apps unless you are explicitly
searching for those which doesn't happen nearly

00:15:23.680 --> 00:15:28.410
as much as just as casual browsing. So basically,
if you want to get a lot of users, it needs

00:15:28.410 --> 00:15:33.060
to be your goal to get up into that place
where you're going to be much more discoverable,

00:15:33.060 --> 00:15:38.290
where it's much easier to find you. And so
that's something that we help do through mobile

00:15:38.290 --> 00:15:43.730
advertising as well. Basically, what we allow
publishers to do through the same set of tools

00:15:43.730 --> 00:15:49.270
that we allow them to monetize their sites
through or their apps through is place advertisements

00:15:49.270 --> 00:15:55.380
for their apps on our network of other apps.
So, in this example, Battle Bears is a game

00:15:55.380 --> 00:16:00.620
that was developed by one of the developers
we work with. They put--they created an ad--what

00:16:00.620 --> 00:16:04.730
you see on the top left there. It has a little
picture of a bear and it says, "Play Battle

00:16:04.730 --> 00:16:11.850
Bears. Free download," is a very easy ad to
create. We actually scraped the--we actually

00:16:11.850 --> 00:16:16.029
scraped the image from their app tile and
they just provide 35 characters of text, so

00:16:16.029 --> 00:16:22.050
extremely easy. We show these ads across our
network. When someone clicks on an ad, it

00:16:22.050 --> 00:16:26.610
takes them directly to the app store page
to download the app. This is an example on

00:16:26.610 --> 00:16:32.350
iPhone, but it's the exact same thing on Android.
And then someone can choose to install the

00:16:32.350 --> 00:16:38.560
app or not. We've shown over time that this
is an extremely effective model and we've

00:16:38.560 --> 00:16:43.540
used it with thousands and thousands of apps.
This is just a small sampling of the apps

00:16:43.540 --> 00:16:50.399
that we've done this with. And here's a typical--here's
a typical result that you can see from this

00:16:50.399 --> 00:16:56.529
kind of campaign. We did an app promotion
campaign for a local app called Radio Skol

00:16:56.529 --> 00:17:00.741
which was produced by an app production house
called Aorta. And basically, what we tried

00:17:00.741 --> 00:17:06.880
to do is run as many ads as possible within
three or four days. And what that does is

00:17:06.880 --> 00:17:11.870
it creates a lot of downloads per day, which
means that then the app store algorithms start

00:17:11.870 --> 00:17:16.230
to increase your rank because you look like
a hot app when you're getting that many downloads.

00:17:16.230 --> 00:17:20.120
If you start increasing your rank and you
start getting up into the top 100, the top

00:17:20.120 --> 00:17:24.150
50, all those people when they're browsing
their phones, they start finding you a lot

00:17:24.150 --> 00:17:29.050
more. And so they may start downloading you
more. So just by getting up there to begin

00:17:29.050 --> 00:17:32.440
with, you're going to get up even higher just
from that organic boost effect and you can

00:17:32.440 --> 00:17:36.559
see that that's what happened here. When--before
the campaign, they were getting, you know,

00:17:36.559 --> 00:17:40.790
a very small number of downloads per day.
On the right axis there, you can see, they

00:17:40.790 --> 00:17:45.150
are probably getting maybe 30 downloads per
day. And then as we increase their rank, which

00:17:45.150 --> 00:17:48.840
is on the left side there and we got them
as high as number 10 in the app store, they

00:17:48.840 --> 00:17:54.220
were getting up to 1,200 app--1,200 downloads
a day. So if you want to build users, this

00:17:54.220 --> 00:17:59.000
is a great way to do so. And by the way, as
the app stores grow, you know, being number

00:17:59.000 --> 00:18:03.890
10 is definitely not 1,200 downloads per day
anymore. It's a much larger number because

00:18:03.890 --> 00:18:08.532
there are that many more users, that many
more apps in the app store. So to be in number

00:18:08.532 --> 00:18:14.190
10 takes a lot more downloads per user. In
other words, the opportunity to acquire users

00:18:14.190 --> 00:18:21.890
is huge. Finally, one last thing you can do
to drive downloads of your products is to

00:18:21.890 --> 00:18:28.260
cross-promote them. So if you have more than
one app, our tools allow you to use a free

00:18:28.260 --> 00:18:33.730
functionality called House ads. So if I am
the publisher of Strike Knight and Ninja Jump

00:18:33.730 --> 00:18:39.290
and I'm coming out with a new app called Buganoids,
I can actually, for free, put advertisements

00:18:39.290 --> 00:18:45.270
for Buganoids within my existing apps. And
that's a way to cross-promote my new apps

00:18:45.270 --> 00:18:49.890
to my existing users. It's completely free
to the publisher and it allows you to build

00:18:49.890 --> 00:18:55.110
on the strength of your audience creations.
So the more audience you create, the--it's

00:18:55.110 --> 00:19:01.440
a virtuous cycle. And this is--this is a free
functionality in our tool. So when you combine

00:19:01.440 --> 00:19:05.591
all of these strategies, you can build a really
strong business. This is one example of a

00:19:05.591 --> 00:19:10.580
publisher we worked with in the U.S. called
Backflip Studios, who is on our advertising,

00:19:10.580 --> 00:19:17.640
earning $100,000 a month. And they're doing
this plus CNET purchases, plus upgrade to

00:19:17.640 --> 00:19:24.010
paid versions. And there's no reason why developers
down here can't make the same kind of income.

00:19:24.010 --> 00:19:28.780
You know, earlier, I showed the number of
unique users and the number of page views

00:19:28.780 --> 00:19:32.690
in Brazil. There's no reason why you have
to have your app promoted only in Brazil.

00:19:32.690 --> 00:19:36.250
You can develop an app that can be promoted
in the app stores in the U.S. and in Europe

00:19:36.250 --> 00:19:43.620
as well. So, this sort of thing is completely
feasible and, in fact, this is just one of

00:19:43.620 --> 00:19:48.010
the--actually, many, many developer companies
who are making this kind of money right now

00:19:48.010 --> 00:19:54.820
with iPhone and Android apps. So I encourage
everyone to just give our tools a shot on

00:19:54.820 --> 00:19:59.640
admob.com. We have really good reporting and
analytics so that you can track your performance

00:19:59.640 --> 00:20:02.980
in real time. You can log in whenever you
want and see how much money you're making

00:20:02.980 --> 00:20:08.510
on a given day. You can break it down by geography.
You can design a custom dashboard. It's a

00:20:08.510 --> 00:20:14.540
very good set of tools for understanding how
your business is running. And this is how

00:20:14.540 --> 00:20:19.430
you would do that. Just check out admob.com
where you can create an account. Our SDKs

00:20:19.430 --> 00:20:23.910
are there. You can just download them for
free. And these links down here, we will take

00:20:23.910 --> 00:20:30.490
you to help center in Wikis where you could
get help on installing them. So, that's it.

00:20:30.490 --> 00:20:32.540
I tried to make it quick. I hope it was interesting.
