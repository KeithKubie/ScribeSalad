00:00:00.120 --> 00:00:03.940
We are gonna, in principle, make the most boring Sixty Symbols video

00:00:04.100 --> 00:00:06.720
'cause we're gonna talk about watching paint dry.

00:00:06.860 --> 00:00:12.440
At a macroscopic level, watching paint dry is, as you know, an incredibly boring thing to do.

00:00:12.560 --> 00:00:16.480
At a microscopic level, I wanna try and get across over the next few minutes,

00:00:16.660 --> 00:00:19.000
that not only is it interesting, it can be fascinating.

00:00:20.360 --> 00:00:30.220
So we got latex white paint. So what this is, it's 1 µm  sized - 1/1000 of a millimeter sized - spherical particles

00:00:30.220 --> 00:00:32.500
of polymer in water.

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:37.480
So that's the simplest possible paint you can use. And for physicists, that's what we really like doing.

00:00:37.560 --> 00:00:44.440
We really like and... throw away all the difficult chemistry and really, let's focus on what the physics is here.

00:00:44.520 --> 00:00:50.340
So I'm gonna take some of the paint, and to make it more straight-forward and easy to see what's going on,

00:00:50.480 --> 00:00:53.940
I'm gonna take this paint and what I've done is, I've diluted it down slightly,

00:00:53.940 --> 00:00:55.520
I've added some... just, basically water.

00:00:57.720 --> 00:01:01.940
Increase the magnification.
Now. You might be able to see these little things moving around,

00:01:02.140 --> 00:01:04.140
those are the individual particles.

00:01:04.820 --> 00:01:08.400
Let's try and focus in, and you can see they're already collecting at the edge.

00:01:08.740 --> 00:01:12.080
We should be able to go even... increase the magnification even more...

00:01:12.540 --> 00:01:18.680
So, each one of these is one of these individual µm-scale... µm-diameter particles,

00:01:18.800 --> 00:01:22.320
and you can see that they're moving across, you can see them moving around in the solution

00:01:22.560 --> 00:01:26.320
and they're joining on here, they're aggregating at the edge; they're falling out of solution.

00:01:26.500 --> 00:01:30.860
Now as we move this in and out of focus, we can see now, there's our second layer building up at the edge

00:01:31.080 --> 00:01:33.860
and you can see these little... they're joining.

00:01:34.500 --> 00:01:41.760
As the droplet dries, what's happening is that this, what we call the wetting front, or the contact line

00:01:41.940 --> 00:01:45.900
between the solvent, the substrate and air, is moving. The droplets are drying.

00:01:46.760 --> 00:01:48.980
And so we're gonna see some very interesting things happen.

00:01:49.260 --> 00:01:54.160
But it's moving now as the droplet's... basically the droplet's shrinking, and we're looking at that shrinking process.

00:01:54.320 --> 00:01:58.240
Brady: So that's moving in real time?
Prof. Moriarty: And that's moving in real time. That's absolutely moving in real time, yeah.

00:01:58.400 --> 00:02:02.920
And you'll see it starts to become pinned- let's try and focus on that. Here's another pinning event.

00:02:04.220 --> 00:02:06.300
Where you can see... and then it'll sudddenly let go.

00:02:06.800 --> 00:02:14.120
And these pinning events are very, very important where the edge of the droplet wants to move back

00:02:14.220 --> 00:02:19.040
but sometimes there's an inhomogen near the... there's a piece of dirt or there's a defect at the surface

00:02:19.040 --> 00:02:20.560
which pins it and stops it moving.

00:02:21.340 --> 00:02:27.940
And sometimes that can... and in many cases what stops it moving is when the particles themselves pile up at the edge.

00:02:28.360 --> 00:02:33.140
[I] must point out that the colors we see here are false colors - these aren't actually the colors of the solution.

00:02:33.320 --> 00:02:36.600
It's the way we're doing the experiment; we're playing around with polarization to improve the contrast

00:02:36.740 --> 00:02:41.340
so these really aren't... The colors aren't true colors as such.

00:02:41.520 --> 00:02:45.080
And in fact, you can map the color that you see onto the thickness of the film.

00:02:45.600 --> 00:02:52.800
But this is... it's exactly this type of process that, really, state of the art nanoscience - in some aspects of nanoscience

00:02:53.060 --> 00:02:57.940
is trying to exploit this process with nanoparticles, so that you can lay down regular lines

00:02:58.120 --> 00:03:02.900
of nanoparticles - much, much smaller particles than this - on surfaces.

00:03:03.460 --> 00:03:07.400
When we have a droplet of the paint on a surface, as we have here, and when you're painting it at a wall

00:03:07.600 --> 00:03:14.180
you got many- there are many, many thousands of  droplets in all sort of thin films of particles and solvent,

00:03:14.860 --> 00:03:18.980
but the key thing here - and again, here's a nice de-wetting event, or de-pinning event.

00:03:19.240 --> 00:03:23.440
You can see, what's happening is, it's piling up. Let me... Sorry, Brady, to keep interrupting.

00:03:24.460 --> 00:03:27.860
So it almost looks organic. This is purely... it almost looks like it's living, I think.

00:03:28.020 --> 00:03:32.660
But it's purely anorganic, it's just water and particles. But with fluid dynamics

00:03:33.160 --> 00:03:36.700
it does remarkably interesting things. Let me chase the front again.

00:03:37.220 --> 00:03:41.720
And this is a very, very small droplet - again, more pinning events. In this case, it's leaving particles behind.

00:03:42.200 --> 00:03:44.780
You see the particles leaking out and being left behind?

00:03:45.520 --> 00:03:46.940
Ah, that's a really nice one.

00:03:47.760 --> 00:03:52.660
That's really nice, see them just dropping out, and you can see the solvent thinning down.

00:03:52.880 --> 00:03:57.420
So, in terms of painting, this IS the painting. This is, in essence, the painting process

00:03:57.660 --> 00:04:03.880
where you want to - you have particles in a solvent, you want to get those particles, you spread them on the wall

00:04:04.020 --> 00:04:06.660
and then you want the solvent to evaporate. And here we go. So...

00:04:07.100 --> 00:04:09.620
Oh, it's moving around, that's very interesting.

00:04:09.800 --> 00:04:14.740
So you can see here, now it's stopped. We've got a lot of solvent motion still over here.

00:04:15.580 --> 00:04:20.240
And you can see the layers, the various layers of the paint particles

00:04:20.460 --> 00:04:23.660
and you can see here, it's all piling up. So as I'm changing the focus, we're just going up, the drop,

00:04:23.780 --> 00:04:27.860
you can see it moving around. That's possibly because I've been moving the focus quite a bit.

00:04:28.920 --> 00:04:32.860
And now the last part... ah.
So that's the last part of the drying.

00:04:33.020 --> 00:04:40.080
All we had was that. What's making this white is the way that the particles scatter the light.

00:04:40.300 --> 00:04:44.360
So we started off with that suspension of particles in water

00:04:44.580 --> 00:04:49.660
and so, all we've got left behind are those latex particles.

00:04:49.860 --> 00:04:55.460
And if we wanna look at that droplet, how it's dried... we are looking at a dried drop of paint.

00:04:55.940 --> 00:05:00.760
What excites me about this is that a process that seems so mundane, boring, uninteresting

00:05:01.020 --> 00:05:04.180
when you look at it in the right way, it is absolutely fascinating.

00:05:04.280 --> 00:05:09.560
And that, I guess, is what physics is all about. It's taking all the stuff that happens around us in the real world

00:05:09.680 --> 00:05:13.380
and trying to understand it, trying to interpret it, and to a certain extent, trying to control it.

00:05:13.840 --> 00:05:19.860
And I guess that's... the fundamental reason I'm most excited about that is, you got the most boring thing

00:05:19.860 --> 00:05:21.660
or what many people would consider the most boring thing,

00:05:21.820 --> 00:05:27.000
when you look at it in the right way and you think about the physics, it becomes unbelievably exciting.
