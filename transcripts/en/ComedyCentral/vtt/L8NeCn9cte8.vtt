00:00:04.804 --> 00:00:06.272
  - What a gross car.

00:00:06.305 --> 00:00:08.074
- How is that car even running?

00:00:08.107 --> 00:00:09.575
- Wait, how do I know that car?

00:00:09.608 --> 00:00:11.277
  - Does it remind you
  of the rusty pieces

00:00:11.310 --> 00:00:12.612
  of scrap metal your
  mom used to let you

00:00:12.645 --> 00:00:14.113 size:88% position:44%
   play on as a kid?

00:00:14.146 --> 00:00:14.680
   (chuckles)

00:00:14.713 --> 00:00:16.482
 - No.

00:00:16.515 --> 00:00:18.284
 Well, kind of.

00:00:18.317 --> 00:00:21.154
 Oh no.

00:00:21.187 --> 00:00:22.555
 I had sex in that car.

00:00:22.588 --> 00:00:24.223
   - How do you know?

00:00:24.256 --> 00:00:25.658
- The dice in the back.

00:00:25.691 --> 00:00:26.659
   I even made a joke
   about it because

00:00:26.692 --> 00:00:27.827
I didn't have a condom.

00:00:27.860 --> 00:00:29.228 size:88% position:44%
   I was like "let's
   roll the dice."

00:00:29.261 --> 00:00:30.229
  - Okay, first of all, gross.

00:00:30.262 --> 00:00:31.431
 Second of all, terrible joke.

00:00:31.464 --> 00:00:32.632
  This one's all you.

00:00:32.665 --> 00:00:33.566 align:start size:88% position:13%
 - No, you got...please
 you gotta take...

00:00:33.599 --> 00:00:34.667
I don't even remember her name.

00:00:34.700 --> 00:00:35.501
   - Just call her a nickname

00:00:35.534 --> 00:00:37.637 size:88% position:44%
   like baby cakes
   or strong calves.

00:00:37.670 --> 00:00:38.704
- Strong calves?

00:00:38.737 --> 00:00:39.538
  - Sweetie, whatever.

00:00:39.571 --> 00:00:40.706 align:start size:88% position:13%
  - Please, you gotta
  take this one.

00:00:40.739 --> 00:00:41.573
   - I can't.

00:00:41.607 --> 00:00:43.276 align:start size:88% position:13%
 I don't get along
 with girls like that.

00:00:44.777 --> 00:00:46.779
 - Yeah, you're right.

00:00:46.812 --> 00:00:48.514
 You probably couldn't
 sell this chick a car.

00:00:48.547 --> 00:00:50.349
- I could sell this chick a car.

00:00:50.382 --> 00:00:50.850
   - No you couldn't.

00:00:50.883 --> 00:00:52.485
 - Yes I could.

00:00:52.518 --> 00:00:53.319
   - No you couldn't.

00:00:53.352 --> 00:00:54.187
- Yes I can and I will!

00:00:54.220 --> 00:00:55.788
 - Fine, do it.

00:00:55.821 --> 00:00:58.825
(car door creaks open and shuts)

00:00:59.692 --> 00:01:01.494
- That's a nice jacket.

00:01:01.527 --> 00:01:02.762
It really brings
out your, uhm...

00:01:02.795 --> 00:01:05.031
  - Where is he? Where's Dan?

00:01:05.064 --> 00:01:05.631
   - Dan who?

00:01:05.664 --> 00:01:07.600
- Dan. About this tall.

00:01:07.633 --> 00:01:09.235
Jacked up teeth, crooked smile.

00:01:09.268 --> 00:01:10.069
Can't trust him.

00:01:10.102 --> 00:01:10.670 size:88% position:44%
   That Dan?

00:01:10.703 --> 00:01:11.637
 - Oh, that...

00:01:11.670 --> 00:01:12.438
  - You know that Dan?

00:01:12.471 --> 00:01:13.372
- Yeah, that's a very...

00:01:13.405 --> 00:01:14.474
- Likes to pick up lonely women,

00:01:14.507 --> 00:01:15.708 align:start size:88% position:13%
  maybe going through
  a tough time.

00:01:15.741 --> 00:01:17.043
 Take them out back,
 dump his load in them.

00:01:17.076 --> 00:01:18.277
   You know that Dan?

00:01:18.310 --> 00:01:22.515
- I would add in that he
has a skinny fat body.

00:01:22.548 --> 00:01:24.317
   - You're right about that.

00:01:24.350 --> 00:01:27.487 align:start size:88% position:13%
  - But he's not here.
  I can help you.

00:01:27.520 --> 00:01:29.288
 - You think you can
 cover three years back

00:01:29.321 --> 00:01:30.189
 child support?

00:01:30.222 --> 00:01:31.224
   You think you can do that?

00:01:31.757 --> 00:01:33.459
But you can't do
too much for me.

00:01:33.492 --> 00:01:34.227
So find me Dan.

00:01:34.260 --> 00:01:35.228
  Where is he?

00:01:37.496 --> 00:01:39.232
   - And that's him sleeping.

00:01:39.265 --> 00:01:40.566
  - Dogs are awesome.

00:01:40.599 --> 00:01:41.834 align:start position:0%
   - And that's him sleeping
   with his paw out.

00:01:41.867 --> 00:01:43.703
  - It's like he's
  reaching out to you

00:01:43.736 --> 00:01:44.804
from his dreams.

00:01:44.837 --> 00:01:46.639 align:start position:0%
   - And that's him sleeping
   right after he yawned.

00:01:46.672 --> 00:01:48.141
 He's fucking adorable.

00:01:48.174 --> 00:01:49.642 align:start size:88% position:13%
- Show him that
picture of him yawning.

00:01:49.675 --> 00:01:51.811
   - Shut up.

00:01:51.844 --> 00:01:53.613
Hey! What did I tell you
about running in here?

00:01:53.646 --> 00:01:55.114
  - I'm not...

00:01:55.147 --> 00:01:56.382
- Making people feel bad
with all that exercise.

00:01:56.415 --> 00:01:57.783
 - I'm not exercising.

00:01:57.816 --> 00:02:00.052 align:start position:0%
   Although you should
   exercise 23 minutes a day,

00:02:00.085 --> 00:02:01.354 size:88% position:44%
   seven to ten days a week.

00:02:01.387 --> 00:02:02.722
  - Or you could not
  and be pretty happy.

00:02:02.755 --> 00:02:04.090 align:start size:88% position:13%
  - Oh you'll be
  pretty happy to know

00:02:04.123 --> 00:02:05.358 align:start size:88% position:13%
  that there's a woman
  outside that says

00:02:05.391 --> 00:02:06.459 size:88% position:44%
   she has your baby
   and you owe her

00:02:06.492 --> 00:02:08.494 align:start size:88% position:13%
  three years of
  back child support.

00:02:08.527 --> 00:02:09.462
 - What? I have a kid?

00:02:09.495 --> 00:02:11.297
- Yeah, his name's Burt.

00:02:11.330 --> 00:02:12.465
- She named my kid Burt?

00:02:12.498 --> 00:02:13.766
   What is he, a 55
   year old mechanic?

00:02:13.799 --> 00:02:16.068
- That reminds me, I
dated a guy named Burt.

00:02:16.101 --> 00:02:17.336
He was nice. I mean, not to me.

00:02:17.369 --> 00:02:18.571
  - I can't be a dad.
  What about my band?

00:02:18.604 --> 00:02:20.339
- Oh, right, you can't be a dad.

00:02:20.372 --> 00:02:21.674
 You're a terrible role model.

00:02:21.707 --> 00:02:23.209
- What?

00:02:23.242 --> 00:02:24.377
I'd be a better role model than

00:02:24.410 --> 00:02:25.778 size:88% position:44%
   Big Gulps and hot
   dogs out there.

00:02:25.811 --> 00:02:28.281 align:start size:88% position:13%
If she wants three years
of back child support

00:02:28.314 --> 00:02:30.116 align:start size:88% position:13%
then I want three years
of back child love.

00:02:30.149 --> 00:02:31.150
- You want what?

00:02:31.183 --> 00:02:32.385
  - I want child love!

00:02:32.418 --> 00:02:34.687 align:start size:88% position:13%
Man, I immediately knew
that sounded weird.

00:02:34.720 --> 00:02:36.656
I want quality time with my son.

00:02:36.689 --> 00:02:37.690
  Give me back my son!

00:02:37.723 --> 00:02:40.160
- Maybe he's not yours.

00:02:40.793 --> 00:02:41.761 size:88% position:44%
   - Think there's a chance?

00:02:41.794 --> 00:02:42.695
- I mean, you do
smoke enough pot

00:02:42.728 --> 00:02:44.096
to make an Italian bull sterile.

00:02:44.129 --> 00:02:45.731
  - Just...can you go
  out there and like,

00:02:45.764 --> 00:02:48.701 size:88% position:44%
   see if she's got anything
   concrete or scientific?

00:02:48.734 --> 00:02:50.203 size:88% position:44%
   Anything that can
   sink me in court.

00:02:50.236 --> 00:02:52.071
- And get it notarized.
That's what holds up

00:02:52.104 --> 00:02:53.673
   in court and makes
   it easier to break

00:02:53.706 --> 00:02:55.174
them lemon laws.

00:02:55.207 --> 00:02:56.742
 - I'm not good at that
 kind of conversation.

00:02:56.775 --> 00:02:57.676
  I'm only good at
  conversations about

00:02:57.710 --> 00:03:00.313
   exercise, and yoga
   is not exercising.

00:03:00.346 --> 00:03:02.081 size:88% position:44%
   It's stretching
   and toddler mats.

00:03:02.114 --> 00:03:04.650
- Just go out there and
have some girl talk.

00:03:04.683 --> 00:03:06.719
   - I don't want to!

00:03:06.752 --> 00:03:09.555 align:start size:88% position:13%
- Oh yeah, that's right.
I forgot you can't.

00:03:09.588 --> 00:03:10.690
  - Oh, I can.

00:03:10.723 --> 00:03:11.624
- No you can't.

00:03:11.657 --> 00:03:12.291
  - Yes I can!

00:03:12.324 --> 00:03:13.125
- No you can't.

00:03:13.158 --> 00:03:14.360
- Yes I can and I will!

00:03:17.730 --> 00:03:19.365 size:88% position:44%
   - Seriously, that
   works every time.

00:03:19.398 --> 00:03:20.466
 - Cause she's stupid.

00:03:20.499 --> 00:03:21.701
(sniffs)

00:03:23.836 --> 00:03:26.239 align:start position:0%
   - Hey, Dan's out on a test
   drive with a customer.

00:03:26.272 --> 00:03:28.407
- Yeah? I'm gonna wait.

00:03:28.440 --> 00:03:29.175
- Okay.

00:03:29.208 --> 00:03:30.710
  - Sit down and eat.

00:03:32.244 --> 00:03:33.512 size:88% position:44%
   - Yeah, I'm good.

00:03:33.545 --> 00:03:36.215
- Yoga pants, sit it
down and eat something.

00:03:36.248 --> 00:03:37.583
- I don't do yoga, I'm not a mom

00:03:37.616 --> 00:03:38.718
with too much time on her hands.

00:03:38.751 --> 00:03:39.619 align:start size:88% position:13%
  - I don't care,
  nobody cares, okay?

00:03:39.652 --> 00:03:40.687
- Okay.

00:03:41.654 --> 00:03:42.755
 I'm Michelle.

00:03:42.788 --> 00:03:44.824
- I'm Dawn. With a "w."

00:03:44.857 --> 00:03:46.592
  - There's no other
  way to spell "Dawn."

00:03:46.625 --> 00:03:48.227 align:start size:88% position:13%
 - Grab yourself
 something to snack on

00:03:48.260 --> 00:03:49.695
 and sit the fuck down.

00:03:49.728 --> 00:03:52.565
  - Um, this looks good to me.

00:03:52.598 --> 00:03:53.766
(sniffs)

00:03:55.134 --> 00:03:57.570 align:start size:88% position:13%
  So, why don't you
  tell me a little bit

00:03:57.603 --> 00:03:59.639
  about Burt, you said? Right?

00:03:59.672 --> 00:04:03.709 align:start size:88% position:13%
  - Burt? Burt is
  huge. Lucky for him,

00:04:03.742 --> 00:04:07.713
he got my genes, so he's
gonna be all set there.

00:04:07.746 --> 00:04:10.149
 - Yeah, that's great.
 And what do you do?

00:04:11.116 --> 00:04:13.786
   - Bouncer for now,
   but, I'm working

00:04:13.819 --> 00:04:15.588
 on this food car idea.

00:04:15.621 --> 00:04:16.555
  - Food cart?

00:04:16.588 --> 00:04:17.657
   - Food car. C-A-R.

00:04:17.690 --> 00:04:18.591
- Okay.

00:04:18.624 --> 00:04:20.393
- Everybody else, they got those

00:04:20.426 --> 00:04:22.261
big ol' food trucks, but for me,

00:04:22.294 --> 00:04:25.197
  I'm gonna simplify,
  I'm gonna amplify,

00:04:25.230 --> 00:04:27.166
I'm gonna take it to the
streets in my food car.

00:04:27.199 --> 00:04:28.601 size:88% position:44%
   - Yeah, it's like
   you can't lose.

00:04:28.634 --> 00:04:29.702
 Do you have a picture of Burt?

00:04:29.735 --> 00:04:30.637
- Mm, a picture of Burt.

00:04:33.405 --> 00:04:34.206 size:88% position:44%
   Look at that little dude.

00:04:34.239 --> 00:04:35.575
- Oh wow, yeah.

00:04:36.709 --> 00:04:39.078 align:start size:88% position:13%
 Little is not, uh,
 the word I would use.

00:04:39.111 --> 00:04:40.813
- He's about 128 pounds.

00:04:40.846 --> 00:04:42.114
   I'm about to take
   a real quick dump.

00:04:42.147 --> 00:04:42.581
(burps)

00:04:42.614 --> 00:04:43.716
 Be right back.

00:04:43.749 --> 00:04:44.650
 - You can...there's an office.

00:04:44.684 --> 00:04:46.686
   - There's no time.
   I don't have time.

00:04:46.719 --> 00:04:51.624
 Oh, that's right. Oh, oh God.

00:04:51.657 --> 00:04:53.059 align:start size:88% position:13%
- Calm down, I got three
I don't even talk to.

00:04:53.092 --> 00:04:55.728
 (door opens and slams)

00:04:55.761 --> 00:04:56.762
 Nice entrance, Kramer.

00:04:56.795 --> 00:04:58.130
  - It's not your kid.

00:04:58.163 --> 00:04:58.764
- Are you sure?

00:04:58.797 --> 00:05:00.166
- I'm positive.

00:05:00.199 --> 00:05:00.733
- How positive?

00:05:00.766 --> 00:05:04.036
   - The kid's black.

00:05:04.069 --> 00:05:05.204
  - How black?

00:05:05.237 --> 00:05:07.039
  - Borderline purple.
  It's not your kid.

00:05:07.072 --> 00:05:09.241 size:88% position:44%
   - Wow, that's very black.

00:05:09.274 --> 00:05:11.410
  But, think about
  it. I do play bass.

00:05:11.443 --> 00:05:13.279
  So I got rhythm. I
  could be part black.

00:05:13.312 --> 00:05:14.714
- No, no, no. No to all of that.

00:05:14.747 --> 00:05:15.748
   You're whiter than
   Masters tickets.

00:05:15.781 --> 00:05:17.049
   It's not your kid.

00:05:17.082 --> 00:05:19.185 align:start size:88% position:13%
  - That's very white.
  You know what?

00:05:22.121 --> 00:05:23.556 align:start size:88% position:13%
  Now that I know
  I'm not the father,

  like a MILF quality.

00:05:25.624 --> 00:05:26.458

 - Yeah, I'd be a
 pretty good step-dad.

00:05:29.094 --> 00:05:32.231

   selling some fucking cars.

00:05:46.245 --> 00:05:47.813
 - Oh, you know, you're
 tough but you're fair.
