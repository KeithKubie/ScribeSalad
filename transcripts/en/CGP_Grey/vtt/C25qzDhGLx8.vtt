00:00:00.220 --> 00:00:03.000
When.  Do you want.  To die?

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:06.880
The Reaper is busy, but he can fit you in right now.

00:00:06.880 --> 00:00:08.820
Too soon?  Later, perhaps?

00:00:08.820 --> 00:00:11.220
Future You will keep the appointment?

00:00:11.220 --> 00:00:13.340
Old and with a life fully lived,...

00:00:13.340 --> 00:00:15.880
...perhaps ever so slightly bored and ready?

00:00:15.880 --> 00:00:17.800
Now You might think that, ...

00:00:17.800 --> 00:00:20.580
...but when the appointment whipper-snapper You set comes...

00:00:20.580 --> 00:00:24.600
...it is not in the future, because you don't live in the future.

00:00:24.600 --> 00:00:27.260
You always live in the Now.

00:00:27.260 --> 00:00:30.300
And thus, you always die now.

00:00:30.300 --> 00:00:33.360
Because the Reaper comes for all eventually,...

00:00:33.360 --> 00:00:36.540
…humans have formed a relationship with death perverse.

00:00:36.540 --> 00:00:38.920
Like a hostage who grows to love their kidnapper, …

00:00:38.920 --> 00:00:44.500
…humans tell themselves the handful of decades the reaper gives them is just the right length, …

00:00:44.500 --> 00:00:48.040
…that living a truly long and healthy life would get boring…

00:00:48.040 --> 00:00:53.480
… and would be unnatural and imagine all the problems if death took a holiday.

00:00:53.480 --> 00:00:58.480
And so the Reaper of Age whispers that he is your friend, always near: …

00:00:58.480 --> 00:01:03.420
…growing humans bigger, stronger, healthier, and smarter -- at first.

00:01:03.420 --> 00:01:05.900
Then comes his harvest of slow rot.

00:01:05.900 --> 00:01:09.920
Death is a part of life, he whispers. "Death gives life meaning,"

00:01:09.920 --> 00:01:11.740
This is madness.

00:01:11.740 --> 00:01:14.200
Misery doesn’t give happiness meaning.

00:01:14.200 --> 00:01:16.480
Happiness is meaning itself.

00:01:16.480 --> 00:01:22.500
If you tortured people to make them better appreciate the pleasures of life, you would be a monster.

00:01:22.500 --> 00:01:23.640
Just like this guy.

00:01:23.640 --> 00:01:27.200
No parent would ask the Reaper of Age to wrinkle their child's skin, …

00:01:27.200 --> 00:01:30.020
…weaken their bones, dim their vision, and their minds, …

00:01:30.020 --> 00:01:36.160
…cripple them in a thousand ways over decades to ultimately kill them, "to give their life meaning".

00:01:36.160 --> 00:01:37.420
But what can you do?

00:01:37.420 --> 00:01:39.340
The world contains pain and death, …

00:01:39.340 --> 00:01:45.240
…and so your brain believes the sweet lies that the horrors you can't avoid are good for you.

00:01:45.280 --> 00:01:48.000
And while "Death is a part of life", …

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:54.480
…cholera was a part of life until humans developed wells and sewers to separate water from waste.

00:01:54.480 --> 00:01:57.880
Shortsightedness is a part of life, until it isn't.

00:01:57.880 --> 00:02:02.200
Just because a thing is natural doesn’t make it good or necessary.

00:02:02.280 --> 00:02:06.200
It’s natural to live lives nasty, brutish, and short.

00:02:06.200 --> 00:02:12.480
And it’s natural for humans to look at what indifferent nature provides as the starting point.

00:02:12.520 --> 00:02:17.160
As a to-do list, where humans focus, technology ever improves.

00:02:17.160 --> 00:02:21.280
And with that, the ability to make lives better ever improves.

00:02:21.320 --> 00:02:23.120
And just now some basic tools, …

00:02:23.120 --> 00:02:29.480
…with real promise to slow or halt the decay are becoming visible on the horizon.

00:02:29.520 --> 00:02:33.920
Which raises the question: Just how strong is the Reaper of Age?

00:02:33.920 --> 00:02:41.280
With enough time and attention can humans craft these basic tools into shields and swords to keep him at bay?

00:02:41.280 --> 00:02:44.360
Possibly indefinitely?  Perhaps.

00:02:44.360 --> 00:02:50.160
And if so, the first immortal generation may be alive today.

00:02:50.240 --> 00:02:55.040
A generation that lives a healthy adulthood as long as they wish to.

00:02:55.040 --> 00:03:01.680
But to make that happen, brains need be cleared of the millennia of death acceptance.

00:03:01.680 --> 00:03:06.040
Death is not a solution to future problems imagined.

00:03:06.040 --> 00:03:08.880
Faced with the changes longer lives will bring,…

00:03:08.880 --> 00:03:13.720
… humans will not miss the Reaper and construct one to solve their problems.

00:03:13.720 --> 00:03:19.480
Just as with our larger cities, we don’t re-mix the water to bring back cholera.

00:03:19.480 --> 00:03:25.120
Humans must discard the learned helplessness the Reaper and their own brains have imposed on them.

00:03:25.200 --> 00:03:29.640
To instead see the rot and decay not as natural and inevitable,…

00:03:29.640 --> 00:03:33.400
… but as a degenerative disease to be attacked like all the others.

00:03:33.400 --> 00:03:41.320
As the degenerative disease that affects 100% of the population and is a source of misery untold.

00:03:41.320 --> 00:03:46.040
Misery not in your distant future, but in your now.

00:03:46.040 --> 00:03:53.360
And how soon we start the project of focusing our attention and shaping our tools against the Reaper matters.

00:03:53.360 --> 00:04:00.880
For the difference of but a day might determine what side of the future chasm you find yourself on.

00:04:00.920 --> 00:04:05.680
Journeying forever forward or falling backward into the abyss.

00:04:05.680 --> 00:04:08.120
&lt;Somber Music&gt;

00:04:08.120 --> 00:04:09.440
&lt;Kurzgesagt’s voice&gt; Is it too late for you?

00:04:09.440 --> 00:04:12.960
We probably won’t win the war against death because death is all-powerful.

00:04:12.960 --> 00:04:15.880
But we might be able to win the battle against the next best thing.

00:04:15.920 --> 00:04:16.880
Aging itself.

00:04:16.880 --> 00:04:22.000
There’s a realistic chance that you might live a longer and healthier life, but should we really do it?

00:04:22.080 --> 00:04:24.440
We explore this in our video.

00:04:24.440 --> 00:04:35.480
&lt;Silence&gt;
