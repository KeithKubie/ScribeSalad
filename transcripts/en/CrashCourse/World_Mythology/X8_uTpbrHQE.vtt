00:00:00.030 --> 00:00:04.290
Aloha I'm Mike Rugnetta, and this is
Crash Course Mythology and today we're

00:00:04.290 --> 00:00:07.500
going to continue looking at goddesses,
and what makes them so great!

00:00:07.500 --> 00:00:09.500
In this episode we'll focus on two myths:

00:00:09.500 --> 00:00:11.200
one about a volcano goddess,

00:00:11.200 --> 00:00:14.000
and another about White Buffalo Calf Woman.

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:15.630
We're going to look at these myths a bit more in-depth

00:00:15.630 --> 00:00:19.200
than we usually do, and head to places we
haven't talked about much before:

00:00:19.200 --> 00:00:22.000
Hawaii and North America.  Y'all packed, Ttoth?

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:22.600
Ooh!

00:00:22.600 --> 00:00:24.000
Ooh!
..Nice! Sharp!

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:25.500
*title music, images and jokes*

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:30.000
*jokes you'll need to pause the video to read, honestly*

00:00:33.460 --> 00:00:37.570
Longtime crash-course fans may remember
that Hawaiian mythology featured heavily

00:00:37.570 --> 00:00:39.700
in our episode about Captain Cook.

00:00:39.700 --> 00:00:42.000
The
god in question then was "Lono,"

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:47.110
who was supposed to be pretty powerful, but he
was only one of the great gods who

00:00:47.110 --> 00:00:53.020
followed Pele, the fire goddess, to Hawaii
from the land beyond the vast oceans.

00:00:53.020 --> 00:00:57.300
By the time Cook arrived in Hawaii, Pele
was the most feared and respected of

00:00:57.300 --> 00:01:02.340
Hawaii's divinities, holding court with her
five brothers and sisters in the Kilauea

00:01:02.340 --> 00:01:07.000
Volcano--which is a scary place to hold
court, but very convenient if you like BBQ.

00:01:07.100 --> 00:01:10.390
Pele exemplifies the "Triple-Goddess"
that we talked about in the previous episode:

00:01:10.390 --> 00:01:13.200
she's a goddess of life AND
death--

00:01:13.200 --> 00:01:17.000
controlling the lava that gives the Hawaiian islands its rich, fertile soil

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:20.500
but-also destroys EVERYTHING in its path.

00:01:20.500 --> 00:01:22.800
And in this story we also see her as

00:01:22.800 --> 00:01:26.000
the regenerative goddess of sexual allure and creativity.

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:30.200
In short, "This girl / is on fi-yah!" ...(emoji)

00:01:30.200 --> 00:01:34.500
One day Pele decided to come out of her smoldering pit at Kilauea to go to the beach.

00:01:34.600 --> 00:01:37.200
After frolicking in the Hawaiian surf with her sisters,

00:01:37.200 --> 00:01:39.500
she lay down for a nap in a cave.

00:01:39.580 --> 00:01:41.200
But before she fell asleep,

00:01:41.200 --> 00:01:44.800
she warned her sisters 
that if any of them woke her

00:01:44.830 --> 00:01:47.000
she would kill them all!

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:48.200
(Whoa, grouchy!)

00:01:48.300 --> 00:01:50.560
If it were absolutely necessary to awaken her

00:01:50.560 --> 00:01:52.600
she said that her youngest sister,

00:01:52.600 --> 00:01:55.100
Hi'iaka, should be the one to do it.

00:01:55.100 --> 00:01:57.900
At the time, Hi'iaka was out playing in the Lehua groves,

00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:01.200
and making friends with a tree spirit, named Hopoe,

00:02:01.200 --> 00:02:03.600
who quickly became Hi'iaka's best friend.

00:02:03.600 --> 00:02:06.580
Meanwhile, the dream
spirit of the sleeping Pele traveled to

00:02:06.580 --> 00:02:10.840
Kauai where there was a hula performance in the Alaka sacred hall.

00:02:10.840 --> 00:02:13.200
And there she found the prince Lohiau.

00:02:13.200 --> 00:02:16.900
The prince saw her and fell in love with her instantly.

00:02:16.900 --> 00:02:20.980
He invited her to eat with him
and then go back to his house.

00:02:20.980 --> 00:02:25.180
Pele allowed the prince to kiss her but not
to touch her--which is a little confusing,

00:02:25.180 --> 00:02:30.220
because, isn't kissing a kind of touching?--
anyway, the Prince tried getting handsy

00:02:30.220 --> 00:02:33.800
anyway, and Pele floated away back to
Hawaii.

00:02:33.800 --> 00:02:36.400
Distraught beyond compare,

00:02:36.400 --> 00:02:38.600
he (Lohiau) hanged himself with his loincloth.

00:02:38.600 --> 00:02:40.800
Thaught Bubble, you can take it from here.

00:02:40.810 --> 00:02:45.000
After a few days Pele's sisters grew
worried about her trance-like nap

00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:47.000
and summoned Hi'iaka to wake her.

00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:49.310
The little sister chanted over her big sister's body

00:02:49.310 --> 00:02:53.200
and the great goddess woke up (and didn't kill anyone).

00:02:53.200 --> 00:02:56.100
Pele asked each of her sisters to go to Kauai

00:02:56.100 --> 00:02:59.600
and fetch Lohiau, but they were all too afraid

00:02:59.600 --> 00:03:02.100
to make the journey--except for Hi'iaka.

00:03:02.100 --> 00:03:04.600
Pele promised the youngest sister that-

00:03:04.610 --> 00:03:09.100
-after she accomplished her task, Pele
would take Lohiau as a lover

00:03:09.100 --> 00:03:13.300
for five days and nights, 
and then he would belong to Hi'iaka.

00:03:13.300 --> 00:03:16.000
Before going, Hi'iaka made Pele promise

00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:20.100
not to destroy the Lehua groves
where her friend Hopoe lived.

00:03:20.100 --> 00:03:24.100
She also asked for some of Pele's
magic power to help her on her journey.

00:03:24.100 --> 00:03:27.140
Hi'iaka made the dangerous trip to Kauai

00:03:27.140 --> 00:03:31.800
where she found that Lohiau had been dead..
for many days.

00:03:31.800 --> 00:03:34.200
--well, mostly dead.

00:03:34.280 --> 00:03:39.080
Hi'iaka looked closely and noticed above the
prince's body a dim ghost-Spirit hovering.

00:03:39.080 --> 00:03:45.350
Using all her extra magic power
she brought Lohiau back to life.

00:03:45.350 --> 00:03:49.000
While Hi'iaka was away on her journey, 
Pele broke her promise,

00:03:49.000 --> 00:03:53.200
and her lava destroyed the Lehua groves!
--KILLING Hopoe!

00:03:53.200 --> 00:03:57.800
Hi'iaka saw this betrayal so she decided that, 
since the bargain was broken,

00:03:57.800 --> 00:04:00.100
she would take Lohiau as her own, saying,

00:04:00.100 --> 00:04:04.738
"I have faithfully kept
the compact between myself and my sister,"

00:04:04.738 --> 00:04:06.200
"I have not touched her lover,"

00:04:06.200 --> 00:04:08.200
"I have not let him caress me,"

00:04:08.200 --> 00:04:10.100
"I have not given him a kiss."

00:04:10.100 --> 00:04:12.500
"Now that compact is at an end."

00:04:12.500 --> 00:04:15.900
"I am free to treat this handsome man
 as my own lover,"

00:04:15.900 --> 00:04:18.100
"-this man, who has had a desire for me."

00:04:18.200 --> 00:04:23.500
"And I will let Pele with her own eyes see the compact broken."

00:04:23.600 --> 00:04:24.100
Thank you Thought Bubble!

00:04:24.100 --> 00:04:27.600
So that's exactly what Hi'iaka did.

00:04:27.600 --> 00:04:30.000
When their sisters saw her kissing Lohiau,

00:04:30.080 --> 00:04:31.900
they tattled to Pele, who responded,

00:04:31.900 --> 00:04:33.900
"Mouths were made made for kissing."

00:04:33.900 --> 00:04:35.900
Which makes it seem like she's okay with it

00:04:35.900 --> 00:04:38.100
--but she's definitely not okay with it.

00:04:38.100 --> 00:04:40.600
Pele called upon the other great gods

00:04:40.600 --> 00:04:44.000
to help her destroy Lohiau..

00:04:44.000 --> 00:04:45.100
which they did..

00:04:45.100 --> 00:04:46.130
with LAVA.

00:04:46.130 --> 00:04:50.100
The lava spared Hi'iaka but flowed over Lohiau

00:04:50.100 --> 00:04:51.600
who died...

00:04:51.600 --> 00:04:52.900
AGAIN.

00:04:52.900 --> 00:04:55.800
Pele, still angry, would have destroyed the world itself,

00:04:55.800 --> 00:04:59.500
but another God, Kane the earth-shaper, 
calmed her down.

00:04:59.500 --> 00:05:01.800
The story doesn't end
there though.

00:05:01.800 --> 00:05:05.600
A great sorcerer came to the pit where Pele and her sisters lived

00:05:05.600 --> 00:05:10.200
and asked them why his friend, Lohiau, had been destroyed.

00:05:10.200 --> 00:05:14.330
After the sisters told him, he asked, 
"why, since Lohiau had

00:05:14.330 --> 00:05:17.200
already died, did he have to die again?"

00:05:17.200 --> 00:05:19.400
Pele asked him to explain what he meant

00:05:19.490 --> 00:05:21.100
and the sorcerer told her

00:05:21.100 --> 00:05:26.200
about what Hi'iaka had done on Kauai to save Lohiau.

00:05:26.210 --> 00:05:27.800
Hi'iaka confirmed her deeds,

00:05:27.800 --> 00:05:30.000
explaining that she had saved him,

00:05:30.000 --> 00:05:31.100
but only smooched him

00:05:31.100 --> 00:05:34.200
after learning Pele off'd her rad tree pal.

00:05:34.200 --> 00:05:36.900
The sorcerer then asked Pele to show herself to him.

00:05:36.900 --> 00:05:39.500
He fell down and adored her,

00:05:39.500 --> 00:05:42.100
an act which seemed to soften her heart.

00:05:42.100 --> 00:05:46.400
Pele sent to her brother, Ka-moho-alii, to find Lohiau's spirit

00:05:46.490 --> 00:05:48.500
and bring him back to life.

00:05:48.500 --> 00:05:50.900
Hi'iaka found him in the charred groves,

00:05:50.960 --> 00:05:53.200
the place where the destroyed Lehua

00:05:53.200 --> 00:05:55.100
were beginning to grow again.

00:05:55.100 --> 00:05:57.100
As they wandered together through Hawaii,

00:05:57.100 --> 00:05:59.200
they knew that the goddess of the pit

00:05:59.200 --> 00:06:02.200
was not now so terror-inspiring.

00:06:02.200 --> 00:06:03.500
As a mother goddess,

00:06:03.500 --> 00:06:05.480
Pele has power over life and,

00:06:05.480 --> 00:06:06.200
Pele has power over life and,
especially,

00:06:06.200 --> 00:06:07.200
Pele has power over life and,
especially, death.

00:06:07.200 --> 00:06:09.800
Her actions are often destructive
but also..

00:06:09.800 --> 00:06:10.880
Her actions are often destructive
but also.. regenerative.

00:06:10.880 --> 00:06:11.900
By the end of the story,

00:06:11.900 --> 00:06:14.100
the Lehua groves are regrowing, and

00:06:14.100 --> 00:06:18.000
the love between her sister and the prince is rekindled.

00:06:18.000 --> 00:06:18.900
the love between her sister and the prince is rekindled. 
(wink!)

00:06:18.900 --> 00:06:20.960
While Pele's powers are terrible,

00:06:20.960 --> 00:06:23.200
we should also note that she sometimes
chooses to limit them.

00:06:23.200 --> 00:06:24.380
Pele makes threats,

00:06:24.380 --> 00:06:27.000
including the threat of killing her
sisters,

00:06:27.000 --> 00:06:28.070
but she doesn't follow through.

00:06:28.070 --> 00:06:30.500
Circumstances can also alter her
behavior.

00:06:30.500 --> 00:06:33.100
When she discovers the truth about Hi'iaka's loyalty,

00:06:33.100 --> 00:06:35.100
and her efforts to bring Lohiau back,

00:06:35.100 --> 00:06:37.200
Pele's attitude changes. She.. .

00:06:37.200 --> 00:06:38.200
Pele's attitude changes. She.. . 
cools off a bit.

00:06:38.200 --> 00:06:40.900
Does this mean that our actions towards the gods

00:06:40.900 --> 00:06:43.800
can influence their actions upon us?

00:06:43.800 --> 00:06:47.000
Or is it primarily an analogy for how we, as humans,

00:06:47.000 --> 00:06:48.900
should behave towards one another:

00:06:48.900 --> 00:06:52.100
honoring our elders, but also keeping our promises.

00:06:52.100 --> 00:06:55.000
Maybe it's just about n ot getting
hot under the collar about your sister!

00:06:55.000 --> 00:06:58.000
The creation of the social order is another aspect of

00:06:58.000 --> 00:06:59.800
great goddess mythology.

00:06:59.800 --> 00:07:02.000
One we can see echoed in our next story:

00:07:02.200 --> 00:07:03.800
The White Buffalo Calf Woman.

00:07:04.200 --> 00:07:07.200
The Lakota, Nakota and Dakota tribes who populate the northern

00:07:07.280 --> 00:07:11.360
Great Plains of the United States, and
part of Canada, are sometimes lumped under

00:07:11.360 --> 00:07:14.879
the name, "Sioux," but since that has
pejorative connotations

00:07:14.879 --> 00:07:19.000
we're going with the "D'Danke Oh Yah De," or 
"Buffalo Nation."

00:07:19.000 --> 00:07:22.200
The people of the Buffalo Nation have a complex religious system

00:07:22.200 --> 00:07:25.500
that sees the world as challenging and haphazard,

00:07:25.500 --> 00:07:27.200
forcing people to accept loss

00:07:27.200 --> 00:07:30.100
and work to complete the unfinished world.

00:07:30.100 --> 00:07:35.000
In this context the White Buffalo Calf Woman
is a culture bringer;

00:07:35.000 --> 00:07:40.169
"She gives the [Buffalo Nation People] objects
and practices that symbolize and define

00:07:40.169 --> 00:07:44.400
their way of relating to the spirit and
human worlds."

00:07:44.400 --> 00:07:46.200
This is a version of her story:

00:07:46.200 --> 00:07:46.800
Long ago

00:07:46.800 --> 00:07:49.100
the people of the [Buffalo Nation] came together

00:07:49.200 --> 00:07:51.800
at the seven sacred council fires because

00:07:51.800 --> 00:07:55.200
there was no game and the people were starving.

00:07:55.200 --> 00:07:59.200
They decided to send two Scouts to find 
something--anything--to eat.

00:07:59.200 --> 00:08:03.100
This was so long ago that it was before horses,

00:08:03.100 --> 00:08:05.900
so the scouts would have to go out on foot.

00:08:05.909 --> 00:08:10.000
The two Scouts searched everywhere,
but found nothing;

00:08:10.000 --> 00:08:12.900
until one day, they spotted a distant figure

00:08:12.900 --> 00:08:14.000
floating...

00:08:14.000 --> 00:08:15.200
floating...
not walking!

00:08:15.200 --> 00:08:16.319
--and because of this they knew that

00:08:16.319 --> 00:08:19.100
that person was "wakan," or "holy."

00:08:19.100 --> 00:08:23.500
This person was Ptesan-Wi, 
the White Buffalo Calf Woman,

00:08:23.500 --> 00:08:25.379
and she was very beautiful.

00:08:25.379 --> 00:08:28.200
Each man saw her and reacted differently.

00:08:28.200 --> 00:08:30.200
One was in awe of her,

00:08:30.200 --> 00:08:33.500
but the other was overcome.. by desire..

00:08:33.500 --> 00:08:35.000
and he tried to touch her.

00:08:35.000 --> 00:08:37.000
Instantly he was struck by lightning,

00:08:37.000 --> 00:08:39.500
and burned into a heap of black bones.

00:08:39.500 --> 00:08:41.500
So, if we've learned anything today, its that-

00:08:41.500 --> 00:08:44.000
Goddess Groping = Gruesome Death.

00:08:44.000 --> 00:08:46.000
White Buffalo Calf Woman told the other Scout

00:08:46.000 --> 00:08:50.639
that good things would come to the
Buffalo Nation people, and that he should

00:08:50.639 --> 00:08:53.200
return to camp and await her arrival.

00:08:53.200 --> 00:08:55.139
He did as he was told, and the camp

00:08:55.139 --> 00:08:57.100
prepared itself for the holy one.

00:08:57.100 --> 00:08:58.949
Four days later White Buffalo Calf Woman

00:08:58.949 --> 00:09:02.009
arrived with a bundle and was made
welcome.

00:09:02.009 --> 00:09:04.000
She told the people to create an altar

00:09:04.000 --> 00:09:07.000
and a rack for the holy thing that she had brought them.

00:09:07.000 --> 00:09:08.790
When they had done as she instructed,

00:09:08.790 --> 00:09:11.000
she opened the bundle and revealed..

00:09:11.000 --> 00:09:13.200
..the "Chanunpa," the sacred pipe.

00:09:13.200 --> 00:09:17.610
the White Buffalo Calf Woman showed the people how
to pray, and how to use the pipe:

00:09:17.610 --> 00:09:21.600
How to fill it, and sing the songs
that went along with it. She told them,

00:09:21.600 --> 00:09:25.100
"With this holy pipe you will walk like a living prayer.

00:09:25.100 --> 00:09:27.800
With your feet resting upon the Earth

00:09:27.800 --> 00:09:30.000
and the pipe-stem reaching into the sky

00:09:30.000 --> 00:09:32.100
your body forms a living bridge

00:09:32.100 --> 00:09:36.000
between the sacred beneath and the sacred above.

00:09:36.100 --> 00:09:40.800
Wakan Tanka smiles upon us, because now we are one:

00:09:40.800 --> 00:09:41.400
earth,

00:09:41.400 --> 00:09:42.100
sky,

00:09:42.100 --> 00:09:43.590
all living things,

00:09:43.590 --> 00:09:44.200
the two-legged,

00:09:44.200 --> 00:09:45.200
the four-legged,

00:09:45.200 --> 00:09:46.600
the winged ones,

00:09:46.600 --> 00:09:47.800
the trees

00:09:47.800 --> 00:09:48.700
the grasses.

00:09:48.700 --> 00:09:52.000
Together with the people, they are all related,

00:09:52.000 --> 00:09:53.200
one family,

00:09:53.200 --> 00:09:55.600
the pipe holds them together."

00:09:55.650 --> 00:09:57.200
She told them of the pipe's symbolism:

00:09:57.200 --> 00:10:00.030
the bowl and the stem were carved by men,

00:10:00.030 --> 00:10:02.900
and the decoration of the pipe was the 
work of women.

00:10:02.900 --> 00:10:08.500
The pipe binds men and women together and is used in marriage ceremonies.

00:10:08.500 --> 00:10:12.500
Women, according to the White Buffalo Calf Woman, 
are equal to men in importance

00:10:12.500 --> 00:10:14.800
because their work and their bodies

00:10:14.800 --> 00:10:16.400
keep the people alive.

00:10:16.400 --> 00:10:18.700
"You are
from the mother earth,"

00:10:18.700 --> 00:10:19.350
she told the women.

00:10:19.350 --> 00:10:22.900
"What you are doing is as great as what
the warriors do."

00:10:22.900 --> 00:10:25.500
The White Buffalo Calf Woman gave many gifts to the Buffalo Nation

00:10:25.500 --> 00:10:27.500
including corn, wild turnips,

00:10:27.600 --> 00:10:30.500
and the knowledge of how to cook wild turnips,

00:10:30.500 --> 00:10:32.200
which--I mean, I sure as heck wouldn't know so,

00:10:32.200 --> 00:10:33.800
thanks Ptesan-Wi!

00:10:33.800 --> 00:10:35.200
She told the people that they were special,

00:10:35.200 --> 00:10:38.500
and that this was why they had been
given the Chanunpa.

00:10:38.500 --> 00:10:41.800
Most important, when the White Buffalo Calf woman
left the people,

00:10:41.800 --> 00:10:43.800
promising that she would see them again,

00:10:43.800 --> 00:10:46.500
the great buffalo herds appeared,

00:10:46.500 --> 00:10:48.200
allowing themselves to be killed-

00:10:48.200 --> 00:10:50.500
-so that people could eat and live.

00:10:50.500 --> 00:10:51.900
Unlike the Pele story,

00:10:51.900 --> 00:10:54.600
Ptesan-Wi's interactions are mostly with humans

00:10:54.600 --> 00:10:55.600
and with groups

00:10:55.600 --> 00:10:58.000
rather than other gods or individuals.

00:10:58.000 --> 00:11:01.200
And rather than being mercurial,
 the White Buffalo Calf Woman

00:11:01.200 --> 00:11:03.800
offers a sense of order,

00:11:03.800 --> 00:11:07.000
and a sense that the right behavior will be rewarded.

00:11:07.000 --> 00:11:10.100
In short, great goddesses are powerful,

00:11:10.100 --> 00:11:12.700
great goddesses are desirable,

00:11:12.700 --> 00:11:14.100
the goddesses giveth,

00:11:14.100 --> 00:11:16.800
and the great goddesses taketh away.

00:11:16.800 --> 00:11:20.570
And, in a way, they suggest a relationship
between the sacred and the profane;

00:11:20.570 --> 00:11:23.800
teetering, like many deities, on a line between

00:11:23.800 --> 00:11:27.900
worldly desire and otherworldly authority.

00:11:27.900 --> 00:11:30.200
So, maybe most importantly,
remember:

00:11:30.200 --> 00:11:31.830
terrible things will happen to you

00:11:31.830 --> 00:11:34.000
if you try to touch a great goddess
without permission.

00:11:34.400 --> 00:11:36.000
Consent is Sexy!

00:11:37.000 --> 00:11:38.200

"Mouths were made for kissing!"

00:12:19.800 --> 00:12:24.000
"Mouths were made for kissing!"
*smooch*
