00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.401
Bees play a crucial role on Earth - some even
claim that if they go extinct, humanity would

00:00:04.401 --> 00:00:10.071
be next. So with the dramatic decline in bee
population, should we be worried? What happens

00:00:10.071 --> 00:00:11.771
if the bees all die?

00:00:11.771 --> 00:00:15.751
Simply put, if a plant produces a flower,
you can bet that bees help them reproduce.

00:00:15.751 --> 00:00:19.631
This long-standing, working relationship evolved
with flowers being bright and fragrant to

00:00:19.631 --> 00:00:24.011
attract bees, and the bees fuzzy, velcro-like
bodies helping them to efficiently transfer

00:00:24.011 --> 00:00:28.111
pollen from the male part of the plant to
the female part. This seemingly simple mechanism

00:00:28.111 --> 00:00:33.250
is directly responsible for the production
of 70% of fruits, vegetables, seeds and nuts

00:00:33.250 --> 00:00:40.250
that we consume on a daily basis. 70%! Which
translates into almost $200 billion in global

00:00:40.250 --> 00:00:45.110
agriculture revenue. This huge responsibility
is accomplished by droves of commercial bees,

00:00:45.110 --> 00:00:48.980
reared by professional beekeepers for the
sole purpose of being transported to farms

00:00:48.980 --> 00:00:50.811
and orchards to pollinate crops.

00:00:50.811 --> 00:00:55.581
But since 2006, these hardworking, busy bees
have been mysteriously disappearing. This

00:00:55.581 --> 00:00:59.930
Colony Collapse Disorder has seen an average
of 1/3rd of commercial bees abandoning their

00:00:59.930 --> 00:01:05.371
hives. In fact, some beekeepers have even
reported that 90% of their bees have simply

00:01:05.371 --> 00:01:06.121
buzzed off.

00:01:06.121 --> 00:01:10.281
In some colonies, mites, viruses and parasites
have been to blame, but many are now looking

00:01:10.281 --> 00:01:15.361
at a class of insecticides called neonicotinoids.
This neurotoxin is used to kill off crop eating

00:01:15.361 --> 00:01:19.401
insects and pests, but also affects the central
nervous systems of bees when they consume

00:01:19.401 --> 00:01:24.851
contaminated nectar. And since nectar is brought
back to hives, the entire colony can be affected,

00:01:24.851 --> 00:01:29.981
leading to mass confusion and disorientation.
On top of this, other factors such as extremely

00:01:29.981 --> 00:01:34.831
cold and long winters, a lack of genetic diversity
in commercial bees, and less variable nectar

00:01:34.831 --> 00:01:36.601
in the fields may be at fault.

00:01:36.601 --> 00:01:41.501
If the trend continues, entire food chains
and webs may be at risk. Take almond plants

00:01:41.501 --> 00:01:46.181
for example; the hulls of these nuts are used
as feed for farm cattle and chickens. Fewer

00:01:46.181 --> 00:01:51.281
bees means fewer almonds, which could mean
declining livestock, and ultimately less milk,

00:01:51.281 --> 00:01:56.281
cheese, eggs and meat production. Not to mention
almonds are used in cereal, baking and many

00:01:56.281 --> 00:02:00.731
other food products. Beef and dairy cows would
also be harshly affected by the vanishing

00:02:00.731 --> 00:02:06.330
alfalfa fields which are used to harvest hay
for cattle. Looking for a morning buzz? Considering

00:02:06.330 --> 00:02:11.731
bees pollinate Coffea arabica, whose seeds
we grind for coffee, you can count that out.

00:02:11.731 --> 00:02:16.970
Without bees, our diet would consist of mostly
corn, wheat and rice, as they are wind pollinated

00:02:16.970 --> 00:02:17.451
plants.

00:02:17.451 --> 00:02:21.541
Like your clothes? Not only is cotton the
biggest cash crop in the US, it also makes

00:02:21.541 --> 00:02:27.711
up about 35% of the world’s fiber use. So
you can forget those blue jeans, towels, mattresses

00:02:27.711 --> 00:02:29.871
and high quality paper products.

00:02:29.871 --> 00:02:33.431
Simply put, we’d be living in a completely
different world without bees, not to mention

00:02:33.431 --> 00:02:38.321
suffering a substantial economic strain from
their disappearance. So while we may not necessarily

00:02:38.321 --> 00:02:42.440
go ‘extinct’ should the downward trend
persist, a world without the buzz of bees

00:02:42.440 --> 00:02:43.880
would definitely…sting!

00:02:43.880 --> 00:02:49.280
