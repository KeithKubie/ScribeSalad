00:00:01.580 --> 00:00:04.040
WE ALL SPEND ROUGHLY
A THIRD OF OUR LIVES ASLEEP

00:00:05.600 --> 00:00:07.660
ACCESSING DREAM WORLDS IN OUR SUBCONSCIOUS

00:00:07.660 --> 00:00:09.600
THAT ARE LOST BY THE TIME WE WAKE UP.

00:00:10.840 --> 00:00:13.040
BUT WHAT IF THEY DIDN’T HAVE TO BE?

00:00:41.140 --> 00:00:44.720
JUDITH AMORES AND THE ENGINEERS, NEUROSCIENTISTS, AND DESIGNERS SHE WORKS WITH

00:00:44.720 --> 00:00:47.360
AT MIT’S MEDIA LAB,
DUBBED “THE DREAM TEAM,"

00:00:47.360 --> 00:00:49.480
ARE WORKING TO DECODE THE UNCONSCIOUS MIND.

00:00:49.820 --> 00:00:51.680
BUT THESE ARE NO ORDINARY SLEEP SCIENTISTS.

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:54.003
THEY DON’T JUST WANT TO UNDERSTAND THE ROLE

00:00:54.003 --> 00:00:55.780
THAT SLEEP AND DREAMS CAN PLAY IN OUR LIVES;

00:00:56.100 --> 00:00:57.740
THEY THINK WE CAN ACTUALLY TINKER WITH IT.

00:01:14.940 --> 00:01:17.920
SLEEP HAS LONG BEEN RECOGNIZED 
NOT ONLY FOR BEING THERAPEUTIC,

00:01:17.920 --> 00:01:19.780
BUT ALSO A SOURCE OF INSPIRATION.

00:01:20.180 --> 00:01:23.280
VISIONARIES LIKE NIKOLA TESLA 
HAVE USED HYPNAGOGIA,

00:01:23.280 --> 00:01:25.080
THE STATE OF BEING HALF ASLEEP,

00:01:25.080 --> 00:01:27.280
TO DOZE THEIR WAY TO SOME 
OF THE WORLD’S MOST ICONIC

00:01:27.280 --> 00:01:28.580
ART AND INVENTIONS.

00:01:50.780 --> 00:01:53.220
TO HARNESS THIS POTENTIAL, 
THE DREAM TEAM IS EXPLORING

00:01:53.220 --> 00:01:55.560
THE WORLD OF ‘HUMAN-MACHINE SYMBIOSIS...’

00:01:55.560 --> 00:01:58.740
THAT IS, DESIGNING TECHNOLOGY
INTENDED FOR SEAMLESS INTEGRATION

00:01:58.740 --> 00:02:00.320
INTO YOUR LIFE... AND YOUR BODY.

00:02:00.680 --> 00:02:02.280
AND IF THAT SOUNDS STRAIGHT OUT OF SCI-FI…

00:02:02.280 --> 00:02:03.280
IT IS.

00:02:04.140 --> 00:02:06.469
THE DREAM TEAM RECENTLY DEBUTED DORMIO,

00:02:06.469 --> 00:02:08.220
A GLOVE DESIGNED TO BOOST CREATIVITY.

00:02:08.740 --> 00:02:11.040
DORMIO RECOGNIZES A HYPNAGOGIC STATE,

00:02:11.040 --> 00:02:14.640
TRIGGERS A ROBOTIC VOICE TO READ YOU
AN AUDIO CUE OR CREATIVE PROMPT

00:02:14.640 --> 00:02:17.980
IN YOUR SLEEP, AND RECORDS
YOUR MUMBLED RESPONSE.

00:02:43.340 --> 00:02:46.270
BUT WHAT ABOUT OUR SLEEP STATES 
BEYOND HYPNAGOGIA?

00:02:46.270 --> 00:02:48.600
THE DREAM TEAM IS DEVELOPING 
ADDITIONAL PROTOTYPES

00:02:48.600 --> 00:02:51.560
TO ANALYZE EVEN MORE OF
YOUR BODY’S BIOLOGICAL CUES.

00:02:51.840 --> 00:02:55.060
A DEEP LEARNING COMPUTER MODEL THEN DECIPHERS THIS INFORMATION

00:02:55.060 --> 00:02:57.500
TO DETERMINE WHAT STAGE 
OF SLEEP A PERSON IS IN.

00:03:24.700 --> 00:03:26.540
TARGETING ONE OR MORE OF THESE SLEEP STAGES

00:03:26.540 --> 00:03:30.220
COULD BE LIKE FINDING THE SECRET ENTRANCE 
TO YOUR OWN SUBCONSCIOUS.

00:03:30.780 --> 00:03:34.160
THE CHALLENGE IS ACTUALLY OPENING THAT DOOR
WITHOUT WAKING YOU UP.

00:03:34.160 --> 00:03:38.430
SO THE DREAM TEAM IS ON THE HUNT FOR SIGNALS
OR STIMULI THAT CAN DO JUST THAT.

00:03:38.430 --> 00:03:43.000
AND JUDITH HAS SNIFFED OUT A PARTICULARLY
USEFUL TOOL: OUR SENSE OF SMELL.

00:04:19.860 --> 00:04:23.160
DURING YOUR SLEEP, THIS DEVICE COULD
BE PROGRAMMED TO RELEASE A SCENT

00:04:23.160 --> 00:04:26.320
FAMILIAR TO YOU, THAT YOU’VE ALREADY ASSOCIATED WITH A LEARNED BEHAVIOR

00:04:26.320 --> 00:04:29.120
SUCH AS SMELLING ROSE WHILE YOU 
STUDY A NEW LANGUAGE.

00:04:44.760 --> 00:04:47.360
THE TOYS AND TOOLS DREAMED UP
IN THE MEDIA LAB ARE USUALLY

00:04:47.360 --> 00:04:49.560
CONTROLLED BY A SIMPLE SMARTPHONE APP,

00:04:49.560 --> 00:04:52.260
MAKING IT EASIER FOR PEOPLE
TO GET THE RESULTS THEY WANT

00:04:52.260 --> 00:04:55.620
WHETHER IT’S FACING YOUR FEARS
IN A DREAM, BREAKING A BAD HABIT,

00:04:55.620 --> 00:04:56.900
OR JUST GETTING A BETTER NIGHT’S REST.

00:05:24.820 --> 00:05:29.180
AND FOR JUDITH AND HER TEAM, PAVING THE WAY
FOR THAT MUTUAL SYMBIOSIS WITH TECHNOLOGY

00:05:29.200 --> 00:05:31.000
IS WHAT THE FUTURE IS ALL ABOUT.

00:06:06.260 --> 00:06:08.520

BY THE U.S. AIR FORCE.
