00:00:00.284 --> 00:00:03.721
- A movie theater charges $10.50 per ticket

00:00:03.721 --> 00:00:06.693
and $5 per bucket of popcorn.

00:00:06.693 --> 00:00:08.655
You never buy the popcorn because you think

00:00:08.655 --> 00:00:10.756
it's too expensive.

00:00:10.756 --> 00:00:13.754
Is the total price you pay proportional to the number

00:00:13.754 --> 00:00:16.155
of tickets you buy?

00:00:16.155 --> 00:00:18.777
This is interesting, because they tell us the price

00:00:20.047 --> 00:00:22.023
of a bucket of popcorn, but then they tell us

00:00:22.023 --> 00:00:23.927
that we never buy the popcorn.

00:00:23.927 --> 00:00:24.995
So I guess, I don't know they even told us

00:00:24.995 --> 00:00:27.386
what the price is; maybe to confuse us.

00:00:27.386 --> 00:00:29.256
Is the total price you pay proportional

00:00:29.256 --> 00:00:30.985
to the number of tickets you buy?

00:00:30.985 --> 00:00:32.309
Well, you're only buying tickets;

00:00:32.309 --> 00:00:34.155
you're not gonna be buying any popcorn,

00:00:34.155 --> 00:00:38.091
so yeah, you're gonna spend $10.50 for every ticket,

00:00:38.091 --> 00:00:39.519
so it should be proportional.

00:00:39.519 --> 00:00:41.551
Just to see that a little bit clearer,

00:00:41.551 --> 00:00:44.488
let's draw a little table here.

00:00:44.488 --> 00:00:46.236
So, number of tickets;

00:00:49.387 --> 00:00:52.394
and then price, the total price.

00:00:52.394 --> 00:00:54.461
We're assuming I never buy the popcorn.

00:00:54.461 --> 00:00:58.617
So, if I buy one ticket, the price is going to be 10.50.

00:00:58.617 --> 00:01:01.717
If I buy two tickets, it's gonna be two times 10.50,

00:01:01.717 --> 00:01:06.187
or $21.00.

00:01:06.187 --> 00:01:08.660
If I buy three tickets, gonna be three times 10.50,

00:01:08.660 --> 00:01:09.322
which is what?

00:01:09.322 --> 00:01:11.510
31.50.

00:01:13.559 --> 00:01:16.712
And so, you can see the ratio between price

00:01:17.652 --> 00:01:19.528
and number of tickets,

00:01:21.152 --> 00:01:22.754
it's always going to be 10.50.

00:01:22.754 --> 00:01:23.892
10.50 divided by one;

00:01:23.892 --> 00:01:25.320
21 divided by two;

00:01:25.320 --> 00:01:27.050
31.50 divided by three;

00:01:27.050 --> 00:01:29.627
it's always going to be 10.50.

00:01:29.627 --> 00:01:32.356
That's 'cause the price, put another way,

00:01:32.356 --> 00:01:35.009
the price is just going to be 10.50

00:01:35.827 --> 00:01:38.341
times the number of tickets.

00:01:41.760 --> 00:01:44.506
So, clearly a proportional relationship.
