00:00:01.501 --> 00:00:02.585
- Ooh, dude, look at that.

00:00:02.585 --> 00:00:03.712
Look at that.
Look at that.

00:00:03.712 --> 00:00:04.796
The Falcon.
The Falcon.

00:00:04.796 --> 00:00:07.674
They are gassing.
Get that.

00:00:07.674 --> 00:00:10.218
Ooh, that thing is wicked.

00:00:10.218 --> 00:00:12.220
[horn]

00:00:12.220 --> 00:00:14.347
Hey, you mind if we
talk about your Falcon?

00:00:14.347 --> 00:00:15.598
That's cool.

00:00:15.598 --> 00:00:17.142
Oh, that is definitely
my kind of car.

00:00:20.186 --> 00:00:23.064
Whoo.

00:00:23.064 --> 00:00:25.525
This is bad-ass.

00:00:25.525 --> 00:00:26.943
- Hi, guys.
- How are doing, man.

00:00:26.943 --> 00:00:27.652
How are you doing?

00:00:27.652 --> 00:00:28.820
I'm Ryan.

00:00:28.820 --> 00:00:29.988
I'm Don.

00:00:29.988 --> 00:00:31.030
So you guys are
cruising the hood?

00:00:31.030 --> 00:00:33.116
- Yeah.
- Looking for cars?

00:00:33.116 --> 00:00:34.534
Looking for cars.

00:00:34.534 --> 00:00:36.161
You crossed our path
like go get it, get it,

00:00:36.161 --> 00:00:37.120
we've got to get that.

00:00:37.120 --> 00:00:39.330
This is a bad ass Falcon.

00:00:39.330 --> 00:00:40.874
This is '61.

00:00:40.874 --> 00:00:42.876
I had a '63 when I
was in high school.

00:00:42.876 --> 00:00:44.043
So when I saw this
I had to get it.

00:00:44.043 --> 00:00:45.754
Whoo.
Yeah.

00:00:45.754 --> 00:00:48.047
Drivers began muscling up and
racing Ford Falcons turning

00:00:48.047 --> 00:00:50.091
them into gassers
almost immediately

00:00:50.091 --> 00:00:52.552
after their debut in 1959.

00:00:52.552 --> 00:00:56.097
Their light, strong, build made
it perfect for the drag strip.

00:00:56.097 --> 00:00:57.724
Ford took the hint
and started designing

00:00:57.724 --> 00:00:59.350
the Falcon with racing in mind.

00:00:59.350 --> 00:01:01.895
By the time the 1961
model hit the floor,

00:01:01.895 --> 00:01:04.773
it came with a bigger engine
and an additional sport model

00:01:04.773 --> 00:01:06.941
making it even more
attractive to buyers

00:01:06.941 --> 00:01:11.070
who were interested in only
one thing, performance.

00:01:11.070 --> 00:01:12.447
Can we pop the
hood on this bad boy?

00:01:12.447 --> 00:01:13.823
We've got to see the
motor on this thing.

00:01:13.823 --> 00:01:17.452
- Pop the hood.
- Certainly.

00:01:17.452 --> 00:01:20.079
This is either a
327, or it's a 350.

00:01:20.079 --> 00:01:21.664
I've been told both by
two different mechanics.

00:01:21.664 --> 00:01:22.791
- Right.
- Same block.

00:01:22.791 --> 00:01:23.958
It's nice because
it's still warm.

00:01:23.958 --> 00:01:25.293
[laughter]
- This is a real gasser.

00:01:25.293 --> 00:01:27.128
I mean it's got a
straight axle, it's got

00:01:27.128 --> 00:01:29.047
the short stack headers on it.

00:01:29.047 --> 00:01:30.590
And this thing is
a four speed car.

00:01:30.590 --> 00:01:31.549
This is a true gasser.

00:01:31.549 --> 00:01:32.509
This is a race car.

00:01:32.509 --> 00:01:33.218
Yep.

00:01:33.218 --> 00:01:34.594
Man.

00:01:34.594 --> 00:01:36.554
I took it up to
the strip, it was

00:01:36.554 --> 00:01:38.056
probably about three years ago.

00:01:38.056 --> 00:01:40.475
I was getting about 12,1,
12,2 at a quarter mile.

00:01:40.475 --> 00:01:42.018
Shoo, that's cooking.

00:01:42.018 --> 00:01:43.978
This thing had to have
been fun in the drag strip?

00:01:43.978 --> 00:01:44.771
Oh, it was.

00:01:44.771 --> 00:01:46.523
Yeah, it was.

00:01:46.523 --> 00:01:48.608
Because it was one or two cars
out of 300 that was old school.

00:01:48.608 --> 00:01:50.109
Right.

00:01:50.109 --> 00:01:51.110
The drag strip these days,
you're not going to see

00:01:51.110 --> 00:01:52.779
too many gassers out there.

00:01:52.779 --> 00:01:54.155
Everything is a new car.

00:01:54.155 --> 00:01:56.032
Fuel injection, right
out of the factory.

00:01:56.032 --> 00:01:57.242
- Those aren't fun.
- Oh, no.

00:01:57.242 --> 00:01:58.076
You got this for what?

00:01:58.076 --> 00:01:59.327
- 14.
- 14?

00:01:59.327 --> 00:02:00.745
- Yeah.
- Wow.

00:02:00.745 --> 00:02:02.247
You going to make me an offer?

00:02:02.247 --> 00:02:03.748
[laughter]

00:02:03.748 --> 00:02:05.750
Well, hey, come
down to the shop.

00:02:05.750 --> 00:02:07.210
I'm sure Danny would
love to check it out.

00:02:07.210 --> 00:02:08.294
- Yeah, I'll do it.
- Oh, please, man.

00:02:08.294 --> 00:02:09.963
Yeah.
That would be very cool.

00:02:09.963 --> 00:02:11.923
All right.
I'll open the second header.

00:02:11.923 --> 00:02:13.591
You guys can hear
it when I take off.

00:02:13.591 --> 00:02:16.177
Man, this car is cool as hell.

00:02:16.177 --> 00:02:18.179
But I have no idea
what to offer this guy.

00:02:18.179 --> 00:02:20.431
So he wants to sell it, he needs
to bring it down to the shop

00:02:20.431 --> 00:02:21.850
and talk to the boss
man because he's

00:02:21.850 --> 00:02:22.851
the one with the checkbook.

00:02:22.851 --> 00:02:24.561
[reeving engine]
- Oh, man.

00:02:28.147 --> 00:02:32.443
[laughter] Here we go!

00:02:37.490 --> 00:02:39.450
Stand that bad boy up.

00:02:39.450 --> 00:02:41.411
Yeah.

00:02:41.411 --> 00:02:42.704
That is bad ass.

00:02:42.704 --> 00:02:43.705
That's a bad car right there.
