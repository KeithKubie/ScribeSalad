00:00:01.001 --> 00:00:03.003
Samsung is officially
discontinuing

00:00:03.036 --> 00:00:05.005
their Galaxy Note 7 smartphone

00:00:05.038 --> 00:00:06.707
'cause they've been randomly
bursting into flames,

00:00:06.740 --> 00:00:10.310
like grandma falling asleep
with a cigarette in her mouth.

00:00:10.344 --> 00:00:11.678
-(laughter)
-Let it go. She's gone.

00:00:11.712 --> 00:00:13.680
Combine a Samsung...
combine a Samsung

00:00:13.714 --> 00:00:15.983
with a hoverboard
and discount vape pen,

00:00:16.016 --> 00:00:17.417
and you've got a great ensemble

00:00:17.451 --> 00:00:18.852
for that hip,
tech-savvy millennial

00:00:18.886 --> 00:00:21.388
-who loves being on fire
all the time. -(laughter)

00:00:21.421 --> 00:00:25.259
But there are some brilliant
<i>Grand Theft Auto</i> modders

00:00:25.292 --> 00:00:27.928
who have added the Galaxy
to the game's weapon store.

00:00:27.961 --> 00:00:30.898
-Take a look.
-(laughter)

00:00:30.931 --> 00:00:33.166
-â™ª
-(laughter)

00:00:37.371 --> 00:00:39.606
(laughter)

00:00:39.640 --> 00:00:42.342
(applause and cheering)

00:00:42.376 --> 00:00:44.778
HARDWICK:
Ah.

00:00:44.811 --> 00:00:47.347
Mwah. Mwah.

00:00:47.381 --> 00:00:49.449
I mean, sure, you know,
it looks dangerous,

00:00:49.483 --> 00:00:51.685
but at least
it has a headphone jack!

00:00:51.718 --> 00:00:54.521
No, I have not been mad
about this for too long!

00:00:54.555 --> 00:00:56.623
You haven't been mad
about it long enough!

00:00:56.657 --> 00:00:58.659
I mean, yeah,
I have iPhone 7 Plus,

00:00:58.692 --> 00:01:01.128
and the pictures are amazing,
particularly in low light,

00:01:01.161 --> 00:01:03.163
but I just want headphones,

00:01:03.197 --> 00:01:06.033
which is why God put two holes
in a phone!

00:01:06.066 --> 00:01:09.837
It's headphone jack,
not headphone and Steve!

00:01:09.870 --> 00:01:13.774
-(laughter)
-Comedians, uh, this looks...

00:01:13.807 --> 00:01:16.143
-What just happened?
Comedians... -(laughter)

00:01:16.176 --> 00:01:18.145
This looks really bad
for Samsung,

00:01:18.178 --> 00:01:20.180
but they are the world's
biggest smartphone maker.

00:01:20.214 --> 00:01:23.851
So, can they come back
from this scandal?

00:01:23.884 --> 00:01:26.053
-Ron Funches. -Oh, yeah.
They'll be just fine.

00:01:26.086 --> 00:01:28.388
-(laughter) -Like,
I don't know if you noticed,

00:01:28.422 --> 00:01:30.824
but this entire year
has been a Dumpster fire, so...

00:01:30.858 --> 00:01:32.226
HARDWICK:
Yeah, that's true.

00:01:32.259 --> 00:01:34.094
-(laughter)
-That's true. Yeah, points.

00:01:34.127 --> 00:01:35.462
Uh, Al Jackson.

00:01:35.495 --> 00:01:37.698
Dude, they got to spin it, man.
Samsung's got to be like,

00:01:37.731 --> 00:01:39.800
"Look, this only happens
to our phone

00:01:39.833 --> 00:01:42.069
if you like your own statuses
on social media."

00:01:42.102 --> 00:01:44.304
-Yeah, that's a great idea.
-(laughter, applause)

00:01:44.338 --> 00:01:46.573
-Points. Bobby Lee. -Of course,
they're gonna survive.

00:01:46.607 --> 00:01:49.476
They're Korean like I am,
and we created "Gangnam Style."

00:01:49.510 --> 00:01:52.913
-HARDWICK: All right, points.
Points. -(applause and cheering)

00:01:52.946 --> 00:01:53.013
Yup.
