00:00:07.120 --> 00:00:09.540
By its very nature, television is generally
scripted.

00:00:09.540 --> 00:00:13.590
Whether it's an actor performing in an episodic
drama or comedy, an anchorperson presenting

00:00:13.590 --> 00:00:18.250
the latest world news, or a quiz host welcoming
an audience to a show, almost everyone who

00:00:18.250 --> 00:00:22.820
appears on TV says and does exactly what they're
supposed to.But that isn't always the case

00:00:22.820 --> 00:00:27.130
- and we're not just talking about specifically
improvised shows like Whose Line Is It Anyway?

00:00:27.130 --> 00:00:30.330
Even shows that are scripted have featured
moments in which actors and performers have

00:00:30.330 --> 00:00:34.250
gone off script - and sometimes with great
results.In this video, we're going to run

00:00:34.250 --> 00:00:37.780
through some of the best off-the-cuff moments
to have been aired on television - both in

00:00:37.780 --> 00:00:39.920
live action and animated shows.

00:00:39.920 --> 00:00:44.550
Here are ten hilarious improvised TV moments
you have to see.

00:00:44.550 --> 00:00:48.280
Friends
Friends is one of the most iconic and beloved

00:00:48.280 --> 00:00:51.969
television shows of all time - and one of
the most brilliant lines from the hit sitcom

00:00:51.969 --> 00:00:55.289
came courtesy of some great Jennifer Anniston
improvisation.

00:00:55.289 --> 00:00:59.249
It was in the episode The One After Vegas,
when Ross and Rachel woke up after a drunken

00:00:59.249 --> 00:01:02.819
evening in Sin City with no recollection of
the fact that they had gotten married to each

00:01:02.819 --> 00:01:04.170
other the night before.

00:01:04.170 --> 00:01:08.140
When they were informed about it by the other
Friends, Rachel responded with the line "This

00:01:08.140 --> 00:01:11.840
isn't a marriage, this is just the world's
worst hangover!" which was superbly made up

00:01:11.840 --> 00:01:14.290
on the spot by Anniston.

00:01:14.290 --> 00:01:17.970
House
Hugh Laurie is an outrageously talented actor,

00:01:17.970 --> 00:01:21.580
so it should come as no surprise that one
of the funniest scenes in House - a medical

00:01:21.580 --> 00:01:25.760
drama in which he starred as the titular character
Gregory House - was totally ad libbed by the

00:01:25.760 --> 00:01:26.760
Brit.

00:01:26.760 --> 00:01:30.360
In the opening season two episode Acceptance,
Laurie's character was mad at James Wilson

00:01:30.360 --> 00:01:32.790
for having sided with Stacy Warner in a quarrel.

00:01:32.790 --> 00:01:36.460
In response to this, House said "Look, I know
you're friends with her, but there's a code!

00:01:36.460 --> 00:01:37.980
Bros before hos, man!"

00:01:37.980 --> 00:01:41.720
It was so unlike anything you'd expect him
to say that it was hilarious - and it was

00:01:41.720 --> 00:01:46.430
clear to see that Robert Sean Leonard who
plays WIlson was cracking up about it!

00:01:46.430 --> 00:01:49.620
Community
In the Introduction to Teaching episode of

00:01:49.620 --> 00:01:54.060
the great sitcom Community, one of the show's
main characters - Abed Nadir, played by Danny

00:01:54.060 --> 00:01:58.090
Pudi - begins taking a class discussing popular
Hollywood actor Nicolas Cage.

00:01:58.090 --> 00:02:02.440
When he gets up in front of the class to deliver
a presentation about Cage, Pudi improvises

00:02:02.440 --> 00:02:06.210
a scene in which he suddenly starts acting
like him - going totally crazy and speaking

00:02:06.210 --> 00:02:13.490
in an overly dramatic fashion, just like Cage
often does in his movie roles.

00:02:13.490 --> 00:02:16.760
Everyone in the class looks totally stunned
- and it's hardly surprising!

00:02:16.760 --> 00:02:21.160
They didn't expect to see Abed as Cage acting
like a "sexy cat" that day!

00:02:21.160 --> 00:02:23.489
Marvel's Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D.

00:02:23.489 --> 00:02:24.489
The Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D.

00:02:24.489 --> 00:02:29.010
season two finale was a two-part episode entitled
S.O.S.In the second part, S.H.I.E.L.D.

00:02:29.010 --> 00:02:32.950
agent Leo Fitz invented a high-tech device
that prevented the Inhuman character Gordon

00:02:32.950 --> 00:02:35.030
from using his teleportation powers.

00:02:35.030 --> 00:02:39.180
When Gordon asked how Fitz had managed to
do this, actor Iain de Caestecker improvised

00:02:39.180 --> 00:02:43.480
with the Breaking Bad-inspired response "Science,
biatch!"

00:02:43.480 --> 00:02:47.349
His co-star, Clark Gregg who plays Phil Coulson
in the show, tweeted that the line was the

00:02:47.349 --> 00:02:51.579
“Best ad lib in the history of television"
- and it's hard to argue with that.

00:02:51.579 --> 00:02:56.249
Buffy the Vampire Slayer
Joss Whedon is known for his brilliant writing,

00:02:56.249 --> 00:03:00.329
so when he's penning a script, very little
improvisation is required or requested.

00:03:00.329 --> 00:03:04.799
However, in Buffy the Vampire Slayer, an entire
exchange between two of the show's most beloved

00:03:04.799 --> 00:03:08.049
characters was entirely ad libbed by the actors
who played them.

00:03:08.049 --> 00:03:12.230
Alyson Hannigan's Willow Rosenberg and Seth
Green's Oz had a cute discussion about Animal

00:03:12.230 --> 00:03:16.140
Crackers in the episode What’s My Line Part
2 and the whole thing was made up on the spot

00:03:16.140 --> 00:03:24.879
- including the fun line Oz says about all
monkeys being French.

00:03:24.879 --> 00:03:28.909
Bob's Burgers
Bob's Burgers is an animated sitcom that is

00:03:28.909 --> 00:03:30.110
known for its vulgar humor.

00:03:30.110 --> 00:03:34.230
However, one of the best moments in the show
came in the episode entitled An Indecent Thanksgiving

00:03:34.230 --> 00:03:38.730
Proposal, which featured an improvised (and
completely non-vulgar) song by voice actor

00:03:38.730 --> 00:03:40.959
John Roberts, the voice of Linda Belcher.

00:03:40.959 --> 00:03:44.859
The song in question was "The Thanksgiving
Song" and was sung by Linda to annoy her husband

00:03:44.859 --> 00:03:49.700
Bob while he worked.

00:03:49.700 --> 00:03:53.689
Such was the song's popularity that it was
even covered by indie band The National and

00:03:53.689 --> 00:03:58.420
was cited by the show's writers as one of
their favourite numbers in the entire series.

00:03:58.420 --> 00:04:01.680
Scrubs
This entry is a little different to the others

00:04:01.680 --> 00:04:05.330
on this list, because it refers to almost
every scene involving a certain character

00:04:05.330 --> 00:04:08.050
in the brilliant medical comedy-drama Scrubs.

00:04:08.050 --> 00:04:13.859
Neil Flynn portrayed the mysterious and hilarious
Janitor in 166 episodes of the show and the

00:04:13.859 --> 00:04:17.500
show's main star, Zach Braff, has said that
the actor made up most of his lines.

00:04:17.500 --> 00:04:21.800
In fact, Braff has described Flynn as a "true
genius improviser" and has stated that the

00:04:21.800 --> 00:04:26.090
show's scripts would often simply say things
like "Neil makes something up and then exits".

00:04:26.090 --> 00:04:29.360
Having done that for eight years, you have
to give the guy a lot of credit for that - especially

00:04:29.360 --> 00:04:34.120
bearing in mind excellent lines like "I spent
the day inside that wall, thinking I was a

00:04:34.120 --> 00:04:37.220
merman..."

00:04:37.220 --> 00:04:41.259
The Simpsons
In The Simpsons episode You Only Move Twice,

00:04:41.259 --> 00:04:44.970
the brilliant Albert Brooks guest-starred
as the eccentric owner of the Globex Corporation

00:04:44.970 --> 00:04:47.400
- and Homer's new employer - Hank Scorpio.

00:04:47.400 --> 00:04:51.231
Scorpio seemed to be the perfect boss (before
being revealed to be an evil genius, that

00:04:51.231 --> 00:04:54.120
is) and encouraged Homer to implement his
own ideas.

00:04:54.120 --> 00:04:57.430
One of those ideas was that his team were
given hammocks, because working so hard was

00:04:57.430 --> 00:04:58.639
making them tired.

00:04:58.639 --> 00:05:02.419
When Homer went to Scorpio with the idea,
he loved it and Brooks improvised a scene

00:05:02.419 --> 00:05:05.710
in which he said hammocks could be purchased
at the nearby "Hammock District".

00:05:05.710 --> 00:05:09.810
Writer Josh Weinstein has since said that
Dan Castellaneta's reactions as Homer were

00:05:09.810 --> 00:05:13.840
"exactly like someone talking to Albert Brooks".

00:05:13.840 --> 00:05:18.090
Parks and Recreation
Given its incredibly talented comedy cast,

00:05:18.090 --> 00:05:21.389
you'd be forgiven for thinking that a lot
of Parks and Recreation was ad libbed - but

00:05:21.389 --> 00:05:22.440
you would also be wrong.

00:05:22.440 --> 00:05:26.030
That being said, one of the funniest lines
in the show's entire run was made up on the

00:05:26.030 --> 00:05:29.509
spot by none other than current Hollywood
superstar Chris Pratt.

00:05:29.509 --> 00:05:34.039
In the episode Flu Season, Pratt's character,
Andy Dwyer, typed his co-worker Leslie's sickness

00:05:34.039 --> 00:05:36.849
symptons into his computer to find out what
was wrong with her.

00:05:36.849 --> 00:05:40.560
In a completely improvised moment, Pratt's
character then stated that the computer had

00:05:40.560 --> 00:05:43.840
deduced that Leslie was suffering from "network
connectivity issues", which is undeniably

00:05:43.840 --> 00:05:44.840
brilliant.

00:05:44.840 --> 00:05:48.270
The Office
Ever since the original British version was

00:05:48.270 --> 00:05:52.080
airing, The Office had a reputation for having
some of the most awkward scenes in television

00:05:52.080 --> 00:05:55.960
history - but none were more awkward than
a hilarious improvised moment courtesy of

00:05:55.960 --> 00:05:58.099
Steve Carell in the U.S. adaptation of the
show.

00:05:58.099 --> 00:06:02.140
It came in the episode Gay Witch Hunt, when
Carell's character Michael Scott offended

00:06:02.140 --> 00:06:06.539
his employee Oscar Martinez by calling him
"faggy" without realising Oscar was actually

00:06:06.539 --> 00:06:07.860
homosexual.

00:06:07.860 --> 00:06:11.500
As a result, Michael attempted to reconcile
with him in front of his workforce by giving

00:06:11.500 --> 00:06:12.500
him a hug.

00:06:12.500 --> 00:06:16.090
The improvised moment came when Carell's character
added a kiss to the scene, shocking Oscar

00:06:16.090 --> 00:06:18.150
Nunez - the actor who played Oscar Martinez.

00:06:18.150 --> 00:06:22.270
The look you see on Nunez's face when the
kiss happens was a genuine reaction, and it's

00:06:22.270 --> 00:06:23.539
pretty damn funny.

00:06:23.539 --> 00:06:27.470
