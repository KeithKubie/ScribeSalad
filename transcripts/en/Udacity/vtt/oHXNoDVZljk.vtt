Points and vectors are mathematical entities representing locations and

00:00:04.110 --> 00:00:07.728
movements. When we give them coordinates, we're saying where they are or where

00:00:07.728 --> 00:00:11.400
they move in comparison to some frame of reference. We use three coordinate

00:00:11.400 --> 00:00:15.060
values for both a point and a vector. We've been keeping track in our heads

00:00:15.060 --> 00:00:18.334
whether a coordinate represents a point or a vector up to this point. You'll

00:00:18.334 --> 00:00:21.793
notice for matrix multiplication our coordinates have four values.
